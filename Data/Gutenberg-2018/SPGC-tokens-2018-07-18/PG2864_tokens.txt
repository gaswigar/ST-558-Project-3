and
preface
the
present
tale
is
founded
more
largely
on
testimony
oral
and
written
than
any
other
in
this
series
the
external
incidents
which
direct
its
course
are
mostly
an
unexaggerated
reproduction
of
the
recollections
of
old
persons
well
known
to
the
author
in
childhood
but
now
long
dead
who
were
of
those
scenes
if
wholly
transcribed
their
recollections
would
have
filled
a
volume
thrice
the
length
of
down
to
the
middle
of
this
century
and
later
there
were
not
wanting
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
places
more
or
less
clearly
indicated
herein
casual
relics
of
the
circumstances
amid
which
the
action
moves
our
preparations
for
defence
against
the
threatened
invasion
of
england
by
buonaparte
an
outhouse
door
riddled
with
which
had
been
extemporized
by
a
solitary
man
as
a
target
for
firelock
practice
when
the
landing
was
hourly
expected
a
heap
of
bricks
and
clods
on
a
which
had
formed
the
chimney
and
walls
of
the
hut
occupied
by
the
keeper
shafts
and
iron
heads
of
pikes
for
the
use
of
those
who
had
no
better
weapons
ridges
on
the
down
thrown
up
during
the
encampment
fragments
of
volunteer
uniform
and
other
such
lingering
remains
brought
to
my
imagination
in
early
childhood
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
date
of
the
war
more
vividly
than
volumes
of
history
could
have
done
those
who
have
attempted
to
construct
a
coherent
narrative
of
past
times
from
the
fragmentary
information
furnished
by
survivors
are
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
true
sequence
of
events
indiscriminately
recalled
for
this
purpose
the
newspapers
of
the
date
were
indispensable
of
other
documents
consulted
i
may
mention
for
the
satisfaction
of
those
who
love
a
true
story
that
the
to
all
ranks
and
descriptions
of
englishmen
was
transcribed
from
an
original
copy
in
a
local
museum
that
the
hieroglyphic
portrait
of
napoleon
existed
as
a
print
down
to
the
present
day
in
an
old
woman
cottage
near
that
the
particulars
of
the
king
doings
at
his
favourite
were
augmented
by
details
from
records
of
the
time
the
drilling
scene
of
the
local
militia
received
some
additions
from
an
account
given
in
so
grave
a
work
as
gifford
of
the
wars
of
the
french
revolution
london
but
on
reference
to
the
history
i
find
i
was
mistaken
in
supposing
the
account
to
be
advanced
as
authentic
or
to
refer
to
rural
england
however
it
does
in
a
large
degree
accord
with
the
local
traditions
of
such
scenes
that
i
have
heard
recounted
times
without
number
and
the
system
of
drill
was
tested
by
reference
to
the
army
regulations
of
and
other
military
handbooks
almost
the
whole
narrative
of
the
supposed
landing
of
the
french
in
the
bay
is
from
oral
relation
as
aforesaid
other
proofs
of
the
veracity
of
this
chronicle
have
escaped
my
recollection
i
what
was
seen
from
the
window
overlooking
the
down
in
the
days
of
and
women
when
the
vast
amount
of
soldiering
going
on
in
the
country
was
a
cause
of
much
trembling
to
the
sex
there
lived
in
a
village
near
the
wessex
coast
two
ladies
of
good
report
though
unfortunately
of
limited
means
the
elder
was
a
martha
garland
a
widow
and
the
other
was
her
only
daughter
anne
anne
was
fair
very
fair
in
a
poetical
sense
but
in
complexion
she
was
of
that
particular
tint
between
blonde
and
brunette
which
is
inconveniently
left
without
a
name
her
eyes
were
honest
and
inquiring
her
mouth
cleanly
cut
and
yet
not
classical
the
middle
point
of
her
upper
lip
scarcely
descending
so
far
as
it
should
have
done
by
rights
so
that
at
the
merest
pleasant
thought
not
to
mention
a
smile
portions
of
two
or
three
white
teeth
were
uncovered
whether
she
would
or
not
some
people
said
that
this
was
very
attractive
she
was
graceful
and
slender
and
though
but
little
above
five
feet
in
height
could
draw
herself
up
to
look
tall
in
her
manner
in
her
comings
and
goings
in
her
do
this
or
do
that
she
combined
dignity
with
sweetness
as
no
other
girl
could
do
and
any
impressionable
stranger
youths
who
passed
by
were
led
to
yearn
for
a
windfall
of
speech
from
her
and
to
see
at
the
same
time
that
they
would
not
get
it
in
short
beneath
all
that
was
charming
and
simple
in
this
young
woman
there
lurked
a
real
firmness
unperceived
at
first
as
the
speck
of
colour
lurks
unperceived
in
the
heart
of
the
palest
parsley
flower
she
wore
a
white
handkerchief
to
cover
her
white
neck
and
a
cap
on
her
head
with
a
pink
ribbon
round
it
tied
in
a
bow
at
the
front
she
had
a
great
variety
of
these
the
young
men
being
fond
of
sending
them
to
her
as
presents
until
they
fell
definitely
in
love
with
a
special
sweetheart
elsewhere
when
they
left
off
doing
so
between
the
border
of
her
cap
and
her
forehead
were
ranged
a
row
of
round
brown
curls
like
swallows
nests
under
eaves
she
lived
with
her
widowed
mother
in
a
portion
of
an
ancient
building
formerly
a
but
now
a
mill
which
being
too
large
for
his
own
requirements
the
miller
had
found
it
convenient
to
divide
and
appropriate
in
part
to
these
highly
respectable
tenants
in
this
dwelling
garland
and
anne
ears
were
soothed
morning
noon
and
night
by
the
music
of
the
mill
the
wheels
and
cogs
of
which
being
of
wood
produced
notes
that
might
have
borne
in
their
minds
a
remote
resemblance
to
the
wooden
tones
of
the
stopped
diapason
in
an
organ
occasionally
when
the
miller
was
bolting
there
was
added
to
these
continuous
sounds
the
cheerful
clicking
of
the
hopper
which
did
not
deprive
them
of
rest
except
when
it
was
kept
going
all
night
and
over
and
above
all
this
they
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
that
there
crept
in
through
every
crevice
door
and
window
of
their
dwelling
however
tightly
closed
a
subtle
mist
of
superfine
flour
from
the
grinding
room
quite
invisible
but
making
its
presence
known
in
the
course
of
time
by
giving
a
pallid
and
ghostly
look
to
the
best
furniture
the
miller
frequently
apologized
to
his
tenants
for
the
intrusion
of
this
insidious
dry
fog
but
the
widow
was
of
a
friendly
and
thankful
nature
and
she
said
that
she
did
not
mind
it
at
all
being
as
it
was
not
nasty
dirt
but
the
blessed
staff
of
life
by
of
this
sort
and
in
other
ways
garland
acknowledged
her
friendship
for
her
neighbour
with
whom
anne
and
herself
associated
to
an
extent
which
she
never
could
have
anticipated
when
tempted
by
the
lowness
of
the
rent
they
first
removed
thither
after
her
husband
death
from
a
larger
house
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
those
who
have
lived
in
remote
places
where
there
is
what
is
called
no
society
will
comprehend
the
gradual
levelling
of
distinctions
that
went
on
in
this
case
at
some
sacrifice
of
gentility
on
the
part
of
one
household
the
widow
was
sometimes
sorry
to
find
with
what
readiness
anne
caught
up
some
or
accent
from
the
miller
and
his
friends
but
he
was
so
good
and
a
man
and
she
so
unambitious
a
woman
that
she
would
not
make
life
a
solitude
for
fastidious
reasons
more
than
all
she
had
good
ground
for
thinking
that
the
miller
secretly
admired
her
and
this
added
a
piquancy
to
the
situation
on
a
fine
summer
morning
when
the
leaves
were
warm
under
the
sun
and
the
more
industrious
bees
abroad
diving
into
every
blue
and
red
cup
that
could
possibly
be
considered
a
flower
anne
was
sitting
at
the
back
window
of
her
mother
portion
of
the
house
measuring
out
lengths
of
worsted
for
a
fringed
rug
that
she
was
making
which
lay
about
quarters
finished
beside
her
the
work
though
chromatically
brilliant
was
tedious
a
was
a
thing
which
nobody
worked
at
from
morning
to
night
it
was
taken
up
and
put
down
it
was
in
the
chair
on
the
floor
across
the
under
the
bed
kicked
here
kicked
there
rolled
away
in
the
closet
brought
out
again
and
so
on
more
capriciously
perhaps
than
any
other
article
nobody
was
expected
to
finish
a
rug
within
a
calculable
period
and
the
wools
of
the
beginning
became
faded
and
historical
before
the
end
was
reached
a
sense
of
this
inherent
nature
of
rather
than
idleness
led
anne
to
look
rather
frequently
from
the
open
casement
immediately
before
her
was
the
large
smooth
millpond
and
intruding
into
the
hedge
and
into
the
road
the
water
with
its
flowing
leaves
and
spots
of
froth
was
stealing
away
like
time
under
the
dark
arch
to
tumble
over
the
great
slimy
wheel
within
on
the
other
side
of
the
was
an
open
place
called
the
cross
because
it
was
quarters
of
one
two
lanes
and
a
meeting
there
it
was
the
general
rendezvous
and
arena
of
the
surrounding
village
behind
this
a
steep
slope
rose
high
into
the
sky
merging
in
a
wide
and
open
down
now
littered
with
sheep
newly
shorn
the
upland
by
its
height
completely
sheltered
the
mill
and
village
from
north
winds
making
summers
of
springs
reducing
winters
to
autumn
temperatures
and
permitting
myrtle
to
flourish
in
the
open
air
the
heaviness
of
noon
pervaded
the
scene
and
under
its
influence
the
sheep
had
ceased
to
feed
nobody
was
standing
at
the
cross
the
few
inhabitants
being
indoors
at
their
dinner
no
human
being
was
on
the
down
and
no
human
eye
or
interest
but
anne
seemed
to
be
concerned
with
it
the
bees
still
worked
on
and
the
butterflies
did
not
rest
from
roving
their
smallness
seeming
to
shield
them
from
the
stagnating
effect
that
this
turning
moment
of
day
had
on
larger
creatures
otherwise
all
was
still
the
girl
glanced
at
the
down
and
the
sheep
for
no
particular
reason
the
steep
margin
of
turf
and
daisies
rising
above
the
roofs
chimneys
trees
and
church
tower
of
the
hamlet
around
her
bounded
the
view
from
her
position
and
it
was
necessary
to
look
somewhere
when
she
raised
her
head
while
thus
engaged
in
working
and
stopping
her
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sudden
rising
and
running
away
of
the
sheep
squatted
on
the
down
and
there
succeeded
sounds
of
a
heavy
tramping
over
the
hard
sod
which
the
sheep
had
quitted
the
tramp
being
accompanied
by
a
metallic
jingle
turning
her
eyes
further
she
beheld
two
cavalry
soldiers
on
bulky
grey
chargers
armed
and
accoutred
throughout
ascending
the
down
at
a
point
to
the
left
where
the
incline
was
comparatively
easy
the
burnished
chains
buckles
and
plates
of
their
trappings
shone
like
little
and
the
blue
red
and
white
about
them
was
unsubdued
by
weather
or
wear
the
two
troopers
rode
proudly
on
as
if
nothing
less
than
crowns
and
empires
ever
concerned
their
magnificent
minds
they
reached
that
part
of
the
down
which
lay
just
in
front
of
her
where
they
came
to
a
halt
in
another
minute
there
appeared
behind
them
a
group
containing
some
dozen
more
of
the
same
sort
these
came
on
halted
and
dismounted
likewise
two
of
the
soldiers
then
walked
some
distance
onward
together
when
one
stood
still
the
other
advancing
further
and
stretching
a
white
line
of
tape
between
them
two
more
of
the
men
marched
to
another
outlying
point
where
they
made
marks
in
the
ground
thus
they
walked
about
and
took
distances
obviously
according
to
some
preconcerted
scheme
at
the
end
of
this
systematic
proceeding
one
solitary
horseman
a
commissioned
officer
if
his
uniform
could
be
judged
rightly
at
that
distance
rode
up
the
down
went
over
the
ground
looked
at
what
the
others
had
done
and
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
good
and
then
the
girl
heard
yet
louder
tramps
and
clankings
and
she
beheld
rising
from
where
the
others
had
risen
a
whole
column
of
cavalry
in
marching
order
at
a
distance
behind
these
came
a
cloud
of
dust
enveloping
more
and
more
troops
their
arms
and
accoutrements
reflecting
the
sun
through
the
haze
in
faint
flashes
stars
and
streaks
of
light
the
whole
body
approached
slowly
towards
the
plateau
at
the
top
of
the
down
anne
threw
down
her
work
and
letting
her
eyes
remain
on
the
nearing
masses
of
cavalry
the
worsteds
getting
entangled
as
they
would
said
mother
come
here
here
such
a
fine
sight
what
does
it
mean
what
can
they
be
going
to
do
up
there
the
mother
thus
invoked
ran
upstairs
and
came
forward
to
the
window
she
was
a
woman
of
sanguine
mouth
and
eye
unheroic
manner
and
pleasant
general
appearance
a
little
more
tarnished
as
to
surface
but
not
much
worse
in
contour
than
the
girl
herself
widow
garland
thoughts
were
those
of
the
period
it
be
the
french
she
said
arranging
herself
for
the
extremest
form
of
consternation
that
of
mankind
have
landed
at
last
it
should
be
stated
that
at
this
time
there
were
two
of
mankind
satan
as
usual
and
buonaparte
who
had
sprung
up
and
eclipsed
his
elder
rival
altogether
garland
alluded
of
course
to
the
junior
gentleman
can
not
be
he
said
anne
there
simon
burden
the
man
who
watches
at
the
beacon
he
know
she
waved
her
hand
to
an
aged
form
of
the
same
colour
as
the
road
who
had
just
appeared
beyond
the
and
who
though
active
was
bowed
to
that
degree
which
almost
reproaches
a
feeling
observer
for
standing
upright
the
arrival
of
the
soldiery
had
drawn
him
out
from
his
drop
of
drink
at
the
of
york
as
it
had
attracted
anne
at
her
call
he
crossed
the
and
came
towards
the
window
anne
inquired
of
him
what
it
all
meant
but
simon
burden
without
answering
continued
to
move
on
with
parted
gums
staring
at
the
cavalry
on
his
own
private
account
with
a
concern
that
people
often
show
about
temporal
phenomena
when
such
matters
can
affect
them
but
a
short
time
longer
walk
into
the
millpond
said
anne
are
they
doing
you
were
a
soldier
many
years
ago
and
ought
to
know
ask
me
anne
said
the
military
relic
depositing
his
body
against
the
wall
one
limb
at
a
time
were
only
in
the
foot
ye
know
and
never
had
a
clear
understanding
of
horses
ay
i
be
a
old
man
and
of
no
judgment
now
some
additional
pressure
however
caused
him
to
search
further
in
his
magazine
of
ideas
and
he
found
that
he
did
know
in
a
dim
irresponsible
way
the
soldiers
must
have
come
there
to
camp
those
men
they
had
seen
first
were
the
markers
they
had
come
on
before
the
rest
to
measure
out
the
ground
he
who
had
accompanied
them
was
the
quartermaster
so
you
see
they
have
got
all
the
lines
marked
out
by
the
time
the
regiment
have
come
up
he
added
then
they
will
who
ha
supposed
that
overcombe
would
see
such
a
day
as
this
then
they
will
ah
it
gone
from
me
again
said
simon
and
then
they
will
raise
their
tents
you
know
and
picket
their
horses
that
was
it
so
it
was
by
this
time
the
column
of
horse
had
ascended
into
full
view
and
they
formed
a
lively
spectacle
as
they
rode
along
the
high
ground
in
marching
order
backed
by
the
pale
blue
sky
and
lit
by
the
southerly
sun
their
uniform
was
bright
and
attractive
white
buckskin
pantaloons
boots
scarlet
shakos
set
off
with
lace
mustachios
waxed
to
a
needle
point
and
above
all
those
richly
ornamented
blue
jackets
mantled
with
the
historic
pelisse
that
fascination
to
women
and
encumbrance
to
the
wearers
themselves
the
york
hussars
said
simon
burden
brightening
like
a
dying
ember
fanned
to
a
man
and
enrolled
long
since
my
time
but
as
good
hearty
comrades
they
say
as
you
find
in
the
king
service
are
more
and
different
ones
said
garland
other
troops
had
during
the
last
few
minutes
been
ascending
the
down
at
a
remoter
point
and
now
drew
near
these
were
of
different
weight
and
build
from
the
others
lighter
men
in
helmet
hats
with
white
plumes
do
know
which
i
like
best
said

i
think
after
all
simon
who
had
been
looking
hard
at
the
latter
now
said
that
they
were
the
th
dragoons
englishmen
they
said
the
old
man
lay
at
budmouth
barracks
a
few
years
ago
did
i
remember
it
said

lots
of
the
chaps
about
here
at
the
time
said
simon
can
call
to
mind
that
there
was
ah
is
gone
from
me
again
however
all
that
of
little
account
now
the
dragoons
passed
in
front
of
the
as
the
others
had
done
and
their
gay
plumes
which
had
hung
lazily
during
the
ascent
swung
to
northward
as
they
reached
the
top
showing
that
on
the
summit
a
fresh
breeze
blew
look
across
there
said
anne
there
had
entered
upon
the
down
from
another
direction
several
battalions
of
foot
in
white
kerseymere
breeches
and
cloth
gaiters
they
seemed
to
be
weary
from
a
long
march
the
original
black
of
their
gaiters
and
boots
being
brown
with
dust
presently
came
regimental
waggons
and
the
private
canteen
carts
which
followed
at
the
end
of
a
convoy
the
space
in
front
of
the
was
now
occupied
by
nearly
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
who
had
turned
out
in
alarm
and
remained
for
pleasure
their
eyes
lighted
up
with
interest
in
what
they
saw
for
trappings
and
regimentals
war
horses
and
men
in
towns
an
attraction
were
here
almost
a
sublimity
the
troops
filed
to
their
lines
dismounted
and
in
quick
time
took
off
their
accoutrements
rolled
up
their
picketed
and
unbitted
their
horses
and
made
ready
to
erect
the
tents
as
soon
as
they
could
be
taken
from
the
waggons
and
brought
forward
when
this
was
done
at
a
given
signal
the
canvases
flew
up
from
the
sod
and
thenceforth
every
man
had
a
place
in
which
to
lay
his
head
though
nobody
seemed
to
be
looking
on
but
the
few
at
the
window
and
in
the
village
street
there
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
eyes
converging
upon
that
military
arrival
in
its
high
and
conspicuous
position
not
to
mention
the
glances
of
birds
and
other
wild
creatures
men
in
distant
gardens
women
in
orchards
and
at
shepherds
on
remote
hills
in
enclosures
miles
away
captains
with
out
at
sea
were
regarding
the
picture
keenly
those
three
or
four
thousand
men
of
one
movement
some
of
them
swashbucklers
by
nature
others
doubtless
of
a
quiet
disposition
who
had
inadvertently
got
into
uniform
all
of
them
had
arrived
from
nobody
knew
where
and
hence
were
matter
of
great
curiosity
they
seemed
to
the
mere
eye
to
belong
to
a
different
order
of
beings
from
those
who
inhabited
the
valleys
below
apparently
unconscious
and
careless
of
what
all
the
world
was
doing
elsewhere
they
remained
picturesquely
engrossed
in
the
business
of
making
themselves
a
habitation
on
the
isolated
spot
which
they
had
chosen
garland
was
of
a
festive
and
sanguine
turn
of
mind
a
woman
soon
set
up
and
soon
set
down
and
the
coming
of
the
regiments
quite
excited
her
she
thought
there
was
reason
for
putting
on
her
best
cap
thought
that
perhaps
there
was
not
that
she
would
hurry
on
the
dinner
and
go
out
in
the
afternoon
then
that
she
would
after
all
do
nothing
unusual
nor
show
any
silly
excitements
whatever
since
they
were
unbecoming
in
a
mother
and
a
widow
thus
circumscribing
her
intentions
till
she
was
toned
down
to
an
ordinary
person
of
forty
garland
accompanied
her
daughter
downstairs
to
dine
saying
we
will
call
on
miller
loveday
and
hear
what
he
thinks
of
it
all
ii
somebody
knocks
and
comes
in
miller
loveday
was
the
representative
of
an
ancient
family
of
whose
history
is
lost
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
his
ancestral
line
was
contemporaneous
with
that
of
de
ros
howard
and
de
la
zouche
but
owing
to
some
trifling
deficiency
in
the
possessions
of
the
house
of
loveday
the
individual
names
and
intermarriages
of
its
members
were
not
recorded
during
the
middle
ages
and
thus
their
private
lives
in
any
given
century
were
uncertain
but
it
was
known
that
the
family
had
formed
matrimonial
alliances
with
farmers
not
so
very
small
and
once
with
a
who
had
for
many
years
purchased
after
their
death
the
horses
of
the
most
aristocratic
persons
in
the
county
fiery
steeds
that
earlier
in
their
career
had
been
valued
at
many
hundred
guineas
it
was
also
ascertained
that
loveday
had
been
eight
in
number
and
his
sixteen
every
one
of
whom
reached
to
years
of
discretion
at
every
stage
backwards
his
sires
and
gammers
thus
doubled
and
doubled
till
they
became
a
vast
body
of
gothic
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
rank
known
as
ceorls
or
villeins
full
of
importance
to
the
country
at
large
and
ramifying
throughout
the
unwritten
history
of
england
his
immediate
father
had
greatly
improved
the
value
of
their
residence
by
building
a
new
chimney
and
setting
up
an
additional
pair
of
millstones
overcombe
mill
presented
at
one
end
the
appearance
of
a
house
slipping
into
the
river
and
at
the
other
of
an
idle
genteel
place
cloaked
with
creepers
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
having
no
visible
connexion
with
flour
it
had
hips
instead
of
gables
giving
it
a
shouldered
look
four
chimneys
with
no
smoke
coming
out
of
them
two
zigzag
cracks
in
the
wall
several
open
windows
with
a
here
and
there
inside
showing
its
warped
back
to
the
snowy
dimity
curtains
waving
in
the
draught
two
mill
doors
one
above
the
other
the
upper
enabling
a
person
to
step
out
upon
nothing
at
a
height
of
ten
feet
from
the
ground
a
gaping
arch
vomiting
the
river
and
a
lean
fellow
looking
out
from
the
mill
doorway
who
was
the
hired
grinder
except
when
a
bulging
fifteen
stone
man
occupied
the
same
place
namely
the
miller
himself
behind
the
mill
door
and
invisible
to
the
mere
wayfarer
who
did
not
visit
the
family
were
chalked
addition
and
subtraction
sums
many
of
them
originally
done
wrong
and
the
figures
half
rubbed
out
and
corrected
noughts
being
turned
into
nines
and
ones
into
twos
these
were
the
miller
private
calculations
there
were
also
chalked
in
the
same
place
rows
and
rows
of
strokes
like
open
palings
representing
the
calculations
of
the
grinder
who
in
his
youthful
ciphering
studies
had
not
gone
so
far
as
arabic
figures
in
the
court
in
front
were
two
millstones
made
useful
again
by
being
let
in
level
with
the
ground
here
people
stood
to
smoke
and
consider
things
in
muddy
weather
and
cats
slept
on
the
clean
surfaces
when
it
was
hot
in
the
large
at
the
corner
of
the
garden
was
erected
a
pole
of
larch
fir
which
the
miller
had
bought
with
others
at
a
sale
of
small
timber
in
damer
wood
one
christmas
week
it
rose
from
the
upper
boughs
of
the
tree
to
about
the
height
of
a
mast
and
on
the
top
was
a
vane
in
the
form
of
a
sailor
with
his
arm
stretched
out
when
the
sun
shone
upon
this
figure
it
could
be
seen
that
the
greater
part
of
his
countenance
was
gone
and
the
paint
washed
from
his
body
so
far
as
to
reveal
that
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
red
before
he
became
a
sailor
in
blue
the
image
had
in
fact
been
john
one
of
our
coming
characters
and
was
then
turned
into
robert
another
of
them
this
revolving
piece
of
statuary
could
not
however
be
relied
on
as
a
vane
owing
to
the
neighbouring
hill
which
formed
variable
currents
in
the
wind
the
leafy
and
quieter
wing
of
the
was
the
part
occupied
by
garland
and
her
daughter
who
made
up
in
for
the
narrowness
of
their
quarters
by
overflowing
into
the
garden
on
stools
and
chairs
the
parlour
or
had
a
stone
floor
a
fact
which
the
widow
sought
to
disguise
by
double
carpeting
lest
the
standing
of
anne
and
herself
should
be
lowered
in
the
public
eye
here
now
the
meal
went
lightly
and
mincingly
on
as
it
does
where
there
is
no
greedy
carnivorous
man
to
keep
the
dishes
about
and
was
hanging
on
the
close
when
somebody
entered
the
passage
as
far
as
the
chink
of
the
parlour
door
and
tapped
this
proceeding
was
probably
adopted
to
kindly
avoid
giving
trouble
to
susan
the
neighbour
pink
daughter
who
helped
at
garland
in
the
mornings
but
was
at
that
moment
particularly
occupied
in
standing
on
the
and
gazing
at
the
soldiers
with
an
inhaling
position
of
the
mouth
and
circular
eyes
there
was
a
flutter
in
the
little
the
sensitiveness
of
habitual
solitude
makes
hearts
beat
for
preternaturally
small
reasons
and
a
guessing
as
to
who
the
visitor
might
be
it
was
some
military
gentleman
from
the
camp
perhaps
no
that
was
impossible
it
was
the
parson
no
he
would
not
come
at
it
was
the
man
who
travelled
with
drapery
and
the
best
birmingham
earrings
not
at
all
his
time
was
not
till
thursday
at
three
before
they
could
think
further
the
visitor
moved
forward
another
step
and
the
diners
got
a
glimpse
of
him
through
the
same
friendly
chink
that
had
afforded
him
a
view
of
the
garland
it
is
only
loveday
this
approximation
to
nobody
was
the
miller
above
mentioned
a
hale
man
of
or
sixty
hale
all
through
as
many
were
in
those
days
and
not
merely
veneered
with
purple
by
exhilarating
victuals
and
drinks
though
the
latter
were
not
at
all
despised
by
him
his
face
was
indeed
rather
pale
than
otherwise
for
he
had
just
come
from
the
mill
it
was
capable
of
immense
changes
of
expression
mobility
was
its
essence
a
roll
of
flesh
forming
a
buttress
to
his
nose
on
each
side
and
a
deep
ravine
lying
between
his
lower
lip
and
the
tumulus
represented
by
his
chin
these
fleshy
lumps
moved
stealthily
as
if
of
their
own
accord
whenever
his
fancy
was
tickled
his
eyes
having
lighted
on
the
plates
and
viands
he
found
himself
in
a
position
which
had
a
sensible
awkwardness
for
a
modest
man
who
always
liked
to
enter
only
at
seasonable
times
the
presence
of
a
girl
of
such
pleasantly
soft
ways
as
anne
garland
she
who
could
make
apples
seem
like
peaches
and
throw
over
her
shillings
the
glamour
of
guineas
when
she
paid
him
for
flour
is
over
neighbour
loveday
please
come
in
said
the
widow
seeing
his
case
the
miller
said
something
about
coming
in
presently
but
anne
pressed
him
to
stay
with
a
tender
motion
of
her
lip
as
it
played
on
the
verge
of
a
solicitous
smile
without
quite
lapsing
into
one
her
habitual
manner
when
speaking
loveday
took
off
his
hat
and
advanced
he
had
not
come
about
pigs
or
fowls
this
time
have
been
looking
out
like
the
rest
us
no
doubt
garland
at
the
mampus
of
soldiers
that
have
come
upon
the
down
well
one
of
the
horse
regiments
is
the
th
dragoons
my
son
john
regiment
you
know
the
announcement
though
it
interested
them
did
not
create
such
an
effect
as
the
father
of
john
had
seemed
to
anticipate
but
anne
who
liked
to
say
pleasant
things
replied
dragoons
looked
nicer
than
the
foot
or
the
german
cavalry
either
are
a
handsome
body
of
men
said
the
miller
in
a
disinterested
voice
i
did
know
they
were
coming
though
it
may
be
in
the
newspaper
all
the
time
but
old
derriman
keeps
it
so
long
that
we
never
know
things
till
they
be
in
everybody
mouth
this
derriman
was
a
squireen
living
near
who
was
chiefly
distinguished
in
the
present
warlike
time
by
having
a
nephew
in
the
yeomanry
were
told
that
the
yeomanry
went
along
the
turnpike
road
yesterday
said
anne
they
say
that
they
were
a
pretty
sight
and
quite
soldierly
well
they
be
not
regulars
said
miller
loveday
keeping
back
harsher
criticism
as
uncalled
for
but
inflamed
by
the
arrival
of
the
dragoons
which
had
been
the
exciting
cause
of
his
call
his
mind
would
not
go
to
yeomanry
has
not
been
home
these
five
years
he
said
what
rank
does
he
hold
now
said
the
widow
and
a
good
musician
the
miller
who
was
a
good
father
went
on
to
explain
that
john
had
seen
some
service
too
he
had
enlisted
when
the
regiment
was
lying
in
this
neighbourhood
more
than
eleven
years
before
which
put
his
father
out
of
temper
with
him
as
he
had
wished
him
to
follow
on
at
the
mill
but
as
the
lad
had
enlisted
seriously
and
as
he
had
often
said
that
he
would
be
a
soldier
the
miller
had
thought
that
he
would
let
jack
take
his
chance
in
the
profession
of
his
choice
loveday
had
two
sons
and
the
second
was
now
brought
into
the
conversation
by
a
remark
of
anne
that
neither
of
them
seemed
to
care
for
the
miller
business
said
loveday
in
a
less
buoyant
tone
you
see
must
needs
go
to
sea
is
much
younger
than
his
brother
said
garland
about
four
years
the
miller
told
her
his
soldier
son
was
and
bob
was
when
bob
returned
from
his
present
voyage
he
was
to
be
persuaded
to
stay
and
assist
as
grinder
in
the
mill
and
go
to
sea
no
more
said
anne
he
knows
as
much
about
mill
business
as
i
do
said
loveday
was
intended
for
it
you
know
like
john
but
bless
me
he
continued
am
before
my
story
i
come
more
particularly
to
ask
you
and
you
anne
my
honey
if
you
will
join
me
and
a
few
friends
at
a
leetle
homely
supper
that
i
shall
to
please
the
chap
now
he
come
i
can
do
no
less
than
have
a
bit
of
a
randy
as
the
saying
is
now
that
here
safe
and
sound
garland
wanted
to
catch
her
daughter
eye
she
was
in
some
doubt
about
her
answer
but
anne
eye
was
not
to
be
caught
for
she
hated
hints
nods
and
calculations
of
any
kind
in
matters
which
should
be
regulated
by
impulse
and
the
matron
replied
so
be
is
possible
we
be
there
you
will
tell
us
the
day
he
would
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
son
john
be
rather
untidy
you
know
owing
to
my
having
no
womenfolks
in
the
house
and
my
man
david
is
a
poor
feller
for
getting
up
a
feast
poor
chap
his
sight
is
bad
that
true
and
he
very
good
at
making
the
beds
and
oiling
the
legs
of
the
chairs
and
other
furniture
or
i
should
have
got
rid
of
him
years
ago
should
have
a
woman
to
attend
to
the
house
loveday
said
the
widow
i
should
but
well
is
a
fine
day
neighbours
hark
i
fancy
i
hear
the
noise
of
pots
and
pans
up
at
the
camp
or
my
ears
deceive
me
poor
fellows
they
must
be
hungry
good
day
and
the
miller
went
away
all
that
afternoon
overcombe
continued
in
a
ferment
of
interest
in
the
military
investment
which
brought
the
excitement
of
an
invasion
without
the
strife
there
were
great
discussions
on
the
merits
and
appearance
of
the
soldiery
the
event
opened
up
to
the
girls
unbounded
possibilities
of
adoring
and
being
adored
and
to
the
young
men
an
embarrassment
of
dashing
acquaintances
which
quite
superseded
falling
in
love
thirteen
of
these
lads
incontinently
stated
within
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
like
going
for
a
soldier
the
young
women
stated
little
but
perhaps
thought
the
more
though
in
justice
they
glanced
round
towards
the
encampment
from
the
corners
of
their
blue
and
brown
eyes
in
the
most
demure
and
modest
manner
that
could
be
desired
in
the
evening
the
village
was
lively
with
soldiers
wives
a
tree
full
of
starlings
would
not
have
rivalled
the
chatter
that
was
going
on
these
ladies
were
very
brilliantly
dressed
with
more
regard
for
colour
than
for
material
purple
red
and
blue
bonnets
were
numerous
with
bunches
of
cocks
feathers
and
one
had
on
an
arcadian
hat
of
green
sarcenet
turned
up
in
front
to
show
her
cap
underneath
it
had
once
belonged
to
an
officer
lady
and
was
not
so
much
stained
except
where
the
occasional
storms
of
rain
incidental
to
a
military
life
had
caused
the
green
to
run
and
stagnate
in
curious
watermarks
like
peninsulas
and
islands
some
of
the
prettiest
of
these
butterfly
wives
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
get
lodgings
in
the
cottages
and
were
thus
spared
the
necessity
of
living
in
huts
and
tents
on
the
down
those
who
had
not
been
so
fortunate
were
not
rendered
more
amiable
by
the
success
of
their
and
called
them
names
which
brought
forth
retorts
and
rejoinders
till
the
end
of
these
alternative
remarks
seemed
dependent
upon
the
close
of
the
day
one
of
these
new
arrivals
who
had
a
rosy
nose
and
a
slight
thickness
of
voice
which
as
anne
said
she
could
help
poor
thing
seemed
to
have
seen
so
much
of
the
world
and
to
have
been
in
so
many
campaigns
that
anne
would
have
liked
to
take
her
into
their
own
house
so
as
to
acquire
some
of
that
practical
knowledge
of
the
history
of
england
which
the
lady
possessed
and
which
could
not
be
got
from
books
but
the
narrowness
of
garland
rooms
absolutely
forbade
this
and
the
houseless
treasury
of
experience
was
obliged
to
look
for
quarters
elsewhere
that
night
anne
retired
early
to
bed
the
events
of
the
day
cheerful
as
they
were
in
themselves
had
been
unusual
enough
to
give
her
a
slight
headache
before
getting
into
bed
she
went
to
the
window
and
lifted
the
white
curtains
that
hung
across
it
the
moon
was
shining
though
not
as
yet
into
the
valley
but
just
peeping
above
the
ridge
of
the
down
where
the
white
cones
of
the
encampment
were
softly
touched
by
its
light
the
and
foremost
tents
showed
themselves
prominently
but
the
body
of
the
camp
the
officers
tents
kitchens
canteen
and
appurtenances
in
the
rear
were
blotted
out
by
the
ground
because
of
its
height
above
her
she
could
discern
the
forms
of
one
or
two
sentries
moving
to
and
fro
across
the
disc
of
the
moon
at
intervals
she
could
hear
the
frequent
shuffling
and
tossing
of
the
horses
tied
to
the
pickets
and
in
the
other
direction
the
voice
of
the
sea
whispering
a
louder
note
at
those
points
of
its
length
where
hampered
in
its
ebb
and
flow
by
some
jutting
promontory
or
group
of
boulders
louder
sounds
suddenly
broke
this
approach
to
silence
they
came
from
the
camp
of
dragoons
were
taken
up
further
to
the
right
by
the
camp
of
the
hanoverians
and
further
on
still
by
the
body
of
infantry
it
was
tattoo
feeling
no
desire
to
sleep
she
listened
yet
longer
looked
at
charles
wain
swinging
over
the
church
tower
and
the
moon
ascending
higher
and
higher
over
the
streets
of
tents
where
instead
of
parade
and
bustle
there
was
nothing
going
on
but
snores
and
dreams
the
tired
soldiers
lying
by
this
time
under
their
proper
canvases
radiating
like
spokes
from
the
pole
of
each
tent
at
last
anne
gave
up
thinking
and
retired
like
the
rest
the
night
wore
on
and
except
the
occasional
well
of
the
sentries
no
voice
was
heard
in
the
camp
or
in
the
village
below
iii
the
mill
becomes
an
important
centre
of
operations
the
next
morning
miss
garland
awoke
with
an
impression
that
something
more
than
usual
was
going
on
and
she
recognized
as
soon
as
she
could
clearly
reason
that
the
proceedings
whatever
they
might
be
lay
not
far
away
from
her
bedroom
window
the
sounds
were
chiefly
those
of
pickaxes
and
shovels
anne
got
up
and
lifting
the
corner
of
the
curtain
about
an
inch
peeped
out
a
number
of
soldiers
were
busily
engaged
in
making
a
zigzag
path
down
the
incline
from
the
camp
to
the
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
judging
from
the
quantity
of
work
already
got
through
they
must
have
begun
very
early
squads
of
men
were
working
at
several
equidistant
points
in
the
proposed
pathway
and
by
the
time
that
anne
had
dressed
herself
each
section
of
the
length
had
been
connected
with
those
above
and
below
it
so
that
a
continuous
and
easy
track
was
formed
from
the
crest
of
the
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
steep
the
down
rested
on
a
bed
of
solid
chalk
and
the
surface
exposed
by
the
roadmakers
formed
a
white
ribbon
serpenting
from
top
to
bottom
then
the
relays
of
working
soldiers
all
disappeared
and
not
long
after
a
troop
of
dragoons
in
watering
order
rode
forward
at
the
top
and
began
to
wind
down
the
new
path
they
came
lower
and
closer
and
at
last
were
immediately
beneath
her
window
gathering
themselves
up
on
the
space
by
the
a
number
of
the
horses
entered
it
at
the
shallow
part
drinking
and
splashing
and
tossing
about
perhaps
as
many
as
thirty
half
of
them
with
riders
on
their
backs
were
in
the
water
at
one
time
the
thirsty
animals
drank
stamped
flounced
and
drank
again
letting
the
clear
cool
water
dribble
luxuriously
from
their
mouths
miller
loveday
was
looking
on
from
over
his
garden
hedge
and
many
admiring
villagers
were
gathered
around
gazing
up
higher
anne
saw
other
troops
descending
by
the
new
road
from
the
camp
those
which
had
already
been
to
the
pond
making
room
for
these
by
withdrawing
along
the
village
lane
and
returning
to
the
top
by
a
circuitous
route
suddenly
the
miller
exclaimed
as
in
fulfilment
of
expectation
john
my
boy
good
morning
and
the
reply
of
father
came
from
a
soldier
near
him
who
did
not
however
form
one
of
the
watering
party
anne
could
not
see
his
face
very
clearly
but
she
had
no
doubt
that
this
was
john
loveday
there
were
tones
in
the
voice
which
reminded
her
of
old
times
those
of
her
very
infancy
when
johnny
loveday
had
been
top
boy
in
the
village
school
and
had
wanted
to
learn
painting
of
her
father
the
deeps
and
shallows
of
the
being
better
known
to
him
than
to
any
other
man
in
the
camp
he
had
apparently
come
down
on
that
account
and
was
cautioning
some
of
the
horsemen
against
riding
too
far
in
towards
the
since
her
childhood
and
his
enlistment
anne
had
seen
him
only
once
and
then
but
casually
when
he
was
home
on
a
short
furlough
his
figure
was
not
much
changed
from
what
it
had
been
but
the
many
sunrises
and
sunsets
which
had
passed
since
that
day
developing
her
from
a
comparative
child
to
womanhood
had
abstracted
some
of
his
angularities
reddened
his
skin
and
given
him
a
foreign
look
it
was
interesting
to
see
what
years
of
training
and
service
had
done
for
this
man
few
would
have
supposed
that
the
white
and
the
blue
coats
of
miller
and
soldier
covered
the
forms
of
father
and
son
before
the
last
troop
of
dragoons
rode
off
they
were
welcomed
in
a
body
by
miller
loveday
who
still
stood
in
his
outer
garden
this
being
a
plot
lying
below
the
and
stretching
to
the
it
was
just
the
time
of
year
when
cherries
are
ripe
and
hang
in
clusters
under
their
dark
leaves
while
the
troopers
loitered
on
their
horses
and
chatted
to
the
miller
across
the
stream
he
gathered
bunches
of
the
fruit
and
held
them
up
over
the
garden
hedge
for
the
acceptance
of
anybody
who
would
have
them
whereupon
the
soldiers
rode
into
the
water
to
where
it
had
washed
holes
in
the
garden
bank
and
reining
their
horses
there
caught
the
cherries
in
their
or
received
bunches
of
them
on
the
ends
of
their
switches
with
the
dignified
laugh
that
became
martial
men
when
stooping
to
slightly
boyish
amusement
it
was
a
cheerful
careless
unpremeditated
which
returned
like
the
scent
of
a
flower
to
the
memories
of
some
of
those
who
enjoyed
it
even
at
a
distance
of
many
years
after
when
they
lay
wounded
and
weak
in
foreign
lands
then
dragoons
and
horses
wheeled
off
as
the
others
had
done
and
troops
of
the
german
legion
next
came
down
and
entered
in
panoramic
procession
the
space
below
anne
eyes
as
if
on
purpose
to
gratify
her
these
were
notable
by
their
mustachios
and
queues
wound
tightly
with
brown
ribbon
to
the
level
of
their
broad
they
were
charmed
as
the
others
had
been
by
the
head
and
neck
of
miss
garland
in
the
little
square
window
overlooking
the
scene
of
operations
and
saluted
her
with
devoted
foreign
civility
and
in
such
overwhelming
numbers
that
the
modest
girl
suddenly
withdrew
herself
into
the
room
and
had
a
private
blush
between
the
chest
of
drawers
and
the
when
she
came
downstairs
her
mother
said
have
been
thinking
what
i
ought
to
wear
to
miller
loveday
miller
loveday
said
anne
the
party
is
he
has
been
in
here
this
morning
to
tell
me
that
he
has
seen
his
son
and
they
have
fixed
this
evening
you
think
we
ought
to
go
mother
said
anne
slowly
and
looking
at
the
smaller
features
of
the
not
said
garland
will
only
have
men
there
except
ourselves
will
he
and
shall
we
be
right
to
go
alone
among
anne
had
not
recovered
from
the
ardent
gaze
of
the
gallant
york
hussars
whose
voices
reached
her
even
now
in
converse
with
loveday
anne
how
proud
you
are
said
widow
garland
is
he
our
nearest
neighbour
and
our
landlord
and
do
he
always
fetch
our
faggots
from
the
wood
and
keep
us
in
vegetables
for
next
to
nothing
true
said
anne
we
ca
be
distant
with
the
man
and
if
the
enemy
land
next
autumn
as
everybody
says
they
will
we
shall
have
quite
to
depend
upon
the
miller
waggon
and
horses
he
our
only
friend
so
he
is
said
anne
you
had
better
go
mother
and
stay
at
home
they
will
be
all
men
and
i
do
like
going
garland
reflected
if
you
do
want
to
go
i
do
she
said
as
you
are
growing
up
it
would
be
better
to
stay
at
home
this
time
your
father
was
a
professional
man
certainly
having
spoken
as
a
mother
she
sighed
as
a
woman
do
you
sigh
mother
are
so
prim
and
stiff
about
everything
well
we
go
no
i
am
not
sure
that
we
ought
i
did
not
promise
and
there
will
be
no
trouble
in
keeping
away
anne
apparently
did
not
feel
certain
of
her
own
opinion
and
instead
of
supporting
or
contradicting
looked
thoughtfully
down
and
abstractedly
brought
her
hands
together
on
her
bosom
till
her
fingers
met
tip
to
tip
as
the
day
advanced
the
young
woman
and
her
mother
became
aware
that
great
preparations
were
in
progress
in
the
miller
wing
of
the
house
the
partitioning
between
the
lovedays
and
the
garlands
was
not
very
thorough
consisting
in
many
cases
of
a
simple
screwing
up
of
the
doors
in
the
dividing
walls
and
thus
when
the
mill
began
any
new
performances
they
proclaimed
themselves
at
once
in
the
more
private
dwelling
the
smell
of
miller
loveday
pipe
came
down
garland
chimney
of
an
evening
with
the
greatest
regularity
every
time
that
he
poked
his
fire
they
knew
from
the
vehemence
or
deliberateness
of
the
blows
the
precise
state
of
his
mind
and
when
he
wound
his
clock
on
sunday
nights
the
whirr
of
that
monitor
reminded
the
widow
to
wind
hers
this
transit
of
noises
was
most
perfect
where
loveday
lobby
adjoined
garland
pantry
and
anne
who
was
occupied
for
some
time
in
the
latter
apartment
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
hearing
the
visitors
arrive
and
of
catching
stray
sounds
and
words
without
the
connecting
phrases
that
made
them
entertaining
to
judge
from
the
laughter
they
evoked
the
arrivals
passed
through
the
house
and
went
into
the
garden
where
they
had
tea
in
a
large
an
occasional
blink
of
bright
colour
through
the
foliage
being
all
that
was
visible
of
the
assembly
from
garland
windows
when
it
grew
dusk
they
all
could
be
heard
coming
indoors
to
finish
the
evening
in
the
parlour
then
there
was
an
intensified
continuation
of
the
signs
of
enjoyment
talkings
and
runnings
upstairs
and
runnings
down
a
slamming
of
doors
and
a
clinking
of
cups
and
glasses
till
the
proudest
adjoining
tenant
without
friends
on
his
own
side
of
the
partition
might
have
been
tempted
to
wish
for
entrance
to
that
merry
dwelling
if
only
to
know
the
cause
of
these
fluctuations
of
hilarity
and
to
see
if
the
guests
were
really
so
numerous
and
the
observations
so
very
amusing
as
they
seemed
the
stagnation
of
life
on
the
garland
side
of
the
began
to
have
a
very
gloomy
effect
by
the
contrast
when
about
nine
one
of
these
tantalizing
bursts
of
gaiety
had
resounded
for
a
longer
time
than
usual
anne
said
believe
mother
that
you
are
wishing
you
had
gone
own
to
feeling
that
it
would
have
been
very
cheerful
if
we
had
joined
in
said
garland
in
a
hankering
tone
was
rather
too
nice
in
listening
to
you
and
not
going
the
parson
never
calls
upon
us
except
in
his
spiritual
capacity
old
derriman
is
hardly
genteel
and
nobody
left
to
speak
to
lonely
people
must
accept
what
company
they
can
get
do
without
it
altogether
not
natural
anne
and
i
am
surprised
to
hear
a
young
woman
like
you
say
such
a
thing
nature
will
not
be
stifled
in
that
way
song
and
powerful
chorus
heard
through
partition
declare
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
seems
quite
a
paradise
compared
with
this
you
are
quite
a
girl
said
anne
in
slightly
superior
accents
in
and
join
them
by
all
means
no
not
now
said
her
mother
resignedly
shaking
her
head
is
too
late
now
we
ought
to
have
taken
advantage
of
the
invitation
they
would
look
hard
at
me
as
a
poor
mortal
who
had
no
real
business
there
and
the
miller
would
say
with
his
broad
smile
ah
you
be
obliged
to
come
round
while
the
sociable
and
unaspiring
garland
continued
thus
to
pass
the
evening
in
two
places
her
body
in
her
own
house
and
her
mind
in
the
miller
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
and
directly
after
the
elder
loveday
himself
was
admitted
to
the
room
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
between
grand
and
gay
which
he
used
for
such
occasions
as
the
present
and
his
blue
coat
yellow
and
red
waistcoat
with
the
three
lower
buttons
unfastened
shoes
and
speckled
stockings
became
him
very
well
in
martha
garland
eyes
servant
said
the
miller
adopting
as
a
matter
of
propriety
the
raised
standard
of
politeness
required
by
his
higher
costume
begging
your
pardon
i
ca
hae
this
is
unnatural
that
you
two
ladies
should
be
biding
here
and
we
under
the
same
roof
making
merry
without
ye
your
husband
poor
man
lovely
picters
that
a
would
make
to
be
sure
would
have
been
in
with
us
long
ago
if
he
had
been
in
your
place
i
can
take
no
nay
from
ye
upon
my
honour
you
and
maidy
anne
must
come
in
if
it
be
only
for
john
and
his
friends
have
got
passes
till
twelve
and
saving
a
few
of
our
own
village
folk
the
lowest
visitor
present
is
a
very
genteel
german
corporal
if
you
should
hae
any
misgivings
on
the
score
of
respectability
we
pack
off
the
underbred
ones
into
the
back
kitchen
widow
garland
and
anne
looked
yes
at
each
other
after
this
appeal
follow
you
in
a
few
minutes
said
the
elder
smiling
and
she
rose
with
anne
to
go
upstairs
i
wait
for
ye
said
the
miller
doggedly
perhaps
alter
your
mind
again
while
the
mother
and
daughter
were
upstairs
dressing
and
saying
laughingly
to
each
other
we
must
go
now
as
if
they
wished
to
go
all
the
evening
other
steps
were
heard
in
the
passage
and
the
miller
cried
from
below
pardon
garland
but
my
son
john
has
come
to
help
fetch
ye
shall
i
ask
him
in
till
ye
be
ready
i
shall
be
down
in
a
minute
screamed
anne
mother
in
a
slanting
voice
towards
the
staircase
when
she
descended
the
outline
of
the
appeared
down
the
passage
is
john
said
the
miller
simply
you
can
mind
martha
garland
very
well
well
indeed
said
the
dragoon
coming
in
a
little
further
should
have
called
to
see
her
last
time
but
i
was
only
home
a
week
how
is
your
little
girl
garland
said
anne
was
quite
well
is
now
she
will
be
down
in
a
moment
there
was
a
slight
noise
of
military
heels
without
the
door
at
which
the
went
and
put
his
head
outside
and
said
right
coming
in
a
minute
when
voices
in
the
darkness
replied
hurry
friends
said
garland
it
is
only
buck
and
jones
come
to
fetch
me
said
the
soldier
i
ask
in
a
minute
mrs
garland
yes
said
the
lady
and
the
two
interesting
forms
of
trumpeter
buck
and
jones
then
came
forward
in
the
most
friendly
manner
whereupon
other
steps
were
heard
without
and
it
was
discovered
that
brett
and
johnson
were
outside
having
come
to
fetch
buck
and
jones
as
buck
and
jones
had
come
to
fetch
the
as
there
seemed
a
possibility
of
garland
small
passage
being
choked
up
with
human
figures
personally
unknown
to
her
she
was
relieved
to
hear
anne
coming
downstairs
my
little
girl
said
garland
and
the
looked
with
a
sort
of
awe
upon
the
muslin
apparition
who
came
forward
and
stood
quite
dumb
before
her
anne
recognized
him
as
the
trooper
she
had
seen
from
her
window
and
welcomed
him
kindly
there
was
something
in
his
honest
face
which
made
her
feel
instantly
at
home
with
him
at
this
frankness
of
manner
loveday
who
was
not
a
ladies
man
blushed
and
made
some
alteration
in
his
bodily
posture
began
a
sentence
which
had
no
end
and
showed
quite
a
boy
embarrassment
recovering
himself
he
politely
offered
his
arm
which
anne
took
with
a
very
pretty
grace
he
conducted
her
through
his
comrades
who
glued
themselves
perpendicularly
to
the
wall
to
let
her
pass
and
then
they
went
out
of
the
door
her
mother
following
with
the
miller
and
supported
by
the
body
of
troopers
the
latter
walking
with
the
usual
cavalry
gait
as
if
their
thighs
were
rather
too
long
for
them
thus
they
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
up
the
passage
the
paving
of
which
was
worn
into
a
gutter
by
the
ebb
and
flow
of
feet
that
had
been
going
on
there
ever
since
tudor
times
iv
who
were
present
at
the
miller
little
entertainment
when
the
group
entered
the
presence
of
the
company
a
lull
in
the
conversation
was
caused
by
the
sight
of
new
visitors
and
of
course
by
the
charm
of
anne
appearance
until
the
old
men
who
had
daughters
of
their
own
perceiving
that
she
was
only
a
girl
resumed
their
tales
and
with
unconcern
miller
loveday
had
fraternized
with
half
the
soldiers
in
the
camp
since
their
arrival
and
the
effect
of
this
upon
his
party
was
striking
both
chromatically
and
otherwise
those
among
the
guests
who
first
attracted
the
eye
were
the
sergeants
and
of
loveday
regiment
fine
hearty
men
who
sat
facing
the
candles
entirely
resigned
to
physical
comfort
then
there
were
other
officers
a
german
two
hungarians
and
a
swede
from
the
foreign
hussars
young
men
with
a
look
of
sadness
on
their
faces
as
if
they
did
not
much
like
serving
so
far
from
home
all
of
them
spoke
english
fairly
well
old
age
was
represented
by
simon
burden
the
pensioner
and
the
shady
side
of
fifty
by
corporal
tullidge
his
friend
and
neighbour
who
was
hard
of
hearing
and
sat
with
his
hat
on
over
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
that
was
wound
several
times
round
his
head
these
two
veterans
were
employed
as
watchers
at
the
neighbouring
beacon
which
had
lately
been
erected
by
the
for
firing
whenever
the
descent
on
the
coast
should
be
made
they
lived
in
a
little
hut
on
the
hill
close
by
the
heap
of
faggots
but
they
had
found
deputies
to
watch
in
their
stead
on
a
lower
plane
of
experience
and
qualifications
came
neighbour
james
comfort
of
the
volunteers
a
soldier
by
courtesy
but
a
blacksmith
by
rights
also
william
tremlett
and
anthony
cripplestraw
of
the
local
forces
the
two
latter
men
of
war
were
dressed
merely
as
villagers
and
looked
upon
the
regulars
from
a
humble
position
in
the
background
the
remainder
of
the
party
was
made
up
of
a
neighbouring
dairyman
or
two
and
their
wives
invited
by
the
miller
as
anne
was
glad
to
see
that
she
and
her
mother
should
not
be
the
only
women
there
the
elder
loveday
apologized
in
a
whisper
to
garland
for
the
presence
of
the
inferior
villagers
as
they
are
learning
to
be
brave
defenders
of
their
home
and
country
as
fast
as
they
can
master
the
drill
and
have
worked
for
me
off
and
on
these
many
years
i
asked
in
and
thought
you
excuse
it
miller
loveday
said
the
widow
the
same
of
old
burden
and
tullidge
they
have
served
well
and
long
in
the
foot
and
even
now
have
a
hard
time
of
it
up
at
the
beacon
in
wet
weather
so
after
giving
them
a
meal
in
the
kitchen
i
just
asked
in
to
hear
the
singing
they
faithfully
promise
that
as
soon
as
ever
the
gunboats
appear
in
view
and
they
have
fired
the
beacon
to
run
down
here
first
in
case
we
should
see
it
is
worth
while
to
be
friendly
with
you
see
though
their
tempers
be
queer
worth
while
miller
said
she
anne
was
rather
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
regular
military
in
such
force
and
at
first
confined
her
words
to
the
dairymen
wives
she
was
acquainted
with
and
to
the
two
old
soldiers
of
the
parish
did
ye
speak
to
me
afore
chiel
said
one
of
these
corporal
tullidge
the
elderly
man
with
the
hat
while
she
was
talking
to
old
simon
burden
met
ye
in
the
lane
yesterday
he
added
reproachfully
ye
did
notice
me
at
all
am
very
sorry
for
it
she
said
but
being
afraid
to
shout
in
such
a
company
the
effect
of
her
remark
upon
the
corporal
was
as
if
she
had
not
spoken
at
all
was
coming
along
with
yer
head
full
of
some
high
notions
or
other
no
doubt
continued
the
uncompromising
corporal
in
the
same
loud
voice
is
the
young
bucks
that
get
all
the
notice
nowadays
and
old
folks
are
quite
forgot
i
can
mind
well
enough
how
young
bob
loveday
used
to
lie
in
wait
for
ye
anne
blushed
deeply
and
stopped
his
too
excursive
discourse
by
hastily
saying
that
she
always
respected
old
folks
like
him
the
corporal
thought
she
inquired
why
he
always
kept
his
hat
on
and
answered
that
it
was
because
his
head
was
injured
at
valenciennes
in
july
were
trying
to
bomb
down
the
tower
and
a
piece
of
the
shell
struck
me
i
was
no
more
nor
less
than
a
dead
man
for
two
days
if
it
had
a
been
for
that
and
my
smashed
arm
i
should
have
come
home
none
the
worse
for
my
years
service
have
got
a
silver
plate
let
into
yer
head
have
ye
corpel
said
anthony
cripplestraw
who
had
drawn
near
have
heard
that
the
way
they
morticed
yer
skull
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
workmanship
perhaps
the
young
woman
would
like
to
see
the
place
is
a
curious
sight
anne
you
do
see
such
a
wownd
every
day
thank
you
said
anne
hurriedly
dreading
as
did
all
the
young
people
of
overcombe
the
spectacle
of
the
corporal
uncovered
he
had
never
been
seen
in
public
without
the
hat
and
the
handkerchief
since
his
return
in
and
strange
stories
were
told
of
the
ghastliness
of
his
appearance
a
little
boy
who
had
accidentally
beheld
him
going
to
bed
in
that
state
having
been
frightened
into
fits
if
the
young
woman
do
want
to
see
yer
head
maybe
she
like
to
hear
yer
arm
continued
cripplestraw
earnest
to
please
her
said
the
corporal
arm
hurt
too
cried
anne
to
a
pummy
at
the
same
time
as
my
head
said
tullidge
dispassionately
yer
arm
corpel
and
show
her
said
cripplestraw
sure
said
the
corporal
raising
the
limb
slowly
as
if
the
glory
of
exhibition
had
lost
some
of
its
novelty
though
he
was
willing
to
oblige
twisting
it
mercilessly
about
with
his
right
hand
he
produced
a
crunching
among
the
bones
at
every
motion
cripplestraw
seeming
to
derive
great
satisfaction
from
the
ghastly
sound
very
shocking
said
anne
painfully
anxious
for
him
to
leave
off
it
do
hurt
him
bless
ye
do
it
corpel
said
cripplestraw
a
bit
said
the
corporal
still
working
his
arm
with
great
energy
no
life
in
the
bones
at
all
no
life
in
i
tell
her
corpel
at
all
be
as
loose
as
a
bag
of
ninepins
explained
cripplestraw
in
continuation
can
feel
quite
plain
anne
if
ye
would
like
to
he
undo
his
sleeve
in
a
minute
to
oblege
ye
no
no
please
not
i
quite
understand
said
the
young
woman
she
want
to
hear
or
see
any
more
or
do
she
the
corporal
inquired
with
a
sense
that
his
time
was
getting
wasted
anne
explained
that
she
did
not
on
any
account
and
managed
to
escape
from
the
corner
the
song
and
the
stranger
the
now
contrived
to
place
himself
near
her
presence
having
evidently
been
a
great
pleasure
to
him
since
the
moment
of
his
first
seeing
her
she
was
quite
at
her
ease
with
him
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
that
buonaparte
would
really
come
during
the
summer
and
many
other
questions
which
the
gallant
dragoon
could
not
answer
but
which
he
nevertheless
liked
to
be
asked
william
tremlett
who
had
not
enjoyed
a
sound
night
rest
since
the
first
consul
menace
had
become
known
pricked
up
his
ears
at
sound
of
this
subject
and
inquired
if
anybody
had
seen
the
terrible
boats
that
the
enemy
were
to
cross
in
brother
robert
saw
several
of
them
paddling
about
the
shore
the
last
time
he
passed
the
straits
of
dover
said
the
and
he
further
startled
the
company
by
informing
them
that
there
were
supposed
to
be
more
than
fifteen
hundred
of
these
boats
and
that
they
would
carry
a
hundred
men
apiece
so
that
a
descent
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
might
be
expected
any
day
as
soon
as
boney
had
brought
his
plans
to
bear
ha
mercy
upon
us
said
william
tremlett
is
when
they
will
try
it
if
they
try
it
at
all
said
old
tullidge
in
the
tone
of
one
whose
watch
at
the
beacon
must
in
the
nature
of
things
have
given
him
comprehensive
views
of
the
situation
is
my
belief
that
the
point
they
will
choose
for
making
the
shore
is
just
over
there
and
he
nodded
with
indifference
towards
a
section
of
the
coast
at
a
hideous
nearness
to
the
house
in
which
they
were
assembled
whereupon
fencible
tremlett
and
cripplestraw
of
the
locals
tried
to
show
no
signs
of
trepidation
d
think
be
said
volunteer
comfort
the
blacksmith
ca
answer
to
a
day
said
the
corporal
it
will
certainly
be
in
a
tide
and
instead
of
pulling
hard
against
it
he
let
his
boats
drift
and
that
will
bring
right
into
budmouth
bay
be
a
beautiful
stroke
of
war
if
so
be
is
quietly
done
said
cripplestraw
moving
inside
his
clothes
how
if
we
should
be
all
abed
corpel
you
ca
expect
a
man
to
be
brave
in
his
shirt
especially
we
locals
that
have
only
got
so
far
as
shoulder
locks
not
coming
this
summer
he
never
come
at
all
said
a
tall
decisively
loveday
the
soldier
was
too
much
engaged
in
attending
upon
anne
and
her
mother
to
join
in
these
surmises
bestirring
himself
to
get
the
ladies
some
of
the
best
liquor
the
house
afforded
which
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
crossed
the
channel
as
privately
as
buonaparte
wished
his
army
to
do
and
had
been
landed
on
a
dark
night
over
the
cliff
after
this
he
asked
anne
to
sing
but
though
she
had
a
very
pretty
voice
in
private
performances
of
that
nature
she
declined
to
oblige
him
turning
the
subject
by
making
a
hesitating
inquiry
about
his
brother
robert
whom
he
had
mentioned
just
before
is
as
well
as
ever
thank
you
miss
garland
he
said
is
now
mate
of
the
brig
pewit
rather
young
for
such
a
command
but
the
owner
puts
great
trust
in
him
the
added
deepening
his
thoughts
to
a
profounder
view
of
the
person
discussed
is
in
love
anne
looked
conscious
and
listened
attentively
but
loveday
did
not
go
on
she
asked
ca
exactly
say
and
the
strange
part
of
it
is
that
he
never
tells
us
who
the
woman
is
nobody
knows
at
all
will
tell
of
course
said
anne
in
the
remote
tone
of
a
person
with
whose
sex
such
matters
had
no
connexion
whatever
loveday
shook
his
head
and
the
was
put
an
end
to
by
a
burst
of
singing
from
one
of
the
sergeants
who
was
followed
at
the
end
of
his
song
by
others
each
giving
a
ditty
in
his
turn
the
singer
standing
up
in
front
of
the
table
stretching
his
chin
well
into
the
air
as
though
to
abstract
every
possible
wrinkle
from
his
throat
and
then
plunging
into
the
melody
when
this
was
over
one
of
the
foreign
hussars
the
genteel
german
of
miller
loveday
description
who
called
himself
a
hungarian
and
in
reality
belonged
to
no
definite
country
performed
at
loveday
request
the
series
of
wild
motions
that
he
denominated
his
national
dance
that
anne
might
see
what
it
was
like
miss
garland
was
the
flower
of
the
whole
company
the
soldiers
one
and
all
foreign
and
english
seemed
to
be
quite
charmed
by
her
presence
as
indeed
they
well
might
be
considering
how
seldom
they
came
into
the
society
of
such
as
she
anne
and
her
mother
were
just
thinking
of
retiring
to
their
own
dwelling
when
sergeant
stanner
of
the
th
foot
who
was
recruiting
at
budmouth
began
a
satirical
song
when
strive
to
heal
a
breach
and
what
they
preach
then
he
pounce
down
and
march
his
men
on
town
when
hold
scales
and
rogues
are
found
in
jails
then
he
pounce
down
and
march
his
men
on
town
when
rich
men
find
their
wealth
a
curse
and
fill
the
poor
man
purse
then
he
pounce
down
and
march
his
men
on
town
poor
stanner
in
spite
of
his
satire
he
fell
at
the
bloody
battle
of
albuera
a
few
years
after
this
pleasantly
spent
summer
at
the
georgian
being
mortally
wounded
and
trampled
down
by
a
french
hussar
when
the
brigade
was
deploying
into
line
under
beresford
while
miller
loveday
was
saying
done
mr
stanner
at
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
stanza
which
seemed
to
be
the
last
and
stanner
was
modestly
expressing
his
regret
that
he
could
do
no
better
a
stentorian
voice
was
heard
outside
the
window
shutter
repeating
the
company
was
silent
in
a
moment
at
this
reinforcement
and
only
the
military
tried
not
to
look
surprised
while
all
wondered
who
the
singer
could
be
somebody
entered
the
porch
the
door
opened
and
in
came
a
young
man
about
the
size
and
weight
of
the
farnese
hercules
in
the
uniform
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
young
squire
derriman
old
derriman
nephew
murmured
voices
in
the
background
without
waiting
to
address
anybody
or
apparently
seeing
who
were
gathered
there
the
colossal
man
waved
his
cap
above
his
head
and
went
on
in
tones
that
shook
the
when
with
their
wives
agree
and
maids
wo
wed
from
then
he
pounce
down
and
march
his
men
on
town
it
was
a
verse
which
had
been
omitted
by
the
gallant
stanner
out
of
respect
to
the
ladies
the
was
and
of
florid
complexion
and
seemed
full
of
a
conviction
that
his
whim
of
entering
must
be
their
pleasure
which
for
the
moment
it
was
ceremony
good
men
all
he
said
was
passing
by
and
my
ear
was
caught
by
the
singing
i
like
singing
is
warming
and
cheering
and
shall
not
be
put
down
i
should
like
to
hear
anybody
say
otherwise
master
derriman
said
the
miller
filling
a
glass
and
handing
it
to
the
yeoman
all
the
way
from
quarters
then
i
hardly
knowed
ye
in
your
soldier
clothes
you
look
more
natural
with
a
spud
in
your
hand
sir
i
should
ha
known
ye
at
all
if
i
had
heard
that
you
were
called
out
natural
with
a
spud
have
a
care
miller
said
the
young
giant
the
fire
of
his
complexion
increasing
to
scarlet
do
mean
anger
but
but
a
soldier
honour
you
know
the
military
in
the
background
laughed
a
little
and
the
yeoman
then
for
the
first
time
discovered
that
there
were
more
regulars
present
than
one
he
looked
momentarily
disconcerted
but
expanded
again
to
full
assurance
right
master
derriman
no
offence
was
only
my
joke
said
the
genial
miller
a
soldier
nowadays
drink
a
drap
o
this
cordial
and
do
mind
words
the
young
man
drank
without
the
least
reluctance
and
said
miller
i
am
called
out
is
ticklish
times
for
us
soldiers
now
we
hold
our
lives
in
our
hands
what
are
those
fellows
grinning
at
behind
the
table
i
say
we
do
with
your
uncle
at
the
farm
for
a
day
or
two
mr
derriman
no
as
i
told
you
six
mile
off
billeted
at
casterbridge
but
i
have
to
call
and
see
the
old
old
no
skinflint
he
lives
upon
the
sweepings
of
the
barton
ha
ha
and
the
speaker
regular
white
teeth
showed
themselves
like
snow
in
a
dutch
cabbage
well
the
profession
of
arms
makes
a
man
proof
against
all
that
i
take
things
as
i
find
right
master
derriman
another
drop
no
i
take
no
more
than
is
good
for
me
no
man
should
so
tempt
me
the
yeoman
then
saw
anne
and
by
an
unconscious
gravitation
went
towards
her
and
the
other
women
flinging
a
remark
to
john
loveday
in
passing
loveday
i
heard
you
were
come
in
short
i
come
o
purpose
to
see
you
glad
to
see
you
enjoying
yourself
at
home
again
the
replied
civilly
though
not
without
grimness
for
he
seemed
hardly
to
like
derriman
motion
towards
anne
garland
daughter
yes

surely
you
remember
me
i
have
been
here
before
festus
derriman
yeomanry
cavalry
anne
gave
a
little
curtsey
know
your
name
is
festus
that
all
is
well
known
especially
latterly
he
dropped
his
voice
to
confidence
pitch
suppose
your
friends
here
are
disturbed
by
my
coming
in
as
they
do
seem
to
talk
much
i
do
mean
to
interrupt
the
party
but
i
often
find
that
people
are
put
out
by
my
coming
among
especially
when
i
got
my
regimentals
on
and
are
they
is
the
way
i
have
he
further
lowered
his
tone
as
if
they
had
been
old
friends
though
in
reality
he
had
only
seen
her
three
or
four
times
how
did
you
come
to
be
here
dash
my
wig
i
do
like
to
see
a
nice
young
lady
like
you
in
this
company
you
should
come
to
some
of
our
yeomanry
sprees
in
casterbridge
or
o
but
the
girls
do
come
the
yeomanry
are
respected
men
men
of
good
substantial
families
many
farming
their
own
land
and
every
one
among
us
rides
his
own
charger
which
is
more
than
these
cussed
fellows
do
he
nodded
towards
the
dragoons
hush
why
these
are
friends
and
neighbours
of
miller
loveday
and
he
is
a
great
friend
of
ours
our
best
friend
said
anne
with
great
emphasis
and
reddening
at
the
sense
of
injustice
to
their
host
are
you
thinking
of
talking
like
that
it
is
ungenerous
in
you
ha
i
affronted

it
may
be

but
i
do
like
ye
please
be
quiet
said
anne
distressed
will
i
will
well
corporal
tullidge
how
your
head
he
said
going
towards
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
leaving
anne
to
herself
the
company
had
again
recovered
its
liveliness
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
bouncing
rufus
who
had
joined
them
could
find
heart
to
tear
himself
away
from
their
society
and
good
liquors
although
he
had
had
quite
enough
of
the
latter
before
he
entered
the
natives
received
him
at
his
own
valuation
and
the
soldiers
of
the
camp
who
sat
beyond
the
table
smiled
behind
their
pipes
at
his
remarks
with
a
pleasant
twinkle
of
the
eye
which
approached
the
satirical
john
loveday
being
not
the
least
conspicuous
in
this
bearing
but
he
and
his
friends
were
too
courteous
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
to
challenge
the
young
large
remarks
and
readily
permitted
him
to
set
them
right
on
the
details
of
camping
and
other
military
routine
about
which
the
troopers
seemed
willing
to
let
persons
hold
any
opinion
whatever
provided
that
they
themselves
were
not
obliged
to
give
attention
to
it
showing
strangely
enough
that
if
there
was
one
subject
more
than
another
which
never
interested
their
minds
it
was
the
art
of
war
to
them
the
art
of
enjoying
good
company
in
overcombe
mill
the
details
of
the
household
the
swarming
of
his
bees
the
number
of
his
chickens
and
the
fatness
of
his
pigs
were
matters
of
infinitely
greater
concern
the
present
writer
to
whom
this
party
has
been
described
times
out
of
number
by
members
of
the
loveday
family
and
other
aged
people
now
passed
away
can
never
enter
the
old
of
overcombe
mill
without
beholding
the
genial
scene
through
the
mists
of
the
seventy
or
eighty
years
that
intervene
between
then
and
now
first
and
brightest
to
the
eye
are
the
dozen
candles
scattered
about
regardless
of
expense
and
kept
well
snuffed
by
the
miller
who
walks
round
the
room
at
intervals
of
five
minutes
snuffers
in
hand
and
nips
each
wick
with
great
precision
and
with
something
of
an
executioner
grim
look
upon
his
face
as
he
closes
the
snuffers
upon
the
neck
of
the
candle
next
to
the
show
the
red
and
blue
coats
and
white
breeches
of
the
soldiers
nearly
twenty
of
them
in
all
besides
the
ponderous
derriman
the
head
of
the
latter
and
indeed
the
heads
of
all
who
are
standing
up
being
in
dangerous
proximity
to
the
black
beams
of
the
ceiling
there
is
not
one
among
them
who
would
attach
any
meaning
to
or
gather
from
the
syllables
the
remotest
idea
of
his
own
glory
or
death
next
appears
the
correct
and
innocent
anne
little
thinking
what
things
time
has
in
store
for
her
at
no
great
distance
off
she
looks
at
derriman
with
a
smile
as
he
clanks
hither
and
thither
and
hopes
he
will
not
single
her
out
again
to
hold
a
private
dialogue
with
which
however
he
does
irresistibly
attracted
by
the
white
muslin
figure
she
must
of
course
look
a
little
gracious
again
now
lest
his
mood
should
turn
from
sentimental
to
quarrelsome
no
impossible
contingency
with
the
as
her
quick
perception
had
noted
well
this
idling
wo
do
for
me
folks
he
at
last
said
to
anne
relief
ought
not
to
have
come
in
by
rights
but
i
heard
you
enjoying
yourselves
and
thought
it
might
be
worth
while
to
see
what
you
were
up
to
i
have
several
miles
to
go
before
bedtime
and
stretching
his
arms
lifting
his
chin
and
shaking
his
head
to
eradicate
any
unseemly
curve
or
wrinkle
from
his
person
the
yeoman
wished
them
an
hand
and
departed
should
have
teased
him
a
little
more
father
said
the
drily
could
soon
have
made
him
as
crabbed
as
a
bear
did
want
to
provoke
the
chap
was
worth
while
he
came
in
friendly
enough
said
the
gentle
miller
without
looking
up
do
think
he
was
overmuch
friendly
said
john
as
well
to
be
neighbourly
with
folks
if
they
be
not
quite
onbearable
his
father
genially
replied
as
he
took
off
his
coat
to
go
and
draw
more
ale
this
periodical
stripping
to
the
being
necessitated
by
the
narrowness
of
the
cellar
and
the
smeary
effect
of
its
numerous
cobwebs
upon
best
clothes
some
of
the
guests
then
spoke
of
fess
derriman
as
not
such
a
bad
young
man
if
you
took
him
right
and
humoured
him
others
said
that
he
was
nobody
enemy
but
his
own
and
the
elder
ladies
mentioned
in
a
tone
of
interest
that
he
was
likely
to
come
into
a
deal
of
money
at
his
death
the
person
who
did
not
praise
was
the
one
who
knew
him
best
who
had
known
him
as
a
boy
years
ago
when
he
had
lived
nearer
to
overcombe
than
he
did
at
present
this
unappreciative
person
was
the
vi
old
derriman
of
oxwell
hall
at
this
time
in
the
history
of
overcombe
one
solitary
newspaper
occasionally
found
its
way
into
the
village
it
was
lent
by
the
postmaster
at
budmouth
who
in
some
mysterious
way
got
it
for
nothing
through
his
connexion
with
the
mail
to
derriman
at
the
hall
by
whom
it
was
handed
on
to
garland
when
it
was
not
more
than
a
fortnight
old
whoever
remembers
anything
about
the
old
will
of
course
know
well
enough
that
this
delightful
privilege
of
reading
history
in
long
columns
was
not
accorded
to
the
widow
garland
for
nothing
it
was
by
such
ingenuous
means
that
he
paid
her
for
her
daughter
occasional
services
in
reading
aloud
to
him
and
making
out
his
accounts
in
which
matters
the
farmer
whose
guineas
were
reported
to
touch
five
figures
some
said
more
was
not
expert
martha
garland
as
a
respectable
widow
occupied
a
twilight
rank
between
the
benighted
villagers
and
the
gentry
and
kindly
made
herself
useful
to
the
former
as
and
reader
and
general
translator
from
the
printing
tongue
it
was
not
without
satisfaction
that
she
stood
at
her
door
of
an
evening
newspaper
in
hand
with
three
or
four
cottagers
standing
round
and
poured
down
their
open
throats
any
paragraph
that
she
might
choose
to
select
from
the
stirring
ones
of
the
period
when
she
had
done
with
the
sheet
garland
passed
it
on
to
the
miller
the
miller
to
the
grinder
and
the
grinder
to
the
grinder
boy
in
whose
hands
it
became
subdivided
into
half
pages
quarter
pages
and
irregular
triangles
and
ended
its
career
as
a
paper
cap
a
flagon
bung
or
a
wrapper
for
his
bread
and
cheese
notwithstanding
his
compact
with
garland
old
derriman
kept
the
paper
so
long
and
was
so
chary
of
wasting
his
man
time
on
a
merely
intellectual
errand
that
unless
she
sent
for
the
journal
it
seldom
reached
her
hands
anne
was
always
her
messenger
the
arrival
of
the
soldiers
led
garland
to
despatch
her
daughter
for
it
the
day
after
the
party
and
away
she
went
in
her
hat
and
pelisse
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
that
of
the
encampment
on
the
hill
walking
across
the
fields
for
the
distance
of
a
mile
or
two
she
came
out
upon
the
by
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
was
the
entrance
to
what
at
first
sight
looked
like
a
neglected
meadow
the
gate
being
a
rotten
one
without
a
bottom
rail
and
palings
lying
on
each
side
the
dry
hard
mud
of
the
opening
was
marked
with
several
horse
and
cow
tracks
that
had
been
half
obliterated
by
fifty
score
sheep
tracks
surcharged
with
the
tracks
of
a
man
and
a
dog
beyond
this
geological
record
appeared
a
nearly
grown
over
with
grass
which
anne
followed
it
descended
by
a
gentle
slope
dived
under
elm
and
chestnut
trees
and
conducted
her
on
till
the
hiss
of
a
waterfall
and
the
sound
of
the
sea
became
audible
when
it
took
a
bend
round
a
swamp
of
fresh
watercress
and
brooklime
that
had
once
been
a
fish
pond
here
the
grey
front
of
a
building
edged
from
behind
the
trees
it
was
oxwell
hall
once
the
seat
of
a
family
now
extinct
and
of
late
years
used
as
a
farmhouse
benjamin
derriman
who
owned
the
crumbling
place
had
originally
been
only
the
occupier
and
of
the
fields
around
his
wife
had
brought
him
a
small
fortune
and
during
the
growth
of
their
only
son
there
had
been
a
partition
of
the
oxwell
estate
giving
the
farmer
now
a
widower
the
opportunity
of
acquiring
the
building
and
a
small
portion
of
the
land
attached
on
exceptionally
low
terms
but
two
years
after
the
purchase
the
boy
died
and
derriman
existence
was
paralyzed
forthwith
it
was
said
that
since
that
event
he
had
devised
the
house
and
fields
to
a
distant
female
relative
to
keep
them
out
of
the
hands
of
his
detested
nephew
but
this
was
not
certainly
known
the
hall
was
as
interesting
as
mansions
in
a
state
of
declension
usually
are
as
the
excellent
county
history
showed
that
popular
work
in
folio
contained
an
old
plate
dedicated
to
the
last
scion
of
the
original
owners
from
which
drawing
it
appeared
that
in
the
date
of
publication
the
windows
were
covered
with
little
scratches
like
black
flashes
of
lightning
that
a
horn
of
hard
smoke
came
out
of
each
of
the
twelve
chimneys
that
a
lady
and
a
stood
on
the
lawn
in
a
strenuously
walking
position
and
a
substantial
cloud
and
nine
flying
birds
of
no
known
species
hung
over
the
trees
to
the
the
rambling
and
neglected
dwelling
had
all
the
romantic
excellencies
and
practical
drawbacks
which
such
mildewed
places
share
in
common
with
caves
mountains
wildernesses
glens
and
other
homes
of
poesy
that
people
of
taste
wish
to
live
and
die
in
mustard
and
cress
could
have
been
raised
on
the
inner
plaster
of
the
dewy
walls
at
any
height
not
exceeding
three
feet
from
the
floor
and
mushrooms
of
the
most
refined
and
kinds
grew
up
through
the
chinks
of
the
larder
paving
as
for
the
outside
nature
in
the
ample
time
that
had
been
given
her
had
so
mingled
her
filings
and
effacements
with
the
marks
of
human
wear
and
tear
upon
the
house
that
it
was
often
hard
to
say
in
which
of
the
two
or
if
in
both
any
particular
obliteration
had
its
origin
the
keenness
was
gone
from
the
mouldings
of
the
doorways
but
whether
worn
out
by
the
rubbing
past
of
innumerable
people
shoulders
and
the
moving
of
their
heavy
furniture

by
time
in
a
grander
and
more
abstract
form

the

eaten
away

at
the

they
entered
the
stone
the
condensed
breathings
of
generations
having
settled
there
in
pools
and
rusted
them
the
panes
themselves
had
either
lost
their
shine
altogether
or
become
iridescent

a
peacock
tail

the
middle
of
the
porch
was
a
vertical
whose
gnomon
swayed
loosely
about

its
shadow

screened
the
main

over
it

the

reached
by
a
spiral
staircase
across
the
archway
was
fixed
a
row
of
wooden
hurdles

of

closed

apparent

soon

large
with

ones
surprisingly
small
in
the
groined
porch
some
heifers
were
amusing
themselves
by
stretching
up
their
necks
and
licking
the
carved
stone
capitals
that
supported
the
vaulting
anne
went
on
to
a
second
and
open
door
across
which
was
another
hurdle
to
keep
the
live
stock
from
absolute
community
with
the
inmates
there
being
no
knocker
she
knocked
by
means
of
a
short
stick
which
was
laid
against
the
post
for
that
purpose
but
nobody
attending
she
entered
the
passage
and
tried
an
inner
door
a
slight
noise
was
heard
inside
the
door
opened
about
an
inch
and
a
strip
of
decayed
face
including
the
eye
and
some
forehead
wrinkles
appeared
within
the
crevice
i
have
come
for
the
paper
said
anne
is
it
you
dear
anne
whined
the
inmate
opening
the
door
a
little
further
could
hardly
get
to
the
door
to
open
it
i
am
so
weak
the
speaker
was
a
wizened
old
gentleman
in
a
coat
the
colour
of
his
farmyard
breeches
of
the
same
hue
unbuttoned
at
the
knees
revealing
a
bit
of
leg
above
his
stocking
and
a
dazzlingly
white
to
compensate
for
this
untidiness
below
the
edge
of
his
skull
round
his
was
visible
through
the
skin
and
he
had
a
mouth
whose
corners
made
towards
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
slightest
provocation
he
walked
with
great
apparent
difficulty
back
into
the
room
anne
following
him
you
can
have
the
paper
if
you
want
it
but
you
never
give
me
much
time
to
see
what
in
en
here
the
paper
he
held
it
out
but
before
she
could
take
it
he
drew
it
back
again
saying
have
not
had
my
share
o
the
paper
by
a
good
deal
what
with
my
weak
sight
and
people
coming
so
soon
for
en
i
am
a
poor
soul
but
my
duty
of
man
will
be
left
to
me
when
the
newspaper
is
gone
and
he
sank
into
his
chair
with
an
air
of
exhaustion
anne
said
that
she
did
not
wish
to
take
the
paper
if
he
had
not
done
with
it
and
that
she
was
really
later
in
the
week
than
usual
owing
to
the
soldiers
yes
rot
the
soldiers
and
now
hedges
will
be
broke
and
hens
nests
robbed
and
stole
and
i
do
know
what
all
who
to
pay
sure
i
reckon
that
because
the
soldiers
be
come
you
do
mean
to
be
kind
enough
to
read
to
me
what
i
had
time
to
read
myself
she
would
read
if
he
wished
she
said
she
was
in
no
hurry
and
sitting
herself
down
she
unfolded
the
paper
dinner
at
carlton
house
faith
is
nothing
to
i
defence
of
the
country
may
read
that
if
ye
will
i
hope
there
will
be
no
billeting
in
this
parish
or
any
wild
work
of
that
sort
for
what
would
a
poor
old
lamiger
like
myself
do
with
soldiers
in
his
house
and
nothing
to
feed
with
anne
began
reading
and
continued
at
her
task
nearly
ten
minutes
when
she
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
in
the
quadrangular
slough
without
of
a
large
figure
in
the
uniform
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
do
you
see
out
there
said
the
farmer
with
a
start
as
she
paused
and
slowly
blushed
soldier
one
of
the
yeomanry
said
anne
not
quite
at
her
ease
it
all
is
my
nephew
exclaimed
the
old
man
his
face
turning
to
a
phosphoric
pallor
and
his
body
twitching
with
innumerable
alarms
as
he
formed
upon
his
face
a
gasping
smile
of
joy
with
which
to
welcome
the
relative
on
prithee
miss
garland
before
she
had
read
far
the
visitor
straddled
over
the
into
the
passage
and
entered
the
room
nunc
how
do
you
feel
said
the
giant
shaking
hands
with
the
farmer
in
the
manner
of
one
violently
ringing
a
to
see
you
and
weakish
festus
replied
the
other
his
person
responding
passively
to
the
rapid
vibrations
imparted
be
tender
please
a
little
softer
there
a
dear
nephew
my
arm
is
no
more
than
a
cobweb
poor
soul
i
am
not
much
more
than
a
skeleton
and
ca
bear
rough
usage
to
hear
that
but
i
bear
your
affliction
in
mind
why
you
are
all
in
a
tremble
uncle
benjy
because
i
am
so
gratified
said
the
old
man
always
get
all
in
a
tremble
when
i
am
taken
by
surprise
by
a
beloved
relation
that
it
said
the
yeoman
bringing
his
hand
down
on
the
back
of
his
uncle
chair
with
a
loud
smack
at
which
uncle
benjy
nervously
sprang
three
inches
from
his
seat
and
dropped
into
it
again
your
pardon
for
frightening
ye
uncle
is
how
we
do
in
the
army
and
i
forgot
your
nerves
you
have
scarcely
expected
to
see
me
i
dare
say
but
here
i
am
am
glad
to
see
ye
you
are
not
going
to
stay
long
perhaps
the
contrary
i
am
going
to
stay
ever
so
long
i
see
i
am
so
glad
dear
festus
ever
so
long
did
ye
say
so
long
said
the
young
gentleman
sitting
on
the
slope
of
the
bureau
and
stretching
out
his
legs
as
props
am
going
to
make
this
quite
my
own
home
whenever
i
am
off
duty
as
long
as
we
stay
out
and
after
that
when
the
campaign
is
over
in
the
autumn
i
shall
come
here
and
live
with
you
like
your
own
son
and
help
manage
your
land
and
your
farm
you
know
and
make
you
a
comfortable
old
man
how
you
do
please
me
said
the
farmer
with
a
horrified
smile
and
grasping
the
arms
of
his
chair
to
sustain
himself
i
have
been
meaning
to
come
a
long
time
as
i
knew
you
like
to
have
me
uncle
benjy
and
is
in
my
heart
to
refuse
you
always
was
kind
that
way
i
always
was
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
not
to
disappoint
you
that
i
sha
be
here
always
all
day
that
is
because
of
my
military
duties
as
a
cavalry
man
not
always
that
a
pity
exclaimed
the
farmer
with
a
cheerful
eye
knew
you
say
so
and
i
sha
be
able
to
sleep
here
at
night
sometimes
for
the
same
reason
sleep
here
o
nights
said
the
old
gentleman
still
more
relieved
ought
to
sleep
here
you
certainly
ought
in
short
you
must
but
you
ca
while
we
are
with
the
colours
but
directly
that
over
the
very
next
day
i
stay
here
all
day
and
all
night
too
to
oblige
you
since
you
ask
me
so
very
kindly
ye
that
will
be
very
nice
said
uncle
benjy
i
knew
relieve
ye
and
he
kindly
stroked
his
head
the
old
man
expressing
his
enjoyment
at
the
affectionate
token
by
a
grimace
should
have
called
to
see
you
the
other
night
when
i
passed
through
here
festus
continued
it
was
so
late
that
i
could
come
so
far
out
of
my
way
you
wo
think
it
unkind
at
all
if
you
i
never
shall
think
it
unkind
if
you
really
come
you
know
festy
there
was
a
few
minutes
pause
and
as
the
nephew
said
nothing
uncle
benjy
went
on
wish
i
had
a
little
present
for
ye
but
as
would
have
it
we
have
lost
a
deal
of
stock
this
year
and
i
have
had
to
pay
away
so
much
old
man
i
know
you
have
shall
i
lend
you
a
piece
uncle
benjy
ha
you
must
have
your
joke
well
i
think
o
that
and
so
they
expect
buonaparty
to
choose
this
very
part
of
the
coast
for
his
landing
hey
and
that
the
yeomanry
be
to
stand
in
front
as
the
forlorn
hope
says
so
asked
the
florid
son
of
mars
losing
a
little
redness
there
nothing
in
that
said
festus
bravely
thought
it
possible
at
one
time
but
they
do
know
festus
turned
himself
as
he
talked
and
now
said
abruptly
this
why
is
our
little
anne
he
had
not
noticed
her
till
this
moment
the
young
woman
having
at
his
entry
kept
her
face
over
the
newspaper
and
then
got
away
to
the
back
part
of
the
room
are
you
and
your
mother
always
going
to
stay
down
there
in
the
watching
the
little
fishes
miss
anne
she
said
that
it
was
uncertain
in
a
tone
of
truthful
precision
which
the
question
was
hardly
worth
looking
forcedly
at
him
as
she
spoke
but
she
blushed
fitfully
in
her
arms
and
hands
as
much
as
in
her
face
not
that
she
was
overpowered
by
the
great
boots
formidable
spurs
and
other
fierce
appliances
of
his
person
as
he
imagined
simply
she
had
not
been
prepared
to
meet
him
there
hope
you
will
i
am
sure
for
my
own
good
said
he
letting
his
eyes
linger
on
the
round
of
her
cheek
anne
became
a
little
more
dignified
and
her
look
showed
reserve
but
the
yeoman
on
perceiving
this
went
on
talking
to
her
in
so
civil
a
way
that
he
irresistibly
amused
her
though
she
tried
to
conceal
all
feeling
at
a
brighter
remark
of
his
than
usual
her
mouth
moved
her
upper
lip
playing
uncertainly
over
her
white
teeth
it
would
stay
still
no
it
would
withdraw
a
little
way
in
a
smile
then
it
would
flutter
down
again
and
so
it
wavered
like
a
butterfly
in
a
tender
desire
to
be
pleased
and
smiling
and
yet
to
be
also
sedate
and
composed
to
show
him
that
she
did
not
want
compliments
and
yet
that
she
was
not
so
cold
as
to
wish
to
repress
any
genuine
feeling
he
might
be
anxious
to
utter
you
want
any
more
reading
mr
derriman
said
she
interrupting
the
younger
man
in
his
remarks
not
i
go
homeward
let
me
hinder
you
longer
said
festus
off
in
a
minute
or
two
when
your
man
has
cleaned
my
boots
do
hinder
us
nephew
she
must
have
the
paper
is
the
day
for
her
to
have
she
might
read
a
little
more
as
i
have
had
so
little
profit
out
o
en
hitherto
well
why
do
ye
speak
will
ye
or
ye
my
dear
to
two
she
said
ho
damn
it
i
must
go
then
i
suppose
said
festus
laughing
and
unable
to
get
a
further
glance
from
her
he
left
the
room
and
clanked
into
the
back
yard
where
he
saw
a
man
holding
up
his
hand
he
cried
cripplestraw
cripplestraw
came
up
in
a
trot
moved
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
replaced
it
and
said
maister
derriman
he
was
old
derriman
odd
hand
in
the
yard
and
garden
and
like
his
employer
had
no
great
pretensions
to
manly
beauty
owing
to
a
limpness
of
backbone
and
speciality
of
mouth
which
opened
on
one
side
only
giving
him
a
triangular
smile
cripplestraw
how
is
it
said
festus
with
heartiness
considering
maister
derriman
and
how
yerself
well
now
see
and
clean
these
military
boots
of
mine
cock
my
foot
up
on
this
bench
this
pigsty
of
my
uncle
is
not
fit
for
a
soldier
to
come
into
maister
derriman
i
will
no
is
not
fit
maister
derriman
stock
has
uncle
lost
this
year
cripplestraw
let
see
sir
i
can
call
to
mind
that
we
lost
three
chickens
a
and
a
weakly
one
of
a
fare
of
ten
i
ca
think
of
no
more
maister
derriman
not
a
large
quantity
of
cattle
the
old
rascal
is
not
a
large
quantity
old
what
did
you
say
sir
nothing
he
within
there
festus
flung
his
forehead
in
the
direction
of
a
right
line
towards
the
inner
apartment
a
regular
sniche
one
hee
fie
fie
master
derriman
said
cripplestraw
shaking
his
head
in
delighted
censure
should
talk
so
and
an
officer
derriman
is
the
duty
of
all
cavalry
gentlemen
to
bear
in
mind
that
their
blood
is
a
knowed
thing
in
the
country
and
not
to
speak
ill
maister
he
is
i
own
he
is
a
little
is
the
nater
of
some
old
venerable
gentlemen
to
be
so
we
hope
he
treat
ye
well
in
yer
fortune
sir
he
will
do
people
talk
about
me
here
cripplestraw
asked
the
yeoman
as
the
other
continued
busy
with
his
boots
yes
sir
they
do
off
and
on
you
know
they
says
you
be
as
fine
a
piece
of
calvery
flesh
and
bones
as
was
ever
growed
on
in
short
all
owns
that
you
be
a
fine
fellow
sir
i
wish
i
was
no
more
afraid
of
the
french
than
you
be
but
being
in
the
locals
maister
derriman
i
assure
ye
i
dream
of
having
to
defend
my
country
every
night
and
i
do
like
the
dream
at
all
should
take
it
careless
cripplestraw
as
i
do
and
soon
come
natural
to
you
not
to
mind
it
at
all
well
a
fine
fellow
is
not
everything
you
know
o
no
there
as
good
as
i
in
the
army
and
even
better
they
say
that
when

this
summer

die
like
a
man
i
fall
sure
maister
derriman
poor
soul
o
thee
i
sha
forget
as
you
lie
mouldering
in
yer
soldier
grave
said
the
warrior
uneasily
makes
think
i
am
going
to
fall
sir
by
all
accounts
the
yeomanry
will
be
put
in
front
that
what
my
uncle
has
been
saying
and
by
all
accounts
is
true
and
naterelly
they
be
mowed
down
like
grass
and
you
among
poor
young
galliant
officer
here
cripplestraw
this
is
a
foolish
report
how
can
yeomanry
be
put
in
front
nobody
put
in
front
we
yeomanry
have
nothing
to
do
with
buonaparte
landing
we
shall
be
away
in
a
safe
place
guarding
the
possessions
and
jewels
now
can
you
see
cripplestraw
any
way
at
all
that
the
yeomanry
can
be
put
in
front
do
you
think

said
the
cheering
cripplestraw
i
know
a
great
warrior
like
you
is
only
too
glad
o
the
chance

a
great
thing
for
ye
death
and
glory
in
short
i
hope
from
my
heart
you
will
be
and
i
say
so
very
often
to
folk
in
fact
i
pray
at
night
cuss
you

need
pray
about
it
maister
derriman
i
wo
course
my
sword
will
do
its
duty
that
enough
and
now
be
off
with
ye
festus
gloomily
returned
to
his
uncle
room
and
found
that
anne
was
just
leaving
he
was
inclined
to
follow
her
at
once
but
as
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
for
doing
this
he
went
to
the
window
and
remained
tapping
his
fingers
against
the
shutter
while
she
crossed
the
yard
nephy
you
are
not
gone
yet
said
the
farmer
looking
dubiously
at
festus
from
under
one
eyelid
see
how
i
am
not
by
any
means
better
you
see
so
i
ca
entertain
as
well
as
i
would
ca
nunc
you
ca
i
do
think
you
are
worse
if
i
do
dash
my
wig
but
you
have
plenty
of
opportunities
to
make
me
welcome
when
you
are
better
if
you
are
not
so
brisk
inwardly
as
you
was
why
not
try
change
of
air
this
is
a
dull
damp
hole
festus
and
i
am
thinking
of
moving
where
to
said
festus
with
surprise
and
interest
into
the
garret
in
the
north
corner
there
is
no
fireplace
in
the
room
but
i
sha
want
that
poor
soul
o
me
not
moving
far
not
but
i
have
not
a
soul
belonging
to
me
within
ten
mile
and
you
know
very
well
that
i
could
afford
to
go
to
lodgings
that
i
had
to
pay
for
know
it
i
know
it
uncle
benjy
well
do
be
disturbed
i
come
and
manage
for
you
as
soon
as
ever
this
boney
alarm
is
over
but
when
a
man
country
calls
he
must
obey
if
he
is
a
man
splendid
spirit
said
uncle
benjy
with
much
admiration
on
the
surface
of
his
countenance
never
had
it
how
could
it
have
got
into
the
boy
my
mother
side
perhaps
so
well
take
care
of
yourself
nephy
said
the
farmer
waving
his
hand
impressively
care
in
these
warlike
times
your
spirit
may
carry
ye
into
the
arms
of
the
enemy
and
you
are
the
last
of
the
family
you
should
think
of
this
and
not
let
your
bravery
carry
ye
away
be
disturbed
uncle
i
control
myself
said
festus
betrayed
into
against
his
will
least
i
do
what
i
can
but
nature
will
out
sometimes
well
i
off
he
began
humming
camp
and
promising
to
come
again
soon
retired
with
assurance
each
yard
of
his
retreat
adding
private
joyousness
to
his
uncle
form
when
the
bulky
young
man
had
disappeared
through
the
porter
lodge
uncle
benjy
showed
preternatural
activity
for
one
in
his
invalid
state
jumping
up
quickly
without
his
stick
at
the
same
time
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
quite
silently
like
a
thirsty
frog
which
was
his
way
of
expressing
mirth
he
ran
upstairs
as
quick
as
an
old
squirrel
and
went
to
a
dormer
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
grounds
beyond
the
gate
and
the
footpath
that
stretched
across
them
to
the
village
yes
he
said
in
a
suppressed
scream
dancing
up
and
down
after
her
she
hit
en
for
there
appeared
upon
the
path
the
figure
of
anne
garland
and
hastening
on
at
some
little
distance
behind
her
the
swaggering
shape
of
festus
she
became
conscious
of
his
approach
and
moved
more
quickly
he
moved
more
quickly
still
and
overtook
her
she
turned
as
if
in
answer
to
a
call
from
him
and
he
walked
on
beside
her
till
they
were
out
of
sight
the
old
man
then
played
upon
an
imaginary
fiddle
for
about
half
a
minute
and
suddenly
discontinuing
these
signs
of
pleasure
went
downstairs
again
vii
how
they
talked
in
the
pastures
often
come
this
way
said
festus
to
anne
rather
before
he
had
overtaken
her
come
for
the
newspaper
and
other
things
she
said
perplexed
by
a
doubt
whether
he
were
there
by
accident
or
design
they
moved
on
in
silence
festus
beating
the
grass
with
his
switch
in
a
masterful
way
you
speak
anne
he
asked
said
anne
thousand
pardons
i
thought
you
did
now
do
let
me
drive
you
out
of
the
path
i
can
walk
among
the
high
grass
and
giltycups
they
will
not
yellow
my
stockings
as
they
will
yours
well
what
do
you
think
of
a
lot
of
soldiers
coming
to
the
neighbourhood
in
this
way
think
it
is
very
lively
and
a
great
change
she
said
with
demure
seriousness
you
do
like
us
warriors
as
a
body
anne
smiled
without
replying
you
are
laughing
said
the
yeoman
looking
searchingly
at
her
and
blushing
like
a
little
fire
do
you
see
to
laugh
at
i
laugh
said
anne
a
little
scared
at
his
sudden
mortification
yes
you
know
you
did
you
young
sneerer
he
said
like
a
cross
baby
are
laughing
at
me
that
who
you
are
laughing
at
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
would
do
without
such
as
me
if
the
french
were
to
drop
in
upon
ye
any
night
you
help
to
beat
them
off
said
she
you
ask
such
a
question
what
are
we
for
but
you
do
think
anything
of
soldiers
o
yes
she
liked
soldiers
she
said
especially
when
they
came
home
from
the
wars
covered
with
glory
though
when
she
thought
what
doings
had
won
them
that
glory
she
did
not
like
them
quite
so
well
the
gallant
and
appeased
yeoman
said
he
supposed
her
to
mean
chopping
off
heads
blowing
out
brains
and
that
kind
of
business
and
thought
it
quite
right
that
a
thing
like
her
should
feel
a
little
horrified
but
as
for
him
he
should
not
mind
such
another
blenheim
this
summer
as
the
army
had
fought
a
hundred
years
ago
or
whenever
it
was
dash
his
wig
if
he
should
mind
it
at
all
now
you
are
laughing
again
yes
i
saw
you
and
the
choleric
festus
turned
his
blue
eyes
and
flushed
face
upon
her
as
though
he
would
read
her
through
anne
strove
valiantly
to
look
calmly
back
but
her
eyes
could
not
face
his
and
they
fell
did
laugh
he
repeated
was
only
a
tiny
little
one
she
murmured
i
knew
you
did
thundered
he
what
was
it
you
laughed
at
only
thought
that
you
were
merely
in
the
yeomanry
she
murmured
slily
what
of
that
the
yeomanry
only
seem
farmers
that
have
lost
their
senses
yes
i
knew
you
meant
some
jeering
o
that
sort
mistress
anne
but
i
suppose
is
the
way
of
women
and
i
take
no
notice
i
confess
that
some
of
us
are
no
great
things
but
i
know
how
to
draw
a
sword
do
i
say
i
do
just
to
provoke
me
am
sure
you
do
said
anne
sweetly
a
frenchman
came
up
to
you
derriman
would
you
take
him
on
the
hip
or
on
the
thigh
you
are
flattering
he
said
his
white
teeth
uncovering
themselves
in
a
smile
of
course
i
should
draw
my
sword
no
i
mean
my
sword
would
be
already
drawn
and
i
should
put
spurs
to
my
horse
charger
as
we
call
it
in
the
army
and
i
should
ride
up
to
him
and
say
no
i
should
say
anything
of
course
men
never
waste
words
in
battle
i
should
take
him
with
the
third
guard
low
point
and
then
coming
back
to
the
second
guard
that
would
be
taking
care
of
yourself
not
hitting
at
him
can
you
say
that
he
cried
the
beams
upon
his
face
turning
to
a
lurid
cloud
in
a
moment
can
you
understand
military
terms
never
had
a
sword
in
your
life
i
should
take
him
with
the
sword
at
all
he
went
on
with
eager
sulkiness
should
take
him
with
my
pistol
i
should
pull
off
my
right
glove
and
throw
back
my
then
i
should
open
my
prime
and
cast
about
no
i
should
that
wrong
i
should
draw
my
right
pistol
and
as
soon
as
loaded
seize
the
weapon
by
the
butt
then
at
the
word
cock
your
pistol
i
should
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
give
such
words
of
command
in
the
heat
of
battle
said
anne
innocently
said
the
yeoman
his
face
again
in
flames
of
course
i
am
only
telling
you
what
be
the
word
of
command
there
now
you
la
did
my
word
i
did
i
do
think
you
did
it
was
my
mistake
well
then
i
come
smartly
to
present
looking
well
along
the
barrel
along
the
barrel
and
fire
of
course
i
know
well
enough
how
to
engage
the
enemy
but
i
expect
my
old
uncle
has
been
setting
you
against
me
has
not
said
a
word
replied
anne
i
have
heard
of
you
of
course
have
you
heard
nothing
good
i
dare
say
it
makes
my
blood
boil
within
me
nothing
bad
said
she
assuringly
a
word
now
and
then
come
tell
me
there
a
dear
i
do
like
to
be
crossed
it
shall
be
a
sacred
secret
between
us
come
now
anne
was
embarrassed
and
her
smile
was
uncomfortable
shall
not
tell
you
she
said
at
last
it
is
again
said
the
yeoman
throwing
himself
into
a
despair
shall
soon
begin
to
believe
that
my
name
is
not
worth
sixpence
about
here
tell
you
was
nothing
against
you
repeated
anne
means
it
might
have
been
for
me
said
festus
in
a
mollified
tone
though
to
speak
the
truth
i
have
a
good
many
faults
some
people
will
praise
me
i
suppose
was
praise
was
i
am
not
much
at
farming
and
i
am
not
much
in
company
and
i
am
not
much
at
figures
but
perhaps
i
must
own
since
it
is
forced
upon
me
that
i
can
show
as
fine
a
soldier
figure
on
the
esplanade
as
any
man
of
the
cavalry
can
said
anne
for
though
her
flesh
crept
in
mortal
terror
of
his
irascibility
she
could
not
resist
the
fearful
pleasure
of
leading
him
on
look
very
well
and
some
say
you
are
well
they
say
i
am
i
do
make
myself
so
is
no
praise
hullo
what
are
you
looking
across
there
for
at
a
bird
that
i
saw
fly
out
of
that
tree
said
anne
only
at
a
bird
do
you
say
he
heaved
out
in
a
voice
of
thunder
see
your
shoulders
young
madam
now
do
you
provoke
me
with
that
laughing
by
god
it
wo
do
go
away
said
anne
changed
from
mirthfulness
to
irritation
by
his
rough
manner
do
want
your
company
you
great
bragging
thing
you
are
so
touchy
there
no
bearing
with
you
go
away
no
anne
i
am
wrong
to
speak
to
you
so
i
give
you
free
liberty
to
say
what
you
will
to
me
say
i
am
not
a
bit
of
a
soldier
or
anything
abuse
me
do
now
there
a
dear
i
scum
i
froth
i
dirt
before
the
besom
yes
have
nothing
to
say
sir
stay
where
you
are
till
i
am
out
of
this
field
there
such
command
in
your
looks
that
i
heart
to
go
against
you
you
will
come
this
way
at
the
same
time
now
do
be
uncivil
she
was
too
generous
not
to
forgive
him
but
the
short
little
lip
murmured
that
she
did
not
think
it
at
all
likely
she
should
come
that
way
sunday
he
said
sunday
said
she
monday
tuesday
wednesday
surely
he
went
on
experimentally
she
answered
that
she
should
probably
not
see
him
on
either
day
and
cutting
short
the
argument
went
through
the
wicket
into
the
other
field
festus
paused
looking
after
her
and
when
he
could
no
longer
see
her
slight
figure
he
swept
away
his
deliberations
began
singing
and
turned
off
in
the
other
direction
viii
anne
makes
a
circuit
of
the
camp
when
anne
was
crossing
the
last
field
she
saw
approaching
her
an
old
woman
with
wrinkled
cheeks
who
surveyed
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
through
the
medium
of
spectacles
shaking
her
head
at
anne
till
the
glasses
shone
like
two
moons
she
said
ah
i
zeed
ye
if
i
had
only
kept
on
my
short
ones
that
i
use
for
reading
the
collect
and
gospel
i
should
have
zeed
ye
but
thinks
i
i
be
going
out
o
doors
and
i
put
on
my
long
ones
little
thinking
what
they
show
me
ay
i
can
tell
folk
at
any
distance
with
these
is
a
beautiful
pair
for
out
o
doors
though
my
short
ones
be
best
for
close
work
such
as
darning
and
catching
fleas
that
true
have
you
seen
granny
seamore
said
anne
fie
miss
nancy
you
know
said
granny
seamore
shaking
her
head
still
he
a
fine
young
feller
and
will
have
all
his
money
when
gone
anne
said
nothing
to
this
and
looking
ahead
with
a
smile
passed
granny
seamore
by
festus
the
subject
of
the
remark
was
at
this
time
about
a
fine
fellow
as
to
feet
and
inches
and
of
a
remarkably
warm
tone
in
skin
and
hair
symptoms
of
beard
and
whiskers
had
appeared
upon
him
at
a
very
early
age
owing
to
his
persistent
use
of
the
razor
before
there
was
any
necessity
for
its
operation
the
brave
boy
had
scraped
unseen
in
the
in
the
cellar
in
the
in
the
stable
in
the
unused
parlour
in
the
in
the
barn
and
wherever
he
could
set
up
his
triangular
bit
of
without
observation
or
extemporize
a
mirror
by
sticking
up
his
hat
on
the
outside
of
a
the
result
now
was
that
did
he
neglect
to
use
the
instrument
he
once
had
trifled
with
a
fine
rust
broke
out
upon
his
countenance
on
the
first
day
a
golden
lichen
on
the
second
and
a
fiery
stubble
on
the
third
to
a
degree
which
admitted
of
no
further
postponement
his
disposition
divided
naturally
into
two
the
boastful
and
the
cantankerous
when
festus
put
on
the
big
pot
as
it
is
classically
called
he
was
quite
blinded
ipso
facto
to
the
diverting
effect
of
that
mood
and
manner
upon
others
but
when
disposed
to
be
envious
or
quarrelsome
he
was
rather
shrewd
than
otherwise
and
could
do
some
pretty
strokes
of
satire
he
was
both
liked
and
abused
by
the
girls
who
knew
him
and
though
they
were
pleased
by
his
attentions
they
never
failed
to
ridicule
him
behind
his
back
in
his
cups
he
knew
those
vessels
though
only
he
first
became
noisy
then
excessively
friendly
and
then
invariably
nagging
during
childhood
he
had
made
himself
renowned
for
his
pleasant
habit
of
pouncing
down
upon
boys
smaller
and
poorer
than
himself
and
knocking
their
birds
nests
out
of
their
hands
or
overturning
their
little
carts
of
apples
or
pouring
water
down
their
backs
but
his
conduct
became
singularly
the
reverse
of
aggressive
the
moment
the
little
boys
mothers
ran
out
to
him
brandishing
brooms
skimmers
and
whatever
else
they
could
lay
hands
on
by
way
of
weapons
he
then
fled
and
hid
behind
bushes
under
faggots
or
in
pits
till
they
had
gone
away
and
on
one
such
occasion
was
known
to
creep
into
a
badger
hole
quite
out
of
sight
maintaining
that
post
with
great
firmness
and
resolution
for
two
or
three
hours
he
had
brought
more
vulgar
exclamations
upon
the
tongues
of
respectable
parents
in
his
native
parish
than
any
other
boy
of
his
time
when
other
youngsters
snowballed
him
he
ran
into
a
place
of
shelter
where
he
kneaded
snowballs
of
his
own
with
a
stone
inside
and
used
these
formidable
missiles
in
returning
their
pleasantry
sometimes
he
got
fearfully
beaten
by
boys
his
own
age
when
he
would
roar
most
lustily
but
fight
on
in
the
midst
of
his
tears
blood
and
cries
he
was
early
in
love
and
had
at
the
time
of
the
story
suffered
from
the
ravages
of
that
passion
thirteen
distinct
times
he
could
not
love
lightly
and
gaily
his
love
was
earnest
and
even
savage
it
was
a
positive
agony
to
him
to
be
ridiculed
by
the
object
of
his
affections
and
such
conduct
drove
him
into
a
frenzy
if
persisted
in
he
was
a
torment
to
those
who
behaved
humbly
towards
him
cynical
with
those
who
denied
his
superiority
and
a
very
nice
fellow
towards
those
who
had
the
courage
to
him
this
stalwart
gentleman
and
anne
garland
did
not
cross
each
other
paths
again
for
a
week
then
her
mother
began
as
before
about
the
newspaper
and
though
anne
did
not
much
like
the
errand
she
agreed
to
go
for
it
on
garland
pressing
her
with
unusual
anxiety
why
her
mother
was
so
persistent
on
so
small
a
matter
quite
puzzled
the
girl
but
she
put
on
her
hat
and
started
as
she
had
expected
festus
appeared
at
a
stile
over
which
she
sometimes
went
for
shortness
sake
and
showed
by
his
manner
that
he
awaited
her
when
she
saw
this
she
kept
straight
on
as
if
she
would
not
enter
the
park
at
all
this
is
your
way
said
festus
was
thinking
of
going
round
by
the
road
she
said
is
that
she
paused
as
if
she
were
not
inclined
to
say
go
that
way
when
the
grass
is
wet
she
returned
at
last
is
not
wet
now
he
persisted
sun
has
been
shining
on
it
these
nine
hours
the
fact
was
that
the
way
by
the
path
was
less
open
than
by
the
road
and
festus
wished
to
walk
with
her
uninterrupted
of
course
it
is
nothing
to
me
what
you
do
he
flung
himself
from
the
stile
and
walked
away
towards
the
house
anne
supposing
him
really
indifferent
took
the
same
way
upon
which
he
turned
his
head
and
waited
for
her
with
a
proud
smile
can
not
go
with
you
she
said
decisively
you
foolish
girl
i
must
walk
along
with
you
down
to
the
corner
please
derriman
we
might
be
seen
now
that
shyness
he
said
jocosely
you
know
i
can
not
let
you
i
must
i
do
not
allow
it
it
or
not
i
will
you
are
unkind
and
i
must
submit
she
said
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
ho
what
a
shame
of
me
my
wig
i
wo
do
any
such
thing
for
the
world
said
the
repentant
yeoman
haw
why
i
thought
your
go
away
meant
come
on
as
it
does
with
so
many
of
the
women
i
meet
especially
in
these
clothes
who
was
to
know
you
were
so
confoundedly
serious
as
he
did
not
go
anne
stood
still
and
said
nothing
see
you
have
a
deal
more
caution
and
a
deal
less
than
i
ever
thought
you
had
he
continued
emphatically
sir
it
is
not
any
planned
manner
of
mine
at
all
she
said
earnestly
you
will
see
i
am
sure
that
i
could
not
go
down
to
the
hall
with
you
without
putting
myself
in
a
wrong
light
that
it
that
it
i
am
only
a
fellow
in
the
yeomanry
cavalry
a
plain
soldier
i
may
say
and
we
know
what
women
think
of
such
that
they
are
a
bad
lot
men
you
must
speak
to
for
fear
of
losing
your
character
chaps
you
avoid
in
the
roads
chaps
that
come
into
a
house
like
oxen
daub
the
stairs
wi
their
boots
stain
the
furniture
wi
their
drink
talk
rubbish
to
the
servants
abuse
all
that
holy
and
righteous
and
are
only
saved
from
being
carried
off
by
old
nick
because
they
are
wanted
for
boney
i
did
know
you
were
thought
so
bad
of
as
that
said
she
simply
do
my
uncle
complain
to
you
of
me
you
are
a
favourite
of
that
handsome
nice
old
gaffer
i
know
what
do
we
think
of
our
nice
hey
anne
closed
her
mouth
up
tight
built
it
up
in
fact
to
show
that
no
answer
was
coming
to
that
question
now
come
seriously
loveday
is
a
good
fellow
and
so
is
his
father
do
know
a
close
little
rogue
you
are
there
is
no
getting
anything
out
of
you
i
believe
you
would
say
i
do
know
to
every
mortal
question
so
very
discreet
as
you
are
upon
my
heart
there
are
some
women
who
would
say
i
do
know
to
will
ye
marry
me
the
brightness
upon
anne
cheek
and
in
her
eyes
during
this
remark
showed
that
there
was
a
fair
quantity
of
life
and
warmth
beneath
the
discretion
he
complained
of
having
spoken
thus
he
drew
aside
that
she
might
pass
and
bowed
very
low
anne
formally
inclined
herself
and
went
on
she
had
been
at
vexation
point
all
the
time
that
he
was
present
from
a
haunting
sense
that
he
would
not
have
spoken
to
her
so
freely
had
she
been
a
young
woman
with
thriving
male
relatives
to
keep
forward
admirers
in
check
but
she
had
been
struck
now
as
at
their
previous
meeting
with
the
power
she
possessed
of
working
him
up
either
to
irritation
or
to
complacency
at
will
and
this
consciousness
of
being
able
to
play
upon
him
as
upon
an
instrument
disposed
her
to
a
humorous
considerateness
and
made
her
tolerate
even
while
she
rebuffed
him
when
anne
got
to
the
hall
the
farmer
as
usual
insisted
upon
her
reading
what
he
had
been
unable
to
get
through
and
held
the
paper
tightly
in
his
skinny
hand
till
she
had
agreed
he
sent
her
to
a
hard
chair
that
she
could
not
possibly
injure
to
the
extent
of
a
pennyworth
by
sitting
in
it
a
twelvemonth
and
watched
her
from
the
outer
angle
of
his
near
eye
while
she
bent
over
the
paper
his
look
might
have
been
suggested
by
the
sight
that
he
had
witnessed
from
his
window
on
the
last
occasion
of
her
visit
for
it
partook
of
the
nature
of
concern
the
old
man
was
afraid
of
his
nephew
physically
and
morally
and
he
began
to
regard
anne
as
a
sufferer
under
the
same
despot
after
this
sly
and
curious
gaze
at
her
he
withdrew
his
eye
again
so
that
when
she
casually
lifted
her
own
there
was
nothing
visible
but
his
keen
bluish
profile
as
before
when
the
reading
was
about
through
the
door
behind
them
opened
and
footsteps
crossed
the
threshold
the
farmer
diminished
perceptibly
in
his
chair
and
looked
fearful
but
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
the
reading
and
quite
unconscious
of
an
intruder
anne
felt
the
presence
of
the
swashing
festus
and
stopped
her
reading
go
on
miss
anne
he
said
am
not
going
to
speak
a
word
he
withdrew
to
the
mantelpiece
and
leaned
against
it
at
his
ease
on
do
ye
maidy
anne
said
uncle
benjy
keeping
down
his
tremblings
by
a
great
effort
to
half
their
natural
extent
anne
voice
became
much
lower
now
that
there
were
two
listeners
and
her
modesty
shrank
somewhat
from
exposing
to
festus
the
appreciative
modulations
which
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
subject
drew
from
her
when
unembarrassed
but
she
still
went
on
that
he
might
not
suppose
her
to
be
disconcerted
though
the
ensuing
ten
minutes
was
one
of
disquietude
she
knew
that
the
bothering
yeoman
eyes
were
travelling
over
her
from
his
position
behind
creeping
over
her
shoulders
up
to
her
head
and
across
her
arms
and
hands
old
benjy
on
his
part
knew
the
same
thing
and
after
sundry
endeavours
to
peep
at
his
nephew
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
could
bear
the
situation
no
longer
ye
want
to
say
anything
to
me
nephew
he
quaked
uncle
thank
ye
said
festus
heartily
like
to
stay
here
thinking
of
you
and
looking
at
your
back
hair
the
nervous
old
man
writhed
under
this
vivisection
and
anne
read
on
till
to
the
relief
of
both
the
gallant
fellow
grew
tired
of
his
amusement
and
went
out
of
the
room
anne
soon
finished
her
paragraph
and
rose
to
go
determined
never
to
come
again
as
long
as
festus
haunted
the
precincts
her
face
grew
warmer
as
she
thought
that
he
would
be
sure
to
waylay
her
on
her
journey
home
on
this
account
when
she
left
the
house
instead
of
going
in
the
customary
direction
she
bolted
round
to
the
further
side
through
the
bushes
along
under
the
wall
and
through
a
door
leading
into
a
rutted
which
had
been
a
pleasant
gravelled
drive
when
the
fine
old
hall
was
in
its
prosperity
once
out
of
sight
of
the
windows
she
ran
with
all
her
might
till
she
had
quitted
the
park
by
a
route
directly
opposite
to
that
towards
her
home
why
she
was
so
seriously
bent
upon
doing
this
she
could
hardly
tell
but
the
instinct
to
run
was
irresistible
it
was
necessary
now
to
clamber
over
the
down
to
the
left
of
the
camp
and
make
a
complete
circuit
round
the
latter
infantry
cavalry
sutlers
and
all
descending
to
her
house
on
the
other
side
this
tremendous
walk
she
performed
at
a
rapid
rate
never
once
turning
her
head
and
avoiding
every
beaten
track
to
keep
clear
of
the
knots
of
soldiers
taking
a
walk
when
she
at
last
got
down
to
the
levels
again
she
paused
to
fetch
breath
and
murmured
did
i
take
so
much
trouble
he
would
not
after
all
have
hurt
me
as
she
neared
the
mill
an
erect
figure
with
a
blue
body
and
white
thighs
descended
before
her
from
the
down
towards
the
village
and
went
past
the
mill
to
a
stile
beyond
over
which
she
usually
returned
to
her
house
here
he
lingered
on
coming
nearer
anne
discovered
this
person
to
be
loveday
and
not
wishing
to
meet
anybody
just
now
anne
passed
quickly
on
and
entered
the
house
by
the
garden
door
dear
anne
what
a
time
you
have
been
gone
said
her
mother
i
have
been
round
by
another
road
did
you
do
that
anne
looked
thoughtful
and
reticent
for
her
reason
was
almost
too
silly
a
one
to
confess
i
wanted
to
avoid
a
person
who
is
very
busy
trying
to
meet
me
that
all
she
said
her
mother
glanced
out
of
the
window
there
he
is
i
suppose
she
said
as
john
loveday
tired
of
looking
for
anne
at
the
stile
passed
the
house
on
his
way
to
his
father
door
he
could
not
help
casting
his
eyes
towards
their
window
and
seeing
them
he
smiled
anne
reluctance
to
mention
festus
was
such
that
she
did
not
correct
her
mother
error
and
the
dame
went
on
you
are
quite
right
my
dear
be
friendly
with
him
but
no
more
at
present
i
have
heard
of
your
other
affair
and
think
it
is
a
very
wise
choice
i
am
sure
you
have
my
best
wishes
in
it
and
i
only
hope
it
will
come
to
a
point
that
said
the
astonished
anne
and
festus
derriman
dear
you
need
not
mind
me
i
have
known
it
for
several
days
old
granny
seamore
called
here
saturday
and
told
me
she
saw
him
coming
home
with
you
across
park
close
last
week
when
you
went
for
the
newspaper
so
i
thought
i
send
you
again
and
give
you
another
chance
you
did
want
the
paper
and
it
was
only
for
that
a
very
fine
young
fellow
he
looks
a
thorough
woman
protector
may
look
it
said
anne
has
given
up
the
freehold
farm
his
father
held
at
pitstock
and
lives
in
independence
on
what
the
land
brings
him
and
when
farmer
derriman
dies
he
have
all
the
old
man
for
certain
he
be
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
if
a
penny
in
money
besides
sixteen
horses
cart
and
hack
a
dairy
and
at
least
five
hundred
sheep
anne
turned
away
and
instead
of
informing
her
mother
that
she
had
been
running
like
a
doe
to
escape
the
interesting
alluded
to
merely
said
i
do
like
this
at
all
ix
anne
is
kindly
fetched
by
the
after
this
anne
would
on
no
account
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
for
fear
of
another
encounter
with
young
derriman
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
it
was
told
in
the
village
that
the
old
farmer
had
actually
gone
for
a
week
holiday
and
change
of
air
to
the
royal
near
at
hand
at
the
instance
of
his
nephew
festus
this
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
hear
of
uncle
benjy
who
had
not
slept
outside
the
walls
of
oxwell
hall
for
many
a
long
year
before
and
anne
well
imagined
what
extraordinary
pressure
must
have
been
put
upon
him
to
induce
him
to
take
such
a
step
she
pictured
his
unhappiness
at
the
bustling
and
hoped
no
harm
would
come
to
him
she
spent
much
of
her
time
indoors
or
in
the
garden
hearing
little
of
the
camp
movements
beyond
the
periodical
of
the
trumpeters
sounding
their
various
ingenious
calls
for
stables
feed
parade
and
so
on
which
made
her
think
how
clever
her
friend
the
must
be
to
teach
his
pupils
to
play
those
pretty
little
tunes
so
well
on
the
third
morning
after
uncle
benjy
departure
she
was
disturbed
as
usual
while
dressing
by
the
tramp
of
the
troops
down
the
slope
to
the
and
during
the
now
familiar
stamping
and
splashing
which
followed
there
sounded
upon
the
glass
of
the
window
a
slight
smack
which
might
have
been
caused
by
a
whip
or
switch
she
listened
more
particularly
and
it
was
repeated
as
john
loveday
was
the
only
dragoon
likely
to
be
aware
that
she
slept
in
that
particular
apartment
she
imagined
the
signal
to
come
from
him
though
wondering
that
he
should
venture
upon
such
a
freak
of
familiarity
wrapping
herself
up
in
a
red
cloak
she
went
to
the
window
gently
drew
up
a
corner
of
the
curtain
and
peeped
out
as
she
had
done
many
times
before
nobody
who
was
not
quite
close
beneath
her
window
could
see
her
face
but
as
it
happened
somebody
was
close
the
soldiers
whose
floundering
anne
had
heard
were
not
loveday
dragoons
but
a
troop
of
the
york
hussars
quite
oblivious
of
her
existence
they
had
passed
on
out
of
the
water
and
instead
of
them
there
sat
festus
derriman
alone
on
his
horse
and
in
plain
clothes
the
water
reaching
up
to
the
belly
and
festus
heels
elevated
over
the
saddle
to
keep
them
out
of
the
stream
which
threatened
to
wash
rider
and
horse
into
the
deep
just
below
it
was
plainly
he
who
had
struck
her
lattice
for
in
a
moment
he
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
festus
laughed
loudly
and
slapped
her
window
again
and
just
at
that
moment
the
dragoons
began
prancing
down
the
slope
in
review
order
she
could
not
but
wait
a
minute
or
two
to
see
them
pass
while
doing
so
she
was
suddenly
led
to
draw
back
drop
the
corner
of
the
curtain
and
blush
privately
in
her
room
she
had
not
only
been
seen
by
festus
derriman
but
by
john
loveday
who
riding
along
with
his
trumpet
slung
up
behind
him
had
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
phenomenon
of
derriman
beneath
anne
bedroom
window
and
seemed
quite
astounded
at
the
sight
she
was
quite
vexed
at
the
conjunction
of
incidents
and
went
no
more
to
the
window
till
the
dragoons
had
ridden
far
away
and
she
had
heard
festus
horse
laboriously
wade
on
to
dry
land
when
she
looked
out
there
was
nobody
left
but
miller
loveday
who
usually
stood
in
the
garden
at
this
time
of
the
morning
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
the
soldiers
of
whom
he
already
knew
so
many
and
was
in
a
fair
way
of
knowing
many
more
from
the
liberality
with
which
he
handed
round
mugs
of
cheering
liquor
whenever
parties
of
them
walked
that
way
in
the
afternoon
of
this
day
anne
walked
to
a
christening
party
at
a
neighbour
in
the
adjoining
parish
of
springham
intending
to
walk
home
again
before
it
got
dark
but
there
was
a
slight
fall
of
rain
towards
evening
and
she
was
pressed
by
the
people
of
the
house
to
stay
over
the
night
with
some
hesitation
she
accepted
their
hospitality
but
at
ten
when
they
were
thinking
of
going
to
bed
they
were
startled
by
a
smart
rap
at
the
door
and
on
it
being
unbolted
a
man
form
was
seen
in
the
shadows
outside
miss
garland
here
the
visitor
inquired
at
which
anne
suspended
her
breath
said
anne
entertainer
warily
mother
is
very
anxious
to
know
what
become
of
her
she
promised
to
come
home
to
her
great
relief
anne
recognized
the
voice
as
john
loveday
and
not
festus
derriman
i
did
loveday
said
she
coming
forward
it
rained
and
i
thought
my
mother
would
guess
where
i
was
loveday
said
with
diffidence
that
it
had
not
rained
anything
to
speak
of
at
the
camp
or
at
the
mill
so
that
her
mother
was
rather
alarmed
she
asked
you
to
come
for
me
anne
inquired
this
was
a
question
which
the
had
been
dreading
during
the
whole
of
his
walk
thither
she
did
exactly
ask
me
he
said
rather
lamely
but
still
in
a
manner
to
show
that
garland
had
indirectly
signified
such
to
be
her
wish
in
reality
garland
had
not
addressed
him
at
all
on
the
subject
she
had
merely
spoken
to
his
father
on
finding
that
her
daughter
did
not
return
and
received
an
assurance
from
the
miller
that
the
precious
girl
was
doubtless
quite
safe
john
heard
of
this
inquiry
and
having
a
pass
that
evening
resolved
to
relieve
garland
mind
on
his
own
responsibility
ever
since
his
morning
view
of
festus
under
her
window
he
had
been
on
thorns
of
anxiety
and
his
thrilling
hope
now
was
that
she
would
walk
back
with
him
he
shifted
his
foot
nervously
as
he
made
the
bold
request
anne
felt
at
once
that
she
would
go
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
whose
care
she
would
more
readily
be
under
than
the
in
a
case
like
the
present
he
was
their
nearest
neighbour
son
and
she
had
liked
his
ingenuousness
from
the
first
moment
of
his
return
home
when
they
had
started
on
their
walk
anne
said
in
a
practical
way
to
show
that
there
was
no
sentiment
whatever
in
her
acceptance
of
his
company
was
much
alarmed
about
me
perhaps
she
was
uneasy
he
said
and
then
was
compelled
by
conscience
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
know
she
was
uneasy
because
my
father
said
so
but
i
did
not
see
her
myself
the
truth
is
she
does
know
i
am
come
anne
now
saw
how
the
matter
stood
but
she
was
not
offended
with
him
what
woman
could
have
been
they
walked
on
in
silence
the
respectful
keeping
a
yard
off
on
her
right
as
precisely
as
if
that
measure
had
been
fixed
between
them
she
had
a
great
feeling
of
civility
toward
him
this
evening
and
spoke
again
often
hear
your
trumpeters
blowing
the
calls
they
do
it
beautifully
i
think
fair
they
might
do
better
said
he
as
one
too
to
make
much
of
an
accomplishment
in
which
he
had
a
hand
you
taught
them
how
to
do
it
i
taught
them
must
require
wonderful
practice
to
get
them
into
the
way
of
beginning
and
finishing
so
exactly
at
one
time
it
is
like
one
throat
doing
it
all
how
came
you
to
be
a
trumpeter
mr
loveday
i
took
to
it
naturally
when
i
was
a
little
boy
said
he
betrayed
into
quite
a
gushing
state
by
her
delightful
interest
used
to
make
trumpets
of
paper
eldersticks
eltrot
stems
and
even
stalks
you
know
then
father
set
me
to
keep
the
birds
off
that
little
of
his
and
gave
me
an
old
horn
to
frighten
with
i
learnt
to
blow
that
horn
so
that
you
could
hear
me
for
miles
and
miles
then
he
bought
me
a
clarionet
and
when
i
could
play
that
i
borrowed
a
serpent
and
i
learned
to
play
a
tolerable
bass
so
when
i
i
was
picked
out
for
training
as
trumpeter
at
once
course
you
were
however
i
wish
i
had
never
joined
the
army
my
father
gave
me
a
very
fair
education
and
your
father
showed
me
how
to
draw
horses
on
a
slate
i
mean
yes
i
ought
to
have
done
more
than
i
have
did
you
know
my
father
she
asked
with
new
interest
yes
for
years
you
were
a
little
mite
of
a
thing
then
and
you
used
to
cry
when
we
big
boys
looked
at
you
and
made
pig
eyes
at
you
which
we
did
sometimes
many
and
many
a
time
have
i
stood
by
your
poor
father
while
he
worked
ah
you
do
remember
much
about
him
but
i
do
anne
remained
thoughtful
and
the
moon
broke
from
behind
the
clouds
lighting
up
the
wet
foliage
with
a
twinkling
brightness
and
lending
to
each
of
the
buttons
and
spurs
a
little
ray
of
its
own
they
had
come
to
oxwell
park
gate
and
he
said
you
like
going
across
or
round
by
the
lane
may
as
well
go
by
the
nearest
road
said
anne
they
entered
the
park
following
the
drive
till
they
came
almost
opposite
the
hall
when
they
entered
a
footpath
leading
on
to
the
village
while
hereabout
they
heard
a
shout
or
chorus
of
exclamation
apparently
from
within
the
walls
of
the
dark
buildings
near
them
was
that
said
anne
do
know
said
her
companion
go
and
see
he
went
round
the
intervening
swamp
of
watercress
and
brooklime
which
had
once
been
the
crossed
by
a
culvert
the
trickling
brook
that
still
flowed
that
way
and
advanced
to
the
wall
of
the
house
boisterous
noises
were
resounding
from
within
and
he
was
tempted
to
go
round
the
corner
where
the
low
windows
were
and
look
through
a
chink
into
the
room
whence
the
sounds
proceeded
it
was
the
room
in
which
the
owner
dined
traditionally
called
the
great
parlour
and
within
it
sat
about
a
dozen
young
men
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
one
of
them
being
festus
they
were
drinking
laughing
singing
thumping
their
fists
on
the
tables
and
enjoying
themselves
in
the
very
perfection
of
confusion
the
candles
blown
by
the
breeze
from
the
partly
opened
window
had
guttered
into
coffin
handles
and
shrouds
and
choked
by
their
long
black
wicks
for
want
of
snuffing
gave
out
a
smoky
yellow
light
one
of
the
young
men
might
possibly
have
been
in
a
maudlin
state
for
he
had
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
his
next
neighbour
another
was
making
an
incoherent
speech
to
which
nobody
was
listening
some
of
their
faces
were
red
some
were
sallow
some
were
sleepy
some
wide
awake
the
only
one
among
them
who
appeared
in
his
usual
frame
of
mind
was
festus
whose
huge
burly
form
rose
at
the
head
of
the
table
enjoying
with
a
serene
and
triumphant
aspect
the
difference
between
his
own
condition
and
that
of
his
neighbours
while
the
looked
a
young
woman
niece
of
anthony
cripplestraw
and
one
of
uncle
benjy
servants
was
called
in
by
one
of
the
crew
and
much
against
her
will
a
fiddle
was
placed
in
her
hands
from
which
they
made
her
produce
discordant
screeches
the
absence
of
uncle
benjy
had
in
fact
been
contrived
by
young
derriman
that
he
might
make
use
of
the
hall
on
his
own
account
cripplestraw
had
been
left
in
charge
and
festus
had
found
no
difficulty
in
forcing
from
that
dependent
the
keys
of
whatever
he
required
john
loveday
turned
his
eyes
from
the
scene
to
the
neighbouring
moonlit
path
where
anne
still
stood
waiting
then
he
looked
into
the
room
then
at
anne
again
it
was
an
opportunity
of
advancing
his
own
cause
with
her
by
exposing
festus
for
whom
he
began
to
entertain
hostile
feelings
of
no
mean
force
i
ca
do
it
he
said
underhand
let
things
take
their
chance
he
moved
away
and
then
perceived
that
anne
tired
of
waiting
had
crossed
the
stream
and
almost
come
up
with
him
is
the
noise
about
she
said
company
in
the
house
said
loveday
farmer
derriman
is
not
at
home
said
anne
and
went
on
to
the
window
whence
the
rays
of
light
leaked
out
the
standing
where
he
was
he
saw
her
face
enter
the
beam
of
candlelight
stay
there
for
a
moment
and
quickly
withdraw
she
came
back
to
him
at
once
us
go
on
she
said
loveday
imagined
from
her
tone
that
she
must
have
an
interest
in
derriman
and
said
sadly
blame
me
for
going
across
to
the
window
and
leading
you
to
follow
me
a
bit
said
anne
seeing
his
mistake
as
to
the
state
of
her
heart
and
being
rather
angry
with
him
for
it
think
it
was
most
natural
considering
the
noise
silence
again
is
sober
as
a
judge
said
loveday
as
they
turned
to
go
was
only
the
others
who
were
noisy
he
is
sober
or
not
is
nothing
whatever
to
me
said
anne
course
not
i
know
it
said
the
in
accents
expressing
unhappiness
at
her
somewhat
curt
tone
and
some
doubt
of
her
assurance
before
they
had
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
hall
some
persons
were
seen
moving
along
the
road
loveday
was
for
going
on
just
the
same
but
anne
from
a
shy
feeling
that
it
was
as
well
not
to
be
seen
walking
alone
with
a
man
who
was
not
her
lover
said
loveday
let
us
wait
here
a
minute
till
they
have
passed
on
nearer
view
the
group
was
seen
to
comprise
a
man
on
a
piebald
horse
and
another
man
walking
beside
him
when
they
were
opposite
the
house
they
halted
and
the
rider
dismounted
whereupon
a
dispute
between
him
and
the
other
man
ensued
apparently
on
a
question
of
money
old
derriman
come
home
said
anne
has
hired
that
horse
from
the
to
bring
him
only
fancy
before
they
had
gone
many
steps
further
the
farmer
and
his
companion
had
ended
their
dispute
and
the
latter
mounted
the
horse
and
cantered
away
uncle
benjy
coming
on
to
the
house
at
a
nimble
pace
as
soon
as
he
observed
loveday
and
anne
he
fell
into
a
feebler
gait
when
they
came
up
he
recognized
anne
you
have
torn
yourself
away
from
king
george
esplanade
so
soon
farmer
derriman
said
she
faith
i
could
bide
at
such
a
ruination
place
said
the
farmer
hand
in
your
pocket
every
minute
of
the
day
is
a
shilling
for
this
for
that
if
you
only
eat
one
egg
or
even
a
poor
windfall
of
an
apple
you
got
to
pay
and
a
bunch
radishes
is
a
halfpenny
and
a
quart
o
cider
a
good
tuppence
at
lowest
reckoning
nothing
without
paying
i
even
get
a
ride
homeward
upon
that
screw
without
the
man
wanting
a
shilling
for
it
when
my
weight
did
take
a
penny
out
of
the
beast
i
saved
a
or
so
of
shoeleather
to
be
sure
but
the
saddle
was
so
rough
wi
patches
that
took
twopence
out
of
the
seat
of
my
best
breeches
king
george
hev
ruined
the
town
for
other
folks
more
than
that
my
nephew
promised
to
come
there
to
see
me
and
if
i
had
stayed
i
must
have
treated
en
hey
what
that
it
was
a
shout
from
within
the
walls
of
the
building
and
loveday
said
nephew
is
here
and
has
company
nephew
gasped
the
old
man

come
up
to
the
door
with
me
i
mean
hee
hee
just
for
company
dear
me
i
thought
my
house
was
as
quiet
as
a
church
they
went
back
to
the
window
and
the
farmer
looked
in
his
mouth
falling
apart
to
a
greater
width
at
the
corners
than
in
the
middle
and
his
fingers
assuming
a
state
of
radiation
my
best
silver
tankards
they
got
that
i
never
used
o
is
my
strong
beer
is
eight
candles
guttering
away
when
i
used
nothing
but
twenties
myself
for
the
last

was
here
then
said
loveday
no

the
farmer
shaking
his
head
known
to
poor
i
there
my
best
rummers
jingling
as
careless
as
if
was
tin
cups
and
my
table
scratched
and
my
chairs
wrenched
out
of
joint
see
how
they
tilt
on
the
two
back
legs
and
that
ruin
to
a
chair
ah
when
i
be

another
old
man
to
make
such
work
with
and
provide
goods
for
his
breaking
and
and
drink
for
his
brass
set
and
said
festus

the
hot

a
fate
that

happen
to
the
greatest
men

name
said
one
of
the
warriors
whose
head
occasionally
drooped
upon
his
epaulettes
and
whose
eyes
fell
together
in
the
casual
manner
characteristic
of
the
tired
soldier
it
was
really

that

trees
said
uncle
benjy
want
to
spite
wait
a
few
minutes
just
to
see
if
he
gets
in
said
the
major
to
anne
as
they
retired
from
the
old
man
want
to
get
home
said
anne
anxiously
when
they
had
quite
receded
behind
the
and
he
stood
alone
uncle
benjy
to
their
surprise
set
up
a
loud
shout
altogether
beyond
the
imagined
power
of
his
lungs
man
he
cried
repeating
the
exclamation
several
times
and
then
ran
and
hid
himself
behind
a
corner
of
the
building
soon
the
door
opened
and
festus
and
his
guests
came
tumbling
out
upon
the
green
our
duty
to
help
folks
in
distress
said
festus
where
are
you
across
there
said
one
of
his
friends
was
here
said
another
meanwhile
uncle
benjy
coming
from
his
had
scampered
with
the
quickness
of
a
boy
up
to
the
door
they
had
quitted
and
slipped
in
in
a
moment
the
door
flew
together
and
anne
heard
him
bolting
and
barring
it
inside
the
revellers
however
did
not
notice
this
and
came
on
towards
the
spot
where
the
and
anne
were
standing
succour
at
hand
friends
said
festus
are
all
king
men
do
not
fear
us
you
said
loveday
are
we
he
explained
in
two
words
that
they
were
not
the
distressed
traveller
who
had
cried
out
and
turned
to
go
on
she
my
life
is
she
said
festus
now
first
recognizing
anne
anne
i
will
not
part
from
you
till
i
see
you
safe
at
your
own
dear
door
in
my
hands
said
loveday
civilly
though
not
without
firmness
it
is
not
required
thank
you
had
i
but
my
sword
said
loveday
do
want
to
quarrel
let
put
it
to
her
whichever
of
us
she
likes
best
he
shall
take
her
home
miss
anne
which
anne
would
much
rather
have
gone
home
alone
but
seeing
the
remainder
of
the
yeomanry
party
staggering
up
she
thought
it
best
to
secure
a
protector
of
some
kind
how
to
choose
one
without
offending
the
other
and
provoking
a
quarrel
was
the
difficulty
must
both
walk
home
with
me
she
adroitly
said
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
and
if
you
are
not
quite
civil
to
one
another
all
the
time
i
never
speak
to
either
of
you
again
they
agreed
to
the
terms
and
the
other
yeomen
arriving
at
this
time
said
they
would
go
also
as
rearguard
well
said
anne
go
and
get
your
hats
and
do
be
long
yes
our
hats
said
the
yeomanry
whose
heads
were
so
hot
that
they
had
forgotten
their
nakedness
till
then
wait
till
we
got
we
wo
be
a
moment
said
festus
eagerly
anne
and
loveday
said
yes
and
festus
ran
back
to
the
house
followed
by
all
his
band
let
run
and
leave
said
anne
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
we
promised
to
wait
said
the
in
surprise
to
wait
said
anne
indignantly
if
one
ought
to
keep
such
a
promise
to
drunken
men
as
that
you
can
do
as
you
like
i
shall
go
is
hardly
fair
to
leave
the
chaps
said
loveday
reluctantly
and
looking
back
at
them
but
she
heard
no
more
and
flitting
off
under
the
trees
was
soon
lost
to
his
sight
festus
and
the
rest
had
by
this
time
reached
uncle
benjy
door
which
they
were
discomfited
and
astonished
to
find
closed
they
began
to
knock
and
then
to
kick
at
the
venerable
timber
till
the
old
man
head
crowned
with
a
tasselled
nightcap
appeared
at
an
upper
window
followed
by
his
shoulders
with
apparently
nothing
on
but
his
shirt
though
it
was
in
truth
a
sheet
thrown
over
his
coat
fie
upon
ye
all
for
making
such
a
hullaballoo
at
a
weak
old
door
he
said
yawning
in
ye
to
rouse
honest
folks
at
this
time
o
night
me
why
it
uncle
benjy
haw
haw
haw
said
festus
why
how
the
devil
this
is
i
festus
wanting
to
come
in

no
my
clever
man
whoever
you

said
uncle
benjy
in
a
tone
of
incredulous
integrity
nephew
dear
boy

miles
away
at
quarters
and
sound
asleep
by
this
time
as
becomes
a
good
soldier
that
story
wo

my
man
not
at
all
my

in

said
the
coming
up

my
friend
guard
her
from
all
harm
good
speech
and
i
will
too
said
loveday
heartily
now
for
shelter
said
festus
to
his
companions
they
then
unceremoniously
left
loveday
without
wishing
him
and
proceeded
towards
the
barn
he
crossed
the
park
and
ascended
the
down
to
the
camp
grieved
that
he
had
given
anne
cause
of
complaint
and
fancying
that
she
held
him
of
slight
account
beside
his
wealthier
rival
x
the
virtues
of
a
double
garden
anne
was
so
flurried
by
the
military
incidents
attending
her
return
home
that
she
was
almost
afraid
to
venture
alone
outside
her
premises
moreover
the
numerous
soldiers
regular
and
otherwise
that
haunted
overcombe
and
its
neighbourhood
were
getting
better
acquainted
with
the
villagers
and
the
result
was
that
they
were
always
standing
at
garden
gates
walking
in
the
orchards
or
sitting
gossiping
just
within
cottage
doors
with
the
bowls
of
their
thrust
outside
for
politeness
sake
that
they
might
not
defile
the
air
of
the
household
being
gentlemen
of
a
gallant
and
most
affectionate
nature
they
naturally
turned
their
heads
and
smiled
if
a
pretty
girl
passed
by
which
was
rather
disconcerting
to
the
latter
if
she
were
unused
to
society
every
belle
in
the
village
soon
had
a
lover
and
when
the
belles
were
all
allotted
those
who
scarcely
deserved
that
title
had
their
turn
many
of
the
soldiers
being
not
at
all
particular
about
of
nose
more
or
less
a
trifling
deficiency
of
teeth
or
a
larger
crop
of
freckles
than
is
customary
in
the
saxon
race
thus
with
one
and
another
courtship
began
to
be
practised
in
overcombe
on
rather
a
large
scale
and
the
dispossessed
young
men
who
had
been
born
in
the
place
were
left
to
take
their
walks
alone
where
instead
of
studying
the
works
of
nature
they
meditated
gross
outrages
on
the
brave
men
who
had
been
so
good
as
to
visit
their
village
anne
watched
these
romantic
proceedings
from
her
window
with
much
interest
and
when
she
saw
how
triumphantly
other
handsome
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
walked
by
on
the
gorgeous
arms
of
lieutenant
knockheelmann
cornet
flitzenhart
and
captain
klaspenkissen
of
the
thrilling
york
hussars
who
swore
the
most
picturesque
foreign
oaths
and
had
a
wonderful
sort
of
estate
or
property
called
the
vaterland
in
their
country
across
the
sea
she
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
her
own
loneliness
it
made
her
think
of
things
which
she
tried
to
forget
and
to
look
into
a
little
drawer
at
something
soft
and
brown
that
lay
in
a
curl
there
wrapped
in
paper
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
went
downstairs
are
you
going
said
garland
see
the
folks
because
i
am
so
gloomy
not
at
present
anne
not
mother
said
anne
blushing
with
an
indefinite
sense
of
being
very
wicked
you
must
not
i
have
been
going
to
tell
you
several
times
not
to
go
into
the
street
at
this
time
of
day
why
not
walk
in
the
morning
there
young
derriman
would
be
glad
to
mention
him
mother
do
then
dear
walk
in
the
garden
so
poor
anne
who
really
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
throw
her
heart
away
upon
a
soldier
but
merely
wanted
to
displace
old
thoughts
by
new
turned
into
the
inner
garden
from
day
to
day
and
passed
a
good
many
hours
there
the
pleasant
birds
singing
to
her
and
the
delightful
butterflies
alighting
on
her
hat
and
the
horrid
ants
running
up
her
stockings
this
garden
was
undivided
from
loveday
the
two
having
originally
been
the
single
garden
of
the
whole
house
it
was
a
quaint
old
place
enclosed
by
a
thorn
hedge
so
shapely
and
dense
from
incessant
clipping
that
the
could
walk
along
the
top
without
sinking
in
a
feat
which
he
often
performed
as
a
means
of
filling
out
his
day
work
the
soil
within
was
of
that
intense
fat
blackness
which
is
only
seen
after
a
century
of
constant
cultivation
the
paths
were
grassed
over
so
that
people
came
and
went
upon
them
without
being
heard
the
grass
harboured
slugs
and
on
this
account
the
miller
was
going
to
replace
it
by
gravel
as
soon
as
he
had
time
but
as
he
had
said
this
for
thirty
years
without
doing
it
the
grass
and
the
slugs
seemed
likely
to
remain
the
miller
man
attended
to
garland
piece
of
the
garden
as
well
as
to
the
larger
portion
digging
planting
and
weeding
indifferently
in
both
the
miller
observing
with
reason
that
it
was
not
worth
while
for
a
helpless
widow
lady
to
hire
a
man
for
her
little
plot
when
his
man
working
alongside
could
tend
it
without
much
addition
to
his
labour
the
two
households
were
on
this
account
even
more
closely
united
in
the
garden
than
within
the
mill
out
there
they
were
almost
one
family
and
they
talked
from
plot
to
plot
with
a
zest
and
animation
which
garland
could
never
have
anticipated
when
she
first
removed
thither
after
her
husband
death
the
lower
half
of
the
garden
farthest
from
the
road
was
the
most
snug
and
sheltered
part
of
this
snug
and
sheltered
enclosure
and
it
was
well
watered
as
the
land
of
lot
three
small
brooks
about
a
yard
wide
ran
with
a
tinkling
sound
from
side
to
side
between
the
plots
crossing
the
path
under
wood
slabs
laid
as
bridges
and
passing
out
of
the
garden
through
little
tunnels
in
the
hedge
the
brooks
were
so
far
overhung
at
their
brinks
by
grass
and
garden
produce
that
had
it
not
been
for
their
perpetual
babbling
few
would
have
noticed
that
they
were
there
this
was
where
anne
liked
best
to
linger
when
her
excursions
became
restricted
to
her
own
premises
and
in
a
spot
of
the
garden
not
far
removed
the
loved
to
linger
also
having
by
virtue
of
his
office
no
stable
duty
to
perform
he
came
down
from
the
camp
to
the
mill
almost
every
day
and
anne
finding
that
he
adroitly
walked
and
sat
in
his
father
portion
of
the
garden
whenever
she
did
so
in
the
other
half
could
not
help
smiling
and
speaking
to
him
so
his
epaulettes
and
blue
jacket
and
anne
yellow
gipsy
hat
were
often
seen
in
different
parts
of
the
garden
at
the
same
time
but
he
never
intruded
into
her
part
of
the
enclosure
nor
did
she
into
loveday
she
always
spoke
to
him
when
she
saw
him
there
and
he
replied
in
deep
firm
accents
across
the
gooseberry
bushes
or
through
the
tall
rows
of
flowering
peas
as
the
case
might
be
he
thus
gave
her
accounts
at
fifteen
paces
of
his
experiences
in
camp
in
quarters
in
flanders
and
elsewhere
of
the
difference
between
line
and
column
of
forced
marches
billeting
and
together
with
his
hopes
of
promotion
anne
listened
at
first
indifferently
but
knowing
no
one
else
so
and
experienced
she
grew
interested
in
him
as
in
a
brother
by
degrees
his
gold
lace
buckles
and
spurs
lost
all
their
strangeness
and
were
as
familiar
to
her
as
her
own
clothes
at
last
garland
noticed
this
growing
friendship
and
began
to
despair
of
her
motherly
scheme
of
uniting
anne
to
the
moneyed
festus
why
she
could
not
take
prompt
steps
to
check
interference
with
her
plans
arose
partly
from
her
nature
which
was
the
reverse
of
managing
and
partly
from
a
new
emotional
circumstance
with
which
she
found
it
difficult
to
reckon
the
near
neighbourhood
that
had
produced
the
friendship
of
anne
for
john
loveday
was
slowly
effecting
a
warmer
liking
between
her
mother
and
his
father
thus
the
month
of
july
passed
the
troop
horses
came
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
twice
a
day
down
to
drink
under
her
window
and
as
the
weather
grew
hotter
kicked
up
their
heels
and
shook
their
heads
furiously
under
the
maddening
sting
of
the
the
green
leaves
in
the
garden
became
of
a
darker
dye
the
gooseberries
ripened
and
the
three
brooks
were
reduced
to
half
their
winter
volume
at
length
the
earnest
obtained
garland
consent
to
take
her
and
her
daughter
to
the
camp
which
they
had
not
yet
viewed
from
any
closer
point
than
their
own
windows
so
one
afternoon
they
went
the
miller
being
one
of
the
party
the
villagers
were
by
this
time
driving
a
roaring
trade
with
the
soldiers
who
purchased
of
them
every
description
of
garden
produce
milk
butter
and
eggs
at
liberal
prices
the
figures
of
these
rural
sutlers
could
be
seen
creeping
up
the
slopes
laden
like
bees
to
a
spot
in
the
rear
of
the
camp
where
there
was
a
kind
of
place
on
the
greensward
garland
anne
and
the
miller
were
conducted
from
one
place
to
another
and
on
to
the
quarter
where
the
soldiers
wives
lived
who
had
not
been
able
to
get
lodgings
in
the
cottages
near
the
most
sheltered
place
had
been
chosen
for
them
and
snug
huts
had
been
built
for
their
use
by
their
husbands
of
clods
hurdles
a
little
thatch
or
whatever
they
could
lay
hands
on
the
conducted
his
friends
thence
to
the
large
barn
which
had
been
appropriated
as
a
hospital
and
to
the
cottage
with
its
windows
bricked
up
that
was
used
as
the
magazine
then
they
inspected
the
lines
of
shining
dark
horses
each
representing
the
then
high
figure
of
guineas
purchase
money
standing
patiently
at
the
ropes
which
stretched
from
one
to
another
a
bank
being
thrown
up
in
front
of
them
as
a
protection
at
night
they
passed
on
to
the
tents
of
the
german
legion
a
and
rather
dandy
set
of
men
with
a
poetical
look
about
their
faces
which
rendered
them
interesting
to
feminine
eyes
hanoverians
saxons
prussians
swedes
hungarians
and
other
foreigners
were
numbered
in
their
ranks
they
were
cleaning
arms
which
they
leant
carefully
against
a
rail
when
the
work
was
complete
on
their
return
they
passed
the
a
temporary
wooden
building
with
a
brick
chimney
as
anne
and
her
companions
went
by
a
group
of
three
or
four
of
the
hussars
were
standing
at
the
door
talking
to
a
dashing
young
man
who
was
expatiating
on
the
qualities
of
a
horse
that
one
was
inclined
to
buy
anne
recognized
festus
derriman
in
the
seller
and
cripplestraw
was
trotting
the
animal
up
and
down
as
soon
as
she
caught
the
yeoman
eye
he
came
forward
making
some
friendly
remark
to
the
miller
and
then
turning
to
miss
garland
who
kept
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
distant
landscape
till
he
got
so
near
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
longer
festus
looked
from
anne
to
the
and
from
the
back
to
anne
with
a
dark
expression
of
face
as
if
he
suspected
that
there
might
be
a
tender
understanding
between
them
you
offended
with
me
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
of
repressed
resentment
said
anne
are
you
coming
to
the
hall
again
perhaps
anne
said
garland
who
had
come
near
and
smiled
pleasantly
on
festus
can
go
at
any
time
as
usual
her
come
with
me
now
garland
i
should
be
pleased
to
walk
along
with
her
my
man
can
lead
home
the
horse
you
but
i
shall
not
come
said
miss
anne
coldly
the
widow
looked
unhappily
in
her
daughter
face
distressed
between
her
desire
that
anne
should
encourage
festus
and
her
wish
to
consult
own
feelings
her
alone
leave
her
alone
said
festus
his
gaze
blackening
i
think
of
it
i
am
glad
she
ca
come
with
me
for
i
am
engaged
and
he
stalked
away
anne
moved
on
with
her
mother
young
loveday
silently
following
and
they
began
to
descend
the
hill
where
mr
loveday
asked
garland
behind
said
john
garland
looked
behind
her
solicitously
and
the
miller
who
had
been
waiting
for
the
event
beckoned
to
her
overtake
you
in
a
minute
she
said
to
the
younger
pair
and
went
back
her
colour
for
some
unaccountable
reason
rising
as
she
did
so
the
miller
and
she
then
came
on
slowly
together
conversing
in
very
low
tones
and
when
they
got
to
the
bottom
they
stood
still
loveday
and
anne
waited
for
them
saying
but
little
to
each
other
for
the
rencounter
with
festus
had
damped
the
spirits
of
both
at
last
the
widow
private
talk
with
miller
loveday
came
to
an
end
and
she
hastened
onward
the
miller
going
in
another
direction
to
meet
a
man
on
business
when
she
reached
the
and
anne
she
was
looking
very
bright
and
rather
flurried
and
seemed
sorry
when
loveday
said
that
he
must
leave
them
and
return
to
the
camp
they
parted
in
their
usual
friendly
manner
and
anne
and
her
mother
were
left
to
walk
the
few
remaining
yards
alone
i
settled
it
said
garland
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
have
settled
in
my
mind
that
it
is
all
right
all
right
said
anne
you
do
not
care
for
derriman
and
mean
to
encourage
john
loveday
what
all
the
world
so
long
as
folks
are
happy
child
do
take
any
notice
of
what
i
have
said
about
festus
and
do
meet
him
any
more
a
weathercock
you
are
mother
why
should
you
say
that
just
now
is
easy
to
call
me
a
weathercock
said
the
matron
putting
on
the
look
of
a
good
woman
i
have
reasoned
it
out
and
at
last
thank
god
i
have
got
over
my
ambition
the
lovedays
are
our
true
and
only
friends
and
festus
derriman
with
all
his
money
is
nothing
to
us
at
all
said
anne
has
made
you
change
all
of
a
sudden
from
what
you
have
said
before
feelings
and
my
reason
which
i
am
thankful
for
anne
knew
that
her
mother
sentiments
were
naturally
so
versatile
that
they
could
not
be
depended
on
for
two
days
together
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
for
the
moment
that
a
change
had
been
helped
on
in
the
present
case
by
a
romantic
talk
between
garland
and
the
miller
but
garland
could
not
keep
the
secret
long
she
chatted
gaily
as
she
walked
and
before
they
had
entered
the
house
she
said
do
you
think
mr
loveday
has
been
saying
to
me
dear
anne
anne
did
not
know
at
all
he
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
xi
our
people
are
affected
by
the
presence
of
royalty
to
explain
the
miller
sudden
proposal
it
is
only
necessary
to
go
back
to
that
moment
when
anne
festus
and
garland
were
talking
together
on
the
down
john
loveday
had
fallen
behind
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
a
meeting
in
which
he
was
decidedly
superfluous
and
his
father
who
guessed
the
secret
watched
his
face
as
he
stood
face
was
sad
and
his
eyes
followed
garland
encouraging
manner
to
festus
in
a
way
which
plainly
said
that
every
parting
of
her
lips
was
tribulation
to
him
the
miller
loved
his
son
as
much
as
any
miller
or
private
gentleman
could
do
and
he
was
pained
to
see
john
gloom
at
such
a
trivial
circumstance
so
what
did
he
resolve
but
to
help
john
there
and
then
by
precipitating
a
matter
which
had
he
himself
been
the
only
person
concerned
he
would
have
delayed
for
another
six
months
he
had
long
liked
the
society
of
his
impulsive
tractable
neighbour
garland
had
mentally
taken
her
up
and
pondered
her
in
connexion
with
the
question
whether
it
would
not
be
for
the
happiness
of
both
if
she
were
to
share
his
home
even
though
she
was
a
little
his
superior
in
antecedents
and
knowledge
in
fact
he
loved
her
not
tragically
but
to
a
very
creditable
extent
for
his
years
that
is
next
to
his
sons
bob
and
john
though
he
knew
very
well
of
that
appearance
near
the
corners
of
her
once
handsome
eyes
and
that
the
little
depression
in
her
right
cheek
was
not
the
lingering
dimple
it
was
poetically
assumed
to
be
but
a
result
of
the
abstraction
of
some
nether
millstones
within
the
cheek
by
rootle
the
budmouth
man
who
lived
by
such
practices
on
the
heads
of
the
elderly
but
what
of
that
when
he
had
lost
two
to
each
one
of
hers
and
exceeded
her
in
age
by
some
eight
years
to
do
john
a
service
then
he
quickened
his
designs
and
put
the
question
to
her
while
they
were
standing
under
the
eyes
of
the
younger
pair
garland
though
she
had
been
interested
in
the
miller
for
a
long
time
and
had
for
a
moment
now
and
then
thought
on
this
question
as
far
as
he
should
he
were
to
and
so
on
had
never
thought
much
further
and
she
was
really
taken
by
surprise
when
the
question
came
she
answered
without
affectation
that
she
would
think
over
the
proposal
and
thus
they
parted
her
mother
infirmity
of
purpose
set
anne
thinking
and
she
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
conviction
that
in
such
a
case
she
ought
to
have
some
purpose
herself
garland
complacency
at
the
miller
offer
had
in
truth
amazed
her
while
her
mother
had
held
up
her
head
and
recommended
festus
it
had
seemed
a
very
pretty
thing
to
rebel
but
the
pressure
being
removed
an
awful
sense
of
her
own
responsibility
took
possession
of
her
mind
as
there
was
no
longer
anybody
to
be
wise
or
ambitious
for
her
surely
she
should
be
wise
and
ambitious
for
herself
discountenance
her
mother
attachment
and
encourage
festus
in
his
addresses
for
her
own
and
her
mother
good
there
had
been
a
time
when
a
loveday
thrilled
her
own
heart
but
that
was
long
ago
before
she
had
thought
of
position
or
differences
to
wake
into
cold
daylight
like
this
when
and
because
her
mother
had
gone
into
the
land
of
romance
was
dreadful
and
new
to
her
and
like
an
increase
of
years
without
living
them
but
it
was
easier
to
think
that
she
ought
to
marry
the
yeoman
than
to
take
steps
for
doing
it
and
she
went
on
living
just
as
before
only
with
a
little
more
thoughtfulness
in
her
eyes
two
days
after
the
visit
to
the
camp
when
she
was
again
in
the
garden
soldier
loveday
said
to
her
at
a
distance
of
five
rows
of
beans
and
a
have
heard
the
news
miss
garland
said
anne
without
looking
up
from
a
book
she
was
reading
king
is
coming
king
she
looked
up
then
to
gloucester
lodge
and
he
will
pass
this
way
he
ca
arrive
till
long
past
the
middle
of
the
night
if
what
they
say
is
true
that
he
is
timed
to
change
horses
at
woodyates
inn
between
mid
and
south
wessex
at
twelve
continued
loveday
encouraged
by
her
interest
to
cut
off
the
from
the
distance
between
them
miller
loveday
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
ye
heard
about
the
king
coming
miss
maidy
anne
he
said
anne
said
that
she
had
just
heard
of
it
and
the
who
hardly
welcomed
his
father
at
such
a
moment
explained
what
he
knew
of
the
matter
you
will
go
with
your
regiment
to
meet
i
suppose
said
old
loveday
young
loveday
said
that
the
men
of
the
german
legion
were
to
perform
that
duty
and
turning
half
from
his
father
and
half
towards
anne
he
added
in
a
tentative
tone
that
he
thought
he
might
get
leave
for
the
night
if
anybody
would
like
to
be
taken
to
the
top
of
the
ridgeway
over
which
the
royal
party
must
pass
anne
knowing
by
this
time
of
the
budding
hope
in
the
gallant
mind
and
not
wishing
to
encourage
it
said
do
want
to
go
the
miller
looked
disappointed
as
well
as
john
mother
might
like
to
i
am
going
indoors
and
i
ask
her
if
you
wish
me
to
said
she
she
went
indoors
and
rather
coldly
told
her
mother
of
the
proposal
garland
though
she
had
determined
not
to
answer
the
miller
question
on
matrimony
just
yet
was
quite
ready
for
this
jaunt
and
in
spite
of
anne
she
sailed
off
at
once
to
the
garden
to
hear
more
about
it
when
she
entered
she
said
i
have
not
seen
the
king
or
the
king
horses
for
these
many
years
and
i
am
going
it
is
well
to
be
you
mother
said
anne
in
an
elderly
tone
you
wo
come
with
us
said
garland
rather
rebuffed
have
very
different
things
to
think
of
said
her
daughter
with
virtuous
emphasis
going
to
see
sights
at
that
time
of
night
garland
was
sorry
but
resolved
to
adhere
to
the
arrangement
the
night
came
on
and
it
having
gone
abroad
that
the
king
would
pass
by
the
road
many
of
the
villagers
went
out
to
see
the
procession
when
the
two
lovedays
and
garland
were
gone
anne
bolted
the
door
for
security
and
sat
down
to
think
again
on
her
grave
responsibilities
in
the
choice
of
a
husband
now
that
her
natural
guardian
could
no
longer
be
trusted
a
knock
came
to
the
door
anne
instinct
was
at
once
to
be
silent
that
the
comer
might
think
the
family
had
retired
the
knocking
person
however
was
not
to
be
easily
persuaded
he
had
in
fact
seen
rays
of
light
over
the
top
of
the
shutter
and
unable
to
get
an
answer
went
on
to
the
door
of
the
mill
which
was
still
going
the
miller
sometimes
grinding
all
night
when
busy
the
grinder
accompanied
the
stranger
to
garland
door
daughter
is
certainly
at
home
sir
said
the
grinder
go
round
to
side
and
see
if
she
there
master
derriman
want
to
take
her
out
to
see
the
king
said
festus
anne
had
started
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
no
opportunity
could
have
been
better
for
carrying
out
her
new
convictions
on
the
disposal
of
her
hand
but
in
her
mortal
dislike
of
festus
anne
forgot
her
principles
and
her
idea
of
keeping
herself
above
the
lovedays
tossing
on
her
hat
and
blowing
out
the
candle
she
slipped
out
at
the
back
door
and
hastily
followed
in
the
direction
that
her
mother
and
the
rest
had
taken
she
overtook
them
as
they
were
beginning
to
climb
the
hill
you
have
altered
your
mind
after
all
said
the
widow
came
you
to
do
that
my
dear
thought
i
might
as
well
come
said
anne
be
sure
you
did
said
the
miller
heartily
good
deal
better
than
biding
at
home
there
john
said
nothing
though
she
could
almost
see
through
the
gloom
how
glad
he
was
that
she
had
altered
her
mind
when
they
reached
the
ridge
over
which
the
highway
stretched
they
found
many
of
their
neighbours
who
had
got
there
before
them
idling
on
the
grass
border
between
the
roadway
and
the
hedge
enjoying
a
sort
of
midnight
picnic
which
it
was
easy
to
do
the
air
being
still
and
dry
some
carriages
were
also
standing
near
though
most
people
of
the
district
who
possessed
four
wheels
or
even
two
had
driven
into
the
town
to
await
the
king
there
from
this
height
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
the
position
of
the
an
additional
number
of
lanterns
lamps
and
candles
having
been
lighted
night
by
the
loyal
burghers
to
grace
the
royal
entry
if
it
should
occur
before
dawn
garland
touched
anne
elbow
several
times
as
they
walked
and
the
young
woman
at
last
understood
that
this
was
meant
as
a
hint
to
her
to
take
the
arm
which
its
owner
was
rather
suggesting
than
offering
to
her
anne
wondered
what
infatuation
was
possessing
her
mother
declined
to
take
the
arm
and
contrived
to
get
in
front
with
the
miller
who
mostly
kept
in
the
van
to
guide
the
others
footsteps
the
was
left
with
garland
and
anne
encouraging
pursuit
of
them
induced
him
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
former
your
leave
i
speak
to
you
on
something
that
concerns
my
mind
very
much
indeed
is
my
wish
to
be
allowed
to
pay
my
addresses
to
your
daughter
thought
you
meant
that
said
garland
simply
you
not
object
shall
leave
it
to
her
i
do
think
she
will
agree
even
if
i
do
the
soldier
sighed
and
seemed
helpless
i
can
but
ask
her
he
said
the
spot
on
which
they
had
finally
chosen
to
wait
for
the
king
was
by
a
field
gate
whence
the
white
road
could
be
seen
for
a
long
distance
northwards
by
day
and
some
little
distance
now
they
lingered
and
lingered
but
no
king
came
to
break
the
silence
of
that
beautiful
summer
night
as
after
glided
by
and
nobody
came
anne
began
to
get
weary
she
knew
why
her
mother
did
not
propose
to
go
back
and
regretted
the
reason
she
would
have
proposed
it
herself
but
that
garland
seemed
so
cheerful
and
as
wide
awake
as
at
noonday
so
that
it
was
almost
a
cruelty
to
disturb
her
the
at
last
made
up
his
mind
and
tried
to
draw
anne
into
a
private
conversation
the
feeling
which
a
week
ago
had
been
a
vague
and
piquant
aspiration
was
altogether
too
lively
for
the
reasoning
of
this
soldier
to
regulate
so
he
persevered
in
his
intention
to
catch
her
alone
and
at
last
in
spite
of
her
manoeuvres
to
the
contrary
he
succeeded
the
miller
and
garland
had
walked
about
fifty
yards
further
on
and
anne
and
himself
were
left
standing
by
the
gate
but
the
gallant
musician
soul
was
so
much
disturbed
by
tender
vibrations
and
by
the
sense
of
his
presumption
that
he
could
not
begin
and
it
may
be
questioned
if
he
would
ever
have
broached
the
subject
at
all
had
not
a
distant
church
clock
opportunely
assisted
him
by
striking
the
hour
of
three
the
heaved
a
breath
of
relief
clock
strikes
in
g
sharp
he
said
g
sharp
said
anne
civilly
is
a
bell
i
used
to
notice
that
note
when
i
was
a
boy
you
the
very
same
and
since
then
i
had
a
wager
about
that
bell
with
the
bandmaster
of
the
north
wessex
militia
he
said
the
note
was
g
i
said
it
was
when
we
found
it
g
sharp
we
did
know
how
to
settle
it
is
not
a
deep
note
for
a
clock
no
the
finest
tenor
bell
about
here
is
the
bell
of
peter
casterbridge
in
e
flat
that
the
note
the
sounded
from
far
down
his
throat
what
he
considered
to
be
e
flat
with
a
parenthetic
sense
of
luxury
unquenchable
even
by
his
present
distraction
we
go
on
to
where
my
mother
is
said
anne
less
impressed
by
the
beauty
of
the
note
than
the
himself
was
one
minute
he
said
tremulously
of
music
i
fear
you
do
think
the
rank
of
a
much
to
compare
with
your
own
do
i
think
a
a
very
respectable
man
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
it
is
given
out
by
the
king
command
that
are
to
be
considered
respectable
then
i
am
by
chance
more
loyal
than
i
thought
for
get
a
good
deal
a
year
extra
to
the
trumpeters
because
of
my
position
very
nice
i
am
not
supposed
ever
to
drink
with
the
trumpeters
who
serve
beneath
me
by
the
orders
of
the
war
office
i
am
to
exert
over
them
the
government
word
exert
over
them
full
authority
and
if
any
one
behaves
towards
me
with
the
least
impropriety
or
neglects
my
orders
he
is
to
be
confined
and
reported
is
really
a
dignified
post
she
said
with
however
a
reserve
of
enthusiasm
which
was
not
altogether
encouraging
of
course
some
day
i
shall
stammered
the
dragoon
be
in
rather
a
better
position
than
i
am
at
present
am
glad
to
hear
it
mr
loveday
in
short
mistress
anne
continued
john
loveday
bravely
and
desperately
i
pay
court
to
you
in
the
hope
that
no
no
do
go
away
you
have
heard
yet
that
you
may
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
not
yet
but
when
peace
is
proclaimed
and
all
is
smooth
and
easy
again
i
ca
put
it
any
better
though
there
more
to
be
explained
is
most
awkward
said
anne
evidently
with
pain
can
not
possibly
agree
believe
me
loveday
i
can
not
there
more
than
this
you
would
be
surprised
to
see
what
snug
rooms
the
married
and
have
in
quarters
are
not
all
consider
camp
and
war
brings
me
to
my
strong
point
exclaimed
the
soldier
hopefully
father
is
better
off
than
most
officers
fathers
and
there
always
a
home
for
you
at
his
house
in
any
emergency
i
can
tell
you
privately
that
he
has
enough
to
keep
us
both
and
if
you
hear
of
barracks
well
peace
once
established
i
live
at
home
as
a
miller
and
farmer
next
door
to
your
own
mother
mother
would
be
sure
to
object
expostulated
anne
she
leaves
it
all
to
you
you
have
asked
her
said
anne
with
surprise
i
thought
it
would
not
be
honourable
to
act
otherwise
very
good
of
you
said
anne
her
face
warming
with
a
generous
sense
of
his
straightforwardness
my
mother
is
so
entirely
ignorant
of
a
soldier
life
and
the
life
of
a
soldier
wife
she
is
so
simple
in
all
such
matters
that
i
can
not
listen
to
you
any
more
readily
for
what
she
may
say
it
is
all
over
for
me
said
the
poor
wiping
his
face
and
putting
away
his
handkerchief
with
an
air
of
finality
anne
was
silent
any
woman
who
has
ever
tried
will
know
without
explanation
what
an
unpalatable
task
it
is
to
dismiss
even
when
she
does
not
love
him
a
man
who
has
all
the
natural
and
moral
qualities
she
would
desire
and
only
fails
in
the
social
lovers
are
not
so
numerous
even
with
the
best
women
that
the
sacrifice
of
one
can
be
felt
as
other
than
a
good
thing
wasted
in
a
world
where
there
are
few
good
things
are
not
angry
miss
garland
said
he
finding
that
she
did
not
speak
no
do
let
us
say
anything
more
about
this
now
and
she
moved
on
when
she
drew
near
to
the
miller
and
her
mother
she
perceived
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
conversation
of
that
peculiar
kind
which
is
all
the
more
full
and
communicative
from
the
fact
of
definitive
words
being
few
in
short
here
the
game
was
succeeding
which
with
herself
had
failed
it
was
pretty
clear
from
the
symptoms
marks
tokens
telegraphs
and
general
byplay
between
widower
and
widow
that
miller
loveday
must
have
again
said
to
garland
some
such
thing
as
he
had
said
before
with
what
result
this
time
she
did
not
know
as
the
situation
was
delicate
anne
halted
awhile
apart
from
them
the
quite
ignorant
of
how
his
cause
was
entered
into
by
the
man
in
the
distance
for
his
father
had
not
yet
told
him
of
his
designs
upon
garland
did
not
advance
but
stood
still
by
the
gate
as
though
he
were
attending
a
princess
waiting
till
he
should
be
called
up
thus
they
lingered
and
the
day
began
to
break
garland
and
the
miller
took
no
heed
of
the
time
and
what
it
was
bringing
to
earth
and
sky
so
occupied
were
they
with
themselves
but
anne
in
her
place
and
the
in
his
each
in
private
thought
of
no
bright
kind
watched
the
gradual
glory
of
the
east
through
all
its
tones
and
changes
the
world
of
birds
and
insects
got
lively
the
blue
and
the
yellow
and
the
gold
of
loveday
uniform
again
became
distinct
the
sun
bored
its
way
upward
the
fields
the
trees
and
the
distant
landscape
kindled
to
flame
and
the
backed
by
a
lilac
shadow
as
tall
as
a
steeple
blazed
in
the
rays
like
a
very
god
of
war
it
was
three
a
short
time
after
a
rattle
of
horses
and
wheels
reached
their
ears
from
the
quarter
in
which
they
gazed
and
there
appeared
upon
the
white
line
of
road
a
moving
mass
which
presently
ascended
the
hill
and
drew
near
then
there
arose
a
huzza
from
the
few
knots
of
watchers
gathered
there
and
they
cried
live
king
jarge
the
cortege
passed
abreast
it
consisted
of
three
escorted
by
a
detachment
of
the
german
legion
anne
was
told
to
look
in
the
first
carriage
a
drawn
by
four
horses
for
the
king
and
queen
and
was
rewarded
by
seeing
a
profile
reminding
her
of
the
current
coin
of
the
realm
but
as
the
party
had
been
travelling
all
night
and
the
spectators
here
gathered
were
few
none
of
the
royal
family
looked
out
of
the
carriage
windows
it
was
said
that
the
two
elder
princesses
were
in
the
same
carriage
but
they
remained
invisible
the
next
vehicle
a
coach
and
four
contained
more
princesses
and
the
third
some
of
their
attendants
god
i
have
seen
my
king
said
garland
when
they
had
all
gone
by
nobody
else
expressed
any
thankfulness
for
most
of
them
had
expected
a
more
pompous
procession
than
the
bucolic
tastes
of
the
king
cared
to
indulge
in
and
one
old
man
said
grimly
that
that
sight
of
dusty
old
leather
coaches
was
not
worth
waiting
for
anne
looked
hither
and
thither
in
the
bright
rays
of
the
day
each
of
her
eyes
having
a
little
sun
in
it
which
gave
her
glance
a
peculiar
golden
fire
and
kindled
the
brown
curls
grouped
over
her
forehead
to
a
yellow
brilliancy
and
made
single
hairs
blown
astray
by
the
night
look
like
lacquered
wires
she
was
wondering
if
festus
were
anywhere
near
but
she
could
not
see
him
before
they
left
the
ridge
they
turned
their
attention
towards
the
royal
which
was
visible
at
this
place
only
as
a
portion
of
the
from
which
the
was
rolling
slowly
back
the
sea
beyond
was
still
wrapped
in
summer
fog
the
ships
in
the
roads
showing
through
it
as
black
spiders
suspended
in
the
air
while
they
looked
and
walked
a
white
jet
of
smoke
burst
from
a
spot
which
the
miller
knew
to
be
the
battery
in
front
of
the
king
residence
and
then
the
report
of
guns
reached
their
ears
this
announcement
was
answered
by
a
salute
from
the
castle
of
the
adjoining
isle
and
the
ships
in
the
neighbouring
anchorage
all
the
bells
in
the
town
began
ringing
the
king
and
his
family
had
arrived
xii
how
everybody
great
and
small
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
downs
as
the
days
went
on
echoes
of
the
life
and
bustle
of
the
town
reached
the
ears
of
the
quiet
people
in
overcombe
hollow
exciting
and
moving
those
unimportant
natives
as
a
moves
the
weeds
in
a
cave
of
all
kinds
and
colours
climbed
and
descended
the
road
that
led
towards
the
seaside
borough
some
contained
those
personages
of
the
king
suite
who
had
not
kept
pace
with
him
in
his
journey
from
windsor
others
were
the
coaches
of
aristocracy
big
and
little
whom
news
of
the
king
arrival
drew
thither
for
their
own
pleasure
so
that
the
highway
as
seen
from
the
hills
about
overcombe
appeared
like
an
a
constant
succession
of
dark
spots
creeping
along
its
surface
at
nearly
uniform
rates
of
progress
and
all
in
one
direction
the
traffic
and
intelligence
between
camp
and
town
passed
in
a
measure
over
the
villagers
heads
it
being
summer
time
the
miller
was
much
occupied
with
business
and
the
was
too
constantly
engaged
in
marching
between
the
camp
and
gloucester
lodge
with
the
rest
of
the
dragoons
to
bring
his
friends
any
news
for
some
days
at
last
he
sent
a
message
that
there
was
to
be
a
review
on
the
downs
by
the
king
and
that
it
was
fixed
for
the
day
following
this
information
soon
spread
through
the
village
and
country
round
and
next
morning
the
whole
population
of
overcombe
except
two
or
three
very
old
men
and
women
a
few
babies
and
their
nurses
a
cripple
and
corporal
tullidge
ascended
the
slope
with
the
crowds
from
afar
and
awaited
the
events
of
the
day
the
miller
wore
his
best
coat
on
this
occasion
which
meant
a
good
deal
an
overcombe
man
in
those
days
would
have
a
best
coat
and
keep
it
as
a
best
coat
half
his
life
the
miller
had
seen
five
and
twenty
summers
chiefly
through
the
chinks
of
a
and
was
not
at
all
shabby
as
yet
though
getting
singular
but
that
could
not
be
helped
common
coats
and
best
coats
were
distinct
species
and
never
interchangeable
living
so
near
the
scene
of
the
review
he
walked
up
the
hill
accompanied
by
garland
and
anne
as
usual
it
was
a
clear
day
with
little
wind
stirring
and
the
view
from
the
downs
one
of
the
most
extensive
in
the
county
was
unclouded
the
eye
of
any
observer
who
cared
for
such
things
swept
over
the
town
and
the
bay
beyond
and
the
isle
with
its
pebble
bank
lying
on
the
sea
to
the
left
of
these
like
a
great
crouching
animal
tethered
to
the
mainland
on
the
extreme
east
of
the
marine
horizon
head
closed
the
scene
the
sea
to
the
southward
of
that
point
glaring
like
a
mirror
under
the
sun
inland
could
be
seen
badbury
rings
where
a
beacon
had
been
recently
erected
and
nearer
rainbarrow
on
egdon
heath
where
another
stood
farther
to
the
left
bulbarrow
where
there
was
yet
another
not
far
from
this
came
nettlecombe
tout
to
the
west
dogberry
hill
and
near
to
the
foreground
the
beacon
thereon
being
built
of
furze
faggots
thatched
with
straw
and
standing
on
the
spot
where
the
monument
now
raises
its
head
at
nine
the
troops
marched
upon
the
ground
some
from
the
camps
in
the
vicinity
and
some
from
quarters
in
the
different
towns
round
about
the
approaches
to
the
down
were
blocked
with
carriages
of
all
descriptions
ages
and
colours
and
with
pedestrians
of
every
class
at
ten
the
royal
personages
were
said
to
be
drawing
near
and
soon
after
the
king
accompanied
by
the
dukes
of
cambridge
and
cumberland
and
a
couple
of
generals
appeared
on
horseback
wearing
a
round
hat
turned
up
at
the
side
with
a
cockade
and
military
feather
sensation
among
the
crowd
then
the
queen
and
three
of
the
princesses
entered
the
field
in
a
great
coach
drawn
by
six
beautiful
horses
another
coach
with
four
horses
of
the
same
sort
brought
the
two
remaining
princesses
confused
acclamations
king
jarge
queen
sharlett
sophiar
and
meelyer
from
the
surrounding
spectators
anne
and
her
party
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
a
position
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
barrows
which
rose
here
and
there
on
the
down
and
the
miller
having
gallantly
constructed
a
little
cairn
of
flints
he
placed
the
two
women
thereon
by
which
means
they
were
enabled
to
see
over
the
heads
horses
and
coaches
of
the
multitudes
below
and
around
at
the
the
miller
eye
which
had
been
wandering
about
for
the
purpose
discovered
his
son
in
his
place
by
the
trumpeters
who
had
moved
forwards
in
two
ranks
and
were
sounding
the
march
john
he
cried
to
the
widow
is
of
two
colours
d
see
and
the
others
be
plain
garland
too
saw
him
now
and
enthusiastically
admired
him
from
her
hands
upwards
and
anne
silently
did
the
same
but
before
the
young
woman
eyes
had
quite
left
the
they
fell
upon
the
figure
of
yeoman
festus
riding
with
his
troop
and
keeping
his
face
at
a
medium
between
haughtiness
and
mere
bravery
he
certainly
looked
as
soldierly
as
any
of
his
own
corps
and
felt
more
soldierly
than
as
anybody
could
see
by
observing
him
anne
got
behind
the
miller
in
case
festus
should
discover
her
and
regardless
of
his
monarch
rush
upon
her
in
a
rage
with
the
devil
did
you
run
away
from
me
that
night
hey
madam
but
she
resolved
to
think
no
more
of
him
just
now
and
to
stick
to
loveday
who
was
her
mother
friend
in
this
she
was
helped
by
the
stirring
tones
which
burst
from
the
latter
gentleman
and
his
subordinates
from
time
to
time
said
the
miller
complacently
few
of
more
consequence
in
a
regiment
than
a
trumpeter
he
the
chap
that
tells
what
to
do
after
all
hey
mrs
garland
he
is
miller
said
she
could
no
more
do
without
jack
and
his
men
than
they
could
without
generals
they
could
not
said
garland
again
in
a
tone
of
pleasant
agreement
with
any
one
in
great
britain
or
ireland
it
was
said
that
the
line
that
day
was
three
miles
long
reaching
from
the
high
ground
on
the
right
of
where
the
people
stood
to
the
turnpike
road
on
the
left
after
the
review
came
a
sham
fight
during
which
action
the
crowd
dispersed
more
widely
over
the
downs
enabling
widow
garland
to
get
still
clearer
glimpses
of
the
king
and
his
handsome
charger
and
the
head
of
the
queen
and
the
elbows
and
shoulders
of
the
princesses
in
the
carriages
and
fractional
parts
of
general
garth
and
the
duke
of
cumberland
which
sights
gave
her
great
gratification
she
tugged
at
her
daughter
at
every
opportunity
exclaiming
you
can
see
his
feather
her
hat
her
majesty
india
muslin
shawl
in
a
minor
form
of
ecstasy
that
made
the
miller
think
her
more
girlish
and
animated
than
her
daughter
anne
in
those
military
manoeuvres
the
miller
followed
the
fortunes
of
one
man
anne
garland
of
two
the
spectators
who
unlike
our
party
had
no
personal
interest
in
the
soldiery
saw
only
troops
and
battalions
in
the
concrete
straight
lines
of
red
straight
lines
of
blue
white
lines
formed
of
innumerable
black
lines
formed
of
many
gaiters
coming
and
going
in
kaleidoscopic
change
who
thought
of
every
point
in
the
line
as
an
isolated
man
each
dwelling
all
to
himself
in
the
hermitage
of
his
own
mind
one
person
did
a
young
man
far
removed
from
the
barrow
where
the
garlands
and
miller
loveday
stood
the
natural
expression
of
his
face
was
somewhat
obscured
by
the
bronzing
effects
of
rough
weather
but
the
lines
of
his
mouth
showed
that
affectionate
impulses
were
strong
within
him
perhaps
stronger
than
judgment
well
could
regulate
he
wore
a
blue
jacket
with
little
brass
buttons
and
was
plainly
a
seafaring
man
meanwhile
in
the
part
of
the
plain
where
rose
the
tumulus
on
which
the
miller
had
established
himself
a
tradesman
was
elbowing
his
way
along
he
saw
loveday
from
the
base
of
the
barrow
and
beckoned
to
attract
his
attention
loveday
went
halfway
down
and
the
other
came
up
as
near
as
he
could
said
the
man
letter
has
been
lying
at
the
for
you
for
the
last
three
days
if
i
had
known
that
i
should
see
ye
here
i
have
brought
it
along
with
me
the
miller
thanked
him
for
the
news
and
they
parted
loveday
returning
to
the
summit
a
very
strange
thing
he
said
to
garland
who
had
looked
inquiringly
at
his
face
now
very
grave
was
budmouth
postmaster
and
he
says
there
a
letter
for
me
ah
i
now
call
to
mind
that
there
a
letter
in
the
candle
three
days
ago
this
very
night
a
large
red
one
but
i
thought
nothing
who
that
letter
be
from
a
letter
at
this
time
was
such
an
event
for
hamleteers
even
of
the
miller
respectable
standing
that
loveday
thenceforward
was
thrown
into
a
fit
of
abstraction
which
prevented
his
seeing
any
more
of
the
sham
fight
or
the
people
or
the
king
garland
imbibed
some
of
his
concern
and
suggested
that
the
letter
might
come
from
his
son
robert
should
naturally
have
thought
that
said
miller
loveday
he
wrote
to
me
only
two
months
ago
and
his
brother
john
heard
from
him
within
the
last
four
weeks
when
he
was
just
about
starting
on
another
voyage
if
you
pardon
me
garland
i
see
if
any
overcombe
man
here
who
is
going
to
budmouth
so
that
i
may
get
the
letter
by
i
can
not
possibly
go
myself
so
loveday
left
them
for
awhile
and
as
they
were
so
near
home
garland
did
not
wait
on
the
barrow
for
him
to
come
back
but
walked
about
with
anne
a
little
time
until
they
should
be
disposed
to
trot
down
the
slope
to
their
own
door
they
listened
to
a
man
who
was
offering
one
guinea
to
receive
ten
in
case
buonaparte
should
be
killed
in
three
months
and
to
other
entertainments
of
that
nature
which
at
this
time
were
not
rare
once
during
their
peregrination
the
eyes
of
the
sailor
fell
upon
anne
but
he
glanced
over
her
and
passed
her
unheedingly
by
loveday
the
elder
was
at
this
time
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
looking
for
a
messenger
to
the
town
at
twelve
the
review
was
over
and
the
king
and
his
family
left
the
hill
the
troops
then
cleared
off
the
field
the
spectators
followed
and
by
one
the
downs
were
again
bare
they
still
spread
their
grassy
surface
to
the
sun
as
on
that
beautiful
morning
not
historically
speaking
so
very
long
ago
but
the
king
and
his
fifteen
thousand
armed
men
the
horses
the
bands
of
music
the
princesses
the
teams
the
gorgeous
in
short
to
which
the
downs
were
but
the
mere
mount
or
margin
how
entirely
have
they
all
passed
and
gone
lying
scattered
about
the
world
as
military
and
other
dust
some
at
talavera
albuera
salamanca
vittoria
toulouse
and
waterloo
some
in
home
churchyards
and
a
few
small
handfuls
in
royal
vaults
in
the
afternoon
john
loveday
lightened
of
his
trumpet
and
trappings
appeared
at
the
old
door
and
beheld
anne
standing
at
hers
saw
you
miss
garland
said
the
soldier
gaily
was
i
said
she
smiling
the
top
of
the
big
mound
to
the
right
of
the
king
i
saw
you
lots
of
times
she
rejoined
loveday
seemed
pleased
you
really
take
the
trouble
to
find
me
that
was
very
good
of
you
eyes
followed
you
everywhere
said
garland
from
an
upper
window
course
i
looked
at
the
dragoons
most
said
anne
disconcerted
when
i
looked
at
them
my
eyes
naturally
fell
upon
the
trumpets
i
looked
at
the
dragoons
generally
no
more
she
did
not
mean
to
show
any
vexation
to
the
but
he
fancied
otherwise
and
stood
repressed
the
situation
was
relieved
by
the
arrival
of
the
miller
still
looking
serious
am
very
much
concerned
john
i
did
not
go
to
the
review
for
nothing
there
a
letter
for
me
at
budmouth
and
i
must
get
it
before
bedtime
or
i
sha
sleep
a
wink
go
of
course
said
john
perhaps
miss
garland
would
like
to
see
what
doing
there
everybody
is
gone
or
going
the
road
is
like
a
fair
he
spoke
pleadingly
but
anne
was
not
won
to
assent
can
drive
in
the
gig
do
blossom
good
said
the
miller
david
drive
miss
garland
said
the
not
wishing
to
coerce
her
would
just
as
soon
walk
anne
joyfully
welcomed
this
arrangement
and
a
time
was
fixed
for
the
start
xiii
the
conversation
in
the
crowd
in
the
afternoon
they
drove
off
john
loveday
being
nowhere
visible
all
along
the
road
they
passed
and
were
overtaken
by
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
going
in
the
same
direction
among
them
the
extraordinary
machines
which
had
been
invented
for
the
conveyance
of
troops
to
any
point
of
the
coast
on
which
the
enemy
should
land
they
consisted
of
four
boards
placed
across
a
sort
of
trolly
thirty
men
of
the
volunteer
companies
riding
on
each
the
popular
georgian
was
in
a
paroxysm
of
gaiety
the
town
was
quite
overpowered
by
the
country
round
much
to
the
delight
and
profit
the
fear
of
invasion
was
such
that
six
frigates
lay
in
the
roads
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
royal
family
and
from
the
regiments
of
horse
and
foot
quartered
at
the
barracks
or
encamped
on
the
hills
round
about
a
picket
of
a
thousand
men
mounted
guard
every
day
in
front
of
gloucester
lodge
where
the
king
resided
when
anne
and
her
attendant
reached
this
point
which
they
did
on
foot
stabling
the
horse
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
it
was
about
six
the
king
was
on
the
esplanade
and
the
soldiers
were
just
marching
past
to
mount
guard
the
band
formed
in
front
of
the
king
and
all
the
officers
saluted
as
they
went
by
anne
now
felt
herself
close
to
and
looking
into
the
stream
of
recorded
history
within
whose
banks
the
littlest
things
are
great
and
outside
which
she
and
the
general
bulk
of
the
human
race
were
content
to
live
on
as
an
unreckoned
unheeded
superfluity
when
she
turned
from
her
interested
gaze
at
this
scene
there
stood
john
loveday
she
had
had
a
presentiment
that
he
would
turn
up
in
this
mysterious
way
it
was
marvellous
that
he
could
have
got
there
so
quickly
but
there
he
was
not
looking
at
the
king
or
at
the
crowd
but
waiting
for
the
turn
of
her
head
i
did
see
you
said
anne
demurely
is
it
that
your
regiment
is
not
marching
past
take
it
by
turns
and
it
is
not
our
turn
said
loveday
she
wanted
to
know
then
if
they
were
afraid
that
the
king
would
be
carried
off
by
the
first
consul
yes
loveday
told
her
and
his
majesty
was
rather
venturesome
a
day
or
two
before
he
had
gone
so
far
to
sea
that
he
was
nearly
caught
by
some
of
the
enemy
cruisers
is
anxious
to
fight
boney
he
said
a
good
brave
king
said
anne
loveday
seemed
anxious
to
come
to
more
personal
matters
you
let
me
take
you
round
to
the
other
side
where
you
can
see
better
he
asked
queen
and
the
princesses
are
at
the
window
anne
passively
assented
wait
here
for
me
she
said
shall
be
back
again
in
a
few
minutes
the
then
led
her
off
triumphantly
and
they
skirted
the
crowd
and
came
round
on
the
side
towards
the
sands
he
told
her
everything
he
could
think
of
military
and
civil
to
which
anne
returned
pretty
syllables
and
parenthetic
words
about
the
colour
of
the
sea
and
the
curl
of
the
foam
a
way
of
speaking
that
moved
the
soldier
heart
even
more
than
long
and
direct
speeches
would
have
done
that
other
thing
i
asked
you
he
ventured
to
say
at
last
wo
speak
of
it
do
dislike
me
no
she
said
gazing
at
the
digging
children
and
other
common
objects
of
the
seashore
as
if
her
interest
lay
there
rather
than
with
him
i
am
not
worthy
of
the
daughter
of
a
genteel
professional
man
what
you
mean
something
more
than
worthiness
required
in
such
cases
you
know
she
said
still
without
calling
her
mind
away
from
surrounding
scenes
there
are
the
queen
and
princesses
at
the
window
more
since
you
will
make
me
speak
i
mean
the
woman
ought
to
love
the
man
the
seemed
to
be
less
concerned
about
this
than
about
her
supposed
superiority
it
were
all
right
on
that
point
would
you
mind
the
other
he
asked
like
a
man
who
knows
he
is
too
persistent
yet
who
can
not
be
still
can
i
say
when
i
do
know
what
a
pretty
chip
hat
the
elder
princess
wears
her
companion
general
disappointment
extended
over
him
almost
to
his
lace
and
his
plume
mother
said
you
know
miss
anne
that
the
worst
of
it
she
said
us
go
back
to
david
i
have
seen
all
i
want
to
see
mr
loveday
the
mass
of
the
people
had
by
this
time
noticed
the
queen
and
princesses
at
the
window
and
raised
a
cheer
to
which
the
ladies
waved
their
embroidered
handkerchiefs
anne
went
back
towards
the
pavement
with
her
whom
all
the
girls
envied
her
so
a
soldier
was
he
and
not
only
for
that
but
because
it
was
well
known
that
he
was
not
a
soldier
from
necessity
but
from
patriotism
his
father
having
repeatedly
offered
to
set
him
up
in
business
his
artistic
taste
in
preferring
a
horse
and
uniform
to
a
dirty
rumbling
was
admired
by
all
she
too
had
a
very
nice
appearance
in
her
best
clothes
as
she
walked
along
the
sarcenet
hat
muslin
shawl
and
gown
being
of
the
newest
overcombe
fashion
that
was
only
about
a
year
old
in
the
adjoining
town
and
in
london
three
or
four
she
could
not
be
harsh
to
loveday
and
dismiss
him
curtly
for
his
musical
pursuits
had
refined
him
educated
him
and
made
him
quite
poetical
he
had
been
particularly
and
tender
so
instead
of
answering
speak
to
me
like
this
again
she
merely
put
him
off
with
a
us
go
back
to
david
when
they
reached
the
place
where
they
had
left
him
david
was
gone
anne
was
now
positively
vexed
i
do
she
said
only
gone
to
drink
the
king
health
said
loveday
who
had
privately
given
david
the
money
for
performing
that
operation
upon
it
he
be
back
soon
you
go
and
find
him
said
she
with
intense
propriety
in
her
looks
and
tone
will
said
loveday
reluctantly
and
he
went
anne
stood
still
she
could
now
escape
her
gallant
friend
for
although
the
distance
was
long
it
was
not
impossible
to
walk
home
on
the
other
hand
loveday
was
a
good
and
sincere
fellow
for
whom
she
had
almost
a
brotherly
feeling
and
she
shrank
from
such
a
trick
while
she
stood
and
mused
scarcely
heeding
the
music
the
marching
of
the
soldiers
the
king
the
dukes
the
brilliant
staff
the
attendants
and
the
happy
groups
of
people
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
ground
before
her
she
saw
a
flower
lying
a
crimson
fresh
and
uninjured
an
instinctive
wish
to
save
it
from
destruction
by
the
passengers
feet
led
her
to
pick
it
up
and
then
moved
by
a
sudden
consciousness
she
looked
around
she
was
standing
before
an
inn
and
from
an
upper
window
festus
derriman
was
leaning
with
two
or
three
kindred
spirits
of
his
cut
and
kind
he
nodded
eagerly
and
signified
to
her
that
he
had
thrown
the
flower
what
should
she
do
to
throw
it
away
would
seem
stupid
and
to
keep
it
was
awkward
she
held
it
between
her
finger
and
thumb
twirled
it
round
on
its
axis
and
twirled
it
back
again
regarding
and
yet
not
examining
it
just
then
she
saw
the
coming
back
ca
find
david
anywhere
he
said
and
his
heart
was
not
sorry
as
he
said
it
anne
was
still
holding
out
the
as
if
about
to
drop
it
and
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
under
the
distressing
sense
that
she
was
watched
she
offered
the
flower
to
loveday
his
face
brightened
with
pleasure
as
he
took
it
you
indeed
he
said
then
anne
saw
what
a
misleading
blunder
she
had
committed
towards
loveday
in
playing
to
the
yeoman
perhaps
she
had
sown
the
seeds
of
a
quarrel
was
not
my
she
said
hastily
was
lying
on
the
ground
i
do
mean
anything
by
giving
it
to
you
i
keep
it
all
the
same
said
the
innocent
soldier
as
if
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
womankind
and
he
put
the
flower
carefully
inside
his
jacket
between
his
white
waistcoat
and
his
heart
festus
seeing
this
enlarged
himself
wrathfully
got
hot
in
the
face
rose
to
his
feet
and
glared
down
upon
them
like
a
us
go
away
said
anne
timorously
see
you
safe
to
your
own
door
depend
upon
me
said
loveday
i
had
near
forgot
there
father
letter
that
he
so
anxiously
waiting
for
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
then
i
take
you
straight
home
anne
expecting
festus
to
pounce
down
every
minute
was
glad
to
be
off
anywhere
so
she
accepted
the
suggestion
and
they
went
along
the
parade
together
loveday
set
this
down
as
a
proof
of
anne
relenting
thus
in
joyful
spirits
he
entered
the
office
paid
the
postage
and
received
the
letter
is
from
bob
after
all
he
said
told
me
to
read
it
at
once
in
case
of
bad
news
ask
your
pardon
for
keeping
you
a
moment
he
broke
the
seal
and
read
anne
standing
silently
by
is
coming
home
be
said
the
without
looking
up
anne
did
not
answer
the
blood
swept
impetuously
up
her
face
at
his
words
and
as
suddenly
went
away
again
leaving
her
rather
paler
than
before
she
disguised
her
agitation
and
then
overcame
it
loveday
observing
nothing
of
this
emotional
performance
far
as
i
can
understand
he
will
be
here
saturday
he
said
said
anne
quite
calmly
who
is
he
going
to
marry
i
do
know
said
john
turning
the
letter
about
woman
is
a
stranger
at
this
moment
the
miller
entered
the
office
hastily
john
he
cried
have
been
waiting
and
waiting
for
that
there
letter
till
i
was
nigh
crazy
john
briefly
explained
the
news
and
when
his
father
had
recovered
from
his
astonishment
taken
off
his
hat
and
wiped
the
exact
line
where
his
forehead
joined
his
hair
he
walked
with
anne
up
the
street
leaving
john
to
return
alone
the
miller
was
so
absorbed
in
his
mental
perspective
of
bob
marriage
that
he
saw
nothing
of
the
gaieties
they
passed
through
and
anne
seemed
also
so
much
impressed
by
the
same
intelligence
that
she
crossed
before
the
inn
occupied
by
festus
without
showing
a
recollection
of
his
presence
there
xiv
later
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
when
they
reached
home
the
sun
was
going
down
it
had
already
been
noised
abroad
that
miller
loveday
had
received
a
letter
and
his
cart
having
been
heard
coming
up
the
lane
the
population
of
overcombe
drew
down
towards
the
mill
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
indoors
a
sudden
flash
of
brightness
from
the
window
showing
that
he
had
struck
such
an
early
light
as
nothing
but
the
immediate
deciphering
of
literature
could
require
letters
were
matters
of
public
moment
and
everybody
in
the
parish
had
an
interest
in
the
reading
of
those
rare
documents
so
that
when
the
miller
had
placed
the
candle
slanted
himself
and
called
in
garland
to
have
her
opinion
on
the
meaning
of
any
hieroglyphics
that
he
might
encounter
in
his
course
he
found
that
he
was
to
be
additionally
assisted
by
the
opinions
of
the
other
neighbours
whose
persons
appeared
in
the
doorway
partly
covering
each
other
like
a
hand
of
cards
yet
each
showing
a
large
enough
piece
of
himself
for
identification
to
pass
the
time
while
they
were
arranging
themselves
the
miller
adopted
his
usual
way
of
filling
up
casual
intervals
that
of
snuffing
the
candle
heard
you
had
got
a
letter
maister
loveday
they
said
southampton
the
twelfth
of
august
dear
father
said
loveday
and
they
were
as
silent
as
relations
at
the
reading
of
a
will
anne
for
whom
the
letter
had
a
singular
fascination
came
in
with
her
mother
and
sat
down
bob
stated
in
his
own
way
that
having
since
landing
taken
into
consideration
his
father
wish
that
he
should
renounce
a
seafaring
life
and
become
a
partner
in
the
mill
he
had
decided
to
agree
to
the
proposal
and
with
that
object
in
view
he
would
return
to
overcombe
in
three
days
from
the
time
of
writing
he
then
said
incidentally
that
since
his
voyage
he
had
been
in
lodgings
at
southampton
and
during
that
time
had
become
acquainted
with
a
lovely
and
virtuous
young
maiden
in
whom
he
found
the
exact
qualities
necessary
to
his
happiness
having
known
this
lady
for
the
full
space
of
a
fortnight
he
had
had
ample
opportunities
of
studying
her
character
and
being
struck
with
the
recollection
that
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
necessary
in
a
mill
which
had
no
mistress
it
was
somebody
who
could
play
that
part
with
grace
and
dignity
he
had
asked
miss
matilda
johnson
to
be
his
wife
in
her
kindness
she
though
sacrificing
far
better
prospects
had
agreed
and
he
could
not
but
regard
it
as
a
happy
chance
that
he
should
have
found
at
the
nick
of
time
such
a
woman
to
adorn
his
home
whose
innocence
was
as
stunning
as
her
beauty
without
much
ado
therefore
he
and
she
had
arranged
to
be
married
at
once
and
at
overcombe
that
his
father
might
not
be
deprived
of
the
pleasures
of
the
wedding
feast
she
had
kindly
consented
to
follow
him
by
land
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
and
to
live
in
the
house
as
their
guest
for
the
week
or
so
previous
to
the
ceremony
a
proper
good
letter
said
mrs
comfort
from
the
background
never
heerd
true
love
better
put
out
of
hand
in
my
life
and
they
seem
fond
of
one
another
have
knowed
her
such
a
very
long
time
said
job
mitchell
dubiously
nothing
said
esther
beach
will
find
her
way
very
rapid
when
the
time
come
well
is
good
news
for
ye
miller
sure
i
hope
is
said
loveday
without
however
showing
any
great
hurry
to
burst
into
the
frantic
form
of
fatherly
joy
which
the
event
should
naturally
have
produced
seeming
more
disposed
to
let
off
his
feelings
by
examining
thoroughly
into
the
fibres
of
the
was
five
years
my
wife
he
presently
remarked
folks
were
slower
about
everything
in
them
days
well
since
she
coming
we
must
make
her
welcome
did
any
of
ye
catch
by
my
reading
which
day
it
is
he
means
what
with
making
out
the
penmanship
my
mind
was
drawn
off
from
the
sense
here
and
there
says
in
three
days
said
garland
date
of
the
letter
will
fix
it
on
examination
it
was
found
that
the
day
appointed
was
the
one
nearly
expired
at
which
the
miller
jumped
up
and
said
he
be
here
before
bedtime
i
did
gather
till
now
that
he
was
coming
afore
saturday
why
he
may
drop
in
this
very
minute
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
footsteps
were
heard
coming
along
the
front
and
they
presently
halted
at
the
door
loveday
pushed
through
the
neighbours
and
rushed
out
and
seeing
in
the
passage
a
form
which
obscured
the
declining
light
the
miller
seized
hold
of
him
saying
my
dear
bob
then
you
are
come
it
all
miller
do
quite
pull
my
poor
shoulder
out
of
joint
whatever

the
trying
to
release
himself
from
loveday
grasp
of
affection
it
was
uncle
benjy

my
son
faltered
the
miller
sinking
back
upon
the
toes
of
the
neighbours
who
had
closely
followed
him
into
the
entry
come
in
derriman
and
make
yerself
at
home
why

been
here
for
years

loveday
i
know
ye
to
be
an
honest
man
repeated
the
old
squireen
i
speak
to
ye
alone
as
the
house
was
full
loveday
took
him
into
the
garden
all
the
while
upon
not
lest
buonaparte
should
appear
in
their
midst
but
lest
bob
should
come
whilst
he
was
not
there
to
receive
him
when
they
had
got
into
a
corner
uncle
benjy
said
what
with
the
french
and
what
with
my
nephew
festus
i
assure
ye
my
life
is
nothing
but
wherrit
from
morning
to
night
miller
loveday
you
are
an
honest
man
loveday
nodded
i
come
to
ask
a
favour
to
ask
if
you
will
take
charge
of
my
few
poor
and
documents
and
suchlike
while
i
am
away
from
home
next
week
lest
anything
should
befall
me
and
they
should
be
stole
away
by
boney
or
festus
and
i
should
have
nothing
left
in
the
wide
world
i
can
trust
neither
banks
nor
lawyers
in
these
terrible
times
and
i
am
come
to
you
loveday
after
some
hesitation
agreed
to
take
care
of
anything
that
derriman
should
bring
whereupon
the
farmer
said
he
would
call
with
the
parchments
and
papers
alluded
to
in
the
course
of
a
week
derriman
then
went
away
by
the
garden
gate
mounted
his
pony
which
had
been
tethered
outside
and
rode
on
till
his
form
was
lost
in
the
shades
the
miller
rejoined
his
friends
and
found
that
in
the
meantime
john
had
arrived
john
informed
the
company
that
after
parting
from
his
father
and
anne
he
had
rambled
to
the
harbour
and
discovered
the
pewit
by
the
quay
on
inquiry
he
had
learnt
that
she
came
in
at
eleven
and
that
bob
had
gone
ashore
go
and
meet
him
said
the
miller
still
light
out
of
doors
so
as
the
dew
rose
from
the
meads
and
formed
fleeces
in
the
hollows
loveday
and
his
friends
and
neighbours
strolled
out
and
loitered
by
the
stiles
which
hampered
the
footpath
from
overcombe
to
the
high
road
at
intervals
of
a
hundred
yards
john
loveday
being
obliged
to
return
to
camp
was
unable
to
accompany
them
but
widow
garland
thought
proper
to
fall
in
with
the
procession
when
she
had
put
on
her
bonnet
she
called
to
her
daughter
anne
said
from
upstairs
that
she
was
coming
in
a
minute
and
her
mother
walked
on
without
her
what
was
anne
doing
having
hastily
unlocked
a
receptacle
for
emotional
objects
of
small
size
she
took
thence
the
little
folded
paper
with
which
we
have
already
become
acquainted
and
striking
a
light
from
her
private
she
held
the
paper
and
curl
of
hair
it
contained
in
the
candle
till
they
were
burnt
then
she
put
on
her
hat
and
followed
her
mother
and
the
rest
of
them
across
the
moist
grey
fields
cheerfully
singing
in
an
undertone
as
she
went
to
assure
herself
of
her
indifference
to
circumstances
xv
bob
loveday
of
the
merchant
service
while
loveday
and
his
neighbours
were
thus
rambling
forth
full
of
expectancy
some
of
them
including
anne
in
the
rear
heard
the
crackling
of
light
wheels
along
the
curved
lane
to
which
the
path
was
the
chord
at
once
anne
thought
that
he
and
we
are
missing
him
but
recent
events
were
not
of
a
kind
to
induce
her
to
say
anything
and
the
others
of
the
company
did
not
reflect
on
the
sound
had
they
gone
across
to
the
hedge
which
hid
the
lane
and
looked
through
it
they
would
have
seen
a
light
cart
driven
by
a
boy
beside
whom
was
seated
a
seafaring
man
apparently
of
good
standing
in
the
merchant
service
with
his
feet
outside
on
the
shaft
the
vehicle
went
over
the
main
bridge
turned
in
upon
the
other
bridge
at
the
tail
of
the
mill
and
halted
by
the
door
the
sailor
alighted
showing
himself
to
be
a
shaped
active
and
fine
young
man
with
a
bright
eye
an
anonymous
nose
and
of
such
a
rich
complexion
by
exposure
to
ripening
suns
that
he
might
have
been
some
connexion
of
the
foreigner
who
calls
his
likeness
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
in
galleries
of
the
old
masters
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
though
bob
loveday
had
been
all
over
the
world
from
cape
horn
to
pekin
and
from
india
coral
strand
to
the
white
sea
the
most
conspicuous
of
all
the
marks
that
he
had
brought
back
with
him
was
an
increased
resemblance
to
his
mother
who
had
lain
all
the
time
beneath
overcombe
church
wall
captain
loveday
tried
the
house
door
finding
this
locked
he
went
to
the
mill
door
this
was
locked
also
the
mill
being
stopped
for
the
night
are
not
at
home
he
said
to
the
boy
never
mind
that
just
help
to
unload
the
things
and
then
i
pay
you
and
you
can
drive
off
home
the
cart
was
unloaded
and
the
boy
was
dismissed
thanking
the
sailor
profusely
for
the
payment
rendered
then
bob
loveday
finding
that
he
had
still
some
leisure
on
his
hands
looked
musingly
east
west
north
south
and
nadir
after
which
he
bestirred
himself
by
carrying
his
goods
article
by
article
round
to
the
back
door
out
of
the
way
of
casual
passers
this
done
he
walked
round
the
mill
in
a
more
regardful
attitude
and
surveyed
its
familiar
features
one
by
one
the
panes
of
the
now
as
heretofore
clouded
with
flour
as
with
stale
frost
the
meal
lodged
in
the
corners
of
the
forming
a
soil
in
which
lichens
grew
without
ever
getting
any
bigger
as
they
had
done
since
his
smallest
infancy
the
mosses
on
the
plinth
towards
the
river
reaching
as
high
as
the
capillary
power
of
the
walls
would
fetch
up
moisture
for
their
nourishment
and
the
penned
now
as
ever
on
the
point
of
overflowing
into
the
garden
everything
was
the
same
when
he
had
had
enough
of
this
it
occurred
to
loveday
that
he
might
get
into
the
house
in
spite
of
the
locked
doors
and
by
entering
the
garden
placing
a
pole
from
the
fork
of
an
to
the
of
a
bedroom
on
that
side
and
climbing
across
like
a
barbary
ape
he
entered
the
window
and
stepped
down
inside
there
was
something
anomalous
in
being
close
to
the
familiar
furniture
without
having
first
seen
his
father
and
its
silent
impassive
shine
was
not
cheering
it
was
as
if
his
relations
were
all
dead
and
only
their
tables
and
chests
of
drawers
left
to
greet
him
he
went
downstairs
and
seated
himself
in
the
dark
parlour
finding
this
place
too
rather
solitary
and
the
tick
of
the
invisible
clock
preternaturally
loud
he
unearthed
the
obtained
a
light
and
set
about
making
the
house
comfortable
for
his
father
return
divining
that
the
miller
had
gone
out
to
meet
him
by
the
wrong
road
robert
interest
in
this
work
increased
as
he
proceeded
and
he
bustled
round
and
round
the
kitchen
as
lightly
as
a
girl
david
the
indoor
factotum
having
lost
himself
among
the
quart
pots
of
budmouth
there
had
been
nobody
left
here
to
prepare
supper
and
bob
had
it
all
to
himself
in
a
short
time
a
fire
blazed
up
the
chimney
a
tablecloth
was
found
the
plates
were
clapped
down
and
a
search
made
for
what
provisions
the
house
afforded
which
in
addition
to
various
meats
included
some
fresh
eggs
of
the
elongated
shape
that
produces
cockerels
when
hatched
and
had
been
set
aside
on
that
account
for
putting
under
the
next
broody
hen
a
more
reckless
cracking
of
eggs
than
that
which
now
went
on
had
never
been
known
in
overcombe
since
the
last
large
christening
and
as
loveday
gashed
one
on
the
side
another
at
the
end
another
longways
and
another
diagonally
he
acquired
adroitness
by
practice
and
at
last
made
every
son
of
a
hen
of
them
fall
into
two
hemispheres
as
neatly
as
if
it
opened
by
a
hinge
from
eggs
he
proceeded
to
ham
and
from
ham
to
kidneys
the
result
being
a
brilliant
fry
not
to
be
tempted
to
fall
to
before
his
father
came
back
the
returned
navigator
emptied
the
whole
into
a
dish
laid
a
plate
over
the
top
his
coat
over
the
plate
and
his
hat
over
his
coat
thus
completely
stopping
in
the
appetizing
smell
he
sat
down
to
await
events
he
was
relieved
from
the
tediousness
of
doing
this
by
hearing
voices
outside
and
in
a
minute
his
father
entered
to
welcome
ye
home
father
said
bob
supper
is
just
ready
lard
why
captain
bob
here
said
garland
we
been
out
waiting
to
meet
thee
said
the
miller
as
he
entered
the
room
followed
by
representatives
of
the
houses
of
cripplestraw
comfort
mitchell
beach
and
snooks
together
with
some
small
beginnings
of
fencible
tremlett
posterity
in
the
rear
came
david
and
quite
in
the
of
the
composition
anne
the
fair
drove
over
and
so
was
forced
to
come
by
the
road
said
bob
we
went
across
the
fields
thinking
you
walk
said
his
father
should
have
been
here
this
morning
but
not
so
much
as
a
wheelbarrow
could
i
get
for
my
traps
everything
was
gone
to
the
review
so
i
went
too
thinking
i
might
meet
you
there
i
was
then
obliged
to
return
to
the
harbour
for
the
luggage
then
there
was
a
welcoming
of
captain
bob
by
pulling
out
his
arms
like
drawers
and
shutting
them
again
smacking
him
on
the
back
as
if
he
were
choking
holding
him
at
arm
length
as
if
he
were
of
too
large
type
to
read
close
all
which
persecution
bob
bore
with
a
wide
genial
smile
that
was
shaken
into
fragments
and
scattered
promiscuously
among
the
spectators
a
chair
for
said
the
miller
to
david
whom
they
had
met
in
the
fields
and
found
to
have
got
nothing
worse
by
his
absence
than
a
slight
slant
in
his
walk
mind
i
am
not
tired
i
have
been
here
ever
so
long
said
bob
i
but
the
chair
having
been
placed
behind
him
and
a
smart
touch
in
the
hollow
of
a
person
knee
by
the
edge
of
that
piece
of
furniture
having
a
tendency
to
make
the
person
sit
without
further
argument
bob
sank
down
dumb
and
the
others
drew
up
other
chairs
at
a
convenient
nearness
for
easy
analytic
vision
and
the
subtler
forms
of
good
fellowship
the
miller
went
about
saying
the
nine
best
glasses
from
the
corner
cupboard
the
corkscrew
whisk
the
tail
of
thy
round
the
inside
of
these
quart
pots
afore
you
draw
drink
in
they
be
an
inch
thick
in
dust
lower
that
a
couple
of
notches
that
the
flame
may
touch
the
bottom
of
the
kettle
and
light
three
more
of
the
largest
candles
you
get
the
cork
out
of
the
jar
david
bore
a
hole
in
the
tub
of
hollands
that
buried
under
the
scroff
in
the
d
hear
dan
brown
left
en
there
yesterday
as
a
return
for
the
little
porker
i
gied
en
when
they
had
all
had
a
thimbleful
round
and
the
superfluous
neighbours
had
reluctantly
departed
one
by
one
the
inmates
gave
their
minds
to
the
supper
which
david
had
begun
to
serve
up
be
you
rolling
back
the
tablecloth
for
david
said
the
miller
bob
have
put
down
one
of
the
under
sheets
by
mistake
and
i
thought
you
might
not
like
it
sir
as
there
ladies
present
was
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
said
robert
seemed
a
tablecloth
to
me
mind
do
pull
off
the
things
now
he
laid
down
let
it
bide
said
the
miller
where
widow
garland
and
maidy
anne
were
here
but
a
minute
ago
said
david
upon
it
they
have
slinked
off
they
be
shy
the
miller
at
once
went
round
to
ask
them
to
come
back
and
sup
with
him
and
while
he
was
gone
david
told
bob
in
confidence
what
an
excellent
place
he
had
for
an
old
man
bob
as
i
suppose
i
must
call
ye
i
worked
for
yer
father
these
years
and
we
have
always
got
on
very
well
together
trusts
me
with
all
the
keys
lends
me
his
and
leaves
the
house
entirely
to
me
widow
garland
next
door
too
is
just
the
same
with
me
and
treats
me
as
if
i
was
her
own
child
must
have
married
young
to
make
you
that
david
yes
i
years
older
than
she
is
only
my
common
way
of
speaking
garland
would
not
come
in
to
supper
and
the
meal
proceeded
without
her
bob
recommending
to
his
father
the
dish
he
had
cooked
in
the
manner
of
a
householder
to
a
stranger
just
come
the
miller
was
anxious
to
know
more
about
his
son
plans
for
the
future
but
would
not
for
the
present
interrupt
his
eating
looking
up
from
his
own
plate
to
appreciate
travelled
way
of
putting
english
victuals
out
of
sight
as
he
would
have
looked
at
a
mill
on
improved
principles
david
had
only
just
got
the
table
clear
and
set
the
plates
in
a
row
under
the
bakehouse
table
for
the
cats
to
lick
when
the
door
was
hastily
opened
and
garland
came
in
looking
concerned
have
been
waiting
to
hear
the
plates
removed
to
tell
you
how
frightened
we
are
at
something
we
hear
at
the
it
seems
like
robbers
muttering
but
when
i
look
out
there
nobody
there
must
be
seen
to
said
the
miller
rising
promptly
light
the
lantern
i
go
and
search
the
garden
i
go
too
said
his
son
taking
up
a
cudgel
i
come
home
just
in
time
they
went
out
stealthily
followed
by
the
widow
and
anne
who
had
been
afraid
to
stay
alone
in
the
house
under
the
circumstances
no
sooner
were
they
beyond
the
door
when
sure
enough
there
was
the
muttering
almost
close
at
hand
and
low
upon
the
ground
as
from
persons
lying
down
in
hiding
my
heart
said
bob
striking
his
head
as
though
it
were
some
enemy
is
my
luggage
i
quite
forgot
it
asked
his
father
luggage
really
if
it
had
been
for
garland
it
would
have
stayed
there
all
night
and
they
poor
things
would
have
been
starved
i
got
all
sorts
of
articles
for
ye
you
go
inside
and
i
bring
in
is
parrots
that
you
hear
a
muttering
garland
you
be
afraid
any
more
said
the
miller
i
glad
is
no
worse
but
how
couldst
forget
so
bob
the
packages
were
taken
in
by
david
and
bob
and
the
first
unfastened
were
three
wrapped
in
cloths
which
being
stripped
off
revealed
three
cages
with
a
gorgeous
parrot
in
each
one
is
for
you
father
to
hang
up
outside
the
door
and
amuse
us
said
bob
talk
very
well
but
he
sleepy
this
other
one
i
brought
along
for
any
neighbour
that
would
like
to
have
him
his
colours
are
not
so
bright
but
is
a
good
bird
if
you
would
like
to
have
him
you
are
welcome
to
him
he
said
turning
to
anne
who
had
been
tempted
forward
by
the
birds
have
hardly
spoken
yet
miss
anne
but
i
recollect
you
very
well
how
much
taller
you
have
got
to
be
sure
anne
said
she
was
much
obliged
but
did
not
know
what
she
could
do
with
such
a
present
garland
accepted
it
for
her
and
the
sailor
went
on
this
other
bird
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
but
i
dare
say
he
come
in
for
something
or
other
is
by
far
the
prettiest
said
the
widow
would
rather
have
it
than
the
other
if
you
do
mind
said
bob
with
embarrassment
the
fact
is
that
bird
will
hardly
do
for
ye
he
a
hard
swearer
to
tell
the
truth
and
i
am
afraid
he
too
old
to
be
broken
of
it
dreadful
said
garland
could
keep
him
in
the
mill
suggested
the
miller
wo
matter
about
the
grinder
hearing
him
for
he
ca
learn
to
cuss
worse
than
he
do
already
grinder
shall
have
him
then
said
bob
one
i
have
given
you
has
no
harm
in
him
at
all
you
might
take
him
to
church
sundays
as
far
as
that
goes
the
sailor
now
untied
a
small
wooden
box
about
a
foot
square
perforated
with
holes
are
two
marmosets
he
continued
ca
see
them
but
they
are
beauties
the
tufted
sort
a
marmoset
said
the
miller
a
little
kind
of
monkey
they
bite
strangers
rather
hard
but
soon
get
used
to
are
wrapped
up
in
something
i
declare
said
garland
peeping
in
through
a
chink
that
my
flannel
shirt
said
bob
apologetically
suffer
terribly
from
cold
in
this
climate
poor
things
and
i
had
nothing
better
to
give
them
well
now
in
this
next
box
i
got
things
of
different
sorts
the
latter
was
a
regular
seaman
chest
and
out
of
it
he
produced
shells
of
many
sizes
and
colours
carved
ivories
queer
little
caskets
gorgeous
feathers
and
several
silk
handkerchiefs
which
articles
were
spread
out
upon
all
the
available
tables
and
chairs
till
the
house
began
to
look
like
a
bazaar
a
lovely
shawl
exclaimed
widow
garland
in
her
interest
forestalling
the
regular
exhibition
by
looking
into
the
box
at
what
was
coming
yes
said
the
mate
pulling
out
a
couple
of
the
most
bewitching
shawls
that
eyes
ever
saw
of
these
i
am
going
to
give
to
that
young
lady
i
am
shortly
to
be
married
to
you
know
garland
has
father
told
you
about
it
matilda
johnson
of
southampton
that
her
name
we
know
all
about
it
said
the
widow
i
shall
give
one
of
these
shawls
to
her
because
of
course
i
ought
to
course
said
she
the
other
one
i
got
no
use
for
at
all
and
he
continued
looking
round
you
have
it
miss
anne
you
refused
the
parrot
and
you
ought
not
to
refuse
this
you
said
anne
calmly
but
much
distressed
really
i
want
it
and
could
take
it
do
have
it
said
bob
in
hurt
tones
garland
being
all
the
while
on
lest
anne
should
persist
in
her
absurd
refusal
there
another
reason
why
you
ought
to
said
he
his
face
lighting
up
with
recollections
never
came
into
my
head
till
this
moment
that
i
used
to
be
your
beau
in
a
humble
sort
of
way
faith
so
i
did
and
we
used
to
meet
at
places
sometimes
did
we
that
is
when
you
were
not
too
proud
and
once
i
gave
you
or
somebody
else
a
bit
of
my
hair
in
fun
was
somebody
else
said
anne
quickly
perhaps
it
was
said
bob
innocently
it
was
you
i
used
to
meet
or
try
to
i
am
sure
well
i
never
thought
of
that
boyish
time
for
years
till
this
minute
i
am
sure
you
ought
to
accept
some
one
gift
dear
out
of
compliment
to
those
old
times
anne
drew
back
and
shook
her
head
for
she
would
not
trust
her
voice
garland
then
you
shall
have
it
said
bob
tossing
the
shawl
to
that
ready
receiver
you
do
upon
my
life
i
will
throw
it
out
to
the
first
beggar
i
see
now
here
a
parcel
of
cap
ribbons
of
the
splendidest
sort
i
could
get
have
these
do
anne
do
said
garland
promised
them
to
matilda
continued
bob
i
am
sure
she
want
as
she
has
got
some
of
her
own
and
i
would
as
soon
see
them
upon
your
head
my
dear
as
upon
hers
think
you
had
better
keep
them
for
your
bride
if
you
have
promised
them
to
her
said
garland
mildly
was
exactly
a
promise
i
just
said
til
there
some
cap
ribbons
in
my
box
if
you
would
like
to
have
them
but
she
got
enough
things
already
for
any
bride
in
creation
anne
now
you
shall
have
upon
my
soul
you
shall
or
i
fling
them
down
the
anne
had
meant
to
be
perfectly
firm
in
refusing
everything
for
reasons
obvious
even
to
that
poor
waif
the
meanest
capacity
but
when
it
came
to
this
point
she
was
absolutely
compelled
to
give
in
and
reluctantly
received
the
cap
ribbons
in
her
arms
blushing
fitfully
and
with
her
lip
trembling
in
a
motion
which
she
tried
to
exhibit
as
a
smile
would
tilly
say
if
she
knew
said
the
miller
slily
indeed
and
it
is
wrong
of
him
anne
instantly
cried
tears
running
down
her
face
as
she
threw
the
parcel
of
ribbons
on
the
floor
better
bestow
your
gifts
where
you
bestow
your
l
l
love
loveday
that
what
i
say
and
anne
turned
her
back
and
went
away
take
them
for
her
said
garland
quickly
picking
up
the
parcel
that
a
pity
said
bob
looking
regretfully
after
anne
remember
that
she
was
a
sort
of
girl
at
all
tell
her
garland
that
i
ask
her
pardon
but
of
course
i
did
know
she
was
too
proud
to
accept
a
little
present
how
should
i
upon
my
life
if
it
was
for
matilda
i
well
that
ca
be
of
course
this
said
garland
touching
with
her
foot
a
large
package
that
had
been
laid
down
by
bob
unseen
a
bit
of
baccy
for
myself
said
robert
meekly
the
examination
of
presents
at
last
ended
and
the
two
families
parted
for
the
night
when
they
were
alone
garland
said
to
anne
a
close
girl
you
are
i
am
sure
i
never
knew
that
bob
loveday
and
you
had
walked
together
you
must
have
been
mere
children
yes
so
we
were
said
anne
now
quite
recovered
was
when
we
first
came
here
about
a
year
after
father
died
we
did
not
walk
together
in
any
regular
way
you
know
i
have
never
thought
the
lovedays
high
enough
for
me
it
was
only
just
nothing
at
all
and
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
somebody
sins
were
forgiven
her
that
night
before
she
went
to
bed
when
bob
and
his
father
were
left
alone
the
miller
said
robert
about
this
young
woman
of
thine
matilda
what
her
name
father
matilda
johnson
i
was
just
going
to
tell
ye
about
her
the
miller
nodded
and
sipped
his
mug
she
is
an
excellent
body
continued
bob
can
truly
be
said
a
real
charmer
you
know
a
nice
good
comely
young
woman
a
miracle
of
genteel
breeding
you
know
and
all
that
she
can
throw
her
hair
into
the
nicest
curls
and
she
got
splendid
gowns
and
headclothes
in
short
you
might
call
her
a
land
mermaid
she
make
such
a
wife
as
there
never
was
doubt
she
will
said
the
miller
i
have
never
known
thee
wanting
in
sense
in
a
jineral
way
he
turned
his
cup
round
on
its
axis
till
the
handle
had
travelled
a
complete
circle
long
did
you
say
in
your
letter
that
you
had
known
her
fortnight
long
do
sound
long
is
true
and
was
really
longer
was
fifteen
days
and
a
quarter
but
hang
it
father
i
could
see
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
that
the
girl
would
do
i
know
a
woman
well
enough
when
i
see
her
i
ought
to
indeed
having
been
so
much
about
the
world
now
for
instance
there
widow
garland
and
her
daughter
the
girl
is
a
nice
little
thing
but
the
old
woman
o
no
bob
shook
his
head
of
her
said
his
father
slightly
shifting
in
his
chair
she
she
i
mean
i
should
never
have
chose
her
you
know
she
of
a
nice
disposition
and
young
for
a
widow
with
a
daughter
but
if
all
the
men
had
been
like
me
she
would
never
have
had
a
husband
i
like
her
in
some
respects
but
she
a
style
of
beauty
i
do
care
for
if
is
only
looks
you
are
thinking
of
said
the
miller
much
relieved
nothing
to
be
said
of
course
though
there
many
a
duchess
if
it
comes
to
argument
as
you
would
find
my
son
he
added
with
a
sense
of
having
been
mollified
too
soon
the
mate
thoughts
were
elsewhere
by
this
time
to
my
marrying
matilda
thinks
i
here
one
of
the
very
genteelest
sort
and
i
may
as
well
do
the
job
at
once
so
i
chose
her
she
a
dear
girl
there
nobody
like
her
search
where
you
will
many
did
you
choose
her
out
from
inquired
his
father
she
was
the
only
young
woman
i
happened
to
know
in
southampton
that
true
but
what
of
that
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
if
i
had
known
a
hundred
father
is
in
business
near
the
docks
i
suppose
no
in
short
i
did
see
her
father
mother
mother
no
i
did
i
think
her
mother
is
dead
but
she
has
got
a
very
rich
aunt
living
at
melchester
i
did
see
her
aunt
because
there
was
time
to
go
but
of
course
we
shall
know
her
when
we
are
married
yes
of
course
said
the
miller
trying
to
feel
quite
satisfied
she
will
soon
be
here
she
coming
soon
said
bob
has
gone
to
this
aunt
at
melchester
to
get
her
things
packed
and
suchlike
or
she
would
have
come
with
me
i
am
going
to
meet
the
coach
at
the
king
arms
casterbridge
on
sunday
at
one
to
show
what
a
capital
sort
of
wife
be
i
may
tell
you
that
she
wanted
to
come
by
the
mercury
because
is
a
little
cheaper
than
the
other
but
i
said
for
once
in
your
life
do
it
well
and
come
by
the
royal
mail
and
i
pay
i
can
have
the
pony
and
trap
to
fetch
her
i
suppose
as
is
too
far
for
her
to
walk
course
you
can
bob
or
anything
else
and
i
do
all
i
can
to
give
you
a
good
wedding
feast
xvi
they
make
ready
for
the
illustrious
stranger
preparations
for
matilda
welcome
and
for
the
event
which
was
to
follow
at
once
occupied
the
attention
of
the
mill
the
miller
and
his
man
had
but
dim
notions
of
housewifery
on
any
large
scale
so
the
great
wedding
cleaning
was
kindly
supervised
by
garland
bob
being
mostly
away
during
the
day
with
his
brother
the
on
various
errands
one
of
which
was
to
buy
paint
and
varnish
for
the
gig
that
matilda
was
to
be
fetched
in
which
he
had
determined
to
decorate
with
his
own
hands
by
the
widow
direction
the
old
familiar
incrustation
of
shining
dirt
imprinted
along
the
back
of
the
settle
by
the
heads
of
countless
jolly
sitters
was
scrubbed
and
scraped
away
the
brown
circle
round
the
nail
whereon
the
miller
hung
his
hat
stained
by
the
brim
in
wet
weather
was
whitened
over
the
tawny
smudges
of
bygone
shoulders
in
the
passage
were
removed
without
regard
to
a
certain
genial
and
historical
value
which
they
had
acquired
the
face
of
the
clock
coated
with
verdigris
as
thick
as
a
diachylon
plaister
was
rubbed
till
the
figures
emerged
into
day
while
inside
the
case
of
the
same
chronometer
the
cobwebs
that
formed
triangular
hammocks
which
the
pendulum
could
hardly
wade
through
were
cleared
away
at
one
swoop
garland
also
assisted
at
the
invasion
of
cupboards
where
layers
of
ancient
smells
lingered
on
in
the
stagnant
air
and
recalled
to
the
reflective
nose
the
many
good
things
that
had
been
kept
there
the
upper
floors
were
scrubbed
with
such
abundance
of
water
that
the
and
were
all
drowned
the
suds
trickling
down
into
the
room
below
in
so
lively
and
novel
a
manner
as
to
convey
the
romantic
notion
that
the
miller
lived
in
a
cave
with
dripping
stalactites
they
moved
what
had
never
been
moved
before
the
oak
coffer
containing
the
miller
wardrobe
a
tremendous
weight
what
with
its
locks
hinges
nails
dirt
framework
and
the
hard
stratification
of
old
jackets
waistcoats
and
at
the
bottom
never
disturbed
since
the
miller
wife
died
and
half
pulverized
by
the
moths
whose
flattened
skeletons
lay
amid
the
mass
in
thousands
fairly
makes
my
back
open
and
shut
said
loveday
as
in
obedience
to
garland
direction
he
lifted
one
corner
the
grinder
and
david
assisting
at
the
others
together
speak
when
ye
be
going
to
heave
now
the
pot
covers
and
skimmers
were
brought
to
such
a
state
that
on
examining
them
the
beholder
was
not
conscious
of
utensils
but
of
his
own
face
in
a
condition
of
hideous
elasticity
the
broken
was
mended
the
kettles
rocked
the
creeper
nailed
up
and
a
new
handle
put
to
the
the
large
household
lantern
was
cleaned
out
after
three
years
of
uninterrupted
accumulation
the
operation
yielding
a
conglomerate
of
remains
of
matches
and
eleven
ounces
and
a
half
of
good
grease
invaluable
as
dubbing
for
skitty
boots
and
ointment
for
everybody
said
that
the
mill
residence
had
not
been
so
thoroughly
scoured
for
twenty
years
the
miller
and
david
looked
on
with
a
sort
of
awe
tempered
by
gratitude
tacitly
admitting
by
their
gaze
that
this
was
beyond
what
they
had
ever
thought
of
garland
supervised
all
with
disinterested
benevolence
it
would
never
have
done
she
said
for
his
future
to
see
the
house
in
its
original
state
she
would
have
taken
a
dislike
to
him
and
perhaps
to
bob
likewise
do
ye
come
and
live
here
with
me
and
then
you
would
be
able
to
see
to
it
at
all
times
said
the
miller
as
she
bustled
about
again
to
which
she
answered
that
she
was
considering
the
matter
and
might
in
good
time
he
had
previously
informed
her
that
his
plan
was
to
put
bob
and
his
wife
in
the
part
of
the
house
that
she
garland
occupied
as
soon
as
she
chose
to
enter
his
which
relieved
her
of
any
fear
of
being
incommoded
by
matilda
the
cooking
for
the
wedding
festivities
was
on
a
proportionate
scale
of
thoroughness
they
killed
the
four
supernumerary
chickens
that
had
just
begun
to
crow
and
the
little
barrow
pig
in
preference
to
the
sow
not
having
been
put
up
fattening
for
more
than
five
weeks
it
was
excellent
small
meat
and
therefore
more
delicate
and
likely
to
suit
a
lady
taste
than
the
large
one
which
having
reached
the
weight
of
fourteen
score
might
have
been
a
little
gross
to
a
cultured
palate
there
were
also
provided
a
cold
chine
stuffed
veal
and
two
pigeon
pies
also
thirty
rings
of
a
dozen
of
and
ten
knots
of
tender
and
chitterlings
cooked
plain
in
case
she
should
like
a
change
as
additional
reserves
there
were
sweetbreads
and
five
milts
sewed
up
at
one
side
in
the
form
of
a
chrysalis
and
stuffed
with
thyme
sage
parsley
mint
groats
rice
milk
chopped
egg
and
other
ingredients
they
were
afterwards
roasted
before
a
slow
fire
and
eaten
hot
the
business
of
chopping
so
many
herbs
for
the
various
stuffings
was
found
to
be
aching
work
for
women
and
david
the
miller
the
grinder
and
the
grinder
boy
being
fully
occupied
in
their
proper
branches
and
bob
being
very
busy
painting
the
gig
and
touching
up
the
harness
loveday
called
in
a
friendly
dragoon
of
john
regiment
who
was
passing
by
and
he
being
a
muscular
man
willingly
chopped
all
the
afternoon
for
a
quart
of
strong
judiciously
administered
and
all
other
victuals
found
taking
off
his
jacket
and
gloves
rolling
up
his
and
unfastening
his
collar
in
an
honourable
and
energetic
way
all
windfalls
and
codlins
were
excluded
from
the
apple
pies
and
as
there
was
no
known
dish
large
enough
for
the
purpose
the
puddings
were
stirred
up
in
the
and
boiled
in
the
metal
crock
of
great
weight
and
antiquity
which
every
travelling
tinker
for
the
previous
thirty
years
had
tapped
with
his
stick
coveted
made
a
bid
for
and
often
attempted
to
steal
in
the
liquor
line
loveday
laid
in
an
ample
barrel
of
casterbridge
beer
this
renowned
drink
now
almost
as
much
a
thing
of
the
past
as
falstaff
favourite
beverage
was
not
only
well
calculated
to
win
the
hearts
of
soldiers
blown
dry
and
dusty
by
residence
in
tents
on
a
but
of
any
wayfarer
whatever
in
that
land
it
was
of
the
most
beautiful
colour
that
the
eye
of
an
artist
in
beer
could
desire
full
in
body
yet
brisk
as
a
volcano
piquant
yet
without
a
twang
luminous
as
an
autumn
sunset
free
from
streakiness
of
taste
but
finally
rather
heady
the
masses
worshipped
it
the
minor
gentry
loved
it
more
than
wine
and
by
the
most
illustrious
county
families
it
was
not
despised
anybody
brought
up
for
being
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
streets
of
its
natal
borough
had
only
to
prove
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
place
and
its
liquor
to
be
honourably
dismissed
by
the
magistrates
as
one
overtaken
in
a
fault
that
no
man
could
guard
against
who
entered
the
town
unawares
in
addition
loveday
also
tapped
a
hogshead
of
fine
cider
that
he
had
had
mellowing
in
the
house
for
several
months
having
bought
it
of
an
honest
man
who
did
not
colour
for
any
special
occasion
like
the
present
it
had
been
pressed
from
fruit
judiciously
chosen
by
an
old
hand
horner
and
cleeves
apple
for
the
body
a
few
for
colour
and
just
a
dash
of
old
for
sparkle
a
selection
originally
made
to
please
the
palate
of
a
temperate
earl
who
was
a
regular
and
lived
to
be
on
the
morning
of
the
sunday
appointed
for
her
coming
captain
bob
loveday
set
out
to
meet
his
bride
he
had
been
all
the
week
engaged
in
painting
the
gig
assisted
by
his
brother
at
odd
times
and
it
now
appeared
of
a
gorgeous
yellow
with
blue
streaks
and
tassels
at
the
corners
and
red
wheels
outlined
with
a
darker
shade
he
put
in
the
pony
at
eleven
anne
looking
at
him
from
the
door
as
he
packed
himself
into
the
vehicle
and
drove
off
there
may
be
young
women
who
look
out
at
young
men
driving
to
meet
their
brides
as
anne
looked
at
captain
bob
and
yet
are
quite
indifferent
to
the
circumstances
but
they
are
not
often
met
with
so
much
dust
had
been
raised
on
the
highway
by
traffic
resulting
from
the
presence
of
the
court
at
the
town
further
on
that
brambles
hanging
from
the
fence
and
giving
a
friendly
scratch
to
the
wanderer
face
were
dingy
as
church
cobwebs
and
the
grass
on
the
margin
had
assumed
a
shaving
hue
bob
father
had
wished
him
to
take
david
lest
from
want
of
recent
experience
at
the
whip
he
should
meet
with
any
mishap
but
picturing
to
himself
the
awkwardness
of
three
in
such
circumstances
bob
would
not
hear
of
this
and
nothing
more
serious
happened
to
his
driving
than
that
the
formed
two
serpentine
lines
along
the
road
during
the
first
mile
or
two
before
he
had
got
his
hand
in
and
that
the
horse
shied
at
a
milestone
a
piece
of
paper
a
sleeping
tramp
and
a
wheelbarrow
just
to
make
use
of
the
opportunity
of
being
in
bad
hands
he
entered
casterbridge
between
twelve
and
one
and
putting
up
at
the
old
greyhound
walked
on
to
the
bow
here
rather
dusty
on
the
ledges
of
his
clothes
he
stood
and
waited
while
the
people
in
their
best
summer
dresses
poured
out
of
the
three
churches
round
him
when
they
had
all
gone
and
a
smell
of
cinders
and
gravy
had
spread
down
the
ancient
street
and
the
from
adjacent
bakehouses
had
all
travelled
past
he
saw
the
mail
coach
rise
above
the
arch
of
grey
bridge
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
surmounted
by
swaying
knobs
which
proved
to
be
the
heads
of
the
outside
travellers
the
way
for
a
man
bride
to
come
to
him
said
robert
to
himself
with
a
feeling
of
poetry
and
as
the
horn
sounded
and
the
horses
clattered
up
the
street
he
walked
down
to
the
inn
the
knot
of
hostlers
and
had
gathered
the
horses
were
dragged
from
the
vehicle
and
the
passengers
for
casterbridge
began
to
descend
captain
bob
eyed
them
over
looked
inside
looked
outside
again
to
his
disappointment
matilda
was
not
there
nor
her
boxes
nor
anything
that
was
hers
neither
coachman
nor
guard
had
seen
or
heard
of
such
a
person
at
melchester
and
bob
walked
slowly
away
depressed
by
forebodings
to
an
extent
which
took
away
nearly
a
third
of
his
appetite
he
sat
down
in
the
parlour
of
the
old
greyhound
to
a
slice
from
the
family
joint
of
the
landlord
this
gentleman
who
dined
in
his
partly
because
it
was
august
and
partly
from
a
sense
that
they
would
not
be
so
fit
for
public
view
further
on
in
the
week
suggested
that
bob
should
wait
till
three
or
four
that
afternoon
when
the
would
arrive
as
the
lost
lady
might
have
preferred
that
mode
of
conveyance
and
when
bob
appeared
rather
hurt
at
the
suggestion
the
landlord
wife
assured
him
as
a
woman
who
knew
good
life
that
many
genteel
persons
travelled
in
that
way
during
the
present
high
price
of
provisions
loveday
who
knew
little
of
travelling
by
land
readily
accepted
her
assurance
and
resolved
to
wait
wandering
up
and
down
the
pavement
or
leaning
against
some
hot
wall
between
the
and
the
corner
of
the
street
above
he
passed
the
time
away
it
was
a
still
sunny
drowsy
afternoon
and
scarcely
a
soul
was
visible
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
street
the
office
was
not
far
from
all
saints
church
and
the
being
open
he
could
hear
the
afternoon
service
from
where
he
lingered
as
distinctly
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
congregation
thus
he
was
mentally
conducted
through
the
psalms
through
the
first
and
second
lessons
through
the
burst
of
fiddles
and
clarionets
which
announced
the
and
well
into
the
sermon
before
any
signs
of
the
waggon
could
be
seen
upon
the
london
road
the
afternoon
sermons
at
this
church
being
of
a
dry
and
metaphysical
nature
at
that
date
it
was
by
a
special
providence
that
the
was
placed
near
the
ancient
fabric
so
that
whenever
the
sunday
waggon
was
late
which
it
always
was
in
hot
weather
in
cold
weather
in
wet
weather
and
in
weather
of
almost
every
other
sort
the
rattle
dismounting
and
swearing
outside
completely
drowned
the
voice
within
and
sustained
the
flagging
interest
of
the
congregation
at
precisely
the
right
moment
no
sooner
did
the
charity
children
begin
to
writhe
on
their
benches
and
adult
snores
grow
audible
than
the
waggon
arrived
captain
loveday
felt
a
kind
of
sinking
in
his
poetry
at
the
possibility
of
her
for
whom
they
had
made
such
preparations
being
in
the
slow
unwieldy
vehicle
which
crunched
its
way
towards
him
but
he
would
not
give
in
to
the
weakness
neither
would
he
walk
down
the
street
to
meet
the
waggon
lest
she
should
not
be
there
at
last
the
broad
wheels
drew
up
against
the
kerb
the
waggoner
with
his
white
and
whip
as
long
as
a
descended
from
the
pony
on
which
he
rode
alongside
and
the
six
horses
backed
from
their
collars
and
shook
themselves
in
another
moment
something
showed
forth
and
he
knew
that
matilda
was
there
bob
felt
three
cheers
rise
within
him
as
she
stepped
down
but
it
being
sunday
he
did
not
utter
them
in
dress
miss
johnson
passed
his
expectations
a
green
and
white
gown
with
long
tight
sleeves
a
green
silk
handkerchief
round
her
neck
and
crossed
in
front
a
green
parasol
and
green
gloves
it
was
strange
enough
to
see
this
verdant
caterpillar
turn
out
of
a
and
gracefully
shake
herself
free
from
the
bits
of
straw
and
fluff
which
would
usually
gather
on
the
raiment
of
the
grandest
travellers
by
that
vehicle
my
dear
matilda
said
bob
when
he
had
kissed
her
three
times
with
much
publicity
the
practical
step
he
had
determined
on
seeming
to
demand
that
these
things
should
no
longer
be
done
in
a
corner
dear
matilda
why
did
you
come
by
the
coach
having
the
money
and
all
my
scrimping
said
matilda
in
a
delightful
gush
know
you
wo
be
offended
when
you
know
i
did
it
to
save
against
a
rainy
day
bob
of
course
was
not
offended
though
the
glory
of
meeting
her
had
been
less
and
even
if
vexation
were
possible
it
would
have
been
out
of
place
to
say
so
still
he
would
have
experienced
no
little
surprise
had
he
learnt
the
real
reason
of
his
matilda
change
of
plan
that
angel
had
in
short
so
wildly
spent
bob
and
her
own
money
in
the
adornment
of
her
person
before
setting
out
that
she
found
herself
without
a
sufficient
margin
for
her
fare
by
coach
and
had
scrimped
from
sheer
necessity
i
have
got
the
trap
out
at
the
greyhound
said
bob
know
whether
it
will
hold
your
luggage
and
us
too
but
it
looked
more
respectable
than
the
waggon
on
a
sunday
and
if
there
not
room
for
the
boxes
i
can
walk
alongside
think
there
will
be
room
said
miss
johnson
mildly
and
it
was
soon
very
evident
that
she
spoke
the
truth
for
when
her
property
was
deposited
on
the
pavement
it
consisted
of
a
trunk
about
eighteen
inches
long
and
nothing
more
that
all
said
captain
loveday
surprised
all
said
the
young
woman
assuringly
did
want
to
give
trouble
you
know
and
what
i
have
besides
i
have
left
at
my
aunt
of
course
he
answered
readily
as
it
no
bigger
i
can
carry
it
in
my
hand
to
the
inn
and
so
it
will
be
no
trouble
at
all
he
caught
up
the
little
box
and
they
went
side
by
side
to
the
greyhound
and
in
ten
minutes
they
were
trotting
up
the
southern
road
bob
did
not
hurry
the
horse
there
being
many
things
to
say
and
hear
for
which
the
present
situation
was
admirably
suited
the
sun
shone
occasionally
into
matilda
face
as
they
drove
on
its
rays
picking
out
all
her
features
to
a
great
nicety
her
eyes
would
have
been
called
brown
but
they
were
really
like
many
other
nice
brown
eyes
they
were
and
rather
bright
though
they
had
more
of
a
broad
shine
than
a
sparkle
she
had
a
firm
sufficient
nose
which
seemed
to
say
of
itself
that
it
was
good
as
noses
go
she
had
rather
a
picturesque
way
of
wrapping
her
upper
in
her
lower
lip
so
that
the
red
of
the
latter
showed
strongly
whenever
she
gazed
against
the
sun
towards
the
distant
hills
she
brought
into
her
forehead
without
knowing
it
three
short
vertical
lines
not
there
at
other
times
giving
her
for
the
moment
rather
a
hard
look
and
in
turning
her
head
round
to
a
far
angle
to
stare
at
something
or
other
that
he
pointed
out
the
drawn
flesh
of
her
neck
became
a
mass
of
lines
but
bob
did
not
look
at
these
things
which
of
course
were
of
no
significance
for
had
she
not
told
him
when
they
compared
ages
that
she
was
a
little
over
as
nature
was
hardly
invented
at
this
early
point
of
the
century
matilda
could
not
say
much
about
the
glamour
of
the
hills
or
the
shimmering
of
the
foliage
or
the
wealth
of
glory
in
the
distant
sea
as
she
would
doubtless
have
done
had
she
lived
later
on
but
she
did
her
best
to
be
interesting
asking
bob
about
matters
of
social
interest
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
she
seemed
quite
a
stranger
your
a
large
city
she
inquired
when
they
mounted
the
hill
where
the
overcombe
folk
had
waited
for
the
king
you
my
dear
no
be
nothing
if
it
was
for
the
royal
family
and
the
lords
and
ladies
and
the
regiments
of
soldiers
and
the
frigates
and
the
king
messengers
and
the
actors
and
actresses
and
the
games
that
go
on
at
the
words
and
actresses
the
innocent
young
thing
pricked
up
her
ears
elliston
pay
as
good
salaries
this
summer
as
in
you
know
about
it
then
i
thought
no
no
i
have
heard
of
budmouth
read
in
the
papers
you
know
dear
robert
about
the
doings
there
and
the
actors
and
actresses
you
know
yes
i
see
well
i
have
been
away
from
england
a
long
time
and
do
know
much
about
the
theatre
in
the
town
but
i
take
you
there
some
day
would
it
be
a
treat
to
you
an
amazing
treat
said
miss
johnson
with
an
ecstasy
in
which
a
close
observer
might
have
discovered
a
tinge
of
ghastliness
never
been
into
one
perhaps
dear
never
said
matilda
flatly
do
i
see
yonder
a
row
of
white
things
on
the
down
that
a
part
of
the
encampment
above
overcombe
lots
of
soldiers
are
encamped
about
here
those
are
the
white
tops
of
their
tents
he
pointed
to
a
wing
of
the
camp
that
had
become
visible
matilda
was
much
interested
will
make
it
very
lively
for
us
he
added
as
john
is
there
she
thought
so
too
and
thus
they
chatted
on
xvii
two
fainting
fits
and
a
bewilderment
meanwhile
miller
loveday
was
expecting
the
pair
with
interest
and
about
five
after
repeated
outlooks
he
saw
two
specks
the
size
of
caraway
seeds
on
the
far
line
of
ridge
where
the
sunlit
white
of
the
road
met
the
blue
of
the
sky
then
the
remainder
parts
of
bob
and
his
lady
became
visible
and
then
the
whole
vehicle
end
on
and
he
heard
the
dry
rattle
of
the
wheels
on
the
dusty
road
miller
loveday
plan
as
far
as
he
had
formed
any
was
that
robert
and
his
wife
should
live
with
him
in
the
millhouse
until
garland
made
up
her
mind
to
join
him
there
in
which
event
her
present
house
would
be
made
over
to
the
young
couple
upon
all
grounds
he
wished
to
welcome
becomingly
the
woman
of
his
choice
and
came
forward
promptly
as
they
drew
up
at
the
door
a
lovely
place
you
got
here
said
miss
johnson
when
the
miller
had
received
her
from
the
captain
real
stream
of
water
a
real
wheel
and
real
fowls
and
everything
is
real
enough
said
loveday
looking
at
the
river
with
balanced
sentiments
so
you
will
say
when
you
lived
here
a
bit
as
and
had
the
trouble
of
claning
the
furniture
at
this
miss
johnson
looked
modest
and
continued
to
do
so
till
anne
not
knowing
they
were
there
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
with
her
in
her
hand
having
just
arrived
from
church
bob
turned
and
smiled
to
her
at
which
miss
johnson
looked
glum
how
long
she
would
have
remained
in
that
phase
is
unknown
for
just
then
her
ears
were
assailed
by
a
loud
bass
note
from
the
other
side
causing
her
to
jump
round
la
what
dreadful
thing
is
it
she
exclaimed
and
beheld
a
cow
of
loveday
of
the
name
of
crumpler
standing
close
to
her
shoulder
it
being
about
she
had
come
to
look
up
david
and
hasten
on
the
operation
what
a
horrid
bull
it
did
frighten
me
so
i
hope
i
sha
faint
said
matilda
the
miller
immediately
used
the
formula
which
has
been
uttered
by
the
proprietors
of
live
stock
ever
since
noah
time
wo
hurt
ye
hoosh
crumpler
she
as
timid
as
a
mouse
but
as
crumpler
persisted
in
making
another
terrific
inquiry
for
david
matilda
could
not
help
closing
her
eyes
and
saying
i
shall
be
gored
to
death
her
head
falling
back
upon
bob
shoulder
which
seeing
the
urgent
circumstances
and
knowing
her
delicate
nature
he
had
providentially
placed
in
a
position
to
catch
her
anne
garland
who
had
been
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
house
not
knowing
whether
to
go
back
or
come
on
at
this
felt
her
womanly
sympathies
aroused
she
ran
and
dipped
her
handkerchief
into
the
splashing
and
with
it
damped
matilda
face
but
as
her
eyes
still
remained
closed
bob
to
increase
the
effect
took
the
handkerchief
from
anne
and
wrung
it
out
on
the
bridge
of
matilda
nose
whence
it
ran
over
the
rest
of
her
face
in
a
stream
captain
loveday
said
anne
water
is
running
over
her
green
silk
handkerchief
and
into
her
pretty
reticule
if
i
did
think
so
exclaimed
matilda
opening
her
eyes
starting
up
and
promptly
pulling
out
her
own
handkerchief
with
which
she
wiped
away
the
drops
and
an
unimportant
trifle
of
her
complexion
assisted
by
anne
who
in
spite
of
her
background
of
antagonistic
emotions
could
not
help
being
interested

said
the
miller
his
spirits
reviving
with
the
revival
of
matilda
lady
is
not
used
to
country
life
are
you
am
not
replied
the
sufferer
is
so
strange
about
here
suddenly
there
spread
into
the
firmament
from
the
direction
of
the
down
ta

ra

dear
dear
more
hideous
country
sounds
i
suppose
she
inquired
with
another
start
no
said
the
miller
cheerfully
only
my
son
john
trumpeter
chaps
at
the
camp
of
dragoons
just
above
us
mess
or
feed
or
picket
or
some
other
of
their
vagaries
john
will
be
much
pleased
to
tell
you
the
meaning
o
when
he
comes
down
he
as
you
may
know
yes
you
mean
captain
loveday
brother
dear
bob
has
mentioned
him
you
come
round
to
widow
garland
side
of
the
house
you
can
see
the
camp
said
the
miller
force
her
she
tired
with
her
long
journey
said
garland
humanely
the
widow
having
come
out
in
the
general
wish
to
see
captain
bob
choice
indeed
they
all
behaved
towards
her
as
if
she
were
a
tender
exotic
which
their
crude
country
manners
might
seriously
injure
she
went
into
the
house
accompanied
by
garland
and
her
daughter
though
before
leaving
bob
she
managed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
tell
them
i
came
by
waggon
will
you
dear
a
request
which
was
quite
needless
for
bob
had
long
ago
determined
to
keep
that
a
dead
secret
not
because
it
was
an
uncommon
mode
of
travel
but
simply
that
it
was
hardly
the
usual
conveyance
for
a
gorgeous
lady
to
her
bridal
as
the
men
had
a
feeling
that
they
would
be
superfluous
indoors
just
at
present
the
miller
assisted
david
in
taking
the
horse
round
to
the
stables
bob
following
and
leaving
matilda
to
the
women
indoors
miss
johnson
admired
everything
the
new
parrots
and
marmosets
the
black
beams
of
the
ceiling
the
cupboard
with
the
glass
doors
through
which
gleamed
the
remainders
of
sundry
china
sets
acquired
by
bob
mother
in
her
housekeeping
a
like
a
pagoda
and
a
in
the
form
of
a
spotted
cow
this
sociability
in
their
visitor
was
returned
by
garland
and
anne
and
miss
johnson
pleasing
habit
of
partly
dying
whenever
she
heard
any
unusual
bark
or
bellow
added
to
her
piquancy
in
their
eyes
but
conversation
as
such
was
naturally
at
first
of
a
nervous
tentative
kind
in
which
as
in
the
works
of
some
minor
poets
the
sense
was
considerably
led
by
the
sound
get
the
here
no
doubt
yes
dear
when
the
wind
is
that
way
you
like
windy
weather
though
not
now
for
it
blows
down
the
young
apples
are
plentiful
it
seems
you
call
their
christening
day
if
it
rains
dear
ah
me
i
have
not
been
to
a
christening
for
these
many
years
the
baby
name
was
george
i
remember
after
the
king
hear
that
king
george
is
still
staying
at
the
town
here
i
he
stay
till
i
have
seen
him
wait
till
the
corn
turns
yellow
he
always
does
fashionable
yellow
is
getting
for
gloves
just
now
some
persons
wear
them
to
the
elbow
i
hear
they
i
was
not
aware
of
that
i
struck
my
elbow
last
week
so
hard
against
the
door
of
my
aunt
mansion
that
i
feel
the
ache
now
before
they
were
quite
overwhelmed
by
the
interest
of
this
discourse
the
miller
and
bob
came
in
in
truth
garland
found
the
office
in
which
he
had
placed
her
that
of
introducing
a
strange
woman
to
a
house
which
was
not
the
widow
own
a
rather
awkward
one
and
yet
almost
a
necessity
there
was
no
woman
belonging
to
the
house
except
that
wondrous
compendium
of
usefulness
the
intermittent
whom
loveday
had
for
appearances
borrowed
from
garland
and
garland
was
in
the
habit
of
borrowing
from
the
girl
mother
and
as
for
the
david
he
had
been
informed
as
peremptorily
as
baker
that
the
office
of
housemaid
and
bedmaker
was
taken
from
him
and
would
be
given
to
this
girl
till
the
wedding
was
over
and
bob
wife
took
the
management
into
her
own
hands
they
all
sat
down
to
high
tea
anne
and
her
mother
included
and
the
captain
sitting
next
to
miss
johnson
anne
had
put
a
brave
face
upon
the
matter
outwardly
at
least
and
seemed
in
a
fair
way
of
subduing
any
lingering
sentiment
which
bob
return
had
revived
during
the
evening
and
while
they
still
sat
over
the
meal
john
came
down
on
a
hurried
visit
as
he
had
promised
ostensibly
on
purpose
to
be
introduced
to
his
intended
but
much
more
to
get
a
word
and
a
smile
from
his
beloved
anne
before
they
saw
him
they
heard
the
smart
step
coming
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
in
a
moment
his
form
darkened
the
door
as
it
was
sunday
he
appeared
in
his
laced
coat
white
waistcoat
and
breeches
and
towering
plume
the
latter
of
which
he
instantly
lowered
as
much
from
necessity
as
good
manners
the
beam
in
the
ceiling
having
a
tendency
to
smash
and
ruin
all
such
without
warning
we
been
hoping
you
would
come
down
said
the
miller
so
we
have
kept
the
tay
about
on
purpose
draw
up
and
speak
to
matilda
johnson
this
is
robert
brother
humble
servant
said
the
gallantly
as
it
was
getting
dusk
in
the
low
room
he
instinctively
moved
towards
miss
johnson
as
he
spoke
who
sat
with
her
back
to
the
window
he
had
no
sooner
noticed
her
features
than
his
helmet
nearly
fell
from
his
hand
his
face
became
suddenly
fixed
and
his
natural
complexion
took
itself
off
leaving
a
greenish
yellow
in
its
stead
the
young
person
on
her
part
had
no
sooner
looked
closely
at
him
than
she
said
weakly
brother
and
changed
colour
yet
more
rapidly
than
the
soldier
had
done
the
faintness
previously
half
counterfeit
seized
on
her
now
in
real
earnest
do
feel
well
she
said
suddenly
rising
by
an
effort
warm
day
has
quite
upset
me
there
was
a
regular
collapse
of
the
like
that
of
the
hamlet
play
scene
bob
seized
his
sweetheart
and
carried
her
upstairs
the
miller
exclaiming
she
terribly
worn
by
the
journey
i
thought
she
was
when
i
saw
her
nearly
go
off
at
the
blare
of
the
cow
no
woman
would
have
been
frightened
at
that
if
she
been
up
to
her
natural
strength
and
being
so
very
shy
of
men
too
must
have
made
john
handsome
regimentals
quite
overpowering
to
her
poor
thing
added
garland
following
the
catastrophic
young
lady
upstairs
whose
indisposition
was
this
time
beyond
question
and
yet
by
some
perversity
of
the
heart
she
was
as
eager
now
to
make
light
of
her
faintness
as
she
had
been
to
make
much
of
it
two
or
three
hours
ago
the
miller
and
john
stood
like
straight
sticks
in
the
room
the
others
had
quitted
john
face
being
hastily
turned
towards
a
caricature
of
buonaparte
on
the
wall
that
he
had
not
seen
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
times
before
sit
down
and
have
a
dish
of
tea
anyhow
said
his
father
at
last
soon
be
right
again
no
doubt
i
do
want
any
tea
said
john
quickly
and
indeed
he
did
not
for
he
was
in
one
gigantic
ache
from
head
to
foot
the
light
had
been
too
dim
for
anybody
to
notice
his
amazement
and
not
knowing
where
to
vent
it
the
said
he
was
going
out
for
a
minute
he
hastened
to
the
bakehouse
but
david
being
there
he
went
to
the
pantry
but
the
maid
being
there
he
went
to
the
but
a
couple
of
tramps
being
there
he
went
behind
a
row
of
french
beans
in
the
garden
where
he
let
off
an
ejaculation
the
most
pious
that
he
had
uttered
that
sabbath
day
what
to
be
done
and
then
he
walked
wildly
about
the
paths
of
the
dusky
garden
where
the
trickling
of
the
brooks
seemed
loud
by
comparison
with
the
stillness
around
treading
recklessly
on
the
cracking
snails
that
had
come
forth
to
feed
and
entangling
his
spurs
in
the
long
grass
till
the
rowels
were
choked
with
its
blades
presently
he
heard
another
person
approaching
and
his
brother
shape
appeared
between
the
stubbard
tree
and
the
hedge
is
it
you
said
the
mate
i
am
taking
a
little
air
is
getting
round
nicely
again
and
as
i
am
not
wanted
indoors
just
now
i
am
going
into
the
village
to
call
upon
a
friend
or
two
i
have
not
been
able
to
speak
to
as
yet
john
took
his
brother
bob
hand
bob
rather
wondered
why
right
old
boy
he
said
into
the
village
you
be
back
again
i
suppose
before
it
gets
very
late
yes
said
captain
bob
cheerfully
and
passed
out
of
the
garden
john
allowed
his
eyes
to
follow
his
brother
till
his
shape
could
not
be
seen
and
then
he
turned
and
again
walked
up
and
down
xviii
the
night
after
the
arrival
john
continued
his
sad
and
heavy
pace
till
walking
seemed
too
old
and
a
way
of
showing
sorrow
so
new
and
he
leant
himself
against
the
fork
of
an
like
a
log
there
the
remained
for
a
considerable
time
his
face
turned
towards
the
house
whose
ancient
chimneyed
outline
rose
against
the
darkened
sky
and
just
shut
out
from
his
view
the
camp
above
but
faint
noises
coming
thence
from
horses
restless
at
the
pickets
and
from
visitors
taking
their
leave
recalled
its
existence
and
reminded
him
that
in
consequence
of
arrival
he
had
obtained
leave
for
the
night
a
fact
which
owing
to
the
startling
emotions
that
followed
his
entry
he
had
not
yet
mentioned
to
his
friends
while
abstractedly
considering
how
he
could
best
use
that
privilege
under
the
new
circumstances
which
had
arisen
he
heard
farmer
derriman
drive
up
to
the
front
door
and
hold
a
conversation
with
his
father
the
old
man
had
at
last
apparently
brought
the
tin
box
of
private
papers
that
he
wished
the
miller
to
take
charge
of
during
derriman
absence
and
it
being
a
calm
night
john
could
hear
though
he
little
heeded
uncle
benjy
reiterated
supplications
to
loveday
to
keep
it
safe
from
fire
and
thieves
then
uncle
benjy
left
and
john
father
went
upstairs
to
deposit
the
box
in
a
place
of
security
the
whole
proceeding
reaching
john
preoccupied
comprehension
merely
as
voices
during
sleep
the
next
thing
was
the
appearance
of
a
light
in
the
bedroom
which
had
been
assigned
to
matilda
johnson
this
effectually
aroused
the
major
and
with
a
stealthiness
unusual
in
him
he
went
indoors
no
light
was
in
the
lower
rooms
his
father
garland
and
anne
having
gone
out
on
the
bridge
to
look
at
the
new
moon
john
went
upstairs
on
toe
and
along
the
uneven
passage
till
he
came
to
her
door
it
was
standing
ajar
a
band
of
candlelight
shining
across
the
passage
and
up
the
opposite
wall
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
radiance
he
saw
her
she
was
standing
before
the
apparently
lost
in
thought
her
fingers
being
clasped
behind
her
head
in
abstraction
and
the
light
falling
full
upon
her
face
must
speak
to
you
said
the
she
started
turned
and
grew
paler
than
before
and
then
as
if
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
she
swung
the
door
wide
open
and
coming
out
said
quite
collectedly
and
with
apparent
pleasantness
yes
you
are
my
bob
brother
i
did
for
a
moment
recognize
you
you
do
now
bob
brother
have
not
seen
me
before
have
not
she
answered
with
a
face
as
impassible
as
talleyrand
god
have
not
she
repeated
any
of
the
th
dragoons
captain
jolly
for
instance
mistake
i
remind
you
of
particulars
he
said
drily
and
he
did
remind
her
at
some
length
she
said
desperately
but
she
had
miscalculated
her
staying
powers
and
her
character
five
minutes
after
that
she
was
in
tears
and
the
conversation
had
resolved
itself
into
words
which
on
the
part
were
of
the
nature
of
commands
tempered
by
pity
and
were
a
mere
series
of
entreaties
on
hers
the
whole
scene
did
not
last
ten
minutes
when
it
was
over
the
major
walked
from
the
doorway
where
they
had
been
standing
and
brushed
moisture
from
his
eyes
reaching
a
dark
he
stood
still
there
to
calm
himself
and
then
descended
by
a
to
the
bakehouse
instead
of
by
the
front
stairs
he
found
that
the
others
including
bob
had
gathered
in
the
parlour
during
his
absence
and
lighted
the
candles
miss
johnson
having
sent
down
some
time
before
john
the
house
to
say
that
she
would
prefer
to
keep
her
room
that
evening
was
not
expected
to
join
them
and
on
this
account
bob
showed
less
than
his
customary
liveliness
the
miller
wishing
to
keep
up
his
son
spirits
expressed
his
regret
that
it
being
sunday
night
they
could
have
no
songs
to
make
the
evening
cheerful
when
garland
proposed
that
they
should
sing
psalms
which
by
choosing
lively
tunes
and
not
thinking
of
the
words
would
be
almost
as
good
as
ballads
this
they
did
the
appearing
to
join
in
with
the
rest
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
sound
came
from
his
moving
lips
his
mind
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
derived
no
pleasure
even
from
anne
presence
though
he
held
a
corner
of
the
same
book
with
her
and
was
treated
in
a
winsome
way
which
it
was
not
her
usual
practice
to
indulge
in
she
saw
that
his
mind
was
clouded
and
far
from
guessing
the
reason
why
was
doing
her
best
to
clear
it
at
length
the
garlands
found
that
it
was
the
hour
for
them
to
leave
and
john
loveday
at
the
same
time
wished
his
father
and
bob
and
went
as
far
as
garland
door
with
her
he
had
said
not
a
word
to
show
that
he
was
free
to
remain
out
of
camp
for
the
reason
that
there
was
painful
work
to
be
done
which
it
would
be
best
to
do
in
secret
and
alone
he
lingered
near
the
house
till
its
reflected
ceased
to
glimmer
upon
the
and
all
within
the
dwelling
was
dark
and
still
then
he
entered
the
garden
and
waited
there
till
the
back
door
opened
and
a
woman
figure
timorously
came
forward
john
loveday
at
once
went
up
to
her
and
they
began
to
talk
in
low
yet
dissentient
tones
they
had
conversed
about
ten
minutes
and
were
parting
as
if
they
had
come
to
some
painful
arrangement
miss
johnson
sobbing
bitterly
when
a
head
stealthily
arose
above
the
dense
hedgerow
and
in
a
moment
a
shout
burst
from
its
owner
thieves
my
tin
box
thieves
thieves
matilda
vanished
into
the
house
and
john
loveday
hastened
to
the
hedge
heaven
sake
hold
your
tongue
mr
derriman
he
exclaimed
tin
box
said
uncle
benjy
only
the
box
is
safe
enough
i
assure
you
it
was
only
here
the
major
gave
vent
to
an
artificial
laugh
a
sly
bit
of
courting
you
know
ha
i
see
said
the
relieved
old
squireen
miss
anne
then
you
ousted
my
nephew
well
so
much
the
better
as
for
myself
the
truth
o
is
that
i
have
been
able
to
go
to
bed
easy
for
thinking
that
possibly
your
father
might
not
take
care
of
what
i
put
under
his
charge
and
at
last
i
thought
i
would
just
step
over
and
see
if
all
was
safe
here
before
i
turned
in
and
when
i
saw
your
two
shapes
my
poor
nerves
magnified
ye
to
housebreakers
and
boneys
and
i
do
know
what
all
have
alarmed
the
house
said
the
hearing
the
clicking
of
flint
and
steel
in
his
father
bedroom
followed
in
a
moment
by
the
rise
of
a
light
in
the
window
of
the
same
apartment
have
got
me
into
difficulty
he
added
gloomily
as
his
father
opened
the
casement
am
sorry
for
that
said
uncle
benjy
step
back
i
put
it
all
right
again
for
heaven
sake
is
the
matter
said
the
miller
his
tasselled
nightcap
appearing
in
the
opening
nothing
said
the
farmer
was
uneasy
about
my
few
bonds
and
documents
and
i
walked
this
way
miller
before
going
to
bed
as
i
start
from
home
morning
when
i
came
down
by
your
i
thought
i
saw
thieves
but
it
turned
out
to
be
to
be
here
a
lump
of
earth
from
the
hand
struck
uncle
benjy
in
the
back
as
a
reminder
be
the
bough
of
a
in
the
wind
thieves
are
like
to
try
my
house
said
miller
loveday
you
come
alarming
us
like
this
again
farmer
or
you
shall
keep
your
box
yourself
begging
your
pardon
for
saying
so
t
ye
will
ye
just
look
since
i
am
here
just
look
and
see
if
the
box
is
all
right
there
a
good
man
i
am
old
you
know
and
my
poor
remains
are
not
what
my
original
self
was
look
and
see
if
it
is
where
you
put
it
there
a
good
kind
man
well
said
the
miller
loveday
on
second
thoughts
i
will
take
my
box
home
again
after
all
if
you
do
mind
you
wo
deem
it
ill
of
me
i
have
no
suspicion
of
course
but
now
i
think
o
there
rivalry
between
my
nephew
and
your
son
and
if
festus
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
set
your
house
on
fire
in
his
enmity
be
bad
for
my
deeds
and
documents
no
offence
miller
but
i
take
the
box
if
you
mind
i
do
mind
said
loveday
your
nephew
had
better
think
twice
before
he
lets
his
enmity
take
that
colour
receding
from
the
window
he
took
the
candle
to
a
back
part
of
the
room
and
soon
reappeared
with
the
tin
box
wo
trouble
ye
to
dress
said
derriman
considerately
en
down
by
anything
you
have
at
hand
the
box
was
lowered
by
a
cord
and
the
old
man
clasped
it
in
his
arms
ye
he
said
with
heartfelt
gratitude
the
miller
replied
and
closed
the
window
and
the
light
went
out
now
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
sir
said
the
quite
said
derriman
and
leaning
on
his
he
pursued
his
lonely
way
that
night
anne
lay
awake
in
her
bed
musing
on
the
traits
of
the
new
friend
who
had
come
to
her
neighbour
house
she
would
not
be
critical
it
was
ungenerous
and
wrong
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
what
interested
her
and
were
there
she
silently
asked
in
miss
mind
and
person
such
rare
qualities
as
placed
that
lady
altogether
beyond
comparison
with
herself
o
yes
there
must
be
for
had
not
captain
bob
singled
out
matilda
from
among
all
other
women
herself
included
of
course
with
his
experience
he
knew
best
when
the
moon
had
set
and
only
the
summer
stars
threw
their
light
into
the
great
damp
garden
she
fancied
that
she
heard
voices
in
that
direction
perhaps
they
were
the
voices
of
bob
and
matilda
taking
a
lover
walk
before
retiring
if
so
how
sleepy
they
would
be
next
day
and
how
absurd
it
was
of
matilda
to
pretend
she
was
tired
ruminating
in
this
way
and
saying
to
herself
that
she
hoped
they
would
be
happy
anne
fell
asleep
xix
miss
johnson
behaviour
causes
no
little
surprise
partly
from
the
excitement
of
having
his
matilda
under
the
paternal
roof
bob
rose
next
morning
as
early
as
his
father
and
the
grinder
and
when
the
big
wheel
began
to
patter
and
the
little
ones
to
mumble
in
response
went
to
sun
himself
outside
the
among
the
fowls
of
brown
and
speckled
kinds
which
haunted
that
spot
and
the
ducks
that
came
up
from
the
standing
on
the
inlaid
in
the
gravel
he
talked
with
his
father
on
various
improvements
of
the
premises
and
on
the
proposed
arrangements
for
his
permanent
residence
there
with
an
enjoyment
that
was
half
based
upon
this
prospect
of
the
future
and
half
on
the
penetrating
warmth
of
the
sun
to
his
back
and
shoulders
then
the
different
troops
of
horses
began
their
morning
scramble
down
to
the
pond
and
after
making
it
very
muddy
round
the
edge
ascended
the
slope
again
the
bustle
of
the
camp
grew
more
and
more
audible
and
presently
david
came
to
say
that
breakfast
was
ready
miss
johnson
downstairs
said
the
miller
and
bob
listened
for
the
answer
looking
at
a
blue
sentinel
aloft
on
the
down
yet
maister
said
the
excellent
david
wait
till
she
down
said
loveday
she
is
let
us
know
david
went
indoors
again
and
loveday
and
bob
continued
their
morning
survey
by
ascending
into
the
mysterious
quivering
recesses
of
the
mill
and
holding
a
discussion
over
a
second
pair
of
which
had
to
be
before
they
could
be
used
again
this
and
similar
things
occupied
nearly
twenty
minutes
and
looking
from
the
window
the
elder
of
the
two
was
reminded
of
the
time
of
day
by
seeing
garland
cloth
fluttering
from
her
back
door
over
the
heads
of
a
flock
of
pigeons
that
had
alighted
for
the
crumbs
suppose
david
ca
find
us
he
said
with
a
sense
of
hunger
that
was
not
altogether
strange
to
bob
he
put
out
his
head
and
shouted
lady
is
not
down
yet
said
his
man
in
reply
hurry
no
hurry
said
the
miller
with
cheerful
emptiness
to
pass
the
time
we
look
into
the
garden
get
up
sooner
than
this
you
know
when
she
signed
articles
and
got
a
berth
here
bob
observed
apologetically
yes
said
loveday
and
they
descended
into
the
garden
here
they
turned
over
sundry
flat
stones
and
killed
the
slugs
sheltered
beneath
them
from
the
coming
heat
of
the
day
talking
of
slugs
in
all
their
branches
of
the
brown
and
the
black
of
the
tough
and
the
tender
of
the
reason
why
there
were
so
many
in
the
garden
that
year
of
the
coming
time
when
the
harbouring
them
were
to
be
taken
up
and
gravel
laid
and
of
the
relatively
exterminatory
merits
of
a
pair
of
scissors
and
the
heel
of
the
shoe
at
last
the
miller
said
really
bob
i
hungry
we
must
begin
without
her
they
were
about
to
go
in
when
david
appeared
with
haste
in
his
motions
his
eyes
wider
vertically
than
crosswise
and
his
cheeks
nearly
all
gone
i
been
to
call
her
and
as
did
speak
i
rapped
and
as
did
answer
i
kicked
and
not
being
latched
the
door
opened
and
she
gone
bob
went
off
like
a
swallow
towards
the
house
and
the
miller
followed
like
the
rather
heavy
man
that
he
was
that
miss
matilda
was
not
in
her
room
or
a
scrap
of
anything
belonging
to
her
was
soon
apparent
they
searched
every
place
in
which
she
could
possibly
hide
or
squeeze
herself
every
place
in
which
she
could
not
but
found
nothing
at
all
captain
bob
was
quite
wild
with
astonishment
and
grief
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
nowhere
in
his
father
house
he
ran
into
garland
and
telling
them
the
story
so
hastily
that
they
hardly
understood
the
particulars
he
went
on
towards
comfort
house
intending
to
raise
the
alarm
there
and
also
at
mitchell
beach
cripplestraw
the
parson
the
clerk
the
camp
of
dragoons
of
hussars
and
so
on
through
the
whole
county
but
he
paused
and
thought
it
would
be
hardly
expedient
to
publish
his
discomfiture
in
such
a
way
if
matilda
had
left
the
house
for
any
freakish
reason
he
would
not
care
to
look
for
her
and
if
her
deed
had
a
tragic
intent
she
would
keep
aloof
from
camp
and
village
in
his
trouble
he
thought
of
anne
she
was
a
nice
girl
and
could
be
trusted
to
her
he
went
and
found
her
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
anxiety
which
equalled
his
own
so
lonely
to
cruise
for
her
all
by
myself
said
bob
disconsolately
his
forehead
all
in
wrinkles
i
thought
you
would
come
with
me
and
cheer
the
way
shall
we
search
said
anne
in
the
holes
of
rivers
you
know
and
down
wells
and
in
quarries
and
over
cliffs
and
like
that
your
eyes
might
catch
the
loom
of
any
bit
of
a
shawl
or
bonnet
that
i
should
overlook
and
it
would
do
me
a
real
service
please
do
come
so
anne
took
pity
upon
him
and
put
on
her
hat
and
went
the
miller
and
david
having
gone
off
in
another
direction
they
examined
the
ditches
of
fields
bob
going
round
by
one
fence
and
anne
by
the
other
till
they
met
at
the
opposite
side
then
they
peeped
under
culverts
into
outhouses
and
down
old
wells
and
quarries
till
the
theory
of
a
tragical
end
had
nearly
spent
its
force
in
bob
mind
and
he
began
to
think
that
matilda
had
simply
run
away
however
they
still
walked
on
though
by
this
time
the
sun
was
hot
and
anne
would
gladly
have
sat
down
did
you
think
highly
of
her
miss
garland
he
inquired
as
the
search
began
to
languish
yes
said
anne
highly
was
really
beautiful
no
nonsense
about
her
looks
was
there
her
beauty
was
thoroughly
ripe
not
too
young
we
should
all
have
got
to
love
her
what
can
have
possessed
her
to
go
away
do
know
and
upon
my
life
i
shall
soon
be
drove
to
say
i
care
replied
the
mate
despairingly
me
pilot
ye
down
over
those
stones
he
added
as
anne
began
to
descend
a
rugged
quarry
he
stepped
forward
leapt
down
and
turned
to
her
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
sprang
down
before
he
relinquished
his
hold
captain
bob
raised
her
fingers
to
his
lips
and
kissed
them
captain
loveday
cried
anne
snatching
away
her
hand
in
genuine
dismay
while
a
tear
rose
unexpectedly
to
each
eye
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
wo
go
an
inch
further
with
you
sir
it
is
too
barefaced
and
she
turned
and
ran
off
my
life
i
did
mean
it
said
the
repentant
captain
hastening
after
do
love
her
best
indeed
i
do
and
i
do
love
you
at
all
i
am
not
so
fickle
as
that
i
merely
just
for
the
moment
admired
you
as
a
sweet
little
craft
and
that
how
i
came
to
do
it
you
know
miss
garland
he
continued
earnestly
and
still
running
after
like
this
when
you
come
ashore
after
having
been
shut
up
in
a
ship
for
eighteen
months
seem
so
new
and
nice
that
you
ca
help
liking
them
one
and
all
in
a
body
and
so
your
heart
is
apt
to
get
scattered
and
to
yaw
a
bit
but
of
course
i
think
of
poor
matilda
most
and
shall
always
stick
to
her
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
tremendous
magnitude
to
show
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
his
heart
was
still
in
the
place
that
honour
required
am
glad
to
hear
that
of
course
i
am
very
glad
said
she
with
quick
petulance
keeping
her
face
turned
from
him
i
hope
we
shall
find
her
and
that
the
wedding
will
not
be
put
off
and
that
you
both
be
happy
but
i
wo
look
for
her
any
more
no
i
do
care
to
look
for
her
and
my
head
aches
i
am
going
home
so
am
i
said
robert
promptly
no
go
on
looking
for
her
of
course
all
the
afternoon
and
all
night
i
am
sure
you
will
if
you
love
her
yes
i
mean
to
still
i
ought
to
convoy
you
home
first
you
ought
not
and
i
shall
not
accept
your
company
sir
and
she
went
off
over
one
of
the
stone
stiles
with
which
the
spot
abounded
leaving
the
friendly
sailor
standing
in
the
field
he
sighed
again
and
observing
the
camp
not
far
off
thought
he
would
go
to
his
brother
john
and
ask
him
his
opinion
on
the
sorrowful
case
on
reaching
the
tents
he
found
that
john
was
not
at
liberty
just
at
that
time
being
engaged
in
practising
the
trumpeters
and
leaving
word
that
he
wished
the
to
come
down
to
the
mill
as
soon
as
possible
bob
went
back
again
no
good
looking
for
her
he
said
gloomily
liked
me
well
enough
but
when
she
came
here
and
saw
the
house
and
the
place
and
the
old
horse
and
the
plain
furniture
she
was
disappointed
to
find
us
all
so
homely
and
felt
she
did
care
to
marry
into
such
a
family
his
father
and
david
had
returned
with
no
news
is
as
i
been
thinking
father
bob
said
were
good
enough
for
her
and
she
went
away
in
scorn
that
ca
be
helped
said
the
miller
we
be
we
be
and
have
been
for
generations
to
my
mind
she
seemed
glad
enough
to
get
hold
of
us
yes
for
the
moment
because
of
the
flowers
and
birds
and
pretty
in
the
place
said
bob
tragically
you
do
know
father
how
should
you
know
who
have
hardly
been
out
of
overcombe
in
your
life
you
do
know
what
delicate
feelings
are
in
a
real
refined
woman
mind
any
little
vulgar
action
unreaves
their
nerves
like
a
now
i
wonder
if
you
did
anything
to
disgust
her
not
that
i
know
of
said
loveday
reflecting
did
say
a
single
thing
that
i
should
naturally
have
said
on
purpose
to
give
no
offence
was
always
very
homely
you
know
father
so
i
was
said
the
miller
meekly
wonder
what
it
could
have
been
bob
continued
wandering
about
restlessly
did
go
drinking
out
of
the
big
mug
with
your
mouth
full
or
wipe
your
lips
with
your
sleeve
i
swear
i
did
said
the
miller
firmly
i
no
knowing
what
i
may
do
to
shock
her
so
i
take
my
solid
victuals
in
the
bakehouse
and
only
a
crumb
and
a
drop
in
her
company
for
manners
could
do
no
more
than
that
certainly
said
bob
gently
my
manners
be
good
enough
for
people
like
the
garlands
they
be
good
enough
for
her
continued
the
miller
with
a
sense
of
injustice
true
then
it
must
have
been
david
david
come
here
how
did
you
behave
before
that
lady
now
mind
you
speak
the
truth
captain
robert
said
david
earnestly
assure
ye
she
was
served
like
a
royal
queen
the
best
silver
spoons
wez
put
down
and
yer
poor
grandfer
silver
tanket
as
you
seed
and
the
feather
cushion
for
her
to
sit
on
i
got
it
said
bob
decisively
bringing
down
his
hand
upon
the
bed
was
hard
and
there
nothing
shocks
a
true
lady
like
that
the
bed
in
that
room
always
was
as
hard
as
the
rock
of
gibraltar
captain
bob
the
beds
were
changed
was
they
maister
we
put
the
goose
bed
in
her
room
and
the
flock
one
that
used
to
be
there
in
yours
we
did
corroborated
the
miller
and
i
changed
with
our
own
hands
because
they
were
too
heavy
for
the
women
to
move
i
did
know
i
had
the
flock
bed
murmured
bob
slept
on
little
thinking
what
i
was
going
to
wake
to
well
well
she
gone
and
search
as
i
will
i
shall
never
find
another
like
her
she
was
too
good
for
me
she
must
have
carried
her
box
with
her
own
hands
poor
girl
as
far
as
that
goes
i
could
overtake
her
even
now
i
dare
say
but
i
entreat
her
against
her
will
not
i
miller
loveday
and
david
feeling
themselves
to
be
rather
a
desecration
in
the
presence
of
bob
sacred
emotions
managed
to
edge
off
by
degrees
the
former
burying
himself
in
the
most
floury
recesses
of
the
mill
his
invariable
resource
when
perturbed
the
rumbling
having
a
soothing
effect
upon
the
nerves
of
those
properly
trained
to
its
music
bob
was
so
impatient
that
after
going
up
to
her
room
to
assure
himself
once
more
that
she
had
not
undressed
but
had
only
lain
down
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
he
went
out
of
the
house
to
meet
john
and
waited
on
the
sunny
slope
of
the
down
till
his
brother
appeared
john
looked
so
brave
and
shapely
and
warlike
that
even
in
bob
present
distress
he
could
not
but
feel
an
honest
and
affectionate
pride
at
owning
such
a
relative
yet
he
fancied
that
john
did
not
come
along
with
the
same
swinging
step
he
had
shown
yesterday
and
when
the
got
nearer
he
looked
anxiously
at
the
mate
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
first
know
our
great
trouble
john
said
robert
gazing
stoically
into
his
brother
eyes
and
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
answered
the
showing
no
surprise
they
went
towards
a
slight
ravine
where
it
was
easier
to
sit
down
than
on
the
flat
ground
and
here
john
reclined
among
the
grasshoppers
pointing
to
his
brother
to
do
the
same
do
you
know
what
it
is
said
robert
anybody
told
ye
do
know
said
john
gone
and
i
am
thankful
said
bob
rising
to
his
knees
in
amazement
at
the
bottom
of
it
said
the
slowly
john
and
if
you
will
listen
i
tell
you
all
do
you
remember
what
happened
when
i
came
into
the
room
last
night
why
she
turned
colour
and
nearly
fainted
away
that
was
because
she
knew
me
bob
stared
at
his
brother
with
a
face
of
pain
and
distrust
once
bob
i
must
say
something
that
will
hurt
thee
a
good
deal
continued
john
was
not
a
woman
who
could
possibly
be
your
wife
and
so
she
gone
sent
her
off
i
did
tell
me
right
through
tell
me
i
had
better
said
the
his
blue
eyes
resting
on
the
far
distant
sea
that
seemed
to
rise
like
a
wall
as
high
as
the
hill
they
sat
upon
and
then
he
told
a
tale
of
miss
johnson
and
the
th
dragoons
which
wrung
his
heart
as
much
in
the
telling
as
it
did
bob
to
hear
and
which
showed
that
john
had
been
temporarily
cruel
to
be
ultimately
kind
even
bob
excited
as
he
was
could
discern
from
john
manner
of
speaking
what
a
terrible
undertaking
that
night
business
had
been
for
him
to
justify
the
course
he
had
adopted
the
dictates
of
duty
must
have
been
imperative
but
the
with
a
becoming
reticence
which
his
brother
at
the
time
was
naturally
unable
to
appreciate
scarcely
dwelt
distinctly
enough
upon
the
compelling
cause
of
his
conduct
it
would
indeed
have
been
hard
for
any
man
much
less
so
modest
a
one
as
john
to
do
himself
justice
in
that
remarkable
relation
when
the
listener
was
the
lady
lover
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
robert
rose
to
his
feet
and
put
a
greater
distance
between
himself
and
john
what
time
was
it
he
asked
in
a
hard
suppressed
voice
was
just
before
one
could
you
help
her
to
go
away
had
a
pass
i
carried
her
box
to
the
she
was
to
follow
at
dawn
she
had
no
money
she
had
i
took
particular
care
of
that
john
did
not
add
as
he
might
have
done
that
he
had
given
her
in
his
pity
all
the
money
he
possessed
and
at
present
had
only
in
the
world
it
is
over
bob
so
sit
ye
down
and
talk
with
me
of
old
times
he
added
jack
it
is
well
enough
for
you
to
speak
like
that
said
the
disquieted
sailor
i
ca
help
feeling
that
it
is
a
cruel
thing
you
have
done
after
all
she
would
have
been
snug
enough
for
me
would
i
had
never
found
out
this
about
her
john
why
did
you
interfere
you
had
no
right
to
overhaul
my
affairs
like
this
why
did
you
tell
me
fairly
all
you
knew
and
let
me
do
as
i
chose
you
have
turned
her
out
of
the
house
and
it
a
shame
if
she
had
only
come
to
me
why
she
she
knew
it
was
best
to
do
otherwise
i
shall
go
after
her
said
bob
firmly
can
do
as
you
like
said
john
i
would
advise
you
strongly
to
leave
matters
where
they
are
wo
leave
matters
where
they
are
said
bob
impetuously
have
made
me
miserable
and
all
for
nothing
i
tell
you
she
was
good
enough
for
me
and
as
long
as
i
knew
nothing
about
what
you
say
of
her
history
what
difference
would
it
have
made
to
me
never
was
there
a
young
woman
who
was
better
company
and
she
loved
a
merry
song
as
i
do
myself
yes
i
follow
her
bob
said
john
hardly
expected
this
because
you
did
know
your
man
can
i
ask
you
to
do
me
one
kindness
i
do
suppose
i
can
can
i
ask
you
not
to
say
a
word
against
her
to
any
of
them
at
home
the
very
reason
why
i
got
her
to
go
off
silently
as
she
has
done
was
because
nothing
should
be
said
against
her
here
and
no
scandal
should
be
heard
of
may
be
but
i
off
after
her
marry
that
girl
i
will
be
sorry
we
shall
see
replied
robert
with
determination
and
he
went
away
rapidly
towards
the
mill
the
had
no
heart
to
follow
no
good
could
possibly
come
of
further
opposition
and
there
on
the
down
he
remained
like
a
graven
image
till
bob
had
vanished
from
his
sight
into
the
mill
bob
entered
his
father
only
to
leave
word
that
he
was
going
on
a
renewed
search
for
matilda
and
to
pack
up
a
few
necessaries
for
his
journey
ten
minutes
later
he
came
out
again
with
a
bundle
in
his
hand
and
john
saw
him
go
diagonally
across
the
lower
fields
towards
the
road
this
is
all
the
good
i
have
done
said
john
musingly
readjusting
his
stock
where
it
cut
his
neck
and
descending
towards
the
mill
xx
how
they
lessened
the
effect
of
the
calamity
meanwhile
anne
garland
had
gone
home
and
being
weary
with
her
ramble
in
search
of
matilda
sat
silent
in
a
corner
of
the
room
her
mother
was
passing
the
time
in
giving
utterance
to
every
conceivable
surmise
on
the
cause
of
miss
johnson
disappearance
that
the
human
mind
could
frame
to
which
anne
returned
monosyllabic
answers
the
result
not
of
indifference
but
of
intense
preoccupation
presently
loveday
the
father
came
to
the
door
her
mother
vanished
with
him
and
they
remained
closeted
together
a
long
time
anne
went
into
the
garden
and
seated
herself
beneath
the
branching
tree
whose
boughs
had
sheltered
her
during
so
many
hours
of
her
residence
here
her
attention
was
fixed
more
upon
the
miller
wing
of
the
irregular
building
before
her
than
upon
that
occupied
by
her
mother
for
she
could
not
help
expecting
every
moment
to
see
some
one
run
out
with
a
wild
face
and
announce
some
awful
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
every
sound
set
her
on
the
alert
and
hearing
the
tread
of
a
horse
in
the
lane
she
looked
round
eagerly
gazing
at
her
over
the
hedge
was
festus
derriman
mounted
on
such
an
incredibly
tall
animal
that
he
could
see
to
her
very
feet
over
the
thick
and
broad
thorn
fence
she
no
sooner
recognized
him
than
she
withdrew
her
glance
but
as
his
eyes
were
fixed
steadily
upon
her
this
was
a
futile
manoeuvre
saw
you
look
round
he
exclaimed
crossly
have
i
done
to
make
you
behave
like
that
come
miss
garland
be
fair
is
no
use
to
turn
your
back
upon
me
as
she
did
not
turn
he
went
on
now
this
is
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
now
i
tell
you
what
miss
garland
here
stay
till
you
do
turn
round
if
is
all
the
afternoon
you
know
my
temper
what
i
say
i
mean
he
seated
himself
firmly
in
the
saddle
plucked
some
leaves
from
the
hedge
and
began
humming
a
song
to
show
how
absolutely
indifferent
he
was
to
the
flight
of
time
have
you
come
for
that
you
are
so
anxious
to
see
me
inquired
anne
when
at
last
he
had
wearied
her
patience
rising
and
facing
him
with
the
added
independence
which
came
from
a
sense
of
the
hedge
between
them
i
knew
you
would
turn
round
he
said
his
hot
angry
face
invaded
by
a
smile
in
which
his
teeth
showed
like
white
hemmed
in
by
red
at
chess
do
you
want
mr
derriman
said
she
what
do
you
want
mr
derriman
now
listen
to
that
is
that
my
encouragement
anne
bowed
superciliously
and
moved
away
have
just
heard
news
that
explains
all
that
said
the
giant
eyeing
her
movements
with
somnolent
irascibility
uncle
has
been
letting
things
out
he
was
here
late
last
night
and
he
saw
you
he
did
said
anne
now
he
saw
loveday
courting
somebody
like
you
in
that
garden
walk
and
when
he
came
you
ran
indoors
is
not
true
and
i
wish
to
hear
no
more
my
life
he
said
so
how
can
you
do
it
miss
garland
when
i
who
have
enough
money
to
buy
up
all
the
lovedays
would
gladly
come
to
terms
with
ye
what
a
simpleton
you
must
be
to
pass
me
over
for
him
there
now
you
are
angry
because
i
said
simpleton
i
did
mean
simpleton
i
meant
misguided
misguided
rosebud
that
it
run
off
he
continued
in
a
raised
voice
as
anne
made
towards
the
garden
door
i
have
you
yet
much
reason
you
have
to
be
too
proud
to
stay
with
me
but
it
last
long
i
shall
marry
you
madam
if
i
choose
as
you
see
when
he
was
quite
gone
and
anne
had
calmed
down
from
the
not
altogether
unrelished
fear
and
excitement
that
he
always
caused
her
she
returned
to
her
seat
under
the
tree
and
began
to
wonder
what
festus
derriman
story
meant
which
from
the
earnestness
of
his
tone
did
not
seem
like
a
pure
invention
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
her
mind
that
she
herself
had
heard
voices
in
the
garden
and
that
the
persons
seen
by
farmer
derriman
of
whose
visit
and
reclamation
of
his
box
the
miller
had
told
her
might
have
been
matilda
and
john
loveday
she
further
recalled
the
strange
agitation
of
miss
johnson
on
the
preceding
evening
and
that
it
occurred
just
at
the
entry
of
the
dragoon
till
by
degrees
suspicion
amounted
to
conviction
that
he
knew
more
than
any
one
else
supposed
of
that
disappearance
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
the
descended
to
the
mill
after
his
talk
with
his
brother
on
the
down
as
fate
would
have
it
instead
of
entering
the
house
he
turned
aside
to
the
garden
and
walked
down
that
pleasant
enclosure
to
learn
if
he
were
likely
to
find
in
the
other
half
of
it
the
woman
he
loved
so
well
yes
there
she
was
sitting
on
the
seat
of
logs
that
he
had
repaired
for
her
under
the
but
she
was
not
facing
in
his
direction
he
walked
with
a
noisier
tread
he
coughed
he
shook
a
bough
he
did
everything
in
short
but
the
one
thing
that
festus
did
in
the
same
circumstances
call
out
to
her
he
would
not
have
ventured
on
that
for
the
world
any
of
his
signs
would
have
been
sufficient
to
attract
her
a
day
or
two
earlier
now
she
would
not
turn
at
last
in
his
fond
anxiety
he
did
what
he
had
never
done
before
without
an
invitation
and
crossed
over
into
garland
half
of
the
garden
till
he
stood
before
her
when
she
could
not
escape
him
she
arose
and
saying
afternoon
in
a
glacial
manner
unusual
with
her
walked
away
to
another
part
of
the
garden
loveday
quite
at
a
loss
had
not
the
strength
of
mind
to
persevere
further
he
had
a
vague
apprehension
that
some
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
previous
night
unhappy
business
had
reached
her
and
unable
to
remedy
the
evil
without
telling
more
than
he
dared
he
went
into
the
mill
where
his
father
still
was
looking
doleful
enough
what
with
his
concern
at
events
and
the
extra
quantity
of
flour
upon
his
face
through
sticking
so
closely
to
business
that
day
john
bob
has
told
you
all
of
course
a
queer
strange
perplexing
thing
is
it
i
ca
make
it
out
at
all
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
the
woman
or
it
could
have
happened
i
been
so
upset
for
years
have
i
would
it
should
have
happened
for
all
i
own
in
the
world
said
the
dragoon
you
spoke
to
anne
garland
or
has
anybody
been
talking
to
her
derriman
rode
by
ago
and
talked
to
her
over
the
hedge
john
guessed
the
rest
and
after
standing
on
the
threshold
in
silence
awhile
walked
away
towards
the
camp
all
this
time
his
brother
robert
had
been
hastening
along
in
pursuit
of
the
woman
who
had
withdrawn
from
the
scene
to
avoid
the
exposure
and
complete
overthrow
which
would
have
resulted
had
she
remained
as
the
distance
lengthened
between
himself
and
the
mill
bob
was
conscious
of
some
cooling
down
of
the
excitement
that
had
prompted
him
to
set
out
but
he
did
not
pause
in
his
walk
till
he
had
reached
the
head
of
the
river
which
fed
the
here
for
some
indefinite
reason
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
be
attracted
by
the
bubbling
spring
whose
waters
never
failed
or
lessened
and
he
stopped
as
if
to
look
longer
at
the
scene
it
was
really
because
his
mind
was
so
absorbed
by
john
story
the
sun
was
warm
the
spot
was
a
pleasant
one
and
he
deposited
his
bundle
and
sat
down
by
degrees
as
he
reflected
first
on
john
view
and
then
on
his
own
his
convictions
became
unsettled
till
at
length
he
was
so
balanced
between
the
impulse
to
go
on
and
the
impulse
to
go
back
that
a
puff
of
wind
either
way
would
have
been
sufficient
to
decide
for
him
when
he
allowed
john
story
to
repeat
itself
in
his
ears
the
reasonableness
and
good
sense
of
his
advice
seemed
beyond
question
when
on
the
other
hand
he
thought
of
his
poor
eyes
and
her
to
him
pleasant
ways
their
charming
arrangements
to
marry
and
her
probable
willingness
still
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
do
otherwise
than
follow
on
the
road
at
the
top
of
his
speed
this
strife
of
thought
was
so
well
maintained
that
sitting
and
standing
he
remained
on
the
borders
of
the
spring
till
the
shadows
had
stretched
out
eastwards
and
the
chance
of
overtaking
matilda
had
grown
considerably
less
still
he
did
not
positively
go
towards
home
at
last
he
took
a
guinea
from
his
pocket
and
resolved
to
put
the
question
to
the
hazard
i
go
tails
i
do
the
piece
of
gold
spun
in
the
air
and
came
down
heads
i
wo
go
after
all
he
said
wo
be
steered
by
accidents
any
more
he
picked
up
his
bundle
and
switch
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
overcombe
mill
knocking
down
the
brambles
and
nettles
as
he
went
with
gloomy
and
indifferent
blows
when
he
got
within
sight
of
the
house
he
beheld
david
in
the
road
right
all
right
again
captain
shouted
that
retainer
wedding
after
all
hurrah
she
back
again
cried
bob
seizing
david
ecstatically
and
dancing
round
with
him
but
it
all
the
same
it
is
of
no
consequence
at
all
and
no
harm
will
be
done
maister
and
garland
have
made
up
a
match
and
mean
to
marry
at
once
that
the
wedding
victuals
may
not
be
wasted
they
felt
be
a
thousand
pities
to
let
such
good
things
get
for
want
of
a
ceremony
to
use
upon
and
at
last
they
have
thought
of
this
i
do
care
for
the
victuals
bitterly
cried
bob
in
a
tone
of
far
higher
thought
you
disappoint
me
and
he
went
slowly
towards
the
house
his
father
appeared
in
the
opening
of
the
looking
more
cheerful
than
when
they
had
parted
robert
you
been
after
her
he
said
then
i
would
have
followed
her
if
i
had
been
as
sure
as
you
were
that
she
went
away
in
scorn
of
us
since
you
told
me
that
i
have
not
looked
for
her
at
all
was
wrong
father
bob
replied
gravely
throwing
down
his
bundle
and
stick
i
find
has
not
gone
away
in
scorn
of
us
she
has
gone
away
for
other
reasons
i
followed
her
some
way
but
i
have
come
back
again
she
may
go
is
she
gone
said
the
astonished
miller
bob
had
intended
for
matilda
sake
to
give
no
reason
to
a
living
soul
for
her
departure
but
he
could
not
treat
his
father
thus
reservedly
and
he
told
has
made
great
fools
of
us
said
the
miller
deliberately
she
might
have
made
us
greater
ones
bob
i
thought
th
hadst
more
sense
do
say
anything
against
her
father
implored
bob
a
sorry
haul
and
there
an
end
o
let
her
down
quietly
and
keep
the
secret
you
promise
that
do
loveday
the
elder
remained
thinking
awhile
and
then
went
on
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
this
i
hit
upon
a
plan
to
get
out
of
the
awkward
corner
she
has
put
us
in
what
you
think
of
it
i
ca
say
has
just
given
me
the
heads
do
it
hurt
your
feelings
my
son
at
such
a
time
i
bring
myself
to
bear
it
anyhow
why
should
i
object
to
other
people
happiness
because
i
have
lost
my
own
said
bob
with
saintly
in
his
air
said
answered
the
miller
heartily
you
may
be
sure
that
there
will
be
no
unseemly
rejoicing
to
disturb
ye
in
your
present
frame
of
mind
all
the
morning
i
felt
more
ashamed
than
i
cared
to
own
at
the
thought
of
how
the
neighbours
great
and
small
would
laugh
at
what
they
would
call
your
folly
when
they
knew
what
had
happened
so
i
resolved
to
take
this
step
to
stave
it
off
if
so
be
was
possible
and
when
i
saw
garland
i
knew
i
had
done
right
she
pitied
me
so
much
for
having
had
the
house
cleaned
in
vain
and
laid
in
provisions
to
waste
that
it
put
her
into
the
humour
to
agree
we
mean
to
do
it
right
off
at
once
afore
the
pies
and
cakes
get
mouldy
and
the
blackpot
stale
was
a
good
thought
of
mine
and
hers
and
i
am
glad
is
settled
he
concluded
cheerfully
matilda
murmured
bob
i
was
afraid
hurt
thy
feelings
said
the
miller
with
preparations
for
thy
wedding
and
using
them
for
my
own
said
bob
heroically
shall
not
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
in
my
sorrow
to
feel
that
the
splendid
grub
and
the
ale
and
your
stunning
new
suit
of
clothes
and
the
great
you
bought
will
be
just
as
useful
now
as
if
i
had
married
myself
poor
matilda
but
you
wo
expect
me
to
join
in
you
hardly
can
i
can
sheer
off
that
day
very
easily
you
know
bob
said
the
miller
reproachfully
could
stand
it
i
should
break
down
take
me
if
i
would
have
asked
her
then
if
i
had
known
was
going
to
drive
thee
out
of
the
house
now
come
bob
i
find
a
way
of
arranging
it
and
sobering
it
down
so
that
it
shall
be
as
melancholy
as
you
can
require
in
short
just
like
a
funeral
if
promise
to
stay
well
said
the
afflicted
one
that
condition
i
stay
xxi
the
hill
he
having
entered
into
this
solemn
compact
with
his
son
the
elder
next
action
was
to
go
to
garland
and
ask
her
how
the
toning
down
of
the
wedding
had
best
be
done
is
plain
enough
that
to
make
merry
just
now
would
be
slighting
bob
feelings
as
if
we
did
care
who
was
not
married
so
long
as
we
were
he
said
then
what
to
be
done
about
the
victuals
a
dinner
to
the
poor
folk
she
suggested
can
get
everything
used
up
that
way
true
said
the
miller
enough
of
in
these
times
to
carry
off
any
extras
whatsoever
it
will
save
bob
feelings
wonderfully
and
they
wo
know
that
the
dinner
was
got
for
another
sort
of
wedding
and
another
sort
of
guests
so
you
have
their
for
nothing
the
miller
smiled
at
the
subtlety
of
the
view
can
hardly
be
called
fair
he
said
i
did
mean
some
of
it
for
them
for
the
friends
we
meant
to
ask
would
not
have
cleared
all
upon
the
whole
the
idea
pleased
him
well
particularly
when
he
noticed
the
forlorn
look
of
his
sailor
son
as
he
walked
about
the
place
and
pictured
the
inevitably
jarring
effect
of
fiddles
and
tambourines
upon
bob
shattered
nerves
at
such
a
crisis
even
if
the
notes
of
the
former
were
dulled
by
the
application
of
a
mute
and
bob
shut
up
in
a
distant
bedroom
a
plan
which
had
at
first
occurred
to
him
he
therefore
told
bob
that
the
surcharged
larder
was
to
be
emptied
by
the
charitable
process
above
alluded
to
and
hoped
he
would
not
mind
making
himself
useful
in
such
a
good
and
gloomy
work
bob
readily
fell
in
with
the
scheme
and
it
was
at
once
put
in
hand
and
the
tables
spread
the
alacrity
with
which
the
substituted
wedding
was
carried
out
seemed
to
show
that
the
worthy
pair
of
neighbours
would
have
joined
themselves
into
one
long
ago
had
there
previously
occurred
any
domestic
incident
dictating
such
a
step
as
an
apposite
expedient
apart
from
their
personal
wish
to
marry
the
appointed
morning
came
and
the
service
quietly
took
place
at
the
cheerful
hour
of
ten
in
the
face
of
a
triangular
congregation
of
which
the
base
was
the
front
pew
and
the
apex
the
west
door
garland
dressed
herself
in
the
muslin
shawl
like
queen
charlotte
that
bob
had
brought
home
and
her
best
gown
beneath
which
peeped
out
her
shoes
with
red
rosettes
anne
was
present
but
she
considerately
toned
herself
down
so
as
not
to
too
seriously
damage
her
appearance
at
moments
during
the
ceremony
she
had
a
distressing
sense
that
she
ought
not
to
be
born
and
was
glad
to
get
home
again
the
interest
excited
in
the
village
though
real
was
hardly
enough
to
bring
a
serious
blush
to
the
face
of
coyness
neighbours
minds
had
become
so
saturated
by
the
abundance
of
showy
military
and
regal
incident
lately
vouchsafed
to
them
that
the
wedding
of
civilians
was
of
small
account
excepting
in
so
far
that
it
solved
the
question
whether
or
not
garland
would
consider
herself
too
genteel
to
mate
with
a
grinder
of
corn
in
the
evening
loveday
heart
was
made
glad
by
seeing
the
baked
and
boiled
in
rapid
process
of
consumption
by
the
kitchenful
of
people
assembled
for
that
purpose
of
an
hour
were
sufficient
to
banish
for
ever
his
fears
as
to
spoilt
food
the
provisions
being
the
cause
of
the
assembly
and
not
its
consequence
it
had
been
determined
to
get
all
that
would
not
keep
consumed
on
that
day
even
if
highways
and
hedges
had
to
be
searched
for
operators
and
in
addition
to
the
poor
and
needy
every
cottager
daughter
known
to
the
miller
was
invited
and
told
to
bring
her
lover
from
camp
an
expedient
which
for
letting
daylight
into
the
inside
of
full
platters
was
among
the
most
happy
ever
known
while
and
loveday
anne
and
bob
were
standing
in
the
parlour
discussing
the
progress
of
the
entertainment
in
the
next
room
john
who
had
not
been
down
all
day
entered
the
house
and
looked
in
upon
them
through
the
open
door
this
john
why
did
you
come
before
to
see
the
captain
and
other
duties
said
the
in
a
tone
which
showed
no
great
zeal
for
explanations
come
in
however
continued
the
miller
as
his
son
remained
with
his
hand
on
the
surveying
them
reflectively
can
not
stay
long
said
john
advancing
route
is
come
and
we
are
going
away
away
where
to
exonbury
morning
of
you
some
and
some
next
day
the
king
goes
next
week
am
sorry
for
this
said
the
miller
not
expressing
half
his
sorrow
by
the
simple
utterance
wish
you
could
have
been
here
since
this
is
the
case
he
added
looking
at
the
horizon
through
the
window
loveday
also
expressed
her
regret
which
seemed
to
remind
the
of
the
event
of
the
day
and
he
went
to
her
and
tried
to
say
something
befitting
the
occasion
anne
had
not
said
that
she
was
either
sorry
or
glad
but
john
loveday
fancied
that
she
had
looked
rather
relieved
than
otherwise
when
she
heard
his
news
his
conversation
with
bob
on
the
down
made
bob
manner
too
remarkably
cool
notwithstanding
that
he
had
after
all
followed
his
brother
advice
which
it
was
as
yet
too
soon
after
the
event
for
him
to
rightly
value
john
did
not
know
why
the
sailor
had
come
back
never
supposing
that
it
was
because
he
had
thought
better
of
going
and
said
to
him
privately
did
overtake
her
did
try
to
said
bob
you
are
not
going
to
i
shall
let
her
drift
am
glad
indeed
bob
you
have
been
wise
said
john
heartily
bob
however
still
loved
matilda
too
well
to
be
other
than
dissatisfied
with
john
and
the
event
that
he
had
precipitated
which
the
elder
brother
only
too
promptly
perceived
and
it
made
his
stay
that
evening
of
short
duration
before
leaving
he
said
with
some
hesitation
to
his
father
including
anne
and
her
mother
by
his
glance
you
think
to
come
up
and
see
us
off
the
miller
answered
for
them
all
and
said
that
of
course
they
would
come
you
step
down
again
between
now
and
then
he
inquired
try
to
he
added
after
a
pause
case
i
should
not
remember
that
revalley
will
sound
at
half
past
five
we
shall
leave
about
eight
next
summer
perhaps
we
shall
come
and
camp
here
again
hope
so
said
his
father
and
loveday
there
was
something
in
john
manner
which
indicated
to
anne
that
he
scarcely
intended
to
come
down
again
but
the
others
did
not
notice
it
and
she
said
nothing
he
departed
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
dusk
of
the
august
evening
leaving
anne
still
in
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
private
meeting
with
miss
johnson
john
loveday
had
been
going
to
tell
them
that
on
the
last
night
by
an
especial
privilege
it
would
be
in
his
power
to
come
and
stay
with
them
until
eleven
but
at
the
moment
of
leaving
he
abandoned
the
intention
anne
attitude
had
chilled
him
and
made
him
anxious
to
be
off
he
utilized
the
spare
hours
of
that
last
night
in
another
way
this
was
by
coming
down
from
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
in
the
evening
and
seating
himself
near
the
brink
of
the
as
soon
as
it
was
quite
dark
where
he
watched
the
lights
in
the
different
windows
till
one
appeared
in
anne
bedroom
and
she
herself
came
forward
to
shut
the
casement
with
the
candle
in
her
hand
the
light
shone
out
upon
the
broad
and
deep
illuminating
to
a
distinct
individuality
every
moth
and
gnat
that
entered
the
quivering
chain
of
radiance
stretching
across
the
water
towards
him
and
every
bubble
or
atom
of
froth
that
floated
into
its
width
she
stood
for
some
time
looking
out
little
thinking
what
the
darkness
concealed
on
the
other
side
of
that
wide
stream
till
at
length
she
closed
the
casement
drew
the
curtains
and
retreated
into
the
room
presently
the
light
went
out
upon
which
john
loveday
returned
to
camp
and
lay
down
in
his
tent
the
next
morning
was
dull
and
windy
and
the
trumpets
of
the
th
sounded
reveille
for
the
last
time
on
overcombe
down
knowing
that
the
dragoons
were
going
away
anne
had
slept
heedfully
and
was
at
once
awakened
by
the
smart
notes
she
looked
out
of
the
window
to
find
that
the
miller
was
already
astir
his
white
form
being
visible
at
the
end
of
his
garden
where
he
stood
motionless
watching
the
preparations
anne
also
looked
on
as
well
as
she
could
through
the
dim
grey
gloom
and
soon
she
saw
the
blue
smoke
from
the
cooks
fires
creeping
fitfully
along
the
ground
instead
of
rising
in
vertical
columns
as
it
had
done
during
the
fine
weather
season
then
the
men
began
to
carry
their
bedding
to
the
waggons
and
others
to
throw
all
refuse
into
the
trenches
till
the
down
was
lively
as
an
anne
did
not
want
to
see
john
loveday
again
but
hearing
the
household
astir
she
began
to
dress
at
leisure
looking
out
at
the
camp
the
while
when
the
soldiers
had
breakfasted
she
saw
them
selling
and
giving
away
their
superfluous
crockery
to
the
natives
who
had
clustered
round
and
then
they
pulled
down
and
cleared
away
the
temporary
kitchens
which
they
had
constructed
when
they
came
a
tapping
of
and
wriggling
of
followed
and
soon
the
cones
of
white
canvas
now
almost
become
a
component
part
of
the
landscape
fell
to
the
ground
at
this
moment
the
miller
came
indoors
and
asked
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
if
anybody
was
going
up
the
hill
with
him
anne
felt
that
in
spite
of
the
cloud
hanging
over
john
in
her
mind
it
would
ill
become
the
present
moment
not
to
see
him
off
and
she
went
downstairs
to
her
mother
who
was
already
there
though
bob
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
each
took
an
arm
of
the
miller
and
thus
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
hill
by
this
time
the
men
and
horses
were
at
the
place
of
assembly
and
shortly
after
the
reached
level
ground
the
troops
slowly
began
to
move
forward
when
the
half
buried
in
his
uniform
arms
and
drew
near
to
the
spot
where
the
lovedays
were
waiting
to
see
him
pass
his
father
turned
anxiously
to
anne
and
said
will
shake
hands
with
john
anne
faintly
replied
and
allowed
the
miller
to
take
her
forward
on
his
arm
to
the
trackway
so
as
to
be
close
to
the
flank
of
the
approaching
column
it
came
up
many
people
on
each
side
grasping
the
hands
of
the
troopers
in
bidding
them
farewell
and
as
soon
as
john
loveday
saw
the
members
of
his
father
household
he
stretched
down
his
hand
across
his
right
pistol
for
the
same
performance
the
miller
gave
his
then
loveday
gave
hers
and
then
the
hand
of
the
was
extended
towards
anne
but
as
the
horse
did
not
absolutely
stop
it
was
a
somewhat
awkward
performance
for
a
young
woman
to
undertake
and
more
on
that
account
than
on
any
other
anne
drew
back
and
the
gallant
trooper
passed
by
without
receiving
her
adieu
anne
heart
reproached
her
for
a
moment
and
then
she
thought
that
after
all
he
was
not
going
off
to
immediate
battle
and
that
she
would
in
all
probability
see
him
again
at
no
distant
date
when
she
hoped
that
the
mystery
of
his
conduct
would
be
explained
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
voice
at
her
elbow
heaven
he
gone
now
there
a
chance
for
me
she
turned
and
festus
derriman
was
standing
by
her
no
chance
for
you
she
said
indignantly
not
there
another
left
the
words
had
slipped
out
quite
unintentionally
and
she
blushed
quickly
she
would
have
given
anything
to
be
able
to
recall
them
but
he
had
heard
and
said
anne
went
forward
to
the
miller
to
avoid
replying
and
festus
caught
her
no
more
anybody
been
hanging
about
overcombe
mill
except
loveday
son
the
soldier
he
asked
of
a
comrade
son
the
sailor
was
the
reply
his
son
the
sailor
said
festus
slowly
his
son
the
sailor
xxii
the
two
households
united
at
this
particular
moment
the
object
of
festus
derriman
fulmination
was
assuredly
not
dangerous
as
a
rival
bob
after
abstractedly
watching
the
soldiers
from
the
front
of
the
house
till
they
were
out
of
sight
had
gone
within
doors
and
seated
himself
in
the
where
his
father
found
him
his
elbows
resting
on
the
table
and
his
forehead
on
his
hands
his
eyes
being
fixed
upon
a
document
that
lay
open
before
him
art
perusing
bob
with
such
a
long
face
bob
sighed
and
then
loveday
and
anne
entered
only
a
paper
that
i
fondly
thought
i
should
have
a
use
for
he
said
gloomily
and
looking
down
as
before
he
cleared
his
voice
as
if
moved
inwardly
to
go
on
and
began
to
read
in
feeling
tones
from
what
proved
to
be
his
nullified
marriage
licence
timothy
titus
philemon
by
permission
bishop
of
bristol
to
our
beloved
robert
loveday

parish
of

bachelor
and
matilda
johnson
of
the
same
parish
spinster
greeting
here
anne
sighed
but
contrived
to
keep
down
her
sigh
to
a
mere
nothing
language
is
it
said
bob
was
never
greeted
like
that
afore
i
have
often
thought
it
very
excellent
language
myself
said
loveday
to
that
the
old
gentleman
will
greet
thee
like
it
again
any
day
for
a
couple
of
guineas
said
the
miller
not
the
point
father
you
never
could
see
the
real
meaning
of
these
things
well
then
he
goes
on
whereas
ye
are
as
it
is
alleged
determined
to
enter
into
the
holy
estate
of
matrimony
but
why
should
i
read
on
it
all
means
nothing
now
nothing
and
the
splendid
words
are
all
wasted
upon
air
it
seems
as
if
i
had
been
hailed
by
some
venerable
hoary
prophet
and
had
turned
away
put
the
helm
hard
up
and
would
hear
nobody
replied
feeling
probably
that
sympathy
could
not
meet
the
case
and
bob
went
on
reading
the
rest
of
it
to
himself
occasionally
heaving
a
breath
like
the
wind
in
a
ship
shrouds
would
set
my
mind
so
much
upon
her
if
i
was
thee
said
his
father
at
last
not
folk
might
call
thee
a
fool
and
say
thy
brains
were
turning
to
water
bob
was
apparently
much
struck
by
this
thought
and
instead
of
continuing
the
discourse
further
he
carefully
folded
up
the
licence
went
out
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
it
was
startlingly
apt
what
his
father
had
said
and
worse
than
that
what
people
would
call
him
might
be
true
and
the
liquefaction
of
his
brains
turn
out
to
be
no
fable
by
degrees
he
became
much
concerned
and
the
more
he
examined
himself
by
this
new
light
the
more
clearly
did
he
perceive
that
he
was
in
a
very
bad
way
on
reflection
he
remembered
that
since
miss
johnson
departure
his
appetite
had
decreased
amazingly
he
had
eaten
in
meat
no
more
than
fourteen
or
fifteen
ounces
a
day
but
of
a
quartern
pudding
on
an
average
in
vegetables
only
a
small
heap
of
potatoes
and
half
a
york
cabbage
and
no
gravy
whatever
which
considering
the
usual
appetite
of
a
seaman
for
fresh
food
at
the
end
of
a
long
voyage
was
no
small
index
of
the
depression
of
his
mind
then
he
had
waked
once
every
night
and
on
one
occasion
twice
while
dressing
each
morning
since
the
gloomy
day
he
had
not
whistled
more
than
seven
bars
of
a
hornpipe
without
stopping
and
falling
into
thought
of
a
most
painful
kind
and
he
had
told
none
but
absolutely
true
stories
of
foreign
parts
to
the
neighbouring
villagers
when
they
saluted
and
clustered
about
him
as
usual
for
anything
he
chose
to
pour
forth
except
that
story
of
the
whale
whose
eye
was
about
as
large
as
the
round
pond
in
derriman
which
was
like
tempting
fate
to
set
a
seal
for
ever
upon
his
tongue
as
a
traveller
all
this
enervation
mental
and
physical
had
been
produced
by
departure
he
also
considered
what
he
had
lost
of
the
rational
amusements
of
manhood
during
these
unfortunate
days
he
might
have
gone
to
the
neighbouring
fashionable
resort
every
afternoon
stood
before
gloucester
lodge
till
the
king
and
queen
came
out
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
enjoyed
their
majesties
smiles
at
his
homage
all
for
nothing
watched
the
heard
the
different
bands
strike
up
observed
the
staff
and
above
all
have
seen
the
pretty
town
girls
go
along
the
esplanade
deliberately
fixing
their
innocent
eyes
on
the
distant
sea
the
grey
cliffs
and
the
sky
and
accidentally
on
the
soldiers
and
himself
raze
out
her
image
he
said
shall
make
a
fool
of
me
no
more
and
his
resolve
resulted
in
conduct
which
had
elements
of
real
greatness
he
went
back
to
his
father
whom
he
found
in
the
true
father
what
you
say
he
observed
brains
will
turn
to
if
i
think
of
her
much
longer
by
the
oath
of
a
navigator
i
wish
i
could
sigh
less
and
laugh
more
she
gone
why
ca
i
let
her
go
and
be
happy
but
how
begin
it
careless
my
son
said
the
miller
lay
yourself
out
to
enjoy
snacks
and
cordials
that
a
thought
said
bob
is
good
so
is
sperrits
though
i
do
advise
thee
to
drink
neat
i
almost
forgot
it
said
captain
loveday
he
went
to
his
room
hastily
untied
the
package
of
tobacco
that
he
had
brought
home
and
began
to
make
use
of
it
in
his
own
way
calling
to
david
for
a
bottle
of
the
old
household
mead
that
had
lain
in
the
cellar
these
eleven
years
he
was
discovered
by
his
father
of
an
hour
later
as
a
object
behind
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
miller
drew
a
breath
of
relief
bob
he
said
thought
the
house
was
smoking
rather
fast
to
drown
my
reflections
father
is
no
use
to
chaw
to
tempt
his
attenuated
appetite
the
unhappy
mate
made
david
cook
an
omelet
and
bake
a
the
latter
so
richly
compounded
that
it
opened
to
the
knife
like
a
freckled
buttercup
with
the
same
object
he
stuck
into
the
banks
of
the
and
drew
up
next
morning
a
family
of
fat
eels
some
of
which
were
skinned
and
prepared
for
his
breakfast
they
were
his
favourite
fish
but
such
had
been
his
condition
that
until
the
moment
of
making
this
effort
he
had
quite
forgotten
their
existence
at
his
father
in
a
few
days
bob
loveday
had
considerably
improved
in
tone
and
vigour
one
other
obvious
remedy
for
his
dejection
was
to
indulge
in
the
society
of
miss
garland
love
being
so
much
more
effectually
got
rid
of
by
displacement
than
by
attempted
annihilation
but
loveday
belief
that
he
had
offended
her
beyond
forgiveness
and
his
sense
of
her
as
a
woman
who
by
education
and
antecedents
was
fitted
to
adorn
a
higher
sphere
than
his
own
effectually
kept
him
from
going
near
her
for
a
long
time
notwithstanding
that
they
were
inmates
of
one
house
the
reserve
was
however
in
some
degree
broken
by
the
appearance
one
morning
later
in
the
season
of
the
point
of
a
saw
through
the
partition
which
divided
anne
room
from
the
loveday
half
of
the
house
though
she
dined
and
supped
with
her
mother
and
the
loveday
family
miss
garland
had
still
continued
to
occupy
her
old
apartments
because
she
found
it
more
convenient
there
to
pursue
her
hobbies
of
and
of
copying
her
father
old
pictures
the
division
wall
had
not
as
yet
been
broken
down
as
the
saw
worked
its
way
downwards
under
her
astonished
gaze
anne
jumped
up
from
her
drawing
and
presently
the
temporary
canvasing
and
papering
which
had
sealed
up
the
old
door
of
communication
was
cut
completely
through
the
door
burst
open
and
bob
stood
revealed
on
the
other
side
with
the
saw
in
his
hand
beg
your
ladyship
pardon
he
said
taking
off
the
hat
he
had
been
working
in
as
his
handsome
face
expanded
into
a
smile
did
know
this
door
opened
into
your
private
room
captain
loveday
am
pulling
down
the
division
on
principle
as
we
are
now
one
family
but
i
really
thought
the
door
opened
into
your
passage
do
matter
i
can
get
another
room
at
all
father
would
let
me
turn
you
out
i
close
it
up
again
but
anne
was
so
interested
in
the
novelty
of
a
new
doorway
that
she
walked
through
it
and
found
herself
in
a
dark
low
passage
which
she
had
never
seen
before
leads
to
the
mill
said
bob
you
like
to
go
in
and
see
it
at
work
but
perhaps
you
have
already
into
the
ground
floor
all
over
it
i
am
practising
as
grinder
you
know
to
help
my
father
she
followed
him
along
the
dark
passage
in
the
side
of
which
he
opened
a
little
trap
when
she
saw
a
great
slimy
cavern
where
the
long
arms
of
the
flung
themselves
slowly
and
distractedly
round
and
splashing
caught
the
little
light
that
strayed
into
the
gloomy
place
turning
it
into
stars
and
flashes
a
cold
puff
of
air
came
into
their
faces
and
the
roar
from
within
made
it
necessary
for
anne
to
shout
as
she
said
is
dismal
let
us
go
on
bob
shut
the
trap
the
roar
ceased
and
they
went
on
to
the
inner
part
of
the
mill
where
the
air
was
warm
and
nutty
and
pervaded
by
a
fog
of
flour
then
they
ascended
the
stairs
and
saw
the
stones
lumbering
round
and
round
and
the
yellow
corn
running
down
through
the
hopper
they
climbed
yet
further
to
the
top
stage
where
the
wheat
lay
in
bins
and
where
long
rays
like
feelers
stretched
in
from
the
sun
through
the
little
window
got
nearly
lost
among
cobwebs
and
timber
and
completed
their
course
by
marking
the
opposite
wall
with
a
glowing
patch
of
gold
in
his
earnestness
as
an
exhibitor
bob
opened
the
bolter
which
was
spinning
rapidly
round
the
result
being
that
a
dense
cloud
of
flour
rolled
out
in
their
faces
reminding
anne
that
her
complexion
was
probably
much
paler
by
this
time
than
when
she
had
entered
the
mill
she
thanked
her
companion
for
his
trouble
and
said
she
would
now
go
down
he
followed
her
with
the
same
deference
as
hitherto
and
with
a
sudden
and
increasing
sense
that
of
all
cures
for
his
former
unhappy
passion
this
would
have
been
the
nicest
the
easiest
and
the
most
effectual
if
he
had
only
been
fortunate
enough
to
keep
her
upon
easy
terms
but
miss
garland
showed
no
disposition
to
go
further
than
accept
his
services
as
a
guide
she
descended
to
the
open
air
shook
the
flour
from
her
like
a
bird
and
went
on
into
the
garden
amid
the
september
sunshine
whose
rays
lay
level
across
the
blue
haze
which
the
earth
gave
forth
the
gnats
were
dancing
up
and
down
in
airy
companies
the
nasturtium
flowers
shone
out
in
groups
from
the
dark
hedge
over
which
they
climbed
and
the
mellow
smell
of
the
decline
of
summer
was
exhaled
by
everything
bob
followed
her
as
far
as
the
gate
looked
after
her
thought
of
her
as
the
same
girl
who
had
half
encouraged
him
years
ago
when
she
seemed
so
superior
to
him
though
now
they
were
almost
equal
she
apparently
thought
him
beneath
her
it
was
with
a
new
sense
of
pleasure
that
his
mind
flew
to
the
fact
that
she
was
now
an
inmate
of
his
father
house
his
obsequious
bearing
was
continued
during
the
next
week
in
the
busy
hours
of
the
day
they
seldom
met
but
they
regularly
encountered
each
other
at
meals
and
these
cheerful
occasions
began
to
have
an
interest
for
him
quite
irrespective
of
dishes
and
cups
when
anne
entered
and
took
her
seat
she
was
always
loudly
hailed
by
miller
loveday
as
he
whetted
his
knife
but
from
bob
she
condescended
to
accept
no
such
familiar
greeting
and
they
often
sat
down
together
as
if
each
had
a
blind
eye
in
the
direction
of
the
other
bob
sometimes
told
serious
and
correct
stories
about
pilots
boatswains
mates
able
seamen
and
other
curious
fauna
of
the
marine
world
but
these
were
directly
addressed
to
his
father
and
loveday
anne
being
included
at
the
by
a
glance
only
he
sometimes
opened
bottles
of
sweet
cider
for
her
and
then
she
thanked
him
but
even
this
did
not
lead
to
her
encouraging
his
chat
one
day
when
anne
was
paring
an
apple
she
was
left
at
table
with
the
young
man
have
made
something
for
you
he
said
she
looked
all
over
the
table
nothing
was
there
save
the
ordinary
remnants
i
do
mean
that
it
is
here
it
is
out
by
the
bridge
at
the
he
arose
and
anne
followed
with
curiosity
in
her
eyes
and
with
her
firm
little
mouth
pouted
up
to
a
puzzled
shape
on
reaching
the
mossy
head
she
found
that
he
had
fixed
in
the
keen
damp
draught
which
always
prevailed
over
the
wheel
an
aeolian
harp
of
large
size
at
present
the
strings
were
partly
covered
with
a
cloth
he
lifted
it
and
the
wires
began
to
emit
a
weird
harmony
which
mingled
curiously
with
the
plashing
of
the
wheel
made
it
on
purpose
for
you
miss
garland
he
said
she
thanked
him
very
warmly
for
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
such
an
instrument
before
and
it
interested
her
was
very
thoughtful
of
you
to
make
it
she
added
came
you
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
do
know
exactly
he
replied
as
if
he
did
not
care
to
be
questioned
on
the
point
have
never
made
one
in
my
life
till
now
every
night
after
this
during
the
mournful
gales
of
autumn
the
strange
mixed
music
of
water
wind
and
strings
met
her
ear
swelling
and
sinking
with
an
almost
supernatural
cadence
the
character
of
the
instrument
was
far
enough
removed
from
anything
she
had
hitherto
seen
of
bob
hobbies
so
that
she
marvelled
pleasantly
at
the
new
depths
of
poetry
this
contrivance
revealed
as
existent
in
that
young
seaman
nature
and
allowed
her
emotions
to
flow
out
yet
a
little
further
in
the
old
direction
notwithstanding
her
late
severe
resolve
to
bar
them
back
one
breezy
night
when
the
mill
was
kept
going
into
the
small
hours
and
the
wind
was
exactly
in
the
direction
of
the
the
music
so
mingled
with
her
dreams
as
to
wake
her
it
seemed
to
rhythmically
set
itself
to
the
words
me
think
of
me
she
was
much
impressed
the
sounds
were
almost
too
touching
and
she
spoke
to
bob
the
next
morning
on
the
subject
strange
it
is
that
you
should
have
thought
of
fixing
that
harp
where
the
water
gushes
she
gently
observed
affects
me
almost
painfully
at
night
you
are
poetical
captain
bob
but
it
is
too
too
sad
will
take
it
away
said
captain
bob
promptly
certainly
is
too
sad
i
thought
so
myself
i
myself
was
kept
awake
by
it
one
night
came
you
to
think
of
making
such
a
peculiar
thing
said
bob
is
hardly
worth
saying
why
it
is
not
a
good
place
for
such
a
queer
noisy
machine
and
i
take
it
away
second
thoughts
said
anne
should
like
it
to
remain
a
little
longer
because
it
sets
me
thinking
me
he
asked
with
earnest
frankness
anne
colour
rose
fast
yes
she
said
trying
to
infuse
much
plain
into
her
voice
course
i
am
led
to
think
of
the
person
who
invented
it
bob
seemed
unaccountably
embarrassed
and
the
subject
was
not
pursued
about
later
he
came
to
her
again
with
something
of
an
uneasy
look
was
a
little
matter
i
did
tell
you
just
now
miss
garland
he
said
that
harp
thing
i
mean
i
did
make
it
certainly
but
it
was
my
brother
john
who
asked
me
to
do
it
just
before
he
went
away
john
is
very
musical
as
you
know
and
he
said
it
would
interest
you
but
as
he
did
ask
me
to
tell
i
did
not
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
and
not
have
taken
the
credit
to
myself
it
is
nothing
said
anne
quickly
is
a
very
incomplete
instrument
after
all
and
it
will
be
just
as
well
for
you
to
take
it
away
as
you
first
proposed
he
said
that
he
would
but
he
forgot
to
do
it
that
day
and
the
following
night
there
was
a
high
wind
and
the
harp
cried
and
moaned
so
movingly
that
anne
whose
window
was
quite
near
could
hardly
bear
the
sound
with
its
new
associations
john
loveday
was
present
to
her
mind
all
night
as
an
man
and
yet
she
could
not
own
that
she
had
him
the
harp
was
removed
next
day
bob
feeling
that
his
credit
for
originality
was
damaged
in
her
eyes
by
way
of
recovering
it
set
himself
to
paint
the
which
anne
frequented
and
when
he
came
out
he
assured
her
that
it
was
quite
his
own
idea
wanted
doing
certainly
she
said
in
a
neutral
tone
is
just
about
troublesome
you
ca
quite
reach
up
that
because
you
are
not
very
tall
is
it
not
captain
loveday
never
used
to
say
things
like
that
i
do
mean
that
you
are
much
less
than
tall
shall
i
hold
the
paint
for
you
to
save
your
stepping
down
you
if
you
would
she
took
the
and
stood
looking
at
the
brush
as
it
moved
up
and
down
in
his
hand
hope
i
shall
not
sprinkle
your
fingers
he
observed
as
he
dipped
that
would
not
matter
you
do
it
very
well
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
think
so
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
art
is
demanded
to
paint
a
as
to
paint
a
picture
thinking
that
as
a
painter
daughter
and
a
person
of
education
superior
to
his
own
she
spoke
with
a
flavour
of
sarcasm
he
felt
humbled
and
said
did
not
use
to
talk
like
that
to
me
was
perhaps
too
young
then
to
take
any
pleasure
in
giving
pain
she
observed
daringly
it
give
you
pleasure
anne
nodded
like
to
give
pain
to
people
who
have
given
pain
to
me
she
said
smartly
without
removing
her
eyes
from
the
green
liquid
in
her
hand
ask
your
pardon
for
that
did
say
i
meant
you
though
i
did
mean
you
bob
looked
and
looked
at
her
side
face
till
he
was
bewitched
into
putting
down
his
brush
was
that
stupid
forgetting
of
for
a
time
he
exclaimed
i
had
seen
you
for
so
very
long
consider
how
many
years
o
dear
anne
he
said
advancing
to
take
her
hand
well
we
knew
one
another
when
we
were
children
you
was
a
queen
to
me
then
and
so
you
are
now
and
always
possibly
anne
was
thrilled
pleasantly
enough
at
having
brought
the
truant
village
lad
to
her
feet
again
but
he
was
not
to
find
the
situation
so
easy
as
he
imagined
and
her
hand
was
not
to
be
taken
yet
pretty
she
said
laughing
only
six
weeks
since
miss
johnson
left
do
say
anything
about
that
implored
bob
swear
that
i
never
never
deliberately
loved
her
for
a
long
time
together
that
is
it
was
a
sudden
sort
of
thing
you
know
but
towards
you
i
have
more
or
less
honoured
and
respectfully
loved
you
off
and
on
all
my
life
there
that
true
anne
retorted
quickly
am
willing
off
and
on
to
believe
you
captain
robert
but
i
see
any
good
in
your
making
these
solemn
declarations
me
leave
to
explain
dear
miss
garland
it
is
to
get
you
to
be
pleased
to
renew
an
old
promise
made
years
ago
that
you
think
me
a
word
of
any
promise
will
i
repeat
well
i
wo
urge
only
let
me
beg
of
you
to
get
over
the
quite
wrong
notion
you
have
of
me
and
it
shall
be
my
whole
endeavour
to
fetch
your
gracious
favour
anne
turned
away
from
him
and
entered
the
house
whither
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
followed
her
knocking
at
her
door
and
asking
to
be
let
in
she
said
she
was
busy
whereupon
he
went
away
to
come
back
again
in
a
short
time
and
receive
the
same
answer
have
finished
painting
the
for
you
he
said
through
the
door
can
not
come
to
see
it
i
shall
be
engaged
till
she
heard
him
breathe
a
heavy
sigh
and
withdraw
murmuring
something
about
his
bad
luck
in
being
cut
away
from
the
starn
like
this
but
it
was
not
over
yet
when
came
and
they
sat
down
together
she
took
upon
herself
to
reprove
him
for
what
he
had
said
to
her
in
the
garden
bob
made
his
forehead
express
despair
i
beg
you
this
one
thing
he
said
let
me
know
your
whole
mind
then
i
shall
have
a
chance
to
confess
my
faults
and
mend
them
or
clear
my
conduct
to
your
satisfaction
she
answered
with
quickness
but
not
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
old
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
captain
loveday
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
one
fault
that
perhaps
would
have
been
more
proper
to
my
character
than
to
yours
you
are
too
easily
impressed
by
new
faces
and
that
gives
me
a
of
you
yes
a
that
it
said
bob
slowly
looking
at
her
with
the
intense
respect
of
a
pupil
for
a
master
her
words
being
spoken
in
a
manner
so
precisely
between
jest
and
earnest
that
he
was
in
some
doubt
how
they
were
to
be
received
by
new
faces
it
is
wrong
certainly
of
me
the
popping
of
a
cork
and
the
pouring
out
of
strong
beer
by
the
miller
with
a
view
to
giving
it
a
head
were
apparently
distractions
sufficient
to
excuse
her
in
not
attending
further
to
him
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
sitting
her
gentle
chiding
seemed
to
be
sinking
seriously
into
his
mind
perhaps
her
own
heart
ached
to
see
how
silent
he
was
but
she
had
always
meant
to
punish
him
day
after
day
for
two
or
three
weeks
she
preserved
the
same
demeanour
with
a
which
did
justice
to
her
character
and
on
his
part
considering
what
he
had
to
put
up
with
how
she
eluded
him
snapped
him
off
refused
to
come
out
when
he
called
her
refused
to
see
him
when
he
wanted
to
enter
the
little
parlour
which
she
had
now
appropriated
to
her
private
use
his
patience
testified
strongly
to
his
xxiii
military
preparations
on
an
extended
scale
christmas
had
passed
dreary
winter
with
dark
evenings
had
given
place
to
more
dreary
winter
with
light
evenings
rapid
thaws
had
ended
in
rain
rain
in
wind
wind
in
dust
showery
days
had
come
the
season
of
pink
dawns
and
white
sunsets
and
people
hoped
that
the
march
weather
was
over
the
chief
incident
that
concerned
the
household
at
the
mill
was
that
the
miller
following
the
example
of
all
his
neighbours
had
become
a
volunteer
and
duly
appeared
twice
a
week
in
a
red
military
coat
breeches
black
cloth
gaiters
a
hat
with
a
tuft
of
green
wool
and
epaulettes
of
the
same
colour
and
material
bob
still
remained
neutral
not
being
able
to
decide
whether
to
enrol
himself
as
a
a
local
or
a
volunteer
he
simply
went
on
dancing
attendance
upon
anne
loveday
had
become
awake
to
the
fact
that
the
pair
of
young
people
stood
in
a
curious
attitude
towards
each
other
but
as
they
were
never
seen
with
their
heads
together
and
scarcely
ever
sat
even
in
the
same
room
she
could
not
be
sure
what
their
movements
meant
strangely
enough
or
perhaps
naturally
enough
since
entering
the
loveday
family
herself
she
had
gradually
grown
to
think
less
favourably
of
anne
doing
the
same
thing
and
reverted
to
her
original
idea
of
encouraging
festus
this
more
particularly
because
he
had
of
late
shown
such
perseverance
in
haunting
the
precincts
of
the
mill
presumably
with
the
intention
of
lighting
upon
the
young
girl
but
the
weather
had
kept
her
mostly
indoors
one
afternoon
it
was
raining
in
torrents
such
leaves
as
there
were
on
trees
at
this
time
of
year
those
of
the
laurel
and
other
evergreens
staggered
beneath
the
hard
blows
of
the
drops
which
fell
upon
them
and
afterwards
could
be
seen
trickling
down
the
stems
beneath
and
silently
entering
the
ground
the
surface
of
the
leapt
up
in
a
thousand
spirts
under
the
same
downfall
and
clucked
like
a
hen
in
the
along
the
banks
as
it
undulated
under
the
wind
the
only
dry
spot
visible
from
the
front
windows
of
the
was
the
inside
of
a
small
shed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
courtyard
while
loveday
was
noticing
the
threads
of
rain
descending
across
its
interior
shade
festus
derriman
walked
up
and
entered
it
for
shelter
which
owing
to
the
lumber
within
it
but
scantily
afforded
to
a
man
who
would
have
been
a
match
for
one
of
frederick
william
patagonians
it
was
an
excellent
opportunity
for
helping
on
her
scheme
anne
was
in
the
back
room
and
by
asking
him
in
till
the
rain
was
over
she
would
bring
him
face
to
face
with
her
daughter
whom
as
the
days
went
on
she
increasingly
wished
to
marry
other
than
a
loveday
now
that
the
romance
of
her
own
alliance
with
the
millet
had
in
some
respects
worn
off
she
was
better
provided
for
than
before
she
was
not
unhappy
but
the
plain
fact
was
that
she
had
married
beneath
her
she
beckoned
to
festus
through
the
he
instantly
complied
with
her
signal
having
in
fact
placed
himself
there
on
purpose
to
be
noticed
for
he
knew
that
miss
garland
would
not
be
on
such
a
day
afternoon
loveday
said
festus
on
entering
now
if
i
did
think
that
how
it
would
be
his
voice
had
suddenly
warmed
to
anger
for
he
had
seen
a
door
close
in
the
back
part
of
the
room
a
lithe
figure
having
previously
slipped
through
loveday
turned
observed
that
anne
was
gone
and
said
is
it
as
if
she
did
not
know
nothing
nothing
said
festus
crossly
know
well
enough
what
it
is
only
you
make
pretence
otherwise
but
i
bring
her
to
book
yet
you
shall
drop
your
haughty
airs
my
charmer
she
little
thinks
i
have
kept
an
account
of
all
you
must
treat
her
politely
sir
said
loveday
secretly
pleased
at
these
signs
of
uncontrollable
affection
tell
me
of
politeness
or
generosity
she
is
more
than
a
match
for
me
she
regularly
gets
over
me
i
have
passed
by
this
house
times
since
last
martinmas
and
this
is
all
my
reward
you
will
stay
till
the
rain
is
over
sir
i
do
mind
rain
i
off
again
she
got
somebody
else
in
her
eye
and
the
yeoman
went
out
slamming
the
door
meanwhile
the
slippery
object
of
his
hopes
had
gone
along
the
dark
passage
passed
the
trap
which
opened
on
the
wheel
and
through
the
door
into
the
mill
where
she
was
met
by
bob
who
looked
up
from
the
shoot
inquiringly
and
said
want
me
miss
garland
no
said
she
only
want
to
be
allowed
to
stand
here
a
few
minutes
he
looked
at
her
to
know
if
she
meant
it
and
finding
that
she
did
returned
to
his
post
when
the
mill
had
rumbled
on
a
little
longer
he
came
back
she
said
when
she
saw
him
move
that
you
are
at
work
and
have
no
time
to
stand
close
to
me
he
bowed
and
went
to
his
original
post
again
anne
watching
from
the
window
till
festus
should
leave
the
mill
rumbled
on
as
before
and
at
last
bob
came
to
her
for
the
third
time
bob
she
began
my
honour
is
only
to
ask
a
question
will
you
walk
with
me
to
church
next
sunday
afternoon
i
will
she
said
but
at
this
moment
the
yeoman
left
the
house
and
anne
to
escape
further
parley
returned
to
the
dwelling
by
the
way
she
had
come
sunday
afternoon
arrived
and
the
family
was
standing
at
the
door
waiting
for
the
church
bells
to
begin
from
that
side
of
the
house
they
could
see
southward
across
a
paddock
to
the
rising
ground
further
ahead
where
there
grew
a
large
beneath
whose
boughs
footpaths
crossed
in
different
directions
like
meridians
at
the
pole
the
tree
was
old
and
in
summer
the
grass
beneath
it
was
quite
trodden
away
by
the
feet
of
the
many
trysters
and
idlers
who
haunted
the
spot
the
tree
formed
a
conspicuous
object
in
the
surrounding
landscape
while
they
looked
a
foot
soldier
in
red
uniform
and
white
breeches
came
along
one
of
the
paths
and
stopping
beneath
the
elm
took
from
his
pocket
a
paper
which
he
proceeded
to
nail
up
by
the
four
corners
to
the
trunk
he
drew
back
looked
at
it
and
went
on
his
way
bob
got
his
glass
from
indoors
and
levelled
it
at
the
placard
but
after
looking
for
a
long
time
he
could
make
out
nothing
but
a
lion
and
a
unicorn
at
the
top
anne
who
was
ready
for
church
moved
away
from
the
door
though
it
was
yet
early
and
showed
her
intention
of
going
by
way
of
the
elm
the
paper
had
been
so
impressively
nailed
up
that
she
was
curious
to
read
it
even
at
this
theological
time
bob
took
the
opportunity
of
following
and
reminded
her
of
her
promise
walk
behind
me
not
at
all
close
she
said
he
replied
immediately
dropping
behind
the
ludicrous
humility
of
his
manner
led
her
to
add
playfully
over
her
shoulder
serves
you
right
you
know
deserve
anything
but
i
must
take
the
liberty
to
say
that
i
hope
my
behaviour
about
matil
in
forgetting
you
awhile
will
not
make
ye
wish
to
keep
me
behind
she
replied
confidentially
i
am
so
earnest
not
to
be
seen
with
you
is
that
i
may
appear
to
people
to
be
independent
of
you
knowing
what
i
do
of
your
weaknesses
i
can
do
no
otherwise
you
must
be
schooled
into
anne
sighed
bob
hit
me
hard
too
hard
if
ever
i
do
win
you
i
am
sure
i
shall
have
fairly
earned
you
are
not
what
you
once
seemed
to
be
she
returned
softly
quite
like
to
let
myself
love
you
the
last
words
were
not
very
audible
and
as
bob
was
behind
he
caught
nothing
of
them
nor
did
he
see
how
sentimental
she
had
become
all
of
a
sudden
they
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
in
silence
and
coming
to
the
tree
read
as
follows
address
to
all
ranks
and
descriptions
of
englishmen
friends
and
countrymen
the
french
are
now
assembling
the
largest
force
that
ever
was
prepared
to
invade
this
kingdom
with
the
professed
purpose
of
effecting
our
complete
ruin
and
destruction
they
do
not
disguise
their
intentions
as
they
have
often
done
to
other
countries
but
openly
boast
that
they
will
come
over
in
such
numbers
as
can
not
be
resisted
wherever
the
french
have
lately
appeared
they
have
spared
neither
rich
nor
poor
old
nor
young
but
like
a
destructive
pestilence
have
laid
waste
and
destroyed
every
thing
that
before
was
fair
and
flourishing
on
this
occasion
no
man
service
is
compelled
but
you
are
invited
voluntarily
to
come
forward
in
defence
of
everything
that
is
dear
to
you
by
entering
your
names
on
the
lists
which
are
sent
to
the
man
of
every
parish
and
engaging
to
act
either
as
volunteers
bearing
pioneers
and
or
as
of
as
associated
volunteers
you
will
be
called
out
only
once
a
week
unless
the
actual
landing
of
the
enemy
should
render
your
further
services
necessary
as
pioneers
or
labourers
you
will
be
employed
in
breaking
up
roads
to
hinder
the
enemy
advance
those
who
have
pickaxes
spades
shovels
or
other
working
implements
are
desired
to
mention
them
to
the
constable
or
man
of
their
parish
in
order
that
they
may
be
entered
on
the
lists
opposite
their
homes
to
be
used
if
necessary
it
is
thought
desirable
to
give
you
this
explanation
that
you
may
not
be
ignorant
of
the
duties
to
which
you
may
be
called
but
if
the
love
of
true
liberty
and
honest
fame
has
not
ceased
to
animate
the
hearts
of
englishmen
pay
though
necessary
will
be
the
least
part
of
your
reward
you
will
find
your
best
recompense
in
having
done
your
duty
to
your
king
and
country
by
driving
back
or
destroying
your
old
and
implacable
enemy
envious
of
your
freedom
and
happiness
and
therefore
seeking
to
destroy
them
in
having
protected
your
wives
and
children
from
death
or
worse
than
death
which
will
follow
the
success
of
such
inveterate
foes
rouse
therefore
and
unite
as
one
man
in
the
best
of
causes
united
we
may
defy
the
world
to
conquer
us
but
victory
will
never
belong
to
those
who
are
slothful
and
unprepared
must
go
and
join
at
once
said
bob
anne
turned
to
him
all
the
playfulness
gone
from
her
face
wish
we
lived
in
the
north
of
england
bob
so
as
to
be
further
away
from
where
he
land
she
murmured
uneasily
we
are
would
be
paradise
to
me
if
you
would
only
make
it
so
is
not
right
to
talk
so
lightly
at
such
a
serious
time
she
thoughtfully
returned
going
on
towards
the
church
on
drawing
near
they
saw
through
the
boughs
of
a
clump
of
intervening
trees
still
leafless
but
bursting
into
buds
of
amber
hue
a
glittering
which
seemed
to
be
reflected
from
points
of
steel
in
a
few
moments
they
heard
above
the
tender
chiming
of
the
church
bells
the
loud
voice
of
a
man
giving
words
of
command
at
which
all
the
metallic
points
suddenly
shifted
like
the
bristles
of
a
porcupine
and
glistened
anew
the
drilling
said
loveday
drill
now
between
the
services
you
know
because
they
ca
get
the
men
together
so
readily
in
the
week
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
ought
to
be
doing
more
than
i
am
when
they
had
passed
round
the
belt
of
trees
the
company
of
recruits
became
visible
consisting
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
hamlets
thereabout
more
or
less
known
to
bob
and
anne
they
were
assembled
on
the
green
plot
outside
the
dressed
in
their
common
clothes
and
the
sergeant
who
had
been
putting
them
through
their
drill
was
the
man
who
nailed
up
the
proclamation
he
was
now
engaged
in
untying
a
canvas
from
which
he
drew
forth
a
handful
of
shillings
giving
one
to
each
man
in
payment
for
his
attendance
i
dismissed
ye
too
soon
parade
parade
again
i
say
he
cried
watch
is
fast
i
find
there
another
twenty
minutes
afore
the
worship
of
god
commences
now
all
of
you
that
got
firelocks
fall
in
at
the
lower
end
eyes
right
and
dress
as
every
man
was
anxious
to
see
how
the
rest
stood
those
at
the
end
of
the
line
pressed
forward
for
that
purpose
till
the
line
assumed
the
form
of
a
bow
at
ye
now
why
you
are
all
a
crooking
in
dress
dress
they
dressed
forthwith
but
impelled
by
the
same
motive
they
soon
resumed
their
former
figure
and
so
they
were
despairingly
permitted
to
remain
i
hope
you
have
a
little
patience
said
the
sergeant
as
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
arc
pay
strict
attention
to
the
word
of
command
just
exactly
as
i
give
it
out
to
ye
and
if
i
should
go
wrong
i
shall
be
much
obliged
to
any
friend
who
put
me
right
again
for
i
have
only
been
in
the
army
three
weeks
myself
and
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
we
be
so
we
be
said
the
line
heartily
the
whole
then
poise
fawlocks
very
well
done
what
must
we
do
that
have
got
no
firelocks
said
the
lower
end
of
the
line
in
a
helpless
voice
was
ever
such
a
question
why
you
must
do
nothing
at
all
but
think
you
poise
you
had
you
middle
men
that
are
armed
with
and
just
to
must
of
course
use
as
if
they
were
the
real
thing
now
then
cock
fawlocks
present
fire
pretend
to
i
mean
and
the
same
time
throw
yer
imagination
into
the
field
o
battle
very
good
very
good
indeed
except
that
some
of
you
were
a
too
soon
and
the
rest
a
too
late
sergeant
can
i
fall
out
as
i
am
in
the
choir
and
my
strings
wo
stand
at
this
time
o
year
unless
they
be
screwed
up
a
little
before
the
passon
comes
in
can
you
think
of
such
trifles
as
churchgoing
at
such
a
time
as
this
when
your
own
native
country
is
on
the
point
of
invasion
said
the
sergeant
sternly
as
you
know
the
drill
ends
three
minutes
afore
church
begins
and
that
the
law
and
it
wants
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yet
now
at
the
word
shake
the
powder
supposing
you
got
it
into
the
three
last
fingers
behind
the
rammer
then
shut
your
pans
drawing
your
right
arm
towards
your
body
i
ought
to
have
told
ye
before
this
that
at
your
seize
it
and
bring
it
with
a
quick
motion
to
your
mouth
bite
the
top
well
off
and
do
swaller
so
much
of
the
powder
as
to
make
ye
hawk
and
spet
instead
of
attending
to
your
drill
what
that
man
of
in
the
rear
rank
sir
is
anthony
cripplestraw
wanting
to
know
how
he
to
bite
off
his
katridge
when
he
have
a
tooth
left
in
head
why
what
your
genius
for
war
hold
it
up
to
your
man
mouth
to
be
sure
and
let
him
nip
it
off
for
ye
well
what
have
you
to
say
private
tremlett
do
ye
understand
english
yer
pardon
sergeant
but
what
must
we
infantry
of
the
awkward
squad
do
if
boney
comes
afore
we
get
our
firelocks
a
pike
like
the
rest
of
the
incapables
you
find
a
store
of
them
ready
in
the
corner
of
the
church
tower
now
then
shoulder
r
r
r
they
be
tinging
in
the
passon
exclaimed
david
miller
man
who
also
formed
one
of
the
company
as
the
bells
changed
from
chiming
all
three
together
to
a
quick
beating
of
one
the
whole
line
drew
a
breath
of
relief
threw
down
their
arms
and
began
running
off
then
i
must
dismiss
ye
said
the
sergeant
back
come
back
next
drill
is
tuesday
afternoon
at
four
and
mind
if
your
masters
wo
let
ye
leave
work
soon
enough
tell
me
and
i
write
a
line
to
to
the
right
left
wheel
i
mean
no
no
right
wheel
mar
r
r
rch
some
wheeled
to
the
right
and
some
to
the
left
and
some
obliging
men
including
cripplestraw
tried
to
wheel
both
ways
stop
try
again
and
comrades
unfortunately
when
i
in
a
hurry
i
can
never
remember
my
right
hand
from
my
left
and
never
could
as
a
boy
you
must
excuse
me
please
practice
makes
perfect
as
the
saying
is
and
much
as
i
learnt
since
i
we
always
find
something
new
now
then
right
wheel
march
halt
stand
at
ease
dismiss
i
think
that
the
order
but
i
look
in
the
book
afore
tuesday
many
of
the
company
who
had
been
drilled
preferred
to
go
off
and
spend
their
shillings
instead
of
entering
the
church
but
anne
and
captain
bob
passed
in
even
the
interior
of
the
sacred
edifice
was
affected
by
the
agitation
of
the
times
the
religion
of
the
country
had
in
fact
changed
from
love
of
god
to
hatred
of
napoleon
buonaparte
and
as
if
to
remind
the
devout
of
this
alteration
the
pikes
for
the
pikemen
all
those
accepted
men
who
were
not
otherwise
armed
were
kept
in
the
church
of
each
parish
there
against
the
wall
they
always
stood
a
whole
sheaf
of
them
formed
of
new
ash
stems
with
a
spike
driven
in
at
one
end
the
stick
being
preserved
from
splitting
by
a
ferule
and
there
they
remained
year
after
year
in
the
corner
of
the
aisle
till
they
were
removed
and
placed
under
the
gallery
stairs
and
thence
ultimately
to
the
belfry
where
they
grew
black
rusty
and
and
were
gradually
stolen
and
carried
off
by
sextons
parish
clerks
whitewashers
and
other
church
servants
for
use
at
home
as
staves
and
in
which
degraded
situations
they
may
still
occasionally
be
found
but
in
their
new
and
shining
state
they
had
a
terror
for
anne
whose
eyes
were
involuntarily
drawn
towards
them
as
she
sat
at
bob
side
during
the
service
filling
her
with
bloody
visions
of
their
possible
use
not
far
from
the
very
spot
on
which
they
were
now
assembled
the
sermon
too
was
on
the
subject
of
patriotism
so
that
when
they
came
out
she
began
to
harp
uneasily
upon
the
probability
of
their
all
being
driven
from
their
homes
bob
assured
her
that
with
the
sixty
thousand
regulars
the
militia
reserve
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
and
the
three
hundred
thousand
volunteers
there
was
not
much
to
fear
i
sometimes
have
a
fear
that
poor
john
will
be
killed
he
continued
after
a
pause
is
sure
to
be
among
the
first
that
will
have
to
face
the
invaders
and
the
trumpeters
get
picked
off
is
the
same
chance
for
him
as
for
the
others
said
anne
yes
the
same
chance
such
as
it
is
you
have
never
liked
john
since
that
affair
of
matilda
johnson
have
you
she
quickly
asked
said
bob
timidly
it
is
a
ticklish
time
for
him
would
it
not
be
worth
while
to
make
up
any
differences
before
the
crash
comes
have
nothing
to
make
up
said
anne
with
some
distress
she
still
fully
believed
the
to
have
smuggled
away
miss
johnson
because
of
his
own
interest
in
that
lady
which
must
have
made
his
professions
to
herself
a
mere
pastime
but
that
very
conduct
had
in
it
the
curious
advantage
to
herself
of
setting
bob
free
john
has
been
gone
continued
her
companion
have
found
out
more
of
his
meaning
and
of
what
he
really
had
to
do
with
that
flight
did
you
know
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
got
her
to
go
away
she
looked
at
bob
with
surprise
he
was
not
exasperated
with
john
and
yet
he
knew
so
much
as
this
she
said
did
it
mean
he
did
not
explain
to
her
then
but
the
possibility
of
john
death
which
had
been
newly
brought
home
to
him
by
the
military
events
of
the
day
determined
him
to
get
poor
john
character
cleared
reproaching
himself
for
letting
her
remain
so
long
with
a
mistaken
idea
of
him
bob
went
to
his
father
as
soon
as
they
got
home
and
begged
him
to
get
loveday
to
tell
anne
the
true
reason
of
john
objection
to
miss
johnson
as
a
thinks
it
is
because
they
were
old
lovers
new
met
and
that
he
wants
to
marry
her
he
exclaimed
to
his
father
in
conclusion
the
meaning
of
the
split
between
miss
nancy
and
jack
said
the
miller
were
they
any
more
than
common
friends
asked
bob
uneasily
on
her
side
perhaps
we
must
do
it
replied
bob
painfully
conscious
that
common
justice
to
john
might
bring
them
into
hazardous
rivalry
yet
determined
to
be
fair
it
all
to
loveday
and
get
her
to
tell
anne
xxiv
a
letter
a
visitor
and
a
tin
box
the
result
of
the
explanation
upon
anne
was
bitter
she
was
so
sorry
at
having
wronged
the
kindly
soldier
that
next
morning
she
went
by
herself
to
the
down
and
stood
exactly
where
his
tent
had
covered
the
sod
on
which
he
had
lain
so
many
nights
thinking
what
sadness
he
must
have
suffered
because
of
her
at
the
time
of
packing
up
and
going
away
after
that
she
wiped
from
her
eyes
the
tears
of
pity
which
had
come
there
descended
to
the
house
and
wrote
an
impulsive
letter
to
him
in
which
occurred
the
following
passages
indiscreet
enough
under
the
circumstances
find
all
justice
all
rectitude
on
your
side
john
and
all
impertinence
all
inconsiderateness
on
mine
i
am
so
much
convinced
of
your
honour
in
the
whole
transaction
that
i
shall
for
the
future
mistrust
myself
in
everything
and
if
it
be
possible
whenever
i
differ
from
you
on
any
point
i
shall
take
an
hour
time
for
consideration
before
i
say
that
i
differ
if
i
have
lost
your
friendship
i
have
only
myself
to
thank
for
it
but
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
can
forgive
after
writing
this
she
went
to
the
garden
where
bob
was
shearing
the
spring
grass
from
the
paths
is
john
direction
she
said
holding
the
sealed
letter
in
her
hand
barracks
bob
faltered
his
countenance
sinking
she
thanked
him
and
went
indoors
when
he
came
in
later
in
the
day
he
passed
the
door
of
her
empty
and
saw
the
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
he
disliked
the
sight
of
it
hearing
voices
in
the
other
room
he
entered
and
found
anne
and
her
mother
there
talking
to
cripplestraw
who
had
just
come
in
with
a
message
from
squire
derriman
requesting
miss
garland
as
she
valued
the
peace
of
mind
of
an
old
and
troubled
man
to
go
at
once
and
see
him
can
not
go
she
said
not
liking
the
risk
that
such
a
visit
involved
an
hour
later
cripplestraw
shambled
again
into
the
passage
on
the
same
errand
very
poorly
and
he
hopes
that
you
come
anne
he
wants
to
see
very
particular
about
the
french
anne
would
have
gone
in
a
moment
but
for
the
fear
that
some
one
besides
the
farmer
might
encounter
her
and
she
answered
as
before
another
hour
passed
and
the
wheels
of
a
vehicle
were
heard
cripplestraw
had
come
for
the
third
time
with
a
horse
and
gig
he
was
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
and
brought
with
him
on
this
occasion
a
basket
containing
raisins
almonds
oranges
and
sweet
cakes
offering
them
to
her
as
a
gift
from
the
old
farmer
he
repeated
his
request
for
her
to
accompany
him
the
gig
and
best
mare
having
been
sent
as
an
additional
inducement
believe
the
old
gentleman
is
in

instead

letter

the
and

added
he
said
yes
and
went
out

to
the
door
till
she
should
be
ready

an
encouragement

foolish
girl
anne

see
instantly

she
said
robert
that
he
need
not

she
went
to
her
room
to
secure
the
letter
it
was
gone
from
the
mantelpiece
and
on
inquiry
it
was
found
that
the
miller
seeing
it
there
had
sent
david
with
it
to
budmouth
hours
ago
anne
said
nothing
and
set
out
for
oxwell
hall
with
cripplestraw

and
bob
had
resumed

doggedly
if

bob
and
has
been
for
years
and
he
with
her
asked
his
wife
triumphantly
love
with
bob
and
he
with
her
repeated
loveday
said
she
going
off
and
leaving
him
to
his
reflections
when
anne
reached
the
hall
she
found
old
derriman
in
his
customary
chair
his
complexion
was
more
ashen
but
his
movement
in
rising
at
her
entrance
putting
a
chair
and
shutting
the
door
behind
her
were
much
the
same
as
usual
god
you
come
my
dear
girl
he
said
earnestly

across
to
read
to
me

much
to
fetch
you
fie
a
horse
and
gig
and
a
man
time
in
going
three
times

what
i
sent
ye

deal
in

to
speak
about
now
do
ye
come
this
way
such
things
as
those
she
returned
with
surprise
understand
those
things
at
all
nothing
to
understand
is
just
this
the
french
will
be
here
within
two
months
that
certain
i
have
it
on
the
best
authority
that
the
army
at
boulogne
is
ready
the
boats
equipped
the
plans
laid
and
the
first
consul
only
waits
for
a
tide
heaven
knows
what
will
become
the
men
o
these
parts
but
most
likely
the
women
will
he
spared
now
i
show
he
led
her
across
the
hall
to
a
stone
staircase
of
plan
which
conducted
to
the
cellars
here
she
said
i
must
trouble
ye
to
come
down
here
i
have
thought
and
thought
who
is
the
woman
that
can
best
keep
a
secret
for
six
months
and
i
say
anne
garland
you
wo
be
married
before
then
no
murmured
the
young
woman
would
expect
ye
to
keep
a
close
tongue
after
such
a
thing
as
that
but
it
will
not
be
necessary
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
he
struck
a
light
from
a
box
and
unlocked
the
middle
one
of
three
doors
which
appeared
in
the
whitewashed
wall
opposite
the
rays
of
the
candle
fell
upon
the
vault
and
sides
of
a
long
low
cellar
littered
with
decayed
woodwork
from
other
parts
of
the
hall
among
the
rest
carved
finials
tracery
panels
and
wainscoting
but
what
most
attracted
her
eye
was
a
small
flagstone
turned
up
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
heap
of
earth
beside
it
and
a
derriman
went
to
the
corner
of
the
cellar
and
pulled
out
a
clamped
box
from
under
the
straw
be
rather
heavy
my
dear
eh
he
said
affectionately
addressing
the
box
as
he
lifted
it
you
are
going
to
be
put
in
a
safe
place
you
know
or
that
rascal
will
get
hold
of
ye
and
carry
ye
off
and
ruin
me
he
then
with
some
difficulty
lowered
the
box
into
the
hole
raked
in
the
earth
upon
it
and
lowered
the
flagstone
which
he
was
a
long
time
in
fixing
to
his
satisfaction
miss
garland
who
was
romantically
interested
helped
him
to
brush
away
the
fragments
of
loose
earth
and
when
he
had
scattered
over
the
floor
a
little
of
the
straw
that
lay
about
they
again
ascended
to
upper
air
this
all
sir
said
anne
a
moment
longer
honey
will
you
come
into
the
great
parlour
she
followed
him
thither
anything
happens
to
me
while
the
fighting
is
going
on
it
may
be
on
these
very
fields
you
will
know
what
to
do
he
resumed
first
please
sit
down
again
there
a
dear
whilst
i
write
what
in
my
head
see
there
the
best
paper
and
a
new
quill
that
i
afforded
myself
a
strange
business
i
do
think
i
much
like
it
derriman
she
said
seating
herself
he
had
by
this
time
begun
to
write
and
murmured
as
he
wrote
and
a
half
from
sixteen
and
from
there
that
all
now
i
seal
it
up
and
give
it
to
you
to
keep
safe
till
i
ask
ye
for
it
or
you
hear
of
my
being
trampled
down
by
the
enemy
does
it
mean
she
asked
as
she
received
the
paper
ha
ha
why
that
the
distance
of
the
box
from
the
two
corners
of
the
cellar
i
measured
it
before
you
came
and
my
honey
to
make
all
sure
if
the
french
soldiery
are
after
ye
tell
your
mother
the
meaning
o
or
any
other
friend
in
case
they
should
put
ye
to
death
and
the
secret
be
lost
but
that
i
am
sure
i
hope
they
wo
do
though
your
pretty
face
will
be
a
sad
bait
to
the
soldiers
i
often
have
wished
you
was
my
daughter
honey
and
yet
in
these
times
the
less
cares
a
man
has
the
better
so
i
am
glad
you
bai
shall
my
man
drive
you
home
no
she
said
much
depressed
by
the
words
he
had
uttered
can
find
my
way
you
need
not
trouble
to
come
down
take
care
of
the
paper
and
if
you
outlive
me
you
find
i
have
not
forgot
you
xxv
festus
shows
his
love
festus
derriman
had
remained
in
the
royal
all
that
day
his
horse
being
sick
at
stables
but
wishing
to
coax
or
bully
from
his
uncle
a
remount
for
the
coming
summer
he
set
off
on
foot
for
oxwell
early
in
the
evening
when
he
drew
near
to
the
village
or
rather
to
the
hall
which
was
a
mile
from
the
village
he
overtook
a
slim
woman
sauntering
along
at
a
leisurely
pace
she
was
fashionably
dressed
in
a
green
spencer
with
sleeves
and
wore
a
velvet
spanish
hat
and
feather
afternoon
said
festus
throwing
a
air
into
his
greeting
are
out
for
a
walk
out
for
a
walk
captain
said
the
lady
who
had
criticized
him
from
the
crevice
of
her
eye
without
seeming
to
do
much
more
than
continue
her
demure
look
forward
and
gave
the
title
as
a
sop
to
his
apparent
character
the
town
i
swear
it
my
honour
i
would
i
am
from
the
town

she
you

a

fact

be
quite
dependent
upon
us
for
their
deliverance
in
the
coming
struggle
we
hold
our
lives
in
our
hands
and
theirs
i
may
say
in
our
pockets
what
made
you
come
here
at
such
a
critical
time
do
see
that
it
is
such
a
critical
time
it
is
though
and
so
you
say
if
you
was
as
much
mixed
up
with
the
military
affairs
of
the
nation
as
some
of
us
the
lady
smiled
king
is
coming
this
year
anyhow
said
she
said
festus
firmly
you
are
one
of
the
attendants
at
court
perhaps
come
on
ahead
to
get
the
king
chambers
ready
in
case
boney

not
land
she
said
am
connected
with
the
theatre
though
not
just
at
the
present
moment
i
have
been
out
of
luck
for
the
last
year
or
two
but
i
have
fetched
up
again
i
join
the
company
when
they
arrive
for
the
season
festus
surveyed
her
with
interest
and
is
it
so
well
what
part
do
you
play
am
mostly
the
leading
lady
the
heroine
she
said
drawing
herself
up
with
dignity
come
and
have
a
look
at
ye
if
all
well
and
the
landing
is
put
off
hang
me
if
i
do
hullo
hullo
what
do
i
see
his
eyes
were
stretched
towards
a
distant
field
which
anne
garland
was
at
that
moment
hastily
crossing
on
her
way
from
the
hall
to
overcombe
must
be
off
to
ye
dear
creature
he
exclaimed
hurrying
forward
the
lady
said
you
droll
monster
as
she
smiled
and
watched
him
stride
ahead
festus
bounded
on
over
the
hedge
across
the
intervening
patch
of
green
and
into
the
field
which
anne
was
still
crossing
in
a
moment
or
two
she
looked
back
and
seeing
the
herculean
figure
of
the
yeoman
behind
her
felt
rather
alarmed
though
she
determined
to
show
no
difference
in
her
outward
carriage
but
to
maintain
her
natural
gait
was
beyond
her
powers
she
spasmodically
quickened
her
pace
fruitlessly
however
for
he
gained
upon
her
and
when
within
a
few
strides
of
her
exclaimed
my
darling
anne
started
off
at
a
run
festus
was
already
out
of
breath
and
soon
found
that
he
was
not
likely
to
overtake
her
on
she
went
without
turning
her
head
till
an
unusual
noise
behind
compelled
her
to
look
round
his
face
was
in
the
act
of
falling
back
he
swerved
on
one
side
and
dropped
like
a
log
upon
a
convenient
which
bordered
the
path
there
he
lay
quite
still
anne
was
somewhat
alarmed
and
after
standing
at
gaze
for
two
or
three
minutes
drew
nearer
to
him
a
step
and
a
half
at
a
time
wondering
and
doubting
as
a
meek
ewe
draws
near
to
some
strolling
vagabond
who
flings
himself
on
the
grass
near
the
flock
is
in
a
swoon
she
murmured
her
heart
beat
quickly
and
she
looked
around
nobody
was
in
sight
she
advanced
a
step
nearer
still
and
observed
him
again
apparently
his
face
was
turning
to
a
livid
hue
and
his
breathing
had
become
obstructed
not
a
swoon
is
apoplexy
she
said
in
deep
distress
ought
to
untie
his
neck
but
she
was
afraid
to
do
this
and
only
drew
a
little
closer
still
miss
garland
was
now
within
three
feet
of
him
whereupon
the
senseless
man
who
could
hold
his
breath
no
longer
sprang
to
his
feet
and
darted
at
her
saying
ha
a
scheme
for
a
kiss
she
felt
his
arm
slipping
round
her
neck
but
twirling
about
with
amazing
dexterity
she
wriggled
from
his
embrace
and
ran
away
along
the
field
the
force
with
which
she
had
extricated
herself
was
sufficient
to
throw
festus
upon
the
grass
and
by
the
time
that
he
got
upon
his
legs
again
she
was
many
yards
off
uttering
a
word
which
was
not
exactly
a
blessing
he
immediately
gave
chase
and
thus
they
ran
till
anne
entered
a
meadow
divided
down
the
middle
by
a
brook
about
six
feet
wide
a
narrow
plank
was
thrown
loosely
across
at
the
point
where
the
path
traversed
this
stream
and
when
anne
reached
it
she
at
once
scampered
over
at
the
other
side
she
turned
her
head
to
gather
the
probabilities
of
the
situation
which
were
that
festus
derriman
would
overtake
her
even
now
by
a
sudden
forethought
she
stooped
seized
the
end
of
the
plank
and
endeavoured
to
drag
it
away
from
the
opposite
bank
but
the
weight
was
too
great
for
her
to
do
more
than
slightly
move
it
and
with
a
desperate
sigh
she
ran
on
again
having
lost
many
valuable
seconds
but
her
attempt
though
ineffectual
in
dragging
it
down
had
been
enough
to
unsettle
the
little
bridge
and
when
derriman
reached
the
middle
which
he
did
half
a
minute
later
the
plank
turned
over
on
its
edge
tilting
him
bodily
into
the
river
the
water
was
not
remarkably
deep
but
as
the
yeoman
fell
flat
on
his
stomach
he
was
completely
immersed
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
drag
himself
out
when
he
arose
dripping
on
the
bank
and
looked
around
anne
had
vanished
from
the
mead
then
festus
eyes
glowed
like
carbuncles
and
he
gave
voice
to
fearful
imprecations
shaking
his
fist
in
the
soft
summer
air
towards
anne
in
a
way
that
was
terrible
for
any
maiden
to
behold
wading
back
through
the
stream
he
walked
along
its
bank
with
a
heavy
tread
the
water
running
from
his
wrists
and
the
tips
of
his
ears
in
silvery
dribbles
that
sparkled
pleasantly
in
the
sun
thus
he
hastened
away
and
went
round
by
a
to
the
hall
meanwhile
the
author
of
his
troubles
was
rapidly
drawing
nearer
to
the
mill
and
soon
to
her
inexpressible
delight
she
saw
bob
coming
to
meet
her
she
had
heard
the
flounce
and
feeling
more
secure
from
her
pursuer
had
dropped
her
pace
to
a
quick
walk
no
sooner
did
she
reach
bob
than
overcome
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
bob
instantly
enclosed
her
in
an
embrace
so
very
thorough
that
there
was
no
possible
danger
of
her
falling
whatever
degree
of
exhaustion
might
have
given
rise
to
her
somewhat
unexpected
action
and
in
this
attitude
they
silently
remained
till
it
was
borne
in
upon
anne
that
the
present
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
ever
been
in
such
a
position
her
face
then
burnt
like
a
sunset
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
look
up
at
him
feeling
at
length
quite
safe
she
suddenly
resolved
not
to
give
way
to
her
first
impulse
to
tell
him
the
whole
of
what
had
happened
lest
there
should
be
a
dreadful
quarrel
and
fight
between
bob
and
the
yeoman
and
great
difficulties
caused
in
the
loveday
family
on
her
account
the
miller
having
important
wheat
transactions
with
the
derrimans
seem
frightened
dearest
anne
said
bob
tenderly
she
replied
saw
a
man
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
and
he
was
inclined
to
follow
me
but
worse
than
that
i
am
troubled
about
the
french
o
bob
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
killed
and
my
mother
and
john
and
your
father
and
all
of
us
hunted
down
i
have
told
you
dear
little
heart
that
it
can
not
be
we
shall
drive
into
the
sea
after
a
battle
or
two
even
if
they
land
which
i
do
believe
they
will
we
got
ninety
sail
of
the
line
and
though
it
is
rather
unfortunate
that
we
should
have
declared
war
against
spain
at
this
ticklish
time
there
enough
for
all
and
bob
went
into
elaborate
statistics
of
the
navy
army
militia
and
volunteers
to
prolong
the
time
of
holding
her
when
he
had
done
speaking
he
drew
rather
a
heavy
sigh
the
matter
bob
have
been
yet
to
offer
myself
as
a
and
i
ought
to
have
done
it
long
ago
are
only
one
surely
they
can
do
without
you
bob
shook
his
head
she
arose
from
her
restful
position
her
eye
catching
his
with
a
shamefaced
expression
of
having
given
way
at
last
loveday
drew
from
his
pocket
a
paper
and
said
as
they
slowly
walked
on
something
to
make
us
brave
and
patriotic
i
bought
it
in
budmouth
is
it
a
stirring
picture
it
was
a
hieroglyphic
profile
of
napoleon
the
hat
represented
a
maimed
french
eagle
the
face
was
ingeniously
made
up
of
human
carcases
knotted
and
writhing
together
in
such
directions
as
to
form
a
physiognomy
a
band
or
stock
shaped
to
resemble
the
english
channel
encircled
his
throat
and
seemed
to
choke
him
his
epaulette
was
a
hand
tearing
a
cobweb
that
represented
the
treaty
of
peace
with
england
and
his
ear
was
a
woman
crouching
over
a
dying
child
is
dreadful
said
anne
do
like
to
see
it
she
had
recovered
from
her
emotion
and
walked
along
beside
him
with
a
grave
subdued
face
bob
did
not
like
to
assume
the
privileges
of
an
accepted
lover
and
draw
her
hand
through
his
arm
for
conscious
that
she
naturally
belonged
to
a
politer
grade
than
his
own
he
feared
lest
her
exhibition
of
tenderness
were
an
impulse
which
cooler
moments
might
regret
a
perfect
life
had
not
absolutely
set
in
for
him
as
yet
and
it
was
not
to
be
hastened
by
force
when
they
had
passed
over
the
bridge
into
the
they
saw
the
miller
standing
at
the
door
with
a
face
of
concern
you
have
been
gone
he
said
government
man
has
been
here
and
to
all
the
houses
taking
down
the
numbers
of
the
women
and
children
and
their
ages
and
the
number
of
horses
and
waggons
that
can
be
mustered
in
case
they
have
to
retreat
inland
out
of
the
way
of
the
invading
army
the
little
family
gathered
themselves
together
all
feeling
the
crisis
more
seriously
than
they
liked
to
express
loveday
thought
how
ridiculous
a
thing
social
ambition
was
in
such
a
conjuncture
as
this
and
vowed
that
she
would
leave
anne
to
love
where
she
would
anne
too
forgot
the
little
peculiarities
of
speech
and
manner
in
bob
and
his
father
which
sometimes
jarred
for
a
moment
upon
her
more
refined
sense
and
was
thankful
for
their
love
and
protection
in
this
looming
trouble
on
going
upstairs
she
remembered
the
paper
which
farmer
derriman
had
given
her
and
searched
in
her
bosom
for
it
she
could
not
find
it
there
must
have
left
it
on
the
table
she
said
to
herself
it
did
not
matter
she
remembered
every
word
she
took
a
pen
and
wrote
a
duplicate
which
she
put
safely
away
but
anne
was
wrong
she
had
after
all
placed
the
paper
where
she
supposed
and
there
it
ought
to
have
been
but
in
escaping
from
festus
when
he
feigned
apoplexy
it
had
fallen
out
upon
the
grass
five
minutes
after
that
event
when
pursuer
and
pursued
were
two
or
three
fields
ahead
the
woman
whom
the
yeoman
had
overtaken
peeped
cautiously
through
the
stile
into
the
corner
of
the
field
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
scramble
and
seeing
the
paper
she
climbed
over
secured
it
loosened
the
wafer
without
tearing
the
sheet
and
read
the
memorandum
within
unable
to
make
anything
of
its
meaning
the
saunterer
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
dismissing
the
matter
from
her
mind
went
on
by
the
path
which
led
to
the
back
of
the
mill
here
behind
the
hedge
she
stood
and
surveyed
the
old
building
for
some
time
after
which
she
meditatively
turned
and
retraced
her
steps
towards
the
royal
place
xxvi
the
alarm
the
night
which
followed
was
historic
and
memorable
loveday
was
awakened
by
the
boom
of
a
distant
gun
she
told
the
miller
and
they
listened
awhile
the
sound
was
not
repeated
but
such
was
the
state
of
their
feelings
that
loveday
went
to
bob
room
and
asked
if
he
had
heard
it
bob
was
wide
awake
looking
out
of
the
window
he
had
heard
the
ominous
sound
and
was
inclined
to
investigate
the
matter
while
the
father
and
son
were
dressing
they
fancied
that
a
glare
seemed
to
be
rising
in
the
sky
in
the
direction
of
the
beacon
hill
not
wishing
to
alarm
anne
and
her
mother
the
miller
assured
them
that
bob
and
himself
were
merely
going
out
of
doors
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
the
report
after
which
they
plunged
into
the
gloom
together
a
few
steps
progress
opened
up
more
of
the
sky
which
as
they
had
thought
was
indeed
irradiated
by
a
lurid
light
but
whether
it
came
from
the
beacon
or
from
a
more
distant
point
they
were
unable
to
clearly
tell
they
pushed
on
rapidly
towards
higher
ground
their
excitement
was
merely
of
a
piece
with
that
of
all
men
at
this
critical
juncture
everywhere
expectation
was
at
fever
heat
for
the
last
year
or
two
only
miles
of
shallow
water
had
divided
quiet
english
homesteads
from
an
enemy
army
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
we
had
taken
the
matter
lightly
enough
eating
and
drinking
as
in
the
days
of
noe
and
singing
satires
without
end
we
punned
on
buonaparte
and
his
gunboats
chalked
his
effigy
on
and
published
the
same
in
prints
still
between
these
bursts
of
hilarity
it
was
sometimes
recollected
that
england
was
the
only
european
country
which
had
not
succumbed
to
the
mighty
little
man
who
was
less
than
human
in
feeling
and
more
than
human
in
will
that
our
spirit
for
resistance
was
greater
than
our
strength
and
that
the
channel
was
often
calm
boats
built
of
wood
which
was
greenly
growing
in
its
native
forest
three
days
before
it
was
bent
as
wales
to
their
sides
were
ridiculous
enough
but
they
might
be
after
all
sufficient
for
a
single
trip
between
two
visible
shores
the
english
watched
buonaparte
in
these
preparations
and
buonaparte
watched
the
english
at
the
distance
of
boulogne
details
were
lost
but
we
were
impressed
on
fine
days
by
the
novel
sight
of
a
huge
army
moving
and
twinkling
like
a
school
of
mackerel
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
regular
way
of
passing
an
afternoon
in
the
coast
towns
was
to
stroll
up
to
the
signal
posts
and
chat
with
the
lieutenant
on
duty
there
about
the
latest
inimical
object
seen
at
sea
about
once
a
week
there
appeared
in
the
newspapers
either
a
paragraph
concerning
some
adventurous
english
gentleman
who
had
sailed
out
in
a
till
he
lay
near
enough
to
boulogne
to
see
buonaparte
standing
on
the
heights
among
his
marshals
or
else
some
lines
about
a
mysterious
stranger
with
a
foreign
accent
who
after
collecting
a
vast
deal
of
information
on
our
resources
had
hired
a
boat
at
a
southern
port
and
vanished
with
it
towards
france
before
his
intention
could
be
divined
in
forecasting
his
grand
venture
buonaparte
postulated
the
help
of
providence
to
a
remarkable
degree
just
at
the
hour
when
his
troops
were
on
board
the
boats
and
ready
to
sail
there
was
to
be
a
great
fog
that
should
spread
a
vast
obscurity
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
channel
and
keep
the
english
blind
to
events
on
the
other
side
the
fog
was
to
last
hours
after
which
it
might
clear
away
a
dead
calm
was
to
prevail
simultaneously
with
the
fog
with
the
twofold
object
of
affording
the
boats
easy
transit
and
dooming
our
ships
to
lie
motionless
thirdly
there
was
to
be
a
spring
tide
which
should
combine
its
manoeuvres
with
those
of
the
fog
and
calm
among
the
many
thousands
of
minor
englishmen
whose
lives
were
affected
by
these
tremendous
designs
may
be
numbered
our
old
acquaintance
corporal
tullidge
who
sported
the
crushed
arm
and
poor
old
simon
burden
the
dazed
veteran
who
had
fought
at
minden
instead
of
sitting
snugly
in
the
settle
of
the
old
ship
in
the
village
adjoining
overcombe
they
were
obliged
to
keep
watch
on
the
hill
they
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
was
possible
in
the
circumstances
dwelling
in
a
hut
of
clods
and
turf
with
a
brick
chimney
for
cooking
here
they
observed
the
nightly
progress
of
the
moon
and
stars
grew
familiar
with
the
heaving
of
moles
the
dancing
of
rabbits
on
the
hillocks
the
distant
hoot
of
owls
the
bark
of
foxes
from
woods
further
inland
but
saw
not
a
sign
of
the
enemy
as
night
after
night
they
walked
round
the
two
ricks
which
it
was
their
duty
to
fire
at
a
signal
one
being
of
furze
for
a
quick
flame
the
other
of
turf
for
a
long
slow
radiance
they
thought
and
talked
of
old
times
and
drank
patriotically
from
a
large
wood
flagon
that
was
filled
every
day
bob
and
his
father
soon
became
aware
that
the
light
was
from
the
beacon
by
the
time
that
they
reached
the
top
it
was
one
mass
of
towering
flame
from
which
the
sparks
fell
on
the
green
herbage
like
a
fiery
dew
the
forms
of
the
two
old
men
being
seen
passing
and
repassing
in
the
midst
of
it
the
lovedays
who
came
up
on
the
smoky
side
regarded
the
scene
for
a
moment
and
then
emerged
into
the
light
goes
there
said
corporal
tullidge
shouldering
a
pike
with
his
sound
arm
is
neighbour
loveday
you
get
your
signal
to
fire
it
from
the
east
said
the
miller
hastily
from
abbotsea
beach
you
are
not
to
go
by
a
coast
signal
it
all
was
the
direction
whenever
you
see
rainbarrow
beacon
burn
to
the
or
haggardon
to
the
or
the
actual
presence
of
the
enemy
on
the
shore
is
he
here
doubt
the
beach
light
is
only
just
gone
down
and
simon
heard
the
guns
even
better
than
i
hark
i
hear
said
bob
they
listened
with
parted
lips
the
night
wind
blowing
through
simon
burden
few
teeth
as
through
the
ruins
of
stonehenge
from
far
down
on
the
lower
levels
came
the
noise
of
wheels
and
the
tramp
of
horses
upon
the
turnpike
road
there
must
be
something
in
it
said
miller
loveday
gravely
we
go
home
and
make
the
safe
and
then
i
don
my
soldier
clothes
and
be
off
god
knows
where
our
company
will
assemble
they
hastened
down
the
hill
and
on
getting
into
the
road
waited
and
listened
again
travellers
began
to
come
up
and
pass
them
in
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
it
was
difficult
to
attract
their
attention
in
the
dim
light
but
by
standing
on
the
top
of
a
wall
which
fenced
the
road
bob
was
at
last
seen
the
matter
he
cried
to
a
butcher
who
was
flying
past
in
his
cart
his
wife
sitting
behind
him
without
a
bonnet
french
have
landed
said
the
man
without
drawing
rein
shouted
bob
west
bay
and
all
budmouth
is
in
uproar
replied
the
voice
now
faint
in
the
distance
bob
and
his
father
hastened
on
till
they
reached
their
own
house
as
they
had
expected
anne
and
her
mother
in
common
with
most
of
the
people
were
both
dressed
and
stood
at
the
door
bonneted
and
shawled
listening
to
the
traffic
on
the
neighbouring
highway
loveday
having
secured
what
money
and
small
valuables
they
possessed
in
a
huge
pocket
which
extended
all
round
her
waist
and
added
considerably
to
her
weight
and
diameter
true
enough
said
the
miller
come
you
and
anne
and
the
maid
must
be
off
to
cousin
jim
at
and
when
you
get
there
you
must
do
as
they
do
i
must
assemble
with
the
company
i
said
bob
better
run
to
the
church
and
take
a
pike
before
they
be
all
gone
the
horse
was
put
into
the
gig
and
loveday
anne
and
the
maid
were
hastily
packed
into
the
vehicle
the
latter
taking
the
reins
david
duties
as
a
forbidding
all
thought
of
his
domestic
offices
now
then
the
silver
tankard
teapot
pair
of
candlesticks
like
ionic
columns
and
other
articles
too
large
to
be
pocketed
were
thrown
into
a
basket
and
put
up
behind
then
came
the
which
was
as
sad
as
it
was
hurried
bob
kissed
anne
and
there
was
no
affectation
in
her
receiving
that
mark
of
affection
as
she
said
through
her
tears
bless
you
at
last
they
moved
off
in
the
dim
light
of
dawn
neither
of
the
three
women
knowing
which
road
they
were
to
take
but
trusting
to
chance
to
find
it
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
bob
went
off
for
a
pike
and
his
father
first
his
firelock
proceeded
to
don
his
uniform
his
breeches
with
such
cursory
haste
as
to
bespatter
his
black
gaiters
with
the
same
ornamental
compound
finding
when
he
was
ready
that
no
bugle
had
as
yet
sounded
he
went
with
david
to
the
house
dragged
out
the
waggon
and
put
therein
some
of
the
most
useful
and
goods
in
case
there
might
be
an
opportunity
for
conveying
them
away
by
the
time
this
was
done
and
the
waggon
pushed
back
and
locked
in
bob
had
returned
with
his
weapon
somewhat
mortified
at
being
doomed
to
this
low
form
of
defence
the
miller
gave
his
son
a
parting
grasp
of
the
hand
and
arranged
to
meet
him
at
at
the
first
opportunity
if
the
news
were
true
if
happily
false
here
at
their
own
house
it
all
he
exclaimed
looking
at
his
stock
of
flints
said
bob
got
no
ammunition
not
a
blessed
round
what
the
use
of
going
asked
his
son
the
miller
paused
i
go
he
said
somebody
will
lend
me
a
little
if
i
get
into
a
hot
corner
ye
a
little
father
you
was
always
so
simple
said
bob
reproachfully
i
can
bagnet
a
few
anyhow
said
the
miller
the
bugle
had
been
blown
ere
this
and
loveday
the
father
disappeared
towards
the
place
of
assembly
his
empty
behind
him
bob
seized
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
which
he
had
brought
home
from
the
ship
and
armed
with
these
and
a
pike
he
locked
the
door
and
sallied
out
again
towards
the
turnpike
road
by
this
time
the
yeomanry
of
the
district
were
also
on
the
move
and
among
them
festus
derriman
who
was
sleeping
at
his
uncle
and
had
been
awakened
by
cripplestraw
about
the
time
when
bob
and
his
father
were
descending
from
the
beacon
the
stalwart
yeoman
was
standing
in
the
yard
adjusting
his
straps
while
cripplestraw
saddled
the
horse
festus
clanked
up
and
down
looked
gloomily
at
the
beacon
heard
the
retreating
carts
and
carriages
and
called
cripplestraw
to
him
who
came
from
the
stable
leading
the
horse
at
the
same
moment
that
uncle
benjy
peeped
unobserved
from
a
mullioned
window
above
their
heads
the
distant
light
of
the
beacon
fire
touching
up
his
features
to
the
complexion
of
an
old
brass
think
that
before
i
start
cripplestraw
said
festus
whose
lurid
visage
was
undergoing
a
bleaching
process
curious
to
look
upon
shall
go
on
to
budmouth
and
make
a
bold
inquiry
whether
the
cowardly
enemy
is
on
shore
as
yet
or
only
looming
in
the
bay
go
in
a
moment
sir
said
the
other
i
had
my
bad
leg
again
i
should
have
joined
my
company
afore
this
but
they
said
at
last
drill
that
i
was
too
old
so
i
shall
wait
up
in
the
for
tidings
as
soon
as
i
have
packed
you
off
poor
gentleman
such
alarms
as
these
cripplestraw
ever
happen
without
foundation
buonaparte
is
a
wretch
a
miserable
wretch
and
this
may
be
only
a
false
alarm
to
disappoint
such
as
me
no
sir
o
no
sometimes
there
are
false
alarms
sir
yes
there
was
a
pretended
sally
o
gunboats
last
year
was
there
nothing
else
pretended
something
more
like
this
for
instance
cripplestraw
shook
his
head
notice
yer
modesty
festus
in
making
light
of
things
but
there
never
was
sir
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
come
thank
god
my
duty
as
a
local
do
require
me
to
go
to
the
front
but
only
the
valiant
men
like
my
master
ah
if
boney
could
only
see
now
sir
he
know
too
well
there
is
nothing
to
be
got
from
such
a
determined
skilful
officer
but
blows
and
yes
cripplestraw
if
i
ride
off
to
budmouth
and
meet
all
my
training
will
be
lost
no
skill
is
required
as
a
forlorn
hope
that
a
point
sir
you
would
outshine
all
and
be
picked
off
at
the
very
beginning
as
a
brave
man
if
i
stay
here
and
urge
on
the
ones
or
get
up
into
the
by
that
gateway
and
pop
at
the
invaders
through
the
loophole
i
should
be
so
completely
wasted
should
i
would
not
derriman
but
as
you
was
going
to
say
next
the
fire
in
yer
veins
wo
let
ye
do
that
you
are
valiant
very
good
you
do
want
to
husband
yer
valiance
at
home
the
is
plain
my
birth
had
been
more
obscure
murmured
the
yeoman
i
had
only
been
in
the
militia
for
instance
or
among
the
humble
pikemen
so
much
would
have
been
expected
of
me
of
my
fiery
nature
cripplestraw
is
there
a
drop
of
brandy
to
be
got
at
in
the
house
i
do
feel
very
well
nephew
said
the
old
gentleman
from
above
whom
neither
of
the
others
had
as
yet
noticed
have
any
spirits
opened
so
unfortunate
but
there
a
beautiful
barrel
of
cider
in
draught
and
there
some
cold
tea
from
last
night
is
he
listening
said
festus
staring
up
i
warrant
how
glad
he
is
to
see
me
forced
to
go
called
out
of
bed
without
breakfast
and
he
quite
safe
and
sure
to
escape
because
he
an
old
man
cripplestraw
i
like
being
in
the
yeomanry
cavalry
but
i
wish
i
had
been
in
the
ranks
i
wish
i
had
been
only
the
surgeon
to
stay
in
the
rear
while
the
bodies
are
brought
back
to
him
i
mean
i
should
have
thrown
my
heart
at
such
a
time
as
this
more
into
the
labour
of
restoring
wounded
men
and
joining
their
shattered
limbs
together
more
than
i
can
into
causing
the
wounds
i
am
too
humane
cripplestraw
for
the
ranks
yes
said
his
companion
depressing
his
spirits
to
a
kindred
level
yet
such
is
fate
that
instead
of
joining
men
limbs
together
you
have
to
get
your
own
joined
poor
young
sojer
all
through
having
such
a
warlike
soul
murmured
festus
and
paused
ca
think
how
strange
i
feel
here
cripplestraw
he
continued
laying
his
hand
upon
the
centre
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
i
do
wish
i
was
only
the
surgeon
he
slowly
mounted
and
uncle
benjy
in
the
meantime
sang
to
himself
as
he
looked
on
and
half
from
and
from
that
old
mummy
singing
said
festus
savagely
a
hymn
for
preservation
from
our
enemies
dear
nephew
meekly
replied
the
farmer
who
had
heard
the
remark
and
half
from
festus
allowed
his
horse
to
move
on
a
few
paces
and
then
turned
again
as
if
struck
by
a
happy
invention
he
began
with
an
artificial
laugh
am
obliged
to
confess
after
all
i
must
see
her
is
nature
that
makes
me
draw
back
is
love
i
must
go
and
look
for
her
woman
sir
did
want
to
confess
it
but
is
a
woman
strange
that
i
should
be
drawn
so
entirely
against
my
natural
wish
to
rush
at
cripplestraw
seeing
which
way
the
wind
blew
found
it
advisable
to
blow
in
harmony
now
at
last
i
see
sir
spite
that
few
men
live
that
be
worthy
to
command
ye
spite
that
you
could
rush
on
marshal
the
troops
to
victory
as
i
may
say
but
then
what
of
it
there
the
unhappy
fate
of
being
smit
with
the
eyes
of
a
woman
and
you
are
unmanned
maister
derriman
who
is
himself
when
he
got
a
woman
round
his
neck
like
a
millstone
is
something
like
that
feel
the
case
be
you
valiant
i
know
of
course
the
words
being
a
matter
of
form
be
you
valiant
i
ask
yes
of
course
then
do
you
waste
it
in
the
open
field
hoard
it
up
i
say
sir
for
a
higher
class
of
war
the
defence
of
yer
adorable
lady
think
what
you
owe
her
at
this
terrible
time
now
maister
derriman
once
more
i
ask
ye
to
cast
off
that
first
haughty
wish
to
rush
to
budmouth
and
to
go
where
your
is
defenceless
and
alone
will
cripplestraw
now
you
put
it
like
that
ye
thank
ye
heartily
maister
derriman
go
now
and
hide
with
her
can
i
now
hang
flattery
can
a
man
hide
without
a
stain
of
course
i
would
not
hide
in
any
mean
sense
no
not
i
you
be
in
love
is
plain
you
may
since
it
is
not
your
own
life
but
another
that
you
are
concerned
for
and
you
only
save
your
own
because
it
ca
be
helped
true
cripplestraw
in
a
sense
but
will
it
be
understood
that
way
will
they
see
it
as
a
brave
hiding
sir
if
you
had
not
been
in
love
i
own
to
ye
that
hiding
would
look
queer
but
being
to
save
the
tears
groans
fits
swowndings
and
perhaps
death
of
a
comely
young
woman
yer
principle
is
good
you
honourably
retreat
because
you
be
too
gallant
to
advance
this
sounds
strange
ye
may
say
sir
but
it
is
plain
enough
to
less
fiery
minds
festus
did
for
a
moment
try
to
uncover
his
teeth
in
a
natural
smile
but
it
died
away
you
flatter
me
or
do
you
mean
it
well
there
truth
in
it
i
am
more
gallant
in
going
to
her
than
in
marching
to
the
shore
but
we
can
not
be
too
careful
about
our
good
names
we
soldiers
i
must
not
be
seen
i
off
cripplestraw
opened
the
hurdle
which
closed
the
arch
under
the
portico
gateway
and
festus
passed
under
uncle
benjamin
singing
and
a
half
from
with
a
sort
of
sublime
ecstasy
feeling
as
festus
had
observed
that
his
money
was
safe
and
that
the
french
would
not
personally
molest
an
old
man
in
such
a
ragged
mildewed
coat
as
that
he
wore
which
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
borrow
from
a
scarecrow
in
one
of
his
fields
for
the
purpose
festus
rode
on
full
of
his
intention
to
seek
out
anne
and
under
cover
of
protecting
her
retreat
accompany
her
to
where
he
knew
the
lovedays
had
relatives
in
the
lane
he
met
granny
seamore
who
having
packed
up
all
her
possessions
in
a
small
basket
was
placidly
retreating
to
the
mountains
till
all
should
be
over
granny
have
ye
seen
the
french
asked
festus
she
said
looking
up
at
him
through
her
brazen
spectacles
i
had
i
should
ha
seed
thee
replied
the
yeoman
and
rode
on
just
as
he
reached
the
old
road
which
he
had
intended
merely
to
cross
and
avoid
his
countenance
fell
some
troops
of
regulars
who
appeared
to
be
dragoons
were
rattling
along
the
road
festus
hastened
towards
an
opposite
gate
so
as
to
get
within
the
field
before
they
should
see
him
but
as
would
have
it
as
soon
as
he
got
inside
a
party
of
six
or
seven
of
his
own
yeomanry
troop
were
straggling
across
the
same
field
and
making
for
the
spot
where
he
was
the
dragoons
passed
without
seeing
him
but
when
he
turned
out
into
the
road
again
it
was
impossible
to
retreat
towards
overcombe
village
because
of
the
yeomen
so
he
rode
straight
on
and
heard
them
coming
at
his
heels
there
was
no
other
gate
and
the
highway
soon
became
as
straight
as
a
bowstring
unable
thus
to
turn
without
meeting
them
and
caught
like
an
eel
in
a
festus
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
fateful
shore
but
he
did
not
relinquish
hope
just
ahead
there
were
and
he
might
have
a
chance
of
slipping
down
one
of
them
without
being
seen
on
reaching
the
spot
he
found
that
he
was
not
alone
a
horseman
had
come
up
the
lane
and
drawn
rein
it
was
an
officer
of
the
german
legion
and
seeing
festus
he
held
up
his
hand
festus
rode
up
to
him
and
saluted
ist
false
report
said
the
officer
festus
was
a
man
again
he
felt
that
nothing
was
too
much
for
him
the
officer
after
some
explanation
of
the
cause
of
alarm
said
that
he
was
going
across
to
the
road
which
led
by
the
moor
to
stop
the
troops
and
volunteers
converging
from
that
direction
upon
which
festus
offered
to
give
information
along
the
casterbridge
road
the
german
crossed
over
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
in
the
lane
while
festus
turned
back
upon
the
way
by
which
he
had
come
the
party
of
yeomanry
cavalry
was
rapidly
drawing
near
and
he
soon
recognized
among
them
the
excited
voices
of
stubb
of
duddle
hole
noakes
of
muckleford
and
other
comrades
of
his
orgies
at
the
hall
it
was
a
magnificent
opportunity
and
festus
drew
his
sword
when
they
were
within
speaking
distance
he
reined
round
his
charger
head
to
budmouth
and
shouted
comrades
on
i
am
waiting
for
you
you
have
been
a
long
time
getting
up
with
me
seeing
the
glorious
nature
of
our
deeds
said
derriman
well
said
replied
the
foremost
of
the
riders
you
heard
anything
new
that
he
here
with
his
tens
of
thousands
and
that
we
are
to
ride
to
meet
him
sword
in
hand
as
soon
as
we
have
assembled
in
the
town
ahead
here
lord
said
noakes
with
a
slight
falling
of
the
lower
jaw
man
who
quails
now
is
unworthy
of
the
name
of
yeoman
said
festus
still
keeping
ahead
of
the
other
troopers
and
holding
up
his
sword
to
the
sun
noakes
fie
fie
you
begin
to
look
pale
man
perhaps
you
look
pale
said
noakes
with
an
envious
glance
upon
festus
daring
manner
you
had
a
wife
and
family
depending
upon
ye
take
three
frenchmen
rejoined
derriman
still
flourishing
his
sword
have
as
good
swords
as
you
as
you
will
soon
find
said
another
of
the
yeomen
they
were
three
times
armed
said
festus
thrice
three
times
i
would
attempt
three
to
one
how
do
you
feel
now
my
old
friend
stubb
turning
to
another
of
the
warriors

no
bouncing
health
to
our
in
oxwell
hall
this
summer
as
last
eh
brownjohn
am
afraid

said
brownjohn
gloomily
rattling
dinners
at
stacie
hotel
and
the
king
below
with
his
staff
no
wrenching
off
and
sending
to
the
bakehouse
in
a
pie
that
nobody
calls
for
weeks
of
work
rather
suppose
so
how
we
may
we
sha
get
rid
of
the
cursed
tyrant
before
autumn
and
many
thousand
brave
men
will
lie
low
before
it
done
remarked
a
young
yeoman
with
a
calm
face
who
meant
to
do
his
duty
without
much
talking
grinning
matches
at
castle
this
summer
festus
resumed
at
greenhill
fair
and
going
into
shows
and
driving
the
showman

with

not
it
make
you
seem
just
a
trifle
uncomfortable
noakes
keep
up
your
spirits
old
comrade
come
forward
we
are
only
ambling
on
like
so
many
we
have
to
get
into
budmouth
join
the
rest
of
the
troop
and
then
march
along
the
coast
as
i
imagine
at
this
rate
we
sha
be
well
into
the
thick
of
battle
before
twelve
spur
on
comrades
no
dancing
on
the
green
lockham
this
year
in
the
moonlight
you
was
tender
upon
that
girl
gad
what
will
become
o
her
in
the
struggle
come
derriman
expostulated
lockham
is
all
very
well
but
i
do
care
for
i
am
as
ready
to
fight
as
any
man
but
when
you
get
into
battle
derriman
and
see
what
it
like
your
courage
will
cool
down
a
little
added
noakes
on
the
same
side
but
with
secret
admiration
of
festus
reckless
bravery
shall
be
bayoneted
first
said
festus
let
rally
and
on
since
festus
was
determined
to
spur
on
wildly
the
rest
of
the
yeomen
did
not
like
to
seem
behindhand
and
they
rapidly
approached
the
town
had
they
been
calm
enough
to
reflect
they
might
have
observed
that
for
the
last
no
carts
or
carriages
had
met
them
on
the
way
as
they
had
done
further
back
it
was
not
till
the
troopers
reached
the
turnpike
that
they
learnt
what
festus
had
known
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
at
the
intelligence
derriman
sheathed
his
sword
with
a
sigh
and
the
party
soon
fell
in
with
comrades
who
had
arrived
there
before
them
whereupon
the
source
and
details
of
the
alarm
were
boisterously
discussed
did
you
know
of
the
mistake
till
now
asked
one
of
these
of
the
when
i
was
dropping
over
the
hill
by
the
roads
i
looked
back
and
saw
that
man
talking
to
the
messenger
and
he
must
have
told
him
the
truth
the
speaker
pointed
to
festus
they
turned
their
indignant
eyes
full
upon
him
that
he
had
sported
with
their
deepest
feelings
while
knowing
the
rumour
to
be
baseless
was
soon
apparent
to
all
him
black
and
blue
with
the
flat
of
our
blades
shouted
two
or
three
turning
their
horses
heads
to
drop
back
upon
derriman
in
which
move
they
were
followed
by
most
of
the
party
but
festus
foreseeing
danger
from
the
unexpected
revelation
had
already
judiciously
placed
a
few
intervening
yards
between
himself
and
his
yeomen
and
now
clapping
spurs
to
his
horse
rattled
like
thunder
and
lightning
up
the
road
homeward
his
ready
flight
added
hotness
to
their
pursuit
and
as
he
rode
and
looked
fearfully
over
his
shoulder
he
could
see
them
following
with
enraged
faces
and
drawn
swords
a
position
which
they
kept
up
for
a
distance
of
more
than
a
mile
then
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
drop
off
one
by
one
and
soon
he
and
his
panting
charger
remained
alone
on
the
highway
xxvii
danger
to
anne
he
stopped
and
reflected
how
to
turn
this
rebuff
to
advantage
baulked
in
his
project
of
entering
the
and
enjoying
congratulations
upon
his
patriotic
bearing
during
the
advance
he
sulkily
considered
that
he
might
be
able
to
make
some
use
of
his
enforced
retirement
by
riding
to
overcombe
and
glorifying
himself
in
the
eyes
of
miss
garland
before
the
truth
should
have
reached
that
hamlet
having
thus
decided
he
spurred
on
in
a
better
mood
by
this
time
the
volunteers
were
on
the
march
and
as
derriman
ascended
the
road
he
met
the
overcombe
company
in
which
trudged
miller
loveday
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
other
substantial
householders
of
the
place
and
its
neighbourhood
duly
equipped
with
pouches
firelocks
pickers
worms
magazines
ball
and
pomatum
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
further
suppression
of
the
truth
and
briefly
informing
them
that
the
danger
was
not
so
immediate
as
had
been
supposed
festus
galloped
on
at
the
end
of
another
mile
he
met
a
large
number
of
pikemen
including
bob
loveday
whom
the
yeoman
resolved
to
sound
upon
the
whereabouts
of
anne
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
lead
bob
to
speak
more
frankly
than
he
might
have
done
on
reflection
and
he
told
festus
the
direction
in
which
the
women
had
been
sent
then
festus
informed
the
group
that
the
report
of
invasion
was
false
upon
which
they
all
turned
to
go
homeward
with
greatly
relieved
spirits
bob
walked
beside
derriman
horse
for
some
distance
loveday
had
instantly
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
look
for
the
women
and
ease
their
anxiety
by
letting
them
know
the
good
news
as
soon
as
possible
but
he
said
nothing
of
this
to
festus
during
their
return
together
nor
did
festus
tell
bob
that
he
also
had
resolved
to
seek
them
out
and
by
anticipating
every
one
else
in
that
enterprise
make
of
it
a
glorious
opportunity
for
bringing
miss
garland
to
her
senses
about
him
he
still
resented
the
ducking
that
he
had
received
at
her
hands
and
was
not
disposed
to
let
that
insult
pass
without
obtaining
some
sort
of
sweet
revenge
as
soon
as
they
had
parted
festus
cantered
on
over
the
hill
meeting
on
his
way
the
longpuddle
volunteers
sixty
rank
and
file
under
captain
cunningham
the
casterbridge
company
ninety
strong
known
as
the
company
in
those
days
under
captain
strickland
and
others
all
with
anxious
faces
and
covered
with
dust
just
passing
the
word
to
them
and
leaving
them
at
halt
he
proceeded
rapidly
onward
in
the
direction
of
nobody
appeared
on
the
road
for
some
time
till
after
a
ride
of
several
miles
he
met
a
stray
corporal
of
volunteers
who
told
festus
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
that
he
had
certainly
passed
no
gig
full
of
women
of
the
kind
described
believing
that
he
had
missed
them
by
following
the
highway
derriman
turned
back
into
a
lane
along
which
they
might
have
chosen
to
journey
for
privacy
sake
notwithstanding
the
badness
and
uncertainty
of
its
track
arriving
again
within
five
miles
of
overcombe
he
at
length
heard
tidings
of
the
wandering
vehicle
and
its
precious
burden
which
like
the
ark
when
sent
away
from
the
country
of
the
philistines
had
apparently
been
left
to
the
instincts
of
the
beast
that
drew
it
a
labouring
man
just
at
daybreak
had
seen
the
helpless
party
going
slowly
up
a
distant
drive
which
he
pointed
out
no
sooner
had
festus
parted
from
this
informant
than
he
beheld
bob
approaching
mounted
on
the
miller
second
and
heavier
horse
bob
looked
rather
surprised
and
festus
felt
his
coming
glory
in
danger
went
down
that
lane
he
said
signifying
precisely
the
opposite
direction
to
the
true
one
too
have
been
on
the
for
missing
friends
as
festus
was
riding
back
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
his
information
and
loveday
rode
on
as
misdirected
immediately
that
he
was
out
of
sight
festus
reversed
his
course
and
followed
the
track
which
anne
and
her
companions
were
last
seen
to
pursue
this
road
had
been
ascended
by
the
gig
in
question
nearly
two
hours
before
the
present
moment
molly
the
servant
held
the
reins
loveday
sat
beside
her
and
anne
behind
their
progress
was
but
slow
owing
partly
to
molly
want
of
skill
and
partly
to
the
steepness
of
the
road
which
here
passed
over
downs
of
some
extent
and
was
rarely
or
never
mended
it
was
an
anxious
morning
for
them
all
and
the
beauties
of
the
early
summer
day
fell
upon
unheeding
eyes
they
were
too
anxious
even
for
conjecture
and
each
sat
thinking
her
own
thoughts
occasionally
glancing
westward
or
stopping
the
horse
to
listen
to
sounds
from
more
frequented
roads
along
which
other
parties
were
retreating
once
while
they
listened
and
gazed
thus
they
saw
a
glittering
in
the
distance
and
heard
the
tramp
of
many
horses
it
was
a
large
body
of
cavalry
going
in
the
direction
of
the
king
the
same
regiment
of
dragoons
in
fact
which
festus
had
seen
further
on
in
its
course
the
women
in
the
gig
had
no
doubt
that
these
men
were
marching
at
once
to
engage
the
enemy
by
way
of
varying
the
monotony
of
the
journey
molly
occasionally
burst
into
tears
of
horror
believing
buonaparte
to
be
in
countenance
and
habits
precisely
what
the
caricatures
represented
him
loveday
endeavoured
to
establish
cheerfulness
by
assuring
her
companions
of
the
natural
civility
of
the
french
nation
with
whom
unprotected
women
were
safe
from
injury
unless
through
the
casual
excesses
of
soldiery
beyond
control
this
was
poor
consolation
to
anne
whose
mind
was
more
occupied
with
bob
than
with
herself
and
a
miserable
fear
that
she
would
never
again
see
him
alive
so
paled
her
face
and
saddened
her
gaze
forward
that
at
last
her
mother
said
was
you
thinking
of
my
dear
anne
only
reply
was
a
look
at
her
mother
with
which
a
tear
mingled
molly
whipped
the
horse
by
which
she
quickened
his
pace
for
five
yards
when
he
again
fell
into
the
perverse
slowness
that
showed
how
fully
conscious
he
was
of
being
the
and
chief
personage
of
the
four
whenever
there
was
a
pool
of
water
by
the
road
he
turned
aside
to
drink
a
mouthful
and
remained
there
his
own
time
in
spite
of
molly
tug
at
the
reins
and
futile
on
his
rump
they
were
now
in
the
chalk
district
where
there
were
no
hedges
and
a
rough
attempt
at
mending
the
way
had
been
made
by
throwing
down
huge
lumps
of
that
glaring
material
in
heaps
without
troubling
to
spread
it
or
break
them
abroad
the
jolting
here
was
most
distressing
and
seemed
about
to
snap
the
springs
that
wheel
do
wamble
said
molly
at
last
she
had
scarcely
spoken
when
the
wheel
came
off
and
all
three
were
precipitated
over
it
into
the
road
fortunately
the
horse
stood
still
and
they
began
to
gather
themselves
up
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
had
suffered
in
the
least
from
the
fall
was
anne
and
she
was
only
conscious
of
a
severe
shaking
which
had
half
stupefied
her
for
the
time
the
wheel
lay
flat
in
the
road
so
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
driving
further
in
their
present
plight
they
looked
around
for
help
the
only
friendly
object
near
was
a
lonely
cottage
from
its
situation
evidently
the
home
of
a
shepherd
the
horse
was
unharnessed
and
tied
to
the
back
of
the
gig
and
the
three
women
went
across
to
the
house
on
getting
close
they
found
that
the
shutters
of
all
the
lower
windows
were
closed
but
on
trying
the
door
it
opened
to
the
hand
nobody
was
within
the
house
appeared
to
have
been
abandoned
in
some
confusion
and
the
probability
was
that
the
shepherd
had
fled
on
hearing
the
alarm
anne
now
said
that
she
felt
the
effects
of
her
fall
too
severely
to
be
able
to
go
any
further
just
then
and
it
was
agreed
that
she
should
be
left
there
while
loveday
and
molly
went
on
for
assistance
the
elder
lady
deeming
molly
too
young
and
minded
to
be
trusted
to
go
alone
molly
suggested
taking
the
horse
as
the
distance
might
be
great
each
of
them
sitting
alternately
on
his
back
while
the
other
led
him
by
the
head
this
they
did
anne
watching
them
vanish
down
the
white
and
lumpy
road
she
then
looked
round
the
room
as
well
as
she
could
do
so
by
the
light
from
the
open
door
it
was
plain
from
the
shutters
being
closed
that
the
shepherd
had
left
his
house
before
daylight
the
candle
and
extinguisher
on
the
table
pointing
to
the
same
conclusion
here
she
remained
her
eyes
occasionally
sweeping
the
bare
sunny
expanse
of
down
that
was
only
relieved
from
absolute
emptiness
by
the
overturned
gig
hard
by
the
sheep
seemed
to
have
gone
away
and
scarcely
a
bird
flew
across
to
disturb
the
solitude
anne
had
risen
early
that
morning
and
leaning
back
in
the
withy
chair
which
she
had
placed
by
the
door
she
soon
fell
into
an
uneasy
doze
from
which
she
was
awakened
by
the
distant
tramp
of
a
horse
feeling
much
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
overturn
she
eagerly
rose
and
looked
out
the
horse
was
not
miller
loveday
but
a
powerful
bay
bearing
a
man
in
full
yeomanry
uniform
anne
did
not
wait
to
recognize
further
instantly
the
house
she
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
in
the
dark
she
sat
and
listened
not
a
sound
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
thinking
that
the
rider
if
he
were
not
festus
had
carelessly
passed
by
or
that
if
he
were
festus
he
had
not
seen
her
she
crept
softly
upstairs
and
peeped
out
of
the
window
excepting
the
spot
of
shade
formed
by
the
gig
as
before
the
down
was
quite
bare
she
then
opened
the
casement
and
stretched
out
her
neck
young
madam
there
you
are
i
knew
now
you
are
caught
came
like
a
clap
of
thunder
from
a
point
three
or
four
feet
beneath
her
and
turning
down
her
frightened
eyes
she
beheld
festus
derriman
lurking
close
to
the
wall
his
attention
had
first
been
attracted
by
her
shutting
the
door
of
the
cottage
then
by
the
overturned
gig
and
after
making
sure
by
examining
the
vehicle
that
he
was
not
mistaken
in
her
identity
he
had
dismounted
led
his
horse
round
to
the
side
and
crept
up
to
entrap
her
anne
started
back
into
the
room
and
remained
still
as
a
stone
festus
went
on
you
must
trust
to
me
the
french
have
landed
i
have
been
trying
to
meet
with
you
every
hour
since
that
confounded
trick
you
played
me
you
threw
me
into
the
water
faith
it
was
well
for
you
i
did
catch
ye
then
i
should
have
taken
a
revenge
in
a
better
way
than
i
shall
now
i
mean
to
have
that
kiss
of
ye
come
miss
nancy
do
you
hear
is
no
use
for
you
to
lurk
inside
there
you
have
to
turn
out
as
soon
as
boney
comes
over
the
hill
are
you
going
to
open
the
door
i
say
and
speak
to
me
in
a
civil
way
what
do
you
think
i
am
then
that
you
should
barricade
yourself
against
me
as
if
i
was
a
wild
beast
or
frenchman
open
the
door
or
put
out
your
head
or
do
something
or
my
soul
i
break
in
the
door
it
occurred
to
anne
at
this
point
of
the
tirade
that
the
best
policy
would
be
to
temporize
till
somebody
should
return
and
she
put
out
her
head
and
face
now
grown
somewhat
pale
better
said
festus
i
can
talk
to
you
come
my
dear
will
you
open
the
door
why
should
you
be
afraid
of
me
am
not
altogether
afraid
of
you
i
am
safe
from
the
french
here
said
anne
not
very
truthfully
and
anxiously
casting
her
eyes
over
the
vacant
down
let
me
tell
you
that
the
alarm
is
false
and
that
no
landing
has
been
attempted
now
will
you
open
the
door
and
let
me
in
i
am
tired
i
have
been
on
horseback
ever
since
daylight
and
have
come
to
bring
you
the
good
tidings
anne
looked
as
if
she
doubted
the
news
said
festus
i
can
not
let
you
in
she
murmured
after
a
pause
my
wig
then
he
cried
his
face
flaming
up
find
a
way
to
get
in
now
do
you
provoke
me
you
do
know
what
i
am
capable
of
i
ask
you
again
will
you
open
the
door
do
you
wish
it
she
said
faintly
have
told
you
i
want
to
sit
down
and
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
can
ask
me
from
where
you
are
can
not
ask
you
properly
it
is
about
a
serious
matter
whether
you
will
accept
my
heart
and
hand
i
am
not
going
to
throw
myself
at
your
feet
but
i
ask
you
to
do
your
duty
as
a
woman
namely
give
your
solemn
word
to
take
my
name
as
soon
as
the
war
is
over
and
i
have
time
to
attend
to
you
i
scorn
to
ask
it
of
a
haughty
hussy
who
will
only
speak
to
me
through
a
window
however
i
put
it
to
you
for
the
last
time
madam
there
was
no
sign
on
the
down
of
anybody
return
and
she
said
think
of
it
sir
have
thought
of
it
long
enough
i
want
to
know
will
you
or
you
well
i
think
i
will
and
then
she
felt
that
she
might
be
buying
personal
safety
too
dearly
by
shuffling
thus
since
he
would
spread
the
report
that
she
had
accepted
him
and
cause
endless
complication
she
said
have
changed
my
mind
i
can
not
accept
you
mr
derriman
how
you
play
with
me
he
exclaimed
stamping
yes
one
moment
no
the
next
come
you
do
know
what
you
refuse
that
old
hall
is
my
uncle
own
and
he
has
nobody
else
to
leave
it
to
as
soon
as
he
dead
i
shall
throw
up
farming
and
start
as
a
squire
and
now
he
added
with
a
bitter
sneer
a
fool
you
are
to
hang
back
from
such
a
chance
you
i
do
value
it
said
anne
you
hate
him
who
would
make
it
yours
may
not
lie
in
your
power
to
do
that
has
the
old
fellow
been
telling
you
his
affairs
why
do
you
mistrust
me
now
after
this
will
you
open
the
door
and
show
that
you
treat
me
as
a
friend
if
you
wo
accept
me
as
a
lover
i
only
want
to
sit
and
talk
to
you
anne
thought
she
would
trust
him
it
seemed
almost
impossible
that
he
could
harm
her
she
retired
from
the
window
and
went
downstairs
when
her
hand
was
upon
the
bolt
of
the
door
her
mind
misgave
her
instead
of
withdrawing
it
she
remained
in
silence
where
she
was
and
he
began
again
you
going
to
unfasten
it
anne
did
not
speak
dash
my
wig
i
will
get
at
you
you
tried
me
beyond
endurance
one
kiss
would
have
been
enough
that
day
in
the
mead
now
i
have
forty
whether
you
will
or
no
he
flung
himself
against
the
door
but
as
it
was
bolted
and
had
in
addition
a
great
wooden
bar
across
it
this
produced
no
effect
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
the
terrified
girl
heard
him
attempt
the
shuttered
window
she
ran
upstairs
and
again
scanned
the
down
the
yellow
gig
still
lay
in
the
blazing
sunshine
and
the
horse
of
festus
stood
by
the
corner
of
the
garden
nothing
else
was
to
be
seen
at
this
moment
there
came
to
her
ear
the
noise
of
a
sword
drawn
from
its
scabbard
and
peeping
over
the
she
saw
her
tormentor
drive
his
sword
between
the
joints
of
the
shutters
in
an
attempt
to
rip
them
open
the
sword
snapped
off
in
his
hand
with
an
imprecation
he
pulled
out
the
piece
and
returned
the
two
halves
to
the
scabbard
ha
he
cried
catching
sight
of
the
top
of
her
head
only
a
joke
you
know
but
i
get
in
all
the
same
all
for
a
kiss
but
never
mind
we
do
it
yet
he
spoke
in
an
affectedly
light
tone
as
if
ashamed
of
his
previous
resentful
temper
but
she
could
see
by
the
livid
back
of
his
neck
that
he
was
brimful
of
suppressed
passion
a
jest
you
know
he
went
on
are
we
going
to
do
it
now
why
in
this
way
i
go
and
get
a
ladder
and
enter
at
the
upper
window
where
my
love
is
and
there
the
ladder
lying
under
that
in
the
first
enclosed
field
back
in
two
minutes
dear
he
ran
off
and
was
lost
to
her
view
xxviii
anne
does
wonders
anne
fearfully
surveyed
her
position
the
upper
windows
of
the
cottage
were
of
flimsiest
and
to
keep
him
out
would
be
hopeless
she
felt
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
in
getting
away
running
downstairs
she
opened
the
door
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
terrified
understanding
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
escaping
him
by
flight
afoot
across
such
an
extensive
down
since
he
might
mount
his
horse
and
easily
ride
after
her
the
animal
still
remained
tethered
at
the
corner
of
the
garden
if
she
could
release
him
and
frighten
him
away
before
festus
returned
there
would
not
be
quite
such
odds
against
her
she
accordingly
unhooked
the
horse
by
reaching
over
the
bank
and
then
pulling
off
her
muslin
neckerchief
flapped
it
in
his
eyes
to
startle
him
but
the
gallant
steed
did
not
move
or
flinch
she
tried
again
and
he
seemed
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
at
this
moment
she
heard
a
cry
from
the
cottage
and
turning
beheld
her
adversary
approaching
round
the
corner
of
the
building
thought
i
should
tole
out
the
mouse
by
that
trick
cried
festus
exultingly
instead
of
going
for
a
ladder
he
had
simply
hidden
himself
at
the
back
to
tempt
her
down
poor
anne
was
now
desperate
the
bank
on
which
she
stood
was
level
with
the
horse
back
and
the
creature
seemed
quiet
as
a
lamb
with
a
determination
of
which
she
was
capable
in
emergencies
she
seized
the
rein
flung
herself
upon
the
sheepskin
and
held
on
by
the
mane
the
amazed
charger
lifted
his
head
sniffed
wrenched
his
ears
hither
and
thither
and
started
off
at
a
frightful
speed
across
the
down
my
heart
and
limbs
said
festus
under
his
breath
as
thoroughly
alarmed
he
gazed
after
her
on
champion
she
break
her
neck
and
i
shall
be
tried
for
manslaughter
and
disgrace
will
be
brought
upon
the
name
of
derriman
champion
continued
to
go
at
a
but
he
did
nothing
worse
had
he
plunged
or
reared
derriman
fears
might
have
been
verified
and
anne
have
come
with
deadly
force
to
the
ground
but
the
course
was
good
and
in
the
horse
speed
lay
a
comparative
security
she
was
scarcely
shaken
in
her
precarious
position
though
she
was
awed
to
see
the
grass
loose
stones
and
other
objects
pass
her
eyes
like
strokes
whenever
she
opened
them
which
was
only
just
for
a
second
at
intervals
of
half
a
minute
and
to
feel
how
wildly
the
stirrups
swung
and
that
what
struck
her
knee
was
the
bucket
of
the
carbine
and
that
it
was
a
which
hurt
her
arm
they
quickly
cleared
the
down
and
anne
became
conscious
that
the
course
of
the
horse
was
homeward
as
soon
as
the
ground
began
to
rise
towards
the
outer
belt
of
upland
which
lay
between
her
and
the
coast
champion
now
panting
and
reeking
with
moisture
lessened
his
speed
in
sheer
weariness
and
proceeded
at
a
rapid
jolting
trot
anne
felt
that
she
could
not
hold
on
half
so
well
the
gallop
had
been
child
play
compared
with
this
they
were
in
a
lane
ascending
to
a
ridge
and
she
made
up
her
mind
for
a
fall
over
the
ridge
rose
an
animated
spot
higher
and
higher
it
turned
out
to
be
the
upper
part
of
a
man
and
the
man
to
be
a
soldier
such
was
anne
attitude
that
she
only
got
an
occasional
glimpse
of
him
and
though
she
feared
that
he
might
be
a
frenchman
she
feared
the
horse
more
than
the
enemy
as
she
had
feared
festus
more
than
the
horse
anne
had
energy
enough
left
to
cry
him
stop
him
as
the
soldier
drew
near
he
astonished
at
the
sight
of
a
military
horse
with
a
bundle
of
drapery
across
his
back
had
already
placed
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
and
he
now
held
out
his
arms
till
his
figure
assumed
the
form
of
a
latin
cross
planted
in
the
roadway
champion
drew
near
swerved
and
stood
still
almost
suddenly
a
check
sufficient
to
send
anne
slipping
down
his
flank
to
the
ground
the
timely
friend
stepped
forward
and
helped
her
to
her
feet
when
she
saw
that
he
was
john
loveday
you
hurt
he
said
hastily
having
turned
quite
pale
at
seeing
her
fall
no
not
a
bit
said
anne
gathering
herself
up
with
forced
briskness
to
make
light
of
the
misadventure
how
did
you
get
in
such
a
place
he
gone
she
exclaimed
instead
of
replying
as
champion
swept
round
john
loveday
and
cantered
off
triumphantly
in
the
direction
of
oxwell
a
performance
which
she
followed
with
her
eyes
how
did
you
come
upon
his
back
and
whose
horse
is
it
will
tell
you
can
not
tell
you
john
looked
steadily
at
her
saying
nothing
did
you
come
here
she
asked
it
true
that
the
french
have
not
landed
at
all
true
the
alarm
was
groundless
i
tell
you
all
about
it
you
look
very
tired
you
had
better
sit
down
a
few
minutes
let
us
sit
on
this
bank
he
helped
her
to
the
slope
indicated
and
continued
still
as
if
his
thoughts
were
more
occupied
with
the
mystery
of
her
recent
situation
than
with
what
he
was
saying
arrived
at
budmouth
barracks
this
morning
and
are
to
lie
there
all
the
summer
i
could
not
write
to
tell
father
we
were
coming
it
was
not
because
of
any
rumour
of
the
french
for
we
knew
nothing
of
that
till
we
met
the
people
on
the
road
and
the
colonel
said
in
a
moment
the
news
was
false
buonaparte
is
not
even
at
boulogne
just
now
i
was
anxious
to
know
how
you
had
borne
the
fright
so
i
hastened
to
overcombe
at
once
as
soon
as
i
could
get
out
of
barracks
anne
who
had
not
been
at
all
responsive
to
his
discourse
now
swayed
heavily
against
him
and
looking
quickly
down
he
found
that
she
had
silently
fainted
to
support
her
in
his
arms
was
of
course
the
impulse
of
a
moment
there
was
no
water
to
be
had
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
to
hold
her
tenderly
till
she
came
round
again
certainly
he
desired
nothing
more
again
he
asked
himself
what
did
it
all
mean
he
waited
looking
down
upon
her
tired
eyelids
and
at
the
row
of
lashes
lying
upon
each
cheek
whose
natural
roundness
showed
itself
in
singular
perfection
now
that
the
customary
pink
had
given
place
to
a
pale
luminousness
caught
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
the
dumpy
ringlets
about
her
forehead
and
behind
her
poll
which
were
usually
as
tight
as
springs
had
been
partially
uncoiled
by
the
wildness
of
her
ride
and
hung
in
split
locks
over
her
forehead
and
neck
john
who
during
the
long
months
of
his
absence
had
lived
only
to
meet
her
again
was
in
a
state
of
ecstatic
reverence
and
bending
down
he
gently
kissed
her
anne
was
just
becoming
conscious
derriman
never
never
she
murmured
sweeping
her
face
with
her
hand
thought
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
said
john
anne
opened
her
eyes
and
started
back
from
him
is
it
she
said
wildly
are
ill
my
dear
miss
garland
replied
john
in
trembling
anxiety
and
taking
her
hand
am
not
ill
i
am
wearied
out
she
said
we
walk
on
how
far
are
we
from
overcombe
a
mile
but
tell
me
somebody
has
been
hurting
you
frightening
you
i
know
who
it
was
it
was
derriman
and
that
was
his
horse
now
do
you
tell
me
all
anne
reflected
if
i
tell
you
she
said
you
discuss
with
me
what
i
had
better
do
and
not
for
the
present
let
my
mother
and
your
father
know
i
do
want
to
alarm
them
and
i
must
not
let
my
affairs
interrupt
the
business
connexion
between
the
mill
and
the
hall
that
has
gone
on
for
so
many
years
the
promised
and
anne
told
the
adventure
his
brow
reddened
as
she
went
on
and
when
she
had
done
she
said
you
are
angry
do
do
anything
dreadful
will
you
remember
that
this
festus
will
most
likely
succeed
his
uncle
at
oxwell
in
spite
of
present
appearances
and
if
bob
succeeds
at
the
mill
there
should
be
no
enmity
between
them
true
i
wo
tell
bob
leave
him
to
me
where
is
derriman
now
on
his
way
home
i
suppose
when
i
have
seen
you
into
the
house
i
will
deal
with
him
quite
quietly
so
that
he
shall
say
nothing
about
it
appeal
to
him
do
perhaps
he
will
be
better
then
they
walked
on
together
loveday
seeming
to
experience
much
quiet
bliss
came
to
look
for
you
he
said
of
that
dear
sweet
letter
you
wrote
i
did
write
you
a
letter
she
admitted
with
misgiving
now
beginning
to
see
her
mistake
was
because
i
was
sorry
i
had
blamed
you
am
almost
glad
you
did
blame
me
said
john
cheerfully
if
you
had
not
the
letter
would
not
have
come
i
have
read
it
fifty
times
a
day
this
put
anne
into
an
unhappy
mood
and
they
proceeded
without
much
further
talk
till
the
mill
chimneys
were
visible
below
them
john
then
said
that
he
would
leave
her
to
go
in
by
herself
you
are
going
back
to
get
into
some
danger
on
my
account
ca
get
into
much
danger
with
such
a
fellow
as
he
can
i
said
john
smiling
no
she
answered
with
a
sudden
carelessness
of
tone
it
was
indispensable
that
he
should
be
undeceived
and
to
begin
the
process
by
taking
an
affectedly
light
view
of
his
personal
risks
was
perhaps
as
good
a
way
to
do
it
as
any
where
friendliness
was
construed
as
love
an
assumed
indifference
was
the
necessary
expression
for
friendliness
so
she
let
him
go
and
bidding
him
hasten
back
as
soon
as
he
could
went
down
the
hill
while
john
feet
retraced
the
upland
the
spent
the
whole
afternoon
and
evening
in
that
long
and
difficult
search
for
festus
derriman
crossing
the
down
at
the
end
of
the
second
hour
he
met
molly
and
loveday
the
gig
had
been
repaired
they
had
learnt
the
groundlessness
of
the
alarm
and
they
would
have
been
proceeding
happily
enough
but
for
their
anxiety
about
anne
john
told
them
shortly
that
she
had
got
a
lift
home
and
proceeded
on
his
way
the
worthy
object
of
his
search
had
in
the
meantime
been
plodding
homeward
on
foot
sulky
at
the
loss
of
his
charger
encumbered
with
his
sword
belts
high
boots
and
uniform
and
in
his
own
discomfiture
careless
whether
anne
garland
life
had
been
endangered
or
not
at
length
derriman
reached
a
place
where
the
road
ran
between
high
banks
one
of
which
he
mounted
and
paced
along
as
a
change
from
the
hard
trackway
ahead
of
him
he
saw
an
old
man
sitting
down
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
dust
of
the
road
as
if
resting
and
meditating
at
one
and
the
same
time
being
pretty
sure
that
he
recognized
his
uncle
in
that
venerable
figure
festus
came
forward
stealthily
till
he
was
immediately
above
the
old
man
back
the
latter
was
clothed
in
faded
nankeen
breeches
speckled
stockings
a
drab
hat
and
a
coat
which
had
once
been
light
blue
but
from
exposure
as
a
scarecrow
had
assumed
the
complexion
and
fibre
of
a
dried
the
farmer
was
in
fact
returning
to
the
hall
which
he
had
left
in
the
morning
some
time
later
than
his
nephew
to
seek
an
asylum
in
a
hollow
tree
about
two
miles
off
the
tree
was
so
situated
as
to
command
a
view
of
the
building
and
uncle
benjy
had
managed
to
clamber
up
inside
this
natural
fortification
high
enough
to
watch
his
residence
through
a
hole
in
the
bark
till
gathering
from
the
words
of
occasional
that
the
alarm
was
at
least
premature
he
had
ventured
into
daylight
again
he
was
now
engaged
in
abstractedly
tracing
a
diagram
in
the
dust
with
his
and
muttered
words
to
himself
aloud
presently
he
arose
and
went
on
his
way
without
turning
round
festus
was
curious
enough
to
descend
and
look
at
the
marks
they
represented
an
oblong
with
two
diagonals
and
a
little
square
in
the
middle
upon
the
diagonals
were
the
figures
and
and
on
each
side
of
the
parallelogram
stood
a
letter
signifying
the
point
of
the
compass
crazy
thing
is
running
in
his
head
now
said
festus
to
himself
with
supercilious
pity
recollecting
that
the
farmer
had
been
singing
those
very
numbers
earlier
in
the
morning
being
able
to
make
nothing
of
it
he
lengthened
his
strides
and
treading
on
tiptoe
overtook
his
relative
saluting
him
by
scratching
his
back
like
a
hen
the
startled
old
farmer
danced
round
like
a
top
and
gasping
said
as
he
perceived
his
nephew
festy
not
thrown
from
your
horse
and
killed
then
after
all
nunc
what
made
ye
think
that
passed
me
about
an
hour
ago
when
i
was
in
hiding
poor
timid
soul
of
me
for
i
had
nothing
to
lose
by
the
french
coming
and
he
looked
awful
with
the
stirrups
dangling
and
the
saddle
empty
is
a
gloomy
sight
festy
to
see
a
horse
cantering
without
a
rider
and
i
thought
you
had
been
feared
you
had
been
thrown
off
and
killed
as
dead
as
a
nit
your
dear
old
heart
for
being
so
anxious
and
what
pretty
picture
were
you
drawing
just
now
with
your
that
that
is
only
a
way
i
have
of
amusing
myself
it
showed
how
the
french
might
have
advanced
to
the
attack
you
know
such
trifles
fill
the
head
of
a
weak
old
man
like
me
the
place
where
something
is
hid
away
money
for
instance
said
the
farmer
reproachfully
always
know
i
use
the
old
glove
in
the
bedroom
cupboard
for
any
guinea
or
two
i
possess
course
i
do
said
festus
ironically
they
had
now
reached
a
lonely
inn
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
hall
and
the
farmer
not
responding
to
his
nephew
kind
invitation
to
come
in
and
treat
him
festus
entered
alone
he
was
dusty
draggled
and
weary
and
he
remained
at
the
tavern
long
the
in
the
meantime
having
searched
the
roads
in
vain
heard
in
the
course
of
the
evening
of
the
yeoman
arrival
at
this
place
and
that
he
would
probably
be
found
there
still
he
accordingly
approached
the
door
reaching
it
just
as
the
dusk
of
evening
changed
to
darkness
there
was
no
light
in
the
passage
but
john
pushed
on
at
hazard
inquired
for
derriman
and
was
told
that
he
would
be
found
in
the
back
parlour
alone
when
loveday
first
entered
the
apartment
he
was
unable
to
see
anything
but
following
the
guidance
of
a
vigorous
snoring
he
came
to
the
settle
upon
which
festus
lay
asleep
his
position
being
faintly
signified
by
the
shine
of
his
buttons
and
other
parts
of
his
uniform
john
laid
his
hand
upon
the
reclining
figure
and
shook
him
and
by
degrees
derriman
stopped
his
snore
and
sat
up
are
you
he
said
in
the
accents
of
a
man
who
has
been
drinking
hard
it
you
dear
anne
let
me
kiss
you
yes
i
will
your
mouth
you
pitiful
blockhead
i
teach
you
genteeler
manners
than
to
persecute
a
young
woman
in
that
way
and
taking
festus
by
the
ear
he
gave
it
a
good
pull
festus
broke
out
with
an
oath
and
struck
a
vague
blow
in
the
air
with
his
fist
whereupon
the
dealt
him
a
box
on
the
right
ear
and
a
similar
one
on
the
left
to
artistically
balance
the
first
festus
jumped
up
and
used
his
fists
wildly
but
without
any
definite
result
to
fight
do
ye
eh
said
john
you
ca
fight
you
great
baby
and
never
could
you
are
only
fit
to
be
smacked
and
he
dealt
festus
a
specimen
of
the
same
on
the
cheek
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
sir
no
o
you
are
loveday
the
young
man
she
going
to
be
married
to

suppose
dash
me
i
did
want
to
hurt

name

where
to
find

since
we
ca

this
pistols
or
swords
whichever
you
like
my
boy
take
that
and
that
so
that
you
may
not
forget
to
call
upon
me
and
again
he
smacked
the
yeoman
ears
and
cheeks
you
know
what
it
is
for
eh
loveday
sir
yes
i
mean
i
do
is
it
for
then
i
shall
keep
smacking
until
you

because

served
her
badly
damned
if
i
care
i
do
it
again
and
be
hanged
to
where
my
horse
champion
tell
me
that
and
he
hit
at
the
john
parried
this
attack
and
taking
him
firmly
by
the
collar
pushed
him
down
into
the
seat
saying
i
hold
till
you
beg
pardon
for
your
doings
do
you
want
any
more
of
it
do
you
and
he
shook
the
yeoman
to
a
sort
of
jelly
do
beg
pardon
no
i
do
i
say
this
that
you
shall
not
take
such
liberties
with
old
squire
derriman
nephew
you
dirty
miller
son
you
you
smut
in
the
corn
i
call
you
out
morning
and
have
my
revenge
course
you
will
that
what
i
came
for
and
pushing
him
back
into
the
corner
of
the
settle
loveday
went
out
of
the
house
feeling
considerable
satisfaction
at
having
got
himself
into
the
beginning
of
as
nice
a
quarrel
about
anne
garland
as
the
most
jealous
lover
could
desire
but
of
one
feature
in
this
curious
adventure
he
had
not
the
least
notion
that
festus
derriman
misled
by
the
darkness
the
fumes
of
his
potations
and
the
constant
sight
of
anne
and
bob
together
never
once
supposed
his
assailant
to
be
any
other
man
than
bob
believing
the
miles
away
there
was
a
moon
during
the
early
part
of
john
walk
home
but
when
he
had
arrived
within
a
mile
of
overcombe
the
sky
clouded
over
and
rain
suddenly
began
to
fall
with
some
violence
near
him
was
a
wooden
granary
on
tall
stone
staddles
and
perceiving
that
the
rain
was
only
a
thunderstorm
which
would
soon
pass
away
he
ascended
the
steps
and
entered
the
doorway
where
he
stood
watching
the
moon
through
the
streaming
rain
presently
to
his
surprise
he
beheld
a
female
figure
running
forward
with
great
rapidity
not
towards
the
granary
for
shelter
but
towards
open
ground
what
could
she
be
running
for
in
that
direction
the
answer
came
in
the
appearance
of
his
brother
bob
from
that
quarter
seated
on
the
back
of
his
father
heavy
horse
as
soon
as
the
woman
met
him
bob
dismounted
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
they
stood
locked
together
the
rain
beating
into
their
unconscious
forms
and
the
horse
looking
on
the
fell
back
inside
the
granary
and
threw
himself
on
a
heap
of
empty
sacks
which
lay
in
the
corner
he
had
recognized
the
woman
to
be
anne
here
he
reclined
in
a
stupor
till
he
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
voices
under
him
the
voices
of
anne
and
his
brother
who
having
at
last
discovered
that
they
were
getting
wet
had
taken
shelter
under
the
granary
floor
have
been
home
said
she
and
molly
have
both
got
back
long
ago
we
were
all
anxious
about
you
and
i
came
out
to
look
for
you
o
bob
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
again
john
might
have
heard
every
word
of
the
conversation
which
was
continued
in
the
same
strain
for
a
long
time
but
he
stopped
his
ears
and
would
not
still
they
remained
and
still
was
he
determined
that
they
should
not
see
him
with
the
conserved
hope
of
more
than
half
a
year
dashed
away
in
a
moment
he
could
yet
feel
that
the
cruelty
of
a
protest
would
be
even
greater
than
its
inutility
it
was
absolutely
by
his
own
contrivance
that
the
situation
had
been
shaped
bob
left
to
himself
would
long
ere
this
have
been
the
husband
of
another
woman
the
rain
decreased
and
the
lovers
went
on
john
looked
after
them
as
they
strolled
by
the
weak
moon
and
mist
bob
had
thrust
one
of
his
arms
through
the
rein
of
the
horse
and
the
other
was
round
waist
when
they
were
lost
behind
the
declivity
the
came
out
and
walked
homeward
even
more
slowly
than
they
as
he
went
on
his
face
put
off
its
complexion
of
despair
for
one
of
serene
resolve
for
the
first
time
in
his
dealings
with
friends
he
entered
upon
a
course
of
counterfeiting
set
his
features
to
conceal
his
thought
and
instructed
his
tongue
to
do
likewise
he
threw
fictitiousness
into
his
very
gait
even
now
when
there
was
nobody
to
see
him
and
struck
at
stems
of
wild
parsley
with
his
regimental
switch
as
he
had
used
to
do
when
soldiering
was
new
to
him
and
life
in
general
a
charming
experience
thus
cloaking
his
sickly
thought
he
descended
to
the
mill
as
the
others
had
done
before
him
occasionally
looking
down
upon
the
wet
road
to
notice
how
close
anne
little
tracks
were
to
bob
all
the
way
along
and
how
precisely
a
curve
in
his
course
was
followed
by
a
curve
in
hers
but
after
this
he
erected
his
head
and
walked
so
smartly
up
to
the
front
door
that
his
spurs
rang
through
the
court
they
had
all
reached
home
but
before
any
of
them
could
speak
he
cried
gaily
bob
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
by
god
how
are
you
my
boy
no
french
after
all
you
see
here
we
are
well
and
happy
together
again
good
providence
has
watched
over
us
said
loveday
cheerfully
in
all
times
and
places
we
are
in
god
hand
we
be
so
we
be
said
the
miller
who
still
shone
in
all
the
fierceness
of
uniform
now
we
a
drop
o
drink
none
said
david
coming
forward
with
a
drawn
face
said
the
miller
i
went
to
church
for
a
pike
to
defend
my
native
country
from
boney
i
pulled
out
the
spigots
of
all
the
barrels
maister
for
thinks
i
damn
him
since
we
ca
drink
it
ourselves
he
sha
have
it
nor
none
of
his
men
you
should
have
done
it
till
you
was
sure
he
come
said
the
miller
aghast
it
all
i
was
sure
said
david
sooner
see
churches
fall
than
good
drink
wasted
but
how
was
i
to
know
better
well
what
with
one
thing
and
another
this
day
will
cost
me
a
pretty
penny
said
loveday
bustling
off
to
the
cellar
which
he
found
to
be
several
inches
deep
in
stagnant
liquor
how
can
i
welcome
he
continued
hopelessly
on
his
return
to
the
room
go
and
see
what
he
done
ladled
up
a
drap
wi
a
spoon
said
david
bad
drinking
though
it
do
taste
a
little
of
the
floor
that
true
john
said
that
he
did
not
require
anything
at
all
and
then
they
all
sat
down
to
supper
and
were
very
temperately
gay
with
a
drop
of
mild
wine
which
loveday
found
in
the
bottom
of
a
jar
the
adhering
to
the
part
he
meant
to
play
gave
humorous
accounts
of
his
adventures
since
he
had
last
sat
there
he
told
them
that
the
season
was
to
be
a
very
lively
one
that
the
royal
family
was
coming
as
usual
and
many
other
interesting
things
so
that
when
he
left
them
to
return
to
barracks
few
would
have
supposed
the
british
army
to
contain
a
hearted
man
anne
was
the
only
one
who
doubted
the
reality
of
this
behaviour
when
she
had
gone
up
to
her
bedroom
she
stood
for
some
time
looking
at
the
wick
of
the
candle
as
if
it
were
a
painful
object
the
expression
of
her
face
being
shaped
by
the
conviction
that
john
afternoon
words
when
he
helped
her
out
of
the
way
of
champion
were
not
in
accordance
with
his
words
and
that
the
kiss
during
her
faintness
was
no
imaginary
one
but
in
the
blissful
circumstances
of
having
bob
at
hand
again
she
took
optimist
views
and
persuaded
herself
that
john
would
soon
begin
to
see
her
in
the
light
of
a
sister
xxix
a
dissembler
to
cursory
view
john
loveday
seemed
to
accomplish
this
with
amazing
ease
whenever
he
came
from
barracks
to
overcombe
which
was
once
or
twice
a
week
he
related
news
of
all
sorts
to
her
and
bob
with
infinite
zest
and
made
the
time
as
happy
a
one
as
had
ever
been
known
at
the
mill
save
for
himself
alone
he
said
nothing
of
festus
except
so
far
as
to
inform
anne
that
he
had
expected
to
see
him
and
been
disappointed
on
the
evening
after
the
king
arrival
at
his
seaside
residence
john
appeared
again
staying
to
supper
and
describing
the
royal
entry
the
many
tasteful
illuminations
and
transparencies
which
had
been
exhibited
the
quantities
of
tallow
candles
burnt
for
that
purpose
and
the
swarms
of
aristocracy
who
had
followed
the
king
thither
when
supper
was
over
bob
went
outside
the
house
to
shut
the
shutters
which
had
as
was
often
the
case
been
left
open
some
time
after
lights
were
kindled
within
john
still
sat
at
the
table
when
his
brother
approached
the
window
though
the
others
had
risen
and
retired
bob
was
struck
by
seeing
through
the
pane
how
john
face
had
changed
throughout
the
he
had
been
talking
to
anne
in
the
gay
tone
habitual
with
him
now
which
gave
greater
strangeness
to
the
gloom
of
his
present
appearance
he
remained
in
thought
for
a
moment
took
a
letter
from
his
opened
it
and
with
a
tender
smile
at
his
weakness
kissed
the
writing
before
restoring
it
to
its
place
the
letter
was
one
that
anne
had
written
to
him
at
exonbury
bob
stood
perplexed
and
then
a
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
john
from
brotherly
goodness
might
be
feigning
a
satisfaction
with
recent
events
which
he
did
not
feel
bob
now
made
a
noise
with
the
shutters
at
which
the
rose
and
went
out
bob
at
once
following
him
said
the
sailor
ingenuously
terribly
sorry
that
i
done
wrong
asked
his
brother
courting
our
little
anne
well
you
see
john
she
was
in
the
same
house
with
me
and
somehow
or
other
i
made
myself
her
beau
but
i
have
been
thinking
that
perhaps
you
had
the
first
claim
on
her
and
if
so
jack
i
make
way
for
i
i
do
care
for
her
much
you
know
not
so
very
much
and
can
give
her
up
very
well
it
is
nothing
serious
between
us
at
all
yes
john
you
try
to
get
her
i
can
look
elsewhere
bob
never
knew
how
much
he
loved
anne
till
he
found
himself
making
this
speech
of
renunciation
bob
you
are
mistaken
said
the
who
was
not
deceived
i
first
saw
her
i
admired
her
and
i
admire
her
now
and
like
her
i
like
her
so
well
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
marry
her
replied
bob
with
hesitation
thought
i
saw
you
looking
very
sad
as
if
you
were
in
love
i
saw
you
take
out
a
letter
in
short
that
what
it
was
disturbed
me
and
made
me
come
to
you
i
see
your
mistake
said
john
laughing
forcedly
at
this
minute
loveday
and
the
miller
who
were
taking
a
twilight
walk
in
the
garden
strolled
round
near
to
where
the
brothers
stood
she
talked
volubly
on
events
in
budmouth
as
most
people
did
at
this
time
they
tell
me
that
the
theatre
has
been
painted
up
afresh
she
was
saying
that
the
actors
have
come
for
the
season
with
the
most
lovely
actresses
that
ever
were
seen
when
they
had
passed
by
john
continued
in
love
bob
but
not
with
anne
who
is
it
then
said
the
mate
hopefully
of
the
actresses
at
the
theatre
john
replied
with
a
concoctive
look
at
the
vanishing
forms
of
and
loveday
is
a
very
lovely
woman
you
know
but
we
wo
say
anything
more
about
it
it
dashes
a
man
so
one
of
the
actresses
said
bob
with
open
mouth
do
you
say
anything
about
it
continued
the
heartily
do
want
it
known
no
i
wo
of
course
may
i
not
know
her
name
not
now
bob
i
can
not
tell
john
answered
and
with
truth
for
loveday
did
not
know
the
name
of
any
actress
in
the
world
when
his
brother
had
gone
captain
bob
hastened
off
in
a
state
of
great
animation
to
anne
whom
he
found
on
the
top
of
a
neighbouring
hillock
which
the
daylight
had
scarcely
as
yet
deserted
have
been
a
long
time
coming
sir
said
she
in
sprightly
tones
of
reproach
dearest
and
you
be
glad
to
hear
why
i
found
out
the
whole
mystery
yes
why
he
queer
and
everything
anne
looked
startled
up
to
the
gunnel
in
love
we
must
try
to
help
him
on
in
it
or
i
fear
he
go
like
help
him
she
asked
faintly
lost
his
heart
to
one
of
the
at
budmouth
and
i
think
she
slights
him
i
am
so
glad
she
exclaimed
that
his
venture
do
prosper
no
glad
he
so
sensible
how
long
is
it
since
that
alarm
of
the
french
weeks
honey
why
do
you
ask
can
forget
in
six
weeks
ca
they
bob
the
impression
that
john
had
really
kissed
her
still
remained
some
men
might
observed
bob
judicially
could
perhaps
john
might
i
could
forget
in
twenty
times
as
long
do
you
know
anne
i
half
thought
it
was
you
john
cared
about
and
it
was
a
weight
off
my
heart
when
he
said
he
did
he
say
he
did
he
assured
me
himself
that
the
only
person
in
the
hold
of
his
heart
was
this
lovely
and
nobody
else
i
should
like
to
see
her
so
should
i
would
rather
it
had
been
one
of
our
own
neighbours
girls
whose
birth
and
breeding
we
know
of
but
still
if
that
is
his
taste
i
hope
it
will
end
well
for
him
how
very
quick
he
has
been
i
certainly
wish
we
could
see
her
do
know
so
much
as
her
name
he
is
very
close
and
would
tell
a
thing
about
her
we
get
him
to
go
to
the
theatre
with
us
and
then
we
could
watch
him
and
easily
find
out
the
right
one
then
we
would
learn
if
she
is
a
good
young
woman
and
if
she
is
could
we
not
ask
her
here
and
so
make
it
smoother
for
him
he
has
been
very
gay
lately
that
means
budding
love
and
sometimes
between
his
gaieties
he
has
had
melancholy
moments
that
means
there
difficulty
bob
thought
her
plan
a
good
one
and
resolved
to
put
it
in
practice
on
the
first
available
evening
anne
was
very
curious
as
to
whether
john
did
really
cherish
a
new
passion
the
story
having
quite
surprised
her
possibly
it
was
true
six
weeks
had
passed
since
john
had
shown
a
single
symptom
of
the
old
attachment
and
what
could
not
that
space
of
time
effect
in
the
heart
of
a
soldier
whose
very
profession
it
was
to
leave
girls
behind
him
after
this
john
loveday
did
not
come
to
see
them
for
nearly
a
month
a
neglect
which
was
set
down
by
bob
as
an
additional
proof
that
his
brother
affections
were
no
longer
exclusively
centred
in
his
old
home
when
at
last
he
did
arrive
and
the
was
mentioned
to
him
the
flush
of
consciousness
which
anne
expected
to
see
upon
his
face
was
unaccountably
absent
bob
i
should
very
well
like
to
go
to
the
theatre
he
replied
heartily
is
going
besides
anne
bob
told
him
and
then
it
seemed
to
occur
to
the
major
that
something
had
been
expected
of
him
he
rose
and
said
privately
to
bob
with
some
confusion
yes
of
course
we
go
as
i
am
connected
with
one
of
the
in
short
i
can
get
you
in
for
nothing
you
know
at
least
let
me
manage
everything
yes
i
wonder
you
did
propose
to
take
us
before
jack
and
let
us
have
a
good
look
at
her
ought
to
have
you
shall
go
on
a
king
night
you
wo
want
me
to
point
her
out
bob
i
have
my
reasons
at
present
for
asking
it
be
content
with
guessing
said
his
brother
when
the
gallant
john
was
gone
anne
observed
how
he
is
changed
i
watched
him
he
showed
no
feeling
even
when
you
burst
upon
him
suddenly
with
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
must
be
because
his
suit
do
fay
said
captain
bob
xxx
at
the
theatre
royal
in
two
or
three
days
a
message
arrived
asking
them
to
attend
at
the
theatre
on
the
coming
evening
with
the
added
request
that
they
would
dress
in
their
gayest
clothes
to
do
justice
to
the
places
taken
accordingly
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
they
drove
off
bob
having
clothed
himself
in
a
splendid
suit
recently
purchased
as
an
attempt
to
bring
himself
nearer
to
anne
style
when
they
appeared
in
public
together
as
finished
off
by
this
dashing
and
really
fashionable
attire
he
was
the
perfection
of
a
beau
in
the
pantaloons
and
boots
of
the
newest
make
yards
and
yards
of
muslin
wound
round
his
neck
forming
a
sort
of
asylum
for
the
lower
part
of
his
face
two
fancy
waistcoats
and
like
circular
shaving
glasses
the
absurd
extreme
of
female
fashion
which
was
to
wear
muslin
dresses
in
january
was
at
this
time
equalled
by
that
of
the
men
who
wore
clothes
enough
in
august
to
melt
them
nobody
would
have
guessed
from
bob
presentation
now
that
he
had
ever
been
aloft
on
a
dark
night
in
the
atlantic
or
knew
the
hundred
ingenuities
that
could
be
performed
with
a
rope
end
and
a
as
well
as
his
mother
tongue
it
was
a
day
of
days
anne
wore
her
celebrated
celestial
blue
pelisse
her
leghorn
hat
and
her
muslin
dress
with
the
waist
under
the
arms
the
latter
being
decorated
with
excellent
honiton
lace
bought
of
the
woman
who
travelled
from
that
place
to
overcombe
and
its
neighbourhood
with
a
basketful
of
her
own
manufacture
and
a
cushion
on
which
she
worked
by
the
wayside
john
met
the
lovers
at
the
inn
outside
the
town
and
after
stabling
the
horse
they
entered
the
town
together
the
informing
them
that
the
had
never
been
so
full
before
that
the
court
the
prince
of
wales
and
everybody
of
consequence
was
there
and
that
an
attic
could
scarcely
be
got
for
money
the
king
had
gone
for
a
cruise
in
his
yacht
and
they
would
be
in
time
to
see
him
land
then
drums
and
fifes
were
heard
and
in
a
minute
or
two
they
saw
sergeant
stanner
advancing
along
the
street
with
a
firm
countenance
fiery
poll
and
rigid
staring
eyes
in
front
of
his
the
sword
was
drawn
and
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
inches
along
its
shining
blade
were
impaled
fluttering
notes
to
express
the
lavish
bounty
that
was
offered
he
gave
a
stern
suppressed
nod
of
friendship
to
our
people
and
passed
by
next
they
came
up
to
a
waggon
bowered
over
with
leaves
and
flowers
so
that
the
men
inside
could
hardly
be
seen
to
see
the
king
hurrah
cried
a
voice
within
and
turning
they
saw
through
the
leaves
the
nose
and
face
of
cripplestraw
the
waggon
contained
all
derriman
workpeople
your
master
here
said
john
sir
but
young
maister
is
coming
to
fetch
us
at
nine
in
case
we
should
be
too
blind
to
drive
home
where
is
he
now
mind
said
anne
impatiently
at
which
the
obediently
moved
on
by
the
time
they
reached
the
pier
it
was
six
the
royal
yacht
was
returning
a
fact
announced
by
the
ships
in
the
harbour
firing
a
salute
the
king
came
ashore
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
returned
the
salutations
of
the
crowd
in
his
old
indiscriminate
fashion
while
this
cheering
and
waving
of
handkerchiefs
was
going
on
anne
stood
between
the
two
brothers
who
protectingly
joined
their
hands
behind
her
back
as
if
she
were
a
delicate
piece
of
statuary
that
a
push
might
damage
soon
the
king
had
passed
and
receiving
the
military
salutes
of
the
piquet
joined
the
queen
and
princesses
at
gloucester
lodge
the
homely
house
of
red
brick
in
which
he
unostentatiously
resided
as
there
was
yet
some
little
time
before
the
theatre
would
open
they
strayed
upon
the
velvet
sands
and
listened
to
the
songs
of
the
sailors
one
of
whom
extemporized
for
the
occasion
road
the
king
aboard
the
king
aboard
portland
road
the
king
aboard
we
weighed
and
sailed
from
portland
road
when
they
had
looked
on
awhile
at
the
combats
at
which
were
in
progress
hard
by
and
seen
the
sum
of
five
guineas
handed
over
to
the
modest
gentleman
who
had
broken
most
heads
they
returned
to
gloucester
lodge
whence
the
king
and
other
members
of
his
family
now
reappeared
and
drove
at
a
slow
trot
round
to
the
theatre
in
carriages
drawn
by
the
hanoverian
white
horses
that
were
so
well
known
in
the
town
at
this
date
when
anne
and
bob
entered
the
theatre
they
found
that
john
had
taken
excellent
places
and
concluded
that
he
had
got
them
for
nothing
through
the
influence
of
the
lady
of
his
choice
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
paid
full
prices
for
those
two
seats
like
any
other
outsider
and
even
then
had
a
difficulty
in
getting
them
it
being
a
king
night
when
they
were
settled
he
himself
retired
to
an
obscure
part
of
the
pit
from
which
the
stage
was
scarcely
visible
can
see
beautifully
said
bob
in
an
aristocratic
voice
as
he
took
a
delicate
pinch
of
snuff
and
drew
out
the
magnificent
brought
home
from
the
east
for
such
occasions
i
am
afraid
poor
john
ca
see
at
all
we
can
see
him
replied
anne
notice
by
his
face
which
of
them
it
is
he
is
so
charmed
with
the
light
of
that
corner
candle
falls
right
upon
his
cheek
by
this
time
the
king
had
appeared
in
his
place
which
was
overhung
by
a
canopy
of
crimson
satin
fringed
with
gold
about
twenty
places
were
occupied
by
the
royal
family
and
suite
and
beyond
them
was
a
crowd
of
powdered
and
glittering
personages
of
fashion
completely
filling
the
centre
of
the
little
building
though
the
king
so
frequently
patronized
the
local
stage
during
these
years
that
the
crush
was
not
inconvenient
the
curtain
rose
and
the
play
began
it
was
one
of
colman
who
at
this
time
enjoyed
great
popularity
and
bannister
supported
the
leading
character
anne
with
her
hand
privately
clasped
in
bob
and
looking
as
if
she
did
not
know
it
partly
watched
the
piece
and
partly
the
face
of
the
impressionable
john
who
had
so
soon
transferred
his
affections
elsewhere
she
had
not
long
to
wait
when
a
certain
one
of
the
subordinate
ladies
of
the
comedy
entered
on
the
stage
the
major
in
his
corner
not
only
looked
conscious
but
started
and
gazed
with
parted
lips
must
be
the
one
whispered
anne
quickly
he
is
agitated
she
turned
to
bob
but
at
the
same
moment
his
hand
convulsively
closed
upon
hers
as
he
too
strangely
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
lady
is
it
anne
looked
from
one
to
the
other
without
regarding
the
stage
at
all
her
answer
came
in
the
voice
of
the
actress
who
now
spoke
for
the
first
time
the
accents
were
those
of
miss
matilda
johnson
one
thought
rushed
into
both
their
minds
on
the
instant
and
bob
was
the
first
to
utter
it
is
she
the
woman
of
his
choice
after
all
so
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
murmured
anne
but
as
may
be
imagined
the
unfortunate
john
was
as
much
surprised
by
this
rencounter
as
the
other
two
until
this
moment
he
had
been
in
utter
ignorance
of
the
theatrical
company
and
all
that
pertained
to
it
moreover
much
as
he
knew
of
miss
johnson
he
was
not
aware
that
she
had
ever
been
trained
in
her
youth
as
an
actress
and
that
after
lapsing
into
straits
and
difficulties
for
a
couple
of
years
she
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
again
procure
an
engagement
here
the
though
not
prominently
seated
had
been
seen
by
matilda
already
who
had
observed
still
more
plainly
her
old
betrothed
and
anne
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
john
was
not
concerned
on
his
own
account
at
being
face
to
face
with
her
but
at
the
extraordinary
suspicion
that
this
conjuncture
must
revive
in
the
minds
of
his
best
beloved
friends
after
some
moments
of
pained
reflection
he
tapped
his
knee
i
wo
explain
it
shall
go
as
it
is
he
said
them
think
her
mine
better
that
than
the
truth
after
all
had
personal
prominence
in
the
scene
been
at
this
moment
proportioned
to
intentness
of
feeling
the
whole
audience
regal
and
otherwise
would
have
faded
into
an
indistinct
mist
of
background
leaving
as
the
sole
emergent
and
telling
figures
bob
and
anne
at
one
point
the
on
the
left
hand
and
matilda
at
the
opposite
corner
of
the
stage
but
fortunately
the
deadlock
of
awkward
suspense
into
which
all
four
had
fallen
was
terminated
by
an
accident
a
messenger
entered
the
king
box
with
despatches
there
was
an
instant
pause
in
the
performance
the
being
opened
the
king
read
for
a
few
moments
with
great
interest
the
eyes
of
the
whole
house
including
those
of
anne
garland
being
anxiously
fixed
upon
his
face
for
terrible
events
fell
as
unexpectedly
as
thunderbolts
at
this
critical
time
of
our
history
the
king
at
length
beckoned
to
lord
who
was
immediately
behind
him
the
play
was
again
stopped
and
the
contents
of
the
despatch
were
publicly
communicated
to
the
audience
sir
robert
calder
cruising
off
finisterre
had
come
in
sight
of
villeneuve
and
made
the
signal
for
action
which
though
checked
by
the
weather
had
resulted
in
the
capture
of
two
spanish
ships
and
the
retreat
of
villeneuve
into
ferrol
the
news
was
received
with
truly
national
feeling
if
noise
might
be
taken
as
an
index
of
patriotism
britannia
was
called
for
and
sung
by
the
whole
house
but
the
importance
of
the
event
was
far
from
being
recognized
at
this
time
and
bob
loveday
as
he
sat
there
and
heard
it
had
very
little
conception
how
it
would
bear
upon
his
destiny
this
parenthetic
excitement
diverted
for
a
few
minutes
the
eyes
of
bob
and
anne
from
the
and
when
the
play
proceeded
and
they
looked
back
to
his
corner
he
was
gone
just
slipped
round
to
talk
to
her
behind
the
scenes
said
bob
knowingly
we
go
too
and
tease
him
for
a
sly
dog
i
would
rather
not
we
go
home
then
unless
her
presence
is
too
much
for
you
not
at
all
we
stay
here
ah
there
she
is
again
they
sat
on
and
listened
to
matilda
speeches
which
she
delivered
with
such
delightful
coolness
that
they
soon
began
to
considerably
interest
one
of
the
party
what
a
nerve
the
young
woman
has
he
said
at
last
in
tones
of
admiration
and
gazing
at
miss
johnson
with
all
his
might
all
jack
taste
is
not
so
bad
she
really
deuced
clever
i
go
home
if
you
wish
to
said
anne
quickly
no
let
us
see
how
she
fleets
herself
off
that
bit
of
a
scrape
playing
at
now
well
what
a
hand
she
is
at
it
to
be
sure
anne
said
no
more
but
waited
on
supremely
uncomfortable
and
almost
tearful
she
began
to
feel
that
she
did
not
like
life
particularly
well
it
was
too
complicated
she
saw
nothing
of
the
scene
and
only
longed
to
get
away
and
to
get
bob
away
with
her
at
last
the
curtain
fell
on
the
final
act
and
then
began
the
farce
of
song
no
supper
matilda
did
not
appear
in
this
piece
and
anne
again
inquired
if
they
should
go
home
this
time
bob
agreed
and
taking
her
under
his
care
with
redoubled
affection
to
make
up
for
the
species
of
coma
which
had
seized
upon
his
heart
for
a
time
he
quietly
accompanied
her
out
of
the
house
when
they
emerged
upon
the
esplanade
the
august
moon
was
shining
across
the
sea
from
the
direction
of
aldhelm
head
bob
unconsciously
loitered
and
turned
towards
the
pier
reaching
the
end
of
the
promenade
they
surveyed
the
quivering
waters
in
silence
for
some
time
until
a
long
dark
line
shot
from
behind
the
promontory
of
the
nothe
and
swept
forward
into
the
harbour
boat
is
that
said
anne
seems
to
be
some
frigate
lying
in
the
roads
said
bob
carelessly
as
he
brought
anne
round
with
a
gentle
pressure
of
his
arm
and
bent
his
steps
towards
the
homeward
end
of
the
town
meanwhile
miss
johnson
having
finished
her
duties
for
that
evening
rapidly
changed
her
dress
and
went
out
likewise
the
prominent
position
which
anne
and
captain
bob
had
occupied
side
by
side
in
the
theatre
left
her
no
alternative
but
to
suppose
that
the
situation
was
arranged
by
bob
as
a
species
of
defiance
to
herself
and
her
heart
such
as
it
was
became
proportionately
embittered
against
him
in
spite
of
the
rise
in
her
fortunes
miss
johnson
still
remembered
and
always
would
remember
her
humiliating
departure
from
overcombe
and
it
had
been
to
her
even
a
more
grievous
thing
that
bob
had
acquiesced
in
his
ruling
than
that
john
had
determined
it
at
the
time
of
setting
out
she
was
sustained
by
a
firm
faith
that
bob
would
follow
her
and
nullify
his
brother
scheme
but
though
she
waited
bob
never
came
she
passed
along
by
the
houses
facing
the
sea
and
scanned
the
shore
the
footway
and
the
open
road
close
to
her
which
illuminated
by
the
slanting
moon
to
a
great
brightness
sparkled
with
minute
facets
of
crystallized
salts
from
the
water
sprinkled
there
during
the
day
the
promenaders
at
the
further
edge
appeared
in
dark
profiles
and
beyond
them
was
the
grey
sea
parted
into
two
masses
by
the
tapering
braid
of
moonlight
across
the
waves
two
forms
crossed
this
line
at
a
startling
nearness
to
her
she
marked
them
at
once
as
anne
and
bob
loveday
they
were
walking
slowly
and
in
the
earnestness
of
their
discourse
were
oblivious
of
the
presence
of
any
human
beings
save
themselves
matilda
stood
motionless
till
they
had
passed
i
love
them
she
said
treading
the
initial
step
of
her
walk
onwards
with
a
vehemence
that
walking
did
not
demand
do
i
especially
one
said
a
voice
at
her
elbow
and
a
man
wheeled
round
her
and
looked
in
her
face
which
had
been
fully
exposed
to
the
moon
who
are
you
she
asked
you
remember
we
walked
some
way
together
towards
overcombe
earlier
in
the
summer
matilda
looked
more
closely
and
perceived
that
the
speaker
was
derriman
in
plain
clothes
he
continued
are
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
theatre
i
know
may
i
ask
why
you
said
in
such
a
queer
way
that
you
loved
that
couple
a
queer
way
as
if
you
hated
them
do
mind
your
knowing
that
i
have
good
reason
to
hate
them
you
do
too
it
seems
man
said
festus
savagely
to
me
one
night
about
that
very
woman
insulted
me
before
i
could
put
myself
on
my
guard
and
ran
away
before
i
could
come
up
with
him
and
avenge
myself
the
woman
tricks
me
at
every
turn
i
want
to
part
why
do
you
there
a
splendid
opportunity
do
you
see
that
soldier
walking
along
he
a
marine
he
looks
into
the
gallery
of
the
theatre
every
night
and
he
in
connexion
with
the
that
came
ashore
just
now
from
the
frigate
lying
in
portland
roads
they
are
often
here
for
men
our
boatmen
dread
we
have
only
to
tell
him
that
loveday
is
a
seaman
to
be
clear
of
him
this
very
night
said
festus
my
arm
and
come
this
way
they
walked
across
to
the
footway
night
sergeant
is
sir
for
hands
i
suppose

not
to
be
known
sir
we
do
begin
till
half
past
ten

a
pity
you
do
begin
now
i
could
show
excellent
game
that
little
nest
of
fellows
at
the
old
rooms
in
cove
row
i
have
just
heard
of
come
here
festus
with
miss
johnson
on
his
arm
led
the
sergeant
quickly
along
the
parade
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
narrows
the
lovers
who
walked
but
slowly
were
visible
in
front
of
them
your
man
he
said
buck
in
pantaloons
and
a
looking
like
a
squire
months
ago
he
was
mate
of
the
brig
pewit
but
his
father
has
made
money
and
keeps
him
at
home
now
you
tell
of
it
there
a
hint
of
sea
legs
about
him
the
young
beau
name
tell
whispered
matilda
impulsively
clutching
festus
arm
but
festus
had
already
said
loveday
son
of
the
miller
at
overcombe
you
may
find
several
likely
fellows
in
that
neighbourhood
the
marine
said
that
he
would
bear
it
in
mind
and
they
left
him
wish
you
had
not
told
said
matilda
tearfully
the
worst
my
eyes
now
listen
to
that
why
you
old
stager
you
was
as
well
agreed
as
i
come
now
has
he
used
you
badly
matilda
acrimony
returned
was
down
on
my
luck
or
he
would
have
had
the
chance
she
said
then
let
things
be
xxxi
midnight
visitors
miss
garland
and
loveday
walked
leisurely
to
the
inn
and
called
for
while
the
hostler
was
bringing
it
round
the
landlord
who
knew
bob
and
his
family
well
spoke
to
him
quietly
in
the
passage
this
then
because
you
want
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
black
diamond
chaps
with
an
admiring
glance
at
bob
costume
black
diamond
said
bob
and
anne
turned
pale
hove
in
sight
just
after
dark
and
at
nine
a
boat
having
more
than
a
dozen
marines
on
board
with
cloaks
on
rowed
into
harbour
bob
reflected
there
be
a
press
depend
upon
it
he
said
wo
know
you
will
they
bob
said
anne
anxiously
certainly
wo
know
him
for
a
seaman
now
remarked
the
landlord
laughing
and
again
surveying
bob
up
and
down
if
i
was
you
two
i
should
drive
straight
and
quiet
and
be
very
busy
in
the
mill
all
mr
loveday
they
drove
away
and
when
they
had
got
onward
out
of
the
town
anne
strained
her
eyes
wistfully
towards
portland
its
dark
contour
lying
like
a
whale
on
the
sea
was
just
perceptible
in
the
gloom
as
the
background
to
ships
lights
nearer
at
hand
ca
make
you
go
now
you
are
a
gentleman
tradesman
can
they
she
asked
they
want
me
they
can
have
me
dearest
i
have
often
said
i
ought
to
volunteer
not
care
about
me
at
all
is
just
that
that
keeps
me
at
home
i
wo
leave
you
if
i
can
help
it
can
not
make
such
a
vast
difference
to
the
country
whether
one
man
goes
or
stays
but
if
you
want
to
go
you
had
better
and
not
mind
us
at
all
bob
put
a
period
to
her
speech
by
a
mark
of
affection
to
which
history
affords
many
parallels
in
every
age
she
said
no
more
about
the
black
diamond
but
whenever
they
ascended
a
hill
she
turned
her
head
to
look
at
the
lights
in
portland
roads
and
the
grey
expanse
of
intervening
sea
though
captain
bob
had
stated
that
he
did
not
wish
to
volunteer
and
would
not
leave
her
if
he
could
help
it
the
remark
required
some
qualification
that
anne
was
charming
and
loving
enough
to
chain
him
anywhere
was
true
but
he
had
begun
to
find
the
terribly
irksome
at
times
often
during
the
last
month
when
standing
among
the
rumbling
cogs
in
his
new
miller
suit
which
ill
became
him
he
had
yawned
thought
wistfully
of
the
old
and
the
waters
of
the
deep
blue
sea
his
dread
of
displeasing
his
father
by
showing
anything
of
this
change
of
sentiment
was
great
yet
he
might
have
braved
it
but
for
knowing
that
his
marriage
with
anne
which
he
hoped
might
take
place
the
next
year
was
dependent
entirely
upon
his
adherence
to
the
mill
business
even
were
his
father
indifferent
loveday
would
never
intrust
her
only
daughter
to
the
hands
of
a
husband
who
would
be
away
from
home
of
his
time
but
though
apart
from
anne
he
was
not
averse
to
seafaring
in
itself
to
be
smuggled
thither
by
the
machinery
of
a
was
intolerable
and
the
process
of
seizing
stunning
pinioning
and
carrying
off
unwilling
hands
was
one
which
bob
as
a
man
had
always
determined
to
hold
out
against
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
hence
as
they
went
towards
home
he
frequently
listened
for
sounds
behind
him
but
hearing
none
he
assured
his
sweetheart
that
they
were
safe
for
that
night
at
least
the
mill
was
still
going
when
they
arrived
though
old
loveday
was
not
to
be
seen
he
had
retired
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
horse
hoofs
in
the
lane
leaving
bob
to
watch
the
grinding
till
three
when
the
elder
would
rise
and
bob
withdraw
to
bed
a
frequent
arrangement
between
them
since
bob
had
taken
the
place
of
grinder
having
reached
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
anne
threw
open
the
window
for
she
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
going
to
bed
just
yet
the
tale
of
the
black
diamond
had
disturbed
her
by
a
slow
insidious
process
that
was
worse
than
sudden
fright
her
window
looked
into
the
court
before
the
house
now
wrapped
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
the
hill
and
she
leaned
upon
its
sill
listening
intently
she
could
have
heard
any
strange
sound
distinctly
enough
in
one
direction
but
in
the
other
all
low
noises
were
absorbed
in
the
patter
of
the
mill
and
the
rush
of
water
down
the
race
however
what
she
heard
came
from
the
hitherto
silent
side
and
was
intelligible
in
a
moment
as
being
the
footsteps
of
men
she
tried
to
think
they
were
some
late
stragglers
from
budmouth
alas
no
the
tramp
was
too
regular
for
that
of
villagers
she
hastily
turned
extinguished
the
candle
and
listened
again
as
they
were
on
the
main
road
there
was
after
all
every
probability
that
the
party
would
pass
the
bridge
which
gave
access
to
the
mill
court
without
turning
in
upon
it
or
even
noticing
that
such
an
entrance
existed
in
this
again
she
was
disappointed
they
crossed
into
the
front
without
a
pause
the
pulsations
of
her
heart
became
a
turmoil
now
for
why
should
these
men
if
they
were
the
and
strangers
to
the
locality
have
supposed
that
a
sailor
was
to
be
found
here
the
younger
of
the
two
millers
loveday
being
never
seen
now
in
any
garb
which
could
suggest
that
he
was
other
than
a
miller
pure
like
his
father
one
of
the
men
spoke
am
not
sure
that
we
are
in
the
right
place
he
said
is
a
mill
anyhow
said
another
lots
about
here
come
this
way
a
moment
with
your
light
two
of
the
group
went
towards
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
yard
and
when
they
reached
it
a
dark
lantern
was
opened
the
rays
being
directed
upon
the
front
of
the
miller
waggon
loveday
and
son
overcombe
mill
continued
the
man
reading
from
the
waggon
son
you
see
is
lately
painted
in
that
our
man
he
moved
to
turn
off
the
light
but
before
he
had
done
so
it
flashed
over
the
forms
of
the
speakers
and
revealed
a
sergeant
a
naval
officer
and
a
file
of
marines
anne
waited
to
see
no
more
when
bob
stayed
up
to
grind
as
he
was
doing
he
often
sat
in
his
room
instead
of
remaining
all
the
time
in
the
mill
and
this
room
was
an
isolated
chamber
over
the
bakehouse
which
could
not
be
reached
without
going
downstairs
and
ascending
the
that
served
for
his
staircase
anne
descended
in
the
dark
clambered
up
the
ladder
and
saw
that
light
strayed
through
the
chink
below
the
door
his
window
faced
towards
the
garden
and
hence
the
light
could
not
as
yet
have
been
seen
by
the
dear
bob
she
said
through
the
keyhole
out
your
light
and
run
out
of
the
said
bob
leisurely
knocking
the
ashes
from
the
pipe
he
had
been
smoking
have
come
by
god
who
can
have
blown
upon
me
all
right
dearest
i
game
anne
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
descended
the
ladder
and
ran
to
the
hastily
unbolting
it
to
save
bob
time
and
gently
opening
it
in
readiness
for
him
she
had
no
sooner
done
this
than
she
felt
hands
laid
upon
her
shoulder
from
without
and
a
voice
exclaiming
how
we
doos
it
quite
an
obleeging
young
man
though
the
hands
held
her
rather
roughly
anne
did
not
mind
for
herself
and
turning
she
cried
desperately
in
tones
intended
to
reach
bob
ears
are
at
the
try
the
front
but
inexperienced
miss
garland
little
knew
the
shrewd
habits
of
the
gentlemen
she
had
to
deal
with
who
well
used
to
this
sort
of
pastime
had
already
posted
themselves
at
every
outlet
from
the
premises
the
lantern
shouted
the
fellow
who
held
her
is
a
girl
i
half
thought
so
here
is
a
way
in
he
continued
to
his
comrades
hastening
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
which
led
to
bob
room
d
want
said
bob
quietly
opening
the
door
and
showing
himself
still
radiant
in
the
full
dress
that
he
had
worn
with
such
effect
at
the
theatre
royal
which
he
had
been
about
to
change
for
his
mill
suit
when
anne
gave
the
alarm
gentleman
ca
be
the
right
one
observed
a
marine
rather
impressed
by
bob
appearance
yes
that
the
man
said
the
sergeant
take
it
quietly
my
young
you
look
as
if
you
meant
to
and
is
wise
of
ye
are
you
going
to
take
me
said
bob
aboard
the
black
diamond
if
you
choose
to
take
the
bounty
and
come
voluntarily
you
be
allowed
to
go
ashore
whenever
your
ship
in
port
if
you
do
and
we
got
to
pinion
ye
you
will
not
have
your
liberty
at
all
as
you
must
come
you
do
the
first
if
you
any
brains
whatever
bob
temper
began
to
rise
you
talk
so
large
about
your
pinioning
my
man
when
i
settled
or
never
young
interrupted
his
informant
what
jabber
is
this
going
on
said
the
lieutenant
stepping
forward
your
man
one
of
the
marines
set
foot
on
the
ladder
but
at
the
same
moment
a
shoe
from
bob
hand
hit
the
lantern
with
directness
knocking
it
clean
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
man
who
held
it
in
spite
of
the
darkness
they
began
to
scramble
up
the
ladder
bob
thereupon
shut
the
door
which
being
but
of
slight
construction
was
as
he
knew
only
a
momentary
defence
but
it
gained
him
time
enough
to
open
the
window
gather
up
his
legs
upon
the
sill
and
spring
across
into
the
growing
without
he
alighted
without
much
hurt
beyond
a
few
scratches
from
the
boughs
a
shower
of
falling
apples
testifying
to
the
force
of
his
leap
he
is
shouted
several
below
who
had
seen
bob
figure
flying
like
a
raven
across
the
sky
there
was
stillness
for
a
moment
in
the
tree
then
the
fugitive
made
haste
to
climb
out
upon
a
branch
towards
the
garden
at
which
the
men
beneath
all
rushed
in
that
direction
to
catch
him
as
he
dropped
saying
may
as
well
come
down
old
boy
was
a
spry
jump
and
we
give
ye
credit
for
the
latter
movement
of
loveday
had
been
a
mere
feint
partly
hidden
by
the
leaves
he
glided
back
to
the
other
part
of
the
tree
from
whence
it
was
easy
to
jump
upon
a
this
intention
they
did
not
appear
to
suspect
which
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
sliding
down
the
slope
and
entering
the
back
door
of
the
mill
here
he
here
the
men
exclaimed
running
back
from
the
tree
by
this
time
they
had
obtained
another
light
and
pursued
him
closely
along
the
back
quarters
of
the
mill
bob
had
entered
the
lower
room
seized
hold
of
the
chain
by
which
the
were
hoisted
from
story
to
story
by
connexion
with
the
and
pulled
the
rope
that
hung
alongside
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
it
into
gear
the
foremost
pursuers
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
captain
bob
legs
and
vanishing
through
the
in
the
joists
overhead
his
person
having
been
whirled
up
by
the
machinery
like
any
bag
of
flour
and
the
trap
falling
to
behind
him
gone
up
by
the
hoist
said
the
sergeant
running
up
the
ladder
in
the
corner
to
the
next
floor
and
elevating
the
light
just
in
time
to
see
bob
suspended
figure
ascending
in
the
same
way
through
the
same
sort
of
trap
into
the
second
floor
the
second
trap
also
fell
together
behind
him
and
he
was
lost
to
view
as
before
it
was
more
difficult
to
follow
now
there
was
only
a
flimsy
little
ladder
and
the
men
ascended
cautiously
when
they
stepped
out
upon
the
loft
it
was
empty
must
ha
let
go
here
said
one
of
the
marines
who
knew
more
about
mills
than
the
others
he
had
held
fast
a
moment
longer
he
would
have
been
dashed
against
that
beam
they
looked
up
the
hook
by
which
bob
had
held
on
had
ascended
to
the
roof
and
was
winding
round
the
cylinder
nothing
was
visible
elsewhere
but
boarded
divisions
like
the
stalls
of
a
stable
on
each
side
of
the
stage
they
stood
upon
these
compartments
being
more
or
less
heaped
up
with
wheat
and
barley
in
the
grain
he
buried
himself
in
the
corn
the
whole
crew
jumped
into
the
and
stirred
about
their
yellow
contents
but
neither
arm
leg
nor
was
uncovered
they
removed
sacks
peeped
among
the
rafters
of
the
roof
but
to
no
purpose
the
lieutenant
began
to
fume
at
the
loss
of
time
cursed
fools
to
let
the
man
go
why
look
here
what
this
he
had
opened
the
door
by
which
sacks
were
taken
in
from
waggons
without
and
dangling
from
the
projecting
above
it
was
the
rope
used
in
lifting
them
the
way
he
went
down
the
officer
continued
man
gone
amidst
mumblings
and
curses
the
gang
descended
the
pair
of
ladders
and
came
into
the
open
air
but
captain
bob
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
when
they
reached
the
front
door
of
the
house
the
miller
was
standing
on
the
threshold
half
dressed
son
is
a
clever
fellow
miller
said
the
lieutenant
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
him
if
he
had
come
quiet
a
matter
of
opinion
said
loveday
have
no
doubt
that
he
in
the
house
may
be
and
he
may
not
you
know
where
he
is
do
not
and
if
i
did
i
should
tell
heard
steps
beating
up
the
road
sir
said
the
sergeant
they
turned
from
the
door
and
leaving
four
of
the
marines
to
keep
watch
round
the
house
the
remainder
of
the
party
marched
into
the
lane
as
far
as
where
the
other
road
branched
off
while
they
were
pausing
to
decide
which
course
to
take
one
of
the
soldiers
held
up
the
light
a
black
object
was
discernible
upon
the
ground
before
them
and
they
found
it
to
be
a
hat
the
hat
of
bob
loveday
are
on
the
track
cried
the
sergeant
deciding
for
this
direction
they
tore
on
rapidly
and
the
footsteps
previously
heard
became
audible
again
increasing
in
clearness
which
told
that
they
gained
upon
the
fugitive
who
in
another
five
minutes
stopped
and
turned
the
rays
of
the
candle
fell
upon
anne
do
you
want
she
said
showing
her
frightened
face
they
made
no
reply
but
wheeled
round
and
left
her
she
sank
down
on
the
bank
to
rest
having
done
all
she
could
it
was
she
who
had
taken
down
bob
hat
from
a
nail
and
dropped
it
at
the
turning
with
the
view
of
misleading
them
till
he
should
have
got
clear
off
xxxii
deliverance
but
anne
garland
was
too
anxious
to
remain
long
away
from
the
centre
of
operations
when
she
got
back
she
found
that
the
were
standing
in
the
court
discussing
their
next
move
no
more
time
here
the
lieutenant
said
more
villages
to
visit
and
the
nearest
three
miles
off
there
nobody
else
in
this
place
and
we
ca
come
back
again
when
they
were
moving
away
one
of
the
private
marines
who
had
kept
his
eye
on
anne
and
noticed
her
distress
contrived
to
say
in
a
whisper
as
he
passed
her
are
coming
back
again
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
get
light
that
only
said
to
deceive
keep
your
young
man
out
of
the
way
they
went
as
they
had
come
and
the
little
household
then
met
together
loveday
having
by
this
time
dressed
herself
and
come
down
a
long
and
anxious
discussion
followed
must
have
told
upon
the
chap
loveday
remarked
should
they
have
found
him
out
else
now
he
been
home
from
sea
this
twelvemonth
anne
then
mentioned
what
the
friendly
marine
had
told
her
and
fearing
lest
bob
was
in
the
house
and
would
be
discovered
there
when
daylight
came
they
searched
and
called
for
him
everywhere
clothes
has
he
got
on
said
the
miller
lovely
new
suit
said
his
wife
warrant
it
is
quite
spoiled
got
no
hat
said
anne
said
loveday
two
go
and
lie
down
now
and
i
bide
up
and
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
which
he
do
most
likely
in
the
course
of
the
night
i
let
him
know
that
they
are
coming
again
anne
and
loveday
went
to
their
bedrooms
and
the
miller
entered
the
mill
as
if
he
were
simply
staying
up
to
grind
but
he
continually
left
the
to
go
outside
and
walk
round
each
time
he
could
see
no
living
being
near
the
spot
anne
meanwhile
had
lain
down
dressed
upon
her
bed
the
window
still
open
her
ears
intent
upon
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
dreading
the
reappearance
of
daylight
and
the
return
three
or
four
times
during
the
night
she
descended
to
the
mill
to
inquire
of
her
stepfather
if
bob
had
shown
himself
but
the
answer
was
always
in
the
negative
at
length
the
curtains
of
her
bed
began
to
reveal
their
pattern
the
brass
handles
of
the
drawers
gleamed
forth
and
day
dawned
while
the
light
was
yet
no
more
than
a
suffusion
of
pallor
she
arose
put
on
her
hat
and
determined
to
explore
the
surrounding
premises
before
the
men
arrived
emerging
into
the
raw
loneliness
of
the
daybreak
she
went
upon
the
bridge
and
looked
up
and
down
the
road
it
was
as
she
had
left
it
empty
and
the
solitude
was
rendered
yet
more
insistent
by
the
silence
of
the
which
was
now
stopped
the
miller
having
given
up
expecting
bob
and
retired
to
bed
about
three
the
footprints
of
the
marines
still
remained
in
the
dust
on
the
bridge
all
the
towards
the
house
showing
that
the
party
had
not
as
yet
returned
while
she
lingered
she
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
other
direction
and
turning
saw
a
woman
approaching
the
woman
came
up
quickly
and
to
her
amazement
anne
recognized
matilda
her
walk
was
convulsive
face
pale
almost
haggard
and
the
cold
light
of
the
morning
invested
it
with
all
the
ghostliness
of
death
she
had
plainly
walked
all
the
way
from
budmouth
for
her
shoes
were
covered
with
dust
the
been
here
she
gasped
not
they
are
coming
have
been
got
him
i
am
too
late
they
are
coming
back
again
why
did
you
came
to
try
to
save
him
can
we
save
him
where
is
he
anne
looked
the
woman
in
the
face
and
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
she
was
in
earnest
do
know
she
answered
am
trying
to
find
him
before
they
come
you
not
let
me
help
you
cried
the
repentant
matilda
without
either
objecting
or
assenting
anne
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
back
part
of
the
homestead
matilda
too
had
suffered
that
night
from
the
moment
of
parting
with
festus
derriman
a
sentiment
of
revulsion
from
the
act
to
which
she
had
been
a
party
set
in
and
increased
till
at
length
it
reached
an
intensity
of
remorse
which
she
could
not
passively
bear
she
had
risen
before
day
and
hastened
thitherward
to
know
the
worst
and
if
possible
hinder
consequences
that
she
had
been
the
first
to
set
in
train
after
going
hither
and
thither
in
the
adjoining
field
anne
entered
the
garden
the
walks
were
bathed
in
grey
dew
and
as
she
passed
observantly
along
them
it
appeared
as
if
they
had
been
brushed
by
some
foot
at
a
much
earlier
hour
at
the
end
of
the
garden
bushes
of
broom
laurel
and
yew
formed
a
constantly
encroaching
shrubbery
that
had
come
there
almost
by
chance
and
was
never
trimmed
behind
these
bushes
was
a
and
upon
it
lay
bob
sound
asleep
the
ends
of
his
hair
were
clotted
with
damp
and
there
was
a
foggy
film
upon
the
buttons
of
his
coat
and
upon
the
buckles
of
his
shoes
his
bunch
of
new
gold
seals
was
dimmed
by
the
same
insidious
dampness
his
and
muslin
neckcloth
were
limp
as
seaweed
it
was
plain
that
he
had
been
there
a
long
time
anne
shook
him
but
he
did
not
awake
his
breathing
being
slow
and
stertorous
wake
is
your
own
anne
she
said
with
innocent
earnestness
and
then
fearfully
turning
her
head
she
saw
that
matilda
was
close
behind
her
need
mind
me
said
matilda
bitterly
am
on
your
side
now
shake
him
again
anne
shook
him
again
but
he
slept
on
then
she
noticed
that
his
forehead
bore
the
mark
of
a
heavy
wound
fancy
i
hear
something
said
her
companion
starting
forward
and
endeavouring
to
wake
bob
herself
is
stunned
or
drugged
she
said
is
no
rousing
him
anne
raised
her
head
and
listened
from
the
direction
of
the
eastern
road
came
the
sound
of
a
steady
tramp
are
coming
back
she
said
clasping
her
hands
will
take
him
ill
as
he
is
he
wo
open
his
eyes
no
it
is
no
use
o
what
shall
we
do
matilda
did
not
reply
but
running
to
the
end
of
the
seat
on
which
bob
lay
tried
its
weight
in
her
arms
is
not
too
heavy
she
said
take
that
end
and
i
take
this
we
carry
him
away
to
some
place
of
hiding
anne
instantly
seized
the
other
end
and
they
proceeded
with
their
burden
at
a
slow
pace
to
the
lower
which
they
reached
as
the
tread
of
the
resounded
over
the
bridge
that
gave
access
to
the
mill
court
now
hidden
from
view
by
the
hedge
and
the
trees
of
the
garden
will
go
down
inside
this
field
said
anne
faintly
said
the
other
will
see
our
in
the
dew
we
must
go
into
the
road
is
the
very
road
they
will
come
down
when
they
leave
the
mill
can
not
be
helped
it
is
neck
or
nothing
with
us
now
so
they
emerged
upon
the
road
and
staggered
along
without
speaking
occasionally
resting
for
a
moment
to
ease
their
arms
then
shaking
him
to
arouse
him
and
finding
it
useless
seizing
the
seat
again
when
they
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
matilda
betrayed
signs
of
exhaustion
and
she
asked
there
no
shelter
near
we
get
to
that
little
field
of
corn
said
anne
is
so
very
far
surely
there
is
some
place
near
she
pointed
to
a
few
scrubby
bushes
overhanging
a
little
stream
which
passed
under
the
road
near
this
point
are
not
thick
enough
said
anne
us
take
him
under
the
bridge
said
matilda
can
go
no
further
entering
the
opening
by
which
cattle
descended
to
drink
they
waded
into
the
weedy
water
which
here
rose
a
few
inches
above
their
ankles
to
ascend
the
stream
stoop
under
the
arch
and
reach
the
centre
of
the
roadway
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
they
look
under
the
arch
we
are
lost
murmured
anne
is
no
parapet
to
the
bridge
and
they
may
pass
over
without
heeding
they
waited
their
heads
almost
in
contact
with
the
reeking
arch
and
their
feet
encircled
by
the
stream
which
was
at
its
summer
lowness
now
for
some
minutes
they
could
hear
nothing
but
the
babble
of
the
water
over
their
ankles
and
round
the
legs
of
the
seat
on
which
bob
slumbered
the
sounds
being
reflected
in
a
musical
tinkle
from
the
hollow
sides
of
the
arch
anne
anxiety
now
was
lest
he
should
not
continue
sleeping
till
the
search
was
over
but
start
up
with
his
habitual
imprudence
and
scorning
such
means
of
safety
rush
out
into
their
arms
a
quarter
of
an
hour
dragged
by
and
then
indications
reached
their
ears
that
the
of
the
mill
had
begun
and
ended
the
tramp
drew
nearer
and
reverberated
through
the
ground
over
their
heads
where
its
volume
signified
to
the
listeners
that
the
party
had
been
largely
augmented
by
pressed
men
since
the
night
preceding
the
gang
passed
the
arch
and
the
noise
regularly
diminished
as
if
no
man
among
them
had
thought
of
looking
aside
for
a
moment
matilda
broke
the
silence
wonder
if
they
have
left
a
watch
behind
she
said
doubtfully
will
go
and
see
said
anne
till
i
return
i
can
do
no
more
when
you
come
back
i
shall
be
gone
i
ask
one
thing
of
you
if
all
goes
well
with
you
and
him
and
he
marries
you
do
be
alarmed
my
plans
lie
elsewhere
when
you
are
his
wife
tell
him
who
helped
to
carry
him
away
but
do
mention
my
name
to
the
rest
of
your
family
either
now
or
at
any
time
anne
regarded
the
speaker
for
a
moment
and
promised
after
which
she
waded
out
from
the
archway
matilda
stood
looking
at
bob
for
a
moment
as
if
preparing
to
go
till
moved
by
some
impulse
she
bent
and
lightly
kissed
him
once
can
you
cried
anne
reproachfully
when
leaving
the
mouth
of
the
arch
she
had
bent
back
and
seen
the
act
matilda
flushed
jealous
baby
she
said
scornfully
anne
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
went
out
from
the
water
and
hastened
towards
the
mill
she
entered
by
the
garden
and
seeing
no
one
advanced
and
peeped
in
at
the
window
her
mother
and
loveday
were
sitting
within
as
usual
they
all
gone
said
anne
softly
they
did
not
trouble
us
much
beyond
going
into
every
room
and
searching
about
the
garden
where
they
saw
steps
they
have
been
lucky
they
have
caught
fifteen
or
twenty
men
at
places
further
on
so
the
loss
of
bob
was
no
hurt
to
their
feelings
i
wonder
where
in
the
world
the
poor
fellow
is
will
show
you
said
anne
and
explaining
in
a
few
words
what
had
happened
she
was
promptly
followed
by
david
and
loveday
along
the
road
she
lifted
her
dress
and
entered
the
arch
with
some
anxiety
on
account
of
matilda
but
the
actress
was
gone
and
bob
lay
on
the
seat
as
she
had
left
him
bob
was
brought
out
and
water
thrown
upon
his
face
but
though
he
moved
he
did
not
rouse
himself
until
some
time
after
he
had
been
borne
into
the
house
here
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
them
standing
round
and
gathered
a
little
consciousness
are
all
right
my
boy
said
his
father
hev
happened
to
ye
where
did
ye
get
that
terrible
blow
i
can
mind
now
murmured
bob
with
a
stupefied
gaze
around
fell
in
slipping
down
the
topsail
halyard
the
rope
that
is
was
too
short
and
i
fell
upon
my
head
and
then
i
went
away
when
i
came
back
i
thought
i
would
disturb
ye
so
i
lay
down
out
there
to
sleep
out
the
watch
but
the
pain
in
my
head
was
so
great
that
i
could
get
to
sleep
so
i
picked
some
of
the
in
the
border
which
i
once
heard
was
a
good
thing
for
sending
folks
to
sleep
when
they
are
in
pain
so
i
munched
up
all
i
could
find
and
dropped
off
quite
nicely
wondered
who
had
picked
said
molly
noticed
they
were
gone
you
might
never
have
woke
again
said
loveday
holding
up
her
hands
is
your
head
now
hardly
know
replied
the
young
man
putting
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
beginning
to
doze
again
be
those
fellows
that
boarded
us
with
this
smooth
water
and
fine
breeze
we
ought
to
get
away
from
haul
in
the
larboard
braces
and
bring
her
to
the
wind
are
at
home
dear
bob
said
anne
bending
over
him
the
men
are
gone
along
upstairs
th
beest
hardly
awake
now
said
his
father
and
bob
was
assisted
to
bed
xxxiii
a
discovery
turns
the
scale
in
hours
bob
had
recovered
but
though
physically
himself
again
he
was
not
at
all
sure
of
his
position
as
a
patriot
he
had
that
practical
knowledge
of
seamanship
of
which
the
country
stood
much
in
need
and
it
was
humiliating
to
find
that
impressment
seemed
to
be
necessary
to
teach
him
to
use
it
for
her
advantage
many
neighbouring
young
men
less
fortunate
than
himself
had
been
pressed
and
taken
and
their
absence
seemed
a
reproach
to
him
he
went
away
by
himself
into
the
and
surrounded
by
the
gave
vent
to
i
am
no
man
to
lie
here
so
long
for
the
pleasure
of
sighting
that
young
girl
forty
times
a
day
and
letting
her
sight
me
bless
her
eyes
till
i
must
needs
want
a
to
teach
me
what
i
forgot
and
is
it
then
all
over
with
me
as
a
british
sailor
we
see
when
he
was
thrown
under
the
influence
of
anne
eyes
again
which
were
more
tantalizingly
beautiful
than
ever
just
now
so
it
seemed
to
him
his
intention
of
offering
his
services
to
the
government
would
wax
weaker
and
he
would
put
off
his
final
decision
till
the
next
day
anne
saw
these
fluctuations
of
his
mind
between
love
and
patriotism
and
being
terrified
by
what
she
had
heard
of
used
the
utmost
art
of
which
she
was
capable
to
seduce
him
from
his
forming
purpose
she
came
to
him
in
the
mill
wearing
the
very
prettiest
of
her
morning
jackets
the
one
that
only
just
passed
the
waist
and
was
laced
so
tastefully
round
the
collar
and
bosom
then
she
would
appear
in
her
new
hat
with
a
bouquet
of
primroses
on
one
side
and
on
the
following
sunday
she
walked
before
him
in
boots
so
that
her
feet
looked
like
a
pair
of
flitting
under
her
dress
but
dress
was
the
least
of
the
means
she
adopted
for
chaining
him
down
she
talked
more
tenderly
than
ever
asked
him
to
begin
small
undertakings
in
the
garden
on
her
account
she
sang
about
the
house
that
the
place
might
seem
cheerful
when
he
came
in
this
singing
for
a
purpose
required
great
effort
on
her
part
leaving
her
afterwards
very
sad
when
bob
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
would
say
only
i
am
thinking
how
you
will
grieve
your
father
and
cross
his
purposes
if
you
carry
out
your
unkind
notion
of
going
to
sea
and
forsaking
your
place
in
the
mill
bob
would
say
uneasily
will
trouble
him
i
know
being
also
quite
aware
how
it
would
trouble
her
he
would
again
postpone
and
thus
another
week
passed
away
all
this
time
john
had
not
come
once
to
the
mill
it
appeared
as
if
miss
johnson
absorbed
all
his
time
and
thoughts
bob
was
often
seen
chuckling
over
the
circumstance
sly
rascal
he
said
on
the
day
she
came
to
be
married
that
she
was
not
good
enough
for
me
when
it
was
only
that
he
wanted
her
for
himself
how
he
could
have
persuaded
her
to
go
away
is
beyond
me
to
say
anne
could
not
contest
this
belief
of
her
lover
and
remained
silent
but
there
had
more
than
once
occurred
to
her
mind
a
doubt
of
its
probability
yet
she
had
only
abandoned
her
opinion
that
john
had
schemed
for
matilda
to
embrace
the
opposite
error
that
finding
he
had
wronged
the
young
lady
he
had
pitied
and
grown
to
love
her
yet
jack
when
he
was
a
boy
was
the
simplest
fellow
alive
resumed
bob
george
though
i
should
have
been
hot
against
him
for
such
a
trick
if
in
losing
her
i
had
found
a
better
but
she
never
come
down
to
him
in
the
world
she
has
high
notions
now
i
am
afraid
doomed
to
sigh
in
vain
though
bob
regretted
this
possibility
the
feeling
was
not
reciprocated
by
anne
it
was
true
that
she
knew
nothing
of
matilda
temporary
treachery
and
that
she
disbelieved
the
story
of
her
lack
of
virtue
but
she
did
not
like
the
woman
it
will
not
matter
if
he
is
doomed
to
sigh
in
vain
she
said
i
owe
him
no
i
have
profited
by
his
doings
incomprehensible
as
they
are
and
she
bent
her
fair
eyes
on
bob
and
smiled
bob
looked
dubious
thinks
he
has
affronted
me
now
i
have
seen
through
him
and
that
i
shall
be
against
meeting
him
but
of
course
i
am
not
so
touchy
i
can
stand
a
practical
joke
as
can
any
man
who
has
been
afloat
i
call
and
see
him
and
tell
him
so
before
he
started
bob
bethought
him
of
something
which
would
still
further
prove
to
the
misapprehending
john
that
he
was
entirely
forgiven
he
went
to
his
room
and
took
from
his
chest
a
packet
containing
a
lock
of
miss
johnson
hair
which
she
had
given
him
during
their
brief
acquaintance
and
which
till
now
he
had
quite
forgotten
when
at
starting
he
wished
anne
goodbye
it
was
accompanied
by
such
a
beaming
face
that
she
knew
he
was
full
of
an
idea
and
asked
what
it
might
be
that
pleased
him
so
this
he
said
smacking
his
lock
of
hair
that
matilda
gave
me
anne
sank
back
with
parted
lips
am
going
to
give
it
to
jack
he
jump
for
joy
to
get
it
and
it
will
show
him
how
willing
i
am
to
give
her
up
to
him
fine
piece
as
she
is
you
see
her
bob
anne
asked
with
an
uncertain
smile
no
unless
it
is
by
accident
on
reaching
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
went
straight
to
the
barracks
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
john
in
his
room
at
the
corner
of
the
quadrangle
john
was
glad
to
see
him
but
to
bob
surprise
he
showed
no
immediate
contrition
and
thus
afforded
no
room
for
the
brotherly
speech
of
forgiveness
which
bob
had
been
going
to
deliver
as
the
did
not
open
the
subject
bob
felt
it
desirable
to
begin
himself
have
brought
ye
something
that
you
will
value
jack
he
said
as
they
sat
at
the
window
overlooking
the
large
square
have
got
no
further
use
for
it
and
you
should
have
had
it
before
if
it
had
entered
my
head
you
bob
what
is
it
said
john
looking
absently
at
an
awkward
squad
of
young
men
who
were
drilling
in
the
enclosure
a
young
woman
lock
of
hair
said
john
quite
recovering
from
his
abstraction
and
slightly
flushing
could
bob
and
anne
have
quarrelled
bob
drew
the
paper
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
said
john
black
enough
matilda
matilda
did
you
think
then
instead
of
replying
the
face
became
as
red
as
sunset
and
he
turned
to
the
window
to
hide
his
confusion
bob
was
silent
and
then
he
too
looked
into
the
court
at
length
he
arose
walked
to
his
brother
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
he
said
in
an
altered
voice
are
a
good
fellow
now
i
see
it
all
no
that
nothing
said
john
hastily
been
pretending
that
you
care
for
this
woman
that
i
blame
myself
for
heaving
you
out
from
the
other
which
is
what
i
done
without
knowing
it
does
it
matter
it
does
matter
i
been
making
you
unhappy
all
these
weeks
and
weeks
through
my
thoughtlessness
they
seemed
to
think
at
home
you
know
john
that
you
had
grown
not
to
care
for
her
or
i
would
have
done
it
for
all
the
world
stick
to
her
bob
and
never
mind
me
she
belongs
to
you
she
loves
you
i
have
no
claim
upon
her
and
she
thinks
nothing
about
me
likes
you
john
thoroughly
well
so
does
everybody
and
if
i
come
home
putting
my
foot
in
it
that
coming
home
of
mine
has
been
a
regular
blight
upon
the
family
i
ought
never
to
have
stayed
the
sea
is
my
home
and
why
could
i
bide
there
the
drew
bob
discourse
off
the
subject
as
soon
as
he
could
and
bob
after
some
unconsidered
replies
and
remarks
seemed
willing
to
avoid
it
for
the
present
he
did
not
ask
john
to
accompany
him
home
as
he
had
intended
and
on
leaving
the
barracks
turned
southward
and
entered
the
town
to
wander
about
till
he
could
decide
what
to
do
it
was
the
of
september
but
the
king
still
retained
its
summer
aspect
the
royal
had
been
drawn
out
just
as
bob
reached
gloucester
buildings
and
he
waited
a
minute
in
the
lack
of
other
distraction
to
look
on
immediately
that
the
king
machine
had
entered
the
water
a
group
of
florid
men
with
fiddles
violoncellos
a
trombone
and
a
drum
came
forward
packed
themselves
into
another
machine
that
was
in
waiting
and
were
drawn
out
into
the
waves
in
the
king
rear
all
that
was
to
be
heard
for
a
few
minutes
were
the
slow
pulsations
of
the
sea
and
then
a
deafening
noise
burst
from
the
interior
of
the
second
machine
with
power
enough
to
split
the
boards
asunder
it
was
the
condensed
mass
of
musicians
inside
striking
up
the
strains
of
save
the
king
as
his
majesty
head
rose
from
the
water
bob
took
off
his
hat
and
waited
till
the
end
of
the
performance
which
intended
as
a
pleasant
surprise
to
george
iii
by
the
loyal
burghers
was
possibly
in
the
watery
circumstances
tolerated
rather
than
desired
by
that
dripping
monarch
loveday
then
passed
on
to
the
harbour
where
he
remained
awhile
looking
at
the
busy
scene
of
loading
and
unloading
craft
and
swabbing
the
decks
of
yachts
at
the
boats
and
barges
rubbing
against
the
quay
wall
and
at
the
houses
of
the
merchants
some
ancient
structures
of
solid
stone
others
with
heavy
wooden
which
appeared
as
if
about
to
drop
into
the
harbour
by
their
own
weight
all
these
things
he
gazed
upon
and
thought
of
one
thing
that
he
had
caused
great
misery
to
his
brother
john
the
town
clock
struck
and
bob
retraced
his
steps
till
he
again
approached
the
esplanade
and
gloucester
lodge
where
the
morning
sun
blazed
in
upon
the
house
fronts
and
not
a
spot
of
shade
seemed
to
be
attainable
a
huzzaing
attracted
his
attention
and
he
observed
that
a
number
of
people
had
gathered
before
the
king
residence
where
a
brown
curricle
had
stopped
out
of
which
stepped
a
hale
man
in
the
prime
of
life
wearing
a
blue
uniform
gilt
epaulettes
cocked
hat
and
sword
who
crossed
the
pavement
and
went
in
bob
went
up
and
joined
the
group
going
on
he
said
hardy
replied
a
bystander
of
him
gone
in
waiting
to
see
the
king
the
captain
is
in
the
west
indies
the
fleet
is
come
home
they
ca
find
the
french
anywhere
they
go
and
look
for
them
again
asked
bob
yes
nelson
is
determined
to
find
as
soon
as
he
refitted
he
put
to
sea
again
ah
here
the
king
coming
in
bob
was
so
interested
in
what
he
had
just
heard
that
he
scarcely
noticed
the
arrival
of
the
king
and
a
body
of
attendant
gentlemen
he
went
on
thinking
of
his
new
knowledge
captain
hardy
was
come
he
was
doubtless
staying
with
his
family
at
their
small
at
a
few
miles
from
overcombe
where
he
usually
spent
the
intervals
between
his
different
cruises
loveday
returned
to
the
mill
without
further
delay
and
shortly
explaining
that
john
was
very
well
and
would
come
soon
went
on
to
talk
of
the
arrival
of
nelson
captain
is
he
come
at
last
said
the
miller
throwing
his
thoughts
years
backward
can
i
mind
when
he
first
left
home
to
go
on
board
the
helena
as
midshipman
not
much
to
remember
i
can
remember
it
too
said
loveday
more
than
twenty
years
ago
anyhow
and
more
than
that
i
can
mind
when
he
was
born
i
was
a
lad
serving
my
at
the
time
he
has
been
in
this
house
often
and
often
when
was
young
when
he
came
home
after
his
first
voyage
he
stayed
about
here
a
long
time
and
used
to
look
in
at
the
mill
whenever
he
went
past
what
will
you
be
next
sir
said
mother
to
him
one
day
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
doorpost
a
lieutenant
dame
loveday
says
he
and
what
next
says
she
a
commander
and
next
next
and
then
then
it
will
be
almost
time
to
die
i
warrant
that
he
mind
it
to
this
very
day
if
you
were
to
ask
him
bob
heard
all
this
with
a
manner
of
preoccupation
and
soon
retired
to
the
mill
thence
he
went
to
his
room
by
the
back
passage
and
taking
his
old
seafaring
garments
from
a
dark
closet
in
the
wall
conveyed
them
to
the
loft
at
the
top
of
the
mill
where
he
occupied
the
remaining
spare
moments
of
the
day
in
brushing
the
mildew
from
their
folds
and
hanging
each
article
by
the
window
to
get
aired
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
the
loft
and
dressing
himself
in
the
old
salt
suit
went
out
of
the
house
unobserved
by
anybody
and
ascended
the
road
towards
captain
hardy
native
village
and
present
temporary
home
the
shadeless
downs
were
now
brown
with
the
droughts
of
the
passing
summer
and
few
living
things
met
his
view
the
natural
rotundity
of
the
elevation
being
only
occasionally
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
a
barrow
a
or
a
piece
of
dry
wall
which
remained
from
some
attempted
enclosure
by
the
time
that
he
reached
the
village
it
was
dark
and
the
larger
stars
had
begun
to
shine
when
he
walked
up
to
the
door
of
the
fashioned
house
which
was
the
family
residence
of
this
branch
of
the
hardys
the
captain
allow
me
to
wait
on
him
inquired
loveday
explaining
who
and
what
he
was
the
servant
went
away
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
told
bob
that
he
might
see
the
captain
in
the
morning
that
the
case
i
come
again
replied
bob
quite
cheerful
that
failure
was
not
absolute
he
had
left
the
door
but
a
few
steps
when
he
was
called
back
and
asked
if
he
had
walked
all
the
way
from
overcombe
mill
on
purpose
loveday
replied
modestly
that
he
had
done
so
will
you
come
in
he
followed
the
speaker
into
a
small
study
or
office
and
in
a
minute
or
two
captain
hardy
entered
the
captain
at
this
time
was
a
bachelor
of
rather
stout
in
build
with
light
eyes
bushy
eyebrows
a
square
broad
face
plenty
of
chin
and
a
mouth
whose
corners
played
between
humour
and
grimness
he
surveyed
loveday
from
top
to
toe
loveday
sir
son
of
the
miller
at
overcombe
said
bob
making
a
low
bow
i
remember
your
father
loveday
the
gallant
seaman
replied
what
do
you
want
to
say
to
me
seeing
that
bob
found
it
rather
difficult
to
begin
he
leant
leisurely
against
the
mantelpiece
and
went
on
your
father
well
and
hearty
i
have
not
seen
him
for
many
many
years
well
thank
used
to
have
a
brother
in
the
army
i
think
what
was
his
name
john
a
very
fine
fellow
if
i
recollect
he
there
still
you
are
in
the
first
mate
of
the
brig
pewit
is
it
you
not
on
board
a
sir
that
the
thing
i
come
about
said
bob
recovering
confidence
should
have
been
but
is
womankind
has
hampered
me
i
waited
and
waited
on
at
home
because
of
a
young
woman
lady
i
might
have
said
for
she
sprung
from
a
higher
class
of
society
than
i
her
father
was
a
landscape
painter
maybe
you
heard
of
him
sir
the
name
is
garland
painted
that
view
of
our
village
here
said
captain
hardy
looking
towards
a
dark
little
picture
in
the
corner
of
the
room
bob
looked
and
went
on
as
if
to
the
picture
sir
i
have
found
that
however
the
came
a
week
or
two
ago
and
did
get
hold
of
me
i
did
care
to
go
aboard
as
a
pressed
man
has
been
a
severe
impressment
it
is
of
course
a
disagreeable
necessity
but
it
ca
be
helped
then
sir
something
has
happened
that
makes
me
wish
they
had
found
me
and
i
have
come
to
ask
if
i
could
enter
on
board
your
ship
the
victory
the
captain
shook
his
head
severely
and
presently
observed
am
glad
to
find
that
you
think
of
entering
the
service
loveday
smart
men
are
badly
wanted
but
it
will
not
be
in
your
power
to
choose
your
ship
well
sir
then
i
must
take
my
chance
elsewhere
said
bob
his
face
indicating
the
disappointment
he
would
not
fully
express
only
that
i
felt
i
would
much
rather
serve
under
you
than
anybody
else
my
father
and
all
of
us
being
known
to
ye
captain
hardy
and
our
families
belonging
to
the
same
parts
captain
hardy
took
bob
altitude
more
carefully
you
a
good
practical
seaman
he
asked
musingly
sir
i
believe
i
am
fond
of
skylarking
i
do
know
about
the
last
i
think
i
can
say
i
am
active
enough
i
could
walk
the
if
required
cross
from
mast
to
mast
by
the
stays
and
do
what
most
fellows
do
who
call
themselves
spry
the
captain
then
put
some
questions
about
the
details
of
navigation
which
loveday
having
luckily
been
used
to
square
rigs
answered
satisfactorily
to
reefing
topsails
he
added
i
do
do
it
like
a
flash
of
lightning
i
can
do
it
so
that
they
will
stand
blowing
weather
the
pewit
was
not
a
dull
vessel
and
when
we
were
convoyed
home
from
lisbon
she
could
keep
well
in
sight
of
the
frigate
scudding
at
a
distance
by
putting
on
full
sail
we
had
enough
hands
aboard
to
reef
topsails
fashion
which
is
a
rare
thing
in
these
days
sir
now
that
able
seamen
are
so
scarce
on
trading
craft
and
i
hear
that
men
from
vessels
are
liked
much
the
best
in
the
navy
as
being
more
ready
for
use
so
that
i
should
be
altogether
so
raw
said
bob
earnestly
i
could
enter
on
your
ship
sir
still
if
i
ca
i
ca
might
ask
for
you
loveday
said
the
captain
thoughtfully
so
get
you
there
that
way
in
short
i
think
i
may
say
i
will
ask
for
you
so
consider
it
settled
thanks
to
you
sir
said
loveday
are
aware
that
the
victory
is
a
smart
ship
and
that
cleanliness
and
order
are
of
necessity
more
strictly
insisted
upon
there
than
in
some
others
i
quite
see
it
i
hope
you
will
do
your
duty
as
well
on
a
ship
as
you
did
when
mate
of
the
brig
for
it
is
a
duty
that
may
be
serious
bob
replied
that
it
should
be
his
one
endeavour
and
receiving
a
few
instructions
for
getting
on
board
the
and
being
conveyed
to
portsmouth
he
turned
to
go
away
have
a
stiff
walk
before
you
fetch
overcombe
mill
this
dark
night
loveday
concluded
the
captain
peering
out
of
the
window
send
you
in
a
glass
of
grog
to
help
on
your
way
the
captain
then
left
bob
to
himself
and
when
he
had
drunk
the
grog
that
was
brought
in
he
started
homeward
with
a
heart
not
exactly
light
but
large
with
a
patriotic
cheerfulness
which
had
not
diminished
when
after
walking
so
fast
in
his
excitement
as
to
be
beaded
with
perspiration
he
entered
his
father
door
they
were
all
sitting
up
for
him
and
at
his
approach
anxiously
raised
their
sleepy
eyes
for
it
was
nearly
eleven
i
knew
he
not
be
much
longer
cried
anne
jumping
up
and
laughing
in
her
relief
have
been
thinking
you
were
very
strange
and
silent
bob
you
were
not
were
you
the
matter
bob
said
the
miller
for
bob
countenance
was
sublimed
by
his
recent
interview
like
that
of
a
priest
just
come
from
the
penetralia
of
the
temple
in
his
mate
clothes
just
as
when
he
came
home
observed
loveday
they
all
saw
now
that
he
had
something
to
tell
am
going
away
he
said
when
he
had
sat
down
am
going
to
enter
on
board
a
and
perhaps
it
will
be
the
victory
said
anne
faintly
do
you
mind
it
there
a
dear
he
went
on
solemnly
taking
her
hand
in
his
own
you
father
do
you
begin
to
take
it
to
the
miller
was
looking
grave
has
been
here
and
though
i
showed
them
that
i
was
a
free
man
i
am
going
to
show
everybody
that
i
can
do
my
duty
neither
of
the
other
three
answered
anne
and
the
miller
having
their
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
and
the
former
trying
to
repress
her
tears
do
you
grieve
either
of
you
he
continued
vex
yourselves
that
this
has
happened
please
not
to
be
angry
with
me
father
for
deserting
you
and
the
mill
where
you
want
me
for
i
for
these
three
years
we
and
the
rest
of
the
country
have
been
in
fear
of
the
enemy
trade
has
been
hindered
poor
folk
made
hungry
and
many
rich
folk
made
poor
there
must
be
a
deliverance
and
it
must
be
done
by
sea
i
have
seen
captain
hardy
and
i
shall
serve
under
him
if
so
be
i
can
hardy
i
have
been
to
his
house
at
where
he
staying
with
his
sisters
walked
there
and
back
and
i
would
have
missed
it
for
fifty
guineas
i
hardly
thought
he
would
see
me
but
he
did
see
me
and
he
has
forgot
you
bob
then
opened
his
tale
in
order
relating
graphically
the
conversation
to
which
he
had
been
a
party
and
they
listened
with
breathless
attention
if
you
must
go
you
must
said
the
miller
with
emotion
i
think
it
somewhat
hard
that
of
my
two
sons
neither
one
of
can
be
got
to
stay
and
help
me
in
my
business
as
i
get
old
trouble
and
vex
about
it
said
loveday
soothingly
are
both
instruments
in
the
hands
of
providence
chosen
to
chastise
that
corsican
ogre
and
do
what
they
can
for
the
country
in
these
trying
years
just
the
shape
of
it
loveday
said
bob
he
come
back
soon
she
continued
turning
to
anne
then
he
tell
us
all
he
has
seen
and
the
glory
that
he
won
and
how
he
has
helped
to
sweep
that
scourge
buonaparty
off
the
earth
be
you
going
bob
his
father
inquired
if
i
can
i
shall
call
at
the
barracks
and
tell
john
as
i
go
by
when
i
get
to
portsmouth
a
burst
of
sobs
in
quick
succession
interrupted
his
words
they
came
from
anne
who
till
that
moment
had
been
sitting
as
before
with
her
hand
in
that
of
bob
and
apparently
quite
calm
loveday
jumped
up
but
before
she
could
say
anything
to
soothe
the
agitated
girl
she
had
calmed
herself
with
the
same
singular
suddenness
that
had
marked
her
giving
way
do
mind
bob
going
she
said
think
he
ought
to
go
suppose
bob
that
i
want
you
to
stay
after
this
she
left
the
apartment
and
went
into
the
little
side
room
where
she
and
her
mother
usually
worked
in
a
few
moments
bob
followed
her
when
he
came
back
he
was
in
a
very
sad
and
emotional
mood
anybody
could
see
that
there
had
been
a
parting
of
profound
anguish
to
both
is
not
coming
back
he
said
will
see
her
before
you
go
said
her
mother
may
or
i
may
not
he
replied
and
loveday
do
you
go
to
bed
now
i
have
got
to
look
over
my
things
and
get
ready
and
it
will
take
me
some
little
time
if
you
should
hear
noises
you
will
know
it
is
only
myself
moving
about
when
bob
was
left
alone
he
suddenly
became
brisk
and
set
himself
to
overhaul
his
clothes
and
other
possessions
in
a
manner
by
the
time
that
his
chest
was
packed
such
things
as
he
meant
to
leave
at
home
folded
into
cupboards
and
what
was
useless
destroyed
it
was
past
two
then
he
went
to
bed
so
softly
that
only
the
creak
of
one
weak
stair
revealed
his
passage
upward
at
the
moment
that
he
passed
anne
her
mother
was
bending
over
her
as
she
lay
in
bed
and
saying
to
her
you
see
him
in
the
morning
no
said
anne
would
rather
not
see
him
i
have
said
that
i
may
but
i
shall
not
i
can
not
see
him
again
when
the
family
got
up
next
day
bob
had
vanished
it
was
his
way
to
disappear
like
this
to
avoid
affecting
scenes
at
parting
by
the
time
that
they
had
sat
down
to
a
gloomy
breakfast
bob
was
in
the
boat
of
a
budmouth
waterman
who
pulled
him
alongside
the
guardship
in
the
roads
where
he
laid
hold
of
the
mounted
and
disappeared
from
external
view
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
ship
moved
off
set
her
royals
and
made
sail
for
portsmouth
with
five
hundred
new
hands
for
the
service
on
board
consisting
partly
of
pressed
men
and
partly
of
volunteers
among
the
latter
being
robert
loveday
xxxiv
a
speck
on
the
sea
in
parting
from
john
who
accompanied
him
to
the
quay
bob
had
said
jack
these
be
my
last
words
to
you
i
give
her
up
i
go
away
on
purpose
and
i
shall
be
away
a
long
time
if
in
that
time
she
should
list
over
towards
ye
ever
so
little
mind
you
take
her
you
have
more
right
to
her
than
i
you
chose
her
when
my
mind
was
elsewhere
and
you
best
deserve
her
for
i
have
never
known
you
forget
one
woman
while
forgot
a
dozen
take
her
then
if
she
will
come
and
god
bless
both
of
ye
another
person
besides
john
saw
bob
go
that
was
derriman
who
was
standing
by
a
bollard
a
little
further
up
the
quay
he
did
not
repress
his
satisfaction
at
the
sight
john
looked
towards
him
with
an
open
gaze
of
contempt
for
the
cuffs
administered
to
the
yeoman
at
the
inn
had
not
so
far
as
the
was
aware
produced
any
desire
to
avenge
that
insult
john
being
of
course
quite
ignorant
that
festus
had
erroneously
retaliated
upon
bob
in
his
peculiar
though
scarcely
soldierly
way
finding
that
he
did
not
even
now
approach
him
john
went
on
his
way
and
thought
over
his
intention
of
preserving
intact
the
love
between
anne
and
his
brother
he
was
surprised
when
he
next
went
to
the
mill
to
find
how
glad
they
all
were
to
see
him
from
the
moment
of
bob
return
to
the
bosom
of
the
deep
anne
had
had
no
existence
on
land
people
might
have
looked
at
her
human
body
and
said
she
had
flitted
thence
the
sea
and
all
that
belonged
to
the
sea
was
her
daily
thought
and
her
nightly
dream
she
had
the
whole
winds
under
her
eye
each
passing
gale
that
ushered
in
returning
autumn
being
mentally
registered
and
she
acquired
a
precise
knowledge
of
the
direction
in
which
portsmouth
brest
ferrol
cadiz
and
other
such
likely
places
lay
instead
of
saying
her
own
familiar
prayers
at
night
she
substituted
with
some
confusion
of
thought
the
forms
of
prayer
to
be
used
at
sea
john
at
once
noticed
her
lorn
abstracted
looks
pitied
her
how
much
he
pitied
her
and
asked
when
they
were
alone
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
are
two
things
she
said
with
almost
childish
eagerness
in
her
tired
eyes
shall
be
done
first
is
to
find
out
if
captain
hardy
has
gone
back
to
his
ship
and
the
other
is
o
if
you
will
do
it
john
to
get
me
newspapers
whenever
possible
after
this
duologue
john
was
absent
for
a
space
of
three
hours
and
they
thought
he
had
gone
back
to
barracks
he
entered
however
at
the
end
of
that
time
took
off
his
and
wiped
his
forehead
look
tired
john
said
his
father
no
he
went
through
the
house
till
he
had
found
anne
garland
have
only
done
one
of
those
things
he
said
to
her
already
i
did
hope
for
or
mean
hardy
is
gone
from
he
left
some
days
ago
we
shall
soon
hear
that
the
fleet
has
sailed
have
been
all
the
way
to
on
purpose
how
good
of
you
i
was
anxious
to
know
myself
when
bob
is
likely
to
leave
i
expect
now
that
we
shall
soon
hear
from
him
two
days
later
he
came
again
he
brought
a
newspaper
and
what
was
better
a
letter
for
anne
franked
by
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
victory
he
aboard
her
said
anne
as
she
eagerly
took
the
letter
it
was
short
but
as
much
as
she
could
expect
in
the
circumstances
and
informed
them
that
the
captain
had
been
as
good
as
his
word
and
had
gratified
bob
earnest
wish
to
serve
under
him
the
ship
with
admiral
lord
nelson
on
board
and
accompanied
by
the
frigate
euryalus
was
to
sail
in
two
days
for
plymouth
where
they
would
be
joined
by
others
and
thence
proceed
to
the
coast
of
spain
anne
lay
awake
that
night
thinking
of
the
victory
and
of
those
who
floated
in
her
to
the
best
of
anne
calculation
that
ship
of
war
would
during
the
next
hours
pass
within
a
few
miles
of
where
she
herself
then
lay
next
to
seeing
bob
the
thing
that
would
give
her
more
pleasure
than
any
other
in
the
world
was
to
see
the
vessel
that
contained
him
his
floating
city
his
sole
dependence
in
battle
and
storm
upon
whose
safety
from
winds
and
enemies
hung
all
her
hope
the
morrow
was
at
the
seaport
and
in
this
she
saw
her
opportunity
a
carrier
went
from
overcombe
at
six
thither
and
having
to
do
a
little
shopping
for
herself
she
gave
it
as
a
reason
for
her
intended
day
absence
and
took
a
place
in
the
van
when
she
reached
the
town
it
was
still
early
morning
but
the
borough
was
already
in
the
zenith
of
its
daily
bustle
and
show
the
king
was
always
doors
by
six
and
such
hours
at
gloucester
lodge
produced
an
equally
forward
stir
among
the
population
she
alighted
and
passed
down
the
esplanade
as
fully
thronged
by
persons
of
fashion
at
this
time
of
mist
and
level
sunlight
as
a
in
the
present
day
is
at
four
in
the
afternoon
dashing
bucks
and
beaux
in
cocked
hats
black
feathers
ruffles
and
frills
stared
at
her
as
she
hurried
along
the
beach
was
swarming
with
bathing
women
wearing
waistbands
that
bore
the
national
refrain
save
the
king
in
gilt
letters
the
shops
were
all
open
and
sergeant
stanner
with
his
and
heroic
gaze
was
beating
up
at
two
guineas
and
a
crown
the
crown
to
drink
his
majesty
health
she
soon
finished
her
shopping
and
then
crossing
over
into
the
old
town
pursued
her
way
along
the
to
portland
at
the
end
of
an
hour
she
had
been
rowed
across
the
fleet
which
then
lacked
the
convenience
of
a
bridge
and
reached
the
base
of
portland
hill
the
steep
incline
before
her
was
dotted
with
houses
showing
the
pleasant
peculiarity
of
one
man
doorstep
being
behind
his
neighbour
chimney
and
slabs
of
stone
as
the
common
material
for
walls
roof
floor
sty
and
anne
gained
the
summit
and
followed
along
the
central
track
over
the
huge
lump
of
freestone
which
forms
the
peninsula
the
wide
sea
prospect
extending
as
she
went
on
weary
with
her
journey
she
approached
the
extreme
southerly
peak
of
rock
and
gazed
from
the
cliff
at
portland
bill
or
beal
as
it
was
in
those
days
more
correctly
called
the
wild
herbless
promontory
was
quite
a
solitude
and
saving
the
one
old
lighthouse
about
fifty
yards
up
the
slope
scarce
a
mark
was
visible
to
show
that
humanity
had
ever
been
near
the
spot
anne
found
herself
a
seat
on
a
stone
and
swept
with
her
eyes
the
tremulous
expanse
of
water
around
her
that
seemed
to
utter
a
ceaseless
unintelligible
incantation
out
of
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
of
her
complete
horizon
two
hundred
and
fifty
were
covered
by
waves
the
coup
including
the
area
of
troubled
waters
known
as
the
race
where
two
seas
met
to
effect
the
destruction
of
such
vessels
as
could
not
be
mastered
by
one
she
counted
the
craft
within
her
view
there
were
five
no
there
were
only
four
no
there
were
seven
some
of
the
specks
having
resolved
themselves
into
two
they
were
all
small
coasters
and
kept
well
within
sight
of
land
anne
sank
into
a
reverie
then
she
heard
a
slight
noise
on
her
left
hand
and
turning
beheld
an
old
sailor
who
had
approached
with
a
glass
he
was
levelling
it
over
the
sea
in
a
direction
to
the
and
somewhat
removed
from
that
in
which
her
own
eyes
had
been
wandering
anne
moved
a
few
steps
thitherward
so
as
to
unclose
to
her
view
a
deeper
sweep
on
that
side
and
by
this
discovered
a
ship
of
far
larger
size
than
any
which
had
yet
dotted
the
main
before
her
its
sails
were
for
the
most
part
new
and
clean
and
in
comparison
with
its
rapid
progress
before
the
wind
the
small
brigs
and
ketches
seemed
standing
still
upon
this
striking
object
the
old
man
glass
was
bent
do
you
see
sailor
she
asked
nothing
he
answered
sight
is
so
gone
off
lately
that
things
one
and
all
be
but
a
november
mist
to
me
and
yet
i
fain
would
see
i
am
looking
for
the
victory
she
said
quickly
have
a
son
aboard
her
he
one
of
three
from
these
parts
the
captain
there
my
son
ned
and
there
young
loveday
of
overcombe
he
that
lately
joined
i
look
for
you
said
anne
after
a
pause
if
so
be
you
please
anne
took
the
glass
and
he
supported
it
by
his
arm
is
a
large
ship
she
said
three
masts
three
rows
of
guns
along
the
side
and
all
her
sails
set
guessed
as
much
is
a
little
flag
in
front
over
her
bowsprit
jack
there
a
large
one
flying
at
her
stern
ensign
a
white
one
on
her
the
admiral
flag
the
flag
of
my
lord
nelson
what
is
her
my
dear
supported
on
this
side
by
a
sailor
her
companion
nodded
with
satisfaction
the
other
side
of
that
is
a
marine
is
twisting
round
in
a
curious
way
and
her
sails
sink
in
like
old
cheeks
and
she
shivers
like
a
leaf
upon
a
tree
is
in
stays
for
the
larboard
tack
i
can
see
what
she
been
doing
she
been
close
in
to
avoid
the
flood
tide
as
the
wind
is
to
the
and
she
bound
down
but
as
soon
as
the
ebb
made
d
see
they
made
sail
to
the
captain
hardy
may
be
depended
upon
for
that
he
knows
every
current
about
here
being
a
native
now
i
can
see
the
other
side
it
is
a
soldier
where
a
sailor
was
before
you
are
it
is
the
victory
am
sure
after
this
a
frigate
came
into
view
the
euryalus
sailing
in
the
same
direction
anne
sat
down
and
her
eyes
never
left
the
ships
me
more
about
the
victory
she
said
is
the
best
sailer
in
the
service
and
she
carries
a
hundred
guns
the
heaviest
be
on
the
lower
deck
the
next
size
on
the
middle
deck
the
next
on
the
main
and
upper
decks
my
son
ned
place
is
on
the
lower
deck
because
he
short
and
they
put
the
short
men
below
bob
though
not
tall
was
not
likely
to
be
specially
selected
for
shortness
she
pictured
him
on
the
upper
deck
in
his
trousers
and
jacket
of
navy
blue
looking
perhaps
towards
the
very
point
of
land
where
she
then
was
the
great
silent
ship
with
her
population
of
marines
officers
captain
and
the
admiral
who
was
not
to
return
alive
passed
like
a
phantom
the
meridian
of
the
bill
sometimes
her
aspect
was
that
of
a
large
white
bat
sometimes
that
of
a
grey
one
in
the
course
of
time
the
watching
girl
saw
that
the
ship
had
passed
her
nearest
point
the
breadth
of
her
sails
diminished
by
foreshortening
till
she
assumed
the
form
of
an
egg
on
end
after
this
something
seemed
to
twinkle
and
anne
who
had
previously
withdrawn
from
the
old
sailor
went
back
to
him
and
looked
again
through
the
glass
the
twinkling
was
the
light
falling
upon
the
cabin
windows
of
the
ship
stern
she
explained
it
to
the
old
man
we
see
now
what
the
enemy
have
seen
but
once
that
was
in
nine
when
she
sighted
the
french
and
spanish
fleet
off
scilly
and
she
retreated
because
she
feared
a
landing
well
is
a
brave
ship
and
she
carries
brave
men
anne
tender
bosom
heaved
but
she
said
nothing
and
again
became
absorbed
in
contemplation
the
victory
was
fast
dropping
away
she
was
on
the
horizon
and
soon
appeared
hull
down
that
seemed
to
be
like
the
beginning
of
a
greater
end
than
her
present
vanishing
anne
garland
could
not
stay
by
the
sailor
any
longer
and
went
about
a
off
where
she
was
hidden
by
the
inequality
of
the
cliff
from
his
view
the
vessel
was
now
exactly
end
on
and
stood
out
in
the
direction
of
the
start
her
width
having
contracted
to
the
proportion
of
a
feather
she
sat
down
again
and
mechanically
took
out
some
biscuits
that
she
had
brought
foreseeing
that
her
waiting
might
be
long
but
she
could
not
eat
one
of
them
eating
seemed
to
jar
with
the
mental
tenseness
of
the
moment
and
her
undeviating
gaze
continued
to
follow
the
lessened
ship
with
the
fidelity
of
a
balanced
needle
to
a
magnetic
stone
all
else
in
her
being
motionless
the
courses
of
the
victory
were
absorbed
into
the
main
then
her
topsails
went
and
then
her
she
was
now
no
more
than
a
dead
wing
on
a
sheet
of
spider
web
and
even
this
fragment
diminished
anne
could
hardly
bear
to
see
the
end
and
yet
she
resolved
not
to
flinch
the
admiral
flag
sank
behind
the
watery
line
and
in
a
minute
the
very
truck
of
the
last
topmast
stole
away
the
victory
was
gone
anne
lip
quivered
as
she
murmured
without
removing
her
wet
eyes
from
the
vacant
and
solemn
horizon
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
that
do
business
in
great
waters
these
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
was
returned
by
a
man
voice
from
behind
her
looking
round
quickly
she
saw
a
soldier
standing
there
and
the
grave
eyes
of
john
loveday
bent
on
her
what
i
was
thinking
she
said
trying
to
be
composed
were
saying
it
he
answered
gently
i
i
did
not
know
it
how
came
you
here
she
presently
added
have
been
behind
you
a
good
while
but
you
never
turned
round
was
deeply
occupied
she
said
in
an
undertone
i
too
came
to
see
him
pass
i
heard
this
morning
that
lord
nelson
had
embarked
and
i
knew
at
once
that
they
would
sail
immediately
the
victory
and
euryalus
are
to
join
the
rest
of
the
fleet
at
plymouth
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
assembled
to
see
the
admiral
off
they
cheered
him
and
the
ship
as
she
dropped
down
he
took
his
coffin
on
board
with
him
they
say
coffin
said
anne
turning
deadly
pale
terrible
then
is
meant
by
that
o
why
bob
go
in
that
ship
doomed
to
destruction
from
the
very
beginning
like
this
was
his
determination
to
sail
under
captain
hardy
and
under
no
one
else
said
john
may
be
hot
work
but
we
must
hope
for
the
best
and
observing
how
wretched
she
looked
he
added
wo
you
let
me
help
you
back
if
you
can
walk
as
far
as
hope
cove
it
will
be
enough
a
lerret
is
going
from
there
across
the
bay
homeward
to
the
harbour
in
the
course
of
an
hour
it
belongs
to
a
man
i
know
and
they
can
take
one
passenger
i
am
sure
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
channel
and
by
his
help
soon
reached
the
place
indicated
the
boat
was
lying
there
as
he
had
said
she
found
it
to
belong
to
the
old
man
who
had
been
with
her
at
the
bill
and
was
in
charge
of
his
two
younger
sons
the
helped
her
into
it
over
the
slippery
blocks
of
stone
one
of
the
young
men
spread
his
jacket
for
her
to
sit
on
and
as
soon
as
they
pulled
from
shore
john
climbed
up
the
cliff
and
disappeared
over
the
top
to
return
to
the
mainland
by
road
anne
was
in
the
town
by
three
the
trip
in
the
stern
of
the
lerret
had
quite
refreshed
her
with
the
help
of
the
biscuits
which
she
had
at
last
been
able
to
eat
the
van
from
the
port
to
overcombe
did
not
start
till
four
and
feeling
no
further
interest
in
the
gaieties
of
the
place
she
strolled
on
past
the
king
house
to
the
outskirts
her
mind
settling
down
again
upon
the
possibly
sad
fate
of
the
victory
when
she
found
herself
alone
she
did
not
hurry
on
and
finding
that
even
now
there
wanted
another
to
the
carrier
time
she
turned
into
a
little
lane
to
escape
the
inspection
of
the
numerous
here
all
was
quite
lonely
and
still
and
she
sat
down
under
a
absently
regarding
the
landscape
which
had
begun
to
put
on
the
rich
tones
of
declining
summer
but
which
to
her
was
as
hollow
and
faded
as
a
theatre
by
day
she
could
hold
out
no
longer
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
she
wept
without
restraint
some
yards
behind
her
was
a
little
spring
of
water
having
a
stone
margin
round
it
to
prevent
the
cattle
from
treading
in
the
sides
and
filling
it
up
with
dirt
while
she
wept
two
elderly
gentlemen
entered
unperceived
upon
the
scene
and
walked
on
to
the
spring
brink
here
they
paused
and
looked
in
afterwards
moving
round
it
and
then
stooping
as
if
to
smell
or
taste
its
waters
the
spring
was
in
fact
a
sulphurous
one
then
recently
discovered
by
a
physician
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
and
it
was
beginning
to
attract
some
attention
having
by
common
report
contributed
to
effect
such
wonderful
cures
as
almost
passed
belief
after
a
considerable
discussion
apparently
on
how
the
pool
might
be
improved
for
better
use
one
of
the
two
elderly
gentlemen
turned
away
leaving
the
other
still
probing
the
spring
with
his
cane
the
first
stranger
who
wore
a
blue
coat
with
gilt
buttons
came
on
in
the
direction
of
anne
garland
and
seeing
her
sad
posture
went
quickly
up
to
her
and
said
abruptly
is
the
matter
anne
who
in
her
grief
had
observed
nothing
of
the
gentlemen
presence
withdrew
her
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
and
started
to
her
feet
she
instantly
recognised
her
interrogator
as
the
king
what
crying
his
majesty
inquired
kindly
is
this
have
seen
a
dear
friend
go
away
sir
she
faltered
with
downcast
eyes
partings
are
sad
very
sad
for
us
all
you
must
hope
your
friend
will
return
soon
where
is
he
or
she
gone
do
know
your
majesty
know
how
is
that
is
a
sailor
on
board
the
victory
he
has
reason
to
be
proud
said
the
king
with
interest
is
your
brother
anne
tried
to
explain
what
he
was
but
could
not
and
blushed
with
painful
heat
well
well
what
is
his
name
in
spite
of
anne
confusion
and
low
spirits
her
womanly
shrewdness
told
her
at
once
that
no
harm
could
be
done
by
revealing
bob
name
and
she
answered
name
is
robert
loveday
sir
a
good
name
i
shall
not
forget
it
now
dry
your
cheeks
and
do
cry
any
more
loveday
robert
loveday
anne
curtseyed
the
king
smiled
and
turned
to
rejoin
his
companion
who
was
afterwards
heard
to
be
the
physician
in
attendance
at
gloucester
lodge
this
gentleman
had
in
the
meantime
filled
a
small
phial
with
the
medicinal
water
which
he
carefully
placed
in
his
pocket
and
on
the
king
coming
up
they
retired
together
and
disappeared
thereupon
anne
now
thoroughly
aroused
followed
the
same
way
with
a
gingerly
tread
just
in
time
to
see
them
get
into
a
carriage
which
was
in
waiting
at
the
turning
of
the
lane
she
quite
forgot
the
carrier
and
everything
else
in
connexion
with
riding
home
flying
along
the
road
rapidly
and
unconsciously
when
she
awoke
to
a
sense
of
her
whereabouts
she
was
so
near
to
overcombe
as
to
make
the
carrier
not
worth
waiting
for
she
had
been
borne
up
in
this
hasty
spurt
at
the
end
of
a
weary
day
by
visions
of
bob
promoted
to
the
rank
of
admiral
or
something
equally
wonderful
by
the
king
special
command
the
chief
result
of
the
promotion
being
in
her
arrangement
of
the
piece
that
he
would
stay
at
home
and
go
to
sea
no
more
but
she
was
not
a
girl
who
indulged
in
extravagant
fancies
long
and
before
she
reached
home
she
thought
that
the
king
had
probably
forgotten
her
by
that
time
and
her
troubles
and
her
lover
name
xxxv
a
sailor
enters
the
remaining
fortnight
of
the
month
of
september
passed
away
with
a
general
decline
from
the
summer
excitements
the
royal
family
left
the
the
first
week
in
october
the
german
legion
with
their
artillery
about
the
same
time
the
dragoons
still
remained
at
the
barracks
just
out
of
the
town
and
john
loveday
brought
to
anne
every
newspaper
that
he
could
lay
hands
on
especially
such
as
contained
any
fragment
of
shipping
news
this
threw
them
much
together
and
at
these
times
john
was
often
awkward
and
confused
on
account
of
the
unwonted
stress
of
concealing
his
great
love
for
her
her
interests
had
grandly
developed
from
the
limits
of
overcombe
and
the
town
life
hard
by
to
an
extensiveness
truly
european
during
the
whole
month
of
october
however
not
a
single
grain
of
information
reached
her
or
anybody
else
concerning
nelson
and
his
blockading
squadron
off
cadiz
there
were
the
customary
bad
jokes
about
buonaparte
especially
when
it
was
found
that
the
whole
french
army
had
turned
its
back
upon
boulogne
and
set
out
for
the
rhine
then
came
accounts
of
his
march
through
germany
and
into
austria
but
not
a
word
about
the
victory
at
the
beginning
of
autumn
john
brought
news
which
fearfully
depressed
her
the
austrian
general
mack
had
capitulated
with
his
whole
army
then
were
revived
the
old
misgivings
as
to
invasion
of
having
to
cope
with
him
weary
with
waiting
we
shall
have
to
encounter
this
man
fresh
from
the
fields
of
victory
ran
the
newspaper
article
but
the
week
which
had
led
off
with
such
a
dreary
piping
was
to
end
in
another
key
on
the
very
day
when
mack
army
was
piling
arms
at
the
feet
of
its
conqueror
a
blow
had
been
struck
by
bob
loveday
and
his
comrades
which
eternally
shattered
the
enemy
force
by
sea
four
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
austrian
news
corporal
tullidge
ran
into
the
miller
house
to
inform
him
that
on
the
previous
monday
at
eleven
in
the
morning
the
pickle
schooner
lieutenant
lapenotiere
had
arrived
at
falmouth
with
despatches
from
the
fleet
that
the
on
the
highway
through
wessex
to
london
were
chalked
with
the
words
victory
triumph
and
so
on
and
that
all
the
country
people
were
wild
to
know
particulars
on
friday
afternoon
john
arrived
with
authentic
news
of
the
battle
off
cape
trafalgar
and
the
death
of
nelson
captain
hardy
was
alive
though
his
escape
had
been
narrow
enough
his
having
been
carried
away
by
a
shot
it
was
feared
that
the
victory
had
been
the
scene
of
the
heaviest
slaughter
among
all
the
ships
engaged
but
as
yet
no
returns
of
killed
and
wounded
had
been
issued
beyond
a
rough
list
of
the
numbers
in
some
of
the
ships
the
suspense
of
the
little
household
in
overcombe
mill
was
great
in
the
extreme
john
came
thither
daily
for
more
than
a
week
but
no
further
particulars
reached
england
till
the
end
of
that
time
and
then
only
the
meagre
intelligence
that
there
had
been
a
gale
immediately
after
the
battle
and
that
many
of
the
prizes
had
been
lost
anne
said
little
to
all
these
things
and
preserved
a
superstratum
of
calmness
on
her
countenance
but
some
inner
voice
seemed
to
whisper
to
her
that
bob
was
no
more
miller
loveday
drove
to
several
times
to
learn
if
the
captain
sisters
had
received
any
more
definite
tidings
than
these
flying
reports
but
that
family
had
heard
nothing
which
could
in
any
way
relieve
the
miller
anxiety
when
at
last
at
the
end
of
november
there
appeared
a
final
and
revised
list
of
killed
and
wounded
as
issued
by
admiral
collingwood
it
was
a
useless
sheet
to
the
lovedays
to
their
great
pain
it
contained
no
names
but
those
of
officers
the
friends
of
ordinary
seamen
and
marines
being
in
those
good
old
days
left
to
discover
their
losses
as
best
they
might
anne
conviction
of
her
loss
increased
with
the
darkening
of
the
early
winter
time
bob
was
not
a
cautious
man
who
would
avoid
needless
exposure
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
victory
crew
had
been
disabled
or
slain
anybody
who
had
looked
into
her
room
at
this
time
would
have
seen
that
her
favourite
reading
was
the
office
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
at
sea
beginning
therefore
commit
his
body
to
the
deep
in
these
first
days
of
december
several
of
the
victorious
fleet
came
into
port
but
not
the
victory
many
supposed
that
that
noble
ship
disabled
by
the
battle
had
gone
to
the
bottom
in
the
subsequent
tempestuous
weather
and
the
belief
was
persevered
in
till
it
was
told
in
the
town
and
port
that
she
had
been
seen
passing
up
the
channel
two
days
later
the
victory
arrived
at
portsmouth
then
letters
from
survivors
began
to
appear
in
the
public
prints
which
john
so
regularly
brought
to
anne
but
though
he
watched
the
mails
with
unceasing
vigilance
there
was
never
a
letter
from
bob
it
sometimes
crossed
john
mind
that
his
brother
might
still
be
alive
and
well
and
that
in
his
wish
to
abide
by
his
expressed
intention
of
giving
up
anne
and
home
life
he
was
deliberately
lax
in
writing
if
so
bob
was
carrying
out
the
idea
too
thoughtlessly
by
half
as
could
be
seen
by
watching
the
effects
of
suspense
upon
the
fair
face
of
the
victim
and
the
anxiety
of
the
rest
of
the
family
it
was
a
clear
day
in
december
the
first
slight
snow
of
the
season
had
been
sifted
over
the
earth
and
one
side
of
the
branches
in
the
miller
garden
was
touched
with
white
though
a
few
leaves
were
still
lingering
on
the
tops
of
the
younger
trees
a
short
sailor
of
the
royal
navy
who
was
not
bob
nor
anything
like
him
crossed
the
mill
court
and
came
to
the
door
the
miller
hastened
out
and
brought
him
into
the
room
where
john
loveday
and
anne
garland
were
all
present
from
aboard
the
victory
said
the
sailor
name
jim
cornick
and
your
lad
is
alive
and
well
they
breathed
rather
than
spoke
their
thankfulness
and
relief
the
miller
eyes
being
moist
as
he
turned
aside
to
calm
himself
while
anne
having
first
jumped
up
wildly
from
her
seat
sank
back
again
under
the
almost
insupportable
joy
that
trembled
through
her
limbs
to
her
utmost
finger
come
from
spithead
to
the
sailor
continued
now
i
am
going
on
to
father
at
budmouth
i
know
your
father
cried
the
james
cornick
it
was
the
man
who
had
brought
anne
in
his
lerret
from
portland
bill
bob
has
got
a
scratch
said
the
miller
a
scratch
said
cornick
loveday
then
bustled
off
to
draw
the
visitor
something
to
drink
anne
garland
with
a
glowing
blush
on
her
face
had
gone
to
the
back
part
of
the
room
where
she
was
the
very
embodiment
of
sweet
content
as
she
slightly
swayed
herself
without
speaking
a
little
tide
of
happiness
seemed
to
ebb
and
flow
through
her
in
listening
to
the
sailor
words
moving
her
figure
with
it
the
seaman
and
john
went
on
conversing
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
barricading
the
afore
we
were
in
action
and
the
and
both
were
very
much
pleased
at
how
done
when
the
went
up
the
ladder
hardy
said
a
word
or
two
to
bob
but
what
it
was
i
do
know
for
i
was
quartered
at
a
gun
some
ways
off
however
bob
saw
the
stagger
when
was
wownded
and
was
one
of
the
men
who
carried
him
to
the
cockpit
after
that
he
and
some
other
lads
jumped
aboard
the
french
ship
and
i
believe
they
was
in
her
when
she
struck
her
flag
what
did
next
i
ca
say
for
the
wind
had
dropped
and
the
smoke
was
like
a
cloud
but
got
a
good
deal
talked
about
and
they
say
promotion
in
store
at
this
point
in
the
story
jim
cornick
stopped
to
drink
and
a
low
unconscious
humming
came
from
anne
in
her
distant
corner
the
faint
melody
continued
more
or
less
when
the
conversation
between
the
sailor
and
the
lovedays
was
renewed
heard
afore
that
the
victory
was
near
knocked
to
pieces
said
the
miller
to
pieces
you
say
so
if
so
be
you
could
see
her
gad
her
sides
be
battered
like
an
old
penny
piece
the
shot
be
still
sticking
in
her
wales
and
her
sails
be
like
so
many
we
have
run
all
the
way
home
under
jury
topmasts
and
as
for
her
decks
you
may
swab
wi
hot
water
and
you
may
swab
wi
cold
but
there
the
and
there
they
bide
the
had
a
narrow
escape
like
many
o
the
rest
a
shot
shaved
his
ankle
like
a
razor
you
should
have
seen
that
man
face
in
the
het
o
battle
his
features
were
as
if
they
been
cast
in
steel
rather
expected
a
letter
from
bob
before
this
said
jim
cornick
with
a
smile
of
toleration
must
make
allowances
the
truth
is
he
engaged
just
now
at
portsmouth
like
a
good
many
of
the
rest
from
our
ship
is
a
very
nice
young
woman
that
he
a
courting
of
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
she
be
an
excellent
wife
for
him
said
loveday
in
a
warning
tone
wife
said
the
miller
they
instinctively
looked
towards
anne
anne
had
started
as
if
shaken
by
an
invisible
hand
and
a
thick
mist
of
doubt
seemed
to
obscure
the
intelligence
of
her
eyes
this
was
but
for
two
or
three
moments
very
pale
she
arose
and
went
right
up
to
the
seaman
john
gently
tried
to
intercept
her
but
she
passed
him
by
you
speak
of
robert
loveday
as
courting
a
wife
she
asked
without
the
least
betrayal
of
emotion
did
see
you
miss
replied
cornick
turning
your
brother
hev
his
eye
on
a
wife
and
he
deserves
one
i
hope
you
do
mind
in
the
least
she
said
with
a
stage
laugh
am
interested
naturally
and
what
is
she
very
nice
young
daughter
honey
a
very
wise
choice
of
the
young
man
she
fair
or
dark
hair
is
rather
light
like
light
hair
and
her
name
name
is
caroline
but
can
it
be
that
my
story
hurts
ye
if
so
yes
said
john
interposing
anxiously
do
care
for
more
just
at
this
moment
care
for
more
said
anne
vehemently
it
all
sailor
that
is
a
very
pretty
name
caroline
when
are
they
going
to
be
married
do
know
as
how
the
day
is
settled
answered
jim
even
now
scarcely
conscious
of
the
devastation
he
was
causing
in
one
fair
breast
from
the
rate
the
courting
is
scudding
along
at
i
should
say
it
wo
be
long
first
you
see
him
when
you
go
back
give
him
my
best
wishes
she
lightly
said
as
she
moved
away
she
added
with
solemn
bitterness
that
i
am
glad
to
hear
he
is
making
such
good
use
of
the
first
days
of
his
escape
from
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
she
went
away
expressing
indifference
by
audibly
singing
in
the
distance
we
go
dance
the
round
the
round
the
round
shall
we
go
dance
the
round
sister
is
lively
at
the
news
observed
jim
cornick
murmured
john
gloomily
as
he
gnawed
his
lower
lip
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
continued
the
man
from
the
victory
wo
say
that
your
brother
intended
got
some
ballast
which
is
very
lucky
as
he
might
have
picked
up
with
a
girl
without
a
single
copper
nail
to
be
sure
there
was
a
time
we
had
when
we
got
into
port
it
was
open
house
for
us
all
and
after
mentally
regarding
the
scene
for
a
few
seconds
jim
emptied
his
cup
and
rose
to
go
the
miller
was
saying
some
last
words
to
him
outside
the
house
voice
had
hardly
ceased
singing
upstairs
john
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
and
loveday
was
crossing
the
room
to
join
her
daughter
whose
manner
had
given
her
some
uneasiness
when
a
noise
came
from
above
the
ceiling
as
of
some
heavy
body
falling
loveday
rushed
to
the
staircase
saying
i
feared
something
and
she
was
followed
by
john
when
they
entered
anne
room
which
they
both
did
almost
at
one
moment
they
found
her
lying
insensible
upon
the
floor
the
his
lips
tightly
closed
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
laid
her
upon
the
bed
after
which
he
went
back
to
the
door
to
give
room
to
her
mother
who
was
bending
over
the
girl
with
some
hartshorn
presently
loveday
looked
up
and
said
to
him
is
only
in
a
faint
john
and
her
colour
is
coming
back
now
leave
her
to
me
i
will
be
downstairs
in
a
few
minutes
and
tell
you
how
she
is
john
left
the
room
when
he
gained
the
lower
apartment
his
father
was
standing
by
the
the
sailor
having
gone
the
went
up
to
the
fire
and
grasping
the
edge
of
the
high
stood
silent
i
hear
a
noise
when
i
went
out
asked
the
elder
in
a
tone
of
misgiving
you
did
said
john
was
she
but
her
mother
says
she
is
better
now
father
he
added
impetuously
is
a
worthless
blockhead
if
there
had
been
any
good
in
him
he
would
have
been
drowned
years
ago
john
not
too
fast
said
the
miller
a
hard
thing
to
say
of
your
brother
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
he
tries
me
more
than
i
can
bear
good
god
what
can
a
man
be
made
of
to
go
on
as
he
does
why
did
he
come
home
or
if
he
get
leave
why
did
he
write
is
scandalous
of
him
to
serve
a
woman
like
that
gently
the
chap
hev
done
his
duty
as
a
sailor
and
though
there
might
have
been
something
between
him
and
anne
her
mother
in
talking
it
over
with
me
has
said
many
times
that
she
could
think
of
their
marrying
till
bob
had
settled
down
in
business
with
me
folks
that
gain
victories
must
have
a
little
liberty
allowed
look
at
the
admiral
himself
for
that
matter
john
continued
looking
at
the
red
coals
till
hearing
loveday
foot
on
the
staircase
he
went
to
meet
her
is
better
said
loveday
she
wo
come
down
again
day
could
john
have
heard
what
the
poor
girl
was
moaning
to
herself
at
that
moment
as
she
lay
writhing
on
the
bed
he
would
have
doubted
her
assurance
he
had
been
dead
i
could
have
borne
it
but
this
i
can
not
bear
xxxvi
derriman
sees
chances
meanwhile
sailor
cornick
had
gone
on
his
way
as
far
as
the
forking
roads
where
he
met
festus
derriman
on
foot
the
latter
attracted
by
the
seaman
dress
and
by
seeing
him
come
from
the
mill
at
once
accosted
him
jim
with
the
greatest
readiness
fell
into
conversation
and
told
the
same
story
as
that
he
had
related
at
the
mill
loveday
going
to
be
married
repeated
festus
all
seem
struck
of
a
heap
wi
that
i
never
heard
news
that
pleased
me
more
when
cornick
was
gone
festus
instead
of
passing
straight
on
halted
on
the
little
bridge
and
meditated
bob
being
now
interested
elsewhere
would
probably
not
resent
the
siege
of
anne
heart
by
another
there
could
at
any
rate
be
no
further
possibility
of
that
looming
duel
which
had
troubled
the
yeoman
mind
ever
since
his
on
anne
at
the
house
on
the
down
to
march
into
the
mill
and
propose
to
loveday
for
anne
before
john
interest
could
revive
in
her
was
to
this
thinking
excellent
discretion
the
day
had
already
begun
to
darken
when
he
entered
and
the
cheerful
fire
shone
red
upon
the
floor
and
walls
loveday
received
him
alone
and
asked
him
to
take
a
seat
by
the
a
little
of
the
old
hankering
for
him
as
a
having
permanently
remained
with
her
servant
loveday
he
said
i
will
tell
you
at
once
what
i
come
for
you
will
say
that
i
take
time
by
the
forelock
when
i
inform
you
that
it
is
to
push
on
my
alliance
wi
your
daughter
as
i
believe
she
is
now
a
free
woman
again
you
derriman
said
the
mother
placably
she
is
ill
at
present
i
mention
it
to
her
when
she
is
better
her
to
alter
her
cruel
cruel
resolves
against
me
on
the
score
of
of
my
consuming
passion
for
her
in
short
continued
festus
dropping
his
parlour
language
in
his
warmth
tell
thee
what
dame
loveday
i
want
the
maid
and
must
have
her
loveday
replied
that
that
was
very
plain
speaking
is
but
bob
has
given
her
up
he
never
meant
to
marry
her
i
tell
you
loveday
what
i
have
never
told
a
soul
before
i
was
standing
upon
budmouth
quay
on
that
very
day
in
last
september
that
bob
set
sail
and
i
heard
him
say
to
his
brother
john
that
he
gave
your
daughter
up
it
was
very
unmannerly
of
him
to
trifle
with
her
so
said
loveday
warmly
did
he
give
her
up
to
festus
replied
with
hesitation
gave
her
up
to
john
john
how
could
he
give
her
up
to
a
man
already
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
that
actress
woman
you
surprise
me
which
actress
is
it
miss
johnson
anne
tells
me
that
he
loves
her
hopelessly
festus
arose
miss
johnson
seemed
suddenly
to
acquire
high
value
as
a
sweetheart
at
this
announcement
he
had
himself
felt
a
nameless
attractiveness
in
her
and
john
had
done
likewise
john
crossed
his
path
in
all
possible
ways
before
the
yeoman
had
replied
somebody
opened
the
door
and
the
firelight
shone
upon
the
uniform
of
the
person
they
discussed
festus
nodded
on
recognizing
him
wished
loveday
good
evening
and
went
out
precipitately
bob
told
you
he
meant
to
break
off
with
my
anne
when
he
went
away
loveday
remarked
to
the
wish
i
had
known
of
it
before
john
appeared
disturbed
at
the
sudden
charge
he
murmured
that
he
could
not
deny
it
and
then
hastily
turned
from
her
and
followed
derriman
whom
he
saw
before
him
on
the
bridge
he
shouted
festus
started
and
looked
round
he
said
blandly
will
you
have
sense
enough
to
mind
your
own
business
and
not
come
here
telling
things
you
have
heard
by
sneaking
behind
people
backs
demanded
john
hotly
you
ca
learn
in
any
other
way
i
shall
have
to
pull
your
ears
again
as
i
did
the
other
day
pull
my
ears
how
can
you
tell
that
lie
when
you
know
was
somebody
else
pulled
no
no
i
pulled
your
ears
and
thrashed
you
in
a
mild
way
swear
to
it
surely
was
another
man
was
in
the
parlour
at
the
you
were
almost
in
the
dark
and
john
added
a
few
details
as
to
the
particular
blows
which
amounted
to
proof
itself
i
heartily
ask
your
pardon
for
saying
was
a
lie
cried
festus
advancing
with
extended
hand
and
a
genial
smile
if
i
had
known
you
i
would
have
insulted
you
by
denying
it
was
why
you
did
challenge
me
then
was
it
i
would
for
the
world
have
hurt
your
nice
sense
of
honour
by
letting
go
unchallenged
if
i
had
known
and
now
you
see
unfortunately
i
ca
mend
the
mistake
so
long
a
time
has
passed
since
it
happened
that
the
heat
of
my
temper
is
gone
off
i
could
oblige
try
how
i
might
for
i
am
not
a
man
that
can
butcher
in
cold
blood
no
not
i
nor
you
neither
from
what
i
know
of
so
we
must
fain
let
it
pass
eh
must
i
suppose
said
john
smiling
grimly
did
you
think
i
was
then
that
night
when
i
boxed
you
all
round
do
press
me
replied
the
yeoman
ca
reveal
it
would
be
disgracing
myself
to
show
how
very
wide
of
the
truth
the
mockery
of
wine
was
able
to
lead
my
senses
we
will
let
it
be
buried
in
eternal
mixens
of
forgetfulness
you
wish
said
the
loftily
if
you
ever
think
you
knew
it
was
me
why
you
know
where
to
find
me
and
loveday
walked
away
the
instant
that
he
was
gone
festus
shook
his
fist
at
the
evening
star
which
happened
to
lie
in
the
same
direction
as
that
taken
by
the
dragoon
for
my
revenge
duels
lifelong
disgrace
to
me
if
ever
i
fight
with
a
man
of
blood
below
my
own
there
are
other
remedies
for
class
souls
matilda
that
my
way
festus
strode
along
till
he
reached
the
hall
where
cripplestraw
appeared
gazing
at
him
from
under
the
arch
of
the
porter
lodge
derriman
dashed
open
the
with
such
violence
that
the
whole
row
of
them
fell
flat
in
the
mud
maister
festus
said
cripplestraw
surely
i
says
to
myself
when
i
see
ye
surely
maister
festus
is
fuming
like
that
because
there
no
chance
of
the
enemy
coming
this
year
after
all
i
have
been
wounded
to
the
heart
replied
derriman
with
a
lurid
brow
the
man
yet
lives
and
you
wants
yer
instantly
certainly
maister
f
cripplestraw
not
my
pistols
but
my
clothes
my
heavy
gold
seals
my
cane
and
my
buckles
that
cost
more
money
than
he
ever
saw
yes
i
must
tell
somebody
and
i
tell
you
because
no
other
fool
near
he
loves
her
heart
and
soul
he
poor
she
top
genteel
and
not
rich
i
am
rich
by
comparison
i
court
the
pretty
and
win
her
before
his
eyes
maister
derriman
i
saw
her
this
very
day
met
her
by
accident
and
spoke
to
her
she
still
in
the
town
perhaps
because
of
him
i
can
meet
her
at
any
hour
of
the
day
but
i
do
mean
to
marry
her
not
i
will
court
her
for
my
pastime
and
to
annoy
him
it
will
be
all
the
more
death
to
him
that
i
do
want
her
then
perhaps
he
will
say
to
me
you
have
taken
my
one
ewe
lamb
meaning
that
i
am
the
king
and
he
the
poor
man
as
in
the
church
verse
and
he
beg
for
mercy
when
is
too
late
unless
meanwhile
i
shall
have
tired
of
my
new
toy
saddle
the
horse
cripplestraw
at
ten
full
of
this
resolve
to
scourge
john
loveday
to
the
quick
through
his
passion
for
miss
johnson
festus
came
out
booted
and
spurred
at
the
time
appointed
and
set
off
on
his
morning
ride
miss
johnson
theatrical
engagement
having
long
ago
terminated
she
would
have
left
the
royal
with
the
rest
of
the
visitors
had
not
matrimonial
hopes
detained
her
there
these
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
john
loveday
as
may
be
imagined
but
with
a
stout
staid
builder
in
cove
row
by
the
quay
who
had
shown
much
interest
in
her
impersonations
unfortunately
this
substantial
man
had
not
been
quite
so
attentive
since
the
end
of
the
season
as
his
previous
manner
led
her
to
expect
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
the
lady
to
see
derriman
leaning
over
the
harbour
bridge
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
as
she
came
towards
it
after
a
stroll
past
her
elderly
wooer
house
take
it
you
did
tell
me
when
i
saw
you
last
that
the
tooting
man
with
the
blue
jacket
and
lace
was
yours
devoted
began
festus
do
you
mean
in
matilda
emotional
interests
john
loveday
was
a
stale
and
unprofitable
personality
that
man
what
of
him
he
loves
you
and
you
know
it
she
knew
at
any
rate
how
to
take
the
current
when
it
served
so
she
glanced
at
festus
folded
her
lips
meaningly
and
nodded
come
to
cut
him
out
she
shook
her
head
it
being
unsafe
to
speak
till
she
knew
a
little
more
of
the
subject
said
festus
reddening
you
mean
to
say
that
you
think
of
him
seriously
you
who
might
look
so
much
higher
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
and
you
should
only
hear
his
pleading
his
handsome
face
is
impressive
and
his
manners
are
o
so
genteel
i
am
not
rich
i
am
in
short
a
poor
lady
of
decayed
family
who
has
nothing
to
boast
of
but
my
blood
and
ancestors
and
they
find
a
body
in
food
and
clothing
i
hold
the
world
but
as
the
world
derrimanio
a
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
and
mine
a
sad
one
she
dropped
her
eyes
thoughtfully
and
sighed
will
talk
of
this
said
festus
much
affected
us
walk
to
the
she
made
no
objection
and
said
as
they
turned
that
way
derriman
a
long
time
ago
i
found
something
belonging
to
you
but
i
have
never
yet
remembered
to
return
it
and
she
drew
from
her
bosom
the
paper
which
anne
had
dropped
in
the
meadow
when
eluding
the
grasp
of
festus
on
that
summer
day
i
smell
fresh
meat
cried
festus
when
he
had
looked
it
over
in
my
uncle
writing
and
is
what
i
heard
him
singing
on
the
day
the
french
did
come
and
afterwards
saw
him
marking
in
the
road
is
something
he
got
hid
away
give
me
the
paper
there
a
dear
is
worth
sterling
gold
then
said
matilda
tenderly
yes
anything
replied
festus
blazing
into
a
smile
for
she
had
looked
up
in
her
best
new
manner
at
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
worth
the
winning
they
went
up
the
steps
to
the
summit
of
the
cliff
and
dwindled
over
it
against
the
sky
xxxvii
reaction
there
was
no
letter
from
bob
though
december
had
passed
and
the
new
year
was
two
weeks
old
his
movements
were
however
pretty
accurately
registered
in
the
papers
which
john
still
brought
but
which
anne
no
longer
read
during
the
second
week
in
december
the
victory
sailed
for
sheerness
and
on
the
of
the
following
january
the
public
funeral
of
lord
nelson
took
place
in
paul
then
there
came
a
meagre
line
addressed
to
the
family
in
general
new
portsmouth
attachment
was
not
mentioned
but
he
told
them
he
had
been
one
of
the
seamen
who
walked
in
the
funeral
procession
and
that
captain
hardy
had
borne
the
banner
of
emblems
on
the
same
occasion
the
crew
was
soon
to
be
paid
off
at
chatham
when
he
thought
of
returning
to
portsmouth
for
a
few
days
to
see
a
valued
friend
after
that
he
should
come
home
but
the
spring
advanced
without
bringing
him
and
john
watched
anne
garland
desolation
with
augmenting
desire
to
do
something
towards
consoling
her
the
old
feelings
so
religiously
held
in
check
were
stimulated
to
rebelliousness
though
they
did
not
show
themselves
in
any
direct
manner
as
yet
the
miller
in
the
meantime
who
seldom
interfered
in
such
matters
was
observed
to
look
meaningly
at
anne
and
the
from
day
to
day
and
he
spoke
privately
to
john
his
words
were
short
and
to
the
point
anne
was
very
melancholy
she
had
thought
too
much
of
bob
now
was
plain
that
they
had
lost
him
for
many
years
to
come
well
he
had
always
felt
that
of
the
two
he
would
rather
john
married
her
now
john
might
settle
down
there
and
succeed
where
bob
had
failed
if
you
could
get
her
my
sonny
to
think
less
of
him
and
more
of
thyself
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
all
an
inward
excitement
had
risen
in
john
but
he
suppressed
it
and
said
firmly
to
bob
before
everything
hev
forgot
her
and
there
an
end
o
not
forgot
him
well
think
it
over
this
discourse
was
the
cause
of
his
penning
a
letter
to
his
brother
he
begged
for
a
distinct
statement
whether
as
john
at
first
supposed
verbal
renunciation
of
anne
on
the
quay
had
been
only
a
momentary
ebullition
of
friendship
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
take
literally
or
whether
as
seemed
now
it
had
passed
from
a
hasty
resolve
to
a
standing
purpose
persevered
in
for
his
own
pleasure
with
not
a
care
for
the
result
on
poor
anne
john
waited
anxiously
for
the
answer
but
no
answer
came
and
the
silence
seemed
even
more
significant
than
a
letter
of
assurance
could
have
been
of
his
absolution
from
further
support
to
a
claim
which
bob
himself
had
so
clearly
renounced
thus
it
happened
that
paternal
pressure
brotherly
indifference
and
his
own
released
impulse
operated
in
one
delightful
direction
and
the
once
more
approached
anne
as
in
the
old
time
but
it
was
not
till
she
had
been
left
to
herself
for
a
full
five
months
and
the
and
of
the
following
year
were
again
making
themselves
common
to
the
rambling
eye
that
he
directly
addressed
her
she
was
tying
up
a
group
of
tall
flowering
plants
in
the
garden
she
knew
that
he
was
behind
her
but
she
did
not
turn
she
had
subsided
into
a
placid
dignity
which
enabled
her
when
watched
to
perform
any
little
action
with
seeming
composure
very
different
from
the
flutter
of
her
inexperienced
days
you
never
going
to
turn
round
he
at
length
asked
she
then
did
turn
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
without
speaking
a
certain
suspicion
looming
in
her
eyes
as
if
suggested
by
his
perceptible
want
of
ease
like
summer
it
is
getting
to
feel
is
it
not
she
said
john
admitted
that
it
was
getting
to
feel
like
summer
and
bending
his
gaze
upon
her
with
an
earnestness
which
no
longer
left
any
doubt
of
his
subject
went
on
to
ask
you
ever
in
these
last
weeks
thought
of
how
it
used
to
be
between
us
she
replied
quickly
john
you
should
begin
that
again
i
am
almost
another
woman
now
that
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
is
it
anne
looked
thoughtfully
to
the
other
end
of
the
garden
faintly
shaking
her
head
do
quite
see
it
like
that
she
returned
feel
yourself
quite
free
do
you
free
she
said
instantly
and
with
proud
distinctness
her
eyes
fell
and
she
repeated
more
slowly
free
then
her
thoughts
seemed
to
fly
from
herself
to
him
you
are
not
am
not
johnson
that
woman
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
was
all
and
that
i
never
for
a
moment
thought
of
her
had
an
idea
you
were
acting
but
i
was
sure
that
nothing
now
anne
i
want
to
relieve
your
life
to
cheer
you
in
some
way
to
make
some
amends
for
my
brother
bad
conduct
if
you
can
not
love
me
liking
will
be
well
enough
i
have
thought
over
every
side
of
it
so
many
times
for
months
have
i
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
am
at
last
sure
that
i
do
right
to
put
it
to
you
in
this
way
that
i
do
wrong
bob
i
am
quite
convinced
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
we
be
both
free
had
i
not
been
sure
of
that
i
would
never
have
spoken
father
wants
me
to
take
on
the
mill
and
it
will
please
him
if
you
can
give
me
one
little
hope
it
will
make
the
house
go
on
altogether
better
if
you
can
think
o
me
are
generous
and
good
john
she
said
as
a
big
round
tear
bowled
down
her
face
and
am
not
that
i
fear
i
am
quite
the
opposite
he
said
without
looking
at
her
would
be
all
gain
to
me
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
she
lifted
her
eyes
i
can
not
she
said
with
a
cheerless
smile
i
can
not
will
you
make
me
a
promise
is
it
want
you
to
promise
first
yes
it
is
dreadfully
unreasonable
she
added
in
a
mild
distress
do
promise
john
by
this
time
seemed
to
have
a
feeling
that
it
was
all
up
with
him
for
the
present
promise
he
said
listlessly
is
that
you
wo
speak
to
me
about
this
for
so
long
she
returned
with
emphatic
kindliness
good
he
replied
good
dear
anne
you
do
think
i
have
been
unmanly
or
unfair
in
starting
this
anew
anne
looked
into
his
face
without
a
smile
have
been
perfectly
natural
she
murmured
so
i
think
have
i
john
mournfully
will
not
avoid
me
for
this
or
be
afraid
of
me
i
will
not
break
my
word
i
will
not
worry
you
any
more
you
john
you
need
not
have
said
worry
it
is
that
i
am
very
blind
and
stupid
i
have
been
hurting
your
heart
all
the
time
without
knowing
it
it
is
my
fate
i
suppose
men
who
love
women
the
very
best
always
blunder
and
give
more
pain
than
those
who
love
them
less
anne
laid
one
of
her
hands
on
the
other
as
she
softly
replied
looking
down
at
them
one
loves
me
as
well
as
you
john
nobody
in
the
world
is
so
worthy
to
be
loved
and
yet
i
can
not
anyhow
love
you
rightly
and
lifting
her
eyes
i
do
so
feel
for
you
that
i
will
try
as
hard
as
i
can
to
think
about
you
that
is
something
he
said
smiling
say
i
must
not
speak
about
it
again
for
ever
so
long
how
long
that
not
fair
anne
retorted
going
down
the
garden
and
leaving
him
alone
about
a
week
passed
then
one
afternoon
the
miller
walked
up
to
anne
indoors
a
weighty
topic
being
expressed
in
his
tread
was
so
glad
my
honey
he
began
with
a
knowing
smile
see
that
from
the
last
week
he
flung
a
nod
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
anne
innocently
inquired
what
it
could
be
and
you
in
the
garden
together
he
continued
laying
his
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
and
stroking
it
would
so
please
me
my
dear
little
girl
if
you
could
get
to
like
him
better
than
that
weathercock
master
bob
anne
shook
her
head
not
in
forcible
negation
but
to
imply
a
kind
of
neutrality
you
come
now
said
the
miller
she
threw
back
her
head
with
a
little
laugh
of
grievance
you
all
beset
me
she
expostulated
makes
me
feel
very
wicked
in
not
obeying
you
and
being
faithful
faithful
to
but
she
could
not
trust
that
side
of
the
subject
to
words
would
it
please
you
so
much
she
asked
is
as
steady
and
staunch
a
fellow
as
ever
blowed
a
trumpet
always
thought
you
might
do
better
with
him
than
with
bob
now
i
a
plan
for
taking
him
into
the
mill
and
letting
him
have
a
comfortable
time
after
his
long
knocking
about
but
so
much
depends
upon
you
that
i
must
bide
a
bit
till
i
see
what
your
pleasure
is
about
the
poor
fellow
mind
my
dear
i
do
want
to
force
ye
i
only
just
ask
ye
anne
meditatively
regarded
the
miller
from
under
her
shady
eyelids
the
fingers
of
one
hand
playing
a
silent
tattoo
on
her
bosom
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
she
answered
brusquely
and
went
away
but
these
discourses
were
not
without
their
effect
upon
the
extremely
conscientious
mind
of
anne
they
were
moreover
much
helped
by
an
incident
which
took
place
one
evening
in
the
autumn
of
this
year
when
john
came
to
tea
anne
was
sitting
on
a
low
stool
in
front
of
the
fire
her
hands
clasped
across
her
knee
john
loveday
had
just
seated
himself
on
a
chair
close
behind
her
and
loveday
was
in
the
act
of
filling
the
teapot
from
the
kettle
which
hung
in
the
chimney
exactly
above
anne
the
kettle
slipped
forward
suddenly
whereupon
john
jumped
from
the
chair
and
put
his
own
two
hands
over
anne
just
in
time
to
shield
them
and
the
precious
knee
she
clasped
from
the
jet
of
scalding
water
which
had
directed
itself
upon
that
point
the
accidental
overflow
was
instantly
checked
by
loveday
but
what
had
come
was
received
by
the
devoted
on
the
back
of
his
hands
anne
who
had
hardly
been
aware
that
he
was
behind
her
started
up
like
a
person
awakened
from
a
trance
have
you
done
to
yourself
poor
john
to
keep
it
off
me
she
cried
looking
at
his
hands
john
reddened
emotionally
at
her
words
is
a
bit
of
a
scald
all
he
replied
drawing
a
finger
across
the
back
of
one
hand
and
bringing
off
the
skin
by
the
touch
are
scalded
painfully
and
i
not
at
all
she
gazed
into
his
kind
face
as
she
had
never
gazed
there
before
and
when
loveday
came
back
with
oil
and
other
liniments
for
the
wound
anne
would
let
nobody
dress
it
but
herself
it
seemed
as
if
her
coyness
had
all
gone
and
when
she
had
done
all
that
lay
in
her
power
she
still
sat
by
him
at
his
departure
she
said
what
she
had
never
said
to
him
in
her
life
before
again
soon
in
short
that
impulsive
act
of
devotion
the
last
of
a
series
of
the
same
tenor
had
been
the
added
drop
which
finally
turned
the
wheel
john
character
deeply
impressed
her
his
determined
steadfastness
to
his
lode
star
won
her
admiration
the
more
especially
as
that
star
was
herself
she
began
to
wonder
more
and
more
how
she
could
have
so
persistently
held
out
against
his
advances
before
bob
came
home
to
renew
girlish
memories
which
had
by
that
time
got
considerably
weakened
could
she
not
after
all
please
the
miller
and
try
to
listen
to
john
by
so
doing
she
would
make
a
worthy
man
happy
the
only
sacrifice
being
at
worst
that
of
her
unworthy
self
whose
future
was
no
longer
valuable
for
bob
the
woman
is
to
be
pitied
who
loves
him
she
reflected
indignantly
and
persuaded
herself
that
whoever
the
woman
might
be
she
was
not
anne
garland
after
this
there
was
something
of
recklessness
and
something
of
pleasantry
in
the
young
girl
manner
of
making
herself
an
example
of
the
triumph
of
pride
and
common
sense
over
memory
and
sentiment
her
attitude
had
been
epitomized
in
her
defiant
singing
at
the
time
she
learnt
that
bob
was
not
leal
and
true
john
as
was
inevitable
came
again
almost
immediately
drawn
thither
by
the
sun
of
her
first
smile
on
him
and
the
words
which
had
accompanied
it
and
now
instead
of
going
off
to
her
little
pursuits
upstairs
downstairs
across
the
room
in
the
corner
or
to
any
place
except
where
he
happened
to
be
as
had
been
her
custom
hitherto
she
remained
seated
near
him
returning
interesting
answers
to
his
general
remarks
and
at
every
opportunity
letting
him
know
that
at
last
he
had
found
favour
in
her
eyes
the
day
was
fine
and
they
went
out
of
doors
where
anne
endeavoured
to
seat
herself
on
the
sloping
stone
of
the
good
you
have
become
lately
said
john
standing
over
her
and
smiling
in
the
sunlight
which
blazed
against
the
wall
fancy
you
have
stayed
at
home
this
afternoon
on
my
account
i
have
she
said
gaily
do
whatever
we
may
for
him
dame
we
can
not
do
too
much
for
he
one
that
has
guarded
our
land
he
has
done
more
than
that
he
has
saved
me
from
a
dreadful
scalding
the
back
of
your
hand
will
not
be
well
for
a
long
time
john
will
it
he
held
out
his
hand
to
regard
its
condition
and
the
next
natural
thing
was
to
take
hers
there
was
a
glow
upon
his
face
when
he
did
it
his
star
was
at
last
on
a
fair
way
towards
the
zenith
after
its
long
and
weary
declination
the
least
penetrating
eye
could
have
perceived
that
anne
had
resolved
to
let
him
woo
possibly
in
her
temerity
to
let
him
win
whatever
silent
sorrow
might
be
locked
up
in
her
it
was
by
this
time
thrust
a
long
way
down
from
the
light
want
you
to
go
somewhere
with
me
if
you
will
he
said
still
holding
her
hand
where
is
it
he
pointed
to
a
distant
which
hitherto
green
had
within
the
last
few
days
begun
to
show
scratches
of
white
on
its
face
there
he
said
see
little
figures
of
men
moving
about
what
are
they
doing
out
a
huge
picture
of
the
king
on
horseback
in
the
earth
of
the
hill
the
king
head
is
to
be
as
big
as
our
and
his
body
as
big
as
this
garden
he
and
the
horse
will
cover
more
than
an
acre
when
shall
we
go
you
please
said
she
cried
loveday
from
the
front
door
a
friend
come
for
you
john
went
round
and
found
his
trusty
lieutenant
trumpeter
buck
waiting
for
him
a
letter
had
come
to
the
barracks
for
john
in
his
absence
and
the
trumpeter
who
was
going
for
a
walk
had
brought
it
along
with
him
buck
then
entered
the
mill
to
discuss
if
possible
a
mug
of
last
mead
with
the
miller
and
john
proceeded
to
read
his
letter
anne
being
still
round
the
corner
where
he
had
left
her
when
he
had
read
a
few
words
he
turned
as
pale
as
a
sheet
but
he
did
not
move
and
perused
the
writing
to
the
end
afterwards
he
laid
his
elbow
against
the
wall
and
put
his
palm
to
his
head
thinking
with
painful
intentness
then
he
took
himself
vigorously
in
hand
as
it
were
and
gradually
became
natural
again
when
he
parted
from
anne
to
go
home
with
buck
she
noticed
nothing
different
in
him
in
barracks
that
evening
he
read
the
letter
again
it
was
from
bob
and
the
agitating
contents
were
these
john
i
have
drifted
off
from
writing
till
the
present
time
because
i
have
not
been
clear
about
my
feelings
but
i
have
discovered
them
at
last
and
can
say
beyond
doubt
that
i
mean
to
be
faithful
to
my
dearest
anne
after
all
the
fact
is
john
i
got
into
a
bit
of
a
scrape
and
i
a
secret
to
tell
you
about
it
which
must
go
no
further
on
any
account
on
landing
last
autumn
i
fell
in
with
a
young
woman
and
we
got
rather
warm
as
folks
do
in
short
we
liked
one
another
well
enough
for
a
while
but
i
have
got
into
shoal
water
with
her
and
have
found
her
to
be
a
terrible
nothing
in
her
at
all
no
sense
no
niceness
all
tantrums
and
empty
noise
john
though
she
seemed
monstrous
clever
at
first
so
my
heart
comes
back
to
its
old
anchorage
i
hope
my
return
to
faithfulness
will
make
no
difference
to
you
but
as
you
showed
by
your
looks
at
our
parting
that
you
should
not
accept
my
offer
to
give
her
up
made
in
too
much
haste
as
i
have
since
found
i
feel
that
you
wo
mind
that
i
have
returned
to
the
path
of
honour
i
dare
not
write
to
anne
as
yet
and
please
do
not
let
her
know
a
word
about
the
other
young
woman
or
there
will
be
the
devil
to
pay
i
shall
come
home
and
make
all
things
right
please
god
in
the
meantime
i
should
take
it
as
a
kindness
john
if
you
would
keep
a
brotherly
eye
upon
anne
and
guide
her
mind
back
to
me
i
shall
die
of
sorrow
if
anybody
sets
her
against
me
for
my
hopes
are
getting
bound
up
in
her
again
quite
strong
hoping
you
are
jovial
as
times
go
i
am
your
affectionate
brother
robert
when
the
cold
daylight
fell
upon
john
face
as
he
dressed
himself
next
morning
the
incipient
yesterday
wrinkle
in
his
forehead
had
become
permanently
graven
there
he
had
resolved
for
the
sake
of
that
only
brother
whom
he
had
nursed
as
a
baby
instructed
as
a
child
and
protected
and
loved
always
to
pause
in
his
procedure
for
the
present
and
at
least
do
nothing
to
hinder
bob
restoration
to
favour
if
a
genuine
even
though
temporarily
smothered
love
for
anne
should
still
hold
possession
of
him
but
having
arranged
to
take
her
to
see
the
excavated
figure
of
the
king
he
started
for
overcombe
during
the
day
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
check
the
smooth
course
of
his
love
xxxviii
a
delicate
situation
am
ready
to
go
said
anne
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
paused
as
if
taken
aback
by
her
readiness
and
replied
with
much
uncertainty
it
would
it
be
better
to
put
it
off
till
there
is
less
sun
the
very
slightest
symptom
of
surprise
arose
in
her
as
she
rejoined
the
weather
may
change
or
had
we
better
not
go
at
all
no
it
was
only
a
thought
we
will
start
at
once
and
along
the
vale
they
went
john
keeping
himself
about
a
yard
from
her
right
hand
when
the
third
field
had
been
crossed
they
came
upon
dozen
little
boys
at
play
do
he
clasp
her
to
his
side
like
a
man
said
the
biggest
and
rudest
boy
do
he
clasp
her
to
his
side
like
a
man
echoed
all
the
rude
smaller
boys
in
a
chorus
the
turned
and
after
some
running
succeeded
in
smacking
two
of
them
with
his
switch
returning
to
anne
breathless
am
ashamed
they
should
have
insulted
you
so
he
said
blushing
for
her
said
no
harm
poor
boys
she
replied
reproachfully
poor
john
was
dumb
with
perception
the
gentle
hint
upon
which
he
would
have
eagerly
spoken
only
one
short
day
ago
was
now
like
fire
to
his
wound
they
presently
came
to
some
across
a
brook
john
crossed
first
without
turning
his
head
and
anne
just
lifting
the
skirt
of
her
dress
crossed
behind
him
when
they
had
reached
the
other
side
a
village
girl
and
a
young
shepherd
approached
the
brink
to
cross
anne
stopped
and
watched
them
the
shepherd
took
a
hand
of
the
young
girl
in
each
of
his
own
and
walked
backward
over
the
stones
facing
her
and
keeping
her
upright
by
his
grasp
both
of
them
laughing
as
they
went
are
you
staying
for
miss
garland
asked
john
was
only
thinking
how
happy
they
are
she
said
quietly
and
withdrawing
her
eyes
from
the
tender
pair
she
turned
and
followed
him
not
knowing
that
the
seeming
sound
of
a
passing
was
a
suppressed
groan
from
john
when
they
reached
the
hill
they
found
forty
navvies
at
work
removing
the
dark
sod
so
as
to
lay
bare
the
chalk
beneath
the
equestrian
figure
that
their
shovels
were
forming
was
scarcely
intelligible
to
john
and
anne
now
they
were
close
and
after
pacing
from
the
horse
head
down
his
breast
to
his
hoof
back
by
way
of
the
king
past
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
into
his
anne
said
that
she
had
had
enough
of
it
and
stepped
out
of
the
chalk
clearing
upon
the
grass
the
had
remained
all
the
time
in
a
melancholy
attitude
within
the
rowel
of
his
majesty
right
spur
shoes
are
caked
with
chalk
she
said
as
they
walked
downwards
again
and
she
drew
back
her
dress
to
look
at
them
can
i
get
some
of
it
cleared
off
you
was
to
wipe
them
in
the
long
grass
there
said
john
pointing
to
a
spot
where
the
blades
were
rank
and
dense
of
it
would
come
off
having
said
this
he
walked
on
with
religious
firmness
anne
raked
her
little
feet
on
the
right
side
on
the
left
side
over
the
toe
and
behind
the
heel
but
the
tenacious
chalk
held
its
own
panting
with
her
exertion
she
gave
it
up
and
at
length
overtook
him
hope
it
is
right
now
he
said
looking
gingerly
over
his
shoulder
indeed
said
she
wanted
some
assistance
some
one
to
steady
me
it
is
so
hard
to
stand
on
one
foot
and
wipe
the
other
without
support
i
was
in
danger
of
toppling
over
and
so
gave
it
up
stars
what
an
opportunity
thought
the
poor
fellow
while
she
waited
for
him
to
offer
help
but
his
lips
remained
closed
and
she
went
on
with
a
pouting
smile
seem
in
such
a
hurry
why
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
after
all
the
fine
things
you
have
said
about
about
caring
so
much
for
me
and
all
that
you
wo
stop
for
anything
it
was
too
much
for
john
my
heart
and
life
my
dea
he
began
here
bob
letter
crackled
warningly
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
as
he
laid
his
hand
asseveratingly
upon
his
breast
and
he
became
suddenly
scaled
up
to
dumbness
and
gloom
as
before
when
they
reached
home
anne
sank
upon
a
stool
outside
the
door
fatigued
with
her
excursion
her
first
act
was
to
try
to
pull
off
her
shoe
it
was
a
difficult
matter
but
john
stood
beating
with
his
switch
the
leaves
of
the
creeper
on
the
wall
david
molly
or
somebody
do
come
and
help
me
pull
off
these
dirty
shoes
she
cried
aloud
at
last
helps
me
in
anything
am
very
sorry
said
john
coming
towards
her
with
incredible
slowness
and
an
air
of
unutterable
depression
i
can
do
without
david
is
best
she
returned
as
the
old
man
approached
and
removed
the
obnoxious
shoes
in
a
trice
anne
was
amazed
at
this
sudden
change
from
devotion
to
crass
indifference
on
entering
her
room
she
flew
to
the
glass
almost
expecting
to
learn
that
some
extraordinary
change
had
come
over
her
pretty
countenance
rendering
her
intolerable
for
evermore
but
it
was
if
anything
fresher
than
usual
on
account
of
the
exercise
she
said
retrospectively
for
the
first
time
since
their
acqaintance
she
had
this
week
encouraged
him
and
for
the
first
time
he
had
shown
that
encouragement
was
useless
perhaps
he
does
not
clearly
understand
she
added
serenely
when
he
next
came
it
was
to
her
surprise
to
bring
her
newspapers
now
for
some
time
discontinued
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
she
said
do
not
care
for
newspapers
shipping
news
is
very
full
and
long
though
the
print
is
rather
small
take
no
further
interest
in
the
shipping
news
she
replied
with
cold
dignity
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
inside
the
table
and
hence
when
in
spite
of
her
negations
he
deliberately
unfolded
the
paper
and
began
to
read
about
the
royal
navy
she
could
hardly
rise
and
go
away
with
a
stoical
mien
he
read
on
to
the
end
of
the
report
bringing
out
the
name
of
ship
with
tremendous
force
she
said
at
last
hear
no
more
let
me
read
to
you
the
sat
down
anne
turned
to
the
military
news
delivering
every
detail
with
much
apparent
enthusiasm
the
subject
like
she
said
fervently
but
bob
is
in
the
navy
now
and
will
most
likely
rise
to
be
an
officer
and
then
is
there
like
the
army
she
interrupted
is
no
smartness
about
sailors
they
waddle
like
ducks
and
they
only
fight
stupid
battles
that
no
one
can
form
any
idea
of
there
is
no
science
nor
stratagem
in
nothing
more
than
what
you
see
when
two
rams
run
their
heads
together
in
a
field
to
knock
each
other
down
but
in
military
battles
there
is
such
art
and
such
splendour
and
the
men
are
so
smart
particularly
the
o
i
shall
never
forget
what
gallant
men
you
all
seemed
when
you
came
and
pitched
your
tents
on
the
downs
i
like
the
cavalry
better
than
anything
i
know
and
the
dragoons
the
best
of
the
cavalry
and
the
trumpeters
the
best
of
the
dragoons
if
it
had
but
come
a
little
sooner
moaned
john
within
him
he
replied
as
soon
as
he
could
regain
am
glad
bob
is
in
the
navy
at
last
he
is
so
much
more
fitted
for
that
than
the
so
brave
by
nature
ready
for
any
daring
deed
i
have
heard
ever
so
much
more
about
his
doings
on
board
the
victory
captain
hardy
took
special
notice
that
when
he
do
want
to
know
anything
more
about
it
said
anne
impatiently
course
sailors
fight
there
nothing
else
to
do
in
a
ship
since
you
ca
run
away
you
may
as
well
fight
and
be
killed
as
be
killed
not
fighting
it
is
his
character
to
be
careless
of
himself
where
the
honour
of
his
country
is
concerned
john
pleaded
you
had
only
known
him
as
a
boy
you
would
own
it
he
would
always
risk
his
own
life
to
save
anybody
else
once
when
a
cottage
was
afire
up
the
lane
he
rushed
in
for
a
baby
although
he
was
only
a
boy
himself
and
he
had
the
narrowest
escape
we
have
got
his
hat
now
with
the
hole
burnt
in
it
shall
i
get
it
and
show
it
to
you
i
do
wish
it
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
as
he
persisted
in
his
course
towards
the
door
she
added
you
are
leaving
because
i
am
in
your
way
you
want
to
be
alone
while
you
read
the
paper
i
will
go
at
once
i
did
not
see
that
i
was
interrupting
you
and
she
rose
as
if
to
retreat
no
i
would
rather
be
interrupted
by
than
o
miss
garland
excuse
me
i
just
speak
to
father
in
the
mill
now
i
am
here
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
state
that
anne
whose
unquestionable
gentility
amid
somewhat
homely
surroundings
has
been
many
times
insisted
on
in
the
course
of
this
history
was
usually
the
reverse
of
a
woman
with
a
disposition
but
whether
from
pique
at
his
manner
or
from
wilful
adherence
to
a
course
rashly
resolved
on
or
from
coquettish
maliciousness
in
reaction
from
long
depression
or
from
any
other
thing
so
it
was
that
she
would
not
let
him
go
she
said
recalling
him
he
replied
timidly
bow
of
my
has
come
untied
has
it
not
she
turned
and
fixed
her
bewitching
glance
upon
him
the
bow
was
just
over
her
forehead
or
more
precisely
at
the
point
where
the
organ
of
comparison
merges
in
that
of
benevolence
according
to
the
phrenological
theory
of
gall
john
thus
brought
to
endeavoured
to
look
at
the
bow
in
a
skimming
fashion
so
as
to
avoid
dipping
his
own
glance
as
far
as
to
the
plane
of
his
interrogator
eyes
is
untied
he
said
drawing
back
a
little
she
came
nearer
and
asked
you
tie
it
for
me
please
as
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
nerved
himself
and
assented
as
her
head
only
reached
to
his
fourth
button
she
necessarily
looked
up
for
his
convenience
and
john
began
fumbling
at
the
bow
try
as
he
would
it
was
impossible
to
touch
the
ribbon
without
getting
his
finger
tips
mixed
with
the
curls
of
her
forehead
hand
shakes
ah
you
have
been
walking
fast
she
said
yes
you
almost
done
it
she
inquiringly
directed
her
gaze
upward
through
his
fingers
not
yet
he
faltered
in
a
warm
sweat
of
emotion
his
heart
going
like
a
flail
be
quick
please
i
will
miss
garland
is
a
very
good
fel
that
man
name
to
me
she
interrupted
john
was
silent
instantly
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
rustling
of
the
ribbon
till
his
hands
once
more
blundered
among
the
curls
and
then
touched
her
forehead
good
god
ejaculated
the
in
a
whisper
turning
away
hastily
to
the
and
resting
his
face
upon
his
hand
the
matter
john
said
she
ca
do
it
your
not
you
are
so
because
i
am
clumsy
and
never
could
tie
a
bow
are
clumsy
indeed
answered
anne
and
went
away
after
this
she
felt
injured
for
it
seemed
to
show
that
he
rated
her
happiness
as
of
meaner
value
than
bob
since
he
had
persisted
in
his
idea
of
giving
bob
another
chance
when
she
had
implied
that
it
was
her
wish
to
do
otherwise
could
miss
johnson
have
anything
to
do
with
his
firmness
an
opportunity
of
testing
him
in
this
direction
occurred
some
days
later
she
had
been
up
the
village
and
met
john
at
the
you
heard
the
news
matilda
johnson
is
going
to
be
married
to
young
derriman
anne
stood
with
her
back
to
the
sun
and
as
he
faced
her
his
features
were
searchingly
exhibited
there
was
no
change
whatever
in
them
unless
it
were
that
a
certain
light
of
interest
kindled
by
her
question
turned
to
complete
and
blank
indifference
as
times
go
it
is
not
a
bad
match
for
her
he
said
with
a
phlegm
which
was
hardly
that
of
a
lover
john
on
his
part
was
beginning
to
find
these
temptations
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
but
being
quartered
so
near
to
his
father
house
it
was
unnatural
not
to
visit
him
especially
when
at
any
moment
the
regiment
might
be
ordered
abroad
and
a
separation
of
years
ensue
and
as
long
as
he
went
there
he
could
not
help
seeing
her
the
year
changed
from
green
to
gold
and
from
gold
to
grey
but
little
change
came
over
the
house
of
loveday
during
the
last
twelve
months
bob
had
been
occasionally
heard
of
as
upholding
his
country
honour
in
denmark
the
west
indies
gibraltar
malta
and
other
places
about
the
globe
till
the
family
received
a
short
letter
stating
that
he
had
arrived
again
at
portsmouth
at
portsmouth
bob
seemed
disposed
to
remain
for
though
some
time
elapsed
without
further
intelligence
the
gallant
seaman
never
appeared
at
overcombe
then
on
a
sudden
john
learnt
that
bob
promotion
for
signal
services
rendered
was
to
be
an
accomplished
fact
the
at
once
walked
off
to
overcombe
and
reached
the
village
in
the
early
afternoon
not
one
of
the
family
was
in
the
house
at
the
moment
and
john
strolled
onwards
over
the
hill
towards
casterbridge
without
much
thought
of
direction
till
lifting
his
eyes
he
beheld
anne
garland
wandering
about
with
a
little
basket
upon
her
arm
at
first
john
blushed
with
delight
at
the
sweet
vision
but
recalled
by
his
conscience
the
blush
of
delight
was
at
once
mangled
and
slain
he
looked
for
a
means
of
retreat
but
the
field
was
open
and
a
soldier
was
a
conspicuous
object
there
was
no
escaping
her
was
kind
of
you
to
come
she
said
with
an
inviting
smile
was
quite
by
accident
he
answered
with
an
indifferent
laugh
thought
you
was
at
home
anne
blushed
and
said
nothing
and
they
rambled
on
together
in
the
middle
of
the
field
rose
a
fragment
of
stone
wall
in
the
form
of
a
gable
known
as
faringdon
ruin
and
when
they
had
reached
it
john
paused
and
politely
asked
her
if
she
were
not
a
little
tired
with
walking
so
far
no
particular
reply
was
returned
by
the
young
lady
but
they
both
stopped
and
anne
seated
herself
on
a
stone
which
had
fallen
from
the
ruin
to
the
ground
church
once
stood
here
observed
john
in
a
tone
i
have
often
shaped
it
out
in
my
mind
she
returned
where
i
sit
must
have
been
the
altar
this
standing
bit
of
wall
was
the
chancel
end
anne
had
been
adding
up
her
little
studies
of
the
character
and
was
surprised
to
find
how
the
brightness
of
that
character
increased
in
her
eyes
with
each
examination
a
kindly
and
gentle
sensation
was
again
aroused
in
her
here
was
a
neglected
heroic
man
who
loving
her
to
distraction
deliberately
doomed
himself
to
pensive
shade
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
standing
in
a
brother
way
the
altar
stood
here
hundreds
of
people
have
been
made
man
and
wife
just
there
in
past
times
she
said
with
calm
deliberateness
throwing
a
little
stone
on
a
spot
about
a
yard
westward
john
annihilated
another
tender
burst
and
replied
this
field
used
to
be
a
village
my
grandfather
could
call
to
mind
when
there
were
houses
here
but
the
squire
pulled
down
because
poor
folk
were
an
eyesore
to
him
you
know
john
what
you
once
asked
me
to
do
she
continued
not
accepting
the
digression
and
turning
her
eyes
upon
him
what
sort
of
way
the
matter
of
my
future
life
and
yours
am
afraid
i
do
loveday
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
for
a
moment
that
she
might
not
see
his
face
i
do
remember
he
said
at
last
in
a
dry
small
repressed
voice
need
i
say
more
is
it
sufficient
would
be
sufficient
answered
the
unhappy
man
she
looked
up
with
a
reproachful
smile
and
shook
her
head
summer
she
went
on
asked
me
ten
times
if
you
asked
me
once
i
am
older
now
much
more
of
a
woman
you
know
and
my
opinion
is
changed
about
some
people
especially
about
one
anne
anne
he
burst
out
as
racked
between
honour
and
desire
he
snatched
up
her
hand
the
next
moment
it
fell
heavily
to
her
lap
he
had
absolutely
relinquished
it
to
his
lips
have
been
thinking
lately
he
said
with
preternaturally
sudden
calmness
men
of
the
military
profession
ought
not
to
m
ought
to
be
like
paul
i
mean
john
pretending
religion
she
said
sternly
is
that
at
all
cried
the
miserable
have
had
a
letter
from
him
he
pulled
out
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
breast
it
he
promoted
he
a
lieutenant
and
appointed
to
a
sloop
that
only
cruises
on
our
own
coast
so
that
he
be
at
home
on
leave
half
his
time
he
be
a
gentleman
some
day
and
worthy
of
you
he
threw
the
letter
into
her
lap
and
drew
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
anne
jumped
up
from
her
seat
flung
away
the
letter
without
looking
at
it
and
went
hastily
on
john
did
not
attempt
to
overtake
her
picking
up
the
letter
he
followed
in
her
wake
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
but
though
anne
had
withdrawn
from
his
presence
thus
precipitately
she
never
thought
more
highly
of
him
in
her
life
than
she
did
five
minutes
afterwards
when
the
excitement
of
the
moment
had
passed
she
saw
it
all
quite
clearly
and
his
impressed
her
so
much
that
the
effect
was
just
the
reverse
of
what
he
had
been
aiming
to
produce
the
more
he
pleaded
for
bob
the
more
her
perverse
generosity
pleaded
for
john
the
crisis
had
come
with
what
results
she
had
not
foreseen
as
soon
as
the
reached
the
nearest
he
flung
himself
into
a
seat
and
wrote
wildly
to
bob
robert
i
write
these
few
lines
to
let
you
know
that
if
you
want
anne
garland
you
must
come
at
once
you
must
come
instantly
and
she
will
be
somebody
else
wants
her
and
she
wants
him
it
is
your
last
chance
in
the
opinion
of
faithful
brother
and
glad
to
hear
of
your
promotion
tell
me
the
day
and
i
meet
the
coach
xxxix
bob
loveday
struts
up
and
down
one
night
about
a
week
later
two
men
were
walking
in
the
dark
along
the
turnpike
road
towards
overcombe
one
of
them
with
a
bag
in
his
hand
said
the
taller
of
the
two
the
squareness
of
whose
shoulders
signified
that
he
wore
epaulettes
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
for
yourself
bob
i
have
done
all
i
can
but
thy
work
cut
out
i
can
tell
thee
would
have
run
such
a
risk
for
the
world
said
the
other
in
a
tone
of
ingenuous
contrition
see
jack
i
did
think
there
was
any
danger
knowing
you
was
taking
care
of
her
and
keeping
my
place
warm
for
me
i
did
hurry
myself
that
true
but
thinks
i
if
i
get
this
promotion
i
am
promised
i
shall
naturally
have
leave
and
then
i
go
and
see
all
gad
i
should
have
been
here
now
but
for
your
letter
little
think
what
risks
you
run
said
his
brother
try
to
make
up
for
lost
time
right
and
whatever
you
do
jack
do
say
a
word
about
this
other
girl
hang
the
girl
i
was
a
great
fool
i
know
still
it
is
over
now
and
i
am
come
to
my
senses
i
suppose
anne
never
caught
a
capful
of
wind
from
that
quarter
knows
all
about
it
said
john
seriously
by
george
then
i
ruined
said
bob
standing
in
the
road
as
if
he
meant
to
remain
there
all
night
what
i
meant
by
saying
it
would
be
a
hard
battle
for
returned
john
with
the
same
quietness
as
before
bob
sighed
and
moved
on
do
deserve
that
woman
he
cried
passionately
thumping
his
three
upper
ribs
with
his
fist
thought
as
much
myself
observed
john
with
a
dryness
which
was
almost
bitter
it
depends
on
how
behave
in
future
said
bob
taking
his
brother
hand
be
a
new
man
i
solemnly
swear
by
that
eternal
milestone
staring
at
me
there
that
never
look
at
another
woman
with
the
thought
of
marrying
her
whilst
that
darling
is
free
no
not
if
she
be
a
mermaiden
of
light
it
a
lucky
thing
that
i
slipped
in
on
the
quarterdeck
it
may
help
me
with
her
hey
may
with
her
mother
i
do
think
it
will
make
much
difference
with
anne
still
it
is
a
good
thing
and
i
hope
that
some
day
you
command
a
big
ship
bob
shook
his
head
are
scarce
but
i
afraid
my
luck
carry
me
so
far
as
that
she
ever
tell
you
that
she
mentioned
your
name
to
the
king
the
seaman
stood
still
again
he
said
did
such
a
thing
as
that
happen
in
heaven
name
john
described
in
detail
and
they
walked
on
lost
in
conjecture
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
house
the
returned
officer
of
the
navy
was
welcomed
with
acclamation
by
his
father
and
david
with
mild
approval
by
loveday
and
by
anne
not
at
all
that
discreet
maiden
having
carefully
retired
to
her
own
room
some
time
earlier
in
the
evening
bob
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
her
in
any
positive
manner
he
just
inquired
about
her
health
and
that
was
all
what
the
matter
with
thy
face
my
son
said
the
miller
staring
show
a
light
here
and
a
candle
was
thrust
against
bob
cheek
where
there
appeared
a
jagged
streak
like
the
geological
remains
of
a
lobster
that
where
that
rascally
frenchman
grenade
busted
and
hit
me
from
the
redoubtable
you
know
as
i
told
in
my
letter
a
word
did
i
tell
ah
no
i
meant
to
but
i
forgot
it
here
a
sort
of
dint
in
yer
forehead
too
what
do
that
mean
my
dear
boy
said
the
miller
putting
his
finger
in
a
chasm
in
bob
skull
was
done
in
the
indies
yes
that
was
rather
a
troublesome
chop
a
cutlass
did
it
i
should
have
told
but
i
found
make
my
letter
so
long
that
i
put
it
off
and
put
it
off
and
at
last
thought
it
was
worth
while
john
soon
rose
to
take
his
departure
all
up
with
me
and
her
you
see
said
bob
to
him
outside
the
door
not
even
going
to
see
me
a
little
said
the
it
was
easy
enough
on
the
night
of
the
arrival
in
the
midst
of
excitement
when
blood
was
warm
for
anne
to
be
resolute
in
her
avoidance
of
bob
loveday
but
in
the
morning
determination
is
apt
to
grow
invertebrate
rules
of
pugnacity
are
less
easily
acted
up
to
and
a
feeling
of
live
and
let
live
takes
possession
of
the
gentle
soul
anne
had
not
meant
even
to
sit
down
to
the
same
with
bob
but
when
the
rest
were
assembled
and
had
got
some
way
through
the
substantial
repast
which
was
served
at
this
hour
in
the
miller
house
anne
entered
she
came
silently
as
a
phantom
her
eyes
cast
down
her
cheeks
pale
it
was
a
good
long
walk
from
the
door
to
the
table
and
bob
made
a
full
inspection
of
her
as
she
came
up
to
a
chair
at
the
remotest
corner
in
the
direct
rays
of
the
morning
light
where
she
dumbly
sat
herself
down
it
was
altogether
different
from
how
she
had
expected
here
was
she
who
had
done
nothing
feeling
all
the
embarrassment
and
bob
who
had
done
the
wrong
feeling
apparently
quite
at
ease
speak
to
bob
wo
you
honey
said
the
miller
after
a
silence
to
meet
bob
like
this
after
an
absence
seemed
irregular
in
his
eyes
he
wish
me
to
she
replied
so
addressing
the
miller
that
no
part
scrap
or
outlying
beam
whatever
of
her
glance
passed
near
the
subject
of
her
remark
a
lieutenant
you
know
dear
said
her
mother
on
the
same
side
he
been
dreadfully
wounded
said
anne
turning
a
little
towards
the
false
one
at
which
bob
felt
it
to
be
time
for
him
to
put
in
a
spoke
for
himself
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
contritely
how
do
you
do
well
thank
you
he
extended
his
hand
she
allowed
him
to
take
hers
but
only
to
the
extent
of
a
niggardly
inch
or
so
at
the
same
moment
she
glanced
up
at
him
when
their
eyes
met
and
hers
were
again
withdrawn
the
hitch
between
the
two
younger
members
of
the
household
tended
to
make
the
breakfast
a
dull
one
bob
was
so
depressed
by
her
unforgiving
manner
that
he
could
not
throw
that
sparkle
into
his
stories
which
their
substance
naturally
required
and
when
the
meal
was
over
and
they
went
about
their
different
businesses
the
pair
resembled
the
two
dromios
in
seldom
or
never
being
thanks
to
anne
subtle
contrivances
both
in
the
same
room
at
the
same
time
this
kind
of
performance
repeated
itself
during
several
days
at
last
after
dogging
her
hither
and
thither
leaning
with
a
wrinkled
forehead
against
doorposts
taking
an
oblique
view
into
the
room
where
she
happened
to
be
picking
up
worsted
balls
and
getting
no
thanks
placing
a
splinter
from
the
victory
several
bullets
from
the
redoubtable
a
strip
of
the
flag
and
other
interesting
relics
carefully
labelled
upon
her
table
and
hearing
no
more
about
them
than
if
they
had
been
pebbles
from
the
nearest
brook
he
hit
upon
a
new
plan
to
avoid
him
she
frequently
sat
upstairs
in
a
window
overlooking
the
garden
lieutenant
loveday
carefully
dressed
himself
in
a
new
uniform
which
he
had
caused
to
be
sent
some
days
before
to
dazzle
admiring
friends
but
which
he
had
never
as
yet
put
on
in
public
or
mentioned
to
a
soul
when
arrayed
he
entered
the
sunny
garden
and
there
walked
slowly
up
and
down
as
he
had
seen
nelson
and
captain
hardy
do
on
the
but
keeping
his
right
shoulder
on
which
his
one
epaulette
was
fixed
as
much
towards
window
as
possible
but
she
made
no
sign
though
there
was
not
the
least
question
that
she
saw
him
at
the
end
of
he
went
in
took
off
his
clothes
and
gave
himself
up
to
doubt
and
the
best
tobacco
he
repeated
the
programme
on
the
next
afternoon
and
on
the
next
never
saying
a
word
within
doors
about
his
doings
or
his
notice
meanwhile
the
results
in
anne
chamber
were
not
uninteresting
she
had
been
looking
out
on
the
first
day
and
was
duly
amazed
to
see
a
naval
officer
in
full
uniform
promenading
in
the
path
finding
it
to
be
bob
she
left
the
window
with
a
sense
that
the
scene
was
not
for
her
then
from
mere
curiosity
peeped
out
from
behind
the
curtain
well
he
was
a
pretty
spectacle
she
admitted
relieved
as
his
figure
was
by
a
dense
mass
of
sunny
hedge
over
which
nasturtiums
climbed
in
wild
luxuriance
and
if
she
could
care
for
him
one
bit
which
she
could
his
form
would
have
been
a
delightful
study
surpassing
in
interest
even
its
splendour
on
the
memorable
day
of
their
visit
to
the
town
theatre
she
called
her
mother
loveday
came
promptly
it
is
nothing
said
anne
indifferently
that
bob
has
got
his
uniform
loveday
peeped
out
and
raised
her
hands
with
delight
he
has
not
said
a
word
to
us
about
it
what
a
lovely
epaulette
i
must
call
his
father
indeed
as
i
take
no
interest
in
him
i
shall
not
let
people
come
into
my
room
to
admire
him
you
called
me
said
her
mother
was
because
i
thought
you
liked
fine
clothes
it
is
what
i
care
for
notwithstanding
this
assertion
she
again
looked
out
at
bob
the
next
afternoon
when
his
footsteps
rustled
on
the
gravel
and
studied
his
appearance
under
all
the
varying
angles
of
the
sunlight
as
if
fine
clothes
and
uniforms
were
not
altogether
a
matter
of
indifference
he
certainly
was
a
splendid
gentlemanly
and
gallant
sailor
from
end
to
end
of
him
but
then
what
were
a
dashing
presentment
a
naval
rank
and
telling
scars
if
a
man
was
however
she
peeped
on
till
the
fourth
day
and
then
she
did
not
peep
the
window
was
open
she
looked
right
out
and
bob
knew
that
he
had
got
a
rise
to
his
bait
at
last
he
touched
his
hat
to
her
keeping
his
right
shoulder
forwards
and
said
miss
garland
with
a
smile
anne
replied
with
funereal
seriousness
and
the
acquaintance
thus
revived
led
to
the
interchange
of
a
few
words
at
at
which
loveday
nodded
with
satisfaction
but
anne
took
especial
care
that
he
should
never
meet
her
alone
and
to
insure
this
her
ingenuity
was
in
constant
exercise
there
were
so
many
nooks
and
windings
on
the
miller
rambling
premises
that
she
could
never
be
sure
he
would
not
turn
up
within
a
foot
of
her
particularly
as
his
thin
shoes
were
almost
noiseless
one
fine
afternoon
she
accompanied
molly
in
search
of
elderberries
for
making
the
family
wine
which
was
drunk
by
loveday
anne
and
anybody
who
could
not
stand
the
rougher
and
stronger
liquors
provided
by
the
miller
after
walking
rather
a
long
distance
over
the
down
they
came
to
a
grassy
hollow
where
in
knots
of
twos
and
threes
rose
from
an
uneven
bank
and
hung
their
heads
towards
the
south
black
and
heavy
with
bunches
of
fruit
the
charm
of
to
girls
is
enhanced
in
the
case
of
elderberries
by
the
inoffensive
softness
of
the
leaves
boughs
and
bark
which
makes
getting
into
the
branches
easy
and
pleasant
to
the
most
indifferent
climbers
anne
and
molly
had
soon
gathered
a
basketful
and
sending
the
servant
home
with
it
anne
remained
in
the
bush
picking
and
throwing
down
bunch
by
bunch
upon
the
grass
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
occupation
of
pulling
the
twigs
towards
her
and
the
rustling
of
their
leaves
so
filled
her
ears
that
it
was
a
great
surprise
when
on
turning
her
head
she
perceived
a
similar
movement
to
her
own
among
the
boughs
of
the
adjoining
bush
at
first
she
thought
they
were
disturbed
by
being
partly
in
contact
with
the
boughs
of
her
bush
but
in
a
moment
robert
loveday
face
peered
from
them
at
a
distance
of
about
a
yard
from
her
own
anne
uttered
a
little
indignant
recovered
herself
and
went
on
plucking
bob
thereupon
went
on
plucking
likewise
am
picking
elderberries
for
your
mother
said
the
lieutenant
at
last
humbly
i
see
i
happen
to
have
come
to
the
next
bush
to
yours
i
see
but
not
the
reason
why
anne
was
now
in
the
westernmost
branches
of
the
bush
and
bob
had
leant
across
into
the
eastern
branches
of
his
in
gathering
he
swayed
towards
her
back
again
forward
again
beg
pardon
he
said
when
a
further
swing
than
usual
had
taken
him
almost
in
contact
with
her
why
do
you
do
it
wind
rocks
the
bough
and
the
bough
rocks
me
she
expressed
by
a
look
her
opinion
of
this
statement
in
the
face
of
the
gentlest
breeze
and
bob
pursued
am
afraid
the
berries
will
stain
your
pretty
hands
wear
gloves
that
a
plan
i
should
never
have
thought
of
can
i
help
you
at
all
are
offended
that
what
that
means
she
said
will
you
shake
hands
anne
hesitated
then
slowly
stretched
out
her
hand
which
he
took
at
once
will
do
she
said
finding
that
he
did
not
relinquish
it
immediately
but
as
he
still
held
it
she
pulled
the
effect
of
which
was
to
draw
bob
swaying
person
bough
and
all
towards
her
and
herself
towards
him
am
afraid
to
let
go
your
hand
said
that
officer
if
i
do
your
spar
will
fly
back
and
you
will
be
thrown
upon
the
deck
with
great
violence
wish
you
to
let
me
go
he
accordingly
did
and
she
flew
back
but
did
not
by
any
means
fall
reminds
me
of
the
times
when
i
used
to
be
aloft
clinging
to
a
yard
not
much
bigger
than
this
in
the
and
thinking
about
you
i
could
see
you
in
my
fancy
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
or
some
other
woman
retorted
anne
haughtily
declared
bob
shaking
the
bush
for
emphasis
protest
that
i
did
not
think
of
anybody
but
you
all
the
time
we
were
dropping
down
channel
all
the
time
we
were
off
cadiz
all
the
time
through
battles
and
bombardments
i
seemed
to
see
you
in
the
smoke
and
thinks
i
if
i
go
to
davy
locker
what
will
she
do
did
think
that
when
you
landed
after
trafalgar
now
said
the
lieutenant
in
a
reasoning
tone
was
a
curious
thing
you
hardly
believe
it
maybe
but
when
a
man
is
away
from
the
woman
he
loves
best
in
the
port
world
i
mean
he
can
have
a
sort
of
temporary
feeling
for
another
without
disturbing
the
old
one
which
flows
along
under
the
same
as
ever
ca
believe
it
and
wo
said
anne
firmly
molly
now
appeared
with
the
empty
basket
and
when
it
had
been
filled
from
the
heap
on
the
grass
anne
went
home
with
her
bidding
loveday
a
frigid
adieu
the
same
evening
when
bob
was
absent
the
miller
proposed
that
they
should
all
three
go
to
an
upper
window
of
the
house
to
get
a
distant
view
of
some
rockets
and
illuminations
which
were
to
be
exhibited
in
the
town
and
harbour
in
honour
of
the
king
who
had
returned
this
year
as
usual
they
accordingly
went
upstairs
to
an
empty
attic
placed
chairs
against
the
window
and
put
out
the
light
anne
sitting
in
the
middle
her
mother
close
by
and
the
miller
behind
smoking
no
sign
of
any
pyrotechnic
display
was
visible
over
the
port
as
yet
and
loveday
passed
the
time
by
talking
to
the
miller
who
replied
in
monosyllables
while
this
was
going
on
anne
fancied
that
she
heard
some
one
approach
and
presently
felt
sure
that
bob
was
drawing
near
her
in
the
surrounding
darkness
but
as
the
other
two
had
noticed
nothing
she
said
not
a
word
all
at
once
the
swarthy
expanse
of
southward
sky
was
broken
by
the
blaze
of
several
rockets
simultaneously
ascending
from
different
ships
in
the
roads
at
the
very
same
moment
a
warm
mysterious
hand
slipped
round
her
own
and
gave
it
a
gentle
squeeze
dear
said
anne
with
a
sudden
start
away
nervous
you
are
child
to
be
startled
by
fireworks
so
far
off
said
loveday
never
saw
rockets
before
murmured
anne
recovering
from
her
surprise
loveday
presently
spoke
again
wonder
what
has
become
of
bob
anne
did
not
reply
being
much
exercised
in
trying
to
get
her
hand
away
from
the
one
that
imprisoned
it
and
whatever
the
miller
thought
he
kept
to
himself
because
it
disturbed
his
smoking
to
speak
another
batch
of
rockets
went
up
i
never
said
anne
in
a
tone
springing
in
her
chair
a
second
hand
had
with
the
rise
of
the
rockets
leapt
round
her
waist
girl
you
certainly
must
have
change
of
scene
at
this
rate
said
loveday
suppose
i
must
murmured
the
dutiful
daughter
for
some
minutes
nothing
further
occurred
to
disturb
anne
serenity
then
a
slow
quiet
came
from
the
obscurity
of
the
apartment
bob
how
long
have
you
been
there
inquired
loveday
long
said
the
lieutenant
coolly
heard
you
were
all
here
and
crept
up
quietly
not
to
disturb
ye
do
you
wear
heels
to
your
shoes
like
christian
people
and
not
creep
about
so
like
a
cat
it
keeps
your
floors
clean
to
go
true
meanwhile
anne
was
gently
but
firmly
trying
to
pull
bob
arm
from
her
waist
her
distressful
difficulty
being
that
in
freeing
her
waist
she
enslaved
her
hand
and
in
getting
her
hand
free
she
enslaved
her
waist
finding
the
struggle
a
futile
one
owing
to
the
invisibility
of
her
antagonist
and
her
wish
to
keep
its
nature
secret
from
the
other
two
she
arose
and
saying
that
she
did
not
care
to
see
any
more
felt
her
way
downstairs
bob
followed
leaving
loveday
and
his
wife
to
themselves
anne
he
began
when
he
had
got
down
and
saw
her
in
the
light
of
the
large
room
but
she
adroitly
passed
out
at
the
other
door
at
which
he
took
a
candle
and
followed
her
to
the
small
room
anne
do
let
me
speak
he
repeated
as
soon
as
the
rays
revealed
her
figure
but
she
passed
into
the
bakehouse
before
he
could
say
more
whereupon
he
perseveringly
did
the
same
looking
round
for
her
here
he
perceived
her
at
the
end
of
the
room
where
there
were
no
means
of
exit
whatever
anne
he
began
again
setting
down
the
candle
must
try
to
forgive
me
really
you
must
i
love
you
the
best
of
anybody
in
the
wide
wide
world
try
to
forgive
me
come
and
he
imploringly
took
her
hand
anne
bosom
began
to
surge
and
fall
like
a
small
tide
her
eyes
remaining
fixed
upon
the
floor
till
when
loveday
ventured
to
draw
her
slightly
towards
him
she
burst
out
crying
do
like
you
bob
i
do
she
suddenly
exclaimed
between
her
sobs
did
once
but
i
do
now
i
ca
i
ca
you
have
been
very
cruel
to
me
she
violently
turned
away
weeping
have
i
have
been
terribly
bad
i
know
answered
bob
by
her
grief
if
you
could
only
forgive
me
i
promise
that
i
never
do
anything
to
grieve
again
do
you
forgive
me
anne
anne
only
reply
was
crying
and
shaking
her
head
make
it
up
come
say
we
have
made
it
up
dear
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
still
keeping
her
eyes
buried
in
her
handkerchief
said
well
then
exclaimed
bob
with
sudden
determination
i
know
my
doom
and
whatever
you
hear
of
as
happening
to
me
mind
this
you
cruel
girl
that
it
is
all
your
causing
saying
this
he
strode
with
a
hasty
tread
across
the
room
into
the
passage
and
out
at
the
door
slamming
it
loudly
behind
him
anne
suddenly
looked
up
from
her
handkerchief
and
stared
with
round
wet
eyes
and
parted
lips
at
the
door
by
which
he
had
gone
having
remained
with
suspended
breath
in
this
attitude
for
a
few
seconds
she
turned
round
bent
her
head
upon
the
table
and
burst
out
weeping
anew
with
thrice
the
violence
of
the
former
time
it
really
seemed
now
as
if
her
grief
would
overwhelm
her
all
the
emotions
which
had
been
suppressed
bottled
up
and
concealed
since
bob
return
having
made
themselves
a
sluice
at
last
but
such
things
have
their
end
and
left
to
herself
in
the
large
vacant
old
apartment
she
grew
quieter
and
at
last
calm
at
length
she
took
the
candle
and
ascended
to
her
bedroom
where
she
bathed
her
eyes
and
looked
in
the
glass
to
see
if
she
had
made
herself
a
dreadful
object
it
was
not
so
bad
as
she
had
expected
and
she
went
downstairs
again
nobody
was
there
and
sitting
down
she
wondered
what
bob
had
really
meant
by
his
words
it
was
too
dreadful
to
think
that
he
intended
to
go
straight
away
to
sea
without
seeing
her
again
and
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
she
waited
anxiously
for
his
return
xl
a
call
on
business
her
suspense
was
interrupted
by
a
very
gentle
tapping
at
the
door
and
then
the
rustle
of
a
hand
over
its
surface
as
if
searching
for
the
latch
in
the
dark
the
door
opened
a
few
inches
and
the
alabaster
face
of
uncle
benjy
appeared
in
the
slit
squire
derriman
you
frighten
me
alone
he
asked
in
a
whisper
mother
and
loveday
are
somewhere
about
the
house
will
do
he
said
coming
forward
be
wherrited
out
of
my
life
and
i
have
thought
of
you
again
you
yourself
dear
anne
and
not
the
miller
if
you
will
only
take
this
and
lock
it
up
for
a
few
days
till
i
can
find
another
good
place
for
it
if
you
only
would
and
he
breathlessly
deposited
the
tin
box
on
the
table
obliged
to
dig
it
up
from
the
cellar
my
nephew
hath
a
scent
of
the
place
how
i
do
know
but
he
and
a
young
woman
he
met
with
are
searching
everywhere
i
worked
like
a
drawer
to
get
it
up
and
away
while
they
were
scraping
in
the
next
cellar
now
where
could
ye
put
it
dear
is
only
a
few
documents
and
my
will
and
such
like
you
know
poor
soul
o
me
i
worn
out
with
running
and
fright
put
it
here
till
i
can
think
of
a
better
place
said
anne
lifting
the
box
me
how
heavy
it
is
yes
said
uncle
benjy
hastily
box
is
iron
you
see
however
take
care
of
it
because
i
am
going
to
make
it
worth
your
while
ah
you
are
a
good
girl
anne
i
wish
you
was
mine
anne
looked
at
uncle
benjy
she
had
known
for
some
time
that
she
possessed
all
the
affection
he
had
to
bestow
do
you
wish
that
she
said
simply
do
ye
argue
with
me
where
d
put
the
coffer
said
anne
going
to
the
which
rose
as
a
flap
disclosing
a
boxed
receptacle
beneath
as
in
many
old
houses
very
well
for
the
present
he
said
dubiously
and
they
dropped
the
coffer
in
anne
locking
down
the
seat
and
giving
him
the
key
i
do
want
ye
to
be
on
my
side
for
nothing
he
went
on
never
did
now
did
i
this
is
for
you
he
handed
her
a
little
packet
of
paper
which
anne
turned
over
and
looked
at
curiously
always
meant
to
do
it
continued
uncle
benjy
gazing
at
the
packet
as
it
lay
in
her
hand
and
sighing
open
it
my
dear
i
always
meant
to
do
it
she
opened
it
and
found
twenty
new
guineas
snugly
packed
within
they
are
for
you
i
always
meant
to
do
it
he
said
sighing
again
you
owe
me
nothing
returned
anne
holding
them
out
say
it
cried
uncle
benjy
covering
his
eyes
away
well
if
you
want
but
put
away
dear
anne
they
are
for
you
because
you
have
kept
my
counsel
yes
they
are
for
you
he
went
a
few
steps
and
turning
back
added
anxiously
wo
spend
in
clothes
or
waste
in
fairings
or
ornaments
of
any
kind
my
dear
girl
will
not
said
anne
wish
you
would
have
them
no
said
uncle
benjy
rushing
off
to
escape
their
shine
but
he
had
got
no
further
than
the
passage
when
he
returned
again
you
wo
lend
to
anybody
or
put
into
the
bank
for
no
bank
is
safe
in
these
troublous
times
if
i
was
you
i
keep
them
as
they
be
and
not
spend
on
any
account
shall
i
lock
them
into
my
box
for
ye
said
she
and
the
farmer
rapidly
unlocked
the
opened
the
box
and
locked
them
in
much
the
best
plan
he
said
with
great
satisfaction
as
he
returned
the
keys
to
his
pocket
they
will
always
be
safe
you
see
and
you
wo
be
exposed
to
temptation
when
the
old
man
had
been
gone
a
few
minutes
the
miller
and
his
wife
came
in
quite
unconscious
of
all
that
had
passed
anne
anxiety
about
bob
was
again
uppermost
now
and
she
spoke
but
meagrely
of
old
visit
and
nothing
of
what
he
had
left
she
would
fain
have
asked
them
if
they
knew
where
bob
was
but
that
she
did
not
wish
to
inform
them
of
the
rupture
she
was
forced
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
had
somewhat
tried
his
patience
and
that
impulsive
men
had
been
known
to
do
dark
things
with
themselves
at
such
times
they
sat
down
to
supper
the
clock
ticked
rapidly
on
and
at
length
the
miller
said
is
later
than
usual
where
can
he
be
as
they
both
looked
at
her
she
could
no
longer
keep
the
secret
is
my
fault
she
cried
have
driven
him
away
what
shall
i
do
the
nature
of
the
quarrel
was
at
once
guessed
and
her
two
elders
said
no
more
anne
rose
and
went
to
the
front
door
where
she
listened
for
every
sound
with
a
palpitating
heart
then
she
went
in
then
she
went
out
and
on
one
occasion
she
heard
the
miller
say
wonder
what
hath
passed
between
bob
and
anne
i
hope
the
chap
will
come
home
just
about
this
time
light
footsteps
were
heard
without
and
bob
bounced
into
the
passage
anne
who
stood
back
in
the
dark
while
he
passed
followed
him
into
the
room
where
her
mother
and
the
miller
were
on
the
point
of
retiring
to
bed
candle
in
hand
have
kept
ye
up
i
fear
began
bob
cheerily
and
apparently
without
the
faintest
recollection
of
his
tragic
exit
from
the
house
the
truth
o
is
i
met
with
fess
derriman
at
the
duke
of
york
as
i
went
from
here
and
there
we
have
been
playing
put
ever
since
not
noticing
how
the
time
was
going
i
have
had
a
good
chat
with
the
fellow
for
years
and
years
and
really
he
is
an
out
and
out
good
comrade
a
regular
hearty
poor
fellow
he
been
very
badly
used
i
never
heard
the
rights
of
the
story
till
now
but
it
seems
that
old
uncle
of
his
treats
him
shamefully
he
has
been
hiding
away
his
money
so
that
poor
fess
might
not
have
a
farthing
till
at
last
the
young
man
has
turned
like
any
other
worm
and
is
now
determined
to
ferret
out
what
he
has
done
with
it
the
poor
young
chap
had
a
farthing
of
ready
money
till
i
lent
him
a
couple
of
guineas
a
thing
i
never
did
more
willingly
in
my
life
but
the
man
was
very
honourable
no
no
says
he
do
let
me
deprive
ye
he
going
to
marry
and
what
may
you
think
he
is
going
to
do
it
for
love
i
hope
said
anne
mother
money
i
suppose
since
he
so
short
said
the
miller
said
bob
he
has
been
badly
served
deuced
badly
served
by
a
woman
i
never
heard
of
a
more
heartless
case
in
my
life
the
poor
chap
would
mention
names
but
it
seems
this
young
woman
has
trifled
with
him
in
all
manner
of
cruel
ways
pushed
him
into
the
river
tried
to
steal
his
horse
when
he
was
called
out
to
defend
his
country
in
short
served
him
rascally
so
i
gave
him
the
two
guineas
and
said
now
let
drink
to
the
hussy
downfall
said
anne
having
approached
behind
him
bob
turned
and
saw
her
and
at
the
same
moment
and
loveday
discreetly
retired
by
the
other
door
it
peace
he
asked
tenderly
yes
she
anxiously
replied
did
mean
to
make
you
think
i
had
no
heart
at
this
bob
inclined
his
countenance
towards
hers
she
said
smiling
through
two
incipient
tears
as
she
drew
back
are
to
show
good
behaviour
for
six
months
and
you
must
promise
not
to
frighten
me
again
by
running
off
when
i
show
you
how
badly
you
have
served
me
am
yours
obedient
in
anything
cried
bob
am
i
pardoned
youth
is
foolish
and
does
a
woman
often
let
her
reasoning
in
favour
of
the
worthier
stand
in
the
way
of
her
perverse
desire
for
the
less
worthy
at
such
times
as
these
she
murmured
some
soft
words
ending
with
you
repent
it
would
be
superfluous
to
transcribe
bob
answer
footsteps
were
heard
without
begad
i
forgot
said
bob
waiting
out
there
for
a
light
friend
derriman
bob
i
have
to
explain
but
festus
had
by
this
time
entered
the
lobby
and
anne
with
a
hasty
rid
of
him
at
once
vanished
upstairs
here
she
waited
and
waited
but
festus
did
not
seem
inclined
to
depart
and
at
last
foreboding
some
collision
of
interests
from
bob
new
friendship
for
this
man
she
crept
into
a
storeroom
which
was
over
the
apartment
into
which
loveday
and
festus
had
gone
by
looking
through
a
in
the
floor
it
was
easy
to
command
a
view
of
the
room
beneath
this
being
unceiled
with
moulded
beams
and
rafters
festus
had
sat
down
on
the
hollow
and
was
continuing
the
statement
of
his
wrongs
he
only
knew
what
he
was
sitting
upon
she
thought
apprehensively
easily
he
could
tear
up
the
flap
lock
and
all
with
his
strong
arm
and
seize
upon
poor
uncle
benjy
possessions
but
he
did
not
appear
to
know
unless
he
were
acting
which
was
just
possible
after
a
while
he
rose
and
going
to
the
table
lifted
the
candle
to
light
his
pipe
at
the
moment
when
the
flame
began
diving
into
the
bowl
the
door
noiselessly
opened
and
a
figure
slipped
across
the
room
to
the
hastily
unlocked
it
withdrew
the
box
and
beat
a
retreat
anne
in
a
moment
recognized
the
ghostly
intruder
as
festus
derriman
uncle
before
he
could
get
out
of
the
room
festus
set
down
the
candle
and
turned
uncle
benjy
haw
haw
here
at
this
time
of
night
uncle
benjy
eyes
grew
paralyzed
and
his
mouth
opened
and
shut
like
a
frog
in
a
drought
the
action
producing
no
sound
have
we
got
here
a
tin
box
the
box
of
boxes
why
i
carry
it
for
uncle
i
am
going
home
thanky
festus
it
is
heavy
at
all
thanky
gasped
the
squireen
but
i
must
said
festus
pulling
at
the
box
let
him
have
it
bob
screamed
the
excited
anne
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
do
let
him
cried
the
uncle
a
plot
there
a
woman
at
the
window
waiting
to
help
him
anne
eyes
flew
to
the
window
and
she
saw
matilda
face
pressed
against
the
pane
bob
though
he
did
not
know
whence
anne
command
proceeded
obeyed
with
alacrity
pulled
the
box
from
the
two
relatives
and
placed
it
on
the
table
beside
him
look
here
hearties
what
the
meaning
o
this
he
said
trying
to
rob
me
of
all
i
possess
cried
the
old
man
strings
seem
as
if
they
were
going
crack
crack
crack
at
this
instant
the
miller
in
his
entered
the
room
having
got
thus
far
in
his
undressing
when
he
heard
the
noise
bob
and
festus
turned
to
him
to
explain
and
when
the
latter
had
had
his
say
bob
added
all
i
know
is
that
this
box
here
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
lay
it
upon
the
lid
for
emphasis
but
as
nothing
but
thin
air
met
his
fingers
where
the
box
had
been
he
turned
and
found
that
the
box
was
gone
uncle
benjy
having
vanished
also
festus
with
an
imprecation
hastened
to
the
door
but
though
the
night
was
not
dark
farmer
derriman
and
his
burden
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
on
the
bridge
festus
joined
a
shadowy
female
form
and
they
went
along
the
road
together
followed
for
some
distance
by
bob
lest
they
should
meet
with
and
harm
the
old
man
but
the
precaution
was
unnecessary
nowhere
on
the
road
was
there
any
sign
of
farmer
derriman
or
of
the
box
that
belonged
to
him
when
bob
the
house
anne
and
loveday
had
joined
the
miller
downstairs
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
learnt
who
had
been
the
heroine
of
festus
lamentable
story
with
many
other
particulars
of
that
yeoman
history
which
he
had
never
before
known
bob
swore
that
he
would
not
speak
to
the
traitor
again
and
the
family
retired
the
escape
of
old
derriman
from
the
annoyances
of
his
nephew
not
only
held
good
for
that
night
but
for
next
day
and
for
ever
just
after
dawn
on
the
following
morning
a
labouring
man
who
was
going
to
his
work
saw
the
old
farmer
and
landowner
leaning
over
a
rail
in
a
mead
near
his
house
apparently
engaged
in
contemplating
the
water
of
a
brook
before
him
drawing
near
the
man
spoke
but
uncle
benjy
did
not
reply
his
head
was
hanging
strangely
his
body
being
supported
in
its
erect
position
entirely
by
the
rail
that
passed
under
each
arm
on
it
was
found
that
uncle
benjy
poor
withered
heart
had
cracked
and
stopped
its
beating
from
damages
inflicted
on
it
by
the
excitements
of
his
life
and
of
the
previous
night
in
particular
the
unconscious
carcass
was
little
more
than
a
light
empty
husk
dry
and
fleshless
as
that
of
a
dead
heron
found
on
a
moor
in
january
but
the
tin
box
was
not
discovered
with
or
near
him
it
was
searched
for
all
the
week
and
all
the
month
the
was
dragged
quarries
were
examined
woods
were
threaded
rewards
were
offered
but
in
vain
at
length
one
day
in
the
spring
when
the
was
about
to
be
cleaned
throughout
the
of
anne
bedroom
concealing
a
yawning
had
to
be
taken
down
in
the
chasm
behind
it
stood
the
missing
of
farmer
derriman
many
were
the
conjectures
as
to
how
it
had
got
there
then
anne
remembered
that
on
going
to
bed
on
the
night
of
the
collision
between
festus
and
his
uncle
in
the
room
below
she
had
seen
mud
on
the
carpet
of
her
room
and
the
miller
remembered
that
he
had
seen
footprints
on
the
back
staircase
the
solution
of
the
mystery
seemed
to
be
that
the
late
uncle
benjy
instead
of
running
off
from
the
house
with
his
box
had
doubled
on
getting
out
of
the
front
door
entered
at
the
back
deposited
his
box
in
anne
chamber
where
it
was
found
and
then
leisurely
pursued
his
way
home
at
the
heels
of
festus
intending
to
tell
anne
of
his
trick
the
next
day
an
intention
that
was
for
ever
frustrated
by
the
stroke
of
death
derriman
solicitor
was
a
casterbridge
man
and
anne
placed
the
box
in
his
hands
uncle
benjy
will
was
discovered
within
and
by
this
testament
anne
queer
old
friend
appointed
her
sole
executrix
of
his
said
will
and
more
than
that
gave
and
bequeathed
to
the
same
young
lady
all
his
real
and
personal
estate
with
the
solitary
exception
of
five
small
freehold
houses
in
a
back
street
in
budmouth
which
were
devised
to
his
nephew
festus
as
a
sufficient
property
to
maintain
him
decently
without
affording
any
margin
for
extravagances
oxwell
hall
with
its
muddy
quadrangle
archways
mullioned
windows
cracked
battlements
and
garden
passed
with
the
rest
into
the
hands
of
anne
xli
john
marches
into
the
night
during
this
exciting
time
john
loveday
seldom
or
never
appeared
at
the
mill
with
the
recall
of
bob
in
which
he
had
been
sole
agent
his
mission
seemed
to
be
complete
one
before
anne
had
made
any
change
in
her
manner
of
living
on
account
of
her
unexpected
acquisition
lieutenant
bob
came
in
rather
suddenly
he
had
been
to
budmouth
and
announced
to
the
arrested
senses
of
the
family
that
the
th
dragoons
were
ordered
to
join
sir
arthur
wellesley
in
the
peninsula
these
tidings
produced
a
great
impression
on
the
household
john
had
been
so
long
in
the
neighbourhood
either
at
camp
or
in
barracks
that
they
had
almost
forgotten
the
possibility
of
his
being
sent
away
and
they
now
began
to
reflect
upon
the
singular
infrequency
of
his
calls
since
his
brother
return
there
was
not
much
time
however
for
reflection
if
they
wished
to
make
the
most
of
john
farewell
visit
which
was
to
be
paid
the
same
evening
the
departure
of
the
regiment
being
fixed
for
next
day
a
hurried
valedictory
supper
was
prepared
during
the
afternoon
and
shortly
afterwards
john
arrived
he
seemed
to
be
more
thoughtful
and
a
trifle
paler
than
of
old
but
beyond
these
traces
which
might
have
been
due
to
the
natural
wear
and
tear
of
time
he
showed
no
signs
of
gloom
on
his
way
through
the
town
that
morning
a
curious
little
incident
had
occurred
to
him
he
was
walking
past
one
of
the
churches
when
a
came
forth
the
bride
and
bridegroom
being
matilda
and
festus
derriman
at
sight
of
the
the
yeoman
had
glared
triumphantly
matilda
on
her
part
had
winked
at
him
slily
as
much
as
to
say
but
what
she
meant
heaven
knows
the
did
not
trouble
himself
to
think
and
passed
on
without
returning
the
mark
of
confidence
with
which
she
had
favoured
him
soon
after
john
arrival
at
the
mill
several
of
his
friends
dropped
in
for
the
same
purpose
of
bidding
adieu
they
were
mostly
the
men
who
had
been
entertained
there
on
the
occasion
of
the
regiment
advent
on
the
down
when
anne
and
her
mother
were
coaxed
in
to
grace
the
party
by
their
superior
presence
and
their
gallant
manners
were
such
as
to
make
them
interesting
visitors
now
as
at
all
times
for
it
was
a
period
when
romance
had
not
so
greatly
faded
out
of
military
life
as
it
has
done
in
these
days
of
short
service
heterogeneous
mixing
and
transient
campaigns
when
the
esprit
de
corps
was
strong
and
long
experience
stamped
noteworthy
professional
characteristics
even
on
rank
and
file
while
the
miller
visitors
had
the
additional
advantage
of
being
picked
men
they
could
not
stay
so
long
as
on
that
earlier
and
more
cheerful
occasion
and
the
final
adieus
were
spoken
at
an
early
hour
it
was
no
mere
playing
at
departure
as
when
they
had
gone
to
exonbury
barracks
and
there
was
a
warm
and
prolonged
shaking
of
hands
all
round
wish
the
poor
fellows
said
bob
to
anne
who
had
not
come
forward
for
that
purpose
like
the
rest
are
going
away
and
would
like
to
have
your
good
word
she
then
shyly
advanced
and
every
man
felt
that
he
must
make
some
pretty
speech
as
he
shook
her
by
the
hand
may
you
remember
us
as
long
as
it
makes
ye
happy
and
forget
us
as
soon
as
it
makes
ye
sad
said
sergeant
brett
health
wealth
and
long
life
to
ye
said
wills
taking
her
hand
from
brett
trust
to
meet
ye
again
as
the
wife
of
a
worthy
man
said
trumpeter
buck
drink
your
health
throughout
the
campaign
and
so
said
jones
raising
her
hand
to
his
lips
three
others
followed
with
similar
remarks
to
each
of
which
anne
blushingly
replied
as
well
as
she
could
wishing
them
a
prosperous
voyage
easy
conquest
and
a
speedy
return
but
alas
for
that
battles
and
skirmishes
advances
and
retreats
fevers
and
fatigues
told
hard
on
anne
gallant
friends
in
the
coming
time
of
the
seven
upon
whom
these
wishes
were
bestowed
five
including
the
were
dead
men
within
the
few
following
years
and
their
bones
left
to
moulder
in
the
land
of
their
campaigns
john
lingered
behind
when
the
others
were
outside
expressing
a
final
farewell
to
his
father
bob
and
loveday
he
came
to
anne
who
remained
within
i
thought
you
were
going
to
look
in
again
before
leaving
she
said
gently
i
find
i
can
not
said
anne
holding
his
right
hand
in
both
hers
must
tell
you
something
you
were
wise
in
not
taking
me
at
my
word
that
day
i
was
greatly
mistaken
about
myself
gratitude
is
not
love
though
i
wanted
to
make
it
so
for
the
time
you
do
call
me
thoughtless
for
what
i
did
dear
anne
cried
john
with
more
gaiety
than
truthfulness
let
yourself
be
troubled
what
happens
is
for
the
best
soldiers
love
here
and
there
who
knows
that
you
wo
hear
of
my
attentions
to
some
spanish
maid
before
a
month
is
gone
by
is
the
way
of
us
you
know
a
soldier
heart
is
not
worth
a
week
purchase
ha
ha
goodbye
anne
felt
the
expediency
of
his
manner
received
the
affectation
as
real
and
smiled
her
reply
not
knowing
that
the
adieu
was
for
evermore
then
with
a
tear
in
his
eye
he
went
out
of
the
door
where
he
bade
farewell
to
the
miller
loveday
and
bob
who
said
at
parting
all
right
jack
my
dear
fellow
after
a
coaxing
that
would
have
been
enough
to
win
three
ordinary
englishwomen
five
french
and
ten
mulotters
she
has
day
agreed
to
bestow
her
hand
upon
me
at
the
end
of
six
months
jack
the
candle
held
by
his
father
shed
its
waving
light
upon
john
face
and
uniform
as
with
a
farewell
smile
he
turned
on
the
doorstone
backed
by
the
black
night
and
in
another
moment
he
had
plunged
into
the
darkness
the
ring
of
his
smart
step
dying
away
upon
the
bridge
as
he
joined
his
and
went
off
to
blow
his
trumpet
till
silenced
for
ever
upon
one
of
the
bloody
of
spain
