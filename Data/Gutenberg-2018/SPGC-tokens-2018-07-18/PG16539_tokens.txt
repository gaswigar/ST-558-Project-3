conclusion
introduction
an
abundance
of
literature
exists
on
the
subject
of
the
rhine
and
its
legends
but
with
few
exceptions
the
works
on
it
which
are
accessible
to
peoples
are
antiquated
in
spirit
and
verbiage
and
their
authors
have
been
content
to
accept
the
first
version
of
such
legends
and
traditions
as
came
their
way
without
submitting
them
to
any
critical
examination
it
is
claimed
for
this
book
that
much
of
its
matter
was
collected
on
the
spot
or
that
at
least
most
of
the
tales
here
presented
were
perused
in
other
works
at
the
scene
of
the
occurrences
related
this
volume
is
thus
something
more
than
a
mere
compilation
and
when
it
is
further
stated
that
only
the
most
characteristic
and
original
versions
and
variants
of
the
many
tales
here
given
have
gained
admittance
to
the
collection
its
value
will
become
apparent
it
is
of
course
no
easy
task
to
infuse
a
spirit
of
originality
into
matter
which
has
already
achieved
such
a
measure
of
celebrity
as
have
these
wild
and
wondrous
tales
of
rhineland
but
it
is
hoped
that
the
treatment
to
which
these
stories
have
been
subjected
is
not
without
a
novelty
of
its
own
one
circumstance
may
be
alluded
to
as
characteristic
of
the
manner
of
their
treatment
in
this
work
in
most
english
books
on
rhine
legend
the
tales
themselves
are
presented
in
a
form
so
brief
succinct
and
uninspiring
as
to
rob
them
entirely
of
that
mysterious
glamour
lacking
which
they
become
mere
material
by
which
to
add
to
and
illustrate
the
the
absence
of
the
romantic
spirit
in
most
english
and
american
compilations
dealing
with
the
rhine
legends
is
noteworthy
and
in
writing
this
book
the
intention
has
been
to
supply
this
striking
defect
by
retaining
as
much
of
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
so
dear
to
the
german
heart
as
will
convey
to
the
reader
a
true
conception
of
the
spirit
of
german
legend
but
it
is
not
contended
that
because
greater
space
and
freedom
of
narrative
scope
than
is
usual
has
been
taken
by
the
author
the
volume
would
not
prove
itself
an
acceptable
companion
upon
a
voyage
on
rhine
waters
undertaken
in
holiday
times
of
peace
indeed
every
attempt
has
been
made
so
to
arrange
the
legends
that
they
will
illustrate
a
rhine
journey
from
sea
to
manner
in
which
the
majority
of
visitors
to
germany
will
make
the
to
this
end
the
tales
have
been
marshalled
in
such
form
that
a
reader
sitting
on
the
deck
of
a
rhine
steamer
may
be
able
to
peruse
the
legends
relating
to
the
various
localities
in
their
proper
order
as
he
passes
them
there
are
included
however
several
tales
relating
to
places
which
can
not
be
viewed
from
the
deck
of
a
steamer
but
which
may
be
visited
at
the
cost
of
a
short
inland
excursion
these
are
such
as
from
their
celebrity
could
not
be
omitted
from
any
work
on
the
legends
of
rhineland
but
they
are
few
in
number
the
historical
development
folklore
poetry
and
art
of
the
have
been
dealt
with
in
a
special
introductory
chapter
the
history
of
the
rhine
basin
is
a
complicated
and
uneven
one
chiefly
consisting
in
the
rapid
and
perplexing
rise
and
fall
of
dynasties
and
the
alternate
confiscation
of
one
or
both
banks
of
the
devoted
stream
to
the
empires
of
france
or
germany
but
the
evolution
of
a
reasoned
narrative
has
been
attempted
from
this
chaotic
material
and
so
far
as
the
author
is
aware
it
is
the
only
one
existing
in
english
the
folklore
and
romance
elements
in
rhine
legend
have
been
carefully
examined
and
the
best
poetic
material
upon
the
storied
river
has
been
critically
collected
and
reviewed
to
those
who
may
one
day
visit
the
rhine
it
is
hoped
that
the
volume
may
afford
a
suitable
introduction
to
a
fascinating
field
of
travel
while
to
such
as
have
already
viewed
its
glories
it
may
serve
to
renew
old
associations
and
awaken
cherished
memories
of
a
river
without
peer
or
parallel
in
its
wealth
of
story
its
boundless
mystery
and
the
hold
which
it
has
exercised
upon
all
who
have
lingered
by
the
paths
that
wind
among
its
mysterious
promontories
and
strands
chapter
and
historical
there
are
many
rivers
whose
celebrity
is
of
much
greater
antiquity
than
that
of
the
rhine
the
nile
and
the
ganges
are
intimately
associated
with
the
early
history
of
civilization
and
the
mysterious
beginnings
of
wisdom
the
tiber
is
eloquent
of
that
vanished
empire
which
was
the
first
to
carry
the
torch
of
advancement
into
the
dark
places
of
barbarian
europe
the
name
of
the
jordan
is
sacred
to
thousands
as
that
first
heard
in
infancy
and
linked
with
lives
and
memories
divine
but
universal
as
is
the
fame
of
these
rivers
none
of
them
has
awakened
in
the
breasts
of
the
dwellers
on
their
banks
such
a
fervent
devotion
such
intense
enthusiasm
or
such
a
powerful
patriotic
appeal
as
has
the
rhine
at
once
the
river
the
frontier
and
the
palladium
of
the
german
folk
the
magic
of
the
rhine
but
the
appeal
is
wider
for
the
rhine
is
peculiarly
the
home
of
a
legendary
mysticism
almost
unique
those
whose
lives
are
spent
in
their
creation
and
interpretation
know
that
song
and
legend
have
a
particular
affinity
for
water
hogg
the
friend
of
shelley
was
wont
to
tell
how
the
bright
eyes
of
his
comrade
would
dilate
at
the
sight
of
even
a
puddle
by
the
roadside
has
water
a
hypnotic
attraction
for
certain
minds
be
that
as
it
may
there
has
crystallized
round
the
great
waterways
of
the
world
a
traditionary
lore
which
preserves
the
thought
and
feeling
of
the
past
and
retains
many
a
circumstance
of
wonder
and
marvel
from
olden
epochs
which
the
modern
world
could
ill
have
spared
varied
and
valuable
as
are
the
traditional
tales
of
other
streams
none
possess
that
colour
of
intensity
and
mystery
that
spell
of
ancient
profundity
which
belong
to
the
legends
of
the
rhine
in
perusing
these
we
feel
our
very
souls
plunged
in
darkness
as
that
of
the
carven
gloom
of
some
gothic
cathedral
or
the
cimmerian
depths
of
some
ancient
forest
unpierced
by
it
is
the
teutonic
mystery
which
has
us
in
its
grip
a
thing
as
readily
recognizable
as
the
celtic
glamour
or
the
egyptian
thing
of
the
shadows
of
eld
stern
ancient
of
a
ponderous
fantasy
instinct
with
the
spirit
of
nature
of
dwarfs
elves
kobolds
erlkings
the
wraiths
and
shades
of
forest
and
flood
of
mountain
and
mere
of
castled
height
and
swift
whirlpool
the
denizens
of
the
deep
valleys
and
mines
the
bergs
and
heaths
of
this
great
province
of
romance
this
rich
satrapy
of
faëry
a
land
of
legend
nowhere
is
legend
so
thickly
strewn
as
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
each
step
is
eloquent
of
tradition
each
town
village
and
valley
no
hill
no
castle
but
has
its
story
true
or
legendary
the
teuton
is
easily
the
master
in
the
art
of
conserving
local
lore
as
one
speeds
down
the
broad
breast
of
this
wondrous
river
gay
with
summer
and
flushed
with
the
laughter
of
early
vineyards
so
close
is
the
network
of
legend
that
the
swiftly
read
or
spoken
tale
of
one
locality
is
scarce
over
ere
the
traveller
is
confronted
by
another
it
is
a
surfeit
of
romance
an
inexhaustible
hoard
of
the
matter
of
marvel
this
noble
stream
with
its
wealth
of
tradition
has
made
such
a
powerful
impression
upon
the
national
imagination
that
it
has
become
intimate
in
the
soul
of
the
people
and
commands
a
reverence
and
affection
which
is
not
given
by
any
other
modern
nation
to
its
greatest
and
most
characteristic
river
the
englishman
has
only
a
mitigated
pride
in
the
thames
as
a
great
commercial
asset
or
its
metropolitan
borders
once
passed
a
river
of
peculiarly
restful
character
the
frenchman
evinces
no
very
great
enthusiasm
toward
the
seine
and
if
there
are
many
spanish
songs
about
the
guadalquivir
the
dons
have
been
content
to
retain
its
arabic
name
but
what
german
heart
does
not
thrill
at
the
name
of
the
rhine
what
german
cheek
does
not
flush
at
the
sound
of
that
mighty
which
tells
of
his
determination
to
preserve
the
river
of
his
fathers
at
the
cost
of
his
best
blood
nay
what
man
of
patriotic
temperament
but
feels
a
responsive
chord
awake
within
him
at
the
thought
of
that
majestic
song
so
stern
so
strong
in
armour
vibrant
with
the
clang
of
swords
instinct
with
the
universal
accord
of
a
united
people
to
those
who
have
heard
it
sung
by
multitudinous
voices
to
the
accompaniment
of
golden
harps
and
silver
trumpets
it
is
a
thing
which
can
never
be
forgotten
this
that
is
at
once
a
hymn
of
union
a
song
of
the
deepest
love
of
country
a
defiance
and
an
intimation
of
resistance
to
the
death
the
song
of
the
how
potent
die
wacht
am
rhein
is
to
stir
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
the
fatherland
is
proven
abundantly
by
an
apposite
story
regarding
the
great
bismarck
the
of
blood
and
the
scene
is
the
german
reichstag
and
the
time
is
that
curious
juncture
in
history
when
the
germans
having
realized
that
union
is
strength
were
beginning
to
weld
together
the
petty
kingdoms
and
duchies
of
which
their
mighty
empire
was
once
composed
gradually
this
task
was
becoming
accomplished
and
meanwhile
germany
grew
eager
to
assert
her
power
in
europe
wherefore
her
rulers
commenced
to
create
a
vast
army
but
bismarck
was
not
satisfied
and
in
his
eyes
safety
was
still
unassured
so
he
appealed
to
the
reichstag
to
augment
largely
their
armaments
the
deputies
looked
at
him
askance
for
a
vast
army
meant
ruinous
taxation
even
von
moltke
and
von
roon
shook
their
heads
well
aware
though
they
were
that
a
great
european
conflict
might
break
out
at
any
time
and
in
short
proposal
was
met
by
a
determined
negative
from
the
whole
house
mein
gott
he
cried
holding
out
his
hands
in
a
superb
gesture
of
despair
mein
gott
but
these
soldiers
we
must
his
hearers
still
demurred
reminding
him
that
the
people
far
and
near
were
groaning
under
the
weight
of
taxation
and
assuring
him
that
this
could
not
possibly
be
increased
when
he
suddenly
changed
his
despairing
gesture
for
a
martial
attitude
and
with
sublime
eloquence
recited
the
lines
braust
ein
ruf
wie
donnerhall
wie
schwertgeklirr
und
wogenprall
zum
rhein
zum
rhein
zum
deutschen
rhein
wer
will
die
strömes
hüter
sein
lieb
vaterland
magst
ruhig
sein
fest
steht
und
treu
die
wacht
am
the
effect
was
magical
the
entire
house
resounded
with
cheers
and
the
most
unbounded
enthusiasm
prevailed
and
ere
the
members
dispersed
they
had
told
bismarck
he
might
have
not
ten
thousand
but
a
hundred
thousand
soldiers
such
was
the
power
of
association
awakened
by
this
famous
hymn
such
the
spell
it
is
capable
of
exercising
on
german
hearers
topography
of
the
rhine
ere
we
set
sail
upon
the
dark
sea
of
legend
before
us
it
is
necessary
that
like
prudent
mariners
we
should
know
whence
and
whither
we
are
faring
to
this
end
it
will
be
well
that
we
should
glance
briefly
at
the
topography
of
the
great
river
we
are
about
to
explore
and
that
we
should
sketch
rapidly
the
most
salient
occurrences
in
the
strange
and
varied
pageant
of
its
history
in
order
that
we
may
the
better
appreciate
the
wondrous
tales
of
worldwide
renown
which
have
found
birth
on
its
banks
although
the
most
german
of
rivers
the
rhine
does
not
run
its
entire
course
through
german
territory
but
takes
its
rise
in
switzerland
and
finds
the
sea
in
holland
for
no
less
than
miles
it
flows
through
swiss
country
rising
in
the
mountains
of
the
canton
of
grisons
and
irrigates
every
canton
of
the
alpine
republic
save
that
of
geneva
indeed
it
waters
over
square
miles
of
swiss
territory
in
the
flow
of
its
two
main
branches
the
nearer
rhine
and
the
farther
rhine
which
unite
at
reichenau
near
coire
the
nearer
rhine
issues
at
the
height
of
over
feet
from
the
glaciers
of
the
rheinwaldhorn
group
and
flows
for
some
miles
first
in
a
direction
through
the
rheinwald
valley
then
northward
through
the
schams
valley
by
way
of
the
via
mala
gorge
and
tomleschg
valley
and
so
to
reichenau
where
it
is
joined
by
its
sister
stream
the
farther
rhine
the
latter
rising
in
the
little
alpine
lake
of
toma
near
the
pass
of
gotthard
flows
in
a
direction
to
reichenau
the
nearer
rhine
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
more
important
branch
though
the
farther
rhine
is
the
longer
by
some
seven
miles
from
reichenau
the
rhine
flows
to
coire
and
thence
northward
to
the
lake
of
constance
receiving
on
its
way
two
tributaries
the
landquart
and
the
ill
both
on
the
right
bank
indeed
from
source
to
sea
the
rhine
receives
a
vast
number
of
tributaries
amounting
with
their
branches
to
over
leaving
the
lake
of
constance
at
the
town
of
that
name
the
river
flows
westward
to
basel
having
as
the
principal
towns
on
its
banks
constance
schaffhausen
waldshut
laufenburg
säckingen
rheinfelden
and
basel
not
far
from
the
town
of
schaffhausen
the
river
precipitates
itself
from
a
height
of
feet
in
three
leaps
forming
the
famous
falls
of
the
rhine
at
coblentz
a
strange
thing
happens
for
at
this
place
the
river
receives
the
waters
of
the
aar
swollen
by
the
reuss
and
the
limmat
and
of
greater
volume
than
the
stream
in
which
it
loses
itself
it
is
at
basel
that
the
rhine
taking
a
northward
trend
enters
germany
by
this
time
it
has
made
a
descent
of
nearly
feet
and
has
traversed
about
a
third
of
its
course
between
basel
and
mainz
it
flows
between
the
mountains
of
the
black
forest
and
the
vosges
the
distance
between
which
forms
a
shallow
valley
of
some
width
here
and
there
it
is
islanded
and
its
expanse
averages
about
feet
the
taunus
mountains
divert
it
at
mainz
where
it
widens
and
it
flows
westward
for
about
twenty
miles
but
at
bingen
it
once
more
takes
its
course
northward
and
enters
a
narrow
valley
where
the
enclosing
hills
look
down
sheer
upon
the
water
it
is
in
this
valley
probably
one
of
the
most
romantic
in
the
world
that
we
find
the
legendary
lore
of
the
river
packed
in
such
richness
that
every
foot
of
its
banks
has
its
place
in
tradition
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
portion
of
the
rhine
is
wanting
in
natural
beauty
here
are
situated
some
of
its
sunniest
vineyards
its
most
wildly
romantic
heights
and
its
most
picturesque
ruins
this
part
of
its
course
may
be
said
to
end
at
the
siebengebirge
or
mountains
where
the
river
again
widens
and
the
banks
become
more
bare
and
uninteresting
passing
bonn
and
cologne
the
bareness
of
the
landscape
is
remarkable
after
the
variety
of
that
from
which
we
have
just
emerged
and
henceforward
the
river
takes
on
what
may
be
called
a
appearance
after
entering
holland
it
divides
into
two
branches
the
waal
flowing
to
the
west
and
uniting
with
the
maas
the
smaller
branch
to
the
right
is
still
called
the
rhine
and
throws
off
another
branch
the
yssel
which
flows
into
the
zuider
zee
once
more
the
river
bifurcates
into
insignificant
streams
one
of
which
is
called
the
kromme
rijn
and
beyond
utrecht
and
under
the
name
of
the
oude
rijn
or
old
rhine
it
becomes
so
stagnant
that
it
requires
the
aid
of
a
canal
to
drain
it
into
the
sea
anciently
the
rhine
at
this
part
of
its
course
was
an
abounding
stream
but
by
the
ninth
century
the
sands
at
katwijk
had
silted
it
up
and
it
was
only
in
the
beginning
of
last
century
that
its
way
to
the
sea
was
made
clear
the
sunken
city
more
than
six
centuries
ago
stavoren
was
one
of
the
chief
commercial
towns
of
holland
its
merchants
traded
with
all
parts
of
the
world
and
brought
back
their
ships
laden
with
rich
cargoes
and
the
city
became
ever
more
prosperous
the
majority
of
the
people
of
stavoren
were
and
as
their
wealth
increased
they
became
luxurious
and
dissipated
each
striving
to
outdo
the
others
in
the
magnificence
of
their
homes
and
the
extravagance
of
their
hospitality
many
of
their
houses
we
are
told
were
like
the
palaces
of
princes
built
of
white
marble
furnished
with
the
greatest
sumptuousness
and
decorated
with
the
costliest
hangings
and
the
rarest
statuary
but
says
the
legend
of
all
the
stavoren
folk
there
was
none
wealthier
than
young
richberta
this
maiden
owned
a
fleet
of
the
finest
of
the
city
and
loved
to
ornament
her
palace
with
the
rich
merchandise
which
these
brought
from
foreign
ports
with
all
her
jewels
and
gold
and
silver
treasures
however
richberta
was
not
happy
she
gave
gorgeous
banquets
to
the
other
of
the
place
each
more
magnificent
than
the
last
not
because
she
received
any
pleasure
from
thus
dispensing
hospitality
but
because
she
desired
to
create
envy
and
astonishment
in
the
breasts
of
her
guests
on
one
occasion
while
such
a
feast
was
in
progress
richberta
was
informed
that
a
stranger
was
waiting
without
who
was
desirous
of
speaking
with
her
when
she
was
told
that
the
man
had
come
all
the
way
from
a
distant
land
simply
to
admire
her
wonderful
treasures
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
the
maiden
was
highly
flattered
and
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
admitted
without
delay
an
aged
and
decrepit
man
clad
in
a
picturesque
eastern
costume
was
led
into
the
room
and
richberta
bade
him
be
seated
at
her
side
he
expected
to
receive
from
the
young
lady
the
symbol
of
and
salt
but
no
such
common
fare
was
to
be
found
on
her
was
rich
and
luxurious
food
the
stranger
seated
himself
in
silence
at
length
he
began
to
talk
he
had
travelled
in
many
lands
and
now
he
told
of
his
changing
fortunes
in
these
countries
always
drawing
a
moral
from
his
all
things
earthly
were
evanescent
as
the
dews
of
morning
the
company
listened
attentively
to
the
discourse
of
the
sage
all
that
is
but
their
hostess
who
was
angry
and
disappointed
that
he
had
said
no
word
of
the
wealth
and
magnificence
displayed
in
her
palace
the
rich
fare
on
her
table
and
all
the
signs
of
luxury
with
which
he
was
surrounded
at
length
she
could
conceal
her
chagrin
no
longer
and
asked
the
stranger
directly
whether
he
had
ever
seen
such
splendour
in
his
wanderings
as
that
he
now
beheld
me
she
said
there
to
be
found
in
the
courts
of
your
eastern
kings
such
rare
treasures
as
these
of
mine
replied
the
sage
have
no
pearls
and
rich
embroideries
to
match
thine
nevertheless
there
is
one
thing
missing
from
your
board
and
that
the
best
and
most
valuable
of
all
earthly
in
vain
richberta
begged
that
he
would
tell
her
what
that
most
precious
of
treasures
might
be
he
answered
all
her
inquiries
in
an
evasive
manner
and
at
last
when
her
question
could
no
longer
be
evaded
he
rose
abruptly
and
left
the
room
and
seek
as
she
might
richberta
could
find
no
trace
of
her
mysterious
visitor
richberta
strove
to
discover
the
meaning
of
the
old
words
she
was
possessed
greater
treasures
than
any
in
stavoren
at
a
time
when
that
city
was
among
the
wealthiest
in
yet
she
lacked
the
most
precious
of
treasures
the
memory
of
the
words
galled
her
pride
and
excited
her
curiosity
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
in
vain
she
asked
the
wise
men
of
her
priests
and
read
her
the
riddle
of
the
mysterious
traveller
none
could
name
a
treasure
that
was
not
already
hers
in
her
anxiety
to
obtain
the
precious
thing
whatever
it
might
be
richberta
sent
all
her
ships
to
sea
telling
the
captain
of
each
not
to
return
until
he
had
found
some
treasure
that
she
did
not
already
possess
the
vessels
were
victualled
for
seven
years
so
that
the
mariners
might
have
ample
time
in
which
to
pursue
their
quest
so
their
commander
sent
one
division
of
the
fleet
to
the
east
another
to
the
west
while
he
left
his
own
vessel
to
the
hazard
of
the
winds
letting
it
drift
wheresoever
the
fates
decreed
his
ship
as
well
as
the
others
was
laden
heavily
with
provisions
and
during
the
first
storm
they
encountered
it
was
necessary
to
cast
a
considerable
portion
of
the
food
overboard
so
that
the
ship
might
right
itself
as
it
was
the
remaining
provisions
were
so
damaged
by
the
that
they
rotted
in
a
few
days
and
became
unfit
for
food
a
pestilence
would
surely
follow
the
use
of
such
unwholesome
stuff
and
consequently
the
entire
cargo
of
bread
had
to
be
cast
into
the
sea
the
commander
saw
his
crew
ravaged
by
the
dreaded
scurvy
suffering
from
the
lack
of
bread
then
only
did
he
begin
to
perceive
the
real
meaning
of
the
words
the
most
valuable
of
all
earthly
treasures
was
not
the
pearls
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
gold
or
silver
from
the
heart
of
the
mountains
nor
the
rich
spices
of
the
indies
the
most
common
of
all
products
that
which
was
to
be
found
in
every
country
which
flourished
in
every
clime
on
which
the
lives
of
millions
was
the
greatest
treasure
and
its
name
having
reached
this
conclusion
the
commander
of
fleet
set
sail
for
a
baltic
port
where
he
took
on
board
a
cargo
of
corn
and
returned
immediately
to
stavoren
richberta
was
astonished
and
delighted
to
see
that
he
had
achieved
his
purpose
so
soon
and
bade
him
tell
her
of
what
the
treasure
consisted
which
he
had
brought
with
him
the
commander
thereupon
recounted
his
storm
the
throwing
overboard
of
their
store
of
bread
and
the
consequent
sufferings
of
the
told
how
he
at
length
discovered
what
was
the
greatest
treasure
on
earth
the
priceless
possession
which
the
stranger
had
looked
for
in
vain
at
her
rich
board
it
was
bread
he
said
simply
and
the
cargo
he
had
brought
home
was
corn
richberta
was
beside
herself
with
passion
when
she
had
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
speak
she
asked
him
which
side
of
the
ship
did
you
take
in
the
cargo
the
right
side
he
replied
she
exclaimed
angrily
order
you
to
cast
it
into
the
sea
from
the
left
it
was
a
cruel
decision
stavoren
like
every
other
city
had
its
quota
of
poor
families
and
these
were
in
much
distress
at
the
time
many
of
them
dying
from
sheer
starvation
the
cargo
of
corn
would
have
provided
bread
for
them
throughout
the
whole
winter
and
the
commander
urged
richberta
to
reconsider
her
decision
as
a
last
resort
he
sent
the
barefooted
children
of
the
city
to
her
thinking
that
their
mute
misery
would
move
her
to
alleviate
their
distress
and
give
them
the
shipload
of
corn
but
all
was
in
vain
richberta
remained
adamantine
and
in
full
view
of
the
starving
multitude
she
had
the
precious
cargo
cast
into
the
sea
but
the
curses
of
the
despairing
people
had
their
effect
far
down
in
the
bed
of
the
sea
the
grains
of
corn
germinated
and
a
harvest
of
bare
stalks
grew
until
it
reached
the
surface
of
the
water
the
shifting
quicksands
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
were
bound
together
by
the
overspreading
stalks
into
a
mighty
which
rose
above
the
surface
in
front
of
the
town
of
stavoren
no
longer
were
the
able
to
enter
the
harbour
for
it
was
blocked
by
the
impassable
bank
nay
instead
of
finding
refuge
there
many
a
ship
was
dashed
to
pieces
by
the
fury
of
the
breakers
and
stavoren
became
a
place
of
to
the
mariner
all
the
wealth
and
commerce
of
this
proud
city
were
at
an
end
richberta
herself
whose
wanton
act
had
raised
the
had
her
ships
wrecked
there
one
by
one
and
was
reduced
to
begging
for
bread
in
the
city
whose
wealthiest
inhabitant
she
had
once
been
then
perhaps
she
could
appreciate
the
words
of
the
old
traveller
that
bread
was
the
greatest
of
earthly
treasures
at
last
the
ocean
dashing
against
the
huge
mound
with
fury
burst
through
the
dyke
which
richberta
had
raised
overwhelmed
the
town
and
buried
it
for
ever
under
the
waves
and
now
the
mariner
sailing
on
the
zuider
zee
passes
above
the
engulfed
city
and
sees
with
wonderment
the
towers
and
spires
of
the
historical
sketch
like
other
the
rhine
has
attracted
to
its
banks
a
succession
of
races
of
widely
divergent
origin
celt
teuton
slav
and
roman
have
contested
for
the
territories
which
it
waters
and
if
the
most
enduring
of
these
races
has
finally
achieved
dominion
over
the
fairest
in
europe
who
shall
say
that
it
has
emerged
from
the
struggle
as
a
homogeneous
people
having
absorbed
none
of
the
blood
of
those
with
whom
it
strove
for
the
lordship
of
this
valley
he
would
indeed
be
a
courageous
ethnologist
who
would
suggest
a
purely
germanic
origin
for
the
rhine
race
as
the
historical
period
dawns
upon
middle
europe
we
find
the
rhine
basin
in
the
possession
of
a
people
of
celtic
blood
as
in
britain
and
france
this
folk
has
left
its
indelible
mark
upon
the
countryside
in
a
wealth
of
embodying
its
characteristic
titles
for
flood
village
and
hill
in
such
prefixes
and
terminations
as
magh
brig
dun
and
etc
we
espy
the
influence
of
celtic
occupants
and
maguntiacum
or
mainz
and
borbetomagus
or
worms
are
examples
of
that
idiom
which
has
indelibly
starred
the
map
of
western
europe
prehistoric
miners
the
remains
of
this
people
which
are
unearthed
from
beneath
the
superincumbent
strata
of
their
teutonic
successors
in
the
country
show
them
to
have
been
typical
of
their
race
like
their
kindred
in
britain
they
had
successfully
exploited
the
mineral
treasures
of
the
country
and
their
skill
as
miners
is
eloquently
upheld
by
the
mute
witness
of
by
which
are
found
the
once
busy
bronze
hammer
and
the
apparatus
of
the
speaking
of
the
slow
but
steady
upon
which
the
foundation
of
civilization
arose
there
was
scarcely
a
mineral
beneath
the
loamy
soil
which
masked
the
metalliferous
rock
which
they
did
not
work
from
schönebeck
to
dürkheim
lies
an
immense
bed
of
salt
and
this
the
celtic
population
of
the
district
dug
and
condensed
by
aid
of
fires
fed
by
huge
logs
cut
from
the
giant
trees
of
the
vast
and
mysterious
forests
which
have
from
time
immemorial
shadowed
the
whole
existence
of
the
german
race
the
salt
moulded
or
cut
into
blocks
was
transported
to
gaul
as
an
article
of
commerce
but
the
celts
of
the
rhine
achieved
distinction
in
other
arts
of
life
for
their
pottery
weapons
and
jewellery
will
bear
comparison
with
those
of
prehistoric
peoples
in
any
part
of
europe
as
has
been
remarked
at
the
dawn
of
history
we
find
the
rhine
celts
everywhere
in
full
retreat
before
the
rude
and
more
virile
teutons
they
lingered
latterly
about
the
moselle
and
in
the
district
of
eifel
offering
a
desperate
resistance
to
the
onrushing
hordes
of
germanic
warriors
in
all
likelihood
they
were
outnumbered
if
not
outmatched
in
skill
and
valour
and
they
melted
away
before
the
savage
ferocity
of
their
foes
probably
seeking
asylum
with
their
kindred
in
gaul
probably
the
teutonic
tribes
had
already
commenced
to
apply
pressure
to
the
celtic
inhabitants
of
in
the
fourth
century
before
the
christian
era
as
was
their
wont
they
displaced
the
original
possessors
of
the
soil
as
much
by
a
process
of
infiltration
as
by
direct
conquest
the
waves
of
emigration
seem
to
have
come
from
rhaetia
and
pannonia
folk
who
were
in
a
somewhat
lower
condition
of
barbarism
than
the
race
whose
territory
they
usurped

and
irritable

and
fretted

barrier

imposed

and
several
other
classic
authors
speak
of
the
remarkable
uniformity
in
their
appearance
how
they
were
all
tall
and
handsome
with
fierce
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
humboldt
remarks
the
tendency
we
all
have
to
see
only
the
single
type
in
a
strange
foreign
people
and
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
differences
among
them
thus
some
of
us
think
sheep
all
alike
but
the
shepherd
knows
better
and
many
think
all
chinamen
are
alike
whereas
they
differ
in
reality
quite
as
much
as
we
do
or
rather
more
but
with
respect
to
the
ancient
germans
there
certainly
was
among
them
one
very
prevalent
form
of
head
and
even
the
varieties
of
feature
which
occur
among
the
example
on
marcus
seem
to
oscillate
round
one
central
type
the
type
is
the
graverow
type
of
ecker
the
hohberg
type
of
his
and
rutimeyer
the
swiss
anatomists
in
it
the
head
is
long
narrow

from
to
in
as
high

higher

the
upper

apt
to
be

in
germany
persons
with
these
characters
have
almost
always
light
eyes
and

this
graverow
type
is
almost
exclusively
what
is
found
in
the
of
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
centuries

part
of
the
first
century
face
of
the
country
though
in
some
parts
varied
presents
a
cheerless
scene
covered
with
the
gloom
of

with
marshes
toward
the
boundaries
of
gaul
moist
and
swampy
on
the
side

but
of
an
and
deprived
by
nature
of
the
usual
growth
and
ornament
of
the
head
the
pride
of
a
german
consists
in
the
number
of
his
flocks
and
herds
they
are
his
only
riches
and
in
these
he
places
his
chief
delight
gold
and
silver
are
withheld
from
them
is
it
by
the
favour
or
the
wrath
of
heaven
i
do
not
however
mean
to
assert
that
in
germany
there
are
no
veins
of
precious
ore
for
who
has
been
a
miner
in
these
regions
certain
it
is
they
do
not
enjoy
the
possession
and
use
of
those
metals
with
our
sensibility
there
are
indeed
silver
vessels
to
be
seen
among
them
but
they
were
presents
to
their
chiefs
or
ambassadors
the
germans
regard
them
in
no
better
light
than
common
earthenware
it
is
however
observable
that
near
the
borders
of
the
empire
the
inhabitants
set
a
value
upon
gold
and
silver
finding
them
subservient
to
the
purposes
of
commerce
the
roman
coin
is
known
in
those
parts
and
some
of
our
specie
is
not
only
current
but
in
request
in
places
more
remote
the
simplicity
of
ancient
manners
still
prevails
commutation
of
property
is
their
only
traffic
where
money
passes
in
the
way
of
barter
our
old
coin
is
the
most
acceptable
particularly
that
which
is
indented
at
the
edge
or
stamped
with
the
impression
of
a
chariot
and
two
horses
called
the
serrati
and
bigati
silver
is
preferred
to
gold
not
from
caprice
or
fancy
but
because
the
inferior
metal

ancient
german
weapons
does
not
abound
in
germany
if
we
may
judge
from
the
weapons
in
general
use
swords
and
large
lances
are
seldom
seen
the
soldier
grasps
his
javelin
or
as
it
is
called
in
their
language
his
instrument
tipped
with
a
short
and
narrow
piece
of
iron
sharply
pointed
and
so
commodious
that
as
occasion
requires
he
can
manage
it
in
close
engagement

in

combat
with
this
and
a
shield
the
cavalry
are
completely
armed
the
infantry

an
addition
of
missive

carries
a
considerable
number
and
being
naked
or
at

not
encumbered
by
his
light
mantle
he
throws
his

to

distance
almost
incredible
a
german
pays
no
attention
to
the
ornament
of
his
person
his
shield
is
the
object
of
his
care
and
this
he
decorates
with
the
liveliest
colours
breastplates
are
uncommon
in
a
whole
army
you
will
not
see
more
than
one
or

their

have
neither
swiftness
nor

nor
are
they

to
the
various
evolutions
of
the
roman
cavalry
to
advance
in
a
direct
line
or

suddenly
to

is
the
whole
of
their

and
this
they
perform
in
so
compact
a
body
that
not
one
is
thrown
out
of
his
rank
according
to
the
best
estimate
the
infantry
comprise
the
national
strength
and
for
that
reason
always
fight
intermixed
with
the

the
flower
of
their
youth
able
by
their
vigour
and
activity
to
keep
pace
with
the
movements
of
the

are
selected
for
this
purpose
and
placed
in
the
front
of
the
lines
the
number
of
these
is
fixed
and
certain
each
canton
sends
a
hundred
from
that
circumstance
called
hundreders
by
the

the

was
at

only
it

the

in
the

provided
you
return

military
skill
not
fear
or
cowardice
in
the
most
fierce
and
obstinate
engagement
even
when
the
fortune
of
the
day
is
doubtful
they
make
it
a
point
to
carry
off
their
slain
to
abandon
their

is
a
flagitious
crime
the
person
guilty
of
it

interdicted
from

and
excluded
from

many
who
survived
their
honour
on
the
day
of
battle
have
closed
a
life
of
ignominy
by
a
teutonic
customs
the
kings
of
this
rude
but
warlike
folk
were
elected
by
the
suffrages
of
the
nobility
and
their
leaders
in
battle
as
was
inevitable
with
such
a
people
were
chosen
by
reason
of
their
personal
prowess
the
legal
functions
were
exercised
by
the
priesthood
and
punishments
were
thus
held
to
be
sanctioned
by
the
gods
among
this
barbaric
people
the
female
sex
was
held
as
absolutely
sacred
the
functions
of
wife
and
mother
being
accounted
among
the
highest
possible
to
humanity
and
we
observe
in
ancient
accounts
of
the
race
that
typically
teutonic
conception
of
the
woman
as
seer
or
prophetess
which
so
strongly
colours
early
germanic
literature
women
indeed
in
later
times
when
christianity
had
nominally
conquered
paganism
remained
as
the
sole
conservators
of
the
ancient
teutonic
lore
and
in
the
curtained
recesses
of
halls
whiled
away
the
white
hours
of
winter
by
the
painful
spelling
out
of
runic
characters
and
the
practice
of
arts
which
they
were
destined
to
convey
from
the
priests
of
odin
and
thor
to
the
witches
of
medieval
days
costume
of
the
early
teuton
the
personal
appearance
of
these
barbarians
was
as
rude
and
simple
as
were
their
manners
says
tacitus
clothing
in
use
is
a
loose
mantle
made
fast
with
a
clasp
or
when
that

not
be
had
with
a

naked
in
other

they
loiter
away
whole

by

fireside
the

a
garment
not
indeed
displayed
and
flowing
like
the
parthians
or
the
people
of
sarmatia
but
drawn
so
tight
that
the
form
of
the
limbs
is
palpably
expressed
the
skins
of
wild
animals
are
also
much
in
use
near
the
frontier
on
the
borders
of
the
rhine
the
inhabitants
wear
them
but
with
an
air
of
neglect
that
shows
them
altogether
indifferent
about
the
choice
the
people
who
live
more
remote
near
the
northern
seas
and
have
not
acquired
by
commerce
a
taste
for
apparel
are
more
curious
in
the
selection
they
choose
particular
beasts
and
having
stripped
off
the
furs
clothe
themselves
with
the
spoil
decorated
with
spots
or
fragments
taken
from
the
skins
of
fish
that
swim
the
ocean
as
yet
unexplored
by
the
romans
in
point
of
dress
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
sexes
except
that
the
garment
of
the
women
is
frequently
made
of
linen
adorned
with
purple
stains
but
without
sleeves
leaving
the
arms
and
part
of
the
bosom
the
germanic
tribes
it
is
also
from
tacitus
that
we
glean
what
were
the
names
and
descriptions
of
those
tribes
who
occupied
the
territory
adjacent
to
the
rhine
the
basin
of
the
river
between
strassburg
and
mainz
was
inhabited
by
the
tribacci
nemetes
and
vangiones
further
south
by
the
matiacci
near
wiesbaden
and
the
ubii
in
the
district
of
cologne
further
north
lay
the
sugambri
and
the
delta
of
the
river
in
the
low
countries
was
the
seat
of
the
brave
batavii
from
whom
came
the
bulk
of
the
legions
by
means
of
which
agricola
obtained
a
footing
in
far
caledonia
before
the
roman
invasion
of
their
territories
these
tribes
were
constantly
engaged
in
internecine
warfare
a
condition
of
affairs
not
to
be
marvelled
at
when
we
learn
that
at
their
tribal
councils
the
warrior
regarded
as
an
inspired
speaker
was
he
who
was
most
powerfully
affected
by
the
potations
in
which
all
habitually
indulged
to
an
extent
which
seemed
to
the
cultured
roman
as
bestial
in
the
last
degree
the
constant
bearing
of
arms
added
to
their
frequent
addiction
to
powerful
liquors
also
seemed
to
render
the
germanic
warriors
quarrelsome
to
excess
and
to
provoke
intertribal
strife
the
romans
in
the
rhine
country
caesar
is
the
first
roman
writer
to
give
us
any
historical
data
concerning
the
peoples
who
inhabited
the
basin
of
the
rhine
he
conquered
the
tribes
on
the
left
bank
and
was
followed
a
generation
or
so
later
by
augustus
who
established
numerous
fortified
posts
on
the
river
but
the
romans
never
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
firm
occupancy
of
the
right
bank
their
chief
object
in
colonizing
the
rhine
territory
was
to
form
an
effective
barrier
between
themselves
and
the
restless
barbarian
tribes
of
the
teutonic
north
the
constant
menace
of
whose
invasion
lay
as
a
canker
at
the
heart
of
rich
and
fruitful
italy
with
the
terror
of
a
barbarian
inroad
ever
before
their
eyes
the
cohorts
of
the
imperial
city
constructed
a
formidable
vallum
or
earthen
wall
from
the
vicinity
of
linz
to
regensburg
on
the
danube
a
distance
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
for
the
purpose
of
raising
a
barrier
against
the
advance
of
the
warlike
men
of
the
north
they
further
planted
a
colony
of
veterans
in
the
black
forest
neighbourhood
in
order
that
invasion
might
be
resisted
from
that
side
but
as
the
empire
began
to
exhibit
signs
of
decadence
the
barbarians
were
quick
to
recognize
the
symptoms
of
weakness
in
those
who
barred
their
advance
to
the
wealthy
south
the
objective
of
their
dreams
hurled
themselves
against
the
boundary
now
rendered
feeble
by
reason
of
the
withdrawal
of
its
most
experienced
defenders
and
despite
a
stern
resistance
flooded
the
rich
valleys
of
the
rhine
swamped
the
colonies
on
the
left
bank
which
had
imbibed
roman
civilization
and
made
all
wholly
teutonic
the
rebellion
of
the
barbarians
this
was
however
a
process
of
years
and
by
no
means
a
speedy
conquest
the
closing
years
of
reign
were
clouded
by
a
general
rising
of
the
rhine
peoples
quintilius
varus
an
officer
who
had
been
entrusted
with
the
government
of
the
provinces
beyond
the
rhine
proved
totally
unequal
to
curbing
the
bolder
spirits
among
the
germans
who
under
their
chief
arminius
boldly
challenged
the
forces
of
this
officer
arminius
belonged
to
the
cherusci
he
had
served
with
the
german
horsemen
in
the
rhenish
armies
and
was
conversant
with
the
latin
language
observing
that
half
at
least
of
the
roman
forces
were
on
leave
he
incited
the
tribes
of
lower
saxony
to
revolt
the
weak
varus
who
had
underestimated
the
influence
of
arminius
attempted
to
quell
the
rising
but
without
success
and
the
bank
of
the
river
was
the
scene
of
a
wholesale
slaughter
varus
completely
losing
his
nerve
attempted
to
separate
the
cavalry
from
the
infantry
and
endeavoured
to
escape
with
three
squadrons
of
the
former
but
the
germans
surrounded
them
and
after
a
struggle
of
three
days
the
roman
army
was
annihilated
the
news
of
this
disaster
prompted
the
aged
emperor
to
dispatch
his
son
tiberius
to
suppress
what
appeared
to
be
a
general
rising
of
the
north
the
rhenish
tribes
however
were
too
wary
to
meet
the
powerful
force
now
sent
against
them
in
the
open
field
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
tiberius
left
in
peace
occupied
himself
in
strengthening
the
rhine
fortifications
he
was
soon
after
recalled
to
rome
to
assume
the
purple
on
the
death
of
augustus
germanicus
who
had
taken
command
of
the
legions
on
the
rhine
became
conscious
of
discontent
among
the
soldiers
who
threatened
to
carry
him
into
rome
and
thrust
him
into
the
seat
of
empire
but
he
soothed
the
passions
of
his
soldiers
by
gifts
and
promises
a
road
was
opened
from
the
rhine
into
the
german
hinterland
and
germanicus
led
his
army
into
the
heart
of
a
country
of
which
he
knew
but
little
to
avenge
the
disasters
of
the
varian
legions
the
forest
folk
eluded
the
invading
host
which
now
sought
to
return
to
headquarters
but
ere
they
had
completed
the
journey
they
were
assailed
and
suffered
a
severe
reverse
numerous
revolts
occurred
among
the
gaulish
legions
in
the
service
of
the
roman
empire
in
germany
but
the
stubborn
and
trained
resistance
of
the
romans
no
less
than
the
inexperience
of
the
gauls
led
to
a
cessation
of
hostilities
the
secret
of
roman
power
in
rhenish
territory
lay
in
the
circumstance
that
the
two
great
elements
of
german
nationality
the
nobility
and
the
priesthood
were
becoming
romanized
but
a
rude
culture
was
beginning
to
blossom
and
a
desire
arose
among
the
barbarians
for
unity
they
wished
to
band
themselves
into
a
nation
the
franks
and
goths
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
rome
during
the
reigns
of
valerian
and
gallienus
were
the
franks
the
alemanni
and
the
goths
whose
action
finally
decided
the
conquest
of
the
rhenish
provinces
of
rome
the
name
frank
or
freedman
was
given
to
a
confederacy
formed
in
by
the
old
inhabitants
of
the
lower
rhine
and
the
weser
it
consisted
of
the
chauci
the
cherusci
and
the
chatti
and
of
several
other
tribes
of
greater
or
less
renown
the
romans
foresaw
the
power
of
this
formidable
union
and
by
the
presence
of
the
emperor
himself
and
his
son
endeavoured
to
stem
the
invasion
which
threatened
their
suzerainty
the
franks
fond
of
liberty
and
imbued
with
a
passion
for
conquest
crossed
the
rhine
in
spite
of
its
strong
fortifications
and
carried
their
devastations
to
the
foot
of
the
pyrenees
for
twelve
years
gallienus
attempted
to
stem
the
torrent
thus
freed
the
alemanni
who
belonged
to
the
upper
rhine
between
the
main
and
the
danube
were
composed
of
many
tribes
the
most
important
of
which
was
the
celebrated
suevi
this
people
who
had
now
become
a
permanent
nation
threatened
the
empire
with
an
invasion
which
was
checked
with
difficulty
after
they
had
fought
their
way
to
the
gates
of
rome
itself
in
aurelian
completely
subdued
the
rhenish
peoples
numbers
of
whom
were
dragged
in
his
triumph
through
the
streets
of
rome
but
after
his
brief
reign
the
old
condition
of
things
reasserted
itself
until
probus
who
assumed
the
purple
in
restored
peace
and
order
by
the
construction
of
a
massive
wall
between
the
rhine
and
the
danube
over
two
hundred
miles
in
length
the
barbarians
were
driven
beyond
the
river
which
had
hitherto
served
as
a
even
past
the
elbe
and
the
neckar
finally
however
the
internecine
strife
in
the
imperial
city
forced
the
romans
to
return
thence
and
rhineland
was
abandoned
to
the
will
of
its
inhabitants
the
early
christian
centuries
are
full
of
the
sound
of
conflict
in
the
fourth
century
the
principal
tribes
in
western
germany
were
the
franks
and
the
alemanni
the
former
of
whom
maintained
a
constant
strife
with
the
saxons
who
pressed
heavily
upon
their
rear
the
franks
occupied
the
lower
portion
of
the
river
near
to
its
mouth
whilst
the
alemanni
dwelt
on
the
portion
to
the
bounds
of
helvetia
and
switzerland
at
this
period
great
racial
upheavals
appear
to
have
been
taking
place
further
east
by
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
the
saxons
seem
to
have
penetrated
almost
to
the
rhine
where
the
franks
were
now
supreme
the
merovingians
in
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
arose
the
powerful
dynasty
of
the
merovingians
one
of
the
most
picturesque
royal
houses
in
the
roll
of
history
in
their
records
we
see
the
clash
of
barbarism
with
advancement
the
bizarre
tints
of
a
unequalled
in
rude
magnificence
giant
shadows
of
forgotten
kings
stalk
across
the
canvas
their
royal
purple
intermingling
with
the
shaggy
fell
of
the
bear
and
wolf
one
chilperic
a
subtle
grammarian
and
the
inventor
of
new
alphabetic
symbols
is
yet
the
most
implacable
of
his
race
the
murderer
of
his
wife
the
heartless
slayer
of
hundreds
to
whom
human
life
is
as
that
of
cattle
skilled
in
the
administration
of
poison
a
picturesque
others
are
weaklings
fainéants
but
one
the
most
dread
woman
in
frankish
history
fredegonda
the
queen
of
chilperic
towers
above
all
in
this
masque
of
slaughter
and
treachery
tradition
makes
claim
that
andernach
was
the
cradle
of
the
merovingian
dynasty
in
proof
of
this
are
shown
the
extensive
ruins
of
the
palace
of
these
ancient
frankish
kings
merovig
from
whom
the
race
derived
its
name
was
said
to
be
the
son
of
clodio
but
legend
relates
far
otherwise
in
name
and
origin
he
was
literally
a
child
of
the
rhine
his
father
being
a
who
seized
the
wife
of
clodio
while
bathing
in
that
river
in
time
she
gave
birth
to
a
child
more
monster
than
man
the
spine
being
covered
with
bristles
fingers
and
toes
webbed
eyes
covered
with
a
film
and
thighs
and
legs
horny
with
large
shining
scales
clodio
though
aware
of
the
real
paternity
of
this
creature
adopted
it
as
his
own
son
as
did
king
minos
in
the
case
of
the
minotaur
giving
him
the
name
merovig
from
his
piscatory
origin
on
death
the
succeeded
to
the
throne
and
from
him
sprang
a
long
line
of
sovereigns
worthless
and
imbecile
for
the
most
part
childeric
the
son
and
successor
of
merovig
enraged
his
people
to
such
a
degree
by
his
excesses
that
they
drove
him
from
throne
and
country
one
friend
alone
remained
to
him
winomadus
who
having
no
female
relations
to
suffer
by
the
attentions
did
not
find
the
friendship
so
irksome
as
others
indeed
had
been
a
partner
in
his
licentious
pleasures
he
undertook
to
watch
over
the
interests
of
childeric
during
his
enforced
absence
in
thuringia
at
the
court
of
basium
king
of
that
country
the
franks
had
elected
aegidius
a
roman
general
to
the
sovereignty
over
them
but
as
he
proved
himself
no
better
than
childeric
whom
they
had
deposed
they
once
more
essayed
to
choose
another
ruler
this
was
made
known
to
childeric
through
his
friend
winomadus
he
rapidly
returned
to
the
shores
of
the
rhine
and
reinforcing
his
following
as
he
proceeded
on
his
march
appeared
before
andernach
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
force
composed
of
many
of
his
former
subjects
together
with
thuringian
auxiliaries
the
people
of
andernach
unable
to
resist
this
overwhelming
argument
again
accepted
childeric
as
their
king
basina
the
sorceress
while
in
thuringia
childeric
had
seduced
the
affections
of
basina
the
queen
of
his
protector
when
he
regained
his
throne
he
induced
her
to
leave
her
husband
and
made
her
his
queen
basina
was
a
sorceress
one
who
could
divine
the
future
and
also
bestow
the
gift
upon
others
through
this
she
gained
great
influence
over
childeric
who
desired
to
see
and
know
what
fate
had
in
store
for
himself
and
his
race
basina
agreed
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
one
night
at
the
midnight
hour
they
climbed
together
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
behind
andernach
there
she
bade
him
stand
and
look
out
over
the
plain
while
she
performed
her
magical
operations
after
some
lengthy
incantations
she
bade
him
look
well
and
tell
her
what
he
saw
in
a
voice
the
king
replied
see
a
great
light
upon
the
plain
although
all
around
is
blackest
he
paused
then
at
her
bidding
proceeded
again
see
an
immense
concourse
of
wild
lion
the
tiger
the
spotted
pard
the
elephant
the
they
are
coming
this
will
devour
us
and
he
turned
to
flee
in
great
terror
basina
bade
him
stay
in
peremptory
tones
and
again
to
look
out
over
the
plain
in
a
voice
of
alarm
he
cried
out
see
bears
and
wolves
jackals
and
hyenas
heaven
help
us
the
others
are
all
gone
heedless
of
his
terror
the
queen
bade
him
look
again
and
for
the
last
time
tell
her
what
he
saw
see
now
dogs
and
cats
and
little
creatures
of
all
kinds
but
there
is
one
small
than
a
commands
them
all
ah
he
is
eating
them
them
after
as
he
looked
the
light
the
plain
the
animals
all
vanished
and
darkness
fell
basina
then
read
to
him
the
meaning
of
his
vision

charles
sitting
at
table
in

one
whitsuntide
with
fourteen
kings
receives
news
of
an
invasion
of
the
saxons
who
have
taken
cologne
killed
many
frankish
nobles
and
laid
waste
the
country
a
racy
epitome
of
the
events
which
follow
has
been
given
by
ludlow
in
his
popular
epics
of
the
middle
ages
as
follows
invades
saxony
and
reaches
the
banks
of
the
deep
beyond
which
lies
palace
of
supposed
to
be
dortmund
in
westphalia
the
river
is
too
deep
to
be
crossed
by
the
army
although
the
two
young
knights
baldwin
and
berard
succeed
in
doing
so
in
quest
of
adventure
the
saxons
will
not
attack
trusting
that
the
french
will
be
destroyed
by
delay
and
the
seasons
and
indeed
after
two
years
and
four
months
the
barons
represent
to
the
emperor
the
sad
plight
of
the
host
and
urge
him
to
call
upon
the
men
of
herupe
france
for
performance
of
their
warlike
service
this
is
done
accordingly
and
the
herupe
barons
make
all
haste
to
their
aid
and
come
up
just
after
the
saxons
have
made
an
unsuccessful
attack
they
send
to
ask
where
they
are
to
lodge
their
troops
the
emperor
points
them
laughingly
to
the
other
side
of
the
rune
where
float
the
silken
banners
of
the
saxons
but
says
that
any
of
his
men
shall
give
up
their
to
them
the
herupe
men
however
determine
to
take
him
at
his
word
and
whilst
the
archbishop
of
sens
blesses
the
water
boldly
fling
themselves
in
and
cross
it
and
end
after
a
tremendous
struggle
in
taking
up
the
quarters
assigned
to
them
but
when
he
sees
their
prowess
the
emperor
recalls
them
to
his
own
side
of
the
river
bridge
is
built
the
army
passes
over
it
the
saxons
are
discomfited
in
a
great
battle
and
guiteclin
is
killed
in
single
combat
by
charlemagne
himself
this
time
the
slender
vein
of
historic
truth
which
runs
through
the
poem
may
be
considered
as
quite
exhausted
yet
the
real
epic
interest
of
the
work
centres
in
its
wholly
apocryphal
conclusion
connected
essentially
with
its
purely
romantic
side
the
wife
of
guiteclin
is
a
peerless
beauty
wise
withal
and
courteous
had
she
long
and
fair
more
than
the
shining
gold
a
brow
polished
and
clear
eyes
blue
and
laughing
a
very
nose
teeth
small
and
white
a
savourous
mouth
more
crimson
than
blood
and
in
body
and
limbs
so
winning
was
she
that
god
never
made
the
man
howsoever
old
and
tottering
if
he
durst
look
at
her
but
was
moved
with
fair
helissend
the
daughter
of
the
murdered
milo
of
cologne
is
her
captive
at
once
and
her
favourite
and
when
the
french
host
takes
up
its
position
before
the
rune
names
and
points
out
young
baldwin
to
her
with
her
sanction
sebile
has
her
tent
pitched
on
the
bank
and
establishes
herself
there
with
her
ladies
to
act
as
decoys
to
the
franks
for
look
makes
men
undertake
she
is
taken
however
in
her
own
toils
falls
in
love
with
baldwin
one
day
on
seeing
him
ride
forth
with
hawk
on
wrist
and
makes
helissend
invite
him
over
the
river
under
a
very
frank
pledge
that
will
be
his
for
loss
or
their
first
meeting
apparently
takes
place
in
the
presence
of
ladies
and
so
little
mystery
is
attached
to
their
love
that
on
return
to
the
frank
host
after
killing
and
despoiling
of
his
armour
a
saxon
chief
he
not
only
tells
his
adventure
publicly
to
the
emperor
but
the
latter
promises
in
a
twelvemonth
to
have
him
crowned
king
of
the
country
and
to
give
him
sebile
for
wife
forbidding
him
however
to
cross
the
river
any
command
which
baldwin
hears
without
meaning
to
obey
nay
when
baldwin
has
once
broken
this
injunction
and
escaped
with
great
difficulty
from
the
saxons
the
emperor
imposes
on
him
the
brutal
penance
of
entering
tent
to
kiss
her
in
the
sight
of
the
saxons
and
bringing
back
her
baldwin
contrives
to
fulfil
by
putting
on
the
armour
of
a
saxon
knight
whom
he
kills
as
in
the
taking
of
orange
it
never
seems
to
occur
to
the
poet
that
there
can
be
any
moral
wrong
in
making
love
to
a
wife
or
in
promising
her
hand
in
her
lifetime
and
strange
to
say
so
benignant
are
these
paynim
that
guiteclin
is
not
represented
as
offering
or
threatening
the
slightest
to
his
faithless
queen
however
wroth
he
may
be
against
her
lover
nor
indeed
as
having
even
the
sense
to
make
her
pitch
her
tent
further
from
the
bank
the
drollest
bit
of
sentimentality
occurs
however
after
the
victory
of
the
franks
and
death
when
sebile
is
taken
prisoner
after
having
been
bestowed
in
marriage
on
baldwin
by
the
emperor
she
asks
one
boon
of
both
which
is
that
body
be
sought
for
lest
the
beasts
should
eat
request
the
exceeding
nobleness
of
which
strikes
the
emperor
and
the
frank
knights
with
astonishment
when
the
body
is
found
and
brought
to
sebile
water
of
her
eyes
falls
down
her
chin
guiteclin
said
she
gentle
a
man
were
you
liberal
and
and
of
noble
witness
if
in
heaven
and
on
earth
mahomet
has
no
power
even
to
pray
him
who
made
lazarus
i
pray
and
request
him
to
have
mercy
on
the
dead
man
is
then
placed
in
a
great
marble
tomb
sebile
is
christened
marries
her
lover
and
is
crowned
with
him
as
queen
of
saxony
helissend
being
in
like
manner
given
to
berard
is
now
that
the
truly
tragical
part
of
the
poem
commences
charles
and
his
host
depart
the
emperor
warning
his
nephew
to
be
courteous
loyal
and
generous
to
keep
true
faith
to
his
wife
yet
not
to
spend
too
much
time
in
her
arms
but
to
beware
of
the
saxons
the
caution
is
needed
for
already
the
two
sons
of
guiteclin
with
one
hundred
thousand
russians
and
bulgarians
and
the
giant
ferabras
of
russia
a
personage
twelve
feet
high
with
light
hair
plaited
together
reddish
beard
and
flattened
face
are
within
a
day
and
a
journey
of
burning
to
avenge
guiteclin
one
thursday
morning
their
invasion
is
announced
to
the
young
king
who
has
but
fifteen
thousand
men
to
oppose
to
them
sebile
embraces
her
knees
and
entreats
him
to
send
at
once
for
help
to
his
uncle
the
barons
whom
he
has
called
to
counsel
favour
her
advice
said
baldwin
should
fear
the
dishonour
of
it
it
is
too
soon
to
seek
and
pray
for
succour
we
have
not
yet
unhorsed
knights
cut
arms
from
bodies
made
bowels
trail
we
are
fifteen
thousand
young
men
untried
who
should
buy
our
praise
and
our
honour
and
seize
and
acquire
strange
lands
and
kill
and
shame
and
grieve
our
enemies
cleave
the
bright
helmets
pierce
the
shields
break
and
tear
the
hauberks
of
mail
shed
blood
and
make
brains
to
fly
to
me
a
pleasure
it
seems
to
put
on
hauberk
watch
long
nights
fast
long
days
let
us
go
strike
upon
them
without
more
delay
that
we
may
be
able
to
govern
this
the
barons
listen
with
an
to
this
speech
baldwin
himself
on
viewing
the
paynim
host
is
staggered
at
their
numbers
and
lets
sebile
persuade
him
to
send
a
messenger
to
his
uncle
however
with
five
thousand
men
he
makes
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
vanguard
of
the
saxons
consisting
of
twenty
thousand
and
ends
by
putting
them
to
flight
on
the
news
of
this
repulse
the
two
sons
of
guiteclin
come
out
apparently
with
the
bulk
of
the
army
the
french
urge
the
young
king
to
the
city
but
he
would
hold
him
for
a
sleepy
coward
he
kills
ferabras
unhorses
one
of
sons
but
the
disparity
of
numbers
is
too
great
the
french
are
obliged
to
retreat
and
shut
themselves
up
in
the
city
the
messenger
had
reached
charlemagne
at
cologne
with
the
news
of
the
renewal
of
the
war
whilst
all
his
barons
are
summoned
the
emperor
starts
in
haste
himself
for
saxony
with
ten
thousand
men
baldwin
was
seated
in
his
tower
looking
out
upon
a
league
of
hostile
tents
complaining
to
sebile
who
him
as
a
worthy
lady
bidding
him
trust
in
his
succour
she
is
the
first
to
descry
the
french
host
and
to
point
it
out
to
her
husband
god
said
nephew
father
creator
yet
will
i
avenge
me
of
the
pagan
he
goes
down
from
his
palace
and
cries
to
his
men
ye
knights
charles
is
besieged
prepare
at
once
for
a
sally
sebile
places
the
helmet
on
her
head
and
kisses
him
never
to
see
him
more
alive
the
enemy
are
disarmed
three
thousand
of
them
are
killed
by
the
time
baldwin
cuts
his
way
to
his
uncle
to
whom
as
his
liege
lord
he
makes
complaint
against
the
saxons
the
answer
contains
little
but
philosophic
comfort
nephew
so
goes
war
when
your
day
comes
know
that
you
will
die
your
father
died
you
will
not
escape
yonder
are
your
enemies
of
whom
you
complain
i
give
you
leave
go
and
strike
uncle
and
nephew
both
perform
wonders
but
berard
is
killed
by
feramor
one
of
sons
and
the
standard
which
he
bore
disappears
under
him
baldwin
engages
feramor
each
severely
wounds
the
other
the
fight
is
so
well
contested
that
baldwin
offers
to
divide
the
land
with
him
if
he
will
make
peace
the
saxon
spurns
the
offer
and
is
killed
is
wounded
in
the
breast
grievously
from
thence
to
the
spur
his
body
is
saxons
lusatians
hungarians
perceive
that
his
blows
lessen
and
fall
slow
he
cries
many
a
time
but
the
french
hear
him
not
baldwin
sees
that
he
will
have
no
succour
as
a
boar
he
defends
himself
with
his
sword
who
should
have
seen
the
proud
countenance
of
the
king
how
he
bears
and
defends
himself
against
the
paynim
great
pity
should
surely
take
his
struck
with
fifteen
wounds
his
horse
killed
under
him
he
offers
battle
on
foot
they
dare
not
approach
but
they
fling
their
swords
at
him
and
then
go
and
hide
beneath
a
rock
baldwin
feeling
death
approaching
the
fair
eyes
of
his
head
begins
to
for
sorrow
and
rage
he
now
addresses
an
elaborate
last
prayer
to
god
but
whilst
he
is
on
his
knees
looking
toward
the
east
a
saxon
comes
to
cut
off
his
head
baldwin
furious
seizes
his
sword
which
had
fallen
from
his
hand
on
the
green
grass
and
with
a
last
blow
cleaves

a
legend
of
fastrada
we
are
told
was
the
fourth
wife
of
the
emperor
charlemagne
and
the
best
beloved
historians
have
judged
that
the
lady
was
by
no
means
worthy
of
the
extraordinary
affection
bestowed
upon
her
by
her
husband
some
maintaining
that
she
practised
the
arts
of
sorcery
others
crediting
her
with
political
intrigues
and
still
others
roundly
asserting
that
she
was
not
so
virtuous
as
she
should
have
been
history
failing
to
account
for
devotion
to
his
fourth
wife
the
task
has
devolved
upon
tradition
once
upon
a
time
so
runs
the
tale
when
charlemagne
dwelt
at
zurich
he
had
a
pillar
erected
before
his
house
and
on
the
top
of
the
pillar
a
bell
was
placed
so
that
any
one
desiring
justice
had
but
to
ring
it
to
be
immediately
conducted
before
the
emperor
there
to
have
his
case
considered
one
day
just
as
charlemagne
was
about
to
dine
the
bell
was
rung
loudly
he
at
once
dispatched
his
attendants
to
bring
the
importunate
claimant
into
his
presence
a
moment
later
they
with
the
assurance
that
no
one
waited
outside
even
as
they
spoke
the
bell
rang
again
and
again
the
attendants
withdrew
at
the
bidding
of
their
royal
master
once
more
they
returned
with
the
information
that
none
was
to
be
seen
when
the
bell
rang
for
the
third
time
the
emperor
himself
rose
from
the
table
and
went
outside
to
satisfy
himself
as
to
the
identity
this
time
the
mystery
was
solved
for
twining
round
the
pillar
was
a
great
snake
which
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
the
emperor
and
his
suite
was
lustily
pulling
the
the
snake
before
me
said
charlemagne
to
man
or
beast
i
may
not
refuse
accordingly
the
snake
was
conducted
with
much
ceremony
into
the
presence
where
it
was
distinctly
observed
to
make
a
low
obeisance
the
kaiser
addressed
the
animal
courteously
as
though
it
were
a
human
being
and
inquired
what
it
wanted
whereupon
the
snake
made
a
sign
which
the
company
took
to
indicate
that
it
desired
the
emperor
to
follow
it
charlemagne
did
not
hesitate
but
followed
the
creature
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
attended
by
all
his
courtiers
straight
to
its
nest
went
the
snake
and
there
among
the
eggs
was
an
enormous
toad
puffing
out
its
bloated
body
and
staring
with
glassy
eyes
at
the
company
the
reason
for
the
appeal
was
at
once
apparent
away
that
toad
said
the
emperor
as
gravely
as
though
he
were
pronouncing
judgment
in
an
important
human
case
away
that
toad
and
burn
it
it
has
taken
unlawful
possession
of
the
the
court
listened
to
the
decree
in
respectful
silence
and
immediately
carried
out
the
sentence
the
company
thereupon
the
royal
abode
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident
on
the
following
day
however
at
about
the
same
hour
the
serpent
entered
the
chamber
in
which
charlemagne
sat
and
glided
swiftly
toward
the
table
the
attendants
were
somewhat
astonished
at
the
unexpected
appearance
but
the
kaiser
motioned
to
them
to
stand
aside
for
he
was
very
curious
to
see
what
the
reptile
would
do
raising
itself
till
its
head
was
on
a
level
with
the
table
it
dropped
into
his
plate
a
magnificent
diamond
of
the
first
water
gleaming
with
the
purest
light
this
done
the
serpent
bowed
low
as
on
the
previous
occasion
and
quitted
the
room
as
silently
as
it
had
entered
the
diamond
set
in
a
gold
ring
of
exquisite
workmanship
charlemagne
presented
to
his
wife
the
beautiful
fastrada
but
besides
being
a
thing
of
beauty
and
of
great
value
the
diamond
was
also
a
charm
for
whoever
received
it
from
another
received
with
it
a
wealth
of
personal
affection
so
was
it
with
charlemagne
and
fastrada
on
presenting
the
ring
to
his
wife
the
emperor
straightway
conceived
for
her
a
passion
far
more
intense
than
he
had
hitherto
experienced
from
that
time
to
the
day
of
her
death
he
was
her
devoted
slave
blind
and
deaf
to
all
her
faults
nay
even
when
she
died
he
refused
to
quit
the
room
in
which
she
lay
or
permit
the
interment
of
her
body
refused
to
see
the
approach
of
corruption
which
spares
not
youth
or
loveliness
seemed
in
short
to
have
lost
all
count
of
the
passage
of
time
in
his
grief
for
the
beloved
fastrada
at
length
he
was
approached
by
turpin
archbishop
of
rheims
who
had
learnt
by
occult
means
the
reason
for
the
strange
infatuation
going
up
to
the
dead
empress
he
withdrew
from
her
mouth
a
large
diamond
at
the
same
moment
charlemagne
regained
his
senses
made
arrangements
for
the
burial
of
his
wife
and
left
for
the
castle
of
frankenstein
the
possessor
of
the
ring
was
now
the
worthy
archbishop
and
to
him
the
magically
inspired
affections
of
charlemagne
were
transferred
much
to
the
good
annoyance
to
rid
himself
of
the
unwelcome
attentions
and
fulsome
flatteries
of
his
sovereign
he
cast
the
ring
into
the
lake
which
surrounded
the
castle
once
more
the
affections
changed
their
object
and
this
time
it
was
the
town
of
with
which
he
fell
in
love
and
for
which
he
retained
a
firm
attachment
all
through
his
life
finally
directing
that
he
should
be
buried
there
and
so
he
was
laid
to
rest
in
that
wondrous
old
town
in
the
church
of
mary
in
the
year
his
tomb
was
opened
by
the
emperor
otto
iii
but
the
account
that
otto
found
the
body
seated
upon
a
throne
with
crown
on
head
and
sceptre
in
hand
is
generally
regarded
as
legendary
the
sarcophagus
was
once
more
opened
by
frederick
i
in
when
the
remains
were
transferred
from
the
princely
marble
where
they
had
hitherto
rested
and
placed
in
a
wooden
coffin
fifty
years
later
however
frederick
ii
had
them
placed
in
a
splendid
shrine

original
sarcophagus
may
still
be
seen
at

the

on

moselle
and
the
other
on

meuse
but
like
other
german
states
on
the
weakening
of
the
central
power
they
split
up
into
numerous
petty
independent
principalities
each
with
its
special
history
the
palatinate
chief
among
these
was
the
state
known
as
the
palatinate
from
the
german
word
pfalz
a
name
given
generally
to
any
district
ruled
by
a
count
palatine
it
was
bounded
by
prussia
on
the
north
on
the
east
by
baden
and
on
the
south
by
we
first
hear
of
a
royal
official
known
as
the
count
palatine
of
the
rhine
in
the
tenth
century
although
the
office
was
not
originally
an
hereditary
one
it
seems
to
have
been
held
by
the
descendants
of
the
first
count
until
the
continuity
of
the
race
of
hermann
was
broken
by
the
election
of
conrad
stepbrother
of
the
german
king
frederick
i
as
count
palatine
from
that
time
till
much
later
in
german
history
the
palatinate
of
the
rhine
appears
to
have
been
gifted
during
their
lifetime
to
the
nephews
or
of
the
reigning
emperor
and
by
virtue
of
his
occupancy
of
the
office
the
holder
became
an
elector
or
voter
in
the
election
of
an
emperor
the
office
was
held
by
a
large
number
of
able
and
statesmanlike
princes
as
frederick
i
frederick
iii
the
champion
of
protestantism
and
frederick
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
palatinate
was
first
devastated
and
then
claimed
by
france
and
later
was
disturbed
by
still
more
harassing
religious
strife
in
it
was
united
with
bavaria
upon
the
reigning
elector
falling
heir
to
the
electorate
of
that
state
a
tale
of
the
palatine
house
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
nobles
of
rhineland
were
mostly
notorious
for
their
wild
savagery
and
predatory
habits
and
thus
the
modern
traveller
on
the
famous
river
admiring
the
many
picturesque
castles
built
on
summits
overlooking
its
banks
is
prone
to
think
of
these
places
as
having
been
the
homes
of
men
who
were
little
better
than
freebooters
and
in
general
this
idea
is
just
yet
walter
story
duke
karl
of
tells
how
a
medieval
german
baron
discovered
in
himself
a
keen
love
of
art
and
sought
to
gather
artists
round
him
from
france
and
well
have
been
culled
from
a
veracious
historical
source
for
at
least
a
few
of
the
german
petty
princes
of
the
middle
ages
shared
the
aestheticism
characterizing
so
many
of
their
contemporaries
among
the
noblemen
of
the
latin
races
and
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
among
the
old
german
courts
where
art
was
loved
in
this
isolated
fashion
was
that
of
the
palatine
house
which
ultimately
became
related
by
marriage
to
the
royal
stuarts
a
dynasty
as
eminently
artistic
as
the
medicis
themselves
this
palatine
house
was
regnant
for
many
generations
at
heidelberg
castle
and
there
at
a
remote
medieval
date
reigned
a
prince
named
louis
iii
who
esteemed
literature
and
painting
a
fond
parent
he
was
besides
devoted
to
his
two
sons
the
elder
called
louis
and
the
younger
frederick
and
from
the
outset
he
attended
carefully
to
the
education
of
the
pair
choosing
as
their
tutor
a
noted
scholar
one
kenmat
while
he
allowed
this
daughter
eugenia
to
be
taught
along
with
the
princely
pupils
and
he
also
admitted
to
the
group
an
italian
boy
rafaello
these
four
children
grew
up
together
and
the
palatine
prince
was
pleased
to
mark
that
frederick
though
full
of
martial
ardour
showed
intellectual
tastes
as
well
yet
the
father
did
not
live
long
to
watch
the
growth
of
the
predilection
therein
and
there
came
a
day
when
the
crown
of
louis
iii
was
acquired
by
his
heir
louis
iv
still
quite
young
the
latter
was
already
affianced
to
margaret
of
savoy
and
this
engagement
had
incensed
various
nobles
of
the
rhine
especially
the
count
of
luzenstein
he
was
eager
that
his
own
house
should
become
affiliated
with
the
palatinate
and
while
he
knew
that
there
was
little
hope
of
frustrating
prospective
wedding
this
did
not
nullify
his
ambitions
for
was
it
not
possible
that
the
marriage
might
prove
without
issue
and
as
that
would
ultimately
set
frederick
on
the
palatine
throne
luzenstein
determined
that
his
daughter
leonora
should
wed
the
younger
of
the
two
princes
she
herself
was
equally
eager
for
the
union
and
though
the
affair
was
not
definitely
arranged
in
the
meantime
it
was
widely
understood
that
at
no
very
distant
date
betrothal
would
be
announced
at
length
there
came
a
day
when
the
noblesse
of
the
rhine
assembled
at
heidelberg
to
celebrate
the
nuptials
of
louis
and
margaret
for
a
space
the
rejoicings
went
forward
merrily
but
as
louis
scanned
the
faces
of
his
guests
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
frederick
was
absent
why
was
this
he
mused
and
going
in
search
he
soon
found
his
brother
in
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
of
the
castle
attended
by
rafaello
now
the
latter
who
was
developing
a
rare
gift
for
sculpture
had
lately
made
a
statue
to
decorate
this
room
and
on
louis
entering
frederick
was
gazing
with
passionate
fondness
at
this
new
work
of
art
louis
was
straightway
called
upon
to
observe
its
loveliness
and
even
as
frederick
was
descanting
thus
a
number
of
the
guests
who
had
remarked
their
temporary
absence
trooped
into
the
room
among
them
being
leonora
of
luzenstein
she
was
in
for
frederick
had
not
so
much
as
troubled
to
salute
her
on
her
arrival
and
now
finding
him
deep
in
admiration
of
a
statue
its
subject
a
beautiful
girl
her
rancour
deepened
apace
but
who
was
the
girl
she
wondered
and
as
divers
other
guests
were
also
inquisitive
on
this
head
it
soon
transpired
that
model
had
been
eugenia
leonora
knew
that
this
girl
had
been
playmate
in
youth
so
her
wrath
turned
to
fierce
malice
for
she
suspected
that
in
eugenia
she
had
a
rival
who
might
wreck
all
hopes
of
the
luzensteins
becoming
united
to
the
palatine
house
but
frederick
regarded
eugenia
only
as
a
sister
he
knew
that
she
and
the
sculptor
who
had
hewn
her
likeness
loved
one
another
and
he
longed
to
see
their
union
brought
about
his
genuine
affection
for
the
young
italian
being
the
greater
on
account
of
blossoming
talents
as
an
artist
leonora
however
knew
nothing
of
the
real
situation
she
fancied
she
had
been
insulted
and
demanding
of
her
father
that
he
should
cease
all
negotiations
regarding
suggested
engagement
to
her
she
proceeded
to
take
stronger
measures
readers
of
sir
walter
anne
of
geierstein
will
recall
the
vehmgericht
that
whose
deeds
were
notorious
in
medieval
germany
and
it
chanced
that
the
luzensteins
were
in
touch
with
this
body
its
minions
were
called
upon
to
wreak
vengeance
on
the
younger
palatine
prince
on
several
occasions
his
life
was
attempted
and
once
he
would
certainly
have
been
killed
had
not
rafaello
succoured
him
in
the
hour
of
need
meanwhile
a
son
was
born
to
louis
and
in
celebration
of
the
event
a
tourney
was
held
at
heidelberg
competitors
coming
from
far
and
near
all
of
them
eager
to
win
the
golden
sword
which
was
promised
to
the
man
who
should
prove
champion
one
after
another
they
rode
into
the
lists
frederick
being
among
the
number
and
as
each
presented
himself
his
name
was
called
aloud
by
the
herald
at
length
there
came
one
of
whom
this
functionary
cried
is
a
nameless
knight
who
bears
a
plain
and
at
these
words
a
murmur
of
disapproval
rose
from
the
crowd
while
everyone
looked
up
to
where
louis
sat
awaiting
his
verdict
on
the
matter
but
he
signified
that
the
mysterious
aspirant
should
be
allowed
to
show
his
prowess
and
a
minute
later
all
who
were
to
take
part
being
now
assembled
frederick
and
another
competitor
were
stationed
at
opposite
ends
of
the
lists
and
the
signal
given
them
to
charge
forward
thundered
their
steeds
a
fierce
combat
ensued
but
frederick
proved
victor
and
so
another
warrior
came
forward
to
meet
him
he
too
was
worsted
and
soon
it
appeared
as
though
the
young
palatine
prince
would
surely
win
the
coveted
golden
sword
for
foeman
after
foeman
he
vanquished
and
eventually
only
two
remained
to
confront
nameless
knight
and
another
who
had
entered
the
lists
under
a
strange
though
less
suspicious
pseudonym
the
latter
expressed
his
desire
to
fight
last
of
all
and
so
the
nameless
one
galloped
toward
frederick
and
their
lances
clashed
together
the
palatine
prince
bore
his
adversary
to
the
ground
apparently
conquering
him
with
complete
ease
and
fearing
he
had
wounded
him
mortally
frederick
dismounted
with
intent
to
succour
him
but
the
speedy
fall
had
been
a
feint
and
as
the
victor
bent
down
the
mysterious
knight
suddenly
drew
a
dagger
with
intent
to
plunge
it
into
the
heart
so
stealthy
a
deed
was
unknown
in
the
history
of
the
tourney
the
crowd
gazed
as
though
petrified
and
life
would
doubtless
have
been
he
was
weak
after
his
many
not
he
who
had
asked
to
fight
last
of
all
galloped
forward
instantly
on
marking
the
drawn
weapon
and
driven
his
lance
into
the
body
of
the
murderer
it
was
rafaello
who
had
rescued
the
palatine
prince
once
again
and
it
was
a
member
of
the
luzenstein
house
who
had
sought
to
kill
him
thus
a
crafty
device
in
truth
and
thenceforth
the
name
of
luzenstein
became
abhorred
throughout
all
rhineland
while
the
brave
italian
was
honoured
by
knighthood
and
arrangements
were
made
for
his
speedy
union
with
eugenia
but
alas
the
fates
were
untoward
for
the
tribunal
having
been
baulked
again
and
again
began
to
direct
their
schemes
against
the
sculptor
instead
of
his
patron
and
one
evening
as
rafaello
was
walking
with
his
beloved
one
a
band
of
villains
attacked
and
murdered
the
pair
they
were
buried
together
at
a
place
known
for
many
centuries
after
as
grave
and
here
frederick
used
to
loiter
often
musing
fondly
on
the
dear
sister
who
had
been
snatched
from
him
in
this
ruthless
fashion
and
dreaming
of
the
lofty
artistic
career
which
he
had
planned
in
vain
for
his
beloved
rafaello
bishops
barons
and
bourgeois
to
trace
the
fortunes
divisions
and
junctions
of
the
lesser
rhine
principalities
would
be
a
work
requiring
a
world
of
patience
on
the
part
of
the
reader
as
well
as
an
amount
of
space
which
would
speedily
surpass
the
limits
even
of
such
an
ample
volume
as
the
present
the
constant
changes
of
boundary
of
these
tiny
lordships
the
hazy
character
of
the
powers
possessed
by
their
rulers
the
multiplicity
of
free
townships
yielding
obedience
to
none
but
their
own
civic
rulers
the
brief
but
none
the
less
tyrannous
rule
of
scores
of
robber
barons
who
exercised
a
régime
of
blood
and
iron
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
of
their
castellated
eyries
render
the
tracing
of
the
history
of
the
rhine
during
the
middle
ages
a
task
of
almost
unequalled
complexity
robbed
of
all
the
romance
of
history
by
reason
of
the
necessity
for
constant
attention
to
the
details
of
dynastic
and
territorial
changes
and
the
petty
squabblings
and
dreary
scufflings
of
savage
barons
with
their
neighbours
or
with
the
scarcely
less
brutal
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
who
joining
with
gusto
in
the
general
mêlée
of
served
to
swell
the
tumult
with
their
claims
for
land
and
lordship
three
of
the
electors
of
franconia
within
the
boundaries
of
which
the
palatinate
was
included
were
archbishops
and
these
were
foremost
in
all
dynastic
and
territorial
bickerings
the
growth
of
german
municipalities
since
the
days
of
their
founder
henry
the
fowler
was
not
without
effect
upon
the
empire
distinctions
of
class
were
modified
the
freeman
became
empowered
to
reserve
to
himself
the
right
of
going
to
war
along
with
his
lord
imperial
cities
began
to
spring
up
these
were
governed
by
a
lieutenant
of
the
emperor
or
by
their
own
chief
magistrate
they
achieved
confederation
thus
guarding
themselves
against
imperial
and
feudal
encroachments
the
of
the
and
that
of
the
hanse
towns
emerged
as
the
fruit
of
this
policy
the
latter
federation
consisted
of
about
cities
of
germany
which
under
their
charter
enjoyed
a
commercial
monopoly
this
example
succeeded
so
well
that
its
promoter
lübeck
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
all
cities
between
the
rhine
and
the
vistula
thus
connected
the
clergy
jealous
of
this
municipal
power
besought
the
emperor
to
repress
the
magistrates
who
had
been
called
into
being
by
the
people
and
who
were
closely
allied
to
this
commercial
confederation
but
the
monarch
advised
the
prelates
to
return
to
their
churches
lest
their
opulent
friends
became
their
enemies
the
rhine
hanse
towns
the
influence
of
the
hanseatic
league
of
the
rhine
district
in
the
fourteenth
century
extended
over
the
whole
commercial
radius
of
germany
prussia
russia
the
netherlands
and
britain
it
opened
up
new
fields
of
commerce
manufacture
and
industry
it
paved
the
way
for
culture
it
subdued
the
piracy
which
had
existed
in
the
baltic
and
it
promoted
a
universal
peace
on
the
other
hand
it
created
jealousy
it
boycotted
the
honest
manufacturer
and
merchant
who
did
not
belong
to
the
league
and
fostered
luxury
in
the
rhenish
cities
which
did
much
to
sap
the
sturdy
character
of
the
people
the
celebrity
which
many
of
these
municipalities
attained
through
their
magnificence
can
be
gathered
from
the
historic
buildings
of
worms
spires
frankfort
cologne
augsburg
and
nuremberg
the
splendour
of
these
edifices
and
the
munificence
of
their
wealthy
inhabitants
could
only
be
equalled
in
the
maritime
regions
of
italy
but
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
power
of
the
league
began
to
decline
the
russian
towns
under
the
leadership
of
novgorod
the
great
commenced
a
crusade
against
the
hanse
monopoly
in
that
country
the
general
rising
in
england
which
was
one
of
the
great
warehouses
under
henry
vi
and
edward
iv
reflected
upon
them
the
netherlands
followed
example
in
the
seventeenth
century
their
existence
was
confined
to
three
german
hamburg
and
bremen
these
no
longer
had
the
power
to
exercise
their
influence
over
the
nation
and
soon
the
league
dropped
out
of
existence
the
thirty
war
the
protracted
struggle
known
as
the
thirty
war
was
most
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
the
rhine
valley
which
was
overrun
by
the
troops
of
the
several
nationalities
engaged
one
phase
of
this
most
disastrous
war
of
the
the
rapine
and
slaughter
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
where
as
has
been
said
they
were
long
remembered
during
the
reign
of
ferdinand
iii
a
vigorous
and
protracted
war
broke
out
between
france
and
germany
the
former
assisted
by
her
ally
sweden
germany
seeing
that
unless
peace
were
restored
her
ruin
as
a
great
power
would
be
inevitable
entered
into
negotiations
with
france
and
in
the
claims
of
france
and
sweden
were
settled
by
the
peace
of
westphalia
this
treaty
is
particularly
notable
in
the
present
instance
because
it
gave
to
the
former
country
the
footing
on
the
rhine
already
mentioned
as
the
beginning
of
french
encroachments
germany
was
forced
to
give
up
alsace
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
france
by
the
seizure
of
strassburg
confirmed
by
the
treaty
of
ryswick
in
extended
her
boundaries
to
the
rhine
at
the
beginning
of
the
french
revolution
leopold
ii
of
germany
and
other
german
monarchs
agreed
to
support
the
cause
of
french
royalty
a
resolution
which
was
disastrous
to
the
empire
in
prussia
for
political
reasons
withdrew
from
the
struggle
ceding
to
france
in
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
basel
all
her
possessions
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
in
war
again
broke
out
but
in
the
treaty
of
lunéville
gave
to
france
the
whole
of
the
left
bank
of
the
river
thus
the
historic
stream
became
the
boundary
between
france
and
germany
in
the
humiliation
of
the
latter
country
was
complete
for
in
that
year
a
number
of
german
princes
joined
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
thus
allying
themselves
with
france
and
repudiating
their
allegiance
to
the
empire
in
at
the
congress
of
vienna
the
whole
of
the
lower
rhenish
district
was
restored
to
prussia
while
bavaria
a
separate
state
was
put
in
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
the
palatinate
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
from
that
time
onward
the
german
national
spirit
flourished
but
the
future
of
the
empire
was
uncertain
till
its
fate
was
decided
by
the
war
of
in
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
of
versailles
in
william
i
king
of
prussia
proclaimed
in
the
hour
of
victory
the
restoration
of
the
confederated
german
empire
the
french
forfeited
their
rhenish
provinces
and
once
more
the
rhine
was
restored
to
germany
that
the
thirty
war
did
not
fail
to
linger
in
the
is
evidenced
by
the
following
gruesome
legend
of
oppenheim
the
battle
of
skeletons
the
smoke
and
terror
of
the
great
struggle
had
surged
over
oppenheim
a
battle
had
been
fought
there
and
the
swedes
and
spaniards
who
had
contested
the
field
and
had
been
slain
lay
buried
in
the
old
churchyard
hard
by
the
confines
of
the
town
at
least
many
had
been
granted
the
right
of
sepulture
there
but
in
a
number
of
cases
the
hasty
manner
in
which
their
corpses
had
received
burial
was
all
too
noticeable
and
a
stranger
visiting
the
churchyard
confines
years
after
the
combat
could
not
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
many
uncoffined
human
relics
which
met
his
gaze
but
an
artist
who
had
journeyed
from
far
to
see
the
sun
upon
the
rhine
water
and
who
came
to
oppenheim
in
the
golden
dusk
was
too
intent
on
the
search
for
beauty
to
remember
the
grisly
reputation
of
the
town
moreover
on
entering
the
place
the
first
person
by
whom
he
had
been
greeted
was
a
beautiful
young
maiden
daughter
of
the
innkeeper
who
modestly
shrank
back
on
hearing
his
confident
tones
and
curtsying
prettily
replied
to
his
questions
in
something
like
a
whisper
you
recommend
me
to
a
comfortable
hostelry
my
pretty
maid
where
the
wine
is
good
and
the
company
jovial
the
herr
can
put
up
with
a
village
inn
that
of
my
father
is
as
good
as
any
in
the
place
replied
the
maid
my
pretty
cried
the
bold
painter
sending
the
ready
blood
to
her
face
with
a
glance
from
his
bright
black
eyes
the
way
and
i
will
follow
or
better
still
walk
with
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
inn
they
felt
like
old
friends
the
girl
had
skilfully
but
simply
discovered
the
reason
for
the
young
sojourn
in
oppenheim
and
with
glowing
face
and
eyes
that
had
grown
brighter
with
excitement
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
cried
the
herr
must
paint
my
beloved
oppenheim
there
is
no
such
place
by
moonlight
believe
me
and
you
will
be
amply
repaid
by
a
visit
to
the
ruins
of
the
old
church
see
a
pale
and
splendid
moon
has
already
risen
and
will
light
your
work
as
the
sun
never
you
ask
me
so
prettily
fräulein
i
shall
paint
your
beloved
abbey
he
replied
why
not
in
sunlight
with
your
own
sweet
face
in
the
foreground
no
cried
the
girl
hastily
would
rob
the
scene
of
all
its
you
will
said
the
artist
this
i
take
it
is
your
inn
and
i
am
ready
for
supper
we
shall
see
supper
over
the
painter
sat
for
some
time
over
his
pipe
and
his
wine
and
then
gathering
together
his
sketching
impedimenta
quitted
the
inn
and
took
his
way
toward
the
ruins
of
ancient
abbey
it
was
a
calm
windless
night
and
the
silver
moon
sailed
high
in
the
heavens
not
a
sound
broke
the
silence
as
the
young
man
entered
the
churchyard
seating
himself
upon
a
flat
tombstone
he
proceeded
to
arrange
his
canvas
and
sketching
materials
but
as
he
was
busied
thus
his
foot
struck
something
hard
bending
down
to
remove
the
obstacle
which
he
took
for
a
large
stone
he
found
to
his
horror
that
it
was
a
human
skull
with
an
ejaculation
he
cast
the
horrid
relic
away
from
him
and
to
divert
his
mind
from
the
grisly
incident
commenced
to
work
feverishly
speedily
his
buoyant
mind
cast
off
the
gloomy
train
of
thought
awakened
by
the
dreadful
find
and
for
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
he
sat
sketching
steadily
until
he
was
suddenly
startled
to
hear
the
clock
in
the
tower
above
him
strike
the
hour
of
midnight
he
was
gathering
his
things
preparatory
to
departure
when
a
strange
rustling
sound
attracted
his
attention
raising
his
eyes
from
his
task
he
beheld
a
sight
which
made
his
flesh
creep
the
exposed
and
bones
of
the
dead
warriors
which
littered
the
surface
of
the
churchyard
drew
together
and
formed
skeletons
these
reared
themselves
from
the
graves
and
stood
upright
and
as
they
did
so
formed
grisly
and
dreadful
formed
with
swedes
and
spaniards
with
spaniards
on
a
sudden
hoarse
words
of
command
rang
out
on
the
midnight
air
and
the
two
companies
attacked
one
another
the
luckless
beholder
of
the
dreadful
scene
felt
the
warm
blood
grow
chill
within
his
veins
hotter
and
hotter
became
the
fray
and
many
skeletons
sank
to
the
ground
as
though
slain
in
battle
one
of
them
he
whose
skull
the
artist
had
kicked
sank
down
at
the
young
feet
in
a
hollow
voice
he
commanded
the
youth
to
tell
to
the
world
how
they
were
forced
to
combat
each
other
because
they
had
been
enemies
in
life
and
that
they
could
obtain
no
rest
until
they
had
been
buried
directly
the
clock
struck
one
the
battle
ceased
and
the
bones
once
more
lay
about
in
disorder
the
artist
who
it
need
hardly
be
said
gave
no
more
thought
to
his
picture
hastened
back
to
the
inn
and
in
faltering
accents
related
his
experiences
when
the
seven
war
broke
out
not
long
afterward
the
people
of
oppenheim
declared
that
the
apparition
of
the
skeletons
had
foretold
the
event
the
robbers
of
the
rhine
for
many
hundreds
of
years
the
valley
of
the
rhine
itself
and
the
various
valleys
adjacent
were
the
haunt
of
numerous
bodies
of
rapacious
and
desperate
banditti
the
rugged
mountainous
nature
of
the
country
naturally
made
lawlessness
the
more
easy
there
and
till
so
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
these
gangs
of
robbers
were
a
constant
menace
to
the
traveller
in
rhineland
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
indeed
and
for
some
decades
thereafter
the
district
was
literally
infested
with
thieves
for
the
unsettled
state
of
europe
at
this
date
perforce
tended
to
bring
desperadoes
from
far
and
near
and
for
a
while
the
inhabitants
of
the
different
villages
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
endured
a
veritable
reign
of
terror
but
almost
from
the
outset
the
brigands
realized
that
they
would
soon
be
undone
if
they
grew
too
numerous
they
knew
that
in
that
event
strong
military
measures
would
probably
be
taken
against
them
so
they
made
every
effort
to
practise
that
union
which
is
proverbially
strength
and
to
prevent
the
enlisting
in
their
ranks
of
anyone
likely
to
prove
cowardly
or
perfidious
in
some
cases
too
they
actually
had
a
well
and
capably
organized
system
whereby
one
of
their
number
could
escape
quickly
if
need
be
from
the
scene
of
his
crime
for
like
the
french
prisoners
described
in
ives
they
had
a
line
of
sanctuaries
extending
perhaps
into
austria
or
italy
the
retreat
in
most
instances
being
an
inn
whose
keeper
was
sworn
to
hide
and
protect
his
robber
guest
at
all
costs
in
short
there
was
honour
among
these
thieves
and
even
a
certain
spirit
of
freemasonry
while
more
important
still
the
captain
of
a
band
was
very
often
in
league
with
the
few
police
officials
of
the
neighbourhood
the
great
highwaymen
of
stuart
and
georgian
example
that
gallant
beau
brocade
of
whom
austin
dobson
mostly
content
with
waylaying
a
chance
while
their
contemporaries
in
france
usually
worked
on
this
principle
also
as
witness
the
deeds
of
the
band
who
figure
in
théophile
story
le
capitaine
fracasse
but
the
robbers
of
the
rhine
were
of
different
mettle
from
these
and
often
it
was
almost
a
predatory
warfare
rather
than
mere
brigandage
which
they
carried
on
frequently
they
had
an
agent
in
each
of
the
villages
on
the
river
this
agent
being
usually
a
member
of
the
scattered
remnant
of
israel
and
the
business
of
this
person
was
to
discover
a
house
containing
especial
wealth
and
then
to
inform
the
robbers
accordingly
having
gleaned
the
requisite
information
in
this
wise
the
gang
would
sally
down
from
the
mountains
at
dead
of
night
and
it
was
customary
as
they
drew
near
to
their
prey
for
the
captain
to
call
his
henchmen
to
attention
and
see
that
each
was
ready
for
the
imminent
fray
then
having
gagged
the
village
watchman
and
muffled
his
bell
they
would
proceed
to
surround
the
house
they
intended
to
rifle
and
should
resistance
be
offered
to
batter
in
the
door
with
a
log
or
other
instrument
sometimes
it
would
transpire
that
the
jewish
agent
had
misinformed
them
telling
them
of
booty
where
booty
there
was
little
and
woe
betide
him
should
this
prove
the
state
of
affairs
moreover
unlike
the
brigands
in
gil
blas
these
scoundrels
of
the
rhine
would
not
be
encumbered
by
prisoners
and
they
were
wont
to
slay
outright
all
who
were
minded
to
show
fight
yet
to
their
own
brotherhood
the
robbers
were
invariably
loyal
seldom
failing
to
carry
away
with
them
such
of
their
confrères
as
were
wounded
in
the
assault
for
each
was
sworn
to
support
his
fellows
under
all
circumstances
and
awful
was
the
fate
of
the
marauder
who
violated
this
compact
it
is
told
of
a
band
commanded
by
one
picard
a
cruel
but
brave
leader
that
one
of
its
members
chanced
to
be
captured
and
with
a
view
to
purchasing
his
freedom
he
gave
information
about
the
whereabouts
of
his
chief
the
next
night
as
the
captive
lay
in
his
dungeon
a
masked
face
suddenly
appeared
at
the
barred
window
and
in
awestruck
tones
the
prisoner
asked
the
to
declare
his
identity
am
picard
your
captain
came
the
answer
in
duty
bound
i
have
risked
my
life
to
set
you
free
and
having
spoken
thus
he
proceeded
to
file
through
one
of
the
bars
which
being
accomplished
the
reprobate
was
drawn
out
of
his
cell
by
the
aid
of
a
rope
he
breathed
freely
now
finding
himself
once
more
among
some
of
his
old
comrades
but
a
moment
later
picard
addressed
him
again
he
snarled
not
think
that
your
perfidy
has
failed
to
reach
our
ears
you
must
pay
the
full
cried
the
unfortunate
one
least
let
me
die
in
action
lead
on
against
some
foe
and
let
me
fall
at
their
retorted
picard
no
such
gallant
fate
and
with
these
words
he
drove
his
sword
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
traitor
in
general
it
was
a
point
of
honour
among
these
bandits
that
none
should
reveal
to
a
woman
anything
about
the
doings
of
his
band
and
one
story
relates
how
a
young
brigand
on
the
eve
of
setting
out
on
his
first
predatory
expedition
was
rash
enough
to
inform
his
sweetheart
whither
he
and
his
mates
were
bound
their
commander
was
a
captain
jikjak
reputed
something
of
a
wit
and
betimes
after
the
brigands
had
marched
forward
silently
for
a
while
this
worthy
called
upon
them
to
halt
they
imagined
it
was
but
the
usual
inspection
of
arms
which
was
about
to
take
place
but
jikjak
speaking
in
stentorian
tones
told
them
that
a
traitor
was
in
their
midst
and
pointing
to
the
culprit
he
bade
him
step
forth
the
young
man
pled
his
youth
as
an
excuse
for
his
fault
and
he
told
the
captain
that
could
he
but
get
a
chance
to
show
his
prowess
once
they
would
soon
see
that
he
was
as
gallant
a
robber
as
any
of
them
but
jikjak
laughed
scornfully
saying
he
was
anxious
to
find
out
which
was
stronger
the
young
legs
or
a
pair
of
trees
the
culprit
quailed
on
hearing
the
verdict
and
implored
a
less
ghastly
fate
but
jikjak
was
obdurate
and
smiling
blandly
he
bade
his
followers
bend
a
couple
of
stout
branches
to
the
ground
and
tie
their
tops
to
the
ankles
of
the
offender
such
then
were
the
robbers
of
the
rhine
and
such
the
code
of
honour
which
existed
among
them
a
romantic
institution
they
no
doubt
were
yet
it
was
a
form
of
picturesqueness
whose
disappearance
can
scarcely
be
regretted
chapter
rhine
in
folklore
and
literature
affinities
of
the
rhine
legends
a
close
perusal
of
the
body
of
tradition
known
as
the
legends
of
the
rhine
displays
one
circumstance
which
is
calculated
to
surprise
the
collector
of
these
narratives
not
a
little
it
is
generally
through
ignorance
of
the
real
these
tales
abound
in
the
matter
of
folklore
this
is
however
by
no
means
the
case
and
even
a
superficial
examination
of
them
will
prove
most
of
them
to
be
allied
to
the
matter
of
romance
in
a
much
more
intimate
way
than
they
approach
that
of
folklore
but
this
is
not
so
as
regards
all
of
them
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
look
into
the
character
of
those
which
present
folklore
affinities
whilst
leaving
the
consideration
of
their
romantic
aspect
for
a
later
portion
of
this
chapter
by
right
of
precedence
among
the
legends
of
the
rhine
which
possess
folklore
characteristics
is
the
wonderful
legend
of
the
lorelei
a
word
derived
from
the
old
high
german
lur
to
lurk
and
lai
a
rock
the
height
from
which
the
bewitching
sent
her
song
floating
over
the
waves
of
the
rhine
is
situated
near
goar
and
possesses
a
remarkable
echo
which
may
partly
account
for
the
legend
the
lorelei
many
are
the
legends
which
cluster
round
the
name
of
the
lorelei
in
some
of
the
earlier
traditions
she
is
represented
as
an
undine
combing
her
hair
on
the
and
singing
bewitching
strains
wherewith
to
lure
mariners
to
their
death
and
one
such
legend
relates
how
an
old
soldier
named
diether
undertook
to
capture
her
graf
ludwig
son
of
the
prince
palatine
had
been
caught
in
her
toils
his
frail
barque
wrecked
and
he
himself
caught
in
the
whirlpool
and
drowned
the
prince
grievously
stricken
at
the
melancholy
occurrence
longed
to
avenge
his
death
on
the
evil
enchantress
who
had
wrought
such
havoc
among
his
retainers
there
was
but
one
who
would
undertake
the
captain
of
the
guard
named
the
sole
reward
he
craved
was
permission
to
cast
the
lorelei
into
the
depths
she
haunted
should
he
succeed
in
capturing
her
diether
and
his
little
band
of
warriors
ascended
the
rock
in
such
a
way
as
to
cut
off
all
retreat
on
the
landward
side
just
as
they
reached
the
summit
the
moon
sailed
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
behold
the
spirit
of
the
whirlpool
was
seen
sitting
on
the
very
verge
of
the
precipice
binding
her
wet
hair
with
a
band
of
gleaming
jewels
wouldst
thou
with
me
she
cried
starting
to
her
feet
cast
thee
into
the
rhine
sorceress
said
diether
roughly
thou
hast
drowned
our
returned
the
maid
drowned
him
not
his
own
folly
which
cost
him
his
as
she
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
her
lips
smiling
her
eyes
gleaming
softly
her
wet
dark
hair
streaming
over
her
shoulders
some
strange
unearthly
quality
in
her
beauty
a
potent
spell
fell
upon
the
little
company
so
that
even
diether
himself
could
neither
move
nor
speak
wouldst
thou
cast
me
in
the
rhine
diether
she
pursued
smiling
at
the
helpless
warrior
not
i
who
go
to
the
rhine
but
the
rhine
that
will
come
to
then
loosening
the
jewelled
band
from
her
hair
she
flung
it
on
the
water
and
cried
aloud
send
me
thy
white
steeds
that
i
may
cross
the
river
in
instantly
as
at
her
bidding
a
wild
storm
arose
and
the
river
overflowing
its
banks
foamed
right
up
to
the
summit
of
the
lorelei
rock
three
waves
resembling
three
white
horses
mounted
the
steep
and
into
the
hollowed
trough
behind
them
the
lorelei
stepped
as
into
a
chariot
to
be
whirled
out
into
the
stream
meanwhile
diether
and
his
companions
were
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
floods
yet
they
were
unable
to
stir
hand
or
foot
in
the
undine
sank
beneath
the
waves
the
spell
was
broken
the
waters
subsided
and
the
captain
and
his
men
were
free
to
return
home
nevermore
they
vowed
would
they
seek
to
capture
the
lorelei
the
forsaken
bride
there
is
a
later
and
more
popular
legend
of
the
lorelei
than
the
foregoing
according
to
this
tale
lorelei
was
a
maiden
of
surpassing
beauty
who
dwelt
in
the
town
of
bacharach
in
medieval
times
so
potent
were
her
attractions
that
every
gallant
on
whom
her
eye
rested
fell
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
while
her
fame
drew
suitors
in
plenty
from
all
parts
of
the
country
the
dismissed
lovers
wandered
disconsolately
in
the
neighbouring
forests
vowing
to
take
their
lives
rather
than
suffer
the
pangs
of
unrequited
passion
while
occasionally
the
threat
was
fulfilled
and
a
brave
knight
would
cast
himself
into
the
rhine
and
perish
for
love
of
the
cold
and
cruel
maid
thus
her
fatal
beauty
played
havoc
among
the
flower
of
german
chivalry
but
she
dowered
with
virtue
and
goodness
as
well
as
with
more
transient
charms
trembled
when
she
saw
the
effect
of
her
attractions
on
her
many
lovers
and
secluded
herself
as
closely
as
possible
the
truth
was
she
had
given
her
heart
into
the
keeping
of
a
young
knight
who
after
plighting
his
troth
with
her
had
ridden
away
to
the
wars
his
military
ardour
and
desire
for
glory
triumphing
over
his
love
years
had
gone
by
yet
he
did
not
return
and
lorelei
thought
that
he
had
perished
on
the
field
of
battle
or
had
taken
another
bride
and
forgotten
her
but
she
remained
true
to
him
in
spite
of
his
long
silence
and
spent
her
days
in
tears
and
prayers
for
his
safety
meanwhile
she
was
besieged
by
an
band
of
suitors
to
whom
her
retiring
disposition
and
sorrowful
mien
but
made
her
the
more
desirable
then
it
began
to
be
rumoured
abroad
that
she
was
a
sorceress
who
won
the
hearts
of
men
by
magic
art
and
with
the
aid
of
the
evil
one
the
rumour
was
spread
broadcast
by
jealous
and
disappointed
women
who
saw
their
menfolk
succumb
to
the
fatal
charms
of
the
maid
of
bacharach
mothers
noticed
their
sons
grow
pale
and
because
of
her
maids
their
erstwhile
lovers
sighing
out
a
hopeless
passion
for
the
beautiful
lorelei
so
they
brought
against
her
accusations
of
sorcery
which
in
those
days
generally
led
to
the
death
of
the
victim
by
burning
so
grievously
did
these
malign
whispers
add
to
the
already
heavy
burden
of
the
maid
that
she
surrendered
herself
to
be
tried
hardly
caring
whether
or
not
she
were
found
guilty
she
was
summoned
before
the
criminal
court
held
at
rhens
by
the
archbishop
of
cologne
and
charged
with
practising
the
black
art
in
order
to
ensnare
affections
however
when
she
appeared
before
the
court
her
beauty
so
impressed
the
assembly
and
even
the
old
archbishop
himself
that
none
could
believe
her
guilty
her
lovely
face
bore
the
imprint
of
innocence
her
grief
touched
every
heart
and
on
all
sides
she
was
treated
with
the
greatest
respect
and
kindness
the
old
prelate
assured
her
that
she
would
not
be
judged
harshly
but
begged
to
hear
from
her
own
lips
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
foul
charge
brought
against
her
this
assurance
she
gave
with
artless
simplicity
and
a
murmur
of
approval
went
up
from
the
crowd
the
sympathy
of
those
even
her
accusers
were
the
kindness
of
the
aged
churchman
who
was
her
judge
moved
her
to
confess
her
unhappy
pray
thee
she
concluded
wearily
pray
thee
my
lord
let
me
die
i
know
alas
that
many
true
knights
have
died
for
love
of
me
and
now
i
fain
would
die
for
the
sake
of
one
who
hath
forsaken
the
prelate
moved
almost
to
tears
by
the
pathetic
story
laid
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
weeping
maid
shalt
not
die
fair
maiden
he
said
will
send
thee
to
a
convent
where
thou
mayst
live
in
and
calling
to
his
side
three
trusty
old
knights
he
bade
them
conduct
lorelei
to
the
convent
across
the
river
and
charge
the
abbess
to
treat
her
with
the
greatest
kindness
having
blessed
the
maid
once
more
he
bade
them
go
on
their
way
to
the
convent
they
must
needs
pass
the
rock
since
known
as
the
and
the
girl
who
had
maintained
a
pensive
silence
all
the
way
now
observed
that
she
would
fain
ascend
the
rock
and
look
for
the
last
time
at
the
castle
of
her
betrothed
knight
her
escort
would
have
courteously
assisted
her
but
she
with
the
agility
of
youth
easily
outstripped
them
and
stood
alone
on
the
summit
surveying
the
fair
scene
before
her
a
light
barque
was
sailing
up
the
river
and
as
she
gazed
on
it
lorelei
uttered
a
loud
cry
for
there
in
the
bow
stood
her
truant
lover
the
knight
and
his
train
heard
the
shriek
and
beheld
with
horror
the
maiden
standing
with
outstretched
arms
on
the
very
edge
of
the
precipice
the
steering
of
the
boat
was
forgotten
for
the
moment
and
the
frail
craft
ran
on
the
rocks
lorelei
saw
her
peril
and
calling
his
name
leapt
into
the
tide
nothing
more
was
seen
of
the
lovers
together
they
sleep
the
sleep
of
death
beneath
the
waters
of
the
rhine
a
blending
of
legends
in
these
legends
we
observe
how
the
tradition
of
a
mere
has
developed
into
a
story
concerning
a
hapless
damsel
the
first
applies
to
the
lorelei
as
a
pure
and
simple
but
legends
which
refer
to
beings
originally
have
a
knack
of
becoming
associated
in
later
times
with
stories
of
distressed
ladies
indeed
one
such
came
to
the
knowledge
only
a
few
months
ago
the
mansion
of
caroline
park
near
edinburgh
dating
from
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
has
in
its
vicinity
a
well
which
is
reputed
to
be
inhabited
by
a
lady
who
emerges
from
her
watery
dwelling
at
twilight
and
rings
the
great
bell
of
the
old
on
visiting
the
vicinity
for
the
purpose
of
verifying
the
legend
information
was
gleaned
respecting
another
story
of
a
captured
lady
who
had
been
incarcerated
in
a
room
in
the
mansion
and
had
written
some
verses
to
her
lover
with
her
diamond
ring
on
a
the
strange
thing
is
that
these
stories
though
obviously
of
different
origin
appear
now
to
have
become
fused
in
the
popular
imagination
the
and
the
damsel
become
one
and
the
same
thus
affording
a
case
in
point
of
the
fusion
of
a
mythological
tale
with
a
later
and
probably
verifiable
incident
the
lorelei
is
of
course
a
of
the
siren
type
one
who
lures
heedless
mariners
to
their
destruction
in
scotland
and
the
north
of
england
we
find
her
congener
in
the
who
lurks
in
pools
lying
in
wait
for
victims
but
the
kelpie
is
usually
represented
in
the
form
of
a
horse
and
not
in
that
of
a
beauteous
maiden
the
nixie
another
not
unlike
the
lorelei
is
the
nixie
which
is
both
male
and
female
the
male
appearing
like
any
human
being
but
as
in
the
case
of
the
of
the
slavonic
peoples
and
england
scotland
and
central
america
being
possessed
of
green
teeth
the
male
is
called
nix
the
female
nixie
the
generic
term
for
both
being
nicker
from
a
root
which
perhaps
means
there
is
perhaps
some
truth
in
the
statement
which
would
derive
the
satanic
patronymic
of
from
these
beings
as
spirits
extremely
familiar
to
the
teutonic
mind
on
fine
sunny
days
the
nixies
may
be
seen
sitting
on
the
banks
of
rivers
or
on
the
branches
of
trees
combing
their
long
golden
locks
previous
to
a
drowning
accident
the
nixies
can
be
seen
dancing
on
the
surface
of
the
water
like
all
sea
and
river
spirits
their
subaqueous
abode
is
of
a
magnificence
unparalleled
upon
earth
and
to
this
they
often
convey
mortals
who
however
complain
that
the
splendours
of
the
palaces
are
altogether
spoiled
for
them
by
the
circumstance
that
their
banquets
are
served
without
salt
where
on
the
marshes
boometh
the
bittern
nicker
the
soulless
sits
with
his
ghittern
sits
inconsolable
friendless
and
foeless
bewailing
his
destiny
nicker
the
soulless
the
nixie
of
the
the
legend
of
the
nixie
of
seebach
is
one
of
gloom
and
tragedy
albeit
as
charming
as
most
of
the
rhine
tales
it
was
the
custom
among
the
young
people
of
seebach
to
assemble
of
an
evening
in
the
which
on
the
occasion
about
to
be
dealt
with
was
in
the
house
of
the
richest
and
most
distinguished
family
in
the
country
the
girls
spun
and
laughed
and
chatted
while
the
youths
hung
about
their
chairs
and
cracked
jokes
with
them
one
evening
while
they
were
thus
employed
there
came
among
them
a
stranger
a
young
lady
beautifully
clad
and
carrying
an
ivory
with
becoming
modesty
she
asked
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
company
which
permission
the
simple
youths
and
maidens
readily
accorded
none
was
more
eager
to
do
honour
to
the
than
the
son
of
their
host
while
the
others
were
still
gaping
in
awestruck
fashion
he
quietly
fetched
her
a
chair
and
performed
various
little
services
for
her
she
received
his
attentions
so
graciously
that
a
warmer
feeling
than
courtesy
sprang
up
in
his
heart
for
the
fair
spinner
he
was
in
truth
a
handsome
lad
whose
attentions
any
maid
might
have
been
proud
to
receive
and
slender
he
bore
himself
with
a
proud
carriage
and
the
expression
on
his
delicate
features
was
grave
and
thoughtful
beyond
his
years
when
at
length
the
fair
visitor
departed
he
loitered
disconsolate
and
restless
listening
to
the
idle
surmises
of
the
peasant
youths
concerning
the
identity
of
the
lady
but
offering
no
opinion
himself
on
the
following
day
at
the
same
hour
she
again
appeared
and
seeing
her
cavalier
of
the
previous
day
smiled
and
bowed
to
him
the
young
man
glowed
with
pleasure
and
diffidently
renewed
his
attentions
day
after
day
the
lady
of
the
joined
the
company
and
it
was
noted
that
the
girls
were
brighter
and
more
diligent
and
the
young
men
more
gentle
and
courteous
for
her
coming
it
was
whispered
among
them
that
she
was
a
nixie
from
the
far
under
the
mountains
for
never
mortal
was
so
richly
endowed
with
beauty
and
grace
as
time
went
on
the
son
of
the
house
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
as
his
love
for
the
fair
unknown
became
deeper
only
during
the
brief
hour
of
her
visit
would
he
show
any
cheerfulness
all
the
rest
of
the
day
he
would
mope
in
silent
wretchedness
his
friends
saw
with
distress
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
but
they
were
powerless
to
alter
matters
the
lady
could
not
be
persuaded
to
remain
beyond
her
usual
hour
nor
to
give
any
hint
of
her
identity
one
day
thinking
to
prolong
her
visit
the
young
man
put
back
the
hands
of
the
clock
when
the
hour
drew
near
for
her
to
depart
he
slipped
out
of
the
house
so
that
he
might
follow
her
and
find
out
where
she
lived
when
the
hour
struck
the
lady
who
seemed
to
have
feared
that
she
was
late
walked
hastily
from
the
house
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
so
quickly
did
she
walk
that
the
youth
following
in
her
path
could
scarcely
keep
pace
with
her
she
did
not
pause
when
she
reached
the
shore
but
plunged
directly
into
the
water
a
low
moaning
sound
rose
from
the
waves
which
boiled
and
bubbled
furiously
and
the
young
man
fearing
that
some
evil
had
befallen
the
maid
sprang
in
after
her
but
the
cruel
currents
dragged
him
down
and
he
sank
out
of
sight
next
day
his
body
was
found
floating
on
the
lake
by
some
woodcutters
and
the
nixie
of
the
was
seen
no
more
the
wild
huntsman
one
of
the
most
interesting
rhine
myths
is
that
concerning
the
wild
huntsman
which
is
known
all
over
rhineland
and
which
is
connected
with
many
of
its
localities
the
tale
goes
that
on
windy
nights
the
wild
huntsman
with
his
yelling
pack
of
hounds
sweeps
through
the
air
his
prey
departing
souls
the
huntsman
is
of
course
odin
who
in
some
of
his
aspects
was
a
the
english
legend
of
herne
the
hunter
who
haunts
windsor
park
is
allied
to
this
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
herne
is
odin
indeed
it
is
here
suggested
that
the
name
herne
may
in
some
way
be
connected
with
one
of
titles
hâri
the
high
one
it
was
the
legend
of
the
wild
huntsman
that
inspired
sir
walter
scott
to
write
one
of
his
finest
ballads
of
the
mysterious
an
edinburgh
friend
had
perused
a
ballad
by
burger
entitled
lenore
but
all
he
could
remember
of
it
were
the
following
four
lines
tramp
tramp
across
the
land
they
ride
splash
splash
across
the
sea
hurrah
the
dead
can
ride
apace
dost
fear
to
ride
with
me
this
verse
fired
imagination
he
liked
this
sort
of
thing
and
could
do
it
very
well
himself
so
on
reaching
home
he
sat
down
to
the
composition
of
the
following
ballad
of
which
we
give
the
most
outstanding
verses
the
wild
huntsman
the
wildgrave
winds
his
bugle
horn
to
horse
to
horse
haloo
haloo
his
fiery
courser
sniffs

the
bush

the
bell
hath
tolled
but
still
the
wildgrave
onward
rides
haloo
haloo
and
hark
again
when
spurring
from
opposing
sides
two
stranger
horsemen
join
the
train
who
was
each
stranger

right
well
may
i
guess

dare
not
tell
the

the
subterranean
treasures
but
who
on
occasion
reveal
them
to
mortals
we
meet
with
these
very
frequently
under
different
guises
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
of
auerbach
and
the
yellow
dwarf
who
appears
in
the
legend
of
elfeld
the
heldenbuch
the
ancient
book
in
which
are
collected
the
deeds
of
the
german
heroes
of
old
says
that
gave
the
dwarfs
being
because
the
land
on
the
mountains
was
altogether
waste
and
uncultivated
and
there
was
much
store
of
silver
and
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
still
in
the
mountains
wherefore
god
made
the
dwarfs
very
artful
and
wise
that
they
might
know
good
and
evil
right
well
and
for
what
everything
was
good
some
stones
give
great
strength
some
make
those
who
carry
them
about
them
invisible
that
is
called
a
and
therefore
did
god
give
the
dwarfs
skill
and
wisdom
therefore
they
built
handsome
and
god
gave
them
keightley
in
his
celebrated
fairy
mythology
tells
of
a
class
of
dwarfs
called
heinzelmännchen
who
used
to
live
and
perform
their
exploits
in
cologne
these
were
obviously
of
the
same
class
as
the
brownies
of
scotland
teutonic
who
attached
themselves
to
the
owners
of
certain
dwellings
and
keightley
culled
the
following
anecdote
regarding
them
from
a
cologne
publication
issued
in
the
time
that
the
heinzelmännchen
were
still
there
there
was
in
cologne
many
a
baker
who
kept
no
man
for
the
little
people
used
always
to
make
overnight
as
much
black
and
white
bread
as
the
baker
wanted
for
his
shop
in
many
houses
they
used
to
wash
and
do
all
their
work
for
the
maids
about
this
time
there
was
an
expert
tailor
to
whom
they
appeared
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
for
when
he
married
he
found
in
his
house
on
the
the
finest
victuals
and
the
most
beautiful
utensils
which
the
little
folk
had
stolen
elsewhere
and
brought
to
their
favourite
when
with
time
his
family
increased
the
little
ones
used
to
give
the
wife
considerable
aid
in
her
household
affairs
they
washed
for
her
and
on
holidays
and
festival
times
they
scoured
the
copper
and
tin
and
the
house
from
the
garret
to
the
cellar
if
at
any
time
the
tailor
had
a
press
of
work
he
was
sure
to
find
it
all
ready
done
for
him
in
the
morning
by
the
heinzelmännchen
curiosity
began
now
to
torment
the
wife
and
she
was
dying
to
get
one
sight
of
the
heinzelmännchen
but
do
what
she
would
she
could
never
compass
it
she
one
time
strewed
peas
all
down
the
stairs
that
they
might
fall
and
hurt
themselves
and
that
so
she
might
see
them
next
morning
but
this
project
missed
and
since
that
time
the
heinzelmännchen
have
totally
disappeared
as
has
been
everywhere
the
case
owing
to
the
curiosity
of
people
which
has
at
all
times
been
the
destruction
of
so
much
of
what
was
beautiful
in
the
world
heinzelmännchen
in
consequence
of
this
went
off
all
in
a
body
out
of
the
town
with
music
playing
but
people
could
only
hear
the
music
for
no
one
could
see
the
mannikins
themselves
who
forthwith
got
into
a
ship
and
went
away
whither
no
one
knows
the
good
times
however
are
said
to
have
disappeared
from
cologne
along
with
the
ursula
one
of
the
most
interesting
figures
in
connexion
with
rhenish
mythology
is
that
of
ursula
whose
legend
is
as
follows
just
two
centuries
after
the
birth
of
christ
vionest
was
king
of
britain
happy
in
his
realm
his
subjects
were
prosperous
and
contented
but
care
was
in
the
heart
of
the
monarch
for
he
was
childless
at
length
his
consort
daria
bore
him
a
daughter
who
as
she
grew
up
in
years
increased
in
holiness
until
all
men
regarded
her
as
a
saint
and
she
devoting
herself
to
a
religious
life
refused
all
offers
of
marriage
to
the
great
grief
of
her
parents
who
were
again
troubled
by
the
thought
that
their
dynasty
would
fail
for
want
of
an
heir
charmed
with
the
rumour
of
her
virtues
a
german
prince
agrippus
asked
her
as
a
wife
for
his
son
but
the
suit
was
declined
by
the
maiden
until
an
angel
appeared
to
her
in
a
dream
and
said
that
the
nuptials
ought
to
take
place
in
obedience
to
this
heavenly
mentor
ursula
no
longer
urged
her
former
scruples
and
her
father
hastened
to
make
preparations
of
suitable
magnificence
for
her
departure
to
the
rhine
on
whose
banks
her
future
home
was
to
be
eleven
thousand
virgins
were
selected
from
the
noblest
families
of
britain
to
accompany
their
princess
who
marshalling
them
on
the
seashore
bade
them
sing
a
hymn
to
the
most
high
and
dismiss
all
fears
of
the
ocean
for
she
had
been
gifted
with
a
divine
knowledge
of
navigation
and
would
guide
them
safely
on
their
way
accordingly
ursula
dismissed
all
the
seamen
and
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
principal
vessel
she
gave
orders
to
her
eleven
thousand
maiden
followers
who
under
the
influence
of
inspiration
flitted
over
the
ships
dressed
in
virgin
white
now
tending
the
sails
now
fixing
the
ropes
now
guiding
the
helm
until
they
reached
the
mouth
of
the
rhine
up
which
they
sailed
in
saintly
procession
to
cologne
here
they
were
received
with
great
honours
by
the
roman
governor
of
the
place
but
soon
they
left
the
city
to
ascend
the
stream
to
basel
on
their
way
to
rome
to
which
holy
city
ursula
had
determined
upon
making
a
pilgrimage
wherever
upon
their
journey
they
met
the
officers
of
state
they
were
received
as
befitted
their
heavenly
mission
and
from
basel
were
accompanied
by
pantulus
who
was
afterward
canonized
and
whose
portrait
is
to
be
seen
in
the
church
of
ursula
once
at
rome
pope
cyriacus
himself
was
so
affected
by
their
devoted
piety
that
after
praying
with
them
at
the
tombs
of
the
apostles
he
determined
on
abdicating
the
pontifical
office
to
accompany
them
on
their
return
down
the
rhine
to
cologne
at
mayence
they
were
joined
by
prince
coman
the
son
of
agrippus
who
for
love
of
his
betrothed
at
once
forsook
the
errors
of
his
pagan
faith
and
was
baptized
the
eleven
thousand
virgins
with
their
sainted
leader
her
husband
and
pope
cyriacus
passed
rapidly
to
cologne
where
however
they
were
not
long
destined
to
live
in
peace
a
horde
of
barbarians
from
the
north
invaded
the
place
and
having
gained
possession
of
the
city
they
slew
the
virgin
retinue
of
ursula
the
venerable
pope
the
saint
herself
and
her
spouse
coman
after
inflicting
the
most
horrible
tortures
upon
them
some
were
nailed
living
to
the
cross
some
were
burned
others
stoned
but
the
most
refined
cruelties
were
reserved
for
the
most
distinguished
victims
look
on
the
walls
of
the
church
of
ursula
and
you
will
see
depicted
the
sufferings
of
the
young
martyr
and
of
her
youthful
husband
her
chapel
yet
contains
her
effigy
with
a
dove
at
her
emblem
of
her
purity
and
faith
and
while
the
devout
may
in
the
same
church
behold
the
religiously
preserved
bones
of
the
eleven
thousand
virgins
saint
or
goddess
the
sainthood
of
ursula
is
distinctly
doubtful
and
the
number
of
her
retinue
eleven
thousand
has
been
proved
to
be
an
error
in
monkish
calligraphy
ursula
is
indeed
the
teutonic
goddess
ursa
or
hörsel
in
many
parts
of
germany
a
custom
existed
during
the
middle
ages
of
rolling
about
a
ship
on
wheels
much
to
the
scandal
of
the
clergy
and
this
undoubtedly
points
to
the
worship
of
holda
or
ursula
whom
german
poets
of
old
regarded
as
sailing
over
the
deep
blue
of
the
heavens
in
her
silver
boat
a
great
company
of
maidens
the
stars
follow
in
her
train
she
is
supposed
her
nightly
pilgrimage
over
to
enter
certain
hills
thus
in
the
later
guise
of
venus
she
entered
the
hörselberg
in
thuringia
in
which
she
imprisoned
the
enchanted
tannhäuser
and
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
she
also
presided
over
the
ercildoune
or
hill
of
ursula
in
the
south
of
scotland
the
modern
earlston
after
which
thomas
the
rhymer
took
his
territorial
designation
and
whose
story
later
became
fused
with
her
myth
in
the
old
scottish
ballad
of
thomas
the
rhymer
thus
we
observe
how
it
is
possible
for
a
pagan
myth
to
become
an
incident
in
christian
hagiology
satan
in
rhine
story
in
the
legends
of
the
rhine
the
picturesque
figure
of
his
satanic
majesty
is
frequently
presented
as
in
the
legends
of
of
solingen
architect
of
cologne
cathedral
and
several
other
tales
the
circumstances
of
his
appearance
are
distinctly
teutonic
in
character
and
are
such
as
to
make
one
doubt
that
the
devil
of
the
german
peoples
has
evolved
from
the
classical
satyr
may
it
not
be
that
the
teutonic
folk
possessed
some
from
which
they
evolved
a
satanic
figure
of
their
own
against
this
of
course
could
be
quoted
the
fact
that
the
medieval
conception
of
the
devil
was
sophisticated
by
the
church
which
in
turn
was
strongly
influenced
by
classical
types
affinity
of
the
rhine
legends
with
romance
but
on
the
whole
the
legends
of
the
rhine
exhibit
much
more
affinity
with
medieval
romance
than
with
myth
or
a
large
number
of
them
are
based
upon
plots
which
can
be
shown
to
be
almost
universal
and
which
occur
again
and
again
in
french
and
british
story
one
of
the
commonest
of
these
concerns
the
crusader
who
rejected
by
his
spends
hopeless
years
in
the
east
or
having
married
before
setting
out
for
the
orient
returns
to
find
his
bride
the
wife
of
another
the
crusader
exercised
a
strong
influence
upon
the
literature
of
medieval
europe
and
that
influence
we
find
in
a
very
marked
degree
in
the
legends
of
the
rhine
again
a
number
of
these
tales
undoubtedly
consist
of
older
materials
not
necessarily
mythical
in
origin
over
which
a
later
medieval
colour
has
been
cast
unhappily
many
of
these
beautiful
old
legends
have
been
greatly
marred
by
the
absurd
sentimentality
of
the
german
writers
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
and
their
dramatis
personae
instead
of
exhibiting
the
characteristics
of
sturdy
medieval
german
folk
possess
the
mincing
and
lackadaisical
manners
which
mark
the
novel
of
a
century
ago
this
contrasts
most
ludicrously
in
many
cases
with
the
simple
almost
childlike
honesty
which
is
typical
of
all
early
teutonic
literature
had
a
charles
lamb
a
leigh
hunt
or
an
edgar
allan
poe
recast
these
tales
how
different
would
have
been
their
treatment
before
the
time
of
schiller
and
goethe
french
models
prevailed
in
german
literature
these
wizards
of
the
pen
recovered
the
german
spirit
of
mystery
and
brought
back
to
their
haunts
gnomes
kobolds
and
but
the
mischief
had
been
done
ere
they
dawned
upon
the
horizon
and
there
were
other
parts
of
germany
which
appeared
to
them
more
suitable
for
literary
presentment
than
the
rhine
save
perhaps
in
drama
moreover
the
inherent
sentimentality
of
the
german
character
however
fitted
to
bring
out
the
mysterious
atmosphere
which
clings
to
these
legends
has
weakened
them
considerably

rise
and
origin
the
poetry
of
the
rhine
robert
louis
stevenson
exiled
in
the
south
pacific
islands
used
to
speak
with
passionate
fondness
of
the
rivers
of
his
native
scotland
the
country
he
loved
so
dearly
but
which
the
jealous
fates
forbade
him
to
visit
during
fully
half
his
life
garry
and
tummel
tweed
and
used
to
think
of
these
as
of
something
almost
sacred
while
even
the
name
of
that
insignificant
stream
the
water
of
leith
sounded
on
his
ear
like
sweet
music
evoking
a
strangely
tender
and
pathetic
emotion
and
this
emotion
crystallized
so
beautifully
by
stevenson
in
one
of
his
essays
in
memories
and
portraits
must
have
been
felt
too
by
many
other
exiles
wandering
in
foreign
parts
for
surely
an
analogous
feeling
has
been
experienced
sometimes
by
every
traveller
of
sensitive
and
imaginative
temperament
particularly
the
traveller
exiled
irrevocably
from
his
home
and
longing
passionately
to
see
it
horatius
about
to
plunge
into
the
tiber
addressed
it
as
his
father
and
god
charging
it
to
care
well
for
his
life
and
in
which
those
of
all
rome
were
involved
for
the
time
being
ecce
tiber
was
the
glad
cry
of
the
romans
on
beholding
the
cry
which
shows
once
again
with
what
ardent
devotion
they
thought
of
the
river
which
passed
by
their
native
city
while
naaman
the
syrian
told
that
his
sickness
would
be
cured
would
he
but
lave
his
leprous
limbs
in
the
jordan
exclaimed
aghast
against
a
prescription
which
appeared
to
him
nothing
short
of
sacrilegious
and
insulting
and
declared
that
there
were
better
and
nobler
streams
in
his
own
land
even
the
deadly
complaint
with
which
he
was
smitten
could
not
shake
his
fidelity
to
these
could
not
alter
his
conviction
that
they
were
superior
to
alien
streams
and
the
truth
is
that
nearly
every
great
because
its
perpetual
motion
makes
it
seem
verily
a
living
a
way
of
establishing
itself
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
dwell
by
its
banks
the
rhine
is
no
exception
to
this
rule
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
notable
illustration
thereof
from
time
immemorial
the
name
of
the
mighty
stream
has
been
sacred
to
the
germans
while
gradually
a
halo
of
romantic
glamour
has
wound
itself
about
the
river
a
halo
which
appeals
potently
even
to
many
who
have
never
seen
the
vaterland
am
rhein
there
not
magic
in
the
words
and
how
they
call
up
dreams
of
robber
barons

his
strange
castle
built

the
edge
of
a
precipice
overlooking
the
rushing

sprites
of
the

and
whirlpool
weird
huntsmen
and
all
the
dramatis

of
legend
and
tradition
the
rhine
has
ever
held
a
wide
fame
in
the
domain
of
literature
for
there
is
scarcely
a
place
on
the
banks
but
has
its
legend
which
has
been
enshrined
in
song
and
some
of
these
songs
are
so
old
that
the
names
of
their
makers
have
long
since
been
forgotten
yes
we
have
to
go
very
far
back
indeed
would
we
study
the
poetry
of
the
rhine
adequately
we
have
to
penetrate
deeply
into
the
middle
ages
dim
and
mysterious
and
looking
back
thus
and
pondering
on
these
legendary
and
anonymous
writings
a
poem
which
soon
drifts
into
recollection
is
one
whose
scene
is
laid
near
the
little
town
of
lorch
or
lordch
hard
by
this
town
is
a
mountain
known
to
geographers
as
kedrich
but
hailed
popularly
as
nor
is
the
name
altogether
misplaced
or
undeserved
the
mountain
being
exceeding
precipitous
and
its
beetling
rocky
sides
seeming
inaccessible
this
steepness
however
did
not
daunt
the
hero
of
the
poem
in
question
a
certain
sir
hilchen
von
lorch
a
saddle
said
to
have
belonged
to
him
is
still
preserved
in
the
town
but
on
what
manner
of
steed
he
was
wont
to
ride
is
not
told
explicitly
and
truly
it
must
have
been
a
veritable
bucephalus
for
the
nameless
poet
relates
that
sir
hilchen
being
enamoured
of
a
lady
whom
angry
gnomes
had
carried
to
the
top
of
kedrich
and
imprisoned
there
rode
at
full
gallop
right
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
rescued
the
fair
one
my
to
a
tower
be
whose
top
the
eagle
might
fail
to
gain
nor
portal
of
iron
nor
height
shall
bar
me
out
from
her
presence
bright
why
has
love
wings
but
that
he
may
fly
over
the
walls
be
they
never
so
high
so
the
tale
begins
while
at
the
end
the
knight
is
represented
exulting
in
his
doughty
action
hurrah
gallantly
done
the
spell
is
broken
the
bride
is
won
from
the
magic
hold
of
the
down
she
comes
with
her
dauntless
knight
holy
bernard
shield
us
all
from
the
wrath
of
the
elves
of
the
andernach
there
are
several
different
versions
of
this
legend
each
of
them
just
as
extraordinary
as
the
foregoing
it
is
evident
moreover
that
matter
of
this
sort
appealed
very
keenly
to
the
medieval
dwellers
by
the
rhine
much
of
the
further
legendary
lore
encircling
the
river
being
concerned
with
deeds
no
less
amazing
than
this
of
sir
and
among
things
which
recount
such
events
a
notable
instance
is
a
poem
consecrated
to
the
castle
of
andernach
here
once
upon
a
time
dwelt
a
count
bearing
the
now
famous
name
of
siegfried
and
being
of
a
religious
disposition
he
threw
in
his
lot
with
a
band
of
crusaders
for
a
long
while
in
consequence
he
was
absent
from
his
ancestral
domain
and
at
length
returning
thither
he
was
told
by
various
lying
tongues
that
his
beautiful
wife
genofeva
had
been
unfaithful
to
him
in
his
absence
the
chief
bearer
of
the
fell
news
being
one
golo
this
slanderer
induced
siegfried
to
banish
genofeva
straightway
and
so
the
lady
fled
from
the
castle
to
the
neighbouring
forest
of
laach
where
a
little
later
she
gave
birth
to
a
boy
thenceforth
mother
and
son
lived
together
in
the
wilds
and
though
these
were
infested
by
wild
robbers
and
full
of
wolves
and
other
ravening
beasts
the
pair
of
exiles
contrived
to
go
unscathed
year
after
year
while
more
wonderful
still
they
managed
to
find
daily
sustenance
and
now
romance
reached
a
happy
moment
for
behold
count
siegfried
went
hunting
one
day
in
the
remoter
parts
of
the
forest
and
fortuitously
he
passed
by
the
very
place
where
the
two
wanderers
were
wife
and
the
child
whom
he
had
never
seen
in
the
woody
vales
of
laach
the
horn
is
wound
and
fairly
flies
the
falcon
and
deeply
bays
the
hound
but
little
recks
count
siegfried
for
hawk
or
quarry
now
a
weight
is
on
his
noble
heart
a
gloom
is
on
his
brow
oh
he
hath
driven
from
his
can
not
from
his
a
lady
ah
the
loveliest
of
all
her
lovely
kind
his
wife
his
genofeva
at
the
word
of
one
the
blackest
traitor
ever
looked
upon
the
blessed
sun
he
hath
let
the
hunters
hurry
by
and
turned
his
steed
aside
and
ridden
where
the
blue
lake
spreads
its
waters
calm
and
wide
and
lo
beneath
a
there
sits
a
lady
fair
but
like
some
savage
maiden
clad
in
sylvan
pageant
rare
her
of
the
dappled
skin
of
the
rapid
mountain
roe
a
quiver
at
her
back
she
bears
beside
her
lies
a
bow
her
feet
are
bare
her
golden
hair
adown
her
shoulders
streams
and
in
her
lap
a
rosy
child
is
smiling
in
its
dreams
the
count
had
never
thought
to
see
his
wife
again
he
imagined
that
she
had
long
since
starved
to
death
or
been
devoured
and
now
finding
her
alive
his
pulses
quicken
he
knows
well
that
only
a
miracle
could
have
preserved
her
during
all
this
period
of
estrangement
and
reflects
that
on
behalf
of
the
virtuous
alone
are
miracles
worked
seeing
herein
ample
proof
of
innocence
he
welcomes
her
back
to
his
arms
and
with
beating
heart
bears
her
to
the
castle
oh
there
was
joy
in
andernach
upon
that
happy
night
the
palace
rang
with
revelry
the
city
blazed
with
light
and
when
the
moon
her
paler
beams
upon
the
turrets
shed
above
the
roman
gate
was
seen
the
traitor
head
the
brothers
doubtless
it
was
the
thaumaturgic
element
in
this
pretty
romance
which
chiefly
made
it
popular
among
its
pristine
audiences
yet
it
was
probably
the
pathos
with
which
it
is
coloured
that
granted
it
longevity
causing
it
to
be
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
long
before
the
advent
of
the
pathos
of
course
figures
largely
in
all
and
the
story
of
count
siegfried
is
by
no
means
the
only
tale
of
a
touching
nature
embodied
in
the
early
poetry
of
the
rhine
another
similar
work
which
belongs
to
this
category
being
a
poem
associated
with
liebenstein
and
sterrenberg
two
castles
not
far
from
each
other
these
places
so
goes
the
tale
once
belonged
to
a
nobleman
who
chanced
to
have
as
his
ward
a
young
lady
of
singular
loveliness
he
had
also
two
sons
of
whom
the
elder
was
heir
to
liebenstein
while
the
younger
was
destined
to
inherit
sterrenberg
these
brothers
were
fast
friends
and
this
partitioning
of
the
paternal
estates
never
begot
so
much
as
an
angry
word
between
them
but
alas
in
an
evil
day
they
both
fell
in
love
with
the
same
ward
such
events
have
happened
often
and
usually
they
have
ended
in
bitter
strife
but
the
elder
of
the
young
men
was
of
magnanimous
temperament
and
convinced
that
the
lady
favoured
the
advances
more
than
his
he
left
him
to
woo
and
win
her
and
so
in
due
course
it
was
announced
that
the
younger
brother
and
she
were
affianced
anon
the
date
fixed
for
their
nuptials
drew
near
but
it
happened
that
in
the
interim
the
young
knight
of
sterrenberg
had
become
infected
with
a
desire
to
join
a
crusade
and
now
despite
the
entreaties
of
his
fiancée
and
his
father
he
mustered
a
troop
of
led
them
to
join
the
emperor
conrad
at
frankfort
and
set
off
for
the
holy
land
year
after
year
went
by
still
the
warrior
was
absent
and
betimes
his
friends
and
relations
began
to
lose
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
again
imagining
that
he
must
have
fallen
at
the
hands
of
the
infidel
yet
this
suspicion
was
never
actually
confirmed
and
the
elder
brother
far
from
taking
the
advantage
which
the
strange
situation
offered
continued
to
eschew
paying
any
addresses
to
his
intended
bride
and
invariably
treated
her
simply
as
a
beloved
sister
sometimes
no
doubt
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
win
her
yet
but
of
a
sudden
his
horizon
was
changed
totally
and
changed
in
a
most
unexpected
fashion
the
rover
came
back
and
lo
it
was
not
merely
a
tale
of
war
that
he
brought
with
him
for
it
transpired
that
while
abroad
he
had
proved
false
to
his
vows
and
taken
to
himself
a
wife
a
damsel
of
grecian
birth
who
was
even
now
in
his
train
the
knight
of
liebenstein
was
bitterly
incensed
on
hearing
the
news
and
sent
his
brother
a
fierce
challenge
to
meet
him
in
single
combat
but
scarcely
had
they
met
and
drawn
swords
ere
the
injured
lady
intervened
she
reminded
the
young
men
of
their
sacred
bond
of
fraternity
she
implored
them
to
desist
from
the
crime
of
bloodshed
then
having
averted
this
she
experienced
a
great
longing
to
renounce
all
earthly
things
and
took
the
veil
in
a
neighbouring
convent
thus
shattering
for
ever
the
rekindled
hopes
of
her
elder
suitor
but
he
the
hero
of
the
drama
was
not
the
only
sufferer
for
his
brother
was
not
to
go
unpunished
for
his
perfidy
a
strange
tale
went
forth
a
scandalous
tale
to
the
effect
that
the
grecian
damsel
was
unfaithful
to
her
spouse
sterrenberg
began
to
rue
his
marriage
and
ultimately
was
forced
to
banish
his
wife
altogether
and
so
each
in
his
their
father
was
now
two
knights
lived
on
brooding
often
on
the
curious
events
of
which
their
lives
had
been
composed
the
elder
never
married
and
the
younger
had
no
inclination
to
take
that
step
a
second
time
they
never
entered
court
or
town
nor
looked
on
face
but
childless
to
the
grave
went
down
the
last
of
all
their
race
and
still
upon
the
mountain
fair
are
seen
two
castles
grey
that
like
their
lords
together
there
sink
slowly
to
decay
the
gust
that
shakes
the
tottering
stone
on
one
battlement
upon
the
rampart
lone
hath
equal
fury
spent
and
when
through
shattered
wall
the
misty
moonbeams
shine
upon
the
crumbling
walls
they
fall
of
dreary
liebenstein
this
legend
is
recounted
here
to
illustrate
the
poetry
of
the
rhine
a
variant
of
it
is
given
on
argenfels
but
the
warriors
who
flit
across
the
lore
of
rhineland
were
not
all
so
unfortunate
and
one
who
fared
better
was
sir
dietrich
of
schwarzenbeck
marching
by
the
rhine
on
his
way
to
join
a
band
of
crusaders
this
dietrich
chanced
to
pass
a
few
days
at
the
castle
of
argenfels
whose
owner
was
the
father
of
two
daughters
the
younger
of
the
pair
bertha
by
name
soon
fell
in
love
with
the
guest
while
he
too
was
deeply
impressed
by
her
charm
but
silken
dalliance
was
not
for
him
at
was
he
not
under
a
vow
to
try
to
redeem
the
holy
sepulchre
so
he
resumed
his
journey
to
palestine
here
an
arduous
campaign
awaited
him
in
the
course
of
a
fierce
battle
he
was
wounded
sorely
and
while
trying
to
escape
from
the
field
he
was
taken
prisoner
this
was
a
terrible
fate
a
far
worse
fate
than
death
for
the
saracens
usually
sold
their
captives
as
slaves
and
sir
dietrich
as
he
languished
in
captivity
wondering
whether
he
was
destined
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
serving
the
infidel
in
some
menial
capacity
vowed
that
if
he
should
ever
regain
his
native
germany
he
would
build
there
a
chapel
to
peter
nor
did
his
piety
go
unrewarded
for
shortly
afterward
a
body
of
his
compatriots
came
to
his
aid
worsted
his
foes
and
set
him
free
a
joyful
day
was
this
for
the
crusader
but
it
was
not
his
pious
vow
that
he
thought
of
first
he
made
for
argenfels
eager
to
see
again
the
bright
eyes
of
the
lady
who
had
enchanted
him
day
and
night
he
rode
and
as
he
drew
nearer
to
the
castle
his
passion
grew
stronger
within
him
but
alas
on
reaching
his
destination
his
hopes
were
suddenly
dashed
to
the
ground
war
had
meantime
been
waged
in
the
neighbourhood
of
home
her
father
had
been
involved
his
castle
burnt
to
the
ground
and
the
two
daughters
had
disappeared
peradventure
they
had
perished
surmised
the
knight
but
he
swore
he
would
leave
nothing
undone
which
might
lead
to
the
restoration
of
his
beloved
making
inquiries
far
and
near
throughout
the
country
he
heard
at
last
from
an
old
shepherd
that
two
ladies
of
gentle
birth
were
sequestering
themselves
in
a
disused
hermitage
near
the
summit
of
a
mountain
called
stromberg
it
indeed
they
thought
sir
dietrich
he
clambered
up
the
rocky
steep
leading
to
the
hermitage
and
a
wistful
sound
greeted
his
ears
the
sound
of
voices
offering
up
vespers
maria
stella
maris
they
sang
and
in
the
coolness
of
the
evening
the
notes
vibrated
with
a
new
strange
loveliness
for
the
lover
knew
that
he
had
not
climbed
the
stromberg
in
vain
he
returned
bringing
bertha
with
him
and
in
due
course
she
became
his
bride
yet
the
fairest
rose
has
its
thorns
and
the
happiness
of
the
pair
was
not
to
be
wholly
undimmed
by
clouds
for
sister
showing
a
curious
perversity
expressed
a
desire
to
remain
in
the
abode
which
had
sheltered
her
of
late
and
nothing
could
induce
her
to
alter
this
decision
sir
dietrich
pleaded
with
her
again
and
again
and
of
a
sudden
while
thus
engaged
he
thought
of
the
vow
he
had
made
while
a
vow
he
had
not
kept
here
in
this
shadow
darkening
the
joy
of
his
a
message
from
on
high
so
straightway
he
built
his
chapel
choosing
as
situation
therefor
a
spot
hard
by
the
windswept
hermitage
and
in
this
shrine
to
peter
dwelt
sister
to
the
end
of
her
days
was
it
mayhap
jealousy
and
a
dart
from
bow
which
kept
her
there
and
was
she
too
enamoured
of
sir
dietrich
well
the
poet
who
tells
the
story
certainly
thought
so
drinking
songs
of
the
rhine
it
were
a
lengthy
matter
to
recount
the
many
other
poems
of
rhineland
akin
to
those
mustered
above
and
enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
their
general
characteristics
while
an
ancient
rhine
classic
of
yet
a
different
kind
the
mouse
tower
given
elsewhere
is
so
familiar
owing
to
english
version
that
it
were
superfluous
to
offer
any
synopsis
or
criticism
of
it
here
then
a
class
of
poems
of
which
the
great
early
literature
is
naturally
replete
are
those
concerned
with
the
growing
of
the
vine
and
the
making
of
rhenish
prominent
among
these
being
one
consecrated
to
bacharach
a
town
which
was
a
famous
centre
of
the
wine
industry
in
the
middle
ages
near
bacharach
there
is
a
huge
stone
in
the
rhine
which
known
as
altar
of
bacchus
is
visible
only
on
rare
occasions
when
the
river
chances
to
be
particularly
low
and
in
olden
times
whenever
this
stone
was
seen
the
event
was
hailed
by
the
townsfolk
as
an
omen
that
their
next
grape
harvest
would
be
an
exceptionally
successful
one
it
is
with
this
of
that
the
poem
in
question
deals
but
coming
to
modern
times
many
of
the
rhine
drinking
songs
are
also
concerned
to
some
extent
with
element
which
seems
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
bacchanal
the
world
over
a
typical
item
in
this
category
is
the
rheinweinlied
of
georg
hervegh
a
poet
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
better
patriotic
song
of
however
is
one
by
a
slightly
earlier
poet
wolfgang
müller
a
native
of
königswinter
near
bonn
who
sings
with
passionate
devotion
of
the
great
river
dwelling
lovingly
on
its
natural
beauties
and
exalting
it
above
all
other
streams
his
song
appears
to
have
been
composed
when
the
writer
was
undergoing
a
temporary
period
of
exile
from
the
vaterland
for
a
somewhat
pathetic
and
plaintive
air
pervades
each
verse
and
the
poet
refers
to
the
rhine
as
a
memory
rather
than
as
something
actually
before
his
eyes
but
very
different
is
another
fine
patriotic
song
of
which
it
behoves
to
speak
the
work
of
august
kopisch
a
contemporary
of
müller
this
latter
song
treats
of
an
incident
in
the
napoleonic
wars
and
blücher
and
his
forces
are
represented
as
encamped
on
the
rhine
and
as
debating
whether
to
march
forward
against
their
french
foes
nor
is
it
necessary
to
add
perhaps
that
they
decide
to
do
so
for
otherwise
no
german
singer
would
have
handled
the
theme
but
what
asks
someone
is
really
the
brightest
gem
of
rhineland
poetry
while
someone
else
adds
that
the
majority
of
the
writers
cited
above
are
but
little
known
and
inquires
whether
none
of
the
great
german
authors
were
ever
inspired
to
song
by
their
beloved
river
the
name
of
heinrich
heine
naturally
comes
to
mind
in
this
to
mind
instantly
on
account
of
what
is
surely
his
masterpiece
die
poem
already
dealt
with
but
version
far
transcends
all
others
and
pondering
on
its
beauty
we
think
first
of
its
gentle
andante
music
a
music
which
steals
through
the
senses
like
a
subtle
perfume
ich
weiss
nicht
was
soll
es
bedeuten
dass
ich
so
traurig
bin
ein
märchen
aus
alten
zeiten
das
kommt
mir
nicht
aus
dem
sinn
there
surely
is
a
sound
as
lovely
as
the
fateful
maiden
herself
ever
sang
and
here
again
is
a
verse
which
is
a
tour
de
force
in
the
craft
of
for
not
only
are
the
externals
of
the
scene
summoned
vividly
before
the
eyes
but
some
of
the
mystery
and
strangely
wistful
appeal
of
nature
are
likewise
found
in
the
lines

of
the
knight
of

who
came
to
the
succour
of
the
youthful

is
based
upon
motives
more
or
less
common
in
enchantment
of
human
beings
into

the

the

the

to
his
identity

to
look
upon

myth

been
treated
by
both
french
and
german
romancers

the
latter
attached
it
loosely
to
the

turning

mystical
use

found

of

and
other

note

of

articles
and

note
op
cit
the
knight
of
the
swan
in
a
dungeon
in
the
castle
of
cleves
lay
elsa
of
brabant
languishing
in
captivity
her
father
the
duke
of
brabant
had
ere
he
died
appointed
his
most
powerful
vassal
one
frederick
of
telramund
to
be
her
guardian
but
he
seeking
only
the
advancement
of
his
own
ends
shamefully
abused
the
confidence
of
his
lord
using
his
authority
as
guardian
he
sought
to
compel
her
to
become
his
wife
and
threw
her
into
prison
to
await
the
knowing
well
that
none
would
dare
to
dispute
his
action
an
appeal
was
made
on
behalf
to
the
emperor
henry
i
who
decreed
that
she
should
choose
a
champion
so
that
the
matter
might
be
settled
by
combat
but
alas
there
was
not
a
knight
who
would
venture
to
match
his
skill
against
that
of
frederick
who
was
a
giant
in
stature
and
an
expert
in
in
accordance
with
the
decree
telramund
sent
out
a
herald
at
stated
times
to
proclaim
his
readiness
to
do
battle
with
any
who
would
champion
the
cause
of
elsa
time
passed
yet
the
challenge
was
not
accepted
and
at
length
the
day
was
fixed
for
the
bridal
behind
her
prison
bars
the
lady
wept
ceaselessly
and
called
upon
the
virgin
to
save
her
from
the
threatened
fate
in
her
despair
she
beat
her
breast
with
her
chaplet
whereon
was
hung
a
tiny
silver
bell
now
this
little
bell
was
possessed
of
magic
properties
for
when
it
was
rung
the
sound
small
at
first
as
the
tinkling
of
a
fairy
lure
grew
in
volume
the
further
it
travelled
till
it
resembled
the
swelling
of
a
mighty
chorus
rarely
was
its
tone
heard
and
never
save
when
its
owner
was
in
dire
straits
as
on
the
present
occasion
when
elsa
beat
her
breast
with
it
therefore
its
magical
qualities
responded
to
her
distress
and
its
faint
sweet
tinkle
fell
on
her
ear
far
away
over
hill
and
dale
went
the
sound
of
the
bell
growing
ever
richer
and
louder
till
at
length
it
reached
the
temple
where
parsifal
and
his
knights
guarded
the
holy
grail
to
them
it
seemed
that
the
swelling
notes
contained
an
appeal
for
help
directed
to
the
holy
vessel
over
which
they
kept
vigil
while
they
debated
thereon
a
loud
and
mysterious
voice
was
heard
bidding
parsifal
send
his
son
lohengrin
to
the
rescue
of
elsa
of
brabant
whom
he
must
take
for
his
wife
yet
without
revealing
to
her
his
identity
the
awed
knights
recognized
the
voice
as
that
of
the
holy
grail
and
lohengrin
at
once
set
out
bound
he
knew
not
whither
when
he
reached
the
shores
of
the
rhine
he
found
awaiting
him
a
boat
drawn
by
a
stately
swan
taking
it
as
a
sign
from
heaven
he
stepped
into
the
little
boat
and
was
carried
up
the
rhine
to
the
sound
of
the
most
exquisite
music
it
was
the
day
on
which
elsa
was
to
be
wedded
to
her
tyrant
she
had
spent
the
night
in
tears
and
bitter
lamentations
and
now
weary
and
distraught
too
hopeless
even
for
tears
she
looked
out
from
the
bars
of
her
prison
with
dull
despairing
eyes
suddenly
she
heard
the
melodious
strains
and
a
moment
later
saw
the
approach
of
a
boat
wherein
lay
a
sleeping
knight
hope
leapt
within
her
for
she
remembered
the
prophecy
of
an
old
nun
long
since
dead
that
a
sleeping
knight
would
rescue
her
from
grave
peril
directly
he
stepped
ashore
the
youth
made
his
way
to
the
place
of
her
confinement
and
espying
her
face
at
the
heavily
barred
window
knelt
before
her
and
begged
that
she
would
take
him
for
her
champion
at
that
moment
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
was
heard
followed
by
the
voice
of
the
herald
as
for
the
last
time
he
challenged
any
knight
to
take
up
arms
on
behalf
of
elsa
of
brabant
lohengrin
boldly
accepted
the
challenge
and
telramund
when
the
news
reached
him
of
the
unexpected
opposition
on
the
very
day
he
had
appointed
for
his
wedding
was
surprised
and
enraged
beyond
measure
yet
he
dared
not
refuse
to
do
battle
with
the
stranger
knight
because
of
the
decree
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
combat
should
take
place
immediately
news
of
it
reached
the
people
of
cleves
and
a
great
concourse
gathered
to
witness
the
spectacle
all
of
them
secretly
in
sympathy
with
the
persecuted
maiden
though
these
feelings
were
carefully
concealed
from
the
ruthless
telramund
fierce
indeed
was
the
combat
for
lohengrin
though
less
powerfully
built
than
his
gigantic
opponent
was
nevertheless
tall
and
strong
and
well
versed
in
the
arts
of
war
at
length
he
laid
his
enemy
in
the
dust
with
a
and
the
crowd
broke
into
cheers
the
combat
was
over
and
elsa
was
free
heeding
not
the
acclamations
of
the
people
lohengrin
strode
toward
elsa
and
again
knelt
at
her
feet
the
blushing
maiden
bade
him
name
his
reward
whereupon
the
knight
begged
her
hand
in
marriage
confessing
however
that
he
might
only
remain
with
her
so
long
as
she
did
not
question
him
with
regard
to
his
identity
it
seemed
a
small
condition
to
elsa
who
willingly
promised
to
restrain
any
curiosity
she
might
feel
concerning
his
name
and
place
of
abode
the
cheers
of
the
populace
were
redoubled
when
they
learned
that
elsa
was
to
bestow
her
hand
on
the
swan
knight
in
a
few
weeks
the
couple
were
married
and
henceforth
for
a
good
many
years
they
lived
together
very
happily
three
sons
were
born
to
them
who
grew
in
time
to
be
handsome
and
chivalrous
lads
of
noble
bearing
and
knightly
disposition
then
it
was
that
elsa
who
had
hitherto
faithfully
kept
her
promise
to
her
husband
began
to
fancy
that
she
and
her
sons
had
a
grievance
in
that
the
latter
were
not
permitted
to
bear
their
name
for
a
time
she
brooded
in
silence
over
her
grievance
but
at
length
it
was
fanned
into
open
rebellion
by
a
breath
of
outside
suspicion
some
of
the
people
looked
askance
at
the
knight
whose
name
no
one
knew
so
elsa
openly
reproached
her
husband
with
his
secrecy
and
begged
that
for
the
benefit
of
their
sons
he
would
reveal
his
name
and
station
even
the
children
of
humble
parents
the
children
of
the
peasants
of
their
own
retainers
had
a
right
to
their
name
and
why
not
her
sons
also
lohengrin
paled
at
her
foolish
words
for
to
him
they
were
the
sign
that
he
must
leave
his
wife
and
family
and
betake
himself
once
more
to
the
temple
of
the
holy
grail
elsa
he
said
sorrowfully
knowest
not
what
thou
hast
done
thy
promise
is
broken
and
i
must
leave
thee
for
and
with
that
he
blew
a
blast
on
his
silver
horn
elsa
had
already
repented
her
rash
words
and
right
earnestly
she
besought
him
to
remain
by
her
side
but
alas
her
tears
and
pleadings
were
in
vain
for
even
as
her
entreaties
were
uttered
she
heard
the
exquisite
strains
of
music
which
had
first
heralded
her
approach
while
from
the
window
of
the
castle
she
espied
the
rapidly
drawing
toward
the
shore
with
grave
tenderness
lohengrin
bade
farewell
to
his
wife
and
family
first
however
revealing
to
them
his
identity
and
commending
them
to
the
care
of
some
of
his
trusty
followers
tradition
tells
that
elsa
did
not
long
survive
the
loss
of
her
beloved
husband
but
her
sons
became
brave
knights
well
worthy
of
the
proud
name
they
bore
a
legend
of
liége
a
legend
of
liége
and
is
not
liége
itself
now
almost
legendary
its
venerable
church
its
library
replete
with
the
priceless
treasures
of
the
past
records
stored
of
deeds
long
since
forgot
where
are
they
crumbling
clusters
of
ruins
fired
by
the
barbarian
torch
whose
glow
we
were
told
was
to
enlighten
an
ignorant
and
uncultured
europe
but
one
gem
remains
the
wonderful
hôtel
de
ville
type
of
the
renaissance
spirit
in
flanders
liége
may
be
laid
in
ruins
but
the
memory
of
what
it
was
can
never
die
athens
in
death
is
nobler
far
than
breathing
cities
of
the
west
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
those
splendours
in
stone
those
wonders
of
medieval
architecture
even
the
blackened
walls
of
which
possess
a
dignity
and
beauty
which
will
ever
assist
the
imagination
to
the
picture
of
what
has
been
liége
is
a
city
of
the
middle
ages
time
was
when
the
place
boasted
but
a
single
forge
and
though
bucklers
were
heaped
beside
the
anvil
and
swords
and
spears
lay
waiting
for
repair
the
blacksmith
leant
against
his
gazing
idly
up
the
gradually
he
was
aware
of
a
figure
which
seemed
to
have
grown
into
shape
from
a
or
to
have
risen
from
behind
a
stone
and
as
it
descended
the
slope
he
eyed
curiously
the
grimy
face
long
beard
and
squat
form
of
what
he
was
half
unwilling
to
recognize
as
a
human
being
hobbling
awkwardly
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
though
cold
the
man
came
in
time
to
the
smithy
door
jacques
when
work
is
to
be
done

idle

idle

quoth
jacques
as
idle
as
you
are
ugly
but
i
get
charcoal
any
more
than
you
can
get
beauty
so
i
must
stand
still
and
you
be
content
with
your
face
though
fain
earn
a
loaf
and
a
cup
full
enough
for
both
of
us
this
winter
though
the
strange
man
must
have
known
he
was
horribly
is
if
he
ever
bent
to
drink
of
the
clear
bright
waters
of
the
lovely
meuse
which
reflected
in
those
days
every
and
every
which
grew
upon
its
banks
and
gave
a
faithful
portraiture
in
its
cool
waters
of
every
creature
that
leant
over
he
was
certainly
the
most
frightful
creature
that
had
ever
met
the
sight
it
was
evident
enough
that
he
did
not
like
being
called
but
when
the
honest
smith
spoke
of
earning
a
draught
for
his
new
acquaintance
as
well
as
himself
he
smacked
his
ugly
lips
and
twisted
out
a
sort
of
smile
which
made
him
still
more
hideous
ah

he

and
he
pointed
with
a
yellow
finger
which
seemed
to
stretch
out
longer
and
longer
as
the
smith
strained
his
eyes
up
the
slope
until
the
digit
looked
quite
as
long
as
the
tallest
chimney
that
smoked
over
liége
listen
and
he
sang
in
a
voice
like
the
breath
of
a
huge
bellows

my
cup
of
my
cup
of
wine
as
he
ended
this
rude
chant
jacques
saw
the
long
finger
run
back
into
the
shrivelled
hand
as
a
telescope
slips
back
into
its
case
and
then
the
hand
was
wrapped
up
in
the
dingy
garment
and
with
a
dreadful
shiver
and
a
chattering
of
teeth
as
loud
as
the
noise
of
the
anvils
now
heard
on
the
same
spot
the
ugly
man
was
wafted
away
round
the
corner
of
the
building
like
a
thick
gust
of
smoke
from
a
newly
fed
furnace
my
cup
of
my
cup
of
wine
rang
again
in
the
ears
of
the
startled
jacques
and
after
running
several
times
round
his
house
in
vain
pursuit
of
the
voice
he
sat
down
on
the
cold
anvil
to
scratch
his
head
and
think
it
was
quite
certain
he
had
work
to
do
and
it
was
as
certain
as
half
a
score
searches
could
make
it
that
he
had
not
a
single
coin
in
his
pouch
to
buy
charcoal
to
do
it
with
he
was
reflecting
that
the
old
man
was
a
very
strange
was
more
than
half
afraid
to
think
who
he
might
in
the
midst
of
his
cogitation
he
heard
his
three
children
calling
out
for
their
morning
meal
not
a
loaf
had
jacques
in
store
and
twisting
his
hide
apron
round
his
loins
he
muttered
or
no
demon
go
and
strode
out
of
the
smithy
and
up
the
as
fast
as
though
he
feared
that
if
he
went
slowly
his
courage
would
not
carry
him
as
far
up
as
the
which
the
long
yellow
finger
had
pointed
out
when
the
young
wife
of
jacques
came
to
look
for
her
husband
she
saw
him
returning
with
his
apron
full
of
black
morsels
of
shining
stone
she
smiled
at
him
but
when
he
threw
them
on
the
furnace
and
went
to
get
a
brand
to
set
them
alight
she
looked
solemn
enough
for
she
thought
he
had
left
his
wits
on
the
great
was
her
surprise
when
she
saw
the
stones
burn
but
her
joy
was
greater
than
her
surprise
when
she
heard
her
hammer
ring
merrily
and
found
the
wage
of
the
smith
all
spared
for
home
use
instead
of
being
set
aside
for
the
that
night
jacques
had
two
full
and
setting
them
on
the
anvil
had
scarcely
said
to
himself
wonder
whether
come
when
in
walked
the
old
man
and
nodding
familiarly
seated
himself
on
the
head
of
the
big
hammer
jacques
was
a
bold
and
grateful
as
well
as
a
fellow
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
and
his
visitor
were
on
excellent
terms
no
more
shivering
or
chattering
of
teeth
was
seen
or
heard
in
the
smithy
that
night
the
black
stones
burned
away
merrily
on
the
hearth
and
the
bright
flames
shone
on
the
honest
face
of
the
smith
as
he
hobnobbed
with
his
companion
and
looked
as
though
he
really
thought
the
stranger
as
handsome
as
he
certainly
had
been
useful
he
sang
his
best
songs
and
told
his
best
stories
and
when
the
wine
had
melted
his
soul
he
told
his
new
friend
how
dearly
he
loved
his
wife
and
what
charming
dear
creatures
his
children
were
or
no
demon
he
swore
the
stranger
was
a
good
fellow
and
though
the
visitor
spoke
but
little
he
seemed
to
enjoy
his
company
very
much
he
laughed
at
the
jokes
smiled
at
the
songs
and
once
rather
startled
jacques
by
letting
out
again
his
long
telescope
arm
to
pat
him
on
his
shoulder
when
with
a
mouth
full
of
praises
of
his
wife
a
tear
sparkled
in
his
eye
as
he
told
over
again
how
dearly
he
loved
his
little
ones
day
broke
before
the
wine
was
exhausted
or
their
hearts
flagged
and
when
the
voice
of
the
early
cock
woke
the
swan
that
tended
her
callow
brood
amongst
the
sedges
of
the
meuse
the
old
man
departed
jacques
never
saw
him
again
although
he
often
looked
in
all
directions
when
he
went
to
the
hill
for
a
supply
of
fuel
but
from
that
day
liége
grew
up
in
industry
riches
and
power
jacques
had
found
coal
and
thus
became
the
benefactor
of
his
native
country
and
the
hero
of
this
favourite
legend
of
the
liégeois
the
of
solingen
in
solingen
where
the
forges
rang
to
the
making
of
many
smiths
had
essayed
to
imitate
the
falchions
of
damascus
their
trenchant
keenness
and
their
wondrous
golden
inlaying
but
numerous
as
were
the
attempts
made
to
recapture
the
ancient
secret
of
the
east
they
all
signally
failed
and
brought
about
the
ruin
of
many
masters
of
the
art
among
these
was
old
ruthard
a
smith
grown
grey
in
the
practice
of
his
trade
he
had
laid
aside
sufficient
savings
to
permit
himself
a
experiment
in
the
manufacture
of
damascus
blades
but
to
no
purpose
as
the
months
wore
on
he
saw
his
gold
melting
steadily
away
the
wrinkles
deepened
on
his
brow
and
his
only
daughter
martha
watched
the
change
coming
over
him
in
sorrowful
silence
one
evening
of
all
evenings
the
holy
christmas
entered
the
forge
and
saw
the
old
man
still
hard
at
work
she
gently
remonstrated
with
him
asking
him
why
he
toiled
on
such
an
occasion
work
my
father
as
if
you
feared
that
we
might
not
have
bread
she
said
toil
on
this
holy
evening
have
you
not
sufficient
for
the
future
you
must
have
laid
by
enough
for
your
old
age
then
why
fatigue
yourself
when
others
are
spending
the
time
by
their
own
hearths
in
cheerful
converse
the
old
only
reply
was
to
shake
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
take
some
pieces
of
broken
food
in
his
hands
and
leave
the
house
at
that
moment
wilhelm
the
head
apprentice
entered
the
room
he
seemed
pale
and
disturbed
and
related
to
martha
to
whom
he
was
betrothed
that
he
had
asked
ruthard
for
her
hand
the
old
man
had
firmly
told
him
that
he
could
not
consent
to
their
union
until
he
had
discovered
the
secret
of
making
damascus
blades
this
he
felt
was
hopeless
to
expect
and
he
had
come
to
say
ere
he
set
out
on
a
quest
from
which
he
might
never
return
at
the
news
martha
was
greatly
perturbed
she
rose
and
clung
to
the
young
man
her
wild
grief
venting
itself
in
heartrending
sobs
she
begged
him
not
to
depart
but
his
mind
was
fully
made
up
and
notwithstanding
her
tears
and
caresses
he
tore
himself
away
and
quitted
the
house
and
the
town
for
nearly
a
fortnight
the
youth
tramped
over
hill
and
valley
with
little
in
his
pouch
and
without
much
hope
that
the
slender
means
of
which
he
was
possessed
would
bring
him
to
the
land
of
the
saracens
where
alone
he
could
hope
to
learn
the
great
art
of
tempering
the
blades
of
damascus
one
evening
he
entered
the
solitary
mountain
country
of
spessart
and
unacquainted
with
the
labyrinths
of
the
road
lost
himself
in
an
adjoining
forest
by
this
time
night
had
fallen
and
he
cast
about
for
a
place
in
which
to
lay
his
head
but
the
inhospitable
forest
showed
no
sign
of
human
habitation
after
wandering
on
however
stumbling
and
falling
in
the
darkness
he
at
length
saw
a
light
burning
brightly
at
a
distance
quickly
he
made
for
it
and
found
that
it
came
from
the
window
of
a
cottage
at
the
door
of
which
he
knocked
loudly
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
an
answer
for
an
old
woman
speedily
opened
and
inquired
what
he
wanted
at
so
late
an
hour
he
told
her
that
he
desired
food
and
lodging
for
which
he
could
pay
and
he
was
at
once
admitted
she
told
him
however
that
she
expected
another
visitor
whilst
she
cooked
his
supper
wilhelm
detailed
to
her
the
circumstances
of
his
journey
after
he
had
eaten
he
retired
to
rest
but
tired
as
he
was
he
could
not
sleep
later
a
dreadful
storm
arose
through
the
din
of
which
he
heard
a
loud
noise
as
if
someone
had
entered
the
house
by
way
of
the
chimney
peering
through
the
keyhole
into
the
next
room
he
perceived
a
man
seated
at
the
table
opposite
his
hostess
whose
appearance
filled
him
with
misgiving
he
had
not
much
leisure
for
a
detailed
examination
of
this
person
however
for
the
such
she
to
the
door
of
his
room
entered
and
bade
him
come
and
be
introduced
to
a
stranger
from
the
east
who
could
tell
him
the
secret
of
forging
damascus
blades
wilhelm
followed
the
old
woman
into
the
other
room
and
beheld
there
a
swarthy
man
seated
wrapped
in
a
mantle
for
a
long
time
the
stranger
regarded
him
steadily
then
demanded
what
he
wanted
from
him
wilhelm
told
him
the
circumstances
of
his
quest
and
when
he
had
finished
the
story
the
man
laughed
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
document
requested
the
youth
to
sign
it
wilhelm
perceived
that
it
was
of
the
nature
of
a
pact
with
satan
by
which
he
was
to
surrender
his
soul
in
return
for
the
coveted
secret
nevertheless
he
set
his
signature
to
the
manuscript
and
returned
to
his
not
to
sleep
the
consequences
of
his
terrible
act
haunted
him
and
when
morning
came
he
set
off
on
his
homeward
journey
with
a
fearful
heart
carefully
guarding
a
letter
which
the
mysterious
stranger
had
put
into
his
hand
without
further
adventure
he
reached
solingen
and
having
acquainted
ruthard
with
what
had
transpired
he
handed
him
the
letter
but
the
good
old
man
refused
to
unseal
it
must
keep
this
until
your
own
son
and
my
grandson
can
open
it
he
said
to
wilhelm
over
his
infant
soul
the
enemy
can
have
no
and
so
it
happened
wilhelm
married
martha
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
a
little
son
was
born
to
them
who
in
due
time
found
the
letter
opened
it
and
mastered
the
satanic
secret
and
from
that
time
the
blades
of
solingen
have
had
a
renown
the
architect
of
cologne
cathedral
travellers
on
the
rhine
usually
make
a
halt
at
cologne
to
see
the
cathedral
and
many
inquire
the
name
of
its
creator
was
the
plan
the
work
of
a
single
architect
they
ask
or
did
the
cathedral
like
many
another
in
europe
acquire
its
present
form
by
slow
degrees
being
augmented
and
duly
embellished
in
divers
successive
ages
these
questions
are
perfectly
reasonable
and
natural
yet
strange
to
relate
are
invariably
answered
in
evasive
fashion
the
truth
being
that
the
name
of
the
artist
in
stone
who
planned
cologne
cathedral
is
unknown
the
legend
concerning
him
however
is
of
celebrity
for
the
tale
associated
with
the
founding
of
the
famous
edifice
is
replete
with
that
grisly
element
which
has
always
delighted
the
germans
and
figures
largely
in
their
medieval
literature
and
more
especially
in
the
works
of
their
early
example
dürer
lucas
cranach
and
albrecht
altdörfer
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
master
that
a
bishop
of
cologne
conrad
von
hochsteden
formed
the
resolve
of
increasing
the
pecuniary
value
of
his
diocese
he
was
already
rich
but
other
neighbouring
bishops
were
richer
each
of
them
being
blest
with
just
what
conrad
shrine
sufficiently
famous
to
attract
large
numbers
of
wealthy
pilgrims
able
to
make
generous
offerings
the
result
of
his
jealous
musing
was
that
the
crafty
bishop
vowed
he
would
build
a
cathedral
whose
like
had
not
been
seen
in
all
germany
by
this
means
he
thought
he
would
surely
contrive
to
bring
rich
men
to
his
diocese
his
first
thought
was
to
summon
an
architect
from
italy
in
those
days
the
country
where
beautiful
building
was
chiefly
carried
on
but
he
found
that
this
would
cost
a
far
larger
sum
than
he
was
capable
of
raising
so
hearing
that
a
gifted
young
german
architect
had
lately
taken
up
his
abode
at
cologne
itself
conrad
sent
for
him
and
offered
him
a
rich
reward
should
he
accomplish
the
work
satisfactorily
the
young
man
was
overjoyed
for
as
yet
he
had
received
no
commissions
of
great
importance
and
he
set
to
work
at
once
he
made
drawing
after
drawing
but
being
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
found
that
his
hand
had
lost
its
cunning
none
of
his
designs
pleased
him
in
the
least
the
bishop
he
felt
would
be
equally
disappointed
and
thinking
that
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
might
clear
his
brain
he
threw
his
aside
and
repaired
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
yet
even
here
peace
did
not
come
to
him
he
was
tormented
by
endless
visions
of
groined
arches
pediments
pilasters
and
the
like
and
having
a
stick
in
his
hand
he
made
an
effort
to
trace
some
on
the
sand
but
this
new
effort
pleased
him
no
better
than
any
of
its
predecessors
fame
and
fortune
were
within
his
reach
yet
he
was
incapable
of
grasping
them
and
he
groaned
aloud
cursing
the
day
he
was
born
as
the
young
man
uttered
his
fierce
malediction
he
was
surprised
to
hear
a
loud
pronounced
he
looked
round
wondering
from
whom
this
insolence
came
and
beheld
an
individual
whose
approach
he
had
not
noticed
he
too
was
engaged
in
drawing
on
the
sand
and
deeming
that
the
person
whoever
he
was
intended
to
mock
his
attempts
at
a
plan
for
the
projected
cathedral
the
architect
strode
up
to
him
with
an
angry
expression
on
his
face
he
stopped
short
however
on
nearing
the
rival
draughtsman
for
he
was
repelled
by
his
sinister
aspect
while
at
the
same
time
he
was
thunderstruck
by
the
excellence
of
his
drawing
it
was
indeed
a
thaumaturgic
design
just
such
a
one
as
the
architect
himself
had
dreamt
of
but
had
been
unable
to
execute
and
while
he
gazed
at
it
eagerly
the
stranger
hailed
him
in
an
ugly
rasping
voice
cunning
device
this
of
mine
he
said
sharply
and
the
architect
was
bound
to
agree
despite
the
jealousy
he
felt
surely
he
thought
only
the
evil
one
could
draw
in
this
wise
scarcely
had
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
ere
his
suspicion
was
confirmed
for
now
he
marked
the
tail
artfully
concealed
hitherto
yet
he
was
incapable
of
withholding
his
gaze
from
the
plan
drawn
so
wondrously
on
the
sand
and
the
foul
fiend
seeing
that
the
moment
for
his
triumph
was
come
declared
his
identity
without
shame
and
added
that
would
the
architect
but
agree
to
renounce
all
hopes
of
salvation
in
the
next
world
the
peerless
design
would
be
his
to
do
with
as
he
pleased
the
young
man
shuddered
on
receiving
the
momentous
offer
but
continued
to
gaze
fixedly
at
the
cunning
workmanship
and
again
the
evil
one
addressed
him
bidding
him
repair
that
very
night
to
a
certain
place
on
a
blasted
heath
where
if
he
would
sign
a
document
consigning
his
soul
to
everlasting
damnation
he
would
be
presented
with
the
plan
duly
drawn
on
parchment
the
architect
still
wavered
now
eager
to
accept
the
offer
and
now
vowing
that
the
stipulated
price
was
too
frightful
in
the
end
he
was
given
time
wherein
to
come
to
a
decision
and
he
hurried
from
the
place
at
hot
speed
as
the
tempter
vanished
from
his
sight
on
reaching
his
dwelling
the
architect
flung
himself
upon
his
bed
and
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
weeping
the
good
woman
who
tended
him
observed
this
with
great
surprise
for
he
was
not
given
to
showing
his
emotions
thus
and
wondering
what
terrible
sorrow
had
come
to
him
she
proceeded
to
make
kindly
inquiries
at
first
these
were
met
with
silence
but
feeling
a
need
for
sympathy
the
architect
eventually
confessed
the
truth
and
the
good
dame
horrified
at
what
she
heard
hurried
off
to
impart
the
story
to
her
he
too
was
shocked
but
he
was
as
anxious
as
bishop
conrad
that
the
proposed
cathedral
should
be
duly
built
and
he
came
quickly
to
the
presence
he
told
him
a
piece
of
our
cross
this
will
preserve
you
go
therefore
as
the
fiend
directed
you
take
the
drawing
from
him
and
brandish
the
sacred
relic
in
his
accursed
face
the
moment
you
have
received
when
evening
drew
near
the
architect
hurried
to
the
rendezvous
where
he
found
the
devil
waiting
impatiently
but
a
leer
soon
spread
over
his
visage
and
he
was
evidently
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
wrecking
a
soul
he
quickly
produced
a
weird
document
commanding
his
victim
to
affix
his
signature
at
a
certain
place
the
beautiful
plan
whispered
the
young
man
must
see
it
first
i
must
be
assured
that
the
drawing
on
the
sand
has
been
faithfully
the
devil
handed
over
the
precious
piece
of
vellum
and
glancing
at
it
swiftly
and
finding
it
in
order
the
architect
whipped
it
under
his
doublet
you
can
not
outwit
me
shrieked
the
fiend
but
as
he
was
laying
hands
upon
the
architect
the
young
man
brought
forth
the
talisman
he
carried
priest
has
told
you
of
this
for
no
one
else
would
have
thought
of
it
cried
the
devil
breathing
flame
from
his
nostrils
but
his
wrath
availed
him
naught
he
was
forced
to
retreat
before
the
sacred
relic
yet
as
he
stepped
backward
he
uttered
a
deadly
curse
have
deceived
me
he
hissed
know
that
fame
will
never
come
to
you
your
name
will
be
forgotten
for
and
behold
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
the
cathedral
was
scarcely
completed
ere
the
young
name
became
irrevocably
forgotten
and
now
this
grisly
tale
is
all
that
is
known
concerning
his
identity
cologne
cathedral
its
erection
there
are
several
other
tales
to
account
for
the
belief
prevalent
at
one
time
that
cologne
cathedral
would
never
be
completed
the
following
legend
attributes
the
unfinished
state
of
the
edifice
to
the
curse
of
a
jealous
architect
at
the
time
the
building
was
commenced
a
rival
architect
was
engaged
in
planning
an
aqueduct
to
convey
to
the
city
a
supply
of
water
purer
than
that
of
the
rhine
he
was
in
this
difficulty
however
he
had
been
unable
to
discover
the
exact
position
of
the
spring
from
which
the
water
was
to
be
drawn
tidings
of
the
proposed
structure
reached
the
ears
of
the
builder
of
the
cathedral
a
man
of
strong
passions
and
jealous
disposition
and
in
time
the
other
architect
asked
his
opinion
of
the
plans
for
the
aqueduct
now
it
so
happened
that
the
architect
of
the
cathedral
alone
had
known
the
situation
of
the
spring
and
he
had
communicated
it
to
his
wife
but
to
no
other
living
creature
so
he
replied
boastfully
not
to
me
of
your
aqueduct
my
cathedral
mighty
as
it
will
be
shall
be
completed
before
your
little
and
he
clinched
his
vainglorious
assertion
with
an
oath
indeed
it
seemed
as
though
his
boast
would
be
justified
for
the
building
of
the
sacred
edifice
proceeded
apace
while
the
aqueduct
was
not
even
begun
because
of
the
difficulty
of
finding
the
spring
the
second
architect
was
in
despair
for
of
a
certainty
his
professional
reputation
was
destroyed
his
hopes
of
fame
for
ever
dashed
were
he
unable
to
finish
the
task
he
had
undertaken
his
faithful
wife
strove
to
lighten
his
despondency
and
at
last
setting
her
wit
to
work
hit
on
a
plan
whereby
the
threatened
calamity
might
be
averted
she
set
out
to
visit
the
wife
of
the
rival
architect
with
whom
she
was
intimate
the
hostess
greeted
her
effusively
and
the
ladies
had
a
long
chat
over
bygone
times
more
and
more
confidential
did
they
become
under
the
influence
of
old
memories
and
cherry
wine
skilfully
the
guest
led
the
conversation
round
to
the
subject
of
the
hidden
spring
and
her
friend
after
exacting
a
promise
of
the
strictest
secrecy
told
her
its
exact
situation
it
lay
under
the
great
tower
of
the
cathedral
covered
by
the
massive
stone
known
as
the
me
have
your
assurance
again
said
the
anxious
lady
you
will
never
tell
anyone
not
even
your
husband
for
i
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
me
if
my
husband
learnt
that
i
had
told
it
to
the
other
renewed
her
promises
of
secrecy
and
took
her
leave
on
her
return
home
she
promptly
told
her
husband
all
that
had
passed
and
he
as
promptly
set
to
work
sunk
a
well
at
the
spot
indicated
and
found
the
spring
the
foundations
of
the
aqueduct
were
laid
and
the
structure
itself
soon
sprang
up
the
architect
of
the
cathedral
saw
with
dismay
that
his
secret
was
discovered
as
the
building
of
the
aqueduct
progressed
he
lost
all
interest
in
his
own
work
envy
and
anger
filled
his
thoughts
and
at
last
overcame
him
it
is
said
that
he
died
of
a
broken
heart
cursing
with
his
latest
breath
the
cathedral
which
he
had
planned
the
wager
an
alternative
story
is
that
of
the
wager
with
the
architect
of
the
cathedral
the
evil
one
was
much
irritated
at
the
good
progress
made
in
the
erection
of
the
building
and
resolved
by
means
of
a
cunning
artifice
to
stop
that
progress
to
this
end
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
architect
travelling
incognito
to
avoid
unpleasant
attentions
the
architect
was
a
man
of
wit
and
good
sense
as
courteous
as
he
was
clever
but
he
had
one
outstanding
love
of
wagering
satan
who
ever
loves
to
find
the
joints
in
an
armour
chose
this
one
weak
spot
as
a
point
of
attack
his
host
offered
him
meat
and
drink
which
the
devil
declined
as
not
being
sufficiently
for
his
taste
have
come
on
a
matter
of
business
said
he
briskly
have
heard
of
you
as
a
sporting
fellow
a
man
who
loves
his
wager
is
that
correct
the
architect
indicated
that
it
was
and
was
all
eagerness
and
attention
in
a
moment
said
the
other
have
come
in
a
word
to
make
a
bet
with
you
concerning
the
what
is
your
wager
wager
that
i
bring
a
stream
from
treves
to
cologne
before
you
finish
the
cathedral
and
work
said
the
delighted
architect
the
wager
i
win
your
soul
passes
into
my
possession
if
you
win
you
may
have
anything
you
and
with
that
he
was
gone
next
day
the
architect
procured
the
services
of
all
the
builders
that
were
to
be
had
on
such
short
notice
and
set
them
to
work
in
real
earnest
very
soon
the
whole
town
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
because
of
the
unusual
bustle
the
architect
took
to
dreaming
of
the
wealth
or
the
fame
or
the
honour
he
should
ask
as
his
due
when
the
stakes
were
won
employing
his
imagination
thus
he
one
day
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
which
by
this
time
was
completed
and
as
he
feasted
his
eyes
on
the
beautiful
landscape
spread
before
him
he
happened
to
turn
toward
the
town
of
treves
and
lo
a
shining
stream
was
threading
its
way
to
cologne
in
a
very
short
time
it
would
reach
the
latter
city
the
devil
had
won
with
a
laugh
of
defiance
the
architect
cast
himself
from
the
high
tower
and
was
instantly
killed
satan
in
the
form
of
a
black
hound
sprang
upon
him
but
was
too
late
to
find
him
alive
but
his
death
stopped
for
many
years
the
progress
of
the
cathedral
it
long
stood
at
the
same
stage
of
completion
as
when
the
brook
first
flowed
from
treves
to
cologne
the
of
cologne
in
one
of
the
grand
towers
of
cologne
cathedral
hangs
a
massive
bell
some
lb
in
weight
no
mellow
call
to
prayer
issues
from
its
brazen
throat
no
joyous
chimes
peal
forth
on
only
in
times
of
disaster
of
storm
and
stress
and
fire
it
flings
out
a
warning
in
tones
so
loud
and
clamorous
so
full
of
dire
threatenings
that
the
stoutest
hearts
quail
beneath
the
sound
because
its
awful
note
is
only
to
be
heard
in
time
of
terror
it
is
known
as
the
and
a
weird
tradition
relates
the
story
of
its
founding
and
the
reason
for
its
unearthly
sound
long
ago
when
was
looked
upon
as
an
art
of
the
highest
importance
and
especially
so
among
the
germans
the
civic
authorities
of
cologne
made
it
known
that
the
cathedral
was
in
need
of
a
new
bell
there
was
no
lack
of
aspirants
for
the
honour
of
casting
the
bell
and
more
than
one
exponent
of
the
art
imagined
his
handiwork
swinging
in
the
grand
tower
of
the
cathedral
a
lasting
and
melodious
monument
to
its
skill
among
those
whose
ambitious
souls
were
stirred
by
the
statement
of
the
city
fathers
was
one
a
named
wolf
a
man
of
evil
passions
and
overbearing
disposition
whose
heart
was
firmly
set
on
achieving
success
in
those
days
let
it
be
said
the
casting
of
a
bell
was
a
solemn
and
even
a
religious
performance
attended
by
elaborate
ceremonies
and
benedictions
on
the
day
which
wolf
had
appointed
for
the
operation
it
seemed
as
though
the
entire
populace
had
turned
out
to
witness
the
spectacle
wolf
having
prepared
the
mould
made
ready
to
pour
into
it
the
molten
metal
the
silence
was
almost
oppressive
and
on
it
fell
distinctly
the
solemn
words
of
the
as
in
name
he
released
the
metal
the
bright
stream
gushed
into
the
mould
and
a
cheer
broke
from
the
waiting
crowd
who
indeed
could
scarce
be
restrained
till
the
bell
had
cooled
such
was
their
curiosity
to
see
the
result
at
last
the
earthy
mould
was
removed
they
surged
round
eagerly
and
lo
from
crown
to
rim
of
the
mighty
bell
stretched
a
gaping
crack
expressions
of
disappointment
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
people
and
to
wolf
himself
the
failure
was
indeed
galling
but
his
ambitious
spirit
was
not
yet
completely
crushed
am
not
beaten
yet
he
said
boastfully
shall
make
another
and
success
shall
yet
be
another
mould
was
made
once
more
the
people
came
forth
to
see
the
casting
of
the
bell
once
more
the
solemn
invocation
of
name
fell
on
awed
ears
the
glowing
metal
filled
the
mould
cooled
and
was
withdrawn
from
its
earthy
prison
once
more
cries
of
disappointment
were
heard
from
the
crowd
again
the
massive
bell
was
completely
riven
wolf
was
beside
himself
his
eyes
glowed
with
fury
and
he
thrust
aside
the
consolations
of
his
friends
god
will
not
aid
me
he
said
fiercely
the
devil
will
the
crowd
shrank
back
from
the
impious
words
nevertheless
on
the
third
occasion
they
attended
in
even
greater
numbers
than
before
again
was
all
made
ready
for
the
casting
of
the
huge
bell
the
mould
was
fashioned
as
carefully
as
on
the
previous
occasions
the
metal
was
heated
in
the
great
furnace
and
wolf
pale
and
sullen
stood
ready
to
release
it
but
when
he
spoke
a
murmur
of
astonishment
of
horror
ran
through
the
crowd
for
the
familiar
words
the
name
of
god
he
had
substituted
the
name
of
the
devil
with
fascinated
eyes
the
people
watched
the
bright
rushing
metal
and
later
the
removal
of
the
mould
and
behold
the
bell
was
flawless
perfect
in
shape
and
form
and
beautiful
to
look
upon
wolf
having
achieved
the
summit
of
his
ambition
cared
little
for
the
means
by
which
he
had
ascended
from
among
a
host
of
competitors
he
was
chosen
as
the
most
successful
his
bell
was
to
hang
in
the
belfry
of
cologne
cathedral
for
the
envy
of
other
and
the
admiration
of
future
generations
the
bell
was
borne
in
triumph
through
the
streets
and
fixed
high
in
the
tower
wolf
requested
that
he
might
be
the
first
to
try
its
tone
and
his
request
was
granted
he
ascended
into
the
tower
and
took
the
rope
in
his
hands
the
mighty
bell
swung
forth
but
ah
what
a
sound
was
that
the
people
pressed
their
hands
over
their
ears
and
shuddered
those
in
the
streets
hurried
to
their
homes
all
were
filled
with
deadly
fear
as
the
diabolical
bell
flung
its
awful
tones
over
the
startled
city
this
then
was
the
result
of
invocation
of
the
devil
wolf
himself
high
in
the
cathedral
tower
was
overcome
with
the
brazen
horror
of
the
sound
and
driven
mad
with
remorse
and
terror
flung
himself
from
the
tower
and
fell
a
crushed
and
shapeless
mass
on
the
ground
below
henceforth
the
bell
was
used
only
to
convey
warning
in
times
of
danger
to
carry
a
message
of
terror
far
and
wide
across
the
city
and
to
remind
the
wicked
at
all
times
of
the
danger
of
trafficking
with
the
evil
one
the
lion
in
cologne
was
constituted
an
imperial
free
city
having
as
its
nominal
prince
the
archbishop
of
the
see
but
possessing
the
right
to
govern
its
own
affairs
the
good
bishop
of
that
time
acquiesced
in
the
arrangement
but
his
successors
were
not
content
to
be
princes
in
name
only
and
strove
hard
to
obtain
a
real
influence
over
the
citizens
being
for
the
most
part
men
of
unscrupulous
disposition
they
did
not
hesitate
to
rouse
commonalty
and
aristocracy
against
each
other
hoping
to
step
in
and
reap
the
benefits
of
such
internecine
warfare
as
might
ensue
and
indeed
the
continual
strife
was
not
conducive
to
the
prosperity
of
the
burghers
but
rather
tended
to
sap
their
independence
and
one
by
one
their
civil
liberties
were
surrendered
thus
the
scheming
archbishops
increased
their
power
and
influence
in
the
city
of
cologne
there
came
a
time
however
in
the
civic
history
when
the
limit
was
overstepped
in
the
thirteenth
century
archbishop
engelbert
more
daring
and
ambitious
than
any
of
his
predecessors
demanded
that
the
municipal
treasure
should
be
given
up
to
him
not
content
with
taking
away
the
privileges
of
the
burghers
he
wished
to
lay
his
hands
on
the
public
purse
as
well
this
was
indeed
the
last
straw
and
the
sluggish
blood
of
the
burghers
was
at
length
roused
to
revolt
at
this
time
the
burgomaster
of
cologne
hermann
grein
by
name
was
an
honest
and
diplomatic
citizen
who
had
seen
with
dismay
the
ancient
liberties
of
his
beloved
city
destroyed
by
the
cunning
of
the
archbishop
the
bold
attempt
at
further
encroachments
gave
him
the
opportunity
he
sought
and
with
the
skill
of
a
born
leader
hermann
grein
united
nobles
and
commons
in
the
determination
to
resist
their
mutual
enemy
feuds
were
for
the
time
being
forgotten
and
with
a
gallant
effort
the
galling
yoke
of
the
was
thrown
off
and
the
people
of
cologne
were
once
more
free
grein
performed
his
civic
duties
so
firmly
albeit
so
smoothly
and
gently
that
he
won
the
love
and
respect
of
all
sections
of
the
populace
old
and
young
hailed
him
in
their
hearts
as
the
deliverer
of
their
city
from
ecclesiastical
tyranny
only
engelbert
hated
him
with
a
deadly
hatred
and
swore
to
be
revenged
nor
was
his
resolve
weakened
when
a
later
attempt
to
subdue
the
city
was
frustrated
by
the
foresight
of
grein
it
became
obvious
to
the
archbishop
that
force
was
unavailing
for
the
majority
of
all
classes
were
on
the
side
of
liberty
and
were
likely
to
remain
so
while
hermann
grein
was
at
their
head
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
accomplish
by
means
of
strategy
the
death
of
the
good
old
man
now
there
were
in
the
monastery
close
by
cologne
two
canons
who
shared
hatred
of
grein
and
who
were
only
too
willing
to
share
in
his
revenge
and
the
plan
was
indeed
a
cunning
one
belonging
to
a
small
collection
of
animals
attached
to
the
monastery
was
a
fierce
lion
which
had
more
than
once
proved
a
convenient
mode
of
removing
the
enemies
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
burgomaster
should
be
asked
to
meet
the
archbishop
there
the
latter
sent
a
suave
message
to
his
enemy
saying
that
he
desired
to
treat
with
him
on
matters
connected
with
the
civic
privileges
which
he
was
disposed
to
restore
to
the
city
with
a
few
small
exceptions
this
being
the
case
would
the
burgomaster
consent
to
dine
with
him
at
the
monastery
on
a
certain
date
the
burgomaster
consented
heartily
for
he
was
a
man
to
whom
treachery
was
entirely
foreign
and
therefore
not
prone
to
suspect
that
vice
in
others
nevertheless
he
took
the
simple
precautions
of
arming
himself
and
making
his
destination
known
to
his
friends
before
he
set
out
when
he
arrived
at
the
monastery
resplendent
in
the
rich
garments
countenanced
by
the
fashion
of
the
time
he
was
told
that
the
archbishop
was
in
the
garden
you
walk
in
our
humble
garden
with
his
highness
the
canons
asked
the
burgomaster
and
he
a
lover
of
nature
bade
them
lead
the
way
the
garden
was
truly
a
lovely
spot
gay
with
all
manner
of
flowers
and
fruit
but
grein
looked
in
vain
for
his
host
highness
said
the
wily
canons
in
the
private
garden
where
only
the
heads
of
the
church
and
their
most
honoured
guests
are
admitted
ah
here
we
are
enter
noble
burgomaster
we
may
go
no
with
that
they
stopped
before
a
strong
door
opened
it
and
thrust
the
old
man
inside
in
a
moment
the
heavy
door
had
swung
to
with
a
crash
and
grein
found
himself
in
a
narrow
paved
court
with
high
unscalable
walls
on
every
side
and
from
a
dark
corner
there
bounded
forth
to
meet
him
a
huge
lion
with
a
pious
prayer
for
help
the
burgomaster
drew
his
sword
wrapped
his
rich
spanish
mantle
round
his
left
arm
and
prepared
to
defend
himself
against
his
adversary
with
a
roar
the
lion
was
upon
him
but
with
wonderful
agility
the
old
man
leapt
to
one
side
again
the
great
beast
sprang
endeavouring
to
get
the
head
between
its
jaws
again
and
again
grein
thrust
valiantly
and
in
one
of
these
efforts
his
weapon
reached
the
heart
and
it
rolled
over
dead
weak
and
exhausted
from
loss
of
blood
the
burgomaster
lost
consciousness
ere
long
he
was
roused
from
his
swoon
by
the
tones
of
the
and
the
sound
of
a
multitude
of
voices
a
moment
later
he
recalled
his
terrible
struggle
with
the
lion
and
uttered
a
devout
thanksgiving
for
his
escape
from
death
meanwhile
the
people
growing
anxious
at
his
prolonged
absence
and
fearing
that
some
ill
had
befallen
him
had
hastened
to
the
monastery
the
two
canons
seeing
the
approaching
crowd
ran
out
to
meet
them
wringing
their
hands
and
exclaiming
that
the
burgomaster
had
strayed
into
the
den
and
there
met
his
death
the
angry
crowd
in
nowise
deceived
by
their
pretences
demanded
to
be
shown
the
den
arrived
there
they
broke
down
the
door
and
to
their
great
joy
found
grein
alive
though
wounded
and
much
shaken
they
bore
him
triumphantly
through
the
town
first
crowning
his
hastily
improvised
litter
with
flowers
and
laurels
as
for
the
monks
their
priestly
garb
could
not
protect
their
persons
from
the
wrath
of
the
mob
and
they
were
hanged
at
the
gate
of
the
monastery
which
thereafter
became
known
as
the
the
white
horses
the
year
was
a
memorable
one
throughout
germany
for
the
great
plague
raged
with
fearful
violence
leaving
blanks
in
many
families
hitherto
unvisited
by
death
among
the
victims
was
richmodis
the
beloved
wife
of
sir
aducht
of
cologne
who
deeply
mourned
her
loss
the
lady
was
buried
with
a
valuable
her
finger
this
excited
the
cupidity
of
the
sextons
who
resolved
to
obtain
possession
of
it
opened
the
tomb
in
the
night
and
wrenched
off
the
their
difficulties
however
were
not
at
an
end
for
when
they
tried
to
possess
themselves
of
the
ring
it
resolutely
adhered
to
the
finger
of
the
corpse
suddenly
to
their
horror
the
dead
body
gently
raised
itself
with
a
deep
sigh
as
though
the
soul
of
richmodis
regarded
this
symbol
of
wifely
duty
as
sacred
and
would
resist
the
efforts
of
the
thieves
to
take
it
from
her
the
dark
and
hollow
eyes
opened
and
met
those
of
the
desecrators
and
a
threatening
light
seemed
to
come
from
them
at
this
ghastly
sight
the
terrified
sextons
fled
in
abject
panic
richmodis
recovered
by
degrees
and
gradually
realizing
where
she
was
she
concluded
that
she
must
have
been
buried
while
alive
in
her
terror
she
cried
aloud
for
help
but
nobody
could
hear
her
it
was
the
lone
hour
of
midnight
when
all
nature
reposes
summoning
strength
she
resolved
to
make
an
effort
to
go
to
the
husband
who
had
placed
the
ring
upon
her
finger
and
getting
out
of
the
coffin
she
made
her
way
shivering
toward
their
home
the
wind
moaned
dismally
through
the
trees
and
their
foliage
cast
dark
spectral
shadows
that
swayed
fitfully
to
and
fro
in
the
weird
light
of
the
waning
moon
as
richmodis
staggered
along
feebly
absorbed
in
the
melancholy
thoughts
which
her
terrible
experience
suggested
not
a
sound
save
the
soughing
of
the
wind
was
heard
within
peaceful
acre
for
over
the
wrecks
of
time
silence
lay
motionless
in
the
arms
of
death
the
pale
rays
illumined
the
buildings
when
richmodis
arrived
at
her
house
in
the
new
market
she
knocked
repeatedly
but
at
first
received
no
response
to
her
summons
after
a
time
sir
aducht
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
annoyed
at
the
disturbance
at
such
an
hour
he
was
about
to
speak
angrily
when
the
apparition
looked
up
at
him
with
a
tender
regard
of
love
and
asked
him
to
descend
quickly
and
open
the
door
to
receive
his
wife
nearly
exhausted
by
cold
and
terror
the
bereaved
husband
refused
to
believe
that
the
wife
whom
he
had
just
buried
had
come
back
to
him
and
he
declared
that
he
would
as
soon
expect
his
horses
to
climb
upstairs
as
believe
that
his
dead
wife
could
return
to
him
alive
he
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
when
the
trampling
of
his
two
horses
on
the
staircase
was
distinctly
heard
a
moment
or
two
later
he
looked
from
the
casement
and
saw
the
steeds
at
an
upper
window
and
he
could
doubt
no
longer
rushing
to
the
door
he
received
his
shivering
wife
into
his
arms
the
ring
she
still
wore
would
have
removed
all
doubts
had
there
been
room
for
such
husband
and
wife
spent
many
years
together
in
domestic
happiness
and
in
memory
of
that
remarkable
night
sir
aducht
fixed
wooden
effigies
of
two
heads
to
the
outside
of
the
window
where
they
still
remain
for
all
to
see
the
magic
banquet
another
interesting
tale
of
cologne
deals
with
the
famous
magician
and
alchemist
albertus
magnus
who
at
one
time
dwelt
in
the
convent
of
the
dominicans
not
far
from
that
city
it
is
recorded
that
on
one
occasion
in
the
depth
of
winter
albertus
invited
william
of
holland
to
a
feast
which
was
to
be
held
in
the
convent
garden
the
recipients
of
the
curious
invitation
william
and
his
courtiers
were
naturally
much
amazed
at
the
terms
thereof
but
decided
not
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
attending
such
a
novel
banquet
in
due
course
they
arrived
at
the
monastery
where
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
feast
the
tables
being
laid
amid
the
snow
the
guests
had
fortified
themselves
against
the
severe
weather
by
wearing
their
warmest
clothing
and
furs
no
sooner
had
they
taken
their
seats
however
than
albertus
exercising
the
magic
powers
he
possessed
turned
the
wintry
garden
into
a
scene
of
summer
bloom
and
loveliness
the
heavy
furs
were
laid
aside
and
the
guests
were
glad
to
seek
the
shade
of
the
spreading
foliage
iced
drinks
were
brought
to
allay
their
thirst
and
a
sumptuous
banquet
was
provided
by
their
hosts
thus
the
hours
passed
unheeded
till
the
ave
maria
was
rung
by
the
immediately
the
spell
was
broken
and
once
more
snow
and
ice
dominated
the
scene
the
courtiers
who
had
rid
themselves
of
as
much
of
their
clothing
as
court
etiquette
would
permit
shivered
in
the
bitter
blast
and
looked
the
very
picture
of
blank
much
so
that
william
forgot
his
own
suffering
and
laughed
heartily
at
the
discomfiture
of
his
train
this
story
has
a
quaint
sequel
to
show
his
approval
of
the
magic
feat
william
granted
to
the
convent
a
piece
of
land
of
considerable
extent
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cologne
and
sent
some
of
his
courtiers
to
present
the
deed
of
gift
the
hospitable
prior
anxious
that
the
members
of
the
deputation
should
be
suitably
entertained
drew
from
the
cellars
of
the
monastery
some
choice
rhenish
which
so
pleased
the
palates
of
the
courtiers
that
they
drank
and
drank
and
did
not
seem
to
know
when
to
stop
at
length
the
prior
beholding
with
dismay
the
disappearance
of
his
finest
vintage
privately
begged
the
magician
to
put
a
stop
to
this
drain
on
the
resources
of
his
cellar
albertus
consented
and
once
more
the
were
replenished
imagine
the
horror
of
the
courtiers
when
each
beheld
ghastly
flames
issuing
from
his
cup
in
their
dismay
they
seized
hold
of
one
another
and
would
not
let
go
only
when
the
phenomenon
had
disappeared
did
they
discover
that
each
held
his
neighbour
by
the
nose
and
such
was
their
chagrin
at
being
seen
in
this
unconventional
pose
that
they
quitted
the
monastery
without
a
word
and
never
entered
it
again
truenfels
at
a
place
called
truenfels
near
the
oelberg
and
not
very
far
from
cologne
there
lived
at
one
time
in
the
middle
ages
a
knight
named
sir
balther
his
schloss
was
known
as
the
mount
and
there
dwelt
with
him
here
his
only
daughter
liba
whose
great
beauty
had
won
for
her
a
vast
entourage
of
suitors
each
was
equally
importunate
but
only
one
was
in
any
way
favoured
sir
sibert
ulenthal
and
at
the
time
the
story
opens
this
sir
sibert
had
lately
become
affianced
to
sir
daughter
now
sir
balther
felt
an
ardent
aversion
to
one
of
his
neighbours
the
bishop
of
cologne
and
his
hatred
of
this
prelate
was
shared
abundantly
by
various
other
knights
and
nobles
of
the
district
one
evening
it
chanced
a
body
of
these
were
gathered
together
at
the
mount
and
after
rhenish
had
circulated
freely
among
them
and
loosened
their
tongues
one
and
all
began
to
vent
wrath
on
the
churchman
talking
volubly
of
his
avarice
and
misdeeds
in
general
but
why
cried
one
of
them
should
they
be
content
with
so
tame
a
thing
as
scurrilous
speech
were
not
men
of
the
sword
more
doughty
than
men
of
the
robe
he
added
and
thereupon
a
wild
shout
was
raised
by
the
revellers
and
they
swore
that
they
would
sally
forth
instantly
and
slay
him
whom
they
all
loathed
so
passionately
it
happened
that
even
as
they
set
out
the
bishop
was
returning
from
a
visit
to
a
remote
part
of
his
diocese
and
being
wholly
unprepared
to
cope
with
a
gang
of
desperadoes
like
these
he
fell
an
easy
prey
to
their
attack
but
the
church
in
medieval
days
did
not
take
acts
of
this
sort
passively
and
the
matter
being
investigated
and
it
transpiring
that
the
mount
had
been
the
rallying
ground
of
the
murderers
a
band
of
troops
was
sent
to
raze
sir
castle
and
slay
its
inmates
the
news
meanwhile
reached
the
fair
fiancé
sir
sibert
and
knowing
well
that
in
the
event
of
the
mount
being
stormed
by
the
avenging
party
death
or
an
equally
terrible
fate
might
befall
his
betrothed
the
lover
felt
sad
indeed
he
hastened
to
the
king
and
implored
his
intervention
on
this
being
refused
he
proposed
that
he
himself
should
join
the
besiegers
at
the
same
time
carrying
with
him
a
royal
pardon
for
liba
for
what
concern
had
she
with
her
crimes
his
majesty
was
persuaded
to
give
the
requisite
document
to
sir
sibert
who
then
hied
him
at
full
speed
to
the
mount
there
to
find
the
siege
going
forward
the
walls
of
the
castle
were
strong
and
as
yet
the
inmates
were
showing
a
good
fight
but
as
day
after
day
went
past
their
strength
and
resources
began
to
wane
and
anon
it
seemed
as
though
they
could
not
possibly
hold
out
longer
accordingly
the
soldiers
redoubled
their
efforts
to
effect
a
breach
which
being
compassed
ultimately
they
rushed
upon
the
little
garrison
and
now
picture
the
consternation
of
liba
when
she
found
that
her
own
lover
was
among
the
assailants
of
her
home
amid
the
din
of
battle
he
called
to
her
loudly
once
and
again
telling
her
that
he
carried
a
royal
pardon
for
her
and
that
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
forsake
her
father
and
follow
her
betrothed
instead
but
in
the
din
of
battle
she
did
not
hear
or
mistook
the
tenor
of
his
words
and
ere
he
could
make
himself
understood
the
garrison
of
the
castle
began
to
yield
and
a
moment
later
the
building
was
in
flames
many
of
the
besieged
were
burnt
to
death
but
liba
and
her
father
hastened
to
a
little
chamber
at
the
base
of
the
schloss
and
thence
they
won
to
a
subterranean
passage
which
was
known
only
to
themselves
and
which
led
to
a
distant
place
in
the
surrounding
wilds
gazing
at
the
blackened
ruins
sir
sibert
felt
as
though
henceforth
the
world
held
for
him
no
joy
whatsoever
he
refused
to
be
comforted
so
convinced
was
he
that
liba
had
perished
in
the
terrible
fray
but
one
stormy
evening
wandering
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
he
perceived
two
figures
who
seemed
to
him
familiar
true
both
were
haggard
and
tattered
but
as
he
drew
near
to
them
the
pulses
quickened
of
a
sudden
for
he
knew
that
his
beloved
stood
before
him
would
she
listen
to
him
now
he
wondered
or
would
she
still
imagine
him
perfidious
and
scorn
the
aid
which
he
offered
while
he
was
debating
with
himself
the
storm
increased
and
the
great
peals
of
thunder
sounding
overhead
made
the
heart
beat
faster
he
drew
the
document
from
within
his
doublet
and
approached
the
pair
of
my
the
words
faltered
to
sir
lips
but
he
got
no
further
a
great
flash
of
lightning
descended
from
on
high
and
lo
sir
balther
and
liba
lay
stricken
in
death
the
lover
built
a
chapel
on
the
spot
where
his
betrothed
had
fallen
and
here
he
dwelt
till
the
end
of
his
days
it
would
seem
nevertheless
that
those
pious
exercises
wherewith
hermits
chiefly
occupy
themselves
were
not
his
only
occupation
for
long
after
the
chapel
itself
had
become
a
ruin
its
sight
was
marked
by
a
great
stone
which
bore
an
inscription
in
rude
single
word
doubtless
sir
sibert
had
hewn
this
epitaph
with
his
own
hands
rolandseck
and
nonnenwerth
the
castle
of
rolandseck
stands
opposite
drachenfels
below
them
on
an
island
in
the
rhine
is
the
convent
of
nonnenwerth
roland
nephew
whose
fame
had
spread
throughout
the
world
while
riding
one
day
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
sought
the
hospitality
of
the
lord
of
drachenfels
honoured
at
receiving
such
a
distinguished
guest
the
lord
of
the
castle
hastened
to
welcome
him
the
ladies
gave
the
brave
knight
as
cordial
a
reception
as
their
lord
whose
charming
daughter
seemed
deeply
impressed
by
the
knightly
deportment
admiring
glances
lingered
lovingly
on
the
fair
maid
who
blushed
in
sweet
confusion
and
whose
tender
looks
alone
betrayed
the
presence
of
cupid
who
but
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
manifest
his
power
at
his
bidding
roland
put
off
his
armour
but
even
in
his
own
room
a
vision
of
maidenly
beauty
haunted
him
thereby
showing
how
subtly
the
young
charms
had
wound
themselves
around
the
heart
roland
remained
for
some
time
with
the
lord
of
drachenfels
fascinated
more
and
more
by
the
grace
and
beauty
of
his
winsome
daughter
besides
being
beautiful
she
was
a
clever
needlewoman
and
he
admired
the
dexterity
with
which
she
embroidered
ornamental
designs
on
damask
only
when
asked
by
her
to
relate
some
deeds
of
daring
or
describe
the
wondrous
countries
through
which
he
had
travelled
would
roland
become
eloquent
then
he
grew
enthusiastic
his
cheeks
glowed
his
eyes
sparkled
and
the
enamoured
maid
would
regard
her
hero
with
admiration
she
evinced
a
lively
interest
in
his
exploits
their
eyes
would
meet
then
with
a
throbbing
breast
she
would
resume
her
work
by
his
side
from
this
blissful
dream
roland
was
summoned
to
the
wars
again
the
brave
soldier
prepared
to
depart
but
he
realized
the
joys
he
must
renounce
once
more
he
visited
the
favourite
haunts
where
they
had
spent
such
happy
moments
the
sound
of
someone
weeping
aroused
him
from
his
reverie
and
he
beheld
his
seated
in
an
arbour
sobbing
bitterly
each
knew
the
grief
which
separation
must
bring
roland
consoled
the
maiden
by
promising
to
return
soon
nevermore
to
part
only
her
tears
betrayed
how
deeply
the
arrow
of
the
winged
god
had
sunk
into
her
heart
a
few
days
later
they
were
betrothed
after
which
roland
departed
in
quest
of
glory
many
victories
were
gained
by
him
and
soon
the
enemy
was
vanquished
rejoicings
were
held
to
celebrate
the
event
but
at
drachenfels
castle
sad
faces
and
tearful
eyes
told
a
tale
of
sorrow
for
it
had
been
announced
that
roland
was
dead
the
rosy
cheeks
grew
pale
with
grief
nothing
could
console
her
for
was
not
her
hero
departed
from
her
for
ever
in
the
intensity
of
her
anguish
she
sought
relief
in
prayer
and
found
a
refuge
in
religion
she
entered
the
convent
at
nonnenwerth
resolved
to
dedicate
her
life
to
heaven
since
the
joys
of
earth
had
fled
her
afflicted
parents
reluctantly
acquiesced
in
this
proposal
daily
they
beheld
their
daughter
waving
her
hand
to
them
as
she
entered
the
chapel
suddenly
there
appeared
before
the
gates
of
drachenfels
a
troop
of
cavaliers
whose
armour
shone
brilliantly
in
the
sun
roland
had
returned
home
from
the
wars
crowned
with
glory
to
claim
his
bride
but
when
he
heard
that
she
had
taken
the
veil
his
buoyant
spirits
sank
the
lord
of
drachenfels
told
him
that
they
had
believed
the
report
of
his
death
to
be
true
a
cry
of
despair
broke
from
the
hero
of
a
hundred
fights
he
crossed
the
rhine
to
the
castle
of
rolandseck
where
he
remained
for
many
weeks
abandoned
to
grief
frequently
he
looked
toward
the
convent
which
held
his
beloved
one
evening
he
heard
the
bells
tolling
and
saw
a
funeral
procession
of
nuns
carrying
a
coffin
to
the
chapel
his
page
told
him
that
his
love
was
dead
but
roland
had
already
divined
that
she
who
had
mourned
his
supposed
death
had
died
through
grief
for
him
who
was
still
alive
to
mourn
her
death
time
rolled
on
and
roland
went
again
to
the
wars
and
achieved
greater
conquests
but
at
length
he
fell
fighting
against
the
moors
at
roncevaux
dying
on
the
battlefield
as
he
had
wished
his
valorous
deeds
and
his
glorious
death
were
sung
by
minstrels
throughout
all
christendom
and
his
fame
will
never
die
legends
of
was
the
ancient
seat
of
the
empire
of
charlemagne
and
many
legends
cluster
around
it
several
of
which
have
already
been
noticed
in
connexion
with
its
great
founder
the
following
legends
however
deal
with
the
town
itself
and
not
with
any
circumstance
connected
with
the
mighty
karl
the
hunchbacked
musician
in
dwelt
two
hunchbacked
musicians
friedel
was
a
lively
fellow
with
a
pleasant
face
and
an
engaging
manner
heinz
had
red
hair
green
eyes
and
a
malevolent
expression
friedel
was
a
better
player
than
heinz
that
combined
with
his
agreeable
looks
made
him
a
general
favourite
friedel
loved
agathe
the
daughter
of
a
rich
the
prospects
were
not
encouraging
for
father
sought
a
from
higher
circles
the
poor
plight
was
rendered
desperate
by
the
compelling
his
daughter
to
accept
a
rich
but
dissipated
young
man
when
the
hunchback
approached
the
merchant
to
declare
his
feelings
toward
the
maiden
he
was
met
with
derision
and
insult
full
of
bitterness
he
wandered
about
till
midnight
found
him
in
the
where
the
sabbath
was
about
to
take
place
a
weird
light
was
cast
over
everything
and
a
crowd
of
female
figures
quickly
gathered
a
lady
who
seemed
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
party
offered
the
hunchback
refreshment
and
others
handed
him
a
violin
desiring
him
to
play
for
them
friedel
played
and
the
witches
danced
faster
and
faster
for
the
violin
was
bewitched
at
last
the
violinist
fell
exhausted
and
the
dancing
ceased
the
lady
now
commanded
him
to
kneel
and
receive
the
thanks
of
the
company
for
his
beautiful
playing
then
she
muttered
strange
words
over
the
kneeling
hunchback
when
friedel
arose
his
hump
was
gone
just
then
the
clock
struck
one
everything
vanished
and
the
musician
found
himself
alone
in
the
next
morning
his
showed
him
that
he
had
not
been
dreaming
and
in
his
pocket
he
found
a
large
sum
of
money
which
made
him
the
equal
of
the
richest
in
the
town
overjoyed
at
the
transformation
he
lost
no
time
in
seeking
house
the
sight
of
his
gold
turned
the
scale
in
his
favour
and
the
consented
to
his
suit
now
heinz
was
inflamed
with
jealousy
and
tried
to
calumniate
his
companion
by
spreading
evil
stories
strange
adventure
leaked
abroad
and
heinz
determined
to
try
his
fortune
likewise
so
at
the
next
he
hastened
to
the
where
at
the
outset
everything
happened
in
exactly
the
same
manner
heinz
was
requested
to
play
but
his
avaricious
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
golden
vessels
on
the
table
and
his
thoughts
were
with
the
large
reward
he
would
ask
consequently
his
playing
became
so
discordant
that
the
indignant
dancers
made
him
cease
kneeling
down
to
receive
his
reward
he
demanded
the
valuable
whereupon
with
scornful
and
mocking
words
the
lady
who
was
the
leader
of
the
band
fixed
on
his
breast
the
hump
she
had
taken
from
friedel
immediately
the
clock
struck
one
and
all
disappeared
the
poor
rage
was
boundless
for
he
found
himself
now
saddled
with
two
humps
he
became
an
object
of
ridicule
to
the
townsfolk
but
friedel
pitied
him
and
maintained
him
ever
after
the
legend
of
the
cathedral
of
in
former
times
the
zealous
and
devout
inhabitants
of
determined
to
build
a
cathedral
for
six
months
the
clang
of
the
hammer
and
axe
resounded
with
wonderful
activity
but
alas
the
money
which
had
been
supplied
by
pious
christians
for
this
holy
work
became
exhausted
the
wages
of
the
masons
were
perforce
suspended
and
with
them
their
desire
to
hew
and
hammer
for
after
all
men
must
have
money
wherewith
to
feed
their
families
thus
the
cathedral
stood
half
finished
resembling
a
falling
ruin
moss
grass
and
wild
parsley
flourished
in
the
cracks
of
the
walls
already
discovered
convenient
places
for
their
nests
and
amorous
sparrows
hopped
lovingly
about
where
holy
priests
should
have
been
teaching
lessons
of
chastity
the
builders
were
confounded
they
endeavoured
to
borrow
here
and
there
but
no
rich
man
could
be
induced
to
advance
the
large
sum
required
the
collections
from
house
to
house
produced
little
so
that
instead
of
the
golden
coins
nothing
was
found
in
the
boxes
but
copper
when
the
magistracy
received
this
report
they
were
out
of
humour
and
looked
with
desponding
countenances
toward
the
cathedral
walls
as
fathers
look
upon
the
remains
of
favourite
children
at
this
moment
a
stranger
of
commanding
figure
and
something
of
pride
in
his
voice
and
bearing
entered
the
council
chamber
and
exclaimed
dieu
it
is
said
that
you
are
out
of
spirits
hem
if
nothing
but
money
is
wanting
you
may
console
yourselves
gentlemen
i
possess
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
both
can
and
will
most
willingly
supply
you
with
a
ton
of
the
astounded
magistrates
sat
like
a
row
of
pillars
measuring
the
stranger
from
head
to
foot
the
burgomaster
first
found
his
tongue
are
you
noble
lord
said
he
thus
entirely
unknown
speak
of
tons
of
gold
as
though
they
were
sacks
of
beans
tell
us
your
name
your
rank
in
this
world
and
whether
you
are
sent
from
the
regions
above
to
assist
have
not
the
honour
to
reside
there
replied
the
stranger
between
ourselves
i
beg
most
particularly
to
be
no
longer
troubled
with
questions
concerning
who
and
what
i
am
suffice
it
to
say
i
have
gold
plentiful
as
summer
hay
then
drawing
forth
a
leathern
pouch
he
proceeded
little
purse
contains
the
tenth
of
what
give
the
rest
shall
soon
be
forthcoming
now
listen
my
masters
continued
he
clinking
the
coin
this
trumpery
is
and
shall
remain
yours
if
you
promise
to
give
me
the
first
little
soul
that
enters
the
door
of
the
new
temple
when
it
is
the
astonished
magistrates
sprang
from
their
seats
as
if
they
had
been
shot
up
by
an
earthquake
and
rushed
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
where
they
rolled
and
clung
to
each
other
like
lambs
frightened
at
flashes
of
lightning
only
one
of
the
party
had
not
entirely
lost
his
wits
and
he
collected
his
remaining
senses
and
drawing
his
head
out
of
the
heap
uttered
boldly
thou
wicked
spirit
but
the
stranger
who
was
no
less
a
person
than
master
urian
laughed
at
them
all
this
outcry
about
said
he
at
length
my
offence
so
heinous
that
you
are
all
become
like
children
it
is
i
that
may
suffer
from
this
business
not
you
with
my
hundreds
and
thousands
i
have
not
far
to
run
to
buy
a
score
of
souls
of
you
i
ask
but
one
in
exchange
for
all
my
money
what
are
you
picking
at
straws
for
one
may
plainly
see
you
are
a
mere
set
of
humbugs
for
the
good
of
the
commonwealth
which
name
is
often
borrowed
for
all
sorts
of
purposes
many
a
prince
would
instantly
conduct
a
whole
army
to
be
butchered
and
you
refuse
one
single
man
for
that
purpose
fie
i
am
ashamed
o
overwise
counsellors
to
hear
you
reason
thus
absurdly
and
what
do
you
think
to
deprive
yourselves
of
the
kernel
of
your
people
by
granting
my
wish
oh
no
there
your
wisdom
is
quite
at
fault
for
depend
on
it
hypocrites
are
always
the
earliest
church
by
degrees
as
the
cunning
fiend
thus
spoke
the
magistrates
took
courage
and
whispered
in
each
ears
is
the
use
of
our
resisting
the
grim
lion
will
only
show
his
teeth
once
if
we
assent
we
shall
infallibly
be
packed
off
ourselves
it
is
better
therefore
to
quiet
him
scarcely
had
they
given
effect
to
this
new
disposition
and
concluded
the
bargain
when
a
swarm
of
purses
flew
into
the
room
through
doors
and
windows
urian
now
took
leave
but
he
stopped
at
the
door
and
called
out
with
a
grim
leer

piously
expended
in
finishing
the
cathedral
but
nevertheless
when
the
building
was
completed
splendid
though
it
was
the
whole
town
was
filled
with
fear
and
alarm
at
the
sight
of
it
the
fact
was
that
although
the
magistrates
had
promised
by
bond
and
oath
not
to
trust
the
secret
to
anybody
one
had
prated
to
his
wife
and
she
had
made
it
a
tale
so
that
one
and
all
declared
they
would
never

walls

terrified

so
long

this
morning
caught
alive
this
will
be
a
punishment
for
the
destroyer

our
flocks

him
be

to
the
devil

the
fiery
gulf

must
swallow
it
you
promised

certainly
a
soul
but
whose

the
plan
was
plausible
and
the
magistrates
determined
to
put
the
cunning
trick
into
execution
the
day
of
consecration
arrived
orders
were
given
to
bring
the
wolf
to
the
principal
entrance
of
the
cathedral
and
just
as
the
bells
began
to
ring
the
of
the
cage
was
opened
and
the
savage
beast
darted
out
into
the
nave
of
the
empty
church

urian
from
his
beheld
this
with
the
utmost
fury
burning
with
choler
at
being
thus
deceived
he
raged
like
a
tempest
and
finally
rushed
forth
slamming
the
brass
gate
so
violently
after
him
that
the
ring
cracked
in
twain
this
fissure
commemorates
the
victory
over
the
devices
of
the
devil
and
is
still
exhibited
to
travellers
who
visit
the
cathedral
a
legend
of
bonn
the
city
of
bonn
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
those
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
being
the
birthplace
of
no
less
celebrated
a
composer
than
beethoven
it
naturally
attracts
a
goodly
number
of
pilgrims
every
year
these
coming
from
many
distant
lands
to
do
homage
at
the
shrine
of
genius
but
bonn
and
its
neighbourhood
have
older
associations
than
which
carry
the
mind
of
the
traveller
far
into
the
middle
hard
by
the
town
is
rolandseck
while
a
feature
of
the
district
is
the
siebengebirge
seven
mountains
a
fine
serried
range
of
peaks
which
present
a
very
imposing
appearance
when
viewed
from
any
of
the
heights
overlooking
bonn
itself
and
which
recall
a
justly
famous
legend
this
story
tells
that
in
the
thirteenth
century
there
lived
at
a
castle
in
the
heart
of
these
mountains
a
nobleman
called
wolfram
herzog
von
bergendorf
and
being
no
freebooter
like
most
of
the
other
german
barons
of
the
time
but
a
man
of
very
pious
disposition
he
was
moved
during
the
prime
of
his
life
to
forsake
his
home
and
join
a
body
of
crusaders
reaching
palestine
after
a
protracted
journey
these
remained
there
for
a
long
time
wolfram
fighting
gallantly
in
every
fray
and
making
his
name
a
terror
to
the
saracens
but
the
brave
crusader
was
wounded
eventually
and
now
he
set
out
for
germany
thirsting
all
the
way
for
a
sight
of
his
beloved
siebengebirge
and
dreaming
of
the
schloss
which
was
his
home
as
he
drew
nearer
to
it
he
pictured
the
welcome
which
his
fond
herzogin
would
give
him
but
scarcely
had
the
drawbridge
been
lowered
to
admit
him
to
his
castle
ere
a
fell
piece
of
news
was
imparted
to
him
in
short
it
transpired
that
his
wife
elise
had
been
unfaithful
to
him
during
his
absence
and
on
hearing
that
he
was
returning
had
fled
precipitately
with
her
infant
son
it
was
rumoured
that
she
had
found
refuge
in
a
convent
but
wolfram
was
quite
unable
to
ascertain
his
whereabouts
the
doors
of
all
nunneries
being
impassable
to
men
while
even
the
joy
of
revenge
was
denied
him
for
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
find
out
the
name
of
the
person
who
had
wronged
him
so
the
herzog
was
and
he
vowed
that
henceforth
he
would
live
a
solitary
life
within
his
castle
spending
his
time
in
prayer
and
seeing
only
his
own
retainers
for
many
years
this
vow
was
piously
observed
and
wolfram
never
stirred
abroad
in
course
of
time
however
he
began
to
chafe
at
the
restraint
feeling
it
the
more
acutely
because
he
was
an
old
soldier
and
had
known
the
excitement
of
warfare
and
so
it
came
about
that
he
revoked
his
decision
and
began
to
travel
about
the
country
as
of
old
it
seemed
also
to
some
of
his
henchmen
that
he
was
gradually
becoming
more
like
his
former
self
and
they
sometimes
said
among
themselves
that
he
would
marry
again
and
had
quite
forgotten
his
wrongs
but
the
very
reverse
was
the
truth
and
if
wolfram
was
growing
more
cheerful
it
was
because
new
hopes
of
retribution
were
springing
up
in
his
heart
the
chance
would
come
he
often
told
himself
surely
the
fates
would
one
day
confront
him
with
his
lover
and
one
day
as
he
rode
through
the
village
of
gudesburg
these
revengeful
thoughts
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
they
engrossed
him
wholly
and
he
took
little
heed
of
the
but
an
unexpected
stumble
on
the
part
of
his
horse
caused
him
to
look
up
and
of
a
sudden
his
eyes
blazed
like
live
coals
here
walking
only
a
few
yards
away
from
him
was
a
youth
who
bore
an
unmistakable
resemblance
to
the
unfaithful
elise
and
dismounting
instantly
the
herzog
strode
up
to
the
stranger
hailed
him
loudly
and
proceeded
to
question
him
concerning
his
identity
the
youth
was
surprised
at
the
anger
expressed
on
the
elder
countenance
and
being
overawed
he
answered
all
questions
without
hesitation
unfolding
the
little
he
knew
about
his
parentage
nor
had
instincts
deceived
him
the
tale
he
heard
confirmed
his
suspicions
and
drawing
his
sword
he
slew
the
youth
in
cold
blood
denying
him
even
a
moment
in
which
to
repeat
a
paternoster
a
rude
iron
cross
still
standing
by
the
road
at
gudesburg
is
said
to
mark
the
place
where
the
and
unoffending
young
man
met
his
doom
possibly
this
cross
was
erected
by
wolfram
himself
because
he
experienced
remorse
and
felt
that
he
had
been
unduly
hasty
in
taking
life
but
be
that
as
it
may
the
story
concludes
by
asserting
that
the
herzog
once
more
vowed
that
he
would
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
solitude
and
prayer
and
that
henceforth
to
the
end
his
vow
remained
unbroken
the
this
is
a
picturesque
tale
of
the
consequences
of
wealth
attained
by
the
aid
of
the
supernatural
which
hangs
about
the
ancient
village
of
endenich
near
bonn
where
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
there
dwelt
a
certain
sheriff
and
his
son
konrad
who
was
a
locksmith
by
trade
they
were
poor
and
had
lost
everything
in
the
recent
wars
which
had
also
ruined
heribert
another
sheriff
who
with
his
daughter
the
beautiful
gretchen
eked
out
a
frugal
but
peaceful
existence
in
the
same
neighbourhood
the
two
young
people
fell
in
love
with
each
other
but
father
becoming
suddenly
and
mysteriously
very
rich
and
arrogant
withal
desired
a
wealthy
or
highly
placed
official
as
his
and
not
a
poor
lad
with
no
expectations
such
as
konrad
the
locksmith
the
lovers
were
therefore
compelled
to
meet
in
secret
and
it
was
on
one
of
these
occasions
that
heribert
surprising
them
together
attacked
konrad
and
felled
him
to
the
ground
in
his
rage
that
he
should
dare
to
approach
his
daughter
spurred
by
his
love
and
knowing
that
he
could
never
hope
to
win
gretchen
without
wealth
the
unhappy
youth
decided
to
barter
for
gold
the
only
possession
left
to
soul
now
there
lived
in
the
churchyard
a
lapp
wizard
who
made
such
bargains
so
in
the
dead
of
night
konrad
took
his
way
to
this
dreadful
and
unfrequented
spot
and
exhorted
the
sorcerer
to
come
forth
at
the
third
cry
a
terrible
apparition
appeared
and
demanded
to
know
his
wishes
to
which
the
terrified
konrad
could
only
reply
thereupon
the
sorcerer
led
the
way
deep
into
a
forest
and
pointing
mysteriously
to
a
certain
spot
disappeared
at
this
spot
konrad
found
a
chest
full
of
gold
and
silver
coins
and
returning
to
bonn
he
bought
a
house
the
splendour
of
which
surpassed
that
of
heribert
who
could
no
longer
refuse
his
daughter
to
so
wealthy
a
suitor
the
young
wife
tried
all
her
arts
to
solve
the
mystery
of
her
wealth
and
he
was
at
length
about
to
reveal
it
to
her
when
he
was
suddenly
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
here
he
was
put
to
torture
by
the
authorities
who
suspected
him
of
robbery
and
at
length
he
confessed
that
he
had
found
a
treasure
while
to
his
wife
he
confided
the
gruesome
details
all
of
which
were
overheard
by
his
jailers
he
was
released
but
almost
immediately
on
the
suspicion
that
he
had
killed
a
jew
named
abraham
who
had
amassed
great
sums
during
the
wars
as
a
spy
tortured
again
in
his
extremity
he
confessed
to
the
murder
and
named
heribert
as
his
accomplice
whereupon
both
men
were
sentenced
to
be
hanged
just
as
this
doom
was
about
to
be
carried
out
a
jew
who
had
arrived
from
a
far
country
hurriedly
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
it
was
abraham
who
had
returned
in
time
to
save
the
innocent
but
his
sin
did
not
pass
unpunished
for
konrad
died
childless
he
bequeathed
his
wealth
to
the
church
and
charities
in
expiation
of
his
sin
of
having
attained
wealth

the
aid
of
an
evil

the
mill
in
charge
of
the
youngest
child
a
boy
of
about
five
years
of
age
on
the
departure
of
the
family
for
church
hännchen
busied
herself
in
preparing
dinner
but
had
scarcely
commenced
her
task
ere
a
visitor
entered
the
kitchen
this
was
no
other
than
her
sweetheart
heinrich
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
some
time
indeed
he
had
earned
so
bad
a
reputation
as
a
loafer
and
an
idle
that
the
miller
as
much
on
account
as
on
his
own
had
forbidden
him
the
house
hännchen
however
received
her
lover
with
undisguised
pleasure
straightway
set
food
before
him
and
sat
down
beside
him
for
a
chat
judging
that
the
dinner
was
of
small
consequence
compared
with
her
heinrich
the
latter
ate
heartily
and
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
dropped
his
knife
as
though
by
accident
that
up
my
girl
said
he
hännchen
protested
but
obeyed
none
the
less
as
she
stooped
to
the
floor
heinrich
seized
her
by
the
neck
and
held
another
knife
to
her
throat
girl
show
me
where
your
master
keeps
his
money
he
growled
hoarsely
you
value
your
life
make
me
go
and
tell
you
gasped
hännchen
and
when
he
had
loosened
his
grip
on
her
throat
she
looked
at
him
calmly
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
heinrich
she
said
pleasantly
you
take
my
money
you
must
take
me
too
for
this
will
be
no
place
for
me
will
you
take
me
with
you
heinrich
the
hulking
fellow
was
taken
completely
off
his
guard
by
her
apparent
acquiescence
and
touched
by
her
desire
to
accompany
him
which
he
attributed
with
the
conceit
of
his
kind
to
his
own
personal
attractions
i
find
the
money
you
shall
come
with
me
hännchen
he
conceded
graciously
if
you
play
me
the
sentence
ended
with
an
expressive
motion
of
his
knife
well
then
said
the
maid
money
is
in
room
come
and
i
will
show
you
where
it
is
she
led
him
to
the
room
showed
him
the
massive
coffer
in
which
lay
her
wealth
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
iron
wherewith
to
prise
it
open
will
go
to
my
own
room
she
said
get
my
little
savings
and
then
we
shall
be
ready
to
so
she
slipped
away
and
her
erstwhile
sweetheart
set
to
work
on
the
coffer
villain
said
hännchen
to
herself
when
she
was
outside
the
room
i
know
that
master
was
right
when
he
said
that
heinrich
was
no
fit
suitor
to
come
courting
with
that
she
slammed
the
door
to
and
turned
the
key
shutting
the
thief
in
a
room
as
secure
as
any
he
threatened
and
implored
her
but
hännchen
was
deaf
to
oaths
and
entreaties
alike
outside
she
found
the
son
playing
happily
and
called
him
to
her
to
father
as
quickly
as
you
can
she
said
putting
him
on
the
road
to
hersel
will
meet
him
down
there
tell
him
there
is
a
thief
in
the
the
child
ran
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
would
carry
him
but
ere
he
had
gone
many
yards
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
from
the
barred
window
behind
which
heinrich
was
imprisoned
shouted
the
robber
to
an
accomplice
in
hiding
the
child
and
come
and
stop
this
hännchen
looked
around
for
the
person
thus
addressed
but
no
one
was
in
sight
a
moment
later
however
diether
sprang
up
from
a
ditch
seized
the
frightened
boy
and
ran
back
toward
the
mill
the
girl
had
but
little
time
in
which
to
decide
on
a
course
of
action
if
she
barricaded
herself
in
the
mill
might
not
the
ruffian
slay
the
child
on
the
other
hand
if
she
waited
to
meet
him
she
had
no
assurance
that
he
would
not
kill
them
both
so
she
retired
to
the
mill
locked
the
door
and
awaited
what
fate
had
in
store
for
her
in
vain
the
robber
threatened
to
kill
the
child
and
burn
the
mill
over
her
head
if
she
would
not
open
to
him
at
once
seeing
that
his
threats
had
no
effect
he
cast
about
for
some
means
of
entering
the
mill
his
quick
eye
noted
one
unprotected
point
an
opening
in
the
wall
connected
with
the
big
a
by
no
means
easy
mode
of
ingress
but
finding
no
other
way
he
threw
the
frightened
child
on
the
grass
and
slipped
through
the
aperture
meanwhile
hännchen
who
from
the
position
of
her
upper
window
could
not
see
what
was
going
on
was
pondering
how
she
could
attract
the
attention
of
the
miller
or
any
of
their
neighbours
at
last
she
hit
upon
a
plan
it
was
sunday
and
the
mill
was
at
rest
if
she
were
to
set
the
machinery
in
motion
the
unusual
sight
of
a
mill
at
work
on
the
day
of
rest
would
surely
point
to
some
untoward
happening
hardly
had
the
idea
entered
her
head
ere
the
huge
sails
were
revolving
at
that
very
moment
diether
had
reached
the
interior
of
the
great
and
his
surprise
and
horror
were
unbounded
when
it
commenced
to
rotate
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
stop
the
machinery
useless
also
to
appeal
to
hännchen
round
and
round
he
went
till
at
last
he
fell
unconscious
on
the
bottom
of
the
engine
and
still
he
went
on
rotating
as
hännchen
had
anticipated
the
miller
and
his
family
were
vastly
astonished
to
see
the
mill
in
motion
and
hastened
home
from
church
to
learn
the
reason
for
this
departure
from
custom
some
of
their
neighbours
accompanied
them
in
a
few
words
hännchen
told
them
all
that
had
occurred
then
her
courage
forsook
her
and
she
fainted
in
the
arms
of
the
eldest
son
who
had
long
been
in
love
with
her
and
whom
she
afterward
married
the
robbers
were
taken
in
chains
to
bonn
where
for
their
many
crimes
they
suffered
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
rosebach
and
its
legend
the
quiet
and
peaceful
valley
of
hammerstein
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
all
rhineland
yet
like
many
another
lovely
stretch
of
country
this
valley
harbours
some
gruesome
tales
and
among
such
there
is
one
its
scene
the
village
of
rosebach
which
is
of
particular
interest
as
it
is
typical
of
the
middle
ages
and
casts
a
light
on
the
manner
of
life
and
thought
common
in
those
days
for
many
centuries
there
stood
at
this
village
of
rosebach
a
monastery
which
no
longer
exists
and
it
was
probably
one
of
its
early
abbots
who
first
wrote
down
the
legend
for
it
is
concerned
primarily
with
the
strange
events
which
led
to
the
founding
and
endowment
of
this
religious
house
and
its
whole
tenor
suggests
the
pen
of
a
medieval
cleric
in
a
remote
and
shadowy
time
there
lived
at
schloss
rosebach
a
certain
otto
count
of
of
hammerstein
and
this
evil
deeds
had
made
him
notorious
far
and
near
while
equally
was
his
favourite
henchman
riguenbach
by
name
a
man
who
had
borne
arms
in
the
crusades
and
had
long
since
renounced
all
belief
in
religion
this
ruffian
was
constantly
in
attendance
on
his
master
otto
and
one
day
when
the
pair
were
riding
along
the
together
they
chanced
to
espy
a
bewitching
maiden
who
was
making
her
way
from
a
neighbouring
village
to
the
convent
of
walsdorf
being
minded
to
enter
the
novitiate
there
and
eventually
take
the
veil
the
count
doffed
his
hat
to
the
prospective
nun
less
because
he
wished
to
be
courteous
than
because
it
was
his
habit
to
salute
every
wayfarer
he
encountered
on
his
domain
and
riguenbach
much
amused
by
civility
to
one
of
low
degree
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
of
derision
and
called
after
the
maiden
telling
her
to
come
back
she
obeyed
his
behest
and
thereupon
the
two
horsemen
drew
rein
and
asked
the
damsel
whither
she
was
bound
walsdorf
she
replied
and
though
otto
himself
would
have
let
her
go
forward
as
she
pleased
the
crafty
riguenbach
was
not
so
minded
are
many
dangers
in
the
way
he
said
to
the
girl
you
push
on
now
that
evening
is
drawing
near
you
may
fall
a
prey
to
robbers
or
wolves
so
you
had
better
come
to
the
castle
with
us
spend
the
night
there
and
continue
your
journey
on
the
pleased
by
the
apparently
friendly
offer
and
never
dreaming
of
the
fate
in
store
for
her
the
girl
willingly
accepted
the
invitation
that
night
the
people
around
schloss
rosebach
heard
piercing
screams
and
wondered
what
new
villainy
was
on
foot
but
the
massive
stone
walls
kept
their
secret
and
the
luckless
maiden
never
again
emerged
from
the
castle
for
a
time
the
crime
went
unpunished
and
about
a
year
later
he
commenced
paying
his
addresses
to
eldegarda
a
lady
of
noble
birth
in
due
course
the
nuptials
of
the
pair
were
celebrated
the
bride
had
little
idea
what
manner
of
man
she
had
espoused
but
she
was
destined
to
learn
this
shortly
for
on
the
very
night
of
their
marriage
an
apparition
rose
between
the
two
cried
the
ghost
in
weird
sepulchral
tones
alone
am
thy
lawful
spouse
through
thee
i
lost
all
hopes
of
heaven
and
now
i
am
come
to
reward
thee
for
thy
evil
the
count
turned
livid
with
fear
and
the
blush
on
cheek
faded
to
an
ashen
hue
but
the
spectre
remained
with
them
throughout
the
night
and
night
after
night
she
came
to
them
thus
till
at
last
otto
grew
desperate
and
summoned
to
his
aid
a
churchman
who
happened
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
the
abbot
bernard
of
clairvaux
now
this
bernard
enjoyed
no
small
fame
as
a
worker
of
miracles
but
when
otto
unfolded
his
case
to
him
the
abbot
declared
straightway
that
no
miracle
would
be
justifiable
in
the
present
instance
and
that
only
by
repentance
and
by
complete
renunciation
of
the
world
might
the
count
be
released
from
his
nightly
menace
otto
hung
his
head
on
hearing
this
verdict
and
as
he
stood
hesitating
pondering
whether
it
were
possible
for
him
to
forgo
all
earthly
joys
his
old
henchman
riguenbach
chanced
to
enter
and
learning
his
quandary
he
laughed
loudly
and
advised
the
count
to
eject
bernard
forcibly
the
abbot
met
the
mirth
with
a
look
of
great
severity
and
on
riguenbach
showing
that
he
was
still
bent
on
insolence
the
churchman
cried
to
him
thee
behind
me
whereupon
a
flame
of
lightning
darted
suddenly
across
the
chamber
and
the
man
who
had
long
aided
and
abetted
the
wickedness
was
consumed
to
ashes
for
a
moment
otto
stood
aghast
at
the
awful
fate
of
his
retainer
and
now
beholding
how
terrible
a
thing
is
divine
vengeance
he
began
at
last
to
feel
truly
repentant
he
consented
to
have
his
marriage
annulled
without
delay
and
even
declared
that
he
himself
would
become
a
monk
at
the
same
time
he
counselled
his
wife
to
take
the
veil
and
they
parted
thinking
never
to
see
each
other
again
but
one
night
ere
either
of
them
had
taken
the
irrevocable
vows
the
virgin
mary
appeared
to
abbot
bernard
and
told
him
he
had
acted
unwisely
in
parting
the
bride
and
bridegroom
in
this
wise
for
was
not
eldegarda
wholly
innocent
the
churchman
instantly
returned
to
presence
and
on
the
following
day
the
count
and
his
wife
were
duly
remarried
the
newly
found
piety
of
the
penitent
found
expression
in
the
building
and
endowment
of
a
religious
edifice
upon
his
domains
so
it
was
then
that
the
abbey
of
rosebach
was
founded
and
though
the
ruthless
hand
of
time
has
levelled
its
walls
the
strange
events
to
which
they
owed
their
being
long
ago
are
still
remembered
and
recited
in
the
lovely
vale
of
hammerstein
for
though
all
human
things
must
needs
perish
a
good
story
long
outlives
them
all
the
dancers
of
ramersdorf
at
ramersdorf
every
sunday
afternoon
the
lads
and
lasses
of
the
hamlet
gathered
on
the
village
green
and
danced
gaily
through
the
sunny
hours
but
wild
prophecies
of
the
coming
end
of
the
world
when
the
year
should
break
were
spreading
throughout
the
countryside
and
the
spirit
of
fear
haunted
the
people
so
that
music
died
away
from
their
hearts
and
there
was
no
more
dancing
on
the
village
green
instead
they
spent
the
hours
praying
in
the
church
for
divine
mercy
and
the
abbot
of
löwenburg
was
well
pleased
the
dreaded
year
came
and
went
yet
the
world
had
not
ceased
the
sun
still
rose
and
set
life
went
on
just
the
same
so
fear
passed
from
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
because
they
were
happy
again
the
young
folk
once
more
assembled
to
dance
the
sundays
away
on
the
village
green
but
the
abbot
was
wroth
at
this
when
the
music
began
he
appeared
among
the
villagers
commanding
them
to
cease
from
their
revels
and
bethink
themselves
of
the
house
of
god
but
the
lads
and
lasses
laughed
and
the
music
went
on
as
they
footed
it
gaily
then
the
abbot
was
angered
he
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
and
cursed
the
thoughtless
crowd
condemning
the
villagers
to
dance
there
unceasingly
for
a
year
and
a
day
as
they
heard
the
dreadful
words
the
young
folk
tried
to
stop
but
their
feet
must
needs
go
on
to
the
endless
music
faster
and
faster
in
giddy
round
they
went
day
and
night
rain
and
shine
throughout
the
changing
seasons
until
the
last
hours
of
the
extra
day
when
they
fell
in
a
senseless
heap
in
the
hollow
worn
by
their
unresting
feet
when
they
awoke
to
consciousness
all
reason
had
passed
from
them
to
the
day
of
their
death
they
remained
helpless
idiots
henceforth
the
village
green
was
deserted
no
more
were
seen
the
lads
and
lasses
dancing
there
on
the
sabbath
day
the
löwenburg
tradition
asserts
that
on
the
summit
of
this
mountain
once
stood
a
castle
of
which
however
not
the
slightest
trace
can
be
found
at
the
present
day
there
is
also
a
story
of
the
lord
who
dwelt
there
hermann
von
heinsberg
with
whom
for
his
sins
the
direct
line
of
the
family
became
extinct
graf
hermann
was
possessed
by
one
overmastering
passion
that
of
the
chase
the
greater
part
of
his
life
was
spent
in
the
dense
forests
which
clothed
the
valleys
and
mountains
about
his
castle
every
other
interest
must
perforce
stand
aside
the
cornfields
vineyards
and
gardens
of
his
vassals
were
oftentimes
devastated
in
his
sport
to
the
utter
ruin
of
many
if
any
dared
complain
he
laughed
at
or
reviled
them
but
if
he
were
in
angry
mood
he
set
his
hounds
on
them
and
hunted
his
vassals
as
quarry
either
killing
them
outright
or
leaving
them
terribly
injured
needless
to
say
he
was
well
hated
by
these
people
also
by
his
own
class
for
his
character
was
too
fierce
and
overbearing
even
for
their
tolerance
to
crown
his
unpopularity
he
was
under
the
ban
of
the
church
for
days
and
day
alike
he
hunted
to
his
content
and
once
on
receiving
a
remonstrance
had
threatened
to
hunt
the
abbot
of
heisterbach
himself
so
he
lived
isolated
except
for
his
troop
of
jägers
from
the
rest
of
mankind
the
forest
was
his
world
his
only
friends
the
hounds
once
on
the
eve
of
a
holy
festival
hermann
set
out
to
hunt
in
the
ancient
forest
about
the
base
of
the
löwenburg
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
he
outstripped
his
followers
his
quarry
disappeared
and
overtaken
by
night
his
surroundings
in
the
dim
light
took
on
such
an
unfamiliar
aspect
that
he
completely
lost
all
sense
of
direction
up
and
down
he
paced
in
unrestrained
yet
impotent
anger
feeling
that
he
was
under
some
evil
spell
maddened
by
this
idea
he
endeavoured
to
hack
his
way
through
the
thick
undergrowth
but
the
matted
boughs
and
dense
foliage
were
as
effectual
as
prison
bars
he
was
trapped
he
told
himself
in
some
enchanted
forest
for
the
place
seemed
more
and
more
unfamiliar
he
strove
to
bring
back
some
recollection
of
the
spot
which
surely
he
must
have
passed
a
thousand
times
but
could
not
distinguish
any
feature
that
seemed
familiar
his
spirits
sank
lower
and
lower
his
strength
seemed
on
the
point
of
failing
his
brain
seemed
to
be
on
fire
round
and
round
he
went
like
some
trapped
animal
then
he
threw
himself
madly
upon
a
mass
of
tangled
underwood
and
succeeded
in
breaking
through
to
a
more
open
space
this
also
seemed
unfamiliar
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
the
tall
trees
shut
him
in
as
if
with
towers
of
impenetrable
shadow
silence
seemed
to
lay
everything
under
a
spell
of
terror
ominous
of
coming
evil
wearied
in
body
and
mind
hermann
flung
himself
down
on
the
sward
and
quickly
fell
asleep
but
suddenly
a
plunging
in
the
brushwood
aroused
him
and
with
the
instinct
of
the
huntsman
he
sprang
up
instantly
seizing
his
spear
and
whistling
to
his
dogs
which
however
crouched
nearer
to
the
earth
their
hair
bristling
and
eyes
red
with
fear
again
their
master
called
but
they
refused
to
stir
whining
with
eyes
strained
and
fixed
on
the
undergrowth
then
graf
hermann
went
forward
alone
to
the
spot
whence
proceeded
the
ominous
sound
his
spear
poised
ready
to
strike
he
was
about
to
penetrate
into
the
brushwood
when
suddenly
there
emerged
from
it
a
man
who
seemed
as
if
hotly
pursued
he
was
dressed
in
ancient
garb
carrying
a
large
crossbow
in
his
right
hand
a
curved
hung
at
his
side
and
an
was
stuck
in
his
girdle
with
a
stately
motion
of
the
hand
he
waved
hermann
aside
then
he
raised
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
blew
upon
it
a
terrible
blast
so
unearthly
in
sound
that
the
forest
and
mountains
sent
back
echoes
like
the
cry
of
the
lost
to
which
the
hounds
gave
tongue
with
a
howl
of
fear
as
if
in
answer
to
the
echoes
there
suddenly
appeared
hundreds
of
skeleton
stags
of
enormous
size
each
bestridden
by
a
skeleton
hunter
with
one
accord
the
ghostly
riders
spurred
on
their
steeds
which
with
lowered
antlers
advanced
upon
the
stranger
who
with
a
scream
for
mercy
sought
frenziedly
for
some
means
of
evading
his
grisly
pursuers
for
the
space
of
an
hour
the
dreadful
chase
went
on
graf
hermann
rooted
to
the
spot
with
horror
overcome
by
a
sense
of
helplessness
there
in
the
centre
he
stood
the
pivot
round
which
circled
the
infernal
hunt
unable
to
stay
the
relentless
riders
as
with
bony
hands
rattling
against
their
skeleton
steeds
they
encouraged
them
to
charge
gore
and
trample
the
hapless
stranger
whose
cries
of
agony
were
drowned
by
shrieks
of
fiendish
glee
and
the
incessant
cracking
of
whips
overcome
at
last
by
terror
the
count
fell
senseless
his
eyes
dazed
by
the
still
whirling
spectres
and
their
flying
quarry
when
at
last
he
slowly
awaked
from
his
swoon
he
looked
around
fearing
to
see
again
the
hideous
spectacle
all
but
the
stranger
however
had
vanished
graf
hermann
shuddered
as
he
looked
upon
him
and
only
with
difficulty
could
he
summon
sufficient
courage
to
address
him
indeed
it
was
only
after
the
unwonted
action
of
crossing
himself
that
he
could
speak
and
what
are
you
he
asked
in
a
hushed
tone
but
the
stranger
made
no
reply
except
to
sigh
mournfully
again
the
count
asked
the
question
and
again
received
but
a
sigh
for
answer
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
god
i
conjure
you
speak
he
said
the
third
time
the
stranger
turned
to
him
as
if
suddenly
released
from
bonds
the
power
of
holy
name
the
spell
is
broken
at
last
listen
now
to
me
he
beckoned
hermann
to
his
side
and
in
strange
stern
tones
he
related
the
following
am
your
ancestor
like
you
i
loved
the
chase
beyond
everything
in
our
holy
faith
or
the
welfare
of
any
human
being
man
woman
or
child
to
all
that
stood
in
my
path
i
showed
no
mercy
there
came
a
time
when
famine
visited
the
land
the
harvest
was
destroyed
by
blight
and
the
people
starved
in
their
extremity
they
broke
into
my
forests
famished
with
hunger
they
destroyed
and
carried
off
the
game
beside
myself
with
rage
i
swore
that
they
should
suffer
for
for
every
head
of
game
destroyed
i
would
exact
a
human
life
i
kept
my
oath
arming
my
retainers
servants
and
huntsmen
i
seized
my
presumptuous
vassals
in
the
dead
of
night
and
dragging
them
to
the
castle
i
flung
them
into
the
deepest
dungeons
there
for
three
days
i
let
them
three
days
also
i
kept
my
hounds
without
food
meantime
my
huntsmen
had
caught
a
great
number
of
the
largest
and
strongest
deer
in
the
forests
at
the
end
of
three
days
the
unfortunate
wretches
were
brought
out
diminished
now
by
a
full
hundred
my
ready
retainers
bound
them
naked
to
the
stags
my
best
steeds
were
saddled
then
the
kennels
were
thrown
open
and
the
famished
hounds
rushed
forth
like
a
host
of
demons
off
went
the
deer
like
the
wind
each
with
his
human
burden
the
dogs
following
and
then
the
horsemen
shouting
with
glee
at
the
new
sport
by
nightfall
not
a
stag
or
his
rider
was
left
alive
the
hounds
in
their
fury
worried
and
tore
at
both
man
and
beast
and
the
last
unfortunate
wretch
met
a
hideous
death
on
this
spot
where
we
now
he
paused
as
if
overcome
by
the
memory
of
his
crime
avenged
that
dreadful
deed
that
night
i
died
and
i
am
now
suffering
the
tortures
of
the
damned
every
night
i
am
hunted
by
my
victims
as
you
have
seen
i
am
now
the
quarry
hunted
from
the
castle
court
on
through
the
forest
to
this
hidden
and
haunted
spot
thousands
and
thousands
of
times
i
have
suffered
this
i
endure
all
the
agonies
i
made
them
suffer
i
am
doomed
to
undergo
this
to
the
last
day
when
i
shall
be
hunted
over
the
wastes
of
hell
by
legions
of
again
he
paused
his
eyes
terrible
with
the
anguish
of
a
lost
soul
he
resumed
in
a
sterner
tone
warning
by
my
fate
providence
kinder
to
you
than
to
me
has
guided
you
hither
that
you
might
learn
of
my
punishment
while
you
still
have
time
repent
of
your
crimes
and
endeavour
to
make
amends
for
the
suffering
you
have
inflicted
wages
of
sin
is
death
remember
my
fate
the
next
moment
the
phantom
had
faded
from
view
only
the
hounds
were
crouching
near
the
count
panting
fearfully
all
else
was
silent
gloom
and
night
after
a
terrible
vigil
the
morning
came
and
graf
hermann
now
a
changed
man
returned
to
his
castle
in
silence
and
henceforth
endeavoured
to
profit
by
the
warning
and
follow
the
advice
of
his
unhappy
ancestor
chapter
to
rheinstein
the
rock
among
the
many
legends
invented
by
the
early
christian
monks
to
advance
their
faith
there
are
few
more
beautiful
than
that
attached
to
the
drachenfels
the
rock
a
rugged
and
picturesque
mass
of
volcanic
porphyry
rising
above
the
rhine
on
its
right
bank
up
one
of
its
pointed
crags
is
a
dark
cavern
known
as
the
cave
which
was
at
one
time
in
that
misty
past
to
which
all
legends
belong
the
habitation
of
a
hideous
monster
and
the
peasants
of
the
surrounding
district
held
the
creature
in
superstitious
awe
worshipped
him
and
offered
up
sacrifices
of
human
beings
at
the
instigation
of
their
pagan
priests
foremost
among
the
worshippers
of
the
dragon
were
two
warrior
princes
rinbod
and
horsrik
who
frequently
made
an
onslaught
on
the
christian
people
dwelling
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
rhine
carrying
off
many
captives
to
be
offered
as
sacrifices
to
the
dragon
on
one
such
occasion
while
according
to
their
custom
they
were
dividing
their
prisoners
the
pagan
princes
quarrelled
over
one
of
their
captives
a
christian
maiden
whose
beauty
and
helpless
innocence
won
the
hearts
of
her
fierce
captors
so
that
each
desired
to
possess
her
and
neither
was
inclined
to
renounce
his
claim
the
quarrel
became
so
bitter
at
length
that
the
princes
seized
their
weapons
and
were
about
to
fight
for
the
fair
spoil
but
at
this
juncture
their
priests
intervened
is
not
meet
said
they
two
noble
princes
should
come
to
blows
over
a
mere
christian
maid
tomorrow
she
shall
be
offered
to
the
dragon
in
thanksgiving
for
your
and
they
felt
that
they
had
done
well
for
had
they
not
averted
the
impending
quarrel
and
at
the
same
time
gained
a
victim
for
their
cruel
rites
but
the
heart
of
rinbod
was
heavy
indeed
for
he
truly
loved
the
young
christian
maid
and
would
have
given
his
life
to
save
her
from
the
horrible
fate
that
awaited
her
however
the
decree
of
the
priests
was
irrevocable
and
no
pleadings
of
his
could
avail
the
girl
was
informed
of
the
cruel
destiny
that
was
to
befall
her
on
the
morrow
and
with
a
calm
mind
she
sought
consolation
from
heaven
to
enable
her
to
meet
her
fate
with
courage
befitting
a
christian
early
on
the
following
morning
she
was
led
with
much
ceremony
to
a
spot
before
the
cave
and
there
bound
to
an
oak
to
await
the
approach
of
the
monster
whose
custom
it
was
to
sally
forth
at
sunrise
in
search
of
prey
the
procession
of
priests
warriors
and
peasants
who
had
followed
the
victim
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
now
climbed
to
the
summit
of
the
crag
and
watched
eagerly
for
the
coming
of
the
dragon
rinbod
watched
also
but
it
was
with
eyes
full
of
anguish
and
apprehension
the
christian
maid
seemed
to
him
more
like
a
spirit
than
a
human
being
so
calmly
so
steadfastly
did
she
bear
herself
suddenly
a
stifled
cry
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
hideous
monster
was
seen
dragging
its
heavy
coils
from
the
cavern
fire
issuing
from
its
mouth
and
nostrils
at
its
mighty
roar
even
the
bravest
trembled
but
the
christian
maid
alone
showed
no
sign
of
fear
she
awaited
the
oncoming
of
the
dreadful
creature
with
a
hymn
of
praise
on
her
lips
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
dragon
and
at
length
with
a
horrible
roar
it
sprang
at
its
prey
but
even
as
it
did
so
the
maiden
held
out
her
crucifix
before
her
and
the
dragon
was
checked
in
its
onrush
a
moment
later
it
turned
aside
and
plunged
into
the
rhine
the
people
on
the
crag
were
filled
with
awe
at
the
miraculous
power
of
the
strange
symbol
which
had
overcome
their
idol
and
descending
hastened
to
free
the
young
girl
from
her
bonds
when
they
learned
the
significance
of
the
cross
they
begged
that
she
would
send
them
teachers
that
they
might
learn
about
the
new
religion
in
vain
their
priests
endeavoured
to
dissuade
them
they
had
seen
the
power
of
the
crucifix
and
their
renunciation
of
their
pagan
creed
was
complete
among
the
first
to
adopt
the
christian
religion
was
rinbod
he
married
the
beautiful
captive
and
built
a
castle
for
her
on
the
drachenfels
whose
ruins
remain
to
this
day
it
seems
a
pity
that
such
a
beautiful
legend
should
have
doubts
cast
upon
its
authenticity
but
it
has
been
conjectured
that
the
word
drachenfels
has
a
geological
rather
than
a
romantic
in
fact
derived
from
meaning
this
view
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
there
is
another
drachenfels
near
mannheim
of
a
similar
geological
construction
but
without
the
legend
however
it
is
unlikely
that
the
people
of
antiquity
would
bestow
a
geological
name
upon
any
locality
okkenfels
a
rash
oath
on
a
rugged
crag
overlooking
the
rhine
above
the
town
of
linz
stands
the
ruined
stronghold
of
okkenfels
history
tells
us
little
or
nothing
concerning
this
ancient
fortress
but
legend
covers
the
deficiency
with
the
tale
of
the
rash
oath
rheinhard
von
renneberg
according
to
the
story
flourished
about
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
when
the
schloss
okkenfels
was
a
favourite
rendezvous
with
the
rude
nobility
of
the
surrounding
district
though
they
were
none
of
them
distinguished
for
their
manners
by
far
the
most
rugged
and
uncouth
was
the
baron
von
renneberg
himself
rough
in
appearance
abrupt
in
conversation
and
inclined
to
harshness
in
all
his
dealings
he
inspired
in
the
breast
of
his
only
daughter
a
feeling
more
akin
to
awe
than
affection
the
gentle
etelina
grew
up
to
be
a
maiden
of
singular
beauty
of
delicate
form
and
feature
and
under
the
careful
tutelage
of
the
castle
chaplain
she
became
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
lovers
she
had
in
plenty
for
the
charms
of
etelina
and
the
wealth
of
her
noble
father
whose
sole
heiress
she
was
formed
a
combination
quite
irresistible
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
gallants
who
frequented
the
castle
but
none
loved
her
more
sincerely
than
one
of
the
retainers
a
young
knight
of
linz
rudolph
by
name
on
one
occasion
rheinhard
was
obliged
to
set
out
with
his
troop
to
join
the
wars
in
italy
and
ere
he
departed
he
confided
his
daughter
to
the
care
of
the
venerable
chaplain
while
his
castle
and
lands
he
left
in
charge
of
sir
rudolph
as
may
be
supposed
the
knight
and
the
maiden
frequently
met
and
ere
long
it
became
evident
that
passion
was
returned
the
worthy
chaplain
who
loved
the
youth
as
a
son
did
not
seek
to
interfere
with
the
course
of
his
wooing
and
so
in
due
time
the
lovers
were
betrothed
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
alarming
news
reached
them
that
the
baron
was
returning
from
the
wars
bringing
in
his
train
a
noble
bridegroom
for
etelina
in
despair
the
lovers
sought
the
old
chaplain
and
begged
his
advice
they
knew
only
too
well
that
the
baron
would
not
brook
resistance
to
his
will
for
he
had
ever
dealt
ruthlessly
with
opposition
yet
both
were
determined
that
nothing
should
part
them
would
rather
die
with
rudolph
than
marry
another
cried
the
maiden
and
indeed
it
seemed
that
one
or
other
of
these
alternatives
would
soon
fall
to
her
lot
but
the
wise
old
priest
was
planning
a
way
of
escape
were
meant
for
one
another
my
children
he
said
philosophically
it
is
not
for
man
to
separate
you
i
will
marry
you
at
once
and
i
know
a
place
where
you
may
safely
hide
for
a
it
was
nearing
midnight
on
the
eve
of
the
day
fixed
for
return
so
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
the
three
repaired
to
the
chapel
where
the
marriage
was
at
once
solemnized
taking
a
basket
of
bread
meat
and
wine
a
lamp
and
some
other
necessaries
the
old
man
conducted
the
newly
married
pair
through
a
subterranean
passage
to
a
cavern
in
the
rock
whereon
the
castle
stood
a
place
known
only
to
himself
then
having
blessed
them
he
withdrew
early
on
the
following
morning
came
the
baron
and
his
train
with
the
noble
knight
chosen
as
a
husband
for
etelina
rheinhard
looked
in
vain
for
his
daughter
among
the
crowd
of
retainers
who
waited
to
welcome
him
is
my
little
maid
he
asked
the
chaplain
answered
evasively
the
damsel
was
ill
abed
he
replied
when
the
noble
lord
had
refreshed
himself
he
should
see
her
directly
the
repast
was
over
he
hastened
to
his
apartment
only
to
find
her
flown
dismayed
and
angry
he
rushed
to
the
chaplain
and
demanded
an
explanation
the
good
old
man
after
a
vain
attempt
to
soothe
his
irate
patron
revealed
that
is
save
the
place
where
the
fugitives
were
concealed
and
that
he
firmly
refused
to
divulge
the
priest
was
committed
to
the
lowest
dungeon
a
vile
den
to
which
access
could
only
be
got
by
means
of
a
and
a
rope
with
his
own
hands
the
baron
swung
to
the
massive
trap
swearing
a
deep
oath
i
forgive
my
daughter
or
any
of
her
accomplices
may
i
die
suddenly
where
i
now
stand
and
may
my
soul
perish
for
ever
the
disappointed
bridegroom
soon
returned
to
his
own
land
and
the
baron
whose
increasing
moroseness
made
him
cordially
hated
by
his
attendants
was
left
to
the
bitterness
of
his
thoughts
meanwhile
rudolph
and
his
bride
had
escaped
unseen
from
the
castle
rock
and
now
dwelt
in
the
forests
skirting
the
seven
mountains
while
the
summer
lasted
all
went
well
with
them
they
and
the
little
son
who
was
born
to
them
were
content
with
the
sustenance
the
forest
afforded
but
in
the
winter
all
was
changed
starvation
stared
them
in
the
face
more
and
more
pitiful
became
their
condition
till
at
length
rudolph
resolved
to
seek
the
baron
and
give
his
life
if
need
be
to
save
his
wife
and
child
that
very
day
rheinhard
was
out
hunting
in
the
forest
imagine
his
surprise
when
a
gaunt
figure
clad
in
a
bearskin
stepped
from
the
undergrowth
and
bade
him
follow
if
he
wished
to
see
his
daughter
alive
the
startled
old
man
obeyed
the
summons
and
arrived
at
length
before
a
spacious
cavern
which
his
guide
motioned
him
to
enter
within
on
a
pile
of
damp
leaves
lay
etelina
and
her
child
both
with
starvation
anger
speedily
melted
at
the
pathetic
sight
and
he
freely
forgave
his
daughter
and
rudolph
his
hitherto
unrecognized
guide
and
bade
them
return
with
him
to
okkenfels
first
request
was
for
a
pardon
for
the
old
chaplain
and
rheinhard
himself
went
to
raise
the
heavy
while
peering
into
the
gloom
however
he
stumbled
and
fell
headlong
into
the
dungeon
below
judgment
he
shrieked
as
he
fell
then
all
was
silence
the
bruised
remains
of
the
proud
baron
were
interred
in
the
parish
church
of
linz
and
henceforth
etelina
and
her
husband
lived
happily
at
okkenfels
but
both
they
and
the
old
chaplain
offered
many
a
pious
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
unhappy
baron
rheinhard
oberwörth
in
the
middle
of
the
rhine
a
little
above
coblentz
lies
the
island
of
oberwörth
where
at
one
time
stood
a
famous
nunnery
included
in
the
traditional
lore
of
the
neighbourhood
is
a
tragic
tale
of
the
beautiful
ida
daughter
of
the
freiherr
von
metternich
who
died
within
its
walls
in
the
fourteenth
century
von
metternich
who
dwelt
at
coblentz
was
a
wealthy
and
powerful
noble
exceedingly
proud
of
his
fair
daughter
and
firmly
convinced
that
none
but
the
highest
in
the
land
was
fit
mate
for
her
but
ida
had
other
views
and
had
already
bestowed
her
heart
on
a
young
squire
in
her
train
it
is
true
that
gerbert
was
a
youth
of
stainless
life
pleasing
appearance
and
gentle
manners
and
moreover
one
who
was
likely
at
no
distant
date
to
win
his
spurs
nevertheless
the
lovers
instinctively
concealed
their
mutual
affection
from
von
metternich
and
plighted
their
troth
in
secret
but
so
ardent
an
affection
could
not
long
remain
hidden
the
time
came
when
the
nobleman
discovered
how
matters
stood
between
his
daughter
and
gerbert
and
with
angry
frowns
and
muttered
oaths
he
resolved
to
exercise
his
paternal
authority
daughter
shall
go
to
a
nunnery
he
said
to
himself
as
for
that
jackanapes
he
must
be
got
rid
of
at
he
pondered
how
he
might
conveniently
rid
himself
of
the
audacious
squire
that
night
he
dispatched
gerbert
on
a
mission
to
the
grand
prior
of
the
who
had
his
abode
at
the
neighbouring
castle
of
lahneck
the
unsuspecting
squire
took
the
sealed
missive
and
set
out
thinking
as
he
rode
along
how
rich
he
was
in
possessing
so
sweet
a
love
as
ida
and
dreaming
of
the
time
when
his
valour
and
prowess
should
have
made
their
marriage
possible
but
his
dreams
would
have
been
rudely
disturbed
had
he
seen
what
was
passing
at
coblentz
for
his
betrothed
in
spite
of
her
tears
and
pleadings
was
being
secretly
conveyed
to
the
nunnery
of
oberwörth
there
to
remain
until
she
should
have
forgotten
her
though
the
stone
walls
of
a
convent
could
shut
out
the
imaginings
of
a
maid
however
gerbert
knew
nothing
of
this
and
he
rode
along
in
leisurely
fashion
until
at
length
he
came
to
the
schloss
lahneck
where
he
was
at
once
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
grand
prior
of
the
the
grand
prior
was
a
man
of
middle
age
with
an
expression
of
settled
melancholy
on
his
swarthy
features
gerbert
approached
him
with
becoming
reverence
bent
his
knee
and
presented
the
missive
the
prior
turned
his
gaze
so
earnestly
on
the
young
face
that
gerbert
dropped
his
eyes
in
confusion
a
moment
later
the
prior
broke
the
seal
and
hastily
scanned
the
letter
mayest
thou
be
youth
he
asked
abruptly
von
isenburg
thy
mother
von
isenburg
was
the
astonished
reply
the
prior
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
deep
emotion
thou
the
purport
of
this
missive
he
said
at
last
concerns
me
not
answered
gerbert
simply
my
son
said
the
prior
doth
concern
thee
and
deeply
too
know
that
it
is
thy
boy
the
freiherr
has
requested
me
to
send
thee
to
the
wars
in
palestine
and
so
to
place
thee
that
death
will
be
a
certainty
this
he
asks
in
the
name
of
our
ancient
friendship
and
for
the
sake
of
our
order
to
which
he
has
ever
shown
himself
well
seeing
the
dismay
and
incredulity
which
were
depicted
in
his
face
the
prior
hastened
to
read
aloud
a
passage
describing
von
discovery
of
his
love
for
the
humble
squire
and
gerbert
could
no
longer
doubt
that
his
fate
was
sealed
the
prior
looked
at
him
kindly
he
said
am
not
going
to
put
the
cruel
order
into
execution
though
i
lose
friendship
the
honour
of
our
order
life
itself
the
son
of
guba
von
isenburg
shall
not
suffer
at
my
hands
i
sympathize
with
thy
passion
for
the
fair
ida
i
myself
loved
thy
the
impetuous
gerbert
started
to
his
feet
hand
on
sword
at
the
mention
of
his
mother
whose
good
name
he
set
before
all
else
but
with
a
dignified
gesture
the
prior
motioned
him
to
his
seat
then
in
terse
passionate
phrases
the
elder
man
told
how
he
had
loved
the
gentle
guba
for
years
always
hesitating
to
declare
his
passion
lest
the
lady
should
scorn
him
at
length
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
made
up
his
mind
to
reveal
his
love
to
her
with
this
intent
he
rode
toward
her
home
only
to
learn
from
a
passing
page
that
guba
his
mistress
was
to
be
married
that
very
day
to
von
isenburg
he
gave
to
the
page
a
ring
bidding
him
carry
it
to
his
mistress
with
the
message
that
it
was
from
one
who
loved
her
greatly
and
who
for
her
sake
renounced
the
world
ring
he
concluded
on
thy
finger
and
in
thy
face
and
voice
are
thy
likeness
canst
thou
wonder
that
i
would
spare
thy
life
gerbert
listened
in
respectful
silence
his
love
for
ida
enabled
him
to
sympathize
with
the
pathetic
tale
unfolded
by
the
prior
tears
fell
unchecked
from
the
eyes
of
both
now
said
the
prior
at
last
must
look
to
thy
would
not
bring
misfortune
on
thee
said
gerbert
i
not
go
to
palestine
and
win
my
way
through
with
my
sword
is
impossible
said
the
elder
man
metternich
would
see
to
it
that
thou
wert
slain
thou
must
go
to
swabia
where
a
prior
of
our
order
will
look
after
thy
safety
in
the
the
same
day
gerbert
was
conveyed
to
swabia
where
for
a
time
at
least
he
was
safe
from
persecution
the
dance
of
death
in
the
nunnery
of
oberwörth
on
a
pallet
in
a
humble
cell
ida
lay
dying
a
year
had
gone
past
since
she
had
been
separated
from
her
lover
and
every
day
had
seen
her
grow
weaker
and
more
despondent
forget
gerbert
that
would
she
never
while
life
remained
to
her
wearily
she
tossed
on
her
pallet
her
only
companion
a
sister
of
the
convent
willingly
now
would
the
freiherr
give
his
dearest
possessions
to
save
his
daughter
but
already
she
was
beyond
assistance
her
only
hope
the
peace
of
the
grave
am
dying
sister
she
said
to
her
attendant
shall
i
see
my
dear
murmured
the
nun
gently
things
have
happened
all
may
yet
be
and
to
divert
the
dying
attention
from
her
grief
she
recited
tales
of
lovers
who
had
been
reunited
after
many
difficulties
but
ida
refused
to
be
pacified
she
said
am
betrothed
yet
i
must
die
forbid
cried
the
pious
nun
in
alarm
then
must
thou
join
in
the
dance
of
it
was
a
popular
belief
in
that
district
that
a
betrothed
maiden
who
died
before
her
wedding
was
celebrated
must
after
her
death
dance
on
a
spot
in
the
centre
of
the
island
whereon
no
grass
or
herb
ever
is
unless
in
the
interval
she
took
the
veil
every
night
at
twelve
a
band
of
such
hapless
maidens
may
be
seen
dancing
in
the
moonlight
doomed
to
continue
their
nocturnal
revels
till
they
meet
with
a
lover
and
woe
betide
the
knight
who
ventures
within
their
reach
they
dance
round
and
round
him
and
with
him
till
he
falls
dead
whereupon
the
youngest
maid
claims
him
for
her
lover
henceforth
she
rests
quietly
in
her
grave
and
joins
no
more
in
the
ghostly
frolic
this
weird
tradition
ida
now
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
nun
who
herself
claimed
to
have
witnessed
the
scenes
she
described
beseech
thee
said
the
sister
but
join
our
convent
and
all
will
yet
be
die
murmured
ida
heeding
not
the
words
of
her
companion
shall
meet
again
gerbert
her
lover
heard
the
sad
news
in
his
on
the
shores
of
lake
constance
and
returned
to
oberwörth
with
all
speed
a
week
had
elapsed
ere
he
arrived
and
body
was
already
interred
in
the
vaults
of
the
convent
it
was
a
night
of
storm
and
darkness
no
boatman
would
venture
on
the
rhine
but
gerbert
anxious
to
pay
the
last
respects
to
the
body
of
his
beloved
was
not
to
be
deterred
with
his
own
hands
he
unmoored
a
vessel
and
sailed
across
to
oberwörth
having
landed
at
that
part
of
the
island
furthest
from
the
convent
he
was
obliged
to
pass
the
haunted
spot
on
his
way
thither
the
circular
patch
of
barren
earth
was
said
to
be
a
spot
accursed
by
reason
of
sacrilege
and
suicide
committed
there
but
such
things
were
far
from
the
thoughts
of
the
distraught
knight
suddenly
he
heard
a
strange
sound
like
the
whisper
of
a
familiar
sound
which
despite
its
quietness
seemed
to
make
itself
heard
above
the
fury
of
the
storm
looking
up
he
beheld
a
band
of
maidens
dancing
in
the
charmed
circle
one
of
them
a
little
apart
from
the
others
seemed
to
him
to
be
his
lost
ida
the
familiar
figure
the
grace
of
mien
the
very
gesture
with
which
she
beckoned
him
were
hers
and
he
rushed
forward
to
clasp
her
to
his
heart
adroitly
she
eluded
his
grasp
and
mingled
with
the
throng
gerbert
followed
with
bursting
heart
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
found
that
the
other
phantoms
had
surrounded
them
something
in
the
unearthly
music
fascinated
him
he
felt
impelled
to
dance
round
and
round
till
his
head
reeled
and
still
he
danced
with
his
phantom
bride
and
still
the
maidens
whirled
about
them
on
the
stroke
of
one
the
dancers
vanished
and
the
knight
sank
to
the
ground
all
but
dead
with
fatigue
in
the
morning
he
was
found
by
the
kindly
nuns
who
tended
him
carefully
but
all
their
skill
and
attention
were
in
vain
for
gerbert
lived
only
long
enough
to
tell
of
his
adventure
to
the
sisterhood
this
done
he
expired
with
the
name
of
his
beloved
upon
his
lips
stolzenfels
the
alchemist
alchemy
was
a
common
pursuit
in
the
middle
ages
the
poor
followed
it
eagerly
in
the
vain
desire
for
gold
the
rich
spent
their
wealth
in
useless
experiments
or
showered
it
on
worthless
charlatans
thus
it
came
about
that
archbishop
werner
of
falkenstein
owner
of
the
grim
fortress
of
stolzenfels
and
a
wealthy
and
powerful
churchman
was
an
amateur
of
the
hermetic
art
while
his
treasurer
who
was
by
no
means
rich
was
also
by
way
of
being
an
alchemist
to
indulge
his
passion
for
the
bizarre
science
the
latter
had
extracted
many
a
golden
piece
from
the
coffers
of
his
reverend
master
always
meaning
of
course
to
pay
them
back
when
the
weary
experiments
should
have
crystallized
into
the
coveted
stone
he
had
in
his
daughter
elizabeth
a
treasure
which
might
well
have
outweighed
the
whole
of
the
coffers
but
the
lust
for
gold
had
blinded
the
covetous
treasurer
to
all
else
one
wild
stormy
night
when
the
wind
tore
shrieking
round
the
battlements
of
came
to
the
gate
a
pilgrim
sombre
of
feature
as
of
garb
with
wicked
glinting
eyes
the
archbishop
was
not
at
that
time
resident
in
the
castle
but
his
treasurer
hearing
that
the
was
learned
in
alchemical
mysteries
bade
him
enter
without
delay
a
room
was
made
ready
in
one
of
the
highest
towers
and
there
the
treasurer
and
his
pilgrim
friend
spent
many
days
and
nights
elizabeth
saw
with
dismay
that
a
change
was
coming
over
her
father
he
was
no
longer
gentle
and
kind
but
morose
and
reserved
and
he
passed
less
time
in
her
company
than
he
was
wont
at
length
a
courier
arrived
with
tidings
of
the
approach
of
the
archbishop
who
was
bringing
some
noble
guests
to
the
castle
to
the
dismay
of
his
daughter
the
treasurer
suddenly
turned
pale
and
brushing
aside
her
solicitous
inquiries
fled
to
the
mysterious
chamber
elizabeth
followed
convinced
that
something
had
occurred
to
upset
her
father
seriously
she
was
too
door
was
locked
ere
she
reached
it
but
she
could
hear
angry
voices
within
the
voices
of
her
father
and
the
pilgrim
the
treasurer
seemed
to
be
uttering
bitter
reproaches
while
ever
and
anon
the
deep
level
voice
of
his
companion
could
be
heard
hither
a
virgin
he
said
blood
of
a
virgin
is
necessary
to
our
schemes
as
i
have
told
thee
many
times
how
can
i
give
thee
gold
and
thou
wilt
not
obey
my
instructions
cried
the
treasurer
beside
himself
hast
taken
my
gold
thou
hast
made
me
take
the
gold
of
my
master
also
for
thy
schemes
wouldst
thou
have
me
shed
innocent
blood
tell
thee
again
without
it
our
experiments
are
at
that
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
treasurer
emerged
too
immersed
in
his
anxious
thoughts
to
perceive
the
shrinking
form
of
elizabeth
she
when
he
had
gone
from
sight
entered
the
chamber
where
stood
the
pilgrim
have
heard
thy
conversation
she
said
i
am
ready
to
give
my
life
for
my
welfare
tell
me
what
i
must
do
and
i
will
slay
me
with
mine
own
with
covetous
glance
the
pilgrim
advanced
and
strove
to
take
her
hand
but
she
shrank
back
in
loathing
me
not
she
said
shuddering
a
look
of
malice
overspread
the
averted
face
hither
at
midnight
and
at
sunrise
thy
father
will
be
rich
and
honoured
he
said
thou
swear
it
on
the
cross
swear
it
he
returned
drawing
a
little
crucifix
from
his
bosom
and
speaking
in
solemn
tones
well
i
and
with
that
she
withdrew
when
she
had
gone
the
alchemist
pressed
a
spring
in
the
crucifix
when
a
dagger
fell
out
hast
served
me
well
he
said
chuckling
then
replacing
the
crucifix
in
his
breast
he
entered
the
adjoining
room
prised
up
a
stone
from
the
floor
and
drew
forth
a
leathern
bag
full
of
gold
this
then
was
the
crucible
into
which
the
pieces
had
gone
have
found
the
secret
of
making
gold
pursued
the
pilgrim
my
wealth
and
i
will
be
far
away
in
safety
the
fools
to
seek
gold
in
a
crucible
meanwhile
preparations
were
afoot
for
the
reception
of
the
archbishop
elizabeth
full
of
grief
and
determination
supervised
the
work
of
the
while
her
father
anxiously
wondered
how
he
should
account
to
his
master
for
the
stolen
pieces
of
gold
the
archbishop
was
loudly
hailed
on
his
arrival
he
greeted
his
treasurer
kindly
and
asked
after
the
pretty
elizabeth
when
her
father
presented
her
he
in
turn
introduced
her
to
his
guests
and
many
a
glance
of
admiration
was
directed
at
the
gentle
maid
one
young
knight
in
particular
was
so
smitten
with
her
charms
that
he
was
dumb
the
whole
evening
when
elizabeth
retired
to
her
chamber
her
father
bade
her
hope
had
again
arisen
in
his
breast
he
said
troubles
will
be
elizabeth
sighed
at
length
the
hour
of
midnight
arrived
taking
a
lamp
the
girl
crossed
the
courtyard
to
where
the
alchemist
awaited
her
coming
she
was
not
unseen
however
the
young
knight
had
been
watching
her
window
and
he
observed
her
pass
through
the
courtyard
with
surprise
fearing
he
knew
not
what
harm
to
the
maid
he
loved
he
followed
her
to
the
apartment
and
there
watched
her
through
a
crack
in
the
door
the
alchemist
was
bending
over
a
crucible
when
elizabeth
entered
thou
hast
come
he
said
hope
thou
art
prepared
to
do
as
i
bid
thee
if
that
is
so
i
will
restore
the
gold
to
thy
own
gold
and
his
if
thou
art
willing
to
sacrifice
thine
honour
thy
honour
shall
be
restored
if
thy
life
he
shall
have
the
money
he
wretch
cried
elizabeth
indignantly
will
give
my
life
for
my
father
but
i
will
not
suffer
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
alchemist
turned
to
his
crucible
thou
wilt
he
said
for
the
suddenly
the
kneeling
maid
caught
up
the
dagger
and
would
have
plunged
it
into
her
heart
but
ere
she
could
carry
out
her
purpose
the
knight
burst
open
the
door
rushed
into
the
room
and
seized
the
weapon
elizabeth
overcome
with
the
relief
which
his
opportune
arrival
afforded
her
fainted
in
his
arms
while
the
young
man
frantically
sought
means
to
restore
her
the
pilgrim
seized
the
opportunity
to
escape
and
when
the
maid
came
to
herself
it
was
to
find
the
wretch
gone
and
herself
supported
by
a
handsome
young
knight
who
was
pouring
impassioned
speeches
into
her
ear
his
love
and
tenderness
awakened
an
answering
emotion
in
her
heart
and
that
very
night
they
were
betrothed
when
the
father
was
apprised
of
her
recent
peril
he
too
was
grateful
to
her
deliverer
and
yet
more
grateful
when
his
future
pressed
him
to
make
use
of
his
ample
fortune
the
pilgrim
was
found
drowned
in
the
rhine
and
the
bag
of
gold
which
he
had
carried
away
in
his
belt
was
handed
over
to
the
archbishop
to
whom
the
treasurer
confessed
all
and
the
good
archbishop
by
way
of
confirming
his
forgiveness
gave
a
handsome
present
to
elizabeth
on
her
marriage
with
the
knight
the
legend
of
boppard
maidens
had
curious
ways
of
revenging
themselves
on
unfaithful
lovers
in
medieval
times
as
the
following
legend
of
boppard
would
show
toward
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
there
dwelt
in
boppard
a
knight
named
sir
conrad
bayer
brave
generous
and
a
good
comrade
but
not
without
his
faults
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
at
that
time
many
brave
knights
and
nobles
were
fighting
in
the
third
crusade
under
frederick
the
first
and
richard
but
sir
conrad
still
remained
at
boppard
he
gave
out
that
the
reason
for
his
remaining
at
home
was
to
protect
his
stronghold
against
a
horde
of
robbers
who
infested
the
neighbourhood
but
there
were
those
who
ascribed
his
reluctance
to
depart
to
another
cause
in
a
neighbouring
fortress
there
lived
a
beautiful
maiden
maria
by
name
who
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
from
sir
conrad
so
frequent
were
his
visits
to
her
home
that
rumour
had
it
that
the
fair
lady
had
won
his
heart
this
indeed
was
the
case
and
she
in
return
had
given
her
love
unreservedly
into
his
keeping
but
as
her
passion
grew
stronger
his
seemed
to
cool
and
at
length
he
began
to
make
preparations
to
join
the
wars
in
palestine
leaving
the
lady
to
lament
his
changed
demeanour
in
vain
she
pleaded
in
vain
she
sent
letters
to
him
at
last
he
intimated
plainly
that
he
loved
her
no
longer
he
did
not
intend
to
marry
he
said
adding
cruelly
that
if
he
did
she
should
not
be
the
bride
of
his
choice
the
lady
was
completely
crushed
by
the
blow
her
affection
for
sir
conrad
perished
and
in
its
place
arose
a
desire
to
be
revenged
on
the
unfaithful
knight
the
fickle
lover
had
completed
his
arrangements
for
his
journey
to
the
holy
land
and
all
was
ready
for
his
departure
as
he
rode
gaily
down
from
his
castle
to
where
his
waited
on
the
shores
of
the
rhine
he
was
suddenly
confronted
by
an
armed
knight
who
reined
in
his
steed
and
bade
sir
conrad
halt
sir
conrad
bayer
he
cried
goest
not
hence
till
thou
hast
answered
for
thy
false
traitor
sir
conrad
listened
in
astonishment
a
moment
later
his
attendants
had
surrounded
the
bold
youth
and
would
have
slain
him
had
not
sir
conrad
interfered
he
said
me
face
this
braggart
myself
who
art
thou
he
added
addressing
the
young
knight
who
had
thus
boldly
challenged
him
who
would
have
thy
life
was
the
fierce
reply
should
i
slay
thee
bold
youth
said
conrad
amused
am
the
brother
of
maria
whom
thou
hast
betrayed
was
the
response
have
come
hither
from
palestine
to
seek
thy
life
have
at
thee
traitor
conrad
somewhat
sobered
and
unwilling
to
do
battle
with
such
a
boy
asked
for
further
proof
of
his
identity
the
young
knight
thereupon
displayed
blazoned
on
his
shield
the
arms
of
his
golden
lion
on
an
azure
field
sir
conrad
had
no
longer
excuse
for
refusing
to
do
battle
with
the
youth
so
with
a
muttered
blood
be
upon
thy
head
he
laid
his
lance
in
rest
and
drew
back
a
few
paces
the
stranger
did
likewise
then
they
rushed
toward
each
other
and
such
was
the
force
of
their
impact
that
both
were
unhorsed
drawing
their
neither
was
knights
resumed
the
conflict
on
foot
conrad
felt
disgraced
at
having
been
unhorsed
by
a
mere
youth
and
he
was
now
further
incensed
by
receiving
a
deep
wound
in
his
arm
henceforth
he
fought
in
good
earnest
showering
blows
on
his
antagonist
who
fell
at
last
mortally
wounded
in
obedience
to
the
rules
of
chivalry
sir
conrad
hastened
to
assist
his
vanquished
foe
what
was
his
surprise
his
horror
when
on
raising
the
head
and
unlacing
the
helm
of
the
knight
he
found
that
his
adversary
was
none
other
than
maria
she
said
in
failing
tones
also
am
to
blame
without
thy
love
life
was
nothing
to
me
and
i
resolved
to
die
by
thy
hand
forget
my
folly
remember
only
that
i
loved
thee
farewell
and
with
these
words
she
expired
conrad
flung
himself
down
by
her
side
convulsed
with
grief
and
remorse
from
that
hour
a
change
came
over
him
ere
he
set
out
to
the
holy
land
he
caused
the
body
of
maria
to
be
interred
on
the
summit
of
the
kreuzberg
and
bestowed
the
greater
part
of
his
estates
on
a
pious
brotherhood
enjoining
them
to
raise
a
nunnery
over
the
tomb
thus
was
the
convent
of
marienberg
founded
and
in
time
it
came
to
be
one
of
the
richest
and
most
celebrated
on
the
rhine
arrived
in
palestine
conrad
became
a
fighting
bravely
and
utterly
oblivious
to
all
danger
it
was
not
until
acre
had
been
won
however
that
death
met
him
an
arrow
dispatched
by
an
unknown
hand
found
its
quarry
as
he
was
walking
the
ramparts
at
night
meditating
on
the
lady
he
had
slain
and
whose
death
had
restored
her
to
a
place
in
his
affections
liebenstein
and
sterrenberg
near
the
famous
monastery
of
bornhofen
and
not
far
from
the
town
of
camp
supposed
to
be
an
ancient
roman
site
are
the
celebrated
castles
of
liebenstein
and
sterrenberg
called
brothers
perhaps
because
of
their
contiguity
to
each
other
rather
than
through
the
legend
connected
with
the
name
history
is
practically
silent
concerning
these
towers
which
occupy
two
steep
crags
united
by
a
small
isthmus
which
has
partially
been
cut
through
sterrenberg
lies
nearest
the
north
liebenstein
to
the
south
a
wooden
bridge
leads
from
one
to
the
other
but
a
high
wall
called
the
schildmauer
was
in
the
old
days
reared
between
them
obviously
with
the
intention
of
cutting
off
communication
the
legend
has
undoubtedly
become
sophisticated
by
literary
influences
and
was
so
altered
by
one
joseph
kugelgen
as
to
change
its
purport
entirely
it
is
the
modern
version
of
the
legend
we
give
here
in
contradistinction
to
that
given
in
the
chapter
on
the
folklore
and
literature
of
the
rhine
see
pp
et
the
brothers
heinrich
and
conrad
were
the
sons
of
kurt
a
brave
knight
who
had
retired
from
the
wars
and
now
dwelt
in
his
ancestral
castle
liebenstein
the
brothers
were
alike
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
arms
and
chivalry
but
otherwise
they
differed
for
heinrich
the
elder
was
quiet
and
more
given
to
the
arts
of
peace
whereas
conrad
was
gay
and
inclined
to
like
fighting
for
sake
brought
up
along
with
them
was
hildegarde
a
relative
and
an
orphan
whom
the
brothers
believed
to
be
their
sister
on
reaching
manhood
however
their
father
told
them
the
truth
concerning
her
expressing
the
wish
that
one
of
them
should
marry
the
maiden
nothing
loath
both
brothers
wooed
hildegarde
but
ardent
impulsive
nature
triumphed
over
reserved
and
more
steadfast
affection
in
due
course
preparations
were
made
for
the
marriage
festival
and
a
new
castle
sterrenberg
was
raised
for
the
young
couple
adjacent
to
liebenstein
heinrich
found
it
hard
to
be
a
constant
witness
of
his
happiness
so
he
set
out
for
the
holy
land
soon
after
his
departure
the
old
knight
became
ill
and
died
on
the
day
that
the
new
castle
was
completed
this
delayed
the
marriage
for
a
year
and
as
the
months
passed
conrad
became
associated
with
loose
companions
and
his
love
for
hildegarde
weakened
meantime
news
came
that
heinrich
had
performed
marvellous
deeds
in
the
holy
land
and
the
tidings
inflamed
zeal
he
too
determined
to
join
the
crusades
and
was
soon
on
the
way
to
palestine
however
he
did
not
like
his
brother
gain
he
had
not
the
same
incentive
to
reckless
he
soon
returned
he
was
again
to
prove
himself
more
successful
in
love
than
in
war
for
at
constantinople
having
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
a
beautiful
greek
lady
he
married
her
one
day
hildegarde
was
sitting
sorrowful
in
her
chamber
when
she
beheld
travellers
with
baggage
moving
into
the
empty
sterrenberg
greatly
astonished
she
sent
her
to
make
inquiries
and
learned
to
her
sorrow
that
it
was
the
returning
conrad
who
came
bringing
with
him
a
greek
wife
conrad
avoided
liebenstein
and
sterrenberg
became
gay
with
feasting
and
music
late
one
evening
a
knight
demanded
lodging
at
liebenstein
and
was
admitted
the
stranger
was
heinrich
who
hearing
about
his
shameful
marriage
had
returned
to
the
hildegarde
after
he
had
rested
heinrich
sent
a
message
to
his
brother
reproaching
him
with
unknightly
behaviour
and
challenging
him
to
mortal
combat
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
the
combatants
met
on
the
passage
separating
the
two
castles
but
as
they
faced
each
other
sword
in
hand
a
veiled
female
figure
stepped
between
them
and
bade
them
desist
it
was
hildegarde
who
had
recognized
heinrich
and
learned
his
intention
in
impassioned
tones
she
urged
the
young
men
not
to
be
guilty
of
the
folly
of
shedding
each
blood
in
such
a
cause
and
declared
that
it
was
her
firm
intention
to
spend
her
remaining
days
in
a
convent
the
brothers
submitted
themselves
to
her
persuasion
and
became
reconciled
some
time
afterward
wife
proved
her
unworthiness
by
eloping
with
a
young
knight
thus
killing
her
love
for
her
and
at
the
same
time
opening
his
eyes
to
his
own
base
conduct
bitterly
now
did
he
reproach
himself
for
his
unfaithfulness
to
hildegarde
who
alas
was
now
lost
to
him
for
ever
hildegarde
remained
faithful
to
her
vows
and
heinrich
and
conrad
lived
together
till
at
last
death
separated
them
goar
near
the
town
of
goar
at
the
foot
of
the
rheinfels
there
stands
a
little
cell
once
the
habitation
of
a
pious
hermit
known
as
goar
and
many
are
the
local
traditions
which
tell
of
the
miracles
wrought
by
this
good
man
and
the
marvellous
virtues
retained
by
his
shrine
after
his
death
he
settled
on
rhenish
shores
we
are
told
about
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
and
thenceforward
devoted
his
life
to
the
service
of
the
rude
people
among
whom
his
lot
was
cast
his
first
care
was
to
instruct
them
in
the
christian
faith
but
he
was
also
mindful
of
their
welfare
in
temporal
matters
and
gave
his
services
freely
to
the
sick
and
sorrowful
so
that
ere
long
he
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
saint
when
he
was
not
employed
in
prayer
and
ministrations
he
watched
the
currents
of
the
rhine
and
was
ever
willing
to
lend
his
aid
to
distressed
mariners
who
had
been
caught
by
the
sand
gewirr
a
dangerous
eddy
which
was
too
often
the
death
of
unwary
boatmen
in
these
parts
thus
he
spent
an
active
and
cheerful
life
far
from
the
envy
and
strife
of
the
world
for
which
he
had
no
taste
whatever
nevertheless
the
fame
of
his
good
deeds
had
reached
the
high
places
of
the
earth
sigebert
who
at
that
time
held
his
court
at
andernach
heard
of
the
piety
and
noble
life
of
the
hermit
and
invited
him
to
his
palace
goar
accepted
the
rather
obeyed
the
made
his
way
to
andernach
he
was
well
received
by
the
monarch
whom
his
genuine
holiness
and
greatly
impressed
but
pure
as
he
was
the
worthy
goar
was
not
destined
to
escape
calumny
there
were
at
the
court
of
sigebert
other
ecclesiastics
of
a
less
exalted
type
and
these
were
filled
with
envy
and
indignation
when
they
beheld
the
favours
bestowed
upon
the
erstwhile
recluse
foremost
among
his
persecutors
was
the
archbishop
of
treves
and
with
him
sigebert
dealt
in
summary
fashion
depriving
him
of
his
archbishopric
and
offering
the
see
to
goar
the
latter
however
was
sick
of
the
perpetual
intrigues
and
squabblings
of
the
court
and
longed
to
return
to
the
shelter
of
his
mossy
cell
and
the
sincere
friendship
of
the
poor
fishermen
among
whom
his
mission
lay
so
he
refused
the
proffered
dignity
and
informed
the
monarch
of
his
desire
to
return
home
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
of
the
palace
preparing
to
take
his
leave
he
threw
his
cloak
over
a
sunbeam
and
strange
to
say
the
garment
was
suspended
as
though
the
shaft
of
light
were
solid
this
we
are
told
was
not
a
mere
piece
of
bravado
but
was
done
to
show
that
the
action
in
refusing
the
see
was
prompted
by
divine
inspiration
when
goar
died
sigebert
caused
a
chapel
to
be
erected
over
his
grave
choosing
from
among
his
disciples
two
worthy
monks
to
officiate
other
hermits
took
up
their
abode
near
the
spot
and
all
were
subsequently
gathered
together
in
a
monastery
the
grave
of
the
solitary
became
a
favourite
shrine
to
which
pilgrims
travelled
from
all
quarters
and
goar
became
the
patron
saint
of
hospitality
not
so
much
personally
as
through
the
monastery
of
which
he
was
the
patron
and
one
of
whose
rules
was
that
no
stranger
should
be
denied
hospitality
for
a
certain
period
a
goodly
number
of
stories
are
told
of
his
somewhat
drastic
treatment
of
those
who
passed
by
his
shrine
without
bringing
an
which
may
be
traced
to
the
monks
who
dwelt
there
and
who
reaped
the
benefit
of
these
offerings
charlemagne
at
the
shrine
of
goar
here
is
one
of
those
tales
concerning
the
great
karl
on
one
occasion
while
he
was
travelling
from
ingelheim
to
by
way
of
coblentz
he
passed
the
shrine
of
goar
without
so
much
as
a
single
thought
nor
did
those
who
accompanied
him
give
the
saint
more
attention
it
was
the
height
of
summer
everything
was
bright
and
beautiful
and
as
the
flotilla
drifted
lazily
down
the
rhine
the
sound
of
laughter
and
light
jesting
could
be
heard
no
sooner
had
the
emperor
and
his
courtiers
passed
goar
however
than
the
smiling
sky
became
overcast
heavy
clouds
gathered
and
the
distant
sound
of
thunder
was
heard
a
moment
more
and
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
raging
storm
water
surged
and
boiled
all
around
and
darkness
fell
so
thickly
that
scarce
could
one
see
face
panic
reigned
supreme
where
all
had
been
gaiety
and
merriment
in
vain
the
sailors
strove
to
reach
the
shore
in
vain
the
ladies
shrieked
and
the
emperor
and
his
nobles
lent
their
aid
to
the
seamen
all
the
exertions
of
the
sailors
would
not
suffice
to
move
the
vessels
one
foot
nearer
the
shore
at
length
an
old
boatman
who
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
a
lifetime
on
the
rhine
approached
the
emperor
and
addressed
him
thus
our
labours
are
useless
we
have
offended
god
and
the
words
were
repeated
by
the
train
who
now
saw
that
the
storm
was
of
miraculous
origin
us
go
ashore
said
charlemagne
in
an
awed
voice
the
name
of
god
and
goar
let
us
go
ashore
we
will
pray
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
that
he
may
help
us
make
peace
with
scarcely
had
he
uttered
the
words
ere
the
sky
began
to
clear
the
boiling
water
subsided
to
its
former
glassy
smoothness
and
the
storm
was
over
the
illustrious
company
landed
and
sought
the
shrine
of
the
holy
man
where
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
prayer
ere
they
departed
on
the
following
morning
charlemagne
and
his
court
presented
rich
offerings
at
the
shrine
and
the
emperor
afterward
endowed
the
monastery
with
lands
of
great
extent
by
which
means
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
he
succeeded
in
propitiating
the
jealous
saint
the
reconciliation
one
more
tale
of
goar
may
be
added
dealing
this
time
with
sons
pepin
and
karloman
these
two
brave
knights
both
had
had
a
serious
quarrel
over
the
sovereignty
of
their
vast
empire
gradually
the
breach
widened
to
a
deadly
feud
and
the
brothers
once
the
best
of
friends
became
the
bitterest
enemies
in
charlemagne
held
an
imperial
diet
at
thionville
and
thither
he
summoned
his
three
sons
karloman
pepin
and
ludwig
intending
to
divide
the
empire
by
testament
among
them
karloman
was
at
that
time
in
germany
and
pepin
in
italy
where
with
the
aid
of
his
sword
he
had
won
for
himself
broad
lands
in
order
to
reach
thionville
both
were
obliged
to
take
the
same
is
the
rhine
the
broad
waterway
of
their
dominions
pepin
was
the
first
to
come
and
as
he
sailed
up
the
river
with
his
train
he
caught
sight
of
the
shrine
of
goar
and
bethought
him
that
there
he
and
his
brother
had
last
met
as
friends
as
he
pondered
on
the
strange
fate
that
had
made
enemies
of
them
once
so
full
of
kindness
toward
each
other
he
felt
curiously
moved
and
decided
to
put
ashore
and
kneel
by
the
shrine
of
the
saint
ere
long
karloman
and
his
train
moved
up
the
rhine
and
this
prince
also
when
he
beheld
the
shrine
of
goar
was
touched
with
a
feeling
of
tenderness
for
his
absent
brother
recollections
of
the
time
when
pepin
and
he
had
been
inseparable
surged
over
him
and
he
too
stepped
ashore
and
made
his
way
through
the
wood
to
the
sacred
spot
meanwhile
pepin
still
knelt
before
the
shrine
and
great
indeed
was
astonishment
when
he
beheld
his
brother
but
when
he
heard
pepin
pray
aloud
that
they
might
be
reconciled
his
joy
and
surprise
knew
no
bounds
all
armed
as
he
was
he
strode
up
to
his
kneeling
brother
and
embraced
him
with
tears
entreating
his
forgiveness
for
past
harshnesses
when
pepin
raised
the
visor
and
beheld
the
beloved
features
of
karloman
his
happiness
was
complete
together
the
brothers
made
for
their
ships
not
however
till
they
had
left
valuable
gifts
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
whose
good
offices
had
brought
about
their
reconciliation
together
they
proceeded
to
the
court
of
charlemagne
who
partitioned
his
empire
between
his
three
sons
making
each
a
regent
of
his
portion
during
his
lifetime
from
that
time
onward
the
brothers
were
fast
friends
karloman
and
pepin
however
had
not
long
to
live
for
the
former
died
in
and
the
latter
in
the
following
year
gutenfels
a
romance
a
very
charming
story
and
one
entirely
lacking
in
the
element
of
gloom
and
tragedy
which
is
so
marked
a
feature
of
most
rhenish
tales
is
that
which
tradition
assigns
to
the
castle
of
gutenfels
its
ancient
name
of
caub
or
chaube
still
clings
to
the
town
above
which
it
towers
majestically
in
the
thirteenth
century
caub
was
the
habitation
of
sir
philip
of
falkenstein
and
his
sister
guta
the
latter
justly
acclaimed
as
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
germany
she
was
reputed
as
proud
as
she
was
beautiful
and
of
the
many
suitors
who
flocked
to
caub
to
seek
her
hand
in
marriage
none
could
win
from
her
a
word
of
encouragement
or
even
a
tender
glance
on
one
occasion
she
and
her
brother
were
present
at
a
great
tourney
held
at
cologne
where
the
flower
of
knightly
chivalry
and
maidenly
beauty
were
gathered
in
a
brilliant
assembly
many
an
ardent
glance
was
directed
to
the
fair
maid
of
caub
but
she
accustomed
to
such
homage
was
not
moved
thereby
from
her
wonted
composure
at
length
a
commotion
passed
through
the
assembly
a
knight
had
entered
the
lists
whose
name
was
not
announced
by
the
herald
it
was
whispered
that
his
identity
was
known
only
to
the
archbishop
whose
guest
he
was
of
fine
stature
and
handsome
features
clad
in
splendid
armour
and
mounted
on
a
richly
caparisoned
steed
he
attracted
not
a
little
attention
especially
from
the
feminine
portion
of
the
assemblage
but
for
none
of
the
ladies
had
he
eyes
save
for
guta
to
whom
his
glance
was
ever
and
anon
directed
as
though
he
looked
to
her
to
bring
him
victory
the
blushing
looks
of
guta
showed
that
she
was
not
indifferent
to
the
gallantry
of
the
noble
stranger
and
truly
in
her
heart
she
wished
him
well
with
clasped
hands
she
watched
the
combatants
couch
their
lances
and
charge
ah
victory
had
fallen
to
the
unknown
knight
soon
it
became
evident
that
the
mysterious
stranger
was
to
carry
off
the
prize
of
the
tourney
for
there
was
none
to
match
him
in
skill
and
prowess
as
he
rode
past
the
place
where
guta
sat
he
lowered
his
lance
and
she
in
her
pleasure
and
confusion
at
this
mark
of
especial
courtesy
dropped
her
glove
which
the
knight
instantly
picked
up
desiring
to
be
allowed
to
keep
it
as
a
guerdon
at
the
grand
ball
which
followed
the
tourney
the
victor
remained
all
the
evening
at
side
and
would
dance
with
no
other
maiden
young
falkenstein
pleased
with
the
homage
paid
to
his
sister
by
the
distinguished
stranger
invited
him
to
visit
them
at
caub
an
invitation
which
the
gentle
guta
seconded
and
which
the
mysterious
knight
accepted
with
alacrity
true
to
his
promise
ere
a
week
had
elapsed
he
arrived
at
caub
accompanied
by
two
attendants
his
visit
covered
three
days
during
which
time
his
host
and
hostess
did
all
in
their
power
to
make
his
stay
a
pleasant
one
ere
he
took
his
departure
he
sought
out
guta
and
made
known
his
love
the
lady
acknowledged
that
his
affection
was
returned
guta
said
the
knight
may
not
yet
reveal
to
thee
my
name
but
if
thou
wilt
await
my
coming
in
three
months
i
shall
return
to
claim
my
bride
and
thou
shalt
know
will
be
true
to
thee
exclaimed
guta
passionately
a
king
should
woo
me
i
will
be
true
to
and
with
that
assurance
from
his
betrothed
the
knight
rode
away
three
months
came
and
went
and
still
guta
heard
nothing
of
her
absent
lover
she
grew
paler
and
sadder
as
time
advanced
not
because
she
doubted
the
honour
of
her
knight
but
because
she
feared
he
had
been
slain
in
battle
it
was
indeed
a
time
of
wars
and
dissensions
on
the
death
of
conrad
iv
several
claimants
to
the
imperial
throne
of
germany
made
their
appearance
of
whom
the
principal
were
adolph
duke
of
holland
richard
earl
of
cornwall
brother
to
the
english
king
henry
iii
and
alfonso
x
king
of
castile
of
these
three
the
most
popular
was
richard
of
cornwall
who
was
finally
chosen
by
the
electors
more
on
account
of
his
knightly
qualities
than
because
of
his
fabulous
wealth
among
his
most
ardent
followers
was
philip
of
falkenstein
who
was
naturally
much
elated
at
his
success
now
however
the
conflict
was
over
and
philip
had
returned
to
caub
one
morning
about
six
months
after
the
departure
of
lover
a
gay
cavalcade
appeared
at
the
gates
of
caub
and
a
herald
demanded
admission
for
richard
emperor
of
germany
philip
himself
scarcely
concealing
his
joy
and
pride
at
the
honour
done
him
by
his
sovereign
ran
out
to
greet
him
and
the
castle
was
full
of
stir
and
bustle
the
emperor
praised
philip
heartily
for
his
part
in
the
recent
wars
yet
he
seemed
absent
and
uneasy
philip
he
said
at
length
have
come
hither
to
beg
the
hand
of
thy
fair
sister
why
is
she
not
with
us
falkenstein
was
filled
with
amazement
he
stammered
fear
me
thou
wilt
find
my
sister
an
unwilling
bride
she
has
refused
many
nobles
of
high
estate
and
i
doubt
whether
even
a
crown
will
tempt
her
however
i
will
plead
with
her
for

he
left
the
room
to
seek
bower
but
soon
returned
with
dejected
mien
is
as
i
thought
sire
he
said
will
not
be
moved
methinks
some
heedless
knight
hath
stolen
her
heart
for
she
hath
grown
pale
and
drooping
as
a
gathered
richard
raised
his
visor
thou
me
sir
knight
he
said
knight
of
the
tourney
cried
philip
in
amaze

answered
richard
smiling
i
am
the
knight
who
has
won
thy
fair
heart
we
plighted
our
troth
after
the
tourney
of
cologne
state
affairs
of
the
gravest
import
have
kept
me
from
her
side
where
i
would
fain
have
been
these
six
months
past
take
this
from
his
breast
the
glove
guta
had
given
tell
her
that
a
poor
knight
in
train
sends
her
in
a
little
while
philip
returned
with
his
sister
the
maiden
looked
pale
and
agitated
but
when
she
beheld
richard
she
rushed
to
him
and
was
clasped
in
his
arms
own
guta
he
whispered
fondly
wouldst
thou
refuse
an
emperor
to
marry
me
truly
answered
the
maid
hundred
emperors
i
feared
thou
hadst
forsaken
me
altogether
she
added
naively
richard
laughed
i

a
worthy
emperor
an

did
not
keep
my
troth
with
such
as
thou
he
asked
cried
guta
starting
back
the
emperor
and
none
other
said
her
brother
reverently
and
once
more
guta
hid
her
face
on
breast
within
a
week
they
were
married
and
guta
accompanied
her
husband
to
the
court
as
empress
of
germany
to
the
castle
where
his
bride
had
passed
her
maidenhood
richard
gave
the
name
of
of
name
it
has
retained
to
this
day
the
story
of
schönburg
the
castle
of
schönburg
not
far
from
the
town
of
bacharach
is
now
in
ruins
but
was
once
a
place
of
extraordinary
fame
for
here
dwelt
at
one
time
seven
sisters
of
transcendent
beauty
who
were
courted
the
more
assiduously
because
their
father
the
graf
von
schönburg
was
reputed
a
man
of
great
wealth
this
wealth
was
no
myth
but
an
actuality
and
in
truth
it
had
been
mainly
acquired
in
predatory
forays
but
the
nobles
of
rhineland
recked
little
of
this
and
scores
of
them
flitted
around
and
pressed
their
suit
on
the
young
ladies
none
of
these
however
felt
inclined
toward
marriage
just
yet
each
vowing
its
yoke
too
galling
and
so
the
gallants
came
in
vain
to
the
castle
their
respective
addresses
being
invariably
dallied
with
and
then
dismissed
suitor
after
suitor
retired
in
despair
pondering
on
the
strange
ways
of
womankind
but
one
evening
a
large
party
of
noblemen
chanced
to
be
assembled
at
the
schloss
and
putting
their
heads
together
they
decided
to
press
matters
to
a
conclusion
they
agreed
that
all
of
them
in
gorgeous
raiment
should
gather
in
the
of
the
castle
the
seven
sisters
should
be
summoned
and
called
upon
in
peremptory
fashion
to
have
done
with
silken
dalliance
and
to
end
matters
by
selecting
seven
husbands
from
among
them
the
young
ladies
received
the
summons
with
some
amusement
all
of
them
being
blessed
with
the
saving
grace
of
humour
and
they
bade
the
knight
who
had
brought
the
message
return
to
his
fellows
and
tell
them
that
the
suggested
interview
would
be
held
give
us
time
said
the
sisters
the
donning
of
our
most
becoming
so
now
the
band
of
suitors
mustered
and
a
brave
display
they
made
each
of
them
thinking
himself
more
handsome
and
gorgeous
than
his
neighbours
and
boasting
that
he
would
be
among
the
chosen
seven
but
as
time
sped
on
and
the
ladies
still
tarried
the
young
men
began
to
grow
anxious
many
of
them
spoke
aloud
of
female
vanity
and
made
derisive
comments
on
the
coiffing
and
the
like
which
they
imagined
was
the
cause
of
the
delay
eventually
one
of
their
number
tired
of
strutting
before
a
mirror
happened
to
go
to
look
out
of
the
window
toward
the
rhine
suddenly
he
uttered
a
loud
imprecation
and
his
companions
thronging
to
the
window
were
all
fiercely
incensed
at
the
sight
which
greeted
their
eyes
for
the
famous
seven
sisters
were
perpetrating
something
of
a
practical
joke
they
were
leaving
the
castle
in
a
boat
and
on
perceiving
the
faces
at
the
windows
they
gave
vent
to
a
loud
laugh
of
disdain
hardly
had
the
angry
suitors
realized
that
they
were
the
butt
of
the
ridicule
when
they
were
seized
with
consternation
for
one
of
the
sisters
in
the
attempt
to
shake
her
fist
at
the
men
she
affected
to
despise
tried
to
stand
up
on
one
of
the
thwarts
of
the
boat
which
being
a
light
craft
was
upset
at
once
the
taunts
were
now
changed
to
loud
cries
for
help
none
being
able
to
swim
but
ere
another
boat
could
be
launched
the
rhine
had
claimed
its
prey
and
the
perfidious
damsels
were
drowned
in
the
swift
tide
but
their
memory
was
not
destined
to
be
erased
from
the
traditions
of
the
locality
near
the
place
where
the
tragedy
occurred
there
are
seven
rocks
visible
only
on
rare
occasions
when
the
river
is
very
low
and
till
lately
it
was
a
popular
superstition
that
these
rocks
were
placed
there
by
providence
anxious
to
impart
a
moral
to
young
women
addicted
to
coquetry
and
practical
jests
to
this
day
many
boatmen
on
the
rhine
regard
these
rocks
with
awe
and
it
is
told
that
now
and
then
seven
wraiths
are
to
be
seen
there
it
is
even
asserted
that
sometimes
these
apparitions
sing
in
strains
as
delectable
as
those
of
the
lorelei
herself
the
legend
of
pfalz
musing
on
the
legendary
lore
of
the
rhine
we
can
not
but
be
struck
by
the
sadness
pervading
these
stories
and
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
every
one
of
them
culminates
in
tragedy
but
there
are
a
few
exceptions
to
this
rule
and
among
them
is
a
tale
associated
with
the
island
of
pfalz
near
bacharach
which
concludes
in
fairly
happy
fashion
if
in
the
main
concerned
with
suffering
this
island
of
pfalz
still
contains
the
ruins
of
a
castle
known
as
pfalzgrafenstein
it
belonged
in
medieval
days
to
the
palatine
princes
and
at
the
time
our
story
opens
one
of
these
named
hermann
having
suspected
his
wife
the
princess
guba
of
infidelity
had
lately
caused
her
to
be
incarcerated
within
it
its
governor
count
von
roth
was
charged
to
watch
the
movements
carefully
but
being
sure
she
was
innocent
his
measures
with
her
were
generally
lenient
while
his
countess
soon
formed
a
deep
friendship
for
the
princess
thus
it
seemed
to
guba
that
her
captivity
was
not
destined
to
be
so
terrible
as
she
had
anticipated
but
she
was
soon
disillusioned
as
will
appear
presently
it
should
be
explained
that
as
yet
the
princess
had
borne
no
children
to
her
husband
whose
was
consequently
his
brother
ludwig
and
this
person
naturally
tried
to
prevent
a
reconciliation
between
the
palatine
prince
and
his
wife
for
should
they
be
united
again
hope
to
succeed
his
brother
might
be
frustrated
so
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
pfalzgrafenstein
constantly
telling
von
roth
that
he
allowed
the
princess
too
much
liberty
worse
still
ludwig
sometimes
remained
at
the
island
castle
for
a
long
time
and
at
these
periods
the
prisoner
underwent
constant
which
the
governor
was
powerless
to
alleviate
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
felt
kindly
toward
guba
but
their
sympathy
was
of
little
avail
and
at
length
during
one
of
visits
to
pfalzgrafenstein
it
seemed
as
though
he
was
about
to
triumph
and
effect
a
final
separation
between
the
princess
and
hermann
for
it
transpired
one
evening
that
guba
was
not
within
the
castle
a
hue
and
cry
was
instantly
raised
and
the
island
was
searched
by
ludwig
and
von
roth
wager
said
ludwig
at
this
very
moment
guba
is
with
her
paramour
let
my
brother
the
prince
hear
of
this
and
your
life
will
answer
for
it
often
have
i
urged
you
to
be
stricter
you
see
now
the
result
of
your
von
roth
protested
that
the
princess
was
taking
the
air
alone
but
while
they
argued
the
pair
espied
guba
and
it
was
as
ludwig
had
was
attended
by
a
man
bird
is
snared
shouted
ludwig
and
as
he
and
von
roth
ran
toward
the
offending
couple
they
separated
instantly
the
man
making
for
a
boat
moored
hard
by
but
ere
he
could
reach
it
he
was
caught
by
his
pursuers
and
recognized
for
a
certain
young
gallant
of
the
district
he
was
dragged
to
the
castle
where
after
a
brief
trial
he
was
condemned
to
be
hanged
he
blanched
on
hearing
the
sentence
but
faced
his
fate
manfully
and
when
the
rope
was
about
his
neck
he
declared
loudly
that
guba
had
always
discouraged
his
addresses
and
was
innocent
of
the
sin
wherewith
she
was
charged
movements
thenceforth
were
watched
more
strictly
for
a
while
yet
she
seemed
to
grow
more
cheerful
while
one
day
she
even
asserted
that
she
would
soon
be
reconciled
to
her
husband
from
whom
she
had
now
been
estranged
for
six
months
in
short
she
announced
that
she
was
soon
to
be
a
mother
while
she
was
confident
that
the
child
would
resemble
the
palatine
prince
and
that
the
delight
on
finding
himself
a
father
would
result
in
the
ending
of
all
her
troubles
the
governor
and
his
lady
were
both
doubtful
as
to
the
parentage
of
the
child
remembering
the
recent
circumstances
which
had
seemed
to
cast
some
shadow
upon
the
princess
herself
yet
they
held
their
peace
awaiting
until
in
due
course
the
princess
was
delivered
of
a
boy
but
alack
the
child
bore
no
resemblance
to
hermann
and
so
von
roth
and
his
wife
meaning
to
be
kind
enjoined
silence
and
sent
the
child
of
which
was
the
more
easily
accomplished
as
the
spiteful
ludwig
chanced
to
be
far
distant
at
the
time
at
first
the
mother
was
but
the
governor
and
his
wife
comforted
her
by
saying
that
the
child
was
no
farther
off
than
a
castle
on
the
opposite
banks
of
the
rhine
here
they
assured
her
he
would
be
well
nurtured
moreover
they
had
arranged
that
so
long
as
her
son
was
alive
and
thriving
the
fact
was
to
be
signified
to
her
by
the
display
of
a
small
white
flag
on
the
battlements
of
his
lodging
and
so
day
after
day
the
anxious
mother
paced
her
island
prison
looking
constantly
toward
the
signal
which
meant
so
much
to
her
many
years
went
by
in
this
fashion
and
in
course
of
time
hermann
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
ludwig
ascended
the
palatine
throne
but
scarcely
was
his
rule
begun
ere
it
was
noised
abroad
that
he
was
a
usurper
for
a
young
man
appeared
who
claimed
to
be
the
son
of
hermann
and
therefore
the
rightful
heir
now
most
of
the
people
detested
ludwig
and
when
they
marked
the
resemblance
to
the
deceased
prince
a
number
of
them
banded
themselves
together
to
set
him
upon
the
throne
a
fierce
civil
war
ensued
many
of
the
nobles
forsaking
ludwig
for
his
rival
who
like
the
late
prince
bore
the
name
of
hermann
and
though
at
first
it
seemed
doubtful
which
party
was
to
triumph
eventually
ludwig
was
worsted
and
was
hanged
for
his
perfidy
the
tidings
spread
throughout
the
rhineland
and
one
day
a
body
of
came
to
pfalzgrafenstein
and
informed
von
roth
that
his
prisoner
was
to
be
freed
at
once
and
was
to
repair
to
the
palatine
court
there
to
take
up
her
rightful
position
as
guba
was
amazed
on
hearing
this
news
for
she
had
long
since
ceased
to
hope
that
her
present
mode
of
life
would
be
altered
and
asking
to
be
presented
to
the
chief
messenger
that
she
might
question
him
she
suddenly
experienced
a
yet
greater
surprise
yes
her
son
had
come
in
person
to
liberate
her
and
von
roth
and
his
wife
as
they
witnessed
the
glad
union
were
convinced
at
last
of
innocence
for
the
young
man
who
clasped
her
to
his
bosom
had
changed
wondrously
since
his
childhood
and
was
now
indeed
the
living
image
of
his
father
for
some
minutes
the
mother
wept
with
joy
but
when
her
son
bade
her
make
ready
for
instant
departure
she
replied
that
she
had
lost
all
desire
for
the
stately
life
of
a
court
pfalzgrafenstein
she
declared
had
become
truly
a
part
of
her
life
so
here
she
would
end
her
days
she
had
not
long
to
live
she
added
and
what
greater
pleasure
could
she
have
than
the
knowledge
that
her
son
was
alive
and
well
and
was
ruling
his
people
wisely
and
so
guba
remained
at
the
island
a
prison
no
longer
and
daily
she
paced
by
the
swirling
stream
often
gazing
toward
the
castle
where
her
son
had
been
nurtured
and
meditating
on
the
time
when
she
was
wont
to
look
there
for
the
white
flag
which
meant
so
much
to
her
anxious
heart
a
legend
of
fürstenberg
high
above
the
rhine
tower
the
ruins
of
fürstenberg
and
more
than
one
legend
clings
to
the
ancient
pile
linking
it
with
stirring
medieval
times
perhaps
the
most
popular
of
these
traditions
is
that
which
tells
of
the
phantom
mother
of
fürstenberg
a
tale
full
of
pathos
and
tragedy
in
the
thirteenth
century
there
dwelt
in
the
castle
a
nobleman
franz
von
fürst
by
name
who
after
a
wild
and
licentious
youth
settled
down
to
a
more
sober
and
serious
manhood
his
friends
surprised
at
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
him
and
anxious
that
this
new
mode
of
life
should
be
maintained
urged
him
to
take
a
virtuous
maiden
to
wife
such
a
bride
as
they
desired
for
him
was
found
in
kunigunda
von
flörsheim
a
maiden
who
was
as
beautiful
as
she
was
for
a
time
after
their
marriage
all
went
well
and
franz
and
his
young
wife
seemed
quite
happy
moreover
in
time
a
son
was
born
to
them
of
whom
his
father
seemed
to
be
very
proud
the
reformation
said
his
friends
was
complete
one
evening
there
came
to
kunigunda
a
young
lady
friend
the
girl
whose
name
was
amina
was
the
daughter
of
a
who
dwelt
in
a
neighbouring
castle
but
his
predatory
acts
had
at
last
forced
him
to
flee
for
his
life
and
no
one
knew
whither
he
had
gone
his
household
was
broken
up
and
amina
finding
herself
without
a
home
had
now
repaired
to
fürstenberg
to
seek
refuge
kunigunda
ever
willing
to
aid
those
in
distress
extended
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
damsel
and
amina
was
henceforth
an
inmate
of
the
schloss
now
though
amina
was
fully
as
lovely
in
face
and
form
as
her
young
hostess
she
yet
lacked
the
moral
beauty
of
kunigunda
of
a
subtle
and
crafty
disposition
she
showed
the
gratitude
of
the
serpent
by
stinging
the
hand
extended
to
help
her
in
a
word
she
set
herself
to
win
the
unlawful
affections
of
the
lord
of
fürstenberg
he
weak
creature
as
he
was
allowed
the
latent
baseness
of
his
nature
to
be
stirred
by
her
youth
and
beauty
he
listened
when
she
whispered
that
kunigunda
had
grown
cold
toward
him
at
her
suggestion
he
interpreted
his
modest
demeanour
as
indifference
and
already
he
began
to
feel
the
yoke
of
matrimony
heavy
upon
him
poor
kunigunda
was
in
despair
when
she
realized
that
her
husband
had
transferred
his
affections
but
what
was
worse
she
learned
that
the
pair
were
plotting
against
her
life
at
length
their
cruel
scheming
succeeded
and
one
morning
kunigunda
was
found
dead
in
her
bed
franz
made
it
known
that
she
had
been
stifled
by
a
fit
of
coughing
and
her
remains
were
hastily
conveyed
to
the
family
vault
within
a
week
the
false
amina
was
the
bride
of
the
baron
von
fürstenberg
little
hugo
the
son
of
kunigunda
was
to
suffer
much
at
the
hands
of
his
stepmother
and
her
dependents
the
new
mistress
of
the
schloss
fürstenberg
hated
the
child
as
she
had
hated
his
mother
and
hugo
was
given
into
the
charge
of
an
old
nurse
who
frequently
beat
him
in
the
night
because
he
awakened
her
with
his
cries
one
night
the
old
hag
was
roused
from
her
sleep
by
a
strange
sound
the
sound
of
a
cradle
being
rocked
she
imagined
herself
dreaming
who
would
come
to
this
distant
tower
to
rock
the
little
hugo
not
amina
of
that
she
was
sure
again
the
sound
was
heard
unmistakably
the
creaking
of
the
cradle
drawing
aside
her
the
crone
beheld
a
strange
sight
over
the
cradle
a
woman
was
bending
clad
in
long
white
garments
and
singing
a
low
lullaby
and
as
she
raised
her
pale
face
behold
it
was
that
of
the
dead
kunigunda
the
nurse
could
neither
shriek
nor
faint
as
though
fascinated
she
watched
the
wraith
nursing
her
child
until
at
cockcrow
kunigunda
vanished
in
trembling
tones
the
nurse
related
what
she
had
seen
to
franz
and
amina
the
baron
was
scornful
and
ridiculed
the
whole
affair
as
a
dream
but
the
cunning
amina
though
she
did
not
believe
that
a
ghost
had
visited
the
child
thought
that
perhaps
her
rival
was
not
really
dead
and
her
old
hatred
and
jealousy
were
reawakened
so
she
told
her
husband
that
she
intended
to
see
for
herself
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
the
fantastic
story
and
would
sleep
that
night
in
the
bed
she
did
not
mention
her
suspicions
nor
the
fact
that
she
carried
a
sharp
dagger
she
was
roused
in
the
night
as
the
old
woman
had
been
by
the
sound
of
a
cradle
being
rocked
stealthily
drawing
the
curtains
she
saw
the
form
of
the
dead
the
black
mould
clinging
to
her
hair
the
hue
of
death
in
her
face
with
a
wild
cry
amina
flung
herself
upon
kunigunda
only
to
find
that
she
was
stabbing
at
a
thing
of
air
an
impalpable
apparition
which
vanished
at
a
touch
overcome
with
rage
and
fear
she
sank
to
the
ground
the
wraith
moved
to
the
door
turning
with
a
warning
gesture
ere
she
vanished
from
sight
and
amina
lost
consciousness
in
the
morning
the
baron
sought
his
wife
in
vain
he
found
instead
a
missive
telling
of
her
ghastly
experience
intimating
her
intention
of
retiring
to
a
nunnery
and
closing
with
an
earnest
appeal
to
her
husband
to
repent
of
his
crimes
the
baron
moved
with
remorse
and
terror
followed
example
he
sought
in
the
mountain
solitudes
a
hermitage
where
he
might
end
his
days
in
peace
and
having
found
such
a
cell
he
confided
his
little
son
to
the
care
of
the
pastor
of
wedenschied
and
retired
from
the
world
in
which
he
had
played
so
sorry
a
part
the
blind
archer
another
legend
connected
with
the
ruined
stronghold
of
fürstenberg
is
the
following
long
ago
in
the
days
when
bitter
feuds
and
rivalries
existed
between
the
owners
of
neighbouring
fortresses
there
dwelt
in
fürstenberg
a
good
old
knight
sir
oswald
by
name
well
versed
in
the
arts
of
war
and
particularly
proficient
in
archery
he
had
one
son
edwin
a
handsome
young
man
who
bade
fair
to
equal
his
father
in
skill
and
renown
sir
oswald
had
a
sworn
foe
in
a
neighbouring
baron
wilm
von
sooneck
a
rich
unscrupulous
nobleman
who
sought
by
every
possible
means
to
get
the
knight
into
his
power
at
length
his
cunning
schemes
met
with
success
an
ambush
was
laid
for
the
unsuspecting
oswald
as
he
rode
past
sooneck
castle
attended
only
by
a
groom
and
both
he
and
his
servant
were
flung
into
a
tower
there
to
await
the
pleasure
of
their
captor
and
what
that
pleasure
was
soon
became
evident
ere
many
days
had
elapsed
oswald
was
informed
that
his
eyes
were
to
be
put
out
and
soon
the
cruel
decree
was
carried
into
execution
meanwhile
edwin
awaited
the
coming
of
his
father
and
when
he
came
not
it
was
at
first
concluded
that
he
had
been
captured
or
slain
by
robbers
but
there
were
no
evidences
forthcoming
to
show
that
sir
oswald
had
met
with
such
a
fate
and
his
son
began
to
suspect
that
his
father
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
baron
wilm
for
he
knew
of
the
bitter
hatred
which
he
bore
toward
the
knight
of
fürstenberg
and
of
his
cunning
and
malice
he
therefore
cast
about
for
a
means
of
verifying
his
suspicions
and
eventually
disguised
himself
as
a
wandering
minstrel
took
his
he
had
great
skill
as
a
set
off
in
the
direction
of
sooneck
there
he
seated
himself
under
a
tree
and
played
and
sang
sweetly
directing
his
gaze
the
while
toward
a
strong
tower
which
seemed
to
him
a
likely
place
for
the
incarceration
of
prisoners
the
plaintive
charm
of
the
melody
attracted
the
attention
of
a
passing
peasant
who
drew
near
to
listen
when
the
last
note
of
the
song
had
died
away
he
seated
himself
beside
the
minstrel
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
thou
hast
an
interest
in
yonder
tower
he
said
truth
it
interests
me
responded
edwin
nevertheless
veiling
his
concern
as
much
as
possible
by
a
seeming
indifference
it
a
prison
think
you
that
it
is
replied
the
peasant
with
a
laugh
the
cage
where
my
lord
of
sooneck
keeps
the
birds
whose
feathers
he
has
edwin
still
with
a
show
of
indifference
questioned
him
further
and
elicited
the
fact
that
the
peasant
had
witnessed
the
capture
and
incarceration
in
the
tower
of
a
knight
and
his
servant
on
the
very
day
when
sir
oswald
and
his
groom
had
disappeared
nothing
more
could
edwin
glean
save
that
a
few
days
hence
baron
wilm
was
to
give
a
grand
banquet
when
many
nobles
and
knights
were
to
be
present
the
young
man
his
suspicions
thus
fully
confirmed
felt
that
his
next
move
must
be
to
gain
entrance
to
the
castle
and
he
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
excitement
and
bustle
attendant
on
the
banquet
to
achieve
this
end
accordingly
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
feast
he
again
donned
his
garb
and
repaired
to
the
schloss
sooneck
here
as
he
had
anticipated
all
was
excitement
and
gaiety
wine
flowed
freely
tongues
were
loosened
and
the
minstrel
was
welcomed
uproariously
and
bidden
to
sing
his
best
songs
in
return
for
a
beaker
of
rhenish
soon
the
greater
part
of
the
company
were
tipsy
and
edwin
moved
among
them
noting
their
conversation
coming
at
length
to
the
seat
of
the
host
is
said
remarked
a
knight
you
have
captured
sir
oswald
of
wilm
to
whom
the
remark
was
addressed
smiled
knowingly
and
did
not
deny
the
charge
have
even
heard
pursued
his
companion
you
have
had
his
eyes
put
the
baron
laughed
outright
as
at
an
excellent
jest
you
have
heard
truly
he
said
at
this
point
another
knight
broke
into
the
conversation
is
a
pity
said
he
are
but
few
archers
to
match
oswald
of
wager
he
can
still
hit
a
mark
if
it
be
set
up
said
he
who
had
first
spoken
cried
sooneck
and
when
the
terms
of
the
wager
had
been
fixed
the
baron
directed
that
oswald
should
be
brought
from
the
tower
edwin
had
overheard
the
conversation
with
a
breaking
heart
and
grief
and
shame
almost
overwhelmed
him
when
he
saw
his
father
pitifully
quiet
and
dignified
led
into
the
to
provide
sport
for
a
company
of
drunken
revellers
oswald
was
informed
of
the
wager
and
bow
and
arrows
were
placed
in
his
hands
von
sooneck
he
cried
is
the
mark
cup
i
place
upon
the
table
came
the
reply
the
arrow
was
fitted
to
the
bow
released
and
lo
it
was
not
the
cup
which
was
hit
but
the
lord
of
sooneck
who
fell
forward
heavily
struck
to
the
heart
and
mortally
wounded
in
a
moment
a
loud
outcry
was
raised
but
ere
action
could
be
taken
the
minstrel
had
sprung
in
front
of
oswald
and
boldly
faced
the
assembly
knight
he
cried
maltreated
by
yonder
villain
is
my
father
whoso
thinks
he
has
acted
wrongly
in
forfeiting
the
life
of
his
torturer
shall
answer
to
me
with
my
sword
i
shall
teach
him
better
the
astonished
knights
completely
sobered
by
the
tragic
occurrence
could
not
but
admire
the
courage
of
the
lad
who
thus
boldly
championed
his
father
and
with
one
voice
they
declared
that
sir
oswald
was
a
true
knight
and
had
done
justly
so
the
blind
knight
once
more
free
returned
to
his
castle
of
fürstenberg
compensated
in
part
for
the
loss
of
his
sight
by
the
loving
devotion
of
his
son
rheinstein
and
reichenstein
centuries
ago
the
castles
of
rheinstein
and
reichenstein
frowned
at
each
other
from
neighbouring
eminences
but
far
from
being
hostile
they
were
the
residences
of
two
lovers
kuno
of
reichenstein
loved
the
fair
gerda
of
rheinstein
with
a
consuming
passion
and
as
is
so
common
with
lovers
in
all
ages
doubted
whether
his
love
were
returned
in
his
devotion
for
the
maiden
he
showered
on
her
many
gifts
and
although
his
purse
was
light
and
he
was
master
of
only
a
single
tower
he
did
not
spare
his
gold
if
only
he
could
make
her
happy
and
gain
from
her
one
look
of
approval
on
one
occasion
he
presented
to
her
a
beauteous
horse
of
the
limousin
strain
bred
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
castle
with
arched
neck
and
eye
of
fire
the
noble
steed
aroused
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
breast
of
gerda
and
she
was
eloquent
in
her
thanks
to
the
giver
until
observing
his
ardent
glances
her
cheeks
suffused
with
blushes
taking
her
soft
hand
between
his
sunburnt
palms
kuno
poured
into
her
ear
the
story
of
his
love
he
whispered
am
a
poor
man
i
have
nothing
but
my
sword
my
ruined
tower
yonder
and
honour
but
they
are
yours
will
you
take
them
with
my
heart
she
lifted
her
blue
eyes
to
his
full
of
truth
and
trust
will
be
yours
she
murmured
and
none
till
young
kuno
left
rheinstein
that
afternoon
his
heart
beating
high
with
hope
and
happiness
the
blood
coursing
through
his
veins
at
a
gallop
made
him
spur
his
charger
to
a
like
pace
but
though
he
rode
fast
his
brain
was
as
busy
as
his
hand
and
his
heart
he
must
in
conformity
with
rhenish
custom
send
as
an
embassy
to
father
one
of
his
most
distinguished
relations
to
whom
was
he
to
turn
there
was
no
one
but
old
kurt
his
wealthy
uncle
whom
he
could
send
as
an
emissary
and
although
the
old
man
had
an
unsavoury
reputation
he
decided
to
confide
the
mission
to
him
kurt
undertook
the
task
in
no
kindly
spirit
for
he
disliked
kuno
because
of
his
virtuous
life
and
the
circumstance
that
he
was
his
heir
whom
he
felt
was
waiting
to
step
into
his
shoes
however
he
waited
next
day
upon
father
the
lord
of
rheinstein
and
was
received
with
all
the
dignity
suitable
to
his
rank
and
age
but
when
his
glance
rested
upon
the
fair
and
innocent
gerda
such
a
fierce
desire
to
make
her
his
arose
in
his
withered
breast
that
when
she
had
withdrawn
he
demanded
her
hand
for
himself
to
her
father
he
drew
an
alluring
picture
of
his
rank
his
possessions
his
castles
his
gold
until
the
old
man
with
whom
avarice
was
a
passion
gave
a
hearty
consent
to
his
suit
and
dismissed
him
with
the
assurance
that
gerda
would
be
his
within
the
week
the
clatter
of
hoofs
had
hardly
died
away
when
the
lord
of
rheinstein
sought
his
bower
where
she
sat
dreaming
of
kuno
in
honeyed
words
the
old
man
described
the
enviable
position
she
would
occupy
as
the
spouse
of
a
wealthy
man
and
then
conveyed
to
her
the
information
that
kurt
had
asked
him
for
her
hand
gerda
insulted
at
the
mere
thought
of
becoming
the
bride
of
such
a
man
refused
to
listen
to
the
proposal
even
from
the
lips
of
her
father
and
she
acquainted
him
with
her
love
for
kuno
whom
she
declared
she
had
fully
resolved
to
marry
at
this
avowal
her
father
worked
himself
into
a
furious
passion
and
assured
her
that
she
should
never
be
the
bride
of
such
a
penniless
adventurer
after
further
insulting
the
absent
kuno
and
alluding
in
a
most
offensive
manner
to
his
lack
of
discernment
and
good
taste
he
quitted
her
bower
assuring
her
as
he
went
that
she
should
become
the
bride
of
kurt
on
the
morrow
gerda
spent
a
miserable
night
sitting
by
the
dying
fire
in
her
chamber
planning
how
she
might
escape
from
the
detested
kurt
until
at
last
her
wearied
brain
refused
to
work
and
she
fell
into
a
troubled
slumber
in
the
morning
she
was
awakened
by
her
handmaiden
who
greatly
concerned
for
her
mistress
had
spent
the
night
in
prayer
but
tears
had
fled
with
the
morning
and
she
resolved
come
what
might
to
refuse
to
the
last
to
wed
with
the
hateful
kurt
she
learned
that
kuno
had
attempted
to
assault
the
castle
during
the
night
with
the
object
of
carrying
her
off
but
that
he
had
been
repulsed
with
some
loss
to
his
small
force
this
made
her
only
the
more
determined
to
persist
in
her
resistance
to
his
uncle
meantime
the
vassals
and
retainers
of
the
house
of
rheinstein
had
been
summoned
to
the
castle
to
attend
the
approaching
ceremony
and
their
gay
apparel
now
shone
and
glittered
in
the
sunshine
the
sound
of
pipe
tabour
and
psaltery
in
melodious
combination
arose
from
the
valley
and
all
hearts
save
one
were
happy
the
gates
were
thrown
open
and
the
bridal
procession
formed
up
to
proceed
to
the
ancient
church
where
the
unhappy
gerda
was
to
be
sacrificed
to
kurt
first
came
a
crowd
of
serfs
men
women
and
children
all
shouting
in
joyful
anticipation
of
the
wedding
feast
then
followed
the
vassals
and
retainers
of
the
lord
of
rheinstein
according
to
their
several
degrees
and
last
the
principal
actors
in
the
shameful
ceremony
kurt
surrounded
by
his
retainers
and
the
lord
of
rheinstein
with
the
luckless
gerda
the
mellow
tones
of
the
bell
of
clement
mingled
sweetly
with
the
sound
of
the
flute
and
the
pipe
and
the
merry
voices
of
the
wedding
throng
gerda
mounted
upon
her
spirited
limousin
steed
the
gift
of
kuno
shuddered
as
she
felt
eyes
resting
upon
her
and
she
cast
a
despairing
glance
at
the
tower
of
castle
where
disconsolate
and
heavy
of
heart
he
watched
the
bridal
procession
from
the
highest
turret
the
procession
halted
at
the
portal
of
the
church
and
all
dismounted
save
gerda
she
was
approached
by
the
bridegroom
who
with
an
air
of
leering
gallantry
offered
her
his
assistance
in
alighting
at
this
moment
swarms
of
gadflies
rested
on
the
flanks
of
the
limousin
steed
and
the
spirited
beast
stung
to
madness
by
the
flies
reared
plunged
and
broke
away
in
a
gallop
scattering
the
spectators
to
right
and
left
and
flying
like
the
wind
along
the
horse
to
horse
cried
kurt
and
the
lord
of
rheinstein
and
speedily
as
many
mounted
the
bridegroom
for
all
his
age
was
first
in
the
saddle
with
the
clattering
of
a
hundred
hoofs
the
wedding
party
galloped
madly
along
rhineside
kurt
leading
on
a
fleet
and
powerful
charger
he
cried
rein
but
notwithstanding
their
shouts
cries
and
entreaties
gerda
spurred
on
the
already
maddened
limousin
which
thundered
along
the
familiar
road
to
castle
of
reichenstein
the
noble
direction
was
quickly
espied
by
kuno
who
hastened
to
the
principal
entrance
of
his
stronghold
open
the
gates
he
shouted
with
the
drawbridge
bravo
gallant
steed
but
kurt
was
close
behind
gerda
could
feel
the
breath
of
his
charger
on
the
hands
which
held
her
rein
close
he
rode
by
her
but
might
never
snatch
her
from
the
saddle
like
the
wind
they
sped
now
she
was
a
pace
in
front
now
they
careered
onward
neck
and
neck
suddenly
he
leaned
over
to
seize
her
rein
but
at
that
instant
his
horse
stumbled
fell
and
threw
the
ancient
gallant
heavily
down
he
came
on
a
great
boulder
and
lay
motionless
another
moment
and
the
of
the
breathless
steed
sounded
on
the
drawbridge
of
reichenstein
the
vassals
of
kuno
hastened
to
the
gate
to
resist
the
expected
attack
but
there
was
none
for
the
wretched
kurt
lay
dead
killed
by
the
fall
and
his
vassals
were
now
eager
to
acclaim
kuno
as
their
lord
while
the
lord
of
rheinstein
shrewdly
observing
the
direction
of
affairs
took
advantage
of
the
tumultuous
moment
to
make
his
peace
with
kuno
the
lovers
were
wedded
next
day
amid
the
acclamations
of
their
friends
and
retainers
and
kuno
and
gerda
dwelt
in
rheinstein
for
many
a
year
loving
and
beloved
chapter
to
auerbach
the
legend
of
falkenburg
in
the
imperial
fortress
of
falkenburg
dwelt
the
beautiful
liba
the
most
charming
and
accomplished
of
maidens
with
her
widowed
mother
many
were
the
suitors
who
climbed
the
hill
to
falkenburg
to
seek
the
hand
of
liba
for
besides
being
beautiful
she
was
gentle
and
virtuous
and
withal
possessed
of
a
modest
fortune
left
her
by
her
father
but
to
all
their
pleadings
she
turned
a
deaf
ear
for
she
was
already
betrothed
to
a
young
knight
named
guntram
whom
she
had
known
since
childhood
and
they
only
waited
until
guntram
should
have
received
his
fief
from
the
palsgrave
to
marry
and
settle
down
one
may
morning
while
liba
was
seated
at
a
window
of
the
castle
watching
the
ships
pass
to
and
fro
on
the
glassy
bosom
of
the
rhine
she
beheld
guntram
riding
up
the
approach
to
falkenburg
and
hastened
to
meet
him
the
gallant
knight
informed
his
betrothed
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
palsgrave
to
receive
his
fief
and
had
but
turned
aside
in
his
journey
in
order
to
greet
his
beloved
she
led
him
into
the
castle
where
her
mother
received
him
graciously
enough
well
pleased
at
her
choice
now
farewell
said
guntram
must
hasten
when
i
return
we
two
shall
wed
see
to
it
that
all
is
in
with
that
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
of
the
courtyard
turning
to
wave
a
gay
farewell
to
liba
the
maiden
watched
him
disappear
round
a
turn
in
the
winding
path
then
slowly
the
castle
meanwhile
guntram
went
on
his
way
and
was
at
length
invested
with
his
fief
the
palsgrave
pleased
with
the
manners
and
appearance
of
the
young
knight
appointed
him
to
be
his
ambassador
in
burgundy
which
honour
guntram
though
with
much
reluctance
felt
it
necessary
to
accept
he
dispatched
a
messenger
to
his
faithful
liba
informing
her
of
his
appointment
which
admitted
of
no
delay
and
regretting
the
consequent
postponement
of
their
marriage
she
indeed
was
with
the
tidings
and
felt
instinctively
that
some
calamity
was
about
to
befall
after
a
time
her
foreboding
affected
her
health
and
spirits
her
former
pursuits
and
pleasures
were
neglected
and
day
after
day
she
sat
listlessly
at
her
casement
awaiting
the
return
of
her
lover
guntram
having
successfully
achieved
his
mission
set
out
on
the
homeward
journey
on
the
way
he
had
to
pass
through
a
forest
and
having
taken
a
wrong
path
lost
his
way
he
wandered
on
without
meeting
a
living
creature
and
came
at
last
to
an
old
dilapidated
castle
into
the
courtyard
of
which
he
entered
thankful
to
have
reached
a
human
habitation
he
gave
his
horse
to
a
staring
boy
who
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
ghost
is
your
master
queried
guntram
the
boy
indicated
an
tower
to
which
the
knight
made
his
way
the
whole
place
struck
him
as
strangely
sombre
and
weird
a
castle
of
shadows
and
vague
horror
he
was
shown
into
a
gloomy
chamber
by
an
aged
attendant
and
there
awaited
the
coming
of
the
lord
opposite
him
was
hung
a
veiled
picture
and
half
hoping
that
he
might
solve
the
mystery
which
pervaded
the
place
he
drew
aside
the
curtain
from
the
canvas
there
looked
out
at
him
a
lady
of
surpassing
beauty
and
the
young
knight
started
back
in
awe
and
admiration
in
a
short
time
the
attendant
returned
with
a
thin
tall
old
man
the
lord
of
the
castle
who
welcomed
the
guest
with
grave
courtesy
and
offered
the
hospitality
of
his
castle
guntram
gratefully
accepted
his
invitation
and
when
he
had
supped
he
conversed
with
the
old
man
whom
he
found
and
cultured
appear
to
be
fond
of
music
said
the
knight
indicating
a
harp
which
lay
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
had
observed
however
that
the
strings
of
the
harp
were
broken
and
that
the
instrument
seemed
to
have
been
long
out
of
use
and
thought
that
it
possibly
had
some
connexion
with
the
original
of
the
veiled
portrait
whatever
recollections
his
remark
aroused
must
have
been
painful
indeed
for
the
host
sighed
heavily
has
long
been
silent
he
said
happiness
has
fled
with
its
music
good
night
and
sleep
and
ere
the
astonished
guest
could
utter
a
word
the
old
man
abruptly
withdrew
from
the
room
shortly
afterward
the
old
attendant
entered
bearing
profuse
apologies
from
his
master
and
begging
that
the
knight
would
continue
to
accept
his
hospitality
guntram
followed
the
old
man
to
his
chamber
as
they
passed
through
the
adjoining
apartment
he
stopped
before
the
veiled
portrait
me
he
said
is
so
lovely
a
picture
hidden
you
have
seen
it
asked
the
old
keeper
is
my
daughter
when
she
was
alive
she
was
even
more
beautiful
than
her
portrait
but
she
was
a
very
capricious
maid
and
demanded
that
her
lovers
should
perform
impossible
feats
at
last
only
one
of
these
lovers
remained
and
of
him
she
asked
that
he
should
descend
into
the
family
vault
and
bring
her
a
golden
crown
from
the
head
of
one
of
her
ancestors
he
did
as
he
was
bidden
but
his
profanation
was
punished
with
death
a
stone
fell
from
the
roof
and
killed
him
the
young
mother
died
soon
after
cursing
the
foolish
maid
who
herself
died
in
the
following
year
but
ere
she
was
buried
she
disappeared
from
her
coffin
and
was
seen
no
when
the
story
was
ended
they
had
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
in
bidding
him
good
night
the
attendant
counselled
him
to
say
his
paternoster
should
anything
untoward
happen
guntram
wondered
at
his
words
but
at
length
fell
asleep
some
hours
later
he
was
awakened
suddenly
by
the
rustling
of
a
gown
and
the
soft
strains
of
a
harp
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
adjoining
room
the
knight
rose
quietly
and
looked
through
a
chink
in
the
door
when
he
beheld
a
lady
dressed
in
white
and
bending
over
a
harp
of
gold
he
recognized
in
her
the
original
of
the
veiled
portrait
and
saw
that
even
the
lovely
picture
had
done
her
less
than
justice
for
a
moment
he
stood
with
hands
clasped
in
silent
admiration
then
with
a
low
sound
half
cry
half
sob
she
cast
the
harp
from
her
and
sank
down
in
an
attitude
of
utter
despondency
the
knight
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
quite
forgetting
his
paternoster
he
flung
open
the
door
and
knelt
at
her
feet
raising
her
hand
to
his
lips
gradually
she
became
composed
you
love
me
knight
she
said
guntram
swore
that
he
did
with
many
passionate
avowals
and
the
lady
slipped
a
ring
on
his
finger
even
as
he
embraced
her
the
cry
of
a
rang
through
the
night
air
and
the
maiden
became
a
corpse
in
his
arms
overcome
with
terror
he
staggered
through
the
darkness
to
his
room
where
he
sank
down
unconscious
on
coming
to
himself
again
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
the
experience
must
have
been
a
dream
but
the
ring
on
his
hand
assured
him
that
the
vision
was
a
ghastly
reality
he
attempted
to
remove
the
gruesome
token
but
he
found
to
his
horror
that
it
seemed
to
have
grown
to
his
finger
in
the
morning
he
related
his
experience
to
the
attendant
alas
said
the
old
man
three
times
nine
days
you
must
guntram
was
quite
overcome
by
the
horror
of
his
situation
and
seemed
for
a
time
bereft
of
his
senses
then
he
had
his
horse
saddled
and
galloped
as
hard
as
he
was
able
to
falkenburg
liba
greeted
him
solicitously
she
could
see
that
he
was
sorely
troubled
but
forbore
to
question
him
preferring
to
wait
until
he
should
confide
in
her
of
his
own
accord
he
was
anxious
that
their
wedding
should
be
hastened
for
he
thought
that
his
union
with
the
virtuous
liba
might
break
the
dreadful
spell
when
at
length
the
wedding
day
arrived
everything
seemed
propitious
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
the
misfortune
which
threatened
the
bridegroom
the
couple
approached
the
altar
and
the
priest
joined
their
hands
suddenly
guntram
fell
to
the
ground
foaming
and
gasping
and
was
carried
thence
to
his
home
the
faithful
liba
stayed
by
his
side
and
when
he
had
partially
recovered
the
knight
told
her
the
story
of
the
spectre
and
added
that
when
the
priest
had
joined
their
hands
he
had
imagined
that
the
ghost
had
put
her
cold
hand
in
his
liba
attempted
to
soothe
her
repentant
lover
and
sent
for
a
priest
to
finish
the
interrupted
wedding
ceremony
this
concluded
guntram
embraced
his
wife
received
absolution
and
expired
liba
entered
a
convent
and
a
few
years
later
she
herself
passed
away
and
was
buried
by
the
side
of
her
husband
the
mouse
tower
bishop
hatto
is
a
figure
equally
well
known
to
history
and
tradition
though
curiously
enough
receiving
a
much
rougher
handling
from
the
latter
than
the
former
history
relates
that
hatto
was
archbishop
of
mainz
in
the
tenth
century
being
the
second
of
his
name
to
occupy
that
see
as
a
ruler
he
was
firm
zealous
and
upright
if
somewhat
ambitious
and
and
his
term
of
office
was
marked
by
a
civic
peace
not
always
experienced
in
those
times
so
much
for
history
according
to
tradition
hatto
was
a
oppressor
of
the
poor
permitting
nothing
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
attainment
of
his
own
selfish
ends
and
several
wild
legends
exhibit
him
in
a
peculiarly
unfavourable
light
by
far
the
most
popular
of
these
traditions
is
that
which
deals
with
the
mäuseturm
or
tower
situated
on
a
small
island
in
the
rhine
near
bingen
it
has
never
been
quite
decided
whether
the
name
was
bestowed
because
of
the
legend
or
whether
the
legend
arose
on
account
of
the
name
and
it
seems
at
least
probable
that
the
tale
is
of
considerably
later
date
than
the
tenth
century
some
authorities
regard
the
word
mäuseturm
as
a
corruption
of
a
a
probable
but
prosaic
interpretation
much
more
interesting
is
the
name
tower
which
gives
point
to
the
tragic
tale
of
bishop
fate
the
story
can
not
be
better
told
than
in
the
words
of
southey
who
has
immortalized
it
in
the
following
ballad
the
tradition
of
bishop
hatto
the
summer
and
autumn
had
been
so
wet
that
in
winter
the
corn
was
growing
yet
a
piteous
sight
to
see
all
around
the
grain
lie
rotting
on
the
ground
every
day
the
starving
poor
crowded
around
bishop
door
for
he
had
a
plentiful
store
and
all
the
neighbourhood
could
tell
his
granaries
were
furnished
well
at
last
bishop
hatto
appointed
a
day
to
quiet
the
poor
without
delay
he
bade
them
to
his
great
barn
repair
and
they
should
have
food
for
the
winter
there
rejoiced
such
tidings
good
to
hear
the
poor
folk
flocked
from
far
and
near
the
great
barn
was
full
as
it
could
hold
of
women
and
children
and
young
and
old
then
when
he
saw
it
could
hold
no
more
bishop
hatto
he
made
fast
the
door
and
while
for
mercy
on
christ
they
call
he
set
fire
to
the
barn
and
burnt
them
all
faith
an
excellent
bonfire
quoth
he
the
country
is
greatly
obliged
to
me
for
ridding
it
in
these
times
forlorn
of
rats
that
only
consume
the
so
then
to
his
palace
returnèd
he
and
he
sat
down
to
supper
merrily
and
he
slept
that
night
like
an
innocent
man
but
bishop
hatto
never
slept
again
in
the
morning
as
he
the
hall
where
his
picture
hung
against
the
wall
a
sweat
like
death
all
over
him
came
for
the
rats
had
eaten
it
out
of
the
frame
as
he
looked
there
came
a
man
from
his
farm
he
had
a
countenance
white
with
alarm
lord
i
opened
your
granaries
this
morn
and
the
rats
had
eaten
all
your
another
came
running
presently
and
he
was
pale
as
pale
could
be
my
lord
bishop
fly
quoth
he
thousand
rats
are
coming
this
the
lord
forgive
you
for
yesterday
go
to
my
tower
on
the
rhine
replied
he
the
safest
place
in
germany
the
walls
are
high
and
the
shores
are
steep
and
the
stream
is
strong
and
the
water
bishop
hatto
fearfully
hastened
away
and
he
crossed
the
rhine
without
delay
and
reached
his
tower
and
barred
with
care
all
windows
doors
and
there
he
laid
him
down
and
closed
his
eyes
but
soon
a
scream
made
him
arise
he
started
and
saw
two
eyes
of
flame
on
his
pillow
from
whence
the
screaming
came
he
listened
and
was
only
the
cat
but
the
bishop
he
grew
more
fearful
for
that
for
she
sat
screaming
mad
with
fear
at
the
army
of
rats
that
were
drawing
near
for
they
have
swum
over
the
river
so
deep
and
they
have
climbed
the
shores
so
steep
and
up
the
tower
their
way
is
bent
to
do
the
work
for
which
they
were
sent
they
are
not
to
be
told
by
the
dozen
or
score
by
thousands
they
come
and
by
myriads
and
more
such
numbers
had
never
been
heard
of
before
such
a
judgment
had
never
been
witnessed
of
yore
down
on
his
knees
the
bishop
fell
and
faster
and
faster
his
beads
did
he
tell
as
louder
and
louder
drawing
near
the
gnawing
of
their
teeth
he
could
hear
and
in
at
the
windows
and
in
at
the
door
and
through
the
walls
they
pour
and
down
through
the
ceiling
and
up
through
the
floor
from
the
right
and
the
left
from
behind
and
before
from
within
and
without
from
above
and
below
and
all
at
once
to
the
bishop
they
go
they
have
whetted
their
teeth
against
the
stones
and
now
they
pick
the
bones
they
gnawed
the
flesh
from
every
limb
for
they
were
sent
to
do
judgment
on
him
a
legend
of
ehrenfels
many
other
tales
are
told
to
illustrate
cruelty
and
treachery
facing
the
mouse
tower
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
rhine
stands
the
castle
of
ehrenfels
the
scene
of
another
of
his
ignoble
deeds
conrad
brother
of
the
emperor
ludwig
had
it
is
said
been
seized
and
imprisoned
in
ehrenfels
by
the
franconian
lord
of
that
tower
adalbert
by
name
it
was
the
fortune
of
war
and
ludwig
in
turn
gathered
a
small
force
and
hastened
to
his
assistance
his
attempts
to
storm
the
castle
however
were
vain
the
stronghold
and
its
garrison
stood
firm
ludwig
was
minded
to
give
up
the
struggle
for
the
time
being
and
would
have
done
so
indeed
but
for
the
intervention
of
his
friend
and
adviser
bishop
hatto
him
to
me
said
the
crafty
churchman
know
how
to
deal
with
ludwig
was
curious
to
know
how
his
adviser
proposed
to
get
the
better
of
adalbert
whom
he
knew
of
old
to
be
a
man
of
courage
and
resource
but
toward
the
reigning
monarch
so
the
bishop
unfolded
his
scheme
to
which
ludwig
with
whom
honour
was
not
an
outstanding
feature
gave
his
entire
approval
in
pursuance
of
his
design
hatto
sallied
forth
unattended
and
made
his
way
to
the
beleaguered
fortress
adalbert
himself
a
stranger
to
cunning
and
trickery
hastened
to
admit
the
messenger
whose
garb
showed
him
to
be
a
priest
thinking
him
bound
on
an
errand
of
peace
hatto
professed
the
deepest
sorrow
at
the
quarrel
between
ludwig
and
adalbert
son
said
he
solemnly
is
not
meet
that
you
and
the
emperor
who
once
were
friends
should
treat
each
other
as
enemies
our
sire
is
ready
to
forgive
you
for
the
sake
of
old
friendship
will
you
not
give
him
the
opportunity
and
come
with
me
adalbert
was
entirely
deceived
by
the
seeming
sincerity
of
the
bishop
and
so
touched
by
the
clemency
of
the
sovereign
that
he
promised
to
go
in
person
and
make
submission
if
hatto
would
but
guarantee
his
safety
the
conversation
was
held
in
the
oratory
and
the
churchman
knelt
before
the
crucifix
and
swore
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
he
would
bring
adalbert
safely
back
to
his
castle
in
a
very
short
time
they
were
riding
together
on
the
road
to
mainz
where
ludwig
held
court
when
they
were
a
mile
or
two
from
ehrenfels
hatto
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
in
answer
to
the
questioning
glance
he
said
merrily
a
perfect
host
you
are
you
let
your
guest
depart
without
even
asking
him
whether
he
has
breakfasted
and
i
am
famishing
i
assure
you
the
courteous
adalbert
was
stricken
with
remorse
and
murmured
profuse
apologies
to
his
guest
must
think
but
poorly
of
my
hospitality
said
he
my
loyalty
i
forgot
my
duty
as
a
is
no
matter
said
hatto
still
laughing
since
we
have
come
but
a
little
way
would
it
not
be
better
to
return
to
ehrenfels
and
breakfast
you
are
young
and
strong
but
pleasure
replied
the
count
and
soon
they
were
again
within
the
castle
enjoying
a
hearty
meal
with
her
own
hands
the
young
countess
presented
a
beaker
of
wine
to
the
guest
and
he
ere
quaffing
it
cried
gaily
to
adalbert
health
may
you
have
the
reward
i
wish
for
you
once
again
they
set
out
on
their
journey
and
reached
mainz
about
nightfall
that
very
night
adalbert
was
seized
ignominiously
and
dragged
before
the
emperor
by
side
stood
the
false
bishop
means
this
outrage
cried
the
count
looking
from
one
to
the
other
art
a
traitor
said
ludwig
must
suffer
the
death
of
a
adalbert
addressed
himself
to
the
bishop
thou
he
said
gavest
me
thine
oath
that
thou
wouldst
bring
me
in
safety
to
did
i
not
do
so
fool
replied
hatto
contemptuously
it
my
fault
if
thou
didst
not
exact
a
pledge
ere
we
set
out
for
the
second
time
adalbert
saw
now
the
trap
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
his
fettered
limbs
trembled
with
anger
against
the
crafty
priest
but
he
was
impotent
with
him
to
the
block
said
the
emperor
sneered
hatto
still
chuckling
over
the
success
of
his
strategy
and
so
adalbert
went
forth
to
his
doom
the
victim
of
the
cruel
treachery
rheingrafenstein
rheingrafenstein
perched
upon
its
sable
foundations
of
porphyry
is
the
scene
of
a
legend
which
tells
of
a
terrible
bargain
with
theme
so
frequent
in
german
a
certain
nobleman
regarding
the
site
as
impregnable
and
therefore
highly
desirable
resolved
to
raise
a
castle
upon
the
lofty
eminence
but
the
more
he
considered
the
plan
the
more
numerous
appeared
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
its
consummation
every
pro
and
con
was
carefully
argued
but
to
no
avail
at
last
in
desperation
the
nobleman
implored
assistance
from
the
enemy
of
mankind
who
hearing
his
name
invoked
and
scenting
the
possibility
of
gaining
a
recruit
to
the
hosts
of
tartarus
speedily
manifested
his
presence
promising
to
build
the
castle
in
one
night
if
the
nobleman
would
grant
him
the
first
living
creature
who
should
look
from
its
windows
to
this
the
nobleman
agreed
and
upon
the
following
day
found
the
castle
awaiting
his
possession
he
did
not
dare
to
enter
it
however
but
he
had
communicated
his
secret
to
his
wife
who
decided
to
circumvent
the
evil
one
by
the
exercise
of
her
wit
mounting
her
donkey
she
rode
into
the
castle
bidding
all
her
men
follow
her
satan
waited
on
the
alert
but
the
countess
amid
great
laughter
pinned
a
kerchief
upon
the
head
covered
it
with
a
cap
and
leading
it
to
the
window
made
it
thrust
its
head
outside
satan
immediately
pounced
upon
what
he
believed
to
be
his
lawful
prey
and
with
joy
in
his
heart
seized
upon
and
carried
off
the
struggling
beast
of
burden
but
the
donkey
emitted
such
a
bray
that
recognizing
the
nature
of
his
prize
the
fiend
in
sheer
disgust
dropped
it
and
vanished
in
a
sulphurous
cloud
to
the
accompaniment
of
inextinguishable
laughter
from
rheingrafenstein
rüdesheim
and
its
legends
the
town
of
rüdesheim
is
a
place
famous
in
song
and
story
and
some
of
the
legends
connected
with
it
date
from
almost
prehistoric
times
passing
by
in
the
steamer
the
traveller
who
cares
for
architecture
will
doubtless
be
surprised
to
mark
an
old
church
which
would
seem
to
be
at
least
partly
of
norman
origin
but
this
is
not
the
only
french
association
which
rüdesheim
boasts
for
charlemagne
it
is
said
loved
the
place
and
frequently
resided
there
while
tradition
even
asserts
that
he
it
was
who
instituted
the
industry
on
the
adjacent
hills
he
perceived
that
whenever
snow
fell
there
it
melted
with
amazing
rapidity
and
judging
from
this
that
the
soil
was
eminently
suitable
for
bringing
forth
a
specially
fine
quality
of
grape
he
sent
to
france
for
a
few
young
vine
plants
soon
these
were
thriving
in
a
manner
which
fully
justified
expectations
the
wines
of
rüdesheim
became
exceptionally
famous
and
till
comparatively
recent
times
one
of
the
finest
blends
was
always
known
as
wein
von
orleans
for
it
was
thence
that
the
pristine
cuttings
had
been
imported
but
it
need
scarcely
be
said
perhaps
that
most
of
the
legends
current
at
rüdesheim
are
not
concerned
with
so
essentially
pacific
an
affair
as
the
production
of
rhenish
another
story
of
the
place
relates
how
one
of
its
medieval
noblemen
hans
graf
von
brauser
having
gone
to
palestine
with
a
band
of
crusaders
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
saracens
and
during
the
period
of
his
captivity
he
vowed
that
should
he
ever
regain
his
liberty
he
would
signify
his
pious
gratitude
by
causing
his
only
daughter
minna
to
take
the
veil
rather
a
selfish
kind
of
piety
this
appears
yet
mayhap
hans
was
really
devoted
to
his
daughter
and
his
resolution
to
part
with
her
possibly
entailed
a
sacrifice
while
be
that
as
it
may
he
had
the
reward
he
sought
for
now
his
prison
was
stormed
and
he
himself
released
whereupon
he
hastened
back
to
his
home
at
rüdesheim
with
intent
to
fulfil
his
promise
to
god
on
reaching
his
schloss
however
graf
hans
was
confronted
by
a
state
of
affairs
which
had
not
entered
into
his
calculations
the
fact
being
that
in
the
interim
his
daughter
had
conceived
an
affection
for
a
young
nobleman
called
walther
and
had
promised
to
marry
him
at
an
early
date
here
then
was
a
complication
indeed
and
hans
was
sorely
puzzled
to
know
how
to
act
while
the
unfortunate
minna
was
equally
perplexed
and
for
many
weeks
she
endured
literal
torment
her
heart
being
racked
by
a
constant
storm
of
emotions
she
was
deeply
attached
to
walther
and
she
felt
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
forgive
herself
if
she
broke
her
promise
to
him
and
failed
to
bring
him
the
happiness
which
both
were
confident
their
marriage
would
produce
but
on
the
other
hand
being
of
a
religious
disposition
she
perforce
respected
the
vow
her
father
had
made
and
thought
that
if
it
were
broken
he
and
all
his
household
would
be
doomed
to
eternal
damnation
while
even
walther
might
be
involved
in
their
ruin
i
make
him
happy
in
this
world
only
that
he
may
lose
his
soul
in
the
next
she
argued
while
again
and
again
her
father
reminded
her
that
a
promise
to
god
was
of
more
moment
than
a
promise
to
man
and
he
implored
her
to
hasten
to
the
nearest
convent
and
retire
behind
its
walls
still
she
wavered
however
and
still
her
father
pleaded
with
her
sometimes
actually
threatening
to
exert
his
parental
authority
one
evening
driven
to
despair
minna
sought
to
cool
her
throbbing
pulses
by
a
walk
on
the
heights
overlooking
the
rhine
at
rüdesheim
possibly
she
would
be
able
to
come
to
a
decision
there
she
thought
but
no
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
renounce
her
lover
and
with
a
cry
of
despair
she
flung
herself
over
the
steep
rocks
into
the
swirling
stream
a
hideous
death
it
was
the
maiden
was
immolated
on
the
altar
of
superstition
and
the
people
of
rüdesheim
were
awestruck
as
they
thought
of
the
pathetic
form
drifting
down
the
river
nor
did
posterity
fail
to
remember
the
story
and
down
to
recent
times
the
boatmen
of
the
neighbourhood
when
seeing
the
rhine
wax
stormy
at
the
place
where
minna
was
drowned
were
wont
to
whisper
that
her
soul
was
walking
abroad
and
that
the
maiden
was
once
again
wrestling
with
the
conflicting
emotions
which
had
broken
her
heart
long
ago
gisela
knight
brömser
of
rüdesheim
was
one
of
those
who
renounced
comfort
and
home
ties
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
the
crusaders
he
was
a
widower
and
possessed
a
beautiful
daughter
gisela
in
the
holy
wars
in
palestine
brömser
soon
became
distinguished
for
his
bravery
and
enterprises
requiring
wit
and
prowess
often
were
entrusted
to
him
now
it
befell
that
the
christian
camp
was
thrown
into
consternation
by
the
appearance
of
a
huge
dragon
which
took
up
its
abode
in
the
mountainous
country
the
only
locality
whence
water
could
be
procured
and
the
increasing
scarcity
of
the
supply
necessitated
the
extirpation
of
the
monster
the
crusaders
were
powerless
through
fear
many
of
them
regarded
the
dragon
as
a
punishment
sent
from
heaven
because
of
the
discord
and
rivalry
which
divided
them
at
last
the
brave
brömser
offered
to
attempt
the
destruction
and
after
a
valiant
struggle
he
succeeded
in
slaying
it
on
his
way
back
to
the
camp
he
was
surprised
by
a
party
of
saracens
and
after
various
hardships
was
cast
into
a
dungeon
here
he
remained
in
misery
for
a
long
while
and
during
his
solitary
confinement
he
made
a
vow
that
if
he
ever
returned
to
his
native
land
he
would
found
a
convent
and
dedicate
his
daughter
as
its
first
nun
some
time
later
the
stronghold
was
attacked
by
christians
and
the
knight
set
free
in
due
course
he
returned
to
rüdesheim
where
he
was
welcomed
by
gisela
and
the
day
after
his
arrival
a
young
knight
named
kurt
of
falkenstein
begged
him
for
her
hand
gisela
avowed
her
love
for
kurt
and
brömser
sadly
replied
that
he
would
willingly
accede
to
the
young
wishes
for
father
was
his
were
he
not
bound
by
a
solemn
vow
to
dedicate
his
daughter
to
the
church
when
falkenstein
at
last
understood
that
the
decision
was
irrevocable
he
galloped
off
as
if
crazed
the
vow
however
was
not
to
be
fulfilled
reason
became
unhinged
she
wandered
aimlessly
through
the
corridors
of
the
castle
and
one
dark
and
stormy
night
cast
herself
into
the
rhine
and
was
drowned
brömser
built
the
convent
but
in
vain
did
he
strive
to
free
his
conscience
from
remorse
many
were
his
benefactions
and
he
built
a
church
on
the
spot
where
one
of
his
servants
found
a
wooden
figure
of
the
crucified
which
was
credited
with
miraculous
powers
of
healing
but
all
to
no
purpose
haunted
by
the
accusing
spirit
of
his
unfortunate
daughter
he
gradually
languished
and
at
last
died
in
the
same
year
that
the
church
was
completed
further
up
the
river
is
oestrich
adjacent
to
which
stood
the
famous
convent
of
gottesthal
not
a
vestige
of
which
remains
to
mark
its
former
site
its
memory
is
preserved
however
in
the
following
appalling
legend
the
noble
referred
to
being
the
head
of
one
of
the
ancient
families
of
the
neighbourhood
the
nun
of
oestrich
among
the
inmates
of
gottesthal
was
a
nun
of
surpassing
loveliness
whose
beauty
had
aroused
the
wild
passion
of
a
certain
noble
undeterred
by
the
fact
of
the
lady
being
a
cloistered
nun
he
found
a
way
of
communicating
his
passion
to
her
and
at
last
met
her
face
to
face
despite
bars
and
bolts
eloquently
he
pleaded
his
love
swearing
to
free
her
from
her
bonds
to
devote
his
life
to
her
if
only
she
would
listen
to
his
entreaties
he
ended
his
asseverations
by
kneeling
before
the
statue
of
the
virgin
vowing
in
her
name
and
that
of
the
holy
babe
to
be
true
and
renouncing
his
hopes
of
heaven
if
he
should
fail
in
the
least
of
his
promises
the
nun
listened
and
in
the
end
overcome
by
his
fervour
consented
to
his
wishes
so
one
night
under
cover
of
the
darkness
she
stole
from
the
sheltering
convent
forgetting
her
vows
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
then
for
a
while
she
knew
a
guilty
happiness
but
even
this
was
of
short
duration
for
the
knight
soon
tired
and
grew
cold
toward
her
at
length
she
was
left
alone
scorned
and
sorrowful
a
prey
to
misery
while
her
betrayer
rode
off
in
search
of
other
loves
and
gaieties
spreading
abroad
as
he
went
the
story
of
his
conquest
and
his
desertion
when
the
injured
woman
learned
the
true
character
of
her
lover
her
love
changed
to
a
frenzied
hate
her
whole
being
became
absorbed
in
a
desire
for
revenge
her
thoughts
by
day
being
occupied
by
schemes
for
compassing
his
death
her
dreams
by
night
being
reddened
by
his
blood
at
last
she
plotted
with
a
band
of
ruffians
promising
them
great
rewards
if
they
would
assassinate
her
enemy
they
agreed
and
waylaying
the
noble
stabbed
him
fatally
in
the
name
of
the
woman
he
had
wronged
and
slighted
then
carrying
the
hacked
body
into
the
village
church
they
flung
it
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
that
night
the
nun
in
a
passion
of
insensate
fury
stole
into
the
holy
place
down
the
length
of
the
church
she
dragged
her
corpse
and
out
into
the
graveyard
tearing
open
his
body
and
plucking
his
heart
therefrom
with
a
fell
purpose
that
never
wavered
with
a
shriek
she
flung
it
on
the
ground
and
trampled
upon
it
in
a
ruthlessness
of
hate
terrible
to
contemplate
and
the
legend
goes
on
to
tell
that
after
her
death
she
still
pursued
her
lover
with
unquenchable
hatred
it
is
said
that
when
the
midnight
bell
is
tolling
she
may
yet
be
seen
seeking
his
tomb
from
which
she
lifts
a
bloody
heart
she
gazes
on
it
with
eyes
aflame
then
laughing
with
hellish
glee
flings
it
three
times
toward
the
skies
only
to
let
it
fall
to
earth
where
she
treads
it
beneath
her
feet
while
from
her
thick
white
veil
runnels
of
blood
pour
down
and
all
around
dreary
burn
and
shed
a
ghastly
glow
upon
the
awful
spectre
ingelheim
charlemagne
the
robber
among
the
multitude
of
legends
which
surround
the
name
of
charlemagne
there
can
hardly
be
found
a
quainter
or
more
interesting
one
than
that
which
has
for
a
background
the
old
town
of
ingelheim
home
where
at
one
time
the
emperor
held
his
court
it
is
said
that
one
night
when
charlemagne
had
retired
to
rest
he
was
disturbed
by
a
curious
dream
in
his
vision
he
saw
an
angel
descend
on
broad
white
pinions
to
his
bedside
and
the
heavenly
visitant
bade
him
in
the
name
of
the
lord
go
forth
and
steal
some
of
his
goods
the
angel
warned
him
ere
he
departed
that
the
speedy
forfeiture
of
throne
and
life
would
be
the
penalty
for
disregarding
the
divine
injunction
the
astonished
emperor
pondered
the
strange
message
but
finally
decided
that
it
was
but
a
dream
and
he
turned
on
his
side
to
finish
his
interrupted
slumbers
scarcely
had
he
closed
his
eyelids
however
ere
the
divine
messenger
was
again
at
his
side
exhorting
him
in
still
stronger
terms
to
go
forth
and
steal
ere
the
night
passed
and
threatening
him
this
time
with
the
loss
of
his
soul
if
he
failed
to
obey
when
the
angel
again
disappeared
the
trembling
monarch
raised
himself
in
bed
sorely
troubled
at
the
difficulty
of
his
situation
that
he
so
rich
so
powerful
that
he
wanted
for
nothing
should
be
asked
to
go
out
in
the
dead
of
night
and
steal
his
goods
like
any
of
the
common
robbers
whom
he
was
wont
to
punish
so
severely
no
the
thing
was
preposterous
some
fiend
had
appeared
in
angelic
form
to
tempt
him
and
again
his
weary
head
sank
in
his
pillow
rest
however
was
denied
him
for
a
third
time
the
majestic
being
appeared
and
in
tones
still
more
stern
demanded
his
obedience
thou
be
not
a
thief
said
he
yonder
moon
sinks
in
the
west
then
art
thou
lost
body
and
soul
for
the
emperor
could
no
longer
disbelieve
the
divine
nature
of
the
message
and
he
arose
sadly
dressed
himself
in
full
armour
and
took
up
his
sword
and
shield
his
spear
and
stealthily
he
quitted
his
chamber
fearing
every
moment
to
be
discovered
he
imagined
himself
being
detected
by
his
own
court
in
the
act
of
privily
leaving
his
own
palace
as
though
he
were
a
robber
and
the
thought
was
intolerable
but
his
fears
were
unfounded
porters
pages
grooms
yea
the
very
dogs
and
wrapped
in
a
profound
slumber
confirmed
in
his
determination
by
this
it
could
be
nothing
emperor
saddled
his
favourite
horse
which
alone
remained
awake
and
set
out
on
his
quest
it
was
a
beautiful
night
in
late
autumn
the
moon
hung
like
a
silver
shield
in
the
deep
blue
arch
of
the
sky
casting
weird
shadows
on
the
slopes
and
lighting
the
gloom
of
the
ancient
forests
but
charlemagne
had
no
eye
for
scenery
at
the
moment
he
was
filled
with
grief
and
shame
when
he
thought
of
his
mission
yet
he
dared
not
turn
aside
from
it
to
add
to
his
misery
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
technicalities
of
the
profession
thus
thrust
upon
him
and
did
not
quite
know
how
to
set
about
it
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
too
he
began
to
sympathize
with
the
robbers
he
had
outlawed
and
persecuted
and
to
understand
the
risks
and
perils
of
their
life
nevermore
he
vowed
would
he
hang
a
man
for
a
trifling
inroad
upon
his
property
as
he
thus
pursued
his
reflections
a
knight
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
armour
and
mounted
on
a
black
steed
issued
silently
from
a
clump
of
trees
and
rode
unseen
beside
him
charlemagne
continued
to
meditate
upon
the
dangers
and
misfortunes
of
a
life
is
elbegast
said
he
to
himself
a
small
offence
i
have
deprived
him
of
land
and
fee
and
have
hunted
him
like
an
animal
he
and
his
knights
risk
their
lives
for
every
meal
he
respects
not
the
cloth
of
the
church
it
is
true
yet
methinks
he
is
a
noble
fellow
for
he
robs
not
the
poor
or
the
pilgrim
but
rather
enriches
them
with
part
of
his
plunder
would
he
were
with
me
now
his
reflections
were
suddenly
stopped
for
he
now
observed
the
black
knight
riding
by
his
side
may
be
the
fiend
said
charlemagne
to
himself
spurring
his
steed
but
though
he
rode
faster
and
faster
his
strange
companion
kept
pace
with
him
at
length
the
emperor
reined
in
his
steed
and
demanded
to
know
who
the
stranger
might
be
the
black
knight
refused
to
answer
his
questions
and
the
two
thereupon
engaged
in
furious
combat
again
and
again
the
onslaught
was
renewed
till
at
last
charlemagne
succeeded
in
cleaving
his
blade
life
is
yours
said
the
black
knight
replied
the
monarch
would
i
with
your
life
tell
me
who
you
are
for
you
have
fought
gallantly
this
the
stranger
drew
himself
up
and
replied
with
simple
dignity
am
charlemagne
was
delighted
at
thus
having
his
wish
fulfilled
he
refused
to
divulge
his
name
but
intimated
that
he
too
was
a
robber
and
proposed
that
they
should
join
forces
for
the
night
have
it
said
he
will
rob
the
treasury
i
think
i
could
show
you
the
the
black
knight
paused
yet
he
said
i
wronged
the
emperor
and
i
shall
not
do
so
now
but
at
no
great
distance
stands
the
castle
of
eggerich
von
eggermond
to
the
emperor
he
has
persecuted
the
poor
and
betrayed
the
innocent
to
death
if
he
could
he
would
take
the
life
of
the
emperor
himself
to
whom
he
owes
all
let
us
repair
near
their
destination
they
tied
their
horses
to
a
tree
and
strode
across
the
fields
on
the
way
charlemagne
wrenched
off
the
iron
share
from
a
plough
remarking
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
tool
wherewith
to
bore
a
hole
in
the
castle
remark
which
his
comrade
received
in
silence
though
not
without
surprise
when
they
arrived
at
the
castle
elbegast
seemed
anxious
to
see
the
ploughshare
at
work
for
he
begged
charlemagne
to
begin
operations
know
not
how
to
find
entrance
said
the
latter
us
make
a
hole
in
the
wall
the
suggested
producing
a
boring
instrument
of
great
strength
the
emperor
gallantly
set
to
work
with
his
ploughshare
though
as
the
wall
was
ten
feet
thick
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
he
was
not
successful
the
robber
laughing
at
his
inexperience
showed
him
a
wide
chasm
which
his
boring
instrument
had
made
and
bade
him
remain
there
while
he
fetched
the
spoil
in
a
very
short
time
he
returned
with
as
much
plunder
as
he
could
carry
us
get
away
said
the
emperor
can
carry
no
said
elbegast
i
would
return
with
your
permission
in
the
chamber
occupied
by
eggerich
and
his
wife
there
is
a
wonderful
caparison
made
of
gold
and
covered
with
little
bells
i
want
to
prove
my
skill
by
carrying
it
you
will
was
laughing
response
without
a
sound
elbegast
reached
the
bedchamber
of
his
victim
and
was
about
to
raise
the
caparison
when
he
suddenly
stumbled
and
all
the
bells
rang
out
clearly
sword
my
sword
cried
eggerich
springing
up
while
elbegast
sank
back
into
the
shadows
said
the
lady
trying
to
calm
her
husband
did
but
hear
the
wind
or
perhaps
it
was
an
evil
dream
thou
hast
had
many
evil
dreams
of
late
eggerich
methinks
there
is
something
lies
heavily
on
thy
mind
wilt
thou
not
tell
thy
wife
elbegast
listened
intently
while
with
soft
words
and
caresses
the
lady
strove
to
win
her
secret
said
eggerich
at
last
in
sullen
tones
have
laid
a
plot
my
comrades
and
we
go
to
ingelheim
and
ere
noon
charlemagne
shall
be
slain
and
his
lands
divided
among
shrieked
the
lady
my
brother
that
will
you
never
while
i
have
strength
to
warn
but
the
villain
with
a
brutal
oath
struck
her
so
fiercely
in
the
face
that
the
blood
gushed
out
and
she
sank
back
unconscious
the
robber
was
not
in
a
position
to
avenge
the
cruel
act
but
he
crawled
nearer
the
couch
and
caught
some
of
the
blood
in
his
gauntlet
for
a
sign
to
the
emperor
when
he
was
once
more
outside
the
castle
he
told
his
companion
all
that
had
passed
and
made
as
though
to
return
will
strike
off
his
head
said
he
emperor
is
no
friend
of
mine
but
i
love
him
is
the
emperor
to
us
cried
charlemagne
you
mad
that
you
risk
our
lives
for
the
emperor
the
black
knight
looked
at
him
solemnly
we
had
not
sworn
friendship
said
he
life
should
pay
for
these
words
long
live
the
emperor
charlemagne
secretly
delighted
with
the
loyalty
of
the
outlawed
knight
recommended
him
to
seek
the
emperor
on
the
morrow
and
warn
him
of
his
danger
but
elbegast
fearing
the
gallows
would
not
consent
to
this
so
his
companion
promised
to
do
it
in
his
stead
and
meet
him
afterward
in
the
forest
with
that
they
parted
the
emperor
returning
to
his
palace
where
he
found
all
as
he
had
left
it
in
the
morning
he
hastily
summoned
his
council
told
them
of
his
dream
and
subsequent
adventures
and
of
the
plot
against
his
life
the
paladins
were
filled
with
horror
and
indignation
and
secretary
suggested
that
it
was
time
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
reception
of
the
assassins
each
band
of
traitors
as
they
arrived
was
seized
and
cast
into
a
dungeon
though
apparently
clad
as
peaceful
citizens
they
were
all
found
to
be
armed
the
last
band
to
arrive
was
led
by
eggerich
himself
great
was
his
dismay
when
he
saw
his
followers
led
off
in
chains
and
angrily
he
demanded
to
know
the
reason
for
such
treatment
charlemagne
thereupon
charged
him
with
treason
and
eggerich
flung
down
the
gauntlet
in
defiance
it
was
finally
arranged
that
the
emperor
should
provide
a
champion
to
do
battle
with
the
traitor
the
combat
to
take
place
at
sunrise
on
the
following
morning
a
messenger
rode
to
summon
elbegast
but
he
had
much
difficulty
in
convincing
the
black
knight
that
it
was
not
a
plot
to
secure
his
undoing
what
would
the
emperor
with
me
he
demanded
of
the
messenger
as
at
length
they
rode
toward
ingelheim
do
battle
to
the
death
with
a
deadly
foe
of
our
lord
the
von
bless
the
emperor
exclaimed
elbegast
fervently
raising
his
helmet
life
is
at
his
charlemagne
greeted
the
knight
affectionately
and
asked
what
he
had
to
tell
concerning
the
conspiracy
whereupon
sir
elbegast
fearlessly
denounced
the
villainous
eggerich
and
said
he
am
ready
to
prove
my
assertions
upon
his
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
at
daybreak
the
following
morning
a
fierce
combat
took
place
the
issue
however
was
never
in
doubt
sir
elbegast
was
victorious
the
false
eggerich
was
slain
and
his
body
hanged
on
a
gibbet
fifty
feet
high
the
emperor
now
revealed
himself
to
the
black
knight
both
as
his
and
as
the
messenger
who
had
brought
him
the
summons
to
attend
his
emperor
sister
the
widow
of
eggerich
he
gave
to
sir
elbegast
in
marriage
and
with
her
the
broad
lands
which
had
belonged
to
the
vanquished
traitor
thenceforward
the
erstwhile
robber
and
his
sovereign
were
fast
friends
the
place
where
these
strange
happenings
befell
was
called
ingelheim
in
memory
of
the
celestial
visitor
and
ingelheim
it
remains
to
this
day
the
knight
and
the
yellow
dwarf
elfeld
is
the
principal
town
of
the
rheingau
and
in
ancient
times
was
a
roman
station
called
alta
villa
in
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
town
by
ludwig
of
bavaria
and
placed
under
the
stewardship
of
the
counts
of
elz
these
counts
of
elz
dwelt
in
the
castle
by
the
edge
and
of
one
of
them
ferdinand
the
following
tale
is
told
this
knight
loved
pleasure
and
wild
living
and
would
indulge
his
whims
and
passions
without
regard
to
cost
before
long
he
found
that
as
a
result
of
his
extravagance
his
possessions
had
dwindled
away
almost
to
nothing
he
knew
himself
a
poor
man
yet
his
desire
for
pleasure
was
still
unsatisfied
mortified
and
angry
he
hid
himself
in
the
castle
of
elz
and
spent
his
time
lamenting
his
poverty
and
cursing
his
fate
while
in
this
frame
of
mind
the
news
reached
him
of
a
tournament
that
the
emperor
purposed
holding
in
celebration
of
his
wedding
to
this
were
summoned
the
chivalry
and
beauty
of
germany
from
far
and
near
and
soon
knights
and
ladies
were
journeying
to
take
their
part
in
the
tourney
the
feasting
and
dancing
ferdinand
realized
that
he
was
precluded
from
joining
his
brother
nobles
and
was
inconsolable
he
became
the
prey
of
rage
and
shame
and
at
last
resolved
to
end
a
life
condemned
to
ignominy
so
one
day
he
sought
a
height
from
which
to
hurl
himself
but
ere
he
could
carry
out
his
purpose
there
appeared
before
him
a
dwarf
clad
in
yellow
from
top
to
toe
with
a
leer
and
a
laugh
he
looked
up
at
the
frantic
knight
and
asked
why
the
richest
noble
in
the
land
should
be
seeking
death
something
in
the
tone
caused
ferdinand
to
listen
and
suddenly
to
hope
for
he
knew
not
what
miracle
his
eyes
gleamed
as
the
dwarf
went
on
to
speak
of
sacks
of
gold
and
when
the
little
creature
asked
for
but
a
single
hair
in
return
he
laughed
aloud
and
offered
him
a
hundred
but
the
dwarf
smiled
and
shook
his
head
the
noble
bowed
with
a
polite
gesture
and
as
he
bent
his
head
the
little
man
reached
up
and
plucked
out
but
one
hair
and
lo
a
sack
of
gold
straightway
appeared
at
this
ferdinand
thought
that
he
must
be
dreaming
but
the
sack
and
gold
pieces
were
real
enough
to
the
touch
albeit
the
dwarf
had
vanished
then
in
great
haste
ferdinand
bought
rich
and
costly
clothing
and
armour
also
a
steed
caparisoned
with
steel
and
purple
trappings
spending
on
these
more
than
twenty
sacks
of
gold
for
the
dwarf
returned
to
the
noble
many
times
and
on
each
occasion
gave
a
sack
of
gold
in
exchange
for
one
hair
at
last
ferdinand
set
out
for
the
tournament
where
besides
carrying
off
the
richest
prizes
and
winning
the
heart
of
many
a
fair
lady
he
attracted
the
notice
of
the
emperor
who
invited
him
to
stay
at
his
court
and
there
the
knight
resumed
his
former
passions
and
pleasures
living
the
wildest
of
lives
and
thinking
no
price
too
high
for
careless
enjoyment
and
each
night
ere
the
hour
of
twelve
finished
striking
the
yellow
dwarf
appeared
with
a
sack
of
gold
taking
his
usual
payment
of
only
one
hair
this
wild
life
now
began
to
tell
upon
ferdinand
he
fell
an
easy
prey
to
disease
which
the
doctors
could
not
cure
and
to
the
pricks
of
a
conscience
which
no
priests
could
soothe
all
his
wasted
past
rose
before
him
day
and
night
his
manifold
sins
appeared
before
him
like
avenging
furies
until
at
last
frenzied
by
this
double
torture
of
mind
and
body
he
called
upon
the
devil
to
aid
him
in
putting
an
end
to
his
miserable
existence
for
so
helpless
was
he
he
could
neither
reach
nor
use
a
weapon
then
at
his
side
appeared
once
more
the
dwarf
smiling
and
obliging
as
usual
he
proffered
not
a
sack
of
gold
this
time
but
a
rope
of
woven
hair
the
hair
which
he
had
taken
from
ferdinand
in
exchange
for
his
gold
in
the
morning
the
miserable
noble
was
found
hanging
by
that
rope
mainz
mainz
the
old
maguntiacum
was
the
principal
fortress
on
the
upper
rhine
in
roman
times
it
was
here
that
crescentius
one
of
the
first
preachers
of
the
christian
faith
on
the
rhine
regarded
by
local
tradition
as
the
pupil
of
peter
and
first
archbishop
of
mainz
suffered
martyrdom
in
the
reign
of
trajan
in
he
was
a
centurion
in
the
legion
which
had
been
engaged
under
titus
in
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
it
is
supposed
that
he
preached
the
gospel
in
mainz
for
years
before
his
execution
here
also
it
was
that
the
famous
vision
of
constantine
the
cross
in
the
sky
was
vouchsafed
to
the
christian
conqueror
as
he
went
forth
to
meet
the
forces
of
maxentius
the
field
of
the
holy
cross
in
the
vicinity
of
mainz
is
still
pointed
out
as
the
spot
where
this
miracle
took
place
the
city
flourished
under
the
carlovingians
and
was
in
a
high
state
of
prosperity
at
the
time
of
bishop
hatto
whose
name
as
we
have
seen
has
been
held
up
to
obloquy
in
many
legends
during
the
fourteenth
century
mainz
shared
the
power
and
glory
of
the
other
cities
of
the
rhenish
confederation
then
in
the
full
flush
of
its
heyday
its
cathedral
witnesses
to
its
aforetime
civic
splendour
this
magnificent
building
took
upward
of
four
hundred
years
to
complete
and
its
wondrous
brazen
doors
and
sumptuous
chapels
are
among
the
finest
ecclesiastical
treasures
of
germany
the
fiddler
in
the
cathedral
of
mainz
was
an
image
of
the
virgin
on
whose
feet
were
golden
slippers
the
gift
of
some
wealthy
votary
of
this
image
the
following
legend
is
told
a
poor
ragged
fiddler
had
spent
the
whole
of
one
bitter
winter
morning
playing
through
the
dreary
streets
without
any
taking
pity
upon
his
plight
as
he
came
to
the
cathedral
he
felt
an
overmastering
desire
to
enter
and
pour
out
his
distress
in
the
presence
of
his
maker
so
he
crept
in
a
tattered
and
forlorn
figure
he
prayed
aloud
chanting
his
woes
in
the
same
tones
which
he
used
in
the
street
to
touch
the
hearts
of
the
as
he
prayed
a
sense
of
solitude
came
upon
him
and
he
realized
that
the
shadowy
aisles
were
empty
a
sudden
whim
seized
him
he
would
play
to
the
virgin
and
sing
her
one
of
his
sweetest
songs
and
drawing
nearer
he
lifted
his
old
fiddle
to
his
shoulder
and
into
his
playing
he
put
all
his
longing
and
pain
his
quavering
voice
grew
stronger
beneath
the
stress
of
his
fervour
it
was
as
if
the
springtime
had
come
about
him
life
was
before
him
gay
and
joyful
sorrow
and
pain
were
unknown
he
sank
to
his
knees
before
the
image
and
as
he
knelt
suddenly
the
virgin
lifted
her
foot
and
loosening
her
golden
slipper
cast
it
into
the
old
ragged
bosom
as
if
giving
alms
for
his
music
the
poor
old
man
astounded
at
the
miracle
told
himself
that
the
blessed
virgin
knew
how
to
pay
a
poor
devil
who
amused
her
overcome
by
gratitude
he
thanked
the
giver
with
all
his
heart
he
would
fain
have
kept
the
treasure
but
he
was
starving
and
it
seemed
to
have
been
given
him
to
relieve
his
distress
he
hurried
out
to
the
market
and
went
into
a
shop
to
offer
his
prize
but
the
man
recognized
it
at
once
then
was
the
poor
old
fiddler
worse
off
than
before
for
now
he
was
charged
with
the
dreadful
crime
of
sacrilege
the
old
man
told
the
story
of
the
miracle
over
and
over
again
but
he
was
laughed
at
for
an
impudent
liar
he
must
not
hope
they
told
him
for
anything
but
death
and
in
the
short
space
of
one
hour
he
was
tried
and
condemned
and
on
his
way
to
execution
the
place
of
death
was
just
opposite
the
great
bronze
doors
of
the
cathedral
which
sheltered
the
virgin
i
must
die
said
the
fiddler
would
sing
one
song
to
my
old
fiddle
at
the
feet
of
the
virgin
and
pray
one
prayer
before
her
i
ask
this
in
her
blessed
name
and
you
can
not
refuse
they
could
not
deny
the
prisoner
a
dying
prayer
and
closely
guarded
the
tattered
figure
once
more
entered
the
cathedral
which
had
been
so
disastrous
to
him
he
approached
the
altar
of
the
virgin
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
again
he
held
his
old
fiddle
in
his
hands
then
he
played
and
sang
as
before
and
again
a
breath
as
of
springtime
stole
into
the
shadowy
cathedral
and
life
seemed
glad
and
beautiful
when
the
music
ceased
again
the
virgin
lifted
a
foot
and
softly
she
flung
her
other
slipper
into
the
bosom
before
the
astonished
gaze
of
the
guards
everyone
there
saw
the
miracle
and
could
not
but
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
old
former
statement
he
was
at
once
freed
from
his
bonds
and
carried
before
the
city
fathers
who
ordered
his
release
and
it
is
said
that
in
memory
of
the
miracle
of
the
virgin
the
priests
provided
for
the
old
fiddler
for
the
rest
of
his
days
in
return
for
this
the
old
man
surrendered
the
golden
slippers
which
it
is
also
said
the
reverend
fathers
carefully
locked
away
in
the
lest
the
virgin
should
again
be
tempted
to
such
extravagant
almsgiving
the
leap
once
in
the
hardt
mountains
there
dwelt
a
giant
whose
fortress
commanded
a
wide
view
of
the
surrounding
country
near
by
a
lovely
lady
as
daring
in
the
hunt
as
she
was
skilful
at
spinning
inhabited
an
abandoned
castle
one
day
the
twain
chanced
to
meet
and
the
giant
thereupon
resolved
to
possess
the
beauteous
damsel
so
he
sent
his
servant
to
win
her
with
jewels
but
the
deceitful
fellow
intended
to
hide
the
treasures
in
a
forest
there
he
met
a
young
man
musing
in
a
disconsolate
attitude
who
confided
that
poverty
alone
kept
him
from
avowing
how
passionately
he
adored
his
sweetheart
the
shrewd
messenger
realized
that
this
charmer
was
the
same
fair
lady
who
had
beguiled
his
soul
he
solicited
the
aid
in
burying
the
treasures
promising
him
a
share
in
the
spoil
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
wed
his
beloved
in
a
solitary
spot
they
dug
a
deep
hole
when
suddenly
the
robber
assailed
his
companion
who
thrust
him
aside
with
great
violence
in
his
rage
the
youth
was
about
to
stab
the
wretch
when
he
craved
pardon
promising
to
reveal
a
secret
of
more
value
than
the
jewels
he
had
intended
to
conceal
the
youth
stayed
his
hand
and
the
servant
related
how
his
master
for
love
of
the
pretty
mistress
of
the
castle
had
sent
him
to
gain
her
favour
conscious
of
his
worth
the
ardent
youth
scornfully
declared
that
he
feared
no
rival
then
seizing
half
of
the
treasure
he
left
the
wretch
to
his
own
devices
meanwhile
the
giant
impatiently
awaited
his
return
at
length
tired
of
waiting
he
decided
to
visit
the
lady
and
declare
in
person
his
passion
for
her
upon
his
arrival
at
the
castle
the
maid
announced
him
and
it
was
with
a
secret
feeling
of
dread
that
the
lady
went
to
meet
her
unwelcome
visitor
more
than
ever
captivated
by
her
charms
the
giant
asked
the
fair
maid
to
become
his
wife
on
being
refused
he
threatened
to
kill
her
and
demolish
the
castle
the
poor
lady
was
terrified
and
she
tearfully
implored
the
mercy
promising
to
bestow
all
her
treasure
upon
him
her
maids
too
begged
him
to
spare
their
life
but
he
only
laughed
as
they
knelt
before
him
ultimately
the
hapless
maiden
consented
to
marry
her
inexorable
wooer
but
she
attached
a
novel
condition
she
would
ride
a
race
with
her
relentless
suitor
and
should
he
overtake
her
she
would
accompany
him
to
his
castle
but
the
resolute
maiden
had
secretly
vowed
to
die
rather
than
submit
to
such
degradation
choosing
her
fleetest
steed
she
vaulted
nimbly
into
the
saddle
and
galloped
away
her
persecutor
pursued
close
behind
straining
every
nerve
to
come
up
with
her
shuddering
at
the
very
thought
of
becoming
his
bride
she
chose
death
as
the
only
alternative
so
she
spurred
her
horse
onward
to
the
edge
of
a
deep
chasm
the
noble
animal
neighed
loudly
as
though
conscious
of
impending
danger
the
pursuer
laughed
grimly
as
he
thought
to
seize
his
prize
but
his
laughter
was
turned
to
rage
when
the
horse
with
its
fair
burden
bounded
lightly
across
the
chasm
landing
safely
on
the
other
side
the
enraged
tyrant
now
beheld
his
intended
victim
kneeling
in
prayer
and
her
steed
calmly
grazing
among
the
green
verdure
by
her
side
he
strode
furiously
hither
and
thither
searching
for
a
crossing
and
suddenly
a
shout
of
joy
told
the
affrighted
maid
that
he
had
discovered
some
passage
his
satisfaction
however
was
for
just
then
a
strange
knight
with
drawn
sword
rushed
upon
the
giant
the
maid
watched
the
contest
with
breathless
fear
and
many
times
she
thought
that
the
tyrant
would
slay
her
protector
at
last
in
one
such
moment
the
giant
stooped
to
clutch
a
huge
boulder
with
which
he
meant
to
overwhelm
his
adversary
when
overreaching
himself
he
slipped
and
fell
headlong
down
the
steep
rocks
then
the
maid
hastened
to
thank
her
rescuer
and
great
was
her
surprise
to
discover
in
the
gallant
knight
the
youth
whose
former
poverty
had
kept
him
from
wooing
her
they
returned
to
the
castle
together
and
it
was
not
long
ere
they
celebrated
their
wedding
both
lived
long
and
happily
and
their
union
was
blessed
with
many
children
the
rock
is
still
known
as
the
wonderful
road
near
homburg
on
the
pinnacle
of
a
lofty
mountain
are
the
ruins
of
falkenstein
castle
access
to
which
is
gained
by
a
steep
winding
path
within
the
castle
walls
there
once
dwelt
a
maiden
of
surpassing
beauty
many
suitors
climbed
the
stern
acclivity
to
woo
this
charming
damsel
but
her
stern
father
repelled
one
and
all
only
kuno
of
sayn
was
firm
enough
to
persevere
in
his
suit
against
the
rebuffs
of
the
stubborn
lord
of
falkenstein
and
in
the
end
he
was
rewarded
with
the
smiles
and
kind
looks
of
the
fair
maid
one
evening
as
they
watched
the
sun
set
kuno
pointed
out
to
the
maiden
where
his
own
castle
was
situated
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
beneath
them
made
its
appeal
to
their
souls
their
hands
touched
and
clasped
and
their
hearts
throbbed
with
the
passion
felt
by
both
a
few
days
later
kuno
climbed
the
steep
path
resolved
to
declare
his
love
to
the
father
fatigued
with
the
ascent
he
rested
for
a
brief
space
at
the
entrance
to
the
castle
ere
mounting
to
the
tower
the
lord
of
falkenstein
and
his
daughter
had
beheld
journey
up
the
rugged
path
from
the
windows
of
the
tower
and
the
father
demanded
for
what
purpose
he
had
come
thither
with
a
passionate
glance
at
the
blushing
maid
the
knight
of
sayn
declared
that
he
had
come
to
ask
the
noble
lord
for
his
hand
in
marriage
after
meditating
on
the
proposal
for
some
time
the
lord
of
falkenstein
pretended
to
be
willing
to
give
his
he
attached
a
condition
desire
a
to
be
made
from
the
lowland
beneath
to
the
gate
of
my
castle
and
if
you
can
accomplish
this
my
hand
is
the
feat
must
be
achieved
by
morning
the
knight
protested
that
such
a
task
was
utterly
impossible
for
anyone
to
perform
even
in
a
month
but
all
to
no
purpose
he
then
resolved
to
seek
some
way
whereby
he
could
outwit
the
stubborn
lord
for
he
would
not
willingly
resign
his
he
left
the
tower
vowing
to
do
his
utmost
to
perform
the
seemingly
impossible
task
and
as
he
descended
the
rocky
declivity
his
beloved
waved
her
handkerchief
to
encourage
him
now
kuno
of
sayn
possessed
both
copper
and
silver
mines
and
arriving
at
his
castle
he
summoned
his
overseer
the
knight
explained
the
nature
of
the
task
which
he
desired
to
be
undertaken
but
the
overseer
declared
that
all
his
miners
working
day
and
night
could
not
make
the
roadway
within
many
months
dismayed
kuno
left
his
castle
and
wandered
into
a
dense
forest
driven
thither
by
his
perturbed
condition
night
cast
dusky
shadows
over
the
foliage
and
the
perplexed
lover
cursed
the
obstinate
lord
of
falkenstein
as
he
forced
his
way
through
the
undergrowth
suddenly
an
old
man
of
strange
and
wild
appearance
stood
in
his
path
kuno
at
once
knew
him
for
an
one
of
those
mysterious
guardians
of
the
treasures
of
the
soil
who
are
jealous
of
the
incursion
of
mankind
into
their
domain
of
sayn
he
said
you
desire
to
outwit
the
lord
of
falkenstein
and
win
his
beauteous
daughter
although
startled
and
taken
aback
by
the
strange
apparition
kuno
hearkened
eagerly
to
its
words
as
showing
an
avenue
of
escape
from
the
dilemma
in
which
he
found
himself
i
do
he
replied
how
do
you
propose
i
should
accomplish
it
to
persecute
me
and
my
brethren
kuno
and
we
shall
help
you
to
realize
your
wishes
was
the
reply
you
exclaimed
kuno
what
manner
do
i
trouble
you
at
all
strange
being
have
opened
up
a
silver
mine
in
our
domain
said
the
as
you
work
it
both
morning
and
afternoon
we
have
but
little
opportunity
for
repose
how
i
ask
you
can
we
slumber
when
your
men
keep
knocking
on
the
partitions
of
our
house
with
their
picks
then
would
you
have
my
worthy
friend
asked
kuno
scarcely
able
to
suppress
a
smile
at
the
wistful
way
in
which
the
gnome
made
his
complaint
me
i
pray
you
how
i
can
oblige
instructing
your
miners
to
work
in
the
mine
during
the
hours
of
morning
only
replied
the
gnome
so
doing
i
and
my
brothers
will
obtain
the
rest
we
so
much
shall
be
as
you
say
said
kuno
have
my
word
for
it
good
that
case
said
the
shall
assist
you
in
turn
go
to
the
castle
of
falkenstein
after
dawn
morning
and
you
shall
witness
the
result
of
our
friendship
and
next
morning
the
sun
had
scarcely
risen
when
kuno
saddled
his
steed
and
hied
him
to
the
heights
of
falkenstein
the
gnome
had
kept
his
word
there
above
and
in
front
of
him
he
beheld
a
wide
and
lofty
roadway
leading
to
the
from
the
thoroughfare
below
with
joy
in
his
heart
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
dashed
up
the
steep
but
smooth
acclivity
at
the
gate
he
encountered
the
old
lord
of
falkenstein
and
his
daughter
who
had
been
apprised
of
the
miracle
that
had
happened
and
had
come
out
to
view
the
new
roadway
the
knight
of
sayn
related
his
adventure
with
the
upon
which
the
lord
of
falkenstein
told
him
how
a
terrible
thunderstorm
mingled
with
unearthly
noises
had
raged
throughout
the
night
terrified
he
and
his
daughter
had
spent
the
hours
of
darkness
in
prayer
until
with
the
approach
of
dawn
some
of
the
servitors
had
plucked
up
courage
and
ventured
forth
when
the
wonderful
avenue
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
met
their
startled
gaze
kuno
and
his
were
duly
united
indeed
so
terrified
was
the
old
lord
by
the
supernatural
manifestations
of
the
dreadful
night
he
had
just
passed
through
that
he
was
incapable
of
further
resistance
to
the
wishes
of
the
young
people
the
wonderful
road
is
still
to
be
seen
and
is
marvelled
at
by
all
who
pass
that
way
osric
the
lion
other
tales
besides
the
foregoing
have
their
scene
laid
in
the
castle
of
falkenstein
notable
among
them
being
the
legend
of
osric
the
lion
embodied
in
the
following
weird
ballad
from
the
pen
of
monk
lewis
swift
roll
the
billows
and
water
the
plains
where
falkenstein
majestic
remains
their
turrets
still
rear
oft
loves
the
gaunt
wolf
the
ruins
to
prowl
what
time
from
the
battlements
pours
the
lone
owl
her
plaints
in
the
ear
no
longer
resound
through
the
vaults
of
yon
hall
the
song
of
the
minstrel
and
mirth
of
the
ball
those
pleasures
for
ever
are
fled
there
now
dwells
the
bat
with
her
brood
there
ravens
and
vultures
now
clamour
for
food
and
all
is
dark
silent
and
dread
ha
dost
thou
not
see
by
the
trembling
light
directing
his
steps
where
advances
a
knight
his
eye
big
with
vengeance
and
fate
osric
the
lion
his
nephew
who
leads
and
swift
up
the
crackling
old
staircase
proceeds
gains
the
hall
and
quick
closes
the
gate
now
round
him
young
carloman
casting
his
eyes
surveys
the
sad
scene
with
dismay
and
surprise
and
fear
steals
the
rose
from
his
cheeks
his
spirits
forsake
him
his
courage
is
flown
the
hand
of
sir
osric
he
clasps
in
his
own
and
while
his
voice
falters
he
speaks
uncle
he
murmurs
linger
we
here
late
and
these
chambers
are
damp
and
are
drear
keen
blows
through
the
ruins
the
blast
oh
let
us
away
and
our
journey
pursue
fair
castle
will
rise
on
our
view
soon
as
falkenstein
forest
be
passed
roll
thus
your
eyeballs
why
glare
they
so
wild
oh
chide
not
my
weakness
nor
frown
that
a
child
should
view
these
apartments
with
dread
for
know
that
full
oft
have
i
heard
from
my
nurse
there
still
on
this
castle
has
rested
a
curse
since
innocent
blood
here
was
shed
said
too
bad
spirits
and
ghosts
all
in
white
here
used
to
resort
at
the
dead
time
of
night
nor
vanish
till
breaking
of
day
and
still
at
their
coming
is
heard
the
deep
tone
of
a
bell
loud
and
hark
a
groan
good
uncle
oh
let
us
away
serpent
thus
osric
the
lion
replies
while
rage
and
malignity
gleam
in
his
eyes
journey
and
life
here
must
close
thy
proud
turrets
no
more
shalt
thou
see
no
more
betwixt
lordship
and
me
shalt
thou
stand
and
my
greatness
oppose
brother
lies
breathless
on
plains
and
thou
once
removed
to
his
noble
domains
my
right
can
no
rival
deny
then
stripling
prepare
on
my
dagger
to
bleed
no
succour
is
near
and
thy
fate
is
decreed
commend
thee
to
jesus
and
die
thus
saying
he
seizes
the
boy
by
the
arm
whose
grief
rends
the
vaulted
roof
while
alarm
his
heart
of
all
fortitude
robs
his
limbs
sink
beneath
him
distracted
with
fears
he
falls
at
his
feet
bathes
them
with
tears
and
me
oh
spare
me
he
sobs
but
vainly
the
miscreant
he
tries
to
appease
and
vainly
he
clings
in
despair
round
his
knees
and
sues
in
soft
accents
for
life
unmoved
by
his
sorrow
unmoved
by
his
prayer
fierce
osric
has
twisted
his
hand
in
his
hair
and
aims
at
his
bosom
a
knife
but
ere
the
steel
blushes
with
blood
strange
to
tell
does
the
tongue
of
the
bell
the
presence
of
midnight
declare
and
while
with
amazement
his
hair
bristles
high
hears
osric
a
voice
loud
and
terrible
cry
in
sounds
straight
curses
and
shrieks
through
the
chamber
resound
shrieks
mingled
with
laughter
the
walls
shake
around
the
groaning
roof
threatens
to
fall
loud
bellows
the
thunder
blue
lightnings
still
flash
the
casements
they
clatter
chains
rattle
doors
clash
and
flames
spread
their
waves
through
the
hall
the
clamour
increases
the
portals
expand
the
black
marble
now
rushes
a
band
of
demons
all
dropping
with
gore
in
visage
so
grim
and
so
monstrous
in
height
that
carloman
screams
as
they
burst
on
his
sight
and
sinks
without
sense
on
the
floor
not
so
his
fell
uncle
sees
that
the
throng
impels
wildly
shrieking
a
female
along
and
well
the
sad
spectre
he
knows
the
demons
with
curses
her
steps
onwards
urge
her
shoulders
with
whips
formed
of
serpents
they
scourge
and
fast
from
her
wounds
the
blood
flows
welcome
she
cried
and
her
voice
spoke
despair
welcome
sir
osric
the
torments
to
share
of
which
thou
hast
made
me
the
prey
twelve
years
have
i
languished
thy
coming
to
see
ulrilda
who
perished
dishonoured
by
thee
now
calls
thee
to
anguish
away
passion
once
sated
thy
love
became
hate
thy
hand
gave
the
draught
which
consigned
me
to
fate
nor
thought
i
death
lurked
in
the
bowl
unfit
for
the
grave
stained
with
lust
swelled
with
pride
unblessed
unabsolved
unrepenting
i
died
and
demons
straight
seized
on
my
soul
and
with
transport
i
feel
my
breast
swell
full
long
have
i
suffered
the
torments
of
hell
and
now
shall
its
pleasures
be
mine
see
see
how
the
fiends
are
athirst
for
thy
blood
twelve
years
has
my
panting
heart
furnished
their
food
come
wretch
let
them
feast
upon
thine
she
said
and
the
demons
their
prey
flocked
around
they
dashed
him
with
horrible
yell
on
the
ground
and
blood
down
his
limbs
trickled
fast
his
eyes
from
their
sockets
with
fury
they
tore
they
fed
on
his
entrails
all
reeking
with
gore
and
his
heart
was
repast
but
now
the
grey
cock
told
the
coming
of
day
the
fiends
with
their
victim
straight
vanished
away
and
heart
throbbed
again
with
terror
recalling
the
deeds
of
the
night
he
rose
and
from
falkenstein
speeding
his
flight
soon
reached
his
paternal
domain
since
then
all
with
horror
the
ruins
behold
no
shepherd
though
strayed
be
a
lamb
from
his
fold
no
mother
though
lost
be
her
child
the
fugitive
dares
in
these
chambers
to
seek
where
fiends
nightly
revel
and
guilty
ghosts
shriek
in
accents
most
fearful
and
wild
oh
shun
them
ye
pilgrims
though
late
be
the
hour
though
loud
howl
the
tempest
and
fast
fall
the
shower
from
falkenstein
castle
begone
there
still
their
sad
banquet
denizens
share
there
osric
the
lion
still
raves
in
despair
breathe
a
prayer
for
his
soul
and
pass
on
the
conference
of
the
dead
a
legend
of
later
date
than
most
of
the
rhineland
tales
but
still
of
sufficient
interest
to
merit
inclusion
among
these
is
that
which
attaches
to
the
palace
of
biberich
biberich
lies
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
not
very
far
from
mainz
and
its
palace
was
built
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
by
george
augustus
duke
of
nassau
the
legend
states
that
not
long
after
the
erection
of
the
palace
a
duchess
of
nassau
died
there
and
lay
in
state
as
befitted
her
rank
in
a
room
hung
with
black
velvet
and
lighted
with
the
glimmer
of
many
tapers
outside
in
the
great
hall
a
captain
and
men
of
the
bodyguard
kept
watch
over
the
chamber
of
death
it
was
midnight
the
captain
of
the
guard
weary
with
his
vigil
had
gone
to
the
door
of
the
palace
for
a
breath
of
air
just
as
the
last
stroke
of
the
hour
died
away
he
beheld
the
approach
of
a
chariot
drawn
by
six
magnificent
horses
which
to
his
amazement
drew
up
before
the
palace
a
lady
veiled
and
clad
in
white
alighted
and
made
as
though
she
would
enter
the
building
but
the
captain
barred
the
way
and
challenged
the
bold
intruder
are
you
he
said
sternly
seek
to
enter
the
palace
at
this
hour
my
orders
are
to
let
none
was
first
lady
of
the
bedchamber
to
our
late
duchess
replied
the
lady
in
cold
imperious
tones
i
demand
the
right
of
as
she
spoke
she
flung
aside
her
veil
and
the
captain
instantly
recognizing
her
permitted
her
to
enter
the
palace
without
further
hindrance
can
she
want
here
at
this
time
of
night
he
said
to
his
lieutenant
when
the
lady
had
passed
into
the
can
say
replied
the
lieutenant
perchance
he
mused
were
to
the
captain
took
the
hint
crept
softly
to
the
keyhole
and
applied
his
eye
thereto
he
said
shrinking
back
in
amazement
and
terror
and
beckoning
to
his
lieutenant
name
what
have
we
here
the
lieutenant
hastened
to
the
chamber
door
full
of
alarm
and
curiosity
putting
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
he
also
ejaculated
turned
pale
and
trembled
one
by
one
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
followed
their
example
like
them
to
retreat
with
exclamations
of
horror
and
little
wonder
for
they
perceived
the
dead
duchess
sitting
up
in
bed
moving
her
pale
lips
as
though
in
conversation
while
by
her
side
stood
the
lady
of
the
bedchamber
pale
as
she
and
clad
in
for
a
time
the
ghastly
conversation
continued
no
words
being
audible
to
the
guard
but
from
time
to
time
a
hollow
sound
reached
them
like
the
murmur
of
distant
thunder
at
length
the
visitor
emerged
from
the
chamber
and
returned
to
her
waiting
coach
duty
rather
than
inclination
obliged
the
gallant
captain
to
hand
her
into
her
carriage
and
this
task
he
performed
with
praiseworthy
politeness
though
his
heart
sank
within
him
at
the
touch
of
her
icy
fingers
and
his
tongue
refused
to
return
the
adieu
her
pale
lips
uttered
with
a
flourish
of
whips
the
chariot
set
off
sparks
flew
from
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
smoke
and
flame
burst
from
their
nostrils
and
such
was
their
speed
that
in
a
moment
they
were
lost
to
sight
the
captain
sorely
puzzled
by
the
events
of
the
night
returned
to
his
men
who
were
huddled
together
at
the
end
of
the
hall
furthest
from
the
on
the
morrow
ere
the
guard
had
had
time
to
inform
the
duke
of
these
strange
happenings
news
reached
the
palace
that
the
first
lady
of
the
bedchamber
had
died
on
the
previous
night
at
twelve
it
was
supposed
that
sorrow
for
her
mistress
had
caused
her
death
eppstein
of
the
castle
of
eppstein
whose
ruins
still
remain
in
a
valley
of
the
taunus
mountains
north
of
biberich
the
following
curious
story
is
told
sir
eppo
a
brave
and
chivalrous
a
wealthy
one
to
boot
as
were
his
successors
of
eppstein
for
many
one
day
hunting
in
the
forest
when
he
became
separated
from
his
attendants
and
lost
his
way
in
the
heat
of
the
chase
his
sense
of
direction
had
failed
him
and
though
he
sounded
his
bugle
loud
and
long
there
was
no
reply
tired
out
at
length
with
wandering
hither
and
thither
he
rested
himself
in
a
pleasant
glade
and
was
surprised
and
charmed
to
hear
a
voice
singing
a
mournful
melody
in
soft
clear
tones
it
was
a
sheer
delight
to
sir
eppo
to
listen
to
a
voice
of
such
exquisite
purity
yet
admiration
was
not
the
only
feeling
it
roused
in
his
breast
there
was
a
note
of
sadness
and
appeal
in
the
song
and
what
were
knighthood
worth
if
it
heeded
not
the
voice
of
fair
lady
in
distress
sir
eppo
sprang
to
his
feet
forgetting
his
own
plight
in
the
ardour
of
chivalry
and
set
off
in
the
direction
from
which
the
voice
seemed
to
come
the
way
was
difficult
and
he
had
to
cut
a
passage
with
his
sword
through
the
dense
thicket
that
separated
him
from
the
singer
at
length
guided
by
the
melancholy
notes
he
arrived
before
a
grotto
in
which
he
beheld
a
maiden
of
surpassing
beauty
but
of
sorrowful
mien
when
she
saw
the
handsome
knight
gazing
at
her
with
mingled
surprise
and
admiration
she
ceased
her
song
and
implored
his
aid
a
cruel
giant
she
said
had
seized
her
and
brought
her
thither
at
the
moment
he
was
asleep
but
he
had
tied
her
to
a
rock
so
that
she
might
not
escape
her
beauty
and
grace
her
childlike
innocence
her
piteous
plight
moved
sir
eppo
strangely
first
pity
then
a
stronger
emotion
dawned
in
his
breast
he
severed
her
bonds
with
a
stroke
of
his
keen
falchion
can
i
do
to
aid
thee
gentle
maiden
he
said
have
but
to
command
me
henceforth
i
am
thy
knight
to
do
battle
for
the
damsel
blushed
at
the
courteous
words
but
she
lifted
her
eyes
bravely
to
the
champion
who
had
so
unexpectedly
appeared
to
protect
her
to
my
castle
she
said
there
thou
wilt
find
a
consecrated
net
bring
it
hither
if
i
lay
it
upon
the
giant
he
will
become
as
weak
as
a
babe
and
will
be
easily
eagerly
the
young
knight
obeyed
the
command
and
having
found
the
net
according
to
the
directions
he
made
all
haste
to
return
at
the
grotto
he
paused
and
hid
himself
for
the
strident
voice
of
the
giant
could
be
heard
within
presently
the
monster
emerged
and
departed
in
search
of
reeds
wherewith
to
make
a
pipe
no
sooner
had
he
disappeared
than
the
maiden
issued
from
the
grotto
and
sir
eppo
came
out
of
his
concealment
and
gave
her
the
consecrated
net
she
spoke
a
few
words
of
heartfelt
gratitude
and
then
hurried
with
her
treasure
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
where
she
knew
the
giant
had
intended
to
go
arrived
at
her
destination
she
laid
down
the
net
and
covered
it
with
moss
leaves
and
herbs
while
engaged
in
her
task
the
giant
came
up
and
the
damsel
smilingly
told
him
that
she
was
preparing
a
couch
whereon
he
might
take
some
rest
gratified
at
her
solicitude
he
stretched
himself
unsuspectingly
on
the
fragrant
pile
in
a
moment
the
damsel
uttering
the
name
of
the
trinity
threw
a
portion
of
the
net
over
him
so
that
he
was
completely
enveloped
immediately
there
arose
such
loud
oaths
and
lamentations
that
the
damsel
ran
in
terror
to
the
knight
who
had
now
come
upon
the
scene
us
fly
she
said
he
should
escape
and
pursue
but
sir
eppo
strode
to
the
place
where
the
howling
monster
lay
entangled
in
the
net
and
with
a
mighty
effort
rolled
him
over
a
steep
precipice
where
he
was
instantly
killed
the
story
ends
happily
for
sir
eppo
and
the
maiden
he
had
rescued
were
married
soon
after
and
on
the
spot
where
they
had
first
met
was
raised
the
castle
of
eppstein
it
is
said
that
the
bones
of
the
giant
may
still
be
seen
there
flörsheim
the
shepherd
knight
in
the
now
ruined
castle
of
wilenstein
overlooking
the
wooded
heights
of
the
westrich
dwelt
sir
bodo
of
flörsheim
and
his
fair
daughter
adeline
the
beauty
no
less
than
her
wealth
attracted
suitors
in
plenty
from
the
neighbouring
strongholds
but
the
spirit
of
love
had
not
yet
awakened
in
her
bosom
and
each
and
all
were
repulsed
with
disconcerting
coldness
and
indifference
and
they
left
the
schloss
vowing
that
the
lovely
adeline
was
utterly
heartless
one
day
there
came
to
sir
bodo
a
youth
of
pleasing
manners
and
appearance
picturesquely
clad
in
rustic
garb
who
begged
that
he
might
enter
the
service
in
the
capacity
of
shepherd
though
he
hinted
that
he
was
of
noble
birth
prevented
by
circumstances
from
revealing
his
identity
yet
he
based
his
request
solely
on
his
merits
as
a
tender
of
flocks
and
herds
and
as
sir
bodo
found
that
he
knew
his
work
well
and
that
his
intelligence
was
beyond
question
he
gave
him
the
desired
post
as
time
went
on
sir
bodo
saw
no
reason
to
regret
his
action
for
his
flocks
and
herds
prospered
as
they
had
never
done
before
and
none
but
good
reports
reached
him
concerning
his
servant
meantime
adeline
heard
constant
references
to
otto
as
the
shepherd
was
called
both
from
her
father
and
her
the
former
praised
his
industry
and
abilities
while
the
latter
spoke
of
his
handsome
looks
and
melancholy
air
his
distinction
and
good
breeding
and
the
mystery
which
surrounded
his
identity
all
this
excited
the
curiosity
and
her
pity
was
aroused
as
well
for
it
seemed
that
the
stranger
had
a
secret
grief
which
sometimes
found
vent
in
tears
when
he
thought
himself
unobserved
adeline
saw
him
for
the
first
time
one
afternoon
while
she
was
walking
in
the
castle
grounds
at
sight
of
her
he
paused
as
though
and
the
maiden
blushed
under
his
earnest
scrutiny
a
moment
later
however
he
recovered
himself
and
courteously
asked
her
pardon
for
his
seeming
rudeness
me
fair
lady
said
he
seemed
that
i
saw
a
ghost
in
your
sweet
adeline
who
had
recognized
him
from
the
descriptions
she
had
received
now
made
herself
known
to
him
and
graciously
granted
him
permission
to
walk
with
her
to
the
castle
his
offence
was
readily
pardoned
when
he
declared
that
the
cause
of
it
was
a
fancied
resemblance
between
adeline
and
a
dear
sister
whom
death
had
lately
robbed
him
of
ere
they
parted
the
young
people
were
already
deeply
in
love
with
one
another
and
had
promised
to
meet
again
on
the
following
day
the
spot
where
they
had
first
encountered
each
other
became
a
which
was
daily
hallowed
by
fresh
vows
and
declarations
on
one
such
occasion
otto
told
his
beloved
the
story
of
his
early
life
and
revealed
to
her
his
identity
it
was
indeed
a
harrowing
tale
and
one
which
drew
a
full
meed
of
sympathy
from
the
maiden
otto
and
his
whose
likeness
in
face
had
first
arrested
his
been
brought
up
by
a
cruel
stepfather
who
had
treated
them
so
brutally
that
otto
was
at
length
forced
to
flee
to
the
castle
of
an
uncle
who
received
him
kindly
and
gave
him
an
education
befitting
his
knightly
station
a
few
years
later
he
had
returned
home
to
find
his
sister
by
the
of
her
stepfather
who
it
was
even
said
had
hastened
her
death
with
poison
otto
overcome
with
grief
confronted
her
murderer
heaped
abuse
on
his
head
and
demanded
his
share
of
the
property
the
only
answer
was
a
sneer
and
the
youth
maddened
with
grief
and
indignation
drew
his
sword
and
plunged
it
in
his
heart
a
moment
later
he
saw
the
probable
consequences
of
his
hasty
action
concealed
himself
in
the
woods
and
thenceforth
became
a
fugitive
renounced
even
by
his
own
uncle
and
obliged
to
remain
in
hiding
in
order
to
escape
certain
death
at
the
hands
of
the
murdered
kindred
in
a
fortunate
moment
he
had
chanced
to
reach
flörsheim
where
in
his
guise
he
judged
himself
secure
adeline
deeply
moved
by
the
tale
sought
to
put
her
sympathy
in
the
practical
form
of
advice
otto
she
said
us
go
to
my
father
and
tell
him
all
we
must
dispatch
an
embassy
to
your
uncle
in
thuringen
to
see
whether
he
may
not
consent
to
a
division
of
the
property
take
courage
and
your
rightful
position
may
yet
be
so
it
was
arranged
that
on
the
following
day
the
lovers
should
seek
sir
bodo
and
ask
his
advice
in
the
matter
but
alas
ere
their
plans
could
be
carried
out
bodo
himself
sent
for
his
daughter
and
informed
her
that
he
had
chosen
a
husband
for
her
sir
siegebert
a
wealthy
and
noble
knight
just
returned
from
palestine
in
vain
adeline
wept
and
implored
her
father
remained
adamant
and
at
last
lost
his
temper
and
confined
her
within
strict
bounds
till
she
should
consent
to
the
marriage
sir
siegebert
was
but
ill
pleased
with
her
pale
cheeks
and
haggard
eyes
and
her
obvious
distaste
for
his
society
and
seeing
this
bodo
was
more
than
ever
wroth
and
swore
to
send
her
to
a
nunnery
if
she
did
not
greet
her
lover
with
a
better
face
day
after
day
otto
waited
at
the
yet
his
mistress
did
not
appear
nor
did
she
send
him
any
message
he
was
filled
with
anguish
at
the
thought
that
her
ardent
vows
were
forgotten
and
wandered
through
the
woods
like
one
distraught
seeking
solace
and
finding
none
at
length
news
reached
him
that
on
the
morrow
his
beloved
was
to
wed
with
the
knight
siegebert
and
his
last
shred
of
hope
vanished
he
made
his
way
to
a
bridge
where
he
had
often
watched
for
coming
and
with
a
prayer
flung
himself
into
the
turbid
stream
beneath
meanwhile
the
unceasing
cruelty
to
which
adeline
had
been
subjected
had
reduced
her
to
a
state
of
terrified
submission
so
that
scarce
knowing
what
she
did
she
consented
to
wed
siegebert
at
length
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
ceremony
the
bells
were
ringing
gaily
the
feast
was
spread
and
the
bride
arrayed
in
her
wedding
dress
unseen
she
slipped
out
by
a
little
postern
gate
and
made
her
way
quickly
to
the
hut
of
her
shepherd
alas
it
stood
empty
in
despair
she
ran
hither
and
thither
calling
his
name
in
anguished
accents
suddenly
she
espied
some
shepherds
endeavouring
to
draw
something
out
of
the
water
a
strange
instinct
told
her
the
truth
and
she
crept
closer
to
the
little
group
one
glance
sufficed
to
show
her
that
it
was
her
corpse
which
was
being
taken
ashore
no
need
to
ask
how
he
had
perished
or
why
with
a
wild
cry
she
flung
herself
into
the
stream
where
otto
had
met
his
death
and
was
speedily
overwhelmed
the
bridal
party
sought
high
and
low
for
the
bride
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
bodo
loudly
vented
his
indignation
at
his
rebelliousness
but
his
anger
was
changed
to
mourning
when
the
body
of
the
drowned
maiden
was
washed
ashore
a
few
days
later
too
late
he
repented
him
of
his
rash
folly
all
his
lamentations
could
not
restore
poor
adeline
to
life
he
caused
the
lovers
to
be
buried
together
and
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
prayer
and
penitence

the
best
of
which
are
the
following
the
poacher
of

in
the
city
of
stands
a
tower
and
in
the
midst
of
one
of
these
points
is
a
vane
containing
nine
round
holes
forming
the
figure
the
origin
of
this
figure
is
as
follows
a
notorious
poacher
lay
in
the
tower
condemned
to
death
for
numerous
offences
against
the
stringent
of
the
country
he
awaited
his
end
in
silence
and
sat
moodily
unobservant
of
the
bright
rays
of
the
sun
which
poured
into
his
cell
through
the
grated
window
others
he
pondered
were
basking
in
the
joyous
light
outside
yonder
in
the
verdant
summer
fields
whilst
he
who
even
now
felt
the
noose
tighten
round
his
neck
was
plunged
in
well
as
darkness
was
to
be
his
element
he
might
as
well
make
present
use
of
it
for
its
special
aid
sleep
especially
as
sleep
would
remove
him
for
the
time
being
from
gloomy
contemplation
upon
his
approaching
end
as
he
slept
a
pleasant
smile
took
the
place
of
the
sombre
expression
natural
to
his
waking
moments
but
on
a
sudden
he
started
in
his
slumber
grating
his
teeth
his
face
transformed
with
violent
rage
villain
that
was
a
trap
he
muttered
but
almost
immediately
his
countenance
resumed
the
sad
expression
which
had
lately
become
habitual
to
it
in
the
course
of
a
few
moments
however
this
gave
way
to
a
look
of
resolution
and
conscious
strength
and
even
in
sleep
he
appeared
to
have
made
up
his
mind
unalterably
upon
some
matter
of
importance
at
this
juncture
the
turnkey
entered
the
cell
accompanied
by
two
officials
one
of
whom
read
to
him
a
missive
from
those
in
authority
which
stated
that
a
petition
for
mercy
which
he
had
made
could
not
be
entertained
and
that
he
must
suffer
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
protest
against
such
a
sentence
cried
the
poacher
after
all
i
have
only
killed
those
animals
which
were
given
us
by
god
for
our
common
use
would
you
forfeit
the
life
of
a
man
because
he
has
slain
the
beasts
of
chase
is
not
the
only
charge
against
you
retorted
one
of
the
officials
harshly
comrades
as
well
as
the
honourable
company
of
foresters
accuse
you
of
being
in
league
with
the
enemy
of
mankind
and
of
procuring
from
him
charmed
the
poacher
laughed
is
false
he
cried

jealous
because
i
am
such
a
good
shot
provide
me
with
a
gun
and
with
powder
and
shot
blessed
by
a
priest
and
i
will
undertake
to
place
through
the
vane
of
this
tower
nine
shots
which
shall
form
the
figure
an
opportunity
shall
be
afforded
you
said
one
of
the
officials
who
had
not
as
yet
spoken
would
be
an
injustice
not
to
give
you
such
a
chance
especially
as
if
you
are
successful
you
will
remove
the
most
odious
portion
of
the
charge
against
the
news
of
the
challenge
spread
quickly
through
frankfort
and
even
the
foresters
who
had
given
evidence
against
him
were
so
impressed
that
they
forced
their
way
into
the
council
and
insisted
that
should
he
be
successful
a
free
pardon
should
be
granted
to
him
to
this
the
council
agreed
and
an
intimation
of
the
decision
was
conveyed
to
the
poacher
but
he
was
assured
that
if
one
bullet
missed
its
mark
he
would
certainly
die
to
this
he
agreed
and
the
succeeding
day
was
fixed
for
the
trial
of
skill
at
an
early
hour
the
square
in
which
the
tower
was
situated
was
thronged
by
an
immense
crowd
the
walls
of
the
city
of
which
the
tower
was
a
part
were
thronged
by
members
of
the
guild
soon
the
prisoner
was
led
forth
and
was
publicly
admonished
by
a
monk
not
to
tempt
god
if
his
skill
had
its
origin
in
diabolic
agencies
but
to
all
such
exhortations
the
poacher
replied
not
i
will
write
my
answer
upon
yonder
the
master
of
the
guild
loaded
the
gun
and
handed
it
to
him
amidst
a
deep
silence
he
aimed
at
the
vane
and
fired
the
shot
found
its
mark
once
more
he
fired
again
the
vane
swung
round
and
another
hole
appeared
therein
the
crowd
vented
its
feelings
by
loud
huzzahs
nine
times
did
he
fire
and
nine
times
did
the
bullet
hit
its
mark
and
as
the
last
bullet
sang
through
the
the
figure
showed
clearly
therein
and
the
poacher
sinking
to
his
knees
bared
his
head
and
gave
thanks
for
his
life
to
god
all
there
also
bared
their
heads
and
accompanied
him
in
his
thanksgiving
that
night
loaded
with
gifts
he
quitted
frankfort
nevermore
to
return
but
the
vane
on
the
tower
remains
there
to
this
day
as
a
witness
of
his
prowess
with
the
long
rifle
the
knave
of
bergen
the
city
of
frankfort
was
once
the
scene
of
a
great
coronation
festival
during
the
course
of
which
a
bal
masqué
was
given
by
the
king
and
queen
to
a
brilliant
assembly
of
ladies
and
nobles
the
knights
and
princes
in
their
fancy
costumes
were
hardly
less
resplendent
than
the
ladies
in
their
jewels
and
brocaded
silks
and
the
masks
they
all
wore
added
to
the
excitement
and
gaiety
of
the
scene
in
all
the
gathering
there
was
but
one
sombre
knight
in
armour
visored
of
great
stature
and
stately
in
motion
his
graceful
mien
won
the
admiration
of
the
ladies
and
the
envy
of
the
gallants
and
the
question
of
his
identity
excited
much
speculation
with
courtly
air
the
black
knight
approached
the
queen
knelt
before
her
and
begged
that
she
would
deign
to
be
his
partner
in
the
dance
the
charm
of
his
voice
and
the
modest
yet
dignified
manner
in
which
he
proffered
his
request
so
touched
the
queen
that
she
stepped
down
from
the
dais
and
joined
in
the
waltz
never
had
she
known
a
dancer
with
a
lighter
step
or
a
more
delightful
gift
of
conversation
when
that
dance
was
over
she
granted
him
another
and
yet
another
till
the
company
became
very
curious
to
know
who
the
gallant
knight
might
be
on
whom
the
queen
bestowed
her
favours
with
such
a
lavish
hand
at
last
the
time
came
for
the
guests
to
unmask
and
the
dancers
made
themselves
known
to
each
one
exception
that
is
for
the
black
knight
refused
to
lift
his
visor
the
king
and
queen
however
shared
to
the
full
the
curiosity
of
their
guests
as
to
the
identity
of
their
strange
guest
and
they
commanded
him
to
uncover
his
face
whereupon
the
knight
raised
his
visor
though
with
some
reluctance
neither
the
royal
hosts
nor
any
of
the
noble
guests
recognized
him
but
a
moment
later
two
officials
of
the
court
advanced
and
to
the
astonishment
and
indignation
of
the
company
declared
that
the
stranger
was
no
other
than
the
executioner
of
bergen
the
wrath
knew
no
bounds
he
commanded
that
the
knave
should
be
seized
and
put
to
death
immediately
to
think
that
he
had
allowed
the
queen
to
dance
with
a
common
executioner
the
bare
idea
was
intolerable
the
knave
fell
humbly
on
his
knees
before
his
irate
sovereign
acknowledge
my
crime
sire
he
said
your
majesty
must
be
aware
that
even
my
death
would
not
be
sufficient
to
wipe
out
my
disgrace
and
the
disgrace
of
her
majesty
who
has
danced
with
an
executioner
there
is
one
other
way
to
efface
my
guilt
and
to
wipe
out
the
humiliation
of
your
gracious
consort
you
must
make
a
knight
of
me
sire
and
i
will
challenge
to
mortal
combat
any
who
dares
to
speak
ill
of
my
king
the
king
was
astounded
by
this
bold
proposition
but
the
very
audacity
of
it
caught
his
fancy
he
struck
the
executioner
gently
with
his
sword
sir
knight
he
said
adding
as
the
black
knight
rose
to
his
feet
have
acted
like
a
knave
this
night
henceforth
you
shall
be
called
the
knave
of
darmstadt
the
proxy
in
the
days
of
chivalry
there
dwelt
in
birbach
a
knight
named
walther
no
less
renowned
for
his
piety
than
for
his
skill
in
arms
and
the
virgin
according
to
the
following
legend
was
not
unmindful
of
her
humble
worshipper
a
great
runs
the
to
take
place
in
darmstadt
and
sir
walther
who
was
about
to
enter
the
lists
for
the
first
time
was
not
feeling
confident
as
to
the
issue
he
knew
that
there
were
to
be
present
many
knights
whose
strength
and
skill
far
exceeded
his
own
and
brave
though
he
was
he
could
not
but
recognize
that
his
chances
of
victory
were
small
yet
he
felt
that
he
dared
not
suffer
defeat
he
must
not
be
disgraced
before
the
spectators
in
particular
there
was
a
certain
fair
lady
whose
colours
he
wore
he
must
not
be
shamed
before
her
his
mind
as
he
rode
on
his
way
to
darmstadt
was
filled
with
conflicting
emotions
love
hope
fear
shame
in
turn
dominating
his
thoughts
suddenly
he
came
to
a
wayside
altar
upon
which
was
set
an
image
of
the
virgin
and
he
decided
to
carry
his
troubles
to
her
as
he
was
wont
to
do
so
he
descended
from
his
horse
which
he
secured
to
a
tree
and
made
his
way
to
the
altar
so
deep
were
his
emotions
and
so
ardent
his
prayer
that
he
passed
into
a
sort
of
trance
and
fell
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
like
one
dead
while
he
lay
thus
unconscious
the
virgin
descended
from
the
altar
unlaced
his
armour
and
donned
it
herself
then
taking
sword
and
shield
and
lance
she
mounted
his
steed
and
rode
into
darmstadt
she
was
absent
for
some
time
but
when
she
returned
the
knight
still
lay
in
the
state
in
which
she
had
left
him
she
tied
his
horse
once
more
to
the
tree
replaced
his
armour
and
then
took
her
accustomed
place
on
the
altar
shortly
after
walther
recovered
consciousness
and
rose
hastily
then
after
another
prayer
to
the
virgin
he
rode
as
quickly
as
he
might
into
the
town
here
to
his
intense
surprise
he
was
greeted
with
joyful
shouts
and
congratulations
his
friends
hailed
him
as
a
mighty
champion
and
she
who
had
won
his
affections
bestowed
upon
him
the
reward
of
knightly
promise
of
marriage
the
bewildered
walther
scarce
knew
whether
he
was
awake
or
asleep
but
at
length
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
someone
had
won
great
triumphs
in
his
name
who
could
have
so
successfully
personated
him
as
to
deceive
even
his
dearest
friends
who
indeed
save
she
to
whom
he
had
turned
in
his
distress
the
holy
virgin
herself
soon
he
was
wedded
to
the
lady
of
his
choice
and
to
show
his
gratitude
for
the
intervention
of
mary
he
built
her
a
magnificent
chapel
on
the
spot
where
the
miracle
had
taken
place
nor
did
he
grow
any
less
diligent
in
her
service
but
continued
to
live
a
noble
and
pious
life
in
which
he
was
ever
encouraged
and
assisted
by
his
wife
the
cooper
of
auerbach
it
is
said
that
from
the
ruined
castle
of
auerbach
a
fragrant
perfume
of
wine
sometimes
steals
upon
the
air
and
then
the
country
folk
whisper
cooper
is
tasting
his
and
if
asked
for
the
reason
of
this
saying
they
tell
the
following
story
once
when
the
sun
shone
golden
on
the
hills
deepening
the
heavy
clusters
of
grapes
to
a
darker
purple
a
peasant
passing
by
the
ruins
thought
longingly
upon
the
wine
that
in
the
past
had
been
stored
in
those
dark
cool
cellars
wondering
if
perhaps
some
might
not
yet
be
found
there
or
if
all
had
been
wasted
and
lost
and
while
he
yet
pondered
a
rubicund
little
man
with
leathern
apron
dark
with
girded
about
his
portly
waist
stood
at
his
side
looking
up
at
him
with
twinkling
eyes
my
friend
you
think
upon
the
wine
eh
come
and
spend
an
hour
with
me
and
you
shall
taste
as
he
spoke
a
warm
sweet
rose
like
incense
about
him
making
the
brain
reel
with
delight
he
could
not
but
follow
the
little
man
tripping
under
the
vines
thrusting
his
way
through
and
over
crumbling
walls
till
he
came
to
a
flight
of
ancient
steps
streaked
grey
and
green
with
moss
leading
down
to
a
the
door
opened
into
dusky
vaults
and
from
a
niche
in
the
wall
the
little
cooper
took
a
candle
and
a
huge
bowl
then
on
he
went
over
the
moist
floor
until
there
rose
before
them
in
the
candlelight
darker
than
the
gloom
about
it
a
gigantic
tun
in
a
crooning
murmur
the
cooper
began
to
tell
of
his
possessions
he
called
the
vaults
his
realm
the
tuns
his
dearly
loved
as
the
peasant
gazed
he
saw
a
long
procession
of
tuns
stretching
away
into
the
darkness
he
shouted
with
mad
delight
at
the
sight
he
clapped
his
hands
and
smacked
his
lips
in
anticipation
he
declared
the
tuns
glittered
like
pure
gold
at
this
the
cooper
laughed
and
pointed
out
that
the
wine
had
fashioned
its
own
casks
gleaming
crusts
from
which
the
ancient
wood
had
fallen
away
long
ago
and
next
he
filled
the
huge
bowl
with
deep
glowing
wine
and
drank
to
the
peasant
whose
hands
ached
to
hold
the
bowl
and
lift
it
to
his
lips
at
last
with
a
courtly
bow
the
cooper
put
it
into
his
hands
and
then
the
rustic
emptied
the
bowl
in
one
draught
and
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
in
rapture
he
sang
the
praises
of
the
wine
but
the
cooper
assured
him
that
there
was
better
to
come
again
he
tasted
and
again
the
little
man
led
on
from
cask
to
cask
then
mad
with
delight
the
peasant
sang
aloud
but
the
song
broke
into
wild
howling
he
danced
about
the
tuns
then
fell
to
embracing
them
stroking
and
kissing
them
babbling
to
the
dusky
fragrant
wine
and
still
the
cooper
led
on
to
the
next
cask
still
he
filled
the
bowl
and
still
the
peasant
drank
till
at
last
in
very
joy
tears
ran
down
his
face
and
before
his
eyes
the
tuns
danced
round
him
in
a
giddy
whirl
then
slumber
fell
upon
him
and
he
sank
down
to
sleep
in
the
gloom
when
he
awoke
next
morning
his
body
lay
stretched
in
a
muddy
ditch
his
lips
pressed
to
clammy
moss
stumbling
to
his
feet
he
looked
around
for
the
door
of
the
wine
vault
for
the
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
that
realm
of
delight
but
though
he
searched
long
and
carefully
yet
never
again
could
he
find
it
nor
did
his
eyes
see
the
little
cooper
with
his
leathern
apron
and
his
rubicund
face
chapter
and
the
nibelungenlied
worms
is
celebrated
as
the
locality
of
the
nibelungenlied
and
the
epic
of
walthar
of
aquitaine
but
it
has
other
claims
to
fame
before
entering
on
the
consideration
of
greatest
epic
we
will
recount
several
of
the
lesser
legends
of
the
locality
the
rose
garden
a
tale
of
dietrich
of
bern
dietrich
of
bern
is
the
king
arthur
of
german
story
like
his
prototype
of
britain
he
has
become
the
central
figure
of
innumerable
medieval
tales
and
epics
a
model
of
chivalry
and
martial
prowess
distinguished
everywhere
by
high
deeds
and
mighty
feats
of
arms
and
in
not
a
few
cases
displacing
the
rightful
hero
of
still
older
myths
which
thus
became
grafted
on
to
the
dietrich
legends
originally
he
was
a
historical
personage
theodoric
the
ostrogoth
and
as
such
gained
a
widespread
popularity
among
his
people
his
historical
character
however
was
soon
lost
in
the
maze
of
legendary
lore
which
surrounded
his
name
and
which
as
time
went
on
ascribed
to
him
feats
ever
more
wildly
heroic
among
the
various
traditions
there
is
one
relating
to
the
rhenish
town
of
worms
which
calls
for
inclusion
here
as
much
on
account
of
its
intrinsic
merit
as
because
of
its
undoubted
popularity
the
legend
of
the
rose
garden
of
worms
is
a
quaint
and
fanciful
tale
and
even
the
circumstance
that
it
ends
with
the
death
of
several
good
knights
and
true
does
not
rob
it
of
a
certain
humorous
quality
it
possesses
by
the
time
dietrich
had
reached
the
prime
of
his
adventurous
runs
the
had
gathered
a
considerable
company
of
doughty
paladins
at
his
formed
in
fact
a
kind
of
round
the
knights
who
composed
it
were
as
eager
as
their
lord
to
seek
fresh
fields
wherein
to
display
their
prowess
and
were
second
only
to
him
in
skill
and
valour
among
them
were
numbered
such
illustrious
warriors
as
herbrand
his
son
hildebrand
eckehart
wolfhart
and
amelung
on
one
occasion
as
dietrich
was
seated
at
table
with
his
followers
he
vowed
that
no
court
in
christendom
could
boast
of
such
warriors
as
he
could
muster
the
assembled
knights
greeted
the
assertion
with
hearty
that
is
save
the
old
warrior
herbrand
and
he
was
silent
dietrich
looked
at
him
in
surprise
thou
nothing
to
say
herbrand
he
asked
thou
to
find
better
knights
than
these
his
followers
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
herbrand
seemed
somewhat
reluctant
to
uphold
his
tacit
objection
to
claim
he
said
at
length
are
such
warriors
to
be
where
may
we
seek
such
paragons
inquired
the
king
none
too
well
pleased
the
town
of
worms
replied
the
old
knight
lies
a
wondrous
rose
garden
of
great
extent
where
the
queen
and
her
ladies
take
their
pleasure
none
save
these
may
enter
its
precincts
unless
the
queen
give
him
leave
and
that
the
sacred
boundaries
may
not
be
overstepped
twelve
warriors
are
set
to
guard
the
garth
such
is
their
strength
and
courage
that
none
has
ever
succeeded
in
passing
them
whatever
his
skill
and
wherefore
should
one
seek
to
pass
the
guard
asked
a
young
knight
there
a
prize
to
be
won
then
sighed
old
herbrand
would
not
give
a
hair
of
my
head
for
the
prize
but
a
crown
of
roses
and
a
kiss
from
one
of
the
ladies
though
it
is
said
indeed
that
they
are
as
lovely
as
women
may
there
no
fair
maids
in
bern
cried
the
warriors
indignantly
we
go
to
the
rhine
for
them
myself
said
dietrich
care
little
for
the
reward
yet
methinks
that
for
the
honour
and
glory
i
would
meet
these
doughty
warriors
and
peradventure
overcome
them
who
will
follow
me
to
burgundy
as
with
one
voice
his
knights
responded
to
his
appeal
and
he
chose
eight
from
among
them
to
accompany
him
on
his
quest
as
there
were
still
but
nine
including
dietrich
himself
to
meet
the
twelve
guardians
of
the
rose
garden
the
king
decided
to
send
for
three
knights
who
were
absent
from
the
court
at
the
suggestion
of
hildebrand
he
selected
rüdiger
of
bechlarn
dietleib
of
styria
and
ilsan
who
was
brother
to
hildebrand
and
at
that
time
a
monk
in
the
monastery
of
munchenzell
rüdiger
was
margrave
to
king
etzel
and
had
to
obtain
his
permission
to
venture
forth
on
the
romantic
undertaking
father
strongly
recommended
that
the
quest
be
abandoned
though
the
youth
himself
was
as
eager
as
any
to
accompany
dietrich
while
as
for
ilsan
he
found
it
especially
difficult
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
for
naturally
his
abbot
deemed
the
enterprise
a
strange
one
for
a
monk
who
had
fled
all
earthly
delights
however
all
difficulties
were
eventually
overcome
and
when
the
party
was
ready
for
departure
rüdiger
was
sent
on
an
embassy
to
king
gibich
at
worms
to
prepare
him
for
their
coming
gibich
gave
his
ready
consent
to
the
proposed
trial
of
strength
whereupon
the
warriors
set
out
for
the
rhine
to
see
whether
they
might
not
win
a
kiss
and
a
garland
from
some
fair
lady
an
imposing
array
did
the
knights
of
the
rose
garden
make
as
they
awaited
the
approach
of
the
strangers
but
no
less
imposing
were
dietrich
and
his
warriors
each
chose
an
opponent
and
immediately
engaged
in
a
fierce
struggle
which
was
to
end
disastrously
for
more
than
one
brave
knight
the
first
to
dispatch
his
antagonist
was
wolfhart
who
submitted
to
being
crowned
with
a
but
disdained
to
accept
the
rest
of
the
reward
the
monk
who
was
the
next
victor
took
the
roses
and
kissed
the
maiden
heartily
but
alas
a
bristly
beard
covered
his
chin
and
the
maid
was
left
ruefully
rubbing
her
pouting
lips
one
by
one
knights
overcame
their
adversaries
some
of
whom
were
slain
and
some
wounded
toward
nightfall
a
truce
was
called
and
dietrich
and
his
company
set
out
to
return
to
bern
well
satisfied
with
having
disproved
the
assertion
of
herbrand
that
there
were
better
warriors
in
the
world
than
dietrich
and
his
noble
company
the
vineyard
there
is
a
curious
legend
told
to
account
for
the
excellent
quality
of
the
wine
of
worms
an
old
nobleman
who
at
one
time
lived
in
that
neighbourhood
was
in
the
habit
of
drinking
more
of
the
rhenish
wine
than
was
good
for
him
in
every
other
respect
he
was
a
most
worthy
man
kind
generous
and
pious
his
piety
in
an
age
when
such
qualities
were
rare
roused
the
ire
of
the
devil
who
determined
to
bring
about
his
fall
and
as
the
old
love
of
wine
was
his
only
serious
weakness
it
was
through
this
that
the
fiend
set
himself
to
compass
the
destruction
the
devil
therefore
disguised
himself
as
a
strolling
musician
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
old
man
the
latter
set
before
him
some
of
the
wine
of
the
country
extolling
meanwhile
its
rare
qualities
the
guest
seemed
not
at
all
impressed
by
the
recital
but
spoke
of
a
wine
which
he
had
tasted
in
the
south
and
which
far
surpassed
any
other
vintage
the
nobleman
was
all
curiosity
the
stranger
talked
of
the
wonderful
wine
with
feigned
reluctance
and
at
length
his
host
promised
to
give
him
anything
he
should
ask
if
only
he
would
fetch
him
some
of
the
wine
satan
promised
to
plant
a
vineyard
in
worms
asking
in
exchange
the
soul
of
his
host
to
be
forfeited
at
the
end
of
a
fixed
period
to
this
the
old
man
consented
and
the
strolling
musician
planted
a
vineyard
which
sprang
up
as
though
by
magic
when
the
first
vintage
was
produced
it
was
found
to
be
delicious
beyond
the
dreams
of
the
old
nobleman
who
was
indeed
a
connoisseur
in
wines
in
his
delight
he
christened
the
wine
liebfrauenmilch
signifying
of
our
blessed
the
devil
was
furious
at
this
reference
to
the
holy
virgin
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
in
due
course
the
soul
would
be
his
but
the
virgin
herself
was
pleased
with
the
christening
of
the
vineyard
and
rather
sorry
for
the
foolish
old
nobleman
who
had
bartered
his
soul
for
the
wine
when
therefore
the
time
arrived
for
the
evil
one
to
claim
his
fee
she
sent
her
angels
to
drive
him
away
and
thus
he
was
robbed
of
his
prey
the
old
man
having
learned
the
danger
of
treating
with
the
devil
now
built
a
chapel
to
the
virgin
in
his
vineyard
he
lived
for
a
long
time
to
enjoy
the
luscious
wine
under
the
protection
of
the
saints
and
never
again
did
he
make
a
compact
with
satan
now
if
anyone
requires
a
proof
of
this
marvellous
story
is
there
not
the
liebfrauenmilch
most
delicious
of
wines
to
convince
him
of
its
truth
the
caprice
in
the
town
of
worms
there
stands
an
old
manor
built
in
the
style
of
the
renaissance
and
known
as
the
wampolder
hof
at
one
time
it
belonged
to
the
lord
of
wampold
a
wealthy
noble
of
mainz
who
had
appointed
as
castellan
a
kinsman
of
his
himself
a
nobleman
though
landless
and
poor
and
no
longer
able
to
uphold
his
former
dignities
in
his
youth
the
keeper
had
lived
a
gay
and
careless
life
but
now
he
was
old
and
infirm
and
cared
no
longer
for
worldly
vanities
his
sole
pride
was
his
young
daughter
a
bewitching
maiden
who
had
more
lovers
than
one
could
readily
count
and
who
smiled
upon
them
all
impartially
with
so
many
lovelorn
youths
at
her
beck
and
call
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
she
should
grow
exacting
and
capricious
but
this
as
usually
happens
only
made
them
love
her
the
more
there
was
one
among
her
suitors
however
for
whom
she
cherished
a
real
affection
handsome
cultured
and
like
herself
of
noble
birth
he
was
notwithstanding
his
poverty
by
far
the
most
eligible
of
the
youths
who
sought
her
in
marriage
and
the
castellan
readily
granted
his
consent
to
their
betrothal
so
for
a
time
everything
seemed
to
indicate
happiness
in
store
for
the
young
couple
yet
the
maiden
remained
as
capricious
as
ever
on
when
a
party
of
lads
and
lasses
were
gathered
in
the
wampolder
hof
and
tales
of
witches
and
witchcraft
were
being
told
in
hushed
tones
she
conceived
a
wild
scheme
to
test
her
affection
she
bade
him
go
to
the
at
midnight
watch
the
procession
of
witches
and
return
to
tell
her
what
he
saw
the
awed
company
protested
vigorously
against
the
proposed
test
but
the
girl
persisted
and
at
last
her
lover
seeing
that
she
was
already
piqued
at
his
refusal
laughingly
set
out
for
the
bewitched
spot
convinced
that
no
harm
would
befall
him
meantime
the
company
in
the
manor
anxiously
awaited
his
return
one
came
then
still
there
was
no
sign
of
him
glances
of
horror
and
pity
were
cast
at
the
daughter
who
now
wrung
her
hands
in
futile
grief
at
length
a
few
braver
spirits
volunteered
to
go
in
search
of
their
comrade
but
no
trace
of
him
could
they
find
his
widowed
mother
of
whom
he
had
been
the
only
son
cursed
the
maid
who
was
the
cause
of
his
ghastly
fate
and
not
long
afterward
the
daughter
lost
her
reason
and
died
on
she
may
still
be
heard
in
worms
calling
for
her
lost
lover
whom
she
is
destined
never
to
find
the
fate
of
the
youth
remains
uncertain
the
most
popular
account
is
that
he
was
torn
limb
from
limb
by
the
infuriated
witches
and
his
remains
scattered
to
the
winds
but
some
less
superstitious
than
their
neighbours
declared
that
he
had
been
murdered
by
his
rivals
the
disappointed
suitors
and
that
his
body
had
been
cast
into
the
not
long
afterward
a
corpse
which
might
have
been
that
of
the
missing
youth

drawn
from
the
river
by
fishermen
the
nibelungenlied
the
greatest
rhine
story
of
all
is
that
wondrous
german
iliad
the
nibelungenlied
for
it
is
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
in
the
ancient
city
of
worms
that
its
action
for
the
most
part
takes
place
the
earliest
actual
form
of
the
epic
is
referred
to
the
first
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
it
is
probable
that
a
latin
original
founded
on
ballads
or
was
in
use
about
the
middle
or
latter
end
of
the
tenth
century
the
work
despite
many
medieval
interpolations
and
the
manifest
liberties
of
generations
of
bards
and
minnesingers
bears
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
a
great
antiquity
a
whole
literature
has
grown
up
around
this
mighty
epic
of
old
germanic
life
and
men
of
vast
scholarship
and
literary
acumen
have
made
it
a
veritable
of
conflicting
theories
one
contending
for
its
mythical
genesis
another
proving
to
his
satisfaction
that
it
is
founded
upon
historic
fact
whilst
others
dispute
hotly
as
to
its
germanic
or
scandinavian
origin
so
numerous
are
the
conflicting
opinions
concerning
the
origin
of
the
nibelungenlied
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
present
to
the
reader
a
reasoned
examination
of
the
whole
without
entering
rather
deeply
into
philological
and
mythical
considerations
of
considerable
complexity
we
shall
therefore
confine
ourselves
to
the
main
points
of
these
controversies
and
refrain
from
entering
upon
the
more
puzzling
bypaths
which
are
only
to
be
trodden
by
the
of
the
study
as
they
have
been
called
its
original
form
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
karl
lachmann
a
philologist
of
some
repute
put
forward
the
theory
that
the
poem
was
made
up
of
a
number
of
distinct
ballads
or
lays
and
he
eliminated
from
it
all
parts
which
appeared
to
him
to
be
interpolations
this
reduced
the
whole
to
twenty
lays
which
he
considered
the
work
of
twenty
separate
minstrels
but
if
certain
ballads
relating
to
episodes
in
the
nibelungenlied
once
existed
in
germany
it
is
the
spirit
of
these
more
than
the
matter
which
is
incorporated
into
the
great
epic
in
medieval
times
when
the
nibelungenlied
story
was
popular
minnesingers
and
harpers
in
an
attempt
to
please
their
audiences
would
cast
about
for
fresh
incidents
to
introduce
into
the
story
popular
as
was
the
tale
even
a
medieval
audience
could
tire
of
the
exploits
of
its
dramatis
personae
and
the
minstrel
dependent
upon
their
goodwill
for
bed
and
board
would
be
quick
to
note
when
the
tale
fell
flat
accordingly
he
would
attempt
to
infuse
into
it
some
new
incident
or
series
of
incidents
culled
from
other
stories
more
often
than
not
such
an
interpolation
is
probably
to
be
noted
in
the
presence
of
dietrich
of
bern
otherwise
theodoric
the
ostrogoth
at
the
court
of
etzel
or
attila
to
say
nothing
of
the
probability
of
anachronism
geographical
conditions
are
not
a
little
outraged
in
the
adoption
of
this
incident
but
the
question
arose
who
was
to
worst
the
mighty
hagen
whose
sombre
figure
dominates
in
its
gloomy
grandeur
the
latter
part
of
the
saga
it
would
not
do
for
any
hunnish
champion
to
vie
successfully
with
the
burgundian
hero
but
it
would
be
no
disgrace
for
him
to
be
beaten
by
dietrich
the
greatest
champion
of
antiquity
who
in
fact
is
more
than
once
dragged
into
the
pages
of
romance
for
the
purpose
of
administering
an
honourable
defeat
to
a
hitherto
unconquered
champion
we
can
thus
see
how
novel
and
subsidiary
passages
might
attach
themselves
to
the
epic
but
a
day
came
when
the
minnesingers
of
germany
felt
that
it
behoved
them
to
fix
once
and
for
all
time
the
shape
of
the
lay
of
the
nibelungs
indeed
not
one
but
several
poets
laboured
at
this
task
that
they
worked
with
materials
immediately
to
their
hand
is
seen
from
the
circumstance
that
we
have
proof
of
a
low
german
account
and
a
rhenish
version
which
was
evidently
moulded
into
its
present
shape
by
an
austrian
or
tyrolese
singer
well
versed
in
court
poetry
and
courtly
etiquette
the
date
when
the
nibelungenlied
received
its
latest
form
was
probably
about
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
and
this
last
version
was
the
immediate
source
of
our
present
manuscripts
the
date
of
the
earliest
known
manuscript
of
the
nibelungenlied
is
comparatively
late
we
possess
in
all
more
or
less
complete
manuscripts
preserved
in
fragments
fifteen
of
which
date
from
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
its
fragmentary
nature
even
a
surface
examination
is
sufficient
to
testify
to
the
fragmentary
nature
of
the
nibelungenlied
we
can
discern
through
the
apparent
unity
of
texture
of
the
work
as
we
now
possess
it
the
patchwork
where
scribe
or
minstrel
has
interpolated
this
incident
or
joined
together
these
passages
to
secure
the
necessary
unity
of
narrative
moreover
in
none
of
the
several
versions
of
the
siegfried
epic
do
we
get
the
one
supplements
another
and
while
we
shall
follow
the
nibelungenlied
itself
as
closely
as
possible
we
shall
in
part
supplement
it
from
other
kindred
sources

care
to
indicate
these
where
we
find
it
necessary

introduce

clouds
as
he
beheld
her
his
heart
was
soothed
and
all
his
trouble
vanished
for
there
stood
she
who
had
cost
him
many
a
her
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
brighter
than
the
rich
jewels
which
covered
her
raiment
her
cheeks
suffused
with
the
blushes
of
maidenhood
no
one
had
he
thought
ever
seen
so
much
beauty
before
as
the
silver
moon
obscures
the
light
of
the
stars
by
its
superior
splendour
so
did
kriemhild
obscure
the
beauty
of
the
ladies
who
surrounded
her
when
he
beheld
her
each
hero
drew
himself
up
more
proudly
than
ever
and
appeared
as
if
ready
to
do
battle
for
such
a
paragon
of
beauty
she
was
preceded
by
chamberlains
in
rich
attire
but
no
ushers
might
keep
back
the
knights
from
sight
of
her
and
they
crowded
about
her
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
pleased
and
sad
was
siegfried
for
thought
he
may
i
ever
hope
to
win
so
peerless
a
creature
the
hope
is
a
rash
one
better
were
i
to
forget
then
alas
my
heart
would
have
ceased
to
beat
and
i
should
be
dead
pale
and
red
he
grew
he
recked
not
of
his
own
great
worth
for
all
there
agreed
that
so
handsome
a
warrior
had
never
come
to
the
rhineland
so
fair
of
body
so
debonair
was
he
the
wooing
of
brunhild
siegfried
now
resolved
to
win
kriemhild
and
on
asking
him
to
accompany
him
on
an
adventure
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
gain
the
hand
of
queen
brunhild
of
isenstein
he
accepted
on
condition
that
on
their
return
he
should
be
rewarded
by
the
hand
of
his
sister
to
this
gunther
gave
assent
and
they
set
out
accompanied
by
hagen
and
his
brother
dankwart
but
the
nibelungenlied
proper
is
silent
regarding
previous
relations
with
brunhild
in
scandinavian
as
the
volsunga
saga
where
this
legend
originally
a
german
one
is
preserved
in
its
pagan
was
a
valkyr
or
of
odin
who
sent
her
to
sleep
with
a
prick
of
a
magic
thorn
and
imprisoned
her
within
a
circle
of
flame
through
which
siegfried
in
this
version
almost
certainly
the
god
of
nature
springtide
and
the
sun
broke
delivered
the
captive
and
took
her
as
his
bride
soon
however
departing
from
her
in
the
nibelungenlied
this
ancient
myth
is
either
presupposed
or
intentionally
omitted
as
unfitting
for
consumption
by
a
christianized
folk
but
it
is
hinted
that
brunhild
had
a
previous
claim
upon
affections
brunhild
had
made
it
a
condition
that
the
hero
whom
she
would
wed
must
be
able
to
overcome
her
in
three
trials
of
prowess
losing
his
head
as
a
penalty
of
failure
siegfried
donning
the
magic
cloak
of
invisibility
he
had
won
from
alberich
king
of
the
dwarfs
took
place
and
won
the
three
trials
for
him
gunther
going
through
a
pantomime
of
the
appropriate
actions
while
siegfried
performed
the
feats
the
passage
which
tells
of
the
encounter
is
curious
a
great
spear
heavy
and
keen
was
brought
forth
for
use
it
was
more
a
weapon
for
a
hero
of
might
than
for
a
maiden
but
unwieldy
as
it
was
she
was
able
to
brandish
it
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
willow
wand
three
and
a
half
weights
of
iron
went
to
the
making
of
this
mighty
spear
which
scarce
three
of
her
men
could
carry
sore
afraid
was
gunther
well
did
he
wish
him
safe
in
the
burgundian
land
back
in
rhineland
thought
he
i
would
not
stir
a
distance
to
win
any
such
but
up
spake
dankwart
valiant
brother
is
the
day
come
on
which
we
must
bid
farewell
to
our
lives
an
ill
journey
has
this
been
i
trow
for
in
this
land
we
shall
perish
at
the
hands
of
women
oh
that
my
brother
hagen
and
i
had
but
our
good
swords
here
then
would
these
carles
of
check
their
laughter
without
arms
a
man
can
do
nothing
but
had
i
a
blade
in
hand
even
brunhild
herself
should
die
ere
harm
came
to
our
dear
this
speech
heard
the
put
these
swords
into
their
hands
she
commanded
accoutre
them
in
their
right
glad
was
dankwart
to
feel
iron
in
his
hand
once
more
and
know
its
weight
upon
his
limbs
i
am
ready
for
such
play
as
they
list
he
cried
we
have
arms
our
lord
is
not
yet
into
the
ring
of
contest
mighty
men
bore
a
great
stone
twelve
of
them
it
took
to
carry
it
so
ponderous
it
was
woe
were
they
of
burgundy
for
their
lord
at
sight
of
the
same
brunhild
advanced
on
gunther
brandishing
her
spear
siegfried
was
by
his
side
and
touched
him
lightly
to
give
him
confidence
but
gunther
knew
not
it
was
he
and
marvelled
for
no
one
saw
him
there
hath
touched
me
said
he
i
siegfried
replied
his
friend
of
good
cheer
and
fear
not
the
maiden
give
me
thy
shield
and
mark
well
what
i
say
make
thou
motions
as
if
to
guard
and
strike
and
i
will
do
the
deeds
above
all
hearken
to
my
whispered
great
was
joy
when
he
knew
that
siegfried
was
by
him
but
he
had
not
long
to
marvel
for
brunhild
was
on
him
her
great
spear
in
hand
the
light
from
its
broad
blade
flashing
in
his
eyes
she
hurled
the
spear
at
his
shield
it
passed
through
the
iron
as
if
it
had
been
silk
and
struck
on
the
rings
of
armour
both
gunther
and
siegfried
staggered
at
the
blow
but
the
latter
although
bleeding
from
the
mouth
with
the
shock
of
the
thrown
weapon
seized
it
reversing
the
point
and
cast
it
at
brunhild
with
such
dreadful
might
that
when
it
rang
on
her
armour
she
was
overthrown
right
angry
was
brunhild
but
she
weened
that
the
blow
was
and
respected
him
for
his
strength
her
anger
however
overcame
her
esteem
and
seizing
the
great
stone
which
had
been
placed
in
the
ring
of
combat
she
cast
it
from
her
twelve
fathoms
leaping
after
it
she
sprang
farther
than
she
had
thrown
it
then
went
gunther
to
the
stone
and
poised
it
while
siegfried
threw
it
he
cast
the
stone
farther
than
brunhild
had
done
and
so
great
was
his
strength
that
he
raised
king
gunther
from
the
earth
and
leapt
with
him
a
greater
distance
than
brunhild
had
leapt
herself
men
saw
gunther
throw
and
leap
alone
red
with
anger
grew
brunhild
when
she
saw
herself
defeated
loudly
she
addressed
her
men
ye
liegemen
of
mine
she
cried
are
ye
subject
to
gunther
the
king
for
behold
he
has
beaten
me
in
the
the
knights
then
acclaimed
gunther
as
the
victor
by
his
own
strength
of
arm
had
he
won
the
games
said
they
and
he
in
turn
greeted
them
lovingly
brunhild
came
forward
took
him
by
the
hand
and
granted
to
him
full
power
throughout
her
dominions
they
proceeded
to
her
palace
and
warriors
were
now
regaled
with
better
cheer
than
before
but
siegfried
carefully
concealed
his
magic
cloak
coming
to
where
gunther
and
brunhild
sat
he
said
lord
why
do
you
tarry
why
are
the
games
of
which
queen
brunhild
doth
speak
not
yet
begun
i
long
to
see
how
they
may
be
he
acted
his
part
so
well
that
brunhild
really
believed
that
he
was
not
aware
the
games
were
over
and
that
she
was
the
loser
sir
siegfried
said
she
comes
it
that
you
were
not
present
when
the
games
which
gunther
has
won
were
being
played
hagen
fearing
that
siegfried
might
blunder
in
his
reply
took
the
answer
out
of
his
mouth
and
said
queen
the
good
knight
siegfried
was
hard
by
the
ship
when
gunther
won
the
games
from
you
naught
indeed
knew
he
of
siegfried
now
expressed
great
surprise
that
any
man
living
had
been
able
to
master
the
mighty
it
possible
he
exclaimed
it
possible
o
queen
that
you
have
been
vanquished
at
the
sports
in
which
you
excel
so
greatly
but
i
for
one
am
glad
since
now
you
needs
must
follow
us
home
to
the
are
speedy
of
speech
sir
siegfried
replied
brunhild
there
is
much
to
do
ere
yet
i
quit
my
lands
first
must
i
inform
my
kindred
and
vassals
of
this
thing
messengers
must
be
sent
to
many
of
my
kinsmen
ere
i
depart
from
with
that
she
bade
couriers
ride
to
all
quarters
bidding
her
kinsmen
her
friends
and
her
warriors
come
without
delay
to
isenstein
for
several
days
they
arrived
in
troops
early
and
late
they
came
singly
and
in
companies
then
with
a
large
escort
brunhild
sailed
across
the
sea
and
up
the
rhine
to
worms
siegfried
and
brunhild
it
now
became
increasingly
clear
that
siegfried
and
brunhild
had
had
affectionate
relations
in
the
past
indeed
in
the
volsunga
saga
which
is
an
early
version
of
the
nibelungenlied
we
find
grimhild
the
mother
of
gudrun
kriemhild
administering
to
sigurd
siegfried
a
magic
potion
in
order
that
he
should
forget
about
brunhild
on
seeing
siegfried
and
kriemhild
greet
each
other
with
a
kiss
sadness
and
jealousy
wrung
the
heart
of
the
and
she
evinced
anything
but
a
wifely
spirit
toward
her
husband
gunther
whom
on
the
first
night
of
their
wedded
life
she
wrestled
with
defeated
and
bound
with
her
girdle
afterward
hanging
him
up
by
it
on
a
peg
in
the
wall
next
day
he
appealed
to
siegfried
for
assistance
and
that
night
the
hero
donned
his
magic
cloak
of
invisibility
contended
with
brunhild
in
the
darkness
and
overcame
her
she
believing
him
to
be
gunther
who
was
present
during
the
strife
but
siegfried
was
foolish
enough
to
carry
away
her
ring
and
girdle
very
these
he
gave
to
kriemhild
and
sore
both
of
them
rued
it
in
strength
vanished
with
her
maidenhood
and
thenceforth
she
was
as
any
other
woman
siegfried
and
kriemhild
now
departed
to
the
capital
of
santen
on
the
lower
rhine
and
peace
prevailed
for
ten
years
until
brunhild
persuaded
gunther
to
invite
them
to
a
festival
at
worms
she
could
not
understand
how
if
siegfried
was
vassal
as
gunther
had
informed
her
he
neither
paid
tribute
nor
rendered
homage
the
invitation
was
accepted
cordially
enough
but
kriemhild
and
brunhild
quarrelled
bitterly
regarding
a
matter
of
precedence
as
to
who
should
first
enter
church
and
at
the
door
of
the
minster
of
worms
there
was
an
unseemly
squabble
then
kriemhild
taunted
brunhild
with
the
fact
that
siegfried
had
won
and
deserted
her
and
displayed
the
girdle
and
ring
as
proof
of
what
she
asserted
siegfried
confronted
with
brunhild
denied
that
he
had
ever
approached
her
in
any
unseemly
way
and
he
and
gunther
attempted
to
make
peace
between
their
wives
but
all
to
no
avail
a
deadly
feud
had
sprung
up
between
them
which
was
to
end
in
woe
for
all
hagen
swore
a
great
oath
that
siegfried
should
pay
for
the
insult
his
wife
had
put
upon
brunhild
the
plot
against
siegfried
now
but
four
days
after
news
came
to
court
that
war
was
declared
against
him
but
this
was
merely
a
plot
to
draw
siegfried
from
the
court
and
compass
his
death
the
heroes
armed
for
war
among
them
siegfried
when
hagen
bade
farewell
to
kriemhild
she
recommended
siegfried
to
his
care
now
when
siegfried
slew
the
dragon
which
guarded
the
treasure
of
the
nibelungs
he
bathed
in
its
blood
and
became
like
achilles
invulnerable
save
at
a
spot
where
a
linden
leaf
had
fallen
between
his
shoulders
as
he
bathed
and
so
prevented
contact
with
the
potent
stream
hagen
inquired
of
kriemhild
the
whereabouts
of
this
vulnerable
spot
pretending
that
he
would
guard
siegfried
against
treachery
in
battle
and
she
fully
believing
in
his
good
faith
sewed
a
silken
cross
upon
mantle
to
mark
the
place
on
the
following
morning
siegfried
with
a
thousand
knights
took
horse
and
rode
away
thinking
to
avenge
his
comrades
hagen
rode
beside
him
and
carefully
scanned
his
vesture
he
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
mark
and
having
done
so
he
dispatched
two
of
his
men
with
another
message
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
king
might
know
that
now
his
land
would
remain
at
peace
this
siegfried
was
loath
to
hear
for
he
would
have
done
battle
for
his
friends
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
vassals
could
hold
him
back
then
he
rode
to
gunther
who
thanked
him
warmly
for
having
so
quickly
granted
his
prayer
gunther
assured
him
that
if
need
be
he
would
at
any
time
come
to
his
aid
and
that
he
held
him
the
most
trusty
of
all
his
friends
he
pretended
to
be
so
glad
that
the
threat
of
war
was
past
that
he
suggested
that
they
should
ride
hunting
to
the
odenwald
after
the
bear
and
the
boar
as
they
had
so
often
done
before
this
was
the
counsel
of
the
false
hagen
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
start
early
for
the
greenwood
and
gunther
promised
to
lend
siegfried
several
dogs
that
knew
the
forest
ways
well
siegfried
then
hurried
home
to
his
wife
and
when
he
had
departed
hagen
and
the
king
took
counsel
together
after
they
had
agreed
upon
the
manner
in
which
they
would
compass
the
destruction
of
siegfried
they
communicated
their
plans
to
their
comrades
giselher
and
gernot
would
not
take
part
in
the
hunt
but
nevertheless
they
abstained
from
warning
siegfried
of
his
danger
for
this
however
they
paid
dearly
in
the
end
the
morning
dawned
bright
and
clear
and
away
the
warriors
cantered
with
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
a
boasting
of
bugles
farewell
to
kriemhild
before
departing
siegfried
had
said
farewell
to
kriemhild
who
she
knew
not
why
was
filled
with
dark
forebodings
grant
i
may
see
thee
safe
and
well
again
said
siegfried
thou
a
merry
heart
among
thy
kin
until
i
then
kriemhild
thought
on
the
secret
she
had
betrayed
to
hagen
but
she
could
not
tell
siegfried
of
it
sorely
she
wept
wishing
that
she
had
never
been
born
and
keen
and
deep
was
her
grief
she
said
not
to
the
hunt
a
baleful
dream
i
had
last
night
you
stood
upon
the
heath
and
two
wild
boars
approached
you
fled
but
they
pursued
you
and
wounded
you
and
the
blossoms
under
your
feet
were
red
with
blood
you
behold
my
tears
siegfried
i
dread
treachery
wot
you
not
of
some
who
cherish
for
us
a
deadly
hate
i
counsel
you
i
beg
you
dear
lord
go
not
to
the
siegfried
tried
to
laugh
her
fears
away
is
but
for
a
few
days
that
i
leave
thee
beloved
he
said
can
bear
me
hate
if
i
cherish
none
against
them
thy
brothers
wish
me
well
nor
have
i
offended
them
in
any
but
kriemhild
would
not
be
comforted
do
i
dread
this
parting
she
wailed
i
dreamed
another
dream
you
passed
by
two
mountains
and
they
rocked
on
their
bases
fell
and
buried
you
so
that
i
saw
you
no
more
go
not
for
bitterly
will
i
grieve
if
you
but
with
a
laugh
and
a
kiss
siegfried
was
gone
leaping
on
his
steed
he
rode
off
at
a
gallop
nevermore
was
she
to
see
him
in
life
into
the
gloomy
forest
the
abode
of
the
bear
the
wolf
and
the
wild
boar
plunged
the
knights
in
their
lust
of
royal
sport
brilliant
brave
and
goodly
of
cheer
was
the
company
and
rich
was
their
entertainment
many
laden
with
meats
and
wines
accompanied
them
and
the
panniers
on
the
backs
of
these
bulged
with
flesh
fish
and
game
fitting
for
the
table
of
a
great
king
on
a
broad
meadow
fringing
the
greenwood
they
camped
near
to
the
place
where
they
were
to
begin
the
hunt
and
watchers
were
sent
round
the
camp
so
that
no
one
with
a
message
of
warning
on
his
lips
might
win
to
the
ears
of
siegfried
siegfried
waxed
restless
for
he
had
come
not
to
feast
but
to
hunt
and
he
desired
to
be
home
again
with
kriemhild
comrades
he
cried
will
into
the
forest
with
me
and
rouse
the
game
said
the
crafty
hagen
us
find
who
is
the
best
sportsman
let
us
divide
the
huntsmen
and
the
hounds
so
that
each
may
ride
alone
where
he
chooses
and
great
praise
shall
be
to
him
who
hunts
the
best
and
bears
off
the
to
this
siegfried
agreed
and
asked
only
for
one
hound
that
had
been
well
broken
to
the
chase
to
accompany
him
this
was
granted
then
there
came
an
old
huntsman
with
a
limehound
and
led
the
sportsmen
to
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
game
many
beasts
were
started
and
hunted
to
the
death
as
is
ever
the
way
with
good
huntsmen
nothing
that
the
limehound
started
could
escape
siegfried
swift
was
his
steed
as
the
tempest
and
whether
it
was
bear
or
boar
he
soon
came
up
with
it
and
slew
it
once
he
encountered
a
stark
and
mighty
lion
aiming
an
arrow
at
the
monster
he
shot
it
through
the
heart
the
forest
rang
with
acclaim
at
the
deed
then
there
fell
by
his
hand
a
buffalo
an
elk
four
grim
aurochs
and
a
bear
nor
could
deer
or
hind
escape
him
so
swift
and
wight
was
he
anon
he
brought
a
wild
boar
to
bay
the
grisly
beast
charged
him
but
drawing
his
sword
siegfried
transfixed
it
with
the
shining
blade
pray
thee
lord
said
the
huntsman
to
us
something
living
for
in
truth
thy
strong
arm
doth
empty
both
mountain
and
merrily
rang
the
noise
of
the
chase
in
the
greenwood
that
day
the
hills
and
the
leafy
aisles
of
the
forest
resounded
with
the
shouts
of
the
hunters
and
the
baying
of
dogs
in
that
hunting
many
a
beast
met
its
and
great
was
the
rivalry
but
when
the
hunting
was
over
and
the
heroes
met
at
the
they
saw
that
siegfried
had
proved
himself
the
greatest
huntsmen
of
them
all
one
by
one
they
returned
from
the
forest
to
the
carrying
with
them
the
shaggy
fell
of
the
bear
the
bristly
and
the
grey
pelt
of
the
wolf
meat
abounded
in
that
place
and
the
blast
of
a
horn
announced
to
the
hungry
knights
that
the
king
was
about
to
feast
said
huntsman
to
him
hear
the
blast
of
a
horn
bidding
us
return
to
the
and
raising
his
bugle
to
his
lips
he
answered
it
siegfried
was
about
to
leave
the
forest
ambling
quietly
on
horseback
through
the
green
ways
when
he
roused
a
mighty
bear
the
limehound
was
slipped
and
the
bear
lumbered
off
pursued
by
siegfried
and
his
men
they
dashed
into
a
ravine
and
here
siegfried
thought
to
run
the
beast
down
but
the
sides
were
too
steep
and
the
knight
could
not
approach
it
on
horseback
lightly
he
sprang
from
his
steed
and
the
bear
seeing
his
approach
once
more
took
flight
so
swift
however
was
pursuit
that
ere
the
heavy
beast
could
elude
him
he
had
caught
it
by
its
shaggy
coat
and
had
bound
it
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
harmless
then
tying
it
across
his
back
he
brought
it
to
the
for
pastime
proudly
emerged
siegfried
from
the
forest
and
men
seeing
him
coming
ran
to
hold
his
horse
when
he
had
dismounted
he
dragged
the
bear
from
his
back
and
set
it
loose
immediately
the
dogs
pursued
it
and
in
its
efforts
to
escape
into
the
forest
it
dashed
madly
through
a
band
of
scullions
who
were
cooking
by
the
great
fire
there
was
a
clatter
of
iron
pots
and
burning
brands
were
strewed
about
many
goodly
dishes
were
spoiled
the
king
gave
order
to
slip
the
hounds
that
were
on
leash
taking
their
bows
and
spears
the
warriors
set
off
in
chase
of
the
they
feared
to
shoot
at
it
through
fear
of
wounding
any
among
the
great
pack
of
dogs
that
hung
upon
its
flanks
the
one
man
who
could
keep
pace
with
the
bear
was
siegfried
who
coming
up
with
it
pierced
it
with
his
sword
and
laid
it
dead
on
the
ground
then
lifting
the
carcass
on
his
shoulders
he
carried
it
back
to
the
fire
to
the
marvel
of
all
present
then
began
the
feasting
rich
meats
were
handed
around
and
all
was
festive
and
gay
no
suspicion
had
siegfried
that
he
was
doomed
for
his
heart
was
pure
of
all
deceit
but
the
wine
had
not
yet
been
brought
from
the
kitchen
whereat
sir
siegfried
wondered
addressing
gunther
he
said
do
not
your
men
bring
us
wine
if
this
is
the
manner
in
which
you
treat
good
hunters
certes
i
will
hunt
no
more
surely
i
have
deserved
better
at
your
and
the
false
gunther
answered
me
not
siegfried
for
the
fault
is
truly
he
would
have
us
perish
of
master
said
hagen
of
trony
fault
is
fault
it
methought
we
were
to
hunt
at
spessart
and
thither
did
i
send
the
wine
if
we
go
thirsty
credit
me
i
will
have
better
care
another
but
siegfried
was
athirst
and
said
wine
lacks
then
must
we
have
water
we
should
have
camped
nearer
to
the
the
slaying
of
siegfried
and
hagen
perceiving
his
chance
replied
know
of
a
cool
spring
close
at
hand
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
lead
you
sore
athirst
was
siegfried
and
starting
up
from
his
seat
he
followed
hagen
but
the
crafty
schemer
desiring
to
draw
him
away
from
the
company
so
that
none
else
would
follow
them
said
to
him
as
they
were
setting
out
for
the
spring
say
siegfried
that
none
can
keep
pace
with
you
when
you
run
let
us
see
may
easily
be
proved
said
siegfried
us
run
to
the
brook
for
a
wager
and
see
who
wins
there
first
if
i
lose
i
will
lay
me
before
you
in
the
grass
nay
i
will
more
for
i
will
carry
with
me
spear
shield
and
hunting
then
did
he
gird
on
his
weapons
even
to
his
quiver
while
the
others
stripped
and
off
they
set
but
siegfried
easily
passed
them
and
arrived
at
the
where
was
the
well
but
he
would
not
drink
first
for
courtesy
even
although
he
was
sore
athirst
gunther
came
up
bent
down
to
the
water
and
drank
of
the
pure
cool
well
siegfried
then
bent
him
to
drink
also
but
the
false
hagen
carrying
his
bow
and
sword
out
of
reach
sprang
back
and
gripped
the
mighty
spear
then
looked
he
for
the
secret
mark
on
his
vesture
that
kriemhild
had
worked
as
siegfried
drank
from
the
stream
hagen
poised
the
great
spear
and
plunged
it
between
the
shoulders
deeply
did
the
blade
pierce
through
the
spot
where
lay
the
secret
mark
so
that
the
blood
spurted
out
on
the
garments
hagen
left
the
spear
deep
in
heart
and
flew
in
grim
haste
from
the
place
though
wounded
to
the
death
siegfried
rose
from
the
stream
like
a
maddened
lion
and
cast
about
him
for
a
weapon
but
nothing
came
to
his
hand
but
his
shield
this
he
picked
up
from
the
edge
and
ran
at
hagen
who
might
not
escape
him
for
sore
wounded
as
he
was
so
mightily
did
he
smite
that
the
shield
burst
and
the
jewels
which
adorned
it
flew
in
flinders
the
blow
rang
across
the
meadow
as
hagen
fell
beneath
the
stroke
it
was
last
blow
his
countenance
was
already
that
of
a
dead
man
he
could
not
stand
upright
down
he
crashed
among
the
flowers
fast
flowed
his
blood
in
his
agony
he
began
to
upbraid
those
who
had
contrived
his
death
and
caitiffs
he
cried
this
the
price
you
pay
me
for
my
fealty
to
you
ill
have
you
done
by
your
friends
for
sons
of
yours
as
yet
unborn
will
feel
the
weight
of
this
deed
you
have
vented
your
spite
on
my
body
but
for
this
dastard
crime
all
good
knights
shall
shun
now
all
surrounded
him
and
those
that
were
true
among
them
mourned
for
him
gunther
also
wept
but
the
dying
man
turning
to
him
said
he
weep
for
the
evil
from
whom
the
evil
cometh
better
for
him
that
it
had
remained
undone
for
mighty
is
his
then
said
false
hagen
rue
ye
surely
our
care
is
past
who
will
now
withstand
us
right
glad
am
i
that
siegfried
is
no
loud
was
dole
for
kriemhild
was
so
foul
a
murder
done
as
thou
hast
done
on
me
o
king
he
said
to
gunther
saved
thy
life
and
honour
but
if
thou
canst
show
truth
to
any
on
earth
show
it
to
my
dear
wife
i
beg
of
thee
for
never
had
woman
such
woe
for
one
she
painfully
he
writhed
as
they
watched
him
and
as
he
became
weaker
he
spake
prophetically
shall
ye
rue
this
deed
in
the
days
to
come
he
groaned
know
all
of
ye
that
in
slaying
me
ye
have
slain
wet
were
the
flowers
with
his
blood
he
struggled
grimly
with
death
but
too
deep
had
been
the
blow
and
at
last
he
spake
no
more
they
laid
his
body
on
a
shield
of
ruddy
gold
and
took
counsel
with
one
another
how
they
should
hide
that
the
deed
had
been
done
by
hagen
have
we
fallen
on
evil
days
said
many
let
us
all
hide
this
thing
and
hold
to
one
tale
that
is
that
as
siegfried
rode
alone
in
the
forest
he
was
slain
by
said
hagen
of
trony
will
myself
bear
him
back
to
burgundy
it
is
little
concern
of
mine
if
kriemhild
grief
great
was
the
grief
of
kriemhild
when
she
learned
of
the
murder
of
her
husband
whose
body
had
been
placed
at
her
very
door
by
the
remorseless
hagen
he
and
the
rest
of
the
burgundians
pretended
that
siegfried
had
been
slain
by
bandits
but
on
their
approach
the
wounds
of
siegfried
commenced
to
bleed
afresh
in
mute
witness
of
treachery
kriemhild
secretly
vowed
a
terrible
revenge
and
would
not
quit
the
land
where
her
beloved
spouse
was
buried
for
four
years
she
spake
never
a
word
to
gunther
or
hagen
but
sat
silent
and
sad
in
a
chamber
near
the
minster
where
siegfried
was
buried
gunther
sent
for
the
nibelungen
treasure
for
the
purpose
of
propitiating
her
but
she
distributed
it
so
freely
among
dependents
that
hagen
conceived
the
suspicion
that
her
intention
was
to
suborn
them
to
her
cause
and
foment
rebellion
within
the
burgundian
dominions
therefore
he
seized
it
and
sank
it
in
the
rhine
forcing
brethren
never
to
divulge
its
whereabouts
it
is
a
circumstance
of
some
importance
that
when
this
treasure
enters
the
land
of
the
burgundians
they
take
the
name
of
nibelungs
as
siegfried
was
called
lord
of
the
nibelungs
on
first
possessing
the
hoard
and
for
this
reason
that
part
of
the
poem
which
commences
with
the
burgundian
acquirement
of
the
treasure
was
formerly
known
as
the
nibelungen
not
the
confiscation
of
the
treasure
was
another
sharp
wound
to
kriemhild
who
appears
to
have
bitterly
cherished
every
hostile
act
committed
against
her
by
her
uncle
hagen
and
her
brothers
and
to
have
secretly
nursed
her
grievances
throughout
the
remainder
of
her
saddened
existence
kriemhild
marries
attila
thirteen
years
after
the
death
of
siegfried
helche
wife
of
attila
or
etzel
king
of
the
huns
having
died
that
monarch
was
desirous
of
marrying
again
and
dispatched
his
faithful
councillor
rüdiger
margrave
of
bechlarn
to
the
burgundian
court
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
kriemhild
her
brethren
only
too
anxious
to
be
rid
of
her
accusing
presence
gladly
consented
to
the
match
but
hagen
had
forebodings
that
if
she
gained
power
she
would
wreak
a
dreadful
vengeance
on
them
all
but
he
was
overruled
and
rüdiger
was
permitted
to
interview
kriemhild
at
first
she
would
not
hear
of
the
marriage
but
when
rüdiger
expressed
his
surprise
at
the
manner
in
which
she
was
treated
in
her
own
country
and
hinted
that
if
she
were
to
wed
with
etzel
she
would
be
guarded
against
such
insulting
conduct
she
consented
but
first
she
made
rüdiger
swear
to
avenge
her
wrongs
and
this
he
did
lightly
thinking
it
merely
a
whim
which
would
pass
away
after
marriage
she
accompanied
rüdiger
to
the
court
of
etzel
stopping
at
his
castle
of
bechlarn
where
dwelt
his
wife
gotelind
and
his
daughter
dietlinde
the
journey
to
vienna
is
described
in
detail
at
length
they
met
etzel
at
tulna
with
kings
and
princes
in
his
train
and
a
mighty
retinue
the
greatest
guest
present
being
dietrich
of
bern
king
of
the
goths
who
with
his
band
of
wolfings
was
sojourning
at
the
court
of
etzel
the
nuptials
took
place
at
vienna
amid
great
magnificence
but
through
all
kriemhild
sorrowed
only
for
siegfried
and
brooded
long
and
darkly
on
her
schemes
of
vengeance
seven
years
passed
during
which
kriemhild
won
the
love
of
all
court
she
bore
the
king
a
son
ortlieb
and
gained
the
confidence
and
respect
of
his
advisers
another
six
years
passed
and
kriemhild
believed
that
the
time
for
vengeance
had
now
arrived
to
this
end
she
induced
etzel
to
invite
her
brethren
and
hagen
to
his
court
at
vienna
at
first
the
burgundians
liked
the
hospitable
message
well
but
suspicion
of
it
was
sown
in
their
minds
by
hagen
who
guessed
that
treachery
lurked
beneath
its
honeyed
words
in
the
end
they
accepted
the
invitation
and
journeyed
to
the
land
of
the
huns
a
thousand
and
sixty
knights
and
nine
thousand
soldiers
on
the
way
they
encountered
many
ill
omens
the
journey
through
eastern
frankland
rode
men
toward
the
river
main
led
by
hagen
for
well
he
knew
the
way
all
men
wondered
when
they
saw
the
host
for
never
had
any
seen
such
lordly
knights
or
such
a
rich
and
noble
retinue
well
might
one
see
that
these
were
princes
on
the
twelfth
day
they
came
to
the
banks
of
the
danube
hagen
riding
in
the
van
he
dismounted
on
the
sandy
shore
and
tied
his
steed
to
a
tree
the
river
was
swollen
with
rains
and
no
boats
were
in
sight
now
the
nibelungs
could
not
perceive
how
they
were
to
win
over
the
stream
for
it
was
broad
and
strong
and
hagen
rebuked
the
king
saying
be
with
you
lord
see
ye
not
that
the
river
is
swollen
and
its
flood
is
mighty
many
a
bold
knight
shall
we
lose
here
greatly
do
thy
words
help
hagen
spake
the
king
were
it
for
thee
to
search
for
a
ford
instead
of
wasting
thy
but
hagen
sneered
back
am
not
yet
weary
of
life
o
king
and
i
wish
not
to
drown
in
these
broad
waves
better
that
men
should
die
by
my
sword
in
land
stay
thou
then
by
the
edge
whilst
i
seek
a
ferryman
along
the
to
and
fro
he
sought
a
ferryman
soon
he
heard
a
splash
of
water
and
hearkened
in
a
spring
not
far
off
some
women
were
bathing
hagen
spied
them
and
crept
stealthily
toward
them
but
they
saw
his
approach
and
went
swiftly
away
hagen
approaching
seized
their
clothes
now
these
women
were
or
mermaids
and
one
of
them
hadburg
spake
to
him
hagen
she
said
wot
i
that
ye
wish
to
find
a
ferry
now
give
to
us
our
garments
and
we
will
show
you
where
one
they
breasted
the
waves
like
swans
once
more
spake
hadburg
will
ye
go
to
land
and
great
honours
will
ye
gain
there
aye
greater
than
hero
ever
rode
to
right
joyous
was
hagen
at
this
speech
back
he
handed
to
the
maidens
their
weeds
then
spake
another
mermaid
sieglind
warning
from
me
hagen
believe
not
the
word
of
mine
aunt

yonder
inn
by
the
side
there
is
the
only
ferry
over
the
at
once
hagen
made
off
but
sieglind
called
after
him
sir
knight
credit
me
you
are
too
much
in
haste
for
the
lord
of
these
lands
who
is
called
else
and
his
brother
knight
gelfrat
will
make
it
go
hard
with
you
an
ye
cross
their
dominions
guard
you
carefully
and
deal
wisely
with
the
ferryman
for
he
is
liegeman
unto
gelfrat
and
if
he
will
not
cross
the
river
to
you
call
for
him
and
say
thou
art
named
amelrich
a
hero
of
this
land
who
left
it
some
time
no
more
spake
hagen
to
the
but
searching
up
the
river
banks
he
found
an
inn
upon
the
farther
shore
loudly
he
called
across
the
flood
for
me
ferryman
he
said
i
will
bestow
upon
thee
an
armlet
of
ruddy
now
the
ferryman
was
a
noble
and
did
not
care
for
service
and
those
who
helped
him
were
as
proud
as
he
they
heard
hagen
calling
but
recked
not
of
it
loudly
did
he
call
across
the
water
which
resounded
to
his
cries
then
his
patience
exhausted
he
shouted
hither
for
i
am
amelrich
liegeman
to
else
who
left
these
lands
because
of
a
great
as
he
spake
he
raised
his
spear
on
which
was
an
armlet
of
bright
gold
cunningly
fashioned
the
haughty
ferryman
took
an
oar
and
rowed
across
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
farther
bank
he
spied
not
him
who
had
cried
for
passage
at
last
he
saw
hagen
and
in
great
anger
said
may
be
called
amelrich
but
you
are
not
like
him
whom
i
thought
to
be
here
for
he
was
my
brother
you
have
lied
to
me
and
there
you
may
hagen
attempted
to
impress
the
ferryman
by
kindness
but
he
refused
to
listen
to
his
words
telling
the
warrior
that
his
lords
had
enemies
wherefore
he
never
conveyed
strangers
across
the
river
hagen
then
offered
him
gold
and
so
angry
did
the
ferryman
become
that
he
struck
at
the
nibelung
with
his
rudder
oar
which
broke
over
head
but
the
warrior
smote
him
so
fiercely
with
his
sword
that
he
struck
his
head
off
and
cast
it
on
the
ground
the
skiff
began
to
drift
down
the
stream
and
hagen
wading
into
the
water
had
much
ado
to
secure
it
and
bring
it
back
with
might
and
main
he
pulled
and
in
turning
it
the
oar
snapped
in
his
hand
he
then
floated
down
stream
where
he
found
his
lords
standing
by
the
shore
they
came
down
to
meet
him
with
many
questionings
but
gunther
espying
the
blood
in
the
skiff
knew
well
what
fate
the
ferryman
had
met
with
hagen
then
called
to
the
footmen
to
lead
the
horses
into
the
river
that
they
might
swim
across
all
the
trappings
and
baggage
were
placed
in
the
skiff
and
hagen
playing
the
steersman
ferried
full
many
mighty
warriors
into
the
unknown
land
first
went
the
knights
then
the
then
followed
nine
thousand
footmen
by
no
means
was
hagen
idle
on
that
day
on
a
sudden
he
espied
the
chaplain
close
by
the
chapel
baggage
leaning
with
his
hands
upon
the
relics
and
recalling
that
the
wise
women
had
told
him
that
only
this
priest
would
return
and
none
other
of
the
nibelungs
he
seized
him
by
the
middle
and
cast
him
from
the
skiff
into
the
danube
sir
hagen
hold
cried
his
comrades
giselher
grew
wroth
but
hagen
only
smiled
then
said
sir
gernot
of
burgundy
what
availeth
you
the
death
wherefore
have
ye
slain
the
priest
but
the
clerk
struck
out
boldly
for
he
wished
to
save
his
life
but
this
hagen
would
not
have
and
thrust
him
to
the
bottom
once
more
he
came
to
the
surface
and
this
time
he
was
carried
by
the
force
of
the
waves
to
the
sandy
shore
then
hagen
knew
well
that
naught
might
avail
against
the
tidings
which
the
mermaids
had
told
him
that
not
a
nibelung
should
return
to
burgundy
when
the
skiff
had
been
unloaded
of
baggage
and
all
the
company
had
been
ferried
across
hagen
broke
it
in
pieces
and
cast
it
into
the
flood
when
asked
wherefore
he
had
done
so
and
how
they
were
to
return
from
the
land
of
the
huns
back
to
the
rhine
hagen
said
we
have
a
coward
on
this
journey
who
would
turn
his
back
on
the
huns
when
he
cometh
to
this
stream
he
will
die
a
shameful
in
passing
through
bavaria
the
burgundians
came
into
collision
with
gelfrat
and
his
brother
else
and
gelfrat
was
slain
they
were
received
at
bechlarn
by
rüdiger
who
treated
them
most
hospitably
and
showered
many
gifts
upon
them
bestowing
upon
gernot
his
favourite
sword
on
gunther
a
noble
suit
of
armour
and
on
hagen
a
famous
shield
he
accompanied
the
strangers
to
the
court
of
etzel
where
they
were
met
first
of
all
by
dietrich
of
bern
who
warned
them
that
kriemhild
prayed
daily
for
vengeance
upon
them
for
the
murder
of
siegfried
when
kriemhild
beheld
hagen
her
archenemy
she
wept
hagen
saw
and
his
helmet
have
not
made
a
good
journey
to
this
feast
he
muttered
welcome
are
welcome
nobles
and
knights
said
kriemhild
greet
you
not
for
your
kinship
what
bring
ye
me
from
worms
beyond
the
rhine
that
ye
should
be
so
welcome
to
me
here
where
have
ye
put
the
nibelung
treasure
it
is
mine
as
ye
know
full
well
and
ye
should
have
brought
it
me
to
hagen
replied
that
he
had
been
ordered
by
his
liege
lords
to
sink
it
in
the
rhine
and
there
must
it
lie
till
doomsday
at
this
kriemhild
grew
wroth
hagen
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
enough
to
do
to
carry
his
shield
and
breastplate
the
queen
alarmed
desired
that
all
weapons
should
be
placed
in
her
charge
but
to
this
hagen
demurred
and
said
that
it
was
too
much
honour
for
such
a
bounteous
princess
to
bear
his
shield
and
other
arms
to
his
lodging
kriemhild
lamented
saying
that
they
appeared
to
think
that
she
planned
treachery
against
them
but
to
this
dietrich
answered
in
great
anger
that
he
had
forewarned
gunther
and
his
brothers
of
her
treacherous
intentions
kriemhild
was
greatly
abashed
at
this
and
without
speaking
a
word
she
left
the
company
but
ere
she
went
she
darted
furious
glances
upon
them
from
which
they
well
saw
with
what
a
dangerous
foe
they
had
to
deal
king
etzel
then
asked
who
hagen
might
be
and
was
told
his
name
and
lineage
and
that
he
was
a
fierce
and
grim
warrior
etzel
then
recognized
him
as
a
warrior
who
had
been
a
hostage
with
him
along
with
walthar
of
spain
and
who
had
done
him
yeoman
service
events
march
this
last
passage
connects
the
nibelungenlied
with
the
latin
poem
of
walthar
of
aquitaine
indeed
the
great
german
epic
contains
repeated
allusions
to
this
work
of
the
ninth
or
tenth
century
which
is
dealt
with
later
in
this
book
events
now
march
quickly
kriemhild
offered
gold
untold
to
him
who
would
slay
hagen
but
although
her
enemy
was
within
her
grasp
so
doughty
was
the
warrior
and
so
terrible
his
appearance
that
none
dared
do
battle
with
him
a
hun
was
killed
by
accident
in
a
tournament
but
etzel
protected
his
burgundian
guests
at
length
blodelin
was
bribed
by
kriemhild
to
attack
dankwart
with
a
thousand
followers
men
were
all
slain
but
he
himself
made
good
his
escape
by
fighting
his
way
through
the
closely
packed
hunnish
ranks
dankwart
rushed
to
the
hall
where
the
burgundians
were
feasting
with
the
huns
and
in
great
wrath
acquainted
hagen
with
the
treacherous
attempt
which
had
been
made
upon
his
life
ye
brother
hagen
he
cried
as
ye
sit
there
our
knights
and
squires
lie
slain
in
their
hath

this
deed
asked
hagen
blodelin
with
his
carles
but
he
breathes
no
longer
for
myself
i
parted
his
head
from
his
he
died
as
a
warrior
then
it
is
well
for
him
replied
the
grim
hagen
brother
dankwart
ye

with
but
my
weeds
which
ye

said
dankwart
carelessly

many
in

that
i
could
not
give

tale
of

hagen
fiercely
it
yet
so
that
not
a

will
hold

with
these
brave
warriors
who
have
so
foully
slain

the
doorway
laughed
dankwart
shall
play
ye
the
part
of
chamberlain
brother
in
this
great
the
beginning
of
the
slaughter
hagen
mortally
incensed
at
the
slaughter
of
the
burgundians
by
the
huns
and
wrongly
suspecting
etzel
of
conspiracy
in
the
affair
drew
his
sword
and
with
one
blow
of
the
weapon
smote
off
the
head
of
young
ortlieb
the
son
of
etzel
and
kriemhild
then
began
a
slaughter
grim
and
great
the
huns
fought
at
first
in
but
as
they
saw
their
friends
fall
they
laid
on
in
good
earnest
and
the
combat
became
general
at
length
dietrich
of
bern
as
a
neutral
intervened
and
succeeded
in
bringing
about
a
whereby
etzel
kriemhild
and
rüdiger
were
permitted
to
leave
the
hall
the
remainder
of
attendants
being
slaughtered
like
sheep
in
great
wrath
etzel
and
kriemhild
offered
heavy
bribes
to
any
who
would
slay
hagen
several
attempts
were
made
but
without
avail
and
the
terrible
conflict
continued
till
nightfall
when
a
truce
was
called
from
his
place
of
vantage
in
the
hall
giselher
reproached
his
sister
with
her
treachery
and
kriemhild
offered
to
spare
her
brothers
if
they
would
consent
to
give
up
hagen
but
this
offer
they
contemptuously
refused
holding
death
preferable
to
such
dishonour
kriemhild
in
her
bitter
hate
set
the
hall
on
fire
and
most
of
the
burgundians
perished
in
the
conflagration
kriemhild
and
the
huns
were
astounded
however
when
in
the
morning
they
discovered
six
hundred
of
the
burgundians
were
still
alive
the
queen
appealed
to
rüdiger
to
complete
the
slaughter
but
he
aghast
at
the
idea
of
attacking
friends
whom
he
had
sworn
to
protect
was
about
to
refuse
when
kriemhild
reminded
him
of
his
oath
to
her
with
sorrow
he
proceeded
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
giselher
seeing
his
approach
imagined
he
came
as
an
ally
but
rüdiger
promptly
disillusioned
him
the
burgundians
were
as
loath
to
attack
rüdiger
as
he
them
and
hagen
and
he
exchanged
shields
the
combat
recommenced
and
great
was
the
slaughter
of
the
burgundians
until
gernot
and
rüdiger
came
together
and
slew
one
another
at
this
wolfhart
dietrich
of
lieutenant
led
his
men
against
the
burgundians
to
avenge
death
and
giselher
and
wolfhart
slew
one
another
volker
and
dankwart
were
also
slain
at
length
all
were
dead
save
gunther
and
hagen
whom
dietrich
accosted
and
whom
he
offered
to
save
but
this
offer
hagen
refused
then
the
lord
of
bern
grew
wroth
dietrich
intervenes
dietrich
then
donned
his
armour
and
was
assisted
to
accoutre
himself
by
hildebrand
he
felt
a
heroic
mood
inspire
him
a
good
sword
was
in
his
hand
and
a
stout
shield
was
on
his
arm
and
with
the
faithful
hildebrand
he
went
boldly
thence
hagen
espied
him
coming
and
said
i
see
sir
dietrich
he
desires
to
join
battle
with
us
after
his
great
sorrow
shall
we
see
to
whom
must
go
the
palm
i
fear
him
not
let
him
come
this
speech
was
not
unheard
of
dietrich
and
hildebrand
for
hagen
came
to
where
he
found
the
hero
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
house
dietrich
set
his
shield
on
the
ground
and
in
woeful
tones
said
king
wherefore
have
ye
treated
me
so
all
my
men
are
gone
i
am
bereft
of
all
good
knight
rüdiger
the
brave
and
true
is
slain
why
have
ye
done
these
things
never
should
i
have
worked
you
such
sorrow
think
on
yourselves
and
on
your
wrongs
do
ye
not
grieve
for
the
death
of
your
good
kinsmen
ah
how
i
mourn
the
fall
of
rüdiger
whatsoever
joy
i
have
known
in
life
that
have
ye
slain
it
is
not
for
me
to
sorrow
if
my
kin
be
so
dietrich
asked
hagen
not
your
men
come
to
this
hall
armed
from
head
to
heel
with
intent
to
slay
us
then
spake
dietrich
of
bern
is
work
and
not
the
doing
of
man
said
the
hero
thou
hast
fought
well
yield
thee
now
as
hostage
no
shame
shall
it
be
to
thee
thou
shalt
find
me
true
and
faithful
with
god
forbid
cried
hagen
am
still
unfettered
and
we
are
only
two
would
ye
have
me
yield
me
after
such
a
strife
would
i
save
thy
life
brave
and
noble
hagen
said
dietrich
earnestly
thee
i
beg
and
i
will
convoy
thee
safe
home
to
cease
to
crave
this
thing
replied
hagen
angrily
a
tale
shall
never
be
told
of
me
i
see
but
two
of
ye
ye
and
hildebrand
addressing
hagen
then
said
that
the
hour
would
come
when
he
would
gladly
accept
the
truce
his
lord
offered
but
hagen
in
reply
twitted
hildebrand
with
the
manner
in
which
he
had
fled
from
the
hall
dietrich
interrupted
them
saying
that
it
ill
beseemed
heroes
to
scold
like
ancient
beldams
and
forbade
hildebrand
to
say
more
then
seeing
that
hagen
was
grim
of
mood
dietrich
snatched
up
his
shield
a
moment
later
sword
rang
on
his
helm
but
the
lord
of
bern
guarded
him
well
against
the
dreadful
blows
warily
did
he
guard
him
against
mighty
falchion
balmung
at
last
he
dealt
hagen
a
wound
deep
and
wide
but
he
did
not
wish
to
slay
him
desiring
rather
to
have
such
a
hero
as
hostage
casting
away
his
shield
in
his
arms
he
gripped
hagen
of
trony
who
faint
from
loss
of
blood
was
overthrown
at
that
gunther
began
to
wail
greatly
dietrich
then
bound
hagen
and
led
him
to
where
stood
kriemhild
and
gave
him
into
her
hand
right
merry
was
she
at
the
sight
and
blessed
dietrich
bowing
low
before
him
telling
him
that
he
had
requited
her
of
all
her
woes
and
that
she
would
serve
him
until
death
but
dietrich
begged
life
of
the
queen
telling
her
that
he
would
requite
her
of
all
that
he
had
done
against
her
him
not
suffer
said
he
you
see
him
stand
there
but
she
ordered
that
hagen
be
led
away
to
durance
dietrich
then
went
to
where
gunther
stood
in
the
hall
and
engaged
him
in
strife
loudly
rang
the
swords
as
the
two
heroes
circled
in
fight
dealing
mighty
blows
on
each
helm
and
men
there
had
great
wonder
how
sir
dietrich
did
not
fall
so
sorely
angry
was
gunther
for
the
loss
of
hagen
but
the
blood
was
seen
to
ooze
through
his
armourings
and
as
he
grew
fainter
dietrich
overcame
him
as
he
had
done
hagen
and
bound
him
then
was
he
too
taken
before
kriemhild
and
once
again
the
noble
dietrich
begged
a
life
from
the
queen
this
she
gladly
promised
but
treachery
was
in
her
heart
then
went
she
to
hagen
and
said
to
him
that
if
he
would
return
the
treasure
to
her
he
might
still
go
home
safe
and
sound
to
burgundy
the
grim
champion
answered
that
she
wasted
her
words
and
that
he
had
sworn
an
oath
not
to
show
the
hoard
while
any
of
his
lords
still
lived
at
that
answer
a
terrible
thought
entered
the
mind
of
kriemhild
and
without
the
least
compunction
she
ordered
that
her
brother
life
be
taken
they
struck
off
his
head
like
that
of
a
common
malefactor
and
by
the
hair
she
carried
it
to
the
knight
of
trony
full
sorrowfully
he
gazed
upon
it
then
turning
his
eyes
away
from
the
haggard
and
distorted
features
he
said
to
kriemhild
is
the
noble
king
of
burgundy
and
giselher
and
gernot
also
now
none
knoweth
of
the
treasure
save
me
and
it
shall
ever
be
hid
from
thee
thou
the
death
of
hagen
and
kriemhild
greatly
wroth
was
kriemhild
when
she
heard
that
her
stratagem
had
come
to
naught
ill
have
ye
requited
me
sir
hagen
she
cried
fiercely
and
drawing
the
sword
of
siegfried
from
its
sheath
she
raised
it
with
both
hands
and
struck
off
the
head
amazed
and
sorrowful
was
king
etzel
when
he
saw
this
cried
he
such
a
hero
should
die
bound
and
by
the
hands
of
a
woman
here
lieth
the
best
of
knights
that
ever
came
to
battle
or
bore
a
shield
sorely
doth
this
deed
grieve
me
however
much
i
was
his
then
spake
old
hildebrand
full
of
horror
that
such
a
thing
had
come
to
pass
shall
it
profit
her
that
she
hath
slain
him
so
foully
he
cried
hap
to
me
yet
will
i
avenge
bold
with
these
words
he
rushed
at
kriemhild
loudly
did
she
cry
out
but
little
did
that
avail
her
for
with
one
great
stroke
hildebrand
clove
her
in
twain
the
victims
of
fate
lay
still
sorely
wept
dietrich
and
etzel
so
ended
the
high
feast
in
death
and
woe
more
is
not
to
be
said
let
the
dead
rest
thus
fell
the
nibelungs
thus
was
accomplished
the
fate
of
their
house
the
place
of
origin
of
the
nibelungenlied
is
much
disputed
a
number
of
scholars
arguing
for
its
scandinavian
genesis
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
consensus
of
opinion
among
modern
students
of
the
epic
is
that
it
took
its
rise
in
germany
along
the
banks
of
the
rhine
among
the
frankish
division
of
the
teutonic
folk
lend
colour
to
this
assumption
thus
in
the
odenwald
we
have
a
siegfried
spring
a
brunhild
bed
is
situated
near
frankfort
there
is
a
hagen
well
at
lorch
and
the
drachenfels
or
rock
is
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
singularly
enough
however
if
we
desire
a
full
survey
of
the
nibelungenlied
story
we
have
to
supplement
it
from
earlier
versions
in
use
among
the
peoples
of
scandinavia
and
iceland
these
are
distinctly
of
a
more
simple
and
early
form
than
the
german
versions
and
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
they
represent
the
original
nibelungenlied
story
which
was
preserved
faithfully
in
the
north
whereas
the
familiarity
of
its
theme
among
the
southern
teutons
caused
it
to
be
altered
again
and
again
for
the
sake
of
variety
until
to
some
extent
it
lost
its
original
outline
moreover
such
poems
as
the
norse
volsunga
saga
and
thidreks
saga
not
to
speak
of
other
and
lesser
epics
afford
many
details
relating
to
the
nibelungenlied
which
it
does
not
contain
in
its
present
form
it
may
be
interesting
to
give
a
summary
of
the
volsunga
saga
which
is
a
prose
paraphrase
of
the
edda
songs
the
volsunga
saga
the
epic
deals
with
the
history
of
the
treasure
of
the
nibelungs
and
tells
how
a
certain
hreithmar
had
it
given
him
by
the
god
loki
as
a
weregild
for
the
slaying
of
the
son
otur
or
otter
who
occasionally
took
the
shape
of
that
animal
loki
in
his
turn
obtained
the
ransom
from
the
dwarf
andwari
who
had
stolen
it
from
the
of
the
rhine
the
dwarf
incensed
at
losing
the
treasure
pronounced
a
most
dreadful
curse
upon
it
and
its
possessors
saying
that
it
would
be
the
death
of
those
who
should
get
hold
of
it
thus
hreithmar
its
first
owner
was
slain
in
his
sleep
by
his
son
fafnir
who
carried
the
treasure
away
to
the
gnita
heath
where
having
taken
the
form
of
a
dragon
he
guarded
it
the
the
passed
into
the
keeping
of
sigurd
the
norse
form
of
siegfried
a
descendant
of
the
race
of
the
volsungs
a
house
tracing
its
genealogy
back
to
the
god
woden
the
full
story
of
ancestry
it
is
unnecessary
to
deal
with
here
as
it
has
little
influence
on
the
connexion
of
the
story
of
the
volsungs
with
the
nibelungenlied
sigurd
came
under
the
tutelage
of
regin
the
son
of
hreithmar
and
brother
of
fafnir
received
the
magic
steed
grani
from
the
king
and
then
was
requested
by
regin
to
assist
him
in
obtaining
the
treasure
guarded
by
fafnir
after
forging
a
sword
for
himself
out
of
the
fragments
of
a
blade
left
by
his
father
siegmund
he
avenged
his
death
and
then
set
out
to
attack
fafnir
meeting
woden
he
was
advised
by
the
god
to
dig
a
ditch
in
the
path
encountering
fafnir
he
slew
him
and
the
blood
ran
into
the
ditch
without
which
he
would
have
been
drowned
by
the
flood
of
gore
from
the
monster
as
the
dragon
died
he
warned
sigurd
against
the
treasure
and
its
curse
and
against
regin
who
he
said
was
planning
death
when
regin
saw
that
the
dragon
was
quite
dead
he
crept
from
his
and
quaffed
its
blood
then
cutting
out
the
heart
he
begged
sigurd
to
roast
it
for
him
in
this
operation
sigurd
burnt
his
fingers
and
instinctively
thrust
them
in
his
mouth
thus
tasting
of
the
blood
whereupon
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
comprehended
the
language
of
the
birds
hearkening
intently
to
the
strange
new
sounds
he
learned
that
if
he
himself
should
eat
the
heart
then
he
would
be
wiser
than
anyone
in
the
world
the
birds
further
betrayed
evil
intentions
and
advised
sigurd
to
kill
him
seeing
his
danger
sigurd
went
to
where
regin
was
and
cut
off
his
head
and
ate
heart
following
once
again
the
advice
of
the
birds
he
brought
the
treasure
from
the
cave
and
then
journeyed
to
the
mountain
hindarfjall
where
he
rescued
the
sleeping
valkyr
brynhild
or
brunhild
who
had
been
pierced
by
the
of
woden
and
lay
in
slumber
clad
in
full
armour
within
a
castle
surrounded
by
a
hedge
of
flame
mounting
his
horse
grani
sigurd
rode
through
the
fiery
obstacle
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
he
entered
it
and
finding
the
maiden
asleep
cut
the
armour
from
her
with
his
during
her
long
slumber
it
had
become
very
tight
upon
her
brunhild
hailed
him
with
joy
for
she
had
vowed
never
to
marry
a
man
who
knew
fear
she
taught
sigurd
much
wisdom
and
finally
they
pledged
their
troth
he
then
departed
after
promising
to
remain
faithful
to
her
on
his
travels
he
arrived
at
the
court
of
giuki
or
gibicho
a
king
whose
domains
were
situated
on
the
lower
rhine
three
sons
had
he
gunnar
hogni
and
gutthorm
and
a
daughter
gudrun
a
maiden
of
exquisite
beauty
his
queen
bore
the
name
of
grimhild
and
was
deeply
versed
in
magical
science
but
was
evil
of
nature
they
received
sigurd
with
much
honour
grimhild
knew
of
his
relations
with
brunhild
and
gave
him
a
potion
which
produced
forgetfulness
of
the
so
that
he
accepted
the
hand
of
gudrun
which
giuki
offered
him
the
marriage
was
celebrated
with
great
splendour
and
sigurd
remained
at
court
much
acclaimed
for
his
deeds
of
skill
and
valour
grimhild
meanwhile
urged
upon
her
son
gunnar
to
sue
for
the
hand
of
brunhild
he
resolved
to
accept
her
advice
and
set
out
to
visit
her
taking
with
him
sigurd
and
a
few
other
friends
he
first
visited
father
budli
and
afterward
her
heimir
from
whom
he
heard
that
brunhild
was
free
to
choose
the
man
she
desired
but
that
she
would
espouse
no
one
who
had
not
ridden
through
the
hedge
of
flame
they
proceeded
to
castle
gunnar
attempted
to
pierce
the
flames
but
was
unable
to
do
so
even
when
seated
on
horse
for
grani
would
not
stir
knowing
well
that
it
was
not
his
master
who
urged
him
on
at
last
they
made
use
of
a
potion
that
had
been
given
them
by
grimhild
and
sigurd
in
the
shape
of
gunnar
rode
through
the
wall
of
fire
he
explained
to
the
that
he
was
the
son
of
giuki
and
had
come
to
claim
her
hand
the
destiny
laid
upon
her
by
woden
compelled
her
to
consent
but
she
did
so
with
much
reluctance
sigurd
then
passed
three
nights
at
her
side
placing
his
sword
gram
between
them
as
a
bar
of
separation
but
at
parting
he
drew
from
her
finger
the
ring
with
which
he
had
originally
plighted
his
troth
to
her
and
replaced
it
with
another
taken
from
hoard
shortly
afterward
the
wedding
of
gunnar
and
brunhild
was
celebrated
with
lavish
splendour
and
they
all
returned
to
court
matters
progressed
happily
for
some
time
until
one
day
brunhild
and
gudrun
went
to
bathe
in
the
river
brunhild
refused
to
bathe
farther
down
the
stream
than
is
in
the
water
which
flowed
from
gudrun
to
that
her
husband
was
the
son
of
a
king
while
sigurd
had
become
a
menial
gudrun
retorted
to
her
that
not
gunnar
but
sigurd
had
penetrated
the
hedge
of
fire
and
had
taken
from
her
the
ring
which
she
then
showed
to
brunhild
in
proof
of
her
words
a
second
and
even
more
disturbing
conversation
followed
which
served
only
to
increase
the
hatred
between
the
women
and
brunhild
planned
a
dreadful
vengeance
she
feigned
illness
retired
to
her
bed
and
when
gunnar
inquired
what
ailed
her
asked
him
if
he
recalled
the
circumstances
of
their
wooing
and
how
sigurd
and
not
he
rode
through
the
flames
to
win
her
so
furious
was
she
at
the
dreadful
insult
which
had
been
placed
upon
her
by
gudrun
that
she
attempted
to
take
life
she
still
loved
sigurd
and
could
never
forgive
gunnar
and
his
sister
for
robbing
her
of
him
so
terrible
was
her
grief
that
she
sank
into
a
deep
slumber
in
which
she
remained
for
seven
days
no
one
daring
to
waken
her
finally
sigurd
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
she
lamented
to
him
how
cruelly
she
had
been
deceived
she
declared
that
he
and
she
had
been
destined
for
one
another
and
that
now
she
had
received
for
a
husband
a
man
who
could
not
match
with
him
sigurd
begged
her
not
to
harbour
a
grudge
against
gunnar
and
told
her
of
his
mighty
that
he
had
slain
the
king
of
the
danes
and
also
the
brother
of
budli
a
great
brunhild
did
not
cease
to
lament
and
planned
death
threatening
gunnar
with
the
loss
of
his
dominions
and
his
life
if
he
would
not
kill
sigurd
gunnar
hesitated
for
a
long
time
but
at
length
consented
and
calling
hogni
ordered
him
to
slay
sigurd
that
they
might
thus
obtain
the
treasure
of
the
rhinegold
hogni
was
aghast
at
this
and
reminded
him
that
they
had
pledged
their
oaths
to
sigurd
then
gunnar
remembered
that
his
brother
gutthorm
had
sworn
no
oath
of
loyalty
to
sigurd
and
so
might
perform
the
deed
they
plied
him
with
wolf
and
snake
meat
to
eat
so
that
he
might
become
savage
by
nature
and
they
tried
to
excite
his
greed
with
tales
of
the
rhinegold
treasure
twice
did
gutthorm
make
the
attempt
as
sigurd
lay
in
bed
but
twice
he
was
deterred
from
slaying
him
by
the
penetrating
glance
the
third
time
however
he
found
him
asleep
and
pierced
him
with
his
sword
sigurd
awoke
and
hurled
his
own
sword
after
gutthorm
cutting
him
in
two
he
then
died
stating
that
he
knew
brunhild
to
be
the
instigator
of
the
murder
grief
was
frantic
and
at
this
brunhild
laughed
aloud
as
if
with
joy
but
later
she
became
more
than
wife
herself
and
determined
to
be
done
with
life
donning
her
richest
array
she
pierced
herself
with
a
sword
as
she
expired
she
requested
to
be
burned
on
funeral
pyre
and
also
prophesied
that
gudrun
would
marry
atli
and
that
the
death
of
many
heroes
would
be
caused
thereby
adventure
gudrun
in
her
great
sorrow
fled
to
the
court
of
king
half
of
denmark
at
which
she
tarried
for
seven
years
her
mother
grimhild
learned
of
her
place
of
concealment
and
attempted
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
her
and
gunnar
she
was
offered
much
treasure
if
she
would
marry
atli
king
of
the
huns
and
finally
she
consented
atli
became
covetous
of
the
latter
had
taken
possession
of
the
invited
him
to
his
court
but
gudrun
sent
a
message
of
warning
to
her
brother
the
runes
which
composed
this
however
were
so
manipulated
by
vingi
one
of
the
messengers
that
they
read
as
a
harmless
invitation
instead
of
a
warning
and
this
gunnar
and
hogni
determined
to
accept
they
reached
court
in
due
season
and
as
they
arrived
vingi
disclosed
his
true
character
stating
that
he
had
lured
them
into
a
snare
hogni
slew
him
and
as
they
rode
to
dwelling
the
hunnish
king
and
his
sons
armed
themselves
for
battle
and
demanded
treasure
which
they
declared
belonged
by
right
to
gudrun
gunnar
refused
to
part
with
it
and
a
great
combat
began
gudrun
armed
herself
and
fought
on
the
side
of
her
brothers
a
fierce
battle
raged
with
great
loss
on
both
sides
until
nearly
all
the
nibelungs
were
slain
and
gunnar
and
hogni
forced
to
yield
to
the
power
of
numbers
were
captured
and
bound
gunnar
was
now
asked
if
he
would
purchase
his
life
with
the
treasure
and
he
replied
eventually
that
he
would
do
so
if
he
were
given
heart
to
humour
his
request
the
huns
cut
out
the
heart
of
a
slave
and
brought
it
to
him
but
gunnar
saw
through
the
stratagem
and
recognized
the
heart
as
that
of
a
coward
they
then
cut
out
heart
and
gunnar
seeing
that
this
was
indeed
the
heart
of
a
prince
was
glad
for
now
he
alone
knew
where
the
treasure
of
the
rhinegold
was
hid
and
he
vowed
that
atli
should
never
know
of
its
whereabouts
in
great
wrath
the
hunnish
monarch
ordered
gunnar
to
be
thrown
into
a
pit
of
snakes
his
hands
were
bound
yet
the
hero
from
the
rhine
played
so
exquisitely
with
his
toes
on
a
harp
which
gudrun
had
sent
to
him
that
he
lulled
to
sleep
all
the
the
exception
of
an
adder
which
stung
him
to
the
heart
so
that
he
died
atli
spurning
the
bodies
of
the
fallen
turned
to
gudrun
saying
that
she
alone
was
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
that
evening
she
killed
her
two
sons
erp
and
eitil
and
served
their
flesh
at
the
banquet
which
the
king
was
giving
for
his
warriors
when
atli
asked
for
the
boys
to
be
brought
to
him
he
was
told
that
he
had
drunk
their
blood
in
his
wine
and
had
eaten
their
hearts
that
night
while
he
slept
gudrun
took
son
hnifling
who
desired
to
avenge
his
slaughtered
father
and
entering
chamber
the
young
man
thrust
a
sword
through
the
breast
of
the
hunnish
king
he
awoke
through
the
pain
of
his
wound
and
was
informed
by
gudrun
that
she
was
his
murderess
he
bitterly
reproached
her
only
to
be
told
that
she
cared
for
no
one
but
sigurd
last
request
was
that
his
obsequies
should
be
such
as
were
fitting
for
a
king
and
to
ensure
that
he
had
proper
funeral
rites
gudrun
set
fire
to
his
castle
and
burnt
his
body
together
with
those
of
his
dead
retainers
the
further
adventures
of
gudrun
are
related
in
certain
songs
in
the
edda
but
the
volsunga
saga
proper
ends
with
the
death
of
atli
comparisons
between
the
epics
we
see
from
this
account
that
the
volsunga
saga
presents
in
many
respects
an
older
form
of
the
nibelungenlied
story
sigurd
is
the
same
as
siegfried
gunnar
hogni
and
gudrun
are
parallels
with
gunther
hagen
and
strangely
enough
that
name
is
also
borne
by
mother
in
the
volsunga
saga
we
will
recall
that
the
events
detailed
in
the
first
part
of
the
lay
of
the
volsungs
are
vaguely
alluded
to
in
the
nibelungenlied
which
assures
us
that
the
connexion
we
have
thus
drawn
is
a
correct
one
myth
or
history
we
come
now
to
the
vexed
question
as
to
whether
the
nibelungenlied
is
mythical
or
historical
in
origin
this
question
has
been
approached
by
certain
scholars
who
because
of
their
lack
of
mythological
knowledge
have
rendered
themselves
ridiculous
in
attempting
elucidations
on
a
purely
historical
basis
an
entirely
mythological
origin
is
not
here
pleaded
for
the
nibelungenlied
but
it
should
surely
be
recognized
even
by
the
historian
who
is
without
mythological
training
that
no
story
of
any
antiquity
exists
which
does
not
contain
a
substantial
substratum
of
mythical
circumstance
so
speedy
is
the
crystallization
of
myth
around
the
nucleus
of
historical
fact
and
so
tenacious
is
its
hold
that
to
disentangle
it
from
the
factors
of
reality
is
a
task
of
the
most
extreme
difficulty
requiring
careful
handling
by
scholars
who
possess
a
wide
and
accurate
knowledge
of
mythological
processes
even
when
students
of
history
have
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
the
intrusion
into
their
domain
of
the
mythologist
and
the
folklorist
so
much
remains
to
be
effected
in
the
disentanglement
of
what
is
believed
to
be
absolute
historical
fact
from
the
mythical
growths
which
surround
it
that
were
they
conscious
of
the
labour
which
yet
remains
in
this
respect
even
the
most
advanced
of
our
historians
would
stand
aghast
at
the
task
which
awaits
their
successors
in
the
nibelungenlied
we
have
a
case
in
point
what
the
exact
mythological
elements
contained
in
it
represent
it
would
indeed
be
difficult
to
say
students
of
the
müllerian
school
have
seen
in
siegfried
a
who
awakens
brunhild
a
nature
goddess
this
aspect
is
not
without
its
likelihood
for
in
one
passage
brunhild
tells
how
odin
thrust
into
her
side
a
the
sharp
sting
of
icy
how
the
spell
rendered
her
unconscious
until
awakened
by
siegfried
there
are
many
other
mythological
factors
in
the
story
and
either
a
diurnal
or
seasonal
myth
may
be
indicated
by
it
but
it
would
require
a
separate
volume
to
set
forth
the
arguments
in
favour
of
a
partial
mythological
origin
of
the
nibelungenlied
one
point
is
to
be
especially
point
which
we
have
not
so
far
seen
noted
in
a
controversy
where
it
would
have
seemed
that
every
special
circumstance
had
been
laboured
to
the
that
is
that
besides
mythological
matter
entering
into
the
original
scheme
of
the
nibelungenlied
a
very
considerable
mass
of
mythical
matter
has
crystallized
around
it
since
it
was
cast
into
its
first
form
this
will
be
obvious
to
any
folklorist
of
experience
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
compare
the
scandinavian
and
german
versions
the
historical
theory
abeling
and
boer
the
most
recent
protagonists
of
the
historical
theory
profess
to
see
in
the
nibelungenlied
the
misty
and
confused
traditions
of
real
events
and
people
abeling
admits
that
it
contains
mythical
elements
but
identifies
siegfried
with
segeric
son
of
the
burgundian
king
sigismund
brunhild
with
the
historical
brunichildis
and
hagan
with
a
certain
hagnerius
the
basis
of
the
story
according
to
him
is
thus
a
medley
of
burgundian
historical
traditions
round
which
certain
mythological
details
have
crystallized
the
historical
nucleus
is
the
overthrow
of
the
burgundian
kingdom
of
gundahar
by
the
huns
in
other
events
historical
in
themselves
were
torn
from
their
proper
epochs
and
grouped
around
this
nucleus
thus
the
murder
of
segeric
which
happened
years
later
and
the
murder
of
attila
by
his
burgundian
wife
ildico
are
torn
from
their
proper
historical
surroundings
and
fitted
into
the
story
boer
on
the
other
hand
will
not
have
it
that
there
is
any
mythology
at
all
in
the
nibelungenlied
and
according
to
him
the
nucleus
of
the
legend
is
an
old
story
of
the
murder
of
relatives
this
became
grafted
on
the
siegfried
legend
according
to
some
authorities
but
boer
will
not
admit
this
and
presents
a
number
of
arguments
to
disprove
the
mythical
character
of
the
siegfried
story
the
reasoning
is
ingenious
but
by
no
means
valuable
we
know
that
the
mythologies
of
the
ancient
germans
and
the
scandinavians
were
in
many
respects
though
not
in
all
one
and
the
same
system
and
we
find
many
of
the
characters
of
the
nibelungenlied
among
the
divine
beings
alluded
to
in
the
edda
it
is
unlikely
that
the
dramatis
personae
of
a
german
murder
story
would
find
its
way
into
even
the
most
decadent
form
of
scandinavian
belief
there
is
every
reason
to
conclude
that
a
great
many
historical
elements
are
to
be
discovered
in
the
nibelungenlied
but
to
discount
entirely
those
which
are
mythical
is
absurd
and
even
more
futile
than
it
would
be
to
deny
that
many
of
the
incidents
related
in
the
great
epic
reflect
in
some
measure
historical
events
the
klage
the
klage
a
sequel
to
the
nibelungenlied
recounts
somewhat
tamely
the
events
which
follow
upon
the
dire
catastrophe
pictured
in
the
great
german
epic
it
is
on
the
whole
more
modern
than
the
lied
and
most
critics
ascribe
it
to
a
period
so
late
as
the
fourteenth
century
it
is
highly
artificial
and
inartistic
and
grimm
points
out
that
it
is
obvious
that
in
penning
it
the
author
did
not
have
the
nibelungenlied
as
we
know
it
before
him
as
it
is
practically
unknown
to
readers
a
résumé
of
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
it
describes
the
search
among
the
dead
bodies
in
the
house
of
slaughter
the
burying
of
them
the
journey
of
swemmelin
to
the
rhine
by
way
of
bechlarn
and
passau
to
give
the
tidings
of
the
massacre
to
queen
brunhild
his
return
and
the
final
parting
from
etzel
of
dietrich
and
his
wife
herrat
who
also
take
bechlarn
on
their
way
level
and
poor
as
the
narrative
is
it
reaches
pathos
in
the
description
of
the
arrival
of
the
messengers
at
bechlarn
to
spare
his
niece
gotelint
dietrich
tells
them
not
to
mention
the
terrible
events
which
have
happened
but
to
say
that
he
and
rüdiger
will
soon
come
to
see
her
or
at
all
events
himself
they
are
received
with
great
and
her
daughter
think
to
receive
love
without
sorrow
as
often
before
from
beloved
the
young
margravine
has
a
foreboding
of
evil
at
seeing
the
messengers
so
seven
then
her
mother
tells
her
of
an
evil
dream
which
she
has
had
and
she
in
turn
has
to
tell
of
another
which
has
come
to
herself
meanwhile
the
messengers
are
at
hand
and
are
observed
to
be
sad
they
give
to
wife
the
false
tidings
of
peace
which
they
have
been
instructed
to
relate
and
the
younger
lady
wonders
that
her
father
should
have
sent
no
message
to
herself
specially
the
ladies
continue
to
question
the
messengers
about
kriemhild
how
has
she
received
her
brother
what
did
she
say
to
hagen
what
to
gunther
how
is
it
asks
the
younger
one
that
giselher
has
sent
her
never
a
message
each
lying
answer
costs
the
speaker
more
and
more
sorrow
and
at
last
his
tears
begin
to
flow
the
young
margravine
exclaims
that
there
must
be
ill
news
that
evil
has
befallen
them
and
that
the
guests
and
her
father
must
be
dead
as
she
speaks
one
of
the
messengers
can
contain
himself
no
longer
and
a
cry
breaks
with
blood
from
his
mouth
all
his
companions
burst
into
tears
at
the
same
time
the
margravine
conjures
them
by
their
troth
to
tell
how
they
parted
from
her
husband
saying
that
the
lie
must
have
an
end

the
messenger
we
wished
to
deny
to
you
that
which
we
yet
must
say
since
no

could
conceal

after
this
hour

are

the

joy
and
of
their
sorrow
i
now
say
to
you
no
more
this
lay
is
called
ein
walthar
of
aquitaine
one
of
the
grandest
and
most
heroic
epics
of
the
great
age
of
romance
is
that
of
walthar
of
aquitaine
it
is
indissolubly
connected
with
the
rhine
and
with
the
city
of
worms
because
in
the
vicinity
the
hero
whose
feats
of
arms
it
celebrates
fought
his
greatest
battle
it
was
written
in
monkish
latin
at
any
time
between
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
and
is
connected
with
later
versions
of
the
nibelungenlied
which
contains
numerous
allusions
to
it
founded
upon
traditional
materials
collected
and
edited
by
some
gifted
occupant
of
the
cloister
it
opens
in
the
grand
manner
by
telling
how
the
empire
of
the
huns
had
already
lasted
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
when
attila
invaded
the
territory
of
the
franks
ruled
over
by
gibicho
gibicho
trembling
for
his
throne
by
the
advice
of
his
counsellors
determined
to
pay
tribute
and
give
hostages
to
the
terrible
hun
but
as
his
son
gunther
was
too
young
to
be
sent
as
a
hostage
he
put
in
his
place
a
noble
youth
named
hagen
and
paying
the
invaders
a
great
indemnity
in
treasure
thus
secured
the
safety
of
his
kingdom
the
huns
then
turned
their
attention
to
the
burgundians
whose
king
herric
had
an
only
daughter
the
beautiful
hildegund
herric
shut
himself
up
in
the
town
of
châlons
and
calling
together
his
ministers
imparted
to
them
his
deliberations
the
franks
who
are
so
much
stronger
than
we
have
yielded
he
said
can
we
of
burgundy
hope
to
triumph
against
such
a
host
i
will
give
my
daughter
hildegund
as
a
hostage
to
the
huns
better
that
one
should
suffer
than
that
the
realm
should
be
laid
the
huns
accepted
hildegund
as
a
hostage
and
with
much
treasure
turned
their
faces
westward
to
the
kingdom
of
aquitaine
whose
king
alphere
had
an
only
son
walthar
who
was
already
affianced
to
hildegund
he
too
had
to
give
up
his
son
as
hostage
and
pay
tribute
although
ruthless
as
an
invader
and
cruel
as
a
conqueror
attila
displayed
the
utmost
kindness
to
the
children
he
treated
them
in
every
way
as
befitted
their
rank
and
handing
the
girl
over
to
the
queen
had
the
boys
trained
in
martial
exercises
and
intellectual
arts
till
in
a
few
time
they
easily
surpassed
all
of
the
huns
in
every
accomplishment
that
becomes
a
knight
so
greatly
did
queen
trust
the
maiden
hildegund
that
she
placed
in
her
charge
all
the
treasures
attila
had
won
in
war
life
was
pleasant
for
the
youthful
hostages
but
one
day
news
came
to
the
ear
of
attila
that
gibicho
was
dead
and
that
gunther
was
his
successor
learning
this
hagen
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
by
night
and
fearing
that
walthar
would
follow
his
example
queen
suggested
to
her
husband
that
he
should
marry
the
youthful
warrior
who
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
at
the
head
of
the
huns
to
a
hunnish
maiden
but
walthar
had
no
mind
for
such
a
match
and
declared
himself
unworthy
of
marriage
urging
that
if
wedded
he
might
neglect
his
military
duties
and
declaring
that
nothing
was
so
sweet
to
him
as
for
ever
to
be
busy
in
the
faithful
service
of
his
lord
attila
never
doubting
him
and
lulled
from
all
suspicion
by
further
victories
won
by
him
over
a
rebellious
people
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
but
on
returning
from
his
successful
campaign
walthar
had
speech
with
hildegund
on
the
subject
of
their
betrothal
hitherto
untouched
between
them
at
first
she
thought
that
he
merely
mocked
her
but
he
protested
that
he
was
weary
of
exile
was
anxious
to
escape
and
would
have
fled
ere
this
but
that
it
grieved
him
to
leave
her
alone
at
the
hunnish
court
her
reply
is
one
characteristic
of
women
in
medieval
days
my
lord
command
she
said
am
ready
for
his
love
to
bear
evil
hap
or
she
then
provided
him
out
of
the
of
attila
with
helm
hauberk
and
they
filled
two
chests
with
hunnish
money
in
the
shape
of
golden
rings
placed
four
pairs
of
sandals
on
the
top
and
several
and
walthar
told
hildegund
that
all
must
be
ready
in
a
time
the
escape
on
the
seventh
day
after
this
walthar
gave
a
great
feast
to
attila
his
nobles
and
his
household
he
pressed
food
and
wine
on
the
huns
and
when
their
platters
were
clear
and
the
tables
removed
he
handed
to
the
king
a
splendid
carven
goblet
full
to
the
brim
of
the
richest
and
oldest
wine
this
attila
emptied
at
a
draught
and
ordered
all
his
men
to
follow
his
example
soon
the
wine
overcame
the
huns
who
pressed
by
walthar
caroused
so
deeply
that
all
were
at
last
rendered
unconscious
walthar
gave
the
sign
to
hildegund
and
they
slipped
from
the
hall
and
from
the
stable
took
his
noble
lion
so
named
for
his
courage
they
hung
the
like
panniers
on
each
flank
of
the
charger
and
taking
with
them
some
food
for
the
journey
set
off
hildegund
took
the
reins
walthar
in
full
armour
sitting
behind
her
all
night
they
did
not
draw
rein
and
during
the
day
they
hid
in
the
gloomy
woods
at
every
breath
at
the
snapping
of
a
twig
or
the
chirping
of
a
bird
hildegund
trembled
they
avoided
the
habitations
of
men
and
skirted
the
mountains
where
but
few
faces
were
to
be
seen
and
so
they
made
good
their
flight
but
the
huns
roused
from
their
drunken
sleep
gazed
around
stupidly
and
cried
loudly
for
walthar
their
boon
companion
as
they
thought
but
nowhere
was
he
to
be
found
the
queen
too
missed
hildegund
and
realizing
that
the
pair
had
escaped
made
loud
wail
through
the
palace
angry
and
bewildered
attila
could
touch
neither
food
nor
drink
enraged
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
deceived
he
offered
great
gifts
to
him
who
would
bring
back
walthar
in
chains
but
none
of
the
hunnish
champions
considered
themselves
fit
for
such
a
task
and
at
length
the
hue
and
cry
ceased
and
walthar
and
hildegund
were
left
to
make
their
way
back
to
aquitaine
as
best
they
could
full
of
the
thought
that
they
were
being
pursued
walthar
and
the
maiden
fled
onward
he
killed
the
birds
of
the
wood
and
caught
fish
to
supply
them
with
food
his
attitude
to
hildegund
was
one
of
the
deepest
chivalry
and
he
was
ever
mindful
for
her
comfort
fourteen
days
had
passed
when
at
last
issuing
from
the
darkness
of
the
forest
they
beheld
the
silver
rhine
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
and
spied
the
towers
of
worms
at
length
he
found
a
ferry
but
fearing
to
make
gossip
in
the
vicinity
he
paid
the
ferryman
with
fishes
which
he
had
previously
caught
the
ferryman
as
it
chanced
sold
the
fish
to
the
cook
who
dressed
them
and
placed
them
before
his
royal
master
the
monarch
declared
that
there
were
no
such
fishes
in
france
and
asked
who
had
brought
them
to
worms
the
ferryman
was
summoned
and
related
how
he
had
ferried
over
an
armed
warrior
a
fair
maiden
and
a
great
with
two
chests
hagen
who
sat
at
the
table
exclaimed
full
joyfully
will
i
avow
that
this
is
none
other
than
my
comrade
walthar
returning
from
the
hunnish
ye
so
retorted
king
gunther
is
clear
that
by
him
the
almighty
sends
me
back
the
treasure
of
my
father
so
ordered
he
a
horse
to
be
brought
and
taking
with
him
twelve
of
his
bravest
chiefs
besides
hagen
who
sought
in
vain
to
dissuade
him
he
went
in
search
of
walthar
the
cave
journeying
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
walthar
and
the
maiden
had
by
this
time
reached
the
forest
of
the
vosges
they
halted
at
a
spot
where
between
two
hills
standing
close
together
is
situated
a
pleasant
and
shady
cave
not
hollowed
out
in
the
earth
but
formed
by
the
beetling
of
the
rocks
a
fit
haunt
for
bandits
carpeted
with
green
moss
but
little
sleep
had
walthar
known
since
his
escape
from
the
hunland
so
spying
this
cool
retreat
he
crept
inside
it
to
rest
putting
off
his
heavy
armour
he
placed
his
head
on
lap
bidding
her
keep
watch
and
wake
him
by
a
touch
if
she
saw
aught
of
danger
but
the
covetous
gunther
had
seen
his
tracks
in
the
dust
and
ever
urging
on
his
companions
soon
came
near
the
cave
where
walthar
reposed
hagen
warned
him
of
powers
as
a
champion
and
told
him
that
he
was
too
great
a
warrior
to
permit
himself
to
be
despoiled
easily
hildegund
noticing
their
approach
gently
aroused
walthar
who
put
on
his
armour
at
first
she
thought
the
approaching
band
were
huns
pursuing
them
and
implored
him
to
slay
her
but
walthar
smilingly
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
as
he
had
recognized
helm
he
was
evidently
aware
however
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
been
followed
and
going
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
addressed
the
assembled
warriors
telling
them
that
no
frank
should
ever
return
to
say
that
he
had
taken
aught
of
his
treasure
unpunished
hagen
advised
a
parley
in
case
walthar
should
be
ready
to
give
up
the
treasure
without
bloodshed
and
camillo
the
prefect
of
metz
was
sent
to
him
for
this
purpose
camillo
told
him
that
if
he
would
give
up
his
charger
the
two
chests
and
the
maiden
gunther
would
grant
him
life
but
walthar
laughed
in
his
face
tell
king
gunther
he
said
if
he
will
not
oppose
my
passage
i
will
present
him
with
one
hundred
armlets
of
red
hagen
strongly
advised
the
king
to
accept
the
offer
for
on
the
night
before
he
had
had
an
evil
dream
of
a
bear
which
tore
off
one
of
the
legs
in
conflict
and
put
out
one
of
his
own
eyes
when
he
came
to
aid
gunther
replied
with
a
sneer
and
hagen
greatly
humiliated
declared
that
he
would
share
neither
the
fight
nor
the
spoil
is
your
foe
he
said
will
stay
here
and
see
how
you
fare
at
his
now
only
one
warrior
could
attack
walthar
at
a
time
it
is
needless
to
go
into
details
of
his
several
conflicts
which
are
varied
with
very
considerable
skill
and
fancy
but
all
of
which
end
in
his
triumph
the
sixth
champion
he
had
to
meet
was
patavrid
son
to
hagen
who
vainly
endeavoured
to
restrain
him
but
who
also
was
worsted
and
after
the
fall
of
the
next
warrior
the
franks
themselves
urged
gunther
to
end
the
combat
but
he
furious
at
his
want
of
success
only
drove
them
to
it
the
more
vehemently
at
last
four
of
them
made
a
combined
attack
on
walthar
but
because
of
the
narrowness
of
the
path
they
could
not
come
at
him
with
any
better
success
than
could
one
single
warrior
and
they
too
were
put
out
of
the
fight
then
gunther
was
left
alone
and
fleeing
to
hagen
besought
him
to
come
to
his
aid
long
did
hagen
resist
his
entreaties
but
at
last
he
was
moved
by
description
of
the
manner
in
which
his
kinsfolk
had
been
slain
by
walthar
advice
was
to
lure
walthar
into
the
open
when
both
should
attack
him
so
hagen
and
the
king
departed
and
selected
a
spot
for
an
ambush
letting
their
horses
go
loose
uncertain
of
what
had
passed
between
hagen
and
the
king
walthar
decided
upon
remaining
in
the
cave
till
the
morning
so
after
placing
bushes
around
the
mouth
of
the
cave
to
guard
against
a
surprise
he
gave
thanks
to
heaven
for
his
victory
rising
from
his
knees
he
bound
together
the
six
horses
which
remained
then
loosing
his
armour
comforted
hildegund
as
best
he
might
and
refreshed
himself
with
food
after
which
he
lay
down
upon
his
shield
and
requested
the
maiden
to
watch
during
his
sleep
although
she
was
tired
herself
hildegund
kept
awake
by
singing
in
a
low
tone
after
his
first
sleep
walthar
rose
refreshed
and
bidding
hildegund
rest
herself
he
stood
leaning
upon
his
spear
keeping
guard
at
the
when
morning
had
come
he
loaded
four
of
the
horses
with
spoils
taken
from
the
dead
warriors
and
placing
hildegund
on
the
fifth
mounted
the
sixth
himself
then
with
great
caution
he
sent
forward
first
of
all
the
four
laden
horses
then
the
maiden
and
closed
the
rear
with
the
horse
bearing
the
two
for
about
a
mile
they
proceeded
thus
when
looking
backward
hildegund
espied
two
men
riding
down
the
hill
toward
them
and
called
to
walthar
to
flee
but
that
he
would
not
do
saying
honour
falls
shame
shall
attend
my
last
he
bade
her
take
the
reins
of
lion
his
good
charger
which
carried
the
gold
and
seek
refuge
in
the
neighbouring
wood
while
he
ascended
the
hill
to
await
his
enemies
gunther
advanced
hurling
insulting
epithets
at
the
champion
who
ignored
him
but
turned
to
hagen
appealing
to
their
old
friendship
and
to
the
recollections
of
the
many
hours
of
childhood
they
had
spent
together
he
had
thought
that
hagen
would
have
been
the
first
to
welcome
him
would
have
compelled
him
to
accept
his
hospitality
and
would
have
escorted
him
peacefully
to
his
kingdom
if
he
would
break
his
fealty
to
gunther
said
walthar
he
should
depart
rich
his
shield
full
of
red
gold
irritated
at
such
an
offer
hagen
replied
that
he
would
not
be
deluded
and
that
for
slaying
of
his
kinsmen
he
must
have
vengeance
so
saying
he
hurled
his
spear
at
walthar
which
the
latter
avoided
gunther
then
cast
a
shaft
which
was
equally
harmless
then
drawing
their
swords
and
covering
themselves
with
their
shields
the
franks
sought
to
close
with
the
aquitainian
who
kept
them
at
bay
with
his
spear
as
their
shorter
swords
could
not
reach
past
mighty
shaft
gunther
attempted
to
recover
the
spear
which
he
had
cast
and
which
lay
before
the
feet
and
told
hagen
to
go
in
front
but
as
he
was
about
to
pick
it
up
from
the
ground
walthar
perceived
his
device
and
placing
his
foot
upon
it
flung
gunther
on
his
knees
and
would
have
slain
him
had
not
hagen
rushing
to
his
aid
managed
to
cover
him
with
his
shield
the
struggle
continued
the
hot
sunshine
came
down
and
the
champions
were
bathed
in
sweat
walthar
tired
of
the
strife
took
the
offensive
and
springing
at
hagen
with
a
great
stroke
of
his
spear
carried
away
a
part
of
his
armour
then
with
a
marvellous
blow
of
his
sword
he
smote
off
the
leg
as
far
as
the
thigh
he
would
have
dispatched
him
with
a
second
blow
but
hagen
threw
himself
over
body
and
received
the
on
his
own
head
so
well
tempered
was
his
helm
that
the
blade
flew
in
flinders
shivered
to
the
handle
instantly
walthar
looked
about
him
for
another
weapon
but
quick
as
thought
hagen
seized
the
opportunity
and
cut
off
his
right
hand
to
peoples
and
but
undismayed
the
hero
inserted
the
wounded
stump
into
the
shield
and
drawing
with
his
left
hand
a
hunnish
girt
to
his
right
side
he
struck
at
hagen
so
fiercely
that
he
bereft
him
of
his
right
eye
cutting
deep
into
the
temple
and
lips
and
striking
out
six
of
his
teeth
but
neither
might
fight
more
leg
hand
and
eye
lay
on
the
ground
they
sat
down
on
the
heath
and
stanched
with
flowers
the
flowing
stream
of
their
blood
they
called
to
them
hildegund
who
bound
up
their
wounds
and
brought
them
wine
wounded
as
they
were
they
cracked
many
a
joke
over
their
cups
as
heroes
should
said
hagen
thou
huntest
the
stag
of
whose
leather
mayest
thou
have
gloves
without
end
i
warn
thee
to
fill
thy
glove
with
soft
wool
that
thou
mayest
deceive
the
game
with
the
semblance
of
a
hand
but
what
sayest
thou
to
break
the
custom
of
thy
people
in
carrying
thy
sword
at
thy
right
side
and
embracing
thy
wife
with
thy
left
arm
retorted
walthar
laughing
grimly
wilt
have
to
greet
the
troops
of
heroes
with
a
side
glance
when
thou
gettest
thee
home
make
thee
a
larded
broth
of
milk
and
flour
which
will
both
nourish
and
cure
then
they
placed
on
horseback
the
king
who
was
in
sore
pain
hagen
bore
him
back
to
worms
whilst
walthar
and
hildegund
pursued
their
way
to
aquitaine
and
on
arrival
magnificently
celebrated
their
wedding
for
thirty
years

heidelberg
is
known
all
over
the
world
as
one
of
great
university
towns
as
the
site
of
an
unrivalled

ruined
schloss
and
of
a
view
at
the
junction
of
the
rhine
with
the
neckar
which
is
one
of
the
most
famous
in
the
world
it
lies
between
lofty
hills
covered
with
vineyards
and
forests
flanked
by
handsome
villas
and
gardens
and
is
crowned
by
its
castle

from

and

elements
being
partially
blown
up
by

and
struck
by
lightning
in
the
spring
the
name
of
jette
a
beautiful
prophetess
of
the
ancient
goddess
herthe
is
linked
with
the
neighbourhood
of
heidelberg
by
the
following
tragic
tale
when
the
old
heathen
gods
and
goddesses
were
still
worshipped
in
the
rhine
country
a
certain
priestess
of
herthe
took
up
her
abode
in
an
ancient
grove
where
she
practised
her
occult
arts
so
successfully
that
the
fame
of
her
divinations
spread
far
and
wide
and
men
came
from
all
parts
of
europe
to
learn
from
her
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
them
frequently
a
warrior
left
her
abode
with
a
consuming
fire
kindled
in
his
breast
which
would
rob
him
of
sleep
for
many
a
long
night
yet
none
dared
to
declare
his
love
to
her
for
lovely
though
she
was
there
was
an
air
of
austerity
an
atmosphere
of
mysticism
about
her
which
commanded
awe
and
reverence
and
forbade
even
the
smallest
familiarity
one
evening
there
came
to
the
grove
of
herthe
a
youth
from
a
far
distant
land
seeking
to
know
his
destiny
all
day
he
had
journeyed
thitherward
and
the
dusk
had
already
fallen
ere
he
reached
the
sacred
spot
jette
sat
on
the
glimmering
clad
in
a
flowing
white
robe
while
on
the
altar
itself
burned
a
faint
and
fitful
flame
the
tall
slender
trees
showing
fantastic
and
ghostly
in
the
fading
light
made
a
fitting
background
for
the
gleaming
shrine
and
the
elusive
unearthly
beauty
of
the
priestess
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
magic
scene
her
mantle
of
austerity
had
fallen
from
her
she
had
forgotten
that
she
was
a
prophetess
for
the
moment
she
was
but
a
woman
full
of
grace
and
charm
the
youth
paused
as
though
held
by
a
spell
prophetess
he
said
in
a
low
voice
fearing
to
break
in
rudely
upon
her
meditations
thou
read
me
my
fate
jette
roused
from
her
reverie
fixed
her
startled
gaze
on
the
handsome
stranger
whose
dark
burning
eyes
met
hers
in
deepest
admiration
something
stirred
in
her
heart
at
the
ardent
glance
the
thrilling
tones
and
her
wonted
composure
deserted
her
she
faltered
at
length
comest
at
a
time
when
my
prophetic
skill
hath
failed
me
ere
i
tell
thee
thy
fate
i
must
offer
sacrifice
to
herthe
if
thou
wilt
come
at
this
hour
i
will
tell
thee
what
the
stars
say
concerning
thy
it
was
true
that
her
skill
had
deserted
her
under
the
admiring
scrutiny
of
the
young
warrior
yet
she
delayed
also
because
she
wished
to
hear
his
voice
again
to
meet
the
ardent
yet
courteous
glance
of
his
dark
eyes
will
return
o
prophetess
said
he
and
with
that
he
was
gone
peace
of
mind
had
gone
too
it
seemed
for
she
could
think
of
naught
but
the
handsome
stranger
on
the
following
evening
he
returned
and
again
she
delayed
to
give
him
the
information
he
sought
he
was
no
less
rejoiced
than
was
jette
at
the
prospect
of
another
meeting
on
the
third
day
the
priestess
greeted
him
with
downcast
eyes
can
not
read
thy
destiny
youth
she
said
stars
do
not
speak
plainly
yet
methinks
thy
star
and
mine
are
very
close
she
faltered
and
paused
thou
love
me
jette
cried
the
young
man
joyfully
thou
be
my
bride
the
blushing
cheeks
and
downcast
glance
were
sufficient
answer
wilt
thou
come
with
me
to
my
tower
pursued
the
youth
eagerly
jette
started
back
in
affright
that
i
can
not
she
cried
priestess
of
herthe
is
doomed
an
she
marry
if
i
wed
thee
we
must
meet
in
secret
and
at
i
will
take
thee
to
walhalla
and
freya
shall
appease
herthe
with
her
jette
shook
her
head
said
she
is
impossible
the
vengeance
of
herthe
is
awful
i
will
show
thee
a
spring
where
we
may
she
led
him
to
a
place
where
the
stream
branched
off
in
five
separate
rivulets
and
bade
him
meet
her
there
on
the
following
night
at
a
certain
hour
the
lovers
then
parted
each
full
of
impatience
for
the
return
of
the
hour
of
meeting
next
evening
when
the
dusk
had
fallen
on
the
sacred
grove
of
herthe
jette
made
her
way
to
the
rendezvous
the
appointed
time
had
not
yet
arrived
but
scarcely
had
she
reached
the
spot
ere
she
fancied
she
heard
a
step
among
the
undergrowth
and
turned
with
a
glad
smile
prepared
to
greet
her
lover
imagine
her
dismay
when
instead
of
the
youth
a
grisly
wolf
confronted
her
her
shriek
of
terror
was
uttered
in
vain
a
moment
later
the
monster
had
sprung
at
her
throat
her
lover
hastening
with
eager
steps
toward
the
place
of
meeting
heard
the
agonized
shriek
and
recognizing
the
voice
of
jette
broke
into
a
run
he
was
too
late
the
monster
wolf
stood
over
the
lifeless
body
of
his
beloved
and
though
in
his
despairing
fury
the
youth
slew
the
huge
brute
the
retribution
of
herthe
was
complete
henceforth
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
was
called
the
spring
and
the
legend
is
enshrined
there
to
this
day
the
jester
of
heidelberg
considering
the
wide
fame
of
rhenish
vintages
it
is
perhaps
not
surprising
that
wine
should
enter
as
largely
into
the
rhine
legends
as
the
is
supposed
to
enter
into
scottish
anecdote
in
truth
there
runs
through
these
traditions
a
stream
of
rhenish
which
plays
almost
as
important
a
part
in
them
as
the
rhine
itself
we
are
told
that
the
emperor
wenzel
sold
his
crown
for
a
quantity
of
wine
in
the
tale
connected
with
thann
in
alsace
mortar
is
mixed
with
wine
instead
of
water
because
of
the
scarcity
of
the
latter
commodity
during
the
building
of
a
steeple
while
in
the
legends
of
vineyard
and
cooper
of
the
vintage
of
rhineland
provides
the
main
interest
of
the
plot
the
following
quaint
little
story
attaching
to
the
castle
of
heidelberg
is
a
tale
in
every
sense
of
the
word
in
the
days
when
the
schloss
heidelberg
was
in
its
most
flourishing
state
the
lord
of
the
castle
numbered
among
his
retainers
a
jester
small
of
stature
and
ugly
of
feature
whose
quips
and
drolleries
provided
endless
amusement
for
himself
and
his
guests
prominent
among
the
characteristics
was
a
weakness
for
getting
tipsy
he
was
possessed
of
an
unquenchable
thirst
which
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
satisfying
knowing
his
peculiarity
some
youthful
pages
in
the
train
of
the
nobleman
were
minded
to
have
some
amusement
at
his
expense
and
they
therefore
led
him
to
a
cellar
in
which
stood
a
large
vat
filled
with
fragrant
wine
and
there
for
a
time
they
left
him
the
jester
was
delighted
at
the
propinquity
of
his
favourite
beverage
and
decided
that
he
would
always
remain
in
the
cellar
regaling
himself
with
the
vintage
his
thirst
increased
at
the
prospect
so
he
produced
a
gimlet
bored
a
hole
in
the
vat
and
drank
and
drank
till
at
length
he
could
drink
no
more
then
the
fumes
of
the
wine
overcame
him
and
he
sank
down
in
a
drunken
stupor
meanwhile
the
merry
little
stream
flowed
from
the
vat
covered
the
floor
of
the
cellar
and
rose
ever
higher
the
pages
waited
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
listening
for
the
bursts
of
merriment
which
were
the
usual
accompaniments
of
the
drinking
bouts
but
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
at
last
they
grew
uneasy
and
crept
below
in
a
huddled
group
the
fool
lay
quite
still
submerged
beneath
the
flood
he
had
been
drowned
in
the
wine
the
joke
now
seemed
a
sorry
one
but
the
pages
consoled
themselves
with
the
thought
that
after
all
death
had
come
to
the
jester
in
a
welcome
guise
the
passing
bells
there
is
a
legend
connected
with
the
town
of
speyer
in
which
poetic
justice
is
meted
out
to
the
principal
characters
although
not
until
after
they
have
died
the
tale
concerns
itself
with
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
monarch
henry
iv
history
relates
that
henry
was
entirely
unfit
to
wear
the
ermine
but
weak
as
he
was
and
ignominious
as
was
his
reign
it
was
a
bitter
blow
that
his
own
son
was
foremost
among
his
enemies
at
first
the
younger
henry
conspired
against
his
father
in
secret
outwardly
he
was
a
model
of
filial
affection
so
that
he
readily
prevailed
upon
the
weak
monarch
to
appoint
him
as
his
successor
after
that
however
he
openly
joined
himself
to
his
foes
and
when
the
pope
excommunicated
the
monarch
gradually
the
following
went
over
to
the
side
of
his
son
who
then
caused
himself
to
be
invested
with
imperial
honours
the
deposed
sovereign
deprived
of
power
and
supporters
was
compelled
to
go
into
exile
even
his
personal
freedom
was
secured
only
as
the
price
of
his
renunciation
of
the
crown
broken
and
humiliated
feeling
intensely
the
disgrace
of
his
position
he
determined
to
undertake
a
pilgrimage
to
liége
accompanied
only
by
his
servant
kurt
who
alone
of
all
his
train
had
remained
faithful
to
him
the
pilgrimage
was
successfully
accomplished
but
ere
he
could
enter
upon
the
return
journey
the
wretched
emperor
died
in
want
and
misery
utterly
neglected
by
his
kindred
even
after
death
the
ban
was
effective
so
that
his
corpse
was
not
allowed
interment
for
several
years
during
that
period
the
faithful
kurt
kept
guard
unceasingly
over
his
coffin
and
would
not
suffer
himself
to
be
drawn
therefrom
at
length
however
henry
v
under
pressure
from
his
princes
and
nobles
gave
orders
that
his
remains
be
conveyed
to
speyer
and
there
interred
in
the
royal
vault
with
such
honours
as
befitted
the
obsequies
of
a
monarch
the
messengers
found
old
kurt
still
holding
his
vigil
beside
the
body
and
in
recognition
of
his
faithfulness
he
was
permitted
to
follow
the
funeral
cortege
to
speyer
there
were
in
the
town
certain
good
and
pious
folk
who
were
touched
by
the
devotion
and
by
these
he
was
kindly
treated
but
all
their
kindness
and
attention
could
not
repair
the
havoc
which
his
weary
vigil
and
long
privations
had
wrought
on
his
health
and
a
few
months
later
he
followed
his
master
to
the
grave
strange
to
relate
as
he
expired
all
the
bells
of
speyer
tolled
out
a
funeral
peal
such
as
was
accorded
to
an
emperor
and
that
without
being
touched
by
human
hands
meanwhile
henry
v
also
lay
dying
all
the
luxury
of
his
palace
could
not
soothe
his
last
moments
though
he
was
surrounded
by
courtiers
who
assumed
sorrow
and
walked
softly
and
though
all
his
kindred
were
around
him
he
saw
ever
before
him
the
image
of
his
dead
father
pointing
at
him
with
a
grim
accusing
finger
stricken
with
terror
and
remorse
and
tortured
by
disease
he
longed
for
death
to
end
his
torments
and
at
last
it
came
again
the
passing
bell
was
tolled
by
invisible
hands
but
not
this
time
the
peal
which
announced
the
passing
of
an
emperor
the
citizens
heard
the
awful
sound
which
told
that
a
criminal
had
paid
the
last
penalty
and
asked
one
another
what
poor
wretch
had
been
executed
awe
and
astonishment
seized
upon
everyone
when
it
was
known
that
the
emperor
had
died
for
they
knew
then
that
it
was
no
earthly
hand
that
had
rung
his
legends
of
windeck
concerning
the
neighbourhood
of
windeck
some
eight
miles
from
baden
several
interesting
tales
are
current
the
castle
itself
has
long
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
beautiful
girl
though
when
or
wherefore
this
originated
tradition
does
not
relate
we
are
told
that
a
young
huntsman
whom
the
chase
had
driven
thitherward
saw
the
spectre
and
was
so
stricken
with
her
charms
that
day
after
day
he
visited
the
castle
hoping
to
see
her
once
more
but
being
disappointed
he
at
length
took
up
his
solitary
abode
in
the
deserted
fortress
renouncing
his
former
pursuits
and
ceasing
from
all
communication
with
his
friends
one
day
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
with
so
peaceful
an
expression
of
countenance
that
those
who
saw
him
could
not
doubt
that
his
end
had
been
a
pleasant
one
on
his
finger
was
a
ring
of
quaint
design
which
he
had
not
been
known
to
wear
and
it
was
whispered
among
the
peasantry
that
the
of
windeck
had
claimed
her
lover
the
hennegraben
hard
by
the
schloss
windeck
lay
a
deep
trench
known
as
the
hennegraben
of
which
traces
may
still
be
found
it
is
rendered
immortal
by
reason
of
the
following
romantic
legend
which
tells
of
its
magical
origin
a
certain
young
knight
lord
of
the
castle
of
windeck
for
some
unknown
reason
had
seized
and
imprisoned
the
worthy
dean
of
strassburg
it
is
true
that
the
churchman
was
treated
with
every
consideration
more
like
a
guest
than
a
captive
but
he
nevertheless
resented
strongly
the
loss
of
his
liberty
as
did
also
the
good
folk
of
strassburg
when
they
learned
what
had
happened
two
of
the
young
kinsfolk
resolved
to
journey
to
windeck
and
beg
that
their
uncle
might
be
set
free
on
their
way
thither
they
had
to
pass
through
a
forest
where
they
met
an
old
woman
away
my
pretty
boys
said
she
you
not
tell
an
old
gossip
your
destination
the
elder
of
the
two
replied
courteously
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
windeck
where
their
uncle
was
imprisoned
he
added
timidly
lord
may
accept
us
as
hostages
till
the
ransom
be
mimicked
the
old
woman
perchance
think
you
the
knight
of
windeck
will
take
such
lads
as
you
are
for
hostages
and
in
truth
they
were
not
an
imposing
elder
a
slim
fragile
youth
whose
eyes
were
already
tearful
at
the
prospect
of
confronting
his
captor
while
the
younger
was
a
mere
boy
sanguine
and
adventuresome
as
children
often
are
will
challenge
this
knight
said
the
boy
seriously
will
draw
sword
for
my
uncle
for
i
also
am
a
cuno
said
his
brother
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
ardour
must
not
talk
of
fighting
we
must
entreat
the
knight
to
let
our
uncle
go
would
you
have
imma
entreat
nay
that
we
shall
he
stopped
awkwardly
and
his
rising
colour
showed
plainly
her
embarrassment
at
having
her
sex
thus
suddenly
revealed
the
old
woman
looked
at
her
kindly
knew
from
the
first
that
thou
wert
a
maid
disguised
she
said
and
god
speed
you
tell
the
knight
of
windeck
that
the
people
of
strassburg
mean
to
attack
his
castle
on
the
morrow
and
that
his
only
means
of
resisting
them
is
to
dig
a
deep
trench
across
the
one
possible
approach
but
is
no
time
for
that
i
will
give
you
something
wherewith
to
dig
the
she
whistled
shrilly
and
in
answer
to
her
call
a
grey
hen
fluttered
toward
her
this
she
gave
to
the
young
people
the
moon
rises
she
said
the
hen
and
place
it
where
you
wish
the
trench
to
then
with
a
few
words
to
the
hen
in
a
strange
tongue
she
bade
the
brother
and
sister
farewell
and
went
on
her
way
the
two
continued
their
journey
and
upon
arriving
at
windeck
they
were
agreeably
surprised
in
the
lord
of
the
castle
for
he
was
young
and
handsome
and
very
courteous
not
at
all
the
ogre
they
had
imagined
in
faltering
tones
imma
told
him
their
mission
conveyed
to
him
the
old
warning
and
presented
the
grey
hen
when
he
heard
that
they
proposed
to
gain
their
freedom
by
themselves
taking
his
place
the
knight
regarded
his
visitors
with
mingled
feelings
of
pity
and
astonishment
the
gentle
appealing
glance
of
the
elder
no
less
than
the
naive
candour
of
the
younger
appealed
to
his
sympathies
in
a
very
short
time
cuno
who
had
quite
forgotten
to
challenge
his
host
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
him
meanwhile
the
dean
very
impatient
and
incensed
paced
his
small
chamber
like
a
caged
lion
or
bemoaned
his
lost
liberty
and
meditated
on
the
chances
of
escape
he
was
roused
from
a
reverie
by
the
sound
of
familiar
voices
outside
his
cell
and
a
moment
later
the
door
was
flung
open
and
cuno
entered
unceremoniously
are
free
uncle
you
are
free
imma
and
i
have
come
to
save
you
once
more
imma
flushed
crimson
at
the
revelation
of
her
sex
the
astonished
knight
glanced
with
a
new
interest
at
her
beautiful
face
with
its
rosy
colour
and
downcast
eyes
turning
to
the
dean
he
greeted
him
cordially
are
free
he
said
nephews
have
promised
to
remain
with
me
as
hostages
till
you
have
provided
a
ransom
then
turning
humorously
to
imma
he
added
thou
be
a
soldier
in
my
employ
youth
or
wouldst
have
a
place
in
my
household
imma
vouchsafed
no
other
reply
than
a
deepening
of
her
colour
she
must
however
have
found
words
to
utter
when
later
the
gallant
knight
begged
her
seriously
to
remain
at
windeck
as
his
ere
nightfall
the
old
dean
grumbling
and
somewhat
reluctant
was
called
upon
to
consent
to
his
betrothal
this
he
did
at
length
when
imma
had
joined
her
entreaties
to
those
of
her
lover
that
night
the
grey
hen
was
placed
as
the
witch
had
advised
and
it
was
as
she
had
said
with
the
dawn
the
strassburgers
arrived
before
the
castle
to
find
a
newly
made
trench
filled
with
the
castle
troopers
when
they
learned
that
the
dean
was
free
they
called
for
a
truce
and
it
was
not
blood
but
wine
which
flowed
that
day
for
all
were
invited
to
share
the
of
imma
and
the
knight
of
windeck
the
klingelkapelle
on
the
road
between
gernsbach
and
eberstein
there
once
stood
an
ancient
cell
it
had
been
occupied
by
a
beautiful
pagan
priestess
a
devotee
of
herthe
but
when
the
preaching
of
the
white
monks
had
begun
to
spread
christianity
among
the
people
she
left
the
neighbourhood
in
passing
by
that
way
a
christian
monk
noticed
the
deserted
retreat
and
took
possession
of
it
issuing
at
intervals
to
preach
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
country
one
stormy
night
as
he
sat
within
his
cell
he
fancied
he
heard
a
pleading
voice
mingling
with
the
roar
of
wind
and
waters
going
to
the
door
he
beheld
a
young
girl
who
seemed
to
be
half
dead
with
cold
and
fatigue
the
good
monk
who
was
never
indifferent
to
human
suffering
drew
her
quickly
inside
bade
her
seat
herself
by
the
fire
and
set
food
and
wine
before
her
when
she
had
recovered
a
little
from
the
effects
of
the
storm
the
hermit
questioned
her
with
regard
to
her
presence
in
such
a
lonely
spot
and
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
the
maid
replied
that
she
had
once
dwelt
in
just
such
a
pleasant
and
peaceful
cell
as
that
in
which
she
now
reposed
but
that
cruel
persecution
had
driven
her
from
her
retreat
you
too
are
a
hermit
said
the
young
monk
inquiringly
looking
down
at
his
fair
guest
the
wine
had
brought
some
colour
to
her
pale
cheeks
and
he
could
see
that
she
was
beautiful
with
a
beauty
beyond
that
of
any
maiden
he
had
ever
seen
she
replied
am
a
priestess
of
herthe
this
cell
in
which
i
beg
for
shelter
was
once
my
own
it
was
those
of
your
religion
who
drove
me
from
are
not
a
christian
asked
the
monk
startled
in
spite
of
himself
by
the
passionate
tones
in
which
she
spoke
the
maiden
laughed
i
not
as
beautiful
as
your
christian
maids
said
she
i
not
human
even
as
they
are
she
moved
about
the
cell
as
she
spoke
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
embroidery
this
is
my
handiwork
is
it
less
beautiful
because
it
is
not
the
work
of
a
christian
why
should
we
suffer
persecution
at
your
hands
the
young
monk
endeavoured
to
show
that
she
was
unjust
in
her
estimate
of
his
religion
gravely
he
told
her
the
story
of
christianity
but
his
thoughts
were
of
her
weird
beauty
and
he
spake
less
earnestly
than
was
usual
and
the
maid
with
an
appearance
of
innocence
waited
until
he
had
finished
his
recital
she
saw
that
she
had
him
completely
in
her
power
and
pressed
her
advantage
to
the
uttermost
she
drew
closer
to
him
raised
his
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
the
monk
surrendered
himself
to
her
caresses
and
when
at
length
she
begged
him
to
break
the
symbol
of
his
religion
he
was
too
much
fascinated
to
refuse
he
raised
the
cross
and
would
have
dashed
it
to
the
ground
but
at
that
very
moment
he
heard
high
above
the
storm
the
sound
of
a
bell
contrite
and
ashamed
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
for
pardon
when
he
looked
up
again
the
girl
had
disappeared
the
hermit
found
the
warning
bell
suspended
on
a
bough
outside
his
cell
how
it
came
there
he
never
knew
but
he
was
sure
that
it
had
been
sent
to
rescue
him
from
the
wiles
of
satan
and
he
treasured
it
as
a
sacred
relic
many
came
from
far
and
near
to
see
the
wonder
and
on
the
site
of
the
cell
the
monk
founded
a
chapel
which
became
known
as
the
klingelkapelle
or
the
of
staufenberg
a
charming
story
is
linked
with
the
castle
of
staufenberg
one
day
while
its
owner
was
out
hunting
he
lost
his
way
in
the
forest
the
day
was
hot
and
the
hunter
was
overcome
with
thirst
and
fatigue
when
he
entered
a
pleasant
glade
in
which
a
spring
of
limpid
water
bubbled
and
sparkled
having
quenched
his
thirst
he
seated
himself
on
a
mossy
bank
to
rest
before
proceeding
homeward
suddenly
he
saw
at
a
little
distance
a
damsel
of
unique
and
marvellous
beauty
braiding
her
wet
hair
by
the
side
of
the
spring
he
watched
her
for
a
time
in
silence
then
conscious
that
the
damsel
had
observed
his
scrutiny
he
hastened
to
her
side
and
courteously
begged
her
permission
to
remain
a
little
longer
in
the
glade
are
the
lord
of
these
domains
she
replied
graciously
is
i
who
am
grateful
to
you
for
suffering
me
to
dwell
the
young
knight
protested
eagerly
that
she
honoured
the
forest
with
her
presence
and
indeed
he
had
already
begun
to
wish
that
she
might
dwell
not
only
in
the
forest
but
in
the
schloss
itself
as
his
wife
and
its
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
indeed
so
ardent
was
his
passion
that
he
could
not
conceal
his
infatuation
he
told
her
of
his
love
and
begged
that
she
would
give
him
a
little
hope
the
hesitation
only
drove
him
to
urge
his
suit
with
increasing
ardour
will
say
neither
nor
she
replied
smiling
me
at
this
hour
and
you
shall
have
your
the
knight
parted
reluctantly
from
the
fair
lady
and
promised
to
return
on
the
following
day
when
the
appointed
time
arrived
he
was
already
at
the
tryst
eagerly
awaiting
the
approach
of
his
beloved
when
at
length
she
came
he
renewed
his
pleadings
with
even
greater
ardour
and
to
his
unbounded
delight
the
answer
was
favourable
am
a
said
the
lady
spirit
of
the
stream
from
which
you
drank
yesterday
you
saw
me
then
for
the
first
time
but
i
have
often
seen
you
in
the
i
have
long
loved
the
knight
was
more
than
ever
enchanted
by
this
naive
confession
and
begged
that
their
wedding
should
not
be
long
delayed
is
one
condition
said
the
nymph
you
marry
me
you
must
remain
for
ever
faithful
otherwise
you
must
suffer
death
and
i
eternal
the
knight
laughed
at
the
bare
idea
of
his
proving
unfaithful
to
his
beloved
and
his
vows
were
sincere
shortly
afterward
they
were
married
and
none
supposed
the
beautiful
being
to
be
aught
but
a
very
attractive
woman
in
time
there
was
born
to
them
a
little
son
the
knight
adored
both
wife
and
child
and
for
some
years
lived
a
life
of
ideal
domestic
happiness
but
there
came
a
time
when
another
interest
entered
into
his
life
rumours
of
fighting
reached
him
from
france
he
saw
the
knights
of
neighbouring
fortresses
leading
their
troops
to
the
war
and
a
martial
spirit
stirred
within
him
his
wife
was
not
slow
to
observe
that
his
world
was
no
longer
bounded
by
the
of
staufenberg
and
she
wisely
resolved
not
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
ambitions
but
rather
if
possible
to
help
them
to
an
honourable
realization
so
with
much
labour
and
skill
she
made
him
a
strangely
wrought
belt
which
she
gave
him
at
once
as
a
and
a
charm
to
secure
success
in
battle
she
concealed
her
grief
at
his
departure
and
bade
him
farewell
bravely
at
the
head
of
his
troop
the
knight
rode
boldly
into
france
and
offered
his
services
to
a
distinguished
french
leader
to
whom
he
soon
became
much
so
in
fact
that
the
nobleman
cast
about
for
a
means
of
retaining
permanently
in
his
train
a
knight
of
such
skill
and
courage
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
with
which
to
tempt
the
young
man
who
was
already
possessed
of
gold
and
lands
till
the
artless
glances
of
his
youngest
daughter
gave
him
his
cue
for
he
saw
that
she
had
lately
begun
to
look
with
some
favour
on
the
simple
knight
of
staufenberg
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
hand
of
a
lady
of
rank
and
beauty
would
be
a
very
desirable
bait
nor
was
he
mistaken
for
the
gaieties
of
the
frankish
court
had
dazzled
the
knight
and
the
offer
of
the
hand
completely
turned
his
head
not
that
he
felt
a
great
affection
for
her
but
because
of
the
honour
done
to
him
so
he
accepted
the
offer
and
drowned
as
best
as
he
could
the
remembrance
of
his
wife
and
child
at
staufenberg
nevertheless
he
sometimes
felt
that
he
was
not
acting
honourably
and
at
length
the
struggle
between
his
love
for
his
wife
and
his
pride
and
ambition
became
so
severe
that
he
determined
to
consult
a
priest
the
good
man
crossed
himself
when
he
heard
the
story
whom
you
married
is
an
evil
spirit
said
he
spirits
do
not
wed
human
beings
it
is
your
duty
to
renounce
her
at
once
and
do
penance
for
your
though
he
hardly
found
it
possible
to
believe
the
assertion
the
knight
strove
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
true
and
that
he
was
really
acting
virtuously
in
renouncing
the
and
marrying
again
so
he
performed
the
penances
prescribed
by
the
priest
and
allowed
the
wedding
preparations
to
proceed
when
the
day
of
his
wedding
arrived
however
he
was
strangely
perturbed
and
pale
the
rejoicings
of
the
people
the
gay
processions
even
the
beautiful
bride
seemed
to
have
no
interest
for
him
when
the
hand
of
the
lady
was
placed
in
his
he
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
it
was
cold
to
the
touch
like
the
hand
of
a
corpse
on
returning
the
wedding
procession
was
obliged
to
cross
a
bridge
and
as
they
approached
it
a
great
storm
arose
so
that
the
waters
of
the
stream
washed
over
the
feet
of
the
horse
making
it
prance
and
rear
the
knight
was
stricken
with
deadly
terror
for
he
knew
that
the
doom
of
which
the
had
spoken
was
about
to
overtake
him
without
a
word
he
plunged
into
the
torrent
and
was
nevermore
seen
at
the
very
hour
of
this
tragedy
a
great
storm
raged
round
the
castle
of
staufenberg
and
when
it
abated
the
mother
and
child
had
disappeared
for
ever
yet
even
now
on
a
stormy
night
she
can
still
be
heard
among
the
weeping
passionately
and
the
sound
is
accompanied
by
the
whimpering
of
a
child
trifels
and
richard
as
a
troop
of
horsemen
rode
through
annweiler
toward
the
castle
of
trifels
in
which
richard
was
imprisoned
by
the
archduke
of
austria
his
deadly
enemy
the
plaintive
notes
of
a
familiar
lay
fell
on
their
ears
the
singer
was
a
young
shepherd
and
one
of
the
knights
a
troubadour
asked
him
to
repeat
his
ditty
the
youth
complied
and
the
knight
accompanied
him
as
he
sang
their
voices
blending
tunefully
together
giving
him
generous
largess
the
knight
asked
the
minstrel
who
had
taught
him
that
song
the
shepherd
replied
that
he
had
heard
it
sung
in
the
castle
of
trifels
at
this
intelligence
the
stranger
appeared
highly
gratified
and
turning
to
his
companions
ejaculated
king
is
found
it
was
evident
to
the
shepherd
that
the
were
friends
of
richard
and
he
warned
them
earnestly
that
danger
lay
before
them
only
by
guile
could
they
hope
to
succour
their
king
the
warning
was
heeded
and
the
tuneful
knight
rode
forward
alone
disguised
in
a
tunic
in
which
he
was
welcomed
at
the
castle
his
courtly
bearing
soon
won
him
the
favour
of
the
pretty
niece
who
persuaded
her
uncle
to
listen
to
his
songs
during
one
of
their
stolen
interviews
the
girl
betrayed
the
place
where
the
king
of
england
was
imprisoned
and
that
night
from
beneath
a
window
the
minstrel
heard
his
voice
breathing
a
prayer
for
freedom
his
hopes
being
thus
confirmed
he
took
his
harp
and
played
the
melody
which
he
himself
had
composed
for
richard
the
king
immediately
joined
in
the
familiar
lay
when
its
strains
had
ended
cried
the
captive
excitedly
the
minstrel
cautiously
replied
by
singing
another
song
telling
how
he
was
pledged
to
liberate
his
master
but
suspicion
was
aroused
and
blondel
was
requested
to
depart
on
the
following
day
deeming
it
prudent
to
make
no
demur
he
mounted
his
horse
after
having
arranged
with
the
niece
to
return
secretly
at
nightfall
he
rode
no
further
than
an
inn
near
annweiler
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
castle
there
his
host
informed
him
that
the
emperor
was
presently
to
be
crowned
at
frankfort
and
that
on
the
evening
of
that
day
the
garrison
would
celebrate
the
event
by
drinking
his
health
the
minstrel
said
that
he
would
certainly
join
the
company
ordered
wine
for
the
occasion
and
promised
to
pay
the
reckoning
he
then
withdrew
to
seek
his
comrades
at
dusk
he
returned
stealthily
to
the
castle
and
at
his
signal
the
maid
appeared
at
a
little
postern
and
admitted
him
on
the
day
of
the
coronation
stealthy
forms
crept
among
the
trees
near
by
the
castle
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
thick
foliage
of
the
underbrush
the
garrison
gaily
dressed
quitted
the
keep
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
and
the
men
were
soon
quaffing
the
choice
wine
which
the
stranger
had
ordered
meanwhile
blondel
had
appeared
before
the
postern
and
had
given
his
accustomed
signal
for
a
time
there
was
no
response
and
the
minstrel
was
becoming
impatient
when
the
gate
was
suddenly
opened
and
the
maiden
appeared
the
minstrel
now
told
the
girl
his
reason
for
coming
hither
how
he
hoped
to
liberate
the
captive
monarch
as
a
reward
for
her
connivance
he
promised
to
take
her
with
him
to
england
then
he
beckoned
to
his
friends
there
was
a
sudden
rush
and
armed
forms
thronged
the
postern
the
frightened
maid
dreading
lest
violence
should
overtake
her
uncle
shrieked
loudly
but
her
cries
were
unheeded
and
the
english
knights
pressed
into
the
courtyard
the
assailants
met
with
little
resistance
seized
the
keys
threw
open
the
prison
door
and
liberated
their
king
the
castellan
protested
loudly
and
threatened
richard
with
mighty
words
but
all
to
no
purpose
when
the
garrison
returned
they
were
powerless
to
render
aid
for
the
castellan
was
threatened
with
death
should
his
followers
attack
the
castle
in
the
end
a
truce
was
made
and
the
english
were
allowed
to
retire
unmolested
with
their
king
although
urged
by
him
the
maid
refused
to
accompany
blondel
so
giving
her
a
gold
ring
as
a
memento
he
parted
from
her
returning
again
many
years
afterward
the
minstrel
once
more
heard
the
same
song
which
the
king
had
sung
to
his
harp
in
the
castle
of
trifels
entering
the
inn
he
recognized
in
the
landlord
the
from
him
he
learnt
that
the
castellan
had
perished
by
an
unknown
hand
and
that
his
pretty
niece
having
as
she
thought
plumbed
the
depths
of
masculine
deceit
had
entered
the
nunnery
of
eberstein
at
baden
thann
in
alsace
thann
is
known
to
legend
by
two
things
a
steeple
and
a
field
the
steeple
was
built
in
a
season
of
great
drought
water
had
failed
everywhere
there
was
only
the
thinnest
trickle
from
the
springs
and
fountains
with
which
the
people
might
allay
their
thirst
yet
strangely
the
vineyards
had
yielded
a
wonderful
harvest
of
luscious
grapes
and
the
wine
was
so
abundant
that
the
supply
of
casks
and
vessels
was
insufficient
for
the
demand
therefore
did
it
happen
that
the
mortar
used
for
building
the
steeple
was
mixed
with
wine
wherefore
the
lime
was
changed
to
must
and
it
is
said
that
even
to
this
day
when
the
vines
are
in
blossom
a
delicate
fragrance
steals
from
the
old
steeple
and
on
the
stones
a
purple
dew
is
seen
while
some
declare
that
there
is
a
deeper
tone
in
the
harmony
of
the
bells
the
the
field
is
a
terrible
place
barren
and
desolate
for
it
is
avoided
as
a
spot
accursed
no
living
thing
moves
upon
it
the
earth
is
streaked
with
patches
of
dark
moss
and
drifts
of
ghastly
skulls
like
a
scattered
harvest
of
death
once
says
the
legend
a
wayfarer
surprised
by
the
night
lost
himself
on
the
plain
as
he
stumbled
in
the
darkness
he
heard
the
clocks
of
the
town
near
by
strike
the
hour
of
midnight
at
this
the
stillness
about
the
wanderer
was
broken
under
his
feet
the
earth
seemed
to
tremble
there
was
a
rattling
of
weapons
and
there
sounded
the
tramp
of
armed
men
and
the
tumult
of
battle
suddenly
the
shape
of
a
man
in
armour
appeared
before
him
terrific
and
menacing
do
you
seek
here
in
a
field
that
has
been
accursed
through
many
centuries
he
asked
you
not
know
that
this
is
a
place
of
terror
and
death
are
you
a
stranger
that
you
stand
on
the
place
where
a
king
louis
the
pious
betrayed
by
his
own
sons
was
handed
over
to
his
enemies
his
crown
torn
from
his
head
by
his
own
troops
and
he
who
would
have
died
gladly
in
battle
suffered
the
shame
and
dishonour
that
were
worse
than
death
he
lifted
up
his
hands
to
heaven
and
cried
with
bitterness
is
no
such
thing
on
earth
as
faith
and
loyalty
accursed
be
sons
and
warriors
accursed
be
this
field
whereon
such
deeds
have
been
done
accursed
be
they
for
ever
the
spectre
paused
and
his
words
echoed
across
the
field
like
the
cry
of
a
lost
soul
again
he
spoke
to
the
trembling
wanderer
that
curse
has
endured
through
the
centuries
under
this
plain
in
graves
we
faithless
warriors
lie
our
bones
knowing
no
repose
and
never
will
that
curse
of
our
betrayed
king
be
lifted
from
us
or
this
place
the
spectral
warrior
sank
into
the
gloomy
earth
the
tumult
of
fighting
died
away
the
wayfarer
seized
with
terror
stumbled
blindly
on
in
the
night
strassburg
strassburg
the
capital
of
is
only
two
miles
west
of
the
rhine
the
city
is
of
considerable
antiquity
and
boasts
a
cathedral
of
great
beauty
in
which
the
work
of
four
centuries
is
displayed
to
wonderful
advantage
by
the
light
of
the
windows
the
famous
astronomical
clock
in
the
south
transept
can
be
descried
still
containing
some
fragments
of
the
horologe
constructed
by
the
mathematician
conrad
dasypodius
in
this
however
does
not
tally
with
the
legend
of
the
clock
which
now
follows
the
clockmaker
of
strassburg
there
dwelt
in
the
town
of
strassburg
an
old
clockmaker
so
wrapped
up
was
he
in
his
art
that
he
seemed
to
live
in
a
world
of
his
own
quite
indifferent
to
the
customs
and
practices
of
ordinary
life
he
forgot
his
meals
forgot
his
sleep
cared
nothing
for
his
clothes
and
would
have
been
in
evil
case
indeed
had
not
his
daughter
guta
tended
him
with
filial
affection
in
his
fashion
he
was
really
very
fond
of
guta
fonder
even
than
he
was
of
his
clocks
and
that
is
saying
not
a
little
the
neighbours
busy
energetic
folk
who
performed
their
daily
tasks
and
drank
wine
with
their
friends
scoffed
at
the
dreamy
unpractical
old
fellow
and
derided
his
occupation
as
the
idle
pastime
of
a
mind
not
too
well
balanced
but
the
clockmaker
finding
in
his
workroom
all
that
he
needed
of
excitement
of
joy
and
sorrow
of
elation
and
despondency
did
not
miss
the
pleasures
of
social
life
nor
did
he
heed
the
idle
gossip
of
which
he
was
the
subject
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
such
a
man
had
but
few
acquaintances
yet
a
few
he
had
and
among
them
one
who
is
worthy
of
especial
wealthy
citizen
who
aspired
to
a
position
of
civic
honour
in
strassburg
in
appearance
he
was
lean
old
and
ugly
with
face
and
cunning
malevolent
eyes
and
when
he
pressed
his
hateful
attentions
on
the
fair
guta
she
turned
from
him
in
disgust
one
day
this
creature
called
on
the
clockmaker
announced
that
he
had
been
made
a
magistrate
and
demanded
the
hand
of
guta
hinting
that
it
would
go
ill
with
the
master
should
he
refuse
the
clockmaker
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
but
he
offered
his
congratulations
and
called
the
girl
to
speak
for
herself
as
to
her
hand
when
guta
heard
the
proposal
she
cast
indignant
glances
at
the
ancient
magistrate
whereupon
he
without
giving
her
an
opportunity
to
speak
said
quickly
not
answer
me
now
sweet
maid
do
not
decide
hastily
i
beg
of
you
for
such
a
course
might
bring
lasting
trouble
on
you
and
your
father
i
will
return
for
your
when
he
was
gone
guta
flung
herself
into
her
arms
and
declared
that
she
could
never
marry
the
aged
swain
dear
said
the
clockmaker
soothingly
shall
do
as
you
please
heed
not
his
threats
for
when
i
have
finished
my
great
work
we
shall
be
as
rich
and
powerful
as
on
the
following
day
the
magistrate
called
again
looking
very
important
and
and
never
doubting
but
that
the
answer
would
be
favourable
but
when
guta
told
him
plainly
that
she
would
not
marry
him
his
rage
was
unbounded
and
he
left
the
house
vowing
vengeance
on
father
and
daughter
scarcely
was
he
gone
ere
a
handsome
youth
entered
the
room
and
looked
with
some
surprise
at
the
disturbed
appearance
of
guta
and
her
father
when
he
heard
the
story
he
was
most
indignant
later
when
the
clockmaker
had
left
the
young
people
alone
guta
confessed
that
the
attentions
of
the
magistrate
were
loathsome
to
her
and
burst
into
tears
the
young
man
had
long
loved
the
maiden
in
secret
and
he
could
conceal
his
passion
no
longer
he
begged
that
she
would
become
his
bride
and
guta
willingly
consented
but
suggested
that
they
should
not
mention
the
matter
to
her
father
till
the
latter
had
completed
his
great
clock
which
he
fondly
believed
was
soon
to
bring
him
fame
and
fortune
she
also
proposed
that
her
lover
should
offer
to
become
her
he
too
was
a
that
in
the
event
of
the
great
work
proving
a
failure
his
business
should
still
be
secure
the
young
man
at
once
acted
upon
the
suggestion
and
the
father
gratefully
received
the
proffered
assistance
at
last
the
day
came
when
the
clockmaker
joyfully
announced
that
his
masterpiece
was
finished
and
he
called
upon
guta
and
his
young
partner
to
witness
his
handiwork
they
beheld
a
wonderful
clock
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
so
constructed
that
the
striking
of
the
hour
automatically
set
in
motion
several
small
figures
the
young
people
were
not
slow
to
express
their
admiration
and
their
confidence
that
fame
was
assured
when
the
clock
was
publicly
exhibited
the
scepticism
of
the
citizens
was
changed
to
respect
praise
and
flattery
flowed
from
the
lips
that
had
formerly
reviled
its
inventor
nevertheless
the
civic
authorities
urged
thereto
by
discarded
lover
refused
to
countenance
any
attempt
to
procure
the
wonderful
clock
for
the
town
but
soon
its
fame
spread
abroad
to
other
cities
members
of
the
guild
of
basel
travelled
to
see
it
and
raised
their
hands
in
surprise
and
admiration
finally
the
municipal
authorities
of
basel
made
arrangements
to
purchase
it
but
at
this
point
the
citizens
of
strassburg
stepped
in
and
insisted
on
preserving
the
clock
in
their
own
city
and
it
was
therefore
purchased
for
a
round
sum
and
erected
in
a
chapel
of
the
strassburg
cathedral
the
corporation
of
basel
having
set
their
hearts
on
the
wonderful
timepiece
commissioned
the
clockmaker
to
make
another
like
it
and
offered
substantial
remuneration
the
old
man
gladly
agreed
but
his
hearing
of
the
arrangement
and
scenting
a
fine
opportunity
for
revenge
contrived
to
raise
an
outcry
against
the
proposal
was
the
advantage
asked
the
magistrates
possessing
a
wonderful
clock
if
every
city
in
germany
was
to
have
one
so
to
preserve
the
uniqueness
of
their
treasure
they
haled
the
old
clockmaker
before
a
tribunal
and
ordered
him
to
cease
practising
his
art
this
he
indignantly
refused
to
do
and
the
council
still
instigated
by
his
enemy
finally
decided
that
his
eyes
be
put
out
so
that
his
skill
in
clockmaking
should
come
to
a
decided
end
not
a
few
objections
were
raised
to
so
cruel
a
decision
but
these
were
at
length
overruled
the
victim
heard
the
dreadful
sentence
without
a
tremor
and
when
asked
if
he
had
any
boon
to
crave
ere
it
were
carried
out
he
answered
quietly
that
he
would
like
to
make
a
few
final
improvements
in
his
clock
and
wished
to
suffer
his
punishment
in
its
presence
accordingly
when
the
day
came
the
old
man
was
conducted
to
the
place
where
his
masterpiece
stood
there
under
pretence
of
making
the
promised
improvements
he
damaged
the
works
after
which
he
submitted
himself
to
his
torturers
hardly
had
they
carried
out
their
cruel
task
when
to
the
consternation
of
the
onlookers
the
clock
began
to
emit
discordant
sounds
and
to
whirr
loudly
when
it
had
continued
thus
for
a
while
the
gong
struck
thirteen
and
the
mechanism
came
to
a
standstill
my
handiwork
cried
the
blind
clockmaker
my
revenge
his
assistant
approached
and
led
him
gently
away
henceforward
he
lived
happily
with
guta
and
her
husband
whose
affectionate
care
compensated
in
part
for
the
loss
of
his
eyesight
and
his
enforced
inability
to
practise
his
beloved
art
when
the
story
became
known
the
base
magistrate
was
deprived
of
his
wealth
and
his
office
and
forced
to
quit
the
town
and
as
for
the
clock
it
remained
in
its
disordered
state
till
when
it
was
once
more
restored
to
its
original
condition
the
trumpeter
of
säckingen
a
beautiful
and
romantic
tale
which
has
inspired
more
than
one
work
of
art
is
the
legend
of
the
trumpeter
of
säckingen
it
shares
with
and
a
few
other
legends
the
distinction
of
being
the
most
widely
popular
in
rhenish
folklore
one
evening
in
early
spring
so
the
legend
runs
a
gallant
young
soldier
emerged
from
the
black
forest
opposite
säckingen
and
reined
in
his
steed
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
night
was
at
hand
and
the
snow
lay
thickly
on
the
ground
for
a
few
moments
the
wayfarer
pondered
whither
he
should
turn
for
food
and
shelter
for
his
steed
and
the
trumpet
he
carried
under
his
cavalry
cloak
were
all
he
possessed
in
the
world
then
with
a
reckless
gesture
he
seized
the
trumpet
and
sounded
some
lively
notes
which
echoed
merrily
over
the
snow
the
parish
priest
toiling
painfully
up
the
hill
heard
the
martial
sound
and
soon
encountered
the
soldier
who
saluted
him
gravely
the
priest
paused
to
return
the
greeting
and
entering
into
conversation
with
the
horseman
he
learned
that
he
was
a
soldier
of
fortune
whereupon
he
invited
him
with
simple
cordiality
to
become
his
guest
the
proffer
of
hospitality
was
gratefully
accepted
and
the
kindly
old
man
led
the
stranger
to
his
home
the
old
priest
though
not
a
little
curious
with
regard
to
his
previous
history
forbore
out
of
courtesy
to
question
him
but
the
warmth
and
cheer
soon
loosened
the
tongue
and
he
volunteered
to
tell
the
old
man
his
story
shorn
of
detail
it
ran
as
follows
the
youth
had
been
passed
at
the
university
of
heidelberg
where
he
had
lived
a
gay
and
careless
life
paying
so
little
attention
to
his
studies
that
at
the
end
of
his
course
his
only
asset
was
a
knowledge
of
music
picked
up
from
a
drunken
trumpeter
in
exchange
for
the
wherewithal
to
satisfy
his
thirst
the
legal
profession
which
his
guardian
had
designed
for
him
was
clearly
impossible
with
such
meagre
acquirements
so
he
had
joined
a
cavalry
regiment
and
fought
in
the
thirty
war
at
the
end
of
the
war
his
horse
and
his
trumpet
were
his
sole
possessions
and
from
that
time
he
had
wandered
through
the
world
gaining
a
scanty
livelihood
with
the
aid
of
his
music
such
was
his
history
that
night
so
the
young
man
was
soundly
in
the
house
of
the
old
priest
and
next
morning
he
rose
early
to
attend
the
festival
of
fridolin
in
celebration
of
which
a
procession
was
organized
every
year
at
säckingen
there
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
girls
he
beheld
a
maid
who
outshone
them
all
in
beauty
and
grace
and
to
her
he
immediately
lost
his
heart
from
that
moment
the
gaieties
of
the
festival
had
no
attraction
for
him
and
he
wandered
disconsolately
among
the
thinking
only
of
the
lovely
face
that
had
caught
his
fancy
toward
nightfall
he
embarked
in
a
little
boat
and
floated
idly
down
the
rhine
suddenly
to
his
amazement
there
arose
from
the
water
the
handsome
youthful
figure
of
the
who
had
recognized
in
his
pale
cheek
and
haggard
eye
the
infallible
signs
of
a
lover
indicating
a
castle
at
the
edge
of
the
river
the
apparition
informed
werner
that
his
dwelt
therein
and
he
bade
him
take
heart
and
seek
some
mode
of
communicating
with
her
at
this
werner
plucked
up
courage
to
row
ashore
to
his
abode
there
in
the
garden
beneath
a
lighted
window
he
played
an
exquisite
serenade
every
perfect
note
of
which
told
of
his
love
and
grief
and
the
wild
hopes
he
would
never
dare
to
express
in
words
now
the
lord
of
the
castle
was
at
that
very
moment
telling
to
his
beautiful
daughter
the
story
of
his
own
wooing
he
paused
in
his
tale
and
bade
his
daughter
listen
to
the
melting
strains
when
the
notes
had
died
away
an
attendant
was
dispatched
to
learn
who
the
musician
might
be
but
ere
he
reached
the
garden
werner
had
and
was
lost
to
sight
on
the
river
however
on
the
following
day
the
nobleman
pursued
his
inquiries
in
the
village
and
the
musician
was
discovered
in
an
inn
in
obedience
to
a
summons
the
trumpeter
hastened
to
the
castle
where
the
old
lord
greeted
him
very
kindly
giving
him
a
place
with
his
musicians
and
appointing
him
to
the
fair
margaretha
henceforward
his
path
lay
in
pleasant
places
for
the
young
people
were
thrown
a
great
deal
into
each
society
and
in
time
it
became
evident
that
the
lady
returned
the
young
tender
passion
yet
werner
did
not
dare
to
declare
his
love
for
margaretha
was
a
maiden
of
high
degree
and
he
but
a
poor
musician
who
not
so
very
long
ago
had
been
a
homeless
wanderer
one
day
werner
heard
strange
discordant
sounds
issuing
from
the
and
thinking
that
some
mischievous
page
was
taking
liberties
with
his
trumpet
he
quietly
made
his
way
to
the
spot
to
find
that
the
inharmonious
sounds
resulted
from
the
vain
attempt
of
his
fair
pupil
to
play
the
instrument
when
the
girl
observed
that
her
endeavours
had
been
overheard
she
joined
her
merriment
with
that
of
her
teacher
and
werner
then
and
there
taught
her
a
a
few
weeks
later
the
nobleman
hearing
of
a
rising
of
the
peasants
hastened
to
säckingen
to
restore
order
leaving
his
daughter
and
werner
to
guard
the
castle
that
night
an
attempt
was
made
upon
the
stronghold
werner
courageously
kept
the
foe
at
bay
but
was
wounded
in
the
mêlée
and
margaretha
seeing
her
lover
fall
and
being
unable
to
reach
him
took
the
trumpet
and
sounded
the
he
had
taught
her
hoping
that
her
father
would
hear
it
and
hasten
his
return
and
sure
enough
that
was
what
happened
the
nobleman
returned
with
all
speed
to
the
assistance
of
the
little
garrison
and
the
remnant
of
the
assailants
were
routed
werner
who
was
happily
not
wounded
seriously
now
received
every
attention
her
peril
had
taught
margaretha
beyond
a
doubt
where
her
affections
lay
and
she
showed
such
unfeigned
delight
at
his
recovery
that
he
forgot
the
difference
in
their
rank
and
told
her
of
his
love
there
on
the
terrace
they
plighted
their
troth
and
vowed
to
remain
true
to
each
other
whatever
might
befall
werner
now
ventured
to
seek
the
nobleman
that
he
might
acquaint
him
of
the
circumstances
and
beg
for
his
hand
but
ere
he
could
prefer
his
request
the
old
man
proceeded
to
tell
him
that
he
had
but
just
received
a
letter
from
an
old
friend
desiring
that
his
son
should
marry
margaretha
as
the
young
man
was
of
noble
birth
he
added
and
eligible
in
every
respect
he
was
disposed
to
agree
to
the
arrangement
and
he
desired
werner
to
write
to
him
and
invite
him
to
säckingen
the
unfortunate
soldier
now
made
his
belated
announcement
but
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
declared
that
only
a
nobleman
should
wed
with
his
daughter
it
is
true
he
was
greatly
attached
to
the
young
musician
but
his
ideas
were
those
of
his
times
and
so
werner
was
obliged
to
quit
his
service
and
fare
once
more
into
the
wide
world
years
passed
by
and
margaretha
who
had
resolutely
discouraged
the
advances
of
her
lover
grew
so
pale
and
woebegone
that
her
father
in
despair
sent
her
to
italy
when
in
rome
she
went
one
sunday
with
her
maid
to
church
and
there
leading
the
papal
choir
was
her
lover
margaretha
promptly
fainted
and
werner
who
had
recognized
his
beloved
was
only
able
with
difficulty
to
perform
the
remainder
of
his
choral
duties
meanwhile
the
pope
had
observed
that
the
young
man
was
deeply
affected
and
believing
this
to
be
caused
by
the
indisposition
he
desired
that
the
couple
should
be
brought
before
him
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
with
kindly
questioning
he
elicited
the
whole
story
and
was
so
touched
by
the
romance
that
he
immediately
created
werner
marquis
of
santo
campo
and
arranged
that
the
marriage
of
the
young
people
should
take
place
at
once
immediately
after
the
ceremony
having
received
the
papal
blessing
they
returned
to
säckingen
where
the
father
of
the
bride
greeted
them
cordially
for
margaretha
was
restored
to
health
and
happiness
and
his
own
condition
was
satisfied
for
had
she
not
brought
home
a
noble
husband
the
in
the
woods
of
zähringen
there
dwelt
a
young
his
parents
before
him
had
followed
the
same
humble
calling
and
one
might
have
supposed
that
the
youth
would
be
well
satisfied
to
emulate
their
simple
industry
and
contentment
but
in
truth
it
was
not
so
on
one
occasion
while
on
an
errand
to
the
town
he
had
witnessed
a
tournament
and
the
brilliant
spectacle
of
beauty
and
chivalry
had
lingered
in
his
memory
and
fired
his
boyish
enthusiasm
so
that
thenceforth
he
was
possessed
by
the
romance
of
the
ancient
forests
wherein
he
dwelt
fostered
his
strange
longings
and
in
fancy
he
already
saw
himself
a
knight
fighting
in
the
wars
jousting
in
the
lists
receiving
perchance
the
prize
of
the
tourney
from
the
fair
hands
of
its
queen
and
indeed
in
all
save
birth
and
station
he
was
well
fitted
for
the
profession
of
brave
spirited
and
withal
gentle
and
courteous
time
passed
and
his
ambitions
seemed
as
far
as
ever
from
realization
yet
the
ambitious
mind
lacks
not
fuel
for
its
fires
the
imagination
peopled
the
woody
solitudes
with
braver
company
than
courts
could
unreal
whose
shadowy
presence
increased
his
longing
for
the
actuality
the
very
winds
whispered
mysteriously
of
coming
triumphs
and
as
he
listened
his
unrest
grew
greater
at
length
there
came
a
time
when
dreams
no
longer
satisfied
him
and
he
pondered
how
he
might
attain
his
desires
will
go
out
into
the
world
he
said
to
himself
take
service
under
some
great
knight
then
at
this
point
his
musings
were
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
an
old
man
clad
in
the
garb
of
a
hermit
son
he
said
aileth
thee
the
youth
looked
up
in
answer
me
not
for
i
know
what
thou
wouldst
have
yet
must
thou
not
forsake
thy
lowly
occupation
that
which
thou
dost
seek
will
only
come
to
thee
whilst
thou
art
engaged
thereon
follow
me
and
i
will
show
thee
the
spot
where
thy
destiny
will
meet
the
young
man
not
yet
recovered
from
his
surprise
followed
his
aged
guide
to
a
distant
part
of
the
forest
then
the
hermit
bade
him
farewell
and
left
him
to
ponder
on
the
cryptic
saying
thy
destiny
will
meet
will
show
the
old
meaning
i
suppose
he
said
to
himself
any
case
i
may
as
well
burn
charcoal
here
as
he
set
to
work
hewed
down
some
great
trees
and
built
a
kiln
which
before
lighting
he
covered
with
stony
earth
what
was
his
amazement
when
on
removing
the
cover
of
the
kiln
in
due
course
he
discovered
within
some
pieces
of
pure
gold
a
reflection
convinced
him
that
the
precious
metal
must
have
been
melted
out
of
the
stones
so
he
again
built
a
kiln
and
experienced
the
same
gratifying
result
delighted
with
his
good
fortune
he
concealed
his
treasure
in
an
appropriate
and
proceeded
to
repeat
the
process
till
he
had
obtained
and
hidden
a
large
fortune
of
whose
existence
none
but
himself
was
aware
one
night
as
he
lay
awake
listening
to
the
wind
in
the
his
great
wealth
had
this
drawback
that
it
robbed
him
of
his
fancied
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
at
first
he
thought
he
must
have
been
mistaken
but
as
he
hesitated
whether
to
rise
or
not
the
knock
was
repeated
boldly
he
undid
the
feat
requiring
no
small
courage
in
that
remote
part
of
the
forest
where
robbers
and
freebooters
there
without
stood
a
poor
wayfarer
who
humbly
begged
admittance
he
was
being
pursued
he
declared
would
the
shelter
him
for
a
few
days
touched
by
the
plight
and
moved
by
feelings
worthy
of
his
chivalrous
ideals
the
youth
readily
extended
the
hospitality
of
his
poor
home
and
for
some
time
the
stranger
sojourned
there
in
peace
he
did
not
offer
to
reveal
his
identity
nor
was
he
questioned
on
that
point
but
one
morning
he
declared
his
intention
of
taking
his
departure
friend
he
said
warmly
know
not
how
i
may
thank
you
for
your
brave
loyalty
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
know
whom
you
have
served
so
faithfully
behold
your
unfortunate
emperor
overcome
in
battle
deprived
of
friends
and
followers
and
fortune
at
these
astounding
words
the
young
sank
on
his
knees
before
the
emperor
he
said
have
yet
one
humble
subject
who
will
never
forsake
you
while
life
remains
to
know
replied
the
emperor
gently
raising
him
to
his
feet
therefore
i
ask
of
you
one
last
service
it
is
that
you
may
lead
me
by
some
secret
path
to
the
place
where
the
remnant
of
my
followers
await
me
alas
that
i
once
so
powerful
should
be
unable
to
offer
you
any
token
of
a
gratitude
ventured
the
youth
i
may
be
privileged
to
render
yet
one
more
service
to
your
straightway
he
told
the
story
of
his
hidden
treasure
and
with
simple
dignity
placed
it
at
the
disposal
of
his
sovereign
asking
for
nothing
in
return
but
the
right
to
spend
his
strength
in
the
right
which
was
readily
accorded
him
the
gold
now
withdrawn
from
its
place
of
concealment
proved
to
be
a
goodly
store
and
with
it
the
emperor
had
no
difficulty
in
raising
another
army
such
was
the
courage
and
confidence
of
his
new
troops
that
the
first
battle
they
fought
resulted
in
victory
but
the
most
valiant
stand
was
made
by
the
erstwhile
who
found
on
that
field
the
opportunity
of
which
he
had
long
dreamt
the
emperor
showed
his
recognition
of
the
gallant
services
by
knighting
the
young
man
on
the
field
of
battle
on
the
eminence
whither
the
old
hermit
had
led
him
the
knight
built
a
castle
which
was
occupied
by
himself
and
his
successors
for
many
generations
and
thus
did
the
become
the
knight
of
zähringen
the
friend
of
his
emperor
the
first
of
a
long
line
of
illustrious
knights
honoured
and
exalted
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
conclusion
with
this
legend
we
close
on
a
brighter
and
more
hopeful
note
than
is
usually
associated
with
legends
of
the
rhine
the
reader
may
have
observed
in
perusing
these
romances
how
closely
they
mirror
their
several
environments
for
the
most
part
those
which
are
gay
and
buoyant
in
spirit
have
for
the
places
of
their
birth
slopes
where
is
prisoned
the
sunshine
which
later
sparkles
in
the
and
inspires
song
and
cheerfulness
those
again
which
are
sombre
and
tragic
have
as
background
the
gloomy
forest
the
dark
and
windy
promontory
which
overhangs
the
darker
river
or
the
secluded
nunnery
in
such
surroundings
is
fostered
the
germ
of
tragedy
that
feeling
of
the
inevitable
which
is
inherent
in
all
great
literature
it
is
to
a
tragic
imagination
of
a
lofty
type
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
greatest
of
these
legends
and
he
who
can
not
appreciate
their
background
of
gloomy
grandeur
will
never
come
at
the
true
spirit
of
that
mighty
literature
of
germany
at
once
the
joy
and
the
despair
of
all
who
know
it
countless
songs
warlike
and
tender
sad
and
passionate
have
been
penned
on
the
river
whose
deathless
tales
we
have
been
privileged
to
display
to
the
reader
but
no
such
strains
of
regret
upon
abandoning
its
shores
have
been
sung
as
those
which
passed
the
lips
of
the
english
poet
byron
and
it
is
fitting
that
this
book
should
end
with
lines
so
appropriate
adieu
to
thee
fair
rhine
how
long
delighted
the
stranger
fain
would
linger
on
his
way
thine
is
a
scene
alike
where
souls
united
or
lonely
contemplation
thus
might
stray
and
could
the
ceaseless
vultures
cease
to
prey
on
bosoms
it
were
here
where
nature
nor
too
sombre
nor
too
gay
wild
but
not
rude
awful
yet
not
austere
is
to
the
mellow
earth
as
autumn
to
the
year
adieu
to
thee
again
a
vain
adieu
there
can
be
no
farewell
to
scene
like
thine
the
mind
is
by
thy
every
hue
and
if
reluctantly
the
eyes
resign
their
gaze
upon
thee
lovely
rhine
with
the
thankful
heart
of
parting
praise
more
mighty
spots
may
rise
more
glaring
shine
but
none
unite
in
one
attaching
maze
the
brilliant
fair
and
soft
glories
of
old
days
the
negligently
grand
the
fruitful
bloom
of
coming
ripeness
the
white
sheen
the
rolling
stream
the
gloom
the
growth
and
gothic
walls
between
the
wild
rocks
shaped
as
they
had
turrets
been
in
mockery
of
art
and
there
withal
a
race
of
faces
happy
as
the
scene
whose
fertile
bounties
here
extend
to
all
still
springing
thy
banks
though
empires
near
them
fall
