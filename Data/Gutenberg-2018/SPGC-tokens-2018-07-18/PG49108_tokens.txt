chapter
i
true
to
her
word
madame
bergeret
quitted
the
conjugal
roof
and
betook
herself
to
the
house
of
her
mother
the
widow
pouilly
as
the
time
for
her
departure
drew
near
she
had
half
a
mind
not
to
go
and
with
a
little
coaxing
would
have
consented
to
forget
the
past
and
resume
the
old
life
with
her
husband
at
the
same
time
vaguely
despising
bergeret
as
the
injured
party
she
was
quite
ready
to
forgive
and
forget
but
the
unbending
esteem
in
which
she
was
held
by
the
circle
in
which
she
moved
did
not
allow
of
such
a
course
madame
dellion
had
made
it
clear
to
her
that
any
such
weakness
on
her
part
would
be
judged
unfavourably
all
the
in
the
place
were
unanimous
upon
that
score
there
was
but
one
opinion
among
the
tradespeople
madame
bergeret
return
to
her
mother
in
this
way
did
they
uphold
the
proprieties
and
at
the
same
time
rid
themselves
of
a
thoughtless
common
compromising
person
whose
vulgarity
was
apparent
even
to
the
vulgar
and
who
was
a
burden
on
everybody
about
her
they
made
her
believe
there
was
something
heroic
in
her
conduct
i
have
the
greatest
admiration
for
you
my
child
said
old
madame
dutilleul
from
the
depths
of
her
easy
chair
she
who
had
survived
four
husbands
and
was
a
truly
terrible
woman
people
suspected
her
of
everything
except
of
ever
having
loved
and
in
her
old
age
she
was
honoured
and
respected
by
all
madame
bergeret
was
delighted
at
having
inspired
sympathy
in
madame
dellion
and
admiration
in
madame
dutilleul
and
still
she
could
not
finally
make
up
her
mind
to
go
for
she
was
of
a
homely
disposition
and
accustomed
to
regular
habits
and
quite
content
to
live
on
in
idleness
and
deceit
having
grasped
this
fact
bergeret
redoubled
his
efforts
to
ensure
his
deliverance
he
stoutly
upheld
marie
the
servant
who
kept
every
one
in
the
house
in
a
state
of
wretchedness
and
trepidation
was
suspected
of
harbouring
thieves
and
in
her
kitchen
and
only
brought
herself
into
prominence
by
the
catastrophes
she
caused
four
days
before
the
time
appointed
for
madame
bergeret
s
departure
this
girl
who
was
drunk
as
usual
upset
a
lighted
lamp
in
her
mistress
s
room
and
set
fire
to
the
blue
chintz
madame
bergeret
was
spending
the
day
with
her
friend
madame
lacarelle
she
returned
and
amid
the
dreadful
stillness
of
the
house
beheld
on
entering
her
room
the
evidences
of
the
disaster
she
called
and
called
in
vain
for
her
husband
and
her
besotted
maid
then
stood
gazing
at
the
ceiling
and
the
dismal
ravages
of
the
fire
this
commonplace
accident
assumed
in
her
eyes
a
mystic
significance
that
frightened
her
but
presently
as
the
candle
began
to
flicker
she
lay
down
tired
out
and
very
cold
upon
her
bed
under
the
skeleton
of
the
charred
canopy
whose
black
shreds
fluttered
like
the
wings
of
a
bat
the
next
morning
on
waking
she
wept
for
her
blue
curtains
the
souvenir
and
symbol
of
her
youth
with
dishevelled
hair
smothered
with
blacks
and
clad
only
in
her
nightdress
she
ran
desperately
about
the
rooms
crying
and
moaning
bergeret
took
no
notice
of
her
for
him
she
had
ceased
to
exist
that
evening
with
the
help
of
the
girl
marie
she
drew
her
bed
into
the
middle
of
the
dreary
room
but
now
she
realized
that
this
room
could
never
again
be
a
for
her
and
that
she
must
leave
the
home
where
for
fifteen
years
she
had
fulfilled
the
duties
of
daily
life
moreover
the
ingenious
bergeret
having
taken
rooms
for
his
daughter
pauline
and
himself
in
a
little
house
in
the
place
was
busy
moving
out
and
moving
in
he
went
backwards
and
forwards
ceaselessly
between
the
two
houses
keeping
close
to
the
walls
and
trotting
along
with
the
agility
of
a
mouse
suddenly
unearthed
in
a
heap
of
debris
his
heart
was
glad
within
him
but
he
concealed
his
joy
for
he
was
a
prudent
man
having
been
told
that
at
an
early
date
she
must
hand
over
the
keys
of
the
house
to
the
landlord
madame
bergeret
in
like
manner
set
about
despatching
her
furniture
to
her
mother
who
lived
in
a
maisonnette
on
the
ramparts
of
a
little
northern
town
she
made
bundles
of
clothes
and
of
linen
pushed
the
furniture
about
gave
orders
to
the
men
sneezed
in
the
dusty
atmosphere
and
wrote
out
labels
addressed
to
madame
veuve
from
her
labours
madame
bergeret
derived
moral
assistance
for
it
is
good
for
mankind
to
work
it
takes
a
man
s
mind
off
his
own
life
and
turns
him
away
from
dreadful
it
keeps
him
from
that
which
makes
solitude
unbearable
the
contemplation
of
that
other
being
his
real
self
it
is
the
sovereign
remedy
for
moral
and
æsthetic
obsessions
work
is
also
excellent
in
that
it
panders
to
our
vanity
hides
from
us
our
impotence
and
flatters
us
with
the
hope
of
something
good
to
come
we
imagine
that
it
enables
us
to
steal
a
march
on
fate
failing
to
realize
the
necessary
relation
between
individual
endeavour
and
the
mechanism
of
the
universe
we
fondly
imagine
that
our
efforts
are
directed
to
our
own
advantage
against
the
rest
of
the
machine
work
gives
us
illusory
determination
strength
and
independence
and
makes
us
as
gods
in
our
own
eyes
we
appear
to
ourselves
as
so
many
heroes
genii
demons
demiurges
gods
yes
as
god
himself
and
in
fact
man
has
always
conceived
of
god
as
a
worker
thus
it
was
that
the
removal
restored
madame
bergeret
s
natural
gaiety
and
the
joyous
energy
of
her
physical
strength
she
sang
songs
as
she
tied
up
parcels
the
rapid
flow
of
blood
in
her
veins
made
her
content
and
she
looked
forward
to
a
happy
future
she
painted
in
glowing
colours
her
life
in
the
little
flemish
town
where
she
would
live
with
her
mother
and
her
two
younger
daughters
there
she
hoped
to
grow
young
again
to
be
brilliant
and
admired
to
have
attention
offered
her
and
to
find
sympathy
who
could
say
whether
once
the
decree
was
granted
in
her
favour
a
second
and
wealthy
marriage
were
not
awaiting
her
in
her
native
town
was
it
not
quite
possible
that
she
might
marry
a
sensible
man
a
country
gentleman
an
agriculturist
or
a
government
official
somebody
quite
different
from
bergeret
the
also
afforded
her
peculiar
satisfaction
for
from
it
she
derived
some
solid
advantages
in
the
way
of
gain
not
satisfied
with
the
appropriation
of
what
she
had
brought
as
her
marriage
portion
and
a
large
share
of
the
common
property
she
heaped
into
her
trunks
things
which
she
ought
in
ordinary
fairness
to
have
left
to
others
in
this
way
she
packed
among
her
underclothes
a
silver
cup
which
had
belonged
to
bergeret
s
maternal
grandmother
again
she
added
to
her
own
jewels
which
be
it
said
were
of
no
great
value
the
watch
and
chain
of
bergeret
s
father
a
professor
at
the
university
who
having
refused
in
to
swear
fidelity
to
the
empire
had
died
in
poor
and
forgotten
madame
bergeret
interrupted
her
packing
only
to
go
and
pay
her
farewell
calls
visits
both
sad
and
triumphant
public
opinion
was
in
her
favour
men
s
judgments
are
diverse
and
there
is
no
place
in
the
world
where
there
is
undivided
and
unanimous
opinion
on
any
single
subject
mundum
disputationibus
madame
bergeret
herself
was
the
subject
of
polite
discussion
and
of
secret
dissent
the
greater
number
of
the
ladies
of
her
acquaintance
considered
her
irreproachable
otherwise
they
would
not
have
received
her
at
their
houses
there
were
a
few
however
who
suspected
that
her
adventure
with
roux
had
not
been
quite
blameless
some
of
them
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
so
one
blamed
her
another
excused
her
a
third
approved
of
her
casting
all
the
blame
upon
bergeret
as
being
a
spiteful
man
that
point
too
was
open
to
doubt
some
people
declared
bergeret
to
be
a
nice
quiet
man
the
only
thing
to
dislike
in
him
being
his
too
subtle
mind
which
was
at
variance
with
public
opinion
de
terremondre
said
that
bergeret
was
a
very
nice
sort
of
man
to
which
madame
dellion
replied
that
if
he
were
really
a
good
man
he
would
have
stood
by
his
wife
however
wicked
she
was
there
would
be
some
merit
in
that
she
said
there
is
nothing
noble
in
with
a
charming
another
opinion
of
madame
dellion
s
was
m
bergeret
is
doing
his
utmost
to
keep
his
wife
but
she
is
leaving
him
and
quite
right
too
it
serves
bergeret
thus
did
madame
dellion
express
opinions
which
were
inconsistent
for
human
thought
has
ever
depended
not
upon
force
of
reason
but
on
violence
of
feeling
although
the
world
is
known
to
be
uncertain
in
its
judgment
madame
bergeret
would
have
gone
from
the
town
in
possession
of
a
good
reputation
if
on
the
very
eve
of
her
departure
when
paying
her
farewell
visit
to
madame
lacarelle
she
had
not
met
lacarelle
alone
in
the
gustave
lacarelle
chief
clerk
at
the
had
a
long
thick
fair
moustache
which
while
the
chief
characteristic
of
his
countenance
was
also
destined
to
determine
his
character
in
his
student
days
at
the
law
schools
his
comrades
had
discovered
in
him
a
resemblance
to
the
ancient
gauls
as
depicted
in
the
sculpture
and
paintings
of
the
later
romanticists
other
more
careful
observers
remarking
that
the
long
strands
of
hair
were
situated
under
a
snub
nose
and
placid
eyes
gave
lacarelle
the
name
of
the
the
latter
however
did
not
prevail
against
that
of
the
lacarelle
became
the
gaul
to
his
companions
who
consequently
made
up
their
minds
that
he
ought
to
be
a
great
drinker
a
great
fighter
and
a
devil
with
the
women
in
order
that
he
might
conform
in
reality
to
the
frenchman
of
immemorial
tradition
at
the
corps
dinners
he
was
forced
to
drink
far
more
than
he
wanted
and
he
could
never
go
into
a
with
his
friends
without
being
pushed
up
against
some
waitress
when
he
married
and
returned
to
his
native
town
and
by
what
was
a
great
stroke
of
fortune
in
those
days
obtained
a
post
in
the
central
administration
of
the
department
from
which
he
hailed
gustave
lacarelle
continued
to
be
called
the
gaul
by
the
most
important
of
the
magistrates
lawyers
and
government
officials
who
frequented
his
house
the
ignorant
mob
however
did
not
bestow
this
name
upon
him
until
in
which
year
a
statue
to
eporedorix
was
erected
and
unveiled
on
the
pont
national
years
previously
under
the
presidency
of
thiers
it
had
been
decided
that
subscriptions
should
be
invited
for
the
erection
of
a
statue
to
the
gaulish
chief
eporedorix
who
in
the
year
led
the
river
tribes
against
cæsar
and
imperilled
the
small
roman
garrison
by
cutting
down
the
wooden
bridge
built
by
them
to
ensure
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
army
the
archæologists
of
the
little
county
town
firmly
believed
that
this
feat
of
arms
had
been
accomplished
in
their
town
founding
their
belief
on
a
passage
in
the
which
all
the
learned
societies
of
the
district
quoted
as
a
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
wooden
bridge
cut
down
by
eporedorix
was
situated
in
particular
town
there
is
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
with
regard
to
cæsar
s
geography
and
local
patriotism
is
both
fierce
and
jealous
the
chief
town
of
the
department
three
and
four
smaller
towns
quarrelled
for
the
glory
of
having
slaughtered
the
romans
by
the
hand
of
eporedorix
competent
authority
decided
the
question
in
favour
of
the
capital
town
of
the
department
it
was
an
unfortified
town
which
much
to
its
sorrow
and
anger
had
been
forced
in
after
one
hour
s
bombardment
to
allow
the
enemy
to
enter
its
walls
walls
which
in
the
time
of
louis
xi
had
been
crumbling
to
pieces
and
now
lay
concealed
beneath
the
ivy
that
had
overgrown
them
the
town
had
undergone
the
hardships
and
privations
of
military
occupation
it
had
suffered
and
atoned
the
project
of
erecting
a
monument
to
the
memory
of
the
gaulish
chief
was
received
with
enthusiasm
by
the
townspeople
who
were
experiencing
the
humiliation
of
defeat
and
were
all
the
more
grateful
to
their
compatriot
for
providing
them
with
something
of
which
they
could
be
proud
resuscitated
after
fifteen
hundred
years
of
oblivion
eporedorix
united
all
the
citizens
in
a
bond
of
filial
devotion
the
name
of
the
hero
roused
no
distrust
in
any
of
the
different
political
parties
which
were
then
dividing
france
opportunists
radicals
constitutionalists
royalists
orleanists
bonapartists
they
all
gave
to
the
scheme
half
the
cost
was
subscribed
within
the
year
and
deputies
of
the
department
obtained
from
the
government
what
was
wanting
to
make
up
the
required
sum
the
order
for
the
statue
of
eporedorix
was
given
to
mathieu
michel
david
d
angers
youngest
pupil
he
whom
the
master
had
called
his
benjamin
mathieu
michel
who
was
then
in
his
fiftieth
year
at
once
set
to
work
and
attacked
the
clay
with
a
generous
if
somewhat
cramped
hand
for
the
republican
sculptor
had
done
but
little
work
during
the
empire
in
less
than
two
years
however
he
finished
the
figure
a
plaster
model
of
which
was
exhibited
in
the
salon
of
among
many
other
gaulish
chiefs
gathered
together
among
the
palms
and
begonias
under
the
huge
glass
dome
owing
to
the
endless
formalities
insisted
upon
by
the
authorities
the
statue
was
not
finally
completed
in
marble
for
another
five
years
after
this
so
many
administrative
difficulties
so
many
disputes
arose
between
the
town
and
the
government
that
it
looked
as
though
the
statue
of
eporedorix
would
never
be
erected
upon
the
pont
national
in
however
the
work
was
accomplished
and
the
statue
arriving
from
paris
was
received
by
the
who
solemnly
handed
it
over
to
the
mayor
of
the
town
mathieu
michel
accompanied
his
work
he
was
then
over
seventy
and
the
whole
town
turned
out
to
look
at
the
old
man
with
his
head
and
long
flowing
white
hair
the
inauguration
took
place
on
the
of
june
when
dupont
was
minister
of
public
instruction
of
the
department
and
trumelle
mayor
of
the
town
doubtless
the
enthusiasm
was
not
what
it
would
have
been
on
the
morrow
of
the
invasion
when
indignation
was
at
its
height
but
at
any
rate
everybody
was
satisfied
the
speeches
and
also
the
uniforms
of
the
officers
met
with
applause
and
when
the
green
veil
which
hid
eporedorix
from
view
was
withdrawn
the
whole
town
cried
as
with
one
voice
lacarelle
it
is
lacarelle
it
is
the
image
of
lacarelle
this
to
tell
the
truth
was
by
no
means
correct
mathieu
michel
the
pupil
and
emulator
of
david
d
angers
he
whom
the
venerable
master
called
the
child
of
his
old
age
the
republican
sculptor
and
patriot
insurgent
in
volunteer
in
had
not
portrayed
gustave
lacarelle
in
this
marble
hero
no
indeed
this
chief
with
his
shy
and
gentle
look
clasping
his
lance
and
seeming
under
his
helmet
to
be
meditating
upon
the
poetry
of
chateaubriand
and
the
historic
philosophy
of
henri
martin
this
warrior
steeped
in
romantic
melancholy
was
not
in
spite
of
what
the
people
cried
the
true
portrait
of
lacarelle
the
secretary
had
big
prominent
eyes
a
short
snub
nose
flabby
cheeks
and
a
double
chin
mathieu
michel
s
eporedorix
gazed
with
orbs
into
the
distance
his
nose
was
grecian
and
the
contour
of
his
face
pure
and
classical
but
like
lacarelle
he
had
a
tremendous
moustache
the
long
curving
branches
of
which
were
visible
from
every
point
of
view
struck
by
this
resemblance
the
crowd
unanimously
bestowed
upon
lacarelle
the
glorious
name
of
eporedorix
and
from
that
time
the
secretary
of
the
found
himself
compelled
to
personate
in
public
the
popular
idea
of
the
gaul
and
to
conform
to
it
by
word
and
deed
under
all
circumstances
lacarelle
was
fairly
successful
for
he
had
had
plenty
of
practice
since
his
student
days
and
all
that
was
required
of
him
was
to
be
with
everybody
keen
on
the
army
and
a
teller
of
broad
stories
when
necessary
he
was
considered
to
be
an
adept
at
kissing
women
and
so
he
became
a
great
embracer
he
kissed
them
all
and
he
kissed
them
always
it
did
not
matter
who
they
were
women
young
girls
and
little
girls
pretty
ones
and
plain
old
and
young
he
embraced
them
out
of
pure
gaulishness
and
with
no
evil
intentions
for
he
was
a
moral
man
and
that
is
why
coming
unexpectedly
upon
madame
bergeret
waiting
in
the
for
his
wife
he
immediately
embraced
her
madame
bergeret
was
not
ignorant
of
lacarelle
s
little
habit
but
her
vanity
which
was
great
confounded
her
judgment
which
was
scanty
she
thought
he
kissed
her
because
he
loved
her
and
straightway
fell
into
so
great
an
emotion
that
her
bosom
heaved
stormily
her
legs
gave
way
beneath
her
and
she
sank
panting
into
the
arms
of
lacarelle
the
latter
was
both
surprised
and
embarrassed
but
his
was
flattered
he
placed
madame
bergeret
as
comfortably
as
he
could
upon
the
couch
and
bending
over
her
said
in
a
voice
filled
with
sympathy
poor
lady
so
charming
and
so
unhappy
and
so
you
are
leaving
us
you
are
going
and
he
imprinted
upon
her
brow
a
chaste
kiss
but
madame
bergeret
whose
nerves
were
all
unstrung
burst
into
a
fit
of
sobs
and
tears
then
slowly
solemnly
and
sorrowfully
she
returned
his
kiss
at
the
very
moment
that
madame
lacarelle
entered
the
room
the
next
day
the
whole
town
sat
in
judgment
upon
madame
bergeret
who
had
remained
among
them
just
one
day
too
long
chapter
ii
that
day
the
duc
de
brécé
was
entertaining
general
cartier
de
chalmot
abbé
guitrel
and
lerond
the
at
brécé
they
had
visited
the
stables
the
kennels
the
pheasantry
and
had
been
talking
all
the
time
about
the
affair
as
the
twilight
fell
they
commenced
to
stroll
slowly
along
the
great
avenue
of
the
park
before
them
the
château
rose
up
in
the
dapple
grey
sky
with
its
heavy
façade
laden
with
pediments
and
crowned
with
the
roofs
of
the
empire
period
i
am
convinced
said
de
brécé
as
i
said
before
that
the
fuss
made
over
this
affair
is
and
can
only
be
some
abominable
plot
instigated
by
the
enemies
of
and
of
religion
gently
added
abbé
guitrel
it
is
impossible
to
be
a
good
frenchman
without
being
a
good
christian
and
it
is
clear
that
the
scandal
was
started
in
the
first
place
by
freethinkers
and
freemasons
by
and
jews
went
on
de
brécé
jews
and
germans
what
audacity
to
question
the
decision
of
a
court
martial
for
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
is
quite
impossible
for
seven
french
officers
to
have
made
a
no
of
course
that
is
not
to
be
thought
of
said
the
abbé
guitrel
generally
speaking
put
in
lerond
a
miscarriage
of
justice
is
a
most
improbable
thing
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
an
impossible
thing
inasmuch
as
the
law
protects
the
accused
in
so
many
ways
i
am
speaking
of
civil
law
and
i
say
the
same
of
martial
law
as
far
as
courts
martial
are
concerned
even
supposing
the
prisoner
s
interest
to
be
less
thoroughly
safeguarded
owing
to
the
comparatively
summary
form
of
procedure
he
finds
all
necessary
security
in
the
character
of
his
judges
to
my
mind
it
is
an
insult
to
the
army
to
doubt
the
legality
of
a
verdict
delivered
by
a
court
you
are
quite
correct
replied
the
duke
besides
can
anyone
really
believe
seven
french
officers
to
be
mistaken
is
such
a
thing
conceivable
general
hardly
replied
general
cartier
de
chalmot
it
would
take
a
great
deal
to
make
me
believe
a
syndicate
of
treachery
cried
de
brécé
the
thing
is
unheard
of
conversation
flagged
and
fell
the
duke
and
the
general
had
just
caught
sight
of
some
pheasants
in
a
clearing
and
smitten
simultaneously
with
the
burning
and
instinctive
desire
to
kill
mentally
recorded
a
regret
at
having
no
guns
with
them
you
have
the
finest
coverts
in
the
district
said
the
general
to
the
duc
de
brécé
the
duke
was
deep
in
thought
i
don
t
care
what
anyone
says
he
remarked
the
jews
will
never
be
any
good
to
the
duc
de
brécé
eldest
son
of
the
late
duke
who
had
cut
a
dash
among
the
at
the
assemblée
de
versailles
had
entered
public
life
after
the
death
of
the
comte
de
chambord
he
had
never
known
the
days
of
hope
the
hours
of
ardent
struggle
of
monarchical
enterprises
as
exciting
as
a
conspiracy
and
as
impassioned
as
an
act
of
faith
he
had
never
seen
the
tapestried
bed
offered
to
the
prince
by
noble
ladies
nor
the
banners
the
flags
and
the
white
horses
which
were
to
bring
the
king
to
his
own
again
by
right
of
birth
as
a
brécé
he
took
his
place
as
deputy
at
the
nourishing
a
secret
enmity
against
the
comte
de
paris
and
a
hidden
wish
never
to
see
the
restoration
if
it
were
to
be
in
favour
of
the
younger
branch
of
the
royal
family
with
this
one
exception
he
was
a
loyal
and
faithful
royalist
he
was
drawn
into
intrigues
which
he
did
not
understand
made
a
hopeless
muddle
of
his
votes
spent
his
money
freely
in
paris
and
when
the
elections
took
place
found
himself
defeated
at
brécé
by
cotard
from
that
day
onward
he
devoted
his
time
to
farming
to
his
family
and
to
religion
all
that
remained
of
his
hereditary
domain
which
in
was
composed
of
one
hundred
and
twelve
parishes
comprising
one
hundred
and
seventy
hommages
four
terres
titrés
and
eighteen
manors
was
about
two
thousand
acres
of
land
and
forest
around
the
historic
castle
of
brécé
in
his
department
the
brécé
coverts
invested
him
with
a
lustre
that
he
had
never
enjoyed
at
the
the
forests
of
brécé
and
la
guerche
in
which
francis
i
had
hunted
were
also
celebrated
in
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
the
district
for
in
these
woods
was
situated
the
chapel
of
now
mark
what
i
tell
you
repeated
the
duc
de
brécé
the
jews
will
bring
misfortune
upon
france
why
don
t
we
get
rid
of
them
nothing
would
be
easier
it
would
be
a
great
thing
replied
the
magistrate
but
not
so
easy
as
you
imagine
le
duc
in
the
first
place
if
you
wish
in
any
way
to
affect
the
position
of
the
jews
in
this
country
you
must
make
new
laws
on
naturalization
now
it
is
always
difficult
to
make
a
law
which
will
satisfactorily
fulfil
the
intentions
of
the
legislator
and
laws
such
as
these
would
affect
the
whole
of
our
legal
system
and
would
moreover
be
extremely
difficult
to
draft
then
unfortunately
we
could
never
be
certain
of
finding
a
government
ready
to
propose
or
support
them
nor
a
parliament
to
carry
them
the
senate
is
no
good
as
history
unrolls
itself
before
our
eyes
we
make
the
discovery
that
the
eighteenth
century
is
one
huge
error
of
the
human
understanding
and
that
social
as
well
as
religious
truths
are
to
be
found
in
their
full
completeness
only
in
the
traditions
of
the
middle
ages
by
and
by
france
will
find
it
necessary
as
russia
has
done
with
regard
to
the
jews
to
revert
to
the
procedure
adopted
in
those
feudal
times
which
offer
the
best
example
of
the
typical
christian
naturally
said
the
duke
christian
france
should
belong
to
frenchmen
and
christians
not
to
jews
and
bravo
cried
the
general
there
was
a
younger
son
in
our
family
went
on
the
duke
called
argent
i
don
t
know
why
who
fought
in
the
provinces
during
the
reign
of
charles
ix
on
that
tree
whose
leafless
top
you
see
over
there
he
hanged
six
hundred
and
huguenots
well
i
must
confess
i
am
proud
of
being
a
descendant
of
argent
i
have
inherited
his
hatred
of
heretics
and
i
hate
jews
in
the
same
way
that
he
hated
such
sentiments
are
most
praiseworthy
le
duc
remarked
the
abbé
most
laudable
and
worthy
of
the
great
name
you
bear
but
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
make
a
comment
on
just
one
point
in
the
middle
ages
the
jews
were
not
considered
heretics
and
properly
speaking
they
are
not
heretics
the
heretic
is
a
man
who
having
been
baptized
and
instructed
in
the
doctrines
of
the
faith
misrepresents
or
denies
them
such
are
or
rather
were
the
arians
the
albigenses
the
novatians
the
montanists
the
priscillianists
the
waldenses
the
anabaptists
and
the
calvinists
so
cleverly
disposed
of
by
your
illustrious
ancestor
argent
not
to
mention
many
other
sects
who
upheld
doctrines
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
the
church
the
number
of
them
is
very
great
for
variety
is
a
characteristic
of
error
there
is
no
stopping
on
the
downward
path
of
heresy
and
schism
reproduces
and
multiplies
itself
all
that
one
finds
opposing
the
true
church
is
the
dust
and
ashes
of
churches
the
other
day
when
reading
bossuet
i
came
across
an
admirable
definition
of
a
heretic
a
heretic
says
bossuet
is
one
who
holds
an
opinion
of
his
own
one
who
acts
according
to
his
own
ideas
and
his
own
now
the
jew
who
has
never
received
baptism
nor
been
instructed
in
the
truth
can
not
rightly
be
called
a
heretic
and
again
we
see
that
the
inquisition
never
chastised
a
jew
as
such
and
if
a
jew
was
handed
over
to
earthly
justice
it
was
because
he
was
a
blasphemer
a
profane
person
or
a
corrupter
of
the
faithful
a
better
name
for
the
jew
would
be
infidel
because
that
is
the
name
we
give
to
those
who
being
unbaptized
do
not
believe
in
the
truths
of
the
christian
religion
again
we
must
not
strictly
speaking
look
upon
the
jew
as
an
infidel
in
the
same
way
as
we
should
a
mohammedan
or
an
idolater
the
jews
occupy
a
unique
and
singular
position
in
the
economy
of
the
eternal
verities
theology
bestows
upon
them
a
designation
conformable
to
their
rôle
in
history
they
were
called
witnesses
in
the
middle
ages
and
we
must
admire
the
force
and
precision
of
such
a
term
the
reason
why
god
allows
them
to
live
is
that
they
may
serve
as
witnesses
and
sureties
for
the
words
and
deeds
upon
which
our
religion
is
founded
we
must
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
god
purposely
makes
the
jews
obstinate
and
blind
to
serve
as
living
proofs
of
christianity
but
he
utilizes
their
free
and
voluntary
stubbornness
to
confirm
us
in
our
belief
it
is
for
that
reason
that
he
allows
them
a
place
among
the
but
in
the
meanwhile
put
in
the
duke
they
rob
us
of
our
money
and
destroy
our
national
and
they
insult
the
army
said
general
cartier
de
chalmot
or
rather
it
is
insulted
by
the
wretches
in
their
and
that
is
a
crime
remarked
the
abbé
gently
the
salvation
of
france
depends
upon
the
alliance
of
the
church
and
the
well
then
l
abbé
why
do
you
defend
the
jews
demanded
the
duc
de
brécé
far
from
defending
them
replied
the
abbé
guitrel
i
condemn
their
unpardonable
sin
which
is
to
deny
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
on
this
point
their
obstinacy
is
invincible
their
own
belief
is
rational
enough
but
they
do
not
believe
all
that
they
should
and
that
is
why
they
have
drawn
so
heavy
a
blame
upon
themselves
this
blame
rests
upon
the
jews
as
a
nation
and
not
as
individuals
and
can
not
touch
any
who
have
been
converted
to
for
my
part
said
the
duke
converted
jews
are
just
as
odious
to
me
more
odious
even
than
other
jews
it
is
the
race
i
allow
me
to
say
i
do
not
believe
you
le
duc
said
the
abbé
for
that
would
be
to
sin
against
charity
and
the
teaching
of
the
church
i
am
sure
that
like
myself
you
are
grateful
to
a
certain
extent
to
some
unconverted
jews
for
their
liberal
donations
towards
our
charities
it
is
impossible
to
deny
for
instance
that
families
like
the
r
and
the
f
have
in
this
respect
shown
an
example
which
might
well
be
followed
by
all
christian
families
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
madame
although
not
openly
converted
to
catholicism
has
on
several
occasions
given
proof
of
truly
divine
inspiration
it
is
to
the
wife
that
we
owe
the
tolerance
with
which
in
the
midst
of
general
persecution
our
church
schools
are
regarded
in
this
department
as
for
madame
de
bonmont
who
is
a
jewess
by
birth
she
is
a
true
christian
indeed
and
takes
pattern
to
a
certain
extent
by
those
holy
widows
who
in
centuries
past
gave
a
part
of
their
riches
to
the
churches
and
the
the
bonmonts
real
name
is
gutenberg
put
in
lerond
they
are
of
german
extraction
the
grandfather
amassed
his
riches
by
the
manufacture
of
the
two
poisons
absinth
and
vermuth
and
was
imprisoned
no
less
than
three
times
for
infringement
and
adulteration
the
father
who
was
a
manufacturer
and
a
financier
made
a
scandalous
fortune
through
speculation
and
monopoly
subsequently
his
widow
presented
a
golden
ciborium
to
monseigneur
charlot
that
sort
of
people
always
makes
me
think
of
the
two
attorneys
who
after
listening
to
a
sermon
by
good
father
maillard
said
to
each
other
at
the
church
door
well
neighbour
have
we
got
to
disgorge
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
said
lerond
that
the
semitic
question
has
never
arisen
in
that
is
because
the
english
are
not
made
the
same
as
we
are
said
the
duke
their
blood
is
not
so
hot
as
true
said
lerond
i
fully
appreciate
that
remark
but
it
may
arise
from
the
fact
that
the
english
engage
all
their
capital
in
trade
while
our
population
save
theirs
for
speculation
in
other
words
for
the
jews
the
whole
trouble
arises
from
having
to
submit
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
revolution
salvation
lies
in
a
speedy
return
to
the
old
that
s
true
said
the
duc
de
brécé
thoughtfully
they
walked
along
chatting
as
they
went
suddenly
a
passed
them
bowling
along
the
road
thrown
open
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
by
the
late
duke
filled
with
laughing
noisy
people
it
went
swiftly
past
them
amongst
the
countrywomen
with
their
hats
and
the
farmers
in
blouses
sat
a
jovial
fellow
smoking
a
pipe
he
was
pretending
to
aim
at
imaginary
pheasants
with
his
cane
as
they
passed
by
it
was
cotard
member
for
the
brécé
district
member
for
the
ancient
seigniory
of
brécé
that
at
any
rate
is
a
strange
sight
said
lerond
brushing
off
the
dust
raised
by
the
to
see
cotard
the
medical
officer
of
health
representing
this
district
upon
which
your
ancestors
le
duc
showered
benefits
and
glories
for
eight
hundred
years
only
yesterday
i
was
rereading
in
de
terremondre
s
book
the
letter
which
your
the
duc
de
brécé
wrote
in
to
his
steward
and
which
proves
how
he
was
you
remember
the
letter
do
you
not
the
duke
replied
that
he
remembered
the
letter
in
question
but
could
not
be
sure
of
the
precise
terms
employed
lerond
immediately
began
to
recite
by
heart
the
principal
phrases
of
this
touching
letter
i
have
learned
wrote
the
good
duke
that
the
inhabitants
of
brécé
are
forbidden
to
gather
strawberries
in
the
woods
people
are
evidently
doing
their
best
to
make
me
disliked
and
that
would
be
a
terrible
grief
to
i
have
also
found
continued
lerond
some
interesting
details
on
the
life
of
the
good
duc
de
brécé
in
de
terremondre
s
summary
the
duke
spent
the
worst
days
of
the
revolution
here
on
his
estate
without
being
in
any
way
molested
for
his
good
deeds
gained
him
the
love
and
respect
of
his
old
retainers
in
exchange
for
the
titles
of
which
by
a
decree
of
the
national
assembly
he
was
deprived
he
received
that
of
commander
of
the
national
guard
of
brécé
de
terremondre
goes
on
to
tell
us
that
on
the
of
september
the
municipality
of
brécé
assembled
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
and
there
planted
a
tree
to
liberty
to
which
was
suspended
this
inscription
hommage
à
la
vertu
m
de
terremondre
returned
the
duke
drew
his
information
from
the
archives
of
my
family
i
myself
asked
him
to
go
into
them
for
unfortunately
i
have
never
had
the
time
to
do
so
duke
louis
de
brécé
of
whom
you
were
speaking
surnamed
the
good
duke
died
of
grief
in
he
was
gifted
with
a
kindness
of
disposition
which
even
the
revolutionists
themselves
delighted
to
honour
every
one
recognizes
the
fact
that
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
loyalty
to
his
king
that
he
was
a
good
master
a
good
father
and
a
good
husband
you
must
take
no
notice
of
the
revelations
of
a
man
called
mazure
who
is
keeper
of
the
departmental
archives
according
to
him
the
good
duke
s
benevolence
was
confined
to
his
prettiest
vassals
on
whom
he
liked
to
exercise
his
droit
de
as
far
as
that
goes
this
particular
right
to
which
i
allude
is
of
a
very
problematical
nature
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
a
trace
of
it
among
the
brécé
archives
which
by
the
way
have
been
in
part
this
right
said
lerond
if
it
ever
did
exist
at
all
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
payment
in
meat
or
wine
which
serfs
were
called
upon
to
bring
to
their
lord
before
contracting
marriage
if
i
remember
rightly
there
were
certain
localities
where
this
tax
existed
and
was
paid
in
ready
money
to
the
value
of
three
with
regard
to
that
went
on
the
duke
i
consider
my
ancestor
entirely
exonerated
from
the
accusations
brought
against
him
by
this
mazure
who
i
am
told
is
a
dangerous
man
unfortunately
the
duke
heaved
a
slight
sigh
and
continued
in
a
lower
and
mysterious
voice
unfortunately
the
good
duke
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
pernicious
books
whole
editions
of
voltaire
and
rousseau
bound
in
morocco
and
stamped
with
the
brécé
coat
of
arms
have
been
discovered
in
the
castle
library
he
fell
to
a
certain
extent
under
the
detestable
influence
of
the
philosophical
thought
that
was
rampant
among
all
classes
of
people
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
even
among
those
in
the
highest
society
he
was
possessed
of
a
mania
for
writing
and
was
the
author
of
certain
memoirs
the
manuscript
of
which
is
still
in
my
possession
both
the
duchess
and
de
terremondre
have
glanced
through
it
it
is
surprising
to
find
there
traces
of
the
voltairian
spirit
and
the
duke
now
and
then
shows
his
partiality
for
the
encyclopædists
he
used
in
fact
to
correspond
with
diderot
that
is
why
i
have
thought
it
wise
to
withhold
my
consent
to
the
publication
of
these
memoirs
in
spite
of
the
request
of
some
of
the
savants
of
the
district
and
of
de
terremondre
himself
the
good
duke
could
turn
a
rhyme
quite
prettily
and
he
filled
whole
books
with
madrigals
epigrams
and
stories
that
is
quite
excusable
a
far
more
serious
matter
however
is
that
he
sometimes
permitted
himself
to
jeer
at
the
ceremonies
of
our
holy
religion
and
even
at
the
miracles
performed
by
the
intervention
of
i
beg
gentlemen
that
you
will
say
nothing
of
all
this
it
must
remain
strictly
between
ourselves
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
hand
over
anecdotes
such
as
these
to
feed
the
unhealthy
curiosity
of
men
like
mazure
and
the
malice
of
the
public
in
general
the
duc
de
brécé
in
question
was
my
and
my
family
pride
is
great
i
am
sure
you
will
not
blame
me
for
much
valuable
instruction
and
great
consolations
are
to
be
derived
from
what
you
have
just
related
to
us
monsieur
said
the
abbé
the
conclusion
we
arrive
at
is
that
france
which
in
the
eighteenth
century
had
turned
away
from
christianity
and
was
so
steeped
in
wickedness
even
to
the
very
greatest
in
the
land
that
good
men
such
as
your
noble
pandered
to
the
false
philosophy
france
i
say
punished
for
her
crimes
by
a
terrible
revolution
is
now
amending
her
evil
ways
and
witnessing
the
return
to
piety
of
all
classes
of
the
nation
especially
in
the
highest
circles
examples
such
as
yours
monsieur
are
not
to
be
ignored
and
if
the
eighteenth
century
taken
altogether
appears
as
the
century
of
crime
the
nineteenth
judging
by
the
attitude
of
the
aristocracy
may
if
i
mistake
not
be
called
the
century
of
public
god
grant
that
you
are
right
sighed
lerond
but
i
dare
not
allow
myself
to
hope
my
profession
as
a
man
of
law
brings
me
into
contact
with
the
masses
and
i
invariably
find
them
indifferent
and
even
hostile
to
religion
let
me
tell
you
l
abbé
that
my
experience
of
the
world
leads
me
to
share
in
the
deep
sorrow
of
the
abbé
lantaigne
and
not
in
your
optimistic
view
of
things
now
without
going
further
afield
do
you
not
see
that
this
christian
land
of
brécé
has
become
the
fief
of
the
atheist
and
freemason
cotard
and
who
can
say
demanded
the
general
whether
the
duke
will
not
unseat
cotard
at
the
next
elections
i
am
told
that
a
contest
is
more
than
probable
and
that
a
good
number
of
electors
are
in
favour
of
the
my
decision
is
unalterable
replied
the
duke
and
nothing
can
make
me
change
it
i
shall
not
stand
again
i
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
to
represent
the
electors
of
brécé
and
the
electors
of
brécé
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
for
me
to
wish
to
represent
this
speech
had
been
composed
by
his
secretary
lacrisse
at
the
time
of
his
electoral
reverse
and
since
then
he
had
made
a
point
of
quoting
it
on
every
possible
occasion
just
at
that
moment
three
ladies
descending
the
terrace
steps
came
along
the
great
drive
towards
them
they
were
the
three
brécé
ladies
the
mother
wife
and
daughter
of
the
present
duke
they
were
all
tall
massive
and
freckled
with
smooth
hair
tightly
plastered
back
and
clad
in
black
dresses
and
thick
boots
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
church
of
situated
by
the
side
of
a
well
between
the
town
and
the
château
the
general
suggested
that
they
should
accompany
the
ladies
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
said
lerond
true
assented
the
abbé
and
all
the
more
so
because
the
sacred
edifice
which
has
lately
been
restored
and
richly
redecorated
by
the
care
of
the
duke
is
most
delightful
to
the
abbé
guitrel
took
a
special
interest
in
the
chapel
of
of
which
in
archæological
and
pious
vein
he
had
written
a
history
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
pilgrims
to
the
shrine
according
to
him
the
church
dated
from
the
reign
of
clotaire
ii
at
this
period
wrote
the
historian
st
austrégisile
full
of
years
and
good
works
and
exhausted
by
his
apostolic
labours
built
with
his
own
hands
in
this
desert
spot
a
hut
where
he
could
pass
his
days
in
meditation
and
await
the
approach
of
blessed
death
he
also
erected
an
oratory
in
which
he
placed
a
miraculous
statue
of
the
blessed
this
assertion
had
been
vigorously
contested
by
mazure
in
the
the
keeper
of
the
departmental
archives
maintained
that
the
worship
of
mary
came
well
after
the
sixth
century
and
that
at
the
time
in
which
austrégisile
was
supposed
to
have
lived
there
were
no
statues
of
the
virgin
to
which
the
abbé
guitrel
replied
in
the
that
before
the
birth
of
jesus
christ
the
druids
themselves
worshipped
the
image
of
the
virgin
who
was
to
bear
a
son
and
thus
our
old
earth
that
was
to
witness
the
remarkable
spread
of
the
worship
of
mary
contained
her
altars
and
images
prophetic
in
significance
as
the
warnings
of
the
sibyls
to
herald
her
appearance
upon
it
therefore
argued
he
there
was
nothing
strange
in
austrégisile
s
possessing
an
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
as
early
as
the
reign
of
clotaire
ii
mazure
had
treated
the
arguments
of
the
abbé
as
idle
fancies
and
no
one
save
bergeret
whose
curiosity
was
unbounded
had
read
the
record
of
this
logomachy
the
sanctuary
erected
by
the
holy
apostle
went
on
the
abbé
guitrel
s
pamphlet
was
rebuilt
with
great
magnificence
in
the
thirteenth
century
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
religion
that
devastated
the
country
during
the
sixteenth
century
the
protestants
fired
the
chapel
without
however
being
able
to
destroy
the
statue
which
by
a
miracle
escaped
the
flames
the
church
was
rebuilt
at
the
behest
of
king
louis
xiv
and
his
pious
mother
but
during
the
reign
of
terror
was
totally
destroyed
by
the
commissioners
of
the
convention
who
carried
the
miraculous
statue
together
with
the
furniture
of
the
chapel
into
the
courtyard
at
brécé
and
made
a
bonfire
of
the
whole
fortunately
however
one
of
the
virgin
s
feet
was
saved
from
the
flames
by
a
good
who
wrapped
it
carefully
in
old
rags
and
hid
it
in
a
cauldron
where
it
was
discovered
in
this
foot
was
included
in
a
new
statue
which
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
the
duke
was
executed
in
paris
in
the
abbé
guitrel
went
on
to
enumerate
the
miracles
accomplished
from
the
sixth
century
up
to
the
present
time
by
the
intervention
of
who
was
in
particular
request
for
the
cure
of
diseases
of
the
respiratory
organs
and
the
lungs
and
he
further
affirmed
that
in
she
had
turned
the
germans
aside
from
the
town
and
miraculously
healed
of
their
wounds
two
soldiers
quartered
at
the
château
of
brécé
which
had
been
turned
into
a
hospital
they
reached
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
valley
with
a
stream
flowing
between
stones
on
an
irregular
platform
of
sandstone
surrounded
by
dwarf
oak
trees
rose
the
oratory
of
newly
constructed
from
the
plans
of
quatrebarbe
the
diocesan
architect
in
that
modern
style
which
people
fondly
imagine
to
be
gothic
this
oratory
said
the
abbé
guitrel
was
burned
down
in
by
the
calvinists
and
again
in
by
the
revolutionaries
and
nothing
remained
but
a
mass
of
ruins
like
another
nehemiah
the
duc
de
brécé
has
rebuilt
the
sanctuary
the
pope
this
year
has
granted
to
it
numerous
indulgences
no
doubt
with
the
object
of
quickening
the
worship
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
this
country
monseigneur
charlot
himself
celebrated
the
holy
eucharist
here
and
since
then
pilgrims
have
flocked
to
the
shrine
they
come
from
all
parts
of
the
diocese
and
even
farther
there
is
no
doubt
that
such
and
zeal
must
draw
special
blessings
on
the
country
i
myself
had
the
felicity
of
bringing
to
the
feet
of
la
vierge
des
several
respectable
families
of
the
tintelleries
and
with
the
permission
of
the
duke
i
have
more
than
once
celebrated
mass
at
this
favoured
that
is
true
said
the
duchess
and
it
is
noticeable
that
the
abbé
takes
more
interest
in
our
chapel
than
the
curé
of
brécé
good
traviès
said
the
duke
he
is
an
excellent
priest
but
an
inveterate
sportsman
and
all
he
thinks
of
is
shooting
the
other
day
on
returning
from
the
administration
of
extreme
unction
to
a
dying
man
he
brought
down
three
now
that
the
branches
are
devoid
of
leaves
said
the
abbé
you
can
see
the
chapel
which
in
the
summer
is
entirely
hidden
by
the
thick
one
of
the
reasons
which
made
me
determine
to
rebuild
the
chapel
of
said
the
duke
was
that
on
examining
the
family
archives
i
found
that
the
of
the
brécés
was
brécé
how
very
strange
remarked
general
cartier
de
chalmot
is
it
not
replied
madame
de
brécé
just
as
the
ladies
followed
by
lerond
were
crossing
the
rustic
bridge
that
spans
the
stream
a
ragged
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
with
hair
of
the
same
dirty
white
colour
as
her
face
slipping
from
a
copse
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hollow
ran
up
the
steps
and
rushed
into
the
oratory
there
s
honorine
said
madame
de
brécé
i
ve
been
wanting
to
see
her
for
a
long
time
said
lerond
and
i
must
thank
you
madame
for
being
the
means
of
satisfying
my
curiosity
i
have
heard
so
much
about
her
yes
indeed
said
general
cartier
de
chalmot
the
young
girl
in
question
has
been
subjected
to
many
and
searching
m
de
goulet
put
in
the
abbé
comes
regularly
to
the
sanctuary
of
it
is
his
pleasure
and
delight
to
spend
long
hours
in
adoration
of
her
whom
he
calls
his
we
are
very
fond
of
de
goulet
said
madame
de
brécé
what
a
pity
it
is
that
he
should
be
so
yes
alas
replied
the
abbé
his
strength
diminishes
from
day
to
day
he
ought
to
take
more
care
of
himself
went
on
the
duchess
and
rest
as
much
as
how
can
he
madame
asked
the
abbé
the
management
of
the
diocese
fills
up
every
moment
of
his
as
the
three
ladies
the
general
guitrel
lerond
and
the
duke
entered
the
chapel
they
saw
honorine
as
in
an
ecstasy
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
with
clasped
hands
and
uplifted
head
the
child
knelt
there
motionless
out
of
respect
for
her
mysterious
condition
they
crossed
themselves
silently
with
holy
water
letting
their
gaze
wander
from
the
gothic
tabernacle
and
fall
upon
the
windows
in
which
the
comte
de
chambord
appeared
in
the
guise
of
henry
while
the
faces
of
john
the
baptist
and
st
guy
were
executed
from
photographs
of
comte
jean
who
died
in
and
the
late
comte
guy
who
in
was
a
member
of
the
bordeaux
assembly
the
miraculous
statue
was
covered
by
a
veil
and
stood
just
over
the
altar
but
above
the
stoup
painted
in
bright
colours
upon
the
wall
was
a
figure
of
de
lourdes
girdled
with
blue
the
general
looked
at
her
with
a
set
expression
derived
from
fifty
years
of
mechanical
respect
and
gazed
at
her
blue
scarf
as
though
it
had
been
the
flag
of
a
friendly
nation
he
had
always
been
looked
upon
as
something
of
a
mystic
and
had
considered
a
belief
in
the
future
life
to
be
the
very
base
and
of
military
regulations
age
and
were
making
a
devotee
of
him
for
some
days
past
though
he
did
not
betray
it
he
had
been
if
not
worried
at
any
rate
grieved
by
the
recent
scandals
his
had
taken
fright
at
such
a
tumult
of
words
and
passions
and
he
was
obsessed
by
vague
misgivings
he
sent
up
a
voiceless
prayer
to
de
lourdes
imploring
her
protection
for
the
french
army
all
of
them
the
women
the
duke
the
lawyer
and
the
priest
had
by
this
time
riveted
their
gaze
upon
the
worn
shoes
of
the
motionless
honorine
and
these
sombre
solemn
solid
folk
fell
into
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
at
the
sight
of
the
lithe
young
body
now
stiff
and
rigid
lerond
who
prided
himself
on
being
very
observant
made
sundry
observations
at
last
however
honorine
came
out
of
her
trance
she
rose
to
her
feet
bowed
to
the
altar
and
turned
round
then
as
though
astonished
at
the
sight
of
so
many
people
stood
stock
still
and
brushed
away
with
both
hands
the
hair
that
had
fallen
over
her
eyes
well
my
child
did
you
see
the
blessed
virgin
asked
madame
de
brécé
in
the
shrill
voice
of
a
child
in
the
catechism
class
answering
by
rote
honorine
replied
yes
madame
the
good
virgin
remained
for
one
moment
then
rolled
up
like
a
piece
of
calico
and
i
didn
t
see
her
any
did
she
speak
to
you
yes
what
did
she
say
she
said
there
is
much
misery
in
your
is
that
all
she
said
she
said
there
will
be
much
misery
in
the
country
over
the
harvests
and
the
did
she
not
tell
you
to
be
good
pray
continually
she
said
to
me
and
then
she
said
like
this
i
greet
you
there
is
much
misery
in
your
and
the
words
of
the
child
rang
out
in
the
imposing
silence
was
the
blessed
virgin
very
beautiful
again
questioned
madame
de
brécé
yes
madame
but
one
eye
and
one
cheek
were
missing
because
i
had
not
prayed
long
had
she
a
crown
upon
her
head
asked
lerond
who
as
an
of
the
magistracy
was
inquisitive
and
fond
of
asking
questions
honorine
hesitated
and
then
with
a
cunning
look
replied
her
crown
was
on
one
right
or
left
asked
lerond
right
and
left
answered
honorine
madame
de
brécé
intervened
what
do
you
mean
my
child
that
it
was
first
on
the
right
and
then
on
the
left
isn
t
that
what
you
mean
but
honorine
would
not
answer
she
was
in
the
habit
sometimes
of
indulging
in
obstinate
silences
standing
as
now
with
lowered
eyes
rubbing
her
chin
on
her
shoulder
and
fidgeting
they
stopped
questioning
her
and
she
slipped
out
and
away
when
the
duke
began
forthwith
to
explain
her
case
honorine
porrichet
the
daughter
of
a
small
farmer
who
had
lived
all
his
life
at
brécé
and
had
fallen
into
the
direst
poverty
had
always
been
a
sickly
child
her
intelligence
had
developed
so
slowly
and
tardily
that
at
first
she
was
looked
upon
as
an
idiot
the
curé
used
to
reproach
her
for
her
wild
disposition
and
the
habit
she
had
of
hiding
in
the
woods
he
did
not
like
her
but
some
enlightened
priests
who
saw
and
questioned
her
could
find
in
her
nothing
evil
she
frequented
churches
and
would
linger
there
lost
in
dreams
unusual
in
a
child
of
her
age
her
zeal
grew
at
the
approach
of
her
first
communion
at
that
time
she
fell
a
victim
to
consumption
and
the
doctors
gave
her
up
cotard
among
others
said
there
was
no
hope
for
her
when
the
new
oratory
of
was
inaugurated
by
monseigneur
charlot
honorine
assiduously
frequented
it
she
fell
into
ecstasies
when
there
and
saw
visions
she
saw
the
blessed
virgin
who
said
to
her
i
am
one
day
mary
approached
her
and
laying
a
finger
upon
her
throat
told
her
she
was
cured
it
was
honorine
herself
who
came
back
with
this
remarkable
story
added
the
duke
and
she
related
it
several
times
with
the
utmost
simplicity
people
have
said
that
her
story
was
never
twice
the
same
what
is
certain
however
is
that
any
inconsistency
on
her
part
only
concerned
the
minor
details
of
the
narrative
what
is
also
certain
is
that
she
suddenly
ceased
to
suffer
from
the
disease
that
was
killing
her
the
doctors
who
examined
and
sounded
her
immediately
after
the
miraculous
apparition
found
nothing
wrong
either
with
the
bronchial
tubes
or
the
lungs
cotard
himself
confessed
that
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
what
do
you
think
of
these
facts
said
lerond
to
the
abbé
they
are
worthy
of
attention
replied
the
priest
and
give
rise
in
all
honest
observers
to
more
than
one
reflexion
it
would
certainly
be
impossible
to
study
them
too
assiduously
i
can
say
no
more
i
should
certainly
never
put
aside
such
interesting
and
consoling
facts
with
bold
contempt
like
lantaigne
neither
should
i
dare
like
de
goulet
to
call
them
miracles
i
reserve
my
in
honorine
porrichet
s
case
said
the
duke
we
must
consider
both
the
remarkable
cure
which
i
am
right
in
saying
was
directly
opposed
to
medical
knowledge
and
the
visions
which
she
declares
to
be
vouchsafed
to
her
now
you
are
aware
l
abbé
that
when
the
girl
s
eyes
were
photographed
during
one
of
her
trances
the
negatives
obtained
by
the
photographer
of
whose
good
faith
there
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
contained
the
figure
of
the
blessed
virgin
imprinted
upon
the
pupil
of
the
eye
certain
persons
whose
evidence
can
be
relied
on
swear
to
having
seen
the
photographs
and
to
having
distinguished
with
the
aid
of
a
strong
the
statue
of
these
facts
are
worthy
of
notice
repeated
the
abbé
worthy
of
the
most
careful
attention
but
one
must
be
able
to
suspend
judgment
and
not
rush
to
premature
conclusions
let
us
not
like
the
unbelievers
form
hasty
conclusions
prompted
by
passion
in
the
matter
of
miracles
the
church
exercises
the
greatest
caution
she
requires
proofs
indisputable
lerond
asked
whether
it
were
possible
to
obtain
the
photographs
which
portrayed
the
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
the
eyes
of
little
honorine
porrichet
and
the
duke
promised
to
write
on
the
subject
to
the
photographer
whose
studio
he
thought
was
in
the
place
anyhow
put
in
madame
de
brécé
little
honorine
is
a
very
good
nice
little
girl
she
must
be
under
the
special
protection
of
providence
for
her
parents
who
are
overcome
with
illness
and
want
have
abandoned
her
i
have
made
inquiries
and
understand
that
her
conduct
is
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
all
the
village
girls
of
her
age
added
the
dowager
duchess
that
is
only
too
true
said
the
duke
the
peasant
classes
are
growing
more
and
more
demoralized
i
will
tell
you
of
some
terrible
instances
general
but
as
for
little
honorine
she
is
innocence
while
the
foregoing
conversation
was
being
held
on
the
threshold
of
the
church
honorine
had
rejoined
isidore
in
the
copses
of
la
guerche
he
was
lying
on
a
bed
of
dead
leaves
waiting
impatiently
partly
because
he
thought
she
would
bring
him
something
to
eat
or
some
coppers
partly
because
he
loved
her
for
she
was
his
sweetheart
it
was
he
who
had
seen
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
the
château
on
their
way
to
the
church
and
had
immediately
sought
out
honorine
to
give
her
time
to
reach
the
church
before
them
and
to
fall
into
a
trance
what
have
they
given
you
he
demanded
let
me
and
as
she
had
brought
nothing
he
struck
her
but
without
hurting
her
very
much
in
return
she
scratched
and
bit
him
then
said
what
s
that
for
swear
that
they
didn
t
give
you
anything
he
said
she
swore
and
having
sucked
away
the
blood
that
was
trickling
down
their
thin
arms
they
were
reconciled
then
for
the
want
of
something
better
to
do
they
fell
back
upon
the
pleasure
that
each
was
able
to
bestow
upon
the
other
isidore
whose
mother
was
a
widow
a
bad
woman
given
to
drink
had
no
recognized
father
he
spent
all
his
time
in
the
woods
and
nobody
bothered
about
him
although
he
was
two
years
younger
than
honorine
he
was
well
versed
in
the
practices
of
love
about
the
only
need
in
his
life
of
which
he
found
no
lack
under
the
trees
of
la
guerche
lénonville
and
brécé
his
with
honorine
was
only
by
way
of
killing
time
and
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
occasionally
honorine
would
be
roused
to
a
certain
amount
of
interest
but
she
could
not
attach
much
importance
to
such
commonplace
everyday
actions
and
a
rabbit
a
bird
or
an
insect
would
often
be
enough
to
change
the
entire
current
of
their
thoughts
de
brécé
returned
to
the
château
with
his
guests
the
cold
walls
of
the
hall
bristled
with
the
evidences
of
massacre
antlers
of
deer
heads
of
young
stags
and
of
old
veterans
which
in
spite
of
the
taxidermist
s
care
were
and
retained
in
their
staring
glass
eyes
something
of
the
agonized
sweat
of
a
creature
at
bay
equivalent
to
human
tears
horns
antlers
bleached
bones
severed
heads
trophies
by
means
of
which
the
victims
honoured
their
illustrious
slayers
the
noblemen
of
france
and
bourbons
of
naples
and
spain
under
the
great
staircase
stood
a
sort
of
amphibious
chariot
shaped
like
a
boat
the
body
of
which
could
be
removed
and
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
crossing
rivers
when
hunting
it
was
looked
upon
as
sacred
because
it
had
once
been
used
by
exiled
kings
the
abbé
guitrel
carefully
placed
his
big
cotton
umbrella
beneath
the
black
visage
of
a
ferocious
wild
boar
and
led
the
way
through
a
door
on
the
left
flanked
by
two
caryatides
by
ducereau
to
a
where
the
three
brécé
ladies
who
had
been
the
first
to
return
were
already
sitting
with
their
friend
and
neighbour
madame
de
courtrai
dressed
in
black
owing
to
the
interminable
series
of
deaths
in
their
own
and
the
royal
family
they
sat
there
nunlike
and
rustic
in
their
extreme
simplicity
chatting
of
marriages
and
deaths
of
illnesses
and
their
remedies
on
the
painted
ceiling
above
them
and
on
the
panelled
walls
amid
the
sombre
rows
of
portraits
one
caught
an
occasional
glimpse
of
a
henri
iv
in
the
embrace
of
a
minerva
or
the
pale
face
of
louis
xiii
in
close
juxtaposition
to
the
heavy
flemish
figures
of
victory
and
mercy
in
loosely
flowing
robes
or
again
the
naked
body
in
hue
of
an
old
man
father
time
sparing
the
fleurs
de
lis
and
anywhere
and
everywhere
the
dimpled
legs
of
little
boys
supporting
the
brécé
coat
of
arms
with
the
three
golden
torches
all
the
while
the
dowager
duchess
was
busy
knitting
black
woollen
scarves
for
the
poor
since
those
far
off
days
when
she
had
embroidered
a
counterpane
for
the
bed
at
chambord
on
which
the
king
was
to
sleep
she
had
knitted
continuously
occupying
her
hands
and
satisfying
her
heart
withal
the
tables
and
consoles
were
covered
with
photographs
in
frames
of
all
colours
and
sizes
some
resembling
easels
some
of
porcelain
or
plush
others
of
crystal
nickel
shagreen
carved
wood
or
stamped
there
were
some
again
like
gilded
others
like
palettes
covered
with
colours
and
brushes
some
shaped
like
chestnut
leaves
or
butterflies
in
this
assortment
of
frames
were
portraits
of
men
women
and
children
relations
by
blood
or
by

of

belonging
to

right
of

in

of
an
old
console
supported
by
gilded
turks
like
a
spiritual
father
monseigneur
charlot
smiled
all
over
his
broad
face
at
the
young
soldiers
grouped
closely
around
him
officers
brigadiers
and
privates
wearing
upon
their
heads
their
necks
and
their
breasts
all
the
martial
decoration
allowed
by
a
democratic
army
to
her
cavalry
he
smiled
at
young
men
dressed
in
cycling
or
polo
kit
he
smiled
at
young
girls
ladies
covered
the
folding
tables
ladies
of
all
ages
some
of
them
with
the
decided
features
of
men
but
a
few
among
them
quite
pretty
mame
de
courtrai
cried
de
brécé
as
he
entered
the
room
behind
the
general
how
are
you
dear
mame
he
then
returned
to
the
conversation
he
had
commenced
with
lerond
in
the
park
and
drawing
him
aside
to
one
of
the
corners
of
the
huge
room
he
concluded
for
when
all
s
said
and
done
the
army
is
all
that
is
left
us
all
that
formerly
made
up
the
glory
and
strength
of
france
has
vanished
leaving
us
the
army
alone
the
republican
parliament
has
overthrown
the
government
compromised
the
magistracy
and
corrupted
public
life
the
army
alone
rears
its
head
above
the
ruins
that
is
why
i
insist
that
to
meddle
with
it
is
nothing
short
of
he
stopped
he
was
never
in
the
habit
of
grappling
with
any
question
and
usually
contented
himself
with
generalities
the
nobility
of
his
sentiments
was
contested
by
none
madame
de
courtrai
who
until
then
had
been
lost
in
reflection
as
to
the
best
way
of
preparing
cooling
draughts
suddenly
looked
up
turning
her
old
gamekeeper
s
face
to
the
duke
and
remarked
i
do
trust
you
have
written
to
the
proprietors
of
that
paper
which
is
in
league
with
the
enemies
of
france
and
the
army
saying
that
you
intend
to
discontinue
it
my
husband
sent
back
the
number
containing
that
article
you
know
the
one
i
mean
that
disgraceful
my
nephew
writes
to
me
replied
the
duke
that
a
notice
has
been
posted
up
at
his
club
insisting
that
the
subscription
to
it
shall
be
given
up
and
i
hear
that
signatures
are
coming
in
thick
and
fast
nearly
all
the
members
fall
in
with
the
suggestion
reserving
the
right
to
buy
any
single
the
army
is
above
all
attack
said
lerond
general
cartier
de
chalmot
at
length
broke
the
silence
in
which
until
then
he
had
been
wrapped
i
like
to
hear
you
say
that
and
if
like
myself
you
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
your
life
among
soldiers
you
would
be
agreeably
surprised
to
note
the
qualities
of
endurance
good
discipline
and
good
temper
which
make
of
the
french
trooper
a
implement
of
war
i
never
tire
of
repeating
it
such
units
are
equal
to
any
task
with
the
authority
of
an
officer
whose
life
s
career
is
drawing
to
a
close
i
maintain
that
anyone
who
takes
the
trouble
to
inquire
into
the
spirit
which
animates
the
french
army
will
find
it
worthy
of
the
highest
praise
in
the
same
way
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
testify
to
the
persevering
effort
of
several
officers
of
high
standing
and
great
capacity
who
have
devoted
much
time
and
thought
to
the
organization
of
the
army
and
i
declare
that
their
efforts
have
been
crowned
with
brilliant
in
a
lower
and
more
serious
voice
he
added
all
that
now
remains
for
me
to
say
is
that
as
far
as
the
men
are
concerned
quality
is
to
be
preferred
to
quantity
and
what
should
be
aimed
at
is
the
formation
of
crack
corps
i
feel
certain
that
no
capable
officer
would
contradict
such
an
assertion
my
last
military
will
and
testament
is
contained
in
this
formula
quantity
is
nothing
quality
is
i
might
add
that
unity
of
command
is
indispensable
to
an
army
and
that
a
great
body
of
men
must
obey
one
unique
sovereign
and
immutable
will
and
one
he
ceased
speaking
his
pale
eyes
full
of
tears
confused
inexplicable
feelings
filled
the
soul
of
the
honest
old
man
who
in
former
days
had
been
the
most
dashing
captain
of
the
imperial
guard
his
health
was
failing
his
strength
exhausted
and
he
felt
himself
lost
amongst
the
officers
of
the
modern
school
whom
he
could
not
understand
madame
de
courtrai
who
did
not
care
for
theories
turned
her
fierce
masculine
old
face
towards
the
general
well
general
as
thank
god
the
army
is
respected
by
every
one
as
you
say
it
is
the
only
force
that
keeps
us
together
why
should
it
not
also
rule
us
why
not
send
a
colonel
with
his
regiment
to
the
palais
bourbon
and
the
élysée
she
stopped
short
as
she
saw
the
clouded
brow
of
the
general
the
duke
beckoned
to
lerond
you
have
never
seen
the
library
have
you
lerond
i
will
show
it
to
you
you
are
fond
of
old
books
and
i
am
sure
you
will
be
traversing
a
long
bare
gallery
the
ceiling
of
which
was
covered
with
clumsy
painting
depicting
louis
xiii
and
apollo
destroying
the
enemies
of
the
kingdom
as
represented
by
furies
and
hydras
they
arrived
at
a
door
through
which
the
duke
ushered
the
counsel
for
the
defence
of
the
religious
communities
into
the
room
where
in
duc
guy
of
france
and
governor
of
the
province
had
founded
the
library
for
the
solace
of
his
declining
years
and
fortunes
it
was
a
square
room
occupying
the
whole
of
the
ground
floor
of
the
west
wing
lighted
on
the
north
west
and
south
by
three
uncurtained
windows
offering
three
charming
and
magnificent
pictures
to
the
eye
stretching
away
to
the
south
was
the
lawn
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
marble
vase
with
a
pair
of
perching
upon
it
the
trees
of
the
park
were
visible
bared
by
the
winter
of
their
leaves
and
in
the
purple
depths
of
the
dark
walk
glimmered
the
white
statues
of
the
pool
of
galatea
to
the
west
was
a
stretch
of
flat
country
a
wide
expanse
of
sky
and
the
setting
sun
which
like
a
mythological
egg
of
light
and
of
gold
had
broken
and
spread
its
glory
over
the
clouds
to
the
north
were
the
ploughed
red
earth
of
the
hills
the
slate
roofs
and
distant
smoke
of
brécé
and
the
delicate
pointed
steeple
of
the
little
church
standing
out
in
the
cold
clear
light
a
louis
xiv
table
two
chairs
and
a
globe
with
a
relating
to
the
unexplored
regions
of
the
pacific
comprised
the
only
furniture
of
this
room
the
walls
of
which
were
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
bookcases
enclosed
by
wire
gratings
even
upon
the
red
marble
mantelpiece
the
shelves
encroached
and
through
the
mesh
of
gilded
wire
peeped
the
richly
decorated
backs
of
ancient
volumes
the
library
was
founded
by
the
marshal
said
de
brécé
his
grandson
duc
jean
added
many
treasures
to
it
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
and
it
was
he
who
fitted
it
up
as
you
see
it
it
has
not
been
much
altered
have
you
a
catalogue
inquired
lerond
the
duke
said
that
he
had
not
that
de
terremondre
who
was
a
great
lover
of
valuable
books
had
warmly
recommended
him
to
have
them
catalogued
but
he
had
never
yet
found
time
to
have
it
done
he
opened
one
of
the
cases
and
lerond
drew
out
several
volumes
in
succession
octavo
quarto
and
folio
bound
in
marbled
stippled
or
parchment
and
red
and
blue
morocco
all
bearing
on
their
covers
the
coat
of
arms
with
the
three
torches
surmounted
by
a
ducal
crown
lerond
was
not
a
keen
but
on
opening
a
beautifully
written
manuscript
on
royal
tithes
presented
to
the
marshal
by
vauban
his
astonishment
and
admiration
knew
no
bounds
the
manuscript
was
further
embellished
with
a
frontispiece
besides
several
vignettes
and
are
these
original
drawings
asked
lerond
very
probably
replied
de
brécé
they
are
signed
went
on
lerond
and
i
think
i
can
decipher
the
name
of
sebastian
maybe
answered
de
brécé
these
priceless
shelves
contained
as
lerond
remarked
books
by
tillemont
on
roman
and
church
history
the
statute
book
of
the
province
and
innumerable
by
old
doctors
at
law
he
unearthed
works
on
theology
on
controversy
and
on
hagiology
long
genealogical
histories
old
editions
of
greek
and
latin
classics
and
some
of
those
enormous
books
bigger
than
atlases
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
a
king
or
his
entry
into
paris
or
to
celebrate
his
convalescence
or
his
victories
this
is
the
oldest
part
of
the
library
said
de
brécé
the
marshal
s
collection
here
he
added
opening
two
or
three
other
cases
are
the
additions
of
duc
louis
xvi
s
minister
surnamed
the
good
duke
asked
lerond
just
so
replied
de
brécé
duc
jean
s
collection
took
up
all
that
side
of
the
wall
containing
the
mantelpiece
and
also
the
side
looking
out
upon
the
little
town
lerond
read
out
the
titles
stamped
in
gold
between
two
bands
that
decorated
the
backs
of
the
volumes
de
de
de
rousseau
de
l
abbé
mably
de
and
des
établissements
européens
dans
les
by
raynal
he
then
glanced
through
the
lesser
poets
and
romancers
with
the
vignettes
of
grécourt
dorat
and
the
boccaccio
illustrated
by
marillier
and
the
edition
of
la
fontaine
published
by
the
fermiers
the
pictures
are
rather
free
remarked
the
duke
i
have
been
compelled
to
destroy
certain
works
of
the
same
period
the
illustrations
of
which
were
really
lerond
however
discovered
side
by
side
with
these
frivolous
books
a
lengthy
series
of
political
and
philosophical
works
essays
on
slavery
printed
accounts
of
the
american
war
of
independence
he
opened
d
un
and
saw
that
the
margins
were
covered
with
notes
in
duc
jean
s
handwriting
he
read
aloud
the
author
is
right
man
is
naturally
good
and
the
mistaken
social
laws
alone
are
responsible
for
his
evil
that
he
added
is
what
your
wrote
in
how
very
curious
remarked
the
duke
replacing
the
book
upon
its
shelf
then
opening
the
cases
upon
the
north
side
of
the
room
he
said
these
are
the
books
collected
by
my
grandfather
who
was
page
to
charles
here
lerond
discovered
bound
in
sombre
sheepskin
tan
calf
and
black
shagreen
the
works
of
chateaubriand
a
series
of
mémoires
on
the
revolution
the
histories
of
anquetil
guizot
and
augustin
thierry
la
harpe
s
de
marchangy
s
and
the
of
lainé
close
to
this
literature
dealing
with
the
restoration
and
the
government
of
july
was
a
shelf
on
which
lay
two
or
three
tattered
papers
on
pope
pius
ix
and
temporal
power
a
few
dilapidated
novels
a
pamphlet
in
praise
of
joan
of
arc
which
had
been
read
by
monseigneur
charlot
in
the
church
of
on
the
of
june
and
a
few
religious
books
written
for
ladies
of
high
degree
this
was
the
contribution
of
the
late
duke
member
of
the
national
assembly
in
and
of
the
present
duc
de
brécé
to
the
library
created
by
the
marshal
in
i
must
lock
up
these
books
said
de
brécé
i
can
not
be
too
careful
for
my
sons
are
growing
up
and
at
any
moment
may
be
seized
with
the
desire
to
come
and
examine
the
library
for
themselves
there
are
books
among
these
which
should
never
fall
into
the
hands
of
any
young
man
nor
of
any
woman
no
matter
what
her
age
may
and
so
in
his
honest
zeal
for
doing
good
and
in
the
happy
conviction
that
he
was
imprisoning
lust
doubt
impiety
and
evil
thoughts
he
turned
his
key
upon
them
and
this
sentiment
which
when
analysed
had
its
share
of
simple
complacency
and
the
secret
jealousy
of
an
ignorant
man
was
not
without
its
beauty
and
purity
also
having
thrust
the
bunch
of
keys
into
his
pocket
again
the
duke
turned
a
satisfied
countenance
to
lerond
overhead
he
said
is
the
king
s
room
the
old
inventories
give
this
name
to
all
the
upper
story
the
room
properly
however
contains
the
bed
in
which
louis
xiii
slept
and
it
is
still
hung
with
the
same
silk
embroidery
it
is
well
worth
a
lerond
was
so
tired
that
he
could
hardly
stand
his
legs
accustomed
all
the
year
round
to
be
tucked
away
under
a
desk
had
had
hard
work
to
carry
him
through
the
walk
on
the
slippery
paths
of
the
park
the
tramp
round
the
stables
and
the
stroll
along
the
woods
to
the
church
they
felt
limp
and
weak
and
his
feet
were
hot
and
painful
for
the
poor
man
anxious
to
do
the
right
thing
had
unfortunately
put
on
boots
casting
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
ceiling
he
stammered
it
grows
late
would
it
not
be
better
to
join
the
ladies
in
the
de
brécé
was
only
adamant
with
regard
to
the
visit
to
the
stables
as
far
as
the
remainder
of
his
property
was
concerned
he
was
reasonable
enough
yes
the
light
is
going
he
said
we
will
see
the
rest
another
time
to
the
right
lerond
to
the
right
what
walls
cried
the
as
he
reached
the
doorway
what
tremendously
thick
walls
his
thin
face
the
calm
and
cold
expression
of
which
had
not
altered
one
whit
at
the
sight
of
the
hunting
trophies
in
the
hall
the
historic
paintings
in
the
the
rich
tapestries
the
magnificent
ceiling
of
the
gallery
and
the
beautiful
books
with
their
tooled
morocco
bindings
now
grew
animated
interested
and
full
of
admiration
he
had
at
last
discovered
something
to
stir
and
amaze
him
something
which
afforded
him
both
food
for
thought
and
mental
satisfaction
a
wall
his
legal
mind
struck
down
in
its
flower
at
the
time
of
the
new
regulations
and
his
heart
too
soon
bereaved
of
the
joy
of
administering
punishment
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
a
wall
a
deaf
dumb
sombre
thing
which
recalled
to
his
eager
mind
thoughts
of
prison
cells
of
sentences
and
public
prosecutions
of
codes
laws
justice
and
morals
a
wall
yes
replied
the
duke
the
wall
at
this
particular
spot
between
the
gallery
and
the
next
wing
is
tremendously
thick
it
is
the
outer
wall
of
the
old
castle
built
in
lerond
gazed
lingeringly
at
the
wall
measured
it
with
his
eyes
felt
it
with
his
little
crooked
yellow
hands
studied
worshipped
loved
and
possessed
it
mesdames
he
said
to
the
ladies
on
his
return
to
the
the
duke
has
very
kindly
shown
me
his
wonderful
library
on
my
way
back
i
noticed
the
remarkable
wall
that
separates
the
gallery
from
the
wing
i
don
t
think
there
is
anything
to
equal
it
even
at
but
neither
the
brécé
ladies
nor
madame
de
courtrai
was
listening
their
united
attention
was
given
to
another
matter
jean
cried
the
duchess
to
her
husband
jean
look
at
this
and
she
pointed
to
a
red
leather
case
lying
on
the
table
near
the
lamp
which
a
servant
had
just
brought
in
the
case
was
round
in
shape
topped
with
a
kind
of
knob
like
a
thimble
and
divided
at
the
base
in
the
shape
of
a
clover
leaf
a
visiting
card
lay
beside
it
all
around
the
table
were
heaps
of
tissue
paper
that
made
one
think
of
little
white
dogs
tied
up
with
pale
blue
ribbon
do
look
jean
the
abbé
guitrel
who
was
standing
near
the
table
opened
the
case
with
reverent
hands
and
displayed
a
golden
ciborium
who
sent
it
asked
de
brécé
look
at
the
card
i
am
horribly
worried
i
don
t
know
what
to
de
brécé
put
on
his
glasses
picked
up
the
card
and
read
aloud
baronne
jules
de
bonmont
for
he
replaced
the
card
upon
the
table
took
off
his
glasses
and
murmured
how
very
annoying
a
ciborium
a
beautiful
ciborium
said
the
abbé
when
i
used
to
sing
in
the
choir
as
a
boy
said
the
general
i
always
heard
the
fathers
call
it
a
yes
you
can
call
it
either
a
custodial
or
a
ciborium
replied
the
abbé
these
are
the
names
given
to
the
receptacles
which
hold
the
reserved
eucharist
but
the
custodial
is
formed
like
a
cylinder
and
has
a
conical
with
frowning
brow
de
brécé
stood
wrapped
in
thought
then
with
a
deep
sigh
he
said
why
should
madame
de
bonmont
who
is
a
jewess
give
a
ciborium
to
why
have
these
people
a
mania
for
forcing
themselves
into
our
churches
the
abbé
guitrel
with
his
fingers
thrust
into
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
moistened
his
lips
and
said
gently
allow
me
to
point
out
monsieur
that
madame
jules
de
bonmont
is
a
nonsense
cried
the
duke
she
is
an
austrian
jewess
and
her
maiden
name
was
wallstein
the
real
name
of
her
late
husband
the
baron
de
bonmont
was
allow
me
monsieur
said
the
abbé
i
do
not
deny
that
the
baronne
de
bonmont
is
of
jewish
descent
what
i
mean
is
that
she
has
been
converted
and
baptized
and
is
therefore
a
christian
she
is
a
good
christian
i
might
add
and
gives
largely
to
our
charities
in
fact
she
is
an
example
to
i
am
acquainted
with
your
ideas
interrupted
the
duke
and
i
respect
them
as
i
respect
your
cloth
but
to
me
a
converted
jew
remains
a
jew
i
can
not
make
any
distinction
between
the
neither
can
i
said
madame
de
brécé
to
a
certain
extent
your
feelings
are
legitimate
madame
la
duchesse
replied
the
abbé
but
you
can
not
be
unaware
of
the
teaching
of
the
church
that
the
curse
pronounced
against
the
jews
was
inspired
by
their
crime
and
not
their
race
and
that
therefore
the
attendant
results
can
not
affect
them
if
it
heavy
said
the
duke
lifting
the
ciborium
from
its
case
and
holding
it
out
i
am
most
annoyed
said
the
duchess
it
is
heavy
repeated
the
duke
and
what
is
more
added
the
abbé
it
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
and
possesses
the
refined
characteristics
which
are
so
to
speak
the
seal
and
stamp
of
the
work
of
rondonneau
the
younger
none
but
the
archbishop
s
goldsmith
could
have
displayed
such
judgment
in
the
selection
of
a
model
from
traditional
christian
art
or
have
reproduced
the
shape
and
decoration
with
such
skill
and
fidelity
this
ciborium
is
a
work
of
the
highest
merit
and
is
in
the
style
of
the
thirteenth
the
bowl
and
cover
are
in
solid
gold
said
de
brécé
according
to
liturgical
regulations
the
bowl
of
the
ciborium
must
be
of
gold
or
at
any
rate
of
silver
gilded
inside
said
the
abbé
de
brécé
who
was
holding
it
upside
down
remarked
the
foot
is
that
s
a
good
thing
cried
the
duchess
the
abbé
guitrel
looked
lovingly
at
the
work
of
rondonneau
the
younger
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
he
said
it
is
thirteenth
century
and
a
better
period
could
not
have
been
selected
the
thirteenth
century
is
the
golden
age
of
this
particular
kind
of
work
at
that
epoch
the
ciborium
was
made
in
the
beautiful
shape
of
a
pomegranate
which
you
recognize
in
this
delicious
example
the
firm
strong
foot
is
further
enriched
with
enamels
and
inset
with
precious
mercy
upon
us
precious
stones
cried
the
duchess
figures
of
angels
and
prophets
are
finely
chased
on
the
panels
giving
the
most
delightful
effect
to
the
that
bonmont
was
a
rogue
said
madame
de
courtrai
suddenly
he
was
a
thief
and
his
widow
has
not
yet
made
you
see
that
she
is
beginning
to
do
so
however
said
the
duke
pointing
to
the
shining
ciborium
what
shall
we
do
asked
the
duchess
we
can
not
return
her
gift
said
the
duke
why
not
asked
his
mother
well
mother
because
it
is
then
we
ve
got
to
keep
it
asked
the
duchess
well
yes
i
suppose
and
thank
her
what
else
can
we
do
don
t
you
agree
with
me
general
it
would
have
been
fitter
said
the
general
if
this
lady
who
is
a
stranger
to
you
had
refrained
from
making
you
a
present
but
there
is
no
reason
to
respond
to
her
civility
with
an
taking
the
ciborium
in
his
venerable
hands
the
abbé
guitrel
said
will
i
feel
sure
look
with
kindness
upon
this
gift
presented
by
a
pious
soul
to
the
tabernacle
of
her
but
hang
it
all
put
in
the
duke
i
am
in
this
case
if
madame
de
bonmont
and
young
bonmont
want
to
be
invited
to
my
house
and
they
certainly
will
want
to
i
shall
be
obliged
to
receive
them
chapter
iii
in
their
efforts
to
escape
the
sudden
shower
that
had
overtaken
them
outside
the
ramparts
of
the
castle
madame
jules
de
bonmont
and
madame
hortha
ran
along
the
sentry
path
up
to
the
gate
house
upon
the
debased
vault
of
which
could
be
seen
the
peacock
emblem
of
the
extinct
house
of
paves
de
terremondre
and
baron
wallstein
soon
caught
them
up
and
the
four
of
them
stood
still
trying
to
regain
their
breath
where
is
the
abbé
asked
madame
de
bonmont
arthur
did
you
leave
the
abbé
sheltering
by
the
hedge
baron
wallstein
told
his
sister
that
the
abbé
was
coming
along
behind
them
and
soon
they
saw
the
abbé
guitrel
walking
up
the
stone
steps
damp
but
cheerful
he
alone
had
managed
to
display
a
perfect
dignity
at
the
sudden
alarm
and
had
preserved
the
calm
suitable
to
his
years
and
his
corpulence
he
had
in
fact
maintained
a
truly
episcopal
solemnity
the
race
had
deepened
the
roses
in
madame
de
bonmont
s
cheeks
her
full
bosom
rose
and
fell
under
her
light
blouse
as
she
stood
drawing
her
skirts
tightly
around
her
plump
hips
in
her
rich
maturity
with
her
disordered
hair
lustrous
eyes
and
ripe
lips
a

at
this
time
baron
jules
de

son
of
nathan
son
of
seligmann
son
of
simon
came
over
from
austria
where
he
had
negotiated
the
loans
during
the
dark
days
of
the
empire
he
now
made
france
the
headquarters
of
his
financial
operations
bringing
to
the
republic
the
benefit
of
his
financial
genius
a
member
of
parliament
who
at
that
time
represented
the
district
of
montil
became
one
of
the
first
and
surest
of
his
friends
and
allies
he
discovered
that
the
era
of
ideas
and
strife
having
gone
by
the
time
had
come
for
big
business
deals
he
bestowed
upon
the
baron
his
warmest
sympathy
and
his
extremely
useful
devotion
and
the
baron
on
his
side
was
always
ready
to
commend
as
a
clever
fellow
it
was
by
the
advice
of
that
baron
jules
bought
the
château
of
montil
it
was
then
a
dignified
and
beautiful
ruin
well
worth
restoring
and
preserving
the
task
of
its
restoration
was
confided
to
a
pupil
of
quatrebarbe
the
diocesan
architect
he
removed
all
the
old
stone
and
replaced
it
with
new
in
the
new
building
the
baron
who
astonished
his
political
friends
by
his
taste
in
art
promptly
installed
his
collection
of
pictures
furniture
and
armoury
all
of
which
were
of
enormous
value
and
thus
the
château
of
montil
to
use
the
words
of
de
terremondre
was
preserved
to
the
lovers
of
our
national
art
and
transformed
into
a
marvellous
museum
by
the
care
and
generosity
of
a
great
seignior
who
at
the
same
time
was
a
great
the
baron
was
not
long
permitted
to
enjoy
the
proud
possession
of
montil
with
its
towers
ornamented
with
medallions
its
tracery
staircase
and
the
delicately
carved
woodwork
of
its
interior
after
reaching
the
zenith
of
his
financial
prosperity
he
died
suddenly
of
an
attack
of
apoplexy
just
on
the
eve
of
all
the
ruin
and
scandal
that
followed
he
died
in
possession
of
all
his
wealth
leaving
behind
him
a
gay
young
widow
and
a
boy
who
with
his
short
squat
figure
lowering
brows
and
already
pitiless
heart
closely
resembled
his
father
madame
de
bonmont
had
kept
montil
of
which
she
was
very
fond
she
led
madame
hortha
to
the
spiral
staircase
the
interlacing
stonework
of
which
repeated
interminably
in
its
intertwinings
the
emblematic
peacock
of
bernard
de
paves
tied
by
the
foot
to
the
lute
of
nicolette
de
vaucelles
then
picking
up
her
skirts
with
a
sudden
abrupt
gesture
not
without
a
charm
of
its
own
she
followed
her
de
terremondre
president
of
the
archæological
society
and
formerly
a
great
came
closely
behind
her
with
an
eye
upon
the
rhythmic
movement
of
her
engaging
figure
at
the
age
of
forty
she
had
retained
the
wish
and
the
capacity
to
please
and
de
terremondre
thoroughly
appreciated
this
for
he
was
a
susceptible
man
yet
he
did
not
attempt
to
make
love
to
her
knowing
that
she
herself
was
greatly
infatuated
with
raoul
marcien
a
handsome
choleric
man
who
had
fallen
into
disrepute
let
us
go
into
the
armoury
said
madame
de
bonmont
pushing
open
the
door
it
is
warmed
with
it
was
true
that
the
armoury
was
so
heated
amidst
the
grotesque
encaustic
tiles
of
quatrebarbe
designed
after
the
manner
of
the
old
paving
he
had
torn
up
the
gratings
opened
their
bright
brazen
mouths
madame
de
bonmont
was
careful
to
invite
the
abbé
guitrel
to
a
seat
near
one
of
the
radiators
and
to
ask
him
if
his
feet
were
damp
and
whether
he
would
not
have
a
glass
of
something
hot
under
the
ribbed
vault
of
its
roof
the
huge
room
glittered
with
a
display
of
iron
and
steel
such
as
not
even
the
armeria
in
madrid
could
boast
one
or
two
of
the
financier

brilliant
business
coups
had
resulted
in

all
collected
by
the

and
displayed
in
this
room
after
dinner
while
pouring
out
the
coffee
madame
de
bonmont
offered
no
sugar
to
the
abbé
who
always
took
it
and
gave
it
to
baron
wallstein
who
suffered
from
diabetes
and
had
to
be
very
careful
in
his
diet
she
did
not
do
this
with
any
malice
aforethought
but
her
mind
was
full
of
other
matters
that
engaged
her
undivided
attention
her
depression
which
simple
soul
that
she
was
she
was
incapable
of
hiding
was
caused
by
a
telegram
from
paris
worded
with
a
twofold
meaning
one
literal
and
commonplace
obvious
to
all
referring
to
a
delay
in
forwarding
some
plants
the
other
the
real
and
ingenious
one
understood
to
her
unhappiness
by
herself
alone
indicated
that
her
lover
could
not
come
to
montil
but
was
in
dire
straits
and
forced
to
remain
in
paris
it
was
nothing
new
for
raoul
marcien
to
be
in
need
of
money
since
he
attained
his
majority
fifteen
years
previously
he
had
just
managed
to
keep
himself
going
by
a
series
of
bold
and
clever
but
this
year
his
difficulties
which
had
continued
to
increase
and
multiply
were
positively
appalling
madame
de
bonmont
was
nearly
always
worried
and
depressed
about
him
and
his
affairs
for
she
loved
him
truly
and
tenderly
with
all
her
soul
and
with
all
her
body
two
lumps
for
you
de
terremondre
yes
she
adored
her
raoul
her
rara
with
all
the
strength
of
her
placid
soul
she
would
have
liked
him
to
be
loving
and
faithful
and
studious
he
was
not
what
she
wished
him
to
be
and
in
her
grief
and
fear
of
losing
him
she
regularly
burned
candles
for
his
benefit
in
the
church
of
de
terremondre
who
was
by
way
of
being
a
connoisseur
examined
the
pictures
they
were
all
modern
works
of
art
paintings
by
daubigny
theodore
rousseau
jules
dupré
chintreuil
diaz
and
corot
and
consisted
of
pools
bordered
by
deep
woods
meadows
village
streets
forest
glades
bathed
in
the
golden
light
of
the
setting
sun
and
willows
emerging
from
the
silver
mists
of
morning
the
prevailing
tones
were
white
fawn
green
blue
and
grey
in
massive
gilt
frames
they
stood
out
against
the
crimson
damask
hangings
that
accorded
ill
with
the
gigantic
renaissance
with
the
loves
of
the
nymphs
and
the
metamorphoses
of
the
gods
sculptured
in
the
stone
the
pictures
undoubtedly
marred
the
effect
of
the
wonderful
old
ceiling
the
painted
compartments
of
which
reproduced
in
infinite
variety
the
peacock
of
bernard
de
paves
tied
by
the
foot
to
the
lute
of
nicolette
de
vaucelles
that
s
a
fine
millet
said
de
terremondre
coming
to
a
standstill
before
a
goosegirl
whose
figure
stood
out
terrible
in
its
rustic
solemnity
against
a
background
of
pale
gold
it
s
a
pretty
picture
answered
baron
wallstein
i
have
the
same
thing
at
my
house
in
vienna
but
mine
is
a
shepherd
not
a
goosegirl
i
don
t
know
what
my
brother
gave
for
this
cup
in
hand
he
began
to
stroll
round
the
gallery
this
jules
dupré
cost
my
francs
this
theodore
rousseau
and
this
corot
i
am
acquainted
with
the
views
of
the
late
baron
in
regard
to
pictures
replied
de
terremondre
following
the
baron
round
the
room
one
day
he
met
me
going
down
the
staircase
of
the
hôtel
des
ventes
with
a
little
picture
under
my
arm
he
caught
hold
of
my
sleeve
as
he
was
fond
of
doing
and
said
what
are
you
carrying
off
there
with
the
satisfied
pride
of
the
complacent
dabbler
in
art
i
replied
a
ruisdael
de
bonmont
a
genuine
ruisdael
it
has
been
engraved
and
i
happen
to
have
a
print
in
my
what
did
you
give
for
your
ruisdael
the
sale
was
in
a
dark
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
dealer
did
not
know
what
he
was
selling
thirty
francs
what
a
pity
what
a
pity
he
ejaculated
and
seeing
my
surprise
gave
another
tug
at
my
sleeve
my
dear
de
terremondre
you
ought
to
have
given
francs
for
it
if
you
had
paid
as
much
as
that
it
would
have
been
worth
francs
to
you
the
little
picture
only
cost
you
thirty
francs
and
will
never
fetch
a
high
price
say
louis
at
the
most
the
value
of
a
thing
can
not
rise
at
a
jump
from
thirty
francs
to
ah
concluded
de
terremondre
the
baron
was
a
clever
man
he
was
indeed
replied
wallstein
and
he
also
liked
taking
a
rise
out
of
the
two
cronies
looked
up
and
saw
right
before
their
eyes
the
very
baron
they
had
been
discussing
the
man
who
had
been
so
clever
all
his
life
there
he
was
painted
by
delaunay
amongst
a
lot
of
costly
pictures
his
cunning
face
leering
out
of
a
glittering
frame
madame
de
bonmont
and
the
abbé
seated
together
in
the
huge
chimney
corner
before
the
fire
were
chatting
about
the
weather
and
madame
de
bonmont
was
thinking
how
sweet
life
might
be
if
only
rara
willed
it
so
she
loved
him
so
simply
and
so
ingenuously
all
the
ancient
and
modern
moralists
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
the
doctors
and
theologians
the
abbé
guitrel
and
monseigneur
charlot
the
pope
and
the
whole
of
the
church
council
the
archangel
michael
with
his
great
trumpet
and
christ
come
again
in
his
glory
to
judge
both
the
quick
and
the
dead
all
of
them
put
together
would
never
have
succeeded
in
making
her
believe
that
it
was
a
sin
for
her
to
love
rara
she
was
thinking
that
she
would
not
see
him
at
montil
and
that
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
he
was
unfaithful
to
her
she
knew
he
was
almost
as
familiar
with
women
as
he
was
with
the
bailiffs
she
had
seen
him
at
the
races
with
ladies
of
easy
virtue
and
uncertain
age
at
whom
he
had
cast
leering
glances
as
he
handed
them
the
or
helped
them
on
with
their
cloaks
the
poor
dear
could
not
get
rid
of
a
whole
host
of
tiresome
people
to
whom
he
was
bound
for
reasons
she
found
it
impossible
to
understand
even
when
he
explained
them
at
length
she
felt
very
unhappy
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
the
abbé
was
thinking
of
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
his
rival
the
abbé
lantaigne
was
done
for
he
was
going
under
in
the
ruin
of
his
seminary
smothered
beneath
bills
of
the
butcher
lafolie
but
there
were
many
rivals
in
the
field
a
senior
curate
from
paris
and
a
curé
from
lyons
seemed
to
be
the
government
favourites
the
nunciature
as
usual
lay
low
the
abbé
guitrel
heaved
a
sigh
hearing
the
sigh
madame
de
bonmont
who
was
very
reproached
herself
for
selfishly
thinking
of
her
own
affairs
she
made
an
effort
to
appear
interested
in
the
abbé
guitrel
s
concerns
and
affectionately
inquired
whether
he
would
not
soon
be
made
a
bishop
you
are
a
candidate
for
tourcoing
she
said
would
you
not
dislike
living
in
so
small
a
town
the
abbé
declared
that
the
care
of
his
flock
would
be
sufficient
to
occupy
him
and
that
moreover
the
diocese
of
tourcoing
was
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
important
in
northern
france
it
is
the
see
he
added
of
the
blessed
loup
the
apostle
of
indeed
remarked
madame
de
bonmont
we
must
be
careful
went
on
the
abbé
not
to
confound
loup
the
apostle
of
flanders
with
loup
bishop
of
lyons
leu
or
loup
bishop
of
sens
and
loup
bishop
of
troyes
the
latter
had
been
married
seven
years
to
pimentola
a
sister
of
the
bishop
of
arles
when
he
left
her
to
retire
in
solitude
to
lerins
and
devote
himself
entirely
to
works
of
ascetic
and
madame
de
bonmont
was
thinking
he
s
been
losing
heavily
again
in
one
way
it
is
good
for
him
because
he
has
been
winning
too
frequently
at
the
club
lately
and
people
were
getting
suspicious
on
the
other
hand
it
s
a
great
nuisance
i
shall
have
to
pay
and
madame
de
bonmont
was
much
annoyed
at
having
to
pay
rara
s
debts
in
the
first
place
she
never
liked
paying
and
in
the
second
she
disliked
lending
money
to
rara
as
much
as
a
matter
of
principle
as
from
fear
of
not
being
loved
for
herself
alone
at
the
same
time
she
knew
that
when
she
saw
her
rara
gloomy
and
terrible
tying
a
wet
towel
round
his
fevered
cranium
which
was
beginning
to
be
discernible
through
the
hair
and
when
she
heard
the
poor
darling
crying
amidst
a
torrent
of
blasphemies
that
the
only
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
blow
out
his
brains
she
knew
she
would
have
to
pay
you
see
rara
was
a
man
of
honour
in
fact
he
lived
on
honour
since
he
had
left
the
army
his
profession
had
been
that
of
witness
or
umpire
and
in
the
smartest
circles
no
duel
ever
took
place
without
his
presence
and
to
think
that
she
would
have
to
part
with
more
money
if
only
he
belonged
entirely
to
her
and
was
loving
and
attentive
as
it
was
he
was
in
a
perpetual
state
of
agitation
desperation
and
fury
and
always
seemed
like
a
man
laying
about
him
in
the
thick
of
a
fight
the
saint
of
whom
i
am
speaking
madame
la
baronne
went
on
the
abbé
the
blessed
loup
or
lupus
preached
the
gospel
in
flanders
and
his
apostolic
labours
were
often
fraught
with
many
trials
in
his
biography
we
find
an
instance
which
will
touch
you
by
its
naïve
beauty
one
frosty
day
in
winter
he
was
traversing
the
frozen
countryside
and
stopped
at
the
house
of
a
senator
to
warm
himself
the
latter
who
was
entertaining
some
of
his
boon
companions
continued
to
hold
unseemly
conversation
with
them
in
the
presence
of
the
apostle
loup
made
an
attempt
to
stop
the
conversation
my
sons
said
he
to
the
senator
and
his
guests
are
you
not
aware
that
on
the
day
of
judgment
you
will
have
to
answer
for
every
vain
speech
you
have
uttered
treating
the
exhortations
of
the
holy
man
with
contempt
however
they
returned
with
redoubled
zest
to
their
indecent
and
impious
talk
shaking
the
dust
from
off
his
feet
the
blessed
saint
said
to
them
i
desired
to
warm
my
tired
body
against
the
bitter
cold
but
your
sinful
talk
forces
me
though
still
numb
with
cold
to
quit
your
madame
de
bonmont
was
sadly
reflecting
that
lately
with
teeth
set
and
eyes
flashing
rara
had
been
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
jews
he
had
always
been
against
the
jews
and
so
had
she
for
that
matter
however
she
preferred
not
to
discuss
the
subject
and
in
her
opinion
rara
being
the
lover
of
a
catholic
lady
of
jewish
origin
was
wanting
in
tact
when
he
swore
as
he
invariably
did
that
he
would
like
to
rip
open
every
sheeny
in
christendom
she
would
have
preferred
more
gentleness
and
sympathy
calmer
views
and
more
amiable
desires
as
for
herself
her
thoughts
of
love
were
mingled
with
innocent
dreams
of
sweetmeats
and
poetry
the
mission
of
the
blessed
loup
continued
the
abbé
guitrel
bore
fruit
the
inhabitants
of
tourcoing
were
baptized
by
him
and
chose
him
by
acclamation
for
their
bishop
his
end
was
accompanied
by
circumstances
which
i
feel
sure
will
impress
you
madame
one
december
day
in
the
year
of
our
lord
loup
then
full
of
years
and
good
deeds
made
his
way
to
a
tree
surrounded
by
briars
where
it
was
his
habit
to
pray
fixing
two
stakes
into
the
ground
he
marked
out
a
space
as
long
as
his
body
and
said
to
the
disciples
he
had
asked
to
accompany
him
when
by
god
s
will
i
end
my
exile
in
this
world
it
is
there
i
desire
to
be
st
loup
died
on
the
sunday
following
the
day
on
which
he
had
marked
out
his
last
and
it
was
done
as
he
had
commanded
blandus
came
to
inter
the
body
of
the
blessed
saint
whom
he
was
afterwards
to
succeed
as
bishop
of
she
felt
sad
and
full
of
compassion
she
understood
the
reason
for
rara
s
frenzies
and
excused
them
the
fact
was
that
latterly
to
his
reputation
among
his
fellows
as
a
man
of
honour
rara
had
warmly
espoused
the
cause
of
the
army
in
which
he
had
formerly
served
as
a
cavalry
officer
he
had
greatly
tightened
the
bonds
that
united
him
with
one
great
family
the
army
and
had
even
struck
a
jew
whom
he
had
overheard
in
a
café
asking
for
the
army
list
madame
de
bonmont
loved
and
admired
him
but
she
was
far
from
happy
raising
her
head
and
opening
her
eyes
she
said
the
see
of
the
blessed
loup
apostle
to
please
go
on
l
abbé
i
am
very
it
was
madame
de
bonmont
s
fate
to
seek
in
hearts
little
fitted
to
give
it
her
the
sweetness
of
peaceful
love
the
sentimental
elizabeth
had
always
bestowed
her
heart
upon
arrant
adventurers
during
her
husband
s
lifetime
she
had
fondly
loved
the
son
of
an
obscure
senator
young
x
famous
for
having
appropriated
to
his
own
use
a
whole
year
s
secret
funds
of
a
certain
government
department
close
upon
this
she
had
given
her
confidence
to
an
extremely
fascinating
man
who
was
one
of
the
bright
particular
stars
of
the
government
press
and
who
suddenly
disappeared
from
view
in
a
tremendous
financial
catastrophe
these
two
at
any
rate
had
been
introduced
to
her
by
the
baron
himself
you
can
not
blame
a
woman
if
she
has
lovers
belonging
to
her
own
set
but
her
newest
dearest
her
one
and
only
love
raoul
marcien
had
not
been
one
of
the
baron
s
friends
he
did
not
belong
to
the
world
of
sale
and
barter
she
had
met
him
in
a
most
select
circle
of
catholic
royalist
society
somewhere
in
the
provinces
he
was
himself
as
good
as
a
nobleman
this
time
she
had
firmly
believed
she
was
going
to
satisfy
her
desire
for
love
and
delicate
refined
intimacy
that
at
last
she
had
found
the
chivalrous
lover
with
noble
and
beautiful
feelings
of
whom
she
had
so
long
dreamed
and
now
she
found
that
he
was
like
all
the
others
alternately
frozen
with
fear
and
burning
with
rage
torn
with
anguish
of
mind
and
agitated
by
the
extraordinary
adventures
of
a
life
devoted
to
fraud
and
blackmail
but
he
was
so
much
more
picturesque
and
amusing
than
anyone
else
he
would
for
instance
be
summoned
as
witness
in
some
serious
and
delicate
affair
and
at
the
same
time
be
served
with
a
at
his
club
or
again
he
might
one
day
be
made
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
the
same
morning
be
haled
before
the
court
on
a
charge
of
embezzlement
moreover
with
erect
carriage
and
moustache
he
defended
his
honour
at
the
point
of
his
sword
but
for
some
months
past
he
had
seemed
to
be
losing
his
he
spoke
too
loudly
and
gesticulated
too
much
in
fact
he
compromised
his
case
by
his
desire
for
vengeance
for
he
was
always
complaining
of
betrayal
it
was
with
real
anxiety
that
elizabeth
saw
rara
s
temper
grow
daily
more
unmanageable
when
she
went
to
see
him
of
a
morning
she
would
find
him
in
his
bending
over
his
old
military
trunk
crammed
full
of
writs
swearing
and
blaspheming
with
crimson
face
rogues
scoundrels
scum
wretches
he
would
shout
vociferating
that
they
should
hear
from
him
to
their
cost
she
would
snatch
a
kiss
in
the
middle
of
the
curses
and
be
sent
away
with
the
usual
remark
that
he
would
blow
out
his
brains
no
it
was
not
the
love
of
which
elizabeth
had
dreamed
you
were
saying
l
abbé
that
the
blessed
loup
but
the
abbé
with
his
head
inclined
at
a
gentle
angle
and
hands
clasped
upon
his
portly
frame
was
fast
asleep
in
his
chair
so
madame
de
bonmont
who
was
as
kind
to
herself
as
she
was
to
others
also
fell
asleep
in
her
easy
chair
fell
asleep
thinking
that
perhaps
after
all
rara
would
come
to
an
end
of
his
worries
soon
that
she
might
only
have
to
give
him
quite
a
little
money
and
that
after
all
she
was
beloved
by
the
handsomest
of
men
my
dear
my
dear
cried
the
madame
hortha
in
her
voice
calculated
to
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
a
turk
are
we
not
to
see
ernest
standing
there
with
her
big
limbs
and
heavy
features
she
looked
like
a
warrior
virgin
left
behind
and
forgotten
for
twenty
years
in
the
wings
of
the
theatre
at
bayreuth
she
was
terrible
to
look
upon
clothed
and
girdled
with
jet
and
steel
that
flashed
gleamed
and
clanked
as
she
moved
but
in
spite
of
it
all
quite
a
good
sort
of
woman
and
the
mother
of
numerous
children
awakened
with
a
start
by
the
magic
blast
that
blared
from
the
bosom
of
the
excellent
madame
hortha
the
baronne
replied
that
her
son
who
had
obtained
sick
leave
was
to
arrive
that
evening
at
montil
and
the
carriage
had
gone
to
the
station
to
meet
him
the
abbé
guitrel
whose
slumbers
too
had
been
pierced
by
this
nocturnal
flourish
of
trumpets
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
moistening
his
lips
that
they
might
have
the
necessary
unction
murmured
with
heavenly
sweetness
yes
loup
and
so
said
madame
de
bonmont
you
will
wear
the
mitre
you
will
hold
the
crosier
and
have
a
big
ring
on
your
i
do
not
know
yet
madame
replied
guitrel
yes
yes
you
will
be
appointed
she
leaned
forward
slightly
and
in
a
low
voice
asked
monsieur
l
abbé
must
the
bishop
s
ring
be
of
any
particular
design
not
exactly
madame
replied
guitrel
the
bishop
wears
the
ring
as
a
symbol
of
his
spiritual
union
with
the
church
it
is
therefore
fitting
that
the
ring
should
suggest
by
its
appearance
thoughts
of
austerity
and
ah
said
madame
de
bonmont
what
about
the
stone
in
the
middle
ages
replied
the
abbé
the
bezel
was
sometimes
of
gold
like
the
ring
and
sometimes
consisted
of
a
precious
stone
it
seems
that
the
amethyst
is
a
very
suitable
stone
with
which
to
adorn
the
pastoral
ring
it
gleams
with
a
gentle
lustre
and
is
one
of
the
twelve
stones
that
formed
the
breastplate
worn
by
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
in
christian
symbolism
it
stands
for
modesty
and
humility
narbode
bishop
of
rennes
in
the
eleventh
century
makes
it
the
emblem
of
those
who
give
themselves
to
be
crucified
on
the
cross
of
jesus
indeed
said
madame
de
bonmont
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
when
guitrel
became
bishop
of
tourcoing
she
would
make
him
a
present
of
an
episcopal
ring
set
with
a
large
amethyst
madame
hortha
s
trumpets
again
rang
out
my
dear
my
dear
are
we
not
to
see
raoul
marcien
are
we
not
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
dear
man
the
cosmopolitan
lady
was
well
worthy
of
admiration
in
that
although
acquainted
with
every
grade
of
society
under
the
sun
she
avoided
making
a
hopeless
muddle
of
them
all
her
brain
was
a
directory
of
all
the
of
all
the
capitals
of
europe
and
she
was
not
wanting
in
a
certain
worldly
judgment
her
kindness
of
heart
too
was
universal
if
she
had
mentioned
raoul
marcien
it
was
in
all
innocence
she
was
innocence
personified
and
knew
nothing
of
evil
she
was
a
good
wife
and
a
good
mother
whose
home
was
a
or
a
yet
a
domesticated
woman
for
all
that
under
the
corsage
of
jet
and
steel
that
glittered
as
she
moved
with
a
sound
as
of
hail
she
wore
coarse
grey
cotton
stays
even
her
lady
never
questioned
her
virtue
my
dear
my
dear
of
course
you
know
that
raoul
marcien
has
fought
a
duel
with
isidore
mayer
and
in
a
voice
that
made
one
think
of
international
bureaux
and
tourist
inquiry
offices
she
related
the
story
which
madame
de
bonmont
knew
by
heart
she
told
how
isidore
mayer
a
jew
both
well
known
and
highly
respected
in
the
financial
world
went
into
a
café
in
the
boulevard
des
capucines
sat
down
at
a
table
and
asked
for
the
army
list
having
a
son
in
the
army
he
wished
to
make
sure
of
the
names
of
the
officers
in
his
regiment
just
as
he
was
about
to
take
the
book
from
a
waiter
raoul
marcien
strode
up
and
said
monsieur
i
forbid
you
to
lay
a
hand
on
that
book
it
is
sacred
to
the
french
army
why
asked
isidore
mayer
because
you
are
of
the
same
religion
as
the
traitor
isidore
mayer
shrugged
his
shoulders
upon
which
raoul
marcien
struck
him
full
in
the
face
an
encounter
was
arranged
and
two
shots
fired
without
effect
my
dear
my
dear
do
you
understand
why
he
did
it
i
must
say
i
do
madame
de
bonmont
did
not
reply
and
her
silence
was
prolonged
by
that
of
de
terremondre
and
baron
wallstein
i
believe
said
madame
de
bonmont
listening
intently
to
the
distant
sounds
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
rumble
of
wheels
that
ernest
is
at
this
point
a
servant
came
in
with
the
newspapers
de
terremondre
took
one
of
them
and
glanced
casually
at
it
still
the
affair
he
murmured
more
professors
protesting
why
will
they
insist
on
meddling
with
what
does
not
concern
them
it
is
only
right
that
the
army
should
settle
its
own
affairs
as
it
always
has
done
moreover
it
seems
to
me
that
when
seven
officers
of
course
replied
the
abbé
when
seven
officers
have
given
judgment
i
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
unseemly
to
raise
any
doubts
as
to
their
decision
it
is
highly
indecorous
and
incongruous
are
you
speaking
of
the
affair
asked
madame
de
bonmont
well
i
can
assure
you
that
dreyfus
is
guilty
i
have
it
from
an
authentic
she
blushed
as
she
spoke
for
it
was
raoul
to
whom
she
had
referred
ernest
entered
the
sulky
and
morose
good
evening
mother
good
evening
l
abbé
he
took
very
little
notice
of
the
others
but
threw
himself
upon
the
cushions
of
a
couch
which
stood
just
beneath
the
portrait
of
his
father
whom
he
much
resembled
he
was
the
baron
over
again
but
shrunken
diminished
and
sickly
the
wild
boar
grown
small
pale
and
flabby
the
likeness
however
was
striking
and
de
terremondre
drew
attention
to
it
it
is
surprising
de
bonmont
how
like
you
are
to
the
portrait
of
the
late
baron
your
ernest
lifted
his
head
and
glanced
at
the
picture
by
delaunay
ah
yes
the
pater
clever
chap
the
pater
i
m
all
there
myself
too
but
pretty
well
played
out
how
are
you
l
abbé
you
and
i
are
good
friends
aren
t
we
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
then
turning
to
de
terremondre
who
was
still
holding
the
newspaper
what
do
they
say
there
as
far
as
we
fellows
are
concerned
we
are
not
allowed
an
opinion
of
any
description
you
bet
only
a
bourgeois
is
permitted
the
luxury
of
an
idea
though
it
may
be
an
idiotic
one
then
good
lord
the
things
that
interest
the
big
bugs
how
should
they
interest
us
he
sneered
his
life
in
the
regiment
afforded
him
endless
amusement
although
he
did
not
appear
so
he
was
exceedingly
shrewd
prudent
and
cunning
he
also
knew
when
to
hold
his
tongue
and
took
the
keenest
delight
in
the
great
and
demoralizing
power
he
possessed
in
spite
of
himself
he
corrupted
every
one
that
he
approached
and
was
extremely
pleased
when
he
could
swindle
them
in
some
way
as
for
instance
when
he
succeeded
in
prevailing
upon
a
poor
and
vain
companion
to
present
him
with
a
meerschaum
pipe
his
greatest
joy
was
to
despise
and
hate
his
superiors
and
to
see
how
some
of
the
more
covetous
among
them
would
absolutely
sell
him
their
very
souls
while
others
more
timorous
and
fearful
of
compromising
themselves
by
showing
him
any
leniency
would
deny
him
not
a
favour
even
but
the
enjoyment
of
some
right
which
they
would
never
refuse
to
the
son
of
a
peasant
full
of
craft
and
cunning
young
ernest
de
bonmont
came
and
sat
by
the
abbé
guitrel
and
began
to
talk
coaxingly
to
him
m
l
abbé
you
often
see
the
brécés
don
t
you
you
know
them
very
well
you
must
not
imagine
my
son
replied
the
abbé
that
i
am
an
intimate
friend
of
the
duc
de
brécé
that
is
not
the
case
the
utmost
i
can
say
is
that
i
often
have
the
privilege
of
visiting
in
the
family
circle
on
certain
festival
days
i
say
mass
in
the
chapel
of
which
as
you
know
is
situated
in
the
woods
of
brécé
this
as
i
was
just
telling
your
mother
is
a
source
of
consolation
and
thankfulness
to
me
after
mass
i
lunch
either
at
the
presbytery
with
le
curé
traviès
or
at
the
château
where
i
am
bound
to
say
they
treat
me
with
the
greatest
kindness
the
duke
s
manner
towards
me
is
always
simple
and
natural
and
the
ladies
are
amiable
and
pleasant
they
do
a
great
deal
of
good
around
here
and
would
do
still
more
were
it
not
for
the
unjustified
prejudices
blind
hatred
and
bitter
feelings
of
the
do
you
happen
to
know
what
effect
was
produced
by
the
utensil
mother
sent
to
the
duchess
for
the
chapel
of
what
utensil
do
you
mean
do
you
refer
to
the
golden
ciborium
i
can
assure
you
that
and
madame
de
brécé
were
much
touched
by
your
mother
s
simple
act
of
homage
to
the
miraculous
so
it
was
a
good
idea
wasn
t
it
l
abbé
well
it
was
my
notion
mother
isn
t
particularly
bright
in
the
way
of
ideas
you
know
oh
i
m
not
reproaching
her
however
let
us
talk
seriously
you
are
very
fond
of
me
are
you
not
l
abbé
guitrel
took
young
bonmont
s
hands
in
both
his
never
doubt
my
affection
for
you
my
son
it
is
the
love
of
a
father
for
his
child
i
might
even
say
that
it
is
a
maternal
love
as
well
and
thus
express
more
fully
all
that
it
contains
both
of
strength
and
tenderness
i
have
watched
you
grow
up
my
dear
ernest
since
that
day
on
which
you
made
so
excellent
a
first
communion
to
this
moment
in
which
you
are
accomplishing
your
noble
duty
as
a
soldier
in
our
great
french
army
which
day
by
day
i
am
thankful
to
say
grows
more
christian
and
more
pious
and
it
is
my
firm
conviction
my
dearest
boy
that
amid
the
distractions
the
errors
even
of
your
age
you
have
kept
the
faith
your
actions
speak
for
themselves
i
know
you
have
always
looked
upon
it
as
your
duty
to
contribute
towards
our
works
of
charity
you
are
my
favourite
well
then
l
abbé
do
your
child
a
good
turn
tell
the
duc
de
brécé
to
give
me
permission
to
wear
the
brécé
hunt
the
hunt
badge
but
my
son
what
do
i
know
of
such
matters
i
am
not
like
de
traviès
a
great
hunter
before
the
lord
i
have
followed
thomas
far
more
than
hubert
the
hunt
badge
is
that
not
a
figurative
expression
a
kind
of
metaphor
to
express
the
idea
of
membership
of
the
hunt
anyway
my
son
what
you
desire
is
an
invitation
to
the
brécé
young
bonmont
gave
a
jump
don
t
for
heaven
s
sake
get
mixed
l
abbé
that
s
not
it
oh
not
a
bit
of
it
an
invitation
i
m
pretty
sure
to
get
an
invitation
to
the
de
brécé
meets
in
exchange
for
the
ciborium
ciborium
remember
the
latin
i
also
think
my
dear
child
that
the
duke
and
duchess
will
make
a
special
point
of
sending
you
an
invitation
as
soon
as
they
realize
that
it
will
please
you
and
your
mother
to
accept
i
believe
you
as
soon
as
they
stuck
to
the
plate
but
you
can
tell
them
from
me
that
i
don
t
care
a
flip
for
an
invitation
to
see
a
meet
i
don
t
want
to
stay
and
rot
at
some
crossroads
where
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
where
you
are
sure
to
get
all
the
mud
kicked
up
by
the
horses
full
in
your
face
and
then
be
sworn
at
by
a
huntsman
for
obstructing
the
way
no
i
am
not
particularly
keen
on
such
amusements
the
brécés
can
keep
their
invitation
in
that
case
my
son
i
do
not
understand
your
and
yet
my
idea
is
clear
enough
l
abbé
i
do
not
intend
the
brécés
to
laugh
up
their
sleeve
at
me
that
s
what
i
m
driving
pray
explain
yourself
well
l
abbé
just
imagine
being
planted
down
on
the
carrefour
du
roi
together
with
the
village
doctor
the
wife
of
the
chief
of
police
and
irvoy
s
head
clerk
no
such
a
situation
is
not
to
be
thought
of
for
one
moment
but
if
i
wear
the
hunt
badge
i
can
follow
the
hounds
and
although
i
may
look
a
bit
off
colour
sometimes
i
ll
soon
show
them
whether
i
can
ride
or
not
now
can
get
me
what
i
want
l
abbé
the
brécés
will
not
refuse
you
anything
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
ask
it
in
the
name
of
i
beg
of
you
my
child
not
to
bring
into
such
a
matter
which
can
not
interest
her
in
the
very
slightest
the
miraculous
virgin
of
brécé
has
enough
to
do
in
answering
the
prayers
of
widows
and
orphans
not
to
mention
those
of
our
brave
soldiers
in
madagascar
but
my
dear
ernest
is
there
really
so
much
to
be
gained
by
the
possession
of
this
badge
is
it
then
such
a
precious
talisman
no
doubt
strange
privileges
are
attached
to
its
possession
tell
me
all
about
them
i
am
far
from
despising
the
noble
and
ancient
art
of
hunting
for
i
belong
to
the
clergy
of
an
eminently
sporting
diocese
and
would
be
glad
of
any
information
on
the
you
do
amuse
me
l
abbé
and
i
know
you
must
be
joking
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
is
understood
by
the
hunt
badge
it
is
the
right
to
wear
the
colours
of
any
particular
hunt
i
am
going
to
speak
frankly
to
you
i
am
candid
because
i
can
afford
to
be
so
i
want
to
be
made
a
member
of
the
brécé
hunt
because
it
is
the
correct
thing
and
i
like
to
be
in
the
swim
i
want
it
because
i
am
a
snob
and
a
vain
man
i
also
want
it
because
it
would
amuse
me
to
dine
with
the
brécés
on
hubert
s
day
the
brécé
badge
would
be
just
about
my
mark
i
want
it
very
badly
and
i
m
not
going
to
disguise
the
fact
i
have
no
false
shame
no
shame
of
any
kind
for
the
matter
of
that
listen
to
me
l
abbé
i
have
something
of
great
importance
to
say
to
you
you
must
understand
that
in
broaching
the
subject
to
the
duc
de
brécé
you
will
only
be
claiming
what
is
my
due
you
understand
my
due
i
have
property
round
here
i
do
not
shoot
the
deer
i
let
people
hunt
and
kill
on
my
estates
all
of
which
deserves
both
consideration
and
gratitude
de
brécé
is
really
under
obligations
to
his
kind
little
neighbour
the
abbé
said
nothing
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
idea
and
was
prepared
to
refuse
to
do
what
was
asked
of
him
young
bonmont
went
on
i
need
hardly
say
l
abbé
that
in
case
the
brécés
demand
a
price
in
return
for
the
privilege
i
should
not
stick
at
such
a
l
abbé
guitrel
made
a
movement
of
protest
banish
that
supposition
my
son
it
ill
accords
with
the
character
of
the
duc
de
that
may
be
l
abbé
whether
it
be
given
or
sold
depends
upon
the
owner
s
ideas
and
the
state
of
his
banking
account
some
packs
cost
the
master
francs
a
year
others
bring
him
in
as
much
as
francs
a
year
in
saying
this
i
am
not
in
any
way
blaming
the
man
who
expects
people
to
pay
for
their
privileges
personally
i
should
prefer
to
do
so
indeed
i
consider
it
only
fair
then
there
are
districts
where
hunting
costs
so
much
that
the
master
even
if
he
is
a
rich
man
can
not
keep
things
going
alone
just
suppose
for
instance
l
abbé
that
you
kept
a
pack
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
can
you
see
yourself
meeting
all
expenses
and
finding
your
purse
sufficient
to
pay
the
heavy
claims
entailed
but
i
think
i
have
heard
that
the
brécé
badge
is
not
to
be
bought
with
money
the
duke
hasn
t
the
gumption
to
make
a
profit
out
of
his
pack
well
l
abbé
you
will
get
it
for
me
gratis
and
for
nothing
it
will
all
be
so
much
to
the
before
replying
the
abbé
reflected
long
and
deeply
and
this
display
of
prudence
worried
young
bonmont
not
a
little
at
last
however
the
abbé
opened
his
lips
my
son
i
have
said
so
once
and
will
say
it
again
i
have
a
great
affection
for
you
and
should
like
both
to
please
and
to
aid
you
i
would
welcome
any
opportunity
of
doing
you
a
service
but
i
really
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
to
solicit
on
your
behalf
the
worldly
distinction
to
which
you
refer
just
think
for
a
moment
suppose
that
after
hearing
my
request
de
brécé
should
refuse
or
make
some
difficulty
about
granting
it
i
should
be
powerless
to
bring
any
pressure
to
bear
upon
him
what
chance
would
a
humble
professor
of
elocution
at
the
grand
séminaire
have
of
overcoming
resistance
removing
difficulty
and
obtaining
consent
so
to
speak
by
main
force
i
have
nothing
with
which
to
convince
and
hold
parley
with
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
i
can
not
must
not
even
in
so
paltry
a
matter
as
this
undertake
anything
without
being
assured
of
its
young
bonmont
looked
at
the
abbé
with
surprise
mingled
with
admiration
and
said
i
understand
l
abbé
you
can
not
manage
it
for
the
time
being
but
when
you
are
made
a
bishop
you
will
carry
off
the
badge
with
the
same
ease
as
a
man
at
a
fair
carries
off
the
ring
when
tilting
upon
the
wooden
horses
of
the
roundabouts
of
course
you
will
it
is
quite
possible
returned
guitrel
with
the
greatest
gravity
that
if
a
bishop
were
to
ask
for
the
hunt
badge
for
you
the
duke
would
not
refuse
chapter
iv
that
evening
bergeret
having
done
a
hard
day
s
work
was
feeling
tired
he
was
taking
his
customary
stroll
in
the
town
accompanied
by
goubin
his
favourite
disciple
since
the
treachery
of
roux
and
as
he
ruminated
over
the
work
he
had
accomplished
he
fell
to
wondering
like
so
many
others
before
him
what
profit
a
man
hath
of
all
his
labours
goubin
asked
master
do
you
think
that
paul
louis
courrier
would
be
a
good
subject
to
choose
for
an
essay
bergeret
made
no
reply
he
was
just
then
passing
the
shop
of
madame
fusellier
the
stationer
and
stopping
in
front
of
the
window
in
which
sundry
drawing
models
were
displayed
he
looked
with
interest
at
the
farnese
hercules
who
was
showing
off
his
muscles
amid
these
examples
of
scholastic
art
i
feel
kindly
disposed
towards
him
remarked
bergeret
towards
whom
asked
goubin
wiping
his
glasses
hercules
replied
bergeret
he
was
a
good
man
he
himself
said
my
life
is
laborious
and
tends
to
a
high
he
toiled
much
upon
this
earth
ere
he
received
the
reward
of
death
which
in
truth
is
the
only
guerdon
of
life
he
had
no
time
to
give
to
meditation
and
prolonged
thought
never
marred
the
simplicity
of
his
soul
but
when
evening
came
a
feeling
of
melancholy
would
steal
over
him
and
in
default
of
an
enquiring
mind
his
great
heart
would
reveal
to
him
the
vanity
of
effort
and
the
necessity
which
compels
all
men
even
the
best
to
do
evil
even
when
they
do
good
this
man
of
might
was
extraordinarily
gentle
like
the
rest
of
us
when
we
commit
ourselves
to
action
he
found
that
he
destroyed
indiscriminately
both
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
the
meek
and
the
violent
and
when
he
mused
over
all
this
it
doubtless
caused
him
more
than
one
regret
perhaps
he
even
felt
compassion
for
the
unhappy
monsters
he
had
destroyed
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
the
poor
cretan
bull
the
poor
lernæan
hydra
or
the
beautiful
lion
who
when
he
died
provided
him
with
such
an
excellently
warm
cloak
more
than
once
when
the
day
was
over
and
his
work
done
his
club
must
have
weighed
heavily
upon
bergeret
raised
aloft
his
umbrella
with
an
effort
as
though
it
had
been
a
heavy
weapon
then
he
continued
his
discourse
he
was
strong
yet
weak
we
love
him
because
he
is
like
hercules
asked
goubin
yes
replied
bergeret
like
ourselves
he
was
born
unhappy
the
child
of
a
god
and
a
woman
from
this
mixed
origin
he
derived
the
sadness
of
a
thoughtful
spirit
and
the
cravings
of
a
ravening
body
all
his
life
long
he
was
subject
to
the
caprices
of
a
whimsical
king
are
not
we
too
the
children
of
zeus
and
the
hapless
alcmena
and
the
slaves
of
eurystheus
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
the
minister
of
public
instruction
who
may
take
it
into
his
head
at
any
moment
to
ship
me
off
to
algiers
just
as
hercules
was
sent
to
the
land
of
the
you
are
not
leaving
us
dear
master
asked
goubin
anxiously
see
how
sad
he
is
went
on
bergeret
how
wearily
he
leans
upon
his
club
letting
his
arm
hang
limply
at
his
side
his
head
is
bowed
he
is
thinking
of
his
heavy
labours
the
farnese
hercules
was
certainly
conceived
after
the
statue
by
lysippus
who
was
a
blacksmith
s
apprentice
before
becoming
a
sculptor
and
it
is
undoubtedly
that
sturdy
sculptor
of
a
sturdy
hero
who
fixed
the
type
of
having
wiped
his
glasses
once
again
with
his
handkerchief
goubin
tried
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
principal
points
mentioned
by
the
master
and
while
he
was
thus
engaged
madame
fusellier
the
proprietress
of
the
shop
on
hearing
the
clock
strike
nine
extinguished
the
gas
under
the
disciple
s
peering
eyes
the
poor
man
had
no
idea
why
he
could
see
nothing
for
he
was
so
as
to
be
an
utter
stranger
to
that
imaginary
world
in
which
most
men
have
their
being
and
as
bergeret
continued
to
walk
and
talk
he
followed
the
sound
of
his
voice
for
he
trusted
only
to
what
he
heard
others
say
to
guide
him
along
those
pathways
of
the
earth
whereon
his
youthful
prudence
told
him
he
might
venture
his
strength
continued
the
professor
was
the
cause
of
his
weakness
he
was
under
the
yoke
of
his
own
strength
subject
to
the
exigencies
of
his
nature
which
compelled
him
to
devour
whole
sheep
drink
great
jars
of
dark
wine
and
to
do
foolish
deeds
for
women
of
little
worth
the
hero
whose
club
brought
peace
and
happiness
and
justice
to
the
world
the
son
of
the
great
god
zeus
would
seek
sleep
anywhere
like
a
mere
tramp
or
tarry
for
weeks
and
weeks
with
a
wench
whose
lover
he
was
and
this
was
the
cause
of
his
melancholy
with
his
simple
soul
his
submissiveness
his
love
of
justice
and
his
mighty
muscles
it
was
to
be
feared
that
he
could
be
nothing
more
than
an
excellent
soldier
or
a
glorified
gendarme
but
his
very
weaknesses
his
errors
his
unhappy
experiences
broadened
his
soul
opened
out
his
vision
upon
the
manifold
diversity
of
life
and
mellowed
with
gentleness
his
terrible
capacity
for
good
dear
master
said
goubin
do
you
not
think
that
hercules
is
the
sun
that
his
twelve
labours
are
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
that
dejanira
s
fiery
robe
represents
the
flaming
clouds
of
the
setting
sun
that
is
possible
replied
bergeret
but
i
do
not
wish
to
believe
it
it
pleases
me
to
have
the
same
idea
of
hercules
that
a
barber
of
thebes
or
a
of
eleusis
would
have
had
in
the
time
of
the
median
wars
i
think
this
idea
from
the
point
of
view
of
force
fullness
and
vivacity
is
worth
all
your
systems
of
comparative
mythology
put
together
hercules
was
a
man
when
he
went
to
seek
the
steeds
of
diomedes
he
crossed
through
pheræ
and
stayed
his
steps
before
the
palace
of
admetus
he
called
for
food
and
drink
and
spoke
very
roughly
to
the
servants
who
had
never
set
eyes
on
such
an
uncouth
guest
he
crowned
himself
with
myrtles
and
drank
enormous
quantities
of
wine
and
being
very
drunk
and
not
at
all
proud
he
tried
to
force
the
to
drink
with
him
but
the
latter
very
shocked
at
such
manners
replied
severely
that
it
was
no
time
for
eating
and
drinking
when
the
good
queen
alcestis
had
just
been
borne
to
the
grave
she
had
consecrated
herself
to
thanatos
in
place
of
her
husband
admetus
it
was
therefore
not
an
ordinary
death
but
a
kind
of
spell
which
had
been
cast
over
her
good
hercules
immediately
recovered
from
his
drunkenness
and
asked
whither
they
had
taken
alcestis
beyond
the
suburb
on
the
way
to
larissa
she
lay
in
a
tomb
of
polished
marble
thither
hastened
hercules
and
when
thanatos
robed
in
black
came
to
taste
of
the
offering
of
cakes
dipped
in
blood
the
hero
who
was
lying
in
ambush
behind
the
funeral
pile
threw
himself
upon
the
king
of
darkness
held
him
prisoner
in
the
circle
of
his
arms
and
forced
him
all
bruised
and
broken
to
give
up
alcestis
who
veiled
and
silent
returned
with
him
to
the
palace
of
admetus
this
time
he
would
accept
of
no
refreshment
he
was
in
haste
for
he
had
barely
time
to
fetch
the
steeds
of
diomedes
that
was
a
wonderful
adventure
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
tale
about
the
cercopes
do
you
know
the
story
of
the
two
brothers
goubin
one
was
called
andolous
and
the
other
atlantos
and
they
had
faces
like
monkeys
their
name
leads
me
to
believe
that
they
were
also
possessed
of
tails
like
the
smaller
species
of
the
monkey
tribe
they
were
very
cunning
thieves
and
robbed
the
orchards
and
their
mother
was
continually
warning
them
to
beware
of
the
hero
melampyges
this
you
know
was
the
name
familiarly
given
to
hercules
whose
skin
was
not
white
the
two
rash
little
creatures
disdained
their
mother
s
wise
counsels
and
one
day
having
surprised
the
melampyges
asleep
on
the
mossy
banks
of
a
stream
they
crept
up
to
him
to
try
and
steal
his
club
and
lionskin
but
the
hero
waking
suddenly
seized
them
tied
them
by
the
feet
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
slinging
them
over
his
shoulder
went
upon
his
way
the
cercopes
were
doubtless
very
uncomfortable
both
in
mind
and
body
but
as
the
latter
was
extremely
supple
and
the
former
they
were
amused
and
interested
in
everything
they
could
see
and
what
they
chiefly
saw
was
the
reason
for
the
hero
s
nickname
of
mélampyge
atlantos
pointed
this
out
to
his
brother
andolous
who
replied
that
their
captor
was
indeed
the
hero
of
whom
their
mother
had
spoken
and
as
they
hung
like
squirrels
from
a
hunter
s
spear
they
whispered
melampyges
melampyges
with
a
mocking
laugh
like
the
cry
of
the
forest
hercules
was
a
very
irritable
man
and
did
not
like
being
made
fun
of
but
he
was
not
over
proud
and
never
imagined
that
the
whole
of
his
body
was
as
white
as
that
of
poor
little
hylas
the
name
that
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
appeared
to
him
an
honourable
one
and
quite
worthy
of
a
strong
man
who
journeyed
about
accomplishing
great
labours
he
was
a
simple
soul
and
easily
moved
to
laughter
the
remarks
of
the
two
cercopes
struck
him
as
so
funny
that
he
stopped
short
and
placing
his
game
upon
the
ground
sat
down
by
the
wayside
and
began
to
shout
with
laughter
for
a
long
time
he
remained
there
filling
the
valley
with
the
sounds
of
his
mirth
the
setting
sun
spread
his
crimson
rays
over
the
clouds
and
gleamed
on
the
mountain
tops
and
still
the
hero
s
laughter
rang
out
from
beneath
the
dark
pines
and
tufted
larches
at
last
however
he
rose
untied
the
two
little
and
having
admonished
them
let
them
go
while
in
the
falling
darkness
he
continued
his
rough
journey
across
the
mountains
you
see
he
was
a
man
dear
master
said
goubin
allow
me
to
ask
you
a
question
do
you
consider
paul
louis
courrier
a
good
subject
for
my
essay
because
as
soon
as
i
have
got
my
degree
chapter
v
as
they
were
discussing
the
affair
at
paillot
s
library
in
a
corner
devoted
to
old
books
bergeret
who
was
of
a
speculative
turn
of
mind
gave
expression
to
ideas
upon
the
subject
that
were
not
in
accord
with
popular
sentiment
this
hearing
of
cases
in
camera
is
a
detestable
practice
he
said
and
as
de
terremondre
offered
in
defence
reasons
of
state
he
replied
we
have
no
state
we
have
administrations
what
we
call
reasons
of
state
are
simply
the
reasons
of
government
departments
we
are
told
that
such
reasons
are
sacred
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
afford
the
department
the
opportunity
to
hide
its
errors
and
at
the
same
time
to
aggravate
their
i
am
a
republican
a
jacobin
a
terrorist
and
a
patriot
remarked
mazure
solemnly
i
am
quite
willing
to
send
the
generals
to
the
guillotine
but
i
allow
no
one
to
dispute
the
decisions
of
military
and
you
are
right
replied
de
terremondre
for
if
any
justice
is
worthy
of
respect
it
is
that
above
all
others
and
knowing
the
army
as
i
do
i
can
assure
you
that
there
are
no
judges
so
indulgent
or
so
merciful
as
military
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
replied
bergeret
but
as
the
army
is
a
department
just
the
same
as
agriculture
finance
or
public
instruction
one
can
not
conceive
of
there
being
such
a
thing
as
military
courts
when
there
are
neither
agricultural
financial
nor
university
courts
any
peculiar
form
of
justice
is
directly
opposed
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
modern
law
the
military
provostships
will
appear
as
and
barbarous
to
our
descendants
as
seigniorial
and
ecclesiastical
courts
appear
to
us
you
are
joking
said
de
terremondre
that
is
what
has
been
said
of
every
prophet
replied
bergeret
but
if
you
attack
the
courts
martial
cried
de
terremondre
it
means
the
end
of
the
army
and
therefore
the
end
of
the
bergeret
s
reply
was
as
follows
when
the
priests
and
seigniors
were
deprived
of
the
right
of
hanging
their
serfs
people
thought
it
meant
the
end
of
all
law
and
order
soon
however
a
new
order
of
government
sprang
up
better
than
the
old
one
what
i
say
is
this
in
times
of
peace
let
the
soldier
be
judged
by
a
civil
court
do
you
imagine
that
since
the
time
of
charles
vii
or
even
since
napoleon
the
army
has
not
survived
more
drastic
innovations
than
that
i
am
an
old
jacobin
repeated
mazure
i
am
in
favour
of
courts
martial
and
would
have
the
heads
of
the
army
subject
to
the
authority
of
a
committee
of
public
safety
there
is
nothing
more
calculated
to
keep
them
up
to
the
that
s
another
matter
altogether
said
de
terremondre
i
return
to
our
original
subject
and
ask
bergeret
whether
he
honestly
believes
it
possible
that
officers
could
make
a
mistake
fourteen
cried
mazure
fourteen
repeated
de
terremondre
i
do
believe
it
possible
said
bergeret
fourteen
french
officers
ejaculated
de
terremondre
oh
well
said
bergeret
they
might
have
been
swiss
belgian
spanish
german
or
dutch
and
have
made
just
as
bad
a
impossible
cried
de
terremondre
the
librarian
paillot
shook
his
head
thereby
meaning
to
express
the
fact
that
he
also
considered
it
impossible
and
his
clerk
léon
looked
at
bergeret
with
indignant
surprise
i
do
not
know
whether
you
will
ever
be
enlightened
went
on
bergeret
sweetly
i
do
not
think
so
although
all
things
are
possible
even
the
triumph
of
you
mean
the
revision
said
de
terremondre
that
never
you
will
never
succeed
in
getting
the
revision
i
have
been
told
as
much
by
three
ministers
and
twenty
the
poet
bouchor
replied
bergeret
teaches
us
that
it
is
better
to
endure
the
horrors
of
war
than
to
commit
an
unjust
action
but
such
an
alternative
does
not
confront
you
gentlemen
and
you
are
being
scared
with
just
as
bergeret
was
saying
this
a
great
noise
was
heard
in
the
square
outside
a
band
of
little
boys
was
marching
past
and
shouting
bas
zola
mort
aux
juifs
they
were
on
their
way
to
break
the
windows
of
meyer
the
bootmaker
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
jew
and
the
townsmen
indulgently
watched
them
go
by
fine
little
chaps
cried
de
terremondre
when
the
demonstrators
had
filed
by
bergeret
with
his
nose
buried
in
a
ponderous
volume
slowly
remarked
the
cause
of
liberty
had
only
the
very
smallest
minority
of
educated
people
upon
her
side
the
clergy
almost
to
a
man
the
generals
and
the
ignorant
and
fanatical
mob
clamoured
for
a
what
is
that
you
are
saying
asked
mazure
excitedly
nothing
replied
bergeret
i
am
reading
a
chapter
of
spanish
history
which
describes
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
people
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
of
ferdinand
the
bootmaker
meyer
was
half
killed
nevertheless
he
did
not
complain
for
fear
of
being
killed
outright
and
also
because
the
justice
of
the
people
together
with
that
of
the
army
filled
him
with
mute
admiration
chapter
vi
bergeret
was
not
unhappy
for
he
rejoiced
in
that
true
independence
which
comes
from
within
and
his
soul
was
unfettered
since
the
departure
of
his
wife
he
was
also
enjoying
the
sweets
of
solitude
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
his
daughter
pauline
who
was
shortly
expected
from
arcachon
with
his
sister
mademoiselle
bergeret
he
looked
forward
to
a
happy
life
with
his
daughter
who
resembled
him
in
certain
turns
of
mind
and
speech
so
that
it
flattered
his
vanity
when
people
praised
her
he
was
pleased
at
the
idea
of
seeing
his
sister
zoe
an
old
maid
who
having
never
had
any
pretensions
to
good
looks
had
not
lost
her
natural
frankness
of
disposition
to
which
was
added
a
secret
delight
in
making
herself
unpleasant
but
who
lacked
neither
wit
nor
kindliness
for
the
time
being
however
bergeret
was
busy
settling
down
in
his
new
quarters
he
hung
his
views
of
naples
and
vesuvius
legacies
both
on
the
walls
of
his
study
now
of
all
the
delights
permitted
to
a
respectable
man
there
is
perhaps
none
which
procures
him
such
tranquil
enjoyment
as
that
of
knocking
nails
into
a
wall
the
keenest
pleasure
of
that
experienced
voluptuary
comte
de
caylus
was
unpacking
cases
of
etruscan
pottery
thus
bergeret
proceeded
to
hang
up
on
his
wall
an
old
representing
vesuvius
adorned
with
an
aigrette
of
flame
and
smoke
standing
out
against
the
dark
blue
sky
of
midnight
this
picture
reminded
him
of
the
days
of
his
wondering
and
enchanted
childhood
he
was
not
sad
neither
was
he
glad
he
had
money
worries
he
knew
the
unloveliness
of
poverty
money
makes
the
man
as
pindar
says
ii
he
did
not
get
on
with
his
colleagues
or
his
pupils
he
did
not
get
on
with
the
townspeople
incapable
as
he
was
of
comprehending
either
their
thoughts
or
their
feelings
he
had
been
obliged
to
withdraw
from
human
fellowship
and
his
peculiar
way
of
thinking
had
deprived
him
of
the
enjoyment
of
that
genial
feeling
of
comradeship
which
even
high
walls
and
closed
doors
can
not
exclude
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
a
thinker
made
him
a
strange
and
disturbing
element
suspected
by
all
he
was
even
a
source
of
worry
to
paillot
the
bookseller
and
his
asylum
and
refuge
the
corner
where
the
old
books
were
kept
was
no
longer
to
be
counted
on
in
spite
of
all
this
he
was
not
unhappy
he
set
about
arranging
his
books
on
the
deal
shelves
put
up
by
the
carpenter
and
took
pleasure
in
handling
these
little
memorials
of
his
humble
contemplative
life
he
worked
with
zeal
at
his
task
of
getting
things
straight
and
when
he
tired
of
hanging
pictures
or
arranging
furniture
he
buried
himself
deep
in
some
book
with
a
lurking
feeling
however
that
he
ought
not
to
enjoy
it
because
it
was
a
human
product
yet
enjoying
it
notwithstanding
he
read
a
few
pages
on
the
progress
realized
by
modern
society
and
his
reflections
ran
as
follows
let
us
be
humble
and
believe
ourselves
in
no
way
excellent
for
we
are
not
excellent
as
we
examine
ourselves
let
us
uncover
our
true
countenance
which
is
rough
and
violent
like
that
of
our
forefathers
and
as
we
have
the
advantage
over
them
of
a
longer
tradition
let
us
at
least
recognize
the
sequence
and
continuity
of
our
thus
pondered
bergeret
as
he
settled
himself
in
his
new
abode
he
was
not
sad
neither
was
he
glad
as
he
reflected
that
he
would
always
yearn
in
vain
for
madame
de
gromance
not
realizing
the
fact
that
she
was
only
precious
to
him
by
virtue
of
the
craving
which
she
inspired
but
the
very
derangement
of
his
feelings
prevented
him
from
clearly
grasping
this
philosophical
truth
he
was
not
handsome
he
was
not
young
he
was
not
rich
he
was
not
sad
because
his
wisdom
approached
the
happy
state
of
ataraxy
without
however
finally
attaining
it
and
he
was
not
glad
because
he
was
somewhat
of
a
sensualist
and
his
soul
was
not
free
from
illusions
and
desires
the
servant
marie
who
had
fulfilled
her
task
of
bringing
terror
and
misery
into
the
house
had
been
dismissed
and
in
her
place
he
had
engaged
a
decent
woman
from
the
town
whom
he
called
angélique
but
who
was
spoken
of
as
madame
borniche
by
the
shopkeepers
and
the
in
the
her
husband
nicolas
borniche
a
good
coachman
but
a
bad
man
had
deserted
her
when
she
was
still
young
and
ugly
she
had
been
in
service
with
various
families
her
status
as
a
married
woman
still
filled
her
with
a
certain
pride
not
always
concealed
and
with
a
great
fondness
for
managing
finally
she
was
by
way
of
being
a
herbalist
and
a
healer
something
of
a
sorceress
and
filled
the
house
with
a
pleasant
odour
of
herbs
full
of
genuine
zeal
she
was
obsessed
by
an
eternal
longing
for
affection
and
approval
from
the
very
first
she
had
taken
to
bergeret
on
account
of
the
distinction
of
his
mind
and
the
gentleness
of
his
manner
but
she
awaited
the
arrival
of
mademoiselle
bergeret
with
foreboding
for
a
secret
presentiment
told
her
that
she
would
not
get
on
well
with
the
sister
from
arcachon
on
the
other
hand
she
pleased
bergeret
who
was
at
last
enjoying
peace
in
his
house
and
deliverance
from
all
his
troubles
his
books
which
heretofore
had
been
despised
and
thrown
about
were
now
displayed
upon
long
shelves
in
the
big
sunny
room
there
he
could
work
in
quiet
at
his
and
indulge
freely
in
silent
orgies
of
meditation
before
the
window
a
young
plane
tree
gently
waved
its
pointed
leaves
and
farther
away
a
dark
buttress
of
reared
its
jagged
pinnacle
in
which
grew
a
cherry
tree
doubtless
planted
there
by
a
bird
seated
at
his
table
one
morning
in
front
of
the
window
against
which
the
leaves
of
the
plane
tree
quivered
bergeret
who
was
trying
to
discover
how
the
ships
of
æneas
had
been
changed
into
nymphs
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
and
forthwith
his
servant
entered
carrying
in
front
of
her
a
tiny
creature
whose
black
head
peeped
out
from
the
folds
of
her
apron
which
she
had
turned
up
to
form
a
pocket
with
a
look
of
anxiety
and
hope
upon
her
face
she
remained
motionless
for
a
moment
then
she
placed
the
little
thing
upon
the
carpet
at
her
master
s
feet
what
s
that
asked
bergeret
it
was
a
little
dog
of
doubtful
breed
having
something
of
the
terrier
in
him
and
a
head
a
short
smooth
coat
of
a
dark
tan
colour
and
a
tiny
little
stump
of
a
tail
his
body
retained
its
softness
and
he
went
sniffing
at
the
carpet
angélique
said
bergeret
take
this
animal
back
to
its
it
has
no
owner
bergeret
looked
silently
at
the
little
creature
who
had
come
to
examine
his
slippers
and
was
giving
little
sniffs
of
approval
bergeret
was
a
philologist
which
perhaps
explains
why
at
this
juncture
he
asked
a
vain
question
what
is
he
called
monsieur
replied
angélique
he
has
no
bergeret
seemed
put
out
at
this
answer
he
looked
at
the
dog
sadly
with
a
disheartened
air
then
the
little
animal
placed
its
two
front
paws
on
bergeret
s
slipper
and
holding
it
thus
began
innocently
to
nibble
at
it
with
a
sudden
access
of
compassion
bergeret
took
the
tiny
nameless
creature
upon
his
knees
the
dog
looked
at
him
intently
and
bergeret
was
pleased
at
his
confiding
expression
what
beautiful
eyes
he
cried
the
dog
s
eyes
were
indeed
beautiful
the
pupils
of
a
chestnut
set
in
warm
white
and
his
gaze
spoke
of
simple
mysterious
thoughts
common
alike
to
the
thoughtful
beasts
and
simple
men
of
the
earth
tired
perhaps
with
the
intellectual
effort
he
had
made
for
the
purpose
of
entering
into
communication
with
a
human
being
he
closed
his
beautiful
eyes
and
yawning
widely
revealed
his
pink
mouth
his
tongue
and
his
array
of
dazzling
teeth
bergeret
put
his
hand
into
the
dog
s
mouth
and
allowed
him
to
lick
it
at
which
old
angélique
gave
a
smile
of
relief
a
more
affectionate
little
creature
doesn
t
breathe
she
said
the
dog
said
bergeret
is
a
religious
animal
in
his
savage
state
he
worships
the
moon
and
the
lights
that
float
upon
the
waters
these
are
his
gods
to
whom
he
appeals
at
night
with
howls
in
the
domesticated
state
he
seeks
by
his
caresses
to
conciliate
those
powerful
genii
who
dispense
the
good
things
of
this
world
to
wit
men
he
worships
and
honours
men
by
the
accomplishment
of
the
rites
passed
down
to
him
by
his
ancestors
he
licks
their
hand
jumps
against
their
legs
and
when
they
show
signs
of
anger
towards
him
he
approaches
them
crawling
on
his
belly
as
a
sign
of
humility
to
appease
their
all
dogs
are
not
the
friends
of
man
remarked
angélique
some
of
them
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
those
are
the
ungodly
blasphemous
dogs
returned
bergeret
insensate
creatures
like
ajax
the
son
of
telamon
who
wounded
the
hand
of
the
golden
aphrodite
these
sacrilegious
creatures
die
a
dreadful
death
or
lead
wandering
and
miserable
lives
they
are
not
to
be
confounded
with
those
dogs
who
espousing
the
quarrel
of
their
own
particular
god
wage
war
upon
his
enemy
the
neighbouring
god
they
are
heroes
such
for
example
is
the
dog
of
lafolie
the
butcher
who
fixed
his
sharp
teeth
into
the
leg
of
the
tramp
alouette
for
it
is
a
fact
that
dogs
fight
among
themselves
like
men
and
turk
with
his
snub
nose
serves
his
god
lafolie
against
the
robber
gods
in
the
same
way
that
israel
helped
jehovah
to
destroy
chamos
and
the
puppy
however
having
decided
that
bergeret
s
remarks
were
the
reverse
of
interesting
curled
up
his
feet
and
stretched
out
his
head
ready
to
go
to
sleep
upon
the
knees
that
harboured
him
where
did
you
find
him
asked
bergeret
well
monsieur
it
was
dellion
s
gave
him
to
with
the
result
continued
bergeret
that
we
now
have
this
soul
to
care
what
soul
asked
angélique
this
canine
soul
an
animal
is
properly
speaking
a
soul
i
do
not
say
an
immortal
soul
and
yet
when
i
come
to
consider
the
positions
this
poor
little
beast
and
i
myself
occupy
in
the
scheme
of
things
i
recognize
in
both
exactly
the
same
right
to
after
considerable
hesitation
old
angélique
with
a
painful
effort
that
made
her
upper
lip
curl
up
and
reveal
her
two
remaining
teeth
said
if
monsieur
does
not
want
a
dog
i
will
return
him
to
dellion
s
but
you
may
safely
keep
him
i
assure
you
you
won
t
see
or
hear
she
had
hardly
finished
her
sentence
when
the
puppy
hearing
a
heavy
van
rolling
down
the
street
sat
bolt
upright
on
bergeret
s
knees
and
began
to
bark
both
loud
and
long
so
that
the
resounded
with
the
noise
bergeret
smiled
he
is
a
said
angélique
by
way
of
excuse
they
are
by
far
the
most
have
you
given
him
anything
to
eat
asked
bergeret
of
course
returned
angélique
what
does
he
eat
monsieur
must
be
aware
that
dogs
eat
bread
and
somewhat
piqued
bergeret
retorted
that
in
her
eagerness
she
might
very
likely
have
taken
him
away
from
his
mother
before
he
was
old
enough
to
leave
her
upon
which
he
was
lifted
up
again
and
only
to
make
sure
of
the
fact
that
he
was
at
least
six
months
old
bergeret
put
him
down
on
the
carpet
and
regarded
him
with
interest
isn
t
he
pretty
said
the
servant
no
he
is
not
pretty
replied
bergeret
but
he
is
engaging
and
has
beautiful
eyes
that
is
what
people
used
to
say
about
me
added
the
professor
when
i
was
three
times
as
old
and
not
half
as
intelligent
since
then
i
have
no
doubt
acquired
an
outlook
upon
the
universe
which
he
will
never
attain
but
in
comparison
with
the
absolute
i
may
say
that
my
knowledge
equals
his
in
the
smallness
of
its
extent
like
his
it
is
a
geometrical
point
in
the
then
addressing
the
little
creature
who
was
sniffing
the
basket
he
went
on
smell
it
out
sniff
it
well
take
from
the
outside
world
all
the
knowledge
that
can
reach
your
simple
brain
through
the
medium
of
that
black
nose
of
yours
and
what
though
i
at
the
same
time
observe
and
compare
and
study
we
shall
never
know
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
of
us
why
we
have
been
put
into
this
world
and
what
we
are
doing
in
it
what
are
we
here
for
eh
as
he
had
spoken
rather
loudly
the
puppy
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
bergeret
returning
to
the
thought
which
had
first
filled
his
mind
said
to
the
servant
we
must
give
him
a
with
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
she
replied
laughingly
that
that
would
not
be
a
difficult
matter
upon
which
bergeret
made
the
private
reflection
that
to
the
simple
all
things
are
simple
but
that
souls
who
look
upon
things
from
many
and
divers
aspects
invisible
to
the
vulgar
mind
experience
the
greatest
difficulty
in
coming
to
a
decision
about
even
the
most
trivial
matters
and
he
cudgelled
his
brains
trying
to
hit
upon
a
name
for
the
little
living
thing
who
was
busily
engaged
in
nibbling
the
fringe
of
the
carpet
all
the
names
of
dogs
thought
he
preserved
in
the
ancient
treatises
of
the
huntsmen
of
old
such
as
fouilloux
and
in
the
verses
of
our
sylvan
poets
such
as
la
fontaine
finaud
miraut
briffaut
ravaud
and
names
are
given
to
sporting
dogs
who
are
the
aristocracy
of
the
kennel
the
chivalry
of
the
canine
race
the
dog
of
ulysses
was
called
argos
and
he
was
a
hunter
too
so
homer
tells
us
in
his
youth
he
hunted
the
little
hares
of
ithaca
but
now
he
was
old
and
hunted
no
what
we
require
is
something
quite
different
the
names
given
by
old
maids
to
their
would
be
more
suitable
were
they
not
usually
pretentious
and
absurd
azor
for
instance
is
ridiculous
so
bergeret
ruminated
calling
to
memory
many
a
dog
name
without
being
able
to
decide
however
on
one
that
pleased
him
he
would
have
liked
to
invent
a
name
but
lacked
the
imagination
what
day
is
it
he
asked
at
last
the
ninth
replied
angélique
thursday
the
well
then
said
bergeret
can
t
we
call
the
dog
thursday
like
robinson
crusoe
who
called
his
man
friday
for
the
same
reason
as
monsieur
pleases
said
angélique
but
it
isn
t
very
very
well
said
bergeret
find
a
name
for
the
creature
yourself
for
after
all
you
brought
him
oh
no
said
the
servant
i
couldn
t
find
a
name
for
him
i
m
not
clever
enough
when
i
saw
him
lying
on
the
straw
in
the
kitchen
i
called
him
riquet
and
he
came
up
and
played
about
under
my
you
called
him
riquet
did
you
cried
bergeret
why
didn
t
you
say
so
before
riquet
he
is
and
riquet
he
shall
remain
that
s
settled
now
be
off
with
you
and
take
riquet
with
you
i
want
to
monsieur
returned
angélique
i
am
going
to
leave
the
puppy
with
you
i
will
come
for
him
when
i
get
back
from
you
could
quite
well
take
him
to
market
with
you
retorted
bergeret
monsieur
i
am
going
to
church
as
it
was
quite
true
that
she
really
was
going
to
church
at
to
ask
for
a
mass
to
be
said
for
the
repose
of
her
husband
s
soul
she
did
that
regularly
once
a
year
not
that
she
had
ever
been
informed
of
the
decease
of
borniche
who
had
never
communicated
with
her
since
his
desertion
but
it
was
a
settled
thing
in
the
good
woman
s
mind
that
borniche
was
dead
she
had
therefore
no
fear
of
his
coming
to
rob
her
of
the
little
she
had
and
did
her
best
to
fix
things
up
to
his
advantage
in
the
other
world
so
long
as
he
left
her
in
peace
in
this
one
eh
ejaculated
bergeret
shut
him
up
in
the
kitchen
or
some
other
convenient
place
and
do
not
wor
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
for
angélique
had
vanished
purposely
pretending
not
to
hear
that
she
might
leave
riquet
with
his
master
she
wanted
them
to
grow
used
to
one
another
and
she
also
wanted
to
give
poor
friendless
bergeret
a
companion
having
closed
the
door
behind
her
she
went
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
steps
bergeret
set
to
work
again
and
plunged
head
foremost
into
his
he
loved
the
work
it
rested
his
thoughts
and
became
a
kind
of
game
that
suited
him
for
he
played
it
all
by
himself
on
the
table
beside
him
were
several
boxes
filled
with
pegs
which
he
fixed
into
little
squares
of
cardboard
to
represent
the
fleet
of
æneas
now
while
he
was
thus
occupied
he
felt
something
like
tiny
fists
tapping
at
his
legs
riquet
whom
he
had
quite
forgotten
was
standing
on
his
hind
legs
patting
his
master
s
knees
and
wagging
his
little
stump
of
a
tail
when
he
tired
of
this
he
let
his
paws
slide
down
the
trouser
leg
then
got
up
and
began
his
coaxing
over
again
and
bergeret
turning
away
from
the
printed
lore
before
him
saw
two
brown
eyes
gazing
up
at
him
lovingly
what
gives
a
human
beauty
to
the
gaze
of
this
dog
he
thought
is
probably
that
it
varies
unceasingly
being
by
turns
bright
and
vivacious
or
serious
and
sorrowful
because
through
these
eyes
his
little
dumb
soul
finds
expression
for
thought
that
lacks
nothing
in
depth
nor
sequence
my
father
was
very
fond
of
cats
and
consequently
i
liked
them
too
he
used
to
declare
that
cats
are
the
wise
man
s
best
companions
for
they
respect
his
studious
hours
bajazet
his
persian
cat
would
sit
at
night
for
hours
at
a
stretch
motionless
and
majestic
perched
on
a
corner
of
his
table
i
still
remember
the
agate
eyes
of
bajazet
but
those
orbs
concealed
all
thought
that
stare
was
cold
and
hard
and
wicked
how
much
do
i
prefer
the
melting
gaze
of
the
dog
riquet
however
was
agitating
his
paws
in
frantic
fashion
and
bergeret
who
was
anxious
to
return
to
his
philological
amusements
said
kindly
but
shortly
lie
down
riquet
upon
which
riquet
went
and
thrust
his
nose
against
the
door
through
which
angélique
had
passed
out
and
there
he
remained
uttering
from
time
to
time
plaintive
meek
little
cries
after
a
while
he
began
to
scratch
making
a
gentle
rasping
noise
on
the
polished
floor
with
his
nails
then
the
whining
began
again
followed
by
more
scratching
disturbed
by
these
sounds
bergeret
sternly
bade
him
keep
still
riquet
peered
at
him
sorrowfully
with
his
brown
eyes
then
sitting
down
he
looked
at
bergeret
again
rose
returned
to
the
door
sniffed
underneath
it
and
wailed
afresh
do
you
want
to
go
out
asked
bergeret
putting
down
his
pen
he
went
to
the
door
which
he
held
a
few
inches
open
after
making
sure
that
he
was
running
no
risk
of
hurting
himself
on
the
way
out
riquet
slipped
through
the
doorway
and
marched
off
with
a
composure
that
was
scarcely
polite
on
returning
to
his
table
bergeret
sensitive
man
that
he
was
pondered
over
the
dog
s
action
he
said
to
himself
i
was
on
the
point
of
reproaching
the
animal
for
going
without
saying
either
or
thank
you
and
expecting
him
to
apologize
for
leaving
me
it
was
the
beautiful
human
expression
of
his
eyes
that
made
me
so
foolish
i
was
beginning
to
look
upon
him
as
one
of
my
own
after
making
this
reflection
bergeret
applied
himself
anew
to
the
metamorphosis
of
the
ships
of
æneas
a
legend
both
pretty
and
popular
but
perhaps
a
trifle
too
simple
in
itself
for
expression
in
such
noble
language
bergeret
however
saw
nothing
incongruous
in
it
he
knew
that
the
nursery
tales
have
furnished
material
for
nearly
all
epics
and
that
virgil
had
carefully
collected
together
in
his
poem
the
riddles
the
puns
the
uncouth
stories
and
the
puerile
imaginings
of
his
forefathers
that
homer
his
master
and
the
master
of
all
the
bards
had
done
little
more
than
tell
over
again
what
the
good
wives
of
ionia
and
the
fishermen
of
the
islands
had
been
narrating
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
before
him
besides
for
the
time
being
this
was
the
least
of
his
worries
he
had
another
far
more
important
preoccupation
an
expression
met
with
in
the
course
of
the
charming
story
of
the
metamorphosis
did
not
appear
sufficiently
plain
to
him
that
was
what
was
worrying
him
bergeret
my
friend
he
said
to
himself
this
is
where
you
must
open
your
eyes
and
show
your
sense
remember
that
virgil
always
expresses
himself
with
extreme
precision
when
writing
on
the
technique
of
the
arts
remember
that
he
went
yachting
at
baïae
that
he
was
an
expert
in
naval
construction
and
that
therefore
his
language
in
this
passage
must
have
a
precise
and
definite
and
bergeret
carefully
consulted
a
great
number
of
texts
in
order
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
word
which
he
could
not
understand
and
which
he
had
to
explain
he
was
almost
on
the
point
of
grasping
the
solution
or
at
any
rate
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
when
he
heard
a
noise
like
the
rattling
of
chains
at
his
door
a
noise
which
although
not
alarming
struck
him
as
curious
the
disturbance
was
presently
accompanied
by
a
shrill
whining
and
bergeret
interrupted
in
his
philological
investigations
immediately
concluded
that
these
importunate
wails
must
emanate
from
riquet
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
having
looked
vainly
all
over
the
house
for
angélique
riquet
had
been
seized
with
a
desire
to
see
bergeret
again
solitude
was
as
painful
to
him
as
human
society
was
dear
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
noise
and
also
because
he
had
a
secret
desire
to
see
riquet
again
bergeret
got
up
from
his
and
opened
the
door
and
riquet
the
study
with
the
same
coolness
with
which
he
had
quitted
it
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
door
close
behind
him
he
assumed
a
melancholy
expression
and
began
to
wander
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
soul
in
torment
he
had
a
sudden
way
of
appearing
to
find
something
of
interest
beneath
the
chairs
and
tables
and
would
sniff
long
and
noisily
then
he
would
walk
aimlessly
about
or
sit
down
in
a
corner
with
an
air
of
great
humility
like
the
beggars
who
are
to
be
seen
in
church
porches
finally
he
began
to
bark
at
a
cast
of
hermes
which
stood
upon
the
mantelshelf
whereupon
bergeret
addressed
him
in
words
full
of
just
reproach
riquet
such
vain
agitation
such
sniffing
and
barking
were
better
suited
to
a
stable
than
to
the
study
of
a
professor
and
they
lead
one
to
suppose
that
your
ancestors
lived
with
horses
whose
straw
litters
they
shared
i
do
not
reproach
you
with
that
it
is
only
natural
you
should
have
inherited
their
habits
manners
and
tendencies
as
well
as
their
coat
their
body
and
their
long
thin
nose
i
do
not
speak
of
your
beautiful
eyes
for
there
are
few
men
few
dogs
even
who
can
open
such
beauties
to
the
light
of
day
but
leaving
all
that
aside
you
are
a
mongrel
my
friend
a
mongrel
from
your
short
bandy
legs
to
your
head
again
i
am
far
from
despising
you
for
that
what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
that
if
you
desire
to
live
with
me
you
will
have
to
drop
your
mongrel
manners
and
behave
like
a
in
other
words
to
remain
silent
and
quiet
to
respect
work
after
the
manner
of
bajazet
who
of
a
night
would
sit
for
four
hours
without
stirring
and
watch
my
father
s
pen
skimming
over
the
paper
he
was
a
silent
and
tactful
creature
how
different
is
your
own
character
my
friend
since
you
came
into
this
chamber
of
study
your
hoarse
voice
your
unseemly
snufflings
and
your
whines
that
sound
like
steam
whistles
have
constantly
confused
my
thoughts
and
interrupted
my
reflections
and
now
you
have
made
me
lose
the
drift
of
an
important
passage
in
servius
referring
to
the
construction
of
one
of
the
ships
of
æneas
know
then
riquet
my
friend
that
this
is
the
house
of
silence
and
the
abode
of
meditation
and
that
if
you
are
anxious
to
stay
here
you
must
become
literary
be
quiet
thus
spoke
bergeret
riquet
who
had
listened
to
him
with
mute
astonishment
approached
his
master
and
with
suppliant
gesture
placed
a
timid
paw
upon
the
knee
which
he
seemed
to
revere
in
a
fashion
that
savoured
of
long
ago
then
a
kind
thought
struck
bergeret
he
picked
him
up
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
put
him
upon
the
cushions
of
the
ample
easy
chair
in
which
he
was
sitting
turning
himself
round
three
times
riquet
lay
down
and
then
remained
perfectly
still
and
silent
he
was
quite
happy
bergeret
was
grateful
to
him
and
as
he
ran
through
servius
he
occasionally
stroked
the
coat
which
without
being
soft
was
smooth
and
very
pleasant
to
the
touch
riquet
fell
into
a
gentle
doze
and
communicated
to
his
master
the
generous
warmth
of
his
body
the
subtle
gentle
heat
of
a
living
breathing
thing
and
from
that
moment
bergeret
found
more
pleasure
in
his
from
floor
to
ceiling
his
study
was
lined
with
deal
shelves
bearing
books
arranged
in
methodical
order
one
glance
and
all
that
remains
to
us
of
latin
thought
was
ready
to
his
hand
the
greeks
lay
up
in
a
quiet
corner
easy
of
access
were
rabelais
the
excellent
of
the
nouvelles
bonaventure
des
périers
guillaume
bouchet
and
all
the
old
french
conteurs
whom
bergeret
considered
better
adapted
to
humanity
than
writings
in
the
more
heroic
style
and
who
were
the
favourite
reading
of
his
leisure
he
only
possessed
them
in
cheap
modern
editions
but
he
had
discovered
a
poor
bookbinder
in
the
town
who
covered
his
volumes
with
leaves
from
a
book
of
anthems
and
it
gave
bergeret
the
keenest
pleasure
to
see
these
gentlemen
thus
clad
in
requiems
and
misereres
this
was
the
sole
luxury
and
the
only
peculiarity
of
his
austere
library
the
other
books
were
or
bound
in
poor
and
bindings
the
gentle
friendly
manner
in
which
they
were
handled
by
their
owner
gave
them
the
look
of
tools
set
out
in
a
busy
man
s
workshop
the
books
on
archæology
and
art
found
a
on
the
highest
shelves
not
by
any
means
out
of
contempt
but
because
they
were
not
so
often
used
now
while
bergeret
worked
at
his
and
shared
his
chair
with
riquet
he
found
as
chance
would
have
it
that
it
was
necessary
to
consult
ottfried
müller
s
little
which
happened
to
be
on
one
of
the
topmost
shelves
there
was
no
need
of
one
of
those
tall
ladders
on
wheels
topped
by
railings
and
a
shelf
to
enable
him
to
reach
the
book
there
were
ladders
of
this
description
in
the
town
library
and
they
had
been
used
by
all
the
great
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
indeed
several
of
the
latter
had
fallen
from
them
and
thus
died
honourable
deaths
in
the
manner
spoken
of
in
the
pamphlet
entitled
bibliophiles
qui
moururent
en
tombant
de
leur
no
indeed
bergeret
had
no
need
of
anything
of
the
sort
a
small
pair
of
folding
steps
would
have
served
his
purpose
excellently
well
and
he
had
once
seen
some
in
the
shop
of
clérambaut
the
in
the
rue
de
josde
they
folded
up
and
looked
just
the
thing
with
their
bevelled
uprights
each
pierced
with
a
trefoil
as
a
grip
for
the
hand
bergeret
would
have
given
anything
to
possess
them
but
the
state
of
his
finances
which
were
somewhat
involved
forced
him
to
abandon
the
idea
no
one
knew
better
than
he
did
that
financial
ills
are
not
mortal
but
for
all
that
he
had
no
steps
in
his
study
in
place
of
such
a
pair
of
steps
he
used
an
old
chair
the
back
of
which
had
been
broken
leaving
only
two
horns
or
antennæ
which
had
shewn
themselves
to
be
more
dangerous
than
useful
so
they
had
been
cut
to
the
level
of
the
seat
and
the
chair
had
become
a
stool
there
were
two
reasons
why
this
stool
was
to
the
use
to
which
bergeret
was
wont
to
put
it
in
the
first
place
the
seat
had
grown
slack
with
long
use
and
now
contained
a
large
hollow
making
one
s
foothold
precarious
in
the
second
place
the
stool
was
too
low
and
it
was
hardly
possible
when
standing
upon
it
to
reach
the
books
on
the
highest
shelf
even
with
the
what
generally
happened
was
that
in
the
endeavour
to
grasp
one
book
several
others
fell
out
and
it
depended
upon
their
being
bound
or
whether
they
lay
with
broken
corners
or
sprawled
with
leaves
spread
like
a
fan
or
a
concertina
now
with
the
intention
of
getting
down
the
of
ottfried
müller
bergeret
quitted
the
chair
he
was
sharing
with
riquet
who
rolled
into
a
ball
with
his
head
tight
pressed
to
his
body
lay
in
warm
comfort
opening
one
voluptuous
eye
which
he
reclosed
as
quickly
then
bergeret
drew
the
stool
from
the
dark
corner
where
it
was
hidden
and
placed
it
where
it
was
required
hoisted
himself
upon
it
and
managed
by
making
his
arm
as
long
as
possible
and
straining
upon
tiptoe
to
touch
first
with
one
then
with
two
fingers
the
back
of
a
book
which
he
judged
to
be
the
one
he
was
needing
as
for
the
thumb
it
remained
below
the
shelf
and
rendered
no
assistance
whatever
bergeret
who
found
it
therefore
exceedingly
difficult
to
draw
out
the
book
made
the
reflection
that
the
reason
why
the
hand
is
a
precious
implement
is
on
account
of
the
position
of
the
thumb
and
that
no
being
could
rise
to
be
an
artist
who
had
four
feet
and
no
hands
it
is
to
the
hand
he
reflected
that
men
owe
their
power
of
becoming
engineers
painters
writers
and
manipulators
of
all
kinds
of
things
if
they
had
not
a
thumb
as
well
as
their
other
fingers
they
would
be
as
incapable
as
i
am
at
this
moment
and
they
could
never
have
changed
the
face
of
the
earth
as
they
have
done
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
the
shape
of
the
hand
that
has
assured
to
man
the
conquest
of
the
then
almost
simultaneously
bergeret
remembered
that
monkeys
who
possess
four
hands
have
not
for
all
that
created
the
arts
nor
disposed
the
earth
to
their
use
and
he
erased
from
his
mind
the
theory
upon
which
he
had
just
embarked
however
he
did
the
best
he
could
with
his
four
fingers
it
must
be
known
that
ottfried
müller
s
is
composed
of
three
volumes
and
an
atlas
bergeret
wanted
volume
i
he
pulled
out
first
the
second
volume
then
the
atlas
then
volume
three
and
finally
the
book
that
he
required
at
last
he
held
it
in
his
hands
all
that
now
remained
for
him
to
do
was
to
descend
and
this
he
was
about
to
do
when
the
cane
seat
gave
way
beneath
his
foot
which
passed
through
it
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
to
the
ground
not
as
heavily
as
might
have
been
feared
for
he
broke
his
fall
by
grasping
at
one
of
the
uprights
of
the
bookshelf
he
was
on
the
ground
however
full
of
astonishment
and
wearing
on
one
leg
the
broken
chair
his
whole
body
was
permeated
and
as
though
constricted
by
a
pain
that
spread
all
over
it
and
that
presently
settled
itself
more
particularly
in
the
region
of
the
left
elbow
and
hip
upon
which
he
had
fallen
but
as
his
anatomy
was
not
seriously
damaged
he
gathered
his
wits
together
he
had
got
so
far
as
to
realize
that
he
must
draw
his
right
leg
out
of
the
stool
in
which
it
had
so
unfortunately
become
entangled
and
that
he
must
be
careful
to
raise
himself
up
on
his
right
side
which
was
unhurt
he
was
even
trying
to
put
this
into
execution
when
he
felt
a
warm
breath
upon
his
cheek
and
turning
his
eyes
which
fright
and
pain
had
for
the
moment
fixed
he
saw
close
to
his
cheek
riquet
s
little
face
at
the
sound
of
the
fall
riquet
had
jumped
down
from
the
chair
and
run
to
his
unfortunate
master
he
was
now
standing
near
him
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
then
he
commenced
to
run
round
him
first
he
came
near
out
of
sympathy
then
he
retreated
out
of
fear
of
some
mysterious
danger
he
understood
perfectly
well
that
a
misfortune
had
taken
place
but
he
was
neither
thoughtful
nor
clever
enough
to
discover
what
it
was
hence
his
anxiety
his
fidelity
drew
him
to
his
suffering
friend
and
his
prudence
stopped
him
on
the
very
brink
of
the
fatal
spot
encouraged
at
length
by
the
calm
and
silence
which
eventually
reigned
he
licked
bergeret
s
neck
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
of
fear
and
of
love
the
fallen
master
smiled
and
the
dog
licked
the
end
of
his
nose
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
bergeret
who
freed
his
right
leg
stood
erect
and
limped
back
to
his
chair
riquet
was
there
before
him
all
that
could
be
seen
of
his
eyes
was
a
gleam
between
the
narrow
slit
of
the
lids
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
the
adventure
that
a
moment
before
had
so
stirred
them
both
the
little
creature
lived
in
the
present
with
no
thought
of
time
that
had
run
its
course
not
that
he
was
wanting
in
memory
inasmuch
as
he
could
remember
not
his
own
past
alone
but
the
past
of
his
ancestors
and
his
little
head
was
a
rich
storehouse
of
useful
knowledge
but
he
took
no
pleasure
in
remembrance
and
memory
was
not
for
him
as
it
was
for
bergeret
a
divine
muse
gently
stroking
the
short
smooth
coat
of
his
companion
bergeret
addressed
him
in
the
following
affectionate
terms
dog
at
the
price
of
the
repose
which
is
dear
to
your
heart
you
came
to
me
when
i
was
dismayed
and
brought
low
you
did
not
laugh
as
any
young
person
of
my
own
species
would
have
done
it
is
true
that
however
joyous
or
terrible
nature
may
appear
to
you
at
times
she
never
inspires
you
with
a
sense
of
the
ridiculous
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
because
of
your
innocent
gravity
that
you
are
the
surest
friend
a
man
can
have
in
the
first
instance
i
inspired
confidence
and
admiration
in
you
and
now
you
show
me
pity
dog
when
we
first
met
on
the
highway
of
life
we
came
from
the
two
poles
of
creation
we
belong
to
different
species
i
refer
to
this
with
no
desire
to
take
advantage
of
it
but
rather
with
a
strong
sense
of
universal
brotherhood
we
have
hardly
been
acquainted
two
hours
and
my
hand
has
never
yet
fed
you
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
the
obscure
love
for
me
that
has
sprung
up
in
your
little
heart
the
sympathy
you
bestow
on
me
is
a
charming
mystery
and
i
accept
it
sleep
friend
in
the
place
that
you
have
chosen
having
thus
spoken
bergeret
turned
over
the
leaves
of
ottfried
müller
s
which
with
marvellous
instinct
he
had
kept
in
his
hand
both
during
and
after
his
fall
he
turned
over
the
pages
and
could
not
find
what
he
sought
every
movement
however
seemed
to
increase
the
pain
he
was
feeling
i
believe
he
thought
that
the
whole
of
my
left
side
is
bruised
and
my
hip
swollen
i
have
a
suspicion
that
my
right
leg
is
grazed
all
over
and
my
left
elbow
aches
and
burns
but
shall
i
cavil
at
pain
that
has
led
me
to
the
discovery
of
a
friend
his
reflexions
were
running
thus
when
old
angélique
breathless
and
perspiring
entered
the
study
she
first
opened
the
door
and
then
she
knocked
for
she
never
permitted
herself
to
enter
without
knocking
if
she
had
not
done
so
before
she
opened
the
door
she
did
it
after
for
she
had
good
manners
and
knew
what
was
expected
of
her
she
went
in
therefore
knocked
and
said
monsieur
i
have
come
to
relieve
you
of
the
bergeret
heard
these
words
with
decided
annoyance
he
had
not
as
yet
inquired
into
his
claims
to
riquet
and
now
realized
that
he
had
none
the
thought
that
madame
borniche
might
take
the
animal
away
from
him
filled
him
with
sadness
yet
after
all

indifference
he
replied
he
s
asleep
let
him
sleep
where
is
he
i
don
t
see
him
remarked
old
angélique
here
he
is
answered
bergeret
in
my
with
her
two
hands
clasped
over
her
portly
figure
old
angélique
smiled
and
in
a
tone
of
gentle
mockery
ventured
i
wonder
what
pleasure
the
creature
can
find
in
sleeping
there
behind
monsieur
that
retorted
bergeret
is
his
then
as
he
was
of
an
inquiring
mind
he
immediately
sought
of
riquet
his
reasons
for
the
selection
of
his
and
lighting
on
them
replied
with
his
accustomed
candour
i
keep
him
warm
and
my
presence
affords
a
sense
of
security
my
comrade
is

chilly
and
homely

he

monsieur
leterrier
the
rector
who
was
of
an
arbitrary
turn
of
mind
and
whose
philosophy
leaned
towards
spiritualism
had
never
felt
much
sympathy
for
the
critical
intellect
of
bergeret
a
circumstance
memorable
enough
had
however
brought
them
together
leterrier
had
taken
part
in
the
affair
he
had
signed
a
protest
against
the
verdict
which
he
conscientiously
considered
illegal
and
mistaken
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
he
became
the
object
of
public
anger
and
contempt
the
town
which
numbered
inhabitants
only
contained
five
people
of
the
same
opinion
as
himself
with
regard
to
the
affair
these
were
bergeret
his
colleague
at
the
faculté
two
artillery
officers
and
eusèbe
boulet
the
two
officers
maintained
the
strictest
silence
on
the
subject
and
the
position
of
eusèbe
boulet
as
editor
of
the
compelled
him
to
express
daily
and
with
no
little
violence
ideas
which
were
contrary
to
his
convictions
to
rail
at
leterrier
and
hold
him
up
to
the
scorn
of
all
people
bergeret
had
written
a
letter
of
congratulation
to
his
rector
and
leterrier
called
upon
him
do
you
not
think
said
leterrier
that
truth
contains
a
power
that
renders
her
invincible
and
sooner
or
later
ensures
her
final
triumph
this
was
the
belief
of
the
great
ernest
renan
it
has
also
been
expressed
more
recently
in
words
worthy
to
be
engraved
in
it
is
precisely
what
i
personally
do
not
think
returned
bergeret
on
the
contrary
i
opine
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
truth
is
likely
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
disdain
or
insults
of
mankind
and
to
perish
in
obscurity
i
could
give
you
many
instances
of
this
remember
my
dear
sir
that
truth
has
so
many
points
of
inferiority
to
falsehood
as
practically
to
be
doomed
to
extinction
to
begin
with
truth
stands
alone
she
stands
alone
as
l
abbé
lantaigne
says
for
which
reason
he
admires
her
but
there
are
no
real
grounds
for
such
admiration
for
falsehood
is
manifold
and
so
truth
has
numbers
arrayed
against
her
that
is
not
her
only
shortcoming
she
is
inert
is
not
capable
of
modification
is
not
adapted
to
those
machinations
which
would
enable
her
to
win
her
way
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
men
falsehood
on
the
other
hand
possesses
the
most
wonderful
resources
she
is
pliant
and
tractable
and
what
is
more
we
must
not
shrink
from
admitting
as
much
she
is
natural
and
moral
she
is
natural
as
being
the
product
of
the
working
of
the
senses
the
source
and
of
all
illusion
she
is
moral
because
she
fits
in
with
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
human
race
who
living
in
common
as
they
do
founded
their
ideas
of
good
and
evil
their
human
and
divine
laws
upon
the
oldest
most
sacred
most
irrational
most
noble
most
barbarous
and
most
erroneous
interpretations
of
natural
phenomena
falsehood
is
the
principle
of
all
that
is
beautiful
and
of
good
report
amongst
men
do
we
not
see
winged
figures
and
mythical
pictures
adorning
their
gardens
their
palaces
and
their
temples
they
lend
a
willing
ear
only
to
the
lies
of
the
poets
what
makes
you
wish
to
destroy
falsehood
and
to
seek
truth
such
an
enterprise
can
only
be
inspired
by
decadent
curiosity
and
culpable
intellectual
temerity
it
is
an
attempt
against
the
moral
nature
of
man
and
the
laws
of
society
it
is
a
sin
against
the
sentiments
as
well
as
the
virtues
of
the
nations
the
growth
of
so
great
a
calamity
might
well
be
fatal
were
it
possible
to
precipitate
matters
in
that
direction
everything
would
go
to
rack
and
ruin
but
we
know
quite
well
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
progress
of
truth
is
very
slight
and
very
slow
and
encroaches
but
little
upon
you
are
evidently
not
here
referring
to
scientific
truths
said
leterrier
their
progress
is
rapid
irresistible
and
it
is
unfortunately
beyond
all
question
replied
bergeret
that
the
scientific
verities
which
penetrate
the
average
mind
sink
as
though
in
a
swamp
and
drown
they
cause
no
upheaval
and
are
powerless
to
destroy
error
and
prejudice
truths
of
the
laboratory
which
hold
sovereign
sway
over
you
and
me
monsieur
have
no
authority
over
the
minds
of
the
general
public
i
will
mention
one
example
only
to
prove
this
the
system
of
copernicus
and
galileo
is
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
christian
philosophy
and
yet
you
know
that
both
in
france
itself
and
the
world
over
it
has
penetrated
even
into
the
elementary
schools
without
the
very
smallest
modification
being
made
in
the
theological
conceptions
it
was
calculated
to
annihilate
it
is
certain
that
the
ideas
of
a
man
like
laplace
make
the
old
cosmogony
appear
as
puerile
as
the
painting
upon
the
dial
of
a
swiss
clock
and
yet
the
theories
of
laplace
have
been
clearly
exposed
for
nearly
a
century
without
in
the
least
depreciating
the
value
of
the
little
jewish
or
chaldean
legends
which
are
still
found
in
the
christian
books
on
religion
science
has
never
harmed
religion
and
the
absurdity
of
a
religious
practice
may
be
clearly
demonstrated
without
lessening
the
number
of
the
persons
who
indulge
in
it
scientific
truths
are
not
acceptable
to
the
public
nations
live
on
mythology
monsieur
from
legends
they
draw
all
the
ideas
necessary
to
their
existence
they
do
not
need
many
and
a
few
simple
fables
suffice
to
gild
millions
of
lives
in
short
truth
has
no
hold
on
mankind
and
it
would
be
a
pity
if
she
had
for
her
ways
are
contrary
to
their
nature
as
well
as
to
their
you
are
like
the
greeks
bergeret
said
leterrier
you
indulge
in
fine
sophisms
and
your
reasonings
are
tuned
to
the
flute
of
pan
and
yet
i
believe
with
renan
i
believe
with
émile
zola
that
truth
possesses
within
herself
a
penetrating
force
unknown
alike
to
error
and
to
falsehood
i
say
truth
and
you
understand
my
meaning
bergeret
for
the
beautiful
words
truth
and
justice
need
not
be
defined
in
order
to
be
understood
in
their
true
sense
they
bear
within
them
a
shining
beauty
and
a
heavenly
light
i
firmly
believe
in
the
triumph
of
truth
that
is
what
upholds
me
in
the
time
of
trial
through
which
i
am
now
and
may
you
be
right
monsieur
le
recteur
replied
bergeret
but
generally
speaking
i
think
that
the
knowledge
we
have
of
men
and
facts
seldom
corresponds
to
the
men
themselves
or
to
the
facts
accomplished
that
the
means
by
which
our
minds
can
attain
this
correspondence
are
incomplete
and
insufficient
and
that
if
time
reveals
new
ways
of
doing
so
it
destroys
more
than
it
produces
madame
roland
in
prison
displayed
to
my
mind
a
somewhat
childlike
trust
in
human
justice
when
she
appealed
with
so
firm
a
faith
and
so
confident
a
mind
to
impartial
posterity
posterity
is
never
impartial
unless
it
is
indifferent
and
what
ceases
to
interest
it
it
straightway
forgets
it
is
no
judge
as
madame
roland
fondly
believed
it
is
a
mob
as
blind
miserable
and
violent
as
any
other
it
has
its
likes
and
more
especially
its
dislikes
it
is
prejudiced
and
lives
in
the
present
knowing
nothing
of
the
past
there
is
no
such
thing
as
but
objected
leterrier
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
hour
of
justice
and
do
you
think
demanded
bergeret
that
the
hour
of
justice
and
reparation
ever
sounded
for
macbeth
macbeth
yes
macbeth
son
of
finleg
king
of
scotland
two
great
powers
legend
and
shakespeare
have
made
of
him
a
criminal
now
i
am
convinced
monsieur
that
he
was
a
most
excellent
man
he
protected
the
people
and
the
clergy
against
the
violence
of
the
nobles
he
was
a
thrifty
king
a
just
judge
and
the
friend
of
the
working
classes
history
bears
witness
to
it
he
did
not
murder
king
duncan
his
wife
was
not
a
wicked
woman
she
was
called
gruoch
and
had
three
vendettas
against
the
family
of
malcolm
her
first
husband
had
been
burned
alive
in
his
castle
i
have
here
on
my
table
an
english
review
containing
materials
which
prove
the
goodness
of
macbeth
and
the
innocence
of
his
wife
do
you
think
that
if
i
were
to
publish
these
proofs
i
should
succeed
in
altering
public
opinion
i
do
not
think
so
replied
leterrier
neither
do
i
said
bergeret
with
a
sigh
at
this
moment
a
great
clamour
arose
from
the
some
citizens
actuated
by
zeal
for
the
army
and
in
conformity
with
their
recently
formed
custom
were
on
their
way
to
break
the
windows
of
meyer
the
bootmaker
à
zola
mort
à
leterrier
mort
à
bergeret
mort
aux
juifs
they
shouted
and
as
the
rector
gave
way
to
some
symptoms
of
distress
and
indignation
bergeret
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
must
try
and
comprehend
the
enthusiasm
of
mobs
such
as
this
one
these
people
he
said
are
going
to
break
the
windows
of
a
bootmaker
and
will
succeed
in
doing
so
without
any
trouble
do
you
think
they
would
be
as
successful
if
for
instance
they
had
to
put
in
windows
or
bells
at
general
cartier
de
chalmot
s
no
indeed
popular
enthusiasm
is
never
constructive
but
on
the
contrary
essentially
destructive
this
time
it
aims
at
our
destruction
you
must
not
attach
too
much
importance
to
this
particular
instance
but
rather
seek
out
the
laws
which
govern
no
doubt
replied
leterrier
who
was
frankness
personified
but
all
the
same
these
events
fill
me
with
consternation
can
we
callously
look
on
at
the
overthrow
of
justice
and
truth
by
a
people
from
whom
europe
first
learned
the
law
and
who
taught
the
meaning
of
justice
to
the
whole
world
chapter

monsieur
le
premier
président
cassignol
died
in
his
year
and
in
accordance
with
his
expressed
wish
was
carried
to
his
grave
upon
a
pauper
s
hearse
this
clause
in
his
will
was
silently
condemned
all
present
were
inwardly
offended
as
though
the
injunction
were
intended
as
a
slur
upon
that
object
of
universal
respect
money
and
as
the
ostentatious
relinquishment
of
a
privilege
appertaining
to
the
bourgeois
class
they
called
to
mind
that
cassignol
had
always
lived
in
very
good
style
observing
even
in
extreme
old
age
a
punctilious
nicety
with
regard
to
his
personal
habits
and
although
he
had
been
unceasingly
employed
in
charitable
works
none
would
ever
have
dreamed
of
saying
in
the
words
of
a
christian
orator
he
loved
the
poor
even
to
becoming
as
one
of
they
did
not
believe
the
thing
was
done
out
of
religious
zeal
and
looked
upon
it
as
a
paradoxical
piece
of
pride
the
elaborate
display
of
humility
being
received
with
the
utmost
coldness
they
regretted
too
that
the
deceased
who
had
been
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
had
directed
that
no
military
honours
should
be
paid
him
the
state
of
the
public
mind
inflamed
by
the
nationalist
papers
was
such
that
open
complaints
at
the
absence
of
the
military
were
heard
among
the
crowd
general
cartier
de
chalmot
who
came
in
civilian
attire
was
greeted
with
profound
respect
by
a
deputation
of
lawyers
a
great
number
of
magistrates
and
clergy
thronged
around
the
house
of
mourning
and
when
preceded
by
the
cross
and
to
the
sound
of
bells
and
liturgical
chants
the
hearse
moved
slowly
towards
the
cathedral
accompanied
by
twelve
nuns
and
followed
by
a
long
grey
and
black
line
of
boys
and
girls
from
the
church
schools
which
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
meaning
of
this
long
life
entirely
consecrated
to
the
triumph
of
the
catholic
church
was
at
once
revealed
the
whole
town
was
there
bergeret
was
among
the
stragglers
following
the
procession
and
mazure
coming
up
to
him
whispered
in
his
ear
i
knew
that
old
cassignol
had
been
a
fanatical
zealot
all
his
life
but
i
didn
t
know
he
was
such
a
prig
he
called
himself
a
liberal
and
so
he
was
answered
bergeret
he
had
to
be
because
his
ambition
was
to
govern
is
it
not
through
liberty
that
we
progress
along
the
road
to
domination
my
dear
mazure
i
am
indeed
sorry
for
you
why
asked
the
keeper
of
the
records
because
being
in
sympathy
with
the
mob
you
constantly
display
the
same
pathetic
faculty
for
being
deceived
and
zealously
march
along
in
the
procession
of
triumphant
oh
if
you
mean
the
affair
replied
mazure
i
may
as
well
warn
you
that
we
shall
not
agree
at
bergeret
do
you
know
that
parson
inquired
fornerol
glancing
at
a
fat
and
agile
priest
who
was
sidling
in
among
the
crowd
abbé
guitrel
exclaimed
bergeret
who
does
not
know
of
guitrel
and
his
servant
adventures
recounted
in
days
of
yore
by
la
fontaine
and
boccaccio
are
attributed
to
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
abbé
s
servant
is
of
the
age
stipulated
by
the
canons
of
the
church
a
little
while
ago
this
priest
who
will
soon
be
a
bishop
said
something
which
was
retailed
to
me
and
which
i
in
turn
repeat
to
you
he
said
if
the
eighteenth
century
may
be
called
the
century
of
crime
perhaps
the
nineteenth
will
be
spoken
of
as
the
century
of
what
do
you
think
of
that
suppose
guitrel
were
no
replied
the
keeper
of
the
records
the
number
of
the
emancipated
increases
from
day
to
day
and
liberty
of
conscience
has
been
set
up
once
for
all
the
empire
of
science
has
been
established
i
am
not
however
without
some
fears
of
a
renewed
attack
by
the
clerical
party
present
circumstances
favouring
reaction
it
really
worries
me
for
i
am
not
like
you
a
dilettante
i
have
a
fierce
and
anxious
love
for
the
chatting
thus
they
reached
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
cathedral
over
the
heads
of
the
people
bald
black
or
hoary
the
swell
of
the
organ
and
the
odour
of
incense
were
wafted
through
the
great
open
doors
from
the
warm
twilight
within
i
m
not
going
inside
said
mazure
i
will
go
in
for
a
few
minutes
said
bergeret
i
have
a
taste
for
as
he
entered
the
was
rolling
out
its
spacious
phrases
bergeret
was
behind
on
the
gospel
side
in
the
part
reserved
for
women
sat
madame
de
gromance
in
her
black
garments
her
eyes
void
of
all
thought
which
only
made
her
all
the
more
desirable
in
bergeret
s
mind
the
cantor
s
voice
rang
out
in
the
great
nave
singing
a
verse
of
the
funeral
chant
qui
latronem
exaudisti
et
mariam
absolvisti
mihi
quoque
spem
you
hear
fornerol
said
bergeret
latronem
thou
who
didst
pardon
the
thief
and
absolve
the
adulteress
hast
given
hope
to
me
no
doubt
the
recital
of
such
words
to
a
large
assembly
of
people
is
not
without
its
impressive
side
and
the
praise
is
due
to
those
untutored
and
gentle
visionaries
of
the
abruzzi
those
humble
servants
of
the
poor
those
amiable
enthusiasts
who
renounced
riches
in
order
to
escape
from
the
hatred
and
that
they
engender
they
were
bad
economists
these
companions
of
francis
méline
would
show
his
contempt
for
them
if
by
any
chance
he
ever
heard
them
spoken
ah
said
the
doctor
the
companions
of
francis
were
able
to
look
ahead
and
to
see
of
what
material
an
assembly
such
as
this
of
would
be
i
believe
the
was
written
during
the
thirteenth
century
in
a
franciscan
convent
replied
bergeret
i
must
consult
my
friend
commander
aspertini
on
the
in
the
meanwhile
the
burial
service
was
drawing
to
a
close
while
they
followed
the
hearse
that
bore
the
magistrate
s
remains
to
the
cemetery
mazure
fornerol
and
bergeret
continued
their
conversation
as
they
were
passing
the
house
of
queen
marguerite
mazure
remarked
the
agreement
is
signed
de
terremondre
is
owner
of
the
ancient
dwelling
of
philippe
tricouillard
and
intends
to
house
his
collection
there
in
the
secret
hope
of
selling
it
at
a
tremendous
price
some
day
to
the
town
whose
benefactor
he
will
thus
become
by
the
way
terremondre
has
made
up
his
mind
he
is
going
to
offer
himself
as
progressive
republican
candidate
for
seuilly
but
every
one
knows
in
what
direction
his
progress
will
tend
he
is
a
turncoat
from
the
hasn
t
he
got
the
government
behind
him
asked
bergeret
he
is
supported
by
the
and
opposed
by
the
replied
mazure
the
of
seuilly
is
led
by
the
president
of
the
council
and
the
acts
upon
the
instructions
of
the
minister
of
the
do
you
see
that
shop
asked
the
doctor
the
dyer
s
and
cleaner
s
shop
that
belongs
to
the
widow
leborgne
said
mazure
yes
replied
fornerol
her
husband
died
six
weeks
ago
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
he
literally
died
of
fright
and
nervous
shock
at
sight
of
a
dog
which
he
believed
to
be
mad
and
which
was
as
healthy
as
i
am
at
the
thought
of
death
mazure
who
was
a
freethinker
felt
a
sudden
longing
come
over
him
to
possess
an
immortal
soul
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
what
is
taught
by
the
different
churches
that
share
in
the
spiritual
guidance
of
the
people
he
said
i
know
none
better
how
dogma
is
formed
transformed
and
elaborated
but
why
should
we
not
possess
a
thinking
principle
and
why
should
not
that
principle
survive
the
association
of
organic
elements
that
we
call
life
i
should
like
replied
bergeret
to
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
a
thinking
principle
but
no
doubt
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
not
at
all
returned
mazure
i
give
the
name
to
the
cause
of
thought
or
if
you
prefer
it
to
thought
itself
why
should
not
thought
be
immortal
yes
why
not
returned
bergeret
the
supposition
is
by
no
means
absurd
said
mazure
warming
to
his
subject
and
why
returned
bergeret
should
not
a
certain
house
in
the
tintelleries
bearing
the
number
be
inhabited
by
a
dupont
such
a
supposition
is
by
no
means
absurd
the
name
of
dupont
is
common
enough
in
france
and
the
house
of
which
i
am
speaking
is
divided
into
three
now
of
course
you
re
joking
said
mazure
in
a
way
i
m
a
spiritualist
said
fornerol
spiritualism
is
a
therapeutic
agent
which
must
be
reckoned
with
in
the
present
state
of
medical
science
all
my
patients
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
dislike
hearing
it
ridiculed
the
good
people
of
the
tintelleries
quarter
and
elsewhere
insist
on
being
immortal
and
it
would
grieve
and
wound
them
if
anyone
were
to
suggest
anything
to
the
contrary
madame
péchin
to
wit
coming
out
of
the
greengrocer
s
over
there
with
a
basketful
of
tomatoes
if
you
were
to
go
to
her
and
say
madame
péchin
you
will
taste
the
joys
of
heaven
for
hundreds
of
millions
of
centuries
but
you
are
not
immortal
you
will
live
longer
than
the
stars
you
will
still
exist
when
the
nebulæ
have
turned
into
suns
and
after
the
light
of
those
suns
has
died
you
will
live
on
in
perfect
happiness
and
glory
during
inconceivable
ages
but
you
are
not
immortal
madame
péchin
if
you
were
to
say
such
things
to
her
she
would
not
look
upon
them
as
good
tidings
and
if
by
chance
your
words
were
backed
up
by
proofs
infallible
enough
to
convince
her
she
would
be
miserable
the
poor
old
thing
would
be
in
despair
and
would
mingle
tears
with
her
tomatoes
madame
péchin
insists
on
being
immortal
all
my
patients
have
a
similar
craving
you
mazure
and
you
too
bergeret
have
the
same
desire
now
i
will
confess
to
you
that
instability
is
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
combined
elements
that
go
to
form
life
shall
i
give
you
a
scientific
definition
of
life
it
s
a
damned
callous
mystery
confucius
said
bergeret
was
a
very
sensible
man
one
day
his
disciple
asked
him
how
to
serve
the
demons
and
the
spirits
to
which
the
master
replied
man
is
not
yet
in
a
fit
state
to
serve
humanity
so
how
can
he
serve
the
demons
and
the
spirits
permit
me
went
on
the
disciple
to
ask
you
what
is
and
confucius
replied
we
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
life
how
then
can
we
understand
death
the
procession
skirted
the
rue
nationale
and
passed
in
front
of
the
college
fornerol
being
thereby
reminded
of
his
youthful
days
began
that
is
where
i
studied
it
is
a
long
time
ago
now
i
am
much
older
than
either
of
you
in
a
week
i
shall
be
and
so
madame
péchin
really
insists
on
being
immortal
asked
bergeret
she
is
convinced
that
she
is
immortal
answered
the
doctor
if
you
told
her
that
she
was
not
she
would
take
a
dislike
to
you
and
disbelieve
you
all
the
and
the
idea
of
having
to
go
on
for
ever
amid
the
universal
passing
of
things
does
not
astonish
her
she
does
not
tire
of
nourishing
such
exaggerated
hopes
perhaps
she
has
not
given
much
thought
to
the
nature
of
man
and
the
conditions
of
life
what
does
that
matter
replied
the
doctor
i
can
not
understand
your
surprise
my
dear
bergeret
this
good
lady
is
a
religious
woman
religion
indeed
is
her
only
possession
having
been
born
in
a
catholic
country
she
is
a
catholic
and
she
believes
what
she
has
been
taught
it
s
only
nature
doctor
you
are
talking
like
zaïre
said
bergeret
had
i
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
besides
the
belief
in
immortality
is
common
in
europe
america
and
a
part
of
asia
it
spreads
in
africa
with
the
wearing
of
so
much
the
better
replied
the
doctor
for
it
is
necessary
to
civilization
without
it
the
unfortunate
would
never
resign
themselves
to
their
yet
retorted
bergeret
the
chinese
coolies
work
for
paltry
wages
they
are
patient
and
resigned
and
they
are
not
that
is
because
they
are
yellow
replied
the
doctor
the
white
races
have
far
less
resignation
they
have
conceived
an
ideal
of
justice
and
formed
great
hopes
general
cartier
de
chalmot
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
belief
in
a
future
life
is
necessary
to
an
army
it
is
also
very
useful
with
regard
to
social
intercourse
people
would
be
worse
than
they
are
but
for
the
fear
of
doctor
demanded
bergeret
do
you
believe
you
will
rise
again
it
s
different
for
me
replied
the
doctor
i
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
believe
in
god
in
order
to
be
an
honest
man
as
a
scientist
i
know
nothing
as
a
citizen
i
believe
everything
i
am
a
catholic
by
policy
and
consider
that
religious
belief
is
essentially
an
improving
element
that
helps
to
humanize
the
that
is
a
very
widespread
opinion
said
bergeret
and
its
general
acceptance
renders
it
suspect
in
my
eyes
popular
opinions
hold
good
as
a
matter
of
course
without
analysis
and
if
they
were
inquired
into
generally
speaking
they
would
not
pass
muster
they
are
like
the
who
for
thirty
years
was
able
to
attend
the
plays
at
the
by
simply
muttering
feu
scribe
as
he
went
in
to
the
man
at
the
if
investigated
his
right
of
entry
would
never
have
been
allowed
to
pass
but
it
never
was
investigated
how
can
one
really
believe
religion
to
have
a
moralizing
effect
when
one
reads
the
history
of
the
christian
nations
and
realizes
it
to
be
a
succession
of
wars
massacres
and
tortures
you
can
not
expect
people
to
be
more
pious
than
cloistered
monks
and
yet
monks
of
every
order
black
white
brown
and
pied
have
been
guilty
of
the
most
abominable
crimes
the
agents
of
the
inquisition
and
the
priests
of
the
league
were
pious
yet
they
were
cruel
i
do
not
mention
the
popes
who
drowned
the
world
in
blood
for
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
they
really
believed
in
a
future
life
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
men
are
evil
animals
and
remain
evil
even
when
they
expect
to
go
from
this
world
into
another
which
is
somewhat
unreasonable
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
all
the
same
i
do
not
want
you
to
imagine
doctor
that
i
deny
madame
péchin
the
right
to
believe
herself
immortal
i
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
will
not
be
disappointed
when
she
departs
this
life
for
a
lasting
illusion
has
some
of
the
attributes
of
truth
and
a
person
who
is
never
disabused
is
never
by
this
time
the
head
of
the
cortège
had
entered
the
cemetery
and
the
three
gossips
slackened
their
pace
if
you
were
in
my
position
bergeret
said
the
doctor
and
visited
each
morning
a
dozen
or
so
of
sick
folk
you
would
realize
as
i
do
the
power
of
the
clergy
come
now
do
you
never
find
yourself
desiring
if
not
believing
in
immortality
doctor
replied
bergeret
my
thoughts
on
this
subject
are
the
same
as
those
of
madame
madame
was
very
old
when
my
father
was
very
young
she
was
fond
of
him
and
used
to
enjoy
a
chat
with
him
she
was
a
link
with
the
eighteenth
century
i
have
heard
him
quote
her
again
and
again
and
this
amongst
others
is
an
anecdote
i
have
heard
him
relate
once
when
she
was
ill
in
the
country
her
parish
priest
went
to
visit
her
and
began
to
talk
of
a
future
life
with
a
little
disdainful
grimace
she
retorted
that
she
had
her
misgivings
about
the
next
world
you
tell
me
she
said
that
the
creator
of
this
world
made
the
next
too
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
already
too
well
acquainted
with
his
handiwork
thus
doctor
i
am
at
least
as
mistrustful
of
the
next
world
as
was
madame
but
asked
the
doctor
have
you
never
dreamed
of
immortality
achieved
by
science
or
life
on
another
star
i
always
come
back
to
the
saying
of
madame
replied
bergeret
i
should
be
too
much
afraid
that
the
systems
of
altair
or
aldebaran
would
resemble
our
solar
system
and
that
it
would
not
be
worth
while
changing
and
as
for
being
born
again
on
this
terrestrial
globe
i
think
not
doctor
thank
you
but
come
now
really
persisted
the
doctor
would
you
not
like
madame
péchin
like
to
be
immortal
somehow
or
other
all
things
considered
replied
bergeret
i
am
content
with
being
eternal
and
in
my
essence
i
am
that
as
for
the
consciousness
i
enjoy
that
is
a
mere
accident
doctor
a
momentary
phenomenon
like
a
bubble
formed
on
the
surface
of
the
agreed
but
it
is
better
not
to
say
so
replied
the
doctor
why
asked
bergeret
because
such
notions
are
not
suited
to
the
masses
with
whom
you
must
agree
outwardly
though
inwardly
you
hold
other
views
it
is
community
of
belief
that
makes
strong
the
truth
is
replied
bergeret
that
men
of
a
common
faith
have
no
more
urgent
desire
than
to
exterminate
those
who
think
differently
particularly
if
the
difference
is
very
we
are
going
to
hear
three
speeches
said
mazure
he
was
mistaken
five
speeches
were
made
and
no
one
heard
a
word
cries
of
l
armée
broke
out
as
general
cartier
de
chalmot
went
by
while
messieurs
leterrier
and
bergeret
were
pursued
by
the
hooting
of
the
youthful
nationalists
of
the
place
chapter
ix
on
a
wet
evening
in
may
the
brécé
ladies
were
sitting
together
in
the
big
knitting
woollen
bodices
for
the
poor
children
of
the
village
old
madame
de
courtrai
was
standing
with
her
back
to
the
fire
holding
up
her
skirts
and
warming
her
legs
the
duke
general
cartier
de
chalmot
and
lerond
were
chatting
prior
to
a
game
of
whist
the
duke
opened
the
previous
day
s
paper
that
was
lying
upon
the
table
hostilities
between
the
americans
and
the
spanish
have
not
yet
started
in
earnest
he
said
what
do
you
anticipate
will
be
the
outcome
of
it
all
general
i
should
be
very
glad
to
have
the
opinion
of
so
eminent
a
military
authority
as
it
would
certainly
be
very
instructive
if
you
would
tell
us
what
you
think
about
the
forces
that
are
about
to
try
their
strength
in
the
antilles
and
in
the
china
seas
general
put
in
lerond
general
cartier
de
chalmot
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
opened
his
mouth
some
time
before
he
spoke
and
then
said
in
an
authoritative
manner
the
americans
have
committed
a
very
imprudent
act
in
declaring
war
on
spain
and
it
may
well
cost
them
dear
having
no
army
and
no
navy
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
for
them
to
keep
up
a
struggle
against
an
efficient
army
and
a
navy
they
have
their
stokers
and
their
enginemen
but
stokers
and
enginemen
do
not
make
a
battle
do
you
think
the
spaniards
will
win
general
asked
lerond
generally
speaking
the
success
of
a
campaign
depends
upon
circumstances
impossible
to
prophesy
replied
the
general
but
it
may
at
once
be
stated
that
the
americans
are
not
ready
for
war
and
war
necessitates
long
and
careful
come
general
cried
madame
de
courtrai
tell
us
that
these
american
wretches
will
be
beaten
their
success
is
doubtful
replied
the
general
i
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
would
be
paradoxical
and
an
insolent
contradiction
of
every
system
employed
by
those
nations
which
are
essentially
military
nations
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
victory
of
the
united
states
would
constitute
a
condemnation
of
the
principles
adopted
throughout
europe
by
the
most
competent
soldiers
and
such
a
result
is
neither
likely
nor
good
cried
madame
de
courtrai
smacking
her
withered
sides
with
her
bony
hands
and
shaking
her
head
with
its
rough
grey
locks
that
looked
like
a
fur
cap
good
our
friends
the
spaniards
will
be
victorious
le
roi
general
said
lerond
i
am
most
interested
in
what
you
say
the
success
of
our
friends
would
be
well
received
in
france
and
who
knows
if
they
might
not
be
the
means
of
stirring
up
a
royalist
and
clerical
movement
in
this
country
pardon
me
said
the
general
i
make
no
prophecy
regarding
the
future
as
i
have
said
before
the
success
of
a
campaign
depends
upon
circumstances
impossible
to
foresee
all
i
can
do
is
to
take
into
consideration
the
quality
of
the
conflicting
elements
and
from
this
point
of
view
the
advantage
is
certainly
with
spain
although
her
fleet
does
not
include
a
sufficiency
of
naval
certain
symptoms
said
the
duke
would
point
to
the
fact
that
the
americans
have
already
begun
to
repent
of
their
temerity
i
have
heard
it
positively
stated
that
they
are
they
live
in
daily
dread
of
seeing
the
spanish
ironclads
appear
on
their
coasts
the
inhabitants
of
boston
new
york
and
philadelphia
are
fleeing
inland
in
fact
a
general
panic
le
roi
repeated
madame
de
courtrai
with
fierce
delight
what
about
little
honorine
asked
lerond
is
she
still
favoured
with
the
visitations
of
yes
replied
the
dowager
duchess
with
some
embarrassment
it
would
be
a
good
idea
ventured
the
to
make
an
official
report
of
the
child
s
statements
of
what
she
sees
and
hears
when
in
her
no
reply
was
forthcoming
to
this
remark
the
reason
being
that
having
undertaken
to
note
down
the
words
attributed
by
honorine
to
the
blessed
virgin
madame
de
brécé
very
soon
stopped
doing
so
the
child
s
expressions
were
not
nice
besides
le
curé
traviès
who
was
in
the
habit
of
shooting
rabbits
every
evening
in
the
woods
of
lénonville
had
too
often
surprised
isidore
and
honorine
lying
among
the
dead
leaves
to
be
any
longer
in
doubt
as
to
why
they
were
there
traviès
was
something
of
a
poacher
but
both
his
morals
and
his
doctrine
were
sound
he
gathered
from
repeated
observations
that
it
was
hardly
likely
the
blessed
virgin
would
appear
to
honorine
he
had
spoken
on
the
matter
to
the
ladies
of
the
castle
who
were
if
not
convinced
at
least
somewhat
perplexed
so
when
lerond
asked
them
for
details
of
the
latest
ecstasies
they
changed
the
subject
if
you
care
to
hear
news
from
lourdes
said
the
dowager
duchess
we
have
my
nephew
writes
me
that
many
miracles
take
place
in
the
grotto
said
de
brécé
i
have
heard
the
same
thing
from
one
of
my
officers
replied
the
general
he
is
a
promising
young
fellow
and
has
come
back
amazed
at
the
wonderful
things
he
saw
you
know
that
the
doctors
in
attendance
at
the
piscina
report
the
most
miraculous
cures
said
the
duke
we
do
not
need
the
opinion
of
learned
men
to
make
us
believe
in
miracles
said
madame
de
brécé
with
a
limpid
smile
i
have
far
more
confidence
in
the
blessed
virgin
than
in
any
they
then
began
to
talk
of
the
affair
amazed
so
they
said
that
the
syndicate
of
treachery
should
continue
its
audacious
manifestations
unpunished
with
much
emphasis
the
duke
expressed
himself
as
follows
when
two
courts
martial
have
given
their
verdict
the
smallest
doubt
can
no
longer
have
you
heard
said
madame
jean
that
mademoiselle
deniseau
the
local
prophetess
has
learned
from
the
mouth
of
radegonde
herself
that
zola
is
going
to
become
a
naturalized
italian
and
will
not
return
to
france
this
prophecy
was
received
with
much
favour
a
servant
entered
bringing
the
letters
perhaps
there
will
be
some
news
of
the
war
said
the
duke
opening
a
paper
and
in
dead
silence
he
read
the
following
commodore
dewey
has
destroyed
the
spanish
fleet
in
the
port
of
manilla
the
americans
have
not
lost
a
this
telegram
caused
much
depression
in
the
the
only
person
who
continued
to
look
confident
was
madame
de
courtrai
who
cried
it
s
not
true
the
telegram
said
lerond
is
an
american
yes
said
de
brécé
we
must
beware
of
false
all
endorsed
this
prudent
view
of
things
and
yet
were
aghast
at
the
sudden
vision
of
a
fleet
blessed
by
the
pope
bearing
the
flag
of
his
catholic
majesty
and
carrying
on
the
prow
of
her
vessels
the
names
of
the
virgin
and
the
saints
disabled
shattered
and
sunk
by
the
guns
of
bacon
merchants
manufacturers
and
heretics
by
a
nation
without
kings
without
princes
without
a
history
without
national
traditions
and
without
an
army
chapter
x
bergeret
s
affairs
were
worrying
him
he
was
beginning
to
fear
he
might
be
asked
to
resign
his
position
at
the
faculté
when
to
his
surprise
he
received
the
intimation
that
he
had
been
appointed
honorary
professor
there
the
news
came
to
him
one
day
after
his
removal
to
his
new
rooms
in
the
place
at
the
very
moment
when
he
least
expected
it
his
joy
at
the
event
was
greater
than
his
progress
in
ataraxy
should
have
allowed
vague
and
flattering
hopes
arose
within
him
and
when
goubin
who
had
become
his
favourite
pupil
since
the
betrayal
of
roux
came
that
same
evening
to
take
him
for
their
usual
stroll
to
the
café
de
la
comédie
he
found
him
beaming
all
over
with
smiles
the
night
was
bright
with
stars
and
as
he
went
along
the
uneven
pavements
bergeret
studied
the
sky
he
was
interested
in
the
lighter
side
of
astronomy
and
pointed
out
to
goubin
a
beautiful
red
star
over
against
gemini
that
is
mars
he
said
i
wish
there
were
such
things
as
glasses
strong
enough
to
see
its
inhabitants
and
their
but
dear
master
said
goubin
were
you
not
telling
me
some
short
time
ago
that
the
planet
mars
was
not
inhabited
that
none
of
the
celestial
bodies
were
inhabited
and
that
life
such
as
we
conceive
it
was
a
disease
confined
to
our
planet
alone
a
kind
of
decay
spread
over
the
surface
of
our
rotting
world
did
i
say
that
asked
bergeret
as
far
as
i
can
remember
that
is
what
you
said
dear
master
replied
goubin
and
his
memory
had
not
played
him
false
after
the
betrayal
of
roux
bergeret
had
asserted
that
organic
life
was
but
decay
eating
into
the
surface
of
our
diseased
world
he
had
also
added
that
he
hoped
for
the
greater
glory
of
the
heavens
that
life
in
the
distant
worlds
produced
itself
normally
by
means
of
the
geometrical
forms
of
crystallization
otherwise
he
had
added
i
could
derive
no
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
the
now
however
he
was
of
a
different
opinion
you
surprise
me
he
said
to
goubin
there
are
several
reasons
for
concluding
that
all
those
stars
now
sparkling
overhead
contain
life
and
thought
even
on
this
earth
of
ours
life
occasionally
has
its
pleasant
side
and
thought
is
divine
i
should
much
like
to
know
something
about
yon
sister
star
floating
in
thin
ether
in
the
face
of
the
sun
she
is
our
neighbour
and
only
separated
from
us
by
fourteen
millions
of
leagues
which
astronomically
speaking
is
a
very
small
distance
indeed
i
should
like
to
know
if
the
living
beings
upon
the
planet
mars
are
more
beautiful
than
we
humans
are
and
whether
their
intellect
is
vaster
than
our
that
is
a
thing
we
shall
never
know
replied
goubin
wiping
his
glasses
at
any
rate
went
on
bergeret
astronomers
have
studied
the
shape
of
that
red
planet
by
means
of
powerful
telescopes
and
they
all
agree
in
saying
that
they
are
able
to
distinguish
innumerable
canals
upon
its
surface
now
the
hypotheses
taken
as
a
whole
hypotheses
that
are
closely
interdependent
and
form
a
great
cosmic
system
lead
us
to
believe
that
this
near
neighbour
of
ours
is
older
than
the
earth
from
which
we
may
deduce
that
her
inhabitants
with
a
longer
experience
behind
them
are
wiser
than
ourselves
the
canals
of
which
i
was
speaking
give
to
the
huge
tracts
of
land
they
traverse
the
appearance
of
lombardy
to
be
quite
correct
we
can
see
neither
the
water
nor
the
banks
but
only
the
vegetation
that
grows
along
them
and
which
to
the
observer
appears
as
a
thin
scattered
line
pale
or
dark
according
to
the
season
of
the
year
it
is
especially
to
be
remarked
at
the
equator
of
the
planet
we
give
the
canals
the
earthly
names
of
ganges
euripus
phison
nile
and
orcus
they
appear
to
be
irrigating
canals
like
those
at
which
it
is
said
leonardo
da
vinci
worked
with
the
skill
of
an
excellent
engineer
their
undeviating
course
and
the
circular
basins
in
which
they
terminate
are
sufficient
proof
that
they
are
both
artificial
and
the
result
of
mathematical
calculation
nature
is
mathematical
it
is
true
but
not
in
the
same
manner
the
canal
which
we
call
orcus
is
very
wonderful
its
course
lies
through
a
number
of
little
round
lakes
set
at
equal
distances
from
one
another
which
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
rosary
we
can
not
doubt
but
that
the
canals
of
mars
have
been
constructed
by
intelligent
thus
did
bergeret
people
the
universe
with
seductive
forms
and
sublime
thoughts
he
filled
the
empty
spaces
of
the
boundless
heavens
because
he
had
been
made
an
honorary
professor
he
was
very
wise
but
also
very
human
when
he
returned
home
he
found
the
following
letter
awaiting
him
milan
dear
friend
you
have
relied
too
much
upon
my
knowledge
i
am
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
which
you
tell
me
stirred
you
during
the
funeral
of
cassignol
the
only
interest
i
have
taken
in
the
old
church
liturgies
lies
in
their
connection
in
one
way
and
another
with
the
writings
of
dante
and
i
can
tell
you
nothing
upon
the
subject
that
you
do
not
already
know
the
oldest
mention
of
the
chant
is
made
about
by
bartolommeo
pisano
maroni
attributes
the
to
frangipani
malabranca
orsini
who
was
cardinal
in
wadding
the
biographer
of
the
franciscan
order
séraphique
ascribes
it
to
fra
tomaso
da
celano
floruit
sub
such
attributions
are
altogether
destitute
of
proof
but
it
is
at
any
rate
probable
that
it
was
composed
in
italy
during
the
twelfth
century
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
defective
text
of
the
roman
missal
was
further
impaired
a
marble
tablet
preserved
in
the
church
of
san
francesco
at
mantua
offers
an
older
and
more
perfect
version
of
the
poem
if
you
would
like
me
to
do
so
i
will
have
the
copied
for
you
i
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
make
use
of
me
in
this
as
in
other
ways
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
to
be
able
to
serve
you
in
return
please
be
good
enough
to
copy
for
me
a
letter
written
by
mabillon
and
preserved
in
the
town
library
it
is
one
of
the
joliette
bequest
collection
b
no
folio
the
passage
that
particularly
interests
me
refers
to
the
of
muratori
coming
from
you
i
shall
value
it
still
more
it
is
my
opinion
by
the
way
that
muratori
did
not
believe
in
god
it
has
always
been
my
wish
to
write
a
book
on
the
the
number
of
whom
is
considerable
forgive
me
for
the
trouble
to
which
i
am
putting
you
by
asking
you
to
visit
the
public
library
i
trust
that
you
may
be
rewarded
by
a
meeting
with
the
fairy
who
guards
the
entrance
and
whose
dainty
ears
listen
to
your
flattering
remarks
the
while
she
swings
in
her
fingers
the
huge
keys
that
lock
away
the
ancient
treasures
of
your
town
speaking
of
this
fairy
reminds
me
that
my
days
of
love
are
over
and
that
it
is
high
time
for
me
to
cultivate
some
favourite
vice
life
would
be
sad
indeed
if
the
rosy
swarm
of
errant
thoughts
did
not
come
sometimes
to
console
the
old
age
of
the
most
respectable
folk
i
am
safe
in
sharing
such
sound
wisdom
with
a
mind
as
rare
and
capable
of
comprehension
as
your
own
when
you
come
to
florence
i
will
introduce
you
to
a
nymph
who
guards
the
house
of
dante
and
who
is
well
worth
your
fairy
you
will
admire
her
chestnut
hair
her
black
eyes
her
full
bust
and
her
nose
you
will
consider
a
miracle
of
loveliness
it
is
of
medium
size
straight
and
fine
with
delicate
nostrils
i
mention
this
particularly
because
you
know
that
nature
is
not
good
at
noses
and
too
often
spoils
a
pretty
face
by
her
clumsiness
in
that
direction
mabillon
s
letter
which
i
have
asked
you
to
copy
for
me
commences
thus
ni
les
fatigues
de
l
âge
monsieur
forgive
me
for
worrying
you
and
believe
me
to
be
your
sincere
friend
carlo
aspertini
why
will
the
french
persist
in
upholding
an
error
of
justice
which
is
now
beyond
all
question
and
which
they
could
quite
easily
set
right
without
harming
anyone
i
can
find
no
solution
to
their
conduct
in
this
matter
all
my
countrymen
all
europe
and
the
whole
world
share
my
amazement
i
should
very
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
regarding
this
extraordinary
c
chapter
xi
in
the
clear
light
of
early
morning
the
quarters
were
full
of
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
men
on
duty
sweeping
the
cobbles
or
grooming
down
the
horses
at
the
far
end
of
the
yard
clothed
in
his
canvas
trousers
and
dirty
blouse
stood
private
bonmont
with
his
comrades
privates
cocot
and
briqueballe
peeling
potatoes
in
front
of
a
cauldron
full
of
water
now
and
then
a
squad
under
the
conduct
of
a
officer
rushed
down
the
stairs
like
a
torrent
scattering
on
its
way
the
invincible
gaiety
of
the
young
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
these
men
who
had
been
taught
to
march
was
their
step
a
heavy
laboured
step
crushing
and
sonorous
continually
passed
by
with
of
all
sizes
under
their
arms
privates
bonmont
cocot
and
briqueballe
were
peeling
potatoes
and
throwing
them
into
the
cauldron
and
as
they
did
so
they
gave
vent
to
the
most
harmless
of
thoughts
in
words
that
were
few
but
of
an
exceeding
coarseness
private
bonmont
was
thinking
deeply
in
front
of
him
beyond
the
barrack
gates
that
closed
in
the
courtyard
of
the
huge
building
stretched
a
circle
of
hills
with
villas
nestling
in
the
purple
branches
of
the
trees
and
sparkling
in
the
morning
sun
there
resided
the
actresses
and
light
women
brought
to
the
town
by
the
presence
of
private
bonmont
a
whole
swarm
of
women
bookmakers
journalists
belonging
to
sporting
and
military
papers
jockeys
procurers
male
and
female
and
swindlers
of
all
descriptions
had
settled
down
in
the
vicinity
of
the
barracks
where
the
rich
conscript
was
serving
his
time
as
he
peeled
the
potatoes
he
might
have
congratulated
himself
on
being
able
to
bring
together
so
parisian
a
society
at
so
great
a
distance
from
paris
but
he
knew
life
well
and
men
better
so
his
pride
was
in
no
way
flattered
by
the
achievement
he
was
worried
and
morose
life
held
only
one
ambition
for
him
and
that
was
the
badge
of
the
brécé
hunt
he
longed
for
it
with
inherited
tenacity
with
the
forcefulness
that
his
father
the
great
baron
had
shown
in
his
conquest
of
souls
bodies
and
things
but
not
with
the
deep
thought
or
genius
of
his
stupendous
parent
he
felt
himself
inferior
to
his
wealth
this
made
him
unhappy
and
in
consequence
spiteful
they
only
give
their
blessed
badge
to
dukes
and
peers
i
know
he
reflected
the
brécés
are
overrun
with
americans
and
jewesses
and
i
m
as
good
as
they
any
day
he
threw
his
peeled
potato
angrily
into
the
cauldron
at
which
private
cocot
with
a
big
laugh
and
a
big
oath
cried
out
there
he
goes
upsetting
the
broth
damn
him
and
briqueballe
who
was
a
simple
soul
and
of
the
same
year
made
merry
at
the
jest
he
rejoiced
too
at
the
thought
that
he
would
soon
see
his
father
who
was
a
at
cayeux
and
his
home
again
that
old
hypocrite
guitrel
will
do
nothing
for
me
thought
private
bonmont
he
is
a
clever
chap
is
guitrel
cleverer
than
i
ever
thought
he
has
made
his
own
conditions
so
long
as
he
is
not
bishop
he
will
not
say
anything
to
his
friends
the
brécés
he
is
a
deep
beggar
and
no
mistake
bonmont
said
briqueballe
stop
chucking
the
peelings
into
the
pot
it
s
a
dirty
trick
said
cocot
i
m
not
on
duty
this
week
objected
bonmont
thus
spoke
these
three
men
because
they
were
on
an
equal
footing
bonmont
went
on
thinking
i
can
do
without
guitrel
there
are
plenty
of
others
who
will
get
the
badge
for
me
terremondre
for
instance
he
knows
the
brécés
well
his
family
is
quite
good
and
he
s
all
right
but
not
to
be
relied
upon
he
s
a
dodger
a
regular
dodger
he
ll
promise
everything
and
do
i
couldn
t
very
well
ask
old
traviès
who
goes
out
helping
rivoire
the
poacher
there
is
general
cartier
de
chalmot
he
d
only
have
to
open
his
mouth
but
the
old
crock
hates
these
were
private
bonmont
s
opinions
and
they
were
not
altogether
unfounded
general
cartier
de
chalmot
did
not
like
him
if
little
bonmont
were
under
me
i
d
make
him
sit
up
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
as
for
the
general
s
wife
her
indignation
regarding
him
knew
no
bounds
since
the
day
she
had
heard
him
say
at
a
ball
putting
all
sentiment
aside
mother
is
too
damned
no
young
bonmont
was
not
mistaken
it
was
no

a

peeled
his

a
sudden
inspiration
came
to
him
supposing
i
made
guitrel
a

that
would
be
rich
as
this
idea
flashed
through
his
brain
a

of

yelled
briqueballe
and
cocot
as
a
shower
of
soot
fell
suddenly
upon
them
around
them
and
into
the
cauldron
soiling
their
wet
fingers
and
blackening
the
potatoes
which
a
moment
before
had
been
ivory
white
looking
up
to
seek
the
cause
of
their
trouble
they
espied
through
the
black
shower
some
of
their
comrades
upon
the
roof
removing
a
long
chimney
flue
and
shaking
out
the
soot
with
which
it
was
filled
as
they
caught
sight
of
them
cocot
and
briqueballe
cried
as
with
one
voice
hi
you
up
there
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
and
they
hurled
at
their
comrades
all
the
curses
their
simple
souls
could
conjure
up
they
were
innocent
curses
full
of
genuine
anger
and
they
filled
the
barrack
yard
with
echoes
in
the
accents
of
picardy
and
burgundy
then
the
face
of
sergeant

with
its
slight
moustache
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
and
amid
the
sudden
silence
a
sarcastic
voice
rasped
out
these
words
three
days
for
you
two
down
there
do
you
understand
briqueballe
and
cocot
stood
overwhelmed
by
the
hard
blows
of
fate
and
discipline
while
their
companion
private
bonmont
reflected
i
can
make
a
bishop
right
enough
i
ve
only
got
to
speak
to
huguet
and
it
s
done
huguet
was
then
president
of
the
council
his
cabinet
was
a
moderate
one
supported
by
the
conservatives
when
forming
it
huguet
had
been
careful
to
safeguard
capital
gaining
thereby
a
calm
and
not
a
little
pride
he
was
minister
of
finance
and
was
supposed
to
have
given
stability
to
the
public
credit
which
had
been
shaken
by
his
radical
predecessor
he
had
not
always
been
so
clever
a
statesman
he
had
been
a
radical
in
his
youth
a
radical
and
a
revolutionary
even
he
had
been
private
secretary
to
the
late
baron
de
bonmont
for
whom
he
wrote
books
and
edited
papers
in
those
days
he
was
a
democrat
and
a
dreamer
in
matters
of
finance
that
was
the
baron
s
wish
for
the
great
man
was
anxious
to
conciliate
the
progressive
factions
of
parliament
and
therefore
liked
to
appear
generous
and
even
something
of
a
dreamer
too
this
was
what
he
called
giving
himself
it
was
he
who
made
his
secretary
member
for
montil
huguet
owed
everything
to
him
and
young
bonmont
realized
all
this
i
shall
only
have
to
say
the
word
to
huguet
he
thought
that
was
how
he
put
it
to
himself
at
any
rate
but
he
was
not
really
sure
of
it
for
he
knew
that
huguet
president
of
the
council
was
careful
to
avoid
any
encounter
with
private
bonmont
and
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
the
old
ties
that
had
associated
him
with
the
great
baron
who
had
died
so
opportunely
amid
dawning
rumours
of
scandal
so
on
second
thoughts
private
bonmont
sagely
decided
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
some
one
else
he
sat
down
upon
the
ground
beside
the
pump
that
he
might
be
able
to
think
more
at
his
ease
and
was
soon
lost
in
meditation
in
his
imagination
every
person
who
might
he
thought
prove
capable
of
disposing
of
the
episcopal
crozier
and
mitre
filed
in
a
long
procession
before
him

from
his
reverie
by
private

pumping

chapter

that
same
evening
leterrier
came
to
see
bergeret
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
riquet
leapt
down
from
the
couch
he
was
sharing
with
his
master
and
with
one
eye
on
the
door
set
up
a
terrific
barking
when
leterrier
came
into
the
room
the
dog
received
him
with
hostile
growls
the
portly
form
and
full
grave
countenance
fringed
with
grey
beard
were
not
familiar
to
him
you
too
murmured
the
rector
gently
please
excuse
him
said
bergeret
he
is
a
domesticated
animal
when
men
undertook
the
training
of
his
forefathers
and
in
so
doing
formed
the
characteristics
he
has
inherited
they
themselves
regarded
a
stranger
as
an
enemy
they
did
not
inculcate
in
dogs
charity
towards
the
human
race
thoughts
of
universal
brotherhood
have
not
entered
the
soul
of
riquet
he
stands
for
the
old
order
of
and
a
very
ancient
one
replied
the
rector
for
it
is
of
course
clear
that
nowadays
we
live
in
unity
peace
and
concord
with
one
another
he
spoke
these
words
with
a
bitterness
not
natural
to
him
but
for
some
time
past
his
thoughts
and
speech
had
changed
however
riquet
continued
to
bark
and
growl
he
was
evidently
doing
his
best
to
scare
away
the
stranger
by
his
voice
and
fearsome
appearance
but
as
fast
as
the
enemy
advanced
he
retreated
he
was
a
faithful
but
cautious
withal
at
last
his
master
growing
impatient
picked
him
up
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
gave
him
two
or
three
taps
on
his
nose
whereupon
riquet
immediately
stopped
barking
wriggled
and
put
out
a
pink
curling
tongue
to
lick
the
hand
that
had
chastised
him
his
beautiful
eyes
full
of
gentle
sadness
the
while
poor
riquet
sighed
leterrier
that
is
all
you
get
for
your
i
must
drive
things
into
his
head
replied
bergeret
pushing
him
behind
him
at
the
back
of
his
chair
now
he
knows
he
was
wrong
to
greet
you
in
such
fashion
riquet
conceives
of
one
evil
only
physical
suffering
and
of
but
one
happiness
the
absence
of
suffering
he
identifies
crime
and
punishment
inasmuch
as
for
him
a
misdeed
is
a
deed
that
is
punished
if
by
accident
i
step
on
his
paw
he
feels
himself
to
be
the
guilty
party
and
begs
my
pardon
justice
and
injustice
do
not
trouble
his
infallible
such
philosophy
spares
him
the
mental
anguish
some
of
us
are
experiencing
said
leterrier
since
the
day
he
had
signed
the
protest
of
the
intellectuals
leterrier
lived
in
a
state
of
perpetual
astonishment
he
had
set
forth
his
reasons
in
a
letter
to
the
local
newspapers
and
could
not
understand
his
opponents
who
called
him
a
jew
a
prussian
an
intellectual
and
said
that
he
had
been
bought
what
also
surprised
him
was
that
eusèbe
boulet
the
editor
of
the
referred
to
him
daily
as
a
disloyal
citizen
and
an
opponent
of
the
army
would
you
believe
it
he
cried
they
have
dared
to
put
in
the
that
i
insult
the
army
insult
the
army
i
who
have
a
son
serving
with
the
colours
the
two
professors
spoke
at
length
of
the
affair
and
leterrier
of
the
still
guileless
soul
repeated
i
can
not
understand
why
political
considerations
and
party
passions
should
be
brought
into
the
affair
at
all
it
is
a
question
of
moral
right
and
far
above
such
things
exactly
replied
bergeret
but
you
would
not
be
in
a
state
of
perpetual
astonishment
if
you
would
only
remember
that
the
passions
of
the
mob
are
simple
and
violent
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
reason
with
such
people
few
men
are
clever
enough
to
keep
control
of
their
minds
during
difficult
investigations
and
it
has
required
sustained
attention
on
our
part
to
discover
the
truth
of
the
matter
it
has
required
sustained
attention
and
the
force
of
minds
trained
to
the
examination
of
facts
with
method
and
sagacity
advantages
such
as
these
and
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
oneself
in
possession
of
them
are
well
worth
a
few
contemptible
when
will
it
all
end
asked
leterrier
in
six
months
perhaps
or
twenty
years
or
never
replied
bergeret
where
will
they
draw
the
line
asked
leterrier
velandum
est
it
is
killing
me
my
friend
it
is
killing
me
it
was
true
his
sense
of
right
and
wrong
had
gone
awry
he
was
feverish
and
his
liver
was
out
of
order
for
the
hundredth
time
he
expounded
the
proofs
which
he
had
amassed
with
all
the
prudence
of
his
mind
and
all
the
zeal
of
his
heart
he
exposed
the
first
causes
of
the
error
which
slowly
but
surely
appeared
behind
the
masses
of
untruth
which
had
veiled
it
then
strong
in
the
conviction
of
right
he
vigorously
demanded
what
answer
can
they
give
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
the
two
professors
heard
a
great
clamour
rising
from
the
street
riquet
lifted
up
his
head
and
listened
anxiously
what
is
it
now
asked
leterrier
it
is
nothing
replied
bergeret
only
pecus
it
was
indeed
as
he
had
said
a
crowd
of
people
uttering
loud
cries
i
think
i
hear
leterrier
said
the
rector
they
must
have
heard
that
i
am
here
i
think
so
too
said
bergeret
and
i
believe
that
they
ll
soon
be
shouting
bergeret
pecus
is
fed
on
ancient
ideas
and
his
aptitude
for
error
is
considerable
feeling
himself
incapable
of
bringing
reason
to
bear
upon
hereditary
prejudices
he
prudently
sticks
to
the
heritage
of
nursery
tales
handed
down
by
his
forefathers
this
particular
kind
of
wisdom
preserves
him
from
errors
that
would
otherwise
do
him
harm
he
keeps
to
the
old
and
tried
errors
he
is
imitative
and
would
be
more
so
were
it
not
that
he
involuntarily
deforms
everything
he
imitates
such
deformations
going
by
the
name
of
progress
pecus
never
thinks
and
it
is
unjust
to
say
that
he
deceives
himself
to
his
unhappiness
be
it
said
everything
combines
to
deceive
him
he
knows
not
the
meaning
of
doubt
for
doubt
springs
from
thought
yet
his
ideas
are
ever
changing
and
at
times
his
stupidity
turns
to
violence
he
excels
in
nothing
for
everything
that
is
in
any
way
excellent
flies
before
him
and
ceases
to
be
his
he
wanders
and
languishes
and
suffers
we
must
give
him
deep
sorrowful
sympathy
we
must
even
venerate
him
for
it
is
from
him
that
all
virtue
all
beauty
and
all
human
glory
spring
poor
pecus
as
bergeret
was
pronouncing
these
words
a
stone
came
hurtling
through

window
and
fell
upon

floor

argument
said
the
rector
picking
up
the
stone
and

in

the

couched

drowned
at

point
by
cries

which
rose
from
the
square
taking
the
stone
from
the
hands
of
the
rector

placed
it
upon
his
table
to
serve
as
a
and
as
soon
as
he
could
hear
himself
speak
went
on
with
his
remarks

cruelties

committed
after

defeat

not

chapter
xiii
being
in
paris
on
sick
leave
young
bonmont
went
to
see
the
automobile
exhibition
that
was
being
held
near
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
in
the
jardin
des
tuileries
as
he
walked
down
one
of
the
side
galleries
reserved
for
parts
and
accessories
he
examined
the
pluto
carburettor
the
abeille
motor
and
the
alphonse
lubricator
with
an
unenthusiastic
eye
and
a
weary
curiosity
with
a
curt
nod
or
wave
of
the
hand
he
returned
the
greetings
of
timid
young
men
and
obsequious
old
ones
he
was
neither
proud
nor
triumphant
but
simple
rather
and
armed
only
with
the
undeviating
and
tranquil
air
of
malevolence
that
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
in
his
dealings
with
men
he
went
his
way
a
short
rather
little
figure
strong
and
vigorous
enough
although
already
attacked
by
disease
he
went
down
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
while
examining
the
distinguishing
the
different
lubricating
oils
he
came
upon
one
of
the
statues
of
the
gardens
which
had
been
shut
in
the
tent
enclosure
it
was
a
classical
study
in
the
french
style
a
bronze
hero
whose
academic
nudity
displayed
the
sculptor
s
skill
and
who
in
a
fine
gymnastic
attitude
was
felling
a
monster
to
the
ground
misled
no
doubt
by
the
apparently
sporting
air
of
the
group
and
never
reflecting
that
the
statue
had
probably
been
in
the
garden
long
before
the
exhibition
bonmont
instinctively
began
to
wonder
what
connexion
it
could
have
with
motoring
he
thought
that
the
monster
a
serpent
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
look
like
a
tube
was
intended
to
represent
a
pneumatic
tyre
but
his
thoughts
were
very
hazy
and
confused
he
turned
aside
his
gaze
almost
immediately
and
entered
the
great
hall
where
the
cars
on
platforms
complacently
displayed
the
clumsy
imperfectly
developed
and
still
forms
which
at
the
same
time
struck
the
onlooker
with
an
irritating
impression
of
and
conceit
young
bonmont
was
not
enjoying
himself
there
he
never
enjoyed
himself
anywhere
but
he
might
have
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
inhaling
the
odour
of
rubber
and
oils
that
filled
the
air
he
might
have
examined
the
autocars
and
autolettes
with
a
little
interest
but
that
for
the
moment
he
was
possessed
by
one
single
idea
he
was
thinking
of
the
brécé
hunt
and
the
longing
to
obtain
the
badge
filled
his
very
soul
from
his
father
he
had
inherited
this
tenacious
will
and
the
burning
intensity
with
which
he
coveted
the
brécé
badge
was
mingled
in
his
veins
with
the
fever
of
incipient
phthisis
he
longed
for
it
with
all
the
impatience
of
a
child
for
his
mind
was
still
very
childish
and
he
longed
for
it
with
the
cunning
tenacity
of
a
calculating
and
ambitious
man
for
he
knew
human
nature
well
having
in
a
few
years
learned
many
things
he
knew
that
as
far
as
the
duc
de
brécé
was
concerned
he
with
his
french
name
and
his
roman
title
was
still
gutenberg
the
jew
he
also
realized
the
power
of
his
millions
and
he
knew
more
upon
this
subject
than
will
ever
be
grasped
by
peoples
or
their
rulers
so
he
was
neither
deluded
nor
discouraged
he
took
in
the
situation
accurately
for
he
was
true
the
campaign
had
been
conducted
with
the
utmost
vehemence
in
agricultural
districts
like
his
own
which
contained
no
jews
but
a
large
number
of
clergy
recent
events
and
the
newspaper
articles
had
been
a
great
strain
upon
the
feeble
head
of
the
duc
de
brécé
the
leader
of
the
catholic
party
in
his
department
doubtless
the
bonmonts
were
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
as
the
grandsons
of
and
were
as
full
of
royalist
devotion
and
quite
as
zealous
catholics
as
himself
but
the
duke
could
not
forget
their
origin
he
was
a
simple
obstinate
man
and
young
bonmont
was
well
aware
of
this
he
reviewed
the
situation
once
again
in
front
of
the
motor
omnibus
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
way
of
obtaining
the
de
brécé
badge
was
to
procure
the
bishop
s
crozier
for
l
abbé
guitrel
i
must
have
him
nominated
he
reflected
it
is
absolutely
necessary
it
will
be
easy
enough
once
i
know
how
to
set
about
and
full
of
regret
he
added
father
would
have
advised
me
in
the
matter
if
he
had
lived
he
must
have
made
more
than
one
bishop
in
gambetta
s
although
he
was
not
quick
at
generalisation
he
went
on
to
remind
himself
that
anything
could
be
bought
for
money
a
thought
which
imbued
him
with
great
confidence
in
the
success
of
his
enterprise
reflecting
thus
he
looked
up
and
saw
young
gustave
dellion
a
little
in
front
of
him
looking
at
a
car
dellion
caught
sight
of
bonmont
at
the
same
moment
but
pretending
he
had
not
seen
him
he
beat
a
retreat
behind
the
body
of
the
vehicle
he
was
under
financial
obligations
to
bonmont
and
for
the
present
was
in
no
way
prepared
to
discharge
them
the
mere
sight
of
his
friend
s
blue
eye
gave
him
a
hollow
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
for
it
was
bonmont
s
habit
to
stare
silently
and
terribly
at
those
of
his
friends
who
owed
him
money
dellion
knew
all
about
that
and
was
much
surprised
when
the
little
bull
as
he
termed
him
joined
him
in
his
retreat
between
the
canvas
wall
of
the
tent
and
the
car
holding
out
a
friendly
hand
and
saying
with
a
pleasant
smile
how
are
you
nice
car
a
bit
long
in
the
body
but
not
so
bad
is
it
that
s
what
you
want
for
valcombe
my
dear
gustave
yes
indeed
there
s
a
pretty
that
would
rip
along
nicely
between
valcombe
and
the
mechanic
who
was
standing
by
the
motor
thought
good
to
intervene
and
to
point
out
to
le
baron
that
the
vehicle
could
be
turned
into
an
open
or
a
closed
phaeton
with
seats
for
four
seeing
that
he
was
dealing
with
connoisseurs
he
launched
out
into
technical
explanations
the
motor
is
composed
of
two
horizontal
cylinders
each
piston
works
a
crank
inclined
at
to
its
in
businesslike
terms
he
demonstrated
the
advantages
of
such
a
combination
then
in
answer
to
a
question
by
gustave
dellion
he
said
that
the
carburettor
was
automatic
and
to
be
regulated
once
for
all
at
the
moment
of
starting
he
stopped
speaking
and
the
two
young
fellows
stood
there
silent
and
attentive
at
last
pushing
his
stick
between
the
spokes
of
one
of
the
wheels
gustave
dellion
remarked
do
you
see
bonmont
steering
is
done
by
differential
gear
it
is
very
easy
to
handle
said
the
mechanic
gustave
dellion
loved
an
automobile
and
not
like
bonmont
with
an
already
satiated
love
he
gazed
at
the
vehicle
which
in
spite
of
the
stiffness
of
modern
looked
like
a
great
animal
a
conventional
banal
though
monster
with
an
apology
for
a
head
between
the
lamps
that
looked
like
two
huge
eyes
not
such
a
bad
whispered
young
bonmont
to
his
friend
why
don
t
you
buy
it
buy
it
can
you
do
anything
you
like
when
you
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
possess
a
father
sighed
gustave
dellion
you
don
t
know
what
a
nuisance
a
family
is
what
a
then
with
feigned
assurance
he
added
and
that
my
dear
bonmont
reminds
me
that
i
owe
you
a
small
a
friendly
hand
fell
upon
his
shoulder
cutting
him
short
and
to
his
surprise
there
stood
at
his
side
a
little
fair
man
his
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
giving
him
the
appearance
of
a
slight
hump
and
a
little
fair
man
who
regarded
him
with
extraordinarily
kind
blue
eyes
and
a
sweet
smile
you
old
fool
said
this
little
man
suggesting
a
little
buffalo
shedding
his
wool
on
the
bushes
out
of
pure
kindness
of
heart
gustave
no
longer
recognized
the
bonmont
he
had
known
and
was
both
touched
and
surprised
jumping
into
the
car
the
little
baron
began
to
handle
the
under
the
benevolent
eye
of
the
mechanic
so
you
drive
bonmont
ventured
gustave
with
deference
occasionally
returned
young
bonmont
then
with
one
hand
upon
the
he
related
a
he
had
made
in
touraine
during
one
of
his
absences
on
sick
leave
from
which
he
always
returned
worse
than
he
went
away
he
had
done
thirty
miles
an
hour
of
course
the
roads
were
dry
and
in
good
condition
but
there
were
cattle
children
and
frightened
horses
to
pass
all
of
which
might
have
caused
trouble
you
had
to
keep
your
eyes
about
you
and
never
let
the
other
fellow
touch
the
wheel
he
related
a
few
incidents
of
the
tour
one
adventure
with
a
milkwoman
standing
out
particularly
in
his
mind
i
saw
the
old
woman
coming
along
he
said
taking
up
the
whole
of
the
road
with
her
horse
and
cart
i
sounded
my
horn
but
the
old
creature
never
moved
aside
then
i
made
straight
for
her
she
was
new
to
that
trick
she
drew
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
pulling
so
hard
at
her
horse
that
he
fell
in
a
heap
with
the
cart
old
woman
and
all
upon
a
pile
of
stones
so
i
left
them
to
it
and
went
on
concluded
young
bonmont
as
he
jumped
out
of
the
car
and
in
spite
of
the
dust
and
the
noise
motoring
is
a
very
pleasant
way
of
getting
about
you
try
it
my
dear
he
is
a
good
sort
after
all
thought
young
dellion
admiringly
and
his
wonder
grew
when
dragging
him
along
by
the
arm
through
the
great
hall
bonmont
said
to
him
you
are
quite
right
don
t
buy
that
motor
i
ll
lend
you
my
runabout
i
shan
t
want
it
because
i
ve
got
to
go
back
my
leave
is
nearly
up
besides
by
the
way
do
you
know
if
madame
de
gromance
is
in
paris
i
believe
so
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
replied
gustave
it
is
some
time
since
i
saw
this
was
in
one
way
an
honourable
falsehood
for
at
ten
minutes
past
seven
on
the
preceding
evening
he
had
left
madame
de
gromance
in
her
room
at
the
hotel
where
they
had
their
rendezvous
bonmont
did
not
reply
but
coming
to
a
full
stop
before
a
notice
in
two
languages
forbidding
smoking
he
gazed
at
it
silently
and
thoughtfully
gustave
following
his
example
remained
speechless
thinking
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
bring
the
interview
to
an
end
so
he
added
but
i
may
see
her
again
soon
i
see
her
if
you
will
tell
me
the
little
baron
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
and
said
would
you
like
to
do
me
a
favour
gustave
assented
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
soul
and
the
uneasiness
of
a
person
suddenly
embarked
upon
a
difficult
enterprise
it
was
none
the
less
true
that
gustave
could
do
ernest
de
bonmont
a
favour
and
the
latter
proceeded
to
enlighten
him
on
the
subject
if
you
would
like
to
do
me
a
favour
my
dear
gustave
get
madame
de
gromance
to
go
and
see
loyer
and
ask
him
to
make
abbé
guitrel
a
and
he
added
you
would
do
me
a
genuine
to
this
request
gustave
replied
by
a
stupefied
silence
and
a
startled
look
not
that
he
intended
to
refuse
but
because
he
had
not
grasped
the
situation
young
bonmont
had
to
repeat
the
same
words
twice
over
and
to
explain
that
loyer
was
minister
of
public
worship
and
nominated
the
bishops
he
was
very
patient
and
little
by
little
gustave
understood
what
was
required
of
him
he
even
managed
to
repeat
what
he
had
heard
without
making
a
single
mistake
you
want
me
to
tell
madame
de
gromance
to
go
and
ask
loyer
who
is
minister
of
public
worship
to
make
guitrel
a
bishop
bishop
of
tourcoing
is
that
in
france
of
ah
said
gustave
thoughtfully
and
he
fell
into
a
reverie
serious
objections
came
to
him
and
at
the
risk
of
appearing
disobliging
he
would
mention
them
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
request
entailed
a
good
deal
and
he
did
not
want
to
enter
upon
it
lightly
timidly
and
hesitatingly
he
formulated
his
first
objection
which
was
a
natural
one
it
isn
t
a
trick
is
it
he
asked
what
do
you
mean
by
a
trick
said
bonmont
shortly
no
really
protested
gustave
you
aren
t
pulling
my
leg
he
was
still
in
doubt
but
the
contemptuous
look
of
the
little
fair
man
dispersed
all
doubt
with
great
firmness
and
decision
he
declared
as
long
as
i
know
it
is
a
serious
matter
you
can
rely
upon
me
i
can
be
serious
when
he
was
silent
awhile
and
the
difficulties
confronting
him
again
rose
in
his
mind
gently
and
timidly
he
said
do
you
think
that
madame
de
gromance
knows
the
minister
well
enough
to
ask
such
a
a
favour
because
you
know
she
never
mentions
loyer
to
and
that
replied
the
little
baron
is
probably
because
she
has
other
subjects
to
discuss
with
you
i
don
t
mean
that
she
is
keen
on
loyer
but
she
thinks
him
a
good
old
sort
and
no
fool
they
got
to
know
each
other
three
years
ago
on
the
platform
at
the
unveiling
of
the
statue
to
jeanne
d
arc
loyer
would
be
only
too
delighted
to
do
anything
to
please
madame
de
gromance
and
i
can
assure
you
he
isn
t
a
bad
sort
when
he
puts
on
his
best
coat
he
looks
like
a
retired
she
can
go
and
see
him
all
right
he
will
be
quite
nice
to
her
and
he
will
most
certainly
do
her
no
harm
in
that
case
said
gustave
she
is
to
ask
him
to
make
guitrel
a
bishop
of
where
did
you
say
bishop
of
tourcoing
repeated
young
bonmont
i
d
better
write
it
down
for
picking
up
from
a
table
before
him
the
trade
card
of
the
builder
of
the
reine
des
pygmées
he
wrote
upon
it
with
his
little
gold
pencil
make
guitrel
bishop
of
gustave
took
the
card
and
the
idea
which
at
first
had
appeared
to
him
so
strange
and
weird
now
seemed
a
simple
and
natural
one
his
mind
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
and
as
he
put
the
card
in
his
pocket
he
repeated
in
the
glibbest
way
make
guitrel
bishop
of
tourcoing
right
you
are
you
can
rely
on
in
this
manner
the
words
of
madame
dellion
were
fulfilled
who
speaking
of
her
son
one
day
had
said
gustave
does
not
learn
quickly
but
he
remembers
what
he
has
learned
and
that
is
perhaps
you
know
said
ernest
seriously
i
can
answer
for
guitrel
making
a
good
so
much
the
better
replied
gustave
because
and
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
they
had
now
reached
the
exit
however
i
shall
be
in
paris
until
the
end
of
the
week
said
bonmont
let
me
know
how
things
are
going
there
is
no
time
to
lose
for
the
candidates
are
being
chosen
now
we
will
speak
of
the
car
at
another
as
they
reached
the
flight
of
steps
he
took
gustave
s
hand
in
his
and
holding
it
impressed
upon
him
no
one
must
know
the
thing
is
of
the
utmost
moment
my
dear
dellion
that
no
one
shall
know
not
a
soul
must
know
that
madame
de
gromance
is
going
to
loyer
at
your
request
now
that
is
understood
is
it
not
quite
replied
gustave
heartily
shaking
his
friend
s
hand
the
same
evening
at
eight
o
clock
young
bonmont
went
to
visit
his
mother
whom
he
did
not
often
see
but
with
whom
he
was
on
the
friendliest
possible
terms
and
found
her
finishing
her
toilet
in
the
while
her
maid
was
arranging
her
hair
she
looked
away
from
her
reflection
in
the
glass
and
turning
to
her
son
you
don
t
look
well
she
said
ernest
s
health
had
been
worrying
her
for
some
time
rara
provided
her
with
other
more
painful
worries
but
her
son
was
for
all
that
a
source
of
anxiety
how
are
you
mother
oh
i
m
very
you
look
did
you
know
that
your
uncle
wallstein
has
had
a
slight
stroke
i
m
not
surprised
he
shouldn
t
be
so
gay
at
his
time
of
life
it
s
he
is
not
so
very
old
only
is
not
what
you
might
call
youthful
exactly
by
the
way
what
about
the
brécés
the
brécés
what
about
them
did
they
thank
you
for
the
ciborium
they
sent
their
card
with
a
pencilled
word
of
that
s
not
well
what
else
did
you
expect
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
raised
her
hands
above
her
head
to
fix
a
diamond
cluster
in
her
hair
standing
thus
her
bare
arms
looked
like
two
handles
springing
from
a
beautifully
shaped
amphora
her
shoulders
gleamed
under
the
electric
light
which
shone
through
transparent
shades
shaped
like
bunches
of
fruit
and
in
the
golden
whiteness
of
the
skin
delicate
blue
veins
ran
down
to
the
swell
of
her
bosom
her
cheeks
were
rouged
and
her
lips
painted
but
her
face
was
still
youthful
in
its
health
and
vigour
the
lines
of
her
neck
which
might
have
betrayed
the
passage
of
the
years
were
lost
in
the
beauty
of
the
skin
young
bonmont
studied
her
carefully
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
mother
suppose
you
go
and
see
loyer
too
and
ask
him
about
abbé
guitrel
chapter
xiv
madame
de
bonmont
who
had
chosen
raoul
marcien
from
among
all
others
and
who
loved
him
with
deep
affection
was
justified
for
the
space
of
a
few
weeks
in
congratulating
herself
upon
her
choice
and
in
believing
herself
a
happy
woman
a
tremendous
change
had
taken
place
in
the
order
of
things
raoul
who
had
formerly
been
despised
or
disliked
in
all
circles
of
society
who
had
been
rejected
by
his
regiment
cut
by
his
friends
cast
off
by
his
relations
expelled
from
his
club
who
was
known
in
all
the
courts
of
law
by
reason
of
the
repeated
charges
of
swindling
brought
against
him
had
suddenly
become
cleansed
of
all
stain
and
purified
of
all
dishonour
certain
events
guessed
at
no
doubt
and
soon
to
be
made
clear
had
interested
the
government
on
his
behalf
it
was
exceedingly
necessary
that
raoul
should
pass
for
an
honourable
man
in
public
and
in
private
ministers
maintained
that
the
power
and
glory
of
france
and
the
peace
of
the
whole
world
depended
upon
this
his
honour
was
of
public
utility
and
each
and
all
did
their
best
to
make
it
an
established
fact
the
government
worked
to
this
end
as
did
the
lawyers
and
the
newspapers
in
fact
all
good
citizens
worked
joyfully
for
its
establishment
madame
de
bonmont
experienced
both
pleasure
and
uneasiness
at
the
sudden
transformation
of
her
lover
into
an
example
and
a
model
for
all
frenchmen
she
was
made
for
the
enjoyment
of
tranquil
joys
and
pleasures
and
all
this
fame
astonished
and
made
her
ill
at
ease
when
with
raoul
she
had
the
fatiguing
sensation
of
living
perpetually
in
a
lift
evidences
of
the
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
amazed
the
simple
elizabeth
both
by
their
number
and
extent
congratulations
flattering
pledges
certificates
compliments
and
praises
poured
in
from
all
the
bodies
known
and
unknown
and
from
all
the
public
societies
in
town
and
country
they
came
from
the
courts
the
barracks
the
archbishops
palaces
from
the
town
halls
and
great
houses
of
france
they
rang
out
in
the
street
riots
and
resounded
with
the
bugles
during
torchlight
processions
his
honour
shone
proudly
forth
nowadays
it
flamed
into
being
like
a
huge
cross
at
an
illuminated
fête
whether
he
went
to
the
palais
de
justice
or
to
the
he
was
greeted
by
the
acclamations
of
the
crowd
and
princes
begged
for
the
honour
of
touching
his
hand
and
in
spite
of
all
this
raoul
was
not
at
peace
when
in
the
little
apartment
hung
with
draperies
intended
by
madame
de
bonmont
to
shelter
their
mutual
love
he
was
always
sombre
and
violent
when
he
heard
his
worth
and
praises
shouted
in
the
streets
when
he
could
not
listen
to
the
rumbling
wheels
of
an
omnibus
or
the
shriek
of
a
tram
without
knowing
that
both
vehicles
contained
the
supporters
and
guardians
of
his
honour
he
still
remained
plunged
in
the
bitterest
most
dismal
thoughts
and
cherished
terrible
designs
with
frowning
brows
and
clenched
teeth
he
muttered
curses
he
chewed
threats
as
a
sailor
chews
his
tobacco
scoundrels
wretches
i
ll
run
them
through
the
body
it
may
seem
almost
impossible
but
is
nevertheless
true
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
people
s
acclamations
he
did
not
hear
them
and
the
only
people
he
thought
of
were
his
few
accusers
all
of
whom
were
believed
to
be
dispersed
destroyed
and
reduced
to
powder
in
his
imagination
he
saw
them
standing
before
him
with
threatening
faces
and
at
sight
of
them
terror
made
his
yellow
eyes
start
from
his
head
his
fury
was
a
source
of
consternation
to
poor
madame
de
bonmont
who
only
heard
hoarse
cries
of
hatred
and
vengeance
coming
from
the
lips
which
should
have
given
her
kisses
and
words
of
love
and
she
was
the
more
surprised
and
uncomfortable
because
her
lover
s
threats
were
directed
as
much
against
friend
as
against
foe
for
when
he
spoke
of
running
them
through
raoul
never
stopped
to
make
the
subtle
distinction
between
his
defenders
and
his
adversaries
his
great
mind
took
in
the
whole
of
his
country
yes
and
the
whole
of
the
human
race
he
would
spend
hours
every
day
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
caged
lion
or
panther
in
the
two
little
rooms
that
madame
de
bonmont
had
hung
with
blue
silk
and
furnished
with
cosy
lounges
in
the
hope
of
better
things
i
ll
do
for
them
he
muttered
as
he
strode
up
and
down
seated
in
one
corner
of
the
big
couch
she
would
follow
his
movements
with
a
timid
look
and
listen
anxiously
to
his
words
not
that
the
sentiments
expressed
by
him
appeared
to
her
in
any
way
unworthy
of
her
beloved
instinctively
submissive
naturally
docile
she
admired
strength
in
all
its
forms
and
flattered
herself
with
the
vague
hope
that
a
man
who
was
capable
of
such
wholesale
slaughter
might
also
at
another
time
be
capable
of
wonderful
embraces
and
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
couch
she
waited
with
eyes
and
gently
heaving
bosom
for
her
raoul
s
mood
to
change
she
waited
in
vain
the
vociferations
continued
to
make
her
start
i
ll
do
for
them
occasionally
she
would
timidly
try
to
appease
his
fury
in
a
voice
as
full
as
her
figure
she
would
murmur
but
they
are
doing
you
full
justice
dearest
every
one
knows
you
to
be
a
man
of
honour
it
may
be
true
that
the
slender
david
succeeded
in
calming
the
fury
of
saul
with
his
shepherd
s
lute
the
sound
of
which
was
thinner
than
a
cricket
s
chirrup
elizabeth
less
fortunate
than
he
vainly
offered
to
raoul
the
nirvana
of
her
sighs
and
the
splendour
of
her
pink
and
white
self
without
daring
to
look
at
him
she
ventured
to
say
i
can
not
understand
you
you
have
confounded
your
detractors
the
general
embraced
you
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
other
day
and
the
ministers
she
got
no
further
he
burst
out
you
mention
those
blackguards
to
me
they
are
only
trying
to
find
some
way
of
getting
at
me
they
would
like
to
see
me
a
hundred
feet
under
the
ground
but
they
had
better
be
careful
i
will
devour
them
piecemeal
then
he
came
back
to
his
dear
familiar
thought
i
must
do
for
them
this
was
his
dream
i
should
like
to
be
in
an
immense
marble
hall
full
of
people
and
to
lay
about
me
with
a
big
stick
to
strike
for
days
and
nights
until
the
floor
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
were
red
with
blood
she
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
only
looked
in
silence
at
her
breast
where
lay
the
little
bunch
of
violets
she
had
bought
for
him
and
dared
not
offer
he
gave
her
no
more
love
it
was
over
and
done
with
the
man
would
have
taken
pity
on
the
pretty
gentle
creature
who
with
her
voluptuous
body
and
skin
of
milk
and
roses
resembled
some
big
warm
flower
in
its
beauty
neglected
abandoned
and
left
without
care
or
culture
she
was
suffering
and
being
piously
inclined
she
sought
a
remedy
in
religion
thinking
that
an
interview
with
abbé
guitrel
would
be
of
great
service
to
raoul
she
resolved
to
bring
the
priest
and
her
lover
together
chapter
xv
before
dressing
philippe
dellion
pulled
aside
the
and
looking
out
into
the
night
watched
the
carriage
lamps
passing
to
and
fro
in
the
busy
street
for
a
moment
or
two
the
sight
pleased
him
he
had
been
in
this
room
separated
from
the
outer
world
for
the
space
of
two
hours
what
are
you
looking
at
asked
madame
de
gromance
sitting
up
in
the
bed
and
arranging
her
tumbled
hair
do
strike
a
light
it
is
impossible
to
see
a
he
lighted
the
candles
that
stood
in
little
copper
stands
on
either
side
of
a
gilded
clock
adorned
with
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
the
gentle
light
reflected
itself
in
the
wardrobe
and
made
the
rosewood
cornice
glisten
little
rays
flickering
everywhere
in
the
room
lit
up
the
scattered
garments
and
died
gently
away
in
the
curtains
folds
the
room
was
an
apartment
in
a
highly
respectable
hotel
in
a
street
near
the
boulevard
des
capucines
madame
de
gromance
in
her
wisdom
had
selected
it
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
less
subtle
arrangements
of
philippe
who
had
hired
a
little
in
the
lonely
avenue
kléber
it
was
her
opinion
that
a
woman
who
wished
to
keep
her
affairs
to
herself
must
see
that
they
take
place
in
the
very
heart
of
paris
in
some
respectable
hotel
frequented
by
people
of
divers
races
and
tongues
she
hardly
ever
spent
more
than
two
consecutive
months
in
paris
but
she
frequently
met
philippe
there
and
in
far
greater
security
than
she
could
have
done
in
the
provinces
as
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
the
soft
light
fell
upon
her
fair
fluffy
hair
the
skin
of
her
sloping
shoulders
and
her
pretty
but
somewhat
drooping
breast
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
late
again
she
said
tell
me
the
time
and
don
t
make
a
mistake
it
s
really
important
why
do
you
always
call
me
ten
past
six
he
returned
in
a
surly
voice
ten
past
six
are
you
quite
sure
i
call
you
because
i
love
you
what
would
you
have
me
call
you
i
call
you
clotilde
you
might
occasionally
call
me
i
never
do
call
people
by
their
oh
well
no
matter
he
said
bitterly
i
don
t
presume
to
imagine
that
i
shall
change
your
she
picked
up
her
stockings
from
the
floor
stretching
her
back
like
a
cat
about
to
pounce
upon
a
mouse
what
does
it
matter
i
never
think
of
calling
you
by
your
christian
name
as
i
do
my
husband
or
my
brother
or
my
all
right
all
right
he
replied
i
will
conform
to
what
custom
jumping
up
with
her
stockings
in
her
hand
she
came
across
the
room
and
kissed
him
upon
the
neck
though
by
no
means
a
clever
man
he
was
suspicious
and
an
idea
that
had
lately
struck
him
was
worrying
him
he
suspected
that
madame
de
gromance
was
careful
to
avoid
making
use
of
his
name
or
of
the
name
of
any
other
lover
for
fear
of
getting
mixed
in
a
moment
of
supreme
excitement
for
she
was
a
sensitive
soul
he
was
not
exactly
jealous
but
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
proper
pride
had
he
known
that
madame
de
gromance
was
unfaithful
to
him
his
vanity
would
have
suffered
on
the
other
hand
the
desire
he
had
for
the
pretty
creature
was
proportionate
only
to
the
desire
he
believed
her
to
inspire
in
others
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
it
was
considered
necessary
to
be
the
lover
of
madame
de
gromance
or
of
any
other
society
woman
many
of
his
intimate
friends
preferred
an
automobile
to
a
mistress
he
liked
her
well
enough
and
had
no
objection
to
being
her
lover
so
long
as
it
was
considered
the
thing
but
if
it
was
not
he
could
not
see
why
he
should
persist
in
the
matter
the
deep
animal
instinct
in
him
and
his
outlook
as
a
man
of
the
world
scarcely
agreed
and
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
conciliate
such
conflicting
elements
the
result
being
that
there
was
an
imperfect
indeterminate
tone
about
his
remarks
that
rather
fascinated
madame
de
gromance
who
would
not
take
the
trouble
of
finding
the
solution
and
making
things
clear
if
it
came
to
the
point
his
charmer
would
say
to
him
of
course
i
ve
never
loved
any
man
but
you
but
that
was
less
in
the
hope
of
convincing
him
than
in
the
desire
to
say
the
thing
most
fitting
the
occasion
and
at
such
moments
when
reflection
is
at
a
disadvantage
the
tremendous
difficulty
presented
by
belief
in
such
a
statement
never
occurred
to
him
later
when
he
began
to
reason
doubt
assailed
him
his
doubt
found
expression
in
cruel
and
sarcastic
remarks
and
he
practised
the
art
of
keeping
his
mind
in
a
state
of
vague
unrest
on
this
particular
occasion
he
was
less
sulky
and
bitter
than
usual
and
hardly
even
jealous
or
mistrustful
he
merely
displayed
the
that
naturally
follows
gratified
desire
madame
de
gromance
on
the
contrary
was
quite
prepared
for
the
blackest
fit
of
spite
and
unkindness
for
on
that
very
day
her
strength
combined
with
her
weakness
her
natural
inspiration
and
deep
artifice
had
obtained
from
him
a
more
liberal
display
of
affection
than
that
which
on
principle
he
usually
vouchsafed
she
had
led
him
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
moderation
a
thing
he
did
not
easily
forgive
for
he
was
solicitous
of
his
health
and
keen
on
keeping
in
condition
for
exercise
and
sport
whenever
madame
de
gromance
led
him
further
than
he
wished
he
afterwards
avenged
himself
by
unkind
words
and
a
still
more
unkind
silence
she
did
not
mind
for
she
loved
love
and
experience
had
taught
her
that
all
men
are
disagreeable
as
soon
as
they
get
what
they
want
so
she
calmly
awaited
the
reproaches
she
knew
she
deserved
she
was
disappointed
in
her
expectations
however
for
a
remark
from
philippe
showed
her
that
his
mind
was
quiet
and
at
rest
my
shirtmaker
is
an
ass
he
said
he
carefully
dressed
himself
before
the
glass
and
turned
great
thoughts
over
and
over
in
his
mind
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
he
asked
in
quite
a
pleasant
tone
you
know
loyer
don
t
you
and
slightly
flushed
with
her
white
figure
thrown
into
relief
by
the
dark
velvet
of
the
she
was
sitting
buttoning
her
boots
as
she
sat
there
with
her
head
and
neck
bent
over
her
crossed
legs
the
light
shone
upon
her
hair
and
upon
the
bare
limbs
revealed
by
the
short
garment
she
wore
making
one
think
of
an
allegorical
figure
from
some
painted
venetian
ceiling
this
resemblance
did
not
however
strike
philippe
he
repeated
his
question
do
you
know
loyer
she
lifted
her
head
dangling
the
buttonhook
from
the
tips
of
her
fingers
loyer
the
cabinet
minister
yes
i
know
do
you
know
him
well
not
very
well
but
i
do
know
the
man
under
discussion
loyer
the
senator
keeper
of
the
seals
and
minister
of
public
worship
was
an
old
bachelor
honest
enough
outside
politics
a
bit
of
a
lawyer
and
a
philosopher
whose
hair
had
turned
grey
in
the
enjoyment
of
clandestine
love
and
tavern
nights
as
he
had
not
made
his
entry
into
society
until
somewhat
late
in
life
the
women
he
met
there
were
a
continual
source
of
wonder
to
him
as
he
devoured
them
with
eyes
he
was
very
young
for
his
sixty
years
and
had
known
how
to
appreciate
madame
de
gromance
at
her
true
value
when
he
had
first
met
her
in
the
of
the
that
was
seven
years
ago
loyer
had
come
to
the
town
of
to
unveil
a
statue
to
joan
of
arc
and
had
then
pronounced
the
memorable
speech
that
terminated
magnificently
with
a
comparison
between
the
maid
and
gambetta
each
of
whom
was
transfigured
said
the
orator
by
the
sublime
light
of
the
conservatives
who
already
were
secretly
siding
with
the
radicals
because
of
their
financial
policy
were
grateful
to
the
minister
for
binding
them
anew
to
the
old
regime
with
the
honourable
bonds
of
a
generous
sentiment
de
gromance
had
offered
him
his
hand
saying
as
an
old
royalist
monsieur
le
ministre
i
thank
you
for
jeanne
and
for
france
when
loyer
walked
that
evening
with
madame
de
gromance
in
the
gardens
of
the
lighted
up
by
hundreds
of
chinese
lanterns
fixed
to
the
trees
trees
that
had
been
planted
in
by
the
benedictines
of
sillé
so
that
two
centuries
later
madame
might
enjoy
their
shade
the
minister
who
had
been
told
by
the
préfet
himself
that
the
old
royalist
was
the
most
deluded
husband
in
the
department
whispered
a
few
gallantries
into
the
young
woman
s
pink
ear
he
was
a
burgundian
and
prided
himself
on
being
a
daring
one
at
that
impressed
by
the
beauty
of
the
historic
evening
he
remarked
as
he
took
leave
of
madame
de
gromance
that
the
illuminations
made
him
inclined
to
dream
madame
de
gromance
liked
loyer
and
subsequently
begged
of
him
several
little
favours
on
behalf
of
her
parish
and
district
which
the
old
fellow
granted
demanding
nothing
in
return
quite
content
with
being
allowed
to
pat
the
arms
and
shoulders
of
the
beautiful
and
to
ask
in
a
jocular
manner
after
her
old
she
could
therefore
quite
well
allow
that
she
knew
loyer
who
was
in
the
radical
cabinet
as
minister
of
public
worship
i
know
loyer
as
one
knows
a
person
who
does
not
belong
to
the
same
set
as
oneself
why
do
you
ask
because
if
you
know
him
well
enough
i
want
you
to
ask
him
to
do
something
for
what
do
you
want
to
bear
off
the
academic
honours
like
bergeret
no
said
philippe
seriously
it
is
something
more
important
i
want
you
to
speak
to
him
about
abbé
in
her
surprise
she
stood
up
revealing
a
glimpse
of
dazzling
flesh
above
her
stockings
astonishment
gave
her
the
semblance
of
innocence
why
she
demanded
he
was
carefully
knotting
his
tie
i
want
loyer
to
make
him
bishop
the
word
produced
abundant
and
definite
ideas
in
the
mind
of
madame
de
gromance
for
years
and
years
she
had
seen
the
short
fat
figure
and
covered
with
the
cope
rubicund
shapeless
dignified
of
monseigneur
charlot
officiating
on
at
the
cathedral
she
had
often
dined
with
him
and
had
received
him
at
her
own
table
in
common
with
all
the
other
ladies
of
the
diocese
she
admired
the
clever
repartee
and
handsome
calves
of
the
she
also
knew
a
considerable
number
of
bishops
all
of
whom
were
worthy
men
but
she
had
never
reflected
on
the
influences
that
confer
episcopal
dignity
upon
a
priest
it
seemed
to
her
strange
that
a
but
common
and
man
like
loyer
should
have
the
power
to
create
a
prelate
like
monseigneur
charlot
she
sat
there
thoughtful
looking
around
the
room
from
the
tumbled
bed
to
the
little
table
upon
which
were
placed
a
bottle
of
sherry
and
some
biscuits
from
the
chair
on
which
she
had
thrown
some
of
her
garments
to
the
untidy
her
beautiful
unintelligent
eyes
wandered
seeing
nothing
but
lace
rochets
crosiers
crosses
and
amethyst
rings
feeling
absolutely
at
a
loss
she
inquired
do
you
think
bishops
are
made
like
that
of
course
he
replied
with
assurance
and
so
you
think
that
if
i
were
to
ask
loyer
to
make
abbé
guitrel
a
bishop
he
assured
her
that
loyer
who
was
an
old
gallant
would
not
refuse
that
to
a
pretty
woman
she
fixed
her
pink
silk
knickers
to
a
hook
on
her
silk
stays
then
as
he
pressed
for
a
reply
and
insisted
upon
her
going
immediately
to
see
the
minister
she
grew
exceedingly
curious
and
not
a
little
suspicious
but
why
do
you
want
abbé
guitrel
to
be
made
a
bishop
why
to
please
mother
and
because
i
like
the
fellow
he
is
intelligent
and
up
to
date
there
aren
t
so
many
like
him
yes
he
really
is
advanced
and
in
the
pope
s
good
books
besides
and
mother
would
be
so
then
why
doesn
t
she
go
herself
and
settle
the
business
with
loyer
in
the
first
place
darling
it
wouldn
t
be
at
all
the
same
besides
my
parents
are
not
in
very
great
favour
with
this
cabinet
my
father
as
president
of
the
chambre
syndicale
des
métaux
has
been
protesting
against
the
new
tariffs
you
can
not
imagine
how
irritating
these
economic
questions
can
but
she
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
deceiving
her
and
that
it
was
not
filial
love
that
made
him
dabble
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
she
went
round
the
room
in
her
pink
knickers
of
flowered
silk
lithe
agile
and
pliable
stooping
here
and
there
over
the
scattered
garments
searching
for
her
petticoat
i
want
your
advice
what
about
after
spending
an
unconscionable
time
arranging
his
tie
in
front
of
the
glass
and
lighting
a
cigarette
he
complacently
sat
watching
her
as
she
flitted
about
the
room
in
a
costume
that
exaggerated
so
prettily
all
that
was
feminine
in
her
exceedingly
feminine
body
he
did
not
know
whether
to
think
her
graceful
or
ridiculous
he
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
think
such
things
really
unbeautiful
or
whether
he
should
experience
some
slight
artistic
pleasure
in
beholding
them
his
doubt
arose
from
the
recollection
of
a
long
discussion
which
had
taken
place
the
winter
before
in
the
at
his
father
s
house
between
two
old
gallants
de
terremondre
who
could
think
of
nothing
more
adorable
than
a
pretty
woman
in
her
knickers
and
stays
and
paul
flin
who
on
the
contrary
pitied
a
woman
for
her
ungraceful
appearance
at
this
particular
stage
of
her
toilet
philippe
had
followed
this
entertaining
discussion
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
which
of
the
two
was
right
terremondre
was
a
man
of
experience
but
he
was
and
too
artistic
paul
flin
was
considered
less
clever
but
very
smart
philippe
s
natural
malevolence
and
elective
affinities
were
making
him
incline
to
the
latter
s
theory
when
madame
de
gromance
put
on
her
pink
silk
petticoat
do
advise
me
this
year
fur
dresses
are
all
the
rage
but
what
do
you
say
to
a
red
cloth
dress
a
rich
red
say
ruby
a
fur
coat
and
fur
toque
with
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
he
did
not
speak
and
only
betrayed
his
thought
by
a
nod
of
the
head
at
last
he
opened
his
mouth
whence
issued
instead
of
words
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
deep
in
her
dream
she
continued
with
buttons
of
old
paste
very
narrow
sleeves
and
a
tight
he
spoke
at
last
a
tight
skirt
yes
that
would
be
all
then
she
remembered
that
he
knew
nothing
about
skirts
or
bodices
an
idea
flashed
into
her
mind
and
matured
it
is
funny
she
cried
only
the
men
who
do
not
care
about
women
are
interested
in
women
s
dress
and
the
men
who
like
them
never
notice
what
they
wear
now
you
for
instance
i
am
sure
you
could
not
tell
me
what
dress
i
had
on
last
saturday
at
your
mother
s
while
little
suequet
whose
tastes
as
everybody
knows
are
different
talks
and
quite
prettily
he
is
a
born
dressmaker
and
milliner
that
boy
tell
me
how
do
you
account
for
it
it
would
take
too
you
are
sitting
on
my
skirt
while
i
think
of
it
emmanuel
says
that
you
are
neglecting
him
yesterday
he
expected
you
to
come
and
see
a
horse
that
he
wants
to
buy
and
you
didn
t
turn
up
he
s
awfully
annoyed
at
these
words
philippe
broke
into
a
torrent
of
abuse
your
husband
bores
me
to
tears
he
s
a
grotesque
fool
and
the
most
awful
bore
you
must
admit
yourself
that
pottering
about
all
day
in
his
stables
his
kennels
and
his
kitchen
garden
for
he
goes
in
for
gardening
too
the
duffer
looking
at
the
dogs
food
the
horses
and
isn
t
what
you
might
call
exciting
and
then
when
one
comes
to
think
of
you
and
me
i
must
say
it
is
a
bit
thick
for
your
husband
to
hang
on
to
me
as
he
does
he
s
such
a
fool
that
he
makes
people
talk
it
s
perfectly
true
i
tell
you
people
are
beginning
to
she
answered
him
gently
and
seriously
while
she
slipped
on
her
skirt
don
t
abuse
my
husband
philippe
as
i
am
obliged
to
have
a
husband
of
some
sort
it
is
a
very
good
thing
mine
is
like
he
is
just
think
for
a
moment
we
might
have
somebody
much
worse
to
deal
philippe
s
anger
would
not
be
calmed
and
he
loves
you
the
beast
she
made
a
little
grimace
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
to
imply
that
that
was
not
worth
mentioning
that
is
how
philippe
chose
to
interpret
it
for
he
went
on
to
enlarge
upon
the
subject
as
far
as
that
goes
anyone
can
see
at
a
glance
that
he
s
not
much
of
a
man
with
the
women
but
even
then
some
things
don
t
bear
thinking
madame
de
gromance
turned
to
philippe
a
beautiful
look
full
of
happiness
and
peace
a
look
that
counselled
the
banishment
of
all
painful
thoughts
and
going
up
to
him
placed
full
upon
his
lips
a
kiss
magnificent
as
a
royal
scarlet
seal
mind
my
cigarette
he
said
by
this
time
she
was
clothed
in
a
very
simple
grey
dress
and
was
arranging
her
toque
upon
her
fluffy
hair
suddenly
she
broke
into
a
laugh
and
he
inquired
the
cause
of
her
amusement
oh
nothing
then
as
he
persisted
in
his
inquiry
well
i
was
only
thinking
that
when
your
mother
went
to
see
her
lover
years
ago
you
know
she
must
have
found
her
hair
a
terrible
nuisance
that
is
if
she
wore
it
as
it
is
in
that
portrait
you
have
of
her
at
he
made
no
reply
not
quite
knowing
how
to
treat
a
joke
of
this
description
which
inwardly
shocked
him
you
re
not
angry
surely
she
went
on
you
do
love
me
don
t
you
no
he
was
not
angry
yes
he
loved
her
and
she
returned
to
her
original
idea
it
is
strange
you
know
sons
always
believe
in
the
virtue
of
their
mothers
daughters
too
but
not
so
implicitly
and
yet
the
fact
of
a
woman
having
had
children
is
surely
not
sufficient
to
prove
that
she
has
never
had
she
reflected
a
moment
and
then
went
on
things
are
complicated
in
this
world
goodbye
i
am
walking
and
have
only
just
time
to
get
why
are
you
walking
because
it
is
good
for
my
health
and
then
it
explains
my
not
having
the
carriage
and
it
s
rather
she
scrutinized
herself
in
the
first
then
sideways
finally
glancing
at
her
back
view
at
this
hour
of
the
day
for
instance
i
am
sure
to
collect
a
good
number
of
why
because
i
look
rather
what
i
mean
is
why
at
this
hour
specially
because
it
is
evening
the
streets
are
always
full
just
before
but
who
follows
you
what
sort
of
people
all
sorts
men
about
town
workmen
and
priests
yesterday
a
nigger
followed
me
he
had
on
a
hat
that
shone
like
a
mirror
he
was
awfully
did
he
speak
to
you
oh
yes
he
said
madame
will
you
go
for
a
drive
with
me
or
are
you
afraid
of
losing
your
reputation
what
a
silly
remark
some
of
them
say
much
sillier
things
she
answered
gravely
adieu
we
ve
had
a
lovely
time
her
hand
was
already
on
the
key
of
the
door
when
he
stopped
her
clotilde
said
he
promise
me
you
will
go
and
see
loyer
and
that
you
will
say
to
him
very
nicely
m
loyer
you
have
a
vacant
see
to
dispose
of
make
abbé
guitrel
bishop
you
can
not
do
better
the
pope
thinks
very
highly
of
she
shook
her
pretty
head
go
and
see
loyer
for
that
can
you
imagine
me
in
the
cage
of
that
old
gorilla
we
must
make
some
special
arrangement
meet
him
at
some
friend
s
house
or
something
of
the
but
objected
philippe
it
s
very
important
at
any
moment
loyer
may
sign
the
appointments
now
there
are
several
vacant
she
reflected
a
moment
and
making
a
special
effort
to
think
clearly
said
you
must
be
mistaken
said
she
it
s
loyer
who
appoints
the
bishops
it
s
the
pope
really
it
is
or
the
nuncio
i
can
prove
that
for
the
other
day
emmanuel
said
the
nuncio
ought
to
overcome
the
modesty
of
de
goulet
and
offer
him
a
so
you
he
tried
to
convince
her
to
the
contrary
taking
the
trouble
to
explain
the
reason
why
listen
to
me
the
minister
chooses
the
bishops
and
the
nuncio
confirms
the
minister
s
choice
that
is
what
is
called
the
concordat
you
must
say
to
loyer
i
know
of
an
intelligent
priest
one
that
the
pope
thinks
of
very
highly
yes
yes
i
know
she
opened
wide
eyes
of
wonder
it
s
an
extraordinary
thing
you
are
asking
of
me
her
amazement
came
from
the
fact
that
she
was
religious
and
had
the
greatest
veneration
for
holy
things
he
was
a
little
less
religious
than
she
but
perhaps
a
trifle
more
scrupulous
and
in
his
innermost
self
he
recognized
that
she
was
right
and
that
it
was
an
extraordinary
thing
to
ask
of
her
but
he
was
so
anxious
for
the
matter
to
be
concluded
that
he
hastened
to
reassure
her
i
am
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
forbidden
by
religion
he
protested
in
the
meanwhile
her
first
curiosity
had
returned
but
why
do
you
want
guitrel
to
be
chosen
she
asked
he
answered
confusedly
as
he
had
done
before
mother
would
be
pleased
and
other
people
what
other
people
oh
heaps
of
them
the
the
bonmonts
but
they
are
jews
that
doesn
t
matter
there
are
jews
even
among
the
madame
de
gromance
grew
more
suspicious
as
soon
as
she
learned
that
the
bonmonts
were
mixed
up
in
the
singular
affair
but
being
affectionate
and
easily
led
she
promised
philippe
she
would
do
as
he
asked
chapter
xvi
l
abbé
candidate
for
the
episcopacy
was
ushered
into
the
study
of
the
nuncio
monseigneur
cima
whose
appearance
at
first
sight
came
as
a
surprise
for
his
pale
countenance
on
which
the
years
had
left
traces
of
fatigue
showed
no
signs
of
age
at
forty
he
looked
rather
like
a
sickly
youth
and
when
he
cast
down
his
eyes
his
face
was
as
the
face
of
a
dead
man
he
signed
to
the
visitor
to
be
seated
and
assuming
his
usual
attitude
leaned
back
in
his
easy
chair
and
prepared
to
listen
to
him
with
his
right
elbow
in
his
left
hand
and
his
head
resting
in
the
hollow
of
his
right
hand
he
had
a
grace
that
struck
one
as
vaguely
funereal
and
called
to
mind
certain
figures
on
ancient
when
in
repose
his
face
was
veiled
in
melancholy
but
as
soon
as
he
smiled
it
radiated
humour
the
gaze
of
his
beautiful
dark
eyes
gave
one
a
feeling
of
discomfort
at
naples
he
was
said
to
possess
the
evil
eye
in
france
he
passed
for
a
clever
politician
l
abbé
guitrel
thought
it
advisable
to
make
only
a
passing
allusion
to
the
object
of
his
visit
mother
church
in
her
wisdom
might
dispose
of
him
as
she
judged
good
all
his
feelings
of
love
for
her
were
blended
in
an
entire
obedience
to
her
will
monseigneur
he
added
i
am
a
priest
in
other
words
a
soldier
and
i
aspire
to
the
glory
of
obedience
slowly
bending
his
head
as
a
sign
of
approbation
monseigneur
cima
asked
the
abbé
if
he
had
been
in
any
way
acquainted
with
duclou
the
late
bishop
of
tourcoing
i
knew
him
when
he
was
curé
at
orleans
orleans
a
pleasant
town
i
have
relations
there
distant
cousins
of
mine
duclou
was
very
old
when
he
died
do
you
know
what
caused
his
death
stone
the
cause
of
the
death
of
many
old
men
although
science
has
discovered
many
things
to
mitigate
this
terrible
yes
indeed
monseigneur
i
used
to
know
duclou
at
rome
he
often
had
a
rubber
of
whist
with
me
have
you
ever
been
to
rome
guitrel
monseigneur
that
is
a
joy
so
far
denied
me
but
i
have
long
sojourned
there
in
thought
my
spirit
has
outstripped
my
body
in
its
journey
to
the
yes
yes
the
pope
would
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
he
likes
france
very
much
the
best
time
for
a
visit
to
rome
is
during
the
spring
for
in
summer
malaria
is
rife
in
the
countryside
and
in
some
parts
of
the
city
i
do
not
fear
of
course
not
besides
provided
one
takes
certain
precautions
one
can
always
ward
off
fevers
you
must
never
go
out
at
night
without
your
cloak
and
foreigners
especially
should
never
go
out
in
open
vehicles
after
the
sun
has
i
have
heard
monseigneur
that
the
coliseum
by
moonlight
is
a
truly
wonderful
the
air
is
treacherous
in
that
district
and
the
gardens
of
the
villa
borghese
are
also
to
be
avoided
for
the
same
really
monseigneur
yes
yes
i
who
am
can
not
endure
the
climate
of
rome
i
prefer
to
go
to
brussels
i
was
there
for
a
year
some
time
ago
and
can
think
of
no
town
that
i
like
better
i
have
relations
there
tourcoing
is
that
a
large
town
about
inhabitants
i
believe
monseigneur
it
is
a
manufacturing
i
know
i
know
duclou
used
to
tell
me
in
rome
that
he
could
only
find
one
fault
with
his
flock
they
drank
beer
he
used
to
say
that
if
they
would
only
drink
the
light
wines
of
orleans
they
would
be
the
most
perfect
christians
in
the
world
but
hops
made
them
m
duclou
was
a
very
witty
he
disliked
beer
and
once
i
surprised
him
very
much
by
telling
him
that
it
was
quite
popular
in
italy
nowadays
there
are
very
prosperous
german
in
florence
rome
naples
and
most
of
the
other
towns
do
you
like
beer
guitrel
i
do
not
dislike
it
the
nuncio
gave
his
ring
to
the
priest
who
kissed
it
and
took
a
respectful
leave
the
nuncio
rang
the
bell
show
lantaigne
having
kissed
the
ring
the
director
of
the
grand
séminaire
was
invited
to
sit
down
and
state
his
business
he
said
monseigneur
i
have
sacrificed
to
the
pope
and
to
necessity
all
the
ties
that
bound
me
to
the
royal
house
of
france
i
have
trampled
down
the
dearest
hopes
of
my
heart
which
was
only
what
i
owed
to
the
father
of
the
faithful
and
the
unity
of
the
church
if
his
holiness
raises
me
to
the
see
of
tourcoing
i
will
rule
it
in
his
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
france
a
bishop
is
a
ruling
power
and
i
can
answer
for
my
steadfastness
and
slowly
bending
his
head
as
a
sign
of
approbation
monseigneur
cima
asked
abbé
lantaigne
whether
he
had
been
in
any
way
acquainted
with
duclou
the
late
bishop
of
tourcoing
i
only
knew
him
slightly
replied
lantaigne
and
long
before
his
elevation
to
the
bishopric
i
remember
having
lent
him
some
of
my
sermons
when
i
had
more
of
them
than
i
knew
what
to
do
he
was
not
young
when
we
lost
him
do
you
know
what
caused
his
death
i
do
not
i
knew
duclou
in
rome
he
often
used
to
play
a
rubber
of
whist
with
me
have
you
ever
been
to
rome
lantaigne
never
you
should
go
the
pope
would
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
he
likes
france
very
much
but
you
must
be
careful
when
you
go
the
climate
of
rome
is
bad
for
foreigners
during
the
summer
malaria
is
rife
in
the
countryside
and
even
in
some
parts
of
the
city
the
best
season
to
visit
rome
is
the
spring
i
was
born
in
rome
of
roman
parents
and
i
much
prefer
paris
or
brussels
brussels
is
a
very
pleasant
town
i
have
relations
there
tell
me
tourcoing
is
it
a
very
large
town
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
sees
of
northern
france
monseigneur
and
is
notorious
for
its
long
line
of
saintly
bishops
from
the
blessed
loup
to
monseigneur
de
la
thrumellière
the
immediate
predecessor
of
tell
me
what
are
the
people
of
tourcoing
like
they
are
good
church
people
monseigneur
and
tend
more
to
the
belgian
form
of
catholicism
than
to
the
yes
yes
i
know
duclou
the
late
lamented
bishop
of
tourcoing
told
me
one
day
in
rome
that
he
had
only
one
fault
to
find
with
his
flock
they
drank
beer
he
used
to
say
that
if
they
would
only
drink
the
light
wines
of
orleans
they
would
be
the
most
perfect
christians
in
the
world
but
the
juice
of
the
hop
filled
them
with
its
melancholy
and
monseigneur
allow
me
to
say
one
thing
monseigneur
duclou
was
both
weak
and
brainless
he
never
brought
out
the
energetic
qualities
of
the
sturdy
northerners
under
his
care
he
was
not
a
bad
man
but
his
dislike
of
evil
was
only
moderate
the
catholic
town
of
tourcoing
must
shine
out
on
the
whole
of
the
catholic
world
should
his
holiness
judge
me
worthy
to
fill
the
seat
of
the
blessed
loup
i
swear
in
ten
years
time
to
have
won
all
hearts
by
the
sacred
energy
of
good
works
to
have
stolen
back
all
the
souls
gone
over
to
the
enemy
and
to
around
me
the
oneness
of
belief
in
the
depths
of
her
innermost
soul
france
is
christian
and
only
needs
energetic
leaders
the
church
is
dying
from
sheer
monseigneur
cima
rose
from
his
chair
and
held
out
to
abbé
lantaigne
his
golden
ring
saying
you
must
go
to
rome

you
must
go

the
of
the
house
in
the
grey
batignolles
quarter
was
humble
the
only
decorations
being
copies
of
the
engravings
in
the
louvre
little
statues
cups
and
dishes
of
sèvres
china
ornaments
which
somehow
proclaimed
the
fact
that
the
lady
of
the
house
was
connected
with
government
officials
madame
cheiral
loyer
was
the
sister
of
the
minister
of
justice
and
public
worship
she
was
the
widow
of
a
in
the
rue
d
hauteville
who
had
died
without
leaving
a
penny
and
she
had
attached
herself
to
her
brother
partly
for
the
sake
of
a
home
and
partly
out
of
maternal
ambition
she
ruled
the
old
bachelor
who
ruled
the
country
and
had
forced
him
to
take
as
his
her
son
maurice
who
was
not
fitted
for
anything
in
particular
and
was
good
for
nothing
except
some
public
office
uncle
loyer
had
a
room
in
the
little
flat
of
the
avenue
de
clichy
where
he
came
to
stay
for
a
while
every
spring
at
which
season
he
was
subject
to
attacks
of
giddiness
and
drowsiness
for
he
was
getting
old
as
soon
however
as
his
head
felt
better
and
his
tread
became
more
assured
he
returned
to
the
where
he
had
lived
for
half
a
century
a
room
where
he
had
twice
been
arrested
by
the
agents
of
the
empire
and
from
which
he
could
see
the
trees
of
the
luxembourg
he
still
kept
the
pipe
of
jules
grévy
in
this
garret
of
his
this
pipe
was
perhaps
the
most
treasured
possession
of
the
old
fellow
who
had
gone
through
many
phases
as
a
member
of
parliament
the
days
of
eloquence
and
the
days
of
affairs
he
had
controlled
as
minister
of
the
interior
the
secret
funds
of
three
budgets
he
had
bought
many
a
conscience
for
his
party
a
corrupter
of
others
but
incorruptible
himself
he
had
always
had
an
infinite
indulgence
for
the
hypocrisies
of
his
friends
but
was
jealous
himself
of
retaining
in
the
midst
of
his
power
the
of
a
simulated
poverty
that
was
at
once
cynical
obstinate
and
honourable
his
eye
was
dim
now
and
his
mind
inactive
but
in
the
intervals
when
his
old
skill
and
decisive
spirit
returned
to
him
he
applied
all
his
remaining
vigour
to
concentrated
thought
and
the
game
of
billiards
madame
cheiral
whose
intelligence
was
limited
and
whose
skill
but
moderate
did
what
she
liked
with
the
cunning
quiet
silent
and
old
man
who
for
the
sixth
time
in
his
career
had
been
selected
as
a
member
of
the
cabinet
that
had
followed
upon
the
heels
of
the
clerical
cabinet
and
who
saw
his
nephew
fulfilling
the
indefinite
duties
of
without
an
idea
of
leadership
nor
a
glimmer
of
moral
principle
no
doubt
loyer
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
that
his
nephew
had
reactionary
and
clerical
tendencies
but
he
was
too
much
inclined
to
apoplexy
to
run
the
risk
of
thwarting
his
sister
madame
cheiral
was
staying
at
home
that
day
and
when
madame
called
to
see
her
somewhat
late
in
the
afternoon
when
no
further
callers
were
expected
she
received
her
very
cordially
they
wished
each
other
for
the
wife
was
returning
home
on
the
morrow
going
already
darling
i
must
replied
madame
sweetly
looking
quite
innocent
in
her
black
hat
she
always
affected
this
hat
when
paying
calls
likening
herself
to
a
horse
attached
to
a
funeral
car
you
must
stay
and
dine
with
us
dear
we
so
seldom
see
you
in
paris
we
shall
be
quite
alone
i
don
t
think
my
brother
will
be
here
he
is
so
busy
and
engrossed
in
his
work
just
now
but
perhaps
maurice
will
be
with
us
the
young
men
of
are
much
steadier
than
they
used
to
be
maurice
often
spends
an
evening
at
home
with
she
began
to
try
to
prevail
upon
madame
with
all
the
persuasive
eloquence
of
a
sociable
soul
we
shall
be
quite
among
ourselves
your
dress
will
do
very
nicely
i
assure
you
we
shall
be
absolutely
now
madame
had
obtained
from
the
minister
of
the
interior
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
for
her
husband
she
had
exacted
from
the
minister
of
instruction
and
public
worship
a
promise
that
the
name
of
guitrel
as
candidate
for
the
bishopric
of
tourcoing
should
be
on
the
list
of
candidates
selected
for
the
six
vacant
sees
so
there
was
nothing
to
keep
her
any
longer
in
paris
she
had
intended
to
return
home
that
very
evening
she
excused
herself
saying
that
she
had
so
many
things
to
see
to
but
madame
cheiral
insisted
then
as
madame
persisted
in
her
refusal
she
showed
her
displeasure
by
tightened
lips
and
acid
tones
so
madame
who
had
no
wish
to
annoy
her
gave
in
that
s
right
and
as
i
said
before
we
shall
be
quite
by
they
were
by
themselves
for
loyer
never
came
and
maurice
who
was
expected
did
not
turn
up
either
but
in
their
place
came
a
lady
tobacconist
a
and
a
elementary
school
teacher
the
conversation
was
deep
and
serious
madame
cheiral
who
really
was
only
interested
in
her
own
affairs
and
who
had
no
spite
against
anyone
except
her
dearest
friends
picked
out
the
men
whom
she
thought
worthy
of
the
senate
the
chamber
and
the
institute
not
that
she
cared
about
politics
science
or
literature
but
because
she
thought
it
her
duty
as
the
sister
of
a
cabinet
minister
to
hold
opinions
on
everything
that
contributed
to
the
moral
and
intellectual
greatness
of
her
country
a
the
sale
of
tobacco
in
france
is
controlled
by
the
state
and
given
to
the
widows
and
daughters
of
government
officials
military
and
naval
officers
etc
madame
listened
to
her
with
charming
deference
always
retaining
the
same
air
of
innocence
that
she
reserved
for
people
who
bored
her
when
in
society
she
had
a
way
of
looking
down
which
gave
old
gentlemen
a
thrill
and
which
excited
the
admiration
of
the
instructor
of
grammar
and
gymnastics
who
endeavoured
to
press
her
foot
with
his
own
under
the
table
however
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
return
by
train
from
the
avenue
de
clichy
to
the
where
among
the
radiating
avenues
that
look
like
an
enormous
cross
of
honour
her
boarding
house
was
situated
but
when
she
returned
to
the
on
the
arm
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
rendered
such
signal
services
to
elementary
instruction
she
found
maurice
cheiral
who
had
been
detained
at
the
ministry
and
who
after
dining
at
a
restaurant
had
returned
home
to
dress
prior
to
spending
the
evening
at
a
theatre
he
examined
madame
with
interest
and
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
comfortable
old
couch
that
stood
under
a
great
sèvres
dish
decorated
in
style
and
suspended
on
the
wall
in
a
blue
plush
frame
madame
clavelin
you
are
the
very
person
i
wanted
to
see
in
her
younger
days
madame
had
been
thin
and
dark
and
in
such
guise
had
not
been
unattractive
to
men
as
time
went
on
she
became
fat
and
fair
and
in
this
guise
she
was
again
not
unattractive
to
men
did
you
see
my
uncle
yesterday
yes
he
was
so
sweet
to
me
how
is
he
tired
very
tired
he
gave
me
the
what
papers
the
papers
referring
to
the
candidatures
for
the
six
vacant
sees
you
are
very
anxious
for
abbé
guitrel
to
be
elected
are
you
not
my
husband
is
anxious
your
uncle
told
me
that
the
thing
was
my
uncle
you
should
not
take
any
notice
of
what
he
says
he
is
a
minister
and
can
not
know
people
are
always
fooling
him
and
then
he
often
says
what
he
does
not
mean
why
didn
t
you
come
to
me
with
charming
modesty
madame
replied
in
a
low
voice
well
i
do
come
to
you
and
you
are
wise
to
do
so
replied
the
all
the
more
so
because
the
business
is
not
going
on
as
you
wish
and
it
depends
upon
me
whether
it
proceeds
or
not
my
uncle
told
you
no
doubt
that
he
was
going
to
present
the
six
applications
to
the
pope
well
they
have
already
been
presented
i
know
that
for
i
sent
them
i
take
a
special
interest
in
church
matters
my
uncle
is
one
of
the
old
school
he
does
not
understand
the
importance
of
religion
while
i
realize
it
thoroughly
now
this
is
how
things
stand
the
six
candidates
have
been
presented
to
the
pope
and
the
holy
father
has
only
accepted
four
as
far
as
the
other
two
are
concerned
that
is
guitrel
and
morrue
he
does
not
absolutely
reject
them
but
he
says
he
has
not
yet
sufficient
information
concerning
maurice
cheiral
shook
his
head
gravely
he
has
not
sufficient
information
and
when
he
gets
more
i
do
not
know
what
he
will
say
between
ourselves
dear
lady
guitrel
looks
to
me
a
bit
of
a
rogue
and
we
can
not
be
too
careful
in
choosing
our
bishops
the
clergy
is
a
force
upon
which
a
prudent
government
should
be
able
to
rely
we
are
just
beginning
to
realize
you
are
quite
right
said
madame
clavelin
on
the
other
hand
went
on
the
your
candidate
seems
learned
well
read
and
well
asked
madame
with
a
delightful
smile
it
is
difficult
replied
cheiral
cheiral
was
not
a
very
clever
man
he
took
few
things
into
consideration
and
always
acted
on
reasons
so
futile
that
they
were
difficult
to
unravel
and
so
it
was
thought
that
being
still
young
he
was
swayed
by
personal
motives
at
the
present
time
he
had
just
finished
reading
a
book
by
imbert
de
on
the
tuileries
during
the
second
empire
the
splendour
of
the
brilliant
court
had
particularly
taken
his
fancy
and
the
book
had
fired
him
with
the
desire
to
live
like
the
duc
de
morny
a
life
in
which
politics
should
be
combined
with
pleasure
and
power
of
every
description
he
looked
at
madame
in
a
manner
the
significance
of
which
she
thoroughly
comprehended
as
she
sat
there
silent
with
lowered
gaze
my
uncle
went
on
cheiral
gives
me
a
free
hand
in
this
matter
which
does
not
interest
him
at
all
i
can
set
about
it
in
two
ways
i
can
propose
without
further
delay
the
four
candidates
accepted
by
the
holy
father
or
i
can
tell
the
nuncio
that
things
will
remain
at
a
standstill
until
the
holy
see
has
approved
of
six
candidates
i
have
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
but
should
be
delighted
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
you
shall
i
expect
you
afternoon
at
five
o
clock
and
wait
for
you
in
a
closed
carriage
at
the
end
of
the
rue
vigny
by
the
gates
of
the
park
monceau
there
s
not
much
risk
in
that
thought
madame
her
only
reply
a
slight
quivering
of
her
downcast
lids
chapter
xviii
madame
de
bonmont
had
no
difficulty
in
bringing
raoul
marcien
and
l
abbé
guitrel
together
at
her
house
the
meeting
was
all
that
could
be
desired
for
on
his
part
l
abbé
guitrel
was
full
of
unction
and
raoul
being
a
society
man
knew
what
was
due
to
the
church
monsieur
l
abbé
he
said
i
come
of
a
family
of
priests
and
soldiers
i
have
been
a
soldier
myself
and
that
means
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
for
guitrel
held
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
saying
we
may
call
it
the
alliance
of
the
sword
and
the
then
immediately
resuming
his
priestly
gravity
and
that
is
the
most
natural
and
the
best
of
all
alliances
we
priests
are
soldiers
too
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
very
fond
of
the
madame
de
bonmont
gazed
with
sympathetic
eyes
at
the
abbé
who
continued
in
the
diocese
to
which
i
belong
we
have
started
clubs
where
the
soldiers
can
read
good
books
as
they
smoke
their
cigars
the
work
is
under
the
patronage
of
monseigneur
charlot
and
is
both
flourishing
and
useful
let
us
not
be
unjust
toward
the
age
in
which
we
live
if
it
contains
much
evil
it
also
holds
much
that
is
good
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
fight
and
that
is
perhaps
to
be
preferred
to
the
lukewarm
state
of
those
whom
a
great
christian
poet
has
described
as
being
shut
out
from
both
heaven
and
raoul
approved
of
this
speech
but
ventured
no
reply
he
did
not
answer
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
had
few
ideas
upon
the
subject
and
also
because
his
whole
mind
was
absorbed
in
the
thought
of
the
three
charges
of
cheating
brought
against
him
during
the
past
week
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
follow
any
abstract
or
general
train
of
ideas
madame
de
bonmont
but
dimly
divined
the
real
reason
of
his
silence
and
guitrel
did
not
understand
it
at
all
with
an
honest
desire
to
do
the
right
thing
and
keep
the
ball
of
conversation
going
he
asked
marcien
if
he
knew
colonel
gandouin
he
is
an
excellent
man
in
every
way
added
the
priest
a
fine
example
of
the
christian
and
the
soldier
he
is
respected
by
every
man
in
our
do
i
know
colonel
gandouin
cried
raoul
i
know
him
only
too
well
i
ve
had
enough
of
him
i
can
t
bear
the
man
this
outburst
grieved
madame
de
bonmont
and
startled
guitrel
neither
of
them
knew
that
four
years
before
colonel
gandouin
with
six
other
officers
had
ordered
captain
marcien
to
be
placed
on
for
habitual
dereliction
of
duty
that
offence
selected
from
many
others
being
the
reason
assigned
from
this
moment
the
gentle
elizabeth
gave
up
hoping
that
any
good
would
come
of
the
interview
which
she
had
arranged
to
calm
her
raoul
to
turn
him
away
from
thoughts
of
violence
and
bring
him
back
to
thoughts
of
love
she
opened
her
heart
however
and
in
a
tearful
voice
said
to
the
abbé
don
t
you
think
l
abbé
that
when
a
man
is
young
and
has
a
fine
future
before
him
he
ought
not
to
give
way
to
discouragement
and
depression
ought
he
not
on
the
contrary
to
avoid
all
sad
thoughts
certainly
madame
la
baronne
certainly
replied
l
abbé
guitrel
we
must
never
give
way
to
discouragement
or
abandon
ourselves
to
grief
without
cause
a
good
christian
never
encourages
gloomy
thoughts
madame
la
baronne
that
is
quite
do
you
hear
marcien
asked
madame
de
bonmont
but
raoul
did
not
hear
and
so
the
conversation
dropped
then
madame
de
bonmont
being
a
woman
and
anxious
in
the
midst
of
her
own
worries
to
give
a
little
pleasure
to
guitrel
turned
the
topic
of
conversation
and
so
l
abbé
she
said
your
favourite
stone
is
the
guessing
the
drift
of
her
remark
the
priest
answered
severely
and
even
harshly
do
not
speak
of
that
madame
i
beg
do
not
speak
of
that
chapter
xix
having
risen
early
one
morning
bergeret
professor
of
latin
literature
went
for
a
walk
into
the
country
with
riquet
the
two
loved
each
other
dearly
and
were
nearly
always
together
they
had
the
same
tastes
and
both
preferred
a
quiet
uneventful
and
simple
life
riquet
s
eyes
always
followed
his
master
closely
on
these
walks
he
was
afraid
to
let
him
out
of
his
sight
one
instant
because
he
was
not
very
and
had
he
lost
his
master
could
not
have
tracked
him
again
his
beautiful
loving
look
was
very
engaging
as
he
trotted
by
the
side
of
bergeret
with
an
important
air
quite
pretty
to
see
the
professor
of
latin
literature
walked
slowly
or
quickly
according
to
the
trend
of
his
capricious
fancy
as
soon
as
riquet
was
a
stone
s
throw
ahead
of
his
master
he
turned
round
and
waited
for
him
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
one
of
his
front
paws
lifted
in
an
attitude
of
attention
and
watchfulness
it
did
not
take
much
to
amuse
either
of
them
riquet
plunged
into
gardens
and
shops
alike
coming
out
again
as
hastily
as
he
had
entered
on
this
particular
day
he
bounded
into
the
s
office
to
find
himself
confronted
by
a
huge
pigeon
that
flapped
its
wings
in
the
darkness
to
his
extreme
terror
he
came
as
usual
to
relate
his
adventure
with
eyes
and
paws
and
tail
to
bergeret
who
said
jokingly
yes
indeed
my
poor
riquet
we
have
had
a
terrible
encounter
and
have
escaped
the
claws
and
beak
of
a
winged
monster
that
pigeon
was
an
creature
and
bergeret
smiled
riquet
knew
that
smile
and
knew
that
his
master
was
making
fun
of
him
this
was
a
thing
he
could
not
bear
he
stopped
wagging
his
tail
and
walked
with
hanging
head
back
and
legs
wide
apart
as
a
sign
of
annoyance
my
poor
riquet
said
bergeret
to
him
again
that
bird
which
your
ancestors
would
have
eaten
alive
alarms
you
you
are
not
hungry
as
they
would
have
been
and
you
are
not
as
brave
as
they
were
the
refinement
of
culture
has
made
a
coward
of
you
it
is
questionable
whether
civilization
does
not
tend
to
make
men
less
courageous
as
well
as
less
fierce
but
civilized
man
out
of
respect
for
his
species
affects
courage
and
makes
of
it
an
artificial
virtue
far
more
beautiful
than
the
natural
one
while
as
for
you
you
shamelessly
display
your
riquet
s
annoyance
to
tell
the
truth
was
but
slight
and
only
lasted
a
few
minutes
all
was
forgiven
and
forgotten
when
the
man
and
the
dog
entered
the
josde
woods
just
at
the
hour
when
the
grass
is
wet
with
dew
and
light
mists
rise
from
the
hills
bergeret
loved
the
woods
and
at
sight
of
a
blade
of
grass
would
lose
himself
in
boundless
reveries
riquet
too
loved
the
woods
as
he
sniffed
at
the
dead
leaves
his
soul
was
filled
with
strange
delight
in
deep
meditation
therefore
they
followed
the
pathway
leading
to
the
carrefour
des
demoiselles
when
they
met
a
horseman
returning
to
the
town
it
was
de
terremondre
the
county
councillor
good
day
bergeret
he
cried
reining
in
his
horse
well
have
you
thought
over
my
arguments
of
yesterday
he
had
explained
the
evening
before
at
paillot
s
the
reason
why
he
was
against
the
jews
when
in
the
country
especially
during
the
hunting
season
de
terremondre
s
proclivities
were
when
in
paris
he
dined
with
rich
jews
whom
he
tolerated
to
the
extent
of
inducing
them
to
buy
pictures
at
a
profit
to
himself
at
county
council
meetings
with
due
consideration
to
the
feelings
that
were
paramount
in
his
county
town
he
was
a
nationalist
and
an
but
as
there
were
no
jews
in
that
town
the
crusade
consisted
principally
in
attacks
upon
the
protestants
who
formed
a
small
austere
and
exclusive
community
of
their
own
so
we
are
enemies
went
on
de
terremondre
i
am
sorry
for
that
because
you
are
a
clever
man
but
you
live
quite
outside
the
social
movement
and
are
not
mixed
up
in
public
life
if
you
did
as
i
do
and
entered
into
it
your
sympathies
would
be
you
flatter
me
said
bergeret
the
jewish
race
which
peopled
chaldea
assyria
and
phœnicia
in
former
times
and
which
founded
cities
all
along
the
mediterranean
coast
is
composed
of
jews
scattered
the
world
over
and
also
of
the
countless
arab
populations
of
asia
and
africa
my
heart
is
not
great
enough
to
contain
so
many
hatreds
old
cadmus
was
a
jew
but
i
really
couldn
t
be
the
enemy
of
old
cadmus
you
are
joking
replied
de
terremondre
holding
in
his
horse
who
was
nibbling
at
the
bushes
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
movement
is
directed
solely
against
the
jews
who
have
settled
in
therefore
i
must
hate
persons
said
bergeret
that
is
still
too
many
i
have
not
the
strength
for
it
no
one
asks
you
to
hate
them
said
de
terremondre
but
jews
and
frenchmen
can
not
live
together
the
antagonism
is
ineradicable
it
is
in
the
i
believe
on
the
contrary
said
bergeret
that
the
jews
are
particularly
assimilable
and
have
the
most
plastic
and
malleable
natures
in
the
world
with
the
same
readiness
that
the
niece
of
mardocheus
entered
the
harem
of
ahasuerus
in
bygone
days
so
the
daughters
of
our
jewish
financiers
marry
nowadays
the
heirs
to
the
greatest
names
in
christian
france
after
marriages
such
as
these
it
is
rather
late
in
the
day
to
speak
of
incompatibility
of
race
then
i
think
it
a
bad
thing
to
make
a
distinction
of
race
in
any
country
it
is
not
the
race
that
makes
the
nation
and
there
is
not
a
single
country
in
europe
that
has
not
been
founded
on
a
multitude
of
mixed
and
different
races
when
caesar
entered
gaul
it
was
peopled
by
celts
gauls
iberians
all
differing
in
origin
and
religion
the
tribes
that
set
up
the
cromlechs
were
not
of
the
same
blood
as
those
who
honoured
bards
and
druids
into
this
human
mixture
the
different
invasions
poured
germans
romans
saracens
and
out
of
the
whole
a
nation
arose
the
brave
and
lovable
people
of
france
who
not
so
very
long
ago
were
the
teachers
of
justice
liberty
and
philosophy
to
the
entire
world
think
of
the
beautiful
words
of
renan
i
wish
i
could
remember
them
exactly
what
makes
a
nation
is
the
memory
of
the
great
things
its
people
have
done
together
and
the
will
they
have
to
accomplish
excellent
said
de
terremondre
but
as
i
have
not
the
will
to
accomplish
great
things
with
the
jews
i
remain
an
are
you
quite
sure
that
it
is
possible
for
your
feelings
to
be
wholly
asked
bergeret
i
do
not
understand
you
replied
de
terremondre
then
i
will
explain
myself
said
bergeret
there
is
one
fact
that
never
varies
each
time
there
is
an
attack
on
the
jews
a
goodly
number
of
them
side
with
the
enemy
that
is
just
what
happened
to
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
riquet
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
looked
resignedly
at
his
master
you
will
agree
went
on
bergeret
that
between
the
years
and
titus
was
a
strong
he
took
jotapate
and
exterminated
its
inhabitants
he
conquered
jerusalem
burned
the
temple
and
reduced
to
ashes
and
ruins
the
city
which
afterwards
received
the
name
of
œlia
capitolina
the
candlestick
was
carried
in
his
triumphal
procession
to
rome
and
i
think
without
doing
you
an
injustice
i
may
say
that
that
was
carried
to
a
degree
which
you
people
can
never
hope
to
attain
well
titus
the
destroyer
of
jerusalem
had
many
friends
among
the
jews
berenice
was
deeply
attached
to
him
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
was
against
his
will
and
against
hers
that
he
left
her
flavius
josephus
was
his
friend
and
flavius
was
not
one
of
the
least
of
his
nation
he
was
descended
from
the
asmonean
kings
lived
the
life
of
a
strict
pharisee
and
wrote
greek
correctly
enough
after
the
demolition
of
the
temple
and
holy
city
he
followed
titus
to
rome
and
became
the
intimate
friend
of
the
emperor
he
received
the
freedom
of
the
city
the
title
of
roman
knight
and
a
pension
and
do
not
imagine
monsieur
that
in
so
doing
he
was
betraying
his
race
on
the
contrary
he
remained
faithful
to
the
law
and
applied
himself
to
the
collection
of
national
antiquities
in
short
he
was
a
good
jew
in
his
own
way
and
a
friend
of
titus
now
there
have
always
been
men
like
flavius
in
israel
as
you
pointed
out
i
live
a
secluded
life
and
know
nothing
of
what
goes
on
in
the
world
but
it
would
be
a
great
surprise
to
me
if
at
the
present
crisis
the
jews
were
not
divided
amongst
themselves
and
if
a
great
number
of
them
were
not
on
your
some
of
them
are
with
us
as
you
say
replied
de
terremondre
all
the
more
credit
to
i
thought
as
much
said
bergeret
and
what
is
more
i
am
sure
that
there
are
some
clever
ones
among
them
who
will
make
their
mark
in
this
crusade
against
themselves
about
thirty
years
ago
a
senator
a
very
clever
man
who
admired
the
jewish
faculty
for
getting
on
and
who
cited
as
an
example
a
certain
court
chaplain
of
jewish
origin
used
the
following
words
which
have
since
been
much
quoted
see
said
he
here
is
a
jew
who
has
gone
into
the
church
and
now
he
is
a
monseigneur
let
us
not
revive
the
prejudices
of
barbaric
times
let
us
not
ask
if
a
man
is
a
jew
or
christian
but
only
if
he
is
an
honest
man
and
capable
of
serving
his
de
terremondre
s
horse
began
to
plunge
and
riquet
coming
up
to
his
master
begged
him
with
gentle
loving
look
to
continue
the
interrupted
walk
do
not
run
away
with
the
idea
went
on
de
terremondre
that
i
include
all
jews
in
the
same
blind
feeling
of
dislike
i
have
many
excellent
friends
among
them
but
my
love
for
my
country
makes
an
of
he
held
out
his
hand
to
bergeret
and
turned
his
horse
around
he
was
quietly
proceeding
on
his
way
when
the
professor
called
him
back
hi
a
word
in
your
ear
dear
de
terremondre
now
that
the
die
is
cast
and
that
you
and
your
friends
have
quarrelled
with
the
jews
be
very
careful
that
you
owe
them
nothing
and
give
them
back
the
god
you
have
taken
from
them
for
you
have
taken
their
jehovah
asked
de
terremondre
yes
jehovah
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
beware
of
him
he
was
a
jew
at
heart
and
who
knows
whether
he
has
not
always
remained
a
jew
who
knows
whether
at
this
moment
he
is
not
avenging
his
people
all
that
we
have
seen
lately
the
confessions
that
burst
forth
like
thunderclaps
the
plain
speaking
the
revelations
proceeding
from
all
parts
the
assembly
of
judges
which
you
were
not
able
to
hinder
even
when
you
seemed
who
can
tell
whether
jehovah
has
not
dealt
these
crushing
blows
they
savour
of
his
old
biblical
style
and
i
seem
to
recognize
his
de
terremondre
s
horse
was
already
disappearing
behind
the
bushes
round
the
bend
of
the
path
and
riquet
trotted
along
contentedly
through
the
grass
beware
repeated
bergeret
do
not
keep
their
chapter
xx
madame
came
along
through
the
rainy
darkness
holding
up
her
umbrella
and
walking
with
the
brisk
decided
step
which
for
a
wonder
had
not
grown
heavy
from
long
years
spent
in
provincial
towns
the
door
of
the
carriage
that
was
waiting
for
her
in
front
of
the
gates
of
the
park
monceau
opened
a
little
and
then
stood
wide
and
madame
slipped
calmly
in
and
took
a
seat
beside
the
young
secretary
who
immediately
inquired
as
to
her
health
i
am
always
well
she
replied
adding
what
awful
weather
streams
of
rain
were
running
down
the
carriage
windows
the
street
noises
were
drowned
in
the
damp
air
and
all
that
could
be
heard
was
the
gentle
drip
of
the
raindrops
when
the
carriage
began
to
roll
with
a
muffled
sound
over
the
paved
road
she
asked
where
are
we
going
where
you
i
don
t
mind
neuilly
way
i
should
having
given
instructions
to
the
driver
maurice
cheiral
turned
to
the
wife
and
said
i
have
much
pleasure
in
informing
you
that
the
appointment
of
abbé
guitrel
joachim
to
the
see
of
tourcoing
will
be
announced
in
s
i
do
not
want
to
boast
but
i
can
assure
you
that
it
has
not
been
a
very
easy
matter
to
arrange
the
nuncio
is
great
at
procrastination
people
of
that
description
make
use
of
a
prodigious
amount
of
inactivity
well
anyhow
everything
is
that
s
good
replied
madame
i
am
sure
you
have
rendered
a
service
to
the
progressive
republican
party
and
that
the
moderates
will
have
every
reason
to
be
pleased
with
their
new
at
any
rate
went
on
maurice
cheiral
you
are
after
a
long
silence
he
continued
just
think
i
never
slept
all
night
i
was
thinking
of
you
and
longing
to
see
you
the
strange
thing
was
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
and
that
the
expectation
of
this
rendezvous
had
excited
him
but
he
spoke
in
a
joking
tone
and
drawling
voice
that
made
his
words
appear
false
besides
which
he
was
wanting
both
in
assurance
and
decision
madame
quite
thought
she
would
leave
the
carriage
as
she
had
entered
it
assuming
a
serious
and
gentle
expression
she
said
in
a
sympathetic
tone
thank
you
dear
cheiral
put
me
down
here
if
you
please
and
remember
me
to
your
and
she
held
out
her
hand
a
little
stumpy
hand
clad
in
an
exceedingly
dirty
glove
but
he
held
it
tightly
becoming
tender
and
insistent
full
of
desire
and
i
am
as
muddy
as
a
water
spaniel
she
remarked
just
as
he
was
about
to
find
that
out
for
himself
while
he
adhered
to
his
resolve
in
spite
of
the
obstacles
of
circumstances
and
environment
she
showed
the
most
perfect
good
taste
and
simplicity
with
wonderful
tact
she
avoided
all
the
unpleasantness
arising
from
an
resistance
or
a
too
rapid
resignation
in
like
manner
she
avoided
any
remark
that
might
reveal
either
ironical
indifference
or
interested
participation
she
behaved
perfectly
she
had
no
feeling
of
dislike
for
the
young
statesman
who
was
so
innocent
at
the
very
moment
when
he
believed
himself
to
be
so
wicked
and
feelings
of
real
regret
came
over
her
as
she
reflected
that
she
might
have
been
more
careful
in
selecting
her
for
the
occasion
she
never
had
been
careful
enough
of
that
but
of
late
years
her
carelessness
had
become
somewhat
excessive
her
greatest
merit
on
this
occasion
was
in
keeping
clear
of
all
emphasis
and
exaggeration
after
a
while
maurice
suddenly
became
quiet
indifferent
even
a
trifle
bored
he
talked
of
things
quite
foreign
to
their
present
situation
and
peered
through
the
blurred
at
the
streets
that
looked
as
though
the
carriage
were
going
along
at
the
bottom
of
an
aquarium
all
that
could
be
seen
through
the
rain
was
the
and
here
and
there
the
glass
jars
in
the
windows
of
the
chemists
shops
what
awful
rain
sighed
madame
the
weather
has
been
dreadful
for
the
last
week
said
maurice
cheiral
simply
rotten
is
it
the
same
in
your
part
of
the
country
we
get
more
rain
in
our
department
than
in
any
other
in
france
replied
madame
with
charming
sweetness
but
there
is
never
any
mud
on
the
broad
gravelled
garden
paths
of
the
préfecture
then
we
country
people
wear
do
you
know
said
cheiral
that
i
have
never
been
to
your
town
there
are
beautiful
walks
there
replied
madame
and
the
surroundings
are
charming
do
come
and
see
us
my
husband
would
be
does
your
husband
like
living
there
yes
he
likes
it
because
he
has
been
successful
in
her
turn
she
tried
to
see
through
the
clouded
panes
and
to
pierce
the
thick
darkness
that
was
full
of
fugitive
glimmers
of
light
where
are
we
she
asked
far
away
from
everywhere
i
should
think
he
replied
eagerly
where
would
you
like
me
to
put
you
down
she
asked
him
to
stop
at
a
station
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
his
anxiety
to
leave
her
i
must
go
to
the
chambre
he
said
i
do
not
know
what
they
have
been
doing
ah
they
were
sitting
yes
he
replied
but
there
was
nothing
of
importance
i
believe
an
increase
of
tariff
but
one
never
knows
i
had
better
just
look
they
took
leave
of
one
another
easily
and
amicably
as
madame
stepped
into
a
fiacre
in
the
boulevard
de
courcelles
near
the
fortifications
she
heard
the
newsboys
crying
the
evening
papers
and
holding
them
out
to
the
as
they
hurried
along
she
caught
sight
of
a
heading
in
huge
letters
fall
of
the
madame
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
men
and
listening
to
the
voices
dying
away
in
the
rainy
night
she
reflected
that
if
loyer
were
really
going
to
send
in
his
resignation
to
the
president
of
the
republic
there
would
be
in
all
probability
no
notice
in
s
of
the
new
appointments
in
the
church
she
reflected
that
her
husband
s
decoration
would
not
be
included
in
the
last
will
and
testament
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
and
that
hence
the
she
had
spent
in
the
fiacre
was
of
no
avail
she
had
no
regret
over
what
had
happened
but
did
not
like
doing
things
to
no
purpose
neuilly
she
said
to
the
driver
boulevard
bineau
the
convent
of
the
dames
du
and
she
sat
pensive
and
solitary
while
the
cries
of
the
newsvendors
filled
her
ears
and
she
tried
to
convince
herself
that
the
news
was
true
she
would
not
buy
a
paper
however
partly
out
of
mistrust
and
contempt
for
all
newspaper
matter
and
partly
because
she
was
determined
not
to
rob
herself
of
so
much
as
a
she
reflected
that
if
the
ministry
really
had
fallen
just
at
the
moment
when
she
was
being
so
prodigal
of
her
favours
it
was
a
striking
example
of
the
irony
of
things
and
the
spite
that
hovers
ceaselessly
about
us
like
the
very
atmosphere
we
breathe
she
asked
herself
whether
loyer
s
had
not
known
the
news
that
was
now
being
shouted
abroad
while
he
waited
for
her
at
the
park
gates
at
this
thought
she
grew
scarlet
as
though
her
chastity
had
been
outraged
and
her
faith
betrayed
for
if
that
were
the
case
maurice
cheiral
had
been
making
game
of
her
and
that
she
could
not
endure
however
her
sound
common
sense
and
wide
experience
soon
came
to
her
aid
assuring
her
that
it
was
never
safe
to
trust
the
newspapers
she
thought
of
abbé
guitrel
without
a
qualm
and
congratulated
herself
on
having
contributed
in
ever
so
small
a
degree
to
the
elevation
of
the
excellent
priest
to
the
see
of
the
blessed
saint
loup
she
arranged
a
few
little
details
of
her
toilet
the
while
so
that
she
might
present
a
good
appearance
in
the
parlour
of
the
dames
du
who
were
charged
with
the
education
of
her
daughter
the
fog
was
paler
and
less
dense
in
the
deserted
avenues
and
the
low
damp
streets
of
neuilly
through
the
gentle
rain
the
strong
graceful
outlines
of
the
great
bare
trees
were
visible
madame
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
poplars
and
they
reminded
her
of
the
country
which
she
loved
more
dearly
every
day
she
reached
the
barred
doorway
crowned
with
a
stone
shield
bearing
the
glove
in
which
joseph
of
arimathea
received
the
sacred
blood
of
the
saviour
and
rang
the
bell
at
her
request
the
portress
sent
for
mademoiselle
de
clavelin
and
madame
entered
the
bright
parlour
with
its
horsehair
chairs
as
she
sat
there
before
a
picture
of
the
virgin
extending
her
hands
the
wife
was
filled
with
a
strong
sweet
feeling
of
religion
she
was
not
wholly
a
christian
because
she
had
never
been
baptized
but
her
daughter
had
been
baptized
and
was
being
brought
up
in
the
catholic
faith
together
with
the
republic
madame
felt
strong
leanings
towards
a
conventional
piety
and
with
a
sincere
uplifting
of
the
heart
she
saluted
the
kind
virgin
to
whom
ladies
like
herself
poured
out
their
troubles
and
necessities
she
thanked
providence
for
all
her
blessings
as
she
sat
before
the
picture
of
mary
with
her
outstretched
arms
and
she
thanked
the
virgin
with
a
mystical
intensity
that
the
jewish
religion
had
never
been
able
to
satisfy
she
was
full
of
gratitude
to
god
who
had
guided
her
from
the
miserable
days
of
her
childhood
in
montmartre
when
she
had
run
about
the
greasy
streets
of
the
outer
boulevards
in
her
shoes
until
the
present
time
when
she
mixed
in
the
best
society
belonged
to
the
ruling
classes
and
had
a
share
in
the
affairs
that
governed
the
country
and
she
thanked
god
that
in
all
her
negotiations
for
life
is
difficult
and
one
often
needs
the
help
of
others
she
had
at
any
rate
never
had
to
come
into
contact
with
any
but
men
of
position
in
the
world
good
evening
mother
madame
drew
her
daughter
under
the
lamp
and
examined
her
teeth
that
was
always
her
first
care
then
she
looked
at
her
eyes
to
see
whether
she
were
anæmic
or
not
saw
that
her
back
was
straight
and
that
she
did
not
bite
her
nails
when
satisfied
on
all
these
points
she
inquired
as
to
her
work
and
her
conduct
her
solicitude
was
full
of
sound
common
sense
and
much
experience
and
altogether
she
was
an
excellent
mother
when
at
last
the
bell
rang
for
evening
study
and
it
was
time
to
say
madame
drew
from
her
pocket
a
box
of
chocolates
the
box
was
crushed
broken
dilapidated
and
as
flat
as
a
pancake
mademoiselle
de
clavelin
took
it
saying
with
a
laugh
oh
mother
it
looks
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
wars
it
is
this
dreadful
weather
said
madame
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
that
evening
after
dinner
at
the
she
found
on
the
table
a
evening
paper
whose
information
she
knew
to
be
well
authenticated
on
reading
it
she
learned
that
the
government
had
not
fallen
and
was
not
even
in
difficulties
it
is
true
that
it
had
been
in
the
minority
at
the
commencement
of
the
sitting
but
that
was
only
on
the
order
of
the
day
and
it
had
immediately
been
followed
by
a
majority
of
the
news
delighted
her
and
as
she
thought
of
her
husband
she
said
to
herself
lucien
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
guitrel
has
been
made
chapter
xxi
ask
guitrel
to
come
in
said
loyer
seated
at
his
desk
the
minister
was
hardly
visible
behind
the
heaps
of
paper
piled
upon
it
he
was
a
little
spectacled
old
man
with
a
grey
moustache
watery
eyes
and
a
sniff
a
cynical
cantankerous
old
fellow
but
an
honest
man
who
in
spite
of
the
power
and
honour
that
had
fallen
to
his
lot
still
had
the
appearance
and
manner
of
a
professor
of
the
law
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
wiped
them
for
he
was
curious
to
see
the
abbé
the
candidate
to
the
episcopal
dignity
who
had
been
backed
by
so
many
brilliant
society
women
madame
de
gromance
the
pretty
provincial
had
been
the
first
to
call
upon
him
at
the
end
of
december
she
had
told
him
without
beating
about
the
bush
that
he
must
appoint
the
abbé
guitrel
to
the
see
of
tourcoing
the
old
minister
who
still
loved
the
perfume
that
clings
to
a
pretty
woman
had
kept
the
little
hand
of
madame
de
gromance
for
a
long
time
between
his
stroking
with
his
thumb
the
bare
space
between
the
glove
and
the
sleeve
where
over
the
blue
veins
the
skin
is
softest
he
had
not
gone
further
however
because
he
was
getting
old
and
everything
was
an
effort
to
him
and
also
he
was
afraid
of
appearing
ridiculous
in
her
eyes
for
he
still
had
his
share
of
vanity
his
words
alone
savoured
of
impropriety
and
according
to
his
invariable
custom
he
inquired
for
madame
de
gromance
s
old
royalist
as
he
familiarly
called
her
husband
his
eyes
had
become
tearful
behind
their
bluish
glasses
and
his
face
had
creased
itself
into
a
thousand
little
wrinkles
at
the
excellence
of
the
jest
the
idea
that
the
old
royalist
was
a
wronged
husband
filled
the
minister
of
justice
and
public
worship
with
what
really
was
inordinate
glee
as
he
thought
of
it
he
looked
at
madame
de
gromance
with
more
curiosity
interest
and
pleasure
than
was
perhaps
in
the
case
justifiable
but
from
the
ruins
of
his
amorous
nature
he
was
building
a
series
of
mental
amusements
the
most
intense
of
which
was
to
gloat
over
the
misfortune
of
de
gromance
in
the
very
presence
of
its
voluptuous
cause
during
the
six
months
in
which
he
had
been
minister
of
the
interior
in
a
former
radical
cabinet
he
had
received
from
private
and
confidential
notes
telling
him
all
about
the
gromance
ménage
so
that
he
knew
all
there
was
to
know
about
clotilde
s
lovers
and
delighted
in
the
knowledge
that
they
were
numerous
he
had
received
the
beautiful
petitioner
with
every
kindness
promising
to
look
into
guitrel
s
case
but
committing
himself
no
further
for
he
was
a
good
republican
and
did
not
believe
in
subordinating
affairs
of
state
to
a
woman
s
caprice
then
too
the
baronne
de
bonmont
who
was
reputed
to
have
the
most
beautiful
shoulders
in
paris
had
spoken
in
favour
of
abbé
guitrel
at
the
élysée
soirées
finally
madame
the
wife
a
very
charming
woman
had
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
concerning
the
good
abbé
loyer
was
very
curious
to
see
the
priest
who
had
fluttered
so
many
feminine
hearts
he
wondered
whether
he
was
about
to
behold
one
of
the
great
sturdy
becassocked
fellows
that
of
latter
days
the
church
has
thrown
into
public
gatherings
sending
them
as
far
even
as
the
chamber
of
deputies
one
of
those
young
outspoken
clerical
tribunes
of
the
people
headstrong
and
shrewd
with
a
power
over
simple
men
and
women
the
abbé
guitrel
entered
the
study
his
head
upon
one
side
and
holding
his
hat
before
him
in
his
clasped
hands
he
was
not
unprepossessing
but
his
desire
to
please
and
his
respect
for
the
powers
that
be
made
his
habitual
carefully
assumed
priestly
dignity
less
apparent
than
usual
loyer
noticed
his
three
chins
and
domed
head
his
portly
form
his
narrow
shoulders
and
his
unctuousness
he
was
quite
an
old
man
too
what
do
the
women
want
with
him
he
thought
the
interview
was
trifling
on
either
side
but
after
questioning
guitrel
on
some
points
of
ecclesiastical
administration
loyer
gathered
from
the
fat
man
s
replies
that
his
views
were
both
sensible
and
fair
he
remembered
that
the
director
of
public
worship
mostart
was
not
against
the
nomination
of
abbé
guitrel
to
the
see
of
tourcoing
truth
to
tell
mostart
had
not
given
him
much
information
on
the
subject
since
there
had
been
such
a
rapid
succession
of
clerical
and
anticlerical
cabinets
the
director
of
public
worship
had
not
dabbled
overmuch
in
the
making
of
bishops
the
matter
had
become
too
delicate
of
handling
he
had
a
house
at
joinville
and
was
fond
of
gardening
and
fishing
his
dearest
dream
was
to
write
a
chatty
history
of
the
bobino
theatre
which
he
had
known
in
its
palmy
days
he
was
growing
old
was
a
prudent
man
and
did
not
stick
obstinately
to
his
own
opinion
the
evening
before
he
had
said
to
loyer
i
propose
abbé
guitrel
but
there
s
nothing
to
choose
between
abbé
guitrel
and
abbé
lantaigne
it
s
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
those
were
the
very
words
of
the
director
of
public
worship
but
loyer
was
himself
an
old
doctor
at
law
and
always
able
to
make
nice
distinctions
guitrel
seemed
to
him
sensible
enough
and
not
too
fanatical
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
monsieur
l
abbé
he
said
that
the
late
bishop
of
tourcoing
duclou
tended
to
become
intolerant
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
and
gave
an
unreasonable
amount
of
work
to
the
council
of
state
what
is
your
opinion
on
the
subject
alas
replied
the
abbé
guitrel
with
a
sigh
it
is
quite
true
that
in
his
declining
years
as
he
neared
the
period
of
eternal
blessedness
monseigneur
duclou
made
some
rather
unfortunate
declarations
the
situation
was
a
difficult
one
then
but
things
have
greatly
altered
and
his
successor
will
be
able
to
labour
quietly
towards
the
establishment
of
peace
what
he
will
have
to
aim
at
is
real
peace
the
road
to
it
is
marked
he
will
have
to
enter
upon
it
resolutely
and
follow
it
to
the
end
as
a
matter
of
fact
laws
dealing
with
education
and
the
army
do
not
give
rise
nowadays
to
any
difficulties
and
all
that
really
remains
is
the
question
of
the
taxation
of
religious
communities
this
question
we
must
allow
is
peculiarly
important
in
a
diocese
like
tourcoing
which
if
i
may
say
so
is
plastered
with
all
kinds
of
religious
institutions
i
have
studied
it
at
length
and
if
you
wish
can
speak
of
the
conclusions
to
which
this
study
has
led
the
clergy
said
loyer
dislike
parting
with
their
money
that
is
the
nobody
likes
it
monsieur
le
ministre
returned
abbé
guitrel
and
your
excellency
such
an
adept
in
all
that
relates
to
finance
must
realize
that
there
is
a
way
of
shearing
the
ratepayer
without
making
him
complain
why
not
use
the
same
method
with
our
poor
monks
who
are
too
good
frenchmen
not
to
be
good
ratepayers
you
must
bear
in
mind
monsieur
le
ministre
that
they
are
subject
in
the
first
case
to
the
ordinary
taxes
that
everybody
naturally
put
in
loyer
secondly
to
taxes
on
inalienable
and
do
you
complain
of
that
inquired
the
minister
not
at
all
replied
the
abbé
i
am
merely
enumerating
them
all
quick
reckonings
make
long
friends
thirdly
to
a
tax
of
four
per
cent
on
the
income
accruing
from
lands
houses
furniture
and
money
and
fourthly
they
are
liable
to
the
increment
duty
as
established
by
the
laws
of
the
of
december
and
the
of
december
it
is
only
the
principle
underlying
this
last
tax
as
you
know
monsieur
le
ministre
that
has
been
contested
by
several
communities
the
agitation
has
not
yet
died
down
everywhere
and
it
is
on
this
point
monsieur
le
ministre
that
i
take
the
liberty
of
expressing
the
views
which
would
actuate
me
were
i
to
have
the
honour
of
occupying
the
see
of
the
blessed
saint
as
a
sign
of
attention
the
minister
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
faced
the
abbé
who
went
on
in
the
following
terms
as
a
matter
of
principle
monsieur
le
ministre
i
disapprove
of
the
spirit
of
revolt
and
dislike
any
tumultuous
or
systematic
claiming
of
rights
and
in
this
i
only
comply
with
the
encyclical
beginning
in
which
leo
xiii
following
the
example
of
paul
exhorts
his
people
to
obedience
towards
the
civil
authorities
so
much
for
principle
let
us
now
look
fact
in
the
face
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
find
that
the
religious
in
the
diocese
of
tourcoing
are
placed
in
such
different
positions
with
regard
to
rates
and
taxes
that
universality
of
action
is
thereby
rendered
exceedingly
difficult
in
this
diocese
there
are
authorized
and
unauthorized
communities
some
communities
dedicated
to
works
of
charity
among
the
poor
the
aged
and
the
orphan
and
some
whose
sole
aim
and
object
is
a
life
of
spiritual
contemplation
they
are
taxed
differently
according
to
their
different
purposes
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
very
opposition
of
their
interests
breaks
down
resistance
unless
their
bishop
himself
directs
the
tenor
of
their
claims
a
thing
which
for
my
part
i
should
avoid
if
i
were
their
spiritual
head
i
would
willingly
see
uncertainty
and
division
among
the
communities
of
my
diocese
if
by
so
doing
i
could
ensure
the
peace
of
the
church
as
a
whole
as
far
as
my
secular
clergy
were
concerned
added
the
priest
in
a
firm
voice
i
would
answer
for
them
as
a
general
answers
for
his
having
thus
spoken
guitrel
apologized
for
having
given
such
free
vent
to
his
thoughts
and
wasted
the
precious
time
of
his
excellency
old
loyer
made
no
answer
but
he
nodded
approval
for
a
parson
guitrel
was
not
so
difficult
to
get
on
with
after
all
he
thought
chapter
xxii
madame
de
bonmont
dismissed
her
carriage
and
hailing
a
cab
drove
to
the
street
where
amid
the
rumble
of
drays
and
the
whistle
of
engines
she
carried
on
her
love
affair
she
would
have
preferred
to
see
her
rara
in
a
region
adorned
with
gardens
but
love
is
sometimes
shy
under
the
myrtles
or
by
the
murmuring
fountains
madame
de
bonmont
s
thoughts
were
sad
as
she
drove
along
the
streets
where
the
lamps
were
just
beginning
to
glimmer
through
the
misty
evening
light
guitrel
had
indeed
been
appointed
bishop
of
tourcoing
and
she
rejoiced
thereat
but
joy
did
not
possess
her
soul
completely
rara
with
his
black
humour
and
ferocious
desires
worried
her
terribly
now
she
went
in
fear
and
trembling
to
the
rendezvous
to
which
in
former
times
she
had
so
eagerly
looked
forward
confiding
and
retiring
by
nature
she
dreaded
on
his
account
as
well
as
her
own
anything
in
the
nature
of
danger
catastrophe
or
scandal
her
lover
s
mental
attitude
which
had
never
been
satisfactory
had
quite
suddenly
grown
worse
since
the
suicide
of
colonel
henry
he
had
become
dreadful
to
look
upon
the
bitterness
in
his
blood
had
acted
like
vitriol
upon
his
countenance
as
it
were
searing
his
forehead
his
eyelids
his
cheeks
with
marks
of
fire
and
brimstone
for
the
last
fortnight
mysterious
causes
had
kept
her
dear
one
absent
from
the
flat
which
he
rented
opposite
the
and
which
was
his
legal
domicile
he
had
his
letters
forwarded
to
him
and
received
visitors
in
the
little
suite
which
madame
de
bonmont
had
taken
for
quite
a
different
use
slowly
and
sadly
she
went
up
the
stairs
but
even
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
door
the
hope
of
finding
the
delightful
rara
of
former
days
stirred
her
heart
alas
her
hope
was
vain
she
was
greeted
with
bitter
words
what
do
you
come
here
for
you
despise
me
like
all
the
she
protested
at
such
cruelty
she
did
not
despise
him
on
the
contrary
her
loving
animal
nature
led
her
to
admire
him
she
put
her
painted
yet
youthful
lips
to
her
lover
s
mouth
and
kissed
him
sobbingly
but
pushing
her
away
he
began
to
pace
furiously
up
and
down
the
two
rooms
noiselessly
she
untied
the
little
parcel
of
cakes
she
had
brought
with
her
and
said
in
a
hopeless
toneless
voice
will
you
have
a
it
is
kirsch
just
as
you
like
them
and
she
handed
him
the
cake
between
two
dainty
sugary
fingers
but
he
refused
to
see
or
hear
her
and
continued
his
fierce
monotonous
promenade
then
with
eyes
and
bosom
that
heaved
with
sighs
she
lifted
the
thick
black
veil
which
covered
the
upper
part
of
her
face
and
silently
commenced
to
eat
a
chocolate
at
last
however
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
to
say
she
took
a
from
her
pocket
and
opening
it
displayed
for
rara
the
bishop
s
ring
which
it
contained
saying
in
a
timid
voice
look
at
guitrel
s
ring
it
is
a
pretty
stone
isn
t
it
it
is
an
hungarian
amethyst
do
you
think
guitrel
will
like
it
i
don
t
care
a
damn
she
put
the
case
down
on
the
toilet
table
in
despair
while
he
resuming
the
usual
current
of
his
thoughts
growled
out
there
s
no
mistake
about
it
i
will
do
for
one
of
them
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
for
she
had
noticed
that
he
was
always
threatening
to
kill
everybody
and
that
he
killed
no
one
he
divined
her
hidden
thought
it
was
dreadful
i
knew
that
you
despised
me
too
he
said
he
nearly
struck
her
and
she
wept
bitterly
eventually
he
calmed
down
however
and
drew
her
a
terrible
picture
of
his
financial
embarrassments
she
wept
at
the
picture
but
did
not
promise
to
give
him
much
because
it
was
against
her
principles
to
give
money
to
a
lover
and
besides
she
feared
he
might
go
away
altogether
if
he
had
the
means
to
do
so
when
she
left
the
little
blue
rooms
she
was
so
upset
that
she
quite
forgot
the
amethyst
ring
lying
on
the
toilet
table
chapter
xxiii
are
you
working
dear
master
do
i
disturb
you
asked
goubin
entering
bergeret
s
study
not
at
all
replied
the
professor
i
was
amusing
myself
by
translating
a
greek
text
of
the
alexandrine
period
discovered
in
a
tomb
at
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
read
me
your
translation
dear
master
said
goubin
with
pleasure
replied
bergeret
and
he
began
concerning
hercules
atimos
deeds
are
commonly
ascribed
to
the
one
and
only
hercules
which
in
reality
have
been
accomplished
by
other
heroes
bearing
the
same
name
that
which
orpheus
teaches
us
concerning
the
thracian
hercules
relates
to
the
god
rather
than
to
the
hero
i
will
not
dwell
upon
this
the
tyrians
tell
of
another
hercules
to
whom
they
attribute
labours
so
prodigious
that
they
are
difficult
to
accept
what
is
less
known
is
that
alcmena
gave
birth
to
twins
who
were
exactly
alike
and
who
each
received
the
name
of
hercules
the
one
was
the
son
of
jupiter
and
the
other
of
amphitryon
on
account
of
his
great
deeds
the
former
attained
the
right
to
drink
from
the
cup
of
hebe
at
the
table
of
the
gods
and
we
look
upon
him
as
a
god
the
second
was
unworthy
that
is
why
he
was
called
hercules
atimos
what
i
know
of
him
i
have
learned
from
an
inhabitant
of
eleusis
a
wise
and
prudent
man
who
has
collected
together
many
ancient
legends
this
is
what
he
told
me
hercules
atimos
the
son
of
amphitryon
when
nearing
manhood
received
from
his
father
a
bow
and
arrows
forged
by
vulcan
which
dealt
certain
death
to
any
creature
whom
they
struck
now
one
day
when
shooting
wild
cranes
on
the
slopes
of
cithæron
he
met
a
herdsman
who
addressed
him
thus
son
of
amphitryon
there
is
an
evil
man
who
daily
steals
some
of
our
cattle
thou
art
full
of
youth
and
vigour
if
thou
canst
find
the
thief
and
strike
him
with
one
of
thy
magic
arrows
thou
wilt
gain
great
praise
but
he
is
not
easy
of
approach
for
his
feet
are
larger
than
the
feet
of
other
men
and
he
is
very
atimos
promised
the
herdsman
that
he
would
punish
the
brigand
and
went
upon
his
way
hiding
in
the
mountain
gorges
he
saw
at
a
distance
the
figure
of
a
man
who
appeared
to
him
evil
thinking
it
was
the
he
killed
him
with
his
arrows
but
while
the
man
s
blood
was
still
fresh
upon
the
wild
anemones
pallas
athene
the
goddess
descended
from
olympus
and
came
to
meet
atimos
who
did
not
recognize
her
for
she
was
disguised
as
an
old
servant
of
king
amphitryon
and
the
goddess
spoke
to
him
thus
divine
son
of
amphitryon
the
man
thou
hast
killed
was
not
a
stealer
of
cattle
but
a
good
man
the
guilty
man
is
easily
recognized
by
the
print
of
his
feet
in
the
dust
for
they
are
larger
than
those
of
other
men
the
dead
man
s
conduct
was
irreproachable
and
his
life
a
life
of
innocence
therefore
shalt
thou
pray
with
tears
to
the
divine
apollo
to
restore
him
to
life
apollo
will
not
refuse
thy
request
if
thou
pleadest
with
outstretched
supplicating
full
of
anger
however
atimos
replied
i
have
punished
this
man
for
his
wickedness
dost
thou
think
old
man
that
i
know
not
what
i
do
and
strike
at
random
peace
get
thee
gone
thou
madman
or
thou
shalt
repent
thy
some
young
shepherds
who
were
gambolling
with
their
goats
upon
the
slopes
of
cithæron
hearing
the
words
of
atimos
received
them
with
such
shouts
of
praise
that
the
mountain
resounded
and
the
ancient
pine
trees
stirred
and
quivered
and
pallas
athene
the
goddess
returned
to
snowy
olympus
atimos
however
had
resumed
his
journey
and
soon
found
himself
upon
the
tracks
of
the
whom
he
could
see
at
a
little
distance
ahead
he
recognized
him
quite
easily
by
his
footprints
in
the
sand
for
they
were
much
greater
than
those
of
other
men
then
thought
the
hero
to
himself
it
is
necessary
that
men
believe
in
the
innocence
of
this
man
so
that
they
may
believe
i
have
slain
the
guilty
one
and
that
my
glory
be
made
known
among
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
he
called
the
man
and
said
to
him
friend
i
honour
thee
because
thou
art
good
and
thy
thoughts
then
drawing
from
his
quiver
one
of
the
arrows
made
by
vulcan
he
gave
it
to
the
man
with
these
words
take
this
arrow
made
by
vulcan
all
those
who
see
thee
with
it
will
honour
thee
and
thou
wilt
be
judged
worthy
of
the
friendship
of
a
thus
spoke
he
the
thief
took
the
arrow
and
went
away
and
divine
athene
the
goddess
descended
from
snowy
olympus
she
disguised
herself
as
a
gentle
shepherd
and
coming
up
to
atimos
said
son
of
amphitryon
in
absolving
the
guilty
man
thou
hast
killed
the
innocent
a
second
time
and
this
action
shall
not
bring
thee
glory
among
but
atimos
did
not
recognize
the
goddess
and
believing
her
to
be
a
shepherd
he
cried
in
fury
vain
babbler
dog
i
will
tear
out
thy
soul
and
he
lifted
against
pallas
athene
his
bow
the
wood
of
which
was
harder
than
the
iron
of
the
arrows
forged
by
vulcan
the
rest
is
missing
said
bergeret
replacing
the
papers
upon
his
table
what
a
pity
said
goubin
it
is
a
pity
said
bergeret
i
have
been
much
interested
in
translating
this

have
a
change
sometimes
from

chapter
xxiv
as
evening
fell
madame
de
bonmont
with
anxious
heart
hailed
a
cab
and
drove
to
rara
s
rooms
for
she
wished
to
see
him
again
and
to
recover
the
amethyst
ring
but
she
feared
some
disaster
when
the
cab
crossed
the
pont
de
l
europe
and
stopped
in
front
of
her
lover
s
door
she
saw
that
the
road
was
black
with
hats
and
coats
something
was
going
on
that
reminded
her
of
a
funeral
or
a
removal
men
were
heaping
portfolios
and
piles
of
papers
into
a
cab
others
were
bringing
along
a
little
box
which
madame
de
bonmont
recognised
as
the
old
military
trunk
filled
with
stamped
papers
in
which
rara
had
so
often
plunged
his
flushed
arms
and
his
furious
hairy
visage
as
she
stood
there
frozen
with
terror
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
dishevelled
whisper
in
her
ear
don
t
come
in
be
off
as
fast
as
you
can
the
police
are
here
with
the
magistrate
and
the
commissioner
they
have
seized
your
gentleman
s
papers
and
sealed
up
the
cab
carried
away
a
prostrate
madame
de
bonmont
in
the
depths
of
despair
at
her
lost
love
she
was
however
conscious
of
this
thought
and
monseigneur
guitrel
s
ring
which
has
been
sealed
with
the
rest
chapter
xxv
people
had
been
talking
about
it
for
three
months
bergeret
learned
that
he
had
friends
in
paris
who
had
never
seen
him
and
friends
such
as
these
are
the
surest
their
actions
are
governed
by
sensible
masterly
positive
reasons
and
if
only
their
report
is
favourable
they
are
sure
of
a
hearing
bergeret
s
friends
thought
that
his
place
was
in
paris
and
suggested
bringing
him
there
leterrier
did
all
he
could
to
bring
this
about
and
at
last
it
was
arranged
bergeret
was
appointed
professor
at
the
sorbonne
as
he
left
the
house
of
le
doyen
torquet
who
had
apprised
him
in
the
most
formal
terms
of
his
nomination
bergeret
finding
himself
in
the
street
again
looked
at
the
slate
roofs
the
familiar
walls
the
shaving
basin
that
swung
gently
to
and
fro
over
the
door
of
the
hairdresser
the
sign
of
the
red
cow
over
the
milkman
s
and
the
little
bronze
triton
with
water
streaming
from
his
mouth
at
the
corner
of
the
faubourg
de
josde
and
all
these
familiar
things
appeared
suddenly
strange
in
his
eyes
his
feet
had
suddenly
become
unacquainted
with
the
pavements
on
which
he
had
so
long
and
so
often
gone
his
way
with
feet
rendered
heavy
by
sadness
or
fatigue
or
made
light
by
some
slight
happiness
or
amusement
the
town
with
its
towers
and
steeples
standing
up
against
the
grey
sky
looked
to
him
like
some
strange
dream
city
rather
the
picture
of
a
city
than
the
reality
and
the
picture
grew
smaller
and
smaller
people
as
well
as
things
seemed
and
diminished
in
his
eyes
the
postman
two
women
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
whom
he
met
looked
to
him
like
people
on
a
cinematograph
screen
absolutely
unreal
and
belonging
to
quite
another
world
than
his
after
a
few
minutes
of
this
strange
feeling
he
pulled
himself
up
for
he
was
both
thoughtful
and
quick
to
read
his
own
motives
thus
providing
himself
with
an
inexhaustible
subject
for
surprise
sarcasm
and
pity
come
now
he
said
to
himself
here
is
a
town
in
which
i
have
lived
for
fifteen
years
and
which
suddenly
becomes
strange
to
me
because
i
am
about
to
leave
it
more
than
that
it
has
to
a
certain
extent
already
become
unreal
to
me
now
that
it
is
no
longer
my
own
town
it
ceases
to
exist
and
is
nothing
but
a
vain
image
the
reason
is
that
the
many
interesting
things
it
contains
were
only
interesting
in
so
far
as
they
directly
affected
me
as
soon
as
they
cease
to
do
that
they
practically
do
not
exist
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
thus
this
populous
city
situated
on
the
hills
that
border
a
great
river
this
ancient
gaulish
town
this
colony
where
the
romans
built
temples
and
a
circus
this
strong
city
that
went
through
three
memorable
sieges
where
two
councils
were
held
which
was
enriched
with
a
basilica
the
crypt
of
which
is
still
in
existence
a
cathedral
a
college
sixteen
parish
churches
plus
sixty
chapels
a
town
hall
markets
hospitals
and
palaces
this
town
which
in
very
ancient
times
formed
a
part
of
the
royal
domain
became
the
capital
of
a
vast
province
and
still
bears
on
the
fronton
of
the
governor
s
palace
now
turned
into
barracks
the
civic
coat
of
arms
surrounded
by
lions
and
the
virtues
this
town
which
contains
an
archbishop
s
palace
a
faculty
of
letters
a
faculty
of
science
a
court
of
appeal
and
a
court
of
justice
the
chief
town
of
a
rich
department
only
existed
in
reference
to
myself
it
was
peopled
by
myself
alone
i
was
the
only
cause
of
its
existence
it
is
high
time
for
me
to
go
the
town
is
fading
away
i
never
knew
that
my
mind
was
subjective
to
such
a
mad
extent
a
man
never
knows
himself
and
is
a
monster
without
realizing
thus
did
bergeret
examine
himself
with
praiseworthy
sincerity
as
he
was
passing
the
church
of
however
he
stopped
under
the
porch
of
the
last
judgment
he
had
always
loved
the
old
legendary
sculptures
and
taken
an
interest
in
the
stories
graven
upon
the
stone
one
devil
in
particular
who
had
a
dog
s
head
on
his
shoulders
and
a
man
s
face
on
the
nether
portion
of
his
anatomy
had
a
peculiar
fascination
for
him
he
was
occupied
in
dragging
a
long
file
of
damned
souls
chained
together
and
his
two
countenances
expressed
absolute
contentment
there
was
also
a
little
monk
whom
an
angel
was
trying
to
draw
up
by
his
hands
while
a
devil
dragged
him
down
by
the
feet
bergeret
loved
that
one
but
he
had
never
before
looked
with
so
much
interest
at
these
objects
which
he
was
now
on
the
point
of
leaving
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
away
from
them
the
naïve
idea
of
the
universe
expressed
in
stone
by
men
who
had
been
dead
for
more
than
five
hundred
years
touched
him
and
seemed
to
him
lovable
in
its
absurdity
he
regretted
never
having
studied
it
more
closely
or
examined
it
more
sympathetically
he
remembered
that
this
porch
of
the
last
judgment
which
he
had
seen
gilded
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
whitened
by
the
moonbeams
in
the
joyous
summer
time
and
the
dark
winter
days
would
be
with
him
only
a
little
longer
and
then
he
would
see
it
no
more
he
realized
then
that
he
was
attached
to
things
by
invisible
links
not
to
be
broken
asunder
without
pain
and
his
heart
was
suddenly
filled
with
great
veneration
for
his
town
he
loved
her
old
walls
and
her
old
trees
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
go
up
the
mall
and
look
at
a
favourite
elm
that
grew
there
the
one
he
always
sat
beneath
at
the
close
of
the
long
summer
days
the
beautiful
tree
was
now
bare
of
foliage
and
its
strong
slender
framework
stood
out
naked
and
black
against
the
sky
bergeret
gazed
at
it
long
the
tranquil
giant
was
motionless
and
silent
and
the
mystery
of
its
peaceful
life
gave
rise
to
deep
meditation
on
the
part
of
the
man
who
was
about
to
enter
upon
a
new
phase
of
his
destiny
it
was
thus
bergeret
learned
that
he
loved
his
mother
soil
and
the
town
where
he
had
suffered
tribulation
and
tasted
quiet
happiness
chapter

monseigneur
guitrel
bishop
of
tourcoing
addressed
to
the
president
of
the
republic
the
following
letter
the
text
of
which
was
published
by
the
the
the
the
and
several
other
diocesan
papers
monsieur
le
président
before
bringing
to
your
notice
several
just
causes
for
complaint
and
divers
claims
which
are
only
too
well
founded
allow
me
for
one
short
instant
to
enjoy
the
keen
delight
of
feeling
that
i
am
in
perfect
accord
with
you
on
a
point
which
must
affect
us
both
allow
me
realizing
as
i
do
the
feelings
that
must
have
swayed
you
during
these
long
days
of
trial
and
of
consolation
to
join
with
you
in
an
outburst
of
patriotic
gratitude
oh
how
your
generous
soul
must
have
suffered
when
you
saw
that
handful
of
misguided
men
cast
insult
at
the
army
under
the
pretext
of
defending
justice
and
truth
as
though
justice
and
truth
could
exist
in
opposition
to
social
order
and
the
hierarchy
of
power
established
by
god
himself
upon
this
earth
and
how
that
heart
of
yours
must
have
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
the
whole
nation
without
exception
of
party
rising
as
one
man
to
acclaim
our
brave
army
the
army
of
clovis
charlemagne
and
louis
of
godefroy
de
bouillon
jeanne
d
arc
and
bayard
to
embrace
her
cause
and
avenge
her
wrongs
oh
with
what
satisfaction
must
you
have
witnessed
the
watchful
wisdom
of
the
nation
as
it
frustrated
the
devices
of
the
proud
and
the
certainly
one
can
not
deny
that
the
honour
of
such
praiseworthy
conduct
is
due
to
france
as
a
whole
but
you
are
too
le
président
not
to
have
recognized
the
church
and
her
faithful
members
in
the
van
of
the
supporters
of
law
and
authority
they
were
in
the
front
rank
of
the
battle
saluting
with
confidence
and
respect
the
army
and
her
chiefs
and
was
it
not
the
right
place
for
the
servants
of
him
who
has
called
himself
the
god
of
armies
and
who
to
use
the
words
of
bossuet
has
sanctified
them
in
calling
himself
by
that
name
thus
you
will
always
find
in
us
the
surest
upholders
of
law
and
order
and
the
obedience
which
we
have
not
refused
even
to
princes
that
persecuted
us
will
never
tire
in
return
for
this
may
your
government
ever
look
peacefully
upon
us
and
so
make
our
obedience
a
joy
our
hearts
must
exult
at
sight
of
the
warlike
array
which
makes
us
feared
by
other
nations
and
at
sight
of
you
yourself
in
your
place
of
honour
surrounded
by
your
brilliant
staff
like
king
saul
that
great
and
courageous
man
who
always
attached
the
bravest
warriors
to
his
person

oh
would
that
i
could
end
this
letter
as
i
have
commenced
it
with
words
of
joy
and
gladness
and
how
happy
should
i
be
le
président
if
i
could
associate
your
venerated
name
with
the
declaration
of
peace
in
the
church
as
i
have
associated
it
with
the
victories
gained
before
our
eyes
by
the
spirit
of
authority
over
the
spirit
of
discord
but
alas
it
can
not
be
i
must
bring
to
your
notice
a
subject
of
great
sorrow
must
afflict
your
soul
by
the
spectacle
of
a
great
grief
i
shall
accomplish
an
irresistible
duty
in
bringing
your
mind
to
bear
upon
an
open
and
bleeding
wound
which
must
be
healed
it
is
to
my
interest
to
tell
you
certain
painful
truths
and
to
your
interest
to
listen
my
pastoral
duty
compels
me
to
speak
placed
by
the
grace
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
upon
the
see
of
the
blessed
saint
loup
successor
as
i
am
of
so
many
holy
apostles
and
vigilant
pastors
should
i
be
the
legitimate
heir
of
their
devoted
labours
if
i
had
not
the
courage
to
continue
them
laboraverunt

viii
it
is
therefore
fitting
that
my
feeble
voice
should
uplift
itself
until
it
reach
your
ears
it
is
also
fitting
that
you
lend
an
attentive
ear
to
my
words
for
the
subject
i
am
about
to
discuss
is
worthy
the
thought
of
a
ruler
vero
ea
quæ
digna
sunt
principe
is
but
how
can
i
broach
the
subject
without
immediately
feeling
myself
overcome
by
overwhelming
grief
how
can
i
without
weeping
point
out
to
you
the
state
of
the
religious
whose
spiritual
head
i
am
for
it
is
of
them
i
would
speak
le
président
as
i
entered
my
diocese
how
were
the
sights
that
met
my
gaze
on
all
sides
in
the
sacred
buildings
consecrated
to
the
education
of
children
the
cure
of
the
sick
and
the
care
of
the
aged
the
instruction
of
our
priests
and
the
contemplation
of
the
divine
mysteries
i
found
nothing
but
anxious
faces
and
sad
looks
there
where
the
joy
of
innocence
and
the
quietude
of
labour
formerly
reigned
a
dark
anxiety
has
settled
sighs
go
up
to
heaven
and
from
all
lips
the
same
cry
of
anguish
who
will
care
for
our
sick
and
aged
what
will
become
of
our
little
children
where
shall
we
retire
to
pray
these
were
the
words
that
greeted
the
shepherd
of
the
diocese
of
tourcoing
such
were
the
words
of
the
monks
and
nuns
who
knelt
at
his
feet
and
kissed
his
hands
for
they
have
been
robbed
of
that
which
is
theirs
by
right
of
that
which
is
also
the
right
of
our
poor
our
widows
and
orphans
the
bread
of
our
clergy
and
the
viaticum
of
our
missionaries
thus
at
the
moment
of
total
ruin
our
monks
and
nuns
bewailed
their
fate
while
they
waited
for
the
to
outrage
the
sanctuary
of
our
cloistered
virgins
and
even
to
seize
the
sacred
vessels
on
the
altar
this
then
is
the
state
to
which
our
religious
communities
are
reduced
by
the
enforcement
of
the
different
taxation
laws
to
which
i
have
referred
if
such
mad
and
criminal
enactments
can
be
called
laws
if
you
will
but
examine
the
position
in
which
our
religious
orders
are
placed
by
these
spoliative
measures
dignified
by
the
name
of
laws
the
expressions
of
which
i
make
use
will
not
appear
to
you
excessive
and
a
moment
s
attention
on
your
part
will
make
you
share
my
feelings
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
religious
bodies
are
subject
to
the
general
taxation
it
is
iniquitous
to
force
further
taxes
upon
them
that
will
at
once
strike
you
as
an
injustice
and
i
can
point
out
others
equally
unjust
but
as
regards
this
thing
in
particular
le
président
allow
me
to
protest
both
firmly
and
respectfully
i
have
not
sufficient
authority
to
speak
in
the
name
of
the
entire
church
but
i
am
sure
that
i
do
not
stray
from
the
right
path
when
i
declare
as
an
essential
principle
of
justice
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
impose
burdens
upon
the
church
the
church
pays
what
is
demanded
of
her
she
pays
as
an
act
of
grace
but
she
is
under
no
obligation
to
do
so
her
ancient
exemption
from
taxation
proceeded
from
her
sovereignty
for
the
sovereign
pays
no
tribute
she
can
always
enter
a
claim
to
those
ancient
rights
when
and
where
it
suits
her
convenience
she
can
no
more
renounce
her
just
claims
than
she
can
renounce
her
duties
and
sovereign
privileges
and
as
matters
are
she
gives
proof
of
the
most
admirable
powers
of
renunciation
that
is
all
having
stated
my
objections
i
will
now
proceed
with
my
evidence
the
religious
bodies
are
subject
to
the
following
duties
firstly
general
taxation
as
i
have
just
stated
secondly
taxes
on
inalienable
property
thirdly
a
tax
of
four
per
cent
on
income
acts
of
and
fourthly
liability
under
the
droit
d
accroissement
the
monstrous
effects
of
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
modified
by
what
is
called
the
droit
d
abonnement
by
which
the
government
annually
deducts
from
the
estimated
portion
of
deceased
members
the
sum
of
eleven
francs
per
cent
including
the
decimes
it
is
true
that
by
a
mock
kindness
which
is
in
reality
merely
a
refinement
of
perfidy
and
injustice
the
law
allows
the
charitable
and
educational
institutions
to
be
relieved
of
this
charge
on
account
of
their
utility
as
though
the
houses
where
our
holy
women
pray
god
to
pardon
the
crimes
of
france
and
to
enlighten
her
blinded
rulers
were
not
as
useful
more
useful
even
than
schools
and
hospitals
but
it
was
necessary
to
disunite
the
common
interests
and
in
order
to
do
so
differential
treatment
had
to
be
meted
out
the
idea
was
to
disintegrate
and
paralyse
resistance
this
again
was
the
idea
that
actuated
the
government
when
they
fixed
the
tax
of
per
cent
for
recognized
religious
institutions
and
at
per
cent
for
the
unrecognized
payable
annually
on
the
value
of
property
both
real
and
personal
so
that
the
latter
who
are
not
permitted
to
hold
property
are
judged
liable
to
pay
and
to
pay
even
more
than
the
others
to
sum
up
for
the
further
burden
of
our
religious
bodies
to
the
common
taxes
are
added
the
tax
on
inalienable
property
the
income
tax
of
per
cent
and
the
increment
duties
which
are
not
modified
but
accentuated
by
what
is
called
the
droit
d
abonnement
or
subscription
duty
is
this
endurable
is
it
possible
to
find
in
the
whole
world
another
such
abominable
example
of
spoliation
no
you
must
admit
le
président
that
it
is
not
and
when
the
religious
orders
of
my
diocese
asked
me
what
they
were
to
do
could
i
give
them
any
other
reply
than
the
following
resist
the
law
it
is
your
right
and
duty
to
oppose
injustice
resist
the
law
say
to
them
we
can
not
do
it
they
are
resolved
so
to
do
le
président
and
all
our
religious
bodies
recognized
or
unrecognized
teaching
charitable
or
cloistered
destined
to
foreign
missions
or
to
lives
of
monastic
retreat
are
agreed
in
spite
of
the
inequality
with
which
they
are
assessed
upon
a
stubborn
resistance
they
have
realized
that
the
different
forms
of
treatment
meted
out
to
them
by
your
laws
are
uniformly
iniquitous
and
that
it
behoves
them
to
join
together
in
a
common
defence
their
resolve
is
unshakable
after
having
paved
the
way
to
it
i
support
their
resolution
and
in
so
doing
feel
assured
that
i
am
not
failing
in
the
obedience
i
owe
to
authority
and
to
the
law
and
which
i
render
to
you
both
as
a
matter
of
conscience
and
religion
i
feel
sure
that
i
am
not
misjudging
your
power
which
can
only
be
exercised
for
the
maintenance
of
justice
in
justitia
regnabit
paralip
xxii
in
his
pastoral
letter
his
holiness
leo
xiii
has
expressly
declared
that
the
faithful
may
dispense
with
obedience
to
civil
power
if
the
latter
issue
orders
that
openly
disregard
natural
and
divine
rights
if
a
man
he
has
said
in
this
admirable
letter
finds
himself
forced
to
infringe
either
the
law
of
god
or
the
law
of
man
he
should
follow
the
precepts
of
jesus
christ
and
reply
like
the
apostles
it
is
better
to
obey
god
than
to
act
thus
is
not
to
merit
the
reproach
of
disobedience
for
as
soon
as
the
will
of
a
ruler
is
in
opposition
to
the
will
and
law
of
god
he
exceeds
his
power
justice
is
corrupted
and
henceforth
his
authority
is
impotent
because
in
so
far
as
it
is
unjust
it
ceases
to
believe
me
it
is
not
without
deep
and
protracted
meditation
that
i
have
encouraged
the
religious
bodies
under
my
control
to
make
the
necessary
resistance
i
have
weighed
the
temporal
loss
that
may
perhaps
result
and
such
consideration
has
not
stopped
me
when
we
reply
to
your
you
will
attempt
to
overcome
our
resistance
by
force
but
how
will
you
achieve
your
end
will
you
lay
hands
upon
our
recognized
bodies
dare
you
upon
our
bodies
can
you
will
you
show
a
pitiful
courage
and
sell
our
goods
and
the
objects
dedicated
to
divine
worship
and
if
it
is
indeed
true
that
neither
the
poverty
of
the
former
nor
the
sacred
nature
of
the
latter
will
preserve
them
from
your
rapacity
you
must
learn
and
the
wives
and
children
of
those
who
aid
and
abet
you
must
learn
that
those
who
enter
upon
such
a
course
run
the
risk
of
excommunication
the
terrible
effects
of
which
strike
fear
into
even
the
most
hardened
sinners
and
all
those
who
consent
to
buy
anything
proceeding
from
any
such
unlawful
sale
expose
themselves
to
the
same
penalty
and
if
we
are
robbed
of
our
belongings
hunted
from
our
dwellings
the
injury
will
not
be
to
us
but
to
you
who
will
be
covered
with
the
shame
of
unprecedented
scandal
you
can
retaliate
most
cruelly
upon
us
but
no
threat
can
frighten
us
we
fear
neither
prison
nor
chains
the
manacled
hands
of
priests
and
confessors
have
delivered
the
church
ere
now
come
what
may
we
shall
pay
nothing
we
may
not
we
can
not
before
arriving
