mystery
of
the

hundred
when
i
say
i
am
called
valmont
the
name
will
convey
no
impression
to
the
reader
one
way
or
another
my
occupation
is
that
of
private
detective
in
london
but
if
you
ask
any
policeman
in
paris
who
valmont
was
he
will
likely
be
able
to
tell
you
unless
he
is
a
recent
recruit
if
you
ask
him
where
valmont
is
now
he
may
not
know
yet
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
parisian
police
for
a
period
of
seven
years
i
was
chief
detective
to
the
government
of
france
and
if
i
am
unable
to
prove
myself
a
great
crime
hunter
it
is
because
the
record
of
my
career
is
in
the
secret
archives
of
paris
i
may
admit
at
the
outset
that
i
have
no
grievances
to
air
the
french
government
considered
itself
justified
in
dismissing
me
and
it
did
so
in
this
action
it
was
quite
within
its
right
and
i
should
be
the
last
to
dispute
that
right
but
on
the
other
hand
i
consider
myself
justified
in
publishing
the
following
account
of
what
actually
occurred
especially
as
so
many
false
rumours
have
been
put
abroad
concerning
the
case
however
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
i
hold
no
grievance
because
my
worldly
affairs
are
now
much
more
prosperous
than
they
were
in
paris
my
intimate
knowledge
of
that
city
and
the
country
of
which
it
is
the
capital
bringing
to
me
many
cases
with
which
i
have
dealt
more
or
less
successfully
since
i
established
myself
in
london
without
further
preliminary
i
shall
at
once
plunge
into
an
account
of
the
case
which
riveted
the
attention
of
the
whole
world
a
little
more
than
a
decade
ago
the
year
was
a
prosperous
twelve
months
for
france
the
weather
was
good
the
harvest
excellent
and
the
wine
of
that
vintage
is
celebrated
to
this
day
everyone
was
well
off
and
reasonably
happy
a
marked
contrast
to
the
state
of
things
a
few
years
later
when
dissension
over
the
dreyfus
case
rent
the
country
in
twain
newspaper
readers
may
remember
that
in
the
government
of
france
fell
heir
to
an
unexpected
treasure
which
set
the
civilised
world
agog
especially
those
inhabitants
of
it
who
are
interested
in
historical
relics
this
was
the
finding
of
the
diamond
necklace
in
the
château
de
chaumont
where
it
had
rested
undiscovered
for
a
century
in
a
rubbish
heap
of
an
attic
i
believe
it
has
not
been
questioned
that
this
was
the
veritable
necklace
which
the
court
jeweller
boehmer
hoped
to
sell
to
marie
antoinette
although
how
it
came
to
be
in
the
château
de
chaumont
no
one
has
been
able
to
form
even
a
conjecture
for
a
hundred
years
it
was
supposed
that
the
necklace
had
been
broken
up
in
london
and
its
half
a
thousand
stones
great
and
small
sold
separately
it
has
always
seemed
strange
to
me
that
the
countess
de
who
was
thought
to
have
profited
by
the
sale
of
these
jewels
should
not
have
abandoned
france
if
she
possessed
money
to
leave
that
country
for
exposure
was
inevitable
if
she
remained
indeed
the
unfortunate
woman
was
branded
and
imprisoned
and
afterwards
was
dashed
to
death
from
the
third
storey
of
a
london
house
when
in
the
direst
poverty
she
sought
escape
from
the
consequences
of
the
debts
she
had
incurred
i
am
not
superstitious
in
the
least
yet
this
celebrated
piece
of
seems
actually
to
have
exerted
a
malign
influence
over
everyone
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
connected
with
it
indeed
in
a
small
way
i
who
write
these
words
suffered
dismissal
and
disgrace
though
i
caught
but
one
glimpse
of
this
dazzling
scintillation
of
jewels
the
jeweller
who
made
the
necklace
met
financial
ruin
the
queen
for
whom
it
was
constructed
was
beheaded
that
prince
louis
rené
edouard
cardinal
de
rohan
who
purchased
it
was
flung
into
prison
the
unfortunate
countess
who
said
she
acted
as
until
the
transfer
was
concluded
clung
for
five
awful
minutes
to
a
london
before
dropping
to
her
death
to
the
flags
below
and
now
a
hundred
and
eight
years
later
up
comes
this
devil
display
of
fireworks
to
the
light
again
droulliard
the
working
man
who
found
the
ancient
box
seems
to
have
prised
it
open
and
ignorant
though
he
was
he
had
probably
never
seen
a
diamond
in
his
life
before
realised
that
a
fortune
was
in
his
grasp
the
baleful
glitter
from
the
combination
must
have
sent
madness
into
his
brain
working
havoc
therein
as
though
the
shafts
of
brightness
were
those
mysterious
rays
which
scientists
have
recently
discovered
he
might
quite
easily
have
walked
through
the
main
gate
of
the
château
unsuspected
and
unquestioned
with
the
diamonds
concealed
about
his
person
but
instead
of
this
he
crept
from
the
attic
window
on
to
the
steep
roof
slipped
to
the
eaves
fell
to
the
ground
and
lay
dead
with
a
broken
neck
while
the
necklace
intact
shimmered
in
the
sunlight
beside
his
body
no
matter
where
these
jewels
had
been
found
the
government
would
have
insisted
that
they
belonged
to
the
treasury
of
the
republic
but
as
the
château
de
chaumont
was
a
historical
monument
and
the
property
of
france
there
could
be
no
question
regarding
the
ownership
of
the
necklace
the
government
at
once
claimed
it
and
ordered
it
to
be
sent
by
a
trustworthy
military
man
to
paris
it
was
carried
safely
and
delivered
promptly
to
the
authorities
by
alfred
dreyfus
a
young
captain
of
artillery
to
whom
its
custody
had
been
entrusted
in
spite
of
its
fall
from
the
tall
tower
neither
case
nor
jewels
were
perceptibly
damaged
the
lock
of
the
box
had
apparently
been
forced
by
droulliard
hatchet
or
perhaps
by
the
clasp
knife
found
on
his
body
on
reaching
the
ground
the
lid
had
flown
open
and
the
necklace
was
thrown
out
i
believe
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
cabinet
regarding
the
fate
of
this
trophy
one
section
wishing
it
to
be
placed
in
a
museum
on
account
of
its
historical
interest
another
advocating
the
breaking
up
of
the
necklace
and
the
selling
of
the
diamonds
for
what
they
would
fetch
but
a
third
party
maintained
that
the
method
to
get
the
most
money
into
the
coffers
of
the
country
was
to
sell
the
necklace
as
it
stood
for
as
the
world
now
contains
so
many
rich
amateurs
who
collect
undoubted
rarities
regardless
of
expense
the
historic
associations
of
the
jewelled
collar
would
enhance
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
stones
and
this
view
prevailing
it
was
announced
that
the
necklace
would
be
sold
by
auction
a
month
later
in
the
rooms
of
meyer
renault
and
in
the
boulevard
des
italians
near
the
bank
of
the
this
announcement
elicited
much
comment
from
the
newspapers
of
all
countries
and
it
seemed
that
from
a
financial
point
of
view
at
least
the
decision
of
the
government
had
been
wise
for
it
speedily
became
evident
that
a
notable
coterie
of
wealthy
buyers
would
be
congregated
in
paris
on
the
thirteenth
unlucky
day
for
me
when
the
sale
was
to
take
place
but
we
of
the
inner
circle
were
made
aware
of
another
result
somewhat
more
disquieting
which
was
that
the
most
expert
criminals
in
the
world
were
also
gathering
like
vultures
upon
the
fair
city
the
honour
of
france
was
at
stake
whoever
bought
that
necklace
must
be
assured
of
a
safe
conduct
out
of
the
country
we
might
view
with
equanimity
whatever
happened
afterwards
but
while
he
was
a
resident
of
france
his
life
and
property
must
not
be
endangered
thus
it
came
about
that
i
was
given
full
authority
to
ensure
that
neither
murder
nor
theft
nor
both
combined
should
be
committed
while
the
purchaser
of
the
necklace
remained
within
our
boundaries
and
for
this
purpose
the
police
resources
of
france
were
placed
unreservedly
at
my
disposal
if
i
failed
there
should
be
no
one
to
blame
but
myself
consequently
as
i
have
remarked
before
i
do
not
complain
of
my
dismissal
by
the
government
the
broken
lock
of
the
had
been
very
deftly
repaired
by
an
expert
locksmith
who
in
executing
his
task
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
scratch
a
finger
on
the
broken
metal
whereupon
blood
poisoning
set
in
and
although
his
life
was
saved
he
was
dismissed
from
the
hospital
with
his
right
arm
gone
and
his
usefulness
destroyed
when
the
jeweller
boehmer
made
the
necklace
he
asked
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
pounds
for
it
but
after
years
of
disappointment
he
was
content
to
sell
it
to
cardinal
de
rohan
for
thousand
pounds
to
be
liquidated
in
three
instalments
not
one
of
which
was
ever
paid
this
latter
amount
was
probably
somewhere
near
the
value
of
the
five
hundred
and
sixteen
separate
stones
one
of
which
was
of
tremendous
size
a
very
monarch
of
diamonds
holding
its
court
among
seventeen
brilliants
each
as
large
as
a
filbert
this
iridescent
concentration
of
wealth
was
as
one
might
say
placed
in
my
care
and
i
had
to
see
to
it
that
no
harm
came
to
the
necklace
or
to
its
prospective
owner
until
they
were
safely
across
the
boundaries
of
france
the
four
weeks
previous
to
the
thirteenth
proved
a
busy
and
anxious
time
for
me
thousands
most
of
whom
were
actuated
by
mere
curiosity
wished
to
view
the
diamonds
we
were
compelled
to
discriminate
and
sometimes
discriminated
against
the
wrong
person
which
caused
unpleasantness
three
distinct
attempts
were
made
to
rob
the
safe
but
luckily
these
criminal
efforts
were
frustrated
and
so
we
came
unscathed
to
the
eventful
thirteenth
of
the
month
the
sale
was
to
begin
at
two
and
on
the
morning
of
that
day
i
took
the
somewhat
tyrannical
precaution
of
having
the
more
dangerous
of
our
own
malefactors
and
as
many
of
the
foreign
thieves
as
i
could
trump
up
charges
against
laid
by
the
heels
yet
i
knew
very
well
it
was
not
these
rascals
i
had
most
to
fear
but
the
suave
gentlemen
amply
supplied
with
unimpeachable
credentials
stopping
at
our
fine
hotels
and
living
like
princes
many
of
these
were
foreigners
against
whom
we
could
prove
nothing
and
whose
arrest
might
land
us
into
temporary
international
difficulties
nevertheless
i
had
each
of
them
shadowed
and
on
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
if
one
of
them
had
even
disputed
a
cab
fare
i
should
have
had
him
in
prison
half
an
hour
later
and
taken
the
consequences
but
these
gentlemen
are
very
shrewd
and
do
not
commit
mistakes
i
made
up
a
list
of
all
the
men
in
the
world
who
were
able
or
likely
to
purchase
the
necklace
many
of
them
would
not
be
present
in
person
at
the
auction
rooms
their
bidding
would
be
done
by
agents
this
simplified
matters
a
good
deal
for
the
agents
kept
me
duly
informed
of
their
purposes
and
besides
an
agent
who
handles
treasure
every
week
is
an
adept
at
the
business
and
does
not
need
the
protection
which
must
surround
an
amateur
who
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
has
but
scant
idea
of
the
dangers
that
threaten
him
beyond
knowing
that
if
he
goes
down
a
dark
street
in
a
dangerous
quarter
he
is
likely
to
be
maltreated
and
robbed
there
were
no
less
than
sixteen
clients
all
told
whom
we
learned
were
to
attend
personally
on
the
day
of
the
sale
any
one
of
whom
might
well
have
made
the
purchase
the
marquis
of
warlingham
and
lord
oxtead
from
england
were
jewel
fanciers
while
at
least
half
a
dozen
millionaires
were
expected
from
the
united
states
with
a
smattering
from
germany
austria
and
russia
and
one
each
from
italy
belgium
and
holland
admission
to
the
auction
rooms
was
allowed
by
ticket
only
to
be
applied
for
at
least
a
week
in
advance
applications
to
be
accompanied
by
satisfactory
testimonials
it
would
possibly
have
surprised
many
of
the
rich
men
collected
there
to
know
that
they
sat
cheek
by
jowl
with
some
of
the
most
noted
thieves
of
england
and
america
but
i
allowed
this
for
two
reasons
first
i
wished
to
keep
these
sharpers
under
my
own
eye
until
i
knew
who
had
bought
the
necklace
and
secondly
i
was
desirous
that
they
should
not
know
they
were
suspected
i
stationed
trusty
men
outside
on
the
boulevard
des
italians
each
of
whom
knew
by
sight
most
of
the
probable
purchasers
of
the
necklace
it
was
arranged
that
when
the
sale
was
over
i
should
walk
out
to
the
boulevard
alongside
the
man
who
was
the
new
owner
of
the
diamonds
and
from
that
moment
until
he
quitted
france
my
men
were
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
if
he
took
personal
custody
of
the
stones
instead
of
doing
the
sensible
and
proper
thing
of
having
them
insured
and
forwarded
to
his
residence
by
some
responsible
transit
company
or
depositing
them
in
the
bank
in
fact
i
took
every
precaution
that
occurred
to
me
all
police
paris
was
on
the
and
felt
itself
pitted
against
the
scoundrelism
of
the
world
for
one
reason
or
another
it
was
nearly
two
before
the
sale
began
there
had
been
considerable
delay
because
of
forged
tickets
and
indeed
each
order
for
admittance
was
so
closely
scrutinised
that
this
in
itself
took
a
good
deal
more
time
than
we
anticipated
every
chair
was
occupied
and
still
a
number
of
the
visitors
were
compelled
to
stand
i
stationed
myself
by
the
swinging
doors
at
the
entrance
end
of
the
hall
where
i
could
command
a
view
of
the
entire
assemblage
some
of
my
men
were
placed
with
backs
against
the
wall
whilst
others
were
distributed
amongst
the
chairs
all
in
plain
clothes
during
the
sale
the
diamonds
themselves
were
not
displayed
but
the
box
containing
them
rested
in
front
of
the
auctioneer
and
three
policemen
in
uniform
stood
guard
on
either
side
very
quietly
the
auctioneer
began
by
saying
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
expatiate
on
the
notable
character
of
the
treasure
he
was
privileged
to
offer
for
sale
and
with
this
preliminary
he
requested
those
present
to
bid
someone
offered
twenty
thousand
francs
which
was
received
with
much
laughter
then
the
bidding
went
steadily
on
until
it
reached
nine
hundred
thousand
francs
which
i
knew
to
be
less
than
half
the
reserve
the
government
had
placed
upon
the
necklace
the
contest
advanced
more
slowly
until
the
million
and
a
half
was
touched
and
there
it
hung
fire
for
a
time
while
the
auctioneer
remarked
that
this
sum
did
not
equal
that
which
the
maker
of
the
necklace
had
been
finally
forced
to
accept
for
it
after
another
pause
he
added
that
as
the
reserve
was
not
exceeded
the
necklace
would
be
withdrawn
and
probably
never
again
offered
for
sale
he
therefore
urged
those
who
were
holding
back
to
make
their
bids
now
at
this
the
contest
livened
until
the
sum
of
two
million
three
hundred
thousand
francs
had
been
offered
and
now
i
knew
the
necklace
would
be
sold
nearing
the
three
million
mark
the
competition
thinned
down
to
a
few
dealers
from
hamburg
and
the
marquis
of
warlingham
from
england
when
a
voice
that
had
not
yet
been
heard
in
the
auction
room
was
lifted
in
a
tone
of
some
impatience
million
dollars
there
was
an
instant
hush
followed
by
the
scribbling
of
pencils
as
each
person
present
reduced
the
sum
to
its
equivalent
in
his
own
currency
pounds
for
the
english
francs
for
the
french
marks
for
the
german
and
so
on
the
aggressive
tone
and
the
face
of
the
bidder
proclaimed
him
an
american
not
less
than
the
financial
denomination
he
had
used
in
a
moment
it
was
realised
that
his
bid
was
a
clear
leap
of
more
than
two
million
francs
and
a
sigh
went
up
from
the
audience
as
if
this
settled
it
and
the
great
sale
was
done
nevertheless
the
auctioneer
hammer
hovered
over
the
lid
of
his
desk
and
he
looked
up
and
down
the
long
line
of
faces
turned
towards
him
he
seemed
reluctant
to
tap
the
board
but
no
one
ventured
to
compete
against
this
tremendous
sum
and
with
a
sharp
click
the
mallet
fell
name
he
asked
bending
over
towards
the
customer
replied
the
american
a
cheque
for
the
amount
take
the
diamonds
with
me
request
is
somewhat
unusual
protested
the
auctioneer
mildly
know
what
you
mean
interrupted
the
american
think
the
cheque
may
not
be
cashed
you
will
notice
it
is
drawn
on
the
which
is
practically
next
door
i
must
have
the
jewels
with
me
send
round
your
messenger
with
the
cheque
it
will
take
only
a
few
minutes
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
money
is
there
to
meet
it
the
necklace
is
mine
and
i
insist
on
having
it
the
auctioneer
with
some
demur
handed
the
cheque
to
the
representative
of
the
french
government
who
was
present
and
this
official
himself
went
to
the
bank
there
were
some
other
things
to
be
sold
and
the
auctioneer
endeavoured
to
go
on
through
the
list
but
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
him
meanwhile
i
was
studying
the
countenance
of
the
man
who
had
made
the
astounding
bid
when
i
should
instead
have
adjusted
my
preparations
to
meet
the
new
conditions
now
confronting
me
here
was
a
man
about
whom
we
knew
nothing
whatever
i
had
come
to
the
instant
conclusion
that
he
was
a
prince
of
criminals
and
that
a
sinister
design
not
at
that
moment
fathomed
by
me
was
on
foot
to
get
possession
of
the
jewels
the
handing
up
of
the
cheque
was
clearly
a
trick
of
some
sort
and
i
fully
expected
the
official
to
return
and
say
the
draft
was
good
i
determined
to
prevent
this
man
from
getting
the
jewel
box
until
i
knew
more
of
his
game
quickly
i
removed
from
my
place
near
the
door
to
the
auctioneer
desk
having
two
objects
in
view
first
to
warn
the
auctioneer
not
to
part
with
the
treasure
too
easily
and
second
to
study
the
suspected
man
at
closer
range
of
all
the
american
is
most
to
be
feared
he
uses
more
ingenuity
in
the
planning
of
his
projects
and
will
take
greater
risks
in
carrying
them
out
than
any
other
malefactor
on
earth
from
my
new
station
i
saw
there
were
two
men
to
deal
with
the
bidder
face
was
keen
and
intellectual
his
hands
refined
clean
and
white
showing
they
were
long
divorced
from
manual
labour
if
indeed
they
had
ever
done
any
useful
work
coolness
and
imperturbability
were
his
beyond
a
doubt
the
companion
who
sat
at
his
right
was
of
an
entirely
different
stamp
his
hands
were
hairy
and
his
face
bore
the
stamp
of
grim
determination
and
unflinching
bravery
i
knew
that
these
two
types
usually
hunted
in
couples
the
one
to
scheme
the
other
to
execute
and
they
always
formed
a
combination
dangerous
to
encounter
and
difficult
to
circumvent
there
was
a
buzz
of
conversation
up
and
down
the
hall
as
these
two
men
talked
together
in
low
tones
i
knew
now
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
the
most
hazardous
problem
of
my
life
i
whispered
to
the
auctioneer
who
bent
his
head
to
listen
he
knew
very
well
who
i
was
of
course
must
not
give
up
the
necklace
i
began
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
am
under
the
orders
of
the
official
from
the
ministry
of
the
interior
you
must
speak
to
him
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
i
replied
do
not
give
up
the
box
too
readily
am
helpless
he
protested
with
another
shrug
obey
the
orders
of
the
government
seeing
it
was
useless
to
parley
further
with
the
auctioneer
i
set
my
wits
to
work
to
meet
the
new
emergency
i
felt
convinced
that
the
cheque
would
prove
to
be
genuine
and
that
the
fraud
wherever
it
lay
might
not
be
disclosed
in
time
to
aid
the
authorities
my
duty
therefore
was
to
make
sure
we
lost
sight
neither
of
the
buyer
nor
the
thing
bought
of
course
i
could
not
arrest
the
purchaser
merely
on
suspicion
besides
it
would
make
the
government
the
of
the
world
if
they
sold
a
case
of
jewels
and
immediately
placed
the
buyer
in
custody
when
they
themselves
had
handed
over
his
goods
to
him
ridicule
kills
in
france
a
breath
of
laughter
may
blow
a
government
out
of
existence
in
paris
much
more
effectually
than
will
a
whiff
of
cannon
smoke
my
duty
then
was
to
give
the
government
full
warning
and
never
lose
sight
of
my
man
until
he
was
clear
of
france
then
my
responsibility
ended
i
took
aside
one
of
my
own
men
in
plain
clothes
and
said
to
him
have
seen
the
american
who
has
bought
the
necklace
sir
well
go
outside
quietly
and
station
yourself
there
he
is
likely
to
emerge
presently
with
the
jewels
in
his
possession
you
are
not
to
lose
sight
of
either
the
man
or
the
casket
i
shall
follow
him
and
be
close
behind
him
as
he
emerges
and
you
are
to
shadow
us
if
he
parts
with
the
case
you
must
be
ready
at
a
sign
from
me
to
follow
either
the
man
or
the
jewels
do
you
understand
sir
he
answered
and
left
the
room
it
is
ever
the
unforeseen
that
baffles
us
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
i
should
have
sent
two
men
and
i
have
often
thought
since
how
admirable
is
the
regulation
of
the
italian
government
which
sends
out
its
policemen
in
pairs
or
i
should
have
given
my
man
power
to
call
for
help
but
even
as
it
was
he
did
only
half
as
well
as
i
had
a
right
to
expect
of
him
and
the
blunder
he
committed
by
a
hesitation
ah
well
there
is
no
use
of
scolding
after
all
the
result
might
have
been
the
same
just
as
my
man
disappeared
between
the
two
folding
doors
the
official
from
the
ministry
of
the
interior
entered
i
intercepted
him
about
on
his
journey
from
the
door
to
the
auctioneer
the
cheque
appears
to
be
genuine
i
whispered
to
him
certainly
he
replied
pompously
he
was
an
individual
greatly
impressed
with
his
own
importance
a
kind
of
character
with
which
it
is
always
difficult
to
deal
afterwards
the
government
asserted
that
this
official
had
warned
me
and
the
utterances
of
an
ass
dressed
in
a
little
brief
authority
as
the
english
poet
says
were
looked
upon
as
the
epitome
of
wisdom
advise
you
strongly
not
to
hand
over
the
necklace
as
has
been
requested
i
went
on
he
asked
i
am
convinced
the
bidder
is
a
criminal
you
have
proof
of
that
arrest
him
have
no
proof
at
the
present
moment
but
i
request
you
to
delay
the
delivery
of
the
goods
is
absurd
he
cried
impatiently
necklace
is
his
not
ours
the
money
has
already
been
transferred
to
the
account
of
the
government
we
can
not
retain
the
five
million
francs
and
refuse
to
hand
over
to
him
what
he
has
bought
with
them
and
so
the
man
left
me
standing
there
nonplussed
and
anxious
the
eyes
of
everyone
in
the
room
had
been
turned
on
us
during
our
brief
conversation
and
now
the
official
proceeded
ostentatiously
up
the
room
with
a
grand
air
of
importance
then
with
a
bow
and
a
flourish
of
the
hand
he
said
dramatically
jewels
belong
to
monsieur
the
two
americans
rose
simultaneously
the
taller
holding
out
his
hand
while
the
auctioneer
passed
to
him
the
case
he
had
apparently
paid
so
highly
for
the
american
nonchalantly
opened
the
box
and
for
the
first
time
the
electric
radiance
of
the
jewels
burst
upon
that
audience
each
member
of
which
craned
his
neck
to
behold
it
it
seemed
to
me
a
most
reckless
thing
to
do
he
examined
the
jewels
minutely
for
a
few
moments
then
snapped
the
lid
shut
again
and
calmly
put
the
box
in
his
outside
pocket
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
light
overcoat
he
wore
possessed
pockets
made
extraordinarily
large
as
if
on
purpose
for
this
very
case
and
now
this
amazing
man
walked
serenely
down
the
room
past
miscreants
who
joyfully
would
have
cut
his
throat
for
even
the
smallest
diamond
in
that
conglomeration
yet
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
put
his
hand
on
the
pocket
which
contained
the
case
or
in
any
way
attempt
to
protect
it
the
assemblage
seemed
stricken
dumb
by
his
audacity
his
friend
followed
closely
at
his
heels
and
the
tall
man
disappeared
through
the
folding
doors
not
so
the
other
he
turned
quickly
and
whipped
two
revolvers
out
of
his
pockets
which
he
presented
at
the
astonished
crowd
there
had
been
a
movement
on
the
part
of
every
one
to
leave
the
room
but
the
sight
of
these
deadly
weapons
confronting
them
made
each
one
shrink
into
his
place
again
the
man
with
his
back
to
the
door
spoke
in
a
loud
and
domineering
voice
asking
the
auctioneer
to
translate
what
he
had
to
say
into
french
and
german
he
spoke
in
english
here
shiners
are
valuable
they
belong
to
my
friend
who
has
just
gone
out
casting
no
reflections
on
the
generality
of
people
in
this
room
there
are
nevertheless
half
a
dozen
crooks
among
us
whom
my
friend
wishes
to
avoid
now
no
honest
man
here
will
object
to
giving
the
buyer
of
that
there
trinket
five
clear
minutes
in
which
to
get
away
it
only
the
crooks
that
can
kick
i
ask
these
five
minutes
as
a
favour
but
if
they
are
not
granted
i
am
going
to
take
them
as
a
right
any
man
who
moves
will
get
shot
am
an
honest
man
i
cried
i
object
i
am
chief
detective
of
the
french
government
stand
aside
the
police
will
protect
your
friend
on
my
son
warned
the
american
turning
one
weapon
directly
upon
me
while
the
other
held
a
sort
of
roving
commission
pointing
all
over
the
room
friend
is
from
new
york
and
he
distrusts
the
police
as
much
as
he
does
the
grafters
you
may
be
twenty
detectives
but
if
you
move
before
that
clock
strikes
three
i
bring
you
down
and
do
you
forget
it
it
is
one
thing
to
face
death
in
a
fierce
struggle
but
quite
another
to
advance
coldly
upon
it
toward
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
held
so
steadily
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
escape
the
gleam
of
determination
in
the
man
eyes
convinced
me
he
meant
what
he
said
i
did
not
consider
then
nor
have
i
considered
since
that
the
next
five
minutes
precious
as
they
were
would
be
worth
paying
my
life
for
apparently
everyone
else
was
of
my
opinion
for
none
moved
hand
or
foot
until
the
clock
slowly
struck
three
you
gentlemen
said
the
american
as
he
vanished
between
the
when
i
say
vanished
i
mean
that
word
and
no
other
because
my
men
outside
saw
nothing
of
this
individual
then
or
later
he
vanished
as
if
he
had
never
existed
and
it
was
some
hours
before
we
found
how
this
had
been
accomplished
i
rushed
out
almost
on
his
heels
as
one
might
say
and
hurriedly
questioned
my
waiting
men
they
had
all
seen
the
tall
american
come
out
with
the
greatest
leisure
and
stroll
towards
the
west
as
he
was
not
the
man
any
of
them
were
looking
for
they
paid
no
further
attention
to
him
as
indeed
is
the
custom
with
our
parisian
force
they
have
eyes
for
nothing
but
what
they
are
sent
to
look
for
and
this
trait
has
its
drawbacks
for
their
superiors
i
ran
up
the
boulevard
my
whole
thought
intent
on
the
diamonds
and
their
owner
i
knew
my
subordinate
in
command
of
the
men
inside
the
hall
would
look
after
the
scoundrel
with
the
pistols
a
short
distance
up
i
found
the
stupid
fellow
i
had
sent
out
standing
in
a
dazed
manner
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
michodière
gazing
alternately
down
that
short
street
and
towards
the
place
de
the
very
fact
that
he
was
there
furnished
proof
that
he
had
failed
is
the
american
i
demanded
went
down
this
street
sir
why
are
you
standing
here
like
a
fool
followed
him
this
far
when
a
man
came
up
the
rue
michodière
and
without
a
word
the
american
handed
him
the
turning
instantly
down
the
street
up
which
the
other
had
come
the
other
jumped
into
a
cab
and
drove
towards
the
place
de
what
did
you
do
stood
here
like
a
post
i
suppose
did
know
what
to
do
sir
it
all
happened
in
a
moment
did
you
follow
the
cab
did
know
which
to
follow
sir
and
the
cab
was
gone
instantly
while
i
watched
the
american
was
its
number
do
know
sir
clod
why
did
you
call
one
of
our
men
whoever
was
nearest
and
leave
him
to
shadow
the
american
while
you
followed
the
cab
did
shout
to
the
nearest
man
sir
but
he
said
you
told
him
to
stay
there
and
watch
the
english
lord
and
even
before
he
had
spoken
both
american
and
cabman
were
out
of
sight
the
man
to
whom
he
gave
the
box
an
american
also
sir
he
was
french
do
you
know
his
appearance
and
the
words
he
spoke
thought
you
said
he
did
speak
did
not
speak
to
the
american
sir
but
he
said
to
the
cabman
drive
to
the
madeleine
as
quickly
as
you
can
the
man
was
a
head
shorter
than
the
american
wore
a
black
beard
and
moustache
rather
neatly
trimmed
and
seemed
to
be
a
superior
sort
of
artisan
did
not
take
the
number
of
the
cab
should
you
know
the
cabman
if
you
saw
him
again
sir
i
think
so
taking
this
fellow
with
me
i
returned
to
the
now
nearly
empty
auction
room
and
there
gathered
all
my
men
about
me
each
in
his
notebook
took
down
particulars
of
the
cabman
and
his
passenger
from
the
lips
of
my
incompetent
spy
next
i
dictated
a
full
description
of
the
two
americans
then
scattered
my
men
to
the
various
railway
stations
of
the
lines
leading
out
of
paris
with
orders
to
make
inquiries
of
the
police
on
duty
there
and
to
arrest
one
or
more
of
the
four
persons
described
should
they
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
any
of
them
i
now
learned
how
the
rogue
with
the
pistols
vanished
so
completely
as
he
did
my
subordinate
in
the
auction
room
had
speedily
solved
the
mystery
to
the
left
of
the
main
entrance
of
the
auction
room
was
a
door
that
gave
private
access
to
the
rear
of
the
premises
as
the
attendant
in
charge
confessed
when
questioned
he
had
been
bribed
by
the
american
earlier
in
the
day
to
leave
this
side
door
open
and
to
allow
the
man
to
escape
by
the
goods
entrance
thus
the
ruffian
did
not
appear
on
the
boulevard
at
all
and
so
had
not
been
observed
by
any
of
my
men
taking
my
futile
spy
with
me
i
returned
to
my
own
office
and
sent
an
order
throughout
the
city
that
every
cabman
who
had
been
in
the
boulevard
des
italiens
between
two
and
three
that
afternoon
should
report
immediately
to
me
the
examination
of
these
men
proved
a
very
tedious
business
indeed
but
whatever
other
countries
may
say
of
us
we
french
are
patient
and
if
the
haystack
is
searched
long
enough
the
needle
will
be
found
i
did
not
discover
the
needle
i
was
looking
for
but
i
came
upon
one
quite
as
important
if
not
more
so
it
was
nearly
ten
at
night
when
a
cabman
answered
my
questions
in
the
affirmative
you
take
up
a
passenger
a
few
minutes
past
three
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
near
the
had
he
a
short
black
beard
did
he
carry
a
small
box
in
his
hand
and
order
you
to
drive
to
the
madeleine
the
cabman
seemed
puzzled
wore
a
short
black
beard
when
he
got
out
of
the
cab
he
replied
do
you
mean
by
that
drive
a
closed
cab
sir
when
he
got
in
he
was
a
gentleman
when
he
got
out
he
wore
a
short
black
beard
he
a
frenchman
sir
he
was
a
foreigner
either
english
or
american
he
carrying
a
box
sir
he
held
in
his
hand
a
small
leather
bag
did
he
tell
you
to
drive
told
me
to
follow
the
cab
in
front
which
had
just
driven
off
very
rapidly
towards
the
madeleine
in
fact
i
heard
the
man
such
as
you
describe
order
the
other
cabman
to
drive
to
the
madeleine
i
had
come
alongside
the
curb
when
this
man
held
up
his
hand
for
a
cab
but
the
open
cab
cut
in
ahead
of
me
just
then
my
passenger
stepped
up
and
said
in
french
but
with
a
foreign
accent
follow
that
cab
wherever
it
goes
i
turned
with
some
indignation
to
my
inefficient
spy
told
me
i
said
the
american
had
gone
down
a
side
street
yet
he
evidently
met
a
second
man
obtained
from
him
the
handbag
turned
back
and
got
into
the
closed
cab
directly
behind
you
sir
stammered
the
spy
could
not
look
in
two
directions
at
the
same
time
the
american
certainly
went
down
the
side
street
but
of
course
i
watched
the
cab
which
contained
the
jewels
you
saw
nothing
of
the
closed
cab
right
at
your
elbow
boulevard
was
full
of
cabs
sir
and
the
pavement
crowded
with
as
it
always
is
at
that
hour
of
the
day
and
i
have
only
two
eyes
in
my
head
am
glad
to
know
you
had
that
many
for
i
was
beginning
to
think
you
were
blind
although
i
said
this
i
knew
in
my
heart
it
was
useless
to
censure
the
poor
wretch
for
the
fault
was
entirely
my
own
in
not
sending
two
men
and
in
failing
to
guess
the
possibility
of
the
jewels
and
their
owner
being
separated
besides
here
was
a
clue
to
my
hand
at
last
and
no
time
must
be
lost
in
following
it
up
so
i
continued
my
interrogation
of
the
cabman
other
cab
was
an
open
vehicle
you
say
sir
succeeded
in
following
it
yes
sir
at
the
madeleine
the
man
in
front
redirected
the
coachman
who
turned
to
the
left
and
drove
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
then
up
the
to
the
arch
and
so
down
the
avenue
de
la
grande
armée
and
the
avenue
de
neuilly
to
the
pont
de
neuilly
where
it
came
to
a
standstill
my
fare
got
out
and
i
saw
he
now
wore
a
short
black
beard
which
he
had
evidently
put
on
inside
the
cab
he
gave
me
a
piece
which
was
very
satisfactory
the
fare
you
were
following
what
did
he
do
also
stepped
out
paid
the
cabman
went
down
the
bank
of
the
river
and
got
on
board
a
steam
launch
that
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
he
look
behind
or
appear
to
know
that
he
was
being
followed
sir
your
fare
ran
after
the
first
man
and
also
went
aboard
the
steam
launch
which
instantly
started
down
the
river
that
was
the
last
you
saw
of
them
sir
what
time
did
you
reach
the
pont
de
neuilly
do
not
know
sir
i
was
compelled
to
drive
rather
fast
but
the
distance
is
seven
to
eight
kilometres
would
do
it
under
the
hour
certainly
under
the
hour
you
must
have
reached
neuilly
bridge
about
four
is
very
likely
sir
the
plan
of
the
tall
american
was
now
perfectly
clear
to
me
and
it
comprised
nothing
that
was
contrary
to
law
he
had
evidently
placed
his
luggage
on
board
the
steam
launch
in
the
morning
the
handbag
had
contained
various
materials
which
would
enable
him
to
disguise
himself
and
this
bag
he
had
probably
left
in
some
shop
down
the
side
street
or
else
someone
was
waiting
with
it
for
him
the
giving
of
the
treasure
to
another
man
was
not
so
risky
as
it
had
at
first
appeared
because
he
instantly
followed
that
man
who
was
probably
his
confidential
servant
despite
the
windings
of
the
river
there
was
ample
time
for
the
launch
to
reach
havre
before
the
american
steamer
sailed
on
saturday
morning
i
surmised
it
was
his
intention
to
come
alongside
the
steamer
before
she
left
her
berth
in
havre
harbour
and
thus
transfer
himself
and
his
belongings
unperceived
by
anyone
on
watch
at
the
land
side
of
the
liner
all
this
of
course
was
perfectly
justifiable
and
seemed
in
truth
merely
a
scheme
for
escaping
observation
his
only
danger
of
being
tracked
was
when
he
got
into
the
cab
once
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
boulevard
des
italiens
he
was
reasonably
sure
to
evade
pursuit
and
the
five
minutes
which
his
friend
with
the
pistols
had
won
for
him
afforded
just
the
time
he
needed
to
get
so
far
as
the
place
madeleine
and
after
that
everything
was
easy
yet
if
it
had
not
been
for
those
five
minutes
secured
by
coercion
i
should
not
have
found
the
slightest
excuse
for
arresting
him
but
he
was
accessory
after
the
act
in
that
piece
of
illegality
in
fact
it
was
absolutely
certain
that
he
had
been
accessory
before
the
act
and
guilty
of
conspiracy
with
the
man
who
had
presented
firearms
to
the
audience
and
who
had
interfered
with
an
officer
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
by
threatening
me
and
my
men
so
i
was
now
legally
in
the
right
if
i
arrested
every
person
on
board
that
steam
launch
with
a
map
of
the
river
before
me
i
proceeded
to
make
some
calculations
it
was
now
nearly
ten
at
night
the
launch
had
had
six
hours
in
which
to
travel
at
its
utmost
speed
it
was
doubtful
if
so
small
a
vessel
could
make
ten
miles
an
hour
even
with
the
current
in
its
favour
which
is
rather
sluggish
because
of
the
locks
and
the
level
country
sixty
miles
would
place
her
beyond
meulan
which
is
miles
from
the
pont
royal
and
of
course
a
lesser
distance
from
the
pont
de
neuilly
but
the
navigation
of
the
river
is
difficult
at
all
times
and
almost
impossible
after
dark
there
were
chances
of
the
boat
running
aground
and
then
there
was
the
inevitable
delay
at
the
locks
so
i
estimated
that
the
launch
could
not
yet
have
reached
meulan
which
was
less
than
miles
from
paris
by
rail
looking
up
the
timetable
i
saw
there
were
still
two
trains
to
meulan
the
next
at
which
reached
meulan
at
i
therefore
had
time
to
reach
lazare
station
and
accomplish
some
telegraphing
before
the
train
left
with
three
of
my
assistants
i
got
into
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
station
on
arrival
i
sent
one
of
my
men
to
hold
the
train
while
i
went
into
the
telegraph
office
cleared
the
wires
and
got
into
communication
with
the
lock
master
at
meulan
he
replied
that
no
steam
launch
had
passed
down
since
an
hour
before
sunset
i
then
instructed
him
to
allow
the
yacht
to
enter
the
lock
close
the
upper
gate
let
half
of
the
water
out
and
hold
the
vessel
there
until
i
came
i
also
ordered
the
local
meulan
police
to
send
enough
men
to
the
lock
to
enforce
this
command
lastly
i
sent
messages
all
along
the
river
asking
the
police
to
report
to
me
on
the
train
the
passage
of
the
steam
launch
the
is
a
slow
train
stopping
at
every
station
however
every
drawback
has
its
compensation
and
these
stoppages
enabled
me
to
receive
and
to
send
telegraphic
messages
i
was
quite
well
aware
that
i
might
be
on
a
fool
errand
in
going
to
meulan
the
yacht
could
have
put
about
before
it
had
steamed
a
mile
and
so
returned
back
to
paris
there
had
been
no
time
to
learn
whether
this
was
so
or
not
if
i
was
to
catch
the
also
it
might
have
landed
its
passengers
anywhere
along
the
river
i
may
say
at
once
that
neither
of
these
two
things
happened
and
my
calculations
regarding
her
movements
were
accurate
to
the
letter
but
a
trap
most
carefully
set
may
be
prematurely
sprung
by
inadvertence
or
more
often
by
the
of
some
stupid
ass
who
fails
to
understand
his
instructions
or
oversteps
them
if
they
are
understood
i
received
a
most
annoying
telegram
from
denouval
a
lock
about
thirteen
miles
above
that
of
meulan
the
local
policeman
arriving
at
the
lock
found
that
the
yacht
had
just
cleared
the
fool
shouted
to
the
captain
to
return
threatening
him
with
all
the
pains
and
penalties
of
the
law
if
he
refused
the
captain
did
refuse
rung
on
full
speed
ahead
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
through
this
blunder
of
an
understrapper
those
on
board
the
launch
had
received
warning
that
we
were
on
their
track
i
telegraphed
to
the
at
denouval
to
allow
no
craft
to
pass
toward
paris
until
further
orders
we
thus
held
the
launch
in
a
stretch
of
water
but
the
night
was
pitch
dark
and
passengers
might
be
landed
on
either
bank
with
all
france
before
them
over
which
to
effect
their
escape
in
any
direction
it
was
midnight
when
i
reached
the
lock
at
meulan
and
as
was
to
be
expected
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
of
the
launch
it
gave
me
some
satisfaction
to
telegraph
to
that
dunderhead
at
denouval
to
walk
along
the
river
bank
to
meulan
and
report
if
he
learnt
the
whereabouts
we
took
up
our
quarters
in
the
lodgekeeper
house
and
waited
there
was
little
sense
in
sending
men
to
scour
the
country
at
this
time
of
night
for
the
pursued
were
on
the
alert
and
very
unlikely
to
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
if
they
had
gone
ashore
on
the
other
hand
there
was
every
chance
that
the
captain
would
refuse
to
let
them
land
because
he
must
know
his
vessel
was
in
a
trap
from
which
it
could
not
escape
and
although
the
demand
of
the
policeman
at
denouval
was
quite
unauthorised
nevertheless
the
captain
could
not
know
that
while
he
must
be
well
aware
of
his
danger
in
refusing
to
obey
a
command
from
the
authorities
even
if
he
got
away
for
the
moment
he
must
know
that
arrest
was
certain
and
that
his
punishment
would
be
severe
his
only
plea
could
be
that
he
had
not
heard
and
understood
the
order
to
return
but
this
plea
would
be
invalidated
if
he
aided
in
the
escape
of
two
men
whom
he
must
know
were
wanted
by
the
police
i
was
therefore
very
confident
that
if
his
passengers
asked
to
be
set
ashore
the
captain
would
refuse
when
he
had
had
time
to
think
about
his
own
danger
my
estimate
proved
accurate
for
towards
one
the
came
in
and
said
the
green
and
red
lights
of
an
approaching
craft
were
visible
and
as
he
spoke
the
yacht
whistled
for
the
opening
of
the
lock
i
stood
by
the
while
he
opened
the
gates
my
men
and
the
local
police
were
concealed
on
each
side
of
the
lock
the
launch
came
slowly
in
and
as
soon
as
it
had
done
so
i
asked
the
captain
to
step
ashore
which
he
did
wish
a
word
with
you
i
said
me
i
took
him
into
the
house
and
closed
the
door
are
you
going
havre
did
you
come
from
what
quay
the
pont
de
neuilly
did
you
leave
there
five
minutes
to
four
this
afternoon
afternoon
you
mean
afternoon
engaged
you
to
make
this
voyage
american
i
do
not
know
his
name
paid
you
well
i
suppose
paid
me
what
i
asked
you
received
the
money
sir
may
inform
you
captain
that
i
am
eugène
valmont
chief
detective
of
the
french
government
and
that
all
the
police
of
france
at
this
moment
are
under
my
control
i
ask
you
therefore
to
be
careful
of
your
answers
you
were
ordered
by
a
policeman
at
denouval
to
return
why
did
you
not
do
so
ordered
me
to
return
but
as
he
had
no
right
to
order
me
i
went
on
knew
very
well
it
was
the
police
who
ordered
you
and
you
ignored
the
command
again
i
ask
you
why
you
did
so
did
not
know
it
was
the
police
thought
you
would
say
that
you
knew
very
well
but
were
paid
to
take
the
risk
and
it
is
likely
to
cost
you
dear
you
had
two
passengers
aboard
sir
you
put
them
ashore
between
here
and
denouval
sir
but
one
of
them
went
overboard
and
we
could
find
him
again
one
short
man
the
american
is
still
aboard
american
sir
you
must
not
trifle
with
me
the
man
who
engaged
you
is
still
aboard
no
sir
he
has
never
been
aboard
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
second
man
who
came
on
your
launch
at
the
pont
de
neuilly
is
not
the
american
who
engaged
you
sir
the
american
was
a
man
this
man
wore
a
black
beard
a
false
beard
did
not
know
that
sir
i
understood
from
the
american
that
i
was
to
take
but
one
passenger
one
came
aboard
with
a
small
box
in
his
hand
the
other
with
a
small
bag
each
declared
himself
to
be
the
passenger
in
question
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
so
i
left
paris
with
both
of
them
on
board
the
tall
man
with
the
black
beard
is
still
with
you
sir
captain
is
there
anything
else
you
have
to
tell
me
i
think
you
will
find
it
better
in
the
end
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
the
captain
hesitated
turning
his
cap
about
in
his
hands
for
a
few
moments
then
he
said
am
not
sure
that
the
first
passenger
went
overboard
of
his
own
accord
when
the
police
hailed
us
at
denouval
you
knew
it
was
the
police
then
was
afraid
after
i
left
it
might
have
been
you
see
when
the
bargain
was
made
with
me
the
american
said
that
if
i
reached
havre
at
a
certain
time
a
thousand
francs
extra
would
be
paid
to
me
so
i
was
anxious
to
get
along
as
quickly
as
i
could
i
told
him
it
was
dangerous
to
navigate
the
seine
at
night
but
he
paid
me
well
for
attempting
it
after
the
policeman
called
to
us
at
denouval
the
man
with
the
small
box
became
very
much
excited
and
asked
me
to
put
him
ashore
which
i
refused
to
do
the
tall
man
appeared
to
be
watching
him
never
letting
him
get
far
away
when
i
heard
the
splash
in
the
water
i
ran
aft
and
i
saw
the
tall
man
putting
the
box
which
the
other
had
held
into
his
handbag
although
i
said
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
we
cruised
back
and
forward
about
the
spot
where
the
other
man
had
gone
overboard
but
saw
nothing
more
of
him
then
i
came
on
to
meulan
intending
to
give
information
about
what
i
had
seen
that
is
all
i
know
of
the
matter
sir
the
man
who
had
the
jewels
a
frenchman
jewels
sir
man
with
the
small
box
yes
sir
he
was
french
have
hinted
that
the
foreigner
threw
him
overboard
what
grounds
have
you
for
such
a
belief
if
you
did
not
see
the
struggle
night
is
very
dark
sir
and
i
did
not
see
what
happened
i
was
at
the
wheel
in
the
forward
part
of
the
launch
with
my
back
turned
to
these
two
i
heard
a
scream
then
a
splash
if
the
man
had
jumped
overboard
as
the
other
said
he
did
he
would
not
have
screamed
besides
as
i
told
you
when
i
ran
aft
i
saw
the
foreigner
put
the
little
box
in
his
handbag
which
he
shut
up
quickly
as
if
he
did
not
wish
me
to
notice
good
captain
if
you
have
told
the
truth
it
will
go
easier
with
you
in
the
investigation
that
is
to
follow
i
now
turned
the
captain
over
to
one
of
my
men
and
ordered
in
the
foreigner
with
his
bag
and
bogus
black
whiskers
before
questioning
him
i
ordered
him
to
open
the
handbag
which
he
did
with
evident
reluctance
it
was
filled
with
false
whiskers
false
moustaches
and
various
bottles
but
on
top
of
them
all
lay
the
jewel
case
i
raised
the
lid
and
displayed
that
accursed
necklace
i
looked
up
at
the
man
who
stood
there
calmly
enough
saying
nothing
in
spite
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
against
him
you
oblige
me
by
removing
your
false
beard
he
did
so
at
once
throwing
it
into
the
open
bag
i
knew
the
moment
i
saw
him
that
he
was
not
the
american
and
thus
my
theory
had
broken
down
in
one
very
important
part
at
least
informing
him
who
i
was
and
cautioning
him
to
speak
the
truth
i
asked
how
he
came
in
possession
of
the
jewels
i
under
arrest
he
asked
certainly
i
replied
what
am
i
accused
are
accused
in
the
first
place
of
being
in
possession
of
property
which
does
not
belong
to
you
plead
guilty
to
that
what
in
the
second
place
the
second
place
you
may
find
yourself
accused
of
murder
am
innocent
of
the
second
charge
the
man
jumped
overboard
that
is
true
why
did
he
scream
as
he
went
over
too
late
to
recover
his
balance
i
seized
this
box
and
held
it
was
in
rightful
possession
of
the
box
the
owner
gave
it
to
him
admit
that
i
saw
the
owner
give
it
to
him
why
should
he
jump
overboard
do
not
know
he
seemed
to
become
when
the
police
at
the
last
lock
ordered
us
to
return
he
implored
the
captain
to
put
him
ashore
and
from
that
moment
i
watched
him
keenly
expecting
that
if
we
drew
near
to
the
land
he
would
attempt
to
escape
as
the
captain
had
refused
to
beach
the
launch
he
remained
quiet
for
about
half
an
hour
seated
on
a
camp
chair
by
the
rail
with
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
shore
trying
as
i
imagined
to
penetrate
the
darkness
and
estimate
the
distance
then
suddenly
he
sprung
up
and
made
his
dash
i
was
prepared
for
this
and
instantly
caught
the
box
from
his
hand
he
gave
a
half
turn
trying
either
to
save
himself
or
to
retain
the
box
then
with
a
scream
went
down
shoulders
first
into
the
water
it
all
happened
within
a
second
after
he
leaped
from
his
chair
admit
yourself
then
indirectly
responsible
for
his
drowning
at
least
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
man
was
drowned
if
able
to
swim
he
could
easily
have
reached
the
river
bank
if
unable
to
swim
why
should
he
attempt
it
encumbered
by
the
box
believe
he
escaped
then
think
so
will
be
lucky
for
you
should
that
prove
to
be
the
case
did
you
come
to
be
in
the
yacht
at
all
shall
give
you
a
full
account
of
the
affair
concealing
nothing
i
am
a
private
detective
with
an
office
in
london
i
was
certain
that
some
attempt
would
be
made
probably
by
the
most
expert
criminals
at
large
to
rob
the
possessor
of
this
necklace
i
came
over
to
paris
anticipating
trouble
determined
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
jewel
case
if
this
proved
possible
if
the
jewels
were
stolen
the
crime
was
bound
to
be
one
of
the
most
celebrated
in
legal
annals
i
was
present
during
the
sale
and
saw
the
buyer
of
the
necklace
i
followed
the
official
who
went
to
the
bank
and
thus
learned
that
the
money
was
behind
the
cheque
i
then
stopped
outside
and
waited
for
the
buyer
to
appear
he
held
the
case
in
his
hand
his
pocket
you
mean
i
interrupted
had
it
in
his
hand
when
i
saw
him
then
the
man
who
afterwards
jumped
overboard
approached
him
took
the
case
without
a
word
held
up
his
hand
for
a
cab
and
when
an
open
vehicle
approached
the
curb
he
stepped
in
saying
the
madeleine
i
hailed
a
closed
cab
instructed
the
cabman
to
follow
the
first
disguising
myself
with
whiskers
as
near
like
those
the
man
in
front
wore
as
i
had
in
my
collection
did
you
do
that
a
detective
you
should
know
why
i
did
it
i
wished
as
nearly
as
possible
to
resemble
the
man
in
front
so
that
if
necessity
arose
i
could
pretend
that
i
was
the
person
commissioned
to
carry
the
jewel
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
crisis
arose
when
we
came
to
the
end
of
our
cab
journey
the
captain
did
not
know
which
was
his
true
passenger
and
so
let
us
both
remain
aboard
the
launch
and
now
you
have
the
whole
story
extremely
improbable
one
sir
even
by
your
own
account
you
had
no
right
to
interfere
in
this
business
at
all
quite
agree
with
you
there
he
replied
with
great
nonchalance
taking
a
card
from
his
which
he
handed
to
me
is
my
london
address
you
may
make
inquiries
and
you
will
find
i
am
exactly
what
i
represent
myself
to
be
the
first
train
for
paris
left
meulan
at
eleven
minutes
past
four
in
the
morning
it
was
now
a
quarter
after
two
i
left
the
captain
crew
and
launch
in
charge
of
two
of
my
men
with
orders
to
proceed
to
paris
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
i
supported
by
the
third
man
waited
at
the
station
with
our
english
prisoner
and
reached
paris
at
five
in
the
morning
the
english
prisoner
though
severely
interrogated
by
the
judge
stood
by
his
story
inquiry
by
the
police
in
london
proved
that
what
he
said
of
himself
was
true
his
case
however
began
to
look
very
serious
when
two
of
the
men
from
the
launch
asserted
that
they
had
seen
him
push
the
frenchman
overboard
and
their
statement
could
not
be
shaken
all
our
energies
were
bent
for
the
next
two
weeks
on
trying
to
find
something
of
the
identity
of
the
missing
man
or
to
get
any
trace
of
the
two
americans
if
the
tall
american
were
alive
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
should
not
have
made
application
for
the
valuable
property
he
had
lost
all
attempts
to
trace
him
by
means
of
the
cheque
on
the
proved
futile
the
bank
pretended
to
give
me
every
assistance
but
i
sometimes
doubt
if
it
actually
did
so
it
had
evidently
been
well
paid
for
its
services
and
evinced
no
impetuous
desire
to
betray
so
good
a
customer
we
made
inquiries
about
every
missing
man
in
paris
but
also
without
result
the
case
had
excited
much
attention
throughout
the
world
and
doubtless
was
published
in
full
in
the
american
papers
the
englishman
had
been
in
custody
three
weeks
when
the
chief
of
police
in
paris
received
the
following
letter
sir
on
my
arrival
in
new
york
by
the
english
steamer
i
was
much
amused
to
read
in
the
papers
accounts
of
the
exploits
of
detectives
french
and
english
i
am
sorry
that
only
one
of
them
seems
to
be
in
prison
i
think
his
french
ought
to
be
there
also
i
regret
exceedingly
however
that
there
is
the
rumour
of
the
death
by
drowning
of
my
friend
martin
dubois
of
rue
aux
juifs
rouen
if
this
is
indeed
the
case
he
has
met
his
death
through
the
blunders
of
the
police
nevertheless
i
wish
you
would
communicate
with
his
family
at
the
address
i
have
given
and
assure
them
that
i
will
make
arrangements
for
their
future
support
beg
to
inform
you
that
i
am
a
manufacturer
of
imitation
diamonds
and
through
extensive
advertising
succeeded
in
accumulating
a
fortune
of
many
millions
i
was
in
europe
when
the
necklace
was
found
and
had
in
my
possession
over
a
thousand
imitation
diamonds
of
my
own
manufacture
it
occurred
to
me
that
here
was
the
opportunity
of
the
most
magnificent
advertisement
in
the
world
i
saw
the
necklace
received
its
measurements
and
also
obtained
photographs
of
it
taken
by
the
french
government
then
i
set
my
expert
friend
martin
dubois
at
work
and
with
the
artificial
stones
i
gave
him
he
made
an
imitation
necklace
so
closely
resembling
the
original
that
you
apparently
do
not
know
it
is
the
unreal
you
have
in
your
possession
i
did
not
fear
the
villainy
of
the
crooks
as
much
as
the
blundering
of
the
police
who
would
have
protected
me
with
vehemence
if
i
could
not
elude
them
i
knew
that
the
detectives
would
overlook
the
obvious
but
would
at
once
follow
a
clue
if
i
provided
one
for
them
consequently
i
laid
my
plans
just
as
you
have
discovered
and
got
martin
dubois
up
from
rouen
to
carry
the
case
i
gave
him
down
to
havre
i
had
had
another
box
prepared
and
wrapped
in
brown
paper
with
my
address
in
new
york
written
thereon
the
moment
i
emerged
from
the
auction
room
while
my
friend
the
cowboy
was
holding
up
the
audience
i
turned
my
face
to
the
door
took
out
the
genuine
diamonds
from
the
case
and
slipped
it
into
the
box
i
had
prepared
for
mailing
into
the
genuine
case
i
put
the
bogus
diamonds
after
handing
the
box
to
dubois
i
turned
down
a
side
street
and
then
into
another
whose
name
i
do
not
know
and
there
in
a
shop
with
sealing
wax
and
string
did
up
the
real
diamonds
for
posting
i
labelled
the
package
books
went
to
the
nearest
post
office
paid
letter
postage
and
handed
it
over
unregistered
as
if
it
were
of
no
particular
value
after
this
i
went
to
my
rooms
in
the
grand
hotel
where
i
had
been
staying
under
my
own
name
for
more
than
a
month
next
morning
i
took
train
for
london
and
the
day
after
sailed
from
liverpool
on
the
i
arrived
before
the
which
sailed
from
havre
on
saturday
met
my
box
at
the
customs
house
paid
duty
and
it
now
reposes
in
my
safe
i
intend
to
construct
an
imitation
necklace
which
will
be
so
like
the
genuine
one
that
nobody
can
tell
the
two
apart
then
i
shall
come
to
europe
and
exhibit
the
pair
for
the
publication
of
the
truth
of
this
matter
will
give
me
the
greatest
advertisement
that
ever
was
truly
p
hazard
i
at
once
communicated
with
rouen
and
found
martin
dubois
alive
and
well
his
first
words
were
swear
i
did
not
steal
the
jewels
he
had
swum
ashore
tramped
to
rouen
and
kept
quiet
in
great
fear
while
i
was
fruitlessly
searching
paris
for
him
it
took
mr
hazard
longer
to
make
his
imitation
necklace
than
he
supposed
and
several
years
later
he
booked
his
passage
with
the
two
necklaces
on
the
steamer
and
now
rests
beside
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
full
many
a
gem
of
purest
ray
serene
the
dark
unfathomed
caves
of
ocean
bear
siamese
twin
of
a
the
events
previously
related
in
mystery
of
the
five
hundred
diamonds
led
to
my
dismissal
by
the
french
government
it
was
not
because
i
had
arrested
an
innocent
man
i
had
done
that
dozens
of
times
before
with
nothing
said
about
it
it
was
not
because
i
had
followed
a
wrong
clue
or
because
i
had
failed
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
five
hundred
diamonds
every
detective
follows
a
wrong
clue
now
and
then
and
every
detective
fails
more
often
than
he
cares
to
admit
no
all
these
things
would
not
have
shaken
my
position
but
the
newspapers
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
something
humorous
in
the
case
and
for
weeks
paris
rang
with
laughter
over
my
exploits
and
my
defeat
the
fact
that
the
chief
french
detective
had
placed
the
most
celebrated
english
detective
into
prison
and
that
each
of
them
were
busily
a
bogus
clue
deliberately
flung
across
their
path
by
an
amateur
roused
all
france
to
great
hilarity
the
government
was
furious
the
englishman
was
released
and
i
was
dismissed
since
the
year
i
have
been
a
resident
of
london
when
a
man
is
as
one
might
say
the
guest
of
a
country
it
does
not
become
him
to
criticise
that
country
i
have
studied
this
strange
people
with
interest
and
often
with
astonishment
and
if
i
now
set
down
some
of
the
differences
between
the
english
and
the
french
i
trust
that
no
note
of
criticism
of
the
former
will
appear
even
when
my
sympathies
are
entirely
with
the
latter
these
differences
have
sunk
deeply
into
my
mind
because
during
the
first
years
of
my
stay
in
london
my
lack
of
understanding
them
was
often
a
cause
of
my
own
failure
when
i
thought
i
had
success
in
hand
many
a
time
did
i
come
to
the
verge
of
starvation
in
soho
through
not
appreciating
the
peculiar
trend
of
mind
which
causes
an
englishman
to
do
inexplicable
things
that
is
of
course
from
my
gallic
standpoint
for
instance
an
arrested
man
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
he
is
proved
guilty
in
england
if
a
murderer
is
caught
over
his
victim
he
is
held
guiltless
until
the
judge
sentences
him
in
france
we
make
no
such
foolish
assumption
and
although
i
admit
that
innocent
men
have
sometimes
been
punished
my
experience
enables
me
to
state
very
emphatically
that
this
happens
not
nearly
so
often
as
the
public
imagines
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
an
innocent
man
can
at
once
prove
his
innocence
without
the
least
difficulty
i
hold
it
is
his
duty
towards
the
state
to
run
the
very
slight
risk
of
unjust
imprisonment
in
order
that
obstacles
may
not
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
the
conviction
of
real
criminals
but
it
is
impossible
to
persuade
an
englishman
of
this
dieu
i
have
tried
it
often
enough
never
shall
i
forget
the
bitterness
of
my
disappointment
when
i
captured
felini
the
italian
anarchist
in
connection
with
the
greenwich
park
murder
at
this
time
it
gives
me
no
shame
to
confess
it
i
was
myself
living
in
soho
in
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
having
been
employed
so
long
by
the
french
government
i
had
formed
the
absurd
idea
that
the
future
depended
on
my
getting
not
exactly
a
similar
connection
with
scotland
yard
but
at
least
a
subordinate
position
on
the
police
force
which
would
enable
me
to
prove
my
capabilities
and
lead
to
promotion
i
had
no
knowledge
at
that
time
of
the
immense
income
which
awaited
me
entirely
outside
the
government
circle
whether
it
is
contempt
for
the
foreigner
as
has
often
been
stated
or
that
native
stolidity
which
spells
complacency
the
british
official
of
any
class
rarely
thinks
it
worth
his
while
to
discover
the
real
cause
of
things
in
france
or
germany
or
russia
but
plods
heavily
on
from
one
mistake
to
another
take
for
example
those
periodical
outbursts
of
hatred
against
england
which
appear
in
the
continental
press
they
create
a
dangerous
international
situation
and
more
than
once
have
brought
britain
to
the
verge
of
a
serious
war
britain
sternly
spends
millions
in
defence
and
preparation
whereas
if
she
would
place
in
my
hand
half
a
million
pounds
i
would
guarantee
to
cause
britannia
to
be
proclaimed
an
angel
with
white
wings
in
every
european
country
when
i
attempted
to
arrive
at
some
connection
with
scotland
yard
i
was
invariably
asked
for
my
credentials
when
i
proclaimed
that
i
had
been
chief
detective
to
the
republic
of
france
i
could
see
that
this
announcement
made
a
serious
impression
but
when
i
added
that
the
government
of
france
had
dismissed
me
without
credentials
recommendation
or
pension
official
sympathy
with
officialism
at
once
turned
the
tables
against
me
and
here
i
may
be
pardoned
for
pointing
out
another
portentous
dissimilarity
between
the
two
lands
which
i
think
is
not
at
all
to
the
credit
of
my
countrymen
i
was
summarily
dismissed
you
may
say
it
was
because
i
failed
and
it
is
true
that
in
the
case
of
the
queen
necklace
i
had
undoubtedly
failed
but
on
the
other
hand
i
had
followed
unerringly
the
clue
which
lay
in
my
path
and
although
the
conclusion
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
facts
it
was
in
accordance
with
logic
no
i
was
not
dismissed
because
i
failed
i
had
failed
on
various
occasions
before
as
might
happen
to
any
man
in
any
profession
i
was
dismissed
because
i
made
france
for
the
moment
the
of
europe
and
america
france
dismissed
me
because
france
had
been
laughed
at
no
frenchman
can
endure
the
turning
of
a
joke
against
him
but
the
englishman
does
not
appear
to
care
in
the
least
so
far
as
failure
is
concerned
never
had
any
man
failed
so
egregiously
as
i
did
with
felini
a
slippery
criminal
who
possessed
all
the
bravery
of
a
frenchman
and
all
the
subtlety
of
an
italian
three
times
he
was
in
my
hands
twice
in
paris
once
in
marseilles
and
each
time
he
escaped
me
yet
i
was
not
dismissed
when
i
say
that
signor
felini
was
as
brave
as
a
frenchman
perhaps
i
do
him
a
little
more
than
justice
he
was
desperately
afraid
of
one
man
and
that
man
was
myself
our
last
interview
in
france
he
is
not
likely
to
forget
and
although
he
eluded
me
he
took
good
care
to
get
into
england
as
fast
as
train
and
boat
could
carry
him
and
never
again
while
i
was
at
the
head
of
the
french
detective
force
did
he
set
foot
on
french
soil
he
was
an
educated
villain
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
turin
who
spoke
spanish
french
and
english
as
well
as
his
own
language
and
this
education
made
him
all
the
more
dangerous
when
he
turned
his
talents
to
crime
now
i
knew
felini
handiwork
either
in
murder
or
in
housebreaking
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
signature
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
in
greenwich
park
i
was
certain
felini
was
the
murderer
the
english
authorities
at
that
time
looked
upon
me
with
a
tolerant
contempt
inspector
standish
assumed
the
manner
of
a
man
placing
at
my
disposal
plenty
of
rope
with
which
i
might
entangle
myself
he
appeared
to
think
me
excitable
and
used
soothing
expressions
as
if
i
were
a
fractious
child
to
be
calmed
rather
than
a
sane
equal
to
be
reasoned
with
on
many
occasions
i
had
the
facts
at
my
finger
ends
while
he
remained
in
a
state
of
most
complacent
ignorance
and
though
this
attitude
of
lowering
himself
to
deal
gently
with
one
whom
he
evidently
looked
upon
as
an
irresponsible
lunatic
was
most
exasperating
i
nevertheless
claim
great
credit
for
having
kept
my
temper
with
him
however
it
turned
out
to
be
impossible
for
me
to
overcome
his
insular
prejudice
he
always
supposed
me
to
be
a
frivolous
volatile
person
and
so
i
was
unable
to
prove
myself
of
any
value
to
him
in
his
arduous
duties
the
felini
instance
was
my
last
endeavour
to
win
his
favour
inspector
standish
appeared
in
his
most
amiable
mood
when
i
was
admitted
to
his
presence
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
london
was
ringing
with
the
greenwich
park
tragedy
while
the
police
possessed
not
the
faintest
idea
regarding
the
crime
or
its
perpetrator
i
judged
from
inspector
standish
benevolent
smile
that
i
was
somewhat
excited
when
i
spoke
to
him
and
perhaps
used
many
gestures
which
seemed
superfluous
to
a
large
man
whom
i
should
describe
as
immovable
and
who
spoke
slowly
with
no
motion
of
the
hand
as
if
his
utterances
were
the
condensed
wisdom
of
the
ages
standish
i
cried
it
within
your
power
to
arrest
a
man
on
suspicion
course
it
is
he
replied
we
must
harbour
the
suspicion
before
we
make
the
arrest
confidence
in
me
i
exclaimed
man
who
committed
the
greenwich
park
murder
is
an
italian
named
felini
i
gave
the
address
of
the
exact
room
in
which
he
was
to
be
found
with
cautions
regarding
the
elusive
nature
of
this
individual
i
said
that
he
had
been
three
times
in
my
custody
and
those
three
times
he
had
slipped
through
my
fingers
i
have
since
thought
that
inspector
standish
did
not
credit
a
word
i
had
spoken
is
your
proof
against
this
italian
asked
the
inspector
slowly
proof
is
on
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
but
nevertheless
if
you
suddenly
confront
felini
with
me
without
giving
him
any
hint
of
whom
he
is
going
to
meet
you
shall
have
the
evidence
from
his
own
lips
before
he
recovers
from
his
surprise
and
fright
something
of
my
confidence
must
have
impressed
the
official
for
the
order
of
arrest
was
made
now
during
the
absence
of
the
constable
sent
to
bring
in
felini
i
explained
to
the
inspector
fully
the
details
of
my
plan
practically
he
did
not
listen
to
me
for
his
head
was
bent
over
a
on
which
i
thought
he
was
taking
down
my
remarks
but
when
i
had
finished
he
went
on
writing
as
before
so
i
saw
i
had
flattered
myself
unnecessarily
more
than
two
hours
passed
before
the
constable
returned
bringing
with
him
the
trembling
italian
i
swung
round
in
front
of
him
and
cried
in
a
menacing
voice
regard
me
you
know
valmont
too
well
to
trifle
with
him
what
have
you
to
say
of
the
murder
in
greenwich
park
i
give
you
my
word
that
the
italian
collapsed
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
in
a
heap
had
not
the
constables
upheld
him
with
hands
under
each
arm
his
face
became
of
a
pasty
whiteness
and
he
began
to
stammer
his
confession
when
this
incredible
thing
happened
which
could
not
be
believed
in
france
inspector
standish
held
up
his
finger
moment
he
cautioned
solemnly
that
whatever
you
say
will
be
used
against
you
the
quick
beady
black
eyes
of
the
italian
shot
from
standish
to
me
and
from
me
to
standish
in
an
instant
his
alert
mind
grasped
the
situation
metaphorically
i
had
been
waved
aside
i
was
not
there
in
any
official
capacity
and
he
saw
in
a
moment
with
what
an
opaque
intellect
he
had
to
deal
the
italian
closed
his
mouth
like
a
steel
trap
and
refused
to
utter
a
word
shortly
after
he
was
liberated
as
there
was
no
evidence
against
him
when
at
last
complete
proof
was
in
the
tardy
hands
of
the
british
authorities
the
agile
felini
was
safe
in
the
apennine
mountains
and
today
is
serving
a
life
sentence
in
italy
for
the
assassination
of
a
senator
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
threw
up
my
hands
in
despair
at
finding
myself
amongst
such
a
people
but
this
was
in
the
early
days
and
now
that
i
have
greater
experience
of
the
english
many
of
my
first
opinions
have
been
modified
i
mention
all
this
to
explain
why
in
a
private
capacity
i
often
did
what
no
english
official
would
dare
to
do
a
people
who
will
send
a
policeman
without
even
a
pistol
to
protect
him
to
arrest
a
desperate
criminal
in
the
most
dangerous
quarter
of
london
can
not
be
comprehended
by
any
native
of
france
italy
spain
or
germany
when
i
began
to
succeed
as
a
private
detective
in
london
and
had
accumulated
money
enough
for
my
project
i
determined
not
to
be
hampered
by
this
unexplainable
softness
of
the
english
toward
an
accused
person
i
therefore
reconstructed
my
flat
and
placed
in
the
centre
of
it
a
dark
room
strong
as
any
bastille
cell
it
was
twelve
feet
square
and
contained
no
furniture
except
a
number
of
shelves
a
lavatory
in
one
corner
and
a
pallet
on
the
floor
it
was
ventilated
by
two
flues
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
in
one
of
which
operated
an
electric
fan
which
when
the
room
was
occupied
sent
the
foul
air
up
that
flue
and
drew
down
fresh
air
through
the
other
the
entrance
to
this
cell
opened
out
from
my
bedroom
and
the
most
minute
inspection
would
have
failed
to
reveal
the
door
which
was
of
massive
steel
and
was
opened
and
shut
by
electric
buttons
that
were
partially
concealed
by
the
head
of
my
bed
even
if
they
had
been
discovered
they
would
have
revealed
nothing
because
the
first
turn
of
the
button
lit
the
electric
light
at
the
head
of
my
bed
the
second
turn
put
it
out
and
this
would
happen
as
often
as
the
button
was
turned
to
the
right
but
turn
it
three
times
slowly
to
the
left
and
the
steel
door
opened
its
juncture
was
completely
concealed
by
panelling
i
have
brought
many
a
scoundrel
to
reason
within
the
impregnable
walls
of
that
small
room
those
who
know
the
building
regulations
of
london
will
wonder
how
it
was
possible
for
me
to
delude
the
government
inspector
during
the
erection
of
this
section
of
the
bastille
in
the
midst
of
the
modern
metropolis
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
liberty
of
the
subject
is
the
first
great
rule
with
the
english
people
and
thus
many
a
criminal
is
allowed
to
escape
here
was
i
laying
plans
for
the
contravening
of
this
first
great
rule
and
to
do
so
i
took
advantage
of
the
second
great
rule
of
the
english
people
which
is
that
property
is
sacred
i
told
the
building
authorities
i
was
a
rich
man
with
a
great
distrust
of
banks
and
i
wished
to
build
in
my
flat
a
safe
or
in
which
to
deposit
my
valuables
i
built
then
such
a
room
as
may
be
found
in
every
bank
and
many
private
premises
of
the
city
and
a
tenant
might
have
lived
in
my
flat
for
a
year
and
never
suspected
the
existence
of
this
prison
a
railway
engine
might
have
screeched
its
whistle
within
it
and
not
a
sound
would
have
penetrated
the
apartments
that
surrounded
it
unless
the
door
were
open
but
besides
eugène
valmont
dressed
in
elegant
attire
as
if
he
were
still
a
boulevardier
of
paris
occupier
of
the
top
floor
in
the
imperial
flats
there
was
another
frenchman
in
london
to
whom
i
must
introduce
you
namely
professor
paul
ducharme
who
occupied
a
squalid
back
room
in
the
cheapest
and
most
undesirable
quarter
of
soho
valmont
flatters
himself
he
is
not
yet
but
poor
ducharme
does
not
need
his
sparse
gray
beard
to
proclaim
his
advancing
years
valmont
vaunts
an
air
of
prosperity
ducharme
wears
the
shabby
habiliments
and
the
of
hopeless
poverty
he
shuffles
cringingly
along
the
street
a
compatriot
not
to
be
proud
of
there
are
so
many
frenchmen
anxious
to
give
lessons
in
their
language
that
merely
a
small
living
is
to
be
picked
up
by
any
one
of
them
you
will
never
see
the
spruce
valmont
walking
alongside
the
dejected
ducharme
you
exclaim
in
his
prosperity
has
forgotten
those
less
fortunate
of
his
nationality
pardon
my
friends
it
is
not
so
behold
i
proclaim
to
you
the
exquisite
valmont
and
the
threadbare
ducharme
are
one
and
the
same
person
that
is
why
they
do
not
promenade
together
and
indeed
it
requires
no
great
histrionic
art
on
my
part
to
act
the
rôle
of
the
miserable
ducharme
for
when
i
first
came
to
london
i
warded
off
starvation
in
this
wretched
room
and
my
hand
it
was
that
nailed
to
the
door
the
painted
sign
paul
ducharme
teacher
of
the
french
language
i
never
gave
up
the
room
even
when
i
became
prosperous
and
moved
to
imperial
flats
with
its
concealed
chamber
of
horrors
unknown
to
british
authority
i
did
not
give
up
the
soho
chamber
principally
for
this
reason
paul
ducharme
if
the
truth
were
known
about
him
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
dangerous
character
yet
this
was
a
character
sometimes
necessary
for
me
to
assume
he
was
a
member
of
the
very
inner
circle
of
the
international
an
anarchist
of
the
anarchists
this
malign
organisation
has
its
real
headquarters
in
london
and
we
who
were
officials
connected
with
the
secret
service
of
the
continent
have
more
than
once
cursed
the
complacency
of
the
british
government
which
allows
such
a
nest
of
vipers
to
exist
practically
unmolested
i
confess
that
before
i
came
to
know
the
english
people
as
well
as
i
do
now
i
thought
that
this
complacency
was
due
to
utter
selfishness
because
the
anarchists
never
commit
an
outrage
in
england
england
is
the
one
spot
on
the
map
of
europe
where
an
anarchist
can
not
be
laid
by
the
heels
unless
there
is
evidence
against
him
that
will
stand
the
test
of
open
court
anarchists
take
advantage
of
this
fact
and
plots
are
hatched
in
london
which
are
executed
in
paris
berlin
petersburg
or
madrid
i
know
now
that
this
leniency
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
does
not
arise
from
craft
but
from
their
unexplainable
devotion
to
their
shibboleth
liberty
of
the
subject
time
and
again
france
has
demanded
the
extradition
of
an
anarchist
always
to
be
met
with
the
question
is
your
proof
i
know
many
instances
where
our
certainty
was
absolute
and
also
cases
where
we
possessed
legal
proof
as
well
but
legal
proof
which
for
one
reason
or
another
we
dared
not
use
in
public
yet
all
this
had
no
effect
on
the
british
authorities
they
would
never
give
up
even
the
vilest
criminal
except
on
publicly
attested
legal
evidence
and
not
even
then
if
the
crime
were
political
during
my
term
of
office
under
the
french
government
no
part
of
my
duties
caused
me
more
anxiety
than
that
which
pertained
to
the
political
secret
societies
of
course
with
a
large
portion
of
the
secret
service
fund
at
my
disposal
i
was
able
to
buy
expert
assistance
and
even
to
get
information
from
anarchists
themselves
this
latter
device
however
was
always
more
or
less
unreliable
i
have
never
yet
met
an
anarchist
i
could
believe
on
oath
and
when
one
of
them
offered
to
sell
exclusive
information
to
the
police
we
rarely
knew
whether
he
was
merely
trying
to
get
a
few
francs
to
keep
himself
from
starving
or
whether
he
was
giving
us
false
particulars
which
would
lead
us
into
a
trap
i
have
always
regarded
our
dealings
with
nihilists
anarchists
or
other
secret
associations
for
the
perpetrating
of
murder
as
the
most
dangerous
service
a
detective
is
called
upon
to
perform
yet
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
authorities
should
know
what
is
going
on
in
these
secret
conclaves
there
are
three
methods
of
getting
this
intelligence
first
periodical
raids
upon
the
suspected
accompanied
by
confiscation
and
search
of
all
papers
found
this
method
is
much
in
favour
with
the
russian
police
i
have
always
regarded
it
as
largely
futile
first
because
the
anarchists
are
not
such
fools
speaking
generally
as
to
commit
their
purposes
to
writing
and
second
because
it
leads
to
reprisal
each
raid
is
usually
followed
by
a
fresh
outbreak
of
activity
on
the
part
of
those
left
free
the
second
method
is
to
bribe
an
anarchist
to
betray
his
comrades
i
have
never
found
any
difficulty
in
getting
these
gentry
to
accept
money
they
are
eternally
in
need
but
i
usually
find
the
information
they
give
in
return
to
be
either
unimportant
or
inaccurate
there
remains
then
the
third
method
which
is
to
place
a
spy
among
them
the
spy
battalion
is
the
forlorn
hope
of
the
detective
service
in
one
year
i
lost
three
men
on
anarchist
duty
among
the
victims
being
my
most
valuable
helper
henri
brisson
poor
brisson
fate
was
an
example
of
how
a
man
may
follow
a
perilous
occupation
for
months
with
safety
and
then
by
a
slight
mistake
bring
disaster
on
himself
at
the
last
gathering
brisson
attended
he
received
news
of
such
immediate
and
fateful
import
that
on
emerging
from
the
cellar
where
the
gathering
was
held
he
made
directly
for
my
residence
instead
of
going
to
his
own
squalid
room
in
the
rue
falgarie
my
concierge
said
that
he
arrived
shortly
after
one
in
the
morning
and
it
would
seem
that
at
this
hour
he
could
easily
have
made
himself
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
he
was
followed
still
as
there
was
on
his
track
that
human
panther
felini
it
is
not
strange
poor
brisson
failed
to
elude
him
arriving
at
the
tall
building
in
which
my
flat
was
then
situated
brisson
rang
the
bell
and
the
concierge
as
usual
in
that
strange
state
of
which
envelops
concierges
during
the
night
pulled
the
looped
wire
at
the
head
of
his
bed
and
unbolted
the
door
brisson
assuredly
closed
the
huge
door
behind
him
and
yet
the
moment
before
he
did
so
felini
must
have
slipped
in
unnoticed
to
the
courtyard
if
brisson
had
not
spoken
and
announced
himself
the
concierge
would
have
been
wide
awake
in
an
instant
if
he
had
given
a
name
unknown
to
the
concierge
the
same
result
would
have
ensued
as
it
was
he
cried
aloud
whereupon
the
concierge
of
the
famous
chief
of
the
french
detective
staff
valmont
muttered
and
was
instantly
asleep
again
now
felini
had
known
brisson
well
but
it
was
under
the
name
of
revensky
and
as
an
exiled
russian
brisson
had
spent
all
his
early
years
in
russia
and
spoke
the
language
like
a
native
the
moment
brisson
had
uttered
his
true
name
he
had
pronounced
his
own
death
warrant
felini
followed
him
up
to
the
first
landing
my
rooms
were
on
the
second
floor
and
there
placed
his
sign
manual
on
the
unfortunate
man
which
was
the
swift
downward
stroke
of
a
long
narrow
sharp
poniard
entering
the
body
below
the
shoulders
and
piercing
the
heart
the
advantage
presented
by
this
terrible
blow
is
that
the
victim
sinks
instantly
in
a
heap
at
the
feet
of
his
slayer
without
uttering
a
moan
the
wound
left
is
a
scarcely
perceptible
blue
mark
which
rarely
even
bleeds
it
was
this
mark
i
saw
on
the
body
of
the
maire
of
marseilles
and
afterwards
on
one
other
in
paris
besides
poor
brisson
it
was
the
mark
found
on
the
man
in
greenwich
park
always
just
below
the
left
struck
from
behind
comrades
claim
that
there
was
this
nobility
in
his
action
namely
he
allowed
the
traitor
to
prove
himself
before
he
struck
the
blow
i
should
be
sorry
to
take
away
this
poor
shred
of
credit
from
character
but
the
reason
he
followed
brisson
into
the
courtyard
was
to
give
himself
time
to
escape
he
knew
perfectly
the
ways
of
the
concierge
he
knew
that
the
body
would
lie
there
until
the
morning
as
it
actually
did
and
that
this
would
give
him
hours
in
which
to
effect
his
retreat
and
this
was
the
man
whom
british
law
warned
not
to
incriminate
himself
what
a
people
what
a
people
after
brisson
tragic
death
i
resolved
to
set
no
more
valuable
men
on
the
track
of
the
anarchists
but
to
place
upon
myself
the
task
in
my
moments
of
relaxation
i
became
very
much
interested
in
the
underground
workings
of
the
international
i
joined
the
organisation
under
the
name
of
paul
ducharme
a
professor
of
advanced
opinions
who
because
of
them
had
been
dismissed
his
situation
in
nantes
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
such
a
paul
ducharme
who
had
been
so
dismissed
but
he
had
drowned
himself
in
the
loire
at
orleans
as
the
records
show
i
adopted
the
precaution
of
getting
a
photograph
of
this
foolish
old
man
from
the
police
at
nantes
and
made
myself
up
to
resemble
him
it
says
much
for
my
disguise
that
i
was
recognised
as
the
professor
by
a
delegate
from
nantes
at
the
annual
convention
held
in
paris
which
i
attended
and
although
we
conversed
for
some
time
together
he
never
suspected
that
i
was
not
the
professor
whose
fate
was
known
to
no
one
but
the
police
of
orleans
i
gained
much
credit
among
my
comrades
because
of
this
encounter
which
during
its
first
few
moments
filled
me
with
dismay
for
the
delegate
from
nantes
held
me
up
as
an
example
of
a
man
well
off
who
had
deliberately
sacrificed
his
worldly
position
for
the
sake
of
principle
shortly
after
this
i
was
chosen
delegate
to
carry
a
message
to
our
comrades
in
london
and
this
delicate
undertaking
passed
off
without
mishap
it
was
perhaps
natural
then
that
when
i
came
to
london
after
my
dismissal
by
the
french
government
i
should
assume
the
name
and
appearance
of
paul
ducharme
and
adopt
the
profession
of
french
teacher
this
profession
gave
me
great
advantages
i
could
be
absent
from
my
rooms
for
hours
at
a
time
without
attracting
the
least
attention
because
a
teacher
goes
wherever
there
are
pupils
if
any
of
my
anarchist
comrades
saw
me
emerging
shabbily
from
the
grand
imperial
flats
where
valmont
lived
he
greeted
me
affably
thinking
i
was
coming
from
a
pupil
the
sumptuous
flat
was
therefore
the
office
in
which
i
received
my
rich
clients
while
the
squalid
room
in
soho
was
often
the
workshop
in
which
the
tasks
entrusted
to
me
were
brought
to
completion
i
now
come
to
very
modern
days
indeed
when
i
spent
much
time
with
the
emissaries
of
the
international
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
king
of
england
made
a
round
of
visits
to
european
capitals
the
results
of
which
in
the
interest
of
peace
we
perhaps
do
not
yet
fully
understand
and
appreciate
his
visit
to
paris
was
the
beginning
of
the
present
and
i
betray
no
confidence
when
i
say
that
this
brief
official
call
at
the
french
capital
was
the
occasion
of
great
anxiety
to
the
government
of
my
own
country
and
also
of
that
in
which
i
was
domiciled
anarchists
are
against
all
government
and
would
like
to
see
each
one
destroyed
not
even
excepting
that
of
great
britain
my
task
in
connection
with
the
visit
of
king
edward
to
paris
was
entirely
unofficial
a
nobleman
for
whom
on
a
previous
occasion
i
had
been
so
happy
as
to
solve
a
little
mystery
which
troubled
him
complimented
me
by
calling
at
my
flat
about
two
weeks
before
the
king
entry
into
the
french
capital
i
know
i
shall
be
pardoned
if
i
fail
to
mention
this
nobleman
name
i
gathered
that
the
intended
visit
of
the
king
met
with
his
disapproval
he
asked
if
i
knew
anything
or
could
discover
anything
of
the
purposes
animating
the
anarchist
clubs
of
paris
and
their
attitude
towards
the
royal
function
which
was
now
the
chief
topic
in
the
newspapers
i
replied
that
within
four
days
i
would
be
able
to
submit
to
him
a
complete
report
on
the
subject
he
bowed
coldly
and
withdrew
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
i
permitted
myself
the
happiness
of
waiting
upon
his
lordship
at
his
west
end
london
mansion
have
the
honour
to
report
to
your
lordship
i
began
the
anarchists
of
paris
are
somewhat
divided
in
their
opinions
regarding
his
majesty
forthcoming
progress
through
that
city
a
minority
contemptible
in
point
of
number
but
important
so
far
as
the
extremity
of
their
opinions
are
concerned
has
been
trying
me
interrupted
the
nobleman
with
some
severity
of
tone
they
going
to
attempt
to
injure
the
king
or
not
are
not
your
lordship
i
replied
with
what
i
trust
is
my
usual
urbanity
of
manner
despite
his
curt
interpolation
most
gracious
majesty
will
suffer
no
molestation
and
their
reason
for
quiescence
reasons
do
not
interest
me
put
in
his
lordship
gruffly
are
sure
of
what
you
say
sure
your
lordship
precautions
need
be
taken
in
the
least
your
lordship
well
concluded
the
nobleman
shortly
you
tell
my
secretary
in
the
next
room
as
you
go
out
how
much
i
owe
you
he
will
hand
you
a
cheque
and
with
that
i
was
dismissed
i
may
say
that
mixing
as
i
do
with
the
highest
in
two
lands
and
meeting
invariably
such
courtesy
as
i
myself
am
always
eager
to
bestow
a
feeling
almost
of
resentment
arose
at
this
cavalier
treatment
however
i
merely
bowed
somewhat
ceremoniously
in
silence
and
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
in
the
next
room
to
double
my
bill
which
was
paid
without
demur
now
if
this
nobleman
had
but
listened
he
would
have
heard
much
that
might
interest
an
ordinary
man
although
i
must
say
that
during
my
three
conversations
with
him
his
mind
seemed
closed
to
all
outward
impressions
save
and
except
the
grandeur
of
his
line
which
he
traced
back
unblemished
into
the
northern
part
of
my
own
country
the
king
visit
had
come
as
a
surprise
to
the
anarchists
and
they
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
about
it
the
paris
reds
were
rather
in
favour
of
a
demonstration
while
london
bade
them
in
god
name
to
hold
their
hands
for
as
they
pointed
out
england
is
the
only
refuge
in
which
an
anarchist
is
safe
until
some
particular
crime
can
be
imputed
to
him
and
what
is
more
proven
up
to
the
hilt
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
visit
of
the
king
to
paris
passed
off
without
incident
as
did
the
return
visit
of
the
president
to
london
on
the
surface
all
was
peace
and
goodwill
but
under
the
surface
seethed
plot
and
counterplot
and
behind
the
scenes
two
great
governments
were
extremely
anxious
and
high
officials
in
the
secret
service
spent
sleepless
nights
as
no
incident
had
happened
the
vigilance
of
the
authorities
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
relaxed
at
the
very
moment
when
if
they
had
known
their
adversaries
it
should
have
been
redoubled
always
beware
of
the
anarchist
when
he
has
been
good
look
out
for
the
reaction
it
annoys
him
to
be
compelled
to
remain
quiet
when
there
is
a
grand
opportunity
for
strutting
across
the
world
stage
and
when
he
misses
the
psychological
moment
he
is
apt
to
turn
as
the
english
say
when
it
first
became
known
that
there
was
to
be
a
royal
procession
through
the
streets
of
paris
a
few
fanatical
both
in
that
city
and
in
london
wished
to
take
action
but
they
were
overruled
by
the
saner
members
of
the
organisation
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
anarchists
are
a
band
of
lunatics
there
are
able
brains
among
them
and
these
born
leaders
as
naturally
assume
control
in
the
underground
world
of
anarchy
as
would
have
been
the
case
if
they
had
devoted
their
talents
to
affairs
in
ordinary
life
they
were
men
whose
minds
at
one
period
had
taken
the
wrong
turning
these
people
although
they
calmed
the
frenzy
of
the
extremists
nevertheless
regarded
the
possible
between
england
and
france
with
grave
apprehension
if
france
and
england
became
as
friendly
as
france
and
russia
might
not
the
refuge
which
england
had
given
to
anarchy
become
a
thing
of
the
past
i
may
say
here
that
my
own
weight
as
an
anarchist
while
attending
these
meetings
in
disguise
under
the
name
of
paul
ducharme
was
invariably
thrown
in
to
help
the
cause
of
moderation
my
rôle
of
course
was
not
to
talk
too
much
not
to
make
myself
prominent
yet
in
such
a
gathering
a
man
can
not
remain
wholly
a
spectator
care
for
my
own
safety
led
me
to
be
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
for
members
of
communities
banded
together
against
the
laws
of
the
land
in
which
they
live
are
extremely
suspicious
of
one
another
and
an
inadvertent
word
may
cause
disaster
to
the
person
speaking
it
perhaps
it
was
this
conservatism
on
my
part
that
caused
my
advice
to
be
sought
after
by
the
inner
circle
what
you
might
term
the
governing
body
of
the
anarchists
for
strange
as
it
may
appear
this
organisation
sworn
to
put
down
all
law
and
order
was
itself
most
rigidly
governed
with
a
russian
prince
elected
as
its
chairman
a
man
of
striking
ability
who
nevertheless
i
believe
owed
his
election
more
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
nobleman
than
to
the
recognition
of
his
intrinsic
worth
and
another
point
which
interested
me
much
was
that
this
prince
ruled
his
obstreperous
subjects
after
the
fashion
of
russian
despotism
rather
than
according
to
the
liberal
ideas
of
the
country
in
which
he
was
domiciled
i
have
known
him
more
than
once
ruthlessly
overturn
the
action
of
the
majority
stamp
his
foot
smite
his
huge
fist
on
the
table
and
declare
so
and
so
should
not
be
done
no
matter
what
the
vote
was
and
the
thing
was
not
done
either
at
the
more
recent
period
of
which
i
speak
the
chairmanship
of
the
london
anarchists
was
held
by
a
weak
vacillating
man
and
the
mob
had
got
somewhat
out
of
hand
in
the
crisis
that
confronted
us
i
yearned
for
the
firm
fist
and
dominant
boot
of
the
uncompromising
russian
i
spoke
only
once
during
this
time
and
assured
my
listeners
that
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
coming
friendship
of
the
two
nations
i
said
the
englishman
was
so
wedded
to
his
grotesque
ideas
regarding
the
liberty
of
the
subject
he
so
worshipped
absolute
legal
evidence
that
we
would
never
find
our
comrades
disappear
mysteriously
from
england
as
had
been
the
case
in
continental
countries
although
restless
during
the
exchange
of
visits
between
king
and
president
i
believe
i
could
have
carried
the
english
phalanx
with
me
if
the
international
courtesies
had
ended
there
but
after
it
was
announced
that
members
of
the
british
parliament
were
to
meet
the
members
of
the
french
legislature
the
paris
circle
became
alarmed
and
when
that
conference
did
not
end
the
but
merely
paved
the
way
for
a
meeting
of
business
men
belonging
to
the
two
countries
in
paris
the
french
anarchists
sent
a
delegate
over
to
us
who
made
a
wild
speech
one
night
waving
continually
the
red
flag
this
aroused
all
our
own
malcontents
to
a
frenzy
the
french
speaker
practically
charged
the
english
contingent
with
cowardice
said
that
as
they
were
safe
from
molestation
they
felt
no
sympathy
for
their
comrades
in
paris
at
any
time
liable
to
summary
arrest
and
the
torture
of
the
secret
this
must
be
wafted
to
the
heavens
in
a
halo
of
dynamite
the
paris
anarchists
were
determined
and
although
they
wished
the
of
their
london
brethren
yet
if
the
speaker
did
not
bring
back
with
him
assurance
of
such
paris
would
act
on
its
own
initiative
the
russian
despot
would
have
made
short
work
of
this
rhetoric
but
alas
he
was
absent
and
an
overwhelming
vote
in
favour
of
force
was
carried
and
accepted
by
the
trembling
chairman
my
french
took
back
with
him
to
paris
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
english
comrades
to
whom
he
had
appealed
all
that
was
asked
of
the
english
contingent
was
that
it
should
arrange
for
the
escape
and
safe
keeping
of
the
assassin
who
flung
the
bomb
into
the
midst
of
the
english
visitors
and
after
the
oratorical
madman
had
departed
i
to
my
horror
was
chosen
to
arrange
for
the
safe
transport
and
future
custody
of
the
it
is
not
etiquette
in
anarchist
circles
for
any
member
to
decline
whatever
task
is
given
him
by
the
vote
of
his
comrades
he
knows
the
alternative
which
is
suicide
if
he
declines
the
task
and
still
remains
upon
earth
the
dilemma
is
solved
for
him
as
the
italian
felini
solved
it
through
the
back
of
my
unfortunate
helper
brisson
i
therefore
accepted
the
unwelcome
office
in
silence
and
received
from
the
treasurer
the
money
necessary
for
carrying
out
the
same
i
realised
for
the
first
time
since
joining
the
anarchist
association
years
before
that
i
was
in
genuine
danger
a
single
false
step
a
single
inadvertent
word
might
close
the
career
of
eugène
valmont
and
at
the
same
moment
terminate
the
existence
of
the
quiet
inoffensive
paul
ducharme
teacher
of
the
french
language
i
knew
perfectly
well
i
should
be
followed
the
moment
i
received
the
money
the
french
delegate
asked
when
they
were
to
expect
me
in
paris
he
wished
to
know
so
that
all
the
resources
of
their
organisation
might
be
placed
at
my
disposal
i
replied
calmly
enough
that
i
could
not
state
definitely
on
what
day
i
should
leave
england
there
was
plenty
of
time
as
the
business
men
representatives
from
london
would
not
reach
paris
for
another
two
weeks
i
was
well
known
to
the
majority
of
the
paris
organisation
and
would
present
myself
before
them
on
the
first
night
of
my
arrival
the
paris
delegate
exhibited
all
the
energy
of
a
new
recruit
and
he
seemed
dissatisfied
with
my
vagueness
but
i
went
on
without
heeding
his
displeasure
he
was
not
personally
known
to
me
nor
i
to
him
but
if
i
may
say
so
paul
ducharme
was
well
thought
of
by
all
the
rest
of
those
present
i
had
learned
a
great
lesson
during
the
episode
of
the
necklace
which
resulted
in
my
dismissal
by
the
french
government
i
had
learned
that
if
you
expect
pursuit
it
is
always
well
to
leave
a
clue
for
the
pursuer
to
follow
therefore
i
continued
in
a
low
conversational
tone
shall
want
the
whole
of
tomorrow
for
myself
i
must
notify
my
pupils
of
my
absence
even
if
my
pupils
leave
me
it
will
not
so
much
matter
i
can
probably
get
others
but
what
does
matter
is
my
secretarial
work
with
monsieur
valmont
of
the
imperial
flats
i
am
just
finishing
for
him
the
translation
of
a
volume
from
french
into
english
and
tomorrow
i
can
complete
the
work
and
get
his
permission
to
leave
for
a
fortnight
this
man
who
is
a
compatriot
of
my
own
has
given
me
employment
ever
since
i
came
to
london
from
him
i
have
received
the
bulk
of
my
income
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
patronage
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
i
not
only
have
no
desire
to
offend
him
but
i
wish
the
secretarial
work
to
continue
when
i
return
to
london
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
at
this
it
was
generally
recognised
that
a
man
living
should
not
be
interfered
with
if
possible
anarchists
are
not
individuals
as
most
people
think
for
many
of
them
hold
excellent
situations
some
occupying
positions
of
great
trust
which
is
rarely
betrayed
it
is
recognised
that
a
man
duty
not
only
to
himself
but
to
the
organisation
is
to
make
all
the
money
he
can
and
thus
not
be
liable
to
fall
back
on
the
relief
fund
this
frank
admission
of
my
dependence
on
valmont
made
it
all
the
more
impossible
that
anyone
there
listening
should
suspect
that
it
was
valmont
himself
who
was
addressing
the
conclave
will
then
take
the
night
train
tomorrow
for
paris
persisted
the
inquisitive
french
delegate
and
no
i
shall
take
the
night
train
and
it
shall
be
for
paris
but
not
from
charing
cross
victoria
or
waterloo
i
shall
travel
on
the
continental
express
from
liverpool
street
to
harwich
cross
to
the
hook
of
holland
and
from
there
make
my
way
to
paris
through
holland
and
belgium
i
wish
to
investigate
that
route
as
a
possible
path
for
our
comrade
to
escape
after
the
blow
is
struck
calais
boulogne
dieppe
and
havre
will
be
closely
watched
i
shall
perhaps
bring
him
to
london
by
way
of
antwerp
and
the
hook
these
amiable
disclosures
were
so
fully
in
keeping
with
paul
ducharme
reputation
for
candour
and
caution
that
i
saw
they
made
an
excellent
impression
on
my
audience
and
here
the
chairman
intervened
putting
an
end
to
further
by
saying
they
all
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
judgment
of
monsieur
paul
ducharme
and
the
paris
delegate
might
advise
his
friends
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
london
representative
within
the
next
three
or
four
days
i
left
the
meeting
and
went
directly
to
my
room
in
soho
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
observe
whether
i
was
watched
or
not
there
i
stayed
all
night
and
in
the
morning
quitted
soho
as
ducharme
with
a
gray
beard
and
bowed
shoulders
walked
west
to
the
imperial
flats
took
the
lift
to
the
top
and
seeing
the
corridor
was
clear
let
myself
in
to
my
own
flat
i
departed
from
my
flat
promptly
at
six
again
as
paul
ducharme
carrying
this
time
a
bundle
done
up
in
brown
paper
under
my
arm
and
proceeded
directly
to
my
room
in
soho
later
i
took
a
bus
still
carrying
my
brown
paper
parcel
and
reached
liverpool
street
in
ample
time
for
the
continental
train
by
a
little
private
arrangement
with
the
guard
i
secured
a
compartment
for
myself
although
up
to
the
moment
the
train
left
the
station
i
could
not
be
sure
but
that
i
might
be
compelled
to
take
the
trip
to
the
hook
of
holland
after
all
if
any
one
had
insisted
on
coming
into
my
compartment
i
should
have
crossed
the
north
sea
that
night
i
knew
i
should
be
followed
from
soho
to
the
station
and
that
probably
the
spy
would
go
as
far
as
harwich
and
see
me
on
the
boat
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
cross
i
had
chosen
this
route
for
the
reason
that
we
have
no
organisation
in
holland
the
nearest
circle
is
in
brussels
and
if
there
had
been
time
the
brussels
circle
would
have
been
warned
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
there
was
however
no
time
for
a
letter
and
anarchists
never
use
the
telegraph
especially
so
far
as
the
continent
is
concerned
unless
in
cases
of
the
greatest
emergency
if
they
telegraphed
my
description
to
brussels
the
chances
were
it
would
not
be
an
anarchist
who
watched
my
landing
but
a
member
of
the
belgian
police
force
the
continental
express
does
not
stop
between
liverpool
street
and
parkeston
quay
which
it
is
timed
to
reach
three
minutes
before
ten
this
gave
me
an
hour
and
a
half
in
which
to
change
my
apparel
the
garments
of
the
poor
old
professor
i
rolled
up
into
a
ball
one
by
one
and
flung
out
through
the
open
window
far
into
the
marsh
past
which
we
were
flying
in
a
pitch
dark
night
coat
trousers
and
waistcoat
rested
in
separate
swamps
at
least
ten
miles
apart
gray
whiskers
and
gray
wig
i
tore
into
little
pieces
and
dropped
the
bits
out
of
the
open
window
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
secure
a
compartment
in
the
front
of
the
train
and
when
it
came
to
rest
at
parkeston
quay
station
the
crowd
eager
for
the
steamer
rushed
past
me
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
midst
of
it
a
dapper
young
man
with
black
beard
and
moustaches
my
own
closely
cropped
black
hair
covered
by
a
new
bowler
hat
anyone
looking
for
paul
ducharme
would
have
paid
small
attention
to
me
and
to
any
friend
of
valmont
i
was
equally
unrecognisable
i
strolled
in
leisurely
manner
to
the
great
eastern
hotel
on
the
quay
and
asked
the
clerk
if
a
portmanteau
addressed
to
john
wilkins
had
arrived
that
day
from
london
he
said
whereupon
i
secured
a
room
for
the
night
as
the
last
train
had
already
left
for
the
metropolis
next
morning
john
wilkins
accompanied
by
a
brand
new
and
rather
expensive
portmanteau
took
the
train
for
liverpool
street
where
he
arrived
at
ten
stepped
into
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
savoy
restaurant
lunching
there
with
the
portmanteau
deposited
in
the
cloak
room
when
john
wilkins
had
finished
an
excellent
lunch
in
a
leisurely
manner
at
the
café
parisien
of
the
savoy
and
had
paid
his
bill
he
did
not
go
out
into
the
strand
over
the
court
by
which
he
had
entered
but
went
through
the
hotel
and
down
the
stairs
and
so
out
into
the
thoroughfare
facing
the
embankment
then
turning
to
his
right
he
reached
the
embankment
entrance
of
the
hotel
cecil
this
leads
into
a
long
dark
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
the
lift
may
be
rung
for
it
does
not
come
lower
than
the
floor
above
unless
specially
summoned
in
this
dark
corridor
which
was
empty
john
wilkins
took
off
the
black
beard
and
moustache
hid
it
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
there
went
up
into
the
lift
a
few
moments
later
to
the
office
floor
i
eugène
valmont
myself
for
the
first
time
in
several
days
even
then
i
did
not
take
a
cab
to
my
flat
but
passed
under
the
arched
strand
front
of
the
in
a
cab
bound
for
the
residence
of
that
nobleman
who
had
formerly
engaged
me
to
see
after
the
safety
of
the
king
you
will
say
that
this
was
all
very
elaborate
precaution
to
take
when
a
man
was
not
even
sure
he
was
followed
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
whether
anyone
watched
me
or
not
nor
do
i
care
i
live
in
the
present
when
once
the
past
is
done
with
it
ceases
to
exist
for
me
it
is
quite
possible
nay
entirely
probable
that
no
one
tracked
me
farther
than
liverpool
street
station
the
night
before
yet
it
was
for
lack
of
such
precaution
that
my
assistant
brisson
received
the
italian
dagger
under
his
shoulder
blade
fifteen
years
before
the
present
moment
is
ever
the
critical
time
the
future
is
merely
for
intelligent
forethought
it
was
to
prepare
for
the
future
that
i
was
now
in
a
cab
on
the
way
to
my
lord
residence
it
was
not
the
french
anarchists
i
feared
during
the
contest
in
which
i
was
about
to
become
engaged
but
the
paris
police
i
knew
french
officialdom
too
well
not
to
understand
the
futility
of
going
to
the
authorities
there
and
proclaiming
my
object
if
i
ventured
to
approach
the
chief
of
police
with
the
information
that
i
in
london
had
discovered
what
it
was
his
business
in
paris
to
know
my
reception
would
be
far
from
cordial
even
though
or
rather
because
i
announced
myself
as
eugène
valmont
the
exploits
of
eugène
had
become
part
of
the
legends
of
paris
and
these
legends
were
extremely
distasteful
to
those
men
in
power
my
doings
have
frequently
been
made
the
subject
of
feuilletons
in
the
columns
of
the
paris
press
and
were
of
course
exaggerated
by
the
imagination
of
the
writers
yet
nevertheless
i
admit
i
did
some
good
strokes
of
detection
during
my
service
with
the
french
government
it
is
but
natural
then
that
the
present
authorities
should
listen
with
some
impatience
when
the
name
of
eugène
valmont
is
mentioned
i
recognise
this
as
quite
in
the
order
of
things
to
be
expected
and
am
honest
enough
to
confess
that
in
my
own
time
i
often
hearkened
to
narratives
regarding
the
performances
of
lecocq
with
a
doubting
shrug
of
the
shoulders
now
if
the
french
police
knew
anything
of
this
anarchist
plot
which
was
quite
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
and
if
i
were
in
surreptitious
communication
with
the
anarchists
more
especially
with
the
man
who
was
to
fling
the
bomb
there
was
every
chance
i
might
find
myself
in
the
grip
of
french
justice
i
must
then
provide
myself
with
credentials
to
show
that
i
was
acting
not
against
the
peace
and
quiet
of
my
country
but
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
i
therefore
wished
to
get
from
the
nobleman
a
commission
in
writing
similar
to
that
command
which
he
had
placed
upon
me
during
the
king
visit
this
commission
i
should
lodge
at
my
bank
in
paris
to
be
a
voucher
for
me
at
the
last
extremity
i
had
no
doubt
his
lordship
would
empower
me
to
act
in
this
instance
as
i
had
acted
on
two
former
occasions
perhaps
if
i
had
not
lunched
so
well
i
might
have
approached
his
lordship
with
greater
deference
than
was
the
case
but
when
ordering
lunch
i
permitted
a
bottle
of
château
du
tertre
a
most
delicious
claret
to
be
decanted
carefully
for
my
delectation
at
the
table
and
this
caused
a
genial
glow
to
permeate
throughout
my
system
inducing
a
mental
optimism
which
left
me
ready
to
salute
the
greatest
of
earth
on
a
plane
of
absolute
equality
besides
after
all
i
am
the
citizen
of
a
republic
the
nobleman
received
me
with
frigid
correctness
implying
disapproval
of
my
unauthorised
visit
rather
than
expressing
it
our
interview
was
extremely
brief
had
the
felicity
of
serving
your
lordship
upon
two
occasions
i
began
are
well
within
my
recollection
he
interrupted
i
do
not
remember
sending
for
you
a
third
time
have
taken
the
liberty
of
coming
unrequested
my
lord
because
of
the
importance
of
the
news
i
carry
i
surmise
that
you
are
interested
in
the
promotion
of
friendship
between
france
and
england
surmise
sir
is
incorrect
i
care
not
a
button
about
it
my
only
anxiety
was
for
the
safety
of
the
king
even
the
superb
claret
was
not
enough
to
fortify
me
against
words
so
harsh
and
tones
so
discourteous
as
those
his
lordship
permitted
himself
to
use
said
i
dropping
the
title
in
my
rising
anger
may
interest
you
to
know
that
a
number
of
your
countrymen
run
the
risk
of
being
blown
to
eternity
by
an
anarchist
bomb
in
less
than
two
weeks
from
today
a
party
of
business
men
true
representatives
of
a
class
to
which
the
of
your
empire
is
due
are
about
to
proceed
spare
me
interpolated
his
lordship
wearily
have
read
that
sort
of
thing
so
often
in
the
newspapers
if
all
these
estimable
city
men
are
blown
up
the
empire
would
doubtless
miss
them
as
you
hint
but
i
should
not
and
their
fate
does
not
interest
me
in
the
least
although
you
did
me
the
credit
of
believing
that
it
would
thompson
you
will
show
this
person
out
sir
if
i
desire
your
presence
here
in
future
i
will
send
for
you
may
send
for
the
devil
i
cried
now
thoroughly
enraged
the
wine
getting
the
better
of
me
express
my
meaning
more
tersely
than
i
cared
to
do
he
replied
coldly
and
that
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
him
entering
the
cab
i
now
drove
to
my
flat
indignant
at
the
reception
i
had
met
with
however
i
knew
the
english
people
too
well
to
malign
them
for
the
action
of
one
of
their
number
and
resentment
never
dwells
long
with
me
arriving
at
my
rooms
i
looked
through
the
newspapers
to
learn
all
i
could
of
the
proposed
business
excursion
to
paris
and
in
reading
the
names
of
those
most
prominent
in
carrying
out
the
necessary
arrangements
i
came
across
that
of
raymond
white
which
caused
me
to
sit
back
in
my
chair
and
wrinkle
my
brow
in
an
endeavour
to
stir
my
memory
unless
i
was
much
mistaken
i
had
been
so
happy
as
to
oblige
this
gentleman
some
dozen
or
thirteen
years
before
as
i
remembered
him
he
was
a
business
man
who
engaged
in
large
transactions
with
france
dealing
especially
in
lyons
and
that
district
his
address
was
given
in
the
newspaper
as
old
change
so
at
once
i
resolved
to
see
him
although
i
could
not
recall
the
details
of
our
previous
meeting
if
indeed
he
should
turn
out
to
be
the
same
person
yet
the
mere
sight
of
the
name
had
produced
a
mental
pleasure
as
a
chance
chord
struck
may
bring
a
grateful
harmony
to
the
mind
i
determined
to
get
my
credentials
from
white
if
possible
for
his
recommendation
would
in
truth
be
much
more
valuable
than
that
of
the
gruff
old
nobleman
to
whom
i
had
first
applied
because
if
i
got
into
trouble
with
the
police
of
paris
i
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
natural
politeness
of
the
authorities
to
know
that
a
letter
from
one
of
the
city
guests
would
secure
my
instant
release
i
took
a
hansom
to
the
head
of
that
narrow
thoroughfare
known
as
old
change
and
there
dismissed
my
cab
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
recognise
white
coming
out
of
his
office
a
moment
later
and
i
should
have
missed
him
white
i
accosted
him
desire
to
enjoy
both
the
pleasure
and
the
honour
of
introducing
myself
to
you
replied
white
with
a
smile
introduction
is
not
necessary
and
the
pleasure
and
honour
are
mine
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
this
is
monsieur
valmont
of
paris
of
paris
i
corrected
you
no
longer
in
government
service
then
a
little
more
than
ten
years
i
have
been
a
resident
of
london
and
have
never
let
me
know
that
is
something
the
diplomatists
call
an
unfriendly
act
monsieur
now
shall
we
return
to
my
office
or
go
to
a
café
your
office
if
you
please
white
i
come
on
rather
important
business
entering
his
private
office
the
merchant
closed
the
door
offered
me
a
chair
and
sat
down
himself
by
his
desk
from
the
first
he
had
addressed
me
in
french
which
he
spoke
with
an
accent
so
pure
that
it
did
my
lonesome
heart
good
to
hear
it
called
upon
you
half
a
dozen
years
ago
he
went
on
i
was
over
in
paris
on
a
festive
occasion
where
i
hoped
to
secure
your
company
but
i
could
not
learn
definitely
whether
you
were
still
with
the
government
or
not
is
the
way
of
the
french
officialism
i
replied
they
knew
my
whereabouts
they
would
keep
the
knowledge
to
themselves
if
you
have
been
ten
years
in
london
monsieur
valmont
we
may
now
perhaps
have
the
pleasure
of
claiming
you
as
an
englishman
so
i
beg
you
will
accompany
us
on
another
festive
occasion
to
paris
next
week
perhaps
you
have
seen
that
a
number
of
us
are
going
over
there
to
make
the
welkin
ring
i
have
read
all
about
the
business
men
excursion
to
paris
and
it
is
with
reference
to
this
journey
that
i
wish
to
consult
you
and
here
i
gave
white
in
detail
the
plot
of
the
anarchists
against
the
growing
cordiality
of
the
two
countries
the
merchant
listened
quietly
without
interruption
until
i
had
finished
then
he
said
suppose
it
will
be
rather
useless
to
inform
the
police
of
paris
white
it
is
the
police
of
paris
i
fear
more
than
the
anarchists
they
would
resent
information
coming
to
them
from
the
outside
especially
from
an
the
inference
being
that
they
were
not
up
to
their
own
duties
friction
and
delay
would
ensue
until
the
deed
was
inevitable
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
the
police
of
paris
may
have
some
inkling
of
the
plot
and
in
that
case
just
before
the
event
they
are
reasonably
certain
to
arrest
the
wrong
men
i
shall
be
moving
about
paris
not
as
eugène
valmont
but
as
paul
ducharme
the
anarchist
therefore
there
is
some
danger
that
as
a
stranger
and
a
suspect
i
may
be
laid
by
the
heels
at
the
critical
moment
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
furnish
me
with
credentials
which
i
can
deposit
somewhere
in
paris
in
case
of
need
i
may
thus
be
able
to
convince
the
authorities
that
they
have
taken
the
wrong
man
white
entirely
unperturbed
by
the
prospect
of
having
a
bomb
thrown
at
him
within
two
weeks
calmly
wrote
several
documents
then
turned
his
untroubled
face
to
me
and
said
in
a
very
confidential
winning
tone
valmont
you
have
stated
the
case
with
that
clear
comprehensiveness
pertaining
to
a
nation
which
understands
the
meaning
of
words
and
the
correct
adjustment
of
them
that
felicity
of
language
which
has
given
france
the
first
place
in
the
literature
of
nations
consequently
i
think
i
see
very
clearly
the
delicacies
of
the
situation
we
may
expect
hindrances
rather
than
help
from
officials
on
either
side
of
the
channel
secrecy
is
essential
to
success
have
you
spoken
of
this
to
anyone
but
me
to
lord
blank
i
replied
now
i
deeply
regret
having
made
a
confidant
of
him
does
not
in
the
least
matter
said
white
with
a
smile
blank
mind
is
entirely
occupied
by
his
own
greatness
chemists
tell
me
that
you
can
not
add
a
new
ingredient
to
a
saturated
solution
therefore
your
revelation
will
have
made
no
impression
upon
his
lordship
intellect
he
has
already
forgotten
all
about
it
am
i
right
in
supposing
that
everything
hinges
on
the
man
who
is
to
throw
the
bomb
right
sir
he
may
be
venal
he
may
be
traitorous
he
may
be
a
coward
he
may
be
revengeful
he
may
be
a
drunkard
before
i
am
in
conversation
with
him
for
ten
minutes
i
shall
know
what
his
weak
spot
is
it
is
upon
that
spot
i
must
act
and
my
action
must
be
delayed
till
the
very
last
moment
for
if
he
disappears
too
long
before
the
event
his
first
second
or
third
substitute
will
instantly
step
into
his
place
so
you
can
not
complete
your
plans
until
you
have
met
this
man
i
propose
continued
white
we
take
no
one
into
our
confidence
in
a
case
like
this
there
is
little
use
in
going
before
a
committee
i
can
see
that
you
do
not
need
any
advice
and
my
own
part
shall
be
to
remain
in
the
background
content
to
support
the
most
competent
man
that
could
have
been
chosen
to
grapple
with
a
very
difficult
crisis
i
bowed
profoundly
there
was
a
compliment
in
his
glance
as
well
as
in
his
words
never
before
had
i
met
so
charming
a
man
he
continued
handing
me
one
of
the
papers
he
had
written
a
letter
to
whom
it
may
concern
appointing
you
my
agent
for
the
next
three
weeks
and
holding
myself
responsible
for
all
you
see
fit
to
do
here
he
went
on
passing
to
me
a
second
sheet
a
letter
of
introduction
to
monsieur
largent
the
manager
of
my
bank
in
paris
a
man
well
known
and
highly
respected
in
all
circles
both
official
and
commercial
i
suggest
that
you
introduce
yourself
to
him
and
he
will
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
respond
to
any
call
you
may
make
night
or
day
i
assure
you
that
his
mere
presence
before
the
authorities
will
at
once
remove
any
ordinary
difficulty
and
now
he
added
taking
in
hand
the
third
slip
of
paper
speaking
with
some
hesitation
and
choosing
his
words
with
care
come
to
a
point
which
can
not
be
ignored
money
is
a
magician
wand
which
like
faith
will
remove
mountains
it
may
also
remove
an
anarchist
hovering
about
the
route
of
a
business
man
procession
he
now
handed
to
me
what
i
saw
was
a
draft
on
paris
for
a
thousand
pounds
assure
you
monsieur
i
protested
covered
with
confusion
no
thought
of
money
was
in
my
mind
when
i
took
the
liberty
of
presenting
myself
to
you
i
have
already
received
more
than
i
could
have
expected
in
the
generous
confidence
you
were
good
enough
to
repose
in
me
as
exhibited
by
these
credentials
and
especially
the
letter
to
your
banker
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
your
countrymen
mr
white
of
which
you
are
a
most
notable
example
i
am
in
no
need
of
money
valmont
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
you
have
got
on
well
amongst
us
this
money
is
for
two
purposes
first
you
will
use
what
you
need
i
know
paris
very
well
monsieur
and
have
never
found
gold
an
embarrassment
there
the
second
purpose
is
this
i
suggest
that
when
you
present
the
letter
of
introduction
to
monsieur
largent
you
will
casually
place
this
amount
to
your
account
in
his
bank
he
will
thus
see
that
besides
writing
you
a
letter
of
introduction
i
transfer
a
certain
amount
of
my
own
balance
to
your
credit
that
will
do
you
no
harm
with
him
i
assure
you
and
now
monsieur
valmont
it
only
remains
for
me
to
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
you
have
given
me
and
to
assure
you
that
i
shall
march
from
the
gare
du
nord
without
a
tremor
knowing
the
outcome
is
in
such
capable
custody
and
then
this
estimable
man
shook
hands
with
me
in
action
the
most
cordial
i
walked
away
from
old
change
as
if
i
trod
upon
air
a
feeling
vastly
different
from
that
with
which
i
departed
from
the
residence
of
the
old
nobleman
in
the
west
end
but
a
few
hours
before
next
morning
i
was
in
paris
and
next
night
i
attended
the
underground
meeting
of
the
anarchists
held
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
luxembourg
i
was
known
to
many
there
assembled
but
my
acquaintance
of
course
was
not
so
large
as
with
the
london
circle
they
had
half
expected
me
the
night
before
knowing
that
even
going
by
the
hook
of
holland
i
might
have
reached
paris
in
time
for
the
conclave
i
was
introduced
generally
to
the
assemblage
as
the
emissary
from
england
who
was
to
assist
the
brother
to
escape
either
to
that
country
or
to
such
other
point
of
safety
as
i
might
choose
no
questions
were
asked
me
regarding
my
doings
of
the
day
before
nor
was
i
required
to
divulge
the
plans
for
my
escape
i
was
responsible
that
was
enough
if
i
failed
through
no
fault
of
my
own
it
was
but
part
of
the
we
were
all
prepared
to
face
if
i
failed
through
treachery
then
a
dagger
in
the
back
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
we
all
knew
the
conditions
of
our
sinister
contract
and
we
all
recognised
that
the
least
said
the
better
the
cellar
was
dimly
lighted
by
one
oil
lamp
depending
from
the
ceiling
from
this
hung
a
cord
attached
to
an
extinguisher
and
one
jerk
of
the
cord
would
put
out
the
light
then
while
the
main
entry
doors
were
being
battered
down
by
police
the
occupants
of
the
room
escaped
through
one
of
three
or
four
human
provided
for
that
purpose
if
any
parisian
anarchist
does
me
the
honour
to
read
these
jottings
i
beg
to
inform
him
that
while
i
remained
in
office
under
the
government
of
france
there
was
never
a
time
when
i
did
not
know
the
exit
of
each
of
these
underground
passages
and
could
during
any
night
there
was
conference
have
bagged
the
whole
lot
of
those
there
assembled
it
was
never
my
purpose
however
to
shake
the
anarchists
confidence
in
their
system
for
that
merely
meant
the
removal
of
the
gathering
to
another
spot
thus
giving
us
the
additional
trouble
of
mapping
out
their
new
exits
and
entrances
when
i
did
make
a
raid
on
anarchist
headquarters
in
paris
it
was
always
to
secure
some
particular
man
i
had
my
emissaries
in
plain
clothes
stationed
at
each
exit
in
any
case
the
rats
were
allowed
to
escape
unmolested
sneaking
forth
with
great
caution
into
the
night
but
we
always
spotted
the
man
we
wanted
and
almost
invariably
arrested
him
elsewhere
having
followed
him
from
his
kennel
in
each
case
my
uniformed
officers
found
a
dark
and
empty
cellar
and
retired
apparently
baffled
but
the
coincidence
that
on
the
night
of
every
raid
some
member
there
present
was
secretly
arrested
in
another
quarter
of
paris
and
perhaps
given
a
free
passage
to
russia
never
seemed
to
awaken
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
the
conspirators
i
think
the
london
anarchists
method
is
much
better
and
i
have
ever
considered
the
english
nihilist
the
most
dangerous
of
this
fraternity
for
he
is
and
not
carried
away
by
his
own
enthusiasm
and
consequently
rarely
carried
away
by
his
own
police
the
authorities
of
london
meet
no
opposition
in
making
a
raid
they
find
a
room
containing
a
more
or
less
shabby
coterie
playing
cards
at
cheap
pine
tables
there
is
no
money
visible
and
indeed
very
little
coin
would
be
brought
to
light
if
the
whole
party
were
searched
so
the
police
are
unable
to
convict
the
players
under
the
gambling
act
besides
it
is
difficult
in
any
case
to
obtain
a
conviction
under
the
gambling
act
because
the
accused
has
the
sympathy
of
the
whole
country
with
him
it
has
always
been
to
me
one
of
the
anomalies
of
the
english
nature
that
a
magistrate
can
keep
a
straight
face
while
he
fines
some
poor
wretch
for
gambling
knowing
that
next
race
day
if
the
court
is
not
sitting
the
magistrate
himself
in
correct
sporting
costume
with
binoculars
hanging
at
his
hip
will
be
on
the
lawn
by
the
course
backing
his
favourite
horse
after
my
reception
at
the
anarchists
club
of
paris
i
remained
seated
unobtrusively
on
a
bench
waiting
until
routine
business
was
finished
after
which
i
expected
an
introduction
to
the
man
selected
to
throw
the
bomb
i
am
a
very
sensitive
person
and
sitting
there
quietly
i
became
aware
that
i
was
being
scrutinised
with
more
than
ordinary
intensity
by
someone
which
gave
me
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
at
last
in
the
opposite
me
i
saw
a
pair
of
eyes
as
luminous
as
those
of
a
tiger
peering
fixedly
at
me
i
returned
the
stare
with
such
composure
as
i
could
bring
to
my
aid
and
the
man
as
if
fascinated
by
a
look
as
steady
as
his
own
leaned
forward
and
came
more
and
more
into
the
circle
of
light
then
i
received
a
shock
which
it
required
my
utmost
to
conceal
the
face
haggard
and
drawn
was
none
other
than
that
of
adolph
simard
who
had
been
my
second
assistant
in
the
secret
service
of
france
during
my
last
year
in
office
he
was
a
most
capable
and
rising
young
man
at
that
time
and
of
course
he
knew
me
well
had
he
then
penetrated
my
disguise
such
an
event
seemed
impossible
he
could
not
have
recognised
my
voice
for
i
had
said
nothing
aloud
since
entering
the
room
my
few
words
to
the
president
being
spoken
in
a
whisper
simard
presence
there
bewildered
me
by
this
time
he
should
be
high
up
in
the
secret
service
if
he
were
now
a
spy
he
would
of
course
wish
to
familiarise
himself
with
every
particular
of
my
appearance
as
in
my
hands
lay
the
escape
of
the
criminal
yet
if
such
were
his
mission
why
did
he
attract
the
attention
of
all
members
by
this
scrutiny
that
he
recognised
me
as
valmont
i
had
not
the
least
fear
my
disguise
was
too
perfect
and
even
if
i
were
there
in
my
own
proper
person
i
had
not
seen
simard
nor
he
me
for
ten
years
and
great
changes
occur
in
a
man
appearance
during
so
long
a
period
yet
i
remembered
with
disquietude
that
white
recognised
me
and
here
tonight
i
had
recognised
simard
i
could
not
move
my
bench
farther
back
because
it
stood
already
against
the
wall
simard
on
the
contrary
was
seated
on
one
of
the
few
chairs
in
the
room
and
this
he
periodically
hitched
forward
the
better
to
continue
his
examination
which
now
attracted
the
notice
of
others
besides
myself
as
he
came
forward
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
completeness
of
his
disguise
so
far
as
apparel
was
concerned
he
was
a
perfect
picture
of
the
paris
wastrel
and
what
was
more
he
wore
on
his
head
a
cap
of
the
apaches
the
most
dangerous
band
of
that
have
ever
cursed
a
civilised
city
i
could
understand
that
even
among
lawless
anarchists
this
badge
of
membership
of
the
apache
band
might
well
strike
tenor
i
felt
that
before
the
meeting
adjourned
i
must
speak
with
him
and
i
determined
to
begin
our
conversation
by
asking
him
why
he
stared
so
fixedly
at
me
yet
even
then
i
should
have
made
little
progress
i
did
not
dare
to
hint
that
he
belonged
to
the
secret
service
nevertheless
if
the
authorities
had
this
plot
in
charge
it
was
absolutely
necessary
we
should
work
together
or
at
least
that
i
should
know
they
were
in
the
secret
and
steer
my
course
accordingly
the
fact
that
simard
appeared
with
undisguised
face
was
not
so
important
as
might
appear
to
an
outsider
it
is
always
safer
for
a
spy
to
preserve
his
natural
appearance
if
that
is
possible
because
a
false
beard
or
false
moustache
or
wig
run
the
risk
of
being
deranged
or
torn
away
as
i
have
said
an
anarchist
assemblage
is
simply
a
room
filled
with
the
atmosphere
of
suspicion
i
have
known
instances
where
an
innocent
stranger
was
suddenly
set
upon
in
the
midst
of
solemn
proceedings
by
two
or
three
impetuous
who
nearly
jerked
his
own
whiskers
from
his
face
under
the
impression
that
they
were
false
if
simard
therefore
appeared
in
his
own
scraggy
beard
and
unkempt
hair
it
meant
that
he
communicated
with
headquarters
by
some
circuitous
route
i
realised
therefore
that
a
very
touchy
bit
of
diplomacy
awaited
me
if
i
was
to
learn
from
himself
his
actual
status
while
i
pondered
over
this
perplexity
it
was
suddenly
dissolved
by
the
action
of
the
president
and
another
substituted
for
it
brother
simard
come
forward
asked
the
president
my
former
subordinate
removed
his
eyes
from
me
slowly
rose
from
his
chair
and
shuffled
up
to
the
president
table
ducharme
said
that
official
to
me
in
a
quiet
tone
introduce
you
to
brother
simard
whom
you
are
commissioned
to
see
into
a
place
of
safety
when
he
has
dispersed
the
procession
simard
turned
his
fishy
goggle
eyes
upon
me
and
a
grin
disclosed
teeth
he
held
out
his
hand
which
rising
to
my
feet
i
took
he
gave
me
a
flabby
grasp
and
all
the
time
his
inquiring
eyes
travelled
over
me
do
look
up
to
much
he
said
are
you
am
a
teacher
of
the
french
language
in
london
growled
simard
evidently
in
no
wise
prepossessed
by
my
appearance
thought
you
were
much
of
a
fighter
the
gendarmes
will
make
short
work
of
this
fellow
he
growled
to
the
chairman
ducharme
is
vouched
for
by
the
whole
english
circle
replied
the
president
firmly
the
english
i
think
very
little
of
them
still
it
matter
and
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
shuffled
to
his
seat
again
leaving
me
standing
there
in
a
very
embarrassed
state
of
mind
my
brain
in
a
whirl
that
the
man
was
present
with
his
own
face
was
bewildering
enough
but
that
he
should
be
here
under
his
own
name
was
simply
astounding
i
scarcely
heard
what
the
president
said
it
seemed
to
the
effect
that
simard
would
take
me
to
his
own
room
where
we
might
talk
over
our
plans
and
now
simard
rose
again
from
his
chair
and
said
to
the
president
that
if
nothing
more
were
wanted
of
him
we
should
go
accordingly
we
left
the
place
of
meeting
together
i
watched
my
comrade
narrowly
there
was
now
a
trembling
eagerness
in
his
action
and
without
a
word
he
hurried
me
to
the
nearest
café
where
we
sat
down
before
a
little
iron
table
on
the
pavement
he
shouted
harshly
me
four
absinthes
what
will
you
drink
ducharme
if
you
please
cried
simard
have
absinthe
then
he
cursed
the
waiter
for
his
slowness
when
the
absinthe
came
he
grasped
the
glass
and
swallowed
the
liquid
raw
a
thing
i
had
never
seen
done
before
into
the
next
measure
of
the
wormwood
he
poured
the
water
impetuously
from
the
carafe
another
thing
i
had
never
seen
done
before
and
dropped
two
lumps
of
sugar
into
it
over
the
third
glass
he
placed
a
flat
perforated
plated
spoon
piled
the
sugar
on
this
bridge
and
now
quite
expertly
allowed
the
water
to
drip
through
the
proper
way
of
concocting
this
seductive
mixture
finishing
his
second
glass
he
placed
the
perforated
spoon
over
the
fourth
and
began
now
more
calmly
sipping
the
third
while
the
water
dripped
slowly
into
the
last
glass
here
before
my
eyes
was
enacted
a
more
wonderful
change
than
the
gradual
transformation
of
transparent
absinthe
into
an
opaque
opalescent
liquid
simard
under
the
influence
of
the
drink
was
slowly
becoming
the
simard
i
had
known
ten
years
before
remarkable
absinthe
having
in
earlier
years
made
a
beast
of
the
man
was
now
forming
a
man
out
of
the
beast
his
staring
eyes
took
on
an
expression
of
human
comradeship
the
whole
mystery
became
perfectly
clear
to
me
without
a
question
asked
or
an
answer
uttered
this
man
was
no
spy
but
a
genuine
anarchist
however
it
happened
he
had
become
a
victim
of
absinthe
one
of
many
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
although
i
never
met
any
so
far
sunk
as
he
he
was
into
his
fourth
glass
and
had
ordered
two
more
when
he
began
to
speak
to
us
he
cried
with
something
like
a
civilised
smile
on
his
gaunt
face
not
offended
at
what
i
said
in
the
meeting
i
hope
no
i
answered
right
you
see
i
once
belonged
to
the
secret
service
and
if
my
chief
was
there
today
we
would
soon
find
ourselves
in
a
cool
dungeon
we
could
trip
up
eugène
valmont
at
these
words
spoken
with
sincerity
i
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
i
am
sure
such
an
expression
of
enjoyment
came
into
my
face
that
if
i
had
not
instantly
suppressed
it
i
might
have
betrayed
myself
was
eugène
valmont
i
asked
in
a
tone
of
assumed
indifference
mixing
his
fifth
glass
he
nodded
sagely
would
ask
that
question
if
you
been
in
paris
a
dozen
years
ago
he
was
the
government
chief
detective
and
he
knew
more
of
anarchists
yes
and
of
apaches
too
than
either
you
or
i
do
he
had
more
brains
in
his
little
finger
than
that
whole
lot
babbling
there
tonight
but
the
government
being
a
fool
as
all
governments
are
dismissed
him
and
because
i
was
his
assistant
they
dismissed
me
as
well
they
got
rid
of
all
his
staff
valmont
disappeared
if
i
could
have
found
him
i
would
be
sitting
here
with
you
tonight
but
he
was
right
to
disappear
the
government
did
all
they
could
against
us
who
had
been
his
friends
and
i
for
one
came
through
starvation
and
was
near
throwing
myself
in
the
seine
which
sometimes
i
wish
i
had
done
here
garçon
another
absinthe
but
i
came
to
like
the
gutter
and
here
i
am
i
rather
have
the
gutter
and
absinthe
than
the
luxembourg
without
it
i
had
my
revenge
on
the
government
many
times
since
for
i
knew
their
ways
and
often
have
i
circumvented
the
police
that
why
they
respect
me
among
the
anarchists
do
you
know
how
i
joined
i
knew
all
their
passwords
and
walked
right
into
one
of
their
meetings
alone
and
in
rags
here
am
i
i
said
adolph
simard
late
second
assistant
to
eugène
valmont
chief
detective
to
the
french
government
were
twenty
weapons
covering
me
at
once
but
i
laughed
i
starving
i
cried
and
i
want
something
to
eat
and
more
especially
something
to
drink
in
return
for
that
i
show
you
every
you
got
lift
the
president
chair
and
there
a
that
leads
to
the
rue
blanc
i
one
of
you
and
i
tell
you
the
tricks
of
the
police
was
my
initiation
and
from
that
moment
the
police
began
to
pick
their
spies
out
of
the
seine
and
now
they
leave
us
alone
even
valmont
himself
could
do
nothing
against
the
anarchists
since
i
have
joined
them
oh
the
incredible
of
human
nature
here
was
this
ruffian
proclaiming
the
limitations
of
valmont
who
half
an
hour
before
had
shaken
his
hand
within
the
innermost
circle
of
his
order
yet
my
heart
warmed
towards
the
wretch
who
had
remembered
me
and
my
exploits
it
now
became
my
anxious
and
difficult
task
to
lure
simard
away
from
this
café
and
its
absinthe
glass
after
glass
of
the
poison
had
brought
him
up
almost
to
his
former
intellectual
level
but
now
it
was
shoving
him
rapidly
down
the
hill
again
i
must
know
where
his
room
was
situated
yet
if
i
waited
much
longer
the
man
would
be
in
a
state
of
drunken
imbecility
which
would
not
only
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
guide
me
to
his
room
but
likely
cause
both
of
us
to
be
arrested
by
the
police
i
tried
persuasion
and
he
laughed
at
me
i
tried
threats
whereat
he
scowled
and
cursed
me
as
a
renegade
from
england
at
last
the
liquor
overpowered
him
and
his
head
sunk
on
the
metal
table
and
the
dark
blue
cap
fell
to
the
floor
i
was
in
despair
but
now
received
a
lesson
which
taught
me
that
if
a
man
leaves
a
city
even
for
a
short
time
he
falls
out
of
touch
with
its
ways
i
called
the
waiter
and
said
to
him
you
know
my
friend
here
do
not
know
his
name
replied
the
garçon
i
have
seen
him
many
times
at
this
café
he
is
usually
in
this
state
when
he
has
money
you
know
where
he
lives
he
promised
to
take
me
with
him
and
i
am
a
stranger
in
paris
no
discontent
monsieur
rest
tranquil
i
will
intervene
with
this
he
stepped
across
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
café
into
the
street
and
gave
utterance
to
a
low
peculiar
whistle
the
café
was
now
nearly
deserted
for
the
hour
was
very
late
or
rather
very
early
when
the
waiter
returned
i
whispered
to
him
in
some
anxiety
the
police
surely
no
he
cried
in
scorn
not
the
police
he
went
on
unconcernedly
taking
in
the
empty
chairs
and
tables
a
few
minutes
later
there
swaggered
up
to
the
café
two
of
the
most
disreputable
scoundrels
i
had
ever
seen
each
wearing
a
cap
with
a
glazed
peak
over
the
eyes
caps
exactly
similar
to
the
one
which
lay
in
front
of
simard
the
band
of
apaches
which
now
permeates
all
paris
has
risen
since
my
time
and
simard
had
been
mistaken
an
hour
before
in
asserting
that
valmont
was
familiar
with
their
haunts
the
present
chief
of
police
in
paris
and
some
of
his
predecessors
confess
there
is
a
difficulty
in
dealing
with
these
picked
assassins
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
however
that
is
not
to
be
therefore
the
apaches
increase
and
prosper
the
two
vagabonds
roughly
smote
simard
cap
on
his
prone
head
and
as
roughly
raised
him
to
his
feet
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
interposed
promised
to
take
me
home
with
him
follow
us
said
one
of
them
and
now
i
passed
through
the
morning
streets
of
paris
behind
three
yet
knew
that
i
was
safer
than
if
broad
daylight
was
in
the
thoroughfare
with
a
meridian
sun
shining
down
upon
us
i
was
doubly
safe
being
in
no
fear
of
harm
from
midnight
prowlers
and
equally
free
from
danger
of
arrest
by
the
police
every
officer
we
met
avoided
us
and
casually
stepped
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
we
turned
down
a
narrow
lane
then
through
a
still
narrower
one
which
terminated
at
a
courtyard
entering
a
tall
building
we
climbed
up
five
flights
of
stairs
to
a
landing
where
one
of
the
scouts
kicked
open
a
door
into
a
room
so
miserable
that
there
was
not
even
a
lock
to
protect
its
poverty
here
they
allowed
the
insensible
simard
to
drop
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
thus
they
left
us
alone
without
even
an
adieu
the
apaches
take
care
of
their
own
after
a
fashion
i
struck
a
match
and
found
part
of
a
bougie
stuck
in
the
mouth
of
an
absinthe
bottle
resting
on
a
rough
deal
table
lighting
the
bougie
i
surveyed
the
horrible
apartment
a
heap
of
rags
lay
in
a
corner
and
this
was
evidently
simard
bed
i
hauled
him
to
it
and
there
he
lay
unconscious
himself
a
bundle
of
rags
i
found
one
chair
or
rather
stool
for
it
had
no
back
i
drew
the
table
against
the
lockless
door
blew
out
the
light
sat
on
the
stool
resting
my
arms
on
the
table
and
my
head
on
my
arms
and
slept
peacefully
till
long
after
daybreak
simard
awoke
in
the
worst
possible
humour
he
poured
forth
a
great
variety
of
abusive
epithets
at
me
to
make
himself
still
more
agreeable
he
turned
back
the
rags
on
which
he
had
slept
and
brought
to
the
light
a
round
black
object
like
a
small
which
he
informed
me
was
the
picric
bomb
that
was
to
scatter
destruction
among
my
english
friends
for
whom
he
expressed
the
greatest
possible
loathing
and
contempt
then
sitting
up
he
began
playing
with
this
infernal
machine
knowing
as
well
as
i
that
if
he
allowed
it
to
drop
that
was
the
end
of
us
two
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
at
this
display
and
affected
a
nonchalance
i
was
far
from
feeling
but
finally
put
an
end
to
his
dangerous
amusement
by
telling
him
that
if
he
came
out
with
me
i
would
pay
for
his
breakfast
and
give
him
a
drink
of
absinthe
the
next
few
days
were
the
most
anxious
of
my
life
never
before
had
i
lived
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
a
picric
bomb
that
most
deadly
and
uncertain
of
all
explosive
agencies
i
speedily
found
that
simard
was
so
i
could
do
nothing
with
him
he
could
not
be
bribed
or
cajoled
or
persuaded
or
threatened
once
indeed
when
he
talked
with
drunken
affection
of
eugène
valmont
i
conceived
a
wild
notion
of
declaring
myself
to
him
but
a
moment
reflection
showed
the
absolute
uselessness
of
this
course
it
was
not
one
simard
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
but
half
a
dozen
or
more
there
was
simard
sober
half
sober
quarter
sober
drunk
half
drunk
quarter
drunk
or
wholly
drunk
any
bargain
i
might
make
with
the
one
simard
would
not
be
kept
by
any
of
the
other
six
the
only
safe
simard
was
simard
insensible
through
i
had
resolved
to
get
simard
insensibly
drunk
on
the
morning
of
the
procession
but
my
plans
were
upset
at
a
meeting
of
the
anarchists
which
luckily
took
place
on
an
evening
shortly
after
my
arrival
and
this
gave
me
time
to
mature
the
plan
which
was
actually
carried
out
each
member
of
the
anarchists
club
knew
of
slavery
to
absinthe
and
fears
were
expressed
that
he
might
prove
incapable
on
the
day
of
the
procession
too
late
for
a
substitute
to
take
his
place
it
was
therefore
proposed
that
one
or
two
others
should
be
stationed
along
the
route
of
the
procession
with
bombs
ready
if
simard
failed
this
i
strenuously
opposed
and
guaranteed
that
simard
would
be
ready
to
launch
his
missile
i
met
with
little
difficulty
in
persuading
the
company
to
agree
because
after
all
every
man
among
them
feared
he
might
be
one
of
those
selected
which
choice
was
practically
a
sentence
of
death
i
guaranteed
that
the
bomb
would
be
thrown
and
this
apparently
was
taken
to
mean
that
if
simard
did
not
do
the
deed
i
would
this
danger
over
i
next
took
the
measurements
and
estimated
the
weight
of
the
picric
bomb
i
then
sought
out
a
most
amiable
and
expert
pyrotechnist
a
capable
workman
of
genius
who
with
his
own
hand
makes
those
dramatic
firework
arrangements
which
you
sometimes
see
in
paris
as
eugène
valmont
i
had
rendered
a
great
service
to
this
man
and
he
was
not
likely
to
have
forgotten
it
during
one
of
the
anarchist
scares
a
stupid
policeman
had
arrested
him
and
when
i
intervened
the
man
was
just
on
the
verge
of
being
committed
for
life
france
trembled
in
one
of
her
panics
or
rather
paris
did
and
demanded
victims
this
blameless
little
workman
had
indeed
contributed
with
both
material
and
advice
but
any
fool
might
have
seen
that
he
had
done
this
innocently
his
assistance
had
been
invoked
and
secured
under
the
pretence
that
his
clients
were
promoting
an
amateur
firework
display
which
was
true
enough
but
the
display
cost
the
lives
of
three
men
and
intentionally
so
i
cheered
up
the
citizen
in
the
moment
of
his
utmost
despair
and
brought
such
proof
of
his
innocence
to
the
knowledge
of
those
above
me
that
he
was
most
reluctantly
acquitted
to
this
man
i
now
went
with
my
measurement
of
the
bomb
and
the
estimate
of
its
weight
said
i
you
remember
eugène
valmont
i
ever
likely
to
forget
him
he
replied
with
a
fervour
that
pleased
me
has
sent
me
to
you
and
implores
you
to
aid
me
and
that
aid
will
wipe
out
the
debt
you
owe
him
willingly
cried
the
artisan
long
as
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
anarchists
or
the
making
of
bombs
has
to
do
exactly
with
those
two
things
i
wish
you
to
make
an
innocent
bomb
which
will
prevent
an
anarchist
outrage
at
this
the
little
man
drew
back
and
his
face
became
pale
is
impossible
he
protested
have
had
enough
of
innocent
bombs
no
no
and
in
any
case
how
can
i
be
sure
you
come
from
eugène
valmont
no
monsieur
i
am
not
to
be
trapped
the
second
time
at
this
i
related
rapidly
all
that
valmont
had
done
for
him
and
even
repeated
valmont
most
intimate
conversation
with
him
the
man
was
nonplussed
but
remained
firm
dare
not
do
it
he
said
we
were
alone
in
his
back
shop
i
walked
to
the
door
and
thrust
in
the
bolt
then
after
a
moment
pause
turned
round
stretched
forth
my
right
hand
dramatically
and
cried
eugène
valmont
my
friend
staggered
against
the
wall
in
his
amazement
and
i
continued
in
solemn
tones
valmont
who
by
this
removal
of
his
disguise
places
his
life
in
your
hands
as
your
life
was
in
his
now
monsieur
what
will
you
do
he
replied
valmont
i
shall
do
whatever
you
ask
if
i
refused
a
moment
ago
it
was
because
i
thought
there
was
now
in
france
no
eugène
valmont
to
rectify
my
mistake
if
i
made
one
i
resumed
my
disguise
and
told
him
i
wished
an
innocent
substitute
for
this
picric
bomb
and
he
at
once
suggested
an
earthenware
globe
which
would
weigh
the
same
as
the
bomb
and
which
could
be
coloured
to
resemble
it
exactly
now
monsieur
valmont
do
you
wish
smoke
to
issue
from
this
imitation
bomb
i
said
such
quantity
as
you
can
compress
within
it
is
easily
done
he
cried
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
true
french
artist
may
i
place
within
some
little
design
of
my
own
which
will
astonish
your
friends
the
english
and
delight
my
friends
the
french
said
i
am
in
your
hands
i
trust
the
project
entirely
to
your
skill
and
thus
it
came
about
that
four
days
later
i
substituted
the
bogus
globe
for
the
real
one
and
unseen
dropped
the
picric
bomb
from
one
of
the
bridges
into
the
seine
on
the
morning
of
the
procession
i
was
compelled
to
allow
simard
several
drinks
of
absinthe
to
bring
him
up
to
a
point
where
he
could
be
depended
on
otherwise
his
anxiety
and
determination
to
fling
the
bomb
his
frenzy
against
all
government
made
it
certain
that
he
would
betray
both
of
us
before
the
fateful
moment
came
my
only
fear
was
that
i
could
not
stop
him
drinking
when
once
he
began
but
somehow
our
days
of
close
companionship
loathsome
as
they
were
to
me
seemed
to
have
had
the
effect
of
building
up
again
the
influence
i
held
over
him
in
former
days
and
his
yielding
more
or
less
to
my
wishes
appeared
to
be
quite
unconscious
on
his
part
the
procession
was
composed
entirely
of
carriages
each
containing
four
persons
two
englishmen
sat
on
the
back
seats
with
two
frenchmen
in
front
of
them
a
thick
crowd
lined
each
side
of
the
thoroughfare
cheering
vociferously
right
into
the
middle
of
the
procession
simard
launched
his
bomb
there
was
no
crash
of
explosion
the
missile
simply
went
to
pieces
as
if
it
were
an
earthenware
jar
and
there
arose
a
dense
column
of
very
white
smoke
in
the
immediate
vicinity
the
cheering
stopped
at
once
and
the
sinister
word
passed
from
lip
to
lip
in
awed
whispers
as
the
throwing
had
been
unnoticed
in
the
midst
of
the
commotion
i
held
simard
firmly
by
the
wrist
determined
he
should
not
draw
attention
to
himself
by
his
desire
for
immediate
flight
still
you
fool
i
hissed
into
his
ear
and
he
obeyed
trembling
the
pair
of
horses
in
front
of
which
the
bomb
fell
rose
for
a
moment
on
their
hind
legs
and
showed
signs
of
bolting
but
the
coachman
held
them
firmly
and
uplifted
his
hand
so
that
the
procession
behind
him
came
to
a
momentary
pause
no
one
in
the
carriages
moved
a
muscle
then
suddenly
the
tension
was
broken
by
a
great
and
simultaneous
cheer
wondering
at
this
i
turned
my
eyes
from
the
frightened
horses
to
the
column
of
pale
smoke
in
front
of
us
and
saw
that
in
some
manner
it
had
resolved
itself
into
a
gigantic
calla
lily
pure
white
while
from
the
base
of
this
sprung
the
lilies
of
france
delicately
tinted
of
course
this
could
not
have
happened
if
there
had
been
the
least
wind
but
the
air
was
so
still
that
the
vibration
of
the
cheering
caused
the
huge
lily
to
tremble
gently
as
it
stood
there
marvellously
poised
the
lily
of
peace
surrounded
by
the
lilies
of
france
that
was
the
design
and
if
you
ask
me
how
it
was
done
i
can
only
refer
you
to
my
pyrotechnist
and
say
that
whatever
a
frenchman
attempts
to
do
he
will
accomplish
artistically
and
now
these
imperturbable
english
who
had
been
seated
immobile
when
they
thought
a
bomb
was
thrown
stood
up
in
their
carriages
to
get
a
better
view
of
this
aerial
phenomenon
cheering
and
waving
their
hats
the
lily
gradually
thinned
and
dissolved
in
little
patches
of
cloud
that
floated
away
above
our
heads
can
not
stay
here
longer
groaned
simard
quaking
his
nerves
like
himself
in
rags
see
the
ghosts
of
those
i
have
killed
floating
around
me
on
then
but
do
not
hurry
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
london
but
it
was
absinthe
absinthe
all
the
way
and
when
we
reached
charing
cross
i
was
compelled
to
help
him
partly
insensible
into
a
cab
i
took
him
direct
to
imperial
flats
and
up
into
my
own
set
of
chambers
where
i
opened
my
strong
room
and
flung
him
inside
to
sleep
off
his
intoxication
and
subsist
on
bread
and
water
when
he
became
sober
i
attended
that
night
a
meeting
of
the
anarchists
and
detailed
accurately
the
story
of
our
escape
from
france
i
knew
we
had
been
watched
and
so
skipped
no
detail
i
reported
that
i
had
taken
simard
directly
to
my
compatriot
flat
to
eugène
valmont
the
man
who
had
given
me
employment
and
who
had
promised
to
do
what
he
could
for
simard
beginning
by
trying
to
break
him
of
the
absinthe
habit
as
he
was
now
a
physical
wreck
through
in
that
stimulant
it
was
curious
to
note
the
discussion
which
took
place
a
few
nights
afterwards
regarding
the
failure
of
the
picric
bomb
scientists
among
us
said
that
the
bomb
had
been
made
too
long
that
a
chemical
reaction
had
taken
place
which
destroyed
its
power
a
few
superstitious
ones
saw
a
miracle
in
what
had
happened
and
they
forthwith
left
our
organisation
then
again
things
were
made
easier
by
the
fact
that
the
man
who
constructed
the
bomb
evidently
at
what
he
had
done
disappeared
the
day
before
the
procession
and
has
never
since
been
heard
of
the
majority
of
the
anarchists
believed
he
had
made
a
bogus
bomb
and
had
fled
to
escape
their
vengeance
rather
than
to
evade
the
justice
of
the
law
simard
will
need
no
purgatory
in
the
next
world
i
kept
him
on
bread
and
water
for
a
month
in
my
strong
room
and
at
first
he
demanded
absinthe
with
threats
then
grovelled
begging
and
praying
for
it
after
that
a
period
of
depression
and
despair
ensued
but
finally
his
naturally
strong
constitution
conquered
and
began
to
build
itself
up
again
i
took
him
from
his
prison
one
midnight
and
gave
him
a
bed
in
my
soho
room
taking
care
in
bringing
him
away
that
he
would
never
recognise
the
place
where
he
had
been
incarcerated
in
my
dealings
with
him
i
had
always
been
that
old
man
paul
ducharme
next
morning
i
said
to
him
spoke
of
eugène
valmont
i
have
learned
that
he
lives
in
london
and
i
advise
you
to
call
upon
him
perhaps
he
can
get
you
something
to
do
simard
was
overjoyed
and
two
hours
later
as
eugène
valmont
i
received
him
in
my
flat
and
made
him
my
assistant
on
the
spot
from
that
time
forward
paul
ducharme
language
teacher
disappeared
from
the
earth
and
simard
abandoned
his
two
a
anarchy
and
absinthe
clue
of
the
silver
when
the
card
was
brought
in
to
me
i
looked
upon
it
with
some
misgiving
for
i
scented
a
commercial
transaction
and
although
such
cases
are
lucrative
enough
nevertheless
i
eugène
valmont
formerly
high
in
the
service
of
the
french
government
do
not
care
to
be
connected
with
them
they
usually
pertain
to
sordid
business
affairs
presenting
little
that
is
of
interest
to
a
man
who
in
his
time
has
dealt
with
subtle
questions
of
diplomacy
upon
which
the
welfare
of
nations
sometimes
turned
the
name
of
bentham
gibbes
is
familiar
to
everyone
connected
as
it
is
with
the
pickles
whose
glaring
announcements
in
crude
crimson
and
green
strike
the
eye
throughout
great
britain
and
shock
the
artistic
sense
wherever
seen
me
i
have
never
tasted
them
and
shall
not
so
long
as
a
french
restaurant
remains
open
in
london
but
i
doubt
not
they
are
as
pronounced
to
the
palate
as
their
advertisement
is
distressing
to
the
eye
if
then
this
gross
pickle
manufacturer
expected
me
to
track
down
those
who
were
infringing
upon
the
recipes
for
making
his
sauces
chutneys
and
the
like
he
would
find
himself
mistaken
for
i
was
now
in
a
position
to
pick
and
choose
my
cases
and
a
case
of
pickles
did
not
allure
me
of
imitations
said
the
advertisement
genuine
without
a
facsimile
of
the
signature
of
bentham
gibbes
ah
well
not
for
me
were
either
the
pickles
or
the
tracking
of
imitators
a
forged
cheque
yes
if
you
like
but
the
forged
signature
of
gibbes
on
a
pickle
bottle
was
out
of
my
line
nevertheless
i
said
to
armand
the
gentleman
in
and
he
did
so
to
my
astonishment
there
entered
a
young
man
quite
correctly
dressed
in
the
dark
faultless
waistcoat
and
trousers
that
proclaimed
a
bond
street
tailor
when
he
spoke
his
voice
and
language
were
those
of
a
gentleman
valmont
he
inquired
your
service
i
replied
bowing
and
waving
my
hand
as
armand
placed
a
chair
for
him
and
withdrew
am
a
barrister
with
chambers
in
the
temple
began
gibbes
for
some
days
a
matter
has
been
troubling
me
about
which
i
have
now
come
to
seek
your
advice
your
name
having
been
suggested
by
a
friend
in
whom
i
confided
i
acquainted
with
him
i
asked
think
not
replied
gibbes
also
is
a
barrister
with
chambers
in
the
same
building
as
my
own
lionel
dacre
is
his
name
never
heard
of
him
likely
not
nevertheless
he
recommended
you
as
a
man
who
could
keep
his
own
counsel
and
if
you
take
up
this
case
i
desire
the
utmost
secrecy
preserved
whatever
may
be
the
outcome
i
bowed
but
made
no
protestation
secrecy
is
a
matter
of
course
with
me
the
englishman
paused
for
a
few
moments
as
if
he
expected
fervent
assurances
then
went
on
with
no
trace
of
disappointment
on
his
countenance
at
not
receiving
them
the
night
of
the
i
gave
a
little
dinner
to
six
friends
of
mine
in
my
own
rooms
i
may
say
that
so
far
as
i
am
aware
they
are
all
gentlemen
of
unimpeachable
character
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
i
was
detained
later
than
i
expected
at
a
reception
and
in
driving
to
the
temple
was
still
further
delayed
by
a
block
of
traffic
in
piccadilly
so
that
when
i
arrived
at
my
chambers
there
was
barely
time
for
me
to
dress
and
receive
my
guests
my
man
johnson
had
everything
laid
out
ready
for
me
in
my
and
as
i
passed
through
to
it
i
hurriedly
flung
off
the
coat
i
was
wearing
and
carelessly
left
it
hanging
over
the
back
of
a
chair
in
the
where
neither
johnson
nor
myself
noticed
it
until
my
attention
was
called
to
it
after
the
dinner
was
over
and
everyone
rather
jolly
with
wine
coat
contains
an
inside
pocket
usually
any
i
wear
at
an
afternoon
reception
has
not
an
inside
pocket
but
i
had
been
rather
on
the
rush
all
day
father
is
a
manufacturer
whose
name
may
be
familiar
to
you
and
i
am
on
the
directors
board
of
his
company
on
this
occasion
i
took
a
cab
from
the
city
to
the
reception
i
spoke
of
and
had
not
time
to
go
and
change
at
my
rooms
the
reception
was
a
somewhat
bohemian
affair
extremely
interesting
of
course
but
not
too
particular
as
to
costume
so
i
went
as
i
was
in
this
inside
pocket
rested
a
thin
package
composed
of
two
pieces
of
cardboard
and
between
them
rested
five
bank
of
england
notes
folded
lengthwise
held
in
place
by
an
elastic
rubber
band
i
had
thrown
the
coat
across
the
in
such
a
way
that
the
inside
pocket
was
exposed
leaving
the
ends
of
the
notes
plainly
recognisable
over
the
coffee
and
cigars
one
of
my
guests
laughingly
called
attention
to
what
he
termed
my
vulgar
display
of
wealth
and
johnson
in
some
confusion
at
having
neglected
to
put
away
the
coat
now
picked
it
up
and
took
it
to
the
where
the
wraps
of
my
guests
lay
about
promiscuously
he
should
of
course
have
hung
it
up
in
my
wardrobe
but
he
said
afterwards
he
thought
it
belonged
to
the
guest
who
had
spoken
you
see
johnson
was
in
my
when
i
threw
my
coat
on
the
chair
in
the
corner
while
making
my
way
thither
and
i
suppose
he
had
not
noticed
the
coat
in
the
hurry
of
arriving
guests
otherwise
he
would
have
put
it
where
it
belonged
after
everybody
had
gone
johnson
came
to
me
and
said
the
coat
was
there
but
the
package
was
missing
nor
has
any
trace
of
it
been
found
since
that
night
dinner
was
fetched
in
from
outside
i
suppose
many
waiters
served
it
they
are
men
who
have
often
been
in
my
employ
on
similar
occasions
but
apart
from
that
they
had
left
my
chambers
before
the
incident
of
the
coat
happened
of
them
went
into
the
i
take
it
i
am
certain
that
not
even
suspicion
can
attach
to
either
of
the
waiters
man
johnson
been
with
me
for
years
he
could
easily
have
stolen
much
more
than
the
hundred
pounds
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
but
i
have
never
known
him
to
take
a
penny
that
did
not
belong
to
him
you
favour
me
with
the
names
of
your
guests
mr
gibbes
stern
sat
at
my
right
hand
and
at
my
left
lord
templemere
sir
john
sanclere
next
to
him
and
angus
mckeller
next
to
sanclere
after
viscount
stern
was
lionel
dacre
and
at
his
right
vincent
innis
on
a
sheet
of
paper
i
had
written
the
names
of
the
guests
and
noted
their
places
at
the
table
guest
drew
your
attention
to
the
money
dacre
there
a
window
looking
out
from
the
of
them
they
fastened
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
party
could
not
be
sure
very
likely
johnson
would
know
you
are
hinting
at
the
possibility
of
a
thief
coming
in
through
a
window
while
we
were
somewhat
noisy
over
our
wine
i
think
such
a
solution
highly
improbable
my
rooms
are
on
the
third
floor
and
a
thief
would
scarcely
venture
to
make
an
entrance
when
he
could
not
but
know
there
was
a
company
being
entertained
besides
this
the
coat
was
there
less
than
an
hour
and
it
appears
to
me
that
whoever
stole
those
notes
knew
where
they
were
seems
reasonable
i
had
to
admit
you
spoken
to
any
one
of
your
loss
no
one
but
dacre
who
recommended
me
to
see
you
oh
yes
and
to
johnson
of
course
i
could
not
help
noting
that
this
was
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
name
had
come
up
during
our
conversation
of
dacre
i
asked
well
you
see
he
occupies
chambers
in
the
same
building
on
the
ground
floor
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
and
we
are
by
way
of
being
firm
friends
then
it
was
he
who
had
called
attention
to
the
money
so
i
thought
he
should
know
the
sequel
did
he
take
your
news
that
you
call
attention
to
the
fact
he
seemed
slightly
troubled
i
should
like
to
say
however
that
you
must
not
be
misled
by
that
lionel
dacre
could
no
more
steal
than
he
could
lie
he
show
any
surprise
when
you
mentioned
the
theft
bentham
gibbes
paused
a
moment
before
replying
knitting
his
brows
in
thought
he
said
at
last
come
to
think
of
it
it
appeared
as
if
he
had
been
expecting
my
announcement
that
strike
you
as
rather
strange
mr
gibbes
my
mind
is
in
such
a
whirl
i
do
know
what
to
think
but
it
perfectly
absurd
to
suspect
dacre
if
you
knew
the
man
you
would
understand
what
i
mean
he
comes
of
an
excellent
family
and
he
is
oh
he
is
lionel
dacre
and
when
you
have
said
that
you
have
made
any
suspicion
absurd
suppose
you
caused
the
rooms
to
be
thoroughly
searched
the
packet
did
drop
out
and
remain
unnoticed
in
some
corner
johnson
and
myself
examined
every
inch
of
the
premises
you
the
numbers
of
the
notes
i
got
them
from
the
bank
next
morning
payment
was
stopped
and
so
far
not
one
of
the
five
has
been
presented
of
course
one
or
more
may
have
been
cashed
at
some
shop
but
none
have
been
offered
to
any
of
the
banks
note
is
not
accepted
without
scrutiny
so
the
chances
are
the
thief
may
find
some
difficulty
in
disposing
of
them
i
told
you
i
do
mind
the
loss
of
the
money
at
all
it
is
the
uncertainty
the
uneasiness
caused
by
the
incident
which
troubles
me
you
will
comprehend
how
little
i
care
about
the
notes
when
i
say
that
if
you
are
good
enough
to
interest
yourself
in
this
case
i
shall
be
disappointed
if
your
fee
does
not
exceed
the
amount
i
have
lost
gibbes
rose
as
he
said
this
and
i
accompanied
him
to
the
door
assuring
him
that
i
should
do
my
best
to
solve
the
mystery
whether
he
sprang
from
pickles
or
not
i
realised
he
was
a
polished
and
generous
gentleman
who
estimated
the
services
of
a
professional
expert
like
myself
at
their
true
value
i
shall
not
set
down
the
details
of
my
researches
during
the
following
few
days
because
the
trend
of
them
must
be
gone
over
in
the
account
of
that
remarkable
interview
in
which
i
took
part
somewhat
later
suffice
it
to
say
that
an
examination
of
the
rooms
and
a
close
of
johnson
satisfied
me
he
and
the
two
waiters
were
innocent
i
became
certain
no
thief
had
made
his
way
through
the
window
and
finally
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
notes
were
stolen
by
one
of
the
guests
further
investigation
convinced
me
that
the
thief
was
no
other
than
lionel
dacre
the
only
one
of
the
six
in
pressing
need
of
money
at
this
time
i
caused
dacre
to
be
shadowed
and
during
one
of
his
absences
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
man
hopper
a
surly
impolite
brute
who
accepted
my
golden
sovereign
quickly
enough
but
gave
me
little
in
exchange
for
it
while
i
conversed
with
him
there
arrived
in
the
passage
where
we
were
talking
together
a
huge
case
of
champagne
bearing
one
of
the
names
in
the
trade
and
branded
as
being
of
the
vintage
of
now
i
knew
that
the
product
of
camelot
frères
is
not
bought
as
cheaply
as
british
beer
and
i
also
had
learned
that
two
short
weeks
before
lionel
dacre
was
at
his
wits
end
for
money
yet
he
was
still
the
same
briefless
barrister
he
had
ever
been
on
the
morning
after
my
unsatisfactory
conversation
with
his
man
hopper
i
was
astonished
to
receive
the
following
note
written
on
a
dainty
correspondence
card
and
vellum
buildings
temple
lionel
dacre
presents
his
compliments
to
monsieur
eugène
valmont
and
would
be
obliged
if
monsieur
valmont
could
make
it
convenient
to
call
upon
him
in
his
chambers
tomorrow
morning
at
eleven
had
the
young
man
become
aware
that
he
was
being
shadowed
or
had
the
surly
servant
informed
him
of
the
inquiries
made
i
was
soon
to
know
i
called
punctually
at
eleven
next
morning
and
was
received
with
charming
urbanity
by
dacre
himself
the
taciturn
hopper
had
evidently
been
sent
away
for
the
occasion
dear
monsieur
valmont
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
began
the
young
man
with
more
of
effusiveness
than
i
had
ever
noticed
in
an
englishman
before
although
his
very
next
words
supplied
an
explanation
that
did
not
occur
to
me
until
afterwards
as
somewhat
believe
we
are
by
way
of
being
countrymen
and
therefore
although
the
hour
is
early
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
offer
you
some
of
this
bottled
sunshine
of
the
year
from
belle
to
whose
prosperity
and
honour
we
shall
drink
together
for
such
a
toast
any
hour
is
propitious
to
my
amazement
he
brought
forth
from
the
case
i
had
seen
arrive
two
days
before
a
bottle
of
that
superb
camelot
frères
said
i
to
myself
is
going
to
be
difficult
to
keep
a
clear
head
if
the
aroma
of
this
nectar
rises
to
the
brain
but
tempting
as
is
the
cup
i
shall
drink
sparingly
and
hope
he
may
not
be
so
judicious
sensitive
i
already
experienced
the
charm
of
his
personality
and
well
understood
the
friendship
bentham
gibbes
felt
for
him
but
i
saw
the
trap
spread
before
me
he
expected
under
the
influence
of
champagne
and
courtesy
to
extract
a
promise
from
me
which
i
must
find
myself
unable
to
give
you
interest
me
by
claiming
kinship
with
france
i
had
understood
that
you
belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
of
england
england
he
cried
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
outspreading
hands
truly
parisian
in
its
significance
trunk
belongs
to
england
of
course
but
the
root
ah
the
root
monsieur
valmont
penetrated
the
soil
from
which
this
wine
of
the
gods
has
been
drawn
then
filling
my
glass
and
his
own
he
cried
france
which
my
family
left
in
the
year
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
his
fervent
ejaculation
with
william
the
conqueror
that
is
a
long
time
ago
mr
dacre
years
perhaps
in
feelings
but
a
day
my
forefathers
came
over
to
steal
and
lord
how
well
they
accomplished
it
they
stole
the
whole
country
something
like
a
theft
say
i
under
that
prince
of
robbers
whom
you
have
well
named
the
conqueror
in
our
secret
hearts
we
all
admire
a
great
thief
and
if
not
a
great
one
then
an
expert
one
who
covers
his
tracks
so
perfectly
that
the
hounds
of
justice
are
baffled
in
attempting
to
follow
them
now
even
you
monsieur
valmont
i
can
see
you
are
the
most
generous
of
men
with
a
lively
sympathy
found
to
perfection
only
in
france
even
you
must
suffer
a
pang
of
regret
when
you
lay
a
thief
by
the
heels
who
has
done
his
task
deftly
fear
dacre
you
credit
me
with
a
magnanimity
to
which
i
dare
not
lay
claim
the
criminal
is
a
danger
to
society
true
you
are
in
the
right
monsieur
valmont
still
admit
there
are
cases
that
would
touch
you
tenderly
for
example
a
man
ordinarily
honest
a
great
need
a
sudden
opportunity
he
takes
that
of
which
another
has
abundance
and
he
nothing
what
then
monsieur
valmont
is
the
man
to
be
sent
to
perdition
for
a
momentary
weakness
his
words
astonished
me
was
i
on
the
verge
of
hearing
a
confession
it
almost
amounted
to
that
already
dacre
i
said
can
not
enter
into
the
subtleties
you
pursue
my
duty
is
to
find
the
criminal
i
say
you
are
in
the
right
monsieur
valmont
and
i
am
enchanted
to
find
so
sensible
a
head
on
french
shoulders
although
you
are
a
more
recent
arrival
if
i
may
say
so
than
myself
you
nevertheless
already
give
utterance
to
sentiments
which
do
honour
to
england
it
is
your
duty
to
hunt
down
the
criminal
very
well
in
that
i
think
i
can
aid
you
and
thus
have
taken
the
liberty
of
requesting
your
attendance
here
this
morning
let
me
fill
your
glass
again
monsieur
valmont
more
i
beg
of
you
mr
dacre
do
you
think
the
receiver
is
as
bad
as
the
thief
i
was
so
taken
aback
by
this
remark
that
i
suppose
my
face
showed
the
amazement
within
me
but
the
young
man
merely
laughed
with
apparently
enjoyment
poured
some
wine
into
his
own
glass
and
tossed
it
off
not
knowing
what
to
say
i
changed
the
current
of
conversation
gibbes
said
you
had
been
kind
enough
to
recommend
me
to
his
attention
may
i
ask
how
you
came
to
hear
of
me
who
has
not
heard
of
the
renowned
monsieur
valmont
and
as
he
said
this
for
the
first
time
there
began
to
grow
a
suspicion
in
my
mind
that
he
was
chaffing
me
as
it
is
called
in
england
a
procedure
which
i
can
not
endure
indeed
if
this
gentleman
practised
such
a
barbarism
in
my
own
country
he
would
find
himself
with
a
duel
on
his
hands
before
he
had
gone
far
however
the
next
instant
his
voice
resumed
its
original
fascination
and
i
listened
to
it
as
to
some
delicious
melody
need
only
mention
my
cousin
lady
gladys
dacre
and
you
will
at
once
understand
why
i
recommended
you
to
my
friend
the
case
of
lady
gladys
you
will
remember
required
a
delicate
touch
which
is
not
always
to
be
had
in
this
land
of
england
except
when
those
who
possess
the
gift
do
us
the
honour
to
sojourn
with
us
i
noticed
that
my
glass
was
again
filled
and
bowing
an
acknowledgment
of
his
compliment
i
indulged
in
another
sip
of
the
delicious
wine
i
sighed
for
i
began
to
realise
it
was
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
me
in
spite
of
my
disclaimer
to
tell
this
man
friend
he
had
stolen
the
money
all
this
time
he
had
been
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
while
i
occupied
a
chair
at
its
end
he
sat
there
in
careless
fashion
swinging
a
foot
to
and
fro
now
he
sprang
to
the
floor
and
drew
up
a
chair
placing
on
the
table
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
then
he
took
from
the
mantelshelf
a
packet
of
letters
and
i
was
astonished
to
see
they
were
held
together
by
two
bits
of
cardboard
and
a
rubber
band
similar
to
the
combination
that
had
contained
the
folded
bank
notes
with
great
nonchalance
he
slipped
off
the
rubber
band
threw
it
and
the
pieces
of
cardboard
on
the
table
before
me
leaving
the
documents
loose
to
his
hand
monsieur
valmont
he
cried
jauntily
have
been
occupied
for
several
days
on
this
case
the
case
of
my
dear
friend
bentham
gibbes
who
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
said
the
same
of
you
mr
dacre
am
gratified
to
hear
it
would
you
mind
letting
me
know
to
what
point
your
researches
have
led
you
have
led
me
in
a
direction
rather
than
to
a
point
in
the
direction
of
a
man
of
course
is
he
you
pardon
me
if
i
decline
to
answer
this
question
at
the
present
moment
means
you
are
not
sure
may
mean
dacre
that
i
am
employed
by
gibbes
and
do
not
feel
at
liberty
to
disclose
the
results
of
my
quest
without
his
permission
bentham
gibbes
and
i
are
entirely
at
one
in
this
matter
perhaps
you
are
aware
that
i
am
the
only
person
with
whom
he
has
discussed
the
case
beside
yourself
is
undoubtedly
true
dacre
still
you
see
the
difficulty
of
my
position
i
do
and
so
shall
press
you
no
further
but
i
also
have
been
studying
the
problem
in
a
purely
amateurish
way
of
course
you
will
perhaps
express
no
disinclination
to
learn
whether
or
not
my
deductions
agree
with
yours
in
the
least
i
should
be
very
glad
to
know
the
conclusion
at
which
you
have
arrived
may
i
ask
if
you
suspect
any
one
in
particular
i
do
you
name
him
i
shall
copy
the
admirable
reticence
you
yourself
have
shown
and
now
let
us
attack
this
mystery
in
a
sane
and
businesslike
manner
you
have
already
examined
the
room
well
here
is
a
rough
sketch
of
it
there
is
the
table
in
this
corner
stood
the
chair
on
which
the
coat
was
flung
here
sat
gibbes
at
the
head
of
the
table
those
on
the
side
had
their
backs
to
the
chair
i
being
on
the
centre
to
the
right
saw
the
chair
the
coat
and
the
notes
and
called
attention
to
them
now
our
first
duty
is
to
find
a
motive
if
it
were
a
murder
our
motive
might
be
hatred
revenge
robbery
what
you
like
as
it
is
simply
the
stealing
of
money
the
man
must
have
been
either
a
born
thief
or
else
some
hitherto
innocent
person
pressed
to
the
crime
by
great
necessity
do
you
agree
with
me
monsieur
valmont
you
follow
exactly
the
line
of
my
own
reasoning
well
it
is
unlikely
that
a
born
thief
was
one
of
guests
therefore
we
are
reduced
to
look
for
a
man
under
the
spur
of
necessity
a
man
who
has
no
money
of
his
own
but
who
must
raise
a
certain
amount
let
us
say
by
a
certain
date
if
we
can
find
such
a
man
in
that
company
do
you
not
agree
with
me
that
he
is
likely
to
be
the
thief
i
do
let
us
start
our
process
of
elimination
out
goes
viscount
stern
a
lucky
individual
with
twenty
thousand
acres
of
land
and
god
only
knows
what
income
i
mark
off
the
name
of
lord
templemere
one
of
his
majesty
judges
entirely
above
suspicion
next
sir
john
sanclere
he
also
is
rich
but
vincent
innis
is
still
richer
so
the
pencil
obliterates
both
names
now
we
arrive
at
angus
mckeller
an
author
of
some
note
as
you
are
well
aware
deriving
a
good
income
from
his
books
and
a
better
one
from
his
plays
a
canny
scot
so
we
may
rub
his
name
from
our
paper
and
our
memory
how
do
my
erasures
correspond
with
yours
monsieur
valmont
correspond
exactly
mr
dacre
am
flattered
to
hear
it
there
remains
one
name
untouched
mr
lionel
dacre
the
descendant
as
i
have
said
of
robbers
have
not
said
so
mr
dacre
my
dear
valmont
the
politeness
of
your
country
asserts
itself
let
us
not
be
deluded
but
follow
our
inquiry
wherever
it
leads
i
suspect
lionel
dacre
what
do
you
know
of
his
circumstances
before
the
dinner
of
the
as
i
made
no
reply
he
looked
up
at
me
with
his
frank
boyish
face
illumined
by
a
winning
smile
know
nothing
of
his
circumstances
he
asked
grieves
me
to
state
that
i
do
lionel
dacre
was
penniless
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
do
exaggerate
monsieur
valmont
cried
dacre
with
a
gesture
of
pathetic
protest
pocket
held
one
sixpence
two
pennies
and
a
halfpenny
how
came
you
to
suspect
he
was
penniless
knew
he
ordered
a
case
of
champagne
from
the
london
representative
of
camelot
frères
and
was
refused
unless
he
paid
the
money
down
right
and
then
when
you
were
talking
to
hopper
you
saw
that
case
of
champagne
delivered
excellent
excellent
monsieur
valmont
but
will
a
man
steal
think
you
even
to
supply
himself
with
so
delicious
a
wine
as
this
we
have
been
tasting
and
by
the
way
forgive
my
neglect
allow
me
to
fill
your
glass
monsieur
valmont
another
drop
if
you
will
excuse
me
mr
dacre
yes
champagne
should
not
be
mixed
with
evidence
when
we
have
finished
perhaps
what
further
proof
have
you
discovered
monsieur
hold
proof
that
dacre
was
threatened
with
bankruptcy
if
on
the
he
did
not
pay
a
bill
of
pounds
that
had
been
long
outstanding
i
hold
proof
that
this
was
paid
not
on
the
but
on
the
dacre
had
gone
to
the
solicitor
and
assured
him
he
would
pay
the
money
on
that
date
whereupon
he
was
given
two
days
grace
well
he
was
entitled
to
three
you
know
in
law
yes
there
monsieur
valmont
you
touch
the
fatal
point
the
threat
of
bankruptcy
will
drive
a
man
in
dacre
position
to
almost
any
crime
bankruptcy
to
a
barrister
means
ruin
it
means
a
career
blighted
it
means
a
life
buried
with
little
chance
of
resurrection
i
see
you
grasp
the
supreme
importance
of
that
bit
of
evidence
the
case
of
champagne
is
as
nothing
compared
with
it
and
this
reminds
me
that
in
the
crisis
now
upon
us
i
shall
take
another
sip
with
your
permission
sure
you
wo
join
me
at
this
juncture
mr
dacre
envy
your
moderation
here
to
the
success
of
our
search
monsieur
valmont
i
felt
sorry
for
the
gay
young
fellow
as
with
smiling
face
he
drank
the
champagne
monsieur
he
went
on
am
amazed
to
learn
how
much
you
have
discovered
really
i
think
tradespeople
solicitors
and
all
such
should
keep
better
guard
on
their
tongues
than
they
do
nevertheless
these
documents
at
my
elbow
which
i
expected
would
surprise
you
are
merely
the
letters
and
receipts
here
is
the
communication
from
the
solicitor
threatening
me
with
bankruptcy
here
is
his
receipt
dated
the
here
is
the
refusal
of
the
wine
merchant
and
here
is
his
receipt
for
the
money
here
are
smaller
bills
liquidated
with
my
pencil
we
will
add
them
up
pounds
the
principal
debt
bulks
large
we
add
the
smaller
items
and
it
reaches
a
total
of
pounds
seven
shillings
and
fourpence
let
us
now
examine
my
purse
here
is
a
note
there
is
a
golden
sovereign
i
now
count
out
and
place
on
the
table
twelve
and
sixpence
in
silver
and
two
pence
in
coppers
the
purse
thus
becomes
empty
let
us
add
the
silver
and
copper
to
the
amount
on
the
paper
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
or
is
the
sum
exactly
a
hundred
pounds
there
is
your
money
fully
accounted
for
me
dacre
i
said
i
observe
a
sovereign
resting
on
the
mantelpiece
dacre
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
with
greater
heartiness
than
i
had
yet
known
him
to
indulge
in
during
our
short
acquaintance
jove
he
cried
got
me
there
i
forgotten
entirely
about
that
pound
on
the
mantelpiece
which
belongs
to
you
me
impossible
does
and
can
not
interfere
in
the
least
with
our
century
calculation
that
is
the
sovereign
you
gave
to
my
man
hopper
who
knowing
me
to
be
took
it
and
shamefacedly
presented
it
to
me
that
i
might
enjoy
the
spending
of
it
hopper
belongs
to
our
family
or
the
family
belongs
to
him
i
am
never
sure
which
you
must
have
missed
in
him
the
deferential
bearing
of
a
in
paris
yet
he
is
true
gold
like
the
sovereign
you
bestowed
upon
him
and
he
bestowed
upon
me
now
here
monsieur
is
the
evidence
of
the
theft
together
with
the
rubber
band
and
two
pieces
of
cardboard
ask
my
friend
gibbes
to
examine
them
minutely
they
are
all
at
your
disposition
monsieur
and
thus
you
learn
how
much
easier
it
is
to
deal
with
the
master
than
with
the
servant
all
the
gold
you
possess
would
not
have
wrung
these
incriminating
documents
from
old
hopper
i
was
compelled
to
send
him
away
to
the
west
end
an
hour
ago
fearing
that
in
his
brutal
british
way
he
might
assault
you
if
he
got
an
inkling
of
your
mission
dacre
said
i
slowly
have
thoroughly
convinced
me
thought
i
would
he
interrupted
with
a
that
you
did
take
the
money
this
is
a
change
of
wind
surely
many
a
man
has
been
hanged
on
a
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
much
weaker
than
this
which
i
have
exhibited
to
you
do
you
see
the
subtlety
of
my
action
persons
in
a
hundred
would
say
no
man
could
be
such
a
fool
as
to
put
valmont
on
his
own
track
and
then
place
in
valmont
hands
such
striking
evidence
but
there
comes
in
my
craftiness
of
course
the
rock
you
run
up
against
will
be
gibbes
incredulity
the
first
question
he
will
ask
you
may
be
this
why
did
not
dacre
come
and
borrow
the
money
from
me
now
there
you
find
a
certain
weakness
in
your
chain
of
evidence
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
gibbes
would
lend
me
the
money
and
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
i
were
pressed
to
the
wall
i
should
ask
him
dacre
said
i
have
been
playing
with
me
i
should
resent
that
with
most
men
but
whether
it
is
your
own
genial
manner
or
the
effect
of
this
excellent
champagne
or
both
together
i
forgive
you
but
i
am
convinced
of
another
thing
you
know
who
took
the
money
do
know
but
i
suspect
you
tell
me
whom
you
suspect
would
not
be
fair
but
i
shall
now
take
the
liberty
of
filling
your
glass
with
champagne
am
your
guest
mr
dacre
answered
monsieur
he
replied
pouring
out
the
wine
now
i
offer
you
a
clue
find
out
all
about
the
story
of
the
silver
spoons
story
of
the
silver
spoons
what
silver
spoons
that
is
the
point
step
out
of
the
temple
into
fleet
street
seize
the
first
man
you
meet
by
the
shoulder
and
ask
him
to
tell
you
about
the
silver
spoons
there
are
but
two
men
and
two
spoons
concerned
when
you
learn
who
those
two
men
are
you
will
know
that
one
of
them
did
not
take
the
money
and
i
give
you
my
assurance
that
the
other
did
speak
in
mystery
mr
dacre
certainly
for
i
am
speaking
to
monsieur
eugène
valmont
echo
your
words
sir
admirably
answered
you
put
me
on
my
mettle
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
see
your
kindly
drift
you
wish
me
to
solve
the
mystery
of
this
stolen
money
sir
me
honour
and
i
drink
to
your
health
yours
monsieur
said
lionel
dacre
and
thus
we
drank
and
parted
on
leaving
dacre
i
took
a
hansom
to
a
café
in
regent
street
which
is
a
passable
imitation
of
similar
places
of
refreshment
in
paris
there
calling
for
a
cup
of
black
coffee
i
sat
down
to
think
the
clue
of
the
silver
spoons
he
had
laughingly
suggested
that
i
should
take
by
the
shoulders
the
first
man
i
met
and
ask
him
what
the
story
of
the
silver
spoons
was
this
course
naturally
struck
me
as
absurd
and
he
doubtless
intended
it
to
seem
absurd
nevertheless
it
contained
a
hint
i
must
ask
somebody
and
that
the
right
person
to
tell
me
the
tale
of
the
silver
spoons
under
the
influence
of
the
black
coffee
i
reasoned
it
out
in
this
way
on
the
night
of
the
one
of
the
six
guests
there
present
stole
a
hundred
pounds
but
dacre
had
said
that
an
actor
in
the
silver
spoon
episode
was
the
actual
thief
that
person
then
must
have
been
one
of
gibbes
guests
at
the
dinner
of
the
probably
two
of
the
guests
were
the
participators
in
the
silver
spoon
comedy
but
be
that
as
it
may
it
followed
that
one
at
least
of
the
men
around
gibbes
table
knew
the
episode
of
the
silver
spoons
perhaps
bentham
gibbes
himself
was
cognisant
of
it
it
followed
therefore
that
the
easiest
plan
was
to
question
each
of
the
men
who
partook
of
that
dinner
yet
if
only
one
knew
about
the
spoons
that
one
must
also
have
some
idea
that
these
spoons
formed
the
clue
which
attached
him
to
the
crime
of
the
in
which
case
he
was
little
likely
to
divulge
what
he
knew
to
an
entire
stranger
of
course
i
might
go
to
dacre
himself
and
demand
the
story
of
the
silver
spoons
but
this
would
be
a
confession
of
failure
on
my
part
and
i
rather
dreaded
lionel
dacre
hearty
laughter
when
i
admitted
that
the
mystery
was
too
much
for
me
besides
this
i
was
very
well
aware
of
the
young
man
kindly
intentions
towards
me
he
wished
me
to
unravel
the
coil
myself
and
so
i
determined
not
to
go
to
him
except
as
a
last
resource
i
resolved
to
begin
with
gibbes
and
finishing
my
coffee
i
got
again
into
a
hansom
and
drove
back
to
the
temple
i
found
bentham
gibbes
in
his
room
and
after
greeting
me
his
first
inquiry
was
about
the
case
are
you
getting
on
he
asked
think
i
getting
on
fairly
well
i
replied
expect
to
finish
in
a
day
or
two
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
the
story
of
the
silver
spoons
silver
spoons
he
echoed
quite
evidently
not
understanding
me
happened
an
incident
in
which
two
men
were
engaged
and
this
incident
related
to
a
pair
of
silver
spoons
i
want
to
get
the
particulars
of
that
have
the
slightest
idea
what
you
are
talking
about
replied
gibbes
thoroughly
bewildered
will
need
to
be
more
definite
i
fear
if
you
are
to
get
any
help
from
me
can
not
be
more
definite
because
i
have
already
told
you
all
i
know
bearing
has
all
this
on
our
own
case
was
informed
that
if
i
got
hold
of
the
clue
of
the
silver
spoons
i
should
be
in
a
fair
way
of
settling
our
case
told
you
that
lionel
dacre
does
dacre
refer
to
his
own
conjuring
do
know
i
sure
what
was
his
conjuring
very
clever
trick
he
did
one
night
at
dinner
here
about
two
months
ago
it
anything
to
do
with
silver
spoons
it
was
silver
spoons
or
silver
forks
or
something
of
that
kind
i
had
entirely
forgotten
the
incident
so
far
as
i
recollect
at
the
moment
there
was
a
man
of
great
expertness
in
one
of
the
music
halls
and
the
talk
turned
upon
him
then
dacre
said
the
tricks
he
did
were
easy
and
holding
up
a
spoon
or
a
fork
i
remember
which
he
professed
his
ability
to
make
it
disappear
before
our
eyes
to
be
found
afterwards
in
the
clothing
of
some
one
there
present
several
offered
to
bet
that
he
could
do
nothing
of
the
kind
but
he
said
he
would
bet
with
no
one
but
innis
who
sat
opposite
him
innis
with
some
reluctance
accepted
the
bet
and
then
dacre
with
a
great
show
of
the
usual
conjurer
gesticulations
spread
forth
his
empty
hands
and
said
we
should
find
the
spoon
in
innis
pocket
and
there
sure
enough
it
was
it
seemed
a
proper
trick
but
we
were
never
able
to
get
him
to
repeat
it
you
very
much
gibbes
i
think
i
see
daylight
now
you
do
you
are
cleverer
than
i
by
a
long
chalk
cried
bentham
gibbes
as
i
took
my
departure
i
went
directly
downstairs
and
knocked
at
dacre
door
once
more
he
opened
the
door
himself
his
man
not
yet
having
returned
monsieur
he
cried
already
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
so
soon
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
silver
spoon
entanglement
think
i
have
dacre
you
were
sitting
at
dinner
opposite
mr
vincent
innis
you
saw
him
conceal
a
silver
spoon
in
his
pocket
you
probably
waited
for
some
time
to
understand
what
he
meant
by
this
and
as
he
did
not
return
the
spoon
to
its
place
you
proposed
a
conjuring
trick
made
the
bet
with
him
and
thus
the
spoon
was
returned
to
the
table
excellent
monsieur
that
is
very
nearly
what
occurred
except
that
i
acted
at
once
i
had
had
experiences
with
vincent
innis
before
never
did
he
enter
these
rooms
of
mine
without
my
missing
some
little
trinket
after
he
was
gone
although
innis
is
a
very
rich
person
i
am
not
a
man
of
many
possessions
so
if
anything
is
taken
i
meet
little
difficulty
in
coming
to
a
knowledge
of
my
loss
of
course
i
never
mentioned
these
abstractions
to
him
they
were
all
trivial
as
i
have
said
and
so
far
as
the
silver
spoon
was
concerned
it
was
of
no
great
value
either
but
i
thought
the
bet
and
the
recovery
of
the
spoon
would
teach
him
a
lesson
it
apparently
has
not
done
so
on
the
night
of
the
he
sat
at
my
right
hand
as
you
will
see
by
consulting
your
diagram
of
the
table
and
the
guests
i
asked
him
a
question
twice
to
which
he
did
not
reply
and
looking
at
him
i
was
startled
by
the
expression
in
his
eyes
they
were
fixed
on
a
distant
corner
of
the
room
and
following
his
gaze
i
saw
what
he
was
staring
at
with
such
hypnotising
concentration
so
absorbed
was
he
in
contemplation
of
the
packet
there
so
plainly
exposed
now
my
attention
was
turned
to
it
that
he
seemed
to
be
entirely
oblivious
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
i
roused
him
from
his
trance
by
jocularly
calling
gibbes
attention
to
the
display
of
money
i
expected
in
this
way
to
save
innis
from
committing
the
act
which
he
seemingly
did
commit
imagine
then
the
dilemma
in
which
i
was
placed
when
gibbes
confided
to
me
the
morning
after
what
had
occurred
the
night
before
i
was
positive
innis
had
taken
the
money
yet
i
possessed
no
proof
of
it
i
could
not
tell
gibbes
and
i
dare
not
speak
to
innis
of
course
monsieur
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
innis
is
not
a
thief
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
he
has
no
need
to
steal
and
yet
apparently
can
not
help
doing
so
i
am
sure
that
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
pass
those
notes
they
are
doubtless
resting
securely
in
his
house
at
kensington
he
is
in
fact
a
kleptomaniac
or
a
maniac
of
some
sort
and
now
monsieur
was
my
hint
regarding
the
silver
spoons
of
any
value
to
you
the
most
infinite
value
mr
dacre
let
me
make
another
suggestion
i
leave
it
entirely
to
your
bravery
a
bravery
which
i
confess
i
do
not
myself
possess
will
you
take
a
hansom
drive
to
innis
house
on
the
cromwell
road
confront
him
quietly
and
ask
for
the
return
of
the
packet
i
am
anxious
to
know
what
will
happen
if
he
hands
it
to
you
as
i
expect
he
will
then
you
must
tell
gibbes
the
whole
story
dacre
your
suggestion
shall
be
immediately
acted
upon
and
i
thank
you
for
your
compliment
to
my
courage
i
found
that
innis
inhabited
a
very
grand
house
after
a
time
he
entered
the
study
on
the
ground
floor
to
which
i
had
been
conducted
he
held
my
card
in
his
hand
and
was
looking
at
it
with
some
surprise
think
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
monsieur
valmont
he
said
courteously
enough
i
ventured
to
call
on
a
matter
of
business
i
was
once
investigator
for
the
french
government
and
now
am
doing
private
detective
work
here
in
london
and
how
is
that
supposed
to
interest
me
there
is
nothing
that
i
wish
investigated
i
did
not
send
for
you
did
i
innis
i
merely
took
the
liberty
of
calling
to
ask
you
to
let
me
have
the
package
you
took
from
bentham
gibbes
pocket
on
the
night
of
the
wishes
it
returned
does
he
innis
calmly
walked
to
a
desk
which
he
unlocked
and
opened
displaying
a
veritable
museum
of
trinkets
of
one
sort
and
another
pulling
out
a
small
drawer
he
took
from
it
the
packet
containing
the
five
notes
apparently
it
had
never
been
opened
with
a
smile
he
handed
it
to
me
will
make
my
apologies
to
gibbes
for
not
returning
it
before
tell
him
i
have
been
unusually
busy
of
late
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
said
i
with
a
bow
so
much
monsieur
valmont
innis
and
so
i
returned
the
packet
to
bentham
gibbes
who
pulled
the
notes
from
between
their
pasteboard
protection
and
begged
me
to
accept
them
chizelrigg
missing
the
name
of
the
late
lord
chizelrigg
never
comes
to
my
mind
without
instantly
suggesting
that
of
edison
i
never
saw
the
late
lord
chizelrigg
and
i
have
met
edison
only
twice
in
my
life
yet
the
two
men
are
linked
in
my
memory
and
it
was
a
remark
the
latter
once
made
that
in
great
measure
enabled
me
to
solve
the
mystery
which
the
former
had
wrapped
round
his
actions
there
is
no
memorandum
at
hand
to
tell
me
the
year
in
which
those
two
meetings
with
edison
took
place
i
received
a
note
from
the
italian
ambassador
in
paris
requesting
me
to
wait
upon
him
at
the
embassy
i
learned
that
on
the
next
day
a
deputation
was
to
set
out
from
the
embassy
to
one
of
the
chief
hotels
there
to
make
a
call
in
state
upon
the
great
american
inventor
and
formally
present
to
him
various
insignia
accompanying
certain
honours
which
the
king
of
italy
had
conferred
upon
him
as
many
italian
nobles
of
high
rank
had
been
invited
and
as
these
dignitaries
would
not
only
be
robed
in
the
costumes
pertaining
to
their
orders
but
in
many
cases
would
wear
jewels
of
almost
inestimable
value
my
presence
was
desired
in
the
belief
that
i
might
perhaps
be
able
to
ward
off
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
gentry
who
might
possibly
make
an
effort
to
gain
these
treasures
and
i
may
add
with
perhaps
some
little
no
occurred
edison
of
course
had
long
before
received
notification
of
the
hour
at
which
the
deputation
would
wait
upon
him
but
when
we
entered
the
large
parlour
assigned
to
the
inventor
it
was
evident
to
me
at
a
glance
that
the
celebrated
man
had
forgotten
all
about
the
function
he
stood
by
a
bare
table
from
which
the
cloth
had
been
jerked
and
flung
into
a
corner
and
upon
that
table
were
placed
several
bits
of
black
and
greasy
machinery
cog
wheels
pulleys
bolts
etc
these
seemingly
belonged
to
a
french
workman
who
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
one
of
the
parts
in
his
grimy
hand
edison
own
hands
were
not
too
clean
for
he
had
palpably
been
examining
the
material
and
conversing
with
the
workman
who
wore
the
ordinary
long
blouse
of
an
iron
craftsman
in
a
small
way
i
judged
him
to
be
a
man
with
a
little
shop
of
his
own
in
some
back
street
who
did
odd
jobs
of
engineering
assisted
perhaps
by
a
skilled
helper
or
two
and
a
few
apprentices
edison
looked
sternly
towards
the
door
as
the
solemn
procession
filed
in
and
there
was
a
trace
of
annoyance
on
his
face
at
the
interruption
mixed
with
a
shade
of
perplexity
as
to
what
this
gorgeous
display
all
meant
the
italian
is
as
ceremonious
as
the
spaniard
where
a
function
is
concerned
and
the
official
who
held
the
ornate
box
which
contained
the
jewellery
resting
on
a
velvet
cushion
stepped
slowly
forward
and
came
to
a
stand
in
front
of
the
bewildered
american
then
the
ambassador
in
sonorous
voice
spoke
some
gracious
words
regarding
the
friendship
existing
between
the
united
states
and
italy
expressed
a
wish
that
their
rivalry
should
ever
take
the
form
of
benefits
conferred
upon
the
human
race
and
instanced
the
honoured
recipient
as
the
most
notable
example
the
world
had
yet
produced
of
a
man
bestowing
blessings
upon
all
nations
in
the
arts
of
peace
the
eloquent
ambassador
concluded
by
saying
that
at
the
command
of
his
royal
master
it
was
both
his
duty
and
his
pleasure
to
present
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
edison
visibly
ill
at
ease
nevertheless
made
a
suitable
reply
in
the
fewest
possible
words
and
the
being
thus
at
an
end
the
noblemen
headed
by
their
ambassador
slowly
retired
myself
forming
the
tail
of
the
procession
inwardly
i
deeply
sympathised
with
the
french
workman
who
thus
unexpectedly
found
himself
confronted
by
so
much
magnificence
he
cast
one
wild
look
about
him
but
saw
that
his
retreat
was
cut
off
unless
he
displaced
some
of
these
gorgeous
grandees
he
tried
then
to
shrink
into
himself
and
finally
stood
helpless
like
one
paralysed
in
spite
of
republican
institutions
there
is
deep
down
in
every
frenchman
heart
a
respect
and
awe
for
official
pageants
sumptuously
staged
and
costumed
as
this
one
was
but
he
likes
to
view
it
from
afar
and
supported
by
his
fellows
not
thrust
incongruously
into
the
midst
of
things
as
was
the
case
with
this
engineer
as
i
passed
out
i
cast
a
glance
over
my
shoulder
at
the
humble
artisan
content
with
a
profit
of
a
few
francs
a
day
and
at
the
millionaire
inventor
opposite
him
edison
face
which
during
the
address
had
been
cold
and
impassive
reminding
me
vividly
of
a
bust
of
napoleon
was
now
all
aglow
with
enthusiasm
as
he
turned
to
his
humble
visitor
he
cried
joyfully
to
the
workman
minute
demonstration
is
worth
an
hour
explanation
i
call
round
tomorrow
at
your
shop
about
ten
and
show
you
how
to
make
the
thing
work
i
lingered
in
the
hall
until
the
frenchman
came
out
then
introducing
myself
to
him
asked
the
privilege
of
visiting
his
shop
next
day
at
ten
this
was
accorded
with
that
courtesy
which
you
will
always
find
among
the
industrial
classes
of
france
and
next
day
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
edison
during
our
conversation
i
complimented
him
on
his
invention
of
the
incandescent
electric
light
and
this
was
the
reply
that
has
ever
remained
in
my
memory
was
not
an
invention
but
a
discovery
we
knew
what
we
wanted
a
carbonised
tissue
which
would
withstand
the
electric
current
in
a
vacuum
for
say
a
thousand
hours
if
no
such
tissue
existed
then
the
incandescent
light
as
we
know
it
was
not
possible
my
assistants
started
out
to
find
this
tissue
and
we
simply
carbonised
everything
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
and
ran
the
current
through
it
in
a
vacuum
at
last
we
struck
the
right
thing
as
we
were
bound
to
do
if
we
kept
on
long
enough
and
if
the
thing
existed
patience
and
hard
work
will
overcome
any
obstacle
this
belief
has
been
of
great
assistance
to
me
in
my
profession
i
know
the
idea
is
prevalent
that
a
detective
arrives
at
his
solutions
in
a
dramatic
way
through
following
clues
invisible
to
the
ordinary
man
this
doubtless
frequently
happens
but
as
a
general
thing
the
patience
and
hard
work
which
edison
commends
is
a
much
safer
guide
very
often
the
following
of
excellent
clues
had
led
me
to
disaster
as
was
the
case
with
my
unfortunate
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
five
hundred
diamonds
as
i
was
saying
i
never
think
of
the
late
lord
chizelrigg
without
remembering
edison
at
the
same
time
and
yet
the
two
were
very
dissimilar
i
suppose
lord
chizelrigg
was
the
most
useless
man
that
ever
lived
while
edison
is
the
opposite
one
day
my
servant
brought
in
to
me
a
card
on
which
was
engraved
chizelrigg
his
lordship
in
i
said
and
there
appeared
a
young
man
of
perhaps
or
well
dressed
and
of
most
charming
manners
who
nevertheless
began
his
interview
by
asking
a
question
such
as
had
never
before
been
addressed
to
me
and
which
if
put
to
a
solicitor
or
other
professional
man
would
have
been
answered
with
some
indignation
indeed
i
believe
it
is
a
written
or
unwritten
law
of
the
legal
profession
that
the
acceptance
of
such
a
proposal
as
lord
chizelrigg
made
to
me
would
if
proved
result
in
the
disgrace
and
ruin
of
the
lawyer
valmont
began
lord
chizelrigg
you
ever
take
up
cases
on
speculation
speculation
sir
i
do
not
think
i
understand
you
his
lordship
blushed
like
a
girl
and
stammered
slightly
as
he
attempted
an
explanation
i
mean
is
do
you
accept
a
case
on
a
contingent
fee
that
is
to
say
monsieur
er
well
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
no
results
no
pay
i
replied
somewhat
severely
an
offer
has
never
been
made
to
me
and
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
decline
it
were
i
favoured
with
the
opportunity
in
the
cases
submitted
to
me
i
devote
my
time
and
attention
to
their
solution
i
try
to
deserve
success
but
i
can
not
command
it
and
as
in
the
interim
i
must
live
i
am
reluctantly
compelled
to
make
a
charge
for
my
time
at
least
i
believe
the
doctor
sends
in
his
bill
though
the
patient
dies
the
young
man
laughed
uneasily
and
seemed
almost
too
embarrassed
to
proceed
but
finally
he
said
illustration
strikes
home
with
greater
accuracy
than
probably
you
imagined
when
you
uttered
it
i
have
just
paid
my
last
penny
to
the
physician
who
attended
my
late
uncle
lord
chizelrigg
who
died
six
months
ago
i
am
fully
aware
that
the
suggestion
i
made
may
seem
like
a
reflection
upon
your
skill
or
rather
as
implying
a
doubt
regarding
it
but
i
should
be
grieved
monsieur
if
you
fell
into
such
an
error
i
could
have
come
here
and
commissioned
you
to
undertake
some
elucidation
of
the
strange
situation
in
which
i
find
myself
and
i
make
no
doubt
you
would
have
accepted
the
task
if
your
numerous
engagements
had
permitted
then
if
you
failed
i
should
have
been
unable
to
pay
you
for
i
am
practically
bankrupt
my
whole
desire
therefore
was
to
make
an
honest
beginning
and
to
let
you
know
exactly
how
i
stand
if
you
succeed
i
shall
be
a
rich
man
if
you
do
not
succeed
i
shall
be
what
i
am
now
penniless
have
i
made
it
plain
now
why
i
began
with
a
question
which
you
had
every
right
to
resent
plain
my
lord
and
your
candour
does
you
credit
i
was
very
much
taken
with
the
unassuming
manners
of
the
young
man
and
his
evident
desire
to
accept
no
service
under
false
pretences
when
i
had
finished
my
sentence
the
pauper
nobleman
rose
to
his
feet
and
bowed
am
very
much
your
debtor
monsieur
for
your
courtesy
in
receiving
me
and
can
only
beg
pardon
for
occupying
your
time
on
a
futile
quest
i
wish
you
monsieur
moment
my
lord
i
rejoined
waving
him
to
his
chair
again
i
am
unprepared
to
accept
a
commission
on
the
terms
you
suggest
i
may
nevertheless
be
able
to
offer
a
hint
or
two
that
will
prove
of
service
to
you
i
think
i
remember
the
announcement
of
lord
chizelrigg
death
he
was
somewhat
eccentric
was
he
not
said
the
young
man
with
a
slight
laugh
seating
himself
again
vaguely
remember
that
he
was
accredited
with
the
possession
of
something
like
twenty
thousand
acres
of
land
thousand
as
a
matter
of
fact
replied
my
visitor
you
fallen
heir
to
the
lands
as
well
as
to
the
title
yes
the
estate
was
entailed
the
old
gentleman
could
not
divert
it
from
me
if
he
would
and
i
rather
suspect
that
fact
must
have
been
the
cause
of
some
worry
to
him
surely
my
lord
a
man
who
owns
as
one
might
say
a
principality
in
this
wealthy
realm
of
england
can
not
be
penniless
again
the
young
man
laughed
no
he
replied
thrusting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
bringing
to
light
a
few
brown
coppers
and
a
white
silver
piece
possess
enough
money
to
buy
some
food
tonight
but
not
enough
to
dine
at
the
hotel
cecil
you
see
it
is
like
this
i
belong
to
a
somewhat
ancient
family
various
members
of
whom
went
the
pace
and
mortgaged
their
acres
up
to
the
hilt
i
could
not
raise
a
further
penny
on
my
estates
were
i
to
try
my
hardest
because
at
the
time
the
money
was
lent
land
was
much
more
valuable
than
it
is
today
agricultural
depression
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
have
if
i
may
put
it
so
left
me
a
good
many
thousands
worse
off
than
if
i
had
no
land
at
all
besides
this
during
my
late
uncle
life
parliament
on
his
behalf
intervened
once
or
twice
allowing
him
in
the
first
place
to
cut
valuable
timber
and
in
the
second
place
to
sell
the
pictures
of
chizelrigg
chase
at
christie
for
figures
which
make
one
mouth
water
what
became
of
the
money
i
asked
whereupon
once
more
this
genial
nobleman
laughed
is
exactly
what
i
came
up
in
the
lift
to
learn
if
monsieur
valmont
could
discover
lord
you
interest
me
i
said
quite
truly
with
an
uneasy
apprehension
that
i
should
take
up
his
case
after
all
for
i
liked
the
young
man
already
his
lack
of
pretence
appealed
to
me
and
that
sympathy
which
is
so
universal
among
my
countrymen
enveloped
him
as
i
may
say
quite
independent
of
my
own
will
uncle
went
on
lord
chizelrigg
somewhat
of
an
anomaly
in
our
family
he
must
have
been
a
reversal
to
a
very
very
ancient
type
a
type
of
which
we
have
no
record
he
was
as
miserly
as
his
forefathers
were
prodigal
when
he
came
into
the
title
and
estate
some
twenty
years
ago
he
dismissed
the
whole
retinue
of
servants
and
indeed
was
defendant
in
several
cases
at
law
where
retainers
of
our
family
brought
suit
against
him
for
wrongful
dismissal
or
dismissal
without
a
penny
compensation
in
lieu
of
notice
i
am
pleased
to
say
he
lost
all
his
cases
and
when
he
pleaded
poverty
got
permission
to
sell
a
certain
number
of
heirlooms
enabling
him
to
make
compensation
and
giving
him
something
on
which
to
live
these
heirlooms
at
auction
sold
so
unexpectedly
well
that
my
uncle
acquired
a
taste
as
it
were
of
what
might
be
done
he
could
always
prove
that
the
rents
went
to
the
mortgagees
and
that
he
had
nothing
on
which
to
exist
so
on
several
occasions
he
obtained
permission
from
the
courts
to
cut
timber
and
sell
pictures
until
he
denuded
the
estate
and
made
an
empty
barn
of
the
old
manor
house
he
lived
like
any
labourer
occupying
himself
sometimes
as
a
carpenter
sometimes
as
a
blacksmith
indeed
he
made
a
blacksmith
shop
of
the
library
one
of
the
most
noble
rooms
in
britain
containing
thousands
of
valuable
books
which
again
and
again
he
applied
for
permission
to
sell
but
this
privilege
was
never
granted
to
him
i
find
on
coming
into
the
property
that
my
uncle
quite
persistently
evaded
the
law
and
depleted
this
superb
collection
book
by
book
surreptitiously
through
dealers
in
london
this
of
course
would
have
got
him
into
deep
trouble
if
it
had
been
discovered
before
his
death
but
now
the
valuable
volumes
are
gone
and
there
is
no
redress
many
of
them
are
doubtless
in
america
or
in
museums
and
collections
of
europe
wish
me
to
trace
them
perhaps
i
interpolated
no
they
are
past
praying
for
the
old
man
made
tens
of
thousands
by
the
sale
of
the
timber
and
other
thousands
by
disposing
of
the
pictures
the
house
is
denuded
of
its
fine
old
furniture
which
was
immensely
valuable
and
then
the
books
as
i
have
said
must
have
brought
in
the
revenue
of
a
prince
if
he
got
anything
like
their
value
and
you
may
be
sure
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
know
their
worth
since
the
last
refusal
of
the
courts
to
allow
him
further
relief
as
he
termed
it
which
was
some
seven
years
ago
he
had
quite
evidently
been
disposing
of
books
and
furniture
by
a
private
sale
in
defiance
of
the
law
at
that
time
i
was
under
age
but
my
guardians
opposed
his
application
to
the
courts
and
demanded
an
account
of
the
moneys
already
in
his
hands
the
judges
upheld
the
opposition
of
my
guardians
and
refused
to
allow
a
further
spoliation
of
the
estate
but
they
did
not
grant
the
accounting
my
guardians
asked
because
the
proceeds
of
the
former
sales
were
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
my
uncle
and
were
sanctioned
by
the
law
to
permit
him
to
live
as
befitted
his
station
if
he
lived
meagrely
instead
of
lavishly
as
my
guardians
contended
that
the
judges
said
was
his
affair
and
there
the
matter
ended
uncle
took
a
violent
dislike
to
me
on
account
of
this
opposition
to
his
last
application
although
of
course
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
he
lived
like
a
hermit
mostly
in
the
library
and
was
waited
upon
by
an
old
man
and
his
wife
and
these
three
were
the
only
inhabitants
of
a
mansion
that
could
comfortably
house
a
hundred
he
visited
nobody
and
would
allow
no
one
to
approach
chizelrigg
chase
in
order
that
all
who
had
the
misfortune
to
have
dealing
with
him
should
continue
to
endure
trouble
after
his
death
he
left
what
might
be
called
a
will
but
which
rather
may
be
termed
a
letter
to
me
here
is
a
copy
of
it
my
dear
tom
you
will
find
your
fortune
between
a
couple
of
sheets
of
paper
in
the
library
your
affectionate
uncle
reginald
moran
earl
of
chizelrigg
should
doubt
if
that
were
a
legal
will
said
i
does
need
to
be
replied
the
young
man
with
a
smile
am
and
heir
to
everything
he
possessed
although
of
course
he
might
have
given
his
money
elsewhere
if
he
had
chosen
to
do
so
why
he
did
not
bequeath
it
to
some
institution
i
do
not
know
he
knew
no
man
personally
except
his
own
servants
whom
he
misused
and
starved
but
as
he
told
them
he
misused
and
starved
himself
so
they
had
no
cause
to
grumble
he
said
he
was
treating
them
like
one
of
the
family
i
suppose
he
thought
it
would
cause
me
more
worry
and
anxiety
if
he
concealed
the
money
and
put
me
on
the
wrong
scent
which
i
am
convinced
he
has
done
than
to
leave
it
openly
to
any
person
or
charity
need
not
ask
if
you
have
searched
the
library
it
why
there
never
was
such
a
search
since
the
world
began
you
put
the
task
into
incompetent
hands
are
hinting
monsieur
valmont
that
i
engaged
others
until
my
money
was
gone
then
came
to
you
with
a
speculative
proposal
let
me
assure
you
such
is
not
the
case
incompetent
hands
i
grant
you
but
the
hands
were
my
own
for
the
past
six
months
i
have
lived
practically
as
my
uncle
lived
i
have
rummaged
that
library
from
floor
to
ceiling
it
was
left
in
a
frightful
state
littered
with
old
newspapers
accounts
and
then
of
course
there
were
the
books
remaining
in
the
library
still
a
formidable
collection
your
uncle
a
religious
man
could
not
say
i
surmise
not
you
see
i
was
unacquainted
with
him
and
never
saw
him
until
after
his
death
i
fancy
he
was
not
religious
otherwise
he
could
not
have
acted
as
he
did
still
he
proved
himself
a
man
of
such
twisted
mentality
that
anything
is
possible
knew
a
case
once
where
an
heir
who
expected
a
large
sum
of
money
was
bequeathed
a
family
bible
which
he
threw
into
the
fire
learning
afterwards
to
his
dismay
that
it
contained
many
thousands
of
pounds
in
bank
of
england
notes
the
object
of
the
devisor
being
to
induce
the
legatee
to
read
the
good
book
or
suffer
through
the
neglect
of
it
have
searched
the
scriptures
said
the
youthful
earl
with
a
laugh
the
benefit
has
been
moral
rather
than
material
there
any
chance
that
your
uncle
has
deposited
his
wealth
in
a
bank
and
has
written
a
cheque
for
the
amount
leaving
it
between
two
leaves
of
a
book
is
possible
monsieur
but
i
think
that
highly
improbable
i
have
gone
through
every
tome
page
by
page
and
i
suspect
very
few
of
the
volumes
have
been
opened
for
the
last
twenty
years
much
money
do
you
estimate
he
accumulated
must
have
cleared
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
but
speaking
of
banking
it
i
would
like
to
say
that
my
uncle
evinced
a
deep
distrust
of
banks
and
never
drew
a
cheque
in
his
life
so
far
as
i
am
aware
all
accounts
were
paid
in
gold
by
this
old
steward
who
first
brought
the
receipted
bill
in
to
my
uncle
and
then
received
the
exact
amount
after
having
left
the
room
and
waited
until
he
was
rung
for
so
that
he
might
not
learn
the
repository
from
which
my
uncle
drew
his
store
i
believe
if
the
money
is
ever
found
it
will
be
in
gold
and
i
am
very
sure
that
this
will
was
written
if
we
may
call
it
a
will
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent
you
had
the
library
cleared
out
no
it
is
practically
as
my
uncle
left
it
i
realised
that
if
i
were
to
call
in
help
it
would
be
well
that
the
newcomer
found
it
undisturbed
were
quite
right
my
lord
you
say
you
examined
all
the
papers
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
the
room
has
been
very
fairly
gone
over
but
nothing
that
was
in
it
the
day
my
uncle
died
has
been
removed
not
even
his
anvil
anvil
i
told
you
he
made
a
blacksmith
shop
as
well
as
bedroom
of
the
library
it
is
a
huge
room
with
a
great
fireplace
at
one
end
which
formed
an
excellent
forge
he
and
the
steward
built
the
forge
in
the
eastern
fireplace
of
brick
and
clay
with
their
own
hands
and
erected
there
a
blacksmith
bellows
work
did
he
do
at
his
forge
anything
that
was
required
about
the
place
he
seems
to
have
been
a
very
expert
ironworker
he
would
never
buy
a
new
implement
for
the
garden
or
the
house
so
long
as
he
could
get
one
and
he
never
bought
anything
while
at
his
forge
he
might
repair
what
was
already
in
use
he
kept
an
old
cob
on
which
he
used
to
ride
through
the
park
and
he
always
put
the
shoes
on
this
cob
himself
the
steward
informs
me
so
he
must
have
understood
the
use
of
tools
he
made
a
carpenter
shop
of
the
chief
and
erected
a
bench
there
i
think
a
very
useful
mechanic
was
spoiled
when
my
uncle
became
an
earl
have
been
living
at
the
chase
since
your
uncle
died
you
call
it
living
yes
the
old
steward
and
his
wife
have
been
looking
after
me
as
they
looked
after
my
uncle
and
seeing
me
day
after
day
coatless
and
covered
with
dust
i
imagine
they
think
me
a
second
edition
of
the
old
man
the
steward
know
the
money
is
missing
no
one
knows
it
but
myself
this
will
was
left
on
the
anvil
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
statement
is
exceedingly
clear
lord
chizelrigg
but
i
confess
i
do
see
much
daylight
through
it
is
there
a
pleasant
country
around
chizelrigg
chase
especially
at
this
season
of
the
year
in
autumn
and
winter
the
house
is
a
little
draughty
it
needs
several
thousand
pounds
to
put
it
in
repair
do
not
matter
in
the
summer
i
have
been
long
enough
in
england
not
to
share
the
fear
of
my
countrymen
for
a
is
there
a
spare
bed
in
the
manor
house
or
shall
i
take
down
a
cot
with
me
or
let
us
say
a
hammock
stammered
the
earl
blushing
again
must
not
think
i
detailed
all
these
circumstances
in
order
to
influence
you
to
take
up
what
may
be
a
hopeless
case
i
of
course
am
deeply
interested
and
therefore
somewhat
prone
to
be
carried
away
when
i
begin
a
recital
of
my
uncle
eccentricities
if
i
receive
your
permission
i
will
call
on
you
again
in
a
month
or
two
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
borrowed
a
little
money
from
the
old
steward
and
visited
london
to
see
my
legal
advisers
hoping
that
in
the
circumstances
i
may
get
permission
to
sell
something
that
will
keep
me
from
starvation
when
i
spoke
of
the
house
being
denuded
i
meant
relatively
of
course
there
are
still
a
good
many
antiquities
which
would
doubtless
bring
me
in
a
comfortable
sum
of
money
i
have
been
borne
up
by
the
belief
that
i
should
find
my
uncle
gold
lately
i
have
been
beset
by
a
suspicion
that
the
old
gentleman
thought
the
library
the
only
valuable
asset
left
and
for
this
reason
wrote
his
note
thinking
i
would
be
afraid
to
sell
anything
from
that
room
the
old
rascal
must
have
made
a
pot
of
money
out
of
those
shelves
the
catalogue
shows
that
there
was
a
copy
of
the
first
book
printed
in
england
by
caxton
and
several
priceless
shakespeares
as
well
as
many
other
volumes
that
a
collector
would
give
a
small
fortune
for
all
these
are
gone
i
think
when
i
show
this
to
be
the
case
the
authorities
can
not
refuse
me
the
right
to
sell
something
and
if
i
get
this
permission
i
shall
at
once
call
upon
you
lord
chizelrigg
put
your
application
in
motion
if
you
like
meanwhile
i
beg
of
you
to
look
upon
me
as
a
more
substantial
banker
than
your
old
steward
let
us
enjoy
a
good
dinner
together
at
the
cecil
tonight
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
be
my
guest
tomorrow
we
can
leave
for
chizelrigg
chase
how
far
is
it
three
hours
replied
the
young
man
becoming
as
red
as
a
new
queen
anne
villa
monsieur
valmont
you
overwhelm
me
with
your
kindness
but
nevertheless
i
accept
your
generous
offer
that
settled
what
the
name
of
the
old
steward
are
certain
he
has
no
knowledge
of
the
of
this
treasure
quite
sure
my
uncle
was
not
a
man
to
make
a
confidant
of
anyone
least
of
all
an
old
babbler
like
higgins
i
should
like
to
be
introduced
to
higgins
as
a
benighted
foreigner
that
will
make
him
despise
me
and
treat
me
like
a
child
i
say
protested
the
earl
should
have
thought
you
lived
long
enough
in
england
to
have
got
out
of
the
notion
that
we
do
not
appreciate
the
foreigner
indeed
we
are
the
only
nation
in
the
world
that
extends
a
cordial
welcome
to
him
rich
or
poor
my
lord
i
should
be
deeply
disappointed
did
you
not
take
me
at
my
proper
valuation
but
i
cherish
no
delusions
regarding
the
contempt
with
which
higgins
will
regard
me
he
will
look
upon
me
as
a
sort
of
simpleton
to
whom
the
lord
had
been
unkind
by
not
making
england
my
native
land
now
higgins
must
be
led
to
believe
that
i
am
in
his
own
class
that
is
a
servant
of
yours
higgins
and
i
will
gossip
over
the
fire
together
should
these
spring
evenings
prove
chilly
and
before
two
or
three
weeks
are
past
i
shall
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
your
uncle
that
you
never
dreamed
of
higgins
will
talk
more
freely
with
a
than
with
his
master
however
much
he
may
respect
that
master
and
then
as
i
am
a
foreigner
he
will
babble
down
to
my
comprehension
and
i
shall
get
details
that
he
never
would
think
of
giving
to
a
the
young
earl
modesty
in
such
description
of
his
home
as
he
had
given
me
left
me
totally
unprepared
for
the
grandeur
of
the
mansion
one
corner
of
which
he
inhabited
it
is
such
a
place
as
you
read
of
in
romances
of
the
middle
ages
not
a
pinnacled
or
turreted
french
château
of
that
period
but
a
beautiful
and
substantial
stone
manor
house
of
a
ruddy
colour
whose
warm
hue
seemed
to
add
a
softness
to
the
severity
of
its
architecture
it
is
built
round
an
outer
and
an
inner
courtyard
and
could
house
a
thousand
rather
than
the
hundred
with
which
its
owner
had
accredited
it
there
are
many
windows
and
one
at
the
end
of
the
library
might
well
have
graced
a
cathedral
this
superb
residence
occupies
the
centre
of
a
heavily
timbered
park
and
from
the
lodge
at
the
gates
we
drove
at
least
a
mile
and
a
half
under
the
grandest
avenue
of
old
oaks
i
have
ever
seen
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
owner
of
all
this
should
actually
lack
the
ready
money
to
pay
his
fare
to
town
old
higgins
met
us
at
the
station
with
a
somewhat
rickety
cart
to
which
was
attached
the
ancient
cob
that
the
late
earl
used
to
shoe
we
entered
a
noble
hall
which
probably
looked
the
larger
because
of
the
entire
absence
of
any
kind
of
furniture
unless
two
complete
suits
of
venerable
armour
which
stood
on
either
hand
might
be
considered
as
furnishing
i
laughed
aloud
when
the
door
was
shut
and
the
sound
echoed
like
the
merriment
of
ghosts
from
the
dim
timbered
roof
above
me
are
you
laughing
at
asked
the
earl
am
laughing
to
see
you
put
your
modern
tall
hat
on
that
mediaeval
helmet
that
it
well
put
yours
on
the
other
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
the
ancestor
who
wore
this
suit
but
we
are
short
of
the
harmless
necessary
so
i
put
my
topper
on
the
antique
helmet
and
thrust
the
umbrella
if
i
have
one
in
behind
here
and
down
one
of
his
legs
since
i
came
in
possession
a
very
dealer
from
london
visited
me
and
attempted
to
sound
me
regarding
the
sale
of
these
suits
of
armour
i
gathered
he
would
give
enough
money
to
keep
me
in
new
suits
london
made
for
the
rest
of
my
life
but
when
i
endeavoured
to
find
out
if
he
had
had
commercial
dealings
with
my
prophetic
uncle
he
became
frightened
and
bolted
i
imagine
that
if
i
had
possessed
presence
of
mind
enough
to
have
lured
him
into
one
of
our
most
uncomfortable
dungeons
i
might
have
learned
where
some
of
the
family
treasures
went
to
come
up
these
stairs
monsieur
valmont
and
i
will
show
you
your
room
we
had
lunched
on
the
train
coming
down
so
after
a
wash
in
my
own
room
i
proceeded
at
once
to
inspect
the
library
it
proved
indeed
a
most
noble
apartment
and
it
had
been
scandalously
used
by
the
old
reprobate
its
late
tenant
there
were
two
huge
fireplaces
one
in
the
middle
of
the
north
wall
and
the
other
at
the
eastern
end
in
the
latter
had
been
erected
a
rude
brick
forge
and
beside
the
forge
hung
a
great
black
bellows
smoky
with
usage
on
a
wooden
block
lay
the
anvil
and
around
it
rested
and
rusted
several
hammers
large
and
small
at
the
western
end
was
a
glorious
window
filled
with
ancient
stained
glass
which
as
i
have
said
might
have
adorned
a
cathedral
extensive
as
the
collection
of
books
was
the
great
size
of
this
chamber
made
it
necessary
that
only
the
outside
wall
should
be
covered
with
book
cases
and
even
these
were
divided
by
tall
windows
the
opposite
wall
was
blank
with
the
exception
of
a
picture
here
and
there
and
these
pictures
offered
a
further
insult
to
the
room
for
they
were
cheap
prints
mostly
coloured
lithographs
that
had
appeared
in
christmas
numbers
of
london
weekly
journals
encased
in
frames
hanging
from
nails
ruthlessly
driven
in
above
them
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
litter
of
papers
in
some
places
and
in
the
corner
farthest
from
the
forge
still
stood
the
bed
on
which
the
ancient
miser
had
died
like
a
stable
does
it
commented
the
earl
when
i
had
finished
my
inspection
am
sure
the
old
boy
simply
filled
it
up
with
this
rubbish
to
give
me
the
trouble
of
examining
it
higgins
tells
me
that
up
to
within
a
month
before
he
died
the
room
was
reasonably
clear
of
all
this
muck
of
course
it
had
to
be
or
the
place
would
have
caught
fire
from
the
sparks
of
the
forge
the
old
man
made
higgins
gather
all
the
papers
he
could
find
anywhere
about
the
place
ancient
accounts
newspapers
and
what
not
even
to
the
brown
wrapping
paper
you
see
in
which
parcels
came
and
commanded
him
to
strew
the
floor
with
this
litter
because
as
he
complained
boots
on
the
boards
made
too
much
noise
and
higgins
who
is
not
in
the
least
of
an
inquiring
mind
accepted
this
explanation
as
entirely
meeting
the
case
higgins
proved
to
be
a
garrulous
old
fellow
who
needed
no
urging
to
talk
about
the
late
earl
indeed
it
was
almost
impossible
to
deflect
his
conversation
into
any
other
channel
twenty
years
intimacy
with
the
eccentric
nobleman
had
largely
obliterated
that
sense
of
deference
with
which
an
english
servant
usually
approaches
his
master
an
english
underling
idea
of
nobility
is
the
man
who
never
by
any
possibility
works
with
his
hands
the
fact
that
lord
chizelrigg
had
toiled
at
the
carpenter
bench
had
mixed
cement
in
the
had
caused
the
anvil
to
ring
out
till
midnight
aroused
no
admiration
in
higgins
mind
in
addition
to
this
the
ancient
nobleman
had
been
penuriously
strict
in
his
examination
of
accounts
exacting
the
uttermost
farthing
so
the
humble
servitor
regarded
his
memory
with
supreme
contempt
i
realised
before
the
drive
was
finished
from
the
station
to
chizelrigg
chase
that
there
was
little
use
of
introducing
me
to
higgins
as
a
foreigner
and
a
i
found
myself
completely
unable
to
understand
what
the
old
fellow
said
his
dialect
was
as
unknown
to
me
as
the
choctaw
language
would
have
been
and
the
young
earl
was
compelled
to
act
as
interpreter
on
the
occasions
when
we
set
this
garrulous
going
the
new
earl
of
chizelrigg
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
boy
proclaimed
himself
my
pupil
and
assistant
and
said
he
would
do
whatever
he
was
told
his
thorough
and
fruitless
search
of
the
library
had
convinced
him
that
the
old
man
was
merely
chaffing
him
as
he
put
it
by
leaving
such
a
letter
as
he
had
written
his
lordship
was
certain
that
the
money
had
been
hidden
somewhere
else
probably
buried
under
one
of
the
trees
in
the
park
of
course
this
was
possible
and
represented
the
usual
method
by
which
a
stupid
person
conceals
treasure
yet
i
did
not
think
it
probable
all
conversations
with
higgins
showed
the
earl
to
have
been
an
extremely
suspicious
man
suspicious
of
banks
suspicious
even
of
bank
of
england
notes
suspicious
of
every
person
on
earth
not
omitting
higgins
himself
therefore
as
i
told
his
nephew
the
miser
would
never
allow
the
fortune
out
of
his
sight
and
immediate
reach
from
the
first
the
oddity
of
the
forge
and
anvil
being
placed
in
his
bedroom
struck
me
as
peculiar
and
i
said
to
the
young
man
stake
my
reputation
that
forge
or
anvil
or
both
contain
the
secret
you
see
the
old
gentleman
worked
sometimes
till
midnight
for
higgins
could
hear
his
hammering
if
he
used
hard
coal
on
the
forge
the
fire
would
last
through
the
night
and
being
in
continual
terror
of
thieves
as
higgins
says
barricading
the
castle
every
evening
before
dark
as
if
it
were
a
fortress
he
was
bound
to
place
the
treasure
in
the
most
unlikely
spot
for
a
thief
to
get
at
it
now
the
coal
fire
smouldered
all
night
long
and
if
the
gold
was
in
the
forge
underneath
the
embers
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
get
at
a
robber
rummaging
in
the
dark
would
burn
his
fingers
in
more
senses
than
one
then
as
his
lordship
kept
no
less
than
four
loaded
revolvers
under
his
pillow
all
he
had
to
do
if
a
thief
entered
his
room
was
to
allow
the
search
to
go
on
until
the
thief
started
at
the
forge
then
doubtless
as
he
had
the
range
with
reasonable
accuracy
night
or
day
he
might
sit
up
in
bed
and
blaze
away
with
revolver
after
revolver
there
were
shots
that
could
be
fired
in
about
double
as
many
seconds
so
you
see
the
robber
stood
little
chance
in
the
face
of
such
a
fusillade
i
propose
that
we
dismantle
the
forge
lord
chizelrigg
was
much
taken
by
my
reasoning
and
one
morning
early
we
cut
down
the
big
bellows
tore
it
open
found
it
empty
then
took
brick
after
brick
from
the
forge
with
a
crowbar
for
the
old
man
had
builded
better
than
he
knew
with
portland
cement
in
fact
when
we
cleared
away
the
rubbish
between
the
bricks
and
the
core
of
the
furnace
we
came
upon
one
cube
of
cement
which
was
as
hard
as
granite
with
the
aid
of
higgins
and
a
set
of
rollers
and
levers
we
managed
to
get
this
block
out
into
the
park
and
attempted
to
crush
it
with
the
belonging
to
the
forge
in
which
we
were
entirely
unsuccessful
the
more
it
resisted
our
efforts
the
more
certain
we
became
that
the
coins
would
be
found
within
it
as
this
would
not
be
in
the
sense
that
the
government
might
make
a
claim
upon
it
there
was
no
particular
necessity
for
secrecy
so
we
had
up
a
man
from
the
mines
near
by
with
drills
and
dynamite
who
speedily
shattered
the
block
into
a
million
pieces
more
or
less
alas
there
was
no
trace
in
its
debris
of
dirt
as
the
western
miner
puts
it
while
the
dynamite
expert
was
on
the
spot
we
induced
him
to
shatter
the
anvil
as
well
as
the
block
of
cement
and
then
the
workman
doubtless
thinking
the
new
earl
was
as
insane
as
the
old
one
had
been
shouldered
his
tools
and
went
back
to
his
mine
the
earl
reverted
to
his
former
opinion
that
the
gold
was
concealed
in
the
park
while
i
held
even
more
firmly
to
my
own
belief
that
the
fortune
rested
in
the
library
is
obvious
i
said
to
him
if
the
treasure
is
buried
outside
someone
must
have
dug
the
hole
a
man
so
timorous
and
so
reticent
as
your
uncle
would
allow
no
one
to
do
this
but
himself
higgins
maintained
the
other
evening
that
all
picks
and
spades
were
safely
locked
up
by
himself
each
night
in
the
the
mansion
itself
was
barricaded
with
such
exceeding
care
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
your
uncle
to
get
outside
even
if
he
wished
to
do
so
then
such
a
man
as
your
uncle
is
described
to
have
been
would
continually
desire
ocular
demonstration
that
his
savings
were
intact
which
would
be
practically
impossible
if
the
gold
had
found
a
grave
in
the
park
i
propose
now
that
we
abandon
violence
and
dynamite
and
proceed
to
an
intellectual
search
of
the
library
well
replied
the
young
earl
as
i
have
already
searched
the
library
very
thoroughly
your
use
of
the
word
intellectual
monsieur
valmont
is
not
in
accord
with
your
customary
politeness
however
i
am
with
you
is
for
you
to
command
and
me
to
obey
me
my
lord
i
said
used
the
word
intellectual
in
contradistinction
to
the
word
dynamite
it
had
no
reference
to
your
former
search
i
merely
propose
that
we
now
abandon
the
use
of
chemical
reaction
and
employ
the
much
greater
force
of
mental
activity
did
you
notice
any
writing
on
the
margins
of
the
newspapers
you
examined
i
did
not
it
possible
that
there
may
have
been
some
communication
on
the
white
border
of
a
newspaper
is
of
course
possible
will
you
set
yourself
to
the
task
of
glancing
over
the
margin
of
every
newspaper
piling
them
away
in
another
room
when
your
scrutiny
of
each
is
complete
do
not
destroy
anything
but
we
must
clear
out
the
library
completely
i
am
interested
in
the
accounts
and
will
examine
them
it
was
exasperatingly
tedious
work
but
after
several
days
my
assistant
reported
every
margin
scanned
without
result
while
i
had
collected
each
bill
and
memorandum
classifying
them
according
to
date
i
could
not
get
rid
of
a
suspicion
that
the
contrary
old
beast
had
written
instructions
for
the
finding
of
the
treasure
on
the
back
of
some
account
or
on
the
of
a
book
and
as
i
looked
at
the
thousands
of
volumes
still
left
in
the
library
the
prospect
of
such
a
patient
and
minute
search
appalled
me
but
i
remembered
edison
words
to
the
effect
that
if
a
thing
exist
search
exhaustive
enough
will
find
it
from
the
mass
of
accounts
i
selected
several
the
rest
i
placed
in
another
room
alongside
the
heap
of
the
earl
newspapers
said
i
to
my
helper
it
please
you
we
will
have
higgins
in
as
i
wish
some
explanation
of
these
accounts
i
can
assist
you
suggested
his
lordship
drawing
up
a
chair
opposite
the
table
on
which
i
had
spread
the
statements
have
lived
here
for
six
months
and
know
as
much
about
things
as
higgins
does
he
is
so
difficult
to
stop
when
once
he
begins
to
talk
what
is
the
first
account
you
wish
further
light
upon
go
back
thirteen
years
i
find
that
your
uncle
bought
a
safe
in
sheffield
here
is
the
bill
i
consider
it
necessary
to
find
that
safe
forgive
me
monsieur
valmont
cried
the
young
man
springing
to
his
feet
and
laughing
heavy
an
article
as
a
safe
should
not
slip
readily
from
a
man
memory
but
it
did
from
mine
the
safe
is
empty
and
i
gave
no
more
thought
to
it
saying
this
the
earl
went
to
one
of
the
bookcases
that
stood
against
the
wall
pulled
it
round
as
if
it
were
a
door
books
and
all
and
displayed
the
front
of
an
iron
safe
the
door
of
which
he
also
drew
open
exhibiting
the
usual
empty
interior
of
such
a
receptacle
came
on
this
he
said
i
took
down
all
these
volumes
it
appears
that
there
was
once
a
secret
door
leading
from
the
library
into
an
outside
room
which
has
long
since
disappeared
the
walls
are
very
thick
my
uncle
doubtless
caused
this
door
to
be
taken
off
its
hinges
and
the
safe
placed
in
the
aperture
the
rest
of
which
he
then
bricked
up
so
said
i
endeavouring
to
conceal
my
disappointment
this
strong
box
was
bought
and
not
made
to
order
i
suppose
there
can
be
no
secret
crannies
in
it
looks
like
a
common
or
garden
safe
reported
my
assistant
we
have
it
out
if
you
say
so
just
now
i
replied
had
enough
of
dynamiting
to
make
us
feel
like
housebreakers
already
agree
with
you
what
the
next
item
on
the
programme
uncle
mania
for
buying
things
at
was
broken
in
three
instances
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
from
a
scrutiny
of
these
accounts
about
four
years
ago
he
purchased
a
new
book
from
denny
and
the
booksellers
of
the
strand
denny
and
deal
only
in
new
books
is
there
any
comparatively
new
volume
in
the
library
one
you
sure
of
that
quite
i
searched
all
the
literature
in
the
house
what
is
the
name
of
the
volume
he
bought
i
can
not
decipher
the
initial
letter
looks
like
m
but
the
rest
is
a
mere
wavy
line
i
see
however
that
it
cost
while
the
cost
of
carriage
by
parcel
post
was
sixpence
which
shows
it
weighed
something
under
four
pounds
this
with
the
price
of
the
book
induces
me
to
think
that
it
was
a
scientific
work
printed
on
heavy
paper
and
illustrated
know
nothing
of
it
said
the
earl
third
account
is
for
wallpaper
rolls
of
an
expensive
wallpaper
and
rolls
of
a
cheap
paper
the
latter
being
just
half
the
price
of
the
former
this
wallpaper
seems
to
have
been
supplied
by
a
tradesman
in
the
station
road
in
the
village
of
chizelrigg
your
wallpaper
cried
the
youth
waving
his
hand
was
going
to
paper
the
whole
house
higgins
told
me
but
got
tired
after
he
had
finished
the
library
which
took
him
nearly
a
year
to
accomplish
for
he
worked
at
it
very
intermittently
mixing
the
paste
in
the
boudoir
a
pailful
at
a
time
as
he
needed
it
it
was
a
scandalous
thing
to
do
for
underneath
the
paper
is
the
most
exquisite
oak
panelling
very
plain
but
very
rich
in
colour
i
rose
and
examined
the
paper
on
the
wall
it
was
dark
brown
and
answered
the
description
of
the
expensive
paper
on
the
bill
became
of
the
cheap
paper
i
asked
do
know
think
said
i
are
on
the
track
of
the
mystery
i
believe
that
paper
covers
a
sliding
panel
or
concealed
door
is
very
likely
replied
the
earl
intended
to
have
the
paper
off
but
i
had
no
money
to
pay
a
workman
and
i
am
not
so
industrious
as
was
my
uncle
what
is
your
remaining
account
last
also
pertains
to
paper
but
comes
from
a
firm
in
budge
row
london
he
has
had
it
seems
a
thousand
sheets
of
it
and
it
appears
to
have
been
frightfully
expensive
this
bill
is
also
illegible
but
i
take
it
a
thousand
sheets
were
supplied
although
of
course
it
may
have
been
a
thousand
quires
which
would
be
a
little
more
reasonable
for
the
price
charged
or
a
thousand
reams
which
would
be
exceedingly
cheap
do
know
anything
about
that
let
turn
on
higgins
higgins
knew
nothing
of
this
last
order
of
paper
either
the
wallpaper
mystery
he
at
once
cleared
up
apparently
the
old
earl
had
discovered
by
experiment
that
the
heavy
expensive
wallpaper
would
not
stick
to
the
glossy
panelling
so
he
had
purchased
a
cheaper
paper
and
had
pasted
that
on
first
higgins
said
he
had
gone
all
over
the
panelling
with
a
paper
and
after
that
was
dry
he
pasted
over
it
the
more
expensive
rolls
i
objected
two
papers
were
bought
and
delivered
at
the
same
time
therefore
he
could
not
have
found
by
experiment
that
the
heavy
paper
would
not
stick
do
think
there
is
much
in
that
commented
the
earl
heavy
paper
may
have
been
bought
first
and
found
to
be
unsuitable
and
then
the
coarse
cheap
paper
bought
afterwards
the
bill
merely
shows
that
the
account
was
sent
in
on
that
date
indeed
as
the
village
of
chizelrigg
is
but
a
few
miles
away
it
would
have
been
quite
possible
for
my
uncle
to
have
bought
the
heavy
paper
in
the
morning
tried
it
and
in
the
afternoon
sent
for
the
commoner
lot
but
in
any
case
the
bill
would
not
have
been
presented
until
months
after
the
order
and
the
two
purchases
were
thus
lumped
together
i
was
forced
to
confess
that
this
seemed
reasonable
now
about
the
book
ordered
from
denny
did
higgins
remember
anything
regarding
it
it
came
four
years
ago
ah
yes
higgins
did
he
remembered
it
very
well
indeed
he
had
come
in
one
morning
with
the
earl
tea
and
the
old
man
was
sitting
up
in
bed
reading
his
volume
with
such
interest
that
he
was
unaware
of
higgins
knock
and
higgins
himself
being
a
little
hard
of
hearing
took
for
granted
the
command
to
enter
the
earl
hastily
thrust
the
book
under
the
pillow
alongside
the
revolvers
and
rated
higgins
in
a
most
cruel
way
for
entering
the
room
before
getting
permission
to
do
so
he
had
never
seen
the
earl
so
angry
before
and
he
laid
it
all
to
this
book
it
was
after
the
book
had
come
that
the
forge
had
been
erected
and
the
anvil
bought
higgins
never
saw
the
book
again
but
one
morning
six
months
before
the
earl
died
higgins
in
raking
out
the
cinders
of
the
forge
found
what
he
supposed
was
a
portion
of
the
book
cover
he
believed
his
master
had
burnt
the
volume
having
dismissed
higgins
i
said
to
the
earl
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
enclose
this
bill
to
denny
and
booksellers
strand
tell
them
you
have
lost
the
volume
and
ask
them
to
send
another
there
is
likely
someone
in
the
shop
who
can
decipher
the
illegible
writing
i
am
certain
the
book
will
give
us
a
clue
now
i
shall
write
to
braun
and
sons
budge
row
this
is
evidently
a
french
company
in
fact
the
name
as
connected
with
runs
in
my
mind
although
i
can
not
at
this
moment
place
it
i
shall
ask
them
the
use
of
this
paper
that
they
furnished
to
the
late
earl
this
was
done
accordingly
and
now
as
we
thought
until
the
answers
came
we
were
two
men
out
of
work
yet
the
next
morning
i
am
pleased
to
say
and
i
have
always
rather
plumed
myself
on
the
fact
i
solved
the
mystery
before
replies
were
received
from
london
of
course
both
the
book
and
the
answer
of
the
paper
agents
by
putting
two
and
two
together
would
have
given
us
the
key
after
breakfast
i
strolled
somewhat
aimlessly
into
the
library
whose
floor
was
now
strewn
merely
with
brown
wrapping
paper
bits
of
string
and
all
that
as
i
shuffled
among
this
with
my
feet
as
if
tossing
aside
dead
autumn
leaves
in
a
forest
path
my
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
several
squares
of
paper
unwrinkled
and
never
used
for
wrapping
these
sheets
seemed
to
me
strangely
familiar
i
picked
one
of
them
up
and
at
once
the
significance
of
the
name
braun
and
sons
occurred
to
me
they
are
paper
makers
in
france
who
produce
a
smooth
very
tough
sheet
which
dear
as
it
is
proves
infinitely
cheap
compared
with
the
fine
vellum
it
deposed
in
a
certain
branch
of
industry
in
paris
years
before
these
sheets
had
given
me
the
knowledge
of
how
a
gang
of
thieves
disposed
of
their
gold
without
melting
it
the
paper
was
used
instead
of
vellum
in
the
rougher
processes
of
manufacturing
it
stood
the
constant
beating
of
the
hammer
nearly
as
well
as
the
vellum
and
here
at
once
there
flashed
on
me
the
secret
of
the
old
man
midnight
anvil
work
he
was
transforming
his
sovereigns
into
which
must
have
been
of
a
rude
thick
kind
because
to
produce
the
of
commerce
he
still
needed
the
vellum
as
well
as
a
and
other
machinery
of
which
we
had
found
no
trace
lord
i
called
to
my
assistant
he
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
wish
to
test
a
theory
on
the
anvil
of
your
own
fresh
common
sense
away
replied
the
earl
approaching
me
with
his
usual
jocular
expression
eliminate
the
safe
from
our
investigations
because
it
was
purchased
thirteen
years
ago
but
the
buying
of
the
book
of
wall
covering
of
this
tough
paper
from
france
all
group
themselves
into
a
set
of
incidents
occurring
within
the
same
month
as
the
purchase
of
the
anvil
and
the
building
of
the
forge
therefore
i
think
they
are
related
to
one
another
here
are
some
sheets
of
paper
he
got
from
budge
row
have
you
ever
seen
anything
like
it
try
to
tear
this
sample
reasonably
tough
admitted
his
lordship
fruitlessly
endeavouring
to
rip
it
apart
it
was
made
in
france
and
is
used
in
gold
beating
your
uncle
beat
his
sovereigns
into
you
will
find
that
the
book
from
denny
is
a
volume
on
gold
beating
and
now
as
i
remember
that
scribbled
word
which
i
could
not
make
out
i
think
the
title
of
the
volume
is
metallurgy
it
contains
no
doubt
a
chapter
on
the
manufacture
of
believe
you
said
the
earl
i
do
see
that
the
discovery
sets
us
any
further
forward
we
now
looking
for
instead
of
sovereigns
examine
this
wallpaper
said
i
placed
my
knife
under
a
corner
of
it
at
the
floor
and
quite
easily
ripped
off
a
large
section
as
higgins
had
said
the
brown
paper
was
on
top
and
the
coarse
paper
underneath
but
even
that
came
away
from
the
oak
panelling
as
easily
as
though
it
hung
there
from
habit
and
not
because
of
paste
the
weight
of
that
i
cried
handing
him
the
sheet
i
had
torn
from
the
wall
jove
said
the
earl
in
a
voice
almost
of
awe
i
took
it
from
him
and
laid
it
face
downwards
on
the
wooden
table
threw
a
little
water
on
the
back
and
with
a
knife
scraped
away
the
porous
white
paper
instantly
there
gleamed
up
at
us
the
baleful
yellow
of
the
gold
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
spread
out
my
hands
the
earl
of
chizelrigg
laughed
aloud
and
very
heartily
see
how
it
is
i
cried
old
man
first
covered
the
entire
wall
with
this
whitish
paper
he
heated
his
sovereigns
at
the
forge
and
beat
them
out
on
the
anvil
then
completed
the
process
rudely
between
the
sheets
of
this
paper
from
france
probably
he
pasted
the
gold
to
the
wall
as
soon
as
he
shut
himself
in
for
the
night
and
covered
it
over
with
the
more
expensive
paper
before
higgins
entered
in
the
morning
we
found
afterwards
however
that
he
had
actually
fastened
the
thick
sheets
of
gold
to
the
wall
with
carpet
tacks
his
lordship
netted
a
trifle
over
a
hundred
and
thousand
pounds
through
my
discovery
and
i
am
pleased
to
pay
tribute
to
the
young
man
generosity
by
saying
that
his
voluntary
settlement
made
my
bank
account
swell
stout
as
a
city
alderman
some
years
ago
i
enjoyed
the
unique
experience
of
pursuing
a
man
for
one
crime
and
getting
evidence
against
him
of
another
he
was
innocent
of
the
misdemeanour
the
proof
of
which
i
sought
but
was
guilty
of
another
most
serious
offence
yet
he
and
his
confederates
escaped
in
circumstances
which
i
now
purpose
to
relate
you
may
remember
that
in
rudyard
kipling
story
the
unfortunate
woman
husband
ran
the
risk
of
being
arrested
as
a
simple
drunkard
at
a
moment
when
the
blood
of
murder
was
upon
his
boots
the
case
of
ralph
summertrees
was
rather
the
reverse
of
this
the
english
authorities
were
trying
to
fasten
upon
him
a
crime
almost
as
important
as
murder
while
i
was
collecting
evidence
which
proved
him
guilty
of
an
action
much
more
momentous
than
that
of
drunkenness
the
english
authorities
have
always
been
good
enough
when
they
recognise
my
existence
at
all
to
look
down
upon
me
with
amused
condescension
if
today
you
ask
spenser
hale
of
scotland
yard
what
he
thinks
of
eugène
valmont
that
complacent
man
will
put
on
the
superior
smile
which
so
well
becomes
him
and
if
you
are
a
very
intimate
friend
of
his
he
may
draw
down
the
lid
of
his
right
eye
as
he
replies
yes
a
very
decent
fellow
valmont
but
he
a
frenchman
as
if
that
said
there
was
no
need
of
further
inquiry
myself
i
like
the
english
detective
very
much
and
if
i
were
to
be
in
a
tomorrow
there
is
no
man
i
would
rather
find
beside
me
than
spenser
hale
in
any
situation
where
a
fist
that
can
fell
an
ox
is
desirable
my
friend
hale
is
a
useful
companion
but
for
intellectuality
mental
acumen
finesse
ah
well
i
am
the
most
modest
of
men
and
will
say
nothing
it
would
amuse
you
to
see
this
giant
come
into
my
room
during
an
evening
on
the
bluff
pretence
that
he
wishes
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
me
there
is
the
same
difference
between
this
giant
and
myself
as
exists
between
that
strong
black
pipe
of
his
and
my
delicate
cigarette
which
i
smoke
feverishly
when
he
is
present
to
protect
myself
from
the
fumes
of
his
terrible
tobacco
i
look
with
delight
upon
the
huge
man
who
with
an
air
of
the
utmost
good
humour
and
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
he
thinks
he
is
twisting
me
about
his
finger
vainly
endeavours
to
obtain
a
hint
regarding
whatever
case
is
perplexing
him
at
that
moment
i
baffle
him
with
the
ease
that
an
active
greyhound
eludes
the
pursuit
of
a
heavy
mastiff
then
at
last
i
say
to
him
with
a
laugh
hale
tell
me
all
about
it
and
i
will
help
you
if
i
can
once
or
twice
at
the
beginning
he
shook
his
massive
head
and
replied
the
secret
was
not
his
the
last
time
he
did
this
i
assured
him
that
what
he
said
was
quite
correct
and
then
i
related
full
particulars
of
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
excepting
the
names
for
these
he
had
not
mentioned
i
had
pieced
together
his
perplexity
from
scraps
of
conversation
in
his
fishing
for
my
advice
which
of
course
he
could
have
had
for
the
plain
asking
since
that
time
he
has
not
come
to
me
except
with
cases
he
feels
at
liberty
to
reveal
and
one
or
two
complications
i
have
happily
been
enabled
to
unravel
for
him
but
staunch
as
spenser
hale
holds
the
belief
that
no
detective
service
on
earth
can
excel
that
centring
in
scotland
yard
there
is
one
department
of
activity
in
which
even
he
confesses
that
frenchmen
are
his
masters
although
he
somewhat
grudgingly
qualifies
his
admission
by
adding
that
we
in
france
are
constantly
allowed
to
do
what
is
prohibited
in
england
i
refer
to
the
minute
search
of
a
house
during
the
owner
absence
if
you
read
that
excellent
story
entitled
purloined
by
edgar
allan
poe
you
will
find
a
record
of
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
which
is
better
than
any
description
i
who
have
so
often
taken
part
in
such
a
search
can
set
down
now
these
people
among
whom
i
live
are
proud
of
their
phrase
englishman
house
is
his
castle
and
into
that
castle
even
a
policeman
can
not
penetrate
without
a
legal
warrant
this
may
be
all
very
well
in
theory
but
if
you
are
compelled
to
march
up
to
a
house
blowing
a
trumpet
and
rattling
a
snare
drum
you
need
not
be
disappointed
if
you
fail
to
find
what
you
are
in
search
of
when
all
the
legal
restrictions
are
complied
with
of
course
the
english
are
a
very
excellent
people
a
fact
to
which
i
am
always
proud
to
bear
testimony
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
for
cold
common
sense
the
french
are
very
much
their
superiors
in
paris
if
i
wish
to
obtain
an
incriminating
document
i
do
not
send
the
possessor
a
to
inform
him
of
my
desire
and
in
this
procedure
the
french
people
sanely
acquiesce
i
have
known
men
who
when
they
go
out
to
spend
an
evening
on
the
boulevards
toss
their
bunch
of
keys
to
the
concierge
saying
you
hear
the
police
rummaging
about
while
i
away
pray
assist
them
with
an
expression
of
my
distinguished
consideration
i
remember
while
i
was
chief
detective
in
the
service
of
the
french
government
being
requested
to
call
at
a
certain
hour
at
the
private
hotel
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
it
was
during
the
time
that
bismarck
meditated
a
second
attack
upon
my
country
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
was
then
instrumental
in
supplying
the
secret
bureau
with
documents
which
mollified
that
iron
man
purpose
a
fact
which
i
think
entitled
me
to
my
country
gratitude
not
that
i
ever
even
hinted
such
a
claim
when
a
succeeding
ministry
forgot
my
services
the
memory
of
a
republic
as
has
been
said
by
a
greater
man
than
i
is
short
however
all
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
incident
i
am
about
to
relate
i
merely
mention
the
crisis
to
excuse
a
momentary
forgetfulness
on
my
part
which
in
any
other
country
might
have
been
followed
by
serious
results
to
myself
but
in
france
ah
we
understand
those
things
and
nothing
happened
i
am
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
give
myself
away
as
they
say
in
the
great
west
i
am
usually
the
calm
collected
eugène
valmont
whom
nothing
can
perturb
but
this
was
a
time
of
great
tension
and
i
had
become
absorbed
i
was
alone
with
the
minister
in
his
private
house
and
one
of
the
papers
he
desired
was
in
his
bureau
at
the
ministry
for
foreign
affairs
at
least
he
thought
so
and
said
it
is
in
my
desk
at
the
bureau
how
annoying
i
must
send
for
it
excellency
i
cried
springing
up
in
a
the
most
complete
is
here
touching
the
spring
of
a
secret
drawer
i
opened
it
and
taking
out
the
document
he
wished
handed
it
to
him
it
was
not
until
i
met
his
searching
look
and
saw
the
faint
smile
on
his
lips
that
i
realised
what
i
had
done
he
said
quietly
whose
behalf
did
you
search
my
house
i
replied
in
tones
no
less
agreeable
than
his
own
at
your
orders
i
pay
a
domiciliary
visit
to
the
mansion
of
baron
dumoulaine
who
stands
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
president
of
the
french
republic
if
either
of
those
distinguished
gentlemen
should
learn
of
my
informal
call
and
should
ask
me
in
whose
interests
i
made
the
domiciliary
visit
what
is
it
you
wish
that
i
should
reply
should
reply
valmont
that
you
did
it
in
the
interests
of
the
secret
service
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
excellency
and
in
answer
to
your
question
just
now
i
had
the
honour
of
searching
this
mansion
in
the
interests
of
the
secret
service
of
france
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
that
expressed
no
resentment
merely
wished
to
compliment
you
valmont
on
the
efficiency
of
your
search
and
the
excellence
of
your
memory
this
is
indeed
the
document
which
i
thought
was
left
in
my
office
i
wonder
what
lord
lansdowne
would
say
if
spenser
hale
showed
an
equal
familiarity
with
his
private
papers
but
now
that
we
have
returned
to
our
good
friend
hale
we
must
not
keep
him
waiting
any
longer
i
well
remember
the
november
day
when
i
first
heard
of
the
summertrees
case
because
there
hung
over
london
a
fog
so
thick
that
two
or
three
times
i
lost
my
way
and
no
cab
was
to
be
had
at
any
price
the
few
cabmen
then
in
the
streets
were
leading
their
animals
slowly
along
making
for
their
stables
it
was
one
of
those
depressing
london
days
which
filled
me
with
ennui
and
a
yearning
for
my
own
clear
city
of
paris
where
if
we
are
ever
visited
by
a
slight
mist
it
is
at
least
clean
white
vapour
and
not
this
horrible
london
mixture
saturated
with
suffocating
carbon
the
fog
was
too
thick
for
any
passer
to
read
the
contents
bills
of
the
newspapers
plastered
on
the
pavement
and
as
there
were
probably
no
races
that
day
the
newsboys
were
shouting
what
they
considered
the
next
most
important
event
the
election
of
an
american
president
i
bought
a
paper
and
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
it
was
late
when
i
reached
my
flat
and
after
dining
there
which
was
an
unusual
thing
for
me
to
do
i
put
on
my
slippers
took
an
before
the
fire
and
began
to
read
my
evening
journal
i
was
distressed
to
learn
that
the
eloquent
bryan
had
been
defeated
i
knew
little
about
the
silver
question
but
the
man
oratorical
powers
had
appealed
to
me
and
my
sympathy
was
aroused
because
he
owned
many
silver
mines
and
yet
the
price
of
the
metal
was
so
low
that
apparently
he
could
not
make
a
living
through
the
operation
of
them
but
of
course
the
cry
that
he
was
a
plutocrat
and
a
reputed
millionaire
over
and
over
again
was
bound
to
defeat
him
in
a
democracy
where
the
average
voter
is
exceedingly
poor
and
not
comfortably
as
is
the
case
with
our
peasants
in
france
i
always
took
great
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
huge
republic
to
the
west
having
been
at
some
pains
to
inform
myself
accurately
regarding
its
politics
and
although
as
my
readers
know
i
seldom
quote
anything
complimentary
that
is
said
of
me
nevertheless
an
american
client
of
mine
once
admitted
that
he
never
knew
the
true
inwardness
i
think
that
was
the
phrase
he
used
of
american
politics
until
he
heard
me
discourse
upon
them
but
then
he
added
he
had
been
a
very
busy
man
all
his
life
i
had
allowed
my
paper
to
slip
to
the
floor
for
in
very
truth
the
fog
was
penetrating
even
into
my
flat
and
it
was
becoming
difficult
to
read
notwithstanding
the
electric
light
my
man
came
in
and
announced
that
spenser
hale
wished
to
see
me
and
indeed
any
night
but
especially
when
there
is
rain
or
fog
outside
i
am
more
pleased
to
talk
with
a
friend
than
to
read
a
newspaper
my
dear
monsieur
hale
it
is
a
brave
man
you
are
to
venture
out
in
such
a
fog
as
is
abroad
tonight
monsieur
valmont
said
hale
with
pride
can
not
raise
a
fog
like
this
in
paris
there
you
are
supreme
i
admitted
rising
and
saluting
my
visitor
then
offering
him
a
chair
see
you
are
reading
the
latest
news
he
said
indicating
my
newspaper
am
very
glad
that
man
bryan
is
defeated
now
we
shall
have
better
times
i
waved
my
hand
as
i
took
my
chair
again
i
will
discuss
many
things
with
spenser
hale
but
not
american
politics
he
does
not
understand
them
it
is
a
common
defect
of
the
english
to
suffer
complete
ignorance
regarding
the
internal
affairs
of
other
countries
is
surely
an
important
thing
that
brought
you
out
on
such
a
night
as
this
the
fog
must
be
very
thick
in
scotland
yard
this
delicate
shaft
of
fancy
completely
missed
him
and
he
answered
stolidly
thick
all
over
london
and
indeed
throughout
most
of
england
it
is
i
agreed
but
he
did
not
see
that
either
still
a
moment
later
he
made
a
remark
which
if
it
had
come
from
some
people
i
know
might
have
indicated
a
glimmer
of
comprehension
are
a
very
very
clever
man
monsieur
valmont
so
all
i
need
say
is
that
the
question
which
brought
me
here
is
the
same
as
that
on
which
the
american
election
was
fought
now
to
a
countryman
i
should
be
compelled
to
give
further
explanation
but
to
you
monsieur
that
will
not
be
necessary
there
are
times
when
i
dislike
the
crafty
smile
and
partial
closing
of
the
eyes
which
always
distinguishes
spenser
hale
when
he
places
on
the
table
a
problem
which
he
expects
will
baffle
me
if
i
said
he
never
did
baffle
me
i
would
be
wrong
of
course
for
sometimes
the
utter
simplicity
of
the
puzzles
which
trouble
him
leads
me
into
an
intricate
involution
entirely
unnecessary
in
the
circumstances
i
pressed
my
fingertips
together
and
gazed
for
a
few
moments
at
the
ceiling
hale
had
lit
his
black
pipe
and
my
silent
servant
placed
at
his
elbow
the
whisky
and
soda
then
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
as
the
door
closed
my
eyes
came
from
the
ceiling
to
the
level
of
expansive
countenance
they
eluded
you
i
asked
quietly
coiners
hale
pipe
dropped
from
his
jaw
but
he
managed
to
catch
it
before
it
reached
the
floor
then
he
took
a
gulp
from
the
tumbler
was
just
a
lucky
shot
he
said
i
replied
carelessly
own
up
valmont
was
it
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
a
man
can
not
contradict
a
guest
in
his
own
house
stow
that
cried
hale
impolitely
he
is
a
trifle
prone
to
strong
and
even
slangy
expressions
when
puzzled
me
how
you
guessed
it
is
very
simple
the
question
on
which
the
american
election
was
fought
is
the
price
of
silver
which
is
so
low
that
it
has
ruined
bryan
and
threatens
to
ruin
all
the
farmers
of
the
west
who
possess
silver
mines
on
their
farms
silver
troubled
america
ergo
silver
troubles
scotland
yard
well
the
natural
inference
is
that
someone
has
stolen
bars
of
silver
but
such
a
theft
happened
three
months
ago
when
the
metal
was
being
unloaded
from
a
german
steamer
at
southampton
and
my
dear
friend
spenser
hale
ran
down
the
thieves
very
cleverly
as
they
were
trying
to
dissolve
the
marks
off
the
bars
with
acid
now
crimes
do
not
run
in
series
like
the
numbers
in
roulette
at
monte
carlo
the
thieves
are
men
of
brains
they
say
to
themselves
what
chance
is
there
successfully
to
steal
bars
of
silver
while
hale
is
at
scotland
yard
eh
my
good
friend
valmont
said
hale
taking
another
sip
you
almost
persuade
me
that
you
have
reasoning
powers
comrade
then
it
is
not
a
of
silver
we
have
now
to
deal
with
but
the
american
election
was
fought
on
the
of
silver
if
silver
had
been
high
in
cost
there
would
have
been
no
silver
question
so
the
crime
that
is
bothering
you
arises
through
the
low
price
of
silver
and
this
suggests
that
it
must
be
a
case
of
illicit
coinage
for
there
the
low
price
of
the
metal
comes
in
you
have
perhaps
found
a
more
subtle
illegitimate
act
going
forward
than
heretofore
someone
is
making
your
shillings
and
your
from
real
silver
instead
of
from
baser
metal
and
yet
there
is
a
large
profit
which
has
not
hitherto
been
possible
through
the
high
price
of
silver
with
the
old
conditions
you
were
familiar
but
this
new
element
sets
at
nought
all
your
previous
formulae
that
is
how
i
reasoned
the
matter
out
valmont
you
have
hit
it
i
say
that
for
you
you
have
hit
it
there
is
a
gang
of
expert
coiners
who
are
putting
out
real
silver
money
and
making
a
clear
shilling
on
the
we
can
find
no
trace
of
the
coiners
but
we
know
the
man
who
is
shoving
the
stuff
ought
to
be
sufficient
i
suggested
it
should
but
it
has
proved
so
up
to
date
now
i
came
tonight
to
see
if
you
would
do
one
of
your
french
tricks
for
us
right
on
the
quiet
french
trick
monsieur
spenser
hale
i
inquired
with
some
asperity
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
the
man
invariably
became
impolite
when
he
grew
excited
offence
intended
said
this
blundering
officer
who
really
is
a
fellow
but
always
puts
his
foot
in
it
and
then
apologises
want
someone
to
go
through
a
man
house
without
a
search
warrant
spot
the
evidence
let
me
know
and
then
we
rush
the
place
before
he
has
time
to
hide
his
tracks
is
this
man
and
where
does
he
live
name
is
ralph
summertrees
and
he
lives
in
a
very
natty
little
bijou
residence
as
the
advertisements
call
it
situated
in
no
less
a
fashionable
street
than
park
lane
see
what
has
aroused
your
suspicions
against
him
you
know
that
an
expensive
district
to
live
in
it
takes
a
bit
of
money
to
do
the
trick
this
summertrees
has
no
ostensible
business
yet
every
friday
he
goes
to
the
united
capital
bank
in
piccadilly
and
deposits
a
bag
of
swag
usually
all
silver
coin
and
this
money
money
so
far
as
we
can
learn
contains
a
good
many
of
these
new
pieces
which
never
saw
the
british
mint
not
all
the
new
coinage
then
no
he
a
bit
too
artful
for
that
you
see
a
man
can
go
round
london
his
pockets
filled
with
new
coinage
pieces
buy
this
that
and
the
other
and
come
home
with
his
change
in
legitimate
coins
of
the
realm
florins
shillings
sixpences
and
all
that
see
then
why
do
you
nab
him
one
day
when
his
pockets
are
stuffed
with
illegitimate
pieces
could
be
done
of
course
and
i
thought
of
it
but
you
see
we
want
to
land
the
whole
gang
once
we
arrested
him
without
knowing
where
the
money
came
from
the
real
coiners
would
take
flight
do
you
know
he
is
not
the
real
coiner
himself
now
poor
hale
is
as
easy
to
read
as
a
book
he
hesitated
before
answering
this
question
and
looked
confused
as
a
culprit
caught
in
some
dishonest
act
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
i
said
soothingly
after
a
pause
have
had
one
of
your
men
in
summertrees
house
and
so
learned
that
he
is
not
the
coiner
but
your
man
has
not
succeeded
in
getting
you
evidence
to
incriminate
other
people
about
hit
it
again
monsieur
valmont
one
of
my
men
has
been
summertrees
butler
for
two
weeks
but
as
you
say
he
has
found
no
evidence
he
still
butler
tell
me
how
far
you
have
got
you
know
that
summertrees
deposits
a
bag
of
coin
every
friday
in
the
piccadilly
bank
and
i
suppose
the
bank
has
allowed
you
to
examine
one
or
two
of
the
bags
sir
they
have
but
you
see
banks
are
very
difficult
to
treat
with
they
do
like
detectives
bothering
round
and
whilst
they
do
not
stand
out
against
the
law
still
they
never
answer
any
more
questions
than
they
asked
and
summertrees
has
been
a
good
customer
at
the
united
capital
for
many
years
you
found
out
where
the
money
comes
from
we
have
it
is
brought
there
night
after
night
by
a
man
who
looks
like
a
respectable
city
clerk
and
he
puts
it
into
a
large
safe
of
which
he
holds
the
key
this
safe
being
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
you
followed
the
clerk
he
sleeps
in
the
park
lane
house
every
night
and
goes
up
in
the
morning
to
an
old
curiosity
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
where
he
stays
all
day
returning
with
his
bag
of
money
in
the
evening
do
you
arrest
and
question
him
monsieur
valmont
there
is
just
the
same
objection
to
his
arrest
as
to
that
of
summertrees
himself
we
could
easily
arrest
both
but
we
have
not
the
slightest
evidence
against
either
of
them
and
then
although
we
put
the
in
clink
the
worst
criminals
of
the
lot
would
escape
suspicious
about
the
old
curiosity
shop
it
appears
to
be
perfectly
regular
game
has
been
going
on
under
your
noses
for
how
long
about
six
weeks
summertrees
a
married
man
there
any
women
servants
in
the
house
except
that
three
charwomen
come
in
every
morning
to
do
up
the
rooms
what
is
his
household
comprised
is
the
butler
then
the
valet
and
last
the
french
cook
cried
i
french
cook
this
case
interests
me
so
summertrees
has
succeeded
in
completely
disconcerting
your
man
has
he
prevented
him
going
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
house
no
he
has
rather
assisted
him
than
otherwise
on
one
occasion
he
went
to
the
safe
took
out
the
money
had
podgers
that
my
name
help
him
to
count
it
and
then
actually
sent
podgers
to
the
bank
with
the
bag
of
coin
podgers
has
been
all
over
the
place
no
signs
of
a
coining
establishment
it
is
absolutely
impossible
that
any
coining
can
be
done
there
besides
as
i
tell
you
that
respectable
clerk
brings
him
the
money
suppose
you
want
me
to
take
podgers
position
monsieur
valmont
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
would
rather
you
did
podgers
has
done
everything
a
man
can
do
but
i
thought
if
you
got
into
the
house
podgers
assisting
you
might
go
through
it
night
after
night
at
your
leisure
see
that
just
a
little
dangerous
in
england
i
think
i
should
prefer
to
assure
myself
the
legitimate
standing
of
being
the
amiable
podgers
successor
you
say
that
summertrees
has
no
business
sir
not
what
you
might
call
a
business
he
is
by
the
way
of
being
an
author
but
i
do
count
that
any
business
an
author
is
he
when
does
he
do
his
writing
locks
himself
up
most
of
the
day
in
his
study
he
come
out
for
lunch
he
lights
a
little
spirit
lamp
inside
podgers
tells
me
and
makes
himself
a
cup
of
coffee
which
he
takes
with
a
sandwich
or
two
rather
frugal
fare
for
park
lane
monsieur
valmont
it
is
but
he
makes
it
up
in
the
evening
when
he
has
a
long
dinner
with
all
them
foreign
kickshaws
you
people
like
done
by
his
french
cook
man
well
hale
i
see
i
shall
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
making
the
acquaintance
of
summertrees
is
there
any
restriction
on
the
going
and
coming
of
your
man
podgers
in
the
least
he
can
get
away
either
night
or
day
good
friend
hale
bring
him
here
tomorrow
as
soon
as
our
author
locks
himself
up
in
his
study
or
rather
i
should
say
as
soon
as
the
respectable
clerk
leaves
for
tottenham
court
road
which
i
should
guess
as
you
put
it
is
about
half
an
hour
after
his
master
turns
the
key
of
the
room
in
which
he
writes
are
quite
right
in
that
guess
valmont
how
did
you
hit
it
a
surmise
hale
there
is
a
good
deal
of
oddity
about
that
park
lane
house
so
it
does
surprise
me
in
the
least
that
the
master
gets
to
work
earlier
in
the
morning
than
the
man
i
have
also
a
suspicion
that
ralph
summertrees
knows
perfectly
well
what
the
estimable
podgers
is
there
for
makes
you
think
that
can
give
no
reason
except
that
my
opinion
of
the
acuteness
of
summertrees
has
been
gradually
rising
all
the
while
you
were
speaking
and
at
the
same
time
my
estimate
of
podgers
craft
has
been
as
steadily
declining
however
bring
the
man
here
tomorrow
that
i
may
ask
him
a
few
questions
next
day
about
eleven
the
ponderous
podgers
hat
in
hand
followed
his
chief
into
my
room
his
broad
impassive
immobile
smooth
face
gave
him
rather
more
the
air
of
a
genuine
butler
than
i
had
expected
and
this
appearance
of
course
was
enhanced
by
his
livery
his
replies
to
my
questions
were
those
of
a
servant
who
will
not
say
too
much
unless
it
is
made
worth
his
while
all
in
all
podgers
exceeded
my
expectations
and
really
my
friend
hale
had
some
justification
for
regarding
him
as
he
evidently
did
a
triumph
in
his
line
down
hale
and
you
podgers
the
man
disregarded
my
invitation
standing
like
a
statue
until
his
chief
made
a
motion
then
he
dropped
into
a
chair
the
english
are
great
on
discipline
hale
i
must
first
congratulate
you
on
the
of
podgers
it
is
excellent
you
depend
less
on
artificial
assistance
than
we
do
in
france
and
in
that
i
think
you
are
right
we
know
a
bit
over
here
monsieur
valmont
said
hale
with
pardonable
pride
then
podgers
i
want
to
ask
you
about
this
clerk
what
time
does
he
arrive
in
the
evening
prompt
six
sir
he
ring
or
let
himself
in
with
a
latchkey
a
latchkey
sir
does
he
carry
the
money
a
little
locked
leather
satchel
sir
flung
over
his
shoulder
he
go
direct
to
the
sir
you
seen
him
unlock
the
safe
and
put
in
the
money
sir
the
safe
unlock
with
a
word
or
a
key
a
key
sir
it
one
of
the
kind
the
clerk
unlocks
his
leather
money
bag
sir
three
keys
used
within
as
many
minutes
are
they
separate
or
in
a
bunch
a
bunch
sir
you
ever
see
your
master
with
this
bunch
of
keys
sir
saw
him
open
the
safe
once
i
am
told
sir
he
use
a
separate
key
or
one
of
a
bunch
podgers
slowly
scratched
his
head
then
said
do
just
remember
sir
podgers
you
are
neglecting
the
big
things
in
that
house
sure
you
ca
remember
sir
the
money
is
in
and
the
safe
locked
up
what
does
the
clerk
do
to
his
room
sir
is
this
room
the
third
floor
sir
do
you
sleep
the
fourth
floor
with
the
rest
of
the
servants
sir
does
the
master
sleep
the
second
floor
adjoining
his
study
house
consists
of
four
stories
and
a
basement
does
it
sir
have
somehow
arrived
at
the
suspicion
that
it
is
a
very
narrow
house
is
that
true
sir
the
clerk
ever
dine
with
your
master
sir
the
clerk
do
eat
in
the
house
at
all
sir
he
go
away
before
breakfast
sir
one
takes
breakfast
to
his
room
sir
time
does
he
leave
the
house
ten
sir
is
breakfast
served
nine
sir
what
hour
does
your
master
retire
to
his
study
nine
sir
the
door
on
the
inside
sir
rings
for
anything
during
the
day
that
i
know
of
sir
sort
of
a
man
is
he
here
podgers
was
on
familiar
ground
and
he
rattled
off
a
description
minute
in
every
particular
i
meant
was
podgers
is
he
silent
or
talkative
or
does
he
get
angry
does
he
seem
furtive
suspicious
anxious
terrorised
calm
excitable
or
what
sir
he
is
by
way
of
being
very
quiet
never
has
much
to
say
for
himself
never
saw
him
angry
or
excited
podgers
you
been
at
park
lane
for
a
fortnight
or
more
you
are
a
sharp
alert
observant
man
what
happens
there
that
strikes
you
as
unusual
i
ca
exactly
say
sir
replied
podgers
looking
rather
helplessly
from
his
chief
to
myself
and
back
again
professional
duties
have
often
compelled
you
to
enact
the
part
of
butler
before
otherwise
you
would
do
it
so
well
is
that
the
case
podgers
did
not
reply
but
glanced
at
his
chief
this
was
evidently
a
question
pertaining
to
the
service
which
a
subordinate
was
not
allowed
to
answer
however
hale
said
at
once
podgers
has
been
in
dozens
of
places
podgers
just
call
to
mind
some
of
the
other
households
where
you
have
been
employed
and
tell
me
any
particulars
in
which
mr
summertrees
establishment
differs
from
them
podgers
pondered
a
long
time
sir
he
do
stick
to
writing
pretty
close
that
his
profession
you
see
podgers
hard
at
it
from
nine
till
towards
seven
i
imagine
sir
else
podgers
no
matter
how
trivial
sir
he
fond
of
reading
too
leastways
he
fond
of
newspapers
does
he
read
never
seen
him
read
sir
indeed
so
far
as
i
can
tell
i
never
knew
the
papers
to
be
opened
but
he
takes
them
all
in
sir
all
the
morning
papers
sir
and
all
the
evening
papers
too
are
the
morning
papers
placed
the
table
in
his
study
sir
the
evening
papers
sir
when
the
evening
papers
come
the
study
is
locked
they
are
put
on
a
side
table
in
the
and
he
takes
them
upstairs
with
him
to
his
study
has
happened
every
day
since
you
been
there
sir
reported
that
very
striking
fact
to
your
chief
of
course
sir
i
do
think
i
did
said
podgers
confused
should
have
done
so
hale
would
have
known
how
to
make
the
most
of
a
point
so
vital
come
now
valmont
interrupted
hale
chaffing
us
plenty
of
people
take
in
all
the
papers
think
not
even
clubs
and
hotels
subscribe
to
the
leading
journals
only
you
said
i
think
podgers
all
sir
which
is
it
there
a
vast
difference
takes
a
good
many
sir
many
do
just
know
sir
easily
found
out
valmont
cried
hale
with
some
impatience
you
think
it
really
important
think
it
so
important
that
i
going
back
with
podgers
myself
you
can
take
me
into
the
house
i
suppose
when
you
return
yes
sir
back
to
these
newspapers
for
a
moment
podgers
what
is
done
with
them
are
sold
to
the
ragman
sir
once
a
week
takes
them
from
the
study
do
sir
they
appear
to
have
been
read
very
carefully
no
sir
leastways
some
of
them
seem
never
to
have
been
opened
or
else
folded
up
very
carefully
again
you
notice
that
extracts
have
been
clipped
from
any
of
them
sir
summertrees
keep
a
scrapbook
that
i
know
of
sir
the
case
is
perfectly
plain
said
i
leaning
back
in
my
chair
and
regarding
the
puzzled
hale
with
that
cherubic
expression
of
which
i
know
is
so
annoying
to
him
perfectly
plain
he
demanded
more
gruffly
perhaps
than
etiquette
would
have
sanctioned
is
no
coiner
nor
is
he
linked
with
any
band
of
coiners
is
he
then
that
opens
another
avenue
of
enquiry
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
he
may
be
the
most
honest
of
men
on
the
surface
it
would
appear
that
he
is
a
reasonably
industrious
tradesman
in
tottenham
court
road
who
is
anxious
that
there
should
be
no
visible
connection
between
a
plebian
employment
and
so
aristocratic
a
residence
as
that
in
park
lane
at
this
point
spenser
hale
gave
expression
to
one
of
those
rare
flashes
of
reason
which
are
always
an
astonishment
to
his
friends
is
nonsense
monsieur
valmont
he
said
man
who
is
ashamed
of
the
connection
between
his
business
and
his
house
is
one
who
is
trying
to
get
into
society
or
else
the
women
of
his
family
are
trying
it
as
is
usually
the
case
now
summertrees
has
no
family
he
himself
goes
nowhere
gives
no
entertainments
and
accepts
no
invitations
he
belongs
to
no
club
therefore
to
say
that
he
is
ashamed
of
his
connection
with
the
tottenham
court
road
shop
is
absurd
he
is
concealing
the
connection
for
some
other
reason
that
will
bear
looking
into
dear
hale
the
goddess
of
wisdom
herself
could
not
have
made
a
more
sensible
series
of
remarks
now
do
you
want
my
assistance
or
have
you
enough
to
go
on
with
to
go
on
with
we
have
nothing
more
than
we
had
when
i
called
on
you
last
night
night
my
dear
hale
you
supposed
this
man
was
in
league
with
coiners
today
you
know
he
is
not
know
you
he
is
not
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
raised
my
eyebrows
smiling
at
him
is
the
same
thing
monsieur
hale
of
all
the
conceited
and
the
good
hale
could
get
no
further
you
wish
my
assistance
it
is
yours
good
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
i
do
that
case
my
dear
podgers
you
will
return
to
the
residence
of
our
friend
summertrees
and
get
together
for
me
in
a
bundle
all
of
yesterday
morning
and
evening
papers
that
were
delivered
to
the
house
can
you
do
that
or
are
they
mixed
up
in
a
heap
in
the
coal
cellar
can
do
it
sir
i
have
instructions
to
place
each
day
papers
in
a
pile
by
itself
in
case
they
should
be
wanted
again
there
is
always
one
week
supply
in
the
cellar
and
we
sell
the
papers
of
the
week
before
to
the
rag
men
well
take
the
risk
of
abstracting
one
day
journals
and
have
them
ready
for
me
i
will
call
upon
you
at
three
exactly
and
then
i
want
you
to
take
me
upstairs
to
the
clerk
bedroom
in
the
third
story
which
i
suppose
is
not
locked
during
the
daytime
sir
it
is
not
with
this
the
patient
podgers
took
his
departure
spenser
hale
rose
when
his
assistant
left
further
i
can
do
he
asked
give
me
the
address
of
the
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
do
you
happen
to
have
about
you
one
of
those
new
pieces
which
you
believe
to
be
illegally
coined
he
opened
his
took
out
the
bit
of
white
metal
and
handed
it
to
me
going
to
pass
this
off
before
evening
i
said
putting
it
in
my
pocket
i
hope
none
of
your
men
will
arrest
me
all
right
laughed
hale
as
he
took
his
leave
at
three
podgers
was
waiting
for
me
and
opened
the
front
door
as
i
came
up
the
steps
thus
saving
me
the
necessity
of
ringing
the
house
seemed
strangely
quiet
the
french
cook
was
evidently
down
in
the
basement
and
we
had
probably
all
the
upper
part
to
ourselves
unless
summertrees
was
in
his
study
which
i
doubted
podgers
led
me
directly
upstairs
to
the
clerk
room
on
the
third
floor
walking
on
tiptoe
with
an
elephantine
air
of
silence
and
secrecy
combined
which
struck
me
as
unnecessary
will
make
an
examination
of
this
room
i
said
wait
for
me
down
by
the
door
of
the
study
the
bedroom
proved
to
be
of
respectable
size
when
one
considers
the
smallness
of
the
house
the
bed
was
all
nicely
made
up
and
there
were
two
chairs
in
the
room
but
the
usual
washstand
and
were
not
visible
however
seeing
a
curtain
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
i
drew
it
aside
and
found
as
i
expected
a
fixed
lavatory
in
an
alcove
of
perhaps
four
feet
deep
by
five
in
width
as
the
room
was
about
fifteen
feet
wide
this
left
of
the
space
unaccounted
for
a
moment
later
i
opened
a
door
which
exhibited
a
closet
filled
with
clothes
hanging
on
hooks
this
left
a
space
of
five
feet
between
the
clothes
closet
and
the
lavatory
i
thought
at
first
that
the
entrance
to
the
secret
stairway
must
have
issued
from
the
lavatory
but
examining
the
boards
closely
although
they
sounded
hollow
to
the
knuckles
they
were
quite
evidently
plain
matchboarding
and
not
a
concealed
door
the
entrance
to
the
stairway
therefore
must
issue
from
the
clothes
closet
the
right
hand
wall
proved
similar
to
the
matchboarding
of
the
lavatory
as
far
as
the
casual
eye
or
touch
was
concerned
but
i
saw
at
once
it
was
a
door
the
latch
turned
out
to
be
somewhat
ingeniously
operated
by
one
of
the
hooks
which
held
a
pair
of
old
trousers
i
found
that
the
hook
if
pressed
upward
allowed
the
door
to
swing
outward
over
the
stairhead
descending
to
the
second
floor
a
similar
latch
let
me
in
to
a
similar
clothes
closet
in
the
room
beneath
the
two
rooms
were
identical
in
size
one
directly
above
the
other
the
only
difference
being
that
the
lower
room
door
gave
into
the
study
instead
of
into
the
hall
as
was
the
case
with
the
upper
chamber
the
study
was
extremely
neat
either
not
much
used
or
the
abode
of
a
very
methodical
man
there
was
nothing
on
the
table
except
a
pile
of
that
morning
papers
i
walked
to
the
farther
end
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
came
out
upon
the
astonished
podgers
i
blowed
exclaimed
he
so
i
rejoined
been
tiptoeing
past
an
empty
room
for
the
last
two
weeks
now
if
you
come
with
me
podgers
i
show
you
how
the
trick
is
done
when
he
entered
the
study
i
locked
the
door
once
more
and
led
the
assumed
butler
still
tiptoeing
through
force
of
habit
up
the
stair
into
the
top
bedroom
and
so
out
again
leaving
everything
exactly
as
we
found
it
we
went
down
the
main
stair
to
the
front
hall
and
there
podgers
had
my
parcel
of
papers
all
neatly
wrapped
up
this
bundle
i
carried
to
my
flat
gave
one
of
my
assistants
some
instructions
and
left
him
at
work
on
the
papers
i
took
a
cab
to
the
foot
of
tottenham
court
road
and
walked
up
that
street
till
i
came
to
simpson
old
curiosity
shop
after
gazing
at
the
windows
for
some
time
i
stepped
aside
having
selected
a
little
iron
crucifix
displayed
behind
the
pane
the
work
of
some
ancient
craftsman
i
knew
at
once
from
podgers
description
that
i
was
waited
upon
by
the
veritable
respectable
clerk
who
brought
the
bag
of
money
each
night
to
park
lane
and
who
i
was
certain
was
no
other
than
ralph
summertrees
himself
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
differing
from
that
of
any
other
quiet
salesman
the
price
of
the
crucifix
proved
to
be
and
i
threw
down
a
sovereign
to
pay
for
it
you
mind
the
change
being
all
in
silver
sir
he
asked
and
i
answered
without
any
eagerness
although
the
question
aroused
a
suspicion
that
had
begun
to
be
allayed
in
the
least
he
gave
me
three
pieces
and
four
separate
shillings
all
the
coins
being
silver
of
the
realm
the
undoubted
inartistic
product
of
the
reputable
british
mint
this
seemed
to
dispose
of
the
theory
that
he
was
palming
off
illegitimate
money
he
asked
me
if
i
were
interested
in
any
particular
branch
of
antiquity
and
i
replied
that
my
curiosity
was
merely
general
and
exceedingly
amateurish
whereupon
he
invited
me
to
look
around
this
i
proceeded
to
do
while
he
resumed
the
addressing
and
stamping
of
some
pamphlets
which
i
surmised
to
be
copies
of
his
catalogue
he
made
no
attempt
either
to
watch
me
or
to
press
his
wares
upon
me
i
selected
at
random
a
little
and
asked
its
price
it
was
two
shillings
he
said
whereupon
i
produced
my
fraudulent
piece
he
took
it
gave
me
the
change
without
comment
and
the
last
doubt
about
his
connection
with
coiners
flickered
from
my
mind
at
this
moment
a
young
man
came
in
who
i
saw
at
once
was
not
a
customer
he
walked
briskly
to
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
and
disappeared
behind
a
partition
which
had
one
pane
of
glass
in
it
that
gave
an
outlook
towards
the
front
door
me
a
moment
said
the
shopkeeper
and
he
followed
the
young
man
into
the
private
office
as
i
examined
the
curious
heterogeneous
collection
of
things
for
sale
i
heard
the
clink
of
coins
being
poured
out
on
the
lid
of
a
desk
or
an
uncovered
table
and
the
murmur
of
voices
floated
out
to
me
i
was
now
near
the
entrance
of
the
shop
and
by
a
trick
keeping
the
corner
of
my
eye
on
the
glass
pane
of
the
private
office
i
removed
the
key
of
the
front
door
without
a
sound
and
took
an
impression
of
it
in
wax
returning
the
key
to
its
place
unobserved
at
this
moment
another
young
man
came
in
and
walked
straight
past
me
into
the
private
office
i
heard
him
say
i
beg
pardon
simpson
how
are
you
rogers
macpherson
saluted
rogers
who
then
came
out
bidding
to
simpson
and
departed
whistling
down
the
street
but
not
before
he
had
repeated
his
phrase
to
another
young
man
entering
to
whom
he
gave
the
name
of
tyrrel
i
noted
these
three
names
in
my
mind
two
others
came
in
together
but
i
was
compelled
to
content
myself
with
memorising
their
features
for
i
did
not
learn
their
names
these
men
were
evidently
collectors
for
i
heard
the
rattle
of
money
in
every
case
yet
here
was
a
small
shop
doing
apparently
very
little
business
for
i
had
been
within
it
for
more
than
half
an
hour
and
yet
remained
the
only
customer
if
credit
were
given
one
collector
would
certainly
have
been
sufficient
yet
five
had
come
in
and
had
poured
their
contributions
into
the
pile
summertrees
was
to
take
home
with
him
that
night
i
determined
to
secure
one
of
the
pamphlets
which
the
man
had
been
addressing
they
were
piled
on
a
shelf
behind
the
counter
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
reaching
across
and
taking
the
one
on
top
which
i
slipped
into
my
pocket
when
the
fifth
young
man
went
down
the
street
summertrees
himself
emerged
and
this
time
he
carried
in
his
hand
the
locked
leather
satchel
with
the
straps
dangling
it
was
now
approaching
five
and
i
saw
he
was
eager
to
close
up
and
get
away
else
you
fancy
sir
he
asked
me
or
rather
yes
and
no
you
have
a
very
interesting
collection
here
but
it
getting
so
dark
i
can
hardly
see
close
at
five
sir
in
that
case
i
said
consulting
my
watch
shall
be
pleased
to
call
some
other
time
you
sir
replied
summertrees
quietly
and
with
that
i
took
my
leave
from
the
corner
of
an
alley
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
i
saw
him
put
up
the
shutters
with
his
own
hands
then
he
emerged
with
overcoat
on
and
the
money
satchel
slung
across
his
shoulder
he
locked
the
door
tested
it
with
his
knuckles
and
walked
down
the
street
carrying
under
one
arm
the
pamphlets
he
had
been
addressing
i
followed
him
some
distance
saw
him
drop
the
pamphlets
into
the
box
at
the
first
post
office
he
passed
and
walk
rapidly
towards
his
house
in
park
lane
when
i
returned
to
my
flat
and
called
in
my
assistant
he
said
putting
to
one
side
the
regular
advertisements
of
pills
soap
and
what
not
here
is
the
only
one
common
to
all
the
newspapers
morning
and
evening
alike
the
advertisements
are
not
identical
sir
but
they
have
two
points
of
similarity
or
perhaps
i
should
say
three
they
all
profess
to
furnish
a
cure
for
they
all
ask
that
the
applicant
chief
hobby
shall
be
stated
and
they
all
bear
the
same
address
willoughby
in
tottenham
court
road
you
said
i
as
he
placed
the
scissored
advertisements
before
me
i
read
several
of
the
announcements
they
were
all
small
and
perhaps
that
is
why
i
had
never
noticed
one
of
them
in
the
newspapers
for
certainly
they
were
odd
enough
some
asked
for
lists
of
men
with
the
hobbies
of
each
and
for
these
lists
prizes
of
from
one
shilling
to
six
were
offered
in
other
clippings
willoughby
professed
to
be
able
to
cure
there
were
no
fees
and
no
treatment
but
a
pamphlet
would
be
sent
which
if
it
did
not
benefit
the
receiver
could
do
no
harm
the
doctor
was
unable
to
meet
patients
personally
nor
could
he
enter
into
correspondence
with
them
the
address
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
old
curiosity
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
at
this
juncture
i
pulled
the
pamphlet
from
my
pocket
and
saw
it
was
entitled
science
and
by
stamford
willoughby
and
at
the
end
of
the
article
was
the
statement
contained
in
the
advertisements
that
dr
willoughby
would
neither
see
patients
nor
hold
any
correspondence
with
them
i
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
me
wrote
to
willoughby
alleging
that
i
was
a
very
man
and
would
be
glad
of
his
pamphlet
adding
that
my
special
hobby
was
the
collecting
of
first
editions
i
then
signed
myself
webster
imperial
flats
london
i
may
here
explain
that
it
is
often
necessary
for
me
to
see
people
under
some
other
name
than
the
appellation
of
eugène
valmont
there
are
two
doors
to
my
flat
and
on
one
of
these
is
painted
valmont
on
the
other
there
is
a
receptacle
into
which
can
be
slipped
a
sliding
panel
bearing
any
de
i
choose
the
same
device
is
arranged
on
the
ground
floor
where
the
names
of
all
the
occupants
of
the
building
appear
on
the
wall
i
sealed
addressed
and
stamped
my
letter
then
told
my
man
to
put
out
the
name
of
alport
webster
and
if
i
did
not
happen
to
be
in
when
anyone
called
upon
that
mythical
person
he
was
to
make
an
appointment
for
me
it
was
nearly
six
next
afternoon
when
the
card
of
angus
macpherson
was
brought
in
to
alport
webster
i
recognised
the
young
man
at
once
as
the
second
who
had
entered
the
little
shop
carrying
his
tribute
to
simpson
the
day
before
he
held
three
volumes
under
his
arm
and
spoke
in
such
a
pleasant
insinuating
sort
of
way
that
i
knew
at
once
he
was
an
adept
in
his
profession
of
canvasser
you
be
seated
macpherson
in
what
can
i
serve
you
he
placed
the
three
volumes
backs
upward
on
my
table
you
interested
at
all
in
first
editions
mr
webster
is
the
one
thing
i
am
interested
in
i
replied
unfortunately
they
often
run
into
a
lot
of
money
is
true
said
macpherson
sympathetically
i
have
here
three
books
one
of
which
is
an
exemplification
of
what
you
say
this
one
costs
a
hundred
pounds
the
last
copy
that
was
sold
by
auction
in
london
brought
a
hundred
and
pounds
this
next
one
is
forty
pounds
and
the
third
ten
pounds
at
these
prices
i
am
certain
you
could
not
duplicate
three
such
treasures
in
any
book
shop
in
britain
i
examined
them
critically
and
saw
at
once
that
what
he
said
was
true
he
was
still
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
take
a
chair
macpherson
do
you
mean
to
say
you
go
round
london
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
worth
of
goods
under
your
arm
in
this
careless
way
the
young
man
laughed
run
very
little
risk
webster
i
do
suppose
anyone
i
meet
imagines
for
a
moment
there
is
more
under
my
arm
than
perhaps
a
trio
of
volumes
i
have
picked
up
in
the
fourpenny
box
to
take
home
with
me
i
lingered
over
the
volume
for
which
he
asked
a
hundred
pounds
then
said
looking
across
at
him
came
you
to
be
possessed
of
this
book
for
instance
he
turned
upon
me
a
fine
open
countenance
and
answered
without
hesitation
in
the
frankest
possible
manner
am
not
in
actual
possession
of
it
webster
i
am
by
way
of
being
a
connoisseur
in
rare
and
valuable
books
myself
although
of
course
i
have
little
money
with
which
to
indulge
in
the
collection
of
them
i
am
acquainted
however
with
the
lovers
of
desirable
books
in
different
quarters
of
london
these
three
volumes
for
instance
are
from
the
library
of
a
private
gentleman
in
the
west
end
i
have
sold
many
books
to
him
and
he
knows
i
am
trustworthy
he
wishes
to
dispose
of
them
at
something
under
their
real
value
and
has
kindly
allowed
me
to
conduct
the
negotiation
i
make
it
my
business
to
find
out
those
who
are
interested
in
rare
books
and
by
such
trading
i
add
considerably
to
my
income
for
instance
did
you
learn
that
i
was
a
bibliophile
macpherson
laughed
genially
webster
i
must
confess
that
i
chanced
it
i
do
that
very
often
i
take
a
flat
like
this
and
send
in
my
card
to
the
name
on
the
door
if
i
am
invited
in
i
ask
the
occupant
the
question
i
asked
you
just
now
are
you
interested
in
rare
editions
if
he
says
no
i
simply
beg
pardon
and
retire
if
he
says
yes
then
i
show
my
wares
see
said
i
nodding
what
a
glib
young
liar
he
was
with
that
innocent
face
of
his
and
yet
my
next
question
brought
forth
the
truth
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
called
upon
me
macpherson
you
have
no
objection
to
my
making
some
further
inquiry
i
suppose
would
you
mind
telling
me
the
name
of
the
owner
of
these
books
in
the
west
end
name
is
ralph
summertrees
of
park
lane
park
lane
ah
indeed
shall
be
glad
to
leave
the
books
with
you
webster
and
if
you
care
to
make
an
appointment
with
summertrees
i
am
sure
he
will
not
object
to
say
a
word
in
my
favour
i
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
it
and
should
not
think
of
troubling
the
gentleman
was
going
to
tell
you
went
on
the
young
man
i
have
a
friend
a
capitalist
who
in
a
way
is
my
supporter
for
as
i
said
i
have
little
money
of
my
own
i
find
it
is
often
inconvenient
for
people
to
pay
down
any
considerable
sum
when
however
i
strike
a
bargain
my
capitalist
buys
the
book
and
i
make
an
arrangement
with
my
customer
to
pay
a
certain
amount
each
week
and
so
even
a
large
purchase
is
not
felt
as
i
make
the
instalments
small
enough
to
suit
my
client
are
employed
during
the
day
i
take
it
i
am
a
clerk
in
the
city
again
we
were
in
the
blissful
realms
of
fiction
i
take
this
book
at
ten
pounds
what
instalment
should
i
have
to
pay
each
week
what
you
like
sir
would
five
shillings
be
too
much
think
not
well
sir
if
you
pay
me
five
shillings
now
i
will
leave
the
book
with
you
and
shall
have
pleasure
in
calling
this
day
week
for
the
next
instalment
i
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
and
drew
out
two
which
i
passed
over
to
him
i
need
to
sign
any
form
or
undertaking
to
pay
the
rest
the
young
man
laughed
cordially
no
sir
there
is
no
formality
necessary
you
see
sir
this
is
largely
a
labour
of
love
with
me
although
i
do
deny
i
have
my
eye
on
the
future
i
am
getting
together
what
i
hope
will
be
a
very
valuable
connection
with
gentlemen
like
yourself
who
are
fond
of
books
and
i
trust
some
day
that
i
may
be
able
to
resign
my
place
with
the
insurance
company
and
set
up
a
choice
little
business
of
my
own
where
my
knowledge
of
values
in
literature
will
prove
useful
and
then
after
making
a
note
in
a
little
book
he
took
from
his
pocket
he
bade
me
a
most
graceful
and
departed
leaving
me
cogitating
over
what
it
all
meant
next
morning
two
articles
were
handed
to
me
the
first
came
by
post
and
was
a
pamphlet
on
science
and
exactly
similar
to
the
one
i
had
taken
away
from
the
old
curiosity
shop
the
second
was
a
small
key
made
from
my
wax
impression
that
would
fit
the
front
door
of
the
same
shop
a
key
fashioned
by
an
excellent
anarchist
friend
of
mine
in
an
obscure
street
near
holborn
that
night
at
ten
i
was
inside
the
old
curiosity
shop
with
a
small
storage
battery
in
my
pocket
and
a
little
electric
at
my
buttonhole
a
most
useful
instrument
for
either
burglar
or
detective
i
had
expected
to
find
the
books
of
the
establishment
in
a
safe
which
if
it
was
similar
to
the
one
in
park
lane
i
was
prepared
to
open
with
the
false
keys
in
my
possession
or
to
take
an
impression
of
the
keyhole
and
trust
to
my
anarchist
friend
for
the
rest
but
to
my
amazement
i
discovered
all
the
papers
pertaining
to
the
concern
in
a
desk
which
was
not
even
locked
the
books
three
in
number
were
the
ordinary
day
book
journal
and
ledger
referring
to
the
shop
of
the
older
fashion
but
in
a
portfolio
lay
half
a
dozen
foolscap
sheets
headed
rogers
list
macpherson
tyrrel
the
names
i
had
already
learned
and
three
others
these
lists
contained
in
the
first
column
names
in
the
second
column
addresses
in
the
third
sums
of
money
and
then
in
the
small
square
places
following
were
amounts
ranging
from
to
a
pound
at
the
bottom
of
macpherson
list
was
the
name
alport
webster
imperial
flats
then
in
the
small
square
place
five
shillings
these
six
sheets
each
headed
by
a
canvasser
name
were
evidently
the
record
of
current
collections
and
the
innocence
of
the
whole
thing
was
so
apparent
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
fixed
rule
never
to
believe
that
i
am
at
the
bottom
of
any
case
until
i
have
come
on
something
suspicious
i
would
have
gone
out
as
i
came
in
the
six
sheets
were
loose
in
a
thin
portfolio
but
standing
on
a
shelf
above
the
desk
were
a
number
of
fat
volumes
one
of
which
i
took
down
and
saw
that
it
contained
similar
lists
running
back
several
years
i
noticed
on
macpherson
current
list
the
name
of
lord
semptam
an
eccentric
old
nobleman
whom
i
knew
slightly
then
turning
to
the
list
immediately
before
the
current
one
the
name
was
still
there
i
traced
it
back
through
list
after
list
until
i
found
the
first
entry
which
was
no
less
than
three
years
previous
and
there
lord
semptam
was
down
for
a
piece
of
furniture
costing
fifty
pounds
and
on
that
account
he
had
paid
a
pound
a
week
for
more
than
three
years
totalling
a
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
at
the
least
and
instantly
the
glorious
simplicity
of
the
scheme
dawned
upon
me
and
i
became
so
interested
in
the
swindle
that
i
lit
the
gas
fearing
my
little
lamp
would
be
exhausted
before
my
investigation
ended
for
it
promised
to
be
a
long
one
in
several
instances
the
intended
victim
proved
shrewder
than
old
simpson
had
counted
upon
and
the
word
had
been
written
on
the
line
carrying
the
name
when
the
exact
number
of
instalments
was
paid
but
as
these
shrewd
persons
dropped
out
others
took
their
places
and
simpson
dependence
on
their
seemed
to
be
justified
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
his
collectors
were
collecting
long
after
the
debt
had
been
paid
in
lord
semptam
case
the
payment
had
evidently
become
chronic
and
the
old
man
was
giving
away
his
pound
a
week
to
the
suave
macpherson
two
years
after
his
debt
had
been
liquidated
from
the
big
volume
i
detached
the
loose
leaf
dated
which
recorded
lord
semptam
purchase
of
a
carved
table
for
fifty
pounds
and
on
which
he
had
been
paying
a
pound
a
week
from
that
time
to
the
date
of
which
i
am
writing
which
was
november
this
single
document
taken
from
the
file
of
three
years
previous
was
not
likely
to
be
missed
as
would
have
been
the
case
if
i
had
selected
a
current
sheet
i
nevertheless
made
a
copy
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
macpherson
present
clients
then
carefully
placing
everything
exactly
as
i
had
found
it
i
extinguished
the
gas
and
went
out
of
the
shop
locking
the
door
behind
me
with
the
sheet
in
my
pocket
i
resolved
to
prepare
a
pleasant
little
surprise
for
my
suave
friend
macpherson
when
he
called
to
get
his
next
instalment
of
five
shillings
late
as
was
the
hour
when
i
reached
trafalgar
square
i
could
not
deprive
myself
of
the
felicity
of
calling
on
spenser
hale
who
i
knew
was
then
on
duty
he
never
appeared
at
his
best
during
office
hours
because
officialism
stiffened
his
stalwart
frame
mentally
he
was
impressed
with
the
importance
of
his
position
and
added
to
this
he
was
not
then
allowed
to
smoke
his
big
black
pipe
and
terrible
tobacco
he
received
me
with
the
curtness
i
had
been
taught
to
expect
when
i
inflicted
myself
upon
him
at
his
office
he
greeted
me
abruptly
with
say
valmont
how
long
do
you
expect
to
be
on
this
job
job
i
asked
mildly
you
know
what
i
mean
the
summertrees
affair
i
exclaimed
with
surprise
summertrees
case
is
already
completed
of
course
if
i
had
known
you
were
in
a
hurry
i
should
have
finished
up
everything
yesterday
but
as
you
and
podgers
and
i
do
know
how
many
more
have
been
at
it
sixteen
or
seventeen
days
if
not
longer
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
take
as
many
hours
as
i
am
working
entirely
alone
you
said
nothing
about
haste
you
know
come
now
valmont
that
a
bit
thick
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
already
got
evidence
against
the
man
absolute
and
complete
who
are
the
coiners
most
estimable
friend
how
often
have
i
told
you
not
to
jump
at
conclusions
i
informed
you
when
you
first
spoke
to
me
about
the
matter
that
summertrees
was
neither
a
coiner
nor
a
confederate
of
coiners
i
secured
evidence
sufficient
to
convict
him
of
quite
another
offence
which
is
probably
unique
in
the
annals
of
crime
i
have
penetrated
the
mystery
of
the
shop
and
discovered
the
reason
for
all
those
suspicious
actions
which
quite
properly
set
you
on
his
trail
now
i
wish
you
to
come
to
my
flat
next
wednesday
night
at
a
quarter
to
six
prepared
to
make
an
arrest
must
know
who
i
am
to
arrest
and
on
what
counts
so
hale
i
did
not
say
you
were
to
make
an
arrest
but
merely
warned
you
to
be
prepared
if
you
have
time
now
to
listen
to
the
disclosures
i
am
quite
at
your
service
i
promise
you
there
are
some
original
features
in
the
case
if
however
the
present
moment
is
inopportune
drop
in
on
me
at
your
convenience
previously
telephoning
so
that
you
may
know
whether
i
am
there
or
not
and
thus
your
valuable
time
will
not
be
expended
purposelessly
with
this
i
presented
to
him
my
most
courteous
bow
and
although
his
mystified
expression
hinted
a
suspicion
that
he
thought
i
was
chaffing
him
as
he
would
call
it
official
dignity
dissolved
somewhat
and
he
intimated
his
desire
to
hear
all
about
it
then
and
there
i
had
succeeded
in
arousing
my
friend
hale
curiosity
he
listened
to
the
evidence
with
perplexed
brow
and
at
last
ejaculated
he
would
be
blessed
young
man
i
said
in
conclusion
call
upon
me
at
six
on
wednesday
afternoon
to
receive
his
second
five
shillings
i
propose
that
you
in
your
uniform
shall
be
seated
there
with
me
to
receive
him
and
i
am
anxious
to
study
macpherson
countenance
when
he
realises
he
has
walked
in
to
confront
a
policeman
if
you
will
then
allow
me
to
him
for
a
few
moments
not
after
the
manner
of
scotland
yard
with
a
warning
lest
he
incriminate
himself
but
in
the
free
and
easy
fashion
we
adopt
in
paris
i
shall
afterwards
turn
the
case
over
to
you
to
be
dealt
with
at
your
discretion
have
a
wonderful
flow
of
language
monsieur
valmont
was
the
officer
tribute
to
me
shall
be
on
hand
at
a
quarter
to
six
on
wednesday
said
i
say
nothing
of
this
to
anyone
we
must
arrange
a
complete
surprise
for
macpherson
that
is
essential
please
make
no
move
in
the
matter
at
all
until
wednesday
night
spenser
hale
much
impressed
nodded
acquiescence
and
i
took
a
polite
leave
of
him
the
question
of
lighting
is
an
important
one
in
a
room
such
as
mine
and
electricity
offers
a
good
deal
of
scope
to
the
ingenious
of
this
fact
i
have
taken
full
advantage
i
can
manipulate
the
lighting
of
my
room
so
that
any
particular
spot
is
bathed
in
brilliancy
while
the
rest
of
the
space
remains
in
comparative
gloom
and
i
arranged
the
lamps
so
that
the
full
force
of
their
rays
impinged
against
the
door
that
wednesday
evening
while
i
sat
on
one
side
of
the
table
in
and
hale
sat
on
the
other
with
a
light
beating
down
on
him
from
above
which
gave
him
the
odd
sculptured
look
of
a
living
statue
of
justice
stern
and
triumphant
anyone
entering
the
room
would
first
be
dazzled
by
the
light
and
next
would
see
the
gigantic
form
of
hale
in
the
full
uniform
of
his
order
when
angus
macpherson
was
shown
into
this
room
he
was
quite
visibly
taken
aback
and
paused
abruptly
on
the
threshold
his
gaze
riveted
on
the
huge
policeman
i
think
his
first
purpose
was
to
turn
and
run
but
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
he
doubtless
heard
as
we
all
did
the
sound
of
the
bolt
being
thrust
in
its
place
thus
locking
him
in
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
expected
to
meet
mr
webster
as
he
said
this
i
pressed
the
button
under
my
table
and
was
instantly
enshrouded
with
light
a
sickly
smile
overspread
the
countenance
of
macpherson
as
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
he
made
a
very
creditable
attempt
to
carry
off
the
situation
with
nonchalance
there
you
are
webster
i
did
not
notice
you
at
first
it
was
a
tense
moment
i
spoke
slowly
and
impressively
perhaps
you
are
not
unacquainted
with
the
name
of
eugène
valmont
he
replied
brazenly
am
sorry
to
say
sir
i
never
heard
of
the
gentleman
before
at
this
came
a
most
inopportune
from
that
blockhead
spenser
hale
completely
spoiling
the
dramatic
situation
i
had
elaborated
with
such
thought
and
care
it
is
little
wonder
the
english
possess
no
drama
for
they
show
scant
appreciation
of
the
sensational
moments
in
life
brayed
spenser
hale
and
at
once
reduced
the
emotional
atmosphere
to
a
fog
of
commonplace
however
what
is
a
man
to
do
he
must
handle
the
tools
with
which
it
pleases
providence
to
provide
him
i
ignored
hale
untimely
laughter
down
sir
i
said
to
macpherson
and
he
obeyed
have
called
on
lord
semptam
this
week
i
continued
sternly
sir
collected
a
pound
from
him
sir
october
you
sold
lord
semptam
a
carved
antique
table
for
fifty
pounds
right
sir
you
were
here
last
week
you
gave
me
ralph
summertrees
as
the
name
of
a
gentleman
living
in
park
lane
you
knew
at
the
time
that
this
man
was
your
employer
macpherson
was
now
looking
fixedly
at
me
and
on
this
occasion
made
no
reply
i
went
on
calmly
also
knew
that
summertrees
of
park
lane
was
identical
with
simpson
of
tottenham
court
road
sir
said
macpherson
do
exactly
see
what
driving
at
but
it
quite
usual
for
a
man
to
carry
on
a
business
under
an
assumed
name
there
is
nothing
illegal
about
that
will
come
to
the
illegality
in
a
moment
macpherson
you
and
rogers
and
tyrrel
and
three
others
are
confederates
of
this
man
simpson
are
in
his
employ
yes
sir
but
no
more
confederates
than
clerks
usually
are
think
macpherson
i
have
said
enough
to
show
you
that
the
game
is
what
you
call
up
you
are
now
in
the
presence
of
spenser
hale
from
scotland
yard
who
is
waiting
to
hear
your
confession
here
the
stupid
hale
broke
in
with
his
remember
sir
that
anything
you
say
will
be
me
hale
i
interrupted
hastily
shall
turn
over
the
case
to
you
in
a
very
few
moments
but
i
ask
you
to
remember
our
compact
and
to
leave
it
for
the
present
entirely
in
my
hands
now
mr
macpherson
i
want
your
confession
and
i
want
it
at
once
confederates
protested
macpherson
with
admirably
simulated
surprise
must
say
you
use
extraordinary
terms
mr
mr
what
did
you
say
the
name
was
roared
hale
name
is
monsieur
valmont
implore
you
hale
to
leave
this
man
to
me
for
a
very
few
moments
now
macpherson
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
defence
nothing
criminal
has
been
alleged
monsieur
valmont
i
see
no
necessity
for
defence
if
you
wish
me
to
admit
that
somehow
you
have
acquired
a
number
of
details
regarding
our
business
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
so
and
to
subscribe
to
their
accuracy
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
let
me
know
of
what
you
complain
i
shall
endeavour
to
make
the
point
clear
to
you
if
i
can
there
has
evidently
been
some
misapprehension
but
for
the
life
of
me
without
further
explanation
i
am
as
much
in
a
fog
as
i
was
on
my
way
coming
here
for
it
is
getting
a
little
thick
outside
macpherson
certainly
was
conducting
himself
with
great
discretion
and
presented
quite
unconsciously
a
much
more
diplomatic
figure
than
my
friend
spenser
hale
sitting
stiffly
opposite
me
his
tone
was
one
of
mild
expostulation
mitigated
by
the
intimation
that
all
misunderstanding
speedily
would
be
cleared
away
to
outward
view
he
offered
a
perfect
picture
of
innocence
neither
protesting
too
much
nor
too
little
i
had
however
another
surprise
in
store
for
him
a
trump
card
as
it
were
and
i
played
it
down
on
the
table
i
cried
with
vim
you
ever
seen
that
sheet
before
he
glanced
at
it
without
offering
to
take
it
in
his
hand
yes
he
said
has
been
abstracted
from
our
file
it
is
what
i
call
my
visiting
list
come
sir
i
cried
sternly
refuse
to
confess
but
i
warn
you
we
know
all
about
it
you
never
heard
of
willoughby
i
suppose
he
is
the
author
of
the
silly
pamphlet
on
christian
science
are
in
the
right
macpherson
on
christian
science
and
i
have
read
it
for
a
long
while
you
ever
met
this
learned
doctor
mr
macpherson
yes
willoughby
is
the
of
summertrees
he
believes
in
christian
science
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
writes
about
it
really
we
are
getting
your
confession
bit
by
bit
macpherson
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
be
quite
frank
with
us
was
just
going
to
make
the
same
suggestion
to
you
monsieur
valmont
if
you
will
tell
me
in
a
few
words
exactly
what
is
your
charge
against
either
summertrees
or
myself
i
will
know
then
what
to
say
charge
you
sir
with
obtaining
money
under
false
pretences
which
is
a
crime
that
has
landed
more
than
one
distinguished
financier
in
prison
spenser
hale
shook
his
fat
forefinger
at
me
and
said
tut
valmont
we
must
threaten
we
must
threaten
you
know
but
i
went
on
without
heeding
him
for
instance
lord
semptam
you
sold
him
a
table
for
fifty
pounds
on
the
instalment
plan
he
was
to
pay
a
pound
a
week
and
in
less
than
a
year
the
debt
was
liquidated
but
he
is
an
man
as
all
your
clients
are
that
is
why
you
came
to
me
i
had
answered
the
bogus
willoughby
advertisement
and
so
you
kept
on
collecting
and
collecting
for
something
more
than
three
years
now
do
you
understand
the
charge
macpherson
head
during
this
accusation
was
held
slightly
inclined
to
one
side
at
first
his
face
was
clouded
by
the
most
clever
imitation
of
anxious
concentration
of
mind
i
had
ever
seen
and
this
was
gradually
cleared
away
by
the
dawn
of
awakening
perception
when
i
had
finished
an
ingratiating
smile
hovered
about
his
lips
you
know
he
said
is
rather
a
capital
scheme
the
league
as
one
might
call
them
most
ingenious
summertrees
if
he
had
any
sense
of
humour
which
he
has
would
be
rather
taken
by
the
idea
that
his
innocent
fad
for
christian
science
had
led
him
to
be
suspected
of
obtaining
money
under
false
pretences
but
really
there
are
no
pretensions
about
the
matter
at
all
as
i
understand
it
i
simply
call
and
receive
the
money
through
the
forgetfulness
of
the
persons
on
my
list
but
where
i
think
you
would
have
both
summertrees
and
myself
if
there
was
anything
in
your
audacious
theory
would
be
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
still
i
quite
see
how
the
mistake
arises
you
have
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
we
sold
nothing
to
lord
semptam
except
that
carved
table
three
years
ago
i
have
pleasure
in
pointing
out
to
you
that
his
lordship
is
a
frequent
customer
of
ours
and
has
had
many
things
from
us
at
one
time
or
another
sometimes
he
is
in
our
debt
sometimes
we
are
in
his
we
keep
a
sort
of
running
contract
with
him
by
which
he
pays
us
a
pound
a
week
he
and
several
other
customers
deal
on
the
same
plan
and
in
return
for
an
income
that
we
can
count
upon
they
get
the
first
offer
of
anything
in
which
they
are
supposed
to
be
interested
as
i
have
told
you
we
call
these
sheets
in
the
office
our
visiting
lists
but
to
make
the
visiting
lists
complete
you
need
what
we
term
our
encyclopaedia
we
call
it
that
because
it
is
in
so
many
volumes
a
volume
for
each
year
running
back
i
do
know
how
long
you
will
notice
little
figures
here
from
time
to
time
above
the
amount
stated
on
this
visiting
list
these
figures
refer
to
the
page
of
the
encyclopaedia
for
the
current
year
and
on
that
page
is
noted
the
new
sale
and
the
amount
of
it
as
it
might
be
set
down
say
in
a
ledger
is
a
very
entertaining
explanation
macpherson
i
suppose
this
encyclopaedia
as
you
call
it
is
in
the
shop
at
tottenham
court
road
no
sir
each
volume
of
the
encyclopaedia
is
these
books
contain
the
real
secret
of
our
business
and
they
are
kept
in
the
safe
at
summertrees
house
in
park
lane
take
lord
account
for
instance
you
will
find
in
faint
figures
under
a
certain
date
if
you
turn
to
page
of
the
encyclopaedia
for
that
year
you
will
then
see
a
list
of
what
lord
semptam
has
bought
and
the
prices
he
was
charged
for
them
it
is
really
a
very
simple
matter
if
you
will
allow
me
to
use
your
telephone
for
a
moment
i
will
ask
mr
summertrees
who
has
not
yet
begun
dinner
to
bring
with
him
here
the
volume
for
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
will
be
perfectly
satisfied
that
everything
is
quite
legitimate
i
confess
that
the
young
man
naturalness
and
confidence
staggered
me
the
more
so
as
i
saw
by
the
sarcastic
smile
on
hale
lips
that
he
did
not
believe
a
single
word
spoken
a
portable
telephone
stood
on
the
table
and
as
macpherson
finished
his
explanation
he
reached
over
and
drew
it
towards
him
then
spenser
hale
interfered
he
said
do
the
telephoning
what
is
the
call
number
of
mr
summertrees
hyde
park
hale
at
once
called
up
central
and
presently
was
answered
from
park
lane
we
heard
him
say
this
the
residence
of
summertrees
oh
is
that
you
podgers
is
summertrees
in
very
well
this
is
hale
i
am
in
flat
imperial
flats
you
know
yes
where
you
went
with
me
the
other
day
very
well
go
to
summertrees
and
say
to
him
that
mr
macpherson
wants
the
encyclopaedia
for
do
you
get
that
yes
encyclopaedia
oh
he
understand
what
it
is
macpherson
no
do
mention
my
name
at
all
just
say
macpherson
wants
the
encyclopaedia
for
the
year
and
that
you
are
to
bring
it
yes
you
may
tell
him
that
macpherson
is
at
imperial
flats
but
mention
my
name
at
all
exactly
as
soon
as
he
gives
you
the
book
get
into
a
cab
and
come
here
as
quickly
as
possible
with
it
if
summertrees
does
want
to
let
the
book
go
then
tell
him
to
come
with
you
if
he
wo
do
that
place
him
under
arrest
and
bring
both
him
and
the
book
here
all
right
be
as
quick
as
you
can
waiting
macpherson
made
no
protest
against
hale
use
of
the
telephone
he
merely
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
a
resigned
expression
on
his
face
which
if
painted
on
canvas
might
have
been
entitled
falsely
accused
when
hale
rang
off
macpherson
said
course
you
know
your
own
business
best
but
if
your
man
arrests
summertrees
he
will
make
you
the
of
london
there
is
such
a
thing
as
unjustifiable
arrest
as
well
as
getting
money
under
false
pretences
and
summertrees
is
not
the
man
to
forgive
an
insult
and
then
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
the
more
i
think
over
your
theory
the
more
absolutely
grotesque
it
seems
and
if
the
case
ever
gets
into
the
newspapers
i
am
sure
mr
hale
you
experience
an
uncomfortable
with
your
chiefs
at
scotland
yard
take
the
risk
of
that
thank
you
said
hale
stubbornly
i
to
consider
myself
under
arrest
inquired
the
young
man
sir
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
shall
withdraw
summertrees
will
show
you
everything
you
wish
to
see
in
his
books
and
can
explain
his
business
much
more
capably
than
i
because
he
knows
more
about
it
therefore
gentlemen
i
bid
you
you
do
not
just
yet
awhile
exclaimed
hale
rising
to
his
feet
simultaneously
with
the
young
man
i
under
arrest
protested
macpherson
not
going
to
leave
this
room
until
podgers
brings
that
book
very
well
and
he
sat
down
again
and
now
as
talking
is
dry
work
i
set
out
something
to
drink
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
box
of
cigarettes
hale
mixed
his
favourite
brew
but
macpherson
shunning
the
wine
of
his
country
contented
himself
with
a
glass
of
plain
mineral
water
and
lit
a
cigarette
then
he
awoke
my
high
regard
by
saying
pleasantly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
we
are
waiting
monsieur
valmont
may
i
remind
you
that
you
owe
me
five
shillings
i
laughed
took
the
coin
from
my
pocket
and
paid
him
whereupon
he
thanked
me
you
connected
with
scotland
yard
monsieur
valmont
asked
macpherson
with
the
air
of
a
man
trying
to
make
conversation
to
bridge
over
a
tedious
interval
but
before
i
could
reply
hale
blurted
out
likely
have
no
official
standing
as
a
detective
then
monsieur
valmont
whatever
i
replied
quickly
thus
getting
in
my
oar
ahead
of
hale
is
a
loss
to
our
country
pursued
this
admirable
young
man
with
evident
sincerity
i
began
to
see
i
could
make
a
good
deal
of
so
clever
a
fellow
if
he
came
under
my
tuition
blunders
of
our
police
he
went
on
something
deplorable
if
they
would
but
take
lessons
in
strategy
say
from
france
their
unpleasant
duties
would
be
so
much
more
acceptably
performed
with
much
less
discomfort
to
their
victims
snorted
hale
in
derision
they
call
a
man
guilty
there
until
he
proven
innocent
hale
and
the
same
seems
to
be
the
case
in
imperial
flats
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
that
summertrees
is
guilty
and
will
not
be
content
until
he
proves
his
innocence
i
venture
to
predict
that
you
will
hear
from
him
before
long
in
a
manner
that
may
astonish
you
hale
grunted
and
looked
at
his
watch
the
minutes
passed
very
slowly
as
we
sat
there
smoking
and
at
last
even
i
began
to
get
uneasy
macpherson
seeing
our
anxiety
said
that
when
he
came
in
the
fog
was
almost
as
thick
as
it
had
been
the
week
before
and
that
there
might
be
some
difficulty
in
getting
a
cab
just
as
he
was
speaking
the
door
was
unlocked
from
the
outside
and
podgers
entered
bearing
a
thick
volume
in
his
hand
this
he
gave
to
his
superior
who
turned
over
its
pages
in
amazement
and
then
looked
at
the
back
crying
of
what
sort
of
a
joke
is
this
mr
macpherson
there
was
a
pained
look
on
macpherson
face
as
he
reached
forward
and
took
the
book
he
said
with
a
sigh
you
had
allowed
me
to
telephone
hale
i
should
have
made
it
perfectly
plain
to
summertrees
what
was
wanted
i
might
have
known
this
mistake
was
liable
to
occur
there
is
an
increasing
demand
for
books
of
sport
and
no
doubt
summertrees
thought
this
was
what
i
meant
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
send
your
man
back
to
park
lane
and
tell
summertrees
that
what
we
want
is
the
locked
volume
of
accounts
for
which
we
call
the
encyclopaedia
allow
me
to
write
an
order
that
will
bring
it
oh
i
show
you
what
i
have
written
before
your
man
takes
it
he
said
as
hale
stood
ready
to
look
over
his
shoulder
on
my
notepaper
he
dashed
off
a
request
such
as
he
had
outlined
and
handed
it
to
hale
who
read
it
and
gave
it
to
podgers
that
to
summertrees
and
get
back
as
quickly
as
possible
have
you
a
cab
at
the
door
sir
it
foggy
outside
so
much
sir
as
it
was
an
hour
ago
no
difficulty
about
the
traffic
now
sir
well
get
back
as
soon
as
you
can
podgers
saluted
and
left
with
the
book
under
his
arm
again
the
door
was
locked
and
again
we
sat
smoking
in
silence
until
the
stillness
was
broken
by
the
tinkle
of
the
telephone
hale
put
the
receiver
to
his
ear
this
is
the
imperial
flats
yes
valmont
oh
yes
macpherson
is
here
what
out
of
what
ca
hear
you
out
of
print
what
the
encyclopaedia
out
of
print
who
is
that
speaking
willoughby
thanks
macpherson
rose
as
if
he
would
go
to
the
telephone
but
instead
and
he
acted
so
quietly
that
i
did
not
notice
what
he
was
doing
until
the
thing
was
done
he
picked
up
the
sheet
which
he
called
his
visiting
list
and
walking
quite
without
haste
held
it
in
the
glowing
coals
of
the
fireplace
until
it
disappeared
in
a
flash
of
flame
up
the
chimney
i
sprang
to
my
feet
indignant
but
too
late
to
make
even
a
motion
outwards
saving
the
sheet
macpherson
regarded
us
both
with
that
smile
which
had
several
times
lighted
up
his
face
dared
you
burn
that
sheet
i
demanded
monsieur
valmont
it
did
not
belong
to
you
because
you
do
not
belong
to
scotland
yard
because
you
stole
it
because
you
had
no
right
to
it
and
because
you
have
no
official
standing
in
this
country
if
it
had
been
in
hale
possession
i
should
not
have
dared
as
you
put
it
to
destroy
the
sheet
but
as
this
sheet
was
abstracted
from
my
master
premises
by
you
an
entirely
unauthorised
person
whom
he
would
have
been
justified
in
shooting
dead
if
he
had
found
you
housebreaking
and
you
had
resisted
him
on
his
discovery
i
took
the
liberty
of
destroying
the
document
i
have
always
held
that
these
sheets
should
not
have
been
kept
for
as
has
been
the
case
if
they
fell
under
the
scrutiny
of
so
intelligent
a
person
as
eugène
valmont
improper
inferences
might
have
been
drawn
summertrees
however
persisted
in
keeping
them
but
made
this
concession
that
if
i
ever
telegraphed
him
or
telephoned
him
the
word
encyclopaedia
he
would
at
once
burn
these
records
and
he
on
his
part
was
to
telegraph
or
telephone
to
me
the
is
out
of
print
whereupon
i
would
know
that
he
had
succeeded
gentlemen
open
this
door
which
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
forcing
it
either
put
me
formally
under
arrest
or
cease
to
restrict
my
liberty
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
hale
for
telephoning
and
i
have
made
no
protest
to
so
gallant
a
host
as
monsieur
valmont
is
because
of
the
locked
door
however
the
farce
is
now
terminated
the
proceedings
i
have
sat
through
were
entirely
illegal
and
if
you
will
pardon
me
hale
they
have
been
a
little
too
french
to
go
down
here
in
old
england
or
to
make
a
report
in
the
newspapers
that
would
be
quite
satisfactory
to
your
chiefs
i
demand
either
my
formal
arrest
or
the
unlocking
of
that
door
in
silence
i
pressed
a
button
and
my
man
threw
open
the
door
macpherson
walked
to
the
threshold
paused
and
looked
back
at
spenser
hale
who
sat
there
silent
as
a
sphinx
mr
hale
there
being
no
reply
he
turned
to
me
with
the
same
ingratiating
smile
monsieur
eugène
valmont
he
said
shall
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
next
wednesday
at
six
for
my
five
shillings
ghost
with
the
celebrated
critics
have
written
with
scorn
of
what
they
call
long
arm
of
coincidence
in
fiction
coincidence
is
supposed
to
be
the
device
of
a
novelist
who
does
not
possess
ingenuity
enough
to
construct
a
book
without
it
in
france
our
incomparable
writers
pay
no
attention
to
this
because
they
are
gifted
with
a
keener
insight
into
real
life
than
is
the
case
with
the
british
the
superb
charles
dickens
possibly
as
well
known
in
france
as
he
is
wherever
the
english
language
is
read
and
who
loved
french
soil
and
the
french
people
probably
probed
deeper
into
the
intricacies
of
human
character
than
any
other
novelist
of
modern
times
and
if
you
read
his
works
you
will
see
that
he
continually
makes
use
of
coincidence
the
experience
that
has
come
to
me
throughout
my
own
strange
and
varied
career
convinces
me
that
coincidence
happens
in
real
life
with
exceeding
frequency
and
this
fact
is
especially
borne
in
upon
me
when
i
set
out
to
relate
my
conflict
with
the
rantremly
ghost
which
wrought
startling
changes
upon
the
lives
of
two
people
one
an
objectionable
domineering
man
and
the
other
a
humble
and
crushed
woman
of
course
there
was
a
third
person
and
the
consequences
that
came
to
him
were
the
most
striking
of
all
as
you
will
learn
if
you
do
me
the
honour
to
read
this
account
of
the
episode
so
far
as
coincidence
is
concerned
there
was
first
the
arrival
of
the
newspaper
clipping
then
the
coming
of
sophia
brooks
and
when
that
woman
left
my
flat
i
wrote
down
this
sentence
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
week
is
out
i
predict
that
lord
rantremly
himself
will
call
to
see
me
next
day
my
servant
brought
in
the
card
of
lord
rantremly
i
must
begin
with
the
visit
of
sophia
brooks
for
though
that
comes
second
yet
i
had
paid
no
attention
in
particular
to
the
newspaper
clipping
until
the
lady
told
her
story
my
man
brought
me
a
typewritten
sheet
of
paper
on
which
were
inscribed
the
words
brooks
typewriting
and
translating
office
first
floor
no
beaumont
street
strand
london
i
said
to
my
servant
the
lady
as
kindly
as
possible
that
i
have
no
typewriting
work
to
give
out
and
that
in
fact
i
keep
a
stenographer
and
typewriting
machine
on
the
premises
a
few
moments
later
my
man
returned
and
said
the
lady
wished
to
see
me
not
about
typewriting
but
regarding
a
case
in
which
she
hoped
to
interest
me
i
was
still
in
some
hesitation
about
admitting
her
for
my
transactions
had
now
risen
to
a
higher
plane
than
when
i
was
new
to
london
my
expenses
were
naturally
very
heavy
and
it
was
not
possible
for
me
in
justice
to
myself
to
waste
time
in
commissions
from
the
poor
which
even
if
they
resulted
successfully
meant
little
money
added
to
my
banking
account
and
often
nothing
at
all
because
the
client
was
unable
to
pay
as
i
remarked
before
i
possess
a
heart
the
most
tender
and
therefore
must
greatly
to
my
grief
steel
myself
against
the
enlisting
of
my
sympathy
which
alas
has
frequently
led
to
my
financial
loss
still
sometimes
the
apparently
poor
are
involved
in
matters
of
extreme
importance
and
england
is
so
eccentric
a
country
that
one
may
find
himself
at
fault
if
he
closes
his
door
too
harshly
indeed
ever
since
my
servant
in
the
utmost
good
faith
threw
downstairs
the
persistent
and
tattered
who
he
learned
later
to
his
sorrow
was
actually
his
grace
the
duke
of
ventnor
i
have
always
cautioned
my
subordinates
not
to
judge
too
hastily
from
appearances
the
lady
in
i
said
and
there
came
to
me
hesitating
backward
abashed
a
woman
dressed
with
distressing
plainness
when
one
thinks
of
the
charming
costumes
to
be
seen
on
a
parisian
boulevard
her
subdued
manner
was
that
of
one
to
whom
the
world
had
been
cruel
i
rose
bowed
profoundly
and
placed
a
chair
at
her
disposal
with
the
air
i
should
have
used
if
my
caller
had
been
a
royal
princess
i
claim
no
credit
for
this
it
is
of
my
nature
there
you
behold
eugène
valmont
my
visitor
was
a
woman
i
said
politely
what
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
serving
you
the
poor
woman
seemed
for
the
moment
confused
and
was
i
feared
on
the
verge
of
tears
but
at
last
she
spoke
and
said
you
have
read
in
the
newspapers
of
the
tragedy
at
rantremly
castle
name
madam
remains
in
my
memory
associated
elusively
with
some
hint
of
seriousness
will
you
pardon
me
a
moment
and
a
vague
thought
that
i
had
seen
the
castle
mentioned
either
in
a
newspaper
or
a
clipping
from
one
caused
me
to
pick
up
the
latest
bunch
which
had
come
from
my
agent
i
am
imbued
with
no
vanity
at
all
still
it
is
amusing
to
note
what
the
newspapers
say
of
one
and
therefore
i
have
subscribed
to
a
clipping
agency
in
fact
i
indulge
in
two
subscriptions
one
personal
the
other
calling
for
any
pronouncement
pertaining
to
the
differences
between
england
and
france
for
it
is
my
determination
yet
to
write
a
book
on
the
comparative
characteristics
of
the
two
people
i
hold
a
theory
that
the
english
people
are
utterly
incomprehensible
to
the
rest
of
humanity
and
this
will
be
duly
set
out
in
my
forthcoming
volume
i
speedily
found
the
clipping
i
was
in
search
of
it
proved
to
be
a
letter
to
the
and
was
headed
destruction
of
rantremly
castle
the
letter
went
on
to
say
that
this
edifice
was
one
of
the
most
noted
examples
of
norman
architecture
in
the
north
of
england
that
charles
ii
had
hidden
there
for
some
days
after
his
disastrous
defeat
at
worcester
part
of
the
castle
had
been
battered
down
by
cromwell
and
later
it
again
proved
the
refuge
of
a
stuart
when
the
pretender
made
it
a
temporary
place
of
concealment
the
new
lord
rantremly
it
seemed
had
determined
to
demolish
this
ancient
stronghold
so
interesting
architecturally
and
historically
and
to
build
with
its
stones
a
modern
residence
against
this
act
of
vandalism
the
writer
strongly
protested
and
suggested
that
england
should
acquire
the
power
which
france
constantly
exerts
in
making
an
historical
monument
of
an
edifice
so
interwoven
with
the
fortunes
of
the
country
madam
i
said
this
extract
alludes
to
is
the
coming
demolition
of
rantremly
castle
is
that
the
tragedy
of
which
you
speak
no
she
exclaimed
mean
the
death
of
the
eleventh
lord
rantremly
about
six
weeks
ago
for
ten
years
lord
rantremly
lived
practically
alone
in
the
castle
servants
would
not
remain
there
because
the
place
was
haunted
and
well
it
may
be
for
a
terrible
family
the
rantremlys
have
been
and
a
cruel
as
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
up
to
a
month
and
a
half
ago
lord
rantremly
was
waited
on
by
a
butler
older
than
himself
and
if
possible
more
wicked
one
morning
this
old
butler
came
up
the
stairs
from
the
kitchen
with
lord
rantremly
breakfast
on
a
silver
tray
as
was
his
custom
his
lordship
always
partook
of
breakfast
in
his
own
room
it
is
not
known
how
the
accident
happened
as
the
old
servant
was
going
up
the
stairs
instead
of
coming
down
but
the
steps
are
very
smooth
and
slippery
and
without
a
carpet
at
any
rate
he
seems
to
have
fallen
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
and
lay
there
with
a
broken
neck
lord
rantremly
who
was
very
deaf
seemingly
did
not
hear
the
crash
and
it
is
supposed
that
after
ringing
and
ringing
in
vain
and
doubtless
working
himself
into
a
violent
fit
of
temper
alas
too
frequent
an
occurrence
the
old
nobleman
got
out
of
bed
and
walked
barefooted
down
the
stair
coming
at
last
upon
the
body
of
his
ancient
servant
there
the
man
who
arrived
every
morning
to
light
the
fires
found
them
the
servant
dead
and
lord
rantremly
helpless
from
an
attack
of
paralysis
the
physicians
say
that
only
his
eyes
seemed
alive
and
they
were
filled
with
a
great
fear
and
indeed
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
after
his
wicked
wicked
life
his
right
hand
was
but
partially
disabled
and
with
that
he
tried
to
scribble
something
which
proved
indecipherable
and
so
he
died
and
those
who
attended
him
at
his
last
moments
say
that
if
ever
a
soul
had
a
taste
of
future
punishment
before
it
left
this
earth
it
was
the
soul
of
lord
rantremly
as
it
shone
through
those
eyes
here
the
woman
stopped
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
as
if
the
fear
of
that
grim
had
communicated
itself
to
her
i
interjected
calmness
into
an
emotional
situation
by
remarking
in
a
commonplace
tone
it
is
the
present
lord
rantremly
who
proposes
to
destroy
the
castle
i
suppose
he
the
son
of
the
late
lord
he
is
a
distant
relative
the
branch
of
the
family
to
which
he
belongs
has
been
engaged
in
commerce
and
i
believe
its
members
are
very
wealthy
madam
no
doubt
this
is
all
extremely
interesting
and
rather
gruesome
in
what
way
are
you
concerned
in
these
occurrences
years
ago
i
replied
to
an
advertisement
there
being
required
one
who
knew
shorthand
who
possessed
a
typewriting
machine
and
a
knowledge
of
french
to
act
as
secretary
to
a
nobleman
i
was
at
that
time
years
old
and
for
two
years
had
been
trying
to
earn
my
living
in
london
through
the
typing
of
manuscript
but
i
was
making
a
hard
struggle
of
it
so
i
applied
for
this
position
and
got
it
there
are
in
the
library
of
rantremly
castle
many
documents
relating
to
the
stuart
exile
in
france
his
lordship
wished
these
documents
sorted
and
catalogued
as
well
as
copies
taken
of
each
many
of
the
letters
were
in
the
french
language
and
these
i
was
required
to
translate
and
type
it
was
a
sombre
place
of
residence
but
the
salary
was
good
and
i
saw
before
me
work
enough
to
keep
me
busy
for
years
besides
this
the
task
was
extremely
congenial
and
i
became
absorbed
in
it
being
young
and
romantically
inclined
here
i
seemed
to
live
in
the
midst
of
these
wonderful
intrigues
of
long
ago
documents
passed
through
my
hands
whose
very
possession
at
one
period
meant
capital
danger
bringing
up
even
now
visions
of
block
axe
and
masked
headsman
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
so
sinister
a
man
as
lord
rantremly
who
i
had
heard
cared
for
nothing
but
drink
and
gambling
should
have
desired
to
promote
this
historical
research
and
indeed
i
soon
found
he
felt
nothing
but
contempt
for
it
however
he
had
undertaken
it
at
the
instance
of
his
only
son
then
a
young
man
of
my
own
age
at
oxford
university
rantremly
at
that
time
was
years
old
his
countenance
was
dark
harsh
and
imperious
and
his
language
brutal
he
indulged
in
frightful
outbursts
of
temper
but
he
paid
so
well
for
service
that
there
was
no
lack
of
it
as
there
has
been
since
the
ghost
appeared
some
years
ago
he
was
very
tall
and
of
commanding
appearance
but
had
a
deformity
in
the
shape
of
a
and
walked
with
the
halting
step
of
those
so
afflicted
there
were
at
that
time
servants
in
plenty
at
the
castle
for
although
a
tradition
existed
that
the
ghost
of
the
founder
of
the
house
trod
certain
rooms
this
ghost
it
was
said
never
demonstrated
its
presence
when
the
living
representative
of
the
family
was
a
man
with
a
tradition
further
affirmed
that
if
this
ghost
allowed
its
halting
footsteps
to
be
heard
while
the
reigning
lord
possessed
a
similar
deformity
the
conjunction
foreshadowed
the
passing
of
title
and
estates
to
a
stranger
the
ghost
haunted
the
castle
only
when
it
was
occupied
by
a
descendant
whose
two
feet
were
normal
it
seems
that
the
founder
of
the
house
was
a
man
and
this
disagreeable
peculiarity
often
missed
one
generation
and
sometimes
two
while
at
other
times
both
father
and
son
had
as
was
the
case
with
the
late
lord
rantremly
and
the
young
man
at
oxford
i
am
not
a
believer
in
the
supernatural
of
course
but
nevertheless
it
is
strange
that
within
the
past
few
years
everyone
residing
in
the
castle
has
heard
the
ghost
and
now
title
and
estates
descend
to
a
family
that
were
utter
strangers
to
the
rantremlys
madam
this
also
sounds
most
alluring
and
were
my
time
not
taken
up
with
affairs
more
material
than
those
to
which
you
allude
i
should
be
content
to
listen
all
day
but
as
it
is
i
spread
my
hands
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
the
woman
with
a
deep
sigh
said
am
sorry
to
have
taken
so
long
but
i
wished
you
to
understand
the
situation
and
now
i
will
come
direct
to
the
heart
of
the
case
i
worked
alone
in
the
library
as
i
told
you
much
interested
in
what
i
was
doing
the
chaplain
a
great
friend
of
lord
rantremly
son
and
indeed
a
former
tutor
of
his
assisted
me
with
the
documents
that
were
in
latin
and
a
friendship
sprang
up
between
us
he
was
an
elderly
man
and
extremely
unworldly
lord
rantremly
never
concealed
his
scorn
of
this
clergyman
but
did
not
interfere
with
him
because
of
the
son
work
went
on
very
pleasantly
up
to
the
time
that
reginald
the
heir
of
his
lordship
came
down
from
oxford
then
began
the
happiest
days
of
a
life
that
has
been
otherwise
full
of
hardships
and
distress
reginald
was
as
different
as
possible
from
his
father
in
one
respect
only
did
he
bear
any
resemblance
to
that
terrible
old
man
and
this
resemblance
was
the
deformity
of
a
a
blemish
which
one
soon
forgot
when
one
came
to
know
the
gentle
and
nature
of
the
young
man
as
i
have
said
it
was
at
his
instance
that
lord
rantremly
had
engaged
me
to
set
in
order
those
historical
papers
reginald
became
enthusiastic
at
the
progress
i
had
made
and
thus
the
young
nobleman
the
chaplain
and
myself
continued
our
work
together
with
enthusiasm
cut
short
a
recital
which
must
be
trying
to
your
patience
but
which
is
necessary
if
you
are
to
understand
the
situation
i
may
say
that
our
companionship
resulted
in
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
me
which
i
foolishly
perhaps
and
selfishly
it
may
be
accepted
reginald
knew
that
his
father
would
never
consent
but
we
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
the
chaplain
and
he
mild
unworldly
man
married
us
one
day
in
the
consecrated
chapel
of
the
castle
i
have
told
you
the
house
at
that
time
contained
many
servants
and
i
think
without
being
sure
that
the
butler
whom
i
feared
even
more
than
lord
rantremly
himself
got
some
inkling
of
what
was
going
forward
but
be
that
as
it
may
he
and
his
lordship
entered
the
chapel
just
as
the
ceremony
was
finished
and
there
followed
an
agonising
scene
his
lordship
flung
the
ancient
chaplain
from
his
place
and
when
reginald
attempted
to
interfere
the
maddened
nobleman
struck
his
son
full
in
the
face
with
his
clenched
fist
and
my
husband
lay
as
one
dead
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
chapel
by
this
time
the
butler
had
locked
the
doors
and
had
rudely
torn
the
vestments
from
the
aged
clergyman
and
with
these
tied
him
hand
and
foot
all
this
took
place
in
a
very
few
moments
and
i
stood
there
as
one
paralysed
unable
either
to
speak
or
scream
not
that
screaming
would
have
done
me
any
good
in
that
horrible
place
of
thick
walls
the
butler
produced
a
key
and
unlocked
a
small
private
door
at
the
side
of
the
chapel
which
led
from
the
apartments
of
his
lordship
to
the
family
pew
then
taking
my
husband
by
feet
and
shoulders
lord
rantremly
and
the
butler
carried
him
out
locking
the
door
and
leaving
the
clergyman
and
me
prisoners
in
the
chapel
the
reverend
old
gentleman
took
no
notice
of
me
he
seemed
to
be
dazed
and
when
at
last
i
found
my
voice
and
addressed
him
he
merely
murmured
over
and
over
texts
of
scripture
pertaining
to
the
marriage
service
a
short
time
i
heard
the
key
turn
again
in
the
lock
of
the
private
door
and
the
butler
entered
alone
he
unloosened
the
bands
around
the
clergyman
knees
escorted
him
out
and
once
more
locked
the
door
behind
him
a
third
time
that
terrible
servant
came
back
grasped
me
roughly
by
the
wrist
and
without
a
word
dragged
me
with
him
along
a
narrow
passage
up
a
stair
and
finally
to
the
main
hall
and
so
to
my
lord
private
study
which
adjoined
his
bedroom
and
there
on
a
table
i
found
my
typewriting
machine
brought
up
from
the
library
have
but
the
most
confused
recollection
of
what
took
place
i
am
not
a
courageous
woman
and
was
in
mortal
terror
both
of
lord
rantremly
and
his
attendant
his
lordship
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
and
when
i
came
in
used
the
most
unseemly
language
to
me
then
ordered
me
to
write
at
his
dictation
swearing
that
if
i
did
not
do
exactly
as
he
told
me
he
would
finish
his
son
as
he
put
it
i
sat
down
at
the
machine
and
he
dictated
a
letter
to
himself
demanding
two
thousand
pounds
to
be
paid
to
me
otherwise
i
should
claim
that
i
was
the
wife
of
his
son
secretly
married
this
placing
pen
and
ink
before
me
he
compelled
me
to
sign
and
when
i
had
done
so
pleading
to
be
allowed
to
see
my
husband
if
only
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
me
for
he
shook
his
fist
in
my
face
and
used
words
which
were
appalling
to
hear
that
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
lord
rantremly
my
husband
the
clergyman
or
the
butler
i
was
at
once
sent
off
to
london
with
my
belongings
the
butler
himself
buying
my
ticket
and
flinging
a
handful
of
sovereigns
into
my
lap
as
the
train
moved
out
here
the
woman
stopped
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to
weep
you
done
nothing
about
this
for
the
past
ten
years
she
shook
her
head
could
i
do
she
gasped
had
little
money
and
no
friends
who
would
believe
my
story
besides
this
lord
rantremly
retained
possession
of
a
letter
signed
by
myself
that
would
convict
me
of
attempted
blackmail
while
the
butler
would
swear
to
anything
against
me
have
no
marriage
certificate
of
course
has
become
of
the
clergyman
do
not
know
what
of
lord
rantremly
son
was
announced
that
he
had
gone
on
a
voyage
to
australia
for
his
health
in
a
sailing
ship
which
was
wrecked
on
the
african
coast
and
everyone
on
board
lost
is
your
own
theory
my
husband
was
killed
by
the
blow
given
him
in
the
chapel
that
does
not
seem
credible
a
blow
from
the
fist
seldom
kills
he
fell
backwards
and
his
head
struck
the
sharp
stone
steps
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
i
know
my
husband
was
dead
when
the
butler
and
his
father
carried
him
out
think
the
clergyman
was
also
murdered
am
sure
of
it
both
master
and
servant
were
capable
of
any
crime
or
cruelty
received
no
letters
from
the
young
man
you
see
during
our
short
friendship
we
were
constantly
together
and
there
was
no
need
of
correspondence
madam
what
do
you
expect
of
me
hoped
you
would
investigate
and
find
perhaps
where
reginald
and
the
clergyman
are
buried
i
realise
that
i
have
no
proof
but
in
that
way
my
strange
story
will
be
corroborated
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
and
looked
at
her
truth
to
tell
i
only
partially
credited
her
story
myself
and
yet
i
was
positive
she
believed
every
word
of
it
ten
years
brooding
on
a
fancied
injustice
by
a
woman
living
alone
and
doubtless
often
in
dire
poverty
had
mixed
together
the
actual
and
the
imaginary
until
now
what
had
possibly
been
an
aimless
flirtation
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
unexpectedly
discovered
by
the
father
had
formed
itself
into
the
tragedy
which
she
had
told
me
it
not
be
well
i
suggested
lay
the
facts
before
the
present
lord
rantremly
have
done
so
she
answered
simply
what
result
lordship
said
my
story
was
preposterous
in
examining
the
late
lord
private
papers
he
discovered
the
letter
which
i
typed
and
signed
he
said
very
coldly
that
the
fact
that
i
had
waited
until
everyone
who
could
corroborate
or
deny
my
story
was
dead
united
with
the
improbability
of
the
narrative
itself
would
very
likely
consign
me
to
prison
if
i
made
public
a
statement
so
incredible
you
know
madam
i
think
his
lordship
is
right
offered
me
an
annuity
of
fifty
pounds
which
i
refused
that
refusal
madam
i
think
you
are
wrong
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
accept
the
annuity
the
woman
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
is
not
money
i
am
after
she
said
god
knows
i
have
often
been
in
sore
need
of
it
but
i
am
the
countess
of
rantremly
and
i
wish
my
right
to
that
name
acknowledged
my
character
has
been
under
an
impalpable
shadow
for
ten
years
on
several
occasions
mysterious
hints
have
reached
me
that
in
some
manner
i
left
the
castle
under
a
cloud
if
lord
rantremly
will
destroy
the
letter
which
i
was
compelled
to
write
under
duress
and
if
he
will
give
me
written
acknowledgment
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
alleged
against
me
during
my
stay
in
the
castle
he
may
enjoy
his
money
in
peace
for
all
of
me
i
want
none
of
it
you
asked
him
to
do
this
he
refuses
to
give
up
or
destroy
the
letter
although
i
told
him
in
what
circumstances
it
had
been
written
but
desiring
to
be
fair
he
said
he
would
allow
me
a
pound
a
week
for
life
entirely
through
his
own
generosity
this
you
refused
i
refused
i
regret
to
say
that
i
can
not
see
my
way
to
do
anything
with
regard
to
what
i
admit
is
very
unjust
usage
we
have
absolutely
nothing
to
go
upon
except
your
unsupported
word
lord
rantremly
was
perfectly
right
when
he
said
no
one
would
credit
your
story
i
could
not
go
down
to
rantremly
castle
and
make
investigations
there
i
should
have
no
right
upon
the
premises
at
all
and
would
get
into
instant
trouble
as
an
interfering
trespasser
i
beg
you
to
heed
my
advice
and
accept
the
annuity
sophia
brooks
with
that
mild
obstinacy
of
which
i
had
received
indications
during
her
recital
slowly
shook
her
head
have
been
very
kind
to
listen
for
so
long
she
said
and
then
with
a
curt
turned
and
left
the
room
on
the
sheet
of
paper
underneath
her
address
i
wrote
this
prophecy
the
week
is
out
i
predict
that
lord
rantremly
himself
will
call
to
see
me
next
morning
at
almost
the
same
hour
that
miss
brooks
had
arrived
the
day
before
the
earl
of
rantremly
card
was
brought
in
to
me
his
lordship
proved
to
be
an
abrupt
dapper
business
man
i
should
call
him
as
there
was
every
reason
he
should
be
for
he
had
earned
his
own
fortune
he
was
doubtless
equally
proud
of
his
new
title
which
he
was
trying
to
live
up
to
assuming
now
and
then
a
haughty
domineering
attitude
and
again
relapsing
into
the
keen
incisive
manner
of
the
man
of
affairs
shrewd
financial
sense
waging
a
constant
struggle
with
the
glamour
of
an
ancient
name
i
am
sure
he
would
have
shone
to
better
advantage
either
as
a
financier
or
as
a
nobleman
but
the
combination
was
too
much
for
him
i
formed
an
instinctive
dislike
to
the
man
which
probably
would
not
have
happened
had
he
been
wearing
the
title
for
twenty
years
or
had
i
met
him
as
a
business
man
with
no
thought
of
the
aristocratic
honour
awaiting
him
there
seemed
nothing
in
common
between
him
and
the
former
holder
of
the
title
he
had
keen
ferrety
eyes
a
sharp
financial
nose
a
line
of
mouth
which
indicated
little
of
human
kindness
he
was
short
of
stature
but
he
did
not
possess
the
which
was
one
advantage
he
seated
himself
before
i
had
time
to
offer
him
a
chair
and
kept
on
his
hat
in
my
presence
which
he
would
not
have
done
if
he
had
either
been
a
genuine
nobleman
or
a
courteous
business
man
am
lord
rantremly
he
announced
pompously
which
announcement
was
quite
unnecessary
because
i
held
his
card
in
my
hand
so
my
lord
and
you
have
come
to
learn
whether
or
no
i
can
lay
the
ghost
in
that
old
castle
to
the
north
which
bears
your
name
i
blessed
cried
his
lordship
agape
could
you
guess
that
it
is
not
a
guess
but
rather
a
choice
of
two
objects
either
of
which
might
bring
you
to
my
rooms
i
chose
the
first
motive
because
i
thought
you
might
prefer
to
arrange
the
second
problem
with
your
solicitor
and
he
doubtless
told
you
that
miss
sophia
brooks
claim
was
absurd
that
you
were
quite
right
in
refusing
to
give
up
or
destroy
the
typewritten
letter
she
had
signed
ten
years
ago
and
that
it
was
weakness
on
your
part
without
consulting
him
to
offer
her
an
annuity
of
pounds
a
year
long
before
this
harangue
was
finished
which
i
uttered
in
an
easy
and
nonchalant
tone
of
voice
as
if
reciting
something
that
everybody
knew
his
lordship
stood
on
his
feet
again
staring
at
me
like
a
man
thunderstruck
this
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
exercising
that
politeness
which
his
abrupt
entrance
and
demeanour
had
forestalled
i
rose
and
bowing
said
pray
you
to
be
seated
my
lord
he
dropped
into
the
chair
rather
than
sat
down
in
it
now
i
continued
with
the
utmost
suavity
stretching
forth
my
hand
i
place
your
hat
on
this
shelf
out
of
the
way
where
it
will
not
incommode
you
during
our
discourse
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
took
his
hat
from
his
head
and
passively
handed
it
to
me
and
after
placing
it
in
safety
i
resumed
my
chair
with
the
comfortable
feeling
that
his
lordship
and
i
were
much
nearer
a
plane
of
equality
than
when
he
entered
the
room
about
the
ghost
with
a
my
lord
said
i
genially
i
take
it
that
in
the
city
that
sensible
commercial
portion
of
london
no
spirits
are
believed
in
except
those
sold
over
the
bars
you
mean
began
his
lordship
struggling
to
reach
his
dignity
once
more
you
mean
to
ask
if
there
is
any
man
fool
enough
to
place
credit
in
the
story
of
a
ghost
i
answer
no
i
am
a
practical
man
sir
i
now
possess
in
the
north
property
representing
in
farming
lands
in
shooting
rights
and
what
not
a
capital
of
many
a
thousand
pounds
as
you
seem
to
know
everything
sir
perhaps
you
are
aware
that
i
propose
to
build
a
modern
mansion
on
the
estate
i
saw
the
letter
in
the
well
sir
it
has
come
to
a
fine
pass
if
in
this
country
of
law
and
the
rights
of
property
a
man
may
not
do
what
he
pleases
with
his
own
think
my
lord
cases
may
be
cited
where
the
decisions
of
your
courts
have
shown
a
man
may
not
do
what
he
likes
with
his
own
nevertheless
i
am
quite
certain
that
if
you
level
rantremly
castle
with
the
ground
and
build
a
modern
mansion
in
its
place
the
law
will
not
hinder
you
should
hope
not
sir
i
should
hope
not
said
his
lordship
gruffly
i
am
not
one
who
wishes
to
ride
roughshod
over
public
opinion
am
chairman
of
several
companies
which
depend
more
or
less
on
popular
favour
for
success
i
deplore
unnecessary
antagonism
technically
i
might
assert
my
right
to
destroy
this
ancient
stronghold
tomorrow
if
i
wished
to
do
so
and
if
that
right
were
seriously
disputed
i
should
of
course
stand
firm
but
it
is
not
seriously
disputed
the
british
nation
sir
is
too
sensible
a
people
to
object
to
the
removal
of
an
antiquated
structure
that
has
long
outlived
its
usefulness
and
the
erection
of
a
mansion
replete
with
all
modern
improvements
would
be
a
distinct
addition
to
the
country
sir
a
few
impertinent
busybodies
protest
against
the
demolition
of
rantremly
castle
but
that
is
all
then
you
intend
to
destroy
it
i
rejoined
and
it
is
possible
that
a
touch
of
regret
was
manifest
in
my
tones
just
at
present
not
until
this
vulgar
clamour
has
had
time
to
subside
nevertheless
as
a
business
man
i
am
forced
to
recognise
that
a
large
amount
of
unproductive
capital
is
locked
up
in
that
property
why
is
it
locked
up
of
an
absurd
belief
that
the
place
is
haunted
i
could
let
it
tomorrow
at
a
good
figure
if
it
were
not
for
that
rumour
surely
sensible
men
do
not
pay
any
attention
to
such
a
rumour
men
may
not
but
sensible
men
are
often
married
to
silly
women
and
the
women
object
it
is
only
the
other
day
that
i
was
in
negotiation
with
bates
of
bates
sturgeon
and
bates
a
very
wealthy
man
quite
able
and
willing
to
pay
the
price
i
demanded
he
cared
nothing
about
the
alleged
ghost
but
his
family
absolutely
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
place
and
so
the
arrangement
fell
through
is
your
theory
regarding
this
ghost
my
lord
he
answered
me
with
some
impatience
can
a
sane
man
hold
a
theory
about
a
ghost
i
can
however
advance
a
theory
regarding
the
noises
heard
in
the
castle
for
years
that
place
has
been
the
resort
of
questionable
characters
understand
the
rantremly
family
is
a
very
old
one
i
commented
innocently
but
his
lordship
did
not
notice
the
innuendo
we
are
an
old
family
he
went
on
with
great
complacency
castle
as
perhaps
you
are
aware
is
a
huge
ramshackle
place
honeycombed
underneath
with
cellars
i
dare
say
in
the
old
days
some
of
these
cellars
and
caves
were
the
resort
of
smugglers
and
the
receptacle
of
their
contraband
wares
doubtless
with
the
full
knowledge
of
my
ancestors
who
i
regret
to
admit
as
a
business
man
were
not
too
particular
in
their
respect
for
law
i
make
no
doubt
that
the
castle
is
now
the
refuge
of
a
number
of
dangerous
characters
who
knowing
the
legends
of
the
place
frighten
away
fools
by
impersonating
ghosts
wish
me
to
uncover
their
retreat
then
i
get
accommodation
in
the
castle
itself
bless
you
no
nor
within
two
miles
of
it
you
might
secure
bed
and
board
at
the
porter
lodge
perhaps
or
in
the
village
which
is
three
miles
distant
should
prefer
to
live
in
the
castle
night
and
day
until
the
mystery
is
solved
you
are
a
practical
man
that
is
a
very
sensible
resolution
but
you
can
persuade
no
one
in
that
neighbourhood
to
bear
you
company
you
would
need
to
take
some
person
down
with
you
from
london
and
the
chances
are
that
person
will
not
stay
long
my
lord
if
you
used
your
influence
the
chief
of
police
in
the
village
might
allow
a
constable
to
bear
me
company
i
do
not
mind
roughing
it
in
the
least
but
i
should
like
someone
to
prepare
my
meals
and
to
be
on
hand
in
case
of
a
struggle
should
your
surmise
concerning
the
ghost
prove
correct
regret
to
inform
you
said
his
lordship
the
police
in
that
barbarous
district
are
as
superstitious
as
the
peasantry
i
myself
told
the
chief
constable
my
theory
and
for
six
weeks
he
has
been
trying
to
run
down
the
miscreants
who
i
am
sure
are
making
a
rendezvous
of
the
castle
would
you
believe
it
sir
that
the
constabulary
after
a
few
nights
experience
in
the
castle
threatened
to
resign
in
a
body
if
they
were
placed
on
duty
at
rantremly
they
said
they
heard
groans
and
shrieks
and
the
measured
beat
of
a
on
the
oaken
floors
perfectly
absurd
of
course
but
there
you
are
why
i
can
not
even
get
a
charwoman
or
labourer
to
clear
up
the
evidences
of
the
tragedy
which
took
place
there
six
weeks
ago
the
beds
are
untouched
the
broken
china
and
the
silver
tray
lie
today
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
and
everything
remains
just
as
it
was
when
the
inquest
took
place
well
my
lord
the
case
presents
many
difficulties
and
so
speaking
as
one
business
man
to
another
you
will
understand
that
my
compensation
must
be
correspondingly
great
all
the
assumed
dignity
which
straightened
up
this
man
whenever
i
addressed
him
as
lord
instantly
fell
from
him
when
i
enunciated
the
word
his
eyes
narrowed
and
all
the
native
shrewdness
of
an
adept
skinflint
appeared
in
his
face
i
shall
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
drove
the
very
best
bargain
he
could
with
me
and
i
on
my
part
very
deftly
concealed
from
him
the
fact
that
i
was
so
much
interested
in
the
affair
that
i
should
have
gone
down
to
rantremly
for
nothing
rather
than
forgo
the
privilege
of
ransacking
rantremly
castle
when
the
new
earl
had
taken
his
departure
walking
to
the
door
with
the
haughty
air
of
a
nobleman
then
bowing
to
me
with
the
affability
of
a
business
man
i
left
my
flat
took
a
cab
and
speedily
found
myself
climbing
the
stair
to
the
first
floor
of
beaumont
street
strand
as
i
paused
at
the
door
on
which
were
painted
the
words
brooks
stenography
typewriting
translation
i
heard
the
rapid
of
a
machine
inside
knocking
at
the
door
the
writing
ceased
and
i
was
bidden
to
enter
the
room
was
but
meagrely
furnished
and
showed
scant
signs
of
prosperity
on
a
small
clean
but
uncovered
the
breakfast
dishes
washed
but
not
yet
put
away
stood
and
the
kettle
on
the
hob
by
the
dying
fire
led
me
to
infer
that
the
typewriting
woman
was
her
own
cook
i
suspected
that
the
sofa
which
partly
occupied
one
side
of
the
room
concealed
a
bed
by
the
lone
front
window
stood
the
typewriting
machine
on
a
small
stand
and
in
front
of
it
sat
the
woman
who
had
visited
me
the
morning
before
she
was
now
gazing
at
me
probably
hoping
i
was
a
customer
for
there
was
no
recognition
in
her
eyes
lady
rantremly
was
my
greeting
which
caused
her
to
spring
immediately
to
her
feet
with
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
she
said
at
last
are
monsieur
valmont
excuse
me
that
i
am
so
stupid
will
you
take
a
chair
you
madam
it
is
i
who
should
ask
to
be
excused
for
so
unceremonious
a
morning
call
i
have
come
to
ask
you
a
question
can
you
cook
the
lady
looked
at
me
with
some
surprise
mingled
perhaps
with
so
much
of
indignation
as
such
a
mild
person
could
assume
she
did
not
reply
but
glancing
at
the
kettle
and
then
turning
towards
the
breakfast
dishes
on
the
table
by
the
wall
a
slow
flush
of
colour
suffused
her
wan
cheeks
lady
i
said
at
last
as
the
silence
became
embarrassing
must
pardon
the
impulse
of
a
foreigner
who
finds
himself
constantly
brought
into
conflict
with
prejudices
which
he
fails
to
understand
you
are
perhaps
offended
at
my
question
the
last
person
of
whom
i
made
that
inquiry
was
the
young
and
beautiful
madame
la
comtesse
de
who
enthusiastically
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
at
the
compliment
and
replied
impulsively
oh
monsieur
valmont
let
me
compose
for
you
an
omelette
which
will
prove
a
dream
and
she
did
one
should
not
forget
that
louis
xviii
himself
cooked
the
à
la
purée
that
caused
the
duc
who
partook
of
the
royal
dish
to
die
of
an
indigestion
cooking
is
a
noble
yes
a
regal
art
i
am
a
frenchman
my
lady
and
like
all
my
countrymen
regard
the
occupation
of
a
cuisinière
as
infinitely
superior
to
the
manipulation
of
that
machine
which
is
your
profession
or
the
science
of
investigation
which
is
mine
she
said
quite
unmollified
by
my
harangue
speaking
with
a
lofty
pride
which
somehow
seemed
much
more
natural
than
that
so
intermittently
assumed
by
my
recent
visitor
have
you
come
to
offer
me
a
situation
as
cook
madam
at
rantremly
castle
are
going
there
she
demanded
almost
breathlessly
madam
i
leave
on
the
ten
train
tomorrow
morning
i
am
commissioned
by
lord
rantremly
to
investigate
the
supposed
presence
of
the
ghost
in
that
mouldering
dwelling
i
am
allowed
to
bring
with
me
whatever
assistants
i
require
and
am
assured
that
no
one
in
the
neighbourhood
can
be
retained
who
dare
sleep
in
the
castle
you
know
the
place
very
well
having
lived
there
so
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
assistance
if
you
will
come
if
there
is
any
person
whom
you
can
trust
and
who
is
not
afraid
of
ghosts
i
shall
be
delighted
to
escort
you
both
to
rantremly
castle
tomorrow
is
an
old
woman
she
said
comes
here
to
clear
up
my
room
and
do
whatever
i
wish
done
she
is
so
deaf
that
she
will
hear
no
ghosts
and
besides
monsieur
she
can
cook
i
laughed
in
acknowledgment
of
this
last
sly
hit
at
me
as
the
english
say
will
do
excellently
i
replied
rising
and
placing
a
note
before
her
suggest
madam
that
you
purchase
with
this
anything
you
may
need
my
man
has
instructions
to
send
by
passenger
train
a
huge
case
of
provisions
which
should
arrive
there
before
us
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
to
meet
me
at
euston
station
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
train
leaves
we
may
be
able
to
discover
all
you
wish
to
know
regarding
the
mystery
of
rantremly
castle
sophia
brooks
accepted
the
money
without
demur
and
thanked
me
i
could
see
that
her
thin
hands
were
trembling
with
excitement
as
she
put
the
crackling
banknote
into
her
purse
darkness
was
coming
on
next
evening
before
we
were
installed
in
the
grim
building
which
at
first
sight
seemed
more
like
a
fortress
than
a
residence
i
had
telegraphed
from
london
to
order
a
wagonette
for
us
and
in
this
vehicle
we
drove
to
the
police
station
where
i
presented
the
written
order
from
lord
rantremly
for
the
keys
of
the
castle
the
chief
constable
himself
a
stolid
taciturn
person
exhibited
nevertheless
some
interest
in
my
mission
and
he
was
good
enough
to
take
the
fourth
seat
in
the
wagonette
and
accompany
us
through
the
park
to
the
castle
returning
in
that
conveyance
to
the
village
as
nightfall
approached
and
i
could
not
but
notice
that
this
grave
official
betrayed
some
uneasiness
to
get
off
before
dusk
had
completely
set
in
silent
as
he
was
i
soon
learned
that
he
entirely
disbelieved
lord
rantremly
theory
that
the
castle
harboured
dangerous
characters
yet
so
great
was
his
inherent
respect
for
the
nobility
that
i
could
not
induce
him
to
dispute
with
any
decisiveness
his
lordship
conjecture
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
however
that
the
chief
constable
believed
implicitly
in
the
ghost
i
asked
him
to
return
the
next
morning
as
i
should
spend
the
night
in
investigation
and
might
possibly
have
some
questions
to
ask
him
questions
which
none
but
the
chief
constable
could
answer
the
good
man
promised
and
left
us
rather
hurriedly
the
driver
of
the
wagonette
galloping
his
horse
down
the
long
sombre
avenue
towards
the
village
outside
the
gates
i
found
sophia
brooks
but
a
doleful
companion
and
of
very
little
assistance
that
evening
she
seemed
overcome
by
her
remembrances
she
had
visited
the
library
where
her
former
work
was
done
doubtless
the
scene
of
her
brief
love
episode
and
she
returned
with
red
eyes
and
trembling
chin
telling
me
haltingly
that
the
great
tome
from
which
she
was
working
ten
years
ago
and
which
had
been
left
open
on
the
solid
library
table
was
still
there
exactly
as
she
had
placed
it
before
being
forced
to
abandon
her
work
for
a
decade
apparently
no
one
had
entered
that
library
i
could
not
but
sympathise
with
the
poor
lady
thus
revisiting
almost
herself
like
a
ghost
the
haunted
arena
of
her
short
happiness
but
though
she
proved
so
dismal
a
companion
the
old
woman
who
came
with
her
was
a
treasure
having
lived
all
her
life
in
some
near
the
strand
and
having
rarely
experienced
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
country
the
long
journey
had
delighted
her
and
now
this
rambling
old
castle
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
seemed
to
realise
all
the
dreams
which
a
perusal
of
halfpenny
fiction
had
engendered
in
her
imagination
she
lit
a
fire
and
cooked
for
us
a
very
creditable
supper
bustling
about
the
place
singing
to
herself
in
a
high
key
shortly
after
supper
sophia
brooks
exhausted
as
much
by
her
emotions
and
memories
as
by
her
long
journey
of
that
day
retired
to
rest
after
being
left
to
myself
i
smoked
some
cigarettes
and
finished
a
bottle
of
superb
claret
which
stood
at
my
elbow
a
few
hours
before
i
had
undoubtedly
fallen
in
the
estimation
of
the
stolid
constable
when
instead
of
asking
him
questions
regarding
the
tragedy
i
had
inquired
the
position
of
the
wine
cellar
and
obtained
possession
of
the
key
that
opened
its
portal
the
sight
of
bin
after
bin
of
cobwebbed
bottles
did
more
than
anything
else
to
reconcile
me
to
my
lonely
vigil
there
were
some
notable
vintages
represented
in
that
dismal
cavern
it
was
perhaps
ten
or
eleven
when
i
began
my
investigations
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
provide
myself
with
half
a
dozen
electric
torches
before
i
left
london
these
give
illumination
for
twenty
or
thirty
hours
steadily
and
much
longer
if
the
flash
is
used
only
now
and
then
the
torch
is
a
thick
tube
perhaps
a
foot
and
a
half
long
with
a
of
glass
at
one
end
by
pressing
a
spring
the
electric
rays
project
like
the
illumination
of
an
engine
headlight
a
release
of
the
spring
causes
instant
darkness
i
have
found
this
invention
useful
in
that
it
concentrates
the
light
on
any
particular
spot
desired
leaving
all
the
surroundings
in
gloom
so
that
the
mind
is
not
distracted
even
unconsciously
by
the
eye
beholding
more
than
is
necessary
at
the
moment
one
pours
a
white
light
over
any
particular
substance
as
water
is
poured
from
the
nozzle
of
a
hose
the
great
house
was
almost
painfully
silent
i
took
one
of
these
torches
and
went
to
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
where
the
wicked
butler
had
met
his
death
there
as
his
lordship
had
said
lay
the
silver
tray
and
nearby
a
silver
jug
a
pair
of
spoons
a
knife
and
fork
and
scattered
all
around
the
fragments
of
broken
plates
cups
and
saucers
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
at
the
stupidity
of
the
researchers
who
had
preceded
me
i
ran
up
the
stair
two
steps
at
a
time
turned
to
the
right
and
along
the
corridor
until
i
came
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
late
earl
the
coverings
of
the
bed
lay
turned
down
just
as
they
were
when
his
lordship
sprang
to
the
floor
doubtless
in
spite
of
his
deafness
having
heard
faintly
the
fatal
crash
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
great
oaken
chest
stood
at
the
head
of
the
bed
perhaps
six
inches
from
the
wall
leaning
against
this
chest
at
the
edge
of
the
bed
inclined
a
small
round
table
and
the
cover
of
the
table
had
slipped
from
its
sloping
surface
until
it
partly
concealed
the
chest
lid
i
mounted
on
this
carven
box
of
old
black
oak
and
directed
the
rays
of
electric
light
into
the
chasm
between
it
and
the
wall
then
i
laughed
aloud
and
was
somewhat
startled
to
hear
another
laugh
directly
behind
me
i
jumped
down
on
the
floor
again
and
swung
round
my
torch
like
a
searchlight
on
a
battleship
at
sea
there
was
no
human
presence
in
that
chamber
except
myself
of
course
after
my
first
moment
of
surprise
i
realised
that
the
laugh
was
but
an
echo
of
my
own
the
old
walls
of
the
old
house
were
like
the
place
resembled
an
ancient
fiddle
still
tremulous
with
the
music
that
had
been
played
on
it
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
a
superstitious
population
came
to
believe
in
its
being
haunted
in
fact
i
found
by
experiment
that
if
one
trod
quickly
along
the
uncovered
floor
of
the
corridor
and
stopped
suddenly
one
seemed
to
hear
the
sound
of
steps
still
going
on
i
now
returned
to
the
stair
head
and
examined
the
bare
polished
boards
with
most
gratifying
results
amazed
at
having
learnt
so
much
in
such
a
short
time
i
took
from
my
pocket
the
paper
on
which
the
dying
nobleman
had
attempted
to
write
with
his
hand
the
chief
constable
had
given
the
document
to
me
and
i
sat
on
the
stair
head
spread
it
out
on
the
floor
and
scrutinised
it
it
was
all
but
meaningless
apparently
two
words
and
the
initial
letter
of
a
third
had
been
attempted
now
however
grotesque
a
piece
of
writing
may
be
you
can
sometimes
decipher
it
by
holding
it
at
various
angles
as
those
puzzles
are
solved
which
remain
a
mystery
when
gazed
at
direct
by
partially
closing
the
eyes
you
frequently
catch
the
intent
as
in
those
pictures
where
a
human
figure
is
concealed
among
the
outlines
of
trees
and
leaves
i
held
the
paper
at
arm
length
and
with
the
electric
light
gleaming
upon
it
examined
it
at
all
angles
with
eyes
wide
open
and
eyes
half
closed
at
last
inclining
it
away
from
me
i
saw
that
the
words
were
intended
to
mean
secret
the
secret
of
course
was
what
he
was
trying
to
impart
but
he
had
apparently
got
no
further
than
the
title
of
it
deeply
absorbed
in
my
investigation
i
was
never
more
startled
in
my
life
than
to
hear
in
the
stillness
down
the
corridor
the
gasped
words
god
i
swept
round
my
light
and
saw
leaning
against
the
wall
in
an
almost
fainting
condition
sophia
brooks
her
eyes
staring
like
those
of
a
demented
person
and
her
face
white
as
any
ghost
could
have
been
wrapped
round
her
was
a
i
sprang
to
my
feet
are
you
doing
there
i
cried
is
that
you
monsieur
valmont
thank
god
thank
god
i
thought
i
was
going
insane
i
saw
a
hand
a
bodiless
hand
holding
a
white
sheet
of
paper
hand
was
far
from
bodiless
madam
for
it
belonged
to
me
but
why
are
you
here
it
must
be
near
midnight
midnight
answered
the
woman
came
here
because
i
heard
my
husband
call
me
three
times
distinctly
sophia
sophia
sophia
just
like
that
madam
i
said
with
an
asperity
i
seldom
use
where
the
fair
sex
is
concerned
but
i
began
to
see
that
this
hysterical
creature
was
going
to
be
in
the
way
during
a
research
that
called
for
coolness
and
calmness
i
was
sorry
i
had
invited
her
to
come
madam
you
have
been
dreaming
monsieur
valmont
i
have
not
i
have
not
even
been
asleep
and
i
heard
the
words
quite
plainly
you
must
not
think
i
am
either
mad
or
superstitious
i
thought
she
was
both
and
next
moment
she
gave
further
evidence
of
it
running
suddenly
forward
and
clutching
me
by
the
arm
listen
she
whispered
hear
nothing
i
cried
again
almost
roughly
for
my
patience
was
at
an
end
and
i
wished
to
go
on
with
my
inquiry
undisturbed
hist
she
whispered
holding
up
her
finger
we
both
stood
like
statues
and
suddenly
i
felt
that
curious
creeping
of
the
scalp
which
shows
that
even
the
most
civilised
among
us
have
not
yet
eliminated
superstitious
fear
in
the
tense
silence
i
heard
someone
slowly
coming
up
the
stair
i
heard
the
halting
step
of
a
lame
man
in
the
tension
of
the
moment
i
had
allowed
the
light
to
go
out
now
recovering
myself
i
pressed
the
spring
and
waved
its
rays
backward
and
forward
down
the
stairway
the
space
was
entirely
empty
yet
the
hesitating
footsteps
approached
us
up
and
up
i
could
almost
have
sworn
on
which
step
they
last
struck
at
this
interesting
moment
sophia
brooks
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
and
collapsed
into
my
arms
sending
the
electric
torch
rattling
down
the
steps
and
leaving
us
in
impenetrable
darkness
really
i
profess
myself
to
be
a
gallant
man
but
there
are
situations
which
have
a
tendency
to
cause
annoyance
i
carried
the
limp
creature
cautiously
down
the
stairs
fearing
the
fate
of
the
butler
and
at
last
got
her
into
the
where
i
lit
a
candle
which
gave
a
light
less
brilliant
perhaps
but
more
steady
than
my
torch
i
dashed
some
water
in
her
face
and
brought
her
to
her
senses
then
uncorking
another
bottle
of
wine
i
bade
her
drink
a
glassful
which
she
did
was
it
she
whispered
i
do
not
know
very
possibly
the
ghost
of
rantremly
you
believe
in
ghosts
monsieur
valmont
night
i
did
not
but
at
this
hour
i
believe
in
only
one
thing
which
is
that
it
is
time
everyone
was
asleep
she
rose
to
her
feet
at
this
and
with
a
tremulous
little
laugh
apologised
for
her
terror
but
i
assured
her
that
for
the
moment
there
were
two
persons
at
the
stair
head
taking
the
candle
and
recovering
my
electric
torch
which
luckily
was
uninjured
by
its
roll
down
the
incline
the
butler
had
taken
i
escorted
the
lady
to
the
door
of
her
room
and
bade
her
or
rather
the
rising
sun
dissipated
a
slight
veil
of
mist
which
hung
over
the
park
and
also
dissolved
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
phantoms
which
my
imagination
had
conjured
up
at
midnight
it
was
about
ten
when
the
chief
constable
arrived
i
flatter
myself
i
put
some
life
into
that
unimaginative
man
before
i
was
done
with
him
made
you
think
that
the
butler
was
mounting
the
stair
when
he
fell
was
going
up
with
my
lord
breakfast
replied
the
chief
did
it
not
occur
to
you
that
if
such
were
the
case
the
silver
pitcher
would
not
have
been
empty
and
besides
the
broken
dishes
there
would
have
been
the
rolls
butter
toast
or
what
not
strewn
about
the
floor
the
chief
constable
opened
his
eyes
was
no
one
else
for
him
to
bring
breakfast
to
he
objected
is
where
you
are
very
much
mistaken
bring
me
the
boots
the
butler
wore
did
not
wear
boots
sir
he
wore
a
pair
of
cloth
slippers
you
know
where
they
are
they
are
in
the
boot
closet
well
bring
them
out
examine
their
soles
and
sticking
in
one
of
them
you
will
find
a
short
sliver
of
pointed
oak
the
constable
looking
slightly
more
stupefied
than
ever
brought
the
slippers
and
i
heard
him
ejaculate
i
blowed
as
he
approached
me
he
handed
me
the
slippers
soles
upward
and
there
as
i
have
stated
was
the
fragment
of
oak
which
i
pulled
out
if
you
take
this
piece
of
oak
to
the
top
of
the
stair
you
will
see
that
it
fits
exactly
a
slight
interstice
at
the
edge
of
one
of
the
planks
it
is
as
well
to
keep
one
eyes
open
constable
when
investigating
a
case
like
this
i
blowed
he
said
again
as
we
walked
up
the
stair
together
i
showed
him
that
the
sliver
taken
from
the
slipper
fitted
exactly
the
interstice
i
had
indicated
said
i
to
him
butler
was
not
going
up
the
stairs
but
was
coming
down
when
he
fell
headlong
he
must
have
made
a
fearful
clatter
shuffling
along
with
his
burden
his
slipper
was
impaled
by
this
sliver
and
the
butler
hands
being
full
he
could
not
save
himself
but
went
head
foremost
down
the
stair
the
startling
point
however
is
the
fact
that
he
was
carrying
my
lord
breakfast
to
him
or
taking
it
away
from
him
but
that
there
is
someone
else
in
the
castle
for
whom
he
was
caterer
who
is
that
person
blessed
if
i
know
said
the
constable
i
think
you
are
wrong
there
he
may
not
have
been
carrying
up
the
breakfast
but
he
certainly
was
taking
away
the
tray
as
is
shown
by
the
empty
dishes
which
you
have
just
a
moment
ago
pointed
out
constable
when
his
lordship
heard
the
crash
and
sprang
impulsively
from
his
bed
he
upset
the
little
table
on
which
had
been
placed
his
own
tray
it
shot
over
the
oaken
chest
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
if
you
look
between
it
and
the
wall
you
will
find
tray
dishes
and
the
remnants
of
a
breakfast
i
blessed
exclaimed
the
chief
constable
once
again
main
point
of
all
this
i
went
on
calmly
not
the
disaster
to
the
butler
nor
even
the
shock
to
his
lordship
but
the
fact
that
the
tray
the
serving
man
carried
brought
food
to
a
prisoner
who
probably
for
six
weeks
has
been
without
anything
to
eat
said
the
constable
is
a
dead
man
find
it
easier
said
i
believe
in
a
living
man
than
in
a
dead
man
ghost
i
think
i
heard
his
footsteps
at
midnight
and
they
seemed
to
me
the
footsteps
of
a
person
very
nearly
exhausted
therefore
constable
i
have
awaited
your
arrival
with
some
impatience
the
words
his
late
lordship
endeavoured
to
write
on
the
paper
were
the
secret
i
am
sure
that
the
hieroglyphics
with
which
he
ended
his
effort
stood
for
the
letter
r
and
if
he
finished
his
sentence
it
would
have
stood
the
secret
room
now
constable
it
is
a
matter
of
legend
that
a
secret
room
exists
in
this
castle
do
you
know
where
it
is
one
knows
where
the
secret
room
is
or
the
way
to
enter
it
except
the
lords
of
rantremly
i
can
assure
you
that
the
lord
of
rantremly
who
lives
in
london
knows
nothing
about
it
i
have
been
up
and
about
since
daylight
taking
some
rough
measurements
by
stepping
off
distances
i
surmise
that
the
secret
room
is
to
the
left
of
this
stairway
probably
a
whole
suite
of
rooms
exists
for
there
is
certainly
a
stair
coinciding
with
this
one
and
up
that
stair
at
midnight
i
heard
a
man
ascend
either
that
or
the
ghost
that
has
frightened
you
all
and
as
i
have
said
i
believe
in
the
man
here
the
official
made
the
first
sensible
remark
i
had
yet
heard
him
utter
the
walls
are
so
thick
that
a
prisoner
cry
has
not
been
heard
how
could
you
hear
his
footsteps
which
make
much
less
noise
is
very
well
put
constable
and
when
the
same
thing
occurred
to
me
earlier
this
morning
i
began
to
study
the
architecture
of
this
castle
in
the
first
place
the
entrance
hall
is
double
as
wide
at
the
big
doors
as
it
is
near
the
stairway
if
you
stand
with
your
back
to
the
front
door
you
will
at
once
wonder
why
the
builders
made
this
curious
and
unnecessary
right
angle
narrowing
the
farther
part
of
the
hall
to
half
its
width
then
as
you
gaze
at
the
stair
and
see
that
marvellous
carved
oak
newel
post
standing
like
a
monumental
column
you
guess
if
you
have
any
imagination
that
the
stairway
like
the
hall
was
once
double
as
wide
as
it
is
now
we
are
seeing
only
half
of
it
and
doubtless
we
shall
find
a
similar
newel
post
within
the
hidden
room
you
must
remember
constable
that
these
secret
apartments
are
no
small
added
chambers
twice
they
have
sheltered
a
king
the
constable
head
bent
low
at
the
mention
of
royalty
i
saw
that
his
insular
prejudice
against
me
and
my
methods
was
vanishing
and
that
he
had
come
to
look
upon
me
with
greater
respect
than
was
shown
at
first
walls
need
not
be
thick
to
be
impenetrable
to
sound
two
courses
of
brick
and
a
space
between
filled
with
deafening
would
do
it
the
secret
apartment
has
been
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
house
since
the
castle
was
built
and
was
not
designed
by
the
original
architect
the
partition
was
probably
built
in
a
hurry
to
fulfil
a
pressing
need
and
it
was
constructed
straight
up
the
middle
of
the
stair
leaving
the
stout
planks
intact
each
step
passing
thus
as
it
were
through
the
wall
now
when
a
man
walks
up
the
secret
stairway
his
footsteps
reverberate
until
one
would
swear
that
some
unseen
person
was
treading
the
visible
boards
on
the
outside
jove
said
the
constable
in
an
awed
tone
of
voice
officer
i
have
here
a
pickaxe
and
a
crowbar
i
propose
that
we
settle
the
question
at
once
but
to
this
proposal
the
constable
demurred
surely
would
not
break
the
wall
without
permission
from
his
lordship
in
london
i
suspect
there
is
no
lord
rantremly
in
london
and
that
we
will
find
a
very
emaciated
but
genuine
lord
rantremly
within
ten
feet
of
us
i
need
not
tell
you
that
if
you
are
instrumental
in
his
immediate
rescue
without
the
exercise
of
too
much
red
tape
your
interests
will
not
suffer
because
you
the
more
speedily
brought
food
and
drink
to
the
lord
paramount
of
your
district
you
are
cried
the
constable
with
an
enthusiasm
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
shall
we
begin
anywhere
this
wall
is
all
false
from
the
entrance
hall
to
some
point
up
here
still
as
the
butler
was
carrying
the
meal
upstairs
i
think
we
shall
save
time
if
we
begin
on
the
landing
i
found
the
constable
brawn
much
superior
to
his
brain
he
worked
like
a
sansculotte
on
a
barricade
when
we
had
torn
down
part
of
the
old
oak
panelling
which
it
seemed
such
a
pity
to
mutilate
with
axe
and
crowbar
we
came
upon
a
brick
wall
that
quickly
gave
way
before
the
strength
of
the
constable
then
we
pulled
out
some
substance
like
matting
and
found
a
second
brick
wall
beyond
which
was
a
further
shell
of
panelling
the
hole
we
made
revealed
nothing
but
darkness
inside
and
although
we
shouted
there
was
no
answer
at
last
when
we
had
hewn
it
large
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
i
took
with
me
an
electric
torch
and
stepped
inside
the
constable
following
with
crowbar
still
in
hand
i
learned
as
i
had
surmised
that
we
were
in
the
upper
hall
of
a
staircase
nearly
as
wide
as
the
one
on
the
outside
a
flash
of
the
light
showed
a
door
corresponding
with
the
fireplace
of
the
upper
landing
and
this
door
not
being
locked
we
entered
a
large
room
rather
dimly
lighted
by
strongly
barred
windows
that
gave
into
a
blind
courtyard
of
which
there
had
been
no
indication
heretofore
either
outside
or
inside
the
castle
broken
glass
crunched
under
our
feet
and
i
saw
that
the
floor
was
strewn
with
wine
bottles
whose
necks
had
been
snapped
off
to
save
the
pulling
of
the
cork
on
a
mattress
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
lay
a
man
with
gray
hair
and
shaggy
unkempt
beard
he
seemed
either
asleep
or
dead
but
when
i
turned
my
electric
light
full
on
his
face
he
proved
to
be
still
alive
for
he
rubbed
his
eyes
languidly
and
groaned
rather
than
spoke
that
you
at
last
you
beast
of
a
butler
bring
me
something
to
eat
in
heaven
name
i
shook
him
wider
awake
he
seemed
to
be
drowsed
with
drink
and
was
fearfully
emaciated
when
i
got
him
on
his
feet
i
noticed
then
the
deformity
that
characterised
one
of
them
we
assisted
him
through
the
aperture
and
down
into
the
where
he
cried
out
continually
for
something
to
eat
but
when
we
placed
food
before
him
he
could
scarcely
touch
it
he
became
more
like
a
human
being
when
he
had
drunk
two
glasses
of
wine
and
i
saw
at
once
he
was
not
as
old
as
his
gray
hair
seemed
to
indicate
there
was
a
haunted
look
in
his
eyes
and
he
watched
the
door
as
if
apprehensive
is
that
butler
he
asked
at
last
i
replied
i
kill
him
he
fell
down
the
stairway
and
broke
his
neck
the
man
laughed
harshly
is
my
father
is
your
father
rantremly
is
dead
also
came
he
to
die
died
from
a
stroke
of
paralysis
on
the
morning
the
butler
was
killed
the
rescued
man
made
no
comment
on
this
but
turned
and
ate
a
little
more
of
his
food
then
he
said
to
me
you
know
a
girl
named
sophia
brooks
for
ten
years
she
thought
you
dead
years
good
god
do
you
mean
to
say
i
been
in
there
only
ten
years
why
i
an
old
man
i
must
be
sixty
at
least
you
not
much
over
thirty
sophia
he
stopped
and
the
haunted
look
came
into
his
eyes
again
she
is
all
right
and
she
is
here
in
the
grounds
i
sent
her
and
the
servant
out
for
a
walk
and
told
them
not
to
return
till
luncheon
time
as
the
constable
and
i
had
something
to
do
and
did
not
wish
to
be
interrupted
the
man
ran
his
hand
through
his
long
tangled
beard
should
like
to
be
trimmed
up
a
bit
before
i
see
sophia
he
said
can
do
that
for
you
my
lord
cried
the
constable
lord
echoed
the
man
yes
i
understand
you
are
a
policeman
are
you
not
my
lord
chief
constable
i
shall
give
myself
up
to
you
i
killed
the
butler
impossible
my
lord
it
is
the
beast
as
i
called
him
was
getting
old
and
one
morning
he
forgot
to
close
the
door
behind
him
i
followed
him
stealthily
out
and
at
the
head
of
the
stair
planted
my
foot
in
the
small
of
his
back
which
sent
him
headlong
there
was
an
infernal
crash
i
did
not
mean
to
kill
the
brute
but
merely
to
escape
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
run
down
the
stairway
i
was
appalled
to
see
my
father
looking
like
looking
like
well
i
wo
attempt
to
say
what
he
looked
like
but
all
my
old
fear
of
him
returned
as
he
strode
towards
me
along
the
corridor
i
was
in
such
terror
that
i
jumped
through
the
secret
door
and
slammed
it
shut
is
the
secret
door
i
asked
secret
door
is
that
fireplace
the
whole
fireplace
moves
inward
if
you
push
aside
the
carved
ornament
at
the
corner
it
a
dummy
fireplace
then
you
may
build
a
fire
in
it
and
the
smoke
will
escape
up
the
chimney
but
i
killed
the
butler
constable
though
not
intending
it
i
swear
and
now
the
constable
shone
forth
like
the
real
rough
diamond
he
was
lord
we
say
nothing
about
that
legally
you
did
do
it
you
see
there
been
an
inquest
on
the
butler
and
the
jury
brought
in
the
verdict
death
by
accident
through
stumbling
from
the
top
of
the
stair
you
ca
go
behind
a
coroner
inquest
my
lord
said
his
lordship
with
the
first
laugh
in
which
he
had
indulged
for
many
a
year
do
want
to
go
behind
anything
constable
i
been
behind
that
accursed
chimney
too
long
to
wish
any
further
imprisonment
liberation
of
wyoming
a
man
should
present
the
whole
truth
to
his
doctor
his
lawyer
or
his
detective
if
a
doctor
is
to
cure
he
must
be
given
the
full
confidence
of
the
patient
if
a
lawyer
is
to
win
a
case
he
needs
to
know
what
tells
against
his
client
as
well
as
the
points
in
his
favour
if
a
secret
agent
is
to
solve
a
mystery
all
the
cards
should
be
put
on
the
table
those
who
half
trust
a
professional
man
need
not
be
disappointed
when
results
prove
unsatisfactory
a
partial
confidence
reposed
in
me
led
to
the
liberation
of
a
dangerous
criminal
caused
me
to
associate
with
a
robber
much
against
my
own
inclination
and
brought
me
within
danger
of
the
law
of
course
i
never
pretend
to
possess
that
absolute
confidence
in
the
law
which
seems
to
be
the
birthright
of
every
englishman
i
have
lived
too
intimately
among
the
machinery
of
the
law
and
have
seen
too
many
of
its
ghastly
mistakes
to
hold
it
in
that
blind
esteem
which
appears
to
be
prevalent
in
the
british
isles
there
is
a
doggerel
couplet
which
typifies
this
spirit
better
than
anything
i
can
write
and
it
runs
no
rogue
felt
the
halter
draw
with
a
good
opinion
of
the
law
those
lines
exemplify
the
trend
of
british
thought
in
this
direction
if
you
question
a
verdict
of
their
courts
you
are
a
rogue
and
that
ends
the
matter
and
yet
when
an
englishman
undertakes
to
circumvent
the
law
there
is
no
other
man
on
earth
who
will
go
to
greater
lengths
an
amazing
people
never
understandable
by
the
sane
of
other
countries
it
was
entirely
my
own
fault
that
i
became
involved
in
affairs
which
were
almost
indefensible
and
wholly
illegal
my
client
first
tried
to
bribe
me
into
compliance
with
his
wishes
which
bribe
i
sternly
refused
then
he
partially
broke
down
and
quite
unconsciously
as
i
take
it
made
an
appeal
to
the
heart
a
strange
thing
for
an
englishman
to
do
my
kind
heart
has
ever
been
my
most
vulnerable
point
we
french
are
sentimentalists
france
has
before
now
staked
its
very
existence
for
an
ideal
while
other
countries
fight
for
continents
cash
or
commerce
you
can
not
pierce
me
with
a
lance
of
gold
but
wave
a
wand
of
sympathy
and
i
am
yours
there
waited
upon
me
in
my
flat
a
man
who
gave
his
name
as
douglas
sanderson
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
his
legitimate
title
this
was
a
question
into
which
i
never
probed
and
at
the
moment
of
writing
am
as
ignorant
of
his
true
cognomen
if
that
was
not
it
as
on
the
morning
he
first
met
me
he
was
an
elderly
man
of
natural
dignity
and
sobriety
slow
in
speech
almost
sombre
in
dress
his
costume
was
not
quite
that
of
a
professional
man
and
not
quite
that
of
a
gentleman
i
at
once
recognised
the
order
to
which
he
belonged
and
a
most
difficult
class
it
is
to
deal
with
he
was
the
confidential
servant
or
steward
of
some
ancient
and
probably
noble
family
embodying
in
himself
all
the
faults
and
virtues
each
a
trifle
accentuated
of
the
line
he
served
and
to
which
in
order
to
produce
him
and
his
like
his
father
grandfather
and
had
doubtless
been
attached
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
the
honour
of
the
house
he
serves
is
more
dear
to
him
than
it
is
to
the
representative
of
that
house
such
a
man
is
almost
always
the
repository
of
family
secrets
a
repository
whose
inviolability
gold
can
not
affect
threats
sway
or
cajolery
influence
i
knew
when
i
looked
at
him
that
practically
i
was
looking
at
his
master
for
i
have
known
many
cases
where
even
the
personal
appearance
of
the
two
was
almost
identical
which
may
have
given
rise
to
the
english
phrase
master
like
man
the
servant
was
a
little
more
haughty
a
little
less
kind
a
little
more
exclusive
a
little
less
confidential
a
little
more
condescending
a
little
less
human
a
little
more
tory
and
altogether
a
little
less
pleasant
and
easy
person
to
deal
with
he
began
when
i
had
waved
him
to
a
seat
am
a
very
rich
man
and
can
afford
to
pay
well
for
the
commission
i
request
you
to
undertake
to
ask
you
to
name
your
own
terms
may
seem
unbusinesslike
so
i
may
say
at
the
outset
i
am
not
a
business
man
the
service
i
shall
ask
will
involve
the
utmost
secrecy
and
for
that
i
am
willing
to
pay
it
may
expose
you
to
risk
of
limb
or
liberty
and
for
that
i
am
willing
to
pay
it
will
probably
necessitate
the
expenditure
of
a
large
sum
of
money
that
sum
is
at
your
disposal
here
he
paused
he
had
spoken
slowly
and
impressively
with
a
touch
of
arrogance
in
his
tone
which
aroused
to
his
prejudice
the
combativeness
latent
in
my
nature
however
at
this
juncture
i
merely
bowed
my
head
and
replied
in
accents
almost
as
supercilious
as
his
own
task
must
either
be
unworthy
or
unwelcome
in
mentioning
first
the
compensation
you
are
inverting
the
natural
order
of
things
you
should
state
at
the
outset
what
you
expect
me
to
do
then
if
i
accept
the
commission
it
is
time
to
discuss
the
details
of
expenditure
either
he
had
not
looked
for
such
a
reply
or
was
loath
to
open
his
budget
for
he
remained
a
few
moments
with
eyes
bent
upon
the
floor
and
lips
compressed
in
silence
at
last
he
went
on
without
change
of
inflection
without
any
diminution
of
that
air
of
condescension
which
had
so
exasperated
me
in
the
beginning
and
which
was
preparing
a
downfall
for
himself
that
would
rudely
shake
the
cold
dignity
which
encompassed
him
like
a
cloak
is
difficult
for
a
father
to
confide
in
a
complete
stranger
the
vagaries
of
a
beloved
son
and
before
doing
so
you
must
pledge
your
word
that
my
communication
will
be
regarded
as
strictly
confidential
va
sans
do
not
understand
french
said
sanderson
severely
as
if
the
use
of
the
phrase
were
an
insult
to
him
i
replied
nonchalantly
means
as
a
matter
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
whatever
you
care
to
tell
me
about
your
son
will
be
mentioned
to
no
one
pray
proceed
without
further
circumlocution
for
my
time
is
valuable
son
was
always
a
little
wild
and
impatient
of
control
although
everything
he
could
wish
was
at
his
disposal
here
at
home
he
chose
to
visit
america
where
he
fell
into
bad
company
i
assure
you
there
is
no
real
harm
in
the
boy
but
he
became
implicated
with
others
and
has
suffered
severely
for
his
recklessness
for
five
years
he
has
been
an
inmate
of
a
prison
in
the
west
he
was
known
and
convicted
under
the
name
of
wyoming
ed
was
his
crime
alleged
crime
was
the
stopping
and
robbing
of
a
railway
train
how
long
was
he
sentenced
was
sentenced
for
life
do
you
wish
me
to
do
appeal
has
been
made
to
the
governor
of
the
state
in
an
endeavour
to
obtain
a
pardon
these
appeals
have
failed
i
am
informed
that
if
money
enough
is
expended
it
may
be
possible
to
arrange
my
son
escape
other
words
you
wish
me
to
bribe
the
officials
of
the
jail
assure
you
the
lad
is
innocent
for
the
first
time
a
quiver
of
human
emotion
came
into
the
old
voice
if
you
can
prove
that
why
not
apply
for
a
new
trial
the
circumstances
of
the
case
of
his
arrest
on
the
train
itself
the
number
of
witnesses
against
him
give
me
no
hope
that
a
new
trial
would
end
in
a
different
verdict
even
if
a
new
trial
could
be
obtained
which
i
am
informed
is
not
possible
every
legal
means
tending
to
his
liberation
has
already
been
tried
see
and
now
you
are
determined
to
adopt
illegal
means
i
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
malpractice
you
propose
you
objected
to
a
phrase
in
french
sanderson
perhaps
one
in
latin
will
please
you
better
it
is
which
means
truth
will
prevail
i
shall
set
your
mind
entirely
at
rest
regarding
your
son
your
son
at
this
moment
occupies
a
humble
if
honourable
position
in
the
great
house
from
which
you
came
and
he
hopes
in
time
worthily
to
fill
his
father
shoes
as
you
have
filled
the
shoes
of
your
father
you
are
not
a
rich
man
but
a
servant
your
son
never
was
in
america
and
never
will
go
there
it
is
your
master
son
the
heir
to
great
english
estates
who
became
the
wyoming
ed
of
the
western
prison
even
from
what
you
say
i
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
he
was
justly
convicted
and
you
may
go
back
to
your
master
and
tell
him
so
you
came
here
to
conceal
the
shameful
secret
of
a
wealthy
and
noble
house
you
may
return
knowing
that
secret
has
been
revealed
and
that
the
circumstances
in
which
you
so
solemnly
bound
me
to
secrecy
never
existed
sir
that
is
the
penalty
of
lying
the
old
man
contempt
for
me
had
been
something
to
be
felt
so
palpable
was
it
the
armour
of
icy
reserve
had
been
so
complete
that
actually
i
had
expected
to
see
him
rise
with
undiminished
hauteur
and
leave
the
room
disdaining
further
parley
with
one
who
had
insulted
him
doubtless
that
is
the
way
in
which
his
master
would
have
acted
but
even
in
the
underling
i
was
unprepared
for
the
instantaneous
crumbling
of
this
monument
of
pomp
and
pride
a
few
moments
after
i
began
to
speak
in
terms
as
severe
as
his
own
his
trembling
hands
grasped
the
arms
of
the
chair
in
which
he
sat
and
his
eyes
which
came
to
regard
me
with
something
like
superstitious
dread
as
i
went
on
showed
me
i
had
launched
my
random
arrow
straight
at
the
of
fact
his
face
grew
mottled
and
green
rather
than
pale
when
at
last
i
accused
him
of
lying
he
arose
slowly
shaking
like
a
man
with
a
palsy
but
unable
to
support
himself
erect
sank
helplessly
back
into
his
chair
again
his
head
fell
forward
to
the
table
before
him
and
he
sobbed
aloud
help
me
he
cried
is
not
my
own
secret
i
am
trying
to
guard
i
sprang
to
the
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
so
that
by
no
chance
might
we
be
interrupted
then
going
to
the
sideboard
i
poured
him
out
a
liqueur
glass
full
of
the
finest
cognac
ever
imported
from
south
of
the
loire
and
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
said
brusquely
drink
this
the
case
is
no
worse
than
it
was
half
an
hour
ago
i
shall
not
betray
the
secret
he
tossed
off
the
brandy
and
with
some
effort
regained
his
have
done
my
errand
badly
he
wailed
do
know
what
i
have
said
that
has
led
you
to
so
accurate
a
statement
of
the
real
situation
but
i
have
been
a
blundering
fool
god
forgive
me
when
so
much
depended
on
my
making
no
mistake
let
that
trouble
you
i
replied
you
said
gave
me
the
slightest
clue
called
me
a
liar
he
continued
that
is
a
hard
word
from
one
man
to
another
but
i
would
not
lie
for
myself
and
when
i
do
it
for
one
i
revere
and
respect
my
only
regret
is
that
i
have
done
it
without
avail
dear
sir
i
assured
him
fault
is
not
with
yourself
at
all
you
were
simply
attempting
the
impossible
stripped
and
bare
your
proposal
amounts
to
this
i
am
to
betake
myself
to
the
united
states
and
there
commit
a
crime
or
a
series
of
crimes
in
bribing
sworn
officials
to
turn
traitor
to
their
duty
and
permit
a
convict
to
escape
put
it
very
harshly
sir
you
must
admit
that
especially
in
new
countries
there
is
lawlessness
within
the
law
as
well
as
outside
of
it
the
real
criminals
in
the
robbery
of
the
railway
train
escaped
my
young
master
poor
fellow
was
caught
his
father
one
of
the
proudest
men
in
england
has
grown
prematurely
old
under
the
burden
of
this
terrible
dishonour
he
is
and
a
dying
man
yet
he
presents
an
impassive
front
to
the
world
with
all
the
ancient
courage
of
his
race
my
young
master
is
an
only
son
and
failing
his
appearance
should
his
father
die
title
and
estate
will
pass
to
strangers
our
helplessness
in
this
situation
adds
to
its
horror
we
dare
not
make
any
public
move
my
old
master
is
one
with
such
influence
among
the
governing
class
of
this
country
of
which
he
has
long
been
a
member
that
the
average
englishman
if
his
name
were
mentioned
would
think
his
power
limitless
yet
that
power
he
dare
not
exert
to
save
his
own
son
from
a
felon
life
and
death
however
much
he
or
another
may
suffer
publicity
must
be
avoided
and
this
is
a
secret
which
can
not
safely
be
shared
with
more
than
those
who
know
it
now
many
know
it
this
country
three
persons
in
an
american
prison
one
you
kept
up
communication
with
the
young
man
yes
through
a
third
person
my
young
master
has
implored
his
father
not
to
write
to
him
direct
as
we
may
call
him
is
the
third
person
in
the
secret
who
is
he
i
dare
not
tell
you
sanderson
it
would
be
much
better
for
your
master
and
his
son
that
you
should
be
more
open
with
me
these
are
misleading
has
the
son
made
any
suggestion
regarding
his
release
yes
but
not
the
suggestion
i
have
put
before
you
his
latest
letter
was
to
the
effect
that
within
six
months
or
so
there
is
to
be
an
election
for
governor
he
proposes
that
a
large
sum
of
money
shall
be
used
to
influence
this
election
so
that
a
man
pledged
to
pardon
him
may
sit
in
the
governor
chair
see
and
this
sum
of
money
is
to
be
paid
to
the
third
person
you
referred
to
i
take
it
that
this
third
person
is
the
one
to
whom
various
sums
have
been
paid
during
the
last
five
years
in
order
to
bribe
the
governor
to
pardon
the
young
man
sanderson
hesitated
a
moment
before
answering
in
fact
he
appeared
so
torn
between
inclination
and
duty
anxious
to
give
me
whatever
information
i
deemed
necessary
yet
hemmed
in
by
the
instructions
with
which
his
master
had
limited
him
that
at
last
i
waved
my
hand
and
said
need
not
reply
sanderson
that
third
party
is
the
crux
of
the
situation
i
strongly
suspect
him
of
blackmail
if
you
would
but
name
him
and
allow
me
to
lure
him
to
these
rooms
i
possess
a
little
private
prison
of
my
own
into
which
i
could
thrust
him
and
i
venture
to
say
that
before
he
had
passed
a
week
in
darkness
on
bread
and
water
we
should
have
the
truth
about
this
business
look
you
now
the
illogical
nature
of
an
englishman
poor
old
sanderson
who
had
come
to
me
with
a
proposal
to
break
the
law
of
america
seemed
when
i
airily
suggested
the
immuring
of
a
man
in
a
dungeon
here
in
england
he
gazed
at
me
in
amazement
then
cast
his
eyes
furtively
about
him
as
if
afraid
a
trap
door
would
drop
beneath
him
and
land
him
in
my
private
not
be
alarmed
sanderson
you
are
perfectly
safe
you
are
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
of
this
business
and
it
seems
to
me
five
years
of
contributions
to
this
third
party
without
any
result
might
have
opened
the
eyes
of
even
the
most
influential
nobleman
in
england
not
to
mention
those
of
his
faithful
servant
sir
said
sanderson
must
confess
to
you
that
i
have
long
had
a
suspicion
of
this
third
person
but
my
master
has
clung
to
him
as
his
only
hope
and
if
this
third
person
were
interfered
with
i
may
tell
you
that
he
has
deposited
in
london
at
some
place
unknown
to
us
a
full
history
of
the
case
and
if
it
should
happen
that
he
disappears
for
more
than
a
week
at
a
time
this
record
will
be
brought
to
light
dear
sanderson
that
device
is
as
old
as
noah
and
his
ark
i
should
chance
that
let
me
lay
this
fellow
by
the
heels
and
i
will
guarantee
that
no
publicity
follows
sanderson
sadly
shook
his
head
might
happen
as
you
say
sir
but
all
that
would
put
us
no
further
forward
the
only
point
is
the
liberation
of
my
young
master
it
is
possible
that
the
person
unmentioned
whom
we
may
call
number
three
has
been
cheating
us
throughout
but
that
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
me
but
i
think
it
is
suppose
your
young
master
here
and
at
liberty
this
number
three
would
continue
to
maintain
the
power
over
him
which
he
seems
to
have
held
over
his
father
for
the
last
five
years
think
we
can
prevent
that
sir
if
my
plan
is
carried
out
scheme
for
bribing
the
american
officials
is
yours
then
sir
and
i
may
say
i
am
taking
a
great
deal
upon
myself
in
coming
to
you
i
am
in
fact
disobeying
the
implied
commands
of
my
master
but
i
have
seen
him
pay
money
and
very
large
sums
of
money
to
this
number
three
for
the
last
five
years
and
nothing
has
come
of
it
my
master
is
an
unsuspicious
man
who
has
seen
little
of
the
real
world
and
thinks
everyone
as
honest
as
himself
that
may
be
sanderson
but
permit
me
to
suggest
that
the
one
who
proposes
a
scheme
of
bribery
and
to
put
it
mildly
an
evasion
of
the
law
shows
some
knowledge
of
the
lower
levels
of
this
world
and
is
not
quite
in
a
position
to
plume
himself
on
his
own
honesty
am
coming
to
that
valmont
my
master
knows
nothing
whatever
of
my
plan
he
has
given
me
the
huge
sum
of
money
demanded
by
number
three
and
he
supposes
that
amount
has
been
already
paid
over
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
not
been
paid
over
and
will
not
be
until
my
suggestion
has
been
carried
out
and
failed
in
fact
i
am
about
to
use
this
money
all
of
it
if
necessary
if
you
will
undertake
the
commission
i
have
paid
number
three
his
usual
monthly
allowance
and
will
continue
to
do
so
i
have
told
him
my
master
has
his
proposal
under
consideration
that
there
are
still
six
months
to
come
and
go
upon
and
that
my
master
is
not
one
who
decides
in
a
hurry
three
says
there
is
an
election
in
six
months
for
governor
what
is
the
name
of
the
state
sanderson
informed
me
i
walked
to
my
and
took
down
a
current
american
year
book
consulted
it
and
returned
to
the
table
is
no
election
in
that
state
sanderson
for
eighteen
months
number
three
is
simply
a
blackmailer
as
i
have
suspected
so
sir
replied
sanderson
taking
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
read
in
this
paper
an
account
of
a
man
immured
in
a
spanish
dungeon
his
friends
arranged
it
with
the
officials
in
this
way
the
prisoner
was
certified
to
have
died
and
his
body
was
turned
over
to
his
relatives
now
if
that
could
be
done
in
america
it
would
serve
two
purposes
it
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
get
my
young
master
out
of
the
jail
it
would
remain
a
matter
of
record
that
he
had
died
therefore
there
could
be
no
search
for
him
as
would
be
the
case
if
he
simply
escaped
if
you
were
so
good
as
to
undertake
this
task
you
might
perhaps
see
my
young
master
in
his
cell
and
ask
him
to
write
to
this
number
three
with
whom
he
is
in
constant
communication
telling
him
he
was
very
then
you
could
arrange
with
the
prison
doctor
that
this
person
was
informed
of
my
young
master
death
well
we
can
try
that
but
a
blackmailer
is
not
so
easily
thrown
off
the
scent
once
he
has
tasted
blood
he
is
a
human
tiger
but
still
there
is
always
my
private
dungeon
in
the
background
and
if
your
plan
for
silencing
him
fails
i
guarantee
that
my
more
drastic
and
equally
illegal
method
will
be
a
success
it
will
be
seen
that
my
scruples
concerning
the
acceptance
of
this
commission
and
my
first
dislike
for
the
old
man
had
both
faded
away
during
the
conversation
which
i
have
set
down
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
saw
him
under
the
stress
of
deep
emotion
and
latterly
began
to
realise
the
tremendous
chances
he
was
taking
in
contravening
the
will
of
his
imperious
master
if
the
large
sum
of
money
was
long
withheld
from
the
blackmailer
douglas
sanderson
ran
the
risk
of
number
three
opening
up
communication
direct
with
his
master
investigation
would
show
that
the
old
servant
had
come
perilously
near
laying
himself
open
to
a
charge
of
breach
of
trust
and
even
of
defalcation
with
regard
to
the
money
and
all
this
danger
he
was
heroically
incurring
for
the
unselfish
purpose
of
serving
the
interests
of
his
employer
during
our
long
interview
old
sanderson
gradually
became
a
hero
in
my
eyes
and
entirely
in
opposition
to
the
resolution
i
had
made
at
the
beginning
i
accepted
his
commission
at
the
end
of
it
nevertheless
my
american
experiences
are
those
of
which
i
am
least
proud
and
all
i
care
to
say
upon
the
subject
is
that
my
expedition
proved
completely
successful
the
late
convict
was
my
companion
on
the
the
first
steamship
sailing
for
england
after
we
reached
new
york
from
the
west
of
course
i
knew
that
two
or
three
years
roughing
it
in
mining
camps
and
on
ranches
followed
by
five
years
in
prison
must
have
produced
a
radical
effect
not
only
on
the
character
but
also
in
the
personal
appearance
of
a
man
who
had
undergone
these
privations
nevertheless
making
due
allowance
for
all
this
i
could
not
but
fear
that
the
ancient
english
family
of
which
this
young
man
was
the
hope
and
pride
would
be
exceedingly
disappointed
with
him
in
spite
of
the
change
which
grooming
and
the
wearing
of
a
civilised
costume
made
wyoming
ed
still
looked
much
more
the
criminal
than
the
gentleman
i
considered
myself
in
honour
bound
not
to
make
any
inquiries
of
the
young
man
regarding
his
parentage
of
course
if
i
had
wished
to
possess
myself
of
the
secret
i
had
but
to
touch
a
button
under
the
table
when
sanderson
left
my
rooms
in
the
imperial
flats
which
would
have
caused
him
to
be
shadowed
and
run
to
earth
i
may
also
add
that
the
volunteered
no
particulars
about
himself
or
his
family
only
once
on
board
ship
did
he
attempt
to
obtain
some
information
from
me
as
we
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
together
are
acting
for
someone
else
i
suppose
he
said
someone
in
england
put
up
the
money
did
he
there
was
a
pause
during
which
we
took
two
or
three
turns
in
silence
course
there
no
secret
about
it
he
said
at
last
expected
help
from
the
other
side
but
colonel
jim
has
been
so
mighty
long
about
it
i
was
afraid
he
forgotten
me
is
colonel
jim
jim
baxter
was
it
him
gave
you
the
money
never
heard
of
the
man
before
who
put
up
the
coin
sanderson
i
replied
looking
at
him
sidewise
as
i
mentioned
the
name
it
had
apparently
no
effect
upon
him
he
wrinkled
his
brow
for
a
moment
then
said
if
you
never
heard
of
baxter
i
never
heard
of
sanderson
this
led
me
to
suspect
that
douglas
sanderson
did
not
give
me
his
own
name
and
doubtless
the
address
with
which
he
had
furnished
me
was
merely
temporary
i
did
not
cable
to
him
from
america
regarding
the
success
of
the
expedition
because
i
could
not
be
certain
it
was
a
success
until
i
was
safely
on
english
ground
and
not
even
then
to
tell
the
truth
anyhow
i
wished
to
leave
no
trail
behind
me
but
the
moment
the
reached
liverpool
i
telegraphed
sanderson
to
meet
us
that
evening
at
my
flat
he
was
waiting
for
me
when
wyoming
ed
and
i
entered
together
the
old
man
was
quite
evidently
in
a
state
of
nervous
tension
he
had
been
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
hands
clenched
behind
his
back
and
now
stood
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
door
as
he
heard
us
approach
with
his
hands
still
clasped
behind
his
back
and
an
expression
of
deep
anxiety
upon
his
rugged
face
all
the
electric
lamps
were
turned
on
and
the
room
was
bright
as
day
you
not
brought
him
with
you
he
cried
him
with
me
i
echoed
is
wyoming
ed
the
old
man
glared
at
him
for
a
moment
or
two
stupefied
then
moaned
my
god
my
god
that
is
not
the
man
i
turned
to
my
fellow
traveller
told
me
you
were
wyoming
ed
he
laughed
uneasily
in
a
manner
of
speaking
so
i
have
been
for
the
last
five
years
but
i
was
wyoming
ed
before
that
say
old
man
are
you
acting
for
colonel
jim
baxter
sanderson
on
whom
a
dozen
years
seemed
to
have
fallen
since
we
entered
the
room
appeared
unable
to
speak
and
merely
shook
his
head
in
a
hopeless
sort
of
way
say
boys
ejaculated
the
with
an
uneasy
laugh
is
a
sort
of
is
it
i
wish
colonel
jim
was
here
to
explain
i
say
boss
he
cried
suddenly
turning
sharp
on
me
here
misfit
not
my
fault
i
did
change
the
children
in
the
cradle
you
do
intend
to
send
me
back
to
that
do
you
i
said
if
you
tell
the
truth
sit
down
the
late
prisoner
seated
himself
in
a
chair
as
close
to
the
door
as
possible
hitching
a
little
nearer
as
he
sat
down
his
face
had
taken
on
a
sharp
crafty
aspect
like
that
of
a
trapped
rat
are
perfectly
safe
i
assured
him
over
here
by
the
table
even
if
you
bolted
through
that
door
you
could
get
out
of
this
flat
sanderson
take
a
chair
the
old
man
sank
despondently
into
the
one
nearest
at
hand
i
pressed
a
button
and
when
my
servant
entered
i
said
to
him
some
cognac
and
scotch
whisky
glasses
and
two
syphons
of
soda
have
got
any
kentucky
or
canadian
asked
the
prisoner
moistening
his
lips
the
jail
whiteness
in
his
face
was
now
accentuated
by
the
pallor
of
fear
and
the
haunted
look
of
the
escaped
convict
glimmered
from
his
eyes
in
spite
of
the
comfort
i
had
attempted
to
bestow
upon
him
he
knew
that
he
had
been
rescued
in
mistake
for
another
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
left
prison
realised
he
was
among
strangers
and
not
among
friends
in
his
trouble
he
turned
to
the
beverage
of
his
native
continent
a
bottle
of
canadian
whisky
i
said
to
the
servant
who
disappeared
and
shortly
returned
with
what
i
had
ordered
i
locked
the
door
after
him
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
am
i
to
call
you
i
asked
the
with
a
forced
laugh
he
said
can
call
me
jack
for
short
well
jack
help
yourself
and
he
poured
out
a
very
liberal
glass
of
the
dominion
liquor
refusing
to
dilute
it
with
soda
sanderson
took
scotch
and
i
helped
myself
to
a
of
brandy
jack
i
began
may
tell
you
plainly
that
if
i
wished
to
send
you
back
to
prison
i
could
not
do
so
without
incriminating
myself
you
are
legally
dead
and
you
have
now
a
chance
to
begin
life
anew
an
opportunity
of
which
i
hope
you
will
take
advantage
if
you
were
to
apply
three
weeks
from
today
at
the
prison
doors
they
would
not
dare
admit
you
you
are
dead
does
that
console
you
squire
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
i
never
thought
i
be
pleased
to
hear
i
was
dead
but
i
glad
if
it
all
fixed
as
you
say
and
you
can
bet
your
last
pair
of
boots
i
going
to
keep
out
of
the
jug
in
future
if
i
can
right
now
i
can
promise
that
if
you
answer
all
my
questions
truthfully
you
shall
be
given
money
enough
to
afford
you
a
new
beginning
in
life
enough
said
jack
briefly
were
known
in
prison
as
wyoming
ed
sir
that
was
not
your
name
why
did
you
use
it
colonel
jim
on
the
train
asked
me
to
do
that
he
said
it
would
give
him
a
pull
in
england
to
get
me
free
you
know
wyoming
ed
sir
he
was
one
of
us
three
that
held
up
the
train
became
of
him
was
shot
dead
one
of
the
passengers
there
was
silence
during
which
the
old
man
groaned
and
bowed
his
head
jack
was
studying
the
floor
then
he
looked
up
at
me
and
said
do
expect
me
to
give
a
pal
away
do
you
that
pal
has
given
you
away
for
the
last
five
years
it
seems
to
me
you
need
not
show
very
much
consideration
for
him
not
so
sure
he
did
am
but
never
mind
that
point
colonel
jim
baxter
shot
wyoming
ed
and
killed
him
why
here
my
friend
you
going
a
little
too
fast
i
did
say
that
he
reached
somewhat
defiantly
for
the
bottle
from
canada
me
i
said
rising
quietly
and
taking
possession
of
the
bottle
myself
grieves
me
more
than
i
can
say
to
restrict
my
hospitality
i
have
never
done
such
a
thing
in
my
life
before
but
this
is
not
a
drinking
bout
it
is
a
very
serious
conference
the
whisky
you
have
already
taken
has
given
you
a
bogus
courage
and
a
false
view
of
things
are
you
going
to
tell
me
the
truth
or
are
you
not
jack
pondered
on
this
for
a
while
then
he
said
sir
i
perfectly
willing
to
tell
you
the
truth
as
far
as
it
concerns
myself
but
i
do
want
to
rat
on
a
friend
i
have
said
he
is
your
friend
he
told
you
to
take
the
name
of
wyoming
ed
so
that
he
might
blackmail
the
father
of
wyoming
ed
he
has
done
so
for
the
last
five
years
living
in
luxury
here
in
london
and
not
moving
a
finger
to
help
you
in
fact
nothing
would
appal
him
more
than
to
learn
that
you
are
now
in
this
country
by
this
time
he
has
probably
received
the
news
from
the
prison
doctor
that
you
are
dead
and
so
thinks
himself
safe
for
ever
you
can
prove
that
to
me
said
jack
can
and
will
i
interrupted
then
turning
to
sanderson
i
demanded
are
you
to
meet
this
man
next
at
nine
he
answered
monthly
payment
is
due
and
he
is
clamouring
for
the
large
sum
i
told
you
of
do
you
meet
him
in
london
your
master
town
house
you
take
us
there
and
place
us
where
we
can
see
him
and
he
ca
see
us
i
trust
to
your
honour
valmont
a
closed
carriage
will
call
for
me
at
eight
and
you
can
accompany
me
still
after
all
mr
valmont
we
have
no
assurance
that
he
is
the
same
person
this
young
man
refers
to
am
certain
he
is
he
does
not
go
under
the
name
of
colonel
jim
baxter
i
suppose
the
convict
had
been
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
during
this
colloquy
suddenly
he
drew
his
chair
up
closer
to
the
table
here
he
said
fellows
are
square
i
can
see
that
and
after
all
said
and
done
you
the
man
that
got
me
out
of
clink
now
i
half
suspicion
you
right
about
colonel
jim
but
anyhow
i
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
colonel
jim
was
a
britisher
and
i
suppose
that
why
he
and
wyoming
ed
chummed
together
a
good
deal
we
called
jim
baxter
colonel
but
he
never
said
he
was
a
colonel
or
anything
else
i
was
told
he
belonged
to
the
british
army
and
that
something
happened
in
india
so
that
he
had
to
light
out
he
never
talked
about
himself
but
he
was
a
mighty
taking
fellow
when
he
laid
out
to
please
anybody
we
called
him
colonel
because
he
was
so
straight
in
the
back
and
walked
as
if
he
were
on
parade
when
this
young
english
tenderfoot
came
out
he
and
the
colonel
got
to
be
as
thick
as
thieves
and
the
colonel
won
a
good
deal
of
money
from
him
at
cards
but
that
did
make
any
difference
in
their
friendship
the
colonel
most
always
won
when
he
played
cards
and
perhaps
that
what
started
the
talk
about
why
he
left
the
british
army
he
was
the
luckiest
beggar
i
ever
knew
in
that
line
of
business
we
all
met
in
the
rush
to
the
new
goldfields
which
did
pan
out
worth
a
cent
and
one
after
another
of
the
fellows
quit
and
went
somewhere
else
but
wyoming
ed
he
held
on
even
after
colonel
jim
wanted
to
quit
as
long
as
there
were
plenty
of
fellows
there
colonel
jim
never
lacked
money
although
he
did
dig
it
out
of
the
ground
but
when
the
population
thinned
down
to
only
a
few
of
us
then
we
all
struck
hard
times
now
i
knew
colonel
jim
was
going
to
hold
up
a
train
he
asked
me
if
i
would
join
him
and
i
said
i
would
if
there
was
too
many
in
the
gang
i
been
into
that
business
afore
and
i
knew
there
was
no
greater
danger
than
to
have
a
whole
mob
of
fellows
three
men
can
hold
up
a
train
better
than
three
dozen
everybody
scared
except
the
express
messenger
and
it
generally
easy
to
settle
him
for
he
stands
where
the
light
is
and
we
shoot
from
the
dark
well
i
thought
at
first
wyoming
ed
was
on
to
the
scheme
because
when
we
were
waiting
in
the
cut
to
signal
the
train
he
talked
about
us
going
on
with
her
to
san
francisco
but
i
thought
he
was
only
joking
i
guess
that
colonel
jim
imagined
that
when
it
came
to
the
pinch
ed
back
out
and
leave
us
in
the
lurch
he
knew
ed
was
as
brave
as
a
lion
in
the
cut
where
the
train
would
be
on
the
up
grade
the
colonel
got
his
lantern
ready
lit
it
and
wrapped
a
thin
red
silk
handkerchief
round
it
the
express
was
timed
to
pass
up
there
about
midnight
but
it
was
near
one
when
her
headlight
came
in
sight
we
knew
all
the
passengers
would
be
in
bed
in
the
sleepers
and
asleep
in
the
smoking
car
and
the
day
coach
we
did
intend
to
meddle
with
them
the
colonel
had
brought
a
stick
or
two
of
dynamite
from
the
mines
and
was
going
to
blow
open
the
safe
in
the
express
car
and
climb
out
with
whatever
was
inside
train
stopped
to
the
signal
all
right
and
the
colonel
fired
a
couple
of
shots
just
to
let
the
engineer
know
we
meant
business
the
engineer
and
fireman
at
once
threw
up
their
hands
then
the
colonel
turns
to
ed
who
was
standing
there
like
a
man
and
says
to
him
mighty
sharp
just
like
if
he
was
speaking
to
a
regiment
of
soldiers
you
keep
these
two
men
covered
come
on
jack
he
says
to
me
and
then
we
steps
up
to
the
door
of
the
express
car
which
the
fellow
inside
had
got
locked
and
bolted
the
colonel
fires
his
revolver
in
through
the
lock
then
flung
his
shoulder
agin
the
door
and
it
went
in
with
a
crash
which
was
followed
instantly
by
another
crash
for
the
little
expressman
was
game
right
through
he
had
put
out
the
lights
and
was
blazing
away
at
the
open
door
the
colonel
sprang
for
cover
inside
the
car
and
was
touched
but
one
of
the
shots
took
me
just
above
the
knee
and
broke
my
leg
so
i
went
down
in
a
heap
the
minute
the
colonel
counted
seven
shots
he
was
on
to
that
express
messenger
like
a
tiger
and
had
him
tied
up
in
a
hard
knot
before
you
could
shake
a
stick
then
quick
as
a
wink
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp
plucky
as
the
express
messenger
was
he
looked
scared
to
death
and
now
when
colonel
jim
held
a
pistol
to
his
head
he
gave
up
the
keys
and
told
him
how
to
open
the
safe
i
had
fallen
back
against
the
corner
of
the
car
inside
and
was
groaning
with
pain
colonel
jim
was
scooping
out
the
money
from
the
shelves
of
the
safe
and
stuffing
it
into
a
sack
are
you
hurt
jack
he
cried
yes
my
leg
broke
do
let
that
trouble
you
we
get
you
clear
all
right
do
you
think
you
can
ride
your
horse
i
do
believe
it
said
i
i
guess
i
done
for
and
i
thought
i
was
jim
never
looked
round
but
he
went
through
that
safe
in
a
way
that
make
your
hair
curl
throwing
aside
the
bulky
packages
after
tearing
them
open
taking
only
cash
which
he
thrust
into
a
bag
he
had
with
him
till
he
was
loaded
like
a
millionaire
then
suddenly
he
swore
for
the
train
began
to
move
what
is
that
fool
ed
doing
he
shouted
rising
to
his
feet
that
minute
ed
came
in
pistol
in
each
hand
and
his
face
ablaze
here
you
cursed
thief
he
cried
i
did
come
with
you
to
rob
a
train
get
outside
you
fool
roared
colonel
jim
get
outside
and
stop
this
train
jack
has
got
his
leg
broke
do
come
another
step
towards
me
or
i
kill
you
ed
he
walked
right
on
colonel
jim
backing
then
there
was
a
shot
that
rang
like
cannon
fire
in
the
closed
car
and
ed
fell
forward
on
his
face
colonel
jim
turned
him
over
and
i
saw
he
had
been
hit
square
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
the
train
was
now
going
at
good
speed
and
we
were
already
miles
away
from
where
our
horses
were
tied
i
never
heard
a
man
swear
like
colonel
jim
he
went
through
the
pockets
of
ed
and
took
a
bundle
of
papers
that
was
inside
his
coat
and
this
he
stuffed
away
in
his
own
clothes
then
he
turned
to
me
and
his
voice
was
like
a
lamb
jack
old
man
he
said
i
ca
help
you
they
going
to
nab
you
but
not
for
murder
the
expressman
there
will
be
your
witness
it
is
murder
anyhow
on
my
part
but
you
saw
he
was
coming
at
me
when
i
warned
him
to
keep
away
this
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
for
the
expressman
to
hear
then
he
bent
over
to
me
and
whispered
i
get
the
best
lawyer
i
can
for
you
but
i
afraid
they
bound
to
convict
you
and
if
they
do
i
will
spend
every
penny
of
this
money
to
get
you
free
you
call
yourself
wyoming
ed
at
the
trial
i
taken
all
this
man
papers
so
that
he
ca
be
identified
and
do
you
worry
if
you
sentenced
for
remember
i
be
working
night
and
day
for
you
and
if
money
can
get
you
out
you
be
got
out
because
these
papers
will
help
me
to
get
the
cash
required
ed
folks
are
rich
in
england
so
they
fork
over
to
get
you
out
if
you
pretend
to
be
him
with
that
he
bade
me
and
jumped
off
the
train
there
gentlemen
that
the
whole
story
just
as
it
happened
and
that
why
i
thought
it
was
colonel
jim
had
sent
you
to
get
me
free
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
convict
had
told
the
exact
truth
and
that
night
at
nine
he
identified
major
renn
as
the
former
colonel
jim
baxter
sanderson
placed
us
in
a
gallery
where
we
could
see
but
could
not
hear
the
old
man
seemed
determined
that
we
should
not
know
where
we
were
and
took
every
precaution
to
keep
us
in
the
dark
i
suppose
he
put
us
out
of
earshot
so
that
if
the
major
mentioned
the
name
of
the
nobleman
we
should
not
be
any
the
wiser
we
remained
in
the
gallery
for
some
time
after
the
major
had
left
before
sanderson
came
to
us
again
carrying
with
him
a
packet
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
door
he
said
with
your
permission
monsieur
valmont
i
will
accompany
you
to
your
flat
i
smiled
at
the
old
man
extreme
caution
but
he
continued
very
gravely
is
not
that
monsieur
valmont
i
wish
to
consult
with
you
and
if
you
will
accept
it
i
have
another
commission
to
offer
said
i
hope
it
is
not
so
unsavoury
as
the
last
but
to
this
the
old
man
made
no
response
there
was
silence
in
the
carriage
as
we
drove
back
to
my
flat
sanderson
had
taken
the
precaution
of
pulling
down
the
blinds
of
the
carriage
which
he
need
not
have
troubled
to
do
for
as
i
have
said
it
would
have
been
the
simplest
matter
in
the
world
for
me
to
have
discovered
who
his
employer
was
if
i
had
desired
to
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
whom
he
represented
once
more
in
my
room
with
the
electric
light
turned
on
i
was
shocked
and
astonished
to
see
the
expression
on
sanderson
face
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
would
grimly
commit
murder
and
hang
for
it
if
ever
the
thirst
for
vengeance
was
portrayed
on
a
human
countenance
it
was
on
his
that
night
he
spoke
very
quietly
laying
down
the
packet
before
him
on
the
table
think
you
will
agree
with
me
he
said
no
punishment
on
earth
is
too
severe
for
that
creature
calling
himself
major
renn
willing
to
shoot
him
dead
in
the
streets
of
london
tomorrow
said
the
convict
you
give
the
word
sanderson
went
on
implacably
not
only
murdered
the
son
but
for
five
years
has
kept
the
father
in
an
agony
of
sorrow
and
apprehension
bleeding
him
of
money
all
the
time
which
was
the
least
of
his
crimes
tomorrow
i
shall
tell
my
master
that
his
son
has
been
dead
these
five
years
and
heavy
as
that
blow
must
prove
it
will
be
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
his
son
died
an
honest
and
honourable
man
i
thank
you
for
offering
to
kill
this
vile
criminal
i
intend
that
he
shall
die
but
not
so
quickly
or
so
mercifully
here
he
untied
the
packet
and
took
from
it
a
photograph
which
he
handed
to
the
convict
you
recognise
that
yes
that
wyoming
ed
as
he
appeared
at
the
mine
as
indeed
he
appeared
when
he
was
shot
the
photograph
sanderson
then
handed
to
me
article
that
i
read
about
you
in
the
paper
monsieur
valmont
said
you
could
impersonate
anybody
can
you
impersonate
this
young
man
no
difficulty
in
that
i
replied
will
you
do
this
i
wish
you
two
to
dress
in
that
fashion
i
shall
give
you
particulars
of
the
haunts
of
major
renn
i
want
you
to
meet
him
together
and
separately
as
often
as
you
can
until
you
drive
him
mad
or
to
suicide
he
believes
you
to
be
dead
said
sanderson
addressing
jack
am
certain
he
has
the
news
by
his
manner
tonight
he
is
extremely
anxious
to
get
the
lump
sum
of
money
which
i
have
been
holding
back
from
him
you
may
address
him
for
he
will
recognise
your
voice
as
well
as
your
person
but
monsieur
valmont
had
better
not
speak
as
then
he
might
know
it
was
not
the
voice
of
my
poor
young
master
i
suggest
that
you
meet
him
first
together
always
at
night
the
rest
i
leave
in
your
hands
monsieur
valmont
with
that
the
old
man
rose
and
left
us
perhaps
i
should
stop
this
narration
here
for
i
have
often
wondered
if
practically
i
am
guilty
of
manslaughter
we
did
not
meet
major
renn
together
but
arranged
that
he
should
encounter
jack
under
one
and
me
under
the
next
it
was
just
after
midnight
and
the
streets
were
practically
deserted
the
theatre
crowds
had
gone
and
the
traffic
was
represented
by
the
last
and
a
belated
cab
now
and
then
major
renn
came
down
the
steps
of
his
club
and
under
the
first
with
the
light
shining
full
upon
him
jack
the
convict
stepped
forth
jim
he
said
and
i
are
waiting
for
you
there
were
three
in
that
robbery
and
one
was
a
traitor
his
dead
comrades
ask
the
traitor
to
join
them
the
major
staggered
back
against
the
drew
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
muttered
jack
told
me
afterwards
must
stop
drinking
i
must
stop
drinking
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
walked
rapidly
towards
the
next
i
stood
out
square
in
front
of
him
but
made
no
sound
he
looked
at
me
with
distended
eyes
while
jack
shouted
out
in
his
boisterous
voice
that
had
no
doubt
often
echoed
over
the
plain
on
wyoming
ed
and
never
mind
him
he
must
follow
then
he
gave
a
war
whoop
the
major
did
not
turn
round
but
continued
to
stare
at
me
breathing
stertorously
like
a
person
with
apoplexy
i
slowly
pushed
back
my
hat
and
on
my
brow
he
saw
the
red
mark
of
a
bullet
hole
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
fell
with
a
crash
to
the
pavement
failure
was
the
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
alicia
many
englishmen
if
you
speak
to
them
of
me
indulge
themselves
in
a
detraction
that
i
hope
they
will
not
mind
my
saying
is
rarely
graced
by
the
delicacy
of
innuendo
with
which
some
of
my
own
countrymen
attempt
to
diminish
whatever
merit
i
may
possess
spenser
hale
of
scotland
yard
whose
lack
of
imagination
i
have
so
often
endeavoured
to
amend
alas
without
perceptible
success
was
good
enough
to
say
after
i
had
begun
these
reminiscences
which
he
read
with
affected
scorn
that
i
was
wise
in
setting
down
my
successes
because
the
life
of
methuselah
himself
would
not
be
long
enough
to
chronicle
my
failures
and
the
man
to
whom
this
was
said
replied
that
it
was
only
my
artfulness
a
word
of
which
these
people
are
very
fond
that
i
intended
to
use
my
successes
as
bait
issue
a
small
pamphlet
filled
with
them
and
then
record
my
failures
in
a
thousand
volumes
after
the
plan
of
a
chinese
encyclopaedia
selling
these
to
the
public
on
the
instalment
plan
ah
well
it
is
not
for
me
to
pass
comment
on
such
observations
every
profession
is
marred
by
its
little
jealousies
and
why
should
the
coterie
of
detection
be
exempt
i
hope
i
may
never
follow
an
example
so
deleterious
and
thus
be
tempted
to
express
my
contempt
for
the
stupidity
with
which
as
all
persons
know
the
official
detective
system
of
england
is
imbued
i
have
had
my
failures
of
course
did
i
ever
pretend
to
be
otherwise
than
human
but
what
has
been
the
cause
of
these
failures
they
have
arisen
through
the
conservatism
of
the
english
when
there
is
a
mystery
to
be
solved
the
average
englishman
almost
invariably
places
it
in
the
hands
of
the
regular
police
when
these
good
people
are
utterly
baffled
when
their
big
boots
have
crushed
out
all
evidences
that
the
grounds
may
have
had
to
offer
to
a
discerning
mind
when
their
clumsy
hands
have
obliterated
the
clues
which
are
everywhere
around
them
i
am
at
last
called
in
and
if
i
fail
they
say
could
you
expect
he
is
a
frenchman
this
was
exactly
what
happened
in
the
case
of
lady
alicia
emeralds
for
two
months
the
regular
police
were
not
only
befogged
but
they
blatantly
sounded
the
alarm
to
every
thief
in
europe
all
the
pawnbrokers
shops
of
great
britain
were
ransacked
as
if
a
robber
of
so
valuable
a
collection
would
be
foolish
enough
to
take
it
to
a
pawnbroker
of
course
the
police
say
that
they
thought
the
thief
would
dismantle
the
cluster
and
sell
the
gems
separately
as
to
this
necklace
of
emeralds
possessing
as
it
does
an
historical
value
which
is
probably
in
excess
of
its
intrinsic
worth
what
more
natural
than
that
the
holder
of
it
should
open
negotiations
with
its
rightful
owner
and
thus
make
more
money
by
quietly
restoring
it
than
by
its
dismemberment
and
sale
piecemeal
but
such
a
fuss
was
kicked
up
such
a
furore
created
that
it
is
no
wonder
the
receiver
of
the
goods
lay
low
and
said
nothing
in
vain
were
all
ports
giving
access
to
the
continent
watched
in
vain
were
the
police
of
france
belgium
and
holland
warned
to
look
out
for
this
treasure
two
valuable
months
were
lost
and
then
the
marquis
of
blair
sent
for
me
i
maintain
that
the
case
was
hopeless
from
the
moment
i
took
it
up
it
may
be
asked
why
the
marquis
of
blair
allowed
the
regular
police
to
blunder
along
for
two
precious
months
but
anyone
who
is
acquainted
with
that
nobleman
will
not
wonder
that
he
clung
so
long
to
a
forlorn
hope
very
few
members
of
the
house
of
peers
are
richer
than
lord
blair
and
still
fewer
more
penurious
he
maintained
that
as
he
paid
his
taxes
he
was
entitled
to
protection
from
theft
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
to
restore
the
gems
and
if
this
proved
impossible
to
make
compensation
for
them
this
theory
is
not
acceptable
in
the
english
courts
and
while
scotland
yard
did
all
it
could
during
those
two
months
what
but
failure
was
to
be
expected
from
its
limited
mental
equipment
when
i
arrived
at
the
manor
of
blair
as
his
lordship
very
ugly
and
somewhat
modern
mansion
house
is
termed
i
was
instantly
admitted
to
his
presence
i
had
been
summoned
from
london
by
a
letter
in
his
lordship
own
hand
on
which
the
postage
was
not
paid
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
i
arrived
and
our
first
conference
was
what
might
be
termed
futile
it
was
take
up
entirely
with
haggling
about
terms
the
marquis
endeavouring
to
beat
down
the
price
of
my
services
to
a
sum
so
insignificant
that
it
would
barely
have
paid
my
expenses
from
london
to
blair
and
back
such
bargaining
is
intensely
distasteful
to
me
when
the
marquis
found
all
his
offers
declined
with
a
politeness
which
left
no
opening
for
anger
on
his
part
he
endeavoured
to
induce
me
to
take
up
the
case
on
a
commission
contingent
upon
my
recovery
of
the
gems
and
as
i
had
declined
this
for
the
twentieth
time
darkness
had
come
on
and
the
gong
rang
for
dinner
i
dined
alone
in
the
à
which
appeared
to
be
set
apart
for
those
calling
at
the
mansion
on
business
and
the
meagreness
of
the
fare
together
with
the
indifferent
nature
of
the
claret
strengthened
my
determination
to
return
to
london
as
early
as
possible
next
morning
when
the
repast
was
finished
the
dignified
servingman
said
gravely
to
me
lady
alicia
asks
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
give
her
a
few
moments
in
the
sir
i
followed
the
man
to
the
and
found
the
young
lady
seated
at
the
piano
on
which
she
was
strumming
idly
and
absentmindedly
but
with
a
touch
nevertheless
that
indicated
advanced
excellence
in
the
art
of
music
she
was
not
dressed
as
one
who
had
just
risen
from
the
dining
table
but
was
somewhat
grimly
and
commonly
attired
looking
more
like
a
cottager
daughter
than
a
member
of
the
great
country
family
her
head
was
small
and
crowned
with
a
mass
of
jet
black
hair
my
first
impression
on
entering
the
large
rather
dimly
lighted
room
was
unfavourable
but
that
vanished
instantly
under
the
charm
of
a
manner
so
graceful
and
vivacious
that
in
a
moment
i
seemed
to
be
standing
in
a
brilliant
parisian
rather
than
in
the
sombre
of
an
english
country
house
every
poise
of
her
dainty
head
every
gesture
of
those
small
perfect
hands
every
modulated
tone
of
the
voice
whether
sparkling
with
laughter
or
caressing
in
confidential
speech
reminded
me
of
the
of
my
own
land
it
was
strange
to
find
this
perfect
human
flower
amidst
the
gloomy
ugliness
of
a
huge
square
house
built
in
the
time
of
the
georges
but
i
remembered
now
that
the
blairs
are
the
english
equivalent
of
the
de
bellairs
of
france
from
which
family
sprang
the
fascinating
marquise
de
bellairs
who
adorned
the
court
of
louis
xiv
here
advancing
towards
me
was
the
very
reincarnation
of
the
lovely
marquise
who
gave
lustre
to
this
dull
world
nearly
three
hundred
years
ago
ah
after
all
what
are
the
english
but
a
conquered
race
i
often
forget
this
and
i
trust
i
never
remind
them
of
it
but
it
enables
one
to
forgive
them
much
a
vivid
marquise
was
lady
alicia
in
all
except
attire
what
a
dream
some
of
our
parisian
dress
artists
could
have
made
of
her
and
here
she
was
immured
in
this
dull
english
house
in
the
costume
of
a
labourer
wife
monsieur
valmont
she
cried
in
french
of
almost
faultless
intonation
am
so
glad
you
have
arrived
and
she
greeted
me
as
if
i
were
an
old
friend
of
the
family
there
was
nothing
of
condescension
in
her
manner
no
display
of
her
own
affability
while
at
the
same
time
teaching
me
my
place
and
the
difference
in
our
stations
of
life
i
can
stand
the
rudeness
of
the
nobility
but
i
detest
their
condescension
no
lady
alicia
was
a
true
de
bellairs
and
in
my
confusion
bending
over
her
slender
hand
i
said
la
marquise
it
is
a
privilege
to
extend
to
you
my
most
respectful
salutations
she
laughed
at
this
quietly
with
the
melting
laugh
of
the
nightingale
you
mistake
my
title
although
my
uncle
is
a
marquis
i
am
but
lady
alicia
pardon
my
lady
for
the
moment
i
was
back
in
that
scintillating
court
which
surrounded
louis
le
grand
flatteringly
you
introduce
yourself
monsieur
in
the
gallery
upstairs
there
is
a
painting
of
the
marquise
de
bellairs
and
when
i
show
it
to
your
tomorrow
you
will
then
understand
how
charmingly
you
have
pleased
a
vain
woman
by
your
reference
to
that
beautiful
lady
but
i
must
not
talk
in
this
frivolous
strain
monsieur
there
is
serious
business
to
be
considered
and
i
assure
you
i
looked
forward
to
your
coming
monsieur
with
the
eagerness
of
sister
anne
in
the
tower
of
bluebeard
i
fear
my
expression
as
i
bowed
to
her
must
have
betrayed
my
gratification
at
hearing
these
words
so
confidentially
uttered
by
lips
so
sweet
while
the
glance
of
her
lovely
eyes
was
even
more
eloquent
than
her
words
instantly
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
chaffering
over
terms
with
her
uncle
instantly
i
forgot
my
resolution
to
depart
on
the
morrow
instantly
i
resolved
to
be
of
what
assistance
i
could
to
this
dainty
lady
alas
the
heart
of
valmont
is
today
as
unprotected
against
the
artillery
of
inspiring
eyes
as
ever
it
was
in
his
extreme
youth
house
she
continued
vivaciously
been
practically
in
a
state
of
siege
for
two
months
i
could
take
none
of
my
usual
walks
in
the
gardens
on
the
lawns
or
through
the
park
without
some
clumsy
policeman
in
uniform
crashing
his
way
through
the
bushes
or
some
detective
in
plain
clothes
accosting
me
and
questioning
me
under
the
pretence
that
he
was
a
stranger
who
had
lost
his
way
the
lack
of
all
subtlety
in
our
police
is
something
deplorable
i
am
sure
the
real
criminal
might
have
passed
through
their
hands
a
dozen
times
unmolested
while
our
poor
innocent
servants
and
the
strangers
within
our
gates
were
made
to
feel
that
the
stern
eye
of
the
law
was
upon
them
night
and
day
the
face
of
the
young
lady
was
an
entrancing
picture
of
animated
indignation
as
she
gave
utterance
to
this
truism
which
her
countrymen
are
so
slow
to
appreciate
i
experienced
a
glow
of
satisfaction
she
went
on
sent
down
from
london
an
army
of
stupid
men
who
have
kept
our
household
in
a
state
of
abject
terror
for
eight
long
weeks
and
where
are
the
emeralds
as
she
suddenly
asked
this
question
in
the
most
parisian
of
accents
with
a
little
outward
spreading
of
the
hand
a
flash
of
the
eye
and
a
toss
of
the
head
the
united
effect
was
something
indescribable
through
the
limitations
of
the
language
i
am
compelled
to
use
monsieur
your
arrival
has
put
to
flight
this
tiresome
brigade
if
indeed
the
word
flight
is
not
too
airy
a
term
to
use
towards
a
company
so
elephantine
and
i
assure
you
a
sigh
of
relief
has
gone
up
from
the
whole
household
with
the
exception
of
my
uncle
i
said
to
him
at
dinner
tonight
if
monsieur
valmont
had
been
induced
to
take
an
interest
in
the
case
at
first
the
jewels
would
have
been
in
my
possession
long
before
tonight
my
lady
i
protested
fear
you
overrate
my
poor
ability
it
is
quite
true
that
if
i
had
been
called
in
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
my
chances
of
success
would
have
been
infinitely
greater
than
they
are
now
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
over
her
knees
and
leaning
towards
me
hypnotising
me
with
those
starry
eyes
i
am
perfectly
confident
that
before
a
week
is
past
you
will
restore
the
necklace
if
such
restoration
be
possible
i
have
said
so
from
the
first
now
am
i
right
in
my
conjecture
monsieur
that
you
come
here
alone
that
you
bring
with
you
no
train
of
followers
and
assistants
is
as
you
have
stated
it
my
lady
was
sure
of
it
it
is
to
be
a
contest
of
trained
mentality
in
opposition
to
our
two
months
experience
of
brute
force
never
before
had
i
felt
such
ambition
to
succeed
and
a
determination
not
to
disappoint
took
full
possession
of
me
appreciation
is
a
needed
stimulant
and
here
it
was
offered
to
me
in
its
most
intoxicating
form
ah
valmont
valmont
will
you
never
grow
old
i
am
sure
that
at
this
moment
if
i
had
been
eighty
the
same
thrill
of
enthusiasm
would
have
tingled
to
my
fingers
ends
leave
the
manor
of
blair
in
the
morning
not
for
the
bank
of
france
my
uncle
acquainted
you
with
particulars
of
the
robbery
madame
we
were
talking
of
other
things
the
lady
leaned
back
in
her
low
chair
partially
closed
her
eyes
and
breathed
a
deep
sigh
can
well
imagine
the
subject
of
your
conversation
she
said
at
last
marquis
of
blair
was
endeavouring
to
impose
usurer
terms
upon
you
while
you
nobly
scorning
such
mercenary
considerations
had
perhaps
resolved
to
leave
us
at
the
earliest
opportunity
assure
you
my
lady
that
if
any
such
conclusion
had
been
arrived
at
on
my
part
it
vanished
the
moment
i
was
privileged
to
set
foot
in
this
is
kind
of
you
to
say
that
monsieur
but
you
must
not
allow
your
conversation
with
my
uncle
to
prejudice
you
against
him
he
is
an
old
man
now
and
of
course
has
his
fancies
you
would
think
him
mercenary
perhaps
and
so
he
is
but
then
so
too
am
oh
yes
i
am
monsieur
frightfully
mercenary
to
be
mercenary
i
believe
means
to
be
fond
of
money
no
one
is
fonder
of
money
than
i
except
perhaps
my
uncle
but
you
see
monsieur
we
occupy
the
two
extremes
he
is
fond
of
money
to
hoard
it
i
am
fond
of
money
to
spend
it
i
am
fond
of
money
for
the
things
it
will
buy
i
should
like
to
scatter
largesse
as
did
my
fair
ancestress
in
france
i
should
love
a
manor
house
in
the
country
and
a
mansion
in
mayfair
i
could
wish
to
make
everyone
around
me
happy
if
the
expenditure
of
money
would
do
it
is
a
form
of
lady
alicia
which
will
find
a
multitude
of
admirers
the
girl
shook
her
head
and
laughed
merrily
should
so
dislike
to
forfeit
your
esteem
monsieur
valmont
and
therefore
i
shall
not
reveal
the
depth
of
my
cupidity
you
will
learn
that
probably
from
my
uncle
and
then
you
will
understand
my
extreme
anxiety
for
the
recovery
of
these
jewels
they
very
valuable
yes
the
necklace
consists
of
twenty
stones
no
one
of
which
weighs
less
than
an
ounce
altogether
i
believe
they
amount
to
two
thousand
four
hundred
or
two
thousand
five
hundred
carats
and
their
intrinsic
value
is
twenty
pounds
a
carat
at
least
so
you
see
that
means
nearly
fifty
thousand
pounds
yet
even
this
sum
is
trivial
compared
with
what
it
involves
there
is
something
like
a
million
at
stake
together
with
my
coveted
manor
house
in
the
country
and
my
equally
coveted
mansion
in
mayfair
all
this
is
within
my
grasp
if
i
can
but
recover
the
emeralds
the
girl
blushed
prettily
as
she
noticed
how
intently
i
regarded
her
while
she
evolved
this
tantalising
mystery
i
thought
there
was
a
trace
of
embarrassment
in
her
laugh
when
she
cried
what
will
you
think
of
me
when
you
understand
the
situation
pray
pray
do
not
judge
me
harshly
i
assure
you
the
position
i
aim
at
will
be
used
for
the
good
of
others
as
well
as
for
my
own
pleasure
if
my
uncle
does
not
make
a
confidant
of
you
i
must
take
my
courage
in
both
hands
and
give
you
all
the
particulars
but
not
tonight
of
course
if
one
is
to
unravel
such
a
snarl
as
that
in
which
we
find
ourselves
he
must
be
made
aware
of
every
particular
must
he
not
my
lady
well
monsieur
valmont
i
shall
supply
any
deficiencies
that
occur
in
my
uncle
conversation
with
you
there
is
one
point
on
which
i
should
like
to
warn
you
both
my
uncle
and
the
police
have
made
up
their
minds
that
a
certain
young
man
is
the
culprit
the
police
found
several
clues
which
apparently
led
in
his
direction
but
they
were
unable
to
find
enough
to
justify
his
arrest
at
first
i
could
have
sworn
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
but
lately
i
am
not
so
sure
all
i
ask
of
you
until
we
secure
another
opportunity
of
consulting
together
is
to
preserve
an
open
mind
please
do
not
allow
my
uncle
to
prejudice
you
against
him
is
the
name
of
this
young
man
is
the
honourable
john
haddon
honourable
is
he
a
person
who
could
do
so
dishonourable
an
action
the
young
lady
shook
her
head
am
almost
sure
he
would
not
and
yet
one
never
can
tell
i
think
at
the
present
moment
there
are
one
or
two
noble
lords
in
prison
but
their
crimes
have
not
been
mere
vulgar
housebreaking
i
to
infer
lady
alicia
that
you
are
in
possession
of
certain
facts
unknown
either
to
your
uncle
or
the
police
me
but
do
these
facts
tend
to
incriminate
the
young
man
again
the
young
lady
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
gazed
past
me
a
wrinkle
of
perplexity
on
her
fair
brow
then
she
said
very
slowly
will
understand
monsieur
valmont
how
loath
i
am
to
speak
against
one
who
was
formerly
a
friend
if
he
had
been
content
to
remain
a
friend
i
am
sure
this
incident
which
has
caused
us
all
such
worry
and
trouble
would
never
have
happened
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
on
what
my
uncle
will
tell
you
was
a
very
unpleasant
episode
but
the
honourable
john
haddon
is
a
poor
man
and
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
for
one
brought
up
as
i
have
been
to
marry
into
poverty
he
was
very
headstrong
and
reckless
about
the
matter
and
involved
my
uncle
in
a
bitter
quarrel
while
discussing
it
much
to
my
chagrin
and
disappointment
it
is
as
necessary
for
him
to
marry
wealth
as
it
is
for
me
to
make
a
good
match
but
he
could
not
be
brought
to
see
that
oh
he
is
not
at
all
a
sensible
young
man
and
my
former
friendship
for
him
has
ceased
yet
i
should
dislike
very
much
to
take
any
action
that
might
harm
him
therefore
i
have
spoken
to
no
one
but
you
about
the
evidence
that
is
in
my
hands
and
this
you
must
treat
as
entirely
confidential
giving
no
hint
to
my
uncle
who
is
already
bitter
enough
against
mr
haddon
this
evidence
convince
you
that
he
stole
the
necklace
i
do
not
believe
that
he
actually
stole
it
but
i
am
persuaded
he
was
an
accessory
after
the
fact
is
that
the
legal
term
now
monsieur
valmont
we
will
say
no
more
tonight
if
i
talk
any
longer
about
this
crisis
i
shall
not
sleep
and
i
wish
assured
of
your
help
to
attack
the
situation
with
a
very
clear
mind
tomorrow
when
i
retired
to
my
room
i
found
that
i
too
could
not
sleep
although
i
needed
a
clear
mind
to
face
the
problem
of
tomorrow
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
describe
accurately
the
effect
this
interview
had
upon
my
mind
but
to
use
a
bodily
simile
i
may
say
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
indulged
too
freely
in
a
subtle
champagne
which
appeared
exceedingly
excellent
at
first
but
from
which
the
exhilaration
had
now
departed
no
man
could
have
been
more
completely
under
a
spell
than
i
was
when
lady
alicia
eyes
first
told
me
more
than
her
lips
revealed
but
although
i
had
challenged
her
right
to
the
title
when
she
applied
it
to
herself
i
could
not
but
confess
that
her
nonchalant
recital
regarding
the
friend
who
desired
to
be
a
lover
jarred
upon
me
i
found
my
sympathy
extending
itself
to
that
unknown
young
man
on
whom
it
appeared
the
shadow
of
suspicion
already
rested
i
was
confident
that
if
he
had
actually
taken
the
emeralds
it
was
not
at
all
from
motives
of
cupidity
indeed
that
was
practically
shown
by
the
fact
that
scotland
yard
found
itself
unable
to
trace
the
jewels
which
at
least
they
might
have
done
if
the
necklace
had
been
sold
either
as
a
whole
or
dismembered
of
course
an
emerald
weighing
an
ounce
is
by
no
means
unusual
the
hope
emerald
for
example
weighs
six
ounces
and
the
gem
owned
by
the
duke
of
devonshire
measures
two
and
a
quarter
inches
through
its
greatest
diameter
nevertheless
such
a
constellation
as
the
blair
emeralds
was
not
to
be
disposed
of
very
easily
and
i
surmised
no
attempt
had
been
made
either
to
sell
them
or
to
raise
money
upon
them
now
that
i
had
removed
myself
from
the
glamour
of
her
presence
i
began
to
suspect
that
the
young
lady
after
all
although
undoubtedly
possessing
the
brilliancy
of
her
jewels
retained
also
something
of
their
hardness
there
had
been
no
expression
of
sympathy
for
the
discarded
friend
it
was
too
evident
recalling
what
had
latterly
passed
between
us
that
the
young
sole
desire
and
a
perfectly
natural
desire
was
to
recover
her
missing
treasure
there
was
something
behind
all
this
which
i
could
not
comprehend
and
i
resolved
in
the
morning
to
question
the
marquis
of
blair
as
shrewdly
as
he
cared
to
allow
failing
him
i
should
the
niece
in
a
somewhat
dryer
light
than
that
which
had
enshrouded
me
during
this
interesting
evening
i
care
not
who
knows
it
but
i
have
been
befooled
more
than
once
by
a
woman
but
i
determined
that
in
clear
daylight
i
should
resist
the
hypnotising
influence
of
those
glorious
eyes
dieu
mon
how
easy
it
is
for
me
to
make
good
resolutions
when
i
am
far
from
temptation
it
was
ten
next
morning
when
i
was
admitted
to
the
study
of
the
aged
bachelor
marquis
of
blair
his
keen
eyes
looked
through
and
through
me
as
i
seated
myself
before
him
he
said
shortly
lord
i
began
deliberately
know
nothing
more
of
the
case
than
was
furnished
by
the
accounts
i
have
read
in
the
newspapers
two
months
have
elapsed
since
the
robbery
every
day
that
passed
made
the
detection
of
the
criminal
more
difficult
i
do
not
wish
to
waste
either
my
time
or
your
money
on
a
forlorn
hope
if
therefore
you
will
be
good
enough
to
place
me
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
known
to
you
i
shall
tell
you
at
once
whether
or
not
i
can
take
up
the
case
you
wish
me
to
give
you
the
name
of
the
criminal
asked
his
lordship
his
name
known
to
you
i
asked
in
return
john
haddon
stole
the
necklace
you
give
that
name
to
the
police
did
they
arrest
him
the
evidence
against
him
is
so
small
and
the
improbability
of
his
having
committed
the
crime
is
so
great
is
the
evidence
against
him
his
lordship
spoke
with
the
dry
deliberation
of
an
aged
solicitor
robbery
was
committed
on
the
night
of
october
the
fifth
all
day
there
had
been
a
heavy
rain
and
the
grounds
were
wet
for
reasons
into
which
i
do
not
care
to
enter
john
haddon
was
familiar
with
this
house
and
with
our
grounds
he
was
well
known
to
my
servants
and
unfortunately
popular
with
them
for
he
is
an
openhanded
spendthrift
the
estate
of
his
elder
brother
lord
steffenham
adjoins
my
own
to
the
west
and
lord
steffenham
house
is
three
miles
from
where
we
sit
on
the
night
of
the
fifth
a
ball
was
given
in
the
mansion
of
lord
steffenham
to
which
of
course
my
niece
and
myself
were
invited
and
which
invitation
we
accepted
i
had
no
quarrel
with
the
elder
brother
it
was
known
to
john
haddon
that
my
niece
intended
to
wear
her
necklace
of
emeralds
the
robbery
occurred
at
a
time
when
most
crimes
of
that
nature
are
committed
in
country
houses
namely
while
we
were
at
dinner
an
hour
during
which
the
servants
are
almost
invariably
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
in
october
the
days
are
getting
short
the
night
was
exceptionally
dark
for
although
the
rain
had
ceased
not
a
star
was
visible
the
thief
placed
a
ladder
against
the
sill
of
one
of
the
upper
windows
opened
it
and
came
in
he
must
have
been
perfectly
familiar
with
the
house
for
there
are
evidences
that
he
went
direct
to
the
boudoir
where
the
jewel
case
had
been
carelessly
left
on
my
niece
dressing
table
when
she
came
down
to
dinner
it
had
been
taken
from
the
strong
room
about
an
hour
before
the
box
was
locked
but
of
course
that
made
no
difference
the
thief
wrenched
the
lid
off
breaking
the
lock
stole
the
necklace
and
escaped
by
the
way
he
came
he
leave
the
window
open
and
the
ladder
in
place
that
strike
you
as
very
extraordinary
i
do
not
assert
that
he
is
a
professional
burglar
who
would
take
all
the
precautions
against
the
discovery
that
might
have
been
expected
from
one
of
the
craft
indeed
the
man
carelessness
in
going
straight
across
the
country
to
his
brother
house
and
leaving
footsteps
in
the
soft
earth
easily
traceable
almost
to
the
very
boundary
fence
shows
he
is
incapable
of
any
serious
thought
john
haddon
rich
has
a
penny
you
go
to
the
ball
that
night
i
had
promised
to
go
john
haddon
there
but
he
appeared
late
he
should
have
been
present
at
the
opening
and
his
brother
was
seriously
annoyed
by
his
absence
when
he
did
come
he
acted
in
a
wild
and
reckless
manner
which
gave
the
guests
the
impression
that
he
had
been
drinking
both
my
niece
and
myself
were
disgusted
with
his
actions
you
think
your
niece
suspects
him
certainly
did
not
at
first
and
was
indignant
when
i
told
her
coming
home
from
the
ball
that
her
jewels
were
undoubtedly
in
steffenham
house
even
though
they
were
not
round
her
neck
but
latterly
i
think
her
opinion
has
changed
go
back
a
moment
did
any
of
your
servants
see
him
prowling
about
the
place
all
say
they
did
but
i
myself
saw
him
just
before
dusk
coming
across
the
fields
towards
this
house
and
next
morning
we
found
the
same
footprints
both
going
and
coming
it
seems
to
me
the
circumstantial
evidence
is
rather
strong
a
pity
that
no
one
but
yourself
saw
him
what
more
evidence
are
the
authorities
waiting
for
are
waiting
until
he
attempts
to
dispose
of
the
jewels
think
then
he
has
not
done
so
up
to
date
think
he
will
never
do
so
why
did
he
steal
them
prevent
the
marriage
of
my
niece
with
jonas
carter
of
sheffield
to
whom
she
is
betrothed
they
were
to
be
married
early
in
the
new
year
lord
you
amaze
me
if
carter
and
lady
alicia
are
engaged
why
should
the
theft
of
the
jewels
interfere
with
the
ceremony
jonas
carter
is
a
most
estimable
man
who
however
does
not
move
in
our
sphere
of
life
he
is
connected
with
the
steel
or
cutlery
industry
and
is
a
person
of
great
wealth
rising
upwards
of
a
million
with
a
large
estate
in
derbyshire
and
a
house
fronting
hyde
park
in
london
he
is
a
very
strict
business
man
and
both
my
niece
and
myself
agree
that
he
is
also
an
eligible
man
i
myself
am
rather
strict
in
matters
of
business
and
i
must
admit
that
carter
showed
a
very
generous
spirit
in
arranging
the
preliminaries
of
the
engagement
with
me
when
alicia
father
died
he
had
run
through
all
the
money
he
himself
possessed
or
could
borrow
from
his
friends
although
a
man
of
noble
birth
i
never
liked
him
he
was
married
to
my
only
sister
the
blair
emeralds
as
perhaps
you
know
descend
down
the
female
line
they
therefore
came
to
my
niece
from
her
mother
my
poor
sister
had
long
been
disillusioned
before
death
released
her
from
the
titled
scamp
she
had
married
and
she
very
wisely
placed
the
emeralds
in
my
custody
to
be
held
in
trust
for
her
daughter
they
constitute
my
niece
only
fortune
and
would
produce
if
offered
in
london
today
probably
or
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
although
actually
they
are
not
worth
so
much
jonas
carter
very
amiably
consented
to
receive
my
niece
with
a
dowry
of
only
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
that
money
i
offered
to
advance
if
i
was
allowed
to
retain
the
jewels
as
security
this
was
arranged
between
carter
and
myself
surely
carter
does
not
refuse
to
carry
out
his
engagement
because
the
jewels
have
been
stolen
does
why
should
he
not
surely
you
will
advance
the
fifty
thousand
necessary
will
not
why
should
i
it
seems
to
me
said
i
with
a
slight
laugh
young
man
has
very
definitely
checkmated
both
of
you
has
until
i
have
laid
him
by
the
heels
which
i
am
determined
to
do
if
he
were
the
brother
of
twenty
lord
steffenhams
answer
one
more
question
are
you
determined
to
put
the
young
man
in
prison
or
would
you
be
content
with
the
return
of
the
emeralds
intact
course
i
should
prefer
to
put
him
in
prison
and
get
the
emeralds
too
but
if
there
no
choice
in
the
matter
i
must
content
myself
with
the
necklace
well
my
lord
i
will
undertake
the
case
this
conference
had
detained
us
in
the
study
till
after
eleven
and
then
as
it
was
a
clear
crisp
december
morning
i
went
out
through
the
gardens
into
the
park
that
i
might
walk
along
the
private
road
and
meditate
upon
my
course
of
action
or
rather
think
over
what
had
been
said
because
i
could
not
map
my
route
until
i
had
heard
the
secret
which
the
lady
alicia
promised
to
impart
as
at
present
instructed
it
seemed
to
me
the
best
way
to
go
direct
to
the
young
man
show
him
as
effectively
as
i
could
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
and
if
possible
persuade
him
to
deliver
up
the
necklace
to
me
as
i
strolled
along
under
the
grand
old
leafless
trees
i
suddenly
heard
my
name
called
impulsively
two
or
three
times
and
turning
round
saw
the
lady
alicia
running
toward
me
her
cheeks
were
bright
with
nature
rouge
and
her
eyes
sparkled
more
dazzlingly
than
any
emerald
that
ever
tempted
man
to
wickedness
monsieur
valmont
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
and
you
escaped
me
have
you
seen
my
uncle
i
have
been
with
him
since
ten
ladyship
that
is
exactly
the
word
with
which
he
accosted
me
you
see
an
additional
likeness
between
my
uncle
and
myself
this
morning
then
has
he
told
you
about
mr
carter
now
you
understand
how
important
it
is
that
i
should
regain
possession
of
my
property
i
said
with
a
sigh
house
near
hyde
park
and
the
great
estate
in
derbyshire
she
clapped
her
hands
with
glee
eyes
and
feet
dancing
in
unison
as
she
capered
along
gaily
beside
me
a
sort
of
sideways
keeping
pace
with
my
more
stately
step
as
if
she
were
a
little
girl
of
six
instead
of
a
young
woman
of
twenty
only
that
she
cried
one
million
pounds
to
spend
oh
monsieur
valmont
you
know
paris
and
yet
you
do
not
seem
to
comprehend
what
that
plethora
of
money
means
madame
i
have
seen
paris
and
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
but
i
am
not
so
certain
you
will
secure
the
million
to
spend
she
cried
stopping
short
that
little
wrinkle
which
betokened
temper
appearing
on
her
brow
you
think
we
wo
get
the
emeralds
then
i
am
sure
we
will
get
the
emeralds
i
valmont
pledge
you
my
word
but
if
jonas
carter
before
marriage
calls
a
halt
upon
the
ceremony
until
your
uncle
places
fifty
thousand
pounds
upon
the
table
i
confess
i
am
very
pessimistic
about
your
obtaining
control
of
the
million
afterwards
all
her
vivacity
instantaneously
returned
she
cried
dancing
round
in
front
of
me
and
standing
there
directly
in
my
path
so
that
i
came
to
a
stand
she
repeated
snapping
her
fingers
with
an
inimitable
gesture
of
that
lovely
hand
valmont
i
am
disappointed
in
you
you
are
not
nearly
so
nice
as
you
were
last
evening
it
is
very
uncomplimentary
in
you
to
intimate
that
when
once
i
am
married
to
jonas
i
shall
not
wheedle
from
him
all
the
money
i
want
do
not
rest
your
eyes
on
the
ground
look
at
me
and
answer
i
glanced
up
at
her
and
could
not
forbear
laughing
the
witchery
of
the
wood
was
in
that
girl
yes
and
a
perceptible
trace
of
the
gallic
devil
flickered
in
those
enchanting
eyes
of
hers
i
could
not
help
myself
madame
la
marquise
de
bellairs
how
jauntily
you
would
scatter
despair
in
that
susceptible
court
of
louis
monsieur
eugène
de
valmont
she
cried
mimicking
my
tones
and
imitating
my
manner
with
an
exactitude
that
amazed
me
are
once
more
my
dear
de
valmont
of
last
night
i
dreamed
of
you
i
assure
you
i
did
and
now
to
find
you
in
the
morning
oh
so
changed
she
clasped
her
little
hands
and
inclined
her
head
while
the
sweet
voice
sank
into
a
cadence
of
melancholy
which
seemed
so
genuine
that
the
mocking
ripple
of
a
laugh
immediately
following
was
almost
a
shock
to
me
where
had
this
creature
of
the
dull
english
countryside
learnt
all
such
of
gesture
and
tone
you
ever
seen
sarah
bernhardt
i
asked
now
the
average
english
woman
would
have
inquired
the
genesis
of
so
inconsequent
a
question
but
lady
alicia
followed
the
trend
of
my
thought
and
answered
at
once
as
if
my
query
had
been
quite
expected
monsieur
sarah
the
divine
ah
she
comes
with
my
million
a
year
and
the
house
of
hyde
park
no
the
only
inhabitant
of
my
real
world
whom
i
have
yet
seen
is
monsieur
valmont
and
he
alas
i
find
so
changeable
but
now
adieu
frivolity
we
must
be
serious
and
she
walked
sedately
by
my
side
you
know
where
you
are
going
monsieur
you
are
going
to
church
oh
do
not
look
frightened
not
to
a
service
i
am
decorating
the
church
with
holly
and
you
shall
help
me
and
get
thorns
in
your
poor
fingers
the
private
road
which
up
to
this
time
had
passed
through
a
forest
now
reached
a
secluded
glade
in
which
stood
a
very
small
but
exquisite
church
evidently
centuries
older
than
the
mansion
we
had
left
beyond
it
were
gray
stone
ruins
which
lady
alicia
pointed
out
to
me
as
remnants
of
the
original
mansion
that
had
been
built
in
the
reign
of
the
second
henry
the
church
it
was
thought
formed
the
private
chapel
to
the
hall
and
it
had
been
kept
in
repair
by
the
various
lords
of
the
manor
hearken
to
the
power
of
the
poor
and
learn
how
they
may
flout
the
proud
marquis
cried
lady
alicia
gleefully
poorest
man
in
england
may
walk
along
this
private
road
on
sunday
to
the
church
and
the
proud
marquis
is
powerless
to
prevent
him
of
course
if
the
poor
man
prolongs
his
walk
then
is
he
in
danger
from
the
law
of
trespass
on
weekdays
however
this
is
the
most
secluded
spot
on
the
estate
and
i
regret
to
say
that
my
lordly
uncle
does
not
trouble
it
even
on
sundays
i
fear
we
are
a
degenerate
race
monsieur
valmont
for
doubtless
a
fighting
and
deeply
religious
ancestor
of
mine
built
this
church
and
to
think
that
when
the
useful
masons
cemented
those
stones
together
madame
la
marquise
de
bellairs
or
lady
alicia
were
alike
unthought
of
and
though
three
hundred
years
divide
them
this
ancient
chapel
makes
them
seem
as
one
might
say
contemporaries
oh
monsieur
valmont
what
is
the
use
of
worrying
about
emeralds
or
anything
else
as
i
look
at
this
beautiful
old
church
even
the
house
of
hyde
park
appears
as
naught
and
to
my
amazement
the
eyes
that
lady
alicia
turned
upon
me
were
wet
the
front
door
was
unlocked
and
we
walked
into
the
church
in
silence
around
the
pillars
holly
and
ivy
were
twined
great
armfuls
of
the
shrubs
had
been
flung
here
and
there
along
the
walls
in
heaps
and
a
stood
in
one
of
the
aisles
showing
that
the
decoration
of
the
edifice
was
not
yet
complete
a
subdued
melancholy
had
settled
down
on
my
erstwhile
vivacious
companion
the
inevitable
reaction
so
characteristic
of
the
artistic
temperament
augmented
doubtless
by
the
solemnity
of
the
place
around
whose
walls
in
brass
and
marble
were
sculptured
memorials
of
her
ancient
race
promised
i
said
at
last
tell
me
how
you
came
to
suspect
here
not
here
she
whispered
then
rising
from
the
pew
in
which
she
had
seated
herself
she
said
us
go
i
am
in
no
mood
for
working
this
morning
i
shall
finish
the
decoration
in
the
afternoon
we
came
out
into
the
cool
and
brilliant
sunlight
again
and
as
we
turned
homeward
her
spirits
immediately
began
to
rise
am
anxious
to
know
i
persisted
you
came
to
suspect
a
man
whom
at
first
you
believed
innocent
am
not
sure
but
i
believe
him
innocent
now
although
i
am
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
he
knows
where
the
treasure
is
forces
you
to
that
conclusion
my
lady
letter
i
received
from
himself
in
which
he
makes
a
proposal
so
extraordinary
that
i
am
almost
disinclined
to
accede
to
it
even
though
it
leads
to
the
discovery
of
my
necklace
however
i
am
determined
to
leave
no
means
untried
if
i
receive
the
support
of
my
friend
monsieur
valmont
lady
said
i
with
a
bow
is
but
yours
to
command
mine
to
obey
what
were
the
contents
of
that
letter
it
she
replied
taking
the
folded
sheet
from
her
pocket
and
handing
it
to
me
she
had
been
quite
right
in
characterising
the
note
as
an
extraordinary
epistle
the
honourable
john
haddon
had
the
temerity
to
propose
that
she
should
go
through
a
form
of
marriage
with
him
in
the
old
church
we
had
just
left
if
she
did
that
he
said
it
would
console
him
for
the
mad
love
he
felt
for
her
the
ceremony
would
have
no
binding
force
upon
her
whatever
and
she
might
bring
whom
she
pleased
to
perform
it
if
she
knew
no
one
that
she
could
trust
he
would
invite
an
old
college
chum
and
bring
him
to
the
church
next
morning
at
seven
even
if
an
ordained
clergyman
performed
the
ceremony
it
would
not
be
legal
unless
it
took
place
between
the
hours
of
eight
in
the
morning
and
three
in
the
afternoon
if
she
consented
to
this
the
emeralds
were
hers
once
more
is
the
proposal
of
a
madman
said
i
as
i
handed
back
the
letter
she
replied
with
a
nonchalant
shrug
of
her
shoulders
has
always
said
he
was
madly
in
love
with
me
and
i
quite
believe
it
poor
young
man
if
this
mummery
were
to
console
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
why
should
i
not
indulge
him
in
it
alicia
surely
you
would
not
countenance
the
profaning
of
that
lovely
old
edifice
with
a
mock
ceremonial
no
man
in
his
senses
could
suggest
such
a
thing
once
more
her
eyes
were
twinkling
with
merriment
the
honourable
john
haddon
as
i
have
told
you
is
not
in
his
senses
why
should
you
indulge
him
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
because
of
the
emeralds
it
is
only
a
mad
lark
after
all
and
no
one
need
know
of
it
oh
monsieur
valmont
she
cried
pleadingly
clasping
her
hands
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
with
an
undercurrent
of
laughter
in
her
beseeching
tones
you
not
enact
for
us
the
part
of
clergyman
i
am
sure
if
your
face
were
as
serious
as
it
is
at
this
moment
the
robes
of
a
priest
would
become
you
alicia
you
are
incorrigible
i
am
somewhat
of
a
man
of
the
world
yet
i
should
not
dare
to
counterfeit
the
sacred
office
and
i
hope
you
but
jest
in
fact
i
am
sure
you
do
my
lady
she
turned
away
from
me
with
a
very
pretty
pout
valmont
your
knighthood
is
after
all
but
surface
deep
is
not
mine
to
command
and
yours
to
obey
certainly
i
did
but
jest
john
shall
bring
his
own
imitation
clergyman
with
him
you
going
to
meet
him
tomorrow
i
am
i
have
promised
i
must
secure
my
necklace
seem
to
place
great
confidence
in
the
belief
that
he
will
produce
it
he
fails
to
do
so
then
i
play
monsieur
valmont
as
my
trump
card
but
monsieur
although
you
quite
rightly
refuse
to
comply
with
my
first
request
you
will
surely
not
reject
my
second
please
meet
me
tomorrow
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
promptly
at
a
seven
and
escort
me
to
the
church
for
a
moment
the
negative
trembled
on
my
tongue
end
but
she
turned
those
enchanting
eyes
upon
me
and
i
was
undone
well
i
answered
she
seized
both
my
hands
like
a
little
girl
overjoyed
at
a
promised
excursion
monsieur
valmont
you
are
a
darling
i
feel
as
if
i
known
you
all
my
life
i
am
sure
you
will
never
regret
having
humoured
me
then
added
a
moment
later
we
get
the
emeralds
said
i
we
get
the
emeralds
we
were
now
within
sight
of
the
house
and
she
pointed
out
our
rendezvous
for
the
following
day
and
with
that
i
bade
her
it
was
shortly
after
seven
next
morning
when
i
reached
the
the
lady
alicia
was
somewhat
long
in
coming
but
when
she
arrived
her
face
was
aglow
with
girlish
delight
at
the
solemn
prank
she
was
about
to
play
have
not
changed
your
mind
i
asked
after
the
greetings
no
monsieur
valmont
she
replied
with
a
bright
laugh
am
determined
to
recover
those
emeralds
must
hurry
lady
alicia
or
we
will
be
too
late
is
plenty
of
time
she
remarked
calmly
and
she
proved
to
be
right
because
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
church
the
clock
pointed
to
the
hour
of
seven
she
said
shall
wait
here
until
you
steal
up
to
the
church
and
look
in
through
one
of
the
windows
that
do
not
contain
stained
glass
i
should
not
for
the
world
arrive
before
haddon
and
his
friend
are
there
i
did
as
requested
and
saw
two
young
men
standing
together
in
the
centre
aisle
one
in
the
full
robes
of
a
clergyman
the
other
in
his
ordinary
dress
whom
i
took
to
be
the
honourable
john
haddon
his
profile
was
toward
me
and
i
must
admit
there
was
very
little
of
the
madman
in
his
calm
countenance
his
was
a
face
clean
shaven
and
strikingly
manly
in
one
of
the
pews
was
seated
a
woman
i
learned
afterwards
she
was
lady
alicia
maid
who
had
been
instructed
to
come
and
go
from
the
house
by
a
footpath
while
we
had
taken
the
longer
road
i
returned
and
escorted
lady
alicia
to
the
church
and
there
was
introduced
to
haddon
and
his
friend
the
divine
the
ceremony
was
at
once
performed
and
man
of
the
world
as
i
professed
myself
to
be
this
enacting
of
private
theatricals
in
a
church
grated
upon
me
when
the
maid
and
i
were
asked
to
sign
the
book
as
witnesses
i
said
this
is
carrying
realism
a
little
too
far
haddon
smiled
and
replied
am
amazed
to
hear
a
frenchman
objecting
to
realism
going
to
its
full
length
and
speaking
for
myself
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
the
autograph
of
the
renowned
eugène
valmont
and
with
that
he
proffered
me
the
pen
whereupon
i
scrawled
my
signature
the
maid
had
already
signed
and
disappeared
the
reputed
clergyman
bowed
us
out
of
the
church
standing
in
the
porch
to
see
us
walk
up
the
avenue
cried
john
haddon
i
be
back
within
half
an
hour
and
attend
to
the
clock
you
wo
mind
waiting
in
the
least
dear
boy
god
bless
you
both
and
the
tremor
in
his
voice
seemed
to
me
carrying
realism
one
step
further
still
the
lady
alicia
with
downcast
head
hurried
us
on
until
we
were
within
the
gloom
of
the
forest
and
then
ignoring
me
she
turned
suddenly
to
the
young
man
and
placed
her
two
hands
on
his
shoulders
jack
jack
she
cried
he
kissed
her
twice
on
the
lips
monsieur
valmont
insists
on
the
emeralds
the
young
man
laughed
her
ladyship
stood
fronting
him
with
her
back
towards
me
tenderly
the
young
man
unfastened
something
at
the
throat
of
that
dress
of
hers
then
there
was
a
snap
and
he
drew
out
an
amazing
dazzling
shimmering
sheen
of
green
that
seemed
to
turn
the
whole
bleak
december
landscape
verdant
as
with
a
touch
of
spring
the
girl
hid
her
rosy
face
against
him
and
over
her
shoulder
with
a
smile
he
handed
me
the
celebrated
blair
emeralds
is
the
treasure
valmont
he
cried
condition
that
you
do
not
molest
the
culprit
the
accessory
after
the
fact
gurgled
lady
alicia
in
smothered
tones
with
a
hand
clasping
together
her
dress
at
the
throat
trust
to
your
invention
valmont
to
deliver
that
necklace
to
uncle
with
a
detective
story
that
will
thrill
him
to
his
very
heart
we
heard
the
clock
strike
eight
then
a
second
later
smaller
bells
chimed
a
and
another
second
after
they
tinkled
the
cried
haddon
has
attended
to
the
clock
himself
what
a
good
fellow
he
is
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
minutes
to
nine
the
ceremony
genuine
then
i
asked
valmont
said
the
young
man
patting
his
wife
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
on
earth
can
be
more
genuine
than
that
ceremony
was
and
the
volatile
lady
alicia
snuggled
closer
to
him
appendix
two
sherlock
holmes
parodies
the
adventures
of
sherlaw
kombs
with
apologies
to
conan
doyle
and
his
excellent
book
study
in
scarlet
i
dropped
in
on
my
friend
sherlaw
kombs
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
pegram
mystery
as
it
had
come
to
be
called
in
the
newspapers
i
found
him
playing
the
violin
with
a
look
of
sweet
peace
and
serenity
on
his
face
which
i
never
noticed
on
the
countenances
of
those
within
hearing
distance
i
knew
this
expression
of
seraphic
calm
indicated
that
kombs
had
been
deeply
annoyed
about
something
such
indeed
proved
to
be
the
case
for
one
of
the
morning
papers
had
contained
an
article
eulogising
the
alertness
and
general
competence
of
scotland
yard
so
great
was
sherlaw
kombs
contempt
for
scotland
yard
that
he
never
would
visit
scotland
during
his
vacations
nor
would
he
ever
admit
that
a
scotchman
was
fit
for
anything
but
export
he
generously
put
away
his
violin
for
he
had
a
sincere
liking
for
me
and
greeted
me
with
his
usual
kindness
have
come
i
began
plunging
at
once
into
the
matter
on
my
mind
hear
what
you
think
of
the
great
pegram
mystery
have
heard
of
it
he
said
quietly
just
as
if
all
london
were
not
talking
of
that
very
thing
kombs
was
curiously
ignorant
on
some
subjects
and
abnormally
learned
on
others
i
found
for
instance
that
political
discussion
with
him
was
impossible
because
he
did
not
know
who
salisbury
and
gladstone
were
this
made
his
friendship
a
great
boon
pegram
mystery
has
baffled
even
gregory
of
scotland
yard
can
well
believe
it
said
my
friend
calmly
motion
or
squaring
the
circle
would
baffle
gregory
he
an
infant
is
gregory
this
was
one
of
the
things
i
always
liked
about
kombs
there
was
no
professional
jealousy
in
him
such
as
characterises
so
many
other
men
he
filled
his
pipe
threw
himself
into
his
armchair
placed
his
feet
on
the
mantel
and
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
me
about
it
he
said
simply
barrie
kipson
i
began
a
stockbroker
in
the
city
he
lived
in
pegram
and
it
was
his
custom
to
in
shouted
kombs
without
changing
his
position
but
with
a
suddenness
that
startled
me
i
had
heard
no
knock
me
said
my
friend
laughing
invitation
to
enter
was
a
trifle
premature
i
was
really
so
interested
in
your
recital
that
i
spoke
before
i
thought
which
a
detective
should
never
do
the
fact
is
a
man
will
be
here
in
a
moment
who
will
tell
me
all
about
this
crime
and
so
you
will
be
spared
further
effort
in
that
line
you
have
an
appointment
in
that
case
i
will
not
intrude
i
said
rising
down
i
have
no
appointment
i
did
not
know
until
i
spoke
that
he
was
coming
i
gazed
at
him
in
amazement
accustomed
as
i
was
to
his
extraordinary
talents
the
man
was
a
perpetual
surprise
to
me
he
continued
to
smoke
quietly
but
evidently
enjoyed
my
consternation
see
you
are
surprised
it
is
really
too
simple
to
talk
about
but
from
my
position
opposite
the
mirror
i
can
see
the
reflection
of
objects
in
the
street
a
man
stopped
looked
at
one
of
my
cards
and
then
glanced
across
the
street
i
recognised
my
card
because
as
you
know
they
are
all
in
scarlet
if
as
you
say
london
is
talking
of
this
mystery
it
naturally
follows
that
will
talk
of
it
and
the
chances
are
he
wished
to
consult
with
me
upon
it
anyone
can
see
that
besides
there
is
always
in
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
this
time
a
stranger
entered
sherlaw
kombs
did
not
change
his
lounging
attitude
wish
to
see
sherlaw
kombs
the
detective
said
the
stranger
coming
within
the
range
of
the
smoker
vision
is
kombs
i
remarked
at
last
as
my
friend
smoked
quietly
and
seemed
me
to
introduce
myself
continued
the
stranger
fumbling
for
a
card
is
no
need
you
are
a
journalist
said
kombs
said
the
stranger
somewhat
taken
aback
know
me
then
saw
or
heard
of
you
in
my
life
before
how
in
the
world
simpler
you
write
for
an
evening
paper
you
have
written
an
article
slating
the
book
of
a
friend
he
will
feel
badly
about
it
and
you
will
condole
with
him
he
will
never
know
who
stabbed
him
unless
i
tell
him
devil
cried
the
journalist
sinking
into
a
chair
and
mopping
his
brow
while
his
face
became
livid
drawled
kombs
is
a
devil
of
a
shame
that
such
things
are
done
but
what
would
you
as
we
say
in
france
when
the
journalist
had
recovered
his
second
wind
he
pulled
himself
together
somewhat
you
object
to
telling
me
how
you
know
these
particulars
about
a
man
you
say
you
have
never
seen
rarely
talk
about
these
things
said
kombs
with
great
composure
as
the
cultivation
of
the
habit
of
observation
may
help
you
in
your
profession
and
thus
in
a
remote
degree
benefit
me
by
making
your
paper
less
deadly
dull
i
will
tell
you
your
first
and
second
fingers
are
smeared
with
ink
which
shows
that
you
write
a
great
deal
this
smeared
class
embraces
two
clerks
or
accountants
and
journalists
clerks
have
to
be
neat
in
their
work
the
ink
smear
is
slight
in
their
case
your
fingers
are
badly
and
carelessly
smeared
therefore
you
are
a
journalist
you
have
an
evening
paper
in
your
pocket
anyone
might
have
any
evening
paper
but
yours
is
a
special
edition
which
will
not
be
on
the
streets
for
yet
you
must
have
obtained
it
before
you
left
the
office
and
to
do
this
you
must
be
on
the
staff
a
book
notice
is
marked
with
a
blue
pencil
a
journalist
always
despises
every
article
in
his
own
paper
not
written
by
himself
therefore
you
wrote
the
article
you
have
marked
and
doubtless
are
about
to
send
it
to
the
author
of
the
book
referred
to
your
paper
makes
a
speciality
of
abusing
all
books
not
written
by
some
member
of
its
own
staff
that
the
author
is
a
friend
of
yours
i
merely
surmised
it
is
all
a
trivial
example
of
ordinary
observation
kombs
you
are
the
most
wonderful
man
on
earth
you
are
the
equal
of
gregory
by
jove
you
are
a
frown
marred
the
brow
of
my
friend
as
he
placed
his
pipe
on
the
sideboard
and
drew
his
you
mean
to
insult
me
sir
do
not
i
i
assure
you
you
are
fit
to
take
charge
of
scotland
yard
tomorrow
i
am
in
earnest
indeed
i
am
sir
heaven
help
you
cried
kombs
slowly
raising
his
right
arm
i
sprang
between
them
shoot
i
cried
will
spoil
the
carpet
besides
sherlaw
do
you
see
the
man
means
well
he
actually
thinks
it
is
a
compliment
you
are
right
remarked
the
detective
flinging
his
revolver
carelessly
beside
his
pipe
much
to
the
relief
of
the
third
party
then
turning
to
the
journalist
he
said
with
his
customary
bland
courtesy
wanted
to
see
me
i
think
you
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
wilber
scribbings
the
journalist
started
do
you
know
my
name
he
gasped
kombs
waved
his
hand
impatiently
inside
your
hat
if
you
doubt
your
own
name
i
then
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
name
was
plainly
to
be
seen
inside
the
scribbings
held
upside
down
in
his
hands
have
heard
of
course
of
the
pegram
mystery
cried
the
detective
not
i
beg
of
you
call
it
a
mystery
there
is
no
such
thing
life
would
become
more
tolerable
if
there
ever
a
mystery
nothing
is
original
everything
has
been
done
before
what
about
the
pegram
affair
pegram
ah
case
has
baffled
everyone
the
wishes
you
to
investigate
so
that
it
may
publish
the
result
it
will
pay
you
well
will
you
accept
the
commission
tell
me
about
the
case
thought
everybody
knew
the
particulars
barrie
kipson
lived
at
pegram
he
carried
a
season
ticket
between
the
terminus
and
that
station
it
was
his
custom
to
leave
for
pegram
on
the
train
each
evening
some
weeks
ago
kipson
was
brought
down
by
the
influenza
on
his
first
visit
to
the
city
after
his
recovery
he
drew
something
like
in
notes
and
left
the
office
at
his
usual
hour
to
catch
the
he
was
never
seen
again
alive
as
far
as
the
public
have
been
able
to
learn
he
was
found
at
brewster
in
a
compartment
on
the
scotch
express
which
does
not
stop
between
london
and
brewster
there
was
a
bullet
in
his
head
and
his
money
was
gone
pointing
plainly
to
murder
and
robbery
where
is
the
mystery
might
i
ask
are
several
unexplainable
things
about
the
case
first
how
came
he
on
the
scotch
express
which
leaves
at
six
and
does
not
stop
at
pegram
second
the
ticket
examiners
at
the
terminus
would
have
turned
him
out
if
he
showed
his
season
ticket
and
all
the
tickets
sold
for
the
scotch
express
on
the
are
accounted
for
third
how
could
the
murderer
have
escaped
fourth
the
passengers
in
the
two
compartments
on
each
side
of
the
one
where
the
body
was
found
heard
no
scuffle
and
no
shot
fired
you
sure
the
scotch
express
on
the
did
not
stop
between
london
and
brewster
that
you
mention
the
fact
it
did
it
was
stopped
by
signal
just
outside
of
pegram
there
was
a
few
moments
pause
when
the
line
was
reported
clear
and
it
went
on
again
this
frequently
happens
as
there
is
a
branch
line
beyond
pegram
sherlaw
kombs
pondered
for
a
few
moments
smoking
his
pipe
silently
presume
you
wish
the
solution
in
time
for
tomorrow
paper
my
soul
no
the
editor
thought
if
you
evolved
a
theory
in
a
month
you
would
do
well
dear
sir
i
do
not
deal
with
theories
but
with
facts
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
call
here
tomorrow
at
i
will
give
you
the
full
particulars
early
enough
for
the
first
edition
there
is
no
sense
in
taking
up
much
time
over
so
simple
an
affair
as
the
pegram
case
good
afternoon
sir
scribbings
was
too
much
astonished
to
return
the
greeting
he
left
in
a
speechless
condition
and
i
saw
him
go
up
the
street
with
his
hat
still
in
his
hand
sherlaw
kombs
relapsed
into
his
old
lounging
attitude
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
the
smoke
came
from
his
lips
in
quick
puffs
at
first
then
at
longer
intervals
i
saw
he
was
coming
to
a
conclusion
so
i
said
nothing
finally
he
spoke
in
his
most
dreamy
manner
do
not
wish
to
seem
to
be
rushing
things
at
all
whatson
but
i
am
going
out
tonight
on
the
scotch
express
would
you
care
to
accompany
me
me
i
cried
glancing
at
the
clock
have
time
it
is
after
five
now
time
whatson
ample
he
murmured
without
changing
his
position
give
myself
a
minute
and
a
half
to
change
slippers
and
for
boots
and
coat
three
seconds
for
hat
seconds
to
the
street
seconds
waiting
for
a
hansom
and
then
seven
minutes
at
the
terminus
before
the
express
starts
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
i
was
only
too
happy
to
have
the
privilege
of
going
with
him
it
was
most
interesting
to
watch
the
workings
of
so
inscrutable
a
mind
as
we
drove
under
the
lofty
iron
roof
of
the
terminus
i
noticed
a
look
of
annoyance
pass
over
his
face
are
fifteen
seconds
ahead
of
our
time
he
remarked
looking
at
the
big
clock
dislike
having
a
miscalculation
of
that
sort
occur
the
great
scotch
express
stood
ready
for
its
long
journey
the
detective
tapped
one
of
the
guards
on
the
shoulder
have
heard
of
the
pegram
mystery
i
presume
sir
it
happened
on
this
very
train
sir
is
the
same
carriage
still
on
the
train
yes
sir
it
is
replied
the
guard
lowering
his
voice
of
course
sir
we
have
to
keep
very
quiet
about
it
people
travel
in
it
else
sir
do
you
happen
to
know
if
anybody
occupies
the
compartment
in
which
the
body
was
found
lady
and
gentleman
sir
i
put
in
myself
sir
you
further
oblige
me
said
the
detective
deftly
slipping
into
the
hand
of
the
guard
going
to
the
window
and
informing
them
in
an
offhand
casual
sort
of
way
that
the
tragedy
took
place
in
that
compartment
sir
we
followed
the
guard
and
the
moment
he
had
imparted
his
news
there
was
a
suppressed
scream
in
the
carriage
instantly
a
lady
came
out
followed
by
a
gentleman
who
scowled
at
the
guard
we
entered
the
now
empty
compartment
and
kombs
said
would
like
to
be
alone
here
until
we
reach
brewster
see
to
that
sir
answered
the
guard
locking
the
door
when
the
official
moved
away
i
asked
my
friend
what
he
expected
to
find
in
the
carriage
that
would
cast
any
light
on
the
case
was
his
brief
reply
why
do
you
come
to
corroborate
the
conclusions
i
have
already
arrived
at
might
i
ask
what
those
conclusions
are
replied
the
detective
with
a
touch
of
lassitude
in
his
voice
beg
to
call
your
attention
first
to
the
fact
that
this
train
stands
between
two
platforms
and
can
be
entered
from
either
side
any
man
familiar
with
the
station
for
years
would
be
aware
of
that
fact
this
shows
how
kipson
entered
the
train
just
before
it
started
the
door
on
this
side
is
locked
i
objected
trying
it
course
but
every
season
carries
a
key
this
accounts
for
the
guard
not
seeing
him
and
for
the
absence
of
a
ticket
now
let
me
give
you
some
information
about
the
influenza
the
patient
temperature
rises
several
degrees
above
normal
and
he
has
a
fever
when
the
malady
has
run
its
course
the
temperature
falls
to
of
a
degree
below
normal
these
facts
are
unknown
to
you
i
imagine
because
you
are
a
doctor
i
admitted
such
was
the
case
the
consequence
of
this
fall
in
temperature
is
that
the
convalescent
mind
turns
towards
thoughts
of
suicide
then
is
the
time
he
should
be
watched
by
his
friends
then
was
the
time
barrie
kipson
friends
did
watch
him
you
remember
the
of
course
no
it
was
a
most
depressing
day
fog
all
around
and
mud
under
foot
very
good
he
resolves
on
suicide
he
wishes
to
be
unidentified
if
possible
but
forgets
his
season
ticket
my
experience
is
that
a
man
about
to
commit
a
crime
always
forgets
something
how
do
you
account
for
the
disappearance
of
the
money
money
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
if
he
was
a
deep
man
and
knew
the
stupidness
of
scotland
yard
he
probably
sent
the
notes
to
an
enemy
if
not
they
may
have
been
given
to
a
friend
nothing
is
more
calculated
to
prepare
the
mind
for
than
the
prospect
of
a
night
ride
on
the
scotch
express
and
the
view
from
the
windows
of
the
train
as
it
passes
through
the
northern
part
of
london
is
particularly
conducive
to
thoughts
of
annihilation
became
of
the
weapon
is
just
the
point
on
which
i
wish
to
satisfy
myself
excuse
me
for
a
moment
sherlaw
kombs
drew
down
the
window
on
the
right
hand
side
and
examined
the
top
of
the
casing
minutely
with
a
magnifying
glass
presently
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
drew
up
the
sash
as
i
expected
he
remarked
speaking
more
to
himself
than
to
me
is
a
slight
dent
on
the
top
of
the
it
is
of
such
a
nature
as
to
be
made
only
by
the
trigger
of
a
pistol
falling
from
the
nerveless
hand
of
a
suicide
he
intended
to
throw
the
weapon
far
out
of
the
window
but
had
not
the
strength
it
might
have
fallen
into
the
carriage
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
bounced
away
from
the
line
and
lies
among
the
grass
about
ten
feet
six
inches
from
the
outside
rail
the
only
question
that
now
remains
is
where
the
deed
was
committed
and
the
exact
present
position
of
the
pistol
reckoned
in
miles
from
london
but
that
fortunately
is
too
simple
to
even
need
explanation
heavens
sherlaw
i
cried
can
you
call
that
simple
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
compute
we
were
now
flying
over
northern
london
and
the
great
detective
leaned
back
with
every
sign
of
closing
his
eyes
at
last
he
spoke
wearily
is
really
too
elementary
whatson
but
i
am
always
willing
to
oblige
a
friend
i
shall
be
relieved
however
when
you
are
able
to
work
out
the
abc
of
detection
for
yourself
although
i
shall
never
object
to
helping
you
with
the
words
of
more
than
three
syllables
having
made
up
his
mind
to
commit
suicide
kipson
naturally
intended
to
do
it
before
he
reached
brewster
because
tickets
are
again
examined
at
that
point
when
the
train
began
to
stop
at
the
signal
near
pegram
he
came
to
the
false
conclusion
that
it
was
stopping
at
brewster
the
fact
that
the
shot
was
not
heard
is
accounted
for
by
the
screech
of
the
added
to
the
noise
of
the
train
probably
the
whistle
was
also
sounding
at
the
same
moment
the
train
being
a
fast
express
would
stop
as
near
the
signal
as
possible
the
will
stop
a
train
in
twice
its
own
length
call
it
three
times
in
this
case
very
well
at
three
times
the
length
of
this
train
from
the
towards
london
deducting
half
the
length
of
the
train
as
this
carriage
is
in
the
middle
you
will
find
the
pistol
i
exclaimed
he
murmured
at
this
moment
the
whistle
sounded
shrilly
and
we
felt
the
grind
of
the
pegram
signal
again
cried
kombs
with
something
almost
like
enthusiasm
is
indeed
luck
we
will
get
out
here
whatson
and
test
the
matter
as
the
train
stopped
we
got
out
on
the
side
of
the
line
the
engine
stood
panting
impatiently
under
the
red
light
which
changed
to
green
as
i
looked
at
it
as
the
train
moved
on
with
increasing
speed
the
detective
counted
the
carriages
and
noted
down
the
number
it
was
now
dark
with
the
thin
crescent
of
the
moon
hanging
in
the
western
sky
throwing
a
weird
on
the
shining
metals
the
rear
lamps
of
the
train
disappeared
around
a
curve
and
the
signal
stood
at
baleful
red
again
the
black
magic
of
the
lonesome
night
in
that
strange
place
impressed
me
but
the
detective
was
a
most
practical
man
he
placed
his
back
against
the
and
paced
up
the
line
with
even
strides
counting
his
steps
i
walked
along
the
permanent
way
beside
him
silently
at
last
he
stopped
and
took
a
from
his
pocket
he
ran
it
out
until
the
ten
feet
six
inches
were
unrolled
scanning
the
figures
in
the
wan
light
of
the
new
moon
giving
me
the
end
he
placed
his
knuckles
on
the
metals
motioning
me
to
proceed
down
the
embankment
i
stretched
out
the
line
and
then
sank
my
hand
in
the
damp
grass
to
mark
the
spot
god
i
cried
aghast
is
this
is
the
pistol
said
kombs
quietly
it
was
journalistic
london
will
not
soon
forget
the
sensation
that
was
caused
by
the
record
of
the
investigations
of
sherlaw
kombs
as
printed
at
length
in
the
next
day
would
that
my
story
ended
here
alas
kombs
contemptuously
turned
over
the
pistol
to
scotland
yard
the
meddlesome
officials
actuated
as
i
always
hold
by
jealousy
found
the
name
of
the
seller
upon
it
they
investigated
the
seller
testified
that
it
had
never
been
in
the
possession
of
mr
kipson
as
far
as
he
knew
it
was
sold
to
a
man
whose
description
tallied
with
that
of
a
criminal
long
watched
by
the
police
he
was
arrested
and
turned
queen
evidence
in
the
hope
of
hanging
his
pal
it
seemed
that
kipson
who
was
a
gloomy
taciturn
man
and
usually
came
home
in
a
compartment
by
himself
thus
escaping
observation
had
been
murdered
in
the
lane
leading
to
his
house
after
robbing
him
the
miscreants
turned
their
thoughts
towards
the
disposal
of
the
body
a
subject
that
always
occupies
a
criminal
mind
before
the
deed
is
done
they
agreed
to
place
it
on
the
line
and
have
it
mangled
by
the
scotch
express
then
nearly
due
before
they
got
the
body
up
the
embankment
the
express
came
along
and
stopped
the
guard
got
out
and
walked
along
the
other
side
to
speak
with
the
engineer
the
thought
of
putting
the
body
into
an
empty
carriage
instantly
occurred
to
the
murderers
they
opened
the
door
with
the
deceased
key
it
is
supposed
that
the
pistol
dropped
when
they
were
hoisting
the
body
in
the
carriage
the
queen
evidence
dodge
did
work
and
scotland
yard
ignobly
insulted
my
friend
sherlaw
kombs
by
sending
him
a
pass
to
see
the
villains
hanged
the
adventure
of
the
second
swag
the
time
was
christmas
eve
the
place
was
an
ancient
secluded
manor
house
built
so
far
back
in
the
last
century
as
it
stood
at
the
head
of
a
profound
valley
a
valley
clothed
in
ferns
waist
deep
and
sombrely
guarded
by
ancient
trees
the
remnants
of
a
primeval
forest
from
this
mansion
no
other
human
habitation
could
be
seen
the
descending
road
which
connected
the
king
highway
with
the
stronghold
was
so
sinuous
and
precipitate
that
more
than
once
the
grim
baronet
who
owned
it
had
upset
his
automobile
in
trying
to
negotiate
the
dangerous
curves
the
isolated
situation
and
gloomy
architecture
of
this
venerable
mansion
must
have
impressed
the
most
casual
observer
with
the
thought
that
here
was
the
spot
for
the
perpetration
of
dark
deeds
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
place
was
brilliantly
illumined
with
electricity
while
the
silence
was
emphasised
rather
than
disturbed
by
the
monotonous
regular
thud
of
an
accumulator
pumping
the
subtle
fluid
into
a
receptive
dynamo
situated
in
an
outhouse
to
the
east
the
night
was
gloomy
and
lowering
after
a
day
of
rain
but
the
very
sombreness
of
the
scene
made
the
brilliant
stained
glass
windows
stand
out
like
the
radiant
covers
of
a
christmas
number
such
was
the
appearance
presented
by
the
home
of
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
situated
among
the
wilds
of
hindhead
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
from
london
is
it
any
wonder
that
at
a
spot
so
remote
from
civilisation
law
should
be
set
at
defiance
and
that
the
one
lone
policeman
who
perambulates
the
district
should
tremble
as
he
passed
the
sinister
gates
of
in
a
large
room
of
this
manor
house
furnished
with
a
luxuriant
elegance
one
would
not
have
expected
in
a
region
so
far
from
humanising
influences
sat
two
men
one
was
a
giant
in
stature
whose
broad
brow
and
smoothly
shaven
strong
chin
gave
a
look
of
determination
to
his
countenance
which
was
further
enhanced
by
the
heavy
black
moustache
which
covered
his
upper
lip
there
was
something
of
the
dragoon
in
his
upright
and
independent
bearing
he
had
in
fact
taken
part
in
more
than
one
fiercely
fought
battle
and
was
a
member
of
several
military
clubs
but
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
his
ancestors
had
used
war
clubs
and
had
transmitted
to
him
the
physique
of
a
hercules
one
did
not
need
to
glance
at
the
christmas
number
of
the
which
he
held
in
his
hand
nor
read
the
name
printed
there
in
large
letters
to
know
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
his
guest
an
older
man
yet
still
in
the
prime
of
life
whose
beard
was
tinged
with
grey
was
of
less
warlike
bearing
than
the
celebrated
novelist
belonging
as
he
evidently
did
to
the
civil
and
not
the
military
section
of
life
he
had
about
him
the
air
of
a
prosperous
man
of
affairs
shrewd
conciliatory
and
these
two
strongly
contrasting
personages
are
types
of
the
men
to
whom
england
owes
her
greatness
the
reader
of
the
christmas
number
will
very
probably
feel
disappointed
when
he
finds
as
he
supposes
merely
two
old
friends
sitting
amicably
in
a
country
house
after
dinner
there
seems
to
his
jaded
taste
no
element
of
tragedy
in
such
a
situation
these
two
men
appear
comfortable
enough
and
respectable
enough
it
is
true
that
there
is
whisky
and
soda
at
hand
and
the
box
of
cigars
is
open
yet
there
are
latent
possibilities
of
passion
under
the
most
placid
natures
revealed
only
to
writers
of
fiction
in
our
halfpenny
press
let
the
reader
wait
therefore
till
he
sees
these
two
men
tried
as
by
fire
under
a
great
temptation
and
then
let
him
say
whether
even
the
probity
of
sir
george
newnes
comes
scathless
from
the
ordeal
you
brought
the
swag
sir
george
asked
the
novelist
with
some
trace
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
replied
the
great
publisher
before
proceeding
to
the
count
would
it
not
be
wise
to
give
orders
that
will
insure
our
being
left
undisturbed
are
right
replied
doyle
pressing
an
electric
button
when
the
servant
appeared
he
said
am
not
at
home
to
anyone
no
matter
who
calls
or
what
excuse
is
given
you
must
permit
none
to
approach
this
room
when
the
servant
had
withdrawn
doyle
took
the
further
precaution
of
thrusting
in
place
one
of
the
huge
bolts
which
ornamented
the
massive
oaken
door
studded
with
iron
knobs
sir
george
withdrew
from
the
tail
pocket
of
his
dress
coat
two
canvas
bags
and
untying
the
strings
poured
the
rich
red
gold
on
the
smooth
table
think
you
will
find
that
right
he
said
thousand
pounds
in
all
the
writer
dragged
his
heavy
chair
nearer
the
table
and
began
to
count
the
coins
two
by
two
withdrawing
each
pair
from
the
pile
with
his
extended
forefingers
in
the
manner
of
one
accustomed
to
deal
with
great
treasure
for
a
time
the
silence
was
unbroken
save
by
the
chink
of
gold
when
suddenly
a
voice
outside
penetrated
even
the
stout
oak
of
the
huge
door
the
shrill
exclamation
seemed
to
touch
a
chord
of
remembrance
in
the
mind
of
sir
george
newnes
nervously
he
grasped
the
arms
of
his
chair
sitting
very
bolt
upright
muttering
it
be
he
of
all
persons
at
this
time
of
all
times
doyle
glanced
up
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
on
his
face
murmuring
to
keep
his
memory
green
hundred
and
ten
a
hundred
and
ten
a
hundred
and
ten
at
home
cried
the
vibrant
voice
everybody
is
at
home
on
christmas
eve
do
seem
to
be
he
heard
the
servant
reply
oh
i
have
no
home
merely
rooms
in
baker
street
i
must
see
your
master
and
at
once
left
in
his
motor
car
half
an
hour
ago
to
attend
the
county
ball
given
tonight
at
the
royal
huts
hotel
seven
miles
away
answered
the
servant
with
that
glib
mastery
of
fiction
which
unconsciously
comes
to
those
who
are
members
even
in
a
humble
capacity
of
a
household
devoted
to
the
production
of
imaginative
art
i
say
again
came
the
strident
voice
is
true
that
the
tracks
of
an
automobile
are
on
the
ground
in
front
of
your
door
but
if
you
will
notice
the
markings
of
the
belt
you
will
see
that
the
automobile
is
returning
and
not
departing
it
went
to
the
station
before
the
last
shower
to
bring
back
a
visitor
and
since
its
arrival
there
has
been
no
rain
that
suit
of
armour
in
the
hall
spattered
with
mud
shows
it
to
be
the
casing
the
visitor
wore
the
blazonry
upon
it
of
a
pair
of
scissors
above
an
open
book
resting
upon
a
printing
press
indicates
that
the
wearer
is
first
of
all
an
editor
second
a
publisher
and
third
a
printer
the
only
baronet
in
england
whose
occupation
corresponds
with
this
heraldic
device
is
sir
george
newnes
forget
sir
alfred
harmsworth
said
the
servant
whose
hand
held
a
copy
of
if
the
insistent
visitor
was
taken
aback
by
this
rejoinder
his
manner
showed
no
trace
of
embarrassment
and
he
went
on
unabashed
the
last
shower
began
at
ten
minutes
to
six
sir
george
must
have
arrived
at
haslemere
station
on
the
from
waterloo
he
has
had
dinner
and
at
this
moment
is
sitting
comfortably
with
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
doubtless
in
the
front
room
which
i
see
is
so
brilliantly
lighted
now
if
you
will
kindly
take
in
my
card
i
tell
you
persisted
the
perplexed
servant
the
master
left
in
his
motor
car
for
the
county
ball
at
the
royal
i
know
i
know
there
stands
his
suit
of
armour
too
newly
blackleaded
whose
coat
of
arms
is
a
couchant
typewriter
on
an
automobile
rampant
heavens
cried
sir
george
his
eyes
brightening
with
the
light
of
unholy
desire
have
material
enough
there
doyle
for
a
story
in
our
january
number
what
do
you
say
a
deep
frown
marred
the
smoothness
of
the
novelist
brow
say
he
replied
sternly
this
man
has
been
sending
threatening
letters
to
me
i
have
had
enough
of
his
menaces
triply
bolt
the
door
advised
newnes
with
a
sigh
of
disappointment
leaning
back
in
his
chair
you
take
me
for
a
man
who
bolts
when
his
enemy
appears
asked
doyle
fiercely
rising
to
his
feet
i
will
unbolt
he
shall
meet
the
douglas
in
his
hall
have
him
in
the
where
it
warm
suggested
sir
george
with
a
smile
diplomatically
desiring
to
pour
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
the
novelist
without
reply
spread
a
copy
of
that
over
the
pile
of
gold
strode
to
the
door
threw
it
open
and
said
coldly
the
gentleman
in
please
there
entered
to
them
a
tall
calm
man
with
face
eagle
eye
and
inquisitive
nose
although
the
visit
was
most
embarrassing
at
that
particular
juncture
the
natural
courtesy
of
the
novelist
restrained
him
from
giving
utterance
to
his
resentment
of
the
intrusion
and
he
proceeded
to
introduce
the
bidden
to
the
unbidden
guest
as
if
each
were
equally
welcome
sherlock
holmes
permit
me
to
present
to
you
sir
george
is
quite
superfluous
said
the
newcomer
in
an
even
voice
of
exasperating
tenor
i
perceive
at
once
that
one
who
wears
a
green
waistcoat
must
be
a
liberal
of
strong
home
rule
opinions
or
the
editor
of
several
publications
wearing
covers
of
emerald
hue
the
shamrock
necktie
in
addition
to
the
waistcoat
indicates
that
the
gentleman
before
me
is
both
and
so
i
take
it
for
granted
that
this
is
sir
george
newnes
how
is
your
circulation
sir
george
rising
replied
the
editor
am
glad
of
that
asserted
the
intruder
suavely
can
assure
you
that
the
temperature
outside
is
as
rapidly
falling
the
great
detective
spread
his
hands
before
the
glowing
electric
fire
and
rubbed
them
vigorously
together
perceive
through
that
evening
paper
the
sum
of
six
thousand
pounds
in
gold
doyle
interrupted
him
with
some
impatience
did
see
it
the
paper
you
saw
it
the
paper
goodness
knows
it
been
mentioned
in
enough
of
the
sheets
i
was
about
to
remark
went
on
sherlock
holmes
imperturbably
am
amazed
that
a
man
whose
time
is
so
valuable
should
waste
it
in
counting
the
money
you
are
surely
aware
that
a
golden
sovereign
weighs
grains
therefore
if
i
were
you
i
should
have
up
the
kitchen
scales
dump
in
the
metal
and
figure
out
the
amount
with
a
lead
pencil
you
brought
the
gold
in
two
canvas
bags
did
you
not
sir
george
the
name
of
all
that
wonderful
how
do
you
know
that
asked
the
astonished
publisher
sherlock
holmes
with
a
superior
smile
casually
waved
his
hand
toward
the
two
bags
which
still
lay
on
the
polished
table
i
tired
of
this
sort
of
thing
said
doyle
wearily
sitting
down
in
the
first
chair
that
presented
itself
you
be
honest
even
on
christmas
eve
you
know
the
oracles
of
old
did
not
try
it
on
with
each
other
is
true
said
sherlock
holmes
fact
is
i
followed
sir
george
newnes
into
the
capital
and
counties
bank
this
afternoon
where
he
demanded
six
thousand
pounds
in
gold
but
when
he
learned
this
would
weigh
pounds
seven
ounces
avoirdupois
weight
and
that
even
troy
weight
would
make
the
sum
no
lighter
he
took
two
small
bags
of
gold
and
the
rest
in
bank
of
england
notes
i
came
from
london
on
the
same
train
with
him
but
he
was
off
in
the
automobile
before
i
could
make
myself
known
and
so
i
had
to
walk
up
i
was
further
delayed
by
taking
the
wrong
turning
on
the
top
and
finding
myself
at
that
charming
spot
in
the
neighbourhood
where
a
sailor
was
murdered
by
two
ruffians
a
century
or
so
ago
there
was
a
note
of
warning
in
doyle
voice
when
he
said
that
incident
teach
you
no
lesson
did
you
not
realise
that
you
are
in
a
dangerous
locality
likely
to
fall
in
with
two
ruffians
asked
holmes
slightly
elevating
his
eyebrows
while
the
same
sweet
smile
hovered
round
his
thin
lips
the
remembrance
of
the
incident
encouraged
me
it
was
the
man
who
had
the
money
that
was
murdered
i
brought
no
coin
with
me
although
i
expect
to
bear
many
away
you
mind
telling
us
without
further
circumlocution
what
brings
you
here
so
late
at
night
sherlock
holmes
heaved
a
sigh
and
mournfully
shook
his
head
very
slowly
all
the
teaching
i
have
bestowed
upon
you
doyle
is
it
possible
that
you
can
not
deduct
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
that
why
am
i
here
because
sir
george
made
a
mistake
about
those
bags
he
was
quite
right
in
taking
one
of
them
to
but
he
should
have
left
the
other
at
baker
street
i
call
this
little
trip
adventure
of
the
second
swag
here
is
the
second
swag
on
the
table
the
first
swag
you
received
long
ago
and
all
i
had
for
my
share
was
some
honeyed
words
of
compliment
in
the
stories
you
wrote
now
it
is
truly
said
that
soft
words
butter
no
parsnips
and
in
this
instance
they
do
not
even
turn
away
wrath
so
far
as
the
second
swag
is
concerned
i
have
come
to
demand
half
of
it
am
not
so
poor
at
deduction
as
you
seem
to
imagine
said
doyle
apparently
nettled
at
the
other
slighting
reference
to
his
powers
was
well
aware
when
you
came
in
what
your
errand
was
i
deduced
further
that
if
you
saw
sir
george
withdraw
gold
from
the
bank
you
also
followed
him
to
waterloo
station
right
he
purchased
his
ticket
for
haslemere
you
did
the
same
did
you
arrived
at
haslemere
you
sent
a
telegram
to
your
friend
dr
watson
telling
him
of
your
whereabouts
are
wrong
there
i
ran
after
the
motor
car
certainly
sent
a
telegram
from
somewhere
to
someone
or
at
least
dropped
a
note
in
the
there
are
signs
which
i
need
not
mention
that
point
irrevocably
to
such
a
conclusion
the
doomed
man
ruined
by
his
own
merely
smiled
in
his
superior
manner
not
noticing
the
eager
look
with
which
doyle
awaited
his
answer
entirely
i
neither
wrote
any
telegram
nor
spoke
any
message
since
i
left
london
no
cried
doyle
see
where
i
went
astray
you
merely
inquired
the
way
to
my
house
needed
to
make
no
inquiries
i
followed
the
rear
light
of
the
automobile
part
way
up
the
hill
and
when
that
disappeared
i
turned
to
the
right
instead
of
the
left
as
there
was
no
one
out
on
such
a
night
from
whom
i
could
make
inquiry
deductions
then
are
beside
the
mark
said
doyle
hoarsely
in
an
accent
which
sent
cold
chills
up
and
down
the
spine
of
his
invited
guest
but
conveyed
no
intimation
of
his
fate
to
the
later
arrival
course
they
were
said
holmes
with
exasperating
i
also
wrong
in
deducting
that
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
you
left
london
you
are
quite
right
there
oblige
me
by
pressing
that
electric
button
holmes
did
so
with
much
eagerness
but
although
the
trio
waited
some
minutes
in
silence
there
was
no
response
deduct
from
that
said
doyle
the
servants
have
gone
to
bed
after
i
have
quite
satisfied
all
your
claims
in
the
way
of
hunger
for
food
and
gold
i
shall
take
you
back
in
my
motor
car
unless
you
prefer
to
stay
here
the
night
are
very
kind
said
sherlock
holmes
at
all
replied
doyle
take
that
chair
draw
it
up
to
the
table
and
we
will
divide
the
second
swag
the
chair
indicated
differed
from
all
others
in
the
room
it
was
and
its
oaken
arms
were
covered
by
two
plates
apparently
of
german
silver
when
holmes
clutched
it
by
the
arms
to
drag
it
forward
he
gave
one
gasp
and
plunged
headlong
to
the
floor
quivering
sir
george
newnes
sprang
up
standing
with
a
cry
of
alarm
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
remained
seated
a
seraphic
smile
of
infinite
satisfaction
playing
about
his
lips
he
fainted
cried
sir
george
merely
electrocuted
a
simple
device
the
sheriff
of
new
york
taught
me
when
i
was
over
there
last
heavens
can
not
he
be
resuscitated
dear
newnes
said
doyle
with
the
air
of
one
from
whose
shoulders
a
great
weight
is
lifted
man
may
fall
into
the
chasm
at
the
foot
of
the
reichenbach
fall
and
escape
to
record
his
adventures
later
but
when
two
thousand
volts
pass
through
the
human
frame
the
person
who
owns
that
frame
is
dead
do
mean
to
say
you
murdered
him
asked
sir
george
in
an
awed
whisper
the
term
you
use
is
harsh
still
it
rather
accurately
sums
up
the
situation
to
speak
candidly
sir
george
i
do
think
they
can
indite
us
for
anything
more
than
manslaughter
you
see
this
is
a
little
invention
for
the
reception
of
burglars
every
night
before
the
servants
go
to
bed
they
switch
on
the
current
to
this
chair
why
i
asked
holmes
to
press
the
button
i
place
a
small
table
beside
the
chair
and
put
on
it
a
bottle
of
wine
whisky
and
soda
and
cigars
then
if
any
burglar
comes
in
he
invariably
sits
down
in
the
chair
to
enjoy
himself
and
so
you
see
that
piece
of
furniture
is
an
effective
method
of
reducing
crime
the
number
of
burglars
i
have
turned
over
to
the
parish
to
be
buried
will
prove
that
this
taking
off
of
holmes
was
not
premeditated
by
me
this
incident
strictly
speaking
is
not
murder
but
manslaughter
we
should
get
more
than
fourteen
years
apiece
and
probably
that
would
be
cut
down
to
seven
on
the
ground
that
we
had
performed
an
act
for
the
public
benefit
cried
sir
george
what
have
i
had
to
do
with
it
my
dear
sir
everything
as
that
babbling
fool
talked
i
saw
in
your
eye
the
gleam
which
betokens
avarice
for
copy
indeed
i
think
you
mentioned
the
january
number
you
were
therefore
accessory
before
the
fact
i
simply
had
to
slaughter
the
poor
wretch
sir
george
sank
back
in
his
chair
wellnigh
breathless
with
horror
publishers
are
humane
men
who
rarely
commit
crimes
authors
however
are
a
hardened
set
who
usually
perpetrate
a
felony
every
time
they
issue
a
book
doyle
laughed
easily
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
how
i
killed
off
the
people
in
the
white
company
now
if
you
will
help
me
to
get
rid
of
the
body
all
may
yet
be
well
you
see
i
learned
from
the
misguided
simpleton
himself
that
nobody
knows
where
he
is
today
he
often
disappears
for
weeks
at
a
time
so
there
really
is
slight
danger
of
detection
will
you
lend
a
hand
suppose
i
must
cried
the
man
doyle
at
once
threw
off
the
lassitude
which
the
coming
of
sherlock
holmes
had
caused
and
acted
now
with
an
energy
which
was
characteristic
of
him
going
to
an
outhouse
he
brought
the
motor
car
to
the
front
door
then
picking
up
holmes
and
followed
by
his
trembling
guest
he
went
outside
and
flung
the
body
into
the
tonneau
behind
he
then
threw
a
spade
and
a
pick
into
the
car
and
covered
everything
up
with
a
spread
lighting
the
lamps
he
bade
his
silent
guest
get
up
beside
him
and
so
they
started
on
their
fateful
journey
taking
the
road
past
the
spot
where
the
sailor
had
been
murdered
and
dashing
down
the
long
hill
at
fearful
speed
toward
london
do
you
take
this
direction
asked
sir
george
it
be
more
advisable
to
go
further
into
the
country
doyle
laughed
harshly
you
a
place
on
wimbledon
common
why
not
bury
him
in
your
garden
motors
cried
the
horrified
man
can
you
propose
such
a
thing
talking
of
gardens
why
not
have
buried
him
in
your
own
which
was
infinitely
safer
than
going
forward
at
this
pace
no
fear
said
doyle
reassuringly
shall
find
him
a
suitable
sepulchre
without
disturbing
either
of
our
gardens
i
be
in
the
centre
of
london
within
two
hours
sir
george
stared
in
affright
at
the
demon
driver
the
man
had
evidently
gone
mad
to
london
of
all
places
in
the
world
surely
that
was
the
one
spot
on
earth
to
avoid
the
motor
and
let
me
off
he
cried
going
to
wake
up
the
nearest
magistrate
and
confess
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
doyle
you
see
that
no
person
on
earth
would
suspect
two
criminals
of
making
for
london
when
they
have
the
whole
country
before
them
have
you
read
my
stories
the
moment
a
man
commits
a
crime
he
tries
to
get
as
far
away
from
london
as
possible
every
policeman
knows
that
therefore
two
men
coming
into
london
are
innocent
strangers
according
to
scotland
yard
then
we
may
be
taken
up
for
fast
driving
and
think
of
the
terrible
burden
we
carry
safe
on
the
country
roads
and
i
slow
down
when
we
reach
the
suburbs
it
was
approaching
three
in
the
morning
when
a
huge
motor
car
turned
out
of
trafalgar
square
and
went
eastward
along
the
strand
the
northern
side
of
the
strand
was
up
as
it
usually
is
and
the
motor
skilfully
driven
glided
past
the
piles
of
blocks
great
sombre
kettles
holding
tar
and
the
general
of
a
convulsion
opposite
southampton
street
at
the
very
spot
so
graphically
illustrated
by
george
haité
on
the
cover
of
the
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
stopped
his
motor
the
strand
was
deserted
he
threw
pick
and
shovel
into
the
excavation
and
curtly
ordered
his
companion
to
take
his
choice
of
weapons
sir
george
selected
the
pick
and
doyle
vigorously
plied
the
spade
in
almost
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
a
very
respectable
hole
had
been
dug
and
in
it
was
placed
the
body
of
the
popular
private
detective
just
as
the
last
spadeful
was
shovelled
in
place
the
stern
voice
of
a
policeman
awoke
the
silence
and
caused
sir
george
to
drop
his
pick
from
nerveless
hands
are
you
two
doing
down
there
all
right
officer
said
doyle
glibly
as
one
who
had
foreseen
every
emergency
friend
here
is
controller
of
the
strand
when
the
strand
is
up
he
is
responsible
and
it
has
the
largest
circulation
in
the
i
mean
it
up
oftener
than
any
other
street
in
the
world
we
can
not
inspect
the
work
satisfactorily
while
traffic
is
on
and
so
we
have
been
examining
it
in
the
i
am
his
secretary
i
do
the
writing
you
know
i
see
replied
the
constable
gentlemen
good
morning
to
you
and
merry
christmas
same
to
you
constable
just
lend
a
hand
will
you
the
officer
of
the
law
helped
each
of
the
men
up
to
the
level
of
the
road
as
doyle
drove
away
from
the
spot
he
said
have
we
disposed
of
poor
holmes
in
the
busiest
spot
on
earth
where
no
one
will
ever
think
of
looking
for
him
and
we
put
him
away
without
even
a
christmas
box
around
him
we
have
buried
him
for
ever
in
the
