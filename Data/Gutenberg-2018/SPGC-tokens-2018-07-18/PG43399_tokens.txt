hugh
monroe
after
an
absence
of
many
years
i
have
returned
to
visit
for
a
time
my
blackfeet
relatives
and
friends
and
we
are
camping
along
the
mountain
trails
where
in
the
long
ago
we
hunted
buffalo
and
elk
and
moose
and
all
the
other
game
peculiar
to
this
region
we
pitched
our
lodges
under
rising
wolf
mountain
that
massive
height
of
rock
which
slopes
up
so
steeply
from
the
north
shore
of
upper
two
medicine
lake
this
afternoon
we
saw
upon
it
some
two
or
three
thousand
feet
up
toward
its
rugged
crest
a
few
bighorn
and
a
rocky
mountain
goat
but
we
may
not
kill
them
said
there
they
are
our
meat
but
the
whites
have
taken
them
from
us
even
as
they
have
taken
everything
else
that
is
ours
and
so
we
are
eating
beef
where
once
we
feasted
upon
the
rich
ribs
and
loins
of
game
which
tasted
all
the
better
because
we
trailed
and
killed
it
and
with
no
little
labor
brought
it
to
the
womenfolk
in
camp
rising
wolf
mountain
what
a
fitting
and
splendid
monument
it
is
to
the
first
white
man
to
traverse
the
foothills
of
the
rockies
between
the
saskatchewan
and
the
missouri
hugh
monroe
was
his
english
name
his
father
was
captain
hugh
monroe
of
the
english
army
his
mother
was
am√©lie
de
la
roche
a
daughter
of
a
noble
family
of
french
hugh
monroe
junior
was
born
in
montreal
in
in
he
received
permission
to
enter
the
employ
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
one
year
later
in
the
summer
of
he
arrived
at
its
new
post
mountain
fort
on
the
north
fork
of
the
saskatchewan
and
close
to
the
foothills
of
the
rockies
at
that
time
the
company
had
but
recently
entered
blackfeet
territory
and
none
of
its
understood
their
language
an
interpreter
was
needed
and
the
factor
appointed
monroe
to
fit
himself
for
the
position
the
blackfeet
were
leaving
the
fort
to
hunt
and
trap
along
the
tributaries
of
the
missouri
during
the
winter
and
he
went
with
them
under
the
protection
of
the
head
chief
who
had
nineteen
wives
and
two
lodges
and
an
immense
band
of
horses
by
easy
stages
they
traveled
along
the
foot
of
the
rockies
to
sun
river
where
they
wintered
and
then
in
the
spring
instead
of
returning
to
the
saskatchewan
they
crossed
the
missouri
hunted
in
the
yellowstone
country
that
summer
wintered
on
the
missouri
at
the
mouth
of
the
marias
river
and
returned
to
mountain
fort
the
following
spring
with
all
the
furs
their
horses
could
carry
instead
of
one
winter
monroe
had
passed
two
years
with
the
tribe
and
in
that
time
had
acquired
a
wife
a
daughter
of
the
great
chief
a
good
knowledge
of
the
language
and
an
honorable
name
rising
wolf
which
was
given
him
because
of
his
bravery
in
a
battle
with
the
crows
in
the
yellowstone
country
during
monroe
two
years
absence
from
the
fort
another
had
learned
the
blackfeet
language
from
a
cree
indian
who
spoke
it
well
so
that
this
man
became
the
interpreter
and
monroe
was
ordered
to
remain
with
the
piegan
tribe
of
the
blackfeet
to
travel
with
them
and
see
that
they
came
annually
to
the
fort
to
trade
in
the
winter
catch
of
furs
and
this
exactly
suited
him
he
much
preferred
roaming
the
plains
with
his
chosen
people
the
stuffy
rooms
of
the
fort
had
no
attractions
for
a
man
of
his
nature
how
i
envy
hugh
monroe
the
first
white
man
to
traverse
the
plains
lying
between
the
upper
saskatchewan
and
the
upper
missouri
and
the
first
to
see
many
portions
of
the
great
stretch
of
the
mountain
region
between
the
missouri
and
the
yellowstone
he
has
himself
often
told
me
that
every
day
of
that
life
was
a
day
of
great
joy
monroe
was
a
famous
hunter
and
trapper
and
a
warrior
as
well
he
was
a
member
of
the
or
seizer
band
of
the
all
friends
society
and
the
duty
of
the
seizers
was
to
keep
order
in
the
great
camp
and
see
that
the
people
obeyed
the
hunting
laws
a
most
difficult
task
at
times
on
several
occasions
he
went
with
his
and
other
bands
to
war
against
other
tribes
and
once
near
great
salt
lake
when
with
a
party
of
nearly
two
hundred
warriors
he
saved
the
lives
of
the
noted
jim
bridger
and
his
party
of
trappers
bridger
had
with
him
a
dozen
white
men
and
as
many
snake
indians
the
latter
bitter
enemies
of
the
blackfeet
the
snakes
were
discovered
and
the
blackfeet
party
was
preparing
to
charge
them
when
monroe
saw
that
there
were
white
men
behind
them
stop
white
men
are
with
them
we
must
let
them
go
their
way
in
peace
monroe
shouted
to
his
party
but
they
are
snake
white
men
and
therefore
our
enemy
we
shall
kill
them
all
the
blackfeet
chief
answered
however
such
was
power
over
his
comrades
that
he
finally
persuaded
them
to
remain
where
they
were
and
he
went
forward
with
a
flag
of
truce
and
found
that
his
friend
jim
bridger
was
the
leader
of
the
other
party
that
evening
white
men
and
snakes
and
blackfeet
ate
and
smoked
together
it
was
a
narrow
escape
for
bridger
and
his
handful
of
men
monroe
had
three
sons
and
three
daughters
by
his
indian
wife
all
of
whom
grew
into
fine
stalwart
men
and
women
up
and
down
the
country
he
roamed
with
them
trapping
and
hunting
and
often
fighting
hostile
war
parties
they
finally
all
married
and
in
his
old
age
he
lived
with
one
and
another
of
them
until
his
death
in
in
his
year
we
buried
him
near
the
buffalo
cliffs
down
on
the
two
medicine
river
where
he
had
seen
many
a
herd
of
the
huge
animals
decoyed
to
their
death
and
then
we
named
this
mountain
for
him
a
fitting
tribute
i
think
to
one
of
the
bravest
yet
most
kindly
men
of
the
old
old
west
at
the
upper
east
side
and
head
of
this
beautiful
lake
rises
a
pyramidal
mountain
of
great
height
and
grandeur
a
frowse
of
pine
timber
on
its
lower
front
slope
and
its
side
slopes
above
give
it
a
certain
resemblance
to
a
buffalo
bull
upon
looking
at
a
recent
map
of
the
country
i
found
that
it
had
been
named
mount
rockwell
so
turning
to
yellow
wolf
i
said
the
whites
have
given
that
mountain
yonder
the
name
of
a
white
man
it
is
so
marked
upon
this
paper
the
old
man
half
blind
and
quite
feeble
roused
up
when
he
heard
that
and
cried
out
is
it
so
not
satisfied
with
taking
our
mountains
the
whites
even
take
away
the
ancient
names
we
have
given
them
they
shall
not
do
it
you
tell
them
so
that
mountain
yonder
is
rising
bull
mountain
and
by
that
name
it
must
ever
be
called
rising
bull
was
one
of
our
great
chiefs
what
more
fitting
than
that
the
mountain
should
always
bear
his
name
rising
bull
was
a
chief
in
two
tribes
yellow
wolf
went
on
in
his
youth
he
married
a
flathead
girl
at
a
time
when
we
were
at
peace
with
that
people
and
after
a
winter
or
two
she
persuaded
him
to
take
her
across
the
mountains
for
a
visit
with
her
relatives
rising
bull
came
to
like
them
and
all
the
flathead
people
so
well
that
he
remained
with
them
a
number
of
winters
and
because
of
his
bravery
and
his
kind
and
generous
nature
the
flatheads
soon
appointed
him
one
of
their
chiefs
when
he
was
about
forty
winters
of
age
some
young
men
of
both
tribes
quarreled
over
a
gambling
game
and
several
were
killed
on
each
side
that
of
course
ended
the
peace
pact
war
was
declared
and
as
rising
bull
could
not
fight
his
own
people
he
came
back
to
us
with
his
flathead
wife
and
was
a
leader
in
the
war
which
lasted
for
several
years
when
that
was
ended
he
continued
to
lead
war
parties
against
the
crows
the
sioux
the
assiniboines
and
the
snakes
and
was
always
successful
came
the
dreadful
measles
winter
and
with
hundreds
of
our
people
he
died
he
left
a
son
white
quiver
a
very
brave
young
warrior
and
two
years
after
his
father
death
he
was
killed
in
a
raid
against
the
crows
the
winter
of
illustration
upper

lake
rising

mountain
on

ai
rising
bull
was
a
brave
man
and
oh
so
so
good
to
the
widows
and
orphans
to
all
in
any
kind
of
distress
we
must
in
some
way
see
that
this
mountain
continues
to
bear
his
name
said
and
to
that
i
most
heartily
agree
we
are
a
considerable
camp
of
people
yellow

my
old

or
and
with
them
they
have
their
eleven
women
and
fourteen
children
all
are
my
especial
friends
and
all
the
men
have
been
to
war
some
of
them
many
times
and
have
counted
upon
the
enemy
has
many
battle
scars
on
different
parts
of
his
body
i
was
with
him
when
he
got
the
last
one
in
a
fight
with
the
crees
the
bullet
struck
him
in
the
forehead
ripped
open
the
scalp
clear
to
the
back
of
his
head
but
did
not
penetrate
the
skull
he
dropped
instantly
when
struck
and
we
at
first
thought
that
he
was
dead
it
was
some
hours
before
he
regained
consciousness
with
all
these
men
and
especially
and
guardipe
i
hunted
and
traveled
much
in
the
old
days
naturally
we
spend
much
of
our
time
telling
over
of
our
adventures
meantime
the
children
play
around
as
happy
as
indian
children
ever
are
and
their
mothers
do
the
lodge
work
which
is
light
and
gather
in
groups
to
chat
and
joke
the
boys
have
just
been
skipping
stones
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
lake
the
number
of
skips
a
stone
makes
before
it
finally
sinks
denotes
the
number
of
wives
the
caster
will
have
when
he
reaches
manhood
and
two
guns
are
medicine
men
the
former
has
the
elk
medicine
pipe
the
latter
the
water
medicine
pipe
both
ancient
medicines
in
the
tribe
they
are
spiritual
not
material
medicines
in
fact
they
are
the
implements
used
in
prayers
to
the
sun
and
other
gods
and
each
carries
with
it
a
ritual
of
its
own
has
just
told
me
that
we
will
have
some
prayers
with
his
pipe
a
few
days
from
now
i
shall
be
glad
to
take
part
in
it
all
once
more
again
my
people
are
filled
with
resentment
against
the
whites
i
told
them
this
afternoon
that
the
falls
in
the
river
between
this
and
the
lower
lake
had
been
given
a
foolish
white
men
name
i
could
not
tell
them
what
it
was
for
there
is
no
blackfeet
equivalent
for
the
word
trick
but
what
a
miserable
name
that
is
to
give
to
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
waterfalls
and
the
only
one
of
its
kind
in
america
and
in
all
the
world
for
all
i
know
a
short
distance
below
the
outlet
of
the
upper
lake
the
river
sinks
and
a
farther
on
gushes
into
sight
from
a
jagged
hole
halfway
up
the
side
of
a
high
and
almost
perpendicular
cliff
in
the
long
ago
we
named
that
falls
said
yes
and
who
was
he
i
asked
although
i
had
a
fair
recollection
of
the
story
of
that
personage
but
i
had
forgotten
the
details
of
it
and
wanted
them
all
not
he
but
she
he
corrected
me
but
running
eagle
is
a
man
name
i
objected
true
but
this
woman
earned
the
right
to
bear
a
man
name
and
so
it
was
given
her
she
was
the
only
woman
of
our
people
to
receive
that
honor
so
far
as
i
know
listen
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
the
woman
who
earned
a
man
name
as
a
girl
her
name
was
weasel
woman
she
was
the
eldest
of
two
brothers
and
two
sisters
and
when
she
had
seen
fifteen
winters
both
their
father
and
mother
died
but
unlike
children
in
such
circumstances
they
did
not
give
up
their
lodge
and
scatter
out
to
live
with
relatives
and
friends
said
weasel
woman
some
way
we
can
manage
to
live
you
boys
are
old
enough
to
hunt
and
bring
in
meat
and
skins
we
three
sisters
will
keep
the
lodge
in
good
order
and
tan
the
skins
for
our
clothing
and
bedding
and
other
uses
and
as
she
said
so
it
was
done
and
the
orphan
family
prospered
illustration
running
eagle
falls
the
greater
part
of
the
stream
gushes
from
the
orifice
a
third
of
the
way
up
the
cliff
but
weasel
woman
was
not
satisfied
many
young
men
and
many
old
and
rich
men
wanted
to
marry
her
and
to
all
she
said
so
loudly
and
so
quickly
that
after
a
time
all
knew
that
she
would
not
marry
wherever
a
party
of
warriors
gathered
for
a
dance
or
a
feast
there
she
was
looking
on
listening
to
their
talk
and
giving
what
help
she
could
and
when
a
party
returned
from
war
she
was
loudest
in
praising
them
all
she
talked
of
all
she
thought
about
was
war
on
an
evening
in
her
twentieth
summer
a
large
party
of
warriors
started
out
to
cross
the
mountains
and
raid
the
flatheads
they
traveled
all
night
and
when
daylight
came
found
that
weasel
woman
was
with
them
back
go
home
the
war
chief
told
her
but
she
would
not
listen
you
will
not
let
me
go
with
you
i
shall
follow
you
she
said
and
then
spoke
up
the
medicine
man
of
the
party
said
he
advise
you
to
allow
her
to
go
with
us
something
tells
me
that
she
will
bring
us
good
luck
as
you
advise
me
so
shall
it
be
said
the
war
chief
and
the
woman
went
on
with
them
no
man
of
that
party
teased
her
nor
bothered
her
in
any
way
every
one
of
them
treated
her
as
they
would
a
sister
it
was
the
strangest
war
party
that
ever
set
forth
from
any
tribe
of
the
plains
it
was
at
the
edge
of
flathead
lake
that
they
discovered
the
enemy
a
large
camp
of
the
flatheads
and
their
friends
the
pend
when
night
came
they
went
close
up
to
it
and
the
woman
said
to
the
war
chief
me
go
in
first
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
i
feel
that
i
shall
be
successful
in
there
the
chief
told
her
we
will
wait
for
you
here
and
be
ready
to
help
you
if
you
get
into
trouble
the
woman
went
into
the
camp
where
all
the
best
horses
of
the
people
their
fast
buffalo
runners
their
racers
and
their
stallions
were
picketed
close
to
the
lodges
of
the
different
owners
of
them
if
she
was
afraid
of
being
discovered
and
killed
she
never
admitted
it
the
dying
moon
gave
light
enough
for
her
to
see
the
size
and
color
of
the
horses
she
took
her
time
and
went
around
among
them
and
making
her
choice
cut
the
ropes
of
three
fine
pinto
horses
and
led
them
out
to
where
the
party
awaited
her
there
she
tied
them
and
went
back
into
camp
with
the
chief
and
his
men
and
again
came
out
with
three
horses
said
she
then
have
taken
enough
for
this
time
i
will
await
you
here
and
take
care
of
what
we
have
the
men
went
back
several
times
and
then
having
all
the
horses
that
they
could
drive
rapidly
the
party
struck
for
the
mountains
and
in
several
days
time
arrived
home
without
the
loss
of
a
man
or
a
horse
a
few
days
after
the
party
came
into
camp
the
medicine
lodge
was
put
up
and
on
the
day
that
the
warriors
counted
their
and
new
names
were
given
them
an
old
warrior
and
medicine
man
called
weasel
woman
before
the
people
and
had
her
count
her
of
going
twice
into
the
enemy
camp
and
taking
six
horses
all
shouted
approval
of
that
and
then
the
medicine
man
gave
her
the
name
a
very
great
one
that
of
a
chief
whose
shadow
had
some
time
before
gone
on
to
the
sand
hills
after
that
as
we
now
may
call
her
did
not
have
to
sneak
after
a
party
in
order
to
go
to
war
with
them
she
was
asked
to
go
and
after
two
or
three
more
successful
raids
against
different
enemies
the
crows
the
sioux
and
the
flatheads
she
herself
became
a
war
chief
and
warriors
begged
to
be
allowed
to
join
her
parties
because
they
believed
that
where
she
led
nothing
but
good
luck
would
come
to
them
she
now
wore
men
clothing
when
on
a
raid
at
home
she
wore
her
woman
clothing
but
even
in
that
dress
she
like
any
man
gave
feasts
and
dances
and
the
greatest
chiefs
and
warriors
came
to
them
and
were
glad
to
be
there
on
her
sixth
raid
led
a
large
war
party
against
the
flatheads
and
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
fell
in
with
a
war
party
of
bloods
one
of
our
brother
tribes
of
the
north
for
several
days
the
two
parties
traveled
along
together
and
then
one
evening
the
blood
chief
falling
bear
said
to
servant
tell
your
chief
woman
that
i
would
like
to
marry
her
you
do
not
understand
the
boy
told
him
is
not
that
kind
men
are
her
brothers
and
nothing
more
she
will
never
marry
i
can
not
give
her
your
message
for
i
am
afraid
that
she
would
be
angry
with
me
for
carrying
it
to
her
on
the
next
day
as
they
were
traveling
along
the
blood
chief
said
to
have
never
loved
but
i
love
now
i
love
you
my
heart
is
all
yours
let
us
marry
will
not
say
yes
to
that
nor
will
i
say
no
the
woman
chief
answered
him
will
consider
what
you
ask
and
give
you
an
answer
after
we
make
this
raid
and
with
that
the
blood
chief
said
no
more
but
felt
encouraged
he
thought
that
in
time
she
would
agree
to
become
his
woman
that
very
evening
the
scouts
ahead
discovered
a
large
camp
of
flathead
and
kootenai
indians
more
than
a
hundred
lodges
of
them
and
when
night
came
both
parties
drew
close
in
to
it
then
ordered
her
followers
to
remain
where
they
were
and
told
the
blood
chief
to
say
the
same
thing
to
his
men
she
then
told
the
blood
chief
to
go
into
the
camp
and
take
horses
and
he
went
in
and
returned
with
one
horse
is
now
my
turn
said
and
she
went
in
and
brought
out
two
horses
the
blood
chief
went
in
and
brought
out
two
horses
went
in
and
brought
out
four
horses
the
blood
chief
went
in
and
brought
out
two
horses
went
in
and
brought
out
one
horse
and
then
she
said
to
the
blood
chief
men
are
becoming
impatient
to
go
in
there
and
take
horses
we
will
each
of
us
go
in
once
more
and
then
let
them
do
what
they
can
so
the
blood
chief
went
in
for
the
fourth
and
last
time
and
came
back
leading
four
horses
making
nine
in
all
and
then
went
in
and
cut
the
ropes
of
eight
horses
and
safely
led
them
out
making
in
all
fifteen
that
she
had
taken
the
warriors
then
went
in
making
several
trips
and
then
with
all
the
horses
that
could
be
easily
driven
the
big
double
party
headed
for
home
on
the
next
day
as
and
the
blood
chief
were
riding
together
he
said
to
her
love
you
so
much
that
i
can
wait
no
longer
for
my
answer
give
it
to
me
now
i
believe
that
you
are
going
to
say
yes
i
will
be
your
woman
said
gave
you
your
chance
it
would
have
been
yes
had
you
taken
more
horses
than
i
did
from
the
camp
of
the
enemy
but
i
took
the
most
therefore
i
can
not
marry
you
that
was
her
way
of
getting
around
saying
to
the
chief
she
had
beaten
him
an
old
experienced
warrior
in
the
taking
of
the
horses
and
he
could
not
ask
her
again
to
become
his
woman
it
is
said
that
he
felt
very
badly
about
it
all
now
carried
a
gun
when
she
went
to
war
and
used
it
well
in
several
fights
with
the
enemy
counting
in
all
three
each
one
of
them
the
taking
of
a
gun
from
the
man
she
herself
killed
and
then
on
her
ninth
raid
she
led
a
party
against
the
flatheads
and
while
she
and
all
her
men
were
in
the
camp
choosing
horses
and
cutting
their
ropes
the
flatheads
discovered
them
and
began
firing
and
she
and
five
of
her
men
were
killed
and
so
passed
virgin
and
brave
woman
chief
of
our
people
she
died
young
about
seventy
winters
ago
okan
his
vision
is
the
name
the
blackfeet
have
for
the
great
lodge
which
they
annually
give
to
the
sun
and
for
the
four
days
of
ceremonies
attending
its
erection
and
consecration
in
our
vernacular
it
is
the
medicine
lodge
i
asked
yellow
wolf
this
afternoon
why
this
river
was
named
or
as
we
say
two
medicine
lodge
river
and
he
replied
that
when
the
blackfeet
first
took
this
great
country
from
the
crows
they
built
a
medicine
lodge
on
the
river
just
below
the
buffalo
cliffs
the
next
summer
they
built
another
one
in
the
same
place
and
owing
to
that
the
river
got
its
name
illustration
at
upper
two
medicine
lake
left
to
right
yellow
wolf
and
the
author
relating
his
killing
of
a
grizzly
at
this
particular
place
in
the
yes
this
was
once
the
country
of
the
crows
but
the
blackfeet
saw
and
coveted
it
it
was
about
two
hundred
years
ago
as
near
as
i
can
learn
that
they
came
into
it
from
their
original
home
the
region
of
peace
river
and
the
slave
lakes
and
little
by
little
forced
the
crows
southward
until
they
had
driven
them
to
the
south
side
of
the
yellowstone
or
elk
river
as
it
is
known
to
the
various
indian
tribes
of
the
plains
perhaps
in
the
first
place
the
blackfeet
coveted
more
than
anything
else
the
cliffs
on
the
two
medicine
just
above
holy
family
mission
where
the
buffalo
were
decoyed
in
great
numbers
and
stampeded
in
a
huge
waterfall
of
whirling
brown
bodies
to
death
on
the
rocks
below
the
blackfeet
call
such
a
place
there
were
several
of
them
a
a
trap
extending
back
from
the
cliff
for
a
mile
or
more
out
on
the
plain
were
two
lines
of
rock
piles
like
a
huge
letter
behind
these
the
people
concealed
themselves
and
the
buffalo
caller
going
out
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
v
by
certain
antics
and
motions
aroused
the
curiosity
of
the
herd
until
it
finally
followed
him
into
the
then
the
people
began
to
rise
up
behind
it
and
the
result
was
that
unable
to
turn
either
to
the
right
or
left
from
fear
of
the
two
lines
of
shouting
stampeders
it
was
driven
straight
to
the
cliff
and
over
it
when
i
first
saw
the
place
there
were
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
tons
and
tons
of
buffalo
horn
tips
the
most
of
any
portion
of
a
buffalo
anatomy
last
night
while
the
pipe
was
going
the
rounds
i
asked
what
had
become
of
old
red
eagle
thunder
medicine
pipe
and
was
told
that
it
was
still
in
the
tribe
old
person
at
present
being
the
owner
of
it
said
two
guns
that
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
most
powerful
medicines
we
have
do
you
know
how
it
came
into
our
possession
the
story
of
the
thunder
medicine
it
was
in
the
long
ago
our
fathers
had
no
horses
then
but
used
dogs
to
carry
their
belongings
one
spring
needing
the
skins
of
bighorn
to
tan
into
soft
leather
for
clothing
the
tribe
moved
up
here
to
the
foot
of
the
lower
two
medicine
lake
and
began
hunting
many
men
would
surround
and
climb
a
mountain
driving
the
bighorn
ahead
of
them
their
dogs
helping
and
at
last
they
would
come
up
to
the
game
often
several
hundred
head
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
dogs
were
then
held
back
and
the
hunters
advancing
with
ready
bow
and
arrows
would
shoot
and
shoot
the
bighorn
at
close
range
and
generally
kill
the
most
of
them
one
day
while
most
of
the
men
were
hunting
three
young
unmarried
women
went
out
to
gather
wood
and
while
they
were
collecting
it
in
little
piles
here
and
there
a
thunderstorm
came
up
then
said
one
of
them
a
beautiful
girl
tall
slender
thunder
i
am
pure
i
am
a
virgin
if
you
will
not
strike
us
i
promise
to
marry
you
whenever
you
want
me
thunder
passed
on
not
harming
them
and
the
young
women
gathered
up
their
firewood
and
went
home
on
another
day
these
three
young
women
went
out
again
for
firewood
one
ahead
of
another
along
the
trail
in
the
deep
woods
and
mink
woman
she
who
had
promised
herself
to
thunder
man
was
last
of
the
three
she
was
some
distance
behind
the
others
and
singing
happily
as
she
stepped
along
when
out
from
the
brush
in
front
of
her
stepped
a
very
beautifully
dressed
man
and
said
here
i
am
i
have
come
for
you
not
for
me
you
are
mistaken
i
am
not
that
kind
i
am
a
pure
woman
she
answered
you
ca
go
back
on
your
word
you
promised
yourself
to
me
if
i
would
not
strike
you
and
i
did
not
harm
you
do
you
know
me
i
am
thunder
man
mink
woman
looked
closely
at
him
and
her
heart
beat
fast
from
fear
but
he
was
good
to
look
at
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
kind
and
gentle
man
and
although
thoughtlessly
she
had
made
a
promise
to
him
a
god
and
she
could
not
break
it
so
she
answered
said
that
i
would
marry
you
well
here
i
am
take
me
her
two
companions
had
passed
on
they
saw
nothing
of
this
meeting
thunder
man
stepped
forward
and
kissed
her
then
took
her
in
his
arms
and
springing
from
the
ground
carried
her
up
into
the
sky
to
the
land
of
the
above
people
but
the
two
young
women
soon
missed
her
they
ran
back
on
the
trail
and
searched
on
all
sides
of
it
and
called
and
called
to
her
and
of
course
got
no
reply
may
have
gone
home
for
something
said
one
of
them
and
they
hurried
back
to
camp
she
was
not
there
they
then
gave
the
alarm
and
all
the
people
scattered
out
to
look
for
her
they
hunted
all
that
day
and
wandered
about
in
the
woods
all
night
calling
her
name
and
got
no
answer
the
next
morning
mink
woman

man
went
to
the
two
young
women
and
got
them
to
show
him
where
they
had
last
seen

woman
he
then
called
a
magpie
to
him
and
said
to
the
bird
around
here
and
find
this
missing
trail
the
bird
flew
around
and
around
crow
man
following
it
and
at
last
it
fluttered
to
the
ground
and
looked
up
at
him
and
said
this
spot
where
i
stand
came
the
woman
and
here
her
trail
ends
it
so
crow
man
exclaimed

just
where
you
are
and
move
that
long
shining
black
tail
of
yours

it
up
and
down
and
sideways
twist
it
in
every
direction
that
you
can
the
magpie
did
as
he
was
told
and
crow
man
got
down
on
hands
and
knees
and
went
around
watching
the
shifting
wiggling
fanning
tail
suddenly
he
cried
out
hold
your
tail
motionless
in
just
that
position
and
he
moved
up
nearer
and
looked
more
closely
at
it
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
upon
it
and
the
glistening
black
feathers
mirrored
everything
around
they
were
now
spread
directly
behind
the
bird
body
and
reflected
the
and
the
sky
beyond
them
long
long
crow
man
stared
at
the
tail
the
people
looking
on
and
holding
their
breath
and
at
last
he
said
to
lame
bull
can
see
your
daughter
but
she
is
beyond
my
reach
i
can
not
fly
there
she
is
up
in
sky
land
and
thunder
man
has
her
ai
she
did
promise
herself
to
him
the
other
day
if
he
would
spare
us
one
of
the
two
wood
gatherers
said
she
did
not
mean
it
she
was
only
joking
it
is
no
joke
lame
bull
sat
down
and
covered
his
head
with
his
robe
and
wept
and
would
not
be
comforted
thunder
man
took
mink
woman
to
sky
land
with
him
and
somehow
from
the
very
first
she
was
happy
there
with
him
she
seemed
to
forget
at
once
all
about
this
earth
and
her
parents
and
the
people
it
was
a
beautiful
land
up
there
warm
and
sunny
a
country
just
like
ours
except
that
it
had
no
storms
buffalo
and
all
the
other
animals
covered
the
plains
and
all
sorts
of
grasses
and
trees
and
and
plants
grew
there
as
they
do
here
but
although
mink
woman
was
very
happy
there
thunder
man
was
always
uneasy
about
her
and
kept
saying
to
his
people
her
constantly
see
that
she
gets
no
hint
of
her
country
down
below
nor
sight
of
it
if
she
does
then
she
will
cry
and
cry
and
become
sick
and
that
will
be
bad
for
me
thunder
man
was
often
away
and
during
his
absence
his
people
kept
a
good
watch
on
mink
woman
and
did
all
they
could
to
amuse
her
to
keep
her
interested
in
different
things
one
day
a
woman
gave
her
some
freshly
dug
and
she
cried
out
how
good
of
you
to
give
me
these
i
must
go
dig
some
for
myself
i
know
not
the
english
name
for
this
edible
root
the
french
voyageurs
name
for
it
was
no
do
go
we
will
dig
for
you
all
that
you
can
use
the
women
told
her
but
she
would
not
listen
want
the
fun
of
digging
them
for
myself
she
told
them
some
time
back
i
did
dig
them
i
must
dig
them
again
if
you
must
you
must
they
answered
and
gave
her
a
digging
stick
and
cautioned
her
not
to
dig
a
very
large
one
should
she
find
it
for
that
was
the
mother
of
all
the
others
and
was
constantly
bringing
forth
new
ones
by
scattering
her
seed
to
the
winds
she
promised
that
she
would
not
touch
it
and
went
off
happily
with
her
digging
stick
and
a
sack
well
mink
woman
wandered
about
on
the
warm
grass
and
plain
digging
a
here
one
there
singing
to
herself
and
thinking
how
much
she
loved
her
thunder
man
and
wishing
that
he
would
be
more
often
at
home
he
was
away
the
greater
part
of
the
time
thus
wandering
in
a
low
place
in
the
plain
she
came
upon
a
of
enormous
size
actually
it
was
larger
around
than
her
body
this
is
the
mother
the
one
they
told
me
not
to
dig
up
she
cried
and
walked
around
and
around
it
admiring
its
hugeness
would
like
to
dig
it
but
i
must
not
she
at
last
said
to
herself
and
went
on
seeking
more
of
small
size
but
she
could
not
forget
the
big
one
she
kept
imagining
how
it
would
look
out
of
the
ground
on
her
back
in
her
lodge
all
nicely
cleaned
and
washed
a
present
for
thunder
man
when
he
should
return
home
she
went
back
to
it
walked
around
it
many
times
went
away
from
it
trying
to
do
as
she
had
been
told
but
when
halfway
home
she
could
no
longer
resist
the
temptation
with
a
little
cry
she
turned
and
never
stopped
running
until
she
was
beside
it
and
then
she
used
the
digging
stick
with
all
her
strength
thrusting
it
into
the
ground
around
and
around
and
around
the
huge
growth
and
prying
up
and
at
last
it
became
loose
and
seizing
it
by
its
big
top
leaves
she
pulled
hard
and
tore
it
from
the
ground
and
rolled
it
to
one
side
of
the
hole
what
a
big
hole
it
was
and
light
seemed
to
come
up
through
it
she
stepped
to
the
edge
and
looked
down
upon
pulling
up
the
huge
she
had
torn
a
hole
clear
through
the
sky
earth
she
stooped
and
looked
through
it
and
there
far
far
below
saw
why
everything
came
back
to
her
when
she
looked
through
it
there
it
was
her
own
earth
land
there
was
the
two
medicine
river
and
there
just
below
the
foot
of
its
lower
lake
was
the
camp
of
her
people
she
threw
away
her
digging
stick
and
her
sack
of
and
ran
crying
to
camp
and
into
thunder
man
lodge
he
was
away
at
the
time
but
some
of
his
relatives
were
in
the
lodge
and
she
cried
out
to
them
have
seen
my
own
country
the
camp
of
my
people
i
want
to
go
back
to
them
said
thunder
man
relatives
to
one
another
has
found
the
big
and
has
pulled
it
up
and
made
a
hole
in
our
sky
earth
now
what
shall
we
do
thunder
man
will
be
angry
at
us
because
we
did
not
watch
her
more
closely
thinking
of
what
he
might
do
to
them
in
his
anger
they
trembled
they
tried
to
soothe
mink
woman
but
she
would
not
be
comforted
she
kept
crying
and
crying
to
be
taken
back
to
her
father
and
mother
thunder
man
came
home
in
the
evening
and
upon
learning
what
had
happened
his
distress
was
as
great
as
that
of
mink
woman
whom
he
loved
when
he
came
into
the
lodge
she
threw
herself
upon
him
and
with
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
begged
him
to
take
her
back
to
her
people
do
you
love
me
he
asked
you
been
happy
here
is
this
a
beautiful
a
rich
country
course
i
love
you
i
have
been
happy
here
this
is
a
good
country
but
oh
i
want
to
see
my
father
and
mother
sleep
now
in
the
morning
you
will
likely
feel
that
you
are
glad
to
be
here
instead
of
down
on
the
people
earth
thunder
man
told
her
but
she
would
not
sleep
she
cried
all
night
would
not
eat
in
the
morning
and
kept
on
crying
for
her
people
then
said
thunder
man
can
not
bear
to
see
to
hear
such
distress
because
i
love
her
she
shall
have
her
way
go
you
hunters
kill
buffalo

many
of
them
and
bring
in
the
hides
and
you
all
you
women
take
the
hides
and
cut
them
into
long
strong
strips
and
tie
them
together
this
the
hunters
and
the
women
did
and
thunder
man
himself
made
a
long
basket
of
a
buffalo
bull
hide
and
willow
sticks
this
and
the
long
long
rope
of
buffalo
hide
were
taken
to
the
hole
that
mink
woman
had
torn
in
the
sky
earth
and
then
thunder
man
brought
her
to
the
place
and
laid
her
carefully
in
the
basket
which
he
had
lined
with
soft
robes
i
love
you
so
dearly
i
am
going
to
let
you
down
to
your
people
he
told
her
we
do
not
part
forever

your
father
that
i
shall
soon
visit
him
and
give
him
presents
i
know
that
i
did
wrong

you
from
him
without
his
consent
say
to
him
that
i
will
make
amends
for
that
you
are
good
and
i
love
you
more
than
ever
but
i
must
i
must
see
my
people
i
can
not
rest
until
i
do
mink
woman
told
him
and
kissed
him
the
people
then
swung
the
woman
in
the
basket
down
into
the
hole
she
had
torn
in
the
earth
and
began
to
pay
out
the
long
rope
and
slowly
little
by
little
the
woman
looking
up
saw
that
she
was
leaving
the
land
of
the
sky
gods
below
the
people
looking
up
saw
what
they
thought
was
a
strange
bird
slowly
floating
down
toward
them
from
the
sky
but
after
a
long
time
they
knew
that
it
was
not
a
bird
nothing
like
it
had
ever
been
seen
it
was
coming
down
straight
toward
the
center
of
the
big
camp
men
women
children
they
all
fled
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
the
dogs
close
at
their
heels
and
from
the
shelter
of
thick
brush
watched
this
strange
descending
object
it
was
a
long
long
time
coming
down
twirling
this
way
that
way
and
swaying
in
the
wind
but
finally
it
touched
the
ground
in
the
very
center
of
the
camp
circle
and
they
saw
a
woman
rise
up
and
step
out
of
it
they
recognized
her
mink
woman
and
as
they
rushed
out
from
the
timber
to
greet
her
the
basket
which
had
held
her
began
to
ascend
and
soon
disappeared
in
the
far
blue
of
the
sky
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
far
into
the
night
mink
woman
told
her
parents
and
her
people
about
the
sky
gods
and
the
sky
earth
and
even
then
did
not
tell
it
all
days
were
required
for
the
telling
of
all
that
she
had
seen
and
done
not
long
after
mink
woman
return
to
the
earth
and
her
people
thunder
man
came
to
the
camp
he
came
quietly
one
evening
the
door
curtain
of
lame
bull
lodge
was
thrust
aside
and
some
one
entered
mink
woman
looking
up
from
where
she
sat
saw
that
it
was
her
sky
god
husband
he
was
plainly
dressed
and
bore
a
bundle
in
his
arms
she
cried
he
is
my
thunder
man
and
lame
bull
moving
to
one
side
of
the
couch
made
him
welcome
said
thunder
man
wronged
you
by
taking
your
daughter
without
your
permission
i
come
now
to
make
amends
for
that
i
have
here
in
this
bundle
a
sacred
pipe
my
thunder
pipe
i
give
it
to
you
and

how
to
use
it
and
how
to
say
the
prayers
and
sing
the
songs
that
go
with
it
said
lame
bull
to
this
man
his
sky
god
was
very
angry
at
you
but
as
the
snow
melts
when
the
black
winds
blow
so
has
my
anger
gone
from
my
heart
i
take
your
present
i
shall
be
glad
to
learn
the
sacred
songs
and
prayers
the
chinook
wind
it
is
generally
accompanied
by
dense
black
clouds
that
obscure
the
mountains
thunder
man
remained
for
some
time
nearly
a
moon
there
in
lame
bull
lodge
and
taught
the
chief
the
ceremony
of
the
medicine
pipe
until
he
knew
it
thoroughly
in
its
every
part
is
a
powerful
medicine
thunder
man
told
him
will
make
the
sick
well
bring
you
and
your
people
long
life
and
happiness
and
plenty
and
success
to
your
parties
who
go
to
war
and
as
he
said
it
was
so
it
proved
to
be
a
most
powerful
medicine
for
the
good
of
the
people
thunder
man
departure
from
the
camp
was
sudden
and
unexpected
one
evening
he
was
sitting
beside
mink
woman
in
lame
bull
lodge
and
all
at
once
straightened
up
looked
skyward
through
the
smoke
hole
and
appeared
to
be
listening
to
something
the
people
there
in
the
lodge
held
their
breath
and
listened
also
and
could
hear
nothing
but
the
chirping
of
the
crickets
in
the
grass
outside
but
thunder
man
soon
cried
out
are
calling
me
i
have
to
go
i
shall
return
to
you
as
soon
as
i
can
finish
my
work
and
with
that
he
ran
from
the
lodge
and
was
gone
and
mink
woman
wept
who
can
know
the
ways
of
the
gods
surely
not
us
of
the
earth
thunder
man
promised
to
return
soon
but
moons
passed
two
winters
passed
and
he
came
not
to
lame
bull
lodge
and
his
woman
but
soon
after
he
left
so
suddenly
crow
man
returned
from
far
wanderings
and
heard
all
the
story
of
the
god
and
mink
woman
he
made
no
remark
about
it
but
spent
much
time
in
lame
bull
lodge
then
after
many
moons
had
passed
he
said
to
the
chief
one
day
you
remember
what
you
once
promised
me
when
your
daughter
so
suddenly
disappeared
you
promised
that
if
i
would
even
find
her
or
tell
you
whither
she
had
gone
you
would
give
her
to
me
when
she
was
found
well
here
she
is
fulfill
your
promise
she
is
no
longer
mine
to
give
she
now
belongs
to
thunder
man
the
chief
objected
me
tell
you
this
said
crow
man
promised
to
give
her
to
me
if
i
would
even
tell
you
where
she
had
gone
i
did
that
and
now
as
to
this
thunder
man
he
will
never
return
here
because
he
knows
that
i
am
in
the
camp
and
he
fears
me
so
you
might
as
well
give
me
your
daughter
now
as
you
will
anyhow
later
her
if
she
will
marry
you
i
agree
to
whatever
she
chooses
to
do
lame
bull
answered
crow
man
went
outside
and
found
mink
woman
tanning
a
buffalo
robe
have
your
father
consent
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
hope
that
you
will
say
yes

love
you
dearly
i
will
be
good
to
you
he
told
her
mink
woman
shook
her
head

already
married
my
man
will
soon
be
coming
for
me
she
answered
if
he
does
come
will
you

crow
man
asked
will
talk
about
that
later
i
will
say
now
though
that
i
like
you
very
much
i
have
always
liked
you
she
replied
more
moons
passed
and
as
each
one
came
crow
man
never
failed
to
ask
mink
woman
to
marry
him
she
kept
refusing
to
do
so
but
after
two
winters
had
gone
by
and
thunder
man
still
failed
to
appear
and
claim
her
why
her
refusals
became
faint
and
fainter
until
finally
she
would
do
no
more
than
shake
her
head
when
asked
the
great
question
then
at
last
in
the
falling
leaves
moon
of
the
second
summer
when
crow
man
asked
her
again
and
she
only
shook
her
head
he
took
her
hand
and
raised
her
up
and
drew
her
to
him
and
whispered
know
now
that
that
sky
god
is
never
coming
for
you
and
you
know
in
your
heart
that
you
have
learned
to
love
me
come
you
are
now
my
woman
let
us
go
to
my
lodge
my
lodge
which
is
now
your
lodge
and
without
a
word
of
objection
mink
woman
went
with
him
ai
she
went
gladly
she
was
lonely
and
she
had
for
some
time
loved
him
although
she
would
not
acknowledge
it
it
was
a
good
winter
buffalo
were
plentiful
near
camp
all
through
it
and
crow
man
kept
the
lodge
well
supplied
with
fat
cow
meat
he
and
mink
woman
were
very
happy
then
came
spring
and
one
day
in
new
green
grass
time
thunder
man
was
heard
approaching
camp
and
the
people
went
wild
with
fear
they
believed
that
he
would
destroy
them
all
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
mink
woman
had
married
crow
man
they
all
crowded
around
his
lodge
begging
him
to
give
her
up
to
send
her
at
once
back
to
her
father
lodge
but
crow
man
only
laughed
will
show
you
what
i
can
do
to
that
sky
god
he
told
them
and
got
out
his
medicines
and
called
to
come
to
his
aid
by
this
time
thunder
man
was
come
almost
to
camp
was
making
a
terrible
noise
just
overhead
but
came
quickly
came
in
a
whirling
storm
of
wind
and
snow
thunder
man
raged
shooting
lightning
making
thunder
that
shook
the
earth
made
the
wind
blow
harder
and
harder
so
that
some
of
the
lodges
went
down
before
it
and
he
caused
the
snow
to
swirl
so
thickly
that
the
day
became
almost
as
dark
as
night
for
a
long
time
the
two
fought
lightning
against
cold
thunder
against
snow
and
little
by
little
drove
thunder
man
back
he
could
not
face
the
cold
and
at
last
he
fled
and
his
mutterings
died
away
in
the
distance
he
was
gone
i
told
you
i
could
drive
him
away
said
crow
man
woman
you
people
all
rest
easy
thunder
man
will
never
again
attempt
to
enter
this
camp
and
with
that
he
told
that
he
could
return
to
his
far
north
home
he
went
taking
with
him
his
wind
and
storm
the
sun
came
out
the
people
set
up
their
flattened
lodges
and
all
were
once
more
happy
and
lame
bull
he
retained
the
pipe
and
found
that
its
medicine
was
as
strong
as
ever
and
from
him
it
had
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
and
father
to
son
to
this
day
and
still
it
is
strong
medicine
kyi
that
was
the
way
of
it
illustration
moving
camp
from
two
medicine
the
end
of
the
procession
ii
cutbank
down
came
our
lodges
this
morning
and
we
are
camped
in
cutbank
canyon
just
below
the
great
beaver
ponds
some
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
head
of
the
stream
when
i
first
saw
these
ponds
years
and
years
ago
they
were
dotted
with
beaver
houses
and
at
dusk
one
could
see
the
busy
woodcutters
swimming
from
them
in
all
directions
to
get
their
evening
meal
of
willow
or
quaking
aspen
bark
preparatory
to
beginning
their
nightly
work
of
storing
food
for
winter
use
i
never
killed
a
beaver
but
i
have
torn
down
beaver
dams
in
order
to
watch
the
little
animals
repair
them
beavers
have
a
language
as
well
as
men
there
was
always
a
chief
engineer
who
told
the
workers
just
what
to
do
and
he
himself
rectified
their
mistakes
we
are
encamped
right
on
the
main
war
road
of
the
blackfeet
into
the
country
of
the
west
side
tribes
once
when
camped
here
with
the
small
robes
the
band
or
gens
of
which
i
was
a
member
i
saw
a
party
of
our
young
men
make
their
preparations
and
start
westward
on
a
raid
they
gathered
in
a
sweat
lodge
with
an
old
medicine
man
who
prayed
earnestly
for
their
success
while
he
sprinkled
the
hot
rocks
with
water
and
dense
steam
filled
the
place
and
at
dusk
carrying
in
painted
rawhide
cylinders
their
war
finery
and
in
little
sacks
their
extra
moccasins
awl
and
sinew
for
repairs
and
their
little
paint
bags
they
stole
out
in
single
file
from
the
camp
and
headed
for
the
summit
of
the
range
every
evening
during
their
absence
the
old
medicine
man
rode
all
through
the
camp
shaking
his
medicine
rattles
singing
the
song
for
the
absent
calling
over
and
over
each
one
name
and
praying
for
his
safe
return
and
then
one
morning
some
two
weeks
later
they
came
into
camp
with
a
rush
driving
before
them
sixty
or
seventy
horses
that
they
had
taken
from
the
kootenais
and
two
carried
a
slender
wand
from
which
dangled
a
scalp
they
came
in
singing
the
song
of
victory
and
then
the
war
chief
shouted
a
multitude
of
the
enemy
are
on
our
trail
break
camp
you
women
and
move
down
river
take
your
weapons
you
men
and
turn
back
with
us
we
took
our
weapons
we
mounted
our
horses
and
rode
like
mad
up
the
old
war
trail
and
within
a
sighted
the
enemy
forty
or
fifty
of
them
strung
out
in
a
long
straggling
line
according
to
the
strength
and
speed
of
each
one
horse
we
exchanged
a
few
shots
with
the
lead
riders
one
fell
the
rest
took
their
back
trail
and
how
they
did
go
up
the
steep
incline
to
the
summit
and
over
it
we
did
not
pursue
them
let
them
go
bear
chief
shouted
we
have
many
of
their
horses
we
have
scalped
three
of
them
let
them
go
we
let
them
go
and
indeed
that
was
the
wiser
way
they
could
have
made
a
stand
at
the
summit
and
shot
us
down
as
fast
as
we
came
on
the
old
war
road
how
many
of
my
people
have
traveled
over
it
some
of
them
never
to
return
it
was
along
this
road
that
virgin
woman
warrior
led
her
warriors
in
what
was
to
be
her
last
raid
but
how
many
many
times
our
people
have
come
rushing
homeward
over
it
singing
their
songs
of
victory
waving
the
scalps
they
have
taken
and
driving
before
them
great
bands
of
the
horses
of
the
pend
the
snakes
the
nez
perc√©s
and
other
tribes
of
the
columbia
river
watershed
the
names
the
blackfeet
have
given
to
the
four
world
directions
are
most
significant
of
their
entry
into
this
missouri
river
country
north

direction
east

direction
and
west

i
have
told
why
the
two
medicine
was
so
named
when
the
blackfeet
came
into
the
country
from
the
far
north
and
drove
the
crows
before
them
this
river
they
named
cutbank
because
its
narrow
valley
for
a
long
way
up
from
its
junction
with
the
two
medicine
is
walled
in
by
cliffs

our
camp

on

little

mountain
the
cutbank
river
valley
like
those
of
all
the
other
streams
of
the
country
has
been
the
scene
of
many
a
fight
between
the
blackfeet
and
their
enemies
in
which
the
blackfeet
were
generally
the
victors
a
remarkable
instance
of
an
old
woman
bravery
occurred
just
below
here
some
forty
years
ago
a
few
lodges
of
the
or
never
laughs
band
of
the
blackfeet
in
need
of
the
skins
of
elk
and
bighorn
for
making
buckskin
for
light
clothing
and
moccasin
tops
were
here
hunting
and
one
evening
all
the
men
gathered
in
old
running
crane
lodge
for
prayers
with
his
beaver
medicine
an
old
woman
named
angry
woman
was
sitting
in
her
lodge
by
herself
because
there
had
not
been
room
for
her
in
the
crowded
beaver
medicine
lodge
but
she
was
listening
to
the
distant
singing
and
saying
over
the
prayers
at
the
proper
time
her
heart
full
of
peace
and
love
for
the
gods
as
she
sat
there
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
she
suddenly
noticed
that
the
doorway
curtain
in
the
upper
part
was
being
slowly
pulled
aside
to
the
width
of
a
hand
and
in
that
small
space
an
eye
glared
at
her
for
a
time
and
then
the
curtain
dropped
back
to
place
that
was
the
eye
of
an
enemy
she
said
to
herself
her
heart
throbbed
painfully
and
for
the
time
her
thoughts
were
confused
then
suddenly
some
one
perhaps
the
sun
himself
told
her
to
take
courage
she
took
courage
she
stole
out
of
the
lodge
to
see
what
that
enemy
was
doing
there
was
a
moon
bright
starlight
the
night
was
almost
as
light
as
day
and
she
had
no
more
than
left
the
lodge
than
she
saw
the
man
walking
here
there
examining
the
buffalo
runners
the
best
and
swiftest
horses
of
the
people
all
picketed
close
to
the
lodges
of
their
owners
whenever
the
man
back
was
toward
her
she
hurried
her
steps
got
closer
and
closer
to
him
and
then
suddenly
she
sprang
and
seized
him
from
behind
and
shouted
help
help
i
have
seized
an
enemy
in
the
beaver
medicine
lodge
the
men
heard
her
and
came
running
to
her
relief
she
had
the
man
down
he
was
struggling
to
rise
but
the
sun
must
have
given
her
of
his
power
she
held
him
firmly
until
they
came
and
they
seized
him
and
white
antelope
stabbed
him
to
death
he
was
a
gros
ventre
how
mountain
chief
found
his
horses
nephew
listen
magic
took
place
here
in
the
long
ago
said
yellow
wolf
as
we
sat
around
his
lodge
fire
this
evening
the
were
hunting
on
this
cutbank
stream
every
day
or
two
moving
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
mountains
at
one
of
their
some
distance
below
here
mountain
chief
lost
his
two
fast
buffalo
runners
and
although
all
the
young
men
of
the
camp
scattered
out
to
look
for
them
they
could
not
be
found
camp
was
moved
nearer
to
the
mountains
and
after
a
few
days
moved
again
this
time
to
this
very
place
where
we
are
now
encamped
blood
people
one
of
the
gentes
of
the
or
piegan
blackfeet
the
loss
of
the
two
buffalo
runners
was
all
that
mountain
chief
could
think
about
as
they
could
not
be
found
he
felt
sure
that
some
enemy
had
stolen
them
there
was
a
kootenai
indian
visiting
in
camp
and
one
day
he
entered
mountain
chiefs
lodge
and
said
to
him
are
grieving
about
the
loss
of
your
two
fast
horses
now
if
you
will
do
as
i
say
perhaps
i
can
find
them
for
you
you
ask
that
shall
be
done
mountain
chief
told
him
then
you
must
give
me
a
robe
a
good
bow
and
a
quiver
of
arrows
said
the
kootenai
are
yours
there
they
are
my
own
weapons
that
robe
take
them
when
you
want
them
said
the
chief
will
take
them
later
said
the
kootenai
now
call
in
your
leading
men
mountain
chief
went
outside
and
shouted
the
names
of
the
men
he
wanted
a
medicine
man
several
old
wise
men
some
warriors
of
great
name
they
came
and
were
given
seats
in
his
lodge
each
man
according
to
his
standing
in
the
tribe
said
the
kootenai
then
have
a
sacred
song
that
i
want
you
all
to
learn
i
will
sing
it
over
three
or
four
times
then
you
sing
it
with
me
he
sang
the
song
it
was
low
in
tone
and
slow
a
strange
and
beautiful
song
that
gripped
one
heart
but
it
was
not
hard
to
learn
after
the
kootenai
had
sung
it
over
four
times
all
there
could
sing
it
with
him
then
the
kootenai
told
mountain
chief
to
have
the
women
build
for
him
a
little
lodge
there
inside
the
big
lodge
this
they
did
by
leaning
the
sticks
of
two
tripods
against
one
of
the
poles
of
the
lodge
their
lower
ends
making
a
and
then
covering
them
with
buffalo
leather
into
this
little
enclosure
crept
the
kootenai
taking
with
him
a
bird
whistle
and
a
medicine
rattle
and
as
soon
as
he
was
inside
he
ordered
the
women
to
smooth
down
carefully
the
leather
coverings
so
that
he
would
be
in
the
dark
he
then
said
to
the
people
sitting
there
in
the
big
lodge
will
now
sing
the
song
four
times
it
is
a
call
song
to
all
living
things
the
birds
the
animals
the
trees
the
rocks
yes
even
they
have
life
all
will
come
when
we
sing
this
song
and
we
will
question
them
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
two
missing
horses
they
sang
the
song
four
times
and
then
the
kootenai
alone
in
his
dark
little
lodge
sang
another
song
keeping
time
to
it
with
his
rattle
and
the
people
listening
heard
outside
the
sighing
of
the
wind
through
a
big
pine
tree
although
no
such
tree
was
near
and
the
kootenai
questioned
the
pine
tree
and
it
answered
that
it
had
no
knowledge
of
the
missing
horses
then
at
his
summons
came
the
different
birds
and
the
animals
one
could
hear
outside
the
flutter
of
their
wings
the
tread
of
their
feet
and
the
kootenai
questioned
them
and
one
by
one
they
answered
that
they
had
not
seen
the
horses
came
then
a
big
rock
hurtling
down
through
the
sky
and
through
the
smoke
hole
of
the
lodge
right
into
the
fireplace
scattering
ashes
and
coals
all
around
the
lodge
and
frightening
the
people
sitting
there
and
the
kootenai
questioned
it
and
it
answered
that
it
knew
nothing
of
the
lost
horses
illustration
stream
from
unnamed
glacier
pouring
into
cutbank
ca√±on
us
sing
the
sacred
song
again
the
kootenai
called
out
from
his
dark
little
lodge
and
the
people
sang
it
with
him
not
once
but
four
times
the
kootenai
then
blew
his
whistle
four
times
four
long
loud
whistles
at
the
time
there
was
no
wind
but
soon
they
heard
far
off
the
roar
of
an
approaching
wind
of
terrible
force
said
the
kootenai
then
have
called
him
he
is
coming
be
not
afraid
he
will
not
harm
you
he
came
with
dreadful
whirlwinds
of
his
making
winds
that
shook
the
lodge
and
made
the
lodge
ears
hum
with
the
noise
of
that
of
a
hundred
swarms
of
bees
and
then
suddenly
the
wind
fell
and
outside
the
people
heard
this
wind
god
ask
have
you
sung
why
have
you
whistled
for
me
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
the
kootenai
answered
chief
here

lost
his
two
best
horses
fast
buffalo
runners
they
are
both
black
one
with
a
white
spot
on
his
side
i
called
you
to
ask
if

country
i
have
been
no
farther
out
than
here
no
i
have
not
seen
the
horses
i
am
depressed
the
kootenai
exclaimed
did
not
expect
to
learn
much
about
this
from
the
birds
the
animals
trees
and
rocks
even
the
bumblebee
could
tell
me
nothing
but
i
felt
that
you
would
surely
know
where
the
two
horses
are
i
have
a
friend
who
can
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
said
is

lives
in
the
clouds

tell
you
where
those
horses
are
is
a
stranger
to
me
how
shall
i
find
him
this
plume
the
kootenai
asked
and
all
the
people
held
their
breath
waiting
to
hear
the
answer
here
was
sacred
talk
talk
of
a
man
with
a
god
and
about
gods
they
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
real
that
which
they
were
hearing
answered
the
clouds
when
you
see
one
of
them
turning
from
white
to
red
as
the
sun
goes
down
to
his
lodge
on
his
island
in
the
great
sea
you
will
know
that
plume
is
there
above
you
that
red
cloud
is
his
plume
yes
when
you
see
that
sing
your
song
again
four
times
blow
your
whistle
again
four
times
and
he
will
answer
you
and
with
that
the
wind
suddenly
started
to
blow
from
the
east
and
went
with
it
back
to
his
western
home
and
they
heard
him
no
more
from
his
dark
little
lodge
in
the
big
lodge
the
kootenai
called
out
to
mountain
chief
stand
outside
your
lodge

for
a
cloud
turning
red
and
when
you
see
it
come
inside
and
tell
me
that
it
is
there
above
us
mountain
chief
went
outside
he
looked
up
and
saw
but
a
few
small
white
slowly
drifting
clouds
in
the
sky
there
were
four
of
them
straight
above
him
these
drifted
toward
one
another
and
he
cried
out
sign
a
sacred
sign
four
small
clouds
are
getting
together
to
make
one
large
cloud
and
at
that
all
the
people
in
the
lodge
cried
out
sacred
number

above
people

then
as
the
sun
was
setting
mountain
chief
cried
out

now
one
large
cloud
and
its
edge
is
beginning
to
turn
red
ai
the
red
the
sacred
color
spreads
over
it
his
voice
trembled
himself
he
trembled
for
he
knew
that
he
was
looking
not
at
an
ordinary
cloud
but
at
plume
himself
the
great
cloud
god
in
come
in
the
kootenai
cried
to
him
and
he
went
back
into
the
lodge
and
joined
in
the
singing
of
the
sacred
song
four
times
they
sang
it
oh
how
earnestly
the
kootenai
then
blew
his
whistle
four
times
followed
a
silence
the
people
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
and
then
they
heard
outside
in
a
deep
and
beautiful
voice
am
plume
why
have
you
called
me
here
plume
god
of
the
clouds

the
kootenai
answered

a
matter

buffalo
runners

with
a
white
spot
on
its
side

them
just
now
as
i
came
down
to
earth

are
standing
beside
the
spring
just
up
the
hill
from
where
you
camped
when
you
lost
them
ah
ah
the
people
exclaimed
in
hushed
voices
and
the
kootenai
questioner
of
gods
and
unafraid
cried
out
plume
sacred
plumed
god
of
the
clouds
you
are
good
to
us
tell
us
now
what
we
can
do
for
you
what
sacrifice
to
do
but
he
got
no
answer
plume
had
gone
gone
back
to
his
home
in
the
sky
and
the
people
rushing
out
from
the
lodge
looked
up
and
saw
him
moving
slowly
eastward
his
beautiful
plumes
redder
than
ever
and
while
the
kootenai
and
mountain
chief
and
the
other
warriors
made
sacrifice
to
him
some
young
men
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
back
to
the
where
the
two
horses
had
been
lost
and
lo
they
found
them
near
the
spring
where
plume
had
told
that
they
were
standing
even
in
my
day
the
many
beaver
dams
in
this
wide
canyon
were
in
good
repair
and
the
ponds
were
dotted
with
inhabited
beaver
lodges
there
are
few
of
the
little
woodcutters
here
now
but
in
time
to
come
under
the
sure
protection
of
the
supervisor
of
this
glacier
national
park
they
will
become
as
numerous
as
they
were
before
the
white
man
came
talk
about
beavers
brought
out
a
most
interesting
story
by
said
he
beavers
build
a
great
dam
often
working
moons
and
moons
to
complete
it
then
when
it
is
finished
and
a
great
pond
created
they
build
their
lodges
in
the
water
and
cut
their
winter
supply
of
cottonwood
willow
and
quaking
aspen
which
they
tow
out
in
convenient
lengths
and
sink
in
deep
water
around
the
lodges
now
after
a
few
winters
they
have
to
move
on
and
build
another
for
they
will
have
used
up
all
the
available
trees
and
willows
around
the
first
pond
but
that
is
still
their
pond
the
clan
that
built
it
and
in
time
when
a
new
growth
of
food
trees
has
sprung
up
around
it
they
return
there
repair
the
dam
build
new
lodges
and
remain
as
long
as
the
young
trees
last
white
fur
and
his
beaver
clan
away
back
in
the
ancient
days
when
our
first
fathers
were
able
to
talk
with
the
animals
a
beaver
chief
named
white
fur
with
his
family
and
his
relatives
built
a
big
dam
on
this
river
you
can
still
see
the
remains
of
it
and
it
still
backs
up
some
water
a
pond
as
large
in
extent
as
the
camp
of
our
tribe
but
in
the
old
days
that
dam
extended
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
valley
and
the
water
it
backed
up
was
more
than
a
pond
it
was
a
small
lake
above
here
there
is
a
swift
stream
of
white
water
rushing
down
the
north
side
of
the
valley
from
great
ice
banks
in
the
mountains
well
just
below
its
junction
with
the
river
is
where
white
fur
built
the
dam
time
passed
the
sons
of
other
beaver
clans
came
and
married
the
daughters
of
white
fur
clan
and
took
them
off
and
the
sons
of
his
clan
went
out
and
found
wives
and
brought
them
home
the
clan
increased
the
pond
became
full
of
lodges
the
trees
were
cut
in
greater
number
each
succeeding
summer
so
it
was
that
when
the
ice
went
out
one
spring
white
fur
went
around
and
around
the
pond
examining
the
remaining
food
trees
and
saw
that
there
remained
only
a
few
more
than
enough
for
the
coming
winter
it
was
no
more
than
he
expected
his
last
hurried
look
around
just
before
the
in
the
fall
had
warned
him
that
the
food
supply
was
getting
small
illustration
the
beaver
dam
he
went
home
and
called
a
council
told
what
he
had
learned
on
his
round
and
then
said
must
move
out
from
here
as
soon
as
the
ice
breaks
up
next
spring
and
when
we
go
we
must
know
just
where
we
are
going
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
time
hunting
for
a
good
place
to
make
a
new
home
now
who
will
start
out
on
discovery
will
his
eldest
son
loud
slap
first
answered
he
was
so
named
because
he
could
the
water
louder
than
any
one
else
in
the
whole
gens
now
loud
slap
was
white
fur
favorite
son
and
next
to
himself
the
best
the
wisest
in
the
gens
the
chief
wanted
to
keep
him
at
home
for
going
on
discovery
was
very
dangerous
but
for
very
shame
he
could
not
order
him
to
remain
and
let
some
other
take
the
risk
so
with
sinking
heart
he
said
spoke
up
first
my
son
so
you
shall
be
the
first
one
to
look
for
a
new
home
for
us
i
have
had
a
dream
and
i
want
you
to
find
out
if
it
told
me
truth
go
down
this
river
a
little
way
beyond
the
edge
of
the
pines
look
north
and
you
will
see
a
big
ridge
with
a
low
gap
in
it
go
up
through
that
gap
and
down
the
other
side
and
you
will
soon
come
to
a
small
branch
of
a
stream
look
at
all
the
branches
of
that
stream
for
a
good
home
for
us
and
come
back
and
tell
us
all
about
it
make
that
crossing
through
the
gap
in
the
daytime
for
then
the
most
of
our
enemies
the
mountain
lion
the
fisher
and
the
wolverine
the
wolf
and
the
coyote
are
generally
asleep
night
is
the
time
that
they
do
their
murdering
work
you
say
so
i
will
do
loud
slap
answered
and
the
next
morning
some
time
before
daylight
he
started
down
river
on
his
dangerous
trail
of
discovery
below
his
pond
there
were
other
ponds
and
as
he
swam
through
them
many
of
the
beavers
living
in
them
asked
him
where
he
was
going
on
discovery
our
food
trees
will
last
us
only
this
coming
winter
we
have
to
find
a
new
home
he
answered
them
all
on
he
went
through
the
last
of
the
ponds
down
the
river
swimming
fast
so
very
fast
that
his
big
webbed
hind
feet
swiftly
kicking
made
the
water
foam
past
his
breast
he
had
started
out
too
early
when
he
passed
the
last
of
the
pines
daylight
was
still
some
time
off
so
he
dived
under
a
pile
of
driftwood
then
crawled
up
into
it
found
a
good
on
one
of
the
logs
and
went
to
sleep
sure
that
none
of
the
prowlers
could
reach
him
there
the
sun
shining
down
through
the
little
openings
in
the
driftwood
pile
awakened
him
he
slipped
down
into
the
water
made
a
dive
and
came
up
out
in
the
middle
of
the
river
near
by
was
a
high
sloping
bank
bare
of
trees
and
brush
he
swam
to
shore
climbed
it
looked
north
and
saw
the
big
ridge
and
the
big
low
gap
in
it
he
looked
all
around
no
animals
were
in
sight
except
a
few
elk
and
he
knew
that
they
would
not
harm
him
he
began
waddling
toward
the
gap
the
sun
was
hot
loud
slap
legs
were
short
his
body
fat
and
heavy
there
was
no
water
he
soon
became
very
tired
and
thirsty
and
the
top
of
the
gap
seemed
to
be
a
long
way
off
more
and
more
often
he
had
to
stop
and
rest
but
he
kept
saying
to
himself
will
not
give
up
i
will
not
give
up
and
at
last
he
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
gap
close
up
to
the
top
on
the
other
side
were
thick
cool
groves
of
quaking
aspen
and
willows
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
valley
below
him
and
its
far
side
was
one
green
growth
of
trees
and
he
knew
that
somewhere
down
there
was
water
plenty
of
it
down
he
went
oh
how
easily
on
the
steeper
places
just
pushing
a
little
with
his
hind
feet
and
sliding
along
on
his
belly
he
soon
came
to
a
small
stream
of
running
water
and
drank
and
drank
of
it
rolled
over
and
over
in
its
shallowness
until
wet
all
over
and
then
he
followed
it
down
other
little
streams
came
into
it
and
at
last
it
became
so
deep
that
he
could
swim
after
a
time
he
came
to
where
this
stream
joined
a
much
larger
one
and
he
turned
and
went
up
it
and
away
up
in
the
timber
found
where
a
dam
could
be
built
that
would
form
a
very
large
pond
and
best
of
all
the
quaking
aspens
and
willows
were
everywhere
there
growing
so
closely
together
that
they
formed
a
food
supply
that
would
last
a
number
of
winters
that
night
loud
slap
slept
in
a
hole
that
he
dug
in
a
bank
of
the
stream
this
is
the
one
which
we
long
ago
named
i
understand
that
the
white
people
have
another
name
for
it
little
river
by
the
whites
named
milk
river
early
next
morning
loud
slap
came
out
of
his
hole
cut
down
a
small
quaking
aspen
and
ate
all
he
wanted
of
its
bark
he
then
swam
down
the
stream
turned
up
its
little
fork
and
before
the
sun
was
very
high
left
it
and
took
his
back
trail
up
through
the
gap
and
before
noon
was
going
down
the
long
slope
to
cutbank
river
the
going
was
easy
but
one
thing
troubled
him
the
risk
that
he
ran
traveling
there
in
that
open
waterless
country
whenever
he
came
to
a
patch
of
buck
brush
or
a
clump
of
tall
grass
he
would
sit
up
and
look
all
around
to
see
if
any
enemy
was
near
and
then
he
would
go
on
keeping
as
close
to
the
ground
as
possible
twice
he
saw
a
coyote
in
the
distance
and
sat
motionless
until
the
animal
moved
on
out
of
sight
and
then
when
almost
to
the
river
sitting
up
and
looking
out
from
a
brush
patch
he
saw
a
wolverine
coming
straight
toward
him
he
trembled
he
shivered
is
my
end
come
he
said
to
himself
and
imagined
how
it
was
going
to
feel
to
be
bitten
and
clawed
and
torn
to
death
because
of
his
helplessness
because
he
could
in
no
way
defend
himself
he
wept
but
silently
on
came
the
wolverine
sniffing
the
ground
sniffing
the
rocks
the
weed
growths
and
once
when
he
turned
and
looked
back
loud
slap
threw
himself
flat
there
in
the
brush
he
had
not
dared
move
before
the
wind
was
from
the
southwest
the
wolverine
was
coming
from
the
west
and
that
was
one
thing
in
loud
slap
favor
but
on
which
side
of
that
patch
of
brush
would
he
pass
if
to
the
north
then
he
would
scent
the
trail
follow
it
and
all
would
be
over
if
he
passed
to
the
south
of
the
patch
and
not
too
close
then
all
would
be
well
from
where
he
lay
flat
on
the
ground
in
the
brush
loud
slap
could
see
nothing
but
the
brush
stems
in
front
of
his
nose
but
presently
he
heard
close
to
the
patch
and
to
the
west
of
it
the
sniff
sniff
sniffle
of
his
enemy
he
closed
his
eyes
his
body
shook
with
fear
he
could
almost
feel
strong
jaws
closing
upon
his
neck
the
suspense
was
terribly
hard
to
bear
and
then
after
what
seemed
to
be
a
whole
moon
of
time
he
heard
the
sniffling
close
in
front
of
him
then
faint
and
fainter
off
in
the
direction
of
the
river
and
presently
he
opened
his
eyes
little
by
little
rose
up
and
looked
out
from
his
lo
wolverine
had
come
close
to
the
brush
patch
and
south
of
it
and
then
had
turned
and
was
now
walking
slowly
toward
the
river
enemy
passes
i
survive
loud
slap
said
to
himself
and
would
have
sung
had
he
dared
oh
yes
beavers
sang
in
those
days
as
you
shall
learn
loud
slap
watched
the
wolverine
go
on
down
the
valley
and
then
waddled
to
the
river
as
fast
as
he
could
work
his
legs
how
good
it
felt
that
plunge
into
the
cool
water
from
the
bank
and
once
into
it
he
made
it
foam
as
he
swam
homeward
against
the
swift
current
long
before
night
he
climbed
the
dam
of
the
upper
pond
and
a
little
later
entered
his
father
lodge
back
so
soon
what
found
you
my
son
old
white
fur
asked
fine
stream
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
gap
a
place
to
dam
a
large
pond
plenty
of
food
bark
trees
loud
slap
answered
and
then
told
carefully
all
about
the
place
and
about
his
narrow
escape
from
the
wolverine
then
his
mother
went
swimming
from
lodge
to
lodge
of
the
gens
calling
all
the
heads
of
the
families
and
when
they
had
gathered
in
white
fur
lodge
he
told
again
of
his
find
and
of
the
dangers
of
the
trail
all
went
home
pleased
that
he
had
found
such
a
good
place
for
a
new
home
for
them
white
fur
and
his
whole
gens
worked
very
hard
that
summer
to
get
in
sufficient
food
bark
sticks
for
the
winter
supply
they
had
to
drag
the
last
of
them
a
long
way
to
water
and
they
kept
at
it
long
after
the
snow
came
and
until
the
ice
and
cold
weather
prevented
further
cutting
the
trails
they
left
in
the
snow
just
before
the
pond
froze
over
were
a
sure
call
to
their
passing
enemies
and
they
halted
and
lay
in
wait
beside
them
and
killed
in
all
five
of
the
members
of
the
gens
one
of
them
loud
slap
oldest
son
a
lynx
was
seen
to
spring
upon
him
and
carry
him
off
as
he
was
going
out
to
finish
cutting
down
a
large
tree
the
winter
passed
when
spring
came
there
was
still
considerable
food
bark
untouched
on
the
underwater
piles
but
oh
how
glad
the
beavers
were
to
be
able
to
swim
about
again
and
eat
fresh
bark
from
living
tree
branches
all
were
anxious
to
start
at
once
for
the
new
home
across
the
ridge
but
white
fur
would
not
permit
it
from
the
pressure
of
the
winter
snows
the
dead
grass
of
the
past
summer
lay
flat
must
wait
until
the
new
grass
grows
high
enough
to
conceal
us
he
said
then
we
will
go
of
course
he
meant
those
that
would
be
able
to
go
females
with
newborn
young
were
to
remain
where
they
were
until
the
young
should
be
old
enough
to
travel
and
then
they
were
to
cross
the
ridge
and
join
their
mates
the
new
grass
came
and
when
it
was
a
little
higher
than
the
top
of
a
beaver
back
old
white
fur
and
loud
slap
led
all
those
who
could
go
about
fifty
of
them
down
the
river
on
the
way
to
the
stream
beyond
the
gap
white
fur
had
already
talked
with
the
chief
who
lived
in
the
next
pond
below
and
he
had
promised
to
keep
all
newcomers
from
occupying
the
pond
that
white
fur
and
his
gens
were
leaving
for
a
time
the
travelers
saw
no
enemy
on
the
trail
up
through
the
gap
and
upon
arriving
at
the
place
that
loud
slap
had
discovered
were
well
pleased
with
it
that
very
evening
after
a
heavy
meal
of
bark
they
began
work
on
the
dam
and
by
morning
had
much
willow
brush
laid
butts
to
the
current
across
the
stream
night
and
day
with
little
rest
they
toiled
to
complete
the
dam
of
sticks
and
stones
and
sod
and
earth
and
within
two
moons
time
they
finished
it
and
had
a
pond
large
enough
and
deep
enough
for
the
lodges
of
the
gens
and
all
the
food
sticks
they
would
need
to
sink
for
winter
use
then
one
evening
came
those
who
had
been
left
behind
came
with
their
strong
and
young
and
all
began
at
once
to
cut
and
bring
in
and
sink
the
winter
food
supply
long
before
winter
set
in
they
had
stored
more
than
they
could
possibly
use
and
from
that
time
until
the
ice
formed
they
did
nothing
more
than
strengthen
the
dam
and
eat
and
sleep
and
play
about
in
the
water
the
winter
passed
and
more
young
were
born
came
and
went
another
winter
and
in
the
spring
more
young
were
born
there
were
now
in
the
gens
many
two
and
three
and
some
both
male
and
female
and
they
could
not
mate
with
one
another
something
had
to
be
done
for
them
old
white
fur
called
a
council
and
there
was
much
talk
about
it
some
favored
sending
scouts
away
down
the
little
river
to
learn
if
there
were
any
beaver
colonies
along
it
others
and
the
greater
number
declared
that
the
unmarried
males
should
take
the
trail
through
the
gap
down
to
cutbank
river
find
mates
in
the
different
gens
having
ponds
along
it
and
tell
the
unmarried
males
there
to
come
over
and
take
wives
from
white
fur
gens
it
was
decided
that
this
should
be
done
and
one
morning
more
than
forty
young
males
started
for
cutbank
river
days
passed
and
yet
more
days
and
no
beavers
came
to
the
pond
on
little
river
is
wrong
white
fur
told
loud
slap
something
is
wrong
if
none
come
within
four
days
time
i
shall
go
over
to
the
cutbank
ponds
and
learn
what
the
trouble
is
the
four
days
passed
and
no
stranger
not
one
came
on
the
fifth
morning
loud
slap
once
more
took
the
trail
for
cutbank
saying
to
white
fur
as
he
left
i
do
not
return
within
four
days
time
then
send
some
one
over
to
learn
what
the
trouble
is
for
i
shall
be
dead
down
the
river
went
loud
slap
and
up
the
little
fork
and
thence
along
the
trail
through
the
gap
in
the
ridge
he
moved
along
very
cautiously
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
in
all
directions
and
seeing
nothing
to
alarm
him
after
passing
through
the
gap
he
saw
on
a
ridge
to
the
east
a
number
of
wolves
following
a
small
band
of
buffalo
and
that
pleased
him
for
seeking
food
there
they
would
not
be
likely
to
turn
and
cross
his
trail
he
hurried
on
down
the
slope
suddenly
when
near
the
river
a
whirl
of
wind
brought
a
dreadful
odor
to
his
nostrils
an
odor
of
dead
and
decaying
flesh
he
stopped
sat
up
looked
sharply
ahead
saw
nothing
to
alarm
him
went
on
a
short
distance
and
came
upon
a
scene
that
made
him
shiver
that
made
him
mourn
there
on
the
trail
and
on
both
sides
of
it
lay
his
youthful
kin
who
had
gone
out
to
seek
wives
there
they
lay
their
bodies
swollen
and
bursting
every
one
of
them
mangled
and
torn
several
half
eaten
by
their
enemies
wolves
probably
that
had
discovered
and
killed
them
all
one
look
at
them
was
enough
he
hurried
on
weeping
and
plunged
into
the
river
upstream
he
went
faster
than
he
had
ever
swam
before
and
soon
entered
the
lower
one
of
the
beaver
ponds
straight
to
the
lodge
he
swam
and
dived
down
to
the
entrance
and
went
up
into
the
big
and
comfortable
home
loud
slap
it
is
you
welcome
you
are
sit
youth
and
give
us
the
news
the
chief
cried
out
loud
slap
greeted
him
and
gave
the
news
and
both
wept
over
the
death
of
so
many
of
their
kind
the
chief
wife
went
out
and
spread
the
news
and
there
was
mourning
in
every
lodge
in
that
pond
the
chief
then
gave
loud
slap
bad
news
said
he
the
early
part
of
this
moon
came
to
us
a
visitor
from
the
big
pond
at
the
head
of
the
lake
on
the
next
stream
south
of
this
river

came
and
visited
us
and
our
kin
in
the
other
ponds
and
gave
no
reason
for
his
coming
and
soon
went
home
but
in
a
few
days
time
he
returned
with
all
his
gens
and
they
are
many
and
took
possession
of
the
upper
pond

pond
and
at
this
time
they
are
repairing
the
dam
and
backing
the
water
up
into
the
new
growth
of
food
trees
which
are
as
thick
as
they
can
stand
we
told
him

name
that
he
should
not
take
the
pond
as
it
belongs
to

father

fur
and
his
gens
but
he
said
that
he
did
not

taken
it
and
would
hold
it

for
it
against
all

strong
dam

back
to
his
little
river
home
the
next
day
and
told
all
that
he
had
seen
and
learned

and
mourned
for
their
dead
and
their
hearts

with
anger
against

his
gens

to
our
pond

and
we
will
teach
that
strong
dam
and
his
relatives
something
we
will
send
them
crying
back
to
their
pond
above
the
lake
they
started
the
next
morning
all
the
males
and
even
females
that
were
without
young
and
they
were
many
those
who
were
waiting
for
males
of
other
gentes
to
come
and
marry
them
old
white
fur
led
them
across
to
the
river
without
mishap
and
up
to
the
first
pond
where
they
visited
and
rested
and
ate
their
fill
of
fresh
green
bark
and
there
some
of
the
females
met
young
unmarried
males
who
wanted
to
mate
with
them
and
they
answered
will
marry
you
but
first
you
must
fight
for
us
you
must
help
us
drive
that
strong
dam
and
his
gens
from
our
pond
is
that
all
you
ask
they
replied
are
only
too
glad
to
help
you
who
would
not
fight
for
his
sweetheart
should
not
have
one
this
gave
white
fur
something
to
think
about
and
after
a
time
he
said
to
loud
slap
now
on
a
secret
mission
visit
the
ponds
of
our
friends
above
here
and
say
to
the
unmarried
males
that
our
young
females
here
will
marry
them
but
they
must
first
help
us
drive
strong
dam
from
this
river
that
is
a
good
plan
said
loud
slap
and
he
started
at
once
to
carry
it
out
late
that
night
he
returned
and
reported
that
all
the
young
males
had
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
would
join
white
fur
and
his
kin
when
they
came
along
us
start
now
said
white
fur
and
the
advance
began
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
dam
of
his
own
old
pond
he
had
a
large
following
there
was
a
young
man
lying
there
on
the
dam
a
ancestor
of
ours
who
had
gone
there
to
get
his
medicine
dream
his
vision
he
was
awake
and
when
in
the
bright
moonlight
he
saw
that
big
old
beaver
come
up
on
the
dam
and
a
hundred
and
more
beaver
following
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
and
cried
out
i
really
and
truly
awake
or
is
this
a
medicine
vision
keep
still
old
white
fur
told
him
you
see
is
real
we
are
come
to
fight
and
drive
off
those
here
who
have
stolen
our
pond
and
our
new
growth
of
food
trees
just
you
keep
still
we
want
to
surprise
them
if
you
see
that
they
are
beating
us
then
give
us
help
when
all
is
over
i
will
give
you
a
medicine
that
will
insure
you
long
life
and
happiness
the
young
man
no
otter
was
his
name
made
signs
that
he
would
keep
quiet
and
he
sat
there
and
watched
more
than
a
hundred
beavers
cross
the
dam
close
in
front
of
him
and
slide
quietly
into
the
pond
and
even
then
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
not
dreaming
as
they
entered
the
water
that
great
war
party
of
beavers
swam
out
in
all
directions
for
the
shores
of
the
pond
where
scattered
all
along
strong
dam
and
his
kin
were
already
cutting
the
young
trees
for
winter
food
and
as
he
watched
and
listened
the
young
man
heard
suddenly
a
great
commotion
and
squealing
all
along
the
shore
the
fighting
had
begun
then
almost
at
once
the
attacked
and
the
attackers
took
to
the
water
and
the
whole
surface
of
the
pond
was
as
if
it
had
been
struck
by
a
tornado
it
boiled
and
eddied
and
foamed
and
shot
high
in
spray
and
with
it
all
was
the
slap
slap
slap
of
beaver
tails
as
the
animals
struggled
and
clinched
and
floundered
and
bit
all
over
its
long
length
and
width
and
soon
beavers
frightened
and
gasping
for
breath
and
bleeding
from
many
wounds
began
to
pass
on
each
side
of
the
young
man
over
the
dam
and
drop
into
the
stream
below
and
disappear
in
its
swift
current
and
some
unable
to
climb
it
and
bleeding
from
many
wounds
died
there
at
the
edge
of
the
dam
and
sank
the
water
was
red
with
their
blood
one
of
them
crawling
out
staggered
right
up
against
the
young
man
and
gasped
and
died
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
felt
of
it
its
wet
coat
the
warm
but
now
breathless
body
and
then
for
the
first
time
was
he
sure
that
what
he
was
witnessing
was
real
and
no
dream
the
fight
was
over
the
last
of
the
enemy
had
been
killed
or
had
fled
down
river
and
white
fur
and
his
party
gathered
on
the
dam
not
all
were
there
some
of
them
lay
dead
on
the
bottom
of
the
pond
or
sorely
wounded
on
the
shore
white
fur
directed
that
they
should
be
helped
into
the
cool
lodges
where
they
would
be
safe
from
the
prowlers
and
there
cared
for
and
fed
that
done
said
white
fur
to
the
young
man
have
seen
a
great
sight
this
night
had
we
needed
your
help
i
know
that
you
would
have
given
it
you
had
but
to
call
and
i
would
have
been
with
you
the
young
man
answered
know
it
said
white
fur
just
for
your
i
shall
give
you
a
strong
medicine
and
teach
you
the
songs
that
go
with
it
but
i
can
not
do
this
here
you
will
have
to
go
home
with
us
to
our
pond
on
the
next
stream
to
the
north
illustration
bighorn
country
head
of
cutbank
river
they
went
there
the
next
day
leaving
behind
the
newly
married
females
and
their
mates
to
care
for
the
wounded
and
make
them
well
and
on
the
way
up
through
the
gap
and
down
to
the
pond
white
fur
and
loud
slap
told
the
young
man
the
story
of
their
lives
and
their
troubles
just
as
i
am
telling
it
to
you
and
upon
reaching
the
pond
on
little
river
no
otter
remained
there
a
long
time
with
the
beavers
the
old
chief
and
his
son
loud
slap
giving
him
a
medicine
beaver
cutting
and
teaching
him
the
beaver
songs
it
was
a
good
medicine
he
took
it
home
with
him
and
kept
it
and
made
ceremony
with
it
and
sang
the
songs
as
he
had
been
taught
to
do
and
because
of
that
he
had
great
success
at
war
and
in
curing
the
sick
and
he
lived
to
great
age
kyi
so
ends
my
story
yesterday
guardipe
or
as
i
prefer
to
call
him
climbed
with
me
to
the
top
of
white
calf
mountain
there
on
the
extreme
summit
of
the
rough
crested
mountain
we
came
upon
five
bighorn
all
ewes
and
not
one
of
them
with
a
lamb
beside
her
during
the
lambing
season
here
this
year
there
was
a
continuous
downpour
of
rain
and
sleet
and
snow
in
which
the
newborn
young
undoubtedly
perished
but
how
tame
those
five
ewes
were
we
walked
to
within
fifty
yards
of
them
and
they
gazed
at
us
curiously
now
and
then
nervously
stamping
the
rock
with
one
or
the
other
of
their
fore
feet
and
then
they
circled
around
us
twice
and
finally
walked
off
toward
the
eastern
point
of
the
mountain
often
stopping
to
look
back
at
us
and
finally
disappeared
behind
some
rock
piles
at
the
same
time
as
my
people
have
named
my
wife
was
having
her
own
experience
with
the
game
in
this
park
with
miss
l
a
boston
friend
she
was
sitting
near
the
edge
of
a
high
almost
cutbank
at
the
edge
of
the
river
when
she
heard
the
slow
heavy
tread
of
an
animal
back
in
the
brush
she
gave
her
friend
a
nudge
and
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
and
the
two
watched
and
listened
and
presently
they
saw
the
brush
shaking
as
the
animal
forced
its
way
through
it
and
then
half
revealed
and
half
concealed
in
more
open
brush
they
saw
a
big
grizzly
coming
straight
toward
them
right
near
where
they
sat
a
dwarf
juniper
grew
at
the
edge
of
the
high
bank
several
of
its
limbs
overhanging
it
without
speaking
a
word
and
trembling
as
though
they
had
ague
they
crept
to
the
tree
grasped
one
of
the
limbs
and
tenaciously
gripping
it
let
themselves
down
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
then
the
limb
broke
with
a
loud
snap
and
down
they
went
along
the
gravelly
incline
so
steep
that
they
could
get
no
foothold
over
and
over
head
first
feet
first
and
sideways
and
landed
in
the
river
with
a
loud
splash
but
they
did
not
mind
that
what
were
bruises
and
a
wetting
compared
to
being
mauled
by
a
grizzly
they
forded
the
stream
and
arrived
dripping
but
safe
in
camp
and
were
glad
to
be
there
although
this
glacier
national
park
is
only
five
years
old
the
game
animals
within
it
have
already
become
very
tame
the
bighorn
and
the
rocky
mountain
goats
no
longer
flee
from
parties
traversing
the
mountain
trails
and
the
deer
and
elk
and
moose
have
become
almost
as
fearless
as
they
are
as
for
the
bears
they
are
continually
trying
to
break
into
the
of
the
different
camps
undoubtedly
these
mountains
and
forests
within
the
next
ten
years
will
fairly
be
alive
with
game
and
as
to
trout
the
supply
is
increasing
instead
of
decreasing
in
this
cutbank
stream
alone
there
have
been
caught
this
season
in
the
neighborhood
of
two
thousand
trout
weighing
from
a
fourth
of
a
pound
up
to
four
pounds
but
since
the
of
april
seventy
thousand
young
trout
from
the
anaconda
hatchery
have
been
put
into
it
illustration
cutbank
river
a
good
trout
riffle
last
night
in
black
bull
lodge
we
had
more
tales
of
the
long
ago
in
this
cutbank
valley
would
that
i
had
the
time
to
collect
all
the
blackfeet
legends
of
the
various
places
in
their
once
enormous
domain
from
the
saskatchewan
to
the
yellowstone
and
from
the
rockies
between
these
two
streams
eastward
for
about
three
hundred
miles
there
are
tales
of
adventure
of
and
wonderful
legends
for
every
mountain
stream
butte
and
spring
within
that
great
area
said
black
bull
last
night
i
will
tell
you
a
story
that
my
grandfather
told
me
it
happened
in
the
days
of
his
fathers
boyhood
and
it
is
called
the
story
of
the
bad
wife
one
summer
in
that
time
the
people
having
made
new
lodges
moved
up
here
on
cutbank
river
to
cut
new
lodge
poles
and
to
gather
which
grew
in
great
quantities
back
on
the
high
mountain
slopes
huckleberries
at
that
time
one
of
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
was
falling
bear
he
was
a
very
brave
and
successful
warrior
and
very
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
keep
three
or
four
old
widows
and
several
old
and
helpless
men
supplied
with
all
the
meat
and
skins
they
could
use
and
even
gave
them
gentle
horses
for
packing
and
riding
whenever
camp
was
moved
at
the
time
the
people
moved
up
here
on
cutbank
he
had
been
married
but
a
short
time
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
otter
woman
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
tribe
and
with
her
father
and
consent
and
to
their
great
joy
and
pride
had
set
up
with
her
a
lodge
of
his
own
no
word
had
been
so
much
as
whispered
against
otter
woman
she
was
believed
to
be
as
good
and
pure
as
she
was
beautiful
of
face
and
form
the
tribe
had
not
been
here
many
days
when
falling
bear
decided
to
go
to
war
many
of
the
warriors
some
of
them
much
older
than
he
wanted
to
go
with
him
but
he
told
them
all
that
this
time
because
of
a
dream
a
vision
he
had
he
would
take
no
one
but
his
woman
he
made
full
preparation
for
the
war
trail
had
a
sacred
sweat
with
an
old
medicine
man
who
was
to
pray
for
him
during
his
absence
and
then
with
his
woman
he
took
the
cutbank
trail
for
the
country
of
the
west
side
tribes
all
of
them
enemies
of
the
blackfeet
traveling
with
great
caution
and
only
at
night
he
passed
through
the
country
of
the
flatheads
and
came
to
the
plains
country
of
the
nez
perc√©s
there
he
struck
the
trail
of
a
big
hunting
party
of
people
and
followed
it
and
soon
found
that
he
was
gaining
upon
them
one
early
morning
he
came
upon
their
which
they
must
have
left
on
the
previous
afternoon
for
in
some
of
the
fireplaces
there
were
still
live
coals
deep
down
in
the
ashes
now
on
the
night
before
he
had
lost
his
tobacco
and
his
desire
to
smoke
was
strong
within
him
so
he
said
to
his
woman
go
around
on
that
side
of
the
big
and
examine
every
lodge
site
for
tobacco
leavings
and
i
will
search
this
side
for
it
they
parted
and
began
their
quest
the
camp
had
been
pitched
partly
in
an
open
grassy
park
and
partly
in
the
timber
surrounding
it
and
because
of
that
falling
bear
and
his
woman
were
often
out
of
sight
of
each
other
at
one
of
these
times
otter
woman
was
examining
a
lodge
site
and
fireplace
back
in
the
timber
and
happening
to
look
off
to
one
side
she
saw
hanging
on
some
brush
a
fine
shield
some
beautiful
war
clothes
and
a
large
fringed
and
painted
medicine
pouch
she
well
knew
that
these
had
been
spread
out
to
sun
by
the
campers
and
forgotten
and
that
some
one
would
be
coming
back
for
them
and
was
about
to
go
after
falling
bear
to
come
and
take
them
when
she
heard
the
tread
of
an
approaching
horse
so
near
was
it
that
she
had
not
time
to
run
and
hide
she
stood
still
staring
and
almost
at
once
there
came
in
sight
on
a
pinto
horse
the
handsomest
young
man
that
she
had
ever
seen
he
was
so
handsome
that
to
look
at
him
gave
her
a
yearning
pain
in
the
heart
for
him
just
one
look
and
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
she
did
want
to
fall
in
love
with
him
she
just
could
help
it
he
this
nez
perc√©
checked
up
his
horse
and
sat
quiet
staring
down
at
her
and
no
doubt
thought
her
the
handsomest
woman
he
had
ever
seen
suddenly
she
began
making
signs
to
him
what
a
wonderful
thing
that
silent
language
is
all
the
tribes
of
the
plains
know
it
just
by
the
use
of
their
hands
they
can
express
their
every
thought
to
one
another
signed
she
man
is
over
there
be
quiet
i
will
go
to
him
somehow
get
his
weapons
from
him
then
hold
him
you
come
quickly
when
i
cry
out
and
kill
him
and
i
will
go
with
you
will
be
your
woman
of
course
nothing
could
have
pleased
the
nez
perc√©
more
than
that
to
kill
an
enemy
and
take
his
beautiful
woman
what
a
big
that
would
be
he
signed
to
the
woman
that
what
she
proposed
was
good
and
slid
from
his
horse
and
tied
it
to
a
tree
then
signed
to
her
to
go
and
he
would
follow
keeping
out
of
sight
the
woman
crossed
the
big
and
found
her
man
have
made
a
great
find
she
told
him
some
bushes
over
there
are
hanging
beautiful
war
clothes
a
shield
weapons
and
a
medicine
pouch
leave
you
your
weapons
and
things
here
and
come
with
me
and
take
them
why
should
i
leave
my
weapons
one
should
never
be
without
them
he
objected
from
here
goes
the
trail
we
are
to
follow
and
you
will
have
all
you
can
do
to
bring
here
what
i
have
found
she
explained
he
did
see
any
sense
in
leaving
his
weapons
but
took
her
word
and
laid
them
down
along
with
his
medicine
pouch
and
his
war
clothes
in
their
painted
cylinder
and
followed
her
out
into
the
open
park
things
are
right
across
there
in
the
brush
she
told
him
pointing
to
the
place
and
then
gradually
dropped
back
to
his
side
and
then
a
step
behind
him
then
as
they
came
near
the
brush
on
the
far
side
she
suddenly
seized
him
endeavoring
to
squeeze
his
arms
close
to
his
side
so
that
he
could
not
use
them
and
at
the
same
time
she
called
out
to
the
nez
perc√©
to
come
to
her
assistance
he
had
been
watching
and
was
already
coming
as
fast
as
he
could
run
falling
bear
of
course
saw
at
once
the
intentions
of
the
two
and
as
quick
as
a
flash
of
lightning
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
he
only
half
struggled
with
the
woman
now
grasping
his
neck
with
one
hand
and
arm
and
beating
his
eyes
and
face
with
the
other
hand
she
was
fast
blinding
him
but
he
stood
the
pain
of
it
until
the
nez
perc√©
with
war
club
raised
was
but
a
step
or
two
away
he
then
broke
loose
from
the
woman
kicked
backward
his
foot
striking
her
in
the
stomach
and
knocking
her
over
and
then
he
sprang
at
the
nez
perc√©
seized
the
arm
and
hand
that
held
the
war
club
high
and
struggled
with
the
man
for
possession
of
it
he
wrenched
it
away
from
him
and
with
it
struck
him
a
hard
blow
on
the
head
and
he
fell
his
skull
crushed
in
and
died
the
victor
scalped
him
with
his
own
knife
took
his
war
club
and
his
bow
and
arrows
and
then
turned
to
the
woman
she
lay
where
she
had
fallen
trembling
at
what
she
had
done
wishing
that
she
had
not
done
it
up
if
you
spoke
truth
if
there
are
war
clothes
and
other
things
over
there
lead
me
to
them
falling
bear
told
her
she
arose
still
trembling
but
now
with
some
hope
that
he
was
not
going
to
kill
her
and
led
him
to
the
place
his
eyes
were
swelling
shut
so
fast
that
one
was
entirely
closed
but
he
could
partly
use
the
other
he
looked
at
the
things
there
on
the
brush
here
are
the
war
clothes
the
shield
the
medicine
pouch
but
where
are
the
weapons
he
asked
the
woman
did
not
answer
what
could
she
say
there
had
been
no
weapons
left
on
the
brush
falling
bear
laughed
a
laugh
that
made
her
shiver
and
told
her
to
gather
up
all
that
was
there
and
follow
him
he
unfastened
the
horse
and
led
it
across
the
she
following
and
he
had
her
take
up
his
own
weapons
and
things
and
fasten
them
to
the
saddle
he
then
mounted
the
horse
and
told
her
to
lead
it
and
take
the
back
trail
home
before
he
had
ridden
far
his
other
eye
closed
he
was
for
the
time
wholly
blind
but
not
afraid
he
kept
close
possession
of
all
the
weapons
and
made
the
woman
do
everything
that
he
wanted
done
she
minded
his
every
word
traveling
again
at
night
and
hiding
in
the
brush
during
the
daytime
the
two
passed
safely
through
the
country
of
the
flatheads
and
crossed
the
mountains
on
the
morning
that
they
approached
the
camp
here
on
cutbank
falling
bear
had
partly
recovered
the
use
of
one
eye
the
other
was
still
swollen
shut
it
seemed
to
have
been
poisoned
by
the
fingernails
when
so
near
the
camp
that
they
could
plainly
see
the
lodges
falling
bear
told
the
woman
to
go
on
in
and
tell
her
relatives
to
come
to
him
that
he
would
await
them
right
where
he
was
they
soon
came
out
to
him
his
and
his
and
when
they
saw
his
scarred
face
and
swollen
eyes
they
cried
out
what
has
happened
to
you
have
you
been
in
a
fight
with
a
mountain
lion
than
that
he
answered
was
done
to
me
by
the
one
i
most
loved
and
trusted
and
then
he
told
them
all
about
it
and
concluded
by
giving
them
the
horse
and
all
the
things
that
he
had
taken
from
the
nez
perc√©
when
he
finished
his
awful
tale
the
two
men
listening
closely
were
so
overcome
with
shame
and
grief
that
for
a
time
they
could
not
speak
but
at
last
falling
bear
said
have
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
come
let
us
go
on
into
camp
they
went
in
falling
bear
to
his
own
lodge
in
which
his
father
and
mother
lived
his
woman
was
not
there
she
had
gone
to
her
lodge
he
was
glad
that
she
had
gone
there
he
never
wanted
to
see
her
again
his
father
asked
him
to
give
the
story
of
his
war
trail
and
he
answered
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
he
was
so
sick
at
heart
that
he
could
not
talk
arrived
in
his
own
lodge
and
finding
his
daughter
otter
woman
there
falling
bear
told
her
to
go
out
for
a
time
and
when
she
was
gone
he
told
her
mother
all
that
she
had
done
and
then
calling
in
their
son
the
three
agreed
upon
the
way
the
bad
wife
should
be
punished
they
called
her
in
and
told
her
to
braid
her
hair
nicely
and
to
put
on
her
best
clothes
and
while
she
was
doing
that
her
father
and
mother
and
brother
painted
their
faces
black
and
let
down
their
hair
as
soon
as
otter
woman
was
dressed
her
father
said
to
her
will
now
go
outside
and
you
will
mount
the
nez
perc√©
horse
i
will
lead
it
your
mother
and
brother
will
follow
and
we
will
go
all
through
the
camp
stopping
here
and
there
to
tell
the
people
all
about
the
great
wrong
you
did
your
man
no
no
not
that
otter
woman
cried
am
ashamed
enough
as
it
is
i
am
sorry
that
i
did
it
i
do
know
how
i
came
to
do
it
i
shall
never
never
do
such
a
thing
again
spoke
the
truth
there
said
her
father
you
will
never
do
it
again
and
he
ordered
her
to
go
out
ahead
of
them
and
mount
the
horse
she
did
so
and
sat
upon
it
head
cast
down
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
nor
ahead
shame
was
with
her
holding
the
rope
the
old
man
shouted
people
listen
and
when
a
crowd
had
gathered
he
told
them
what
his
daughter
had
done
to
her
good
man
and
the
people
groaned
with
shame
that
one
of
their
tribe
could
be
so
bad
of
heart
some
even
wept
at
the
horror
of
it
from
one
part
of
the
camp
to
another
the
old
man
led
the
little
procession
stopping
often
to
tell
the
shameful
story
until
all
knew
it
and
then
at
last
he
led
the
horse
out
into
the
center
of
the
great
circle
of
the
lodges
and
told
his
daughter
to
dismount
she
did
so
and
drawing
his
knife
he
stabbed
her
in
the
heart
and
she
fell
and
died
said
he
then
to
his
wife
women
to
help
you
drag
that
body
far
off
and
leave
it
and
never
let
me
hear
again
the
name
of
her
who
was
once
my
daughter
and
the
women
did
as
he
said
never
again
did
any
one
mention
otter
woman
in
his
presence
ai
a
sad
story
a
story
to
give
one
bad
dreams
let
us
have
one
of
more
cheerful
nature
before
we
go
to
bed
said
an
old
man
story
then
said
two
guns
all
are
laughable
elder
brother
tell
us
the
story
of
old
man
and
the
woman
said
black
bull
to
illustration
black
bull
and
right
near
lower
end
of
cutbank
ca√±on
ai
that
i
will
the
chief
answered
but
before
i
set
down
the
story
i
must
explain
old
man
old
man
was
the
god
who
created
the
world
and
all
life
upon
it
and
he
was
god
of
the
blackfeet
until
some
centuries
back
they
got
from
some
southern
tribe
another
religion
of
which
the
sun
is
the
principal
god
however
they
still
pray
to
old
man
as
well
as
to
the
gods
of
the
later
religion
although
in
time
a
great
many
stories
have
grown
up
about
old
man
that
make
him
appear
to
be
more
of
a
buffoon
than
a
god
an
interesting
point
about
the
word
is
that
while
it
is
the
term
for
an
old
man
its
real
meaning
is
dawn
or
the
first
faint
white
light
that
gives
birth
to
the
day
and
so
in
common
with
the
ancient
mexicans
various
tribes
of
the
plains
the
aryans
and
other
ancient
races
of
the
old
world
the
original
religion
of
the
blackfeet
was
the
worship
of
light
personified
let
us
have
now
the
old
chief
story
of
old
man
and
the
woman
having
created
the
world
the
animals
grass
trees
all
life
upon
it
old
man
realized
that
by
having
men
live
by
themselves
and
women
by
themselves
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
saw
that
they
should
live
together
the
camps
of
the
two
sexes
were
far
apart
the
women
were
living
here
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
in
cutbank
valley
and
the
men
were
away
down
on
two
medicine
river
each
camp
had
a
buffalo
trap
and
subsisted
wholly
upon
the
buffalo
that
were
decoyed
into
it
as
i
have
said
old
man
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
keeping
men
and
women
apart
in
fact
he
found
that
he
himself
wanted
a
woman
so
he
went
to
the
men
and
said
shall
no
longer
live
by
yourselves
come
we
will
go
up
to
the
camp
of
the
women
and
each
of
us
get
one
of
them
the
men
were
more
than
glad
to
do
that
it
was
what
they
had
been
hoping
to
do
for
a
long
time
so
they
hurried
to
put
on
their
best
clothes
and
neatly
braided
their
hair
and
then
started
off
with
old
man
for
the
women
camp
when
they
came
in
sight
of
it
old
man
told
them
to
stop
right
there
and
he
would
go
ahead
and
plan
with
the
women
just
what
should
be
done
they
sat
down
and
he
went
on
to
the
women
camp
himself
he
had
on
his
old
soiled
clothes
his
fine
clothes
he
had
left
back
with
the
men
arrived
in
the
camp
he
found
only
two
or
three
women
there
the
woman
chief
and
all
the
others
were
down
at
the
buffalo
trap
butchering
the
animals
that
they
had
that
morning
decoyed
into
it
when
he
told
the
few
women
that
he
found
why
he
had
come
he
greatly
excited
and
pleased
them
and
they
started
at
once
to
run
and
tell
the
others
to
hurry
up
from
the
trap
and
meet
the
men
wait
not
so
fast
i
want
a
word
with
you
old
man
called
out
and
when
they
came
back
to
him
he
asked
kind
of
a
woman
is
your
chief
that
is
good
and
kind
and
brave
that
is
our
chief
one
answered
and
another
said
she
is
all
that
and
more
and
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
us
all
this
pleased
old
man
he
said
to
himself
is
the
woman
for
me
i
must
have
her
and
to
the
waiting
women
he
said
is
right
that
chief
woman
should
mate
with
chief
man
you
women
are
to
come
to
us
and
each
select
the
man
you
want
now
tell
your
chief
woman
that
the
chief
man
is
brave
and
kind
and
handsome
and
that
she
shall
select
him
for
her
man
she
will
know
him
by
the
way
he
is
dressed
he
wears
buckskin
shirt
and
leggings
embroidered
with
porcupine
quills
and
a
robe
with
a
big
embroidered
sun
in
the
center
of
it
you
tell
her
to
take
him
for
her
man
will
do
so
the
women
cried
and
started
off
for
the
buffalo
trap
as
fast
as
they
could
run
old
man
hurried
back
to
the
waiting
men
and
hurriedly
put
on
his
fine
clothes
the
ones
that
he
had
described
to
the
women
trembling
with
excitement
and
out
of
breath
from
their
long
swift
run
old
man
messengers
arrived
at
the
buffalo
trap
and
told
their
wonderful
news
that
men
had
come
to
marry
them
that
each
woman
was
to
choose
the
man
that
she
thought
would
best
suit
her
the
butchering
of
the
animals
ceased
at
once
and
the
women
started
for
their
camp
to
put
on
their
good
clothes
and
recomb
their
hair
they
wanted
to
appear
as
neat
and
clean
and
well
dressed
as
possible
before
the
men
yes
all
ran
for
their
camp
all
except
the
chief
woman
said
she
can
not
leave
here
until
i
finish
skinning
this
spotted
medicine
calf
go
all
of
you
and
i
will
join
you
as
soon
as
i
can
the
work
took
more
time
than
she
thought
would
be
required
and
when
she
arrived
in
camp
with
the
valuable
skin
she
found
all
the
other
women
dressed
and
impatient
to
go
and
choose
their
men
well
it
does
matter
how
i
look
she
said

chief
i
have
a
name
i
can
go
choose
my
man
dressed
just
as
i
am
how
did
you
say
the
man
chief
is
dressed
they
told
her
again
what
he
wore
according
to
what
the
messenger
man
had
told
them
and
she
said
choose
him
chief
i
suppose
must
mate
with
chief
and
so
she
went
right
on
with
the
others
wearing
her
butchering
dress
all
stiff
with
blood
and
grease
from
the
neck
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
skirt
and
her
moccasins
were
even
more
foul
than
the
skirt
her
hands
were
caked
with
dried
blood
and
her
hair
was
not
even
braided
their
chief
leading
the
women
approached
the
waiting
men
all
of
them
standing
in
a
line
and
singing
a
song
of
greeting
old
man
stood
at
the
head
of
the
line
very
straight
and
proud
and
of
fine
appearance
in
his
beautiful
new
clothes
by
these
the
chief
woman
recognized
him
from
afar
and
said
to
herself
is
a
fine
looking
man
i
hope
that
he
will
prove
to
be
as
good
of
heart
as
he
is
good
to
look
at
and
leading
her
women
she
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
will
take
you
for
my
man
she
told
him
but
old
man
shrank
back
his
face
plainly
showing
his
loathing
of
such
a
bloody
and
greasy
woman
take
you
for
my
man
the
woman
chief
repeated
and
then
he
broke
away
from
her
hold
and
ran
behind
his
men
no
i
do
not
want
you
bloody
greasy
woman
he
cried
and
went
still
farther
off
behind
his
men
the
woman
chief
turned
to
her
followers
back
go
back
to
that
little
hill
and
there
wait
for
me
she
told
them
and
to
the
men
she
said
where
you
are
until
i
return
i
shall
not
be
gone
long
and
with
that
she
turned
and
hurried
to
her
camp
her
women
went
to
the
hill
the
men
remained
where
they
were
down
at
her
camp
the
chief
woman
took
off
her
old
clothes
and
bathed
in
the
river
then
she
put
on
her
fine
clothes
a
pair
of
new
moccasins
braided
her
hair
scented
herself
with
sweetgrass
and
returned
to
her
women
she
was
now
better
dressed
than
any
of
them
and
they
had
told
old
man
the
truth
when
they
said
that
she
was
beautiful
of
face
and
form
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
them
all
again
she
led
her
women
to
the
line
of
waiting
men
again
old
man
stood
first
stood
at
the
head
of
them
but
she
passed
him
by
as
though
she
did
not
see
him
and
he
with
a
little
cry
ran
after
her
took
her
by
the
arm
and
said
are
the
woman
for
me
i
am
the
chief
of
the
men
you
must
take
me
she
turned
upon
him
and
her
eyes
were
like
fire
she
tore
his
hand
from
her
arm
and
cried
touch
me
again
man
i
would
die
before
i
would
mate
with
you
and
to
her
women
she
said
not
any
of
you
take
him
for
your
man
and
with
that
she
turned
and
chose
a
man
the
others
then
one
by
one
took
their
choice
of
the
men
when
all
had
chosen
there
was
one
woman
who
had
no
man
all
had
been
taken
except
old
man
she
would
not
have
him
and
became
the
second
wife
of
one
of
the
men
the
choosing
over
all
started
for
the
women
camp
old
man
now
very
was
for
following
them
but
the
chief
woman
turned
and
motioned
him
off
away
there
is
no
food
for
you
no
place
for
you
in
our
camp
she
told
him
and
he
went
away
crying
by
himself
and
that
is
what
old
man
got
for
being
so
proud
we
break
camp
and
move
northward
for
the
past
two
days
some
of
us
have
been
riding
about
on
this
as
the
blackfeet
call
the
rocky
mountains
and
we
have
ridden
our
horses
where
in
former
times
nothing
but
a
bird
could
go
the
park
supervisor
and
his
engineers
and
miners
and
sappers
have
blasted
out
trails
over
the
highest
parts
of
the
range
making
it
easy
and
safe
for
tenderfeet
tourists
to
view
the
wonders
of
this
greater
than
alpine
range
of
mountains
one
of
the
most
impressive
views
is
from
the
summit
of
the
trail
from
upper
two
medicine
lake
to
cutbank
river
the
dry
fork
trail
it
is
called
at
its
extreme
height
the
trail
is
along
a
mountain
crest
about
thirty
feet
in
width
hill
graphically
described
the
stretch
the
other
day
when
after
crossing
it
he
said
on
its
east
side
one
can
spit
straight
down
three
thousand
feet
into
a
lake
and
on
the
other
side
cast
a
stone
that
will
go
down
much
farther
than
that
indeed
the
view
of
the
mountains
and
cliffs
and
canyons
from
that
height
is
so
grand
so
stupendous
and
impressive
that
one
can
not
find
words
to
describe
it
all
on
another
day
we
went
over
cutbank
pass
and
down
the
west
side
of
the
range
far
enough
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
pumpelly
glacier
and
see
the
huge
ice
blocks
break
from
it
and
drop
from
a
cliff
more
than
two
thousand
feet
in
height
they
strike
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
with
a
reverberating
crash
that
can
be
heard
for
miles
just
below
this
glacier
down
nyack
creek
three
or
four
miles
is
a
fine
alkaline
spring
and
clay
bed
where
in
other
days
old
and
i
were
wont
to
go
for
bighorn
goats
deer
and
elk
all
these
animals
came
to
it
in
great
numbers
and
drank
the
waters
and
ate
great
wads
of
the
salty
mud
we
once
killed
a
large
grizzly
there
whose
late
autumn
coat
was
as
black
as
that
of
a
black
bear

and
her

little
otter
in
cutbank
ca√±on
this
afternoon
we
have
had
further
talk
about
the
naming
of
these
mountains
for
a
wonder
the
topographers
have
not
taken
away
the
original
name
for
the
outer
mountain
on
the
north
side
of
this
cutbank
valley
we
find
on
the
map
that
it
is
still
white
calf
mountain
it
was
named
for
one
of
the
greatest
chiefs
the
montana
blackfeet
ever
had
as
a
young
man
fresh
from
his
first
war
trail
he
witnessed
the
signing
of
the
treaty
between
his
people
and
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
at
the
mouth
of
the
judith
river
in
so
he
must
have
been
born
in
or
as
a
warrior
his
rise
to
fame
was
rapid
and
many
are
the
stories
told
of
his
indomitable
bravery
in
facing
the
enemy
in
later
years
because
of
his
great
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
people
he
became
their
head
chief
he
died
in
washington
in
while
there
on
tribal
business
the
right
names
of
the
other
mountains
walling
in
this
valley
are
as
follows
the
unnamed
mountain
next
west
from
white
calf
mountain
is
generous
woman
mount
james
is
double
runner
mount
vorhis
is
wonderful
chief
the
west
one
of
the
twin
buttes
is
little
plume
the
east
one
is
wonderful
runner
and
as
i
have
said
the
outer
mountain
on
the
south
side
of
the
valley
is
angry
woman
all
but
the
last
one
were
named
for
great
chiefs
and
warriors
of
my
people
and
we
intend
that
they
shall
be
so
named
on
the
official
maps
even
if
we
have
to
petition
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
in
washington
to
make
the
change
and
you
my
readers
lovers
of
these
grandest
mountains
of
our
country
will
you
not
be
with
us
in
this
perfectly
proper
request
said
to
me
this
afternoon
who
are
these
white
men
james
and
vorhis
for
whom
the
mountains
were
named
were
they
great
warriors
or
presidents
or
wise
men
i
had
to
confess
that
i
had
never
heard
of
them
huh
he
exclaimed
and
huh
all
the
others
even
the
women
echoed
iii
little
river
we
moved
over
here
on
little
river
or
as
the
whites
have
named
it
milk
river
day
before
yesterday
and
made
camp
at
the
lower
edge
of
the
great
body
of
timber
in
which
the
stream
has
its
source
we
are
here
on
the
blackfeet
indian
reservation
and
several
miles
from
the
boundary
line
of
the
glacier
national
park
the
state
game
laws
do
not
apply
to
the
reservation
hence
we
have
the
right
to
hunt
upon
it
when
and
where
we
please
illustration
big
spring
painting
autobiography
on
the
flesh
side
of
a
tanned
yesterday
and
i
oiled
our
rifles
and
started
out
after
meat
we
went
up
the
river
passing
the
old
beaver
dams
that
white
fur
and
loud
slap
built
in
the
long
ago
and
presently
in
the
dense
growth
of
pine
cottonwood
and
willow
came
upon
old
and
fresh
tracks
of
deer
and
elk
we
followed
for
a
time
the
trail
of
four
or
five
elk
and
left
it
to
take
the
very
fresh
trail
of
a
moose
was
in
the
lead
and
within
ten
minutes
he
saw
the
animal
not
fifty
yards
away
standing
partly
concealed
behind
a
clump
of
willows
and
watching
our
approach
its
head
was
in
plain
view
and
he
fired
and
struck
it
just
at
the
base
of
the
ear
and
it
fell
gave
a
convulsive
kick
or
two
and
was
dead
when
we
got
to
it
it
was
a
bull
and
carried
a
very
ordinary
set
of
antlers
and
still
soft
at
the
points
i
dressed
the
carcass
while
my
companion
went
back
for
a
horse
and
before
noon
we
had
real
meat
in
camp
we
distributed
it
among
the
lodges
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
later
in
the
day
two
guns
and
black
bull
brought
in
a
fine
buck
mule
deer
and
at
sunset
big
spring
returned
with
the
meat
and
skin
of
a
yearling
ram
that
he
had
killed
on
the
outer
point
of
divide
mountain
it
was
like
old
times
the
camp
red
with
meat
and
we
all
felt
rich
and
happy
the
killing
of
the
moose
in
this
particular
place
brought
out
a
lot
of
reminiscences
of
happenings
here
on
little
river
in
other
days
and
of
them
all
i
think
that
story
was
the
best
as
the
pipe
went
the
first
round
after
our
feast
of
roast
moose
ribs
in
black
bull
lodge
said
he
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
old
man
and
the
wolves
one
day
in
that
long
ago
time
old
man
was
wandering
along
the
edge
of
this
forest
having
come
over
from
cutbank
way
he
was
feeling
very
lonely
and
wondering
what
he
could
do
to
have
a
more
lively
time
when
as
he
approached
the
river
here
probably
right
where
we
are
camped
he
saw
a
band
of
six
wolves
sitting
on
the
bank
watching
him
he
stopped
short
watched
them
for
a
time
and
then
approached
them
whining
out
younger
brothers
my
younger
brothers
i
am
very
lonely
take
pity
on
me
let
me
be
a
wolf
with
you
as
i
have
said
the
wolves
were
six
the
old
father
and
mother
their
two
daughters
and
their
sons
heavy
body
and
long
body
the
old
father
wolf
answered
old
man
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
it
that
you
want
me
to
change
you
into
a
wolf
that
you
want
to
live
just
as
we
do
want
to
live
with
you
hunt
with
you
he
answered
i
want
to
be
changed
wholly
into
a
wolf
just
make
my
head
and
neck
to
look
like
yours
and
put
wolf
hair
on
my
legs
and
arms
and
that
will
be
about
enough
of
a
change
i
will
keep
my
body
just
as
it
is
well
we
will
do
that
for
you
said
the
old
wolf
and
he
took
a
gray
medicine
and
rubbed
it
on
old
man
head
and
neck
and
legs
and
arms
and
made
the
change
said
he
work
is
done
i
would
like
to
have
made
you
all
wolf
your
body
as
well
as
the
rest
of
you
but
you
will
do
as
you
are
you
are
quite
and
now
let
me
tell
you
something
about
our
family
my
old
wife
and
i
do
hunt
much
your
two
younger
brothers
there
are
the
runners
and
killers
and
their
sisters
help
in
the
way
of
heading
off
and
confusing
the
game
your
younger
brother
there
long
body
is
the
swiftest
runner
but
he
has
the
best
of
wind
however
he
generally
overtakes
and
kills
whatever
he
chases
your
other
younger
brother
heavy
body
is
not
a
fast
runner
but
he
has
great
staying
power
never
gets
winded
and
in
the
end
brings
down
his
game
and
now
you
know
them
whenever
you
feel
like
hunting
one
or
the
other
of
them
as
you
choose
will
go
with
you
are
very
kind
to
me
said
old
man
am
now
very
tired
but
i
shall
want
to
hunt
with
one
or
the
other
of
them
are
also
tired
we
have
come
a
long
way
it
is
best
that
we
all
rest
during
this
night
said
the
old
wolf
and
he
led
the
way
up
to
the
top
of
a
high
ridge
on
the
north
side
of
the
valley
where
all
lay
down
why
rest
out
on
top
of
this
barren
windy
place
instead
of
in
the
shelter
of
the
timber
old
man
asked
his
teeth
beginning
to
chatter
from
the
cold
never
rest
in
the
timber
the
old
wolf
replied
enemies
would
have
a
good
chance
to
take
us
unawares
here
we
can
see
afar
everything
that
moves
and
as
one
or
another
of
us
is
always
on
watch
we
can
keep
out
of
danger
also
we
can
look
down
and
see
the
different
kinds
of
game
and
make
our
plans
to
chase
what
we
want
head
it
off
tire
it
out
and
kill
it
we
always
summer
and
winter
do
our
resting
and
sleeping
on
high
places
before
the
night
was
far
gone
old
man
became
so
cold
that
he
trembled
all
over
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
keep
his
jaws
together
annoy
us
with
your
tremblings
and
your
teeth
chatterings
you
keep
us
from
sleeping
the
old
wolf
complained
i
shall
not
annoy
you
long
old
man
answered
i
shall
soon
freeze
to
death
the
old
wolf
aroused
his
wife
and
children
elder
brother
of
ours
is
freezing
i
suppose
we
have
to
protect
him
lie
down
in
a
circle
around
him
and
cover
him
with
your
tails
he
told
them
they
did
so
and
he
was
soon
overcome
with
heat
your
tails
from
my
body
i
am
wet
with
perspiration
he
gasped
they
removed
their
tails
and
he
soon
began
to
shiver
them
back
i
freeze
he
cried
and
they
did
as
he
commanded
during
the
night
he
had
them
cover
him
many
times
with
their
tails
and
as
many
times
remove
them
he
passed
a
miserable
night
and
so
did
the
wolves
for
he
kept
them
from
sleeping
at
break
of
day
all
arose
and
looking
down
into
the
valley
saw
a
lone
buck
mule
deer
feeding
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
timber
they
made
a
plan
for
capturing
it
they
all
sneaked
around
into
the
timber
and
then
long
body
and
old
man
crept
down
the
valley
until
the
buck
saw
them
and
ran
and
then
they
chased
it
long
body
soon
pulled
it
down
and
old
man
came
up
in
time
to
seize
and
break
its
neck
and
felt
very
proud
of
himself
the
other
wolves
soon
came
to
the
kill
and
all
feasted
the
carcass
lasted
them
two
days
again
and
again
they
went
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
to
pass
the
night
and
old
man
soon
became
so
used
to
the
cold
that
he
did
not
need
tail
covering
when
the
deer
was
eaten
they
killed
another
one
and
then
a
buffalo
bull
which
lasted
them
some
days
then
after
two
failures
in
chasing
antelope
and
some
hungry
days
long
body
killed
a
big
bull
elk
just
outside
the
timber
here
they
were
several
days
eating
it
but
at
last
all
the
meat
and
the
soft
bones
were
finished
and
nothing
but
the
backbone
and
the
hard
leg
bones
remained
said
the
old
wolf
then
must
be
saving
of
what
we
have
left
for
it
may
be
some
time
before
we
can
make
another
killing
we
will
take
turns
chewing
the
upper
bone
of
a
hind
leg
they
gathered
in
a
small
circle
with
one
of
the
bones
noses
to
the
center
and
the
old
wolf
said
to
old
man
while
this
chewing
is
going
on
bone
splinters
are
bound
to
fly
you
must
keep
your
eyes
tight
shut
until
it
comes
your
turn
to
chew
else
you
may
get
a
splinter
that
will
blind
you
old
man
did
as
he
was
told
the
old
wolf
began
the
chewing
and
after
gnawing
off
the
end
of
the
bone
and
getting
a
little
of
the
marrow
called
out
to
his
wife
that
it
was
her
turn
to
chew
and
passed
her
the
bone
and
so
from
one
to
another
it
went
around
the
circle
until
long
body
got
it
and
old
man
turn
came
next
his
curiosity
now
got
the
better
of
him
he
just
had
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
slowly
opened
one
eye
the
one
next
to
long
body
all
the
wolves
had
their
heads
to
the
ground
or
resting
on
their
fore
paws
and
all
even
long
body
busily
chewing
the
bone
kept
their
eyes
tight
shut
this
is
a
queer
way
to
feast
old
man
said
to
himself
and
just
then
a
splinter
flew
from
the
bone
and
struck
his
open
eye
not
putting
it
out
but
causing
him
great
pain
and
making
him
very
angry
will
pay
him
for
that
he
thought
and
waited
his
turn
at
the
bone
becoming
more
and
more
angry
as
he
waited
turn
old
man
said
long
body
after
a
time
and
passed
him
the
bone
old
man
took
it
chewed
it
for
a
time
looking
sharply
at
all
the
wolves
all
had
their
eyes
tight
shut
so
raising
the
bone
as
high
as
he
could
he
brought
it
down
with
all
the
force
of
his
arm
upon
long
body
head
and
killed
him
the
other
wolves
hearing
his
twitching
as
he
died
opened
their
eyes
saw
him
dead
and
old
man
staring
in
horror
at
what
he
had
done
what
have
you
done
you
have
killed
your
younger
brother
the
old
wolf
cried
did
mean
to
old
man
answered
he
was
chewing
the
bone
he
let
a
splinter
fly
and
it
struck
me
in
this
eye
i
meant
to
punish
him
a
little
for
being
so
careless
but
i
did
not
mean
to
kill
him
i
must
have
struck
harder
than
i
thought
to
do
had
your
eyes
open
it
was
your
fault
that
you
got
the
splinter
the
old
wolf
said
and
then
he
and
all
the
rest
began
grieving
for
their
dead
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
all
through
the
night
they
howled
and
howled
and
old
man
thought
that
he
would
go
mad
from
the
mournfulness
of
it
all
he
was
very
sorry
he
hated
himself
for
what
he
had
done
in
his
anger
the
over
the
wolves
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
buried
long
body
and
then
scolded
old
man
you
killed
my
son
intentionally
the
old
wolf
concluded
would
have
had
your
life
in
payment
for
his
life
as
it
is
we
will
give
you
one
more
trial
see
that
such
an
accident
as
that
never
again
occurs
brother
said
old
man
am
grieving
and
very
restless
because
of
what
i
have
done
i
want
to
be
moving
to
be
doing
something
let
heavy
body
go
with
me
up
in
this
pine
forest
and
we
will
try
to
kill
something
the
old
wolf
remained
silent
for
some
time
thinking
and
at
last
answered
i
will
allow
him
to
go
with
you
and
remember
this
if
anything
happens
to
him
we
shall
hold
you
responsible
and
great
will
be
your
punishment
the
two
started
off
and
old
man
said
to
his
partner
some
ways
i
am
wiser
than
you
i
have
this
to
say
and
you
must
heed
it
whatever
you
start
after
be
it
deer
or
elk
or
moose
and
no
matter
how
close
you
may
get
to
it
if
it
crosses
a
stream
even
a
little
stream
that
you
can
jump
stop
right
there
and
turn
back
mind
now
even
if
a
few
more
leaps
will
get
you
to
the
animal
throat
you
are
not
to
make
those
leaps
if
it
crosses
a
stream
should
you
keep
on
death
in
some
form
will
get
you
do
you
know
this
heavy
body
asked
may
not
tell
you
all
that
i
know
old
man
replied
have
given
you
the
warning
heed
it
they
went
farther
up
in
the
timber
and
after
some
nosing
of
trails
started
a
big
bull
moose
and
took
after
it
heavy
body
running
far
in
the
lead
he
was
fast
gaining
upon
it
was
almost
at
its
heels
when
it
jumped
into
a
wide
long
pond
really
a
widening
of
the
creek
and
started
swimming
across
it
to
an
island
and
from
that
to
the
other
shore
heavy
body
thought
of
old
man
warning
but
said
to
himself
does
know
everything
i
must
have
that
moose
and
into
the
water
he
went
and
started
swimming
toward
the
island
and
just
as
he
was
nearing
it
a
water
bear
sprang
from
the
shore
and
killed
him
and
dragged
him
to
land
and
old
man
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
just
in
time
to
see
the
bear
and
her
two
nearly
grown
young
begin
feasting
upon
her
kill
with
a
heart
full
of
rage
and
sorrow
he
turned
back
into
the
timber
and
considered
how
he
could
revenge
the
death
of
heavy
body
two
mornings
later
just
before
daylight
old
man
came
again
to
the
shore
of
the
pond
and
close
to
the
edge
of
the
water
took
his
stand
and
gave
himself
the
appearance
of
an
old
stump
soon
after
sunrise
the
old
water
bear
coming
out
from
the
brush
on
the
island
saw
it
sat
up
and
stared
at
it
and
said
to
herself
do
not
remember
having
seen
that
stump
before
i
suspicion
that
it
is
old
man
come
to
do
me
harm
i
saw
him
right
there
when
i
killed
the
wolf
she
stared
and
stared
at
the
stump
and
at
last
called
out
her
young
and
said
to
one
of
them
across
there
and
bite
and
claw
that
stump
i
believe
that
it
is
old
man
if
it
is
he
will
cry
out
and
run
when
you
hurt
him
the
young
bear
swam
across
and
went
up
to
the
stump
and
bit
and
clawed
it
and
hurt
old
man
he
was
almost
on
the
point
of
giving
up
and
running
away
when
it
left
him
and
went
back
to
the
island
and
told
the
old
one
that
the
stump
was
a
stump
and
nothing
else
but
the
old
one
was
not
satisfied
she
sent
the
other
young
one
over
and
it
bit
and
clawed
old
man
harder
than
its
brother
had
but
he
stood
the
pain
bad
as
it
was
and
that
young
one
went
back
and
also
said
that
the
stump
was
just
a
common
old
stump
and
without
life
but
the
old
water
bear
was
not
yet
satisfied
she
went
across
herself
and
bit
and
tore
at
the
stump
with
her
claws
and
what
old
man
had
suffered
from
the
others
was
nothing
compared
to
what
he
endured
from
her
attack
he
stood
it
however
and
at
last
satisfied
that
her
children
had
been
right
that
this
was
a
stump
and
nothing
else
she
left
it
and
started
back
for
the
island
then
it
was
that
just
as
she
was
entering
the
water
old
man
picked
up
the
bow
and
arrows
he
had
made
during
the
two
days
back
in
the
timber
and
shot
an
arrow
into
her
well
back
in
the
loin
but
she
dove
under
water
so
quickly
that
he
could
not
see
whether
he
had
hit
her
or
not
she
swam
under
water
clear
around
back
of
the
island
and
went
ashore
where
he
could
not
see
her
he
turned
then
and
went
away
back
in
the
timber
and
slept
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
of
the
following
night
early
the
next
morning
he
was
approaching
the
pond
by
way
of
the
stream
running
from
it
when
he
saw
a
kingfisher
sitting
on
a
limb
of
a
tree
overhanging
the
water
and
looking
intently
down
into
it
brother
what
do
you
there
he
asked
old
water
bear
has
been
shot
the
bird
answered
bathes
in
the
water
and
clots
of
blood
and
pieces
of
fat
escape
from
the
wound
and
when
they
come
floating
along
here
i
seize
them
and
eat
them
so
i
did
hit
her
old
man
said
badly
i
wonder
he
went
on
up
the
shore
of
the
stream
trying
to
think
of
some
way
to
get
complete
revenge
for
the
death
of
heavy
body
when
he
heard
some
one
out
in
the
brush
chanting
one
has
shot
the
old
water
bear
i
have
to
doctor
the
old
water
bear
some
one
has
shot
the
old
water
bear
i
have
to
doctor
the
old
water
bear
he
went
out
to
see
who
this
might
be
and
found
that
it
was
the
bull
frog
jumping
about
and
making
the
chant
after
every
jump
he
went
to
him
and
asked
if
the
bear
was
much
hurt
is
an
arrow
in
her
loin
the
frog
answered
as
soon
as
i
find
a
certain
medicine
plant
i
shall
pull
the
arrow
out
and
apply
the
crushed
plant
to
the
wound
i
believe
that
i
can
save
her
life
you
never
will
old
man
said
and
fired
an
arrow
into
him
and
killed
him
he
then
took
his
skin
put
it
on
tore
up
a
handful
of
a
green
plant
and
swam
to
the
island
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
shore
he
began
chanting
as
the
frog
had
done
one
has
shot
the
old
water
bear
i
have
to
doctor
the
old
water
bear
and
so
chanting
and
jumping
he
followed
a
trail
into
the
brush
and
came
upon
the
old
bear
and
her
two
young
she
was
lying
on
her
side
breathing
heavily
and
her
eyes
were
shut
old
man
bent
over
her
and
firmly
grasping
the
arrow
shoved
it
in
until
it
pierced
her
heart
and
she
gave
a
kick
and
died
he
then
picked
up
a
club
and
killed
the
two
young
that
ends
the
water
bear
family
i
was
crazy
ever
to
have
made
her
and
her
husband
he
exclaimed
casting
off
the
frog
skin
now
he
with
great
difficulty
floated
the
three
bears
from
the
island
to
the
shore
of
the
pond
there
a
short
distance
back
from
it
he
found
a
depression
in
the
ground
into
this
he
dragged
the
carcasses
of
the
bears
after
skinning
them
and
taking
off
all
the
fat
from
their
meat
and
insides
and
then
he
tried
out
the
fat
and
poured
the
oil
over
them
completely
covering
them
and
filling
the
depression
he
then
called
the
animals
you
who
would
be
fat
come
bathe
in
this
oil
he
shouted
and
on
all
sides
the
animals
heard
and
began
to
come
in
the
bears
real
bears
the
grizzly
and
the
black
came
first
and
rolled
in
the
oil
and
ever
since
that
time
they
have
been
the
fattest
of
all
animals
then
came
the
skunk
next
the
badger
after
him
the
porcupine
and
rolled
in
the
oil
and
got
fat
the
beaver
came
and
swam
across
the
oil
all
that
part
of
him
above
the
water
as
he
swam
his
head
and
the
forward
part
of
his
back
got
no
fat
but
all
the
rest
of
his
body
his
sides
belly
and
tail
became
extremely
fat
last
of
all
the
animals
came
the
rabbit
he
did
not
go
into
the
oil
but
dipping
a
paw
into
it
rubbed
it
upon
his
back
between
his
shoulders
and
upon
the
inside
of
each
leg
that
is
why
he
has
no
fat
on
other
parts
of
his
body
there
old
man
exclaimed
after
the
rabbit
had
gone
have
done
some
good
i
have
avenged
the
death
of
my
wolf
partner
and
have
made
fat
many
of
my
younger
brothers
and
with
that
he
started
off
seeking
more
adventures
kyi
my
story
ends
not
for
many
years
i
am
sure
have
my
relatives
and
friends
here
been
so
happy
as
they
are
just
now
instead
of
beef
or
no
meat
of
any
kind
as
is
generally
the
case
with
them
when
at
home
some
die
every
winter
from
want
of
food
they
have
now
in
every
lodge
real
meat
meat
of
moose
and
elk
and
bighorn
and
so
are
living
much
as
they
did
in
the
days
before
the
white
men
overran
their
country
and
killed
off
their
game
illustration
sun
woman
daughter
of
and
wife
of
a
happy
heart
sharpens
one
wits
all
day
yesterday
as
i
knew
my
two
old
relatives
and
yellow
wolf
were
considering
what
other
one
of
the
tribal
stories
about
the
little
river
country
would
most
please
me
i
had
told
them
that
i
could
not
put
them
all
down
could
use
only
two
or
three
of
the
most
interesting
ones
and
so
when
we
all
gathered
in
yellow
wolf
lodge
last
evening
and
the
pipe
was
lighted
and
started
on
the
round
of
our
circle
he
said
that
it
had
been
decided
that
i
should
have
the
story
of
the
rescue
of
a
boy
from
the
crows
and
that
he
would
tell
it
it
was
called
he
said
the
story
of
new
robe
the
rescuer
in
the
long
ago
before
our
forefathers
had
taken
this
country
from
the
crows
they
were
one
summer
camping
and
hunting
on
the
big
river
of
the
north
came
the
evening
of
a
long
hot
day
and
a
boy
of
eight
or
nine
winters
lone
star
was
his
name
failed
to
return
to
his
parents
lodge
the
chiefs
ordered
the
camp
crier
out
and
he
went
all
among
the
lodges
shouting
the
news
and
asking
if
any
one
had
seen
the
boy
none
had
so
then
the
chiefs
ordered
all
the
men
and
youths
to
go
out
and
try
to
find
him
all
that
moonlit
night
and
all
the
next
day
they
searched
the
surrounding
country
but
got
no
trace
of
him
every
alighting
buzzard
was
marked
down
but
in
every
instance
it
was
found
to
be
feasting
upon
the
remains
of
game
that
the
hunters
had
killed
so
then
although
his
body
could
not
be
found
most
of
the
people
believed
that
the
boy
was
dead
his
beautiful
sister
red
cloud
woman
and
his
father
black
bear
thought
otherwise
they
believed
that
he
had
been
stolen
by
the
enemy
and
publicly
all
through
the
camp
the
two
went
the
girl
vowing
that
she
would
marry
whoever
would
find
her
brother
the
old
man
adding
that
she
had
his
permission
to
make
the
vow
big
river
of
the
north
the
saskatchewan
there
was
in
the
camp
a
very
poor
young
man
named
new
robe
so
poor
was
he
that
he
had
never
owned
a
new
robe
nor
a
new
shirt
nor
leggins
nor
even
new
moccasins
his
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
always
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
he
had
worn
nothing
but
the
used
clothes
the
charitable
had
given
him
he
had
never
been
to
war
had
never
done
anything
to
make
a
name
for
himself
but
now
he
was
eager
to
start
in
quest
of
the
missing
boy
he
had
long
loved
the
girl
but
had
never
even
spoken
to
her
he
now
went
to
her
and
said
no
one
about
it
just
silently
pray
for
me
i
am
going
to
travel
far
in
search
of
your
brother
said
the
girl
is
not
a
time
for
me
to
hide
my
heart
from
you
i
have
watched
you
loved
you
for
a
very
long
time
but
what
could
i
say
nothing
well
i
knew
that
my
people
would
not
allow
me
to
marry
one
so
poor
as
you
but
now
there
is
hope
for
us
somehow
i
believe
that
this
trouble
is
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
us
together
and
with
that
she
kissed
him
and
he
went
quietly
out
from
camp
unobserved
by
any
one
and
started
southward
on
his
quest
many
days
later
in
the
valley
of
old
man
river
new
robe
came
upon
an
old
of
the
enemy
crows
of
course
for
that
was
then
their
country
from
it
he
found
that
they
had
moved
south
and
he
followed
their
trail
ever
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
knew
that
he
was
fast
overtaking
them
at
the
he
found
live
coals
in
the
ashes
of
their
abandoned
fireplaces
and
so
upon
arriving
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
overlooking
this
stream
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
lodges
of
the
great
crow
camp
here
right
here
where
we
are
encamped
they
were
set
up
in
a
great
circle
and
in
the
center
of
it
was
a
huge
lodge
covered
with
old
lodge
skins
the
crows
were
having
their
medicine
lodge
ceremonies
mary
river
as
soon
as
night
came
and
before
the
moon
arose
new
robe
descended
the
hill
and
entered
the
camp
the
people
were
all
of
them
gathered
at
the
medicine
lodge
singing
and
dancing
and
fulfilling
their
vows
to
the
sun
so
he
went
from
one
living
lodge
to
another
looking
into
each
for
some
sign
of
the
missing
boy
by
the
time
he
had
made
the
round
of
the
lodges
of
half
of
the
circle
it
was
midnight
and
the
people
were
beginning
to
go
home
to
sleep
he
left
the
camp
and
went
back
on
the
ridge
having
found
no
trace
of
the
one
for
whom
he
searched
the
next
night
new
robe
descended
the
ridge
and
searched
the
lodges
of
the
other
half
of
the
circle
and
found
not
what
he
sought
when
he
had
finished
the
people
were
still
gathered
at
the
medicine
lodge
and
desperate
and
knowing
well
the
great
risk
that
he
would
incur
he
went
toward
it
and
stood
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
great
crowd
and
watched
the
ceremonial
dancing
of
the
different
warrior
clans
he
kept
his
face
partly
concealed
with
his
old
robe
and
moved
from
place
to
place
around
the
outer
circle
of
the
people
and
none
observed
him
so
intent
were
they
upon
watching
the
dancers
at
last
during
a
quiet
interval
between
dances
he
imagined
that
he
heard
some
one
groaning
but
look
where
he
would
he
could
see
no
one
in
distress
nor
could
he
locate
the
exact
place
from
which
the
groaning
came
it
was
a
groaning
such
as
a
child
would
make
he
felt
sure
that
it
came
from
little
lone
star
somewhere
in
that
great
lodge
and
in
great
pain
he
left
the
place
went
outside
the
circle
of
lodges
and
lay
down
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
the
people
returned
to
their
lodges
then
as
soon
as
the
camp
became
quiet
new
robe
returned
to
the
medicine
lodge
and
listening
heard
faint
groaning
and
located
it
it
came
from
the
top
of
the
center
post
where
all
the
sacrifices
to
the
sun
were
hung
he
was
sure
then
that
it
was
no
other
than
lone
star
up
there
lashed
to
the
post
a
living
sacrifice
to
the
sun
and
there
to
die
well
he
knew
that
there
within
the
lodge
were
sleeping
the
women
who
had
vowed
to
build
the
great
structure
in
honor
of
the
sun
and
there
too
in
his
secret
little
inner
lodge
slept
the
medicine
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
drive
back
approaching
thunderclouds
and
rain
he
had
to
risk
awakening
them
he
had
at
least
to
attempt
to
rescue
the
boy
so
casting
off
his
robe
he
climbed
the
outer
wall
of
the
lodge
and
from
it
crawled
along
one
of
the
big
long
poles
that
slanted
up
to
the
center
post
there
he
found
lone
star
firmly
lashed
to
one
of
its
forks
and
so
far
gone
that
he
could
no
longer
even
groan
silently
very
carefully
new
robe
unwound
the
lashing
and
then
fastening
an
end
of
it
under
the
boy
arms
let
him
down
to
the
ground
he
then
descended
and
found
that
the
boy
was
so
numb
that
he
could
not
walk
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
then
he
took
the
helpless
one
upon
his
back
stole
out
of
the
lodge
and
started
with
him
across
the
big
dawn
had
come
as
he
was
passing
the
circle
of
lodges
an
early
riser
a
woman
saw
him
and
with
her
shrieks
aroused
all
the
sleepers
they
rushed
out
warriors
and
youths
the
women
following
and
overtook
him
he
made
no
resistance
he
could
have
left
the
boy
and
made
his
own
escape
but
he
would
not
do
that
several
old
warriors
seized
him
and
the
boy
and
hurried
them
to
the
lodge
of
the
head
chief
the
women
and
the
youths
following
and
crying
out
that
they
be
killed
inside
the
lodge
the
chief
motioned
them
to
seats
and
in
signs
asked
new
robe
what
he
had
to
say
for
himself
came
not
to
harm
you
new
robe
answered
to
take
from
you
anything
that
is
yours
i
came
to
find
this
boy
and
take
him
back
to
his
mourning
father
and
mother
and
sister
and
where
did
i
find
him
tied
to
the
center
post
of
your
medicine
lodge
there
to
die
from
want
of
water
and
food
a
living
but
dying
sacrifice
to
the
sun
that
were
too
cruel
a
thing
to
do
i
ask
you
not
to
put
him
back
there
if
he
is
to
die
i
die
with
him
shoot
us
stab
us
kill
us
in
any
way
you
choose
so
that
our
death
be
quick
the
chief
gave
him
no
answer
to
that
he
counseled
with
the
other
chiefs
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
signed
to
him
are
so
brave
that
we
shall
give
you
and
the
boy
a
chance
for
your
lives
you
are
to
remain
here
in
this
lodge
and
the
following
night
my
young
men
will
keep
watch
on
you
so
do
not
attempt
to
escape
on
the
morning
following
your
second
night
here
you
are
to
be
given
your
chance
to
leave
us
unharmed
i
shall
not
now
tell
you
what
that
chance
will
be
and
then
turning
to
his
men
he
gave
them
certain
orders
and
they
hurried
from
the
lodge
during
the
two
days
and
two
nights
new
robe
prayed
as
he
never
had
before
prayed
for
strength
and
courage
to
succeed
in
whatever
he
should
be
told
to
do
the
people
of
the
lodge
treated
him
and
the
boy
well
they
did
not
want
for
food
nor
anything
else
that
would
make
for
their
comfort
early
in
the
morning
after
the
second
night
the
chief
signed
to
him
is
not
my
fault
nor
the
fault
of
my
under
chiefs
that
you
have
to
undergo
this
trial
for
your
life
and
that
of
the
boy
this
day
my
people
were
crying
for
your
lives
they
wanted
to
drag
you
two
out
from
here
and
fill
your
bodies
with
arrows
i
did
not
want
them
to
do
that
my
council
of
chiefs
did
not
want
it
done
so
we
counseled
together
and
hit
upon
a
way
to
give
you
a
chance
for
your
lives
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
that
you
have
to
attempt
but
i
hope
you
will
succeed
and
whatever
happens
believe
this
i
have
done
the
best
for
you
that
i
could
a
little
later
soon
after
the
morning
meal
the
chief
signed
the
two
captives
to
follow
him
and
led
them
to
the
medicine
lodge
in
front
of
it
were
seven
fresh
buffalo
bull
heads
which
a
number
of
men
were
skinning
and
out
in
front
of
them
in
a
great
were
gathered
every
man
woman
and
child
of
the
mountain
crow
tribe
new
robe
wondered
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
seven
buffalo
heads
he
suspected
that
they
were
to
be
in
some
way
used
in
his
trial
for
life
the
chief
signed
and
led
him
and
the
boy
to
the
entrance
of
the
medicine
lodge
there
they
stood
the
mark
of
many
flashing
angry
eyes
and
presently
the
skinners
finished
their
work
and
an
old
chief
placed
the
shining
skulls
in
a
line
out
from
the
doorway
of
the
lodge
each
one
of
them
a
long
step
distant
from
another
again
the
head
chief
made
signs
to
new
robe
is
your
trial
for
life
he
said
are
to
take
the
boy
on
your
back
and
step
from
one
to
the
other
of
those
skulls
until
you
step
upon
the
last
one
pass
from
it
to
the
ground
if
you
succeed
in
doing
that
you
and
the
boy
are
free
to
go
to
your
home
and
none
of
my
people
shall
harm
you
on
your
way
but
should
you
slip
from
a
skull
and
even
so
much
as
touch
the
ground
with
your
toe
to
save
your
balance
then
the
warriors
standing
out
there
will
fall
upon
you
and
kill
you
both
new
robe
looked
long
at
the
seven
skulls
considering
what
he
should
do
being
freshly
skinned
he
knew
that
they
were
very
slippery
and
then
which
would
be
safest
to
step
slowly
carefully
from
one
to
another
or
make
a
run
across
them
touching
each
one
quickly
lightly
they
were
far
apart
too
far
for
slow
deliberate
stepping
he
concluded
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
start
running
from
the
back
of
the
lodge
and
go
along
the
line
of
them
as
fast
as
he
could
with
his
burden
he
signed
to
the
chief
that
he
would
do
that
and
led
the
boy
to
the
back
of
the
lodge
while
going
there
another
thought
came
to
him
he
got
back
of
the
boy
and
stooped
and
while
pretending
to
fix
the
young
one
belt
and
leggins
kept
spitting
in
two
places
upon
the
ground
he
then
stepped
squarely
in
each
pool
of
the
spit
and
then
upon
soft
ground
and
coated
his
moccasin
soles
with
the
sandy
earth
then
suddenly
swinging
the
boy
to
his
back
and
running
swiftly
across
the
lodge
he
lit
upon
the
first
skull
with
his
right
foot
and
went
leaping
on
from
one
to
another
as
fast
as
he
could
with
the
weight
upon
his
back
the
third
skull
began
to
turn
with
him
and
he
made
a
weak
leap
from
it
barely
alighting
upon
the
next
but
it
held
firm
and
he
made
a
sure
leap
from
it
to
the
next
and
from
that
to
the
next
and
then
stepping
squarely
upon
the
seventh
and
last
skull
passed
from
it
to
the
ground
and
released
the
boy
from
his
back
the
crowd
stood
silent
sullen
watching
him
the
head
chief
came
to
his
side
and
spoke
to
them
and
they
suddenly
broke
out
in
loud
cheers
the
chief
then
signed
to
new
robe
is
one
thing
more
you
are
asked
to
do
before
we
send
you
home
you
do
not
have
to
do
it
but
we
hope
that
you
will
come
with
me
they
went
to
the
lodge
of
a
young
chief
and
when
they
were
seated
the
chief
signed
to
new
robe
father
once
a
great
chief
is
an
old
man
he
does
not
want
to
die
of
old
age
and
long
and
painful
illness
and
he
wants
a
chance
to
kill
one
more
enemy
before
he
dies
he
wants
to
fight
you
if
he
kills
you
then
that
will

anxious
to
loan

what
they
have
you
shall
go
with
me
and
examine
what
they
have
until
you
find
just
what
you
want

considered
the
matter
if
he
won
out
what
honor
what
a
it
would
be
to
return
to
his
people
with
the
weapons
and
the
war
horse
of
his
enemy
if
he
lost
if
he
was
killed
a
sudden
doubt
struck
him
and
he
asked
i
fall
what
will
become
of
the
boy
promise
you
now
the
chiefs
both
answered
in
that
case
some
of
us
will
take
the
boy
to
within
sight
of
the
camp
of
your
people
and
send
him
safely
to
it
take
your
word
for
that
and
now
give
me
weapons
said
new
robe
he
was
offered
his
choice
of
many
bows
and
spears
war
clubs
and
knives
but
took
only
a
short
lithe
bow
and
a
handful
of
arrows
then
standing
within
the
circle
of
the
lodges
he
awaited
the
coming
of
the
old
chief
he
soon
appeared
wearing
a
beautiful
war
costume
and
riding
a
sorrel
pinto
war
horse
and
now
dressed
as
he
was
and
easily
controlling
his
mount
he
did
not
seem
to
be
so
very
old
at
a
distance
one
would
have
thought
him
a
young
warrior
his
weapon
in
hand
was
a
long
spear
on
his
back
he
carried
a
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
and
in
his
belt
in
a
handsome
sheath
was
his
knife
said
new
robe
to
himself
looks
strong
he
is
brave
well
i
too
must
be
brave
and
watchful
forth
and
back
across
the
other
side
of
the
big
circle
rode
the
old
man
singing
a
war
song
brandishing
his
spear
keeping
his
prancing
war
horse
well
in
hand
and
then
suddenly
urging
him
forward
he
came
swift
as
the
wind
at
new
robe
and
he
dropping
his
tattered
wrap
awaited
his
coming
with
ready
bow
on
he
came
shouting
his
war
cry
and
when
quite
close
new

let
fly
his
long
and
arrow
it
struck
the
old
warrior
fair
in
the
ribs
he
flinched
the
mounting
blood
choked
off
his
war
cry
but
on
he
came
and
with
a
last
great
effort
hurled
his
spear
and
fell
from
his
horse
and
died
died
without
knowing
that
the
weapon
had
passed
high
over
new
robe
head
and
then
what
a
shout
went
up
from
all
the
people
shouts
of
honor
for
the
old
chief
who
had
preferred
death
in
battle
instead
of
in
his
lodge
and
shouts
too
for
the
young
man
who
had
so
bravely
faced
him
new
robe
knew
not
what
to
do
he
stood
looking
this
way
that
way
uncertainly
then
came
to
him
the
son
of
the
old
dead
chief
and
signed
to
him
to
take
the
horse
and
the
weapons
of
his
enemy
and
he
did
so
then
the
young
man
brought
to
him
another
horse
a
big
and
gentle
black
said
that
i
would
give
you

signed

of
you
and

without

and

and
more
for

he
was
dead

somehow
faith
that
he
was
alive
that
new

would
find
him
and
bring
him
safely
home
and
at
last
when
she
saw
that
her
father
and
mother
were
likely
to
go
mad
from
grief
she
told
them
that
new

had
gone
in
search
of
the

and
that
she
would
marry
him

if
he
returned

and
watched
the
great
plain
stretching
away
to
the
south
and
all
day
long
and
often
on
her
couch
at
night
prayed
for
the
safe
return
of
brother
and
lover
and
then
at
last
after
many
many
days
of
worried
watching
she
saw
two
riders
coming
from
the
south
across
the
plain
and
sure
that
they
were
those
she
had
been
praying
for
ran
to
meet
them
they
were
the
missing
ones
they
sprang
from
their
fine
horses
and
she
kissed
first
her
brother
and
then
clung
to
new
robe
am
right
now
your
woman
she
cried
and
kissed
him
again
i
am
proud
to
be
your
woman
she
went
on
take
me
up
behind
you
and
we
will
all
ride
home
she
got
up
behind
him
on
his
prancing
war
horse
and
as
they
rode
in
he
quickly
told
her
of
his
adventures
and
how
at
last
he
had
fought
and
killed
the
old
war
chief
and
for
that
had
been
given
the
two
horses
and
all
the
weapons
and
fine
war
clothes
she
saw
so
it
was
that
coming
into
camp
she
had
the
tale
of
his
brave
deeds
to
shout
to
the
people
and
they
gathering
close
around
honored
his
name
and
gave
him
a
chief
greeting
yes
the
poor
orphan
had
within
the
length
of
one
moon
become
a
chief
and
had
made
a
mourning
father
and
mother
happy
that
very
night
he
and
red
cloud
woman
were
given
a
lodge
of
their
own
and
their
happiness
was
complete
iv
the
lakes
inside
mary
lakes
we
left
little
river
on
the
crossed
the
big
ridge
dividing
the
arctic
and
the
atlantic
waters
and
made
camp
here
on
the
big
prairie
at
the
foot
of
the
upper
mary
lake
in
the
old
days
this
great
valley
hemmed
in
by
gigantic
mountains
was
my
favorite
hunting
ground
after
the
buffalo
were
exterminated
and
there
was
no
more
sport
to
be
had
upon
the
plains
illustration
camp
near
lower
end
of
upper
mary
lake
hugh
monroe
or
rising
wolf
was
of
course
the
first
white
man
to
see
these
most
beautiful
of
all
our
northern
rockies
lakes
with
the
piegan
blackfeet
he
camped
at
them
in
and
long
afterward
with
his
growing
family
of
hardy
sons
and
daughters
this
became
his
favorite
hunting
and
trapping
ground
when
in
the
that
valiant
and
much
beloved
missionary
father
de
smet
was
visiting
the
various
tribes
of
this
northwest
country
monroe
was
engaged
to
take
him
to
a
conference
with
the
north
blackfeet
then
camping
on
the
saskatchewan
river
they
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
lower
of
these
lakes
and
there
erected
a
large
wooden
cross
and
named
the
two
sheets
of
water
mary
lakes
later
on
the
stevens
expedition
named
them
chief
mountain
lakes
but
that
name
did
not
last
monroe
and
his
brother
trappers
were
all
catholics
and
they
continued
to
use
the
name
that
the
great
priest
had
given
them
and
on
the
maps
they
are
mary
lakes
during
my
long
friendship
with
him
monroe
told
me
many
stories
of
his
adventures
here
in
early
days
this
was
his
favorite
mountain
resort
on
account
of
the
great
numbers
of
moose
that
inhabited
the
heavily
timbered
valley
and
mountain
slopes
and
of
the
great
variety
and
numbers
of
fur
animals
that
were
found
here
the
valley
swarmed
with
elk
and
deer
there
were
countless
flocks
of
bighorn
and
goats
on
the
mountains
and
herds
of
buffalo
everywhere
along
the
lower
lake
and
below
it
but
monroe
liked
best
of
all
the
flesh
of
moose
and
killed
large
numbers
of
them
every
season
that
he
camped
here
his
method
of
catching
wolves
was
simple
and
unique
he
would
build
an
oblong
pyramidal
log
pen
about
eight
by
sixteen
feet
at
the
base
and
eight
feet
in
height
the
last
layer
of
logs
being
placed
about
eighteen
inches
apart
easily
climbing
the
slope
of
this
the
wolves
would
jump
down
through
the
narrow
aperture
at
the
top
to
feed
upon
the
quantities
of
meat
that
had
been
placed
inside
to
decoy
them
but
they
could
not
jump
out
often
of
a
morning
the
trapper
and
his
sons
would
find
ten
or
more
big
wolves
imprisoned
in
the
trap
and
powder
and
ball
being
very
costly
they
would
kill
them
with
bow
and
arrows
skin
them
and
drag
the
carcasses
to
the
river
and
cast
them
into
it
then
take
the
hides
home
and
peg
them
on
the
ground
to
dry
in
this
manner
they
would
often
in
the
spring
have
several
hundred
wolf
pelts
to
pack
in
to
fort
benton
for
sale
and
prime
pelts
sold
at
five
dollars
each
in
trade
their
catch
of
beaver
otter
mink
martin
and
fisher
was
also
large
monroe
always
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
lower
lake
near
the
outlet
and
was
there
more
than
once
attacked
by
roving
war
parties
of
assiniboines
crows
and
even
the
yanktonais
the
horses
were
kept
at
night
in
a
strong
corral
just
back
of
the
lodge
and
in
the
daytime
were
watched
by
some
member
of
the
family
while
they
grazed
on
the
rich
prairie
grasses
all
the
family
john
and
fran√ßois
the
sons
millie
and
lizzie
the
daughters
and
even
the
mother
had
guns
flintlocks
and
a
good
supply
of
powder
and
ball
early
one
morning
a
large
war
party
was
discovered
approaching
the
camp
sneaking
from
bush
to
bush
some
crawling
on
all
fours
through
the
high
grass
lizzie
opened
fire
upon
them
and
killed
her
man
and
then
the
fire
became
general
on
both
sides
but
the
monroes
in
their
trenches
surrounding
the
lodge
had
the
best
of
it
from
the
start
and
eventually
made
the
enemy
retreat
with
a
loss
of
five
of
their
number
late
the
following
night
the
assiniboines
crept
in
to
make
another
attack
but
the
monroes
were
expecting
them
waiting
for
them
and
in
the
bright
moonlight
could
take
fairly
accurate
aim
they
again
drove
them
off
with
a
loss
of
two
more
of
their
number
and
that
time
they
kept
going
nothing
more
was
seen
of
them
but
for
some
days
the
monroes
did
not
venture
far
from
their
camp
i
first
saw
the
mary
lakes
in
october
in
company
with
charles
phemmister
james
rutherford
charles
carter
and
oliver
sanderville
all
old
plainsmen
good
company
and
best
of
hunters
we
outfitted
for
the
trip
at
the
old
agency
on
badger
creek
blackfeet
reservation
and
started
northward
there
was
no
trail
after
leaving
the
crossing
of
little
or
milk
river
and
we
struck
up
country
toward
the
big
gap
in
the
mountains
in
which
we
knew
the
lakes
must
lie
and
that
evening
camped
on
the
shore
of
a
large
prairie
lake
that
was
black
with
ducks
i
shot
a
dozen
or
more
of
them
as
they
flew
over
a
long
point
and
to
my
surprise
and
delight
found
that
they
were
all
canvasbacks
and
redheads
and
very
fat
from
feeding
upon
the
wild
celery
beds
of
the
lake
i
named
the
sheet
of
water
duck
lake
the
next
day
we
made
a
trail
down
the
long
hill
and
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
lower
lake
close
to
the
outlet
then
began
two
weeks
of
most
glorious
sport
we
shot
elk
deer
and
several
grizzlies
in
the
valley
and
bighorn
on
a
mountain
that
i
named
flat
top
and
combed
that
mountain
from
one
end
to
another
and
on
all
sides
for
an
animal
known
to
us
as
the
rocky
mountain
ibex
we
had
seen
several
skins
of
them
bought
from
the
stony
indians
by
captain
john
healy
of
fort
whoopup
and
fort
benton
fame
but
none
of
us
nor
any
man
of
our
acquaintance
and
we
knew
every
trapper
and
trader
in
the
country
had
ever
seen
one
of
the
animals
alive
of
course
we
found
none
as
this
animal
which
we
later
learned
is
a
true
antelope
and
not
an
ibex
or
goat
seldom
leaves
the
high
cliff
mountains
for
the
outer
and
lower
ones
of
the
range
when
later
we
did
find
them
we
in
our
ignorance
named
them
rocky
mountain
goats
and
that
is
the
common
name
for
them
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
antelopes
on
this
first
visit
to
the
mary
lakes
country
i
was
so
impressed
by
the
grandeur
of
its
mountains
the
beauty
of
its
many
lakes
and
its
plenitude
of
game
that
thereafter
for
many
years
it
was
more
than
anywhere
else
my
home
in
i
brought
out
to
the
lakes
a
good
boat
that
i
had
had
built
for
me
at
fort
conrad
and
with
it
learned
that
both
lakes
were
alive
with
whitefish
and
mackinaw
dolly
varden
and
cutthroat
trout
during
the
summer
of
this
year
i
named
red
eagle
mountain
and
red
eagle
lake
after
my
red
eagle
owner
of
the
thunder
medicine
pipe
and
one
of
the
most
indians
that
i
ever
knew
in
the
autumn
of
this
year
george
bird
grinnell
joined
me
and
we
hunted
around
the
lower
lake
and
went
up
swift
current
far
enough
to
see
what
we
thought
would
possibly
prove
to
be
a
glacier
we
had
not
then
time
to
learn
if
our
surmise
was
correct
during
our
hunt
grinnell
killed
a
large
ram
at
long
range
offhand
with
one
shot
from
his
old
rifle
on
the
mountain
next
above
flat
top
and
i
therefore
named
it
mountain
illustration
at
the
narrows
upper
mary
lake
in
the
summer
of
this
year
i
also
named
divide
mountain
because
it
is
the
outermost
mountain
on
the
watershed
at
the
same
time
i
named
kootenai
mountain
also
for
a
very
good
reason
some
members
of
that
tribe
were
encamped
beside
me
at
the
foot
of
the
upper
lake
i
noticed
often
that
they
would
ride
out
of
camp
at
daylight
and
return
at
noon
or
a
little
later
with
all
the
bighorn
or
goat
meat
that
their
horses
could
carry
and
finally
i
asked
them
where
they
went
to
make
their
killings
so
quickly
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
something
one
of
them
answered
and
the
next
morning
i
rode
with
him
up
red
eagle
valley
and
part
way
up
a
mountain
where
we
tied
our
horses
and
went
on
afoot
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
then
looking
down
into
a
we
saw
a
dozen
or
more
bighorn
in
the
bottom
of
it
and
killed
four
of
them
they
had
been
eating
salty
clay
and
drinking
from
a
salt
spring
that
oozes
from
the
ground
there
so
i
named
the
place
kootenai
lick
and
also
gave
the
mountain
the
name
kootenai
thereafter
i
knew
where
to
go
for
bighorn
when
i
wanted
one
in
i
named
mountain
after
one
of
the
few
survivors
of
the
baker
massacre
which
took
place
on
the
marias
river
january
at
that
time
colonel
baker
with
a
couple
of
companies
of
cavalry
from
fort
shaw
montana
was
trying
to
find
the
camp
of
owl
child
a
piegan
blackfoot
and
murderer
of
a
settler
named
malcolm
clark
and
arrest
him
by
mistake
he
struck
the
camp
of
heavy
runner
and
his
band
of
friendly
indians
and
although
the
chief
came
running
toward
him
waving
his
letters
of
recommendation
and
his
washington
medals
baker
ordered
his
men
to
begin
firing
and
a
terrible
massacre
ensued
the
indians
firing
not
one
shot
in
defense
as
about
all
the
men
were
at
the
time
on
a
buffalo
hunt
when
the
firing
was
over
two
hundred
and
seventeen
old
men
and
women
and
children
lay
dead
and
dying
in
their
lodges
and
in
the
camp
the
soldiers
then
shot
the
wounded
collected
the
lodges
and
property
of
the
indians
in
great
piles
and
set
fire
to
them
and
departed
the
above
is
an
extract
from
an
affidavit
by
the
late
joseph
kipp
who
was
baker
scout
and
guide
at
the
time
in
the
autumn
of
grinnell
j
monroe
and
i
made
a
trip
up
swift
current
river
and
discovered
and
roughly
measured
the
big
glacier
at
the
head
of
its
middle
fork
grinnell
killing
a
big
ram
on
the
ice
while
we
were
traversing
it
and
avoiding
its
deep
crevasses
that
evening
monroe
and
i
named
the
glacier
in
honor
of
grinnell
and
also
named
the
mountain
to
the
north
of
it
after
him
on
the
following
day
we
were
joined
by
lieutenant
now
major
beacom
third
infantry
and
he
gave
my
indian
name
apikuni
to
the
high
mountain
between
swift
current
and
the
south
fork
of
kennedy
creek
upon
our
return
to
upper
mary
lake
grinnell
named
little
chief
mountain
monroe
gave
citadel
mountain
its
name
and
i
named
yellow
fish
goat
and
four
bears
mountains
yellow
fish
was
an
indian
who
often
hunted
with
us
and
four
bears
was
the
blackfeet
camp
crier
and
a
most
amusing
man
it
was
in
i
believe
that
we
three
and
my
friend
william
jackson
scout
for
general
custer
and
general
miles
cut
a
trail
to
the
head
of
the
mary
valley
and
discovered
the
great
sheet
of
ice
which
we
named
the
blackfeet
glacier
we
at
the
same
time
named
pass
and
named
the
peak
just
west
of
the
glacier
mount
jackson
it
should
be
blackfeet
man
jackson
indian
name
he
was
a
grandson
of
hugh
monroe
a
real
plainsman
and
one
of
the
bravest
men
i
ever
knew
illustration
mountain
has
been
climbed
this
day
and
a
flag
has
been
planted
upon
its
summit
by
paul
walker
of
topeka
kansas
owing
to
a
high
cliff
upon
its
upper
shoulder
the
mountain
has
always
been
considered
unclimbable
but
after
long
search
and
with
no
little
risk
walker
finally
worked
out
a
way
up
the
wall
and
out
upon
the
extreme
crest
and
was
undoubtedly
the
first
man
white
or
red
ever
to
stand
there
he
reports
that
a
magnificent
view
of
the
mountains
and
plains
is
to
be
had
from
the
great
height
we
have
more
real
meat
in
camp
yesterday
black
bull
went
up
under
the
north
point
of
flat
top
mountain
which
is
on
the
indian
reservation
and
killed
two
fat
young
rams
i
went
fishing
and
in
the
first
pool
of
the
river
below
the
upper
lake
caught
several
and
cutthroat
trout
we
had
a
great
feast
in
the
evening
roast
bighorn
ribs
broiled
trout
a
quantity
of
blueberries
and
so
on
after
the
feast
was
over
came
time
and
we
heard
this
man
and
that
man
experiences
in
hunting
in
this
vicinity
in
other
days
relating
a
hard
experience
that
befell
him
when
once
wintering
here
with
me
he
was
chasing
a
wounded
elk
on
the
slope
of
mountain
and
stepped
upon
a
sharp
knot
that
pierced
his
foot
through
and
through
and
kept
him
laid
up
for
two
months
yellow
wolf
then
related
an
tale
which
incidentally
gave
the
reason
for
naming
these
two
sheets
of
water
the
inside
lakes
he
called
it
he
said
the
story
of
the
first
horses
in
that
time
when
the
people
had
only
their
great
dogs
for
carrying
their
belongings
there
were
two
very
poor
orphans
a
brother
and
sister
in
the
camp
the
boy
was
very
deaf
and
because
he
seemed
not
to
understand
what
was
shouted
at
him
he
was
believed
to
be
crazy
and
not
even
the
relatives
of
his
dead
father
and
mother
cared
to
have
him
in
their
lodges
one
would
keep
him
for
a
time
and
tell
him
to
go
and
then
another
relative
would
take
him
in
for
a
short
time
and
getting
tired
of
him
send
him
on
to
another
lodge
and
wherever
he
went
his
beautiful
young
sister
went
with
him
often
in
good
weather
when
camp
was
moved
the
two
would
stay
at
the
old
living
on
meat
so
long
as
it
lasted
and
then
they
would
overtake
the
camp
and
go
into
the
nearest
lodge
and
at
least
be
sure
of
a
meal
they
were
generally
barefooted
and
always
shabbily
dressed
it
was
a
hard
life
that
they
led
and
because
he
was
so
deaf
and
believed
to
be
crazy
the
boy
had
not
even
one
playmate
in
all
the
camp
nor
had
his
sister
for
she
knew
that
it
was
her
duty
to
be
always
at
his
side
there
came
a
time
however
when
a
childless
woman
wife
of
a
great
and
rich
chief
wanted
the
girl
to
raise
as
her
own
daughter
and
after
many
days
the
boy
persuaded
her
to
be
adopted
and
he
was
left
alone
and
more
lonely
than
ever
not
long
after
this
separation
the
camp
moved
one
day
and
the
boy
long
arrow
remained
at
the
old
to
live
there
as
long
as
he
could
on
the
leavings
of
the
people
at
last
he
finished
the
last
scrap
of
thrown
away
or
forgotten
meat
and
started
to
overtake
the
camp
the
day
was
hot
terribly
hot
but
despite
that
the
boy
traveled
as
fast
as
he
could
often
running
and
perspiration
streamed
from
his
body
and
his
breath
came
short
and
fast
in
loud
wheezes
suddenly
while
running
he
felt
something
give
way
with
a
snap
in
his
left
ear
felt
something
moving
out
from
it
and
reaching
up
he
pulled
from
it
a
long
round
waxy
object
that
looked
like
a
worm
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
ran
on
and
noted
that
with
the
left
ear
he
could
plainly
hear
his
footsteps
upon
the
trail
a
little
later
something
snapped
in
his
right
ear
and
began
to
move
out
of
it
and
he
took
from
it
another
substance
and
keeping
both
in
his
hand
ran
on
he
could
now
hear
plainly
with
both
ears
and
so
happy
was
he
that
he
felt
almost
as
though
he
could
fly
but
that
was
not
all
the
good
that
was
to
come
to
him
that
day
early
in
the
morning
a
hunter
had
left
camp
with
his
pack
dogs
and
had
taken
the
back
trail
in
search
of
buffalo
and
just
before
the
boy
appeared
he
had
killed
one
and
was
butchering
it
when
he
saw
the
boy
approaching
him
this
hunter
heavy
runner
was
a
chief
and
one
of
the
kindest
men
in
the
whole
camp
he
had
long
thought
to
do
something
for
this
boy
and
now
when
he
saw
him
coming
he
said
to
himself
time
has
come
i
shall
do
something
for
him
the
boy
came
to
him
and
his
kill
and
he
shouted
to
him
at
the
same
time
making
signs
you
down
my
boy
and
rest
you
are
wet
with
sweat
and
covered
with
dust
you
must
be
very
tired
take
this
piece
of
tripe
and
eat
it
and
now
let
me
tell
you
something
from
this
day
you
are
to
be
my
boy
i
adopt
you
you
shall
have
a
place
in
my
lodge
good
clothes
a
good
bed
try
to
be
good
and
deserve
it
all
i
am
going
to
try
to
make
a
man
of
you
runner
your
kind
words
make
me
want
to
cry
said
the
boy
his
voice
trembling
tears
dropping
from
his
eyes
he
swallowed
painfully
brushed
away
the
tears
sat
up
straight
and
went
on
shall
be
glad
to
be
your
son
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
to
deserve
what
you
give
me
and
now
let
me
tell
you
something
as
i
was
running
away
back
there
on
the
trail
and
breathing
hard
first
in
one
ear
and
then
in
the
other
something
broke
with
a
snapping
noise
and
out
came
these
two
things
and
at
once
hearing
came
to
me
i
believe
that
i
could
hear
a
mouse
walking
if
he
were
away
out
there
beyond
your
kill
that
is
good
news
and
a
good
sign
heavy
runner
shouted
he
was
not
yet
used
to
the
fact
that
the
boy
could
hear
then
remembering
he
said
more
gently
take
a
good
rest
while
i
finish
butchering
this
animal
and
packing
the
dogs
and
then
we
will
each
take
what
meat
we
can
carry
and
go
home
yes
boy
you
have
a
home
now
and
a
good
one
that
evening
when
heavy
runner
told
his
woman
that
he
had
adopted
long
arrow
she
made
a
great
outcry
could
you
and
without
asking
me
adopt
that
deaf
crazy
boy
she
asked
and
then
she
cried
and
said
that
she
would
not
have
him
for
a
son
and
ran
from
the
lodge
people
gathered
around
and
pitied
her
and
said
that
she
was
right
that
the
boy
was
crazy
and
deaf
and
worthless
and
would
not
mind
and
as
soon
as
he
got
good
clothes
he
would
run
off
and
again
live
at
old
campgrounds
after
a
time
she
went
back
to
her
lodge
and
as
soon
as
she
entered
it
heavy
runner
said
to
her
at
once
cease
your
crying
and
take
the
anger
from
your
heart
i
have
adopted
this
boy
and
he
is
my
boy
he
is
no
longer
deaf
he
was
never
crazy
he
is
a
good
boy
and
i
shall
make
a
man
a
chief
of
him
see
that
you
treat
him
well
even
if
you
can
not
love
him
and
believe
this
if
you
do
not
treat
him
well
you
shall
be
the
one
to
suffer
morning
begin
making
some
good
moccasins
for
him
i
myself
shall
cut
out
his
clothes
and
he
can
sew
them
so
began
a
new
life
for
long
arrow
if
the
woman
did
not
love
him
she
at
least
treated
him
well
he
did
everything
that
he
could
think
of
to
please
heavy
runner
he
went
hunting
with
him
and
brought
home
heavy
loads
of
the
meat
that
he
killed
and
in
every
possible
way
was
of
use
to
him
and
yet
he
was
not
satisfied
he
kept
saying
to
himself
want
to
do
something
great
for
this
man
who
is
so
good
to
me
time
passed
the
boy
grew
up
to
be
a
fine
young
man
good
of
heart
and
of
fine
appearance
and
at
last
heavy
runner
woman
loved
him
as
though
he
were
her
own
son
but
in
one
thing
he
was
very
different
from
the
other
young
men
of
the
camp
he
made
no
close
friends
and
when
not
needed
by
heavy
runner
he
wandered
much
by
himself
excepting
his
sister
whom
he
frequently
took
for
long
walks
he
had
little
to
say
to
any
one
and
so
the
people
all
but
she
and
his
foster
parents
continued
to
believe
him
crazy
one
evening
he
said
to
heavy
runner
me
what
must
one
do
to
become
a
chief
must
be
very
brave
must
be
fearless
when
facing
the
enemy
and
of
very
kind
heart
full
of
pity
for
the
poor
and
the
old
and
the
sick
and
always
anxious
to
help
them
the
chief
replied
i
want
to
become
a
chief
what
is
the
first
thing
for
me
to
do
he
asked
first
thing
to
do
is
to
go
to
some
far
and
dangerous
place
and
get
your
medicine
that
is
something
that
will
make
you
favored
by
the
gods
and
bring
you
good
luck
in
battle
and
in
all
matters
of
life
heavy
runner
told
him
i
shall
do
said
the
young
man
first
will
you
not
call
in
the
chiefs
and
the
medicine
men
and
braves
and
let
me
hear
from
them
where
they
went
and
what
they
did
to
get
their
medicine
i
shall
then
have
a
better
idea
of
what
i
am
to
do
will
have
in
our
lodge
full
of
them
heavy
runner
said
and
the
next
morning
he
shouted
out
invitations
for
a
smoke
asking
only
the
great
of
the
tribe
to
come
to
it
they
came
filling
the
lodge
and
then
when
the
pipe
was
going
the
round
of
the
circle
he
told
why
he
had
invited
them
to
the
smoke
asked
them
to
give
their
experiences
in
their
search
for
medicines
one
after
another
they
told
their
adventures
where
they
went
what
they
did
what
they
saw
what
narrow
escapes
from
death
they
had
and
at
last
it
came
spotted
bear
turn
but
he
refused
to
give
his
experience
he
cried
that
crazy
youth
about
my
adventure
why
i
would
waste
my
breath
on
him
he
is
a
poor
boy
he
wants
to
know
you
might
tell
it
him
in
a
short
way
pleaded
heavy
runner
i
will
tell
it
not
for
his
benefit
for
he
is
crazy
and
would
not
understand
but
i
will
tell
it
so
that
you
all
may
know
what
i
did
the
surly
one
answered
this
very
place
i
traveled
southward
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
seven
days
and
seven
nights
i
traveled
stopping
only
now
and
then
for
a
short
rest
and
sleeping
very
little
and
on
the
morning
after
the
seventh
night
i
arrived
at
the
shore
of
a
small
lake
there
i
met
a
stranger
man
who
asked
me
what
i
sought
and
i
told
him
that
i
was
wandering
in
search
of
a
strong
a
powerful
medicine

he
in
such
a
matter

and
three
nights
and
you

a
man
who

went
on
stopping
only
for
short
rests
and
rarely

i
traveled
south
for
three
days
and
three
nights
from
that
place
and
in
the
morning
after
the
third
night
arrived
at
a
long
wide
lake
running
away
back
in
the
mountains
i
looked
at
it
looked
at
the
mountains
turning
this
way
that
way
and
when
i
turned
a
last
time
lo
there
in
front
of
me
stood
a
man
fierce
of
face
dressed
in
beautiful
strange
clothing
wrapped
in
a
robe
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
and
carrying
a
spear
with
a
big
flint
point

he
asked

not
afraid
to
come
to
this
the
home
of

deep
waters
answered
that
i
was
not
afraid
that
i
feared
neither
gods
nor
men
nor
any
animal
of
the
earth
the
sky
or
the
deep
waters
and
at
that
he
cried

me

him
to
his
lodge

this
robe

and
taught
me
the
prayers
and
ceremony
that
goes
with
it
i
asked
him
what
kind
of
a
robe
it
was
and
he
answered
that
it
was
the
skin
of
an
an
animal
as
large
as
an
elk
and
like
the
dog
useful
for
carrying
burdens

is
proof
of
all
that
i
have
told
you
ah
and
this
crazy
youth
would

where
i
went
what
i
did
it
is
to
laugh
to
think
of
his
going
there
the
pipe
went
a
last
round
and
then
the
chiefs
and
medicine
men
and
braves
went
home
as
soon
as
they
were
gone

many
dangers

i
will

at
break
of
day
the
next
morning
while
all
the
people
of
the
great
camp
still
slept
long
arrow
started
on
his
journey
of
discovery
straight
south
he
went
by
day
and
by
night
resting
and
sleeping
at
long
intervals
and
then
only
for
a
very
short
time
on
the
third
day
he
arrived
at
the
small
lake
that
spotted
bear
had
mentioned
and
there
met
the
man
of
that
place
even
as
he
had
done

you
the
man
asked
medicine
the
way
to
become
a
chief
long

not
help
you
go
on
south
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
you
will
come
to
a
great
lake
and
there
you
will
meet
a
man
who
can
help
you
if
he
cares
to
do
so
it
may
be
that
he
will
not
even
show
himself
to
you
but
anyhow
it
is
worth
your
while
to
go
there
and
try
to
meet
him
long
arrow
went
on
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
resting
and
sleeping
less
than
ever
eating
nothing
except
now
and
then
a
piece
of
dry
meat
not
so
large
as
his
hand
early
in
the
morning
after
the
seventh
night
exhausted
hardly
able
to
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
he
came
to
the
great
lake
and
some
distance
back
from
its
shore
fell
down
on
the
grass
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
it
was
late
afternoon
when
he
awoke
and
opening
his
eyes
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
boy
standing
beside
him
he
was
a
beautiful
child
by
far
the
most
perfect
of
form
and
feature
that
long
arrow
had
ever
seen
so
beautiful
that
it
did
not
seem
possible
he
could
be
of
this
earth
a
child
of
the
people
of
this
earth
said
the
boy
to
him
have
been
waiting
here
a
long
time
for
you
to
awake
my
father
invites
you
to
his
home
shall
be
glad
to
visit
him
long
arrow
answered
and
sprang
up
put
on
his
weapons
and
was
ready
the
boy
led
him
straight
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
there
cried
out
not
be
afraid
follow
me
and
having
said
that
changed
into
a
snipe
entered
the
water
and
disappeared
long
arrow
was
afraid
terribly
afraid
of
the
deep
dark
water
and
the
mystery
of
a
place
where
a
child
could
suddenly
become
a
snipe
but
he
said
to
himself
i
fail
in
my
search
for
a
medicine
it
shall
be
through
no
fault
of
mine
and
he
entered
the
water
lo
it
did
not
wet
him
did
not
touch
him
it
parted
before
him
and
he
went
on
down
the
sloping
sandy
bottom
of
the
lake
and
soon
saw
close
ahead
a
large
fine
lodge
on
which
were
painted
in
red
and
black
the
figures
of
two
strange
animals
the
boy
arrived
at
the
doorway
of
the
lodge
changed
suddenly
from
a
snipe
back
to
his
natural
self
and
cried
out
me
here
you
will
be
welcome
and
went
in
long
arrow
following
him
found
himself
facing
a
man
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
he
was
sitting
on
his
couch
and
wore
a
beautiful
black
robe
which
entirely
covered
his
legs
and
feet
are
welcome
here
my
son
be
seated
said
the
man
and
told
his
wife
to
prepare
food
for
his
guest
long
arrow
looked
about
him
on
all
sides
the
lodge
was
hung
with
beautiful
shields
war
clothes
weapons
handsomely
painted
and
fringed
pouches
of
sacred
medicines
and
a
embroidered
belt
of
such
brilliant
colors
that
it
shamed
the
rainbow
the
woman
of
the
lodge
soon
set
food
before
long
arrow
and
having
long
fasted
he
ate
largely
the
man
then
filled
and
lighted
a
pipe
passed
it
to
his
guest
and
said
knew
that
you
were
coming
and
i
wondered
if
you
would
have
the
courage
to
follow
my
son
from
the
shore
of
this
lake
down
here
to
my
lodge
not
long
ago
a
man
of
your
people
came
here
but
he
was
afraid
he
would
not
follow
my
son
and
there
he
made
a
great
mistake
i
was
going
to
give
him
the
most
valuable
present
ever
given
by
gods
to
men
as
it
was
i
went
out
to
him
where
he
sat
far
back
from
the
shore
and
gave
him
the
tanned
hide
of
an
and
sent
him
home
he
was
not
worthy
of
a
better

present
the
boy
went
out
with
long
arrow
and
showed
him
the
they
came
running
from
the
timber
out
upon
the
open
prairie
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
and
were
a
wonderful
sight
they
were
far
larger
than
an
elk
of
shining
black
color
had
tails
of
long
hair
and
there
was
long
hair
all
along
the
top
of
their
necks
and
hanging
down
their
foreheads
from
between
their
restless
ears
they
were
of
all
sizes
from
suckling
young
to
old
males
and
females
and
all
were
very
fat
and
playful
even
the
oldest
of
them
man
of
the
earth
said
the
boy
you
are
wise
and
watchful
these
animals
and
my
father
black
robe
and
his
belt
may
be
your
present
the
three
go
together
you
have
noticed
that
my
father
always
keeps
his
feet
covered
with
the
black
robe
that
when
he
arises
and
goes
out
of
the
lodge
he
is
very
careful
to
keep
the
robe
lowered
around
him
like
a
dragging
woman
dress
so
that
his
feet
can
not
be
seen
well
you
have
but
to
see
those
feet
and
anything
that
you
ask
for
will
be
yours
shall
do
my
best
to
see
those
feet
said
long
arrow
several
days
passed
the
old
people
of
the
lodge
were
very
kind
to
long
arrow
and
he
in
turn
did
his
best
to
please
them
hunting
most
all
of
the
time
and
bringing
in
much
meat
and
what
time
he
was
not
hunting
he
would
sit
close
to
the
herd
of
beautiful
and
watch
them
feed
and
play
when
in
the
lodge
he
watched
closely
for
a
sight
of
the
old
man
feet
but
he
ever
kept
them
closely
covered
at
last
one
evening
the
old
man
started
to
go
out
of
the
lodge
keeping
his
robe
well
down
upon
the
ground
about
him
but
as
he
stepped
over
the
low
front
of
the
doorway
his
right
knee
raised
the
robe
and
long
arrow
saw
his
left
foot
and
lo
it
was
not
a
human
foot
it
was
the
hoof
the
round
hard
hoof
of
an
he
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
at
the
sight
and
the
old
man
realizing
what
had
happened
exclaimed
how
careless
of
me
well
it
can
not
be
helped
it
must
have
been
fated
that
he
should
see
it
he
went
on
out
and
upon
returning
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
feet
both
of
them
and
the
ankles
were
those
of
the
you
have
seen
my
feet
so
you
can
now
tell
me
what
i
shall
give
you
said
the
old
man
as
he
resumed
his
seat
do
hesitate
speak
right
out
ask
for
the
three
things
whispered
the
boy
and
long
arrow
taking
courage
answered
me
three
things
your
black
robe
your
belt
and
your
you
ask
a
great
deal
the
old
man
cried
because
you
are
brave
and
and
not
lazy
you
shall
have
the
robe
and
the
belt
and
a
part
of
my
band
of
the
robe
and
the
belt
are
the
medicine
without
them
you
could
never
catch
and
use
the
animals
there
are
many
prayers
and
songs
and
a
long
ceremony
that
go
with
them
and
i
have
to
teach
it
all
to
you
when
you
have
thoroughly
learned
them
then
you
shall
go
home
with
your
presents
long
arrow
was
many
evenings
learning
them
all
but
at
last
he
could
repeat
every
one
of
them
perfectly
and
dance
the
dances
as
well
as
the
old
man
himself
and
finally
the
latter
told
him
one
evening
have
done
well
i
am
glad
that
my
and
my
medicines
are
to
be
in
your
hands
you
may
start
for
home
and
now
listen
take
good
heed
of
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
you
leave
here
wearing
the
black
robe
and
the
belt
you
are
to
travel
for
three
days
and
three
nights
and
never
once
look
back
when
you
rest
you
are
to
face
the
north
be
sure
now
that
traveling
or
resting
you
never
once
look
back
the
will
not
at
first
follow
you
but
on
the
third
day
of
your
homeward
journey
you
will
hear
them
coming
behind
you
even
then
you
must
not
look
back
but
keep
on
walking
after
a
time
they
will
come
on
right
beside
you
and
with
a
rope
that
i
shall
give
you
you
will
catch
one
of
them
and
mount
and
ride
it
and
all
the
others
will
follow
you
they
will
always
do
that
so
long
as
you
have
the
black
robe
lose
that
and
you
lose
your
animals
they
will
become
wild
and
you
will
never
be
able
to
catch
and
train
them
you
say
so
shall
i
do
long
arrow
answered
and
early
the
next
morning
the
old
man
gave
him
the
robe
the
belt
and
a
rope
made
from
the
head
hair
of
buffalo
bulls
and
he
started
for
home
keeping
ever
in
mind
and
obeying
carefully
the
old
instructions
at
times
he
had
his
doubts
of
the
old
man
perhaps
a
big
joke
was
being
played
upon
him
the
would
not
come
on
the
third
day
nor
any
other
day
but
he
would
soon
cast
off
such
thoughts
and
go
on
with
renewed
faith
that
all
would
be
well
with
him
and
on
the
third
day
he
heard
behind
him
the
thunder
of
many
hard
hoofs
upon
the
hard
plain
the
occasional
whinnying
that
he
had
learned
to
love
so
well
and
then
an
old
female
leading
them
the
came
close
up
beside
him
and
he
caught
and
mounted
one
of
them
and
rode
on
how
happy
he
was
he
realized
what
this
would
mean
for
himself
and
for
the
people
these
would
rapidly
increase
in
number
there
would
soon
be
enough
of
them
for
all
the
people
and
then
they
would
ride
instead
of
walk
and
their
lodges
and
all
their
belongings
would
be
carried
by
the
animals
now
i
can
do
something
for
those
who
have
been
so
good
to
me
he
said
to
himself
and
rode
on
singing
the
new
songs
that
he
had
learned
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
on
the
day
that
he
approached
the
camp
all
the
men
had
returned
from
the
hunt
every
one
was
outside
the
lodges
resting
in
the
warm
sunshine
the
first
to
discover
him
gave
a
shout
of
surprise
and
alarm
all
the
people
sprang
up
and
stood
gazing
at
the
strange
sight
they
asked
one
another
what
the
strange
big
black
animals
could
be
and
was
it
really
a
man
sitting
astride
one
of
them
is
some
fierce
god
bringing
his
fierce
animals
to
destroy
us
shouted
spotted
bear
the
very
man
who
had
so
contemptuously
used
long
arrow
who
had
not
had
the
courage
to
follow
the
into
the
water
again
he
cried
out
it
is
an
evil
one
coming
to
destroy
us
and
he
fled
and
all
the
people
fled
with
him
and
took
to
the
brush
long
arrow
rode
into
camp
and
dismounted
at
heavy
runner
lodge
and
all
the
came
up
and
crowded
around
him
and
the
one
of
them
that
he
had
been
riding
runner
heavy
runner
he
shouted
not
afraid
i
am
only
your
son
come
back
to
you
heavy
runner
heard
the
voice
and
was
no
longer
afraid
he
came
hurrying
from
the
brush
all
the
people
following
him
and
they
all
crowded
around
long
arrow
and
his
strange
animals
said
the
youth
then
father
and
mother
that
i
ever
knew
i
have
brought
to
you
excepting
one
female
and
one
male
all
these
strange
and
useful
animals
as
you
see
they
can
be
ridden
you
will
no
longer
have
to
walk
also
they
will
carry
for
you
everything
that
is
yours
i
am
glad
that
i
can
give
them
to
you
both
of
you
who
have
been
so
good
to
me
generous
of
you
heavy
runner
cried
but
his
wife
could
say
nothing
she
embraced
long
arrow
and
wept
did
you
get
the
strange
black
ones
a
chief
asked
will
tell
you
all
about
it
this
evening
i
am
cautioned
not
to
talk
about
the
gods
in
the
daytime
long
arrow
answered
and
after
picketing
the
animal
he
had
ridden
on
good
grass
and
driving
the
others
out
from
camp
he
went
into
the
lodge
and
rested
illustration
chalet
upper
mary
lake
that
evening
all
the
chiefs
and
warriors
came
into
the
lodge
spotted
bear
with
them
and
he
told
all
about
his
strange
adventures
of
his
life
with
the
people
and
how
the
old
man
had
given
him
the
and
the
black
robe
and
the
belt
that
he
wore
and
of
course
he
told
about
spotted
bear
cowardice
in
failing
to
follow
the
into
the
water
and
he
fled
from
the
lodge
and
his
chieftainship
dropped
from
him
as
he
fled
ever
afterward
he
was
no
more
than
a
woman
in
that
great
camp
never
again
was
he
allowed
to
sit
with
the
chiefs
and
warriors
and
when
long
arrow
had
finished
telling
them
all
about
his
wonderful
adventures
the
chief
cried
out
will
move
camp
to
that
lake
of
the
people
they
have
more
we
will
ask
for
them
give
anything
to
obtain
possession
of
such
valuable
animals
they
moved
south
to
the
lake
but
search
as
they
would
could
find
no
nor
did
the
nor
any
of
the
people
appear
although
the
medicine
men
made
sacrifice
to
them
and
prayed
them
to
show
themselves
they
did
discover
however
that
above
this
lake
was
another
and
a
longer
one
hemmed
in
by
still
higher
mountains
and
so
they
named
the
two
the
inside
lakes
and
that
is
the
name
they
bear
to
this
day
last
night
we
all
gathered
in
lodge
and
while
the
pipe
was
filled
and
refilled
and
passed
from
hand
to
hand
on
many
rounds
we
had
more
tales
strange
and
weird
of
the
people
of
the
ancient
days
one
that
our
host
told
especially
interested
me
and
here
it
is
literally
translated
for
your
perusal
it
was
the
story
he
said
of
one
horn
shamer
of
crows
it
was
in
the
long
ago
time
when
all
three
of
our
tribes
the
blackfeet
proper
the
bloods
and
we
the
whom
the
whites
mistakenly
call
blackfeet
were
still
living
in
the
north
country
the
camp
of
the
was
on
big
river
close
up
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
one
of
the
great
chiefs
of
the
tribe
was
one
horn
very
brave
he
was
and
very
rich
for
his
band
of
horses
numbered
more
than
a
hundred
head
he
had
two
wives
sisters
but
no
children
many
orphans
called
him
father
for
he
had
poor
old
couples
care
for
them
and
kept
them
all
well
supplied
with
meat
and
with
skins
for
clothing
he
was
a
peculiar
man
was
one
horn
he
seldom
visited
in
other
lodges
and
was
a
man
of
few
words
it
was
always
difficult
to
get
him
to
tell
of
his
brave
deeds
one
summer
night
one
horn
had
an
uneasy
dream
about
his
horses
and
with
the
first
faint
light
of
coming
day
arose
washed
and
dressed
himself
and
took
up
his
weapons
and
went
out
to
see
if
his
herd
was
anywhere
in
sight
he
climbed
to
a
little
rise
on
the
edge
of
the
plain
saw
them
quietly
feeding
at
a
distance
and
then
saw
something
else
two
men
asleep
in
a
close
under
the
little
rise
they
were
he
thought
young
men
of
the
camp
watchers
of
the
horse
herds
and
he
concluded
to
surprise
them
and
scold
them
for
sleeping
when
they
should
be
watching
the
plains
for
the
approach
of
enemies
more
from
habit
than
anything
else
he
drew
his
bow
fitted
a
war
arrow
to
it
and
then
creeping
close
to
the
sleeping
ones
shouted
you
lazy
ones
awake
to
his
great
surprise
they
were
two
enemies
who
sprang
up
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
he
shot
one
of
them
in
the
breast
and
he
fell
and
as
the
other
turned
and
ran
he
fired
an
arrow
at
him
and
struck
him
in
the
back
but
he
kept
on
running
the
arrow
dangling
and
swaying
from
his
back
and
he
soon
disappeared
in
the
thick
brush
bordering
the
river
one
horn
went
back
to
camp
and
sent
the
warriors
out
to
look
for
the
wounded
man
but
they
never
found
him
although
a
very
brave
warrior
one
horn
voice
was
always
for
peace
he
thought
much
about
the
wars
of
tribe
against
tribe
and
the
great
loss
of
lives
they
caused
and
wished
that
he
could
put
an
end
to
it
all
he
counted
up
the
different
tribes
with
whom
his
people
were
at
war
the
sioux
the
assiniboines
cheyennes
pawnees
snakes
bannocks
pend
flatheads
nez
perc√©s
kootenai
and
crows
and
the
worst
of
them
all
were
the
crows
he
determined
to
go
to
the
crows
and
try
to
make
peace
between
them
and
his
people
another
thought
came
to
him
it
was
best
to
say
nothing
to
his
people
about
his
plan
for
many
would
make
serious
objection
to
it
if
he
succeeded
they
should
know
all
about
it
upon
his
return
if
he
failed
he
would
never
tell
them
where
he
had
been
so
one
evening
he
gave
his
women
orders
what
to
do
and
kept
his
horses
close
in
around
his
lodge
late
that
night
when
all
the
camp
was
asleep
down
came
the
lodge
the
pack
and
travois
horses
were
quietly
loaded
and
he
and
his
women
headed
southward
he
driving
his
big
herd
in
the
lead
the
next
morning
the
people
found
that
they
had
a
mystery
that
they
could
not
solve
one
horn
was
gone
with
all
his
belongings
gone
without
telling
them
one
word
of
his
intentions
why
had
he
left
them
so
secretly
and
whither
had
he
gone
they
never
ceased
talking
about
it
and
wishing
that
he
would
return
they
felt
safe
when
he
was
at
their
backs
traveling
south
day
after
day
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
one
horn
and
his
women
at
last
struck
the
and
following
it
up
came
in
sight
of
the
big
prairies
at
the
foot
of
the
lower
one
of
these
inside
lakes
it
was
then
dusk
but
not
so
dark
but
what
they
could
see
that
there
was
a
big
camp
of
people
at
the
edge
of
the
timber
bordering
the
lake
shore
said
one
horn
must
be
the
ones
i
seek
the
mountain
crows
as
soon
as
they
sleep
we
will
go
on
and
put
up
our
lodge
near
theirs
early
the
next
morning
an
old
man
stepped
out
from
his
lodge
and
saw
a
strange
lodge
standing
by
itself
just
outside
the
circle
of
the
big
camp
he
looked
at
it
a
long
time
and
the
growing
light
at
last
enabled
him
to
see
that
there
were
two
huge
bears
painted
on
its
new
white
leather
skin
he
turned
and
hurried
to
the
lodge
of
the
head
chief
of
the
camp
aroused
him
and
cried
is
a
mystery
something
to
be
looked
into
just
outside
the
circle
of
our
camp
a
strange
lodge
is
standing
it
belongs
not
to
us
mountain
crows
nor
to
our
brothers
the
river
crows
i
know
that
for
it
has
painted
upon
it
two
big
bears
and
neither
of
our
tribes
has
that
medicine
the
chief
hurried
to
get
up
and
dress
and
so
did
others
and
they
soon
left
their
lodges
and
approached
the
strange
lodge
there
was
a
fire
within
it
voices
were
heard
in
conversation
close
around
a
few
horses
were
picketed
and
farther
out
grazed
a
large
band
of
them
mostly
grays
and
blacks
it
was
evident
that
the
owner
of
the
lodge
was
a
chief
a
bear
medicine
man
a
very
rich
man
the
crow
chief
thrust
aside
the
door
curtain
of
the
lodge
and
entered
the
others
following
a
man
at
the
back
of
it
gave
them
the
sign
for
welcome
and
motioned

other
crows
dishes
of
rich
berry

the
best
of
dried
meat
and
back

and
they
ate
with
the
outside
chief
then
they
smoked
again
and
went
home
the
crow
chief
saying
that
he
would
soon
give
a
call
for
a
council
and
would
send
for
the
blackfoot
to
join
in
it
it
was
not
until
near
sunset
however
that
a
youth
came
to
invite
one
horn
to
the
crow
chief
lodge
he
found
assembled
there
all
the
head
men
of
the
tribe
and
the
chief
told
him
that
after
long
talk
they
had
decided
that
they
too
were
tired
of
war
and
would
be
glad
to
make
peace
with
the
blackfeet
be
not
in
a
hurry
to
return
home
the
crow
chief
concluded
us
a
long
visit
and
during
it
we
will
decide
together
where
and
when
our
two
tribes
shall
meet
to
make
this
lasting
peace
treaty
answered
one
horn
shall
be
glad
to
camp
here
with
you
for
the
rest
of
this
moon
and
all
those
present
signed
to
him
remain
here
with
us
for
a
time
one
horn
and
the
crow
chief
became
friends
they
hunted
together
visited
often
in
each
other
lodge
and
together
were
invited
to
other
lodges
to
feast
and
smoke
and
join
in
the
warriors
tales
of
raids
and
battles
and
adventures
along
far
trails
the
river
crows
were
at
this
time
encamped
just
over
the
ridge
from
the
inside
lakes
on
little
river
and
some
of
them
came
frequently
to
visit
their
mountain
brothers
at
the
foot
of
the
lakes
among
others
came
a
man
who
was
always
counting
his
in
a
gathering
of
the
warriors
he
would
wait
until
all
had
told
what
they
had
done
in
war
against
their
enemies
and
then
he
would
count
one
only
one
that
was
far
greater
than
any
of
theirs
on
a
day
when
one
horn
was
visiting
in
the
crow
chief
lodge
this
man
was
one
of
the
guests
the
talk
was
of
war
and
after
many
there
had
told
what
they
had
done
he
said
that
with
a
friend
he
was
approaching
the
blackfeet
camp
and
they
were
discovered
and
surrounded
by
all
the
warriors
of
the
tribe
his
friend
soon
fell
as
full
of
arrows
as
a
porcupine
is
full
of
quills
but
that
he
charging
this
way
that
way
shooting
arrows
fast
and
killing
many
blackfeet
made
them
give
way
before
him
and
he
escaped
from
them
although
wounded
in
the
back
later
on
when
safe
from
pursuit
he
had
drawn
out
the
arrow
and
still
had
it
proof
enough
of
the
truth
of
his
tale
this
man
then
turned
to
one
horn
and
said
by
signs
of
course
have
all
of
us
here
told
about
our
fights
and
now
it
is
your
turn
tell
of
your
brave
deeds
have
nothing
to
say
that
will
interest
you
mine
have
been
just
the
common
experiences
of
those
who
go
on
raids
no
i
have
nothing
to
say
he
answered
you
must
tell
us
one
great
thing
that
you
have
done
the
river
crow
insisted
and
again
one
horn
answered
i
have
done
would
not
interest
you
i
have
nothing
to
say
the
man
then
turned
to
the
mountain
crow
chief
and
said
is
a
poor
kind
of
a
friend
for
you
to
have
he
has
done
nothing
he
is
no
chief
he
is
a
woman
do
not
know
for
sure
but
i
think
that
he
is
a
chief
that
he
has
a
big
war
record
the
host
answered
him
and
then
the
guests
went
their
several
ways
the
river
crow
laughing
shrilly
contemptuously
as
he
left
the
lodge
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
the
river
crow
came
over
again
from
little
river
and
again
was
one
of
a
party
of
guests
in
the
lodge
of
the
chief
of
the
mountain
crows
once
more
the
talk
was
of
war
and
when
it
came
this
man
turn
to
talk
he
drew
an
arrow
from
his
quiver
laid
it
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
and
said
no
one
here
nor
in
the
camp
of
the
mountain
crows
and
the
camp
of
the
river
crows
has
ever
equaled
what
that
stands
for
that
is
the
arrow
that
i
drew
from
my
back
after
my
partner
was
killed
and
i
fought
my
way
through
the
hundreds
of
blackfeet
warriors
killing
many
of
them
and
so
frightening
them
that
they
dared
not
pursue
me
one
horn
leaned
over
looked
at
the
arrow
and
gave
an
exclamation
of
disgust
is
my
arrow
he
signed
know
this
man
now
at
dawn
one
morning
i
discovered
him
and
his
partner
asleep
near
our
camp
i
crept
up
to
them
and
shouted
thinking
that
they
were
our
horseherd
watchers
and
when
they
sprang
up
i
saw
that
they
were
enemies
i
shot
one
of
them
dead
this
man
turned
and
ran
never
even
firing
at
me
and
i
shot
an
arrow
into
his
back
but
he
kept
on
going
and
escaped
from
me
in
the
brush
yes
that
is
the
very
arrow
i
shot
into
him
is
a
lie
a
big
lie
the
river
crow
said
and
signed
for
answer
to
that
one
horn
went
to
the
door
of
the
lodge
and
shouted
to
his
women
to
bring
over
his
quiver
of
arrows
it
was
soon
handed
in
to
him
and
he
said
have
here
two
kinds
of
arrows
hunting
arrows
and
war
arrows
here
are
the
war
arrows
and
he
laid
them
beside
the
arrow
in
front
of
the
boaster
all
there
saw
at
once
that
they
were
exactly
like
it
in
every
way
had
the
same
private
mark
just
back
of
the
point
and
suddenly
with
jeers
and
cries
of
they
took
handfuls
of
ashes
and
earth
from
the
fireplace
and
threw
them
in
the
river
crow
face
and
on
his
head
and
he
ran
for
the
door
and
was
gone
leaving
the
arrow
behind
one
horn
picked
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
quiver
and
said
no
doubt
ends
his
lying
bragging
some
days
after
this
exposure
of
his
lying
the
river
crow
watching
his
chance
entered
the
lodge
of
the
mountain
crow
chief
and
said
to
him
blackfoot
has
shamed
me
i
was
a
chief
but
now
all
people
laugh
at
me
i
want
revenge
let
me
kill
that
friend
of
yours
and
i
will
give
you
three
of
my
best
horses
you
ask
is
impossible
the
chief
replied
is
my
friend
we
have
smoked
together
have
eaten
together
i
can
not
allow
you
to
kill
him
and
for
your
lying
you
deserve
what
you
got
the
river
crow
sneaked
away
but
on
the
next
evening
when
none
but
the
chief
and
his
women
were
at
home
he
came
again
and
this
time
he
said
me
do
what
i
want
to
do
you
know
what
that
is
and
i
will
give
you
five
of
my
best
horses
and
my
beautiful
young
daughter
and
this
time
the
chief
did
not
give
him
a
short
answer
he
thought
over
the
offer
for
a
long
time
he
knew
that
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
to
betray
his
blackfoot
friend
but
the
temptation
was
great
his
women
were
getting
old
he
wanted
that
beautiful
girl
and
at
last
he
gave
way
to
the
temptation
shall
be
as
you
wish
he
told
the
man
is
arranged
for
we
go
with
the
hunters
on
a
big
buffalo
hunt
and
there
will
be
no
chance
for
you
to
do
what
you
want
to
do
come
the
day
after
and
i
will
help
you
if
you
need
my
help
to
kill
the
blackfoot
very
early
the
next
morning
the
hunters
started
out
after
buffalo
one
horn
taking
with
him
one
of
his
women
to
help
in
the
butchering
and
packing
in
of
the
meat
they
were
no
sooner
gone
than
one
of
the
crow
chief
women
hurried
to
one
horn
lodge
and
told
his
other
woman
all
about
the
plan
to
kill
him
she
told
it
because
she
was
jealous
she
did
not
want
her
man
to
take
another
wife
so
it
was
that
when
one
horn
came
home
that
evening
this
wife
ran
to
him
and
embraced
and
kissed
him
as
though
she
would
never
let
him
out
of
her
arms
this
strong
showing
of
love
was
unusual
with
her
and
he
asked
her
the
cause
for
it
you
are
to
die
and
sister
and
i
are
to
become
slaves
see
now
what
you
have
done
by
coming
to
try
to
make
peace
with
these
crows
and
she
told
him
all
about
the
plot
to
end
his
life
but
one
horn
just
laughed
away
your
tears
and
take
courage
he
told
her
crows
will
not
kill
me
a
bear
medicine
man
and
a
chief
they
can
not
kill
me
i
will
show
you
something
that
will
surprise
you
that
night
he
kept
his
favorite
war
horse
picketed
close
to
his
lodge
and
the
next
morning
he
carefully
dressed
himself
in
his
beautiful
war
clothes
painted
himself
and
his
horse
took
his
bow
and
arrows
his
shield
and
spear
and
rode
into
the
center
of
the
big
camp
and
called
upon
the
crow
chief
to
come
out
he
did
come
out
also
dressed
for
battle
and
one
horn
cried
out
to
him
at
the
same
time
making
signs
so
that
he
would
be
sure
to
understand
plot
is
discovered
so

and
that
river
crow
are
going
to
kill
me

i
am
going
to

true
friend
the
chief
of
the
mountain
crows
he
who

and
ate
with
me

who
was
going
to
join
me
in
making
a
lasting
peace
between
our
two
tribes

fight
shall
it
be
on
horseback
or
afoot
i
give
you
the
choice
the
crow
chief
gave
him
no
answer
some
of
the
people
looking
on
were
beginning
to
show
their
anger
and
shame
at
his
betrayal
of
a
friend
he
turned
and
went
back
into
his
lodge
and
would
not
come
out
again
while
this
was
going
on
several
men
had
hurried
to
the
river
crow
man
stopping
in
the
far
end
of
camp
plan
to
kill
the
blackfoot
is
discovered
and
he
is
dressed
and
armed
and
mounted
waiting
to
fight
you
he
is
like
a
raging
grizzly
and
his
you
know
is
the
bear
medicine
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
man
did
not
answer
them
he
mounted
his
horse
and
hidden
from
one
horn
sight
by
the
lodges
struck
out
for
the
river
crow
camp
on
little
river
and
fear
was
with
him
he
often
looked
back
to
see
if
he
were
being
pursued
by
this
dreadful
bear
medicine
man
who
had
once
wounded
him
and
was
now
so
anxious
to
meet
him
face
to
face
one
horn
rode
back
to
his
lodge
down
the
lodge
pack
up
everything
we
will
not
stay
another
day
with
these
treacherous
crows
he
told
them
and
rounded
up
and
caught
what
horses
were
needed
for
packing
and
riding
just
before
they
were
ready
to
leave
the
crow
chief
sent
one
of
his
women
to
say
to
one
horn
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
very
sorry
that
he
had
ever
listened
to
the
river
crow
and
wanted
to
make
reparation
he
wanted
to
give
his
blackfoot
friend
ten
head
of
horses
him
that
i
will
not
accept
anything
from
him
one
horn
answered
the
woman
and
he
and
his
outfit
started
for
the
north
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
of
the
crow
camp
some
days
afterward
they
arrived
at
the
camp
of
their
people
on
the
big
river
of
the
north
and
had
no
sooner
set
up
their
lodge
than
one
horn
called
a
council
of
the
chiefs
and
told
them
where
he
had
been
and
for
what
purpose
i
accomplished
nothing
i
am
glad
i
went
he
told
them
now
know
the
crows
they
are
liars
all
and
not
to
be
trusted
i
advise
that
we
begin
a
steady
war
against
them
the
other
chiefs
agreed
to
that
messengers
were
sent
to
the
brother
tribes
the
bloods
and
the
north
blackfeet
and
to
the
gros
ventres
friends
of
the
blackfeet
and
the
war
was
started
little
by
little
summer
after
summer
they
drove
the
crows
southward
killing
many
of
them
and
were
not
satisfied
until
they
forced
them
to
the
country
south
of
the
elk
river
where
they
have
ever
since
remained
so
because
of
their
treachery
the
crows
lost
a
great
and
rich
country
elk
river
the
yellowstone
river
the
elk
medicine
ceremony
not
in
many
many
years
have
i
been
so
affected
as
i
was
this
morning
for
some
days
i
have
had
a
high
fever
and
have
slept
but
little
at
night
growth
woman
yellow
wolf
wife
had
been
doctoring
me
with
the
good
old
remedy
for
fevers
sweet
sage
tea
but
it
seemed
to
have
no
effect
so
announced
that
he
would
have
his
elk
medicine
ceremony
for
my
benefit
and
that
he
was
sure
that
it
would
cure
me
of
my
illness
we
had
it
this
morning
and
i
have
a
normal
pulse
and
the
fever
has
left
me
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
was
his
prayers
that
cured
me
prayers
far
better
far
more
earnest
than
those
of
any
christian
preacher
i
ever
heard
but
yet
i
am
well
to
me
all
religions
are
nothing
more
than
the
codified
superstitions
of
the
ages
but
of
them
all
christian
and
pagan
i
like
best
the
faith
of
these
my
people
faith
that
the
sun
is
the
conservator
of
all
life
and
the
orderly
ruler
of
this
our
earth
and
what
absolute
faith
they
have
in
their
should
christians
live
as
closely
to
their
beliefs
as
the
blackfeet
do
to
the
laws
of
conduct
given
them
by
their
sun
god
what
a
different
what
a
happy
world
this
would
be
before
i
relate
the
details
of
the
ceremony
i
must
tell
something
of
the
medicine
itself
the
blackfeet
believe
that
when
they
lie
down
and
sleep
their
shadows
or
as
we
say
their
souls
their
spiritualities
leave
the
body
and
go
on
far
adventure
their
name
for
this
is
my
dream
my
vision
and
when
they
awake
they
really
believe
that
they
have
experienced
all
the
incidents
of
their
dream
and
relate
them
as
having
been
of
actual
fact
when
men
and
animals
were
first
created
they
had
a
common
language
and
the
latter
had
the
power
to
change
themselves
at
will
into
the
form
of
man
it
was
in
that
long
ago
time
that
a
man
seeking
knowledge
and
praying
earnestly
for
it
was
in
his
vision
visited
by
an
elk
in
the
form
of
a
man
whose
name
was
chief
i
have
heard
you
praying
asking
for
help
what
is
it
you
want
perhaps
i
can
help
you
the
elk
man
said
the
man
answered
i
seek
some
way
to
relieve
my
people
from
sickness
some
way
to
give
them
long
life
and
happiness
help
me
if
you
can
do
so
the
elk
man
answered
i
can
help
you
i
will
help
you
through
what
was
given
me
in
my
vision
i
am
in
great
favor
with
the
sun
and
all
the
gods
of
the
earth
the
deep
waters
and
the
blue
above
that
medicine
you
shall
have
i
give
it
to
you
now
and
having
said
that
he
gave
the
man
a
painted
lodge
a
medicine
pipestem
beautifully
decorated
with
a
set
of
tail
feathers
of
the
sage
hen
and
wound
with
strips
of
the
fur
of
the
bear
and
various
water
animals
and
with
it
wrapped
in
clean
buckskins
were
the
skins
of
birds
and
animals
all
those
that
live
upon
the
water
and
in
the
water
and
feed
upon
the
life
in
the
water
fish
and
all
the
various
water
insects
and
having
given
the
man
all
this
he
taught
him
how
to
use
it
with
all
the
prayers
and
ceremonies
that
go
with
it
the
man
took
all
this
to
his
home
and
used
it
and
found
that
it
was
great
medicine
and
ever
since
that
time
the
elk
medicine
lodge
and
the
things
that
go
with
it
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
to
this
day
so
now
we
come
to
the
ceremony
that
was
given
for
the
curing
of
my
illness
it
was
my
lucky
day
early
in
the
morning
herford
cowling
chief
photographer
for
the
united
states
reclamation
service
arrived
at
the
great
northern
railway
company
mary
camp
and
i
went
to
him
and
asked
if
he
would
take
moving
pictures
of
the
ceremony
provided
the
indians
were
willing
to
have
him
do
it
he
enthusiastically
replied
that
he
would
be
very
glad
to
take
it
all
in
with
his
so
i
went
to
my
people
to
ask
if
they
would
permit
it
to
be
done
they
objected
saying
that
the
ceremony
was
so
sacred
that
even
the
presence
of
white
people
antagonistic
all
of
them
to
their
religion
would
profane
it
they
did
not
count
me
i
was
one
of
them
said
i
listen
my
relatives
and
brothers
all
we
are
all
soon
to
die
and
as
we
pass
away
the
whole
of
the
old
life
goes
with
us
your
children
taken
away
from
you
by
the
whites
put
in
school
and
taught
the
white
men
religion
and
manner
of
living
will
know
nothing
about
the
way
their
fathers
lived
unless
i
put
it
all
down
in
writing
for
all
time
to
come
that
i
am
doing
and
how
much
more
interesting
it
will
be
if
i
can
have
pictures
to
go
with
it
say
yes
let
us
have
with
this
that
you
are
to
do
the
living
pictures
of
it
all
there
followed
a
long
silence
all
considering
my
request
finally
my
best
of
friends
wiped
tears
from
his
eyes
and
said
brokenly
is
right
the
whites
take
our
children
from
us
and
teach
them
false
beliefs
but
they
teach
them
to
read
and
it
may
be
that
after
we
have
all
gone
on
to
the
sand
hills
they
will
read
our
brother
writings
and
see
us
as
we
were
making
our
prayers
to
the
gods
and
having
read
and
seen
the
pictures
of
it
all
return
to
the
one
true
faith
i
say
let
the
picture
man
come
the
sand
hills
the
drear
abode
of
the
blackfeet
their
shadows
there
had
a
cold
cheerless
imitation
of
life
ai
ai
let
him
come
all
cried
and
i
sent
a
messenger
for
him
during
the
ceremony
he
took
six
hundred
feet
of
it
and
so
for
all
time
to
come
is
preserved
the
interesting
ceremony
of
the
elk
medicine
the
ceremony
is
always
given
in
a
closed
lodge
but
this
time
we
threw
the
front
of
it
wide
open
so
that
the
lens
of
that
machine
could
take
it
all
in
as
i
have
said
is
old
feeble
and
is
himself
unable
to
go
through
parts
of
the
ceremony
so
on
the
evening
before
this
came
off
he
sent
for
chief
crow
and
his
wife
living
near
to
help
him
out
chief
crow
is
also
a
medicine
man
his
wife
of
course
a
medicine
woman
and
he
owns
the
medicine
pipe
four
other
medicine
men
were
there
all
of
them
taking
part
in
the
ceremony
in
each
of
the
three
tribes
of
the
blackfeet
there
is
a
secret
society
of
the
medicine
men
and
the
members
help
one
another
in
their
ceremonies
and
they
and
they
only
can
dance
with
the
sacred
symbols
of
their
rites
when
i
went
into
the
lodge
the
sacred
medicines
were
hanging
directly
over
the
owner
couch
opposite
the
doorway
they
were
the
sacred
pipestem
and
many
skins
of
water
animals
and
birds
enclosed
in
various
wrappings
and
a
buffalo
rawhide
painted
pouch
containing
sacks
of
various
colored
sacred
paints
on
left
sat
his
medicine
wife
i
took
my
seat
close
to
him
on
his
right
back
of
me
and
all
around
the
right
side
of
the
lodge
from
me
were
a
number
of
women
on
the
other
side
opposite
them
were
the
men
and
chief
crow
medicine
wife
the
ceremony
opened
with
a
prayer
by
beseeching
the
gods
to
look
with
favor
upon
what
was
to
be
done
then
his
wife
arose
and
undid
the
fastenings
of
the
medicines
and
slowly
reverently
laid
them
on
the
couch
between
her
and
her
husband
the
opening
song
then
began
the
song
of
chief
oh
how
i
would
like
to
inscribe
that
song
here
alice
fletcher
says
and
i
know
that
she
is
right
that
all
indian
music
is
classical
but
their
tonal
scale
is
far
different
from
ours
we
have
not
one
musical
instrument
that
can
reproduce
it
never
never
lived
a
white
man
who
could
sing
these
blackfeet
songs
as
a
boy
year
after
year
i
tried
to
sing
them
and
always
failed

the

woman
with
a

took
a
coal
from

fire
placed
it
just
in

of

dropped
upon

a

of

it
burned
and
as
the
perfumed
smoke
arose
she
and
her

grasped
handfuls
of
it
and
stroked
their
bodies
thus
purifying
themselves
before
handling
the
medicines
then
all
present
joining
in
they
sang
the
song
of
the
real

the
grizzly
while
the
medicine
woman
unfastened
the
outer
wrapping

was
bound
with

from

they
made

for

upon

began
the
medicine
man
and
the
medicine
woman
clenching
their
hands
and
alternately
putting
one
out
before
the
other
representing
the
deliberate
ponderous
tread
of
the
animals
as
they
traveled
to
and
from
the
water
when
that
song
was
finished
and
it
was
one
to
stir
one
inmost
soul
another
wrapping
bound
with
buffalo
fur
was
undone
and
all
present
besought
the
gods
to
have
pity
upon
them
next
came
the
fourth
and
last
song
the
song
of
the
beaver
chief
of
water
animals
and
while
it
was
being
sung
the
medicine
woman
unrolled
the
fourth
and

and
the
sacred
medicine
pipestem
lay
in
sight
of
us
all
at
that
all
the
women
gave
shrill
cries
of
triumph
of
victory
and
all
the
medicine
men
beginning
a
solemn
chant
to
the
sun
chief
crow
advanced
received
from
the
medicine
wife
of
my
old
friend
the
sacred
stem
and
extending
the
fan
of
feathers
drooping
from
it
held
it
aloft
and
danced
in
time
with
the
song
to
the
doorway
of
the
lodge
and
back
again
and
returned
the
stem
to
my
friend
who
reverently
took
and
embraced
it
and
made
a
short
prayer
to
the
gods
for
the
long
life
good
health
and
happiness
of
us
all
especially
the
little
children
of
the
tribe
next
came
my
part
in
the
ceremony
my
old
relative
and
friend
felt
around
in
his
medicine
pouch
got
out
a
small
sack
of
the
sacred
red
paint
and
painted
my
face
with
it
at
the
same
time
beseeching
the
gods
to
give
me
his
brother
long
life
good
health
and
prosperity
in
all
things
then
having
finished
the
painting
and
the
prayer
he
had
his
wife
hand
chief
crow
his
helper
the
long
wooden
flute
that
goes
with
the
medicine
and
the
latter
holding
it
aloft
danced
with
it
almost
to
the
doorway
of
the
lodge
where
he
blew
several
soft
clear
notes
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
then
returned
the
flute
to
the
woman
this
was
the
elk
medicine
whistle
for
imitating
the
weird
call
of
that
animal
and
was
used
just
now
to
call
him
the
ancient
elk
god
to
give
me
his
favor
his
pity
my
friend
then
facing
me
upon
his
knees
began
the
thunder
song
in
which
all
joined
and
spreading
his
arms
wide
to
represent
the
thunder
bird
wings
hovered
before
me
fanned
me
with
his
wings
the
intent
being
to
waft
to
me
from
him
the
sacred
power
that
over
all
arose
and
passing
in
line
from
the
lodge
chief
crow
leading
danced
through
the
camp
and
back
again
and
the
ceremony
ended
i
can
not
begin
to
express
how
i
felt
all
through
the
ceremony
i
honored
my
people
for
their
sincere
faith
their
reverence
for
their
gods
and
my
thoughts
went
back
to
the
time
when
they
were
the
lords
of
these
plains
and
mountains
and
knew
not
want
and
not
so
very
long
ago
they
were
a
tribe
of
three
thousand
members
and
now
they
number
only
eight
or
nine
hundred
and
those
who
have
gone
have
mostly
gone
from
want
from
their
susceptibility
to
disease
because
of
lack
of
proper
nourishment
do
you
wonder
that
they
feel
bitterly
toward
the
whites
who
have
taken
from
them
everything
that
made
their
life
worth
living

leading
the
column
and
carrying
the
sacred
stem
because
we
were
to
embark
upon
the
deep
dark
waters
of
this
lake
we
yesterday
had
a
little
ceremony
on
the
shore
beseeching
the
dread
people
to
have
pity
upon
us
and
allow
us
to
pass
in
safety
over
their
domain
we
had
a
little
fire
close
to
the
edge
and
having
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
with
a
coal
taken
from
it
with
his
sacred
red
tongs
old
smoked
and
made
his
prayers
at
the
same
time
casting
into
the
water
a
little
sack
of
his
medicines
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
gods
it
was
a
short
ceremony
but
satisfied
even
the
most
timid
of
the
women
that
all
would
be
well
with
them
during
their
voyage
upon
the
lake
and
so
where
we
once
had
rude
rafts
of
logs
lashed
together
with
rawhide
ropes
we
this
morning
embarked
in
good
boats
and
went
all
up
the
beautiful
lake
past
red
eagle
and
little
chief
and
mountains
to
the
head
of
the
lake
and
looking
back
at
the
slope
of
milk
river
ridge
saw
the
enormous
footprints
of
heavy
runner
keeper
of
the
buffalo
away
back
in
ancient
times
after
old
man
had
made
buffalo
and
they
had
increased
and
covered
the
plains
they
had
great
desire
to
wander
westward
and
see
what
might
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
mountains
the
people
the
blackfeet
learning
of
this
were
greatly
distressed
the
far
side
of
the
mountains
away
west
and
still
westward
to
the
shores
of
the
was
the
country
of
their
enemies
many
tribes
of
them
and
should
they
get
possession
of
the
buffalo
herds
they
would
never
let
them
return
what
to
do
about
it
they
had
no
idea
so
they
called
upon
old
man
for
help
illustration
upper
two
medicine
lake
with
pipe
propitiating
the
dreaded
under
water
people
said
he
i
made
the
buffalo
to
be
plains
animals
and
here
upon
these
plains
they
shall
remain
and
tribes
shall
come
to
you
and
ask
permission
to
kill
a
few
of
them
now
and
then
so
do
worry
go
home
now
and
attend
to
your
affairs
all
shall
be
well
with
you
the
people
went
home
they
saw
that
the
buffalo
remained
upon
the
plains
in
apparently
as
great
numbers
as
ever
but
some
of
the
hunters
to
learn
for
sure
if
they
were
all
there
ascended
the
different
passes
of
the
mountains
and
went
down
the
other
side
for
some
distance
there
were
no
buffalo
not
even
a
few
straggling
bulls
on
the
other
side
and
they
wondered
how
old
man
was
keeping
them
back
they
soon
learned
in
a
vision
it
was
revealed
to
an
old
medicine
man
that
a
huge
god
a
man
of
enormous
stature
was
patrolling
the
mountains
from
far
south
to
the
everlasting
snow
of
the
north
and
with
a
club
driving
the
buffalo
back
eastward
as
fast
as
they
came
anywhere
near
the
summit
of
the
range
and
so
it
was
that
the
other
tribes
those
of
the
west
never
got
the
buffalo
on
our
way
down
the
lake
we
passed
the
beautiful
sun
camp
and
the
chalets
of
the
great
northern
perched
upon
the
very
spot
where
and
i
killed
many
a
bighorn
and
goat
in
times
gone
by
it
was
a
favorite
wintering
place
of
the
animals
for
the
winds
kept
the
steep
mountain
slope
practically
bare
from
snow
and
passing
the
mouth
of
the
creek
just
above
the
camp
i
remembered
that
i
had
named
it
after
thomas
and
colonel
robert
and
the
honorable
cecil
baring
of
london
with
whom
i
often
hunted
back
in
the
eighties
in
those
days
there
were
many
bighorn
and
goats
and
not
a
few
grizzlies
back
in
the
basin
at
the
head
of
the
creek
and
what
amusing
and
sometimes
exciting
adventures
we
had
with
them
one
morning
we
espied
a
big
billy
goat
on
a
ledge
and
just
as
we
saw
him
he
moved
to
the
back
side
of
it
and
lay
down
showing
only
an
inch
or
two
of
the
top
of
his
back
who
will
go
up
and
rout
him
out
so
that
i
can
get
a
shot
asked
colonel
baring
and
jack
bean
of
yellowstone
fame
volunteered
it
was
to
be
a
steep
almost
climb
so
jack
laid
down
his
rifle
and
started
without
encumbrance
of
any
kind
at
last
he
reached
the
shelf
and
stood
up
on
it
and
that
billy
came
for
him
head
down
and
jack
never
have
i
seen
a
man
come
down
a
dangerous
cliff
so
fast
as
he
did
and
he
kept
coming
falling
sliding
rolling
and
then
colonel
baring
fired
and
dropped
the
goat
and
man
and
animal
came
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
foot
of
the
place
together
we
had
been
too
much
concerned
for
the
safety
of
our
friend
to
laugh
but
when
he
at
last
stood
up
and
faced
us
bloody
but
not
seriously
hurt
we
roared
but
jack
never
even
smiled
who
would
have
thought
that
a
goat
would
go
for
a
fellow
he
exclaimed
and
he
went
to
the
creek
to
repair
the
damages
to
his
person
on
this
day
halting
here
and
there
along
the
lake
we
took
some
views
of
the
scenery
and
of
our
people
and
at
sunset
were
back
in
our
lodges
for
some
of
us
it
is
a
last
trip
over
the
old
familiar
ground
my
two
old
friends
and
yellow
wolf
must
soon
go
on
to
their
shadow
land
we
were
not
too
tired
for
so
after
the
children
had
been
put
to
bed
and
all
was
quiet
gave
us
the
following
the
story
of
tobacco
which
is
called
in
that
long
ago
time
when
the
earth
was
young
and
people
had
not
long
been
made
a
man
threw
some
weeds
upon
a
fire
and
found
that
the
odor
the
smoke
from
their
burning
was
very
pleasant
that
night
he
had
a
vision
and
learned
that
this
plant
was
strong
medicine
that
when
smoked
in
a
pipe
which
his
vision
explained
to
him
how
to
make
it
would
be
the
right
thing
with
which
to
offer
prayers
to
the
gods
he
also
taught
the
man
the
prayers
and
all
the
ceremony
that
went
with
the
prayers
and
told
him
how
to
plant
the
weeds
from
the
seeds
on
their
tops
so
that
he
could
always
have
plenty
of
it
this
man
was
very
much
pleased
with
what
he
had
learned
he
went
to
his
three
brother
medicine
men
and
told
them
all
about
it
and
the
four
of
them
formed
a
society
of
themselves
and
no
others
for
the
raising
of
the
weed
and
its
proper
uses
but
they
were
very
stingy
with
this
weed
which
they
named
and
would
only
now
and
then
give
the
people
a
leaf
of
it
although
they
raised
large
numbers
of
the
stalks
in
every
summer
time
a
young
man
named
lone
bull
was
very
anxious
to
become
a
member
of
this
medicine
society
but
because
he
had
no
medicines
and
knew
not
the
rites
of
it
he
was
told
that
he
could
not
join
it
at
that
time
the
camp
of
the
people
was
close
under
chief
mountain
he
left
it
with
his
woman
and
his
pack
dogs
and
moved
up
to
the
river
running
out
of
the
inside
lakes
and
there
set
up
his
lodge
said
he
then
to
his
woman
have
come
up
here
to
get
medicines
in
some
way
to
find
things
that
will
enable
me
to
become
a
raiser
of
if
i
can
do
that
i
shall
be
of
great
help
to
the
people
now
then
i
am
going
to
hunt
and
collect
all
the
medicine
skins
i
can
find
and
you
stay
at
home
take
care
of
the
lodge
gather
wood
and
cook
what
meat
we
need
i
shall
bring
in
plenty
of
fat
meat
along
with
the
skins
the
man
went
hunting
every
day
and
the
woman
remained
at
home
one
day
when
the
man
was
gone
she
thought
she
heard
singing
beautiful
singing
but
look
where
she
would
she
could
see
no
singers
she
spoke
to
the
man
about
it
when
he
came
home
that
evening
and
made
him
feel
uneasy
you
hear
it
again
look
about
more
carefully
he
told
her
she
heard
it
the
next
day
and
this
time
located
it
right
under
the
lodge
she
went
out
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
looked
at
the
bank
there
under
the
water
were
beaver
holes
in
it
and
beaver
cuttings
upon
the
sandy
bottom
and
by
that
she
knew
that
the
lodge
had
been
set
up
above
a
bank
beaver
home
and
that
beavers
were
the
singers
she
went
back
to
the
lodge
lay
down
and
put
her
ear
to
the
ground
and
could
then
hear
them
plainly
and
was
pleased
their
singing
was
so
good
that
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
to
stop
listening
to
them
and
begin
cooking
the
evening
meal
when
lone
bull
came
home
that
night
she
told
him
what
she
had
learned
but
he
could
hear
nothing
although
he
put
his
ear
close
to
the
ground
nor
could
he
hear
the
singing
the
next
evening
nor
the
next
although
his
woman
could
hear
it
plainly
so
now
the
woman
got
her
knife
and
cut
a
round
hole
in
the
ground
and
lone
bull
laid
his
head
in
it
and
could
then
hear
the
singing
he
told
her
to
make
the
hole
deeper
larger
she
did
so
and
cut
clear
through
the
ground
and
looking
down
he
could
see
the
beavers
sitting
in
their
home
singing
beautiful
songs
and
dancing
strange
and
beautiful
dances
in
time
to
them
brothers
have
pity
on
me
he
cried
my
young
brothers
teach
me
your
medicine
they
looked
up
and
saw
him
and
one
answered
the
hole
that
you
have
made
because
the
light
disturbs
us
and
we
will
soon
be
with
you
they
soon
came
in
through
the
doorway
four
men
beautifully
dressed
they
had
changed
themselves
from
beavers
to
men
they
took
seats
and
then
one
of
them
said
to
lone
bull
brother
what
is
it
that
you
want
of
us
how
can
we
help
you
lone
bull
told
them
what
it
was
his
great
desire
to
obtain
and
grow
it
for
the
people
have
that
plant
like
us
it
is
from
the
water
a
water
medicine
the
beaver
man
told
him
before
you
can
use
it
you
have
much
to
do
much
to
learn
you
have
to
learn
all
our
songs
and
prayers
and
dances
and
different
ceremonies
and
gather
for
the
ceremonies
a
skin
of
every
animal
and
bird
that
is
of
the
water
one
of
each
except
the
beavers
and
of
them
there
must
be
two
you
know
these
animals
and
birds
otter
mink
muskrat
different
kinds
of
ducks
the
fish
hawk
and
all
the
other
birds
that
get
their
food
from
the
life
of
the
water
why
because
there
are
two
great
of
this
world
the
sun
which
gives
heat
and
water
that
makes
growth
and
in
our
ceremonies
the
skins
of
these
different
animals
are
symbols
of
the
water
shall
collect
them
all
so
teach
me
everything
lone
bull
told
them
and
they
began
that
very
night
day
after
day
lone
bull
hunted
the
animals
and
birds
brought
in
their
skins
for
his
woman
to
cure
and
night
after
night
the
beavers
taught
him
their
medicine
all
the
sacred
prayers
and
dances
and
ceremonies
of
it
and
at
last
he
knew
them
all
thoroughly
then
one
night
the
beaver
chief
handed
him
some
stalks
of
the
top
stems
all
covered
with
little
round
seeds
said
he
the
children
of
the
plants
put
them
into
the
ground
and
they
will
grow
and
make
other
plants
that
bear
children
and
now
i
must
tell
you
just
how
to
plant
gather
a
great
long
wide
pile
of
old
dry
logs
dry
brush
and
weeds
and
set
it
afire
the
heat
from
it
will
burn
the
ground
burn
the
sod
and
make
everything
soft
under
it
then
when
the
place
has
cooled
gather
from
around
badger
holes
squirrel
holes
and
wherever
you
can
find
it
plenty
of
the
brown
earth
they
have
thrown
out
and
mix
it
with
the
burned
black
earth
so
that
it
will
not
pack
hard
around
the
seeds
and
keep
them
from
coming
up
into
the
sunlight
you
have
taken
all
the
seeds
from
the
stems
you
must
put
them
in
a
sack
and
not
touch
them
again
with
your
hands
with
an
antelope
horn
you
will
make
row
after
row
of
little
holes
all
across
the
burned
ground
and
only
a
hand
apart
and
with
a
spoon
drop
a
seed
into
each
hole
when
that
is
done
and
it
will
require
a
long
time
you
and
yours
are
to
dance
along
each
row
of
seed
singing
the
sacred
songs
your
feet
lightly
pressing
down
the
ground
over
the
seed
at
the
end
of
a
row
you
must
step
across
to
the
next
row
and
dance
backward
on
that
one
and
forward
on
the
next
and
so
on
until
the
last
row
has
been
pressed
down
and
all
your
songs
have
been
sung
then
you
can
go
away
from
the
place
for
a
time
return
after
one
moon
has
passed
and
you
will
find
that
the
young
plants
have
grown
above
the
ground
watch
them
that
insects
do
not
destroy
them
give
them
water
if
the
rains
fail
you
they
will
grow
all
summer
and
fade
with
the
ripening
of
the
cut
them
then
care
well
for
them
and
you
and
your
people
will
have
a
plenty
for
your
winter
smokes
and
ceremonies
there
i
have
told
you
all
it
was
then
lone
bull
moved
right
up
to
the
foot
of
the
lower
one
of
the
inside
lakes
and
did
everything
that
he
had
been
told
to
do
his
wife
helping
him
in
every
way
people
hunting
from
down
chief
mountain
way
came
and
saw
his
growing
plants
and
went
home
and
told
about
them
the
four
medicine
men
just
laughed
they
cried
has
no
he
wanted
to
join
us
and
we
would
not
let
him
into
our
society
he
but
plants
some
useless
weed
but
later
on
just
as
their
planting
was
getting
ripe
a
terrible
hailstorm
came
along
and
destroyed
it
all
every
leaf
was
cut
into
fine
pieces
they
cried
from
grief
then
they
said
among
themselves
we
must
have
or
our
medicines
will
be
without
power
it
may
be
that
this
lone
bull
really
has
the
true
plants
let
us
go
up
and
see
them
they
went
all
the
people
with
them
and
saw
that
he
had
the
sacred
plants
the
hailstorm
had
come
nowhere
near
his
place
said
they
to
him
then
have
a
big
planting
and
we
will
help
you
gather
it
and
you
and
we
four
will
use
it
you
shall
join
us
lone
bull
laughed
long
before
he
answered
need
no
help
from
you
you
shall
each
have
a
little
of
my
planting
for
your
own
use
and
you
shall
pay
me
well
for
it
the
rest
excepting
what
i
need
i
shall
give
to
the
people
and
hereafter
they
will
always
have
all
that
they
need
of
the
plants
and
as
he
said
that
he
would
do
so
he
did
and
the
people
gave
him
great
praise
and
honor
for
it
all
and
he
lived
to
great
age
kyi
why
not
he
had
the
beaver
the
water
medicine
it
is
a
powerful
medicine
to
this
day
a
visitor
in
our
camp
this
evening
told
a
tale
that
ill
pleases
us
there
is
a
tourist
camp
away
up
in
pass
one
of
the
most
weirdly
beautiful
places
in
this
whole
country
there
the
other
day
an
employee
was
putting
up
a
table
on
which
were
painted
arrows
pointing
to
the
different
mountains
the
name
of
each
peak
alongside
its
particular
arrow
a
tourist
standing
near
and
watching
the
work
suddenly
exclaimed
why
over
there
is
a
peak
that
has
no
name
can
you
not
name
it
after
me
certainly
i
can
the
employee
answered
and
painted
another
arrow
and
inscribed
beside
it
lehnert
peak
and
over
there
is
a
fine
waterfall
the
tourist
said
will
you
please
name
it
after
my
little
daughter
sure
said
the
man
and
painted
another
arrow
pointing
to
mary
frances
falls
enough
said
v
swift
current
river
we
moved
up
here
the
other
day
and
made
camp
beside
one
of
the
most
lovely
lakes
in
all
this
rocky
mountain
country
in
my
time
we
called
it
beaver
woman
lake
it
is
now
mcdermott
lake
and
what
a
name
that
is
for
one
of
nature
gems
there
are
names
for
other
lakes
and
peaks
here
just
as
bad
as
that
but
we
shall
have
nothing
to
say
about
them
here
only
by
an
act
of
congress
can
we
get
what
we
want
done
and
we
have
faith
that
within
a
reasonable
time
all
these
mountains
and
lakes
and
streams
will
bear
the
names
of
the
great
chiefs
medicine
men
and
warriors
who
traversed
them
before
the
white
men
came
illustration
iceberg
lake
immense
bergs
are
continually
dropping
into
it
from
the
live
glacier
in
background
some
of
us
all
excepting
our
two
old
men
and
the
women
have
been
riding
over
the
different
trails
here
viewing
the
glaciers
and
other
places
of
interest
especially
iceberg
lake
where
we
saw
a
mass
of
ice
as
large
as
a
house
part
from
the
glacier
splash
down
into
the
deep
lake
and
disappear
and
after
a
time
come
up
from
the
depths
to
the
surface
and
create
another
commotion
of
the
waters
it
was
a
grand
sight
says
that
the
lake
with
the
unpronounceable
white
man
name
mcdermott
should
be
called
jealous
women
lake
that
away
back
in
the
days
of
his
youth
when
the
kootenai
indians
occasionally
came
to
camp
and
hunt
with
the
blackfeet
he
had
a
youthful
friend
of
the
mountain
tribe
who
told
him
the
following
story
the
jealous
women
in
those
days
a
young
kootenai
good
of
heart
a
great
hunter
and
very
brave
married
twin
sisters
so
alike
that
except
for
one
thing
they
could
not
be
told
apart
one
was
a
slow
the
other
a
very
fast
talker
in
time
the
fast
talker
named
marmot
became
jealous
of
her
sister
camas
complaining
all
the
time
that
she
had
to
do
the
most
of
the
lodge
work
and
that
she
was
sure
camas
said
bad
things
about
her
to
their
man
camas
denied
all
this
have
never
tried
to
place
myself
first
with
our
man
she
said
are
twins
i
love
you
dearly
our
man
heart
is
so
big
that
it
holds
us
both
in
equal
love
now
be
sensible
cast
out
your
bad
thoughts
for
they
are
all
wrong
but
marmot
persisted
in
believing
that
she
was
neglected
that
her
sister
had
all
their
man
affection
and
she
finally
went
to
him
with
her
complaint
he
laughed
love
you
just
as
much
as
i
do
your
sister
he
said
just
think
back
and
show
me
when
and
in
what
way
i
have
shown
that
she
is
first
with
me
marmot
sat
down
and
thought
she
thought
a
long
time
remained
silent
the
man
was
very
patient
with
her
he
waited
for
her
answer
but
it
did
not
come
at
last
he
said
you
have
thought
a
long
time
have
you
found
one
thing
in
which
i
gave
her
preference
i
have
but
all
the
same
i
believe
that
you
love
her
best
marmot
answered
and
got
up
and
went
about
her
work
the
man
shook
his
head
made
no
answer
to
that
and
took
up
his
weapons
and
went
hunting
down
the
river
at
the
time
he
was
camped
right
here
at
this
lake
the
man
had
not
gone
far
moving
slowly
carefully
through
the
timber
and
brush
along
the
river
when
he
heard
ahead
a
great
splashing
in
the
water
and
going
closer
found
that
it
was
caused
by
two
otters
playing
they
would
chase
each
other
in
the
water
then
climb
the
bank
and
go
as
swift
as
arrows
from
a
bow
down
a
slide
that
they
had
made
and
again
chase
and
tumble
each
other
over
in
the
water
the
man
crept
closer
to
the
slide
an
arrow
in
his
bow
another
in
his
hand
and
watching
his
chance
shot
one
of
the
players
he
tried
to
get
the
other
but
it
dived
and
was
gone
before
he
could
fit
the
other
arrow
to
his
bow
is
too
bad
that
i
did
get
the
other
i
would
have
liked
a
skin
of
these
medicine
skins
for
each
of
my
women
he
said
to
himself
he
took
the
otter
home
and
handed
it
to
camas
is
yours
he
said
were
two
of
them
marmot
i
will
get
the
other
for
you
and
then
you
will
each
have
a
strong
medicine
skin
marmot
said
nothing
but
looked
cross
the
man
went
hunting
the
next
day
but
he
could
not
find
the
other
otter
he
searched
the
river
for
many
days
and
could
not
find
one
and
as
the
days
passed
marmot
became
more
and
more
angry
and
finally
said
to
her
sister
have
proof
now
that
our
man
loves
you
best
he
gave
you
the
otter
he
does
not
even
try
to
get
one
for
me
he
hunts
other
animals
every
day
bighorn
goats
animals
that
live
nowhere
near
the
haunts
of
the
otter
do
be
foolish
camas
answered
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
has
tried
and
tried
to
get
the
other
otter
for
you
but
at
the
same
time
he
has
to
get
meat
for
us
that
is
why
he
hunts
the
mountain
animals
the
two
of
us
can
no
longer
live
in
this
lodge
cried
marmot
are
a
bad
woman
i
hate
you
i
will
fight
you
any
way
you
say
to
see
which
of
us
shall
be
our
man
one
wife
then
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
camas
became
angry
have
no
weapons
to
fight
with
she

i
propose
this
we
will
swim
this
lake
across
and
back
and
across
and
back
until
one
of
us
becomes
tired
and
drowns
now
crazy
woman
what
do
you
say
to
that
on
come
on
marmot
cried
and
ran
to
the
shore
and
tore
off
her
clothes
so
did
camas
and
the
two
rushed
into
the
water
and
began
their
swim
of
hate
they
crossed
the
lake
turned
and
came
back
crossed
again
and
started
back
camas
well
in
the
lead
she
reached
the
shore
in
front
of
the
lodge
dragged
herself
out
on
the
shore
and
turned
her
sister
had
gone
down
there
was
not
even
a
ripple
on
the
still
water
marmot
was
drowned
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
she
put
on
her
clothes
and
went
into
the
lodge
and
cried
and
cried
the
man
came
home
she
was
still
crying
he
asked
her
where
marmot
was
and
she
cried
all
the
harder
but
at
last
told
him
all
then
the
man
cried
together
the
two
mourned
for
a
long
time
and
searched
the
lake
for
the
body
of
the
lost
one
and
could
not
find
it
so
they
moved
away
from
the
unhappy
place
and
returned
to
the
camp
of
their
people
but
it
was
a
long
time
a
very
long
time
before
they
ceased
mourning
and
never
again
would
they
go
anywhere
near
the
lake
yes
this
is
the
lake
of
the
jealous
women
vi
chief
mountain
we
came
up
here
the
other
day
to
the
foot
of
this
great
landmark
of
the
country
and
made
camp
beside
a
running
spring
in
the
edge
of
the
timber
the
mountain
is
most
appropriately
named
it
is
the
outer
one
of
an
eastward
projecting
spur
of
the
range
and
is
higher
than
any
of
the
peaks
behind
it
a
chief
a
leader
should
always
be
taller
more
conspicuous
in
every
way
than
his
followers
this
mountain
gradually
slopes
up
eastward
from
the
one
behind
it
to
an
altitude
of
feet
then
drops
in
a
sheer
cliff
several
thousand
feet
to
its
steep
slope
running
down
to
the
plain
from
several
hundred
miles
to
the
north
and
an
equal
distance
to
the
south
and
from
the
bear
paw
mountains
to
the
east
it
can
be
plainly
seen
grim
majestic
a
veritable
chief
of
mountains
and
for
that
reason
the
blackfeet
so
named
it
in
the
long
ago
the
way
to
climb
the
mountain
is
by
the
long
narrow
and
in
places
ridge
running
up
toward
its
summit
from
the
west
and
then
one
has
but
one
cliff
to
surmount
the
one
almost
at
its
crest
only
men
and
goats
and
bighorn
can
scale
that
cliff
but
on
the
extreme
summit
lies
an
old
buffalo
skull
taken
there
by
a
blackfoot
in
the
long
ago
for
a
pillow
rest
while
getting
his
medicine
dream
there
he
fasted
for
days
and
at
last
in
his
weakened
condition
resulting
from
want
of
food
and
water
got
his
vision
his
medicine
which
was
to
be
his
guardian
through
life
who
was
it
that
came
to
him
in
his
fasting
dreams
ancient
buffalo
perhaps
or
maybe
morning
star
whoever
it
was
he
went
staggering
down
the
mountain
and
to
camp
absolutely
certain
that
he
had
found
his
guardian
spirit
his
medium
for
favor
with
the
greatest
god
of
all
the
sun
supreme
ruler
of
this
earth
illustration
en
route
to
iceberg
lake
we
are
here
again
upon
our
own
ground
the
blackfeet
reservation
and
so
once
more
have
meat
in
camp
fat
bighorn
and
fat
mule
deer
killed
by
our
hunters
this
was
once
a
great
wintering
place
for
deer
and
elk
and
higher
up
for
bighorn
some
years
ago
a
hunter
by
name
trailed
a
band
of
elk
around
to
the
ridge
behind
the
mountain
and
up
its
narrow
way
until
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
near
the
summit
and
could
go
no
farther
there
they
turned
back
toward
him
and
he
fired
one
shot
and
dropped
the
leader
the
others
afraid
to
try
to
dash
past
him
chose
the
one
alternative
they
rushed
to
the
high
cliff
there
on
the
north
side
of
the
ridge
and
sprang
from
it
and
were
all
killed
by
the
fall
eighty
head
of
them
last
night
after
our
feast
of
real
meat
we
gathered
in
yellow
wolf
lodge
for
a
smoke
and
a
talk
and
our
host
gave
us
a
little
story
that
i
must
here
set
down
the
story
of
the
wise
man
here
under
this
mountain
the
people
were
encamped
and
two
of
them
were
wise
man
and
his
woman
he
was
so
named
because
he
was
always
finding
out
how
to
do
useful
things
up
to
the
time
of
this
encampment
the
people
had
had
nothing
to
wear
but
the
plainest
kind
of
garments
shirts
leggins
gowns
moccasins
all
made
of
plain
tanned
leather
of
different
kinds
wise
man
thought
long
about
this
and
finally
said
to
his
wife
us
move
away
from
camp
for
a
time
and
go
farther
into
the
mountains
i
have
a
plan
that
i
want
to
try
by
myself
the
next
morning
they
packed
their
dogs
and
moved
up
to
the
foot
of
the
inside
lakes
crossed
the
outlet
and
made
camp
wise
man
then
did
some
hunting
killed
plenty
of
meat
for
his
wife
and
the
dogs
and
began
on
his
plan
for
making
clothing
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
he
went
up
on
the
high
ridge
between
the
lakes
and
little
river
and
dug
an
eagle
trap
that
is
he
dug
a
pit
somewhat
longer
and
wider
than
his
body
and
quite
deep
and
killed
a
deer
and
laid
it
beside
the
pit
and
slashed
its
body
so
that
the
liver
protruded
he
then
got
into
the
pit
covered
the
top
of
it
with
willow
sticks
and
grass
and
waited
hoping
that
eagles
would
see
the
deer
and
come
to
eat
it
they
did
come
he
could
hear
the
heavy
swish
of
their
wings
as
they
sailed
down
upon
it
and
as
they
were
eating
the
liver
he
would
cautiously
reach
up
grasp
them
by
the
legs
pull
them
down
into
the
pit
and
kneeling
upon
them
crush
out
their
life
in
this
way
one
at
a
time
he
caught
many
eagles
and
took
them
home
as
he
caught
them
and
took
from
their
bodies
the
tail
feathers
the
fluffy
plume
feathers
and
others
that
he
thought
would
answer
his
purpose
they
had
a
very
rank
unpleasant
odor
these
feathers
so
when
he
thought
that
he
had
enough
of
them
he
had
his
woman
cover
the
floor
of
the
lodge
with
a
thick
layer
of
sweet
sage
upon
which
he
carefully
spread
them
he
then
threw
a
quantity
of
sweetgrass
upon
the
fire
and
running
from
the
lodge
the
two
tightly
closed
it
and
kept
the
smoke
inside
this
last
they
did
three
or
four
times
until
the
feathers
lost
their
bad
odor
and
were
perfumed
with
the
pleasant
odor
of
sweetgrass
and
sweet
sage
both
perfumes
sacred
to
the
gods
as
they
afterward
learned
winter
was
now
come
and
wise
man
began
to
hunt
weasels
brown
and
common
of
appearance
in
summer
but
white
and
beautiful
in
winter
this
was
more
difficult
work
than
trapping
eagles
but
by
setting
many
snares
he
caught
during
the
winter
more
than
a
hundred
of
them
he
then
made
a
headdress
of
some
of
the
eagle
tail
feathers
and
suspended
from
it
a
number
of
weasel
skins
and
along
the
seams
of
his
shirt
and
leggins
tied
a
number
of
the
weasel
skins
he
then
put
on
the
headdress
and
his
ornamental
clothes
and
stood
up
and
asked
his
woman
how
he
appeared
in
them
seem
to
have
become
a
different
man
she
answered
look
very
brave
very
handsome
the
clothes
are
beautiful
are
of
better
appearance
than
they
were
he
said
i
am
not
yet
satisfied
perhaps
i
can
improve
them
but
first
i
have
to
do
something
for
you
wise
man
put
away
his
new
clothes
and
in
old
ones
hunted
elk
taking
from
them
their
two
tushes
and
in
the
evening
boring
holes
in
the
soft
part
having
collected
two
hundred
he
sewed
them
in
rows
on
the
breast
and
the
back
of
his
woman
new
gown
and
both
saw
that
it
was
then
a
handsome
gown
said
the
woman
we
are
now
complete
we
have
fine
appearance
let
us
go
home
and
show
the
people
what
we
have
done
wise
man
answered
is
lacking
something
that
will
make
our
clothes
really
beautiful
i
have
done
all
that
i
can
without
help
and
now
i
shall
ask
the
gods
to
show
me
what
more
to
do
perhaps
it
was
the
gods
that
directed
his
footsteps
the
next
day
as
he
was
going
through
the
timber
he
came
upon
the
remains
of
a
porcupine
its
quills
scattered
all
around
upon
the
ground
he
sat
down
took
up
some
and
examined
them
and
the
thought
came
to
him
that
they
could
be
dyed
different
colors
and
in
some
way
sewed
upon
garments
and
make
them
of
brighter
hue
he
took
all
that
he
could
find
and
killed
several
more
porcupines
and
carried
home
all
the
long
quills
to
his
woman
and
told
her
his
plan
said
she
know
that
the
yellow
moss
that
grows
on
pine
trees
will
stain
anything
a
yellow
that
will
not
fade
that
can
not
be
washed
off
let
us
seek
for
other
colors
they
sought
a
long
time
finding
a
green
color
in
a
certain
wood
a
red
in
the
juice
of
a
plant
and
then
they
dyed
the
quills
the
three
colors
meantime
the
woman
had
been
trying
different
ways
to
fasten
the
quills
to
leather
and
now
by
flattening
them
turning
in
the
ends
and
sewing
them
side
by
side
with
very
fine
sinew
and
with
the
finest
of
bone
needles
she
succeeded
in
making
long
bands
of
them
of
different
designs
in
the
various
colors
she
was
a
long
long
time
making
them
but
at
last
she
made
enough
of
the
bands
to
sew
onto
the
arms
of
wise
man
shirt
and
down
his
leggins
and
upon
the
neck
of
her
gown
each
was
so
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
the
other
then
that
they
kissed
and
almost
cried
with
joy
early
the
following
morning
they
packed
up
crossed
the
river
and
started
for
the
camp
still
here
at
chief
mountain
as
soon
as
they
came
in
sight
of
it
they
stopped
put
on
their
fine
clothes
and
then
went
on
the
people
saw
them
approaching
but
not
until
they
were
right
close
to
the
camp
were
they
recognized
then
what
a
crowd
surrounded
them
staring
at
their
beautiful
garments
asking
questions
without
end
and
as
soon
as
they
learned
how
this
had
all
been
done
they
began
at
once
to
gather
material
for
similar
clothing
and
wise
man
of
course
became
a
great
man
in
the
tribe
for
to
him
was
due
the
discovery
of
the
way
to
make
beautiful
things

although
nothing
has
been

we
have
not

so
cheerful
as
usual
for
the
past
few
days
for
all
have
known
that
we
must
soon
part

go

have
not
been

unalloyed
joy
all
have
been
tinged
with

regret

when
we

so
after

together
we
had
no
no

had
the
heart
for
it
