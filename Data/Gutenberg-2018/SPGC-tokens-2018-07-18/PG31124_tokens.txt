it

among

that
owe
their

to

the

might
be

as
a

the

i
outside

i
like
discipline
i
like
to
be
part
of
an
institution
it
gives
one
more
liberty
than
is
possible
among
three
or
four
observant
friends
it
is
always
cool
and
wonderful
after
the
monotone
of
the
dim
hospital
its
corridors
stretching
as
far
as
one
can
see
to
come
out
into
the
dazzling
starlight
and
climb
the
hill
up
into
the
trees
and
shrubberies
here
the
wind
was
terrible
i
had
to
battle
up
and
the
leaves
were
driven
down
the
hill
so
fast
that
once
i
thought
it
was
a
madeleine
garden
next
door
is
all
deserted
now
they
have
gone
up
to
london
the
green
asphalt
is
shining
with
rain
the
blue
pond
brown
with
slime
the
little
statues
and
bowls
are
lying
on
their
sides
to
keep
the
wind
from
putting
them
forcibly
there
and
all
over
the
house
are
white
draperies
and
ghost
chairs
when
i
walk
in
the
garden
i
feel
like
a
ghost
left
over
from
the
summer
too
i
became
aware
of
one
face
detaching
itself
from
the
rest
it
is
not
a
more
pleasing
face
than
the
others
but
it
is
becoming
conspicuous
to
me
twice
a
week
when
there
is
a
concert
in
the
big
hall
the
officers
and
the
are
divided
by
some
unspoken
rule
the
officers
sitting
at
one
side
of
the
room
the
in
a
white
row
on
the
other
when
my
eyes
rest
for
a
moment
on
the
motley
of
mackintoshes
uniforms
i
inevitably
see
in
the
line
one
face
set
on
a
slant
one
pair
of
eyes
forsaking
the
stage
and
fixed
on
me
in
a
steady
inoffensive
beam
this
irritates
me
the
very
lack
of
offence
irritates
me
but
one
grows
to
look
for
everything
afterwards
in
the
during
mess
he
will
ask
politely
what
did
you
think
of
the
concert
sister
good
show
how
wonderful
to
be
called
sister
every
time
the
uncommon
name
is
used
towards
me
i
feel
the
glow
of
an
implied
relationship
something
which
links
me
to
the
speaker
my
sister
remarked
if
it
only
a
matter
of
that
we
can
provide
thrills
for
you
here
very
easily
the
name
of
my
admirer
is
after
all
pettitt
the
other
nurse
in
the
mess
who
is
very
grand
and
insists
on
pronouncing
his
name
in
the
french
way
says
he
is
of
humble
origin
he
seems
to
have
no
relations
and
no
visitors
out
in
the
corridor
i
meditate
on
love
laying
trays
soothes
the
activity
of
the
body
and
the
mind
works
softly
i
meditate
on
love
i
say
to
myself
that
pettitt
is
to
be
envied
i
am
still
the
wonder
of
the
unknown
to
him
i
exist
walk
talk
every
day
beneath
the
beam
of
his
eye
impenetrable
he
fell
down
again
yesterday
and
his
foot
wo
heal
he
has
time
before
him
but
in
a
hospital
one
has
never
time
one
is
never
sure
he
has
perhaps
been
here
long
enough
to
learn
that
to
feel
the
insecurity
the
impermanency
at
any
moment
he
may
be
forced
to
disappear
into
the
secondary
stage
of
convalescent
homes
yes
the
impermanency
of
life
in
a
hospital
an
everlasting
dislocation
of
combinations
like
nuns
one
must
learn
to
do
with
no
nearer
friend
than
god
bolts
in
the
shape
of
sudden
whimsical
orders
are
flung
by
an
almighty
whom
one
does
not
see
the
sister
who
is
over
me
the
only
sister
who
can
laugh
at
things
other
than
jokes
is
going
in
the
first
week
of
next
month
why
where
she
does
know
but
only
smiles
at
my
impatience
she
knows
life
hospital
life
it
unsettles
me
as
i
lay
my
spoons
and
forks
trays
it
takes
an
hour
to
do
thirteen
pieces
on
each
tray
thirteen
times
eight
hundred
and
things
to
collect
lay
square
up
symmetrically
i
make
little
absurd
reflections
and
arrangements
taking
a
dislike
to
the
knives
because
they
will
not
lie
still
on
the
polished
metal
of
the
tray
but
pivot
on
their
shafts
and
swing
out
at
angles
after
my
fingers
have
left
them
i
love
the
long
the
dim
and
lonely
corridor
the
light
centred
in
the
gleam
of
the
trays
yellow
butters
cylinders
of
glass
impermanency
i
do
wonder
the
sisters
grow
so
secret
so
uneager
how
often
stifled
how
often
torn
apart
it
heaven
to
me
to
be
one
of
such
a
number
of
faces
to
see
them
pass
into
mess
like
ghosts
gentleman
tinker
and
tailor
each
having
shuffled
home
from
death
each
having
known
his
life
rock
on
its
base
not
talking
much
for
what
is
there
to
say
not
laughing
much
for
they
have
been
here
too
long
is
a
nightly
pleasure
to
me
creatures
of
habit
all
the
coloured
range
themselves
round
the
two
long
tables
this
man
in
this
seat
that
man
by
the
this
man
with
his
drawn
up
at
the
end
that
man
at
the
corner
where
no
one
will
jostle
his
arm
curious
how
these
officers
leave
the
hospital
so
silently
disappearances
one
face
after
another
slips
out
of
the
picture
the
unknown
heart
behind
the
face
fixed
intently
on
some
other
centre
of
life
i
went
into
a
soldiers
ward
to
inquire
about
a
man
who
has
pneumonia
round
his
bed
there
stood
three
red
screens
and
the
busy
heads
of
two
sisters
bobbed
above
the
rampart
it
suddenly
shocked
me
what
were
they
doing
there
why
the
screens
why
the
look
of
strain
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
in
the
next
bed
who
could
see
behind
the
screens
i
went
cold
and
stood
rooted
waiting
till
one
of
them
could
come
out
and
speak
to
me
soon
they
took
away
the
screen
nearest
to
me
they
had
done
with
it
the
man
i
was
to
inquire
for
has
no
nostrils
they
were
blown
away
and
he
breathes
through
two
pieces
of
red
rubber
tubing
it
gave
a
more
horrible
look
to
his
face
than
i
have
ever
seen
the
sister
came
out
and
told
me
she
thought
he
was
not
up
to
much
i
think
she
means
he
is
dying
i
wonder
if
he
thinks
it
better
to
die
but
he
was
nearly
well
before
he
got
pneumonia
had
begun
to
take
up
the
little
habits
of
living
he
had
been
out
to
tea
inexplicable
what
he
thinks
of
lying
behind
the
screen
i
was
laying
my
trays
in
the
corridor
the
dim
corridor
that
i
am
likely
often
to
mention
the
occasional
blue
hanging
at
intervals
down
the
roof
in
a
dwindling
perspective
the
only
unshaded
light
in
the
corridor
hangs
above
my
head
making
the
cutlery
gleam
in
my
hands
the
of
a
lame
foot
approached
down
the
stone
tiling
with
the
tapping
soft
and
dull
of
a
he
paused
by
the
pillar
as
i
knew
he
would
and
i
busied
myself
with
an
added
rush
and
hurry
an
added
irritating
noise
of
spoons
flung
down
he
waited
patiently
shyly
i
did
look
up
but
i
knew
his
face
was
half
smiling
and
suppliant
we
shall
miss
you
he
said
but
i
shall
be
back
in
a
week
we
shall
miss
you
laying
the
trays
out
here
everything
passes
i
said
gaily
he
whistled
a
little
and
balanced
himself
against
his
stick
you
are
like
me
sister
he
said
earnestly
and
i
saw
that
he
took
me
for
a
philosopher
he
shuffled
on
almost
beyond
the
circle
of
light
paused
while
my
lips
moved
in
a
vague
smile
of
response
then
moved
on
into
the
shadow
the
low
deep
quiet
of
the
corridor
resumed
its
hold
on
me
the
patter
of
reflection
in
my
brain
proceeded
undisturbed
you
are
like
me
the
deepest
flattery
one
creature
pays
its
fellow
the
cry
which
is
uttered
when
another
enters
our
country
far
down
the
corridor
a
slim
figure
in
white
approaches
dwarfed
by
the
smoky
distance
her
cap
floating
her
scarlet
cape
the
cape
of
pride
slipped
round
her
narrow
shoulders
how
intent
and
silent
they
are
i
watched
this
one
pass
with
a
look
one
should
never
aspire
to
know
a
sister
intimately
they
are
disappointing
people
without
candour
without
imagination
yet
what
a
look
of
personality
hangs
about
them
pettitt
sister
yes
mr
pettitt
do
you
ever
go
to
theatres
do
you
like
them
at
the
risk
of
appearing
unnatural
i
said
not
much
oh
i
thought
h
that
a
pity
do
you
like
revues
oh
yes
i
thought
you
take
me
to
a
one
afternoon
oh
charming
i
ca
get
leave
in
the
afternoons
though
you
often
have
a
day
off
yes
but
it
too
soon
to
ask
for
another
well
how
about
wednesday
then
too
soon
think
of
the
new
sister
and
her
opinion
of
me
that
has
yet
to
be
won
well
let
me
know
anyway
staved
off
the
new
sister
is
coming
quite
soon
she
has
a
medal
now
that
i
know
sister
must
go
i
do
talk
to
her
much
i
almost
avoid
her
that
true
hospital
philosophy
i
must
put
down
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
the
woman
laugh
in
the
shadowy
hedge
i
walked
up
from
the
hospital
late
eight
and
hungry
in
the
cold
brilliant
moonlight
a
fine
moon
very
low
throwing
long
pointed
shadows
across
the
road
from
the
trees
and
hedges
as
one
climbs
up
there
is
a
wood
on
the
right
the
remains
of
the
old
wooded
hill
sparse
trees
very
tall
and
a
star
between
every
branch
and
a
fierce
moon
beating
down
on
the
mud
and
grass
i
had
on
my
white
cap
and
long
blue
coat
very
visible
the
moon
swept
the
road
from
side
to
side
lovers
acting
as
though
it
were
night
were
lit
as
though
it
was
day
i
turned
into
the
wood
to
take
a
message
to
a
house
set
back
from
the
road
and
the
moonlight
and
the
night
vapour
rising
from
the
marshy
ground
were
all
tangled
together
so
that
i
could
hardly
see
hedge
from
field
or
path
i
saw
a
lit
and
a
woman
laugh
came
across
the
field
as
naturally
as
if
a
sheep
had
bleated
in
the
swampy
grass
it
struck
me
that
the
dark
countryside
was
built
to
surround
and
hide
a
laugh
like
hers
the
laugh
of
a
lover
animal
and
protesting
i
saw
the
glowing
end
of
the
cigarette
dance
in
a
curve
and
fall
to
the
ground
and
she
laughed
again
more
faintly
walking
on
in
the
middle
of
the
moonlight
i
reached
the
gate
i
was
looking
for
ran
up
the
pebbly
drive
to
the
window
gave
my
message
and
returned
i
slipped
my
cap
off
my
hair
and
pushed
it
into
my
pocket
keeping
under
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
into
the
quiet
field
they
were
whispering
do
you
i
do
are
you
i
am
crushed
into
the
set
branches
of
the
hedge
the
mess
went
vilely
sister
adds
up
on
her
fingers
and
fatal
so
all
the
numbers
were
out
and
the
sent
in
meats
instead
of
i
blushed
with
horror
and
responsibility
standing
there
watching
six
hungry
men
pretending
to
be
philosophers
the
sergeant
wolfed
the
cheese
too
he
got
it
out
from
under
my
very
eyes
while
i
was
clearing
the
tables
and
ate
it
standing
up
to
it
in
the
pantry
with
his
back
to
me
when
i
went
in
to
fetch
a
tray
whenever
i
see
that
broad
khaki
back
the
knickered
legs
astride
the
flexed
i
know
that
his
digestion
is
laying
up
more
trouble
for
him
benks
the
mess
orderly
overeats
himself
too
he
comes
to
the
bunk
and
thrusts
his
little
smile
round
the
door
sister
i
got
another
of
them
sick
very
cheerfully
as
though
he
had
got
something
worth
having
she
actually
retorted
benks
you
eat
too
much
one
day
but
he
only
swung
on
one
leg
and
smiled
more
cheerfully
than
ever
the
new
sister
has
come
that
should
mean
a
lot
what
about
habits
of
life
the
new
sister
has
come
and
at
present
she
is
absolutely
without
personality
beyond
her
medal
she
appears
to
be
deaf
i
went
along
to
see
and
ask
after
the
man
who
has
his
nose
blown
off
after
the
long
walk
down
the
corridor
in
almost
total
darkness
the
vapour
of
the
rain
floating
through
every
open
door
and
window
the
sudden
brilliancy
of
the
ward
was
like
a
haven
the
man
lay
on
my
right
on
entering
the
screen
removed
from
him
far
up
the
ward
the
sister
was
working
by
a
bed
ryan
the
man
with
his
nose
gone
was
lying
high
on
five
or
six
pillows
slung
in
his
position
by
tapes
and
webbing
passed
under
his
arms
and
attached
to
the
bedposts
he
lay
with
his
profile
to
me
only
he
has
no
profile
as
we
know
a
man
like
an
ape
he
has
only
his
bumpy
forehead
and
his
protruding
lips
the
nose
the
left
eye
gone
he
was
breathing
heavily
they
do
know
yet
whether
he
will
live
when
a
man
dies
they
fetch
him
with
a
stretcher
just
as
he
came
in
only
he
enters
with
a
blanket
over
him
and
a
flag
covers
him
as
he
goes
out
when
he
came
in
he
was
one
of
a
convoy
but
every
man
who
can
stand
rises
to
his
feet
as
he
goes
out
then
they
play
him
to
his
funeral
to
a
grass
mound
at
the
back
of
the
hospital
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
hospital
for
instance
the
visitors
there
is
the
lady
who
comes
in
to
tea
and
wants
to
be
introduced
to
every
one
as
though
it
was
a
she
jokes
about
the
cake
its
scarcity
or
its
quantity
and
makes
a
lot
of
fun
about
two
lumps
of
sugar
when
she
is
at
her
best
the
table
assumes
a
perfect
and
listening
silence
not
the
silence
of
the
critic
but
the
silence
of
the
absorbed
child
treasuring
every
item
of
talk
for
future
use
after
she
goes
the
joy
of
her
will
last
them
all
the
evening
there
is
the
lady
who
comes
in
to
tea
and
sitting
down
at
the
only
unlaid
table
cries
nurse
i
have
no
knife
or
plate
or
cup
and
i
prefer
a
glass
of
boiling
water
to
tea
and
would
you
mind
sewing
this
button
on
my
glove
there
is
the
lady
who
comes
in
and
asks
the
table
at
large
i
wonder
if
any
one
knows
general
biggens
i
once
met
him
or
you
been
in
gallipoli
did
you
run
across
my
young
cousin
a
lieutenant
in
the
well
he
was
only
there
two
days
or
so
i
suppose
exactly
as
though
she
was
talking
about
cairo
in
the
season
there
was
the
limit
she
sat
two
paces
away
from
where
i
sit
to
pour
out
tea
her
face
was
kind
but
inquisitive
with
that
brown
round
the
eyes
and
a
large
rakish
hat
she
comes
often
having
heard
of
him
through
the
to
see
a
canadian
whom
she
does
know
and
who
does
want
to
see
her
from
two
places
away
i
heard
her
voice
piping
up
nurse
excuse
my
asking
but
is
your
cap
a
regulation
one
like
all
the
others
i
looked
up
and
all
the
tea
i
was
pouring
poured
over
the
edge
pettitt
and
captain
matthew
between
us
looked
down
at
their
plates
i
put
my
hand
to
my
cap
is
anything
wrong
it
ought
to
be
like
the
others
she
leant
towards
me
nodding
and
smiling
with
bonhomie
and
said
flatteringly
it
so
prettily
put
on
i
thought
it
was
different
and
then
horror
do
you
think
nurse
puts
her
cap
on
well
she
asked
captain
matthew
who
looking
harder
than
ever
at
his
plate
and
reddening
to
the
ears
mumbled
something
which
did
not
particularly
commit
him
since
it
could
be
heard
the
usual
delighted
silence
began
to
creep
round
the
table
and
i
tried
wildly
to
divert
her
attention
before
our
end
became
a
stage
and
the
rest
of
the
table
an
audience
i
think
it
so
nice
to
see
you
sitting
down
with
them
all
she
cooed
it
so
cosy
for
them
is
your
cup
empty
i
said
furiously
and
held
out
my
hand
for
it
but
it
was
of
course
she
could
even
do
that
for
me
she
shook
hands
with
me
when
she
went
away
and
said
she
hoped
to
come
again
and
she
will
there
was
once
a
lady
who
asked
me
very
loudly
whether
i
saw
many
horrible
sights
and
did
the
have
to
go
to
the
funerals
and
another
who
cried
out
with
emotion
when
she
saw
the
first
officer
limp
in
to
mess
and
can
some
of
them
then
perhaps
she
thought
they
came
in
to
tea
on
stretchers
with
on
she
quivered
all
over
too
as
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
i
feel
sure
she
went
home
and
broke
down
crying
what
an
experience
the
actual
wounds
shuffle
shuffle
up
the
corridor
as
i
was
laying
my
trays
captain
matthew
appeared
in
the
circle
of
light
his
arm
and
hand
bound
up
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
paused
by
me
well
he
said
companionably
and
lolled
against
a
pillar
you
done
well
at
tea
in
the
way
of
visitors
i
remarked
six
was
it
yes
he
said
and
now
i
got
rid
of
all
except
one
where
the
one
in
there
he
pointed
with
his
pipe
to
the
empty
he
the
father
of
a
subaltern
of
mine
who
was
killed
he
come
to
talk
to
you
about
it
yes
but
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
go
in
waiting
against
the
pillar
and
staring
at
the
moving
cutlery
he
waited
almost
three
minutes
then
he
sighed
and
went
in
biscuits
to
put
out
cheese
to
put
out
how
wet
this
new
cheese
is
and
fresh
and
good
the
little
bits
that
fall
off
the
edge
i
never
eat
cheese
at
home
but
here
the
breakings
are
like
manna
and
pears
with
the
old
shopman
trick
little
bitten
ones
at
the
bottom
fine
ones
at
the
top
soft
sugar
lump
sugar
coffee
as
one
stirs
the
coffee
round
in
the
tin
the
whole
room
smells
of
it
that
brown
burnt
smell
and
then
to
click
the
light
on
let
down
the
blind
stir
the
fire
close
the
door
of
the
little
bunk
and
looking
round
it
think
what
exhilaration
of
liberty
i
have
here
let
them
pile
on
the
rules
invent
and
insist
yet
behind
them
beneath
them
i
have
that
strong
secret
liberty
of
an
institution
that
runs
like
a
wind
in
me
and
lifts
my
mind
like
a
leaf
so
long
as
i
conform
absolutely
not
a
soul
will
glance
at
my
thoughts
few
at
my
face
i
have
only
to
be
silent
and
conform
and
i
might
be
in
so
far
a
land
that
even
the
eye
of
god
had
lost
me
i
took
the
plate
of
biscuits
the
two
plates
of
cheese
one
in
each
hand
and
one
balanced
with
a
new
skill
on
my
arm
and
carried
them
into
the
where
the
tables
were
already
laid
and
only
one
light
kept
on
as
yet
for
economy
sake
low
voices
there
in
the
dimmest
corner
sat
captain
matthew
his
chin
dug
deep
in
his
grey
and
beside
him
a
little
elderly
man
his
hat
on
his
knees
his
anxious
ordinary
face
turned
towards
the
light
a
citizen
a
baker
or
a
brewer
tinker
tailor
or
there
had
been
the
buying
of
the
uniform
the
visits
to
the
camp
in
england
the
parcels
to
send
out
always
the
parcels
week
by
week
and
now
nothing
no
more
parcels
no
more
letters
silence
only
the
last
hungry
pickings
from
captain
matthew
tired
memory
and
nervous
speech
i
turned
away
with
a
great
shrinking
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
citizen
went
past
my
bunk
door
his
hat
in
his
hand
his
black
coat
buttoned
taking
back
to
his
home
and
his
family
the
last
facts
that
he
might
ever
learn
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
almost
collided
with
that
stretcher
which
bears
a
flag
of
the
two
the
stretcher
moved
me
least
sister
is
afraid
of
death
she
told
me
so
and
not
the
less
afraid
she
said
after
all
she
has
seen
of
it
that
is
terrible
but
the
new
sister
is
afraid
of
life
she
is
the
rain
has
been
pouring
all
day
it
has
stopped
and
all
the
hill
is
steam
and
drizzle
and
black
with
the
blackness
that
war
has
thrust
upon
the
countryside
sister
has
gone
two
nights
ago
i
went
up
to
a
dinner
at
madeleine
and
to
stay
the
night
my
sister
said
go
and
enjoy
yourself
and
i
did
it
is
very
amusing
the
change
into
rooms
full
of
talk
and
light
i
feel
a
glow
of
pleasure
as
i
climb
to
the
room
madeleine
calls
mine
and
find
the
reflection
of
the
fire
on
the
blue
the
evening
was
remarkable
but
i
came
back
full
of
descriptions
to
the
bunk
and
sister
next
day
i
was
running
on
inventing
this
and
that
making
her
laugh
when
suddenly
i
looked
up
and
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
i
wavered
and
came
to
a
stop
she
got
up
suddenly
and
moved
about
the
room
and
then
with
a
muttered
wash
my
hands
disappeared
into
the
corridor
i
sat
and
thought
is
it
that
she
has
her
life
settled
quietly
continuous
and
one
breaks
in
does
the
wind
from
outside
hurt
i
regretted
it
all
the
evening
yesterday
i
arrived
at
the
hospital
and
could
find
the
keys
then
ran
across
to
her
room
and
tapped
at
the
door
her
voice
called
come
in
and
i
found
her
huddled
in
an
unnerved
and
white
i
asked
her
for
the
keys
and
when
she
gave
them
to
me
she
held
out
her
hand
and
said
i
going
away
they
are
sending
me
home
they
say
i
i
muttered
something
with
a
feeling
of
shock
and
going
back
to
my
bunk
i
brooded
the
new
sister
came
in
and
a
new
too
explaining
that
my
former
companion
was
now
going
into
a
ward
a
sense
of
desolation
was
in
the
air
a
ruthlessness
on
the
part
of
some
one
unknown
shuffle
shuffle
they
shuffle
us
like
cards
i
rose
and
began
to
teach
the
new
the
subtle
art
of
laying
trays
she
seemed
stupid
i
did
want
to
share
my
trays
with
her
i
love
them
they
are
my
recreation
i
hung
over
them
idly
hardly
laying
down
the
spoons
i
held
in
my
hand
but
standing
with
them
chivied
the
new
until
her
movements
became
flustered
and
her
eye
distraught
she
was
very
ugly
i
thought
in
a
day
or
two
i
shall
get
to
like
her
and
then
i
sha
be
able
to
chivy
her
out
in
the
corridor
came
a
tremendous
tramping
boots
and
jingling
metal
two
armed
men
with
fixed
bayonets
arrived
headed
by
a
sergeant
the
sergeant
paused
and
looked
uncertainly
this
way
and
that
and
then
at
me
i
guessed
their
destination
in
there
i
nodded
pointing
through
a
closed
glass
door
and
the
sergeant
marched
his
men
in
and
beyond
the
door
an
officer
had
been
brought
back
under
arrest
i
had
seen
him
pass
with
his
escort
the
rumour
at
tea
had
been
that
he
had
extended
his
two
days
leave
into
three
weeks
the
looked
at
me
questioningly
but
she
did
dare
and
i
could
bear
to
start
any
elucidations
on
the
subject
i
could
think
she
worried
me
her
odds
and
ends
of
conversation
pecked
at
me
like
a
small
bird
she
told
me
a
riddle
which
filled
me
with
nausea
and
finally
a
limerick
which
i
had
heard
three
times
in
the
mess
i
left
her
and
went
into
the
bunk
here
the
new
sister
had
installed
herself
gentle
and
pink
and
full
of
quiet
murmurs
the
rain
half
snow
half
sleet
dabbled
against
the
and
i
lifted
the
blind
to
watch
the
flakes
stick
and
melt
on
the
glass
the
her
trays
finished
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
little
room
seemed
full
of
people
there
a
concert
i
said
looking
at
the
with
distaste
she
looked
at
me
uncertainly
are
you
coming
no
i
said
i
a
note
to
write
forgetting
that
the
new
sister
might
not
allow
such
infringements
she
gave
no
sign
the
gave
in
and
disappeared
concertwards
the
sister
rose
too
and
went
out
into
the
kitchen
to
consult
with
the
i
slipped
out
behind
her
and
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
into
the
wet
dark
garden
down
the
channels
that
were
and
felt
my
way
over
to
the
sisters
quarters
my
sister
had
moved
there
by
the
her
thin
hand
to
her
face
she
sat
as
she
had
two
hours
before
come
in
she
offered
and
talk
to
me
her
collar
which
was
open
she
tried
to
do
up
it
made
a
painful
impression
on
me
of
weakness
and
the
effort
to
be
normal
i
remembered
that
she
had
once
told
me
she
was
so
afraid
of
death
and
i
guessed
that
she
was
suffering
now
from
that
terror
but
when
the
specialist
is
afraid
what
can
ignorance
say
life
in
the
bunk
is
wretched
except
that
the
new
tells
fortunes
by
hands
the
new
sister
is
at
the
same
time
timid
and
dogged
she
looks
at
me
with
a
sidelong
look
and
gives
me
little
flips
with
her
hand
as
though
she
thought
i
might
break
something
and
that
she
might
stave
it
off
by
playfulness
pain
to
stand
up
straight
on
one
feet
strong
easy
without
the
surging
of
any
physical
sensation
by
a
bedside
whose
coverings
are
flung
here
and
there
by
the
quivering
nerves
beneath
it
there
is
a
sort
of
shame
in
such
strength
what
can
i
do
for
you
my
eyes
cry
dumbly
into
his
clouded
brown
pupils
i
was
told
to
carry
trays
from
a
ward
where
i
had
never
been
before
just
to
carry
trays
orderly
work
no
more
no
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
his
knees
drawn
up
under
him
the
sheets
up
to
his
chin
his
flat
face
tilted
at
the
ceiling
as
i
bent
over
to
get
his
untouched
tray
his
tortured
brown
eyes
fell
on
me
i
in
pain
sister
he
said
no
one
has
ever
said
that
to
me
before
in
that
tone
he
gave
me
the
look
that
a
dog
gives
and
his
words
had
the
character
of
an
unformed
cry
he
was
quite
alone
at
the
end
of
the
ward
the
sister
was
in
her
bunk
my
white
cap
attracted
his
desperate
senses
as
he
spoke
his
knees
shot
out
from
under
him
with
his
restless
pain
his
right
arm
was
stretched
from
the
bed
in
a
narrow
iron
frame
reminding
me
of
a
hand
laid
along
a
harp
to
play
the
chords
the
fingers
with
their
swollen
green
flesh
extended
across
the
strings
but
of
this
harp
his
fingers
were
the
slave
not
the
master
shall
i
call
your
sister
i
whispered
to
him
he
shook
his
head
she
ca
do
anything
i
must
just
stick
it
out
they
going
to
operate
on
the
elbow
but
they
must
wait
three
days
first
his
head
turned
from
side
to
side
but
his
eyes
never
left
my
face
i
stood
by
him
helpless
overwhelmed
by
his
horrible
loneliness
then
i
carried
his
tray
down
the
long
ward
and
past
the
sister
bunk
within
by
the
fire
she
was
laughing
with
the
and
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
a
harmless
amusement
the
officer
in
no
says
he
in
great
pain
i
said
doubtfully
it
was
my
ward
and
sisters
are
funny
i
know
she
said
quite
decently
but
i
ca
do
anything
he
must
stick
it
out
i
looked
through
the
ward
door
once
or
twice
during
the
evening
and
still
his
knees
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
were
moving
up
and
down
it
must
happen
to
the
men
in
france
that
living
so
near
the
edge
of
death
they
are
more
aware
of
life
than
we
are
when
they
come
back
when
the
postwar
days
set
in
will
they
keep
that
vision
letting
it
play
on
life
or
must
it
fade
and
some
become
so
careless
of
life
so
careless
of
all
the
whims
and
personalities
and
desires
that
go
to
make
up
existence
that
one
wrote
to
me
the
only
real
waste
is
the
waste
of
metal
the
earth
will
be
covered
again
and
again
with
us
the
corn
will
grow
again
the
bread
and
meat
can
be
repeated
but
this
metal
that
has
lain
in
the
earth
for
centuries
the
formation
of
the
beginning
that
men
have
sweated
and
grubbed
for
that
is
the
waste
what
carelessness
of
worldly
success
they
should
bring
back
with
them
orderlies
come
and
go
up
and
down
the
corridor
often
they
carry
stretchers
now
and
then
a
stretcher
with
the
empty
folds
of
a
flag
flung
across
it
then
i
pause
from
laying
my
trays
and
with
a
bunch
of
forks
in
my
hand
i
stand
still
they
take
the
stretcher
into
a
ward
and
while
i
wait
i
know
what
they
are
doing
behind
the
screens
which
stand
around
a
bed
against
the
wall
i
hear
the
shuffle
of
feet
as
the
men
stand
to
attention
and
the
orderlies
come
out
again
and
the
folds
of
the
flag
have
ballooned
up
to
receive
and
embrace
a
man
body
where
is
he
going
to
the
mortuary
yes
but
where
else
perhaps
there
is
nothing
better
than
the
ecstasy
and
unappeasement
of
life
ii
inside
the
glass
doors
my
feet
ache
ache
ache
end
of
the
first
day
life
in
a
ward
is
all
scurry
and
rush
i
do
reflect
i
putting
on
my
cap
anyhow
and
my
hands
are
going
to
the
dogs
i
shall
never
get
to
understand
sisters
they
are
so
strange
so
tricky
uncertain
as
collies
deep
down
they
have
an
ineradicable
axiom
that
any
visitor
any
one
in
an
old
musquash
coat
in
a
collar
in
a
spotted
veil
tied
up
at
the
sides
any
one
with
whom
one
shakes
hands
or
takes
tea
is
more
important
than
the
most
charming
patient
except
of
course
a
warded
for
this
reason
the
mouths
of
the
are
all
turned
to
face
up
the
ward
away
from
the
door
i
think
plants
in
a
ward
are
a
barbarism
for
as
they
are
always
arranged
on
the
table
by
the
door
it
is
again
obvious
that
they
are
intended
only
to
minister
to
the
eye
of
the
visitor
that
race
of
gods
in
our
ward
there
are
eighteen
some
in
copper
some
in
pink
china
three
in
mauve
paper
and
one
hanging
basket
of
ferns
all
of
these
have
to
be
taken
out
on
the
landing
at
night
and
in
again
in
the
morning
and
they
have
to
be
soaked
under
the
tap
the
sisters
minds
are
as
yet
too
difficult
for
me
but
in
the
minds
of
the
i
see
certain
salient
features
i
see
already
manifested
in
them
the
ardent
longing
to
be
alike
i
know
and
remember
this
longing
it
was
present
through
all
my
early
years
in
a
large
but
there
it
was
naturally
corrected
by
the
changes
of
growth
and
the
inexpertness
of
youth
here
i
see
for
the
first
time
grown
women
trying
with
all
the
concentration
of
their
fuller
years
to
be
as
like
one
another
as
it
is
possible
to
be
there
is
a
certain
dreadful
innocence
about
them
too
as
though
each
would
protest
in
spite
of
our
tasks
our
often
immodest
tasks
our
minds
are
white
as
snow
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
their
conception
of
a
white
female
mind
is
the
silliest
most
mulish
incurious
unresponsive
condemning
kind
of
an
ideal
that
a
human
creature
could
set
before
it
at
present
i
am
so
humble
that
i
am
content
to
do
all
the
labour
and
take
none
of
the
temperatures
but
i
can
see
very
well
that
it
is
when
i
reach
a
higher
plane
that
all
the
trouble
will
begin
the
ranklings
the
the
gross
injustices
who
is
to
make
the
only
poultice
who
is
to
paint
the
very
septic
throat
of
mullins
army
service
corps
who
is
to
dizzy
splendour
go
round
with
the
should
the
sister
be
off
for
a
these
and
other
questions
will
form
the
pride
and
anguish
of
my
inner
life
it
is
wonderful
to
go
up
to
london
and
dine
and
stay
the
night
with
madeleine
after
the
hospital
the
hospital
a
sort
of
monotone
a
place
of
whispers
and
wheels
moving
on
rubber
tyres
long
corridors
and
strangely
unsexed
women
moving
in
them
unsexed
not
in
any
real
sense
but
the
white
clothes
the
hidden
hair
the
stern
white
collar
just
below
the
chin
give
them
an
air
of
an
air
and
a
look
women
do
wear
in
the
world
they
seem
unexpectant
then
at
madeleine
the
light
the
talk
the
deep
bath
got
ready
for
me
by
a
maid
instead
of
my
getting
it
ready
for
a
patient
not
that
i
mind
getting
it
ready
i
like
it
only
the
change
it
like
being
turn
and
turn
about
maid
and
mistress
there
is
the
first
snow
here
scanty
and
frozen
on
the
doorstep
i
came
home
last
night
in
the
dark
to
dinner
and
found
its
faint
traces
on
the
road
and
in
the
gutter
as
i
climbed
the
hill
i
could
see
well
there
were
stars
but
no
moon
higher
up
it
was
unmistakable
long
white
tracks
frozen
in
the
dried
mud
of
the
road
and
a
branch
under
a
lamp
thickened
with
frozen
snow
shall
i
ever
grow
out
of
that
excitement
over
the
first
bit
of
snow
i
felt
a
glow
of
pride
in
the
hill
thinking
in
london
it
all
slush
and
mud
they
do
suspect
what
we
got
here
a
suburb
is
a
wonderful
place
after
a
wet
and
muddy
day
in
london
i
seen
the
trains
pull
into
charing
cross
with
snow
piled
on
the
roofs
of
the
carriages
and
felt
a
foot
taller
for
joy
that
i
was
one
of
those
fortunates
who
might
step
into
a
train
and
go
down
into
a
white
countryside
it
is
the
same
excitement
to
wake
up
early
to
an
overnight
fall
and
see
down
the
dover
road
for
miles
no
foot
of
man
printed
but
only
the
birds
feet
considering
the
dover
road
has
been
a
highway
since
the
romans
it
really
is
a
fine
moment
when
you
realize
its
surface
has
suddenly
become
untrodden
and
unexplored
as
any
jungle
alas
the
amount
of
snow
that
has
set
me
writing
two
bucketfuls
in
the
whole
garden
when
a
medical
officer
goes
sick
or
in
other
words
when
an
is
warded
a
very
special
and
almost
cynical
expression
settles
on
his
face
also
the
bedside
manner
of
the
visiting
officer
is
discarded
as
he
reaches
the
bed
of
the
sick
my
knees
are
very
painful
says
the
sick
but
it
is
a
despondent
statement
not
a
plea
for
aid
the
visiting
officer
nods
but
he
does
not
suggest
that
they
will
soon
be
better
they
look
at
each
other
as
weak
human
beings
look
and
we
might
try
says
the
visiting
officer
questioningly
the
agrees
without
conviction
and
settles
back
on
his
pillows
not
for
him
the
comfortable
trust
in
the
divine
knowledge
of
specialists
he
can
endure
like
a
dog
but
without
its
faith
in
its
master
the
particular
whose
knees
are
painful
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
better
now
he
got
up
yesterday
mooning
about
the
ward
in
a
he
stared
first
out
of
one
window
into
the
fog
and
then
out
of
another
finally
just
before
he
got
back
into
bed
he
made
an
epigram
nurse
he
said
the
difference
between
being
in
bed
and
getting
up
is
that
in
bed
you
do
nothing
but
when
you
get
up
there
nothing
to
do
i
tucked
him
up
and
put
the
cradle
over
his
knees
and
he
added
one
gets
accustomed
to
everything
and
settled
back
happily
with
his
his
french
novel
and
his
dictionary
the
fog
developed
all
day
yesterday
piling
up
white
and
motionless
against
the
as
night
fell
a
little
air
of
excitement
ran
here
and
there
amongst
the
how
shall
we
get
home
are
the
buses
running
oh
no
the
last
one
is
stuck
against
the
railings
outside
my
torch
has
run
out
by
seven
even
the
long
corridor
was
as
dim
as
the
alley
outside
no
one
thought
of
shutting
the
windows
i
doubt
whether
they
will
shut
and
the
fog
rolled
over
the
sill
in
banks
and
round
the
open
glass
doors
till
even
the
white
cap
of
a
sister
could
hardly
be
seen
as
she
passed
i
am
pleased
with
any
atmospheric
exaggeration
the
adventure
of
going
home
was
before
me
at
eight
i
felt
my
way
down
over
the
steps
into
the
alley
the
torch
held
low
on
the
ground
lighted
but
a
small
pale
circle
round
my
shoes
outside
it
was
black
and
solid
and
strangely
quiet
in
the
yard
a
man
here
and
there
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
feet
strayed
near
mine
and
edged
away
at
the
i
came
on
a
lantern
standing
upon
the
ground
and
by
it
drooped
the
nose
of
a
benighted
horse
the
spurt
of
a
match
lit
the
face
of
its
owner
up
the
hill
the
torch
held
low
against
the
kerbstone
the
sudden
looming
of
a
black
giant
made
me
start
back
as
i
nearly
ran
my
head
into
a
i
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
fathoms
and
fathoms
of
fog
must
stand
above
my
head
suddenly
a
dozen
lights
showed
about
me
then
the
whole
sky
alight
with
stars
and
naked
trees
with
the
rime
on
them
bristling
the
long
road
ran
up
the
hill
its
accustomed
steel
colour
the
post
office
was
there
with
its
red
window
the
lean
old
with
its
broken
arm
i
had
walked
out
of
the
fog
as
one
walks
out
of
the
sea
on
to
a
beach
looking
back
i
could
see
the
pit
behind
me
the
fog
standing
on
the
road
like
a
solid
wall
straight
up
and
down
again
i
felt
a
pride
in
the
hill
down
there
i
thought
those
groping
feet
and
shouting
voices
that
man
and
that
horse
they
do
guess
i
walked
briskly
up
the
hill
and
presently
stepped
on
to
the
pavement
but
at
the
edge
of
the
asphalt
where
tufted
grass
should
grow
something
crackled
and
hissed
under
my
feet
under
the
torchlight
the
unnatural
grass
was
white
and
brittle
with
rime
fanciful
as
a
stage
fairy
scene
and
the
railings
beyond
it
glittered
too
i
slid
in
the
road
as
i
turned
down
the
drive
a
sheet
of
ice
was
spread
where
the
leaky
pipe
is
and
the
steps
up
to
the
house
door
were
slippery
but
oh
the
honeysuckle
and
the
bush
plant
leaf
stem
rimed
from
end
to
end
the
garden
was
a
bond
street
jeweller
perhaps
the
final
chapter
on
pettitt
in
the
excitement
of
the
ward
i
had
almost
forgotten
him
he
is
buried
in
the
mess
in
the
days
when
i
lived
on
the
floor
below
as
i
was
waiting
by
the
open
hatch
of
the
kitchen
for
my
tray
to
be
filled
with
little
castles
of
lemon
jelly
the
hot
blast
from
the
kitchen
drawing
stray
wisps
of
hair
from
beneath
my
cap
i
saw
the
familiar
limping
figure
a
figure
bound
up
with
my
first
days
at
the
hospital
evoking
a
hundred
evenings
at
the
concerts
in
the
i
felt
he
had
been
away
but
i
did
dare
risk
a
so
you
back
he
smiled
blushed
and
limped
past
me
upstairs
in
the
ward
as
i
was
serving
out
my
jellies
he
arrived
in
the
doorway
but
avoiding
me
hobbled
round
the
ward
visiting
every
bed
but
the
one
i
was
at
at
the
moment
then
he
went
downstairs
again
i
passed
him
on
the
stairs
he
ca
say
he
did
have
his
opportunity
for
i
even
stopped
with
my
heavy
tray
and
spoke
to
him
half
an
hour
later
he
was
back
in
the
ward
again
not
his
ward
and
this
time
he
found
the
courage
of
hysteria
there
in
the
middle
of
the
ward
under
the
glaring
christmas
lights
with
the
eyes
of
every
interested
man
in
every
bed
glued
upon
us
he
presented
me
with
a
fan
wrapped
in
white
paper
a
little
present
i
bought
you
nurse
i
took
it
eyes
sizzling
and
burning
holes
in
my
shoulders
and
stammered
my
frantic
thanks
you
do
like
it
nurse
he
said
rapidly
three
times
in
succession
and
i
i
do
i
do
i
do
i
thought
you
would
you
do
like
it
oh
just
what
i
wanted
that
all
right
then
just
a
little
christmas
present
we
could
stop
it
was
like
taking
too
much
butter
for
the
marmalade
and
too
much
marmalade
for
the
butter
he
leaves
the
hospital
in
a
day
or
two
the
fog
is
still
thick
at
the
station
after
a
day
off
i
found
it
white
and
silent
touching
the
arm
of
a
man
i
asked
him
the
question
are
the
buses
running
oh
no
and
the
cabs
all
gone
home
to
bed
and
i
was
hungry
what
ghosts
pass
and
voices
bodyless
talking
intimately
while
their
feet
fall
without
a
stir
on
the
grass
of
the
open
heath
i
was
excited
by
the
strange
silent
fog
but
my
left
shoe
began
to
hurt
me
and
stopping
at
the
house
of
a
girl
i
knew
i
borrowed
a
country
pair
of
hers
no
taller
than
i
she
takes
two
sizes
larger
they
were
like
boats
i
started
to
trudge
the
three
miles
home
in
the
boats
the
slightest
flick
of
the
foot
would
have
sent
one
of
them
flying
beyond
the
eye
of
god
or
man
after
a
couple
of
miles
the
shoes
began
to
tell
and
i
stood
still
and
lifted
up
one
foot
behind
me
craning
over
my
shoulder
to
see
if
i
could
catch
sight
of
the
glimmer
of
skin
through
the
heel
of
the
stocking
the
fog
was
too
thick
for
that
another
and
i
put
my
finger
down
to
my
heel
and
felt
the
wet
blood
through
a
large
hole
in
my
stocking
so
i
took
off
the
shoes
and
tied
them
together
and
more
silent
than
ever
in
the
tomb
of
fog
padded
along
as
god
had
first
supposed
that
woman
would
walk
on
the
wet
surface
of
the
road
a
warded
is
pathetic
he
knows
he
ca
get
well
quicker
than
time
will
let
him
he
has
no
faith
i
have
to
take
down
all
the
decorations
that
i
put
up
for
christmas
when
i
put
them
up
i
never
thought
i
should
be
the
one
to
take
them
down
when
i
was
born
no
one
thought
i
should
be
old
while
i
was
untying
a
piece
of
holly
from
the
cords
on
the
ceiling
and
a
patient
was
holding
the
ladder
for
me
a
young
came
and
pretended
to
help
us
but
while
he
stood
with
us
he
whispered
to
the
patient
are
you
a
communicant
i
felt
a
wave
of
heat
and
anger
i
could
have
dropped
the
holly
on
him
they
hung
up
their
stockings
on
christmas
night
on
hitched
over
the
ends
of
the
beds
and
under
the
mattresses
such
big
stockings
many
of
them
must
have
played
father
christmas
in
their
own
homes
to
their
own
children
on
other
christmases
on
christmas
eve
i
did
leave
the
hospital
till
long
after
the
had
gone
and
the
came
on
the
wards
were
all
quiet
as
i
walked
down
the
corridor
and
to
left
and
right
through
the
glass
doors
hung
the
rows
of
expectant
stockings
final
and
despairing
postscript
on
pettitt
when
a
woman
says
she
can
not
come
to
lunch
it
is
because
she
want
to
let
this
serve
as
an
axiom
to
every
lover
a
woman
who
refuses
lunch
refuses
everything
the
hospital
is
alive
i
feel
it
like
a
living
being
the
hospital
is
like
a
dream
i
am
afraid
of
waking
up
and
finding
it
commonplace
the
white
sisters
the
patients
the
long
passages
the
sudden
plunges
into
the
brilliant
wards
their
scenery
hypnotizes
me
sometimes
in
the
late
evening
one
walks
busily
up
and
down
the
ward
doing
this
and
that
forgetting
that
there
is
anything
beyond
the
drawn
blinds
engrossed
in
the
patients
one
tasks
washing
one
errand
and
another
and
then
suddenly
a
blind
will
blow
out
and
almost
up
to
the
ceiling
and
through
it
you
will
catch
a
glimpse
that
makes
you
gasp
of
a
black
night
crossed
with
bladed
searchlights
of
a
moon
behind
a
crooked
tree
the
lifting
of
the
blind
is
a
miracle
i
do
not
believe
in
the
wind
a
new
sister
on
very
severe
we
had
to
make
the
beds
like
white
cardboard
i
wonder
what
she
thinks
of
me
pettitt
who
really
is
going
wandered
up
into
the
ward
and
limped
near
me
sister
he
began
he
call
me
sister
i
frowned
at
him
the
new
sister
glanced
at
him
and
blinked
he
was
very
persistent
sister
he
said
again
do
you
think
i
can
have
a
word
with
you
not
now
i
whispered
as
i
hurried
past
him
oh
is
that
so
he
said
as
though
i
had
made
an
interesting
statement
and
limped
away
looking
backwards
at
me
i
suppose
he
wants
to
say
he
sat
beside
wicks
bed
wicks
who
is
paralysed
and
looked
at
me
from
time
to
time
with
that
stare
of
his
which
contains
so
little
offence
it
is
curious
to
think
that
i
once
saw
wicks
on
a
walking
across
the
grass
wicks
who
will
never
put
his
foot
on
grass
again
but
lying
in
his
bed
continues
to
say
as
all
tommies
say
i
feel
well
in
meself
so
he
does
he
feels
well
in
himself
but
he
is
going
to
live
all
the
same
still
his
routine
goes
on
he
plays
his
game
of
cards
he
has
his
joke
lemonade
please
nurse
but
it
not
from
choice
when
i
go
to
clear
his
at
night
i
always
say
well
now
got
something
worth
clearing
at
last
and
he
chuckles
and
answers
thought
you
be
pleased
it
the
others
gets
round
my
bed
and
leaves
their
bits
he
was
once
a
sergeant
he
got
his
commission
a
year
ago
my
ruined
charms
cry
aloud
for
help
the
cap
wears
away
my
front
hair
my
feet
are
widening
from
the
everlasting
boards
my
hands
wo
take
my
rings
i
was
advised
last
night
on
the
telephone
to
marry
immediately
before
it
was
too
late
a
desperate
remedy
i
will
try
cold
cream
and
hair
tonics
first
there
is
a
tuberculosis
ward
across
the
landing
they
call
it
the
ward
it
is
a
den
of
coughs
and
harrowing
noises
one
night
i
saw
a
negro
standing
in
the
doorway
with
his
long
hair
done
up
in
hairpins
he
is
the
pet
of
the
ward
they
call
him
henry
henry
came
in
to
help
us
with
our
christmas
decorations
on
christmas
eve
and
as
he
cleverly
made
wreaths
my
sister
whispered
to
me
never
spitting
in
the
ward
but
he
was
it
was
part
of
his
language
little
clicks
and
ticks
he
comes
from
somewhere
in
central
africa
and
one
of
the
told
me
he
only
got
one
wife
nurse
he
is
very
proud
of
his
austerity
for
he
has
somehow
discovered
that
he
has
hit
on
a
country
where
it
is
the
nutty
thing
only
to
have
one
wife
no
one
can
speak
a
word
of
his
language
no
one
knows
exactly
where
he
comes
from
but
he
can
say
in
english
good
morning
sister
and
christmas
box
and
one
directly
one
takes
any
notice
of
him
he
laughs
and
clicks
holding
up
one
finger
crying
one
then
a
proud
they
regard
him
as
the
creator
might
regard
a
explains
he
means
he
only
got
one
wife
nurse
then
he
did
his
second
trick
he
came
to
me
with
outstretched
black
hand
and
took
my
apron
fingering
it
its
whiteness
slipped
between
his
fingers
he
dropped
it
and
holding
up
the
hand
with
its
fellow
ducked
his
head
to
watch
me
with
his
glinting
eyes
he
means
explained
the
versatile
that
he
has
ten
piccaninnies
in
his
village
and
they
all
dressed
in
white
it
took
my
breath
away
i
looked
at
henry
for
corroboration
he
nodded
earnestly
coughed
and
whispered
ten
how
do
you
know
he
means
that
i
asked
how
can
you
possibly
have
found
out
we
got
pictures
nurse
we
showed
kids
and
said
got
ten
six
girls
and
four
boys
we
showed
pictures
of
kids
i
had
never
seen
henry
before
never
knew
he
existed
but
in
the
ward
opposite
the
poor
had
been
holding
conversations
with
him
in
showing
him
pictures
painfully
establishing
a
communion
with
him
henry
with
his
hair
done
up
in
hairpins
although
they
showed
him
off
with
conscious
pride
i
do
think
he
really
appeared
strange
to
them
beyond
his
colour
i
believe
they
imagine
his
wife
as
appearing
much
as
their
own
wives
his
children
as
the
little
children
who
run
about
their
own
doorsteps
they
do
not
stretch
their
imaginations
to
conceive
any
strangeness
about
his
home
surroundings
to
correspond
with
his
own
strangeness
to
them
henry
has
the
dignity
of
a
man
and
a
householder
possibly
a
he
seems
quite
happy
and
amused
i
see
him
carrying
a
bucket
sometimes
sharing
its
handle
with
a
flushed
they
carry
on
animated
conversations
as
they
go
downstairs
the
talking
the
most
it
reminds
me
of
a
child
and
a
dog
what
strange
machinery
is
there
for
getting
him
back
part
of
the
cargo
of
a
ship
one
day
a
nigger
for
central
africa
where
his
unit
who
knows
one
nigger
and
his
bundle
for
central
africa
the
ward
has
put
wicks
to
coventry
because
he
has
been
abusive
and
for
three
days
he
lies
flat
in
his
bed
and
frowns
no
more
jokes
over
the
lemonade
no
wilfulness
over
the
thermometer
it
is
in
these
days
that
wicks
faces
the
truth
i
lingered
by
his
bed
last
night
after
i
had
put
his
on
his
table
and
looked
down
at
him
he
pretended
to
be
inanimate
his
open
eyes
fixed
upon
the
white
rail
of
the
bed
his
bedclothes
were
stretched
about
him
as
though
he
had
not
moved
since
his
bed
was
made
hours
before
his
worldly
pleasures
were
beside
him
his
his
christmas
box
of
cigars
his
but
his
eyes
disregarding
them
were
upon
that
sober
vision
that
hung
around
the
bedrail
he
began
a
bitter
conversation
nurse
i
only
a
ranker
but
i
had
a
bit
saved
i
went
to
a
private
doctor
and
paid
for
myself
and
i
went
to
a
specialist
and
he
told
me
i
should
never
get
this
i
paid
for
it
myself
out
of
what
i
had
saved
we
might
have
been
alone
in
the
world
he
and
i
far
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
men
sat
crouched
about
the
fire
their
trays
before
them
on
chairs
the
sheet
of
window
behind
wicks
head
was
flecked
with
the
morsels
of
snow
which
hunted
by
the
gale
obtained
a
refuge
before
oblivion
i
sooner
be
dead
than
lying
here
i
would
reely
you
hear
that
often
in
the
world
i
sooner
be
dead
than
but
wicks
meant
it
he
would
sooner
be
dead
than
lying
there
and
death
is
a
horror
an
end
yet
he
says
lying
there
is
worse
you
see
i
paid
for
a
specialist
myself
and
he
told
me
i
should
never
be
like
this
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
one
must
have
one
tea
i
went
down
the
ward
to
the
bunk
and
we
cut
the
pink
iced
cake
left
over
from
christmas
i
did
not
mean
to
forget
him
but
i
forgot
him
from
birth
to
death
we
are
alone
but
one
of
the
sisters
remembered
him
wicks
is
still
in
the
dumps
she
remarked
what
is
really
the
matter
with
him
sister
locomotor
ataxy
and
she
added
as
she
drank
her
tea
it
his
own
fault
oh
hush
hush
my
heart
cried
soundlessly
to
her
you
ca
judge
the
bitterness
of
this
nun
from
your
convent
alas
mr
wicks
no
wonder
you
saved
your
money
to
spend
upon
specialists
how
many
years
have
you
walked
in
fear
of
this
he
took
your
money
the
gentleman
in
harley
street
and
told
you
that
you
might
go
in
peace
he
blessed
you
and
gave
you
salvation
and
the
bitterest
thing
of
all
is
that
you
paid
for
him
like
an
officer
and
he
was
wrong
how
the
blinds
blew
and
the
windows
shook
i
walked
out
of
the
hospital
into
a
gale
clouds
driving
to
the
sea
trees
bending
back
and
fore
across
the
moon
i
walked
till
i
was
warm
and
then
i
walked
for
happiness
the
maddening
shine
of
the
moon
held
my
eyes
and
i
walked
in
the
road
like
a
fool
watching
her
till
at
last
bringing
my
eyes
down
the
were
small
as
blades
of
grass
on
the
and
the
shining
ribbon
tracks
in
the
mud
on
the
road
ran
up
the
hill
for
ever
they
go
to
dover
and
dover
is
france
and
france
leads
anywhere
to
what
a
lost
enchantment
am
i
recalled
by
the
sight
of
a
branch
across
the
moon
something
in
childhood
something
which
escapes
yet
does
not
wither
as
i
passed
the
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
all
black
and
white
in
the
cold
moonlight
a
heavy
door
swung
open
and
with
a
cough
and
a
deep
satisfied
snuffle
a
man
coming
out
let
a
stream
of
gaslight
across
the
road
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
certainly
go
to
all
that
polished
brass
and
glass
boxed
up
away
from
the
moon
and
the
shadows
would
call
to
me
and
to
drink
must
be
a
happy
thing
when
you
have
climbed
the
hill
the
ward
is
a
melancholy
place
there
is
a
man
in
a
bed
near
the
door
who
lies
with
his
mouth
open
his
head
is
like
a
beneath
a
muslin
cloth
i
saw
him
behind
his
screens
when
i
took
them
over
a
little
lukewarm
chicken
left
from
our
dinner
there
was
a
dark
red
moon
and
frost
our
orderly
said
you
can
tell
it
freezing
nurse
by
the
breath
as
he
watched
mine
curl
up
in
smoke
in
the
icy
corridor
i
like
people
who
notice
things
out
in
the
road
in
front
of
the
hospital
i
could
get
the
to
work
and
sat
crouched
in
the
dark
fiddling
with
spanners
the
charwomen
came
out
of
the
big
gate
in
the
dark
talking
and
laughing
all
in
a
bunch
one
of
them
stepped
off
the
pavement
near
me
and
stopped
to
put
her
toe
through
the
ice
in
the
gutter
nah
come
on
mrs
toms
i
always
to
break
it
it
ser
nice
an
stiff
she
said
as
she
ran
after
them
to
be
a
sister
is
to
have
a
nationality
as
there
are
icelanders
urbane
witty
lazy
and
yet
they
are
all
icelanders
so
there
are
cold
uproarious
observant
subservient
slangy
sympathetic
indifferent
and
scotch
sisters
and
yet
sister
said
of
a
patient
he
was
a
funny
man
a
funny
man
is
a
man
who
is
a
dark
horse
who
is
neither
friendly
nor
antagonistic
who
is
witty
who
is
preoccupied
who
is
whimsical
or
erratic
funny
qualities
unsafe
qualities
no
sister
could
like
a
funny
man
in
our
ward
there
are
three
sorts
of
men
nothing
much
nice
boys
and
wicks
the
last
looms
even
to
the
mind
of
the
sister
as
a
biblical
figure
a
pillar
of
salt
a
witness
to
god
wrath
the
sister
is
a
of
such
phrases
as
indeed
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
we
shall
see
it
is
possible
i
have
discovered
a
new
and
for
me
charming
game
which
i
play
with
my
sister
it
is
the
game
of
telling
the
truth
about
the
contents
of
my
mind
when
asked
yesterday
sister
was
trying
to
get
some
coal
out
of
the
with
a
shovel
that
turned
round
and
round
on
its
handle
she
was
unsuccessful
i
said
let
me
sister
she
said
why
and
i
because
i
think
i
can
do
it
better
why
should
you
think
that
because
all
human
beings
do
i
said
and
luckily
she
smiled
she
was
washing
her
caps
out
in
a
bowl
in
the
afternoon
when
i
came
on
good
afternoon
sister
i
said
ironing
i
am
obviously
only
washing
as
yet
she
said
it
because
i
think
so
quickly
sister
i
said
i
knew
you
would
iron
next
i
dined
with
irene
last
night
after
the
hospital
i
refused
to
believe
what
she
told
me
about
the
last
bus
passing
at
nine
and
so
at
a
quarter
to
ten
i
stood
outside
the
green
lamp
and
waited
ten
minutes
passed
and
no
bus
with
me
were
two
women
waiting
too
one
holding
a
baby
the
other
younger
smarter
dangling
a
purse
at
last
i
communicated
my
growing
fears
i
believe
the
last
has
gone
we
fixed
our
six
eyes
on
the
far
corner
of
the
road
waiting
for
the
yellow
lights
to
round
it
but
only
the
stood
firm
in
their
perspective
oh
my
elsie
said
the
woman
with
the
baby
you
ca
never
walk
up
to
the
in
the
dark
alone
i
would
make
the
attempt
not
for
anything
replied
the
younger
one
firmly
without
waiting
for
more
i
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
road
and
started
on
my
walk
home
the
very
next
sentence
would
have
suggested
that
elsie
and
i
should
walk
together
she
would
make
the
attempt
her
words
trailed
through
my
mind
conjuring
up
some
adventure
some
act
of
bravery
and
daring
the
road
was
the
high
road
the
channel
of
tarmac
and
pavements
that
she
probably
walked
along
every
day
and
now
it
was
the
selfsame
high
road
the
same
flagstones
hedges
railings
but
with
the
cloak
of
night
upon
them
it
was
man
she
feared
even
in
the
dark
i
knew
she
was
that
kind
she
would
be
awfully
capable
with
man
no
it
was
the
darkness
the
spooky
jungle
of
darkness
she
feared
the
trees
would
move
i
would
make
the
attempt
not
for
anything
and
the
other
woman
had
quite
agreed
with
her
i
knew
where
i
was
by
the
smells
and
the
sounds
on
the
road
the
smell
of
the
lines
of
picketed
horses
behind
the
railings
the
sharp
and
sudden
stamp
of
the
sick
ones
in
the
wooden
stables
and
later
on
the
glitter
of
water
in
the
i
thought
i
am
not
afraid
is
it
because
i
am
more
educated
or
have
less
imagination
halt
who
goes
there
friend
i
said
thrilling
tremendously
he
approached
me
and
said
something
which
i
could
make
anything
of
presently
i
disentangled
you
should
never
dread
the
baynit
miss
but
i
not
dreading
i
said
annoyed
i
i
love
it
he
said
he
was
cold
and
added
i
bin
wounded
if
you
come
to
that
lamp
you
can
see
me
stripe
we
went
to
the
lamp
it
them
buses
he
complained
they
wo
stop
when
i
halt
but
why
do
you
want
to
stop
them
they
ca
poison
the
it
me
duty
he
said
there
one
comin
a
bus
coming
the
opposite
way
bore
down
upon
us
with
an
unwieldy
rush
and
roar
the
last
bus
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
bed
you
see
he
said
pessimistically
there
the
bus
with
three
soldiers
hanging
on
the
step
rushed
past
us
and
seemed
to
slow
a
little
the
sentry
ran
a
few
paces
towards
it
crying
but
it
gathered
speed
and
boomed
on
again
buzzing
away
between
the
he
returned
to
me
sadly
i
do
believe
they
can
hear
i
said
and
gave
him
some
chocolates
and
went
on
as
i
passed
the
hospital
gates
it
seemed
there
was
a
faint
a
very
faint
sweet
smell
of
chloroform
i
was
down
at
the
hospital
when
the
factory
blew
up
over
the
river
the
lights
went
out
and
as
they
sank
i
reached
the
kitchen
hatchway
with
my
tray
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
could
see
through
the
garden
door
the
sky
grown
sulphur
and
the
bushes
glowing
while
all
the
panes
of
glass
turned
incandescent
then
the
explosion
came
it
sounded
as
though
it
was
just
behind
the
hospital
two
hundred
panes
of
glass
fell
out
and
they
made
a
noise
too
standing
in
the
dark
with
a
tray
in
my
hand
i
heard
a
man
voice
saying
gleefully
i
have
been
out
of
bed
this
two
months
some
one
lit
a
candle
and
by
its
light
i
saw
all
the
charwomen
from
the
kitchen
bending
about
like
broken
weeds
and
every
officer
was
saying
there
there
now
we
watched
the
fires
till
midnight
from
the
hill
i
went
over
this
morning
early
we
were
in
a
carriage
lascars
chinese
children
jews
niggers
from
the
docks
lascars
and
children
and
jews
and
i
we
fought
to
get
off
the
station
platform
sometimes
there
was
room
on
the
ground
for
both
my
feet
at
once
the
fires
were
still
burning
and
smouldering
there
at
midday
but
a
shower
of
rime
fell
on
it
so
that
it
looked
like
an
old
ruin
something
done
long
ago
at
pompeii
some
one
told
me
one
looked
into
the
rooms
and
they
were
as
they
had
been
left
tables
laid
here
too
i
saw
a
table
laid
for
the
evening
meal
with
a
bedstead
fallen
from
the
upper
floor
astraddle
across
it
the
insides
of
the
houses
were
coughed
into
their
windows
hanging
to
the
sills
and
outside
the
soil
of
the
earth
turned
up
a
workman
tin
mug
stuck
and
roasted
and
hardened
into
what
looks
like
solid
rock
a
fossil
as
though
it
had
been
there
for
ever
london
is
only
beneath
lies
the
body
of
the
world
the
hump
under
the
blankets
rolls
over
and
a
man
solemn
face
appears
upon
the
pillow
can
you
get
me
a
book
nurse
yes
what
kind
do
you
like
nothing
fanciful
something
that
might
be
true
all
right
oh
and
nurse
yes
not
sentimental
and
not
funny
i
like
a
practical
story

got
him

voice
nurse

there
any
modern
french
poetry
in
that
bookcase
good
heavens
no
who
would
have
brought
it
here
who
are
they
all
these
men
with
their
differing
tastes
perhaps
the
angels
feel
like
this
as
they
trail
about
in
heaven
with
their
wings
flapping
on
their
thin
white
legs
who
were
you
angel
i
was
a
beggar
outside
san
marco

you
how
odd
i
was
an
englishman
the
concerts
that
we
give
in
the
ward
touch
me
with
some
curious
emotion
i
think
it
is
because
i
am
for
once
at
rest
in
the
ward
and
have
time
to
think
and
wonder
there
is
captain
thomson
finishing
his
song
he
does
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
they
swing
he
is
tall
and
dark
with
soft
eyes
and
staff
badges
could
one
guess
what
he
is
never
in
a
dozen
years
but
i
he
said
to
me
last
night
nurse
i
going
out
i
leant
across
the
table
to
listen
to
him
nurse
if
you
ever
want
any
de
for
nightgowns
mind
at
wholesale
prices
i
have
bought
some
at
a
sale
may
i
ask
at
what
price
a
yard
pity
you
could
have
had
it
from
me
at
three
he
gave
me
his
business
card
that
it
nurse
he
said
as
he
wrote
on
the
back
of
it
drop
me
a
line
to
that
address
and
you
get
any
material
for
underwear
at
trade
prices
he
booked
one
or
two
orders
the
night
he
went
away
not
laughingly
not
as
a
joke
but
with
deep
seriousness
and
gravely
pleased
that
he
was
able
to
do
what
he
could
for
us
he
was
a
traveller
in
underwear
i
have
seldom
met
any
one
so
little
a
snob
watch
gray
singing
one
hand
on
the
piano
one
on
his
hip
i
love
every
mouse
in
that
house
that
fellow
can
sing
whispers
the
man
beside
me
is
he
a
professional
i
asked
as
finishing
the
singer
made
the
faintest
of
bows
and
walked
back
to
his
chair
i
think
he
must
be
he
is
he
is
whispered
matthews
i
heard
him
before
they
know
so
little
about
each
other
and
they
do
ask
it
is
only
i
who
wonder
i
a
woman
and
therefore
of
the
old
world
these
men
watch
without
curiosity
speak
no
personalities
form
no
sets
express
no
likings
analyse
nothing
they
are
they
have
as
yet
no
standards
and
do
not
look
for
any
ah
to
have
had
that
experience
too
i
am
of
the
old
world
again
and
again
i
realize
a
nation
in
arms
watchmakers
jewellers
actors
travellers
in
underwear
bank
clerks
they
come
here
in
uniforms
and
we
put
them
into
pyjamas
and
nurse
them
and
they
lie
in
bed
or
hobble
about
the
ward
watching
us
as
we
move
accepting
each
other
with
the
unquestioning
faith
of
children
the
outside
world
has
faded
since
i
have
been
in
the
hospital
their
world
is
often
near
me
their
mud
and
trenches
things
they
say
when
they
come
in
wounded
the
worst
of
it
is
it
almost
bores
me
to
go
to
london
and
london
was
always
my
mecca
it
is
this
garden
at
home
i
think
it
is
so
easy
not
to
leave
it
when
you
wake
up
the
window
is
full
of
branches
and
last
thing
at
night
the
moon
is
on
the
snow
on
the
lawn
and
you
can
see
the
footmarks
then
one
goes
to
the
hospital
when
madeleine
telephones
to
me
i
living
in
a
whirl
it
disturbs
me
suddenly
i
want
to
too
but
it
dies
down
again
not
that
it
is
their
world
those
trenches
when
they
come
in
wounded
or
sick
they
say
at
once
what
shows
are
on
wicks
has
ceased
to
read
those
magazines
his
sister
sends
him
he
now
stares
all
day
at
his
white
bedrail
i
only
pass
him
on
my
way
to
the
twice
an
evening
and
then
as
i
glance
at
him
i
am
set
wondering
all
down
the
ward
of
what
he
thinks
or
if
he
thinks
i
may
be
quite
wrong
about
him
it
is
possible
he
does
think
at
all
but
stares
himself
into
some
happier
dream
one
day
when
he
is
dead
when
he
is
as
totally
dead
as
he
tells
me
he
hopes
to
be
that
bed
with
its
haunted
bedrail
will
bend
under
another
man
weight
surely
it
must
be
haunted
the
weight
of
thought
dream
or
nightmare
that
hangs
about
it
now
is
almost
visible
to
me
wicks
is
an
uneducated
and
ordinary
man
in
what
manner
does
his
dream
run
since
he
has
ceased
to
read
he
has
begun
to
drop
away
a
little
from
my
living
understanding
he
reflects
deeply
at
times
as
i
went
quickly
past
him
with
my
load
of
his
blind
flapped
a
little
and
i
saw
the
moon
shaped
like
a
horn
behind
it
dropping
my
towels
i
pulled
his
blind
back
wicks
look
at
the
moon
obedient
as
one
who
receives
an
order
he
reached
up
to
his
supporting
handle
and
pulled
his
shoulders
half
round
in
bed
to
look
with
me
through
the
pane
the
young
moon
freed
from
the
trees
was
rising
over
the
hill
i
dropped
the
blind
again
and
took
up
my
towels
and
left
him
after
that
he
seemed
to
fall
into
one
of
his
trances
and
lay
immovable
an
hour
or
more
when
i
took
his
dinner
to
him
he
lifted
his
large
sandy
head
and
said
seems
a
queer
thing
that
if
you
had
said
at
the
moon
i
might
have
bin
dead
without
seeing
her
but
do
you
ever
look
out
of
the
window
the
obstinate
man
shook
his
head
there
was
a
long
silence
in
the
ward
it
was
so
cold
that
no
one
spoke
it
is
a
gloomy
ward
i
think
the
pink
silk
on
the
electric
lights
is
so
much
too
thick
and
the
fire
smokes
dreadfully
the
patients
sat
round
the
fire
with
their
british
warms
over
their
and
the
collars
turned
up
through
the
two
glass
doors
and
over
the
landing
you
can
see
the
moving
like
little
cinema
figures
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
lighted
entrance
suddenly
a
hesitating
touch
an
ancient
polka
struck
up
a
tune
remembered
at
children
parties
then
a
waltz
a
very
old
one
too
the
were
playing
dance
music
i
crept
to
their
door
and
looked
one
man
alone
was
taking
any
notice
and
he
was
the
player
the
others
sat
round
coughing
or
staring
at
nothing
in
particular
and
those
in
bed
had
their
heads
turned
away
from
the
music
the
man
whose
face
is
like
a
has
now
more
than
ever
a
look
of
an
empty
cage
he
allows
his
mouth
to
hang
open
that
way
the
bird
will
fly
what
is
there
so
rapturous
about
the
moon
the
radiance
of
a
floating
moon
is
unbelievable
it
is
a
figment
of
dream
the
ball
that
hung
at
the
top
of
the
christmas
tree
or
earlier
still
the
shining
thing
necklace
or
spoon
the
thing
the
baby
leans
to
catch
the
magpie
in
us
beecher
is
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
till
eight
he
sleeps
so
badly
he
says
he
woke
up
crying
this
morning
for
he
has
neurasthenia
that
is
what
sister
says
he
should
have
been
in
bed
all
yesterday
but
instead
he
got
up
and
through
the
door
watched
the
dead
ride
away
on
his
stretcher
for
the
bird
flew
in
the
night
how
morbid
of
him
sister
says
he
has
seen
many
dead
in
france
and
snapped
his
fingers
at
them
but
i
agree
with
him
that
to
die
of
tuberculosis
in
the
backwaters
of
the
war
is
the
same
thing
it
dreary
he
thought
how
dreary
it
was
as
he
lay
awake
in
the
night
but
then
he
has
neurasthenia
pity
is
exhaustible
what
a
terrible
discovery
if
one
ceases
for
one
instant
to
pity
wicks
he
becomes
an
awful
bore
some
days
when
the
sun
is
shining
i
hear
his
grieving
tenor
voice
all
over
the
ward
his
legendary
tale
of
a
wrong
done
him
in
his
promotion
the
men
are
kind
to
him
and
say
old
man
but
gray
who
lies
in
the
next
bed
to
him
is
drained
of
everything
except
resignation
i
heard
him
say
yesterday
you
told
me
that
before
we
had
a
convoy
last
night
there
was
a
rumour
at
and
suddenly
i
came
round
a
corner
on
an
orderly
full
of
such
definite
information
as
there
thirty
officers
nurse
an
an
eighty
men
i
flew
back
to
the
bunk
with
the
news
and
we
sat
down
to
our
tea
wondering
and
discussing
how
many
each
ward
would
get
presently
the
haughty
sister
from
downstairs
came
to
the
door
she
held
her
thin
white
face
high
and
her
rimless
glasses
gleamed
as
she
remarked
overcasually
after
asking
for
a
bottle
that
had
been
loaned
to
us
have
you
many
beds
have
they
many
beds
the
one
question
that
starts
up
among
the
competing
wards
and
i
do
want
any
i
enough
to
do
as
it
is
is
the
false
cloaking
answer
that
each
sister
gives
to
the
other
but
my
sisters
are
frank
women
they
laughed
at
my
excitement
themselves
not
unstirred
it
so
long
since
we
had
a
convoy
the
gallants
of
the
ward
showed
annoyance
new
men
new
interests
they
drew
together
and
played
bridge
a
little
flying
boy
with
bright
eyes
said
in
his
high
piping
voice
to
me
across
the
ward
so
there
are
soldiers
coming
into
the
ward
i
paused
struck
by
his
accusing
eyes
what
do
you
mean
soldiers
i
mean
men
who
have
been
to
the
front
nurse
the
gallants
raised
their
eyebrows
and
grew
uproarious
the
gallants
have
been
saying
unprofessional
things
to
me
and
i
minded
the
convoy
will
arm
me
against
them
soldiers
are
coming
into
the
ward
eight
nine
if
only
one
could
eat
something
i
took
a
out
of
a
tin
resolving
to
pay
it
back
out
of
my
tea
next
day
and
stole
round
to
the
dark
corner
near
the
german
ward
to
eat
it
the
germans
were
in
bed
i
could
see
two
of
them
at
last
freed
from
their
uniform
the
dark
blue
with
the
scarlet
they
looked
how
strange
like
other
men
one
was
asleep
the
other
i
met
his
eyes
so
close
but
i
was
in
the
dark
and
he
under
the
light
of
a
lamp
i
knew
what
was
happening
down
at
the
station
two
miles
away
i
had
been
on
station
duty
so
often
the
rickety
country
station
lit
by
one
large
lamp
the
thirteen
waiting
the
long
wooden
table
loaded
with
mugs
of
every
size
kettles
boiling
the
white
clock
ticking
on
that
frowsy
booking
clerk
then
the
sharp
bell
the
tramp
of
the
through
the
station
and
at
last
the
two
engines
drawing
gravely
across
the
lighted
doorway
and
carriage
windows
filled
with
eager
faces
other
carriage
windows
with
beds
slung
across
them
a
vast
red
cross
a
chemist
shop
a
theatre
more
windows
more
faces
the
are
lined
up
the
meets
the
with
the
train
the
train
sisters
drift
in
to
the
here
they
come
walkers
first
the
station
entrance
is
full
of
men
crowding
in
and
taking
the
steaming
mugs
of
tea
and
coffee
men
on
pickaback
with
bandaged
feet
men
with
only
a
nose
and
one
eye
showing
with
stumbling
legs
bound
arms
the
station
for
five
minutes
is
full
of
jokes
and
witticisms
then
they
pass
out
and
into
the
waiting
a
long
pause
stretchers
the
first
stretchers
are
laid
on
the
floor
there
i
have
stood
so
often
pouring
the
tea
behind
the
table
watching
that
littered
floor
the
single
ever
revolving
on
its
chain
turning
the
shadows
about
the
room
like
a
wheel
my
mind
filled
with
pictures
emptied
of
thoughts
hypnotized
but
last
night
for
the
first
time
i
was
in
the
ward
for
the
first
time
i
should
follow
them
beyond
the
glass
door
see
what
became
of
them
how
they
changed
from
soldiers
into
patients
the
gallants
in
the
ward
do
like
a
convoy
it
unsexes
us
nine
ten
another
biscuit
both
germans
are
asleep
now
at
last
a
noise
in
the
corridor
a
tramp
on
the
stairs
only
walkers
no
there
a
stretcher
and
another
now
reflection
ends
my
feet
begin
to
move
my
hands
to
undo
bootlaces
flick
down
thermometers
wash
and
fetch
and
carry
the
gallants
play
bridge
without
looking
up
i
am
tremendously
fortified
against
them
for
one
moment
i
fiercely
condemn
and
then
forget
them
for
i
am
without
convictions
antipathies
prejudices
reflections
i
only
work
and
watch
watch
our
ward
is
divided
half
of
it
is
neat
and
white
and
orderly
the
other
half
has
khaki
tumbled
all
over
it
sam
brownes
boots
caps
mud
the
caked
mud
from
the
other
side
but
the
neat
beds
are
empty
the
occupants
out
talking
to
the
asking
questions
only
the
gallants
play
their
bridge
unmoved
they
are
on
their
mettle
showing
off
their
turn
will
come
some
day
now
it
only
remains
to
walk
home
hungry
under
a
heavy
moon
the
snow
is
running
down
the
gutters
what
a
strange
and
penetrating
smell
of
spring
february
can
it
be
yet
the
running
snow
is
uncovering
something
that
has
been
delayed
in
the
garden
a
blackbird
made
a
sudden
cry
in
the
hedge
i
did
smell
spring
and
i
starving
i
thought
last
night
that
a
hospital
ward
is
above
all
a
serene
place
in
spite
of
pain
and
blood
and
dressings
gravity
rules
it
and
order
and
a
quiet
procession
of
duties
last
night
i
made
beds
with
the
eldest
sister
the
eldest
sister
is
good
company
to
make
beds
with
she
is
quiet
unless
i
rouse
her
and
when
i
talk
she
smiles
with
her
eyes
i
like
to
walk
slowly
round
the
ward
stooping
and
rising
over
the
white
beds
flicking
the
sheets
mechanically
from
the
mattress
and
finally
turning
the
mattress
with
an
ease
which
gives
me
pleasure
because
i
am
strong
in
life
nothing
is
too
small
to
please
once
during
the
evening
the
eldest
sister
said
to
me
i
am
worried
about
your
throat
is
it
no
better
and
from
the
pang
of
pleasure
and
gratitude
that
went
through
me
i
have
learnt
the
value
of
such
remarks
in
every
bed
there
is
some
one
whose
throat
is
at
least
more
sore
than
mine
though
i
am
not
one
of
those
fierce
who
scoff
at
sore
throats
and
look
for
wounds
yet
i
did
know
it
was
so
easy
to
give
pleasure
the
strange
disarming
ways
of
men
and
women
i
stood
in
the
bunk
beside
the
youngest
sister
and
she
looked
up
suddenly
with
her
absent
stare
and
said
you
not
so
nice
as
you
used
to
be
i
was
dumbfounded
had
i
been
nice
and
now
different
what
a
maddening
sentence
for
i
felt
she
was
going
to
refuse
me
any
spoken
explanation
but
one
should
not
listen
to
what
people
say
only
to
what
they
mean
and
she
was
one
of
those
persons
whose
minds
one
must
read
for
oneself
since
her
words
so
often
deformed
her
thoughts
the
familiarity
and
equality
of
her
tone
seemed
to
come
from
some
mood
removed
from
the
hospital
where
her
mistrustful
mind
was
hovering
about
a
trouble
personal
to
herself
she
did
not
mean
you
are
not
so
nice
but
you
do
like
me
so
much
she
was
so
young
it
was
all
so
new
to
her
she
wanted
so
to
be
liked
but
there
was
this
question
of
her
authority
how
was
she
to
live
among
her
fellows
can
one
afford
to
disdain
them
can
one
steer
happily
with
indifference
must
one
to
be
liked
bend
one
spirit
to
theirs
and
most
disturbing
question
of
all
is
to
be
liked
the
final
standard
whether
to
wear
or
not
to
wear
a
mask
towards
one
world
for
there
is
so
much
that
is
not
ripe
to
show
change
and
uncertainty
as
she
sat
there
unfolding
to
me
the
fogs
of
her
situation
her
fresh
pink
face
clouded
her
grand
cap
and
red
cape
adding
burdens
of
authority
to
the
toil
of
growth
i
could
readily
have
looked
into
the
glass
to
see
if
my
hair
was
grey
then
there
is
nothing
you
condemn
said
the
youngest
sister
finally
at
the
close
of
a
conversation
i
have
come
up
against
the
bedrock
of
her
integrity
it
is
terrible
she
has
eternal
youth
eternal
fair
hair
cold
and
ignorant
judgments
on
things
relating
to
the
world
i
ca
further
soften
her
a
man
must
do
the
rest
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
i
am
so
tired
of
this
cry
for
a
gentleman
why
ca
they
do
very
well
with
what
they
got
here
in
the
wards
the
sisters
have
the
stuff
the
world
is
made
of
laid
out
bedded
before
their
eyes
the
ups
and
downs
of
man
from
the
four
corners
of
the
empire
and
the
hundred
corners
of
social
life
helpless
and
in
pyjamas
and
they
not
satisfied
but
must
cry
for
a
gentleman
i
could
make
a
friend
of
that
man
the
youngest
sister
loves
to
add
to
her
criticism
of
a
patient
it
is
my
part
as
a
to
cry
who
wants
you
to
i
could
trust
that
man
the
youngest
sister
will
say
equally
often
this
goes
deeper
but
whom
need
one
trust
brother
lover
friend
no
more
why
wish
to
trust
all
the
world
they
are
not
real
men
she
says
not
men
through
and
through
that
where
she
goes
wrong
they
are
men
through
and
through
patchy
ordinary
human
she
means
they
are
not
men
after
her
pattern
something
will
happen
in
the
ward
once
i
have
touched
this
bedrock
in
her
i
shall
be
for
ever
touching
it
till
it
gets
sore
one
should
seek
for
no
response
they
are
not
elastic
these
nuns
in
all
honesty
the
hospital
is
a
convent
and
the
men
in
it
my
brothers
this
for
months
on
end
for
all
that
now
and
then
some
one
raises
his
eyes
and
looks
at
me
one
day
follows
another
and
the
glance
deepens
charme
de
qui
pourrait
vous
peindre
women
are
left
behind
when
one
goes
into
hospital
such
women
as
are
in
a
hospital
should
be
cool
gentle
anything
else
becomes
a
torment
to
the
prisoner
for
me
too
it
is
bad
it
brings
the
world
back
into
my
eyes
duties
are
neglected
discomforts
unobserved
but
there
are
things
one
does
fight
charme
de
the
ward
is
changed
the
eldest
sister
and
the
youngest
sister
are
my
enemies
the
patients
are
my
enemies
even
wicks
who
lies
on
his
back
with
his
large
head
turned
fixedly
my
way
to
see
how
often
i
stop
at
the
bed
whose
number
is
last
night
he
dared
to
say
it
not
like
you
nurse
staying
so
much
with
that
rowdy
crew
the
gallants
i
know
but
one
among
them
has
grown
quieter
and
his
bed
is
no
even
wicks
is
my
enemy
he
watches
and
guards
who
knows
what
he
might
say
to
the
eldest
sister
he
has
nothing
to
do
all
day
but
watch
and
guard
in
the
bunk
at
tea
i
sit
among
thoughts
of
my
own
the
sisters
are
my
enemies
i
am
alive
delirious
but
not
happy
i
am
at
any
one
mercy
i
have
lost
thirty
friends
in
a
day
the
is
in
bed
no
this
is
bad
hospital
can
not
shelter
this
life
we
lead
no
and
i
he
is
a
prisoner
and
i
have
my
honour
my
responsibility
towards
him
he
has
come
into
this
room
to
be
cured
not
tormented
even
my
hand
must
not
meet
his
no
not
even
in
a
careless
touch
not
even
in
its
duty
or
if
it
does
what
risk
i
am
conspired
against
it
is
not
i
who
make
his
bed
hand
him
what
he
wishes
some
accident
defeats
me
every
time
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
it
seems
strange
that
the
sisters
should
be
my
enemies
do
we
deserve
sympathy
and
pity
no
and
i
from
women
too
is
there
a
charm
hanging
about
us
are
we
leading
magic
days
do
they
feel
it
and
dislike
it
why
i
feel
that
the
little
love
we
have
created
is
a
hare
whose
natural
fate
is
to
be
run
by
every
hound
but
i
do
see
the
reason
we
ca
speak
no
and
i
only
a
whispered
word
or
two
that
seems
to
shout
itself
into
every
ear
we
do
know
each
other
last
night
it
was
stronger
than
i
let
him
stand
near
me
and
talk
i
saw
the
youngest
sister
at
the
far
end
of
the
ward
by
the
door
but
i
did
move
she
was
watching
the
moment
i
took
my
eyes
from
her
i
forgot
her
that
is
how
one
feels
when
one
is
desperate
that
is
how
trouble
comes
later
i
stood
down
by
the
hatch
waiting
for
the
tray
of
fish
and
as
i
stood
there
the
youngest
sister
beside
me
he
came
down
for
he
was
up
and
dressed
yesterday
and
offered
to
carry
the
tray
for
he
is
reckless
too
she
told
him
to
go
back
and
said
to
me
looking
from
her
young
condemning
eyes
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
can
make
up
for
being
the
cause
of
all
the
lateness
sister
and
then
i
stopped
short
i
hated
her
were
we
late
i
looked
at
the
other
trays
we
were
not
late
it
was
untrue
she
had
said
that
because
she
had
had
to
wrap
her
barb
in
something
and
had
the
courage
to
reprove
me
officially
i
resented
that
and
her
air
of
equality
since
i
am
under
her
authority
and
agree
to
it
why
dare
she
not
use
it
as
for
me
i
dared
not
speak
to
her
all
the
evening
she
would
have
no
weapons
against
me
if
i
am
to
remember
she
is
my
sister
i
must
hold
my
hand
over
my
mouth
she
would
not
speak
to
me
either
that
was
wrong
of
her
she
is
in
authority
not
i
it
is
difficult
for
her
because
she
is
so
young
but
i
have
no
room
for
sympathy
at
moments
i
forget
her
position
and
burning
with
resentment
i
reflect
this
schoolgirl
i
walked
down
to
the
hospital
thinking
i
must
be
stronger
it
is
i
who
in
the
inverted
position
of
things
should
be
the
stronger
he
is
being
tortured
and
he
has
no
release
he
can
not
even
be
alone
a
moment
but
at
the
hospital
gates
i
thought
of
nothing
but
that
i
should
see
him
in
the
bunk
sat
the
eldest
sister
writing
in
a
book
it
passed
through
my
head
that
the
two
sisters
had
probably
sat
on
my
affairs
together
i
wondered
without
interest
what
the
other
had
told
her
putting
on
my
cap
i
walked
into
the
ward
surely
his
bed
had
had
a
pink
eiderdown
i
walked
up
the
ward
and
looked
at
it
but
i
knew
without
need
of
a
second
glance
what
had
happened
his
bed
was
made
in
the
fashion
in
which
we
make
an
empty
bed
a
bed
that
waits
for
a
new
patient
his
locker
was
empty
and
stood
open
already
scrubbed
i
smiled
as
i
noticed
they
had
even
left
me
that
to
do
no
one
volunteered
a
word
of
explanation
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
say
he
had
gone
these
women
i
smiled
again
only
the
comic
phrase
rang
in
my
head
they
properly
done
me
in
properly
done
me
in
i
went
downstairs
and
fetched
the
trays
and
all
the
time
the
smile
was
on
my
lips
these
women
somehow
i
had
the
better
of
the
sister
it
is
better
to
be
in
the
wrong
than
in
the
right
his
friends
looked
at
me
a
little
but
apparently
he
had
left
no
message
for
me
later
i
learnt
that
he
had
been
taken
to
another
hospital
at
two
while
i
came
on
at
three
once
during
the
evening
the
eldest
sister
mentioned
vaguely
has
gone
and
i
said
aloud
after
a
little
reflection
yes
in
the
nick
of
time
sister
during
the
evening
i
realized
that
i
should
never
see
him
again
it
was
here
in
this
ward
the
thing
had
grown
the
hare
we
had
started
bear
the
strain
of
any
other
life
he
might
write
but
i
should
go
and
see
him
he
must
be
wild
i
thought
with
pity
the
feeling
between
us
would
die
anyhow
better
throw
in
my
strength
with
the
sister
and
help
her
hurl
it
now
towards
its
death
i
looked
at
her
bent
head
with
a
secret
triumph
then
slowly
how
permanently
am
i
in
disgrace
and
she
not
at
all
now
behind
the
stone
pillar
of
the
gateway
is
one
dirty
little
patch
of
snow
i
saw
it
even
in
the
moonless
darkness
the
crown
of
the
hill
here
holds
the
last
snows
but
for
all
that
the
spring
smell
is
steaming
among
the
trees
and
up
and
down
the
bracken
slopes
in
the
garden
next
door
there
is
no
moon
there
are
no
stars
no
promise
to
the
eye
but
in
the
dense
vapouring
darkness
the
bulbs
are
moving
i
can
smell
what
is
not
earth
or
rain
or
bark
the
curtain
has
been
drawn
over
no
the
sister
holds
the
corners
tightly
against
the
he
is
outside
somewhere
in
the
world
and
i
am
here
moving
among
my
thirty
friends
and
since
it
is
spring
yet
the
lights
are
lit
to
hide
the
twilight
the
sister
eyes
talk
to
me
again
as
we
make
beds
yes
even
bed
no
with
a
little
jaundice
boy
in
it
they
let
me
make
it
now
last
night
we
had
another
concert
in
the
ward
a
concert
demoralizes
me
by
reason
of
sitting
on
the
beds
and
talking
to
whom
one
wills
i
regain
my
old
manners
and
forget
that
a
patient
may
be
washed
fed
dressed
but
not
talked
to
my
old
manners
were
more
gracious
but
less
docile
afterwards
we
wheeled
the
beds
back
into
their
positions
i
bumped
lambert
as
i
wheeled
it
and
apologized
i
not
grumbling
he
smiled
from
his
pillow
you
never
do
i
answered
you
do
know
me
nurse
and
i
thought
as
i
looked
down
at
him
i
shall
never
know
him
better
or
so
well
again
indeed
a
sister
is
a
curious
creature
she
is
like
a
fortress
unassailable
and
whose
sleeping
guns
may
fire
at
any
minute
i
was
struck
with
a
bit
of
knowledge
last
night
that
will
serve
me
through
life
that
to
justify
oneself
is
the
inexcusable
fault
it
is
better
to
be
in
the
wrong
than
in
the
right
a
sister
has
an
intimate
life
it
occurs
when
she
goes
off
duty
that
is
to
say
it
lies
between
when
she
finishes
her
supper
and
when
she
finishes
undressing
that
is
why
one
sister
said
to
me
if
i
had
taken
up
nursing
i
should
have
gone
in
for
culture
i
do
laugh
at
that
to
have
an
intimate
life
one
must
have
a
little
time
who
am
i
that
i
can
step
in
from
outside
to
criticize
the
hospital
is
not
my
life
i
am
expectant
but
for
them
here
and
now
is
the
business
of
life
as
the
weeks
go
by
i
recognize
the
difficulty
of
keeping
the
life
of
the
sisters
and
the
out
of
the
circle
of
my
thoughts
their
vigorous
and
symmetrical
vision
of
the
ward
attacks
me
their
attitude
towards
the
patients
which
began
by
offending
me
ends
by
overtaking
me
on
the
whole
the
sisters
loathe
relations
they
look
into
the
ward
and
see
the
mothers
and
sisters
and
wives
camped
round
the
beds
and
go
back
into
the
bunk
feeling
that
the
ward
does
belong
to
them
the
eldest
sister
said
to
me
yesterday
shut
the
door
nurse
captain
fellows
father
i
do
want
him
fussing
round
on
that
we
discussed
relations
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
inevitable
that
a
sister
should
be
the
only
buffer
between
them
and
their
pressing
anxieties
no
a
relation
is
the
last
straw
you
do
understand
she
said
i
do
understand
but
i
am
not
specialized
long
ago
in
the
mess
i
said
to
sister
laughing
i
would
go
through
the
four
years
training
just
to
wear
that
cap
and
cape
and
she
you
could
go
through
it
and
come
out
as
you
are
wicks
has
set
his
heart
on
crutches
if
you
wo
try
me
on
them
i
buy
me
own
and
walk
out
of
here
then
i
realize
the
vanity
of
his
threat
and
the
completeness
of
his
imprisonment
and
hurry
to
suggest
a
new
idea
before
he
sees
it
too
we
set
him
on
crutches
he
is
brave
he
said
with
anger
i
ca
stand
on
these
they
too
long
you
go
and
ask
for
some
shorter
ones
and
thus
together
we
slurred
over
the
fact
of
that
pendulous
nerveless
body
which
had
hung
from
the
crutches
like
an
old
stocking
but
all
the
evening
he
was
buried
in
his
own
silence
and
i
suppose
he
was
looking
at
the
vision
on
the
bedrail
a
boy
of
seventeen
was
brought
in
yesterday
with
pneumonia
he
was
so
ill
that
he
could
speak
and
we
put
screens
round
his
bed
all
the
other
patients
in
the
ward
immediately
became
convalescents
i
helped
sister
to
wash
him
holding
him
on
his
side
while
he
groaned
with
pain
and
sister
no
longer
cynical
said
there
you
are
sonnie
it
almost
finished
when
i
rolled
back
the
blanket
it
gave
me
a
shock
to
see
how
young
his
feet
were
clean
and
thin
with
the
big
toe
curling
up
and
the
little
toes
curling
back
will
you
brush
my
hair
he
managed
to
say
to
me
and
when
i
had
finished
this
is
a
pretty
ward
it
is
but
i
am
glad
it
seems
so
to
him
the
boy
is
at
his
worst
whenever
we
come
near
him
he
lifts
his
eyes
and
asks
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
but
to
whatever
we
do
he
submits
with
a
terrible
docility
lying
there
propped
on
his
pillow
with
his
small
yellow
face
staring
down
the
ward
he
is
all
the
centre
of
my
thoughts
i
am
preoccupied
with
the
mystery
that
is
in
his
lungs
five
days
ago
he
was
walking
on
his
legs
five
days
and
he
is
on
the
edge
of
the
world
looking
over
the
edge
there
is
no
shell
no
mark
no
tear
the
attack
comes
from
within
the
others
in
the
ward
are
like
phantoms
when
i
say
how
is
the
boy
what
will
they
say
the
sun
on
the
cobwebs
lights
them
as
it
lights
the
above
the
cocks
scream
from
every
garden
the
sky
is
like
a
pale
and
aeroplanes
from
the
two
aerodromes
are
droning
round
the
hill
i
think
from
time
to
time
is
he
alive
can
one
grow
used
to
death
it
is
unsafe
to
think
of
this
for
if
death
becomes
cheap
it
is
the
watcher
not
the
dying
who
is
poisoned
his
mother
buys
a
cake
every
day
and
brings
it
at
saying
for
the
sisters
tea
it
is
a
bribe
dumbly
offered
more
to
be
on
the
safe
side
of
every
bit
of
chance
than
because
she
really
believes
it
can
make
the
slightest
difference
now
that
i
have
time
to
think
of
it
her
little
action
hurts
me
but
yesterday
i
helped
to
eat
it
with
pleasure
because
one
is
hungry
and
the
margarine
not
the
best
aches
and
pains
pains
and
aches
i
do
know
how
to
get
home
up
the
long
hill
measles
unposted
dear
sister
four
more
days
before
they
will
let
me
out
of
bed
whatever
i
promise
to
a
patient
in
future
i
shall
do
if
i
have
to
wear
a
notebook
hanging
on
my
belt
by
which
you
will
see
that
i
am
making
discoveries
the
quality
of
in
a
person
lying
horizontally
is
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
one
is
always
expecting
something
generally
it
is
food
three
times
a
day
it
is
the
post
oftener
it
is
the
performance
of
some
promise
the
things
that
one
asks
from
one
bed
are
so
small
you
get
me
a
book
you
move
that
vase
of
flowers
you
come
up
next
time
could
you
bring
me
an
envelope
but
if
one
can
not
get
them
life
might
as
well
stop
the
wonder
to
me
is
how
they
stood
me
i
was
always
cheerful
i
thought
it
a
merit
i
find
instead
it
is
an
exasperation
i
make
a
hundred
reflections
since
my
eyes
are
too
bad
to
read
i
stare
at
the
ceiling
and
if
a
moth
comes
on
it
and
just
now
that
happened
or
i
would
not
have
thought
of
mentioning
it
i
watch
the
pair
of
them
the
moth
and
its
leaping
shadow
as
they
whirl
from
square
to
square
of
the
ceiling
this
keeps
my
thoughts
quiet
then
in
the
daytime
there
is
the
garden
the
dog
that
crosses
the
lawn
the
gardener
talking
to
himself
the
girl
who
goes
to
feed
the
hens
i
do
say
that
in
any
of
these
things
i
find
a
substitute
for
reading
but
since
i
ca
and
may
read
i
am
thinking
you
know
of
the
beds
down
the
side
of
the
ward
there
wicks
now
he
has
his
back
to
the
road
with
the
trams
on
it
do
you
see
anything
in
that
i
do
but
then
i
have
the
advantage
of
you
my
position
is
horizontal
wicks
position
is
also
strictly
horizontal
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
could
see
those
trams
mark
saturdays
and
sundays
by
the
increase
of
passengers
make
little
games
to
himself
involving
the
number
of
persons
to
get
on
and
off
for
the
is
within
view
i
know
for
i
looked
it
might
be
possible
to
draw
him
back
from
that
apathy
which
i
too
as
well
as
you
was
ceasing
to
notice
wicks
sister
not
only
has
his
back
to
the
road
with
trams
on
it
but
for
eleven
months
he
has
had
his
eyes
on
the
yellow
stone
of
the
wall
of
the
german
ward
that
is
when
they
are
not
on
his
own
bedrail
but
if
his
bed
were
turned
round
to
range
alongside
the
window
for
he
is
a
man
with
two
eyes
not
one
who
can
write
upon
a
stone
wall
with
his
thoughts
and
yet
it
would
be
impossible
there
not
a
ward
in
the
hospital
whose
symmetry
is
so
spoilt
and
that
you
know
is
a
difficulty
for
you
to
weigh
how
far
are
you
a
dictator
i
have
been
thinking
of
my
r√¥le
and
yours
in
the
long
run
however
i
become
my
soul
should
be
given
to
the
smoothing
of
pillows
you
are
barred
from
so
many
kinds
of
sympathy
you
must
not
sympathize
over
the
deficiencies
of
the
hospital
over
the
food
over
the
lack
of
imagination
over
the
intolerable
habits
of
the
man
in
the
next
bed
you
must
not
sigh
know
to
any
of
these
plaints
yours
is
the
running
of
the
ward
yours
the
isolation
of
a
crowned
head
one
day
you
said
a
penetrating
thing
to
me
not
very
ill
but
he
feeling
wretched
run
along
and
do
the
sympathetic
touch
for
a
moment
i
just
able
to
do
a
poultice
or
a
fomentation
resented
it
but
you
were
right
one
has
one
iii
the
boys
so
now
one
steps
down
from
chintz
covers
and
lemonade
to
the
main
army
and
and
to
show
how
little
one
has
one
eye
upon
the
larger
issues
the
thing
that
upset
me
most
on
coming
into
a
tommies
ward
was
the
fact
that
instead
of
lemons
twice
a
day
for
the
making
of
lemonade
i
now
squeeze
two
into
an
old
jug
and
hope
for
the
best
about
the
sugar
smiff
said
give
us
a
drop
of
lemon
nurse
and
the
sister
go
on
with
you
i
wo
have
the
new
nurse
making
a
pet
of
you
i
suppose
i
new
to
it
and
one
ca
carry
on
the
work
that
way
but
god
knows
the
water
one
can
add
to
a
lemon
is
cheap
enough
smiff
had
a
flash
of
temper
he
said
keepin
me
here
at
green
walls
this
way
nothing
but
green
nine
blessed
months
his
foot
is
off
and
for
the
first
time
the
doctor
had
promised
that
he
should
be
wheeled
into
the
corridor
but
it
was
forgotten
and
i
am
too
new
to
jog
the
memory
of
the
gods
it
a
queer
place
a
tommies
ward
it
makes
me
nervous
i
not
simple
enough
they
make
me
shy
i
ca
think
of
them
like
the
others
do
as
the
boys
they
seem
to
me
men
i
suffer
awfully
from
my
language
in
this
ward
i
seem
to
be
the
only
of
whom
they
continually
ask
what
say
nurse
it
is
that
i
use
long
words
but
my
sentences
seem
to
be
inverted
an
opportunity
for
learning
to
speak
simple
saxon
an
antitetanic
injection
for
corrigan
said
sister
and
i
went
to
the
dispensary
to
fetch
the
syringe
and
the
needles
but
has
he
any
symptoms
i
asked
in
a
tommies
ward
one
dare
ask
anything
there
is
that
mystery
which
used
to
surround
the
illnesses
oh
no
she
said
it
just
that
he
has
had
his
full
amount
in
france
so
i
hunted
up
the
and
we
prepared
it
talking
of
it
but
we
forgot
to
talk
of
it
to
corrigan
the
needle
was
into
his
shoulder
before
he
knew
why
his
shirt
was
held
up
his
wrath
came
like
an
avalanche
the
discipline
of
two
years
was
forgotten
his
irish
tongue
was
loosened
sister
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
laughed
i
listened
to
him
as
i
cleaned
the
syringe
i
gathered
that
it
was
the
indignity
that
had
shocked
his
sense
of
individual
pride
treating
me
like
a
cow
i
heard
him
say
to
smiff
who
laughed
since
it
was
his
shoulder
that
carried
the
serum
smiff
laughed
he
has
been
in
hospital
nine
months
and
his
theory
is
that
a
sister
may
do
anything
at
any
moment
his
theory
is
that
nothing
does
any
good
that
if
you
do
fuss
you
do
get
worse
corrigan
was
angry
all
day
the
idea
that
a
bloomin
woman
should
come
an
shove
something
into
me
systim
was
too
much
for
him
but
he
forgets
himself
there
are
no
individualists
now
his
system
belongs
to
us
sister
said
laughing
to
smiff
the
other
day
your
leg
is
mine
wrong
again
it
the
governmint
said
smiff
but
corrigan
is
irish
and
does
like
that
joke
there
are
times
when
my
heart
fails
me
when
my
eyes
my
ears
my
tongue
and
my
understanding
fail
me
when
pain
means
nothing
to
me
in
the
bus
yesterday
i
came
down
from
london
sitting
beside
a
sister
from
another
ward
who
held
her
hand
to
her
ear
and
shifted
in
her
seat
she
told
me
she
had
earache
and
i
felt
sorry
for
her
as
she
had
earache
we
did
talk
and
i
sat
huddled
in
my
corner
and
watched
the
names
of
the
shops
thinking
as
i
was
more
or
less
forced
to
do
by
her
movements
of
her
earache
what
struck
me
was
her
own
angry
bewilderment
before
the
fact
of
her
pain
but
it
hurts
you
no
idea
how
it
hurts
she
was
surprised
many
times
a
day
she
hears
the
words
sister
you
hurtin
me
could
you
shift
my
heel
it
like
a
toothache
and
similar
sentences
i
hear
them
in
our
ward
all
the
time
one
ca
pass
down
the
ward
without
some
such
request
falling
on
one
ears
she
is
astonished
at
her
earache
she
is
astonished
at
what
pain
can
be
it
is
unexpected
she
is
ready
to
be
angry
with
herself
with
her
pain
with
her
ear
it
is
monstrous
she
thinks
the
pain
of
one
creature
can
not
continue
to
have
a
meaning
for
another
it
is
almost
impossible
to
nurse
a
man
well
whose
pain
you
do
not
imagine
a
deadlock
one
has
illuminations
all
the
time
there
is
an
old
lady
who
visits
in
our
ward
at
whom
for
one
or
two
unimportant
reasons
it
is
the
custom
to
laugh
the
men
who
fall
in
with
our
moods
with
a
docility
which
i
am
beginning
to
suspect
is
a
mask
admit
too
that
she
is
comic
this
afternoon
when
she
was
sitting
by
corrigan
bed
and
talking
to
him
i
saw
where
her
treatment
of
him
differed
from
ours
she
treats
him
as
though
he
were
an
individual
but
there
is
more
in
it
than
that
she
treats
him
as
though
he
had
a
wife
and
children
a
house
and
a
back
garden
and
responsibilities
in
some
manner
she
treats
him
as
though
he
had
dignity
i
thought
of
yesterday
injection
that
is
the
difference
that
is
what
the
sisters
mean
when
they
say
the
the
story
of
rees
is
not
yet
ended
in
either
of
the
two
ways
in
which
stories
end
in
a
hospital
his
arm
does
not
get
worse
but
his
courage
is
ebbing
this
morning
i
wheeled
him
out
to
the
awful
sleep
again
for
the
third
time
they
will
take
nearly
anything
from
each
other
the
only
thing
that
cheered
rees
up
as
he
was
wheeled
away
was
the
voice
of
pinker
crying
jer
want
white
flowers
on
yer
coffin
we
see
to
the
brass
from
pinker
a
little
boy
from
the
mile
end
road
they
will
stand
anything
he
is
the
servant
of
the
ward
he
says
partly
through
his
good
nature
and
a
little
because
he
has
two
good
arms
and
legs
i
no
skivvy
he
protests
all
the
time
but
every
little
odd
job
gets
done
rees
when
he
wakes
wakes
sobbing
and
says
don
go
away
nurse
he
holds
my
hand
in
a
fierce
clutch
then
releases
it
to
point
in
the
air
crying
there
the
pain
as
though
the
pain
filled
the
air
and
rose
to
the
rafters
as
he
wakes
it
centralizes
until
at
last
comes
the
moment
when
he
says
me
arm
aches
cruel
and
points
to
it
then
one
can
leave
him
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
a
man
sing
at
his
dressing
i
was
standing
at
the
sterilizer
when
rees
song
began
to
mount
over
the
screen
that
hid
him
from
me
whatever
is
that
rees
tubes
going
in
it
was
like
this
ah
ee
oo
sister
and
again
sister
oo
ee
ah
then
a
little
scream
and
his
song
again
i
heard
her
voice
now
then
rees
i
do
call
that
much
of
a
song
she
called
me
to
make
his
bed
and
i
saw
his
left
ear
was
full
of
tears
o
visitors
who
come
into
the
ward
in
the
calm
of
the
long
afternoon
when
the
beds
are
neat
and
clean
and
the
flowers
out
on
the
tables
and
the
sit
sewing
at
splints
and
sandbags
when
the
men
look
like
men
again
and
smoke
and
talk
and
read
if
you
could
see
what
lies
beneath
the
dressings
when
one
shoots
at
a
wooden
figure
it
makes
a
hole
when
one
shoots
at
a
man
it
makes
a
hole
and
the
doctor
must
make
seven
others
i
heard
a
blackbird
sing
in
the
middle
of
the
night
last
night
two
bars
and
then
another
i
thought
at
first
it
might
be
a
burglar
whistling
to
his
mate
in
the
black
and
rustling
garden
but
it
was
a
blackbird
in
a
nightmare
those
distant
guns
again
now
a
lull
and
now
a
bombardment
again
a
lull
and
then
batter
batter
and
the
windows
tremble
is
the
lull
when
go
over
the
top
i
can
only
think
of
death
i
tried
to
think
just
now
what
is
it
after
all
death
comes
anyway
this
only
hastens
it
but
that
do
no
philosophy
helps
the
pain
of
death
it
is
pity
pity
pity
that
i
feel
and
sometimes
a
sort
of
shame
that
i
am
here
to
write
at
all
summer
can
it
be
summer
through
whose
hot
air
the
guns
shake
and
tremble
the
honeysuckle
whose
little
stalks
twinkled
and
shone
that
january
night
has
broken
at
each
woody
end
into
its
crumbled
flower
where
is
the
frost
the
snow
where
are
the
dead
where
is
my
trouble
and
my
longing
and
the
other
troubles
and
the
happiness
in
other
summers
alas
the
long
history
of
life
there
is
that
in
death
that
makes
the
throat
contract
and
the
heart
catch
everything
is
written
in
water
we
talk
of
tablets
to
the
dead
there
can
be
none
but
in
the
heart
and
the
heart
fades
there
are
only
ten
men
left
in
bed
in
the
ward
sometimes
i
think
will
there
never
be
another
convoy
and
then
is
not
one
man
alone
sufficient
matter
on
which
to
reflect
one
can
find
god
in
a
herring
head
says
a
japanese
proverb
when
there
is
not
much
to
do
in
the
ward
and
no
sound
comes
from
behind
the
screens
when
there
has
not
been
a
convoy
for
weeks
when
the
little
rubber
tubes
lie
in
the
and
the
syringe
gives
place
to
the
dry
dressing
then
they
set
one
of
us
aside
from
the
work
of
the
ward
to
sit
at
a
table
and
pad
splints
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
job
we
care
for
and
i
am
keeping
up
the
delusion
but
all
the
time
i
run
my
seams
straight
pull
the
horsehair
out
to
the
last
fine
shred
turn
in
my
corners
as
the
corners
of
a
leather
book
are
turned
so
that
i
may
be
kept
at
it
although
out
of
cunning
i
appear
to
grumble
and
long
to
be
released
one
does
not
wash
up
when
one
makes
splints
one
does
not
change
the
forcing
the
resentful
pillow
down
down
till
the
corners
of
the
case
are
filled
nor
walk
the
ward
in
search
of
odd
jobs
but
these
are
not
the
reasons
just
as
i
liked
the
unending
laying
of
the
trays
in
the
corridor
so
making
splints
appears
to
me
a
gentle
work
in
which
one
has
time
to
look
at
and
listen
to
the
ward
with
more
penetrating
eyes
with
wider
ears
a
work
varied
by
long
conversations
with
pinker
about
his
girl
and
the
trade
but
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
if
she
were
pretty
at
first
he
did
answer
and
appeared
to
be
thinking
very
seriously
of
a
way
out
perhaps
does
fer
me
all
right
he
presently
said
the
defence
of
his
girl
occupied
his
attention
for
after
a
few
minutes
he
returned
to
it
sensible
sort
of
girl
she
ai
soft
can
cook
all
that
i
went
on
sewing
my
splint
almost
reluctantly
he
pursued
got
photograph
but
he
did
not
get
up
at
once
and
we
turned
to
the
any
nib
he
said
crossed
ever
so
could
mend
it
kep
the
books
too
we
was
always
stocktaking
now
i
think
of
it
shops
always
stocktaking
they
do
it
all
down
the
strand
with
big
red
labels
across
the
front
he
rose
suddenly
and
crossed
to
his
locker
to
look
for
her
photograph
returning
after
a
few
minutes
with
a
bundle
of
little
cardboards
the
first
i
turned
over
was
that
of
a
pretty
girl
is
that
her
i
asked
she
pretty
that
young
sister
he
answered
i
turned
over
the
rest
and
he
pointed
out
his
family
one
by
one
last
of
all
his
girl
there
are
some
men
who
are
not
taken
in
by
a
bit
of
fair
hair
one
knows
what
these
cheap
photographs
are
how
they
distort
and
blacken
the
girl
who
looked
at
me
from
this
one
appeared
to
be
a
monster
she
had
an
enormous
face
enormous
spectacles
bands
of
galvanized
iron
drawn
across
her
forehead
for
hair
ther
just
them
two
an
sister
sister
ai
got
a
feller
yet
i
praised
his
girl
to
pinker
and
praised
pinker
to
myself
a
girl
friend
he
said
keeps
yer
straighter
than
a
man
makes
yer
punctual
so
she
wo
wait
for
you
when
you
are
late
not
a
minute
over
time
he
said
with
pride
i
used
to
be
a
terror
when
i
first
knew
kep
waitin
abaht
she
soon
cured
me
did
f
steel
you
are
a
funny
little
bird
pinker
said
the
sister
passing
lil
bird
am
i
he
tucked
his
cardboards
carefully
into
his
locker
and
followed
her
up
the
ward
firing
repartee
i
sewed
my
splint
in
all
walks
of
life
men
keep
one
waiting
i
should
like
to
ask
the
huge
and
terrible
girl
about
her
cure
monk
is
the
ugliest
man
i
have
ever
seen
he
has
a
squint
and
a
leer
his
mouth
drops
at
both
sides
he
has
no
forehead
and
his
straight
combed
hair
meets
his
eyebrows
or
rather
his
left
eyebrow
since
that
one
is
raised
by
a
cut
he
has
the
expression
of
a
and
yet
he
is
quite
young
and
shy
when
monk
was
working
at
a
woollen
belt
pinker
said
workin
that
for
yer
girl
you
got
a
girl
monk
monk
squinted
sidelong
at
pinker
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
like
a
large
ape
ai
got
no
girl
shrilled
pinker
monk
ai
got
no
girl
you
don
know
what
a
girl
is
do
yer
monk
although
they
do
much
more
to
help
each
other
than
i
ever
saw
done
in
the
officers
ward
yet
one
is
always
saying
things
that
i
find
myself
praying
the
other
has
heard
in
the
next
bed
to
monk
lies
gayner
six
foot
two
of
the
expeditionary
force
wounded
at
mons
he
was
brought
home
to
england
and
since
then
he
has
made
the
round
of
the
hospitals
he
is
a
sullen
man
who
will
not
read
or
write
or
sew
who
will
not
play
draughts
or
cards
or
speak
to
his
neighbour
he
sits
up
attentive
while
the
ulcers
on
his
leg
are
being
dressed
but
if
one
asks
him
something
of
the
history
of
his
wound
his
tone
holds
such
a
volume
of
bitterness
and
exasperation
that
one
feels
that
at
any
moment
the
locks
of
his
spirit
might
cease
to
ever
since
mons
these
ulcers
on
and
off
yes
oh
well
we
must
cure
them
now
her
light
tone
is
what
he
can
not
endure
he
does
not
believe
in
cure
and
will
not
believe
in
cure
it
has
become
an
article
of
faith
his
ulcers
will
never
be
cured
he
has
a
silent
scorn
of
hospitals
he
can
wind
a
perfect
bandage
and
he
knows
the
rules
beyond
that
he
pays
as
little
attention
as
possible
to
what
goes
on
when
his
dressing
is
over
he
tilts
his
thin
intelligent
face
at
the
ceiling
do
you
ever
read
i
asked
him
i
have
the
patience
he
replied
but
he
has
the
patience
to
lie
like
that
with
his
thin
lips
compressed
and
a
frown
on
his
face
for
hours
for
days
since
mons
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
has
a
violent
soul
that
he
dare
not
talk
it
is
no
life
for
a
man
i
said
to
pinker
this
morning
i
wish
you
hurry
up
over
your
bath
i
got
to
get
it
scrubbed
out
by
nine
do
you
hurry
me
nurse
said
pinker
it
the
time
i
can
think
in
me
bath
i
should
like
to
have
parried
with
pinker
only
my
language
is
so
much
more
complicated
than
it
ought
to
be
that
thinking
in
one
bath
is
a
i
lay
in
my
own
bath
last
night
and
thought
very
deep
thoughts
but
often
when
we
think
our
thoughts
are
deep
they
are
only
vague
bath
thoughts
are
wonderful
but
there
nothing
to
them
we
had
a
heated
discussion
as
to
whether
the
old
lady
who
leaves
a
tract
beneath
a
single
rose
by
each
bedside
could
longer
be
tolerated
she
is
a
nuisance
said
the
sister
the
men
make
more
noise
afterwards
because
they
set
her
hymns
to
ragtime
what
good
does
it
do
them
said
the
and
i
have
to
put
the
roses
in
water
i
rode
the
highest
horse
of
all
her
inquiries
about
their
souls
are
an
impertinence
why
should
they
be
bothered
these
are
the
sort
of
things
they
say
in
debating
societies
but
life
talks
differently
pinker
said
makes
the
ole
lady
as
one
bends
one
head
low
over
the
splint
one
sits
unnoticed
a
part
of
the
furniture
of
the
ward
the
sounds
of
the
ward
rise
and
fill
the
ears
it
is
like
listening
to
a
kettle
humming
bees
round
a
bush
of
flowers
the
ticking
of
a
clock
the
passing
of
life
now
and
then
there
are
incidents
as
just
now
two
orderlies
came
in
with
a
stretcher
to
fetch
smith
an
older
man
than
smiff
and
a
more
dignified
away
to
a
convalescent
home
smith
has
never
been
to
france
but
walked
into
our
ward
one
day
with
a
sore
on
his
foot
which
had
to
be
cut
he
was
up
and
dressed
in
his
bedraggled
khaki
uniform
when
the
came
for
him
he
looked
down
his
nose
at
the
stretcher
i
do
much
like
the
look
of
that
he
said
the
waited
for
him
he
stood
irresolute
i
never
bin
in
one
of
them
and
i
do
want
to
make
a
start
its
bad
luck
to
be
our
name
called
out
smiff
waving
his
amputated
ankle
better
get
your
hand
in
smith
got
in
slowly
and
departed
from
the
ward
sitting
bolt
upright
gripping
the
sides
with
his
hands
some
of
the
wards
and
the
sisters
bunks
are
charming
at
this
time
of
the
year
now
that
larkspur
and
are
cheap
in
the
market
but
the
love
of
decoration
is
not
woman
alone
through
the
dispensary
hatchway
i
saw
three
empty
each
with
a
poppy
stuck
in
its
neck
everything
in
the
dispensary
is
beautiful
its
glasses
its
flames
its
brass
weights
its
jars
and
globes
but
much
more
beautiful
because
it
is
half
a
floor
higher
than
the
corridor
in
which
we
stand
and
look
up
into
it
through
a
hatchway
in
the
wall
there
is
something
in
that
one
feels
like
gulliver
no
woman
has
ever
been
into
this
bachelors
temple
on
tapping
at
a
small
square
panel
set
in
the
wall
of
the
corridor
the
panel
flies
up
and
a
bachelor
is
seen
from
the
waist
to
the
knees
if
he
feels
well
and
my
smile
is
humble
he
will
stoop
and
i
see
looking
down
at
me
a
small
worn
face
and
bushy
eyebrows
or
a
long
ascetic
face
and
bleached
hair
or
a
beard
and
a
pair
of
bearded
nostrils
between
them
the
three
old
things
priests
in
their
way
measure
and
weigh
and
mix
and
scold
and
let
up
the
panel
and
bang
it
down
through
the
long
day
filling
the
hospital
with
their
coloured
bottles
sealed
packets
of
pills
jars
and
vaccines
and
precious
syringes
in
boxes
marked
to
be
returned
at
once
i
never
knew
a
sister
fail
to
toss
her
head
when
she
saw
this
message
it
is
a
very
social
spot
outside
the
panel
of
the
dispensary
each
goes
there
each
morning
as
one
might
do
one
marketing
and
meeting
there
puts
down
her
straw
basket
taps
at
the
panel
and
listens
to
the
scolding
of
the
old
men
with
only
half
an
ear
for
the
bachelors
amuse
themselves
when
they
are
not
mixing
and
weighing
by
inventing
odd
rules
and
codes
of
their
own
and
reaching
a
skinny
arm
through
the
hatchway
they
pin
them
on
little
scraps
of
paper
which
fall
down
and
are
swept
to
heaven
in
the
charwomen
pails
and
the
who
are
not
at
all
afraid
because
one
can
not
be
afraid
of
a
man
of
whom
one
has
never
seen
more
than
half
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
slips
and
a
deaf
ear
to
the
voices
bringing
their
bottles
and
their
jars
just
in
the
manner
they
were
taught
to
do
when
first
they
entered
the
hospital
and
they
gossip
they
have
just
seen
the
morning
papers
on
all
the
beds
they
have
just
heard
about
the
for
the
week
they
have
collected
little
rags
and
ends
of
news
as
they
came
along
the
corridor
they
gossip
and
once
a
bearded
bachelor
thumped
the
panel
down
almost
on
my
finger
leaving
three
startled
faces
staring
at
a
piece
of
painted
wood
but
a
little
dark
girl
worked
the
panel
up
an
inch
with
her
nails
and
cajoled
through
the
crack
i
have
said
before
that
the
long
corridor
is
wonderful
in
the
winter
afternoons
and
evenings
when
the
mist
rolled
up
and
down
over
the
tiles
like
the
smoke
in
a
tunnel
when
one
walked
almost
in
darkness
and
peered
into
the
then
forbidden
wards
when
dwarfs
coming
from
the
g
block
grew
larger
and
larger
till
the
a
block
turned
them
into
beings
of
one
own
size
the
corridor
always
made
a
special
impression
on
me
but
in
the
summer
mornings
it
is
remarkable
too
then
regiments
of
charwomen
occupy
it
working
in
close
mass
formation
seven
will
work
abreast
upon
their
knees
flanked
by
their
pails
their
hands
moving
backwards
and
forwards
in
so
complicated
a
system
that
there
appears
to
be
no
system
at
all
patches
of
the
corridor
are
thick
with
soapsuds
patches
are
dry
the
art
of
walking
the
corridor
in
the
morning
can
be
learnt
and
for
a
year
and
five
months
i
have
done
it
with
no
more
than
a
slip
and
a
slide
but
yesterday
i
stepped
on
a
charwoman
hand
it
was
worse
than
stepping
on
a
puppy
one
knows
that
sickening
lift
of
the
heart
as
though
the
will
could
undo
the
weight
of
the
foot
the
stagger
the
sense
of
one
unpardonable
heaviness
i
slipped
on
her
hand
as
on
a
piece
of
and
jumping
like
a
chamois
sent
the
next
pail
all
over
the
heels
of
the
front
rank
it
was
the
sort
of
situation
with
which
one
can
do
nothing
i
met
a
friend
yesterday
one
of
the
old
chelsea
people
he
has
followed
his
natural
development
although
he
talks
war
war
war
it
is
from
his
old
angle
it
wears
the
old
he
belongs
to
a
movement
which
believes
it
feels
the
war
personal
injury
or
personal
loss
does
not
enter
the
question
the
heart
of
this
movement
of
his
bleeds
perpetually
but
impersonally
he
claims
for
it
that
this
heart
is
able
to
bleed
more
profusely
than
any
other
heart
individual
or
collective
in
let
us
limit
it
to
england
in
fact
it
is
the
only
blood
he
has
noticed
when
the
taxes
go
up
he
says
well
now
perhaps
it
will
make
people
feel
the
war
for
he
longs
that
every
one
should
lose
their
money
so
that
at
last
they
may
feel
the
war
stop
the
war
interchangeable
he
forgets
that
even
in
england
a
great
many
quite
stupid
people
would
rather
lose
their
money
than
their
sons
how
strange
that
these
people
should
still
picture
the
minds
of
soldiers
as
filled
with
the
glitter
of
bright
bayonets
and
the
glory
of
war
they
think
we
need
a
vision
of
blood
and
ravage
and
death
to
turn
us
from
our
bright
thoughts
to
still
the
noise
of
the
drum
in
our
ears
the
drums
do
beat
the
flags
do
fly
he
should
come
down
the
side
of
the
ward
and
hear
what
the
dairyman
says
i
it
nurse
i
it
them
kill
me
them
drills
it
no
life
for
a
man
nurse
the
dairyman
has
been
to
the
front
you
need
go
to
the
front
to
hate
the
war
sometimes
i
get
a
glimpse
from
him
of
what
it
means
to
the
weaklings
the
feeble
creatures
me
that
queer
nurse
it
seems
to
get
queerer
every
day
i
worryin
i
keep
thinkin
of
them
always
the
horses
i
said
to
sister
is
no
really
ill
there
a
chance
of
his
being
mental
she
said
he
is
being
watched
was
he
mental
before
the
war
took
him
before
the
sergeant
used
to
whip
the
horses
as
they
got
to
the
jumps
before
the
sergeant
cried
out
cross
your
stirrups
it
is
his
fault
there
are
strong
and
feeble
men
a
dairyman
is
a
gentle
job
he
could
have
scraped
through
life
all
right
he
sleeps
in
the
afternoon
and
stirs
and
murmurs
drop
your
reins
them
sergeant
i
comin
sergeant
do
touch
this
time
and
then
in
a
shriller
voice
do
touch
then
he
wakes
poor
mass
of
nerves
he
nods
and
smiles
every
time
one
looks
at
him
frantic
to
please
there
are
men
and
men
scutts
has
eleven
wounds
but
he
does
mind
the
war
god
made
many
brands
of
men
that
is
all
one
must
accept
them
but
war
finds
few
excuses
and
there
are
strange
minnows
in
the
sometimes
looking
into
the
ward
i
think
it
almost
comes
to
this
one
must
spit
blood
or
fight
why
do
you
refuse
my
friend
would
say
to
the
dairyman
why
should
you
fight
because
another
man
tells
you
to
it
is
so
simple
as
that
is
it
dairyman
it
is
even
a
question
of
the
immense
vague
machinery
behind
the
sergeant
but
just
the
sergeant
himself
it
is
a
question
of
generals
or
politicians
of
great
wrongs
or
fierce
beliefs
but
of
the
bugle
which
calls
you
in
the
morning
and
the
bugle
which
puts
you
to
bed
at
night
well
well
the
dairyman
is
in
hospital
and
that
is
the
best
that
he
can
hope
for
i
read
a
book
once
about
a
prison
they
too
the
prisoners
sought
after
the
prison
hospital
as
one
seeks
after
one
heaven
it
is
so
puffed
up
of
my
friend
to
think
that
his
and
his
movement
are
the
only
eyes
to
see
the
vision
of
horror
why
these
others
the
vision
this
afternoon
i
was
put
at
splints
again
i
only
had
an
inch
or
two
to
finish
and
i
spun
it
out
very
happy
presently
the
foot
of
a
bed
near
me
began
to
catch
my
attention
the
toe
beneath
the
sheets
became
more
and
more
agitated
then
the
toes
of
the
other
foot
joined
the
first
foot
beating
a
frenzied
tattoo
beneath
the
coverings
i
looked
up
facing
me
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
were
bulging
above
an
open
mouth
the
nostrils
were
quivering
the
fingers
were
wrung
together
it
was
gayner
surely
seeing
a
ghost
i
rose
and
went
to
his
bed
my
jaws
want
to
close
he
muttered
i
ca
keep
them
open
i
jumped
and
went
for
sister
who
took
the
news
in
a
leisurely
fashion
which
reproved
me
for
my
excitement
feeling
a
fool
i
went
and
sat
down
again
taking
up
my
splint
but
there
was
no
forgetting
gayner
i
tried
to
keep
my
eyes
on
my
work
but
first
his
toes
and
then
his
hands
filled
all
my
mind
till
at
last
i
had
to
look
up
and
meet
the
eyes
again
still
looking
as
though
he
had
seen
a
ghost
a
beast
of
a
ghost
in
hospital
since
mons
i
wonder
how
many
men
he
has
seen
die
of
tetanus
i
thought
he
got
the
jumps
i
thought
so
had
i
suppose
sister
was
wrong
suppose
the
precious
minutes
were
passing
suppose
she
was
only
the
junior
sister
shall
i
get
you
some
water
i
said
at
last
he
nodded
and
gulped
in
a
horrible
fashion
i
got
him
the
mug
and
while
he
drank
i
longed
but
did
not
dare
to
say
are
you
afraid
of
that
i
thought
if
one
could
say
the
word
it
might
break
down
that
dumb
fright
draw
the
flesh
up
again
over
those
bulging
eyes
give
him
a
sort
of
anchor
a
confessional
even
if
it
was
only
me
but
i
did
dare
gayner
is
one
of
those
men
so
pent
up
so
rigid
with
some
inner
indignation
one
can
not
tamper
with
the
locks
again
i
went
and
sat
down
when
next
i
looked
up
he
was
sweating
he
beckoned
to
me
ask
sister
to
send
for
the
doctor
i
ca
stand
this
i
went
and
asked
her
she
sucked
her
little
finger
thoughtfully
give
him
the
thermometer
she
said
he
could
take
it
in
his
mouth
for
if
i
shut
my
lips
they
never
open
i
put
it
under
his
arm
and
waited
while
his
feet
kicked
and
his
hands
twisted
he
was
normal
sister
smiled
but
by
a
coincidence
the
doctor
came
hysteria
he
said
to
sister
in
the
bunk
is
no
one
going
to
reassure
gayner
i
wondered
and
no
one
did
is
the
fear
of
pain
next
brother
to
pain
itself
tetanus
or
the
fear
of
tetanus
a
choice
between
two
nightmares
do
they
admit
that
so
forbidden
to
speak
to
him
i
finished
my
splint
till
but
i
could
bring
myself
to
sit
down
to
it
for
fear
that
the
too
placid
resumption
of
my
duties
should
outrage
him
i
stood
up
which
helped
me
not
him
after
the
dressings
are
over
we
scrub
the
dishes
and
basins
in
the
annexe
in
the
annexe
except
that
there
is
nothing
to
sit
on
there
is
leisure
and
an
invitation
to
reflection
beneath
the
windows
legions
of
white
butterflies
attack
the
which
divides
us
from
the
road
beyond
the
road
there
is
a
camp
from
which
the
dust
flows
all
day
when
the
wind
is
from
the
north
the
dust
is
worse
than
ever
and
breaks
like
a
surf
over
the
cabbages
while
the
butterflies
try
to
rise
above
it
but
they
never
succeed
and
dimly
one
can
see
the
white
wings
beating
in
the
whirlpool
i
shall
never
look
at
white
butterflies
again
without
hearing
the
sounds
from
the
camp
without
seeing
the
ring
of
riders
without
thinking
perhaps
of
the
dairyman
and
of
the
other
dairymen
the
butterflies
do
not
care
for
noise
when
standing
beside
the
the
bugler
blows
the
they
race
in
a
cloud
to
the
far
corner
and
hover
there
until
the
last
note
is
sounded
i
think
it
is
i
who
am
wrong
when
i
consider
the
men
as
citizens
as
persons
of
responsibility
and
the
sister
right
when
she
says
the
boys
taken
from
their
women
from
their
establishments
as
monks
or
boys
or
even
sheep
are
housed
they
do
not
want
perhaps
to
be
reminded
of
an
existence
to
which
they
can
not
return
until
a
limb
is
off
or
the
war
ends
to
what
a
point
they
leave
their
private
lives
behind
them
to
what
a
point
their
lives
are
suspended
on
the
whole
i
find
that
in
hospital
they
do
not
think
of
the
future
or
of
the
past
nor
think
much
at
all
as
far
as
life
and
growth
goes
it
is
a
there
is
really
not
much
to
hope
for
the
leave
is
so
short
the
so
disrupted
that
it
can
not
be
taken
up
with
content
perhaps
it
is
possible
to
let
one
thoughts
play
round
a
life
about
which
one
can
make
no
plans
they
are
adaptable
living
for
the
minute
their
present
hope
for
the
cup
of
tea
for
the
visiting
day
for
the
concert
their
future
hope
for
the
drying
of
the
wound
for
the
day
when
the
sister
fingers
may
press
but
no
drop
be
wrung
from
the
long
scar
is
it
curious
to
wish
so
passionately
for
the
day
which
may
place
them
near
to
death
again
but
the
longing
for
health
is
a
simple
instinct
undarkened
by
logic
yet
some
of
them
have
plans
scutts
has
plans
for
a
fortnight
now
he
has
watched
for
the
post
parcel
come
for
me
sister
small
parcel
or
he
will
meet
the
postman
in
the
corridor
got
my
eye
yet
he
asks
what
will
it
be
like
scutts
we
ask
can
you
move
it
can
you
sleep
in
it
did
he
match
your
other
carefully
you
see
he
says
confidently
it
grand
when
i
get
my
eye
he
says
almost
with
the
same
longing
with
which
he
says
when
i
get
into
civies
scutts
is
not
one
of
those
whose
life
is
stopped
he
has
made
plans
when
i
get
into
civies
and
walk
out
of
here
his
plans
for
six
months
holiday
are
all
writ
down
in
me
notebook
but
what
shall
you
do
scutts
go
to
london
london
no
towns
fer
me
he
will
not
tell
us
what
he
is
going
to
do
secretly
i
believe
it
is
something
he
wanted
to
do
as
a
boy
but
thought
himself
a
fool
to
carry
out
when
he
was
a
man
perhaps
it
is
a
sort
of
walking
tour
among
his
eleven
wounds
he
has
two
crippled
arms
i
safe
enough
from
death
he
says
meaning
france
till
it
fetches
me
in
a
proper
way
perhaps
he
means
to
live
as
though
life
were
really
a
respite
from
death
i
had
a
day
on
the
river
yesterday
seed
yer
with
yer
bit
of
roun
yer
neck
an
yer
little
said
pinker
a
nurse
life
is
one
roun
of
pleasure
said
pinker
to
the
ward
we
had
two
operations
yesterday
one
on
a
sergeant
who
has
won
the
and
has
a
certificate
written
in
gold
which
hangs
above
his
bed
telling
of
his
courage
and
of
one
particular
deed
the
other
on
a
welsh
private
i
wonder
what
the
sergeant
was
like
before
he
won
his
there
is
something
unreal
about
him
he
is
like
a
stage
hero
he
has
a
way
of
saying
now
my
men
who
is
going
to
volunteer
to
fetch
the
dinners
which
is
like
an
invitation
to
go
over
the
top
the
men
gape
when
he
says
that
then
go
on
with
their
cards
it
is
like
a
joke
before
his
operation
he
was
full
of
partially
concealed
boastings
as
to
how
he
would
bear
it
how
he
would
come
to
saying
let
me
get
up
i
can
walk
i
felt
a
sneaking
wish
that
he
should
be
undone
and
show
unusual
weakness
when
the
moment
came
he
did
as
he
had
said
he
would
do
he
laughed
and
waved
as
he
was
wheeled
away
and
in
the
afternoon
when
i
came
on
duty
i
found
him
lying
in
his
bed
conscious
looking
brown
and
strong
and
unconcerned
but
he
ca
let
well
alone
as
i
passed
up
the
ward
to
the
bedside
of
the
welsh
private
i
was
called
by
the
sergeant
and
when
i
stood
by
his
bed
he
whispered
is
that
chap
making
a
fuss
over
there
evan
chap
as
has
had
an
operation
the
same
as
me
he
very
bad
you
do
find
me
making
a
fuss
and
my
leg
is
half
giving
me
something
we
not
all
alike
sergeant
why
should
one
make
a
fuss
and
another
say
nothing
is
your
leg
hurting
you
a
lot
yes
it
is
and
he
screwed
up
his
face
into
a
grimace
after
all
he
was
a
child
try
to
go
to
sleep
i
said
knowing
that
it
was
his
jealousy
that
was
hurting
him
most
i
went
to
evan
he
could
do
nothing
with
his
pain
but
in
its
tightest
embraces
and
crying
he
lay
with
his
large
red
handkerchief
over
his
eyes
oh
evan
i
said
i
could
do
anything
either
oh
dear
dear
dear
dear
dear
he
wailed
in
his
plaintive
welsh
voice
oh
my
dear
leg
my
poor
leg
he
looked
about
nineteen
could
i
lie
on
my
side
no
it
would
make
it
bleed
would
it
he
was
so
docile
and
so
unhappy
the
tears
had
run
down
and
marked
his
pillow
i
turned
it
although
the
sergeant
could
see
will
they
give
me
something
to
make
me
sleep
yes
evan
at
eight
i
said
that
because
i
was
so
sure
of
it
i
had
always
seen
it
done
but
oh
i
should
have
made
more
sure
he
built
on
it
he
leant
all
his
hopes
upon
it
his
little
clenched
hands
seemed
to
be
holding
my
promise
as
firmly
as
though
it
had
been
my
hand
and
sister
said
no
no
it
would
be
better
not
oh
sister
why
not
i
the
least
of
mortals
had
made
a
promise
belonging
only
to
the
gods
oh
sister
why
not
her
reason
was
a
good
one
he
will
want
it
more
later
in
the
night
and
he
ca
have
it
twice
i
ran
back
to
tell
him
so
quickly
but
one
ca
run
back
into
the
past
it
is
wonderful
to
talk
to
men
affectionately
without
exciting
or
implying
love
the
utopian
dreams
of
sixteen
seem
almost
to
be
realized
when
i
sew
splints
they
come
and
talk
to
me
scutts
will
sometimes
talk
for
an
hour
at
first
i
was
so
proud
that
i
dared
hardly
stir
a
finger
for
fear
that
i
should
frighten
him
away
now
i
am
more
sure
of
him
he
never
says
what
to
me
nor
any
longer
jumps
when
i
speak
to
him
as
though
my
every
word
must
carry
some
command
when
i
sew
splints
and
listen
to
scutts
or
the
old
scotch
grocer
or
monk
that
squinting
child
of
whom
pinker
said
monk
got
a
girl
he
don
know
what
a
girl
is
i
think
we
can
not
all
be
efficient
but
this
serves
some
end
for
they
are
complaining
that
i
am
not
efficient
at
first
it
hurt
my
pride
but
it
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
does
one
go
into
a
ward
primarily
to
help
the
patients
or
to
help
the
sister
it
is
not
always
the
same
thing
but
one
must
not
question
discipline
nine
of
the
patients
went
convalescent
they
departed
hobbling
and
on
stretchers
at
two
with
bursts
of
song
plastered
hair
bright
buttons
and
not
a
regret
you
be
able
to
hear
a
pin
fall
nurse
said
one
of
them
i
know
we
shall
and
a
tear
too
i
added
but
they
wo
listen
to
any
such
nonsense
they
are
going
off
to
the
little
convalescent
hospitals
they
are
going
away
to
be
treated
like
men
and
i
must
laugh
and
shake
hands
and
not
dream
of
adding
perhaps
we
shall
see
you
back
again
no
more
was
the
last
cry
i
heard
from
the
nine
how
they
hate
especially
the
city
men
most
especially
pinker
march
down
the
silly
road
he
grumbles
sit
on
the
silly
grass
and
get
sometimes
i
think
that
sewing
splints
will
be
my
undoing
if
i
listen
much
longer
i
shall
see
crooked
they
had
some
small
bottles
of
stout
to
help
us
say
to
the
nine
happiness
is
cheap
last
night
at
dinner
a
man
said
as
he
refilled
his
glass
with
champagne
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
how
much
happiness
there
is
in
a
bottle
the
attack
has
begun
at
this
morning
on
a
front
of
two
miles
so
that
is
why
the
ward
is
so
empty
and
the
ambulances
have
been
hurrying
out
of
the
yard
all
day
we
shall
get
that
convoy
for
which
i
longed
when
the
ward
is
empty
and
there
is
as
now
so
little
work
to
do
how
we
the
women
watch
each
other
over
the
heads
of
the
men
and
because
we
do
not
care
to
watch
nor
are
much
satisfied
with
what
we
see
we
want
more
work
at
what
a
price
we
shall
get
it
scutts
and
monk
talk
to
me
while
i
sew
but
what
about
the
monks
scutts
gayners
whose
wounds
will
never
need
a
dressing
or
a
tube
who
lie
along
a
front
of
two
miles
one
on
his
face
another
on
his
back
since
this
morning
a
lot
of
men
have
died
thank
god
one
can
not
go
on
realizing
death
but
one
need
not
think
of
it
this
is
a
ward
here
are
lucky
ones
even
when
i
look
at
rees
even
when
i
look
at
the
grocer
even
when
i
look
at
the
ward
i
know
that
anything
is
better
than
death
but
i
have
known
a
man
here
and
there
who
did
not
think
so
and
these
men
close
on
death
it
is
true
were
like
strangers
in
the
ward
for
one
can
be
close
on
death
and
remain
familiar
friendly
comprehensible
i
used
to
think
it
is
awful
to
die
but
who
knows
what
compliance
the
years
will
bring
what
is
awful
is
to
die
a
new
came
into
the
ward
yesterday
a
girl
straight
from
home
who
has
never
been
in
a
hospital
before
rees
told
me
she
turned
her
head
away
when
she
saw
me
arm
i
did
once
rees
he
looked
down
at
the
almost
unrecognizable
twelve
inches
which
we
call
rees
wound
and
considered
how
this
red
inch
had
paled
and
the
lips
of
that
incision
were
drawing
together
no
more
me
arm
he
said
at
length
than
he
paused
for
a
simile
me
arm
it
me
wound
he
finally
explained
his
arm
is
stretched
out
at
right
angles
from
his
bed
in
an
iron
cradle
and
has
been
for
six
months
last
night
he
said
i
felt
me
arm
layin
down
by
me
side
an
i
felt
the
fingers
an
tried
to
scratch
me
knee
it
a
feeling
that
bin
comin
on
for
some
time
but
last
night
it
seemed
real
the
pain
of
the
dressing
forces
rees
reason
to
lay
some
claim
to
his
arm
but
when
it
ceases
to
hurt
him
he
detaches
himself
from
it
to
such
a
point
that
the
familiar
to
all
amputations
has
arrived
as
it
were
by
mistake
the
new
does
talk
much
at
present
being
shy
but
i
can
believe
she
will
write
in
her
diary
as
i
wrote
in
mine
my
feet
ache
ache
ache
add
to
that
that
she
is
hungry
because
she
yet
learnt
how
to
break
the
long
stretches
with
hurried
gnawings
behind
a
door
that
she
is
sick
because
the
philosophy
of
rees
is
not
yet
her
philosophy
that
her
hands
and
feet
grow
cold
and
her
body
turns
to
warm
milk
that
she
longs
so
to
sit
on
a
bed
that
she
can
almost
visualize
the
depression
her
body
would
make
on
its
counterpane
and
i
get
a
glimpse
of
the
passage
of
time
and
of
the
effect
of
custom
with
me
the
sickness
and
the
hunger
and
the
ache
are
barely
remembered
it
makes
me
wonder
what
else
is
left
behind
the
old
battle
is
again
in
my
mind
the
struggle
to
feel
pain
to
repel
the
invading
familiarity
here
they
come
one
convoy
last
night
and
another
this
morning
there
is
one
great
burly
man
a
sort
of
bear
whose
dried
blood
has
squeezed
through
bandages
applied
in
seven
places
and
who
for
all
that
mumbles
i
well
if
one
asks
him
how
he
feels
long
before
those
wounds
are
healed
he
will
diagnose
himself
better
than
that
i
well
that
to
say
i
alive
and
i
have
reached
this
bed
and
this
bit
of
meat
and
this
pudding
in
a
tin
he
answers
by
his
standards
but
in
a
few
days
he
will
think
i
am
alive
but
i
might
be
better
and
in
a
few
weeks
is
this
after
all
happiness
how
they
sleep
the
convoy
men
watching
their
wounds
as
we
dress
them
almost
with
a
grave
pleasure
the
passports
to
this
wonderful
sleep
then
when
the
last
is
in
they
lie
back
without
making
themselves
in
the
least
comfortable
without
drawing
up
a
sheet
or
turning
once
upon
the
pillow
and
sleep
just
as
the
head
falls
how
little
women
can
stand
even
the
convoy
can
not
mend
the
pains
of
the
new
i
dare
not
speak
to
her
she
seems
poor
camel
to
be
waiting
for
the
last
straw
but
when
we
wash
the
bowls
together
we
must
talk
she
and
i
together
this
morning
washed
and
scrubbed
rinsed
dried
and
piled
basins
into
little
heaps
and
while
we
washed
we
examined
each
other
she
is
a
born
slave
in
fact
i
almost
think
she
is
born
to
be
tortured
her
manner
with
the
sisters
invites
and
entices
them
to
put
upon
her
her
spiritual
back
is
already
covered
with
sores
i
suppose
she
is
hungry
for
sympathy
but
it
is
really
a
case
in
which
sympathy
can
do
as
much
as
custom
i
showed
her
the
white
butterflies
without
supposing
them
to
be
very
solid
food
she
reminds
me
of
the
man
of
whom
the
sister
said
he
must
stick
it
out
i
might
have
pointed
to
the
convoy
and
suggested
comparisons
but
one
can
not
rub
a
sore
back
some
one
has
applied
the
last
straw
in
the
night
when
i
came
on
duty
a
brisk
little
was
brushing
a
pile
of
dust
along
the
long
boards
to
the
door
the
poor
camel
whose
back
is
broken
is
as
though
she
had
never
existed
either
she
is
ill
or
she
is
banished
such
is
the
secret
diplomacy
of
these
establishments
that
nothing
is
known
of
her
except
her
disappearance
at
least
among
those
whom
one
can
ask
matron
knows
sister
knows
but
these
are
the
inscrutable
smiling
gods
there
is
only
one
man
in
the
ward
i
do
much
care
for
a
tall
boy
with
a
lock
of
fair
hair
and
broken
teeth
he
was
a
sullen
boy
whose
bad
temper
made
his
mouth
repulsive
i
say
was
for
he
is
different
now
now
he
is
feeble
gentle
grateful
and
he
smiles
as
often
as
one
looks
at
him
yesterday
he
went
for
his
operation
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
when
i
came
on
duty
he
was
stirring
and
beginning
to
groan
sister
told
me
to
sit
beside
him
i
went
up
to
the
little
room
of
screens
in
which
he
lay
and
taking
a
wooden
chair
i
slipped
it
in
between
the
screen
and
the
bed
and
sat
down
is
it
the
ether
which
rushes
up
from
between
his
broken
teeth
is
it
the
red
glare
of
the
screens
but
in
ten
minutes
i
am
altered
mesmerized
even
the
size
of
my
surroundings
is
changed
the
screens
high
enough
to
blot
out
a
man
head
are
high
enough
to
blot
out
the
world
the
narrow
bed
becomes
a
field
of
whiteness
the
naked
arm
stretched
towards
me
is
more
wonderful
than
any
that
could
have
belonged
to
a
boy
with
dirty
fair
hair
and
broken
teeth
it
has
veins
rising
along
it
and
the
bright
hairs
are
more
silver
than
golden
the
life
of
the
ward
goes
on
the
clatter
of
cups
for
supper
the
shuffling
of
feet
clad
in
loose
but
here
within
he
and
i
are
living
together
a
concentrated
life
oh
me
back
i
know
i
know
do
i
know
i
am
getting
to
know
for
while
the
men
are
drinking
their
cocoa
i
am
drinking
ether
i
know
how
the
waves
of
the
pain
come
up
and
recede
how
a
little
sleep
just
brushes
the
spirit
but
never
absorbs
it
how
the
arms
will
struggle
up
to
the
air
only
to
be
covered
and
enmeshed
again
in
heat
and
blankets
was
it
in
me
lung
he
pronounces
the
g
a
lancashire
boy
the
shrapnel
he
nods
i
hold
up
the
piece
of
metal
which
has
lain
buried
in
him
these
past
three
weeks
it
has
the
number
engraved
on
it
that
satisfies
him
the
blood
which
has
come
from
between
his
lips
is
in
a
bowl
placed
too
high
for
him
to
see
through
the
crack
in
the
screens
the
man
in
the
bed
opposite
watches
us
unwinkingly
eight
here
is
sister
with
the
syringe
he
will
sleep
now
and
i
can
go
home
if
one
did
not
forget
the
hospital
when
one
leaves
it
life
would
be
very
nice
from
pillar
to
post
the
dairyman
who
has
been
gone
to
another
hospital
these
five
weeks
returned
saying
miserably
as
he
walked
into
the
ward
me
queerer
than
ever
his
eyes
i
think
are
larger
too
and
he
has
still
that
manner
of
looking
as
though
he
thought
some
one
could
do
something
for
him
i
ca
beyond
raising
the
smallest
of
tablets
to
him
with
the
inscription
another
farthing
spent
waker
had
a
birthday
yesterday
and
got
ten
post
cards
and
a
telegram
but
that
is
as
nothing
to
another
anniversary
a
year
i
got
my
wound
two
morning
shall
you
be
awake
waker
yes
how
will
he
celebrate
it
i
would
give
a
lot
to
know
what
will
pass
in
his
mind
for
i
do
yet
understand
this
importance
they
attach
to
such
an
anniversary
one
and
all
they
know
the
exact
hour
and
minute
on
which
their
bit
of
metal
turned
them
for
home
sometimes
a
man
will
whisper
nurse
as
i
go
by
the
bed
and
when
i
stop
i
hear
in
ten
minutes
it
will
be
a
twelvemonth
and
he
fixes
his
eyes
on
me
what
does
he
want
me
to
respond
i
do
know
whether
i
should
be
glad
or
sorry
that
he
got
it
i
ca
imagine
what
he
thinks
of
as
the
minute
ticks
for
i
can
see
by
his
words
that
the
scene
is
blurred
and
no
longer
brings
back
any
picture
did
you
crawl
back
or
walk
i
walked
he
is
hardly
sure
i
know
that
for
some
of
them
for
waker
that
moment
at
two
in
the
morning
changed
his
whole
career
from
that
moment
his
arm
was
paralysed
the
nerves
severed
from
that
moment
football
was
off
and
with
it
his
particular
ambition
and
football
governing
a
kingdom
or
painting
a
picture
a
man
ambition
is
his
ambition
and
when
it
is
wiped
out
his
life
is
changed
but
he
knows
all
that
he
has
had
time
to
think
of
all
that
what
then
does
this
particular
minute
bring
him
they
think
i
know
for
when
they
tell
me
in
that
earnest
voice
that
the
minute
is
approaching
they
take
for
granted
that
i
too
will
share
some
sacrament
with
them
waker
is
not
everything
a
man
should
be
he
is
clever
but
he
is
so
very
brave
after
his
tenth
operation
two
days
ago
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
he
should
have
his
pluggings
changed
under
gas
or
not
the
discussion
went
on
between
the
doctors
over
his
bed
but
the
an√¶sthetist
could
be
found
he
did
take
any
part
in
the
discussion
such
as
saying
yes
i
will
stand
it
but
waited
with
interest
showing
on
his
bony
face
and
when
they
glanced
down
at
him
and
said
let
get
it
through
now
he
rolled
over
to
undo
his
that
i
might
take
off
his
sling
it
was
all
very
fine
for
the
theatre
people
to
fill
his
shoulder
chockful
of
pluggings
while
he
lay
unconscious
on
the
table
they
had
packed
it
as
you
might
stuff
linen
into
a
bag
it
was
another
matter
to
get
it
out
i
did
not
dare
touch
his
hand
with
that
compassion
which
i
have
noticed
here
or
whisper
to
him
it
nearly
over
as
the
forceps
pulled
at
the
stiffened
gauze
it
was
nearly
over
six
inches
deep
the
gauze
stuck
crackling
under
the
pull
of
the
forceps
blood
and
puss
leaping
forward
from
the
cavities
as
the
steady
hand
of
the
doctor
pulled
inch
after
inch
of
the
gauze
to
the
light
and
when
one
hole
was
emptied
there
was
another
five
in
all
sometimes
when
your
mind
has
a
grip
like
iron
your
stomach
will
undo
you
sometimes
when
you
could
say
is
tuesday
the
fifth
of
august
you
faint
there
are
so
many
parts
of
the
body
to
look
after
one
of
the
flock
may
slip
your
control
while
you
are
holding
the
other
by
the
neck
but
waker
had
his
whole
being
in
his
hands
without
so
much
as
clenching
them
when
we
had
finished
and
sister
told
me
to
wipe
the
sweat
on
his
forehead
i
did
so
reluctantly
as
though
one
were
being
too
exacting
in
drawing
attention
to
so
small
a
sign
i
must
say
that
the
dairyman
seems
to
me
quite
mad
and
i
only
wonder
how
little
it
is
noticed
he
will
sit
in
a
chair
beside
palmer
for
hours
raising
and
lowering
his
eyebrows
and
fitting
imaginary
gloves
on
to
his
fingers
an
inspecting
general
pausing
at
his
bed
this
morning
said
a
dairyman
are
you
frightened
of
horses
are
you
then
what
do
you
do
about
the
cows
he
was
pleased
with
his
own
joke
and
the
dairyman
smiled
too
uncomprehendingly
his
eyebrows
shooting
up
and
down
like
wings
such
jokes
mean
nothing
to
him
he
is
where
no
joke
but
his
own
will
ever
please
him
any
more
palmer
does
like
sitting
near
him
but
since
it
is
too
much
trouble
to
move
he
allows
it
poor
palmer
who
has
a
piece
of
metal
somewhere
in
his
brain
and
is
never
seen
without
one
long
hand
to
his
aching
head
he
said
to
me
yesterday
when
i
asked
him
which
convalescent
home
he
was
going
to
it
does
matter
we
both
go
to
the
same
kind
before
long
jerking
his
thumb
at
the
dairyman
as
for
the
latter
there
surely
can
be
no
escape
but
for
palmer
they
wo
take
it
out
too
risky
seen
my
picture
no
you
look
at
it
right
in
the
middle
of
the
brain
seems
funny
that
if
i
say
i
willing
to
risk
it
why
they
should
be
you
willing
to
risk
it
i
only
nineteen
what
the
good
of
my
head
to
me
i
ca
remember
the
name
of
the
last
hospital
i
was
at
ah
these
hurried
conversations
sandwiched
between
my
duties
when
in
four
sentences
the
distilled
essence
of
bitterness
is
dropped
into
my
ear
sister
what
will
they
do
with
palmer
they
are
going
to
discharge
him
they
wo
operate
but
what
will
happen
to
him
i
do
know
but
if
he
is
willing
to
risk
his
life
to
save
his
brain
can
they
still
refuse
they
wo
operate
pinker
is
full
of
grains
of
knowledge
he
has
just
discovered
a
wonderful
justification
for
not
getting
up
directly
he
is
told
off
for
a
job
i
never
refuse
a
nurse
he
said
as
he
thoughtfully
picked
over
the
potatoes
men
spuds
he
says
to
excuse
himself
for
taking
all
the
small
ones
i
never
refuse
a
nurse
but
i
like
to
finish
me
game
of
draughts
first
like
drake
pinker
notices
everything
he
took
the
grocer
for
a
ride
on
the
tram
yesterday
got
so
excited
he
got
singing
an
the
on
his
neck
goin
fit
to
burst
were
he
bill
he
appealed
to
monk
whose
name
is
george
by
the
way
i
wonder
when
people
will
stop
calling
them
tommy
and
call
them
bill
i
never
heard
the
word
tommy
in
a
soldier
mouth
he
was
a
man
but
every
mate
called
ai
bill
from
the
camp
across
the
road
the
words
of
command
float
in
through
the
ward
window
halt
and
left
wheel
and
right
wheel
they
float
into
the
ward
bearing
the
sense
of
heat
and
dust
and
of
the
bumping
of
the
saddle
the
dairyman
has
perhaps
put
me
a
bit
against
the
camp
across
the
road
when
the
dressings
are
finished
and
we
scrub
the
enamel
bowls
in
the
annexe
one
can
see
all
the
dairymen
and
all
the
plumbers
and
shopwalkers
bumping
up
and
down
in
a
ring
amid
a
cloud
of
dust
while
the
voice
of
the
sergeant
cries
out
those
things
that
my
dairyman
used
to
think
of
in
his
sleep
then
the
jumps
go
up
left
wheel
right
wheel
and
now
cross
your
stirrups
one
out
of
every
four
of
them
is
clinging
grabbing
swaying
the
seventh
is
off
it
was
a
long
fight
he
went
almost
round
the
horse
neck
before
he
fell
we
must
win
the
war
win
the
war
win
the

every
sort
of
price

be
paid
every
mud
of

coinage
the
pennies

in
odd
places
as
well

the
golden
coin
of
life
which
is
spent
across
the
water
all

long
the
words
of

come
over
the
