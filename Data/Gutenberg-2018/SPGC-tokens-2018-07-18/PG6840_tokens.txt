lucia
by

chapter
one
though
the
sun
was
hot
on
this
july
morning
mrs
lucas
preferred
to
cover
the
that
lay
between
the
station
and
her
house
on
her
own
brisk
feet
and
sent
on
her
maid
and
her
luggage
in
the
fly
that
her
husband
had
ordered
to
meet
her
after
those
four
hours
in
the
train
a
short
walk
would
be
pleasant
but
though
she
veiled
it
from
her
conscious
mind
another
motive
engineered
prompted
her
action
it
would
of
course
be
universally
known
to
all
her
friends
in
riseholme
that
she
was
arriving
today
by
the
and
at
that
hour
the
village
street
would
be
sure
to
be
full
of
them
they
would
see
the
fly
with
luggage
draw
up
at
the
door
of
the
hurst
and
nobody
except
her
maid
would
get
out
that
would
be
an
interesting
thing
for
them
it
would
cause
one
of
those
little
thrills
of
pleasant
excitement
and
conjectural
exercise
which
supplied
riseholme
with
its
emotional
daily
bread
they
would
all
wonder
what
had
happened
to
her
whether
she
had
been
taken
ill
at
the
very
last
moment
before
leaving
town
and
with
her
fortitude
and
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
had
sent
her
maid
on
to
assure
her
husband
that
he
need
not
be
anxious
that
would
clearly
be
mrs
quantock
suggestion
for
mrs
quantock
mind
devoted
as
it
was
now
to
the
study
of
christian
science
and
the
determination
to
deny
the
existence
of
pain
disease
and
death
as
regards
herself
was
always
full
of
the
gloomiest
views
as
regards
her
friends
and
on
the
slightest
excuse
pictured
that
they
poor
blind
things
were
suffering
from
false
claims
indeed
given
that
the
fly
had
already
arrived
at
the
hurst
and
that
its
arrival
had
at
this
moment
been
seen
by
or
reported
to
daisy
quantock
the
chances
were
vastly
in
favour
of
that
lady
having
already
started
in
to
give
mrs
lucas
absent
treatment
very
likely
georgie
pillson
had
also
seen
the
anticlimax
of
the
arrival
but
he
would
hazard
a
much
more
probable
though
erroneous
solution
of
her
absence
he
would
certainly
guess
that
she
had
sent
on
her
maid
with
her
luggage
to
the
station
in
order
to
take
a
seat
for
her
while
she
herself
oblivious
of
the
passage
of
time
was
spending
her
last
half
hour
in
contemplation
of
the
italian
masterpieces
at
the
national
gallery
or
the
greek
bronzes
at
the
british
museum
certainly
she
would
not
be
at
the
royal
academy
for
the
culture
of
riseholme
led
by
herself
rejected
as
valueless
all
artistic
efforts
later
than
the
death
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
and
a
great
deal
of
what
went
before
her
husband
with
his
firm
grasp
of
the
obvious
on
the
other
hand
would
be
disappointingly
capable
even
before
her
maid
confirmed
his
conjecture
of
concluding
that
she
had
merely
walked
from
the
station
the
motive
then
that
made
her
send
her
cab
on
though
subconsciously
generated
soon
penetrated
into
her
consciousness
and
these
guesses
at
what
other
people
would
think
when
they
saw
it
arrive
without
her
sprang
from
the
dramatic
element
that
formed
so
large
a
part
of
her
mentality
and
made
her
always
take
as
by
right
divine
the
leading
part
in
the
histrionic
entertainments
with
which
the
cultured
of
riseholme
beguiled
or
rather
strenuously
occupied
such
moments
as
could
be
spared
from
their
studies
of
art
and
literature
and
their
social
engagements
indeed
she
did
not
usually
stop
at
taking
the
leading
part
but
if
possible
doubled
another
character
with
it
as
well
as
being
and
adapter
if
not
designer
of
scenery
whatever
she
did
and
really
she
did
an
incredible
deal
she
did
it
with
all
the
might
of
her
dramatic
perception
did
it
in
fact
with
such
earnestness
that
she
had
no
time
to
have
an
eye
to
the
gallery
at
all
she
simply
contemplated
herself
and
her
own
vigorous
accomplishment
when
she
played
the
piano
as
she
frequently
did
reserving
an
hour
for
practice
every
day
she
cared
not
in
the
smallest
degree
for
what
anybody
who
passed
down
the
road
outside
her
house
might
be
thinking
of
the
roulades
that
poured
from
her
open
window
she
was
simply
emmeline
lucas
absorbed
in
glorious
bach
or
dainty
scarletti
or
noble
beethoven
the
latter
perhaps
was
her
favorite
composer
and
many
were
the
evenings
when
with
lights
quenched
and
only
the
soft
effulgence
of
the
moon
pouring
in
through
the
uncurtained
windows
she
sat
with
her
profile
or
like
perhaps
to
the
head
on
a
postage
stamp
against
the
dark
oak
walls
of
her
and
entranced
herself
and
her
listeners
if
there
were
people
to
dinner
with
the
exquisite
pathos
of
the
first
movement
of
the
moonlight
sonata
devotedly
as
she
worshipped
the
master
whose
picture
hung
above
her
steinway
grand
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
believe
that
the
two
succeeding
movements
were
on
the
same
sublime
level
as
the
first
and
besides
they
went
very
much
faster
but
she
had
seriously
thought
as
she
came
down
in
the
train
today
and
planned
her
fresh
activities
at
home
of
trying
to
master
them
so
that
she
could
get
through
their
intricacies
with
tolerable
accuracy
until
then
she
would
assuredly
stop
at
the
end
of
the
first
movement
in
these
moonlit
seances
and
say
that
the
other
two
were
more
like
morning
and
afternoon
then
with
a
sigh
she
would
softly
shut
the
piano
lid
and
perhaps
wiping
a
little
genuine
moisture
from
her
eyes
would
turn
on
the
electric
light
and
taking
up
a
book
from
the
table
in
which
a
marked
the
extent
of
her
penetration
say
georgie
you
must
really
promise
me
to
read
this
life
of
antonino
caporelli
the
moment
i
have
finished
it
i
never
understood
the
rise
of
the
venetian
school
before
as
i
read
i
can
smell
the
salt
tide
creeping
up
over
the
lagoon
and
see
the
campanile
of
dear
torcello
and
georgie
would
put
down
the
tambour
on
which
he
was
working
his
copy
of
an
italian
cope
and
sigh
too
you
are
too
wonderful
he
would
say
how
do
you
find
time
for
everything
she
rejoined
with
the
apophthegm
that
made
the
rounds
of
riseholme
next
day
my
dear
it
is
just
busy
people
that
have
time
for
everything
it
might
be
thought
that
even
such
activities
as
have
here
been
indicated
would
be
enough
to
occupy
anyone
so
busily
that
he
would
positively
not
have
time
for
more
but
such
was
far
from
being
the
case
with
mrs
lucas
just
as
the
painter
rubens
amused
himself
with
being
the
ambassador
to
the
court
of
james
a
sufficient
career
in
itself
for
most
busy
men
so
mrs
lucas
amused
herself
in
the
intervals
of
her
pursuit
of
art
for
art
sake
with
being
not
only
an
ambassador
but
a
monarch
riseholme
might
perhaps
according
to
the
crude
materialism
of
maps
be
included
in
the
kingdom
of
great
britain
but
in
a
more
real
and
inward
sense
it
formed
a
complete
kingdom
of
its
own
and
its
queen
was
undoubtedly
mrs
lucas
who
ruled
it
with
a
secure
autocracy
pleasant
to
contemplate
at
a
time
when
thrones
were
toppling
and
imperial
crowns
whirling
like
dead
leaves
down
the
autumn
winds
the
ruler
of
riseholme
happier
than
he
of
russia
had
no
need
to
fear
the
finger
of
bolshevism
writing
on
the
wall
for
there
was
not
in
the
whole
of
that
vat
which
seethed
so
pleasantly
with
culture
one
bubble
of
revolutionary
ferment
here
there
was
neither
poverty
nor
discontent
nor
muttered
menace
of
any
upheaval
mrs
lucas
busy
and
serene
worked
harder
than
any
of
her
subjects
and
exercised
an
autocratic
control
over
a
nominal
democracy
something
of
the
consciousness
of
her
sovereignty
was
in
her
mind
as
she
turned
the
last
hot
corner
of
the
road
and
came
in
sight
of
the
village
street
that
constituted
her
kingdom
indeed
it
belonged
to
her
as
treasure
trove
belongs
to
the
crown
for
it
was
she
who
had
been
the
first
to
begin
the
transformation
of
this
remote
elizabethan
village
into
the
palace
of
culture
that
was
now
reared
on
the
spot
where
ten
years
ago
an
agricultural
population
had
led
bovine
and
unilluminated
lives
in
their
cottages
of
grey
stone
or
brick
and
timber
before
that
while
her
husband
was
amassing
a
fortune
comfortable
in
amount
and
respectable
in
origin
at
the
bar
she
had
merely
held
up
a
small
dim
lamp
of
culture
in
onslow
gardens
but
both
her
ambition
and
his
had
been
to
bask
and
be
busy
in
artistic
realms
of
their
own
when
the
materialistic
needs
were
provided
for
by
sound
investments
and
so
when
there
were
the
requisite
thousands
of
pounds
in
secure
securities
she
had
easily
persuaded
him
to
buy
three
of
these
cottages
that
stood
together
in
a
low
block
then
by
judicious
removal
of
she
had
with
the
aid
of
a
sympathetic
architect
transmuted
them
into
a
most
comfortable
dwelling
subsequently
building
on
to
them
a
new
wing
that
ran
at
right
angles
at
the
back
which
was
if
anything
a
shade
more
inexorably
elizabethan
than
the
stem
onto
which
it
was
grafted
for
here
was
situated
the
famous
with
rushes
on
the
floor
and
a
dresser
ranged
with
pewter
tankards
and
leaded
of
glass
so
antique
that
it
was
practically
impossible
to
see
out
of
them
it
had
a
huge
open
fireplace
framed
in
with
a
seat
on
each
side
of
the
hearth
within
the
chimney
and
a
genuine
spit
hung
over
the
middle
of
the
fire
here
though
in
the
rest
of
the
house
she
had
for
the
sake
of
convenience
allowed
the
installation
of
electric
light
there
was
no
such
concession
made
and
sconces
on
the
walls
held
dim
iron
lamps
so
that
only
those
of
the
most
acute
vision
were
able
to
read
even
then
reading
was
difficult
for
the
on
the
table
contained
nothing
but
a
few
crabbed
volumes
dating
from
not
later
than
the
early
seventeenth
century
and
you
had
to
be
in
a
frantically
elizabethan
frame
of
mind
to
be
at
ease
there
but
mrs
lucas
often
spent
some
of
her
rare
leisure
moments
in
the
playing
on
the
virginal
that
stood
in
the
window
or
kippering
herself
in
the
fumes
of
the
as
with
streaming
eyes
she
deciphered
an
elzevir
horace
rather
late
for
inclusion
under
the
rule
but
an
undoubted
bargain
the
house
stood
at
the
end
of
the
village
that
was
nearest
the
station
and
thus
when
the
panorama
of
her
kingdom
opened
before
her
she
had
but
a
few
steps
further
to
go
a
bought
entire
from
a
neighboring
farm
and
transplanted
with
solid
lumps
of
earth
and
indignant
snails
around
its
roots
separated
the
small
oblong
of
garden
from
the
road
and
cast
monstrous
shadows
of
the
shapes
into
which
it
was
cut
across
the
little
lawns
inside
here
as
was
only
right
and
proper
there
was
not
a
flower
to
be
found
save
such
as
were
mentioned
in
the
plays
of
shakespeare
indeed
it
was
called
shakespeare
garden
and
the
bed
that
ran
below
the
windows
of
the
dining
room
was
border
for
it
consisted
solely
of
those
flowers
which
that
distraught
maiden
distributed
to
her
friends
when
she
should
have
been
in
a
lunatic
asylum
mrs
lucas
often
reflected
how
lucky
it
was
that
such
institutions
were
unknown
in
elizabeth
day
or
that
if
known
shakespeare
artistically
ignored
their
existence
pansies
naturally
formed
the
chief
decoration
though
there
were
some
very
flourishing
plants
of
rue
mrs
lucas
always
wore
a
little
bunch
of
them
when
in
flower
to
inspire
her
thoughts
and
found
them
wonderfully
efficacious
round
the
sundial
which
was
set
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
squares
of
grass
between
which
a
path
of
broken
led
to
the
front
door
was
a
circular
border
now
in
july
sadly
vacant
for
it
harboured
only
the
enumerated
by
perdita
but
the
first
day
every
year
when
perdita
border
put
forth
its
earliest
blossom
was
a
delicious
anniversary
and
the
news
of
it
spread
like
through
mrs
lucas
kingdom
and
her
subjects
were
very
joyful
and
came
to
salute
the
violet
or
daffodil
or
whatever
it
was
the
three
cottages
dexterously
transformed
into
the
hurst
presented
a
charmingly
irregular
and
picturesque
front
two
were
of
the
grey
stone
of
the
district
and
the
middle
one
to
the
door
of
which
led
the
paved
path
of
brick
and
timber
latticed
windows
with
stone
mullions
gave
little
light
to
the
room
within
and
certain
new
windows
had
been
added
these
could
be
detected
by
the
observant
eye
for
they
had
a
markedly
older
appearance
than
the
rest
the
similarly
seemed
as
if
it
must
have
been
made
years
before
the
house
the
fact
being
that
the
one
which
mrs
lucas
had
found
there
was
too
dilapidated
to
be
of
the
slightest
service
in
keeping
out
wind
or
wet
or
undesired
callers
she
had
therefore
caused
to
be
constructed
an
even
older
one
made
from
the
of
a
dismantled
barn
and
had
it
studded
with
large
iron
nails
of
antique
pattern
made
by
the
village
blacksmith
he
had
arranged
some
of
them
to
look
as
if
they
spelled
over
the
door
hung
an
and
into
the
space
where
once
the
sign
had
swung
was
now
inserted
a
lantern
in
which
was
ensconced
well
hidden
from
view
by
its
patinated
glass
sides
an
electric
light
this
was
one
of
the
necessary
concessions
to
modern
convenience
for
no
lamp
nurtured
on
oil
would
pierce
those
genuinely
opaque
panes
and
illuminate
the
path
to
the
gate
better
to
have
an
electric
light
than
cause
your
guests
to
plunge
into
perdita
border
by
the
side
of
this
hung
a
heavy
iron
ending
in
a
mermaid
when
first
mrs
lucas
had
that
installed
it
was
a
in
the
sense
that
an
extremely
athletic
man
could
if
he
used
both
hands
and
planted
his
feet
firmly
cause
it
to
move
so
that
a
huge
bronze
bell
swung
in
the
servants
passage
and
eventually
gave
tongue
if
the
athlete
continued
pulling
with
vibrations
so
sonorous
that
the
from
the
ceiling
fell
down
in
flakes
she
had
therefore
made
another
concession
to
the
frailty
of
the
present
generation
and
the
inconveniences
of
having
whitewash
falling
into
salads
and
puddings
on
their
way
to
the
dining
room
and
now
at
the
back
of
the
mermaid
tail
was
a
potent
little
bone
button
coloured
black
and
practically
invisible
and
thus
the
had
been
converted
into
an
electric
in
this
way
visitors
could
make
their
advent
known
without
violent
exertion
the
mermaid
lost
no
visible
whit
of
her
elizabethan
virginity
and
the
spirit
of
shakespeare
wandering
in
his
garden
would
not
notice
any
anachronism
he
could
not
in
fact
for
there
was
none
to
notice
though
mrs
lucas
parents
had
bestowed
the
name
of
emmeline
on
her
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
was
always
known
among
the
more
intimate
of
her
subjects
as
lucia
pronounced
of
course
in
the
italian
mode
la
lucia
the
wife
of
lucas
and
it
was
as
lucia
mia
that
her
husband
hailed
her
as
he
met
her
at
the
door
of
the
hurst
he
had
been
watching
for
her
arrival
from
the
panes
of
the
parlour
while
he
meditated
upon
one
of
the
little
prose
poems
which
formed
so
delectable
a
contribution
to
the
culture
of
riseholme
for
though
as
had
been
hinted
he
had
in
practical
life
a
firm
grasp
of
the
obvious
there
were
windows
in
his
soul
which
looked
out
onto
vague
and
ethereal
prospects
which
so
far
from
being
obvious
were
only
dimly
intelligible
in
form
these
odes
were
cast
in
the
loose
rhythms
of
walt
whitman
but
their
smooth
suavity
and
their
contents
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
productions
of
that
barbaric
bard
whose
works
were
quite
unknown
in
riseholme
already
a
couple
of
volumes
of
these
had
been
published
not
of
course
in
the
hard
establishment
of
london
but
at
ye
sign
of
ye
daffodil
on
the
village
green
where
type
was
set
up
by
hand
and
very
little
but
that
of
the
best
was
printed
the
press
had
only
been
recently
started
at
mr
expense
but
it
had
put
forth
a
reprint
of
shakespeare
sonnets
already
as
well
as
his
own
poems
they
were
printed
in
blunt
type
on
thick
yellowish
paper
the
edges
of
which
seemed
as
if
they
had
been
cut
by
the
forefinger
of
an
impatient
reader
so
ragged
and
irregular
were
they
and
they
were
bound
in
vellum
the
titles
of
these
two
slim
flowers
of
poetry
flotsam
and
jetsam
were
printed
in
black
letter
type
and
the
covers
were
further
adorned
with
a
sort
of
embossed
seal
and
with
antique
looking
tapes
so
that
you
could
tie
it
all
up
with
two
bows
when
you
had
finished
with
mr
lucas
flotsam
for
the
time
being
and
turned
to
untie
the
jetsam
today
the
of
loneliness
had
not
been
getting
on
very
well
and
philip
lucas
was
glad
to
hear
the
click
of
the
which
showed
that
his
loneliness
was
over
for
the
present
and
looking
up
he
saw
his
wife
figure
waveringly
presented
to
his
eyes
through
the
twisted
and
knotty
glass
of
the
parlour
window
which
had
taken
so
long
to
collect
but
which
now
completely
replaced
the
plain
commonplace
unrefracting
stuff
which
was
there
before
he
jumped
up
with
an
alacrity
remarkable
in
so
solid
and
a
person
and
had
thrown
open
the
before
lucia
had
traversed
the
path
of
broken
for
she
had
lingered
for
a
sad
moment
at
perdita
empty
border
he
exclaimed
so
you
walked
from
the
station
peppino
mio
she
said
he
kissed
her
and
relapsed
into
shakespeare
tongue
for
their
italian
though
firm
and
perfect
as
far
as
it
went
could
not
be
considered
as
going
far
and
was
useless
for
conversational
purposes
unless
they
merely
wanted
to
greet
each
other
or
to
know
the
time
but
it
was
interesting
to
talk
italian
however
little
way
it
went
said
he
and
it
delightful
to
have
you
home
again
and
how
was
london
he
asked
in
the
sort
of
tone
in
which
he
might
have
enquired
after
the
health
of
a
poor
relation
who
was
not
likely
to
recover
she
smiled
rather
sadly
terrifically
busy
about
nothing
she
said
all
this
fortnight
i
have
scarcely
had
a
moment
to
myself
lunches
dinners
parties
of
all
kinds
i
could
not
go
to
half
the
gatherings
i
was
bidden
to
dear
good
south
kensington
chelsea
too
when
london
does
manage
to
catch
you
it
is
no
wonder
it
makes
the
most
of
you
he
said
you
must
blame
london
for
that
no
dear
i
do
everyone
was
tremendously
kind
and
hospitable
they
all
did
their
best
if
i
blame
anyone
i
blame
myself
but
i
think
this
riseholme
life
with
its
finish
and
its
exquisiteness
spoils
one
for
other
places
london
is
like
a
it
has
no
true
life
of
its
own
there
is
no
delicacy
no
appreciation
of
fine
shades
individualism
has
no
existence
there
everyone
gabbles
together
gabbles
and
gobbles
am
not
i
naughty
if
there
is
a
concert
in
a
private
house
you
know
my
views
about
music
and
the
impossibility
of
hearing
music
at
all
if
you
are
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
row
of
people
even
then
the
moment
it
is
over
you
are
whisked
away
to
supper
or
somebody
wants
to
have
a
few
words
there
is
always
a
crowd
there
is
always
food
you
can
not
be
alone
and
it
is
only
in
loneliness
as
goethe
says
that
your
perceptions
put
forth
their
flowers
no
one
in
london
has
time
to
listen
they
are
all
thinking
about
who
is
there
and
who
is
there
and
what
is
the
next
thing
the
exquisite
present
as
you
put
it
in
one
of
your
poems
has
no
existence
there
it
is
always
the
feverish
future
delicious
phrase
i
should
have
stolen
that
gem
for
my
poor
poems
if
you
had
discovered
it
before
she
was
too
much
used
to
this
incense
to
do
more
than
sniff
it
in
unconsciously
and
she
went
on
with
her
tremendous
indictment
it
is
that
i
find
fault
with
london
for
being
so
busy
she
said
with
strict
impartiality
for
if
being
busy
was
a
crime
i
am
sure
there
are
few
of
us
here
who
would
escape
hanging
but
take
my
life
here
or
yours
for
that
matter
well
mine
if
you
like
often
and
often
i
am
alone
from
breakfast
till
but
in
those
hours
i
get
through
more
that
is
worth
doing
than
london
gets
through
in
a
day
and
a
night
i
have
an
hour
at
my
music
not
looking
about
and
wondering
who
my
neighbours
are
but
learning
studying
drinking
in
divine
melody
then
i
have
my
letters
to
write
and
you
know
what
that
means
and
i
still
have
time
for
an
hour
reading
so
that
when
you
come
to
tell
me
lunch
is
ready
you
will
find
that
i
have
been
wandering
through
venetian
churches
or
sitting
in
that
little
dark
room
at
weimar
or
was
it
leipsic
how
would
those
same
hours
have
passed
in
london
sitting
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
in
the
park
with
dearest
aggie
pointing
out
to
me
with
thrills
of
breathless
excitement
a
woman
who
was
in
the
divorce
court
or
a
coroneted
bankrupt
then
she
would
drag
me
off
to
some
terrible
private
view
full
of
the
same
people
all
staring
at
and
gabbling
to
each
other
or
looking
at
pictures
that
made
poor
me
gasp
and
shudder
no
i
am
thankful
to
be
back
at
my
own
sweet
riseholme
again
i
can
work
and
think
here
she
looked
round
the
panelled
with
a
glow
of
warm
content
at
being
at
home
again
that
quite
eclipsed
the
mere
physical
heat
produced
by
her
walk
from
the
station
wherever
her
eyes
fell
those
sharp
dark
eyes
that
resembled
buttons
covered
with
shiny
american
cloth
they
saw
nothing
that
jarred
as
so
much
in
london
jarred
there
were
bright
brass
jugs
on
the
window
sill
a
bowl
of
on
the
black
table
in
the
centre
an
oak
settee
by
the
open
fireplace
a
couple
of
persian
rugs
on
the
polished
floor
the
room
had
its
quaintness
too
such
as
she
had
alluded
to
in
her
memorable
essay
read
before
the
riseholme
literary
society
called
humour
in
furniture
and
a
brass
milkcan
served
as
a
receptacle
for
sticks
and
umbrellas
equally
quaint
was
the
dish
of
highly
realistic
stone
fruit
that
stood
beside
the
and
the
furry
japanese
spider
that
sprawled
in
a
silk
web
over
the
window
such
was
the
fearful
verisimilitude
of
this
that
lucia
new
housemaid
had
once
fled
from
her
duties
in
the
early
morning
to
seek
the
assistance
of
the
gardener
in
killing
it
the
dish
of
stone
fruit
had
scored
a
similar
success
for
once
she
had
said
to
georgie
pillson
ah
my
gardener
has
sent
in
some
early
apples
and
pears
wo
you
take
one
home
with
you
it
was
not
till
the
weight
of
the
pear
he
swiftly
selected
the
largest
betrayed
the
joke
that
he
had
any
notion
that
they
were
not
real
ones
but
then
georgie
had
had
his
revenge
for
waiting
his
opportunity
he
had
inserted
a
real
pear
among
those
stony
specimens
and
again
passing
through
with
lucia
he
picked
it
out
and
with
lips
drawn
back
had
snapped
at
it
with
all
the
force
of
his
jaws
for
the
moment
she
had
felt
quite
faint
at
the
thought
of
his
teeth
crashing
into
fragments
these
humorous
touches
were
altered
from
time
to
time
the
spider
for
instance
might
be
taken
down
and
replaced
by
a
china
canary
in
a
chippendale
cage
and
the
selection
of
the
entrance
hall
for
those
whimsicalities
was
intentional
for
guests
found
something
to
smile
at
as
they
took
off
their
cloaks
and
entered
the
drawing
room
with
a
topic
on
their
lips
something
light
something
amusing
about
what
they
had
seen
for
the
gong
similarly
was
sometimes
substituted
a
set
of
bells
that
had
once
decked
the
collar
of
the
leading
horse
in
a
waggoner
team
somewhere
in
flanders
in
fact
when
lucia
was
at
home
there
was
often
a
new
little
quaintness
for
quite
a
sequence
of
days
and
she
had
held
out
hopes
to
the
literary
society
that
perhaps
some
day
when
she
was
not
so
rushed
she
would
jot
down
material
for
a
sequel
to
her
essay
or
write
another
covering
a
rather
larger
field
on
the
gambits
of
conversation
derived
from
furniture
on
the
table
there
was
a
pile
of
letters
waiting
for
mrs
lucas
for
yesterday
post
had
not
been
forwarded
her
for
fear
of
its
missing
her
london
postmen
were
probably
very
careless
and
untrustworthy
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
as
she
saw
the
volume
of
her
correspondence
but
i
shall
be
very
naughty
she
said
and
not
look
at
one
of
them
till
after
lunch
take
them
away
and
promise
me
to
lock
them
up
till
then
and
not
give
them
me
however
much
i
beg
then
i
will
get
into
the
saddle
again
such
a
dear
saddle
too
and
tackle
them
i
shall
have
a
stroll
in
the
garden
till
the
bell
rings
what
is
it
that
nietzsche
says
about
the
necessity
to
yourself
every
now
and
then
i
must
myself
peppino
remembered
the
quotation
which
had
occurred
in
a
review
of
some
work
of
that
celebrated
author
where
lucia
had
also
seen
it
and
went
back
with
the
force
of
contrast
to
aid
him
to
his
of
loneliness
while
his
wife
went
through
the
into
the
garden
in
order
to
soak
herself
once
more
in
the
cultured
atmosphere
in
this
garden
behind
the
house
there
was
no
attempt
to
construct
a
shakespearian
plot
for
as
she
so
rightly
observed
shakespeare
who
loved
flowers
so
well
would
wish
her
to
enjoy
every
conceivable
horticultural
treasure
but
furniture
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
place
and
there
were
statues
and
sundials
and
scattered
about
with
almost
too
profuse
a
hand
mottos
also
were
in
great
evidence
and
while
a
sundial
reminded
you
that
fugit
an
enticing
somewhat
bewilderingly
bade
you
to
bide
a
wee
but
then
again
the
rustic
seat
in
the
pleached
alley
of
laburnums
had
carved
on
its
back
much
have
i
travelled
in
the
realms
of
gold
so
that
meditating
on
keats
you
could
bide
a
wee
with
a
clear
conscience
indeed
so
copious
was
the
wealth
of
familiar
and
stimulating
quotations
that
one
of
her
subjects
had
once
said
that
to
stroll
in
lucia
garden
was
not
only
to
enjoy
her
lovely
flowers
but
to
spend
a
simultaneous
half
hour
with
the
best
authors
there
was
a
dovecote
of
course
but
since
the
cats
always
killed
the
doves
mrs
lucas
had
put
up
round
the
desecrated
home
several
pigeons
of
copenhagen
china
which
were
both
imperishable
as
regards
cats
and
also
carried
out
the
suggestion
of
humour
in
furniture
the
humour
had
attained
the
highest
point
of
felicity
when
peppino
concealed
a
mechanical
nightingale
in
a
bush
which
sang
in
the
most
realistic
manner
when
you
pulled
a
string
georgie
had
not
yet
seen
the
copenhagen
pigeons
or
being
rather
thought
they
were
real
then
oh
then
peppino
pulled
the
string
and
for
quite
a
long
time
georgie
listened
entranced
to
their
melodious
cooings
that
served
him
out
for
his
trap
about
the
real
pear
introduced
among
the
stone
specimens
for
in
spite
of
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
culture
at
riseholme
riseholme
knew
how
to
in
and
its
strenuous
culture
was
often
refreshed
by
these
light
refined
touches
mrs
lucas
walked
quickly
and
decisively
up
and
down
the
paths
as
she
waited
for
the
summons
to
lunch
for
the
activity
of
her
mind
reacted
on
her
body
making
her
brisk
in
movement
on
each
side
of
her
forehead
were
hard
neat
undulations
of
black
hair
that
concealed
the
tips
of
her
ears
she
had
laid
aside
her
london
hat
and
carried
a
red
cotton
contadina
umbrella
which
threw
a
rosy
glow
onto
the
oval
of
her
thin
face
and
its
colourless
complexion
she
bore
the
weight
of
her
forty
years
extremely
lightly
and
but
for
the
droop
of
skin
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
she
might
have
passed
as
a
much
younger
woman
her
face
was
otherwise
unlined
and
bore
no
trace
of
the
ravages
of
emotional
living
which
both
ages
and
softens
certainly
there
was
nothing
soft
about
her
and
very
little
of
the
signs
of
age
and
it
would
have
been
reasonable
to
conjecture
that
twenty
years
later
she
would
look
but
little
older
than
she
did
today
for
such
emotions
as
she
was
victim
of
were
the
sterile
and
ageless
emotions
of
art
such
desires
as
beset
her
were
not
connected
with
her
affections
but
her
ambitions
dynasty
she
had
none
for
she
was
childless
and
thus
her
ambitions
were
limited
to
the
permanence
and
security
of
her
own
throne
as
queen
of
riseholme
she
really
asked
nothing
more
of
life
than
the
continuance
of
such
harvests
as
she
had
so
plenteously
reaped
for
these
last
ten
years
as
long
as
she
directed
the
life
of
riseholme
took
the
lead
in
its
culture
and
entertainment
and
was
the
undisputed
of
all
its
inspirations
and
from
time
to
time
refreshed
her
memory
as
to
the
utter
inferiority
of
london
she
wanted
nothing
more
but
to
secure
that
she
dedicated
all
that
she
had
of
ease
leisure
and
income
being
practically
indefatigable
the
loss
of
ease
and
leisure
troubled
her
but
little
and
being
in
extremely
comfortable
circumstances
she
had
no
need
to
economise
in
her
hospitalities
she
might
easily
look
forward
to
enjoying
an
unchanging
activity
while
generations
of
youth
withered
round
her
and
no
star
remotely
rising
had
as
yet
threatened
to
dim
her
unrivalled
effulgence
though
essentially
autocratic
her
subjects
were
allowed
and
even
encouraged
to
develop
their
own
minds
on
their
own
lines
provided
always
that
those
lines
met
at
the
junction
where
she
was
with
regard
to
religion
finally
it
may
be
briefly
said
that
she
believed
in
god
in
much
the
same
way
as
she
believed
in
australia
for
she
had
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
existence
of
either
and
she
went
to
church
on
sunday
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
she
would
look
at
a
kangaroo
in
the
zoological
gardens
for
kangaroos
come
from
australia
a
low
wall
separated
the
far
end
of
her
garden
from
the
meadow
outside
beyond
that
lay
the
stream
which
flowed
into
the
avon
and
it
often
seemed
wonderful
to
her
that
the
water
which
wimpled
by
would
unless
a
cow
happened
to
drink
it
soon
be
stealing
along
past
the
church
at
stratford
where
shakespeare
lay
peppino
had
written
a
very
moving
little
about
it
for
she
had
royally
presented
him
with
the
idea
and
had
suggested
a
beautiful
analogy
between
the
earthly
dew
that
refreshed
the
grasses
and
was
drawn
up
into
the
fire
of
the
sun
and
thought
the
spiritual
dew
that
refreshed
the
mind
and
thereafter
rather
vaguely
was
drawn
up
into
the
soul
of
the
world
at
that
moment
lucia
eye
was
attracted
by
an
apparition
on
the
road
which
lay
adjacent
to
the
further
side
of
the
happy
stream
which
flowed
into
the
avon
there
was
no
mistaking
the
identity
of
the
stout
figure
of
mrs
quantock
with
its
short
steps
and
its
gesticulations
but
why
in
the
name
of
wonder
should
that
christian
scientist
be
walking
with
the
draped
and
turbaned
figure
of
a
man
with
a
tropical
complexion
and
a
black
beard
his
robe
of
saffron
yellow
with
a
violently
green
girdle
was
hitched
up
for
ease
in
walking
and
unless
he
had
chocolate
coloured
stockings
on
mrs
lucas
saw
human
legs
of
the
same
shade
next
moment
that
debatable
point
was
set
at
rest
for
she
caught
sight
of
short
pink
socks
in
red
slippers
even
as
she
looked
mrs
quantock
saw
her
for
owing
to
christian
science
she
had
recaptured
the
quick
vision
of
youth
and
waggled
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
evidently
called
her
companion
attention
for
the
next
moment
he
was
salaaming
to
her
in
some
stately
oriental
manner
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
the
moment
except
return
these
salutations
as
she
could
not
yell
an
aside
to
mrs
quantock
screaming
out
who
is
that
indian
for
if
mrs
quantock
heard
the
indian
would
hear
too
but
as
soon
as
she
could
she
turned
back
towards
the
house
again
and
when
once
the
lilac
bushes
were
between
her
and
the
road
she
walked
with
more
than
her
usual
speed
in
order
to
learn
with
the
shortest
possible
delay
from
peppino
who
this
fresh
subject
of
hers
could
be
she
knew
there
were
some
indian
princes
in
london
perhaps
it
was
one
of
them
in
which
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
read
up
benares
or
delhi
in
the
encyclopaedia
without
loss
of
time
chapter
two
as
she
traversed
the
the
cheerful
sounds
that
had
once
tinkled
from
the
collar
of
a
flemish
horse
chimed
through
the
house
and
simultaneously
she
became
aware
that
there
would
be
au
for
lunch
which
was
very
dear
and
remembering
of
peppino
but
before
setting
fork
to
her
plate
she
had
to
question
him
for
her
mental
craving
for
information
was
far
keener
than
her
appetite
for
food
who
is
an
indian
she
said
whom
i
saw
just
now
with
daisy
quantock
they
were
the
other
side
of
il
piccolo
avon
peppino
had
already
begun
his
macaroni
and
must
pause
to
shovel
the
outlying
strings
of
it
into
his
mouth
but
the
haste
with
which
he
did
so
was
sufficient
guaranty
for
his
eagerness
to
reply
as
soon
as
it
was
humanly
possible
to
do
so
indian
my
dear
he
asked
with
the
greatest
interest
yes
turban
and
burnous
and
calves
and
slippers
she
said
rather
impatiently
for
what
was
the
good
of
peppino
having
remained
in
riseholme
if
he
could
not
give
her
precise
and
certain
information
on
local
news
when
she
returned
his
were
all
very
well
but
as
he
had
other
duties
of
state
which
must
not
be
neglected
for
the
calls
of
art
this
slight
asperity
on
her
part
seemed
to
sharpen
his
wits
really
i
do
know
for
certain
lucia
he
said
for
i
have
not
set
my
eyes
on
him
but
putting
two
and
two
together
i
might
make
a
guess
two
and
two
make
four
she
said
with
that
irony
for
which
she
was
feared
and
famous
now
for
your
guess
i
hope
it
is
equally
accurate
well
as
i
told
you
in
one
of
my
letters
said
he
mrs
quantock
showed
signs
of
being
a
little
off
with
christian
science
she
had
a
cold
and
though
she
recited
the
true
statement
of
being
just
as
frequently
as
before
her
cold
got
no
better
but
when
i
saw
her
on
tuesday
last
unless
it
was
wednesday
no
it
could
have
been
wednesday
so
it
must
have
been
tuesday
whenever
it
was
then
interrupted
his
wife
brilliantly
summing
up
his
indecision
yes
whenever
it
was
as
you
say
on
that
occasion
mrs
quantock
was
very
full
of
some
indian
philosophy
which
made
you
quite
well
at
once
what
did
she
call
it
now
yoga
yes
that
was
it
and
then
asked
lucia
well
it
appears
you
must
have
a
teacher
in
yoga
or
else
you
may
injure
yourself
you
have
to
breathe
deeply
and
say
say
what
om
i
understand
the
ejaculation
to
be
om
and
there
are
very
curious
physical
exercises
you
have
to
hold
your
ear
with
one
hand
and
your
toes
with
the
other
and
you
may
strain
yourself
unless
you
do
it
properly
that
was
the
general
gist
of
it
and
shall
we
come
to
the
indian
soon
said
lucia
you
have
come
to
him
already
i
suggest
that
mrs
quantock
has
applied
for
a
teacher
and
got
him
mrs
lucas
wore
a
heavily
corrugated
forehead
at
this
news
peppino
had
a
wonderful
in
explaining
unusual
circumstances
in
the
life
of
riseholme
and
his
conjectures
were
generally
correct
but
if
he
was
right
in
this
instance
it
struck
lucia
as
being
a
very
irregular
thing
that
anyone
should
have
imported
a
mystical
indian
into
riseholme
without
consulting
her
it
is
true
that
she
had
been
away
but
still
there
was
the
medium
of
the
post
indeed
she
said
it
puts
me
in
rather
a
difficult
position
for
i
must
send
out
my
invitations
to
my
today
and
i
really
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
be
officially
aware
of
this
man
existence
or
not
i
ca
write
to
daisy
quantock
and
say
bring
your
black
friend
om
or
whatever
his
name
proves
to
be
and
on
the
other
hand
if
he
is
the
sort
of
person
whom
one
would
be
sorry
to
miss
i
should
not
like
to
have
passed
over
him
after
all
my
dear
you
have
only
been
back
in
riseholme
half
an
hour
said
her
husband
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
mrs
quantock
to
have
told
you
yet
her
face
cleared
perhaps
daisy
has
written
to
me
about
him
she
said
i
may
find
a
full
account
of
it
all
when
i
open
my
letters
depend
upon
it
you
will
she
would
hardly
have
been
so
wanting
in
proper
feeling
as
not
to
have
told
you
i
think
too
that
her
visitor
must
only
have
just
arrived
or
i
should
have
been
sure
to
see
him
about
somewhere
she
rose
well
we
will
see
she
said
now
i
shall
be
very
busy
all
afternoon
but
by
i
shall
be
ready
to
see
anyone
who
calls
give
me
my
letters
and
i
will
find
out
if
daisy
has
written
to
me
she
turned
them
over
as
she
went
to
her
room
and
there
among
them
was
a
bulky
envelope
addressed
in
mrs
quantock
great
sprawling
hand
which
looked
at
first
sight
so
large
and
legible
but
on
closer
examination
turned
out
to
be
so
baffling
you
had
to
hold
it
at
some
distance
off
to
make
anything
out
of
it
and
look
at
it
in
an
abstracted
general
manner
much
as
you
would
look
at
a
view
treated
thus
scattered
words
began
to
leap
into
being
and
when
you
had
got
a
sufficiency
of
these
like
glimpses
of
the
country
seen
by
flashes
of
lightning
you
could
hope
to
get
a
collective
idea
of
it
all
the
procedure
led
to
the
most
promising
results
as
mrs
lucas
sat
with
the
sheets
at
arm
length
occasionally
altering
the
range
to
try
the
effect
of
a
different
focus
benares
blinked
at
her
also
brahmin
also
highest
caste
extraordinary
sanctity
and
guru
and
when
the
meaning
of
this
latter
was
ascertained
from
the
article
on
yoga
in
her
encyclopaedia
she
progressed
very
swiftly
towards
a
complete
comprehension
of
the
letter
when
fully
pieced
together
it
was
certainly
enough
to
rivet
her
whole
attention
and
make
her
leave
unopened
the
rest
of
the
correspondence
for
such
a
prelude
to
adventure
had
seldom
sounded
in
riseholme
it
appeared
even
as
her
husband
had
told
her
at
lunch
that
mrs
quantock
found
her
cold
too
obstinate
for
all
the
precepts
of
mrs
eddy
the
true
statement
of
being
however
often
repeated
only
seemed
to
inflame
it
further
and
one
day
when
confined
to
the
house
she
had
taken
a
book
quite
at
random
from
the
shelves
in
her
library
under
she
supposed
the
influence
of
some
interior
compulsion
this
then
was
clearly
a
leading
mrs
lucas
paused
a
moment
as
she
pieced
together
these
first
sentences
she
seemed
to
remember
that
mrs
quantock
had
experienced
a
similar
leading
when
first
she
took
up
christian
science
it
was
a
leading
from
the
sight
of
a
new
church
off
sloane
street
that
day
mrs
quantock
had
entered
she
scarcely
knew
why
and
had
found
herself
in
a
testimony
meeting
where
witness
after
witness
declared
the
miraculous
healings
they
had
experienced
one
had
had
a
cough
another
cancer
another
a
fractured
bone
but
all
had
been
cured
by
the
blessed
truths
conveyed
in
the
gospel
according
to
mrs
eddy
however
her
memories
on
this
subject
were
not
to
the
point
now
she
burned
to
arrive
at
the
story
of
the
new
leading
well
the
book
that
mrs
quantock
had
taken
down
in
obedience
to
the
last
leading
proved
to
be
a
little
handbook
of
oriental
philosophies
and
it
opened
all
of
its
own
accord
at
a
chapter
called
yoga
instantly
she
perceived
as
by
the
unclosing
of
an
inward
eye
that
yoga
was
what
she
wanted
and
she
instantly
wrote
to
the
address
from
which
this
book
was
issued
asking
for
any
guidance
on
the
subject
she
had
read
in
oriental
philosophies
that
for
the
successful
practice
of
yoga
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
teacher
and
did
they
know
of
any
teacher
who
could
give
her
instruction
a
wonderful
answer
came
to
that
for
two
days
afterwards
her
maid
came
to
her
and
said
that
an
indian
gentleman
would
like
to
see
her
he
was
ushered
in
and
with
a
profound
obeisance
said
beloved
lady
i
am
the
teacher
you
asked
for
i
am
your
guru
peace
be
to
this
house
om
mrs
lucas
had
by
this
time
got
her
view
of
mrs
quantock
letter
into
perfect
focus
and
she
read
on
without
missing
a
word
is
it
not
wonderful
dearest
lucia
it
ran
that
my
desire
for
light
should
have
been
so
instantly
answered
and
yet
my
guru
tells
me
that
it
always
happens
so
i
was
sent
to
him
and
he
was
sent
to
me
just
like
that
he
had
been
expecting
some
call
when
my
letter
asking
for
guidance
came
and
he
started
at
once
because
he
knew
he
was
sent
fancy
i
do
even
know
his
name
and
his
religion
forbids
him
to
tell
it
me
he
is
just
my
guru
my
guide
and
he
is
going
to
be
with
me
as
long
as
he
knows
i
need
him
to
show
me
the
true
path
he
has
the
spare
bedroom
and
the
little
room
adjoining
where
he
meditates
and
does
postures
and
pranyama
which
is
breathing
if
you
persevere
in
them
under
instruction
you
have
perfect
health
and
youth
and
my
cold
is
gone
already
he
is
a
brahmin
of
the
very
highest
caste
indeed
caste
means
nothing
to
him
any
longer
just
as
a
baronet
and
an
honourable
must
seem
about
the
same
thing
to
the
king
he
comes
from
benares
where
he
used
to
meditate
all
day
by
the
ganges
and
i
can
see
for
myself
that
he
is
a
person
of
the
most
extraordinary
sanctity
but
he
can
meditate
just
as
well
in
my
little
room
for
he
says
he
was
never
in
any
house
that
had
such
a
wonderful
atmosphere
he
has
no
money
at
all
which
is
so
beautiful
of
him
and
looked
so
pained
and
disappointed
when
i
asked
him
if
i
might
not
give
him
some
he
does
even
know
how
he
got
here
from
london
he
does
think
he
came
by
train
so
perhaps
he
was
wafted
here
in
some
astral
manner
he
looked
so
bewildered
too
when
i
said
the
word
and
evidently
he
had
to
think
what
it
was
because
it
is
so
long
since
it
has
meant
anything
to
him
so
if
he
wants
anything
i
have
told
him
to
go
into
any
shop
and
ask
that
it
shall
be
put
down
to
me
he
has
often
been
without
food
or
sleep
for
days
together
when
he
is
meditating
just
think
shall
i
bring
him
to
see
you
or
will
you
come
here
he
wants
to
meet
you
because
he
feels
you
have
a
beautiful
soul
and
may
help
him
in
that
way
as
well
as
his
helping
you
i
am
helping
him
too
he
says
which
seems
more
wonderful
than
i
can
believe
send
me
a
line
as
soon
as
you
get
back
your
own
daisy
the
voluminous
sheets
had
taken
long
in
reading
and
mrs
lucas
folded
them
up
slowly
and
thoughtfully
she
felt
that
she
had
to
make
a
swift
decision
that
called
into
play
all
her
mental
powers
on
the
one
hand
it
was
up
to
her
to
return
a
frigid
reply
conveying
without
making
any
bones
about
the
matter
that
she
had
no
interest
in
nameless
gurus
who
might
or
might
not
be
brahmins
from
benares
and
presented
themselves
at
daisy
doors
in
a
penniless
condition
without
clear
knowledge
whether
they
had
come
by
train
or
not
in
favour
of
such
prudent
measures
was
the
truly
athenian
character
of
daisy
mind
for
she
was
always
enquiring
into
some
new
thing
which
was
the
secret
of
life
when
first
discovered
and
got
speedily
relegated
to
the
but
against
such
a
course
was
the
undoubted
fact
that
daisy
did
occasionally
get
hold
of
somebody
who
subsequently
proved
to
be
of
interest
and
lucia
would
never
forget
to
her
dying
day
the
advent
in
riseholme
of
a
little
welsh
attorney
in
whom
daisy
had
discovered
a
wonderful
mentality
lucia
had
refused
to
extend
her
queenly
hospitality
to
him
or
to
recognise
his
existence
in
any
way
during
the
fortnight
when
he
stayed
with
daisy
and
she
was
naturally
very
much
annoyed
to
find
him
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
government
not
many
years
later
indeed
she
had
snubbed
him
so
markedly
on
his
first
appearance
at
riseholme
that
he
had
refused
on
subsequent
visits
to
come
to
her
house
at
all
though
he
several
times
visited
mrs
quantock
again
and
told
her
all
sorts
of
political
secrets
so
she
said
which
she
would
not
divulge
for
anything
in
the
world
there
must
never
be
a
repetition
of
so
fatal
an
error
another
thing
inclined
the
wavering
balance
she
distinctly
wanted
some
fresh
element
at
her
court
that
should
make
riseholme
know
that
she
was
in
residence
again
august
would
soon
be
here
with
its
languors
and
absence
of
stimulus
when
it
was
really
rather
difficult
in
the
drowsy
windless
weather
to
keep
the
flag
of
culture
flying
strongly
from
her
own
palace
the
guru
had
already
said
that
he
felt
sure
she
had
a
beautiful
soul
and
the
outline
of
the
scheme
flashed
upon
her
she
would
have
yoga
evenings
in
the
hot
august
weather
at
which
as
the
heat
of
the
day
abated
graceful
groups
should
assemble
among
the
mottos
in
the
garden
and
listen
to
high
talk
on
spiritual
subjects
they
would
adjourn
to
delicious
moonlit
suppers
in
the
pergola
or
if
the
moon
was
indisposed
she
could
not
be
expected
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
the
moon
as
well
as
of
riseholme
there
would
be
dim
seances
and
sandwiches
in
the
the
humorous
furniture
should
be
put
in
cupboards
and
as
they
drifted
towards
the
front
hall
again
when
the
clocks
struck
an
unexpectedly
late
hour
little
whispered
colloquies
of
how
wonderful
he
was
tonight
would
be
heard
and
there
would
be
faraway
looks
and
sighs
and
the
notings
down
of
the
titles
of
books
that
conducted
the
pilgrim
on
the
way
perhaps
as
they
softly
assembled
for
departure
a
little
music
would
be
suggested
to
round
off
the
evening
and
she
saw
herself
putting
down
the
soft
pedal
as
people
rustled
into
their
places
for
the
first
movement
of
the
moonlight
sonata
then
at
the
end
there
would
be
silence
and
she
would
get
up
with
a
sigh
and
someone
would
say
lucia
mia
and
somebody
else
heavenly
music
and
perhaps
the
guru
would
say
beloved
lady
as
he
had
said
to
poor
daisy
quantock
flowers
music
addresses
from
the
guru
soft
partings
sense
of
refreshment
with
the
memory
of
the
welsh
attorney
in
her
mind
it
seemed
clearly
wiser
to
annex
rather
than
to
repudiate
the
guru
she
seized
a
pen
and
drew
a
pile
of
postcards
towards
her
on
the
top
of
which
was
printed
her
name
and
address
too
wonderful
she

pray
bring
him
yourself
to
my
little
on
friday
there
will
be
only
a
few
let
me
know
if
he
wants
a
quiet
room
ready
for
him
all
this
had
taken
time
and
she
had
but
scribbled
a
dozen
postcards
to
friends
bidding
them
come
to
her
garden
party
on
friday
when
tea
was
announced
these
invitations
had
the
mystic
word
hightum
written
at
the
bottom
left
hand
corner
which
conveyed
to
the
enlightened
recipient
what
sort
of
party
it
was
to
be
and
denoted
the
standard
of
dress
for
one
of
lucia
quaint
ideas
was
to
divide
dresses
into
three
classes
hightum
tightum
and
scrub
hightum
was
your
very
best
dress
the
smartest
and
newest
of
all
and
when
hightum
was
written
on
a
card
of
invitation
it
implied
that
the
party
was
a
very
resplendent
one
tightum
similarly
indicated
a
moderately
smart
party
scrub
carried
its
own
significance
on
the
surface
these
terms
applied
to
men
dress
as
well
and
as
regards
evening
parties
a
dinner
party
hightum
would
indicate
a
white
tie
and
a
tail
coat
a
dinner
party
tightum
a
black
tie
and
a
short
coat
and
a
dinner
scrub
would
mean
morning
clothes
with
tea
was
announced
also
the
advent
of
georgie
pillson
who
was
her
when
she
was
at
home
and
her
when
she
was
not
in
order
to
save
subsequent
disappointment
it
may
be
at
once
stated
that
there
never
has
been
was
or
ever
would
be
the
smallest
approach
to
a
flirtation
between
them
neither
of
them
she
with
her
forty
respectable
years
and
he
with
his
blameless
years
had
ever
flirted
with
anybody
at
all
but
it
was
one
of
the
polite
and
pleasant
fictions
of
riseholme
that
georgie
was
passionately
attached
to
her
and
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
settled
in
riseholme
now
some
seven
years
ago
and
that
for
her
sake
he
remained
still
unmarried
she
never
to
do
her
justice
had
affirmed
anything
of
the
sort
but
it
is
a
fact
that
sometimes
when
georgie
name
came
up
in
conversation
her
eyes
wore
that
look
that
only
the
masterpieces
of
art
could
otherwise
call
up
and
she
would
sigh
and
murmur
dear
georgie
and
change
the
subject
with
the
tact
that
characterized
her
in
fact
their
mutual
relations
were
among
the
most
beautiful
things
of
riseholme
and
hardly
less
beautiful
was
attitude
towards
it
all
that
large
hearted
man
trusted
them
both
and
his
trust
was
perfectly
justified
georgie
was
in
and
out
of
the
house
all
day
chiefly
in
and
not
only
did
scandal
never
rear
its
hissing
head
but
it
positively
had
not
a
head
to
hiss
with
or
a
foot
to
stand
on
on
his
side
again
georgie
had
never
said
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
nor
would
it
have
been
true
if
he
had
but
by
his
complete
silence
on
the
subject
coupled
with
his
constancy
he
seemed
to
admit
the
truth
of
this
bloodless
idyll
they
talked
and
walked
and
read
the
masterpieces
of
literature
and
played
duets
on
the
piano
together
sometimes
for
he
was
the
more
brilliant
performer
though
as
he
said
terribly
lazy
about
practising
for
which
she
scolded
him
he
would
gently
slap
the
back
of
her
hand
if
she
played
a
wrong
note
and
say
naughty
and
she
would
reply
in
baby
language
me
vewy
sowwy
oo
naughty
too
to
hurt
lucia
that
was
the
utmost
extent
of
their
carnal
familiarities
and
with
bright
eyes
fixed
on
the
music
they
would
break
into
peals
of
girlish
laughter
until
the
beauty
of
the
music
sobered
them
again
georgie
he
was
georgie
or
mr
georgie
never
pillson
to
the
whole
of
riseholme
was
not
an
obtrusively
masculine
sort
of
person
such
masculinity
as
he
was
possessed
of
was
boyish
rather
than
adult
and
the
most
important
ingredients
in
his
nature
were
womanish
he
had
in
common
with
the
rest
of
riseholme
strong
artistic
tastes
and
in
addition
to
playing
the
piano
made
charming
little
sketches
many
of
which
he
framed
at
his
own
expense
and
gave
to
friends
with
slightly
sentimental
titles
neatly
printed
in
gilt
letters
on
the
mount
golden
autumn
woodland
bleak
december
yellow
daffodils
roses
of
summer
were
perhaps
his
most
notable
series
and
these
he
had
given
to
lucia
on
the
occasion
of
four
successive
birthdays
he
did
portraits
as
well
in
pastel
these
were
of
two
types
elderly
ladies
in
lace
caps
with
a
row
of
pearls
and
boys
in
cricket
shirts
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
he
was
not
very
good
at
eyes
so
his
sitters
always
were
looking
down
but
he
was
excellent
at
smiles
and
the
old
ladies
smiled
patiently
and
sweetly
and
the
boys
gaily
but
his
finest
accomplishment
was
needlework
and
his
house
was
full
of
the
creations
of
his
needle
curtains
chair
seats
and
silk
embroideries
framed
and
glazed
next
to
lucia
he
was
the
hardest
worked
inhabitant
of
riseholme
but
not
being
so
strong
as
the
queen
he
had
often
to
go
away
for
little
rests
by
the
travelling
by
train
fussed
him
a
good
deal
for
he
might
not
be
able
to
get
a
corner
seat
or
somebody
with
a
pipe
or
a
baby
might
get
into
his
carriage
or
the
porter
might
be
rough
with
his
luggage
so
he
always
went
in
his
car
to
some
neighbouring
where
they
knew
him
dicky
his
handsome
young
chauffeur
drove
him
and
by
side
sat
foljambe
his
very
pretty
who
valetted
him
if
dicky
took
the
wrong
turn
his
master
called
naughty
boy
through
the
tube
and
foljambe
smiled
respectfully
for
the
month
of
august
his
two
plain
strapping
sisters
hermione
and
ursula
alas
always
came
to
stay
with
him
they
liked
pigs
and
dogs
and
and
and
were
rather
a
discordant
element
in
riseholme
but
georgie
had
a
kind
heart
and
never
even
debated
whether
he
should
ask
hermy
and
ursy
or
not
though
he
had
to
do
a
great
deal
of
tidying
up
after
they
had
gone
there
was
always
a
playful
touch
between
the
meetings
of
these
two
when
either
of
them
had
been
away
from
riseholme
that
very
prettily
concealed
the
depth
of
georgie
supposed
devotion
and
when
she
came
out
into
the
garden
where
her
cavalier
and
her
husband
were
waiting
for
their
tea
under
the
pergola
georgie
jumped
up
very
nimbly
and
took
a
few
steps
towards
her
with
both
hands
outstretched
in
welcome
she
caught
at
his
humour
made
him
a
curtsey
and
next
moment
they
were
treading
a
little
improvised
minuet
together
with
hands
held
high
and
pointed
toes
georgie
had
very
small
feet
and
it
was
a
really
elegant
toe
that
he
pointed
encased
in
boots
he
had
on
a
suit
of
fresh
white
flannels
and
over
his
shoulders
for
fear
of
the
evening
air
being
chilly
after
this
hot
day
he
had
a
little
cape
of
a
military
cut
like
those
in
which
young
ladies
at
enact
the
part
of
colonels
he
had
a
on
with
a
blue
riband
a
pink
shirt
and
a
red
tie
rather
loose
and
billowy
his
face
was
pink
and
round
with
blue
eyes
a
short
nose
and
very
red
lips
an
almost
complete
absence
of
eyebrow
was
made
up
for
by
a
firm
little
brown
moustache
clipped
very
short
and
brushed
upwards
at
its
extremities
contrary
to
expectation
he
was
quite
tall
and
fitted
very
neatly
into
his
clothes
the
dance
came
to
an
end
with
a
low
curtsey
on
lucia
part
an
obeisance
hat
in
hand
from
georgie
this
exposure
shewing
a
crop
of
hair
grown
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
brushed
smoothly
over
the
top
until
it
joined
the
hair
on
the
other
side
and
a
clapping
of
the
hands
from
peppino
bravo
bravo
he
cried
from
the
capital
mrs
lucas
blew
him
a
kiss
in
acknowledgment
of
this
compliment
and
smiled
on
her
partner
she
said
it
is
nice
to
see
you
again
how
goes
it
said
georgie
to
show
he
could
talk
italian
too
very
now
that
you
come
back
now
tell
us
all
the
news
we
have
a
good
gossip
georgie
face
beamed
with
a
solemn
gladness
at
the
word
like
a
drunkard
when
brandy
is
mentioned
where
shall
we
begin
he
said
such
a
lot
to
tell
you
i
think
we
must
begin
with
a
great
bit
of
news
something
really
mysterious
lucia
smiled
inwardly
she
felt
that
she
knew
for
dead
certain
what
the
mysterious
news
was
and
also
that
she
knew
far
more
about
it
than
georgie
this
superiority
she
completely
concealed
nobody
could
have
guessed
it
presto
she
said
you
excite
me
yesterday
morning
i
was
in
rush
said
georgie
seeing
about
some
de
which
ought
to
have
been
sent
the
day
before
rush
is
very
negligent
sometimes
and
i
was
just
saying
a
sharp
word
about
it
when
suddenly
i
saw
that
rush
was
not
attending
at
all
but
was
looking
at
something
behind
my
back
and
so
i
looked
round
guess
do
be
tantalising
said
she
how
can
i
guess
a
pink
elephant
with
blue
spots
no
guess
again
a
red
indian
in
full
war
paint
certainly
not
guess
again
said
georgie
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
it
would
have
been
awful
if
she
had
guessed
at
this
moment
peppino
suddenly
became
aware
that
lucia
had
guessed
and
was
up
to
some
game
give
me
your
hand
georgie
she
said
and
look
at
me
i
going
to
read
your
thoughts
think
of
what
you
saw
when
you
turned
round
she
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
forehead
closing
her
eyes
but
i
do
seem
to
see
an
indian
she
said
ah
not
red
indian
other
indian
and
and
he
has
slippers
on
and
brown
stockings
no
not
brown
stockings
it
legs
and
there
a
beard
and
a
turban
she
gave
a
sigh
that
all
i
can
see
she
said
my
dear
you
marvellous
said
he
you
quite
right
a
slight
bubbling
sound
came
from
peppino
and
georgie
began
to
suspect
i
believe
you
seen
him
he
said
how
tarsome
you
are
when
they
had
all
laughed
a
great
deal
and
georgie
had
been
assured
that
lucia
really
word
of
honour
had
no
idea
what
happened
next
the
narrative
was
resumed
so
there
stood
the
indian
bowing
and
salaaming
most
politely
and
when
rush
had
promised
me
he
would
send
my
de
that
very
morning
i
just
looked
through
a
wine
list
for
a
moment
and
the
indian
with
quantities
more
bows
came
up
to
the
counter
and
said
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
give
me
a
little
brandy
bottle
so
rush
gave
it
him
and
instead
of
paying
for
it
what
do
you
think
he
said
guess
mrs
lucas
rose
with
the
air
of
lady
macbeth
and
pointed
her
finger
at
georgie
he
said
it
down
to
mrs
quantock
account
she
hissed
of
course
the
explanation
came
now
and
lucia
told
the
two
men
the
contents
of
mrs
quantock
letter
with
that
her
cards
were
on
the
table
and
though
the
fact
of
the
brahmin
from
benares
was
news
to
georgie
he
had
got
many
interesting
things
to
tell
her
for
his
house
adjoined
mrs
quantock
and
there
were
plenty
of
things
which
mrs
quantock
had
not
mentioned
in
her
letter
so
that
georgie
was
soon
in
the
position
of
informant
again
his
windows
overlooked
mrs
garden
and
since
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
shut
all
day
it
followed
that
the
happenings
there
were
quite
common
property
indeed
that
was
a
general
rule
in
riseholme
anyone
in
an
adjoining
property
could
say
what
an
exciting
game
of
you
had
this
afternoon
having
followed
it
from
his
bedroom
that
was
part
of
the
charm
of
riseholme
it
was
as
if
it
contained
just
one
happy
family
with
common
interests
and
pursuits
what
happened
in
the
house
was
a
more
private
matter
and
mrs
quantock
for
instance
would
never
look
from
the
rising
ground
at
the
end
of
her
garden
into
georgie
or
if
she
did
she
would
never
tell
anyone
how
many
places
were
laid
at
table
on
that
particular
day
when
she
had
asked
if
he
could
give
her
lunch
and
he
had
replied
that
to
his
great
regret
his
table
was
full
but
nobody
could
help
seeing
into
gardens
from
back
windows
the
view
belonged
to
everybody
georgie
had
had
wonderful
views
that
very
day
he
said
soon
after
lunch
i
was
looking
for
a
letter
i
thought
i
had
left
in
my
bedroom
and
happening
to
glance
out
i
saw
the
indian
sitting
under
mrs
quantock
he
was
swaying
a
little
backwards
and
forwards
the
brandy
said
lucia
excitedly
he
has
his
meals
in
his
own
room
no
it
was
not
the
brandy
in
fact
i
do
suppose
the
brandy
had
gone
to
mrs
quantock
then
for
he
did
not
take
it
from
rush
but
asked
that
it
should
be
sent
he
paused
a
moment
or
did
he
take
it
away
i
declare
i
ca
remember
but
anyhow
when
he
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
he
was
drunk
for
presently
he
stood
on
one
leg
and
crooked
the
other
behind
it
and
remained
there
with
his
hands
up
as
if
he
was
praying
for
quite
a
long
time
without
swaying
at
all
so
he
could
have
been
tipsy
and
then
he
sat
down
again
and
took
off
his
slippers
and
held
his
toes
with
one
hand
while
his
legs
were
quite
straight
out
and
put
his
other
hand
round
behind
his
head
and
grasped
his
other
ear
with
it
i
tried
to
do
it
on
my
bedroom
floor
but
i
could
get
near
it
then
he
sat
up
again
and
called
chela
and
mrs
quantock
came
running
out
why
did
he
say
asked
lucia
i
wondered
too
but
i
knew
i
had
some
clue
to
it
so
i
looked
through
some
books
by
rudyard
kipling
and
found
that
chela
meant
what
you
have
told
me
just
now
about
being
seems
to
piece
the
whole
thing
together
and
what
did
daisy
do
asked
mrs
lucas
breathlessly
she
sat
down
too
and
put
her
legs
out
straight
in
front
of
her
like
the
guru
and
tried
to
hold
the
toe
of
her
shoe
in
her
fingers
and
naturally
she
could
get
within
yards
of
it
i
got
nearer
than
she
did
and
he
said
lady
not
too
far
at
first
so
you
could
hear
too
said
lucia
naturally
for
my
window
was
open
and
as
you
know
mrs
is
quite
close
to
the
house
and
then
he
told
her
to
stop
up
one
nostril
with
her
finger
and
inhale
through
the
other
and
then
hold
her
breath
while
he
counted
six
then
she
breathed
it
all
out
again
and
started
with
the
other
side
she
repeated
that
several
times
and
he
was
very
much
pleased
with
her
then
she
said
is
quite
wonderful
i
feel
so
light
and
vigorous
it
would
be
very
wonderful
indeed
if
dear
daisy
felt
light
remarked
lucia
what
next
then
they
sat
and
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
again
and
muttered
something
that
sounded
like
pom
that
would
be
and
then
i
could
wait
any
longer
for
i
had
some
letters
to
write
she
smiled
at
him
i
shall
give
you
another
cup
of
tea
to
reward
you
for
your
report
she
said
it
has
all
been
most
interesting
tell
me
again
about
the
breathing
in
and
holding
your
breath
georgie
did
so
and
illustrated
in
his
own
person
what
had
happened
next
moment
lucia
was
imitating
him
and
peppino
came
round
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
what
georgie
was
doing
then
they
all
sat
inhaling
through
one
nostril
holding
their
breath
and
then
expelling
it
again
very
interesting
said
lucia
at
the
end
upon
my
word
it
does
give
one
a
sort
of
feeling
of
vigour
and
lightness
i
wonder
if
there
is
something
in
it
chapter
three
though
the
hurst
was
as
befitted
its
chatelaine
the
most
elizabethanly
complete
abode
in
riseholme
the
rest
of
the
village
in
its
due
degree
fell
very
little
short
of
perfection
it
had
but
its
one
street
some
half
mile
in
length
but
that
street
was
a
gem
of
mediaeval
domestic
architecture
for
the
most
part
the
houses
that
lined
it
were
blocks
of
contiguous
cottages
which
had
been
converted
either
singly
or
by
twos
and
threes
into
dwellings
containing
the
comforts
demanded
by
the
twentieth
century
but
externally
they
preserved
the
antiquity
which
though
it
might
be
restored
or
supplemented
by
bathrooms
or
other
conveniences
presented
a
truly
elizabethan
appearance
there
were
of
course
accretions
such
as
old
inn
signs
above
and
old
at
their
sides
but
the
doors
were
uniformly
of
inconveniently
low
stature
roofs
were
of
stone
slabs
or
old
brick
in
which
a
suspiciously
abundant
crop
of
antirrhinums
and
stone
crops
had
anchored
themselves
and
there
was
hardly
a
garden
that
did
not
contain
a
path
of
old
a
and
some
yews
cut
into
shape
nothing
in
the
place
was
more
blatantly
mediaeval
than
the
village
green
across
which
georgie
took
his
tripping
steps
after
leaving
the
presence
of
his
queen
round
it
stood
a
row
of
great
elms
and
in
its
centre
was
the
according
to
riseholme
tradition
though
perhaps
in
less
classical
villages
it
might
have
passed
merely
for
a
but
in
riseholme
it
would
have
been
rank
heresy
to
dream
even
in
the
most
pessimistic
moments
of
its
being
anything
but
a
close
by
it
stood
a
pair
of
stocks
about
which
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
for
mr
lucas
had
purchased
them
from
a
neighbouring
iconoclastic
village
where
they
were
going
to
be
broken
up
and
after
having
them
repaired
had
presented
them
to
the
and
chosen
their
site
close
to
the
ducking
pond
round
the
green
were
grouped
the
shops
of
the
village
slightly
apart
from
the
residential
street
and
at
the
far
end
of
it
was
that
undoubtedly
elizabethan
hostelry
the
ambermere
arms
full
to
overflowing
of
ancient
tables
and
and
and
and
bottles
and
chests
and
settles
these
were
purchased
in
large
quantities
by
the
american
tourists
who
swarmed
there
during
the
summer
months
at
a
high
profit
to
the
nimble
proprietor
who
thereupon
purchased
fresh
antiquities
to
take
their
places
the
ambermere
arms
in
fact
was
the
antique
furniture
shop
of
the
place
and
did
a
thriving
trade
for
it
was
much
more
interesting
to
buy
objects
out
of
a
real
old
elizabethan
inn
than
out
of
a
shop
georgie
had
put
his
smart
military
cape
over
his
arm
for
his
walk
and
at
intervals
applied
his
slim
forefinger
to
one
nostril
while
he
breathed
in
through
the
other
continuing
the
practice
which
he
had
observed
going
on
in
mrs
quantock
garden
though
it
made
him
a
little
dizzy
it
certainly
produced
a
sort
of
lightness
but
soon
he
remembered
the
letter
from
mrs
quantock
which
lucia
had
read
out
warning
her
that
these
exercises
ought
to
be
taken
under
instruction
and
so
desisted
he
was
going
to
deliver
lucia
answer
at
mrs
quantock
house
and
with
a
view
to
possibly
meeting
the
guru
and
being
introduced
to
him
he
said
over
to
himself
guru
guru
guru
instead
of
doing
deep
breathing
in
order
to
accustom
himself
to
the
unusual
syllables
it
would
of
course
have
been
very
strange
and
to
have
gone
to
a
friend
door
even
though
the
errand
was
so
impersonal
a
one
as
bearing
somebody
else
note
without
enquiring
whether
the
friend
was
in
and
being
instantly
admitted
if
she
was
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
georgie
caught
a
glimpse
when
the
knocker
was
answered
mrs
quantock
did
not
have
a
bell
at
all
through
the
open
door
of
the
hall
of
mrs
quantock
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
on
one
leg
naturally
therefore
he
ran
out
into
the
garden
without
any
further
formality
she
looked
like
a
little
round
fat
stork
whose
legs
had
not
grown
but
who
preserved
the
habits
of
her
kind
dear
lady
i
brought
a
note
for
you
he
said
it
from
lucia
the
other
leg
went
down
and
she
turned
on
him
the
wide
firm
smile
that
she
had
learned
in
the
vanished
days
of
christian
science
om
said
mrs
quantock
expelling
the
remainder
of
her
breath
thank
you
my
dear
georgie
it
extraordinary
what
yoga
has
done
for
me
already
cold
quite
gone
if
ever
you
feel
out
of
sorts
or
depressed
or
cross
you
can
cure
yourself
at
once
i
got
a
visitor
staying
with
me
have
you
indeed
asked
georgie
without
alluding
to
the
thrilling
excitements
which
had
trodden
so
close
on
each
other
heels
since
yesterday
morning
when
he
had
seen
the
guru
in
rush
shop
yes
and
as
you
just
come
from
dear
lucia
perhaps
she
may
have
said
something
to
you
about
him
for
i
wrote
to
her
about
him
he
a
guru
of
extraordinary
sanctity
from
benares
and
he
teaching
me
the
way
you
shall
see
him
too
unless
he
meditating
i
will
call
to
him
if
he
meditating
he
wo
hear
me
so
we
sha
be
interrupting
him
he
would
hear
a
railway
accident
if
he
was
meditating
she
turned
round
towards
the
house
guru
dear
she
called
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
the
indian
face
appeared
at
a
window
beloved
lady
he
said
guru
dear
i
want
to
introduce
a
friend
of
mine
to
you
she
said
this
is
mr
pillson
and
when
you
know
him
a
little
better
you
will
call
him
georgie
beloved
lady
i
know
him
very
well
indeed
i
see
into
his
clear
white
soul
peace
be
unto
you
my
friend
is
he
marvellous
fancy
said
mrs
quantock
in
an
aside
georgie
raised
his
hat
very
politely
how
do
you
do
he
said
after
his
quiet
practice
he
would
have
said
how
do
you
do
guru
but
it
rhymed
in
a
ridiculous
manner
and
his
red
lips
could
not
frame
the
word
i
am
always
well
said
the
guru
i
am
always
young
and
well
because
i
follow
the
way
sixty
at
least
he
tells
me
said
mrs
quantock
in
a
hissing
aside
probably
audible
across
the
channel
and
he
thinks
more
but
the
years
make
no
difference
to
him
he
is
like
a
boy
call
him
guru
began
georgie
yes
my
friend
i
am
very
glad
you
are
well
said
georgie
wildly
he
was
greatly
impressed
but
much
embarrassed
also
it
was
so
hard
to
talk
at
a
window
with
any
sense
of
ease
especially
when
you
had
to
address
a
total
stranger
of
extraordinary
sanctity
from
benares
luckily
mrs
quantock
came
to
the
assistance
of
his
embarrassment
guru
dear
are
you
coming
down
to
see
us
she
asked
beloved
lady
no
said
the
level
voice
it
is
laid
on
me
to
wait
here
it
is
the
time
of
calm
and
prayer
when
it
is
good
to
be
alone
i
will
come
down
when
the
guides
bid
me
but
teach
our
dear
friend
what
i
have
taught
you
surely
before
long
i
will
grasp
his
earthly
hand
but
not
now
peace
peace
and
light
have
you
got
some
guides
as
well
asked
georgie
when
the
guru
disappeared
from
the
window
and
are
they
indians
too
oh
those
are
his
spiritual
guides
said
mrs
quantock
he
sees
them
and
talks
to
them
but
they
are
not
in
the
body
she
gave
a
happy
sigh
i
never
have
felt
anything
like
it
she
said
he
has
brought
such
an
atmosphere
into
the
house
that
even
robert
feels
it
and
does
mind
being
turned
out
of
his
there
he
has
shut
the
window
is
it
all
marvellous
georgie
had
not
seen
anything
particularly
marvellous
yet
except
the
phenomenon
of
mrs
quantock
standing
on
one
leg
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
but
presumably
her
emotion
communicated
itself
to
him
by
the
subtle
infection
of
the
spirit
and
what
does
he
do
he
asked
my
dear
it
is
not
what
he
does
but
what
he
is
said
she
why
even
my
little
bald
account
of
him
to
lucia
has
made
her
ask
him
to
her
of
course
i
ca
tell
whether
he
will
go
or
not
he
seems
so
very
much
how
shall
i
say
it
so
very
much
sent
to
me
but
i
shall
of
course
ask
him
whether
he
will
consent
trances
and
meditation
all
day
and
in
the
intervals
such
serenity
and
sweetness
you
know
for
instance
how
tiresome
robert
is
about
his
food
well
last
night
the
mutton
i
am
bound
to
say
was
a
little
underdone
and
robert
was
beginning
to
throw
it
about
his
plate
in
the
way
he
has
well
my
guru
got
up
and
just
said
me
the
way
to
kitchen
he
leaves
out
little
words
sometimes
because
they
do
matter
and
i
took
him
down
and
he
said
he
told
me
to
leave
him
there
and
in
ten
minutes
he
was
up
again
with
a
little
plate
of
curry
and
rice
and
what
had
been
underdone
mutton
and
you
never
ate
anything
so
good
robert
had
most
of
it
and
i
had
the
rest
and
my
guru
was
so
pleased
at
seeing
robert
pleased
he
said
robert
had
a
pure
white
soul
just
like
you
only
i
was
to
tell
him
because
for
him
the
way
ordained
that
he
must
find
it
out
for
himself
and
today
before
lunch
again
the
guru
went
down
in
the
kitchen
and
my
cook
told
me
he
only
took
a
pinch
of
pepper
and
a
tomato
and
a
little
bit
of
mutton
fat
and
a
sardine
and
a
bit
of
cheese
and
he
brought
up
a
dish
that
you
never
saw
equalled
delicious
i
should
a
bit
wonder
if
robert
began
soon
there
is
one
that
makes
you
lean
and
young
and
exercises
the
liver
this
sounded
very
entrancing
ca
you
teach
me
that
asked
georgie
eagerly
he
had
been
rather
distressed
about
his
increasing
plumpness
for
a
year
past
and
about
his
increasing
age
for
longer
than
that
as
for
his
liver
he
always
had
to
be
careful
she
shook
her
head
you
can
not
practise
it
except
under
tuition
from
an
expert
she
said
georgie
rapidly
considered
what
hermy
and
ursy
comments
would
be
if
when
they
arrived
tomorrow
he
was
found
doing
exercises
under
the
tuition
of
a
guru
hermy
when
she
was
not
could
be
very
sarcastic
and
he
had
a
clear
month
of
hermy
in
front
of
him
without
any
which
so
she
had
informed
him
was
not
possible
in
august
this
was
mysterious
to
georgie
because
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
all
otters
died
in
august
and
a
fresh
brood
came
in
like
caterpillars
if
hermy
was
here
in
october
she
would
all
morning
and
snore
all
afternoon
and
be
in
the
best
of
tempers
but
the
august
visit
required
more
careful
steering
yet
the
prospect
of
being
lean
and
young
and
internally
untroubled
was
wonderfully
tempting
but
could
he
be
my
guru
as
well
he
asked
quite
suddenly
and
by
some
demoniac
possession
a
desire
that
had
been
only
intermittently
present
in
mrs
quantock
consciousness
took
full
possession
of
her
a
red
revolutionary
insurgence
hoisted
its
banner
why
with
this
stupendous
novelty
in
the
shape
of
a
guru
should
she
lead
and
direct
riseholme
instead
of
lucia
she
had
long
wondered
why
darling
lucia
should
be
queen
of
riseholme
and
had
by
momentary
illumination
seen
herself
thus
equipped
as
far
more
capable
of
exercising
supremacy
after
all
everybody
in
riseholme
knew
old
tune
by
now
and
was
in
his
secret
consciousness
quite
aware
that
she
did
not
play
the
second
and
third
movements
of
the
moonlight
sonata
simply
because
they
went
faster
however
much
she
might
cloak
the
omission
by
saying
that
they
resembled
eleven
in
the
morning
and
and
mrs
quantock
had
often
suspected
that
she
did
not
read
one
quarter
of
the
books
she
talked
about
and
that
she
got
up
subjects
in
the
encyclopaedia
in
order
to
make
a
brave
show
that
covered
essential
ignorance
certainly
she
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
over
entertaining
but
robert
had
lately
made
twenty
times
daily
what
lucia
spent
annually
over
roumanian
oils
as
for
her
acting
had
she
not
completely
forgotten
her
words
as
lady
macbeth
in
the
middle
of
the
scene
but
here
was
lucia
as
proved
by
her
note
and
her
georgie
wildly
interested
in
the
guru
mrs
quantock
conjectured
that
plan
was
to
launch
the
guru
at
her
august
parties
as
her
own
discovery
he
would
be
a
novelty
and
it
would
be
lucia
who
gave
and
and
parties
while
she
herself
daisy
quantock
would
be
bidden
to
these
as
a
humble
guest
and
lucia
would
get
all
the
credit
and
as
likely
as
not
invite
the
discoverer
the
inventress
just
now
and
then
mrs
quantock
guru
would
become
lucia
guru
and
all
riseholme
would
flock
hungrily
for
light
and
leading
to
the
hurst
she
had
written
to
lucia
in
all
sincerity
hoping
that
she
would
extend
the
hospitality
of
her
to
the
guru
but
now
the
very
warmth
of
lucia
reply
caused
her
to
suspect
this
ulterior
motive
she
had
been
too
precipitate
too
rash
too
too
sudden
as
lucia
would
say
she
ought
to
have
known
that
lucia
with
her
august
parties
coming
on
would
have
jumped
at
a
guru
and
withheld
him
for
her
own
parties
taking
the
wind
out
of
lucia
august
sails
lucia
had
already
suborned
georgie
to
leave
this
note
and
begin
to
filch
the
guru
away
mrs
quantock
saw
it
all
now
and
clearly
this
was
not
to
be
borne
before
she
answered
she
steeled
herself
with
the
triumph
she
had
once
scored
in
the
matter
of
the
welsh
attorney
dear
georgie
she
said
no
one
would
be
more
delighted
than
i
if
my
guru
consented
to
take
you
as
a
pupil
but
you
ca
tell
what
he
will
do
as
he
said
to
me
today
apropos
of
myself
can
not
come
unless
i
sent
was
not
that
wonderful
he
knew
at
once
he
had
been
sent
to
me
by
this
time
georgie
was
quite
determined
to
have
the
guru
the
measure
of
his
determination
may
be
gauged
from
the
fact
that
he
forgot
all
about
lucia
but
he
called
me
his
friend
he
said
he
told
me
i
had
a
clean
white
soul
yes
but
that
is
his
attitude
towards
everybody
said
mrs
quantock
his
religion
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
think
ill
of
anybody
but
he
did
say
that
to
rush
cried
georgie
when
he
asked
for
some
brandy
to
be
put
down
to
you
mrs
quantock
expression
changed
for
a
moment
but
that
moment
was
too
short
for
georgie
to
notice
it
her
face
instantly
cleared
again
naturally
he
can
not
go
about
saying
that
sort
of
thing
she
observed
common
people
he
is
of
the
highest
caste
would
not
understand
him
georgie
made
the
direct
appeal
please
ask
him
to
teach
me
he
said
for
a
moment
mrs
quantock
did
not
answer
but
cocked
her
head
sideways
in
the
direction
of
the
where
a
thrush
was
singing
it
fluted
a
couple
of
repeated
phrases
and
then
was
silent
again
mrs
quantock
gave
a
great
smile
to
the
thank
you
little
brother
she
said
she
turned
to
georgie
again
that
comes
out
of
francis
she
said
but
yoga
embraces
all
that
is
true
in
every
religion
well
i
will
ask
my
guru
whether
he
will
take
you
as
a
pupil
but
i
ca
answer
for
what
he
will
say
what
does
he
what
does
he
charge
for
his
lesson
asked
georgie
the
christian
science
smile
illuminated
her
face
again
the
word
never
passes
his
lips
she
said
i
do
think
he
really
knows
what
it
means
he
proposed
to
sit
on
the
green
with
a
beggar
bowl
but
of
course
i
would
not
permit
that
and
for
the
present
i
just
give
him
all
he
wants
no
doubt
when
he
goes
away
which
i
hope
will
not
be
for
many
weeks
yet
though
no
one
can
tell
when
he
will
have
another
call
i
shall
slip
something
suitably
generous
into
his
hand
but
i
do
think
about
that
must
you
be
going
good
night
dear
georgie
peace
om
his
last
backward
glance
as
he
went
out
of
the
front
door
revealed
her
standing
on
one
leg
again
just
as
he
had
seen
her
first
he
remembered
a
print
of
a
fakir
at
benares
standing
in
that
attitude
and
if
the
stream
that
flowed
into
the
avon
could
be
combined
with
the
ganges
and
the
garden
into
the
burning
ghaut
and
the
swooping
swallows
into
the
kites
and
the
neat
who
showed
him
out
into
a
brahmin
and
the
chinese
gong
that
was
so
prominent
an
object
in
the
hall
into
a
piece
of
benares
brassware
he
could
almost
have
fancied
himself
as
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
sacred
river
the
marigolds
in
the
garden
required
no
transmutation
georgie
had
quite
to
pull
himself
together
as
he
stepped
round
mrs
quantock
mulberry
tree
and
ten
paces
later
round
his
own
before
he
could
recapture
his
normal
evening
mood
on
those
occasions
when
he
was
going
to
dine
alone
usually
these
evenings
were
very
pleasant
and
much
occupied
for
they
did
not
occur
very
often
in
this
whirl
of
riseholme
life
and
it
was
not
more
than
once
a
week
that
he
spent
a
solitary
evening
and
then
if
he
got
tired
of
his
own
company
there
were
half
a
dozen
houses
easy
of
access
where
he
could
betake
himself
in
his
military
cloak
and
spend
a
hour
but
oftener
than
not
when
these
occasions
occurred
he
would
be
quite
busy
at
home
dusting
a
little
china
and
rearranging
ornaments
on
his
shelves
and
after
putting
his
rings
and
handkerchief
in
the
of
the
piano
spending
a
serious
hour
with
the
soft
pedal
down
for
fear
of
irritating
robert
in
reading
his
share
of
such
duets
as
he
would
be
likely
to
be
called
upon
to
play
with
lucia
during
the
next
day
or
two
though
he
read
music
much
better
than
she
did
he
used
to
go
over
the
part
alone
first
and
let
it
be
understood
that
he
had
not
seen
it
before
but
then
he
was
sure
that
she
had
done
precisely
the
same
so
they
started
fair
such
things
whiled
away
very
pleasantly
the
hours
till
eleven
when
he
went
to
bed
and
it
was
seldom
that
he
had
to
set
out
to
tide
him
over
the
slow
minutes
but
every
now
and
then
and
tonight
was
one
of
those
occasions
there
occurred
evenings
when
he
never
went
out
to
dinner
even
if
he
was
asked
because
he
was
busy
indoors
they
occurred
about
once
a
month
these
evenings
that
he
was
busy
indoors
and
even
an
invitation
from
lucia
would
not
succeed
in
disturbing
them
ages
ago
riseholme
had
decided
what
made
georgie
busy
indoors
once
a
month
and
so
none
of
his
friends
chatted
about
the
nature
of
his
engagements
to
anyone
else
simply
because
everybody
else
knew
his
business
indoors
in
fact
was
a
perfect
secret
from
having
been
public
property
for
so
long
june
had
been
a
very
busy
time
not
indoors
but
with
other
engagements
and
as
georgie
went
up
to
his
bedroom
having
been
told
by
foljambe
that
the
was
waiting
for
him
and
had
been
waiting
this
last
ten
minutes
he
glanced
at
his
hair
in
the
cromwellian
mirror
that
hung
on
the
stairs
and
was
quite
aware
that
it
was
time
he
submitted
himself
to
mr
holroyd
ministrations
there
was
certainly
an
undergrowth
of
grey
hair
visible
beneath
his
chestnut
crop
that
should
have
been
attended
to
at
least
a
fortnight
ago
also
there
was
a
growing
thinness
in
the
locks
that
crossed
his
head
mr
holroyd
had
attended
to
that
before
and
had
suggested
a
certain
remedy
not
in
the
least
inconvenient
unless
georgie
proposed
to
be
athletic
without
a
cap
in
a
high
wind
and
even
then
not
necessarily
so
but
as
he
had
no
intention
of
being
athletic
anywhere
with
or
without
a
cap
he
determined
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
that
he
would
follow
mr
holroyd
advice
mr
holroyd
procedure
without
this
added
formula
entailed
sitting
till
it
dried
and
after
that
he
would
have
dinner
and
then
mr
holroyd
would
begin
again
he
was
a
very
clever
person
with
regard
to
the
face
and
the
hands
and
the
feet
georgie
had
been
conscious
of
walking
a
little
lamely
lately
he
had
been
even
more
conscious
of
the
need
of
hot
towels
on
his
face
and
the
of
mr
holroyd
fingers
and
the
stretchings
of
mr
holroyd
thumb
across
rather
slack
surfaces
of
cheek
and
chin
in
the
interval
between
the
hair
and
the
face
mr
holroyd
should
have
a
good
supper
downstairs
with
foljambe
and
the
cook
and
tomorrow
morning
when
he
met
hermy
and
ursy
georgie
would
be
just
as
spick
and
span
and
young
as
ever
if
not
more
so
georgie
happy
innocent
was
completely
unaware
that
the
whole
of
riseholme
knew
that
the
smooth
chestnut
locks
which
covered
the
top
of
his
head
were
trained
like
the
tendrils
of
a
grapevine
from
the
roots
and
flowed
like
a
river
over
a
bare
head
and
consequently
when
mr
holroyd
explained
the
proposed
innovation
a
little
central
wig
the
edges
of
which
would
mingle
in
the
most
natural
manner
with
his
own
hair
it
seemed
to
georgie
that
nobody
would
know
the
difference
in
addition
he
would
be
spared
those
risky
moments
when
he
had
to
take
off
his
hat
to
a
friend
in
a
high
wind
for
there
was
always
the
danger
of
his
hair
blowing
away
from
the
top
of
his
head
and
hanging
down
like
the
tresses
of
a
over
one
shoulder
so
mr
holroyd
was
commissioned
to
put
that
little
affair
in
hand
at
once
and
when
the
greyness
had
been
attended
to
and
georgie
had
had
his
dinner
there
came
hot
towels
and
tappings
on
his
face
and
other
ministrations
all
was
done
about
half
past
ten
and
when
he
came
downstairs
again
for
a
short
practice
at
the
bass
part
of
beethoven
fifth
symphony
ingeniously
arranged
for
two
performers
on
the
piano
he
looked
with
sincere
satisfaction
at
his
rosy
face
in
the
cromwellian
mirror
and
his
shoes
felt
quite
comfortable
again
and
his
nails
shone
like
pink
stars
as
his
hands
dashed
wildly
about
the
piano
in
the
quicker
passages
but
all
the
time
the
thought
of
the
guru
next
door
under
whose
tuition
he
might
be
able
to
regain
his
youth
without
recourse
to
those
expensive
subterfuges
for
the
price
of
the
undetectable
astonished
him
rang
in
his
head
with
a
melody
more
haunting
than
beethoven
what
he
would
have
liked
best
of
all
would
have
been
to
have
the
guru
all
to
himself
so
that
he
should
remain
perpetually
young
while
all
the
rest
of
riseholme
including
hermy
and
ursy
grew
old
then
indeed
he
would
be
king
of
the
place
instead
of
serving
the
interests
of
its
queen
he
rose
with
a
little
sigh
and
after
adjusting
the
strip
of
flannel
over
the
keys
shut
his
piano
and
busied
himself
for
a
little
with
a
soft
duster
over
his
cabinet
of
bibelots
which
not
even
foljambe
was
allowed
to
touch
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
had
inherited
them
though
the
inheritance
had
chiefly
passed
to
him
through
the
medium
of
curiosity
shops
and
there
were
several
pieces
of
considerable
value
among
them
there
were
a
gold
louis
xvi
snuff
box
a
miniature
by
karl
huth
a
silver
toy
porringer
of
the
time
of
queen
anne
a
piece
of
bow
china
an
enamelled
cigarette
case
by
faberge
but
tonight
his
handling
of
them
was
not
so
dainty
and
delicate
as
usual
and
he
actually
dropped
the
porringer
on
the
floor
as
he
was
dusting
it
for
his
mind
still
occupied
itself
with
the
guru
and
the
practices
that
led
to
permanent
youth
how
quick
lucia
had
been
to
snap
him
up
for
her
yet
perhaps
she
would
not
get
him
for
he
might
say
he
was
not
sent
but
surely
he
would
be
sent
to
georgie
whom
he
knew
the
moment
he
set
eyes
on
him
to
have
a
clean
white
soul
the
clock
struck
eleven
and
as
usual
on
warm
nights
georgie
opened
the
glass
door
into
his
garden
and
drew
in
a
breath
of
the
night
air
there
was
a
slip
of
moon
in
the
sky
which
he
most
punctiliously
saluted
wondering
though
he
did
not
seriously
believe
in
its
superstition
how
lucia
could
be
so
foolhardy
as
to
cut
the
new
moon
she
had
seen
it
yesterday
she
told
him
in
london
and
had
taken
no
notice
whatever
of
it
the
heavens
were
quickly
peppered
with
pretty
stars
which
georgie
after
his
busy
interesting
day
enjoyed
looking
at
though
if
he
had
had
the
arrangement
of
them
he
would
certainly
have
put
them
into
more
definite
patterns
among
them
was
a
very
red
planet
and
georgie
with
recollections
of
his
classical
education
easily
remembered
that
mars
the
god
of
war
was
symbolized
in
the
heavens
by
a
red
star
could
that
mean
anything
to
peaceful
riseholme
was
internal
warfare
were
revolutionary
movements
possible
in
so
serene
a
realm
chapter
four
pink
irascible
robert
prone
to
throw
his
food
about
his
plate
if
it
did
not
commend
itself
to
him
felt
in
an
extremely
good
natured
mood
that
same
night
after
dinner
for
the
guru
had
again
made
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
with
the
result
that
instead
of
a
slab
of
pale
dead
codfish
being
put
before
him
after
he
had
eaten
some
tepid
soup
there
appeared
a
delicious
little
the
guru
had
behaved
with
great
tact
he
had
seen
the
storm
gathering
on
poor
robert
face
as
he
sipped
the
cool
effete
concoction
and
put
down
his
spoon
again
with
a
splash
in
his
soup
plate
and
thereupon
had
bowed
and
smiled
and
scurried
away
to
the
kitchen
to
intercept
the
next
abomination
then
returning
with
the
little
curry
he
explained
that
it
was
entirely
for
robert
since
those
who
sought
the
way
did
not
indulge
in
hot
sharp
foods
and
so
he
had
gobbled
it
up
to
the
very
last
morsel
in
consequence
when
the
guru
salaamed
very
humbly
and
said
that
with
gracious
permission
of
beloved
lady
and
kind
master
he
would
go
and
meditate
in
his
room
and
had
shambled
away
in
his
red
slippers
the
discussion
which
robert
had
felt
himself
obliged
to
open
with
his
wife
on
the
subject
of
having
an
unknown
indian
staying
with
them
for
an
indefinite
period
was
opened
in
a
much
more
amicable
key
than
it
would
have
been
on
a
slice
of
codfish
well
now
about
this
golliwog
haha
i
should
say
guru
my
dear
he
began
what
going
to
happen
daisy
quantock
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
and
winced
at
this
irreverence
but
quickly
remembered
that
she
must
always
be
sending
out
messages
of
love
north
east
south
and
west
so
she
sent
a
rather
spiky
one
in
the
direction
of
her
husband
who
was
sitting
due
east
so
that
it
probably
got
to
him
at
once
and
smiled
the
particular
hard
firm
smile
which
was
an
heirloom
inherited
from
her
last
rule
of
life
no
one
knows
she
said
brightly
even
the
guides
ca
tell
where
and
when
a
guru
may
be
called
then
do
you
propose
he
should
stop
here
till
he
called
somewhere
else
she
continued
smiling
i
do
propose
anything
she
said
it
not
in
my
hands
under
the
calming
influence
of
the
fish
curry
robert
remained
still
placid
he
a
cook
anyhow
he
said
ca
you
engage
him
as
that
call
to
the
kitchen
you
know
darling
said
mrs
quantock
sending
out
more
love
but
she
had
a
quick
temper
and
indeed
the
two
were
outpoured
together
like
hot
and
cold
taps
turned
on
in
a
bath
the
pellucid
stream
of
love
served
to
keep
her
temper
moderately
cool
well
ask
him
suggested
mr
quantock
as
you
say
you
never
can
tell
where
a
guru
may
be
called
give
him
forty
pounds
a
year
and
beer
money
beer
began
mrs
quantock
when
she
suddenly
remembered
story
about
rush
and
the
guru
and
the
and
stopped
yes
dear
i
said
remarked
robert
a
little
irritably
and
in
any
case
i
insist
that
you
dismiss
your
present
cook
you
only
took
her
because
she
was
a
christian
scientist
and
you
left
that
little
now
you
used
to
talk
about
false
claims
i
remember
well
her
claim
to
be
a
cook
is
the
falsest
i
ever
heard
of
i
sooner
take
my
chance
with
an
itinerant
organ
grinder
but
that
tonight
and
that
other
thing
last
night
that
what
i
mean
by
good
eating
the
thought
even
of
good
food
always
calmed
robert
savage
breast
it
blew
upon
him
as
the
wind
on
an
aeolian
harp
hung
in
the
trees
evoking
faint
sweet
sounds
i
sure
my
dear
he
said
that
i
shall
be
willing
to
fall
in
with
any
pleasant
arrangement
about
your
guru
but
it
really
unreasonable
in
me
to
ask
what
sort
of
arrangement
you
propose
i
have
a
word
to
say
against
him
especially
when
he
goes
to
the
kitchen
i
only
want
to
know
if
he
is
going
to
stop
here
a
night
or
two
or
a
year
or
two
talk
to
him
about
it
tomorrow
with
my
love
i
wonder
if
he
can
make
bisque
soup
daisy
quantock
carried
quite
a
quantity
of
material
for
reflection
upstairs
with
her
then
she
went
to
bed
pausing
a
moment
opposite
the
guru
door
from
inside
of
which
came
sounds
of
breathing
so
deep
that
it
sounded
almost
like
snoring
but
she
seemed
to
detect
a
timbre
of
spirituality
about
it
which
convinced
her
that
he
was
holding
high
communion
with
the
guides
it
was
round
him
that
her
thoughts
centred
he
was
the
tree
through
the
branches
of
which
they
scampered
chattering
her
first
and
main
interest
in
him
was
sheer
guruism
for
she
was
one
of
those
intensely
happy
people
who
pass
through
life
in
ecstatic
pursuit
of
some
idea
which
those
who
do
not
share
it
call
a
fad
well
might
poor
robert
remember
the
devastation
of
his
home
when
daisy
after
the
perusal
of
a
little
pamphlet
which
she
picked
up
on
a
called
the
uric
acid
monthly
came
to
the
shattering
conclusion
that
her
buxom
frame
consisted
almost
entirely
of
which
must
be
eliminated
for
a
greedy
man
the
situation
was
frankly
intolerable
for
when
he
continued
his
ordinary
diet
this
was
before
the
cursed
advent
of
the
christian
science
cook
she
kept
pointing
to
his
plate
and
told
him
that
every
atom
of
that
beef
or
mutton
and
potatoes
turned
from
the
moment
he
swallowed
it
into
chromogens
and
toxins
and
that
his
apparent
appetite
was
merely
the
result
of
fermentation
for
herself
her
platter
was
an
abominable
mess
of
cheese
and
and
apples
and
while
round
her
like
saucers
of
specimen
seeds
were
ranged
little
piles
of
nuts
and
which
supplied
material
and
which
she
weighed
out
with
scrupulous
accuracy
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
uric
acid
monthly
tea
and
coffee
were
taboo
since
they
flooded
the
blood
with
purins
and
the
kitchen
boiler
rumbled
day
and
night
to
supply
the
rivers
of
boiling
water
with
which
taken
in
sips
she
inundated
her
system
strange
gaunt
females
used
to
come
down
from
london
with
small
parcels
full
of
tough
food
that
tasted
of
and
contained
so
much
nutrition
that
a
full
of
it
would
furnish
the
daily
rations
of
any
army
luckily
even
her
iron
constitution
could
not
stand
the
strain
of
such
ideal
living
for
long
and
her
growing
anaemia
threatened
to
undermine
a
constitution
seriously
impaired
by
the
precepts
of
perfect
health
a
course
of
and
other
substantial
viands
loaded
with
uric
acid
restored
her
to
her
former
vigour
thus
reinforced
she
plunged
with
the
same
energy
as
she
had
devoted
to
repelling
uric
acid
into
the
embrace
of
christian
science
the
inhumanity
of
that
sect
towards
both
herself
and
others
took
complete
possession
of
her
and
when
her
husband
complained
on
a
bitter
january
morning
that
his
was
like
an
icehouse
because
the
housemaid
had
forgotten
to
light
the
fire
she
had
no
touch
of
pity
for
him
since
she
knew
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
cold
or
heat
or
pain
and
therefore
you
could
not
feel
cold
but
now
since
according
to
the
new
creed
such
things
as
uric
acid
chromogens
and
purins
had
no
existence
she
could
safely
indulge
in
decent
viands
again
but
her
unhappy
husband
was
not
a
real
gainer
in
this
respect
for
while
he
ate
she
tirelessly
discoursed
to
him
on
the
new
creed
and
asked
him
to
recite
with
her
the
true
statement
of
being
and
on
the
top
of
that
she
dismissed
the
admirable
cook
and
engaged
the
miscreant
from
whom
he
suffered
still
though
christian
science
which
had
allowed
her
cold
to
make
so
long
a
false
claim
on
her
had
followed
the
fad
into
the
limbo
of
her
discarded
beliefs
but
now
once
more
she
had
temporarily
discovered
the
secret
of
life
in
the
teachings
of
the
guru
and
it
was
as
has
been
mentioned
sheer
guruism
that
constituted
the
main
attraction
of
the
new
creed
that
then
being
taken
for
granted
she
turned
her
mind
to
certain
which
to
a
true
riseholmite
were
of
entrancing
interest
she
felt
a
strong
suspicion
that
lucia
contemplated
annexing
her
guru
altogether
for
otherwise
she
would
not
have
returned
so
enthusiastic
a
response
to
her
note
nor
have
sent
georgie
to
deliver
it
nor
have
professed
so
violent
an
interest
in
the
guru
what
then
was
the
correctly
diabolical
policy
to
pursue
should
daisy
quantock
refuse
to
take
him
to
mrs
lucas
altogether
with
a
message
of
regret
that
he
did
not
feel
himself
sent
even
if
she
did
this
did
she
feel
herself
strong
enough
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
in
the
shape
of
the
guru
and
using
him
as
the
attraction
challenge
darling
lucia
to
mutual
combat
in
order
to
decide
who
should
be
the
leader
of
all
that
was
advanced
and
cultured
in
riseholme
society
still
following
that
ramification
of
this
policy
should
she
bribe
georgie
over
to
her
own
revolutionary
camp
by
promising
him
instruction
from
the
guru
or
following
a
less
dashing
line
should
she
take
darling
lucia
and
georgie
into
the
charmed
circle
and
while
retaining
her
own
right
of
treasure
trove
yet
share
it
with
them
in
some
inner
ring
dispensing
the
guru
to
them
if
they
were
good
in
small
doses
mrs
quantock
mind
resembled
in
its
workings
the
manoeuvres
of
a
moth
distracted
by
the
glory
of
several
bright
lights
it
dashed
at
one
got
slightly
singed
and
forgetting
all
about
that
turned
its
attention
to
the
second
and
the
third
taking
headers
into
each
in
turn
without
deciding
which
on
the
whole
was
the
most
enchanting
of
those
luminaries
so
in
order
to
curb
the
exuberance
of
these
frenzied
excursions
she
got
a
half
sheet
of
paper
and
noted
down
the
alternatives
that
she
must
choose
from
i
shall
i
keep
him
entirely
to
myself
ii
shall
i
run
him
for
all
he
is
worth
and
leave
out
l
iii
shall
i
get
g
on
my
side
iv
shall
i
give
l
and
g
bits
she
paused
a
moment
then
remembering
that
he
had
voluntarily
helped
her
very
pretty
housemaid
to
make
the
beds
that
morning
saying
that
his
business
like
the
prince
of
wales
was
to
serve
she
added
v
shall
i
ask
him
to
be
my
cook
for
a
few
seconds
the
brightness
of
her
eager
interest
was
dimmed
as
the
unworthy
suspicion
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
the
prettiness
of
her
housemaid
had
something
to
do
with
his
usefulness
in
the
bedrooms
but
she
instantly
dismissed
it
there
was
the
bottle
of
brandy
too
which
he
had
ordered
from
rush
when
she
had
begged
him
to
order
anything
he
wanted
and
cause
it
to
be
put
down
to
her
account
she
had
not
actually
contemplated
brandy
then
remembering
that
one
of
the
most
necessary
conditions
for
progress
in
yoga
was
that
the
disciple
should
have
complete
confidence
in
the
guru
she
chased
that
also
out
of
her
mind
but
still
even
when
the
lines
of
all
possible
policies
were
written
down
she
could
come
to
no
decision
and
putting
her
paper
by
her
bed
decided
to
sleep
over
it
the
rhythmical
sounds
of
hallowed
breathing
came
steadily
from
next
door
and
she
murmured
om
om
in
time
with
them
the
hours
of
the
morning
between
breakfast
and
lunch
were
the
time
which
the
inhabitants
of
riseholme
chiefly
devoted
to
spying
on
each
other
they
went
about
from
shop
to
shop
on
household
businesses
occasionally
making
purchases
which
they
carried
away
with
them
in
little
paper
parcels
with
convenient
loops
of
string
but
the
real
object
of
these
excursions
was
to
see
what
everybody
else
was
doing
and
learn
what
fresh
interests
had
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
during
the
night
georgie
would
be
matching
silks
at
the
draper
and
very
naturally
he
would
carry
them
from
the
obscurity
of
the
interior
to
the
door
in
order
to
be
certain
about
the
shades
and
keep
his
eye
on
the
comings
and
goings
in
the
street
and
very
naturally
mr
lucas
on
his
way
to
the
market
gardener
to
enquire
whether
he
had
yet
received
the
bulbs
from
holland
would
tell
him
that
lucia
had
received
the
of
the
mozart
trio
georgie
for
his
part
would
mention
that
hermy
and
ursy
were
expected
that
evening
and
peppino
enriched
by
this
item
would
toddle
on
as
his
phrase
went
to
meet
and
exchange
confidences
with
the
next
spy
he
had
noticed
incidentally
that
georgie
carried
a
small
oblong
box
with
hard
corners
which
perfectly
correctly
he
conjectured
to
be
cigarettes
for
hermy
and
ursy
since
georgie
never
smoked
well
i
must
be
toddling
on
he
said
after
identifying
georgie
box
of
cigarettes
and
being
rather
puzzled
by
a
bulge
in
georgie
pocket
you
be
looking
in
some
time
this
morning
perhaps
georgie
had
not
been
quite
sure
that
he
would
for
he
was
very
busy
owing
to
the
arrival
of
his
sisters
and
the
necessity
of
going
to
mr
holroyd
in
order
that
that
artist
might
accurately
match
the
shade
of
his
hair
with
a
view
to
the
expensive
toupet
but
the
mention
of
the
arrival
of
the
mozart
now
decided
him
he
intended
anyhow
before
he
went
home
for
lunch
to
stroll
past
the
hurst
and
see
if
he
did
not
hear
to
adopt
a
mixed
metaphor
the
sound
of
the
diligent
practice
of
that
classical
morsel
going
on
inside
probably
the
soft
pedal
would
be
down
but
he
had
marvellously
acute
hearing
and
he
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
he
did
not
hear
the
recognisable
chords
and
even
more
surprised
if
when
they
came
to
practise
the
piece
together
lucia
did
not
give
him
to
understand
that
she
was
reading
it
for
the
first
time
he
had
already
got
a
copy
and
had
practised
his
part
last
night
but
then
he
was
in
the
superior
position
of
not
having
a
husband
who
would
inadvertently
tell
on
him
meantime
it
was
of
the
first
importance
to
get
that
particular
shade
of
purple
silk
that
had
none
of
that
tarsome
in
it
meantime
also
it
was
of
even
greater
importance
to
observe
the
movements
of
riseholme
just
opposite
was
the
village
green
and
as
nobody
was
quite
close
to
him
georgie
put
on
his
spectacles
which
he
could
whisk
off
in
a
moment
it
was
these
which
formed
that
bulge
in
his
pocket
which
peppino
had
noticed
but
the
fact
of
his
using
spectacles
at
all
was
a
secret
that
would
have
to
be
profoundly
kept
for
several
years
yet
but
as
there
was
no
one
at
all
near
him
he
stealthily
adjusted
them
on
his
small
straight
nose
the
morning
train
from
town
had
evidently
come
in
for
there
was
a
bustle
of
cabs
about
the
door
of
the
ambermere
arms
and
a
thing
that
thrilled
him
to
the
marrow
was
the
fact
that
lady
ambermere
motor
was
undoubtedly
among
them
that
must
surely
mean
that
lady
ambermere
herself
was
here
for
when
poor
thin
miss
lyall
her
companion
came
in
to
riseholme
to
do
shopping
or
transact
such
business
as
the
majestic
life
at
the
hall
required
she
always
came
on
foot
or
in
very
inclement
weather
in
a
small
cart
like
a
at
this
moment
steeped
in
conjecture
who
should
appear
walking
stiffly
with
her
nose
in
the
air
as
if
suspecting
and
not
choosing
to
verify
some
faint
unpleasant
odour
but
lady
ambermere
herself
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
hurst
clearly
she
must
have
got
there
after
peppino
had
left
or
he
would
surely
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
lady
ambermere
had
been
at
the
hurst
if
she
been
at
the
hurst
it
is
true
that
she
was
only
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
hurst
but
georgie
put
into
practice
in
his
mental
processes
darwin
principle
that
in
order
to
observe
usefully
you
must
have
a
theory
georgie
theory
was
that
lady
ambermere
had
been
at
the
hurst
just
for
a
minute
or
two
and
hastily
put
his
spectacles
in
his
pocket
with
the
precision
of
a
trained
mind
he
also
formed
the
theory
that
some
business
had
brought
lady
ambermere
into
riseholme
and
that
taking
advantage
of
her
presence
there
she
had
probably
returned
a
verbal
answer
to
lucia
invitation
to
her
which
she
would
have
received
by
the
first
post
this
morning
he
was
quite
ready
to
put
his
theory
to
the
test
when
lady
ambermere
had
arrived
at
the
suitable
distance
for
his
conveniently
observing
her
and
for
taking
off
his
hat
she
always
treated
him
like
a
boy
which
he
liked
the
usual
salutation
passed
i
do
know
where
my
people
are
said
lady
ambermere
majestically
have
you
seen
my
motor
yes
dear
lady
it
in
at
your
own
arms
said
georgie
brightly
happy
motor
if
lady
ambermere
unbent
to
anybody
she
unbent
to
georgie
he
was
of
quite
good
family
because
his
mother
had
been
a
bartlett
and
a
second
cousin
of
her
deceased
husband
sometimes
when
she
talked
to
georgie
she
said
we
implying
thereby
his
connection
with
the
aristocracy
and
this
gratified
georgie
nearly
as
much
as
did
her
treatment
of
him
as
being
quite
a
boy
still
it
was
to
him
as
a
boy
still
that
she
answered
well
the
happy
motor
you
little
rascal
must
come
to
my
arms
instead
of
being
at
them
she
said
with
the
quick
wit
for
which
riseholme
pronounced
her
famous
fancy
being
able
to
see
my
motor
at
that
distance
young
eyes
it
was
really
young
spectacles
but
georgie
did
not
mind
that
in
fact
he
would
not
have
corrected
the
mistake
for
the
world
shall
i
run
across
and
fetch
it
for
you
he
asked
in
a
minute
or
whistle
on
your
fingers
like
a
vulgar
street
boy
said
lady
ambermere
i
sure
you
know
how
to
georgie
had
not
the
slightest
idea
but
with
the
courage
of
youth
presuming
with
the
prudence
of
that
he
would
not
really
be
called
upon
to
perform
so
unimaginable
a
feat
he
put
two
fingers
up
to
his
mouth
here
goes
then
he
said
greatly
daring
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
dignity
of
lady
ambermere
would
not
permit
rude
vulgar
whistling
of
which
he
was
hopelessly
incapable
to
summon
her
motor
she
made
a
feint
of
stopping
her
ears
with
her
hands
do
do
anything
of
the
kind
she
said
in
a
minute
you
shall
walk
with
me
across
to
the
arms
but
tell
me
this
first
i
have
just
been
to
say
to
our
good
mrs
lucas
that
very
likely
i
will
look
in
at
her
on
friday
if
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
who
is
this
wonderful
creature
she
is
expecting
is
it
an
indian
conjurer
if
so
i
should
like
to
see
him
because
when
ambermere
was
in
madras
i
remember
one
coming
to
the
residency
who
had
cobras
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
told
her
i
did
like
snakes
and
she
said
there
should
be
any
in
fact
it
was
all
rather
mysterious
and
she
did
at
present
know
if
he
was
coming
or
not
i
only
said
snakes
i
insist
on
no
snakes
georgie
relieved
her
mind
about
the
chance
of
there
being
snakes
and
gave
a
short
of
the
ascertained
habits
of
the
guru
laying
special
stress
on
his
yes
some
of
these
brahmins
are
of
very
decent
family
admitted
lady
ambermere
i
was
always
against
lumping
all
people
together
and
calling
them
niggers
when
we
were
at
madras
i
was
famed
for
my
discrimination
they
were
walking
across
the
green
as
lady
ambermere
gave
vent
to
these
liberal
sentiments
and
georgie
even
without
the
need
of
his
spectacles
could
see
peppino
who
had
spied
lady
ambermere
from
the
door
of
the
hurrying
down
the
street
in
order
to
get
a
word
with
her
before
her
people
drove
her
back
to
the
hall
i
came
into
riseholme
today
to
get
rooms
at
the
arms
for
olga
bracely
she
observed
the
asked
georgie
breathless
with
excitement
yes
she
is
coming
to
stay
at
the
arms
for
two
nights
with
mr
shuttleworth
surely
began
georgie
no
it
is
all
right
he
is
her
husband
they
were
married
last
week
said
lady
ambermere
i
should
have
thought
that
shuttleworth
was
a
good
enough
name
as
the
shuttleworths
are
cousins
of
the
late
lord
but
she
prefers
to
call
herself
miss
bracely
i
do
dispute
her
right
to
call
herself
what
she
pleases
far
from
it
though
who
the
bracelys
were
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
but
when
george
shuttleworth
wrote
to
me
saying
that
he
and
his
wife
were
intending
to
stay
here
for
a
couple
of
days
and
proposing
to
come
over
to
the
hall
to
see
me
i
thought
i
would
just
look
in
at
the
arms
myself
and
see
that
they
were
promised
proper
accommodation
they
will
dine
with
me
tomorrow
i
have
a
few
people
staying
and
no
doubt
miss
bracely
will
sing
afterwards
my
broadwood
was
always
considered
a
remarkably
fine
instrument
it
was
very
proper
of
george
shuttleworth
to
say
that
he
would
be
in
the
neighbourhood
and
i
daresay
she
is
a
very
decent
sort
of
woman
they
had
come
to
the
motor
by
this
time
the
rich
the
noble
motor
as
mr
pepys
would
have
described
it
and
there
was
poor
miss
lyall
hung
with
parcels
and
wearing
a
faint
sycophantic
smile
this
miserable
spinster
of
age
so
obvious
as
to
be
called
not
the
least
uncertain
was
lady
ambermere
companion
and
shared
with
her
the
glories
of
the
hall
which
had
been
left
to
lady
ambermere
for
life
she
was
provided
with
food
and
lodging
and
the
use
of
the
cart
like
a
when
lady
ambermere
had
errands
for
her
to
do
in
riseholme
so
what
could
a
woman
want
more
in
return
for
these
bounties
her
only
duty
was
to
devote
herself
body
and
mind
to
her
patroness
to
read
the
paper
aloud
to
set
lady
ambermere
patterns
for
needlework
to
carry
the
little
chinese
dog
under
her
arm
and
wash
him
once
a
week
to
accompany
lady
ambermere
to
church
and
never
to
have
a
fire
in
her
bedroom
she
had
a
melancholy
wistful
little
face
her
head
was
inclined
with
a
backward
slope
on
her
neck
and
her
mouth
was
invariably
a
little
open
shewing
long
front
teeth
so
that
she
looked
rather
like
a
roast
hare
sent
up
to
table
with
its
head
on
georgie
always
had
a
joke
ready
for
miss
lyall
of
the
sort
that
made
her
say
oh
mr
pillson
and
caused
her
to
blush
she
thought
him
remarkably
pleasant
georgie
had
his
joke
ready
on
this
occasion
why
here
miss
lyall
he
said
and
what
has
miss
lyall
been
doing
while
her
ladyship
and
i
have
been
talking
better
not
ask
perhaps
oh
mr
pillson
said
miss
lyall
as
punctually
as
a
cuckoo
clock
when
the
hands
point
to
the
hour
lady
ambermere
put
half
her
weight
onto
the
step
of
the
motor
causing
it
to
creak
and
sway
call
on
the
shuttleworths
georgie
she
said
say
i
told
you
to
home
miss
lyall
effaced
herself
on
the
front
seat
of
the
motor
like
a
mouse
hiding
in
a
corner
after
lady
ambermere
had
got
in
and
the
footman
mounted
onto
the
box
at
that
moment
peppino
with
his
bag
of
bulbs
a
little
out
of
breath
squeezed
his
way
between
two
cabs
by
the
side
of
the
motor
he
was
just
too
late
and
the
motor
moved
off
it
was
very
improbable
that
lady
ambermere
saw
him
at
all
georgie
felt
very
much
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
in
his
mouth
who
only
wants
to
get
away
from
all
the
other
dogs
and
discuss
it
quietly
it
is
safe
to
say
that
never
in
hours
had
so
many
exciting
things
happened
to
him
he
had
ordered
a
toupet
he
had
been
looked
on
with
favour
by
a
guru
all
riseholme
knew
that
he
had
had
quite
a
long
conversation
with
lady
ambermere
and
nobody
in
riseholme
except
himself
knew
that
olga
bracely
was
going
to
spend
two
nights
here
well
he
remembered
her
marvellous
appearance
last
year
at
covent
garden
in
the
part
of
brunnhilde
he
had
gone
to
town
for
a
rejuvenating
visit
to
his
dentist
and
the
tarsomeness
of
being
betwixt
and
between
had
been
quite
forgotten
by
him
when
he
saw
her
awake
to
siegfried
line
on
the
ist
keine
siegfried
had
said
and
to
be
sure
that
was
very
clever
of
him
for
she
looked
like
some
slim
beardless
boy
and
not
in
the
least
like
those
great
fat
fraus
at
baireuth
whom
nobody
could
have
mistaken
for
a
man
as
they
bulged
and
heaved
even
before
the
strings
of
the
breastplate
were
uncut
by
his
sword
and
then
she
sat
up
and
hailed
the
sun
and
georgie
felt
for
a
moment
that
he
had
quite
taken
the
wrong
turn
in
life
when
he
settled
to
spend
his
years
in
this
boyish
maidenly
manner
with
his
embroidery
and
his
at
riseholme
he
ought
to
have
been
siegfried
he
had
brought
a
photograph
of
her
in
her
cuirass
and
helmet
and
often
looked
at
it
when
he
was
not
too
busy
with
something
else
he
had
even
championed
his
goddess
against
lucia
when
she
pronounced
that
wagner
was
totally
lacking
in
knowledge
of
dramatic
effects
to
be
sure
she
had
never
seen
any
wagner
opera
but
she
had
heard
the
overture
to
tristram
performed
at
the
queen
hall
and
if
that
was
wagner
well
already
though
lady
ambermere
motor
had
not
yet
completely
vanished
up
the
street
riseholme
was
gently
closing
in
round
him
in
order
to
discover
by
discreet
questions
as
in
the
game
of
clumps
what
he
and
she
had
been
talking
about
there
was
colonel
boucher
with
his
two
snorting
closing
in
from
one
side
and
mrs
weston
in
her
being
wheeled
relentlessly
towards
him
from
another
and
the
two
miss
antrobuses
sitting
playfully
in
the
stocks
on
the
third
and
peppino
at
close
range
on
the
fourth
everyone
knew
too
that
he
did
not
lunch
till
half
past
one
and
there
was
really
no
reason
why
he
should
not
stop
and
chat
as
usual
but
with
the
eye
of
the
true
general
he
saw
that
he
could
most
easily
break
the
surrounding
cordon
by
going
off
in
the
direction
of
colonel
boucher
because
colonel
boucher
always
said
haw
hum
by
jove
before
he
descended
into
coherent
speech
and
thus
georgie
could
forestall
him
with
good
morning
colonel
and
pass
on
before
he
got
to
business
he
did
not
like
passing
close
to
those
slobbering
but
something
had
to
be
done
next
moment
he
was
clear
and
saw
that
the
other
spies
by
their
original
impetus
were
still
converging
on
each
other
and
walked
briskly
down
towards
lucia
house
to
listen
for
any
familiar
noises
out
of
the
mozart
trio
the
noises
were
there
and
the
soft
pedal
was
down
just
as
he
expected
so
that
business
being
off
his
mind
he
continued
his
walk
for
a
few
hundred
yards
more
meaning
to
make
a
short
circuit
through
fields
cross
the
bridge
over
the
happy
stream
that
flowed
into
the
avon
and
regain
his
house
by
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
then
he
would
sit
and
think
the
guru
olga
bracely
what
if
he
asked
olga
bracely
and
her
husband
to
dine
and
persuaded
mrs
quantock
to
let
the
guru
come
that
would
be
three
men
and
one
woman
and
hermy
and
ursy
would
make
all
square
six
for
dinner
was
the
utmost
that
foljambe
permitted
he
had
come
to
the
stile
that
led
into
the
fields
and
sat
there
for
a
moment
lucia
tentative
melodies
were
still
faintly
audible
but
soon
they
stopped
and
he
guessed
that
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
she
was
too
great
to
take
part
in
the
morning
spying
that
went
on
round
about
the
green
but
she
often
saw
a
good
deal
from
her
window
he
wondered
what
mrs
quantock
was
meaning
to
do
apparently
she
had
not
promised
the
guru
for
the
or
else
lady
ambermere
would
not
have
said
that
lucia
did
not
know
whether
he
was
coming
or
not
perhaps
mrs
quantock
was
going
to
run
him
herself
and
grant
him
neither
to
lucia
nor
georgie
in
that
case
he
would
certainly
ask
olga
bracely
and
her
husband
to
dine
and
should
he
or
should
he
not
ask
lucia
the
red
star
had
risen
in
riseholme
bolshevism
was
treading
in
its
peaceful
air
and
if
mrs
quantock
was
going
to
secrete
her
guru
and
set
up
her
own
standard
on
the
strength
of
him
georgie
felt
much
inclined
to
ask
olga
bracely
to
dinner
without
saying
anything
whatever
to
lucia
about
it
and
just
see
what
would
happen
next
georgie
was
a
bartlett
on
his
mother
side
and
he
played
the
piano
better
than
lucia
and
he
had
hours
leisure
every
day
which
he
could
devote
to
being
king
of
riseholme
his
nature
flared
up
burning
with
a
red
revolutionary
flame
that
was
fed
by
his
secret
knowledge
about
olga
bracely
why
should
lucia
rule
everyone
with
her
rod
of
iron
why
and
again
why
suddenly
he
heard
his
name
called
in
the
familiar
alto
and
there
was
lucia
in
her
shakespeare
garden
georgino
georgino
mio
she
cried
gino
out
of
mere
habit
georgie
got
down
from
his
stile
and
tripped
up
the
road
towards
her
the
manly
seething
of
his
soul
insurrection
rebuked
him
but
unfortunately
his
legs
and
his
voice
surrendered
habit
was
strong
amica
he
answered
buon
giorno
and
why
do
i
say
it
in
italian
he
vainly
asked
himself
geordie
come
and
have
ickle
talk
she
said
me
want
wise
man
to
advise
ickle
lucia
what
want
asked
georgie
now
quite
quelled
for
the
moment
here
pwetty
flower
for
now
tell
me
about
black
man
him
no
snakes
have
why
mrs
quantock
say
she
thinks
he
no
come
to
poo
lucia
oh
did
she
asked
georgie
relapsing
into
the
vernacular
yes
oh
and
by
the
way
there
a
parcel
come
which
i
think
must
be
the
mozart
trio
will
you
come
over
tomorrow
morning
and
read
it
with
me
yes
about
eleven
then
but
never
mind
that
she
fixed
him
with
her
ready
birdy
eye
daisy
asked
me
to
ask
him
she
said
and
so
to
oblige
poor
daisy
i
did
and
now
she
says
she
does
know
if
he
come
what
does
that
mean
is
it
possible
that
she
wants
to
keep
him
to
herself
she
has
done
that
sort
of
thing
before
you
know
this
probably
represented
lucia
statement
of
the
said
case
about
the
welsh
attorney
and
georgie
taking
it
as
such
felt
rather
embarrassed
also
that
eye
seemed
to
gimlet
its
way
into
his
very
soul
and
divine
the
secret
disloyalty
that
he
had
been
contemplating
if
she
had
continued
to
look
into
him
he
might
not
only
have
confessed
to
the
gloomiest
suspicions
about
mrs
quantock
but
have
let
go
of
his
secret
about
olga
bracely
also
and
suggested
the
possibility
of
her
and
her
husband
being
brought
to
the
but
the
eye
at
this
moment
unscrewed
itself
from
him
again
and
travelled
up
the
road
there
the
guru
she
said
now
we
will
see
georgie
faint
with
emotion
peered
out
between
the
form
of
the
peacock
and
the
on
the
and
saw
what
followed
lucia
went
straight
up
to
the
guru
bowed
and
smiled
and
clearly
introduced
herself
in
another
moment
he
was
showing
his
white
teeth
and
salaaming
and
together
they
walked
back
to
the
hurst
where
georgie
palpitated
behind
the
together
they
entered
and
lucia
eye
wore
its
most
benignant
aspect
i
want
to
introduce
to
you
guru
she
said
without
a
stumble
a
great
friend
of
mine
this
is
mr
pillson
guru
guru
mr
pillson
the
guru
is
coming
to
tiffin
with
me
georgie
can
not
i
persuade
you
to
stop
delighted
said
georgie
we
met
before
in
a
sort
of
way
did
we
yes
indeed
so
pleased
said
the
guru
let
us
go
in
said
lucia
it
is
close
on
georgie
followed
after
a
great
many
bowings
and
politenesses
from
the
guru
he
was
not
sure
if
he
had
the
makings
of
a
bolshevist
lucia
was
so
marvellously
efficient
chapter
five
one
of
lucia
greatnesses
lay
in
the
fact
that
when
she
found
anybody
out
in
some
act
of
atrocious
meanness
she
never
indulged
in
any
idle
threats
of
revenge
it
was
sufficient
that
she
knew
and
would
take
suitable
steps
on
the
earliest
occasion
consequently
when
it
appeared
from
the
artless
conversation
of
the
guru
at
lunch
that
the
perfidious
mrs
quantock
had
not
even
asked
him
whether
he
would
like
to
go
to
lucia
garden
party
or
not
pending
her
own
decision
as
to
what
she
was
meaning
to
do
with
him
lucia
received
the
information
with
the
utmost
merely
saying
no
doubt
dear
mrs
quantock
forgot
to
tell
you
and
did
not
announce
acts
of
reprisal
such
as
striking
daisy
off
the
list
of
her
habitual
guests
for
a
week
or
two
just
to
give
her
a
lesson
she
even
before
they
sat
down
to
lunch
telephoned
over
to
that
thwarted
woman
to
say
that
she
had
met
the
guru
in
the
street
and
they
had
both
felt
that
there
was
some
wonderful
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
so
he
had
come
back
with
her
and
they
were
just
sitting
down
to
tiffin
she
was
pleased
with
the
word
tiffin
and
also
liked
explaining
to
daisy
what
it
meant
tiffin
was
a
great
success
and
there
was
no
need
for
the
guru
to
visit
the
kitchen
in
order
to
make
something
that
could
be
eaten
without
struggle
he
talked
quite
freely
about
his
mission
here
and
lucia
and
georgie
and
peppino
who
had
come
in
rather
late
for
he
had
been
obliged
to
go
back
to
the
about
the
bulbs
listened
entranced
yes
it
was
when
i
went
to
my
friend
who
keeps
the
he
said
that
i
knew
there
was
english
lady
who
wanted
guru
and
i
knew
i
was
called
to
her
no
luggage
no
anything
at
all
as
i
am
such
a
kind
lady
too
and
she
will
get
on
well
but
she
will
find
some
of
the
postures
difficult
for
she
is
what
you
call
globe
round
was
that
postures
when
i
saw
her
standing
on
one
leg
in
the
garden
asked
georgie
and
when
she
sat
down
and
tried
to
hold
her
toes
yes
indeed
quite
so
and
difficult
for
globe
but
she
has
white
soul
he
looked
round
with
a
smile
i
see
many
white
souls
here
he
said
it
is
happy
place
when
there
are
white
souls
for
to
them
i
am
sent
this
was
sufficient
in
another
minute
lucia
georgie
and
peppino
were
all
accepted
as
pupils
and
presently
they
went
out
into
the
garden
where
the
guru
sat
on
the
ground
in
a
most
complicated
attitude
which
was
obviously
quite
out
of
reach
of
mrs
quantock
one
foot
on
one
thigh
other
foot
on
other
thigh
he
explained
and
the
head
and
back
straight
it
is
good
to
meditate
so
lucia
tried
to
imagine
meditating
so
but
felt
that
any
meditation
so
would
certainly
be
on
the
subject
of
broken
bones
shall
i
be
able
to
do
that
she
asked
and
what
will
be
the
effect
you
will
be
light
and
active
dear
lady
and
ah
here
is
other
dear
lady
come
to
join
us
mrs
quantock
had
certainly
made
one
of
her
diplomatic
errors
on
this
occasion
she
had
acquiesced
on
the
telephone
in
her
guru
going
to
tiffin
with
lucia
but
about
the
middle
of
her
lunch
she
had
been
unable
to
resist
the
desire
to
know
what
was
happening
at
the
hurst
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
lucia
and
her
guru
were
together
now
and
her
own
note
saying
that
it
was
uncertain
whether
the
guru
would
come
to
the
garden
party
or
not
filled
her
with
the
most
uneasy
apprehensions
she
would
sooner
have
acquiesced
in
her
guru
going
to
fifty
where
all
was
public
and
she
could
keep
an
eye
and
a
control
on
him
rather
than
that
lucia
should
have
enticed
him
in
that
was
her
phrase
like
this
to
tiffin
the
only
consolation
was
that
her
own
lunch
had
been
practically
inedible
and
robert
had
languished
lamentably
for
the
guru
to
return
and
save
his
stomach
she
had
left
him
glowering
over
a
little
mud
and
water
called
coffee
robert
at
any
rate
would
welcome
the
return
of
the
guru
she
waddled
across
the
lawn
to
where
this
harmonious
party
was
sitting
and
at
that
moment
lucia
began
to
feel
vindictive
the
calm
of
victory
which
had
permeated
her
when
she
brought
the
guru
in
to
lunch
without
any
bother
at
all
was
troubled
and
broken
up
and
darling
note
containing
the
outrageous
falsity
that
the
guru
would
not
certainly
accept
an
invitation
which
had
never
been
permitted
to
reach
him
at
all
assumed
a
more
sinister
aspect
clearly
now
daisy
had
intended
to
keep
him
to
herself
a
fact
that
she
already
suspected
and
had
made
a
hostile
invasion
guru
dear
you
naughty
thing
said
mrs
quantock
playfully
after
the
usual
salutations
had
passed
why
did
you
not
tell
your
chela
you
would
not
be
home
for
tiffin
the
guru
had
unwound
his
legs
and
stood
up
but
see
beloved
lady
he
said
how
pleasant
we
all
are
take
not
too
much
thought
when
it
is
only
white
souls
who
are
together
mrs
quantock
patted
his
shoulder
it
is
all
good
and
kind
om
she
said
i
send
out
my
message
of
love
there
it
was
necessary
to
descend
from
these
high
altitudes
and
lucia
proceeded
to
do
so
as
in
a
parachute
that
dropped
swiftly
at
first
and
then
floated
in
still
air
and
we
making
such
a
lovely
plan
dear
daisy
she
said
the
guru
is
going
to
teach
us
all
classes
are
you
he
held
his
hands
up
to
his
head
palms
outwards
and
closed
his
eyes
i
seem
to
feel
call
he
said
i
am
sent
surely
the
guides
tell
me
there
is
a
sending
of
me
what
you
call
classes
yes
i
teach
you
learn
we
all
learn
i
leave
all
to
you
i
will
walk
a
little
way
off
to
arbour
and
meditate
and
then
when
you
have
arranged
you
will
tell
guru
who
is
your
servant
salaam
om
with
the
guru
in
her
own
house
and
with
every
intention
to
annex
him
it
was
no
wonder
that
lucia
took
the
part
of
chairman
in
this
meeting
that
was
to
settle
the
details
of
the
esoteric
brotherhood
that
was
to
be
formed
in
riseholme
had
not
mrs
quantock
been
actually
present
lucia
in
revenge
for
her
outrageous
conduct
about
the
invitation
would
probably
have
left
her
out
of
the
classes
altogether
but
with
her
sitting
firm
and
square
in
a
basket
chair
that
creaked
querulously
as
she
moved
she
could
not
be
completely
ignored
but
lucia
took
the
lead
throughout
and
suggested
straightaway
that
the
would
be
the
most
convenient
place
to
hold
the
classes
in
i
should
not
think
of
invading
your
house
dear
daisy
she
said
and
here
is
the
which
no
one
ever
sits
in
so
quiet
and
peaceful
yes
shall
we
consider
that
settled
then
she
turned
briskly
to
mrs
quantock
and
now
where
shall
the
guru
stay
she
said
it
would
be
too
bad
dear
daisy
if
we
are
all
to
profit
by
his
classes
that
you
should
have
all
the
trouble
and
expense
of
entertaining
him
for
in
your
sweet
little
house
he
must
be
a
great
inconvenience
and
i
think
you
said
that
your
husband
had
given
up
his
dressing
room
to
him
mrs
quantock
made
a
desperate
effort
to
retain
her
property
no
inconvenience
at
all
she
said
quite
the
contrary
in
fact
dear
it
is
delightful
having
him
and
robert
regards
him
as
a
most
desirable
inmate
lucia
pressed
her
hand
feelingly
you
and
your
husband
are
too
unselfish
she
said
often
have
i
said
and
mr
robert
are
the
most
unselfish
people
i
know
have
i
georgie
but
we
ca
permit
you
to
be
so
crowded
your
only
spare
room
you
know
your
husband
dressing
room
georgie
i
know
you
agree
with
me
we
must
not
permit
dear
daisy
to
be
so
unselfish
the
eye
produced
its
compelling
effect
on
georgie
so
short
a
time
ago
he
had
indulged
in
revolutionary
ideas
and
had
contemplated
having
the
guru
and
olga
bracely
to
dinner
without
even
asking
lucia
now
the
faint
stirrings
of
revolt
faded
like
snow
in
summer
he
knew
quite
well
what
lucia
next
proposition
would
be
he
knew
too
that
he
would
agree
to
it
no
that
would
never
do
he
said
it
is
simply
trespassing
on
mrs
quantock
if
she
is
to
board
and
lodge
him
while
he
teaches
all
of
us
i
wish
i
could
take
him
in
but
with
hermy
and
ursy
coming
tonight
i
have
as
little
room
as
mrs
quantock
he
shall
come
here
said
lucia
brightly
as
if
she
had
just
that
moment
thought
of
it
there
are
hamlet
and
othello
vacant
all
her
rooms
were
named
after
shakespearian
plays
and
it
will
not
be
the
least
inconvenient
will
it
peppino
i
shall
really
like
having
him
here
shall
we
consider
that
settled
then
daisy
made
a
perfectly
futile
effort
to
send
forth
a
message
of
love
to
all
quarters
of
the
compass
bitterly
she
repented
of
having
ever
mentioned
her
guru
to
lucia
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
annex
him
like
this
while
she
was
cudgelling
her
brains
as
to
how
she
could
arrest
this
powerful
offensive
lucia
went
sublimely
on
then
there
the
question
of
what
we
shall
pay
him
she
said
dear
daisy
tells
us
that
he
scarcely
knows
what
money
is
but
i
for
one
could
never
dream
of
profiting
by
his
wisdom
if
i
was
to
pay
nothing
for
it
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
and
so
i
suppose
the
teacher
is
what
if
we
pay
him
five
shillings
each
a
lesson
that
will
make
a
pound
a
lesson
dear
me
i
shall
be
busy
this
august
now
how
many
classes
shall
we
ask
him
to
give
us
i
should
say
six
to
begin
with
if
everybody
agrees
one
every
day
for
the
next
week
except
sunday
that
is
what
you
all
wish
yes
then
shall
we
consider
that
settled
mrs
quantock
still
impotently
rebelling
resorted
to
the
most
dire
weapon
in
her
armoury
namely
sarcasm
perhaps
darling
lucia
she
said
it
would
be
well
to
ask
my
guru
if
he
has
anything
to
say
to
your
settlings
england
is
a
free
country
still
even
if
you
happen
to
have
come
from
india
lucia
had
a
deadlier
weapon
than
sarcasm
which
was
the
apparent
unconsciousness
of
there
having
been
any
for
it
is
no
use
plunging
a
dagger
into
your
enemy
heart
if
it
produces
no
effect
whatever
on
him
she
clapped
her
hands
together
and
gave
her
peal
of
silvery
laughter
what
a
good
idea
she
said
then
you
would
like
me
to
go
and
tell
him
what
we
propose
just
as
you
like
i
will
trot
away
shall
i
and
see
if
he
agrees
do
think
of
stirring
dear
daisy
i
know
how
you
feel
the
heat
sit
quiet
in
the
shade
as
you
know
i
am
a
real
salamander
the
sun
is
never
for
me
she
tripped
off
to
where
the
guru
was
sitting
in
that
wonderful
position
she
had
read
the
article
in
the
encyclopaedia
about
yoga
right
through
again
this
morning
and
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
as
indeed
her
proceedings
had
just
shown
that
yoga
was
to
put
it
irreverently
to
be
her
august
stunt
he
was
still
so
deep
in
meditation
that
he
could
only
look
dreamily
in
her
direction
as
she
approached
but
then
with
a
long
sigh
he
got
up
this
is
beautiful
place
he
said
it
is
full
of
sweet
influences
and
i
have
had
high
talk
with
guides
lucia
felt
thrilled
ah
do
tell
me
what
they
said
to
you
she
exclaimed
they
told
me
to
follow
where
i
was
led
they
said
they
would
settle
everything
for
me
in
wisdom
and
love
this
was
most
encouraging
for
decidedly
lucia
had
been
settling
for
him
and
the
opinion
of
the
guides
was
thus
a
direct
personal
testimonial
any
faint
twitchings
of
conscience
they
were
of
the
very
faintest
that
she
had
grabbed
dear
daisy
property
were
once
and
for
ever
quieted
and
she
proceeded
confidently
to
unfold
the
settlements
of
wisdom
and
love
which
met
with
the
guru
entire
approval
he
shut
his
eyes
a
moment
and
breathed
deeply
they
give
peace
and
blessing
he
said
it
is
they
who
ordered
that
it
should
be
so
om
he
seemed
to
sink
into
profound
depths
of
meditation
and
lucia
hurried
back
to
the
group
she
had
left
it
is
all
too
wonderful
she
said
the
guides
have
told
him
that
they
were
settling
everything
for
him
in
wisdom
and
love
so
we
may
be
sure
we
were
right
in
our
plans
how
lovely
to
think
that
we
have
been
guided
by
them
dear
daisy
how
wonderful
he
is
i
will
send
across
for
his
things
shall
i
and
i
will
have
hamlet
and
othello
made
ready
for
him
bitter
though
it
was
to
part
with
her
guru
it
was
impious
to
rebel
against
the
ordinances
of
the
guides
but
there
was
a
trace
of
human
resentment
in
daisy
answer
things
she
exclaimed
he
has
got
a
thing
in
the
world
every
material
possession
chains
us
down
to
earth
you
will
soon
come
to
that
darling
lucia
it
occurred
to
georgie
that
the
guru
had
certainly
got
a
bottle
of
brandy
but
there
was
no
use
in
introducing
a
topic
that
might
lead
to
discord
and
indeed
even
as
lucia
went
indoors
to
see
about
hamlet
and
othello
the
guru
himself
having
emerged
from
meditation
joined
them
and
sat
down
by
mrs
quantock
beloved
lady
he
said
all
is
peace
and
happiness
the
guides
have
spoken
to
me
so
lovingly
of
you
and
they
say
it
is
best
your
guru
should
come
here
perhaps
i
shall
return
later
to
your
kind
house
they
smiled
when
i
asked
that
but
just
now
they
send
me
here
there
is
more
need
of
me
here
for
already
you
have
so
much
light
certainly
the
guides
were
very
tactful
people
for
nothing
could
have
soothed
mrs
quantock
so
effectually
as
a
message
of
that
kind
which
she
would
certainly
report
to
lucia
when
she
returned
from
seeing
about
hamlet
and
othello
oh
do
they
say
i
have
much
light
already
guru
dear
she
asked
that
is
nice
of
them
surely
they
said
it
and
now
i
shall
go
back
to
your
house
and
leave
sweet
thoughts
there
for
you
and
shall
i
send
sweet
thoughts
to
the
home
of
the
kind
gentleman
next
door
georgie
eagerly
welcomed
this
proposition
for
with
hermy
and
ursy
coming
that
evening
he
felt
that
he
would
have
plenty
of
use
for
sweet
thoughts
he
even
forebore
to
complete
in
his
own
mind
the
conjecture
that
was
forming
itself
there
namely
that
though
the
guru
would
be
leaving
sweet
thoughts
for
mrs
quantock
he
would
probably
be
taking
away
the
brandy
bottle
for
himself
but
georgie
knew
he
was
only
too
apt
to
indulge
in
secret
cynicisms
and
perhaps
there
was
no
brandy
to
take
away
by
this
time
and
lo
and
behold
he
was
being
cynical
again
the
sun
was
still
hot
when
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
got
into
the
open
cab
which
he
had
ordered
to
take
him
to
the
station
to
meet
hermy
and
ursy
and
he
put
up
his
umbrella
with
its
white
linen
cover
to
shield
him
from
it
he
did
not
take
the
motor
because
either
hermy
or
ursy
would
have
insisted
on
driving
it
and
he
did
not
choose
to
put
himself
in
their
charge
in
all
the
years
that
he
had
lived
at
riseholme
he
never
remembered
a
time
when
social
events
work
he
called
it
had
been
so
exciting
and
varied
there
were
hermy
and
ursy
coming
this
evening
and
olga
bracely
and
her
husband
olga
bracely
and
mr
shuttleworth
sounded
vaguely
improper
georgie
rather
liked
that
were
coming
tomorrow
and
there
was
lucia
the
day
after
and
every
day
there
was
to
be
a
lesson
from
the
guru
so
that
god
alone
knew
when
georgie
would
have
a
moment
to
himself
for
his
embroidery
or
to
practise
the
mozart
trio
but
with
his
hair
to
the
very
roots
and
his
shining
nails
and
his
comfortable
boots
he
felt
extremely
young
and
fit
for
anything
soon
under
the
influence
of
the
new
creed
with
its
postures
and
breathings
he
would
feel
younger
and
more
vigorous
yet
but
he
wished
that
it
had
been
he
who
had
found
this
pamphlet
on
eastern
philosophies
which
had
led
mrs
quantock
to
make
the
inquiries
that
had
resulted
in
the
epiphany
of
the
guru
of
course
when
once
lucia
had
heard
about
it
she
was
certain
to
constitute
herself
head
and
leader
of
the
movement
and
it
was
really
remarkable
how
completely
she
had
done
that
in
that
meeting
in
the
garden
just
now
she
had
just
sailed
through
mrs
quantock
as
calmly
as
a
steamer
cuts
through
the
waters
of
the
sea
throwing
her
off
from
her
penetrating
bows
like
a
spent
wave
but
baffled
though
she
was
for
the
moment
georgie
had
been
aware
that
mrs
quantock
seethed
with
revolutionary
ideas
she
deeply
resented
this
confiscation
of
what
was
certainly
her
property
though
she
was
impotent
to
stop
it
and
georgie
knew
just
what
she
felt
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
that
lucia
schemes
were
entirely
in
accord
with
the
purposes
of
the
guides
that
might
be
so
but
mrs
quantock
would
not
cease
to
think
that
she
had
been
robbed
yet
nothing
mattered
if
all
the
class
found
themselves
getting
young
and
active
and
loving
and
excellent
under
this
tuition
it
was
that
notion
which
had
taken
such
entire
command
of
them
all
and
for
his
part
georgie
did
not
really
care
who
owned
the
guru
so
to
speak
if
only
he
got
the
benefit
of
his
teachings
for
social
purposes
lucia
had
annexed
him
and
doubtless
with
him
in
the
house
she
could
get
little
instructions
and
hints
that
would
not
count
as
a
lesson
but
after
all
georgie
had
still
got
olga
bracely
to
himself
for
he
had
not
breathed
a
word
of
her
advent
to
lucia
he
felt
rather
like
one
who
when
revolutionary
ideas
are
in
the
air
had
concealed
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
formulate
to
himself
precisely
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
but
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
power
to
know
it
was
there
the
train
came
in
but
he
looked
in
vain
for
his
sisters
they
had
distinctly
said
they
were
arriving
by
it
but
in
a
couple
of
minutes
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
they
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
for
the
only
person
who
got
out
was
mrs
weston
cook
who
as
all
the
world
knew
went
into
brinton
every
wednesday
to
buy
fish
at
the
rear
of
the
train
however
was
an
immense
quantity
of
luggage
being
taken
out
which
could
not
all
be
mrs
weston
fish
and
indeed
even
at
that
distance
there
was
something
familiar
to
georgie
about
a
very
large
green
which
was
dumped
there
perhaps
hermy
and
ursy
had
travelled
in
the
van
because
it
was
such
a
lark
or
for
some
other
tomboy
reason
and
he
went
down
the
platform
to
investigate
there
were
bags
of
golf
clubs
and
a
dog
and
portmanteaux
and
even
as
the
conviction
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
seen
some
of
these
objects
before
the
guard
to
whom
georgie
always
gave
when
he
travelled
by
this
train
presented
him
with
a
note
scrawled
in
pencil
it
ran
dearest
georgie
it
was
such
a
lovely
day
that
when
we
got
to
paddington
ursy
and
i
decided
to
bicycle
down
instead
so
for
a
lark
we
sent
our
things
on
and
we
may
arrive
tonight
but
probably
tomorrow
take
care
of
tiptree
and
give
him
plenty
of
jam
he
loves
it
yours
hermy
tipsipoozie
does
really
bite
it
only
his
fun
georgie
crumpled
up
this
odious
epistle
and
became
aware
that
tipsipoozie
a
lean
irish
terrier
was
regarding
him
with
peculiar
disfavour
and
shewing
all
his
teeth
probably
in
fun
in
pursuance
of
this
humorous
idea
he
then
darted
towards
georgie
and
would
have
been
extremely
funny
if
he
had
not
been
handicapped
by
the
bag
of
to
which
he
was
tethered
as
it
was
he
pursued
him
down
the
platform
towing
the
clubs
after
him
till
he
got
entangled
in
them
and
fell
down
georgie
hated
dogs
at
any
time
though
he
had
never
hated
one
so
much
as
tipsipoozie
and
the
problems
of
life
became
more
complicated
than
ever
certainly
he
was
not
going
to
drive
back
with
tipsipoozie
in
his
cab
and
it
became
necessary
to
hire
another
for
that
abominable
hound
and
the
rest
of
the
luggage
and
what
on
earth
was
to
happen
when
he
arrived
home
if
tipsipoozie
did
not
drop
his
fun
and
become
serious
foljambe
it
is
true
liked
dogs
so
perhaps
dogs
liked
her
but
it
is
most
tarsome
of
hermy
thought
georgie
bitterly
i
wonder
what
the
guru
would
do
there
ensued
a
very
trying
ten
minutes
in
which
the
the
porters
georgie
and
mrs
weston
maid
all
called
tipsipoozie
a
good
dog
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
snapping
promiscuously
at
those
who
praised
him
eventually
a
valiant
porter
picked
up
the
bag
of
clubs
and
by
holding
them
out
in
front
of
him
at
the
extreme
length
of
his
arms
in
the
manner
of
a
fishing
rod
with
tipsipoozie
on
a
short
chain
at
the
other
end
of
the
bag
like
a
savage
fish
cursing
and
swearing
managed
to
propel
him
into
the
cab
and
there
was
another
gone
georgie
thereupon
got
into
his
cab
and
sped
homewards
in
order
to
arrive
there
first
and
consult
with
foljambe
foljambe
usually
thought
of
something
foljambe
came
out
at
the
noise
of
the
arriving
wheels
and
georgie
explained
the
absence
of
his
sisters
and
the
advent
of
an
atrocious
dog
he
very
fierce
he
said
but
he
likes
jam
foljambe
gave
that
supreme
smile
which
sometimes
georgie
resented
now
he
hailed
it
as
if
it
was
an
smile
i
see
to
him
sir
she
said
i
brought
up
your
tea
but
you
take
care
foljambe
wo
you
he
asked
i
expect
he
better
take
care
returned
the
intrepid
woman
georgie
as
he
often
said
trusted
foljambe
completely
which
must
explain
why
he
went
into
his
shut
the
door
and
looked
out
of
the
window
when
the
second
cab
arrived
she
opened
the
door
put
her
arms
inside
and
next
moment
emerged
again
with
tipsipoozie
on
the
end
of
the
chain
making
extravagant
exhibitions
of
delight
then
to
georgie
horror
the
door
opened
and
in
came
tipsipoozie
without
any
chain
at
all
rapidly
sending
a
message
of
love
in
all
directions
like
a
call
georgie
put
a
small
chair
in
front
of
him
to
shield
his
legs
tipsipoozie
evidently
thought
it
was
a
game
and
hid
behind
the
sofa
to
rush
out
again
from
ambush
just
got
snappy
being
tied
to
those
remarked
foljambe
but
georgie
as
he
put
some
jam
into
his
saucer
could
not
help
wondering
whether
the
message
of
love
had
not
done
it
he
dined
alone
for
hermy
and
ursy
did
not
appear
and
had
a
great
polishing
of
his
afterwards
while
waiting
for
them
no
one
ever
felt
anxious
at
the
of
those
sisters
for
they
always
turned
up
from
their
or
their
golf
sooner
or
later
chiefly
later
in
the
highest
spirits
at
the
larks
they
had
had
with
amazingly
dirty
hands
and
prodigious
appetite
but
when
twelve
struck
he
decided
to
give
up
all
idea
of
their
appearance
that
night
and
having
given
tipsipoozie
some
more
jam
and
a
comfortable
bed
in
the
woodshed
he
went
upstairs
to
his
room
though
he
knew
it
was
still
possible
that
he
might
be
roused
by
wild
cooees
and
showers
of
gravel
at
his
window
and
have
to
come
down
and
minister
to
their
gross
appetites
the
prospect
seemed
improbable
and
he
soon
went
to
sleep
georgie
awoke
with
a
start
some
hours
later
wondering
what
had
disturbed
him
there
was
no
gravel
rattling
on
his
window
no
violent
ringing
of
bicycle
bells
nor
loud
genial
shouts
outraging
the
decorous
calm
of
riseholme
but
certainly
he
had
heard
something
next
moment
the
repeated
noise
sent
his
heart
leaping
into
his
throat
for
quite
distinctly
he
heard
a
muffled
sound
in
the
room
below
which
he
instantly
diagnosed
with
fatal
certainty
as
burglars
the
first
emotion
that
mingled
itself
with
the
sheer
terror
was
a
passionate
regret
that
hermy
and
ursy
had
not
come
they
would
have
thought
it
tremendous
larks
and
would
have
invented
some
wonderful
offensive
with
and
and
even
tipsipoozie
the
would
have
been
a
succour
in
this
crisis
and
why
oh
why
had
not
georgie
had
him
to
sleep
in
his
bedroom
instead
of
making
him
cosy
in
the
woodshed
he
would
have
let
tipsipoozie
sleep
on
his
lovely
blue
quilt
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
if
only
tipsipoozie
could
have
been
with
him
now
ready
to
have
fun
with
the
burglar
below
as
it
was
the
servants
were
in
the
attics
at
the
top
of
the
house
dicky
slept
out
and
georgie
was
all
alone
with
the
prospect
of
having
to
defend
his
property
at
risk
of
his
life
even
at
this
moment
as
he
sat
up
in
bed
blanched
with
terror
these
miscreants
might
be
putting
his
treasure
into
their
pockets
the
thought
of
the
faberge
cigarette
case
and
the
louis
xvi
snuff
box
and
the
queen
anne
which
he
had
inherited
all
these
years
made
even
life
seem
cheap
for
life
would
be
intolerable
without
them
and
he
sprang
out
of
bed
groped
for
his
slippers
since
until
he
had
made
a
plan
it
was
wiser
not
to
shew
a
light
and
shuffled
noiselessly
towards
the
door
chapter
six
the
felt
icy
to
fingers
already
frozen
with
fright
but
he
stood
firmly
grasping
it
ready
to
turn
it
noiselessly
when
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
the
first
expedient
that
suggested
itself
with
an
overpowering
sweetness
of
relief
was
that
of
locking
his
door
going
back
to
bed
again
and
pretending
that
he
had
heard
nothing
but
apart
from
the
sheer
cowardice
of
that
which
he
did
not
mind
so
much
as
nobody
else
would
ever
know
his
guilt
the
thought
of
the
burglar
going
off
quite
unmolested
with
his
property
was
intolerable
even
if
he
could
not
summon
up
enough
courage
to
get
downstairs
with
his
life
and
a
poker
in
his
hand
he
must
at
least
give
them
a
good
fright
they
had
frightened
him
and
so
he
would
frighten
them
they
should
not
have
it
all
their
own
way
and
if
he
decided
not
to
attack
them
or
him
he
could
at
least
thump
on
the
floor
and
call
out
burglars
at
the
top
of
his
voice
or
shout
charles
henry
thomas
as
if
summoning
a
bevy
of
stalwart
footmen
the
objection
to
this
course
however
would
be
that
foljambe
or
somebody
else
might
hear
him
and
in
this
case
if
he
did
not
then
go
downstairs
to
mortal
combat
the
knowledge
of
his
cowardice
would
be
the
property
of
others
beside
himself
and
all
the
time
he
hesitated
they
were
probably
filling
their
pockets
with
his
dearest
possessions
he
tried
to
send
out
a
message
of
love
but
he
was
totally
unable
to
do
so
then
the
little
clock
in
his
mantelpiece
struck
two
which
was
a
miserable
hour
sundered
so
far
from
dawn
though
he
had
lived
through
years
of
agony
since
he
got
out
of
bed
the
actual
passage
of
time
as
he
stood
frozen
to
the
was
but
the
duration
of
a
few
brief
seconds
and
then
making
a
tremendous
call
on
his
courage
he
felt
his
way
to
his
fireplace
and
picked
up
the
poker
the
tongs
and
shovel
rattled
treacherously
and
he
hoped
that
had
not
been
heard
for
the
essence
of
his
plan
though
he
had
yet
no
idea
what
that
plan
was
must
be
silence
till
some
awful
surprise
broke
upon
them
if
only
he
could
summon
the
police
he
could
come
rushing
downstairs
with
his
poker
as
the
professional
supporters
of
the
law
gained
an
entrance
to
his
house
but
unfortunately
the
telephone
was
downstairs
and
he
could
not
reasonably
hope
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
the
police
station
without
being
overheard
by
the
burglars
he
opened
his
door
with
so
masterly
a
movement
that
there
was
no
sound
either
from
the
hinges
nor
from
the
handle
as
he
turned
it
and
peered
out
the
hall
below
was
dark
but
a
long
pencil
of
light
came
from
the
drawing
room
which
showed
where
the
reckless
brutes
must
be
and
there
too
alas
was
his
case
of
treasures
then
suddenly
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
voice
speaking
very
low
and
another
voice
answered
it
at
that
georgie
heart
sank
for
this
proved
that
there
must
be
at
least
two
burglars
and
the
odds
against
him
were
desperate
after
that
came
a
low
cruel
laugh
the
unmistakable
sound
of
the
rattle
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
explosive
uncorking
of
a
bottle
at
that
his
heart
sank
even
lower
yet
for
he
had
read
that
cool
habitual
burglars
always
had
supper
before
they
got
to
work
and
therefore
he
was
about
to
deal
with
a
gang
of
professionals
also
that
explosive
uncorking
clearly
indicated
champagne
and
he
knew
that
they
were
feasting
on
his
best
and
how
wicked
of
them
to
take
their
unhallowed
meal
in
his
for
there
was
no
proper
table
there
and
they
would
be
making
a
dreadful
mess
over
everything
a
current
of
cool
night
air
swept
up
the
stairs
and
georgie
saw
the
panel
of
light
from
the
open
door
diminish
in
width
and
presently
the
door
shut
with
a
soft
thud
leaving
him
in
the
dark
at
that
his
desperation
seemed
pressed
and
concentrated
into
a
moment
of
fictitious
courage
for
he
unerringly
reasoned
that
they
had
left
the
window
open
and
that
perhaps
in
a
few
moments
now
they
would
have
finished
their
meal
and
with
bulging
pockets
would
step
forth
unchallenged
into
the
night
why
had
he
never
had
bolts
put
on
his
shutters
like
mrs
weston
who
lived
in
nightly
terror
of
burglars
but
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
for
it
was
impossible
to
ask
them
to
step
out
till
he
had
put
bolts
up
and
then
when
he
was
ready
begin
again
he
could
not
let
them
go
gorged
with
his
champagne
and
laden
with
his
treasures
without
reprisals
of
some
sort
and
keeping
his
thoughts
steadily
away
from
revolvers
and
clubs
and
sandbags
walked
straight
downstairs
threw
open
the
door
and
with
his
poker
grasped
in
his
shaking
hand
cried
out
in
a
faint
thin
voice
if
you
move
i
shall
fire
there
was
a
moment
of
dead
silence
and
a
little
dazzled
with
the
light
he
saw
what
faced
him
at
opposite
ends
of
his
chippendale
sofa
sat
hermy
and
ursy
hermy
had
her
mouth
open
and
held
a
bun
in
her
dirty
hands
ursy
had
her
mouth
shut
and
her
cheeks
were
bulging
between
them
was
a
ham
and
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
pot
of
marmalade
and
a
stilton
cheese
and
on
the
floor
was
the
bottle
of
champagne
with
two
brimming
bubbling
tea
cups
full
of
wine
the
cork
and
the
wire
and
the
they
had
with
some
show
of
decency
thrown
into
the
fireplace
hermy
put
down
her
bun
and
gave
a
great
shout
of
laughter
mouth
was
disgustingly
full
and
she
exploded
then
they
lay
back
against
the
arms
of
the
sofa
and
howled
georgie
was
very
much
vexed
upon
my
word
hermy
he
said
and
then
found
it
was
not
nearly
a
strong
enough
expression
and
in
a
moment
of
ungovernable
irritation
he
said
damn
it
all
hermy
showed
signs
of
recovery
first
and
as
georgie
came
back
after
shutting
the
window
could
find
her
voice
while
ursy
collected
small
fragments
of
ham
and
bread
which
she
had
partially
chewed
lord
what
a
lark
she
said
georgie
it
most
ripping
lark
ursy
pointed
to
the
poker
he
fire
if
we
move
she
cried
or
poke
the
fire
was
it
ask
another
screamed
hermy
oh
dear
he
thought
we
were
burglars
and
came
down
with
a
poker
brave
boy
it
positively
the
limit
have
a
drink
georgie
suddenly
her
eyes
grew
round
and
awestruck
and
pointing
with
her
finger
to
georgie
shoulder
she
went
off
into
another
yell
of
laughter
ursy
his
hair
she
said
and
buried
her
face
in
a
soft
cushion
naturally
georgie
had
not
put
his
hair
in
order
when
he
came
downstairs
for
nobody
thinks
about
things
like
that
when
he
is
going
to
encounter
burglars
and
there
was
his
bald
pate
and
his
long
tresses
hanging
down
one
side
it
was
most
annoying
but
when
an
irremediable
annoyance
has
absolutely
occurred
the
only
possible
thing
for
a
decent
person
to
do
is
to
take
it
as
lightly
as
possible
georgie
rose
gallantly
to
the
occasion
gave
a
little
squeal
and
ran
from
the
room
down
again
presently
he
called
out
and
had
a
heavy
fall
on
the
stairs
as
he
went
up
to
his
bedroom
there
he
had
a
short
argument
with
himself
it
was
possible
to
slam
his
door
go
to
bed
and
be
very
polite
in
the
morning
but
that
would
never
do
hermy
and
ursy
would
have
a
joke
against
him
forever
it
was
really
much
better
to
share
in
the
joke
identifying
himself
with
it
so
he
brushed
his
hair
in
the
orthodox
fashion
put
on
a
very
smart
and
came
tripping
downstairs
again
my
dears
what
fun
he
said
let
all
have
supper
but
let
move
into
the
where
there
a
table
and
i
get
another
bottle
of
wine
and
some
glasses
and
we
bring
tipsipoozie
in
you
naughty
girls
fancy
arriving
at
a
time
like
this
i
suppose
your
plan
was
to
go
very
quietly
to
bed
and
come
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
and
give
me
a
fine
surprise
tell
me
about
it
now
so
presently
tipsipoozie
was
having
his
marmalade
which
did
just
as
well
as
jam
and
they
were
all
eating
slices
off
the
ham
and
stuffing
them
into
split
buns
yes
we
thought
we
might
as
well
do
it
all
in
one
go
said
hermy
and
it
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
if
it
a
yard
and
then
it
was
so
late
when
we
got
here
we
thought
we
would
disturb
you
specially
as
the
window
was
bolted
bicycles
outside
said
ursy
they
just
have
to
be
out
at
grass
till
morning
oh
how
is
you
hope
he
behaved
like
the
good
little
tiptree
that
he
is
georgie
o
yes
we
made
great
friends
said
georgie
sketchily
he
was
wee
bit
upset
at
the
station
but
then
he
had
a
good
tea
with
his
uncle
georgie
and
played
hide
and
seek
rather
rashly
georgie
made
a
face
at
tiptree
the
sort
of
face
which
amuses
children
but
it
did
amuse
tiptree
who
made
another
face
in
which
teeth
played
a
prominent
part
said
hermy
carelessly
smacking
him
across
the
nose
always
hit
him
if
he
shows
his
teeth
georgie
pass
the
fizz
well
so
we
got
through
the
window
continued
ursy
and
golly
we
were
hungry
so
we
foraged
and
there
we
were
jolly
plucky
of
you
georgie
to
come
down
and
beard
us
real
sport
said
hermy
and
how
old
why
she
come
down
and
fight
us
too
georgie
guessed
that
hermy
was
making
a
humourous
allusion
to
foljambe
who
was
the
one
person
in
riseholme
whom
his
two
sisters
seemed
to
hold
in
respect
ursy
had
once
set
a
for
georgie
but
the
mixed
biscuits
and
brazil
nuts
had
descended
on
foljambe
instead
on
that
occasion
foljambe
girt
about
in
impenetrable
calm
had
behaved
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
trod
on
biscuits
and
brazil
nuts
without
a
smile
unaware
to
all
appearance
that
there
was
anything
whatever
crunching
and
exploding
beneath
her
feet
that
had
somehow
quelled
the
two
who
as
soon
as
she
left
the
room
again
swept
up
the
mess
and
put
the
uninjured
brazil
nuts
back
into
the
dessert
dish
it
would
never
do
if
foljambe
lost
her
prestige
and
was
alluded
to
by
some
outrageously
slangy
name
if
you
mean
foljambe
said
georgie
icily
it
was
because
i
think
it
worth
while
to
disturb
her
in
spite
of
their
ride
the
indefatigable
sisters
were
up
early
next
morning
and
the
first
thing
georgie
saw
out
of
his
bathroom
window
was
the
pair
of
them
practising
lifting
shots
over
the
ducking
pond
on
the
green
till
breakfast
was
ready
he
had
given
a
short
account
of
last
night
adventure
to
foljambe
when
she
called
him
omitting
the
episode
about
his
hair
and
her
disapproval
was
strongly
indicated
by
her
silence
then
and
the
studied
contempt
of
her
manner
to
the
sisters
when
they
came
in
to
breakfast
hullo
foljambe
said
hermy
we
had
a
rare
lark
last
night
so
i
understand
miss
said
foljambe
got
in
through
the
window
said
hermy
hoping
to
make
her
smile
indeed
miss
said
foljambe
have
you
any
orders
for
the
car
sir
oh
georgie
may
we
run
over
to
the
links
this
morning
asked
hermy
may
take
us
there
she
glanced
at
foljambe
to
see
whether
this
brilliant
wit
afforded
her
any
amusement
apparently
it
did
tell
dicky
to
be
round
at
ten
said
georgie
yes
sir
hurrah
said
ursy
come
too
foljambe
and
we
have
a
match
no
thank
you
miss
said
foljambe
and
sailed
from
the
room
looking
down
her
nose
golly
what
an
iceberg
said
hermy
when
the
door
was
quite
shut
georgie
was
not
sorry
to
have
the
morning
to
himself
for
he
wanted
to
have
a
little
quiet
practice
at
the
mozart
trio
before
he
went
over
to
lucia
at
eleven
the
hour
when
she
had
arranged
to
run
through
it
for
the
first
time
he
would
also
have
time
to
do
a
few
posturing
exercises
before
the
first
which
was
to
take
place
in
lucia
at
twelve
that
would
make
a
pretty
busy
morning
and
as
for
the
afternoon
there
would
be
sure
to
be
some
callers
since
the
arrival
of
his
sisters
had
been
expected
and
after
that
he
had
to
go
to
the
ambermere
arms
for
his
visit
to
olga
bracely
and
what
was
he
to
do
about
her
with
regard
to
lucia
already
he
had
been
guilty
of
disloyalty
for
lady
ambermere
had
warned
him
of
the
arrival
yesterday
and
he
had
not
instantly
communicated
that
really
great
piece
of
news
to
lucia
should
he
make
such
amends
as
were
in
his
power
for
that
omission
or
greatly
daring
should
he
keep
her
to
himself
as
mrs
quantock
so
fervently
wished
that
she
had
done
with
regard
to
the
guru
after
the
adventure
of
last
night
he
felt
he
ought
to
be
able
to
look
any
situation
in
the
face
but
he
found
himself
utterly
unable
to
conceive
himself
manly
and
erect
before
the
eyes
of
the
queen
if
she
found
out
that
olga
bracely
had
been
at
riseholme
for
the
day
of
her
and
that
georgie
knowing
it
and
having
gone
to
see
her
had
not
informed
the
court
of
that
fact
the
spirit
of
bolshevism
the
desire
to
throw
off
all
authority
and
act
independently
which
had
assailed
him
yesterday
returned
now
with
redoubled
force
if
he
had
been
perfectly
certain
that
he
would
not
be
found
out
there
is
no
doubt
he
would
have
kept
it
from
her
and
yet
after
all
what
was
the
glory
of
going
to
see
olga
bracely
and
perhaps
even
entertaining
her
here
if
all
riseholme
did
not
turn
green
with
jealousy
moreover
there
was
every
chance
of
being
found
out
for
lady
ambermere
would
be
at
the
garden
party
tomorrow
and
she
would
be
sure
to
wonder
why
lucia
had
not
asked
olga
then
it
would
come
out
that
lucia
did
know
of
that
eminent
presence
and
lady
ambermere
would
be
astonished
that
georgie
had
not
told
her
thus
he
would
be
in
the
situation
which
his
imagination
was
unable
to
face
although
he
had
thrown
the
drawing
room
door
open
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
announced
that
he
would
fire
with
his
poker
no
he
would
have
to
tell
lucia
when
he
went
to
read
the
mozart
trio
with
her
for
the
first
time
and
very
likely
she
would
call
on
olga
bracely
herself
though
nobody
had
asked
her
to
and
take
all
the
wind
out
of
georgie
sails
sickening
though
that
would
be
he
could
not
face
the
alternative
and
he
opened
his
copy
of
the
mozart
trio
with
a
sigh
lucia
push
and
shove
and
have
everything
her
own
way
anyhow
he
would
tell
her
that
olga
and
her
husband
were
dining
at
the
hall
tonight
he
would
not
even
tell
her
that
her
husband
name
was
shuttleworth
and
lucia
might
make
a
dreadful
mistake
and
ask
mr
and
mrs
bracely
that
would
be
jam
for
georgie
and
he
could
easily
imagine
himself
saying
to
lucia
my
dear
i
thought
you
must
have
known
that
she
had
married
mr
shuttleworth
and
kept
her
maiden
name
how
tarsome
for
you
they
are
so
touchy
about
that
sort
of
thing
georgie
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
treble
part
of
the
mozart
trio
lucia
always
took
the
treble
because
it
had
more
tune
in
it
though
she
pretended
that
she
had
not
georgie
fine
touch
which
made
the
bass
effective
as
he
let
himself
in
to
shakespeare
garden
a
few
minutes
before
the
appointed
time
lucia
must
have
seen
him
from
the
window
for
the
subdued
noise
of
the
piano
ceased
even
before
he
had
got
as
far
as
perdita
garden
round
the
sundial
and
she
opened
the
door
to
him
the
look
was
in
her
eyes
and
the
black
undulations
of
hair
had
encroached
a
little
on
her
forehead
but
after
all
others
besides
lucia
had
trouble
with
their
hair
and
georgie
only
sympathized
georgino
mio
she
said
it
is
all
being
so
wonderful
there
seems
a
new
atmosphere
about
the
house
since
my
guru
came
something
holy
and
peaceful
do
you
not
notice
it
delicious
said
georgie
inhaling
the
what
is
he
doing
now
meditating
and
preparing
for
our
class
i
do
hope
dear
daisy
will
not
bring
in
discordant
elements
oh
but
that
not
likely
is
it
said
georgie
i
thought
he
said
she
had
so
much
light
yes
he
did
but
now
he
is
a
little
troubled
about
her
i
think
she
did
not
want
him
to
go
away
from
her
house
and
she
sent
over
here
for
some
silk
pyjamas
belonging
to
her
husband
which
he
thought
she
had
given
him
but
robert
did
think
so
at
all
the
guru
brought
them
across
yesterday
after
he
had
left
good
thoughts
for
her
in
her
house
but
it
was
the
guides
who
wished
him
to
come
here
they
told
him
so
distinctly
it
would
have
been
very
wrong
of
me
not
to
do
as
they
said
she
gave
a
great
sigh
let
us
have
an
hour
with
mozart
she
said
and
repel
all
thought
of
discord
my
guru
says
that
music
and
flowers
are
good
influences
for
those
who
are
walkers
on
the
way
he
says
that
my
love
for
both
of
them
which
i
have
had
all
my
life
will
help
me
very
much
for
one
moment
the
mundane
world
obtruded
itself
into
the
calm
peace
any
news
in
particular
she
asked
i
saw
you
drive
back
from
the
station
yesterday
afternoon
for
i
happened
to
be
looking
out
of
the
window
in
a
little
moment
of
leisure
the
guru
says
i
work
too
hard
by
the
way
and
your
sisters
were
not
with
you
and
yet
there
were
two
cabs
and
a
quantity
of
luggage
did
they
not
come
georgie
gave
a
respectably
accurate
account
of
all
that
had
happened
omitting
the
fact
of
his
terror
when
first
he
awoke
for
that
was
not
really
a
happening
and
had
had
no
effect
on
his
subsequent
proceedings
he
also
omitted
the
adventure
about
his
hair
for
that
was
quite
extraneous
and
said
what
fun
they
had
all
had
over
their
supper
at
half
past
two
this
morning
i
think
you
were
marvellously
brave
georgie
said
she
and
most
good
natured
you
must
have
been
sending
out
love
and
so
were
full
of
it
yourself
and
that
casts
out
fear
she
spread
the
music
open
anything
else
she
asked
georgie
took
his
seat
and
put
his
rings
on
the
oh
yes
he
said
olga
bracely
the
you
know
and
her
husband
are
arriving
at
the
ambermere
arms
this
afternoon
for
a
couple
of
days
the
old
fire
kindled
no
exclaimed
lucia
then
they
be
here
for
my
party
tomorrow
fancy
if
she
would
come
and
sing
for
us
i
shall
certainly
leave
cards
today
and
write
later
in
the
evening
asking
her
i
have
been
asked
to
go
and
see
her
said
georgie
not
proudly
the
music
rest
fell
down
with
a
loud
slap
but
lucia
paid
no
attention
let
us
go
together
then
she
said
who
asked
you
to
call
on
her
lady
ambermere
said
he
when
she
was
in
here
yesterday
she
never
mentioned
it
to
me
but
she
would
certainly
think
it
very
odd
of
me
not
to
call
on
friends
of
hers
and
be
polite
to
them
what
time
shall
we
go
georgie
made
up
his
mind
that
wild
horses
should
not
drag
from
him
the
fact
that
olga
husband
name
was
shuttleworth
for
here
was
lucia
grabbing
at
his
discovery
just
as
she
had
grabbed
at
daisy
discovery
who
was
now
her
guru
she
should
call
him
mr
bracely
then
somewhere
about
six
do
you
think
said
he
inwardly
raging
he
looked
up
and
distinctly
saw
that
sharp
foxy
expression
cross
lucia
face
which
from
long
knowledge
of
her
he
knew
to
betoken
that
she
had
thought
of
some
new
plan
but
she
did
not
choose
to
reveal
it
and
the
that
will
do
beautifully
she
said
and
now
for
our
heavenly
mozart
you
must
be
patient
with
me
georgie
for
you
know
how
badly
i
read
how
difficult
it
looks
i
am
frightened
lucia
never
saw
such
a
dwefful
thing
to
read
and
it
had
been
those
very
bars
which
georgie
had
heard
through
the
open
window
just
now
georgie
is
much
more
dwefful
he
said
remembering
the
double
sharp
that
came
in
the
second
bar
georgie
fwightened
too
at
reading
it
and
he
gave
a
little
scream
cattivo
mozart
to
wite
anything
so
dwefful
diffy
it
was
quite
clear
at
the
class
this
morning
that
though
the
pupils
were
quite
interested
in
the
abstract
messages
of
love
which
they
were
to
shoot
out
in
all
directions
and
in
the
atmosphere
of
peace
with
which
they
were
to
surround
themselves
the
branch
of
the
subject
which
thrilled
them
to
the
marrow
was
the
breathing
exercises
and
contortions
which
if
persevered
in
would
give
them
youth
and
activity
faultless
digestions
and
indefatigable
energy
they
all
sat
on
the
floor
and
stopped
up
alternate
nostrils
and
held
their
breath
till
mrs
quantock
got
purple
in
the
face
and
georgie
and
lucia
red
and
expelled
their
breath
again
with
sudden
puffs
that
set
the
rushes
on
the
floor
quivering
or
with
long
quiet
exhalations
then
there
were
certain
postures
to
be
learned
in
one
of
which
entailing
the
bending
of
the
body
backwards
two
of
georgie
came
off
with
a
sharp
snap
and
he
felt
the
corresponding
member
of
his
braces
thus
violently
released
spring
up
to
his
shoulder
various
other
embarrassing
noises
issued
from
lucia
and
daisy
that
sounded
like
the
bursting
of
strings
and
tapes
but
everybody
pretended
to
hear
nothing
at
all
or
covered
up
the
report
of
those
explosions
with
coughings
and
clearings
of
the
throat
but
apart
from
these
discordances
everything
was
fairly
harmonious
indeed
so
far
from
daisy
introducing
discords
she
wore
a
fixed
smile
which
it
would
have
been
purely
cynical
to
call
superior
when
lucia
asked
some
amazingly
simple
question
with
regard
to
om
she
sighed
too
at
intervals
but
these
sighs
were
expressive
of
nothing
but
patience
and
resignation
till
lucia
ignorance
of
the
most
elementary
doctrines
was
enlightened
and
though
she
rather
pointedly
looked
in
any
direction
but
hers
and
appeared
completely
unaware
of
her
presence
she
had
not
after
all
come
here
to
look
at
lucia
but
to
listen
to
her
own
whatever
lucia
might
say
guru
at
the
end
lucia
with
her
look
emerged
you
might
say
in
a
dazed
condition
from
hearing
about
the
fastness
of
thibet
where
the
guru
had
been
in
commune
with
the
guides
whose
wisdom
he
interpreted
to
them
i
feel
such
a
difference
already
she
said
dreamily
i
feel
as
if
i
could
never
be
hasty
or
worried
any
more
at
all
do
you
experience
that
dear
daisy
yes
dear
said
she
i
went
through
all
that
at
my
first
lesson
did
i
guru
dear
i
felt
it
too
said
georgie
unwilling
not
to
share
in
these
benefits
and
surreptitiously
tightening
his
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
buttons
and
am
i
to
do
that
swaying
exercise
before
every
meal
yes
georgie
said
lucia
saving
her
guru
from
the
trouble
of
answering
five
times
to
the
right
and
five
times
to
the
left
and
then
five
times
backwards
and
forwards
i
felt
so
young
and
light
just
now
when
we
did
it
that
i
thought
i
was
rising
into
the
air
did
you
daisy
daisy
smiled
kindly
no
dear
that
is
levitation
she
said
and
comes
a
very
long
way
on
she
turned
briskly
towards
her
guru
will
you
tell
them
about
that
time
when
you
levitated
at
paddington
station
she
said
or
will
you
keep
that
for
when
mrs
lucas
gets
rather
further
on
you
must
be
patient
dear
lucia
we
all
have
to
go
through
the
early
stages
before
we
get
to
that
mrs
quantock
spoke
as
if
she
was
in
the
habit
of
levitating
herself
and
it
was
but
reasonable
in
spite
of
the
love
that
was
swirling
about
them
all
that
lucia
should
protest
against
such
an
attitude
humility
after
all
was
the
first
essential
to
progress
on
the
way
yes
dear
she
said
we
will
tread
these
early
stages
together
and
encourage
each
other
georgie
went
home
feeling
also
unusually
light
and
hungry
for
he
had
paid
special
attention
to
the
exercise
that
enabled
him
to
have
his
liver
and
digestive
organs
in
complete
control
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
devoting
his
mind
to
arriving
at
that
which
had
made
lucia
look
so
sharp
and
foxy
during
their
conversation
about
olga
bracely
he
felt
sure
that
she
was
meaning
to
steal
a
march
on
him
and
she
was
planning
to
draw
first
blood
with
the
and
as
likely
as
not
claim
her
for
her
own
with
the
same
odious
greed
as
she
was
already
exhibiting
with
regard
to
the
guru
all
these
years
georgie
had
been
her
faithful
servant
and
coadjutor
now
for
the
first
time
the
spirit
of
independence
had
begun
to
seethe
within
him
the
scales
were
falling
from
his
eyes
and
just
as
he
turned
into
shelter
of
his
he
put
on
his
spectacles
to
see
how
riseholme
was
getting
on
without
him
to
assist
at
the
morning
parliament
his
absence
and
mrs
quantock
would
be
sure
to
evoke
comment
and
since
the
yoga
classes
were
always
to
take
place
at
twelve
the
fact
that
they
would
never
be
there
would
soon
rise
to
the
level
of
a
mystery
it
would
of
course
begin
to
leak
out
that
they
and
lucia
were
having
a
course
of
eastern
philosophy
that
made
its
pupils
young
and
light
and
energetic
and
there
was
a
sensation
like
all
great
discoveries
the
solution
of
lucia
foxy
look
broke
on
him
with
the
suddenness
of
a
and
since
it
had
been
settled
that
she
should
call
for
him
at
six
he
stationed
himself
in
the
window
of
his
bathroom
which
commanded
a
perfect
view
of
the
village
green
and
the
entrance
to
the
ambermere
arms
at
five
he
had
brought
up
with
him
a
pair
of
with
the
intention
of
taking
them
to
bits
so
he
had
informed
foljambe
and
washing
their
lenses
but
he
did
not
at
once
proceed
about
this
merely
holding
them
ready
to
hand
for
use
hermy
and
ursy
had
gone
back
to
their
golf
again
after
lunch
and
so
callers
would
be
told
that
they
were
all
out
thus
he
could
wash
the
lenses
when
he
chose
to
do
so
uninterrupted
the
minutes
passed
on
pleasantly
enough
for
there
was
plenty
going
on
the
two
miss
antrobuses
frisked
about
the
green
jumping
over
the
stocks
in
their
playful
way
and
running
round
the
in
the
eternal
hope
of
attracting
colonel
boucher
attention
to
their
pretty
nimble
movements
for
many
years
past
they
had
tried
to
gain
serious
attention
without
any
result
and
lately
they
had
turned
to
colonel
boucher
there
was
mrs
antrobus
there
too
with
her
face
and
her
and
mrs
weston
was
being
pushed
round
and
round
the
asphalt
path
below
the
elms
in
her
she
hated
going
slow
and
her
gardener
and
his
boy
took
turns
with
her
during
her
hour
carriage
exercise
and
propelled
her
amid
streams
of
perspiration
at
a
steady
four
miles
an
hour
as
she
passed
mrs
antrobus
she
shouted
something
at
her
and
mrs
antrobus
returned
her
reply
when
next
she
came
round
suddenly
all
these
interesting
objects
vanished
completely
from
georgie
ken
for
his
dark
suspicions
were
confirmed
and
there
was
lucia
in
her
hightum
hat
and
her
hightum
gown
making
her
gracious
way
across
the
green
she
had
distinctly
been
wearing
one
of
the
scrub
this
morning
at
the
class
so
she
must
have
changed
after
lunch
which
was
an
unheard
of
thing
to
do
for
a
mere
stroll
on
the
green
georgie
knew
well
that
this
was
no
mere
stroll
she
was
on
her
way
to
pay
a
call
of
the
most
formal
and
magnificent
kind
she
did
not
deviate
a
from
her
straight
course
to
the
door
of
the
arms
she
just
waggled
her
hand
to
mrs
antrobus
blew
a
kiss
to
her
sprightly
daughters
made
a
gracious
bow
to
colonel
boucher
who
stood
up
and
took
his
hat
off
and
went
on
with
the
inexorability
of
the
march
of
destiny
or
of
fate
knocking
at
the
door
in
the
immortal
fifth
symphony
and
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
note
through
his
glasses
georgie
could
see
it
quite
plainly
and
it
was
not
a
little
sheet
such
as
she
commonly
used
but
a
square
thick
envelope
she
disappeared
in
the
arms
and
georgie
began
thinking
feverishly
a
great
deal
depended
on
how
long
she
stopped
there
a
few
little
happenings
beguiled
the
period
of
waiting
mrs
weston
desisted
from
her
wild
career
and
came
to
anchor
on
the
path
just
opposite
the
door
into
the
arms
while
the
gardener
boy
sank
exhausted
on
to
the
grass
it
was
quite
easy
to
guess
that
she
proposed
to
have
a
chat
with
lucia
when
she
came
out
similarly
the
miss
antrobuses
who
had
paid
no
attention
to
her
at
all
before
ceased
from
their
pretty
gambolings
and
ran
up
to
talk
to
her
so
they
wanted
a
word
too
colonel
boucher
a
little
less
obviously
began
throwing
sticks
into
the
for
his
for
lucia
would
be
obliged
to
pass
the
and
mrs
antrobus
examined
the
stocks
very
carefully
as
if
she
had
never
seen
them
before
and
then
before
a
couple
of
minutes
had
elapsed
lucia
came
out
she
had
no
longer
the
note
in
her
hand
and
georgie
began
taking
his
to
bits
in
order
to
wash
the
lenses
for
the
present
they
had
served
their
purpose
she
has
left
a
note
on
olga
bracely
said
georgie
quite
aloud
so
powerful
was
the
current
of
his
thoughts
then
as
a
corollary
came
the
further
proposition
which
might
be
considered
as
proved
but
she
had
not
seen
her
the
justice
of
this
conclusion
was
soon
proved
for
lucia
had
hardly
disengaged
herself
from
the
group
of
her
subjects
and
traversed
the
green
on
her
way
back
to
her
house
when
a
motor
passed
bathroom
window
closely
followed
by
a
second
both
drew
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
ambermere
arms
with
the
speed
of
a
practised
optician
georgie
put
his
opera
glass
together
again
and
after
looking
through
the
wrong
end
of
it
in
his
agitation
was
in
time
to
see
a
man
get
out
of
the
second
car
and
hold
the
open
for
the
occupants
of
the
first
a
lady
got
out
first
tall
and
slight
in
figure
who
stood
there
unwinding
her
motor
veil
then
she
turned
round
again
and
with
a
thump
of
his
heart
that
surprised
georgie
with
its
violence
he
beheld
the
features
of
his
brunnhilde
swiftly
he
passed
into
his
bedroom
next
door
and
arrayed
himself
in
his
summer
hightums
a
fresh
almost
pearly
suit
of
white
duck
a
mauve
tie
with
an
amethyst
pin
in
it
socks
tightly
braced
up
of
precisely
the
same
colour
as
the
tie
so
that
an
imaginative
beholder
might
have
conjectured
that
on
this
warm
day
the
end
of
his
tie
had
melted
and
run
down
his
legs
buckskin
shoes
with
tall
slim
heels
and
a
straw
hat
completed
this
pretty
hightum
he
had
meant
to
wear
it
for
the
first
time
at
lucia
party
tomorrow
but
now
after
her
meanness
she
deserved
to
be
punished
all
riseholme
should
see
it
before
she
did
the
group
round
mrs
weston
chair
was
still
engaged
in
conversation
when
georgie
came
up
and
he
casually
let
slip
what
a
bore
it
was
to
pay
calls
on
such
a
lovely
day
but
he
had
promised
to
visit
miss
olga
bracely
who
had
just
arrived
so
there
was
another
nasty
one
for
lucia
since
now
all
riseholme
would
know
of
her
actual
arrival
before
lucia
did
and
who
mr
georgie
asked
mrs
antrobus
presenting
her
trumpet
to
him
in
the
manner
in
which
an
elephant
presents
its
trunk
to
receive
a
bun
who
was
that
with
her
oh
her
husband
mr
shuttleworth
said
georgie
they
have
just
been
married
and
are
on
their
honeymoon
and
if
that
was
not
another
staggerer
for
lucia
it
is
diffy
as
georgie
would
say
to
know
what
a
staggerer
is
for
lucia
would
be
last
of
all
to
know
that
this
was
not
mr
bracely
and
will
they
be
at
mrs
lucas
party
tomorrow
asked
mrs
weston
oh
does
she
know
them
asked
georgie
haw
haw
by
jove
began
colonel
boucher
very
handsome
woman
envy
you
my
boy
pity
it
their
honeymoon
haw
mrs
antrobus
trumpet
was
turned
in
his
direction
at
this
moment
and
she
heard
these
daring
remarks
naughty
she
said
and
georgie
the
envied
passed
in
into
the
inn
he
sent
in
his
card
on
which
he
had
thought
it
prudent
to
write
from
lady
ambermere
and
was
presently
led
through
into
the
garden
behind
the
building
there
she
was
tall
and
lovely
and
welcoming
and
held
out
a
most
cordial
hand
how
kind
of
you
to
come
and
see
us
she
said
georgie
this
is
mr
pillson
my
husband
how
do
you
do
mr
shuttleworth
said
georgie
to
shew
he
knew
though
his
own
christian
name
had
given
him
quite
a
start
for
the
moment
he
had
almost
thought
she
was
speaking
to
him
and
so
lady
ambermere
asked
you
to
come
and
see
us
olga
went
on
i
think
that
was
much
kinder
of
her
than
to
ask
us
to
dinner
i
hate
going
out
to
dinner
in
the
country
almost
as
much
as
i
hate
not
going
out
to
dinner
in
town
besides
with
that
great
hook
nose
of
hers
always
afraid
that
in
an
absent
moment
i
might
scratch
her
on
the
head
and
say
polly
is
she
a
great
friend
of
yours
mr
pillson
i
hope
so
because
everyone
likes
his
best
friends
being
laughed
at
up
till
that
moment
georgie
was
prepared
to
indicate
that
lady
ambermere
was
the
hand
and
he
the
glove
but
evidently
that
would
not
impress
olga
in
the
least
he
laughed
in
a
most
irreverent
manner
instead
do
let
us
go
she
went
on
georgie
ca
you
send
a
telegram
saying
that
we
have
just
discovered
a
subsequent
engagement
and
then
we
ask
mr
pillson
to
show
us
round
this
utterly
adorable
place
and
dine
with
us
afterwards
that
would
be
so
much
nicer
fancy
living
here
oh
and
do
tell
me
something
mr
pillson
i
found
a
note
when
i
arrived
half
an
hour
ago
from
mrs
lucas
asking
me
and
mr
shuttleworth
to
go
to
a
tomorrow
she
said
she
did
even
hope
that
i
should
remember
her
but
would
we
come
who
is
she
really
i
think
she
can
remember
me
very
well
if
she
thinks
i
am
mrs
bracely
georgie
says
i
must
have
been
married
before
and
that
i
have
caused
him
to
commit
bigamy
that
pleasant
conversation
for
a
honeymoon
is
it
who
is
she
oh
she
quite
an
old
friend
of
mine
said
georgie
though
i
never
knew
she
had
met
you
before
i
devoted
to
her
extremely
proper
but
now
tell
me
this
and
look
straight
in
my
face
so
that
i
shall
know
if
you
speaking
the
truth
should
i
enjoy
myself
more
wandering
about
this
heavenly
place
than
at
her
garden
party
georgie
felt
that
poor
lucia
was
really
punished
enough
by
this
time
you
will
give
her
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
if
you
go
he
began
ah
that
not
fair
it
is
hitting
below
the
belt
to
appeal
to
unselfish
motives
i
have
come
here
simply
to
enjoy
myself
go
on
eyes
front
the
candour
and
friendliness
of
that
beautiful
face
gave
georgie
an
impulse
of
courage
besides
though
no
doubt
in
fun
she
had
already
suggested
that
it
would
be
much
nicer
to
wander
about
with
him
and
dine
together
than
spend
the
evening
among
the
splendours
of
the
hall
i
got
a
suggestion
he
said
will
you
come
and
lunch
with
me
first
and
we
stroll
about
and
then
we
can
go
to
the
and
if
you
do
like
it
i
take
you
away
again
done
she
said
now
do
you
try
to
get
out
of
it
because
my
husband
is
a
witness
georgie
give
me
a
cigarette
in
a
moment
had
his
open
do
take
one
of
mine
he
said
i
georgie
too
you
do
say
so
let
send
it
to
the
psychical
research
or
whoever
those
people
are
who
collect
coincidences
and
say
it
spooks
and
a
match
please
one
of
you
georgies
oh
how
i
should
like
never
to
see
the
inside
of
an
opera
house
again
why
may
i
grow
on
the
walls
of
a
garden
like
this
or
better
still
why
should
i
have
a
house
and
garden
of
my
own
here
and
sing
on
the
and
ask
for
halfpennies
tell
me
what
happens
here
i
always
lived
in
town
since
the
time
a
hebrew
rather
like
lady
ambermere
took
me
out
of
the
gutter
my
dear
said
mr
shuttleworth
well
out
of
an
at
brixton
and
i
would
much
prefer
the
gutter
that
all
about
my
early
life
just
now
because
i
am
keeping
it
for
my
memoirs
which
i
shall
write
when
my
voice
becomes
a
little
more
like
a
but
do
tell
lady
ambermere
for
she
would
have
a
fit
but
say
you
happen
to
know
that
i
belong
to
the
surrey
bracelys
so
i
do
brixton
is
on
the
surrey
side
oh
my
dear
look
at
the
sun
it
behaving
like
the
best
sort
of
claude
heile
sonne
i
heard
you
do
that
last
may
said
georgie
then
you
heard
a
most
performance
said
she
but
really
being
unlaced
by
that
thing
that
great
fat
profligate
beery
prussian
was
almost
too
much
for
me
and
the
duet
but
it
was
very
polite
of
you
to
come
and
i
will
do
better
next
time
siegfried
brunnhilde
siegfried
miaou
miaou
bring
on
the
next
lot
of
cats
darling
georgie
was
it
awful
and
you
had
proposed
to
me
only
the
day
before
i
was
absolutely
enchanted
said
yes
but
then
you
did
have
that
thing
breathing
beer
into
your
innocent
face
georgie
rose
the
first
call
on
a
stranger
in
riseholme
was
never
supposed
to
last
more
than
half
an
hour
however
much
you
were
enjoying
it
and
never
less
however
bored
you
might
be
and
he
felt
sure
he
had
already
exceeded
this
i
must
be
off
he
said
too
delightful
to
think
that
you
and
mr
shuttleworth
will
come
to
lunch
with
me
tomorrow
half
past
one
shall
we
say
excellent
but
where
do
you
live
just
across
the
green
shall
i
call
for
you
he
asked
certainly
not
why
should
you
have
that
bother
she
said
ah
let
me
come
with
you
to
the
and
perhaps
you
will
shew
me
from
there
she
passed
through
the
hall
with
him
and
they
stood
together
in
the
sight
of
all
riseholme
which
was
strolling
about
the
green
at
this
as
at
most
other
hours
instantly
all
faces
turned
round
in
their
direction
like
so
many
sunflowers
following
the
sun
while
georgie
pointed
out
his
particular
mulberry
tree
when
everybody
had
had
a
good
look
he
raised
his
hat
a
then
she
said
so
many
thanks
and
quite
distinctly
she
kissed
her
hand
to
him
as
he
turned
away
so
she
talks
italian
too
thought
georgie
as
he
dropped
little
crumbs
of
information
to
his
friends
on
his
way
to
his
house
domani
that
means
tomorrow
oh
yes
she
was
meaning
lunch
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
on
the
table
in
his
hall
there
was
one
of
lucia
commoner
kinds
of
note
merely
a
half
sheet
folded
together
in
her
own
manner
georgie
felt
that
it
was
scarcely
more
necessary
to
read
it
for
he
felt
quite
sure
that
it
contained
some
excuse
for
not
coming
to
his
house
at
six
in
order
to
call
on
mr
and
mrs
bracely
but
he
gave
a
glance
at
it
before
he
rolled
it
up
in
a
ball
for
tipsipoozie
to
play
with
and
found
its
contents
to
be
precisely
what
he
expected
the
excuse
being
that
she
had
not
done
her
practising
but
the
was
interesting
for
it
told
him
that
she
had
asked
foljambe
to
give
her
his
copy
of
siegfried
georgie
strolled
down
past
the
hurst
before
dinner
mozart
was
silent
now
but
there
came
out
of
the
open
windows
the
most
amazing
hash
of
sound
which
he
could
just
recognise
as
being
the
piano
arrangement
of
the
duet
between
brunnhilde
and
siegfried
at
the
end
he
would
have
been
dull
indeed
if
he
had
not
instantly
guessed
what
signified
chapter
seven
a
fresh
thrill
went
through
an
atmosphere
already
with
excitement
when
next
morning
all
lucia
friends
who
had
been
bidden
to
the
tightum
were
rung
up
on
the
telephone
and
informed
that
the
party
was
hightum
that
caused
a
good
deal
of
extra
work
because
the
tightum
robes
had
to
be
put
away
again
and
the
hightums
aired
and
brushed
and
valetted
but
it
was
well
worth
it
for
riseholme
had
not
the
slightest
difficulty
in
conjecturing
that
olga
bracely
was
to
be
among
the
guests
for
a
cultured
and
artistic
centre
the
presence
of
a
star
that
blazed
so
regally
in
the
very
zenith
of
the
firmament
of
art
absolutely
demanded
the
hightum
which
the
presence
of
poor
lady
ambermere
though
she
would
not
have
liked
that
had
been
powerless
to
bring
out
of
their
cupboards
and
these
delightful
anticipations
concentrated
themselves
into
one
point
of
joy
when
no
less
than
two
independent
observers
without
collusion
saw
the
either
entering
or
leaving
the
hurst
while
a
third
an
unmistakably
heard
the
tuning
of
the
piano
actually
going
on
it
was
thus
clear
to
all
penetrating
minds
that
olga
bracely
was
going
to
sing
it
was
further
known
that
something
was
going
on
between
her
and
georgie
for
she
had
been
heard
by
one
miss
antrobus
to
ask
for
georgie
number
at
the
telephone
in
the
ambermere
arms
etiquette
forbade
her
actually
to
listen
to
what
passed
but
she
could
not
help
hearing
olga
laugh
at
something
presumably
that
georgie
said
he
himself
took
no
part
in
the
that
morning
but
had
been
seen
to
dash
into
the
fruiterer
and
out
again
before
he
went
in
a
great
hurry
to
the
hurst
shortly
after
classes
on
eastern
philosophy
under
the
tuition
of
mrs
quantock
indian
were
already
beginning
to
be
hinted
at
but
today
in
the
breathless
excitement
about
the
nobody
cared
about
that
they
might
all
have
been
taking
lessons
in
cannibalism
and
nobody
would
have
been
interested
finally
about
one
one
of
the
motors
in
which
the
party
had
arrived
yesterday
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
ambermere
arms
and
presently
mr
bracely
no
dear
mr
shuttleworth
got
in
and
drove
off
alone
that
was
very
odd
conduct
in
a
bridegroom
and
it
was
hoped
that
there
had
been
no
quarrel
olga
had
of
course
been
given
no
directions
as
to
hightum
or
tightum
and
when
she
walked
across
to
georgie
house
shortly
after
one
only
mrs
weston
who
was
going
back
home
to
lunch
at
top
speed
was
aware
that
she
was
dressed
in
a
very
simple
dark
blue
morning
frock
that
would
almost
have
passed
for
scrub
it
is
true
that
it
was
exceedingly
well
cut
and
had
not
the
look
of
having
been
rolled
up
in
a
ball
and
hastily
ironed
out
again
that
usually
distinguished
scrub
and
she
also
wore
a
string
of
particularly
fine
pearls
round
her
neck
the
sort
of
ornament
that
in
riseholme
would
only
be
seen
in
an
evening
hightum
even
if
anybody
in
riseholme
had
owned
such
things
lucia
not
long
ago
had
expressed
the
opinion
that
jewels
were
vulgar
except
at
night
and
for
her
part
she
wore
none
at
all
preferring
one
greek
cameo
of
uncertain
authenticity
georgie
received
olga
alone
for
hermy
and
ursy
were
not
yet
back
from
their
golf
it
is
good
of
you
to
let
me
come
without
my
husband
she
said
his
excuse
is
toothache
and
he
has
driven
into
brinton
i
very
sorry
said
georgie
you
need
be
for
now
i
tell
you
his
real
reason
he
thought
that
if
he
lunched
with
you
he
would
have
to
come
on
to
the
garden
party
and
that
he
was
absolutely
determined
not
to
do
you
were
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
in
fact
my
dear
what
a
delicious
house
all
panelled
with
that
lovely
garden
behind
and
croquet
may
we
play
croquet
after
lunch
i
always
try
to
cheat
and
if
i
found
out
i
lose
my
temper
georgie
wo
play
with
me
so
i
play
with
my
maid
this
georgie
will
said
he
how
nice
of
him
and
do
you
know
what
we
did
this
morning
before
the
toothache
did
begin
we
went
all
over
that
house
three
doors
away
which
is
being
done
up
it
belongs
to
the
proprietor
of
the
ambermere
arms
and
oh
i
wonder
if
you
can
keep
a
secret
yes
said
georgie
he
probably
had
never
kept
one
yet
but
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
begin
now
well
i
absolutely
determined
to
buy
it
only
i
dare
tell
my
husband
until
i
done
it
he
has
an
odd
nature
when
a
thing
is
done
settled
and
there
no
help
for
it
he
finds
it
adorable
but
he
also
finds
fatal
objections
to
doing
it
at
all
if
he
is
consulted
about
it
before
it
is
done
so
not
a
word
i
shall
buy
it
make
the
garden
furnish
it
down
to
the
minutest
detail
and
engage
the
servants
and
then
he
give
it
me
for
a
birthday
present
i
had
to
tell
somebody
or
i
should
burst
georgie
nearly
swooned
with
fervour
and
admiration
but
what
a
perfect
plan
he
said
you
really
like
our
little
riseholme
it
not
a
question
of
liking
it
a
mere
detail
of
not
being
able
to
do
without
it
i
do
like
breathing
but
i
should
die
if
i
did
i
want
some
delicious
lazy
backwater
sort
of
place
where
nothing
ever
happens
and
nobody
ever
does
anything
i
been
observing
all
the
morning
and
your
habits
are
adorable
nothing
ever
happens
here
and
that
will
precisely
suit
me
when
i
get
away
from
my
work
georgie
was
nearer
swooning
than
ever
at
this
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
when
she
talked
of
riseholme
being
a
lazy
backwater
and
almost
thought
she
must
have
been
speaking
of
london
where
as
lucia
had
acutely
observed
people
sat
in
the
park
all
morning
and
talked
of
each
other
affairs
and
spent
the
afternoon
at
and
danced
all
night
there
was
a
flippant
lazy
existence
but
she
was
far
too
much
absorbed
in
her
project
to
notice
his
stupefaction
but
if
you
breathe
a
word
she
said
everything
will
be
spoilt
it
has
to
burst
on
georgie
oh
and
there
another
in
your
garden
as
well
as
the
one
in
front
it
too
much
her
eyes
followed
foljambe
out
of
the
door
and
i
know
your
is
called
paravicini
or
grosvenor
she
said
no
she
is
foljambe
said
georgie
she
laughed
i
knew
i
was
right
she
said
it
practically
the
same
thing
oh
and
last
night
i
never
had
such
an
awful
evening
why
did
you
warn
me
and
my
husband
should
have
had
toothache
then
instead
of
this
morning
what
happened
asked
he
but
the
woman
insane
that
ambermere
parrot
i
mean
georgie
and
i
were
ten
minutes
late
and
she
had
a
jet
tiara
on
and
why
did
she
ask
us
to
dine
at
a
quarter
to
eight
if
she
meant
a
quarter
to
eight
instead
of
saying
they
were
actually
going
into
dinner
when
we
came
a
mournful
procession
of
three
men
and
three
whiskered
women
upon
which
the
procession
broke
up
as
if
we
had
been
the
riot
act
and
was
arranged
again
as
a
funeral
procession
and
georgie
with
lady
ambermere
was
the
hearse
we
dined
in
the
family
vault
and
talked
about
lady
ambermere
pug
she
talked
about
you
too
and
said
you
were
of
county
family
and
that
mrs
lucas
was
a
very
decent
sort
of
woman
and
that
she
herself
was
going
to
look
in
on
her
today
then
she
looked
at
my
pearls
and
asked
if
they
were
genuine
so
i
looked
at
her
teeth
and
there
was
no
need
to
ask
about
them
do
miss
out
a
moment
said
georgie
greedily
whenever
lady
ambermere
spoke
everybody
else
was
silent
i
grasp
that
at
first
for
no
one
had
explained
the
rules
so
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
waited
till
i
had
finished
then
she
went
on
again
precisely
where
she
had
left
off
then
when
we
came
into
the
drawing
room
the
whiskered
ladies
and
i
there
a
little
woman
like
a
mouse
sitting
there
and
nobody
introduced
her
so
naturally
i
went
to
talk
to
her
before
which
the
great
parrot
said
you
kindly
fetch
my
miss
lyall
and
miss
lyall
took
a
sack
out
of
the
corner
and
inside
was
the
sacred
carpet
and
then
i
waited
for
some
coffee
and
cigarettes
and
i
waited
and
i
waited
and
i
am
waiting
still
the
parrot
said
that
coffee
always
kept
her
awake
and
that
was
why
and
then
georgie
came
in
with
the
others
and
i
could
see
by
his
face
that
he
had
had
a
cigarette
either
it
was
then
nine
and
then
each
man
sat
down
between
two
women
and
pug
sat
in
the
middle
and
looked
for
fleas
then
lady
ambermere
got
up
and
came
across
the
charmed
circle
to
me
she
said
hope
you
have
brought
your
music
mrs
shuttleworth
kindly
open
the
piano
miss
lyall
it
was
always
considered
a
remarkably
fine
instrument
olga
waved
the
fork
on
which
was
impaled
a
piece
of
the
pineapple
which
georgie
had
purchased
that
morning
at
the
fruiterer
the
stupendous
cheek
she
said
i
thought
it
must
be
a
joke
and
laughed
with
the
greatest
politeness
but
it
was
you
hardly
believe
it
but
it
was
one
of
the
whiskered
ones
said
that
will
be
a
great
treat
and
another
put
on
the
face
that
everyone
wears
at
concerts
and
i
was
so
stunned
that
i
sang
and
lady
ambermere
beat
time
and
pug
barked
she
pointed
a
finger
at
georgie
never
till
the
day
of
judgment
she
said
when
lady
ambermere
gnashes
her
beautiful
teeth
for
ever
and
ever
will
i
set
foot
in
that
house
again
nor
she
in
my
house
i
will
set
fire
to
it
sooner
there
my
dear
what
a
good
lunch
you
have
given
me
may
we
play
croquet
at
once
lucia
were
scheduled
from
four
to
seven
and
before
the
earliest
guest
might
be
expected
she
was
casting
an
eagle
eye
over
the
preparations
which
today
were
on
a
very
sumptuous
scale
the
bowls
were
laid
out
in
the
bowling
alley
not
because
anybody
in
hightums
dresses
was
the
least
likely
to
risk
the
stooping
down
and
the
strong
movements
that
the
game
entailed
but
because
bowls
were
elizabethan
between
the
alley
and
the
lawn
nearer
to
the
house
was
a
large
marquee
where
the
commoner
crowd
though
no
crowd
could
be
really
common
in
riseholme
would
refresh
itself
but
even
where
none
are
common
there
may
still
be
degrees
in
rarity
and
by
the
side
of
this
general
refreshment
room
was
a
smaller
tent
carpeted
with
oriental
rugs
and
having
inside
it
some
chairs
and
two
seats
which
can
only
be
described
as
thrones
for
lady
ambermere
or
olga
bracely
while
lucia
guru
though
throneworthy
would
very
kindly
sit
in
one
of
his
most
interesting
attitudes
on
the
floor
this
tent
was
designed
only
for
high
converse
and
common
guests
if
they
were
good
would
be
led
into
it
and
introduced
to
the
great
presences
while
for
the
refreshment
of
the
presences
in
intervals
of
audience
a
more
elaborate
meal
with
peaches
and
four
sorts
of
sandwiches
was
laid
in
the
thus
those
guests
for
whom
audiences
were
not
provided
could
have
the
felicity
of
seeing
the
great
ones
pass
across
the
lawn
on
their
excursions
for
food
and
possibly
trip
over
the
croquet
hoops
which
had
been
left
up
to
give
an
air
of
naturalness
to
the
lawn
in
the
an
elzevir
or
two
were
left
negligently
open
as
if
mr
and
mrs
lucas
had
been
reading
the
works
of
persius
and
juvenal
when
the
first
guests
arrived
in
the
finally
which
was
not
usually
open
on
these
occasions
there
were
fresh
flowers
the
piano
too
was
open
and
if
you
had
not
seen
the
elzevirs
in
the
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
the
early
guests
if
they
penetrated
here
to
imagine
that
mrs
lucas
had
been
running
over
the
last
act
of
siegfried
a
minute
before
in
this
visit
of
final
inspection
lucia
was
accompanied
by
her
guru
for
he
was
part
of
the
domestic
and
she
wanted
him
to
be
discovered
in
the
special
tent
she
pointed
out
the
site
of
his
proposed
discovery
to
him
probably
the
first
person
i
shall
bring
in
here
she
said
will
be
lady
ambermere
for
she
is
noted
for
her
punctuality
she
is
so
anxious
to
see
you
and
would
it
not
be
exciting
if
you
found
you
had
met
before
her
husband
was
governor
of
madras
and
she
spent
many
years
in
india
madras
gracious
lady
asked
the
guru
i
too
know
madras
there
are
many
dark
spirits
in
madras
and
she
was
at
english
residency
yes
she
says
mr
kipling
knows
nothing
about
india
you
and
she
will
have
much
to
talk
about
i
wish
i
could
sit
on
the
floor
too
and
listen
to
what
you
say
to
each
other
it
will
be
great
treat
said
the
guru
thoughtfully
i
love
all
who
love
my
wonderful
country
suddenly
he
stopped
and
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
palms
outward
there
are
wonderful
vibrations
today
he
said
all
day
i
feel
that
some
word
is
on
way
from
the
guides
some
great
message
of
light
oh
would
it
be
wonderful
if
it
came
to
you
in
the
middle
of
my
garden
party
said
lucia
enthusiastically
ah
gracious
lady
the
great
word
comes
not
so
it
comes
always
in
solitude
and
quiet
gracious
lady
knows
that
as
well
as
guru
pure
guruism
and
social
struggled
together
in
lucia
guruism
told
her
that
she
ought
to
be
ecstatic
at
the
idea
of
a
great
message
coming
and
should
instantly
smile
on
his
desire
for
solitude
and
quiet
while
social
whispered
to
her
that
she
had
already
dangled
the
presence
of
a
mystic
from
benares
before
the
eyes
of
lady
ambermere
who
only
came
from
madras
on
the
other
hand
olga
bracely
was
to
be
an
even
more
resplendent
guest
than
either
lady
ambermere
or
the
guru
surely
olga
bracely
was
enough
to
set
this
particular
on
the
giddiest
of
pinnacles
and
an
awful
consequence
lurked
as
a
possibility
if
she
attempted
to
force
her
guru
not
to
immune
himself
in
solitude
and
quiet
which
was
that
conceivably
he
might
choose
to
go
back
to
the
pit
whence
he
was
digged
namely
the
house
of
poor
daisy
quantock
the
thought
was
intolerable
for
with
him
in
her
house
she
had
seen
herself
as
dispenser
of
eastern
mysteries
and
mistress
of
omism
to
riseholme
in
fact
the
guru
was
her
august
stunt
it
would
never
do
to
lose
him
before
the
end
of
july
and
rage
to
see
all
riseholme
making
pilgrimages
to
daisy
there
was
a
firmness
too
about
him
at
this
moment
she
felt
that
under
provocation
he
might
easily
defy
or
desert
her
she
felt
she
had
to
yield
and
so
decided
to
do
so
in
the
most
complete
manner
ah
yes
she
said
i
know
how
true
that
is
dear
guru
go
up
to
hamlet
no
one
will
disturb
you
there
but
if
the
message
comes
through
before
lady
ambermere
goes
away
promise
me
you
will
come
back
he
went
back
to
the
house
where
the
front
door
was
already
open
to
admit
lady
ambermere
who
was
telling
her
people
when
to
come
back
for
her
and
fled
with
the
heels
of
his
slippers
tapping
on
the
oak
stairs
up
to
hamlet
softly
he
shut
out
the
dark
spirits
from
madras
and
made
himself
even
more
secure
by
turning
the
key
in
his
door
it
would
never
do
to
appear
as
a
high
caste
brahmin
from
benares
before
anyone
who
knew
india
with
such
fatal
intimacy
for
he
might
not
entirely
correspond
with
her
preconceived
notions
of
such
a
person
lady
ambermere
arrival
was
soon
followed
by
that
of
other
guests
and
instead
of
going
into
the
special
tent
reserved
for
the
lions
she
took
up
a
commanding
position
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
where
she
could
examine
everybody
through
her
tortoiseshell
handled
lorgnette
she
kept
peppino
by
her
who
darted
forward
to
shake
hands
with
his
guests
and
then
darted
back
again
to
her
poor
miss
lyall
stood
behind
her
chair
and
from
time
to
time
as
ordered
gave
her
a
cape
or
put
up
her
parasol
or
adjusted
her
footstool
for
her
or
took
up
pug
or
put
him
down
as
her
patroness
required
most
of
the
time
lady
ambermere
kept
up
a
majestic
monologue
you
have
a
pretty
little
garden
here
mr
lucas
she
said
though
perhaps
inconveniently
small
your
croquet
lawn
does
not
look
to
me
the
full
size
and
then
there
is
no
but
i
think
you
have
a
little
strip
of
grass
somewhere
which
you
use
for
bowls
have
you
not
presently
i
will
walk
around
with
you
and
see
your
domain
put
pug
down
again
please
miss
lyall
and
let
him
run
about
see
he
wants
to
play
with
one
of
those
croquet
balls
put
it
in
motion
for
him
and
he
will
run
with
it
bless
me
who
is
that
coming
up
the
path
at
such
a
tremendous
speed
in
a
oh
i
see
it
is
mrs
weston
she
should
not
go
as
fast
as
that
if
pug
was
to
stray
on
to
the
path
he
would
be
run
over
better
pick
up
pug
again
miss
lyall
till
she
has
gone
by
and
here
is
colonel
boucher
if
he
had
brought
his
i
should
have
asked
him
to
take
them
away
again
i
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
miss
lyall
with
plenty
of
milk
in
it
and
not
too
strong
you
know
how
i
like
my
tea
and
a
biscuit
or
something
for
pug
with
a
little
cream
in
a
saucer
or
anything
that
handy
wo
you
come
into
the
and
have
tea
there
lady
ambermere
asked
peppino
the
asked
she
how
very
strange
to
lay
tea
in
a
peppino
explained
that
nobody
had
in
all
probability
used
the
to
smoke
in
for
five
or
six
years
oh
if
that
is
so
i
will
come
said
she
better
bring
pug
along
too
miss
lyall
there
is
a
i
am
glad
i
saw
it
or
i
should
have
stumbled
over
it
perhaps
oh
this
is
the
is
it
why
do
you
have
rushes
on
the
floor
put
pug
in
a
chair
miss
lyall
or
he
may
prick
his
paws
books
too
i
see
that
one
lying
open
is
an
old
one
it
is
latin
poetry
the
library
at
the
hall
is
very
famous
for
its
classical
literature
the
first
viscount
collected
it
and
it
numbers
many
thousands
of
volumes
indeed
it
is
the
most
wonderful
library
said
peppino
i
can
never
tear
myself
away
from
it
when
i
am
at
the
hall
i
do
not
wonder
i
am
a
great
student
myself
and
often
spend
a
morning
there
do
i
not
miss
lyall
you
should
have
some
new
glass
put
in
those
windows
mr
lucas
on
a
dark
day
it
must
be
very
difficult
to
see
here
by
the
way
your
good
wife
told
me
that
there
would
probably
be
a
very
remarkable
indian
at
her
party
a
brahmin
from
benares
she
said
i
should
like
to
have
a
talk
with
him
while
i
am
having
my
tea
kindly
prepare
a
peach
for
me
miss
lyall
peppino
had
heard
about
the
retirement
of
the
guru
in
consequence
of
a
message
from
the
guides
being
expected
and
proceeded
to
explain
this
to
lady
ambermere
who
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
as
she
was
looking
at
the
peaches
through
her
lorgnette
that
one
nearest
me
looks
eatable
she
said
and
then
i
do
not
see
miss
olga
bracely
though
i
distinctly
told
her
i
should
be
here
this
afternoon
and
she
said
mrs
lucas
had
asked
her
she
sang
to
us
yesterday
evening
at
the
hall
and
very
creditably
indeed
her
husband
mr
shuttleworth
is
a
cousin
of
the
late
lord
lucia
had
come
into
the
during
this
speech
and
heard
these
fatal
words
at
the
moment
she
would
gladly
have
recalled
her
invitation
to
olga
bracely
altogether
sooner
than
have
alluded
therein
to
mr
bracely
but
that
was
one
of
the
irremediable
things
of
life
and
since
it
was
no
use
wasting
regret
on
that
she
was
only
the
more
eager
for
olga
to
come
whatever
her
husband
name
was
she
braced
herself
up
to
the
situation
peppino
are
you
looking
after
lady
ambermere
she
said
dear
lady
ambermere
i
hope
they
are
all
taking
care
of
you
a
very
decent
peach
said
lady
ambermere
the
south
wall
of
my
garden
is
covered
with
them
and
they
are
always
of
a
peculiarly
delicious
flavour
the
hall
is
famed
for
its
peaches
i
understood
that
miss
bracely
was
going
to
be
here
mrs
lucas
i
can
not
imagine
what
makes
her
so
late
i
was
always
famed
for
my
punctuality
myself
i
have
finished
my
tea
the
lawn
outside
was
now
growing
thick
with
people
all
in
their
hightums
and
lady
ambermere
as
she
emerged
from
the
again
viewed
the
scene
with
marked
disfavour
the
two
miss
antrobuses
had
just
arrived
and
skipped
up
to
their
hostess
with
pretty
cries
we
are
dreadfully
late
said
the
eldest
but
it
was
all
fault
no
goosie
it
was
yours
said
the
other
how
can
you
be
so
naughty
as
to
say
it
was
mine
dear
mrs
lucas
what
a
lovely
party
it
being
and
may
we
go
and
play
bowls
lady
ambermere
regarded
their
retreating
backs
as
they
raced
off
with
arms
intertwined
to
the
bowling
green
and
who
are
those
young
ladies
she
asked
and
why
piggy
and
goosie
miss
lyall
do
not
let
pug
go
to
the
bowls
they
are
very
heavy
elsewhere
mrs
antrobus
was
slowly
advancing
from
group
to
group
with
her
trumpet
violently
engaged
in
receiving
refreshment
but
conversation
was
not
quite
so
varied
as
usual
for
there
was
an
attitude
of
intense
expectation
about
with
regard
to
the
appearance
of
miss
bracely
that
made
talk
rather
jerky
and
unconnective
then
also
it
had
gone
about
that
the
mysterious
indian
who
had
been
seen
now
and
then
during
the
last
week
was
actually
staying
with
mrs
lucas
and
why
was
he
not
here
more
unconjecturable
yet
though
not
so
thrillingly
interesting
was
the
absence
of
mr
georgie
what
could
have
happened
to
him
that
he
was
not
flitting
about
on
his
hostess
errands
and
being
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
it
was
in
vain
that
mrs
antrobus
plodded
on
her
methodical
course
seeking
answers
to
all
these
riddles
and
that
mrs
weston
in
her
swifter
progression
dashed
about
in
her
from
group
to
group
wherever
people
seemed
to
be
talking
in
an
animated
manner
she
could
learn
nothing
and
mrs
antrobus
could
learn
nothing
in
fact
the
only
information
to
be
had
on
the
subject
was
what
mrs
weston
herself
supplied
she
had
a
very
handsome
face
and
an
extremely
impressive
manner
as
if
she
was
imparting
information
of
the
very
highest
importance
she
naturally
spoke
in
a
loud
clear
voice
so
that
she
had
not
got
to
raise
it
much
even
when
she
addressed
mrs
antrobus
her
wealth
of
discursive
detail
was
absolutely
unrivalled
and
she
was
quite
the
best
observer
in
riseholme
the
last
i
saw
of
miss
bracely
she
said
exactly
as
if
she
had
been
told
to
describe
something
on
oath
in
the
was
a
little
after
one
today
it
must
have
been
after
because
when
i
got
home
it
was
close
on
a
quarter
to
two
and
i
was
a
hundred
yards
from
my
house
when
i
saw
her
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
said
to
my
gardener
boy
henry
luton
who
was
pushing
me
he
the
son
of
old
mrs
luton
who
kept
the
fish
shop
and
when
she
died
last
year
i
began
to
get
my
fish
from
brinton
for
i
did
fancy
the
look
of
the
new
person
who
took
on
the
business
and
henry
went
to
live
with
his
aunt
that
was
his
father
sister
not
his
mother
for
mrs
luton
never
had
a
sister
and
no
brothers
either
well
i
said
to
henry
can
go
a
bit
slower
henry
as
we
late
we
late
and
a
minute
or
two
more
does
make
any
difference
said
henry
touching
his
cap
so
we
went
slower
miss
bracely
was
just
opposite
the
then
and
presently
she
came
out
between
the
elms
she
had
just
an
ordinary
morning
frock
on
it
was
about
the
same
shade
as
your
cape
mrs
antrobus
or
perhaps
a
little
darker
for
the
sunshine
brightened
it
up
quite
simple
it
was
nothing
grand
and
she
looked
at
the
watch
on
her
wrist
and
she
seemed
to
me
to
walk
a
little
quicker
after
that
as
if
she
was
a
bit
late
just
as
i
was
but
slower
than
i
was
going
i
could
not
go
for
i
was
crawling
along
and
before
she
got
off
the
grass
i
had
come
to
the
corner
of
church
lane
and
though
i
turned
my
head
round
sharp
like
that
at
the
very
last
moment
so
as
to
catch
the
last
of
her
she
had
more
than
stepped
off
the
grass
onto
the
road
before
the
laurestinus
at
the
corner
of
colonel
boucher
garden
no
of
the
vicar
garden
hid
her
from
me
and
if
you
ask
me
mrs
weston
stopped
for
a
moment
nodding
her
head
up
and
down
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
what
she
had
said
and
to
raise
the
expectations
of
mrs
antrobus
to
the
highest
pitch
as
to
what
was
coming
and
if
you
ask
me
where
i
think
she
was
going
and
what
she
was
going
to
do
she
said
i
believe
she
was
going
out
to
lunch
and
that
she
was
going
to
one
of
those
houses
there
just
across
the
road
for
she
made
a
across
the
green
towards
them
well
there
are
three
houses
there
there
mrs
quantock
and
it
could
have
been
that
or
else
mrs
quantock
would
have
had
some
news
of
her
or
colonel
boucher
and
it
would
have
been
that
for
the
colonel
would
have
had
news
of
her
and
we
all
know
whose
the
third
house
just
there
is
mrs
antrobus
had
not
completely
followed
this
powerful
reasoning
but
colonel
boucher
and
mrs
quantock
are
both
here
eh
said
she
mrs
weston
raised
her
voice
a
little
that
what
i
saying
she
announced
but
who
is
here
whom
we
should
expect
to
see
and
where
his
house
it
was
generally
felt
that
mrs
weston
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
what
that
nail
precisely
was
no
one
knew
because
she
had
not
explained
why
both
olga
bracely
and
georgie
were
absentees
but
now
came
the
climax
bang
on
the
top
of
the
nail
a
shrewd
straight
stroke
so
there
she
was
having
her
lunch
with
mr
georgie
said
mrs
weston
now
introducing
this
name
for
the
first
time
with
the
highest
dramatic
art
and
they
would
be
seeing
round
his
house
afterwards
and
then
when
it
was
time
to
come
here
mr
georgie
would
have
remembered
that
the
party
was
hightum
not
tightum
and
there
was
miss
bracely
not
in
hightum
at
all
nor
even
tightum
in
my
opinion
but
scrub
no
doubt
she
said
to
him
it
a
very
grand
sort
of
party
mr
pillson
and
he
could
do
other
than
reply
for
we
all
received
notice
that
it
was
hightum
mine
came
about
twelve
he
could
do
other
than
reply
miss
bracely
it
is
gracious
me
she
would
say
i
only
got
this
old
rag
on
i
must
go
back
to
the
ambermere
arms
and
tell
my
maid
for
she
brought
a
maid
in
that
second
motor
and
tell
my
maid
to
put
me
out
something
tidy
that
will
be
a
great
bother
for
you
he
would
say
or
something
of
that
sort
for
i
do
pretend
to
know
what
he
actually
did
say
and
she
would
reply
mr
pillson
but
i
must
put
on
something
tidy
and
it
would
be
so
kind
of
you
if
you
would
wait
for
me
while
i
do
that
and
let
us
go
together
what
said
mrs
weston
made
a
sign
to
her
gardener
to
proceed
wishing
to
leave
the
stage
at
the
moment
of
climax
and
that
why
they
both
late
she
said
and
was
whirled
away
in
the
direction
of
the
the
minutes
went
on
and
still
nobody
appeared
who
could
possibly
have
accounted
for
the
whip
of
hightums
but
by
degrees
lucia
who
had
utterly
failed
to
decoy
lady
ambermere
into
the
place
of
thrones
began
to
notice
a
certain
thinning
on
her
lawns
her
guests
it
would
seem
were
not
in
process
of
dispersal
for
it
was
a
long
way
off
seven
yet
and
also
none
would
be
so
as
to
leave
without
shaking
hands
and
saying
what
a
delicious
afternoon
they
had
spent
but
certainly
the
lawns
grew
emptier
and
she
was
utterly
unable
to
explain
this
extraordinary
phenomenon
until
she
happened
to
go
close
to
the
windows
of
her
then
looking
in
she
saw
that
not
only
was
every
chair
there
occupied
but
people
were
standing
about
in
expectant
groups
for
a
moment
her
heart
beat
high
could
olga
have
arrived
and
by
some
mistake
have
gone
straight
in
there
it
was
a
dreamlike
possibility
but
it
burst
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
on
the
party
that
was
rapidly
becoming
a
nightmare
to
her
for
everyone
not
lady
ambermere
alone
was
audibly
wondering
when
the
guru
was
coming
and
when
miss
bracely
was
going
to
sing
at
the
moment
as
she
paused
a
window
in
the
was
opened
and
piggy
odious
head
looked
out
oh
mrs
lucas
she
said
goosie
and
i
have
got
beautiful
seats
and
mamma
is
quite
close
to
the
piano
where
she
will
hear
excellently
has
she
promised
to
sing
siegfried
is
mr
georgie
going
to
play
for
her
it
the
most
delicious
surprise
how
could
you
be
so
sly
and
clever
as
not
to
tell
anybody
lucia
cloaked
her
rage
under
the
most
playful
manner
as
she
ran
into
the
through
the
hall
you
naughty
things
she
said
do
all
come
into
the
garden
it
a
garden
party
and
i
could
guess
where
you
had
all
gone
what
all
this
about
singing
and
playing
i
know
nothing
of
it
she
herded
the
incredulous
crowd
out
into
the
garden
again
all
in
their
hightums
every
one
of
them
only
to
meet
lady
ambermere
with
pug
and
miss
lyall
coming
in
better
be
going
miss
lyall
she
said
kindly
run
out
and
find
my
people
oh
here
mrs
lucas
been
very
pleasant
indeed
thank
you
your
charming
garden
yes
oh
but
it
very
early
said
lucia
it
hardly
six
yet
indeed
said
lady
ambermere
been
so
charming
and
she
marched
out
after
miss
lyall
out
into
shakespeare
garden
it
was
soon
terribly
evident
that
other
people
were
sharing
lady
ambermere
conclusion
about
the
delights
of
the
afternoon
and
the
necessity
of
getting
home
colonel
boucher
had
to
take
his
for
a
run
and
walk
off
the
excitement
of
the
party
piggy
and
goosie
explained
to
their
mother
that
nobody
was
going
to
sing
and
by
silvery
laughter
tried
to
drown
her
just
indignation
and
presently
lucia
had
the
agony
of
seeing
mrs
quantock
seated
on
one
of
the
thrones
that
had
been
designed
for
much
worthier
ends
and
peppino
sitting
in
the
other
while
a
few
guests
drifted
about
the
lawn
with
all
the
purposelessness
of
autumn
leaves
what
with
the
guru
presumably
meditating
upstairs
still
and
with
olga
bracely
most
conspicuously
absent
she
had
hardly
nervous
energy
left
to
wonder
what
could
have
become
of
georgie
never
in
all
the
years
of
his
ministry
had
he
failed
to
be
at
her
elbow
through
the
entire
duration
of
her
flying
about
on
her
errands
like
a
tripping
hermes
herding
her
flocks
if
she
wanted
them
in
one
part
of
the
garden
rather
than
another
like
a
sagacious
and
coming
back
to
heel
again
ready
for
further
tasks
but
today
georgie
was
mysteriously
away
for
he
had
neither
applied
for
leave
nor
given
any
explanation
however
improbable
of
his
absence
he
at
least
would
have
prevented
lady
ambermere
the
only
cornerstone
of
the
party
from
going
away
in
what
must
be
called
a
huff
and
have
continued
to
tell
lucia
how
marvellous
she
was
and
what
a
beautiful
party
they
were
having
with
the
prospect
of
two
other
much
more
magnificent
cornerstones
lucia
had
not
provided
any
further
entertainment
for
her
guests
there
was
not
the
conjurer
from
brinton
nor
the
three
young
ladies
who
played
nor
even
the
mild
performing
doves
which
cooed
so
prettily
and
walked
up
their
mistress
outstretched
fingers
according
to
order
if
they
felt
disposed
there
was
nothing
to
justify
hightums
there
was
scarcely
even
sufficient
to
warrant
tightums
scrub
was
written
all
over
the
desert
dusty
face
it
was
about
six
when
the
miracles
began
and
without
warning
the
guru
walked
out
into
the
garden
probably
he
had
watched
the
departure
of
the
great
motor
with
its
chauffeur
and
footman
and
miss
lyall
and
lady
ambermere
and
pug
and
with
his
intuitive
sagacity
had
conjectured
that
the
danger
from
madras
was
over
he
wore
his
new
red
slippers
a
wonderful
turban
and
an
ecstatic
smile
lucia
and
daisy
met
him
with
cries
of
joy
and
the
remaining
guests
those
drifting
autumn
leaves
were
swept
up
as
it
were
by
some
compelling
broom
and
clustered
in
a
heap
in
front
of
him
there
had
been
a
great
message
a
word
of
might
full
of
love
and
peace
never
had
there
been
such
a
word
and
then
even
before
they
had
all
felt
the
full
thrill
of
that
once
more
the
door
from
the
house
opened
and
out
came
olga
bracely
and
georgie
it
is
true
that
she
had
still
her
blue
morning
frock
which
mrs
weston
had
designated
as
scrub
but
it
was
a
perfectly
new
scrub
and
if
it
had
been
completely
covered
with
paris
labels
they
would
not
have
made
its
one
whit
clearer
dear
mrs
lucas
she
said
mr
georgie
and
i
are
terribly
late
and
it
was
quite
my
fault
there
was
a
game
of
croquet
that
would
come
to
an
end
and
my
life
has
been
guided
by
only
one
principle
and
that
is
to
finish
a
game
of
croquet
whatever
happens
i
missed
six
trains
once
by
finishing
a
game
of
croquet
and
mr
georgie
was
so
unkind
he
would
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
or
let
me
change
my
frock
but
dragged
me
off
to
see
you
and
i
won
the
autumn
leaves
turned
green
and
vigorous
again
while
georgie
went
to
get
refreshment
for
his
conqueror
and
they
were
all
introduced
she
allowed
herself
to
be
taken
with
the
utmost
docility
how
unlike
somebody
into
the
tent
with
the
thrones
she
confessed
to
having
stood
on
tiptoe
and
looked
into
mrs
quantock
garden
and
wanted
to
see
it
so
much
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
this
garden
too
might
she
go
and
wander
all
over
this
garden
when
she
had
finished
the
most
delicious
peach
that
the
world
held
she
was
so
glad
she
had
not
had
tea
with
mr
georgie
he
would
never
have
given
her
such
a
good
peach
now
the
departing
guests
in
their
hightums
lingering
on
the
village
green
a
little
and
being
rather
sarcastic
about
the
utter
failure
of
lucia
party
could
hardly
help
seeing
georgie
and
olga
emerge
from
his
house
and
proceed
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
hurst
and
mrs
antrobus
who
retained
marvellous
eyesight
as
compensation
for
her
defective
hearing
saw
them
go
in
and
simultaneously
thought
that
she
had
left
her
parasol
at
the
hurst
next
moment
she
was
walking
thoughtfully
away
in
that
direction
mrs
weston
had
been
the
next
to
realize
what
had
happened
and
though
she
had
to
go
round
by
the
road
in
her
she
passed
mrs
antrobus
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
her
pretext
for
going
back
being
that
lucia
had
promised
to
lend
her
the
book
by
antonio
caporelli
or
was
it
caporelto
so
once
more
the
door
into
the
garden
opened
and
out
shot
mrs
weston
olga
by
this
time
had
made
her
tour
of
the
garden
and
might
she
see
the
house
she
might
there
was
a
pretty
at
this
stage
just
as
mrs
weston
was
poured
out
in
the
garden
as
with
the
floodgates
being
unopened
the
crowd
that
followed
her
came
surging
into
shakespeare
garden
and
never
had
the
mermaid
tail
behind
which
was
secreted
the
electric
bell
experienced
such
feverish
usage
pressure
after
pressure
invoked
its
aid
and
the
pretexts
for
were
soon
not
made
at
all
or
simply
disregarded
by
the
colonel
boucher
might
have
left
a
and
mrs
antrobus
an
ear
trumpet
or
miss
antrobus
piggy
a
shoe
lace
and
the
other
miss
antrobus
goosie
a
but
in
brisk
succession
the
guests
who
had
been
so
sarcastic
about
the
party
on
the
jostled
each
other
in
order
to
revisit
the
scenes
of
their
irony
miss
olga
bracely
had
been
known
to
enter
the
portals
and
as
many
of
them
who
entered
after
her
found
a
guru
as
well
olga
was
in
the
when
the
crowd
had
congested
the
hall
people
were
introduced
to
her
and
sank
down
into
the
nearest
chairs
mrs
antrobus
took
up
her
old
place
by
the
keyboard
of
the
piano
everybody
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
and
by
degrees
the
import
of
their
longing
was
borne
in
upon
olga
they
waited
and
waited
and
waited
much
as
she
had
waited
for
a
cigarette
the
evening
before
she
looked
at
the
piano
and
there
was
a
comfortable
murmur
from
her
audience
she
looked
at
lucia
who
gave
a
great
gasp
and
said
nothing
at
all
she
was
the
only
person
present
who
was
standing
now
except
her
hostess
and
mrs
weston
gardener
who
had
wheeled
his
chair
into
an
admirable
position
for
hearing
she
was
not
too
well
pleased
but
after
all
would
you
like
me
to
sing
she
asked
lucia
yes
ah
there
a
copy
of
siegfried
do
you
play
lucia
could
not
smile
any
more
than
she
was
smiling
already
is
it
very
diffy
she
asked
could
i
read
it
georgie
shall
i
try
she
slid
onto
the
me
to
begin
she
asked
finding
that
olga
had
opened
the
book
at
the
salutation
of
brunnhilde
which
lucia
had
practised
so
diligently
all
the
morning
she
got
no
answer
olga
standing
by
her
had
assumed
a
perfectly
different
aspect
for
her
gaiety
her
lightness
was
substituted
some
air
of
intense
concentrated
seriousness
which
lucia
did
not
understand
at
all
she
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
gathering
herself
in
and
paying
not
the
smallest
attention
to
lucia
or
anybody
else
one
two
said
lucia
three
now
and
she
plunged
wildly
into
a
sea
of
olga
had
just
opened
her
mouth
but
shut
it
again
no
she
said
once
more
and
she
whistled
the
motif
oh
it
so
diffy
said
lucia
beginning
again
georgie
turn
over
georgie
turned
over
and
lucia
counting
audibly
to
herself
made
an
incomparable
mess
all
over
the
piano
olga
turned
to
her
accompanist
shall
i
try
she
said
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
made
some
sort
of
sketch
of
the
accompaniment
simplifying
and
yet
retaining
the
essence
and
then
she
sang
chapter
eight
throughout
august
guruism
reigned
supreme
over
the
cultured
life
of
riseholme
and
the
priestess
and
dispenser
of
its
mysteries
was
lucia
never
before
had
she
ruled
from
so
elate
a
pinnacle
nor
wielded
so
secure
a
supremacy
none
had
access
to
the
guru
but
through
her
all
his
classes
were
held
in
the
and
he
meditated
only
in
hamlet
or
in
the
sequestered
arbour
at
the
end
of
the
laburnum
walk
once
he
had
meditated
on
the
village
green
but
lucia
did
not
approve
of
that
and
had
led
him
still
rapt
home
by
the
hand
the
classes
had
swelled
prodigiously
for
practically
all
riseholmites
now
were
at
some
stage
of
instruction
with
the
exception
of
hermy
and
ursy
who
pronounced
the
whole
thing
piffle
and
as
gentle
chaff
for
georgie
sometimes
stood
on
one
leg
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
and
held
their
breath
then
hermy
would
say
one
two
three
and
they
shouted
om
at
the
tops
of
their
discordant
voices
now
that
the
guru
was
practically
interned
in
the
hurst
they
had
actually
never
set
eyes
on
him
for
they
had
not
chosen
to
come
to
the
hightum
preferring
to
have
a
second
round
of
golf
and
meeting
lucia
next
day
had
been
distinctly
irreverent
on
the
subject
of
eastern
philosophy
since
then
she
had
not
been
aware
of
their
existence
lucia
now
received
special
instruction
from
the
guru
in
a
class
all
by
herself
so
prodigious
was
her
advance
in
yoga
for
she
could
hold
her
breath
much
longer
than
anybody
else
and
had
mastered
six
postures
while
the
next
class
which
she
attended
also
consisted
of
the
other
original
members
namely
daisy
quantock
georgie
and
peppino
they
had
got
on
very
well
too
but
lucia
had
quite
shot
away
from
them
and
now
if
the
guru
had
other
urgent
spiritual
claims
on
him
she
gave
instruction
to
a
less
advanced
class
herself
for
this
purpose
she
habited
herself
in
a
peculiarly
becoming
dress
of
white
linen
which
reached
to
her
feet
and
had
full
flowing
sleeves
like
a
surplice
it
was
girdled
with
a
silver
cord
with
long
tassels
and
had
buttons
and
a
hood
at
the
back
lined
with
white
satin
which
came
over
her
head
below
its
hem
as
she
sat
and
taught
in
a
really
rather
advanced
posture
showed
the
toes
of
her
white
morocco
slippers
and
she
called
it
her
teacher
robe
the
class
which
she
taught
consisted
of
colonel
boucher
piggy
antrobus
and
mrs
weston
sometimes
the
colonel
brought
his
with
him
who
lay
and
snorted
precisely
as
if
they
were
doing
breathing
exercises
too
a
general
air
of
joyful
mystery
and
spiritual
endeavour
blew
balmily
round
them
all
and
without
any
doubt
the
exercises
and
the
deep
breathing
were
extremely
good
for
them
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
the
month
georgie
was
sitting
in
his
garden
for
the
half
hour
before
thinking
how
busy
he
was
and
yet
how
extraordinarily
young
and
fresh
he
felt
usually
this
month
when
hermy
and
ursy
were
with
him
was
very
fatiguing
and
in
ordinary
years
he
would
have
driven
away
with
foljambe
and
dicky
on
the
day
after
their
departure
and
had
a
quiet
week
by
the
seaside
but
now
though
his
sisters
were
going
away
tomorrow
morning
he
had
no
intention
of
taking
a
rest
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
not
only
had
he
been
their
host
all
this
time
but
had
done
an
amazing
quantity
of
other
things
as
well
there
had
been
the
daily
classes
to
begin
with
which
entailed
much
work
in
the
way
of
meditation
and
exercises
as
well
as
the
actual
learning
and
also
he
had
had
another
job
which
might
easily
have
taxed
his
energies
to
the
utmost
any
other
year
for
olga
bracely
had
definitely
bought
that
house
without
which
she
had
felt
that
life
was
not
worth
living
and
georgie
all
this
month
had
at
her
request
been
exercising
a
supervision
over
its
decoration
and
furnishing
she
had
ordered
the
general
scheme
herself
and
had
sent
down
from
london
the
greater
part
of
the
furniture
but
georgie
was
commissioned
to
report
on
any
likely
pieces
of
old
stuff
that
he
could
find
and
if
expedition
was
necessary
to
act
on
his
own
responsibility
and
buy
them
but
above
all
secrecy
was
still
necessary
till
the
house
was
so
complete
that
her
georgie
might
be
told
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
riseholme
generally
was
in
a
state
of
prostration
following
on
the
violent
and
feverish
curiosity
as
to
who
had
taken
the
house
georgie
had
gone
so
far
as
to
confess
that
he
knew
but
the
most
pathetic
appeals
as
to
the
owner
identity
had
fallen
on
obdurate
if
not
deaf
ears
not
the
smallest
hint
would
he
give
on
the
subject
and
though
those
incessant
visits
to
the
house
those
searchings
for
furniture
the
bestowal
of
it
in
suitable
places
the
superintendence
of
the
making
of
the
garden
the
interviewings
of
paperhangers
plumbers
upholsterers
painters
carpenters
and
so
forth
occupied
a
great
deal
of
time
the
delicious
mystery
about
it
all
and
the
fact
that
he
was
doing
it
for
so
adorable
a
creature
rendered
his
exertions
a
positive
refreshment
another
thing
which
in
conjunction
with
this
and
his
studies
made
him
feel
younger
than
ever
was
the
discreet
arrival
and
perfect
success
of
his
toupet
no
longer
was
there
any
need
to
fear
the
dislocation
of
his
espaliered
locks
he
felt
so
secure
and
undetectable
in
that
regard
that
he
had
taken
to
wearing
no
hat
and
was
soon
about
to
say
that
his
hair
was
growing
more
thickly
than
ever
in
consequence
but
it
was
not
quite
time
for
that
yet
it
would
be
inartistic
to
suggest
that
just
a
couple
of
weeks
of
hatlessness
had
produced
so
desirable
a
result
as
he
sat
at
ease
after
the
labours
of
the
day
he
wondered
how
the
coming
of
olga
bracely
to
riseholme
would
affect
the
economy
of
the
place
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
her
with
her
beauty
her
charm
her
fame
her
personality
as
taking
any
second
place
in
its
life
unless
she
was
really
meaning
to
use
riseholme
as
a
retreat
to
take
no
part
in
its
life
at
all
it
was
hard
to
see
what
part
she
would
take
except
the
first
part
one
who
by
her
arrival
at
lucia
party
had
converted
it
in
a
moment
from
the
most
dire
of
scrubs
in
a
psychical
sense
to
the
hightumest
gathering
ever
known
could
not
lay
aside
her
distinction
and
never
had
lucia
scored
so
amazingly
as
over
olga
late
appearance
which
had
the
effect
of
bringing
back
all
her
departed
guests
with
the
compulsion
of
a
magnet
over
and
sending
up
the
whole
party
like
a
rocket
into
the
zenith
of
social
success
all
riseholme
knew
that
olga
had
come
after
playing
croquet
with
georgie
the
entire
afternoon
and
had
given
them
free
gratis
and
for
nothing
such
a
treat
as
only
the
wealthiest
could
obtain
with
the
most
staggering
fees
lady
ambermere
alone
driving
back
to
the
hall
with
pug
and
poor
miss
lyall
was
the
only
person
who
had
not
shared
in
that
and
she
knew
all
about
it
next
day
for
georgie
had
driven
out
on
purpose
to
tell
her
and
met
lucia
coming
away
how
then
would
the
advent
of
olga
affect
riseholme
social
working
generally
and
how
would
it
affect
lucia
in
particular
and
what
would
lucia
say
when
she
knew
on
whose
behalf
georgie
was
so
busy
with
plumbers
and
painters
and
with
buying
so
many
of
the
desirable
treasures
in
the
ambermere
arms
frankly
he
could
not
answer
these
conundrums
they
presupposed
inconceivable
situations
which
yet
though
inconceivable
were
shortly
coming
to
pass
for
olga
advent
might
be
expected
before
october
that
season
of
that
ushered
in
the
multifarious
gaieties
of
the
winter
would
olga
form
part
of
the
moonlit
circle
to
whom
lucia
played
the
first
movement
of
the
moonlight
sonata
and
give
a
long
sigh
at
the
end
like
the
rest
of
them
and
would
lucia
when
they
had
all
recovered
a
little
from
the
invariable
emotion
go
to
her
and
say
olga
mia
just
a
little
bit
out
of
the
valkyrie
it
would
be
so
pleasant
somehow
georgie
with
all
his
imagination
could
not
picture
such
a
scene
and
would
olga
take
the
part
of
second
citizenness
or
something
of
the
sort
when
lucia
played
portia
would
olga
join
the
elementary
class
of
yoga
and
be
instructed
by
lucia
in
her
teacher
robe
would
she
sing
treble
in
the
christmas
carols
while
lucia
beat
time
and
said
in
syllables
dictated
by
the
rhythm
trebles
a
little
flat
my
poor
ears
georgie
could
not
imagine
any
of
these
things
and
yet
unless
olga
took
no
part
in
the
social
life
of
riseholme
at
all
and
that
was
equally
inconceivable
what
was
the
alternative
true
she
had
said
that
she
was
coming
here
because
it
was
so
ideally
lazy
a
backwater
but
georgie
did
not
take
that
seriously
she
would
soon
see
what
riseholme
was
when
its
life
poured
down
in
spate
whirling
her
punt
along
with
it
and
finally
what
would
happen
to
him
when
olga
was
set
as
a
shining
star
in
this
firmament
already
he
revolved
about
her
he
was
aware
like
some
eager
delighted
little
moon
drawn
away
from
the
orbit
where
it
had
encircled
so
contentedly
by
the
more
potent
planet
and
the
measure
of
his
detachment
from
that
old
orbit
might
be
judged
precisely
by
the
fact
that
the
process
of
detachment
which
was
already
taking
place
was
marked
by
no
sense
of
the
pull
of
opposing
forces
at
all
the
great
new
star
sailing
into
the
heavens
had
just
picked
him
up
by
force
of
its
superior
power
of
attraction
even
as
by
its
momentary
conjunction
with
lucia
at
the
it
had
raised
her
to
a
magnitude
she
had
never
possessed
before
that
magnitude
was
still
lucia
and
no
doubt
would
be
until
the
great
star
appeared
again
then
without
effort
its
shining
must
surely
eclipse
every
other
illumination
just
as
without
effort
it
must
surely
attract
all
the
little
moons
to
itself
or
would
lucia
manage
somehow
or
other
either
by
sheer
force
of
will
by
desperate
and
hostile
endeavour
or
on
the
other
hand
by
some
supreme
tact
and
cleverness
to
harness
the
great
star
to
her
own
chariot
he
thought
the
desperate
and
hostile
endeavour
was
more
in
keeping
with
lucia
methods
and
this
quiet
evening
hour
represented
itself
to
him
as
the
lull
before
the
storm
the
actual
quiet
of
the
moment
was
suddenly
broken
into
his
banged
and
the
house
was
filled
with
running
footsteps
and
screams
of
laughter
but
it
was
not
uncommon
for
hermy
and
ursy
to
make
this
sort
of
entrance
and
at
the
moment
georgie
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
how
much
was
the
disturbance
of
the
tranquillity
he
but
drew
a
couple
of
long
breaths
said
om
once
or
twice
and
was
quite
prepared
to
find
his
deeper
calm
unshattered
hermy
and
ursy
ran
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
where
he
sat
still
yelling
with
laughter
and
still
georgie
imagination
went
no
further
than
to
suppose
that
one
of
them
had
laid
a
stymie
for
the
other
at
their
golf
or
driven
a
ball
out
of
bounds
or
done
some
other
of
these
things
that
appeared
to
make
the
game
so
diverting
to
them
georgie
you
never
guess
cried
hermy
the
guru
the
om
of
high
caste
and
extraordinary
sanctity
cried
ursy
the
brahmin
from
benares
shrieked
hermy
the
great
teacher
who
do
you
think
he
is
said
ursy
we
never
seen
him
before
but
we
recognised
him
at
once
he
recognised
us
too
and
did
he
run
into
the
hurst
and
shut
the
door
georgie
deeper
calm
suddenly
quivered
like
a
jelly
my
dears
you
need
howl
so
or
talk
quite
so
loud
he
said
all
riseholme
will
hear
you
tell
me
without
shouting
who
it
was
you
thought
you
recognised
there
no
think
about
it
said
hermy
it
was
one
of
the
cooks
from
the
calcutta
restaurant
in
bedford
street
where
we
often
have
lunch
said
ursy
he
makes
the
most
delicious
curries
especially
when
he
a
little
tipsy
said
hermy
and
is
about
as
much
a
brahmin
as
i
am
and
always
said
he
came
from
madras
we
always
tip
him
to
make
the
curry
himself
so
he
is
quite
ignorant
about
money
o
lord
said
hermy
wiping
her
eyes
if
it
is
the
limit
and
to
think
of
mrs
lucas
and
colonel
boucher
and
you
and
mrs
quantock
and
piggy
and
all
the
rest
of
them
sitting
round
a
cook
said
ursy
and
drinking
in
his
wisdom
mr
quantock
was
on
the
right
track
after
all
when
he
wanted
to
engage
him
georgie
with
a
fallen
heart
had
first
to
satisfy
himself
that
this
was
not
one
of
his
sisters
jokes
and
then
tried
to
raise
his
fallen
heart
by
remembering
that
the
guru
had
often
spoken
of
the
dignity
of
simple
manual
work
but
somehow
it
was
a
blow
if
hermy
and
ursy
were
right
to
know
that
this
was
a
tipsy
contriver
of
curry
there
was
nothing
in
the
simple
manual
office
of
that
could
possibly
tarnish
sanctity
but
the
amazing
tissue
of
falsehoods
with
which
the
guru
had
modestly
masked
his
innocent
calling
was
not
so
markedly
in
the
spirit
of
the
guides
as
retailed
by
him
it
was
of
the
first
importance
however
to
be
assured
that
his
sisters
had
not
at
present
communicated
their
upsetting
discovery
to
anybody
but
himself
and
after
that
to
get
their
promise
that
they
would
not
do
so
this
was
not
quite
so
easy
for
hermy
and
ursy
had
projected
a
round
of
visits
after
dinner
to
every
member
of
the
classes
with
the
exception
of
lucia
who
should
wake
up
next
morning
to
find
herself
the
only
illusioned
person
in
the
place
she
would
like
that
you
know
said
hermy
with
brisk
malice
we
thought
it
would
serve
her
out
for
never
asking
us
to
her
house
again
after
her
foolish
old
my
dear
you
never
wanted
to
go
said
georgie
i
know
we
did
but
we
rather
wanted
to
tell
her
we
did
want
to
go
she
was
nice
oh
i
do
think
we
can
give
up
telling
everybody
it
has
made
such
sillies
of
you
all
i
think
he
a
real
sport
so
do
i
said
ursy
we
shall
soon
have
him
back
at
his
again
what
a
laugh
we
shall
have
with
him
they
subsided
for
just
as
long
as
it
took
foljambe
to
come
out
of
the
house
inform
them
that
it
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
and
return
again
they
all
rose
obediently
well
we
talk
about
it
at
said
georgie
diplomatically
and
i
just
go
down
to
the
cellar
first
to
see
if
i
can
find
something
you
like
good
old
georgie
said
hermy
but
if
you
going
to
bribe
us
you
must
bribe
us
well
we
see
said
he
georgie
was
quite
right
to
be
careful
over
his
veuve
clicquot
especially
since
it
was
a
bottle
of
that
admirable
beverage
that
hermy
and
ursy
had
looted
from
his
cellar
on
the
night
of
their
burglarious
entry
he
remembered
that
well
though
he
had
chiefly
from
the
desire
to
keep
things
pleasant
about
his
hair
joined
in
the
fun
and
had
even
produced
another
but
tonight
even
more
than
then
there
was
need
for
the
abolition
of
all
petty
economies
for
the
situation
would
be
absolutely
intolerable
if
hermy
and
ursy
spread
about
riseholme
the
fact
that
the
introducers
and
innermost
circle
of
yoga
philosophers
had
sat
at
the
feet
of
no
gamaliel
at
all
but
at
those
of
a
from
some
low
restaurant
indeed
he
brought
up
a
second
bottle
tonight
with
a
view
if
hermy
and
ursy
were
not
softened
by
the
first
to
administer
that
also
they
would
then
hardly
be
in
a
condition
to
be
taken
seriously
if
they
still
insisted
on
making
a
visit
in
riseholme
and
tearing
the
veil
from
off
the
features
of
the
guru
georgie
was
far
too
upright
of
purpose
to
dream
of
making
his
sisters
drunk
but
he
was
willing
to
make
great
sacrifices
in
order
to
render
them
kind
what
the
inner
circle
would
do
about
this
cook
he
had
no
idea
he
must
talk
to
lucia
about
it
before
the
advanced
class
tomorrow
morning
but
anything
was
better
than
letting
hermy
and
ursy
loose
in
riseholme
with
their
rude
laughs
and
discreditable
exposures
this
evening
safely
over
he
could
discuss
with
lucia
what
was
to
be
done
for
hermy
and
ursy
would
have
vanished
at
as
they
were
going
in
for
some
at
a
safe
distance
lucia
might
recommend
doing
nothing
at
all
and
wish
to
continue
enlightening
studies
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
georgie
felt
that
the
romance
would
have
evaporated
from
the
classes
as
regards
himself
or
again
they
might
have
to
get
rid
of
the
guru
somehow
he
only
felt
quite
sure
that
lucia
would
agree
with
him
that
daisy
quantock
must
not
be
told
she
with
her
thwarted
ambitions
of
being
the
prime
dispenser
of
guruism
to
riseholme
might
easily
turn
nasty
and
let
it
be
widely
known
that
she
and
robert
had
seen
through
that
fraud
long
ago
and
had
considered
whether
they
should
not
offer
the
guru
the
situation
of
cook
in
their
household
for
which
he
was
so
much
better
qualified
she
might
even
add
that
his
leanings
towards
her
pretty
housemaid
had
alone
dissuaded
her
the
evening
went
off
with
a
success
more
brilliant
than
georgie
had
anticipated
and
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
open
the
second
bottle
of
champagne
hermy
and
ursy
perhaps
under
the
influence
of
the
first
perhaps
from
innate
perhaps
because
they
were
starting
so
very
early
next
morning
and
wanted
to
be
driven
into
brinton
instead
of
taking
a
slower
and
earlier
train
at
this
station
readily
gave
up
their
project
of
informing
the
whole
of
riseholme
of
their
discovery
and
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
they
had
rooked
their
brother
of
eleven
shillings
at
bridge
they
continued
to
say
i
play
the
guru
whenever
they
had
to
play
a
knave
but
georgie
found
it
quite
easy
to
laugh
at
that
so
long
as
the
humour
of
it
did
not
spread
he
even
himself
said
i
guru
you
then
when
he
took
a
trick
with
the
knave
of
trumps
the
agitation
and
uncertainty
caused
him
not
to
sleep
very
well
and
in
addition
there
was
a
good
deal
of
disturbance
in
the
house
for
his
sisters
had
still
all
their
packing
in
front
of
them
when
they
went
to
bed
and
the
doze
that
preceded
sleep
was
often
broken
by
the
sound
of
the
banging
of
luggage
the
clash
of
and
steps
on
the
stairs
as
they
made
ready
for
their
departure
but
after
a
while
these
disturbances
ceased
and
it
was
out
of
a
deep
sleep
that
he
awoke
with
the
sense
that
some
noise
had
awakened
him
apparently
they
had
not
finished
yet
for
there
was
surely
some
faint
stir
of
movement
somewhere
anyhow
they
respected
his
legitimate
desire
for
quiet
for
the
noise
whatever
it
was
was
extremely
stealthy
and
subdued
he
thought
of
his
absurd
lark
about
burglars
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
and
smiled
at
the
notion
his
was
in
a
drawer
close
to
his
bed
but
he
had
no
substantial
impulse
to
put
it
on
and
make
sure
that
the
noise
was
not
anything
other
than
his
sisters
preparations
for
their
early
start
for
himself
he
would
have
had
everything
packed
and
corded
long
before
dinner
if
he
was
to
start
next
day
except
just
a
suit
case
that
would
hold
the
apparatus
of
immediate
necessities
but
then
dear
hermy
and
ursy
were
so
ramshackle
in
their
ways
some
time
he
would
have
bells
put
on
all
the
shutters
as
he
had
determined
to
do
a
month
ago
and
then
no
sort
of
noise
would
disturb
him
any
more
the
next
morning
was
unusually
to
assemble
at
ten
since
peppino
who
would
not
miss
it
for
anything
was
going
to
have
a
fishing
in
the
happy
stream
that
flowed
into
the
avon
and
he
wanted
to
be
off
by
eleven
peppino
had
made
great
progress
lately
and
had
certain
curious
dizzy
symptoms
when
he
meditated
which
were
highly
satisfactory
georgie
breakfasted
with
his
sisters
at
eight
they
had
enticed
the
motor
out
of
him
to
convey
them
to
brinton
and
when
they
were
gone
foljambe
informed
him
that
the
housemaid
had
a
sore
throat
and
had
not
done
the
foljambe
herself
would
do
it
when
she
had
cleaned
the
young
ladies
rooms
there
was
a
hint
of
scorn
in
this
upstairs
and
so
georgie
sat
on
the
window
seat
of
the
and
thought
how
pleasant
peace
and
quietness
were
but
just
when
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
hurst
in
order
to
talk
over
the
disclosures
of
the
night
before
with
lucia
before
the
class
and
perhaps
to
frame
some
secretive
policy
which
would
obviate
further
exposure
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
his
the
pretty
straw
one
with
the
turquoise
in
the
corner
in
the
and
went
to
find
it
the
window
was
open
and
apparently
foljambe
just
come
in
to
let
fresh
air
into
the
atmosphere
which
hermy
and
ursy
had
so
uninterruptedly
contaminated
last
night
with
their
fags
as
they
called
them
but
his
was
not
on
the
table
where
he
thought
he
had
left
it
he
looked
round
and
then
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
his
of
treasures
was
not
only
open
but
empty
gone
was
the
louis
xvi
gone
was
the
miniature
of
karl
huth
gone
the
piece
of
bow
china
and
gone
the
faberge
cigarette
case
only
the
queen
anne
was
there
and
in
the
absence
of
the
others
it
looked
to
him
as
no
doubt
it
had
looked
to
the
burglar
indescribably
insignificant
georgie
gave
a
little
low
wailing
cry
but
did
not
tear
his
hair
for
obvious
reasons
then
he
rang
the
bell
three
times
in
swift
succession
which
was
the
signal
to
foljambe
that
even
if
she
was
in
her
bath
she
must
come
at
once
in
she
came
with
one
of
hermy
horrid
woolen
jerseys
that
had
been
left
behind
in
her
hand
yes
sir
what
is
it
she
asked
in
an
agitated
manner
for
never
could
she
remember
georgie
having
rung
the
bell
three
times
except
once
when
a
had
stuck
in
his
throat
and
once
again
when
a
note
had
announced
to
him
that
piggy
was
going
to
call
and
hoped
to
find
him
alone
for
answer
georgie
pointed
to
the
rifled
gone
burgled
he
said
oh
my
god
at
that
supreme
moment
the
telephone
bell
sounded
see
what
it
is
he
said
to
foljambe
and
put
the
queen
anne
in
his
pocket
she
came
hurrying
back
mrs
lucas
wants
you
to
come
around
at
once
she
said
i
ca
said
georgie
i
must
stop
here
and
send
for
the
police
nothing
must
be
moved
and
he
hastily
replaced
the
on
the
exact
circle
of
pressed
velvet
where
it
had
stood
before
yes
sir
said
foljambe
but
in
another
moment
she
returned
she
would
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
come
at
once
she
said
there
been
a
robbery
in
the
house
well
tell
her
there
been
one
in
mine
said
georgie
irritably
then
mixed
with
furious
curiosity
came
to
his
aid
wait
here
then
foljambe
on
this
very
spot
he
said
and
see
that
nobody
touches
anything
i
shall
probably
ring
up
the
police
from
the
hurst
admit
them
in
his
agitation
he
put
on
his
hat
instead
of
going
bareheaded
and
was
received
by
lucia
who
had
clearly
been
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
door
she
wore
her
teacher
robe
georgie
she
said
quite
forgetting
to
speak
italian
in
her
greeting
someone
broke
into
philip
safe
last
night
and
took
a
hundred
pounds
in
he
had
put
them
there
only
yesterday
in
order
to
pay
in
cash
for
that
cob
and
my
roman
pearls
georgie
felt
a
certain
pride
of
achievement
i
been
burgled
too
he
said
my
louis
xvi
is
worth
more
than
that
and
there
the
piece
of
bow
china
and
the
and
the
karl
huth
as
well
my
dear
come
inside
said
she
it
a
gang
and
i
was
feeling
so
peaceful
and
exalted
it
will
make
a
terrible
atmosphere
in
the
house
my
guru
will
be
profoundly
affected
an
atmosphere
where
thieves
have
been
will
stifle
him
he
has
often
told
me
how
he
can
not
stop
in
a
house
where
there
have
been
wicked
emotions
at
play
i
must
keep
it
from
him
i
can
not
lose
him
lucia
had
sunk
down
on
a
spacious
elizabethan
settle
in
the
hall
the
humorous
spider
mocked
them
from
the
window
the
humorous
stone
fruit
from
the
plate
beside
the
bowl
even
as
she
repeated
i
can
not
lose
him
again
a
tremendous
rap
came
on
the
front
door
and
georgie
at
a
sign
from
his
queen
admitted
mrs
quantock
robert
and
i
have
been
burgled
she
said
four
silver
spoons
thank
god
most
of
our
things
are
plate
eight
silver
forks
and
a
georgian
tankard
i
could
have
spared
all
but
the
last
a
faint
sign
of
relief
escaped
lucia
if
the
foul
atmosphere
of
thieves
permeated
daisy
house
too
there
was
no
great
danger
that
her
guru
would
go
back
there
she
instantly
became
sublime
peace
she
said
let
us
have
our
class
first
for
it
is
ten
already
and
not
let
any
thought
of
revenge
or
evil
spoil
that
for
us
if
i
sent
for
the
police
now
i
could
not
concentrate
i
will
not
tell
my
guru
what
has
happened
to
any
of
us
but
for
poor
peppino
sake
i
will
ask
him
to
give
us
rather
a
short
lesson
i
feel
completely
calm
om
vague
nightmare
images
began
to
take
shape
in
georgie
mind
unworthy
suspicions
based
on
his
sisters
information
the
evening
before
but
with
foljambe
keeping
guard
over
the
queen
anne
porringer
there
was
nothing
more
to
fear
and
he
followed
lucia
her
silver
cord
with
tassels
gently
swinging
as
she
moved
to
the
where
peppino
was
already
sitting
on
the
floor
and
breathing
in
a
rather
more
agitated
manner
than
was
usual
with
the
advanced
class
there
were
fresh
flowers
on
the
table
and
the
scented
morning
breeze
blew
in
from
the
garden
according
to
custom
they
all
sat
down
and
waited
getting
calmer
and
more
peaceful
every
moment
soon
there
would
be
the
tapping
of
slippered
heels
on
the
walk
of
broken
outside
and
for
the
time
they
would
forget
all
these
disturbances
but
they
were
all
rather
glad
that
lucia
was
to
ask
the
guru
to
give
them
a
shorter
lesson
than
usual
they
waited
presently
the
hands
of
the
cromwellian
timepiece
which
was
the
nearest
approach
to
an
elizabethan
clock
that
lucia
had
been
able
at
present
to
obtain
pointed
to
a
quarter
past
ten
my
guru
is
a
little
late
said
she
two
minutes
afterwards
peppino
sneezed
two
minutes
after
that
daisy
spoke
using
irony
would
it
not
be
well
to
see
what
has
happened
to
your
guru
dear
she
asked
have
you
seen
your
guru
this
morning
no
dear
said
lucia
not
opening
her
eyes
for
she
was
concentrating
he
always
meditates
before
a
class
so
do
i
said
daisy
but
i
have
meditated
long
enough
hush
said
lucia
he
is
coming
that
proved
to
be
a
false
alarm
for
it
was
nothing
but
lucia
persian
cat
who
had
a
quarrel
with
some
dead
laurel
leaves
lucia
rose
i
do
like
to
interrupt
him
she
said
but
time
is
getting
on
she
left
the
with
the
slow
supple
walk
that
she
adopted
when
she
wore
her
teacher
robes
before
many
seconds
had
passed
she
came
back
more
quickly
and
with
no
suppleness
his
door
is
locked
she
said
and
yet
there
no
key
in
it
did
you
look
through
the
keyhole
asked
mrs
quantock
with
irrepressible
irony
naturally
lucia
disregarded
this
i
knocked
she
said
and
there
was
no
reply
i
said
we
are
waiting
and
he
did
answer
suddenly
georgie
spoke
as
with
the
report
of
a
cork
flying
out
of
a
bottle
my
sisters
told
me
last
night
that
he
was
the
at
the
calcutta
restaurant
he
said
they
recognised
him
and
they
thought
he
recognised
them
he
comes
from
madras
and
is
no
more
a
brahmin
than
foljambe
peppino
bounded
to
his
feet
what
he
said
let
get
a
poker
and
break
in
the
door
i
believe
he
gone
and
i
believe
he
the
burglar
ring
for
the
police
is
he
said
daisy
robert
and
i
were
right
after
all
we
knew
what
your
guru
was
best
fitted
for
dear
lucia
but
then
of
course
you
always
know
best
and
you
and
he
have
been
fooling
us
finely
but
you
did
fool
me
i
knew
when
you
took
him
away
from
me
what
sort
of
a
bargain
you
had
made
guru
indeed
he
the
same
class
as
mrs
eddy
and
i
saw
through
her
fast
enough
and
now
what
are
we
to
do
for
my
part
i
shall
just
get
home
and
ring
up
for
the
police
and
say
that
the
indian
who
has
been
living
with
you
all
these
weeks
has
stolen
my
spoons
and
forks
and
my
georgian
tankard
guru
indeed
burglaroo
i
call
him
there
her
passion
like
hyperion
had
lifted
her
upon
her
feet
and
she
stood
there
defying
the
whole
of
the
advanced
class
short
and
stout
and
wholly
ridiculous
but
with
some
revolutionary
menace
about
her
she
was
not
exactly
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
but
she
was
terrible
as
an
elderly
lady
with
a
grievance
that
had
been
accentuated
by
the
loss
of
a
georgian
tankard
and
that
was
terrible
enough
to
make
lucia
adopt
a
conciliatory
attitude
bitterly
she
repented
having
stolen
daisy
guru
at
all
if
the
suspicions
now
thickening
in
the
air
proved
to
be
true
but
after
all
they
were
not
proved
yet
the
guru
might
still
walk
in
from
the
arbor
on
the
laburnum
alley
which
they
had
not
yet
searched
or
he
might
be
levitating
with
the
door
key
in
his
pocket
it
was
not
probable
but
it
was
possible
and
at
this
crisis
possibilities
were
things
that
must
be
clung
to
for
otherwise
you
would
simply
have
to
submerge
like
those
they
searched
all
the
garden
but
found
no
trace
of
the
they
made
guarded
enquiries
of
the
servants
as
to
whether
he
had
been
seen
but
nothing
whatever
could
be
learned
about
him
so
when
peppino
took
a
ponderous
hammer
and
a
stout
chisel
from
his
tool
chest
and
led
the
way
upstairs
they
all
knew
that
the
decisive
moment
had
come
perhaps
he
might
be
meditating
for
indeed
it
was
likely
that
he
had
a
good
deal
to
meditate
about
but
perhaps
peppino
called
to
him
in
his
most
sonorous
tones
and
said
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
break
his
lock
if
no
answer
came
and
presently
the
house
resounded
with
knockings
as
terrible
as
those
in
macbeth
and
much
louder
then
suddenly
the
lock
gave
and
the
door
was
open
the
room
was
empty
and
as
they
had
all
conjectured
by
now
the
bed
was
unslept
in
they
opened
the
drawers
of
the
wardrobe
and
they
were
as
empty
as
the
room
finally
peppino
unlocked
the
door
of
a
large
cupboard
that
stood
in
the
corner
and
with
a
clinking
and
crashing
of
glass
there
poured
out
a
cataract
of
empty
brandy
bottles
emptiness
that
was
the
of
the
whole
scene
and
blank
consternation
its
effect
my
brandy
said
mrs
quantock
in
a
strangled
voice
there
are
fourteen
or
fifteen
bottles
that
accounts
for
the
glazed
look
in
his
eyes
which
you
dear
lucia
thought
was
concentration
i
call
it
distillation
did
he
take
it
from
your
cellar
asked
lucia
too
shattered
to
feel
resentment
but
still
capable
of
intense
curiosity
no
he
had
a
standing
order
from
me
to
order
any
little
things
he
might
want
from
my
tradesmen
i
wish
i
had
my
bills
sent
in
every
week
yes
dear
said
lucia
georgie
eyes
sought
hers
i
saw
him
buy
the
first
bottle
he
said
i
remember
telling
you
about
it
it
was
at
rush
peppino
gathered
up
his
hammer
and
chisel
well
it
no
use
sitting
here
and
thinking
of
old
times
he
observed
i
shall
ring
up
the
and
put
the
whole
matter
into
their
hands
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
they
soon
lay
hands
on
him
and
he
can
do
his
postures
in
prison
for
the
next
few
years
but
we
do
know
that
it
was
he
who
committed
all
these
burglaries
yet
said
lucia
no
one
felt
it
was
worth
answering
this
for
the
others
had
all
tried
and
convicted
him
already
i
shall
do
the
same
said
georgie
my
tankard
said
mrs
quantock
lucia
got
up
peppino
mio
she
said
and
you
georgie
and
you
daisy
i
want
you
before
you
do
anything
at
all
to
listen
to
me
for
five
minutes
just
consider
this
what
sort
of
figure
shall
we
all
cut
if
we
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
police
they
will
probably
catch
him
and
it
will
all
come
out
that
we
have
been
the
dupes
of
a
think
what
we
have
all
been
doing
for
this
last
month
think
of
our
classes
our
exercises
our
everything
we
have
been
made
fools
of
but
for
my
part
i
simply
could
bear
that
everybody
should
know
i
had
been
made
a
fool
of
anything
but
that
what
a
hundred
pounds
compared
to
that
or
a
tankard
my
louis
xvi
was
worth
at
least
that
without
the
other
things
said
georgie
still
with
a
secret
satisfaction
in
being
the
greatest
sufferer
and
it
was
my
hundred
pounds
not
yours
said
peppino
but
it
was
clear
that
lucia
words
were
working
within
him
like
leaven
i
go
halves
with
you
she
said
i
give
you
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
and
who
would
like
to
go
halves
in
my
tankard
said
daisy
with
bitter
irony
i
want
my
tankard
georgie
said
nothing
but
his
mind
was
extremely
busy
there
was
olga
soon
coming
to
riseholme
and
it
would
be
awful
if
she
found
it
ringing
with
the
tale
of
the
guru
and
glancing
across
to
peppino
he
saw
a
thoughtful
and
sympathetic
look
in
his
eyes
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
his
mind
was
working
on
parallel
lines
certainly
lucia
had
given
them
all
something
to
meditate
upon
he
tried
to
imagine
the
whole
story
being
shouted
into
mrs
antrobus
on
the
and
could
not
endure
the
idea
he
tried
to
imagine
mrs
weston
ever
ceasing
to
talk
about
it
and
could
not
picture
her
silence
no
doubt
they
had
all
been
taken
in
too
but
here
in
this
empty
bedroom
were
the
original
dupes
who
encouraged
the
rest
after
mrs
quantock
enquiry
a
dead
silence
fell
what
do
you
propose
then
asked
peppino
showing
signs
of
surrender
lucia
exerted
her
utmost
wiles
caro
she
said
i
want
to
propose
daisy
and
me
we
silly
women
we
want
and
georgie
to
tell
us
what
to
do
but
if
lucia
must
speak
i
fink
she
paused
a
moment
and
observing
strong
disgust
at
her
playfulness
on
mrs
quantock
face
reverted
to
ordinary
english
again
i
should
do
something
of
this
sort
she
said
i
should
say
that
dear
daisy
guru
had
left
us
quite
suddenly
and
that
he
has
had
a
call
somewhere
else
his
work
here
was
done
he
had
established
our
classes
and
set
all
our
feet
upon
the
way
he
always
said
that
something
of
the
sort
might
happen
to
him
i
believe
he
had
planned
it
all
along
said
georgie
he
knew
the
thing
could
last
for
ever
and
when
my
sisters
recognised
him
he
concluded
it
was
time
to
bolt
with
all
the
available
property
he
could
lay
hands
on
said
mrs
quantock
lucia
fingered
her
tassel
now
about
the
burglaries
she
said
it
wo
do
to
let
it
be
known
that
three
burglaries
were
committed
in
one
night
and
that
simultaneously
daisy
guru
was
called
away
my
guru
indeed
said
mrs
quantock
fizzing
with
indignation
at
the
repetition
of
this
insult
that
might
give
rise
to
suspicion
continued
lucia
calmly
disregarding
the
interruption
and
we
must
stop
the
news
from
spreading
now
with
regard
to
our
burglary
let
me
think
a
moment
she
had
got
such
complete
control
of
them
all
now
that
no
one
spoke
i
have
it
she
said
only
boaler
knows
for
peppino
told
her
not
to
say
a
word
till
the
police
had
been
sent
for
you
must
tell
her
that
you
have
found
the
hundred
pounds
that
settles
that
now
you
georgie
foljambe
knows
said
georgie
then
tell
her
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
put
some
more
things
out
in
your
lovely
no
one
will
notice
and
you
daisy
robert
is
away
said
she
quite
meekly
for
she
had
been
thinking
things
over
my
maid
knows
and
when
he
comes
back
will
he
notice
the
loss
of
the
tankard
did
you
often
use
it
about
once
in
ten
years
chance
it
then
said
lucia
just
tell
your
maid
to
say
nothing
about
it
she
became
deliciously
modest
again
there
she
said
that
just
a
little
rough
idea
of
mine
and
now
peppino
and
georgie
will
put
their
wise
heads
together
and
tell
us
what
to
do
that
was
easily
done
they
repeated
what
she
had
said
and
she
corrected
them
if
they
went
wrong
then
once
again
she
stood
fingering
the
tassels
of
her
teacher
robe
about
our
studies
she
said
i
for
one
should
be
very
sorry
to
drop
them
altogether
because
they
made
such
a
wonderful
difference
to
me
and
i
think
you
all
felt
the
same
look
at
georgie
now
he
looks
ten
years
younger
than
he
did
a
month
ago
and
as
for
daisy
i
wish
i
could
trip
about
as
she
does
and
it
would
do
would
it
to
drop
everything
just
because
daisy
guru
i
mean
our
guru
had
been
called
away
it
would
look
as
if
we
were
really
interested
in
what
he
taught
us
as
if
it
was
only
the
novelty
of
having
a
a
brahmin
among
us
that
had
attracted
us
lucia
smiled
benignly
at
them
all
perhaps
we
shall
find
bye
and
bye
that
we
ca
progress
much
all
by
ourselves
she
said
and
it
will
all
drop
quietly
but
do
let
us
drop
it
with
a
bang
i
shall
certainly
take
my
elementary
class
as
usual
this
afternoon
she
paused
in
my
robe
just
as
usual
she
said
chapter
nine
the
fish
for
which
mrs
weston
sent
to
brinton
every
week
since
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
successor
to
tommy
luton
mother
lay
disregarded
on
the
dish
while
with
fork
and
in
her
hand
as
aids
to
gesticulation
she
was
recounting
to
colonel
boucher
the
complete
steps
that
had
led
up
to
her
remarkable
discovery
it
was
the
day
of
mrs
lucas
she
said
when
first
i
began
to
have
my
ideas
and
you
may
be
sure
i
kept
them
to
myself
for
i
not
one
to
speak
before
i
pretty
sure
but
now
if
the
king
and
queen
came
to
me
on
their
bended
knee
and
said
it
was
so
i
should
believe
them
well
as
you
may
remember
we
all
went
back
to
mrs
lucas
party
again
about
six
and
it
was
an
umbrella
that
one
had
left
behind
and
a
stick
that
another
had
forgotten
and
what
not
for
me
it
was
a
book
all
about
venice
that
i
wanted
to
borrow
most
interesting
i
am
sure
but
i
have
had
time
to
glance
at
it
yet
and
there
was
miss
bracely
just
come
mrs
weston
had
to
pause
a
moment
for
her
maid
elizabeth
luton
cousin
of
tommy
jogged
her
elbow
with
the
dishcover
in
a
manner
that
could
not
fail
to
remind
her
that
colonel
boucher
was
still
waiting
for
his
piece
of
brill
as
she
carved
it
for
him
he
rapidly
ran
over
in
his
mind
what
seemed
to
be
the
main
points
so
far
for
as
yet
there
was
no
certain
clue
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
preliminary
matter
he
guessed
either
guru
or
miss
bracely
then
he
received
his
piece
of
brill
and
mrs
weston
laid
down
her
carving
implements
again
you
better
help
yourself
said
elizabeth
discreetly
so
i
had
and
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
too
elizabeth
and
that
is
to
give
the
colonel
a
glass
of
wine
burgundy
i
was
only
wondering
this
afternoon
when
it
began
to
turn
chilly
if
there
was
a
bottle
or
two
of
the
old
burgundy
left
which
mr
weston
used
to
be
so
fond
of
and
there
was
he
bought
it
on
the
very
spot
where
it
was
made
and
he
said
there
was
a
headache
in
it
not
if
you
drank
it
all
night
he
never
did
for
a
couple
of
glasses
and
one
more
was
all
he
ever
took
so
i
do
know
how
he
knew
about
drinking
it
all
night
but
he
was
a
very
fine
judge
of
wine
so
i
said
to
elizabeth
bottle
of
the
old
burgundy
elizabeth
well
on
that
evening
i
stopped
behind
a
bit
to
have
another
look
at
the
guru
and
get
my
book
and
when
i
came
up
the
street
again
what
should
i
see
but
miss
bracely
walking
in
to
the
little
front
garden
at
place
it
was
getting
dark
i
know
and
my
eyes
are
like
mrs
antrobus
which
i
call
gimlets
but
i
saw
her
plain
enough
and
if
it
was
the
next
day
it
was
the
day
after
that
that
they
began
mending
the
roof
and
since
then
there
have
been
plumbers
and
painters
and
upholsterers
and
furniture
vans
at
the
door
day
and
night
haw
hum
said
the
colonel
then
do
you
mean
that
it
miss
bracely
who
has
taken
it
mrs
weston
nodded
her
head
up
and
down
i
shall
ask
you
what
you
think
when
i
told
you
all
she
said
well
there
came
a
day
and
if
today
friday
it
would
be
last
tuesday
fortnight
and
if
today
thursday
for
i
get
mixed
about
it
this
morning
and
then
i
never
get
it
straight
till
next
sunday
but
if
today
thursday
then
it
would
be
last
monday
fortnight
when
the
guru
went
away
very
suddenly
and
i
sure
i
was
very
sorry
because
those
breathings
made
me
feel
very
giddy
and
yet
i
did
like
to
be
out
of
it
all
mr
georgie
sisters
went
away
the
same
day
and
often
wondered
whether
there
was
any
connection
between
the
two
events
for
it
was
odd
their
happening
together
like
that
and
i
not
sure
we
heard
the
last
of
it
yet
colonel
boucher
began
to
wonder
whether
this
was
going
to
be
about
the
guru
after
all
and
helped
himself
to
half
a
partridge
this
had
the
effect
of
diverting
mrs
weston
attention
no
she
said
i
insist
on
your
taking
the
whole
bird
they
are
quite
small
and
i
was
disappointed
when
i
saw
them
plucked
and
a
bit
of
cold
ham
and
a
savoury
is
all
the
rest
of
your
dinner
mary
asked
me
if
i
would
have
an
apple
tart
as
well
but
i
said
the
colonel
never
touches
sweets
but
he
have
a
partridge
a
whole
partridge
i
said
he
wo
complain
of
his
dinner
well
on
the
day
that
they
all
went
away
whatever
the
explanation
of
that
was
i
was
sitting
in
my
chair
opposite
the
arms
when
out
came
the
landlord
followed
by
two
men
carrying
the
settle
that
stood
on
the
right
of
the
fireplace
in
the
hall
so
i
said
landlord
who
has
ordered
that
handsome
piece
for
handsome
it
was
with
its
carved
arms
and
he
said
morning
no
good
afternoon
it
would
be
it
for
miss
and
then
he
stopped
dead
and
corrected
himself
for
mr
pillson
mrs
weston
rapidly
took
a
great
quantity
of
mouthfuls
of
partridge
as
soon
as
possible
she
went
on
so
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
where
it
is
now
if
it
was
for
mr
georgie
she
said
i
was
there
only
two
days
ago
and
it
was
in
his
hall
or
in
his
dining
room
or
in
his
drawing
room
for
though
there
are
changes
there
that
settle
is
one
of
them
it
his
treasure
case
that
so
altered
the
is
gone
and
the
cigarette
case
and
the
piece
of
bow
china
and
instead
there
a
spoon
which
he
used
to
have
on
his
and
made
a
great
fuss
with
and
a
bit
of
worcester
china
that
used
to
stand
on
the
mantelpiece
and
a
different
cigarette
case
and
a
i
do
know
where
that
came
from
but
if
he
inherited
it
he
did
inherit
much
that
time
i
priced
it
at
five
shillings
but
there
no
settle
in
the
or
out
of
it
and
if
you
want
to
know
where
that
settle
is
it
in
old
place
because
i
saw
it
there
myself
when
the
door
was
open
as
i
passed
he
bought
it
mr
georgie
on
behalf
of
miss
bracely
unless
you
suppose
that
mr
georgie
is
going
to
live
in
old
place
one
day
and
his
own
house
the
next
no
it
miss
bracely
who
is
going
to
live
at
place
and
that
explains
the
landlord
saying
and
then
stopping
for
some
reason
and
i
daresay
that
wo
puzzle
me
long
now
i
can
give
my
mind
to
it
she
making
a
secret
about
it
and
only
mr
georgie
and
the
landlord
of
the
arms
know
of
course
he
had
to
for
is
his
and
i
wish
i
had
bought
it
myself
now
for
he
got
it
for
an
old
song
well
by
jove
you
have
pieced
it
together
finely
said
colonel
boucher
wait
a
bit
said
mrs
weston
rising
to
her
climax
this
very
day
when
mary
that
my
cook
as
you
know
was
coming
back
from
brinton
with
that
bit
of
brill
we
been
eating
for
they
had
got
an
ounce
of
turbot
which
i
wanted
a
was
standing
at
riseholme
station
and
they
had
just
taken
out
of
it
a
case
that
could
have
held
nothing
but
a
grand
piano
and
if
that
not
enough
for
you
colonel
there
were
two
big
as
well
which
i
think
must
have
contained
linen
for
they
were
corded
and
it
took
two
men
to
move
each
of
them
so
mary
said
and
there
nothing
so
heavy
as
linen
properly
packed
unless
it
plate
and
there
printed
on
them
in
black
no
it
would
be
white
because
the
are
black
were
two
initials
and
if
you
can
point
to
another
in
riseholme
i
shall
think
i
lost
my
memory
at
this
moment
of
supreme
climax
the
rang
in
the
hall
shrill
through
the
noise
of
cracking
walnuts
and
in
came
elizabeth
with
the
news
that
mr
georgie
wanted
to
know
if
he
might
come
in
for
and
chat
if
it
had
been
olga
bracely
herself
she
could
hardly
have
been
more
welcome
virtue
the
virtue
of
observation
and
inference
was
receiving
its
immediate
reward
delighted
say
i
delighted
elizabeth
said
mrs
weston
and
now
colonel
why
should
you
sit
all
alone
here
and
i
all
alone
in
the
drawing
room
bring
your
decanter
and
your
glass
with
you
and
you
shall
spare
me
half
a
glass
for
myself
and
if
you
ca
guess
what
one
of
the
questions
that
i
shall
ask
mr
georgie
is
well
georgie
made
haste
to
avail
himself
of
this
hospitality
for
he
was
bursting
with
the
most
important
news
that
had
been
his
since
the
night
of
the
burglaries
today
he
had
received
permission
to
let
it
be
known
that
olga
was
coming
to
old
place
for
mr
shuttleworth
had
been
informed
of
the
purchase
and
furnishing
of
the
house
and
had
as
expected
presented
his
wife
with
it
a
really
magnificent
gift
so
now
riseholme
might
know
too
and
georgie
as
eager
as
hermes
if
not
quite
so
swift
tripped
across
to
mrs
weston
on
his
delightful
errand
it
was
too
of
the
nature
of
just
such
a
punitive
expedition
as
georgie
thoroughly
enjoyed
for
lucia
all
this
week
had
been
rather
haughty
and
cold
with
him
for
his
firm
refusal
to
tell
her
who
the
purchaser
of
old
place
was
he
had
admitted
that
he
knew
but
had
said
that
he
was
under
promise
not
to
reveal
that
until
permitted
and
lucia
had
been
haughty
in
consequence
she
had
in
fact
been
so
haughty
that
when
georgie
rang
her
up
just
now
before
ringing
mrs
weston
up
to
ask
if
he
might
spend
an
hour
after
dinner
there
fully
intending
to
tell
her
the
great
news
she
had
replied
through
her
that
she
was
very
busy
at
the
piano
very
well
if
she
preferred
the
second
and
third
movements
of
the
moonlight
sonata
which
she
had
seriously
taken
in
hand
to
georgie
company
why
he
would
offer
himself
and
his
great
news
elsewhere
but
he
determined
not
to
bring
it
out
at
once
that
sort
of
thing
must
be
kept
till
he
said
it
was
time
to
go
away
then
he
would
bring
it
out
and
depart
in
the
blaze
of
success
he
had
brought
a
pretty
piece
of
embroidery
with
him
to
occupy
himself
with
for
his
work
had
fallen
into
sad
arrears
during
august
and
he
settled
himself
comfortably
down
close
to
the
light
so
that
at
the
cost
of
very
little
he
need
not
put
on
his
spectacles
any
news
he
asked
according
to
the
invariable
formula
mrs
weston
caught
the
colonel
eye
she
was
not
proposing
to
bring
out
her
tremendous
interrogation
just
yet
poor
mrs
antrobus
toothache
she
said
i
was
in
the
chemist
this
morning
and
who
should
come
in
but
miss
piggy
and
she
wanted
a
drop
of
laudanum
and
had
to
say
what
it
was
for
and
even
then
she
had
to
sign
a
paper
very
unpleasant
i
call
it
to
be
obliged
to
let
a
chemist
know
that
your
mother
has
a
toothache
but
there
it
was
tell
him
she
had
to
or
go
away
without
any
laudanum
i
do
know
whether
mr
doubleday
was
asking
more
than
he
should
just
out
of
inquisitiveness
for
i
do
see
what
business
it
is
of
his
i
know
what
i
should
have
said
mr
doubleday
i
want
it
to
make
laudanum
tartlets
we
are
all
so
fond
of
laudanum
tartlets
something
sharp
and
sarcastic
like
that
to
show
him
his
place
but
i
expect
it
did
mrs
antrobus
good
for
there
she
was
on
the
green
in
the
afternoon
and
her
face
was
swollen
for
i
had
a
good
look
at
her
oh
and
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
mr
georgie
and
i
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
a
moment
ago
we
talked
about
it
at
dinner
the
colonel
and
i
while
we
were
eating
our
bit
of
partridge
and
i
thought
georgie
will
be
sure
to
be
able
to
tell
us
and
if
you
did
ring
up
on
the
telephone
immediately
afterwards
that
seemed
just
providential
but
what
the
use
of
that
if
i
ca
remember
what
it
was
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
this
seemed
a
good
opening
for
his
startling
news
but
georgie
rejected
it
as
it
was
too
early
yet
i
wonder
what
it
could
have
been
he
said
well
it
will
come
back
to
me
presently
and
here
our
coffee
and
i
see
elizabeth
has
forgotten
to
bring
a
drop
of
something
good
for
you
two
gentlemen
and
i
do
say
that
i
wo
join
you
if
elizabeth
will
bring
another
glass
what
with
a
glass
of
burgundy
at
my
dinner
and
a
drop
of
brandy
now
i
shall
be
quite
tipsy
unless
i
take
care
the
guru
now
mr
georgie
no
that
not
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
but
has
there
been
any
news
of
the
guru
for
a
moment
in
this
juxtaposition
of
the
topics
of
brandy
and
guru
georgie
was
afraid
that
something
might
have
leaked
out
about
the
contents
of
the
cupboard
in
othello
but
it
was
evidently
a
chance
combination
for
mrs
weston
went
straight
on
without
waiting
for
an
answer
what
a
day
that
was
she
said
when
he
and
miss
olga
bracely
were
both
at
mrs
lucas
ah
now
i
got
it
now
i
know
what
i
wanted
to
ask
when
will
miss
olga
bracely
come
to
live
at
old
place
quite
soon
now
i
suppose
if
georgie
had
not
put
down
his
embroidery
with
great
expedition
he
would
undoubtedly
have
pricked
his
finger
but
how
on
earth
did
you
know
she
was
coming
at
all
he
said
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
that
she
was
coming
as
a
great
bit
of
news
how
tarsome
it
spoiled
all
my
pleasure
haw
hum
not
a
very
gallant
speech
when
you
talking
to
mrs
weston
said
the
colonel
who
hated
georgie
embroidery
luckily
the
pleasure
in
the
punitive
part
of
the
expedition
remained
and
georgie
recovered
himself
he
had
some
news
too
he
could
answer
mrs
weston
question
but
it
was
to
have
been
such
a
secret
until
the
whole
thing
was
ready
he
said
i
knew
all
along
i
have
known
since
the
day
of
the
no
one
but
me
not
even
her
husband
he
was
well
rewarded
for
the
recovery
of
his
temper
mrs
weston
put
down
her
glass
of
something
good
untasted
what
she
said
is
she
going
to
live
here
alone
in
hiding
from
him
have
they
quarrelled
so
soon
georgie
had
to
disappoint
her
about
this
and
gave
the
authentic
version
and
she
coming
next
week
monday
probably
he
said
they
were
all
now
extremely
happy
for
mrs
weston
felt
convinced
that
nobody
else
had
put
two
and
two
together
with
the
same
brilliant
result
as
herself
and
georgie
was
in
the
even
superior
position
of
having
known
the
result
without
having
to
do
any
addition
at
all
and
colonel
boucher
enjoyed
the
first
fruits
of
it
all
when
they
parted
having
thoroughly
discussed
it
the
chief
preoccupation
in
the
minds
of
all
was
the
number
of
riseholmites
that
each
of
them
would
be
the
first
to
pass
on
the
news
to
mrs
weston
could
tell
elizabeth
that
night
and
colonel
boucher
his
but
the
first
blood
was
really
drawn
by
georgie
who
seeing
a
light
in
mrs
quantock
drawing
room
when
he
returned
dropped
in
for
a
moment
and
scored
a
right
and
left
by
telling
robert
who
let
him
in
before
going
upstairs
and
mrs
quantock
when
he
got
there
it
was
impossible
to
do
any
more
that
night
lucia
was
always
very
busy
of
a
morning
in
polishing
the
sword
and
shield
of
art
in
order
to
present
herself
daily
to
her
subjects
in
shining
armour
and
keep
a
little
ahead
of
them
all
in
culture
and
thus
did
not
as
a
rule
take
part
in
the
parliament
on
the
green
moreover
georgie
usually
dropped
in
before
lunch
and
her
casual
interrogation
any
news
as
they
sat
down
to
the
piano
elicited
from
him
as
in
a
neat
little
jug
the
cream
of
the
morning
milkings
today
she
was
attired
in
her
teacher
robe
for
the
elementary
class
though
not
always
now
in
full
conclave
gathered
at
her
house
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
there
had
been
signs
of
late
that
the
interest
of
her
pupils
was
on
the
wane
for
colonel
boucher
had
not
appeared
for
two
meetings
nor
had
mrs
weston
come
to
the
last
but
it
was
part
of
lucia
policy
to
let
guruism
die
a
natural
death
without
herself
facilitating
its
happy
release
and
she
meant
to
be
ready
for
her
class
at
the
appointed
times
as
long
as
anybody
turned
up
besides
the
teacher
robe
was
singularly
becoming
and
she
often
wore
it
when
there
was
no
question
of
teaching
at
all
but
today
though
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
at
the
complete
absence
of
pupils
she
was
still
in
consultation
with
her
cook
over
the
commissariat
of
the
day
when
a
succession
of
tinklings
from
the
mermaid
tail
announced
that
a
full
meeting
was
assembling
her
maid
in
fact
had
announced
to
her
without
pause
except
to
go
to
the
door
and
back
though
it
still
wanted
a
few
minutes
to
eleven
that
colonel
boucher
mrs
weston
mrs
antrobus
and
piggy
were
all
assembled
in
the
even
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
on
her
way
georgie
came
hurrying
across
shakespeare
garden
his
figure
distorted
through
the
wavy
glass
of
the
windows
and
she
opened
the
door
to
him
herself
she
said
oo
not
angry
with
lucia
for
saying
she
was
busy
last
night
and
now
i
just
going
to
take
my
they
all
came
rather
early
and
i
have
seen
any
of
them
yet
any
news
georgie
heaved
a
sigh
all
riseholme
knew
by
this
time
and
he
was
going
to
score
one
more
by
telling
lucia
my
dear
have
you
heard
yet
he
asked
i
was
going
to
tell
you
last
night
the
tenant
of
old
place
asked
lucia
unerringly
yes
guess
said
georgie
tantalizingly
this
was
his
last
revelation
and
he
wanted
to
spin
it
out
lucia
decided
on
a
great
stroke
involving
risks
but
magnificent
if
it
came
off
in
a
flash
she
guessed
why
all
the
had
come
so
each
of
them
she
felt
convinced
wanted
to
have
the
joy
of
telling
her
after
everybody
else
knew
who
the
new
tenant
was
on
the
top
of
this
bitterness
was
the
added
acrimony
of
georgie
whose
clear
duty
it
was
to
have
informed
her
the
moment
he
knew
wanting
to
make
the
same
revelation
to
her
last
of
all
riseholme
she
had
already
had
her
suspicions
for
she
had
not
forgotten
the
fact
that
olga
bracely
and
georgie
had
played
croquet
all
afternoon
when
they
should
have
been
at
her
and
she
determined
to
risk
all
for
the
sake
of
spoiling
georgie
pleasure
in
telling
her
she
gave
her
silvery
laugh
that
started
so
she
had
ascertained
on
a
flat
above
the
treble
clef
did
all
my
questions
as
to
who
it
was
really
take
you
in
she
asked
just
as
if
i
had
known
all
along
why
miss
olga
bracely
of
course
georgie
fallen
face
shewed
her
how
completely
she
had
spoiled
his
pleasure
who
told
you
he
asked
she
rattled
her
tassels
little
bird
she
said
i
must
run
away
to
my
class
or
they
will
scold
me
once
again
before
they
settled
down
to
high
philosophies
lucia
had
the
pleasure
of
disappointing
the
ambitions
of
her
class
to
surprise
inform
and
astonish
her
good
morning
to
you
all
she
said
and
before
we
settle
down
give
you
a
little
bit
of
news
now
that
at
last
i
allowed
to
dear
miss
olga
bracely
whom
i
think
you
all
met
here
is
coming
to
live
at
old
place
will
she
not
be
a
great
addition
to
our
musical
parties
now
please
but
this
splendid
bravado
was
but
a
scintillation
on
a
hard
and
highly
polished
surface
and
had
georgie
been
able
to
penetrate
into
heart
he
would
have
found
complete
healing
for
his
recent
severe
mortification
he
did
not
really
believe
that
lucia
had
known
all
along
like
himself
who
the
new
tenant
was
for
her
enquiries
had
seemed
to
be
pointed
with
the
most
piercing
curiosity
but
after
all
lucia
when
she
did
not
forget
her
part
was
a
fine
actress
and
perhaps
all
the
time
he
thought
he
had
been
punishing
her
she
had
been
fooling
him
and
in
any
ease
he
certainly
had
not
had
the
joy
of
telling
her
whether
she
had
guessed
or
really
knew
it
was
she
who
had
told
him
and
there
was
no
getting
over
it
he
went
back
straight
home
and
drew
a
caricature
of
her
but
if
georgie
was
sitting
with
a
clouded
brow
lucia
was
troubled
by
nothing
less
than
a
raging
tornado
of
agitated
thought
though
olga
would
undoubtedly
be
a
great
addition
to
the
musical
talent
of
riseholme
would
she
fall
into
line
and
for
instance
bring
her
music
and
sing
after
dinner
when
lucia
asked
her
as
regards
music
it
was
possible
that
she
might
be
almost
too
great
an
addition
and
cause
the
rest
of
the
gifted
amateurs
to
sink
into
comparative
insignificance
at
present
lucia
was
at
every
altar
of
art
and
she
could
not
think
with
equanimity
of
seeing
anybody
in
charge
of
the
ritual
at
any
again
to
so
eminent
an
there
must
be
conceded
a
certain
dramatic
knowledge
and
indeed
georgie
had
often
spoken
to
lucia
of
that
superb
moment
when
brunnhilde
woke
and
hailed
the
sun
must
lucia
give
up
the
direction
of
dramatic
art
as
well
as
of
music
point
by
point
pricked
themselves
out
of
the
general
gloom
and
hoisted
danger
signals
then
suddenly
the
whole
was
in
blaze
together
what
if
olga
took
the
lead
not
in
this
particular
or
in
that
but
attempted
to
constitute
herself
supreme
in
the
affairs
of
riseholme
it
was
all
very
well
for
her
to
be
a
brilliant
bird
of
passage
just
for
a
couple
of
days
and
drop
so
to
speak
a
moulted
feather
a
eagle
feather
on
lucia
party
thereby
causing
it
to
shine
out
from
all
previous
festivities
making
it
the
hightumest
affair
that
had
ever
happened
but
it
was
a
totally
different
matter
to
contemplate
her
permanent
residence
here
it
seemed
possible
that
then
she
might
keep
her
feathers
to
line
her
own
eyrie
she
thought
of
belshazzar
feast
and
the
writing
of
doom
on
the
wall
which
she
was
daniel
enough
to
interpret
herself
thy
kingdom
is
divided
it
said
and
given
to
the
bracelys
or
the
shuttleworths
she
rallied
her
forces
if
olga
meant
to
show
herself
that
sort
of
woman
she
should
soon
know
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
not
but
what
lucia
would
give
her
the
chance
first
of
behaving
with
suitable
loyalty
and
obedience
she
would
even
condescend
to
cooperate
with
her
so
long
as
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
she
aimed
at
no
supremacy
but
there
was
only
one
lawgiver
in
riseholme
one
court
of
appeal
one
dispenser
of
destiny
her
own
firmness
of
soul
calmed
and
invigorated
her
and
changing
her
teacher
robe
for
a
walking
dress
she
went
out
up
the
road
that
led
by
old
place
to
see
what
could
be
observed
of
the
interior
from
outside
chapter
ten
one
morning
about
the
middle
of
october
lucia
was
seated
at
breakfast
and
frowning
over
a
note
she
had
just
received
it
began
without
any
formality
and
was
written
in
pencil
do
look
in
about
nine
on
saturday
and
be
silly
for
an
hour
or
two
we
play
games
and
dance
shall
we
bring
your
husband
of
course
and
do
bother
to
reply
an
invitation
she
said
icily
as
she
passed
it
to
her
husband
rather
short
notice
we
not
doing
anything
are
we
he
asked
peppino
was
a
little
imperceptive
sometimes
no
it
was
that
i
meant
she
said
but
there
a
little
more
informality
about
it
than
one
would
expect
probably
it
an
informal
party
said
he
it
certainly
seems
most
informal
i
am
not
accustomed
to
be
asked
quite
like
that
peppino
began
to
be
aware
of
the
true
nature
of
the
situation
i
see
what
you
mean
he
said
so
do
let
us
go
then
she
will
take
the
hint
perhaps
lucia
thought
this
over
for
a
moment
and
found
that
she
rather
wanted
to
go
but
a
certain
resentment
that
had
been
slowly
accumulating
in
her
mind
for
some
days
past
began
to
leak
out
first
before
she
consented
to
overlook
olga
informality
it
is
a
fortnight
since
i
called
on
her
she
said
and
she
has
not
even
returned
the
call
i
daresay
they
behave
like
that
in
london
in
certain
circles
but
i
do
know
that
london
is
any
better
for
it
she
has
been
away
twice
since
she
came
said
peppino
she
has
hardly
been
here
for
a
couple
of
days
together
yet
i
may
be
wrong
said
lucia
no
doubt
i
am
wrong
but
i
should
have
thought
that
she
might
have
spared
out
of
these
days
by
returning
my
call
however
she
thought
not
peppino
suddenly
recollected
a
thrilling
piece
of
news
which
most
unaccountably
he
had
forgotten
to
tell
lucia
dear
me
something
slipped
my
memory
he
said
i
met
mrs
weston
yesterday
afternoon
who
told
me
that
half
an
hour
ago
miss
bracely
had
seen
her
in
her
and
had
taken
the
handles
from
tommy
luton
and
pushed
her
twice
round
the
green
positively
running
that
does
not
seem
to
me
of
very
prime
importance
said
lucia
though
she
was
thrilled
to
the
marrow
i
do
not
wonder
it
slipped
your
memory
wait
a
minute
that
is
not
all
she
told
mrs
weston
that
she
would
have
returned
her
call
but
that
she
had
got
any
calling
cards
impossible
cried
lucia
they
could
have
printed
them
at
olde
booke
shop
in
an
afternoon
that
may
be
so
indeed
if
you
say
so
it
is
said
peppino
anyhow
she
said
she
had
got
any
calling
cards
and
i
do
see
why
she
should
lie
about
it
no
it
is
not
the
confession
one
would
be
likely
to
make
said
she
unless
it
was
true
or
even
if
it
was
she
added
anyhow
it
explains
why
she
has
not
been
here
said
peppino
she
would
naturally
like
to
do
everything
in
order
when
she
called
on
you
it
would
have
been
embarrassing
if
you
were
out
and
she
could
not
hand
in
her
card
and
about
mr
shuttleworth
asked
she
in
an
absent
voice
as
if
she
had
no
real
interest
in
her
question
he
has
not
been
seen
yet
at
all
as
far
as
i
can
gather
then
shall
we
have
no
host
if
we
drop
in
tomorrow
night
let
us
go
and
see
said
he
gaily
apart
from
this
matter
of
her
call
not
being
returned
lucia
had
not
as
yet
had
any
reason
to
suspect
olga
of
revolutionary
designs
on
the
throne
she
had
done
odd
things
pushing
mrs
weston
chair
round
the
green
was
one
of
them
smoking
a
cigarette
as
she
came
back
from
church
on
sunday
was
another
but
these
she
set
down
to
the
bohemianism
and
want
of
polish
which
might
be
expected
from
her
upbringing
if
you
could
call
an
orphan
school
at
brixton
an
upbringing
at
all
this
terrific
fact
georgie
had
let
slip
in
his
stern
determination
to
know
twice
as
much
about
olga
as
anybody
else
and
lucia
had
treasured
it
she
had
in
the
last
fortnight
labelled
olga
as
rather
common
retaining
however
a
certain
respect
for
her
professional
career
given
that
that
professional
career
was
to
be
thrown
down
as
a
carpet
for
her
own
feet
but
after
all
if
olga
was
a
bit
bohemian
in
her
way
of
life
as
exhibited
by
the
absence
of
calling
cards
lucia
was
perfectly
ready
to
overlook
that
confident
in
the
refining
influence
of
riseholme
and
to
go
to
the
informal
party
next
day
if
she
felt
so
disposed
for
no
direct
answer
was
asked
for
there
was
a
considerable
illumination
in
the
windows
of
old
place
when
she
and
peppino
set
out
after
dinner
next
night
to
go
to
the
silly
party
kindly
overlooking
the
informality
and
the
absence
of
a
return
visit
to
her
call
it
had
been
a
sloppy
day
of
rain
and
as
was
natural
lucia
carried
some
very
smart
indoor
shoes
in
a
and
peppino
had
his
russian
goloshes
on
these
were
immense
in
which
his
evening
shoes
were
completely
encased
but
lucia
preferred
not
to
disfigure
her
feet
to
that
extent
and
was
clad
in
neat
which
she
could
exchange
for
her
smart
satin
footwear
in
the
the
resumption
of
when
the
evening
was
over
was
rather
a
feature
among
the
ladies
and
was
called
the
cobbler
the
two
started
rather
late
for
it
was
fitting
that
lucia
should
be
the
last
to
arrive
they
had
come
to
the
door
of
the
old
place
and
peppino
was
fumbling
in
the
dark
for
the
bell
when
lucia
gave
a
little
cry
of
agony
and
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
just
as
if
she
had
been
seized
with
a
of
peculiar
intensity
gramophone
she
said
faintly
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
from
the
window
close
at
hand
came
out
the
excruciating
strains
of
a
very
lusty
instrument
and
the
record
was
that
of
a
vulgar
catchy
taken
down
from
a
all
riseholme
knew
what
her
opinion
about
gramophones
was
to
the
lover
of
beethoven
they
were
like
indecent
and
profane
language
loudly
used
in
a
public
place
only
one
so
far
as
was
known
had
ever
come
to
riseholme
and
that
was
introduced
by
the
misguided
robert
quantock
once
he
had
turned
it
on
in
her
presence
but
the
look
of
agony
which
crossed
her
face
was
such
that
he
had
to
stop
it
immediately
then
the
door
was
opened
and
the
abominable
noise
poured
out
in
increased
volume
lucia
paused
for
a
moment
in
indecision
would
it
be
the
great
the
magnificent
thing
to
go
home
without
coming
in
trusting
to
peppino
to
let
it
be
widely
known
what
had
turned
her
back
from
the
door
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
that
for
it
would
be
living
up
to
her
own
high
and
immutable
standards
on
the
other
hand
she
particularly
wanted
to
see
what
standard
of
entertaining
olga
was
initiating
the
silly
evening
was
quite
a
new
type
of
party
for
since
she
had
directed
and
controlled
the
social
side
of
things
there
had
been
no
silly
evenings
of
any
kind
in
riseholme
and
it
might
be
a
good
thing
to
ensure
the
failure
of
this
in
case
she
did
not
like
it
by
setting
the
example
of
a
bored
and
frosty
face
but
if
she
went
in
the
gramophone
must
be
stopped
she
would
sit
and
wince
and
peppino
must
explain
her
feeling
about
gramophones
that
would
be
a
suitable
exhibition
of
authority
or
she
might
tell
olga
lucia
put
on
her
satin
shoes
leaving
her
boots
till
the
hour
of
the
cobbler
came
and
composing
her
face
to
a
suitable
wince
was
led
by
a
footman
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
of
the
big
music
room
which
georgie
had
spoken
of
if
you
please
to
step
in
very
quietly
he
said
the
room
was
full
of
people
all
riseholme
was
there
and
since
there
were
not
nearly
enough
chairs
lucia
saw
at
once
a
large
number
were
sitting
on
the
floor
on
cushions
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
dais
to
the
corner
of
which
the
grand
piano
had
been
pushed
on
the
top
of
which
with
its
braying
trumpet
pointing
straight
at
lucia
was
an
immense
gramophone
on
the
dais
was
olga
dancing
she
was
dressed
in
some
white
soft
fabric
shimmering
with
silver
which
left
her
beautiful
arms
bare
to
the
shoulder
it
was
cut
squarely
and
simply
about
the
neck
and
hung
in
straight
folds
down
to
just
above
her
ankles
she
held
in
her
hands
some
long
shimmering
scarf
of
brilliant
red
that
floated
and
undulated
as
she
moved
as
if
inspired
by
some
life
of
its
own
that
it
drew
out
of
her
slim
superb
vitality
from
the
cloud
of
shifting
crimson
with
the
slow
billows
of
silver
moving
rhythmically
round
her
body
that
beautiful
face
looked
out
deliciously
smiling
and
brimming
with
life
lucia
had
hardly
entered
when
with
a
final
bray
the
gramophone
came
to
the
end
of
its
record
and
olga
swept
a
great
curtsey
threw
down
her
scarf
and
stepped
off
the
dais
georgie
was
sitting
on
the
floor
close
to
it
and
jumped
up
leading
the
applause
for
a
moment
though
several
heads
had
been
turned
at
lucia
entrance
nobody
took
the
slightest
notice
of
her
indeed
the
first
apparently
to
recognize
her
presence
was
her
hostess
who
just
kissed
her
hand
to
her
and
then
continued
talking
to
georgie
then
olga
threaded
her
way
through
the
besprinkled
floor
and
came
up
to
her
how
wise
you
were
to
miss
that
very
poor
performance
she
said
but
mr
georgie
insisted
that
i
should
make
a
fool
of
myself
indeed
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
been
here
for
it
said
lucia
in
her
most
stately
manner
it
seemed
to
me
very
far
from
being
a
poor
performance
very
far
indeed
you
remember
miss
bracely
si
molto
said
peppino
shaking
hands
ah
and
you
talk
italian
said
olga
bella
lingua
i
wish
i
knew
it
you
have
a
very
good
pronunciation
said
lucia
you
know
everyone
here
of
course
now
what
shall
we
do
next
clumps
or
charades
or
what
ah
there
are
some
cigarettes
wo
you
have
one
lucia
gave
a
little
scream
of
dismay
a
cigarette
for
me
that
would
be
a
very
odd
thing
she
said
then
relenting
as
she
remembered
that
olga
must
be
excused
for
her
ignorance
she
added
you
see
i
never
smoke
never
oh
you
should
learn
said
olga
now
let
play
clumps
does
everyone
know
clumps
if
they
do
they
will
find
out
or
shall
we
dance
there
the
gramophone
to
dance
to
lucia
put
up
her
hands
in
playful
petition
oh
please
no
gramophone
she
said
oh
do
you
like
it
said
olga
it
so
horrible
that
i
adore
it
as
i
adore
dreadful
creatures
in
an
aquarium
but
i
think
we
dance
till
after
supper
we
have
supper
extremely
soon
partly
because
i
am
dying
of
famine
and
partly
because
people
are
sillier
afterwards
but
just
one
game
of
clumps
first
let
see
there
are
but
enough
for
four
clumps
please
make
four
clumps
everybody
and
and
will
you
and
two
more
go
out
with
mr
georgie
mrs
lucas
we
will
be
as
quick
as
we
can
and
we
wo
think
of
anything
that
will
make
mr
georgie
blush
oh
there
he
is
he
heard
olga
intense
enjoyment
of
her
own
party
was
rapidly
galvanizing
everybody
into
a
much
keener
gaiety
than
was
at
all
usual
in
riseholme
where
as
a
rule
the
hostess
was
somewhat
anxious
and
watchful
fearing
that
her
guests
were
not
amusing
themselves
and
that
the
sandwiches
would
give
out
there
was
a
supper
when
the
clumps
were
over
mrs
quantock
had
been
the
first
to
guess
beethoven
little
toe
on
his
right
foot
which
made
lucia
wince
and
there
were
not
enough
men
and
maids
to
wait
and
so
people
foraged
for
themselves
and
olga
paraded
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
in
one
hand
and
a
dish
of
in
the
other
she
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
first
at
one
table
and
then
at
another
and
asked
silly
riddles
and
sent
to
the
kitchen
for
a
ham
and
put
out
all
the
electric
light
by
mistake
when
she
meant
to
turn
on
some
more
then
when
supper
was
over
they
all
took
their
seats
back
into
the
and
played
musical
chairs
at
the
end
of
which
mrs
quantock
was
left
in
with
olga
and
it
was
believed
that
she
said
damn
when
mrs
quantock
won
georgie
was
in
charge
of
the
gramophone
which
supplied
deadly
music
quite
forgetting
that
this
was
agony
to
lucia
and
not
even
being
aware
when
she
made
a
sign
to
peppino
and
went
away
having
a
cobbler
all
to
herself
nobody
noticed
when
saturday
ended
and
sunday
began
for
georgie
and
colonel
boucher
were
on
the
floor
georgie
screaming
out
how
tarsome
when
he
was
upset
and
colonel
boucher
very
red
in
the
face
saying
haw
hum
never
thought
i
should
romp
again
like
this
by
jove
most
amusing
georgie
was
the
last
to
leave
and
did
not
notice
till
he
was
home
that
he
had
a
adorning
his
shirt
front
he
hoped
that
it
had
been
olga
who
put
it
there
when
he
had
to
walk
across
the
floor
and
try
to
keep
in
a
straight
line
riseholme
got
up
rather
late
next
morning
and
had
to
hurry
over
its
breakfast
in
order
to
be
in
time
for
church
there
was
a
slight
feeling
of
reaction
abroad
and
a
sense
of
having
been
young
and
amused
and
of
waking
now
to
the
fact
of
and
colonel
boucher
singing
the
bass
of
a
few
more
years
shall
roll
felt
his
mind
instinctively
wandering
to
the
the
evening
before
and
depressedly
recollecting
that
a
considerable
number
of
years
had
rolled
already
mrs
weston
with
her
in
the
aisle
and
tommy
luton
to
hand
her
and
as
she
required
looked
sideways
at
mrs
quantock
and
thought
how
strange
it
was
that
daisy
so
few
hours
ago
had
been
racing
round
a
solitary
chair
with
georgie
finger
on
the
gramophone
while
georgie
singing
tenor
by
colonel
ample
side
saw
with
keen
annoyance
that
there
was
a
stain
of
tarnished
silver
on
his
forefinger
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
after
breakfast
he
had
been
cleaning
the
frame
which
held
the
photograph
of
olga
bracely
and
had
been
astonished
to
hear
the
beginning
another
conducement
to
depression
on
his
part
was
the
fact
that
he
was
lunching
with
lucia
and
he
could
not
imagine
what
attitude
would
be
towards
the
party
last
night
she
had
come
to
church
rather
late
having
no
use
for
the
general
confession
and
sang
with
stony
fervour
she
wore
her
usual
from
which
nothing
whatever
could
be
gathered
a
great
many
stealthy
glances
right
and
left
from
everybody
failed
to
reveal
the
presence
of
their
hostess
of
last
night
georgie
in
particular
was
sorry
for
this
he
would
have
liked
her
to
show
that
capacity
for
respectable
seriousness
which
her
presence
at
church
that
morning
would
have
implied
while
lucia
in
particular
was
glad
of
this
for
it
confirmed
her
view
that
miss
bracely
was
not
nor
could
ever
be
a
true
riseholmite
she
had
thought
as
much
last
night
and
had
said
so
to
peppino
she
proposed
to
say
the
same
to
georgie
today
then
came
a
stupefying
surprise
as
mr
rumbold
walked
from
his
stall
to
the
pulpit
for
the
sermon
generally
he
gave
out
the
number
of
the
short
anthem
which
accompanied
this
manoeuvre
but
today
he
made
no
such
announcement
a
discreet
curtain
hid
the
organist
from
the
congregation
and
veiled
his
gymnastics
with
the
stops
and
his
antic
dancing
on
the
pedals
and
now
when
mr
rumbold
moved
from
his
stall
there
came
from
the
organ
the
short
introduction
to
bach
mein
glaubige
herz
which
even
lucia
had
allowed
to
be
nearly
equal
to
beethoven
and
then
came
the
voice
the
reaction
after
the
romp
last
night
went
out
like
a
snuffed
candle
at
this
divine
singing
which
was
charged
with
the
joyfulness
of
some
heavenly
child
it
grew
low
and
soft
it
rang
out
again
it
lingered
and
tarried
it
quickened
into
the
ultimate
triumph
no
singing
could
have
been
simpler
but
that
simplicity
could
only
have
sprung
from
the
highest
art
but
now
the
art
was
wholly
unconscious
it
was
part
of
the
singer
who
but
praised
god
as
the
thrushes
do
she
who
had
made
gaiety
last
night
made
worship
this
morning
as
they
sat
down
for
the
discourse
colonel
boucher
discreetly
whispered
to
georgie
by
jove
and
georgie
rather
more
audibly
answered
adorable
mrs
weston
drew
a
from
her
purse
instead
of
her
usual
shilling
to
be
ready
for
the
offertory
and
mrs
quantock
wondered
if
she
was
too
old
to
learn
to
sing
georgie
found
lucia
very
full
of
talk
that
day
at
luncheon
and
was
markedly
more
italian
than
usual
indeed
she
put
down
an
italian
grammar
when
he
entered
the
and
covered
it
up
with
the
essays
of
antonio
caporelli
this
possibly
had
some
connection
with
the
fact
that
she
had
encouraged
olga
last
night
with
regard
to
her
pronunciation
arrivato
she
said
finito
il
libro
di
antonio
caporelli
quanta
memento
e
magnifico
georgie
thought
she
had
finished
it
long
ago
but
perhaps
he
was
mistaken
the
sentence
flew
off
lucia
tongue
as
if
it
was
perched
there
all
quite
ready
un
poco
fatigata
dopo
dear
me
how
rusty
i
am
getting
in
italian
for
i
ca
remember
the
word
she
went
on
anyhow
i
am
a
little
tired
after
last
night
a
delightful
little
party
was
it
not
it
was
clever
of
miss
bracely
to
get
so
many
people
together
at
so
short
a
notice
once
in
a
while
that
sort
of
romp
is
very
well
i
enjoyed
it
quite
enormously
said
georgie
i
saw
you
did
said
she
you
quite
forgot
about
your
poor
lucia
and
her
horror
of
that
dreadful
gramophone
i
had
to
exert
all
the
calmness
that
yoga
has
given
me
not
to
scream
but
you
were
naughty
with
the
gramophone
over
those
musical
chairs
unmusical
chairs
as
i
said
to
peppino
did
i
taking
it
off
and
putting
it
on
again
so
suddenly
each
time
i
thought
it
was
the
end
pronta
la
colazione
presently
they
were
seated
the
menu
an
unusual
thing
in
itself
at
luncheon
was
written
in
italian
the
scribe
being
clearly
lucia
i
shall
want
a
lot
of
georgino
this
week
she
said
for
peppino
and
i
have
quite
settled
we
must
give
a
little
after
dinner
party
next
saturday
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
arrange
some
impromptu
tableaux
everything
impromptu
must
just
be
sketched
out
first
and
i
daresay
miss
bracely
worked
a
great
deal
at
her
dance
last
night
and
i
wish
i
had
seen
more
of
it
she
was
a
little
awkward
in
the
management
of
her
draperies
i
thought
but
i
daresay
she
does
not
know
much
about
dancing
still
it
was
very
graceful
and
effective
for
an
amateur
and
she
carried
it
off
very
well
oh
but
she
is
not
quite
an
amateur
said
georgie
she
has
played
in
salome
lucia
pursed
her
lips
indeed
i
am
sorry
she
played
in
that
she
said
with
her
undoubtedly
great
gifts
i
should
have
thought
she
might
have
found
a
worthier
object
naturally
i
have
not
heard
it
i
should
be
very
much
ashamed
to
be
seen
there
but
about
our
tableaux
now
peppino
thought
we
might
open
with
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
that
i
have
lost
my
pearls
he
would
be
the
executioner
and
you
the
priest
then
i
should
like
to
have
the
awakening
of
brunnhilde
that
would
be
lovely
said
georgie
have
you
asked
miss
olga
if
she
will
you
do
quite
understand
said
lucia
this
party
is
to
be
for
miss
bracely
i
was
her
guest
last
night
in
spite
of
the
gramophone
and
indeed
i
hope
she
will
find
nothing
in
my
house
that
jars
on
her
as
much
as
her
gramophone
jarred
on
me
i
had
a
dreadful
nightmare
last
night
did
i
peppino
in
consequence
about
the
brunnhilde
tableaux
i
thought
peppino
would
be
siegfried
and
perhaps
you
could
learn
just
fifteen
or
twenty
bars
of
the
music
and
play
it
while
the
curtain
was
up
you
can
play
the
same
over
again
if
it
is
encored
then
how
about
king
cophetua
and
the
i
should
be
with
my
back
to
the
audience
and
should
not
turn
round
at
all
it
would
be
quite
your
tableaux
we
will
just
sketch
them
out
as
i
said
and
have
a
grouping
or
two
to
make
sure
we
do
get
in
each
other
way
and
i
will
see
that
there
are
some
dresses
of
some
kind
which
we
can
just
throw
on
the
tableaux
with
a
little
music
serious
music
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
keep
everybody
interested
by
this
time
georgie
had
got
a
tolerable
inkling
of
the
import
of
all
this
it
was
not
at
present
to
be
war
it
was
to
be
magnificent
rivalry
a
throwing
down
perhaps
of
a
gauntlet
which
none
would
venture
to
pick
up
to
confirm
this
view
lucia
went
on
with
gathering
animation
i
do
not
propose
to
have
games
romps
shall
i
call
them
she
said
for
as
far
as
i
know
riseholme
and
perhaps
i
know
it
a
little
better
than
dear
miss
bracely
riseholme
does
not
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
not
quite
in
our
line
we
may
be
right
or
wrong
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
dear
miss
bracely
did
her
very
best
last
night
i
am
sure
she
was
prompted
only
by
the
most
hospitable
motives
but
how
should
she
know
the
supper
too
peppino
counted
nineteen
empty
champagne
bottles
eighteen
said
peppino
i
think
you
told
me
nineteen
but
it
makes
very
little
difference
eighteen
empty
champagne
bottles
standing
on
the
sideboard
and
no
end
to
the
caviare
sandwiches
which
were
left
over
it
was
all
too
much
though
there
were
not
nearly
enough
chairs
and
indeed
i
never
got
one
at
all
except
just
at
supper
lucia
leaned
forward
over
the
table
with
her
hands
clasped
there
was
display
about
it
and
you
know
how
i
hate
display
she
said
shakespeare
was
content
with
the
most
modest
scenery
for
his
masterpieces
and
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
if
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
carried
away
by
mere
wasteful
opulence
in
all
the
years
i
have
lived
here
and
contributed
in
my
humble
way
to
the
life
of
the
place
i
have
heard
no
complaints
about
my
suppers
or
teas
nor
about
the
quality
of
entertainment
which
i
offer
my
guests
when
they
are
so
good
as
to
say
to
mie
art
is
not
advanced
by
romping
and
we
are
able
to
enjoy
ourselves
without
two
hundred
caviare
sandwiches
being
left
over
and
such
wasteful
cutting
of
the
ham
i
had
to
slice
the
chunk
she
gave
me
over
and
over
again
before
i
could
eat
it
georgie
felt
he
could
not
quite
let
this
pass
well
i
had
an
excellent
supper
he
said
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
besides
i
saw
peppino
tucking
in
like
anything
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
it
lucia
gave
her
silvery
laugh
you
are
a
boy
she
said
artfully
and
in
as
you
so
vulgarly
call
it
without
thinking
i
saying
nothing
against
the
supper
but
i
sure
that
peppino
and
colonel
boucher
would
have
felt
better
this
morning
if
they
had
been
wiser
last
night
but
not
the
real
point
i
want
to
show
miss
bracely
and
i
sure
she
will
be
grateful
for
it
the
sort
of
entertainment
that
has
contented
us
at
riseholme
for
so
long
i
will
frame
it
on
her
lines
i
will
ask
all
and
sundry
to
drop
in
with
just
a
few
hours
notice
as
she
did
everything
shall
be
good
and
there
shall
be
about
it
all
something
that
i
seemed
to
miss
last
night
there
was
a
little
bit
how
shall
i
say
it
a
little
bit
of
the
footlights
about
it
all
and
the
footlights
seem
to
me
to
have
been
extinguished
at
this
morning
the
singing
of
that
very
fine
aria
was
theatrical
i
ca
call
it
less
than
theatrical
she
fixed
georgie
with
her
black
beady
eye
and
smoothed
her
undulated
hair
theatrical
she
said
again
now
let
us
have
our
coffee
in
the
shall
lucia
play
a
little
bit
of
beethoven
to
take
out
any
nasty
taste
of
gramophone
me
no
likey
gramophone
at
all
nebber
georgie
now
began
to
feel
himself
able
to
sympathise
with
that
surfeited
swain
who
thought
how
happy
he
could
be
with
either
were
dear
charmer
away
certainly
he
had
been
very
happy
with
lucia
all
these
years
before
dear
charmer
alighted
in
riseholme
and
now
he
felt
that
should
lucia
decide
as
she
had
often
so
nearly
decided
to
spend
the
winter
on
the
riviera
riseholme
would
still
be
a
very
pleasant
place
of
residence
he
never
was
quite
sure
how
seriously
she
had
contemplated
a
winter
on
the
riviera
for
the
mere
mention
of
it
had
always
been
enough
to
make
him
protest
that
riseholme
could
not
possibly
exist
without
her
but
today
as
he
sat
and
heard
rather
than
listened
to
a
series
of
slow
movements
with
a
brief
and
hazardous
attempt
at
the
scherzo
of
the
moonlight
he
felt
that
if
any
talk
of
the
riviera
came
up
he
would
not
be
quite
so
insistent
as
to
the
impossibility
of
riseholme
continuing
to
exist
without
her
he
could
for
instance
have
existed
perfectly
well
this
sunday
afternoon
if
lucia
had
been
even
at
timbuctoo
or
the
antipodes
for
as
he
went
away
last
night
olga
had
thrown
a
casual
intimation
to
him
that
she
would
be
at
home
if
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
and
cared
to
drop
in
certainly
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
but
he
had
something
worse
to
do
peppino
was
sitting
in
the
with
eyes
closed
because
he
listened
to
music
better
so
and
with
head
that
nodded
occasionally
presumably
for
the
same
reason
but
the
cessation
of
the
slow
movement
naturally
made
him
cease
to
listen
and
he
stirred
and
gave
the
sigh
with
which
riseholme
always
acknowledged
the
end
of
a
slow
movement
georgie
sighed
too
and
lucia
sighed
they
all
sighed
and
then
lucia
began
again
so
peppino
closed
his
eyes
again
and
georgie
continued
his
mental
analysis
of
the
situation
at
present
so
he
concluded
lucia
did
not
mean
war
she
meant
as
by
some
great
armed
demonstration
to
exhibit
the
riseholme
spirit
in
its
full
panoply
and
then
crush
into
dazzled
submission
any
potential
rivalry
she
meant
also
to
exert
an
educational
influence
for
she
allowed
that
olga
had
great
gifts
and
she
meant
to
train
and
refine
those
gifts
so
that
they
might
when
exercised
under
benign
but
autocratic
supervision
conduce
to
the
strength
and
splendour
of
riseholme
naturally
she
must
be
loyally
and
ably
assisted
and
georgie
realized
that
the
tableau
of
king
cophetua
his
tableau
as
she
had
said
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
bribe
and
if
that
word
was
invidious
of
a
raising
of
his
pay
it
was
equally
certain
that
this
prolonged
recital
of
slow
movements
was
intended
to
produce
in
his
mind
a
vivid
consciousness
of
the
contrast
between
the
romp
last
night
and
the
present
tranquil
hour
and
it
did
not
fail
in
this
respect
lucia
shut
the
and
almost
before
they
had
given
their
sighs
spoke
i
think
i
will
have
a
little
first
she
said
i
will
ask
lady
ambermere
that
will
make
us
four
with
you
georgie
and
miss
bracely
and
mr
shuttleworth
will
make
six
the
rest
i
shall
ask
to
come
in
at
nine
for
i
know
lady
ambermere
does
not
like
late
hours
and
now
shall
we
talk
over
our
tableaux
so
even
lucia
mind
had
not
been
wholly
absorbed
in
beethoven
though
georgie
as
usual
told
her
she
had
never
played
so
divinely
chapter
eleven
the
manoeuvres
of
the
next
week
became
so
bewilderingly
complicated
that
by
wednesday
georgie
was
almost
thinking
of
going
away
to
the
seaside
with
foljambe
and
dicky
in
sheer
despair
and
in
after
years
he
could
not
without
great
mental
effort
succeed
in
straightening
it
all
out
and
the
effort
caused
quite
a
buzzing
in
his
head
that
sunday
evening
lucia
sent
an
invitation
to
lady
ambermere
for
dinner
and
tableaux
to
which
lady
ambermere
people
replied
by
telephone
on
monday
afternoon
that
her
ladyship
was
sorry
to
be
unable
lucia
therefore
gave
up
the
idea
of
a
and
reverted
to
her
original
scheme
of
an
evening
party
like
olga
got
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
with
great
care
and
most
anxious
preparation
the
rehearsals
for
the
impromptu
tableaux
meantime
went
steadily
forward
behind
closed
doors
and
georgie
wrestled
with
twenty
bars
of
the
music
of
the
awakening
of
brunnhilde
lucia
intended
to
ask
nobody
until
friday
evening
and
olga
should
see
what
sort
of
party
riseholme
could
raise
at
a
moment
notice
early
on
tuesday
morning
the
devil
entered
into
daisy
quantock
probably
by
means
of
subconscious
telepathy
and
she
proceeded
to
go
round
the
green
at
the
morning
parliament
and
ask
everybody
to
come
in
for
a
good
romp
on
saturday
evening
and
they
all
accepted
georgie
lucia
and
olga
were
absentees
and
so
making
a
visitation
she
went
first
to
georgie
he
with
secret
knowledge
of
the
tableaux
indeed
he
was
stitching
himself
a
robe
to
be
worn
by
king
cophetua
at
the
time
and
hastily
bundling
it
under
the
table
regretted
that
he
was
already
engaged
this
was
rather
mysterious
but
he
might
have
planned
for
all
mrs
quantock
knew
an
evening
when
he
would
be
busy
indoors
and
since
those
evenings
were
never
to
be
pried
upon
she
asked
no
questions
but
went
off
to
lucia
to
give
her
invitation
there
there
again
she
was
met
with
a
similarly
mysterious
refusal
lucia
much
regretted
that
she
and
peppino
were
unable
to
come
and
she
hoped
daisy
would
have
a
lovely
party
even
as
she
spoke
she
heard
her
telephone
bell
ringing
and
hurried
off
to
find
that
georgie
faithful
lieutenant
was
acquainting
her
with
the
fact
that
mrs
quantock
was
planning
a
party
for
saturday
he
did
not
know
how
far
she
had
got
at
that
moment
she
had
got
just
to
old
place
walking
at
unusual
speed
lucia
grasped
the
situation
with
amazing
quickness
and
cutting
off
georgie
with
a
snap
she
abandoned
all
idea
of
her
party
being
impromptu
and
rang
up
olga
she
would
secure
her
anyhow
the
telephone
was
in
the
hall
and
olga
with
her
hat
on
was
just
preparing
to
go
out
when
the
bell
sounded
the
words
of
grateful
acceptance
were
on
her
very
lips
when
her
bell
rang
too
very
long
and
insistently
and
had
hardly
left
off
when
it
began
again
olga
opened
the
door
herself
and
there
was
mrs
quantock
on
the
doorstep
with
her
invitation
for
saturday
night
she
was
obliged
to
refuse
but
promised
to
look
in
if
she
was
not
very
late
in
getting
away
from
mrs
lucas
and
pop
went
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
another
romp
would
be
lovely
already
the
evils
of
decentralisation
and
overlapping
were
becoming
manifest
lucia
rang
up
house
after
house
only
to
find
that
its
inhabitants
were
already
engaged
she
had
got
olga
and
georgie
and
could
begin
the
good
work
of
education
and
the
crushing
of
rivalry
not
by
force
but
by
pure
and
refined
example
but
mrs
quantock
had
got
everybody
else
in
the
old
days
this
could
never
have
happened
for
everything
devolved
round
one
central
body
now
with
the
appearance
of
this
other
great
star
all
the
known
laws
of
gravity
and
attraction
were
upset
georgie
again
summoned
to
the
telephone
recommended
an
appeal
to
mrs
quantock
better
nature
which
lucia
rejected
doubting
whether
she
had
one
but
what
about
the
tableaux
asked
georgie
we
three
ca
very
well
do
tableaux
for
miss
olga
to
look
at
then
lucia
showed
herself
truly
great
the
merit
of
the
tableaux
does
not
consist
in
the
number
of
the
audience
she
said
she
paused
a
moment
have
you
got
the
to
set
properly
she
asked
oh
it
do
said
georgie
dejectedly
on
tuesday
afternoon
olga
rang
up
lucia
again
to
say
that
her
husband
was
arriving
that
day
so
might
she
bring
him
on
saturday
to
this
lucia
cordially
assented
but
she
felt
that
a
husband
and
wife
sitting
together
and
looking
at
another
husband
and
wife
doing
tableaux
would
be
an
unusual
entertainment
and
not
characteristic
of
best
she
began
to
waver
about
the
tableaux
and
to
consider
dinner
instead
she
also
wondered
whether
she
had
been
wronging
dear
daisy
and
whether
she
had
a
better
nature
after
all
perhaps
georgie
might
ascertain
georgie
was
roused
from
a
little
fatigued
nap
by
the
telephone
for
he
had
fallen
asleep
over
king
cophetua
robe
lucia
explained
the
situation
and
delicately
suggested
that
it
would
be
so
easy
for
him
to
pop
in
to
dear
daisy
and
be
very
diplomatic
there
was
nobody
like
georgie
for
tact
so
with
a
heavy
yawn
he
popped
in
you
come
about
this
business
on
saturday
said
daisy
unerringly
have
you
georgie
remembered
his
character
for
tact
how
wonderful
of
you
to
guess
that
he
said
i
thought
we
might
see
if
we
could
arrange
something
if
we
put
our
heads
together
such
a
pity
to
split
up
we
i
mean
lucia
has
got
miss
olga
and
her
husband
coming
and
and
i
got
everybody
else
said
daisy
brightly
and
miss
bracely
is
coming
over
here
if
she
gets
away
early
probably
with
such
a
small
party
she
will
oh
i
should
count
on
that
said
he
we
are
having
some
tableaux
and
they
always
take
longer
than
you
think
dear
me
i
should
have
said
that
as
they
were
to
be
impromptu
but
i
really
believe
my
head
is
going
you
know
how
thorough
lucia
is
she
is
taking
a
great
deal
of
trouble
about
them
i
had
heard
about
that
said
mrs
quantock
she
thought
a
moment
well
i
do
want
to
spoil
lucia
evening
she
said
for
i
sure
nothing
could
be
so
ridiculous
as
three
people
doing
tableaux
for
two
others
and
on
the
other
hand
i
do
want
her
to
spoil
mine
for
what
to
prevent
her
going
on
with
the
tableaux
till
next
morning
if
she
wishes
to
keep
miss
bracely
away
from
my
house
i
sure
after
the
way
she
behaved
about
my
guru
well
never
mind
that
how
would
it
be
if
we
had
the
tableaux
first
at
lucia
and
then
came
on
here
if
lucia
cares
to
suggest
that
to
me
and
my
guests
consent
i
do
mind
doing
that
by
six
on
tuesday
evening
therefore
all
the
telephone
bells
of
riseholme
were
merrily
ringing
again
mrs
quantock
stipulated
that
lucia
party
should
end
at
precisely
if
it
did
end
before
and
that
everyone
should
then
be
free
to
flock
across
to
her
house
she
proposed
a
romp
that
should
even
outshine
olga
and
was
deep
in
the
study
of
a
manual
of
round
games
which
included
hunt
the
georgie
and
peppino
took
turns
at
the
telephone
ringing
up
all
mrs
quantock
guests
and
informing
them
of
the
double
pleasure
which
awaited
them
on
saturday
since
georgie
had
let
out
the
secret
of
the
impromptu
tableaux
to
mrs
quantock
there
was
no
reason
why
the
rest
of
riseholme
should
not
learn
of
this
firsthand
from
the
hurst
instead
of
with
promises
not
to
repeat
it
from
mrs
quantock
it
appeared
that
she
had
a
better
nature
than
lucia
credited
her
with
but
to
expect
her
not
to
tell
everybody
about
the
tableaux
would
be
putting
virtue
to
an
unfair
test
so
that
all
settled
said
georgie
as
he
returned
with
the
last
acceptance
and
how
fortunately
it
has
happened
after
all
but
what
a
day
it
has
been
nothing
but
telephoning
from
morning
till
night
if
we
go
on
like
this
the
company
will
pay
a
dividend
this
year
and
return
us
some
of
our
own
pennies
lucia
had
got
a
quantity
of
pearl
beads
and
was
stringing
them
for
the
tableau
of
mary
queen
of
scots
now
that
everyone
knows
she
said
we
might
allow
ourselves
a
little
more
elaboration
in
our
preparations
there
is
an
elizabethan
axe
at
the
ambermere
arms
which
i
might
borrow
for
peppino
then
about
the
brunnhilde
tableau
it
is
dawn
is
it
not
we
might
have
the
stage
quite
dark
when
the
curtain
goes
up
and
turn
up
a
lamp
very
slowly
behind
the
scene
so
that
it
shines
on
my
face
a
lamp
being
turned
up
very
slowly
is
wonderfully
effective
it
produces
a
perfect
illusion
could
you
manage
that
with
one
hand
and
play
the
music
of
the
awakening
with
the
other
georgino
i
quite
sure
i
could
said
he
well
then
peppino
must
do
it
before
he
comes
on
we
will
have
movement
in
this
tableau
i
think
that
will
be
quite
a
new
idea
peppino
shall
come
in
just
two
steps
when
he
has
turned
the
lamp
up
and
he
will
take
off
my
shield
and
armour
but
the
music
will
never
last
out
cried
georgie
i
shall
have
to
start
earlier
yes
perhaps
that
would
be
better
said
lucia
calmly
that
real
piece
of
too
i
am
glad
i
remembered
peppino
had
that
marshall
is
cleaning
it
now
and
it
will
give
a
far
finer
effect
than
the
tawdry
stuff
they
use
in
opera
then
i
sit
up
very
slowly
and
wave
first
my
right
arm
and
then
my
left
and
then
both
i
should
like
to
practise
that
now
on
the
sofa
lucia
had
just
lain
down
when
the
telephone
sounded
again
and
georgie
got
up
that
to
announce
a
dividend
he
said
and
tripped
into
the
hall
is
that
mrs
lucas
said
a
voice
he
knew
yes
miss
olga
he
said
and
this
is
me
oh
mr
georgie
how
fortunate
she
said
you
can
give
my
message
now
to
mrs
lucas
ca
you
i
a
perfect
fool
you
know
and
horribly
forgetful
what
the
matter
asked
georgie
faintly
it
about
saturday
i
just
remembered
that
georgie
and
i
not
you
you
know
are
going
away
for
the
weekend
will
you
tell
mrs
lucas
how
sorry
i
am
georgie
went
back
to
the
music
room
where
lucia
had
just
got
both
her
arms
waving
but
at
the
sight
of
his
face
she
dropped
them
and
took
a
firm
hold
of
herself
well
what
is
it
she
said
georgie
gave
the
message
and
she
got
off
the
sofa
rising
to
her
feet
while
her
mind
rose
to
the
occasion
i
am
sorry
that
miss
bracely
will
not
see
our
tableaux
she
said
but
as
she
was
not
acting
in
them
i
do
not
know
that
it
makes
much
difference
a
deadly
flatness
although
olga
absence
made
no
difference
descended
on
the
three
lucia
did
not
resume
her
for
after
all
these
years
her
acting
might
be
supposed
to
be
good
enough
for
riseholme
without
further
practice
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
the
borrowing
of
the
axe
from
the
ambermere
arms
but
having
begun
to
thread
her
she
finished
them
georgie
however
cared
no
longer
whether
the
gold
border
of
king
cophetua
mantle
went
quite
round
the
back
or
not
and
having
tacked
on
the
piece
he
was
working
at
rolled
it
up
it
was
just
going
to
be
an
ordinary
party
after
all
his
cup
was
empty
but
lucia
was
not
yet
quite
full
for
at
this
moment
miss
pony
stopped
at
the
gate
and
a
small
stableboy
presented
a
note
which
required
an
answer
in
spite
of
all
lucia
the
immediate
answer
it
got
was
a
flush
of
heightened
colour
mere
impertinence
she
said
i
will
read
it
aloud
dear
mrs
lucas
i
was
in
riseholme
this
morning
and
learn
from
mrs
weston
that
miss
bracely
will
be
at
your
house
on
saturday
night
so
i
shall
be
enchanted
to
come
to
dinner
after
all
you
must
know
that
i
make
a
rule
of
not
going
out
in
the
evening
except
for
some
special
reason
but
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
hear
her
sing
again
i
wonder
if
you
would
have
dinner
at
instead
of
as
i
do
not
like
being
out
very
late
there
was
a
short
pause
caro
said
lucia
trembling
violently
perhaps
you
would
kindly
tell
miss
lyall
that
i
do
not
expect
miss
bracely
on
saturday
and
that
i
do
not
expect
lady
ambermere
either
my
dear
he
began
i
will
do
it
myself
then
she
said
it
was
as
georgie
walked
home
after
the
delivery
of
this
message
that
he
wanted
to
fly
away
and
be
at
rest
with
foljambe
and
dicky
he
had
been
frantically
excited
ever
since
sunday
at
the
idea
of
doing
tableaux
before
olga
and
today
in
especial
had
been
a
mere
feverish
hash
of
telephoning
and
sewing
which
all
ended
in
nothing
at
all
for
neither
tableaux
nor
romps
seemed
to
hold
the
least
attraction
for
him
now
that
olga
was
not
going
to
be
there
and
then
all
at
once
it
dawned
on
him
that
he
must
be
in
love
with
olga
for
why
else
should
her
presence
or
absence
make
such
an
astounding
difference
to
him
he
stopped
dead
opposite
mrs
quantock
mulberry
tree
more
misery
more
unhappiness
he
said
to
himself
really
if
life
at
riseholme
was
to
become
a
series
of
agitated
days
ending
in
devastating
discoveries
the
sooner
he
went
away
with
foljambe
and
dicky
the
better
he
did
not
quite
know
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
love
for
the
nearest
he
had
previously
ever
got
to
it
was
when
he
saw
olga
awake
on
the
and
felt
that
he
had
missed
his
vocation
in
not
being
siegfried
but
from
that
he
guessed
this
time
too
it
was
about
olga
not
about
her
as
framed
in
the
romance
of
legend
and
song
but
of
her
as
she
appeared
at
riseholme
taking
as
she
did
now
an
ecstatic
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
place
so
short
a
time
ago
when
she
contemplated
coming
here
first
she
had
spoken
of
it
as
a
lazy
backwater
now
she
knew
better
than
that
for
she
could
listen
to
mrs
weston
far
longer
than
anybody
else
and
ask
for
more
histories
when
even
she
had
run
dry
and
yet
lucia
seemed
hardly
to
interest
her
at
all
georgie
wondered
why
that
was
he
raised
his
eyes
as
he
muttered
these
desolated
syllables
and
there
was
olga
just
letting
herself
out
of
the
front
garden
of
the
old
place
georgie
first
impulse
was
to
affect
not
to
see
her
and
turn
into
his
bachelor
house
but
she
had
certainly
seen
him
and
made
so
shrill
and
piercing
a
whistle
on
her
fingers
that
pretend
as
he
would
not
to
have
seen
her
it
was
ludicrous
to
appear
not
to
have
heard
her
she
beckoned
to
him
georgie
the
most
awful
thing
has
happened
she
said
as
they
came
within
speaking
distance
oh
i
called
you
georgie
by
mistake
then
when
one
once
does
that
one
must
go
on
doing
it
on
purpose
guess
she
said
in
the
best
riseholme
manner
you
can
come
to
lucia
party
after
all
said
he
no
i
ca
well
you
never
guess
because
you
move
in
such
high
circles
so
i
tell
you
mrs
weston
elizabeth
is
going
to
be
married
to
colonel
boucher
atkinson
i
do
know
his
christian
name
nor
her
surname
but
they
the
ones
you
do
say
so
said
georgie
stung
for
a
moment
out
of
his
own
troubles
but
will
they
both
leave
what
will
either
of
the
others
do
mrs
weston
ca
have
a
manservant
and
how
on
earth
is
she
to
get
on
without
elizabeth
besides
a
faint
flush
mounted
to
his
cheek
i
know
you
mean
babies
said
olga
ruthlessly
did
you
yes
said
georgie
then
why
not
say
so
you
and
i
were
babies
once
though
no
one
is
old
enough
to
remember
that
and
we
should
have
liked
our
parents
and
friends
to
have
blushed
when
they
mentioned
us
georgie
you
are
a
prude
no
i
not
said
georgie
remembering
he
was
probably
in
love
with
a
married
woman
it
does
matter
whether
you
are
or
not
now
there
only
one
thing
that
can
happen
to
mrs
weston
and
the
colonel
they
must
marry
each
other
too
then
atkinson
can
continue
to
be
colonel
boucher
man
and
elizabeth
the
unless
she
is
busy
with
what
made
you
blush
then
they
can
get
help
in
you
will
lend
them
foljambe
for
instance
it
time
you
began
to
be
of
some
good
in
your
wicked
selfish
life
so
that
settled
it
only
remains
for
us
to
make
them
marry
each
other
are
you
getting
on
rather
fast
asked
georgie
i
not
getting
on
at
all
at
present
i
only
talking
come
into
my
house
instantly
and
we
drink
vermouth
vermouth
always
makes
me
brilliant
unless
it
makes
me
idiotic
but
we
hope
for
the
best
presently
they
were
seated
in
olga
with
a
bottle
of
vermouth
between
them
now
drink
fair
georgie
she
said
and
as
you
drink
tell
me
all
about
the
young
people
emotional
history
atkinson
and
elizabeth
asked
georgie
no
my
dear
colonel
boucher
and
mrs
weston
they
have
an
emotional
history
i
am
sure
you
all
thought
they
were
going
to
marry
each
other
once
and
they
constantly
dine
together
now
that
a
very
good
start
are
you
quite
sure
he
has
got
a
wife
and
family
in
egypt
or
she
a
husband
and
family
somewhere
else
i
do
want
to
rake
up
family
skeletons
i
never
heard
of
them
said
georgie
then
we
take
them
as
you
certainly
would
have
heard
of
them
if
there
were
any
and
very
likely
if
there
were
and
they
both
like
eating
drinking
and
the
latest
intelligence
do
they
yes
but
but
what
what
more
do
you
or
they
want
is
that
a
better
start
for
married
life
than
many
people
get
but
are
they
rather
old
asked
georgie
not
much
older
than
you
and
me
and
if
it
was
that
i
got
my
own
georgie
i
would
soon
have
somebody
else
do
you
know
who
i
mean
no
said
georgie
firmly
though
all
this
came
at
the
end
of
a
most
harrowing
day
it
or
the
vermouth
exhilarated
him
then
i
tell
you
just
what
mrs
weston
told
me
always
been
devoted
to
lucia
said
mrs
weston
he
has
never
looked
at
anybody
else
there
was
piggy
antrobus
now
do
you
know
who
i
mean
georgie
suddenly
giggled
yes
he
said
then
do
talk
about
yourself
so
much
my
dear
and
let
us
get
to
the
point
now
this
afternoon
i
dropped
in
to
see
mrs
weston
and
as
she
was
telling
me
about
the
tragedy
she
said
by
accident
just
as
i
called
you
georgie
just
now
by
accident
i
do
know
what
jacob
will
do
without
atkinson
now
is
or
is
not
colonel
boucher
name
jacob
there
you
are
then
that
one
side
of
the
question
she
called
him
jacob
by
accident
and
so
she
call
him
jacob
on
purpose
before
very
long
olga
nodded
her
head
up
and
down
in
precise
reproduction
of
mrs
weston
i
hardly
got
out
of
the
house
she
said
in
exact
imitation
of
mrs
weston
voice
before
i
met
colonel
boucher
it
would
have
been
about
three
no
it
could
have
been
three
because
i
had
got
back
home
and
was
standing
in
the
hall
when
it
struck
three
and
my
a
shade
fast
if
anything
well
colonel
boucher
said
to
me
hum
quite
a
domestic
crisis
by
jove
and
so
i
pretended
i
did
know
and
he
told
me
all
about
it
so
i
said
it
is
a
domestic
crisis
and
you
lose
atkinson
hum
said
he
poor
jane
i
should
say
mrs
weston
will
lose
elizabeth
there
she
got
up
and
lit
a
cigarette
oh
georgie
do
you
grasp
the
inwardness
of
that
she
said
their
dear
old
hearts
were
laid
bare
by
the
trouble
that
had
come
upon
them
and
each
of
them
spoke
of
the
other
as
each
felt
for
the
other
probably
neither
of
them
had
said
jacob
or
jane
in
the
whole
course
of
their
lives
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
descended
and
troubled
the
waters
if
you
think
that
profane
have
some
more
vermouth
making
me
brilliant
though
you
would
have
thought
it
now
listen
she
sat
down
again
close
to
him
her
face
brimming
with
a
humorous
enthusiasm
humour
in
riseholme
was
apt
to
be
a
little
unkind
if
you
mentioned
the
absurdities
of
your
friends
there
was
just
a
speck
of
malice
in
your
wit
but
with
her
there
was
none
of
that
she
gave
an
imitation
of
mrs
weston
with
the
most
ruthless
fidelity
and
yet
it
was
kindly
to
the
bottom
she
liked
her
for
talking
in
that
emphatic
voice
and
being
so
particular
as
to
what
time
it
was
now
first
of
all
you
are
coming
to
dine
with
me
tonight
said
olga
oh
i
afraid
that
tonight
began
georgie
shrinking
from
any
further
complications
he
really
must
have
a
quiet
evening
and
go
to
bed
very
early
what
are
you
afraid
of
tonight
she
asked
you
only
going
to
wash
your
hair
you
can
do
that
tomorrow
so
you
and
i
that
two
and
mrs
weston
and
colonel
jacob
that
four
which
is
enough
and
i
believe
there
anything
to
eat
in
the
house
but
there
something
to
drink
which
is
my
point
not
for
you
and
me
mind
we
got
to
keep
our
heads
and
be
clever
do
have
any
more
vermouth
but
jane
and
jacob
are
going
to
have
quantities
of
champagne
not
tipsy
you
understand
but
at
their
best
and
unguardedly
appreciative
of
each
other
and
us
and
when
they
go
away
they
will
exchange
a
chaste
kiss
at
mrs
weston
door
and
she
will
ask
him
in
no
i
think
she
ask
him
in
first
and
when
they
wake
up
tomorrow
morning
they
will
both
wonder
how
they
could
possibly
and
jointly
ask
themselves
what
everybody
else
will
say
and
then
they
thank
god
and
olga
and
georgie
that
they
did
and
live
happily
for
an
extraordinary
number
of
years
my
dear
how
infinitely
happier
they
will
be
together
than
they
are
being
now
funny
old
dears
each
at
its
own
fireside
saying
that
it
too
old
bless
them
and
you
and
i
will
sing
that
breathed
eden
and
in
the
middle
our
will
crack
and
we
will
sob
into
our
handkerchief
and
eden
will
be
left
breathing
deeply
all
by
itself
like
the
guru
why
did
you
never
tell
me
about
the
guru
mrs
weston
a
better
friend
to
me
than
you
are
and
i
must
ring
for
my
cook
no
i
telephone
first
to
jacob
and
jane
and
see
what
there
is
to
eat
afterwards
you
will
sit
here
quietly
and
when
i
have
finished
i
will
tell
you
what
your
part
is
during
dinner
according
to
olga
plan
of
campaign
the
conversation
was
to
be
general
because
she
hated
to
have
two
conversations
going
on
when
only
four
people
were
present
since
she
found
that
she
always
wanted
to
join
in
the
other
one
this
was
the
main
principle
she
inculcated
on
georgie
stamping
it
on
his
memory
by
a
simile
of
peculiar
vividness
imagine
there
is
an
elizabethan
spittoon
in
the
middle
of
the
table
she
said
and
keep
on
firmly
spitting
into
it
i
want
you
when
there
any
pause
to
spit
about
two
things
one
how
dreadfully
unhappy
both
jacob
and
jane
will
be
without
their
paragons
the
other
how
pleasant
is
conversation
and
companionship
i
shall
be
chaffing
you
mind
all
the
time
and
saying
must
get
married
after
dinner
i
shall
probably
stroll
in
the
garden
with
jacob
do
come
keep
him
after
dinner
for
some
little
time
for
then
my
opportunity
of
talking
to
jane
and
give
him
at
least
three
glasses
of
port
gracious
it
time
to
dress
and
the
lord
prosper
us
georgie
found
himself
the
last
to
arrive
when
he
got
back
to
and
all
three
of
them
shook
hands
rather
as
people
shake
hands
before
a
funeral
they
went
into
dinner
at
once
and
olga
instantly
began
how
many
years
did
you
say
your
admirable
atkinson
had
been
with
you
she
asked
colonel
boucher
twenty
getting
on
for
said
he
great
nuisance
my
word
it
worse
than
a
nuisance
georgie
had
a
bright
idea
but
what
a
nuisance
colonel
he
asked
eh
have
you
heard
i
thought
it
would
have
been
all
over
the
place
by
now
atkinson
going
to
be
married
no
said
georgie
whom
to
mrs
weston
could
not
bear
not
to
announce
this
herself
to
my
elizabeth
she
said
elizabeth
came
to
me
this
morning
i
speak
to
you
a
minute
she
asked
and
i
thought
nothing
more
than
that
perhaps
she
had
broken
a
said
i
quite
cheerfully
what
have
you
come
to
tell
me
it
was
getting
almost
too
tragic
and
olga
broke
in
let
try
to
forget
all
about
it
for
an
hour
or
two
she
said
it
was
nice
of
you
all
to
take
pity
on
me
and
come
and
have
dinner
otherwise
i
should
have
been
quite
alone
if
there
one
thing
i
can
not
bear
it
being
alone
in
the
evening
and
to
think
that
anybody
chooses
to
be
alone
when
he
need
look
at
that
wretch
there
and
she
pointed
to
georgie
who
lives
all
by
himself
instead
of
marrying
liking
to
be
alone
is
the
worst
habit
i
know
much
worse
than
drink
now
do
leave
me
alone
said
georgie
i
wo
my
dear
and
when
dinner
is
over
mrs
weston
and
i
are
going
to
put
our
heads
together
and
when
you
come
out
we
shall
announce
to
you
the
name
of
your
bride
i
should
put
a
tax
of
twenty
shillings
on
the
pound
on
all
bachelors
they
should
all
marry
or
starve
suddenly
she
turned
to
colonel
boucher
oh
colonel
she
said
what
have
i
been
saying
how
dreadfully
stupid
of
me
not
to
remember
that
you
were
a
bachelor
too
but
i
would
have
you
starve
for
anything
have
some
more
fish
instantly
to
shew
you
forgive
me
georgie
change
the
subject
you
always
talking
about
yourself
georgie
turned
with
admirable
docility
to
mrs
weston
it
too
miserable
for
you
he
said
how
will
you
get
on
without
elizabeth
how
long
has
she
been
with
you
mrs
weston
went
straight
back
to
where
she
had
left
off
so
i
said
have
you
come
to
tell
me
quite
cheerfully
thinking
it
was
a
and
she
said
going
to
be
married
and
she
blushed
so
prettily
that
you
have
thought
she
was
a
girl
of
twenty
though
she
was
seventeen
when
she
came
to
me
no
she
was
just
eighteen
and
that
fifteen
years
ago
and
that
makes
her
elizabeth
i
said
have
told
me
yet
who
it
is
but
whether
it
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
or
the
prince
of
wales
for
i
felt
i
had
to
make
a
little
joke
like
that
i
hope
you
make
him
as
happy
as
you
made
me
all
these
years
you
old
darling
said
olga
i
should
have
gone
into
hysterics
and
forbade
the
banns
no
miss
bracely
you
would
said
mrs
weston
you
have
been
just
as
thankful
as
me
that
she
got
a
good
husband
to
take
care
of
and
to
be
taken
care
of
by
because
then
she
said
none
of
they
not
them
great
folks
it
the
colonel
atkinson
you
ask
the
colonel
for
atkinson
character
miss
bracely
and
then
be
just
as
thankful
as
i
was
the
colonel
atkinson
is
a
slow
coach
just
like
georgie
said
olga
he
and
elizabeth
have
been
living
side
by
side
all
these
years
and
why
could
the
man
make
up
his
mind
before
the
only
redeeming
circumstance
is
that
he
has
done
it
now
our
poor
georgie
now
now
you
going
to
be
rude
to
colonel
boucher
again
said
georgie
colonel
we
been
asked
here
to
be
insulted
colonel
boucher
had
nothing
stronger
than
a
mild
tolerance
for
georgie
and
rather
enjoyed
snubbing
him
well
if
you
call
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
dinner
like
this
an
insult
he
said
my
word
i
do
know
what
you
call
a
compliment
i
know
what
i
call
a
compliment
said
olga
and
that
your
all
coming
to
dine
with
me
at
such
short
notice
about
approaching
nuptials
now
you
too
tarsome
said
he
if
you
go
on
like
that
i
sha
ask
you
to
the
wedding
let
talk
about
elizabeth
when
are
they
going
to
get
married
mrs
weston
that
what
i
said
to
elizabeth
an
almanack
elizabeth
said
i
that
you
wo
choose
a
sunday
do
say
the
of
next
month
without
looking
it
out
but
if
the
is
a
sunday
or
a
friday
mind
for
though
i
do
believe
in
such
things
still
you
never
know
there
was
mrs
antrobus
now
said
mrs
weston
suddenly
putting
in
a
footnote
to
her
speech
to
elizabeth
it
was
on
a
friday
she
married
and
within
a
year
she
got
as
deaf
as
you
see
her
now
then
mr
weston
uncle
his
uncle
by
marriage
i
should
say
he
was
another
friday
marriage
and
they
missed
their
train
when
going
off
on
their
honeymoon
and
had
to
stay
all
night
where
they
were
without
a
sponge
or
a
tooth
brush
between
them
for
all
their
luggage
was
in
the
train
being
whirled
away
to
torquay
make
it
the
elizabeth
i
said
it
is
a
friday
or
a
sunday
and
i
shall
have
time
to
look
round
me
and
so
will
the
colonel
though
i
do
expect
that
either
of
us
will
find
your
equals
and
do
cry
elizabeth
i
said
for
she
was
getting
quite
watery
if
you
cry
about
a
marriage
what
be
left
for
a
funeral
ha
upon
my
word
i
call
that
splendid
of
you
said
the
colonel
i
told
atkinson
i
wished
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
i
wished
him
joy
olga
got
up
look
after
colonel
boucher
georgie
she
said
and
ring
for
anything
you
want
look
at
the
moon
is
it
heavenly
how
atkinson
and
elizabeth
must
be
enjoying
it
the
two
men
spent
a
of
only
moderately
enjoyable
conversation
for
georgie
kept
the
grindstone
of
the
misery
of
his
lot
without
atkinson
and
the
pleasure
of
companionship
firmly
to
the
colonel
nose
it
was
no
use
for
him
to
attempt
to
change
the
subject
to
the
approaching
tableaux
to
a
vague
rumour
that
piggy
had
fallen
face
downwards
in
the
that
mrs
quantock
and
her
husband
had
turned
a
table
this
afternoon
with
remarkable
results
for
it
had
tapped
out
that
his
name
was
robert
and
hers
daisy
whichever
way
he
turned
georgie
herded
him
back
on
to
the
stony
path
that
he
had
been
bidden
to
take
with
the
result
that
when
georgie
finally
permitted
him
to
go
into
the
he
was
athirst
for
the
more
genial
companionship
of
the
ladies
olga
got
up
as
they
entered
georgie
so
lazy
she
said
that
it
no
use
asking
him
but
do
let
you
and
me
have
a
turn
up
and
down
my
garden
colonel
there
a
divine
moon
and
it
quite
warm
they
stepped
out
into
the
windless
night
fancy
it
being
october
she
said
i
do
believe
there
is
any
winter
in
riseholme
nor
autumn
either
for
that
matter
you
are
all
so
young
so
deliciously
young
look
at
georgie
in
there
he
like
a
boy
still
and
as
for
mrs
weston
she
not
a
day
older
yes
wonderful
woman
said
he
always
agreeable
and
lively
handsome
too
i
consider
mrs
weston
a
very
handsome
woman
altered
an
atom
since
i
knew
her
that
the
wonderful
thing
about
you
all
said
she
you
are
all
just
as
brisk
and
young
as
you
were
ten
years
ago
it
ridiculous
as
for
you
i
not
sure
that
you
not
the
most
ridiculous
of
the
lot
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
having
dinner
with
three
delightful
cousins
a
little
younger
not
much
but
just
a
little
than
myself
gracious
how
you
all
made
me
romp
the
other
night
here
what
a
pace
you
go
colonel
what
your
walking
like
if
you
call
this
a
stroll
colonel
boucher
moderated
his
pace
he
thought
olga
had
been
walking
so
quickly
i
very
sorry
he
said
certainly
riseholme
is
a
healthy
bracing
place
perhaps
we
do
keep
our
youth
pretty
well
god
bless
me
but
the
days
go
by
without
one
noticing
them
to
think
that
i
came
here
with
atkinson
close
on
ten
years
ago
this
did
very
well
for
olga
she
swiftly
switched
off
onto
it
it
quite
horrid
for
you
losing
your
servant
she
said
servants
do
become
friends
do
they
especially
to
anyone
living
alone
georgie
and
foljambe
now
but
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
foljambe
had
a
mistress
before
very
long
no
really
i
thought
you
were
just
chaffing
him
at
dinner
georgie
marrying
is
he
his
wife
take
some
of
his
needlework
off
his
hands
may
i
ah
may
i
enquire
the
lady
name
olga
decided
to
play
a
great
card
she
had
just
found
it
so
to
speak
in
her
hand
and
it
was
most
tempting
she
stopped
but
ca
you
guess
she
said
surely
i
not
absolutely
on
the
wrong
track
ah
miss
antrobus
said
he
the
one
i
think
they
call
piggy
no
i
should
say
there
was
nothing
in
that
oh
that
had
never
occurred
to
me
said
she
i
daresay
i
quite
wrong
i
only
judged
from
what
i
thought
i
noticed
in
poor
georgie
i
daresay
it
only
what
he
should
have
done
ten
years
ago
but
i
fancy
there
a
spark
alive
still
let
us
talk
about
something
else
though
we
wo
go
in
quite
yet
shall
we
she
felt
quite
safe
in
her
apparent
reluctance
to
tell
him
the
riseholme
gluttony
for
news
made
it
imperative
for
him
to
ask
more
really
i
must
be
very
dull
he
said
i
daresay
an
eye
new
to
the
place
sees
more
who
is
it
miss
bracely
she
laughed
ah
how
bad
a
man
is
at
observing
a
man
she
said
did
you
see
georgie
at
dinner
he
hardly
took
his
eyes
off
her
she
had
a
great
and
glorious
reward
colonel
boucher
face
grew
absolutely
blank
in
the
moonlight
with
sheer
astonishment
well
you
surprise
me
he
said
surely
a
fine
woman
though
lame
would
look
at
a
well
leave
it
at
that
he
stamped
his
feet
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
it
growing
a
bit
chilly
he
said
you
be
catching
cold
miss
bracely
and
what
will
your
husband
say
if
he
finds
out
i
been
strolling
about
with
you
out
of
doors
after
dinner
yes
we
go
in
she
said
it
is
chilly
how
thoughtful
you
are
for
me
georgie
little
knowing
the
catspaw
that
had
been
made
of
him
found
himself
being
detached
from
mrs
weston
by
the
colonel
and
this
suited
him
very
well
for
presently
olga
said
she
would
sing
unless
anybody
minded
and
called
on
him
to
accompany
her
she
stood
just
behind
him
leaning
over
him
sometimes
with
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
sang
three
ruthless
simple
english
songs
appropriate
to
the
matter
in
hand
she
sang
i
attempt
from
love
sickness
to
fly
and
sally
in
our
alley
and
come
live
with
me
and
sometimes
beneath
the
rustle
of
leaves
turned
over
she
whispered
to
him
georgie
i
cleverer
than
anybody
ever
was
and
i
shall
die
in
the
night
she
said
once
again
more
enigmatically
she
said
i
been
a
cad
but
i
tell
you
about
it
when
they
gone
stop
behind
and
then
some
whiskey
came
in
and
she
insisted
on
the
young
people
having
some
of
that
finally
she
saw
them
off
at
the
door
and
came
running
back
to
georgie
i
been
a
cad
she
said
because
i
hinted
that
you
were
in
love
with
mrs
weston
my
dear
it
was
simply
perfect
i
believe
it
to
have
been
the
last
straw
and
if
you
do
forgive
me
you
need
was
it
clever
he
simply
could
stand
that
for
it
came
on
the
top
of
your
being
so
young
well
really
said
georgie
i
know
and
i
must
be
a
cad
again
i
going
up
to
my
bedroom
you
may
come
too
if
you
like
because
it
commands
a
view
of
church
road
i
should
sleep
a
wink
unless
i
knew
that
he
had
gone
in
with
her
it
be
precisely
like
faust
and
marguerite
going
into
the
house
and
you
and
i
are
mephistopheles
and
martha
come
quick
from
the
dark
of
the
window
they
watched
mrs
weston
being
pushed
up
the
lit
road
it
the
colonel
pushing
it
whispered
olga
squeezing
him
into
a
corner
of
the
window
look
there
tommy
luton
on
the
path
now
they
stopped
at
her
gate
i
ca
bear
the
suspense
oh
georgie
they
gone
in
and
atkinson
will
stop
and
so
will
elizabeth
and
you
promised
to
lend
them
foljambe
which
house
will
they
live
at
do
you
think
are
you
happy
chapter
twelve
the
miserable
lucia
started
a
run
of
extreme
bad
luck
about
this
time
of
which
the
adventure
or
misadventure
of
the
guru
seemed
to
be
the
prelude
or
perhaps
the
news
of
her
want
of
recognition
of
the
august
moon
which
georgie
had
so
carefully
saluted
may
have
arrived
at
that
satellite
by
october
for
she
had
simply
cut
the
august
moon
there
was
the
fiasco
about
olga
coming
to
the
tableaux
which
was
the
cause
of
her
sending
that
very
tart
reply
via
miss
lyall
to
lady
ambermere
impertinence
and
the
very
next
morning
lady
ambermere
coming
again
into
riseholme
perhaps
for
that
very
purpose
had
behaved
to
lucia
as
lucia
had
behaved
to
the
moon
and
cut
her
that
was
irritating
but
the
to
it
had
been
that
lady
ambermere
had
then
gone
to
olga
and
been
told
that
she
was
not
at
home
though
she
was
very
audibly
practising
in
her
at
the
time
upon
which
lady
ambermere
had
said
home
to
her
people
and
got
in
with
such
unconcern
of
the
material
world
that
she
sat
down
on
pug
mrs
quantock
had
heard
both
home
and
pug
and
told
the
cut
lucia
who
was
a
hundred
yards
away
about
it
she
also
told
her
about
the
engagement
of
atkinson
and
elizabeth
which
was
all
she
knew
about
events
in
those
houses
on
which
lucia
with
a
kind
smile
had
said
dear
daisy
what
slaves
some
people
are
to
their
servants
i
am
sure
mrs
weston
and
colonel
boucher
will
be
quite
miserable
poor
things
now
i
must
run
home
how
i
wish
i
could
stop
and
chat
on
the
green
and
she
gave
her
silvery
laugh
for
she
felt
much
better
now
that
she
knew
olga
had
said
she
was
out
to
lady
ambermere
when
she
was
so
audibly
in
then
came
a
second
piece
of
bad
luck
lucia
had
not
gone
more
than
a
hundred
yards
past
georgie
house
when
he
came
out
in
a
tremendous
hurry
he
rapidly
measured
the
distance
between
himself
and
lucia
and
himself
and
mrs
quantock
and
made
a
for
mrs
quantock
since
she
was
the
nearest
olga
had
just
telephoned
to
him
good
morning
he
said
breathlessly
determined
to
cap
anything
she
said
any
news
yes
indeed
she
said
have
you
heard
georgie
had
one
moment
of
what
he
said
atkinson
and
eliz
she
began
oh
that
said
he
scornfully
and
talking
of
them
of
course
heard
the
rest
you
why
mrs
weston
and
colonel
boucher
are
going
to
follow
their
example
unless
they
set
it
themselves
and
get
married
first
no
said
mrs
quantock
in
the
loudest
possible
riseholme
voice
of
surprise
oh
yes
i
really
knew
it
last
night
i
was
dining
at
old
place
and
they
were
there
olga
and
i
both
settled
there
would
be
something
to
talk
in
the
morning
shall
we
stroll
on
the
green
a
few
minutes
georgie
had
a
lovely
time
he
hurried
from
person
to
person
leaving
mrs
quantock
to
pick
up
a
few
further
gleanings
everyone
was
there
except
lucia
and
she
but
for
the
accident
of
her
being
further
off
than
mrs
quantock
would
have
been
the
first
to
know
when
this
tour
was
finished
georgie
sat
to
enjoy
the
warm
comforting
glow
of
envy
that
surrounded
him
nowadays
the
meeting
place
at
the
green
had
insensibly
transferred
itself
to
just
opposite
old
place
and
it
was
extremely
interesting
to
hear
olga
practising
as
she
always
did
in
the
morning
interesting
though
it
was
riseholme
had
at
first
been
a
little
disappointed
about
it
for
everyone
had
thought
that
she
would
sing
brunnhilde
part
or
salome
part
through
every
day
or
some
trifle
of
that
kind
instead
she
would
perform
an
upwards
scale
in
gradual
and
on
the
highest
most
magnificent
note
would
enunciate
at
the
top
of
her
voice
yawning
york
then
starting
soft
again
she
would
descend
in
to
a
superb
low
note
and
enunciate
love
lilies
lonely
then
after
a
dozen
repetitions
of
this
she
would
start
off
with
full
voice
and
get
softer
and
softer
until
she
just
whispered
that
york
was
yawning
and
do
the
same
with
love
lilies
but
you
never
could
tell
what
she
might
not
sing
and
some
mornings
there
would
be
long
trills
and
leapings
onto
high
notes
long
notes
and
leaping
onto
trills
and
occasionally
she
sang
a
real
song
that
was
worth
waiting
for
and
georgie
did
not
hesitate
to
let
drop
that
she
had
sung
four
last
night
to
his
accompaniment
and
hardly
had
he
repeated
that
the
third
time
when
she
appeared
at
her
window
and
before
all
riseholme
called
out
georgie
with
a
trill
at
the
end
like
a
bird
shaking
its
wings
before
all
riseholme
so
in
he
went
had
lucia
known
that
it
would
quite
have
wiped
the
gilt
off
lady
ambermere
being
refused
admittance
in
point
of
fact
it
did
wipe
the
gilt
off
when
about
an
hour
afterwards
georgie
went
to
lunch
because
he
told
her
and
if
there
had
been
any
gilt
left
about
anywhere
that
would
have
vanished
too
when
in
answer
to
some
rather
damaging
remark
she
made
about
poor
daisy
interests
in
the
of
other
people
servants
she
learned
that
it
was
of
the
of
their
superiors
that
all
riseholme
had
been
talking
for
at
least
an
hour
by
now
again
there
was
about
the
tableaux
on
saturday
for
in
the
brunnhilde
scene
peppino
in
his
agitation
turned
the
lamp
that
was
to
be
a
sunrise
completely
out
and
brunnhilde
had
to
hail
the
midnight
or
at
any
rate
a
very
obscure
twilight
georgie
it
is
true
with
wonderful
presence
of
mind
turned
on
an
electric
light
when
he
had
finished
playing
but
it
was
more
like
a
flash
of
lightning
than
a
slow
wonderful
dawn
the
tableaux
were
over
well
before
and
though
lucia
in
answer
to
the
usual
pressings
said
she
would
see
about
doing
them
again
she
felt
that
mrs
weston
and
colonel
boucher
who
made
their
first
public
appearance
as
the
happy
pair
attracted
more
than
their
proper
share
of
attention
the
only
consolation
was
that
the
romps
that
followed
at
poor
daisy
were
a
complete
fiasco
it
was
in
vain
too
at
supper
that
she
went
from
table
to
table
and
helped
people
to
lobster
salad
and
champagne
and
had
not
enough
chairs
and
generally
imitated
all
that
had
apparently
made
olga
party
so
supreme
a
success
but
on
this
occasion
the
recipe
for
the
dish
and
not
the
dish
itself
was
served
up
and
the
hunting
of
the
slipper
produced
no
exhilaration
in
the
chase
but
far
more
untoward
events
followed
olga
came
back
on
the
next
monday
and
immediately
after
lucia
received
a
card
for
an
evening
at
home
with
music
in
the
bottom
corner
it
happened
to
be
wet
that
afternoon
and
seeing
olga
shut
motor
coming
from
the
station
with
four
men
inside
she
leaped
to
the
conclusion
that
these
were
four
musicians
for
the
music
a
second
motor
followed
with
luggage
and
she
quite
distinctly
saw
the
unmistakable
shape
of
a
against
the
window
after
that
no
more
guessing
was
necessary
for
it
was
clear
that
poor
olga
had
hired
the
awful
from
brinton
that
played
in
the
lounge
at
the
royal
hotel
after
dinner
the
brinton
she
had
heard
them
once
at
a
distance
and
that
was
quite
enough
lucia
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
those
doleful
fiddlers
it
was
indeed
strange
that
olga
with
all
the
opportunities
she
had
had
for
hearing
good
music
should
hire
the
brinton
but
after
all
that
was
entirely
of
a
piece
with
her
views
about
the
gramophone
perhaps
the
gramophone
would
have
its
share
in
this
musical
evening
but
she
had
said
she
would
go
it
would
be
very
unkind
to
olga
to
stop
away
now
for
olga
must
know
by
this
time
her
passion
for
music
so
she
went
she
sincerely
hoped
that
she
would
not
be
conducted
to
the
seat
of
honour
and
be
obliged
to
say
a
few
encouraging
words
to
the
afterwards
once
again
she
came
rather
late
for
the
music
had
begun
it
had
only
just
begun
for
she
recognised
who
should
recognise
if
not
she
the
early
bars
of
a
beethoven
quartet
she
laid
her
hand
on
peppino
arm
brinton
beethoven
she
said
limply
she
slipped
into
a
chair
next
daisy
quantock
and
sat
in
her
position
when
listening
to
music
with
her
head
forward
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
nothing
of
course
could
wholly
take
away
the
splendour
of
that
glorious
composition
and
she
was
pleased
that
there
was
no
applause
between
the
movements
for
she
had
rather
expected
that
olga
would
clap
and
interrupt
the
unity
of
it
all
occasionally
too
she
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
brinton
they
seemed
to
have
some
inklings
though
not
many
once
she
winced
very
much
when
a
string
broke
olga
she
was
rather
a
restless
hostess
came
up
to
her
when
it
was
over
so
glad
you
could
come
she
said
are
they
divine
lucia
gave
her
most
indulgent
smile
perfect
music
glorious
she
said
and
they
really
played
it
very
creditably
but
i
am
a
little
spoiled
you
know
for
the
last
time
i
heard
that
it
was
performed
by
the
spanish
quartet
i
know
one
ought
never
to
compare
but
have
you
ever
heard
the
spanish
quartet
miss
bracely
olga
looked
at
her
in
surprise
but
they
are
the
spanish
quartet
she
said
pointing
to
the
players
lucia
had
raised
her
voice
rather
as
she
spoke
for
when
she
spoke
on
music
she
spoke
for
everybody
to
hear
and
a
great
many
people
undoubtedly
did
hear
among
whom
of
course
was
daisy
quantock
she
gave
one
shrill
squeal
of
laughter
like
a
and
from
that
moment
granted
plenary
absolution
to
dear
for
all
her
greed
and
grabbing
with
regard
to
the
guru
but
instantly
all
olga
awoke
unwittingly
for
her
remark
that
this
the
spanish
quartet
had
been
a
mere
surprised
exclamation
she
had
made
a
guest
of
hers
uncomfortable
and
must
at
once
do
all
she
could
to
remedy
that
it
a
shocking
room
for
echoes
this
she
said
do
all
of
you
come
up
a
little
nearer
and
you
will
be
able
to
hear
the
playing
so
much
better
you
lose
all
shade
all
fineness
here
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
ask
you
to
move
up
mrs
lucas
there
are
half
a
dozen
chairs
unoccupied
near
the
platform
it
was
a
kindly
intention
that
prompted
the
speech
but
for
all
real
riseholme
practical
purposes
quite
barren
for
many
people
had
heard
lucia
remarks
and
peppino
also
had
already
been
wincing
at
the
brinton
quartet
in
that
fell
moment
the
bolshevists
laid
bony
fingers
on
the
sceptre
of
her
musical
autocracy
but
who
would
have
guessed
that
olga
would
get
the
spanish
quartet
from
london
to
come
down
to
riseholme
staggering
from
these
blows
she
had
to
undergo
an
even
shrewder
stroke
yet
already
in
the
intelligence
department
she
had
been
sadly
in
news
her
had
been
anything
but
a
success
this
one
little
remark
of
olga
had
shaken
her
musically
but
at
any
rate
up
till
this
moment
she
had
shewn
herself
mistress
of
the
italian
tongue
while
to
strengthen
that
she
was
being
very
diligent
with
her
dictionary
grammar
and
dante
paradiso
then
as
by
a
bolt
out
of
a
clear
sky
that
temple
too
was
completely
demolished
in
the
most
tragic
fashion
a
few
days
after
the
disaster
of
the
quartet
olga
received
a
letter
from
signor
cortese
the
eminent
italian
composer
to
herald
the
completion
of
his
opera
lucretia
might
he
come
down
to
riseholme
for
a
couple
of
nights
and
figuratively
lay
it
at
her
feet
in
the
hope
that
she
would
raise
it
up
and
usher
it
into
the
world
all
the
time
he
had
been
writing
it
as
she
knew
he
had
thought
of
her
in
the
name
part
and
he
would
come
down
today
tomorrow
at
a
moment
notice
by
day
or
night
to
submit
it
to
her
olga
was
delighted
and
sent
an
effusive
telegram
of
many
sheets
full
of
congratulation
and
welcome
for
she
wanted
above
all
things
to
create
the
part
so
would
signor
cortese
come
down
that
very
day
she
ran
upstairs
with
the
news
to
her
husband
my
dear
is
finished
she
said
and
that
angel
practically
offers
it
me
now
what
are
we
to
do
about
dinner
tonight
jacob
and
jane
are
coming
and
neither
you
nor
they
i
suppose
speak
one
word
of
italian
and
you
know
what
mine
is
firm
and
intelligible
and
operatic
but
not
conversational
what
are
we
to
do
he
hates
talking
english
oh
i
know
if
i
can
only
get
mrs
lucas
they
always
talk
italian
i
believe
at
home
i
wonder
if
she
can
come
she
musical
too
and
i
shall
ask
her
husband
i
think
that
be
a
man
over
but
it
will
be
another
italiano
olga
wrote
at
once
to
lucia
mentioning
that
cortese
was
staying
with
them
but
quite
naturally
saying
nothing
about
the
usefulness
of
peppino
and
her
being
able
to
engage
the
musician
in
his
own
tongue
for
that
she
took
for
granted
an
eager
affirmative
such
a
great
pleasure
came
back
to
her
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
lucia
and
peppino
made
up
neat
little
sentences
to
let
off
to
the
dazzled
cortese
at
the
moment
when
they
said
to
shew
that
they
could
have
talked
italian
all
the
time
had
there
been
any
occasion
for
doing
so
mrs
weston
and
colonel
boucher
had
already
arrived
when
lucia
and
her
husband
entered
and
lucia
had
quite
a
shock
to
see
on
what
intimate
terms
they
were
with
their
hostess
they
actually
called
each
other
olga
and
jacob
and
jane
which
was
most
surprising
and
almost
painful
lucia
perhaps
because
she
had
not
known
about
it
soon
enough
had
been
a
little
satirical
about
the
engagement
rather
as
if
it
was
a
slight
on
her
that
jacob
had
not
been
content
with
celibacy
and
jane
with
her
friendship
but
she
was
sure
she
wished
them
both
nothing
but
well
indeed
the
moment
she
got
over
the
shock
of
seeing
them
so
intimate
with
olga
she
could
not
have
been
surpassed
in
cordiality
we
see
but
little
of
our
old
friends
now
she
said
to
olga
and
jane
jointly
but
we
must
excuse
their
desire
for
solitude
in
their
first
glow
of
their
happiness
peppino
and
i
remember
that
sweet
time
oh
ever
so
long
ago
this
might
have
been
tact
or
it
might
have
been
cat
that
peppino
and
she
sympathised
as
they
remembered
their
beautiful
time
was
tact
that
it
was
so
long
ago
was
cat
altogether
it
might
be
described
as
a
cat
chewing
tact
but
there
was
a
slight
air
of
patronage
about
it
and
if
there
was
one
thing
mrs
weston
would
not
and
could
not
and
did
not
even
intend
to
stand
it
was
that
besides
it
had
reached
her
ears
that
mrs
lucas
had
said
something
about
there
being
no
difficulty
in
finding
bridesmaids
younger
than
the
bride
fancy
how
clever
of
you
to
remember
so
long
ago
she
said
but
then
you
have
the
most
marvellous
memory
dear
and
keep
it
wonderfully
olga
intervened
how
kind
of
you
and
mr
lucas
to
come
at
such
short
notice
she
said
cortese
hates
talking
english
so
i
shall
put
him
between
you
and
me
and
you
talk
to
him
all
the
time
wo
you
and
you
wo
laugh
at
me
will
you
when
i
join
in
with
my
atrocious
attempts
and
i
shall
buttress
myself
on
the
other
side
with
your
husband
who
will
firmly
talk
across
me
to
him
lucia
had
to
say
something
a
further
exposure
was
at
hand
quite
inevitably
it
was
no
use
for
her
and
peppino
to
recollect
a
previous
engagement
oh
my
italian
is
terribly
rusty
she
said
knowing
that
mrs
eye
was
on
her
why
had
she
not
sent
mrs
weston
a
handsome
that
morning
rusty
we
will
ask
cortese
about
that
when
you
had
a
good
talk
to
him
ah
here
he
is
cortese
came
into
the
room
florid
and
loquacious
pouring
out
a
stream
of
apology
for
his
lateness
to
olga
none
of
which
was
the
least
intelligible
to
lucia
she
guessed
what
he
was
saying
and
next
moment
olga
who
apparently
understood
him
perfectly
and
told
him
with
an
enviable
fluency
that
he
was
not
late
at
all
was
introducing
him
to
her
and
explaining
that
la
signora
lucia
understood
this
and
her
husband
talked
italian
she
did
not
need
to
reply
to
some
torrent
of
amiable
words
from
him
addressed
to
her
for
he
was
taken
on
and
introduced
to
mrs
weston
and
the
colonel
but
he
instantly
whirled
round
to
her
again
and
asked
her
something
not
knowing
the
least
what
he
meant
she
replied
si
tante
grazie
he
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
and
then
repeated
his
question
in
english
in
what
deestrict
of
italy
you
voyaged
most
lucia
understood
that
so
did
mrs
weston
and
lucia
pulled
herself
together
in
rome
she
said
bella
citta
adoro
roma
e
il
mio
marito
non
e
vere
peppino
peppino
cordially
assented
the
familiar
ring
of
this
fine
intelligible
italian
restored
his
confidence
and
he
asked
cortese
whether
he
was
not
very
fond
of
music
dinner
seemed
interminable
to
lucia
she
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
cortese
and
if
she
saw
he
was
about
to
speak
to
her
she
turned
hastily
to
colonel
boucher
who
sat
on
her
other
side
and
asked
him
something
about
his
which
she
translated
to
him
while
he
answered
she
made
up
another
sentence
in
italian
about
the
blue
sky
or
venice
or
very
meanly
said
her
husband
had
been
there
hoping
to
direct
the
torrent
of
italian
eloquence
to
him
but
she
knew
that
as
an
italian
conversationalist
neither
she
nor
peppino
had
a
rag
of
reputation
left
them
and
she
dismally
regretted
that
they
had
not
chosen
french
of
which
they
both
knew
about
as
much
instead
of
italian
for
the
vehicle
of
their
linguistic
distinction
olga
meantime
continued
to
understand
all
that
cortese
said
and
to
reply
to
it
with
odious
fluency
and
at
the
last
cortese
having
said
something
to
her
which
made
her
laugh
he
turned
to
lucia
i
said
to
meesis
shottlewort
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
his
joke
in
english
molto
bene
said
lucia
with
a
dying
flicker
molto
divertente
non
e
vero
peppino
si
si
said
peppino
miserably
and
then
the
final
disgrace
came
and
it
was
something
of
a
relief
to
have
it
over
cortese
in
excellent
spirits
with
his
dinner
and
his
wine
and
the
prospect
of
olga
taking
the
part
of
lucretia
turned
beamingly
to
lucia
again
now
we
will
all
spick
english
he
said
this
is
one
very
pleasant
evening
i
enjoy
me
very
much
ecco
just
once
more
lucia
shot
up
into
flame
parlate
inglese
molto
bene
she
said
and
except
when
cortese
spoke
to
olga
there
was
no
more
italian
that
night
even
the
unique
excitement
of
hearing
olga
try
over
the
great
scene
in
the
last
act
could
not
quite
absorb
lucia
attention
after
this
awful
fiasco
and
though
she
sat
leaning
forward
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
her
mind
was
furiously
busy
as
to
how
to
make
anything
whatever
out
of
so
bad
a
job
everyone
present
knew
that
her
italian
as
a
medium
for
conversation
had
suffered
a
complete
and
it
was
no
longer
any
real
use
when
olga
did
not
quite
catch
the
rhythm
of
a
passage
to
murmur
unconsciously
to
herself
she
might
just
as
well
have
said
one
two
three
for
any
effect
it
had
on
mrs
weston
the
story
would
be
all
over
riseholme
next
day
and
she
felt
sure
that
mrs
weston
that
excellent
observer
and
superb
reporter
had
not
failed
to
take
it
all
in
and
would
not
fail
to
do
justice
to
it
blow
after
blow
had
been
rained
upon
her
palace
door
it
was
little
wonder
that
the
whole
building
was
she
had
thought
of
starting
a
this
winter
for
printed
italian
if
you
had
a
dictionary
and
a
translation
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
class
could
be
easily
interpreted
it
was
the
spoken
word
which
you
had
to
understand
without
any
preparation
at
all
and
not
in
the
least
knowing
what
was
coming
that
had
presented
such
insurmountable
difficulties
and
yet
who
when
the
story
of
this
evening
was
known
would
seek
instruction
from
a
teacher
of
that
sort
would
mrs
weston
come
to
her
would
she
would
she
no
she
would
not
lucia
lay
long
awake
that
night
tossing
and
turning
in
her
bed
in
that
delightful
apartment
in
midsummer
night
dream
and
reviewing
the
fell
array
of
these
unlucky
affairs
as
she
eyed
them
black
shapes
against
the
glow
of
her
firelight
it
struck
her
that
the
same
malevolent
influence
inspired
them
all
for
what
had
caused
the
failure
and
flatness
of
her
tableaux
omitting
the
unfortunate
incident
about
the
lamp
but
the
absence
of
olga
who
was
it
who
had
occasioned
her
unfortunate
remark
about
the
spanish
quartet
but
olga
whose
clear
duty
it
had
been
when
she
sent
the
invitation
for
the
musical
party
to
state
so
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
that
those
eminent
performers
were
to
entrance
them
who
could
have
guessed
that
she
would
have
gone
to
the
staggering
expense
of
having
them
down
from
london
the
brinton
quartet
was
the
utmost
that
any
sane
imagination
could
have
pictured
and
lucia
extremely
sane
imagination
had
pictured
just
that
with
such
extreme
vividness
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
it
could
be
anybody
else
certainly
olga
should
have
put
spanish
quartet
in
the
bottom
corner
instead
of
music
and
then
lucia
would
have
known
all
about
it
and
have
been
speechless
with
emotion
when
they
had
finished
the
beethoven
and
wiped
her
eyes
and
pulled
herself
together
again
it
really
looked
as
if
olga
had
laid
a
trap
for
her
even
more
like
a
trap
were
the
horrid
events
of
this
evening
trap
was
not
at
all
too
strong
a
word
for
them
to
ask
her
to
the
house
and
then
suddenly
spring
upon
her
the
fact
that
she
was
expected
to
talk
italian
was
that
an
open
an
honourable
proceeding
what
if
lucia
had
actually
told
olga
and
she
seemed
to
recollect
it
that
she
and
peppino
often
talked
italian
at
home
that
was
no
reason
why
she
should
be
expected
like
that
to
talk
italian
anywhere
else
she
should
have
been
told
what
was
expected
of
her
so
as
to
give
her
the
chance
of
having
a
previous
engagement
lucia
hated
underhand
ways
and
they
were
particularly
odious
in
one
whom
she
had
been
willing
to
educate
and
refine
up
to
the
highest
standards
of
riseholme
indeed
it
looked
as
if
olga
nature
was
actually
incapable
of
receiving
cultivation
she
went
on
her
own
rough
independent
lines
giving
a
romp
one
night
and
not
coming
to
the
tableaux
on
another
and
getting
the
spanish
quartet
without
consultation
on
a
third
and
springing
this
dreadful
pentecostal
party
on
them
on
a
fourth
olga
clearly
meant
mischief
she
wanted
to
set
herself
up
as
leader
of
art
and
culture
in
riseholme
her
conduct
admitted
of
no
other
explanation
lucia
benevolent
scheme
of
educating
and
refining
vanished
like
morning
mists
and
through
her
drooping
eyelids
the
firelight
seemed
strangely
red
she
had
been
too
kind
too
encouraging
now
she
must
collect
her
forces
round
her
and
be
stern
as
she
dozed
off
to
sleep
she
reminded
herself
to
ask
georgie
to
lunch
next
day
he
and
peppino
and
she
must
have
a
serious
talk
she
had
seen
georgie
comparatively
little
just
lately
and
she
drowsily
and
uneasily
wondered
how
that
was
georgie
by
this
time
had
quite
got
over
the
desolation
of
the
moment
when
standing
in
the
road
opposite
mrs
quantock
he
had
given
vent
to
that
bitter
cry
of
more
misery
more
unhappiness
his
nerves
on
that
occasion
had
been
worn
to
fiddlestrings
with
all
the
fuss
and
fiasco
of
planning
the
tableaux
and
thus
fancying
himself
in
love
had
been
just
the
last
straw
but
the
fact
that
he
had
been
chosen
confidant
in
her
wonderful
scheme
of
causing
mrs
weston
and
the
colonel
to
get
engaged
and
the
distinction
of
being
singled
out
by
olga
to
this
friendly
intimacy
had
proved
a
great
tonic
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
existence
of
mr
shuttleworth
constituted
a
hopeless
bar
to
the
fruition
of
his
passion
and
if
he
was
completely
honest
with
himself
he
was
aware
that
he
did
not
really
hate
mr
shuttleworth
for
standing
in
his
path
georgie
was
gentle
in
all
his
ways
and
his
manner
of
falling
in
love
was
very
gentle
too
he
admired
olga
immensely
he
found
her
stimulating
and
amusing
and
since
it
was
out
of
the
question
really
to
be
her
lover
he
would
have
enjoyed
next
best
to
that
being
her
brother
and
such
little
pangs
of
jealousy
as
he
might
experience
from
time
to
time
were
rather
in
the
nature
of
small
electric
shocks
voluntarily
received
he
was
devoted
to
her
with
a
warmth
that
his
supposed
devotion
to
lucia
had
never
kindled
in
him
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
dream
about
her
in
an
agitated
though
respectful
manner
without
being
conscious
of
any
unreality
about
his
sentiments
he
really
wanted
to
dress
up
as
a
lover
rather
than
to
be
one
for
he
could
form
no
notion
at
present
of
what
it
felt
to
be
absorbed
in
anyone
else
life
was
so
full
as
it
was
there
really
was
no
room
for
anything
else
especially
if
that
something
else
must
be
of
the
quality
which
rendered
everything
else
colourless
this
state
of
mind
this
quality
of
emotion
was
wholly
pleasurable
and
quite
exciting
and
instead
of
crying
out
more
misery
more
unhappiness
he
could
now
as
he
passed
the
mulberry
say
to
himself
more
pleasures
more
happiness
yet
as
he
ran
down
the
road
to
lunch
with
lucia
he
was
conscious
that
she
was
likely
to
stand
an
angel
perhaps
but
certainly
one
with
a
flaming
sword
between
him
and
all
the
interests
of
the
new
life
which
was
undoubtedly
beginning
to
bubble
in
riseholme
and
to
which
georgie
found
it
so
pleasant
to
take
his
little
mug
and
have
it
filled
with
exhilarating
liquid
and
if
lucia
proved
to
be
standing
in
his
path
forbidding
his
approach
he
too
was
armed
for
combat
with
a
revolutionary
weapon
consisting
of
a
copy
of
some
of
debussy
music
for
the
piano
olga
had
lent
it
him
a
few
days
and
he
had
been
very
busy
over
poissons
he
was
further
armed
by
the
complete
knowledge
of
the
italian
debacle
of
last
night
which
from
his
knowledge
of
lucia
he
judged
must
constitute
a
crisis
something
would
have
to
happen
several
times
lately
olga
had
so
to
speak
run
into
lucia
and
had
passed
on
leaving
a
staggering
form
behind
her
and
in
each
case
so
georgie
clearly
perceived
olga
had
not
intended
to
butt
into
or
stagger
anybody
each
time
she
had
knocked
lucia
down
purely
by
accident
but
if
these
accidents
occurred
with
such
awful
frequency
it
was
to
be
expected
that
lucia
would
find
another
name
for
them
they
would
have
to
be
christened
with
all
his
riseholme
appetite
for
complications
and
events
georgie
guessed
that
he
was
not
likely
to
go
empty
away
from
this
lunch
in
addition
there
were
other
topics
of
extraordinary
interest
for
really
there
had
been
very
odd
experiences
at
mrs
quantock
last
night
when
the
italian
debacle
was
going
on
a
little
way
up
the
road
but
he
was
not
going
to
bring
that
out
at
once
lucia
hailed
him
with
her
most
cordial
manner
and
with
a
superb
effrontery
began
to
talk
italian
just
as
usual
though
she
must
have
guessed
that
georgie
knew
all
about
last
night
bon
arrivato
amico
mio
she
said
why
it
must
be
three
days
since
we
met
che
la
falto
il
signorino
and
what
have
you
got
there
georgie
having
escaped
being
caught
over
italian
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
talk
any
more
ever
oh
they
are
some
little
things
by
debussy
he
said
i
want
to
play
one
of
them
to
you
afterwards
i
just
been
glancing
through
it
bene
molto
bene
said
she
come
in
to
lunch
but
i
ca
promise
to
like
it
georgino
is
debussy
the
man
who
always
makes
me
want
to
howl
like
a
dog
at
the
sound
of
the
gong
where
did
you
get
these
from
olga
lent
me
them
said
georgie
negligently
he
really
did
call
her
olga
to
her
face
now
by
request
lucia
bugles
began
to
sound
yes
i
should
think
miss
bracely
would
admire
that
sort
of
music
she
said
i
suppose
i
am
too
though
i
will
not
condemn
your
little
pieces
of
debussy
before
i
have
heard
them
yes
i
was
certainly
too
for
the
music
she
gave
us
last
night
dio
mi
oh
did
you
enjoy
it
asked
he
lucia
sat
down
without
waiting
for
peppino
poor
miss
bracely
she
said
it
was
very
kind
of
her
in
intention
to
ask
me
but
she
would
have
been
kinder
to
have
asked
mrs
antrobus
instead
and
have
told
her
not
to
bring
her
to
hear
that
lovely
voice
for
i
do
her
justice
and
there
are
lovely
notes
in
her
voice
to
hear
that
voice
shrieking
and
screaming
away
in
what
she
called
the
great
scene
was
simply
pitiful
there
was
no
melody
and
above
all
there
was
no
form
a
musical
composition
is
like
an
architectural
building
it
must
be
built
up
and
constructed
how
often
have
i
said
that
you
must
have
colour
and
you
must
have
line
otherwise
i
can
not
concede
you
the
right
to
say
you
have
music
lucia
finished
her
egg
in
a
hurry
and
put
her
elbows
on
the
table
i
hope
i
am
not
and
limited
she
said
and
i
think
you
will
acknowledge
georgie
that
i
am
not
even
in
the
divinest
music
of
all
i
am
not
blind
to
defects
if
there
are
defects
the
moonlight
sonata
for
instance
you
have
often
heard
me
say
that
the
two
last
movements
do
not
approach
the
first
in
perfection
of
form
and
if
i
am
permitted
to
criticise
beethoven
i
hope
i
may
be
allowed
to
suggest
that
mr
cortese
has
not
produced
an
opera
which
will
render
fidelio
ridiculous
but
really
i
am
chiefly
sorry
for
miss
bracely
i
should
have
thought
it
worth
her
while
to
render
herself
not
unworthy
to
interpret
fidelio
whatever
time
and
trouble
that
cost
her
rather
than
to
seek
notoriety
by
helping
to
foist
on
to
the
world
a
fresh
combination
of
and
grunts
e
peppino
how
late
you
are
lucia
had
not
determined
on
this
declaration
of
war
without
anxious
consideration
but
it
was
quite
obvious
to
her
that
the
enemy
was
daily
gaining
strength
and
therefore
the
sooner
she
came
to
open
hostilities
the
better
for
it
was
equally
obvious
to
her
mind
that
olga
was
a
pretender
to
the
throne
she
had
occupied
for
so
long
it
was
time
to
mobilise
and
she
had
first
to
state
her
views
and
her
plan
of
campaign
to
the
chief
of
her
staff
no
we
did
not
quite
like
our
evening
peppino
and
i
did
we
she
went
on
and
mr
cortese
his
appearance
he
is
like
a
huge
hairdresser
his
touch
on
the
piano
if
you
can
imagine
a
wild
bull
butting
at
the
keys
you
will
have
some
idea
of
it
and
above
all
his
italian
i
gathered
that
he
was
a
neapolitan
and
we
all
know
what
neapolitan
dialect
is
like
tuscans
and
romans
who
between
them
i
believe
lingua
toscano
in
bocca
romana
you
remember
know
how
to
speak
their
own
tongue
find
neapolitans
totally
unintelligible
for
myself
and
i
speak
for
mio
sposo
as
well
i
do
not
want
to
understand
what
romans
do
not
understand
la
bella
lingua
is
sufficient
for
me
i
hear
that
olga
could
understand
him
quite
well
said
georgie
betraying
his
complete
knowledge
of
all
that
had
happened
that
may
be
so
said
lucia
i
hope
she
understood
his
english
too
and
his
music
he
had
not
an
when
he
spoke
english
and
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
his
italian
was
equally
illiterate
it
does
not
matter
i
do
not
see
that
mr
linguistic
accomplishments
concern
us
but
his
music
does
if
poor
miss
bracely
with
her
lovely
notes
is
going
to
study
it
and
appear
as
lucretia
i
am
sorry
if
that
is
so
any
news
really
it
was
rather
magnificent
and
it
was
war
as
well
of
that
there
could
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
all
riseholme
by
this
time
knew
that
lucia
and
peppino
had
not
been
able
to
understand
a
word
of
what
cortese
had
said
and
here
was
the
answer
to
the
suggestion
vividly
put
forward
by
mrs
weston
on
the
green
that
morning
that
the
explanation
was
that
lucia
and
peppino
did
not
know
italian
they
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
neapolitan
dialect
the
language
of
dante
satisfied
their
humble
needs
they
found
it
difficult
to
understand
cortese
when
he
spoke
english
but
that
did
not
imply
that
they
did
not
know
english
dante
tongue
and
shakespeare
tongue
sufficed
them
and
what
were
the
words
of
the
libretto
like
asked
georgie
lucia
fixed
him
with
her
beady
eyes
ready
and
eager
to
show
how
delighted
she
was
to
bestow
approbation
wherever
it
was
deserved
wonderful
she
said
i
felt
and
so
did
peppino
that
the
words
were
as
utterly
wasted
on
that
formless
music
as
was
poor
miss
voice
how
did
it
go
peppino
let
me
think
lucia
raised
her
head
again
with
the
look
amore
misterio
she
said
amore
profondo
amore
profondo
del
vasto
mar
ah
there
was
our
poor
bella
lingua
again
i
wonder
who
wrote
the
libretto
mr
cortese
wrote
the
libretto
said
georgie
lucia
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
but
gave
her
silvery
laugh
oh
dear
me
no
she
said
if
you
had
heard
him
talk
you
would
know
he
could
not
have
well
have
we
not
had
enough
of
mr
cortese
and
his
works
any
news
what
did
you
do
last
night
when
peppino
and
i
were
in
our
purgatorio
georgie
was
almost
equally
glad
to
get
off
the
subject
of
italian
the
less
said
in
or
of
italian
the
better
i
was
dining
with
mrs
quantock
he
said
she
had
a
very
interesting
russian
woman
staying
with
her
princess
popoffski
lucia
laughed
again
dear
daisy
she
said
tell
me
about
the
russian
princess
was
she
a
guru
dear
me
how
easily
some
people
are
taken
in
the
guru
well
we
were
all
in
the
same
boat
there
we
took
the
guru
on
poor
valuation
and
i
still
believe
he
had
very
remarkable
gifts
or
not
but
princess
popoffski
now
we
had
a
seance
said
georgie
indeed
and
princess
popoffski
was
the
medium
georgie
grew
a
little
dignified
it
is
no
use
adopting
that
tone
cara
he
said
relapsing
into
italian
you
were
not
there
you
were
having
your
purgatory
at
olga
it
was
very
remarkable
we
touched
hands
all
round
the
table
there
was
no
possibility
of
fraud
lucia
views
on
psychic
phenomena
were
clearly
known
to
riseholme
those
who
produced
them
were
fraudulent
those
who
were
taken
in
by
them
were
dupes
consequently
there
was
irony
in
the
of
her
reply
me
dood
she
said
me
very
dood
and
listen
carefully
tell
lucia
georgie
recounted
the
experiences
the
table
had
rocked
and
tapped
out
names
the
table
had
whirled
round
though
it
was
a
very
heavy
table
georgie
had
been
told
that
he
had
two
sisters
one
of
whom
in
latin
was
a
bear
how
did
the
table
know
that
he
asked
ursa
a
bear
you
know
and
then
while
we
were
sitting
there
the
princess
went
off
into
a
trance
she
said
there
was
a
beautiful
spirit
present
who
blessed
us
all
she
called
mrs
quantock
margarita
which
as
you
may
know
is
the
italian
for
daisy
lucia
smiled
thank
you
for
explaining
georgino
she
said
there
was
no
mistaking
the
irony
of
that
and
georgie
thought
he
would
be
ironical
too
i
did
know
if
you
knew
he
said
i
thought
it
might
be
neapolitan
dialect
pray
go
on
said
lucia
breathing
through
her
nose
and
she
said
i
was
georgie
said
georgie
but
that
there
was
another
georgie
not
far
off
that
was
odd
because
olga
house
with
mr
shuttleworth
were
so
close
and
then
the
princess
went
into
very
deep
trance
and
the
spirit
that
was
there
took
possession
of
her
and
who
was
that
asked
lucia
his
name
was
amadeo
she
spoke
in
amadeo
voice
indeed
it
was
amadeo
who
was
speaking
he
was
a
florentine
and
knew
dante
quite
well
he
materialised
i
saw
him
a
bright
glorious
vision
flashed
upon
lucia
the
might
not
even
though
it
was
clearly
understood
that
cortese
spoke
unintelligible
neapolitan
be
a
complete
success
if
the
only
attraction
was
that
she
herself
taught
dante
but
it
would
be
quite
a
different
proposition
if
princess
popoffski
controlled
by
amadeo
dante
friend
was
present
they
might
read
a
canto
first
and
then
hold
a
seance
of
which
amadeo
via
princess
popoffski
would
take
charge
while
this
was
simmering
in
her
mind
it
was
important
to
drop
all
irony
and
be
extremely
sympathetic
georgino
how
wonderful
she
said
as
you
know
i
am
sceptical
by
nature
and
want
all
evidence
carefully
sifted
i
daresay
i
am
too
critical
and
that
is
a
fault
but
fancy
getting
in
touch
with
a
friend
of
dante
what
would
one
not
give
tell
me
what
is
this
princess
like
is
she
the
sort
of
person
one
could
ask
to
dinner
georgie
was
still
sore
over
the
irony
to
which
he
had
been
treated
he
had
moreover
the
solid
fact
behind
him
that
daisy
quantock
margarita
had
declared
that
in
no
circumstances
would
she
permit
lucia
to
annex
her
princess
she
had
forgiven
lucia
for
annexing
the
guru
and
considering
that
she
had
only
annexed
a
it
was
not
so
difficult
but
she
was
quite
determined
to
run
her
princess
herself
yes
you
might
ask
her
he
said
if
irony
was
going
about
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
have
a
share
lucia
bounced
from
her
seat
as
if
it
had
been
a
spring
cushion
we
will
have
a
little
party
she
said
we
three
and
dear
daisy
and
her
husband
and
the
princess
i
think
that
will
be
enough
psychics
hate
a
crowd
because
it
disturbs
the
influences
mind
i
do
not
say
i
believe
in
her
power
yet
but
i
am
quite
i
should
like
to
be
convinced
let
me
see
we
are
doing
nothing
tomorrow
let
us
have
our
little
dinner
tomorrow
i
will
send
a
line
to
dear
daisy
at
once
and
say
how
enormously
your
account
of
the
seance
has
interested
me
i
should
like
dear
daisy
to
have
something
to
console
her
for
that
terrible
fiasco
about
her
guru
and
then
georgino
mio
i
will
listen
to
your
debussy
do
not
expect
anything
if
it
seems
to
me
formless
i
shall
say
so
but
if
it
seems
to
me
promising
i
shall
be
equally
frank
perhaps
it
is
great
i
can
not
tell
you
about
that
till
i
have
heard
it
let
me
write
my
note
first
that
was
soon
done
and
lucia
having
sent
it
by
hand
came
into
the
and
drew
down
the
blinds
over
the
window
through
which
the
autumn
sun
was
streaming
very
little
art
as
she
had
once
said
would
stand
daylight
only
shakespeare
or
dante
or
beethoven
and
perhaps
bach
could
compete
with
the
sun
georgie
for
his
part
would
have
liked
rather
more
light
but
after
all
debussy
wrote
such
very
odd
chords
and
sequences
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
wear
his
spectacles
lucia
sat
in
a
high
chair
near
the
piano
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
tremendously
erect
georgie
took
off
his
rings
and
laid
them
on
the
and
ran
his
hands
nimbly
over
the
piano
he
said

lucia
explaining
it
to
peppino
lucia
face
changed
as
the
elusive
music
proceeded
the
look
died
away
and
became
puzzled
her
chin
came
out
of
her
hand
and
the
hand
it
came
out
of
covered
her
eyes
before
georgie
had
got
to
the
end
the
answer
to
her
note
came
and
she
sat
with
it
in
her
hand
which
released
from
covering
her
eyes
tried
to
beat
time
on
the
last
note
she
got
up
with
a
regretful
sigh
is
it
finished
she
asked
and
yet
i
feel
inclined
to
say
is
it
going
to
begin
i

been
fed

drank
in
anything

pulled
up

again
in

to
read

note
and
as
she
read
her
face
clouded
ah

sorry

chapter
thirteen
spiritualism
and
all
things
pertaining
to
it
swept
over
riseholme
like
the
amazing
growth
of
some
tropical
forest
germinating
and
shooting
out
its
surprising
vegetation
and
rearing
into
huge
fantastic
shapes
in
the
centre
of
this
wonderful
jungle
was
a
temple
so
to
speak
and
that
temple
was
the
house
of
mrs
quantock
a
strange
providence
was
the
origin
of
it
all
mrs
quantock
a
week
before
had
the
toothache
and
being
no
longer
in
the
fold
of
christian
science
found
that
it
was
no
good
at
all
to
tell
herself
that
it
was
a
false
claim
false
claim
it
might
be
but
it
was
so
plausible
at
once
that
it
quite
deceived
her
and
she
went
up
to
london
to
have
its
falsity
demonstrated
by
a
dentist
since
the
collapse
of
yoga
and
the
flight
of
the
she
had
embarked
on
no
mystical
adventure
and
she
starved
for
some
new
fad
then
when
her
first
visit
to
the
dentist
was
over
the
tooth
required
three
treatments
and
she
went
to
a
vegetarian
restaurant
to
see
if
there
was
anything
enlightening
to
be
got
out
of
that
she
was
delighted
to
find
herself
sitting
at
a
very
small
table
with
a
very
communicative
lady
who
ate
cabbages
in
perfectly
incredible
quantities
she
had
a
round
pale
face
like
the
moon
behind
the
clouds
enormous
eyebrows
that
almost
met
over
her
nose
and
a
strange
low
voice
of
husky
tone
and
a
pronunciation
quite
as
foreign
as
signor
cortese
she
wore
some
very
curious
rings
with
large
engraved
amethysts
and
turquoises
in
them
and
since
in
the
first
moments
of
their
conversation
she
had
volunteered
the
information
that
vegetarianism
was
the
only
possible
diet
for
any
who
were
cultivating
their
psychical
powers
mrs
quantock
asked
her
if
these
weird
had
any
mystical
signification
they
had
one
was
gnostic
one
was
rosicrucian
and
the
other
was
cabalistic
it
is
easy
to
picture
mrs
quantock
delight
adventure
had
met
her
with
smiling
mouth
and
mysterious
eyes
in
the
course
of
an
animated
conversation
of
half
an
hour
the
lady
explained
that
if
mrs
quantock
was
like
her
a
searcher
after
psychical
truths
and
cared
to
come
to
her
flat
at
four
that
afternoon
she
would
try
to
help
her
she
added
with
some
little
diffidence
that
the
fee
for
a
seance
was
a
guinea
and
as
she
left
took
a
card
out
of
a
case
encrusted
with
glowing
rubies
and
gave
it
her
that
was
the
princess
popoffski
now
here
was
a
curious
thing
for
the
last
few
evenings
at
riseholme
mrs
quantock
had
been
experimenting
with
a
table
and
found
that
it
creaked
and
tilted
and
tapped
in
the
most
encouraging
way
when
she
and
robert
laid
their
hands
on
it
then
something
whatever
it
was
that
moved
the
table
had
indicated
by
raps
that
her
name
was
daisy
and
his
robert
as
well
as
giving
them
other
information
which
could
not
so
easily
be
verified
robert
had
grown
quite
excited
about
it
and
was
vexed
that
the
seances
were
interrupted
by
his
wife
expedition
to
london
but
now
how
providential
that
was
she
had
walked
straight
from
the
dentist
into
the
arms
of
princess
popoffski
it
was
barely
four
when
mrs
quantock
arrived
at
the
princess
flat
in
a
pleasant
quiet
side
street
off
charing
cross
road
a
small
dapper
little
gentleman
received
her
who
explained
that
he
was
the
princess
secretary
and
conducted
her
through
several
small
rooms
into
the
presence
of
the
sybil
these
rooms
so
mrs
quantock
thrillingly
noticed
were
dimly
lit
by
oil
lamps
that
stood
in
front
of
shrines
containing
images
of
the
great
spiritual
guides
from
moses
down
to
madame
blavatski
a
smell
of
incense
hung
about
there
were
vases
of
flowers
on
the
tables
and
strange
caskets
set
with
winking
stones
in
the
last
of
these
rooms
the
princess
was
seated
and
for
the
moment
mrs
quantock
hardly
recognised
her
for
she
wore
a
blue
robe
which
left
her
massive
arms
bare
and
up
them
writhed
bracelets
of
many
coils
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
mrs
quantock
as
if
she
had
never
seen
her
before
and
made
no
sign
of
recognition
the
princess
has
been
meditating
said
the
secretary
in
a
whisper
she
come
to
herself
presently
for
a
moment
meditation
unpleasantly
reminded
mrs
quantock
of
the
guru
but
nothing
could
have
been
less
like
that
than
this
majestic
creature
eventually
she
gave
a
great
sigh
and
came
out
of
her
meditation
ah
it
is
my
friend
she
said
do
you
know
that
you
have
a
purple
halo
this
was
very
gratifying
especially
when
it
was
explained
that
only
the
most
elect
had
purple
halos
and
soon
other
elect
souls
assembled
for
the
seance
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
placed
a
musical
box
and
a
violin
and
hardly
had
the
circle
been
made
and
the
lights
turned
down
when
the
most
extraordinary
things
began
to
happen
a
perfect
storm
of
rappings
issued
from
the
table
which
began
to
rock
violently
and
presently
there
came
peals
of
laughter
in
a
high
voice
and
those
who
had
been
here
before
said
that
it
was
pocky
he
was
a
dear
naughty
boy
so
mrs
quantock
neighbour
explained
to
her
so
full
of
fun
and
when
on
earth
had
been
a
hungarian
violinist
still
invisible
pocky
wished
them
all
much
laughter
and
joy
and
then
suddenly
said
a
new
friend
i
like
her
and
mrs
quantock
neighbour
with
a
touch
of
envy
in
her
voice
told
her
that
pocky
clearly
meant
her
then
pocky
said
that
they
had
been
having
heavenly
music
on
the
other
side
that
day
and
that
if
the
new
friend
would
say
please
he
would
play
them
some
of
it
so
mrs
quantock
trembling
with
emotion
said
please
pocky
and
instantly
he
began
to
play
on
the
violin
the
spirit
tune
which
he
had
just
been
playing
on
the
other
side
after
that
the
violin
clattered
back
onto
the
middle
of
the
table
again
and
pocky
blowing
showers
of
kisses
to
them
all
went
away
amid
peals
of
happy
laughter
silence
fell
and
then
a
deep
bass
voice
said
i
am
coming
amadeo
and
out
of
the
middle
of
the
table
appeared
a
faint
luminousness
it
grew
upwards
and
began
to
take
form
swathes
of
white
muslin
shaped
themselves
in
the
darkness
and
there
appeared
a
white
face
in
among
the
topmost
folds
of
the
muslin
with
a
roman
nose
and
a
melancholy
expression
he
was
not
gay
like
pocky
but
he
was
intensely
impressive
and
spoke
some
lines
in
italian
when
asked
to
repeat
a
piece
of
dante
mrs
quantock
knew
they
were
italian
because
she
recognised
notte
and
uno
and
caro
familiar
words
on
lucia
lips
the
seance
came
to
an
end
and
mrs
quantock
having
placed
a
guinea
with
the
utmost
alacrity
in
a
sort
of
offertory
plate
which
the
secretary
negligently
but
prominently
put
down
on
a
table
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
waited
to
arrange
for
another
seance
but
most
unfortunately
the
princess
was
leaving
town
next
day
on
a
much
needed
holiday
for
she
had
been
giving
three
seances
a
day
for
the
last
two
months
and
required
rest
yes
we
off
tomorrow
the
princess
and
i
said
he
for
a
week
at
the
royal
hotel
at
brinton
pleasant
bracing
air
always
sets
her
up
but
after
that
she
be
back
in
town
do
you
know
that
part
of
the
country
daisy
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
brinton
she
said
i
live
close
to
brinton
her
whole
scheme
flashed
completely
upon
her
even
as
athene
sprang
from
the
brain
of
zeus
do
you
think
that
she
might
be
induced
to
spend
a
few
days
with
me
at
riseholme
she
said
my
husband
and
i
are
so
much
interested
in
psychical
things
you
would
be
our
guest
too
i
hope
if
she
rested
for
a
few
days
at
brinton
first
if
she
came
on
to
me
afterwards
and
then
if
she
was
thoroughly
rested
perhaps
she
would
give
us
a
seance
or
two
i
do
know
mrs
quantock
felt
a
great
diffidence
in
speaking
of
guineas
in
the
same
sentence
with
princesses
and
had
to
make
another
start
if
she
were
thoroughly
rested
she
said
and
if
a
little
circle
perhaps
of
four
at
the
usual
price
would
be
worth
her
while
just
after
dinner
you
know
and
nothing
else
to
do
all
day
but
rest
there
are
pretty
drives
and
beautiful
air
all
very
quiet
and
i
think
i
may
say
more
comfortable
than
the
hotel
it
would
be
such
a
pleasure
mrs
quantock
heard
the
clinking
of
bracelets
from
the
room
where
the
princess
was
still
reposing
and
there
she
stood
in
the
door
looking
unspeakably
majestic
but
very
gracious
so
mrs
quantock
put
her
proposition
before
her
the
secretary
coming
to
the
rescue
on
the
subject
of
the
usual
fees
and
when
two
days
afterwards
mrs
quantock
returned
to
riseholme
it
was
to
get
ready
the
spare
room
and
room
next
to
it
for
these
thrilling
visitors
whose
first
seance
georgie
and
piggy
had
attended
on
the
evening
of
the
italian
debacle
the
quantocks
had
taken
a
high
and
magnificent
line
about
the
usual
fees
for
the
seances
an
expensive
line
but
then
roumanian
oils
had
been
extremely
prosperous
lately
no
mention
whatever
of
these
fees
was
made
to
their
guests
no
was
put
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
hall
there
was
no
fumbling
for
change
or
the
discreet
pressure
of
coins
into
the
secretary
hand
the
entire
cost
was
borne
by
roumanian
oils
the
princess
and
mrs
quantock
apparently
were
old
friends
they
spoke
to
each
other
at
dinner
as
dear
friend
and
the
princess
declared
in
the
most
gratifying
way
that
they
had
been
most
intimate
in
a
previous
incarnation
without
any
allusion
to
the
fact
that
in
this
incarnation
they
had
met
for
the
first
time
last
week
at
a
vegetarian
restaurant
she
was
kind
enough
it
was
left
to
be
understood
to
give
a
little
seance
after
dinner
at
the
house
of
her
dear
friend
and
so
publicly
the
question
of
money
never
came
up
now
the
princess
was
to
stay
three
nights
and
therefore
as
soon
as
mrs
quantock
had
made
sure
of
that
she
proceeded
to
fill
up
each
of
the
seances
without
asking
lucia
to
any
of
them
it
was
not
that
she
had
not
fully
forgiven
her
for
her
odious
grabbing
of
the
guru
for
she
had
done
that
on
the
night
of
the
spanish
quartette
it
was
rather
that
she
meant
to
make
sure
that
there
would
by
no
possibility
be
anything
to
forgive
concerning
her
conduct
with
regard
to
the
princess
lucia
could
not
grab
her
and
so
call
daisy
powers
of
forgiveness
into
play
again
if
she
never
came
near
her
and
daisy
meant
to
take
proper
precautions
that
she
should
not
come
near
her
accordingly
georgie
and
piggy
were
asked
to
the
first
seance
if
it
did
not
go
very
well
it
would
not
particularly
matter
with
them
olga
and
mr
shuttleworth
were
bidden
to
the
second
and
lady
ambermere
with
georgie
again
to
the
third
this
quite
apart
from
the
immense
interest
of
psychic
phenomena
was
deadly
work
for
it
would
be
bitter
indeed
to
lucia
to
know
as
she
most
undoubtedly
would
that
lady
ambermere
who
had
cut
her
so
firmly
was
dining
twice
and
coming
to
a
seance
daisy
it
must
again
be
repeated
had
quite
forgiven
lucia
about
the
guru
but
lucia
must
take
the
consequences
of
what
she
had
done
it
was
after
the
first
seance
that
the
frenzy
for
spiritualism
seized
riseholme
the
princess
with
great
gave
some
further
exhibitions
of
her
psychical
power
in
addition
to
the
seances
and
even
as
georgie
the
next
afternoon
was
receiving
lucia
cruel
verdict
about
debussy
the
sybil
was
looking
at
the
hands
of
colonel
boucher
and
mrs
weston
and
unerringly
probing
into
their
past
and
lifting
the
corner
of
the
veil
giving
them
both
glimpses
into
the
future
she
knew
that
the
two
were
engaged
for
that
she
had
learned
from
mrs
quantock
in
her
morning
drive
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
but
how
could
it
be
accounted
for
that
looking
impressively
from
the
one
to
the
other
she
said
that
a
woman
no
longer
young
but
tall
and
with
fair
hair
had
crossed
their
lives
and
had
been
connected
with
one
of
them
for
years
past
it
was
impossible
to
describe
elizabeth
more
accurately
than
that
and
mrs
weston
in
high
excitement
confessed
that
her
maid
who
had
been
with
her
for
fifteen
years
entirely
corresponded
with
what
the
princess
had
seen
in
her
hand
after
that
it
took
only
a
further
scrutiny
for
the
princess
to
discover
that
elizabeth
was
going
to
be
happy
too
then
she
found
that
there
was
a
man
connected
with
elizabeth
and
colonel
boucher
hand
to
which
she
transferred
her
gaze
trembled
with
delightful
anticipation
she
seemed
to
see
a
man
there
she
was
not
quite
sure
but
was
there
a
man
who
perhaps
had
been
known
to
him
for
a
long
time
there
was
and
then
by
degrees
the
affairs
of
elizabeth
and
atkinson
were
unerringly
unravelled
it
was
little
wonder
that
the
colonel
pushed
mrs
weston
with
record
speed
to
ye
signe
of
ye
daffodil
and
by
the
greatest
good
luck
obtained
a
copy
of
the
palmist
manual
at
another
of
these
informal
seances
attended
by
goosie
and
mrs
antrobus
even
stranger
things
had
happened
for
the
princess
hands
as
they
held
a
little
preliminary
conversation
began
to
tremble
and
twitch
even
more
strongly
than
colonel
boucher
and
mrs
quantock
hastily
supplied
her
with
a
pencil
and
a
quantity
of
sheets
of
foolscap
paper
for
this
trembling
and
twitching
implied
that
reschia
an
ancient
egyptian
priestess
was
longing
to
use
the
princess
hand
for
automatic
writing
after
a
few
wild
scrawls
and
plunges
with
the
pencil
the
princess
though
she
still
continued
to
talk
to
them
covered
sheet
after
sheet
in
large
flowing
handwriting
this
when
it
was
finished
and
the
princess
sunk
back
in
her
chair
proved
to
be
the
most
wonderful
spiritual
discourse
describing
the
happiness
and
harmony
which
pervaded
the
whole
universe
and
was
only
temporarily
obscured
by
the
mists
of
materiality
these
mists
were
wholly
withdrawn
from
the
vision
of
those
who
had
passed
over
they
lived
in
the
midst
of
song
and
flowers
and
light
and
love
towards
the
end
there
was
a
less
intelligible
passage
about
fire
from
the
clouds
it
was
rendered
completely
intelligible
the
very
next
day
when
there
was
a
thunderstorm
surely
an
unusual
occurrence
in
november
if
that
had
not
happened
mrs
quantock
interpretation
of
it
as
referring
to
zeppelins
would
have
been
found
equally
satisfactory
it
was
no
wonder
after
that
that
mrs
antrobus
piggy
and
goosie
spent
long
evenings
with
pencils
and
paper
for
the
princess
said
that
everybody
had
the
gift
of
automatic
writing
if
they
would
only
take
pains
and
patience
to
develop
it
everybody
had
his
own
particular
guide
and
it
was
the
very
next
day
that
piggy
obtained
a
script
clearly
signed
annabel
nicostratus
and
jamifleg
followed
very
soon
after
for
her
mother
and
sister
and
so
there
was
no
jealousy
but
the
crown
and
apex
of
these
manifestations
was
undoubtedly
the
three
regular
seances
which
took
place
to
the
three
select
circles
after
dinner
musical
boxes
resounded
violins
gave
forth
ravishing
airs
the
sitters
were
touched
by
unseen
fingers
when
everybody
hands
were
touching
all
around
the
table
and
from
the
middle
of
it
materialisations
swathed
in
muslin
were
built
up
pocky
came
visible
to
the
eye
and
played
spirit
music
amadeo
melancholy
and
impressive
recited
dante
and
cardinal
newman
not
visible
to
the
eye
but
audible
to
the
ear
joined
in
the
singing
lead
kindly
light
which
the
secretary
requested
them
to
encourage
him
with
and
blessed
them
profusely
at
the
conclusion
lady
ambermere
was
so
much
impressed
and
so
nervous
of
driving
home
alone
that
she
insisted
on
georgie
going
back
to
the
hall
with
her
and
consigning
her
person
to
pug
and
miss
lyall
and
for
the
three
days
of
the
princess
visit
there
was
practically
no
subject
discussed
at
the
parliaments
on
the
green
except
the
latest
manifestations
olga
went
to
town
for
a
crystal
and
georgie
for
a
planchette
and
riseholme
temporarily
became
a
spiritualistic
republic
with
the
princess
as
priestess
and
mrs
quantock
as
president
lucia
all
this
time
was
almost
insane
with
pique
and
jealousy
for
she
sat
in
vain
waiting
for
an
invitation
to
come
to
a
seance
and
would
long
before
the
three
days
were
over
have
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
a
place
at
one
of
the
inferior
and
informal
exhibitions
since
she
could
not
procure
the
princess
for
dinner
she
asked
daisy
to
bring
her
to
lunch
or
tea
or
at
any
hour
day
or
night
which
was
convenient
she
made
peppino
hang
about
opposite
daisy
house
with
orders
to
drop
his
stick
or
let
his
hat
blow
off
if
he
saw
even
the
secretary
coming
out
of
the
gate
so
as
possibly
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
while
she
positively
forced
herself
one
morning
into
daisy
hall
and
cried
margarita
in
silvery
tones
on
this
occasion
margarita
came
out
of
the
with
a
most
determined
expression
on
her
face
and
shut
the
door
carefully
behind
her
dearest
lucia
she
said
how
nice
to
see
you
what
is
it
i
just
popped
in
for
a
chat
said
she
i
have
set
eyes
on
you
since
the
evening
of
the
spanish
quartette
no
so
long
ago
as
that
is
it
well
you
must
come
in
again
sometime
very
soon
wo
you
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
shall
be
much
less
busy
promise
to
look
in
then
you
have
a
visitor
with
you
have
you
not
asked
lucia
desperately
yes
two
indeed
dear
friends
of
mine
but
i
am
afraid
you
would
not
like
them
i
know
your
opinion
about
anything
connected
with
spiritualism
and
is
it
silly
of
us
we
been
dabbling
in
that
oh
but
how
interesting
said
lucia
i
i
am
always
ready
to
learn
and
alter
my
opinions
if
i
am
wrong
mrs
quantock
did
not
move
from
in
front
of
the
door
yes
she
said
then
we
will
have
a
great
talk
about
it
when
you
come
to
see
me
the
day
after
tomorrow
but
i
know
i
shall
find
you
hard
to
convince
she
kissed
the
tips
of
her
fingers
in
a
manner
so
hopelessly
final
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
away
then
with
poor
generalship
lucia
altered
her
tactics
and
went
up
to
the
village
green
where
piggy
was
telling
georgie
about
the
script
signed
annabel
this
was
repeated
again
for
lucia
benefit
was
it
too
lovely
said
piggy
so
annabel
my
guide
and
she
writes
a
hand
quite
unlike
mine
lucia
gave
a
little
scream
and
put
her
fingers
to
her
ears
gracious
me
she
said
what
has
come
over
riseholme
wherever
i
go
i
hear
nothing
but
talk
of
seances
and
spirits
and
automatic
writing
such
a
pack
of
nonsense
my
dear
piggy
i
wonder
at
a
sensible
girl
like
you
mrs
weston
propelled
by
the
colonel
whirled
up
in
her
palmist
manual
is
too
wonderful
she
said
and
jacob
and
i
sat
up
over
it
till
i
do
know
what
hour
there
a
break
in
his
line
of
life
just
at
the
right
place
when
he
was
so
ill
in
egypt
which
is
most
remarkable
and
when
tommy
luton
brought
round
my
this
morning
i
had
it
at
the
because
the
gravel
just
laid
at
my
and
the
wheels
sink
so
far
into
it
i
said
me
look
at
your
hand
a
moment
and
there
on
his
line
of
fate
was
the
little
cross
that
means
bereavement
it
came
just
right
did
it
jacob
when
he
was
thirteen
for
he
fourteen
this
year
and
mrs
luton
died
just
a
year
ago
of
course
i
did
tell
tommy
that
for
i
only
told
him
to
wash
his
hands
but
it
was
most
curious
and
has
your
planchette
come
yet
mr
georgie
i
shall
be
most
anxious
to
know
what
it
writes
so
if
you
got
an
evening
free
any
night
soon
just
come
round
for
a
bit
of
dinner
and
we
make
an
evening
of
it
with
table
turning
and
planchette
and
palmistry
now
tell
me
all
about
the
seance
the
first
night
i
wish
i
could
have
been
present
at
a
real
seance
but
of
course
mrs
quantock
ca
find
room
for
everybody
and
i
sure
it
was
most
kind
of
her
to
let
the
colonel
and
me
come
in
yesterday
afternoon
we
were
thrilled
with
it
and
who
knows
but
that
the
princess
did
write
the
palmist
manual
for
on
the
title
page
it
says
it
by
and
that
might
be
popoffski
as
easily
as
not
or
perhaps
princess
this
allusion
to
there
not
being
room
for
everybody
was
agony
to
lucia
she
laughed
in
her
most
silvery
manner
or
perhaps
peppino
she
said
i
must
ask
if
he
wrote
it
or
does
it
stand
for
pillson
georgino
are
you
the
author
of
the
palmist
manual
ecco
i
believe
it
was
you
this
was
not
quite
wise
for
no
one
detested
irony
more
than
mrs
weston
or
was
sharper
to
detect
it
lucia
should
never
have
been
ironical
just
then
nor
indeed
have
dropped
into
italian
no
she
said
i
sure
it
was
neither
il
signer
peppino
nor
il
signer
pillson
who
wrote
it
i
believe
it
was
the
principessa
so
ecco
and
did
we
not
have
a
delicious
evening
at
miss
bracely
the
other
night
such
lovely
singing
and
so
interesting
to
learn
that
signor
cortese
made
it
all
up
and
those
lovely
words
for
though
i
did
understand
much
of
them
they
sounded
so
exquisite
and
fancy
miss
bracely
talking
italian
so
beautifully
when
we
none
of
us
knew
she
talked
it
at
all
mrs
weston
amiable
face
was
crimson
with
suppressed
emotion
of
which
these
few
words
were
only
the
most
insignificant
leakage
and
a
very
awkward
pause
succeeded
which
was
luckily
broken
by
everybody
beginning
to
talk
again
very
fast
and
brightly
then
mrs
weston
chair
scudded
away
piggy
skipped
away
to
the
stocks
where
goosie
was
sitting
with
a
large
sheet
of
foolscap
in
case
her
hand
twitched
for
automatic
script
and
lucia
turned
to
georgie
who
alone
was
left
poor
daisy
she
said
i
dropped
in
just
now
and
really
i
found
her
very
odd
and
strange
what
with
her
crazes
for
christian
science
and
uric
acid
and
gurus
and
mediums
one
wonders
if
she
is
quite
sane
so
sad
i
should
be
dreadfully
sorry
if
she
had
some
mental
collapse
that
sort
of
thing
is
always
so
painful
but
i
know
of
a
place
for
i
think
it
would
be
wise
if
i
just
casually
dropped
the
name
of
it
to
mr
robert
in
case
and
this
last
craze
seems
so
terribly
infectious
fancy
mrs
weston
dabbling
in
palmistry
it
is
too
comical
but
i
hope
i
did
not
hurt
her
feelings
by
suggesting
that
peppino
or
you
wrote
the
manual
it
is
dangerous
to
make
little
jokes
to
poor
mrs
weston
georgie
quite
agreed
with
that
but
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
say
in
what
sense
he
agreed
with
it
every
day
now
lucia
was
pouring
floods
of
light
on
a
quite
new
side
of
her
character
which
had
been
undeveloped
like
the
print
from
some
photographic
plate
lying
in
the
dark
so
long
as
she
was
undisputed
mistress
of
riseholme
but
so
it
struck
him
now
since
the
advent
of
olga
she
had
taken
up
a
critical
ironical
standpoint
which
previously
she
had
reserved
for
londoners
at
every
turn
she
had
to
criticise
and
condemn
where
once
she
would
only
have
praised
so
few
months
ago
there
had
been
that
marvellous
hightum
garden
party
when
olga
had
sung
long
after
lady
ambermere
had
gone
away
that
was
her
garden
party
the
splendour
and
success
of
it
had
been
hers
and
no
one
had
been
allowed
to
forget
that
until
olga
came
back
again
but
the
moment
that
happened
and
olga
began
to
sing
on
her
own
account
which
after
all
so
georgie
thought
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
the
whole
aspect
of
affairs
was
changed
she
romped
and
riseholme
did
not
like
romps
she
sang
in
church
and
that
was
theatrical
she
gave
a
party
with
the
spanish
quartette
and
brinton
was
publicly
credited
with
the
performance
then
had
come
mrs
quantock
and
her
princess
and
lo
it
would
be
kind
to
remember
the
name
of
an
establishment
for
in
the
hope
of
saving
poor
daisy
sanity
again
colonel
boucher
and
mrs
weston
were
intending
to
get
married
and
consulted
a
palmist
manual
so
they
too
helped
to
develop
as
with
acid
the
print
that
had
lain
so
long
in
the
dark
poor
thing
said
lucia
it
is
dreadful
to
have
no
sense
of
humour
and
i
sure
i
hope
that
colonel
boucher
will
thoroughly
understand
that
she
has
none
before
he
speaks
the
fatal
words
but
then
he
has
none
either
and
i
have
often
noticed
that
two
people
without
any
sense
of
humour
find
each
other
most
witty
and
amusing
a
sense
of
humour
i
expect
is
not
a
very
common
gift
miss
bracely
has
none
at
all
for
i
do
not
call
romping
humour
as
for
poor
daisy
what
can
rival
her
solemnity
in
sitting
night
after
night
round
a
table
with
someone
who
may
or
may
not
be
a
russian
princess
russia
of
course
is
a
very
large
place
and
one
does
not
know
how
many
princesses
there
may
be
there
and
thrilling
over
a
pot
of
luminous
paint
and
a
false
nose
and
calling
it
amadeo
the
friend
of
dante
this
was
too
much
for
georgie
but
you
asked
mrs
quantock
and
the
princess
to
dine
with
you
he
said
and
hoped
there
would
be
a
seance
afterwards
you
would
have
done
that
if
you
thought
it
was
only
a
false
nose
and
a
pot
of
luminous
paint
i
may
have
been
impulsive
said
lucia
speaking
very
rapidly
i
daresay
i
impulsive
and
if
my
impulses
lie
in
the
direction
of
extending
such
poor
hospitality
as
i
can
offer
to
my
friends
and
their
friends
i
am
not
ashamed
of
them
far
otherwise
but
when
i
see
and
observe
the
awful
effect
of
this
spiritualism
on
people
whom
i
should
have
thought
sensible
and
i
do
not
include
poor
dear
daisy
among
them
then
i
am
only
thankful
that
my
impulses
did
not
happen
to
lead
me
into
countenancing
such
piffle
as
your
sister
so
truly
observed
about
poor
daisy
guru
they
had
come
opposite
georgie
house
and
suddenly
his
window
was
thrown
up
olga
head
looked
out
do
have
a
fit
georgie
to
find
me
here
she
said
good
morning
mrs
lucas
you
were
behind
the
mulberry
and
i
did
see
you
but
something
happened
to
my
kitchen
range
and
i
ca
have
lunch
at
home
do
give
me
some
i
brought
my
crystal
and
we
gaze
and
gaze
i
can
see
nothing
at
present
except
my
own
nose
and
the
window
are
you
psychical
mrs
lucas
this
was
the
last
straw
all
lucia
grievances
had
been
flocking
together
like
swallows
for
their
flight
and
to
crown
all
came
this
open
annexation
of
georgie
there
was
olga
sitting
in
his
window
all
unasked
and
demanding
lunch
with
her
silly
ridiculous
crystal
in
her
hand
wondering
if
lucia
was
psychical
her
silvery
laugh
was
a
little
shrill
it
started
a
full
tone
above
its
normal
pitch
no
dear
miss
bracely
she
said
i
am
afraid
i
am
much
too
commonplace
and
to
care
about
such
things
it
is
a
great
loss
i
know
and
deprives
me
of
the
pleasant
society
of
russian
princesses
but
we
are
all
made
differently
that
is
very
lucky
i
must
get
home
georgie
it
certainly
seemed
very
lucky
that
everyone
was
not
precisely
like
lucia
at
that
moment
or
there
would
have
been
quarrelling
she
walked
quickly
off
and
georgie
entered
his
house
lucia
had
really
been
remarkably
rude
and
if
allusion
was
made
to
it
he
was
ready
to
confess
that
she
seemed
a
little
worried
friendship
would
allow
that
and
candour
demanded
it
but
no
allusion
of
any
sort
was
made
there
was
a
certain
flush
on
olga
face
and
she
explained
that
she
had
been
sitting
over
the
fire
the
princess
visit
came
to
an
end
next
day
and
all
the
world
knew
that
she
was
going
back
to
london
by
the
express
lady
ambermere
was
quite
aware
of
it
and
drove
in
with
pug
and
miss
lyall
meaning
to
give
her
a
lift
to
the
station
leaving
mrs
quantock
if
she
wanted
to
see
her
guest
off
to
follow
with
the
princess
luggage
in
the
fly
which
no
doubt
had
been
ordered
but
daisy
had
no
intention
of
permitting
this
sort
of
thing
and
drove
calmly
away
with
her
dear
friend
in
georgie
motor
leaving
the
baffled
lady
ambermere
to
follow
or
not
as
she
liked
she
did
like
though
not
much
and
found
herself
on
the
platform
among
a
perfect
crowd
of
riseholmites
who
had
strolled
down
to
the
station
on
this
lovely
morning
to
see
if
parcels
had
come
lady
ambermere
took
very
little
notice
of
them
but
managed
that
pug
should
give
his
paw
to
the
princess
as
she
took
her
seat
and
waved
her
hand
to
mrs
quantock
dear
friend
as
the
train
slid
out
of
the
station
the
late
lord
had
some
russian
relations
she
said
majestically
how
did
you
get
to
know
her
i
met
her
at
potsdam
was
on
the
tip
of
mrs
quantock
tongue
but
she
was
afraid
that
lady
ambermere
might
not
understand
and
ask
her
when
she
had
been
to
potsdam
it
was
grievous
work
making
jokes
for
lady
ambermere
the
train
sped
on
to
london
and
the
princess
opened
the
envelope
which
her
hostess
had
discreetly
put
in
her
hand
and
found
that
was
all
right
her
hostess
had
also
provided
her
with
an
admirable
lunch
which
her
secretary
took
out
of
a
gladstone
bag
when
that
was
finished
she
wanted
her
cigarettes
and
as
she
looked
for
these
and
even
after
she
had
found
them
she
continued
to
search
for
something
else
there
was
the
musical
box
there
and
some
curious
pieces
of
elastic
and
the
violin
was
in
its
case
and
there
was
a
white
mask
but
she
still
continued
to
search
about
the
same
time
as
she
gave
up
the
search
mrs
quantock
wandered
upstairs
to
the
princess
room
a
less
highly
vitalised
nature
than
hers
would
have
been
in
a
stupor
of
content
but
she
was
more
in
a
frenzy
of
content
than
in
a
stupor
how
fine
that
frenzy
was
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
perhaps
the
smallest
ingredient
in
it
was
her
utter
defeat
of
lucia
she
cared
comparatively
little
for
that
glorious
achievement
and
she
was
not
sure
that
when
the
princess
came
back
again
as
she
had
arranged
to
do
on
her
next
holiday
she
would
not
ask
lucia
to
come
to
a
seance
indeed
she
had
little
but
pity
for
the
vanquished
so
great
were
the
spoils
never
had
riseholme
risen
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
and
with
good
cause
had
it
done
so
now
for
of
all
the
wonderful
and
exciting
things
that
had
ever
happened
there
these
seances
were
the
most
delirious
and
better
even
than
the
excitement
of
riseholme
was
the
cause
of
its
excitement
for
spiritualism
and
the
truth
of
inexplicable
psychic
phenomena
had
flashed
upon
them
all
tableaux
romps
yoga
the
moonlight
sonata
shakespeare
christian
science
olga
herself
uric
acid
elizabethan
furniture
the
engagement
of
colonel
boucher
and
mrs
weston
all
these
tremendous
topics
had
paled
like
fire
in
the
sunlight
before
the
revelation
that
had
now
dawned
by
practice
and
patience
by
zealous
concentration
on
crystals
and
palms
by
the
waiting
for
automatic
script
to
develop
you
attained
to
the
highest
mysteries
and
could
evoke
cardinal
newman
or
pocky
there
was
the
bed
in
which
the
sybil
had
slept
there
was
the
fresh
vase
of
flowers
difficult
to
procure
in
november
but
still
obtainable
which
she
loved
to
have
standing
near
her
there
was
the
chest
of
drawers
in
which
she
had
put
her
clothes
and
mrs
quantock
pulled
them
open
one
by
one
finding
fresh
emanations
and
vibrations
everywhere
the
lowest
one
stuck
a
little
and
she
had
to
use
force
to
it
the
smile
was
struck
from
her
face
as
it
flew
open
inside
it
were
billows
and
billows
of
the
finest
possible
muslin
fold
after
fold
of
it
she
drew
out
and
with
it
there
came
a
pair
of
false
eyebrows
she
recognised
them
at
once
as
being
amadeo
the
muslin
belonged
to
pocky
as
well
she
needed
but
a
moment
concentrated
thought
and
in
swift
succession
rejected
two
courses
of
action
that
suggested
themselves
the
first
was
to
use
the
muslin
herself
it
would
make
summer
garments
for
years
the
chief
reason
against
that
was
that
she
was
a
little
old
for
muslin
the
second
course
was
to
send
the
whole
paraphernalia
back
to
her
dear
friend
with
or
without
a
comment
but
that
would
be
tantamount
to
a
direct
accusation
of
fraud
never
any
more
if
she
did
that
could
she
dispense
her
dear
friend
to
riseholme
like
an
expensive
drug
she
would
not
so
utterly
burn
her
boats
there
remained
only
one
other
judicious
course
of
action
and
she
got
to
work
it
had
been
a
cold
morning
clear
and
frosty
and
she
had
caused
a
good
fire
to
be
lit
in
the
princess
bedroom
for
her
to
dress
by
it
still
prospered
in
the
grate
and
mrs
quantock
having
shut
the
door
and
locked
it
put
on
to
it
the
false
eyebrows
which
as
they
turned
to
ash
flew
up
the
chimney
then
she
fed
it
with
muslin
yards
and
yards
of
muslin
she
poured
on
to
it
never
had
there
been
so
much
muslin
nor
that
so
exquisitely
fine
it
went
to
her
heart
to
burn
it
but
there
was
no
time
for
minor
considerations
every
atom
of
that
evidence
must
be
purged
by
fire
the
princess
would
certainly
not
write
and
say
that
she
had
left
some
eyebrows
and
a
hundred
yards
of
muslin
behind
her
for
knowing
what
she
did
it
would
be
to
her
interests
as
well
as
mrs
quantock
that
those
properties
should
vanish
as
if
they
never
had
been
up
the
chimney
in
sheets
of
flame
went
this
delightful
fabric
sometimes
it
roared
there
as
if
it
had
set
the
chimney
on
fire
and
she
had
to
pause
shielding
her
scorched
face
until
the
hollow
rumbling
had
died
down
but
at
last
the
holocaust
was
over
and
she
unlocked
the
door
again
no
one
knew
but
she
and
no
one
should
ever
know
the
guru
had
turned
out
to
be
a
but
no
intruding
hermy
had
been
here
this
time
as
long
as
crystals
fascinated
and
automatic
writing
flourished
the
secret
of
the
muslin
and
the
eyebrows
should
repose
in
one
bosom
alone
riseholme
had
been
electrified
by
spiritualism
and
even
now
the
seances
had
been
cheap
at
the
price
and
in
spite
of
this
discovery
she
felt
by
no
means
sure
that
she
would
not
ask
the
princess
to
come
again
and
minister
to
their
spiritual
needs
she
had
hardly
got
downstairs
when
robert
came
in
from
the
green
where
he
had
been
recounting
the
experiences
of
the
last
seance
looked
as
if
there
was
a
chimney
on
fire
he
said
i
wish
it
was
the
kitchen
chimney
then
perhaps
the
beef
might
be
so
raw
as
it
was
yesterday
thus
is
comedy
intertwined
with
tragedy
chapter
fourteen
georgie
was
very
busily
engaged
during
the
first
weeks
of
december
on
a
sketch
of
olga
sitting
at
her
piano
and
singing
the
difficulty
of
it
was
such
that
at
times
he
almost
despaired
of
accomplishing
it
for
the
problem
of
how
to
draw
her
face
and
her
mouth
wide
open
and
yet
retain
the
likeness
seemed
almost
insoluble
often
he
sat
in
front
of
his
own
with
his
mouth
open
and
diligently
drew
his
own
face
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
principles
of
the
changes
of
line
which
took
place
certainly
the
shape
of
a
face
when
his
mouth
was
wide
open
altered
so
completely
that
you
would
have
thought
him
quite
unrecognisable
however
skilfully
the
artist
reproduced
his
elongated
countenance
and
yet
georgie
could
easily
recognise
that
face
in
the
glass
as
his
forehead
eyes
and
alone
retained
their
wonted
aspect
even
the
nose
seemed
to
lengthen
if
you
opened
your
mouth
very
wide
then
how
again
was
he
to
indicate
that
she
was
singing
and
not
yawning
or
preparing
for
a
sneeze
his
most
successful
sketch
at
present
looked
precisely
as
if
she
was
yawning
and
made
georgie
jaws
long
to
yawn
too
perhaps
the
shape
of
the
mouth
in
the
two
positions
was
really
the
same
and
it
was
only
the
sound
that
led
you
to
suppose
that
an
person
was
singing
but
perhaps
the
piano
would
supply
the
necessary
suggestion
olga
would
not
sit
down
at
the
piano
merely
to
yawn
or
sneeze
for
she
could
do
that
anywhere
then
a
brilliant
idea
struck
him
he
would
introduce
a
shaded
lamp
standing
on
the
piano
and
then
her
face
would
be
in
red
shadow
naturally
this
entailed
fresh
problems
with
regard
to
light
but
light
seemed
to
present
less
difficulty
than
likeness
besides
he
could
make
her
dress
and
the
keys
of
the
piano
very
like
indeed
but
when
he
came
to
painting
again
he
despaired
there
must
be
red
shadow
on
her
face
and
yellow
light
on
her
hands
and
on
her
green
dress
and
presently
the
whole
thing
looked
not
so
much
like
olga
singing
by
as
a
spread
out
in
the
sunlight
the
more
he
painted
the
more
vividly
did
the
lettuce
leaves
and
the
dressing
and
the
lobster
emerge
from
the
paper
so
he
took
away
the
lamp
and
shut
olga
mouth
and
there
she
would
be
at
her
piano
just
going
to
sing
these
artistic
agonies
had
rewards
which
more
than
compensated
for
them
for
regularly
now
he
took
his
and
his
across
to
her
house
and
sat
with
her
while
she
practised
there
were
none
of
love
lilies
low
or
yawning
york
now
for
she
was
very
busy
learning
her
part
in
lucretia
spending
a
solid
two
hours
at
it
every
morning
and
georgie
began
to
perceive
what
sort
of
work
it
implied
to
produce
the
spontaneous
ease
with
which
brunnhilde
hailed
the
sun
more
astounding
even
was
the
fact
that
this
mere
learning
of
notes
was
but
the
preliminary
to
what
she
called
real
work
and
when
she
had
got
through
the
mere
mechanical
part
of
it
she
would
have
to
study
then
when
her
practice
was
over
she
would
indulgently
sit
with
her
head
in
profile
against
a
dark
background
and
georgie
would
suck
one
end
of
his
brush
and
bite
the
other
and
wonder
whether
he
would
ever
produce
anything
which
he
could
dare
to
offer
her
by
daily
poring
on
her
face
he
grew
not
to
admire
only
but
to
adore
its
youth
and
beauty
by
daily
contact
with
her
he
began
to
see
how
fresh
and
how
lovely
was
the
mind
that
illuminated
it
georgie
i
going
to
scold
you
she
said
one
day
as
she
took
up
her
place
against
the
black
panel
you
a
selfish
little
brute
you
think
of
nothing
but
your
own
amusement
did
that
ever
strike
you
georgie
gasped
with
surprise
here
was
he
spending
the
whole
of
every
morning
trying
to
do
something
which
would
be
a
worthy
christmas
present
for
her
to
say
nothing
of
the
hours
he
had
spent
with
his
mouth
open
in
front
of
his
glass
and
the
cost
of
the
beautiful
frame
which
he
had
ordered
and
yet
he
was
supposed
to
be
only
thinking
about
himself
of
course
olga
did
not
know
that
the
picture
was
to
be
hers
how
tarsome
you
are
he
said
you
always
finding
fault
with
me
explain
well
you
neglecting
your
old
friends
for
your
new
one
she
said
my
dear
you
should
never
drop
an
old
friend
for
instance
when
did
you
last
play
duets
with
mrs
lucas
oh
not
so
very
long
ago
said
georgie
quite
long
enough
i
am
sure
but
i
do
actually
mean
sitting
down
and
thumping
the
piano
with
her
when
did
you
last
think
about
her
and
make
plans
for
her
and
talk
who
told
you
i
ever
did
asked
georgie
gracious
how
can
i
possibly
remember
that
sort
of
thing
i
should
say
at
a
guess
that
everybody
told
me
now
poor
mrs
lucas
is
feeling
out
of
it
and
neglected
and
dethroned
it
all
on
my
mind
rather
and
talking
to
you
about
it
because
it
largely
your
fault
now
talking
quite
frankly
so
do
fence
and
say
it
mine
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
but
you
are
perfectly
wrong
primarily
it
mrs
lucas
fault
because
she
quite
the
stupidest
woman
i
ever
saw
but
it
partly
your
fault
too
she
turned
round
come
georgie
let
have
it
out
she
said
i
perfectly
powerless
to
do
anything
because
she
detests
me
and
you
got
to
help
her
and
help
me
and
drop
your
selfishness
before
i
came
here
she
used
to
run
you
all
and
give
you
treats
like
going
to
her
tableaux
and
listening
to
her
stupid
old
moonlight
sonata
and
talking
seven
words
of
italian
and
then
i
came
along
with
no
earthly
intention
except
to
enjoy
my
holidays
and
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
i
was
trying
to
run
the
place
instead
of
her
is
that
so
just
say
yes
said
georgie
well
that
puts
me
in
an
odious
position
and
a
helpless
position
i
did
my
best
to
be
nice
to
her
i
went
to
her
house
until
she
ceased
to
ask
me
and
asked
her
here
for
everything
that
i
thought
would
amuse
her
until
she
ceased
to
come
i
took
no
notice
of
her
rudeness
which
was
remarkable
or
of
her
absurd
patronising
airs
which
did
hurt
me
in
the
smallest
degree
but
georgie
she
would
continue
to
make
such
a
dreadful
ass
of
herself
and
think
it
was
my
fault
was
it
my
fault
that
she
did
know
the
spanish
quartette
when
she
heard
it
or
that
she
did
know
a
word
of
italian
when
she
pretended
she
did
or
that
the
other
day
it
was
the
last
time
i
saw
her
when
you
played
your
debussy
to
us
at
aunt
jane
she
talked
to
me
about
inverted
fifths
olga
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
georgie
assumed
the
riseholme
face
of
intense
curiosity
you
must
tell
me
all
about
that
he
said
and
i
tell
you
the
rest
which
you
do
know
olga
succumbed
too
and
began
to
talk
in
aunt
jane
voice
for
she
had
adopted
her
as
an
aunt
well
it
was
last
monday
week
she
said
or
was
it
sunday
no
it
could
have
been
sunday
because
i
do
have
anybody
to
tea
that
day
as
elizabeth
goes
over
to
jacob
and
spends
the
afternoon
with
atkinson
or
the
other
way
about
which
does
signify
as
the
point
is
that
elizabeth
should
be
free
so
it
was
monday
and
aunt
jane
me
talking
again
had
the
at
which
you
played
poisson
and
when
it
was
finished
mrs
lucas
gave
a
great
sigh
and
said
georgino
wasting
his
time
over
that
rubbish
though
she
knew
quite
well
that
i
had
given
it
to
you
and
so
i
said
you
call
it
rubbish
do
you
think
and
she
said
every
rule
of
music
is
violated
do
those
inverted
fifths
make
you
wince
miss
bracely
olga
laughed
again
and
spoke
in
her
own
voice
oh
georgie
she
is
an
ass
she
said
what
she
meant
i
suppose
was
consecutive
fifths
you
ca
invert
a
fifth
so
i
said
i
really
meant
it
as
a
joke
course
there
is
that
but
you
must
forgive
debussy
that
for
the
sake
of
that
wonderful
passage
of
submerged
tenths
and
she
took
it
quite
gravely
and
shook
her
head
and
said
she
was
afraid
she
was
a
purist
what
happened
next
that
all
i
know
directly
afterwards
said
georgie
she
brought
the
music
to
me
and
asked
me
to
show
her
where
the
passage
of
tenths
came
i
did
know
but
i
found
some
tenths
and
she
brightened
up
and
said
it
is
true
those
submerged
tenths
are
very
impressive
then
i
suggested
that
the
submerged
tenth
was
not
a
musical
expression
but
referred
to
a
section
of
the
population
on
which
she
said
no
more
but
when
she
went
away
she
asked
me
to
send
her
some
book
on
i
daresay
she
is
looking
for
the
submerged
tenth
still
olga
lit
a
cigarette
and
became
grave
again
well
it
ca
go
on
she
said
we
ca
have
the
poor
thing
feeling
angry
and
out
of
it
then
there
was
mrs
quantock
absolutely
refusing
to
let
her
see
the
princess
that
was
her
own
fault
said
georgie
it
was
because
she
was
so
greedy
about
the
guru
that
makes
it
all
the
bitterer
and
i
ca
do
anything
because
she
blames
me
for
it
all
i
would
ask
her
and
her
peppino
here
every
night
and
listen
to
her
dreary
tunes
every
evening
and
let
her
have
it
all
her
own
way
if
it
would
do
any
good
but
things
have
gone
too
far
she
would
come
it
has
all
happened
without
my
noticing
it
i
never
added
it
all
up
as
it
went
along
and
i
hate
it
georgie
thought
of
the
spiritualistic
truths
if
you
an
incarnation
he
said
in
a
sudden
glow
of
admiration
you
the
incarnation
of
an
angel
how
you
can
forgive
her
odious
manners
to
you
my
dear
shut
up
said
olga
we
got
to
do
something
now
how
would
it
be
if
you
gave
a
nice
party
on
christmas
night
and
asked
her
at
once
ask
her
to
help
you
in
getting
it
up
make
it
clear
going
to
run
it
all
right
you
come
wo
you
certainly
i
will
not
perhaps
i
will
come
in
after
dinner
with
goosie
or
some
one
of
that
sort
do
you
see
it
would
spoil
it
all
if
i
were
at
dinner
you
must
rather
pointedly
leave
me
out
give
her
a
nice
expensive
refined
christmas
present
too
you
might
give
her
that
picture
you
doing
of
me
no
i
suppose
she
would
like
that
but
just
comfort
her
and
make
her
feel
you
ca
get
on
without
her
been
her
right
hand
all
these
years
make
her
give
her
tableaux
again
and
then
i
think
you
must
ask
me
in
afterwards
i
long
to
see
her
and
peppino
as
brunnhilde
and
siegfried
just
attend
to
her
georgie
and
buck
her
up
promise
me
you
will
and
do
it
as
if
your
heart
was
in
it
otherwise
it
no
good
georgie
began
packing
up
his
this
was
not
the
plan
he
had
hoped
for
on
christmas
day
but
if
olga
wished
this
it
had
got
to
be
done
well
i
do
my
best
he
said
thanks
ever
so
much
you
a
darling
and
how
is
your
planchette
getting
on
i
been
lazy
about
my
crystal
but
i
get
so
tired
of
my
own
nose
planchette
would
write
nothing
but
a
few
names
said
georgie
omitting
the
fact
that
olga
was
the
most
frequent
i
think
i
shall
drop
it
this
was
but
reasonable
for
since
riseholme
had
some
new
and
absorbing
excitement
every
few
weeks
to
say
nothing
of
the
current
excitement
of
daily
life
it
followed
that
even
the
most
thrilling
pursuits
could
not
hold
the
stage
for
very
long
still
the
interest
in
spiritualism
had
died
down
with
the
rapidity
of
the
seed
on
stony
ground
even
mrs
quantock
seems
to
have
cooled
said
olga
she
and
her
husband
were
here
last
night
and
they
looked
rather
bored
when
i
suggested
i
wonder
if
anything
has
happened
to
put
her
off
it
what
do
you
think
could
have
asked
georgie
with
riseholme
alacrity
georgie
do
you
really
believe
in
the
princess
and
pocky
she
asked
georgie
looked
round
to
see
that
there
was
no
one
within
hearing
i
did
at
the
time
he
said
at
least
i
think
i
did
but
it
seems
less
likely
now
who
was
the
princess
anyway
why
did
we
ever
hear
of
her
before
i
believe
mrs
quantock
met
her
in
the
train
or
something
so
do
i
said
olga
but
not
a
word
it
makes
aunt
jane
and
uncle
jacob
completely
happy
to
believe
in
it
all
their
lines
of
life
are
enormous
and
they
wo
die
till
they
over
a
hundred
now
go
and
see
mrs
lucas
and
if
she
does
ask
you
to
lunch
you
can
come
back
here
georgie
put
down
his
picture
and
at
his
house
and
went
on
to
lucia
definitely
conscious
that
though
he
did
not
want
to
have
her
to
dinner
on
christmas
day
or
go
back
to
his
duets
and
his
duties
there
was
a
spice
and
savour
in
so
doing
that
came
entirely
from
the
fact
that
olga
wished
him
to
that
by
this
service
he
was
pleasing
her
in
itself
it
was
distasteful
in
itself
it
tended
to
cut
him
off
from
her
if
he
had
to
devote
his
time
to
lucia
but
he
still
delighted
in
doing
it
i
believe
i
am
falling
in
love
with
her
this
time
said
georgie
to
himself
she
wonderful
she
big
she
at
that
moment
his
thoughts
were
violently
diverted
for
robert
quantock
came
out
of
his
house
in
a
tremendous
hurry
merely
scowling
at
georgie
and
positively
trotted
across
the
green
in
the
direction
of
the
instantly
georgie
recollected
that
he
had
seen
him
there
already
this
morning
before
his
visit
to
olga
buying
a
new
twopenny
paper
in
a
yellow
cover
called
todd
news
they
had
had
a
few
words
of
genial
conversation
and
what
could
have
happened
in
the
last
two
hours
that
made
robert
merely
gnash
his
teeth
at
georgie
now
and
make
a
second
visit
to
the
it
was
impossible
not
to
linger
a
moment
and
see
what
robert
did
when
he
got
to
the
and
with
the
aid
of
his
spectacles
georgie
perceived
that
he
presently
loaded
himself
with
a
whole
packet
of
papers
in
yellow
covers
presumably
todd
news
flesh
and
blood
could
not
resist
the
cravings
of
curiosity
and
making
a
detour
so
as
to
avoid
being
gnashed
at
again
by
robert
who
was
coming
rapidly
back
in
his
direction
he
strolled
round
to
the
and
asked
for
a
copy
of
todd
news
instantly
the
bright
december
morning
grew
dark
with
mystery
for
the
proprietor
told
him
that
mr
quantock
has
bought
every
copy
he
possessed
of
it
no
further
information
could
be
obtained
except
that
he
had
bought
a
copy
of
every
other
daily
paper
as
well
georgie
could
make
nothing
of
it
whatever
and
having
observed
robert
hurry
into
his
house
again
went
on
his
errand
to
lucia
had
he
seen
what
robert
did
when
he
got
home
it
is
doubtful
if
he
could
have
avoided
breaking
into
the
house
and
snatching
a
copy
of
todd
news
from
him
robert
went
to
his
study
and
locked
the
door
he
drew
out
from
under
his
the
first
copy
of
todd
news
that
he
bought
earlier
in
the
morning
and
put
it
with
the
rest
then
with
a
furrowed
brow
he
turned
to
the
in
the
times
and
after
looking
at
them
laid
the
paper
down
he
did
the
same
to
the
daily
telegraph
the
daily
mail
the
morning
post
the
daily
chronicle
finally
this
was
the
last
of
the
daily
papers
he
perused
the
daily
mirror
tore
it
in
shreds
and
said
damn
he
sat
for
a
while
in
thought
trying
to
recollect
if
anybody
in
riseholme
except
colonel
boucher
took
in
the
daily
mirror
but
he
felt
morally
certain
that
no
one
did
and
letting
himself
out
of
his
study
and
again
locking
the
door
after
him
he
went
into
the
street
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
colonel
was
employed
in
whirling
mrs
weston
round
the
green
instead
of
joining
them
he
hurried
to
the
colonel
house
and
for
there
was
no
time
for
fixed
atkinson
with
his
eye
and
said
he
would
like
to
write
a
note
to
colonel
boucher
he
was
shown
into
his
and
saw
the
daily
mirror
lying
open
on
the
table
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
he
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
told
atkinson
he
would
speak
to
the
colonel
instead
and
intercepted
the
path
of
the
he
was
nearly
run
over
but
stood
his
ground
and
in
a
perfectly
firm
voice
asked
the
colonel
if
there
was
any
news
in
the
morning
papers
with
the
decided
negative
ringing
joyfully
in
his
ears
he
went
home
again
and
locked
himself
for
the
second
time
into
his
study
there
is
a
luxury
when
some
fell
danger
has
been
averted
by
promptness
and
presence
of
mind
in
living
through
the
moments
of
that
danger
again
and
robert
opened
todd
news
for
that
gave
the
fuller
account
and
read
over
the
paragraph
in
the
police
news
headed
bogus
russian
princess
but
now
he
gloated
over
the
lines
which
had
made
him
shudder
before
when
he
read
how
marie
lowenstein
of
gerald
street
charing
cross
road
calling
herself
princess
popoffski
had
been
brought
up
at
the
bow
street
police
court
for
fraudulently
professing
to
tell
fortunes
and
produce
materialised
spirits
at
a
seance
in
her
flat
sordid
details
followed
a
detective
who
had
been
there
seized
an
apparition
by
the
throat
and
turned
on
the
electric
light
it
was
the
woman
popoffski
throat
that
he
held
and
her
secretary
hezekiah
schwarz
was
discovered
under
the
table
detaching
an
electric
hammer
a
fine
was
inflicted
a
moment
mental
debate
was
sufficient
to
determine
robert
not
to
tell
his
wife
it
was
true
that
she
had
produced
popoffski
but
then
he
had
praised
and
applauded
her
for
that
he
no
less
than
she
had
been
convinced
of
popoffski
integrity
high
rank
and
marvellous
psychic
powers
and
together
they
had
soared
to
a
pinnacle
of
unexampled
greatness
in
the
riseholme
world
besides
poor
daisy
would
be
simply
flattened
out
if
she
knew
that
popoffski
was
no
better
than
the
guru
he
glanced
at
the
pile
of
papers
and
at
the
fire
place
it
had
been
a
cold
morning
clear
and
frosty
and
a
good
blaze
prospered
in
the
grate
out
of
each
copy
of
todd
news
he
tore
the
page
on
which
were
printed
the
police
reports
and
fed
the
fire
with
them
page
after
page
he
put
upon
it
never
had
so
much
paper
been
devoted
to
one
grate
up
the
chimney
they
flew
in
sheets
of
flame
sometimes
he
was
afraid
he
had
set
it
on
fire
and
he
had
to
pause
shielding
his
scorched
face
until
the
hollow
rumbling
had
died
down
with
the
page
from
two
copies
of
the
daily
mirror
the
holocaust
was
over
and
he
unlocked
the
door
again
no
one
in
riseholme
knew
but
he
and
no
one
should
ever
know
riseholme
had
been
electrified
by
spiritualism
and
even
now
the
seances
had
been
cheap
at
the
price
the
debris
of
all
these
papers
he
caused
to
be
removed
by
the
housemaid
and
this
was
hardly
done
when
his
wife
came
in
from
the
green
i
thought
there
was
a
chimney
on
fire
robert
she
said
you
would
have
liked
it
to
be
the
as
you
said
the
other
day
stuff
and
nonsense
my
dear
said
he
is
it
yes
ah
there
the
post
none
for
me
and
two
for
you
she
looked
at
him
narrowly
as
he
took
his
letters
perhaps
their
subconscious
minds
according
to
her
dear
friend
theory
held
communication
but
only
the
faintest
unintelligible
ripple
of
that
appeared
on
the
surface
i
have
heard
from
my
princess
since
she
went
away
she
remarked
robert
gave
a
slight
start
he
was
a
little
off
his
guard
from
the
reaction
after
his
anxiety
indeed
he
said
have
you
written
to
her
she
appeared
to
try
to
remember
well
i
really
do
believe
i
have
she
said
that
is
remiss
of
me
i
must
send
her
a
long
budget
one
of
these
days
this
time
he
looked
narrowly
at
her
had
she
a
secret
he
wondered
as
well
as
he
what
could
it
be
georgie
found
his
mission
none
too
easy
and
it
was
only
the
thought
that
it
was
a
labour
of
love
or
something
very
like
it
that
enabled
him
to
persevere
even
then
for
the
first
few
minutes
he
thought
it
might
prove
love
labour
lost
so
bright
and
unreal
was
lucia
he
had
half
crossed
shakespeare
garden
and
had
clearly
seen
her
standing
at
the
window
of
the
when
she
stole
away
and
next
moment
the
strains
of
some
slow
movement
played
very
loud
drowned
the
bell
on
the
mermaid
tail
so
completely
that
he
wondered
whether
it
had
rung
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
lucia
and
peppino
were
in
the
midst
of
a
most
serious
conversation
when
georgie
came
through
the
gate
which
was
concerned
with
deciding
what
was
to
be
done
a
party
at
the
hurst
sometime
during
christmas
week
was
as
regular
as
the
festival
itself
but
this
year
everything
was
so
unusual
who
were
to
be
asked
in
the
first
place
certainly
not
mrs
weston
for
she
had
talked
italian
to
lucia
in
a
manner
impossible
to
misinterpret
and
probably
so
said
lucia
with
great
acidity
she
would
be
playing
children
games
with
her
it
was
equally
impossible
to
ask
miss
bracely
and
her
husband
for
relations
were
already
severed
on
account
of
the
spanish
quartette
and
signer
cortese
and
as
for
the
quantocks
did
peppino
expect
lucia
to
ask
mrs
quantock
again
ever
then
there
was
georgie
who
had
become
so
different
and
strange
and
well
here
was
georgie
hastily
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
peppino
closed
his
eyes
for
the
slow
movement
the
opening
of
the
door
was
lost
on
lucia
and
peppino
eyes
were
closed
consequently
georgie
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
waited
at
the
end
peppino
sighed
and
he
sighed
too
who
is
that
said
lucia
sharply
why
is
it
you
georgie
what
a
stranger
are
you
any
news
this
was
all
delivered
in
the
coldest
of
tones
and
lucia
snatched
a
morsel
of
wax
off
eb
i
heard
none
said
georgie
in
great
discomfort
i
just
dropped
in
lucia
fixed
peppino
with
a
glance
if
she
had
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
she
could
not
have
conveyed
more
unmistakably
that
she
was
going
to
manage
this
situation
ah
that
is
very
pleasant
she
said
peppino
and
i
have
been
so
busy
lately
that
we
have
seen
nobody
we
are
quite
and
so
the
must
spare
us
a
little
cheese
how
is
dear
miss
bracely
now
very
well
said
georgie
i
saw
her
this
morning
lucia
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
that
is
good
she
said
peppino
do
you
hear
miss
bracely
is
quite
well
not
overtired
with
practising
that
new
opera
lucy
grecian
was
it
oh
how
silly
i
am
lucretia
that
was
it
by
that
extraordinary
neapolitan
yes
and
what
next
our
good
mrs
weston
now
still
thinking
about
her
nice
young
man
making
wreaths
and
choosing
bridesmaids
how
naughty
i
am
yes
and
then
dear
daisy
how
is
she
still
entertaining
princesses
i
look
in
the
court
circular
every
morning
to
see
if
princess
pop
pop
popoff
is
it
if
princess
popoff
has
popped
off
to
see
her
cousin
the
czar
again
dear
me
the
amount
of
malice
envy
and
all
uncharitableness
which
lucia
managed
to
put
into
this
quite
unrehearsed
speech
was
positively
amazing
she
had
not
thought
it
over
beforehand
for
a
moment
it
came
out
with
the
august
spontaneity
of
lightning
leaping
from
a
cloud
not
till
that
moment
had
georgie
guessed
at
a
tithe
of
all
that
olga
had
felt
so
certain
about
and
a
double
emotion
took
hold
of
him
he
was
immensely
sorry
for
lucia
never
having
conjectured
how
she
must
have
suffered
before
she
attained
to
so
superb
a
sourness
and
he
adored
the
intuition
that
had
guessed
it
and
wanted
to
sweeten
it
the
outburst
was
not
quite
over
yet
though
lucia
felt
distinctly
better
and
you
georgie
she
said
though
i
sure
we
are
such
strangers
that
i
ought
to
call
you
mr
pillson
what
have
you
been
doing
playing
miss
bracely
accompaniments
and
sewing
all
day
and
raising
spooks
all
night
yes
lucia
had
caught
this
yes
from
lady
ambermere
having
found
it
peculiarly
obnoxious
you
laid
down
a
proposition
or
asked
a
question
and
then
confirmed
it
yourself
and
mr
cortese
she
said
is
he
still
roaring
out
his
marvellous
english
and
italian
yes
what
a
full
life
you
lead
georgie
i
suppose
you
have
no
time
for
your
painting
now
this
was
not
a
bow
drawn
at
a
venture
for
she
had
seen
georgie
come
out
of
old
place
with
his
and
but
this
direct
attack
on
him
did
not
lessen
the
power
of
the
sweet
charity
which
had
sent
him
here
he
blew
the
bugle
to
rally
all
the
for
which
he
was
capable
no
i
have
been
painting
lately
he
said
at
least
i
have
been
trying
to
i
doing
a
little
sketch
of
miss
bracely
at
her
piano
which
i
want
to
give
her
on
christmas
day
but
it
so
difficult
i
wish
i
had
brought
it
round
to
ask
your
advice
but
you
would
only
have
screamed
with
laughter
at
it
it
a
dreadful
failure
much
worse
than
those
i
gave
you
for
your
birthdays
fancy
your
keeping
them
still
in
your
lovely
send
them
to
the
pantry
and
i
do
something
better
for
you
next
lucia
try
as
she
might
could
not
help
being
rather
touched
by
that
there
they
all
were
golden
autumn
woodland
bleak
december
yellow
daffodils
and
roses
of
or
have
them
blacked
over
by
the
she
said
take
them
down
georgie
and
let
me
send
them
to
be
blacked
this
was
much
better
there
was
playfulness
behind
the
sarcasm
now
which
peeped
out
from
it
he
made
the
most
of
that
we
do
that
presently
he
said
just
now
i
want
to
engage
you
and
peppino
to
dine
with
me
on
christmas
day
now
do
be
tarsome
and
say
you
engaged
but
one
can
never
tell
with
you
a
party
asked
lucia
suspiciously
well
i
thought
we
would
have
just
one
of
our
old
evenings
together
again
said
georgie
feeling
himself
remarkably
clever
we
have
the
quantocks
sha
we
and
colonel
and
mrs
colonel
and
you
and
peppino
and
me
and
mrs
rumbold
that
make
eight
which
is
more
than
foljambe
likes
but
she
must
lump
it
mr
rumbold
is
always
singing
carols
all
christmas
evening
with
the
choir
and
she
will
be
alone
ah
those
carols
said
lucia
wincing
i
know
i
will
provide
you
with
little
wads
of
do
come
and
we
have
just
a
party
of
eight
i
asked
no
one
yet
and
perhaps
nobody
will
come
i
want
you
and
peppino
and
the
rest
may
come
or
stop
away
do
say
you
approve
lucia
could
not
yield
at
once
she
had
to
press
her
fingers
to
her
forehead
so
kind
of
you
georgie
she
said
but
i
must
think
are
we
doing
anything
on
christmas
night
carrissimo
where
your
go
and
consult
it
this
was
a
grand
manoeuvre
for
hardly
had
peppino
left
the
room
when
she
started
up
with
a
little
scream
and
ran
after
him
me
so
stupid
she
cried
me
put
it
in
and
poor
caro
will
look
for
it
ever
so
long
back
in
minute
georgino
naturally
this
was
perfectly
clear
to
georgie
she
wanted
to
have
a
short
private
consultation
with
peppino
and
he
waited
rather
hopefully
for
their
return
for
peppino
he
felt
sure
was
bored
with
this
of
sitting
sulking
in
the
tent
they
came
back
wreathed
in
smiles
and
instantly
embarked
on
the
question
of
what
to
do
after
dinner
no
romps
certainly
not
but
why
not
the
tableaux
again
the
question
was
still
under
debate
when
they
went
in
to
lunch
it
was
settled
affirmatively
during
the
macaroni
and
lucia
said
that
they
all
wanted
to
work
her
to
death
and
so
get
rid
of
her
they
had
thought
she
and
peppino
of
having
a
little
holiday
on
the
riviera
but
anyhow
they
would
put
if
off
till
after
christmas
georgie
mouth
was
full
of
crashing
toast
at
the
moment
and
he
could
only
shake
his
head
but
as
soon
as
the
toast
could
be
swallowed
he
made
the
usual
reply
with
great
fervour
georgie
was
hardly
at
all
complacent
when
he
walked
home
afterwards
and
thought
how
extremely
he
had
been
for
he
could
not
but
feel
that
this
marvellous
forbearance
was
a
sort
of
mistletoe
growth
on
him
quite
foreign
really
to
his
nature
never
before
had
lucia
showed
so
shrewish
and
venomous
a
temper
he
had
not
thought
her
capable
of
it
for
the
gracious
queen
there
was
substituted
a
snarling
but
then
as
georgie
calmly
pursued
the
pacific
mission
of
comfort
to
which
olga
had
ordained
him
how
the
wrinkles
had
been
smoothed
out
and
the
asps
withered
from
her
tongue
had
his
imagination
ever
pictured
lucia
saying
such
things
to
him
it
would
have
supplied
him
with
no
sequel
but
a
complete
severance
of
relations
between
them
instead
of
that
he
had
consulted
her
and
truckled
to
her
truckled
yes
he
had
truckled
and
he
was
astonished
at
himself
why
had
he
truckled
and
the
beautiful
mouth
and
kindly
eyes
of
olga
supplied
the
answer
certainly
he
must
drop
in
at
once
and
tell
her
the
result
of
the
mission
perhaps
she
would
reward
him
by
calling
him
a
darling
again
really
he
deserved
that
she
should
say
something
nice
to
him
it
was
a
day
of
surprises
for
georgie
he
found
olga
at
home
and
recounted
without
loving
any
of
the
substance
the
sarcasms
of
lucia
and
his
own
amazing
tact
and
forbearance
he
did
not
comment
he
just
narrated
the
facts
in
the
vivid
riseholme
manner
and
waited
for
his
reward
olga
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
then
she
deliberately
wiped
her
eyes
oh
poor
mrs
lucas
she
said
she
must
have
been
miserable
to
have
behaved
like
that
i
am
so
sorry
now
what
else
can
you
do
georgie
to
make
her
feel
better
i
think
i
done
everything
that
could
have
been
required
of
said
georgie
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
my
temper
at
all
i
will
give
my
party
at
christmas
because
i
promised
you
i
would
oh
but
it
ten
days
to
christmas
yet
said
olga
ca
you
paint
her
portrait
and
give
it
her
for
a
present
oh
i
think
you
could
playing
the
georgie
felt
terribly
inclined
to
be
offended
and
tell
olga
that
she
was
tired
of
him
or
to
be
dignified
and
say
he
was
unusually
busy
never
had
he
shown
such
forbearance
towards
downright
rudeness
as
he
had
shown
to
lucia
and
though
he
had
shown
that
for
olga
sake
she
seemed
to
be
without
a
single
spark
of
gratitude
but
continued
to
urge
her
request
do
paint
a
little
picture
of
her
she
repeated
she
would
love
it
and
make
it
young
and
interesting
think
over
it
anyhow
perhaps
you
think
of
something
better
than
that
and
now
wo
you
go
and
secure
all
your
guests
for
christmas
at
once
georgie
turned
to
leave
the
room
but
just
as
he
got
to
the
door
she
spoke
again
i
think
you
a
brick
she
said
somehow
this
undemonstrative
expression
of
approval
began
to
glow
in
georgie
heart
as
he
walked
home
apparently
she
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
going
to
behave
with
all
the
perfect
tact
and
that
he
had
shown
it
did
not
surprise
her
in
the
least
she
had
almost
forgotten
to
indicate
that
she
had
noticed
it
at
all
and
that
as
he
thought
about
it
seemed
a
far
deeper
compliment
than
if
she
had
told
him
how
wonderful
he
was
she
took
it
for
granted
no
more
nor
less
that
he
would
be
kind
and
pleasant
whatever
lucia
said
he
had
not
fallen
short
of
her
standard
chapter
fifteen
georgie
christmas
party
had
just
taken
its
seats
at
his
round
rosewood
table
without
a
cloth
and
he
hoped
that
foljambe
would
be
quick
with
the
champagne
because
there
had
been
rather
a
long
wait
before
dinner
owing
to
lucia
and
peppino
being
late
and
conversation
had
been
a
little
jerky
lucia
as
usual
had
sailed
into
the
room
without
a
word
of
apology
for
she
was
accustomed
to
come
last
when
she
went
out
to
dinner
and
on
her
arrival
dinner
was
always
announced
immediately
the
few
seconds
that
intervened
were
employed
by
her
in
saying
just
one
kind
word
to
everybody
tonight
however
these
gratifying
utterances
had
not
been
received
with
the
gratified
responses
to
which
she
was
accustomed
there
was
a
different
atmosphere
abroad
and
it
was
as
if
she
were
no
more
than
of
the
entire
party
but
it
would
never
do
to
hurry
foljambe
who
was
a
little
upset
already
by
the
fact
of
there
being
eight
to
dinner
which
was
two
more
than
she
approved
of
lucia
was
on
georgie
right
mrs
colonel
as
she
had
decided
to
call
herself
on
his
left
next
her
was
peppino
then
mrs
quantock
then
the
colonel
then
mrs
rumbold
who
resembled
a
grey
hungry
mouse
and
mr
quantock
completed
the
circle
round
to
lucia
again
everyone
had
a
small
bunch
of
violets
in
the
napkin
but
lucia
had
the
largest
she
had
also
a
footstool
capital
good
soup
remarked
mr
quantock
ca
get
soup
like
this
at
home
there
was
dead
silence
why
was
there
never
a
silence
when
olga
was
there
wondered
georgie
it
was
because
she
talked
she
somehow
caused
other
people
to
talk
tommy
luton
has
got
measles
said
mrs
weston
i
always
said
he
had
though
there
are
measles
about
he
came
to
work
as
usual
this
morning
and
is
going
to
sing
in
the
carols
tonight
she
suddenly
stopped
georgie
gave
an
imploring
glance
at
foljambe
and
looked
at
the
champagne
glasses
she
took
no
notice
lucia
turned
to
georgie
with
an
elbow
on
the
table
between
her
and
mr
quantock
and
what
news
georgie
she
said
peppino
and
i
have
been
so
busy
that
we
have
seen
a
soul
all
day
what
have
you
been
doing
any
planchette
she
looked
brightly
at
mrs
quantock
yes
dear
daisy
i
need
ask
you
what
you
been
doing
i
expect
i
know
how
interested
you
are
in
psychical
matters
i
should
be
too
if
only
i
could
be
certain
that
i
was
not
dealing
with
fraudulent
people
georgie
felt
inclined
to
give
a
hollow
groan
and
sink
under
the
table
when
this
awful
polemical
rhetoric
began
to
his
unbounded
surprise
mrs
quantock
answered
most
cordially
you
are
quite
right
dear
lucia
she
said
would
it
not
be
terrible
to
find
that
a
medium
some
dear
friend
perhaps
whom
one
implicitly
trusted
was
exposed
as
fraudulent
one
sees
such
exposures
in
the
paper
sometimes
i
should
be
miserable
if
i
thought
i
had
ever
sat
with
a
medium
who
was
not
honest
they
fine
the
wretches
well
though
if
they
are
caught
and
they
deserve
it
georgie
observed
and
could
the
least
understand
a
sudden
blank
expression
cross
robert
face
for
the
moment
he
looked
as
if
he
were
dead
but
had
been
beautifully
stuffed
but
georgie
gave
but
a
cursory
thought
to
that
for
the
amazing
supposition
dawned
on
him
that
lucia
had
not
been
polemical
at
all
but
was
burying
instead
of
chopping
with
the
hatchet
it
was
instantly
confirmed
for
lucia
took
her
elbow
off
the
table
and
turned
to
robert
you
and
dear
daisy
have
been
very
lucky
in
your
spiritualistic
experiences
she
said
i
hear
on
all
sides
what
a
charming
medium
you
had
georgie
quite
lost
his
heart
to
her
my
word
she
was
delightful
said
robert
of
course
she
was
a
dear
friend
of
daisy
but
one
has
to
be
very
careful
when
one
hears
of
the
dreadful
exposures
as
my
wife
said
that
occur
sometimes
fancy
finding
that
a
medium
whom
you
believed
to
be
perfectly
honest
had
yards
and
yards
of
muslin
and
a
false
nose
or
two
concealed
about
her
it
would
sicken
me
of
the
whole
business
a
loud
pop
announced
that
foljambe
had
allowed
them
all
some
champagne
at
last
but
georgie
hardly
heard
it
for
glancing
up
at
daisy
quantock
he
observed
that
the
same
dead
and
stuffed
look
had
come
over
her
face
which
he
had
just
now
noticed
on
her
husband
countenance
then
they
both
looked
up
at
each
other
with
a
glance
that
to
him
bristled
with
significance
an
agonised
questioning
an
imploring
petition
for
silence
seemed
to
inspire
it
it
was
as
if
each
had
made
unwittingly
some
hopeless
then
they
instantly
looked
away
from
each
other
again
their
necks
seemed
to
crack
with
the
rapidity
with
which
they
turned
them
right
and
left
and
they
burst
into
torrents
of
speech
to
the
grey
hungry
mouse
and
the
colonel
respectively
georgie
was
utterly
mystified
his
riseholme
instinct
told
him
that
there
was
something
below
all
this
but
his
riseholme
instinct
could
not
supply
the
faintest
clue
as
to
what
it
was
both
of
the
quantocks
it
seemed
clear
knew
something
perilous
about
the
princess
but
surely
if
daisy
had
read
in
the
paper
that
the
princess
had
been
exposed
and
fined
she
would
not
have
touched
on
so
dangerous
a
subject
then
the
curious
incident
about
todd
news
inevitably
occurred
to
him
but
that
would
not
fit
the
case
since
it
was
robert
and
not
daisy
who
had
bought
that
inexplicable
number
of
the
yellow
print
and
then
robert
had
hinted
at
the
discovery
of
yards
and
yards
of
muslin
and
a
false
nose
why
had
he
done
that
unless
he
had
discovered
them
or
unless
georgie
eyes
grew
round
with
the
excitement
of
the
chase
unless
robert
had
some
other
reason
to
suspect
the
integrity
of
the
dear
friend
and
had
said
this
at
in
that
case
what
was
reason
for
suspicion
had
not
daisy
read
in
the
paper
of
some
damaging
disclosures
and
had
daisy
also
having
reason
to
suspect
the
princess
alluded
to
the
damaging
exposures
in
the
paper
by
pure
anyhow
they
had
both
looked
dead
and
stuffed
when
the
other
alluded
to
mediumistic
frauds
and
both
had
said
how
lucky
their
own
experiences
had
been
oh
georgie
almost
said
it
aloud
what
if
robert
had
seen
a
damaging
exposure
in
todd
news
and
therefore
bought
up
every
copy
that
was
to
be
had
then
indeed
he
would
look
dead
and
stuffed
when
daisy
alluded
to
damaging
exposures
in
the
paper
had
a
stray
copy
escaped
him
and
did
daisy
know
what
did
robert
know
had
they
exquisite
secrets
from
each
other
lucia
was
being
talked
to
across
him
by
mrs
weston
who
had
also
pinned
down
the
attention
of
peppino
on
the
other
side
of
her
at
that
precise
moment
the
flood
of
mrs
quantock
spate
of
conversation
to
the
colonel
dried
up
and
robert
could
find
nothing
more
to
say
to
the
hungry
mouse
georgie
in
this
backwater
of
his
own
thoughts
was
whirled
into
the
current
again
but
before
he
sank
he
caught
mrs
quantock
eye
and
put
a
question
that
arose
from
his
exciting
backwater
have
you
heard
from
the
princess
lately
he
asked
robert
head
went
round
with
the
same
alacrity
as
he
had
turned
it
away
oh
yes
said
she
two
days
ago
was
it
robert
i
heard
yesterday
said
robert
firmly
mrs
quantock
looked
at
her
husband
with
an
eager
encouraging
earnestness
so
you
did
she
said
i
getting
jealous
interesting
dear
yes
dear
haw
haw
said
robert
and
again
their
eyes
met
this
time
georgie
had
no
doubts
at
all
they
were
playing
the
same
game
now
they
smiled
and
smirked
at
each
other
they
had
not
been
playing
the
same
game
before
now
they
recognised
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
them
but
he
was
host
his
business
for
the
moment
was
to
make
his
guests
comfortable
and
not
pry
into
their
inmost
bosoms
so
before
mrs
weston
realised
that
she
had
the
whole
table
attending
to
her
he
said
i
shall
get
it
out
of
robert
after
dinner
and
i
tell
you
mrs
quantock
before
atkinson
came
to
the
colonel
said
mrs
weston
going
on
precisely
where
she
had
left
off
and
that
was
five
years
before
elizabeth
came
to
me
let
me
see
was
it
five
or
was
it
four
and
a
half
four
and
a
half
we
say
he
had
another
servant
whose
name
was
ahab
crowe
no
said
georgie
yes
said
mrs
weston
hastily
finishing
her
champagne
for
she
saw
foljambe
coming
near
yes
ahab
crowe
he
married
too
just
like
atkinson
is
going
to
and
that
an
odd
coincidence
in
itself
i
tell
the
colonel
that
if
ahab
crowe
had
married
he
would
be
with
him
still
and
who
can
say
that
he
have
fancied
elizabeth
and
if
he
had
i
do
believe
that
the
colonel
and
i
would
ever
have
well
i
leave
that
alone
and
spare
my
blushes
but
that
not
what
i
was
saying
whom
do
you
think
ahab
crowe
married
you
can
have
ten
guesses
each
and
you
would
never
come
right
for
it
ca
be
a
common
name
it
was
miss
jackdaw
crowe
jackdaw
i
never
heard
anything
like
that
and
if
you
ask
the
colonel
about
it
he
confirm
every
word
i
said
boucher
weston
why
that
quite
commonplace
in
comparison
and
sure
that
an
event
enough
for
me
lucia
gave
her
silvery
laugh
dear
mrs
weston
she
said
you
must
really
tell
me
at
once
when
the
happy
day
will
be
peppino
and
i
are
thinking
of
going
to
the
riviera
georgie
broke
in
you
sha
do
anything
of
the
kind
he
said
what
to
happen
to
us
very
selfish
lucia
the
conversation
broke
up
again
into
duets
and
trios
and
lucia
could
have
a
private
conversation
with
her
host
but
ago
so
georgie
reflected
they
had
all
been
walking
round
each
other
like
dogs
going
on
tiptoe
with
their
tails
very
tightly
curled
and
growling
gently
to
themselves
aware
that
a
hasty
snap
or
the
breach
of
the
smallest
observance
of
etiquette
might
lead
to
a
general
quarrel
but
now
they
all
had
the
reward
of
their
icy
politenesses
there
was
no
more
ice
except
on
their
plates
and
the
politeness
was
not
a
matter
of
etiquette
at
present
they
might
be
considered
a
republic
but
no
one
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
after
dinner
not
a
word
had
been
said
about
the
tableaux
lucia
dropped
her
voice
as
she
spoke
to
him
and
put
in
a
good
deal
of
italian
for
fear
she
might
be
overheard
anybody
she
asked
i
i
mean
and
are
we
all
to
sit
in
the
while
the
is
being
got
ready
said
georgie
there
a
fire
when
you
go
out
keep
them
there
i
are
making
ready
then
peppino
and
you
and
i
just
steal
away
is
acting
beautifully
we
tried
it
over
several
times
everybody
tummin
said
georgie
varying
the
cipher
me
so
said
lucia
fancy
me
doing
brunnhilde
before
singing
brunnhilde
me
ca
bear
it
georgie
knew
that
lucia
had
been
thrilled
and
delighted
to
know
that
olga
so
much
wanted
to
come
in
after
dinner
and
see
the
tableaux
so
he
found
it
quite
easy
to
induce
lucia
to
nerve
herself
up
to
an
ordeal
so
passionately
desired
indeed
he
himself
was
hardly
less
excited
at
the
thought
of
being
king
cophetua
at
that
moment
even
as
the
crackers
were
being
handed
round
the
sound
of
the
was
heard
from
outside
and
lucia
had
to
wince
as
good
king
wenceslas
looked
out
when
the
page
and
the
king
sang
their
speeches
the
other
voices
grew
piano
so
that
the
effect
was
of
a
solo
voice
accompanied
when
the
page
sang
lucia
shuddered
that
the
small
boy
who
nearly
deafens
me
in
church
she
whispered
to
georgie
do
you
hope
his
voice
will
crack
soon
she
said
this
very
discreetly
so
as
not
to
hurt
mrs
feelings
for
she
trained
the
choir
everyone
knew
that
the
king
was
mr
rumbold
and
said
charming
to
each
other
after
he
had
sung
i
liked
that
boy
voice
too
said
mrs
weston
tommy
luton
used
to
have
a
lovely
voice
but
this
one
struck
me
as
even
than
tommy
luton
great
credit
to
you
mrs
rumbold
the
grey
hungry
mouse
suddenly
gave
a
shrill
cackle
of
a
laugh
quite
inexplicable
then
georgie
guessed
he
got
up
now
nobody
must
move
he
said
because
we
have
drunk
friends
yet
i
just
going
out
to
see
that
they
have
a
bit
of
supper
in
the
kitchen
before
they
go
on
his
trembling
legs
would
scarcely
carry
him
to
the
door
and
he
ran
out
there
were
half
a
dozen
little
choir
boys
four
men
and
one
tall
cloaked
woman
divine
he
said
to
olga
aunt
jane
thought
your
voice
very
well
trained
come
in
soon
wo
you
yes
all
flourishing
swimming
said
georgie
lucia
hoped
your
voice
would
crack
soon
but
it
all
being
lovely
he
explained
about
food
in
the
kitchen
and
hurried
back
to
his
guests
there
was
the
riddle
of
the
quantocks
to
solve
there
were
the
tableaux
vivants
imminent
there
was
the
little
boy
coming
in
soon
what
a
christmas
night
soon
after
georgie
hall
began
to
fill
up
with
guests
and
yet
not
a
word
was
said
about
tableaux
it
grew
so
full
that
nobody
could
have
said
for
certain
whether
lucia
and
peppino
were
there
or
not
olga
certainly
was
there
was
no
mistaking
that
fact
and
then
foljambe
opened
the
door
and
sounded
a
gong
the
lamp
behaved
perfectly
and
an
hour
later
one
brunnhilde
was
being
extremely
kind
to
the
other
as
they
sat
together
if
you
really
want
to
know
my
view
dear
miss
bracely
said
lucia
it
just
that
you
must
be
brunnhilde
for
the
time
being
singing
of
course
as
you
say
helps
it
out
you
can
express
so
much
by
singing
you
are
so
lucky
there
i
am
bound
to
say
i
had
qualms
when
peppino
or
was
it
georgie
suggested
we
should
do
i
said
it
would
be
so
terribly
difficult
slow
it
has
to
be
slow
and
to
keep
gestures
slow
when
you
can
not
make
them
mere
illustrations
of
what
you
are
singing
well
i
am
sure
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
be
so
flattering
about
it
but
it
is
difficult
to
do
that
and
you
thought
them
all
out
for
yourself
said
olga
marvellous
ah
if
i
had
ever
seen
you
do
it
said
lucia
i
am
sure
i
should
have
picked
up
some
hints
and
king
cophetua
wo
you
give
me
a
little
word
for
our
dear
king
cophetua
i
was
so
glad
after
the
strain
of
brunnhilde
to
have
my
back
to
the
audience
even
then
there
is
the
difficulty
of
keeping
quite
still
but
i
am
sure
you
know
that
quite
as
well
as
i
do
from
having
played
brunnhilde
yourself
georgie
was
very
much
impressed
by
your
performance
of
it
and
mary
queen
of
scots
now
the
shrinking
of
the
flesh
and
the
resignation
of
the
spirit
that
is
what
i
tried
to
express
you
must
come
and
help
me
next
time
i
attempt
this
sort
of
thing
again
that
will
not
be
quite
soon
i
am
afraid
for
peppino
and
i
am
thinking
of
going
to
the
riviera
for
a
little
holiday
oh
but
how
selfish
said
olga
you
must
do
that
lucia
gave
the
silvery
laugh
you
are
all
very
tiresome
about
my
going
to
the
riviera
she
said
but
i
do
promise
that
i
shall
give
it
up
yet
we
shall
see
gracious
how
late
it
is
we
must
have
sat
very
late
over
dinner
why
were
you
not
asked
to
dinner
i
wonder
i
shall
scold
georgie
for
not
asking
you
ah
there
is
dear
mrs
weston
going
away
i
must
say
to
her
she
would
think
it
very
strange
if
i
did
not
colonel
boucher
too
oh
they
are
coming
this
way
to
save
us
the
trouble
of
moving
a
general
move
was
certainly
taking
place
not
in
the
direction
of
the
door
but
to
where
olga
and
lucia
were
sitting
it
snowing
said
piggy
excitedly
to
olga
will
you
mark
my
footsteps
well
my
page
piggy
you
you
goosie
said
olga
hurriedly
goosie
were
the
tableaux
lovely
and
the
carols
said
goosie
i
adored
the
carols
i
guessed
did
you
guess
mrs
lucas
olga
resorted
to
the
mean
trick
of
treading
on
goosie
foot
and
apologising
that
was
cowardly
because
it
was
sure
to
come
out
sometime
and
goosie
again
trod
on
dangerous
ground
by
saying
that
if
the
page
had
trod
like
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
footsteps
to
be
marked
for
him
it
was
snowing
fast
and
mrs
weston
wheels
left
a
deep
track
but
in
spite
of
that
daisy
and
robert
had
not
gone
fifty
yards
from
the
door
when
they
came
to
a
full
stop
now
what
is
it
said
daisy
out
with
it
why
did
you
talk
about
the
discovery
of
muslin
i
only
said
that
we
were
fortunate
in
a
medium
whom
after
all
you
picked
up
at
a
vegetarian
restaurant
said
he
i
suppose
i
may
indulge
in
general
conversation
if
it
comes
to
that
why
did
you
talk
about
exposure
in
the
papers
general
conversation
said
mrs
quantock
all
in
one
word
so
all
is
it
yes
said
robert
you
may
know
something
and
now
do
put
it
all
on
me
said
daisy
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
it
is
that
you
got
some
secret
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
he
retorted
it
is
that
i
know
you
have
daisy
hesitated
a
moment
the
snow
was
white
on
her
shoulder
and
she
shook
her
cloak
i
hate
concealment
she
said
i
found
yards
and
yards
of
muslin
and
a
pair
of
amadeo
eyebrows
in
that
woman
bedroom
the
very
day
she
went
away
and
she
was
fined
last
thursday
for
holding
a
seance
at
which
a
detective
was
present
said
robert
gerard
street
he
seized
amadeo
or
cardinal
newman
by
the
throat
and
it
was
that
woman
she
looked
hastily
round
when
you
thought
that
the
chimney
was
on
fire
i
was
burning
muslin
she
said
when
you
thought
the
chimney
was
on
fire
i
was
burning
every
copy
of
news
said
he
also
a
copy
of
the
mirror
which
contained
the
case
it
belonged
to
the
colonel
i
stole
it
she
put
her
hand
through
his
arm
let
get
home
she
said
we
must
talk
it
over
no
one
knows
one
word
except
you
and
me
not
one
my
dear
said
robert
cordially
but
there
are
suspicions
georgie
suspects
for
instance
he
saw
me
buy
all
the
copies
of
news
at
least
he
was
hanging
about
tonight
he
was
clearly
on
the
track
of
something
though
he
gave
us
a
very
tolerable
dinner
they
went
into
robert
study
it
was
cold
but
neither
felt
it
for
they
glowed
with
excitement
and
enterprise
that
was
a
wonderful
stroke
of
yours
robert
said
she
it
was
masterly
it
saved
the
situation
the
mirror
too
how
right
you
were
to
steal
it
a
horrid
paper
i
always
thought
yes
georgie
suspects
something
but
luckily
he
does
know
what
he
suspects
that
why
we
both
said
we
had
just
heard
from
that
woman
said
robert
of
course
you
have
got
a
copy
of
news
have
you
no
at
least
i
burned
every
page
of
the
police
reports
said
he
it
was
safer
quite
so
i
can
not
show
you
amadeo
eyebrows
for
the
same
reason
nor
the
muslin
lovely
muslin
my
dear
yards
of
it
now
what
we
must
do
is
this
we
must
continue
to
be
interested
in
psychical
things
we
drop
them
or
seem
to
be
put
off
them
i
wish
now
i
had
taken
you
into
my
confidence
at
the
beginning
and
told
you
about
amadeo
eyebrows
my
dear
you
acted
for
the
best
said
he
so
did
i
when
i
tell
you
about
news
secrecy
even
from
each
other
was
more
prudent
until
it
became
impossible
and
i
think
we
should
be
wise
to
let
it
be
understood
that
we
hear
from
the
princess
now
and
then
perhaps
in
a
few
months
she
might
even
visit
us
again
it
it
would
be
humorous
to
be
behind
the
scenes
so
to
speak
and
observe
the
credulity
of
the
others
daisy
broke
into
a
broad
grin
i
will
certainly
ask
dear
lucia
to
a
seance
if
we
do
she
said
dear
me
how
late
it
is
there
was
such
a
long
wait
between
the
tableaux
but
we
must
keep
our
eyes
on
georgie
and
be
careful
how
we
answer
his
impertinent
questions
he
is
sure
to
ask
some
about
getting
that
woman
down
again
robert
it
might
be
for
we
had
an
escape
and
should
put
our
heads
into
the
same
noose
again
on
the
other
hand
it
would
disarm
suspicion
for
ever
if
after
a
few
months
i
asked
her
to
spend
a
few
days
of
holiday
here
you
said
it
was
a
fine
only
not
imprisonment
the
week
was
a
busy
one
georgie
in
particular
never
had
a
moment
to
himself
the
hurst
so
lately
a
desert
suddenly
began
to
rejoice
with
joy
and
singing
and
broke
out
into
all
manner
of
edifying
gaieties
lucia
capricious
queen
quite
forgot
all
the
vitriolic
things
she
had
said
to
him
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
just
as
high
in
favour
as
ever
before
and
he
was
as
busy
with
his
duties
as
ever
he
had
been
whether
he
would
have
fallen
into
his
old
place
so
readily
if
he
had
been
a
free
agent
was
a
question
that
did
not
arise
for
though
it
was
lucia
who
employed
him
it
was
olga
who
drove
him
there
but
he
had
his
consolation
for
lucia
noble
forgiveness
of
all
the
disloyalties
against
her
included
olga
as
well
and
out
of
all
the
dinners
and
music
parties
and
recitations
from
peppino
new
book
of
prose
poems
which
was
already
in
proof
and
was
read
to
select
audiences
from
end
to
end
there
was
none
to
which
olga
was
not
bidden
and
none
at
which
she
failed
to
appear
lucia
even
overlooked
the
fact
that
she
had
sung
in
the
carols
on
christmas
night
though
she
had
herself
declared
that
it
was
the
voice
of
the
boy
which
was
so
peculiarly
painful
to
her
georgie
picture
of
her
she
never
knew
that
olga
had
really
commissioned
it
hung
at
the
side
of
the
piano
in
the
music
room
where
the
print
of
beethoven
had
hung
before
and
it
gave
her
the
acutest
gratification
it
represented
her
sitting
with
eyes
cast
down
at
her
piano
and
was
indeed
much
on
the
same
scheme
as
the
yet
unfinished
one
of
olga
which
had
been
postponed
in
its
favour
but
there
was
no
time
for
georgie
to
think
out
another
position
and
his
hand
was
in
with
regard
to
the
perspective
of
pianos
so
there
it
hung
with
its
title
the
moonlight
sonata
painted
in
gilt
letters
on
its
frame
and
lucia
though
she
continued
to
say
that
he
had
made
her
far
far
too
young
could
not
but
consider
that
he
had
caught
her
expression
exactly
so
riseholme
flocked
back
to
the
hurst
like
sheep
that
have
been
astray
for
it
was
certain
to
find
olga
there
even
as
it
had
turned
there
deeply
breathing
to
the
classes
of
the
guru
it
had
to
sit
through
the
of
peppino
it
had
to
listen
to
the
old
old
tunes
and
sigh
at
the
end
but
olga
mingled
her
sighs
with
theirs
and
often
after
a
suitable
pause
lucia
would
say
winningly
to
olga
one
little
song
miss
bracely
just
a
stanza
or
am
i
trespassing
too
much
on
your
where
is
your
accompanist
i
declare
i
am
jealous
of
him
i
shall
pop
into
his
place
some
day
georgino
miss
bracely
is
going
to
sing
us
something
is
not
that
a
treat
please
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
she
rustled
to
her
place
and
sat
with
the
expression
ever
seen
on
mortal
face
while
she
trespassed
on
miss
then
georgie
had
the
other
picture
to
finish
which
he
hoped
to
get
ready
in
time
to
be
a
new
year
present
since
olga
had
insisted
on
lucia
being
done
first
he
had
certainly
secured
an
admirable
likeness
of
her
and
there
was
in
it
just
all
that
his
stippled
fussy
representation
of
lucia
lacked
bleak
december
and
yellow
daffodils
and
the
rest
of
the
series
lacked
it
too
for
once
he
had
done
something
in
the
doing
of
which
he
had
forgotten
himself
it
was
by
no
means
a
work
of
genius
for
georgie
was
not
possessed
of
one
grain
of
that
and
the
talent
it
displayed
was
by
no
means
of
a
high
order
but
it
had
something
of
the
naturalness
of
a
flower
that
grew
from
the
earth
which
nourished
it
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
he
was
putting
a
few
final
touches
to
it
little
high
reflected
lights
on
the
black
keys
little
blacknesses
of
shadow
in
the
moulding
of
the
panel
behind
his
hand
he
had
finished
with
her
altogether
and
now
she
sat
in
the
looking
out
and
playing
with
the
he
had
been
so
much
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
had
scarcely
noticed
that
she
had
been
rather
unusually
silent
i
got
a
piece
of
news
for
you
she
said
at
length
georgie
held
his
breath
as
he
drew
a
very
thin
line
of
along
the
edge
of
ab
no
what
is
it
he
said
is
it
about
the
princess
olga
seemed
to
hail
this
as
a
diversion
ah
let
talk
about
that
for
a
minute
she
said
what
you
ought
to
have
done
was
to
order
another
copy
of
news
at
once
i
know
i
ought
but
i
could
get
one
when
i
thought
of
it
afterwards
that
was
tarsome
but
i
feel
sure
there
was
something
about
her
in
it
and
you
ca
get
anything
out
of
the
quantocks
no
though
i
laid
plenty
of
traps
for
them
there
an
understanding
between
them
now
they
both
know
something
when
i
lay
a
trap
it
is
any
use
they
look
at
the
trap
and
then
they
look
at
each
other
afterwards
what
sort
of
traps
oh
anything
i
say
suddenly
a
bore
it
is
that
there
are
so
many
frauds
among
mediums
especially
paid
ones
you
see
i
believe
for
a
moment
that
these
seances
were
held
for
nothing
though
we
did
pay
for
going
to
them
and
then
robert
says
that
he
would
never
trust
a
paid
medium
and
she
looks
at
him
approvingly
and
says
princess
the
other
day
it
was
a
very
good
trap
i
said
it
true
that
the
princess
is
coming
to
stay
with
lady
ambermere
it
was
a
lie
i
only
asked
and
then
said
olga
robert
gave
an
awful
twitch
not
a
jump
exactly
but
a
twitch
but
she
was
on
the
spot
and
said
that
would
be
nice
i
wonder
if
true
the
princess
did
mention
it
in
her
last
letter
and
then
he
looked
at
her
approvingly
there
is
something
there
no
one
shall
convince
me
otherwise
olga
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
what
the
matter
asked
georgie
oh
it
all
so
delicious
she
said
i
never
knew
before
how
terribly
interesting
little
things
were
it
all
wildly
exciting
and
there
are
fifty
things
going
on
just
as
exciting
is
it
all
of
you
who
take
such
a
tremendous
interest
in
them
that
makes
them
so
absorbing
or
is
it
that
they
are
absorbing
in
themselves
and
ordinary
dull
people
not
riseholmites
do
see
how
exciting
they
are
tommy
luton
measles
the
quantocks
secret
elizabeth
lover
and
to
think
that
i
believed
i
was
coming
to
a
backwater
georgie
held
up
his
picture
and
half
closed
his
eyes
i
believe
finished
he
said
i
shall
have
it
framed
and
put
it
in
my
this
was
a
trap
and
olga
fell
into
it
yes
it
will
look
nice
there
she
said
really
georgie
it
is
very
clever
of
you
he
began
washing
his
brushes
and
what
was
your
news
he
said
she
got
up
from
her
seat
i
forgot
all
about
it
with
talking
of
the
quantocks
secret
she
said
that
just
shows
you
i
completely
forgot
georgie
i
just
accepted
an
offer
to
sing
in
america
a
four
months
engagement
at
fifty
thousand
million
pounds
a
night
a
penny
less
and
i
have
gone
but
i
really
ca
refuse
it
all
been
very
sudden
but
they
want
to
produce
lucretia
there
before
it
appears
in
england
then
i
come
back
and
sing
in
london
all
the
summer
oh
me
there
was
dead
silence
while
georgie
dried
his
brushes
when
do
you
go
he
asked
in
about
a
fortnight
oh
said
he
she
moved
down
the
room
to
the
piano
and
shut
it
without
speaking
while
he
folded
the
paper
round
his
finished
picture
why
do
you
come
too
she
said
at
length
it
would
do
you
no
end
of
good
for
you
would
get
out
of
this
darling
place
which
will
all
go
inside
a
there
are
big
things
in
the
world
georgie
seas
continents
people
movements
emotions
i
told
my
georgie
i
was
going
to
ask
you
and
he
thoroughly
approves
we
both
like
you
you
know
it
would
be
lovely
if
you
would
come
come
for
a
couple
of
months
anyhow
of
course
you
be
our
guest
please
the
world
at
that
moment
had
grown
absolutely
black
to
him
and
it
was
by
that
that
he
knew
who
for
him
was
the
light
of
it
he
shook
his
head
why
ca
you
come
she
said
he
looked
at
her
straight
in
the
face
because
i
adore
you
he
said
chapter
sixteen
the
glad
word
went
round
riseholme
one
march
morning
that
the
earliest
flower
in
perdita
garden
was
in
bloom
the
day
was
one
of
those
glories
of
the
english
with
large
white
clouds
blown
across
wide
spaces
of
blue
sky
by
the
southwest
wind
and
with
swift
shadows
that
bowled
across
the
green
below
them
parliament
was
in
full
conclave
that
day
and
in
the
elms
the
rooks
were
busy
an
awful
flatness
had
succeeded
olga
departure
riseholme
naturally
took
a
good
deal
of
credit
for
the
tremendous
success
which
had
attended
the
production
of
lucretia
since
it
so
rightly
considered
that
the
real
cradle
of
the
opera
was
here
where
she
had
tried
it
over
for
the
first
time
lucia
seemed
to
remember
it
better
than
anybody
for
she
remembered
all
sorts
of
things
which
no
one
else
had
the
faintest
recollection
of
how
she
had
discussed
music
with
signor
cortese
and
he
had
asked
her
where
she
had
her
musical
training
such
a
treat
to
talk
italian
with
a
roman
lingua
toscana
in
bocca
romana
and
what
a
wonderful
evening
it
was
poor
mrs
colonel
recollected
very
little
of
this
but
lucia
had
long
been
aware
that
her
memory
was
going
sadly
after
producing
lucretia
in
new
york
olga
had
appeared
in
some
of
her
old
roles
notably
in
the
part
of
brunnhilde
and
lucia
was
very
reminiscent
of
that
charming
party
of
christmas
day
at
dear
georgino
when
they
had
the
tableaux
dear
olga
was
so
simple
and
unspoiled
she
had
come
to
lucia
afterwards
and
asked
her
to
tell
her
how
she
had
worked
out
her
scheme
of
gestures
in
the
awakening
and
lucia
had
been
very
glad
very
glad
indeed
to
give
her
a
few
hints
in
fact
lucia
was
quite
herself
it
was
only
her
subjects
whom
it
had
been
a
little
hard
to
stir
up
georgie
in
particular
had
been
very
listless
and
dull
and
lucia
for
all
her
ingenuity
was
at
a
complete
loss
to
find
a
reason
for
it
but
today
the
warm
inflowing
tide
of
spring
seemed
to
renovate
the
muddy
flats
setting
the
weeds
that
had
lain
dank
and
dispirited
again
on
the
return
of
the
water
no
one
could
quite
resist
the
magic
of
the
season
and
georgie
who
had
intended
out
of
mere
politeness
to
go
to
see
the
earliest
of
perdita
stupid
flowers
having
been
warned
of
its
epiphany
by
telephone
from
the
hurst
found
when
he
set
foot
outside
his
house
on
that
warm
windy
morning
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
stroll
across
the
green
first
and
see
if
there
was
any
news
all
the
news
he
had
really
cared
about
for
the
last
two
months
was
news
from
america
of
which
he
had
a
small
packet
done
up
in
a
pink
riband
after
getting
rid
of
piggy
he
went
to
the
newspaper
shop
to
get
his
times
which
most
unaccountably
had
not
arrived
and
the
sight
of
todd
news
in
its
yellow
cover
stirred
his
drowsy
interest
not
one
atom
of
light
had
ever
been
thrown
on
that
extraordinary
occurrence
when
robert
bought
the
whole
issue
and
though
olga
never
failed
to
enquire
he
had
not
been
able
to
give
her
the
slightest
additional
information
occasionally
he
set
a
languid
trap
for
one
of
the
quantocks
but
they
never
by
any
chance
fell
into
it
the
whole
affair
must
be
classed
with
problems
like
the
origin
of
evil
among
the
insoluble
mysteries
of
life
it
was
possible
to
get
letters
by
the
second
post
an
hour
earlier
than
the
delivery
by
calling
at
the
office
and
as
georgie
was
waiting
for
his
times
mrs
quantock
came
hurrying
out
of
the
with
a
small
packet
in
her
hands
which
she
was
opening
as
she
walked
she
was
so
much
absorbed
by
this
that
she
did
not
see
georgie
at
all
though
she
passed
quite
close
to
him
and
soon
after
shed
a
registered
envelope
at
that
the
old
familiar
glamour
began
to
steal
over
him
again
and
he
found
himself
wondering
with
intensity
what
it
contained
she
was
now
some
hundred
yards
in
front
of
him
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
hurst
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
too
was
on
her
way
to
see
perdita
first
flower
he
followed
her
going
more
briskly
than
she
and
began
to
catch
her
up
soon
this
time
by
accident
not
in
the
manner
in
which
through
eagerness
she
had
untidily
cast
the
registered
envelope
away
she
dropped
a
small
paper
and
georgie
picked
it
up
meaning
to
give
it
her
it
had
printed
matter
on
the
front
of
it
and
was
clearly
a
small
pamphlet
he
could
not
possibly
help
seeing
what
that
printed
matter
was
for
it
was
in
capital
letters
increase
your
height
georgie
quickened
his
step
and
the
old
familiar
glamour
brightened
round
him
as
soon
as
he
got
within
speaking
distance
he
called
to
her
and
turning
round
like
a
guilty
thing
surprised
a
little
box
flew
out
of
her
hand
as
it
fell
the
lid
came
off
and
there
was
scattered
on
the
green
grass
a
multitude
of
red
lozenges
she
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
oh
mr
georgie
how
you
startled
me
she
said
do
help
me
to
pick
them
up
do
you
think
the
damp
will
have
hurt
them
any
news
i
was
so
wrapped
up
in
what
i
was
doing
that
i
spoken
to
nobody
georgie
assisted
in
the
recovery
of
the
red
lozenges
you
dropped
this
as
you
walked
he
said
i
picked
it
up
in
order
to
give
it
you
ah
that
is
kind
and
did
you
see
what
it
was
i
could
help
seeing
the
outside
said
georgie
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
wondering
what
was
the
most
prudent
course
if
she
said
nothing
more
he
would
probably
tell
everybody
well
then
i
shall
let
you
into
the
whole
secret
she
said
it
the
most
wonderful
invention
and
increases
your
height
whatever
your
age
is
from
two
to
six
inches
fancy
there
are
some
exercises
you
have
to
do
rather
like
those
yoga
ones
every
morning
and
you
eat
three
lozenges
a
day
quite
harmless
they
are
and
then
you
soon
begin
to
shoot
up
it
sounds
incredible
does
it
but
there
are
so
many
testimonials
that
i
ca
doubt
it
is
genuine
here
one
of
a
man
who
grew
six
inches
i
saw
it
advertised
in
some
paper
and
sent
for
it
only
a
guinea
what
fun
when
robert
begins
to
see
that
i
am
taller
than
he
is
but
now
not
a
word
do
tell
dear
lucia
whatever
you
do
she
is
half
a
head
taller
than
i
and
it
would
be
no
fun
if
everybody
grew
from
two
to
six
inches
you
may
write
for
them
and
i
give
you
the
address
but
you
must
tell
nobody
too
wonderful
said
georgie
i
watch
you
here
we
are
look
there
perdita
flower
what
a
beauty
it
was
not
necessary
to
press
the
mermaid
tail
for
lucia
had
seen
them
from
the
and
they
heard
her
high
heels
clacking
over
the
polished
floor
of
the
hall
listen
no
more
need
of
high
heels
said
mrs
quantock
and
i
got
something
else
to
tell
you
lucia
may
hear
that
ah
dear
lucia
what
a
wonderful
is
it
not
said
lucia
blowing
kisses
to
georgie
and
giving
them
to
daisy
that
shows
spring
is
here
and
comes
out
today
i
should
not
be
a
bit
surprised
if
you
each
of
you
found
a
copy
of
it
arrived
before
evening
glorious
it
glorious
surely
it
was
no
wonder
that
georgie
blood
began
to
canter
along
his
arteries
again
there
had
been
very
pleasant
exciting
years
before
now
requiring
for
their
fuel
no
more
than
was
ready
at
this
moment
to
keep
up
the
fire
mrs
quantock
was
on
so
to
speak
to
increase
her
height
peppino
was
just
delivered
of
a
second
of
these
vellum
volumes
with
seals
and
tapes
outside
mrs
weston
was
going
to
become
mrs
colonel
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
at
the
same
hour
and
church
elizabeth
was
going
to
become
mrs
atkinson
had
these
things
no
savour
because
how
is
said
georgie
with
a
sudden
flush
of
the
through
him
me
vewy
well
sank
and
me
so
want
to
read
come
in
said
lucia
evewybody
come
in
now
who
got
ickle
bit
news
mrs
quantock
had
been
walking
on
her
toes
all
across
the
hall
in
anticipation
of
the
happy
time
when
she
would
be
from
two
to
six
inches
taller
as
the
animated
pamphlet
said
the
world
assumed
a
totally
different
aspect
when
you
were
even
two
inches
taller
she
was
quite
sorry
to
sit
down
is
next
week
very
full
with
you
dear
lucia
she
asked
lucia
pressed
her
finger
to
her
forehead
monday
tuesday
wednesday
she
began
no
not
tuesday
i
am
doing
nothing
on
tuesday
you
want
to
be
the
death
of
me
between
you
why
i
hope
that
my
dear
friend
princess
popoffski
will
be
staying
with
me
said
mrs
quantock
do
get
over
your
prejudice
against
spiritualism
and
give
it
a
chance
come
to
a
seance
on
tuesday
you
too
of
course
georgie
i
know
better
than
to
invite
lucia
without
you
lucia
put
on
the
look
which
she
reserved
for
the
masterpieces
of
music
and
for
georgie
hopeless
devotion
lovely
that
will
be
lovely
she
said
most
interesting
i
shall
come
with
a
perfectly
open
mind
georgie
scarcely
lamented
the
annihilation
of
a
mystery
he
must
surely
have
imagined
the
mystery
for
it
all
collapsed
like
a
if
the
princess
was
coming
back
the
seances
had
been
most
remarkable
too
and
he
would
have
to
get
out
his
planchette
again
and
what
going
to
happen
on
wednesday
he
asked
lucia
all
i
know
is
that
i
not
been
asked
me
offended
ickle
surprise
said
lucia
you
not
engaged
that
evening
are
you
nor
you
dear
daisy
that
lovely
eight
no
i
think
a
quarter
to
that
will
give
us
more
time
i
sha
tell
you
what
it
is
mrs
quantock
grasping
her
lozenges
wondered
how
much
taller
she
would
be
by
then
as
lucia
played
to
them
she
drew
a
lozenge
out
of
the
box
and
put
it
into
her
mouth
in
order
to
begin
growing
at
once
it
tasted
rather
bitter
but
not
unpleasantly
so
