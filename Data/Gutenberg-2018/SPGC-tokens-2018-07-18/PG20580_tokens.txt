december
on
thursday
december
the
constituent
assembly
being
in
session
surrounded
at
that
moment
by
an
imposing
display
of
troops
heard
the
report
of
the
representative
read
on
behalf
of
the
committee
which
had
been
appointed
to
scrutinize
the
votes
in
the
election
of
president
of
the
republic
a
report
in
which
general
attention
had
marked
this
phrase
which
embodied
its
whole
idea
it
is
the
seal
of
its
inviolable
authority
which
the
nation
by
this
admirable
application
of
the
fundamental
law
itself
affixes
on
the
constitution
to
render
it
sacred
and
inviolable
amid
the
profound
silence
of
the
nine
hundred
representatives
of
whom
almost
the
entire
number
was
assembled
the
president
of
the
national
constituent
assembly
armaud
marrast
rose
and
said
in
the
name
of
the
french
people
whereas
citizen
bonaparte
born
at
paris
fulfils
the
conditions
of
eligibility
prescribed
by
article
of
the
constitution
whereas
in
the
ballot
cast
throughout
the
extent
of
the
territory
of
the
republic
for
the
election
of
president
he
has
received
an
absolute
majority
of
votes
by
virtue
of
articles
and
of
the
constitution
the
national
assembly
proclaims
him
president
of
the
republic
from
this
present
day
until
the
second
sunday
in
may
there
was
a
general
movement
on
all
the
benches
and
in
the
galleries
filled
with
the
public
the
president
of
the
constituent
assembly
added
according
to
the
terms
of
the
decree
i
invite
the
citizen
president
of
the
republic
to
ascend
the
tribune
and
to
take
the
oath
the
representatives
who
crowded
the
right
lobby
returned
to
their
places
and
left
the
passage
free
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
immense
hall
of
the
assembly
having
become
involved
in
gloom
the
chandeliers
were
lowered
from
the
ceiling
and
the
messengers
placed
lamps
on
the
tribune
the
president
made
a
sign
the
door
on
the
right
opened
and
there
was
seen
to
enter
the
hall
and
rapidly
ascend
the
tribune
a
man
still
young
attired
in
black
having
on
his
breast
the
badge
and
riband
of
the
legion
of
honour
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
this
man
a
pallid
face
its
bony
emaciated
angles
thrown
into
bold
relief
by
the
shaded
lamps
a
nose
large
and
long
moustaches
a
curled
lock
of
hair
above
a
narrow
forehead
eyes
small
and
dull
and
with
a
timid
and
uneasy
manner
bearing
no
resemblance
to
the
emperor
this
man
was
citizen
bonaparte
during
the
murmurs
which
greeted
his
entrance
he
remained
for
some
instants
his
right
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
buttoned
coat
erect
and
motionless
on
the
tribune
the
pediment
of
which
bore
these
dates
february
and
above
which
were
inscribed
these
three
words
before
being
elected
president
of
the
republic
bonaparte
had
been
a
representative
of
the
people
for
several
months
and
though
he
had
rarely
attended
a
whole
sitting
he
had
been
frequently
seen
in
the
seat
he
had
selected
on
the
upper
benches
of
the
left
in
the
fifth
row
in
the
zone
commonly
called
the
mountain
behind
his
old
preceptor
representative
vieillard
this
man
then
was
no
new
figure
in
the
assembly
yet
his
entrance
on
this
occasion
produced
a
profound
sensation
it
was
to
all
to
his
friends
as
to
his
foes
the
future
that
entered
an
unknown
future
amid
the
immense
murmur
produced
by
the
whispered
words
of
all
present
his
name
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
coupled
with
most
diverse
opinions
his
antagonists
detailed
his
adventures
his
strasburg
boulogne
the
tame
eagle
and
the
piece
of
meat
in
the
little
hat
his
friends
dwelt
upon
his
exile
his
proscription
his
imprisonment
an
excellent
work
of
his
on
the
artillery
his
writings
at
ham
which
were
marked
to
a
certain
degree
with
the
liberal
democratic
and
socialistic
spirit
the
maturity
of
the
more
sober
age
at
which
he
had
now
arrived
and
to
those
who
recalled
his
follies
they
recalled
his
misfortunes
general
cavaignac
who
not
having
been
elected
president
had
just
resigned
his
power
into
the
hands
of
the
assembly
with
that
tranquil
laconism
which
befits
republics
was
seated
in
his
customary
place
at
the
head
of
the
ministerial
bench
on
the
left
of
the
tribune
and
observed
in
silence
with
folded
arms
this
installation
of
the
new
man
at
length
silence
was
restored
the
president
of
the
assembly
struck
the
table
before
him
several
times
with
his
wooden
knife
and
then
the
last
murmurs
having
subsided
said
i
will
now
read
the
form
of
the
oath
there
was
something
almost
religious
about
that
moment
the
assembly
was
no
longer
an
assembly
it
was
a
temple
the
immense
significance
of
the
oath
was
rendered
still
more
impressive
by
the
circumstance
that
it
was
the
only
oath
taken
throughout
the
whole
territory
of
the
republic
february
had
and
rightly
abolished
the
political
oath
and
the
constitution
had
as
rightly
retained
only
the
oath
of
the
president
this
oath
possessed
the
double
character
of
necessity
and
of
grandeur
it
was
an
oath
taken
by
the
executive
the
subordinate
power
to
the
legislative
the
superior
power
it
was
even
more
than
this
in
contrast
to
the
monarchical
fiction
by
which
the
people
take
the
oath
to
the
man
invested
with
power
it
was
the
man
invested
with
power
who
took
the
oath
to
the
people
the
president
functionary
and
servant
swore
fidelity
to
the
sovereign
people
bending
before
the
national
majesty
manifest
in
the
omnipotent
assembly
he
received
from
the
assembly
the
constitution
and
swore
obedience
to
it
the
representatives
were
inviolable
and
he
was
not
we
repeat
it
a
citizen
responsible
to
all
the
citizens
he
was
of
the
whole
nation
the
only
man
so
bound
hence
in
this
oath
sole
and
supreme
there
was
a
solemnity
which
went
to
the
heart
he
who
writes
these
lines
was
present
in
his
place
in
the
assembly
on
the
day
this
oath
was
taken
he
is
one
of
those
who
in
the
face
of
the
civilized
world
called
to
bear
witness
received
this
oath
in
the
name
of
the
people
and
who
have
it
still
in
their
hands
thus
it
runs
in
presence
of
god
and
before
the
french
people
represented
by
the
national
assembly
i
swear
to
remain
faithful
to
the
democratic
republic
one
and
indivisible
and
to
fulfil
all
the
duties
imposed
upon
me
by
the
constitution
the
president
of
the
assembly
standing
read
this
majestic
formula
then
before
the
whole
assembly
breathlessly
silent
and
attentive
intensely
expectant
citizen
bonaparte
raising
his
right
hand
said
in
a
firm
loud
voice
i
swear
it
representative
boulay
de
la
meurthe
since
of
the
republic
who
had
known
bonaparte
from
his
childhood
exclaimed
he
is
an
honest
man
he
will
keep
his
oath
the
president
of
the
assembly
still
standing
proceeded
thus
i
quote
the
words
recorded
in
the
we
call
god
and
man
to
witness
the
oath
which
has
just
been
sworn
the
national
assembly
receives
that
oath
orders
it
to
be
transcribed
upon
its
records
printed
in
the
and
published
in
the
same
manner
as
legislative
acts
it
seemed
that
the
ceremony
was
now
at
an
end
and
we
imagined
that
citizen
bonaparte
thenceforth
until
the
second
sunday
in
may
president
of
the
republic
would
descend
from
the
tribune
but
he
did
not
he
felt
a
magnanimous
impulse
to
bind
himself
still
more
rigorously
if
possible
to
add
something
to
the
oath
which
the
constitution
demanded
from
him
in
order
to
show
how
largely
the
oath
was
free
and
spontaneous
he
asked
permission
to
address
the
assembly
you
have
the
floor
said
the
president
of
the
assembly
there
was
more
profound
silence
and
closer
attention
than
before
citizen
bonaparte
unfolded
a
paper
and
read
a
speech
in
this
speech
having
announced
and
installed
the
ministry
appointed
by
him
he
said
i
desire
in
common
with
yourselves
citizen
representatives
to
consolidate
society
upon
its
true
basis
to
establish
democratic
institutions
and
earnestly
to
seek
every
means
calculated
to
relieve
the
sufferings
of
the
generous
and
intelligent
people
who
have
just
bestowed
on
me
so
signal
a
proof
of
their
confidence
hear
hear
he
then
thanked
his
predecessor
in
the
executive
power
the
same
man
who
later
was
able
to
say
these
noble
words
did
not
fall
from
power
i
descended
from
and
he
glorified
him
in
these
terms
the
new
administration
in
entering
upon
its
duties
is
bound
to
thank
that
which
preceded
it
for
the
efforts
it
has
made
to
transmit
the
executive
power
intact
and
to
maintain
public
tranquillity
murmurs
of
the
conduct
of
the
honourable
general
cavaignac
has
been
worthy
of
the
manliness
of
his
character
and
of
that
sentiment
of
duty
which
is
the
first
quality
requisite
in
the
chief
of
the
state
renewed
murmurs
of
the
assembly
cheered
these
words
but
that
which
especially
struck
every
mind
which
was
profoundly
graven
in
every
memory
which
found
its
echo
in
every
honest
heart
was
the
declaration
the
wholly
spontaneous
declaration
we
repeat
with
which
he
began
his
address
the
suffrages
of
the
nation
and
the
oath
i
have
just
taken
command
my
future
conduct
my
duty
is
clearly
marked
i
will
fulfil
it
as
a
man
of
honour
i
shall
regard
as
the
enemies
of
the
country
all
who
seek
to
change
by
illegal
means
that
which
all
france
has
established
when
he
had
done
speaking
the
constituent
assembly
rose
and
uttered
as
with
a
single
voice
the
exclamation
long
live
the
republic
bonaparte
descended
from
the
tribune
went
up
to
general
cavaignac
and
offered
him
his
hand
the
general
for
a
few
instants
hesitated
to
accept
the
grasp
all
who
had
just
heard
the
words
of
louis
bonaparte
pronounced
in
a
tone
so
instinct
with
good
faith
blamed
the
general
for
his
hesitation
the
constitution
to
which
bonaparte
took
oath
on
december
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
contained
among
other
articles
these

by
which
the
president
of
the
republic
dissolves
the
national
assembly
prorogues
it
or
impedes
the
execution

its
decrees
is
high
treason
by
such
act
of
itself
the
president
forfeits
his
office
the
citizens
are
bound
to
refuse
him
obedience
and
the
executive

years
after

memorable
day
on

at
daybreak
there
might
be
read
on

bonaparte
at
the
same
time
paris
learned
that
fifteen
of
the
inviolable
representatives
of
the
people
had
been
arrested
in
their
homes
during
the
night
by
order
of
bonaparte
ii
mission
of
the
representatives
those
who
as
representatives
of
the
people
received
in
trust
for
the
people
the
oath
of
the
of
december
those
especially
who
being
twice
invested
with
the
confidence
of
the
nation
had
as
representatives
heard
that
oath
sworn
and
as
legislators
had
seen
it
violated
had
assumed
with
their
writ
of
summons
two
duties
the
first
of
these
was
on
the
day
when
that
oath
should
be
violated
to
rise
in
their
places
to
present
their
breasts
to
the
enemy
without
calculating
either
his
numbers
or
his
strength
to
shelter
with
their
bodies
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
as
a
means
to
combat
and
cast
down
the
usurper
to
grasp
every
sort
of
weapon
from
the
law
found
in
the
code
to
the
paving
stone
that
one
picks
up
in
the
street
the
second
duty
was
after
having
accepted
the
combat
and
all
its
chances
to
accept
proscription
and
all
its
miseries
to
stand
eternally
erect
before
the
traitor
his
oath
in
their
hands
to
forget
their
personal
sufferings
their
private
sorrows
their
families
dispersed
and
maltreated
their
fortunes
destroyed
their
affections
crushed
their
bleeding
hearts
to
forget
themselves
and
to
feel
thenceforth
but
a
single
wound
the
wound
of
france
to
cry
aloud
for
justice
never
to
suffer
themselves
to
be
appeased
never
to
relent
but
to
be
implacable
to
seize
the
despicable
perjurer
crowned
though
he
were
if
not
with
the
hand
of
the
law
at
least
with
the
pincers
of
truth
and
to
heat
in
the
fire
of
history
all
the
letters
of
his
oath
and
brand
them
on
his
face
he
who
writes
these
lines
is
one
of
those
who
did
not
shrink
on
the
of
december
from
the
utmost
effort
to
accomplish
the
first
of
these
two
great
duties
in
publishing
this
book
he
performs
the
second
iii
notice
of
expiration
of
term
it
is
time
that
the
human
conscience
should
awaken
ever
since
the
of
december
a
successful
ambush
a
crime
odious
repulsive
infamous
unprecedented
considering
the
age
in
which
it
was
committed
has
triumphed
and
held
sway
erecting
itself
into
a
theory
pluming
itself
in
the
sunlight
making
laws
issuing
decrees
taking
society
religion
and
the
family
under
its
protection
holding
out
its
hand
to
the
kings
of
europe
who
accept
it
and
calling
them
my
brother
or
my
cousin
this
crime
no
one
disputes
not
even
those
who
profit
by
it
and
live
by
it
they
say
simply
that
it
was
necessary
not
even
he
who
committed
it
who
says
merely
that
he
the
criminal
has
been
absolved
this
crime
contains
within
itself
all
crimes
treachery
in
the
conception
perjury
in
the
execution
murder
and
assassination
in
the
struggle
spoliation
swindling
and
robbery
in
the
triumph
this
crime
draws
after
it
as
integral
parts
of
itself
suppression
of
the
laws
violation
of
constitutional
inviolabilities
arbitrary
sequestration
confiscation
of
property
midnight
massacres
secret
military
executions
commissions
superseding
tribunals
ten
thousand
citizens
banished
forty
thousand
citizens
proscribed
sixty
thousand
families
ruined
and
despairing
these
things
are
patent
even
so
it
is
painful
to
say
it
but
there
is
silence
concerning
this
crime
it
is
there
men
see
it
touch
it
and
pass
on
to
their
business
shops
are
opened
the
stock
jobbers
job
commerce
seated
on
her
packages
rubs
her
hands
and
the
moment
is
close
at
hand
when
everybody
will
regard
all
that
has
taken
place
as
a
matter
of
course
he
who
measures
cloth
does
not
hear
the
in
his
hand
speak
to
him
and
say
is
a
false
measure
that
governs
he
who
weighs
out
a
commodity
does
not
hear
his
scales
raise
their
voice
and
say
is
a
false
weight
that
reigns
a
strange
order
of
things
surely
that
has
for
its
base
supreme
disorder
the
negation
of
all
law
equilibrium
resting
on
iniquity
let
us
add
what
for
that
matter
is
that
the
author
of
this
crime
is
a
malefactor
of
the
most
cynical
and
lowest
description
at
this
moment
let
all
who
wear
a
robe
a
scarf
or
a
uniform
let
all
those
who
serve
this
man
know
if
they
think
themselves
the
agents
of
a
power
that
they
deceive
themselves
they
are
the
shipmates
of
a
pirate
ever
since
the
of
december
there
have
been
no
in
france
there
have
been
only
accomplices
the
moment
has
come
when
every
one
must
take
careful
account
of
what
he
has
done
of
what
he
is
continuing
to
do
the
gendarmes
who
arrested
those
whom
the
man
of
strasburg
and
boulogne
called
insurgents
arrested
the
guardians
of
the
constitution
the
judge
who
tried
the
combatants
of
paris
or
the
provinces
placed
in
the
dock
the
mainstays
of
the
law
the
officer
who
confined
in
the
hulks
the
condemned
men
confined
the
defenders
of
the
republic
and
of
the
state
the
general
in
africa
who
imprisoned
at
lambassa
the
transported
men
bending
beneath
the
fierce
heat
shivering
with
fever
digging
in
the
soil
a
furrow
destined
to
be
their
grave
that
general
sequestrated
tortured
assassinated
the
men
of
the
law
all
generals
officers
gendarmes
judges
are
absolutely
under
forfeiture
they
have
before
them
more
than
innocent
men
heroes
more
than
victims
martyrs
let
them
know
this
therefore
and
let
them
hasten
to
act
upon
the
knowledge
let
them
at
least
break
the
fetters
draw
the
bolts
empty
the
hulks
throw
open
the
jails
since
they
have
not
still
the
courage
to
grasp
the
sword
up
consciences
awake
it
is
full
time
if
law
right
duty
reason
common
sense
equity
justice
suffice
not
let
them
think
of
the
future
if
remorse
is
mute
let
responsibility
speak
and
let
all
those
who
being
landed
proprietors
shake
the
magistrate
by
the
hand
who
being
bankers
f√™te
a
general
who
being
peasants
salute
a
gendarme
let
all
those
who
do
not
shun
the
h√¥tel
in
which
dwells
the
minister
the
house
in
which
dwells
the
prefect
as
he
would
shun
a
let
all
those
who
being
simple
citizens
not
functionaries
go
to
the
balls
and
the
banquets
of
louis
bonaparte
and
see
not
that
the
black
flag
waves
over
the
√©lys√©e
let
all
these
in
like
manner
know
that
this
sort
of
shame
is
contagious
if
they
avoid
material
complicity
they
will
not
avoid
moral
complicity
the
crime
of
the
of
december
bespatters
them
the
present
situation
that
seems
so
calm
to
the
unthinking
is
most
threatening
be
sure
of
that
when
public
morality
is
under
eclipse
an
appalling
shadow
settles
down
upon
social
order
all
guarantees
take
wing
all
supports
vanish
thenceforth
there
is
not
in
france
a
tribunal
nor
a
court
nor
a
judge
to
render
justice
and
pronounce
a
sentence
on
any
subject
against
any
one
in
the
name
of
any
one
bring
before
the
assizes
a
malefactor
of
any
sort
the
thief
will
say
to
the
judges
the
chief
of
the
state
robbed
the
bank
of
millions
the
false
witness
will
say
to
the
judges
the
chief
of
the
state
took
an
oath
in
the
face
of
god
and
of
man
and
that
oath
he
has
violated
the
sequestrator
will
say
the
chief
of
the
state
has
arrested
and
detained
against
all
law
the
representatives
of
the
sovereign
people
the
swindler
will
say
the
chief
of
the
state
got
his
election
got
power
got
the
tuileries
all
by
swindling
the
forger
will
say
the
chief
of
the
state
forged
votes
the
footpad
will
say
the
chief
of
the
state
stole
their
purses
from
the
princes
of
orleans
the
murderer
will
say
the
chief
of
the
state
shot
sabred
bayonetted
massacred
passengers
in
the
streets
and
all
together
swindler
forger
false
witness
footpad
robber
assassin
will
add
and
you
judges
you
have
been
to
salute
this
man
to
praise
him
for
having
perjured
himself
to
compliment
him
for
committing
forgery
to
praise
him
for
stealing
and
swindling
to
thank
him
for
murdering
what
do
you
want
of
us
assuredly
this
is
a
very
serious
state
of
things
to
sleep
in
such
a
situation
is
additional
ignominy
it
is
time
we
repeat
that
this
monstrous
slumber
of
men
consciences
should
end
it
must
not
be
after
that
fearful
scandal
the
triumph
of
crime
that
a
scandal
still
more
fearful
should
be
presented
to
mankind
the
indifference
of
the
civilized
world
if
that
were
to
be
history
would
appear
one
day
as
an
avenger
and
from
this
very
hour
as
the
wounded
lion
takes
refuge
in
the
solitudes
the
just
man
veiling
his
face
in
presence
of
this
universal
degradation
would
take
refuge
in
the
immensity
of
public
contempt
iv
men
will
awaken
but
it
is
not
to
be
men
will
awaken
the
present
book
has
for
its
sole
aim
to
arouse
the
sleepers
france
must
not
even
adhere
to
this
government
with
the
assent
of
lethargy
at
certain
hours
in
certain
places
under
certain
shadows
to
sleep
is
to
die
let
us
add
that
at
this
moment
france
strange
to
say
but
none
the
less
true
knows
not
what
took
place
on
the
of
december
and
subsequently
or
knows
it
imperfectly
and
this
is
her
excuse
however
thanks
to
several
generous
and
courageous
publications
the
facts
are
beginning
to
creep
out
this
book
is
intended
to
bring
some
of
those
facts
forward
and
if
it
please
god
to
present
them
in
their
true
light
it
is
important
that
people
should
know
who
and
what
this
bonaparte
is
at
the
present
moment
thanks
to
the
suppression
of
the
platform
thanks
to
the
suppression
of
the
press
thanks
to
the
suppression
of
speech
of
liberty
and
of
truth
a
suppression
which
has
had
for
one
result
the
permitting
bonaparte
to
do
everything
but
which
has
had
at
the
same
time
the
effect
of
nullifying
all
his
measures
without
exception
including
the
indescribable
ballot
of
the
of
december
thanks
we
say
to
this
stifling
of
all
complaints
and
of
all
light
no
man
no
fact
wears
its
true
aspect
or
bears
its
true
name
bonaparte
crime
is
not
a
crime
it
is
called
a
necessity
bonaparte
ambuscade
is
not
an
ambuscade
it
is
called
a
defence
of
public
order
bonaparte
robberies
are
not
robberies
they
are
called
measures
of
state
bonaparte
murders
are
not
murders
they
are
called
public
safety
bonaparte
accomplices
are
not
malefactors
they
are
called
magistrates
senators
and
councillors
of
state
bonaparte
adversaries
are
not
the
soldiers
of
the
law
and
of
right
they
are
called
jacquerie
demagogues
communists
in
the
eyes
of
france
in
the
eyes
of
europe
the
of
december
is
still
masked
this
book
is
a
hand
issuing
from
the
darkness
and
tearing
that
mask
away
now
we
propose
to
scrutinize
this
triumph
of
order
to
depict
this
government
so
vigorous
so
firm
so
so
strong
having
on
its
side
a
crowd
of
paltry
youths
who
have
more
ambition
than
boots
dandies
and
beggars
sustained
on
the
bourse
by
fould
the
jew
and
in
the
church
by
montalembert
the
catholic
esteemed
by
women
who
would
fain
pass
for
maids
by
men
who
want
to
be
prefects
resting
on
a
coalition
of
prostitutions
giving
f√™tes
making
cardinals
wearing
white
and
yellow
kid
gloves
like
morny
newly
varnished
like
maupas
freshly
brushed
like
persigny
rich
elegant
clean
gilded
joyous
and
born
in
a
pool
of
blood
yes
men
will
awaken
yes
men
will
arouse
from
that
torpor
which
to
such
a
people
is
shame
and
when
france
does
awaken
when
she
does
open
her
eyes
when
she
does
distinguish
when
she
does
see
that
which
is
before
her
and
beside
her
she
will
recoil
with
a
terrible
shudder
from
the
monstrous
crime
which
dared
to
espouse
her
in
the
darkness
and
of
which
she
has
shared
the
bed
then
will
the
supreme
hour
strike
the
sceptics
smile
and
insist
they
say
hope
for
nothing
this
government
you
say
is
the
shame
of
france
be
it
so
but
this
same
shame
is
quoted
on
the
bourse
hope
for
nothing
you
are
poets
and
dreamers
if
you
hope
why
look
about
you
the
tribune
the
press
intelligence
speech
thought
all
that
was
liberty
has
vanished
yesterday
these
things
were
in
motion
alive
they
are
petrified
well
people
are
satisfied
with
this
petrification
they
accommodate
themselves
to
it
make
the
most
of
it
conduct
business
on
it
and
live
as
usual
society
goes
on
and
plenty
of
worthy
folk
are
well
pleased
with
this
state
of
things
why
do
you
want
to
change
it
to
put
an
end
to
it
do
deceive
yourselves
it
is
all
solid
all
firm
it
is
the
present
and
the
future
we
are
in
russia
the
neva
is
frozen
over
houses
are
built
on
the
ice
and
heavy
chariots
roll
over
it
it
is
no
longer
water
but
rock
the
people
go
to
and
fro
upon
this
marble
which
was
once
a
river
a
town
is
run
up
streets
are
marked
out

opened
people

light
fires
on
what
once
was
water
you
can
do
whatever
you
please
there
fear
nothing
laugh

it
is
more
solid
than
why
it
rings
beneath
the
foot
like
granite
long
live
winter
long
live
the
ice
this
will
last
till
doomsday
and
look
at
the
sky
is
it
day
is
it
night
what
is
it
a
pale
misty
light
steals
over
the
snow
one
would
say
that
the
sun
is
dying
no
thou
art
not
dying
o
liberty
one
of
these
days
at
the
moment
when
thou
art
least
expected
at
the
very
hour
when
they
shall
have
most
utterly
forgotten
thee
thou
wilt
rise
o
dazzling
vision
the
face
will
suddenly
be
seen
issuing
from
the
earth
resplendent
on
the
horizon
over
all
that
snow
over
all
that
ice
over
that
hard
white
plain
over
that
water
become
rock
over
all
that
wretched
winter
thou
wilt
cast
thy
arrow
of
gold
thy
ardent
and
effulgent
ray
light
heat
life
and
then
listen
hear
you
that
dull
sound
hear
you
that
crashing
noise
and
formidable
is
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
is
the
melting
of
the
neva
is
the
river
resuming
its
course
is
the
water
living
joyous
and
terrible
heaving
up
the
hideous
dead
ice
and
crushing
was
granite
said
you
see
it
splinters
like
glass
is
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
i
tell
you
is
the
truth
returning
is
progress
recommencing
is
mankind
resuming
its
march
and
uprooting
carrying
off
mingling
crushing
and
drowning
in
its
waves
like
the
wretched
furniture
of
a
submerged
hovel
not
only
the
empire
of
louis
bonaparte
but
all
the
structures
and
all
the
work
of
the
eternal
antique
despotism
look
on
these
things
as
they
are
passing
they
are
vanishing
for
ever
you
will
never
behold
them
again
that
book
half
submerged
is
the
old
code
of
iniquity
that
sinking
framework
is
the
throne
that
other
framework
floating
off
is
the
scaffold
and
for
this
immense
engulfment
this
supreme
victory
of
life
over
death
what
was
needed
one
glance
from

contenting
himself

alone

said
all
my
life
shall
be
devoted
to
strengthening
the
republic
published
a
manifesto
which
may
be
summed
up
in
two
lines
liberty
progress
democracy
amnesty
abolition
of
the
decrees
of
proscription
and
banishment
was
elected
president
by
votes
solemnly
swore
allegiance
to
the
constitution
on
the
of
december
and
on
the
of
december
shattered
that
constitution
in
the
interval
he
had
destroyed
the
roman
republic
and
had
restored
in
that
papacy
which
in
he
had
essayed
to
overthrow
he
had
besides
taken
nobody
knows
how
great
a
share
in
the
obscure
affair
of
the
lottery
of
the
gold
ingots
a
few
weeks
previous
to
the
this
bag
of
gold
became
transparent
and
there
was
visible
within
it
a
hand
greatly
resembling
his
on
december
and
the
following
days
he
the
executive
power
assailed
the
legislative
power
arrested
the
representatives
drove
out
the
assembly
dissolved
the
council
of
state
expelled
the
high
court
of
justice
suppressed
the
laws
took
francs
from
the
bank
gorged
the
army
with
gold
swept
the
streets
of
paris
with
and
terrorized
france
since
then
he
has
proscribed
representatives
of
the
people
stolen
from
the
princes
of
orleans
the
property
of
their
father
louis
philippe
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
decreed
despotism
in
articles
under
the
name
of
constitution
throttled
the
republic
made
the
sword
of
france
a
gag
in
the
mouth
of
liberty
pawned
the
railways
picked
the
pockets
of
the
people
regulated
the
budget
by
ukase
transported
to
africa
and
cayenne
ten
thousand
democrats
banished
to
belgium
spain
piedmont
switzerland
and
england
forty
thousand
republicans
brought
grief
to
every
heart
and
the
blush
of
shame
to
every
brow
louis
bonaparte
thinks
that
he
is
mounting
the
steps
of
a
throne
he
does
not
perceive
that
he
is
mounting
those
of
a
scaffold
vi
portrait
louis
bonaparte
is
a
man
of
middle
height
cold
pale
slow
in
his
movements
having
the
air
of
a
person
not
quite
awake
he
has
published
as
we
have
mentioned
before
a
moderately
esteemed
treatise
on
artillery
and
is
thought
to
be
acquainted
with
the
handling
of
cannon
he
is
a
good
horseman
he
speaks
drawlingly
with
a
slight
german
accent
his
histrionic
abilities
were
displayed
at
the
eglinton
tournament
he
has
a
heavy
moustache
covering
his
smile
like
that
of
the
duke
of
alva
and
a
lifeless
eye
like
that
of
charles
ix
judging
him
apart
from
what
he
calls
his
necessary
acts
or
his
great
deeds
he
is
a
vulgar
commonplace
personage
puerile
theatrical
and
vain
those
persons
who
are
invited
to
st
cloud
in
the
summer
receive
with
the
invitation
an
order
to
bring
a
morning
toilette
and
an
evening
toilette
he
loves
finery
display
feathers
embroidery
tinsel
and
spangles
big
words
and
grand
titles
everything
that
makes
a
noise
and
glitter
all
the
glassware
of
power
in
his
capacity
of
cousin
to
the
battle
of
austerlitz
he
dresses
as
a
general
he
cares
little
about
being
despised
he
contents
himself
with
the
appearance
of
respect
this
man
would
tarnish
the
background
of
history
he
absolutely
sullies
its
foreground
europe
smiled
when
glancing
at
haiti
she
saw
this
white
soulouque
appear
but
there
is
now
in
europe
in
every
intelligent
mind
abroad
as
at
home
a
profound
stupor
a
feeling
as
it
were
of
personal
insult
for
the
european
continent
whether
it
will
or
no
is
responsible
for
france
and
whatever
abases
france
humiliates
europe
before
the
of
december
the
leaders
of
the
right
used
freely
to
say
of
louis
bonaparte
is
an
they
were
mistaken
to
be
sure
that
brain
of
his
is
awry
and
has
gaps
in
it
but
one
can
discern
here
and
there
thoughts
consecutive
and
concatenate
it
is
a
book
whence
pages
have
been
torn
louis
napoleon
has
a
fixed
idea
but
a
fixed
idea
is
not
idiocy
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
he
goes
straight
to
it
through
justice
through
law
through
reason
through
honour
through
humanity
it
may
be
but
straight
on
none
the
less
he
is
not
an
idiot
he
is
a
man
of
another
age
than
our
own
he
seems
absurd
and
mad
because
he
is
out
of
his
place
and
time
transport
him
to
spain
in
the
century
and
philip
ii
would
recognise
him
to
england
and
henry
viii
would
smile
on
him
to
italy
and
c√¶sar
borgia
would
jump
on
his
neck
or
even
confine
yourself
to
setting
him
outside
the
pale
of
european
civilization
place
him
in
at
janina
and
would
grasp
him
by
the
hand
there
is
in
him
something
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
the
lower
empire
that
which
he
does
would
have
seemed
perfectly
simple
and
natural
to
michael
ducas
to
romanus
diogenes
to
nicephorus
botoniates
to
the
eunuch
narses
to
the
vandal
stilico
to
mahomet
ii
to
alexander
vi
to
ezzelino
of
padua
as
it
seems
perfectly
simple
and
natural
to
himself
but
he
forgets
or
knows
not
that
in
the
age
wherein
we
live
his
actions
will
have
to
traverse
the
great
streams
of
human
morality
set
free
by
three
centuries
of
literature
and
by
the
french
revolution
and
that
in
this
medium
his
actions
will
wear
their
true
aspect
and
appear
what
they
really
are
hideous
his
partisans
he
has
some
complacently
compare
him
with
his
uncle
the
first
bonaparte
they
say
the
one
accomplished
the
brumaire
the
other
the
of
december
they
are
two
ambitious
men
the
first
bonaparte
aimed
to
reconstruct
the
empire
of
the
west
to
make
europe
his
vassal
to
dominate
the
continent
by
his
power
and
to
dazzle
it
by
his
grandeur
to
take
an
himself
and
give
footstools
to
the
kings
to
cause
history
to
say
nimrod
cyrus
alexander
hannibal
c√¶sar
charlemagne
napoleon
to
be
a
master
of
the
world
and
so
he
was
it
was
for
that
that
he
accomplished
the
brumaire
this
fellow
would
fain
have
horses
and
women
be
called
and
live
luxuriously
it
was
for
this
that
he
accomplished
the
of
december
yes
they
are
both
ambitious
the
comparison
is
just
let
us
add
that
like
the
first
bonaparte
the
second
also
aims
to
be
emperor
but
that
which
somewhat
impairs
the
force
of
the
comparison
is
that
there
is
perhaps
a
slight
difference
between
conquering
an
empire
and
pilfering
it
however
this
may
be
that
which
is
certain
and
which
can
not
be
veiled
even
by
the
dazzling
curtain
of
glory
and
of
misfortune
on
which
are
inscribed
arcola
lodi
the
pyramids
eylau
friedland
helena
that
which
is
certain
we
repeat
is
that
the
brumaire
was
a
crime
of
which
the
of
december
has
aggravated
the
stain
on
the
memory
of
napoleon
louis
bonaparte
does
not
object
to
have
it
whispered
that
he
is
a
socialist
he
feels
that
this
gives
him
a
sort
of
vague
field
which
ambition
may
exploit
as
we
have
already
said
when
he
was
in
prison
he
passed
his
time
in
acquiring
a
as
a
democrat
one
fact
will
describe
him
when
being
at
ham
he
published
his
book
on
the
extinction
of
pauperism
a
book
having
apparently
for
its
sole
and
exclusive
aim
to
probe
the
wound
of
the
poverty
of
the
common
people
and
to
suggest
the
remedy
he
sent
the
book
to
one
of
his
friends
with
this
note
which
we
have
ourselves
seen
read
this
book
on
pauperism
and
tell
me
if
you
think
it
is
calculated
do
me
the
great
talent
of
louis
bonaparte
is
silence
before
the
of
december
he
had
a
council
of
ministers
who
being
responsible
imagined
that
they
were
of
some
consequence
the
president
presided
never
or
scarcely
ever
did
he
take
part
in
their
discussions
while
mm
odillon
barrot
passy
tocqueville
dufaure
or
faucher
were
speaking
occupied
says
one
of
these
ministers
constructing
with
intense
earnestness
paper
dolls
or
in
drawing
men
heads
on
the
documents
before
to
feign
death
that
is
his
art
he
remains
mute
and
motionless
looking
in
the
opposite
direction
from
his
object
until
the
hour
for
action
comes
then
he
turns
his
head
and
leaps
upon
his
prey
his
policy
appears
to
you
abruptly
at
some
unexpected
turning
pistol
in
hand
like
a
thief
up
to
that
point
there
is
the
least
possible
movement
for
one
moment
in
the
course
of
the
three
years
that
have
just
passed
he
was
seen
face
to
face
with
changarnier
who
also
on
his
part
had
a
scheme
in
view
ibant
obscuri
as
virgil
says
france
observed
with
a
certain
anxiety
these
two
men
what
was
in
their
minds
did
not
the
one
dream
of
cromwell
the
other
of
monk
men
asked
one
another
these
questions
as
they
looked
on
the
two
men
in
both
of
them
there
was
the
same
attitude
of
mystery
the
same
policy
of
immobility
bonaparte
said
not
a
word
changarnier
made
not
a
gesture
this
one
did
not
stir
that
one
did
not
breathe
they
seemed
to
be
playing
the
game
of
which
should
be
the
most
statuesque
this
silence
of
his
louis
bonaparte
sometimes
breaks
but
then
he
does
not
speak
he
lies
this
man
lies
as
other
men
breathe
he
announces
an
honest
intention
be
on
your
guard
he
makes
an
assertion
distrust
him
he
takes
an
oath
tremble
machiavel
made
small
men
louis
bonaparte
is
one
of
them
to
announce
an
enormity
against
which
the
world
protests
to
disavow
it
with
indignation
to
swear
by
all
the
gods
to
declare
himself
an
honest
man
and
then
at
the
moment
when
people
are
reassured
and
laugh
at
the
enormity
in
question
to
execute
it
this
was
his
course
with
respect
to
the
with
respect
to
the
decrees
of
proscription
with
respect
to
the
spoliation
of
the
princes
of
orleans
and
so
it
will
be
with
the
invasion
of
belgium
and
of
switzerland
and
with
everything
else
it
is
his
way
you
may
think
what
you
please
of
it
he
employs
it
he
finds
it
effective
it
is
his
affair
he
will
have
to
settle
the
matter
with
history
you
are
of
his
familiar
circle
he
hints
at
a
project
which
seems
to
you
not
immoral
one
does
not
scrutinize
so
closely
but
insane
and
dangerous
and
dangerous
to
himself
you
raise
objections
he
listens
makes
no
reply
sometimes
gives
way
for
a
day
or
two
then
resumes
his
project
and
carries
out
his
will
there
is
in
his
table
in
his
office
at
the
√©lys√©e
a
drawer
frequently
half
open
he
takes
thence
a
paper
reads
it
to
a
minister
it
is
a
decree
the
minister
assents
or
dissents
if
he
dissents
louis
bonaparte
throws
the
paper
back
into
the
drawer
where
there
are
many
other
papers
the
dreams
of
an
omnipotent
man
shuts
the
drawer
takes
out
the
key
and
leaves
the
room
without
saying
a
word
the
minister
bows
and
retires
delighted
with
the
deference
which
has
been
paid
to
his
opinion
next
morning
the
decree
is
in
the
sometimes
with
the
minister
signature
thanks
to
this
he
has
always
in
his
service
the
unforeseen
a
mighty
weapon
and
encountering
in
himself
no
internal
obstacle
in
that
which
is
known
to
other
men
as
conscience
he
pursues
his
design
through
no
matter
what
no
matter
how
and
attains
his
goal
he
draws
back
sometimes
not
before
the
moral
effect
of
his
acts
but
before
their
material
effect
the
decrees
of
expulsion
of
representatives
of
the
people
published
on
january
in
the
revolted
public
sentiment
fast
bound
as
france
was
the
shudder
was
perceptible
the
of
december
was
not
long
past
there
was
danger
in
popular
excitement
louis
bonaparte
understood
this
next
day
a
second
decree
of
expulsion
was
to
have
appeared
containing
eight
hundred
names
louis
bonaparte
had
the
proof
brought
to
him
from
the
the
list
occupied
fourteen
columns
of
the
official
journal
he
crumpled
the
proof
threw
it
into
the
fire
and
the
decree
did
not
appear
the
proscriptions
proceeded
without
a
decree
in
his
enterprises
he
needs
aids
and
collaborators
he
needs
what
he
calls
men
diogenes
sought
them
with
a
lantern
he
seeks
them
with
a
banknote
in
his
hand
and
finds
them
there
are
certain
sides
of
human
nature
which
produce
a
particular
species
of
persons
of
whom
he
is
the
centre
and
who
group
around
him
in
obedience
to
that
mysterious
law
of
gravitation
which
regulates
the
moral
being
no
less
than
the
cosmic
atom
to
undertake
the
act
of
the
of
december
to
execute
it
and
to
complete
it
he
needed
these
men
and
he
had
them
now
he
is
surrounded
by
them
these
men
form
his
retinue
his
court
mingling
their
radiance
with
his
at
certain
epochs
of
history
there
are
pleiades
of
great
men
at
other
epochs
there
are
pleiades
of
vagabonds
but
do
not
confound
the
epoch
the
moment
of
louis
bonaparte
with
the
century
the
toadstool
sprouts
at
the
foot
of
the
oak
but
it
is
not
the
oak
louis
bonaparte
has
succeeded
he
has
with
him
henceforth
money
speculation
the
bourse
the
bank
the
the
and
all
those
men
who
pass
so
readily
from
one
side
to
the
other
when
all
they
have
to
straddle
is
shame
he
made
of
changarnier
a
dupe
of
thiers
a
of
de
montalembert
an
accomplice
of
power
a
cavern
of
the
budget
his
farm
they
are
coining
at
the
mint
a
medal
called
the
medal
of
the
of
december
in
honour
of
the
manner
in
which
he
keeps
his
oaths
the
frigate
has
been
debaptized
and
is
now
called
he
can
when
he
chooses
be
crowned
by
sibour
and
exchange
the
couch
of
the
√©lys√©e
for
the
state
bed
of
the
tuileries
meanwhile
for
the
last
seven
months
he
has
been
displaying
himself
he
has
harangued
triumphed
presided
at
banquets
given
balls
danced
reigned
turned
himself
about
in
all
directions
he
has
paraded
himself
in
all
his
ugliness
in
a
box
at
the
op√©ra
he
has
had
himself
dubbed
he
has
distributed
standards
to
the
army
and
crosses
of
honour
to
the
commissioners
of
police
when
there
was
occasion
to
select
a
symbol
he
effaced
himself
and
chose
the
eagle
modesty
of
a
the
archbishop
of
paris
vii
in
continuation
of
the
panegyrics
he
has
succeeded
the
result
is
that
he
has
plenty
of
apotheoses
of
panegyrists
he
has
more
than
trajan
one
thing
however
has
struck
me
which
is
that
among
all
the
qualities
that
have
been
discovered
in
him
since
the
of
december
among
all
the
eulogies
that
have
been
addressed
to
him
there
is
not
one
word
outside
of
this
circle
adroitness
coolness
daring
address
an
affair
admirably
prepared
and
conducted
moment
well
chosen
secret
well
kept
measures
well
taken
false
keys
well
made
that
the
whole
story
when
these
things
have
been
said
all
has
been
said
except
a
phrase
or
two
about
clemency
and
yet
no
one
extols
the
magnanimity
of
mandrin
who
sometimes
did
not
take
all
the
traveller
money
and
of
jean
who
sometimes
did
not
kill
all
travellers
in
endowing
bonaparte
with
twelve
millions
of
francs
and
four
millions
more
for
keeping
up
the
ch√¢teaux
the
senate
endowed
by
bonaparte
with
a
million
felicitated
bonaparte
upon
having
saved
society
much
as
a
character
in
a
comedy
congratulates
another
on
having
saved
the
for
myself
i
am
still
seeking
in
the
glorification
of
bonaparte
by
his
most
ardent
apologists
any
praise
that
would
not
exactly
befit
cartouche
or
poulailler
after
a
good
stroke
of
business
and
i
blush
sometimes
for
the
french
language
and
for
the
name
of
napoleon
at
the
terms
really
and
too
thinly
veiled
and
too
appropriate
to
the
facts
in
which
the
magistracy
and
clergy
felicitate
this
man
on
having
stolen
the
power
of
the
state
by
burglarising
the
constitution
and
on
having
by
night
evaded
his
oath
when
all
the
burglaries
and
all
the
robberies
which
constitute
the
success
of
his
policy
had
been
accomplished
he
resumed
his
true
name
every
one
then
saw
that
this
man
was
a
monseigneur
it
was
fortoul
to
his
honour
be
it
said
who
first
made
this
discovery
the
first
report
addressed
to
bonaparte
and
in
which
bonaparte
is
called
is
signed
fortoul
when
one
measures
the
man
and
finds
him
so
small
and
then
measures
his
success
and
finds
it
so
enormous
it
is
impossible
that
the
mind
should
not
experience
some
surprise
one
asks
oneself
how
did
he
do
it
one
dissects
the
adventure
and
the
adventurer
and
laying
aside
the
advantage
he
derives
from
his
name
and
certain
external
facts
of
which
he
made
use
in
his
escalade
one
finds
as
the
basis
of
the
man
and
his
exploit
but
two
things
cunning
and
cash
as
to
cunning
we
have
already
characterised
this
important
quality
of
louis
bonaparte
but
it
is
desirable
to
dwell
on
the
point
on
november
he
said
to
his
in
his
manifesto
i
feel
it
incumbent
on
me
to
make
known
to
you
my
sentiments
and
my
principles
must
be
no
equivocation
between
you
and
me
i
am
not
ambitious
brought
up
in
countries
in
the
school
of
misfortune
shall
ever
remain
to
the
duties
that
shall
be
imposed
on
me
by
your
suffrages
and
the
will
of
the
assembly
shall
make
it
a
point
of
honour
to
leave
at
the
end
of
the
four
years
to
my
successor
power
consolidated
liberty
intact
and
real
progress
on
december
in
his
first
message
to
the
assembly
he
wrote
it
is
my
aspiration
to
be
worthy
of
the
confidence
of
the
nation
by
maintaining
the
constitution
i
have
sworn
to
on
november
in
his
second
annual
message
to
the
assembly
he
said
if
the
constitution
contains
defects
and
dangers
you
are
free
to
make
them
known
to
the
country
i
alone
by
my
confine
myself
within
the
strict
limits
which
that
constitution
has
traced
on
september
in
the
same
year
at
caen
he
said
when
in
all
directions
prosperity
seems
reviving
he
were
indeed
guilty
who
should
seek
to
check
its
progress
by
that
which
now
some
time
before
on
july
at
the
inauguration
of
the
quentin
railway
he
went
to
ham
smote
his
breast
at
the
recollection
of
boulogne
and
uttered
these
solemn
words
now
that
elected
by
universal
france
i
am
become
the
legitimate
head
of
this
great
nation
i
can
not
pride
myself
on
a
captivity
which
was
occasioned
by
attack
upon
a
regular
when
one
has
observed
the
enormous
evils
which
even
the
most
righteous
revolutions
bring
in
their
train
one
can
scarcely
comprehend
in
having
chosen
to
take
upon
one
self
the
terrible
responsibility
of
a
i
do
not
therefore
complain
of
having
here
by
an
imprisonment
of
six
years
my
defiance
of
the
laws
of
my
and
it
is
with
joy
that
in
the
very
scene
of
my
sufferings
i
propose
to
you
a
toast
in
honour
of
those
who
notwithstanding
their
convictions
are
resolute
to
the
institutions
of
their
all
the
while
he
was
saying
this
he
retained
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
as
he
has
since
proved
after
his
fashion
that
thought
which
he
had
written
in
that
same
prison
of
ham

enterprises
seldom
succeed
at
the
first
attempt
towards
the
middle
of

still
talking
about
what
about

and
said
to
him
with
feeling

thank
you

at
least
do
not
think
me
a
scoundrel

fortnight

moment

let
us
proceed
next
day
june
the
commandant
m√©sonan
who
i
thought
had
gone
entered
my
room
announced
by
my
i
said
to
him
i
thought
you
were
gone
general
i
am
not
gone
i
have
a
letter
to
give
you
letter
and
from
whom
it
general
i
asked
him
to
take
a
seat
i
took
the
letter
but
as
i
was
opening
it
i
saw
that
the
address
was
le
commandant
i
said
to
him
my
dear
commandant
this
is
for
you
not
for
me
it
general
i
opened
the
letter
and
read
thus
dear
commandant
it
is
most
essential
that
you
should
immediately
see
the
general
in
question
you
know
he
is
a
man
of
resolution
on
whom
one
may
rely
you
know
also
that
he
is
a
man
whom
i
have
put
down
to
be
one
day
a
marshal
of
france
will
offer
him
from
me
and
you
will
ask
him
into
what
banker
or
notary
hands
shall
pay
for
him
in
the
event
of
his
losing
his
command
i
stopped
here
overcome
with
indignation
i
turned
over
the
leaf
and
i
saw
that
the
letter
was
signed
napoleon
i
handed
the
letter
back
to
the
commandant
saying
that
it
was
a
ridiculous
and
abortive
affair
who
speaks
thus
general
magnan
where
in
the
open
court
of
peers
before
whom
who
is
the
man
seated
on
the
prisoners
bench
the
man
whom
magnan
covers
with
scorn
the
man
towards
whom
magnan
turns
his
indignant
face
louis
bonaparte
money
and
with
money
gross
debauchery
such
were
his
means
of
action
in
his
three
enterprises
at
strasburg
at
boulogne
at
paris
two
failures
and
a
success
magnan
who
refused
at
boulogne
sold
himself
at
paris
if
louis
bonaparte
had
been
defeated
on
the
of
december
just
as
there
were
found
on
him
at
boulogne
the
francs
he
had
brought
from
london
so
there
would
have
been
found
at
the
√©lys√©e
the
millions
taken
from
the
bank
there
has
then
been
in
france
one
must
needs
speak
of
these
things
coolly
in
france
that
land
of
the
sword
that
land
of
cavaliers
the
land
of
hoche
of
drouot
and
of
bayard
there
has
been
a
day
when
a
man
surrounded
by
five
or
six
political
sharpers
experts
in
ambuscades
and
grooms
of
lolling
in
a
gilded
office
his
feet
on
the
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
placed
a
price
upon
military
honour
weighed
it
in
the
scales
like
a
commodity
a
thing
buyable
and
sellable
put
down
the
general
at
a
million
the
private
at
a
louis
and
said
of
the
conscience
of
the
french
army
that
is
worth
so
much
and
this
man
is
the
nephew
of
the
emperor
by
the
bye
this
nephew
is
not
proud
he
accommodates
himself
with
great
facility
to
the
necessities
of
his
adventures
adapts
himself
readily
and
without
reluctance
to
every
freak
of
destiny
place
him
in
london
and
let
it
be
his
interest
to
please
the
english
government
he
would
not
hesitate
and
with
the
very
hand
which
now
seeks
to
seize
the
sceptre
of
charlemagne
he
would
grasp
the
truncheon
of
a
policeman
if
i
were
not
napoleon
i
would
be
vidocq
and
here
thought
pauses
and
such
is
the
man
by
whom
france
is
governed
governed
do
i
say
possessed
rather
in
full
sovereignty
and
every
day
and
every
moment
by
his
decrees
by
his
messages
by
his
harangues
by
all
these
unprecedented
imbecilities
which
he
parades
in
the
this
so
ignorant
of
france
gives
lessons
to
france
and
this
knave
tells
france
that
he
has
saved
her
from
whom
from
herself
before
he
came
providence
did
nothing
but
absurdities
god
waited
for
him
to
put
everything
in
order
and
at
length
he
came
for
the
last
years
poor
france
had
been
afflicted
with
all
sorts
of
pernicious
things
that
sonority
the
tribune
that
hubbub
the
press
that
insolence
thought
that
crying
abuse
liberty
he
came
and
for
the
tribune
he
substituted
the
senate
for
the
press
the
censorship
for
thought
imbecility
for
liberty
the
sabre
and
by
the
sabre
the
censorship
imbecility
and
the
senate
france
is
saved
saved
bravo
and
from
whom
i
ask
again
from
herself
for
what
was
france
before
if
you
please
a
horde
of
pillagers
robbers
jacquerie
assassins
demagogues
it
was
necessary
to
put
fetters
on
this
abominable
villain
this
france
and
it
was
bonaparte
louis
who
applied
the
fetters
now
france
is
in
prison
on
bread
and
water
punished
humiliated
throttled
and
well
guarded

tranquil
everybody

what
spectacle

what
dream

what
nightmare
is
this
on
the
one
hand
a
nation
first
among
nations
and
on
the
other
a

last
among
men
and
see
what
that
man
does
to
that
nation
god
save
the
mark
he
tramples
her
under
foot
he
laughs
at
her
to
her
face
he
flouts
her
he
denies
her
he
insults
her
he
scoffs
at
her
how
now
he
says
there
is
none
but
i
what
in
this
land
of
france
where
no

may
be
boxed
with
impunity
one
may
box
the
ears
of
the
whole
people
oh
abominable
shame
each
time
that
bonaparte
spits
every
one
must
needs
wipe
his

this
can
last
and
you
tell
me
that
it
will
last

the

and
which

abolishes
liberty
was
evidently
and
happily
inspired
in
bonaparte
by
an
old
provincial
which
it
is
well
to
recall
at
this
time
this
day
the
grand
representation
of
la

then
certainly
this
great
body
this

this
supreme

is
in
truth
the
principal
glory
of
the
constitution
let
us
consider
it
for
a
moment
the
senate
it
is
a
senate
but
of
what
senate
are
you
speaking
is
it
the
senate
whose
duty
it
was
to
deliberate
on
the
description
of
sauce
with
which
the
emperor
should
eat
his
turbot
is
it
the
senate
of
which
napoleon
thus
spoke
on
april
a
sign
was
an
order
for
the
senate
and
it
always
did
more
than
was
required
of
it
is
it
the
senate
of
which
napoleon
said
in
the
poltroons
were
afraid
of
displeasing
me
is
it
the
senate
which
drew
from
tiberius
almost
the
same
exclamation
the
base
wretches
greater
slaves
than
we
require
them
to
be
is
it
the
senate
which
caused
charles
xii
to
say
send
my
boot
to
stockholm
for
what
purpose
sire
demanded
his
to
preside
over
the
senate
was
the
reply
thibaudeau
of
the
consulate
and
the
but
let
us
not
trifle
this
year
they
are
eighty
they
will
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
next
year
they
monopolise
to
themselves
in
full
plenitude
fourteen
articles
of
the
constitution
from
article
to
article
they
are
guardians
of
the
public
liberties
their
functions
are
gratuitous
by
article
consequently
they
have
from
fifteen
to
thirty
thousand
francs
per
annum
they
have
the
peculiar
privilege
of
receiving
their
salary
and
the
prerogative
of
not
opposing
the
promulgation
of
the
laws
they
are
all
illustrious
personages
this
is
not
an
abortive
senate
like
that
of
napoleon
the
uncle
this
is
a
genuine
senate
the
marshals
are
members
and
the
cardinals
and
leboeuf
all
the
illustrious
persons
of
the
country
louis
bonaparte
to
the
december
the
senate
was
an
abortion
and
in
france
no
one
likes
to
see
people
well
paid
merely
for
making
some
bad
selections
words
of
napoleon
from
what
is
your
position
in
the
country
some
one
asks
the
senate
we
are
charged
with
the
preservation
of
public
liberty
what
is
your
business
in
this
city
pierrot
demands

my
business
replies
harlequin
is
to
the
bronze
horse
we
know
what
is
meant
by
this
spirit
will
urge
the
senate
by
every
possible
means
to
augment
its
power
it
will
destroy
the
corps
l√©gislatif
if
it
can
and
if
occasion
offers
it
will
compound
with
the
bourbons
who
said
this
the
first
consul
where
at
the
tuileries
in
april
without
title
or
authority
and
in
violation
of
every
principle
it
has
surrendered
the
country
and
consummated
its
ruin
it
has
been
the
plaything
of
eminent
intriguers
i
know
of
no
body
which
ought
to
appear
in
history
with
greater
ignominy
than
the
senate
who
said
this
the
emperor
where
at
helena
there
is
actually
then
a
senate
in
the
constitution
of
january
but
candidly
speaking
this
is
a
mistake
for
now
that
public
hygiene
has
made
some
progress
we
are
accustomed
to
see
the
public
highway
better
kept
after
the
senate
of
the
empire
we
thought
that
no
more
senates
would
be
mixed
up
with
constitutions
iii
the
council
of
state
and
the
corps
l√©gislatif
there
is
also
a
council
of
state
and
a
corps
l√©gislatif
the
former
joyous
well
paid
plump
rosy
fat
and
fresh
with
a
sharp
eye
a
red

a
voluble
tongue
a

by
its
side
a
belly
and
embroidered
in

the
corps
l√©gislatif
pale
meagre
sad
and
embroidered
in
silver
the
council
of
state
comes
and
goes
enters
and
exits
returns
rules
disposes
decides
settles
and
decrees
and
sees
louis
napoleon
face
to
face
the
corps
l√©gislatif
on
the
contrary
walks
on
tiptoe
fumbles
with
its
hat
puts
its
finger
to
its
lips
smiles
humbly
sits
on
the
corner
of
its
chair
and
speaks
only
when
questioned
its
words
being
naturally
obscene
the
public
journals
are
forbidden
to
make
the
slightest
allusion
to
them
the
corps
l√©gislatif
passes
laws
and
votes
taxes
by
article
and
when
fancying
it
has
occasion
for
some
instruction
some
detail
some
figures
or
some
explanation
it
presents
itself
hat
in
hand
at
the
door
of
the
departments
to
consult
the
ministers
the
usher
receives
it
in
the
antechamber
and
with
a
roar
of
laughter
gives
it
a
fillip
on
the
nose
such
are
the
duties
of
the
corps
l√©gislatif
let
us
state
however
that
this
melancholy
position
began
in
june
to
extort
some
sighs
from
the
sorrowful
personages
who
form
a
portion
of
the
concern
the
report
of
the
commission
on
the
budget
will
remain
in
the
memory
of
men
as
one
of
the
most
masterpieces
of
the
plaintive
style
let
us
repeat
those
gentle
accents
formerly
as
you
know
the
necessary
communications
in
such
cases
were
carried
on
directly
between
the
commissioners
and
the
ministers
it
was
to
the
latter
that
they
addressed
themselves
to
obtain
the
documents
indispensable
to
the
discussion
of
affairs
and
the
ministers
even
came
personally
with
the
heads
of
their
several
departments
to
give
verbal
explanations
frequently
sufficient
to
preclude
the
necessity
of
further
discussion
and
the
resolutions
formed
by
the
commission
on
the
budget
after
they
had
heard
them
were
submitted
direct
to
the
chamber
but
now
we
can
have
no
communication
with
the
government
except
through
the
medium
of
the
council
of
state
which
being
the
confidant
and
the
organ
of
its
own
ideas
has
alone
the
right
of
transmitting
to
the
corps
l√©gislatif
the
documents
which
in
its
turn
it
receives
from
the
ministers
in
a
word
for
written
reports
as
well
as
for
verbal
communications
the
government
commissioners
have
superseded
the
ministers
with
whom
however
they
must
have
a
preliminary
understanding
with
respect
to
the
modifications
which
the
commission
might
wish
to
propose
whether
by
the
adoption
of
amendments
presented
by
the
deputies
or
from
its
own
examination
of
the
budget
they
must
before
you
are
called
upon
to
consider
them
be
sent
to
the
council
of
state
there
to
undergo
discussion
there
it
is
impossible
not
to
notice
it
those
modifications
have
no
interpreters
no
official
defenders
this
mode
of
procedure
appears
to
be
derived
from
the
constitution
itself
and
we
speak
of
the
matter
it
is
to
prove
to
you
that
it
must
occasion
in
accomplishing
the
task
imposed

was
never
so
mildly
uttered
it
is
impossible
to
receive
more
chastely
and
more
gracefully
what
bonaparte
in
his
autocratic
style
calls
guarantees
of
calmness

such
as

maintaining
in
the

a
more
expensive

that

the

that
certainly
is
an
advantage
but
in
a
practical
point
of
view
with
reference
to

is
the

quite
sure
of
what
it
has
done
on
that
head
is
it
quite
sure
that
the
sixth

will
answer
better
than
the
excellent
assize
court
of
paris
for
instance
which
had
for
president
such
abject
creatures
as
and
for
advocates
at
its
bar
such
base
wretches
as
suin
and
such
dull
orators
as
mongis
can
it
reasonably
expect
that
the

judges
will
be
still
more
base
and
more
contemptible
than
they
will
those
judges

as
they
are

better
than
that
who
had

for

and
who
pronounced
their

and
gesticulated
their

with
the
precision
of
a

in
double
quick
time
so
that
the
prefect
of

observed
to

celebrated

what
a
stupid
institution
when
not
forced
to
it
they
never
condemn
but
when
forced
they
never
let
us
weep
for
that
worthy
jury
which
was
made
by
carlier
and
unmade
by
rouher
this
government
feels
that
it
is
hideous
it
wants
no
portrait
above
all
it
wants
no
mirror
like
the
osprey
it
takes
refuge
in
darkness
and
it
would
die
if
once
seen
now
it
wishes
to
endure
it
does
not
propose
to
be
talked
about
it
does
not
propose
to
be
described
it
has
imposed
silence
on
the
press
of
france
we
have
seen
in
what
manner
but
to
silence
the
press
in
france
was
only
it
must
also
be
silenced
in
foreign
countries
two
prosecutions
were
attempted
in
belgium
against
the
and
against
they
were
acquitted
by
an
honest
belgian
jury
this
was
annoying
what
was
to
be
done
the
belgian
journals
were
attacked
through
their
pockets
you
have
subscribers
in
france
they
were
told
but
if
you
us
you
shall
be
kept
out
if
you
wish
to
come
in
make
yourselves
agreeable
an
attempt
was
made
to
frighten
the
english
journals
if
you
us
decidedly
they
do
not
wish
to
be
we
shall
drive
your
correspondents
out
of
france
the
english
press
roared
with
laughter
but
this
is
not
all
there
are
french
writers
outside
of
france
they
are
proscribed
that
is
to
say
they
are
free
suppose
those
fellows
should
speak
suppose
those
demagogues
should
write
they
are
very
capable
of
doing
both
and
we
must
prevent
them
but
how
are
we
to
do
it
to
gag
people
at
a
distance
is
not
so
easy
a
matter
bonaparte
arm
is
not
long
enough
for
that
let
us
try
however
we
will
prosecute
them
in
the
countries
where
they
have
taken
refuge
very
good
the
juries
of
free
countries
will
understand
that
these
exiles
represent
justice
and
that
the
bonapartist
government
personifies
iniquity
these
juries
will
follow
the
example
of
the
belgian
jury
and
acquit
the
friendly
governments
will
then
be
solicited
to
expel
these
refugees
to
banish
these
exiles
very
good
the
exiles
will
go
elsewhere
they
will
always
find
some
corner
of
the
earth
open
to
them
where
they
can
speak
how
then
are
they
to
be
got
at
rouher
and
baroche
clubbed
their
wits
together
and
between
them
they
hit
upon
this
expedient
to
patch
up
a
law
dealing
with
crimes
committed
by
frenchmen
in
foreign
countries
and
to
slip
into
it
crimes
of
the
press
the
council
of
state
sanctioned
this
and
the
corps
l√©gislatif
did
not
oppose
it
and
it
is
now
the
law
of
the
land
if
we
speak
outside
of
france
we
shall
be
condemned
for
the
offence
in
france
imprisonment
in
future
if
caught
fines
and
confiscations
again
very
good
the
book
i
am
now
writing
will
therefore
be
tried
in
france
and
its
author
duly
convicted
this
i
expect
and
i
confine
myself
to
apprising
all
those
quidams
calling
themselves
magistrates
who
in
black
and
red
gown
shall
concoct
the
thing
that
sentence
to
any
fine
whatever
being
well
and
duly
pronounced
against
me
nothing
will
equal
my
disdain
for
the
judgment
but
my
contempt
for
the
judges
this
is
my
defence
vii
the
adherents
who
are
they
that
flock
round
the
establishment
as
we
have
said
the
gorge
rises
at
thought
of
them
ah
these
rulers
of
the
day
we
who
are
now
proscribed
remember
them
when
they
were
representatives
of
the
people
only
twelve
months
ago
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
lobbies
of
the
assembly
their
heads
high
and
with
a
show
of
independence
and
the
air
and
manner
of
men
who
belonged
to
themselves
what
magnificence
and
how
proud
they
were
how
they
placed
their
hands
on
their
hearts
while
they
shouted
vive
la
republique
and
if
some
terrorist
some
montagnard
or
some
red
republican
happened
to
allude
from
the
tribune
to
the
planned
and
the
projected
empire
how
they
vociferated
at
him
you
are
a
calumniator
how
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
at
the
word
senate
the
empire
cried
one
would
be
blood
and
slime
you
slander
us
we
shall
never
be
implicated
in
such
a
matter
another
affirmed
that
he
consented
to
be
one
of
the
president
ministers
solely
to
devote
himself
to
the
defence
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
a
third
glorified
the
tribune
as
the
palladium
of
the
country
a
fourth
recalled
the
oath
of
louis
bonaparte
exclaiming
do
you
doubt
that
he
is
an
honest
man
these
last
there
were
two
of
them
went
the
length
of
voting
for
and
signing
his
deposition
on
the
of
december
at
the
mayoralty
of
the
tenth
arrondissement
another
sent
a
note
on
the
of
december
to
the
writer
of
these
lines
to
felicitate
him
on
having
dictated
the
proclamation
of
the
left
by
which
louis
bonaparte
was
outlawed
and
now
behold
them
senators
councillors
of
state
ministers
belaced
betagged
bedizened
with
gold
base
wretches
before
you
embroider
your
sleeves
wash
your
hands
paid
a
visit
to
and
said
to
him
can
you
conceive
the
assurance
of
this
bonaparte
he
has
had
the
presumption
to
offer
me
the
place
of
master
of
requests
you
refused
it
certainly
the
next
day
being
offered
the
place
of
councillor
of
state
salary
thousand
francs
our
indignant
master
of
requests
becomes
a
grateful
councillor
of
state
accepts
one
class
of
men
rallied
en
masse
the
fools
they
comprise
the
sound
part
of
the
corps
l√©gislatif
it
was
to
them
that
the
head
of
the
state
addressed
this
little
flattery
the
first
test
of
the
constitution
entirely
of
french
origin
must
have
convinced
you
that
we
possess
the
qualities
of
a
strong
and
a
free
government
we
are
in
earnest
discussion
is
free
and
the
vote
of
taxation
decisive
france
possesses
a
government
animated
by
faith
and
by
love
of
the
right
which
is
based
upon
the
people
the
source
of
all
power
upon
the
army
the
source
of
all
strength
and
upon
religion
the
source
of
all
justice
accept
the
assurance
of
my
regard
these
worthy
dupes
we
know
them
also
we
have
seen
a
goodly
number
of
them
on
the
benches
of
the
majority
in
the
legislative
assembly
their
chiefs
skilful
manipulators
had
succeeded
in
terrifying
them
a
certain
method
of
leading
them
wherever
they
thought
proper
these
chiefs
unable
any
longer
to
employ
usefully
those
old
bugbears
the
terms
jacobin
and
decidedly
too
hackneyed
had
furbished
up
the
word
demagogue
these
ringleaders
trained
to
all
sorts
of
schemes
and
manoeuvres
exploited
successfully
the
word
mountain
and
agitated
to
good
purpose
that
startling
and
glorious
souvenir
with
these
few
letters
of
the
alphabet
formed
into
syllables
and
suitably
accented
demagogues
montagnards
partitioners
communists
red
republicans
they
made
wildfires
dance
before
the
eyes
of
the
simple
they
had
found
the
method
of
perverting
the
brains
of
their
colleagues
who
were
so
ingenuous
as
to
swallow
them
whole
so
to
speak
with
a
sort
of
dictionary
wherein
every
expression
made
use
of
by
the
democratic
writers
and
orators
was
readily
translated
for
read
for
read
for
read
for
read
for
read
for
read
to
the
so
that
when
an
orator
of
the
left
exclaimed
for
instance
rush
for
the
suppression
of
war
and
the
abolition
of
the
death
a
crowd
of
poor
souls
on
the
right
distinctly
understood
wish
to
put
everything
to
fire
and
and
in
a
fury
shook
their
fists
at
the
orator
after
such
speeches
in
which
there
had
been
a
question
only
of
liberty
of
universal
peace
of
prosperity
arising
from
labour
of
concord
and
of
progress
the
representatives
of
that
category
which
we
have
designated
at
the
head
of
this
paragraph
were
seen
to
rise
pale
as
death
they
were
not
sure
that
they
were
not
already
guillotined
and
went
to
look
for
their
hats
to
see
whether
they
still
had
heads
these
poor
frightened
creatures
did
not
haggle
over
their
adhesion
to
the
of
december
the
expression
louis
napoleon
has
saved
society
was
invented
especially
for
them
and
those
eternal
prefects
those
eternal
mayors
those
eternal
magistrates
those
eternal
sheriffs
those
eternal
complimenters
of
the
rising
sun
or
of
the
lighted
lamp
who
on
the
day
after
success
flock
to
the
conqueror
to
the

to
the

the

on

the
keys
of
their
consciences
but
imbeciles
is
an
old
story
have
always
made
a
part
of
all
institutions
and
are
almost
an
institution
of
themselves
and
as
for
the
prefects
and
magistrates
as
for
these
adorers
of
every
new
r√©gime
insolent
with
fortune
and
rapidity
they
abound
at
all
times
let
us
do
justice
to
the
r√©gime
of
december
it
can
boast
not
only
of
such
partisans
as
these
but
it
has
creatures
and
adherents
peculiar
to
itself
it
has
produced
an
altogether
new
race
of
notabilities
nations
are
never
conscious
of
all
the
riches
they
possess
in
the
matter
of
knaves
overturnings
and
subversions
of
this
description
are
necessary
to
bring
them
to
light
then
the
nations
wonder
at
what
issues
from
the
dust
it
is
splendid
to
contemplate
one
whose
shoes
and
clothes
and
reputation
were
of
a
sort
to
attract
all
the
dogs
of
europe
in
full
cry
comes
forth
an
ambassador
another
who
had
a
glimpse
of
and
awakes
a
general
and
grand
eagle
of
the
legion
of
honour
every
adventurer
assumes
an
official
costume
furnishes
himself
with
a
good
pillow
stuffed
with
takes
a
sheet
of
white
paper
and
writes
thereon

viii

in
the
centre
is
the
man
the
man
we
have
described
the
man
of
punic
faith
the
fatal
man
attacking
the
civilisation
to
arrive
at
power
seeking
elsewhere
than
amongst
the
true
people
one
knows
not
what
ferocious
popularity
cultivating
the
still
uncivilized
qualities
of
the
peasant
and
the
soldier
endeavouring
to
succeed
by
appealing
to
gross
selfishness
to
brutal
passions
to
newly
awakened
desires
to
excited
appetites
something
like
a
prince
marat
with
nearly
the
same
object
which
in
marat
was
grand
and
in
louis
bonaparte
is
little
the
man
who
kills
who
transports
who
banishes
who
expels
who
proscribes
who
despoils
this
man
with
harassed
gesture
and
glassy
eye
who
walks
with
distracted
air
amid
the
horrible
things
he
does
like
a
sort
of
sinister
somnambulist
it
has
been
said
of
louis
bonaparte
whether
with
friendly
intent
or
otherwise
for
these
strange
beings
have
strange
flatterers
he
is
a
dictator
he
is
a
despot
nothing
more
he
is
that
in
our
opinion
and
he
is
also
something
else
the
dictator
was
a
magistrate
livy
and
cicero
call
him
seneca
calls
him
what
he
decreed
was
looked
upon
as
a
fiat
from
above
livy
says
numine
in
those
times
of
incomplete
civilisation
the
rigidity
of
the
ancient
laws
not
having
foreseen
all
cases
his
function
was
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
people
he
was
the
product
of
this
text
populi
suprema
lex
he
caused
to
be
carried
before
him
the
axes
the
emblems
of
his
power
of
life
and
death
he
was
outside
the
law
and
above
the
law
but
he
could
not
touch
the
law
the
dictatorship
was
a
veil
behind
which
the
law
remained
intact
the
law
was
before
the
dictator
and
after
him
and
it
resumed
its
power
over
him
on
the
cessation
of
his
office
he
was
appointed
for
a
very
short
period
six
months
only
says
livy
but
as
if
this
enormous
power
even
when
freely
conferred
by
the
people
ultimately
weighed
heavily
upon
him
like
remorse
the
dictator
generally
resigned
before
the
end
of
his
term
cincinnatus
gave
it
up
at
the
end
of
eight
days
the
dictator
was
forbidden
to
dispose
of
the
public
funds
without
the
authority
of
the
senate
or
to
go
out
of
italy
he
could
not
even
ride
on
horseback
without
the
permission
of
the
people
he
might
be
a
plebeian
marcius
rutilus
and
publius
philo
were
dictators
that
magistracy
was
created
for
very
different
objects
to
organize
f√™tes
for
saints
days
to
drive
a
sacred
nail
into
the
wall
of
the
temple
of
jupiter
on
one
occasion
to
appoint
the
senate
republican
rome

this
intermittent
institution
continued
for
one
hundred
and
years
from
the
year
of
rome
to
the
year
it
began
with
servilius
geminus
and
reached
c√¶sar
passing
over
sylla
it
expired
with
c√¶sar
the
dictatorship
was
fitted
to
be
repudiated
by
cincinnatus
and
to
be
espoused
by
c√¶sar
c√¶sar
was
five
times
dictator
in
the
course
of
five
years
from
to
this
was
a
dangerous
magistracy

it
ended
by
devouring
liberty

we

no

the

he

hung
upon

his
the
only
discrepancy
is
that
he
makes

unmakes
the
law
according
to
his
own
fancy
he
rides

without
permission

as
to

let
us
pass
to

this
is
the
other
qualification
almost
accepted
by
bonaparte
let
us
speak
for
a
while
the
language
of
the
lower
empire
it
befits
the
subject
the
came
after
the
among
other
attributes
he
was
general
of
the
infantry
and
of
the
cavalry
utriusque
it
was
the
emperor
alexis
surnamed
the
angel
who
created
the
dignity
of
this
officer
was
below
the
emperor
and
above
the
sebastocrator
or
augustus
and
above
the
c√¶sar
it
will
be
seen
that
this
is
somewhat
the
case
with
us
bonaparte
is
if
we
admit
which
is
not
difficult
that
magnan
is
c√¶sar
and
that
maupas
is
augustus
despot
and
dictator
that
is
admitted
but
all
this
great
all
this
triumphant
power
does
not
prevent
little
incidents
from
happening
in
paris
like
the
following
which
honest
witnesses
of
the
fact
will
tell
you
musingly
two
men
were
walking
in
the
street
talking
of
their
business
or
their
private
affairs
one
of
them
referring
to
some
knave
or
other
of
whom
he
thought
he
had
reason
to
complain
exclaimed
he
is
a
wretch
a
swindler
a
rascal
a

agent
who
heard
these
last
words
cried
out

you
are
speaking

wish

the

they

only
to
ask

a
few
questions

unlimited
power
a
man
of
genius
in
eight
months
would
have
changed
the
whole
face
of
france
of
europe
perhaps
he
would
not
certainly
have
effaced
the
crime
of
his
but
he
might
have
covered
it
by
dint
of
material
improvements
he
might
have
succeeded
perhaps
in
masking
from
the
nation
his
moral
abasement
indeed
we
must
admit
that
for
a
dictator
of
genius
the
thing
was
not
difficult
a
certain
number
of
social
problems
elaborated
during
these
last
few
years
by
several
powerful
minds
seemed
to
be
ripe
and
might
receive
immediate
practical
solution
to
the
great
profit
and
satisfaction
of
the
nation
of
this
louis
bonaparte
does
not
appear
to
have
had
any
idea
he
has
not
approached
he
has
not
had
a
glimpse
of
one
of
them
he
has
not
even
found
at
the
√©lys√©e
any
old
remains
of
the
socialist
meditations
of
ham
he
has
added
several
new
crimes
to
his
first
one
and
in
this
he
has
been
logical
with
the
exception
of
these
crimes
he
has
produced
nothing
absolute
power
no
initiative
he
has
taken
france
and
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
in
truth
we
are
tempted
to
pity
this
eunuch
struggling
with
omnipotence
it
is
true
however
that
this
dictator
keeps
in
motion
let
us
do
him
this
justice
he
does
not
remain
quiet
for
an
instant
he
sees
with
affright
the
gloom
and
solitude
around
him
people
sing
who
are
afraid
in
the
dark
but
he
keeps
moving
he
makes
a
fuss
he
goes
at
everything
he
runs
after
projects
being
unable
to
create
he
decrees
he
endeavours
to
mask
his
nullity
he
is
perpetual
motion
but
alas
the
wheel
turns
in
empty
space
conversion
of
of
what
profit
has
it
been
to
this
day
saving
of
eighteen
millions
very
good
the
annuitants
lose
them
but
the
president
and
the
senate
with
their
two
endowments
pocket
them
the
benefit
to
france
is
zero
credit
foncier
no
capital
forthcoming
railways
they
are
decreed
and
then
laid
aside
it
is
the
same
with
all
these
things
as
with
the
cities
louis
bonaparte
subscribes
but
does
not
pay
as
for
the
budget
the
budget
controlled
by
the
blind
men
in
the
council
of
state
and
voted
by
the
dumb
men
in
the
corps
l√©gislatif
there
is
an
abyss
beneath
it
there
was
no
possible
or
efficacious
budget
but
a
great
reduction
in
the
army
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
left
at
home
two
hundred
millions
saved
just
try
to
touch
the
army
the
soldier
who
would
regain
his
freedom
would
applaud
but
what
would
the
officer
say
and
in
reality
it
is
not
the
soldier
but
the
officer
who
is
caressed
then
paris
and
lyons
must
be
guarded
and
all
the
other
cities
and
afterwards
when
we
are
emperor
a
little
european
war
must
be
got
up
behold
the
gulf
if
from
financial
questions
we
pass
to
political
institutions
oh
there
the
flourish
abundantly
there
are
the
creations
good
heavens
what
creations
a
constitution
in
the
style
of
ravrio
we
have
been
examining
it
ornamented
with
and
swans
necks
borne
to
the
√©lys√©e
with
old
in
the
carriages
of
the
the
conservative
senate
restitched
and
regilded
the
council
of
state
of
refurbished
and
with
fresh
lace
the
old
corps
l√©gislatif
patched
up
with
new
nails
and
fresh
paint
minus
lain√©
and
plus
morny
in
lieu
of
liberty
of
the
press
the
bureau
of
public
spirit
in
place
of
individual
liberty
the
ministry
of
police
all
these
institutions
which
we
have
passed
in
review
are
nothing
more
than
the
old
salon
furniture
of
the
empire
beat
it
dust
it
sweep
away
the
cobwebs
splash
it
over
with
stains
of
french
blood
and
you
have
the
establishment
of
this
governs
france
these
are
the
creations
where
is
common
sense
where
is
reason
where
is
truth
not
a
sound
side
of
contemporary
intelligence
that
has
not
received
a
shock
not
a
just
conquest
of
the
age
that
has
not
been
thrown
down
and
broken
all
sorts
of
extravagance
become
possible
all
that
we
have
seen
since
the
of
december
is
a
gallop
through
all
that
is
absurd
of
a
commonplace
man
broken
loose
these
individuals
the
malefactor
and
his
accomplices
are
in
possession
of
immense
incomparable
absolute
unlimited
power
sufficient
we
repeat
to
change
the
whole
face
of
europe
they
make
use
of
it
only
for
amusement
to
enjoy
and
to
enrich
themselves
such
is
their
socialism
they
have
stopped
the
budget
on
the
public
highway
the
coffers
are
open
they
fill
their
they
have
money
do
you
want
some
here
you
are
all
the
salaries
are
doubled
or
trebled

x
the

profiles
of

the
curious
part
of
it
is
that
they
are
desirous
of
being
respected
a
general
is
venerable
a
minister
is
sacred
the
countess
a
young
woman
of
brussels
was
at

was
one
day
in

salon
in

de
entered
madame

she
went
out

before
him
and
it
happened
that
thinking
probably
of
something
else
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
de
noticed
it
the
following
day
madame
was
apprised
that
henceforward
under
pain
of
being
expelled
from
france
like
a
representative
of
the
people
she
must
abstain
from
every
mark
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
when
she
happened
to
meet
a
minister
under
this
and
under
this
everything
proceeds
in
military
form
the
french
people
consult
the
order
of
the
day
to
know
how
they
must
get
up
how
they
must
go

how
they
must
dress
in
what
toilette
they
may
go

such
is
the
yoke
under
which
bows
at
this
moment
the
nation
of
initiative
and
of
liberty
the
great
revolutionary
france
the
reformer
will
not
stop
until
france
shall
be
enough
of
a
barrack
for
the

to
exclaim

of

a
young

returning
from
a
ball
passed
through
rue
de

before
the
gate
of
the
national
library
the
sentinel
took
aim
at
him
and
killed
him
the
journals
of
the
following
morning
said
the
young
man
is
dead
and
there
it
ended
timour
bey
granted
to
his
and
to
their
descendants
to
the
seventh
generation
impunity
for
all
crimes
whatsoever
provided
the
delinquent
had
not
committed
a
crime
nine
times
the
sentinel
of
rue
richelieu
has
therefore
eight
citizens
more
to
kill
before
he
can
be
brought
before
a
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
a
soldier
but
not
so
good
to
be
a
citizen
at
the
same
time
however
this
unfortunate
army
is
dishonoured
on
the
of
december
they
decorated
the
police
officers
who
arrested
its
representatives
and
its
generals
though
it
is
equally
true
that
the
soldiers
themselves
received
two
louis
per
man
oh
shame
on
every
side
money
to
the
soldiers
and
the
cross
to
the
police
spies
these
three
colonels
are
mm
cailhassou
dubarry
and
policarpe
jesuitism
and
corporalism
this
is
the
sum
total
of
the
regime
the
whole
political
theory
of
bonaparte
is
composed
of
two
hypocrisies
a
military
hypocrisy
towards
the
army
a
catholic
hypocrisy
towards
the
clergy
when
it
is
not
it
is
sometimes
it
is
both
together
in
this
manner
he
succeeded
wonderfully
in
duping
at
the
same
time
montalembert
who
does
not
believe
in
france
and
who
does
not
believe
in
god
does
the
dictator
smell
of
incense
does
he
smell
of
tobacco
smell
and
see
he
smells
of
both
tobacco
and
incense
oh
france
what
a
government
is
this
the
spurs
pass
by
beneath
the
cassock
the
goes
to
mass
thrashes
the
civilians
reads
its
breviary
embraces
catin
tells
its

empties
the
wine
pots
and
takes
the
sacrament
the
asserts
what
is
doubtful
that
we
have
gone
back
to
the
time
of
the
but
this
much
is
certain
that
it
takes
us
back
to
the
time
of
the
crusades
c√¶sar
goes
crusading
for
the
pope
el
the
√©lys√©e
has
the
faith
and
the
thirst
also
of
the
templar
to
enjoy
and
to
live
well
we
repeat
and
to
consume
the
budget
to
believe
nothing
to
make
the
most
of
everything
to
compromise
at
once
two
sacred
things
military
honour
and
religious
faith
to
stain
the
altar
with
blood
and
the
standard
with
holy
water
to
make
the
soldier
ridiculous
and
the
priest
a
little
ferocious
to
mix
up
with
that
great
political
fraud
which
he
calls
his
power
the
church
and
the
nation
the
conscience
of
the
catholic
and
the
conscience
of
the
patriot
this
is
the
system
of
bonaparte
the
little
all
his
acts
from
the
most
monstrous
to
the
most
puerile
from
that
which
is
hideous
to
that
which
is
laughable
are
stamped
with
this
twofold
scheme
for
instance
national
solemnities
bore
him
the
of
february
and
the
of
may
these
are
disagreeable
or
dangerous
reminders
which
obstinately
return
at
fixed
periods
an
anniversary
is
an
intruder
let
us
suppress
anniversaries
so
be
it
we
will
keep
but
one
birthday
our
own
excellent
but
with
one
f√™te
only
how
are
two
parties
to
be
satisfied
the
soldier
party
and
the
priest
party
the
soldier
party
is
voltairian
where
canrobert
smiles
riancey
makes
a
wry
face
what
to
be
done
you
shall
see
your
great
jugglers
are
not
embarrassed
by
such
a
trifle
the
one
fine
morning
declares
that
there
will
be
henceforth
but
one
national
f√™te
the
of
august
hereupon
a
commentary
the
two
masks
of
the
dictator

to
speak
the
of

saint
napoleon
day
the
of
august
says
the
mouth
the
f√™te
of
the
holy
virgin
on
one
side
the
puffs
out
its
cheeks
magnifies
its
voice
draws
its
long
sabre
and
exclaims
grumblers
let
us
celebrate
the
birthday
of
napoleon
the
great
on
the
other
it
casts
down
its
eyes
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
mumbles
my
very
dear
brethren
let
us
adore
the
sacred
heart
of
mary
the
present
government
is
a
hand
stained
with
blood
which
dips
a
finger
in
the
holy
water
xi
recapitulation
but
we
are
asked
are
you
going
a
little
too
far
are
you
not
unjust
grant
him
something
has
he
not
to
a
certain
extent
socialism
and
the
credit
foncier
the
railroads
and
the
lowering
of
the
interest
are
brought
upon
the
carpet
we
have
already
estimated
these
measures
at
their
proper
value
but
while
we
admit
that
this
is
socialism
you
would
be
simpletons
to
ascribe
the
credit
to
bonaparte
it
is
not
he
who
has
made
socialism
but
time
a
man
is
swimming
against
a
rapid
current
he
struggles
with
efforts
he
buffets
the
waves
with
hand
and
head
and
shoulder
and
knee
you
say
he
will
succeed
in
going
up
a
moment
after
you
look
and
he
has
gone
farther
down
he
is
much
farther
down
the
river
than
he
was
when
he
started
without
knowing
or
even
suspecting
it
he
loses
ground
at
every
effort
he
makes
he
fancies
that
he
is
ascending
the
stream
and
he
is
constantly
descending
it
he
thinks
he
is
advancing
but
he
is
falling
hack
falling
credit
as
you
say
lowering
of
interest
as
you
say
bonaparte
has
already
made
several
of
those
decrees
which
you
choose
to
qualify
as
socialistic
and
he
will
make
more
changarnier
had
he
triumphed
instead
of
bonaparte
would
have
done
as
much
henry
v
should
he
return
would
do
the
same
the
emperor
of
austria
does
it
in
galicia
and
the
emperor
nicholas
in
lithuania
but
after
all
what
does
this
prove
that
the
torrent
which
is
called
revolution
is
stronger
than
the
swimmer
who
is
called
despotism
but
even
this
socialism
of
bonaparte
what
is
it
this
socialism
i
deny
it
hatred
of
the
middle
class
it
may
be
but
not
socialism
look
at
the
socialist
department
the
department
of
agriculture
and
of
commerce
he
has
abolished
it
what
has
he
given
you
as
compensation
the
ministry
of
police
the
other
socialist
department
is
the
department
of
public
instruction
and
that
is
in
danger
one
of
these
days
it
will
be
suppressed
the
of
socialism
is
education
gratuitous
and
obligatory
teaching
knowledge
to
take
the
children
and
make
men
of
them
to
take
the
men
and
make
citizens
of
them
intelligent
honest
useful
and
happy
citizens
intellectual
and
moral
progress
first
and
material
progress
after
the
two
first
irresistibly
and
of
themselves
bring
on
the
last
what
does
bonaparte
do
he
persecutes
and
stifles
instruction
everywhere
there
is
one
pariah
in
our
france
of
the
present
day
and
that
is
the
schoolmaster
have
you
ever
reflected
on
what
a
schoolmaster
really
is
on
that
magistracy
in
which
the
tyrants
of
old
took
shelter
like
criminals
in
the
temple
a
certain
refuge
have
you
ever
thought
of
what
that
man
is
who
teaches
children
you
enter
the
workshop
of
a
wheelwright
he
is
making
wheels
and
shafts
you
say
this
is
a
useful
man
you
enter
a
weaver
who
is
making
cloth
you
say
this
is

is
a

in

would
have
been
a
vagabond
this
much
being
granted
that
the
dictionary
of

no

that

is
a
chimera
that
history
is
a

that
the

was
a
vagabond
and
the
duke
of
alva
a
just
man
that
louis
bonaparte
is
identical
with
napoleon
the
great
that
they
who
have
violated
the
constitution
are
saviours
and
that
they
who
defended
it
are
brigands
in
a
word
that
human

is
dead
very
good
in

i
admire
this

it
works

it
is

it
compresses
it
represses
it
oppresses
it
imprisons

all
these

constitute
after
all
a

stable
we
have
already
expressed
ourselves
on
the
subject
of
this

stability
i
admire
such
stability
if
it
rained

in
france
for
two
days
only
on
the
morning
of
the
third
nobody
would
know
what
had
become
of
louis
bonaparte
no
matter
this
man
is
a
burden
upon
the
whole
age
he
disfigures
the
nineteenth
century
and
there
will
be
in
this
century
perhaps
two
or
three
years
upon
which
it
will
be
recognised
by
some
shameful
mark
or
other
that
louis
bonaparte
sat
down
upon
them
this
person
we
grieve
to
say
it
is
now
the
question
that
occupies
all
mankind
at
certain
epochs
in
history
the
whole
human
race
from
all
points
of
the
earth
fix
their
eyes
upon
some
mysterious
spot
whence
it
seems
that
universal
destiny
is
about
to
issue
there

hours

species

that
whence
no

what
sort

that
wherein
reside
all
kinds

all
kinds
of

what
sort

is
that
where
bishops
elbow

as
a
hundred

bow
to
the
ground
before

where
samuel

weeping

what
sort

the

c√¶sarion
with
his

walks
under

very
trees

in
those
very
avenues
still
haunted
by
the
indignant
phantom
of

that
place
is
the
blot
upon
paris
that
place
is
the
pollution
of
the

that
door
whence
issue
all
sorts
of
joyous
sounds
flourishes
of
trumpets
music
laughter
and
the
jingling
of
glasses
that
door
saluted
during
the
day
by
the
passing
battalions
illuminated
at

thrown
wide
open
with
insolent
confidence
is
a
sort
of
public
insult
always
present
there
is
the
centre
of

shame
alas
of
what
is
france
thinking
of
a

we
must
awake
this
slumbering
nation
we
must
take
it
by

arm
we
must
shake
it
we
must
speak
to
it
we
must
scour

enter

go
into
the
barracks
speak
to
the
soldier
who
no

knows
what
he
is

who
has
in
his

an
engraving
of

who
for
that
reason
votes
for
everything
they
ask
we
must
remove
the
radiant
phantom
that
dazzles
their

this
whole

is
nothing

a

we

probe
it
to

disabuse
the

the

people
above
all
excite

agitate
them
stir

up
show

the

the

let
us
sum
up
this

what
do
you
complain
you
have
the
better

the

but
this
government
this
horrible
hypocritical
and
stupid
government
this
government
which
causes
us
to
hesitate
between
a
laugh
and
a
sob
this
on
which
all
our
liberties
are
hung
this
great
universal
suffrage
and
this
little
universal
suffrage
the
first
naming
the
president
and
the
other
the
legislators
the
little
one
saying
to
the
great
one
accept
these
and
the
great
one
saying
to
the
little
one
assured
of
my
this
senate
this
council
of
state
whence
do
they
all
come
great
heaven
have
we
already
reached
the
point
that
it
is
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
of
their
source
whence
comes
this
government
look
it
is
still
flowing
it
is
still
smoking
it
is
blood
the
dead
are
far
away
the
dead
are
dead
ah
it
is
horrible
to
think
and
to
say
but
is
it
possible
that
we
no
longer
think
of
it
is
it
possible
that
because
we
still
eat
and
drink
because
the
coachmakers
trade
is
flourishing
because
you
labourer
have
work
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
because
you
mason
earn
forty
sous
a
day
at
the
louvre
because
you
banker
have
made
money
in
the
mining
shares
of
vienna
or
in
the
obligations
of
hope
and
because
the
titles
of
nobility
are
restored
because
one
can
now
be
called
le
or
la
because
religious
processions
traverse
the
streets
on
the
because
people
enjoy
themselves
because
they
laugh
because
the
walls
of
paris
are
covered
with
bills
of
f√™tes
and
theatres
is
it
possible
that
because
these
things
are
so
men
forgot
that
there
are
corpses
lying
beneath
is
it
possible
that
because
one
has
been
to
the
ball
at
the
√©cole
militaire
because
one
has
returned
home
with
dazzled
eyes
aching
head
torn
dress
and
faded
bouquet
because
one
has
thrown
one
self
on
one
couch
and
fallen
asleep
thinking
of
some
handsome
officer
is
it
possible
that
one
no
longer
remembers
that
under
the
turf
in
an
obscure
grave
in
a
deep
pit
in
the
inexorable
gloom
of
death
there
lies
a
motionless
terrible
multitude
a
multitude
of
human
beings
already
become
a
shapeless
mass
devoured
by
worms
consumed
by
corruption
and
beginning
to
blend
with
the
earth
around
them
who
existed
worked
thought
and
loved
who
had
the
right
to
live
and
who
were
murdered
ah
if
men
recollect
this
no
longer
let
us
recall
it
to
the
minds
of
those
who
forget
awake
you
who
sleep
the
dead
are
about

your

extract
from
an
unpublished
book
entitled
the
crime
of
the
second
of
december
the
day
of
the
of
december
the
coup
at
bay
by
victor
hugo
this
book
will
shortly
be
published
it
will
be
a
complete
narrative
of
the
infamous
performance
of
a
large
part
of
it
is
already
written
the
author
is
at
this
moment
collecting
materials
for
the
rest
he
deems
it
apropos
to
enter
somewhat
at
length
into
the
details
of
this
work
which
he
has
imposed
upon
himself
as
a
duty
the
author
does
himself
the
justice
to
believe
that
in
writing
this
narrative
the
serious
occupation
of
his
exile
he
has
had
constantly
present
to
his
mind
the
exalted
responsibility
of
the
historian
when
it
shall
appear
this
narrative
will
surely
arouse
numerous
and
violent
outcries
the
author
expects
no
less
one
does
not
with
impunity
cut
to
the
quick
of
a
contemporaneous
crime
at
the
moment
when
that
crime
is
omnipotent
however
that
may
be
and
however
violent
the
outcries
more
or
less
interested
and
to
the
end
that
we
may
judge
beforehand
of
its
merit
the
author
feels
called
upon
to
explain
in
what
way
and
with
what
scrupulous
devotion
to
the
truth
this
narrative
will
have
been
written
or
to
speak
more
accurately
this
report
of
the
crime
will
have
been
drawn
this
history
of
the
of
december
will
contain
in
addition
to
the
general
facts
which
everybody
knows
a
very
large
number
of
unknown
facts
which
are
brought
to
light
for
the
first
time
therein
several
of
these
facts
the
author
himself
saw
and
touched
and
passed
through
of
them
he
can
say
ipse
vidi
et
quorum
pars
the
members
of
the
republican
left
whose
conduct
was
so
fearless
saw
these
facts
as
he
did
and
he
will
not
lack
their
testimony
for
all
the
rest
the
author
has
resorted
to
a
veritable
judicial
investigation
he
has
constituted
himself
so
to
speak
the
examining
magistrate
of
the
performance
every
actor
in
the
drama
every
combatant
every
victim
every
witness
has
deposed
before
him
for
all
the
doubtful
facts
he
has
brought
the
opposing
declarations
and
at
need
the
witnesses
face
to
face
as
a
general
rule
historians
deal
with
dead
facts
they
touch
them
in
the
tomb
with
their
judicial
wands
cause
them
to
rise
and
question
them
he
has
dealt
with
living
facts
all
the
details
of
the
of
december
have
in
this
wise
passed
before
his
eyes
he
has
recorded
them
all
weighed
them
all
not
one
has
escaped
him
history
will
be
able
to
complete
this
narration
but
not
to
weaken
it
the
magistrates
were
recreant
to
their
trust
he
has
performed
their
functions
when
direct
spoken
testimony
has
failed
him
he
has
sent
to
the
spot
what
one
might
call
genuine
investigating
commissions
he
might
cite
many
a
fact
for
which
he
has
prepared
genuine
interrogatories
to
which
detailed
replies
were
made
he
repeats
that
he
has
subjected
the
of
december
to
a
long
and
severe
examination
he
has
carried
the
torch
so
far
as
he
was
able
thanks
to
this
investigation
he
has
in
his
possession
nearly
two
hundred
reports
from
which
the
book
in
question
will
emerge
there
is
not
a
single
fact
beneath
which
when
the
book
is
published
the
author
will
not
be
able
to
put
a
name
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
he
will
abstain
from
doing
so
that
he
will
even
substitute
sometimes
for
the
real
names
yes
and
for
accurate
indications
of
places
designations
as
obscure
as
possible
in
view
of
the
pending
proscriptions
he
has
no
desire
to
furnish
bonaparte
with
a
supplemental
list
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
in
this
narrative
of
the
of
december
the
author
is
not
any
more
than
in
this
present
book
impartial
as
people
are
accustomed
to
say
of
a
history
when
they
wish
to
praise
the
historian
impartiality
a
strange
virtue
which
tacitus
does
not
possess
woe
to
him
who
should
remain
impartial
in
face
of
the
bleeding
wounds
of
liberty
in
presence
of
the
deed
of
december
the
author
feels
that
all
human
nature
rises
to
arms
within
his
breast
he
does
not
conceal
it
from
himself
and
every
one
should
perceive
it
when
reading
him
but
in
him
the
passion
for
truth
equals
the
passion
for
right
the
wrathful
man
does
not
lie
this
history
of
the
of
december
therefore
he
declares
as
he
is
about
to
quote
a
few
pages
of
it
will
have
been
written
we
have
just
seen
by
what
method
under
conditions
of
the
most
absolute
reality
we
deem
it
profitable
to
detach
from
it
and
to
publish
in
this
place
a
chapter
which
we
think
will
make
an
impression
on
minds
in
that
it
casts
a
new
light
on
the
success
of
bonaparte
thanks
to
the
judicious
reticences
of
the
official
historiographers
of
the
of
december
people
are
not
sufficiently
apprised
how
near
the
came
to
being
abortive
and
they
are
altogether
ignorant
as
to
the
means
by
which
it
was
saved
we
proceed
to
place
this
special
detail
before
the
reader
eyes
the
author
has
concluded
to
reserve
for
this
book
alone
the
chapter
in
question
which
now
forms
an
integral
part
thereof
he
has
therefore
rewritten
for
the
of
a
the
narrative
of
the
events
of
december
with
new
facts
and
from
another
point
of
view
i
the
resistance
had
assumed
unexpected
proportions
the
combat
had
become
menacing
it
was
no
longer
a
combat
but
a
battle
which
was
engaged
on
all
sides
at
the
√©lys√©e
and
the
different
departments
people
began
to
turn
pale
they
had
wished
for
barricades
and
they
had
got
them
all
the
centre
of
paris
was
becoming
covered
with
improvised
redoubts
the
quarters
thus
barricaded
formed
a
sort
of
immense
trapezium
between
the
halles
and
rue
rambuteau
on
one
side
and
the
boulevards
on
the
other
bounded
on
the
east
by
rue
du
temple
and
on
the
west
by
rue
montmartre
this
vast
network
of
streets
cut
in
all
directions
by
redoubts
and
entrenchments
assumed
every
hour
a
more
terrible
aspect
and
was
becoming
a
kind
of
fortress
the
combatants
at
the
barricades
pushed
their
advance
guards
as
far
as
the
quays
outside
the
trapezium
which
we
have
described
the
barricades
extended
as
we
have
said
as
far
as
faubourg
and
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
canal
the
quarter
of
the
schools
whither
the
committee
of
resistance
had
despatched
representative
de
flotte
had
risen
even
more
generally
than
on
the
evening
before
the
suburbs
were
taking
fire
the
drums
were
beating
to
arms
at
the
batignolles
madier
de
montjau
was
arousing
belleville
three
enormous
barricades
were
in
course
of
construction
at
the
in
the
business
streets
the
citizens
were
delivering
up
their
muskets
and
the
women
were
making
lint
is
going
well
paris
is
up
exclaimed
b
to
us
as
he
entered
the
committee
of
resistance
with
a
face
radiant
with
joy
fresh
intelligence
reached
us
every
instant
all
the
permanent
committees
of
the
different
quarters
placed
themselves
in
communication
with
us
the
members
of
the
committee
deliberated
and
issued
orders
and
instructions
for
the
combat
in
every
direction
victory
seemed
certain
there
was
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
and
joy
when
all
these
men
still
standing
between
life
and
death
embraced
one
exclaimed
jules
favre
but
a
regiment
come
over
or
a
legion
and
louis
bonaparte
is
lost
the
republic
will
be
at
the
hotel
de

said
michel
de
bourges
all
was
ferment
all
was
excitement
in
the
most
peaceful
quarters
the
proclamations
were
torn
down
and
the
ordinances
defaced
on
rue
beaubourg
the
women
cried
from
the
windows
to
the
men
employed
in
erecting
a
barricade
the
agitation
reached
even
to
faubourg
at
the
headquarters
on
rue
de
jerusalem
which
is
the
centre
of
the
great
cobweb
that
the
police
spreads
over
paris
everyone
trembled
their
anxiety
was
immense
for
they
saw
the
possibility
that
the
republic
would
triumph
in
the
courtyards
in
the
bureaus
and
in
the
passages
the
clerks
and
began
to
talk
with
affectionate
regret
of
caussidiere
a
committee
of

charged
with
the
task
of
centralizing
the
action
and
directing
the
combat

been
named
on
the
evening
of
the
of

this
committee
which
was
obliged
to
change
its
retreat
times
in
four
days
and
which
so
to
say
sat
night
and
day
and
did
not
cease
to
act

if
one
can
believe
what
has
oozed
out
from
this
den
the
prefect
maupas
who
had
been
so
warm
in
the
cause
the
evening
before
and
was
put
forward
so
odiously
began
to
back
out
and
lose
courage
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
listening
with
terror
to
the
noise
as
of
a
rising
flood
made
by
the
insurrection
by
the
holy
and
legitimate
insurrection
of
the
right
he
stammered
and
hesitated
while
the
word
of
command
died
away
upon
his
tongue
poor
young
man
has
the
colic
said
the
former
prefect
carlier
on
leaving
him
in
this
state
of
consternation
maupas
clung
to
morny
the
electric
telegraph
maintained
a
perpetual
dialogue
from
the
prefecture
of
police
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
from
the
department
of
the
interior
to
the
prefecture
of
police
all
the
most
alarming
news
all
the
signs
of
panic
and
confusion
were
passed
on
one
after
another
from
the
prefect
to
the
minister
morny
who
was
less
frightened
and
who
is
at
least
a
man
of
spirit
received
all
these
shocks
in
his
cabinet
it
is
reported
that
at
the
first
communication
he
said
is
ill
and
to
the
question
is
to
be
done
replied
by
the
telegraph
to
bed
to
the
second
question
he
still
replied
to
bed
and
as
the
third
losing
all
patience
he
answered
to
bed
and
be
d
d
the
zeal
of
the
government
agents
was
fast
giving
way
and
beginning
to
change
sides
a
courageous
man
who
had
been
despatched
by
the
committee
of
resistance
to
rouse
faubourg
was
arrested
on
rue
des
with
his
pockets
filled
with
the
proclamations
and
decrees
of
the
left
he
was
immediately
marched
off
in
the
direction
of
the
prefecture
of
police
he
expected
to
be
shot
as
the
escort
which
was
conducting
him
passed
the
morgue
on
were
heard
in
the
cit√©
the
at
the
head
of
the
escort
said
to
the
soldiers
back
to
your
i
will
take
care
of
the
prisoner
as
soon
as
the
soldiers
were
gone
he
cut
the
cords
with
which
the
hands
were
fastened
and
said
to
him
i
spare
your
life
forget
that
it
was
i
who
set
you
at
liberty
look
at
me
well
so
that
you
may
know
me
again
the
principal
military
accomplices
held
a
council
the
question
was
discussed
whether
it
was
not
necessary
for
louis
bonaparte
to
quit
faubourg
immediately
and
remove
either
to
the
invalides
or
to
the
palais
du
luxembourg
two
strategic
points
more
easy
to
defend
against
a
de
than
the
√©lys√©e
some
preferred
the
invalides
others
the
luxembourg
the
subject
gave
rise
to
an
altercation
between
two
generals
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
of
westphalia
j√©r√¥me
bonaparte
seeing
that
the
was
tottering
to
its
fall
and
having
some
care
for
the
morrow
wrote
his
nephew
the
following
significant
letter
my
dear
nephew
the
blood
of
frenchmen
has
been
spilt
stop
its
effusion
by
a
serious
appeal
to
the
people
your
sentiments
are
not
rightly
understood
your
second
proclamation
in
which
you
speak
of
the
plebiscitum
is
ill
received
by
the
people
who
do
not
look
upon
it
as
the
right
of
suffrage
liberty
possesses
no
guarantee
if
there
is
not
an
assembly
to
contribute
to
the
constitution
of
the
republic
the
army
has
the
upper
hand
now
is
the
moment
to
complete
the
material
victory
by
a
moral
victory
and
that
which
a
government
can
not
do
when
beaten
it
ought
to
do
when
victorious
after
destroying
the
old
parties
bring
about
the
restoration
of
the
people
proclaim
that
universal
suffrage
sincere
and
acting
in
harmony
with
the
greatest
liberty
shall
name
the
president
and
the
constituent
assembly
to
save
and
restore
the
republic
it
is
in
the
name
of
my
brother
memory
and
sharing
his
horror
for
civil
war
that
i
now
write
to
you
trust
my
long
experience
and
remember
that
france
europe
and
posterity
will
be
called
on
to
judge
your
conduct
your
affectionate
uncle
j√©r√¥me
bonaparte
on
place
de
la
madeleine
the
two
representatives
fabvier
and
crestin
met
and
accosted
each
other
general
fabvier
directed
his
colleague
attention
to
four
pieces
of
cannon
which
turning
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
they
had
before
been
pursuing
left
the
boulevard
and
galloped
off
towards
the
√©lys√©e
it
be
that
the
√©lys√©e
is
already
on
the
defensive
said
the
general
crestin
pointing
to
the
fa√ßade
of
the
palate
of
the
assembly
on
the
other
side
of
place
de
la
r√©volution
replied
we
shall
be
there
from
some
garrets
that
look
on
the
stables
of
the
√©lys√©e
three
travelling
carriages
were
observed
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
loaded
with
the
horses
put
to
and
the
postilions
in
their
saddles
ready
to
start
the
impulsion
was
really
given
the
movement
of
rage
and
hatred
was
becoming
universal
and
the
seemed
to
be
lost
one
shock
more
and
louis
bonaparte
would
fall
let
the
day
but
end
as
it
had
begun
and
all
was
over
the
was
approaching
a
state
of
despair
the
hour
for
supreme
resolutions
was
come
what
did
he
intend
doing
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
strike
a
great
blow
an
unexpected
blow
a
terrible
blow
he
was
reduced
to
this
alternative
to
perish
or
to
save
himself
by
a
frightful
expedient
louis
bonaparte
had
not
quitted
the
√©lys√©e
he
was
in
a
cabinet
on
the
ground
floor
near
the
splendid
gilt
saloon
where
as
a
child
in
he
had
been
present
at
the
second
abdication
of
napoleon
he
was
there
alone
orders
had
been
given
that
no
one
should
be
allowed
to
have
access
to
him
from
time
to
time
the
door
was
opened
a
little
way
and
the
grey
head
of
general
roguet
his
appeared
the
general
was
the
only
person
who
was
allowed
to
open
this
door
and
enter
the
room
the
general
brought
news
more
and
more
alarming
and
frequently
terminated
what
he
had
to
say
with
the
words
thing
does
work
or
are
going
badly
when
he
had
finished
louis
bonaparte
who
was
seated
with
his
elbows
on
a
table
and
his
feet
on
the
before
a
roaring
fire
turned
his
head
half
round
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
in
a
most
phlegmatic
tone
and
without
apparent
emotion
invariably
answered
in
the
following
words
them
execute
my
orders
the
last
time
that
general
roguet
entered
the
room
in
this
manner
with
bad
news
it
was
nearly
one
he
himself
has
related
these
details
to
the
honour
of
his
master
calmness
he
told
the
prince
that
the
barricades
in
the
centre
of
the
town
still
held
out
and
were
increasing
in
number
that
on
the
boulevards
the
cries
of
with
the
dictator
he
did
not
dare
say
with
soulouque
and
hisses
everywhere
hailed
the
troops
as
they
passed
that
before
galerie
jouffroy
a
major
had
been
pursued
by
the
crowd
and
that
at
the
corner
of
the
caf√©
cardinal
a
captain
of
the
staff
had
been
torn
from
his
horse
louis
bonaparte
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gazing
fixedly
at
the
general
calmly
said
to
him
well
let
be
told
to
execute
my
orders
what
were
these
orders
we
shall
see
here
we
pause
to
reflect
and
the
narrator
lays
down
his
pen
with
a
species
of
hesitation
and
distress
of
mind
we
are
approaching
the
abominable
crisis
of
that
mournful
day
the
we
are
approaching
that
monstrous
deed
from
which
emerged
the
success
of
the
dripping
with
blood
we
are
about
to
unveil
the
most
horrible
of
the
premeditated
acts
of
louis
bonaparte
we
are
about
to
reveal
to
narrate
to
describe
what
all
the
historiographers
of
the
of
december
have
concealed
what
general
magnan
carefully
omitted
in
his
report
what
even
at
paris
where
these
things
were
seen
men
scarcely
dare
to
whisper
to
each
other
we
are
about
to
enter
upon
the
ghastly
the
of
december
is
a
crime
covered
with
darkness
a
coffin
closed
and
silent
from
the
cracks
in
which
streams
of
blood
gush
forth
we
are
about
to
raise
the
ii
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
for
here
we
insist
upon
this
point
premeditation
is
unquestionable
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
strange
placards
had
been
posted
up
at
all
the
we
have
transcribed
these
placards
and
our
readers
will
remember
them
during
sixty
years
that
the
cannon
of
revolution
have
on
certain
days
boomed
through
paris
and
that
the
government
when
menaced
has
had
recourse
to
desperate
measures
nothing
has
ever
been
seen
like
these
placards
they
informed
the
inhabitants
that
all
assemblages
no
matter
of
what
kind
would
be
dispersed
by
armed
force
previous
in
paris
the
metropolis
of
civilization
people
do
not
easily
believe
that
a
man
will
push
his
crime
to
the
last
extremity
and
therefore
these
notices
had
been
looked
upon
as
a
means
of
intimidation
that
was
hideous
and
barbarous
but
almost
ridiculous
the
public
were
wrong
these
placards
contained
in
germ
louis
bonaparte
whole
plan
they
were
seriously
meant
one
word
as
to
the
spot
which
is
about
to
be
the
theatre
of
the
drama
prepared
and
perpetrated
by
the
man
of
december
from
the
madeleine
to
faubourg
poissonni√®re
the
boulevard
was
unobstructed
from
the
gymnase
theatre
to
the
theatre
of
the
porte
it
was
barricaded
as
were
rue
de
bondy
rue
neslay
rue
de
la
lune
and
all
the

which
bound
or
debouch
at

and
porte
beyond
porte
the
boulevard
was
again
free
as
far
as
the
bastile
with
the
exception
of
a
single
barricade
which
had
been
begun
opposite
the
ch√¢teau
between
porte
and
porte
seven
or
eight
redoubts
crossed
the
street
at
intervals
a
square
of
four
barricades
shut
in
porte
of
these
four
barricades
that
one
which
looked
towards
the
madeleine
and
which
was
destined
to
receive
the
first
impact
of
the
troops
had
been
constructed
at
the
culminating
point
of
the
boulevard
with
its
left
resting
on
the
corners
of
rue
de
la
lune
and
its
right
on
rue
mazagran
four
omnibuses
five
vans
the
office
of
the
inspector
of
hackney
coaches
which
had
been
thrown
down
the
vespasian
columns
which
had
been
broken
up
the
public
seats
on
the
boulevards
the
of
the
steps
on
rue
de
la
lune
the
entire
iron
railing
of
the
sidewalk
which
had
been
wrenched
from
its
place
at
a
single
effort
by
the
powerful
hand
of
the
crowd
such
was
the
composition
of
this
fortification
which
was
hardly
sufficient
to
block
the
boulevard
which
at
this
point
is
very
broad
there
were
no
as
the
roadway
is
macadamized
the
barricade
did
not
even
extend
from
one
side
of
the
boulevard
to
the
other
but
left
a
large
open
space
on
the
side
toward
rue
mazagran
where
there
was
a
house
in
course
of
erection
observing
this
gap
a
young
man
got
upon
the
scaffolding
and
quite
unaided
without
the
least
hurry
without
even
taking
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
cut
all
the
ropes
of
the
scaffolding
the
people
at
the
neighbouring
windows
laughed
and
applauded
him
an
instant
afterwards
the
scaffolding
fell
all
at
once
and
with
a
loud
noise
this
completed
the
barricade
while
this
redoubt
was
being
completed
a
score
or
more
of
men
entered
the
gymnase
theatre
by
the
and
came
out
a
few
seconds
later
with
some
muskets
and
a
drum
which
they
had
found
in
the
wardrobe
and
which
were
a
part
of
what
in
theatrical
language
are
termed
properties
one
of
the
men
took
the
drum
and
began
beating
to
arms
the
others
with
the
overturned
vespasian
columns
carriages
thrown
on
their
sides
blinds
and
shutters
torn
from
their
hinges
and
old
scenery
constructed
opposite
the
of
boulevard
a
small
barricade
as
a
sort
of
advanced
post
or
rather
a
lunette
which
commanded
boulevards
poissonni√®re
and
montmartre
as
well
as
rue
hauteville
the
troops
had
evacuated
the
in
the
morning
they
took
the
flag
belonging
to
it
and
planted
it
on
the
barricade
it
was
this
same
flag
which
was
afterwards
declared
by
the
newspapers
of
the
to
have
been
a
flag
some
fifteen
men
took
up
their
position
at
this
advanced
post
they
had
muskets
but
no
cartridges
or
at
most
very
few
behind
them
the
large
barricade
which
covered
porte
was
held
by
about
a
hundred
combatants
in
the
midst
of
whom
were
observed
two
women
and
an
old
man
with
white
hair
supporting
himself
on
a
cane
with
his
left
hand
and
in
his
right
holding
a
musket
one
of
the
two
women
wore
a
sabre
suspended
over
her
shoulder
while
helping
to
tear
up
the
railing
of
the
sidewalk
she
had
cut
three
fingers
of
her
right
hand
with
the
sharp
edge
of
an
iron
bar
she
showed
the
wound
to
the
crowd
crying
la
r√©publique
the
other
woman
had
ascended
to
the
top
of
the
barricade
where
leaning
on
the
and
escorted
by
two
men
in
blouses
who
were
armed
with
muskets
and
presented
arms
she
read
aloud
the
call
to
arms
issued
by
the
representatives
of
the
left
the
crowd
clapped
their
hands
all
this
occurred
between
noon
and
one
on
this
side
of
the
barricades
an
immense
number
of
people
covered
the
pavement
on
both
sides
of
the
boulevard
in
some
places
silent
in
others
crying
with
soulouque
down
with
the
traitor
from
time
to
time
mournful
processions
traversed
the
multitude
they
consisted
of
files
of
closed
litters
borne
by
hospital
attendants
and
soldiers
at
their
head
marched
men
holding
long
poles
from
which
hung
blue
placards
on
which
was
inscribed
in
huge
letters
of
the
military
on
the
curtains
of
the
litters
the
weather
was
dull
and
rainy
at
this
time
there
was
a
great
crowd
at
the
bourse
on
all
the
walls
were
posting
despatches
announcing
the
adhesion
of
the
departments
to
the
even
the
stockbrokers
while
trying
to
bull
the
market
laughed
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
at
these
placards
suddenly
a
speculator
who
had
for
two
days
been
a
great
admirer
of
the
made
his
appearance
pale
and
breathless
like
a
fugitive
and
exclaimed
are
firing
on
the
boulevards
this
is
what
had
happened
iii
a
little
after
one
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
last
order
given
by
louis
bonaparte
to
general
roguet
the
boulevards
throughout
their
whole
length
from
the
madeleine
were
suddenly
covered
with
cavalry
and
infantry
almost
the
whole
of
carrelet
division
composed
of
the
five
brigades
of
cotte
bourgon
canrobert
dulac
and
reibell
making
a
total
of
sixteen
thousand
four
hundred
and
ten
men
had
taken
up
their
position
and
extended
in
echelon
from
rue
de
la
paix
to
faubourg
poissonni√®re
each
brigade
had
its
battery
with
it
eleven
pieces
were
counted
on
boulevard
poisonni√®re
alone
two
of
the
guns
with
their
muzzles
turned
different
ways
were
levelled
at
the
entrance
to
rue
montmartre
and
faubourg
montmartre
respectively
no
one
knew
why
as
neither
the
street
nor
the
faubourg
presented
even
the
appearance
of
a
barricade
the
spectators
who
crowded
the
sidewalks
and
the
windows
gazed
in
dismay
at
all
these
guns
sabres
and
bayonets
troops
were
laughing
and
chatting
says
one
witness
another
witness
says
soldiers
acted
strangely
most
of
them
were
leaning
on
their
muskets
with
the
on
the
ground
and
seemed
nearly
falling
from
fatigue
or
something
else

of
those
old
officers

are
accustomed
to
read

there
were
now
some
indications
of
what
was
about
to
happen
at
one
moment
when
the
crowd
was
crying
to
the
troops
la
r√©publique
with
louis
bonaparte
one
of
the
officers
was
heard
to
say
in
a
low
voice
going
to
be
some
pigsticking
a
battalion
of
infantry
debouches
from
rue

before
the

it

greeted
by
a
unanimous
cry

with

the

with

being
dodged

cuts
in

one
of
the
small
trees
on
the
boulevard
as
the
regiment
of
lancers
commanded
by
colonel
rochefort
reached
a
point
abreast
of
rue

a
numerous
crowd
covered
the
pavement
of
the
boulevard
they
were
residents
of
the
quarter
tradesmen
artists
journalists
and
among
them
several
young
mothers
leading
their
children
by
the
hand
as
the
regiment
was
passing
men
and
women
every
one
cried

colonel

the

who
had
presided

on

at

by
the

of

to
the
regiment

who
at
this
banquet
had
proposed
as
a
toast
the
head
of
the
state
the
personification
of
that
order
of
which
we
are
the
defenders
this
colonel
when
the
crowd
uttered
the
above
perfectly
lawful
cry
spurred
his
horse
into
the
midst
of
them
through
the
chairs
on
the
sidewalk
while
the
lancers
precipitated
themselves
after
him
and
men
women
and
children
were
indiscriminately
cut
down
great
number
remained
dead
on
the
spot

a

about
two
two
howitzers
were
pointed
at
the
extremity
of
boulevard

a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
from
the
little
advanced
barricade
at
the
bonne
nouvelle
while
placing
the
guns
in
position
two
of
the
artillerymen
who
are
not
often
guilty
of
a
false
manoevre
broke
the
pole
of
a
caisson
you
see
they
are
drunk
exclaimed
a
man
of
the
lower
classes
at
half
past
two
for
it
is
necessary
to
follow
the
progress
of
this
hideous
drama
minute
by
minute
and
step
by
step
fire
was
opened
before
the
barricade
languidly
and
almost
as
if
done
for
amusement
the
officers
appeared
to
be
thinking
of
anything
but
a
fight
we
shall
soon
see
however
of
what
they
were
thinking
the
first
badly
aimed
passed
above
all
the
barricades
and
killed
a
little
boy
at
the
ch√¢teau
as
he
was
drawing
water
from
the
fountain
the
shops
were
shut
as
were
also
almost
all
the
windows
there
was
however
one
window
left
open
in
an
upper
story
of
the
house
at
the
corner
of
rue
du
sentier
the
curious
spectators
continued
to
assemble
mainly
on
the
southern
side
of
the
street
it
was
an
ordinary
crowd
and
nothing
more
men
women
children
and
old
people
who
looked
upon
the
languid
attack
and
defence
of
the
barricade
as
a
sort
of
sham
fight
this
barricade
served
as
a
spectacle
pending
the
moment
when
it
should
become
a
pretext
iv
the
soldiers
had
been
firing
and
the
defenders
of
the
barricade
returning
their
fire
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
any
one
being
wounded
on
either
side
when
suddenly
as
if
by
an
electric
shock
an
extraordinary
and
threatening
movement
took
place
first
in
the
infantry
then
in
the
cavalry
the
troops
suddenly
faced
about
the
historiographers
of
the
have
asserted
that
a
shot
directed
against
the
soldiers
was
fired
from
the
window
which
had
remained
open
at
the
corner
of
rue
du
sentier
others
say
that
it
was
fired
from
the
roof
of
the
house
at
the
corner
of
rue
and
rue
poissonni√®re
according
to
others
it
was
a
pistol
shot
and
was
fired
from
the
roof
of
the
tall
house
at
the
corner
of
rue
mazagran
the
shot
is
contested
but
what
can
not
be
contested
is
that
for
having
fired
this
problematical
shot
which
was
perhaps
nothing
more
than
the
slamming
of
a
door
a
dentist
who
lived
in
the
next
house
was
shot
the
question
resolves
itself
into
this
did
any
one
hear
a
pistol
or
musket
shot
fired
from
one
of
the
houses
on
the
boulevard
is
this
the
fact
or
is
it
not
a
host
of
witnesses
deny
it
if
the
shot
was
really
fired
there
still
remains
a
question
was
it
a
cause
or
was
it
a
signal
however
this
may
be
all
of
a
sudden
as
we
have
said
before
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
faced
towards
the
dense
crowd
upon
the
sidewalks
and
no
one
being
able
to
guess
why
unexpectedly
without
motive
parley
as
the
infamous
proclamations
of
the
morning
had
announced
the
butchery
began
from
the
gymnase
theatre
to
the
bains
chinois
that
is
to
say
along
the
whole
length
of
the
richest
the
most
frequented
and
the
most
joyous
boulevard
of
paris
the
army
began
shooting
down
the
people
at
close
range
it
was
a
horrible
and
indescribable
moment
the
cries
the
arms
raised
towards
heaven
the
surprise
the
terror
the
crowd
flying
in
all
directions
a
shower
of
balls
falling
on
the
pavement
and
bounding
to
the
roofs
of
the
houses
corpses
strewn
along
the
street
in
a
moment
young
men
falling
with
their
cigars
still
in
their
mouths
women
in
velvet
gowns
shot
down
by
the
long
rifles
two
booksellers
killed
on
their
own
thresholds
without
knowing
what
offence
they
had
committed
shots
fired
down
the
and
killing
any
one
no
matter

bazaar
riddled
with
shells
and
bullets

hundreds
of

upon

blood
on
rue
de
richelieu
the
narrator
must
here
again
crave
permission
to
suspend
his
narrative
in
the
presence
of
these
nameless
deeds
i
who
write
these
lines

the
names
of
the
witnesses
we
have
said
why
but
the
reader
will
easily
recognize
the
sincere
and
poignant
accent
of
reality
one
witness
says
had
not
taken
three
steps
on
the
sidewalk
when
the
troops
who
were
marching
past
suddenly
halted
faced
about
towards
the
south
levelled
their
muskets
and
by
an
instantaneous
movement
fired
upon
the
affrighted
crowd
firing
continued
uninterruptedly
for
twenty
minutes
drowned
from
time
to
time
by
a
the
first
volley
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
crept
along
on
the
pavement
like
a
snake
to
the
first
door
i
found
open
was
a
no
next
door
to
the
bazaar
de
i
was
the
last
person
who
went
in
the
firing
still
continued
this
shop
there
were
about
fifty
persons
and
among
them
five
or
six
women
and
two
or
three
children
three
poor
wretches
were
wounded
when
they
came
in
two
of
them
died
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
horrible
agony
the
third
was
still
alive
when
i
left
the
shop
at
four
however
as
i
afterwards
learned
he
did
not
survive
his
wound
order
to
give
an
idea
of
the
crowd
on
whom
the
troops
fired
i
can
not
do
better
than
mention
some
of
the
persons
assembled
in
the
shop
were
several
women
two
of
whom
had
come
into
the
quarter
to
buy
provisions
for
their
dinners
a
little
lawyer
clerk
who
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
by
his
master
two
or
three
frequenters
of
the
bourse
two
or
three
several
workmen
in
wretched
blouses
or
in
nothing
one
of
the
unhappy
beings
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
shop
produced
a
deep
impression
on
me
he
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
with
light
hair
wearing
a
gray
paletot
he
was
going
with
his
wife
to
dine
with
his
family
in
faubourg
montmartre
when
he
was
stopped
on
the
boulevard
by
the
passage
of
the
column
of
troops
at
the
very
beginning
at
the
first
discharge
both
he
and
his
wife
fell
down
he
rose
and
was
dragged
into
the
but
he
no
longer
had
his
wife
on
his
arm
and
his
despair
can
not
be
described
in
spite
of
all
we
could
say
he
insisted
that
the
door
should
be
opened
so
that
he
might
run
and
look
for
his
wife
amid
the
that
was
sweeping
the
street
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
keep
him
with
us
for
an
hour
the
next
day
i
learned
that
his
wife
had
been
killed
and
her
body
found
in
the
cit√©
berg√®re
a
fortnight
afterwards
i
was
informed
that
the
poor
wretch
having
threatened
to
apply
the
to
bonaparte
had
been
arrested
and
sent
to
brest
on
his
way
to
cayenne
almost
all
the
persons
assembled
in
the
held
monarchical
opinions
and
i
saw
only
two
a
compositor
named
meunier
who
had
formerly
worked
on
the
and
a
friend
of
his
who
declared
themselves
to
be
republicans
about
four
i
left
the
shop
another
witness
one
of
those
who
fancied
he
heard
the
on
rue
de
mazagran
adds
shot
was
a
signal
to
the
soldiers
for
a
fusillade
on
all
the
houses
and
their
windows
the
roar
of
which
lasted
at
least
thirty
minutes
the
discharge
was
simultaneous
from
porte
as
far
as
the
caf√©
du
grand
balcon
the
artillery
soon
took
part
with
the
musketry
another
witness
says
quarter
past
three
a
singular
movement
took
place
the
soldiers
who
were
facing
porte
suddenly
faced
about
resting
on
the
houses
from
the
gymnase
the
maison
du
and
the
h√¥tel
and
immediately
a
running
fire
was
directed
on
the
people
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
from
rue
to
rue
richelieu
a
few
minutes
were
sufficient
to
cover
the
pavement
with
dead
bodies
the
houses
were
riddled
with
balls
and
this
paroxysm
of
fury
on
the
part
of
the
troops
continued
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
another
witness
says
first
aimed
at
the
barricade
served
as
a
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
troops
who
fired
almost
simultaneously
at
every
one
within
range
of
their
muskets
another
witness
says
words
are
powerful
enough
to
describe
such
an
act
of
barbarity
one
must
himself
have
seen
in
order
to
be
bold
enough
to
speak
of
it
and
to
attest
the
truth
of
so
unspeakable
a
deed
soldiers
fired
thousands
and
thousands
of
shots
the
number
is
inappreciable
on
the
unoffending
crowd
and
that
without
any
sort
of
necessity
there
was
a
desire
to
produce
a
deep
impression
that
was
all
the
witness
means
but
we
have
preferred
to
change
nothing
in
the
original
depositions
another
witness
says
troops
of
the
line
followed
by
the
cavalry
and
the
artillery
arrived
on
the
boulevard
at
a
time
when
the
general
excitement
was
very
great
a
was
fired
from
the
midst
of
the
troops
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
had
been
fired
in
the
air
from
the
smoke
which
rose
perpendicularly
this
was
the
signal
for
firing
on
the
people
and
charging
them
with
the
bayonet
without
warning
this
is
a
significant
fact
and
proves
that
the
military
wanted
the
pretence
of
a
motive
for
beginning
the
massacre
which
followed
another
witness
tells
the
following
tale
cannon
loaded
with
cut
up
all
the
from
the
shop
to
rue
montmartre
from
boulevard
they
must
have
fired
also
on
the
maison
billecoq
for
it
was
struck
at
the
corner
of
the
wall
on
the
aubusson
side
and
the
ball
having
traversed
the
wall
penetrated
the
interior
of
the
house
another
witness
one
of
those
who
deny
the
shot
says
have
endeavoured
to
excuse
this
fusillade
and
these
murders
by
pretending
that
the
troops
had
been
fired
on
from
the
windows
of
some
of
the
houses
not
only
does
general
magnan
official
report
seem
to
deny
this
rumour
but
i
assert
that
the
discharge
was
instantaneous
from
porte
to
porte
montmartre
and
that
there
was
not
previously
to
the
general
discharge
a
single
shot
fired
separately
either
from
the
windows
or
by
the
soldiers
from
faubourg
to
boulevard
des
italiens
another
witness
who
is
also
one
of
those
who
did
not
hear
the
shot
says
troops
were
marching
past
the
veranda
of
the
caf√©
tortoni
where
i
had
been
about
twenty
minutes
when
before
any
report
of
had
reached
us
they
quickened
their
pace
the
cavalry
went
off
at
a
gallop
the
infantry
at
all
of
a
sudden
we
saw
coming
from
the
direction
of
boulevard
poissonni√®re
a
sheet
of
fire
which
spread
and
came
on
rapidly
i
can
vouch
for
the
fact
that
before
the
fusillade
began
there
had
been
no
report
of
and
that
not
a
single
shot
had
been
fired
from
any
of
the
houses
between
the
caf√©
frascati
and
the
spot
where
i
stood
at
last
we
saw
the
soldiers
before
us
level
their
muskets
and
threaten
us
we
took
refuge
on
rue
taitbout
under
a
at
the
same
moment
the
balls
flew
over
our
heads
and
all
around
us
a
woman
was
killed
ten
paces
from
me
just
as
i
ran
under
the
i
can
swear
that
up
to
that
time
there
was
neither
barricade
nor
insurgents
there
were
and
there
was
flying
from
them
that
is
all
this
image
and
game
is
the
one
which
immediately
suggests
itself
to
the
mind
of
all
those
who
beheld
this
horrible
proceeding
we
meet
with
the
same
simile
in
the
testimony
of
another
witness
the
end
of
my
street
and
i
know
that
the
same
thing
was
observed
in
the
neighbouring
ones
as
well
we
saw
the
gendarmes
mobiles
with
their
muskets
and
themselves
in
the
position
of
waiting
for
the
game
to
that
is
to
say
with
their
muskets
at
their
shoulders
in
order
that
they
might
take
aim
and
fire
more
quickly
order
that
those
persons
who
had
fallen
wounded
near
the
doors
on
rue
montmartre
might
receive
the
first
necessary
attentions
we
could
see
the
doors
open
from
time
to
time
and
an
arm
stretched
out
which
hastily
drew
in
the
corpse
or
dying
man
whom
the
balls
were
striving
to
claim
as
their
own
another
witness
hits
upon
the
same
image
soldiers
stationed
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
awaited
the
people
as
they
passed
hunters
lying
in
wait
for
their
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
them
in
the
street
they
fired
at
them
at
a
a
great
many
persons
were
killed
in
this
manner
on
rue
du
sentier
rue
rougemont
and
on
rue
du
go
on
said
the
officers
to
the
unoffending
citizens
who
demanded
their
protection
at
these
words
they
went
their
way
quickly
and
with
confidence
but
it
was
merely
a
watchword
which
meant
for
they
had
gone
only
a
few
steps
before
they
fell
the
moment
the
firing
began
on
the
boulevards
says
another
witness
bookseller
near
the
carpet
warehouse
was
hastily
closing
his
shop
when
a
number
of
fugitives
who
were
striving
to
obtain
admittance
were
suspected
by
the
troops
of
the
line
or
the
gendarmerie
mobile
i
do
not
know
which
of
having
fired
upon
them
the
soldiers
broke
into
the
bookseller
house
the
bookseller
endeavoured
to
explain
matters
he
was
taken
out
alone
before
his
own
door
and
his
wife
and
daughters
had
only
time
to
throw
themselves
between
him
and
the
soldiers
when
he
fell
dead
his
wife
had
her
thigh
traversed
by
a
ball
while
his
daughter
was
saved
by
the
steel
of
her
stays
i
have
been
informed
that
his
wife
has
since
gone
mad
another
witness
says
soldiers
entered
the
two
booksellers
shops
between
and
sallandrouze
the
murders
committed
there
have
been
proved
the
two
booksellers
were
massacred
on
the
pavement
the
other
prisoners
were
put
to
death
in
the
shops
let
us
conclude
with
three
extracts
which
it
is
impossible
to
transcribe
without
a
shudder
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
of
this
scene
of
horror
says
a
witness
firing
which
for
a
moment
became
less
sharp
caused
some
persons
who
were
only
wounded
to
suppose
that
they
might
get
up
of
those
who
were
lying
before
two
rose
one
of
them
fled
by
rue
du
sentier
from
which
he
was
only
a
few
yards
away
he
reached
it
amid
a
shower
of
balls
which
carried
away
his
cap
the
other
could
only
succeed
in
raising
himself
on
his
knees
in
which
position
with
his
hands
clasped
he
besought
the
soldiers
to
spare
his
life
but
he
fell
at
once
shot
dead
the
next
day
one
could
see
in
the
side
of
the
veranda
of
a
spot
only
a
few
feet
in
extent
which
more
than
a
hundred
balls
had
struck
the
end
of
rue
montmartre
as
far
as
the
fountain
a
distance
of
about
sixty
paces
there
were
sixty
bodies
of
men
and
women
mothers
children
and
young
girls
all
these
unfortunate
creatures
had
fallen
victims
of
the
first
volley
fired
by
the
troops
and
the
gendarmerie
who
were
stationed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
boulevard
they
all
fled
at
the
first
discharge
took
a
few
steps
then
fell
to
rise
no
more
one
young
man
had
taken
refuge
in
a
gateway
and
tried
to
shelter
himself
behind
the
projection
of
the
wall
towards
the
boulevards
after
ten
minutes
of
badly
aimed
shots
he
was
hit
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
render
himself
as
small
as
possible
by
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
he
too
was
seen
to
fall
to
rise
no
more
another
plate
glass
and
the
windows
in
the
maison
du
were
all
shattered
one
man
who
was
in
the
courtyard
went
mad
with
fright
the
cellars
were
filled
with
women
who
had
sought
refuge
there
but
in
vain
the
soldiers
fired
into
the
shops
and
the
cellar
windows
from
tortoni
to
the
gymnase
theatre
similar
things
took
place
this
lasted
more
than
an
hour
vi
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
these
extracts
let
us
close
this
mournful
inquest
we
have
proofs
enough
the
general
execration
of
the
deed
is
visible
a
hundred
other
depositions
which
we
have
before
us
repeat
the
same
facts
in
almost
the
same
words
it
is
at
present
certain
it
is
proved
it
is
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
it
can
not
be
denied
it
is
evident
as
the
sunlight
that
on
thursday
the
of
december
the
unoffending
citizens
of
paris
the
citizens
who
were
not
in
any
way
mixed
up
with
the
fighting
were
shot
down
without
warning
and
massacred
merely
for
the
sake
of
intimidation
and
that
it
is
not
possible
to
attach
any
other
meaning
to
monsieur
bonaparte
mysterious
command
this
execution
lasted
until
nightfall
for
more
than
an
hour
there
was
as
it
were
a
debauch
of
musketry
and
artillery
the
cannonade
and
the
crossed
each
other
indiscriminately
at
one
time
the
soldiers
were
killing
one
another
the
battery
of
the
regiment
of
artillery
which
belonged
to
canrobert
brigade
was
dismounted
the
horses
rearing
in
the
midst
of
the
balls
broke
the
axles
the
wheels
and
the
poles
and
of
the
whole
battery
in
less
than
a
minute
there
remained
only
one
gun
in
commission
a
whole
squadron
of
the
lancers
was
obliged
to
seek
refuge
in
a
shed
on
rue
seventy
were
counted
the
next
day
in
the
pennons
of
the
lances
a
sort
of
frenzy
had
seized
the
soldiers
at
the
corner
of
rue
rougemont
and
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
one
general
was
waving
his
arms
as
if
to
restrain
them
a
medical
officer
of
the
was
nearly
killed
by
the
soldiers
whom
he
endeavoured
to
check
a
sergeant
said
to
an
officer
who
took
hold
of
his
arm
you
are
betraying
us
the
soldiers
had
no
consciousness
of
themselves
they
had
gone
mad
with
the
crime
they
were
ordered
to
commit
there
comes
a
moment
when
the
very
outrageousness
of
what
you
are
doing
makes
you
redouble
your
blows
blood
is
a
kind
of
horrible
wine
men
get
drunk
with
carnage
it
seemed
as
if
some
invisible
hand
were
launching
death
from
the
midst
of
a
cloud
the
soldiers
were
no
longer
aught
but
projectiles
two
guns
in
the
roadway
of
the
boulevard
were
pointed
at
the
front
of
a
single
house
that
of
sallandrouze
and
fired
volley
after
volley
at
it
at
close
range
this
house
which
is
an
old
mansion
of
hewn
stone
remarkable
for
its
almost
monumental
flight
of
steps
being
split
by
bullets
as
if
by
iron
wedges
opened
gaped
and
cracked
from
top
to
bottom
the
soldiers
fired
faster
and
faster
at
every
discharge
the
walls
cracked
again
suddenly
an
officer
of
artillery
galloped
up
and
cried
hold
the
house
was
leaning
forward
another
ball
and
it
would
have
fallen
on
the
guns
and
the
gunners
the
artillerymen
were
so
drunk
that
many
of
them
not
knowing
what
they
were
doing
allowed
themselves
to
be
killed
by
the
rebound
of
their
guns
the
balls
came
simultaneously
from
porte
boulevard
poissonni√®re
and
boulevard
montmartre
the
drivers
hearing
them
whizzing
past
their
ears
in
every
direction
lay
down
upon
their
horses
while
the
gunners
hid
underneath
the
caissons
and
behind
the
wagons
soldiers
were
seen
to
drop
their
caps
and
fly
in
dismay
into
rue
troopers
losing
their
heads
fired
their
carbines
in
the
air
while
others
dismounted
and
made
a
breastwork
of
their
horses
two
or
three
of
the
latter
without
riders
ran
here
and
there
mad
with
terror
the
most
horrible
amusements
were
blended
with
the
massacre
the
tirailleurs
from
vincennes
had
established
themselves
at
one
of
the
barricades
on
the
boulevard
which
they
had
carried
by
assault
and
from
thence
they
practised
shooting
at
persons
passing
at
a
distance
from
the
neighbouring
houses
such
shocking
dialogues
as
this
were
heard
bet
i
bring
that
fellow
down
bet
you
do
bet
i
do
and
the
shot
followed
when
the
man
fell
one
could
guess
by
the
roar
of
laughter
whenever
a
woman
passed
the
officers
cried
at
that
woman
fire
at
the
women
this
was
one
of
the
watchwords
on
boulevard
montmartre
where
the
bayonet
was
greatly
in
requisition
a
young
cried
the
women
one
woman
with
a
loaf
under
her
arm
thought
she
might
cross
rue
a
tirailleur
shot
her
down
on
rue
they
did
not
go
so
far
a
woman
cried
la
r√©publique
she
was
merely
whipped
by
the
soldiers
but
let
us
return
to
the
boulevard
one
of
the
a
bailiff
was
struck
by
a
ball
aimed
at
his
head
he
fell
on
his
hands
and
knees
imploring
mercy
he
received
thirteen
more
balls
in
his
body
he
survived
by
a
miraculous
chance
not
one
of
his
wounds
was
mortal
the
ball
which
struck
his
head
tore
the
skin
and
made
the
circuit
of
his
skull
without
fracturing
it
an
old
man
of
eighty
being
found
concealed
somewhere
or
other
was
brought
before
the
steps
of
and
shot
he
fell
will
have
no
bump
on
his
head
said
a
soldier
the
old
man
had
fallen
upon
a
heap
of
dead
bodies
two
young
men
from
issy
who
had
been
married
only
a
month
to
two
sisters
were
crossing
the
boulevard
on
their
way
from
business
they
saw
the
muskets
levelled
at
them
and
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
crying
married
the
two
sisters
they
were
killed
a
dealer
in
cocoa
named
robert
living
on
faubourg
poissonni√®re
no
fled
with
his
can
on
his
back
down
rue
montmartre
he
was
killed
a
boy
of
thirteen
a
saddler
apprentice
was
passing
along
the
boulevard
opposite
the
caf√©
vachette
the
soldiers
took
aim
at
him
he
uttered
the
most
cries
and
holding
up
a
bridle
that
he
had
in
his
hand
waved
it
in
the
air
exclaiming
am
sent
on
an
errand
he
was
killed
three
balls
perforated
his
breast
all
along
the
boulevards
were
heard
the
shrieks
and
heavy
falls
of
the
wounded
whom
the
soldiers
pierced
with
their
bayonets
and
then
left
without
taking
the
trouble
to
despatch
them
we
may
name
the
witness
who
saw
this
he
is
one
of
the
proscribed
it
is
versigny
a
representative
of
the
people
he
says
can
still
see
opposite
rue
du
croissant
an
unfortunate
itinerant
vender
of
cocoa
with
his
tin
can
on
his
back
stagger
then
gradually
sink
in
a
heap
and
fall
dead
before
a
shop
armed
only
with
his
bell
he
had
received
all
by
himself
the
honour
of
being
fired
at
by
a
whole
platoon
the
same
witness
adds
soldiers
swept
the
streets
with
their
guns
even
where
there
was
not
a
moved
from
its
place
not
a
single
combatant
some
villains
seized
the
opportunity
to
steal
the
treasurer
of
a
company
whose
offices
are
on
rue
de
la
banque
left
at
two
to
collect
a
note
on
rue
berg√®re
returned
with
the
money
and
was
killed
on
the
boulevard
when
his
body
was
removed
he
had
neither
ring
nor
watch
nor
the
money
he
was
taking
to
his
office
on
the
pretence
that
shots
had
been
fired
at
the
troops
the
latter
entered
ten
or
twelve
houses
at
random
and
despatched
with
their
bayonets
every
one
they
found
in
all
the
houses
on
the
boulevard
there
are
metal
pipes
by
which
the
dirty
water
runs
out
into
the
gutter
the
soldiers
with
no
idea
why
it
was
so
conceived
a
feeling
of

the
cry
of
it
to
the
at
the

where
many
of
the
regular
frequenters
of
the
place
were
assembled
among
them
an
old
general
they
heard
the
thunder
of
musketry
and
artillery
and
could
not
believe
that
the
troops
were
firing
ball
they
laughed
and
said
to
one
another
blank
cartridges
what
a
what
an
actor
this
bonaparte
is
they
thought
they
were
at
the
circus
suddenly
the

entered
mad
with
rage
and
were
about
to
shoot
every
one
they
had
no
idea
of
the
danger
they
were
running
they
continued
to
laugh
one
of
the
said

that
this
was

of

seeing
that
the
soldiers
continued
to
threaten
them
they
at
last
them
all
cried
the
soldiers
a
lieutenant
who
recognized
the
old
general
prevented
them
from
carrying
out
their
threat
in
spite
of
this
a
sergeant
said

is
your
affair

ours

the
soldiers
were
coolly
going
to
shoot
even
the
women
and
children
who
were
already
drawn
up
in
a
mass
before
a
platoon
for
that
purpose
when
a
colonel
arrived
he
stopped
the
massacre
boxed
up
these
poor
trembling
creatures
in
the
passages

where
he
locked
them
in
and
saved
them
a
celebrated

after
having
escaped
the
first
balls
was
led
about
during
an
hour
from

him
the

indiscriminately
the

person
killed
in
this
butchery
history
has
in
like
manner
preserved
the
name
of
the
first
person
killed
at
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
was
one
th√©odore
debaecque
who
lived
in
the
house
at
the
corner
of
rue
du
sentier
where
the
carnage
began
vii
when
the
slaughter
came
to
an
end
that
is
to
say
when
it
was
black
night
and
it
had
begun
in
broad
day
the
dead
bodies
were
not
removed
they
were
so
numerous
that
of
them
were
counted
before
a
single
shop
that
of
barbedienne
every
square
of
ground
left
open
in
the
asphalt
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
on
the
boulevards
was
a
reservoir
of
blood
dead
bodies
says
a
witness
piled
up
in
heaps
one
upon
another
old
men
children
blouses
and
paletots
assembled
in
an
indescribable
mass
of
heads
arms
and
legs
another
witness
describes
thus
a
group
of
three
individuals
had
fallen
on
their
backs
and
the
third
having
tripped
over
their
legs
had
fallen
upon
them
the
single
corpses
were
rare
and
attracted
more
notice
than
the
others
one
young
man
well
dressed
was
seated
against
a
wall
with
his
legs
apart
his
arms
half
folded
one
of
canes
in
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
looking
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
he
was
dead
a
little
farther
on
the
bullets
had
nailed
against
a
shop
a
youth
in
velveteen
trousers
who
had
some
in
his
hand
the
wind
fluttered
these
bloody
proofs
on
which
the
fingers
of
the
corpse
were
still
closed
a
poor
old
man
with
white
hair
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
his
umbrella
at
his
side
his
elbow
almost
touched
a
young
man
in
patent
leather
boots
and
yellow
gloves
who
had
his
still
in
his
eye
a
few
steps
away
with
her
head
on
the
sidewalk
and
her
feet
in
the
road
lay
a
woman
of
the
people
who
had
attempted
to
escape
with
her
child
in
her
arms
both
were
dead
but
the
mother
still
tightly
grasped
her
child
ah
you
will
tell
me
bonaparte
that
you
are
very
sorry
but
that
it
was
an
unfortunate
affair
that
in
presence
of
paris
ready
to
rise
it
was
necessary
to
adopt
a
decided
course
and
that
you
were
forced
to
this
extremity
that
as
regards
the
you
were
in
debt
that
your
ministers
were
in
debt
that
your
were
in
debt
that
your
footmen
were
in
debt
that
you
were
answerable
for
them
all
and
that
deuce
take
it
a
man
can
not
be
a
prince
without
spending
from
time
to
time
a
few
millions
too
much
that
one
must
amuse
self
and
enjoy
life
a
bit
that
the
assembly
was
to
blame
for
not
having
understood
this
and
for
seeking
to
restrict
you
to
two
paltry
millions
a
year
and
what
is
more
to
force
you
to
resign
your
authority
at
the
expiration
of
your
four
years
and
to
execute
the
constitution
that
after
all
you
could
not
leave
the
√©lys√©e
to
enter
the
debtors
prison
at
clichy
that
you
had
in
vain
had
recourse
to
those
little
expedients
which
are
provided
for
by
article
that
exposure
was
at
hand
that
the
demagogical
press
was
chattering
that
the
matter
of
the
gold
ingots
threatened
to
become
known
that
you
were
bound
to
respect
the
name
of
napoleon
and
that
on
my
word
having
no
other
alternative
rather
than
become
one
of
the
vulgar
swindlers
named
in
the
code
you
preferred
to
be
one
of
the
great
assassins
of
history
so
then
instead
of
polluting
this
blood
has
purified
you
very
good
i
resume
viii
when
all
was
finished
paris
came
to
see
the
sight
the
people
flocked
in
crowds
to
those
terrible
places
no
one
interfered
with
them
this
was
what
the
butcher
wanted
louis
bonaparte
had
not
done
all
this
to
hide
it
afterwards
the
southern
side
of
the
boulevard
was
covered
with
torn
cartridge
wads
the
sidewalk
on
the
northern
side
disappeared
beneath
the
mortar
torn
from
the
fronts
of
the
houses
by
the
bullets
and
was
as
white
as
if
snow
had
fallen
on
it
while
pools
of
blood
left
large
dark
patches
on
that
snow
of
ruins
the
foot
of
the
avoided
a
corpse
only
to
tread
upon
fragments
of
broken
glass
plaster
or
stone
some
houses
were
so
riddled
by
the
grape
and
that
they
seemed
on
the
point
of
tumbling
down
this
was
the
case
with
sallandrouze
which
we
have
already
mentioned
and
the
mourning
warehouse
at
the
corner
of
faubourg
montmartre
billecoq
house
says
a
witness
at
the
present
moment
still
propped
up
by
wooden
beams
and
the
front
will
have
to
be
partly
rebuilt
the
balls
have
made
holes
in
the
carpet
warehouse
in
several
places
another
witness
says
the
houses
from
the
cercle
des
√©trangers
to
rue
poissonni√®re
were
literally
riddled
with
balls
especially
on
the
side
of
the
boulevard
one
of
the
large
panes
of
plate
glass
in
the
warehouses
of
petite
received
certainly
more
than
two
hundred
for
its
share
there
was
not
a
window
that
had
not
its
ball
one
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
saltpetre
corpses
were
heaped
up
in
the
cit√©
berg√®re
the
could
count
them
through
the
iron
railings
a
woman
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
rue
richelieu
she
was
looking
on
suddenly
she
felt
that
her
feet
were
wet
has
it
been
raining
she
said
feet
are
in
the
water
madame
replied
a
person
who
was
passing
is
not
water
her
feet
were
in
a
pool
of
blood
on
rue
three
corpses
were
seen
in
a
corner
quite
naked
during
the
butchery
the
barricades
on
the
boulevards
had
been
carried
by
bourgon
brigade
the
corpses
of
those
who
had
defended
the
barricade
at
porte
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
at
the
beginning
of
our
narrative
were
piled
up
before
the
door
of
the
maison
jouvin
says
a
witness
were
nothing
compared
to
the
heaps
which
covered
the
boulevard
about
two
paces
from
the
th√©√¢tre
des
vari√©t√©s
the
crowd
stopped
to
look
at
a
cap
full
of
brains
and
blood
hung
upon
a
tree
a
witness
says
little
beyond
the
vari√©t√©s
i
came
to
a
corpse
lying
on
the
ground
with
its
face
downwards
i
tried
to
raise
it
aided
by
others
but
we
were
repelled
by
the
soldiers
a
little
farther
on
there
were
two
bodies
a
man
and
a
woman
then
one
alone
a
we
abridge
the
account
rue
montmartre
to
rue
du
sentier
literally
walked
in
at
certain
spots
it
covered
the
sidewalk
some
inches
deep
and
without
exaggeration
one
was
obliged
to
use
the
greatest
caution
not
to
step
into
it
i
counted
there
corpses
the
sight
was
too
much
for
me
i
felt
great
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
i
asked
leave
to
cross
the
road
in
order
to
enter
my
own
house
and
my
request
was
as
a
another
witness
says
boulevard
presented
a
horrible
sight
literally
walked
in
we
counted
eighteen
corpses
in
about
five
and
twenty
paces
another
witness
the
keeper
of
a
on
rue
du
sentier
says
went
along
boulevard
du
temple
to
my
house
when
i
got
home
i
had
an
inch
of
blood
around
the
bottom
of
my
trousers
representative
versigny
has
this
to
say
could
see
in
the
distance
almost
as
far
as
porte
the
immense
of
the
infantry
the
light
from
them
with
the
exception
of
that
from
a
few
rare
lamps
was
all
we
had
to
guide
us
amid
that
horrible
carnage
the
fighting
in
the
daytime
was
nothing
compared
to
those
corpses
and
that
silence
and
i
were
with
horror
a
man
was
passing
us
hearing
one
of
my
exclamations
he
came
up
to
me
took
my
hand
and
said
you
are
a
republican
and
i
was
what
is
called
a
friend
of
order
a
reactionary
but
one
must
be
forsaken
of
god
not
to
execrate
this
horrible
orgy
france
is
dishonoured
and
he
left
us
sobbing
another

who
allows
us
to
give
his
name
a
legitimist
the
honourable
monsieur
de
cherville
deposes
as
follows
the
evening
i
determined
on
continuing
my
sad
inspection
on
rue
le
peletier
i
met
messieurs
bouillon
and
gervais
of
caen
we
walked
a
few
steps
together
when
my
foot
slipped
i
clung
to
bouillon
i
looked
at
my
feet
i
had
walked
into
a
large
pool
of
blood
bouillon
then
informed
me
that
being
at
his
window
in
the
morning
he
saw
a
druggist
whose
shop
he
pointed
out
to
me
shutting
his
door
a
woman
fell
the
druggist
rushed
forward
to
raise
her
at
the
same
moment
a
soldier
ten
paces
off
aimed
at
him
and
lodged
a
bullet
in
his
head
overcome
with
wrath
and
forgetting
his
own
danger
bouillon
exclaimed
to
the
you
will
all
bear
witness
to
what
has
taken
place
about
eleven
at
night
when
the
fires
of
the
bivouacs
were
everywhere
lighted
bonaparte
allowed
the
troops
to
amuse
themselves
it
was
like
a
on
the
boulevards
the
soldiers
laughed
and
sang
as
they
threw
into
the
fire
the
d√©bris
of
the
barricades
after
this
as
at
strasbourg
and
boulogne
money
was
distributed
among
them
let
us
hear
what
a
witness
says
saw
at
porte
a
give
two
hundred
francs
to
the
chief
of
a
detachment
of
twenty
men
with
these
words
the
prince
ordered
me
to
give
you
this
money
to
be
distributed
among
your
brave
soldiers
the
marks
of
his
satisfaction
will
not
be
confined
to
this
each
soldier
received
ten
francs
on
the
evening
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
emperor
said
i
am
content
with
you
another
person
adds
soldiers
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
twitted
the
and
jingled
the
money
in
their
pockets
another
says
officers
broke
the
rolls
of
louis
sticks
of
the
sentinels
allowed
only
women
to
pass
whenever
a
man
made
his
appearance
they
cried
off
tables
were
spread
in
the
bivouacs
and
officers
and
soldiers
drank
around
them
the
flame
of
the
braziers
was
reflected
on
all
those
merry
faces
the
corks
and
capsules
of
the
champagne
bottles
floated
on
the
red
torrents
of
blood
from
bivouac
to
bivouac
the
soldiers
exchanged
loud
cries
and
obscene
jokes
they
saluted
one
another
with
live
the
grenadiers
live
the
lancers
and
all
joined
in
live
one
heard
the
clinking
of
glasses
and
the
crash
of
broken
bottles
here
and
there
in
the
shadow
women
with
a
taper
of
yellow
wax
or
a
lantern
in
their
hands
prowled
among
the
dead
bodies
gazing
at
those
pale
faces
one
after
another
and
seeking
a
son
a
father
or
a
husband
ix
let
us
hasten
to
have
done
with
these
ghastly
details
the
next
day
the
fifth
something
terrible
was
seen
in
the
cemetery
of
montmartre
an
immense
space
the
exact
location
of
which
is
unknown
to
this
day
was
for
the
temporary
interment
of
some
of
those
who
had
been
massacred
they
were
buried
with
their
heads
above
ground
in
order
that
their
relations
might
recognize
them
most
of
them
had
also
their
feet
above
ground
with
a
little
earth
upon
their
breasts
the
crowd
flocked
to
the
spot
the
sightseers
pushed
one
here
and
there
they
wandered
about
among
the
graves
and
at
times
one
felt
the
earth
giving
way
beneath
one
feet
one
was
walking
on
the
stomach
of
a
corpse
one
turned
and
beheld
a
pair
of
boots
of
sabots
or
of
shoes
while
on
the
other
side
was
the
head
which
the
pressure
on
the
body
caused
to
move
an
illustrious
witness
the
great
sculptor
david
who
is
now
proscribed
and
wandering
far
from
france
says
the
cemetery
of
montmartre
i
saw
about
forty
bodies
with
their
clothes
still
on
them
they
had
been
placed
side
by
side
and
a
few
shovelfuls
of
earth
hid
all
except
their
heads
which
had
been
left
uncovered
in
order
that
they
might
be
recognized
by
their
relations
there
was
so
little
earth
that
their
feet
were
still
visible
the
crowd
horrible
to
say
was
walking
on
their
bodies
among
them
were
young
men
with
noble
features
bearing
the
stamp
of
courage
in
the
midst
was
a
poor
woman
a
baker
servant
who
had
been
killed
while
she
was
carrying
bread
to
her
master
customers
and
near
her
a
young
girl
who
sold
flowers
on
the
boulevards
those
persons
who
were
looking
for
friends
who
had
disappeared
were
obliged
to
trample
the
bodies
under
foot
in
order
to
obtain
a
near
view
of
their
faces
i
heard
a
man
of
the
lower
classes
say
with
an
expression
of
horror
it
is
like
walking
upon
a
the
crowd
continued
to
flock
to
the
various
spots
where
the
victims
had
been
carried
especially
to
the
cit√©
berg√®re
so
that
on
this
day
the
fifth
as
the
numbers
increased
to
such
an
extent
as
to
become
troublesome
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
get
rid
of
them
these
words
written
in
capital
letters
on
a
large
placard
were
to
be
seen
at
the
entrance
of
the
cit√©
berg√®re
are
no
more
dead
bodies
here
the
three
naked
corpses
on
rue
were
not
removed
until
the
evening
of
the
fifth
it
is
evident
and
we
insist
upon
it
that
at
first
and
for
the
advantage
which
it
wished
to
derive
from
it
the
did
not
make
the
least
endeavour
to
conceal
its
crime
shame
did
not
come
until
later
the
first
day
on
the
contrary

flaunted
it
it
was
not
content
with
atrocity
it
must
needs
add
cynicism
massacre
was
but
a
means
the
end
was
intimidation
x
was
this
end
attained
yes
immediately
afterwards
as
early
as
the
evening
of
december
the
public
excitement
subsided
paris
was
frozen
with
stupor
the
indignation
that
raised
its
voice
before
the
held
its
peace
before
the
carnage
the
affair
had
ceased
to
resemble
anything
in
history
one
felt
that
one
had
to
deal
with
a
man
of
a
hitherto
unknown
type
crassus
crushed
the
gladiators
herod
slaughtered
the
infants
charles
ix
exterminated
the
huguenots
peter
of
russia
the
strelitz
mehemet
ali
the
mamelukes
mahmoud
the
janissaries
while
danton
massacred
the
prisoners
louis
bonaparte
had
just
discovered
a
new
sort
of
massacre
the
massacre
of
the
this
massacre
ended
the
struggle
there
are
times
when
what
should
exasperate
a
people
strikes
them
with
terror
the
population
of
paris
felt
that
a
ruffian
had
his
foot
upon
his
throat
it
no
longer
offered
any
resistance
that
same
evening
mathieu
of
the
dr√¥me
entered
the
place
where
the
committee
of
resistance
was
sitting
and
said
to
us
are
no
longer
in
paris
we
are
no
longer
under
the
republic
we
are
at
naples
under
the
sway
of
king
bomba
from
that
moment
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
committee
of
the
representatives
and
of
their
courageous
allies
there
was
save
at
certain
points
only
such
as
the
barricade
of
the
for
instance
where
denis
dussoubs
the
brother
of
the
representative
fell
so
heroically
naught
but
a
resistance
which
resembled
the
last
convulsions
of
despair
rather
than
a
combat
all
was
finished
the
next
day
the
the
victorious
troops
paraded
on
the
boulevards
a
general
was
seen
to
show
his
naked
sword
to
the
people
and
to
exclaim
republic
here
it
is
thus
an
infamous
butchery
the
massacre
of
the
was
included
as
a
supreme
necessity
in
the
of
the
of
december
to
undertake
it
a
man
must
be
a
traitor
to
make
it
successful
he
must
be
an
assassin
it
was
by
this
proceeding
that
the
conquered
france
and
overcame
paris
yes
paris
it
is
necessary
for
one
to
repeat
it
again
and
again
to
himself
it
was
at
paris
that
all
this
happened
great
god
the
russians
entered
paris
brandishing
their
lances
and
singing
their
wild
songs
but
moscow
had
been
burnt
the
prussians
entered
paris
but
berlin
had
been
taken
the
austrians
entered
paris
but
vienna
had
been
bombarded
the
english
entered
paris
but
the
camp
at
boulogne
had
menaced
london
they
came
to
our
barriers
these
men
of
all
nations
with
drums
beating
trumpets
resounding
colours
flying
swords
drawn
cannon
rumbling
matches
lighted
drunk
with
excitement
enemies
conquerors
instruments
of
vengeance
shrieking
with
rage
before
the
domes
of
paris
the
names
of
their
capitals
london
berlin
vienna
moscow
the
moment
however
that
they
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
city
the
moment
that
the
hoofs
of
their
horses
rang
upon
the
pavement
of
our
streets
englishmen
austrians
prussians
russians
on
entering
paris
beheld
in
its
walls
its
buildings
its
people
something
predestined
something
venerable
and
august
they
all
felt
a
holy
sentiment
of
respect
for
the
sacred
city
they
all
felt
that
they
had
before
them
not
the
city
of
one
people
but
the
city
of
the
whole
human
race
they
all
lowered
the
swords
they
had
raised
yes
to
massacre
the
parisians
to
treat
paris
like
a
place
taken
by
assault
to
deliver
up
to
pillage
one
quarter
of
the
town
to
outrage
the
second
eternal
city
to
assassinate
civilization
in
her
very
sanctuary
to
shoot
down
old
men
children
and
women
in
this
illustrious
spot
this
home
of
the
world
that
which
wellington
forbade
his
highlanders
and
schwartzenberg

croats
to
do
that
which
blucher

not

the
functionary
who
drew
up
this
list
is
we
know
a
learned
and
accurate
statistician
he
prepared
this
statement
honestly
we
have
no
doubt
he
has
stated
what
was
shown
to
him
and
what
he
was
permitted
to
see
but
what
was
concealed
from
him
was
beyond
his
reach
the
field
for
conjecture
is
left
open
to
abridge
louis
bonaparte
confesses
in
this
state
paper
hundred
and
murders
this
document
being
cited
for
what
it
is
worth
the
question
is
what
is
the
true
total
what
is
the
exact
figure
of
his
victims
how
many
corpses
bestrew
the
of
december
who
can
tell
who
knows
who
will
ever
know
as
we
have
already
seen
one
witness
deposed
i
counted
in
that
place
bodies
another
at
a
different
part
of
the
boulevard
said
we
counted
eighteen
bodies
within
a
space
of
twenty
or
yards
a
third
person
speaking
of
another
spot
said
there
were
upwards
of
sixty
bodies
within
a
distance
of
sixty
yards
the
writer
so
long
threatened
with
death
told
ourselves
i
saw
with
my
eyes
upwards
of
eight
hundred
dead
bodies
lying
along
the
boulevard
now
think
compute
how
many
it
requires
of
battered
brains
of
breasts
shattered
by
to
cover
with
blood
literally
half
a
mile
of
boulevards
go
you
as
did
the
wives
the
sisters
the
daughters
the
wailing
mothers
take
a
torch
plunge
into
the
dark
night
feel
on
the
ground
feel
along
the
pavement
and
the
walls
pick
up
the
corpses
interrogate
the
phantoms
and
reckon
if
you
can
the
number
of
his
victims
one
is
reduced
to
conjecture
this
question
must
be
solved
by
history
as
for
us
it
is
a
question
which
we
pledge
ourselves
to
examine
and
explore
hereafter
on
the
first
day
louis
bonaparte
made
a
display
of
his
slaughter
we
have
told
the
reason
why
it
suited
his
purpose
after
that
having
derived
from
the
deed
all
the
required
advantage
he
concealed
it
orders
were
given
to
the
√©lys√©an
journals
to
be
silent
to
magnan
to
omit
to
the
historiographers
to
know
nothing
they
buried
the
slain
after
midnight
without
lights
without
processions
without
prayers
without
priests
by
stealth
families
were
enjoined
not
to
weep
too
loud
the
massacre
along
the
boulevards
was
only
a
part
it
was
followed
by
the
summary
fusillades
the
secret
executions
one
of
the
witnesses
whom
we
have
questioned
asked
a
major
in
the
gendarmerie
mobile
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
these
butcheries
come
tell
us
the
figure
was
it
four
hundred
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
was
it
six
hundred
the
man
shook
his
head
eight
hundred
say
twelve
hundred
said
the
officer
and
you
will
fall
short
at
this
present
hour
nobody
knows
exactly
what
the
of
december
was
what
it
did
what
it
dared
whom
it
killed
whom
it
buried
the
very
morning
of
the
crime
the
newspaper
offices
were
placed
under
seal
free
speech
was
suppressed
by
louis
bonaparte
that
man
of
silence
and
darkness
on
the
the
the
the
and
ever
since
truth
has
been
taken
by
the
throat
and
strangled
just
as
she
was
about
to
speak
she
could
not
even
utter
a
cry
he
has
deepened
the
gloom
about
his
ambuscade
and
he
has
succeeded
in
part
let
history
strive
as
she
may
the
of
december
will
perhaps
continue
involved
for
a
long
time
to
come
in
a
sort
of
ghastly
twilight
it
is
a
crime
made
up
of
audacity
and
darkness
here
it
shows
itself
impudently
in
broad
daylight
there
it
skulks
away
into
the
mist
hideous
and
effrontery
which
conceals
no
one
knows
what
monstrosities
beneath
its
cloak
but
these
glimpses
are
sufficient
there
is
a
certain
side
of
the
of
december
where
all
is
dark
but
within
that
darkness
graves
are
visible
beneath
this
great
enormity
a
host
of
crimes
may
be
vaguely
distinguished
such
is
the
behest
of
providence
there
are
compulsions
linked
to
treason
you
are
a
perjurer
you
violate
your
oaths
you
trample
upon
law
and
justice
well
take
a
rope
for
you
will
be
compelled
to
strangle
take
a
dagger
for
you
will
be
compelled
to
stab
take
a
club
for
you
will
be
compelled
to
strike
take
shadow
and
darkness
for
you
will
be
compelled
to
hide
yourself
one
crime
brings
on
another
there
is
a
logical
consistency
in
horror
there
is
no
halting
no
middle
course
go
on
do
this
first
good
now
do
that
then
this
again
and
so
for
ever
the
law
is
like
the
veil
of
the
temple
once
rent
it
is
rent
from
top
to
bottom
yes
we
say
it
again
in
what
has
been
called
the
act
of
the
of
december
one
meets
with
crime
at
every
depth
perjury
floats
on
the
surface
murder
lies
at
the
bottom
partial
homicides
wholesale
butcheries
shooting
in
open
day
fusillades
by
night
a
steam
of
blood
rises
from
every
part
of
the
search
in
the
common
grave
of
the
churchyards
search
beneath
the
street
pavement
beneath
the
sloping
banks
of
the
beneath
the
trees
of
the
public
gardens
in
the
bed
of
the
seine
but
few
revelations
that
is
easily
understood
bonaparte
has
the
satanic
art
of
binding
to
himself
a
crowd
of
miserable
officials
by
i
know
not
what
terrible
universal
complicity
the
stamped
papers
of
the
magistrates
the
desks
of
the
registrars
the
of
the
soldiers
the
prayers
of
the
priests
are
his
accomplices
he
has
cast
his
crime
about
him
like
a
network
and
prefects
mayors
judges
officers
and
soldiers
are
caught
therein
complicity
descends
from
the
general
to
the
corporal
and
ascends
from
the
corporal
to
the
president
the
and
the
minister
feel
that
they
are
equally
implicated
the
gendarme
whose
pistol
has
pressed
against
the
ear
of
some
unfortunate
and
whose
uniform
has
been
splashed
with
human
brains
feels
as
guilty
as
his
colonel
above
cruel
men
gave
orders
which
savage
men
executed
below
savagery
keeps
the
secret
of
cruelty
hence
this
hideous
silence
there
is
even
emulation
and
rivalry
between
this
savagery
and
this
atrocity
what
escaped
the
one
was
seized
upon
by
the
other
the
future
will
refuse
to
credit
these
prodigious
excesses
a
workman
was
crossing
the
pont
au
change
some
gendarmes
mobiles
stopped
him
they
smelt
his
hands
he
smells
of
powder
said
a
gendarme
they
shot
the
workman
his
body
was
pierced
by
four
balls
throw
him
into
the
stream
cries
the
sergeant
the
gendarmes
take
him
by
the
neck
and
heels
and
hurl
him
over
the
bridge
shot
and
then
drowned
the
man
floats
down
the
river
however
he
was
not
dead
the
icy
river
revived
him
but
he
was
unable
to
move
his
blood
flowed
into
the
water
from
four
holes
but
being
held
up
by
his
blouse
he
struck
against
an
arch
of
one
of
the
bridges
there
some
lightermen
discovered
him
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
to
the
hospital
he
recovered
he
left
the
place
the
next
day
he
was
arrested
and
brought
before
a
rejected
by
death
he
was
reclaimed
by
louis
bonaparte
this
man
is
now
at
lambessa
what
the
secretly
witnessed
the
terrible
night
tragedies
which
dismayed
and
dishonoured
it
history
can
not
yet
reveal
thanks
to
louis
bonaparte
this
revered
field
of
the
federation
may
in
future
be
called
aceldama
one
of
the
unhappy
soldiers
whom
the
man
of
the
of
december
transformed
into
executioners
relates
with
horror
and
beneath
his
breath
that
in
a
single
night
the
number
of
people
shot
was
not
less
than
eight
hundred
louis
bonaparte
hastened
to
dig
a
grave
and
threw
in
his
crime
a
few
shovelfuls
of
earth
a
sprinkling
of
holy
water
by
a
priest
and
all
was
said
and
now
the
imperial
carnival
dances
above
that
grave
is
this
all
can
it
be
that
this
is
the
end
does
god
allow
and
acquiesce
in
such
burials
believe
it
not
some
day
beneath
the
feet
of
bonaparte
between
the
marble
pavements
of
the
√©lys√©e
or
the
tuileries
this
grave
will
suddenly
and
those
bodies
will
come
forth
one
after
another
each
with
its
wound
the
young
man
stricken
to
the
heart
the
old
man
shaking
his
aged
head
pierced
by
a
ball
the
mother
put
to
the
sword
with
her
infant
killed
in
her
arms
all
of
them
upstanding
pallid
terrible
to
see
and
with
bleeding
eyes
fixed
on
their
assassin
awaiting
that
day
and
even
now
history
has
begun
to
try
you
louis
bonaparte
history
rejects
your
official
list
of
the
dead
and
your
history
asserts
that
they
lie
and
that
you
lie
you
have
tied
a
bandage
over
the
eyes
of
france
and
put
a
gag
in
her
mouth
wherefore
was
it
to
do
righteous
deeds
no
but
crimes
the
is
afraid
of
the
light
you
shot
people
by
night
on
the
at
the
prefecture
at
the
palais
de
justice
on
the
squares
on
the
quays
everywhere
you
say
you
did
not
i
say
you
did
in
dealing
with
you
we
have
a
right
to
surmise
to
suspect
and
to
accuse
what
you
deny
we
have
a
right
to
believe
your
denial
is
equivalent
to
affirmation
your
of
december
is
pointed
at
by
the
public
conscience
nobody
thinks
of
it
without
inwardly
shuddering
what
did
you
do
in
those
dark
hours
your
days
are
ghastly
your
nights
are
suspicious
ah
man
of
darkness
that
you
are
let
us
return
to
the
butchery
on
the
boulevard
to
the
words
let
my
orders
be
executed
and
to
the
day
of
the
louis
bonaparte
during
the
evening
of
that
day
must
have
compared
himself
to
charles
x
who
refused
to
burn
paris
and
to
louis
philippe
who
would
not
shed
the
people
blood
and
he
must
have
done
himself
the
justice
to
admit
that
he
is
a
great
politician
a
few
days
later
general
t
formerly
in
the
service
of
one
of
the
sons
of
king
louis
philippe
came
to
the
√©lys√©e
as
soon
as
louis
bonaparte
caught
sight
of
him
the
comparison
we
have
just
pointed
out
suggesting
itself
to
him
he
cried
out
to
the
general
exultingly
well
louis
bonaparte
is
in
very
truth
the
man
who
said
to
one
of
his
former
ministers
who
was
our
own
informant
i
been
charles
x
and
had
i
during
the
days
of
july
caught
laffitte
benjamin
constant
and
lafayette
i
would
have
had
them
shot
like
on
the
of
december
louis
bonaparte
would
have
been
dragged
that
very
night
from
the
√©lys√©e
and
the
law
would
have
prevailed
had
he
been
one
of
those
men
who
recoil

this
man
in

all
these
heads
will
fall
whilst
we
are
writing
this
is
what
has
just
occurred
at
belley
a
native
of
bugez
near
belley
a
named
charlet
had
warmly
advocated
on
the
of
december
the
election
of
louis
bonaparte
he
had
distributed
circulars
supported
propagated
and
hawked
them
the
election
was
in
his
eyes
a
triumph
he
hoped
in
he
took
seriously
the
socialist
writings
of
the
prisoner
of
ham
and
his
philanthropical
and
republican
programmes
on
the
of
december
there
were
many
such
honest
dupes
they
are
now
the
most
indignant
when
louis
bonaparte
was
in
power
when
they
saw
the
man
at
work
these
illusions
vanished
charlet
a
man
of
intelligence
was
one
of
those
whose
republican
probity
was
outraged
and
gradually
as
louis
bonaparte
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
into
reactionary
measures
charlet
shook
himself
free
thus
did
he
pass
from
the
most
confiding
partisanship
to
the
most
open
and
zealous
opposition
such
is
the
history
of
many
other
noble
hearts
on
the
of
december
charlet
did
not
hesitate
in
the
face
of
the
many
crimes
combined
in
the
infamous
deed
of
louis
bonaparte
charlet
felt
the
law
stirring
within
him
he
reflected
that
he
ought
to
be
the
more
severe
because
he
was
one
of
those
whose
trust
had
been
most
betrayed
he
clearly
understood
that
there
remained
but
one
duty
for
the
citizen
a
bounden
duty
inseparable
from
the
law
to
defend
the
republic
and
the
constitution
and
to
resist
by
every
means
the
man
whom
the
left
but
still
more
his
own
crime
had
outlawed
the
refugees
from
switzerland
passed
the
frontier
in
arms
crossed
the
rh√¥ne
near
anglefort
and
entered
the
department
of
the
ain
charlet
joined
their
ranks
at
seyssel
the
little
troop
fell
in
with
the
officers
the
latter
voluntary
or
misled
accomplices
of
the
chose
to
resist
their
passage
a
conflict
ensued
one
of
the
officers
was
killed
and
charlet
was
made
prisoner
the
brought
charlet
before
a
he
was
charged
with
the
death
of
the
officer
which
after
all
was
but
an
incident
of
war
at
all
events
charlet
was
innocent
of
that
death
the
officer
was
killed
by
a
bullet
and
charlet
had
no
weapon
but
a
sharpened
file
charlet
would
not
recognize
as
a
lawful
court
the
body
of
men
who
pretended
to
sit
in
judgment
on
him
he
said
to
them
you
are
no
judges
where
is
the
law
the
law
is
on
my
side
he
refused
to
answer
them
questioned
on
the
subject
of
the
officer
death
he
could
have
cleared
up
the
whole
matter
by
a
single
word
but
to
descend
to
an
explanation
would
to
a
certain
extent
have
been
a
recognition
of
the
tribunal
he
did
not
choose
to
recognize
it
so
he
held
his
peace
these
men
condemned
him
to
die
according
to
the
usual
mode
of
criminal
executions
the
sentence
pronounced
he
seemed
to
have
been
forgotten
days
weeks
months
elapsed
everybody
about
the
prison
said
to
charlet
you
are
safe
on
the
of
june
at
break
of
day
the
town
of
belley
saw
a
mournful
sight
the
scaffold
had
risen
from
the
earth
during
the
night
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
public
square
the
people
accosted
one
another
pale
as
death
and
asked
have
you
seen
what
there
is
in
the
square
yes
whom
is
it
for
it
was
for
charlet
the
sentence
of
death
had
been
referred
to
bonaparte
it
had
slumbered
a
long
time
at
the
√©lys√©e
there
was
other
business
to
attend
to
but
one
fine
morning
after
a
lapse
of
seven
months
all
the
world
having
forgotten
the
conflict
at
seyssel
the
slain
officer
and
charlet
himself
bonaparte
wanting
most
likely
to
insert
some
event
between
the
festival
of
the
of
may
and
the
festival
of
the
of
august
signed
the
warrant
for
the
execution
on
the
of
june
therefore
only
a
few
days
ago
charlet
was
removed
from
his
prison
they
told
him
he
was
about
to
die
he
continued
calm
a
man
who
has
justice
on
his
side
does
not
fear
death
for
he
feels
that
there
are
two
things
within
him
one
his
body
which
may
be
put
to
death
the
other
justice
whose
hands
are
not
bound
nor
does
its
head
fall
beneath
the
knife
they
wanted
to
make
charlet
ride
in
a
cart
no
said
he
to
the
gendarmes
i
will
go
on
foot
i
can
walk
i
am
not
afraid
there
was
a
great
crowd
along
his
route
every
one
in
the
town
knew
him
and
loved
him
his
friends
sought
his
eye
charlet
his
arms
fastened
behind
his
back
bowed
his
head
right
and
left
adieu
jacques
adieu
pierre
said
he
smiling
adieu
charlet
they
answered
and
all
of
them
wept
the
gendarmerie
and
the
infantry
surrounded
the
scaffold
he
ascended
it
with
slow
and
steady
steps
when
they
saw
him
standing
on
the
scaffold
a
shudder
ran
through
the
crowd
the
women
cried
aloud
the
men
clenched
their
fists
while
they
were
strapping
him
to
the
plank
he
looked
up
at
the
knife
saying
when
i
reflect
that
i
was
once
a
bonapartist
then
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
exclaimed
vive
la
r√©publique
the
next
moment
his
head
fell
it
was
a
day
of
mourning
at
belley
and
through
all
the
villages
of
the
ain
how
did
he
die
people
would
bravely
god
be
praised
in
this
wise
a
man
has
been
killed
the
mind
succumbs
and
is
lost
in
horror
in
presence
of
a
deed
so
damnable
this
crime
being
added
to
the
rest
complements
and
sets
a
sinister
sort
of
seal
upon
them
it
is
more
than
the
complement
it
is
the
crowning
act
one
feels
that
bonaparte
ought
to
be
satisfied
to
have
shot
down
at
night
in
the
dark
in
solitude
on
the
under
the
arches
of
the
bridges
behind
a
lonely
wall
at
random
haphazard
no
matter
whom
unknown
persons
shadows
the
very
number
of
whom
none
can
tell
to
cause
nameless
persons
to
be
slain
by
nameless
persons
and
to
have
all
this
vanish
in
obscurity
in
oblivion
is
in
very
truth
far
from
gratifying
to
one
it
looks
like
hiding
one
self
and
in
truth
that
is
what
it
is
it
is
commonplace
scrupulous
men
have
the
right
to
say
to
you
you
know
you
are
afraid
you
would
not
dare
to
do
these
things
publicly
you
shrink
from
your
own
acts
and
to
a
certain
extent
they
seem
to
be
right
to
shoot
down
people
by
night
is
a
violation
of
every
law
human
and
divine
but
it
lacks
audacity
one
does
not
feel
triumphant
afterwards
something
better
is
possible
broad
daylight
the
public
square
the
judicial
scaffold
the
regular
apparatus
of
social
vengeance
to
hand
the
innocent
over
to
these
to
put
them
to
death
in
this
manner
ah
that
is
different
i
can
understand
that
to
commit
a
murder
at
high
noon
in
the
heart
of
the
town
by
means
of
one
machine
called
court
or
and
of
another
machine
slowly
erected
by
a
carpenter
adjusted
put
together
screwed
and
greased
at
pleasure
to
say
it
shall
be
at
such
an
hour
then
to
display
two
baskets
and
say
this
one
is
for
the
body
that
other
for
the
head
at
the
appointed
time
to
bring
the
victim
bound
with
ropes
attended
by
a
priest
to
proceed
calmly
to
the
murder
to
order
a
clerk
to
prepare
a
report
of
it
to
surround
the
murder
victim
with
gendarmes
and
naked
swords
so
that
the
people
there
may
shudder
and
no
longer
know
what
they
see
and
wonder
whether
those
men
in
uniform
are
a
brigade
of
gendarmerie
or
a
band
of
robbers
and
ask
one
another
looking
at
the
man
who
lets
the
knife
fall
whether
he
is
the
executioner
or
whether
he
is
not
rather
an
assassin
this
is
bold
and
resolute
this
is
a
parody
of
legal
procedure
most
audacious
and
alluring
and
worth
being
carried
out
this
is
a
noble
and
blow
on
the
cheek
of
justice
commend
us
to
this
to
do
this
seven
months
after
the
struggle
in
cold
blood
to
no
purpose
as
an
omission
that
one
repairs
as
a
duty
that
one
fulfills
is
it
is
complete
one
has
the
appearance
of
acting
within
one
rights
which
perplexes
the
conscience
and
makes
honest
men
shudder
a
terrible
juxtaposition
which
comprehends
the
whole
case
here
are
two
men
a
and
a
prince
the
prince
commits
a
crime
he
enters
the
tuileries
the
does
his
duty
he
ascends
the
scaffold
who
set
up
the
scaffold
the
prince
yes
this
man
who
had
he
been
beaten
in
december
could
have
escaped
the
death
penalty
only
by
the
omnipotence
of
progress
and
by
an
enlargement
too
liberal
certainly
of
the
principle
that
human
life
is
sacred
this
man
this
louis
bonaparte
this
prince
who
carries
the
practices
of
poulmann
and
soufflard
into
politics
he
it
is
who
rebuilds
the
scaffold
nor
does
he
tremble
nor
does
he
turn
pale
nor
does
he
feel
that
it
is
a
fatal
ladder
that
he
is
at
liberty
to
refrain
from
erecting
it
but
that
when
once
it
is
erected
he
is
not
at
liberty
to
take
it
down
and
that
he
who
sets
it
up
for
another
afterwards
finds
it
for
himself
it
knows
him
again
and
says
to
him
thou
didst
place
me
here
and
i
have
awaited
thee
no
this
man
does
not
reflect
he
has
longings
he
has
whims
and
they
must
be
satisfied
they
are
the
longings
of
a
dictator
unlimited
power
would
be
tasteless
without
this
seasoning
go
to
cut
off
head
and
the
others
bonaparte
is
of
the
french
republic
bonaparte
has
sixteen
millions
a
year
thousand
francs
a
day
cooks
in
his
household
and
as
many
he

and
of

in
the

every

and
the
arm
of
the
marchioness
of
douglas
on
which
to
enter
the
ballroom
but
all
this
is
not
enough
he
must
have
the
guillotine
to
boot
he
must
have
some
of
those
red
baskets
among
his
baskets
of
champagne
oh
hide
we
our
faces
with
both
our
hands
this
man
this
hideous
butcher
of
the
law
and
of
justice
still
had
his
apron
round
his
waist
and
his
hands
in
the
smoking
bowels
of
the
constitution
and
his
feet
in
the
blood
of
all
the
slaughtered
laws
when
you
judges
when
you
magistrates
men
of
the
law
men
of
the
right
but
i
pause
i
shall
meet
you
hereafter
with
your
black
robes
and
your
red
robes
your
robes
of
the
colour
of
ink
and
your
robes
of
the
colour
of
blood
and
i
shall
find
them
too
and
having
chastised
them
once
will
chastise
them
again
those
lieutenants
of
yours
those
judicial
supporters
of
the
ambuscade
those
soilers
of
the
ermine
baroche
suin
royer
mongis
rouher
and
troplong
deserters
from
the
law
all
those
names
which
signify
nothing
more
than
the
utmost
contempt
which
man
can
feel
if
he
did
not
crush
his
victims
between
two
boards
like
christiern
ii
if
he
did
not
bury
people
alive
like
ludovic
the
moor
if
he
did
not
build
his
palace
walls
with
living
men
and
stones
like
who
was
born
says
the
legend
with
his
hands
closed
and
full
of
blood
if
he
did
not
rip
open
pregnant
women
like
c√¶sar
borgia
duke
of
valentinois
if
he
did
not
scourge
women
on
the
breasts
like
ferdinand
of
toledo
if
he
did
not
break
on
the
wheel
alive
burn
alive
boil
alive
flay
alive
crucify
impale
and
quarter
blame
him
not
the
fault
was
not
his
the
age
obstinately
refuses
to
allow
it
he
has
done
all
that
was
humanly
or
inhumanly
possible
given
the
nineteenth
century
a
century
of
gentleness
of
decadence
say
the
papists
and
friends
of
arbitrary
power
louis
bonaparte
has
equalled
in
ferocity
his
contemporaries
haynau
radetzky
filangieri
schwartzenberg
and
ferdinand
of
naples
he
has
even
surpassed
them
a
rare
merit
with
which
we
must
credit
him
as
another
impediment
the
scene
was
laid
in
france
let
us
do
him
this
justice
in
the
times
in
which
we
live
ludovic
sforza
the
valentinois
the
duke
of
alva
timour
and
christiern
ii
would
have
done
no
more
than
louis
bonaparte
in
their
time
he
would
have
done
all
that
they
did
in
our
time
just
as
they
were
about
to
erect
their
gibbets
their
wheels
their
wooden
horses
their
cranes
their
living
towers
their
crosses
and
their
stakes
they
would
have
desisted
like
him
in
spite
of
themselves
and
unconsciously
before
the
secret
and
invincible
resistance
of
the
moral
environment
of
that
formidable
and
mysterious
interdiction
of
an
entire
epoch
which
rises
in
the
north
the
south
the
east
and
the
west
to
confront
tyrants
and
says
no
to
them
iii
what
would
have
been
but
had
it
not
been
for
this
abominable
of
december
which
its
accomplices
and
after
them
its
dupes
call
necessary
what
would
have
occurred
in
france
mon
dieu
this
let
us
go
back
a
little
and
review
in
a
summary
way
the
situation
as
it
was
before
the
the
party
of
the
past
under
the
name
of
order
opposed
the
republic
or
in
other
words
opposed
the
future
whether
opposed
or
not
whether
assented
to
or
not
the
republic
all
illusions
apart
is
the
future
proximate
or
remote
but
inevitable
of
the
nations
how
is
the
republic
to
be
established
there
are
two
ways
of
establishing
it
by
strife
and
by
progress
the
democrats
would
arrive
at
it
by
progress
their
adversaries
the
men
of
the
past
appear
to
desire
to
arrive
at
it
by
strife
as
we
have
just
observed
the
men
of
the
past
are
for
resisting
they
persist
they
apply
the
axe
to
the
tree
expecting
to
stop
the
mounting
sap
they
lavish
their
strength
their
puerility
and
their
anger
let
us
not
utter
a
single
bitter
word
against
our
old
adversaries
fallen
with
ourselves
on
the
same
day
and
several
among
them
with
honour
on
their
side
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
noting
that
it
was
into
this
struggle
that
the
majority
of
the
legislative
assembly
of
france
entered
at
the
very
beginning
of
its
career
in
the
month
of
may
this
policy
of
resistance
is
a
deplorable
policy
this
struggle
between
man
and
his
maker
is
inevitably
vain
but
though
void
of
result
it
is
fruitful
in
catastrophes
that
which
ought
to
be
will
be
that
which
ought
to
flow
will
flow
that
which
ought
to
fall
will
fall
that
which
ought
to
spring
up
will
spring
up
that
which
ought
to
grow
will
grow
but
obstruct
these
natural
laws
confusion
follows
disorder
begins
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
it
was
this
disorder
which
was
called
order
tie
up
a
vein
and
sickness
ensues
clog
up
a
stream
and
the
water
overflows
obstruct
the
future
and
revolutions
break
out
persist
in
preserving
among
you
as
if
it
were
alive
the
past
which
is
dead
and
you
produce
an
indescribable
moral
cholera
corruption
spreads
abroad
it
is
in
the
air
we
breathe
it
entire
classes
of
society
the
public
officials
for
instance
fall
into
decay
keep
dead
bodies
in
your
houses
the
plague
will
break
out
this
policy
inevitably
makes
blind
those
who
adopt
it
those
men
who
dub
themselves
statesmen
do
not
understand
that
they
themselves
have
made
with
their
own
hands
and
with
untold
labour
and
with
the
sweat
of
their
brows
the
terrible
events
they
deplore
and
that
the
very
catastrophes
which
fall
upon
them
were
by
them
constructed
what
would
be
said
of
a
peasant
who
should
build
a
dam
from
one
side
of
a
river
to
the
other
in
front
of
his
cottage
and
who
when
he
saw
the
river
turned
into
a
torrent
overflow
sweep
away
his
wall
and
carry
off
his
roof
should
exclaim
wicked
river
the
statesmen
of
the
past
those
great
builders
of
dams
across
streams
spend
their
time
in
exclaiming
wicked
people
take
away
polignac
and
the
july
ordinances
that
is
to
say
the
dam
and
charles
x
would
have
died
at
the
tuileries
reform
in
the
electoral
laws
that
is
to
say
once
more
take
away
the
dam
and
louis
philippe
would
have
died
on
the
throne
do
i
mean
thereby
that
the
republic
would
not
have
come
not
so
the
republic
we
repeat
is
the
future
it
would
have
come
but
step
by
step
successive
progress
by
progress
conquest
by
conquest
like
a
river
that
flows
and
not
like
a
deluge
that
overflows
it
would
have
come
at
its
own
hour
when
all
was
ready
for
it
it
would
have
come
certainly
not
more
enduring
for
it
is
already
indestructible
but
more
tranquil
free
from
all
possibility
of
reaction
with
no
princes
keeping
watch
with
no
behind
the
policy
which
obstructs
the
progress
of
mankind
let
us
insist
on
this
point
excels
in
producing
artificial
floods
thus
it
had
managed
to
render
the
year
a
sort
of
formidable
eventuality
and
this
again
by
the
same
contrivance
by
means
of
a
dam
here
is
a
railway
a
train
will
pass
in
an
hour
throw
a
beam
across
the
rails
and
when
the
train
comes
to
that
point
it
will
be
wrecked
as
it
was
at
fampoux
remove
the
beam
before
the
train
arrives
and
it
will
pass
without
even
suspecting
the
catastrophe
recently
lurking
there
this
beam
is
the
law
of
the
of
may
the
leaders
of
the
majority
of
the
legislative
assembly
had
thrown
it
across
and
they
cried
this
is
where
society
will
be
crushed
the
left
replied
take
away
your
beam
and
let
universal
suffrage
pass
unobstructed
this
is
the
whole
history
of
the
law
of
the
of
may
these
are
things
for
children
to
understand
but
which
statesmen
do
not
understand
now
let
us
answer
the
question
we
just
now
proposed
without
the
of
december
what
would
have
occurred
in
revoke
the
law
of
the
of
may
take
away
the
dam
from
before
the
people
deprive
bonaparte
of
his
lever
his
weapon
his
pretext
let
universal
suffrage
alone
take
the
beam
off
the
rails
and
do
you
know
what
you
would
have
had
in
nothing
elections
a
sort
of
peaceful
sundays
when
the
people
would
have
come
forward
to
vote
labourers
yesterday
today
electors
labourers
and
always
sovereign
somebody
rejoins
oh
yes
elections
you
talk
very
glibly
about
them
but
what
about
the
chamber
which
would
have
sprung
from
these
elections
did
they
not
announce
that
the
constitution
of
would
prove
a
red
chamber
red
chambers
red
hobgoblins
all
such
predictions
are
of
equal
value
those
who
wave
such
phantasmagorias
on
the
end
of
a
stick
before
the
terrified
populace
know
well
what
they
are
doing
and
laugh
behind
the
ghastly
rag
they
wave
beneath
the
long
scarlet
robe
of
the
phantom
to
which
had
been
given
the
name
of
we
see
the
stout
boots
of
the
iv
the
jacquerie
meanwhile
after
the
of
december
the
crime
being
committed
it
was
imperative
to
mislead
public
opinion
the
began
to
shriek
about
the
jacquerie
like
the
assassin
who
cried
stop
thief
we
may
add
that
a
had
been
promised
and
that
bonaparte
could
not
break
all
his
promises
at
once
without
some
inconvenience
what
but
the
jacquerie
was
the
red
spectre
some
reality
must
be
imparted
to
that
spectre
one
can
not
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
in
the
face
of
a
whole
people
and
say
it
was
nothing

yourselves
consequently
there

the
promises
of

were
observed
the
imaginations
of
his
entourage
gave
themselves
a
free
rein
that
old
bugbear
mother
goose
was
resuscitated
and
many
a
child
on
reading
the
newspaper
might
have
recognized
the
ogre
of
goodman
perrault
in
the
disguise
of
a
socialist
they
surmised
they
invented
the
press
being
suppressed
it
was
quite
easy
it
is
easy
to
lie
when
the
tongue
of
contradiction
has
been
torn
out
beforehand
they
exclaimed
citizens
be
on
your
guard
without
us
you
were
lost
we
shot
you
but
that
was
for
your
good
behold
the
lollards
were
at
your
gates
the
anabaptists
were
scaling
your
walls
the
hussites
were
knocking
at
your
the
lean
and
hungry
were
climbing
your
staircases
the
coveted
your
dinner
be
on
your
guard
have
not
some
of
your
good
women
been
outraged
they
gave
the
floor
to
one
of
the
principal
writers
in
one
froissard
i
dare
not
write
or
describe
the
horrible
and
improper
things
they
did
to
the
ladies
but
among
other
disorderly
and
villainous
injuries
they
killed
a
chevalier
and
put
a
spit
through
him
and
turned
him
before
the
fire
and
roasted
him
before
the
wife
and
her
children
after
ten
or
twelve
had
violated
the
woman
they
tried
to
make
her
and
the
children
eat
some
of
the
body
then
killed
them
put
them
to
an
evil
death
these
wicked
people
pillaged
and
burned
everything
they
killed
and
forced
and
violated
all
the
women
and
maidens
without
pity
or
mercy
as
if
they
were
mad
dogs
quite
in
the
same
manner
did
lawless
people
conduct
themselves
between
paris
and
noyon
between
paris
and
soissons
and
ham
in
vermandois
all
through
the
land
of
coucy
there
were
the
great
violators
and
malefactors
and
in
the
county
of
valois
in
the
bishopric
of
laon
of
soissons
and
of
noyon
they
destroyed
upwards
of
a
hundred
ch√¢teaux
and
goodly
houses
of
knights
and
squires
and
killed
and
robbed
all
they
met
but
by
his
grace
found
a
fit
remedy
for
which
all
praise
be
given
to
him
people
simply
substituted
for
god
monseigneur
le
they
could
do
no
less
now
that
eight
months
have
elapsed
we
know
what
to
think
of
this
jacquerie
the
facts
have
at
length
been
brought
to
light
where
how
why
before
the
very
tribunals
of
bonaparte
the
whose
wives
had
been
violated
were
single
men
the
cur√©s
who
had
been
roasted
alive
and
whose
hearts
jacques
had
eaten
have
written
to
say
that
they
are
quite
well
the
gendarmes
round
whose
bodies
others
had
danced
have
been
heard
as
witnesses
before
the
the
public
coffers
said
to
have
been
rifled
have
been
found
intact
in
the
hands
of
bonaparte
who
saved
them
the
famous
deficit
of
five
thousand
francs
at
clamecy
has
dwindled
down
to
two
hundred
expended
in
orders
for
bread
an
official
publication
had
said
on
the
of
december
the
cur√©
the
mayor
and
the
of
joigny
besides
several
gendarmes
have
been
basely
massacred
somebody
replied
to
this
in
a
letter
which
was
made
public
not
a
drop
of
blood
was
shed
at
joigny
nobody
life
was
threatened
now
by
whom
was
this
letter
written
this
same
mayor
of
joigny
who
had
been
henri
de
lacretelle
from
whom
an
armed
band
had
extorted
two
thousand
francs
at
his
ch√¢teau
of
cormatin
is
amazed
to
this
day
not
at
the
extortion
but
at
the
fable
de
lamartine
whom
another
band
had
intended
to
plunder
and
probably
to
hang
on
the
and
whose
ch√¢teau
of
was
burned
and
who
had
written
to
demand
government
assistance
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
until
he
saw
it
in
the
papers
the
following
document
was
produced
before
the
in
the

presided
over
by
martinprey
order
of
the

is
a
virtue
of
thief
and
plunderer
will
be

who
in
the
course
of
twelve
hours
shall
not
have
deposited
them
at
the

office
or
given
them
up
shall
be

and
confined
until
further

shall
be
disarmed
and
sent
to

the
social
revolutionary
committee
this
that
you
have
just
read
is
the
proclamation
of
jacques
death
to
the
pillagers
death
to
the
thieves
such
is
the
cry
of
these
thieves
and
pillagers
one
of
these
jacques
named
gustave
a
native
of
died
in
exile
at
brussels
on
the
of
may
bequeathing
one
hundred
thousand
francs
to
his
native
town
to
found
a
school
of
agriculture
this
partitioner
did
indeed
make
partition
there
was
not
then
and
the
honest
of
the
admit
it
now
to
their
intimates
with
playful
delight
there
was
not
any
jacquerie
it
is
true
but
the
trick
has
told
there
was
in
the
departments
as
there
was
in
paris
a
lawful
resistance
the
resistance
prescribed
to
the
citizens
by
article
of
the
constitution
and
superior
to
the
constitution
by
natural
right
there
was
the
legitimate
defence
this
time
the
word
is
properly
applied
against
the
preservers
the
armed
struggle
of
right
and
law
against
the
infamous
insurrection
of
the
ruling
powers
the
republic
surprised
by
an
ambuscade
wrestled
with
the
that
is
all
departments
rose
in
arms
the
ain
the
aude
the
cher
the
bouches
du
rh√¥ne
the
c√¥te
the
the
loiret
the
marne
the
meurthe
the
nord
the
the
rh√¥ne
did
their
duty
worthily
the
allier
the
the
aveyron
the
drome
the
gard
the
gers
the
h√©rault
the
jura
the
ni√®vre
the
the
var
and
vaucluse
did
theirs
fearlessly
they
succumbed
as
did
paris
the
was
as
ferocious
there
as
at
paris
we
have
cast
a
summary
glance
at
its
crimes
so
then
it
was
this
lawful
constitutional
virtuous
resistance
this
resistance
in
which
heroism
was
on
the
side
of
the
citizens
and
atrocity
on
the
side
of
the
powers
it
was
this
which
the
called
jacquerie
we
repeat
a
touch
of
red
spectre
was
useful
this
jacquerie
had
two
aims
it
served
the
policy
of
the
elys√©e
in
two
ways
it
offered
a
double
advantage
first
to
win
votes
for
the
plebiscite
to
win
these
votes
by
the
sword
and
in
face
of
the
spectre
to
repress
the
intelligent
to
alarm
the
credulous
compelling
some
by
terror
others
by
fear
as
we
shall
shortly
explain
therein
lies
all
the
success
and
mystery
of
the
vote
of
the
of
december
secondly
it
afforded
a
pretext
for
proscriptions
the
year
in
itself
contained
no
actual
danger
the
law
of
the
of
may
morally
extinct
was
dead
before
the
of
december
a
new
assembly
a
new
president
the
constitution
simply
put
in
operation
elections
and
nothing
more
but
it
was
necessary
that
bonaparte
should
go
there
was
the
obstacle
thence
the
catastrophe
thus
then
did
this
man
one
fine
morning
seize
by
the
throat
the
constitution
the
republic
the
law
and
france
he
stabbed
the
future
in
the
back
under
his
feet
he
trampled
law
common
sense
justice
reason
and
liberty
he
arrested
men
who
were
inviolable
he
sequestered
innocent
men
in
the
persons
of
their
representatives
he
seized
the
people
in
his
grip
he
raked
the
paris
boulevards
with
his
shot
he
made
his
cavalry
wallow
in
the
blood
of
old
men
and
of
women
he
shot
without
warning
and
without
trial
he
filled
mazas
the
conciergerie
vincennes
his
fortresses
his
cells
his
casemates
his
dungeons
with
prisoners
and
his
cemeteries
with
corpses
he
incarcerated
at
a
wife
who
was
carrying
bread
to
her
husband
in
hiding
he
sent
to
the
galleys
for
twenty
years
a
man
who
had
harboured
one
of
the
proscribed
he
tore
up
every
code
of
laws
broke
every
enactment
he
caused
the
deported
to
rot
by
thousands
in
the
horrible
holds
of
the
hulks
he
sent
to
lambessa
and
cayenne
one
hundred
and
fifty
children
between
twelve
and
fifteen
he
who
was
more
absurd
than
falstaff
has
become
more
terrible
than
richard
iii
and
why
has
all
this
been
done
because
there
was
he
said
a
plot
against
his
power
because
the
year
which
was
closing
had
a
treasonable
understanding
with
the
year
which
was
beginning
to
overthrow
him
because
article
perfidiously
concerted
with
the
calendar
to
turn
him
out
because
the
second
sunday
in
may
intended
to
depose
him
because
his
oath
had
the
audacity
to
plot
his
fall
because
his
plighted
word
conspired
against
him
the
day
after
his
triumph
he
was
heard
to
say
the
second
sunday
in
may
is
dead
no
it
is
probity
that
is
dead
it
is
honour
that
is
dead
it
is
the
name
of
emperor
that
is
dead
how
the
man
sleeping
in
the
chapel
of
jerome
must
shudder
how
he
must
despair
behold
the
gradual
rise
of
unpopularity
about
his
great
figure
and
it
is
this
nephew
who
has
placed
the
ladder
the
great
recollections
are
beginning
to
fade
the
bad
ones
are
returning
people
dare
no
longer
speak
of
jena
marengo
and
wagram
of
what
do
they
speak
of
the
duc
of
jaffa
of
the
brumaire
they
forget
the
hero
and
see
only
the
despot
caricature
is
beginning
to
sport
with
c√¶sar
profile
and
what
a
creature
beside
him
some
there
are
who
confound
the
nephew
with
the
uncle
to
the
delight
of
the
√©lys√©e
but
to
the
shame
of
france
the
parodist
assumes
the
airs
of
a
stage
manager
alas
a
splendour
so
infinite
could
not
be
tarnished
save
by
this
boundless
debasement
yes
worse
than
hudson
lowe
hudson
lowe
was
only
a
jailor
hudson
lowe
was
only
an
executioner
the
man
who
has
really
assassinated
napoleon
is
louis
bonaparte
hudson
lowe
killed
only
his
life
louis
bonaparte
is
killing
his
glory
ah
the
villain
he
takes
everything
he
abuses
everything
he
sullies
everything
he
dishonours
everything
he
selects
for
his
ambuscade
the
month
the
day
of
austerlitz
he
returns
from
satory
as
one
would
return
from
aboukir
he
conjures
out
of
the
of
december
i
know
not
what
bird
of
night
and
perches
it
on
the
standard
of
france
and
exclaims
soldiers
behold
the
eagle
he
borrows
the
hat
from
napoleon
and
the
plume
from
murat
he
has
his
imperial
etiquette
his
chamberlains
his
his
courtiers
under
the
emperor
they
were
kings
under
him
they
are
lackeys
he
has
his
own
policy
his
own
vend√©miaire
his
own
brumaire
yes
he
risks
comparison
at
the
√©lys√©e
napoleon
the
great
has
disappeared
they
say
the
man
of
destiny
has
outdone
g√©ronte
the
perfect
man
is
not
the
first
but
this
one
it
is
evident
that
the
first
came
only
to
make
the
second
bed
louis
bonaparte
in
the
midst
of
his
valets
and
concubines
to
satisfy
the
necessities
of
the
table
and

ah
frenchmen
look
upon
this
hog
covered
with
slime
strutting
about
in
that
lion
skin
book
v
parliamentarism
i
one
day
more
than
years
ago
the
french
people
who
had
been
the
property
of
one
family
for
upwards
of
eight
hundred
years
who
had
been
oppressed
by
the
barons
down
to
louis
xi
and
since
louis
xi
by
the
parliaments
that
is
to
say
to
employ
the
frank
remark
of
a
great
nobleman
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
had
been
half
eaten
up
by
wolves
and
finished
by
vermin
who
had
been
parcelled
into
provinces
into
ch√¢tellanies
into
bailiwicks
and
into
seneschalries
who
had
been
exploited
squeezed
taxed
fleeced
peeled
shaven
shorn
clipped
and
abused
without
mercy
fined
incessantly
at
the
good
pleasure
of
their
masters
governed
led
misled
overdriven
tortured
beaten
with
sticks
and
branded
with
irons
for
an
oath
sent
to
the
galleys
for
killing
a
rabbit
upon
the
king
grounds
hung
for
a
matter
of
five
sous
contributing
their
millions
to
versailles
and
their
skeletons
to
montfau√ßon
laden
with
prohibitions
with
ordinances
with
patents
with
royal
letters
with
edicts
pecuniary
and
rural
with
laws
with
codes
with
customs
ground
to

with

with

with
with

import
and
export
duties
rents

and
bankruptcies
cudgelled
with
a
cudgel
called
a
sceptre
gasping
sweating
groaning
always
marching
crowned
but
on
their
knees
rather
a
beast
of
burthen
than
a
nation
the
french
people
suddenly
stood
upright
determined
to
be
men
and
resolved
to
demand
an
account
of
providence
and
to
liquidate
those
eight
centuries
of
misery
it
was
a
noble
effort
ii
mirabeau
a
large
hall
was
chosen
which
was
surrounded
with
benches
then
they
took
boards
and
with
these
boards
constructed
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
a
kind
of
platform
when
this
platform
was
finished
what
in
those
days
was
called
the
nation
that
is
to
say
the
clergy
in
their
red
and
violet
robes
the
nobility
in
spotless
white
with
their
swords
at
their
sides
and
the
bourgeoisie
dressed
in
black
took
their
seats
upon
the
benches
scarcely
were
they
seated
when
there
was
seen
to
ascend
the
platform
and
there
take
its
stand
an
extraordinary
figure
who
is
this
monster
said
some
who
is
this
giant
said
others
it
was
a
singular
being
unforeseen
unknown
emerging
abruptly
from
the
obscurity
who
terrified
and
who
fascinated
a
dreadful
disease
had
given
him
a
kind
of
tiger
head
every
degree
of
ugliness
seemed
to
have
been
imprinted
upon
that
mask
by
every
possible
vice
like
the
bourgeoisie
he
was
dressed
in
black
that
is
to
say
in
mourning
his
bloodshot
eye
cast
upon
the
assembly
a
dazzling
glance
it
resembled
menace
and
reproach
all
looked
upon
him
with
a
degree
of
curiosity
in
which
was
mingled
horror
he
raised
his
hand
and
there
was
silence
then
were
heard
to
issue
from
this
hideous
face
sublime
words
it
was
the
voice
of
the
new
world
speaking
through
the
mouth
of
the
old
world
it
was
that
had
risen
and
was
questioning
and
accusing
and
denouncing
to
god
and
man
all
the
fatal
dates
of
the
monarchy
it
was
the
past
an
august
spectacle
the
past
bruised
with
chains
branded
on
the
shoulder
the
unfortunate
past
calling
aloud
upon
the
future
the
emancipating
future
that
is
what
that
stranger
was
that
is
what
he
did
on
that
platform
at
his
word
which
at
certain
moments
was
as
the
thunder
prejudices
fictions
abuses
superstitions
fallacies
intolerance
ignorance
fiscal
infamies
barbarous
punishments
outworn
authorities
magistracy
discrepit
codes
rotten
laws
everything
that
was
doomed
to
perish
trembled
and
the
downfall
of
those
things
began
that
formidable
apparition
has
left
a
name
in
the
memory
of
men
he
should
be
called
revolution
his
name
is
mirabeau
iii
the
tribune
from
the
moment
that
that
man
put
his
foot
upon
that
platform
that
platform
was
transformed
the
french
tribune
was
founded
the
french
tribune
a
volume
would
be
necessary
to
tell
all
that
that
word
contains
the
french
tribune
has
been
these
sixty
years
the
open
mouth
of
human
intelligence
of

raged
around

great
and
terrible
year
from
it
were
heard
those
ferocious
interruptions
aha
cries
an
orator
of
the
convention
do
you
propose
to
cut
short
my
speech
yes
answers
a
voice
and
your
neck
and
those
superb
apostrophes
minister

to
an
iniquitous
keeper
of
the
seals
i
condemn
you
on
leaving
this
room
to
contemplate
the
statue
of
there
every
cause
has
been
pleaded
as
we
have
said
before
bad
causes
as
well
as
good
the
good
only
have
been
finally
won
there
in
the
presence
of
resistance
of
denials
of
obstacles
those
who
long
for
the
future
like
those
who
long
for
the
past
have
lost
all
patience
there
it
has
happened
to
truth
to
become
violent
and
to
falsehood
to
rage
there
all
extremes
have
appeared
on
that
tribune
the
guillotine
had
its
orator
marat
and
the
inquisition
its
montalembert
terrorism
in
the
name
of
public
safety
terrorism
in
the
name
of
rome
gall
in
the
mouths
of
both
agony
in
the
audience
when
one
was
speaking
you
fancied
you
saw
the
gleam
of
the
knife
when
the
other
was
speaking
you
fancied
you
heard
the
crackling
of
the
stake
there
factions
have
fought
all
with
determination
a
few
with
glory
there
the
royal
power
violated
the
right
of
the
people
in
the
person
of
manuel
become
illustrious
in
history
by
this
very
violation
there
appeared
disdaining
the
past
whose
servants
they
were
two
melancholy
old
men
disdainful

the
satirical
genius
there

wrestled
with
guizot
strength
there
men
have
mingled
have
grappled
have

have
brandished
evidence
like
a
sword
there
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
hatred
rage
superstition
egotism
imposture
shrieking
hissing
barking
writhing
screaming
always
the
same
calumnies
shaking
always
the
same
clenched

spitting
since
christ
the
same
saliva
have
whirled
like
a
about
thy
serene
face
o

iv
the
orators
all
this
was
alive
ardent
fruitful
tumultuous
grand
and
when
everything
had
been
pleaded
argued
investigated
searched
gone
to
the
bottom
of
said
and
gainsaid
what
came
forth
from
the
chaos
always
the
spark
what
came
forth
from
the
cloud
always
light
all
that
the
tempest
could
do
was
to
agitate
the
ray
of
light
and
change
it
into
lightning
there
in
that
tribune
has
been
propounded
analyzed
clarified
and
almost
always
determined
every
question
of
the
day
questions
of
finance
questions
of
credit
questions
of
labour
questions
of
circulation
questions
of
salary
questions
of
state
questions
of
the
land
questions
of
peace
questions
of
war
there
for
the
first
time
was
pronounced
that
phrase
which
contained
a
whole
new
alignment
of
society
the
rights
of
man
there
for
fifty
years
has
been
heard
the
ringing
of
the
anvil
upon
which
supernatural
smiths
were
forging
pure
ideas
ideas
those
swords
of
the
people
those
lances
of
justice
that
armour
of
law
there
suddenly
impregnated
with
sympathetic
currents
like
embers
which
redden
in
the
wind
all
those
who
had
flame
in
their
hearts
great
advocates
like
and
berryer
great
historians
like
guizot
great
poets
like
lamartine
rose
at
once
and
naturally
into
great
orators
that
tribune
was
a
place
of
strength
and
of
virtue
it
saw
it
inspired
for
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
these
emanations
sprang
from
it
all
those
acts
of
devotion
of
abnegation
of
energy
of
intrepidity
as
for
us
we
honour
every
display
of
courage
even
in
the
ranks
of
those
who
are
opposed
to
us
one
day
the
tribune
was
surrounded
with
darkness
it
seemed
as
if
an
abyss
had
opened
around
it
and
in
this
darkness
one
heard
a
noise
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
suddenly
in
that
impenetrable
night
above
that
ledge
of
marble
to
which
clung
the
strong
hand
of
danton
one
saw
arise
a
pike
bearing
a
bleeding
head
boissy
saluted
it
that
was
a
day
of
menace
but
the
people
do
not
overthrow
tribunes
the
tribunes
belong
to
the
people
and
the
people
know
it
place
a
tribune
in
the
centre
of
the
world
and
in
a
few
days
in
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
the
republic
will
arise
the
tribune
shines
for
the
people
and
they
are
not
unaware
of
it
sometimes
the
tribune
irritates
the
people
and
makes
them
foam
with
rage
sometimes
they
beat
it
with
their
waves
they
overflow
it
even
as
on
the
of
may
but
then
they
retire
majestically
like
the
ocean
and
leave
it
standing
upright
like
a
beacon
to
overthrow
the
tribune
is
on
the
part
of
the
people
rank
folly
it
is
the
proper
work
of
tyrants
only
the
people
were
rising
full
of
anger
of
irritation
some
generous
error
had
seized
them
some
illusion
was
leading
them
astray
they
had
misunderstood
some
act
some
measure
some
law
they
were
beginning
to
be
wroth
they
were
laying
aside
that
superb
tranquillity
wherein
their
strength
consists
they
were
invading
all
the
public
squares
with
dull
murmurings
and
formidable
gestures
it
was
an
√©meute
an
insurrection
civil
war
a
revolution
perhaps
the
tribune
was
there
a
beloved
voice
arose
and
said
to
the
people
pause
look
listen
judge
forte
virum
quem
conspexere
this
was
true
at
rome
and
true
at
paris
the
people
paused
o
tribune
pedestal
of
men
of
might
from
thee
have
sprung
eloquence

devotion
and
great
thoughts

the
muzzles
of
lions
in
sixty
years
every
sort
of
mind
every
sort
of
intelligence
every
description
of
genius
has
successively
spoken
in
that
spot
the
most
resonant
in
the
world
from
the
first
constituent
assembly
to
the
last
from
the
first
legislative

to

if
you
can
it
is
a
catalogue
worthy
of

follow
the
series
how
many
contrasting
figures
are
there
from

let
us
insist
upon
this
point
starting
from
mirabeau
there
was
in
the
world
in
human
society
in
civilization
a
culminating
point
a
central
spot
a
common
altar
a
summit
this
summit
was
the
tribune
of
france
admirable
landmark
for
coming
generations
a
glittering
height
in
time
of
peace
a
lighthouse
in
the
darkness
of
catastrophes
from
the
extremities
of
the
intelligent
world
the
peoples
fixed
their
eyes
upon
this
peak
from
which
has
shone
the
human
mind
when
dark
night
suddenly
enveloped
them
they
heard
issuing
from
that
height
a
mighty
voice
which
spoke
to
them
in
the
darkness
et
magna
testatur
voce
per
a
voice
which
all
at
once
when
the
hour
had
come
like
the
cockcrow
announcing
the
dawn
like
the
cry
of
the
eagle
hailing
the
sun
resounded
like
a
clarion
of
war
or
like
the
trumpet
of
judgment
and
brought
to
their
feet
once
more
waving
their
seeking
swords
in
their
tombs
all
those
heroic
dead
nations
poland
hungary
italy
then
at
that
voice
of
france
the
glorious
sky
of
the
future
opened
old
despotisms
blinded
and
in
fear
hid
their
heads
in
the
nether
darkness
and
there
her
feet
upon
the
clouds
her
forehead
among
the
stars
a
sword
flashing
in
her
hand
her
mighty
wings
outspread
in
the
azure
depths
one
saw
liberty
appear
the
archangel
of
the
nations
v
influence
of
oratory
this
tribune
was
the
terror
of
every
tyranny
and
fanaticism
it
was
the
hope
of
every
one
who
was
oppressed
under
heaven
whoever
placed
his
foot
upon
that
height
felt
distinctly
the
pulsations
of
the
great
heart
of
mankind
there
providing
he
was
a
man
of
earnest
purpose
his
soul
swelled
within
him
and
shone
without
a
breath
of
universal
philanthropy
seized
him
and
filled
his
mind
as
the
breeze
fills
the
sail
so
long
as
his
feet
rested
upon
those
four
planks
he
was
a
stronger
and
a
better
man
he
felt
at
that
consecrated
minute
as
if
he
were
living
the
life
of
all
the
nations
words
of
charity
for
all
men
came
to
his
lips
beyond
the
assembly
grouped
at
his
feet
and
frequently
in
a
tumult
he
beheld
the
people
attentive
serious
with
ears
strained
and
fingers
on
lips
and
beyond
the
people
the
human
race
plunged
in
thought
seated
in
circles
and
listening
such
was
this
grand
tribune
from
which
a
man
addressed
the
world
from
this
tribune
incessantly
vibrating
gushed
forth
perpetually
a
sort
of
sonorous
flood
a
mighty
oscillation
of
sentiments
and
ideas
which
from
billow
to
billow
and
from
people
to
people
flowed
to
the
utmost
confines
of
the
earth
to
set
in
motion
those
intelligent
waves
which
are
called
souls
frequently
one
knew
not
why
such
and
such
a
law
such
and
such
an
institution
was
tottering
beyond
the
frontiers
beyond
the
most
distant
seas
the
papacy
beyond
the
alps
the
throne
of
the
czar
at
the
extremity
of
europe
slavery
in
america
the
death
penalty
all
over
the
world
the
reason
was
that
the
tribune
of
france
had
quivered
at
certain
hours
the
quiver
of
that
tribune
was
an
earthquake
the
tribune
of
france
spoke
and
every
sentient
being
on
this
earth
betook
itself
to
reflection
the
words
sped
into
the
obscurity
through
space
at
hazard
no
matter
where
it
is
only
the
wind
it
is
only
a
little
noise
said
the
barren
minds
that
live
upon
irony
but
the
next
day
or
three
months
or
a
year
later
something
fell
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
or
something
rose
what
had
been
the
cause
of
that
the
noise
that
had
vanished
the
wind
that
had
passed
away
this
noise
this
wind
was
the
word
a
sacred
force
from
the
word
of
god
came
the
creation
of
human
beings
from
the
word
of
man
will
spring
the
union
of
the
peoples
vi
what
an
orator
is
once
mounted
upon
this
tribune
the
man
who
was
there
was
no
longer
a
man
he
was
that
mysterious
workman
whom
we
see
at
twilight
walking
with
long
strides
across
the
furrows
and
flinging
into
space
with
an
imperial
gesture
the
germs
the
seeds
the
future
harvests
the
wealth
of
the
approaching
summer
bread
life
he
goes
to
and
fro
he
returns
his
hand
opens
and
empties
itself
fills
itself
and
empties
itself
again
and
again
the
sombre
plain
is
stirred
the
deeps
of
nature
open
the
unknown
abyss
of
creation
begins
its
work
the
waiting
dews
fall
the
spear
of
wild
grain
quivers
and
reflects
that
the
sheaf
of
wheat
will
succeed
it
the
sun
hidden
behind
the
horizon
loves
what
that
workman
is
doing
and
knows
that
his
rays
will
not
be
wasted
sacred
and
mysterious
work
the
orator
is
the
sower
he
takes
from
his
heart
his
instincts
his
passions
his
beliefs
his
sufferings
his
dreams
his
ideas
and
throws
them
by
handfuls
into
the
midst
of
men
every
brain
is
to
him
an
open
furrow
one
word
dropped
from
the
tribune
always
takes
root
somewhere
and
becomes
a
thing
you
say
oh
it
is
nothing
it
is
a
man
talking
and
you
shrug
your
shoulders
shortsighted
creatures
it
is
a
future
which
is
germinating
it
is
a
new
world
bursting
into
bloom
vii
what
the
tribune
accomplished
two
great
problems
hang
over
the
world
war
must
disappear
and
conquest
must
continue
these
two
necessities
of
a
growing
civilization
seemed
to
exclude
each
other
how
satisfy
the
one
without
failing
the
other
who
could
solve
the
two
problems
at
the
same
time
who
did
solve
them
the
tribune
the
tribune
is
peace
and
the
tribune
is
conquest
conquest
by
the
sword
who
wants
it
nobody
the
peoples
are
fatherlands
conquest
by
ideas
who
wants
it
everybody
the
peoples
are
mankind
now
two
pre√´minent
tribunes
dominated
the
nations
the
english
tribune
doing
business
and
the
french
tribune
creating
ideas
the
french
tribune
had
elaborated
after
all
the
principles
which
form
the
political
philosopher
stone
and
it
had
begun
to
elaborate
since
all
the
principles
which
form
the
social
stone
when
once
a
principle
had
been
released
from
confinement
and
brought
into
the
light
the
french
tribune
threw
it
upon
the
world
armed
from
head
to
foot
saying
go
the
victorious
principle
took
the
field
met
the
officers
on
the
frontier
and
passed
in
spite
of
their
met
the
sentinels
at
the
gates
of
cities
and
passed
despite
their
travelled
by
railway
by
scoured
continents
crossed
the
seas
accosted
wayfarers
on
the
highway
sat
at
the
firesides
of
families
glided
between
friend
and
friend
between
brother
and
brother
between
man
and
wife
between
master
and
slave
between
people
and
king
and
to
those
who
asked
who
art
thou
it
replied
i
am
the
truth
and
to
those
who
asked
whence
comest
thou
it
replied
i
come
from
france
then
he
who
had
questioned
the
principle
offered
it
his
hand
and
it
was
better
than
the
annexation
of
a
province
it
was
the
annexation
of
a
human
mind
thenceforth
between
paris
the
metropolis
and
that
man
in
his
solitude
and
that
town
buried
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
or
of
the
steppes
and
that
people
groaning
under
the
yoke
a
current
of
thought
and
of
love
was
established
under
the
influence
of
these
currents
certain
nationalities
grew
weak
whilst
others
waxed
strong
and
rose
again
the
savage
felt
himself
less
savage
the
turk
less
turk
the
russian
less
russian
the
hungarian
more
hungarian
the
italian
more
italian
slowly
and
by
degrees
the
french
spirit
assimilated
the
other
nations
for
universal
progress
thanks
to
this
admirable
french
language
composed
by
providence
with
wonderful
equilibrium
of
enough
consonants
to
be
pronounced
by
the
nations
of
the
north
and
of
enough
vowels
to
be
pronounced
by
the
peoples
of
the
south
thanks
to
this
language
which
is
a
power
of
civilization
and
of
humanity
little
by
little
and
by
its
radiation
alone
this
lofty
central
tribune
of
paris
conquered
the
nations
and
made
them
france
the
material
boundary
of
france
was
such
as
she
could
make
it
but
there
were
no
treaties
of
to
determine
her
moral
frontier
the
moral
frontier
constantly
receded
and
broadened
from
day
to
day
and
before
a
quarter
of
a
century
perhaps
one
would
have
said
the
french
world
as
one
said
the
roman
world
that
is
what
the
tribune
was
that
is
what
it
was
accomplishing
for
france
a
prodigious
engine
of
ideas
a
gigantic
factory
ever
elevating
the
level
of
intelligence
all
over
the
world
and
infusing
into
the
heart
of
humanity
a
vast
flood
of
light
and
this
is
what
bonaparte
has
suppressed
viii
parliamentarism
yes
that
tribune
bonaparte
has
overthrown
that
power
created
by
our
revolutionary
parturition
he
has
broken
shattered
crushed
torn
with
his
bayonets
thrown
under
the
feet
of
horses
his
uncle
uttered
an
aphorism
the
throne
is
a
board
covered
with
velvet
he
also
has
uttered
his
the
tribune
is
a
board
covered
with
cloth
on
which
we
read
egalit√©
he
has
thrown
board
and
cloth
and
liberty
and
equality
and
fraternity
into
the
fire
of
a
bivouac
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
soldiers
a
little
smoke
and
all
was
over
is
it
true
is
it
possible
did
it
happen
so
has
such
a
thing
been
seen
in
these
days
mon
dieu
yes
it
is
in
fact
extremely
simple
to
cut
off
the
head
of
cicero
and
nail
his
two
hands
upon
the
rostrum
it
sufficed
to
have
a
brute
who
has
a
knife
and
another
brute
who
has
nails
and
a
hammer
the
tribune
was
for
france
three
things
a
means
of
exterior
initiative
a
method
of
interior
government
a
source
of
glory
louis
bonaparte
has
suppressed
the
initiative
france
was
the
teacher
of
the
peoples
and
conquered
them
by
love
to
what
end
he
has
suppressed
the
method
of
government
his
own
is
better
he
has
breathed
upon
the
glory
of
france
and
blown
it
out
certain
breaths
have
this
property
but
to
make
an
assault
upon
the
tribune
is
a
family
crime
the
first
bonaparte
had
already
committed
it
but
at
least
what
he
brought
into
france
to
replace
that
glory
was
glory
not
ignominy
louis
bonaparte
did
not
content
himself
with
overthrowing
the
tribune
he
determined
to
make
it
ridiculous
as
well
try
that
as
anything
else
the
least
one
can
do
when
one
can
not
utter
two
words
consecutively
when
one
harangues
only
with
written
notes
in
hand
when
one
is
short
both
of
speech
and
of
intelligence
is
to
make
a
little
fun
of
mirabeau
general
ratapoil
said
to
general
foy
hold
your
tongue
chatterbox
what
is
it
you
call
the
tribune
cries
bonaparte
louis
it
is
parliamentarism
what
have
you
to
say
to
parliamentarism
parliamentarism
pleases
me
parliamentarism
is
a
pearl
behold
the
dictionary
enriched
this
academician
of
makes
new
words
in
truth
one
is
not
a
barbarian
to
refrain
from
dropping
a
barbarism
now
and
then
he
too
is
a
sower
barbarisms
fructify
in
the
brains
of
idiots
the
uncle
had
ideologists
the
nephew
has
parliamentarisms
parliamentarism
gentlemen
parliamentarism
ladies
this
is
answerable
for
everything
you
venture
timidly
to
observe
it
is
perhaps
a
pity
so
many
families
have
been
ruined
so
many
people
transported
so
many
citizens
proscribed
so
many
coffins
filled
so
many
graves
dug
so
much
blood
spilt
aha
replies
a
coarse
voice
with
a
dutch
accent
so
you
mistrust
parliamentarism
do
you
get
out
of
the
dilemma
if
you
can
parliamentarism
is
a
great
find
i
give
my
vote
to
louis
bonaparte
for
the
next
vacant
seat
at
the
institute
what
that
why
we
must
encourage
neology
this
man
comes
from
the
this
man
comes
from
the
morgue
this
man
hands
steam
like
a
butcher
he
scratches
his
ear
smiles
and
invents
words
like
julie
he
marries
the
wit
of
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
to
the
odour
of
montfau√ßon
we
will
both
vote
for
him
wo
we
de
montalembert
ix
the

destroyed
so
parliamentarism
that
is
to
say
protection

movement
life
all
these
exist
no

wiped

and
this

has
cost
france
only
the
trifle
of
millions
divided
amongst
twelve

forty
thousand

verily
this

these

no

is
it
that

hears
amid

hangs
like

ayes
let
us
say
a
word
of
them
ii
the
diligence
a
brigand
stops
a
diligence
in
the
woods
he
is
at
the
head
of
a
resolute
band
the
travellers
are
more
numerous
but
they
are
separated
disunited
cooped
up
in
the
different
compartments
half
asleep
surprised
in
the
middle
of
the
night
seized
unexpectedly
and
without
arms
the
brigand
orders
them
to
alight
not
to
utter
a
cry
not
to
speak
a
word
and
to
lie
down
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
some
resist
he
blows
out
their
brains
the
rest
obey
and
lie
on
the
road
speechless
motionless
terrified
mixed
up
with
the
dead
bodies
and
half
dead
themselves
the
brigand
while
his
accomplices
keep
their
feet
on
the
ribs
of
the
travellers
and
their
pistols
at
their
heads
rifles
their
pockets
forces
open
their
trunks
and
takes
all
the
valuables
they
possess
the
pockets
rifled
the
trunks
pillaged
the
completed
he
says
to
them
now
in
order
to
set
myself
right
with
justice
i
have
written
down
on
paper
a
declaration
that
you
acknowledge
that
all
i
have
taken
belonged
to
me
and
that
you
give
it
to
me
of
your
own
free
will
i
propose
that
this
shall
be
your
view
of
the
matter
each
of
you
will
have
a
pen
given
you
and
without
uttering
a
syllable
without
making
the
slightest
movement
without
quitting
your
present
attitude
belly
on
ground
and
face
in
the
mud
you
will
put
out
your
arms
and
you
will
all
sign
this
paper
if
any
one
of
you
moves
or
speaks
here
is
the
muzzle
of
my
pistol
otherwise
you
are
quite
free
the
travellers
put
out
their
arms
and
sign
the
brigand
thereupon
tosses
his
head
and
says
i
have
seven
million
five
hundred

iii
scrutiny
of
the
a
reminder
of
facts
louis
bonaparte
is
president
of
this
diligence
let
us
recall
a
few
principles
for
a
political
ballot
to
be
valid
three
absolute
conditions
must
exist
first
the
vote
must
be
free
second
the
vote
must
be
intelligent
third
the
figures
must
be
accurate
if
one
of
these
three
conditions
is
wanting
the
ballot
is
null
how
is
it
when
all
three
are
wanting
let
us
apply
these
rules
first
the
vote
must
be
what
freedom
there
was
in
the
vote
of
the
of
december
we
have
just
pointed
out
we
have
described
that
freedom
by
a
striking
display
of
evidence
we
might
dispense
with
adding
anything
to
it
let
each
of
those
who
voted
reflect
and
ask
himself
under
what
moral
and
physical
violence
he
dropped
his
ballot
in
the
box
we
might
cite
a
certain
commune
of
the
yonne
where
of
five
hundred
heads
of
families
four
hundred
and
thirty
were
arrested
and
the
rest
voted
aye
or
a
commune
of
the
loiret
where
of
six
hundred
and
heads
of
families
four
hundred
and
were
arrested
or
banished
the
one
hundred
and
who
escaped
voted
aye
what
we
say
of
the
loiret
and
the
yonne
might
be
said
of
all
the
departments
since
the
of
december
each
town
has
its
swarm
of
spies
each
village
each
hamlet
its
informer
to
vote
no
was
imprisonment
transportation
lambessa
in
the
villages
of
one
department
we
were
told
by
an
they
brought
of
ballots
the
mayors
flanked
by
distributed
them
among
the
peasants
they
had
no
choice
but
to
vote
at
savigny
near
on
the
morning
of
the
vote
some
enthusiastic
gendarmes
declared
that
the
man
who
voted
no
should
not
sleep
in
his
bed
the
gendarmerie
cast
into
the
house
of
detention
at
valenciennes
parent
the
younger
deputy
justice
of
the
peace
of
the
canton
of
bouchain
for
having
advised
certain
inhabitants
of
to
vote
no
the
nephew
of
representative
aubry
du
nord
having
seen
the
agents
of
the
prefect
distribute
aye
ballots
in
the
great
square
of
lille
went
into
the
square
next
morning
and
distributed
no
ballots
he
was
arrested
and
confined
in
the
citadel
as
to
the
vote
of
the
army
a
part
of
it
voted
in
its
own
cause
the
rest
followed
but
even
as
to
the
freedom
of
this
vote
of
the
soldiers
let
us
hear
the
army
speak
for
itself
this
is
what
is
written
by
a
soldier
of
the
regiment
of
the
line
commanded
by
colonel
garderens
de
boisse
so
far
as
our
company
was
concerned
the
vote
was
a
the
subaltern
officers
the
corporals
the
drummers
and
the
soldiers
arranged
in
order
of
rank
were
named
by
the
quartermaster
in
presence
of
the
colonel
the
the
major
and
the
company
officers
and
as
each
man
named
answered
his
name
was
inscribed
by
the
the
colonel
rubbing
his
hands
was
saying
gentlemen
this
is
going
on
wheels
when
a
corporal
of
the
company
to
which
i
belong
approached
the
table
at
which
the
was
seated
and
requested
him
to
let
him
have
the
pen
that
he
might
himself
inscribe
his
name
on
the
register
which
was
intended
to
remain
blank
cried
the
colonel
who
are
down
for
quartermaster
and
who
are
to
be
appointed
on
the
first
vacancy
you
formally
disobey
your
colonel
and
that
in
the
presence
of
your
company
it
would
be
bad
enough
if
this
refusal
of
yours
were
simply
an
act
of
insubordination
but
know
you
not
wretched
man
that
by
your
vote
you
seek
to
bring
about
the
destruction
of
the
army
the
burning
of
your
father
house
the
annihilation
of
all
society
you
hold
out
your
hand
to
debauchery
what
x
you
whom
i
intended
to
urge
for
promotion
you
come
here
and
admit
all
this
the
poor
devil
it
may
be
imagined
allowed
his
name
to
be
inscribed
with
the
rest
multiply
this
colonel
by
six
hundred
thousand
and
the
product
is
the
pressure
of
the
functionaries
of
all
sorts
military
political
civil
administrative
ecclesiastical
judicial
fiscal
municipal
scholastic
commercial
and
consular
throughout
france
on
the
soldier
the
citizen
and
the
peasant
add
as
we
have
above
pointed
out
the
fictitious
communist
jacquerie
and
the
real
bonapartist
terrorism
the
government
imposing
by
phantasmagoria
on
the
weak
and
by
dictatorship
on
the
refractory
and
brandishing
two
terrors
together
it
would
require
a
special
volume
to
relate
expose
and
develop
the
innumerable
details
of
that
immense
extortion
of
signatures
which
is
called
the
vote
of
the
of
december
the
vote
of
the
of
december
prostrated
the
honour
the
initiative
the
intelligence
and
the
moral
life
of
the
nation
france
went
to
that
vote
as
sheep
go
to
the
let
us
proceed
second
the
vote
must
be
here
is
an
elementary
proposition
where
there
is
no
liberty
of
the
press
there
is
no
vote
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
the
condition
qu√¢
of
universal
suffrage
every
ballot
cast
in
the
absence
of
liberty
of
the
press
is
void
liberty
of
the
press
involves
as
necessary
corollaries
liberty
of
meeting
liberty
of
publishing
liberty
of
distributing
information
all
the
liberties
engendered
by
the
right
antedating
all
other
rights
of
informing
one
self
before
voting
to
vote
is
to
steer
to
vote
is
to
judge
can
one
imagine
a
blind
pilot
at
the
helm
can
one
imagine
a
judge
with
his
ears
stuffed
and
his
eyes
put
out
liberty
then
liberty
to
inform
one
self
by
every
means
by
inquiry
by
the
press
by
speech
by
discussion
this
is
the
express
guarantee
the
condition
of
being
of
universal
suffrage
in
order
that
a
thing
may
be
done
validly
it
must
be
done
knowingly
where
there
is
no
torch
there
is
no
binding
act
these
are
axioms
outside
of
these
axioms
all
is
null
now
let
us
see
did
bonaparte
in
his
ballot
of
the
of
december
obey
these
axioms
did
he
fulfil
the
conditions
of
free
press
free
meetings
free
tribune
free
advertising
free
inquiry
the
answer
is
an
immense
shout
of
laughter
even
from
the
√©lys√©e
thus
you
are
yourself
compelled
to
admit
that
it
was
thus
that
universal
suffrage
was
exercised
what
i
know
nothing
of
what
is
going
on
men
have
been
killed
slaughtered
murdered
massacred
and
i
am
ignorant
of
it
men
have
been
arbitrarily
imprisoned
tortured
banished
exiled
transported
and
i
scarcely
glimpse
the
fact
my
mayor
and
my
cur√©
tell
me
these
people
who
are
taken
away
bound
with
cords
are
escaped
convicts
i
am
a
peasant
cultivating
a
patch
of
land
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
provinces
you
suppress
the
newspaper
you
stifle
information
you
prevent
the
truth
from
reaching
me
and
then
you
make
me
vote
in
the
uttermost
darkness
of
night
gropingly
what
you
rush
out
upon
me
from
the
obscurity
sabre
in
hand
and
you
say
to
me
vote
and
you
call
that
a
ballot
certainly
a
and
spontaneous
ballot
say
the
organs
of
the
every
sort
of
machinery
was
set
to
work
at
this
vote
one
village
mayor
a
species
of
wild
escobar
growing
in
the
fields
said
to
his
peasants
if
you
vote
is
for
the
republic
if
you
vote
against
the
republic
the
peasants
voted
aye
and
let
us
illuminate
another
aspect
of
this
turpitude
that
people
call
the
plebiscite
of
the
of
december
how
was
the
question
put
was
any
choice
possible
did
he
and
it
was
the
least
that
a
man
should
have
done
in
so
strange
a
ballot
as
that
wherein
he
put
everything
at
stake
did
he
open
to
each
party
the
door
at
which
its
principles
could
enter
were
the
legitimists
allowed
to
turn
towards
their
exiled
prince
and
towards
the
ancient
honour
of
the
were
the
orleanists
allowed
to
turn
towards
that
proscribed
family
honoured
by
the
valued
services
of
two
soldiers
m
de
joinville
and
and
made
illustrious
by
that
exalted
soul
madame
la
duchesse
did
he
offer
to
the
people
who
are
not
a
party
but
the
people
that
is
to
say
the
sovereign
did
he
offer
to
the
people
that
true
republic
before
which
all
monarchy
vanishes
as
night
before
day
that
republic
which
is
the
manifest
and
irresistible
future
of
the
civilized
world
the
republic
without
dictatorship
the
republic
of
concord
of
learning
and
of
liberty
the
republic
of
universal
suffrage
of
universal
peace
and
of
universal
the
republic
initiator
of
peoples
and
liberator
of
nationalities
that
republic
which
after
all
and
whatever
any
one
may
do
will
as
the
author
of
this
book
has
said
elsewhere
possess
france
and
europe
the
day
after
did
he
offer
that
no
this
is
how
bonaparte
put
the
matter
there
were
in
this
ballot
two
candidates
first
candidate
bonaparte
second
candidate
the
abyss
france
had
the
choice
admire
the
adroitness
of
the
man
and
not
a
little
his
humility
bonaparte
took
for
his
opponent
in
this
contest
whom
de
chambord
no
de
joinville
no
the
republic
still
less
bonaparte
like
those
pretty
creoles
who
show
off
their
beauty
by
juxtaposition
with
some
frightful
hottentot
took
as
his
competitor
in
this
election
a
phantom
a
vision
a
socialistic
monster
of
nuremberg
with
long
teeth
and
talons
and
a
live
coal
in
its
eyes
the
ogre
of
tom
thumb
the
vampire
of
porte
the
hydra
of
theramenes
the
great
of
the
which
the
shareholders
have
had
the
kindness
to
impute
to
it
the
dragon
of
the
apocalypse
the
tarask
the
dr√©e
the
a
scarecrow
aided
by
a
ruggieri
of
his
own
bonaparte
lit
up
this
pasteboard
monster
with
red
bengal
fire
and
said
to
the
scared
voter
there
is
no
possible
choice
except
this
or
myself
choose
he
said
choose
between
beauty
and
the
beast
the
beast
is
communism
the
beauty
is
my
dictatorship
choose
there
is
no
medium
society
prostrate
your
house
burned
your
barn
pillaged
your
cow
stolen
your
fields
confiscated
your
wife
outraged
your
children
murdered
your
wine
drunk
by
others
yourself
devoured
alive
by
the
great
yonder
or
me
as
your
emperor
choose
me
or
et

m√™l√©es
the
citizen
affrighted
and
consequently
a
child
the
peasant
ignorant
and
consequently
a
child
preferred
bonaparte
to
such
is
his
triumph
observe
however
that
of
ten
millions
of
voters
five
hundred
thousand
would
it
seems
have
preferred
after
all
bonaparte
only
had
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
votes
thus
then
and
in
this
fashion
freely
as
we
see
knowingly
as
we
see
that
which
bonaparte
is
good
enough
to
call
universal
suffrage
voted
voted
what
dictatorship
autocracy
slavery
the
republic
a
despotism
france
a
pachalik
chains
on
all
wrists
a
seal
on
every
mouth
silence
degradation
fear
the
spy
the
soul
of
all
things
they
have
given
to
a
man
to
you
omnipotence
and
omniscience
they
have
made
that
man
the
supreme
the
only
legislator
the
alpha
of
the
law
the
omega
of
power
they
have
decreed
that
he
is
minos
that
he
is
numa
that
he
is
solon
that
he
is
lycurgus
they
have
incarnated
in
him
the
people
the
nation
the
state
the
law
and
for
ten
years
what
i
a
citizen
vote
not
only
for
my
own
dispossession
my
own
forfeiture
my
own
abdication
but
for
the
abdication
of
universal
suffrage
for
ten
years
by
the
coming
generations
over
whom
i
have
no
right
over
whom
you
an
usurper
force
me
to
usurp
power
which
by
the
way
be
it
said
in
passing
would
suffice
to
nullify
that
monstrous
ballot
if
all
conceivable
nullities
were
not
already
piled
heaped
and
welded
upon
it
what
is
that
what
you
would
have
me
do
you
make
me
vote
that
all
is
finished
that
nothing
remains
that
the
people
is
a
slave
what
you
say
to
me
since
you
are
sovereign
you
shall
give
yourself
a
master
since
you
are
france
you
shall
become
haiti
what
an
abominable
farce
such
is
the
vote
of
the
of
december
that
sanction
as
de
morny
says
that
absolution
as
bonaparte
says
assuredly
a
short
time
hence
in
a
year
in
a
month
perhaps
in
a
week
when
all
that
we
now
see
has
vanished
men
will
be
ashamed
of
having
if
only
for
an
instant
bestowed
upon
that
infamous
semblance
of
a
ballot
which
they
call
the
ballot
of
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
votes
the
honour
of
discussing
it
yet
it
is
the
only
basis
the
only
support
the
only
rampart
of
this
prodigious
power
of
bonaparte
this
vote
is
the
excuse
of
cowards
this
vote
is
the
buckler
of
dishonoured
consciences
generals
magistrates
bishops
all
crimes
all
prevarications
all
degrees
of
complicity
seek
refuge
for
their
ignominy
behind
this
vote
france
has
spoken
say
they
populi
vox
universal
suffrage
has
voted
everything
is
covered
by
a
a
vote
a
ballot
one
spits
on
it
and
passes
by
third
figures
must
be
i
admire
that
figure
it
must
have
had
a
fine
effect
through
the
fog
of
the
of
january
in
letters
of
gold
three
feet
high
on
the
portal
of

admire
that
figure
do
you
know
why
because
i
consider
it
humble
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
why
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
it
is
not
many
no
one
refused
bonaparte
full
measure
after
what
he
had
done
on
the
of
december
he
was
entitled
to
something
better
than
that
tell
us
who
played
him
that
trick
who
prevented
him
from
putting
down
eight
millions
or
ten
millions
a
good
round
sum
as
for
myself
i
was
quite
disappointed
in
my
hopes
i
counted
on
unanimity
you
are
indeed
modest
how
now
a
man
has
done
all
we
have
recalled
or
related
has
taken
an
oath
and
perjured
himself
was
the
guardian
of
a
constitution
and
destroyed
it
was
the
servant
of
a
republic
and
betrayed
it
was
the
agent
of
a
sovereign
assembly
and
violently
crushed
it
used
the
military
as
a
poignard
to
kill

used
the

made
the

mazas
vincennes

with
inviolable
men
shot
down
on
the
barricade
of
the

the
legislator
girt
with
that
scarf
which
is
the
sacred
and
venerable
symbol
of
the

gave
to
a
colonel
whom
we
could
name
a
hundred
thousand

to
trample

under

ten

you
satisfied
he
obtains
only
seven

really
he
is
underpaid

come
be
frank
and
confess
that
you
are
more
or
less
swindlers
that
you
cheat
a
little
in
your
of
the
of

you
set
down
too
many
votes
and
not
enough
corpses
seven

figure
is
that
whence
comes
it
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
it
seven

eight

ten
million
what
does
it
matter
we
concede
you
everything
and
we
contest
everything
with
you
the
seven
million
you
have
plus
the
five
hundred

the
round
sum
plus
the
odd
money
you

we

simply
this
that

off

however
do
we
mean
to
declare
that
nobody
really
voted
for
bonaparte
that
no
one
voluntarily
said
aye
that
no
one
knowingly
and
willingly
accepted
that

by
no

bonaparte
had
for
him
the

of
officeholders
the

two
hundred

parasites
of
the
budget
and
their
dependents
and
the

bonaparte

all

all
those

the

this

that
you

yes
would
you
engage

this
is

the

that
they
may

once
this
is

this
is
the
plebiscite
this
is
the
vote
this
is
the
sovereign
decree
of
universal
suffrage
beneath
whose
shadow
take
shelter
of
which
they
make
a
patent
of

a

up

their

in

up
to

and
now
to
have
done
with
it
let
us
make
a
concession
to
bonaparte
no
more
quibbling
his
ballot
of
the
of
december
was
free
it
was
intelligent
all
the
newspapers
printed
whatever
they
pleased
he
who
says
the
contrary
is
a
slanderer
electoral
meetings
were
held
the
walls
were
hidden
beneath
placards
the
promenaders
in
paris
swept
with
their
feet
on
the
boulevards
and
on
the
streets
a
snow
of
ballots
white
blue
yellow
red
everybody
spoke
who
chose
wrote
who
chose
the
figures
were
accurate
it
was
not
baroche
who
counted
it
was
bar√™me
louis
blanc
guinard
f√©lix
pyat
raspail
caussidi√®re
thorn√©
etienne
arago
albert
barb√®s
blanqui
and
gent
were
the
inspectors
it
was
they
themselves
who
announced
the
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
votes
be
it
so
we
concede
all
that
what
then
what
conclusion
does
the
thence
derive
what
conclusion
it
rubs
its
hands
it
asks
nothing
further
that
is
quite
sufficient
it
concludes
that
all
is
right
all
complete
all
finished
that
nothing
more
is
to
be
said
that
it
is
absolved
stop
there
the
free
vote
the
actual
figures
these
are
only
the
physical
side
of
the
question
the
moral
side
remains
to
be
considered
ah
there
is
a
moral
side
then
undoubtedly
prince
and
that
is
precisely
the
true
side
the
important
side
of
this
question
of
the
of
december
let
us
look
into
it
vi
the
moral
side
of
the
question
first
bonaparte
it
is
expedient
that
you
should
acquire
a
notion
what
the
human
conscience
is
there
are
two
things
in
this
world
learn
this
novelty
which
men
call
good
and
evil
you
must
be
informed
that
lying
is
not
good
treachery
is
evil
assassination
is
worse
it
makes
no
difference
that
it
is
useful
it
is
prohibited
by
whom
you
will
add
we
will
explain
that
point
to
you
a
little
farther
on
but
let
us
proceed
man
you
must
also
be
informed
is
a
thinking
being
free
in
this
world
responsible
in
the
next
singularly
enough
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
it
he
is
not
created
merely
to
enjoy
himself
to
indulge
all
his
fancies
to
follow
the
hazard
of
his
appetites
to
crush
whatever
he
finds
before
him
in
his
path
blade
of
grass
or
plighted
oath
to
devour
whatever
presents
itself
when
he
is
hungry
life
is
not
his
prey
for
example
to
pass
from
nothing
a
year
to
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
it
is
not
permitted
to
take
an
oath
which
one
has
no
intention
to
keep
and
to
pass
from
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
to
twelve
millions
it
is
not

continue
your
initiation
into
this
singular
mystery
certes
it
is
agreeable
to
give
one
lackeys
white

but
to
arrive
at
this
grand
result
it
is
not

to
suppress
the

the

of
a
people
to
overthrow
the
central
tribune
of
the
civilized
world
to
shackle
the
progress
of
mankind
and
to
shed
torrents
of
blood
that
is
forbidden
by
whom
you
repeat
who
see
before
you
no
one
who
forbids
you
anything
patience
you
shall
know
presently
what
here
you
begin
to
be
disgusted
and
i
can
understand
it
when
one
has
on
the
one
hand
one
interest
one
ambition
fortune
one
pleasures
a
fine
palace
to
maintain
in
faubourg
and
on
the
other
side
the
jeremiads
and
whining
of
women
from
whom
one
takes
their
sons
of
families
from
whom
one
tears
their
fathers
of
children
from
whom
one
takes
their
bread
of
the
people
whose
liberty
one
confiscates
of
society
from
whom
one
takes
its
support
the

what
when
these
clamours
are
on
one
side
and
one
own
interest
on
the
other
is
it
not
permitted
to
contemn
the
uproar
to
let
all
these
people
vociferate
unheeded
to
trample
on
all
obstacles
and
to
go
naturally
where
one
sees
one
fortune
pleasures
and
the
fine
palace
in
faubourg
a
pretty
idea
truly
what
one
is
to
trouble
one
self
to
remember
that
some
three
or
four
years
ago
one
can
not
now
say
when
or
where
one
day
in
december
when
it
was
very
cold
and
rained
and
one
felt
it
desirable
to
leave
a
chamber
in
an
inn
for
a
better
lodging
one
pronounced
one
no
longer
knows
in
relation
to
what
in
an
indifferently
lighted
room
before
eight
or
nine
hundred
imbeciles
who
chose
to
believe
what
one
said
these
eight
letters
i
swear
it
what
when
one
is
meditating
a
great
act
one
must
needs
waste
one
time
asking
one
self
what
will
be
the
result
of
the
course
that
he
is
taking
must
worry
because
one
man
may
be
eaten
up
by
vermin
in
the
casemates
or
another
rot
in
the
hulks
or
another
die
at
cayenne
or
because
another
was
killed
with
bayonets
or
another
crushed
by
or
another
idiot
enough
to
get
himself
shot
because
these
are
ruined
and
those
exiled
and
because
all
these
men
whom
one
ruins
or
shoots
or
exiles
or
massacres
who
rot
in
the
hulks
or
die
in
the
hold
or
in
africa
are
forsooth
honest
men
who
have
done
their
duty
is
one
to
be
stopped
by
such
stuff
as
that
what
one
has
necessities
one
has
no
money
one
is
a
prince
chance
places
power
in
one
hands
one
makes
use
of
it
one
authorizes
lotteries
one
exhibits
ingots
of
gold
in
the
passage
jouffroy
everybody
opens
his
pocket
one
takes
all
one
can
out
of
it
one
shares
what
one
gets
with
one
friends
with
the
devoted
comrades
to
whom
one
owes
gratitude
and
because
there
comes
a
moment
when
public
indiscretion
meddles
in
the
matter
when
that
infamous
liberty
of
the
press
seeks
to
fathom
the
mystery
and
justice
fancies
that
it
is
its
business
one
must
needs
leave
the
√©ys√©e
lay
down
the
power
and
take
one
seat
like
an
ass
between
two
gendarmes
on
the
prisoners
bench
in
the
sixth
chamber
nonsense
is
it
much
more
simple
to
take
one
seat
on
the
throne
of
the
emperor
is
it
much
more
simple
to
destroy
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
it
much
more
simple
to
crush
justice
is
it
a
much
shorter
way
to
trample
the
judges
under
foot
indeed
they
ask
nothing
better
they
are
quite
ready
and
this
is
not
permitted
this
is
forbidden
yes
monseigneur
this
is
forbidden
who
opposes
it
who
does
not
permit

who
forbids
it
monsieur
bonaparte
you
are
master
you
have
eight
millions
of
votes
for
your
crimes
and
twelve
millions
of
francs
for
your
pleasures
you
have
a
senate
with
sibour
in
it
you
have
armies
cannon
fortresses
troplongs
flat
on
their
bellies
and
baroches
on
all
fours
you
are
a
despot
you
are
some
one
lost
in
the
obscurity
unknown
a
mere
rises
before
you
and
says
to
you
thou
shalt
not
do
this
this
some
one
this
voice
that
speaks
in
the
darkness
not
seen
but
heard
this
this
unknown
this
insolent
intruder
is
the
human
conscience
that
is
what
the
human
conscience
is
it
is
some
one
i
repeat
whom
one
sees
not
and
who
is
stronger
than
an
army
more
numerous
than
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
votes
more
lofty
than
a
senate
more
religious
than
an
archbishop
more
learned
in
law
than
troplong
more
prompt
to
anticipate
any
sort
of
justice
than
baroche
and
who
your
majesty
vii
an
explanation
for
bonaparte
benefit
let
us
go
a
little
deeper
into
all
these
novelties
pray
learn
this
also
bonaparte
that
which
distinguishes
man
from
brute
is
the
notion
of
good
and
of
evil
of
that
good
and
that
evil
of
which
i
was
speaking
to
you
just
now
there
is
the
abyss
the
animal
is
a
complete
being
that
which
constitutes
the
grandeur
of
man
is
the
being
incomplete
it
is
the
feeling
one
self
to
be
many
degrees
removed
from
completion
it
is
the
perceiving
something
on
that
side
of
one
self
something
on
this
side
this
something
is
mystery
it
is
to
make
use
of
those
feeble
human
expressions
which
always
come
one
by
one
and
never
express
more
than
one
side
of
things
the
moral
world
this
moral
world
man
bathes
in
as
much
as
more
than
in
the
material
world
he
lives
in
what
he
feels
more
than
in
what
he
sees
creation
may
beset
him
want
may
assail
him
pleasure
may
tempt
him
the
beast
within
him
may
torment
him
but
all
in
vain
a
sort
of
incessant
aspiration
toward
another
world
impels
him
irresistibly
beyond
creation
beyond
want
beyond
pleasure
beyond
the
beast
he
glimpses
everywhere
at
every
moment
the
upper
world
and
he
fills
his
soul
with
that
vision
and
regulates
his
actions
by
it
he
does
not
feel
complete
in
this
life
on
earth
he
bears
within
him
so
to
speak
a
mysterious
pattern
of
the
anterior
and
ulterior
world
the
perfect
world
with
which
he
is
incessantly
and
despite
himself
comparing
the
imperfect
world
and
himself
and
his
infirmities
and
his
appetites
and
his
passions
and
his
actions
when
he
perceives
that
he
is
approaching
this
ideal
pattern
he
is
overjoyed
when
he
sees
that
he
is
receding
from
it
he
is
sad
he
understands
thoroughly
that
there
is
nothing
useless
or
superfluous
in
this
world
nothing
which
does
not
proceed
from
something
and
which
does
not
lead
to
something
the
just
the
unjust
good
evil
good
works
evil
deeds
fall
into
the
abyss
but
are
not
lost
there
passing
on
into
the
infinite
for
the
benefit
or
the
burden
of
those
who
have
accomplished
them
after
death
they
are
collected
and
the
cast
up
to
disappear
to
vanish
to
be
annihilated
to
cease
to
be
is
no
more
possible
for
the
moral
atom
than
for
the
material
atom
hence
in
man
that
great
twofold
sense
of
his
liberty
and
of
his
responsibility
it
is
given
him
to
be
good
or
to
be
bad
it
is
an
account
that
will
have
to
be
settled
he
may
be
guilty
and
therein
a
striking
circumstance
upon
which
i
dwell
consists
his
grandeur
there
is
nothing
similar
for
the
brute
with
the
brute
it
is
all
instinct
to
drink
when
thirsty
to
eat
when
hungry
to
procreate
in
due
season
to
sleep
when
the
sun
sets
to
wake
when
it
rises
or
if
it
be
a
beast
of
night
the
brute
has
only
an
obscure
sort
of
illumined
by
no
moral
light
its
entire
law
i
repeat
is
instinct
instinct
a
sort
of
railway
along
which
inevitable
nature
impels
the
brute
no
liberty
therefore
no
responsibility
and
consequently
no
future
life
the
brute
does
neither
evil
nor
good
it
is
wholly
ignorant
even
the
tiger
is
innocent
if
perchance
you
were
innocent
as
the
tiger
at
certain
moments
one
is
tempted
to
believe
that
having
no
warning
voice
within
any
more
than
the
tiger
you
have
no
more
sense
of
responsibility
really
at
times
i
pity
you
who
knows
perhaps
after
all
you
are
only
a
miserable
blind
force
louis
bonaparte
you
have
not
the
notion
of
good
and
evil
you
are
perhaps
the
only
man
of
all
mankind
who
has
not
that
notion
this
gives
you
a
start
over
the
human
race
yes
you
are
formidable
it
is
that
which
constitutes
your
genius
it
is
said
i
admit
that
at
all
events
it
is
that
which
at
this
moment
constitutes
your
power
but
do
you
know
what
results
from
this
sort
of
power
possession
yes
right
no
crime
essays
to
deceive
history
as
to
its
true
name
it
says
i
am
success
thou
art
crime
you
are
crowned
and
masked
down
with
the
mask
down
with
the
crown
ah
you
are
wasting
your
trouble
you
are
wasting
your
appeals
to
the
people
your
plebiscites
your
ballots
your
footings
your
executive
committees
proclaiming
the
sum
total
your
red
or
green
banners
with
these
figures
in
gold
paper
you
will
derive
no
advantage
from
this
elaborate
there
are
things
about
which
universal
sentiment
is
not
to
be
gulled
the
human
race
taken
as
a
whole
is
an
honest
man
even
by
those
about
you
you
are
judged
there
is
not
one
of
your
domestics
whether
in
gold
lace
or
in
embroidered
coat
valet
of
the
stable
or
valet
of
the
senate
who
does
not
say
beneath
his
breath
that
which
i
say
aloud
what
i
proclaim
they
whisper
that
is
the
only
difference
you
are
omnipotent
they
bend
the
knee
that
is
all
they
salute
you
their
brows
burning
with
shame
they
feel
that
they
are
base
but
they
know
that
you
are
infamous
come
since
you
are
by
way
of
hunting
those
whom
you
call
the
rebels
of
december
since
it
is
on
them
you
are
setting
your
hounds
since
you
have
instituted
a
maupas
and
created
a
ministry
of
police
specially
for
that
purpose
i
denounce
to
you
that
rebel
that
recusant
that
insurgent
every
man
conscience
you
give
money
but
is
the
hand
receives
it
not
the
conscience
conscience
while
you
are
about
it
inscribe
it
on
your
lists
of
exiles
it
is
an
obstinate
opponent
pertinacious
persistent
inflexible
making
a
disturbance
everywhere
drive
it
out
of
france
you
will
be
at
ease
then
would
you
like
to
know
what
it
calls
you
even
among
your
friends
would
you
like
to
know
in
what
terms
an
honourable
chevalier
of
an
octogenarian
a
great
antagonist
of
demagogues
and
a
partisan
of
yours
cast
his
vote
for
you
on
the
of
december
he
is
a
scoundrel
said
he
but
a
no
there
are
no
necessary
scoundrels
no
crime
is
never
useful
no
crime
is
never
a
good
society
saved
by
treason
blasphemy
we
must
leave
it
to
the
archbishops
to
say
these
things
nothing
good
has
evil
for
its
basis
the
just
god
does
not
impose
on
mankind
the
necessity
for
scoundrels
there
is
nothing
necessary
in
this
world
but
justice
and
truth
had
that
venerable
man
thought
less
of
life
and
more
of
the
tomb
he
would
have
seen
this
such
a
remark
is
surprising
on
the
part
of
one
advanced
in
years
for
there
is
a
light
from
god
which
enlightens
souls
approaching
the
tomb
and
shows
them
the
truth
never
do
crime
and
the
right
come
together
on
the
day
when
they
should
meet
the
words
of
the
human
tongue
would
change
their
meaning
all
certainty
would
vanish
social
darkness
would
supervene
when
by
chance
as
has
been
sometimes
seen
in
history
it
happens
that
for
a
moment
crime
has
the
force
of
law
the
very
foundations
of
humanity
tremble
datum
sceleri
exclaims
lucan
and
that
line
traverses
history
like
a
cry
of
horror
therefore
and
by
the
admission
of
your
voters
you
are
a
scoundrel
i
omit
the
word
necessary
make
the
best
of
this
situation
well
be
it
so
you
say
but
that
is
precisely
the
case
in
question
one
procures
by
universal
suffrage
impossible
what
impossible
yes
impossible
i
will
put
your
finger
on
the
impossibility
viii
axioms
you
are
a
captain
of
artillery
at
berne
monsieur
louis
bonaparte
you
have
necessarily
a
smattering
of
algebra
and
geometry
here
are
certain
axioms
of
which
you
have
probably
some
idea
two
and
two
make
four
between
two
given
points
the
straight
line
is
the
shortest
way
a
part
is
less
than
the
whole
now
cause
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
voters
to
declare
that
two
and
two
make
five
that
the
straight
line
is
the
longest
way
that
the
whole
is
less
than
a
part
cause
eight
millions
ten
millions
a
hundred
millions
of
voters
so
to
declare
and
you
will
not
have
advanced
a
single
step
well
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
it
there
are
axioms
in
probity
in
honesty
in
justice
as
there
are
axioms
in
geometry
and
moral
truth
is
no
more
at
the
mercy
of
a
vote
than
is
algebraic
truth
the
notion
of
good
and
evil
is
insoluble
by
universal
suffrage
it
is
not
given
to
a
ballot
to
make
the
false
true
or
injustice
just
human
conscience
is
not
to
be
put
to
the
vote
now
do
you
understand
look
at
that
lamp
that
little
obscure
light
unnoticed
forgotten
in
a
corner
lost
in
the
darkness
look
at
it
admire
it
it
is
hardly
visible
it
burns
in
solitude
make
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
mouths
breathe
upon
it
at
once
and
you
will
not
extinguish
it
you
will
not
even
cause
the
flame
to
flicker
cause
a
hurricane
to
blow
the
flame
will
continue
to
ascend
straight
and
pure
towards
heaven
that
lamp
is
conscience
that
flame
is
the
flame
which
illumines
in
the
night
of
exile
the
paper
on
which
i
now
write
ix
wherein
bonaparte
has
deceived
himself
thus
then
be
your
figures
what
they
may
counterfeit
or
genuine
true
or
false
extorted
or
not
it
matters
little
they
who
keep
their
eyes
steadfastly
on
justice
say
and
will
continue
to
say
that
crime
is
crime
that
perjury
is
perjury
that
treachery
is
treachery
that
murder
is
murder
that
blood
is
blood
that
slime
is
slime
that
a
scoundrel
is
a
scoundrel
that
the
man
who
fancies
he
is
copying
napoleon
is
copying
lacenaire
they
say
that
and
they
will
repeat
it
despite
your
figures
seeing
that
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
votes
weigh
as
nothing
against
the
conscience
of
the
honest
man
seeing
that
ten
millions
that
a
hundred
millions
of
votes
that
even
the
whole
of
mankind
voting
would
count
as
nothing
against
that
atom
that
molecule
of
god
the
soul
of
the
just
man
seeing
that
universal
suffrage
which
has
full
sovereignty
over
political
questions
has
no
jurisdiction
over
moral
questions
i
put
aside
for
the
moment
as
i
said
just
now
your
process
of
ballotting
with
eyes
bandaged
gag
in
mouth
cannon
in
the
streets
and
squares
sabres
drawn
spies
swarming
silence
and
terror
leading
the
voter
to
the
as
a
malefactor
to
the
prison
i
put
these
aside
i
assume
i
repeat
genuine
universal
suffrage
free
pure
real
universal
suffrage
controlling
itself
as
it
ought
to
do
newspapers
in
everybody
hands
men
and

and

placards
covering

all
the
problems
the
solution
of
which
does
not
involve
its
own
abdication
for
universal
suffrage
may
do
everything
except
abdicate
submit
these
things
to
it
and
it
will
solve
them
not
without
error
perhaps
but
with
the
grand
total
of
certitude
that
appertains
to
human
sovereignty
it
will
solve
them
masterfully
now
put
to
it
the
question
whether
john
or
peter
did
well
or
ill
in
stealing
an
apple
from
an
orchard
at
that
it
halts
it
is
at
fault
why
is
it
because
this
question
is
on
a
lower
plane
no
it
is
because
it
is
on
a
higher
plane
all
that
constitutes
the
proper
organization
of
societies
whether
you
consider
them
as
territory
commune
state
as
country
every
political
financial
social
matter
depends
on
universal
suffrage
and
obeys
it
the
smallest
atom
of
the
smallest
moral
question
defies
it
the
ship
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
ocean
the
star
is
not
it
has
been
said
of
leverrier
and
of
yourself
monsieur
bonaparte
that
you
were
the
only
two
men
who
believed
in
your
star
you
do
in
fact
believe
in
your
star
you
look
for
it
above
your
head
well
that
star
which
you
seek
outside
of
yourself
other
men
have
within
themselves
it
shines
beneath
the
vaulted
roof
of
their
brain
it
enlightens
and
guides
them
it
shows
them
the
true
outlines
of
life
it
exhibits
to
them
in
the
obscurity
of
human
destiny
good
and
evil
the
just
and
the
unjust
the
real
and
the
false
ignominy
and
honour
honesty
and
knavery
virtue
and
crime
this
star
without
which
the
human
soul
is
but
darkness
is
moral
truth
wanting
this
light
you
have
deceived
yourself
your
ballot
of
the
of
december
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
thinker
merely
a
sort
of
monstrous
simplicity
you
have
applied
what
you
call
universal
suffrage
to
a
question
to
which
universal
suffrage
did
not
apply
you
are
not
a
politician
you
are
a
malefactor
the
question
what
is
to
be
done
with
you
is
no
concern
of
universal
suffrage
yes
simplicity
i
insist
on
the
term
the
bandit
of
the
abruzzi
his
hands
scarcely
laved
of
the
blood
which
still
remains
under
his
nails
goes
to
seek
absolution
from
the
priest
you
have
sought
absolution
from
the
ballot
only
you
have
forgotten
to
confess
and
in
saying
to
the
ballot
absolve
me
you
put
the
muzzle
of
your
pistol
to
its
forehead
ah
wretched
desperate
man
to
absolve
you
as
you
call
it
is
beyond
the
popular
power
is
beyond
all
human
power
listen
nero
who
had
invented
the
society
of
the
and
who
like
yourself
employed
it
in
applauding
his
comedies
and
even
like
you
again
his
tragedies
nero
after
he
had
slashed
his
belly
a
hundred
times
with
a
dagger
might
like
you
have
appealed
to
his
universal
suffrage
which
had
this
further
resemblance
to
yours
that
it
was
no
more
impeded
by
the
license
of
the
press
nero
pontiff
and
emperor
surrounded
by
judges
and
priests
prostrate
at
his
feet
might
have
placed
one
of
his
bleeding
hands
on
the
still
warm
corpse
of
the
empress
and
raising
the
other
towards
heaven
have
called
all
olympus
to
witness
that
he
had
not
shed
that
blood
and
have
adjured
his
universal
suffrage
to
declare
in
the
face
of
gods
and
of
men
that
he
nero
had
not
killed
that
woman
his
universal
suffrage
working
much
as
yours
works
with
the
same
intelligence
and
the
same
liberty
might
have
affirmed
by
votes
that
the
divine
c√¶sar
nero
pontiff
and
emperor
had
done
no
harm
to
that
woman
who
lay
dead
understand
monsieur
that
nero
would
not
have
been
absolved
it
would
have
sufficed
for
one
voice
one
single
voice
on
earth
the
humblest
and
most
obscure
to
lie
raised
amid
that
profound
night
of
the
roman
empire
and
to
cry
nero
is
a
parricide
for
the
echo
the
eternal
echo
of
the
human
conscience
to
repeat
for
ever
from
people
to
people
and
from
century
to
century
nero
slew
his
mother
well
that
voice
which
protests
in
the
darkness
is
mine
i
exclaim
and
doubt
not
that
the
universal
conscience
of
mankind
repeats
with
me
louis

book
vii
the

second
phase
the
oath
i
for
an
oath
an
oath
and
a
half
what
is
louis
bonaparte
he
is
perjury
personified
he
is
mental
reservation
incarnate
felony
in
flesh
and
bone
he
is
a
false
oath
wearing
a
general
hat
and
calling
himself
monseigneur
well
what
is
it
that
he
demands
of
france
this
an
oath
an
oath
indeed
after
the
of
december
and
the
of
december
after
the
inviolate
representatives
of
the
people
had
been
arrested
and
hunted
down
after
the
confiscation
of
the
republic
after
the
one
might
have
expected
from
this
malefactor
an
honest
cynical
laugh
at
the
oath
and
that
this
sbrigani
would
say
to
france
oh
yes
it
is
true
i
did
pledge
my
word
of
honour
it
is
very
funny
let
us
say
no
more
about
such
nonsense
not
so
he
requires
an
oath
and
so
mayors
gendarmes
judges
spies
prefects
generals
commissaries
of
police
magistrates
senators
councillors
of
state
legislators
clerks
it
is
said
it
is
his
will
this
idea
has
passed
through
his
head
he
will
have
it
so
it
is
his
good
pleasure
lose
no
time
start
off
you
to
the
registrar
you
to
a
confessional
you
under
the
eye
of
your
brigadier
you
to
the
minister
you
senators
to
the
tuileries
to
the
salon
of
the
marshals
you
spies
to
the
prefecture
of
police
you
first
presidents
and
to
bonaparte
hasten
in
carriages
on
foot
on
horseback
in
gown
in
scarf
in
court
dress
in
uniform
bespangled
embroidered
beplumed
with
cap
on
head
ruff
at
the
neck
sash
around
the
waist
and
sword
by
the
side
place
yourselves
some
before
the
plaster
bust
others
before
the
man
himself
very
good
there
you
are
all
of
you
none
are
missing
look
him
well
in
the
face
reflect
search
your
conscience
your
loyalty
your
decency
your
religion
take
off
your
glove
raise
your
hand
and
take
oath
to
his
perjury
swear
fealty
to
his
treason
have
you
done
it
yes
ah
what
a
precious
farce
so
louis
bonaparte
takes
the
oath
true
he
believes
in
my
word
in
yours
in
ours
in
theirs
he
believes
everybody
word
but
his
own
he
demands
that
everybody
about
him
shall
swear
and
he
orders
them
to
be
loyal
it
pleases
messalina
to
be
surrounded
by
virgins
capital
he
requires
all
to
be
honourable
you
must
understand
this
and
you
maupas
must
look
upon
it
as
final
but
let
us
sift
things
to
the
bottom
there
are
oaths
and
oaths
the
oath
which
freely
solemnly
before
the
face
of
god
and
man
having
received
a
note
of
confidence
from
of
citizens
one
swears
before
the
national
assembly
to
the
constitution
of
his
country
to
the
law
to
the
people
and
to
france
that
is
nothing
it
is
not
binding
one
can
trifle
with
it
laugh
at
it
and
some
fine
day
trample
it
under
foot
but
the
oath
that
one
swears
before
the
cannon
mouth
at
the
sword
point
under
the
eye
of
the
police
in
order
to
retain
the
employment
that
gives
one
food
to
preserve
the
rank
which
is
property
the
oath
which
to
save
one
daily
bread
and
that
of
children
one
swears
to
a
villain
a
rebel
the
violator
of
the
laws
the
slaughterer
of
the
republic
a
fugitive
from
every
court
the
man
who
himself
has
broken
his
oath
oh
that
oath
is
sacred
let
us
not
jest
the
oath
that
we
take
on
the
of
december
nephew
of
the
brumaire
is
sacrosanct
what
i
admire
most
is
its
ineptitude
to
receive
as
so
much
ready
money
and
coin
of
good
alloy
all
those
i
swear
of
the
official
commons
not
even
to
think
that
every
scruple
has
been
overcome
and
that
there
can
not
be
in
them
all
one
single
word
of
pure
metal
he
is
both
a
prince
and
a
traitor
to
set
the
example
from
the
summit
of
the
state
and
to
imagine
that
it
will
not
be
followed
to
sow
lead
and
expect
to
reap
gold
not
even
to
perceive
that
in
such
a
case
every
conscience
will
model
itself
on
the
conscience
at
the
summit
and
that
the
perjury
of
the
prince
transmutes
all
oaths
into
counterfeit
coin
ii
difference
in
price
and
from
whom
then
are
oaths
required
from
that
prefect
he
has
betrayed
the
state
from
that
general
he
has
betrayed
his
colours
from
that
magistrate
he
has
betrayed
the
law
from
all
these
they
have
betrayed
the
republic
a
strange
thing
and
calculated
to
make
the
philosopher
reflect
is
this
heap
of
traitors
from
which
comes
this
heap
of
oaths
let
us
then
dwell
upon
this
charming
feature
of
the
of
december
bonaparte
louis
believes
in
men
oaths
he
believes
in
the
oaths
that
one
takes
to
him
when
rouher
takes
off
his
glove
and
says
i
swear
when
suin
takes
off
his
glove
and
says
i
swear
when
troplong
places
his
hand
upon
his
breast
on
that
spot
where
is
placed
the
third
button
of
a
senator
and
the
heart
of
other
men
and
says
i
swear
bonaparte
feels
tears
in
his
eyes
deeply
moved
he
foots
up
all
these
loyalties
and
contemplates
all
these
creatures
with
profound
emotion
he
trusts
he
believes
oh
abyss
of
candour
really
the
innocence
of
rogues
sometimes
elicits
the
wonder
of
honest
men
one
thing
however
must
astonish
the
observer
and
vex
him
a
little
that
is
the
capricious
and
disproportionate
manner
in
which
oaths
are
paid
for
the
inequality
of
the
prices
that
bonaparte
places
on
this
commodity
for
example
vidocq
if
he
were
still
chief
of
police
would
receive
six
thousand
francs
per
annum
baroche
receives
eighty
thousand
it
follows
then
that
the
oath
of
vidocq
would
bring
him
in
but
francs
centimes
per
day
while
the
oath
of
baroche
brings
him
in
francs
centimes
this
is
evidently
unjust
why
such
a
difference
an
oath
is
an
oath
an
oath
consists
of
a
glove
removed
and
six
letters
how
much
more
is
there
in
baroche
oath
than
in
vidocq
you
will
tell
me
that
it
is
owing
to
the
difference
of
their
functions
that
baroche
presides
in
the
council
of
state
and
that
vidocq
would
be
merely
the
chief
of
police
my
answer
is
that
it
is
but
chance
that
probably
baroche
might
excel
in
directing
the
police
and
that
vidocq
might
very
well
be
president
of
the
council
of
state
this
is
no
reason
are
there
then
several
sorts
of
oaths
is
it
the
same
as
with
masses
are
there
in
this
business
also
masses
at
forty
sous
and
masses
at
ten
sous
which
latter
as
the
priest
said
are
but
rubbish
does
the
quality
of
the
oath
vary
with
the
price
are
there
in
this
commodity
of
the
oath
superfine
fine
and
are
some
oaths
better
than
others
are
they
more
durable
less
adulterated
with
tow
and
cotton
better
dyed
are
there
new
oaths
still
unused
oaths
worn
at
the
knees
patched
oaths
and
ragged
oaths
is
there
any
choice
let
us
know
it
the
thing
is
worth
while
it
is
we
who
pay
having
made
these
observations
in
the
interest
of
those
who
are
contributors
i
humbly
beg
pardon
of
vidocq
for
having
made
use
of
his
name
i
admit
that
i
had
no
right
to
do
so
besides
vidocq
might
possibly
have
refused
the
oath
iii
oaths
of
scientific
and
literary
men
here
is
a
priceless
detail
bonaparte
was
desirous
that
arago
should
take
the
oath
understand
astronomy
must
swear
fealty
in
a
state
like
france
or
china
everything
is
bureaucracy
even
science
the
mandarin
of
the
institute
depends
upon
the
mandarin
of
the
police
the
great
parallactic
telescope
owes
homage
to
bonaparte
an
astronomer
is
a
sort
of
constable
of
the
heavens
the
observatory
is
like
any
it
is
necessary
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
good
god
up
yonder
who
seems
sometimes
not
to
submit
absolutely
to
the
constitution
of
the
of
january
the
heavens
are
full
of
unpleasant
allusions
and
require
to
be
kept
in
order
the
discovery
of
a
new
spot
on
the
sun
is
evidently
a
case
for
the
censorship
the
prediction
of
a
high
tide
may
be
seditious
the
announcement
of
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
may
be
treason
we
are
a
bit
moonstruck
at
the
√©lys√©e
free
astronomy
is
almost
as
dangerous
as
a
free
press
who
can
tell
what
takes
place
in
those
nocturnal
between
arago
and
jupiter
if
it
were
leverrier
well
and
good
but
a
member
of
the
provincial
government
beware
de
maupas
the
bureau
of
longitude
must
make
oath
not
to
conspire
with
the
stars
and
especially
with
those
mad
artisans
of
celestial
which
are
called
comets
then
too
as
we
have
already
said
one
is
a
fatalist
when
one
is
a
bonaparte
napoleon
the
great
had
his
star
napoleon
the
little
ought
surely
to
have
a
nebula
the
astronomers
are
certainly
something
of
astrologers
so
take
the
oath
gentlemen
it
goes
without
saying
that
arago
refused
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
oath
to
louis
bonaparte
is
that
according
as
it
is
refused
or
taken
that
oath
gives
you
or
takes
from
you
merits
aptitudes
talents
you
are
a
professor
of
greek
or
latin
take
the
oath
or
you
are
deprived
of
your
chair
and
you
no
longer
know
greek
or
latin
you
are
a
professor
of
rhetoric
take
the
oath
or
tremble
the
story
of
theramenes
and
the
dream
of
athalie
are
interdicted
you
shall
wander
about
them
for
the
rest
of
your
days
and
never
again
be
permitted
to
enter
you
are
a
professor
of
philosophy
take
the
oath
to
bonaparte
if
not
you
become
incapable
of
understanding
the
mysteries
of
the
human
conscience
and
of
explaining
them
to
young
men
you
are
a
professor
of
medicine
take
the
oath
if
not
you
no
longer
know
how
to
feel
the
pulse
of
a
feverish
patient
but
if
the
good
professors
depart
will
there
be
any
more
good
pupils
particularly
in
medicine
this
is
a
serious
matter
what
is
to
become
of
the
sick
the
sick
as
if
we
cared
about
the
sick
the
important
thing
is
that
medicine
should
take
the
oath
to
bonaparte
for
it
comes
to
this
either
the
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
votes
have
no
sense
or
it
is
evident
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
your
leg
amputated
by
an
ass
who
has
taken
the
oath
than
by
a
refractory
dupuytren
ah
one
would
fain
jest
but
all
this
makes
the
heart
sad
are
you
a
young
and
generous
spirit
like
deschanel
a
sane
and
upright
intellect
like
despois
a
serious
and
powerful
mind
like
jacques
an
eminent
writer
a
popular
historian
like
michelet
take
the
oath
or
die
of
hunger
they
refuse
the
darkness
and
silence
in
which
they
stoically
seek
refuge
know
the
rest
iv
curiosities
of
the
business
all
morality
is
denied
by
such
an
oath
the
cup
of
shame
drained
to
the
dregs
all
decency
outraged
there
is
no
reason
why
one
should
not
see
things
and
one
sees
them
in
some
towns
evreux
for
example
the
judges
who
have
taken
the
oath
sit
in
judgment
on
the
judges
who
have
refused
it
dishonour
seated
on
the
bench
places
honour
at
the
bar
the
sold
conscience
reproves
the
upright
conscience
the
courtesan
lashes
the
virgin
the
president
of
the
tribunal
of
commerce
at
evreux
refused
to
take
the
oath
let
us
listen
to
the
verney
late
president
of
the
tribunal
of
commerce
at
evreux
was
cited
to
appear
on
thursday
last
before
the
correctional
judges
of
evreux
on
account
of
facts
that
took
place
on
the
of
april
last
within
the
consular
auditory
verney
is
accused
of
inciting
to
hatred
and
treason
against
the
government
the
judges
of
first
instance
discharged
verney
and
reproved
him
appeal
by
the
procureur
of
the
republic
sentence
of
the
court
of
appeal
of
rouen
the
court
whereas
the
prosecution
has
no
other
object
than
the
repression
of
the
crime
of
inciting
to
hatred
and
scorn
of
the
government
whereas
that
offence
would
result
according
to
the
prosecution
from
the
last
paragraph
of
the
letter
of
verney
to
the
procureur
of
the
republic
at
evreux
on
the
of
april
last
which
is
thus
worded
it
would
be
too
serious
a
matter
to
barter
any
longer
what
we
conceive
to
be
right
the
magistracy
itself
will
owe
us
thanks
for
not
exposing
the
ermine
of
the
judge
to
succumb
under
the
formality
which
your
dispatch
announces
whereas
however
blamable
conduct
of
verney
has
been
in
this
the
court
can
not
see
in
that
portion
of
the
letter
the
offence
of
inciting
to
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
government
since
the
order
by
which
force
was
to
be
employed
to
prevent
the
judges
from
taking
their
seats
who
had
refused
to
take
the
oaths
did
not
emanate
from
the
government
whereas
there
is
no
ground
therefore
for
applying
to
him
the
penal
code
for
these
reasons
confirms
the
judgment
without
costs
the
court
of
appeal
at
rouen
has
for
its
first
president
formerly
to
the
court
of
peers
in
the
prosecution
at
boulogne
the
same
who
addressed
to
louis
bonaparte
these
words
you
have
caused
corruption
to
be
employed
and
money
to
be
distributed
to
buy
treason
with
this
oath
one
journeys
from
surprise
to

nicolet
was
but
a
booby
compared
to
bonaparte
when
bonaparte
had
had
the
circuit
made
of
his
valets
his
accomplices
and
his
victims
and
had
pocketed
all
their
oaths
he
turned
to
the
valiant
chiefs
of
the
african
army
and
spoke
to
them
nearly
in
these
words
by
the
bye
you
are
aware
i
caused
you
to
be
arrested
at
night
by
my
men
when
you
were
in
your
beds
my
spies
broke
into
your
domiciles
sword

i
have
in
fact
decorated
them
for
that
feat
of
arms
i
caused
you
to
be
threatened
with
the
gag
if
you
uttered
a
cry
my
agents
took
you
by
the
collar
i
have
had
you
placed
in
a

at

from
the
blow
there
is
one
other
variety
of
the
oath
in
the
fortresses
in
the
prisons
in
the
hulks
in
the
jails
of

there
are
thousands
of
prisoners
who
are
those
prisoners
we
have
said
republicans
patriots
soldiers
of
the
law
innocent
men
martyrs
their
sufferings
have
already
been
proclaimed
by
generous
voices
and
one
has
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
in
our
special
volume
on
the
of
december
it
shall
be
our
task
to
tear
asunder
the
veil
do
you
wish
to
know
what
is
taking
place
sometimes
when
endurance
is
at
an
end
and
strength
exhausted
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
misery
without
shoes
without
bread
without
clothing
without
a
shirt
consumed
by
fever
devoured
by
vermin
poor
artisans
torn
from
their
workshops
poor
husbandmen
forcibly
taken
from
the
plough
weeping
for
a
wife
a
mother
children
a
family
widowed
or
orphaned
also
without
bread
and
perhaps
without
shelter
overdone
ill
dying
despairing
some
of
these
wretched
beings
succumb
and
consent
to
ask
for
pardon
then
a
letter
is
presented
for
their
signature
all
written
and
addressed
to
monseigneur
le
we
give
publicity
to
this
letter
as
sieur
quentin

avows
it
i
the

declare
upon
my
honour
that
i
accept
the
pardon
offered
me
by
prince
and
i
engage
never
to
become
a
member
of
any
secret
society
to
respect
the
law
and
be
to
the
government
that
the
country
has
chosen
by
the
votes
of
the
and
of
december
let
not
the
meaning
of
this
grave
performance
be
misunderstood
this
is
not
clemency
granted
it
is
clemency
implored
this
formula
ask
us
for
your
pardon
means
grant
us
our
pardon
the
murderer
leaning
over
his

with
his
knife
raised
cries
i
have
waylaid
you
seized
you
hurled
you
to
the
earth
despoiled

you
passed
my

and
now
you
are
under
my
feet
your
blood
is
oozing
from
twenty
wounds
you
and
i
will
not
finish
you
this
exacted
by
a
criminal
from
an
innocent
man
is
nothing
else
than
the
outward
form
which
his
inward
remorse
assumes
he
fancies
that
he
is
thus
safeguarded
against
his
own
criminality
whatever
expedient
he
may
adopt
to
deaden
his
feelings
although
he
may
be
for
ever
ringing
in
his
own
ears
the
seven
million
five
hundred
thousand
little
bells
of
his
plebiscite
the
man
of
the
reflects
at
times
he
catches
vague
glimpses
of
a
tomorrow
and
struggles
against
the
inevitable
future
he
must
have
legal
purgation
discharge
release
from
custody
quittance
he
exacts
it
from
the
vanquished
and
at
need
puts
them
to
the
torture
to
obtain
it
louis
bonaparte
knows
that
there
exists
in
the
conscience
of
every
prisoner
of
every
exile
of
every
man
proscribed
a
tribunal
and
that
that
tribunal
is
beginning
his
prosecution
he
trembles
the
executioner
feels
a
secret
dread
of
his
victim
and
under
pretext
of
a
pardon
accorded
by
him
to
that
victim
he
forces
his
judges
to
sign
his
acquittal
thus
he
hopes
to
deceive
france
which
too
is
a
living
conscience
and
a
watchful
tribunal
and
that
when
the
hour
for
passing
sentence
shall
strike
seeing
that
he
has
been
absolved
by
his
victims
she
will
pardon
him
he
deceives
himself
let
him
cut
a
hole
in
the
wall
on
another
side
he
will
not
escape
through
that
one
v
the
of
april
on
the
of
april
this
is
what
was
witnessed
at
the
tuileries
about
eight
in
the
evening
the
was
filled
with
men
in
scarlet
robes
grave
and
majestic
speaking
with
subdued
voices
holding
in
their
hands
black
velvet
caps
bedecked
with
gold
lace
most
of
them
were
these
were
the
presidents
and
councillors
of
the
court
of
cassation
the
first
presidents
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
all
the
superior
magistracy
of
france
these
persons
were
kept
waiting
in
the
an
ushered
them
in
and
left
them
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
half
an
hour
an
hour
they
wandered
up
and
down
the
room
conversing
looking
at
their
watches
awaiting
the
ringing
of
the
bell
after
more
than
an
hour
of
tedious
waiting
they
perceived
that
they
had
not
even
chairs
to
sit
upon
one
of
them
troplong
went
to
another
room
where
the
footmen
were
and
complained
a
chair
was
brought
him
at
last
a
was
thrown
open
they
rushed
into
a
salon
there
a
man
in
a
black
coat
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
what
errand
summoned
these
men
in
red
robes
to
this
man
in
a
black
coat
they
came
to
tender
him
their
oaths
the
man
was
bonaparte
he
nodded
and
in
return
they
bowed
to
the
ground
as
is
meet
in
front
of
bonaparte
at
a
short
distance
stood
his
chancellor
abbattucci
late
a
liberal
deputy
now
minister
of
justice
to
the
the
ceremony
began
abbattucci
delivered
a
discourse
and
bonaparte
made
a
speech
the
prince
drawled
a
few
contemptuous
words
looking
at
the
carpet
he
spoke
of
his
legitimacy
after
which
the
magistrates
took
the
oath
each
in
turn
raised
his
hand
while
they
were
swearing
bonaparte
his
back
half
turned
to
them
laughed
and
chatted
with
his
who
were
grouped
behind
him
when
it
was
over
he
quite
turned
his
back
upon
them
and
they
departed
shaking
their
heads
humbled
and
ashamed
not
for
having
done
a
base
deed
but
because
they
had
had
no
chairs
in
the
as
they
were
departing
the
following
dialogue
was
overheard
that
said
one
of
them
was
an
oath
it
was
necessary
to
take
and
said
another
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
keep
yes
said
a
third
like
the
master
of
the
house
all
this
is
pure
servility
let
us
proceed
among
these
first
presidents
who
swore
fidelity
to
louis
bonaparte
were
a
certain
number
of
former
peers
of
france
who
as
such
had
passed
upon
louis
bonaparte
the
sentence
of
perpetual
imprisonment
but
why
should
we
look
back
so
far
let
us
still
proceed
here
is
something
even
better
among
these
magistrates
there
were
seven
individuals
by
name
hardouin
moreau
pataille
cauchy
delapalme
grandet
and
quesnault
prior
to
the
of
december
these
seven
men
composed
the
high
court
of
justice
the
first
hardouin
was
president
the
last
two
the
other
four
judges
these
men
had
received
and
accepted
from
the
constitution
of
a
mandate
thus
conceived
article
every
measure
by
which
the
president
of
the
republic
shall
dissolve
the
national
assembly
prorogue
it
or
impede
the
performance
of
its
decrees
is
high
treason
the
judges
of
the
high
court
shall
thereupon
immediately
assemble
under
penalty
of
forfeiture
they
shall
convoke
the
jurors
in
such
place
as
they
shall
appoint
to
proceed
to
the
trial
of
the
president
and
his
accomplices
they
shall
themselves
appoint
magistrates
to
perform
the
functions
of
the
national
administration
on
the
of
december
in
the
face
of
the
flagrant
felony
they
had
begun
the
trial
and
appointed
a
renouard
who
had
accepted
the
office
to
proceed
against
louis
bonaparte
on
the
charge
of
high
treason
let
us
add
the
name
of
renouard
to
the
seven
on
the
of
april
they
were
all
eight
present
in
the
antechamber
of
louis
bonaparte
we
have
just
seen
what
was
their
business
there
here
it
is
impossible
not
to
pause
there
are
certain
melancholy
thoughts
upon
which
one
must
have
the
strength
to
insist
there
are
sinks
of
ignominy
we
must
have
the
courage
to
sound
cast
your
eyes
upon
that
man
he
was
born
at
hazard
by
misfortune
in
a
hovel
in
a
cellar
in
a
cave
no
one
knows
where
no
one
knows
of
whom
he
came
out
of
the
dust
to
fall
into
the
mire
he
had
only
so
much
father
and
mother
as
was
necessary
for
his
birth
after
which
all
shrank
from
him
he
has
crawled
on
as
best
he
could
he
grew
up
in
rags
with
no
idea
why
he
was
living
he
can
neither
read
nor
write
nor
does
he
know
that
there
are
laws
above
him
he
scarcely
knows
there
is
a
heaven
he
has
no
home
no
family
no
creed
no
book
he
is
a
blind
soul
his
intellect
has
never
opened
for
intellect
opens
only
to
light
as
flowers
open
only
to
the
day
and
he
dwells
in
the
dark
however
he
must
eat
society
has
made
him
a
brute
beast
hunger
makes
him
a
wild
beast
he
lies
in
wait
for
travellers
on
the
outskirts
of
a
wood
and
robs
them
of
their
purses
he
is
caught
and
sent
to
the
galleys
so
far
so
good
now
look
at
this
other
man
it
is
no
longer
the
red
cap
it
is
the
red
robe
he
believes
in
god
reads
nicole
is
a
jansenist
devout
goes
to
confession
takes
the
sacrament
he
is
well
born
as
they
say
wants
nothing
nor
has
ever
wanted
anything
his
parents
have
lavished
everything
on
his
youth
trouble
instruction
advice
greek
and
latin
masters
in
every
science
he
is
a
grave
and
scrupulous
personage
therefore
he
has
been
made
a
magistrate
seeing
this
man
pass
his
days
in
meditating
upon
all
the
great
texts
both
sacred
and
profane
in
the
study
of
the
law
in
the
practice
of
religion
in
the
contemplation
of
the
just
and
unjust
society
placed
in
his
keeping
all
that
it
holds
most
august
most
venerable
the
book
of
the
law
it
made
him
a
judge
and
the
punisher
of
treason
it
said
to
him
a
day
may
come
an
hour
may
strike
when
the
chief
by
physical
force
shall
trample
under
his
foot
both
the
law
and
the
rights
of
man
then
you
man
of
justice
you
will
arise
and
smite
with
your
rod
the
man
of
power
for
that
purpose
and
in
expectation
of
that
perilous
and
supreme
day
it
lavishes
wealth
upon
him
and
clothes
him
in
purple
and
ermine
that
day
arrives
that
hour
unique
pitiless
and
solemn
that
supreme
hour
of
duty
the
man
in
the
red
gown
begins
to
stutter
the
words
of
the
law
suddenly
he
perceives
that
it
is
not
the
cause
of
justice
that
prevails
but
that
treason
carries
the
day
whereupon
he
the
man
who
has
passed
his
life
in
imbuing
himself
with
the
pure
and
holy
light
of
the
law
that
man
who
is
nothing
unless
he
be
the
contemner
of
unmerited
success
that
lettered
scrupulous
religious
man
that
judge
in
whose
keeping
the
law
has
been
placed
and
in
some
sort
the
conscience
of
the
state
turns
towards
triumphant
perjury
and
with
the
same
lips
the
same
voice
in
which
if
this
traitor
had
been
vanquished
he
would
have
said
criminal
i
sentence
you
to
the
galleys
he
says
monseigneur
i
swear
fealty
to
you
now
take
a
balance
place
in
one
scale
the
judge
in
the
other
the
felon
and
tell
me
which
side
kicks
the
beam
vi
everywhere
the
oath
such
are
the
things
we
have
beheld
in
france
on
the
occasion
of
the
oath
to
bonaparte
men
have
sworn
here
there
everywhere
at
paris
in
the
provinces
in
the
north
in
the
south
in
the
cast
and
in
the
west
there
was
in
france
during
a
whole
month
a
tableau
of
hands
raised
of
arms
outstretched
and
the
final
chorus
was
we
swear
etc
the
ministers
placed
their
oaths
in
the
hands
of
the
president
the
prefects
in
those
of
ministers
and
the
mob
in
those
of
the
prefects
what
does
bonaparte
do
with
all
these
oaths
is
he
making
a
collection
of
them
where
does
he
put
them
it
has
been
remarked
that
none
but
unpaid
functionaries
have
refused
the
oath
the
for
instance
the
fact
is
that
the
oath
has
been
taken
to
the
budget
we
heard
on
the
of
march
a
senator
exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
against
the
omission
of
his
name
which
was
so
to
speak
vicarious
modesty
sibour
archbishop
of
paris
swore
frank
carr√©
to
the
court
of
peers
in
the
affair
of
boulogne
swore
dupin
president
of
the
national
assembly
on
the
of
december
swore
o
my
god
it
is
enough
to
make
one
wring
one
hands
for
shame
an
oath
however
is
a
sacred
obligation
as
senator
as
first
president
of
the
court
of
appeal
at
rouen
as
a
member
of
his
municipal
council
the
man
who
takes
an
oath
ceases
to
be
a
man
he
becomes
an
altar
upon
which
god
descends
man
that
infirmity
that
shadow
that
atom
that
grain
of
sand
that
drop
of
water
that
tear
dropped
from
the
eye
of
destiny
man
so
little
so
weak
so
uncertain
so
ignorant
so
restless
man
who
lives
in
trouble
and
in
doubt
knowing
little
of
yesterday
and
nothing
of
seeing
just
enough
of
his
road
to
place
his
foot
before
him
and
then
nothing
but
darkness
who
trembles
if
he
looks
forward
is
sad
if
he
looks
back
man
enveloped
in
those
immensities
and
those
obscurities
time
space
and
being
and
lost
in
them
having
an
abyss
within
him
his
soul
and
an
abyss
without
heaven
man
who
at
certain
hours
bows
his
head
with
a
sacred
horror
under
every
force
of
nature
under
the
roar
of
the
sea
under

in

i
the
quantum
of
good
contained
in

among
us
democrats
many
minds
were
stupefied
by
the
event
of
the
of
december
it
disconcerted
some
discouraged
others
and
terrified
many
i
have
seen
some
who
cried
as
for
myself
since
at
certain
times
i
am
obliged
to
say
i
and
to
speak
in
the
face
of
history
as
a
witness
i
proclaim
that
i
saw
that
event
without
perturbation
i
say
more
than
this
that
at
times
in
the
face
of
the
of
december
i
declare
myself
satisfied
when
i
can
abstract
myself
from
the
present
when
for
a
moment
i
can
turn
my
eyes
away
from
all
the
crimes
from
all
the
blood
spilt
from
all
the
victims
from
all
the
proscribed
from
those
hulks
that
echo
the
death
rattle
from
those
deadful
penal
settlements
of
lambessa
and
cayenne
where
death
is
swift
from
that
exile
where
death
is
slow
from
this
vote
from
this
oath
from
this
vast
stain
of
shame
inflicted
upon
france
which
is
growing
wider
and
wider
each
day
when
forgetting
for
a
few
moments
these
painful
thoughts
the
usual
obsession
of
my
mind
i
succeed
in
confining
myself
within
the
severe
calmness
of
the
politician
and
in
considering
not
the
fact
but
the
consequences
of
the
fact
then
among
many
results
disastrous
beyond
doubt
a
considerable
real
enormous
progress
becomes
manifest
to
me
and
from
that
moment
while
i
am
still
of
those
whom
the
of
december
exasperates
i
am
no
longer
of
those
whom
it
afflicts
fixing
my
eyes
upon
certain
points
in
the
future
i
say
to
myself
the
deed
was
infamous
but
the
result
is
good
attempts
have
been
made
to
explain
the
inexplicable
victory
of
the
in
a
hundred
ways
a
true
balance
has
been
struck
between
all
possible
resistances
and
they
are
neutralized
one
by
the
other
the
people
were
afraid
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
bourgeoisie
were
afraid
of
the
people
the
faubourgs
hesitated
before
the
restoration
of
the
majority
fearing
wrongfully
however
that
their
victory
would
bring
back
to
power
that
right
which
is
so
thoroughly
unpopular
the
shopocracy
recoiled
before
the
red
republic
the
people
did
not
understand
the
middle
classes
shuffled
some
said
whom
shall
we
send
to
the
legislative
palace
others
whom
are
we
going
to
see
at
the
hotel
de
ville
in
fine
the
rude
repression
of
the
insurrection
crushed
by
the
quarries
the
casements
and
the
transportations
a
living
and
terrible
recollection
and
then
suppose
some
one
had
succeeded
in
beating
the
call
to
arms
suppose
a
single
legion
had
sallied
forth
suppose
sibour
had
been
affre
and
had
thrown
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
bullets
of
the
pretorians
suppose
the
high
court
had
not
suffered
itself
to
be
driven
away
by
a
corporal
suppose
the
judges
had
followed
the
example
of
the
representatives
and
we
had
seen
the
scarlet
gowns
on
the
barricades
as
we
saw
the
scarfs
suppose
a
single
arrest
had
miscarried
suppose
a
single
regiment
had
hesitated
suppose
the
massacre
on
the
boulevards
had
not
taken
place
or
had
turned
out
ill
for
louis
bonaparte
etc
this
is
all
true
and
yet
what
has
been
was
what
was
to
be
let
us
say
again
under
the
shadow
of
that
monstrous
victory
vast
and
definitive
progress
is
taking
place
the
of
december
succeeded
because
in
more
than
one
point
of
view
i
repeat
it
was
good
that
it
should
succeed
all
explanations
are
just
but
all
are
vain
the
invisible
hand
is
mingled
in
all
this
louis
bonaparte
committed
the
crime
providence
brought
about
the
result
in
truth
it
was
essential
that
should
come
to
the
end
of
its
logic
it
was
essential
that
people
should
learn
and
should
learn
for
all
time
that
in
the
mouths
of
the
men
of
the
past
that
word
signifies
false
oaths
perjury
pillage
of
the
public
civil
war
confiscation
sequestration
deportation
transportation
proscription
fusillades
police
censorship
degradation
of
the
army
disregard
of
the
people
debasement
of
france
a
dumb
senate
the
tribune
overthrown
the
press
suppressed
a
political
guillotine
murder
of
liberty
garroting
of
the
right
violation
of
laws
sovereignty
of
the
sword
massacre
treason
ambuscades
the
spectacle
that
we
have
before
our
eyes
is
a
profitable
spectacle
what
we
see
in
france
since
the
of
december
is
the
debauch
of
order
yes
the
hand
of
providence
is
in
it
reflect
too
upon
this
for
fifty
years
the
republic
and
the
empire
have
filled
men
imaginations
the
one
with
its
souvenirs
of
terror
the
other
with
its
souvenirs
of
glory
of
the
republic
men
saw
only
that
is
to
say
the
terrible
revolutionary
necessity
the
furnace
of
the
empire
they
saw
only
austerlitz
hence
a
prejudice
against
the
republic
and
prestige
for
the
empire
now
what
is
the
future
of
france
to
be
is
it
the
empire
no
it
is
the
republic
it
became
necessary
to
reverse
that
situation
to
suppress
the
prestige
of
that
which
can
not
be
restored
and
to
suppress
the
prejudice
against
that
which
must
be
providence
did
it
it
destroyed
those
two
mirages
february
came
and
took
away
from
the
republic
its
terror
louis
bonaparte
came
and
deprived
the
empire
of
its
prestige
henceforth
fraternity
is
superimposed
upon
terror
napoleon
the
little
is
superimposed
upon
napoleon
the
great
the
two
grand
things
one
of
which
alarmed
and
the
other
dazzled
are
receding
we
perceive
only
through
its
justification
and
napoleon
only
through
his
caricature
the
foolish
fear
of
the
guillotine
vanishes
the
empty
imperial
popularity
disappears
thanks
to
the
republic
no
longer
terrifies
thanks
to
louis
bonaparte
the
empire
no
longer
fascinates
the
future
has
become
possible
these
are
the
secrets
of
the
almighty
but
the
word
republic
is
not
sufficient
it
is
the
republic
that
is
wanting
well
we
shall
have
the
thing
with
the
word
let
us
develop
this
thought
ii
the
four
institutions
that
stand
opposed
to
the
republic
awaiting
the
marvellous
but
tardy
simplifications
which
the
union
of
europe
and
the
democratic
federation
of
the
continent
will
some
day
bring
forth
what
will
be
in
france
the
form
of
the
social
edifice
of
whose
and
luminous
outlines
the
thinking
man
already
has
a
glimpse
through
the
darkness
of
dictatorships
that
form
is
this
the
sovereign
commune
ruled
by
an
elective
mayor
universal
suffrage
everywhere
subordinate
to
the
national
unity
only
in
respect
to
acts
of
general
concern
so
much
for
the
administration
syndics
and
upright
men
arranging
the
private
differences
of
associations
and
industries
the
jury
magistrate
of
the
fact
enlightening
the
judge
magistrate
of
the
law
elective
judges
so
much
for
justice
the
priest
excluded
from
everything
except
the
church
living
with
his
eye
fixed
on
his
book
and
on
heaven
a
stranger
to
the
budget
unknown
to
the
state
known
only
to
his
flock
no
longer
possessing
authority
but
possessing
liberty
so
much
for
religion
war
confined
to
the
defence
of
the
territory
the
whole
nation
constituting
a
national
guard
divided
into
three
districts
and
able
to
rise
as
one
man
so
much
for
power
the
law
for
ever
the
right
for
ever
the
ballot
for
ever
the
sword
nowhere
now
what
were
the
obstacles
to
this
future
to
this
magnificent
realization
of
the
democratic
ideal
there
were
four
material
obstacles
namely
the
standing
army
centralized
administration
the
clergy
the
irremovable
magistracy
iii
slow
movement
of
normal
progress
what
these
four
obstacles
are
what
they
were
even
under
the
republic
of
february
even
under
the
constitution
of
the
evil
they
produced
the
good
they
prevented
what
sort
of
past
they
perpetuated
what
excellent
social
order
they
postponed
the
publicist
saw
the
philosopher
knew
the
nation
did
not
know
these
four
institutions
immense
ancient
solid
supported
one
upon
another
composite
at
their
base
and
summit
growing
like
a
hedge
of
tall
old
trees
their
roots
under
our
feet
their
branches
over
our
heads
smothered
and
crushed
on
all
sides
the
scattered
germs
of
the
new
france
where
life
and
movement
association
local
liberty
communal
initiative
should
have
been
there
was
administrative
despotism
where
there
should
have
been
the
intelligent
vigilance
armed
at
need
of
the
patriot
and
the
citizen
there
was
the
passive
obedience
of
the
soldier
where
the
quick
christian
faith
should
have
gushed
forth
there
was
the
catholic
priest
where
there
should
have
been
justice
there
was
the
judge
and
the
future
was
there
under
the
feet
of
suffering
generations
which
could
not
rise
and
were
waiting
was
this
known
among
the
people
was
it
suspected
was
it
divined
no
far
from
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
greater
part
and
of
the
middle
classes
in
particular
these
four
obstacles
were
four
buttresses
army
magistracy
administration
clergy
these
were
the
four
virtues
of
order
the
four
social
powers
the
four
sacred
pillars
of
the
old
french
structure
attack
that
if
you
dare
i
have
no
hesitation
is
saying
that
in
the
state
of
blindness
in
which
are
plunged
the
best
minds
with
the
measured
march
of
normal
progress
with
our
assemblies
of
which
i
shall
not
be
suspected
to
be
the
detractor
but
which
when
they
are
both
honest
and
timid
as
is
often
the
case
are
disposed
to
be
led
only
by
their
average
men
that
is
by
mediocrity
with
the
committees
of
initiative
their
delays
and
ballottings
if
the
of
december
had
not
brought
its
overwhelming
demonstration
if
providence
had
not
taken
a
hand
france
would
have
remained
condemned
for
an
indefinite
term
to
its
irremovable
magistracy
to
administrative
centralization
to
the
standing
army
and
to
the
clergy
surely
the
power
of
the
tribune
and
of
the
press
combined
these
two
great
forces
of
civilization
it
is
not
i
who
seek
to
deny
or
belittle
them
but
see
how
many
efforts
of
all
kinds
it
would
have
required
in
every
direction
and
under
every
form
by
the
tribune
and
by
the
newspaper
by
the
book
and
by
the
spoken
word
to
succeed
even
in
shaking
the
universal
prejudice
in
favor
of
these
four
fatal
institutions
how
many
to
succeed
in
overthrowing
them
to
exhibit
the
evidence
to
the
eyes
of
all
to
overcome
selfish
passionate
or
unintelligent
resistance
thoroughly
to
enlighten
public
opinion
the
consciences
of
the
people
and
the
ruling
powers
to
cause
this
fourfold
reform
to
force
its
way
first
into
ideas
then
into
the
laws
reckon
up
the
speeches
the
writings
the
newspaper
articles
the
projects
of

the
the

the

the

denials
the
storms
the

forward
the
steps
backward
the
days
the
weeks
the

the
years
the
the
iv
what
an
assembly
would
have
done
i
imagine
on
the
benches
of
an
assembly
the
most
intrepid
of
thinkers
a
brilliant
mind
one
of
those
men
who
when
they
ascend
the
tribune
feel
it
beneath
them
like
the
tripod
of
the
oracle
suddenly
grow
in
stature
and
become
colossal
surpass
by
a
head
the
massive
appearances
that
mask
reality
and
see
clearly
the
future
over
the
high
frowning
wall
of
the
present
that
man
that
orator
that
seer
seeks
to
warn
his
country
that
prophet
seeks
to
enlighten
statesmen
he
knows
where
the
breakers
are
he
knows
that
society
will
crumble
by
means
of
these
four
false
supports
centralized
government
standing
army
irremovable
judges
salaried
priesthood
he
knows
it
he
desires
that
all
should
know
it
he
ascends
the
tribune
and
says
i
denounce
to
you
four
great
public
perils
your
political
system
bears
that
within
it
that
will
destroy
it
it
is
incumbent
upon
you
to
transform
your
government
root
and
branch
the
army
the
clergy
and
the
magistracy
to
suppress
here
retrench
there
remodel
everything
or
perish
through
these
four
institutions
which
you
consider
as
lasting
elements
but
which
are
elements
of
dissolution
murmurs
he
exclaims
do
you
know
what
your
centralized
administration
may
become
in
the
hands
of
a
perjured
executive
power
a
vast
treason
carried
into
effect
at
one
blow
over
the
whole
of
france
by
every
without
exception
murmurs
break
out
anew
with
redoubled
violence
cries
of
order
the
orator
continues
do
you
know
what
your
standing
army
may
become
at
any
moment
an
instrument
of
crime
passive
obedience
is
the
bayonet
ever
pointed
at
the
heart
of
the
law
yes
here
in
this
france
which
is
the
initiatress
of
the
world
in
this
land
of
the
tribune
and
the
press
in
this
birthplace
of
human
thought
yes
the
time
may
come
when
the
sword
will
rule
when
you
inviolable
legislators
will
be
collared
by
corporals
when
our
glorious
regiments
will
transform
themselves
for
the
profit
of
one
man
and
to
the
shame
of
the
nation
into
hordes
and
pretorian
bands
when
the
sword
of
france
will
become
a
thing
that
strikes
from
behind
like
the
dagger
of
a
hired
assassin
when
the
of
the
first
city
in
the
world
done
to
death
will
splash
the
gold
epaulettes
of
your
generals
the
murmur
becomes
an
uproar
cries
of
order
are
heard
from
all
quarters
the
orator
is
interrupted
you
have
been
insulting
the
government
now
you
insult
the
army
the
president
calls
the
orator
to
order
the
orator
resumes
and
if
it
should
happen
some
day
that
a
man
having
in
his
hand
the
five
hundred
thousand
officeholders
who
constitute
the
government
and
the
four
hundred
thousand
soldiers
composing
the
army
if
it
should
happen
that
this
man
should
tear
up
the
constitution
should
violate
every
law
break
every
oath
trample
upon
every
right
commit
every
crime
do
you
know
what
your
irremovable
magistrates
instructors
in
the
right
and
guardians
of
the
law
would
do
they
would
hold
their
tongues
the
uproar
prevents
the
orator
from
completing
his
sentence
the
tumult
becomes
a
this
man
respects
nothing
after
the
government
and
the
army
he
drags
the
magistracy
in
the
mire
censure
censure
the
orator
is
censured
and
the
censure
entered
in
the
journal
the
president
declares
that
if
he
continues
the
assembly
will
proceed
to
a
vote
and
the
floor
will
be
taken
from
him
the
orator
continues
and
your
paid
clergy
and
your
bishops
on
the
day
when
a
pretender
shall
have
employed
in
such
enterprises
the
government
the
magistracy
and
the
army
on
the
day
when
all
these
institutions
shall
drip
with
the
blood
shed
by
and
for
the
traitor
when
placed
between
the
man
who
has
committed
the
crimes
and
god
who
orders
an
anathema
to
be
launched
against
the
criminal
do
you
know
what
these
bishops
of
yours
will
do
they
will
prostrate
themselves
not
before
god
but
before
man
can
you
form
any
idea
of
the
frenzied
shouts
and
imprecations
that
would
greet
such
words
can
you
imagine
the
shouts
the
apostrophes
the
threats
the
whole
assembly
rising
the
tribune
escaladed
and
with
difficulty
guarded
by
the
ushers
the
orator
has
profaned
every
sanctified
ark
in
succession
and
he
has
ended
by
profaning
the
holy
of
holies
the
clergy
and
what
does
he
mean
by
it
all
what
a
medley
of
impossible
and
infamous
hypotheses
do
you
not
hear
baroche
growl
and
dupin
thunder
the
orator
would
be
called
to
order
censured
fined
suspended
from
the
chamber
for
three
days
like
pierre
leroux
and
√©mile
de
girardin
who
can
tell
perhaps
expelled
like
manuel
and
the
next
day
the
indignant
citizen
would
say
that
is
well
done
and
from
every
quarter
the
journals
devoted
to
order
would
shake
their
fist
at
the
calumniator
and
in
his
own
party
on
his
usual
bench
in
the
assembly
his
best
friends
would
forsake
him
and
say
it
is
his
own
fault
he
has
gone
too
far
he
has
imagined
chimeras
and
absurdities
and
after
this
generous
and
heroic
effort
it
would
be
found
that
the
four
institutions
that
have
been
attacked
were
more
venerable
and
impeccable
than
ever
and
that
the
question
instead
of
advancing
had
receded
v
what
providence
has
done
but
providence
providence
goes
about
it
differently
it
places
the
thing
luminously
before
your
eyes
and
says
behold
a
man
arrives
some
fine
morning
and
such
a
man
the
first
comer
the
last
comer
without
past
without
future
without
genius
without
renown
without
prestige
is
he
an
adventurer
is
he
a
prince
this
man
has
his
hands
full
of
money
of
of
railroad
shares
of
offices
of
decorations
of
sinecures
this
man
stoops
down
to
the
and
says
betray
your
trust
the
betray
their
trust
what
all
without
one
exception
yes
all
he
turns
to
the
generals
and
says
generals
massacre
and
the
generals
massacre
he
turns
towards
the
irremovable
judges
and
says
magistrates
i
shatter
the
constitution
i
commit
perjury
i
dissolve
the
sovereign
assembly
i
arrest
the
inviolate
members
i
plunder
the
public
treasury
i
sequester
i
confiscate
i
banish
those
who
displease
me
i
transport
people
according
to
my
fancy
i
shoot
down
without

to

i
execute
without

i
commit
all
that
men
are
agreed
in
calling
crime
i
outrage
all
that
men
are
agreed
in
calling
right
behold
the
laws
they
are
under
my
feet
we
will
pretend
not
to
see
any
thing
say
the
magistrates
you
are
insolent
replies
the
providential
man
to
turn
your
eyes
away
is
to
insult
me
i
propose
that
you
shall
assist
me
judges
you
are
going
to
congratulate
me
me
who
am
force
and
crime
and
those
who
have
resisted
me
those
who
are
honor
right
and
law
them
you
will
try
and
you
will
condemn
them
these
irremovable
judges
kiss
his
boot
and
set
about
investigating
des
they
swear
fidelity
to
him
to
boot
then
he
perceives
in
a
corner
the
clergy
endowed
with
cross
and
cope
and
mitre
and
he
says
ah
you
are
there
archbishop
come
here
just
bless
all
this
for
me
and
the
archbishop
chants
his
vi
what
the
ministers
army
magistracy
and
clergy
have
done
oh
what
a
striking
thing
and
how
instructive
bossuet
would
say
the
ministers
fancied
that
they
were
dissolving
the
assembly
they
dissolved
the
government
the
soldiers
fired
on
the
army
and
killed
it
the
judges
fancied
that
they
were
trying
and
convicting
innocent
persons
they
tried
and
convicted
the
irremovable
magistracy
the
priests
thought
they
were
chanting
hosannahs
upon
louis
bonaparte
they
chanted
a
upon
the
clergy
vii
the
form
of
the
government
of
god
when
god
desires
to
destroy
a
thing
he
entrusts
its
destruction
to
the
thing
itself
every
bad
institution
of
this
world
ends
by
suicide
when
they
have
weighed
sufficiently
long
upon
men
providence
like
the
sultan
to
his
viziers
sends
them
the
bowstring
by
a
mute
and
they
execute
themselves
louis
bonaparte
is
the
mute
of
providence
conclusion
part
first
pettiness
of
the
master
abjectness
of
the
situation
i
never
fear
history
has
him
in
its
grip
if
perchance
it
flatters
the
of
bonaparte
to
be
seized
by
history
if
perchance
and
truly
one
would
imagine
so
he
cherishes
any
illusion
as
to
his
value
as
a
political
miscreant
let
him
divest
himself
of
it
let
him
not
imagine
because
he
has
piled
up
horror
on
horror
that
he
will
ever
raise
himself
to
the
elevation
of
the
great
historical
bandits
we
have
been
wrong
perhaps
in
some
pages
of
this
book
here
and
there
to
couple
him
with
those
men
no
although
he
has
committed
enormous
crimes
he
will
remain
paltry
he
will
never
be
other
than
the
nocturnal
strangler
of
liberty
he
will
never
be
other
than
the
man
who
intoxicated
his
soldiers
not
with
glory
like
the
first
napoleon
but
with
wine
he
will
never
be
other
than
the
pygmy
tyrant
of
a
great
people
grandeur
even
in
infamy
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
calibre
of
the
man
as
dictator
he
is
a
buffoon
let
him
make
himself
emperor
he
will
be
grotesque
that
will
finish
him
his
destiny
is
to
make
mankind
shrug
their
shoulders
will
he
be
less
severely
punished
for
that
reason
not
at
all
contempt
does
not
in
his
case
mitigate
anger
he
will
be
hideous
and
he
will
remain
ridiculous
that
is
all
history
laughs
and
crushes
even
the
most
indignant
chroniclers
will
not
help
him
there
great
thinkers
take
satisfaction
in
castigating
the
great
despots
and
in
some
instances
even
exalt
them
somewhat
in
order
to
make
them
worthy
of
their
rage
but
what
would
you
have
the
historian
do
with
this
fellow
the
historian
can
only
lead
him
to
posterity
by
the
ear
the
man
once
stripped
of
success
the
pedestal
removed
the
dust
fallen
the
tinsel
and
spangles
and
the
great
sabre
taken
away
the
poor
little
skeleton
laid
bare
and
shivering
can
one
imagine
anything
meaner
and
more
pitiful
history
has
its
tigers
the
historians
immortal
keepers
of
wild
beasts
exhibit
this
imperial
menagerie
to
the
nations
tacitus
alone
that
great
showman
captured
and
confined
eight
or
ten
of
these
tigers
in
the
iron
cage
of
his
style
look
at
them
they
are
terrifying
and
superb
their
spots
are
an
element
in
their
beauty
this
is
nimrod
the
hunter
of
men
this
busiris
the
tyrant
of
egypt
this
phalaris
who
baked
living
men
in
a
brazen
bull
to
make
the
bull
roar
this
ahasuerus
who
flayed
the
heads
of
the
seven
maccabees

had
them
roasted
alive
this

smeared

possesses
an
additional
claim
to
our
respect
in
the
horrible
fact
that
he
was
the
son
of

they
are
terrifying
hear

consider
them
one
after
the
other
the
historian
brings
them
to
you
the
historian
drags
them
raging
and
terrible
to
the
side
of
the
cage
opens
their
jaws
for
you
shows
you
their
teeth
and
their
claws
you
can
say
of
every
one
of
them
that
is
a
royal
tiger
in
fact
they
are
taken
from
all
the
thrones
of

history
parades
them
through

she
prevents
them
from
dying
she
takes
care
of

they
are
her
tigers
she
does
not
mingle
jackals
with
them
she
puts
and
keeps
apart
the
disgusting
beasts

he

of
a

of
a
knave
one

always
conscious
of
the
poor
prince
of
industry
who
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
in
england
his
present
prosperity
his
triumph
his

and
his
inflation
amount
to
nothing
the

over

down
at

napoleon
the
little
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
title
of
this
book
is
well
chosen
the
meanness
of
his
vices

the
grandeur
of
his
crimes
what
would
you
have
peter
the
cruel
massacred
but
he
did
not
steal
henry

assassinated
but
he
did
not
swindle
timour
crushed
children
under
horses
hoofs
much
as
bonaparte
exterminated
women
and
old
men
on
the
boulevard
but
he
did
not
lie
hear
the
arabian
historian
master
of
the
world
and
of
the
age
master
of
the
planetary
conjunctions
was
born
at
kesch
in
he
slaughtered
a
hundred
thousand
captives
as
he
was
besieging
siwas
the
inhabitants
to
mollify
him
sent
him
a
thousand
little
children
bearing
each
a
koran
on
its
head
and
crying
allah
he
caused
the
sacred
books
to
be
removed
with
respect
and
the
children
to
be
crushed
beneath
the
hoofs
of
wild
horses
he
used
seventy
thousand
human
heads
with
cement
stone
and
brick
in
building
towers
at
herat
sebzvar
tekrit
aleppo
and
bagdad
he
detested
lying
when
he
had
given
his
word
men
could
rely
upon
it
bonaparte
is
not
of
this
stature
he
has
not
that
dignity
which
the
great
despots
of
the
east
and
of
the
west
mingle
with
ferocity
the
amplitude
of
the
c√¶sars
is
wanting
in
him
to
bear
one
self
worthily
and
make
a
fair
appearance
among
all
the
illustrious
executioners
who
have
tortured
mankind
in
the
course
of
four
thousand
years
one
must
not
have
any
mental
hesitation
between
a
general
of
division
and

not

one
must
not
have
undergone
with
lowered
eyes
in
the
court
of
peers
the
haughty
scorn
of
magnan
one
must
not
have
been
called
pickpocket
by
the
english
newspapers
one
must
not
have
been
menaced
with
clichy
in
a
word
there
must
have
been
nothing
of
the
sneak
in
the
man
monsieur
louis
napoleon
you
are
ambitious
you
aim
high
but
you
must
have
the
truth
told
you
well
what
would
you
have
us
do
in
the
matter
in
vain
have
you
by
overturning
the
tribune
of
france
realized
after
your
fashion
the
wish
of
caligula
i
would
that
mankind
had
but
one
head
so
that
i
might
cut
it
off
with
a
blow
in
vain
have
you
banished
the
republicans
by
thousands
as
philip
iii
expelled
the
moors
and
as
torquemada
drove
out
the
jews
in
vain
have
you
dungeons
like
peter
the
cruel
hulks
like
hariadan
like
p√®re
letellier
and
like
ezzelino
iii
in
vain
have
you
perjured
yourself
like
ludovic
sforza
in
vain
have
you
massacred
and
assassinated
like
charles
ix
in
vain
have
you
done
all
this
in
vain
have
you
recalled
all
these
names
to
men
minds
when
they
think
of
your
name
you
are
nothing
but
a
rogue
a
man
is
not
a
monster
for
the
wishing
ii
from
every
agglomeration
of
men
from
every
city
from
every
nation
there
inevitably
arises
a
collective
force
place
this
collective
force
at
the
service
of
liberty
let
it
rule
by
universal
suffrage
the
city
becomes
a
commune
the
nation
becomes
a
republic
this
collective
force
is
not
of
its
nature
intelligent
belonging
to
all
it
belongs
to
no
one
it
floats
about
so
to
speak
outside
of
the
people
until
the
day
comes
when
according
to
the
true
social
formula
little
government
as
this
force
may
be
reduced
to
a
mere
street
and
road
police
paving
the
streets
lighting
the
lamps
and
looking
after
malefactors
until
that
day
comes
this
collective
force
being
at
the
mercy
of
many
chances
and
many
ambitions
needs
to
be
guarded
and
protected
by
jealous
institutions
it
may
be
subjugated
by
tradition
it
may
be
surprised
by
stratagem
a
man
may
rush
upon
it
seize
it
bridle
it
quell
it
and
cause
it
to
trample
upon
the
citizens
the
tyrant
is
the
man
who
born
of
tradition
like
nicholas
of
russia
or
of
stratagem
like
louis
bonaparte
seizes
for
his
own
profit
and
according
to
his
caprice
disposes
of
the
collective
force
of
a
people
this
man
if
he
be
by
birth
what
nicholas
is
is
the
enemy
of
society
if
he
have
done
what
louis
bonaparte
has
done
he
is
a
public
robber
the
former
has
no
account
to
settle
with
regular
legal
justice
with
the
articles
of
codes
he
has
behind
him
spying
upon
and
watching
him
hatred
in
their
hearts
and
vengeance
in
their
hands
orloff
in
his
palace
and
mouravieff
among
the
people
he
may
be
assassinated
by
one
of
his
army
or
poisoned
by
one
of
his
family
he
runs
the
risk
of
barrack
conspiracies
of
revolts
of
regiments
of
secret
military
societies
of
domestic
plots
of
sudden
mysterious
maladies
of
terrible
blows
of
great
catastrophes
the
other
ought
simply
to
go
to
poissy
the
former
has
the
wherewithal
to
die
in
the
purple
and
to
end
his
life
with
pomp
and
royally
as
monarchs
end
and
tragedies
the
other
must
live
live
between
four
walls
behind
bars
through
which
the
people
can
look
at
him
sweeping
courtyards
making
brushes
or
list
shoes
emptying
buckets
with
a
green
cap
on
his
head
wooden
shoes
on
his
feet
and
straw
in
his
shoes
ah
ye
leaders
of
the
old
parties
ye
men
of
absolutism
in
france
you
voted
among
outside
of
france
you
applauded
taking
this
cartouche
for
the
hero
of
order
he
is
ferocious
enough
for
it
i
admit
but
look
at
his
size
do
be
ungrateful
to
your
real
colossi
you
have
cashiered
your
haynaus
and
your
radetzkys
too
precipitately
above
all
weigh
this
comparison
which
so
naturally
presents
itself
to
the
mind
what
is
this
mandrin
of
lilliput
beside
nicholas
czar
emperor
and
pope
a
power
who
damns
and
condemns
drills
eight
hundred
thousand
soldiers
and
two
hundred
thousand
priests
holds
in
his
right
hand
the
keys
of
paradise
and
in
his
left
hand
the
keys
of
siberia
and
possesses
as
his
chattel
sixty
millions
of
men
their
souls
as
if
he
were
god
their
bodies
as
if
he
were
the
tomb
iii
if
there
should
not
be
ere
long
a
sudden
imposing
and
overwhelming
catastrophe
if
the
present
situation
of
the
nation
should
be
prolonged
and
endure
the
grand
injury
the
fearful
injury
would
be
the
moral
injury
the
boulevards
of
paris
the
streets
of
paris
the
rural
districts
and
the
towns
of
twenty
departments
of
france
were
strewn
on
the
of
december
with
dead

dying
citizens
there
were

before

thresholds
fathers

slaughtered
children
sabred
dishevelled

be
seen
at
this
moment

on

there
in

recess
for
three
days
after
the
victory
of

walked
in
ruddy
mire
a

full
of
human
brains
was
hung
on

tree
on

among

on
the
night
of

near

an
aged

stretched
on

pavement
his
bosom
pierced

ran

rue
tiquetonne
he
was
pale
his
head
rolled
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
while
they
were
taking
off
his
clothes
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
staring
and
as
i
leaned
over
his
mouth
it
seemed
that
i
could
still
hear
him
murmur
faintly
mother
well
there
is
something
more
than
murdered
child
more
lamentable
than
that
old
man
shot
dead
more
horrible
than
that
cap
full
of
human
brains
more
frightful
than
those
pavements
red
with
carnage
more
irreparable
than
those
men
and
women
those
fathers
and
those
mothers
stabbed
and
murdered
it
is
the
vanishing
honour
of
a
great
people
assuredly
those
pyramids
of
dead
bodies
which
one
saw
in
the
cemeteries
after
the
wagons
from
the
had
emptied
their
contents
those
immense
open
trenches
which
they
filled
in
the
morning
with
human
bodies
making
speed
because
of
the
increasing
light
of
day
all
this
was
frightful
but
what
is
still
more
frightful
is
to
think
that
at
this
hour
the
nations
are
in
doubt
and
that
in
their
eyes
france
that
great
moral
splendour
has
disappeared
that
which
is
more
than
skulls
cleft
by
the
sword
than
breasts
riddled
by
bullets
more
disastrous
than
houses
pillaged
than
murder
filling
the
streets
than
blood
shed
in
rivers
is
to
think
that
now
among
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
men
are
saying
to
one
another
do
you
know
that
that
nation
of
nations
that
people
of
the
of
july
that
people
of
the
of
august
that
people
of
that
people
of
that
race
of
giants
which
razed
bastiles
that
race
of
men
whose
faces
cast
a
bright
light
that
fatherland
of
the
human
race
which
produced
heroes
and
thinkers
those
heroes
who
made
all
the
revolutions
and
gave
birth
to
all
births
that
france
whose
name
meant
liberty
that
soul
of
the
world
so
to
say
which
shone
resplendent
in
europe
that
light
well
some
one
has
stepped
upon
it
and
put
it
out
there
is
no
longer
a
france
it
is
at
an
end
look
everywhere
darkness
the
world
is
feeling
its
way
ah
it
was
so
grand
where
are
those
times
those
glorious
times
interspersed
with
storms
but
glorious
when
all
was
life
when
all
was
liberty
when
all
was
glory
those
times
when
the
french
people
awake
before
all
others
and
up
before
the
light
their
brows
illumined
by
the
dawn
of
the
future
already
risen
for
them
said
to
the
other
nations
still
drowsy
and
overborne
and
scarcely
able
to
shake
their
chains
in
their
sleep
fear
naught
i
work
for
all
i
dig
the
earth
for
all
i
am
the
workman
of
the
almighty
what
profound
grief
regard
that
torpor
where
formerly
there
was
such
power
that
shame
where
formerly
there
was
such
pride
that
noble
people
whose
heads
were
once
held
erect
and
are
now
lowered
alas
louis
bonaparte
has
done
more
than
kill
persons
he
has
caused
men
minds
to
dwindle
he
has
withered
the
heart
of
the
citizen
one
must
belong
to
the
race
of
the
invincible
and
the
indomitable
to
persevere
now
in
the
rugged
path
of
renunciation
and
of
duty
an
indescribable
gangrene
of
material
prosperity
threatens
to
cause
public
honesty
to
degenerate
into
rottenness
oh
what
happiness
to
be
banished
to
be
disgraced
to
be
ruined
is
it
not
brave
workmen
is
it
not
worthy
peasants
driven
from
france
who
have
no
roof
to
shelter
you
and
no
shoes
to
your
feet
what
happiness
to
eat
black
bread
to
lie
on
a
mattress
thrown
on
the
ground
to
be
out
at
elbows
to
be
away
from
all
this
and
to
those
who
say
to
you
you
are
french
to
answer
i
am
proscribed
what
a
pitiful
thing
is
this
delight
of
and
cupidity
wallowing
in
the
slough
of
the
of
december
faith
let
us
live
let
us
go
into
business
let
us
speculate
in
zinc
and
railway
shares
let
us
make
money
it
is
degrading
but
it
is
an
excellent
thing
a
scruple
less
a
louis
more
let
us
sell
our
whole
soul
at
that
rate
one
runs
to
and
fro
one
rushes
about
one
cools
his
heels
in
anterooms
one
drinks
deep
of
every
kind
of
shame
and
if
one
can
not
get
a
concession
of
railways
in
france
or
of
lands
in
africa
one
asks
for
an
office
a
host
of
intrepid
devotions
besiege
the
elys√©e
and
collect
about
the
man
junot
beside
the
first
bonaparte
defied
the
splashing
of
shells
these
fellows
beside
the
second
defy
the
splashing
of
mud
what
care
they
about
sharing
his
ignominy
provided
they
share
his
fortune
the
competition
is
to
see
who
shall
carry
on
this
traffic
in
himself
most
cynically
and
among
these
creatures
there
are
young
men
with
pure
limpid
eyes
and
all
the
appearance
of
generous
youth
and
there
are
old
men
who
have
but
one
fear
which
is
that
the
office
solicited
may
not
reach
them
in
time
and
that
they
may
not
succeed
in
dishonouring
themselves
before
they
die
one
would
sell
himself
for
a
prefecture
another
for
a
collectorship
another
for
a
consulate
one
wants
a
tobacco
license
another
an
embassy
all
want
money
some
more
some
less
for
it
is
of
the
salary
they
think
not
of
the
duties
every
one
has
his
hand
out
all
offer
themselves
one
of
these
days
we
shall
have
to
appoint
an
assayer
of
consciences
at
the
mint
what
this
is
what
we
have
come
to
what
those
very
men
who
supported
the
those
very
men
who
recoiled
from
the
red
and
the
twaddle
about
jacquerie
in
those
very
men
to
whom
that
crime
seemed
a
good
thing
because
according
to
them
it
rescued
from
peril
their
consols
their
ledgers
their
their
even
they
do
not
comprehend
that
material
interest
surviving
alone
would
after
all
be
only
a
melancholy
waif
in
an
immense
moral
shipwreck
and
that
it
is
a
fearful
and
monstrous
situation
when
men
say
all
is
saved
save
honour
the
words
independence
enfranchisement
progress
popular
pride
national
pride
french
greatness
may
no
longer
be
pronounced
in
france
hush
these
words
make
too
much
noise
let
us
walk
on
tiptoe
and
speak
low
we
are
in
a
sick
man
chamber
who
is
this
man
he
is
the
chief
the
master
every
one
obeys
ah
every
one
respects
him
then
no
every
one
despises
oh
what
a
plight
and
military
honour
where
is
it
let
us
say
no
more
if
you
please
of
what
the
army
did
in
december
but
of
what
it
is
undergoing
at
this
moment
of
that
which
is
at
its
head
of
that
which
is
on
its
head
do
you
think
of
that
does
it
think
of
that
o
army
of
the
republic
army
that
had
for
captains
generals
paid
with
four
francs
a
day
army
that
had
for
leaders
carnot
austerity
marceau
unselfishness
hoche
honour
kl√©ber
devotion
joubert
probity
desaix
valour
bonaparte
genius
o
french
army
poor
unfortunate
heroic
army
gone
astray
in
the
train
of
these
men
what
will
they
do
with
it
whither
will
they
lead
it
how
will
they
occupy
it
what
parodies
are
we
destined
to
see
and
hear
alas
what
are
these
men
who
command
our
regiments
and
who
govern
us
the
master
we
know
him
this
fellow
who
had
been
a
minister
was
going
to
be
seized
on
the
of
december
it
was
for
that
reason
he
the
that
other
is
the
borrower
of
the
millions
from
the
bank
that
other
is
the
man
of
the
gold
ingots
to
that
other
before
he
was
made
minister
a
friend
said
say
you
are
humbugging
us
about
the
shares
in
that
affair
that
wo
go
down
with
me
if
there
any
swindling
going
on
let
me
at
least
have
a
finger
in
that
other
who
wears
epaulettes
has
just
been
convicted
of
selling
mortgaged
property
that
other
who
also
wears
epaulettes
received
on
the
morning
of
the
of
december
francs
for
emergencies
he
was
only
a
colonel
if
he
had
been
a
general
he
would
have
had
more
this
man
who
is
a
general
when
he
was
a
of
louis
xviii
being
on
duty
behind
the
chair
during
mass
cut
a
gold
tassel
from
the
throne
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
was
expelled
from
the
guards
for
that
surely
to
these
men
also
we
might
rear
a
column
aere
with
the
money
they
stole
this
other
who
is
a
general
of
division
converted
francs
to
the
knowledge
of
colonel
caharras
in
the
construction
of
the
villages
of
saint
andr√©
and
saint
hippolyte
near
mascara
this
one
who
is
was
christened
at
ghent
where
he
is
known
g√©n√©ral
this
one
who
is
minister
of
war
has
only
general
rulhi√®re
clemency
to
thank
that
he
was
not
sent
before
a
such
are
the
men
no
matter
forward
beat
drums
sound
trumpets
wave
flags
soldiers
from
the
top
of
yon
pyramids
the
forty
thieves
look
down
upon
you
let
us
go
farther
into
this
mournful
subject
and
survey
it
in
all
its
aspects
the
mere
spectacle
of
fortune
like
that
of
bonaparte
placed
at
the
head
of
the
state
would
suffice
to
demoralize
a
people
there
is
always
and
it
is
the
fault
of
our
social
institutions
that
ought
above
all
to
enlighten
and
civilize
there
is
always
in
a
large
population
like
that
of
france
a
class
which
is
ignorant
which
suffers
covets
and
struggles
placed
between
the
brutish
instinct
which
impels
it
to
take
and
the
moral
law
which
invites
it
to
labour
in
the
grievous
and
oppressed
condition
in
which
it
still
is
this
class
in
order
to
maintain
itself
in
probity
and
requires
all
the
pure
and
holy
light
that
emanates
from
the
gospel
it
requires
that
on
the
one
hand
the
spirit
of
jesus
christ
and
on
the
other
the
spirit
of
the
french
revolution
should
address
to
it
the
same
manly
words
and
should
never
cease
to
point
out
to
it
as
the
only
lights
worthy
of
the
eyes
of
man
the
exalted
and
mysterious
laws
of
human
destiny
devotion
sacrifice
the
labour
which
leads
to
material
the
probity
which
leads
to
inward
even
with
this
perennial
instruction
at
once
divine
and
human
this
class
so
worthy
of
sympathy
and
fraternity
often
succumbs
suffering
and
temptation
are
stronger
than
virtue
now
do
you
comprehend
the
infamous
counsel
which
the
success
of
bonaparte
gives
to
this
class
a
poor
man
in
rags
without
money
without
work
is
there
in
the
shadow
at
the
corner
of
the
street
seated
on
a
stone
he
is
meditating
and
at
the
same
time
repelling
a
bad
action
now
he
wavers
now
he
recovers
himself
he
is
starving
and
feels
a
desire
to
rob
to
rob
he
must
make
a
false
key
he
must
scale
a
wall
then
the
key
made
and
the
wall
scaled
he
will
stand
before
the
strong
box
if
any
one
wakes
if
any
one
resists
he
must
kill
his
hair
stands
on
end
his
eyes
become
haggard
his
conscience
the
voice
of
god
revolts
within
him
and
cries
to
him
stop
this
is
evil
these
are
crimes
at
that
moment
the
head
of
the
state
passes
by
the
man
sees
bonaparte
in
his
uniform
of
a
general
with
the
and
with
footmen
in
liveries
dashing
towards
his
palace
in
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
the
unhappy
wretch
hesitating
before
his
crime
greedily
gazes
on
this
splendid
vision
and
the
serenity
of
bonaparte
and
his
gold
epaulettes
and
his
and
the
liveries
and
the
palace
and
the
carriage
say
to
him
succeed
he
attaches
himself
to
this
apparition
he
follows
it
he
runs
to
the
√©lys√©e
a
gilded
mob
rushes
in
after
the
prince
all
sorts
of
carriages
pass
under
that
portal
and
he
has
glimpses
of
happy
radiant
men
this
one
is
an
ambassador
the
ambassador
looks
at
him
and
says
succeed
this
is
a
bishop
the
bishop
looks
at
him
and
says
succeed
this
is
a
judge
the
judge
looks
at
him
and
smiles
on
him
and
says
succeed
thus
to
escape
the
gendarmes
therein
consists
henceforth
the
whole
moral
law
to
rob
to
pillage
to
poignard
to
assassinate
all
this
is
criminal
only
when
one
is
fool
enough
to
allow
himself
to
be
caught
every
man
who
meditates
a
crime
has
a
constitution
to
violate
an
oath
to
break
an
obstacle
to
destroy
in
a
word
take
your
measures
well
be
adroit
succeed
the
only
guilty
actions
are
the
that
fail
you
put
your
hand
in
the
pocket
of
a
in
the
evening
at
nightfall
in
a
lonely
place
he
seizes
you
you
let
go
he
arrests
you
and
takes
you
to
the
you
are
guilty
to
the
galleys
you
do
not
let
go
you
have
a
knife
about
you
you
bury
it
in
the
throat
he
falls
he
is
dead
now
take
his
purse
and
make
off
bravo
capitally
done
you
have
shut
the
victim
mouth
the
only
witness
who
could
speak
nobody
has
anything
to
say
to
you
if
you
had
only
robbed
the
man
you
would
have
been
in
the
wrong
kill
him
and
you
are
right
succeed
that
is
the
point
ah
this
is
indeed
alarming
on
the
day
when
the
human
conscience
shall
lose
its
bearings
on
the
day
when
success
shall
carry
the
day
before
that
forum
all
will
be
at
an
end
the
last
moral
gleam
will
reascend
to
heaven
darkness
will
be
in
the
mind
of
man
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
devour
one
another
wild
beasts
that
you
are
with
moral
degradation
goes
political
degradation
bonaparte
treats
the
people
of
france
like
a
conquered
country
he
effaces
the
republican
inscriptions
he
cut
down
the
trees
of
liberty
and
makes
firewood
of
them
there
was
on
place
bourgogne
a
statue
of
the
republic
he
puts
the
pickaxe
to
it
there
was
on
our
coinage
a
figure
of
the
republic
crowned
with
ears
of
corn
bonaparte
replaces
it
by
the
profile
of
bonaparte
he
has
his
bust
crowned
and
harangued
in
the
just
as
the
tyrant
gessler
made
the
people
salute
his
cap
the
rustics
in
the
faubourgs
were
in
the
habit
of
singing
in
chorus
in
the
evening
as
they
returned
from
work
they
used
to
sing
the
great
republican
songs
the
marseillaise
the
chant
du
depart
they
were
ordered
to
keep
silent
the
faubourgers
will
sing
no
more
there
is
amnesty
only
for
obscenities
and
drunken
songs
the
triumph
is
so
complete
that
they
no
longer
keep
within
bounds
only
yesterday
they
kept
in
hiding
they
did
their
shooting
at
night
it
was
shocking
but
there
was
still
some
shame
there
was
a
remnant
of
respect
for
the
people
they
seemed
to
think
that
it
had
still
enough
life
in
it
to
revolt
if
it
saw
such
things
now
they
show
themselves
they
fear
nothing
they
guillotine
in
broad
day
whom
do
they
guillotine
whom
the
men
of
the
law
and
the
law
is
there
whom
the
men
of
the
people
and
the
people
is
there
nor
is
this
all
there
is
a
man
in
europe
who
horrifies
europe
that
man
sacked
lombardy
he
set
up
the
gibbets
of
hungary
he
had
a
woman
whipped
under
the
gibbet
upon
which
hung
her
husband
and
her
son
we
still
remember
the
terrible
letter
in
which
that
woman
recounts
the
deed
and
says
my
heart
has
turned
to
stone
last
year
this
man
took
it
into
his
head
to
visit
england
as
a
tourist
and
while
in
london
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
visit
a
brewery
that
of
barclay
and
perkins
there
he
was
recognized
a
voice
whispered
it
is
haynau
it
is
haynau
repeated
the
workmen
it
was
a
fearful
cry
the
crowd
rushed
upon
the
wretch
tore
out
his
infamous
white
hair
by
handfuls
spat
in
his
face
and
thrust
him
out
well
this
old
bandit
in
epaulettes
this
haynau
this
man
who
still
bears
on
his
cheek
the
immense
buffet

will
be
there

see
haynau

cursed
and
hooted
at
the
brewery
of
barclay
and
perkins
he
will
receive
bouquets
at
the
brewery
of
the
faubourg
will
receive
an
order
to
conduct
itself
properly
the
faubourg
mute
motionless
impassive
will
see
them
pass
triumphant
and
conversing
together
like
two
friends
through
its
old
revolutionary
streets
one
in
french
the
other
in
austrian

louis

of
the

go
on
add
insult
to

disfigure
this
france
of
ours
fallen
flat
on
the

make
her
unrecognizable
crush
the
faces
of
the

with
your

oh
inspire
me
seek
for
me
give
me
invent
for
me
a
means
whatever
it
may
be
short
of
a
poignard
which
i
repudiate
a
brutus
for
that
man
bah
he
is
not
worthy
of
even
a
louvel
find
me
some
means
of
laying
that
man
low
and
of
delivering
my
country
of
laying

that
man
of

that

that
man
of

that

some

by
the

yes
whatever
it
be
so
it
be
honourable
and
in
open
day
i
take
it
we
all
take
it
we
proscribed
if
it
can
liberty
set
free
the
republic
deliver
our
country
from
shame
and
drive
back
to
his
dust
to
his
oblivion
to
his
cloaca
this
imperial
ruffian
this
prince
this
gypsy
king
this
traitor
this
master
this
groom
of
franconi
this
radiant
imperturbable
governor
crowned
with
his
successful
crime
who
goes
and
comes
and
peacefully
parades
trembling
paris
and
who
has
everything
on
his
side
the
bourse
the
shopkeepers
the
magistracy
all
influences
all
guarantees
all
invocations
from
the
de
of
the
soldier
to
the
te
deum
of
the
priest
really
when
one
has
fixed
one
eyes
too
long
on
certain
aspects
of
this
spectacle
even
the
strongest
minds
are
attacked
with
vertigo
but
does
he
at
least
do
himself
justice
this
bonaparte
has
he
a
glimmering
an
idea
a
suspicion
the
slightest
perception
of
his
infamy
really
one
is
driven
to
doubt
it
yes
sometimes
from
the
lofty
words
he
uses
when
one
hears
him
make
incredible
appeals
to
posterity
to
that
posterity
which
will
shudder
with
horror
and
wrath
at
him
when
one
hears
him
speak
coolly
of
his
legitimacy
and
his
mission
one
is
almost
tempted
to
think
that
he
has
come
to
take
himself
into
high
consideration
and
that
his
head
is
turned
to
such
a
degree
that
he
no
longer
perceives
what
he
is
nor
what
he
does
he
believes
in
the
adhesion
of
the
poor
he
believes
in
the
of
kings
he
believes
in
the
f√™te
of
eagles
he
believes
in
the
harangues
of
the
council
of
state
he
believes
in
the
benedictions
of
the
bishops
he
believes
in
the
oath
that
he
has
forced
people
to
take
he
believes
in
the
votes
he
is
talking
now
feeling
in
the
humour
of
augustus
of
granting
amnesty
to
the
proscribed
usurpation
granting
amnesty
to
right
treason
to
honour
cowardice
to
courage
crime
to
virtue
he
is
to
that
degree
embruted
by
his
success
that
he
thinks
this
all
very
simple
singular
effect
of
intoxication
optical
illusion
in
his
eyes
that
thing
of
the
of
january
appears
all
golden
and
glorious
and
radiant
that
constitution
defiled
with
mud
stained
with
blood
laden
with
chains
dragged
amid
the
hooting
of

by
the

all

men
things

by
the
single
fact
of
universal
life
to
cause
the
disappearance
of
an
old
world
it
is
sufficient
that
civilization
ascending
majestically
towards
its
solstice
should
shine
upon
old
institutions
upon
old

upon
old

and
upon

this

at

it
consumes
this
is
the
mysterious
fact

this

in
some

a

decrepitude

little
the
ruin
progresses
deep

which
are

ramify
in
the
darkness
and
internally
reduce
to
powder
the
venerable
structure
which
still
appears
a
solid
mass
without
and
suddenly
some
fine
day
this
ancient
of
things
of
which
decaying
societies
are
composed
becomes
shapeless
the
nails
come
out
the
structure
becomes
disjointed
and
overhangs
then
it
no
longer
has
any
solidity
let
one
of
those
giants
peculiar
to
revolutions
appear
let
him
raise
his
hand
and
all
is
said
there
was
a
moment
in
history
when
a
nudge
of
danton
elbow
would
have
shaken
all
europe
to
its
foundations
the
year
was
such
a
moment
ancient
europe
feudal
papal
and
monarchical
replastered
so
disastrously
for
france
in
tottered
but
there
was
no
danton
the
crash
did
not
take
place
it
has
often
been
said
in
the
commonplace
phraseology
used
on
similar
occasions
that
opened
a
gulf
not
at
all
the
corpse
of
the
past
lay
upon
europe
it
lies
there
still
at
this
moment
the
year
opened
a
grave
wherein
to
throw
that
corpse
it
is
this
grave
that
has
been
taken
for
a
gulf
in
all
that
still
held
to
the
past
all
that
still
survived
of
the
body
had
a
close
view
of
this
grave
not
only
the
kings
upon
their
thrones
the
cardinals
under
their
hats
the
judges
in
the
shadow
of
their
guillotines
the

thrown
into
commotion
but
he
who
had
any
interest
whatever
in
what
was
about
to
disappear
he
who
was
cultivating
for
his
own
profit
a
social
fiction
and
had
an
abuse
to
let
out
on
hire
he
who
was
guardian
of
some
falsehood
doorkeeper
of
some
prejudice
or
farmer
of
some
superstition
he
who
was
taking
advantage
of
another
or
dealing
in
usury
oppression
and
falsehood
he
who
sold
by
false
weights
from
those
who
falsify

to
those
who
falsify
the

from
the
cheating

more
or

catholic
to
the
bishop
who
becomes
more
or
less
of

jew
all
the
men
of
the
past
inclined
their
heads
towards
one
another
and
trembled
this
grave
which
was
gaping
and
into
which
had
nearly
fallen
all
the
fictions
their
treasure
which
have
weighed
upon
men
for
so
many
ages
they
resolved
to
fill
up
they
determined
to
wall
it
up
to
pile
rocks
and
stones
upon
it
and
to
erect
upon
the
pile
a
gibbet
and
to
hang
upon
this
gibbet
all
bleeding
and
dejected
that
mighty
culprit
truth
they
determined
once
for
all
to
make
an
end
of
the
spirit
of
freedom
and
emancipation
and
to
drive
back
and
repress
for
ever
the
upward
tendency
of
mankind
the
enterprise
was
formidable
what
the
nature
of
it
was
we
have
already
indicated
more
than
once
in
this
book
and
elsewhere
to
undo
the
labour
of
twenty
generations
to
kill
in
the
nineteenth
century
by
strangulation
three
centuries
the
sixteenth
the
seventeenth
and
the
eighteenth
that
is
to
say
luther
descartes
and
voltaire
religious
scrutiny
philosophical
scrutiny
universal
scrutiny
to
crush
throughout
all
europe
this
immense
vegetation
of

there
a
sturdy

marry
the

and
the
to
put
more
of
spain
in
the
south
and
more
of
russia
in
the
north
to
resuscitate
all
they
could
of
the
inquisition
and
to
stifle
all
they
could
of
intelligence
to
stultify
youth
in
other
words
to
brutalize
the
future
to
make
the
world
a
witness
of
the
of
ideas
to
throw
down
the
tribune
to
suppress
the
newspaper
the
placard
the
book
the
spoken
word
the
cry
the
whisper
the
breath
to
make
silence
to
pursue

into
the

of
the

pack
to
hold
out
to
each
man
for

for

for
aim
in

and
for
god
his
selfish
interest
to
say
to
nations
eat
and

no
more
to
take
man
from
the

and
put
him
in
the
belly
to
extinguish
individual
initiative
local

national
impulse
all
those
instincts
which
impel
man
to
that
which
is
right
to
annihilate
that
of

which
is
called
the
fatherland
to
destroy
nationality
among
partitioned

dismembered
peoples
constitutions
in
constitutional
states
the

in

and
liberty
everywhere
to
plant
the
foot
everywhere
upon
human
effort
in
one
word
to
close
that
abyss
which
is
called
progress
such
was
the
plan
vast
enormous
european
which
no
one
conceived
for
not
one
of
those
men
of
the
old
world
had
had
genius
for
it
but
which
all
followed
as
for
the
plan
in
itself
as
for
that
idea
of
universal
repression
whence
came
it
who
could
tell
it
was
seen
in
the
air
it
appeared
in
the
past
it
enlightened
certain
souls
it
pointed
to
certain
routes
it
was
a
gleam
issuing
from
the
tomb
of
machiavelii
at
certain
moments
of
human
history
from
the
things
which
are
plotted
and
the
things
which
are
done
it
would
seem
that
all
the
old
demons
of
humanity
louis

catherine

the

of
alva
torquemada
are
somewhere
or
other
in
a
corner
seated
around
a
table
and
taking
counsel
together
we
look
we
search
and
instead
of
the
colossi
we
find
abortions
where
we
expected
to
see
the
duke
of
alva
we
find
schwartzenberg
where
we
expected
to
see

we
find
veuillot
the
old
european
despotism
continues
its
march
with
these
little
men
and
goes
on
and
on
it
resembles
the
czar
peter
when
travelling
relay
with
what
we
can
find
he
wrote
we
had
no
more
tartar
horses
we
took
donkeys
to
attain
this
object
the
repression
of
everything
and
everybody
it
was
necessary
to
pursue
an
obscure
tortuous
rugged
difficult
path
they
pursued
it
some
of
those
who
entered
it
knew
what
they
were
doing
parties
are
kept
alive
by
watchwords
those
men
those
ringleaders
whom
frightened
and
assembled
had
as
we
have
said
above
adopted
theirs
religion
family
property
with
that
commonplace
adroitness
which
suffices
when
one
speaks
to
fear
they
exploited
certain
obscure
aspects
of
what
was
called
socialism
it
was
a
question
of
saving
religion
property
and
the
family
save
the
flag
they
exclaimed
the
vulgar
herd
of
terrified
selfish
interests
threw
themselves
into
the
current
they
coalesced
they
made
a
stand
they
formed
in
mass
they
had
a
crowd
around
them
this
crowd
was
composed
of
diverse
elements
the
landed
proprietor
entered
it
because
his
rents
had
fallen
the
peasant
because
he
had
paid
the
centimes
he
who
did
not
believe
in
god
thought
it
necessary
to
save
religion
because
he
had
been
forced
to
sell
his
horses
they
extracted
from
this
crowd
the
force
it
contained
and
made
use
of
it
they
made
everything
contribute
to
repression
the
law
despotism
the
assemblies
the
tribune
the
jury
the
magistracy
the
police
in
lombardy
the
sabre
at
naples
the
convict
prison
in
hungary
the
gibbet
to
remuzzle
men
intellects
to
replace
the
fetters
on
men
minds
these
runaway
slaves
to
prevent
the
past
from
disappearing
to
prevent
the
future
from
being
born
to
remain
kings
powerful
privileged
and
happy
all
means
were
good
all
just
all
legitimate
for
the
exigencies
of
the
struggle
they
manufactured
and
spread
throughout
the
world
a
sort
of
against
liberty
which
ferdinand
put
in
action
at
palermo
antonelli
at
rome
schwartzenberg
at
milan
and
at
pesth
and
later
at
paris
those
wolves
of

the
men
of
december
there
was
a
nation
among
the
nations
which
was
a
sort
of
elder
brother
in
this
family
of
the
oppressed
a
prophet
in
the
human
tribe
this
nation
took
the
initiative
of
the
whole
human
movement
it
went
on
saying
come
and
the
rest
followed
as
a
complement
to
the
fraternity
of
men
in
the
gospel
it
taught
the
fraternity
of
nations
it
spoke
by
the
voice
of
its
writers
of
its
poets
of
its
philosophers
of
its
orators
as
by
a
single
mouth
and
its
words
flew
to
the
extremities
of
the
earth
to
rest
like
tongues
of
fire
upon
the
brow
of
all
nations
it
presided
over
the
communion
of
intellects
it
multiplied
the
bread
of
life
to
those
who
were
wandering
in
the
desert
one
day
it
was
enveloped
in
a
tempest
it
marched
over
the
abyss
and
said
to
the
frightened
nations
why
are
you
afraid
the
wave
of
the
revolutions
it
had
excited
subsided
under
its
footsteps
and
far
from
engulfing
it
increased
its
glory
the
suffering
infirm
and
diseased
nations
pressed
around
it
one

of

centuries

another
was

the
old
roman
papistry
had
filled
its
eyes
with
mist
and
darkness
to
this
one
it
said
receive
thy
sight
it
opened
its
eyes
and
saw
throw
away
your
crutches
that
is
to
say
your
prejudices
it
said

your
bandages
that
is
to

a
grateful
clamour
arose
among
the
nations
which
these
words
made
sound
and
strong
one
day
it
accosted
dead
poland
it
raised
its
finger
and
exclaimed

dead

arose

of
the
past
whose
fall
it
announced
dreaded
and
hated
by
dint
of
stratagem
of
tortuous
patience
and
of
audacity
they
ended
by
seizing
it
and
succeeded
in
throttling
it
for
three
years
and
more
the
world
has
witnessed
a
tremendous
agony
and
a
frightful
spectacle
for
three

while
we
await
this
final

let
us
consider
the
point
to
which
this
age
had
brought
civilization
formerly
there
was
a
world
in
which
people
walked
slowly
with
bent
back
and
eyes
cast
down
in
which
the
comte
de
gouvon
was
served
at
table
by
in
which
the
chevalier
de
rohan
belaboured
voltaire
with
a
stick
in
which
daniel
defoe
was
placed
in
the
pillory
in
which
a
city
like
dijon
was
separated
from
a
city
like
paris
by
the
necessity
of
making
one
will
by
robbers
at
every
corner
and
ten
days
by
stage
in
which
a
book
was
a
sort
of
infamy
and
filth
which
the
hangman
burned
upon
the
steps
of
the
palais
de
justice
in
which
superstition
and
ferocity
shook
hands
in
which
the
pope
said
to
the
emperor
dexteras
gladium
gladio
in
which
one
met
at
every
step
crosses
hung
with
amulets
and
gibbets
hung
with
men
in
which
there
were
heretics
jews
and
lepers
in
which
houses
had
battlements
and
in
which
streets
were
closed
with
a
chain
rivers
with
a
chain
and
even
camps
with
a
chain
as
at
the
battle
of
tolosa
cities
with
walls
kingdoms
with
prohibitions
and
penalties
in
which
with
the
exception
of
force
and
authority
which
stuck
tightly
together
everything
was
penned
up
distributed
divided
cut
into
fragments
hated
and
hating
scattered
and
dead
men
were
as
dust
power
a
solid
block
but
now
we
have
a
world
in
which
everything
is
alive
united
combined
coupled
mingled
together
a
world
in
which
thought
commerce
and
industry
reign
in
which
politics
more
and
more
firmly
fixed
tends
to
an
intimate
union
with
science
a
world
in
which
the
last
scaffolds
and
the
last
cannon
are
hastening
to
cut
off
their
last
heads
and
to
vomit
forth
their
last
shells
a
world
in
which
light
increases
every
instant
a
world
in
which
distance
has
disappeared
in
which
constantinople
is
nearer
to
paris
than
lyons
was
a
hundred
years
ago
in
which
europe
and
america
pulsate
with
the
same
a
world
all
circulation
and
all
love
of
which
france
is
the
brain
the
railroads
the
arteries
and
the
electric
wires
the
fibres
do
you
not
see
that
simply
to
set
forth
such
a
state
of
affairs
is
to
explain
to
demonstrate
and
to
solve
everything
do
you
not
feel
that
the
old
world
had
an
aged
soul
tyranny
and
that
into
the
new
world
is
about
to
descend
necessarily
irresistibly
and
divinely
a
youthful
soul
liberty
this
was
the
work
that
the
nineteenth
century
had
done
among
men
and
was
continuing
in
glorious
fashion
to
do
that
century
of
sterility
that
century
of
domination
that
century
of
decadence
that
century
of
degradation
as
it
is
called
by
the
pedants
the
rhetoricians
the
imbeciles
and
all
that
filthy
brood
of
bigots
of
knaves
and
of
sharpers
who
sanctimoniously
slaver
gall
upon
glory
who
assert
that
pascal
was
a
madman
voltaire
a
coxcomb
and
rousseau
a
brute
and
whose
triumph
it
would
be
to
put
a
upon
the
human
race

yes
the
enfranchisement
of

and
the
consequent
enfranchisement
of

this
was
the
sublime
task
that
the
nineteenth

was
performing

with

the

the

imprinted
upon
your

naked
and
ashamed
and
like
a

deprived
of

an
object
of
hatred
of
derision
alas
it
is
at
this
moment
my
country
that
the
heart
of
the

overflows
with
love

respect
for

lie
there
motionless

deeply
fixed
in
the
heart
as
when
one
is
torn
from
it
by
exile
they
will
do
their
whole
duty
with
a
tranquil
brow
and
unshaken
perseverance
never
to
see
thee
again
is
their
sorrow
never
to
forget
thee
their
joy
ah
what
grief
and
after
eight
months
it
is
in
vain
that
we
say
to
ourselves
that
these
things
are
so
it
is
in
vain
that
we
look
around
us
and
see
the
spire
of
instead
of
the
pantheon
and
instead
of
we
can
not
believe
it
it
is
however
true
it
can
not
be
denied
we
must
admit
it
we
must
acknowledge
it
even
though
we
expire
of
humiliation
and
despair
that
which
is
lying
there
on
the
ground
is
the
nineteenth
century
is
france
and
it
is
this
bonaparte
who
has
caused
all
this
ruin
and
it
is
in
the
very
centre
of
the
greatest
nation
upon
earth
it
is
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
century
of
all
history
that
this
man
has
suddenly
risen
and
has
triumphed
to
seize
upon
france
as
his
prey
great
heaven
what
the
lion
would
not
dare
to
do
the
ape
has
done
what
the
eagle
would
have
dreaded
to
seize
in
his
talons
the
parrot
has
taken
in
his
claws
what
louis
xi
failed
richelieu
destroyed
himself
in
the
attempt
even
napoleon
was
unequal
to
it
in
a
single
day
between
night
and
morning
the
absurd
became
the
possible
all
that
was
axiomatic
has
become
chimerical
all
that
was
false
has
become
living
fact
what
the
most
brilliant
concourse
of
men
the
most
magnificent
movements
of
ideas
the
most
formidable
sequence
of
events
a
thing
that
no
titian
could
have
controlled
that
no
hercules
could
have
turned
aside
the
human
flood
in
full
course
the
french
wave
sweeping
onward
civilization
progress
intelligence
revolution
liberty
he
stopped
it
all
one
fine
morning
stopped
it
short
he
this
mask
this
dwarf
this
aborted
tiberius
this
nothing
god
was
advancing
louis
bonaparte
his
plume
on
his
head
blocked
his
path
and
said
to
god
thou
shalt
go
no
farther
god
halted
and
you
fancy
that
this
is
so
and
you
imagine
that
this
plebiscite
exists
that
this
constitution
of
some
day
or
other
in
january
exists
that
this
senate
exists
that
this
council
of
state
and
this
corps
l√©gislatif
exist
you
fancy
that
there
is
a
lackey
who
is
called
rouher
a
valet
who
is
called
troplong
a
eunuch
who
is
called
baroche
and
a
sultan
a
pacha
a
master
who
is
called
louis
bonaparte
you
do
not
see
then
that
all
this
is
a
chimera
you
do
not
see
that
the
of
december
is
nothing
but
an
immense
illusion
a
pause
a
a
sort
of
behind
which
god
that
marvellous
is
preparing
and
constructing
the
last
act
the
supreme
triumphal
act
of
the
french
revolution
you
gaze
stupidly
at
the
curtain
at
the
things
painted
on
the
coarse
canvas
this
nose
that
one
epaulettes
the
great
sabre
of
a
third
those
belaced
venders
of
de
whom
you
call
generals
those
whom
you
call
magistrates
those
worthy
men
whom
you
call
senators
this
mixture
of
caricatures
and
spectres
and
you
take
them
all
for
realities
and
you
do
not
hear
beyond
them
in
the
shadow
that
hollow
sound
you
do
not
hear
some
one
going
and
coming
you
do
not
see
that
curtain
quiver
in
the
breath
of
him
who
is
behind
the
end
