chapter
i
off
to
something
unusual
was
happening
at
locust
although
it
was
early
in
september
and
the
heat
and
dust
of
a
kentucky
summer
still
lingered
in
every
corner
of
lloydsboro
valley
the
great
house
with
its
pillars
was
being
hastily
put
in
order
for
winter
closing
rob
moore
swinging
his
tennis
racket
as
he
sauntered
down
the
avenue
under
the
arching
stopped
short
with
a
whistle
of
surprise
the
tennis
net
was
down
he
had
come
at
the
little
invitation
for
a
farewell
game
as
they
were
both
to
start
to
school
on
the
morrow
she
in
the
valley
and
he
in
town
he
could
not
understand
the
sudden
removal
of
the
net
then
he
noticed
that
every
hammock
and
had
disappeared
from
the
lawn
not
even
the
usual
trail
of
magazines
and
fans
was
left
on
the
grass
to
show
that
somebody
had
been
spending
a
comfortable
hour
in
the
shade
usually
at
this
time
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
flutter
of
ribbons
and
white
dresses
somewhere
back
among
the
trees
but
the
place
was
deserted
now
the
wicker
was
gone
from
its
corner
on
the
piazza
the
rugs
and
cushions
which
had
filled
the
cosy
corners
behind
the
vines
were
packed
away
the
lace
curtains
were
down
in
the
long
and
peering
through
the
windows
which
opened
to
the
floor
he
saw
a
coloured
man
busily
shrouding
the
handsome
old
furniture
in
linen
covers
what
the
matter
alec
asked
rob
what
has
become
of
everybody
done
had
bad
news
from
ole
colonel
las
night
answered
the
man
walkah
telegraphed
from
hot
springs
that
ole
marse
rheumatiz
is
wuss
and
mis
sherman
she
gwine
down
to
stay
with
him
awhile
an
the
young
ladies
is
gwine
to
we
all
fixin
to
shet
up
the
place
till
rob
gave
another
long
whistle
shrill
and
loud
he
exclaimed
well
this
is
the
biggest
surprise
out
his
whistle
was
answered
from
the
upper
hall
by
a
clear
high
trill
which
had
been
the
little
colonel
signal
for
him
since
the
first
summer
they
had
played
together
giving
the
answering
call
he
stepped
inside
the
hall
and
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
peered
up
anxiously
at
the
laughing
face
leaning
over
the
above
him
come
down
lloyd
and
tell
me
all
about
it
he
demanded
i
ca
now
she
replied
in
an
important
tone
smiling
tantalizingly
at
the
tall
boy
who
shook
his
racket
at
her
with
a
threatening
gesture
mothah
has
gone
to
town
and
mom
beck
is
packing
my
trunk
i
have
to
show
her
what
things
to
put
into
it
betty
is
down
there
somewhere
she
take
the
edge
off
yoah
curiosity
betty
she
called
catching
sight
of
a
pink
dress
whisking
through
the
lower
hall
do
tell
rob
what
school
we
are
going
to
make
him
guess
all
right
answered
betty
with
a
mischievous
light
in
her
brown
eyes
as
she
tossed
back
her
curls
and
led
the
way
out
to
the
stone
steps
we
have
to
sit
out
here
all
the
hammocks
and
are
packed
away
in
the
attic
she
explained
as
she
spread
out
the
pink
skirt
and
leaned
comfortably
back
against
one
of
the
white
pillars
seems
to
me
you
been
in
a
howling
hurry
with
your
planning
and
your
packing
said
rob
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
did
hear
a
whisper
of
all
this
when
i
was
here
yesterday
evening
the
telegram
did
come
until
after
you
had
gone
answered
betty
but
i
think
godmother
must
have
been
expecting
it
for
in
half
an
hour
her
plans
were
all
made
and
the
packing
began
early
this
morning
as
papa
jack
business
will
keep
him
away
nearly
all
fall
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
close
the
house
and
send
lloyd
and
me
to
you
ca
imagine
how
busy
we
been
we
are
to
leave
morning
so
are
we
answered
rob
oaklea
looks
nearly
as
deserted
as
locust
i
always
hate
this
time
at
the
end
of
every
summer
as
he
spoke
a
delicious
odour
of
hot
gingerbread
was
wafted
around
the
corner
of
the
house
from
the
distant
kitchen
and
he
stopped
to
look
at
betty
and
smile
what
does
that
make
you
think
of
he
asked
of
a
lovely
september
afternoon
just
like
this
answered
betty
dreamily
her
eyes
and
drawing
in
the
fragrance
with
a
slow
deep
breath
of
long
shadows
on
the
lawn
and
the
sunshine
flickering
down
through
the
locust
leaves
like
gold
just
as
it
is
doing
now
of
malcolm
macintyre
sitting
over
where
you
are
thrumming
on
his
banjo
and
of
keith
and
you
and
lloyd
and
me
all
singing
old
kentucky
home
is
that
what
it
makes
you
think
of
yes
that
and
the
chase
we
gave
old
aunt
cindy
was
she
mad
when
i
made
off
with
that
gingerbread
i
can
hear
her
old
slipper
soles
yet
flopping
down
the
path
after
me
how
long
ago
that
seems
mused
betty
and
yet
it
only
two
years
it
surely
must
be
longer
than
that
exclaimed
rob
no
do
you
remember
it
was
just
after
lloyd
house
party
when
she
was
eleven
and
i
was
twelve
i
went
abroad
that
fall
with
cousin
carl
and
eugenia
and
stayed
with
them
a
year
and
i
only
been
living
at
locust
a
year
now
i
a
little
over
fourteen
and
lloyd
thirteen
so
that
just
makes
it
thirteen
yeahs
and
foah
months
exactly
if
you
talking
about
me
said
the
little
colonel
coming
out
on
the
porch
with
a
plate
in
her
hands
i
smelled
the
gingahbread
so
i
told
mom
beck
i
have
to
stop
for
refreshments
and
she
could
finish
packing
by
herself
i
piled
everything
on
the
bed
that
i
thought
i
could
possibly
need
at
and
that
neahly
everything
i
own
one
needs
so
many
things
going
off
from
home
this
way
have
some
she
passed
the
plate
to
each
one
and
then
sitting
down
on
the
top
step
beside
it
helped
herself
to
a
slice
of
the
hot
spicy
cake
oh
rob
we
going
to
have
larks
she
began
i
always
wanted
to
go
away
to
school
and
have
midnight
suppahs
and
do
the
things
you
read
about
in
stories
i
heard
mothah
talk
about
the
funny
things
that
happened
at
the
seminary
when
she
was
a
girl
till
i
was
simply
wild
to
go
there
too
and
now
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
that
we
are
really
going
and
are
to
have
the
very
same
room
that
she
had
one
term
when
grandfathah
was
away
from
home
and
she
boahded
there
in
little
old
lloydsboro
seminary
just
as
we
are
going
to
do
there
she
added
ruefully
clapping
her
hand
over
her
mouth
i
gone
and
told
you
and
i
intended
to
keep
you
guessing
for
an
i
knew
you
nevah
think
that
we
were
going
to
stay
right
here
in
the
valley
of
course
not
answered
rob
you
been
a
day
pupil
at
that
old
seminary
for
the
last
five
years
ever
since
you
started
to
school
naturally
suppose
that
when
you
packed
up
all
you
owned
and
started
off
to
school
you
at
least
go
out
of
the
sight
of
your
own
chimney
smoke
i
do
see
where
the
fun
is
coming
in
i
ca
think
of
anything
more
stupid
instead
of
tearing
around
the
country
on
horseback
after
lessons
as
you
always
done
riding
where
you
please
you
have
to
take
walks
with
a
gang
of
other
girls
with
a
teacher
at
the
head
of
the
procession
it
great
exercise
that
taking
steps
about
an
inch
long
and
saying
nothing
but
prunes
and
prisms
do
you
believe
that
all
cried
lloyd
we
have
to
take
the
walks
of
but
think
of
the
time
we
have
for
be
able
to
play
the
anchorage
girls
by
thanksgiving
and
i
could
have
been
on
the
team
if
i
been
only
a
day
pupil
of
course
we
miss
the
ponies
betty
added
godmother
tried
to
make
some
arrangement
with
president
wells
to
let
us
ride
every
day
but
he
said
he
could
make
an
exception
in
our
case
without
being
accused
of
partiality
if
we
came
as
regular
pupils
we
must
conform
to
the
regular
rules
and
could
not
have
even
the
liberties
we
always
had
as
day
pupils
except
in
one
thing
corrected
lloyd
we
can
still
go
to
the
for
our
mail
instead
of
having
all
our
lettahs
pass
through
the
principal
hands
mothah
thought
it
would
be
worth
while
to
change
the
address
for
just
one
term
especially
as
she
wants
me
to
forward
the
mail
that
comes
to
our
box
for
papa
jack
he
changes
his
address
so
often
on
these
business
trips
that
he
could
keep
notifying
the
postmistress
all
the
time
so
i
am
to
do
it
well
i
pity
exclaimed
rob
teasingly
tapping
his
racket
against
the
toes
of
his
tennis
shoes
are
a
bad
lot
all
that
i
ever
heard
of
scorched
oatmeal
and
dried
apples
with
old
cats
watching
at
every
keyhole
ugh
both
girls
laughed
at
his
scowl
of
disgust
and
betty
hastened
to
say
but
we
have
aunt
cindy
to
fall
back
on
if
the
fare
gets
too
bad
that
the
beauty
of
staying
so
near
home
mom
beck
is
to
come
every
monday
to
get
our
clothes
to
launder
and
every
saturday
to
bring
them
back
and
see
that
we
are
all
right
and
you
know
she
not
let
us
starve
and
there
are
any
old
cats
in
this
school
rob
miss
edith
is
a
dear
the
girls
fairly
love
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
i
sure
that
nobody
could
be
nicer
and
more
motherly
than
mrs
gelling
how
about
miss
bina
mccannister
asked
rob
with
a
wry
face
she
is
cross
enough
to
stop
a
clock
sober
and
prim
and
crabbed
with
eyes
like
a
fish
i
went
up
there
one
day
with
a
note
from
grandfather
to
professor
fowler
and
she
gave
me
such
a
stony
glare
because
i
happened
to
let
a
door
bang
that
i
had
cold
shivers
down
my
spine
for
a
week
oh
rob
laughed
lloyd
are
you
ashamed
to
talk
so
anyhow
miss
mccannister
will
not
bother
us
because
we
are
not
in
any
of
her
classes
but
she
take
her
turn
in
trotting
you
out
to
walk
just
the
same
then
think
what
a
glad
procession
that
will
be
you
feel
like
prisoners
in
a
talk
all
you
want
to
if
it
amuses
you
any
said
lloyd
passing
the
gingerbread
around
once
more
it
wo
keep
us
from
having
a
good
time
at
well
i
coming
out
again
at
thanksgiving
there
to
be
a
big
family
reunion
at
oaklea
this
year
and
if
you
stood
the
storm
and
still
think
that
life
is
funny
i
stand
treat
to
a
box
of
huyler
best
you
can
let
that
thought
buoy
you
up
through
all
the
hungry
hours
between
that
time
and
this
mercy
rob
do
throw
cold
water
on
all
our
bright
hopes
like
that
cried
betty
springing
up
as
she
heard
her
name
spoken
in
the
hall
mom
beck
wants
me
she
is
ready
to
begin
packing
my
trunk
i
must
go
in
a
few
minutes
said
rob
so
if
you
disappearing
now
i
say
till
thanksgiving
betty
held
out
her
warm
little
hand
good
sweet
child
and
let
who
will
be
clever
she
quoted
as
rob
gave
it
an
awkward
shake
practise
what
you
preach
grandma
betty
he
said
in
a
severe
tone
but
his
blue
eyes
were
smiling
into
her
brown
ones
with
a
softened
light
in
them
she
had
been
a
merry
little
comrade
in
the
summer
just
gone
and
then
there
was
something
in
the
brown
eyes
that
made
everybody
smile
on
betty
as
she
turned
to
go
she
saw
that
the
last
crumb
of
gingerbread
had
disappeared
and
stooping
picked
up
the
plate
she
recognized
it
as
her
godmother
pet
piece
of
delft
ware
i
take
this
in
before
anybody
steps
in
it
she
said
thanks
said
lloyd
lazily
without
looking
around
but
she
turned
to
rob
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
betty
is
always
so
thoughtful
about
such
things
i
would
know
how
to
get
along
without
her
now
and
to
think
when
she
first
came
heah
to
live
i
was
suah
that
i
wanted
her
i
had
nevah
had
to
divide
with
anybody
befoah
and
i
was
afraid
i
should
be
jealous
but
nobody
could
be
jealous
of
betty
she
seems
like
a
real
suah
enough
sistah
now
and
will
be
twice
the
fun
because
she
can
go
with
me
betty
a
brick
agreed
rob
emphatically
the
nicest
girl
i
know
except
you
but
i
ca
imagine
her
planning
scrapes
she
too
much
afraid
of
hurting
somebody
feelings
for
that
she
not
planning
scrapes
neithah
of
us
want
to
do
anything
really
bad
we
only
want
to
stir
the
seminary
up
a
bit
and
make
it
lively
we
growing
up
so
fast
that
if
we
do
have
some
fun
soon
it
will
be
too
late
in
only
a
few
moah
yeahs
i
be
through
school
and
then
have
to
be
a
débutante
and
settle
down
to
be
propah
and
young
ladified
mom
beck
always
used
to
be
telling
me
to
still
and
be
a
little
lady
and
if
there
anything
i
despised
it
was
that
how
fast
the
shadows
grow
long
these
afternoons
said
rob
presently
looking
at
his
watch
it
nearly
time
for
me
to
go
come
on
down
to
the
we
must
forget
our
ceremony
seven
septembers
were
marked
on
the
tall
locust
that
they
called
their
it
towered
above
a
rustic
seat
down
the
avenue
lloyd
laid
one
finger
on
the
lowest
notch
and
another
on
the
next
mark
a
few
inches
above
it
there
was
neahly
so
much
difference
in
our
heights
when
i
was
five
and
you
six
as
there
is
now
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
almost
as
tall
as
papa
jack
and
i
only
up
to
yoah
shouldah
growing
away
from
me
so
fast
bobby
rob
threw
back
his
shoulders
complacently
daddy
says
that
is
why
i
am
so
awkward
that
my
height
is
too
much
for
a
boy
to
manage
gracefully
i
soon
be
through
growing
at
this
rate
maybe
after
a
couple
of
years
more
i
not
have
to
change
the
mark
on
the
tree
i
should
certainly
hope
so
cried
lloyd
unless
you
want
to
be
a
giant
in
a
heah
measuah
me
she
stiffened
herself
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
standing
as
erect
as
possible
while
he
stuck
the
blade
of
his
knife
into
the
bark
so
close
to
the
top
of
her
head
that
he
almost
pinned
a
lock
of
the
light
hair
to
the
tree
you
grown
a
lot
too
this
last
year
lloyd
he
said
looking
down
at
her
approvingly
oh
rob
she
cried
with
a
quick
wistful
look
upward
into
his
face
i
do
want
to
grow
up
it
would
be
so
much
nicah
if
we
could
stay
children
always
we
have
had
a
lot
of
fun
under
these
old
locusts
that
a
fact
he
admitted
as
he
began
cutting
the
date
opposite
the
measurements
he
had
just
taken
then
he
became
so
absorbed
in
trying
to
make
the
figures
neatly
that
he
said
nothing
more
until
the
task
was
done
lloyd
kneeling
on
the
rustic
bench
to
watch
him
was
silent
also
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
only
sound
in
all
the
late
afternoon
sunshine
was
the
soft
rustling
of
the
leaves
overhead
if
they
could
only
stay
children
always
the
locusts
were
repeating
one
to
another
children
always
that
is
the
happiest
time
rob
intent
on
his
carving
never
noticed
the
stirring
of
the
leaves
but
the
little
colonel
who
in
a
vague
way
always
seemed
to
understand
the
whisperings
of
these
old
family
sentinels
looked
up
and
listened
as
if
she
were
one
of
them
she
began
recalling
with
them
the
scenes
they
had
looked
upon
how
long
ago
seemed
those
summer
days
when
she
measured
up
only
to
the
first
notch
mom
beck
and
rob
faithful
old
nurse
dinah
sat
on
the
bench
where
she
was
now
kneeling
and
watched
the
two
children
that
the
locusts
were
whispering
about
romping
up
and
down
the
avenue
how
well
she
remembered
the
little
blue
shoes
she
wore
and
the
jingling
of
the
bells
on
the
gay
knitted
bridle
as
they
played
horse
with
fritz
barking
wildly
at
their
heels
the
locusts
had
watched
them
in
all
the
playtimes
that
lay
between
the
first
and
last
of
those
seven
notches
eight
it
would
be
when
rob
had
finished
for
it
was
in
their
friendly
shade
they
had
rolled
their
hoops
and
spun
their
tops
and
played
at
marbles
and
made
their
kites
here
too
they
had
set
their
target
when
he
taught
her
to
shoot
with
his
air
rifle
and
up
and
down
in
the
winter
holidays
they
had
passed
with
their
skates
over
their
shoulders
with
their
sleds
dragging
after
them
or
their
arms
piled
high
with
christmas
greens
here
they
had
tramped
shoulder
to
shoulder
whistling
like
two
boys
here
they
had
raced
their
ponies
here
they
had
strolled
and
played
and
sung
together
the
strong
deep
friendship
yearly
growing
stronger
between
them
as
they
yearly
cut
a
higher
notch
in
the
bark
of
the
old
if
they
could
only
stay
children
always
whispered
the
locusts
again
with
something
so
like
a
sigh
in
the
refrain
that
lloyd
felt
the
tears
spring
to
her
eyes
she
scarcely
knew
why
there
said
rob
closing
his
knife
and
slipping
it
into
his
pocket
i
must
go
now
as
usual
lloyd
walked
down
to
the
gate
with
him
he
whistled
as
he
went
a
musical
rollicking
negro
chorus
and
she
joined
in
with
an
accompaniment
of
little
trills
and
calls
in
clever
imitation
of
a
but
just
before
they
reached
the
gate
her
whistling
stopped
her
quick
eyes
spied
a
clover
in
the
grass
and
she
sprang
forward
to
get
it
and
heah
anothah
she
cried
triumphantly
one
for
you
too
rob
that
means
good
luck
for
both
of
us
put
it
in
yoah
pocket
rob
took
the
little
charm
she
held
out
with
a
skeptical
smile
yet
he
had
imbibed
too
great
a
belief
in
such
omens
from
his
old
coloured
nurse
not
to
regard
it
with
respect
thanks
he
said
i
have
a
safer
place
than
my
pocket
i
need
all
the
luck
this
or
anything
else
can
bring
me
in
my
latin
this
year
so
i
carry
it
to
every
recitation
opening
the
back
of
his
watch
he
carefully
smoothed
the
green
petals
and
laid
them
inside
then
closed
the
case
with
a
snap
now
i
fixed
he
said
with
a
nod
of
satisfaction
at
the
gate
they
did
not
shake
hands
but
parted
as
they
had
done
so
many
times
before
as
if
they
expected
to
begin
their
playtime
on
the
morrow
lloyd
was
all
he
said
with
a
slight
lifting
of
his
cap
as
he
walked
away
bobby
she
answered
she
stood
for
a
moment
shading
her
eyes
from
the
sunset
with
the
hand
that
held
the
clover
as
she
watched
him
go
striding
down
the
road
toward
oaklea
switching
with
his
tennis
racket
at
the
asters
and
goldenrod
along
his
path
then
she
went
slowly
back
to
the
house
thinking
how
tall
he
looked
as
he
strode
away
as
she
passed
the
she
looked
up
at
the
old
locusts
overhead
and
sure
of
their
sympathy
said
oh
i
we
did
have
to
grow
up
chapter
ii
a
new
friend
lloydsboro
seminary
was
not
an
especially
attractive
place
viewed
from
the
outside
of
the
high
picket
fence
which
surrounded
its
entire
domain
the
fence
itself
was
forbidding
its
tall
pickets
and
close
together
seemed
to
suggest
that
strict
rules
were
to
be
found
inside
rules
like
the
pickets
too
firm
and
pointed
to
be
easily
broken
through
or
climbed
over
the
building
was
old
and
but
in
its
prime
the
school
had
been
one
of
the
best
in
the
state
and
many
a
woman
remembered
it
loyally
in
after
years
when
she
had
daughters
of
her
own
to
educate
so
it
happened
that
some
of
the
pupils
came
long
distances
and
from
many
parts
of
the
country
to
sit
at
the
same
old
desks
their
mothers
sat
at
to
study
the
same
old
lessons
and
to
learn
to
love
every
rock
and
tree
on
the
seminary
grounds
because
of
their
associations
with
all
the
warm
young
friendships
formed
there
a
group
of
maples
and
cedars
stood
between
the
seminary
and
the
high
green
picket
gate
in
front
with
a
score
of
rustic
seats
and
wooden
swings
scattered
about
in
their
shade
on
the
east
an
old
neglected
apple
orchard
sloped
away
from
the
house
where
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
school
hard
juicy
winesaps
russets
and
bellflowers
lay
in
hiding
from
the
hungry
schoolgirls
who
searched
for
them
in
the
tall
grass
waving
among
the
trees
on
the
other
side
the
high
fence
separated
the
grounds
from
the
closely
clipped
lawn
of
clovercroft
one
of
the
hospitable
old
homesteads
of
the
valley
whose
wide
porches
and
tower
made
a
charming
picture
from
the
western
windows
of
the
seminary
the
opening
day
of
school
was
always
a
sort
of
gala
occasion
no
regular
work
could
be
done
for
pupils
were
continually
coming
in
on
the
various
trains
to
be
registered
and
assigned
to
classes
after
chapel
exercises
the
day
pupils
were
at
liberty
to
go
home
but
it
was
a
custom
for
them
to
adjourn
to
the
apple
orchard
to
hold
a
reunion
with
all
the
last
year
boarders
who
had
returned
the
swings
and
seats
in
front
of
the
seminary
were
left
for
the
newcomers
many
a
longing
glance
was
cast
toward
the
orchard
by
the
strangers
who
left
thus
inhospitably
alone
made
shy
advances
toward
acquaintance
among
themselves
on
the
morrow
they
too
might
be
included
in
the
friendly
little
groups
exchanging
confidences
with
their
heads
close
together
and
walking
with
their
arms
around
each
other
under
the
gnarly
old
trees
but
that
they
should
be
ignored
the
first
day
was
as
binding
as
the
unwritten
laws
of
the
jungle
from
her
seat
in
the
swing
nearest
the
house
a
new
girl
watched
the
others
swarming
out
from
chapel
laughing
and
talking
and
calling
to
those
ahead
to
wait
the
primary
grades
went
racing
through
the
warm
morning
sunshine
down
to
their
playhouses
by
the
spring
the
seniors
and
juniors
strolled
off
in
opposite
directions
in
dignified
exclusiveness
to
different
parts
of
the
orchard
each
group
as
it
passed
attracted
the
new
girl
attention
but
her
interest
centred
in
a
dozen
or
more
girls
lingering
on
the
front
steps
their
ages
seemed
to
range
from
twelve
to
fifteen
years
they
were
evidently
waiting
for
some
one
why
do
they
hurry
asked
an
impatient
voice
what
the
matter
the
matron
stopped
them
some
one
answered
i
heard
her
asking
about
some
bedding
that
was
to
be
sent
from
locust
it
was
nearly
five
minutes
before
some
one
interrupted
a
discussion
that
had
begun
to
call
here
they
come
then
a
chorus
of
calls
began
most
confusing
to
the
girl
in
the
swing
who
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
newcomers
who
seemed
to
be
so
popular
i
bid
to
walk
with
the
little
colonel
come
on
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
i
waiting
for
you
hurry
up
betty
i
got
something
to
tell
you
lloyd
lloyd
sherman
ca
you
hear
is
it
really
true
that
you
are
going
to
board
here
with
the
two
girls
in
their
midst
trying
to
explain
to
a
dozen
different
questioners
in
the
same
breath
when
and
why
they
had
become
resident
pupils
the
noisy
procession
moved
on
only
one
was
left
behind
a
child
in
spectacles
who
in
spite
of
all
their
protests
stood
looking
after
them
insisting
she
must
wait
for
sue
bell
as
the
others
moved
away
the
new
girl
beckoned
to
her
with
a
friendly
smile
you
janie
clung
are
you
she
asked
as
the
little
girl
advanced
a
few
steps
and
then
stood
awkwardly
rubbing
one
foot
against
the
other
you
see
i
could
help
hearing
your
name
they
spoke
it
so
often
i
am
ida
shane
from
clay
county
wo
you
sit
here
in
the
swing
with
me
until
the
girl
you
are
waiting
for
comes
out
and
tell
me
something
about
the
school
it
so
hard
she
added
plaintively
to
be
a
stranger
in
a
place
where
everybody
else
has
so
many
friends
you
seem
to
know
every
one
here
from
the
way
they
all
begged
you
to
go
with
them
i
imagine
you
must
be
very
popular
much
flattered
by
this
last
remark
from
one
so
much
older
than
herself
janie
climbed
into
the
seat
in
the
swing
opposite
the
girl
from
clay
county
and
scrutinized
her
shyly
ida
shane
was
very
pretty
she
decided
she
must
be
nearly
sixteen
or
maybe
more
for
she
wore
her
dresses
long
and
her
hair
in
a
soft
fluffy
pompadour
then
janie
gaze
wandered
from
her
hair
to
a
bewitching
little
dimple
that
came
at
the
corner
of
ida
mouth
when
she
smiled
and
she
thought
to
herself
that
the
slow
soft
drawl
in
which
ida
spoke
was
exceedingly
musical
and
ladylike
she
found
herself
talking
in
a
lower
tone
than
usual
and
quite
slowly
when
she
answered
you
know
i
think
it
is
always
best
to
be
very
particular
in
choosing
friends
when
one
goes
to
a
new
place
ida
remarked
in
a
confidential
tone
which
seemed
to
insinuate
that
janie
could
be
safely
chosen
i
do
want
to
take
up
with
everybody
that
why
i
want
you
to
tell
me
which
are
the
first
families
here
in
the
valley
and
which
are
the
girls
whose
friendship
is
worth
while
having
simple
little
janie
who
considered
friendship
with
everybody
worth
having
looked
puzzled
well
for
instance
who
were
those
two
girls
in
white
duck
dresses
whom
you
were
all
waiting
for
so
long
the
one
with
the
lovely
long
light
hair
that
they
called
lloyd
and
the
little
colonel
now
and
all
the
girls
seem
to
regard
her
as
a
sort
of
leader
tell
me
about
her
oh
that
lloyd
sherman
answered
janie
i
reckon
you
might
say
she
belongs
to
one
of
the
first
families
she
lives
in
a
perfectly
beautiful
place
called
locust
the
valley
is
named
after
some
of
her
ancestors
and
old
colonel
lloyd
is
her
grandfather
colonel
is
just
one
of
her
nicknames
she
had
everything
that
heart
could
wish
and
has
been
to
europe
when
she
came
back
she
brought
a
magnificent
bernard
dog
with
her
that
had
been
trained
as
a
red
cross
for
the
ambulance
service
in
the
german
army
they
called
him
hero
and
he
acted
in
a
play
they
gave
here
last
fall
called
the
of
the
princess
winsome
i
was
one
of
the
flower
messengers
in
the
play
lloyd
was
the
princess
she
looked
exactly
like
one
that
night
the
dog
saved
her
life
while
they
were
in
switzerland
and
when
he
died
the
family
made
as
much
fuss
over
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
person
he
was
buried
with
military
honours
and
there
is
a
handsome
monument
over
his
grave
i
show
it
to
you
sometime
when
we
walk
past
locust
janie
paused
with
a
long
breath
it
was
more
of
a
speech
than
she
was
accustomed
to
making
but
ida
had
listened
with
such
flattering
attention
that
it
was
easier
to
talk
to
her
than
to
any
one
whom
she
had
ever
known
i
thought
she
was
like
that
remarked
ida
in
an
tone
i
rarely
make
mistakes
in
people
now
that
other
one
they
call
betty
she
has
a
sweet
face
i
should
say
she
has
cried
janie
warmly
she
the
dearest
girl
in
school
everybody
loves
betty
lewis
she
is
sherman
goddaughter
and
lives
at
locust
too
she
writes
the
loveliest
poetry
why
she
wrote
that
whole
play
of
the
princess
winsome
and
every
one
thought
it
was
wonderful
sherman
had
several
copies
of
it
printed
and
bound
in
carved
leather
he
gave
one
copy
to
the
seminary
library
so
you
can
read
it
if
you
want
to
that
be
the
first
thing
i
shall
draw
from
the
library
said
ida
nodding
approvingly
at
the
account
of
betty
then
there
some
one
else
i
want
to
ask
about
she
continued
i
was
told
that
general
family
lives
here
and
that
his
daughters
go
to
this
school
i
mind
telling
you
in
confidence
you
know
that
that
is
what
made
my
aunt
finally
decide
to
send
me
to
this
school
instead
of
the
one
in
frankfort
were
they
here
this
morning
yes
and
they
are
lloyd
best
friends
maybe
you
noticed
two
girls
in
pink
with
great
dark
eyes
lovely
eyes
who
walked
off
with
her
one
on
each
side
yes
i
wondered
who
they
were
the
larger
one
was
allison
and
the
other
one
kitty
they
live
at
the
beeches
we
walk
past
there
nearly
every
day
once
last
year
miss
edith
took
some
of
us
in
there
and
walton
showed
us
all
her
curios
and
relics
it
is
a
fascinating
place
to
visit
there
are
things
from
all
over
the
world
in
every
room
and
a
story
about
each
one
how
interesting
smiled
ida
showing
a
glimpse
of
her
dimple
and
passing
a
slim
hand
glittering
with
many
rings
over
her
pompadour
you
ca
imagine
how
entertaining
you
are
janie
tell
me
some
more
with
a
slight
movement
of
the
foot
she
started
the
swing
to
swaying
and
leaning
back
in
the
seat
with
an
air
of
attention
waited
for
janie
to
go
on
with
such
a
listener
janie
was
in
a
fair
way
to
tell
all
she
knew
when
sue
bell
appeared
in
the
doorway
beckoning
to
her
she
even
felt
a
decided
sense
of
annoyance
at
the
interruption
although
sue
bell
was
her
dearest
friend
so
much
was
she
enjoying
ida
as
an
audience
that
new
girl
is
perfectly
lovely
she
declared
to
sue
bell
as
they
moved
off
together
she
repeated
the
opinion
so
often
after
she
reached
the
orchard
and
had
so
much
to
say
about
ida
shane
hair
and
ida
shane
dimple
and
the
stacks
of
rings
she
had
and
the
stylish
clothes
she
wore
that
some
of
the
girls
exchanged
amused
glances
kitty
walton
remarked
in
a
teasing
tone
that
she
believed
the
new
girl
must
have
hoodooed
janie
clung
so
that
she
could
do
anything
but
sing
her
praises
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
talk
that
way
kitty
walton
cried
janie
in
angry
defence
of
her
new
friend
especially
when
she
said
such
nice
things
about
your
family
being
celebrities
and
that
was
one
reason
her
aunt
sent
her
to
this
school
because
the
daughters
of
such
a
famous
general
were
pupils
here
and
she
thinks
lloyd
is
so
and
betty
awfully
sweet
and
so
smart
to
write
that
play
and
she
said
even
if
you
all
are
lots
younger
than
herself
she
rather
have
you
for
her
friends
than
any
of
the
seniors
because
she
could
tell
just
by
looking
at
you
that
you
belong
to
the
best
old
families
in
the
place
what
did
she
say
about
the
rest
of
us
cried
mittie
dupong
mockingly
winking
at
her
nearest
neighbour
janie
turning
in
time
to
see
the
wink
answered
shortly
nothing
she
does
intend
to
make
friends
with
it
was
an
indiscreet
speech
and
the
moment
it
was
made
she
realized
that
it
would
be
counted
against
ida
instead
of
in
her
favour
as
she
had
intended
it
to
be
significant
glances
passed
among
those
who
had
not
been
included
in
ida
classification
of
celebrities
or
first
families
and
mittie
dupong
retorted
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
hm
miss
shane
may
find
that
there
are
people
in
the
world
as
particular
as
herself
who
is
anyway
that
she
should
give
herself
such
airs
no
one
answered
the
question
but
there
was
sown
at
that
moment
in
more
than
one
girl
mind
a
little
seed
of
dislike
which
took
deep
root
as
the
days
went
by
but
if
ida
thoughtlessly
repeated
speech
worked
her
ill
in
one
way
it
had
an
opposite
effect
with
those
whose
favour
she
wished
most
to
gain
allison
and
kitty
met
her
with
especial
friendliness
when
janie
stopped
them
at
the
swing
as
they
started
home
at
noon
it
was
pleasant
for
them
to
feel
that
she
had
been
drawn
to
the
school
partly
on
their
account
it
gave
them
a
sense
of
importance
they
had
never
experienced
before
lloyd
too
unconsciously
influenced
by
the
flattering
recollection
that
she
had
been
singled
out
from
all
the
others
as
took
especial
care
to
be
gracious
when
she
found
herself
seated
across
from
ida
at
the
the
old
pupils
had
been
given
their
usual
places
but
betty
and
lloyd
were
among
the
newcomers
now
i
feel
for
the
first
time
that
i
really
away
at
lloyd
said
with
a
smile
which
included
ida
in
the
conversation
as
she
glanced
down
the
long
table
stretched
the
entire
length
of
the
it
seems
as
if
we
might
be
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
home
instead
of
one
i
can
hardly
believe
that
we
are
still
in
lloydsboro
valley
betty
is
it
time
for
us
to
begin
to
feel
homesick
not
till
dark
comes
answered
betty
twilight
is
the
regulation
time
in
stories
lloyd
smiled
across
at
ida
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
be
homesick
oh
no
indeed
answered
ida
in
her
slow
sweet
voice
the
dimple
which
had
charmed
janie
flashed
into
sight
this
is
the
fourth
i
have
been
sent
to
i
am
used
to
going
to
new
places
the
exclaimed
lloyd
with
surprised
emphasis
a
curious
why
almost
slipped
off
her
tongue
but
she
stopped
it
politely
in
the
middle
and
managed
to
stammer
instead
as
she
salted
her
soup
fun
you
must
have
had
i
have
answered
ida
with
a
glance
toward
the
end
of
the
table
where
miss
bina
mccannister
sat
grim
and
watchful
sometime
i
tell
you
about
some
of
my
adventures
as
the
dinner
progressed
both
lloyd
and
betty
felt
themselves
yielding
to
the
soft
charm
of
manner
which
had
won
little
janie
admiration
and
by
the
time
they
had
finished
their
dessert
they
were
ready
to
join
in
janie
most
enthusiastic
praises
of
the
new
girl
do
you
know
that
my
room
is
in
the
same
wing
with
yours
just
next
door
ida
asked
as
they
rose
from
the
table
at
least
i
think
so
for
as
i
came
down
to
dinner
i
saw
some
trunks
being
carried
in
there
marked
and
i
am
so
glad
exclaimed
lloyd
i
wondered
who
we
should
have
for
neighbahs
betty
and
i
ran
up
there
a
few
minutes
this
mawning
but
the
beds
and
things
mothah
wanted
us
to
use
had
been
sent
ovah
from
locust
and
it
was
so
we
did
stay
i
came
yesterday
said
ida
as
the
three
went
up
the
stairs
together
so
i
had
time
to
investigate
i
imagine
we
shall
be
able
to
do
about
as
we
please
you
see
this
wing
of
the
house
was
added
several
years
after
the
main
part
was
built
so
there
are
four
rooms
on
this
floor
nicely
cut
off
by
themselves
she
opened
the
door
from
the
main
corridor
and
led
the
way
into
the
narrow
which
separated
the
four
rooms
from
the
rest
of
the
house
several
nights
in
the
week
the
three
of
us
will
be
here
alone
she
said
this
tiny
room
at
the
end
belongs
to
that
queer
little
magnolia
budine
whom
everybody
laughed
at
this
morning
she
lives
near
enough
the
seminary
to
go
home
every
friday
night
and
stay
till
monday
morning
the
three
clark
sisters
have
this
big
room
next
to
hers
and
they
go
home
to
spend
sundays
too
by
the
way
was
it
ridiculous
the
way
miss
mccannister
got
their
names
all
balled
up
this
morning
in
the
history
division
trying
to
say
it
was
funny
laughed
lloyd
kitty
walton
whispered
to
me
that
they
ought
to
be
called
the
triplets
because
every
one
trips
and
stuttahs
ovah
their
names
it
as
bad
as
trying
to
say
slim
slick
silvah
saplings
they
had
reached
the
third
room
by
this
time
the
door
of
which
stood
open
this
is
ours
said
lloyd
the
very
same
one
mothah
had
one
term
when
she
was
a
girl
she
paused
on
the
threshold
looking
around
the
large
airy
apartment
well
pleased
i
wonder
if
the
outside
stairway
was
built
when
she
was
here
said
ida
i
discovered
it
yesterday
i
nevah
heard
her
say
anything
about
it
said
lloyd
where
is
it
this
way
answered
ida
leading
them
past
her
own
room
which
came
next
and
pushing
aside
a
heavy
portière
which
covered
a
door
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
from
magnolia
budine
room
the
matron
told
me
that
a
slight
fire
in
the
school
one
time
led
to
the
building
of
this
extra
means
of
escape
but
the
girls
are
forbidden
to
use
the
stairs
for
any
other
purpose
let
open
it
proposed
lloyd
daringly
fumbling
with
the
bolt
which
had
lain
so
long
unused
that
it
had
rusted
in
its
socket
it
moved
stiffly
with
a
grating
sound
as
she
pushed
it
back
the
door
swung
open
on
to
a
small
uncovered
landing
from
which
an
open
staircase
descended
to
the
rear
of
the
kitchen
i
often
seen
these
steps
from
the
outside
said
lloyd
but
i
did
know
where
they
led
to
no
i
nevah
heard
mothah
speak
of
them
is
it
fun
to
have
a
secret
stairway
of
our
own
why
do
you
suppose
they
have
a
curtain
ovah
the
doah
to
hide
it
said
betty
wisely
so
that
the
daily
sight
of
it
will
not
put
it
into
our
naughty
heads
to
make
use
of
it
and
prowl
around
at
nights
they
evidently
think
oft
the
sight
of
means
to
do
ill
deeds
makes
ill
deeds
done
so
they
cover
it
up
that
from
shakespeare
is
it
asked
ida
i
give
anything
if
i
could
make
appropriate
quotations
like
that
but
i
never
think
of
the
right
thing
till
it
too
late
but
then
i
suppose
it
comes
easy
to
any
one
smart
enough
to
write
as
you
do
i
am
so
anxious
to
read
that
play
of
yours
rescue
of
the
princess
winsome
i
was
told
that
there
is
a
copy
in
the
library
your
room
ought
to
be
called
peas
since
it
belongs
to
a
princess
and
a
poetess
betty
blushed
with
pleasure
they
had
bolted
the
door
again
and
were
standing
in
front
of
their
room
as
ida
proposed
the
name
of
sweet
peas
it
is
kind
of
you
to
give
us
such
a
sweet
name
for
our
room
said
lloyd
will
you
come
in
while
we
unpack
no
thank
you
was
the
answer
i
have
some
letters
to
write
before
four
that
is
the
time
i
believe
when
we
all
have
to
turn
out
together
for
a
walk
she
turned
away
but
came
back
to
ask
hesitatingly
there
one
thing
i
like
to
ask
lloyd
do
you
mind
if
i
call
you
princess
instead
of
lloyd
the
princess
winsome
that
name
seems
to
suit
you
so
well
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
you
was
the
proud
little
way
you
lift
your
head
you
carry
yourself
like
one
a
bright
colour
swept
across
lloyd
face
of
i
do
mind
she
said
and
it
is
deah
of
you
to
care
to
call
me
that
when
ida
went
back
to
her
own
room
it
was
with
the
comfortable
feeling
that
she
had
left
a
very
agreeable
impression
behind
her
is
she
a
darling
exclaimed
lloyd
enthusiastically
when
she
and
betty
were
alone
with
their
door
closed
she
is
pretty
and
stylish
and
certainly
has
lovely
mannahs
besides
she
is
as
as
can
be
and
mighty
entahtaining
i
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
so
have
i
admitted
betty
i
love
to
sit
and
watch
her
the
least
thing
she
says
in
that
soft
slow
way
sounds
sweet
i
am
so
glad
that
her
room
is
next
to
ours
sherman
had
advised
taking
few
furnishings
to
the
seminary
but
lloyd
insisted
that
they
could
not
feel
that
they
were
really
away
at
unless
they
had
all
that
goes
to
equip
a
modern
college
girl
room
so
pictures
and
posters
and
were
crowded
into
the
overflowing
trunks
a
a
a
dainty
and
a
mandolin
were
brought
over
in
the
carriage
that
took
sherman
to
the
depot
both
girls
were
kept
busy
until
four
finding
places
to
put
their
numerous
possessions
neither
one
realized
how
far
she
had
passed
under
the
spell
of
the
new
pupil
but
unconsciously
every
picture
they
hung
and
every
article
they
unpacked
was
located
with
a
thought
of
her
approval
once
as
lloyd
passed
the
mirror
when
betty
back
was
turned
she
paused
to
look
at
her
reflection
with
the
pleased
consciousness
that
ida
had
spoken
the
truth
that
she
did
hold
her
head
proudly
and
carry
herself
well
and
betty
several
times
passed
her
hand
up
over
the
brown
curls
on
her
forehead
recalling
the
graceful
gesture
of
the
white
heavily
ringed
hand
while
she
tacked
up
posters
and
put
away
clothes
she
chattered
busily
with
lloyd
but
through
her
thoughts
like
an
undercurrent
to
their
conversation
ran
a
few
musical
lines
suggested
by
the
white
hands
and
low
voice
an
ode
to
ida
had
already
begun
to
weave
itself
into
shape
in
her
busy
little
brain
a
few
minutes
before
the
gong
sounded
summoning
the
girls
to
the
first
of
their
daily
walks
ida
tapped
on
the
door
she
had
only
stopped
to
ask
a
question
about
the
rules
she
said
and
must
run
back
and
put
on
her
hat
but
catching
sight
of
a
picture
of
the
long
avenue
at
locust
which
hung
over
lloyd
bed
she
crossed
the
room
to
examine
it
you
made
a
perfect
love
of
a
room
with
all
these
handsome
things
she
said
looking
around
admiringly
but
she
scanned
the
few
photographs
on
the
mantel
and
the
two
on
the
in
their
frames
of
beaten
silver
it
seems
so
queer
you
know
you
have
the
picture
of
a
single
boy
did
you
bring
any
no
answered
lloyd
in
surprise
why
should
i
but
you
have
some
at
home
have
you
persisted
ida
yes
i
have
lovely
ones
of
allison
walton
cousins
malcolm
and
keith
macintyre
taken
in
the
costumes
they
wore
as
little
knights
of
kentucky
and
i
have
one
of
ranald
walton
taken
in
his
uniform
and
nearly
a
dozen
of
rob
moore
he
given
me
one
whenevah
he
had
them
taken
from
the
time
he
wore
kilts
and
curls
my
exclaimed
ida
why
did
you
bring
them
they
would
have
been
such
an
addition
because
i
do
want
any
boy
pictuah
stuck
up
on
my
i
like
to
have
them
because
they
been
my
playmates
always
and
when
we
grown
up
i
like
to
remembah
just
how
they
looked
but
that
no
reason
i
want
my
walls
plastahed
with
them
now
what
an
original
little
thing
you
are
princess
exclaimed
ida
with
a
laugh
which
would
have
nettled
lloyd
had
not
the
compliment
and
the
title
taken
away
its
sting
come
into
my
room
and
see
how
my
walls
are
plastered
as
you
call
it
lloyd
stared
around
in
astonishment
when
ida
threw
open
her
door
boyish
faces
looked
back
at
her
from
every
side
handsome
ones
homely
ones
in
groups
in
pairs
framed
and
unframed
strung
together
with
ribbons
or
stuck
in
behind
japanese
fans
added
to
all
the
other
pictures
of
girls
she
had
known
in
the
three
which
she
had
attended
it
gave
the
room
the
appearance
of
a
photograph
gallery
well
exclaimed
lloyd
at
length
after
a
long
slow
survey
i
see
what
you
want
them
for
unconsciously
her
head
took
the
haughty
uplift
which
ida
had
admired
for
the
same
reason
that
an
indian
hangs
up
all
the
he
takes
i
suppose
drawled
ida
sweetly
of
course
you
young
yet
you
do
understand
but
you
look
at
things
differently
when
you
are
as
near
sixteen
as
i
am
princess
again
that
flattering
title
took
the
sting
out
of
the
patronizing
manner
which
lloyd
otherwise
would
have
resented
was
it
only
the
afternoon
before
she
wondered
that
she
had
cried
out
to
the
friendly
old
locusts
her
longing
to
be
a
child
always
as
ida
crossed
the
room
with
a
graceful
sweep
of
long
skirts
and
settled
her
hat
with
its
clusters
of
violets
jauntily
over
her
fluffy
pompadour
there
stole
into
the
little
colonel
heart
for
the
first
time
a
vague
desire
a
wish
that
she
too
were
as
near
the
borders
of
land
as
sweet
sixteen
chapter
iii
ida
secret
betty
said
lloyd
one
morning
the
third
week
of
school
as
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
lacing
her
shoes
you
know
that
little
you
embroidered
for
my
birthday
present
would
you
feel
hurt
if
i
were
to
give
it
away
no
answered
betty
slowly
turning
from
the
mirror
brush
in
hand
i
made
it
to
please
you
and
if
you
can
find
more
pleasure
in
giving
it
away
than
in
keeping
it
i
be
glad
for
you
to
give
it
away
honestly
betty
yes
honestly
the
brown
eyes
turned
with
truthful
directness
toward
lloyd
oh
you
are
such
a
comfortable
sort
of
person
to
live
with
betty
lewis
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
with
a
sigh
of
relief
most
girls
would
think
that
i
did
appreciate
all
those
fine
stitches
you
put
into
it
and
did
care
for
eithah
the
gift
or
the
givah
if
i
was
willing
to
part
with
it
but
i
was
suah
you
would
undahstand
you
see
the
violets
on
it
make
it
such
a
perfect
match
for
everything
on
that
it
seems
as
if
it
ought
to
belong
to
her
i
look
at
a
violet
now
without
thinking
of
her
she
is
so
much
like
one
do
you
think
refined
and
sweet
and
her
eyes
are
such
a
dark
blue
and
have
such
a
shy
appealing
way
of
looking
out
from
undah
those
long
lashes
and
have
you
evah
noticed
what
delicious
sachet
she
uses
so
faint
it
not
much
moah
than
the
whispah
of
a
smell
but
there
always
a
touch
of
it
about
everything
belonging
to
her
i
call
her
violet
all
the
time
now
only
the
mirror
saw
the
bored
expression
that
shaded
betty
face
for
an
instant
for
the
last
week
morning
noon
and
night
she
had
heard
nothing
from
lloyd
but
ida
praises
a
sudden
intimacy
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
which
threatened
to
eclipse
all
lloyd
other
friendships
betty
began
brushing
her
hair
vigorously
will
you
promise
not
to
feel
hurt
if
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
she
asked
lloyd
nodded
lazily
wondering
what
was
coming
as
she
reached
down
to
pick
up
her
other
shoe
she
did
not
put
it
on
however
but
sat
with
it
in
her
hand
staring
at
betty
scarcely
believing
that
she
heard
aright
the
advice
was
so
different
from
anything
she
had
expected
then
do
call
her
violet
before
the
other
girls
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
do
believe
i
talk
about
her
to
them
quite
as
much
as
you
do
you
see
she
hurried
on
noticing
the
quick
flush
of
displeasure
on
lloyd
face
i
do
suppose
you
realize
how
much
you
do
talk
about
her
or
how
you
have
changed
lately
last
year
you
were
good
friends
with
all
the
girls
ready
for
any
fun
they
proposed
they
liked
that
independent
bossy
little
way
you
had
of
deciding
things
for
them
that
was
one
thing
that
made
you
so
popular
but
now
you
always
wait
to
find
out
what
ida
thinks
and
what
ida
wants
and
they
feel
that
you
not
only
dropped
your
old
friends
for
a
stranger
whom
known
only
three
weeks
but
that
in
some
sort
of
a
way
i
ca
explain
it
you
dropped
your
old
self
too
really
i
believe
that
they
are
as
jealous
of
the
influence
she
has
over
you
as
of
the
way
she
monopolizes
you
betty
did
not
see
the
gathering
storm
in
the
little
colonel
face
and
went
serenely
on
brushing
her
hair
you
know
she
so
much
older
than
you
they
always
smile
so
significantly
when
she
calls
you
princess
as
if
they
thought
she
was
doing
it
to
flatter
you
while
they
say
it
openly
to
me
of
course
i
heard
them
whispering
among
themselves
that
ida
had
hoodooed
you
as
she
had
janie
clung
so
that
all
you
live
for
nowadays
is
to
wait
on
her
and
buy
her
candy
and
violets
bang
went
lloyd
shoe
against
the
wall
she
had
sent
it
spinning
across
the
room
with
all
her
force
betty
turning
in
dismay
saw
that
the
advice
which
she
had
given
with
the
kindest
of
motives
had
aroused
the
little
colonel
temper
to
white
heat
the
mean
hateful
things
she
cried
they
no
right
to
talk
about
ida
that
way
the
idea
of
her
stooping
to
such
a
thing
as
to
flatter
any
one
for
what
she
could
get
out
of
them
it
an
outrageous
but
lloyd
dear
interrupted
betty
listen
a
minute
you
promised
that
you
would
get
mad
or
i
would
have
said
a
word
i
not
mad
with
you
but
mittie
dupong
and
some
of
the
rest
of
them
have
been
hateful
to
ida
from
the
very
first
there
was
something
like
a
sob
in
her
voice
and
she
so
alone
in
the
world
too
she
told
me
things
about
her
life
that
almost
made
me
cry
her
aunt
undahstand
her
at
all
and
she
has
a
time
at
home
but
she
need
feel
alone
in
the
world
here
insisted
betty
every
girl
in
school
would
have
been
her
friend
if
she
had
said
at
the
start
that
she
did
care
for
anybody
but
us
and
the
walton
girls
they
be
only
too
glad
to
take
her
in
even
now
for
the
sake
of
having
you
back
again
oh
it
was
so
much
nicer
last
year
lloyd
faced
her
indignantly
betty
lewis
she
exclaimed
against
her
too
or
you
would
say
that
no
i
not
insisted
betty
i
like
her
now
just
as
much
as
i
did
the
first
day
i
saw
her
i
think
she
is
sweet
and
lovable
and
i
wonder
that
you
are
very
fond
of
her
but
i
must
say
that
i
sorry
that
she
in
the
school
for
you
do
seem
to
care
for
anything
now
but
being
with
her
and
that
spoils
all
the
good
times
we
had
planned
to
have
dead
silence
followed
betty
speech
the
little
colonel
walked
across
the
room
picked
up
her
shoe
and
put
it
on
jerking
the
laces
savagely
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
been
angry
with
betty
and
her
wrath
was
more
than
betty
could
endure
please
do
feel
hurt
lloyd
she
begged
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
angry
with
me
i
would
have
said
a
word
only
i
thought
that
if
it
was
explained
to
you
how
we
all
felt
you
be
willing
to
spend
a
little
more
time
with
the
others
and
gradually
they
get
interested
in
ida
and
be
nice
to
her
for
your
sake
and
things
would
go
on
as
they
used
to
when
we
all
had
such
good
times
together
again
the
painful
silence
so
deep
that
betty
felt
as
if
a
wall
had
risen
between
them
please
lloyd
she
begged
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
lloyd
with
an
air
of
injured
dignity
went
on
dressing
without
a
word
until
the
last
bow
was
tied
and
the
last
pin
in
place
and
she
knew
all
the
time
that
ida
is
my
dearest
friend
lloyd
kept
saying
angrily
to
herself
as
she
moved
about
the
room
i
could
have
forgiven
her
saying
mean
things
about
but
for
her
to
stand
up
and
say
to
my
very
face
that
she
is
sorry
ida
is
in
the
school
and
that
her
being
here
spoils
all
the
good
times
when
she
what
i
think
of
ida
that
is
simply
a
plain
insult
and
i
can
nevah
feel
the
same
to
betty
lewis
again
by
the
time
the
rang
both
the
girls
were
almost
in
tears
for
the
longer
betty
speech
rankled
in
lloyd
mind
the
worse
it
hurt
and
the
longer
the
angry
silence
continued
the
worse
betty
felt
it
is
not
like
lloyd
to
be
so
unfair
thought
betty
she
just
so
blinded
by
her
infatuation
for
ida
that
she
ca
see
my
side
of
the
matter
at
all
it
was
on
the
point
of
her
tongue
to
speak
her
thought
but
realizing
that
it
would
only
add
fuel
to
the
flame
she
checked
the
impulse
and
in
the
same
uncomfortable
silence
they
marched
stiffly
down
the
stairs
to
breakfast
it
was
a
miserable
day
for
both
to
betty
it
seemed
endless
she
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
back
when
she
stood
up
to
recite
and
instead
of
joining
the
other
girls
at
recess
she
wandered
off
with
a
pencil
and
sitting
in
one
of
the
swings
she
wrote
some
verses
about
broken
friendships
that
made
her
cry
they
began
dead
are
the
snowy
daisies
dead
are
the
flowers
of
may
the
winds
are
hoarse
and
voiceless
the
skies
are
cold
and
gray
and
yet
a
more
gloriously
golden
october
day
had
never
shone
in
the
valley
the
sun
on
the
sumach
bushes
and
sweet
turned
their
leaves
to
a
flaming
red
that
the
heart
of
a
ruby
might
have
envied
and
the
dogwood
berries
redder
than
any
rose
glowed
like
living
fire
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
for
the
last
week
lloyd
and
ida
had
spent
every
recess
together
wandering
off
by
themselves
to
a
far
corner
of
the
apple
orchard
where
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
provided
them
with
a
seat
and
its
twisted
branches
with
a
rustic
screen
but
this
day
when
lloyd
needed
sympathy
and
companionship
more
than
on
any
other
it
was
suddenly
denied
her
ida
had
a
worried
air
when
she
came
out
at
recess
after
the
distribution
of
the
morning
mail
she
came
up
to
lloyd
in
the
hall
with
a
grave
face
i
am
in
trouble
princess
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
explain
sometime
before
long
but
i
must
go
to
my
room
now
i
have
an
important
letter
to
write
with
heavy
forebodings
lloyd
wandered
back
to
her
desk
and
sat
looking
listlessly
out
of
the
open
window
she
could
hear
laughter
and
merry
voices
in
conversation
outside
nuts
rattled
down
from
the
old
by
the
well
and
an
odour
of
wild
grapes
floated
in
from
the
vine
that
trailed
over
it
where
some
belated
bunches
hung
too
high
for
any
fingers
but
the
frost
to
touch
she
took
no
interest
in
anything
the
afternoon
recess
passed
in
the
same
way
miss
bina
mccannister
led
the
procession
when
they
went
for
their
afternoon
walk
ida
had
been
excused
from
joining
them
so
lloyd
walked
beside
janie
clung
in
stony
silence
betty
was
in
front
of
them
and
lloyd
almost
stepping
on
her
heels
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
remark
that
had
changed
her
whole
day
to
gall
and
wormwood
she
resented
it
doubly
now
that
poor
ida
was
in
some
mysterious
trouble
betty
occasionally
cast
an
anxious
glance
backward
she
surely
make
up
before
the
sun
goes
down
she
thought
but
the
sun
went
down
as
they
strolled
homeward
the
moon
came
up
and
lights
twinkled
from
all
the
seminary
windows
the
rang
and
a
horde
of
hungry
girls
poured
into
the
but
through
all
the
cheerful
clatter
of
dishes
and
hum
of
voices
lloyd
kept
her
dignified
silence
toward
betty
unbroken
ida
had
evidently
been
crying
and
had
little
to
say
she
left
the
table
before
the
others
were
through
when
betty
went
to
her
room
for
the
study
hour
she
found
lloyd
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
before
the
lamp
seemingly
so
absorbed
in
her
history
lesson
that
she
did
not
notice
the
opening
of
the
door
with
a
sigh
betty
sank
into
a
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
drew
her
arithmetic
toward
her
but
she
could
not
fix
her
mind
on
the
next
day
problems
she
was
rehearsing
a
dozen
different
ways
in
which
to
open
a
conversation
and
trying
to
screw
her
courage
to
the
point
of
beginning
while
she
hesitated
there
was
a
slight
tap
at
the
door
and
miss
edith
looked
in
it
was
her
evening
to
make
the
round
of
inspection
seeing
both
girls
apparently
absorbed
in
their
books
she
closed
the
door
and
passed
on
five
minutes
went
by
in
which
betty
kept
glancing
at
lloyd
almost
on
the
point
of
speaking
there
was
another
tap
at
the
door
and
before
either
could
call
come
ida
opened
it
and
beckoned
with
an
answering
nod
as
if
she
understood
lloyd
gathered
up
her
books
and
joined
her
in
the
hall
there
was
a
whispered
consultation
then
betty
heard
them
go
into
ida
room
and
close
the
door
feeling
that
the
breach
between
them
was
growing
wider
every
hour
and
that
lloyd
never
intended
to
be
friendly
with
her
again
betty
laid
her
head
down
on
her
arms
and
began
to
cry
not
since
she
had
lain
ill
and
neglected
in
the
bare
little
room
at
the
cuckoo
nest
the
time
she
had
the
fever
had
she
felt
so
miserable
and
lonely
not
once
in
all
the
time
since
she
had
been
at
locust
had
she
cried
like
that
with
choking
sobs
that
shook
her
whole
body
and
seemed
to
come
from
the
depths
of
her
poor
little
aching
heart
she
was
crying
so
bitterly
that
she
did
not
hear
ida
door
open
again
or
light
footsteps
go
cautiously
down
to
the
end
of
the
hall
somebody
slowly
and
carefully
slipped
back
the
bolt
that
barred
the
door
leading
to
the
outside
stairway
then
the
knob
turned
and
two
muffled
figures
stood
outside
in
the
moonlight
hurry
whispered
ida
catching
lloyd
by
the
hand
like
two
shadows
they
tiptoed
down
the
stairs
and
across
a
little
open
space
in
the
rear
of
the
kitchen
till
they
reached
the
cover
of
heavier
shadows
under
the
protecting
trees
then
they
ran
on
as
if
pursued
keeping
close
to
the
high
picket
fence
down
in
the
old
apple
orchard
in
the
far
corner
where
the
fallen
tree
lay
they
stopped
at
last
and
ida
dropped
breathlessly
to
a
seat
on
the
log
and
leaned
back
among
the
twisted
branches
there
she
exclaimed
throwing
off
the
heavy
in
which
she
had
muffled
herself
now
i
can
breathe
oh
i
been
so
upset
all
day
princess
i
felt
as
if
i
should
choke
if
i
stayed
in
that
old
building
another
minute
besides
walls
do
have
ears
sometimes
and
i
have
anybody
find
out
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
for
worlds
it
would
get
me
into
no
end
of
trouble
and
aunt
would
take
me
out
of
school
again
she
paused
a
moment
and
lloyd
waiting
expectantly
felt
the
witchery
of
the
moonlighted
night
stealing
over
her
she
had
been
confidante
often
of
late
she
knew
the
history
of
each
friendship
represented
by
each
boy
photograph
in
ida
collection
and
she
had
found
them
all
interesting
even
when
told
in
prosaic
daylight
beyond
the
shadowy
old
orchard
a
row
of
maples
gleamed
a
ghostly
silver
in
the
moonlight
and
from
the
direction
of
clovercroft
stole
the
music
of
a
violin
some
one
was
playing
schubert
serenade
it
stirred
her
strangely
will
you
promise
that
you
never
tell
a
living
breathing
soul
asked
ida
finally
in
a
low
voice
of
i
would
tell
said
lloyd
you
know
that
perfectly
well
violet
well
you
what
exclaimed
lloyd
with
such
a
start
of
astonishment
that
she
nearly
slipped
off
the
log
sh
whispered
ida
somebody
hear
us
if
you
talk
so
loud
illustration
she
turned
her
white
fingers
in
the
moonlight
feeling
as
if
a
chapter
of
some
thrilling
romance
had
suddenly
opened
before
her
lloyd
sat
up
straight
waiting
for
the
heroine
to
speak
again
the
moonlight
gave
ida
face
an
almost
unearthly
whiteness
and
there
were
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
she
had
been
crying
aunt
never
wanted
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
edwardo
she
began
in
a
low
tone
that
is
his
real
name
but
i
always
call
him
that
she
took
me
out
of
the
lexington
school
because
he
lived
near
there
she
thought
that
sending
me
down
here
would
put
an
end
to
our
correspondence
but
it
did
of
course
we
kept
on
corresponding
just
the
same
some
way
she
has
found
it
out
she
does
know
that
we
are
engaged
i
do
know
what
she
would
be
tempted
to
do
if
she
knew
she
is
angry
enough
just
about
the
letters
i
had
one
from
her
this
morning
and
i
saw
one
on
the
table
addressed
to
president
wells
in
her
handwriting
there
is
no
mistaking
it
i
am
sure
she
has
written
to
him
to
watch
my
mail
and
intercept
his
letters
i
would
have
her
get
hold
of
them
for
anything
because
she
scorns
anything
like
sentiment
she
seems
to
think
it
is
something
wicked
for
young
people
to
care
for
each
other
and
edwardo
letters
simply
devotion
in
every
word
the
faint
strains
of
the
distant
violin
swelled
louder
as
ida
held
out
her
hand
from
which
she
had
taken
all
the
rings
but
one
she
turned
her
white
fingers
in
the
moonlight
to
show
the
glimmer
of
a
pearl
he
has
told
me
so
many
times
that
that
is
what
my
life
seems
like
to
him
she
said
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
a
pearl
i
know
he
has
been
awfully
wild
and
fast
but
when
he
tells
me
that
only
my
influence
over
him
can
make
him
the
man
i
want
him
to
be
and
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
love
and
prayers
he
would
care
what
became
of
him
or
what
he
did
do
you
blame
me
for
disregarding
aunt
wishes
do
you
think
it
is
cruel
of
her
to
interfere
lloyd
listening
with
breathless
interest
to
the
friend
whom
she
loved
with
all
a
little
girl
adoring
enthusiasm
for
an
older
one
whom
she
has
taken
as
her
model
gave
a
passionate
assent
oh
i
knew
you
feel
that
way
about
it
said
ida
reaching
out
to
clasp
lloyd
hand
with
the
white
one
on
which
glimmered
the
pearl
it
is
good
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
who
can
understand
and
sympathize
an
eloquent
silence
fell
between
them
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
the
dead
leaves
and
the
wailing
voice
of
the
violin
repeating
its
plaintive
refrain
like
a
human
cry
the
music
and
the
witchery
of
the
moonlight
laid
an
spell
on
the
listening
child
till
she
felt
that
she
was
part
of
some
old
tale
in
which
ida
was
the
ladye
fair
and
edwardo
the
most
interesting
of
heroes
held
apart
by
a
cruel
fate
she
drank
in
every
word
eagerly
seeing
in
her
imagination
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
haughty
dark
face
who
stood
with
outstretched
hands
murmuring
oh
my
pearl
you
can
make
of
my
life
what
you
will
when
ida
took
a
tiny
locket
from
a
chain
around
her
neck
and
opened
it
to
show
her
his
picture
lloyd
felt
a
distinct
twinge
of
disappointment
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
face
she
had
pictured
but
ida
explained
that
it
was
not
a
good
likeness
only
a
head
cut
from
a
group
picture
in
which
he
had
been
taken
with
the
members
of
his
football
team
she
had
a
fine
photograph
of
him
in
her
trunk
but
had
to
keep
it
hidden
not
knowing
what
day
her
aunt
might
swoop
down
upon
her
for
a
visit
of
inspection
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
seen
that
face
befoah
somewhere
said
the
little
colonel
studying
it
intently
in
the
dim
light
there
was
a
familiarity
about
it
that
puzzled
her
ida
slipped
the
locket
back
and
gathered
up
her
cape
about
her
we
wo
dare
stay
here
much
longer
she
said
then
she
hesitated
princess
i
have
told
you
all
this
because
i
need
your
help
and
am
going
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
you
your
mail
does
have
to
go
through
the
principal
hands
will
you
be
willing
to
let
edwardo
address
my
letters
to
you
it
could
do
you
any
harm
simply
to
take
them
from
the
box
and
hand
them
to
me
and
it
would
make
a
world
of
difference
to
me
and
to
him
she
added
softly
if
i
were
to
refuse
to
let
him
write
to
me
as
aunt
wants
me
to
do
and
were
to
break
off
our
engagement
i
think
it
would
make
him
so
reckless
that
he
would
do
something
desperate
knowing
that
i
feel
so
responsible
for
him
princess
i
give
my
life
to
keep
him
straight
as
ida
rose
in
her
earnestness
the
tears
glistening
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
lloyd
like
some
fair
guardian
angel
and
from
that
moment
she
was
set
apart
in
her
imagination
as
if
she
had
been
a
saint
on
a
pedestal
with
such
a
noble
example
of
devotion
to
one
in
need
it
seemed
a
very
small
thing
for
lloyd
to
consent
to
the
favour
she
asked
and
she
gave
her
promise
gladly
i
shall
do
everything
i
can
to
keep
any
one
from
suspecting
that
he
is
sending
letters
to
me
through
you
said
ida
as
they
strolled
slowly
back
toward
the
house
i
ca
let
your
friendship
for
me
get
you
into
trouble
they
watch
me
very
closely
now
so
maybe
it
will
be
as
well
for
me
not
to
appear
so
intimate
with
you
as
i
have
been
we
not
come
off
here
alone
any
more
at
recess
by
and
by
when
i
feel
that
i
can
i
try
to
interest
myself
in
the
other
girls
we
still
have
our
little
confidential
meetings
just
the
same
but
no
one
must
suspect
us
i
wish
walton
would
invite
me
to
her
house
sometimes
she
said
impulsively
when
they
had
walked
a
few
minutes
in
silence
if
i
could
fill
up
a
long
letter
to
aunt
about
that
it
would
make
her
feel
that
i
was
interested
in
something
besides
edwardo
and
would
appease
her
wonderfully
i
ask
her
to
said
lloyd
eagerly
walton
told
mothah
she
intended
to
have
betty
and
me
at
the
beeches
very
often
while
she
was
away
the
first
time
she
invites
us
i
ask
her
to
have
you
too
so
kind
and
sweet
that
i
as
soon
do
it
as
not
all
she
seems
to
live
for
is
just
to
make
othah
people
happy
oh
princess
if
you
only
would
exclaimed
ida
giving
her
a
delighted
hug
aunt
would
be
so
pleased
for
it
would
be
in
all
the
home
papers
that
i
had
been
entertained
at
the
home
of
the
late
general
walton
she
would
consider
it
such
an
honour
and
feel
that
in
one
way
at
least
i
was
a
credit
to
her
aunt
thinks
so
much
of
attentions
from
distinguished
people
it
is
one
of
her
hobbies
i
would
like
to
please
her
as
much
as
possible
in
every
way
i
can
as
long
as
i
have
to
disregard
her
wishes
about
what
i
just
told
you
you
know
sh
too
near
the
house
to
talk
any
more
the
rest
of
the
way
they
slipped
along
in
silence
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
up
the
creaking
stairway
they
crept
pausing
a
moment
before
they
opened
the
door
then
they
shot
the
rusty
bolt
noiselessly
back
in
place
dropped
the
portière
and
listened
again
it
all
right
whispered
ida
giving
lloyd
hand
a
reassuring
squeeze
as
they
tiptoed
down
the
hall
oh
you
a
comfort
you
never
know
what
a
load
you
taken
off
my
mind
good
night
in
those
few
moments
of
silence
between
the
orchard
and
the
house
lloyd
thoughts
travelled
rapidly
her
quarrel
with
betty
had
faded
so
far
into
the
background
that
it
seemed
ridiculously
trivial
now
she
had
forgotten
her
grievance
in
listening
to
the
tale
of
larger
trouble
and
since
ida
had
made
it
clear
to
her
that
it
would
be
to
her
interest
to
be
friendly
with
all
the
girls
she
was
eager
to
enlist
sympathies
and
help
she
wished
fervently
that
she
could
share
her
secret
with
her
she
burst
into
the
room
her
eyes
shining
with
excitement
and
blinking
as
they
met
the
bright
lamplight
betty
was
standing
in
her
nightgown
ready
for
bed
she
saw
at
the
first
glance
that
lloyd
anger
was
over
and
she
drew
a
great
sigh
of
relief
oh
betty
began
lloyd
impetuously
i
awfully
sorry
i
made
such
a
mountain
out
of
a
this
mawning
and
got
into
a
tempah
about
what
you
said
you
were
right
aftah
all
ida
thinks
just
as
you
do
that
we
ought
to
go
off
by
ourselves
all
the
time
and
she
wants
to
be
friends
with
the
othah
girls
if
they
let
her
i
going
back
to
the
old
ways
and
try
not
to
let
anything
spoil
the
good
times
you
talked
about
ida
is
so
unhappy
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
but
i
have
any
right
what
she
told
me
was
in
confidence
but
if
you
only
knew
you
do
all
you
could
to
help
make
it
easiah
for
her
with
the
girls
i
do
anything
on
earth
you
want
me
to
exclaimed
betty
this
has
been
the
longest
miserablest
day
i
ever
spent
oh
cried
the
little
colonel
a
look
of
distress
in
her
face
then
i
spoiled
road
of
the
loving
heart
that
i
wanted
to
leave
in
yoah
memory
i
have
been
true
to
my
ring
she
looked
down
at
the
talisman
on
her
finger
the
little
lover
knot
of
gold
and
turned
it
around
regretfully
no
you
have
spoiled
anything
cried
betty
it
was
my
fault
too
you
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
and
i
always
think
of
you
that
way
let
do
say
another
word
about
that
the
best
way
to
forget
lloyd
began
undressing
and
betty
knelt
down
to
say
her
prayers
the
gong
rang
presently
for
all
lights
to
be
put
out
the
seminary
settled
itself
to
silence
then
to
sleep
but
long
after
betty
soft
regular
breathing
showed
that
she
was
in
dreamland
lloyd
lay
with
wakeful
eyes
the
moonlight
streaming
through
the
open
window
lay
in
a
white
square
on
the
floor
by
her
bed
she
heard
the
clock
in
the
hall
toll
eleven
twelve
and
one
before
she
fell
asleep
the
spell
of
the
orchard
was
still
upon
her
the
moonlight
the
faint
strains
of
music
ida
white
face
with
the
tears
in
the
violet
eyes
and
the
glimmer
of
the
pearl
on
her
white
hand
came
again
and
again
in
her
fitful
dreams
all
through
the
night
chapter
iv
the
shadow
club
lloyd
return
to
the
old
ways
came
about
so
naturally
next
morning
that
no
one
seemed
to
notice
her
sudden
desertion
of
ida
just
after
the
morning
recess
began
little
elise
walton
came
running
up
to
allison
crying
excitedly
oh
sister
give
me
your
handkerchief
quick
somebody
has
upset
a
bottle
of
ink
on
magnolia
budine
hair
and
running
all
over
everything
before
allison
could
fish
her
handkerchief
from
her
sleeve
where
she
had
thrust
it
during
recitation
lloyd
seized
a
basin
of
water
and
hurried
out
to
the
back
hall
door
there
stood
magnolia
her
head
craned
forward
like
a
turtle
as
far
as
possible
over
the
steps
to
keep
the
ink
from
dripping
on
her
dress
half
a
dozen
little
girls
were
making
excited
passes
at
it
with
handkerchiefs
and
sponges
heah
cried
lloyd
putting
the
basin
down
on
the
step
bend
ovah
magnolia
and
dip
yoah
head
in
anna
louise
you
run
and
get
anothah
basin
in
the
hall
and
marguerite
ask
some
of
the
big
girls
to
bring
a
bucket
of
watah
it
take
a
tubful
to
soak
this
out
whatever
the
little
colonel
undertook
was
thoroughly
done
and
when
magnolia
emerged
from
the
last
vigorous
rinsing
only
a
faint
green
tinge
remained
on
the
flaxen
hair
but
that
would
not
wash
off
lloyd
declared
she
had
had
a
similar
experience
herself
when
she
was
in
the
primary
grade
it
would
simply
have
to
wear
off
and
that
process
might
take
days
kitty
and
allison
with
all
the
girls
of
their
set
had
crowded
around
to
see
the
amusing
sight
offering
advice
and
laughing
all
the
time
the
performance
lasted
as
she
worked
lloyd
related
her
own
experience
rob
moore
had
tipped
the
bottle
of
ink
on
her
head
one
day
when
they
were
writing
letters
to
santa
claus
and
mom
beck
had
washed
her
hair
every
day
for
a
week
to
get
it
out
finally
turning
her
charge
over
to
the
primary
girls
with
a
couple
of
towels
and
directions
to
rub
her
dry
and
leave
her
in
the
sun
to
bleach
lloyd
led
the
way
to
the
swing
where
they
sat
laughing
and
joking
over
magnolia
accident
until
the
bell
rang
again
the
school
had
laughed
at
magnolia
from
the
first
day
when
an
old
carryall
stopped
in
front
of
the
seminary
and
she
climbed
out
with
a
huge
in
her
hand
it
was
the
most
of
an
elaborate
pattern
of
red
roses
on
each
side
and
she
was
the
most
of
little
girls
buttoned
up
in
a
bright
blue
merino
dress
with
many
gathers
in
the
full
skirt
it
was
such
a
dress
as
her
grandmother
might
have
worn
when
she
was
a
child
her
light
hair
was
drawn
back
tightly
behind
her
ears
and
braided
in
two
little
tails
she
was
fat
and
awkward
and
shy
and
so
awed
by
the
strange
surroundings
that
a
sort
of
terror
took
possession
of
her
when
she
found
herself
alone
among
so
many
unfamiliar
faces
it
was
lloyd
sherman
who
came
to
the
rescue
when
she
saw
tears
of
fright
in
the
round
blue
eyes
lloyd
had
begun
the
school
term
with
a
resolution
to
keep
true
to
the
talisman
she
wore
the
little
ring
that
was
to
remind
her
constantly
of
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
which
she
wanted
to
build
in
every
one
memory
this
was
her
first
opportunity
she
led
the
little
stranger
to
the
principal
room
and
stayed
beside
her
until
she
was
delivered
safely
into
the
matron
hands
later
it
was
lloyd
who
saw
her
in
chapel
looking
around
in
bewilderment
uncertain
where
to
go
and
beckoned
her
to
a
seat
near
her
own
and
again
at
when
somebody
tittered
at
the
unusual
name
and
the
face
was
all
afire
with
embarrassment
lloyd
friendly
smile
flashed
across
to
her
was
like
a
rope
thrown
to
a
drowning
man
and
she
could
never
forget
to
be
grateful
for
it
as
she
was
in
the
primary
department
she
could
only
worship
lloyd
from
afar
during
the
day
but
as
rooms
were
assigned
irrespective
of
classes
and
hers
was
in
the
same
wing
and
on
the
same
floor
with
lloyd
she
often
left
her
door
ajar
in
the
evening
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
pass
or
hearing
her
voice
in
the
hall
once
she
heard
ida
call
her
princess
the
name
struck
her
fancy
and
as
lloyd
was
henceforth
enshrined
in
her
adoring
little
heart
lloyd
often
caught
her
admiring
glances
in
chapel
and
several
times
found
little
offerings
in
her
desk
on
monday
mornings
when
the
old
carryall
came
back
from
the
budine
farm
with
the
little
girl
and
the
huge
there
was
an
enormous
red
apple
one
time
polished
to
the
highest
degree
of
shininess
several
ears
of
at
another
and
once
a
stiff
little
bunch
of
magenta
zinnias
and
yellow
chrysanthemums
there
was
never
any
name
left
with
them
lloyd
guessed
the
giver
but
she
did
not
realize
what
a
large
place
she
occupied
in
magnolia
affections
or
how
the
child
choked
with
embarrassment
till
she
almost
swallowed
her
whenever
lloyd
chanced
to
meet
her
in
the
hall
with
a
friendly
good
morning
let
go
down
to
the
playhouses
and
see
if
the
green
is
bleaching
out
of
magnolia
hair
proposed
lloyd
at
the
afternoon
recess
with
all
her
heartiness
and
again
the
girls
forgot
to
wonder
why
she
stayed
with
them
instead
of
wandering
off
with
ida
to
the
orchard
just
as
they
reached
the
spring
a
shout
went
up
from
the
circle
of
little
girls
gathered
around
magnolia
she
was
facing
them
defiantly
her
fat
little
face
red
with
mortification
what
the
matter
elise
asked
allison
in
a
tone
why
are
you
all
teasing
magnolia
i
not
teasing
her
cried
elise
indignantly
i
told
her
just
now
not
to
mind
anything
they
said
and
i
lend
her
my
bride
to
play
with
till
next
friday
afternoon
she
said
that
she
learned
to
read
in
a
graveyard
off
of
the
tombstones
giggled
anna
louise
and
it
seemed
so
funny
that
we
could
help
laughing
magnolia
hung
her
head
twisting
a
corner
of
her
apron
in
her
fat
little
fingers
and
wishing
that
the
earth
would
open
and
swallow
her
she
had
seen
the
amusement
in
the
little
colonel
face
and
it
hurt
worse
than
the
ridicule
of
all
the
others
combined
she
felt
that
she
must
die
of
shame
that
nothing
to
laugh
at
said
betty
seeing
the
distress
in
her
face
and
divining
what
the
child
was
suffering
i
used
to
have
lovely
times
in
the
old
graveyard
at
the
cuckoo
nest
do
you
remember
how
peaceful
and
sweet
it
was
lloyd
she
asked
turning
to
the
little
colonel
who
nodded
assent
davy
and
i
used
to
walk
up
there
every
afternoon
in
summer
to
smell
the
pinks
and
the
lilies
and
read
what
was
carved
on
the
old
stones
and
we
sit
there
in
the
grass
and
listen
to
the
redbirds
in
the
cedars
and
make
up
stories
about
all
the
people
lying
there
asleep
and
davy
learned
most
of
his
letters
there
that
the
way
it
was
at
loretta
was
it
maggie
exclaimed
elise
encouragingly
tell
them
about
it
but
maggie
hung
her
head
and
twisted
the
toes
of
her
stubby
shoes
around
in
the
dust
unable
to
say
a
word
i
tell
them
then
said
elise
turning
to
the
larger
girls
they
used
to
live
near
the
convent
at
loretta
and
one
of
their
neighbours
a
girl
lots
older
than
maggie
used
to
take
her
up
to
the
graveyard
nearly
every
day
there
was
any
place
else
to
go
you
know
and
it
was
lonesome
out
there
in
the
country
this
girl
was
named
corono
after
one
of
the
sisters
who
was
dead
she
had
been
awfully
good
to
both
their
families
when
they
were
sick
and
corono
and
maggie
used
to
make
and
crowns
out
of
the
honeysuckles
and
roses
corono
means
crown
and
put
them
on
her
grave
and
every
time
they
would
go
maggie
would
learn
a
new
letter
off
one
of
the
tombstones
and
after
awhile
she
got
so
she
could
read
how
interesting
exclaimed
lloyd
all
unconscious
of
the
way
her
words
set
maggie
heart
to
beating
with
pleasure
elise
turned
toward
her
with
a
motherly
air
that
seemed
very
funny
considering
that
she
was
smaller
than
the
child
whom
she
was
championing
so
valiantly
i
going
to
ask
them
about
that
album
right
now
maggie
you
run
back
to
school
and
get
it
glad
of
any
excuse
to
make
her
escape
maggie
started
off
to
the
house
as
fast
as
her
fat
little
legs
would
carry
her
deprived
of
their
sport
the
smaller
girls
returned
to
their
playhouses
and
the
older
ones
strolled
leisurely
back
toward
the
seminary
elise
tagged
along
beside
lloyd
and
allison
maggie
has
gone
to
get
her
she
explained
it
used
to
be
her
mother
when
she
went
to
school
at
the
convent
but
now
maggie
not
more
than
half
the
leaves
are
written
on
and
her
mother
said
she
could
use
it
if
she
be
very
careful
she
wants
you
girls
to
write
in
it
she
has
had
it
in
her
desk
for
two
weeks
trying
to
get
up
her
courage
to
ask
you
lloyd
but
she
was
afraid
you
would
laugh
i
told
her
i
was
afraid
ask
you
she
wants
all
the
big
girls
to
write
in
it
but
she
said
the
princess
echoed
lloyd
in
surprise
yes
that
what
she
calls
you
all
the
time
you
were
that
in
the
play
i
suppose
she
thinks
you
are
the
loveliest
person
she
ever
saw
and
says
if
she
could
just
look
like
you
and
be
like
you
for
one
day
she
die
happy
and
once
elise
lowered
her
voice
confidentially
she
told
me
that
when
she
says
her
prayers
every
night
she
always
prays
that
some
day
she
grow
nice
enough
for
you
to
like
her
the
poor
little
thing
cried
lloyd
much
touched
to
think
of
her
caring
like
that
you
tell
her
elise
that
of
we
all
write
in
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
elise
ran
on
after
maggie
happy
in
the
accomplishment
of
her
kindly
assumed
mission
and
presently
came
back
with
the
book
which
she
left
in
lloyd
hands
look
girls
what
a
funny
thing
it
is
cried
lloyd
turning
to
katie
mallard
who
with
betty
and
kitty
were
just
behind
them
all
the
others
came
crowding
around
also
heah
is
of
the
heart
in
gilt
lettahs
on
the
back
with
such
funny
plump
little
cupids
sitting
in
the
around
it
and
oh
see
cried
betty
glancing
over
her
shoulder
at
the
delicately
traced
names
of
the
gentle
nuns
and
the
girls
who
had
been
playmates
of
maggie
mother
in
a
past
they
are
all
dated
over
forty
years
ago
of
course
answered
katie
nobody
is
enough
nowadays
to
have
an
they
are
and
out
of
date
wait
a
minute
please
said
betty
as
lloyd
slowly
turned
the
leaves
what
is
that
verse
signed
sister
corono
oh
it
is
an
acrostic
see
the
initial
letters
of
each
line
read
downward
spell
martha
that
must
be
budine
name
several
voices
read
the
verse
in
unison
thy
life
be
ever
led
the
path
of
duty
in
deeds
of
helpfulness
fill
sad
hearts
with
beauty
shall
then
attend
thee
all
the
blessed
saints
befriend
thee
is
that
sweet
cried
betty
i
going
to
write
one
for
magnolia
there
something
pathetic
about
that
child
to
me
she
looks
so
wistful
sometimes
she
dreadfully
odd
but
it
mean
of
the
girls
to
laugh
at
her
i
do
something
extra
nice
too
said
lloyd
i
ca
write
poetry
but
i
copy
a
bar
of
music
from
one
of
the
princess
winsome
songs
i
think
notes
look
so
pretty
copied
in
pen
and
ink
i
paint
a
magnolia
blossom
in
said
allison
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
others
and
i
oh
i
draw
a
kitten
for
her
to
remember
my
name
by
said
kitty
laughing
as
both
allison
and
kitty
had
real
talent
for
drawing
the
girls
who
saw
the
pages
they
decorated
were
moved
to
envy
and
when
betty
added
an
acrostic
on
the
name
magnolia
nobody
had
a
word
of
ridicule
for
the
little
album
of
the
heart
that
was
serving
two
generations
as
a
storehouse
of
sentiment
betty
verse
was
passed
around
the
school
our
friendship
be
as
sweet
the
flower
whose
name
you
bear
days
are
fleet
others
are
half
so
fair
like
a
violet
pressed
my
name
on
this
page
long
dwell
after
years
to
recall
schoolmate
who
wished
you
well
when
the
girls
read
that
an
fever
broke
out
in
the
school
every
one
came
to
betty
for
an
acrostic
she
spent
all
her
playtime
writing
them
she
ate
all
her
meals
struggling
inwardly
with
the
hard
initials
in
such
names
as
pinkie
ursula
and
vashti
she
even
dreamed
rhymes
in
her
sleep
lloyd
copied
music
until
her
fingers
ached
for
everybody
requested
a
verse
of
a
princess
winsome
song
kitty
drew
whole
colonies
of
kittens
and
allison
finding
it
impossible
to
paint
a
flower
typical
of
each
name
presented
took
to
painting
a
single
above
her
name
the
teachers
too
suffered
from
the
epidemic
and
even
people
outside
the
school
until
the
principal
found
letters
in
the
one
morning
all
addressed
to
a
writer
of
juvenile
stories
whose
books
were
the
most
popular
in
the
school
an
investigation
proved
that
because
one
girl
had
received
his
autograph
had
followed
her
example
in
requesting
it
and
not
one
of
them
had
enclosed
a
stamp
nor
had
it
occurred
to
them
that
an
time
is
too
valuable
to
spend
in
answering
questions
merely
to
satisfy
the
idle
curiosity
of
his
readers
one
stamp
is
of
little
value
said
the
principal
but
multiply
it
by
the
hundreds
he
would
have
to
use
in
a
year
in
answering
the
letters
of
thoughtless
strangers
who
have
no
claim
on
him
in
any
way
girls
filed
out
into
the
hall
after
the
principal
little
talk
that
followed
and
slipped
their
letters
from
the
ten
of
them
threw
theirs
into
the
the
others
who
had
asked
no
questions
and
were
more
desirous
of
obtaining
their
favourite
autograph
opened
theirs
to
enclose
an
envelope
stamped
and
addressed
but
few
more
letters
of
the
kind
went
out
from
lloydsboro
seminary
after
that
kitty
katie
allison
betty
and
lloyd
all
pounced
upon
miss
edith
one
morning
before
school
each
with
an
album
in
her
hand
miss
edith
clutched
her
hair
in
mock
despair
these
make
the
seventh
dozen
i
have
been
asked
to
write
in
this
week
she
declared
life
is
too
short
to
hunt
up
a
different
sentiment
for
each
one
i
must
use
the
same
verse
for
everybody
the
girls
perched
on
the
desks
around
the
rostrum
as
she
spread
out
the
books
before
her
and
began
to
write
they
always
loved
the
few
moments
they
could
snatch
in
miss
edith
room
before
school
and
felt
that
her
autograph
would
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
in
the
collection
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
verses
said
miss
edith
as
she
passed
the
blotter
over
the
last
page
and
read
it
aloud
this
learned
i
from
the
shadow
of
a
tree
that
to
and
fro
did
sway
upon
the
wall
our
our
influence
may
fall
where
we
can
never
be
i
want
to
tell
you
a
little
incident
that
fastened
it
in
my
memory
i
have
a
friend
teaching
in
one
of
the
mountain
schools
of
kentucky
who
told
me
of
two
girls
who
came
to
the
door
one
day
asking
to
be
admitted
as
students
each
carried
a
bundle
of
clothes
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
that
was
all
they
had
no
money
to
pay
their
tuition
no
way
of
paying
their
board
unless
they
were
allowed
to
work
for
it
they
had
walked
forty
miles
to
get
to
that
school
their
home
was
twice
the
distance
away
but
their
uncle
who
was
a
tin
pedlar
took
them
in
his
wagon
they
were
a
week
on
the
road
after
they
left
him
where
his
route
branched
off
from
theirs
they
stopped
at
night
in
some
village
or
farmhouse
to
which
he
directed
them
nobody
had
the
heart
to
tell
them
that
there
was
no
room
for
students
who
could
not
pay
their
way
neither
could
any
one
turn
away
such
ambition
but
the
school
was
poor
it
is
kept
up
by
donations
from
benevolent
people
and
it
was
only
by
great
that
the
teachers
could
take
them
at
all
the
following
vacation
while
i
was
at
the
i
had
a
letter
from
this
friend
and
happened
to
speak
of
it
and
the
two
girls
to
a
wealthy
lady
whom
i
met
there
she
seemed
so
interested
that
i
read
her
my
friend
letters
they
were
so
full
of
the
struggles
and
hardships
of
those
mountain
people
that
she
was
greatly
interested
and
touched
and
began
corresponding
with
the
principal
of
the
school
herself
the
outcome
of
it
was
that
she
sent
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
to
endow
scholarships
of
course
these
two
girls
were
the
first
to
be
benefited
by
the
gift
and
next
june
they
will
be
graduated
from
the
school
with
honour
fitted
to
become
teachers
themselves
far
in
advance
of
the
time
it
would
have
taken
had
they
been
obliged
to
work
their
way
through
instead
of
plodding
along
using
the
greater
part
of
their
time
and
strength
in
laundry
work
or
sewing
they
could
go
on
with
the
college
course
uninterrupted
they
are
going
to
start
a
school
themselves
in
the
mountains
nearer
their
own
home
now
that
lady
never
saw
those
girls
and
they
were
as
unconscious
that
their
influence
was
touching
a
life
a
thousand
miles
away
as
that
tree
out
yonder
throwing
its
shadow
across
on
the
clovercroft
lawn
they
simply
stood
in
their
places
and
reached
out
as
far
as
they
possibly
could
after
what
was
good
and
high
and
worthy
in
life
but
for
years
and
years
to
come
students
who
profit
by
that
endowment
will
be
grateful
for
the
shadow
cast
by
those
two
ambitious
girls
miss
edith
never
preached
she
did
not
go
on
to
tell
them
as
miss
mccannister
would
have
done
that
they
were
responsible
not
only
for
the
influence
of
their
daily
living
upon
others
but
for
the
effect
their
might
cast
on
others
far
beyond
their
reach
she
only
pointed
to
the
flaming
red
leaves
of
a
outside
the
window
and
the
shadow
swaying
partly
on
the
high
picket
fence
and
partly
across
the
clovercroft
lawn
then
passed
the
albums
back
with
a
smile
then
the
girls
filed
slowly
out
to
chapel
it
was
a
warm
october
day
and
as
allison
took
her
seat
by
an
open
window
in
the
history
class
an
hour
later
she
found
it
hard
to
fix
her
thoughts
on
the
old
french
and
indian
wars
it
was
so
much
pleasanter
to
look
with
dreamy
eyes
through
the
haze
of
the
indian
summer
which
mom
beck
said
was
the
from
the
of
old
dead
and
gone
chieftains
she
watched
the
slow
fluttering
to
earth
of
the
pale
yellow
maple
leaves
and
listened
to
the
soft
rustling
of
the
gorgeous
red
leaves
on
the
to
which
miss
edith
had
pointed
once
or
twice
she
started
recalling
her
thoughts
to
the
history
lesson
with
an
effort
as
she
remembered
the
girls
who
were
hungry
enough
for
an
education
to
walk
forty
miles
for
it
and
work
for
their
board
she
thought
vaguely
how
eagerly
they
would
have
improved
their
opportunities
had
they
been
in
her
place
they
would
have
taken
a
lively
interest
in
the
old
wars
instead
of
sitting
in
idle
all
at
once
as
allison
watched
the
swaying
of
the
shadow
on
the
fence
and
lawn
a
thought
came
to
her
that
made
her
seize
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
writing
notes
was
forbidden
in
miss
classes
but
allison
could
not
wait
until
recess
to
share
her
brilliant
thought
with
lloyd
with
her
big
eyes
fixed
innocently
on
miss
fishy
ones
she
scribbled
slowly
on
the
paper
without
once
looking
down
form
a
shadow
club
with
miss
edith
verse
for
a
motto
it
took
much
manoeuvring
to
succeed
in
passing
the
slip
of
paper
to
lloyd
who
sat
several
seats
in
front
when
it
finally
reached
her
she
did
not
dare
turn
round
to
nod
a
pleased
assent
but
allison
knew
that
her
suggestion
was
received
favourably
for
lloyd
hand
at
once
went
up
to
readjust
the
bow
at
the
back
of
her
hair
and
two
fingers
wagged
violently
for
an
instant
out
of
miss
bina
sight
had
it
been
her
thumb
allison
would
have
interpreted
the
signal
to
mean
no
but
from
the
rapid
wagging
of
the
two
fingers
she
knew
that
lloyd
was
much
pleased
with
the
idea
allison
plan
as
she
outlined
it
to
betty
lloyd
and
kitty
at
recess
in
one
of
the
swings
was
to
form
a
club
that
should
be
not
only
fun
for
themselves
but
of
some
real
benefit
to
the
girls
of
the
mountain
districts
the
christmas
before
the
little
circle
of
busy
bees
to
which
elise
belonged
had
sent
two
barrels
of
clothes
and
toys
to
them
under
clelling
supervision
she
had
organized
the
circle
and
was
deeply
interested
in
the
work
now
allison
proposed
that
the
club
should
earn
money
for
the
same
purpose
she
grew
quite
enthusiastic
planning
the
fair
they
could
hold
in
the
spring
kitty
and
i
could
paint
calendars
and
sachets
and
paper
dolls
you
know
lloyd
and
you
and
betty
could
embroider
things
katie
mallard
crochets
the
cunningest
little
you
ever
saw
suggested
kitty
of
course
we
have
her
in
it
a
warm
glow
came
into
the
little
colonel
heart
here
was
her
chance
to
do
something
for
ida
let
have
just
a
little
bit
of
a
club
she
urged
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
if
we
begin
to
invite
generally
it
impossible
to
draw
the
line
where
we
can
stop
we
ca
ask
all
the
school
for
if
we
have
refreshments
for
so
many
each
meeting
will
be
like
giving
a
big
but
half
a
dozen
of
us
could
get
together
whenever
we
felt
like
it
and
have
the
cosiest
kind
of
a
time
with
our
without
the
rest
finding
it
out
then
nobody
would
feel
hurt
here
four
of
us
to
begin
with
said
kitty
and
if
we
have
katie
there
five
shall
you
ask
corinne
i
wish
we
could
said
betty
but
that
would
leave
margery
out
and
it
would
never
do
to
ask
them
and
not
have
anna
louise
and
marguerite
it
must
be
all
or
none
in
that
crowd
i
wish
you
all
would
be
willing
to
ask
ida
said
lloyd
imploringly
she
does
such
beautiful
and
that
brings
better
prices
than
anything
we
can
make
i
am
sure
i
willing
said
betty
cordially
i
have
no
objection
said
allison
remembering
the
pleasant
things
ida
had
said
about
her
and
kitty
who
cared
little
who
was
in
the
club
or
out
of
it
so
long
as
she
had
katie
mallard
echoed
her
consent
as
it
is
a
shadow
club
we
keep
dark
about
it
said
kitty
the
girls
need
never
know
we
formed
one
we
ought
to
meet
in
the
dark
to
carry
out
the
idea
of
its
name
how
would
it
do
to
have
the
haunted
house
of
hartwell
hollow
for
our
mercy
no
exclaimed
lloyd
with
a
shiver
that
too
spooky
but
if
you
and
allison
and
katie
can
make
some
excuse
to
spend
the
night
at
the
seminary
some
time
we
have
a
midnight
suppah
i
think
we
might
tell
mother
and
mallard
about
the
club
said
allison
they
can
keep
a
secret
and
we
have
lots
nicer
times
and
better
refreshments
if
we
let
them
into
it
well
agreed
lloyd
but
we
must
let
a
single
girl
find
it
out
they
be
mad
as
fiah
to
be
slighted
this
way
cross
yoah
heart
and
body
now
every
one
of
you
that
you
not
breathe
it
to
a
soul
three
hands
instantly
imitated
her
solemn
gesture
we
have
the
first
meeting
at
the
beeches
said
allison
because
i
got
up
the
club
i
get
mother
to
telephone
to
the
principal
to
let
you
and
betty
and
ida
come
over
to
supper
saturday
lloyd
danced
away
to
recitation
so
happy
that
her
face
fairly
beamed
she
managed
to
spell
across
to
ida
on
her
fingers
that
the
invitation
she
had
coveted
was
hers
at
last
chapter
at
the
beeches
how
good
it
feels
to
be
free
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
as
she
pushed
open
the
high
green
picket
gate
in
front
of
the
seminary
and
held
it
ajar
for
ida
to
pass
through
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
out
on
the
road
without
a
teachah
and
a
flock
of
girls
for
a
whole
month
i
despise
the
way
we
have
to
line
up
two
by
two
and
go
through
the
valley
as
if
we
were
of
a
circus
parade
or
inmates
of
an
asylum
out
for
an
airing
ida
laughed
as
they
started
down
the
path
along
the
road
leading
to
the
beeches
it
was
one
of
those
perfect
days
in
when
it
is
easy
to
laugh
when
all
outdoors
seems
filled
to
the
brim
with
a
great
content
and
even
the
woods
and
fields
all
are
keeping
holiday
besides
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
they
were
on
their
way
to
their
first
club
meeting
this
was
their
first
appearance
together
since
the
night
of
their
stolen
visit
to
the
apple
orchard
a
week
ago
it
had
cost
lloyd
many
a
pang
to
give
up
her
intimacy
with
ida
but
she
had
never
shown
such
unselfishness
as
she
did
in
this
devotion
to
her
friend
since
interests
demanded
that
she
should
go
off
with
the
other
girls
no
matter
how
much
she
longed
to
stay
she
went
obediently
although
ida
no
longer
wore
her
violets
she
kept
her
room
sweet
with
fresh
bunches
of
them
although
her
name
was
constantly
in
her
thoughts
she
rarely
mentioned
it
even
to
betty
a
few
whispered
words
in
the
hall
an
adoring
glance
toward
her
now
and
then
at
the
table
was
all
she
could
snatch
in
the
daytime
she
even
allowed
the
school
to
surmise
what
it
pleased
that
ida
had
quarrelled
with
her
or
had
grown
tired
of
her
for
her
love
was
of
the
kind
that
endureth
all
things
but
every
night
she
lay
awake
living
over
that
scene
in
the
moonlit
orchard
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
she
was
making
ida
happy
and
dreaming
of
the
romance
that
she
was
helping
on
its
way
betty
had
hurried
on
up
the
road
to
call
by
for
katie
mallard
with
the
agreement
that
the
couple
which
reached
the
first
should
wait
there
for
the
other
let
cut
through
clovercroft
suggested
lloyd
marks
wo
care
and
it
is
much
shortah
that
way
the
path
below
her
will
bring
us
out
at
her
woodland
gate
just
across
the
road
from
the
depot
anything
to
get
to
the
first
agreed
ida
i
sure
that
there
be
a
letter
in
your
box
for
me
i
can
just
that
there
one
there
from
the
depot
it
was
but
a
few
steps
to
the
one
had
only
to
cross
the
road
pass
the
country
store
and
stroll
a
short
distance
along
the
shady
avenue
there
it
sat
by
the
wayside
a
little
box
of
a
room
that
always
made
lloyd
think
of
a
for
the
first
time
she
had
been
taken
there
her
grandfather
had
explained
that
all
the
little
square
places
where
miss
mattie
was
putting
the
letters
were
pigeonholes
presently
when
miss
mattie
opened
the
window
and
handed
him
a
letter
from
one
of
those
places
she
cried
out
with
a
little
squeal
of
delight
which
made
every
one
smile
oh
white
pigeon
wing
flied
out
you
grandfathah
afterward
it
grew
to
be
a
byword
that
they
always
used
between
themselves
when
one
carried
home
a
letter
for
the
other
pigeon
wing
for
grandpa
baby
he
would
call
fondly
even
when
she
had
grown
to
be
a
tall
girl
and
white
pigeon
wing
flied
out
fo
you
grandfathah
deah
was
the
cry
if
she
were
the
bearer
of
the
missive
from
the
door
looking
across
the
road
to
a
grassy
ridge
beyond
one
could
see
the
big
inn
that
the
year
before
had
been
turned
into
a
home
for
old
confederate
soldiers
farther
on
was
the
wide
green
slope
of
the
churchyard
and
the
little
stone
church
with
its
belfry
the
manse
stood
just
behind
it
next
to
that
was
the
cottage
with
the
high
green
gables
and
where
the
waltons
had
lived
one
summer
while
their
new
house
was
being
built
and
next
to
the
cottage
was
the
new
house
itself
set
away
back
in
the
great
grove
of
trees
which
gave
to
the
place
the
name
of
the
beeches
ida
stood
outside
the
door
while
lloyd
went
in
for
the
mail
she
was
afraid
that
miss
mattie
might
suspect
that
she
had
an
interest
in
the
letters
if
she
went
in
too
so
she
busied
herself
in
looking
for
clovers
along
the
path
she
could
not
have
seen
one
however
had
they
been
growing
on
every
she
was
in
such
a
nervous
flutter
of
expectancy
when
lloyd
came
out
with
two
letters
in
her
hand
her
face
flushed
crimson
at
sight
of
the
familiar
handwriting
on
one
envelope
this
is
mine
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
tone
snatching
it
eagerly
let
sit
down
here
on
the
step
while
i
read
it
i
mighty
glad
it
was
the
only
one
said
lloyd
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
miss
mattie
still
stood
at
the
peeping
through
the
glass
which
covered
the
partition
wall
of
pigeonholes
lloyd
saw
that
she
had
gone
back
to
her
desk
by
the
rear
window
so
she
continued
in
a
low
tone
suppose
that
had
been
the
only
letter
and
betty
had
asked
me
if
i
got
one
you
would
have
said
no
of
course
said
ida
looking
up
from
the
page
impatient
at
the
interruption
this
is
not
for
you
but
it
is
addressed
to
me
persisted
lloyd
suppose
miss
mattie
heard
me
say
no
to
such
a
question
or
that
betty
saw
me
take
it
out
of
the
box
again
ida
looked
up
impatiently
but
seeing
the
distressed
expression
of
lloyd
face
said
soothingly
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
princess
it
has
just
occurred
to
you
that
your
helping
me
to
carry
on
this
correspondence
under
cover
of
your
name
seems
a
little
bit
underhanded
but
if
you
could
just
read
this
letter
you
never
be
troubled
by
such
a
thought
again
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
am
carrying
out
the
motto
of
our
club
in
the
very
highest
way
possible
our
influence
may
fall
where
we
can
never
be
she
quoted
softly
looking
dreamily
away
toward
the
belfry
i
can
not
be
with
edwardo
but
at
least
half
of
this
letter
is
taken
up
with
telling
me
how
much
my
letters
have
helped
and
influenced
him
that
the
thought
of
me
off
here
true
to
him
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
done
to
separate
us
is
keeping
him
straight
as
nothing
else
could
do
somehow
it
seems
a
good
omen
for
the
club
that
i
should
get
such
a
letter
on
my
way
to
the
first
meeting
ida
manner
was
convincing
and
lloyd
face
brightened
as
she
listened
but
she
breathed
more
freely
when
she
saw
the
envelope
bearing
her
name
torn
into
little
bits
too
small
to
tell
tales
and
dropped
down
the
crack
behind
the
doorstep
betty
and
katie
joined
them
presently
and
two
by
two
they
rustled
along
through
the
fallen
leaves
which
filled
the
path
to
the
beeches
long
before
three
the
six
members
of
the
shadow
club
were
assembled
around
the
big
table
in
the
with
their
materials
spread
out
for
walton
inspection
piles
of
brightly
coloured
embroidery
silks
zephyr
and
ribbon
made
a
gay
showing
walton
entered
into
their
plans
for
the
fair
enthusiastically
as
she
helped
wind
a
skein
of
iceland
wool
for
katie
crocheting
the
beauty
of
this
club
remarked
kitty
as
she
opened
her
and
carefully
selected
a
brush
is
that
there
no
fuss
and
feathers
about
it
no
election
of
officers
no
dues
no
rules
no
tiresome
minutes
to
read
all
we
have
to
do
when
we
begin
is
to
begin
and
to
remember
our
motto
suggested
betty
to
whom
the
purpose
of
the
club
appealed
strongly
ida
has
made
something
to
help
us
do
that
said
lloyd
give
them
to
us
now
ida
while
walton
is
here
to
see
them
please
she
urged
ida
who
had
delayed
showing
them
for
that
very
reason
glanced
shyly
toward
her
hostess
and
then
hesitatingly
opened
the
case
which
held
her
pyrography
outfit
it
only
some
little
for
your
she
said
with
a
blush
it
seems
to
me
that
the
verse
is
especially
appropriate
at
time
when
we
consciously
cast
our
where
we
can
not
be
there
was
a
chorus
of
delighted
exclamations
as
she
passed
the
packages
around
only
two
narrow
slips
of
white
held
together
by
a
white
silken
cord
but
the
cover
was
of
soft
gray
kid
on
which
she
had
burned
with
her
pyrography
needle
the
club
motto
in
old
english
letters
walton
leaned
over
the
table
to
read
the
one
on
allison
learned
i
from
the
shadow
of
a
tree
that
to
and
fro
did
sway
upon
a
wall
our
our
influence
may
fall
where
we
can
never
it
is
beautifully
done
my
dear
she
exclaimed
smiling
down
into
the
shy
violet
eyes
raised
gratefully
to
hers
in
acknowledgment
of
her
lavish
praise
the
club
is
certainly
to
be
congratulated
on
having
a
member
who
can
not
only
make
such
pretty
things
but
who
can
think
of
such
sweet
suggestive
ways
in
which
to
keep
its
purpose
always
in
view
lloyd
hand
groping
along
under
the
table
found
ida
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
of
sympathetic
delight
there
something
to
write
to
your
aunt
she
whispered
while
the
girls
were
still
admiring
their
blotters
the
maid
came
in
to
announce
a
visitor
for
walton
in
the
library
several
minutes
after
she
had
left
them
to
themselves
kitty
exclaimed
oh
mamma
forgot
to
give
me
those
little
brass
clamps
to
fasten
the
and
now
she
has
company
and
i
have
the
faintest
idea
where
to
look
for
them
they
may
be
in
the
drawer
in
the
hall
suggested
allison
i
think
i
saw
them
in
there
this
morning
but
i
am
not
sure
kitty
skipped
out
of
the
room
to
look
for
them
and
a
few
minutes
later
came
back
her
black
eyes
shining
teasingly
i
have
a
for
you
ida
she
said
mallard
is
in
the
library
discussing
our
club
and
i
heard
mother
say
something
awfully
nice
about
you
tell
it
demanded
lloyd
no
i
said
a
oh
fishing
for
a
compliment
sang
katie
do
tell
her
ida
even
if
you
have
heard
one
it
will
make
her
vain
besides
put
in
allison
miss
bina
mccannister
said
it
was
common
and
silly
to
play
oh
bother
old
miss
bina
said
the
disrespectful
kitty
well
tell
you
anyhow
i
heard
mother
tell
mallard
that
she
thought
you
were
a
charming
girl
one
of
the
sweetest
that
she
had
met
in
a
long
time
she
said
she
was
glad
we
had
chosen
you
in
the
club
instead
of
a
younger
girl
for
she
thought
you
would
have
a
quieting
refining
influence
on
us
especially
think
of
that
now
me
and
she
said
on
that
account
she
would
like
to
have
you
here
often
again
lloyd
hand
met
ida
under
the
table
in
a
quick
squeeze
something
else
to
write
to
your
aunt
she
whispered
several
pretty
two
doll
caps
and
three
calendars
in
were
laid
aside
finished
as
the
result
of
that
afternoon
work
besides
lloyd
and
betty
had
each
made
considerable
progress
on
the
centrepieces
they
had
undertaken
to
embroider
and
the
ida
was
burning
in
an
elaborate
design
of
dragons
was
allison
packed
the
finished
articles
away
in
a
after
supper
and
put
them
up
on
a
shelf
in
her
closet
our
first
meeting
has
surely
been
a
success
she
exclaimed
at
this
rate
we
have
enough
things
made
by
easter
to
hold
a
splendid
big
fair
we
ought
to
be
able
to
cast
our
shadows
quite
a
distance
with
the
money
we
make
if
we
do
this
well
every
time
come
cast
your
shadows
on
this
sheet
girls
called
walton
from
the
next
room
where
she
had
pinned
some
strips
of
white
paper
to
a
sheet
hung
on
the
wall
and
placed
a
lamp
at
the
proper
distance
for
making
silhouettes
the
name
of
your
club
suggested
an
old
amusement
of
ours
come
see
how
clever
you
are
at
drawing
each
other
shadows
it
proved
to
be
an
amusing
undertaking
for
whenever
they
laughed
during
the
process
it
changed
their
profiles
into
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
outlines
but
finally
some
very
creditable
silhouettes
were
made
and
each
member
of
the
club
carried
home
her
own
shadow
as
a
souvenir
of
the
first
meeting
katie
father
called
for
her
at
eight
and
escorted
the
seminary
girls
as
far
as
the
high
green
gate
what
a
perfectly
lovely
time
we
had
exclaimed
betty
as
she
and
lloyd
and
ida
strolled
slowly
on
toward
the
house
when
they
had
bidden
katie
and
mallard
good
night
and
what
a
delicious
suppah
we
had
sighed
lloyd
oh
if
we
could
only
have
shaded
candles
and
pretty
silvah
and
flowahs
at
i
so
tiahed
of
that
long
bare
table
everything
tasted
so
good
those
deah
little
beaten
biscuit
made
me
homesick
i
have
had
any
since
i
left
locust
the
club
is
certainly
an
inspiration
to
do
something
and
be
something
worth
while
said
betty
what
walton
said
at
supper
and
afterward
when
she
was
showing
us
the
general
sword
made
me
feel
that
way
somehow
the
world
seems
so
much
lovelier
to
be
in
than
ever
it
did
before
so
full
of
opportunities
when
one
little
person
can
cast
such
a
tremendously
long
shadow
she
looked
back
at
hers
stretching
down
the
path
behind
her
in
the
light
from
the
hall
lamp
till
it
seemed
the
length
of
a
giant
they
passed
on
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
together
as
betty
went
ahead
to
light
the
lamp
in
their
room
ida
caught
lloyd
impetuously
around
the
waist
and
gave
her
a
grateful
hug
oh
princess
she
exclaimed
i
had
such
a
happy
day
and
i
owe
it
all
to
you
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
have
had
neither
the
visit
to
the
beeches
nor
edwardo
letter
you
a
comfort
chapter
vi
uninvited
guests
this
is
the
last
day
of
october
announced
betty
one
morning
tearing
a
leaf
from
the
calendar
as
was
her
habit
as
soon
as
she
finished
dressing
will
be
do
you
realize
answered
lloyd
that
we
have
been
at
school
six
whole
weeks
without
doing
a
single
thing
we
had
planned
we
have
been
painfully
good
yestahday
when
i
passed
the
where
professah
steinwig
was
giving
a
violin
lesson
i
heard
him
say
you
must
let
down
der
strings
when
you
have
feenish
playing
if
you
keep
him
keyed
to
von
high
pitch
alway
some
day
bif
he
go
break
that
just
the
way
i
feel
this
morning
that
i
been
thinking
so
much
about
my
and
the
work
we
undehtaken
for
the
mountain
people
that
it
kept
me
keyed
up
to
too
high
a
pitch
of
goodness
i
got
to
let
down
and
get
into
some
sort
of
mischief
or
bif
i
go
break
betty
laughed
maybe
the
changes
in
the
atmosphere
affect
people
as
well
as
and
it
is
because
it
and
witches
are
in
the
air
that
you
feel
so
it
may
have
been
that
the
faculty
were
of
betty
opinion
and
felt
the
spell
lurking
in
the
atmosphere
warned
by
some
mysterious
pricking
of
the
thumbs
of
coming
wickedness
they
sought
to
avert
it
it
was
announced
at
breakfast
that
the
usual
rules
would
be
suspended
that
night
and
that
from
seven
until
eleven
the
resident
pupils
would
be
at
liberty
to
observe
the
customs
of
anywhere
in
the
building
and
that
a
spread
of
nuts
gingerbread
and
apples
would
be
furnished
in
the
gymnasium
headed
off
again
exclaimed
one
of
the
larger
girls
who
sat
near
lloyd
it
good
of
them
to
grant
us
such
privileges
but
we
wo
have
half
the
fun
that
we
could
have
had
if
they
had
put
us
on
our
honour
this
way
i
had
planned
to
slip
out
and
go
over
to
julia
some
of
the
cadets
from
the
lyndon
military
school
are
coming
up
i
would
have
hesitated
a
moment
if
they
had
shut
down
on
our
having
some
fun
here
but
now
they
treated
us
so
handsomely
even
to
furnishing
a
spread
of
course
i
ca
go
is
stupid
with
just
a
lot
of
girls
the
same
old
set
we
been
going
with
straight
along
we
might
have
a
masquerade
suggested
susie
figgs
that
would
make
us
feel
as
if
we
were
meeting
strangers
the
suggestion
ran
along
the
table
like
and
was
so
enthusiastically
received
that
susie
felt
herself
a
public
benefactor
and
beamed
with
importance
the
rest
of
the
day
oh
what
shall
go
as
was
the
despairing
question
immediately
heard
in
every
quarter
for
the
time
was
short
in
which
to
improvise
costumes
the
matron
was
besieged
by
distracted
borrowers
with
requests
for
everything
from
a
blanket
for
pocahontas
to
a
sunshade
and
for
mistress
mary
quite
contrary
lloyd
costume
cost
her
little
trouble
aside
from
borrowing
a
horn
from
one
of
the
children
in
the
neighbourhood
for
mom
beck
coming
in
with
the
laundry
before
school
volunteered
her
services
in
an
old
chest
in
the
at
locust
were
many
odds
and
ends
left
over
from
private
theatricals
and
occasions
mom
beck
remembered
an
old
blue
velvet
skirt
that
she
thought
could
be
made
into
a
suit
for
little
boy
blue
before
night
if
aunt
cindy
daughter
would
help
her
with
the
knickerbockers
and
hurried
away
to
begin
carrying
lloyd
measure
and
a
zouave
jacket
belonging
to
one
of
her
summer
suits
for
a
pattern
from
that
same
chest
came
a
dress
and
hat
which
sherman
had
worn
in
a
tableau
years
before
as
a
dresden
shepherdess
which
transformed
betty
into
the
prettiest
little
that
could
be
imagined
allison
and
kitty
taking
advantage
of
the
relaxed
rules
slipped
up
the
stairs
before
going
home
after
school
to
look
at
the
costumes
lying
spread
out
on
lloyd
bed
i
think
it
a
shame
that
day
pupils
ca
come
too
said
allison
wrathfully
we
left
out
all
around
for
we
not
old
enough
to
be
invited
to
julia
ferris
party
we
were
going
to
have
a
party
at
our
house
but
mother
and
auntie
had
to
go
to
town
to
stay
all
night
aunt
elise
is
entertaining
some
old
army
officer
wife
so
we
ca
have
any
fun
do
you
think
that
for
a
moment
exclaimed
kitty
mallard
said
that
katie
might
come
and
stay
all
night
with
us
mother
telephoned
to
her
just
before
she
started
to
town
a
daring
thought
popped
into
lloyd
mind
why
do
you
come
it
a
masquerade
you
could
slip
in
heah
to
our
room
befoah
they
unmask
and
nobody
would
evah
find
out
who
you
were
it
could
be
moah
fortunately
arranged
little
elise
is
in
town
with
yoah
mothah
and
you
could
easily
slip
away
from
barbry
and
the
cook
you
could
sleep
in
heah
with
us
and
run
home
early
in
the
mawning
befoah
anybody
was
up
unlock
the
doah
at
the
head
of
the
outside
stairs
and
you
can
sneak
in
back
way
while
we
are
at
suppah
oh
how
i
love
to
began
allison
but
i
sure
that
mother
and
mallard
would
like
it
and
now
allison
interrupted
kitty
you
know
that
nobody
ever
told
us
to
come
did
they
it
would
be
disobeying
unless
we
been
forbidden
all
sorts
of
larks
are
allowed
on
urged
lloyd
not
a
soul
outside
of
the
shadow
club
will
know
who
you
are
and
it
will
be
such
fun
to
set
everybody
to
guessing
who
you
are
and
where
you
gone
when
you
suddenly
disappear
yes
we
come
said
kitty
seizing
allison
by
the
waist
and
dancing
her
toward
the
door
i
take
the
blame
if
there
is
any
hurry
up
old
grandma
prim
we
have
to
hustle
we
barely
time
to
run
home
and
eat
our
supper
and
get
dressed
and
back
here
before
the
affair
begins
kitty
enthusiasm
like
an
energetic
young
whirlwind
swept
away
every
objection
her
sister
could
offer
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
on
their
way
home
eagerly
discussing
with
katie
mallard
what
costumes
they
could
get
ready
in
an
hour
lloyd
who
had
followed
them
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
turned
back
to
her
room
with
a
naughty
thrill
of
enjoyment
this
escapade
would
add
a
spice
of
excitement
to
the
evening
and
she
already
tingled
with
the
anticipation
of
it
there
was
a
mischievous
smile
on
her
face
as
she
walked
down
the
hall
but
it
disappeared
as
she
caught
the
muffled
sound
of
some
one
sobbing
she
stood
still
to
listen
it
seemed
to
come
from
magnolia
budine
room
the
door
of
which
stood
ajar
since
the
day
that
the
old
had
been
put
into
her
hands
lloyd
had
felt
a
peculiar
interest
in
the
child
who
prayed
every
night
that
some
day
she
might
grow
nice
enough
for
the
princess
to
like
her
she
had
showed
this
interest
by
many
little
attentions
which
kept
magnolia
in
a
flutter
of
happiness
for
hours
afterward
although
she
still
coloured
with
embarrassment
to
the
roots
of
her
flaxen
hair
when
the
princess
stooped
to
speak
to
her
she
no
longer
choked
and
swallowed
her
in
fact
she
no
longer
chewed
since
she
noticed
that
the
princess
disdained
the
habit
it
was
elise
who
confided
this
fact
to
lloyd
and
many
other
things
which
not
only
flattered
her
vanity
but
aroused
a
real
affection
for
the
ardent
little
soul
who
showed
her
admiration
by
copying
her
in
every
way
possible
she
looks
up
to
me
as
i
look
up
to
ida
thought
lloyd
i
ought
to
be
good
to
the
poor
little
thing
as
she
paused
an
instant
in
the
hall
wondering
whether
it
would
be
kinder
to
go
in
and
offer
comfort
or
to
go
away
showing
no
sign
of
having
overheard
her
sobs
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
what
was
the
cause
of
magnolia
grief
probably
she
had
no
costume
for
the
masquerade
nothing
the
huge
held
could
be
made
into
one
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
and
she
felt
left
out
of
the
frolic
lloyd
hesitated
no
longer
the
next
moment
she
was
wiping
magnolia
eyes
and
restoring
her
to
her
usual
blushing
cheerfulness
i
tell
you
what
we
do
she
said
we
run
over
to
clovercroft
and
ask
miss
katherine
to
lend
us
something
i
have
to
go
anyhow
to
borrow
a
horn
marks
told
me
that
i
could
have
one
that
buddy
left
there
last
summah
he
one
of
her
grandchildren
miss
katherine
is
an
artist
she
has
a
great
big
camera
in
her
studio
and
takes
bettah
pictuahs
than
any
professional
photographah
could
because
she
thinks
of
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
to
pose
people
for
she
gets
a
medal
or
a
prize
every
time
she
places
a
pictuah
on
exhibition
and
i
suah
she
can
think
of
something
for
you
to
be
in
such
a
state
of
rapture
that
she
felt
she
must
be
dreaming
magnolia
followed
lloyd
to
ask
the
principal
permission
to
go
over
to
clovercroft
i
know
a
place
where
there
are
two
pickets
loose
said
lloyd
as
they
hurried
across
the
lawn
if
you
can
squeeze
through
the
fence
save
time
every
minute
is
precious
now
breathless
and
panting
from
their
run
the
children
reached
the
side
door
just
as
the
coloured
man
opened
it
on
his
way
out
for
an
armful
of
wood
frazer
we
want
to
see
miss
katherine
announced
lloyd
who
was
enough
at
home
at
clovercroft
to
know
all
the
servants
she
in
the
miss
lloyd
he
answered
you
all
kin
walk
right
in
is
there
any
company
there
we
want
to
see
her
alone
said
lloyd
with
a
dignified
air
that
made
magnolia
look
at
her
admiringly
no
jes
she
an
her
maw
listenin
to
miss
flora
play
he
held
the
door
open
for
them
to
enter
and
motioned
toward
the
door
which
stood
ajar
a
bright
fire
blazed
on
the
white
tiled
hearth
on
one
side
sat
a
gentle
lady
in
black
buddy
grandmother
thought
magnolia
as
she
noticed
her
gray
hair
on
the
other
side
on
a
low
stool
with
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knees
sat
miss
katherine
looking
into
the
embers
the
firelight
shone
on
her
red
dress
and
cast
a
rosy
glow
to
every
part
of
the
cheerful
room
both
were
listening
so
intently
to
the
soft
nocturne
that
miss
flora
was
playing
that
knock
made
them
start
with
surprise
well
well
it
the
little
colonel
exclaimed
the
lady
in
black
holding
out
her
hand
to
welcome
her
come
up
to
the
fire
my
dear
both
of
you
she
smiled
reassuringly
at
magnolia
who
leaned
against
a
chair
by
the
door
staring
around
her
with
big
blue
eyes
like
a
frightened
kitten
lloyd
plunged
into
her
story
at
once
for
the
time
was
too
short
to
stand
on
ceremony
at
the
mention
of
costumes
miss
katherine
was
all
attention
and
turned
to
magnolia
with
critical
interest
suppose
you
take
her
hair
out
of
those
tight
little
tails
she
suggested
and
let
me
see
how
long
it
is
lloyd
obeyed
instantly
and
the
soft
light
hair
released
from
its
plaits
stood
out
in
a
short
frizzy
crop
reaching
only
a
little
below
her
collar
it
was
very
becoming
lloyd
was
amazed
at
the
change
it
made
in
the
child
appearance
the
very
thing
i
want
for
my
knave
of
hearts
cried
miss
katherine
clasping
her
hands
enthusiastically
and
turning
toward
her
mother
i
am
illustrating
that
old
jingle
about
the
queen
of
hearts
who
made
some
tarts
upon
a
summer
day
i
a
lovely
picture
for
the
queen
but
i
have
been
able
to
find
a
suitable
boy
for
the
knave
spied
those
tarts
and
stole
them
all
away
but
there
she
stands
her
hair
is
exactly
the
right
length
and
she
so
fat
and
cute
that
if
i
can
just
get
her
to
roll
those
round
blue
eyes
the
way
i
want
them
it
will
make
a
perfect
love
of
a
picture
but
the
costume
suggested
marks
it
is
so
elaborate
and
the
time
is
short
miss
katherine
looked
at
the
clock
one
can
do
wonders
in
an
hour
she
said
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
a
moment
she
thought
intently
genius
burns
she
announced
in
a
moment
looking
up
at
her
sister
where
that
little
white
duck
suit
that
lucien
outgrew
and
left
here
one
summer
i
saved
it
for
just
such
an
emergency
i
sure
it
will
fit
her
packed
away
in
the
answered
miss
flora
i
know
just
where
to
put
my
hand
on
it
though
is
there
anything
else
you
want
while
i
am
up
there
yes
some
scraps
of
red
velvet
if
there
are
any
left
in
the
i
have
everything
else
we
need
in
the
studio
that
red
canton
flannel
i
sometimes
use
for
draping
backgrounds
will
make
a
long
flowing
cape
to
hang
from
the
back
of
his
neck
and
sweep
the
ground
behind
him
magnolia
felt
as
if
she
were
a
big
doll
as
she
was
handed
around
from
one
to
another
in
the
trying
on
process
when
miss
flora
came
back
with
the
suit
it
did
fit
her
passably
well
and
she
and
lloyd
were
set
to
work
at
once
cutting
out
dozens
of
red
velvet
hearts
makes
me
think
of
the
time
that
i
was
the
queen
of
hearts
at
valentine
and
the
old
bear
that
the
boys
tied
to
the
bedpost
frightened
us
neahly
to
death
said
lloyd
snip
snip
went
both
pair
of
scissors
and
as
fast
as
the
hearts
were
cut
miss
katherine
and
miss
flora
sewed
them
on
to
the
little
white
duck
blouse
and
knickerbockers
even
marks
helped
fastening
frills
of
black
ribbon
and
great
gilt
buckles
on
some
old
red
of
buddy
it
grew
dark
while
they
worked
frazer
lighted
the
lamps
and
piled
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
lloyd
began
to
think
uneasily
that
the
would
be
ringing
at
the
seminary
soon
but
in
shorter
time
than
seemed
possible
everything
was
done
when
magnolia
was
led
to
the
long
hall
mirror
to
look
at
herself
she
was
unable
to
believe
that
what
she
saw
was
her
own
reflection
it
looked
like
some
illustration
taken
from
a
lovely
red
hearts
dotted
the
white
duck
suit
and
white
hearts
the
long
red
cape
which
trailed
gracefully
from
her
shoulders
a
funny
little
crown
copied
in
red
and
white
pasteboard
from
the
one
they
found
on
the
jack
of
hearts
in
a
deck
of
cards
rested
on
the
short
light
hair
curling
up
around
her
ears
there
were
lace
ruffles
at
her
wrists
and
a
tin
sword
at
her
side
and
in
her
outstretched
hands
a
little
borrowed
from
the
cook
turn
your
head
to
one
side
as
if
you
were
looking
over
your
shoulder
commanded
miss
katherine
and
hold
the
tart
up
high
in
front
now
lift
your
feet
and
sway
back
as
if
you
were
there
mamma
that
a
perfect
reproduction
of
the
picture
in
our
old
mother
goose
charmed
the
dropping
of
the
blue
dress
for
this
attire
changed
the
child
appearance
so
completely
that
she
looked
into
the
mirror
feeling
that
her
old
self
had
run
away
from
her
but
there
were
marks
and
miss
flora
exclaiming
how
pretty
and
the
princess
clapping
her
hands
and
fluttering
around
her
calling
out
that
she
was
perfectly
lovely
and
made
the
darlingest
little
knave
of
hearts
that
ever
was
seen
and
miss
katherine
saying
that
if
she
would
come
over
the
next
day
at
noon
she
would
take
her
photograph
no
one
had
even
called
her
pretty
before
and
she
had
never
had
her
picture
taken
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
face
lighted
up
as
she
turned
again
to
the
mirror
you
and
betty
come
over
too
said
miss
katherine
to
lloyd
as
she
buttoned
up
the
blue
dress
again
so
that
magnolia
could
go
back
to
supper
i
like
to
add
boy
blue
and
to
my
mother
goose
gallery
it
was
dark
when
lloyd
and
magnolia
squeezed
through
the
fence
again
and
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
as
lloyd
passed
the
portière
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
pushed
it
aside
and
drew
back
the
bolt
as
she
had
promised
kitty
to
do
they
had
barely
time
to
lay
their
bundles
on
magnolia
bed
when
the
rang
and
they
ran
down
to
the
lloyd
was
all
aglow
with
excitement
and
pleasure
over
the
success
of
the
last
hour
work
but
magnolia
had
shrunk
back
into
the
same
timid
little
creature
she
was
before
her
transformation
she
had
put
her
hair
back
into
the
tight
little
tails
again
before
leaving
clovercroft
so
that
her
disguise
would
be
the
more
complete
when
she
unloosed
it
and
appeared
as
the
little
knave
meantime
allison
and
kitty
hurrying
home
with
their
guest
had
delighted
norah
by
a
demand
for
early
supper
she
and
barbry
were
expecting
some
friends
from
rollington
a
little
irish
village
near
the
valley
and
would
be
glad
to
be
through
with
their
work
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
and
you
need
light
up
for
us
except
in
the
said
allison
for
we
going
straight
to
our
rooms
after
supper
and
we
do
want
to
be
disturbed
till
morning
very
well
miss
answered
barbry
who
a
woman
was
the
most
trustworthy
of
maids
walton
never
felt
any
hesitancy
in
leaving
the
children
in
her
care
and
oh
barbry
said
allison
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
is
and
they
say
the
witches
are
out
and
ghosts
rise
out
of
their
graves
what
is
that
tale
they
tell
about
a
ghost
that
used
to
be
seen
about
the
seminary
grounds
sure
an
your
mother
would
be
afther
gettin
angry
if
i
filled
your
heads
with
such
nonsense
who
said
there
was
ever
a
ghost
at
all
in
the
valley
but
after
much
teasing
barbry
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
into
telling
a
tale
that
had
been
afloat
for
years
of
the
little
woman
in
gray
who
had
once
owned
the
land
on
which
the
seminary
was
built
she
lived
all
alone
and
was
an
odd
character
her
peculiar
mode
of
living
and
the
mystery
surrounding
her
death
gave
rise
to
the
rumour
that
her
spirit
still
haunted
the
seminary
grounds
it
was
said
that
the
little
woman
never
appeared
in
public
without
a
gray
veil
and
her
wraith
was
recognized
by
the
long
gauzy
covering
floating
loosely
back
from
its
face
not
gray
but
white
as
more
becoming
a
spirit
no
sooner
had
barbry
finished
her
tale
than
allison
beckoned
the
girls
to
follow
and
led
the
way
to
the
i
thought
at
first
i
just
put
a
over
my
head
and
wrap
up
in
a
sheet
but
i
going
to
make
the
girls
think
i
the
real
article
how
will
this
do
taking
a
roll
of
cotton
from
one
of
the
shelves
she
pinned
it
over
her
hair
to
make
a
short
white
wig
powdered
her
face
till
it
was
as
white
as
the
cotton
and
over
it
all
threw
a
long
piece
of
tulle
which
she
brought
from
a
bureau
drawer
in
her
room
aunt
elise
gave
it
to
me
last
time
i
was
in
town
she
said
she
had
yards
and
yards
of
it
that
had
been
used
some
way
in
decorating
with
lilies
for
a
luncheon
wait
till
i
wrap
a
sheet
around
me
now
how
do
i
look
perfectly
awful
exclaimed
kitty
gazing
at
her
in
fascinated
wonder
that
flesh
and
blood
could
look
so
truly
katie
hid
her
eyes
with
a
little
scream
do
look
at
me
that
way
she
begged
if
you
are
this
terrifying
in
daylight
to
people
who
know
who
you
are
what
will
you
be
at
night
well
satisfied
with
the
effect
she
had
produced
allison
folded
up
the
veil
carefully
removed
the
wig
and
washed
the
powder
from
her
face
while
kitty
and
katie
rummaged
in
the
drawers
for
some
old
gingham
aprons
that
had
been
discarded
long
ago
they
had
decided
to
go
as
rag
dolls
as
that
would
be
the
most
complete
disguise
they
could
think
of
even
their
hair
would
be
covered
and
they
would
not
need
to
speak
it
will
be
terribly
hot
with
all
that
cotton
stuffed
about
our
heads
and
necks
said
katie
but
we
look
funny
and
we
must
hold
ourselves
limp
and
lean
up
against
things
or
flop
over
just
as
real
rag
dolls
do
here
are
the
aprons
cried
kitty
at
last
see
they
fit
up
close
around
the
neck
and
hide
the
place
where
the
muslin
that
covers
our
head
is
tied
on
i
paint
the
faces
on
you
the
last
thing
before
we
start
said
allison
mercy
me
allison
exclaimed
katie
we
ca
walk
down
past
the
depot
and
the
store
rigged
up
that
way
even
if
it
is
dark
somebody
might
think
we
were
escaped
freaks
and
chase
us
we
ought
to
wait
till
we
get
to
the
seminary
before
we
dress
no
there
wo
be
time
then
and
everybody
will
know
it
only
a
frolic
if
kitty
wears
her
and
you
wear
mine
and
pull
the
hoods
away
over
your
faces
nobody
will
notice
i
not
dress
till
afterward
for
i
not
going
to
appear
till
the
middle
of
the
evening
i
not
going
to
go
up
to
the
gymnasium
at
all
but
just
glide
around
on
the
outskirts
and
lay
a
cold
finger
on
some
one
now
and
then
i
get
a
lump
of
ice
out
of
the
cooler
if
i
can
manage
to
slip
into
the
now
if
you
bring
me
the
scissors
i
cut
the
muslin
and
fit
it
over
your
heads
walton
sorry
that
her
absence
would
deprive
the
girls
of
their
anticipated
party
compensated
for
their
disappointment
as
far
as
possible
by
ordering
an
unusually
delicious
little
supper
for
them
and
their
guest
is
it
too
tantalizing
exclaimed
kitty
when
barbry
had
left
the
room
for
some
hot
biscuits
here
everything
i
like
best
and
i
in
such
a
hurry
and
so
excited
that
i
can
hardly
choke
down
a
mouthful
do
talk
then
commanded
allison
just
the
meal
proceeded
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
but
the
silence
itself
grew
funny
as
they
thought
of
the
ludicrous
figures
they
would
soon
present
and
they
began
to
giggle
the
giggles
grew
into
shrieks
of
laughter
a
little
later
when
they
had
gone
and
the
two
rag
dolls
all
stuffed
painted
and
dressed
leaned
limply
against
the
wall
and
leered
at
each
other
even
their
hands
looked
comical
covered
in
white
woollen
gloves
each
finger
held
stiffly
out
from
the
other
after
one
glance
allison
rolled
on
the
bed
holding
her
sides
laughing
and
gasping
in
turn
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
exclaimed
finally
sitting
up
and
wiping
her
eyes
and
then
going
off
into
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
laughter
as
she
looked
at
them
again
i
never
saw
anything
so
funny
in
my
life
the
girls
will
simply
shriek
when
they
see
you
norah
and
barbry
sitting
over
their
own
supper
heard
the
laughing
far
down
in
the
kitchen
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
and
then
as
the
contagious
sound
continued
laughed
themselves
the
merriment
was
irresistible
but
a
little
later
busy
with
their
preparations
for
their
coming
friends
they
did
not
notice
that
the
house
grew
strangely
still
and
that
not
another
sound
came
from
the
rooms
above
all
that
evening
kitty
room
adjoined
allison
bolting
the
door
which
opened
into
her
mother
on
the
inside
she
passed
through
allison
with
katie
and
out
into
the
hall
then
allison
locked
her
door
on
the
outside
and
hid
the
key
under
the
hall
rug
creeping
down
the
stairs
they
stole
out
at
the
side
door
locked
it
after
them
and
hid
the
key
inside
a
large
on
the
porch
that
safer
than
carrying
it
said
allison
we
be
sure
to
lose
it
and
then
we
would
be
in
a
pretty
pickle
the
moon
overcast
by
shifting
clouds
was
just
beginning
to
throw
a
faint
ghostly
glimmer
over
the
valley
as
the
girls
hurried
out
let
go
back
way
until
we
are
past
grandmother
gate
said
kitty
edgewood
macintyre
place
was
just
across
from
the
beeches
and
some
one
was
strolling
up
the
avenue
toward
it
uncle
harry
whispered
allison
crouching
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
until
he
had
gone
in
rustling
along
in
the
dry
leaves
they
passed
the
rear
of
the
cottage
next
door
the
manse
and
the
little
stone
church
that
brought
them
out
into
the
wide
open
space
below
the
ridge
where
the
lights
gleamed
from
every
window
in
the
soldiers
home
the
girls
drew
their
hoods
closer
over
their
faces
as
they
hurried
across
the
churchyard
out
through
the
iron
gate
into
the
road
it
makes
me
think
of
the
night
we
had
a
party
at
the
haunted
house
of
hartwell
hollow
said
katie
looking
up
at
the
bare
branches
overhead
which
were
beginning
to
toss
in
the
rising
wind
then
she
clapped
a
hand
over
her
rag
mouth
to
choke
back
a
giggle
kitty
had
begun
holding
her
arms
in
the
aimless
fashion
peculiar
to
rag
dolls
and
was
walking
along
as
if
she
had
no
bones
for
goodness
sake
behave
yourself
begged
allison
do
get
us
to
laughing
out
here
on
the
road
kitty
straightened
up
as
they
passed
the
deserted
and
they
quickened
their
pace
until
they
were
safely
beyond
the
store
and
the
depot
a
moment
later
they
had
passed
through
the
woodland
gate
of
clovercroft
raced
along
the
path
below
the
and
were
squeezing
through
the
gap
in
the
picket
fence
to
the
seminary
grounds
they
must
be
almost
through
supper
whispered
katie
peeping
in
at
one
of
the
windows
over
which
the
blind
had
not
been
entirely
drawn
with
all
that
laughing
and
talking
they
never
hear
us
go
up
the
stairs
we
can
make
as
much
noise
as
we
please
a
dim
light
burned
in
the
upper
hall
but
no
lamp
was
lighted
in
betty
and
lloyd
room
let
not
make
any
suggested
allison
they
think
we
come
let
hide
and
see
what
they
do
when
they
suddenly
discover
us
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
sound
of
many
feet
in
the
lower
hall
then
on
the
stairs
and
an
unusual
buzz
of
voices
the
girls
were
scattering
to
their
rooms
to
dress
for
the
masquerade
hurry
gasped
allison
stooping
down
behind
a
tall
kitty
rolled
under
one
bed
and
katie
under
the
other
and
there
they
lay
waiting
trying
to
stifle
the
giggles
which
nearly
choked
them
chapter
vii
the
masquerade
i
make
a
light
said
betty
groping
across
the
room
with
a
handful
of
matches
which
she
had
taken
from
the
box
in
the
hall
lloyd
started
to
follow
but
stumbling
over
a
footstool
felt
her
way
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
it
to
wait
for
a
light
on
the
way
up
from
supper
she
had
started
to
repeat
a
funny
story
which
she
had
heard
at
clovercroft
that
afternoon
and
she
kept
on
with
it
as
betty
having
found
her
way
to
the
table
struck
a
match
but
she
stopped
again
as
the
match
went
out
with
a
sudden
puff
as
if
a
strong
draught
had
blown
it
there
it
never
fails
to
do
that
when
i
in
a
hurry
exclaimed
betty
striking
another
match
as
she
spoke
it
was
extinguished
as
suddenly
as
the
first
she
tried
another
and
another
with
the
same
result
how
strange
she
said
wonderingly
there
is
a
window
open
anywhere
is
there
it
the
witches
declared
lloyd
laughing
there
must
be
one
standing
there
by
yoah
elbow
the
laugh
ended
in
a
piercing
shriek
as
she
felt
something
clutch
her
ankle
murdah
murdah
she
yelled
ow
there
something
awful
undah
the
bed
it
grabbed
me
by
the
foot
ow
ow
hush
up
goosey
commanded
a
familiar
voice
and
as
betty
struck
her
fifth
and
last
match
which
burned
steadily
they
saw
allison
dashing
to
the
door
to
lock
it
doors
were
opening
all
along
the
corridors
and
footsteps
hurrying
from
every
direction
in
response
to
lloyd
terrified
cry
tell
them
that
it
all
right
that
it
only
a
scare
demanded
allison
in
a
stage
whisper
do
let
them
in
i
blew
out
the
matches
and
it
only
kitty
and
katie
under
the
beds
it
all
right
called
lloyd
in
a
quavering
tone
but
the
knock
was
imperative
and
betty
beckoning
the
girls
frantically
toward
the
closet
fumbled
with
the
bolt
until
they
had
whisked
into
hiding
the
one
brief
glimpse
of
the
rag
dolls
falling
over
each
other
in
their
mad
haste
to
escape
was
so
comical
that
both
lloyd
and
betty
were
choking
with
laughter
when
the
matron
entered
they
could
hardly
control
their
voices
while
they
tried
to
tell
her
how
the
matches
had
gone
out
and
lloyd
had
imagined
that
there
were
witches
in
the
room
smiling
indulgently
at
their
foolishness
which
she
attributed
to
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
the
matron
withdrew
she
could
hear
them
still
laughing
when
she
passed
through
the
hall
again
several
minutes
later
for
the
rag
dolls
coming
out
of
the
closet
as
soon
as
she
disappeared
began
taking
one
ridiculous
pose
after
another
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
solemn
silence
in
which
they
struck
their
limp
boneless
attitudes
made
the
scene
all
the
funnier
and
as
the
girls
looked
at
the
surprised
expressions
allison
had
painted
on
the
flat
muslin
faces
they
went
into
such
hysterical
laughter
that
the
tears
streamed
down
their
faces
oh
girls
stop
begged
lloyd
finally
wiping
her
eyes
laughed
till
i
ache
and
it
time
for
me
to
dress
for
i
promised
magnolia
to
help
her
into
her
costume
katie
and
kitty
subsided
into
a
heap
on
the
divan
could
you
have
told
who
we
were
if
you
had
known
we
were
coming
asked
katie
never
in
the
world
answered
betty
i
could
tell
which
is
which
now
if
it
were
not
for
your
voices
we
not
going
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
said
katie
we
ought
to
talk
you
know
if
we
carry
out
our
part
as
it
should
be
we
slip
up
into
the
gymnasium
pretty
soon
and
be
sitting
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
when
the
others
come
up
we
lop
around
and
watch
the
fun
till
the
unmasking
begins
then
we
come
down
here
and
wait
for
the
rest
of
you
all
the
time
they
had
been
performing
allison
had
been
busy
before
the
mirror
and
now
turned
around
in
her
spectral
attire
the
ghost
of
the
veiled
lady
cried
lloyd
oh
allison
yoah
is
splendid
you
enough
to
freeze
the
blood
in
one
veins
there
could
be
anything
moah
than
that
thin
tulle
veil
i
wish
mom
beck
could
see
you
i
heard
her
talking
about
that
queah
little
woman
whose
house

where
the
seminary
cellah
is
dug
now
till
i
could
close
my
eyes
at
night
all
the
darkies
believe
she
still
haunts
the
place
betty
had
never
heard
the
story
so
allison
repeated
it
while
she
dressed
adding
you
two
must
do
all
you
can
to
spread
the
report
that
i
lurking
around
you
have
seen
me
yourself
you
know
if
i
had
my
lump
of
ice
you
soon
feel
the
touch
of
my
clammy
fingers
i
wish
you
give
me
a
piece
of
newspaper
to
wrap
it
in
betty
then
it
drip
i
wish
we
could
carry
a
lump
of
ice
around
with
us
gasped
kitty
all
this
cotton
packed
around
my
head
and
neck
makes
me
so
hot
i
can
scarcely
breathe
miss
edith
and
clelling
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
decorations
in
the
gymnasium
looked
around
well
pleased
a
score
of
grinned
sociably
from
the
brackets
between
the
windows
two
more
kept
guard
on
each
side
of
the
piano
and
at
least
a
dozen
lighted
the
long
table
stretched
across
one
end
of
the
room
on
which
the
spread
was
arranged
graceful
sprays
of
trailed
their
bright
berries
over
the
white
cloth
a
huge
piled
with
grapes
formed
the
centrepiece
a
pitcher
of
sweet
cider
stood
at
each
end
and
nuts
persimmons
balls
gingerbread
and
apples
filled
all
the
space
between
it
is
well
worth
the
trouble
said
miss
edith
lighting
the
last
candle
the
girls
will
enjoy
it
thoroughly
some
one
called
both
teachers
from
the
room
just
then
and
in
their
absence
two
uninvited
guests
who
had
been
waiting
behind
the
door
hurried
in
and
seated
themselves
on
the
floor
in
the
dimmest
corner
i
should
say
it
worth
the
trouble
whispered
one
rag
doll
to
the
other
as
they
looked
around
the
room
at
the
fantastic
decorations
it
lots
more
fun
coming
here
this
way
than
having
the
party
at
home
and
it
more
fun
than
if
we
been
invited
i
nearly
roasted
panted
the
other
one
but
i
glad
i
here
oh
how
pretty
it
was
the
entrance
of
one
of
the
older
girls
in
court
train
and
powdered
hair
that
caused
the
exclamation
and
while
they
were
trying
to
guess
who
it
could
be
the
others
began
to
arrive
old
king
cole
and
pocahontas
came
in
arm
in
arm
followed
by
red
riding
hood
and
a
brownie
while
puss
in
boots
proudly
escorted
aladdin
with
his
lamp
little
and
boy
blue
were
soon
recognized
for
betty
had
made
no
attempt
to
hide
the
brown
curls
which
helped
to
make
her
such
a
pretty
little
dresden
shepherdess
and
while
lloyd
had
gathered
up
her
long
light
hair
under
the
hat
with
its
blue
ribbon
every
graceful
gesture
and
every
step
she
took
holding
herself
erect
with
a
proud
lifting
of
the
head
proclaimed
the
little
colonel
for
once
in
her
short
life
little
magnolia
budine
tasted
the
sweets
of
social
success
for
no
one
there
was
more
popular
or
more
admired
than
the
saucy
knave
of
hearts
with
the
putting
on
of
the
costume
she
had
put
on
a
courage
and
that
never
could
have
been
assumed
with
the
blue
merino
and
the
stiff
short
tails
of
hair
grasping
the
stolen
tart
firmly
in
her
chubby
hands
and
lifting
the
little
slippers
with
their
huge
bows
and
buckles
in
the
high
mincing
step
miss
katherine
had
taught
her
she
swaggered
coquettishly
up
and
down
the
room
her
red
mantle
sweeping
behind
her
wherever
she
went
a
flock
of
admiring
girls
crowded
around
her
for
many
a
month
afterward
her
red
and
white
crown
hung
over
her
mirror
not
only
as
a
souvenir
of
the
jolly
revel
but
as
a
token
that
for
one
night
at
least
she
had
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
princess
not
only
had
lloyd
circled
around
her
when
she
was
dressed
exclaiming
again
that
she
looked
perfectly
lovely
but
when
they
chose
partners
for
the
to
march
solemnly
through
the
halls
to
the
slow
music
of
the
dead
march
the
princess
had
chosen
her
lloyd
had
looked
around
for
ida
who
had
come
as
a
puritan
maid
but
the
cap
and
kerchief
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
had
evidently
grown
tired
of
the
affair
and
gone
to
her
room
illustration
little
knave
must
be
my
partner
magnolia
did
not
know
that
she
was
second
choice
her
cup
of
happiness
was
overflowing
when
boy
blue
turned
away
from
aladdin
and
red
riding
hood
who
were
both
trying
to
claim
her
and
said
no
this
little
knave
must
be
my
partner
he
has
stolen
my
heart
as
well
as
the
tarts
in
their
corner
near
the
piano
kitty
and
katie
sat
stiffly
against
the
wall
seemingly
incapable
of
moving
themselves
several
times
some
of
the
larger
girls
made
an
attempt
to
lift
them
and
in
whatever
position
they
fell
when
they
were
dropped
they
lay
with
hands
thrust
out
and
heads
lolling
to
one
side
there
was
a
laughing
crowd
around
them
continually
oh
my
country
gasped
katie
as
the
first
solemn
chords
of
the
dead
march
struck
her
ear
and
all
light
in
the
room
was
suddenly
extinguished
except
what
gleamed
from
the
eyes
and
mouths
of
the
they
gone
and
dragged
in
old
sally
the
skeleton
it
bad
enough
to
hear
her
bones
rattle
in
the
physiology
class
in
the
daytime
but
this
is
more
than
i
bargained
for
now
is
the
time
for
us
to
go
whispered
kitty
they
unmask
soon
we
seen
how
they
all
look
and
set
them
to
guessing
and
we
better
miss
the
refreshments
than
run
the
risk
of
being
discovered
katie
eyed
the
table
wishfully
it
seems
a
pity
to
miss
all
that
spread
could
we
creep
around
the
wall
to
the
far
side
and
slip
something
into
our
apron
pockets
the
cloth
is
so
long
it
would
hide
us
what
to
hinder
our
getting
under
the
table
and
staying
through
the
whole
performance
suggested
kitty
the
cloth
comes
nearly
to
the
floor
and
i
do
believe
anybody
would
think
of
looking
under
it
then
we
could
hear
them
wonder
who
we
are
and
where
we
disappeared
to
when
they
unmask
and
we
are
missing
quick
then
while
their
backs
are
turned
exclaimed
katie
not
waiting
to
consider
consequences
or
means
of
escape
later
in
the
evening
slowly
solemnly
with
measured
tread
the
long
procession
filed
by
and
wheeling
to
the
music
started
back
toward
the
other
end
of
the
long
gymnasium
creeping
on
hands
and
knees
fearful
lest
some
backward
glance
might
discover
them
should
they
stand
erect
the
two
girls
like
wary
mice
scuttled
across
the
room
and
disappeared
under
the
sheltering
grown
bold
with
their
successful
venture
kitty
proposed
that
each
time
the
procession
turned
away
from
them
they
should
reach
out
and
grab
something
from
the
table
it
was
an
exciting
performance
time
after
time
as
the
motley
figures
turned
their
backs
two
ludicrous
heads
popped
up
above
the
table
and
four
white
woollen
gloves
clawed
hastily
at
different
dishes
when
the
marauders
dropped
from
sight
the
last
time
there
was
a
goodly
store
of
provisions
gathered
up
in
each
gingham
apron
i
would
have
missed
this
for
anything
giggled
katie
some
time
later
when
the
unmasking
began
and
the
girls
crowded
around
the
table
for
nuts
and
apples
with
which
to
try
their
fortunes
in
such
a
babel
of
voices
there
was
no
danger
of
being
overheard
listen
we
can
tell
from
the
different
remarks
who
every
one
represented
they
whispered
to
each
other
oh
evelyn
ward
i
knew
all
the
time
that
you
were
the
court
lady
i
recognized
your
rings
that
what
fooled
me
about
aladdin
susie
figgs
had
changed
rings
with
ada
well
i
guessed
nearly
everybody
the
first
except
those
ridiculous
rag
dolls
does
anybody
know
where
they
have
gone
that
started
the
discussion
the
two
under
the
table
had
been
waiting
for
and
the
various
guesses
falling
wide
of
the
mark
were
so
amusing
that
their
mirth
nearly
betrayed
their
once
they
thought
their
discovery
was
certain
they
had
been
feeding
themselves
from
the
store
of
provisions
in
their
aprons
as
well
as
the
size
of
their
muslin
mouths
would
allow
the
mouths
had
been
only
small
slits
at
first
but
they
had
stretched
and
torn
them
with
their
fingers
until
they
were
large
enough
to
allow
them
to
take
a
bite
of
apple
as
they
sat
there
munching
nuts
and
kitty
whispered
we
like
the
man
in
the
verse
was
a
young
man
so
benighted
he
never
knew
when
he
was
slighted
he
went
to
a
party
and
ate
just
as
hearty
as
if
he
been
really
invited
katie
tried
hard
not
to
laugh
but
the
effort
ended
in
a
snort
and
she
almost
choked
on
a
grain
of
if
some
one
had
not
upset
a
just
then
and
started
a
wild
scramble
to
put
out
the
candle
before
it
burned
the
cloth
the
unbidden
guests
must
certainly
have
been
discovered
gradually
the
crowd
around
the
table
dwindled
away
as
little
groups
gathered
in
different
parts
of
the
room
intent
on
various
ways
of
having
eaten
all
they
could
and
not
being
able
to
hear
anything
more
of
interest
the
girls
under
the
table
began
to
grow
tired
of
their
position
moreover
the
heat
of
their
costumes
seemed
to
grow
more
unbearable
every
minute
we
in
a
trap
groaned
katie
how
we
are
ever
going
to
make
our
escape
is
kitty
never
heard
the
rest
of
the
sentence
for
half
a
dozen
girls
who
had
ventured
down
the
cellar
steps
with
candle
and
came
bursting
into
the
room
almost
hysterical
with
fright
breathless
from
their
headlong
race
up
three
flights
of
stairs
they
gasped
out
their
news
in
broken
sentences
each
voice
in
a
different
key
oh
a
real
ghost
none
of
your
sheet
and
affairs
white
hair
and
a
face
like
marble
and
a
long
floating
veil
and
it
clutched
mary
phillips
with
fingers
that
were
like
the
dead
did
it
mary
no
it
did
come
out
of
the
cellar
it
just
the
most
awful
wail
as
it
vanished
the
cook
saw
it
earlier
in
the
evening
floating
away
toward
the
graveyard
not
walking
you
know
but
about
a
foot
above
the
ground
allison
has
evidently
had
as
much
fun
as
anybody
whispered
kitty
oh
will
you
listen
there
goes
lloyd
vowing
it
the
spirit
of
the
veiled
lady
and
that
she
saw
it
twice
this
evening
and
betty
too
that
will
convince
them
if
anything
could
betty
is
always
so
serious
in
the
way
she
tells
things
now
is
the
time
to
go
while
they
all
so
excited
and
in
the
other
end
of
the
room
whispered
kitty
let
make
a
wild
dash
for
the
door
nearest
us
bang
it
behind
us
and
blow
out
the
hall
light
then
we
can
slide
down
the
banister
put
out
the
light
in
the
lower
hall
and
be
safe
in
the
west
wing
before
they
come
to
their
senses
now
ready
it
was
a
daring
move
but
it
proved
successful
every
one
heard
a
scramble
and
turned
in
time
to
see
two
crouching
figures
dash
into
the
hall
they
were
too
startled
to
know
whether
they
were
human
or
not
somebody
screamed
when
the
door
banged
violently
and
mary
phillips
who
had
been
in
a
tremble
ever
since
her
flight
from
the
cellar
was
nearly
paralyzed
with
fright
she
clutched
her
nearest
neighbour
wailing
oh
what
is
it
by
the
time
matches
were
brought
and
the
lamps
were
relit
katie
and
kitty
were
safely
locked
in
lloyd
room
tearing
off
their
disguises
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
their
flushed
faces
for
a
few
minutes
they
waited
that
a
search
would
be
made
but
as
time
went
on
and
no
one
ventured
into
that
part
of
the
house
they
began
to
try
the
charms
that
they
could
not
take
part
in
when
allison
came
in
half
an
hour
later
she
found
them
whirling
apple
parings
around
their
heads
and
flinging
them
over
their
shoulders
to
see
what
initials
they
would
form
in
falling
by
the
time
allison
had
washed
the
powder
from
her
face
and
picked
the
cotton
from
her
hair
lloyd
and
betty
came
in
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
never
settle
down
enough
to
think
of
sleep
there
was
so
much
to
talk
over
allison
curled
up
on
the
divan
announcing
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
undress
as
it
would
soon
be
time
for
them
to
start
home
kitty
and
katie
followed
her
example
appropriating
lloyd
single
bed
lloyd
and
betty
took
the
other
one
and
they
lay
whispering
until
midnight
just
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
lloyd
got
up
and
lighted
a
candle
five
eggs
which
she
had
boiled
in
the
earlier
in
the
evening
lay
on
a
plate
on
the
table
the
yolks
had
been
removed
and
the
space
filled
with
salt
according
to
a
previous
agreement
each
girl
got
up
and
took
one
of
the
eggs
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
solemn
silence
they
ate
them
stoically
although
the
salt
burned
and
choked
them
then
without
a
drop
of
water
afterward
they
walked
backward
to
bed
according
to
the
charm
whatever
they
dreamed
after
that
performance
would
come
true
and
unless
they
were
to
be
old
maids
some
one
would
appear
in
their
dreams
bearing
a
cup
of
water
that
one
would
be
their
fate
none
of
the
five
slept
soundly
that
night
the
salt
made
them
thirsty
the
crowded
quarters
restless
allison
wakened
every
time
a
rooster
crowed
or
a
dog
barked
because
she
felt
that
the
responsibility
of
getting
home
before
barbry
wakened
rested
upon
her
once
when
she
was
about
to
sink
into
a
delicious
doze
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
locomotive
aroused
her
to
the
consciousness
that
the
early
was
rumbling
past
the
depot
opening
her
eyes
she
saw
that
the
gray
dawn
was
beginning
to
steal
over
the
valley
with
a
groan
she
sat
up
and
stumbled
across
the
room
to
arouse
the
others
she
had
to
shake
kitty
several
times
and
when
she
at
last
staggered
to
her
feet
she
yawningly
quoted
old
aunt
cindy
expression
that
she
was
as
tired
as
a
thousand
of
dawgs
and
vowed
she
could
never
get
home
unless
she
was
dragged
there
katie
complained
of
a
headache
and
a
miserable
after
the
ball
feeling
it
was
a
little
trio
which
finally
stumbled
down
the
back
stairs
and
out
into
the
frosty
dawn
not
a
word
was
spoken
on
the
way
home
in
silence
they
slipped
up
the
stairs
at
the
beeches
in
silence
they
undressed
and
crept
into
bed
and
three
hours
later
when
barbry
came
as
usual
to
call
them
she
knocked
half
a
dozen
times
before
she
succeeded
in
arousing
them
chapter

the
princess
of
the
pendulum
there
were
literary
exercises
in
the
chapel
the
following
friday
afternoon
it
was
the
day
for
the
reading
of
the
a
monthly
paper
to
which
all
the
grades
contributed
as
a
humourous
account
of
the
celebrated
was
to
be
one
of
the
chief
features
spiced
by
many
personal
allusions
its
appearance
was
looked
for
eagerly
little
magnolia
budine
was
the
only
one
in
the
room
impatient
for
the
exercises
to
close
she
sat
near
a
front
window
looking
out
at
every
sound
of
approaching
wheels
to
see
if
the
old
carryall
had
stopped
at
the
high
green
gate
in
front
of
the
seminary
she
had
been
hoping
all
afternoon
that
her
father
would
come
for
her
earlier
than
usual
and
she
that
he
would
the
chill
november
days
were
short
and
she
knew
that
he
would
want
to
reach
home
before
dark
it
was
not
that
she
failed
to
appreciate
the
interesting
articles
in
the
but
she
was
in
a
hurry
for
the
drive
to
be
over
the
reason
for
her
impatience
was
packed
away
in
the
old
waiting
outside
in
the
hall
unless
she
reached
home
before
dark
a
certain
pleasure
she
had
in
store
would
have
to
be
delayed
till
morning
so
intent
was
she
on
listening
for
the
sound
of
wheels
that
she
failed
to
hear
the
title
of
a
short
poem
which
one
of
the
editors
announced
as
written
by
when
elise
nudged
her
whispering
that
about
you
maggie
she
turned
with
a
start
and
blush
to
find
every
one
looking
at
her
she
was
so
confused
she
heard
only
the
last
verse
not
only
did
he
steal
the
tarts
made
by
the
gracious
queen
he
captured
all
the
schoolgirls
hearts
that
little
knave
on
the
applause
which
followed
was
loud
and
long
her
heart
gave
a
proud
glad
throb
at
this
public
compliment
but
her
face
felt
as
if
it
were
on
fire
and
she
longed
to
drop
under
her
desk
out
of
sight
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
clelling
told
her
in
a
low
tone
that
her
father
had
come
and
she
might
be
excused
how
she
ever
got
to
the
door
with
all
those
eyes
fastened
on
her
was
more
than
she
could
tell
she
felt
as
if
each
foot
weighed
a
ton
and
that
she
was
an
hour
travelling
the
short
space
snatching
her
hat
from
the
and
pinning
a
big
gray
shawl
around
her
she
caught
up
the
and
ran
down
to
the
gate
an
occasional
snowflake
like
a
downy
white
feather
floated
through
the
air
the
wind
was
raw
and
damp
and
she
was
glad
to
climb
in
behind
the
sheltering
curtains
of
the
old
carryall
and
lean
up
against
her
rough
warm
overcoat
well
puss
how
goes
it
he
asked
pulling
an
old
bedquilt
up
over
his
knees
and
tucking
it
well
around
her
daddy
she
answered
squeezing
his
arm
in
both
her
mittened
hands
and
snuggling
up
to
him
like
a
contented
kitten
i
think
now
the
nicest
school
in
the
world
and
i
like
it
better
and
better
every
day
got
a
good
report
this
week
yes
i
have
missed
a
single
word
in
spelling
clelling
had
to
show
me
nearly
two
hours
about
borrowing
in
subtraction
but
i
have
any
more
trouble
with
it
now
and
i
had
a
longer
list
of
adjectives
on
my
than
anybody
else
in
the
class
there
was
a
look
of
pride
in
the
old
farmer
face
he
had
had
little
education
himself
he
had
barely
learned
to
read
and
write
in
the
few
short
terms
he
had
been
able
to
attend
school
when
he
was
a
boy
he
could
have
told
an
adjective
from
any
other
part
of
speech
and
his
wonder
at
her
amount
of
learning
was
all
the
greater
on
that
account
he
patted
her
hand
affectionately
that
right
right
he
exclaimed
the
family
dependin
on
you
puss
to
do
us
all
credit
then
he
began
repeating
what
she
had
heard
a
hundred
times
before
he
never
failed
to
tell
her
the
same
story
as
they
jogged
homeward
every
friday
night
and
back
again
the
following
monday
morning
she
had
heard
it
so
often
that
it
sounded
in
her
ears
like
the
familiar
refrain
of
an
old
song
to
which
she
need
pay
no
heed
she
only
waited
patiently
until
he
had
finished
the
older
children
did
have
no
chance
when
they
was
young
like
you
we
were
too
far
away
from
the
public
schools
to
send
except
just
a
spell
spring
and
fall
and
we
could
afford
the
pay
schools
but
after
we
moved
up
here
and
marthy
got
married
and
tom
and
hilliard
was
big
enough
to
do
for
and
getting
good
wages
times
was
easier
ma
says
to
me
give
the
baby
a
fair
start
in
the
world
anyhow
and
i
says
have
the
best
diplomy
that
lloydsboro
seminary
can
give
if
i
have
to
carry
her
there
and
home
again
on
my
back
every
day
till
she
gets
it
there
was
much
more
in
the
same
strain
to
which
magnolia
listened
waiting
for
her
turn
to
speak
as
one
would
wait
for
an
alarm
clock
to
run
down
when
it
was
striking
the
moment
he
paused
she
began
eagerly
i
got
something
right
now
that
mammy
will
be
proud
to
see
diving
under
the
quilt
for
the
she
opened
it
and
took
out
a
book
which
lay
on
top
of
her
clothes
now
put
on
your
spectacles
daddy
she
ordered
gaily
or
maybe
you
wo
be
able
to
tell
who
it
is
she
slipped
a
photograph
from
the
book
and
held
it
up
before
him
holding
the
reins
between
his
knees
he
pulled
off
one
glove
felt
in
various
pockets
and
finally
fished
up
a
pair
of
spectacles
which
he
slowly
adjusted
miss
katherine
marks
took
it
she
explained
and
she
painted
it
afterward
so
you
can
tell
exactly
how
i
looked
at
the
if
it
ai
my
little
magnolia
blossom
exclaimed
the
old
man
proudly
holding
the
beautifully
tinted
photograph
off
at
arm
length
for
a
better
view
wherever
did
you
get
all
those
fine
why
puss
you
prettier
than
a
posy
sort
of
fanciful
and
trimmed
up
but
that
your
little
face
natural
as
life
i
should
say
your
mammy
will
be
proud
it
took
all
the
time
while
they
were
driving
the
next
six
miles
for
magnolia
to
tell
of
that
memorable
afternoon
and
night
how
lloyd
sherman
had
taken
her
over
to
clovercroft
and
all
the
marks
family
had
helped
to
make
her
costume
how
beautiful
it
was
and
how
the
girls
had
praised
it
and
even
published
a
poem
about
her
in
the
and
next
day
miss
katherine
had
taken
her
picture
and
the
day
after
that
had
sent
for
her
to
come
over
to
her
studio
and
had
given
her
a
copy
of
it
to
take
home
seems
to
me
as
if
we
ought
to
do
something
nice
for
those
people
who
have
been
so
kind
to
you
said
her
father
musingly
when
she
had
told
him
the
whole
story
you
say
if
it
had
been
for
miss
katherine
have
had
to
miss
the
party
if
you
have
missed
that
you
would
have
had
that
poetry
about
you
in
the
paper
i
proud
of
that
puss
seems
as
if
my
little
girl
is
mighty
popular
a
sort
of
celebrity
to
get
into
the
paper
i
like
to
show
that
young
lady
that
i
appreciate
what
she
done
to
make
you
happy
i
wonder
how
she
like
a
crock
of
your
mammy
apple
butter
there
ai
no
better
apple
butter
in
all
oldham
county
and
i
should
think
she
be
glad
to
get
it
i
speak
about
it
when
we
get
home
and
if
your
mammy
willing
i
carry
a
crock
of
it
to
the
young
lady
when
i
take
you
back
to
school
monday
morning
magnolia
was
not
sure
of
the
propriety
of
such
a
gift
and
he
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
slow
mind
all
the
rest
of
the
way
home
they
jogged
along
in
silence
for
she
also
was
busy
with
her
thoughts
she
was
thinking
of
another
picture
in
the
library
book
which
she
had
not
showed
her
father
it
was
an
unmounted
photograph
of
lloyd
sherman
which
miss
katherine
had
taken
the
year
before
she
had
photographed
all
the
children
who
took
part
in
the
play
of
the
rescue
of
the
princess
winsome
and
they
were
arranged
on
a
panel
on
her
studio
wall
there
were
several
of
lloyd
one
at
the
one
with
her
arms
around
hero
neck
and
one
with
the
knight
kneeling
to
take
her
hand
from
the
old
king
but
the
most
beautiful
one
of
all
was
the
one
of
the
dove
song
that
picture
hung
by
itself
it
was
just
a
little
medallion
showing
the
head
of
the
princess
with
the
white
dove
nestled
against
her
shoulder
the
fair
hair
with
its
coronet
of
pearls
made
a
halo
around
the
sweet
little
face
and
magnolia
stood
gazing
at
it
as
if
it
had
been
the
picture
of
an
angel
she
had
no
eyes
for
anything
else
in
the
studio
and
miss
flora
seeing
her
gaze
of
rapt
admiration
looked
across
at
her
sister
and
smiled
significantly
have
you
a
copy
of
that
you
could
give
her
katherine
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
never
saw
a
child
face
express
such
wistful
longing
it
makes
me
think
of
some
of
the
little
waifs
i
have
seen
at
christmas
time
gazing
hungrily
into
the
shop
windows
at
the
toys
and
they
know
can
never
be
for
them
miss
katherine
opened
a
table
drawer
and
after
searching
a
few
minutes
among
the
unmounted
photographs
it
contained
took
out
one
regarding
it
critically
this
was
a
trifle
too
light
to
suit
me
she
said
but
too
good
to
destroy
she
crossed
the
room
and
held
it
out
to
magnolia
who
still
stood
gazing
at
its
duplicate
on
the
wall
such
a
look
of
rapture
came
into
the
child
face
when
it
was
finally
made
clear
to
her
that
she
was
to
have
the
picture
to
keep
that
no
one
noticed
the
omission
of
spoken
thanks
she
was
too
embarrassed
to
say
anything
but
she
took
it
as
if
it
were
something
sacred
i
suppose
because
lloyd
happens
to
be
the
goddess
just
now
to
whom
she
burns
incense
said
miss
katherine
when
she
had
gone
these
little
schoolgirl
affairs
are
very
amusing
sometimes
they
so
intense
while
they
last
maggie
could
not
have
told
why
she
did
not
show
the
picture
of
the
princess
to
her
father
in
an
undefined
sort
of
way
she
felt
that
he
would
look
at
it
as
he
would
look
at
the
picture
of
any
little
girl
and
that
he
would
not
understand
that
she
was
so
much
finer
and
better
and
more
beautiful
and
different
in
every
way
from
all
the
other
girls
in
the
world
but
corono
would
understand
for
two
days
magnolia
had
looked
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
showing
it
to
her
ca
you
get
old
dixie
out
of
a
walk
daddy
she
exclaimed
at
last
i
mighty
anxious
to
get
home
before
sundown
i
want
to
stop
at
roney
with
this
library
book
and
show
her
the
picture
too
aroused
from
his
reverie
the
old
farmer
clucked
to
his
horse
and
they
went
bumping
down
the
stony
pike
at
a
gait
which
satisfied
even
impatient
desire
for
speed
i
reckon
roney
will
be
mighty
glad
to
see
you
he
remarked
as
he
stopped
the
horse
in
front
of
an
old
cabin
a
short
distance
from
his
own
home
she
been
worse
this
week
you
have
half
an
hour
yet
before
sundown
he
added
as
he
turned
the
wheel
for
her
to
climb
out
of
the
carryall
i
stay
till
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
for
i
have
so
much
to
tell
her
this
week
with
the
library
book
tucked
away
under
the
old
gray
shawl
she
ran
down
the
straggling
path
to
the
little
whitewashed
cabin
roney
would
understand
roney
had
always
understood
things
from
the
time
they
had
first
been
neighbours
on
a
lonely
farm
near
loretta
that
was
when
magnolia
was
a
baby
and
corono
six
years
older
without
a
playmate
and
without
a
toy
had
daily
borrowed
her
and
played
with
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
great
doll
it
was
corono
who
had
discovered
her
first
tooth
and
who
had
coaxed
her
to
take
her
first
step
and
had
taught
her
nearly
everything
she
knew
from
threading
a
needle
and
tying
a
knot
to
spelling
out
the
words
on
the
tombstones
in
the
graveyard
corono
could
often
tell
what
she
was
thinking
about
even
before
she
said
a
word
she
was
the
only
one
at
home
to
whom
magnolia
ever
mentioned
the
princess
several
years
before
the
two
families
had
moved
away
together
from
the
old
place
in
that
time
corono
mother
had
died
and
her
father
had
become
so
crippled
with
rheumatism
that
he
could
no
longer
manage
to
do
the
heavy
work
on
the
farm
he
had
rented
they
were
glad
to
accept
their
old
neighbour
offer
of
an
empty
cabin
on
his
place
after
that
when
corono
was
not
at
the
farmhouse
helping
budine
with
her
cleaning
or
sewing
or
magnolia
was
at
the
cabin
following
at
the
little
housekeeper
very
heels
as
she
went
about
her
daily
tasks
but
now
for
several
months
corono
had
been
barely
able
to
drag
from
one
room
to
another
whether
it
was
a
fall
she
had
had
in
the
early
summer
which
injured
her
back
or
whether
it
was
some
disease
of
the
spine
past
his
skill
to
discover
the
doctor
from
the
crossroads
could
not
decide
her
father
had
to
be
housekeeper
now
and
they
would
have
had
meagre
fare
oftentimes
had
not
a
generous
share
of
every
pie
and
pudding
baked
in
the
budine
kitchen
found
its
way
to
their
table
the
weeks
would
have
been
almost
unbearably
monotonous
to
corono
after
magnolia
started
to
school
had
she
not
looked
forward
to
the
fridays
when
her
return
meant
the
bringing
of
a
new
library
book
and
another
delightfully
interesting
chapter
of
her
life
at
the
seminary
these
glimpses
into
a
world
so
different
from
her
own
gave
her
something
to
think
about
all
week
as
she
dragged
wearily
about
trying
to
help
her
father
in
his
awkward
struggles
with
the
cooking
and
cleaning
she
thought
about
them
at
night
too
when
the
pain
in
her
back
kept
her
awake
betty
and
lloyd
and
allison
kitty
and
elise
and
katie
mallard
were
as
real
to
her
as
they
were
to
maggie
they
would
have
stared
in
astonishment
could
they
have
known
that
every
week
a
girl
whom
they
had
never
seen
and
of
whom
they
had
barely
heard
was
waiting
to
ask
a
dozen
eager
questions
about
them
maggie
ran
in
without
knocking
bringing
such
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
fresh
interest
with
her
that
corono
face
brightened
instantly
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
with
a
shawl
thrown
over
her
i
been
listening
for
you
for
more
than
an
hour
said
corono
propping
herself
up
on
her
elbow
i
thought
the
time
never
would
pass
i
counted
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
then
i
tried
to
see
how
much
of
betty
play
i
could
repeat
i
read
it
so
many
times
this
week
that
i
know
it
nearly
all
by
heart
she
picked
up
the
book
which
lay
beside
her
on
the
bed
it
was
the
library
copy
of
the
rescue
of
the
princess
winsome
which
maggie
had
brought
to
her
the
previous
friday
it
had
been
in
such
constant
demand
since
the
opening
of
school
that
she
had
been
unable
to
obtain
it
earlier
maggie
about
to
plunge
into
an
account
of
her
experiences
checked
herself
as
corono
winced
with
pain
and
her
face
grew
suddenly
white
what
the
matter
she
asked
sympathetically
do
you
feel
very
bad
to
her
astonishment
corono
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
to
hide
the
tears
that
were
trickling
down
her
cheeks
and
began
to
sob
i
run
get
mammy
said
the
frightened
child
who
had
never
seen
corono
give
way
to
her
feelings
in
such
fashion
before
no
do
she
sobbed
i
be
all
right
in
a
minute
i
just
nervous
from
the
pain
i
have
slept
much
lately
maggie
sat
motionless
afraid
to
make
any
attempt
at
consolation
even
so
much
as
patting
her
cheek
with
her
plump
little
hand
roney
was
the
one
who
had
always
comforted
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
now
that
their
positions
were
suddenly
reversed
she
was
relieved
when
roney
presently
wiped
her
eyes
and
said
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
there
you
never
saw
me
make
a
baby
of
myself
before
did
you
but
i
could
help
it
sometimes
when
it
gets
this
way
i
wish
i
could
die
but
i
just
to
keep
on
living
for
daddy
sake
i
do
suppose
any
one
ever
told
you
and
you
could
understand
unless
you
knew
it
this
way
my
mother
family
never
wanted
her
to
marry
daddy
and
they
disowned
her
when
she
did
because
he
was
educated
and
rich
and
all
that
as
they
were
they
never
spoke
to
her
afterward
but
when
my
grandfather
came
to
die
i
reckon
he
was
sorry
for
the
way
he
done
for
he
wanted
to
send
for
her
it
was
too
late
though
she
had
died
that
spring
then
he
tried
to
make
it
up
in
a
way
by
being
good
to
me
and
he
left
me
an
annuity
i
ca
explain
to
you
just
what
that
is
but
every
year
as
long
as
i
live
his
lawyer
is
to
pay
me
some
money
it
is
much
but
it
is
all
that
daddy
and
i
have
had
to
live
on
since
he
has
been
able
to
work
when
i
die
the
money
will
stop
coming
so
i
feel
that
i
keep
on
living
even
when
every
breath
is
agony
as
it
is
sometimes
i
do
think
i
can
stand
it
much
longer
there
are
days
when
i
just
have
to
grit
my
teeth
and
say
i
give
up
i
will
hang
on
for
poor
daddy
sake
sometimes
i
believe
that
is
all
that
keeps
me
alive
she
stopped
abruptly
seeing
the
tears
of
distress
in
maggie
eyes
and
made
an
attempt
to
laugh
there
she
exclaimed
now
that
i
poured
out
all
my
troubles
and
eased
my
mind
i
feel
better
tell
me
about
the
girls
what
have
they
been
doing
this
week
much
relieved
maggie
produced
the
photograph
of
herself
and
began
an
enthusiastic
account
of
her
experiences
she
began
with
the
visit
to
clovercroft
and
as
she
described
the
handsomely
furnished
with
its
luxurious
rugs
and
grand
piano
and
the
priceless
pictures
that
had
been
brought
from
over
the
sea
its
lace
curtains
and
white
tiled
hearth
and
andirons
that
shone
like
gold
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
little
cabin
had
never
looked
so
bare
its
chinked
walls
and
puncheon
floor
stood
out
in
pitiful
contrast
the
only
picture
in
the
room
was
an
unframed
chromo
tacked
above
the
mantel
as
she
described
the
masquerade
frolic
she
contrasted
roney
lonely
life
with
her
own
and
the
other
girls
at
the
seminary
a
realization
of
its
meagreness
and
emptiness
stole
over
her
till
she
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
back
a
great
longing
sprang
up
in
her
warm
little
heart
to
do
something
that
would
compensate
as
far
as
possible
for
all
that
she
had
missed
acting
on
that
impulse
as
she
reached
the
climax
of
her
story
and
drew
out
the
cherished
photograph
of
the
princess
she
thrust
it
into
roney
hand
saying
hurriedly
here
you
can
have
it
roney
i
rather
you
would
have
it
than
me
corono
held
the
picture
eagerly
studying
every
detail
of
the
beautiful
little
medallion
the
fair
hair
with
its
coronet
of
pearls
the
white
dove
nestled
against
her
shoulder
as
she
had
held
it
when
she
sang
flutter
and
fly
flutter
and
fly
bear
him
my
heart
of
gold
all
seemed
doubly
attractive
now
with
the
play
fresh
in
her
mind
besides
it
was
the
most
beautiful
picture
she
had
ever
seen
in
all
the
sixteen
years
of
her
lonely
unsatisfied
life
the
intuition
that
always
helped
her
to
understand
her
little
friend
made
her
understand
now
in
a
way
that
the
gift
meant
a
sacrifice
and
she
exclaimed
impulsively
oh
maggie
i
do
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
take
it
from
you
you
keep
it
and
just
lend
it
to
me
once
in
awhile
no
i
want
you
to
have
it
said
maggie
drawing
the
old
shawl
up
around
her
goodness
me
it
getting
dark
i
have
to
run
and
before
corono
could
make
another
protest
she
rushed
away
as
she
ran
along
the
path
that
crossed
the
pasture
between
the
cabin
and
the
farmhouse
there
was
a
tremulous
smile
on
her
face
but
the
faint
twilight
also
showed
tears
in
her
eyes
the
smile
was
for
the
joy
she
knew
she
had
given
roney
but
the
tears
were
for
herself
nobody
knew
how
much
of
a
sacrifice
she
had
made
in
giving
up
the
picture
of
the
princess
even
roney
had
not
guessed
how
great
it
was
but
she
had
no
regret
next
morning
when
she
came
back
to
the
cabin
roney
greeted
her
eagerly
look
she
cried
pointing
to
the
old
wooden
clock
which
stood
on
the
mantel
i
did
have
a
frame
to
put
the
picture
in
and
i
was
afraid
it
would
get
spoiled
without
glass
over
it
while
i
was
looking
around
the
room
wondering
what
to
do
i
happened
to
notice
that
it
was
the
same
size
as
the
pendulum
daddy
lifted
it
down
for
me
and
i
fastened
the
picture
on
that
so
there
it
is
all
safe
and
sound
behind
the
glass
door
and
i
can
see
it
from
any
part
of
the
room
and
oh
maggie
you
do
know
how
it
helped
me
last
night
it
made
the
play
seem
so
real
to
me
as
i
lay
here
watching
the
pendulum
it
stopped
saying
tock
tick
tock
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
princess
was
looking
straight
at
me
saying
instead
love
will
find
a
way
then
i
knew
that
she
meant
me
that
love
would
help
me
bear
the
pain
for
daddy
sake
that
my
living
along
as
bravely
as
i
could
was
like
spinning
the
golden
thread
and
that
i
must
think
about
the
great
skein
that
the
weeks
and
months
were
piling
up
ahead
for
me
to
do
i
must
just
spin
a
minute
at
a
time
i
can
stand
the
pain
when
i
count
it
with
the
pendulum
even
when
the
fire
died
down
and
i
could
see
her
any
longer
i
could
hear
her
saying
it
over
and
over
love
will
find
a
way
and
i
lay
there
in
the
dark
and
pretended
that
i
was
a
princess
too
spinning
love
golden
thread
and
that
my
dove
was
a
little
white
prayer
that
i
could
send
fluttering
up
to
god
asking
him
to
help
me
find
the
way
to
be
brave
and
patient
and
to
hang
on
to
life
as
long
as
i
possibly
can
for
daddy
sake
little
did
the
shadow
club
dream
that
day
how
far
their
were
reaching
but
betty
song
brought
comfort
and
courage
for
many
an
hour
into
roney
lonely
life
and
the
greatest
solace
in
her
keenest
suffering
was
the
smiling
face
of
the
princess
swaying
back
and
forth
upon
the
pendulum
chapter
ix
one
rainy
afternoon
that
same
saturday
afternoon
following
the
frolic
while
maggie
rehearsed
the
whole
affair
once
more
in
the
cabin
the
shadow
club
discussed
it
at
the
seminary
they
had
met
early
for
lloyd
and
betty
had
asked
permission
to
make
candy
in
their
room
and
in
order
to
finish
the
amount
of
work
they
had
planned
to
do
at
each
meeting
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
begin
immediately
after
dinner
it
was
a
dull
november
day
cloudy
and
damp
and
while
they
were
settling
themselves
to
work
the
rain
began
to
patter
against
the
how
cosy
and
it
makes
you
feel
exclaimed
katie
looking
around
on
the
bright
comfortable
room
we
are
shut
in
answered
lloyd
the
clark
girls
and
magnolia
have
gone
home
to
stay
ovah
sunday
and
we
have
this
whole
wing
to
ourselves
nobody
can
heah
us
no
mattah
how
loud
we
talk
let
put
up
the
sign
admittance
busy
on
the
corridor
door
leading
into
our
hall
suggested
ida
on
a
rainy
afternoon
like
this
when
the
girls
ca
get
they
more
apt
to
go
visiting
and
we
do
want
to
be
interrupted
that
so
agreed
lloyd
hastily
scribbling
the
notice
on
an
envelope
she
ran
out
and
fastened
it
on
the
door
with
a
pin
now
we
safe
she
announced
on
her
return
and
settled
herself
comfortably
among
the
cushions
of
the
for
half
an
hour
their
needles
and
brushes
were
plied
rapidly
as
they
chattered
and
laughed
over
the
various
remarks
they
had
heard
about
the
mysterious
guests
who
they
were
still
remained
an
unsolved
riddle
in
the
school
presently
ida
dropped
her
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
yawning
oh
i
in
no
mood
for
work
of
this
kind
my
silks
snarl
my
needle
keeps
coming
unthreaded
and
i
stick
myself
nearly
every
time
i
take
a
stitch
i
making
such
a
mess
of
it
i
stop
only
i
do
want
to
shirk
my
part
when
you
are
all
working
so
faithfully
when
my
embroidery
acts
this
way
it
makes
me
so
nervous
i
could
scream
why
do
you
do
some
more
instead
suggested
katie
i
out
of
leather
the
last
lot
i
sent
for
has
come
you
might
read
to
us
while
we
work
suggested
betty
there
a
new
on
the
table
yes
do
insisted
allison
mother
said
this
morning
that
she
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
plan
for
us
to
take
up
some
good
book
and
read
it
in
turn
while
we
work
as
all
the
girls
agreed
ida
picked
up
the
magazine
and
began
turning
the
leaves
what
will
you
have
she
asked
this
scientific
article
does
look
very
entertaining
and
this
football
story
would
interest
anybody
but
boys
we
ca
plunge
into
the
middle
of
this
serial
without
having
read
the
first
chapters
and
judging
from
the
illustrations
and
the
name
of
this
girl
story
it
is
anything
but
wildly
exciting
she
glanced
hastily
over
the
remaining
pages
and
then
laid
the
magazine
aside
i
wonder
she
said
hesitatingly
if
any
of
you
have
ever
read
a
book
i
have
in
my
room
called
fortunes
of
daisy
dale
it
the
sweetest
thing
i
nearly
cried
my
eyes
out
over
part
of
it
of
course
it
a
novel
and
some
people
object
to
them
unless
they
by
some
great
writer
like
thackeray
or
scott
i
know
my
aunt
does
but
i
see
how
this
could
hurt
anybody
it
about
a
dear
little
english
girl
whose
guardian
kept
her
almost
like
a
prisoner
so
that
he
could
use
her
money
she
had
such
a
hard
time
that
she
ran
away
and
got
a
place
as
a
governess
when
she
was
only
sixteen
she
had
all
sorts
of
trouble
and
misunderstandings
but
it
ends
happily
all
the
way
through
she
has
such
a
beautiful
influence
on
young
lord
rokeby
and
guy
wolvering
the
squire
son
who
is
so
wild
that
his
father
threatens
to
disinherit
him
it
is
his
love
for
her
that
finally
reforms
him
her
influence
over
him
is
a
living
illustration
of
the
motto
of
our
club
then
let
read
it
proposed
allison
eagerly
oh
yes
go
get
it
ida
called
lloyd
and
kitty
in
the
same
breath
that
is
if
you
do
mind
reading
it
twice
yourself
added
betty
no
indeed
answered
ida
rising
i
could
read
it
a
dozen
times
and
never
tire
of
it
in
a
moment
she
was
back
from
her
room
carrying
the
book
in
one
hand
and
dragging
a
behind
her
with
the
other
she
drew
it
up
to
one
of
the
windows
and
pushing
the
curtains
farther
aside
sat
down
and
began
to
read
to
the
pattering
accompaniment
of
the
on
the
pane
she
was
a
good
reader
the
best
in
the
seminary
and
her
well
modulated
voice
would
have
lent
a
charm
to
any
story
but
the
expression
she
threw
into
this
made
it
seem
as
if
she
were
recounting
her
own
personal
troubles
she
had
not
read
half
a
chapter
before
lloyd
understood
why
it
seemed
so
ida
was
putting
herself
in
daisy
dale
place
instead
of
the
unjust
guardian
there
was
the
unreasonable
aunt
instead
of
the
squire
son
edwardo
and
the
stolen
meetings
and
the
smuggled
letters
and
the
pearl
daisy
wore
in
secret
recalled
the
confidences
of
the
night
in
the
orchard
and
many
that
had
been
whispered
to
her
since
the
shadow
club
forgot
where
they
were
presently
they
ceased
to
notice
that
the
cold
rain
drove
faster
and
faster
against
the
windows
they
were
treading
a
winding
path
across
a
sunny
english
meadow
with
daisy
and
her
lover
it
was
where
they
wandered
the
hawthorn
hedges
were
budding
white
and
even
the
crevices
of
the
old
stone
wall
flaunted
its
bloom
wherever
a
cluster
of
london
pride
could
find
a
foothold
in
a
little
while
katie
slipped
into
her
lap
unheeded
with
chin
in
hands
and
elbows
on
her
knees
she
leaned
forward
listening
with
rapt
attention
betty
laid
down
her
and
kitty
and
allison
stopped
painting
it
was
a
wild
stormy
night
now
and
they
were
suffering
with
daisy
as
with
clasped
hands
and
streaming
eyes
she
turned
her
back
on
her
old
home
driven
out
to
seek
her
own
living
by
her
guardian
unbearable
tyranny
lloyd
cheeks
burned
redder
and
redder
as
the
story
went
on
and
daisy
dale
established
as
governess
at
cameron
hall
again
met
guy
wolvering
and
listened
to
his
vows
of
deathless
devotion
she
wondered
how
ida
could
read
on
so
calmly
when
some
of
those
scenes
had
been
her
own
experience
she
wondered
what
the
girls
would
say
if
they
knew
all
that
she
knew
then
she
wondered
how
it
would
feel
to
be
the
heroine
in
such
scenes
and
be
the
idol
of
some
one
whole
existence
as
daisy
dale
was
of
guy
wolvering
as
ida
was
of
edwardo
oh
do
stop
begged
five
eager
voices
when
ida
finally
laid
down
the
book
i
must
it
nearly
dark
and
my
throat
is
tired
do
you
realize
i
have
been
reading
all
afternoon
oh
it
did
seem
more
than
five
minutes
exclaimed
katie
i
never
was
so
interested
in
anything
in
my
life
i
am
wild
to
hear
the
end
girls
cried
allison
tragically
starting
up
from
her
chair
i
wish
you
look
at
that
clock
we
have
made
the
candy
and
we
scarcely
worked
at
all
this
whole
afternoon
and
now
it
time
to
go
home
but
how
can
we
queried
kitty
it
simply
pouring
look
at
those
windows
the
rain
is
coming
in
torrents
we
have
to
stay
all
night
laughed
katie
would
it
be
fun
if
we
could
you
can
cried
lloyd
seizing
the
suggestion
eagerly
i
sure
that
the
matron
would
be
willing
there
plenty
of
extra
rooms
on
satahday
night
there
two
right
heah
in
this
wing
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
telephone
home
and
ask
yoah
mothahs
i
suah
they
let
you
because
it
such
dreadful
weathah
come
on
let
go
and
ask
now
then
we
can
make
the
candy
befoah
suppah
and
finish
the
book
befoah
bedtime
with
the
pouring
rain
as
an
excuse
it
was
easy
to
obtain
the
permission
for
them
to
stay
and
she
herself
telephoned
to
walton
and
mallard
explaining
the
situation
and
assuring
them
that
the
girls
would
be
well
taken
care
of
both
mothers
gave
consent
so
thankfully
that
the
matron
turned
away
from
the
telephone
feeling
that
her
hospitable
insistence
had
made
these
ladies
her
friends
for
life
and
she
bustled
away
well
pleased
with
herself
to
put
fresh
sheets
on
the
beds
in
the
empty
rooms
in
the
west
wing
the
clark
sisters
room
next
to
lloyd
and
betty
had
a
closet
built
opposite
theirs
into
the
same
in
the
deep
space
beside
the
chimney
when
both
doors
were
closed
no
sound
penetrated
from
one
room
to
the
other
but
if
either
were
left
ajar
any
one
happening
to
step
into
either
closet
could
hear
quite
distinctly
what
was
said
on
the
other
side
the
matron
opening
the
closet
door
on
her
side
of
the
wall
to
fold
away
some
blankets
that
she
had
just
taken
from
the
beds
heard
lloyd
on
the
other
side
hunting
for
the
bottle
of
alcohol
for
the
then
katie
voice
came
piping
through
high
and
shrill
was
it
sweet
of
mrs
bond
to
telephone
herself
and
insist
on
our
being
allowed
to
stay
if
i
had
been
at
the
telephone
mamma
would
have
said
that
she
would
send
the
carriage
and
i
need
get
wet
and
could
come
home
just
as
well
as
not
but
she
was
willing
to
accept
an
invitation
from
headquarters
i
going
to
save
mrs
bond
some
of
my
fudge
she
just
the
dearest
thing
that
ever
was
illustration
she
could
hear
every
word
of
the
conversation
i
shall
save
her
some
too
said
kitty
i
like
to
give
her
a
good
big
squeeze
for
being
so
kind
to
us
mrs
bond
stepped
out
into
the
room
again
with
a
pleased
smile
on
her
motherly
face
as
she
went
she
began
revolving
a
plan
in
her
mind
for
the
evening
entertainment
of
these
appreciative
little
guests
which
she
thought
would
give
them
still
greater
pleasure
scarcely
had
she
gone
when
another
listener
took
her
place
this
time
the
eavesdropping
was
intentional
mittie
dupong
crossing
over
to
the
west
wing
to
borrow
a
magazine
from
betty
saw
the
sign
on
the
corridor
door
knowing
what
such
signs
usually
mean
at
five
on
a
saturday
afternoon
she
softly
turned
the
knob
and
stepped
into
the
narrow
hall
a
delicious
smell
of
boiling
candy
came
floating
down
toward
her
from
lloyd
room
and
a
peal
of
laughter
in
which
she
distinguished
first
allison
voice
then
and
katie
she
felt
a
trifle
piqued
at
being
left
out
of
the
i
wonder
who
else
is
in
there
she
thought
slipping
on
toward
the
keyhole
just
as
she
was
about
to
stoop
and
peep
in
a
sudden
noise
inside
as
of
some
one
coming
toward
her
made
her
draw
back
the
door
into
the
clark
girls
room
stood
open
she
darted
in
and
waited
breathlessly
lloyd
was
coming
out
into
the
hall
saying
never
mind
about
the
i
get
cassie
mittie
had
barely
time
to
spring
into
the
closet
when
lloyd
entered
took
the
lamp
from
the
table
and
carried
it
back
to
her
own
room
crouched
down
in
her
dark
mittie
discovered
that
the
closet
was
a
far
better
situation
for
eavesdropping
than
the
keyhole
she
could
hear
every
word
of
the
conversation
without
the
risk
of
being
detected
evidently
the
girls
were
discussing
some
story
that
they
had
been
reading
and
a
very
sentimental
one
at
that
a
wicked
little
gleam
of
triumph
came
into
mittie
eyes
as
she
listened
for
here
were
lloyd
and
allison
and
kitty
and
katie
mallard
and
betty
actually
teasing
each
other
about
the
boys
they
liked
best
and
it
had
been
a
week
since
lloyd
had
said
with
a
scornful
little
toss
of
her
head
oh
mittie
you
make
me
always
talking
about
the
boys
and
the
four
of
them
had
walked
off
with
their
arms
around
each
other
as
if
quite
disgusted
oh
wo
i
get
even
with
them
now
for
turning
up
their
noses
at
me
exclaimed
mittie
to
herself
and
she
pressed
her
ear
closer
to
the
thin
partition
wall
that
divided
the
two
closets
katie
voice
came
first
if
i
been
daisy
dale
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
lord
rokeby
instead
of
the
squire
son
because
he
was
tall
and
fair
and
like
charlie
downs
put
in
kitty
mischievously
oh
girls
look
at
her
blush
i
not
blushing
protested
katie
wildly
but
you
ca
deny
that
he
the
one
insisted
kitty
even
when
we
were
little
and
used
to
play
come
to
see
you
always
played
that
you
were
downs
you
know
you
did
i
do
care
pouted
katie
i
do
do
it
now
and
anyhow
i
keep
an
old
dead
rose
and
a
valentine
and
a
brass
button
all
tied
up
in
a
fancy
box
with
blue
ribbon
the
way
you
do
because
guy
ferris
gave
them
to
you
who
blushing
katie
mallard
that
something
you
promised
you
never
tell
as
long
as
you
live
cried
kitty
i
did
think
you
be
so
mean
as
to
go
back
on
your
promise
she
turned
away
with
such
an
offended
air
that
katie
saw
that
her
teasing
had
gone
farther
than
she
intended
she
hastened
to
make
amends
for
she
could
be
happy
while
there
was
the
slightest
misunderstanding
between
her
and
her
best
friend
i
did
think
you
care
kitty
truly
i
did
i
would
have
teased
you
before
the
other
girls
but
just
here
in
our
own
little
club
it
ought
to
make
any
difference
why
i
do
mind
one
bit
telling
you
girls
that
i
like
charlie
downs
better
than
any
boy
i
know
and
that
i
felt
glad
when
my
apple
parings
made
his
initials
every
time
i
threw
them
over
my
shoulder
on
i
do
think
it
anything
to
confess
that
much
or
to
care
for
things
a
boy
gives
you
as
you
do
for
the
valentine
and
the
rose
that
a
very
different
matter
from
talking
about
the
boys
as
mittie
dupong
does
about
carter
brown
well
i
should
think
so
exclaimed
lloyd
in
a
tone
that
made
mittie
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
set
her
teeth
together
angrily
but
mittie
is
like
the
girls
we
always
gone
with
she
so
she
plays
i
nevah
had
any
use
for
her
since
cartah
brown
birthday
pahty
when
they
played
pillow
and
every
boy
in
the
room
kissed
her
and
lollie
briggs
and
all
that
set
of
girls
that
she
goes
with
i
could
undahstand
it
some
of
them
seemed
so
nice
flynn
willis
you
know
and
caddie
bailey
i
would
have
thought
it
of
them
i
think
they
are
all
nice
girls
said
betty
even
mittie
it
just
because
they
have
been
brought
up
that
way
they
all
come
from
little
towns
where
such
games
are
the
custom
and
they
really
do
know
any
better
do
be
so
fierce
about
it
lloyd
one
of
the
girls
at
our
table
ate
with
her
knife
when
she
first
came
and
took
her
soup
out
of
the
end
of
her
spoon
and
picked
her
pie
up
in
her
fingers
but
she
as
ladylike
in
her
manners
as
anybody
now
she
simply
had
been
taught
how
to
eat
those
girls
will
change
too
probably
in
time
but
this
is
different
persisted
lloyd
i
know
whom
you
mean
it
was
that
little
prosser
girl
but
for
all
her
bad
table
mannahs
she
was
a
lady
at
heart
did
take
part
in
those
games
and
she
allow
a
boy
to
take
such
a
liberty
with
her
as
to
kiss
her
any
moah
than
one
of
us
girls
would
that
had
been
brought
up
heah
in
the
valley
i
always
be
glad
we
did
ask
mittie
or
any
of
that
set
to
join
our
club
they
may
be
all
right
but
if
they
do
want
to
be
considahed
common
they
ought
to
do
things
that
make
them
seem
so
and
that
are
considahed
so
by
the
best
society
the
blue
blood
of
an
old
patrician
family
proud
of
its
traditions
and
proud
of
its
generations
of
gentle
breeding
was
coursing
hotly
through
the
little
colonel
veins
as
she
spoke
mittie
could
imagine
how
she
looked
as
she
stood
there
passing
judgment
her
head
haughtily
lifted
a
flush
on
the
little
face
the
mortified
eavesdropper
could
not
feel
that
she
had
really
done
anything
wrong
at
the
party
for
as
betty
had
said
such
games
were
always
played
in
the
country
place
where
she
came
from
even
in
the
presence
of
grown
people
and
the
sport
was
often
rough
and
boisterous
as
it
is
among
the
peasant
class
of
the
older
countries
but
measuring
herself
by
lloyd
exacting
standard
she
somehow
felt
that
she
had
been
found
sadly
wanting
and
she
angrily
resented
the
verdict
of
this
little
patrician
who
dainty
and
refined
to
the
very
made
her
seem
less
of
a
lady
less
worthy
of
respect
than
herself
the
next
instant
lloyd
scornful
tone
changed
to
one
of
cheerful
sweetness
as
she
called
bring
the
buttered
plates
betty
please
the
fudge
is
ready
to
pour
out
hiding
there
in
the
dark
closet
mittie
heard
many
things
during
the
next
which
she
stored
away
in
her
memory
for
future
repetition
the
secret
of
the
shadow
club
was
one
for
they
discussed
it
freely
regretting
that
they
had
accomplished
so
little
that
afternoon
and
discussing
the
place
of
the
next
meeting
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
red
casting
a
soft
rosy
glow
over
the
room
it
seemed
a
time
for
confidences
the
rain
came
harder
and
harder
in
stormy
gusts
against
the
windows
but
the
curtains
that
shut
out
the
night
seemed
to
shut
them
in
with
the
warmth
and
cheer
of
the
cosy
room
as
they
drew
their
chairs
around
the
table
rocking
comfortably
back
and
forth
with
the
candy
passing
from
hand
to
hand
they
felt
more
closely
drawn
together
themselves
than
they
ever
had
before
and
they
talked
of
things
they
had
never
mentioned
to
each
other
before
the
fortunes
of
daisy
dale
had
turned
their
thoughts
toward
the
future
and
standing
before
its
closed
gate
as
if
it
were
the
portal
to
some
unexplored
paradise
they
questioned
each
other
with
eager
wondering
as
to
what
might
lie
in
store
for
them
on
the
other
side
well
exclaimed
katie
at
length
when
i
grow
up
i
hope
the
man
who
proposes
to
me
will
do
it
just
as
guy
did
i
think
it
so
pretty
that
scene
in
the
cherry
lane
she
quoted
softly
cherry
lane
is
all
in
bridal
white
my
marguerite
and
when
it
blooms
again
i
come
to
claim
my
bride
my
pearl
i
wonder
if
they
all
talk
that
way
mused
kitty
of
course
not
said
betty
with
a
laugh
it
would
fit
in
most
cases
imagine
old
andrews
calling
his
little
black
skinny
wife
his
jane
maria
his
pearl
i
suppose
most
people
do
it
in
as
commonplace
a
way
as
laurie
proposed
to
amy
in
women
i
going
to
ask
papa
what
said
declared
katie
then
the
rang
and
mittie
heard
no
more
as
soon
as
it
was
safe
to
venture
from
her
she
followed
them
down
to
the
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
reading
of
the
book
the
members
of
the
shadow
club
could
hardly
conceal
their
disappointment
when
mrs
bond
invited
them
into
her
parlour
after
supper
to
try
some
new
games
which
she
thought
would
interest
them
under
the
circumstances
they
felt
it
would
be
impolite
to
refuse
they
whispered
to
each
other
that
they
would
slip
away
early
but
one
thing
after
another
kept
them
and
it
was
bedtime
before
they
started
oh
i
so
dreadfully
disappointed
wailed
katie
i
wo
be
able
to
sleep
a
wink
for
wondering
how
that
story
is
going
to
end
we
never
have
such
a
good
chance
to
finish
it
again
said
allison
and
even
if
ida
should
loan
us
the
book
we
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
if
she
could
read
it
to
us
her
reading
adds
so
much
to
it
kitty
expressed
the
same
opinion
and
openly
envied
lloyd
and
betty
who
being
in
the
same
building
might
have
future
opportunities
which
would
be
denied
them
at
last
ida
proposed
that
they
finish
the
book
after
the
curfew
signal
and
preparations
were
hastily
made
as
soon
as
kitty
and
katie
were
ready
for
bed
they
took
possession
as
before
of
lloyd
bed
lloyd
and
betty
climbed
into
the
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
allison
carried
blankets
and
pillows
from
the
next
room
to
the
divan
where
she
made
herself
comfortable
and
ida
putting
a
heavy
woollen
bathrobe
over
her
and
stretching
out
in
a
with
a
shawl
over
her
began
to
read
there
was
a
golf
cape
draped
over
the
transom
paper
was
stuffed
in
the
keyholes
the
outside
shutters
were
tightly
closed
the
blinds
drawn
and
the
curtains
pinned
together
over
them
so
that
not
a
single
telltale
ray
of
light
could
betray
them
to
the
outside
world
three
lamps
stood
in
a
row
on
the
table
so
that
they
might
be
burned
in
turn
and
no
one
of
them
be
found
with
the
oil
entirely
consumed
in
the
morning
everywhere
in
the
big
building
was
silence
and
sleep
save
in
that
one
room
in
the
west
wing
there
ida
voice
went
musically
on
and
with
eyes
wide
open
and
every
sense
alert
the
girls
lay
and
listened
the
rain
still
poured
on
and
the
wind
rattled
the
casements
the
clock
struck
ten
eleven
twelve
but
not
till
the
rang
out
in
the
last
chapter
from
the
steeple
of
the
little
stone
church
in
the
english
village
did
they
lose
interest
for
a
moment
in
the
fortunes
of
daisy
dale
the
beautiful
ending
was
something
for
them
to
dream
over
for
weeks
it
was
sunday
morning
before
ida
and
the
three
guests
stole
to
their
rooms
and
crept
shivering
between
the
cold
sheets
chapter
x
a
plot
if
there
anything
i
it
a
sneak
and
a
telltale
the
little
colonel
voice
rang
out
so
clearly
that
the
girls
in
the
stopped
to
listen
it
was
monday
morning
and
the
pupils
were
assembling
in
the
chapel
for
opening
exercises
lloyd
stood
near
the
door
the
centre
of
an
indignant
little
group
which
cast
scornful
glances
at
another
little
group
whispering
together
by
one
of
the
windows
it
the
most
contemptible
thing
that
evah
happened
in
the
seminary
lloyd
continued
it
a
disgrace
to
have
such
a
girl
in
school
katie
who
had
been
anxiously
watching
the
door
for
the
last
five
minutes
for
the
appearance
of
allison
and
kitty
suddenly
exclaimed
there
they
are
now
hanging
up
their
wraps
let
hurry
and
tell
them
before
school
begins
the
next
instant
the
two
late
comers
found
themselves
in
a
corner
hemmed
in
by
betty
katie
and
lloyd
all
so
indignant
that
they
could
scarcely
make
themselves
understood
girls
began
lloyd
in
a
voice
quavering
with
anger
you
nevah
heard
anything
so
outrageous
satahday
aftahnoon
all
that
time
we
were
making
fudge
up
in
our
room
somebody
was
hiding
in
the
closet
next
to
ours
listening
to
every
word
we
said
how
do
you
know
gasped
kitty
remembering
with
dismay
several
speeches
she
had
made
which
would
sound
decidedly
foolish
if
repeated
lollie
briggs
said
so
we
hardly
got
into
the
room
this
mawning
when
some
of
the
girls
began
to
laugh
and
repeat
every
word
we
had
said
it
all
over
the
school
about
our
shadow
club
chimed
in
betty
and
think
how
hard
we
tried
to
keep
it
secret
and
the
very
girls
who
would
have
been
glad
to
join
if
they
had
been
invited
in
the
first
place
are
making
fun
of
it
they
keep
pointing
to
the
ground
behind
us
and
pretend
to
be
amazed
at
what
they
see
there
of
course
they
are
referring
to
our
shadows
for
they
make
all
sorts
of
spiteful
little
side
remarks
about
them
but
there
something
worse
than
that
added
katie
almost
tearfully
i
never
hear
the
last
of
the
speech
i
made
about
charlie
downs
and
the
initials
oh
you
just
wait
they
got
hold
of
every
foolish
little
thing
we
teased
each
other
about
that
afternoon
guy
ferris
valentine
and
brass
button
and
the
little
silver
arrow
malcolm
maclntyre
gave
lloyd
years
ago
and
all
we
said
about
the
way
we
like
to
be
proposed
to
you
know
when
we
were
talking
about
the
of
daisy
dale
they
telling
it
all
over
the
school
and
making
us
appear
too
ridiculous
for
any
use
who
could
be
mean
enough
to
hide
and
listen
exclaimed
allison
indignantly
the
sneak
say
snake
while
you
about
it
hissed
kitty
they
spelled
with
the
same
letters
we
have
any
idea
answered
betty
or
why
the
girls
who
are
doing
the
most
teasing
and
talking
should
take
such
a
spiteful
pleasure
in
it
they
seemed
so
friendly
always
until
this
morning
come
girls
called
clelling
in
passing
it
time
for
the
silence
bell
hurrying
out
of
the
they
took
their
places
in
chapel
and
obediently
opened
their
at
the
signal
but
it
is
doubtful
if
any
member
of
the
shadow
club
could
have
told
afterward
what
was
sung
that
morning
the
letter
in
ida
which
lloyd
had
smuggled
to
her
soon
after
breakfast
on
her
return
from
the
absorbed
all
her
thoughts
the
other
five
girls
were
busy
with
the
one
question
who
could
have
been
such
a
sneak
as
to
listen
and
tell
there
were
six
bad
records
in
every
recitation
that
the
club
made
that
morning
notes
flew
back
and
forth
and
anxious
eyes
watched
the
clock
eager
for
recess
to
come
at
the
first
signal
lloyd
flew
to
ida
but
before
she
could
outline
the
plan
of
action
she
and
allison
had
decided
upon
in
the
history
class
ida
said
hurriedly
oh
princess
that
letter
has
upset
me
so
i
do
know
whether
i
walking
on
earth
or
air
i
tell
you
something
awfully
important
but
i
got
to
plan
something
now
so
i
must
go
off
by
myself
and
put
on
my
oh
i
all
in
a
flutter
wondering
what
news
the
letter
could
have
contained
to
bring
such
a
becoming
flush
to
ida
face
and
such
a
glow
of
happiness
in
the
beautiful
violet
eyes
lloyd
turned
away
disappointed
but
she
forgot
both
the
wonder
and
the
disappointment
a
few
minutes
later
as
she
and
allison
walked
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
seminary
arm
in
arm
kitty
and
katie
were
just
behind
them
betty
had
not
yet
come
out
having
stopped
at
the
sight
of
janie
clung
tears
to
explain
a
problem
in
arithmetic
lollie
briggs
flynn
willis
and
caddie
bailey
stood
on
the
front
steps
and
each
girl
who
came
out
of
the
hall
was
called
into
their
midst
and
told
something
with
many
significant
glances
toward
the
four
pacing
back
and
forth
past
them
in
a
fine
unconcern
presently
caddie
called
out
in
a
voice
intended
for
them
to
hear
i
wonder
if
anybody
can
guess
this
conundrum
nell
can
you
the
question
was
addressed
to
one
of
the
older
girls
who
came
out
of
the
front
door
just
then
without
a
wrap
around
her
it
was
a
frosty
morning
and
every
one
else
had
either
a
jacket
or
cloak
wait
till
i
run
back
and
get
my
golf
cape
she
cried
i
did
know
it
was
so
cold
now
look
out
whispered
allison
to
lloyd
they
going
to
say
something
to
her
to
try
to
set
her
against
us
they
stopping
everybody
who
comes
out
that
makes
eight
already
they
set
to
whispering
and
looking
at
us
all
standing
there
in
that
crowd
on
the
steps
nell
came
out
again
hugging
her
golf
cape
around
her
and
stood
on
the
top
step
well
what
your
conundrum
she
asked
caddie
slightly
raised
her
voice
what
the
difference
between
a
person
who
would
stoop
to
so
common
as
a
and
a
person
who
would
get
up
a
club
pretending
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
and
yet
all
the
time
be
using
it
simply
as
an
excuse
to
meet
and
read
silly
novels
on
the
sly
and
talk
about
the
boys
and
roast
the
other
girls
behind
their
backs
whom
they
considered
common
to
associate
with
them
in
a
flash
lloyd
realized
what
had
offended
caddie
and
what
was
the
cause
of
her
covert
sneers
whoever
it
was
who
had
played
the
sneak
had
taken
pains
to
report
every
word
she
had
said
about
the
girls
who
had
played
pillow
at
carter
brown
party
she
looked
around
to
see
who
had
been
the
most
active
in
denouncing
the
club
there
they
were
on
the
steps
flynn
willis
caddie
bailey
lollie
briggs
all
but
mittie
dupong
the
same
girls
she
had
called
common
because
they
had
allowed
the
boys
to
take
a
liberty
which
she
thought
cheapened
them
she
knew
now
why
they
were
so
spiteful
in
their
remarks
before
nell
could
gather
her
wits
together
for
a
reply
lloyd
sprang
forward
her
eyes
flashing
why
do
you
come
straight
out
and
say
what
you
mean
cad
bailey
she
cried
you
only
telling
part
of
the
truth
now
i
tell
it
all
i
did
say
behind
your
backs
that
i
thought
it
was
common
to
play
and
now
i
say
it
to
yoah
faces
i
ca
help
thinking
it
i
been
brought
up
that
way
and
if
you
been
brought
up
differently
then
you
a
right
to
think
yoah
way
if
i
hurt
yoah
feelings
i
beg
yoah
pahdon
but
i
have
a
right
to
express
my
opinion
in
my
own
room
to
my
best
friends
we
were
anybody
we
only
made
a
criticism
that
you
must
expect
to
have
made
on
you
whenevah
you
do
things
that
are
common
and
what
are
you
going
to
say
about
the
person
who
hid
and
listened
all
aftahnoon
was
sneak
enough
not
only
to
hide
in
a
closet
and
betray
secrets
that
no
girl
of
honah
would
have
listened
to
but
she
misrepresented
the
club
in
repeating
them
lloyd
temper
was
rapidly
getting
the
best
of
her
but
in
the
middle
of
her
anger
she
seemed
to
hear
her
father
saying
in
the
playful
way
in
which
he
used
to
warn
her
long
ago
look
out
little
daughter
the
tiger
is
getting
loose
she
stopped
short
who
did
that
cried
nell
i
did
suppose
there
was
such
a
dishonourable
girl
in
the
school
neither
did
i
answered
flynn
willis
quickly
i
never
stopped
to
ask
how
the
report
started
i
was
so
mad
at
being
talked
about
that
i
did
just
what
cad
bailey
told
me
to
do
repeated
everything
i
was
told
just
to
tease
the
club
and
get
even
all
eyes
were
turned
inquiringly
to
caddie
bailey
i
do
know
how
it
started
she
cried
honestly
i
do
lollie
briggs
told
me
she
and
several
girls
were
talking
about
it
this
morning
before
breakfast
out
in
the
hall
they
were
all
furious
and
they
told
me
lots
of
things
to
say
that
would
tease
lloyd
and
the
rest
of
them
nearly
to
death
i
was
mad
too
but
i
do
know
who
told
in
the
first
place
it
was
you
lollie
briggs
who
told
me
that
somebody
had
hid
in
the
clark
girls
closet
cried
lloyd
you
know
you
did
when
i
demanded
to
know
who
had
started
all
this
talk
who
was
it
i
promised
i
would
tell
said
lollie
sullenly
and
i
wo
you
need
ask
for
no
power
on
earth
could
drag
it
out
of
me
so
there
it
like
the
story
of
chicken
little
laughed
nell
told
you
who
told
you
who
told
you
seems
to
me
i
make
it
my
business
to
find
out
who
this
particularly
contemptible
chicken
little
happens
to
be
before
i
report
any
more
of
her
tales
nell
swept
back
into
the
hall
and
as
the
four
girls
started
to
resume
their
walk
betty
knocked
on
the
window
beckoning
violently
for
them
to
come
inside
they
ran
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
i
found
out
cried
betty
in
a
tragic
whisper
it
was
mittie
dupong
cassie
found
her
on
their
closet
floor
and
just
now
brought
it
down
to
her
she
denied
it
was
hers
but
there
no
mistaking
that
queer
little
and
chain
fastened
to
it
that
she
uses
as
a
guard
she
the
only
one
in
school
who
has
one
like
that
an
owl
head
in
a
wishbone
you
know
besides
there
were
her
initials
on
the
under
side
of
the
badge
cassie
turned
it
over
and
showed
them
to
her
she
took
it
then
but
denied
having
been
in
the
closet
and
was
so
confused
and
contradicted
herself
so
many
times
that
anybody
could
see
that
she
felt
caught
and
was
telling
a
story
she
even
vowed
that
she
had
been
near
the
west
wing
for
a
week
then
she
ran
out
and
banged
the
door
but
janie
clung
said
what
a
story
i
met
her
coming
out
of
there
saturday
night
on
the
way
down
to
supper
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
about
it
asked
katie
that
was
a
question
no
one
could
answer
in
the
first
flush
of
their
indignation
it
seemed
to
them
that
nothing
they
could
do
to
mittie
would
be
sufficient
punishment
for
such
an
act
of
meanness
they
felt
that
she
was
a
disgrace
to
the
school
and
decided
that
they
would
be
conferring
a
benefit
on
the
seminary
if
they
could
succeed
in
getting
rid
of
her
even
betty
failed
for
the
time
to
remember
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
she
was
trying
to
leave
behind
her
in
every
one
memory
and
if
the
little
talisman
on
her
finger
pricked
her
tender
conscience
once
or
twice
she
silenced
it
with
the
reflection
that
it
was
her
duty
to
help
punish
the
doer
of
such
a
contemptible
deed
the
name
of
the
club
finally
suggested
the
means
she
told
all
the
secrets
of
the
shadow
club
and
spoiled
it
said
katie
now
we
just
ought
to
shadow
haunt
her
you
know
like
the
ku
klux
klan
or
the
white
caps
so
she
leave
school
and
be
afraid
to
listen
again
as
long
as
she
lives
yes
agreed
kitty
we
her
that
is
the
way
such
a
plan
never
would
have
been
thought
of
in
a
northern
school
even
in
this
little
kentucky
seminary
it
is
doubtful
if
it
could
have
been
carried
out
had
not
previous
events
paved
the
way
there
was
scarcely
a
pupil
in
the
school
whose
earliest
impressions
had
not
been
tinged
in
some
degree
by
the
superstitions
of
some
old
coloured
nurse
or
family
servant
even
lloyd
had
not
escaped
them
entirely
in
spite
of
all
her
mother
watchful
care
mom
beck
knew
better
than
to
talk
of
such
things
openly
before
her
but
she
had
hinted
of
them
to
the
other
servants
in
her
presence
till
lloyd
had
a
vague
uneasiness
when
she
dreamed
of
muddy
water
or
spilled
the
salt
or
saw
a
bird
flying
against
a
window
from
babyhood
such
happenings
had
been
associated
in
her
mind
with
mom
beck
portents
of
there
was
not
a
coloured
person
in
the
neighbourhood
who
could
have
explained
why
so
many
graves
in
the
negro
cemetery
had
bottles
or
placed
upon
them
inside
of
which
were
carefully
sealed
the
whitest
of
chicken
feathers
undoubtedly
they
were
the
relic
of
some
old
african
fetish
and
a
reverence
for
them
had
been
handed
down
from
grizzled
grandsire
to
little
pickaninny
since
the
beginning
of
the
in
the
same
way
had
come
all
those
other
superstitions
at
which
white
people
laughed
but
which
influenced
many
of
them
also
to
some
extent
for
many
a
man
who
scoffed
most
felt
more
comfortable
when
he
saw
the
new
moon
in
an
open
sky
than
when
he
caught
first
sight
of
it
through
the
trees
and
more
than
one
having
once
started
on
a
journey
would
not
have
turned
back
no
matter
what
important
thing
was
left
behind
preferring
to
do
without
at
any
cost
or
inconvenience
rather
than
risk
the
the
turning
back
would
bring
lloyd
knew
more
than
one
housekeeper
in
the
neighbourhood
who
for
the
same
reason
would
not
allow
the
ashes
emptied
after
sundown
or
an
umbrella
to
be
raised
in
the
house
and
who
would
turn
pale
if
a
mirror
was
broken
or
a
picture
fell
from
the
wall
or
a
dog
howled
in
the
night
probably
not
a
pupil
in
the
school
would
have
admitted
that
she
believed
in
ghosts
yet
few
would
have
been
brave
enough
to
venture
into
the
cellar
at
night
after
mary
phillips
encounter
with
the
spirit
of
the
veiled
lady
on
that
had
been
a
frequent
topic
of
conversation
since
that
night
and
had
done
much
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
plot
the
club
concocted
so
kitty
proposition
was
received
with
enthusiasm
the
performance
began
next
day
when
she
slipped
up
behind
mittie
in
the
and
solemnly
touched
her
three
times
in
quick
succession
on
the
left
ear
with
something
she
held
in
her
hand
it
felt
soft
and
furry
and
mittie
who
had
a
horror
of
caterpillars
gave
a
little
shriek
as
she
put
up
her
handkerchief
to
brush
it
away
kitty
had
already
disappeared
into
the
chapel
but
katie
was
waiting
ready
to
begin
her
part
of
the
performance
did
you
see
that
she
said
to
janie
clung
in
an
awed
tone
just
loud
enough
for
mittie
to
hear
and
yet
low
enough
to
seem
confidential
i
know
people
who
would
go
stark
raving
crazy
if
that
was
done
to
them
what
for
i
thought
everybody
knew
what
for
my
old
nurse
used
to
say
that
to
be
touched
three
times
on
the
ear
by
the
left
hind
foot
of
a
rabbit
that
had
been
killed
in
a
graveyard
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
by
a
person
was
the
worst
luck
anybody
could
have
she
lowered
her
voice
a
trifle
a
you
marked
for
the
haunts
to
follow
you
the
what
asked
another
girl
who
stood
near
the
haunts
ghosts
you
know
jim
briddle
calls
them
nobody
could
be
more
than
he
is
and
he
the
one
who
gave
that
rabbit
foot
to
ranald
walton
and
ranald
gave
it
to
kitty
i
should
think
that
mittie
dupong
would
feel
mighty
creepy
if
she
knew
ahead
of
her
mittie
heard
and
did
feel
creepy
although
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
tried
hard
to
appear
unconcerned
the
fact
that
the
club
seemed
to
place
so
much
reliance
in
the
hoodoo
made
a
strong
impression
on
janie
clung
and
gave
it
a
weight
it
would
not
have
possessed
otherwise
when
the
occurrence
was
repeated
to
the
other
girls
before
the
week
was
over
it
was
whispered
around
the
school
that
the
charm
was
really
working
chapter
xi
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
every
day
since
the
first
of
november
there
had
been
a
letter
for
ida
in
the
sherman
box
under
cover
of
lloyd
address
lloyd
had
grown
to
dread
the
afternoon
walks
with
the
school
for
she
was
in
a
flutter
of
nervousness
from
the
moment
they
came
in
sight
of
the
until
the
letter
was
safe
in
ida
possession
there
was
always
the
fear
that
betty
might
get
to
the
window
first
or
that
she
might
catch
sight
of
the
envelope
addressed
with
many
flourishes
in
a
big
bold
hand
or
that
that
letter
might
be
the
only
one
as
it
often
was
and
betty
might
wonder
why
lloyd
face
should
grow
so
red
when
she
answered
no
nothing
for
us
this
time
it
was
easier
to
manage
after
the
weather
turned
cold
enough
to
furnish
an
excuse
for
carrying
a
muff
but
even
then
she
fancied
that
miss
mattie
looked
at
her
curiously
sometimes
when
she
thrust
the
daily
letter
hastily
out
of
sight
without
a
second
glance
she
never
went
through
the
performance
without
wishing
that
it
might
be
the
last
time
that
she
should
be
placed
in
such
an
uncomfortable
position
but
afterward
she
always
reproached
herself
for
making
such
a
wish
it
seemed
a
very
poor
friendship
that
could
not
stand
a
little
test
like
that
it
was
such
a
small
thing
to
do
when
the
happiness
of
her
whole
life
was
at
stake
then
she
had
her
reward
in
the
evenings
when
ida
with
her
arms
around
her
whispered
her
undying
gratitude
or
read
her
extracts
from
her
letters
which
gave
her
glimpses
into
a
romance
far
more
beautiful
than
the
fortunes
of
daisy
dale
or
the
heiress
of
dorn
or
any
of
the
others
they
had
read
since
a
sort
of
circulating
library
had
started
since
the
rainy
night
the
shadow
club
read
its
first
volume
ida
had
a
pile
of
books
in
her
closet
which
she
pronounced
fully
as
interesting
as
the
one
she
had
read
aloud
so
elsie
wooing
fair
but
false
and
the
heiress
of
dorn
began
passing
in
turn
from
the
covers
of
katie
geography
to
kitty
and
from
lloyd
history
to
betty
and
allison
they
read
at
recess
they
read
before
school
and
more
than
once
some
exciting
chapter
proved
too
interesting
to
be
laid
aside
in
study
time
for
the
work
of
the
hour
after
a
few
volumes
of
such
tales
betty
became
fired
with
an
ambition
to
write
one
herself
and
soon
became
so
absorbed
in
her
pastime
that
she
could
think
of
little
else
eugene
was
the
name
of
her
hero
and
gladys
was
the
maiden
who
combined
all
the
beauty
and
virtues
possible
for
one
mundane
creature
to
possess
the
whole
club
was
consulted
as
to
the
colour
of
her
eyes
and
hair
and
many
points
about
which
the
little
author
was
undecided
they
came
in
time
to
regard
eugene
and
gladys
as
real
personages
in
whom
they
had
a
family
interest
lloyd
had
bits
of
the
story
read
to
her
sometimes
when
they
were
getting
ready
for
bed
betty
lost
interest
in
everything
to
such
an
extent
that
she
ceased
to
be
sociable
and
spent
most
of
her
time
alone
dreaming
out
different
scenes
in
the
story
which
filled
her
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
even
her
lessons
one
afternoon
near
the
middle
of
november
lloyd
hurrying
through
the
lower
hall
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
met
the
president
oh
doctah
wells
she
exclaimed
i
was
just
going
to
yoah
room

a
note

she

to

aftah
school
with
a
message
to
the
servants
about
packing
them
if
you
excuse
us
from
the
regulah
promenade
certainly
he
answered
glancing
over
sherman
gracefully
written
request
but
betty
has
such
a
bad
cold
continued
lloyd
that
the
matron
thinks
she
ought
to
go
out
to
walk
and
it
lonely
going
back
home
by
myself
when
it
all
shut
up
may
i
take
ida
shane
with
me
instead
she
nevah
seen
locust
from
the
inside
and
i
love
to
show
it
to
her
you
know
a
little
smile
dimpling
her
face
as
she
spoke
i
ca
help
being
proud
of
the
old
place
you
have
good
reason
said
the
professor
smiling
back
at
her
kindly

is
certainly
a
beautiful
old
homestead
yes
i
have
no
objection
to
ida
going
with
you
oh

cried
lloyd
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
ida
room
calling
excitedly
as
she
reached
the
door
yes
he
says
you
may
go
hurry
and
put
on
your
things
so
that
we
can
have
as
long
time
as
possible
up
there
betty
had
gone
into
the
matron
room
in
her
absence
it
took
lloyd
only
a
moment
to
slip
into
her
hat
and
coat
then
catching
up
her
muff
and
thrusting
it
under
her
arm
she
started
back
to
ida
room
buttoning
her
gloves
as
she
went
ida
had
taken
down
her
hair
and
was
deliberately
rearranging
it
before
the
mirror
oh
what
did
you
do
that
for
cried
lloyd
it
looked
all
right
as
it
was
we
not
going
to
see
any
one
but
the
servants
there
no
use
wearing
your
best
hat
she
glanced
at
the
mass
of
velvet
and
plumes
lying
on
the
bed
just
pin
your
hair
up
any
fashion
and
stick
on
your
that
do
shut
the
door
please
said
ida
in
a
low
tone
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
bent
nearer
the
mirror
drawing
the
comb
through
the
fluffy
pompadour
we
going
to
see
some
one
this
afternoon
is
in
the
lloyd
dropped
her
muff
at
this
surprising
announcement
but
ida
went
on
calmly
i
been
expecting
him
for
several
days
he
comes
to
lloydsboro
sometimes
to
visit
his
cousin
i
lain
awake
nights
trying
to
arrange
some
way
to
see
him
this
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
any
way
i
could
think
of
i
the
luckiest
girl
that
ever
lived
to
have
such
a
friend
as
you
to
plan
for
me
princess
i
do
know
what
you
mean
exclaimed
lloyd
i
have
planned
anything
no
not
intentionally
but
look
how
easy
you
have
made
it
for
me
to
have
an
interview
he
be
on
the
watch
for
the
seminary
girls
to
pass
by
the
store
for
i
was
to
manage
to
leave
a
note
there
for
him
telling
him
where
i
can
see
him
all
i
have
to
do
now
is
to
signal
him
to
follow
and
we
can
have
a
good
long
talk
at
locust
while
you
are
giving
the
servants
their
orders
you
do
mind
do
you
she
asked
as
lloyd
continued
to
stare
at
her
without
saying
anything
no
oh
no
of
not
answered
lloyd
with
a
confused
laugh
only
it
makes
me
feel
so
to
think
that
i
really
going
to
see
him
it
just
as
if
lord
rokeby
or
the
squire
son
had
stepped
out
of
the
book
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
a
book
myself
since
you
told
me
that
this
is
the
way
it
would
be
on
the
page
if
we
could
stand
off
and
read
about
ourselves
violet
little
friend
led
the
way
down
the
long
avenue
and
there
on
the
threshold
of
her
home
after
months
of
cruel
separation
the
reunited
lovers
kept
their
tryst
ida
laughed
happily
you
have
a
book
written
before
betty
is
if
you
go
on
at
that
rate
now
tell
me
do
i
look
all
right
she
was
settling
the
big
in
place
over
her
soft
hair
as
she
anxiously
asked
the
question
lloyd
regarded
her
critically
tipping
her
head
a
trifle
to
one
side
as
she
looked
put
your
hat
a
hairbreadth
farther
over
your
face
she
exclaimed
there
that
lovely
oh
violet
that
shade
of
velvet
is
becoming
to
you
it
just
the
colah
of
yoah
eyes
i
nevah
saw
you
look
so
beautiful
a
becoming
pink
flushed
ida
cheeks
she
bent
her
head
over
the
bunch
of
violets
pinned
on
the
lapel
of
her
coat
it
dear
of
you
to
think
so
she
said
and
it
dear
of
you
to
send
me
these
violets
every
week
these
are
unusually
sweet
i
so
glad
i
have
a
fresh
bunch
for
this
happy
day
lloyd
took
the
keenest
delight
in
watching
the
graceful
girl
sweep
down
the
hall
ahead
of
her
from
the
plumes
of
the
to
the
hem
of
her
stylish
gown
she
thoroughly
satisfied
lloyd
artistic
instinct
for
the
beautiful
she
gave
her
arm
an
adoring
little
squeeze
as
they
passed
down
the
stairs
together
out
on
the
road
she
glanced
up
at
ida
again
happiness
had
not
made
her
radiant
as
it
did
daisy
dale
but
there
was
a
soft
light
in
the
violet
eyes
which
made
lloyd
think
of
a
picture
she
had
seen
of
a
vestal
maiden
on
her
way
to
guard
the
holy
altar
fires
lloyd
heart
began
to
beat
faster
as
she
realized
that
every
step
was
taking
them
nearer
to
edwardo
she
pictured
him
again
in
her
imagination
as
she
had
done
so
many
times
before
she
would
know
that
pale
serious
face
with
its
flashing
eyes
anywhere
she
might
meet
him
she
was
sure
neither
of
them
spoke
as
they
hurried
along
the
path
through
the
lower
part
of
clovercroft
and
pushed
open
the
woodland
gate
but
as
they
stepped
up
on
the
platform
in
front
of
the
depot
lloyd
said
cross
the
track
heah
and
go
up
on
the
othah
side
of
the
road
then
we
not
have
to
pass
the
there
always
so
many
people
loafing
around
the
window
of
the
instinctively
she
felt
that
while
a
little
girl
like
herself
would
attract
no
attention
ida
in
her
long
sweeping
dress
that
she
held
up
so
gracefully
and
the
big
hat
drooping
over
her
pretty
face
and
the
stylish
fur
collar
and
the
violets
on
her
coat
made
a
picture
that
any
one
would
turn
to
look
at
twice
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
bold
glances
that
might
be
cast
after
her
by
the
loafers
around
the
depot
it
seemed
to
her
little
short
of
sacrilege
although
she
could
not
have
put
the
feeling
into
words
for
any
eyes
but
edwardo
to
rest
upon
her
as
she
went
on
her
way
to
this
meeting
with
that
look
upon
her
face
very
well
assented
ida
you
know
we
want
to
stop
at
the
store
i
want
to
get
some
chocolate
creams
if
they
have
any
fresh
ones
illustration
he
held
it
aside
for
them
both
to
pass
through
lloyd
heart
gave
a
frightened
thump
as
she
remembered
that
it
was
in
the
store
that
edwardo
would
be
watching
presently
for
the
seminary
girls
to
go
by
it
was
half
an
hour
earlier
than
they
usually
passed
but
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
might
be
there
in
less
than
a
minute
she
might
be
face
to
face
with
the
live
hero
of
a
real
romance
it
was
with
an
odd
feeling
of
mingled
relief
and
disappointment
that
she
glanced
around
the
store
and
saw
only
familiar
faces
a
young
man
whom
she
knew
by
sight
was
perched
on
the
bookkeeper
high
stool
at
the
back
of
the
store
so
absorbed
in
the
louisville
evening
paper
which
the
last
had
brought
out
that
he
did
not
look
up
a
small
coloured
boy
stood
patiently
by
the
stove
waiting
for
his
can
to
be
filled
one
of
the
clerks
was
tying
up
a
package
of
groceries
for
frazer
to
carry
over
to
clovercroft
and
the
other
was
showing
ginghams
to
walton
barbry
be
with
you
in
a
moment
please
called
the
first
clerk
as
the
girls
entered
lloyd
stopped
in
front
of
the
near
the
door
and
began
idly
examining
the
various
styles
of
jewelry
and
displayed
within
she
had
almost
decided
to
invest
in
a
certain
little
enamelled
pin
which
she
knew
would
delight
mom
beck
and
take
it
up
to
her
as
a
surprise
when
barbry
stepped
beside
her
with
a
polite
greeting
and
an
inquiry
about
her
grandfather
health
while
she
was
still
talking
with
barbry
ida
came
up
flushed
and
excited
she
thrust
her
bag
of
chocolates
into
her
muff
and
catching
up
her
skirts
said
hurriedly
come
on
i
ready
lloyd
started
at
once
to
follow
her
to
the
door
but
looked
back
to
nod
assent
to
barbry
last
remark
and
in
turning
again
almost
ran
into
the
young
fellow
who
had
been
reading
at
the
bookkeeper
desk
he
was
hurrying
after
ida
to
open
the
door
for
her
he
held
it
aside
for
them
both
to
pass
through
and
a
flush
of
displeasure
dyed
lloyd
face
as
she
saw
the
admiring
glance
he
cast
boldly
at
ida
he
need
have
gone
so
far
out
of
his
way
to
have
done
that
exclaimed
lloyd
as
they
started
up
the
road
toward
locust
it
was
the
clerk
place
to
open
the
doah
and
he
nearly
knocked
him
down
trying
to
get
there
first
who
inquired
ida
innocently
she
was
several
steps
in
advance
and
could
not
see
lloyd
face
that
horrid
mistah
ned
bannon
i
ca
him
papa
jack
told
mothah
she
must
nevah
invite
him
to
the
house
undah
any
circumstances
because
he
was
fit
for
betty
and
me
to
know
and
she
stopped
abruptly
for
ida
turned
with
a
white
pained
face
oh
lloyd
she
cried
how
can
you
hurt
me
so
do
believe
any
of
those
dreadful
things
you
hear
about
him
then
seeing
from
amazed
expression
that
she
failed
to
understand
the
situation
she
added
in
a
distressed
tone
is
if
ida
had
struck
her
on
the
face
she
could
not
have
been
more
amazed
she
stood
staring
at
her
helplessly
unable
to
say
a
word
i
must
be
dreaming
all
this
she
thought
after
awhile
i
surely
wake
up
and
find
i
had
a
horrible
nightmare
but
the
distress
in
ida
voice
was
too
real
to
be
a
dream
she
was
biting
her
lips
to
keep
back
the
tears
after
one
look
into
dismayed
face
she
turned
away
and
began
moving
slowly
on
toward
locust
lloyd
walked
beside
her
mechanically
she
could
not
shake
off
the
feeling
that
she
must
be
in
a
dream
from
time
to
time
she
cast
a
glance
toward
ida
she
felt
that
she
had
wounded
her
so
deeply
that
nothing
she
might
say
could
ever
make
amends
when
she
saw
a
tear
course
slowly
down
her
cheek
and
splash
down
on
the
bunch
of
flowers
on
her
coat
she
clasped
her
arm
impulsively
saying
oh
violet
deah
cry
i
would
have
hurt
you
for
worlds
i
have
the
faintest
idea
that
was
the
one
it
is
so
much
what
you
said
answered
ida
controlling
her
voice
with
an
effort
but
i
counted
so
much
on
your
friendship
for
him
and
now
to
know
that
people
have
prejudiced
you
against
him
before
had
a
chance
to
meet
him
and
find
out
for
yourself
that
mistaken
she
stopped
with
a
sob
under
all
his
wild
ways
he
good
and
noble
and
true
at
heart
and
it
is
fair
for
everybody
to
condemn
him
for
what
he
has
done
and
stand
in
his
way
when
he
trying
so
hard
to
do
better
one
little
hand
in
the
muff
was
bare
and
lloyd
saw
the
gleam
of
the
pearl
on
it
as
ida
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
dabbed
it
hastily
across
her
eyes
it
brought
back
all
that
scene
in
the
moonlighted
orchard
and
ida
blushing
confession
he
says
that
is
what
my
life
means
to
him
a
pearl
that
if
it
was
for
my
love
and
prayers
he
would
care
what
became
of
him
or
what
he
did
do
you
blame
me
for
disregarding
aunt
wishes
and
again
as
on
that
night
the
little
colonel
heart
swelled
with
an
indignant
no
again
she
arrayed
herself
beside
her
friend
ready
to
do
battle
for
her
against
the
whole
world
if
necessary
wonderfully
comforted
by
lloyd
protests
of
sympathy
and
understanding
ida
dried
her
eyes
and
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
saying
he
not
in
sight
yet
i
told
him
not
to
start
for
fifteen
minutes
and
then
to
come
the
long
way
around
through
tanglewood
so
nobody
could
think
he
was
following
us
that
will
give
you
time
to
show
me
over
the
house
as
lloyd
swung
open
the
entrance
gate
and
started
down
the
long
avenue
a
queer
feeling
crept
over
her
that
she
could
not
have
expressed
had
she
tried
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
old
trees
were
almost
human
and
stretched
out
their
bare
branches
toward
her
with
an
offering
of
protection
and
welcome
that
was
like
the
greeting
of
old
friends
yet
at
the
same
time
she
felt
the
silent
challenge
of
these
old
family
sentinels
and
involuntarily
answered
it
by
a
slight
lifting
of
the
head
and
a
trifle
more
erectness
of
carriage
as
she
passed
they
seemed
to
expect
it
of
her
that
she
should
walk
past
them
as
all
the
lloyds
had
walked
with
the
proud
consciousness
that
none
could
gainsay
their
countersign
of
gentle
birth
and
breeding
which
spoke
even
in
their
tread
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
back
to
locust
since
the
beginning
of
school
and
ida
felt
some
subtle
change
in
her
as
soon
as
they
passed
inside
the
great
gate
the
little
colonel
personality
asserted
itself
as
it
had
not
at
the
seminary
there
she
was
ida
adoring
little
shadow
completely
under
the
spell
of
her
influence
here
swayed
by
the
stronger
influence
of
old
associations
she
was
herself
again
the
same
imperious
little
creature
that
she
was
when
she
first
coolly
bearded
the
lion
in
his
den
the
douglas
in
his
hall
and
brought
the
old
colonel
to
unconditional
surrender
mom
beck
came
up
from
the
servants
cottage
and
unlocked
the
house
for
them
and
after
reading
her
the
list
of
articles
to
be
packed
lloyd
left
her
in
the
and
began
a
tour
of
the
house
in
the
pleasure
of
acting
as
hostess
and
showing
ida
the
attractions
of
locust
she
would
have
forgotten
that
an
unwelcome
guest
was
on
his
way
had
not
ida
restless
glances
from
every
front
window
they
passed
reminded
her
the
quarter
of
an
hour
was
almost
over
when
she
led
the
way
into
the
long
which
she
had
reserved
until
last
of
it
does
look
as
it
does
when
we
are
living
heah
it
makes
such
a
difference
having
the
curtains
down
and
the
furniture
covahed
but
i
want
you
to
see
my
harp
she
i
began
slipping
the
cover
from
the
tall
burnished
frame
it
belonged
to
my
grandmothah
amanthis
and
i
am
proudah
of
it
than
anything
i
own
that
her
portrait
ovah
the
mantel
is
she
beautiful
somehow
i
nevah
can
call
her
just
grandmothah
as
if
she
were
an
old
lady
she
nevah
lived
to
be
one
you
know
i
always
have
to
add
her
name
amanthis
and
i
think
of
her
as
she
looks
there
in
the
pictuah
the
young
girl
she
was
when
grandfathah
first
saw
her
a
june
rose
in
her
hair
and
anothah
at
her
throat
fairest
flowah
in
all
kentucky
he
told
me
once
that
always
seemed
such
a
sweet
romance
to
me
she
was
much
oldah
than
you
when
he
brought
her
here
a
bride
he
always
talks
about
her
when
the
locusts
bloom
for
they
were
in
blossom
then
and
the
avenue
was
white
with
them
lloyd
had
expected
more
outspoken
admiration
from
ida
when
she
showed
her
the
portrait
and
was
disappointed
to
have
her
barely
glance
up
at
it
murmuring
yes
she
is
lovely
in
an
way
and
then
hurry
to
the
window
exclaiming
oh
there
he
is
i
can
see
him
just
coming
in
at
the
gate
lloyd
glance
followed
ida
and
stepping
back
from
the
window
she
began
hastily
drawing
the
cover
over
the
harp
oh
do
put
it
on
yet
said
ida
i
want
to
show
it
to
him
lloyd
hesitated
an
instant
then
stammered
confusedly
but
but
oh
ida
sorry
but
do
you
see
i
ca
ask
him
into
the
house
why
not
cried
ida
you
promised
on
the
way
up
here
you
do
anything
you
could
for
me
tears
of
distress
gathered
in
the
little
colonel
eyes
it
was
impossible
to
answer
ida
question
without
wounding
her
deeply
for
it
was
in
this
very
room
she
had
heard
her
grandfather
say
it
a
pity
cy
bannon
youngest
boy
is
such
a
profligate
why
sir
he
is
worth
the
powder
and
shot
that
would
put
an
end
to
his
worthless
existence
i
would
let
him
darken
my
doors
sir
and
it
was
in
this
room
also
that
she
had
heard
her
father
say
no
elizabeth
for
the
judge
sake
i
like
to
show
ned
some
attention
and
some
families
do
receive
him
but
his
unprincipled
conduct
bars
him
out
here
he
a
fellow
whom
i
never
could
permit
lloyd
to
know
ida
repeated
her
question
oh
violet
cried
lloyd
it
just
breaking
my
heart
to
refuse
you
but
i
ca
let
him
come
in
it
my
house
and
i
no
right
to
when
grandfathah
and
papa
jack
have
both
forbidden
it
but
it
warmah
on
the
than
it
is
in
the
house
with
no
fiah
and
i
put
some
chairs
out
for
you
and
wait
for
you
in
heah
wo
you
even
come
out
and
be
introduced
oh
violet
ask
me
begged
the
little
colonel
i
like
to
for
your
sake
but
i
ca
i
simply
ca
why
not
are
you
going
to
let
your
father
prejudices
stand
in
the
way
he
does
know
him
as
i
do
he
just
taken
a
dislike
to
him
as
aunt
has
done
on
account
of
things
he
heard
it
unfair
it
unjust
to
condemn
him
on
account
of
other
people
mistaken
opinions
and
prejudices
the
little
colonel
wavered
ida
absolute
trust
made
it
seem
possible
that
she
might
be
right
and
everybody
else
mistaken
she
peered
out
of
the
window
again
he
was
up
the
avenue
now
sauntering
along
at
a
leisurely
gait
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
besides
continued
ida
nobody
need
ever
know
you
have
met
him
easy
enough
to
keep
it
secret
so
what
the
difference
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
her
sentence
surprised
by
the
change
in
the
little
colonel
manner
she
had
drawn
herself
up
haughtily
and
in
her
fearless
scorn
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
the
in
gray
in
the
frame
above
her
i
hope
she
said
slowly
that
i
have
too
much
respect
for
the
family
honah
to
do
such
an
undahhanded
thing
as
that
do
you
think
that
i
be
willing
to
be
the
only
one
of
all
the
lloyds
who
could
be
trusted
why
princess
i
do
see
what
changed
you
so
suddenly
said
ida
i
have
asked
you
to
do
anything
more
than
you
been
doing
all
along
by
letting
me
use
your
box
but
i
nevah
would
have
done
that
cried
lloyd
if
i
have
known
who
yoah
edwardo
was
and
now
i
found
out
that
it
is
some
one
that
papa
jack
disapproves
of
of
i
ca
carry
yoah
lettahs
any
moah
oh
princess
i
thought
stand
by
me
against
the
whole
world
sobbed
ida
i
had
counted
so
much
just
these
few
days
he
be
here
in
the
valley
on
seeing
him
up
here
i
did
think
be
unreasonable
and
unjust
it
seems
as
if
it
would
break
my
heart
to
have
my
only
friend
fail
me
now
the
tears
were
streaming
down
lloyd
face
too
but
she
clenched
her
hands
and
shook
her
head
stubbornly
no
tell
him
he
ca
come
heah
again
and
that
he
must
send
any
moah
lettahs
to
my
address
without
another
word
ida
turned
and
walked
out
to
the
porch
where
she
stood
waiting
behind
the
bare
vines
that
twined
the
pillars
for
edwardo
to
come
to
her
all
the
pretty
colour
had
died
out
of
her
face
and
lloyd
felt
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
remorse
that
she
was
responsible
for
the
tears
in
the
beautiful
eyes
and
the
look
of
trouble
on
the
face
that
only
a
little
while
before
had
been
aglow
with
happiness
the
odour
of
a
cigarette
floated
in
through
the
hall
then
ida
closed
the
door
and
the
two
sat
down
on
the
step
outside
lloyd
paced
up
and
down
the
long
room
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
there
was
an
ache
in
her
throat
she
was
so
miserably
disappointed
in
edwardo
so
miserably
sorry
for
ida
more
than
all
she
was
miserably
sorry
for
herself
for
the
friendship
which
she
had
counted
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
of
her
life
lay
in
ruins
for
a
moment
she
doubted
if
she
had
done
right
to
shirk
the
obligations
it
had
laid
upon
her
and
wondered
if
it
were
not
a
greater
sacrifice
than
her
father
ought
to
expect
her
to
make
for
him
the
temptation
pressed
sorely
upon
her
to
go
to
ida
and
tell
her
she
would
stand
by
her
as
she
had
promised
and
for
a
few
days
longer
at
least
be
the
bearer
of
their
letters
she
even
started
toward
the
door
but
across
the
room
some
compelling
force
drew
her
eyes
toward
the
portrait
of
amanthis
and
she
stood
still
looking
into
the
depths
of
the
clear
true
eyes
which
had
given
counsel
to
more
than
one
troubled
heart
years
before
the
old
colonel
standing
with
his
head
bowed
on
the
mantel
had
murmured
brokenly
oh
amanthis
tell
me
what
to
do
and
obedient
to
the
silent
message
of
that
straightforward
gaze
had
started
off
through
the
falling
snow
to
be
reconciled
to
his
only
daughter
and
now
lloyd
looking
up
in
the
same
way
no
longer
had
any
doubts
about
her
duty
it
would
be
right
would
it
she
murmured
nevah
did
anything
you
had
to
hide
would
stoop
to
anything
clandestine
she
straightened
herself
up
proudly
and
wiped
her
eyes
neithah
will
i
no
mattah
what
it
costs
me
not
to
then
she
went
on
brokenly
as
if
talking
to
a
living
presence
oh
it
so
pitiful
for
her
to
be
so
deceived
in
him
for
of
grandfathah
and
papa
jack
and
her
aunt
and
everybody
put
togethah
could
be
mistaken
and
i
love
her
so
much
i
wish
mothah
were
here
or
papa
jack
but
i
promise
grandmothah
amanthis
i
nevah
make
you
ashamed
of
me
again
i
would
have
carried
the
lettahs
if
i
had
known
and
you
can
trust
me
always
aftah
this
for
evah
and
evah
it
seemed
to
lloyd
that
an
approving
smile
rested
on
the
girlish
face
and
a
red
streak
of
light
from
the
wintry
sunset
stealing
in
through
the
uncurtained
window
shone
across
the
june
rose
at
her
throat
till
it
burned
for
the
moment
with
the
live
red
of
a
living
rose
she
slipped
the
cover
on
the
harp
again
and
taking
one
more
look
around
the
room
at
every
familiar
object
grown
dear
from
years
of
happy
associations
she
closed
the
door
softly
and
stole
to
rejoin
mom
beck
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
to
a
funeral
and
had
suddenly
grown
very
old
and
worldly
wise
years
older
and
wiser
than
when
she
started
blithely
up
to
locust
an
hour
or
two
before
it
was
late
when
she
and
mom
beck
came
again
the
sunset
glow
had
almost
faded
from
the
sky
they
bolted
the
front
door
and
went
out
the
back
mom
beck
taking
the
key
again
ida
is
waiting
for
me
on
the
front
lloyd
explained
mom
beck
i
mighty
homesick
to
come
back
to
you
all
honey
responded
the
faithful
old
soul
i
going
to
bring
you
some
prawlines
in
the
mawnin
ole
becky
knows
what
cheer
up
her
baby
lloyd
paused
at
the
corner
of
the
porch
i
think
we
ought
to
go
now
she
called
in
a
minute
answered
ida
i
catch
up
with
you
lloyd
walked
on
slowly
by
herself
down
the
avenue
through
the
gate
beside
the
railroad
track
she
was
in
sight
of
the
depot
before
ned
bannon
struck
off
across
a
field
and
ida
joined
her
she
did
not
speak
as
they
hurried
on
toward
the
seminary
and
lloyd
felt
with
a
desolate
sinking
of
the
heart
that
the
old
intimacy
could
never
be
resumed
chapter
xii
ghost
or
girl
allison
struggling
into
her
jacket
as
she
ran
hurried
along
the
path
through
clovercroft
to
overtake
kitty
and
katie
on
their
way
home
at
noon
wait
she
called
waving
her
gloves
frantically
to
attract
their
attention
as
they
looked
back
from
the
woodland
gate
i
have
some
news
for
you
she
was
almost
breathless
when
she
caught
up
with
them
what
do
you
think
of
this
ida
and
lloyd
have
had
a
falling
out
of
some
kind
neither
one
will
say
what
it
about
but
they
do
have
anything
more
to
do
with
each
other
and
ida
has
resigned
from
the
shadow
club
she
told
me
just
now
to
tell
you
all
that
she
could
come
any
more
and
that
we
might
as
well
invite
somebody
else
to
join
in
her
place
she
did
give
any
reason
for
leaving
and
you
know
when
she
puts
on
that
dignified
air
of
hers
one
does
feel
at
liberty
to
ask
questions
i
told
her
i
was
sorry
and
started
to
beg
her
to
change
her
mind
but
she
would
listen
just
smiled
in
a
mournful
sort
of
way
as
if
she
had
lost
her
last
friend
and
hurried
past
me
i
asked
betty
if
she
knew
what
was
the
matter
and
she
said
it
must
be
a
quarrel
of
some
kind
for
lloyd
was
dreadfully
unhappy
after
she
came
back
from
locust
yesterday
evening
she
threw
herself
across
the
bed
and
cried
and
cried
and
would
tell
what
for
she
would
go
down
to
supper
either
and
afterward
when
betty
fixed
her
something
on
the
she
barely
tasted
it
we
have
a
gay
old
club
meeting
said
katie
with
ida
gone
and
lloyd
in
the
dumps
and
betty
unable
to
come
on
account
of
her
cold
and
her
head
so
full
of
the
book
she
writing
that
she
ca
take
any
interest
in
anything
else
interrupted
kitty
it
too
bad
that
there
only
half
a
club
left
three
of
us
ca
get
enough
things
ready
to
have
a
fair
by
easter
that
is
the
worst
of
it
answered
katie
the
three
of
us
alone
never
can
get
even
with
mittie
dupong
and
carry
out
our
hoodoo
plot
to
punish
her
because
we
are
all
outside
of
the
seminary
i
tired
of
having
the
girls
laugh
whenever
they
see
me
eating
an
apple
and
make
remarks
about
and
i
tired
of
hearing
everlastingly
about
that
old
valentine
chimed
in
kitty
if
the
other
girls
wo
help
us
i
think
we
ought
to
act
on
ida
suggestion
and
take
in
some
new
members
who
would
lucy
smith
would
be
glad
to
join
in
ida
place
said
allison
she
rooms
across
the
hall
from
mittie
and
she
dare
do
anything
that
we
would
suggest
and
retta
long
room
is
just
above
and
she
a
good
friend
of
ours
added
kitty
let
talk
it
over
with
betty
and
lloyd
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
the
seminary
after
dinner
and
if
they
willing
we
swear
in
the
new
members
at
recess
all
right
assented
katie
i
hurry
back
and
meet
you
here
at
the
depot
as
soon
as
i
get
through
dinner
we
settle
this
before
night
but
much
running
back
and
forth
and
consulting
and
discussing
was
necessary
before
the
new
addition
to
the
club
was
in
full
working
order
lloyd
and
betty
were
willing
to
admit
retta
and
lucy
but
retta
and
lucy
were
not
willing
to
join
unless
their
roommates
were
included
in
the
invitation
and
their
roommates
dora
deersly
and
rose
parker
were
not
willing
to
spend
any
time
in
making
fancy
articles
for
the
fair
it
was
too
near
the
holidays
they
said
they
needed
all
their
spare
time
for
the
presents
they
were
trying
to
finish
before
christmas
could
they
be
sort
of
honorary
members
and
not
have
to
work
suggested
kitty
they
need
even
meet
with
us
on
saturdays
if
they
help
us
play
ghost
to
scare
mittie
yes
there
are
some
secret
societies
like
the
masons
that
have
different
orders
allison
said
why
could
we
have
too
we
be
one
kind
of
shadow
the
kind
that
casts
the
influence
and
the
other
four
can
be
another
kind
and
do
the
mischief
we
can
call
ourselves
the
for
good
ghosts
betty
ca
you
fix
up
something
for
the
others
yes
answered
betty
if
you
give
me
enough
time
she
turned
to
the
little
she
always
carried
and
began
looking
over
a
list
of
words
on
the
last
page
the
girls
often
laughed
at
betty
devotion
to
the
dictionary
frequently
they
found
her
poring
over
its
pages
picking
out
new
words
that
pleased
her
fancy
as
they
would
pick
out
the
kernels
of
a
nut
and
jotting
them
down
for
future
use
here
it
is
she
cried
presently
wraith
it
means
spirit
or
apparition
they
can
be
the
wicked
wraiths
the
no
she
added
as
another
chosen
word
caught
her
eye
they
can
be
the
wraiths
of
vengeance
that
sounds
better
that
will
fit
in
with
the
story
of
the
veiled
lady
who
haunts
the
seminary
because
it
is
supposed
she
comes
back
to
try
to
wreak
vengeance
on
the
people
who
wronged
her
allison
you
tell
little
elise
that
story
and
let
her
spread
it
among
the
primary
grades
and
it
be
all
over
the
school
by
the
time
the
girls
are
ready
to
perform
that
the
wraith
of
vengeance
has
been
seen
again
floating
near
mittie
dupong
door
there
was
no
regular
meeting
of
the
shadow
club
that
saturday
walton
had
not
been
taken
into
the
secret
of
the
wraiths
of
vengeance
and
when
it
was
explained
to
her
that
betty
had
a
cold
and
could
not
come
and
lloyd
and
ida
had
had
a
misunderstanding
and
were
not
on
good
terms
she
was
quite
willing
to
compensate
the
girls
for
their
disappointment
by
inviting
lucy
smith
and
retta
long
to
tea
some
of
the
neighbours
came
in
to
spend
the
evening
so
allison
and
kitty
took
their
guests
to
make
some
experiments
with
a
magic
lantern
which
had
often
afforded
them
amusement
little
elise
who
had
seen
all
the
pictures
many
times
before
went
back
to
the
library
and
barbry
soon
finished
her
evening
duties
so
no
one
ever
knew
just
what
those
experiments
were
among
the
slides
was
a
picture
of
lot
wife
a
tall
white
figure
with
a
veil
turning
for
a
backward
look
the
lurid
flames
of
burning
sodom
glowed
in
the
background
the
first
time
lucy
and
retta
saw
it
thrown
upon
the
wall
but
the
last
time
it
was
changed
into
a
ghostly
figure
that
made
those
wraiths
of
vengeance
dance
for
joy
allison
with
a
thick
coat
of
black
paint
had
carefully
covered
all
the
background
blotting
out
everything
in
the
circle
except
the
figure
itself
which
stood
out
with
startling
distinctness
then
from
the
top
of
a
they
practised
throwing
it
from
the
transom
of
room
through
the
opposite
transom
of
the
room
across
the
hall
it
will
be
even
easier
than
this
at
the
seminary
said
lucy
for
the
hall
between
mittie
room
and
mine
is
narrower
and
the
transoms
are
lower
that
will
throw
the
figure
directly
above
the
foot
of
bed
i
think
it
will
be
all
the
better
that
we
have
to
throw
it
high
for
it
will
give
the
floating
effect
the
veiled
lady
is
famous
for
to
have
the
head
so
near
the
ceiling
i
have
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
provisions
so
that
i
need
not
go
down
to
supper
monday
night
then
while
everybody
is
in
the
i
hide
the
under
my
bed
and
experiment
with
the
lantern
from
my
transom
to
get
exactly
the
right
position
what
if
mittie
should
wake
up
when
you
flash
it
in
suggested
allison
retta
was
equal
to
providing
for
such
an
emergency
i
set
my
watch
with
lucy
she
said
and
at
exactly
the
moment
we
agree
upon
tap
on
mittie
window
just
below
mine
with
a
bottle
let
down
on
a
string
i
give
three
sepulchral
knocks
then
wait
a
minute
and
give
three
more
i
should
think
that
an
empty
bottle
knocking
against
the
glass
would
give
a
hollow
sort
of
sound
that
the
window
we
always
keep
open
at
night
when
it
time
for
barbry
to
take
you
home
said
allison
we
go
too
and
help
carry
the
lantern
now
this
is
a
case
of
our
being
where
we
can
not
we
ca
do
the
actual
scaring
but
it
our
lantern
that
going
to
cast
the
shadow
that
will
make
mittie
dupong
afraid
to
listen
again
as
long
as
she
lives
it
took
considerable
on
lucy
part
to
forego
supper
when
the
time
came
to
carry
out
the
plan
but
the
spirit
of
mischief
was
stronger
than
her
appetite
she
was
rewarded
by
finding
the
daintiest
of
luncheons
in
the
box
allison
left
upon
her
table
and
as
she
sat
down
to
enjoy
it
after
bringing
in
the
from
the
and
making
her
experiments
she
thought
the
order
of
wraiths
was
a
most
excellent
thing
to
which
to
belong
although
midnight
is
the
prescribed
time
for
all
ghostly
visitants
these
wraiths
had
arranged
for
a
much
earlier
appearing
it
would
cost
too
great
an
effort
to
keep
awake
until
that
witching
hour
it
was
not
more
than
ten
although
the
seminary
had
been
in
darkness
and
silence
for
an
hour
when
retta
leaned
out
of
her
window
dangling
an
empty
bottle
on
the
end
of
a
long
string
it
swung
against
mittie
window
just
below
with
three
hollow
knocks
ten
seconds
after
by
lucy
watch
the
knocking
was
repeated
she
could
not
hear
it
from
her
room
but
her
faith
in
retta
punctuality
in
carrying
out
her
part
of
the
programme
made
her
send
a
dazzling
circle
of
light
from
the
lantern
she
was
manipulating
to
rest
on
the
wall
above
the
foot
of
mittie
bed
mittie
sat
up
in
bed
too
startled
to
utter
a
sound
the
light
instantly
disappeared
and
a
figure
took
its
place
to
her
horror
she
could
distinctly
see
the
dark
through
its
ghostly
outlines
she
buried
her
face
in
the
bedclothes
with
a
moan
of
terror
illustration
mittie
sat
up
in
bed
too
startled
to
utter
a
sound
what
the
matter
mittie
asked
her
roommate
from
the
opposite
bed
who
had
been
aroused
by
the
knocking
and
the
light
but
had
not
opened
her
eyes
until
she
heard
the
moan
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
gave
mittie
courage
to
look
out
again
the
apparition
was
gone
oh
she
quavered
i
must
have
been
dreaming
i
thought
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
window
then
there
was
a
blinding
light
and
the
next
instant
the
veiled
lady
seemed
to
float
across
the
room
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
i
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
my
tongue
is
stiff
yet
and
i
am
all
in
a
shiver
oh
it
was
awful
it
must
have
been
the
potato
salad
you
ate
for
supper
answered
sara
drowsily
but
as
she
spoke
the
three
slow
knocks
sounded
again
at
the
window
and
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
to
listen
there
it
is
again
wailed
mittie
burrowing
under
the
bedclothes
again
the
hair
fairly
rose
on
sara
head
as
the
outlines
of
a
veiled
figure
appeared
above
the
foot
of
mittie
bed
floating
hesitatingly
a
little
space
and
then
vanished
in
a
flash
sara
had
disappeared
from
view
also
and
lay
almost
smothered
under
the
blankets
so
rigid
with
fear
that
she
dared
not
move
a
muscle
she
held
herself
motionless
until
she
began
to
ache
it
seemed
hours
before
either
one
dared
look
out
again
although
it
was
barely
five
minutes
it
was
the
hoodoo
beginning
to
work
gasped
sara
in
a
hoarse
whisper
oh
if
i
ever
live
through
this
night
i
tell
you
i
get
out
of
this
room
in
the
morning
mittie
dupong
i
never
spend
another
night
with
a
girl
that
marked
for
the
haunts
to
follow
it
was
hours
before
they
fell
asleep
for
they
kept
opening
their
eyes
to
assure
themselves
that
the
apparition
had
not
reappeared
even
in
broad
daylight
the
memory
of
their
fright
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
about
it
required
all
the
persuasion
that
mittie
could
bring
to
bear
and
the
gift
of
a
coral
to
prevail
upon
sara
not
to
go
to
the
teachers
with
the
matter
she
finally
consented
to
room
with
mittie
one
more
night
but
announced
in
case
the
ghost
came
back
certainly
alarm
the
seminary
but
if
the
teachers
found
out
that
i
really
was
marked
that
way
sobbed
mittie
they
go
to
investigating
and
find
out
about
my
eavesdropping
and
they
would
let
me
stay
in
the
school
if
the
spirits
made
such
a
disturbance
about
it
sara
promised
secrecy
but
while
no
hint
of
the
appearance
reached
the
faculty
every
girl
in
the
seminary
heard
of
it
before
night
nothing
was
talked
of
but
and
and
appearances
no
ghostly
visitant
disturbed
mittie
and
sara
slumbers
the
second
night
the
shadow
club
in
secret
session
decided
it
would
not
be
safe
to
venture
again
so
soon
but
a
spirit
of
unrest
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
seminary
mischievous
girls
knocked
on
the
walls
to
see
their
roommates
turn
pale
cold
hands
reached
suddenly
out
of
dark
corners
to
clutch
unwary
and
a
panic
spread
in
a
single
evening
among
the
pupils
more
contagious
than
mumps
or
measles
every
one
not
infected
with
the
fear
seemed
infected
with
a
desire
to
make
some
one
else
afraid
even
gentle
little
jean
wilson
whose
deportment
was
always
perfect
and
who
was
too
to
watch
a
spider
killed
so
the
girls
declared
felt
moved
to
do
something
her
roommate
ada
day
loudly
proclaimed
that
was
not
afraid
of
spooks
and
she
did
have
any
patience
with
girls
who
were
silly
enough
to
believe
such
tales
nothing
could
frighten
while
ada
was
in
the
that
evening
jean
emptied
a
tin
box
of
talcum
powder
slipped
a
spool
of
thread
inside
and
drawing
the
end
of
the
thread
through
one
of
the
holes
in
the
perforated
lid
hid
the
box
in
the
springs
of
ada
bed
the
black
thread
trailing
across
the
carpet
to
jean
pillow
was
not
visible
in
the
dimly
lighted
room
when
ada
came
back
and
found
jean
lying
with
her
eyes
closed
she
did
not
turn
up
the
lamp
but
began
undressing
as
quietly
as
possible
and
was
soon
in
bed
herself
both
girls
were
wakeful
that
night
both
heard
the
clock
strike
several
times
ada
tossed
and
turned
whenever
she
roused
but
jean
lay
as
quiet
as
possible
breathing
regularly
so
that
ada
thought
she
was
asleep
and
did
not
venture
to
speak
as
the
clock
in
the
lower
hall
stopped
striking
twelve
jean
reached
for
the
thread
fastened
to
her
pillow
by
a
pin
and
gave
it
several
quick
uneven
jerks
the
spool
rattling
in
the
tin
box
sounded
like
the
mysterious
rappings
at
which
ada
had
turned
up
her
nose
to
hear
it
thus
in
the
dead
of
night
was
a
different
matter
to
ada
jean
she
called
in
a
hoarse
jean
did
you
hear
that
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
jean
gave
the
thread
another
tweak
and
then
answered
in
the
same
loud
whisper
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
something
was
trying
to
spell
your
name
by
tapping
it
comes
from
under
your
bed
but
then
of
course
you
believe
in
such
things
it
may
be
a
warning
i
wish
i
dared
put
my
foot
out
of
bed
said
ada
her
teeth
chattering
i
get
up
and
make
a
light
you
do
it
jean
i
do
that
much
for
you
if
the
noise
was
under
your
bed
sh
warned
jean
i
believe
something
is
really
calling
you
certainly
spelling
your
name
now
count
one
knock
that
is
a
one
two
three
four
one
again
a
yes
that
spelled
ada
now
it
beginning
again
one
two
three
four
d
one
a
the
knocks
followed
in
rapid
succession
until
ada
realizing
that
they
were
going
all
the
way
to
y
was
almost
paralyzed
with
terror
oh
jean
she
wailed
stop
it
stop
it
get
up
and
make
a
light
or
call
the
matron
or
something
i
ca
stand
it
a
minute
longer
i
be
a
gibbering
idiot
if
you
do
stop
that
awful
knocking
jean
still
continued
to
jerk
the
thread
till
she
heard
ada
spring
up
desperately
as
if
to
jump
out
of
bed
then
she
said
oh
do
be
still
ada
day
it
nothing
but
a
spool
in
a
tin
box
see
i
strike
a
match
and
show
you
i
was
only
playing
a
trick
on
you
because
you
boasted
nothing
could
frighten
you
do
rouse
the
house
for
mercy
sake
it
took
much
time
and
much
pleading
on
jean
part
to
convince
ada
that
there
was
really
no
spirit
under
her
bed
and
then
it
took
more
time
and
pleading
to
appease
her
anger
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
striking
of
a
match
aroused
the
matron
she
lay
for
a
moment
wondering
what
was
the
matter
then
thinking
that
some
one
might
be
ill
and
in
need
of
her
services
she
got
up
slipped
on
a
warm
bathrobe
and
her
felt
bedroom
slippers
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
to
investigate
all
was
quiet
but
she
had
a
feeling
that
some
mischief
was
afloat
an
inkling
of
the
disturbing
element
in
the
school
had
reached
her
early
in
the
day
and
although
she
had
said
nothing
to
the
teachers
she
had
made
a
careful
round
of
inspection
just
before
going
to
bed
some
rumour
of
the
doings
of
the
shadow
club
which
had
come
to
her
made
her
go
to
the
west
wing
and
push
aside
the
portière
hanging
over
the
door
that
led
to
the
outside
stairway
the
bolt
was
in
place
but
it
slipped
easily
in
its
sheath
as
if
it
had
lately
been
oiled
selecting
a
key
on
the
ring
at
her
belt
she
locked
the
door
i
risk
a
fire
for
one
night
she
thought
but
i
ca
risk
some
other
things
although
the
hall
was
quiet
when
she
stepped
out
now
in
the
midnight
silence
some
feeling
that
all
was
not
right
made
her
slip
on
down
the
front
stairs
there
was
no
light
excepting
a
faint
starlight
that
served
to
show
where
the
windows
were
as
she
stood
there
listening
about
to
strike
a
match
something
in
white
brushed
down
the
stairs
past
her
half
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
thinking
to
pay
the
girl
or
ghost
whichever
it
was
back
in
her
own
coin
the
matron
threw
her
arms
around
the
sheeted
figure
there
was
a
muffled
scream
of
terror
but
holding
her
captive
fast
with
one
strong
hand
the
matron
struck
a
match
with
the
other
hush
she
said
there
no
use
in
disturbing
everybody
then
as
the
match
flared
up
she
saw
that
it
was
no
wraith
of
vengeance
she
held
the
sheet
fell
to
the
floor
revealing
ida
shane
dressed
even
to
hat
and
furs
and
carrying
her
leather
chapter
xiii
the
shadow
club
in
disgrace
the
president
wishes
to
see
the
members
of
the
shadow
club
in
his
office
immediately
they
will
please
pass
out
before
we
proceed
with
the
opening
exercises
that
was
the
announcement
professor
fowler
made
in
chapel
next
morning
and
a
clap
of
thunder
from
a
clear
sky
could
not
have
been
more
unexpected
or
more
startling
in
its
effect
a
frightened
silence
pervaded
the
room
so
deep
that
every
girl
could
hear
her
heart
beat
a
message
to
doctor
wells
office
at
that
hour
was
almost
unheard
of
he
always
conducted
the
chapel
exercises
himself
it
must
be
a
matter
of
grave
importance
indeed
that
would
cause
his
absence
now
and
the
sending
of
such
a
message
lloyd
and
betty
exchanged
startled
glances
then
slowly
rose
followed
by
allison
and
kitty
katie
stood
up
next
and
looked
back
with
a
giggle
at
lucy
retta
rose
and
dora
who
being
only
of
the
order
of
hesitated
to
follow
but
emphatic
beckonings
brought
them
to
their
feet
and
they
filed
out
into
the
hall
after
the
other
girls
their
heads
held
high
and
smiling
as
if
indifferent
to
the
whisperings
around
them
but
the
instant
the
door
closed
upon
them
and
they
found
themselves
alone
in
the
hall
outside
they
began
demanding
of
each
other
the
reason
for
the
summons
you
need
ask
exclaimed
lucy
we
did
do
a
thing
last
night
on
our
side
of
the
building
i
no
more
idea
than
a
chipmunk
why
we
were
sent
for
nothing
happened
in
our
wing
protested
betty
and
lloyd
in
the
same
breath
oh
girls
i
all
in
a
shake
exclaimed
retta
long
almost
in
tears
it
frightens
me
nearly
to
death
to
think
of
being
called
up
before
the
president
such
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
before
nor
to
any
of
our
family
oh
boo
exclaimed
kitty
with
a
reassuring
smile
we
have
done
anything
so
killing
bad
that
we
need
care
we
only
had
a
little
fun
come
on
i
not
afraid
of
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
men
but
in
spite
of
her
brave
words
she
sat
down
as
shyly
as
the
rest
of
them
when
doctor
wells
tall
and
commanding
motioned
them
to
seats
in
front
of
his
desk
he
looked
so
big
and
dignified
standing
before
them
erect
and
silent
while
he
waited
for
them
to
be
seated
that
her
courage
failed
her
but
when
he
sat
down
in
his
armchair
and
looked
gravely
from
one
frightened
face
to
the
other
kitty
saw
a
twinkle
in
the
kind
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
which
reassured
her
we
caught
a
ghost
in
the
seminary
last
night
young
ladies
he
began
abruptly
with
a
smile
twitching
an
instant
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
it
was
only
for
an
instant
his
face
was
unusually
grave
as
he
proceeded
it
was
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
very
serious
occurrence
which
would
have
been
a
great
calamity
to
the
school
it
made
a
partial
confession
which
implicated
some
one
in
your
club
and
i
have
sent
for
you
in
order
that
you
may
clear
yourselves
at
once
most
of
your
mischief
has
been
only
innocent
amusement
i
know
but
i
must
have
a
complete
history
of
the
club
from
the
beginning
six
weeks
ago
up
till
twelve
last
night
at
mention
of
a
ghost
they
looked
at
each
other
with
startled
faces
wondering
how
much
he
already
knew
evidently
some
one
outside
of
the
club
had
been
playing
their
own
game
and
they
wondered
who
could
have
made
a
confession
which
could
truthfully
have
included
them
instinctively
they
turned
to
betty
to
be
their
spokesman
with
her
truthful
brown
eyes
looking
straight
into
the
doctor
betty
clasped
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
gave
a
simple
account
of
the
club
she
began
with
the
verse
miss
edith
had
written
in
their
albums
and
the
story
she
had
told
them
of
the
girls
who
walked
forty
miles
to
the
mountain
school
she
told
of
the
impulse
it
had
awakened
in
them
to
do
something
for
the
mountain
people
and
the
club
that
had
grown
out
of
that
desire
we
did
intend
to
play
any
pranks
in
the
beginning
she
said
all
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
cast
our
where
we
could
never
be
but
just
after
we
met
in
our
room
one
saturday
afternoon
and
a
girl
hid
in
the
closet
next
to
ours
and
heard
all
our
secrets
and
went
and
told
them
and
we
decided
to
shadow
awhile
to
punish
her
for
being
so
mean
but
of
the
club
lived
outside
the
seminary
and
ida
shane
resigned
about
that
time
so
we
established
a
new
order
and
took
these
four
girls
in
as
wraiths
of
vengeance
she
nodded
toward
the
new
members
a
grim
smile
flitted
across
the
doctor
face
as
he
listened
to
her
explanation
of
their
duties
and
heard
the
use
they
had
made
of
wife
and
the
magic
lantern
but
he
smoothed
his
white
moustache
to
cover
his
amusement
and
when
she
finished
he
sat
in
deep
thought
a
moment
his
brows
drawn
closely
together
if
there
was
any
ghost
around
last
night
we
were
responsible
for
its
doings
she
added
it
did
belong
to
the
club
why
did
ida
shane
resign
he
asked
suddenly
i
do
know
sir
answered
betty
she
would
tell
there
must
have
been
a
reason
he
continued
sternly
do
you
know
kitty
no
sir
do
you
katie
no
sir
the
same
question
and
the
same
answer
passed
down
the
line
until
it
came
to
lloyd
she
blushed
a
vivid
scarlet
and
hesitated
yes
i
know
she
exclaimed
but
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
the
president
held
out
part
of
a
torn
envelope
on
which
was
written
with
many
flourishes
in
a
bold
masculine
hand
lloydsboro
seminary
kindness
of
bearer
have
any
of
you
seen
this
handwriting
before
he
asked
the
envelope
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
each
girl
shaking
her
head
in
denial
until
it
came
to
lloyd
with
a
sick
sinking
of
heart
she
recognized
the
familiar
penmanship
that
had
been
such
a
bugbear
and
which
she
had
hoped
never
to
see
again
all
the
colour
faded
from
her
face
as
she
faintly
acknowledged
that
it
was
familiar
that
is
all
he
said
carelessly
tossing
the
paper
back
on
the
desk
i
am
glad
to
find
that
the
club
as
a
club
is
in
no
way
accountable
for
the
affair
that
i
mentioned
i
shall
have
to
forbid
any
more
games
of
ghost
however
and
must
ask
the
owners
of
the
magic
lantern
to
take
their
property
home
he
kept
them
a
moment
longer
with
a
few
earnest
words
which
they
never
could
forget
they
were
so
fatherly
so
helpful
and
inspiring
they
went
away
with
a
higher
value
of
the
motive
of
their
little
club
and
its
power
to
influence
others
and
an
earnest
purpose
to
measure
up
to
the
high
standard
he
set
for
them
made
them
quiet
and
thoughtful
all
that
morning
just
a
moment
please
lloyd
he
said
as
she
was
about
to
pass
out
with
the
others
there
another
matter
about
which
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
she
dropped
into
her
seat
again
when
the
last
girl
had
passed
out
closing
the
door
behind
her
he
picked
up
the
scrap
of
envelope
again
saying
i
must
ask
you
one
more
question
lloyd
have
you
seen
this
handwriting
before
she
looked
up
at
him
imploringly
oh
please
doctah
wells
she
begged
do
ask
me
i
not
at
liberty
to
tell
that
eithah
i
promised
that
i
would
on
my
honah
you
know
but
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
know
he
answered
sternly
you
are
here
in
my
charge
and
i
have
the
right
to
demand
an
answer
i
am
in
honah
bound
not
to
tell
she
repeated
a
trifle
defiantly
although
her
lips
quivered
it
would
get
some
one
else
into
trouble
and
i
have
to
refuse
even
if
you
expel
me
for
it
the
doctor
and
the
old
colonel
had
been
friends
since
their
youth
and
he
recognized
the
lloyd
stubbornness
now
in
the
firmly
set
mouth
and
the
poise
of
the
head
my
dear
child
he
said
kindly
seeing
a
tear
begin
to
steal
from
under
her
long
lashes
it
is
for
your
own
sake
in
the
absence
of
your
parents
and
for
the
sake
of
the
school
reputation
that
i
am
obliged
to
make
these
inquiries
the
somebody
whom
you
are
trying
to
shield
is
already
in
trouble
and
your
telling
or
not
telling
can
make
no
difference
now
lloyd
looked
up
in
alarm
yes
it
was
ida
shane
whom
the
matron
discovered
trying
to
steal
out
of
the
seminary
last
night
ned
bannon
was
waiting
outside
to
take
her
on
the
fast
express
to
cincinnati
they
were
to
have
been
married
there
this
morning
at
his
cousin
had
they
not
been
interrupted
in
their
plans
lloyd
gave
a
gasp
and
the
tree
outside
the
window
seemed
to
be
going
round
and
round
we
have
telegraphed
for
her
aunt
she
will
be
here
this
afternoon
to
take
her
home
and
the
affair
will
be
ended
as
far
as
the
seminary
is
concerned
now
what
i
must
know
is
just
what
connection
have
you
had
with
it
ida
confessed
that
a
member
of
the
shadow
club
had
helped
her
carry
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
for
awhile
but
for
some
reason
suddenly
refused
to
be
the
bearer
of
their
letters
any
longer
it
was
for
that
reason
she
said
feeling
that
her
only
friend
had
failed
her
that
she
consented
to
the
elopement
which
happily
has
been
prevented
oh
doctah
wells
do
think
i
am
to
blame
for
it
cried
lloyd
wishing
that
the
ground
would
open
and
swallow
her
if
he
should
say
yes
it
was
so
hard
to
know
what
to
do
it
neahly
broke
my
heart
to
refuse
her
but
it
was
this
way
with
the
tears
running
down
her
face
she
poured
out
the
whole
story
from
the
beginning
of
her
devotion
to
ida
to
the
day
when
under
her
grandmother
portrait
she
fought
the
battle
between
her
love
for
her
friend
and
loyalty
to
the
family
honour
there
was
anybody
to
tell
me
she
sobbed
at
the
last
and
if
i
was
wrong
and
am
to
blame
for
ida
running
away
nobody
will
evah
trust
me
again
a
very
tender
smile
flashed
across
the
doctor
stern
face
and
the
eyes
gleamed
through
the
spectacles
with
a
kinder
light
than
she
had
ever
seen
in
them
as
he
leaned
forward
to
say
i
have
known
george
lloyd
many
many
years
my
child
and
i
want
to
say
that
he
has
never
had
more
reason
to
be
proud
of
anything
in
his
life
than
that
his
little
granddaughter
under
such
a
test
recognized
the
right
and
stood
true
to
the
traditions
of
an
old
and
honourable
family
when
it
cost
her
a
friendship
that
she
held
very
dear
just
now
ida
feels
that
she
has
been
cruelly
used
and
that
her
happiness
is
wrecked
for
life
but
in
time
she
will
see
differently
poor
mistaken
child
i
talked
with
her
this
morning
ned
is
only
a
selfish
overgrown
boy
with
many
bad
habits
and
like
many
another
of
his
kind
knows
that
the
plea
that
she
is
reforming
him
is
the
strongest
argument
he
can
use
in
influencing
her
he
tells
her
she
is
doing
that
but
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
has
not
given
up
a
single
vice
since
he
has
known
her
she
thinks
that
it
is
her
duty
to
cling
to
him
i
admire
her
devotion
in
one
way
but
it
makes
her
blind
to
every
other
duty
she
is
too
infatuated
to
be
able
to
judge
between
the
right
and
wrong
and
at
present
feels
bitter
toward
the
whole
world
but
by
and
by
when
she
grows
wiser
and
learns
that
the
judgment
of
a
girl
in
such
matters
can
not
safely
be
trusted
she
will
be
glad
that
you
helped
bring
the
affair
to
a
crisis
when
she
has
outgrown
her
infatuation
she
will
see
that
you
have
done
her
a
kindness
instead
of
a
wrong
and
she
will
thank
you
deeply
lloyd
had
not
felt
so
for
days
as
when
she
left
the
president
office
both
on
her
own
account
and
ida
when
she
went
into
the
it
was
with
such
a
bright
face
that
every
one
felt
the
message
to
the
shadow
club
must
have
been
some
mark
of
especial
honour
when
doctor
wells
thought
the
affair
ended
as
far
as
the
seminary
was
concerned
he
had
not
taken
the
newspapers
into
account
no
one
could
guess
where
they
got
their
information
friday
morning
a
louisville
paper
came
out
to
the
valley
with
startling
headlines
schoolgirl
at
lloydsboro
valley
attempts
to
elope
with
son
of
prominent
judge
granddaughter
of
kentucky
colonel
plays
important
part
shadow
club
in
disgrace
ghosts
and
lovers
good
behaviour
and
learning
no
names
were
mentioned
but
the
badly
garbled
account
made
a
buzz
of
wonder
and
criticism
in
the
valley
doctor
wells
came
into
chapel
looking
worried
and
haggard
he
simply
stated
the
facts
of
the
case
and
held
up
the
paper
with
the
false
account
speaking
of
the
effect
such
a
report
would
have
on
the
school
it
puts
us
in
a
bad
light
he
said
the
public
will
say
we
should
have
been
more
watchful
this
will
be
copied
all
over
the
state
before
the
week
is
out
one
girl
has
already
been
ordered
home
by
telegraph
on
account
of
it
lloyd
did
not
see
the
paper
until
noon
she
read
it
hastily
standing
in
the
hall
and
then
ran
up
to
her
room
to
throw
herself
across
her
bed
in
a
violent
spell
of
crying
oh
how
could
they
tell
such
dreadful
stories
she
sobbed
to
betty
they
might
as
well
have
published
my
name
in
big
red
lettahs
as
to
have
described
locust
and
grandfathah
so
plainly
that
every
one
will
know
who
is
meant
he
and
mothah
will
be
so
mawtified
i
nevah
want
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
again
aftah
having
such
lies
copied
all
ovah
the
state
about
me
as
doctah
wells
says
they
will
be
i
ca
follow
them
up
and
prove
to
everybody
that
they
are
not
true
and
it
such
an
awful
disgrace
to
be
talked
about
that
way
in
the
papahs
if
grandfathah
or
papa
jack
were
home
i
believe
they
shoot
that
horrid
editah
the
matron
came
in
and
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
would
not
listen
she
was
in
a
nervous
state
when
trifles
were
magnified
into
great
troubles
and
she
persisted
in
thinking
that
she
was
too
disgraced
by
the
false
report
to
ever
appear
in
public
again
betty
could
not
coax
her
down
to
dinner
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
had
cried
herself
into
a
throbbing
headache
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
exhausted
by
her
crying
she
fell
into
such
a
sound
sleep
that
she
did
not
hear
the
girls
go
tramping
out
for
their
daily
walk
betty
stole
in
and
looked
at
her
and
went
sorrowfully
out
again
magnolia
budine
passing
the
door
with
her
on
the
way
to
the
old
carryall
waiting
at
the
gate
stopped
a
moment
and
listened
it
was
an
exciting
tale
she
was
carrying
home
to
roney
this
friday
afternoon
she
was
glad
the
sobs
had
ceased
she
had
heard
them
at
noon
and
had
gone
around
with
the
cloud
of
trouble
resting
on
her
like
a
heavy
burden
it
was
nearly
dark
when
lloyd
awoke
some
one
was
tapping
at
the
door
before
she
could
find
her
voice
to
say
come
in
walton
was
standing
beside
her
it
was
as
if
a
burst
of
sunshine
had
suddenly
brightened
the
dull
november
twilight
lloyd
started
to
scramble
up
but
walton
insisted
on
her
lying
still
sitting
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
she
began
stroking
her
hot
forehead
with
soft
motherly
touches
i
had
a
conversation
with
doctor
wells
over
the
telephone
about
that
affair
in
the
paper
she
began
he
told
me
what
a
state
you
were
in
about
it
so
i
immediately
wrote
to
your
mother
a
full
explanation
and
sent
it
off
on
the
two
train
stamped
delivery
get
it
as
soon
as
the
paper
so
put
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
point
now
i
come
over
to
tell
you
something
i
found
out
about
you
the
other
day
you
do
even
know
it
yourself
you
be
surprised
and
glad
sure
it
quite
a
story
so
i
shall
have
to
begin
it
like
one
one
blustery
day
last
week
an
old
farmer
stopped
at
clovercroft
and
asked
to
see
miss
katherine
it
proved
to
be
magnolia
budine
father
he
had
been
there
once
before
with
a
crock
of
which
he
brought
as
a
sort
of
to
katherine
because
she
had
made
magnolia
so
happy
about
the
costume
and
the
picture
she
took
of
her
in
it
katherine
said
he
would
have
made
a
striking
picture
himself
as
he
stood
there
with
his
slouched
hat
pulled
over
his
ears
a
blue
woollen
muffler
wound
around
his
neck
and
an
enormous
bronze
turkey
gobbler
in
his
arms
he
would
go
in
at
first
but
finally
stepped
inside
out
of
the
wind
still
holding
the
turkey
in
his
arms
it
seems
that
there
is
a
man
living
on
his
place
who
used
to
be
an
old
neighbour
of
the
budines
when
they
lived
near
loretta
this
man
has
been
unable
to
work
for
some
time
and
is
occupying
the
cabin
free
of
rent
he
has
a
daughter
about
sixteen
who
is
very
she
is
magnolia
best
friend
and
the
child
was
afraid
that
roney
as
he
called
her
was
going
to
die
she
wanted
her
picture
above
all
things
and
anything
that
magnolia
wants
the
old
fellow
evidently
makes
an
effort
to
get
for
her
he
seems
completely
wrapped
up
in
her
so
there
he
stood
with
his
best
bronze
gobbler
in
his
arms
and
tears
in
his
eyes
wanting
to
know
of
katherine
if
it
would
be
a
sufficient
inducement
for
her
to
drive
over
with
him
and
take
the
sick
girl
picture
she
told
him
she
never
took
pictures
for
pay
and
said
she
would
be
glad
to
do
it
for
nothing
if
it
were
not
such
a
bleak
day
that
she
was
afraid
to
ride
so
far
in
the
cold
he
was
greatly
distressed
at
his
failure
to
persuade
her
to
go
for
he
was
afraid
that
roney
might
die
before
the
weather
changed
and
then
his
little
girl
would
be
so
grieved
that
she
would
never
get
over
it
katherine
was
so
touched
by
the
old
fellow
disappointment
that
she
relented
and
told
him
she
would
risk
the
cold
if
i
would
be
willing
to
go
with
her
they
came
by
for
me
and
i
went
oh
lloyd
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
that
poor
bare
room
where
roney
was
lying
it
was
clean
but
so
pitifully
bare
of
all
that
is
bright
and
comfortable
i
looked
around
and
saw
not
a
picture
except
an
unframed
chromo
tacked
over
the
mantel
till
my
eyes
happened
to
rest
on
the
old
wooden
clock
there
behind
its
glass
door
swinging
back
and
forth
on
the
pendulum
was
picture
the
princess
with
the
dove
lloyd
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
pictuah
she
cried
in
astonishment
how
did
it
get
there
that
is
what
i
could
help
asking
roney
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
face
light
up
as
she
looked
at
it
my
princess
walton
she
said
gave
it
to
me
you
do
know
how
she
has
helped
me
through
the
long
days
and
nights
of
course
i
ca
see
her
in
the
dark
but
every
time
the
clock
ticks
i
know
she
is
swinging
away
there
saying
for
love
will
find
a
way
i
found
that
roney
case
is
one
for
the
king
daughters
to
take
in
hand
she
has
a
small
annuity
left
her
by
her
mother
family
that
is
all
her
father
and
she
have
to
live
on
that
will
stop
at
her
death
and
it
is
her
one
anxiety
that
in
spite
of
all
her
pain
she
may
hang
on
to
life
in
order
that
her
father
may
be
provided
for
the
daughters
sent
for
a
specialist
to
come
out
and
examine
her
he
says
she
can
be
cured
so
next
week
we
are
to
move
her
into
louisville
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
you
never
saw
such
a
happy
face
as
hers
when
we
told
her
she
cried
almost
gave
up
last
week
the
pain
was
so
terrible
i
have
borne
it
if
i
had
watched
the
pendulum
and
every
time
it
ticked
said
i
stand
it
one
more
second
for
daddy
sake
and
one
more
and
one
more
i
spinning
the
golden
thread
like
the
princess
and
love
find
a
way
to
help
me
hang
on
a
little
longer
so
you
see
dear
said
walton
with
a
playful
pat
of
the
cheek
your
face
and
betty
song
brought
hope
and
strength
to
a
poor
suffering
little
soul
of
whom
you
never
heard
your
reached
a
long
long
way
when
it
brought
comfort
to
roney
and
helped
keep
her
brave
what
do
you
care
for
this
trifle
you
are
crying
about
the
whole
affair
will
blow
over
and
be
forgotten
in
a
short
time
get
up
and
go
to
counting
the
pendulum
with
roney
and
sing
like
the
real
princess

are

find
a
way
to
make
us
forget
the
unpleasant
things
and
remember
only
the
good
lloyd
sat
up
and
threw
both
her
arms
around
walton
neck
the
real
princess
she
said
softly
with
a
kiss

about
doing
good
all
the
time
like
a
real
king
daughtah

walton
gaily
as

slipped
off

bed

your
eyes
and
pack
your
satchel
i
am
going
to
take
you
and
betty
home
with

to
stay
until
monday
morning
chapter
xiv
the
three
weavers
no
better
cure
could
have
been
found
for
lloyd
dejection
than
her
visit
to
the
beeches
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
brood
over
her
troubles
while
allison
and
kitty
were
continually
saying
funny
things
and
rushing
her
from
one
interesting
game
to
another
after
a
good
night
sleep
the
events
of
the
previous
day
seemed
so
far
away
that
what
she
had
considered
such
a
disgrace
had
somehow
lost
its
sting
and
she
wondered
how
she
could
have
suffered
so
keenly
over
it
katie
mallard
came
over
soon
after
breakfast
and
they
spent
nearly
the
entire
day
outdoors
the
air
was
frosty
and
bracing
and
when
walton
saw
them
come
running
into
the
house
just
before
sundown
with
bright
eyes
and
red
cheeks
she
felt
well
pleased
with
the
success
of
her
plan
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
by
a
front
window
writing
letters
when
the
girls
came
rushing
up
the
stairs
into
the
adjoining
room
kitty
carried
a
basket
of
apples
and
allison
some
and
the
popper
and
presently
an
appetizing
odour
began
to
steal
in
as
the
white
grains
danced
over
the
open
fire
as
the
girls
hovered
hungrily
around
waiting
for
the
popping
to
cease
they
began
a
lively
discussion
which
caught
walton
attention
she
paused
pen
in
hand
at
the
mention
of
two
names
daisy
dale
and
the
heiress
of
dorn
they
were
familiar
names
for
only
the
day
before
miss
edith
had
showed
her
the
pile
of
books
found
in
ida
closet
and
she
was
waiting
for
a
suitable
time
to
speak
of
them
to
the
girls
as
she
folded
her
letter
and
addressed
it
she
decided
she
would
call
them
in
a
little
later
when
they
were
through
with
their
apples
and
their
corn
for
a
quiet
little
twilight
talk
a
golden
afterglow
gleamed
above
the
western
and
leaning
back
in
her
she
sat
watching
it
fade
out
so
absorbed
in
a
story
she
was
thinking
to
tell
them
that
she
ceased
to
hear
the
girlish
chatter
in
the
next
room
till
lloyd
voice
rang
out
clearly
i
made
up
my
mind
i
going
to
get
married
then
you
be
an
old
maid
was
kitty
teasing
rejoinder
and
people
will
poke
fun
at
you
and
your
cats
and
teacups
i
not
have
any
was
the
prompt
reply
i
nevah
expect
to
have
any
moah
pets
of
any
kind
whenevah
i
get
to
loving
anything
something
always
happens
to
it
think
of
all
the
pets
we
have
had
at
locust
fritz
and
the
two
bobs
and
boots
and
the
gobblah
and
the
goat
and
the
parrot
and
deah
old
hero
something
happened
to
every
one
of
them
the
ponies
are
the
only
things
left
and
the
only
kind
of
a
pet
i
evah
have
again
if
tarbaby
should
die
i
buy
me
a
hawse
for
i
expect
to
be
the
kind
of
an
old
maid
that
sits
in
a
with
a
tabby
and
a
teapot
i
expect
to
dash
around
the
country
on
hawseback
and
have
fun
even
when
i
old
and
wrinkled
and
gray
i
go
to
college
of
and
i
have
interesting
people
to
visit
me
so
that
i
keep
up
my
interest
in
the
world
and
not
get
cranky
i
come
and
live
with
you
said
allison
i
have
a
studio
and
devote
my
life
to
making
a
great
artist
of
myself
we
could
buy
tanglewood
and
make
a
moat
all
around
the
house
so
that
we
could
pull
up
the
drawbridge
when
we
wanted
to
be
alone
or
were
afraid
of
burglars
maybe
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
be
an
old
maid
too
said
betty
musingly
i
have
more
time
to
write
books
than
if
i
had
a
husband
and
a
family
to
look
after
and
besides
while
i
like
to
read
about
lovers
and
such
things
in
stories
it
would
make
me
feel
dreadfully
foolish
to
have
any
man
fall
on
his
knees
to
me
and
say
the
things
that
lord
rokeby
and
guy
said
to
daisy
dale
i
do
even
like
to
write
those
speeches
when
i
in
a
room
by
myself
i
tried
lots
of
times
and
i
about
decided
to
skip
that
part
in
my
story
i
put
some
stars
instead
and
begin
year
has
passed
and
gladys
and
eugene
etc
i
was
going
to
ask
mothah
how
papa
jack
did
it
said
lloyd
but
aftah
all
that
happened
somehow
i
rathah
not
say
anything
about
such
things
to
oldah
people
miss
mccannister
was
so
horrified
when
she
found
we
had
talked
such
foolishness
as
she
called
it
nevah
forget
the
way
she
screwed
up
her
lips
and
said
considahed
propah
when
i
was
a
child
for
little
girls
to
discuss
such
subjects
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
caught
doing
something
wicked
it
mawtified
me
dreadfully
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
nevah
get
to
be
fond
of
anybody
the
way
ida
was
for
fear
i
might
be
mistaken
in
them
as
she
was
everything
seems
to
be
a
warning
lately
said
betty
even
the
literature
lessons
this
week
if
the
of
had
left
her
weaving
to
look
out
of
the
window
when
sir
lancelot
rode
by
the
curse
would
have
come
upon
her
there
cried
allison
scrambling
to
her
feet
that
reminds
me
that
i
have
learned
the
verses
that
miss
edith
asked
us
to
memorize
for
monday
she
took
a
worn
copy
of
tennyson
from
the
table
and
began
rapidly
turning
the
leaves
i
learned
the
whole
thing
yesterday
said
betty
i
can
say
every
word
of
part
first
it
easy
remarked
kitty
i
know
part
of
it
although
i
not
in
the
class
i
learned
it
from
hearing
allison
read
it
gray
walls
and
four
gray
towers
overlook
a
space
of
flowers
and
the
silent
isle
embowers
the
lady
of
shalott
is
that
right
yes
but
that
is
monday
lesson
it
part
second
we
have
to
learn
let
all
learn
it
proposed
katie
it
so
pretty
and
jingles
along
so
easily
i
like
to
know
it
too
you
line
it
out
allison
as
frazer
does
the
hymns
at
the
coloured
baptizings
and
we
run
a
race
and
see
who
can
repeat
it
first
there
she
weaves
by
night
and
day
read
allison
and
then
the
five
voices
gabbled
it
all
together
there
she
weaves
by
night
and
day
the
concert
recitation
went
on
for
some
time
and
presently
the
lines
of
the
familiar
old
poem
began
weaving
themselves
into
the
story
walton
was
thinking
about
the
red
gold
of
the
afterglow
had
not
entirely
faded
from
the
sky
when
she
left
her
seat
by
the
window
and
went
into
the
next
room
the
five
girls
on
the
were
still
chanting
the
lesson
over
and
over
come
hear
us
say
it
mother
called
kitty
drawing
up
a
chair
for
her
betty
learned
it
first
allison
deposited
the
bowl
of
in
her
lap
and
passed
her
the
basket
of
apples
and
then
flourished
the
popper
like
a
baton
now
all
together
she
cried
and
the
five
voices
rang
out
like
one
there
she
weaves
by
night
and
day
a
magic
web
with
colours
gay
she
has
heard
a
whisper
say
a
curse
is
on
her
if
she
stay
to
look
down
to
camelot
she
knows
not
what
the
curse
may
be
and
so
she
weaveth
steadily
and
little
other
care
hath
she
the
lady
of
shalott
and
moving
through
a
mirror
clear
that
hangs
before
her
all
the
year
shadows
of
the
world
appear
there
she
sees
the
highway
near
winding
down
to
camelot
there
the
river
eddy
whirls
and
the
surly
village
churls
and
the
red
cloaks
of
pass
onward
from
shalott
sometimes
a
troop
of
damsels
glad
an
abbot
on
an
ambling
pad
sometimes
a
curly
shepherd
lad
or
page
in
crimson
clad
goes
by
to
camelot
and
sometimes
through
the
mirror
blue
the
knights
come
riding
two
by
two
she
hath
no
loyal
knight
and
true
the
lady
of
shalott
why
she
was
an
old
maid
was
she
said
katie
so
plaintively
as
they
finished
that
they
all
laughed
that
what
allison
and
betty
and
lloyd
are
going
to
be
mother
said
kitty
teasingly
lloyd
with
a
very
red
face
hastened
to
change
the
subject
she
snuggled
up
against
walton
knee
saying
as
she
looked
into
the
glowing
fire
this
is
the
best
time
of
the
day
when
the
wind
goes
in
the
chimney
and
it
cold
and
dark
outdoahs
and
cheerful
and
bright
inside
it
just
the
time
for
do
you
know
one
mrs
walton
of
course
she
does
kitty
answered
for
her
and
if
you
do
know
one
you
can
make
one
up
to
order
ca
you
mamsie
your
poem
suggested
a
story
answered
walton
and
with
one
hand
smoothing
lloyd
fair
head
as
it
rested
against
her
knee
and
the
other
stroking
kitty
dark
one
in
her
lap
she
began
once
upon
a
time
the
same
time
that
the
lady
of
shalott
wove
her
magic
web
and
near
the
four
gray
towers
from
which
she
watched
the
road
running
down
to
camelot
there
lived
three
weavers
their
houses
stood
side
by
side
and
such
had
been
their
equal
fortunes
that
whatever
happened
under
the
roof
of
one
had
always
happened
under
the
roofs
of
the
others
they
wove
the
same
patterns
in
their
looms
and
they
received
the
same
number
of
shillings
for
their
webs
they
sang
the
same
songs
told
the
same
tales
ate
the
same
kind
of
broth
from
the
same
kind
of
bowls
and
dressed
in
the
same
coarse
goods
of
hodden
gray
but
they
were
unlike
as
three
weavers
could
possibly
be
the
first
insisted
on
weaving
all
his
webs
a
certain
length
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
man
who
must
wear
the
mantle
each
web
was
supposed
to
be
just
long
enough
to
make
one
mantle
the
second
carelessly
wove
his
any
length
that
happened
to
be
convenient
and
stretched
or
cut
it
afterward
to
fit
whomsoever
would
take
it
but
the
third
with
great
painstaking
and
care
measured
first
the
man
and
then
the
web
by
the
inches
and
ells
of
his
carefully
notched
yardstick
now
to
each
weaver
was
born
a
daughter
all
on
the
same
day
and
they
named
them
hertha
huberta
and
hildegarde
on
the
night
after
the
christening
as
the
three
men
sat
smoking
their
pipes
on
the
same
stoop
the
father
of
hertha
said
not
think
me
puffed
up
with
unseemly
pride
good
neighbours
but
wonderful
fortune
hath
befallen
me
and
mine
this
day
clotho
the
good
fairy
of
all
the
weavers
was
present
at
my
hertha
christening
and
left
beside
her
cradle
a
gift
a
tiny
loom
that
from
beam
to
shuttle
is
of
purest
gold
and
she
whispered
to
me
in
passing
good
fortune
herthold
it
is
written
in
the
stars
that
a
royal
prince
shall
seek
to
wed
thy
child
but
herthold
news
caused
no
astonishment
to
his
neighbours
what
had
happened
under
the
roof
of
one
had
happened
under
the
roofs
of
all
and
the
same
good
fortune
was
written
in
the
stars
for
each
and
the
same
gift
had
been
left
by
each
child
cradle
so
the
three
friends
rejoiced
together
and
boasted
jestingly
among
themselves
of
the
three
sons
who
should
some
day
sit
down
at
their
tables
but
presently
hildgardmar
the
father
of
hildegarde
said
there
may
be
a
slip
twixt
cup
and
lip
mayhap
our
daughters
can
not
fulfil
the
required
condition
at
that
they
looked
grave
for
a
moment
for
clotho
had
added
in
passing
thing
is
necessary
she
must
weave
upon
this
loom
i
leave
a
royal
mantle
for
the
prince
wearing
it
must
be
ample
and
fair
to
look
upon
rich
cloth
of
gold
of
princely
size
and
texture
many
will
come
to
claim
it
but
if
it
is
woven
rightly
the
destined
prince
alone
can
wear
it
and
him
it
will
fit
in
all
faultlessness
as
the
feathers
fit
the
falcon
but
if
it
should
not
be
ample
and
fine
meet
for
royal
wearing
the
prince
will
not
deign
to
don
it
and
the
heart
shall
break
as
broke
the
shattered
mirror
of
the
lady
of
shalott
well
said
herthold
when
the
three
had
smoked
in
silence
a
little
space
guard
against
that
i
shall
hide
all
knowledge
of
the
magic
loom
from
my
daughter
until
she
be
grown
then
under
mine
own
eye
by
mine
own
measurements
that
i
always
use
shall
she
weave
the
goodly
garment
in
the
meantime
she
shall
learn
all
the
arts
which
become
a
princess
to
know
broidery
and
fair
needlework
and
songs
upon
a
lute
but
of
the
weaving
she
shall
know
naught
until
she
be
grown
that
i
am
determined
upon
is
sorry
work
her
childish
hands
would
make
of
it
if
left
to
throw
the
shuttle
at
a
maiden
fickle
fancy
but
hubert
shook
his
head
stew
about
a
trifle
he
exclaimed
on
such
a
tiny
loom
no
web
of
any
kind
can
well
be
woven
is
but
a
toy
that
clotho
left
the
child
to
play
with
and
she
shall
weave
her
dreams
and
fancies
on
it
at
her
own
sweet
will
i
shall
not
interfere
what
written
in
the
stars
is
written
and
naught
that
i
can
do
will
change
it
away
friend
hildgardmar
with
thy
forebodings
hildgardmar
said
nothing
in
reply
but
he
thought
much
he
followed
the
example
of
the
others
and
early
and
late
might
have
been
heard
the
pounding
of
the
three
looms
for
there
was
need
to
work
harder
than
ever
now
that
the
little
maidens
might
have
teachers
for
all
the
arts
becoming
a
princess
broidery
and
fair
needlework
and
songs
upon
the
lute
while
the
looms
pounded
in
the
dwellings
the
little
maidens
grew
apace
they
played
together
in
the
same
garden
and
learned
from
the
same
skilled
teachers
their
daily
lessons
and
in
their
fondness
for
each
other
were
as
three
sisters
one
day
huberta
said
to
the
others
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
a
beautiful
toy
that
clotho
left
me
at
my
christening
my
father
says
she
gave
one
to
each
of
us
and
that
it
is
written
in
the
stars
that
we
are
each
to
wed
a
prince
if
we
can
weave
for
him
an
ample
cloak
of
cloth
of
gold
already
i
have
begun
to
weave
mine
all
silently
for
fear
of
watchful
eyes
and
forbidding
voices
they
stole
into
an
inner
room
and
she
showed
them
the
loom
of
gold
but
now
no
longer
was
it
the
tiny
toy
that
had
been
left
beside
her
cradle
it
had
grown
with
her
growth
for
every
inch
that
had
been
added
to
her
stature
an
inch
had
been
added
to
the
loom
the
warp
was
gift
all
thread
of
gold
and
it
too
grew
with
the
maiden
growth
but
the
thread
the
shuttle
carried
was
of
her
own
spinning
rainbow
hued
and
from
the
airy
of
her
own
sweet
fancies
she
whispered
have
begun
the
mantle
for
my
wearing
seizing
the
shuttle
as
she
had
seen
her
father
do
so
many
times
she
crossed
the
golden
warp
with
the
of
a
rosy
hertha
and
hildegarde
looked
on
in
silent
envy
not
so
much
for
the
loom
as
for
the
mirror
which
hung
beside
it
wherein
as
in
the
lady
of
shalott
moved
the
shadows
of
the
world
the
same
pictures
that
flitted
across
hers
flitted
across
huberta
she
cried
again
pointing
to
the
mirror
curly
shepherd
lad
does
he
not
look
like
a
prince
as
he
strides
by
with
his
head
high
and
his
blue
eyes
smiling
upon
all
the
world
he
carries
his
crook
like
a
royal
sceptre
forsooth
well
you
may
believe
i
am
always
at
my
mirror
both
at
sunrise
and
sunset
to
see
him
pass
gaily
by
page
in
crimson
clad
is
more
to
my
liking
said
hertha
timidly
he
has
a
noble
mien
as
of
one
brought
up
in
palaces
i
wonder
why
my
father
has
never
said
aught
to
me
of
gift
i
too
should
be
at
my
weaving
for
i
am
as
old
as
thou
huberta
i
also
added
hildegarde
him
quoth
huberta
he
hath
forgot
so
when
hertha
reached
home
she
went
to
her
father
herthold
and
said
timidly
with
downcast
eyes
and
blushes
where
is
my
loom
like
huberta
i
too
would
be
weaving
as
it
is
written
in
the
stars
but
herthold
glowered
upon
her
grimly
told
thee
of
aught
that
is
written
in
the
stars
he
demanded
so
sternly
that
her
heart
quaked
within
her
me
never
again
must
thou
listen
to
such
idle
tales
when
thou
art
a
woman
grown
thou
mayst
come
to
me
and
i
may
talk
to
thee
then
of
webs
and
weaving
but
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
such
things
now
thou
a
silly
child
bah
i
am
ashamed
that
ever
a
daughter
of
mine
should
think
such
foolishness
hertha
shamed
and
abashed
stole
away
to
weep
that
she
had
incurred
her
father
scorn
but
next
day
when
they
played
in
the
garden
huberta
said
father
is
an
old
tyrant
to
forbid
thee
the
use
of
clotho
gift
he
can
not
love
thee
as
mine
does
me
or
he
would
not
deny
thee
such
a
pleasure
come
i
will
help
thee
to
find
it
so
hand
in
hand
they
stole
into
an
inner
room
by
a
door
that
herthold
thought
securely
bolted
and
there
stood
a
loom
like
huberta
and
over
it
a
mirror
in
which
the
same
shadows
of
the
world
were
repeated
in
passing
and
as
hertha
picked
up
the
shuttle
to
send
the
thread
of
a
rosy
through
the
warp
of
gold
the
page
in
crimson
clad
passed
down
the
street
outside
and
she
saw
his
image
in
the
mirror
like
a
prince
he
bears
himself
she
murmured
father
is
indeed
a
tyrant
to
deny
me
the
pleasure
of
looking
out
upon
the
world
and
weaving
sweet
fancies
about
it
henceforth
i
shall
not
obey
him
but
shall
daily
steal
away
in
here
to
weave
in
secret
what
he
will
not
allow
me
to
do
openly
at
the
same
time
hildegarde
stood
before
her
father
saying
timidly
it
true
my
father
what
huberta
says
is
written
in
the
stars
when
i
saw
huberta
loom
i
pushed
back
the
bolt
which
has
always
barred
the
door
leading
into
an
inner
room
from
mine
and
there
i
found
the
loom
of
gold
and
a
wonderful
mirror
i
fain
would
use
them
as
huberta
does
but
i
have
come
to
ask
thee
first
if
all
be
well
a
very
tender
smile
lighted
the
face
of
old
hildgardmar
taking
the
hand
of
the
little
hildegarde
in
his
he
led
the
way
into
the
inner
room
have
often
looked
forward
to
this
day
my
little
one
he
exclaimed
i
did
not
think
thou
wouldst
come
quite
so
soon
with
thy
questions
it
is
indeed
true
what
huberta
hast
told
thee
is
written
in
the
stars
on
the
right
weaving
of
this
web
depends
the
happiness
of
all
thy
future
and
not
only
thine
but
of
those
who
may
come
after
thee
a
dangerous
gift
the
good
clotho
left
thee
for
looking
in
that
mirror
thou
wilt
be
tempted
to
weave
thy
web
to
fit
the
shifting
figures
that
flit
therein
but
listen
to
thy
father
who
hath
never
yet
deceived
thee
and
who
has
only
thy
good
at
heart
keep
always
by
thy
side
this
sterling
yardstick
which
i
give
thee
for
it
marks
the
inches
and
the
ells
to
which
the
stature
of
a
prince
must
measure
not
until
the
web
doth
fully
equal
it
can
it
be
safely
taken
from
the
loom
art
so
young
is
but
a
little
mantle
thou
couldst
weave
this
year
at
best
fit
but
to
clothe
the
shoulders
of
yon
curly
shepherd
lad
he
pointed
to
the
bright
reflection
passing
in
the
mirror
a
magic
loom
that
lengthens
with
thy
growth
and
each
year
shall
the
web
grow
longer
until
at
last
a
woman
grown
thou
canst
hold
it
up
against
the
yardstick
and
find
that
it
doth
measure
to
the
last
inch
and
ell
the
size
demanded
by
a
prince
noble
stature
thou
wilt
oft
be
dazzled
by
the
mirror
sights
and
youths
will
come
to
thee
one
by
one
each
begging
give
the
royal
mantle
hildegarde
am
the
prince
the
stars
have
destined
for
thee
and
with
honeyed
words
he
show
thee
how
the
mantle
in
the
loom
is
just
the
length
to
fit
shoulders
but
let
him
not
persuade
thee
to
cut
it
loose
and
give
it
him
as
thy
young
fingers
will
be
fain
to
do
weave
on
another
year
and
yet
another
till
thou
a
woman
grown
canst
measure
out
a
perfect
web
more
ample
than
these
stripling
youths
could
carry
but
which
will
fit
thy
prince
in
faultlessness
as
feathers
fit
the
falcon
hildegarde
awed
by
his
solemn
words
of
warning
took
the
silver
yardstick
and
hung
it
by
the
mirror
and
standing
before
old
hildgardmar
with
bowed
head
said
may
trust
me
father
i
will
not
cut
the
golden
warp
from
out
the
loom
until
i
a
woman
grown
have
woven
such
a
web
as
thou
thyself
shalt
say
is
worthy
of
a
prince
wearing
so
hildgardmar
left
her
with
his
blessing
and
went
back
to
his
work
after
that
the
winter
followed
the
autumn
and
the
summer
the
spring
many
times
and
the
children
played
in
the
garden
and
learned
their
lessons
of
broidery
and
fair
needlework
and
songs
upon
the
lute
and
every
day
each
stole
away
to
the
inner
room
and
threw
the
shuttle
in
and
out
among
the
threads
of
gold
hertha
worked
always
in
secret
peering
ever
in
the
mirror
lest
perchance
the
page
in
crimson
clad
should
slip
by
and
she
not
see
him
for
the
sheen
of
his
fair
hair
dazzled
her
to
all
other
sights
and
his
face
was
all
she
thought
of
by
day
and
dreamed
of
by
night
so
that
she
often
forgot
to
ply
her
needle
or
finger
her
lute
he
was
only
a
page
but
she
called
him
prince
in
her
thoughts
until
she
really
believed
him
one
when
she
worked
at
the
web
she
sang
to
herself
is
for
him
for
him
huberta
laughed
openly
about
her
web
and
her
father
often
teased
her
about
the
one
for
whom
it
was
intended
saying
when
the
village
lads
went
by
thy
prince
or
it
for
this
one
thou
weavest
but
he
never
went
with
her
into
that
inner
room
so
he
never
knew
whether
the
weaving
was
done
well
or
and
he
never
knew
that
she
cut
the
web
of
one
year
weaving
and
gave
it
to
the
curly
shepherd
lad
he
wore
it
with
jaunty
grace
at
first
and
huberta
spent
long
hours
at
the
mirror
watching
to
see
him
pass
by
all
wrapped
within
its
folds
but
it
grew
tarnished
after
awhile
from
his
long
tramps
over
the
dirty
moors
after
his
flocks
and
huberta
saw
other
figures
in
the
mirror
which
pleased
her
fancy
and
she
began
another
web
and
that
she
gave
to
a
student
in
cap
and
gown
and
the
next
to
a
troubadour
strolling
past
her
window
and
the
next
to
a
knight
in
armour
who
rode
by
one
idle
summer
day
the
years
went
by
she
scattering
her
favours
to
whomsoever
called
her
sweetheart
with
vows
of
devotion
and
hertha
faithful
to
the
page
alone
hildegarde
worked
on
true
to
her
promise
but
there
came
a
time
when
a
face
shone
across
her
mirror
so
noble
and
fair
that
she
started
back
in
a
flutter
surely
is
he
she
whispered
to
her
father
eyes
are
so
blue
they
fill
all
my
dreams
but
old
hildgardmar
answered
her
he
measure
up
to
the
standard
set
by
the
sterling
yardstick
for
a
prince
to
be
she
answered
sadly
to
the
measure
of
an
ordinary
man
but
see
how
perfectly
the
mantle
i
have
woven
would
fit
him
weave
on
then
he
said
kindly
hast
not
yet
reached
the
best
thou
canst
do
this
is
not
the
one
written
for
thee
in
the
stars
a
long
time
after
a
knight
flashed
across
the
mirror
blue
a
knight
like
sir
lancelot
his
broad
clear
brow
in
sunlight
glowed
on
burnished
hooves
his
trode
from
underneath
his
helmet
flowed
his
curls
as
on
he
rode
as
he
rode
down
to
camelot
so
noble
he
was
that
she
felt
sure
that
he
was
the
one
destined
to
wear
her
mantle
and
she
went
to
her
father
saying
has
asked
for
the
robe
and
measured
by
thy
own
sterling
yardstick
it
would
fit
him
in
faultlessness
as
the
falcon
feathers
fit
the
falcon
hildgardmar
laid
the
yardstick
against
the
web
he
said
is
only
the
size
of
a
knight
it
lacks
a
handbreadth
yet
of
the
measure
of
a
prince
hildegarde
hesitated
till
he
said
beseechingly
am
an
old
man
knowing
far
more
of
the
world
and
its
ways
than
thou
my
daughter
have
i
ever
deceived
thee
have
i
ever
had
aught
but
thy
good
at
heart
have
patience
a
little
longer
another
year
and
thou
wilt
be
able
to
fashion
a
still
larger
web
at
last
it
came
to
pass
as
it
was
written
in
the
stars
a
prince
came
riding
by
to
ask
for
hertha
as
his
bride
old
herthold
taking
her
by
the
hand
said
i
will
lead
thee
into
the
inner
room
and
teach
thee
how
to
use
the
fairy
sacred
gift
with
me
for
a
teacher
thou
canst
surely
make
no
mistake
when
they
came
into
the
inner
room
there
stood
only
the
empty
loom
from
which
the
golden
warp
had
been
clipped
now
he
demanded
angrily
hertha
braving
his
said
defiantly
art
too
late
because
i
feared
thy
scorn
of
what
thou
wast
pleased
to
call
my
childish
foolishness
i
wove
in
secret
and
when
my
prince
came
by
long
ago
i
gave
it
him
he
stands
outside
at
the
casement
the
astonished
herthold
turning
in
a
rage
saw
the
page
clad
in
the
mantle
which
she
had
woven
in
secret
he
tore
it
angrily
from
the
youth
and
demanded
she
should
give
it
to
the
prince
who
waited
to
claim
it
but
the
prince
would
have
none
of
it
it
was
of
too
small
a
fashion
to
fit
his
royal
shoulders
and
had
been
defiled
by
the
wearing
of
a
common
page
so
with
one
look
of
disdain
he
rode
away
stripped
of
the
robe
her
own
fancy
had
woven
around
him
the
page
stood
shorn
before
her
it
was
as
if
a
veil
had
been
torn
from
her
eyes
and
she
no
longer
saw
him
as
her
fond
dreams
had
painted
him
she
saw
him
in
all
his
unworthiness
and
the
cloth
of
gold
which
was
her
and
the
rosy
she
had
woven
into
it
to
make
the
mantle
of
a
high
ideal
lay
in
tattered
shreds
at
her
feet
when
she
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
and
saw
the
mistake
she
had
made
and
the
opportunity
she
had
lost
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
cried
out
to
herthold
is
thy
fault
thou
shouldst
not
have
laughed
my
childish
questions
to
scorn
and
driven
me
to
weave
in
ignorance
and
in
secret
but
all
her
upbraiding
was
too
late
as
it
was
written
in
the
stars
her
heart
broke
as
broke
the
shattered
mirror
of
the
lady
of
shalott
that
same
day
came
a
prince
to
hubert
asking
for
his
daughter
he
called
her
from
the
garden
saying
gaily
forth
the
mantle
now
huberta
surely
it
must
be
a
goodly
one
after
all
these
years
of
weaving
at
thy
own
sweet
will
she
brought
it
forth
but
when
he
saw
it
he
started
back
aghast
at
its
pigmy
size
when
he
demanded
the
reason
she
confessed
with
tears
that
she
had
no
more
of
the
golden
warp
that
was
clotho
sacred
gift
she
had
squandered
that
in
the
bygone
years
to
make
the
mantles
she
had
so
thoughtlessly
bestowed
upon
the
shepherd
lad
and
the
troubadour
the
student
and
the
knight
this
was
all
she
had
left
to
give
said
her
father
at
length
only
what
many
another
has
done
in
the
wanton
foolishness
of
youth
but
perchance
when
the
prince
sees
how
fair
thou
art
and
how
sweetly
thou
dost
sing
to
thy
lute
he
may
overlook
the
paltriness
of
thy
offering
take
it
to
him
when
she
had
laid
it
before
him
he
cast
only
one
glance
at
it
so
small
it
was
so
meagre
of
gold
thread
so
unmeet
for
a
true
wearing
then
he
looked
sorrowfully
into
the
depths
of
her
beautiful
eyes
and
turned
away
the
gaze
burned
into
her
very
soul
and
revealed
to
her
all
that
she
had
lost
for
evermore
she
cried
out
to
her
father
with
pitiful
sobs
that
set
his
heartstrings
in
a
quiver
is
fault
why
didst
thou
not
warn
me
what
a
precious
gift
was
the
gold
warp
clotho
gave
me
why
didst
thou
say
to
me
is
the
lad
is
that
the
lad
till
i
looked
only
at
the
village
churls
and
wove
my
web
to
fit
their
unworthy
shoulders
and
forgot
how
high
is
the
stature
of
a
perfect
prince
then
hiding
her
face
she
fled
away
and
as
it
was
written
in
the
stars
her
heart
broke
as
broke
the
shattered
mirror
of
the
lady
of
shalott
then
came
the
prince
to
hildegarde
all
blushing
and
aflutter
she
clipped
the
threads
that
held
the
golden
web
of
her
through
which
ran
all
her
happy
girlish
and
let
him
take
it
from
her
glancing
shyly
up
she
saw
that
it
fitted
him
in
all
faultlessness
as
the
falcon
feathers
fit
the
falcon
then
old
hildgardmar
stretching
out
his
hands
said
even
in
childhood
days
thou
ever
kept
in
view
the
sterling
yardstick
as
i
bade
thee
because
no
single
strand
of
all
the
golden
warp
that
clotho
gave
thee
was
squandered
on
another
because
thou
waitedst
till
thy
fingers
wrought
the
best
that
lay
within
thy
woman
heart
all
happiness
shall
now
be
thine
receive
it
as
thy
perfect
crown
so
with
her
father
blessing
light
upon
her
she
rode
away
beside
the
prince
and
ever
after
all
her
life
was
crowned
with
happiness
as
it
had
been
written
for
her
in
the
stars
there
was
a
moment
silence
when
walton
ceased
speaking
the
fire
had
died
down
until
only
a
fitful
glimmer
lighted
the
thoughtful
faces
of
the
girls
grouped
around
her
on
the
then
kitty
said
impulsively
of
course
hertha
means
ida
and
you
want
us
all
to
be
hildegardes
but
who
is
huberta
mittie
dupong
of
course
answered
allison
and
flynn
willis
and
cad
bailey
and
all
that
set
we
were
so
disgusted
with
at
carter
party
did
you
mean
them
mother
yes
said
walton
well
pleased
that
the
tale
had
been
interpreted
so
quickly
i
must
confess
that
i
told
the
story
solely
for
the
moral
i
wanted
to
tack
on
to
the
end
of
it
you
do
not
know
how
my
heart
has
ached
for
ida
poor
misguided
child
from
what
i
have
heard
of
her
aunt
i
think
she
must
be
like
hertha
father
and
made
ida
feel
that
she
had
no
sympathy
with
her
childish
then
ida
made
the
mistake
that
hertha
did
wove
her
ideals
in
secret
and
fitted
them
on
the
first
boy
who
pleased
her
fancy
once
wrapped
in
them
she
was
blind
to
all
his
faults
and
could
not
judge
him
as
other
people
did
she
made
a
hero
of
him
i
blame
her
aunt
as
much
as
i
do
her
because
she
did
not
teach
her
long
ago
as
hildgardmar
did
his
daughter
little
girls
begin
very
early
sometimes
to
dream
about
that
land
of
romance
the
teasing
questions
older
people
ask
them
often
set
them
to
thinking
seriously
of
it
they
call
their
little
playmates
their
sweethearts
and
imagine
the
admiration
and
fondness
they
have
for
them
is
the
love
that
is
written
in
the
stars
nobody
explains
to
them
that
they
will
outgrow
their
early
ideals
as
they
do
their
dresses
i
can
remember
how
my
ideals
used
to
change
when
i
was
a
little
girl
about
as
old
as
elise
i
thought
that
my
prince
charming
would
be
like
the
one
in
the
story
of
the
sleeping
beauty
i
dreamed
of
sitting
all
day
beside
him
on
a
crystal
throne
with
a
crown
on
my
head
and
a
sceptre
in
my
hand
but
as
i
grew
older
i
realized
how
stupid
that
would
be
and
i
fashioned
him
after
the
figures
that
flitted
across
my
mirror
in
the
world
of
books
he
was
as
handsome
as
a
greek
god
and
the
feats
he
performed
could
have
been
possible
only
in
the
days
of
the
round
table
then
i
outgrew
that
ideal
others
took
its
place
but
when
a
woman
grown
i
held
up
the
one
that
was
the
best
my
woman
heart
could
fashion
i
found
that
my
prince
measured
just
to
the
stature
of
an
honest
man
simple
and
earnest
and
true
that
was
all
no
greek
god
no
dashing
knight
but
a
strong
manly
man
whose
love
was
my
life
crown
of
happiness
she
glanced
up
at
the
portrait
over
the
mantel
and
there
was
an
impressive
pause
lloyd
broke
the
silence
presently
speaking
very
fast
in
an
embarrassed
sort
of
way
but
walton
do
you
think
there
was
some
excuse
for
ida
besides
her
being
blinded
to
mistah
bannon
faults
he
made
her
believe
she
had
such
a
good
influence
ovah
him
that
she
thought
it
was
her
to
disobey
her
aunt
because
it
was
moah
important
that
he
should
be
reformed
than
that
she
should
be
obeyed
in
a
mattah
that
seemed
unreasonable
to
ida
yes
was
the
hesitating
answer
but
ida
was
largely
influenced
to
take
that
stand
by
the
books
she
had
been
reading
that
another
matter
i
want
to
speak
about
since
my
little
girls
have
confessed
to
the
reading
of
dale
and
the
of
dorn
while
there
is
nothing
particularly
objectionable
in
such
books
in
one
way
in
another
their
influence
is
of
the
very
worst
the
characters
are
either
unreal
or
overdrawn
or
they
are
so
interestingly
coloured
that
they
are
like
the
figures
of
the
shepherd
lad
and
the
page
in
the
mirrors
of
hertha
and
huberta
in
watching
them
a
girl
is
apt
to
weave
her
web
fit
unworthy
shoulders
and
forget
how
high
is
the
stature
of
a
perfect
prince
such
books
are
poor
yardsticks
and
give
one
false
ideas
of
value
and
measurement
ned
plea
is
what
nearly
every
wild
young
fellow
makes
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
appeals
to
a
girl
more
than
any
other
argument
he
could
use
the
mantle
hildegarde
it
will
help
me
to
live
right
so
she
takes
him
in
hand
to
reform
him
nothing
could
be
purer
and
higher
than
the
motives
which
prompt
her
to
sacrifice
everything
to
what
she
considers
her
duty
i
had
a
schoolmate
once
who
married
a
bright
young
fellow
because
he
came
to
her
with
ned
plea
her
father
said
him
reform
first
what
he
will
not
do
for
a
sweetheart
he
will
never
do
for
a
wife
but
she
would
not
listen
and
she
is
living
in
abject
poverty
and
cruel
unhappiness
he
is
rarely
sober
in
olden
times
a
man
did
come
whining
to
a
maiden
and
say
long
to
be
a
knight
but
i
am
too
weak
to
do
battle
unaided
be
my
ladye
fair
and
help
me
win
my
spurs
no
she
would
have
laughed
him
to
scorn
he
won
his
spurs
first
and
only
after
he
had
proved
himself
worthy
and
received
his
accolade
did
she
give
him
her
hand
oh
my
dear
girls
if
you
would
do
as
hildegarde
did
ask
first
if
all
be
well
before
you
clip
the
golden
web
from
the
loom
and
give
it
to
the
one
who
begs
for
it
he
is
not
the
one
written
for
you
in
the
stars
he
does
not
measure
to
the
stature
of
a
true
prince
if
he
comes
with
such
a
selfish
demand
as
ned
did
that
is
a
story
i
nevah
forget
said
lloyd
soberly
i
think
it
ought
to
be
printed
and
put
in
the
seminary
library
for
all
the
othah
girls
to
read
and
some
of
the
fathers
and
mothers
too
added
betty
ida
aunt
ought
to
have
a
copy
no
it
is
too
late
remarked
katie
it
a
case
of
what
grandpa
would
call
the
stable
after
the
horse
is
stolen
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
supper
is
served
announced
voice
in
the
hall
chapter
xv
thanksgiving
day
one
might
have
thought
watching
the
which
went
on
that
night
at
bedtime
that
the
had
been
told
too
soon
the
five
girls
romping
and
shrieking
through
halls
and
bedrooms
as
the
sport
went
on
fast
and
furious
seemed
too
young
for
its
grave
lessons
but
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
even
when
its
actions
are
most
childish
and
careless
and
the
little
tale
made
a
deeper
impression
than
the
teller
of
it
realized
for
one
thing
betty
laid
aside
the
book
she
was
writing
although
she
had
secretly
cherished
the
hope
of
having
the
story
of
gladys
and
eugene
published
sometime
during
the
coming
year
i
might
be
ashamed
of
it
when
i
am
grown
she
explained
quoting
old
hildgardmar
but
a
little
mantle
thou
couldst
weave
this
year
at
best
fit
but
to
clothe
the
shoulders
of
yon
curly
shepherd
lad
if
i
am
to
outgrow
my
ideals
as
i
do
my
dresses
i
ought
to
wait
i
want
the
critics
to
say
of
me
waitedst
till
thy
woman
fingers
wrought
the
best
that
lay
within
thy
woman
heart
so
i
lay
the
book
aside
for
a
few
years
till
i
learned
more
about
people
but
i
write
it
some
day
it
was
that
same
night
while
they
were
getting
ready
for
bed
that
the
shadow
club
was
disbanded
i
nevah
want
to
heah
that
name
again
exclaimed
lloyd
shaking
out
her
hair
and
beginning
to
brush
it
it
was
so
disgraced
by
being
dragged
into
the
newspapahs
with
such
a
lie
that
it
almost
makes
me
ill
whenevah
i
think
of
it
oh
you
do
want
to
give
up
the
work
for
the
mountain
people
do
you
asked
allison
in
dismay
no
but
i
like
to
stop
until
aftah
the
holidays
we
have
so
much
to
do
getting
ready
for
christmas
besides
i
like
to
be
able
to
tell
the
girls
that
there
was
such
a
club
any
moah
the
next
term
we
could
make
a
fresh
start
with
a
new
name
just
the
five
of
us
oh
let
call
it
order
of
hildegarde
cried
betty
enthusiastically
and
all
the
time
we
are
doing
and
fair
needlework
to
sell
for
the
mountain
people
we
can
be
trying
to
weave
our
ideals
as
hildegarde
did
so
that
we
may
not
miss
the
happiness
that
is
written
for
us
in
the
stars
i
like
that
exclaimed
allison
entering
into
the
new
plan
eagerly
we
could
have
club
colours
this
time
gold
and
rose
the
colour
of
the
warp
and
woof
you
know
yes
yes
that
it
assented
kitty
with
equal
enthusiasm
streamers
of
narrow
gold
and
rose
ribbon
pinned
by
a
tiny
gilt
star
to
remind
us
of
what
is
written
in
the
stars
do
you
think
that
would
be
lovely
katie
yes
answered
katie
but
i
think
if
we
want
to
keep
the
order
a
secret
we
ought
to
wear
such
a
badge
in
public
it
would
be
safer
to
keep
them
in
our
rooms
but
we
could
use
them
in
all
sorts
of
ways
the
ribbons
crossed
on
our
pincushions
or
streamers
of
them
to
tie
back
our
curtains
or
broad
bands
on
our
and
lloyd
gave
ready
assent
that
would
suit
me
for
my
room
at
home
is
already
furnished
in
rose
colah
all
i
would
have
to
do
is
to
add
the
gold
and
the
and
mine
is
a
white
and
gold
room
said
betty
i
only
have
to
give
it
a
few
touches
of
rose
colour
a
few
more
words
settled
the
matter
as
the
girls
hovered
around
the
fire
in
their
and
then
the
establishment
of
the
new
order
of
hildegarde
was
celebrated
by
a
pillow
fight
the
like
of
which
for
noise
and
vigour
had
never
before
been
known
at
the
beeches
in
the
hard
work
that
followed
after
their
return
to
school
time
slipped
by
so
fast
that
thanksgiving
day
came
surprisingly
soon
nearly
all
the
pupils
and
teachers
went
home
for
the
short
vacation
or
visited
friends
in
louisville
even
the
president
and
his
wife
went
away
only
six
girls
besides
lloyd
and
betty
were
left
to
follow
the
matron
to
church
on
thanksgiving
morning
it
was
a
lonesome
walk
a
stillness
pervaded
the
quiet
valley
and
the
ringing
of
the
bell
in
the
belfry
of
the
little
stone
church
and
the
closed
doors
at
the
gave
the
girls
the
feeling
that
sunday
had
somehow
come
in
the
middle
of
the
week
as
they
crossed
the
road
toward
the
iron
gate
leading
into
the
churchyard
lloyd
looked
up
past
the
manse
toward
the
beeches
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
the
walton
girls
then
she
remembered
that
allison
had
told
her
that
they
were
all
going
to
town
to
celebrate
the
day
with
her
aunt
elise
and
the
feeling
of
being
left
out
of
everybody
good
times
began
to
weigh
heavily
upon
her
no
smoke
was
coming
out
of
any
of
the
chimneys
either
at
the
beeches
or
edgewood
when
she
thought
of
locust
also
cold
and
empty
with
no
fire
on
its
hospitable
hearths
no
feast
on
its
ample
table
no
cheer
anywhere
within
its
walls
and
her
family
far
away
a
wave
of
homesickness
swept
over
her
that
brought
a
mist
over
her
eyes
she
could
scarcely
see
as
they
went
up
the
steps
mrs
bond
with
her
usual
dread
of
being
late
had
hurried
them
away
from
the
seminary
much
too
soon
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
carriages
had
driven
into
the
grove
around
the
little
country
church
when
they
reached
the
door
and
only
a
few
people
were
waiting
inside
as
lloyd
sat
in
the
solemn
silence
that
was
broken
only
now
and
then
by
a
stifled
cough
or
the
rustle
of
a
turning
leaf
she
had
hard
work
to
battle
back
the
tears
but
with
a
sudden
determination
to
overcome
such
a
feeling
she
sat
up
very
straight
in
the
end
of
the
pew
and
pressed
her
lips
together
hard
it
almost
wicked
of
me
she
thought
to
feel
so
bad
about
the
one
thing
i
ca
have
when
there
are
a
thousand
other
things
that
ought
to
make
me
happy
it
only
a
of
my
experiences
and
will
be
ovah
in
a
little
while
i
do
suppose
anybody
in
church
has
moah
to
be
thankful
for
than
i
have
she
glanced
furtively
across
the
aisle
i
thankful
that
i
not
that
old
mistah
saxon
with
his
wooden
leg
or
that
poah
little
mrs
crisp
in
the
cawnah
with
five
children
to
and
one
of
them
a
baby
that
has
fits
her
gaze
wandered
down
the
opposite
aisle
and
i
suah
it
something
to
be
thankful
for
not
to
have
a
nose
like
libbie
simms
or
such
a
fussy
old
fathah
as
sue
bell
wade
has
to
put
up
with
and
i
glad
i
such
poah
taste
as
to
make
a
rainbow
out
of
myself
wearing
so
many
different
colahs
at
once
as
miss
mcgill
does
five
different
shades
of
red
on
the
same
hat
are
enough
to
set
one
teeth
on
edge
i
believe
i
could
go
on
all
day
counting
the
things
i
glad
i
have
got
and
as
for
the
things
i
have
she
began
checking
them
off
on
her
there
was
a
handful
before
she
had
fairly
begun
to
count
home
family
perfect
health
the
love
of
many
friends
the
opportunities
that
filled
every
day
to
the
brim
the
organist
pulled
out
the
stops
and
began
playing
an
old
familiar
chant
as
a
voluntary
as
the
full
sweet
chords
filled
the
church
lloyd
could
almost
hear
the
words
rising
with
the
music
my
cup
runneth
over
surely
goodness
and
mercy
shall
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
as
the
music
swelled
louder
her
counting
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
several
generations
of
the
moore
family
who
had
come
back
to
oaklea
for
a
thanksgiving
reunion
it
seemed
good
to
lloyd
to
see
the
old
judge
white
head
gleaming
like
silver
in
its
accustomed
pew
his
benign
face
fairly
radiated
cheerfulness
and
as
he
took
his
place
once
more
among
his
old
neighbours
rob
walked
just
behind
him
so
tall
and
erect
it
seemed
to
lloyd
that
he
must
have
grown
several
inches
in
the
three
short
months
since
they
had
cut
the
last
notches
in
the
as
he
turned
to
throw
his
overcoat
across
the
back
of
the
seat
his
quick
glance
spied
lloyd
and
betty
several
pews
in
the
rear
and
he
flashed
them
a
smile
of
greeting
at
the
same
time
so
quickly
and
deftly
that
mrs
bond
did
not
see
the
motion
he
held
up
a
package
that
he
had
carried
in
under
his
overcoat
and
instantly
dropped
it
out
of
sight
again
on
the
seat
then
he
straightened
himself
up
beside
his
grandfather
as
if
he
were
a
model
of
decorum
illustration
like
a
bit
of
home
to
see
you
again
lloyd
and
betty
exchanged
a
meaning
glance
which
seemed
to
say
that
box
of
huyler
best
he
promised
us
and
lloyd
found
herself
wondering
several
times
during
the
long
service
how
he
would
manage
to
present
it
that
problem
did
not
worry
rob
however
as
the
congregation
slowly
moved
down
the
aisles
and
out
into
the
vestibule
he
elbowed
his
way
to
mrs
bond
standing
beside
her
eight
charges
like
a
motherly
old
hen
good
morning
mrs
bond
he
exclaimed
in
his
straightforward
boyish
way
you
going
to
take
me
under
your
wing
and
let
me
walk
to
the
gate
with
betty
and
lloyd
are
you
i
be
as
good
as
grandfather
if
you
will
and
i
even
take
him
along
if
it
necessary
to
have
anybody
to
vouch
for
me
his
mischievous
smile
was
so
irresistible
that
she
gave
him
a
motherly
pat
on
the
shoulder
run
along
she
exclaimed
laughingly
follow
presently
there
are
several
people
i
want
to
speak
to
first
oh
rob
exclaimed
lloyd
as
he
started
down
the
avenue
beside
her
and
betty
it
like
a
bit
of
home
to
see
you
again
talk
fast
and
tell
us
everything
do
you
think
you
pass
in
latin
is
it
decided
whethah
you
to
go
east
to
school
aftah
christmas
did
you
see
that
awful
piece
in
the
papah
about
our
club
she
poured
out
her
questions
so
rapidly
that
they
were
to
the
seminary
before
he
could
answer
all
her
catechism
and
then
he
had
so
many
to
ask
her
that
she
almost
forgot
to
tell
him
about
the
box
they
had
received
from
locust
that
morning
a
suah
enough
she
exclaimed
gleefully
just
as
if
we
really
been
away
off
from
home
at
school
with
all
the
good
things
that
mom
beck
could
think
of
or
aunt
cindy
could
cook
from
a
turkey
to
a
monstrous
big
mothah
planned
the
surprise
before
she
went
away
think
of
the
gay
midnight
suppahs
we
could
have
if
we
turned
ovah
a
new
leaf
and
refawmed
so
you
reformed
he
repeated
then
life
ca
seem
as
funny
to
you
as
you
thought
last
september
it
was
going
to
be
yes
it
does
protested
betty
i
be
glad
when
the
next
four
weeks
are
over
so
that
we
can
go
back
to
locust
but
excepting
only
two
or
three
things
that
happened
i
enjoyed
every
minute
that
we
been
at
the
seminary
i
always
be
glad
that
we
had
this
experience
and
it
was
at
all
like
you
said
it
would
be
added
lloyd
laughingly
oatmeal
and
dried
apples
and
old
cats
watching
at
every
keyhole
there
was
some
eavesdropping
but
it
was
the
teachahs
who
did
it
and
we
had
moah
fun
getting
even
with
the
girl
who
did
than
i
could
tell
in
a
week
i
tell
you
about
our
playing
ghost
and
all
the
rest
when
you
come
out
christmas
then
i
have
to
hand
over
the
candy
he
said
you
earned
it
if
you
stood
the
strain
this
long
and
kept
as
hale
and
hearty
as
you
look
they
had
reached
the
high
green
picket
gate
by
this
time
and
delivering
the
box
to
the
girls
with
a
few
more
words
he
left
them
dinner
was
to
be
early
at
oaklea
he
said
as
they
were
all
going
home
on
the
five
train
oh
it
was
just
like
having
a
piece
of
home
to
see
him
again
exclaimed
lloyd
looking
after
him
wistfully
as
he
lifted
his
cap
and
walked
rapidly
away
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
back
now
would
you
like
to
walk
up
to
locust
aftah
dinnah
betty
no
i
believe
not
was
the
hesitating
reply
it
would
make
me
feel
more
homesick
than
if
i
stayed
away
altogether
mom
beck
will
be
off
keeping
holiday
somewhere
and
everything
will
be
shut
up
and
probably
all
we
see
would
be
lad
and
tarbaby
out
in
the
pasture
let
walk
over
to
rollington
instead
after
dinner
and
take
a
lot
of
things
to
that
poor
little
mrs
crisp
out
of
our
box
from
home
how
funny
for
you
to
think
of
the
same
thing
that
i
did
this
mawning
in
church
exclaimed
lloyd
the
text
made
me
think
of
it
and
when
i
looked
across
at
her
in
that
pitiful
old
wispy
crape
veil
and
thought
of
the
washing
she
has
to
do
and
the
baby
with
the
fits
i
was
so
thankful
that
i
was
not
in
her
place
that
i
felt
as
if
i
ought
to
give
her
every
penny
i
possess
it
was
a
very
quiet
day
a
better
dinner
than
usual
and
the
long
walk
over
to
rollington
late
in
the
afternoon
was
all
that
made
it
differ
from
the
sundays
that
they
had
spent
at
the
seminary
but
as
the
two
little
good
samaritans
trudged
homeward
over
the
frozen
pike
swinging
their
empty
basket
between
them
lloyd
exclaimed
i
had
a
good
time
aftah
all
and
i
would
have
been
perfectly
if
i
gone
on
the
way
i
out
to
do
thinking
about
the
one
thing
i
wanted
and
could
have
i
just
myself
stop
and
go
to
thinking
of
the
things
i
did
have
and
then
i
forgot
to
feel
homesick
counting
yoah
blessings
and
carrying
turkey
to
poah
folks
does
sound
like
a
very
exciting
way
to
spend
yoah
holidays
but
it
makes
you
feel
mighty
good
inside
does
it
especially
when
you
think
how
pleased
mrs
crisp
was
yes
answered
betty
i
do
know
how
to
express
the
way
the
day
has
made
me
feel
not
happy
exactly
for
when
i
that
way
i
always
want
to
sing
she
held
her
muff
against
her
cold
face
it
more
like
a
big
soft
furry
kind
of
contentment
if
i
were
a
cat
i
be
purring
chapter
xvi
christmas
greens
and
embers
there
is
a
chapter
in
betty
good
times
book
which
tells
all
about
that
last
day
at
the
seminary
before
the
christmas
vacation
of
the
hurried
packing
and
of
her
trip
to
town
with
lloyd
to
meet
papa
jack
and
come
out
home
with
him
on
the
five
train
laden
with
christmas
packages
like
all
the
other
suburban
passengers
of
the
carriage
waiting
for
them
at
the
depot
just
as
if
they
had
been
away
at
some
school
a
long
distance
from
the
valley
and
then
the
crowning
joy
of
seeing
her
godmother
on
the
platform
waving
her
handkerchief
as
the
train
stopped
in
front
of
the
depot
they
had
not
expected
her
back
from
hot
springs
until
the
next
day
and
all
the
way
out
on
the
train
had
been
discussing
the
reception
they
intended
to
give
her
there
had
been
a
twinkle
in
sherman
eyes
as
he
listened
for
he
knew
of
this
surprise
in
store
for
them
and
had
had
a
hand
in
planning
it
it
is
all
in
betty
good
times
book
even
to
the
way
they
rolled
down
the
steps
and
fell
over
each
other
in
their
haste
to
reach
her
and
the
welcome
that
made
it
seem
more
than
ever
as
if
they
were
coming
home
from
a
long
journey
to
spend
their
christmas
vacation
just
as
thousands
of
other
schoolgirls
were
doing
all
over
the
country
then
the
drive
homeward
in
the
frosty
starlit
dusk
to
find
locust
all
a
light
in
every
window
and
a
fire
on
every
hearth
the
great
front
door
swinging
wide
on
its
hospitable
hinges
to
send
a
stream
of
light
down
the
avenue
to
meet
them
and
the
spirit
of
christmas
cheer
and
expectancy
falling
warm
upon
them
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
the
memory
of
it
would
be
something
to
be
glad
for
always
betty
thought
as
she
danced
into
the
long
after
lloyd
and
saw
the
old
colonel
start
up
from
his
chair
before
the
fire
and
come
forward
to
meet
them
the
falling
softly
on
his
silver
hair
and
smiling
face
although
betty
had
laid
aside
her
unfinished
romance
of
gladys
and
eugene
she
could
no
more
help
writing
than
a
fish
can
keep
from
swimming
and
that
is
why
her
good
times
book
held
so
many
interesting
pages
all
the
energy
and
time
that
would
have
been
put
into
the
silly
little
novel
went
instead
to
the
description
of
real
scenes
and
real
people
which
in
after
years
made
the
little
white
books
the
most
precious
volumes
in
all
her
library
as
fast
as
one
was
filled
she
began
another
the
one
now
on
her
desk
had
the
number
iv
stamped
in
gold
on
the
white
kid
cover
under
her
initials
there
were
few
pages
in
this
fourth
volume
more
interesting
than
the
ones
she
found
time
to
write
on
christmas
eve
she
had
gone
with
lloyd
and
allison
and
kitty
that
afternoon
in
search
for
christmas
greens
with
which
to
decorate
the
house
malcolm
and
keith
maclntyre
rob
moore
and
ranald
walton
had
met
them
in
tanglewood
their
guns
over
their
shoulders
and
had
joined
them
in
their
quest
the
mistletoe
they
wanted
grew
too
high
to
be
climbed
for
or
to
be
dislodged
by
throwing
at
but
ranald
an
expert
marksman
volunteered
to
shoot
down
all
they
could
carry
he
was
just
home
from
military
school
on
his
vacation
and
rob
moore
had
been
out
for
two
days
hunting
with
him
malcolm
and
keith
had
been
at
their
several
days
tramping
long
distances
over
the
frosty
fields
and
coming
in
well
satisfied
each
evening
with
the
contents
of
their
malcolm
and
rob
were
to
leave
for
the
same
school
after
the
holidays
and
as
they
were
going
back
to
town
on
the
five
train
they
had
but
a
short
time
left
to
spend
in
the
valley
so
the
party
after
some
discussion
divided
into
three
groups
agreeing
to
meet
at
the
depot
ranald
strode
away
across
the
woods
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
carry
him
to
the
trees
where
the
mistletoe
hung
kitty
and
katie
kept
close
in
his
wake
swinging
the
baskets
between
them
that
he
was
to
fill
keith
and
betty
hurried
on
to
the
place
where
the
bittersweet
grew
thickest
while
rob
and
allison
malcolm
and
lloyd
strolled
along
filling
their
baskets
from
the
occasional
trees
of
hemlock
spruce
and
cedar
they
found
on
their
way
among
the
bare
oaks
and
beeches
now
and
then
they
found
a
pine
with
the
brown
cones
clinging
to
the
spicy
boughs
only
betty
part
of
that
quest
is
in
the
little
white
record
how
they
ran
along
through
tanglewood
that
afternoon
she
and
keith
in
the
late
december
sunshine
breathing
in
the
woodsy
odour
of
the
fallen
leaves
and
the
crisp
frostiness
of
the
air
until
the
blood
tingled
in
their
and
their
cheeks
grew
red
as
rosy
apples
it
was
a
pretty
picture
she
left
on
the
page
of
the
winter
woods
of
the
old
stile
leading
into
the
adjoining
churchyard
where
in
almost
a
thicket
of
bare
and
stood
the
little
episcopal
church
built
like
the
one
next
the
manse
of
picturesque
gray
stone
the
walls
were
aglow
with
the
brilliant
red
and
orange
berries
of
the
bittersweet
which
hung
even
from
the
eaves
and
cornices
and
from
every
place
where
the
graceful
vines
could
trail
and
twist
and
clamber
lloyd
kept
no
record
of
that
afternoon
but
she
never
forgot
it
she
walked
along
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
her
cheeks
glowing
her
dark
blue
cap
and
jacket
made
her
hair
seem
all
the
fairer
by
contrast
and
there
was
a
glint
of
gold
in
it
wherever
the
sun
touched
it
through
the
trees
rob
and
malcolm
were
full
of
their
plans
for
the
coming
term
and
talked
of
little
else
all
the
way
through
the
woods
but
as
they
reached
the
stile
over
which
keith
and
betty
had
passed
some
time
before
rob
exclaimed
i
forgot
to
tell
you
lloyd
when
we
were
out
hunting
yesterday
we
stopped
at
a
cabin
ever
so
far
from
here
to
rest
and
warm
and
what
do
you
suppose
we
saw
on
the
pendulum
of
an
old
clock
swinging
away
on
the
mantel
as
big
as
life
picture
the
one
of
the
princess
you
know
with
the
dove
i
could
believe
my
eyes
at
first
the
old
man
told
us
it
had
been
given
to
his
daughter
and
when
he
found
out
who
ranald
was
he
sent
a
message
to
walton
about
her
she
in
a
hospital
and
will
soon
be
well
enough
to
come
home
walton
told
us
all
about
it
last
night
how
the
girl
imagined
every
time
the
clock
ticked
that
you
were
saying
love
will
find
the
way
it
made
quite
a
pretty
story
but
you
ca
imagine
how
queer
it
was
to
stumble
across
your
picture
in
such
an
place
and
fixed
up
in
such
odd
shape
on
a
pendulum
of
all
things
illustration
malcolm
leaning
on
his
gun
stood
watching
her
it
helped
corono
ever
so
much
mother
said
remarked
allison
one
good
thing
our
shadow
club
led
to
if
nothing
else
she
climbed
up
on
the
stile
and
stood
looking
over
exclaiming
at
the
beauty
of
the
old
gray
walls
draped
in
the
masses
of
brilliant
bittersweet
then
springing
down
ran
across
the
churchyard
to
join
betty
and
keith
on
the
other
side
and
make
her
own
selection
of
vines
rob
leaned
his
gun
against
the
fence
and
took
out
his
watch
only
half
an
hour
longer
he
announced
then
opening
the
back
of
his
he
held
it
out
toward
lloyd
do
you
remember
that
he
asked
nodding
toward
a
little
clover
which
lay
flat
and
green
inside
your
charm
worked
wonders
lloyd
it
helped
me
through
my
latin
in
such
fine
shape
that
i
intend
to
carry
it
through
college
with
me
all
the
way
it
like
the
picture
on
the
pendulum
is
it
only
this
says
will
find
the
way
as
lloyd
began
some
laughing
reply
about
his
being
superstitious
betty
voice
called
from
the
vestry
door
oh
rob
come
around
here
a
minute
please
here
the
loveliest
bunch
of
berries
you
ever
saw
and
it
too
high
for
any
one
but
you
to
reach
with
one
leap
rob
was
over
the
stile
hurrying
to
betty
assistance
lloyd
had
filled
both
pockets
of
her
jacket
with
on
her
way
through
tanglewood
and
seating
herself
on
the
top
step
of
the
stile
she
began
cracking
them
with
a
round
stone
which
she
had
picked
up
near
the
fence
malcolm
leaning
on
his
gun
stood
watching
her
you
never
gave
any
clover
lloyd
he
said
in
a
low
tone
as
rob
strode
away
you
nevah
happened
to
be
around
when
i
found
any
answered
lloyd
carelessly
have
a
nut
instead
she
nodded
toward
the
pile
on
the
step
beside
her
malcolm
flushed
a
trifle
he
was
nearly
sixteen
tall
and
but
the
colour
came
as
easily
to
his
handsome
face
now
as
when
a
little
fellow
of
ten
he
had
begged
her
to
keep
his
silver
arrow
to
remember
him
by
no
thanks
he
answered
stiffly
there
was
a
jealous
note
in
his
voice
as
he
added
and
you
would
let
me
keep
the
little
heart
of
gold
that
night
after
the
play
of
not
papa
jack
gave
me
that
i
think
everything
of
it
you
would
even
lend
it
to
me
he
continued
because
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
play
you
were
not
sir
feal
any
longah
and
you
did
have
any
shield
to
bind
it
on
so
what
good
would
it
have
done
but
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
play
he
insisted
i
thought
of
you
ever
since
as
my
princess
winsome
and
it
has
been
more
than
a
year
since
that
night
yesterday
when
i
saw
your
picture
on
the
pendulum
and
heard
how
it
had
influenced
that
girl
in
the
cabin
i
wished
that
i
could
make
you
understand
how
much
more
your
influence
means
to
me
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
you
for
something
will
you
give
it
to
me
lloyd
it
just
the
tip
of
that
little
curl
behind
your
ear
it
shines
like
gold
and
i
want
to
put
it
in
the
back
of
my
watch
as
a
talisman
like
they
used
to
carry
in
old
times
you
know
a
token
that
i
am
your
knight
and
that
i
may
do
as
it
says
in
the
song
come
back
to
you
some
glad
morrow
i
want
to
carry
it
with
me
always
as
i
shall
always
carry
your
wherever
i
go
lloyd
bent
her
head
so
far
over
the
nuts
as
she
chose
one
with
great
deliberation
that
her
hair
fell
across
the
cheek
nearest
him
and
he
could
not
see
how
red
her
face
grew
how
handsome
he
was
she
thought
how
deep
and
clear
his
eyes
looked
as
they
smiled
into
hers
if
she
had
never
known
of
ida
mistake
if
she
had
never
heard
the
hildegarde
story
there
might
have
crept
into
her
girlish
fancy
young
though
she
was
the
thought
that
this
was
the
love
written
for
her
in
the
stars
but
like
a
flash
came
the
recollection
of
old
hildgardmar
warning
many
youths
will
come
to
thee
each
begging
me
the
royal
mantle
hildegarde
i
am
the
prince
the
stars
have
destined
for
thee
and
then
his
words
of
blessing
even
in
childhood
days
thou
ever
kept
in
view
the
sterling
yardstick
as
i
bade
thee
because
no
single
strand
of
all
the
golden
warp
that
clotho
gave
thee
was
squandered
on
another
because
thou
waitedst
till
thy
woman
fingers
wrought
the
best
that
lay
within
thy
woman
heart
all
happiness
shall
now
be
please
lloyd
he
asked
again
in
a
low
earnest
tone
i
i
ca
malcolm
she
stammered
giving
the
nut
she
had
chosen
a
sudden
blow
that
completely
smashed
it
why
not
you
gave
rob
the
clover
to
carry
in
watch
that
was
different
rob
does
care
for
the
clovah
on
my
account
he
carries
it
for
the
good
luck
it
brings
not
because
i
gave
it
to
him
but
he
get
to
caring
after
awhile
said
malcolm
moodily
he
could
help
it
nobody
could
who
knew
you
and
i
do
want
him
to
then
after
a
long
pause
in
which
lloyd
attended
so
strictly
to
her
that
she
did
not
even
glance
in
his
direction
he
asked
jealously
would
you
give
the
curl
if
he
asked
for
it
something
in
his
tone
made
lloyd
look
up
with
a
provoking
little
smile
no
she
answered
not
even
the
snippiest
little
snip
of
a
hair
if
he
asked
for
it
the
way
you
are
doing
and
wanted
it
to
mean
what
you
do
that
he
was
my
my
chosen
knight
you
know
is
there
you
would
give
it
to
lloyd
his
persistence
only
made
her
shake
her
head
the
more
obstinately
it
did
not
take
much
teasing
to
arouse
what
mom
beck
called
the
lloyd
no
i
tell
you
and
if
you
keep
on
talking
that
way
i
going
home
why
wo
you
let
me
talk
that
way
this
is
the
last
time
i
see
you
until
next
summer
and
i
dreadfully
in
earnest
lloyd
you
do
know
how
much
it
means
to
me
do
you
care
for
me
at
all
a
dozen
things
came
crowding
up
to
her
lips
in
answer
she
wanted
to
tell
him
the
story
of
hildegarde
weaving
and
old
warning
she
wanted
to
say
that
she
could
not
trifle
with
the
happiness
that
was
written
for
her
in
the
stars
by
giving
away
even
a
strand
of
clotho
golden
thread
before
she
was
old
enough
to
choose
wisely
the
one
on
whom
to
bestow
such
a
favour
but
she
knew
that
he
would
not
understand
these
allusions
to
a
story
of
which
he
had
never
heard
she
did
not
know
how
to
put
into
words
the
vague
undefined
feeling
that
she
had
that
he
must
not
come
to
her
with
such
speeches
until
he
had
won
his
spurs
and
received
his
accolade
it
was
her
helplessness
to
answer
as
she
wished
that
made
her
spring
up
impatiently
and
say
in
her
most
imperious
little
way
did
you
heah
me
tell
you
to
stop
talking
that
way
malcolm
maclntyre
of
i
care
for
you
always
liked
you
and
i
think
you
one
of
the
nicest
boys
i
know
but
i
wo
if
you
keep
on
that
way
when
i
tell
you
to
stop
you
might
at
least
wait
till
you
come
back
from
college
and
let
me
see
what
sawt
of
a
man
you
turned
out
to
be
i
be
whatever
you
want
me
to
be
lloyd
he
began
but
just
then
the
mistletoe
gatherers
came
running
down
the
path
toward
them
and
whistle
brought
the
others
from
the
churchyard
with
their
bittersweet
lloyd
flung
away
her
and
standing
on
the
top
of
the
stile
brushed
her
dress
with
her
handkerchief
malcolm
swinging
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
picked
up
her
basket
and
walked
beside
her
in
conscious
silence
as
the
merry
party
strolled
on
toward
the
depot
several
times
she
glanced
up
shyly
at
him
saying
to
herself
again
that
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
nicest
boys
she
knew
the
most
courteous
the
most
attractive
with
the
same
beauty
of
face
and
polish
of
manner
that
had
made
him
such
a
winning
little
knight
of
kentucky
but
the
little
pin
he
had
worn
as
the
badge
of
that
knighthood
that
stood
for
the
wearing
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
was
no
longer
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
he
had
laid
it
aside
more
than
a
year
ago
saying
that
he
had
outgrown
that
child
play
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
fellow
of
his
age
to
live
up
to
it
as
lloyd
noticed
its
absence
she
was
glad
that
she
had
answered
him
as
she
did
but
almost
with
the
same
breath
came
the
recollection
that
he
had
said
i
be
whatever
you
want
me
to
be
lloyd
and
she
wondered
with
a
quicker
if
it
were
really
so
that
she
had
power
to
wield
such
an
influence
over
him
and
she
wondered
also
if
she
had
given
him
the
curl
as
he
asked
and
told
him
that
she
wanted
him
to
wear
the
white
flower
again
and
live
up
to
its
meaning
if
he
would
have
done
it
for
her
sake
keith
rushed
on
ahead
to
see
if
the
man
had
brought
their
down
to
the
and
the
others
crossed
over
to
the
store
for
some
hot
there
were
several
holly
wreaths
hanging
in
the
window
and
although
lloyd
knew
that
a
number
of
them
had
already
been
sent
out
to
locust
from
town
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
buying
the
largest
one
there
it
was
so
unusually
bright
and
full
of
berries
they
had
barely
reached
the
again
when
the
train
came
thundering
along
the
track
with
hasty
the
three
boys
hurried
up
the
steps
keith
and
rob
hung
on
to
the
railing
on
the
platform
of
the
rear
car
swinging
their
caps
and
calling
back
various
messages
about
christmas
and
next
week
and
after
the
holidays
but
malcolm
after
one
long
look
into
the
little
colonel
eyes
turned
and
went
into
the
car
he
wanted
to
carry
away
with
him
undisturbed
the
picture
she
made
as
she
stood
there
on
the
platform
waving
her
handkerchief
she
was
all
in
dark
blue
her
fair
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
her
cheeks
a
delicate
wild
rose
pink
at
her
feet
was
the
basket
of
christmas
greens
and
on
her
arm
hung
the
glowing
wreath
of
christmas
holly
it
was
the
last
night
of
the
old
year
mom
beck
called
it
and
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
she
and
aunt
cindy
and
alec
hurried
away
to
brier
creek
church
where
the
coloured
people
were
to
hold
services
till
midnight
watching
the
old
year
out
and
the
new
year
in
it
had
been
a
busy
week
for
lloyd
and
betty
the
happiest
of
christmas
days
had
been
followed
by
neighbourhood
parties
entertainments
and
merrymakings
of
all
descriptions
the
old
southern
mansion
rang
with
many
gay
young
voices
and
overflowed
with
life
for
there
were
guests
within
its
hospitable
gates
from
morning
until
night
but
now
a
lull
had
come
in
the
festivities
the
last
guest
had
departed
on
the
evening
train
and
ten
found
the
house
strangely
still
the
servants
were
all
out
betty
locked
in
her
room
busy
with
embroidery
silks
was
finishing
a
little
new
year
gift
with
which
to
surprise
her
godmother
on
the
morrow
sherman
had
gone
to
sit
with
the
old
colonel
awhile
she
had
not
been
able
to
give
him
much
of
her
time
since
their
return
to
locust
and
with
the
waning
year
he
seemed
to
want
her
to
himself
to
talk
to
him
of
his
long
long
ago
and
listen
to
his
tales
of
old
days
which
grew
dearer
with
each
passing
holiday
season
only
lloyd
and
her
father
were
left
in
the
long
she
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
keep
with
him
it
only
two
houahs
moah
mothah
she
said
beseechingly
i
sleep
late
in
the
mawning
to
make
up
for
it
i
scarcely
seen
papa
jack
since
we
came
home
and
he
going
away
so
soon
again
besides
i
nevah
did
sit
up
to
watch
a
new
yeah
come
in
so
she
had
her
way
and
sitting
on
a
low
stool
at
his
feet
with
his
hand
softly
stroking
her
hair
they
talked
of
many
things
he
began
in
a
teasing
playful
way
you
have
told
me
what
you
learned
at
little
colonel
you
must
have
absorbed
a
vast
amount
of
knowledge
when
even
your
nights
were
passed
in
such
a
learned
institution
the
face
she
turned
toward
him
was
a
very
serious
one
for
the
time
had
come
for
confession
yet
after
all
confession
did
not
seem
as
hard
as
she
had
thought
it
would
be
the
very
touch
of
his
hand
on
her
hair
made
it
easier
it
was
so
kind
and
sympathetic
she
had
always
gone
to
him
with
all
her
childish
troubles
as
freely
as
she
had
to
her
mother
presently
she
had
poured
out
the
whole
story
her
part
in
the
clandestine
correspondence
edwardo
coming
to
locust
her
struggle
in
that
very
room
to
be
loyal
to
the
family
honour
and
her
father
trust
in
her
allison
christmas
present
to
her
had
been
an
autograph
copy
of
the
story
of
the
three
weavers
it
was
bound
in
paper
tied
in
the
rose
and
gold
ribbons
of
the
order
and
bore
on
the
cover
a
design
of
allison
own
painting
a
filmy
held
by
a
row
of
golden
stars
lloyd
showed
it
to
him
as
she
told
of
the
forming
of
the
order
of
hildegarde
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
shadow
club
and
then
spreading
the
book
open
across
his
knee
read
it
aloud
the
little
tale
which
was
destined
to
play
such
an
important
part
in
her
life
and
which
already
had
influenced
her
far
more
than
she
was
aware
when
she
had
finished
she
sat
idly
turning
the
leaves
and
gazing
into
the
fire
you
see
she
said
presently
this
is
a
story
for
fathahs
and
mothahs
too
and
and
i
want
you
to
give
me
my
papa
jack
as
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
a
roguish
smile
dimpling
her
face
she
was
astonished
to
see
tears
in
his
eyes
he
had
been
very
silent
while
she
read
the
story
my
precious
little
hildegarde
he
exclaimed
drawing
her
to
his
knee
and
folding
his
arms
around
her
she
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
he
began
i
do
suppose
you
can
understand
how
i
feel
about
it
lloyd
it
breaks
me
all
up
to
think
that
my
little
colonel
is
near
enough
grown
to
come
to
me
with
such
a
request
if
i
could
have
my
way
i
would
be
selfish
enough
to
want
to
keep
you
a
little
girl
always
i
hate
to
think
that
a
time
can
ever
come
when
any
one
may
ask
to
take
you
from
me
but
lloyd
darling
it
takes
all
the
sting
out
of
that
thought
to
know
that
you
are
willing
to
come
to
me
so
freely
with
your
questions
to
know
that
there
is
such
perfect
confidence
between
us
that
you
do
not
feel
the
embarrassment
that
most
girls
feel
in
talking
with
their
fathers
on
such
a
subject
let
me
think
a
moment
for
i
want
to
answer
as
wisely
as
old
hildgardmar
did
if
that
be
possible
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
spoke
again
then
he
said
slowly
there
are
only
three
notches
on
the
yardstick
which
i
am
going
to
give
you
lloyd
the
prince
who
comes
asking
for
you
must
have
first
a
clean
life
there
must
be
no
wild
oats
sowed
through
its
past
for
my
little
girl
to
help
reap
for
no
man
ever
gathers
such
a
harvest
alone
next
he
must
be
honourable
in
every
way
which
that
good
old
word
implies
the
man
who
is
that
will
not
ask
anything
clandestine
nor
will
he
ask
to
take
you
from
a
comfortable
home
before
he
is
able
to
provide
one
for
you
himself
then
if
he
would
measure
up
to
the
third
notch
he
must
be
strong
strong
in
character
in
purpose
and
endeavour
there
are
many
things
that
i
might
ask
for
my
only
child
many
things
that
i
would
gladly
choose
for
her
if
the
choice
were
left
to
me
family
position
wealth
but
they
are
nothing
when
weighed
in
the
balance
with
the
love
of
an
honest
man
if
his
life
be
clean
and
honourable
and
strong
then
choose
as
you
will
my
blessing
shall
go
with
you
instantly
there
flashed
into
lloyd
thoughts
the
recollection
of
a
boyish
figure
standing
beside
the
old
stile
and
she
wondered
how
far
he
would
measure
up
to
that
standard
clean
in
life
and
habit
he
had
always
seemed
so
but
a
little
doubt
disturbed
her
as
she
thought
of
the
white
flower
he
no
longer
wore
and
what
he
had
said
about
it
strong
in
purpose
and
in
effort
it
was
too
soon
to
tell
he
was
only
a
boy
with
all
his
uncertain
future
before
him
with
all
the
temptations
of
his
college
days
still
unmet
and
unconquered
as
she
felt
her
father
protecting
arm
around
her
she
nestled
closer
in
that
safe
sure
shelter
and
sat
considering
what
he
had
said
once
she
glanced
up
at
the
portrait
over
the
mantel
and
met
the
gaze
of
the
beautiful
eyes
of
the
young
girl
beside
the
harp
amanthis
who
had
made
no
mistake
in
her
choosing
whose
girlish
romance
had
bloomed
as
sweetly
as
the
june
roses
that
she
wore
presently
lloyd
arm
stole
up
around
her
father
neck
and
she
softly
repeated
the
words
of
hildegarde
promise
may
trust
me
fathah
i
will
not
cut
the
golden
warp
from
out
the
loom
until
i
a
woman
grown
have
woven
such
a
web
as
thou
thyself
shalt
say
is
worthy
of
a
prince
wearing
dear
child
he
answered
huskily
you
have
crowned
not
only
this
year
for
me
but
all
the
years
with
