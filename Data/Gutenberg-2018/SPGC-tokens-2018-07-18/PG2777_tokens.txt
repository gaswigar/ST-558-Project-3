in

that

thus
far
in

from

thousand

carried

that
spans

presidente

que

it
is
characteristic
of
this
buoyant
people
that
they
pursue
no
man
beyond
the
grave
let
god
be
his
judge
even
with
the
hundred
thousand
unfound
though
greatly
coveted
the
hue
and
cry
went
no
further
than
that
to
the
stranger
or
the
guest
the
people
of
coralio
will
relate
the
story
of
the
tragic
end
of
their
former
president
how
he
strove
to
escape
from
the
country
with
the
public
funds
and
also
with
doña
isabel
guilbert
the
young
american
opera
singer
and
how
being
apprehended
by
members
of
the
opposing
political
party
in
coralio
he
shot
himself
through
the
head
rather
than
give
up
the
funds
and
in
consequence
the
señorita
guilbert
they
will
relate
further
that
doña
isabel
her
adventurous
bark
of
fortune
shoaled
by
the
simultaneous
loss
of
her
distinguished
admirer
and
the
souvenir
hundred
thousand
dropped
anchor
on
this
stagnant
coast
awaiting
a
rising
tide
they
say
in
coralio
that
she
found
a
prompt
and
prosperous
tide
in
the
form
of
frank
goodwin
an
american
resident
of
the
town
an
investor
who
had
grown
wealthy
by
dealing
in
the
products
of
the
country
a
banana
king
a
rubber
prince
a
sarsaparilla
indigo
and
mahogany
baron
the
señorita
guilbert
you
will
be
told
married
señor
goodwin
one
month
after
the
president
death
thus
in
the
very
moment
when
fortune
had
ceased
to
smile
wresting
from
her
a
gift
greater
than
the
prize
withdrawn
of
the
american
don
frank
goodwin
and
of
his
wife
the
natives
have
nothing
but
good
to
say
don
frank
has
lived
among
them
for
years
and
has
compelled
their
respect
his
lady
is
easily
queen
of
what
social
life
the
sober
coast
affords
the
wife
of
the
governor
of
the
district
herself
who
was
of
the
proud
castilian
family
of
monteleon
y
dolorosa
de
los
santos
y
mendez
feels
honoured
to
unfold
her
napkin
with
ringed
hands
at
the
table
of
señora
goodwin
were
you
to
refer
with
your
northern
prejudices
to
the
vivacious
past
of
goodwin
when
her
audacious
and
gleeful
abandon
in
light
opera
captured
the
mature
president
fancy
or
to
her
share
in
that
statesman
downfall
and
malfeasance
the
latin
shrug
of
the
shoulder
would
be
your
only
answer
and
rebuttal
what
prejudices
there
were
in
coralio
concerning
señora
goodwin
seemed
now
to
be
in
her
favour
whatever
they
had
been
in
the
past
it
would
seem
that
the
story
is
ended
instead
of
begun
that
the
close
of
tragedy
and
the
climax
of
a
romance
have
covered
the
ground
of
interest
but
to
the
more
curious
reader
it
shall
be
some
slight
instruction
to
trace
the
close
threads
that
underlie
the
ingenuous
web
of
circumstances
the
headpiece
bearing
the
name
of
president
miraflores
is
daily
scrubbed
with
and
sand
an
old
indian
tends
the
grave
with
fidelity
and
the
dawdling
minuteness
of
inherited
sloth
he
chops
down
the
weeds
and
grass
with
his
machete
he
plucks
ants
and
scorpions
and
beetles
from
it
with
his
horny
fingers
and
sprinkles
its
turf
with
water
from
the
plaza
fountain
there
is
no
grave
anywhere
so
well
kept
and
ordered
only
by
following
out
the
underlying
threads
will
it
be
made
clear
why
the
old
indian
galvez
is
secretly
paid
to
keep
green
the
grave
of
president
miraflores
by
one
who
never
saw
that
unfortunate
statesman
in
life
or
in
death
and
why
that
one
was
wont
to
walk
in
the
twilight
casting
from
a
distance
looks
of
gentle
sadness
upon
that
unhonoured
mound
elsewhere
than
at
coralio
one
learns
of
the
impetuous
career
of
isabel
guilbert
new
orleans
gave
her
birth
and
the
mingled
french
and
spanish
creole
nature
that
tinctured
her
life
with
such
turbulence
and
warmth
she
had
little
education
but
a
knowledge
of
men
and
motives
that
seemed
to
have
come
by
instinct
far
beyond
the
common
woman
was
she
endowed
with
intrepid
rashness
with
a
love
for
the
pursuit
of
adventure
to
the
brink
of
danger
and
with
desire
for
the
pleasures
of
life
her
spirit
was
one
to
chafe
under
any
curb
she
was
eve
after
the
fall
but
before
the
bitterness
of
it
was
felt
she
wore
life
as
a
rose
in
her
bosom
of
the
legion
of
men
who
had
been
at
her
feet
it
was
said
that
but
one
was
so
fortunate
as
to
engage
her
fancy
to
president
miraflores
the
brilliant
but
unstable
ruler
of
anchuria
she
yielded
the
key
to
her
resolute
heart
how
then
do
we
find
her
as
the
coralians
would
have
told
you
the
wife
of
frank
goodwin
and
happily
living
a
life
of
dull
and
dreamy
inaction
the
underlying
threads
reach
far
stretching
across
the
sea
following
them
out
it
will
be
made
plain
why
shorty
of
the
columbia
detective
agency
resigned
his
position
and
for
a
lighter
pastime
it
shall
be
a
duty
and
a
pleasing
sport
to
wander
with
momus
beneath
the
tropic
stars
where
melpomene
once
stalked
austere
now
to
cause
laughter
to
echo
from
those
lavish
jungles
and
frowning
crags
where
formerly
rang
the
cries
of
pirates
victims
to
lay
aside
pike
and
cutlass
and
attack
with
quip
and
jollity
to
draw
one
saving
titter
of
mirth
from
the
rusty
casque
of
romance
this
were
pleasant
to
do
in
the
shade
of
the
on
that
coast
that
is
curved
like
lips
set
for
smiling
for
there
are
yet
tales
of
the
spanish
main
that
segment
of
continent
washed
by
the
tempestuous
caribbean
and
presenting
to
the
sea
a
formidable
border
of
tropical
jungle
topped
by
the
overweening
cordilleras
is
still
begirt
by
mystery
and
romance
in
past
times
buccaneers
and
revolutionists
roused
the
echoes
of
its
cliffs
and
the
condor
wheeled
perpetually
above
where
in
the
green
groves
they
made
food
for
him
with
their
matchlocks
and
toledos
taken
and
retaken
by
sea
rovers
by
adverse
powers
and
by
sudden
uprising
of
rebellious
factions
the
historic
miles
of
adventurous
coast
has
scarcely
known
for
hundreds
of
years
whom
rightly
to
call
its
master
pizarro
balboa
sir
francis
drake
and
bolivar
did
what
they
could
to
make
it
a
part
of
christendom
sir
john
morgan
lafitte
and
other
eminent
bombarded
and
pounded
it
in
the
name
of
abaddon
the
game
still
goes
on
the
guns
of
the
rovers
are
silenced
but
the
tintype
man
the
enlarged
photograph
brigand
the
kodaking
tourist
and
the
scouts
of
the
gentle
brigade
of
fakirs
have
found
it
out
and
carry
on
the
work
the
hucksters
of
germany
france
and
sicily
now
bag
its
small
change
across
their
counters
gentleman
adventurers
throng
the
of
its
rulers
with
proposals
for
railways
and
concessions
the
little
nations
play
at
government
and
intrigue
until
some
day
a
big
silent
gunboat
glides
into
the
offing
and
warns
them
not
to
break
their
toys
and
with
these
changes
comes
also
the
small
adventurer
with
empty
pockets
to
fill
light
of
heart
the
modern
fairy
prince
bearing
an
alarm
clock
with
which
more
surely
than
by
the
sentimental
kiss
to
awaken
the
beautiful
tropics
from
their
centuries
sleep
generally
he
wears
a
shamrock
which
he
matches
pridefully
against
the
extravagant
palms
and
it
is
he
who
has
driven
melpomene
to
the
wings
and
set
comedy
to
dancing
before
the
footlights
of
the
southern
cross
so
there
is
a
little
tale
to
tell
of
many
things
perhaps
to
the
promiscuous
ear
of
the
walrus
it
shall
come
with
most
avail
for
in
it
there
are
indeed
shoes
and
ships
and
and
and
presidents
instead
of
kings
add
to
these
a
little
love
and
counterplotting
and
scatter
everywhere
throughout
the
maze
a
trail
of
tropical
dollars
dollars
warmed
no
more
by
the
torrid
sun
than
by
the
hot
palms
of
the
scouts
of
fortune
and
after
all
here
seems
to
be
life
itself
with
talk
enough
to
weary
the
most
garrulous
of
walruses
i
coralio
reclined
in
the
heat
like
some
vacuous
beauty
lounging
in
a
guarded
harem
the
town
lay
at
the
sea
edge
on
a
strip
of
alluvial
coast
it
was
set
like
a
little
pearl
in
an
emerald
band
behind
it
and
seeming
almost
to
topple
imminent
above
it
rose
the
range
of
the
cordilleras
in
front
the
sea
was
spread
a
smiling
jailer
but
even
more
incorruptible
than
the
frowning
mountains
the
waves
swished
along
the
smooth
beach
the
parrots
screamed
in
the
orange
and
the
palms
waved
their
limber
fronds
foolishly
like
an
awkward
chorus
at
the
prima
cue
to
enter
suddenly
the
town
was
full
of
excitement
a
native
boy
dashed
down
a
street
shrieking
el
señor
goodwin
ha
venido
un
telégrafo
por
el
the
word
passed
quickly
telegrams
do
not
often
come
to
anyone
in
coralio
the
cry
for
señor
goodwin
was
taken
up
by
a
dozen
officious
voices
the
main
street
running
parallel
to
the
beach
became
populated
with
those
who
desired
to
expedite
the
delivery
of
the
despatch
knots
of
women
with
complexions
varying
from
palest
olive
to
deepest
brown
gathered
at
street
corners
and
plaintively
carolled
telégrafo
por
señor
goodwin
the
don
señor
el
coronel
encarnación
rios
who
was
loyal
to
the
ins
and
suspected
goodwin
devotion
to
the
outs
hissed
aha
and
wrote
in
his
secret
memorandum
book
the
accusive
fact
that
señor
goodwin
had
on
that
momentous
date
received
a
telegram
in
the
midst
of
the
hullabaloo
a
man
stepped
to
the
door
of
a
small
wooden
building
and
looked
out
above
the
door
was
a
sign
that
read
keogh
and
clancy
a
nomenclature
that
seemed
not
to
be
indigenous
to
that
tropical
soil
the
man
in
the
door
was
billy
keogh
scout
of
fortune
and
progress
and
rover
of
the
spanish
main
tintypes
and
photographs
were
the
weapons
with
which
keogh
and
clancy
were
at
that
time
assailing
the
hopeless
shores
outside
the
shop
were
set
two
large
frames
filled
with
specimens
of
their
art
and
skill
keogh
leaned
in
the
doorway
his
bold
and
humorous
countenance
wearing
a
look
of
interest
at
the
unusual
influx
of
life
and
sound
into
the
street
when
the
meaning
of
the
disturbance
became
clear
to
him
he
placed
a
hand
beside
his
mouth
and
shouted
hey
frank
in
such
a
robustious
voice
that
the
feeble
clamour
of
the
natives
was
drowned
and
silenced
fifty
yards
away
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
street
stood
the
abode
of
the
consul
for
the
united
states
out
from
the
door
of
this
building
tumbled
goodwin
at
the
call
he
had
been
smoking
with
willard
geddie
the
consul
on
the
back
porch
of
the
consulate
which
was
conceded
to
be
the
coolest
spot
in
coralio
hurry
up
shouted
keogh
there
a
riot
in
town
on
account
of
a
telegram
that
come
for
you
you
want
to
be
careful
about
these
things
my
boy
it
wo
do
to
trifle
with
the
feelings
of
the
public
this
way
you
be
getting
a
pink
note
some
day
with
violet
scent
on
it
and
then
the
country
be
steeped
in
the
throes
of
a
revolution
goodwin
had
strolled
up
the
street
and
met
the
boy
with
the
message
the
women
gazed
at
him
with
shy
admiration
for
his
type
drew
them
he
was
big
blonde
and
jauntily
dressed
in
white
linen
with
buckskin
his
manner
was
courtly
with
a
sort
of
kindly
truculence
in
it
tempered
by
a
merciful
eye
when
the
telegram
had
been
delivered
and
the
bearer
of
it
dismissed
with
a
gratuity
the
relieved
populace
returned
to
the
contiguities
of
shade
from
which
curiosity
had
drawn
it
the
women
to
their
baking
in
the
mud
ovens
under
the
or
to
the
interminable
combing
of
their
long
straight
hair
the
men
to
their
cigarettes
and
gossip
in
the
cantinas
goodwin
sat
on
keogh
doorstep
and
read
his
telegram
it
was
from
bob
englehart
an
american
who
lived
in
san
mateo
the
capital
city
of
anchuria
eighty
miles
in
the
interior
englehart
was
a
gold
miner
an
ardent
revolutionist
and
good
people
that
he
was
a
man
of
resource
and
imagination
was
proven
by
the
telegram
he
had
sent
it
had
been
his
task
to
send
a
confidential
message
to
his
friend
in
coralio
this
could
not
have
been
accomplished
in
either
spanish
or
english
for
the
eye
politic
in
anchuria
was
an
active
one
the
ins
and
the
outs
were
perpetually
on
their
guard
but
englehart
was
a
diplomatist
there
existed
but
one
code
upon
which
he
might
make
requisition
with
promise
of
safety
the
great
and
potent
code
of
slang
so
here
is
the
message
that
slipped
unconstrued
through
the
fingers
of
curious
officials
and
came
to
the
eye
of
goodwin
his
nibs
skedaddled
yesterday
per
line
with
all
the
coin
in
the
kitty
and
the
bundle
of
muslin
he
spoony
about
the
boodle
is
six
figures
short
our
crowd
in
good
shape
but
we
need
the
spondulicks
you
collar
it
the
main
guy
and
the
dry
goods
are
headed
for
the
briny
you
know
what
to
do
bob
this
screed
remarkable
as
it
was
had
no
mystery
for
goodwin
he
was
the
most
successful
of
the
small
of
speculative
americans
that
had
invaded
anchuria
and
he
had
not
reached
that
enviable
pinnacle
without
having
well
exercised
the
arts
of
foresight
and
deduction
he
had
taken
up
political
intrigue
as
a
matter
of
business
he
was
acute
enough
to
wield
a
certain
influence
among
the
leading
schemers
and
he
was
prosperous
enough
to
be
able
to
purchase
the
respect
of
the
petty
there
was
always
a
revolutionary
party
and
to
it
he
had
always
allied
himself
for
the
adherents
of
a
new
administration
received
the
rewards
of
their
labours
there
was
now
a
liberal
party
seeking
to
overturn
president
miraflores
if
the
wheel
successfully
revolved
goodwin
stood
to
win
a
concession
to
manzanas
of
the
finest
coffee
lands
in
the
interior
certain
incidents
in
the
recent
career
of
president
miraflores
had
excited
a
shrewd
suspicion
in
goodwin
mind
that
the
government
was
near
a
dissolution
from
another
cause
than
that
of
a
revolution
and
now
englehart
telegram
had
come
as
a
corroboration
of
his
wisdom
the
telegram
which
had
remained
unintelligible
to
the
anchurian
linguists
who
had
applied
to
it
in
vain
their
knowledge
of
spanish
and
elemental
english
conveyed
a
stimulating
piece
of
news
to
goodwin
understanding
it
informed
him
that
the
president
of
the
republic
had
decamped
from
the
capital
city
with
the
contents
of
the
treasury
furthermore
that
he
was
accompanied
in
his
flight
by
that
winning
adventuress
isabel
guilbert
the
opera
singer
whose
troupe
of
performers
had
been
entertained
by
the
president
at
san
mateo
during
the
past
month
on
a
scale
less
modest
than
that
with
which
royal
visitors
are
often
content
the
reference
to
the
line
could
mean
nothing
else
than
the
system
of
transport
that
prevailed
between
coralio
and
the
capital
the
hint
that
the
boodle
was
six
figures
short
made
the
condition
of
the
national
treasury
lamentably
clear
also
it
was
convincingly
true
that
the
ingoing
party
its
way
now
made
a
pacific
one
would
need
the
spondulicks
unless
its
pledges
should
be
fulfilled
and
the
spoils
held
for
the
delectation
of
the
victors
precarious
indeed
would
be
the
position
of
the
new
government
therefore
it
was
exceeding
necessary
to
collar
the
main
guy
and
recapture
the
sinews
of
war
and
government
goodwin
handed
the
message
to
keogh
read
that
billy
he
said
it
from
bob
englehart
can
you
manage
the
cipher
keogh
sat
in
the
other
half
of
the
doorway
and
carefully
perused
the
telegram
is
not
a
cipher
he
said
finally
is
what
they
call
literature
and
that
a
system
of
language
put
in
the
mouths
of
people
that
they
never
been
introduced
to
by
writers
of
imagination
the
magazines
invented
it
but
i
never
knew
before
that
president
norvin
green
had
stamped
it
with
the
seal
of
his
approval
is
now
no
longer
literature
but
language
the
dictionaries
tried
but
they
could
make
it
go
for
anything
but
dialect
sure
now
that
the
western
union
indorses
it
it
wo
be
long
till
a
race
of
people
will
spring
up
that
speaks
it
you
running
too
much
to
philology
billy
said
goodwin
do
you
make
out
the
meaning
of
it
sure
replied
the
philosopher
of
fortune
all
languages
come
easy
to
the
man
who
must
know
i
even
failed
to
misunderstand
an
order
to
evacuate
in
classical
chinese
when
it
was
backed
up
by
the
muzzle
of
a
this
little
literary
essay
i
hold
in
my
hands
means
a
game
of
ever
play
that
frank
when
you
was
a
kid
i
think
so
said
goodwin
laughing
you
join
hands
all
and
you
do
not
interrupted
keogh
you
got
a
fine
sporting
game
mixed
up
in
your
head
with
around
the
rosebush
the
spirit
of
is
opposed
to
the
holding
of
hands
i
tell
you
how
it
played
this
president
man
and
his
companion
in
play
they
stand
up
over
in
san
mateo
ready
for
the
run
and
shout
me
and
you
standing
here
we
say
and
the
gander
they
say
many
miles
is
it
to
london
town
we
say
a
few
if
your
legs
are
long
enough
how
many
comes
out
they
say
than
you
able
to
catch
and
then
the
game
commences
i
catch
the
idea
said
goodwin
it
wo
do
to
let
the
goose
and
gander
slip
through
our
fingers
billy
their
feathers
are
too
valuable
our
crowd
is
prepared
and
able
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
government
at
once
but
with
the
treasury
empty
we
stay
in
power
about
as
long
as
a
tenderfoot
would
stick
on
an
untamed
bronco
we
must
play
the
fox
on
every
foot
of
the
coast
to
prevent
their
getting
out
of
the
country
by
the
schedule
said
keogh
it
five
days
down
from
san
mateo
we
got
plenty
of
time
to
set
our
outposts
there
only
three
places
on
the
coast
where
they
can
hope
to
sail
from
here
and
solitas
and
alazan
they
the
only
points
we
have
to
guard
as
easy
as
a
chess
problem
fox
to
play
and
mate
in
three
moves
oh
goosey
goosey
gander
whither
do
you
wander
by
the
blessing
of
the
literary
telegraph
the
boodle
of
this
benighted
fatherland
shall
be
preserved
to
the
honest
political
party
that
is
seeking
to
overthrow
it
the
situation
had
been
justly
outlined
by
keogh
the
down
trail
from
the
capital
was
at
all
times
a
weary
road
to
travel
a
journey
it
was
and
hot
wet
and
dry
the
trail
climbed
appalling
mountains
wound
like
a
rotten
string
about
the
brows
of
breathless
precipices
plunged
through
chilling
streams
and
wriggled
like
a
snake
through
sunless
forests
teeming
with
menacing
insect
and
animal
life
after
descending
to
the
foothills
it
turned
to
a
trident
the
central
prong
ending
at
alazan
another
branched
off
to
coralio
the
third
penetrated
to
solitas
between
the
sea
and
the
foothills
stretched
the
five
miles
breadth
of
alluvial
coast
here
was
the
flora
of
the
tropics
in
its
rankest
and
most
prodigal
growth
spaces
here
and
there
had
been
wrested
from
the
jungle
and
planted
with
bananas
and
cane
and
orange
groves
the
rest
was
a
riot
of
wild
vegetation
the
home
of
monkeys
tapirs
jaguars
alligators
and
prodigious
reptiles
and
insects
where
no
road
was
cut
a
serpent
could
scarcely
make
its
way
through
the
tangle
of
vines
and
creepers
across
the
treacherous
mangrove
swamps
few
things
without
wings
could
safely
pass
therefore
the
fugitives
could
hope
to
reach
the
coast
only
by
one
of
the
routes
named
keep
the
matter
quiet
billy
advised
goodwin
we
do
want
the
ins
to
know
that
the
president
is
in
flight
i
suppose
information
is
something
of
a
scoop
in
the
capital
as
yet
otherwise
he
would
not
have
tried
to
make
his
message
a
confidential
one
and
besides
everybody
would
have
heard
the
news
i
going
around
now
to
see
zavalla
and
start
a
man
up
the
trail
to
cut
the
telegraph
wire
as
goodwin
rose
keogh
threw
his
hat
upon
the
grass
by
the
door
and
expelled
a
tremendous
sigh
what
the
trouble
billy
asked
goodwin
pausing
that
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
you
sigh
is
the
last
said
keogh
with
that
sorrowful
puff
of
wind
i
resign
myself
to
a
life
of
praiseworthy
but
harassing
honesty
what
are
tintypes
if
you
please
to
the
opportunities
of
the
great
and
hilarious
class
of
ganders
and
geese
not
that
i
would
be
a
president
frank
and
the
boodle
he
got
is
too
big
for
me
to
handle
but
in
some
ways
i
feel
my
conscience
hurting
me
for
addicting
myself
to
photographing
a
nation
instead
of
running
away
with
it
frank
did
you
ever
see
the
of
muslin
that
his
excellency
has
wrapped
up
and
carried
off
isabel
guilbert
said
goodwin
laughing
no
i
never
did
from
what
i
heard
of
her
though
i
imagine
that
she
would
stick
at
anything
to
carry
her
point
do
get
romantic
billy
sometimes
i
begin
to
fear
that
there
irish
blood
in
your
ancestry
i
never
saw
her
either
went
on
keogh
but
they
say
she
got
all
the
ladies
of
mythology
sculpture
and
fiction
reduced
to
chromos
they
say
she
can
look
at
a
man
once
and
he
turn
monkey
and
climb
trees
to
pick
cocoanuts
for
her
think
of
that
president
man
with
lord
knows
how
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
one
hand
and
this
muslin
siren
in
the
other
galloping
down
hill
on
a
sympathetic
mule
amid
songbirds
and
flowers
and
here
is
billy
keogh
because
he
is
virtuous
condemned
to
the
unprofitable
swindle
of
slandering
the
faces
of
missing
links
on
tin
for
an
honest
living
is
an
injustice
of
nature
cheer
up
said
goodwin
you
are
a
pretty
poor
fox
to
be
envying
a
gander
maybe
the
enchanting
guilbert
will
take
a
fancy
to
you
and
your
tintypes
after
we
impoverish
her
royal
escort
she
could
do
worse
reflected
keogh
but
she
wo
is
not
a
tintype
gallery
but
the
gallery
of
the
gods
that
she
fitted
to
adorn
she
a
very
wicked
lady
and
the
president
man
is
in
luck
but
i
hear
clancy
swearing
in
the
back
room
for
having
to
do
all
the
work
and
keogh
plunged
for
the
rear
of
the
gallery
whistling
gaily
in
a
spontaneous
way
that
belied
his
recent
sigh
over
the
questionable
good
luck
of
the
flying
president
goodwin
turned
from
the
main
street
into
a
much
narrower
one
that
intersected
it
at
a
right
angle
these
side
streets
were
covered
by
a
growth
of
thick
rank
grass
which
was
kept
to
a
navigable
shortness
by
the
machetes
of
the
police
stone
sidewalks
little
more
than
a
ledge
in
width
ran
along
the
base
of
the
mean
and
monotonous
adobe
houses
at
the
outskirts
of
the
village
these
streets
dwindled
to
nothing
and
here
were
set
the
huts
of
the
caribs
and
the
poorer
natives
and
the
shabby
cabins
of
negroes
from
jamaica
and
the
west
india
islands
a
few
structures
raised
their
heads
above
the
roofs
of
the
houses
the
bell
tower
of
the
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
the
residence
of
the
vesuvius
fruit
company
agent
the
store
and
residence
of
bernard
brannigan
a
ruined
cathedral
in
which
columbus
had
once
set
foot
and
most
imposing
of
all
the
casa
morena
the
summer
white
house
of
the
president
of
anchuria
on
the
principal
street
running
along
the
beach
the
broadway
of
coralio
were
the
larger
stores
the
government
and
the
the
and
the
market
place
on
his
way
goodwin
passed
the
house
of
bernard
brannigan
it
was
a
modern
wooden
building
two
stories
in
height
the
ground
floor
was
occupied
by
brannigan
store
the
upper
one
contained
the
living
apartments
a
wide
cool
porch
ran
around
the
house
half
way
up
its
outer
walls
a
handsome
vivacious
girl
neatly
dressed
in
flowing
white
leaned
over
the
railing
and
smiled
down
upon
goodwin
she
was
no
darker
than
many
an
andalusian
of
high
descent
and
she
sparkled
and
glowed
like
a
tropical
moonlight
good
evening
miss
paula
said
goodwin
taking
off
his
hat
with
his
ready
smile
there
was
little
difference
in
his
manner
whether
he
addressed
women
or
men
everybody
in
coralio
liked
to
receive
the
salutation
of
the
big
american
is
there
any
news
goodwin
please
do
say
no
is
it
warm
i
feel
just
like
mariana
in
her
moated
grange
or
was
it
a
range
it
hot
enough
no
there
no
news
to
tell
i
believe
said
goodwin
with
a
mischievous
look
in
his
eye
except
that
old
geddie
is
getting
grumpier
and
crosser
every
day
if
something
does
happen
to
relieve
his
mind
i
have
to
quit
smoking
on
his
back
porch
and
there
no
other
place
available
that
is
cool
enough
he
is
grumpy
said
paula
brannigan
impulsively
when
he
but
she
ceased
suddenly
and
drew
back
with
a
deepening
colour
for
her
mother
had
been
a
lady
and
the
spanish
blood
had
brought
to
paula
a
certain
shyness
that
was
an
adornment
to
the
other
half
of
her
demonstrative
nature
ii
the
lotus
and
the
bottle
willard
geddie
consul
for
the
united
states
in
coralio
was
working
leisurely
on
his
yearly
report
goodwin
who
had
strolled
in
as
he
did
daily
for
a
smoke
on
the
much
coveted
porch
had
found
him
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
departed
after
roundly
abusing
the
consul
for
his
lack
of
hospitality
i
shall
complain
to
the
civil
service
department
said
goodwin
or
is
it
a
department
perhaps
it
only
a
theory
one
gets
neither
civility
nor
service
from
you
you
wo
talk
and
you
wo
set
out
anything
to
drink
what
kind
of
a
way
is
that
of
representing
your
government
goodwin
strolled
out
and
across
to
the
hotel
to
see
if
he
could
bully
the
quarantine
doctor
into
a
game
on
coralio
solitary
billiard
table
his
plans
were
completed
for
the
interception
of
the
fugitives
from
the
capital
and
now
it
was
but
a
waiting
game
that
he
had
to
play
the
consul
was
interested
in
his
report
he
was
only
and
he
had
not
been
in
coralio
long
enough
for
his
enthusiasm
to
cool
in
the
heat
of
the
tropics
a
paradox
that
may
be
allowed
between
cancer
and
capricorn
so
many
thousand
bunches
of
bananas
so
many
thousand
oranges
and
cocoanuts
so
many
ounces
of
gold
dust
pounds
of
rubber
coffee
indigo
and
sarsaparilla
actually
exports
were
twenty
per
cent
greater
than
for
the
previous
year
a
little
thrill
of
satisfaction
ran
through
the
consul
perhaps
he
thought
the
state
department
upon
reading
his
introduction
would
notice
and
then
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
he
was
getting
as
bad
as
the
others
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
that
coralio
was
an
insignificant
town
in
an
insignificant
republic
lying
along
the
of
a
sea
he
thought
of
gregg
the
quarantine
doctor
who
subscribed
for
the
london
expecting
to
find
it
quoting
his
reports
to
the
home
board
of
health
concerning
the
yellow
fever
germ
the
consul
knew
that
not
one
in
fifty
of
his
acquaintances
in
the
states
had
ever
heard
of
coralio
he
knew
that
two
men
at
any
rate
would
have
to
read
his
report
some
underling
in
the
state
department
and
a
compositor
in
the
public
printing
office
perhaps
the
typesticker
would
note
the
increase
of
commerce
in
coralio
and
speak
of
it
over
the
cheese
and
beer
to
a
friend
he
had
just
written
most
unaccountable
is
the
supineness
of
the
large
exporters
in
the
united
states
in
permitting
the
french
and
german
houses
to
practically
control
the
trade
interests
of
this
rich
and
productive
country
when
he
heard
the
hoarse
notes
of
a
steamer
siren
geddie
laid
down
his
pen
and
gathered
his
panama
hat
and
umbrella
by
the
sound
he
knew
it
to
be
the
one
of
the
line
of
fruit
vessels
plying
for
the
vesuvius
company
down
to
of
five
years
everyone
in
coralio
could
name
you
each
incoming
steamer
by
the
note
of
her
siren
the
consul
sauntered
by
a
roundabout
shaded
way
to
the
beach
by
reason
of
long
practice
he
gauged
his
stroll
so
accurately
that
by
the
time
he
arrived
on
the
sandy
shore
the
boat
of
the
customs
officials
was
rowing
back
from
the
steamer
which
had
been
boarded
and
inspected
according
to
the
laws
of
anchuria
there
is
no
harbour
at
coralio
vessels
of
the
draught
of
the
must
ride
at
anchor
a
mile
from
shore
when
they
take
on
fruit
it
is
conveyed
on
lighters
and
freighter
sloops
at
solitas
where
there
was
a
fine
harbour
ships
of
many
kinds
were
to
be
seen
but
in
the
roadstead
off
coralio
scarcely
any
save
the
fruiters
paused
now
and
then
a
tramp
coaster
or
a
mysterious
brig
from
spain
or
a
saucy
french
barque
would
hang
innocently
for
a
few
days
in
the
offing
then
the
crew
would
become
doubly
vigilant
and
wary
at
night
a
sloop
or
two
would
be
making
strange
trips
in
and
out
along
the
shore
and
in
the
morning
the
stock
of
hennessey
wines
and
drygoods
in
coralio
would
be
found
vastly
increased
it
has
also
been
said
that
the
customs
officials
jingled
more
silver
in
the
pockets
of
their
trousers
and
that
the
record
books
showed
no
increase
in
import
duties
received
the
customs
boat
and
the
gig
reached
the
shore
at
the
same
time
when
they
grounded
in
the
shallow
water
there
was
still
five
yards
of
rolling
surf
between
them
and
dry
sand
then
caribs
dashed
into
the
water
and
brought
in
on
their
backs
the
purser
and
the
little
native
officials
in
their
cotton
undershirts
blue
trousers
with
red
stripes
and
flapping
straw
hats
at
college
geddie
had
been
a
treasure
as
a
he
now
closed
his
umbrella
stuck
it
upright
in
the
sand
and
stooped
with
his
hands
resting
upon
his
knees
the
purser
burlesquing
the
pitcher
contortions
hurled
at
the
consul
the
heavy
roll
of
newspapers
tied
with
a
string
that
the
steamer
always
brought
for
him
geddie
leaped
high
and
caught
the
roll
with
a
sounding
thwack
the
loungers
on
the
beach
about
a
third
of
the
population
of
the
town
laughed
and
applauded
delightedly
every
week
they
expected
to
see
that
roll
of
papers
delivered
and
received
in
that
same
manner
and
they
were
never
disappointed
innovations
did
not
flourish
in
coralio
the
consul
his
umbrella
and
walked
back
to
the
consulate
this
home
of
a
great
nation
representative
was
a
wooden
structure
of
two
rooms
with
a
gallery
of
poles
bamboo
and
nipa
palm
running
on
three
sides
of
it
one
room
was
the
official
apartment
furnished
chastely
with
a
desk
a
hammock
and
three
uncomfortable
chairs
engravings
of
the
first
and
latest
president
of
the
country
represented
hung
against
the
wall
the
other
room
was
the
consul
living
apartment
it
was
eleven
when
he
returned
from
the
beach
and
therefore
breakfast
time
chanca
the
carib
woman
who
cooked
for
him
was
just
serving
the
meal
on
the
side
of
the
gallery
facing
the
sea
a
spot
famous
as
the
coolest
in
coralio
the
breakfast
consisted
of
fin
soup
stew
of
land
crabs
breadfruit
a
boiled
iguana
steak
aguacates
a
freshly
cut
pineapple
claret
and
coffee
geddie
took
his
seat
and
unrolled
with
luxurious
laziness
his
bundle
of
newspapers
here
in
coralio
for
two
days
or
longer
he
would
read
of
in
the
world
very
much
as
we
of
the
world
read
those
whimsical
contributions
to
inexact
science
that
assume
to
portray
the
doings
of
the
martians
after
he
had
finished
with
the
papers
they
would
be
sent
on
the
rounds
of
the
other
residents
of
the
town
the
paper
that
came
first
to
his
hand
was
one
of
those
bulky
mattresses
of
printed
stuff
upon
which
the
readers
of
certain
new
york
journals
are
supposed
to
take
their
sabbath
literary
nap
opening
this
the
consul
rested
it
upon
the
table
supporting
its
weight
with
the
aid
of
the
back
of
a
chair
then
he
partook
of
his
meal
deliberately
turning
the
leaves
from
time
to
time
and
glancing
half
idly
at
the
contents
presently
he
was
struck
by
something
familiar
to
him
in
a
picture
a
badly
printed
reproduction
of
a
photograph
of
a
vessel
languidly
interested
he
leaned
for
a
nearer
scrutiny
and
a
view
of
the
florid
headlines
of
the
column
next
to
the
picture
yes
he
was
not
mistaken
the
engraving
was
of
the
yacht
belonging
to
that
prince
of
good
fellows
midas
of
the
money
market
and
society
pink
of
perfection
j
ward
tolliver
slowly
sipping
his
black
coffee
geddie
read
the
column
of
print
following
a
listed
statement
of
tolliver
real
estate
and
bonds
came
a
description
of
the
yacht
furnishings
and
then
the
grain
of
news
no
bigger
than
a
mustard
seed
tolliver
with
a
party
of
favoured
guests
would
sail
the
next
day
on
a
six
weeks
cruise
along
the
central
american
and
south
american
coasts
and
among
the
bahama
islands
among
the
guests
were
cumberland
payne
and
miss
ida
payne
of
norfolk
the
writer
with
the
fatuous
presumption
that
was
demanded
of
him
by
his
readers
had
concocted
a
romance
suited
to
their
palates
he
bracketed
the
names
of
miss
payne
and
tolliver
until
he
had
read
the
marriage
ceremony
over
them
he
played
coyly
and
insinuatingly
upon
the
strings
of
and
madame
rumour
and
a
little
bird
and
no
one
would
be
surprised
and
ended
with
congratulations
geddie
having
finished
his
breakfast
took
his
papers
to
the
edge
of
the
gallery
and
sat
there
in
his
favourite
steamer
chair
with
his
feet
on
the
bamboo
railing
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
looked
out
upon
the
sea
he
felt
a
glow
of
satisfaction
at
finding
he
was
so
little
disturbed
by
what
he
had
read
he
told
himself
that
he
had
conquered
the
distress
that
had
sent
him
a
voluntary
exile
to
this
far
land
of
the
lotus
he
could
never
forget
ida
of
course
but
there
was
no
longer
any
pain
in
thinking
about
her
when
they
had
had
that
misunderstanding
and
quarrel
he
had
impulsively
sought
this
consulship
with
the
desire
to
retaliate
upon
her
by
detaching
himself
from
her
world
and
presence
he
had
succeeded
thoroughly
in
that
during
the
twelve
months
of
his
life
in
coralio
no
word
had
passed
between
them
though
he
had
sometimes
heard
of
her
through
the
dilatory
correspondence
with
the
few
friends
to
whom
he
still
wrote
still
he
could
not
repress
a
little
thrill
of
satisfaction
at
knowing
that
she
had
not
yet
married
tolliver
or
anyone
else
but
evidently
tolliver
had
not
yet
abandoned
hope
well
it
made
no
difference
to
him
now
he
had
eaten
of
the
lotus
he
was
happy
and
content
in
this
land
of
perpetual
afternoon
those
old
days
of
life
in
the
states
seemed
like
an
irritating
dream
he
hoped
ida
would
be
as
happy
as
he
was
the
climate
as
balmy
as
that
of
distant
avalon
the
fetterless
idyllic
round
of
enchanted
days
the
life
among
this
indolent
romantic
people
a
life
full
of
music
flowers
and
low
laughter
the
influence
of
the
imminent
sea
and
mountains
and
the
many
shapes
of
love
and
magic
and
beauty
that
bloomed
in
the
white
tropic
nights
with
all
he
was
more
than
content
also
there
was
paula
brannigan
geddie
intended
to
marry
paula
if
of
course
she
would
consent
but
he
felt
rather
sure
that
she
would
do
that
somehow
he
kept
postponing
his
proposal
several
times
he
had
been
quite
near
to
it
but
a
mysterious
something
always
held
him
back
perhaps
it
was
only
the
unconscious
instinctive
conviction
that
the
act
would
sever
the
last
tie
that
bound
him
to
his
old
world
he
could
be
very
happy
with
paula
few
of
the
native
girls
could
be
compared
with
her
she
had
attended
a
convent
school
in
new
orleans
for
two
years
and
when
she
chose
to
display
her
accomplishments
no
one
could
detect
any
difference
between
her
and
the
girls
of
norfolk
and
manhattan
but
it
was
delicious
to
see
her
at
home
dressed
as
she
sometimes
was
in
the
native
costume
with
bare
shoulders
and
flowing
sleeves
bernard
brannigan
was
the
great
merchant
of
coralio
besides
his
store
he
maintained
a
train
of
pack
mules
and
carried
on
a
lively
trade
with
the
interior
towns
and
villages
he
had
married
a
native
lady
of
high
castilian
descent
but
with
a
tinge
of
indian
brown
showing
through
her
olive
cheek
the
union
of
the
irish
and
the
spanish
had
produced
as
it
so
often
has
an
offshoot
of
rare
beauty
and
variety
they
were
very
excellent
people
indeed
and
the
upper
story
of
their
house
was
ready
to
be
placed
at
the
service
of
geddie
and
paula
as
soon
as
he
should
make
up
his
mind
to
speak
about
it
by
the
time
two
hours
were
whiled
away
the
consul
tired
of
reading
the
papers
lay
scattered
about
him
on
the
gallery
reclining
there
he
gazed
dreamily
out
upon
an
eden
a
clump
of
banana
plants
interposed
their
broad
shields
between
him
and
the
sun
the
gentle
slope
from
the
consulate
to
the
sea
was
covered
with
the
foliage
of
and
just
bursting
into
bloom
a
lagoon
pierced
the
land
like
a
dark
jagged
crystal
and
above
it
a
pale
rose
almost
to
the
clouds
the
waving
cocoanut
palms
on
the
beach
flared
their
decorative
green
leaves
against
the
slate
of
an
almost
quiescent
sea
his
senses
were
cognizant
of
brilliant
scarlet
and
ochres
amid
the
vert
of
the
coppice
of
odours
of
fruit
and
bloom
and
the
smoke
from
chanca
clay
oven
under
the
of
the
treble
laughter
of
the
native
women
in
their
huts
the
song
of
the
robin
the
salt
taste
of
the
breeze
the
diminuendo
of
the
faint
surf
running
along
the
shore
and
gradually
of
a
white
speck
growing
to
a
blur
that
intruded
itself
upon
the
drab
prospect
of
the
sea
lazily
interested
he
watched
this
blur
increase
until
it
became
the
steaming
at
full
speed
coming
down
the
coast
without
changing
his
position
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
beautiful
white
yacht
as
she
drew
swiftly
near
and
came
opposite
to
coralio
then
sitting
upright
he
saw
her
float
steadily
past
and
on
scarcely
a
mile
of
sea
had
separated
her
from
the
shore
he
had
seen
the
frequent
flash
of
her
polished
brass
work
and
the
stripes
of
her
so
much
and
no
more
like
a
ship
on
a
magic
lantern
slide
the
had
crossed
the
illuminated
circle
of
the
consul
little
world
and
was
gone
save
for
the
tiny
cloud
of
smoke
that
was
left
hanging
over
the
brim
of
the
sea
she
might
have
been
an
immaterial
thing
a
chimera
of
his
idle
brain
geddie
went
into
his
office
and
sat
down
to
dawdle
over
his
report
if
the
reading
of
the
article
in
the
paper
had
left
him
unshaken
this
silent
passing
of
the
had
done
for
him
still
more
it
had
brought
the
calm
and
peace
of
a
situation
from
which
all
uncertainty
had
been
erased
he
knew
that
men
sometimes
hope
without
being
aware
of
it
now
since
she
had
come
two
thousand
miles
and
had
passed
without
a
sign
not
even
his
unconscious
self
need
cling
to
the
past
any
longer
after
dinner
when
the
sun
was
low
behind
the
mountains
geddie
walked
on
the
little
strip
of
beach
under
the
cocoanuts
the
wind
was
blowing
mildly
landward
and
the
surface
of
the
sea
was
rippled
by
tiny
wavelets
a
miniature
breaker
spreading
with
a
soft
swish
upon
the
sand
brought
with
it
something
round
and
shiny
that
rolled
back
again
as
the
wave
receded
the
next
influx
beached
it
clear
and
geddie
picked
it
up
the
thing
was
a
wine
bottle
of
colourless
glass
the
cork
had
been
driven
in
tightly
to
the
level
of
the
mouth
and
the
end
covered
with
the
bottle
contained
only
what
seemed
to
be
a
sheet
of
paper
much
curled
from
the
manipulation
it
had
undergone
while
being
inserted
in
the
was
the
impression
of
a
seal
probably
of
a
bearing
the
initials
of
a
monogram
but
the
impression
had
been
hastily
made
and
the
letters
were
past
anything
more
certain
than
a
shrewd
conjecture
ida
payne
had
always
worn
a
in
preference
to
any
other
finger
decoration
geddie
thought
he
could
make
out
the
familiar
i
p
and
a
queer
sensation
of
disquietude
went
over
him
more
personal
and
intimate
was
this
reminder
of
her
than
had
been
the
sight
of
the
vessel
she
was
doubtless
on
he
walked
back
to
his
house
and
set
the
bottle
on
his
desk
throwing
off
his
hat
and
coat
and
lighting
a
lamp
for
the
night
had
crowded
precipitately
upon
the
brief
twilight
he
began
to
examine
his
piece
of
sea
salvage
by
holding
the
bottle
near
the
light
and
turning
it
judiciously
he
made
out
that
it
contained
a
double
sheet
of
filled
with
close
writing
further
that
the
paper
was
of
the
same
size
and
shade
as
that
always
used
by
ida
and
that
to
the
best
of
his
belief
the
handwriting
was
hers
the
imperfect
glass
of
the
bottle
so
distorted
the
rays
of
light
that
he
could
read
no
word
of
the
writing
but
certain
capital
letters
of
which
he
caught
comprehensive
glimpses
were
ida
he
felt
sure
there
was
a
little
smile
both
of
perplexity
and
amusement
in
eyes
as
he
set
the
bottle
down
and
laid
three
cigars
side
by
side
on
his
desk
he
fetched
his
steamer
chair
from
the
gallery
and
stretched
himself
comfortably
he
would
smoke
those
three
cigars
while
considering
the
problem
for
it
amounted
to
a
problem
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
not
found
the
bottle
but
the
bottle
was
there
why
should
it
have
drifted
in
from
the
sea
whence
come
so
many
disquieting
things
to
disturb
his
peace
in
this
dreamy
land
where
time
seemed
so
redundant
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
bestowing
much
thought
upon
even
trifling
matters
he
began
to
speculate
upon
many
fanciful
theories
concerning
the
story
of
the
bottle
rejecting
each
in
turn
ships
in
danger
of
wreck
or
disablement
sometimes
cast
forth
such
precarious
messengers
calling
for
aid
but
he
had
seen
the
not
three
hours
before
safe
and
speeding
suppose
the
crew
had
mutinied
and
imprisoned
the
passengers
below
and
the
message
was
one
begging
for
succour
but
premising
such
an
improbable
outrage
would
the
agitated
captives
have
taken
the
pains
to
fill
four
pages
of
with
carefully
penned
arguments
to
their
rescue
thus
by
elimination
he
soon
rid
the
matter
of
the
more
unlikely
theories
and
was
reduced
though
aversely
to
the
less
assailable
one
that
the
bottle
contained
a
message
to
himself
ida
knew
he
was
in
coralio
she
must
have
launched
the
bottle
while
the
yacht
was
passing
and
the
wind
blowing
fairly
toward
the
shore
as
soon
as
geddie
reached
this
conclusion
a
wrinkle
came
between
his
brows
and
a
stubborn
look
settled
around
his
mouth
he
sat
looking
out
through
the
doorway
at
the
gigantic
traversing
the
quiet
streets
if
this
was
a
message
to
him
from
ida
what
could
it
mean
save
an
overture
toward
a
reconciliation
and
if
that
why
had
she
not
used
the
same
methods
of
the
post
instead
of
this
uncertain
and
even
flippant
means
of
communication
a
note
in
an
empty
bottle
cast
into
the
sea
there
was
something
light
and
frivolous
about
it
if
not
actually
contemptuous
the
thought
stirred
his
pride
and
subdued
whatever
emotions
had
been
resurrected
by
the
finding
of
the
bottle
geddie
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
walked
out
he
followed
a
street
that
led
him
along
the
border
of
the
little
plaza
where
a
band
was
playing
and
people
were
rambling
and
indolent
some
timorous
scurrying
past
with
tangled
in
the
jetty
braids
of
their
hair
glanced
at
him
with
shy
flattering
eyes
the
air
was
languorous
with
the
scent
of
jasmin
and
the
consul
stayed
his
steps
at
the
house
of
bernard
brannigan
paula
was
swinging
in
a
hammock
on
the
gallery
she
rose
from
it
like
a
bird
from
its
nest
the
colour
came
to
her
cheek
at
the
sound
of
geddie
voice
he
was
charmed
at
the
sight
of
her
costume
a
flounced
muslin
dress
with
a
little
jacket
of
white
flannel
all
made
with
neatness
and
style
he
suggested
a
stroll
and
they
walked
out
to
the
old
indian
well
on
the
hill
road
they
sat
on
the
curb
and
there
geddie
made
the
expected
but
speech
certain
though
he
had
been
that
she
would
not
say
him
nay
he
was
thrilled
with
joy
at
the
completeness
and
sweetness
of
her
surrender
here
was
surely
a
heart
made
for
love
and
steadfastness
here
was
no
caprice
or
questionings
or
captious
standards
of
convention
when
geddie
kissed
paula
at
her
door
that
night
he
was
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
before
here
in
this
hollow
lotus
land
ever
to
live
and
lie
reclined
seemed
to
him
as
it
has
seemed
to
many
mariners
the
best
as
well
as
the
easiest
his
future
would
be
an
ideal
one
he
had
attained
a
paradise
without
a
serpent
his
eve
would
be
indeed
a
part
of
him
unbeguiled
and
therefore
more
beguiling
he
had
made
his
decision
and
his
heart
was
full
of
serene
assured
content
geddie
went
back
to
his
house
whistling
that
finest
and
saddest
love
song
la
golondrina
at
the
door
his
tame
monkey
leaped
down
from
his
shelf
chattering
briskly
the
consul
turned
to
his
desk
to
get
him
some
nuts
he
usually
kept
there
reaching
in
the
his
hand
struck
against
the
bottle
he
started
as
if
he
had
touched
the
cold
rotundity
of
a
serpent
he
had
forgotten
that
the
bottle
was
there
he
lighted
the
lamp
and
fed
the
monkey
then
very
deliberately
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
took
the
bottle
in
his
hand
and
walked
down
the
path
to
the
beach
there
was
a
moon
and
the
sea
was
glorious
the
breeze
had
shifted
as
it
did
each
evening
and
was
now
rushing
steadily
seaward
stepping
to
the
water
edge
geddie
hurled
the
unopened
bottle
far
out
into
the
sea
it
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
then
shot
upward
twice
its
length
geddie
stood
still
watching
it
the
moonlight
was
so
bright
that
he
could
see
it
bobbing
up
and
down
with
the
little
waves
slowly
it
receded
from
the
shore
flashing
and
turning
as
it
went
the
wind
was
carrying
it
out
to
sea
soon
it
became
a
mere
speck
doubtfully
discerned
at
irregular
intervals
and
then
the
mystery
of
it
was
swallowed
up
by
the
greater
mystery
of
the
ocean
geddie
stood
still
upon
the
beach
smoking
and
looking
out
upon
the
water
simon
oh
simon
wake
up
there
simon
bawled
a
sonorous
voice
at
the
edge
of
the
water
old
simon
cruz
was
a
fisherman
and
smuggler
who
lived
in
a
hut
on
the
beach
out
of
his
earliest
nap
simon
was
thus
awakened
he
slipped
on
his
shoes
and
went
outside
just
landing
from
one
of
the
boats
was
the
third
mate
of
that
vessel
who
was
an
acquaintance
of
simon
and
three
sailors
from
the
fruiter
go
up
simon
called
the
mate
and
find
gregg
or
goodwin
or
anybody
that
a
friend
to
geddie
and
bring
here
at
once
saints
of
the
skies
said
simon
sleepily
nothing
has
happened
to
mr
geddie
he
under
that
tarpauling
said
the
mate
pointing
to
the
boat
and
he
rather
more
than
half
drownded
we
seen
him
from
the
steamer
nearly
a
mile
out
from
shore
swimmin
like
mad
after
a
bottle
that
was
floatin
in
the
water
outward
bound
we
lowered
the
gig
and
started
for
him
he
nearly
had
his
hand
on
the
bottle
when
he
gave
out
and
went
under
we
pulled
him
out
in
time
to
save
him
maybe
but
the
doctor
is
the
one
to
decide
that
a
bottle
said
the
old
man
rubbing
his
eyes
he
was
not
yet
fully
awake
where
is
the
bottle
driftin
along
out
there
said
the
mate
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
sea
get
on
with
you
simon
iii
smith
goodwin
and
the
ardent
patriot
zavalla
took
all
the
precautions
that
their
foresight
could
contrive
to
prevent
the
escape
of
president
miraflores
and
his
companion
they
sent
trusted
messengers
up
the
coast
to
solitas
and
alazan
to
warn
the
local
leaders
of
the
flight
and
to
instruct
them
to
patrol
the
water
line
and
arrest
the
fugitives
at
all
hazards
should
they
reveal
themselves
in
that
territory
after
this
was
done
there
remained
only
to
cover
the
district
about
coralio
and
await
the
coming
of
the
quarry
the
nets
were
well
spread
the
roads
were
so
few
the
opportunities
for
embarkation
so
limited
and
the
two
or
three
probable
points
of
exit
so
well
guarded
that
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
there
should
slip
through
the
meshes
so
much
of
the
country
dignity
romance
and
collateral
the
president
would
without
doubt
move
as
secretly
as
possible
and
endeavour
to
board
a
vessel
by
stealth
from
some
secluded
point
along
the
shore
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
receipt
of
englehart
telegram
the
a
norwegian
steamer
chartered
by
the
new
orleans
fruit
trade
anchored
off
coralio
with
three
hoarse
toots
of
her
siren
the
was
not
one
of
the
line
operated
by
the
vesuvius
fruit
company
she
was
something
of
a
dilettante
doing
odd
jobs
for
a
company
that
was
scarcely
important
enough
to
figure
as
a
rival
to
the
vesuvius
the
movements
of
the
were
dependent
upon
the
state
of
the
market
sometimes
she
would
ply
steadily
between
the
spanish
main
and
new
orleans
in
the
regular
transport
of
fruit
next
she
would
be
making
erratic
trips
to
mobile
or
charleston
or
even
as
far
north
as
new
york
according
to
the
distribution
of
the
fruit
supply
goodwin
lounged
upon
the
beach
with
the
usual
crowd
of
idlers
that
had
gathered
to
view
the
steamer
now
that
president
miraflores
might
be
expected
to
reach
the
borders
of
his
abjured
country
at
any
time
the
orders
were
to
keep
a
strict
and
unrelenting
watch
every
vessel
that
approached
the
shores
might
now
be
considered
a
possible
means
of
escape
for
the
fugitives
and
an
eye
was
kept
even
on
the
sloops
and
dories
that
belonged
to
the
contingent
of
coralio
goodwin
and
zavalla
moved
everywhere
but
without
ostentation
watching
the
loopholes
of
escape
the
customs
officials
crowded
importantly
into
their
boat
and
rowed
out
to
the
a
boat
from
the
steamer
landed
her
purser
with
his
papers
and
took
out
the
quarantine
doctor
with
his
green
umbrella
and
clinical
thermometer
next
a
swarm
of
caribs
began
to
load
upon
lighters
the
thousands
of
bunches
of
bananas
heaped
upon
the
shore
and
row
them
out
to
the
steamer
the
had
no
passenger
list
and
was
soon
done
with
the
attention
of
the
authorities
the
purser
declared
that
the
steamer
would
remain
at
anchor
until
morning
taking
on
her
fruit
during
the
night
the
had
come
he
said
from
new
york
to
which
port
her
latest
load
of
oranges
and
cocoanuts
had
been
conveyed
two
or
three
of
the
freighter
sloops
were
engaged
to
assist
in
the
work
for
the
captain
was
anxious
to
make
a
quick
return
in
order
to
reap
the
advantage
offered
by
a
certain
dearth
of
fruit
in
the
states
about
four
in
the
afternoon
another
of
those
marine
monsters
not
very
familiar
in
those
waters
hove
in
sight
following
the
fateful
a
graceful
steam
yacht
painted
a
light
buff
as
a
steel
engraving
the
beautiful
vessel
hovered
off
shore
the
waves
as
lightly
as
a
duck
in
a
rain
barrel
a
swift
boat
manned
by
a
crew
in
uniform
came
ashore
and
a
man
leaped
to
the
sands
the
seemed
to
turn
a
disapproving
eye
upon
the
rather
motley
congregation
of
native
anchurians
and
made
his
way
at
once
toward
goodwin
who
was
the
most
conspicuously
figure
present
goodwin
greeted
him
with
courtesy
conversation
developed
that
the
newly
landed
one
was
named
smith
and
that
he
had
come
in
a
yacht
a
meagre
biography
truly
for
the
yacht
was
most
apparent
and
the
smith
not
beyond
a
reasonable
guess
before
the
revelation
yet
to
the
eye
of
goodwin
who
had
seen
several
things
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
smith
and
his
yacht
a
man
smith
was
with
an
oblique
dead
eye
and
the
moustache
of
a
and
unless
he
had
shifted
costumes
before
putting
off
for
shore
he
had
affronted
the
deck
of
his
correct
vessel
clad
in
a
derby
a
gay
plaid
suit
and
vaudeville
neckwear
men
owning
pleasure
yachts
generally
harmonize
better
with
them
smith
looked
business
but
he
was
no
advertiser
he
commented
upon
the
scenery
remarking
upon
its
fidelity
to
the
pictures
in
the
geography
and
then
inquired
for
the
united
states
consul
goodwin
pointed
out
the
bunting
hanging
above
the
little
consulate
which
was
concealed
behind
the
geddie
the
consul
will
be
sure
to
be
there
said
goodwin
he
was
very
nearly
drowned
a
few
days
ago
while
taking
a
swim
in
the
sea
and
the
doctor
has
ordered
him
to
remain
indoors
for
some
time
smith
plowed
his
way
through
the
sand
to
the
consulate
his
haberdashery
creating
violent
discord
against
the
smooth
tropical
blues
and
greens
geddie
was
lounging
in
his
hammock
somewhat
pale
of
face
and
languid
in
pose
on
that
night
when
the
boat
had
brought
him
ashore
apparently
drenched
to
death
by
the
sea
doctor
gregg
and
his
other
friends
had
toiled
for
hours
to
preserve
the
little
spark
of
life
that
remained
to
him
the
bottle
with
its
impotent
message
was
gone
out
to
sea
and
the
problem
that
it
had
provoked
was
reduced
to
a
simple
sum
in
addition
one
and
one
make
two
by
the
rule
of
arithmetic
one
by
the
rule
of
romance
there
is
a
quaint
old
theory
that
man
may
have
two
souls
a
peripheral
one
which
serves
ordinarily
and
a
central
one
which
is
stirred
only
at
certain
times
but
then
with
activity
and
vigour
while
under
the
domination
of
the
former
a
man
will
shave
vote
pay
taxes
give
money
to
his
family
buy
subscription
books
and
comport
himself
on
the
average
plan
but
let
the
central
soul
suddenly
become
dominant
and
he
may
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
turn
upon
the
partner
of
his
joys
with
furious
execration
he
may
change
his
politics
while
you
could
snap
your
fingers
he
may
deal
out
deadly
insult
to
his
dearest
friend
he
may
get
him
instanter
to
a
monastery
or
a
dance
hall
he
may
elope
or
hang
himself
or
he
may
write
a
song
or
poem
or
kiss
his
wife
unasked
or
give
his
funds
to
the
search
of
a
microbe
then
the
peripheral
soul
will
return
and
we
have
our
safe
sane
citizen
again
it
is
but
the
revolt
of
the
ego
against
order
and
its
effect
is
to
shake
up
the
atoms
only
that
they
may
settle
where
they
belong
geddie
revulsion
had
been
a
mild
one
no
more
than
a
swim
in
a
summer
sea
after
so
inglorious
an
object
as
a
drifting
bottle
and
now
he
was
himself
again
upon
his
desk
ready
for
the
post
was
a
letter
to
his
government
tendering
his
resignation
as
consul
to
be
effective
as
soon
as
another
could
be
appointed
in
his
place
for
bernard
brannigan
who
never
did
things
in
a
manner
was
to
take
geddie
at
once
for
a
partner
in
his
very
profitable
and
various
enterprises
and
paula
was
happily
engaged
in
plans
for
refurnishing
and
decorating
the
upper
story
of
the
brannigan
house
the
consul
rose
from
his
hammock
when
he
saw
the
conspicuous
stranger
in
his
door
keep
your
seat
old
man
said
the
visitor
with
an
airy
wave
of
his
large
hand
my
name
smith
and
i
come
in
a
yacht
you
are
the
consul
is
that
right
a
big
cool
guy
on
the
beach
directed
me
here
thought
i
pay
my
respects
to
the
flag
sit
down
said
geddie
i
been
admiring
your
craft
ever
since
it
came
in
sight
looks
like
a
fast
sailer
what
her
tonnage
search
me
said
smith
i
do
know
what
she
weighs
in
at
but
she
got
a
tidy
gait
the
that
her
name
do
take
the
dust
of
anything
afloat
this
is
my
first
trip
on
her
i
taking
a
squint
along
this
coast
just
to
get
an
idea
of
the
countries
where
the
rubber
and
red
pepper
and
revolutions
come
from
i
had
no
idea
there
was
so
much
scenery
down
here
why
central
park
ai
in
it
with
this
neck
of
the
woods
i
from
new
york
they
get
monkeys
and
cocoanuts
and
parrots
down
here
is
that
right
we
have
them
all
said
geddie
i
quite
sure
that
our
fauna
and
flora
would
take
a
prize
over
central
park
maybe
they
would
admitted
smith
cheerfully
i
have
seen
them
yet
but
i
guess
you
got
us
skinned
on
the
animal
and
vegetation
question
you
do
have
much
travel
here
do
you
travel
queried
the
consul
i
suppose
you
mean
passengers
on
the
steamers
no
very
few
people
land
in
coralio
an
investor
now
and
then
tourists
and
generally
go
further
down
the
coast
to
one
of
the
larger
towns
where
there
is
a
harbour
i
see
a
ship
out
there
loading
up
with
bananas
said
smith
any
passengers
come
on
her
that
the
said
the
consul
she
a
tramp
fruiter
made
her
last
trip
to
new
york
i
believe
no
she
brought
no
passengers
i
saw
her
boat
come
ashore
and
there
was
no
one
about
the
only
exciting
recreation
we
have
here
is
watching
steamers
when
they
arrive
and
a
passenger
on
one
of
them
generally
causes
the
whole
town
to
turn
out
if
you
are
going
to
remain
in
coralio
a
while
smith
i
be
glad
to
take
you
around
to
meet
some
people
there
are
four
or
five
american
chaps
that
are
good
to
know
besides
the
native
thanks
said
the
yachtsman
but
i
would
put
you
to
the
trouble
i
like
to
meet
the
guys
you
speak
of
but
i
wo
be
here
long
enough
to
do
much
knocking
around
that
cool
gent
on
the
beach
spoke
of
a
doctor
can
you
tell
me
where
i
could
find
him
the
ai
quite
as
steady
on
her
feet
as
a
broadway
hotel
and
a
fellow
gets
a
touch
of
seasickness
now
and
then
thought
i
strike
the
croaker
for
a
handful
of
the
little
sugar
pills
in
case
i
need
you
will
be
apt
to
find
gregg
at
the
hotel
said
the
consul
you
can
see
it
from
the
door
it
that
building
with
the
balcony
where
the
are
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
was
a
dreary
hostelry
in
great
disuse
both
by
strangers
and
friends
it
stood
at
a
corner
of
the
street
of
the
holy
sepulchre
a
grove
of
small
crowded
against
one
side
of
it
enclosed
by
a
low
rock
wall
over
which
a
tall
man
might
easily
step
the
house
was
of
plastered
adobe
stained
a
hundred
shades
of
colour
by
the
salt
breeze
and
the
sun
upon
its
upper
balcony
opened
a
central
door
and
two
windows
containing
broad
jalousies
instead
of
sashes
the
lower
floor
communicated
by
two
doorways
with
the
narrow
sidewalk
the
or
drinking
shop
of
the
proprietress
madama
timotea
ortiz
occupied
the
ground
floor
on
the
bottles
of
brandy
scotch
smoke
and
inexpensive
wines
behind
the
little
counter
the
dust
lay
thick
save
where
the
fingers
of
infrequent
customers
had
left
irregular
prints
the
upper
story
contained
four
or
five
which
were
rarely
put
to
their
destined
use
sometimes
a
riding
in
from
his
plantation
to
confer
with
his
agent
would
pass
a
melancholy
night
in
the
dismal
upper
story
sometimes
a
minor
native
official
on
some
trifling
government
quest
would
have
his
pomp
and
majesty
awed
by
sepulchral
hospitality
but
madama
sat
behind
her
bar
content
not
desiring
to
quarrel
with
fate
if
anyone
required
meat
drink
or
lodging
at
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
they
had
but
to
come
and
be
served
if
they
came
not
why
then
they
came
not
as
the
exceptional
yachtsman
was
making
his
way
down
the
precarious
sidewalk
of
the
street
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
solitary
permanent
guest
of
that
decaying
hotel
sat
at
its
door
enjoying
the
breeze
from
the
sea
gregg
the
quarantine
physician
was
a
man
of
fifty
or
sixty
with
a
florid
face
and
the
longest
beard
between
topeka
and
terra
del
fuego
he
held
his
position
by
virtue
of
an
appointment
by
the
board
of
health
of
a
seaport
city
in
one
of
the
southern
states
that
city
feared
the
ancient
enemy
of
every
southern
seaport
the
yellow
fever
and
it
was
the
duty
of
gregg
to
examine
crew
and
passengers
of
every
vessel
leaving
coralio
for
preliminary
symptoms
the
duties
were
light
and
the
salary
for
one
who
lived
in
coralio
ample
surplus
time
there
was
in
plenty
and
the
good
doctor
added
to
his
gains
by
a
large
private
practice
among
the
residents
of
the
coast
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know
ten
words
of
spanish
was
no
obstacle
a
pulse
could
be
felt
and
a
fee
collected
without
one
being
a
linguist
add
to
the
description
the
facts
that
the
doctor
had
a
story
to
tell
concerning
the
operation
of
trepanning
which
no
listener
had
ever
allowed
him
to
conclude
and
that
he
believed
in
brandy
as
a
prophylactic
and
the
special
points
of
interest
possessed
by
gregg
will
have
become
exhausted
the
doctor
had
dragged
a
chair
to
the
sidewalk
he
was
coatless
and
he
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
smoked
while
he
stroked
his
beard
surprise
came
into
his
pale
blue
eyes
when
he
caught
sight
of
smith
in
his
unusual
and
prismatic
clothes
you
gregg
is
that
right
said
smith
feeling
the
dog
head
pin
in
his
tie
the
constable
i
mean
the
consul
told
me
you
hung
out
at
this
caravansary
my
name
smith
and
i
came
in
a
yacht
taking
a
cruise
around
looking
at
the
monkeys
and
come
inside
and
have
a
drink
doc
this
café
looks
on
the
blink
but
i
guess
it
can
set
out
something
wet
i
will
join
you
sir
in
just
a
taste
of
brandy
said
gregg
rising
quickly
i
find
that
as
a
prophylactic
a
little
brandy
is
almost
a
necessity
in
this
climate
as
they
turned
to
enter
the
a
native
man
barefoot
glided
noiselessly
up
and
addressed
the
doctor
in
spanish
he
was
like
an
lemon
he
wore
a
cotton
shirt
and
ragged
linen
trousers
girded
by
a
leather
belt
his
face
was
like
an
animal
live
and
wary
but
without
promise
of
much
intelligence
this
man
jabbered
with
animation
and
so
much
seriousness
that
it
seemed
a
pity
that
his
words
were
to
be
wasted
gregg
felt
his
pulse
you
sick
he
inquired
mujer
está
enferma
en
la
said
the
man
thus
endeavouring
to
convey
the
news
in
the
only
language
open
to
him
that
his
wife
lay
ill
in
her
hut
the
doctor
drew
a
handful
of
capsules
filled
with
a
white
powder
from
his
trousers
pocket
he
counted
out
ten
of
them
into
the
hand
and
held
up
his
forefinger
impressively
take
one
said
the
doctor
every
two
hours
he
then
held
up
two
fingers
shaking
them
emphatically
before
the
native
face
next
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
ran
his
finger
round
its
dial
twice
again
the
two
fingers
confronted
the
patient
nose
two
two
two
hours
repeated
the
doctor
said
the
native
sadly
he
pulled
a
cheap
silver
watch
from
his
own
pocket
and
laid
it
in
the
doctor
hand
me
bring
said
he
struggling
painfully
with
his
scant
english
other
watchy
then
he
departed
downheartedly
with
his
capsules
a
very
ignorant
race
of
people
sir
said
the
doctor
as
he
slipped
the
watch
into
his
pocket
he
seems
to
have
mistaken
my
directions
for
taking
the
physic
for
the
fee
however
it
is
all
right
he
owes
me
an
account
anyway
the
chances
are
that
he
wo
bring
the
other
watch
you
ca
depend
on
anything
they
promise
you
about
that
drink
now
how
did
you
come
to
coralio
smith
i
was
not
aware
that
any
boats
except
the
had
arrived
for
some
days
the
two
leaned
against
the
deserted
bar
and
madama
set
out
a
bottle
without
waiting
for
the
doctor
order
there
was
no
dust
on
it
after
they
had
drank
twice
smith
said
you
say
there
were
no
passengers
on
the
doc
are
you
sure
about
that
it
seems
to
me
i
heard
somebody
down
on
the
beach
say
that
there
was
one
or
two
aboard
they
were
mistaken
sir
i
myself
went
out
and
put
all
hands
through
a
medical
examination
as
usual
the
sails
as
soon
as
she
gets
her
bananas
loaded
which
will
be
about
daylight
in
the
morning
and
she
got
everything
ready
this
afternoon
no
sir
there
was
no
passenger
list
like
that
a
french
schooner
landed
two
slooploads
of
it
a
month
ago
if
any
customs
duties
on
it
went
to
the
distinguished
republic
of
anchuria
you
may
have
my
hat
if
you
have
another
come
out
and
let
sit
in
the
cool
a
while
it
often
we
exiles
get
a
chance
to
talk
with
somebody
from
the
outside
world
the
doctor
brought
out
another
chair
to
the
sidewalk
for
his
new
acquaintance
the
two
seated
themselves
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
said
gregg
a
man
of
travel
and
experience
your
decision
in
a
matter
of
ethics
and
no
doubt
on
the
points
of
equity
ability
and
professional
probity
should
be
of
value
i
would
be
glad
if
you
will
listen
to
the
history
of
a
case
that
i
think
stands
unique
in
medical
annals
about
nine
years
ago
while
i
was
engaged
in
the
practice
of
medicine
in
my
native
city
i
was
called
to
treat
a
case
of
contusion
of
the
skull
i
made
the
diagnosis
that
a
splinter
of
bone
was
pressing
upon
the
brain
and
that
the
surgical
operation
known
as
trepanning
was
required
however
as
the
patient
was
a
gentleman
of
wealth
and
position
i
called
in
for
consultation
smith
rose
from
his
chair
and
laid
a
hand
soft
with
apology
upon
the
doctor
shirt
sleeve
say
doc
he
said
solemnly
i
want
to
hear
that
story
you
got
me
interested
and
i
do
want
to
miss
the
rest
of
it
i
know
it
a
loola
by
the
way
it
begins
and
i
want
to
tell
it
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
barney
association
if
you
do
mind
but
i
got
one
or
two
matters
to
attend
to
first
if
i
get
attended
to
in
time
i
come
right
back
and
hear
you
spiel
the
rest
before
bedtime
is
that
right
by
all
means
said
the
doctor
get
your
business
attended
to
and
then
return
i
shall
wait
up
for
you
you
see
one
of
the
most
prominent
physicians
at
the
consultation
diagnosed
the
trouble
as
a
blood
clot
another
said
it
was
an
abscess
but
i
do
tell
me
now
doc
do
spoil
the
story
wait
till
i
come
back
i
want
to
hear
it
as
it
runs
off
the
reel
is
that
right
the
mountains
reached
up
their
bulky
shoulders
to
receive
the
level
gallop
of
apollo
homing
steeds
the
day
died
in
the
lagoons
and
in
the
shadowed
banana
groves
and
in
the
mangrove
swamps
where
the
great
blue
crabs
were
beginning
to
crawl
to
land
for
their
nightly
ramble
and
it
died
at
last
upon
the
highest
peaks
then
the
brief
twilight
ephemeral
as
the
flight
of
a
moth
came
and
went
the
southern
cross
peeped
with
its
topmost
eye
above
a
row
of
palms
and
the
heralded
with
their
torches
the
approach
of
night
in
the
offing
the
swayed
at
anchor
her
lights
seeming
to
penetrate
the
water
to
countless
fathoms
with
their
shimmering
lanceolate
reflections
the
caribs
were
busy
loading
her
by
means
of
the
great
lighters
heaped
full
from
the
piles
of
fruit
ranged
upon
the
shore
on
the
sandy
beach
with
his
back
against
a
and
the
stubs
of
many
cigars
lying
around
him
smith
sat
waiting
never
relaxing
his
sharp
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
steamer
the
incongruous
yachtsman
had
concentrated
his
interest
upon
the
innocent
fruiter
twice
had
he
been
assured
that
no
passengers
had
come
to
coralio
on
board
of
her
and
yet
with
a
persistence
not
to
be
attributed
to
an
idling
voyager
he
had
appealed
the
case
to
the
higher
court
of
his
own
eyesight
surprisingly
like
some
lizard
he
crouched
at
the
foot
of
the
cocoanut
palm
and
with
the
beady
shifting
eyes
of
the
selfsame
reptile
sustained
his
espionage
on
the
on
the
white
sands
a
whiter
gig
belonging
to
the
yacht
was
drawn
up
guarded
by
one
of
the
crew
not
far
away
in
a
on
the
calle
grande
three
other
sailors
swaggered
with
their
cues
around
coralio
solitary
the
boat
lay
there
as
if
under
orders
to
be
ready
for
use
at
any
moment
there
was
in
the
atmosphere
a
hint
of
expectation
of
waiting
for
something
to
occur
which
was
foreign
to
the
air
of
coralio
like
some
passing
bird
of
brilliant
plumage
smith
alights
on
this
palmy
shore
but
to
preen
his
wings
for
an
instant
and
then
to
fly
away
upon
silent
pinions
when
morning
dawned
there
was
no
smith
no
waiting
gig
no
yacht
in
the
offing
smith
left
no
intimation
of
his
mission
there
no
footprints
to
show
where
he
had
followed
the
trail
of
his
mystery
on
the
sands
of
coralio
that
night
he
came
he
spake
his
strange
jargon
of
the
asphalt
and
the
cafés
he
sat
under
the
and
vanished
the
next
morning
coralio
smithless
ate
its
fried
plantain
and
said
the
man
of
pictured
clothing
went
himself
away
with
the
the
incident
passed
yawning
into
history
so
for
a
time
must
smith
pass
behind
the
scenes
of
the
play
he
comes
no
more
to
coralio
nor
to
doctor
gregg
who
sits
in
vain
wagging
his
redundant
beard
waiting
to
enrich
his
derelict
audience
with
his
moving
tale
of
trepanning
and
jealousy
but
prosperously
to
the
lucidity
of
these
loose
pages
smith
shall
flutter
among
them
again
in
the
nick
of
time
he
shall
come
to
tell
us
why
he
strewed
so
many
anxious
cigar
stumps
around
the
cocoanut
palm
that
night
this
he
must
do
for
when
he
sailed
away
before
the
dawn
in
his
yacht
he
carried
with
him
the
answer
to
a
riddle
so
big
and
preposterous
that
few
in
anchuria
had
ventured
even
to
propound
it
iv
caught
the
plans
for
the
detention
of
the
flying
president
miraflores
and
his
companion
at
the
coast
line
seemed
hardly
likely
to
fail
zavalla
himself
had
gone
to
the
port
of
alazan
to
establish
a
guard
at
that
point
at
solitas
the
liberal
patriot
varras
could
be
depended
upon
to
keep
close
watch
goodwin
held
himself
responsible
for
the
district
about
coralio
the
news
of
the
president
flight
had
been
disclosed
to
no
one
in
the
coast
towns
save
trusted
members
of
the
ambitious
political
party
that
was
desirous
of
succeeding
to
power
the
telegraph
wire
running
from
san
mateo
to
the
coast
had
been
cut
far
up
on
the
mountain
trail
by
an
emissary
of
zavalla
long
before
this
could
be
repaired
and
word
received
along
it
from
the
capital
the
fugitives
would
have
reached
the
coast
and
the
question
of
escape
or
capture
been
solved
goodwin
had
stationed
armed
sentinels
at
frequent
intervals
along
the
shore
for
a
mile
in
each
direction
from
coralio
they
were
instructed
to
keep
a
vigilant
lookout
during
the
night
to
prevent
miraflores
from
attempting
to
embark
stealthily
by
means
of
some
boat
or
sloop
found
by
chance
at
the
water
edge
a
dozen
patrols
walked
the
streets
of
coralio
unsuspected
ready
to
intercept
the
truant
official
should
he
show
himself
there
goodwin
was
very
well
convinced
that
no
precautions
had
been
overlooked
he
strolled
about
the
streets
that
bore
such
names
and
were
but
narrow
lanes
lending
his
own
aid
to
the
vigil
that
had
been
intrusted
to
him
by
bob
englehart
the
town
had
begun
the
tepid
round
of
its
nightly
diversions
a
few
leisurely
dandies
clad
in
white
duck
with
flowing
neckties
and
swinging
slim
bamboo
canes
threaded
the
grassy
toward
the
houses
of
their
favoured
señoritas
those
who
wooed
the
art
of
music
dragged
tirelessly
at
whining
concertinas
or
fingered
lugubrious
guitars
at
doors
and
windows
an
occasional
soldier
from
the
with
flapping
straw
hat
without
coat
or
shoes
hurried
by
balancing
his
long
gun
like
a
lance
in
one
hand
from
every
density
of
the
foliage
the
giant
tree
frogs
sounded
their
loud
and
irritating
clatter
further
out
where
the
perished
at
the
brink
of
the
jungle
the
guttural
cries
of
marauding
baboons
and
the
coughing
of
the
alligators
in
the
black
estuaries
fractured
the
vain
silence
of
the
wood
by
ten
the
streets
were
deserted
the
oil
lamps
that
had
burned
a
sickly
yellow
at
random
corners
had
been
extinguished
by
some
economical
civic
agent
coralio
lay
sleeping
calmly
between
toppling
mountains
and
encroaching
sea
like
a
stolen
babe
in
the
arms
of
its
abductors
somewhere
over
in
that
tropical
darkness
perhaps
already
threading
the
profundities
of
the
alluvial
lowlands
the
high
adventurer
and
his
mate
were
moving
toward
land
end
the
game
of
should
be
coming
soon
to
its
close
goodwin
at
his
deliberate
gait
passed
the
long
low
where
coralio
contingent
of
anchuria
military
force
slumbered
with
its
bare
toes
pointed
heavenward
there
was
a
law
that
no
civilian
might
come
so
near
the
headquarters
of
that
citadel
of
war
after
nine
but
goodwin
was
always
forgetting
the
minor
statutes
vive
shrieked
the
sentinel
wrestling
prodigiously
with
his
lengthy
musket
growled
goodwin
without
turning
his
head
and
passed
on
unhalted
to
the
right
he
turned
and
to
the
left
up
the
street
that
ultimately
reached
the
plaza
nacional
when
within
the
toss
of
a
cigar
stump
from
the
intersecting
street
of
the
holy
sepulchre
he
stopped
suddenly
in
the
pathway
he
saw
the
form
of
a
tall
man
clothed
in
black
and
carrying
a
large
valise
hurry
down
the
in
the
direction
of
the
beach
and
goodwin
second
glance
made
him
aware
of
a
woman
at
the
elbow
on
the
farther
side
who
seemed
to
urge
forward
if
not
even
to
assist
her
companion
in
their
swift
but
silent
progress
they
were
no
coralians
those
two
goodwin
followed
at
increased
speed
but
without
any
of
the
artful
tactics
that
are
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
sleuth
the
american
was
too
broad
to
feel
the
instinct
of
the
detective
he
stood
as
an
agent
for
the
people
of
anchuria
and
but
for
political
reasons
he
would
have
demanded
then
and
there
the
money
it
was
the
design
of
his
party
to
secure
the
imperilled
fund
to
restore
it
to
the
treasury
of
the
country
and
to
declare
itself
in
power
without
bloodshed
or
resistance
the
couple
halted
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
and
the
man
struck
upon
the
wood
with
the
impatience
of
one
unused
to
his
entry
being
stayed
madama
was
long
in
response
but
after
a
time
her
light
showed
the
door
was
opened
and
the
guests
housed
goodwin
stood
in
the
quiet
street
lighting
another
cigar
in
two
minutes
a
faint
gleam
began
to
show
between
the
slats
of
the
jalousies
in
the
upper
story
of
the
hotel
they
have
engaged
rooms
said
goodwin
to
himself
so
then
their
arrangements
for
sailing
have
yet
to
be
made
at
that
moment
there
came
along
one
estebán
delgado
a
barber
an
enemy
to
existing
government
a
jovial
plotter
against
stagnation
in
any
form
this
barber
was
one
of
coralio
saddest
dogs
often
remaining
out
of
doors
as
late
as
eleven
post
meridian
he
was
a
partisan
liberal
and
he
greeted
goodwin
with
flatulent
importance
as
a
brother
in
the
cause
but
he
had
something
important
to
tell
what
think
you
don
frank
he
cried
in
the
universal
tone
of
the
conspirator
i
have
shaved
what
you
call
the
of
the
himself
of
this
countree
consider
he
sent
for
me
to
come
in
the
poor
of
an
old
woman
he
awaited
me
in
a
verree
leetle
house
in
a
dark
place
el
señor
presidente
to
make
himself
thus
secret
and
obscured
i
think
he
desired
not
to
be
known
but
can
you
shave
a
man
and
not
see
his
face
this
gold
piece
he
gave
me
and
said
it
was
to
be
all
quite
still
i
think
don
frank
there
is
what
you
call
a
chip
over
the
bug
have
you
ever
seen
president
miraflores
before
asked
goodwin
but
once
answered
estebán
he
is
tall
and
he
had
weeskers
verree
black
and
sufficient
was
anyone
else
present
when
you
shaved
him
an
old
indian
woman
señor
that
belonged
with
the
and
one
señorita
a
ladee
of
so
much
beautee
dios
all
right
estebán
said
goodwin
it
very
lucky
that
you
happened
along
with
your
tonsorial
information
the
new
administration
will
be
likely
to
remember
you
for
this
then
in
a
few
words
he
made
the
barber
acquainted
with
the
crisis
into
which
the
affairs
of
the
nation
had
culminated
and
instructed
him
to
remain
outside
keeping
watch
upon
the
two
sides
of
the
hotel
that
looked
upon
the
street
and
observing
whether
anyone
should
attempt
to
leave
the
house
by
any
door
or
window
goodwin
himself
went
to
the
door
through
which
the
guests
had
entered
opened
it
and
stepped
inside
madama
had
returned
downstairs
from
her
journey
above
to
see
after
the
comfort
of
her
lodgers
her
candle
stood
upon
the
bar
she
was
about
to
take
a
thimbleful
of
rum
as
a
solace
for
having
her
rest
disturbed
she
looked
up
without
surprise
or
alarm
as
her
third
caller
entered
ah
it
is
the
señor
goodwin
not
often
does
he
honour
my
poor
house
by
his
presence
i
must
come
oftener
said
goodwin
with
the
goodwin
smile
i
hear
that
your
cognac
is
the
best
between
belize
to
the
north
and
rio
to
the
south
set
out
the
bottle
madama
and
let
us
have
the
proof
in
for
each
of
us
my
said
madama
with
pride
is
the
best
it
grows
in
beautiful
bottles
in
the
dark
places
among
the
only

midnight
can
they
be
picked
by
who
bring
them
before
daylight
comes
to
your
back
door
good
is
a
verree
difficult
fruit
to
handle
señor
goodwin
smuggling
in
coralio
was
much
nearer
than
competition
to
being
the
life
of
trade
one
spoke
of
it
slyly
yet
with
a
certain
conceit
when
it
had
been
well
accomplished
you
have
guests
in
the
house
said
goodwin
laying
a
silver
dollar
upon
the
counter
why
not
said
madama
counting
the
change
two
but
the
smallest
while
finished
to
arrive
one
señor
not
quite
old
and
one
señorita
of
sufficient
handsomeness
to
their
rooms
they
have
ascended
not
desiring
the
nor
the
two
rooms
and
i
was
expecting
that
gentleman
and
that
lady
said
goodwin
i
have
important
that
must
be
transacted
will
you
allow
me
to
see
them
why
not
sighed
madama
placidly
why
should
not
señor
goodwin
ascend
and
speak
to
his
friends
room
and
room
goodwin
loosened
in
his
coat
pocket
the
american
revolver
that
he
carried
and
ascended
the
steep
dark
stairway
in
the
hallway
above
the
saffron
light
from
a
hanging
lamp
allowed
him
to
select
the
gaudy
numbers
on
the
doors
he
turned
the
knob
of
number
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
if
that
was
isabel
guilbert
seated
by
the
table
in
that
poorly
furnished
room
report
had
failed
to
do
her
charms
justice
she
rested
her
head
upon
one
hand
extreme
fatigue
was
signified
in
every
line
of
her
figure
and
upon
her
countenance
a
deep
perplexity
was
written
her
eyes
were
and
of
that
mould
that
seems
to
have
belonged
to
the
orbs
of
all
the
famous
queens
of
hearts
their
whites
were
singularly
clear
and
brilliant
concealed
above
the
irises
by
heavy
horizontal
lids
and
showing
a
snowy
line
below
them
such
eyes
denote
great
nobility
vigour
and
if
you
can
conceive
of
it
a
most
generous
selfishness
she
looked
up
when
the
american
entered
with
an
expression
of
surprised
inquiry
but
without
alarm
goodwin
took
off
his
hat
and
seated
himself
with
his
characteristic
deliberate
ease
upon
a
corner
of
the
table
he
held
a
lighted
cigar
between
his
fingers
he
took
this
familiar
course
because
he
was
sure
that
preliminaries
would
be
wasted
upon
miss
guilbert
he
knew
her
history
and
the
small
part
that
the
conventions
had
played
in
it
good
evening
he
said
now
madame
let
us
come
to
business
at
once
you
will
observe
that
i
mention
no
names
but
i
know
who
is
in
the
next
room
and
what
he
carries
in
that
valise
that
is
the
point
which
brings
me
here
i
have
come
to
dictate
terms
of
surrender
the
lady
neither
moved
nor
replied
but
steadily
regarded
the
cigar
in
goodwin
hand
we
continued
the
dictator
thoughtfully
regarding
the
neat
buckskin
shoe
on
his
gently
swinging
foot
i
speak
for
a
considerable
majority
of
the
people
demand
the
return
of
the
stolen
funds
belonging
to
them
our
terms
go
very
little
further
than
that
they
are
very
simple
as
an
accredited
spokesman
i
promise
that
our
interference
will
cease
if
they
are
accepted
give
up
the
money
and
you
and
your
companion
will
be
permitted
to
proceed
wherever
you
will
in
fact
assistance
will
be
given
you
in
the
matter
of
securing
a
passage
by
any
outgoing
vessel
you
may
choose
it
is
on
my
personal
responsibility
that
i
add
congratulations
to
the
gentleman
in
number
upon
his
taste
in
feminine
charms
returning
his
cigar
to
his
mouth
goodwin
observed
her
and
saw
that
her
eyes
followed
it
and
rested
upon
it
with
icy
and
significant
concentration
apparently
she
had
not
heard
a
word
he
had
said
he
understood
tossed
the
cigar
out
the
window
and
with
an
amused
laugh
slid
from
the
table
to
his
feet
that
is
better
said
the
lady
it
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
listen
to
you
for
a
second
lesson
in
good
manners
you
might
now
tell
me
by
whom
i
am
being
insulted
i
am
sorry
said
goodwin
leaning
one
hand
on
the
table
that
my
time
is
too
brief
for
devoting
much
of
it
to
a
course
of
etiquette
come
now
i
appeal
to
your
good
sense
you
have
shown
yourself
in
more
than
one
instance
to
be
well
aware
of
what
is
to
your
advantage
this
is
an
occasion
that
demands
the
exercise
of
your
undoubted
intelligence
there
is
no
mystery
here
i
am
frank
goodwin
and
i
have
come
for
the
money
i
entered
this
room
at
a
venture
had
i
entered
the
other
i
would
have
had
it
before
now
do
you
want
it
in
words
the
gentleman
in
number
has
betrayed
a
great
trust
he
has
robbed
his
people
of
a
large
sum
and
it
is
i
who
will
prevent
their
losing
it
i
do
not
say
who
that
gentleman
is
but
if
i
should
be
forced
to
see
him
and
he
should
prove
to
be
a
certain
high
official
of
the
republic
it
will
be
my
duty
to
arrest
him
the
house
is
guarded
i
am
offering
you
liberal
terms
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
that
i
confer
personally
with
the
gentleman
in
the
next
room
bring
me
the
valise
containing
the
money
and
we
will
call
the
affair
ended
the
lady
arose
from
her
chair
and
stood
for
a
moment
thinking
deeply
do
you
live
here
mr
goodwin
she
asked
presently
yes
what
is
your
authority
for
this
intrusion
i
am
an
instrument
of
the
republic
i
was
advised
by
wire
of
the
movements
of
the
gentleman
in
number
may
i
ask
you
two
or
three
questions
i
believe
you
to
be
a
man
more
apt
to
be
truthful
than
timid
what
sort
of
a
town
is
this
coralio
i
think
they
call
it
not
much
of
a
town
said
goodwin
smiling
a
banana
town
as
they
run
grass
huts
five
or
six
houses
accommodations
limited
population
spanish
and
indian
caribs
and
blackamoors
no
sidewalks
to
speak
of
no
amusements
rather
unmoral
that
an
offhand
sketch
of
course
are
there
any
inducements
say
in
a
social
or
in
a
business
way
for
people
to
reside
here
oh
yes
answered
goodwin
smiling
broadly
there
are
no
afternoon
teas
no
no
department
stores
and
there
is
no
extradition
treaty
he
told
me
went
on
the
lady
speaking
as
if
to
herself
and
with
a
slight
frown
that
there
were
towns
on
this
coast
of
beauty
and
importance
that
there
was
a
pleasing
social
order
especially
an
american
colony
of
cultured
residents
there
is
an
american
colony
said
goodwin
gazing
at
her
in
some
wonder
some
of
the
members
are
all
right
some
are
fugitives
from
justice
from
the
states
i
recall
two
exiled
bank
presidents
one
army
paymaster
under
a
cloud
a
couple
of
manslayers
and
a
widow
arsenic
i
believe
was
the
suspicion
in
her
case
i
myself
complete
the
colony
but
as
yet
i
have
not
distinguished
myself
by
any
particular
crime
do
not
lose
hope
said
the
lady
dryly
i
see
nothing
in
your
actions
to
guarantee
you
further
obscurity
some
mistake
has
been
made
i
do
not
know
just
where
but
you
shall
not
disturb
the
journey
has
fatigued
him
so
that
he
has
fallen
asleep
i
think
in
his
clothes
you
talk
of
stolen
money
i
do
not
understand
you
some
mistake
has
been
made
i
will
convince
you
remain
where
you
are
and
i
will
bring
you
the
valise
that
you
seem
to
covet
so
and
show
it
to
you
she
moved
toward
the
closed
door
that
connected
the
two
rooms
but
stopped
and
half
turned
and
bestowed
upon
goodwin
a
grave
searching
look
that
ended
in
a
quizzical
smile
you
force
my
door
she
said
and
you
follow
your
ruffianly
behaviour
with
the
basest
accusations
and
yet
she
hesitated
as
if
to
reconsider
what
she
was
about
to
say
and
yet
it
is
a
puzzling
thing
i
am
sure
there
has
been
some
mistake
she
took
a
step
toward
the
door
but
goodwin
stayed
her
by
a
light
touch
upon
her
arm
i
have
said
before
that
women
turned
to
look
at
him
in
the
streets
he
was
the
viking
sort
of
man
big
and
with
an
air
of
kindly
truculence
she
was
dark
and
proud
glowing
or
pale
as
her
mood
moved
her
i
do
not
know
if
eve
were
light
or
dark
but
if
such
a
woman
had
stood
in
the
garden
i
know
that
the
apple
would
have
been
eaten
this
woman
was
to
be
goodwin
fate
and
he
did
not
know
it
but
he
must
have
felt
the
first
throes
of
destiny
for
as
he
faced
her
the
knowledge
of
what
report
named
her
turned
bitter
in
his
throat
if
there
has
been
any
mistake
he
said
hotly
it
was
yours
i
do
not
blame
the
man
who
has
lost
his
country
his
honour
and
is
about
to
lose
the
poor
consolation
of
his
stolen
riches
as
much
as
i
blame
you
for
by
heaven
i
can
very
well
see
how
he
was
brought
to
it
i
can
understand
and
pity
him
it
is
such
women
as
you
that
strew
this
degraded
coast
with
wretched
exiles
that
make
men
forget
their
trusts
that
drag
the
lady
interrupted
him
with
a
weary
gesture
there
is
no
need
to
continue
your
insults
she
said
coldly
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
saying
nor
do
i
know
what
mad
blunder
you
are
making
but
if
the
inspection
of
the
contents
of
a
gentleman
portmanteau
will
rid
me
of
you
let
us
delay
it
no
longer
she
passed
quickly
and
noiselessly
into
the
other
room
and
returned
with
the
heavy
leather
valise
which
she
handed
to
the
american
with
an
air
of
patient
contempt
goodwin
set
the
valise
quickly
upon
the
table
and
began
to
unfasten
the
straps
the
lady
stood
by
with
an
expression
of
infinite
scorn
and
weariness
upon
her
face
the
valise
opened
wide
to
a
powerful
sidelong
wrench
goodwin
dragged
out
two
or
three
articles
of
clothing
exposing
the
bulk
of
its
contents
package
after
package
of
tightly
packed
united
states
bank
and
treasury
notes
of
large
denomination
reckoning
from
the
high
figures
written
upon
the
paper
bands
that
bound
them
the
total
must
have
come
closely
upon
the
hundred
thousand
mark
goodwin
glanced
swiftly
at
the
woman
and
saw
with
surprise
and
a
thrill
of
pleasure
that
he
wondered
at
that
she
had
experienced
an
unmistakable
shock
her
eyes
grew
wide
she
gasped
and
leaned
heavily
against
the
table
she
had
been
ignorant
then
he
inferred
that
her
companion
had
looted
the
government
treasury
but
why
he
angrily
asked
himself
should
he
be
so
well
pleased
to
think
this
wandering
and
unscrupulous
singer
not
so
black
as
report
had
painted
her
a
noise
in
the
other
room
startled
them
both
the
door
swung
open
and
a
tall
elderly
dark
complexioned
man
recently
shaven
hurried
into
the
room
all
the
pictures
of
president
miraflores
represent
him
as
the
possessor
of
a
luxuriant
supply
of
dark
and
carefully
tended
whiskers
but
the
story
of
the
barber
estebán
had
prepared
goodwin
for
the
change
the
man
stumbled
in
from
the
dark
room
his
eyes
blinking
at
the
lamplight
and
heavy
from
sleep
what
does
this
mean
he
demanded
in
excellent
english
with
a
keen
and
perturbed
look
at
the
american
robbery
very
near
it
answered
goodwin
but
i
rather
think
i
in
time
to
prevent
it
i
represent
the
people
to
whom
this
money
belongs
and
i
have
come
to
convey
it
back
to
them
he
thrust
his
hand
into
a
pocket
of
his
loose
linen
coat
the
other
man
hand
went
quickly
behind
him
do
draw
called
goodwin
sharply
i
got
you
covered
from
my
pocket
the
lady
stepped
forward
and
laid
one
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
her
hesitating
companion
she
pointed
to
the
table
tell
me
the
truth
the
truth
she
said
in
a
low
voice
whose
money
is
that
the
man
did
not
answer
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
leaned
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
stepped
back
into
the
other
room
and
closed
the
door
goodwin
foresaw
his
purpose
and
jumped
for
the
door
but
the
report
of
the
pistol
echoed
as
his
hand
touched
the
knob
a
heavy
fall
followed
and
some
one
swept
him
aside
and
struggled
into
the
room
of
the
fallen
man
a
desolation
thought
goodwin
greater
than
that
derived
from
the
loss
of
cavalier
and
gold
must
have
been
in
the
heart
of
the
enchantress
to
have
wrung
from
her
in
that
moment
the
cry
of
one
turning
to
the
earthly
consoler
to
have
made
her
call
out
from
that
bloody
and
dishonoured
room
oh
mother
mother
mother
but
there
was
an
alarm
outside
the
barber
estebán
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
had
raised
his
voice
and
the
shot
itself
had
aroused
half
the
town
a
pattering
of
feet
came
up
the
street
and
official
orders
rang
out
on
the
still
air
goodwin
had
a
duty
to
perform
circumstances
had
made
him
the
custodian
of
his
adopted
treasure
swiftly
cramming
the
money
into
the
valise
he
closed
it
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
and
dropped
it
into
a
thick
in
the
little
inclosure
below
they
will
tell
you
in
coralio
as
they
delight
in
telling
the
stranger
of
the
conclusion
of
that
tragic
flight
they
will
tell
you
how
the
upholders
of
the
law
came
apace
when
the
alarm
was
sounded
the
in
red
slippers
and
a
jacket
like
a
head
waiter
and
girded
sword
the
soldiers
with
their
interminable
guns
followed
by
outnumbering
officers
struggling
into
their
gold
lace
and
epaulettes
the
barefooted
policemen
the
only
capables
in
the
lot
and
ruffled
citizens
of
every
hue
and
description
they
say
that
the
countenance
of
the
dead
man
was
marred
sadly
by
the
effects
of
the
shot
but
he
was
identified
as
the
fallen
president
by
both
goodwin
and
the
barber
estebán
on
the
next
morning
messages
began
to
come
over
the
mended
telegraph
wire
and
the
story
of
the
flight
from
the
capital
was
given
out
to
the
public
in
san
mateo
the
revolutionary
party
had
seized
the
sceptre
of
government
without
opposition
and
the
of
the
mercurial
populace
quickly
effaced
the
interest
belonging
to
the
unfortunate
miraflores
they
will
relate
to
you
how
the
new
government
sifted
the
towns
and
raked
the
roads
to
find
the
valise
containing
anchuria
surplus
capital
which
the
president
was
known
to
have
carried
with
him
but
all
in
vain
in
coralio
señor
goodwin
himself
led
the
searching
party
which
combed
that
town
as
carefully
as
a
woman
combs
her
hair
but
the
money
was
not
found
so
they
buried
the
dead
man
without
honours
back
of
the
town
near
the
little
bridge
that
spans
the
mangrove
swamp
and
for
a
a
boy
will
show
you
his
grave
they
say
that
the
old
woman
in
whose
hut
the
barber
shaved
the
president
placed
the
wooden
slab
at
his
head
and
burned
the
inscription
upon
it
with
a
hot
iron
you
will
hear
also
that
señor
goodwin
like
a
tower
of
strength
shielded

there
is

of

about

and
something
of
the

sort
within
the
natives
speak
of
its
interior
with
hands
uplifted
in
admiration
there
are
floors
polished
like

and
covered
with

and

exclaim
but
they
can
not
tell

you
shall
learn

of
the

that

v

number
two
the
united
states
of
america
after
looking
over
its
stock
of
consular
timber
selected
john
de
graffenreid
atwood
of
dalesburg
alabama
for
a
successor
to
willard
geddie
resigned
without
prejudice
to
atwood
it
will
have
to
be
acknowledged
that
in
this
instance
it
was
the
man
who
sought
the
office
as
with
the
geddie
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
artful
smiles
of
lovely
woman
that
had
driven
johnny
atwood
to
the
desperate
expedient
of
accepting
office
under
a
despised
federal
government
so
that
he
might
go
far
far
away
and
never
see
again
the
false
fair
face
that
had
wrecked
his
young
life
the
consulship
at
coralio
seemed
to
offer
a
retreat
sufficiently
removed
and
romantic
enough
to
inject
the
necessary
drama
into
the
pastoral
scenes
of
dalesburg
life
it
was
while
playing
the
part
of
cupid
exile
that
johnny
added
his
handiwork
to
the
long
list
of
casualties
along
the
spanish
main
by
his
famous
manipulation
of
the
shoe
market
and
his
unparalleled
feat
of
elevating
the
most
despised
and
useless
weed
in
his
own
country
from
obscurity
to
be
a
valuable
product
in
international
commerce
the
trouble
began
as
trouble
often
begins
instead
of
ending
with
a
romance
in
dalesburg
there
was
a
man
named
elijah
hemstetter
who
kept
a
general
store
his
family
consisted
of
one
daughter
called
rosine
a
name
that
atoned
much
for
hemstetter
this
young
woman
was
possessed
of
plentiful
attractions
so
that
the
young
men
of
the
community
were
agitated
in
their
bosoms
among
the
more
agitated
was
johnny
the
son
of
judge
atwood
who
lived
in
the
big
colonial
mansion
on
the
edge
of
dalesburg
it
would
seem
that
the
desirable
rosine
should
have
been
pleased
to
return
the
affection
of
an
atwood
a
name
honoured
all
over
the
state
long
before
and
since
the
war
it
does
seem
that
she
should
have
gladly
consented
to
have
been
led
into
that
stately
but
rather
empty
colonial
mansion
but
not
so
there
was
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
a
threatening
cumulus
cloud
in
the
shape
of
a
lively
and
shrewd
young
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
who
dared
to
enter
the
lists
as
a
rival
to
the
atwood
one
night
johnny
propounded
to
rosine
a
question
that
is
considered
of
much
importance
by
the
young
of
the
human
species
the
accessories
were
all
there
moonlight
oleanders
magnolias
the
song
whether
or
no
the
shadow
of
pinkney
dawson
the
prosperous
young
farmer
came
between
them
on
that
occasion
is
not
known
but
rosine
answer
was
unfavourable
john
de
graffenreid
atwood
bowed
till
his
hat
touched
the
lawn
grass
and
went
away
with
his
head
high
but
with
a
sore
wound
in
his
pedigree
and
heart
a
hemstetter
refuse
an
atwood
zounds
among
other
accidents
of
that
year
was
a
democratic
president
judge
atwood
was
a
warhorse
of
democracy
johnny
persuaded
him
to
set
the
wheels
moving
for
some
foreign
appointment
he
would
go
away
away
perhaps
in
years
to
come
rosine
would
think
how
true
how
faithful
his
love
had
been
and
would
drop
a
tear
maybe
in
the
cream
she
would
be
skimming
for
pink
dawson
breakfast
the
wheels
of
politics
revolved
and
johnny
was
appointed
consul
to
coralio
just
before
leaving
he
dropped
in
at
hemstetter
to
say
there
was
a
queer
pinkish
look
about
rosine
eyes
and
had
the
two
been
alone
the
united
states
might
have
had
to
cast
about
for
another
consul
but
pink
dawson
was
there
of
course
talking
about
his
orchard
and
the
alfalfa
tract
and
the
pasture
so
johnny
shook
hands
with
rosine
as
coolly
as
if
he
were
only
going
to
run
up
to
montgomery
for
a
couple
of
days
they
had
the
royal
manner
when
they
chose
those
atwoods
if
you
happen
to
strike
anything
in
the
way
of
a
good
investment
down
there
johnny
said
pink
dawson
just
let
me
know
will
you
i
reckon
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
a
few
extra
thousands
any
time
for
a
profitable
deal
certainly
pink
said
johnny
pleasantly
if
i
strike
anything
of
the
sort
i
let
you
in
with
pleasure
so
johnny
went
down
to
mobile
and
took
a
fruit
steamer
for
the
coast
of
anchuria
when
the
new
consul
arrived
in
coralio
the
strangeness
of
the
scenes
diverted
him
much
he
was
only
and
the
grief
of
youth
is
not
worn
like
a
garment
as
it
is
by
older
men
it
has
its
seasons
when
it
reigns
and
then
it
is
unseated
for
a
time
by
the
assertion
of
the
keen
senses
billy
keogh
and
johnny
seemed
to
conceive
a
mutual
friendship
at
once
keogh
took
the
new
consul
about
town
and
presented
him
to
the
handful
of
americans
and
the
smaller
number
of
french
and
germans
who
made
up
the
foreign
contingent
and
then
of
course
he
had
to
be
more
formally
introduced
to
the
native
officials
and
have
his
credentials
transmitted
through
an
interpreter
there
was
something
about
the
young
southerner
that
the
sophisticated
keogh
liked
his
manner
was
simple
almost
to
boyishness
but
he
possessed
the
cool
carelessness
of
a
man
of
far
greater
age
and
experience
neither
uniforms
nor
titles
red
tape
nor
foreign
languages
mountains
nor
sea
weighed
upon
his
spirits
he
was
heir
to
all
the
ages
an
atwood
of
dalesburg
and
you
might
know
every
thought
conceived
in
his
bosom
geddie
came
down
to
the
consulate
to
explain
the
duties
and
workings
of
the
office
he
and
keogh
tried
to
interest
the
new
consul
in
their
description
of
the
work
that
his
government
expected
him
to
perform
it
all
right
said
johnny
from
the
hammock
that
he
had
set
up
as
the
official
reclining
place
if
anything
turns
up
that
has
to
be
done
i
let
you
fellows
do
it
you
ca
expect
a
democrat
to
work
during
his
first
term
of
holding
office
you
might
look
over
these
headings
suggested
geddie
of
the
different
lines
of
exports
you
will
have
to
keep
account
of
the
fruit
is
classified
and
there
are
the
valuable
woods
coffee
rubber
that
last
account
sounds
all
right
interrupted
atwood
sounds
as
if
it
could
be
stretched
i
want
to
buy
a
new
flag
a
monkey
a
guitar
and
a
barrel
of
pineapples
will
that
rubber
account
stretch
over
that
merely
statistics
said
geddie
smiling
the
expense
account
is
what
you
want
it
is
supposed
to
have
a
slight
elasticity
the
items
are
sometimes
carelessly
audited
by
the
state
department
we
wasting
our
time
said
keogh
this
man
was
born
to
hold
office
he
penetrates
to
the
root
of
the
art
at
one
step
of
his
eagle
eye
the
true
genius
of
government
shows
its
hand
in
every
word
of
his
speech
i
did
take
this
job
with
any
intention
of
working
explained
johnny
lazily
i
wanted
to
go
somewhere
in
the
world
where
they
did
talk
about
farms
there
are
none
here
are
there
not
the
kind
you
are
acquainted
with
answered
the
there
is
no
such
art
here
as
agriculture
there
never
was
a
plow
or
a
reaper
within
the
boundaries
of
anchuria
this
is
the
country
for
me
murmured
the
consul
and
immediately
he
fell
asleep
the
cheerful
tintypist
pursued
his
intimacy
with
johnny
in
spite
of
open
charges
that
he
did
so
to
obtain
a
preëmption
on
a
seat
in
that
coveted
spot
the
rear
gallery
of
the
consulate
but
whether
his
designs
were
selfish
or
purely
friendly
keogh
achieved
that
desirable
privilege
few
were
the
nights
on
which
the
two
could
not
be
found
reposing
there
in
the
sea
breeze
with
their
heels
on
the
railing
and
the
cigars
and
brandy
conveniently
near
one
evening
they
sat
thus
mainly
silent
for
their
talk
had
dwindled
before
the
stilling
influence
of
an
unusual
night
there
was
a
great
full
moon
and
the
sea
was
almost
every
sound
was
hushed
for
the
air
was
but
faintly
stirring
and
the
town
lay
panting
waiting
for
the
night
to
cool
offshore
lay
the
fruit
steamer
of
the
vesuvius
line
and
scheduled
to
sail
at
six
in
the
morning
there
were
no
loiterers
on
the
beach
so
bright
was
the
moonlight
that
the
two
men
could
see
the
small
pebbles
shining
on
the
beach
where
the
gentle
surf
wetted
them
then
down
the
coast
tacking
close
to
shore
slowly
swam
a
little
sloop
like
some
snowy
sea
fowl
its
course
lay
within
twenty
points
of
the
wind
eye
so
it
veered
in
and
out
again
in
long
slow
strokes
like
the
movements
of
a
graceful
skater
again
the
tactics
of
its
crew
brought
it
close
in
shore
this
time
nearly
opposite
the
consulate
and
then
there
blew
from
the
sloop
clear
and
surprising
notes
as
if
from
a
horn
of
elfland
a
fairy
bugle
it
might
have
been
sweet
and
silvery
and
unexpected
playing
with
spirit
the
familiar
air
of
home
sweet
home
it
was
a
scene
set
for
the
land
of
the
lotus
the
authority
of
the
sea
and
the
tropics
the
mystery
that
attends
unknown
sails
and
the
prestige
of
drifting
music
on
moonlit
waters
gave
it
an
anodynous
charm
johnny
atwood
felt
it
and
thought
of
dalesburg
but
as
soon
as
keogh
mind
had
arrived
at
a
theory
concerning
the
peripatetic
solo
he
sprang
to
the
railing
and
his
yawp
fractured
the
silence
of
coralio
like
a
cannon
shot
the
sloop
was
now
on
its
outward
tack
but
from
it
came
a
clear
answering
hail
billy
home
bye
the
was
the
sloop
destination
no
doubt
some
passenger
with
a
sailing
permit
from
some
point
had
come
down
in
this
sloop
to
catch
the
regular
fruit
steamer
on
its
return
trip
like
a
coquettish
pigeon
the
little
boat
tacked
on
its
eccentric
way
until
at
last
its
white
sail
was
lost
to
sight
against
the
larger
bulk
of
the
fruiter
side
that
old
mellinger
explained
keogh
dropping
back
into
his
chair
he
going
back
to
new
york
he
was
private
secretary
of
the
late
president
of
this
grocery
and
fruit
stand
that
they
call
a
country
his
job
over
now
and
i
guess
old
mellinger
is
glad
why
does
he
disappear
to
music
like
the
magic
queen
asked
johnny
just
to
show
that
he
does
care
that
noise
you
heard
is
a
phonograph
said
keogh
i
sold
him
that
mellinger
had
a
graft
in
this
country
that
was
the
only
thing
of
its
kind
in
the
world
the
tooting
machine
saved
it
for
him
once
and
he
always
carried
it
around
with
him
afterward
tell
me
about
it
demanded
johnny
betraying
interest
i
no
disseminator
of
narratives
said
keogh
i
can
use
language
for
purposes
of
speech
but
when
i
attempt
a
discourse
the
words
come
out
as
they
will
and
they
may
make
sense
when
they
strike
the
atmosphere
or
they
may
not
i
want
to
hear
about
that
graft
persisted
johnny
you
got
no
right
to
refuse
i
told
you
all
about
every
man
woman
and
hitching
post
in
dalesburg
you
shall
hear
it
said
keogh
i
said
my
instincts
of
narrative
were
perplexed
do
you
believe
it
it
an
art
i
acquired
along
with
many
other
of
the
graces
and
sciences
vi
the
phonograph
and
the
graft
what
was
this
graft
asked
johnny
with
the
impatience
of
the
great
public
to
whom
tales
are
told
is
contrary
to
art
and
philosophy
to
give
you
the
information
said
keogh
calmly
the
art
of
narrative
consists
in
concealing
from
your
audience
everything
it
wants
to
know
until
after
you
expose
your
favourite
opinions
on
topics
foreign
to
the
subject
a
good
story
is
like
a
bitter
pill
with
the
sugar
coating
inside
of
it
i
will
begin
if
you
please
with
a
horoscope
located
in
the
cherokee
nation
and
end
with
a
moral
tune
on
the
phonograph
me
and
henry
horsecollar
brought
the
first
phonograph
to
this
country
henry
was
a
cherokee
educated
east
in
the
idioms
of
football
and
west
in
contraband
whisky
and
a
gentleman
the
same
as
you
and
me
he
was
easy
and
romping
in
his
ways
a
man
about
six
foot
with
a
kind
of
movement
yes
he
was
a
little
man
about
five
foot
five
or
five
foot
eleven
he
was
what
you
would
call
a
medium
tall
man
of
average
smallness
henry
had
quit
college
once
and
the
muscogee
jail
three
times
the
institution
on
account
of
introducing
and
selling
whisky
in
the
territories
henry
horsecollar
never
let
any
cigar
stores
come
up
and
stand
behind
him
he
did
belong
to
that
tribe
of
indians
henry
and
me
met
at
texarkana
and
figured
out
this
phonograph
scheme
he
had
which
came
to
him
out
of
a
land
allotment
in
the
reservation
i
had
run
down
from
little
rock
on
account
of
a
distressful
scene
i
had
witnessed
on
the
street
there
a
man
stood
on
a
box
and
passed
around
some
gold
watches
screw
case
elgin
movement
very
elegant
twenty
bucks
they
cost
you
over
the
counter
at
three
dollars
the
crowd
fought
for
the
tickers
the
man
happened
to
find
a
valise
full
of
them
handy
and
he
passed
them
out
like
putting
hot
biscuits
on
a
plate
the
backs
were
hard
to
unscrew
but
the
crowd
put
its
ear
to
the
case
and
they
ticked
mollifying
and
agreeable
three
of
these
watches
were
genuine
tickers
the
rest
were
only
kickers
hey
why
empty
cases
with
one
of
them
horny
black
bugs
that
fly
around
electric
lights
in
them
bugs
kick
off
minutes
and
seconds
industrious
and
beautiful
so
this
man
i
was
speaking
of
cleaned
up
and
then
he
went
away
because
he
knew
that
when
it
came
time
to
wind
watches
in
little
rock
an
entomologist
would
be
needed
and
he
was
one
so
as
i
say
henry
had
and
i
had
the
idea
of
introducing
the
phonograph
to
south
america
was
henry
but
i
took
to
it
freely
being
fond
of
machinery
of
all
kinds
latin
races
says
henry
explaining
easy
in
the
idioms
he
learned
at
college
peculiarly
adapted
to
be
victims
of
the
phonograph
they
have
the
artistic
temperament
they
yearn
for
music
and
color
and
gaiety
they
give
wampum
to
the
man
and
the
chicken
in
the
tent
when
they
months
behind
with
the
grocery
and
the
tree
says
i
export
canned
music
to
the
latins
but
mindful
of
julius
cæsar
account
of
where
he
says
gallia
in
tres
partes
divisa
which
is
the
same
as
to
say
we
will
need
all
of
our
gall
in
devising
means
to
tree
them
parties
i
hated
to
make
a
show
of
education
but
i
was
disinclined
to
be
overdone
in
syntax
by
a
mere
indian
a
member
of
a
race
to
which
we
owe
nothing
except
the
land
on
which
the
united
states
is
situated
we
bought
a
fine
phonograph
in
texarkana
one
of
the
best
make
and
half
a
trunkful
of
records
we
packed
up
and
took
the
and
for
new
orleans
from
that
celebrated
centre
of
molasses
and
disfranchised
coon
songs
we
took
a
steamer
for
south
america
we
landed
at
solitas
forty
miles
up
the
coast
from
here
was
a
palatable
enough
place
to
look
at
the
houses
were
clean
and
white
and
to
look
at
stuck
around
among
the
scenery
they
reminded
you
of
eggs
served
with
lettuce
there
was
a
block
of
skyscraper
mountains
in
the
suburbs
and
they
kept
pretty
quiet
like
they
had
crept
up
there
and
were
watching
the
town
and
the
sea
was
remarking
on
the
beach
and
now
and
then
a
ripe
cocoanut
would
drop
kerblip
in
the
sand
and
that
was
all
there
was
doing
yes
i
judge
that
town
was
considerably
on
the
quiet
i
judge
that
after
gabriel
quits
blowing
his
horn
and
the
car
starts
with
philadelphia
swinging
to
the
last
strap
and
pine
gully
arkansas
hanging
onto
the
rear
step
this
town
of
solitas
will
wake
up
and
ask
if
anybody
spoke
the
captain
went
ashore
with
us
and
offered
to
conduct
what
he
seemed
to
like
to
call
the
obsequies
he
introduced
henry
and
me
to
the
united
states
consul
and
a
roan
man
the
head
of
the
department
of
mercenary
and
licentious
dispositions
the
way
it
read
upon
his
sign
touch
here
again
a
week
from
says
the
captain
that
time
we
told
him
be
amassing
wealth
in
the
interior
towns
with
our
galvanized
prima
donna
and
correct
imitations
of
sousa
band
excavating
a
march
from
a
tin
mine
not
says
the
captain
be
hypnotized
any
gentleman
in
the
audience
who
kindly
steps
upon
the
stage
and
looks
this
country
in
the
eye
will
be
converted
to
the
hypothesis
that
he
but
a
fly
in
the
elgin
creamery
ye
be
standing
knee
deep
in
the
surf
waiting
for
me
and
your
machine
for
making
hamburger
steak
out
of
the
hitherto
respected
art
of
music
will
be
playing
there
no
place
like
home
henry
skinned
a
twenty
off
his
roll
and
received
from
the
bureau
of
mercenary
dispositions
a
paper
bearing
a
red
seal
and
a
dialect
story
and
no
change
then
we
got
the
consul
full
of
red
wine
and
struck
him
for
a
horoscope
he
was
a
thin
youngish
kind
of
man
i
should
say
past
fifty
sort
of
in
his
affections
and
puffed
up
with
disconsolation
yes
he
was
a
flattened
kind
of
a
man
in
whom
drink
lay
stagnant
inclined
to
corpulence
and
misery
yes
i
think
he
was
a
kind
of
dutchman
being
very
sad
and
genial
in
his
ways
marvelous
invention
he
says
the
phonograph
has
never
invaded
these
shores
the
people
have
never
heard
it
they
would
not
believe
it
if
they
should
children
of
nature
progress
has
never
condemned
them
to
accept
the
work
of
a
as
an
overture
and
might
incite
them
to
a
bloody
revolution
but
you
can
try
the
experiment
the
best
chance
you
have
is
that
the
populace
may
not
wake
up
when
you
play
there
two
ways
says
the
consul
may
take
it
they
may
become
inebriated
with
attention
like
an
atlanta
colonel
listening
to
marching
through
georgia
or
they
will
get
excited
and
transpose
the
key
of
the
music
with
an
axe
and
yourselves
into
a
dungeon
in
the
latter
case
says
the
consul
do
my
duty
by
cabling
to
the
state
department
and
i
wrap
the
stars
and
stripes
around
you
when
you
come
to
be
shot
and
threaten
them
with
the
vengeance
of
the
greatest
gold
export
and
financial
reserve
nation
on
earth
the
flag
is
full
of
bullet
holes
now
says
the
consul
in
that
way
twice
before
says
the
consul
have
cabled
our
government
for
a
couple
of
gunboats
to
protect
american
citizens
the
first
time
the
department
sent
me
a
pair
of
gum
boots
the
other
time
was
when
a
man
named
pease
was
going
to
be
executed
here
they
referred
that
appeal
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
let
us
now
disturb
the
señor
behind
the
bar
for
a
subsequence
of
the
red
wine
thus
soliloquized
the
consul
of
solitas
to
me
and
henry
horsecollar
but
notwithstanding
we
hired
a
room
that
afternoon
in
the
calle
de
los
angeles
the
main
street
that
runs
along
the
shore
and
put
our
trunks
there
was
a
room
dark
and
cheerful
but
small
was
on
a
various
street
diversified
by
houses
and
conservatory
plants
the
peasantry
of
the
city
passed
to
and
fro
on
the
fine
pasturage
between
the
sidewalks
was
for
the
world
like
an
opera
chorus
when
the
royal
kafoozlum
is
about
to
enter
we
were
rubbing
the
dust
off
the
machine
and
getting
fixed
to
start
business
the
next
day
when
a
big
white
man
in
white
clothes
stopped
at
the
door
and
looked
in
we
extended
the
invitations
and
he
walked
inside
and
sized
us
up
he
was
chewing
a
long
cigar
and
wrinkling
his
eyes
meditative
like
a
girl
trying
to
decide
which
dress
to
wear
to
the
party
york
he
says
to
me
finally
and
from
time
to
time
i
says
it
rubbed
off
yet
simple
says
he
you
know
how
it
the
fit
of
the
vest
they
do
cut
vests
right
anywhere
else
coats
maybe
but
not
vests
the
white
man
looks
at
henry
horsecollar
and
hesitates
says
henry
injun
says
the
man
mellinger
boys
confiscated
you
babes
in
the
wood
without
a
chaperon
or
referee
and
it
my
duty
to
start
you
going
i
knock
out
the
props
and
launch
you
proper
in
the
pellucid
waters
of
this
tropical
mud
puddle
you
have
to
be
christened
and
if
you
come
with
me
i
break
a
bottle
of
wine
across
your
bows
according
to
hoyle
well
for
two
days
homer
mellinger
did
the
honors
that
man
cut
ice
in
anchuria
he
was
it
he
was
the
royal
kafoozlum
if
me
and
henry
was
babes
in
the
wood
he
was
a
robin
redbreast
from
the
topmost
bough
him
and
me
and
henry
horsecollar
locked
arms
and
toted
that
phonograph
around
and
had
wassail
and
diversions
everywhere
we
found
doors
open
we
went
inside
and
set
the
machine
going
and
mellinger
called
upon
the
people
to
observe
the
artful
music
and
his
two
lifelong
friends
the
señors
americanos
the
opera
chorus
was
agitated
with
esteem
and
followed
us
from
house
to
house
there
was
a
different
kind
of
drink
to
be
had
with
every
tune
the
natives
had
acquirements
of
a
pleasant
thing
in
the
way
of
a
drink
that
gums
itself
to
the
recollection
they
chop
off
the
end
of
a
green
cocoanut
and
pour
in
on
the
juice
of
it
french
brandy
and
other
adjuvants
we
had
them
and
other
things
mine
and
henry
money
was
counterfeit
everything
was
on
homer
mellinger
that
man
could
find
rolls
of
bills
concealed
in
places
on
his
person
where
hermann
the
wizard
could
have
conjured
out
a
rabbit
or
an
omelette
he
could
have
founded
universities
and
made
orchid
collections
and
then
had
enough
left
to
purchase
the
colored
vote
of
his
country
henry
and
me
wondered
what
his
graft
was
one
evening
he
told
us
said
he
deceived
you
you
think
i
a
painted
butterfly
but
in
fact
i
the
hardest
worked
man
in
this
country
ten
years
ago
i
landed
on
its
shores
and
two
years
ago
on
the
point
of
its
jaw
yes
i
guess
i
can
get
the
decision
over
this
ginger
cake
commonwealth
at
the
end
of
any
round
i
choose
i
confide
in
you
because
you
are
my
countrymen
and
guests
even
if
you
have
assaulted
my
adopted
shores
with
the
worst
system
of
noises
ever
set
to
music
job
is
private
secretary
to
the
president
of
this
republic
and
my
duties
are
running
it
i
not
headlined
in
the
bills
but
i
the
mustard
in
the
salad
dressing
just
the
same
there
is
a
law
goes
before
congress
there
is
a
concession
granted
there
is
an
import
duty
levied
but
what
mellinger
he
cooks
and
seasons
it
in
the
front
office
i
fill
the
president
inkstand
and
search
visiting
statesmen
for
dirks
and
dynamite
but
in
the
back
room
i
dictate
the
policy
of
the
government
you
never
guess
in
the
world
how
i
got
my
pull
it
the
only
graft
of
its
kind
on
earth
i
put
you
wise
you
remember
the
old
in
the
copy
book
honesty
is
the
best
policy
that
it
i
working
honesty
for
a
graft
the
only
honest
man
in
the
republic
the
government
knows
it
the
people
know
it
the
boodlers
know
it
the
foreign
investors
know
it
i
make
the
government
keep
its
faith
if
a
man
is
promised
a
job
he
gets
it
if
outside
capital
buys
a
concession
it
gets
the
goods
i
run
a
monopoly
of
square
dealing
here
there
no
competition
if
colonel
diogenes
were
to
flash
his
lantern
in
this
precinct
he
have
my
address
inside
of
two
minutes
there
is
big
money
in
it
but
it
a
sure
thing
and
lets
a
man
sleep
of
nights
thus
homer
mellinger
made
oration
to
me
and
henry
horsecollar
and
later
he
divested
himself
of
this
remark
i
to
hold
a
this
evening
with
a
gang
of
leading
citizens
and
i
want
your
assistance
you
bring
the
musical
corn
sheller
and
give
the
affair
the
outside
appearance
of
a
function
there
important
business
on
hand
but
it
must
show
i
can
talk
to
you
people
i
been
pained
for
years
on
account
of
not
having
anybody
to
blow
off
and
brag
to
i
get
homesick
sometimes
and
swap
the
entire
perquisites
of
office
for
just
one
hour
to
have
a
stein
and
a
caviare
sandwich
somewhere
on
street
and
stand
and
watch
the
street
cars
go
by
and
smell
the
peanut
roaster
at
old
giuseppe
fruit
stand
said
i
fine
caviare
at
billy
renfrew
café
corner
of
and
knows
it
interrupts
mellinger
if
you
told
me
you
knew
billy
renfrew
i
have
invented
tons
of
ways
of
making
you
happy
billy
was
my
in
new
york
there
is
a
man
who
never
knew
what
crooked
was
here
i
am
working
honesty
for
a
graft
but
that
man
loses
money
on
it
carrambos
i
get
sick
at
times
of
this
country
everything
rotten
from
the
executive
down
to
the
coffee
pickers
they
plotting
to
down
each
other
and
skin
their
friends
if
a
mule
driver
takes
off
his
hat
to
an
official
that
man
figures
it
out
that
he
a
popular
idol
and
sets
his
pegs
to
stir
up
a
revolution
and
upset
the
administration
it
one
of
my
little
chores
as
private
secretary
to
smell
out
these
revolutions
and
affix
the
kibosh
before
they
break
out
and
scratch
the
paint
off
the
government
property
that
why
i
down
here
now
in
this
mildewed
coast
town
the
governor
of
the
district
and
his
crew
are
plotting
to
uprise
got
every
one
of
their
names
and
they
invited
to
listen
to
the
phonograph
compliments
of
that
the
way
i
get
them
in
a
bunch
and
things
are
on
the
programme
to
happen
to
them
we
three
were
sitting
at
table
in
the
cantina
of
the
purified
saints
mellinger
poured
out
wine
and
was
looking
some
worried
i
was
thinking
a
sharp
crowd
he
says
kind
of
fretful
capitalized
by
a
foreign
syndicate
after
rubber
and
they
loaded
to
the
muzzle
for
bribing
i
sick
goes
on
mellinger
comic
opera
i
want
to
smell
east
river
and
wear
suspenders
again
at
times
i
feel
like
throwing
up
my
job
but
i
d
n
fool
enough
to
be
sort
of
proud
of
it
there
mellinger
they
say
here
dios
you
ca
touch
him
with
a
million
i
like
to
take
that
record
back
and
show
it
to
billy
renfrow
some
day
and
that
tightens
my
grip
whenever
i
see
a
fat
thing
that
i
could
corral
just
by
winking
one
eye
and
losing
my
graft
by
they
ca
monkey
with
me
they
know
it
what
money
i
get
i
make
honest
and
spend
it
some
day
make
a
pile
and
go
back
and
eat
caviare
with
billy
show
you
how
to
handle
a
bunch
of
corruptionists
i
show
them
what
mellinger
private
secretary
means
when
you
spell
it
with
the
cotton
and
tissue
paper
off
mellinger
appears
shaky
and
breaks
his
glass
against
the
neck
of
the
bottle
i
says
to
myself
man
if
i
not
mistaken
there
been
a
bait
laid
out
where
the
tail
of
your
eye
could
see
it
that
night
according
to
arrangements
me
and
henry
took
the
phonograph
to
a
room
in
a
house
in
a
dirty
side
street
where
the
grass
was
knee
high
was
a
long
room
lit
with
smoky
oil
lamps
there
was
plenty
of
chairs
and
a
table
at
the
back
end
we
set
the
phonograph
on
the
table
mellinger
was
there
walking
up
and
down
disturbed
in
his
predicaments
he
chewed
cigars
and
spat
out
and
he
bit
the
thumb
nail
of
his
left
hand
by
and
by
the
invitations
to
the
musicale
came
sliding
in
by
pairs
and
threes
and
spade
flushes
their
colour
was
of
a
diversity
running
from
a
smoked
meerschaum
to
a
polish
they
were
as
polite
as
wax
being
devastated
with
enjoyments
to
give
señor
mellinger
the
good
evenings
i
understood
their
spanish
talk
i
ran
a
pumping
engine
two
years
in
a
mexican
silver
mine
and
had
it
pat
but
i
never
let
on
maybe
fifty
of
had
come
and
was
seated
when
in
slid
the
king
bee
the
governor
of
the
district
mellinger
met
him
at
the
door
and
escorted
him
to
the
grand
stand
when
i
saw
that
latin
man
i
knew
that
mellinger
private
secretary
had
all
the
dances
on
his
card
taken
that
was
a
big
squashy
man
the
colour
of
a
rubber
overshoe
and
he
had
an
eye
like
a
head
waiter
mellinger
explained
fluent
in
the
castilian
idioms
that
his
soul
was
disconcerted
with
joy
at
introducing
to
his
respected
friends
america
greatest
invention
the
wonder
of
the
age
henry
got
the
cue
and
run
on
an
elegant
record
and
the
festivities
became
initiated
the
governor
man
had
a
bit
of
english
under
his
hat
and
when
the
music
was
choked
off
he
says
fine
the
american
gentleemen
the
so
esplendeed
moosic
as
to
playee
the
table
was
a
long
one
and
henry
and
me
sat
at
the
end
of
it
next
the
wall
the
governor
sat
at
the
other
end
homer
mellinger
stood
at
the
side
of
it
i
was
just
wondering
how
mellinger
was
going
to
handle
his
crowd
when
the
home
talent
suddenly
opened
the
services
that
governor
man
was
suitable
for
uprisings
and
policies
i
judge
he
was
a
ready
kind
of
man
who
took
his
own
time
yes
he
was
full
of
attention
and
immediateness
he
leaned
his
hands
on
the
table
and
imposed
his
face
toward
the
secretary
man
the
american
señors
understand
spanish
he
asks
in
his
native
accents
do
not
says
mellinger
listen
goes
on
the
latin
man
prompt
musics
are
of
sufficient
prettiness
but
not
of
necessity
let
us
speak
of
business
i
well
know
why
we
are
here
since
i
observe
my
compatriots
you
had
a
whisper
yesterday
señor
mellinger
of
our
proposals
we
will
speak
out
we
know
that
you
stand
in
the
president
favour
and
we
know
your
influence
the
government
will
be
changed
we
know
the
worth
of
your
services
we
esteem
your
friendship
and
aid
so
much
that
mellinger
raises
his
hand
but
the
governor
man
bottles
him
up
not
speak
until
i
have
done
the
governor
man
then
draws
a
package
wrapped
in
paper
from
his
pocket
and
lays
it
on
the
table
by
mellinger
hand
that
you
will
find
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
money
of
your
country
you
can
do
nothing
against
us
but
you
can
be
worth
that
for
us
go
back
to
the
capital
and
obey
our
instructions
take
that
money
now
we
trust
you
you
will
find
with
it
a
paper
giving
in
detail
the
work
you
will
be
expected
to
do
for
us
do
not
have
the
unwiseness
to
refuse
the
governor
man
paused
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
mellinger
full
of
expressions
and
observances
i
looked
at
mellinger
and
was
glad
billy
renfrew
could
see
him
then
the
sweat
was
popping
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
stood
dumb
tapping
the
little
package
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
the
gang
was
after
his
graft
he
had
only
to
change
his
politics
and
stuff
five
fingers
in
his
inside
pocket
henry
whispers
to
me
and
wants
the
pause
in
the
programme
interpreted
i
whisper
back
is
up
against
a
bribe
size
and
the
coons
have
got
him
going
i
saw
mellinger
hand
moving
closer
to
the
package
weakening
i
whispered
to
henry
remind
him
says
henry
the
on
street
new
york
henry
stooped
down
and
got
a
record
from
the
basketful
we
brought
slid
it
in
the
phonograph
and
started
her
off
it
was
a
cornet
solo
very
neat
and
beautiful
and
the
name
of
it
was
sweet
home
not
one
of
them
fifty
odd
men
in
the
room
moved
while
it
was
playing
and
the
governor
man
kept
his
eyes
steady
on
mellinger
i
saw
mellinger
head
go
up
little
by
little
and
his
hand
came
creeping
away
from
the
package
not
until
the
last
note
sounded
did
anybody
stir
and
then
homer
mellinger
takes
up
the
bundle
of
boodle
and
slams
it
in
the
governor
man
face
my
answer
says
mellinger
private
secretary
be
another
in
the
morning
i
have
proofs
of
conspiracy
against
every
man
of
you
the
show
is
over
gentlemen
one
more
act
puts
in
the
governor
man
are
a
servant
i
believe
employed
by
the
president
to
copy
letters
and
answer
raps
at
the
door
i
am
governor
here
i
call
upon
you
in
the
name
of
the
cause
to
seize
this
man
that
brindled
gang
of
conspirators
shoved
back
their
chairs
and
advanced
in
force
i
could
see
where
mellinger
had
made
a
mistake
in
massing
his
enemy
so
as
to
make
a
play
i
think
he
made
another
one
too
but
we
can
pass
that
mellinger
idea
of
a
graft
and
mine
being
different
according
to
estimations
and
points
of
view
there
was
only
one
window
and
door
in
that
room
and
they
were
in
the
front
end
here
was
fifty
odd
latin
men
coming
in
a
bunch
to
obstruct
the
legislation
of
mellinger
you
may
say
there
were
three
of
us
for
me
and
henry
simultaneous
declared
new
york
city
and
the
cherokee
nation
in
sympathy
with
the
weaker
party
then
it
was
that
henry
horsecollar
rose
to
a
point
of
disorder
and
intervened
showing
admirable
the
advantages
of
education
as
applied
to
the
american
indian
natural
intellect
and
native
refinement
he
stood
up
and
smoothed
back
his
hair
on
each
side
with
his
hands
as
you
have
seen
little
girls
do
when
they
play
behind
me
both
of
you
says
henry
it
to
be
chief
i
asked
going
to
buck
centre
says
henry
in
his
football
idioms
is
a
tackle
in
the
lot
of
them
follow
me
close
and
rush
the
game
then
that
cultured
red
man
exhaled
an
arrangement
of
sounds
with
his
mouth
that
made
the
latin
aggregation
pause
with
thoughtfulness
and
hesitations
the
matter
of
his
proclamation
seemed
to
be
a
of
the
carlisle
with
the
cherokee
college
yell
he
went
at
the
chocolate
team
like
a
bean
out
of
a
little
nigger
shooter
his
right
elbow
laid
out
the
governor
man
on
the
gridiron
and
he
made
a
lane
the
length
of
the
crowd
so
wide
that
a
woman
could
have
carried
a
through
it
without
striking
against
anything
all
mellinger
and
me
had
to
do
was
to
follow
it
took
us
just
three
minutes
to
get
out
of
that
street
around
to
military
headquarters
where
mellinger
had
things
his
own
way
a
colonel
and
a
battalion
of
infantry
turned
out
and
went
back
to
the
scene
of
the
musicale
with
us
but
the
conspirator
gang
was
gone
but
we
recaptured
the
phonograph
with
honours
of
war
and
marched
back
to
the
with
it
playing
coons
look
alike
to
me
the
next
day
mellinger
takes
me
and
henry
to
one
side
and
begins
to
shed
tens
and
twenties
want
to
buy
that
phonograph
says
he
liked
that
last
tune
it
played
at
the
is
more
money
than
the
machine
is
worth
says
i
government
expense
money
says
mellinger
government
pays
for
it
and
it
getting
the
cheap
me
and
henry
knew
that
pretty
well
we
knew
that
it
had
saved
homer
mellinger
graft
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
losing
it
but
we
never
let
him
know
we
knew
it
you
boys
better
slide
off
further
down
the
coast
for
a
while
says
mellinger
i
get
the
screws
put
on
these
fellows
here
if
you
do
they
give
you
trouble
and
if
you
ever
happen
to
see
billy
renfrew
again
before
i
do
tell
him
i
coming
back
to
new
york
as
soon
as
i
can
make
a
stake
honest
me
and
henry
laid
low
until
the
day
the
steamer
came
back
when
we
saw
the
captain
boat
on
the
beach
we
went
down
and
stood
in
the
edge
of
the
water
the
captain
grinned
when
he
saw
us
told
you
you
be
waiting
he
says
the
hamburger
machine
stays
behind
i
says
play
home
sweet
home
told
you
so
says
the
captain
again
in
the
boat
and
that
said
keogh
is
the
way
me
and
henry
horsecollar
introduced
the
phonograph
into
this
country
henry
went
back
to
the
states
but
i
been
rummaging
around
in
the
tropics
ever
since
they
say
mellinger
never
travelled
a
mile
after
that
without
his
phonograph
i
guess
it
kept
him
reminded
about
his
graft
whenever
he
saw
the
siren
voice
of
the
boodler
tip
him
the
wink
with
a
bribe
in
its
hand
i
suppose
he
taking
it
home
with
him
as
a
souvenir
remarked
the
consul
not
as
a
souvenir
said
keogh
he
need
two
of
in
new
york
running
day
and
night
vii
money
maze
the
new
administration
of
anchuria
entered
upon
its
duties
and
privileges
with
enthusiasm
its
first
act
was
to
send
an
agent
to
coralio
with
imperative
orders
to
recover
if
possible
the
sum
of
money
ravished
from
the
treasury
by
the
miraflores
colonel
emilio
falcon
the
private
secretary
of
losada
the
new
president
was
despatched
from
the
capital
upon
this
important
mission
the
position
of
private
secretary
to
a
tropical
president
is
a
responsible
one
he
must
be
a
diplomat
a
spy
a
ruler
of
men
a
to
his
chief
and
a
of
plots
and
nascent
revolutions
often
he
is
the
power
behind
the
throne
the
dictator
of
policy
and
a
president
chooses
him
with
a
dozen
times
the
care
with
which
he
selects
a
matrimonial
mate
colonel
falcon
a
handsome
and
urbane
gentleman
of
castilian
courtesy
and
débonnaire
manners
came
to
coralio
with
the
task
before
him
of
striking
upon
the
cold
trail
of
the
lost
money
there
he
conferred
with
the
military
authorities
who
had
received
instructions
to
with
him
in
the
search
colonel
falcon
established
his
headquarters
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
casa
morena
here
for
a
week
he
held
informal
sittings
much
as
if
he
were
a
kind
of
unified
grand
jury
and
summoned
before
him
all
those
whose
testimony
might
illumine
the
financial
tragedy
that
had
accompanied
the
less
momentous
one
of
the
late
president
death
two
or
three
who
were
thus
examined
among
whom
was
the
barber
estebán
declared
that
they
had
identified
the
body
of
the
president
before
its
burial
of
a
truth
testified
estebán
before
the
mighty
secretary
it
was
he
the
president
consider
how
could
i
shave
a
man
and
not
see
his
face
he
sent
for
me
to
shave
him
in
a
small
house
he
had
a
beard
very
black
and
thick
had
i
ever
seen
the
president
before
why
not
i
saw
him
once
ride
forth
in
a
carriage
from
the
in
solitas
when
i
shaved
him
he
gave
me
a
gold
piece
and
said
there
was
to
be
no
talk
but
i
am
a
liberal
i
am
devoted
to
my
country
and
i
spake
of
these
things
to
señor
goodwin
it
is
known
said
colonel
falcon
smoothly
that
the
late
president
took
with
him
an
american
leather
valise
containing
a
large
amount
of
money
did
you
see
that
no
estebán
answered
the
light
in
the
little
house
was
but
a
small
lamp
by
which
i
could
scarcely
see
to
shave
the
president
such
a
thing
there
may
have
been
but
i
did
not
see
it
no
also
in
the
room
was
a
young
lady
a
señorita
of
much
beauty
that
i
could
see
even
in
so
small
a
light
but
the
money
señor
or
the
thing
in
which
it
was
carried
that
i
did
not
see
the
and
other
officers
gave
testimony
that
they
had
been
awakened
and
alarmed
by
the
noise
of
a
in
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
hurrying
thither
to
protect
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
republic
they
found
a
man
lying
dead
with
a
pistol
clutched
in
his
hand
beside
him
was
a
young
woman
weeping
sorely
señor
goodwin
was
also
in
the
room
when
they
entered
it
but
of
the
valise
of
money
they
saw
nothing
madame
timotea
ortiz
the
proprietress
of
the
hotel
in
which
the
game
of
had
been
played
out
told
of
the
coming
of
the
two
guests
to
her
house
to
my
house
they
came
said
she
one
not
quite
old
and
one
of
sufficient
handsomeness
they
desired
not
to
eat
or
to
drink
not
even
of
my
which
is
the
best
to
their
rooms
they
ascended
and
later
came
señor
goodwin
who
ascended
to
speak
with
them
then
i
heard
a
great
noise
like
that
of
a
and
they
said
that
the
had
shot
himself
i
saw
nothing
of
money
or
of
the
thing
you
call
that
you
say
he
carried
it
in
colonel
falcon
soon
came
to
the
reasonable
conclusion
that
if
anyone
in
coralio
could
furnish
a
clue
to
the
vanished
money
frank
goodwin
must
be
the
man
but
the
wise
secretary
pursued
a
different
course
in
seeking
information
from
the
american
goodwin
was
a
powerful
friend
to
the
new
administration
and
one
who
was
not
to
be
carelessly
dealt
with
in
respect
to
either
his
honesty
or
his
courage
even
the
private
secretary
of
his
excellency
hesitated
to
have
this
rubber
prince
and
mahogany
baron
haled
before
him
as
a
common
citizen
of
anchuria
so
he
sent
goodwin
a
flowery
epistle
each
dripping
with
honey
requesting
the
favour
of
an
interview
goodwin
replied
with
an
invitation
to
dinner
at
his
own
house
before
the
hour
named
the
american
walked
over
to
the
casa
morena
and
greeted
his
guest
frankly
and
friendly
then
the
two
strolled
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
to
goodwin
home
in
the
environs
the
american
left
colonel
falcon
in
a
big
cool
shadowed
room
with
a
floor
of
inlaid
and
polished
woods
that
any
millionaire
in
the
states
would
have
envied
excusing
himself
for
a
few
minutes
he
crossed
a
shaded
with
deftly
arranged
awnings
and
plants
and
entered
a
long
room
looking
upon
the
sea
in
the
opposite
wing
of
the
house
the
broad
jalousies
were
opened
wide
and
the
ocean
breeze
flowed
in
through
the
room
an
invisible
current
of
coolness
and
health
goodwin
wife
sat
near
one
of
the
windows
making
a
sketch
of
the
afternoon
seascape
here
was
a
woman
who
looked
to
be
happy
and
more
she
looked
to
be
content
had
a
poet
been
inspired
to
pen
just
similes
concerning
her
favour
he
would
have
likened
her
full
clear
eyes
with
their
gray
irises
to
moonflowers
with
none
of
the
goddesses
whose
traditional
charms
have
become
coldly
classic
would
the
discerning
rhymester
have
compared
her
she
was
purely
paradisaic
not
olympian
if
you
can
imagine
eve
after
the
eviction
beguiling
the
flaming
warriors
and
serenely
the
garden
you
will
have
her
just
so
human
and
still
so
harmonious
with
eden
seemed
goodwin
when
her
husband
entered
she
looked
up
and
her
lips
curved
and
parted
her
eyelids
fluttered
twice
or
thrice
a
movement
remindful
poesy
forgive
us
of
the
of
a
faithful
dog
and
a
little
ripple
went
through
her
like
the
commotion
set
up
in
a
weeping
willow
by
a
puff
of
wind
thus
she
ever
acknowledged
his
coming
were
it
twenty
times
a
day
if
they
who
sometimes
sat
over
their
wine
in
coralio
reshaping
old
diverting
stories
of
the
madcap
career
of
isabel
guilbert
could
have
seen
the
wife
of
frank
goodwin
that
afternoon
in
the
estimable
aura
of
her
happy
wifehood
they
might
have
disbelieved
or
have
agreed
to
forget
those
graphic
annals
of
the
life
of
the
one
for
whom
their
president
gave
up
his
country
and
his
honour
i
have
brought
a
guest
to
dinner
said
goodwin
one
colonel
falcon
from
san
mateo
he
is
come
on
government
business
i
do
not
think
you
will
care
to
see
him
so
i
prescribe
for
you
one
of
those
convenient
and
indisputable
feminine
headaches
he
has
come
to
inquire
about
the
lost
money
has
he
not
asked
goodwin
going
on
with
her
sketch
a
good
guess
acknowledged
goodwin
he
has
been
holding
an
inquisition
among
the
natives
for
three
days
i
am
next
on
his
list
of
witnesses
but
as
he
feels
shy
about
dragging
one
of
uncle
subjects
before
him
he
consents
to
give
it
the
outward
appearance
of
a
social
function
he
will
apply
the
torture
over
my
own
wine
and
provender
has
he
found
anyone
who
saw
the
valise
of
money
not
a
soul
even
madama
ortiz
whose
eyes
are
so
sharp
for
the
sight
of
a
revenue
official
does
not
remember
that
there
was
any
baggage
goodwin
laid
down
her
brush
and
sighed
i
am
so
sorry
frank
she
said
that
they
are
giving
you
so
much
trouble
about
the
money
but
we
ca
let
them
know
about
it
can
we
not
without
doing
our
intelligence
a
great
injustice
said
goodwin
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
that
he
had
picked
up
from
the
natives
though
i
am
they
would
have
me
in
the
in
half
an
hour
if
they
knew
we
had
appropriated
that
valise
no
we
must
appear
as
ignorant
about
the
money
as
the
other
ignoramuses
in
coralio
do
you
think
that
this
man
they
have
sent
suspects
you
she
asked
with
a
little
pucker
of
her
brows
he
better
not
said
the
american
carelessly
it
lucky
that
no
one
caught
a
sight
of
the
valise
except
myself
as
i
was
in
the
rooms
when
the
shot
was
fired
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
should
want
to
investigate
my
part
in
the
affair
rather
closely
but
there
no
cause
for
alarm
this
colonel
is
down
on
the
list
of
events
for
a
good
dinner
with
a
dessert
of
american
that
will
end
the
matter
i
think
goodwin
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
goodwin
followed
and
stood
by
her
side
she
leaned
to
him
and
rested
in
the
protection
of
his
strength
as
she
had
always
rested
since
that
dark
night
on
which
he
had
first
made
himself
her
tower
of
refuge
thus
they
stood
for
a
little
while
straight
through
the
lavish
growth
of
tropical
branch
and
leaf
and
vine
that
confronted
them
had
been
cunningly
trimmed
a
vista
that
ended
at
the
cleared
environs
of
coralio
on
the
banks
of
the
mangrove
swamp
at
the
other
end
of
the
aerial
tunnel
they
could
see
the
grave
and
wooden
headpiece
that
bore
the
name
of
the
unhappy
president
miraflores
from
this
window
when
the
rains
forbade
the
open
and
from
the
green
and
shady
slopes
of
goodwin
fruitful
lands
when
the
skies
were
smiling
his
wife
was
wont
to
look
upon
that
grave
with
a
gentle
sadness
that
was
now
scarcely
a
mar
to
her
happiness
i
loved
him
so
frank
she
said
even
after
that
terrible
flight
and
its
awful
ending
and
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
and
have
made
me
so
happy
it
has
all
grown
into
such
a
strange
puzzle
if
they
were
to
find
out
that
we
got
the
money
do
you
think
they
would
force
you
to
make
the
amount
good
to
the
government
they
would
undoubtedly
try
answered
goodwin
you
are
right
about
its
being
a
puzzle
and
it
must
remain
a
puzzle
to
falcon
and
all
his
countrymen
until
it
solves
itself
you
and
i
who
know
more
than
anyone
else
only
know
half
of
the
solution
we
must
not
let
even
a
hint
about
this
money
get
abroad
let
them
come
to
the
theory
that
the
president
concealed
it
in
the
mountains
during
his
journey
or
that
he
found
means
to
ship
it
out
of
the
country
before
he
reached
coralio
i
do
think
that
falcon
suspects
me
he
is
making
a
close
investigation
according
to
his
orders
but
he
will
find
out
nothing
thus
they
spake
together
had
anyone
overheard
or
overseen
them
as
they
discussed
the
lost
funds
of
anchuria
there
would
have
been
a
second
puzzle
presented
for
upon
the
faces
and
in
the
bearing
of
each
of
them
was
visible
if
countenances
are
to
be
believed
saxon
honesty
and
pride
and
honourable
thoughts
in
goodwin
steady
eye
and
firm
lineaments
moulded
into
material
shape
by
the
inward
spirit
of
kindness
and
generosity
and
courage
there
was
nothing
reconcilable
with
his
words
as
for
his
wife
physiognomy
championed
her
even
in
the
face
of
their
accusive
talk
nobility
was
in
her
guise
purity
was
in
her
glance
the
devotion
that
she
manifested
had
not
even
the
appearance
of
that
feeling
that
now
and
then
inspires
a
woman
to
share
the
guilt
of
her
partner
out
of
the
pathetic
greatness
of
her
love
no
there
was
a
discrepancy
here
between
what
the
eye
would
have
seen
and
the
ear
have
heard
dinner
was
served
to
goodwin
and
his
guest
in
the
under
cool
foliage
and
flowers
the
american
begged
the
illustrious
secretary
to
excuse
the
absence
of
goodwin
who
was
suffering
he
said
from
a
headache
brought
on
by
a
slight
after
the
meal
they
lingered
according
to
the
custom
over
their
coffee
and
cigars
colonel
falcon
with
true
castilian
delicacy
waited
for
his
host
to
open
the
question
that
they
had
met
to
discuss
he
had
not
long
to
wait
as
soon
as
the
cigars
were
lighted
the
american
cleared
the
way
by
inquiring
whether
the
investigations
in
the
town
had
furnished
him
with
any
clue
to
the
lost
funds
i
have
found
no
one
yet
admitted
colonel
falcon
who
even
had
sight
of
the
valise
or
the
money
yet
i
have
persisted
it
has
been
proven
in
the
capital
that
president
miraflores
set
out
from
san
mateo
with
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
belonging
to
the
government
accompanied
by
isabel
guilbert
the
opera
singer
the
government
officially
and
personally
is
loathe
to
believe
concluded
colonel
falcon
with
a
smile
that
our
late
tastes
would
have
permitted
him
to
abandon
on
the
route
as
excess
baggage
either
of
the
desirable
articles
with
which
his
flight
was
burdened
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
about
the
affair
said
goodwin
coming
directly
to
the
point
it
will
not
require
many
words
on
that
night
with
others
of
our
friends
here
i
was
keeping
a
lookout
for
the
president
having
been
notified
of
his
flight
by
a
telegram
in
our
national
cipher
from
englehart
one
of
our
leaders
in
the
capital
about
ten
that
night
i
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
hurrying
along
the
streets
they
went
to
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
and
engaged
rooms
i
followed
them
upstairs
leaving
estebán
who
had
come
up
to
watch
outside
the
barber
had
told
me
that
he
had
shaved
the
beard
from
the
president
face
that
night
therefore
i
was
prepared
when
i
entered
the
rooms
to
find
him
with
a
smooth
face
when
i
apprehended
him
in
the
name
of
the
people
he
drew
a
pistol
and
shot
himself
instantly
in
a
few
minutes
many
officers
and
citizens
were
on
the
spot
i
suppose
you
have
been
informed
of
the
subsequent
facts
goodwin
paused
losada
agent
maintained
an
attitude
of
waiting
as
if
he
expected
a
continuance
and
now
went
on
the
american
looking
steadily
into
the
eyes
of
the
other
man
and
giving
each
word
a
deliberate
emphasis
you
will
oblige
me
by
attending
carefully
to
what
i
have
to
add
i
saw
no
valise
or
receptacle
of
any
kind
or
any
money
belonging
to
the
republic
of
anchuria
if
president
miraflores
decamped
with
any
funds
belonging
to
the
treasury
of
this
country
or
to
himself
or
to
anyone
else
i
saw
no
trace
of
it
in
the
house
or
elsewhere
at
that
time
or
at
any
other
does
that
statement
cover
the
ground
of
the
inquiry
you
wished
to
make
of
me
colonel
falcon
bowed
and
described
a
fluent
curve
with
his
cigar
his
duty
was
performed
goodwin
was
not
to
be
disputed
he
was
a
loyal
supporter
of
the
government
and
enjoyed
the
full
confidence
of
the
new
president
his
rectitude
had
been
the
capital
that
had
brought
him
fortune
in
anchuria
just
as
it
had
formed
the
lucrative
graft
of
mellinger
the
secretary
of
miraflores
i
thank
you
goodwin
said
falcon
for
speaking
plainly
your
word
will
be
sufficient
for
the
president
but
goodwin
i
am
instructed
to
pursue
every
clue
that
presents
itself
in
this
matter
there
is
one
that
i
have
not
yet
touched
upon
our
friends
in
france
have
a
saying
la
when
there
is
a
mystery
without
a
clue
but
here
we
do
not
have
to
search
the
woman
who
accompanied
the
late
president
in
his
flight
must
surely
i
must
interrupt
you
there
interposed
goodwin
it
is
true
that
when
i
entered
the
hotel
for
the
purpose
of
intercepting
president
miraflores
i
found
a
lady
there
i
must
beg
of
you
to
remember
that
that
lady
is
now
my
wife
i
speak
for
her
as
i
do
for
myself
she
knows
nothing
of
the
fate
of
the
valise
or
of
the
money
that
you
are
seeking
you
will
say
to
his
excellency
that
i
guarantee
her
innocence
i
do
not
need
to
add
to
you
colonel
falcon
that
i
do
not
care
to
have
her
questioned
or
disturbed
colonel
falcon
bowed
again
no
he
cried
and
to
indicate
that
the
inquiry
was
ended
he
added
and
now
let
me
beg
of
you
to
show
me
that
sea
view
from
your
of
which
you
spoke
i
am
a
lover
of
the
sea
in
the
early
evening
goodwin
walked
back
to
the
town
with
his
guest
leaving
him
at
the
corner
of
the
calle
grande
as
he
was
returning
homeward
one
beelzebub
blythe
with
the
air
of
a
courtier
and
the
outward
aspect
of
a
scarecrow
pounced
upon
him
hopefully
from
the
door
of
a
blythe
had
been
beelzebub
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
greatness
of
his
fall
once
in
some
distant
paradise
lost
he
had
foregathered
with
the
angels
of
the
earth
but
fate
had
hurled
him
headlong
down
to
the
tropics
where
flamed
in
his
bosom
a
fire
that
was
seldom
quenched
in
coralio
they
called
him
a
beachcomber
but
he
was
in
reality
a
categorical
idealist
who
strove
to
anamorphosize
the
dull
verities
of
life
by
the
means
of
brandy
and
rum
as
beelzebub
himself
might
have
held
in
his
clutch
with
unwitting
tenacity
his
harp
or
crown
during
his
tremendous
fall
so
his
namesake
had
clung
to
his
eyeglasses
as
the
only
souvenir
of
his
lost
estate
these
he
wore
with
impressiveness
and
distinction
while
he
combed
beaches
and
extracted
toll
from
his
friends
by
some
mysterious
means
he
kept
his
face
always
smoothly
shaven
for
the
rest
he
sponged
gracefully
upon
whomsoever
he
could
for
enough
to
keep
him
pretty
drunk
and
sheltered
from
the
rains
and
night
dews
hallo
goodwin
called
the
derelict
airily
i
was
hoping
strike
you
i
wanted
to
see
you
particularly
suppose
we
go
where
we
can
talk
of
course
you
know
there
a
chap
down
here
looking
up
the
money
old
miraflores
lost
yes
said
goodwin
i
been
talking
with
him
let
go
into
espada
place
i
can
spare
you
ten
minutes
they
went
into
the
and
sat
at
a
little
table
upon
stools
with
rawhide
tops
have
a
drink
said
goodwin
they
ca
bring
it
too
quickly
said
blythe
i
been
in
a
drought
ever
since
morning
hi
el
aguardiente
por
now
what
do
you
want
to
see
me
about
asked
goodwin
when
the
drinks
were
before
them
confound
it
old
man
drawled
blythe
why
do
you
spoil
a
golden
moment
like
this
with
business
i
wanted
to
see
you
well
this
has
the
preference
he
gulped
down
his
brandy
and
gazed
longingly
into
the
empty
glass
have
another
suggested
goodwin
between
gentlemen
said
the
fallen
angel
i
do
quite
like
your
use
of
that
word
it
is
quite
delicate
but
the
concrete
idea
that
the
word
represents
is
not
displeasing
the
glasses
were
refilled
blythe
sipped
blissfully
from
his
as
he
began
to
enter
the
state
of
a
true
idealist
i
must
trot
along
in
a
minute
or
two
hinted
goodwin
was
there
anything
in
particular
blythe
did
not
reply
at
once
old
losada
would
make
it
a
hot
country
he
remarked
at
length
for
the
man
who
swiped
that
gripsack
of
treasury
boodle
do
you
think
undoubtedly
he
would
agreed
goodwin
calmly
as
he
rose
leisurely
to
his
feet
i
be
running
over
to
the
house
now
old
man
goodwin
is
alone
there
was
nothing
important
you
had
to
say
was
there
that
all
said
blythe
unless
you
would
mind
sending
in
another
drink
from
the
bar
as
you
go
out
old
espada
has
closed
my
account
to
profit
and
loss
and
pay
for
the
lot
will
you
like
a
good
fellow
all
right
said
goodwin
beelzebub
blythe
lingered
over
his
cups
polishing
his
eyeglasses
with
a
disreputable
handkerchief
i
thought
i
could
do
it
but
i
could
he
muttered
to
himself
after
a
time
a
gentleman
ca
blackmail
the
man
that
he
drinks
with
viii
the
admiral
spilled
milk
draws
few
tears
from
an
anchurian
administration
many
are
its
lacteal
sources
and
the
clocks
hands
point
forever
to
milking
time
even
the
rich
cream
skimmed
from
the
treasury
by
the
bewitched
miraflores
did
not
cause
the
patriots
to
waste
time
in
unprofitable
regrets
the
government
philosophically
set
about
supplying
the
deficiency
by
increasing
the
import
duties
and
by
suggesting
to
wealthy
private
citizens
that
contributions
according
to
their
means
would
be
considered
patriotic
and
in
order
prosperity
was
expected
to
attend
the
reign
of
losada
the
new
president
the
ousted
and
military
favourites
organized
a
new
liberal
party
and
began
to
lay
their
plans
for
a
thus
the
game
of
anchurian
politics
began
like
a
chinese
comedy
to
unwind
slowly
its
serial
length
here
and
there
mirth
peeps
for
an
instant
from
the
wings
and
illumines
the
florid
lines
a
dozen
quarts
of
champagne
in
conjunction
with
an
informal
sitting
of
the
president
and
his
cabinet
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
navy
and
the
appointment
of
felipe
carrera
as
its
admiral
next
to
the
champagne
the
credit
of
the
appointment
belongs
to
don
sabas
placido
the
newly
confirmed
minister
of
war
the
president
had
requested
a
convention
of
his
cabinet
for
the
discussion
of
questions
politic
and
for
the
transaction
of
certain
routine
matters
of
state
the
session
had
been
signally
tedious
the
business
and
the
wine
prodigiously
dry
a
sudden
prankish
humour
of
don
sabas
impelling
him
to
the
deed
spiced
the
grave
affairs
of
state
with
a
whiff
of
agreeable
playfulness
in
the
dilatory
order
of
business
had
come
a
bulletin
from
the
coast
department
of
orilla
del
mar
reporting
the
seizure
by
the
officers
at
the
town
of
coralio
of
the
sloop
del
and
her
cargo
of
drygoods
patent
medicines
granulated
sugar
and
brandy
also
six
martini
rifles
and
a
barrel
of
american
whisky
caught
in
the
act
of
smuggling
the
sloop
with
its
cargo
was
now
according
to
law
the
property
of
the
republic
the
collector
of
customs
in
making
his
report
departed
from
the
conventional
forms
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
confiscated
vessel
be
converted
to
the
use
of
the
government
the
prize
was
the
first
capture
to
the
credit
of
the
department
in
ten
years
the
collector
took
opportunity
to
pat
his
department
on
the
back
it
often
happened
that
government
officers
required
transportation
from
point
to
point
along
the
coast
and
means
were
usually
lacking
furthermore
the
sloop
could
be
manned
by
a
loyal
crew
and
employed
as
a
coast
guard
to
discourage
the
pernicious
art
of
smuggling
the
collector
also
ventured
to
nominate
one
to
whom
the
charge
of
the
boat
could
be
safely
intrusted
a
young
man
of
coralio
felipe
carrera
not
be
it
understood
one
of
extreme
wisdom
but
loyal
and
the
best
sailor
along
the
coast
it
was
upon
this
hint
that
the
minister
of
war
acted
executing
a
rare
piece
of
drollery
that
so
enlivened
the
tedium
of
executive
session
in
the
constitution
of
this
small
maritime
banana
republic
was
a
forgotten
section
that
provided
for
the
maintenance
of
a
navy
this
provision
with
many
other
wiser
ones
had
lain
inert
since
the
establishment
of
the
republic
anchuria
had
no
navy
and
had
no
use
for
one
it
was
characteristic
of
don
sabas
a
man
at
once
merry
learned
whimsical
and
audacious
that
he
should
have
disturbed
the
dust
of
this
musty
and
sleeping
statute
to
increase
the
humour
of
the
world
by
so
much
as
a
smile
from
his
indulgent
colleagues
with
delightful
mock
seriousness
the
minister
of
war
proposed
the
creation
of
a
navy
he
argued
its
need
and
the
glories
it
might
achieve
with
such
gay
and
witty
zeal
that
the
travesty
overcame
with
its
humour
even
the
swart
dignity
of
president
losada
himself
the
champagne
was
bubbling
trickily
in
the
veins
of
the
mercurial
statesmen
it
was
not
the
custom
of
the
grave
governors
of
anchuria
to
enliven
their
sessions
with
a
beverage
so
apt
to
cast
a
veil
of
disparagement
over
sober
affairs
the
wine
had
been
a
thoughtful
compliment
tendered
by
the
agent
of
the
vesuvius
fruit
company
as
a
token
of
amicable
relations
and
certain
consummated
deals
between
that
company
and
the
republic
of
anchuria
the
jest
was
carried
to
its
end
a
formidable
official
document
was
prepared
encrusted
with
chromatic
seals
and
jaunty
with
fluttering
ribbons
bearing
the
florid
signatures
of
state
this
commission
conferred
upon
el
señor
don
felipe
carrera
the
title
of
flag
admiral
of
the
republic
of
anchuria
thus
within
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
and
the
dominion
of
a
dozen
extra
dry
the
country
took
its
place
among
the
naval
powers
of
the
world
and
felipe
carrera
became
entitled
to
a
salute
of
nineteen
guns
whenever
he
might
enter
port
the
southern
races
are
lacking
in
that
particular
kind
of
humour
that
finds
entertainment
in
the
defects
and
misfortunes
bestowed
by
nature
owing
to
this
defect
in
their
constitution
they
are
not
moved
to
laughter
as
are
their
northern
brothers
by
the
spectacle
of
the
deformed
the
or
the
insane
felipe
carrera
was
sent
upon
earth
with
but
half
his
wits
therefore
the
people
of
coralio
called
him
pobrecito
the
poor
little
crazed
one
saying
that
god
had
sent
but
half
of
him
to
earth
retaining
the
other
half
a
sombre
youth
glowering
and
speaking
only
at
the
rarest
times
felipe
was
but
negatively
loco
on
shore
he
generally
refused
all
conversation
he
seemed
to
know
that
he
was
badly
handicapped
on
land
where
so
many
kinds
of
understanding
are
needed
but
on
the
water
his
one
talent
set
him
equal
with
most
men
few
sailors
whom
god
had
carefully
and
completely
made
could
handle
a
sailboat
as
well
five
points
nearer
the
wind
than
even
the
best
of
them
he
could
sail
his
sloop
when
the
elements
raged
and
set
other
men
to
cowering
the
deficiencies
of
felipe
seemed
of
little
importance
he
was
a
perfect
sailor
if
an
imperfect
man
he
owned
no
boat
but
worked
among
the
crews
of
the
schooners
and
sloops
that
skimmed
the
coast
trading
and
freighting
fruit
out
to
the
steamers
where
there
was
no
harbour
it
was
through
his
famous
skill
and
boldness
on
the
sea
as
well
as
for
the
pity
felt
for
his
mental
imperfections
that
he
was
recommended
by
the
collector
as
a
suitable
custodian
of
the
captured
sloop
when
the
outcome
of
don
sabas
little
pleasantry
arrived
in
the
form
of
the
imposing
and
preposterous
commission
the
collector
smiled
he
had
not
expected
such
prompt
and
overwhelming
response
to
his
recommendation
he
despatched
a
at
once
to
fetch
the
future
admiral
the
collector
waited
in
his
official
quarters
his
office
was
in
the
calle
grande
and
the
sea
breezes
hummed
through
its
windows
all
day
the
collector
in
white
linen
and
canvas
shoes
philandered
with
papers
on
an
antique
desk
a
parrot
perched
on
a
pen
rack
seasoned
the
official
tedium
with
a
fire
of
choice
castilian
imprecations
two
rooms
opened
into
the
collector
in
one
the
clerical
force
of
young
men
of
variegated
complexions
transacted
with
glitter
and
parade
their
several
duties
through
the
open
door
of
the
other
room
could
be
seen
a
bronze
babe
guiltless
of
clothing
that
rollicked
upon
the
floor
in
a
grass
hammock
a
thin
woman
tinted
a
pale
lemon
played
a
guitar
and
swung
contentedly
in
the
breeze
thus
surrounded
by
the
routine
of
his
high
duties
and
the
visible
tokens
of
agreeable
domesticity
the
collector
heart
was
further
made
happy
by
the
power
placed
in
his
hands
to
brighten
the
fortunes
of
the
innocent
felipe
felipe
came
and
stood
before
the
collector
he
was
a
lad
of
twenty
not
in
looks
but
with
an
expression
of
distant
and
pondering
vacuity
he
wore
white
cotton
trousers
down
the
seams
of
which
he
had
sewed
red
stripes
with
some
vague
aim
at
military
decoration
a
flimsy
blue
shirt
fell
open
at
his
throat
his
feet
were
bare
he
held
in
his
hand
the
cheapest
of
straw
hats
from
the
states

the

gravely

the
showy

felipe
that
we

no
navy
but
yes

sloop
the
del
that
my
brave
men
captured
from
the
coast
smugglers
is
to
be
placed

the
services
of

at
all
times
to
convey
officials
of
the
government
to
points
along
the
coast
where
they
may
be
obliged
to
visit

will
also
act
as
a

prevent
as
far
as
you
may
be
able
the
crime
of
smuggling

will
uphold
the
honour
and
prestige

are
your
instructions
as
the
minister
of
war
desires
me
to
convey
them
to
you
dios
i
do
not
know
how
all
this
is
to
be
accomplished
for
not
one
word
did
his
letter
contain
in
respect
to
a
crew
or
to
the
expenses
of
this
navy
perhaps
you
are
to
provide
a
crew
yourself
señor
admiral
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
a
very
high
honour
that
has
descended
upon
you

made
over
into
your
charge
that
is
as
far
as
my
instructions
go
felipe
took
the
commission
that
the
collector
handed
to
him
he
gazed
through
the
open
window
at
the
sea
for
a
moment
with
his
customary
expression
of
deep
but
vain
pondering
then
he
turned
without
having
spoken
a
word
and
walked
swiftly
away
through
the
hot
sand
of
the
street
loco
sighed
the
collector
and
the
parrot
on
the
pen
racks
screeched
loco
loco
loco
the
next
morning
a
strange
procession
filed
through
the
streets
to
the
collector
office
at
its
head
was
the
admiral
of
the
navy
somewhere
felipe
had
raked
together
a
pitiful
semblance
of
a
military
uniform
a
pair
of
red
trousers
a
dingy
blue
short
jacket
heavily
ornamented
with
gold
braid
and
an
old
fatigue
cap
that
must
have
been
cast
away
by
one
of
the
british
soldiers
in
belize
and
brought
away
by
felipe
on
one
of
his
coasting
voyages
buckled
around
his
waist
was
an
ancient
ship
cutlass
contributed
to
his
equipment
by
pedro
lafitte
the
baker
who
proudly
asserted
its
inheritance
from
his
ancestor
the
illustrious
buccaneer
at
the
admiral
heels
tagged
his
crew
three
grinning
glossy
black
caribs
bare
to
the
waist
the
sand
spurting
in
showers
from
the
spring
of
their
naked
feet
briefly
and
with
dignity
felipe
demanded
his
vessel
of
the
collector
and
now
a
fresh
honour
awaited
him
the
collector
wife
who
played
the
guitar
and
read
novels
in
the
hammock
all
day
had
more
than
a
little
romance
in
her
placid
yellow
bosom
she
had
found
in
an
old
book
an
engraving
of
a
flag
that
purported
to
be
the
naval
flag
of
anchuria
perhaps
it
had
so
been
designed
by
the
founders
of
the
nation
but
as
no
navy
had
ever
been
established
oblivion
had
claimed
the
flag
laboriously
with
her
own
hands
she
had
made
a
flag
after
the
pattern
a
red
cross
upon
a
ground
she
presented
it
to
felipe
with
these
words
brave
sailor
this
flag
is
of
your
country
be
true
and
defend
it
with
your
life
go
you
with
god
for
the
first
time
since
his
appointment
the
admiral
showed
a
flicker
of
emotion
he
took
the
silken
emblem
and
passed
his
hand
reverently
over
its
surface
i
am
the
admiral
he
said
to
the
lady
being
on
land
he
could
bring
himself
to
no
more
exuberant
expression
of
sentiment
at
sea
with
the
flag
at
the
masthead
of
his
navy
some
more
eloquent
exposition
of
feelings
might
be
forthcoming
abruptly
the
admiral
departed
with
his
crew
for
the
next
three
days
they
were
busy
giving
the
del
a
new
coat
of
white
paint
trimmed
with
blue
and
then
felipe
further
adorned
himself
by
fastening
a
handful
of
brilliant
parrot
plumes
in
his
cap
again
he
tramped
with
his
faithful
crew
to
the
collector
office
and
formally
notified
him
that
the
sloop
name
had
been
changed
to
during
the
next
few
months
the
navy
had
its
troubles
even
an
admiral
is
perplexed
to
know
what
to
do
without
any
orders
but
none
came
neither
did
any
salaries
swung
idly
at
anchor
when
felipe
little
store
of
money
was
exhausted
he
went
to
the
collector
and
raised
the
question
of
finances
salaries
exclaimed
the
collector
with
hands
raised
dios
not
one
of
my
own
pay
have
i
received
for
the
last
seven
months
the
pay
of
an
admiral
do
you
ask
sabe
should
it
be
less
than
three
thousand
you
will
see
a
revolution
in
this
country
very
soon
a
good
sign
of
it
is
when
the
government
calls
all
the
time
for
and
pays
none
out
felipe
left
the
collector
office
with
a
look
almost
of
content
on
his
sombre
face
a
revolution
would
mean
fighting
and
then
the
government
would
need
his
services
it
was
rather
humiliating
to
be
an
admiral
without
anything
to
do
and
have
a
hungry
crew
at
your
heels
begging
for
to
buy
plantains
and
tobacco
with
when
he
returned
to
where
his
caribs
were
waiting
they
sprang
up
and
saluted
as
he
had
drilled
them
to
do
come
said
the
admiral
it
seems
that
the
government
is
poor
it
has
no
money
to
give
us
we
will
earn
what
we
need
to
live
upon
thus
will
we
serve
our
country
soon
his
heavy
eyes
almost
lighted
up
it
may
gladly
call
upon
us
for
help
thereafter
turned
out
with
the
other
coast
craft
and
became

with
the
lighters
freighting
bananas
and
oranges
out
to
the
fruit
steamers
that
could
not
approach
nearer
than
a
mile
from
the
shore
surely
a
navy
deserves
red
letters
in
the
budget
of
any
nation
after
earning
enough
at
freighting
to
keep
himself
and
his
crew
in
provisions
for
a
week
felipe
would
anchor
the
navy
and
hang
about
the
little
telegraph
office
looking
like
one
of
the
chorus
of
an
insolvent
comic
opera
troupe
besieging
the
manager
den
a
hope
for
orders
from
the
capital
was
always
in
his
heart
that
his
services
as
admiral
had
never
been
called
into
requirement
hurt
his
pride
and
patriotism
at
every
call
he
would
inquire
gravely
and
expectantly
for
despatches
the
operator
would
pretend
to
make
a
search
and
then
reply
not
yet
it
seems

the
the
crew
chewed
sugar
cane
or
slumbered
well
content
to
serve
a
country
that
was
contented
with
so
little
service
one
day
in
the
early
summer
the
revolution
predicted
by
the
collector
flamed
out
suddenly
it
had
long
been
smouldering
at
the
first
note
of
alarm
the
admiral
of
the
navy
force
and
fleet
made
all
sail
for
a
larger
port
on
the
coast
of
a
neighbouring
republic
where
he
traded
a
hastily
collected
cargo
of
fruit
for
its
value
in
cartridges
for
the
five
martini
rifles
the
only
guns
that
the
navy
could
boast
then
to
the
telegraph
office
sped
the
admiral
sprawling
in
his
favourite
corner
in
his
uniform
with
his
prodigious
sabre
distributed
between
his
red
legs
he
waited
for
the
but
now
soon
expected
orders
not
yet
el
the
telegraph
clerk
would
call
to
him
tiempo
at
the
answer
the
admiral
would
plump
himself
down
with
a
great
rattling
of
scabbard
to
await
the
infrequent
tick
of
the
little
instrument
on
the
table
they
will
come
would
be
his
unshaken
reply

don

placido
a
traveller
a
soldier
a
poet
a
scientist
a
statesman
and
a
connoisseur
the
wonder
was
that
he
could
content
himself
with
the
petty
remote
life
of
his
native
country
it
is
a
whim
of
placido
said
a
friend
who
knew
him
well
to
take
up
political
intrigue
it
is
not
otherwise
than
as
if
he
had
come
upon
a
new
in
music
a
new
bacillus
in
the
air
a
new
scent
or
rhyme
or
explosive
he
will
squeeze
this
revolution
dry
of
sensations
and
a
week
afterward
will
forget
it
skimming
the
seas
of
the
world
in
his
brigantine
to
add
to
his
already
collections
collections
of
what
dios
of
everything
from
postage
stamps
to
prehistoric
stone
idols
but
for
a
mere
dilettante
the
æsthetic
placido
seemed
to
be
creating
a
lively
row
the
people
admired
him
they
were
fascinated
by
his
brilliancy
and
flattered
by
his
taking
an
interest
in
so
small
a
thing
as
his
native
country
they
rallied
to
the
call
of
his
lieutenants
in
the
capital
where
somewhat
contrary
to
arrangements
the
army
remained
faithful
to
the
government
there
was
also
lively
skirmishing
in
the
coast
towns
it
was
rumoured
that
the
revolution
was
aided
by
the
vesuvius

company
the
power
that
forever
stood
with
chiding
smile
and
uplifted
finger
to
keep
anchuria
in
the
class
of
good
children
two
of
its
steamers
the
and
the
were
known
to
have
conveyed
insurgent
troops
from
point
to
point
along
the
coast
as
yet
there
had
been
no
actual
uprising
in
coralio
military
law
prevailed
and
the
ferment
was
bottled
for
the
time
and
then
came
the
word
that
everywhere
the
revolutionists
were
encountering
defeat
in
the
capital
the
president
forces
triumphed
and
there
was
a
rumour
that
the
leaders
of
the
revolt
had
been
forced
to
fly
hotly
pursued
in
the
little
telegraph
office
at
coralio
there
was
always
a
gathering
of
officials
and
loyal
citizens
awaiting
news
from
the
seat
of
government
one
morning
the
telegraph
key
began
clicking
and
presently
the
operator
called
loudly
one
telegram
for
don
señor
felipe
carrera
there
was
a
shuffling
sound
a
great
rattling
of
tin
scabbard
and
the
admiral
prompt
at
his
spot
of
waiting
leaped
across
the
room
to
receive
it
the
message
was
handed
to
him
slowly
spelling
it
out
he
found
it
to
be
his
first
official
order
thus
running
proceed
immediately
with
your

general
small
glory
to
be
sure
in
this
his
country
first
call
but
it
had
called
and
joy
surged
in
the
admiral
breast
he
drew
his
cutlass
belt
to
another
buckle
hole
roused
his
dozing
crew
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
tacking
swiftly
down
coast
in
a
stiff
landward
breeze
the
rio
ruiz
is
a
small
river
emptying
into
the
sea
ten
miles
below
coralio
that
portion
of
the
coast
is
wild
and
solitary
through
a
gorge
in
the
cordilleras
rushes
the
rio
ruiz
cold
and
bubbling
to
glide
at
last
with
breadth
and
leisure
through
an
alluvial
morass
into
the
sea
in
two
hours
entered
the
river
mouth
the
banks
were
crowded
with
a
disposition
of
formidable
trees
the
sumptuous
undergrowth
of
the
tropics
overflowed
the
land
and
drowned
itself
in
the
fallow
waters
silently
the
sloop
entered
there
and
met
a
deeper
silence
brilliant
with
greens
and
ochres
and
floral
scarlets
the
umbrageous
mouth
of
the
rio
ruiz
furnished
no
sound
or
movement
save
of
the
water
as
it
purled
against
the
prow
of
the
vessel
small
chance
there
seemed
of
wresting
beef
or
provisions
from
that
empty
solitude
the
admiral
decided
to
cast
anchor
and
at
the
chain
rattle
the
forest
was
stimulated
to
instant
and
resounding
uproar
the
mouth
of
the
rio
ruiz
had
only
been
taking
a
morning
nap
parrots
and
baboons
screeched
and
barked
in
the
trees
a
whirring
and
a
hissing
and
a
booming
marked
the
awakening
of
animal
life
a
dark
blue
bulk
was
visible
for
an
instant
as
a
startled
tapir
fought
his
way
through
the
vines
the
navy
under
orders
hung
in
the
mouth
of
the
little
river
for
hours
the
crew
served
the
dinner
of
shark
fin
soup
plantains
crab
gumbo
and
sour
wine
the
admiral
with
a
telescope
closely
scanned
the
impervious
foliage
fifty
yards
away
it
was
nearly
sunset
when
a
reverberating
came
from
the
forest
to
their
left
it
was
answered
and
three
men
mounted
upon
mules
crashed
through
the
tropic
tangle
to
within
a
dozen
yards
of
the
river
bank
there
they
dismounted
and
one
unbuckling
his
belt
struck
each
mule
a
violent
blow
with
his
sword
scabbard
so
that
they
with
a
fling
of
heels
dashed
back
again
into
the
forest
those
were
men
to
be
conveying
beef
and
provisions
one
was
a
large
and
exceedingly
active
man
of
striking
presence
he
was
of
the
purest
spanish
type
with
curling
dark
hair
blue
sparkling
eyes
and
the
pronounced
air
of
a
the
other
two
were
small
men
wearing
white
military
uniforms
high
riding
boots
and
swords
the
clothes
of
all
were
drenched
bespattered
and
rent
by
the
thicket
some
stress
of
circumstance
must
have
driven
them
à
through
flood
mire
and
jungle
señor
called
the
large
man

to

your
boat
the
dory
was
lowered
and
felipe
with
one
of
the
caribs
rowed
toward
the
left
bank
the
large
man
stood
near
the
water
brink
waist
deep
in
the
curling
vines
as
he
gazed
upon
the
scarecrow
figure
in
the
stern
of
the
dory
a
sprightly
interest
beamed
upon
his
mobile
face
months
of
wageless
and
thankless
service
had
dimmed
the
splendour
his
red
trousers
were
patched
and
ragged
most
of
the
bright
buttons
and
yellow
braid
were
gone
from
his
jacket
the
visor
of
his
cap
was
torn
and
depended
almost
to
his
eyes
the
feet
were
bare
dear
admiral
cried
the
large
man
and
his
voice
was
like
a
blast
from
a
horn
i
kiss
your
hands
i
knew
we
could
build
upon
your
fidelity
you
had
our
despatch
from
general
martinez
a
little
nearer
with
your
boat
dear
admiral
upon
these
devils
of
shifting
vines
we
stand
with
the
smallest
security
felipe
regarded
him
with
a
stolid
face
provisions
and
beef
for
the
barracks
at
alforan
he
quoted
no
fault
of
the
butchers
that
the
beef
awaits
you
not
but
you
are
come
in
time
to
save
the
cattle
get
us
aboard
your
vessel
señor
at
once
you
first
á
priesa
come
back
for
me
the
boat
is
too
small
the
dory
conveyed
the
two
officers
to
the
sloop
and
returned
for
the
large
man
have
you
so
gross
a
thing
as
food
good
admiral
he
cried
when
aboard
and
perhaps
coffee
beef
and
provisions
de
dios
a
little
longer
and
we
could
have
eaten
one
of
those
mules
that
you
colonel
rafael
saluted
so
feelingly
with
your
sword
scabbard
at
parting
let
us
have
food
and
then
we
will
sail
for
the
barracks
at
alforan
no
the
caribs
prepared
a
meal
to
which
the
three
passengers
of
set
themselves
with
famished
delight
about
sunset
as
was
its
custom
the
breeze
veered
and
swept
back
from
the
mountains
cool
and
steady
bringing
a
taste
of
the
stagnant
lagoons
and
mangrove
swamps
that
guttered
the
lowlands
the
mainsail
of
the
sloop
was
hoisted
and
swelled
to
it
and
at
that
moment
they
heard
shouts
and
a
waxing
clamour
from
the
bosky
profundities
of
the
shore
the
butchers
my
dear
admiral
said
the
large
man
smiling
too
late
for
the
slaughter
further
than
his
orders
to
his
crew
the
admiral
was
saying
nothing
the
topsail
and
jib
were
spread
and
the
sloop
glided
out
of
the
estuary
the
large
man
and
his
companions
had
bestowed
themselves
with
what
comfort
they
could
about
the
bare
deck
belike
the
thing
big
in
their
minds
had
been
their
departure
from
that
critical
shore
and
now
that
the
hazard
was
so
far
reduced
their
thoughts
were
loosed
to
the
consideration
of
further
deliverance
but
when
they
saw
the
sloop
turn
and
fly
up
coast
again
they
relaxed
satisfied
with
the
course
the
admiral
had
taken
the
large
man
sat
at
ease
his
spirited
blue
eye
engaged
in
the
contemplation
of
the
navy
commander
he
was
trying
to
estimate
this
sombre
and
fantastic
lad
whose
impenetrable
stolidity
puzzled
him
himself
a
fugitive
his
life
sought
and
chafing
under
the
smart
of
defeat
and
failure
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
transfer
instantly
his
interest
to
the
study
of
a
thing
new
to
him
it
was
like
him
too
to
have
conceived
and
risked
all
upon
this
last
desperate
and
madcap
scheme
this
message
to
a
poor
crazed
cruising
about
with
his
grotesque
uniform
and
his
farcical
title
but
his
companions
had
been
at
their
wits
end
escape
had
seemed
incredible
and
now
he
was
pleased
with
the
success
of
the
plan
they
had
called
and
precarious
the
brief
tropic
twilight
seemed
to
slide
swiftly
into
the
pearly
splendour
of
a
moonlit
night
and
now
the
lights
of
coralio
appeared
distributed
against
the
darkening
shore
to
their
right
the
admiral
stood
silent
at
the
tiller
the
caribs
like
black
panthers
held
the
sheets
leaping
noiselessly
at
his
short
commands
the
three
passengers
were
watching
intently
the
sea
before
them
and
when
at
length
they
came
in
sight
of
the
bulk
of
a
steamer
lying
a
mile
out
from
the
town
with
her
lights
radiating
deep
into
the
water
they
held
a
sudden
voluble
and
converse
the
sloop
was
speeding
as
if
to
strike
midway
between
ship
and
shore
the
large
man
suddenly
separated
from
his
companions
and
approached
the
scarecrow
at
the
helm
my
dear
admiral
he
said
the
government
has
been
exceedingly
remiss
i
feel
all
the
shame
for
it
that
only
its
ignorance
of
your
devoted
service
has
prevented
it
from
sustaining
an
inexcusable
oversight
has
been
made
a
vessel
a
uniform
and
a
crew
worthy
of
your
fidelity
shall
be
furnished
you
but
just
now
dear
admiral
there
is
business
of
moment
afoot
the
steamer
lying
there
is
the
i
and
my
friends
desire
to
be
conveyed
to
her
where
we
are
sent
on
the
government
business
do
us
the
favour
to
shape
your
course
accordingly
without
replying
the
admiral
gave
a
sharp
command
and
put
the
tiller
hard
to
port
swerved
and
headed
straight
as
an
arrow
course
for
the
shore
do
me
the
favour
said
the
large
man
a
trifle
restively
to
acknowledge
at
least
that
you
catch
the
sound
of
my
words
it
was
possible
that
the
fellow
might
be
lacking
in
senses
as
well
as
intellect
the
admiral
emitted
a
croaking
harsh
laugh
and
spake
they
will
stand
you
he
said
with
your
face
to
a
wall
and
shoot
you
dead
that
is
the
way
they
kill
traitors
i
knew
you
when
you
stepped
into
my
boat
i
have
seen
your
picture
in
a
book
you
are
sabas
placido
traitor
to
your
country
with
your
face
to
a
wall
so
you
will
die
i
am
the
admiral
and
i
will
take
you
to
them
with
your
face
to
a
wall
yes
don
sabas
half
turned
and
waved
his
hand
with
a
ringing
laugh
toward
his
fellow
fugitives
to
you
i
have
related
the
history
of
that
session
when
we
issued
that
o
so
ridiculous
commission
of
a
truth
our
jest
has
been
turned
against
us
behold
the
frankenstein
monster
we
have
created
don
sabas
glanced
toward
the
shore
the
lights
of
coralio
were
drawing
near
he
could
see
the
beach
the
warehouse
of
the
the
long
low
occupied
by
the
soldiers
and
behind
that
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
a
stretch
of
high
adobe
wall
he
had
seen
men
stood
with
their
faces
to
that
wall
and
shot
dead
again
he
addressed
the
extravagant
figure
at
the
helm
it
is
true
he
said
that
i
am
fleeing
the
country
but
receive
the
assurance
that
i
care
very
little
for
that
courts
and
camps
everywhere
are
open
to
sabas
placido
what
is
this
molehill
of
a
republic
this
pig
head
of
a
country
to
a
man
like
me
i
am
a
of
everywhere
in
rome
in
london
in
paris
in
vienna
you
will
hear
them
say
back
don
sabas
come
baboon
of
a
boy
admiral
whatever
you
call
yourself
turn
your
boat
put
us
on
board
the
and
here
is
your
pay
five
hundred
in
money
of
the
more
than
your
lying
government
will
pay
you
in
twenty
years
don
sabas
pressed
a
plump
purse
against
the
youth
hand
the
admiral
gave
no
heed
to
the
words
or
the
movement
braced
against
the
helm
he
was
holding
the
sloop
dead
on
her
shoreward
course
his
dull
face
was
lit
almost
to
intelligence
by
some
inward
conceit
that
seemed
to
afford
him
joy
and
found
utterance
in
another
cackle
that
is
why
they
do
it
he
said
so
that
you
will
not
see
the
guns
they
fire
oom
and
you
fall
dead
with
your
face
to
the
wall
yes
the
admiral
called
a
sudden
order
to
his
crew
the
lithe
silent
caribs
made
fast
the
sheets
they
held
and
slipped
down
the
hatchway
into
the
hold
of
the
sloop
when
the
last
one
had
disappeared
don
sabas
like
a
big
brown
leopard
leaped
forward
closed
and
fastened
the
hatch
and
stood
smiling
no
rifles
if
you
please
dear
admiral
he
said
it
was
a
whimsey
of
mine
once
to
compile
a
dictionary
of
the
carib
so
i
understood
your
order
perhaps
now
you
will
he
cut
short
his
words
for
he
heard
the
dull
swish
of
iron
scraping
along
tin
the
admiral
had
drawn
the
cutlass
of
pedro
lafitte
and
was
darting
upon
him
the
blade
descended
and
it
was
only
by
a
display
of
surprising
agility
that
the
large
man
escaped
with
only
a
bruised
shoulder
the
glancing
weapon
he
was
drawing
his
pistol
as
he
sprang
and
the
next
instant
he
shot
the
admiral
down
don
sabas
stooped
over
him
and
rose
again
in
the
heart
he
said
briefly
the
navy
is
abolished
colonel
rafael
sprang
to
the
helm
and
the
other
officer
hastened
to
loose
the
mainsail
sheets
the
boom
swung
round
veered
and
began
to
tack
industriously
for
the
strike
that
flag
señor
called
colonel
rafael
our
friends
on
the
steamer
will
wonder
why
we
are
sailing
under
it
well
said
cried
don
sabas
advancing
to
the
mast
he
lowered
the
flag
to
the
deck
where
lay
its
too
loyal
supporter
thus
ended
the
minister
of
war
little
piece
of
drollery
and
by
the
same
hand
that
began
it
suddenly
don
sabas
gave
a
great
cry
of
joy
and
ran
down
the
slanting
deck
to
the
side
of
colonel
rafael
across
his
arm
he
carried
the
flag
of
the
extinguished
navy
mire
ah
already
can
i
hear
that
great
bear
of
an
shout
hast
mein
herz
gebrochen
mire
of
my
friend
herr
grunitz
of
vienna
you
have
heard
me
relate
that
man
has
travelled
to
ceylon
for
an
orchid
to
patagonia
for
a
headdress
to
benares
for
a
slipper
to
mozambique
for
a
spearhead
to
add
to
his
famous
collections
thou
knowest
also
rafael
that
i
have
been
a
gatherer
of
curios
my
collection
of
battle
flags
of
the
world
navies
was
the
most
complete
in
existence
until
last
year
then
herr
grunitz
secured
two
o
such
rare
specimens
one
of
a
barbary
state
and
one
of
the
makarooroos
a
tribe
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
i
have
not
those
but
they
can
be
procured
but
this
flag
señor
do
you
know
what
it
is
name
of
god
do
you
know
see
that
red
cross
upon
the
blue
and
white
ground
you
never
saw
it
before
it
is
the
naval
flag
of
your
country
this
rotten
tub
we
stand
upon
is
its
navy
that
dead
cockatoo
lying
there
was
its
commander
that
stroke
of
cutlass
and
single
pistol
shot
a
sea
battle
all
a
piece
of
absurd
foolery
i
grant
you
but
authentic
there
has
never
been
another
flag
like
this
and
there
never
will
be
another
no
it
is
unique
in
the
whole
world
yes
think
of
what
that
means
to
a
collector
of
flags
do
you
know
how
many
golden
crowns
herr
grunitz
would
give
for
this
flag
ten
thousand
likely
well
a
hundred
thousand
would
not
buy
it
beautiful
flag
only
flag
little
devil
of
a
most
flag
old
grumbler
beyond
the
ocean
wait
till
don
sabas
comes
again
to
the
königin
strasse
he
will
let
you
kneel
and
touch
the
folds
of
it
with
one
finger
old
spectacled
ransacker
of
the
world
forgotten
was
the
impotent
revolution
the
danger
the
loss
the
gall
of
defeat
possessed
solely
by
the
inordinate
and
unparalleled
passion
of
the
collector
he
strode
up
and
down
the
little
deck
clasping
to
his
breast
with
one
hand
the
paragon
of
a
flag
he
snapped
his
fingers
triumphantly
toward
the
east
he
shouted
the
paean
to
his
prize
in
trumpet
tones
as
though
he
would
make
old
grunitz
hear
in
his
musty
den
beyond
the
sea
they
were
waiting
on
the
to
welcome
them
the
sloop
came
close
alongside
the
steamer
where
her
sides
were
sliced
almost
to
the
lower
deck
for
the
loading
of
fruit
the
sailors
of
the
grappled
and
held
her
there
captain
mcleod
leaned
over
the
side
well
señor
the
jig
is
up
i
told
the
jig
is
up
don
sabas
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment
that
revolution
ah
yes
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
dismissed
the
matter
the
captain
learned
of
the
escape
and
the
imprisoned
crew
caribs
he
said
no
harm
in
them
he
slipped
down
into
the
sloop
and
kicked
loose
the
hasp
of
the
hatch
the
black
fellows
came
tumbling
up
sweating
but
grinning
hey
black
boys
said
the
captain
in
a
dialect
of
his
own
you
sabe
catchy
boat
and
vamos
back
same
place
quick
they
saw
him
point
to
themselves
the
sloop
and
coralio
yas
yas
they
cried
with
broader
grins
and
many
nods
the
four
don
sabas
the
two
officers
and
the
captain
moved
to
quit
the
sloop
don
sabas
lagged
a
little
behind
looking
at
the
still
form
of
the
late
admiral
sprawled
in
his
paltry
trappings
he
said
softly
he
was
a
brilliant
cosmopolite
and
a
of
high
rank
but
after
all
he
was
of
the
same
race
and
blood
and
instinct
as
this
people
even
as
the
simple
of
coralio
had
said
it
so
said
don
sabas
without
a
smile
he
looked
and
said
the
poor
little
crazed
one
stooping
he
raised
the
limp
shoulders
drew
the
priceless
and
induplicable
flag
under
them
and
over
the
breast
pinning
it
there
with
the
diamond
star
of
the
order
of
san
carlos
that
he
took
from
the
collar
of
his
own
coat
he
followed
after
the
others
and
stood
with
them
upon
the
deck
of
the
the
sailors
that
steadied
shoved
her
off
the
jabbering
caribs
hauled
away
at
the
rigging
the
sloop
headed
for
the
shore
and
herr
grunitz
collection
of
naval
flags
was
still
the
finest
in
the
world
x
the
shamrock
and
the
palm
one
night
when
there
was
no
breeze
and
coralio
seemed
closer
than
ever
to
the
gratings
of
avernus
five
men
were
grouped
about
the
door
of

many

not

the

had
wooed
him
upon

sometimes

secure
your
aid
airily
inquired
blanchard
where
kamchatka
asked
clancy
with
seeming
irrelevance
why
off
siberia
somewhere
in
the
arctic
regions
somebody
answered
doubtfully
i
thought
that
was
the
cold
one
said
clancy
with
a
satisfied
nod
i
always
gettin
the
two
names
mixed
was
guatemala
then
the
hot
one
i
been
filibusterin
with
ye
find
that
country
on
the
map
is
in
the
district
known
as
the
tropics
by
the
foresight
of
providence
it
lies
on
the
coast
so
the
geography
man
could
run
the
names
of
the
towns
off
into
the
water
they
an
inch
long
small
type
composed
of
spanish
dialects
and
is
my
opinion
of
the
same
system
of
syntax
that
blew
up
the
yes
was
that
country
i
sailed
against
and
endeavoured
to
liberate
it
from
a
tyrannical
government
with
a
pickaxe
unloaded
at
that
ye
do
understand
of
course
is
a
statement
elucidation
and
apologies
was
in
new
orleans
one
morning
about
the
first
of
june
i
was
standin
down
on
the
wharf
lookin
about
at
the
ships
in
the
river
there
was
a
little
steamer
moored
right
opposite
me
that
seemed
about
ready
to
sail
the
funnels
of
it
were
throwin
out
smoke
and
a
gang
of
roustabouts
were
carryin
aboard
a
pile
of
boxes
that
was
stacked
up
on
the
wharf
the
boxes
were
about
two
feet
square
and
like
four
feet
long
and
they
seemed
to
be
pretty
heavy
i
walked
over
careless
to
the
stack
of
boxes
i
saw
one
of
them
had
been
broken
in
handlin
was
curiosity
made
me
pull
up
the
loose
top
and
look
inside
the
box
was
packed
full
of
winchester
rifles
so
says
i
to
myself
gettin
a
twist
on
the
neutrality
laws
somebody
aidin
with
munitions
of
war
i
wonder
where
the
popguns
are
goin
i
heard
somebody
cough
and
i
turned
around
there
stood
a
little
round
fat
man
with
a
brown
face
and
white
clothes
a
little
man
with
a
diamond
on
his
finger
and
his
eye
full
of
interrogations
and
respects
i
judged
he
was
a
kind
of
foreigner
may
be
from
russia
or
japan
or
the
archipelagoes
says
the
round
man
full
of
concealments
and
confidences
the
señor
respect
the
discoveryments
he
has
made
that
the
mans
on
the
ship
shall
not
be
acquaint
the
señor
will
be
a
gentleman
that
shall
not
expose
one
thing
that
by
accident
occur
says
i
for
i
judged
him
to
be
a
kind
of
frenchman
my
most
exasperated
assurances
that
your
secret
is
safe
with
james
clancy
furthermore
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
remark
veev
la
liberty
veev
it
good
and
strong
whenever
you
hear
of
a
clancy
obstructin
the
abolishment
of
existin
governments
you
may
notify
me
by
return
mail
señor
is
good
says
the
dark
fat
man
smilin
under
his
black
mustache
you
to
come
aboard
my
ship
and
drink
of
wine
a
glass
bein
a
clancy
in
two
minutes
me
and
the
foreigner
man
were
seated
at
a
table
in
the
cabin
of
the
steamer
with
a
bottle
between
us
i
could
hear
the
heavy
boxes
bein
dumped
into
the
hold
i
judged
that
cargo
must
consist
of
at
least
winchesters
me
and
the
brown
man
drank
the
bottle
of
stuff
and
he
called
the
steward
to
bring
another
when
you
amalgamate
a
clancy
with
the
contents
of
a
bottle
you
practically
instigate
secession
i
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
these
revolutions
in
them
tropical
localities
and
i
begun
to
want
a
hand
in
it
goin
to
stir
things
up
in
your
country
ai
you
monseer
says
i
with
a
wink
to
let
him
know
i
was
on
yes
said
the
little
man
pounding
his
fist
on
the
table
change
of
the
greatest
will
occur
too
long
have
the
people
been
oppressed
with
the
promises
and
the
things
to
become
the
great
work
it
shall
be
carry
on
yes
our
forces
shall
in
the
capital
city
strike
of
the
soonest
is
the
word
says
i
beginning
to
invest
myself
with
enthusiasm
and
more
wine
veeva
as
i
said
before
may
the
shamrock
of
old
i
mean
the
or
the
or
whatever
the
imperial
emblem
may
be
of
your
country
wave
forever
thousand
says
the
round
man
your
emission
of
amicable
utterances
what
our
cause
needs
of
the
very
most
is
mans
who
will
the
work
do
to
lift
it
along
oh
for
one
thousands
strong
good
mans
to
aid
the
general
de
vega
that
he
shall
to
his
country
bring
those
success
and
glory
it
is
hard
oh
so
hard
to
find
good
mans
to
help
in
the
work
says
i
leanin
over
the
table
and
graspin
his
hand
do
know
where
your
country
is
but
me
heart
bleeds
for
it
the
heart
of
a
clancy
was
never
deaf
to
the
sight
of
an
oppressed
people
the
family
is
filibusterers
by
birth
and
foreigners
by
trade
if
you
can
use
james
clancy
arms
and
his
blood
in
denudin
your
shores
of
the
tyrant
yoke
they
yours
to
command
general
de
vega
was
overcome
with
joy
to
confiscate
my
condolence
of
his
conspiracies
and
predicaments
he
tried
to
embrace
me
across
the
table
but
his
fatness
and
the
wine
that
had
been
in
the
bottles
prevented
thus
was
i
welcomed
into
the
ranks
of
filibustery
then
the
general
man
told
me
his
country
had
the
name
of
guatemala
and
was
the
greatest
nation
laved
by
any
ocean
whatever
anywhere
he
looked
at
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
from
time
to
time
he
would
emit
the
remark
big
strong
brave
mans
that
is
what
my
country
need
general
de
vega
as
was
the
name
by
which
he
denounced
himself
brought
out
a
document
for
me
to
sign
which
i
did
makin
a
fine
flourish
and
curlycue
with
the
tail
of
the
says
the
general
from
your
pay
be
deduct
not
says
i
haughty
pay
my
own
passage
a
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
i
had
in
my
inside
pocket
and
was
no
common
filibuster
i
was
goin
to
be
filibusterin
for
me
board
and
clothes
the
steamer
was
to
sail
in
two
hours
and
i
went
ashore
to
get
some
things
together
i
need
when
i
came
aboard
i
showed
the
general
with
pride
the
outfit
was
a
fine
chinchilla
overcoat
arctic
overshoes
fur
cap
and
earmuffs
with
elegant
gloves
and
woolen
muffler
says
the
little
general
clothes
are
these
that
shall
go
to
the
tropic
and
then
the
little
spalpeen
laughs
and
he
calls
the
captain
and
the
captain
calls
the
purser
and
they
pipe
up
the
chief
engineer
and
the
whole
gang
leans
against
the
cabin
and
laughs
at
clancy
wardrobe
for
guatemala
i
reflects
a
bit
serious
and
asks
the
general
again
to
denominate
the
terms
by
which
his
country
is
called
he
tells
me
and
i
see
then
that
was
the
one
kamchatka
i
had
in
mind
since
then
had
difficulty
in
separatin
the
two
nations
in
name
climate
and
geographic
disposition
i
paid
my
passage
dollars
first
cabin
and
ate
at
table
with
the
officer
crowd
down
on
the
lower
deck
was
a
gang
of
passengers
about
forty
of
them
seemin
to
be
dagoes
and
the
like
i
wondered
what
so
many
of
them
were
goin
along
for
well
then
in
three
days
we
sailed
alongside
that
guatemala
was
a
blue
country
and
not
yellow
as
is
miscolored
on
the
map
we
landed
at
a
town
on
the
coast
where
a
train
of
cars
was
waitin
for
us
on
a
dinky
little
railroad
the
boxes
on
the
steamer
were
brought
ashore
and
loaded
on
the
cars
the
gang
of
dagoes
got
aboard
too
the
general
and
me
in
the
front
car
yes
me
and
general
de
vega
headed
the
revolution
as
it
pulled
out
of
the
seaport
town
that
train
travelled
about
as
fast
as
a
policeman
goin
to
a
riot
it
penetrated
the
most
conspicuous
lot
of
fuzzy
scenery
ever
seen
outside
a
geography
we
run
some
forty
miles
in
seven
hours
and
the
train
stopped
there
was
no
more
railroad
was
a
sort
of
camp
in
a
damp
gorge
full
of
wildness
and
melancholies
they
was
gradin
and
choppin
out
the
forests
ahead
to
continue
the
road
says
i
to
myself
the
romantic
haunt
of
the
revolutionists
here
will
clancy
by
the
virtue
that
is
in
a
superior
race
and
the
inculcation
of
fenian
tactics
strike
a
tremendous
blow
for
liberty
they
unloaded
the
boxes
from
the
train
and
begun
to
knock
the
tops
off
from
the
first
one
that
was
open
i
saw
general
de
vega
take
the
winchester
rifles
and
pass
them
around
to
a
squad
of
morbid
soldiery
the
other
boxes
was
opened
next
and
believe
me
or
not
divil
another
gun
was
to
be
seen
every
other
box
in
the
load
was
full
of
pickaxes
and
spades
and
then
sorrow
be
upon
them
tropics
the
proud
clancy
and
the
dishonoured
dagoes
each
one
of
them
had
to
shoulder
a
pick
or
a
spade
and
march
away
to
work
on
that
dirty
little
railroad
yes
that
the
dagoes
shipped
for
and
was
that
the
clancy
signed
for
though
unbeknownst
to
himself
at
the
time
in
after
days
i
found
out
about
it
it
seems
was
hard
to
get
hands
to
work
on
that
road
the
intelligent
natives
of
the
country
was
too
lazy
to
work
indeed
the
saints
know
was
unnecessary
by
stretchin
out
one
hand
they
could
seize
the
most
delicate
and
costly
fruits
of
the
earth
and
by
stretchin
out
the
other
they
could
sleep
for
days
at
a
time
without
hearin
a
whistle
or
the
footsteps
of
the
rent
man
upon
the
stairs
so
regular
the
steamers
travelled
to
the
united
states
to
seduce
labour
usually
the
imported
died
in
two
or
three
months
from
eatin
the
water
and
breathin
the
violent
tropical
scenery
wherefore
they
made
them
sign
contracts
for
a
year
when
they
hired
them
and
put
an
armed
guard
over
the
poor
divils
to
keep
them
from
runnin
away
was
thus
i
was
by
the
tropics
through
a
family
failin
of
goin
out
of
the
way
to
hunt
disturbances
they
gave
me
a
pick
and
i
took
it
meditatin
an
insurrection
on
the
spot
but
there
was
the
guards
handlin
the
winchesters
careless
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
discretion
was
the
best
part
of
filibusterin
there
was
about
a
hundred
of
us
in
the
gang
out
to
work
and
the
word
was
given
to
move
i
steps
out
of
the
ranks
and
goes
up
to
that
general
de
vega
man
who
was
smokin
a
cigar
and
gazin
upon
the
scene
with
satisfactions
and
glory
he
smiles
at
me
polite
and
devilish
work
says
he
big
strong
mans
in
guatemala
yes
dollars
in
the
month
good
pay
ah
yes
you
strong
brave
man
bimeby
we
push
those
railroad
in
the
capital
very
quick
they
want
you
go
work
now
strong
mans
says
i
lingerin
you
tell
a
poor
little
irishman
this
when
i
set
foot
on
your
cockroachy
steamer
and
breathed
liberal
and
revolutionary
sentiments
into
your
sour
wine
did
you
think
i
was
conspirin
to
sling
a
pick
on
your
contemptuous
little
railroad
and
when
you
answered
me
with
patriotic
recitations
humping
up
the
cause
of
liberty
did
you
have
meditations
of
reducin
me
to
the
ranks
of
the
dagoes
in
the
of
your
vile
and
grovelin
country
the
general
man
expanded
his
rotundity
and
laughed
considerable
yes
he
laughed
very
long
and
loud
and
i
clancy
stood
and
waited
mans
he
shouts
at
last
you
will
kill
me
from
the
laughing
yes
it
is
hard
to
find
the
brave
strong
mans
to
aid
my
country
revolutions
did
i
speak
of
not
one
word
i
say
big
strong
mans
is
need
in
guatemala
so
the
mistake
is
of
you
you
have
looked
in
those
one
box
containing
those
gun
for
the
guard
you
think
all
boxes
is
contain
gun
no
is
not
war
in
guatemala
but
work
yes
good
dollar
in
the
month
you
shall
shoulder
one
pickaxe
señor
and
dig
for
the
liberty
and
prosperity
of
guatemala
off
to
your
work
the
guard
waits
for
you
fat
poodle
dog
of
a
brown
man
says
i
quiet
but
full
of
indignations
and
discomforts
shall
happen
to
you
maybe
not
right
away
but
as
soon
as
clancy
can
formulate
somethin
in
the
way
of
repartee
the
boss
of
the
gang
orders
us
to
work
i
tramps
off
with
the
dagoes
and
i
hears
the
distinguished
patriot
and
kidnapper
hearty
as
we
go
is
a
sorrowful
fact
for
eight
weeks
i
built
railroads
for
that
misbehavin
country
i
filibustered
twelve
hours
a
day
with
a
heavy
pick
and
a
spade
choppin
away
the
luxurious
landscape
that
grew
upon
the
right
of
way
we
worked
in
swamps
that
smelled
like
there
was
a
leak
in
the
gas
mains
trampin
down
a
fine
assortment
of
the
most
expensive
hothouse
plants
and
vegetables
the
scene
was
tropical
beyond
the
wildest
imagination
of
the
geography
man
the
trees
was
all
the
underbrush
was
full
of
needles
and
pins
there
was
monkeys
jumpin
around
and
crocodiles
and
and
ye
stood
in
the
rotten
water
and
grabbled
roots
for
the
liberation
of
guatemala
of
nights
we
would
build
smudges
in
camp
to
discourage
the
mosquitoes
and
sit
in
the
smoke
with
the
guards
pacin
all
around
us
there
was
two
hundred
men
workin
on
the
road
mostly
dagoes
and
swedes
three
or
four
were
irish
one
old
man
named
halloran
a
man
of
hibernian
entitlements
and
discretions
explained
it
to
me
he
had
been
workin
on
the
road
a
year
most
of
them
died
in
less
than
six
months
he
was
dried
up
to
gristle
and
bone
and
shook
with
chills
every
third
night
you
first
come
says
he
think
ye
leave
right
away
but
they
hold
out
your
first
month
pay
for
your
passage
over
and
by
that
time
the
tropics
has
its
grip
on
ye
ye
surrounded
by
a
ragin
forest
full
of
disreputable
beasts
lions
and
baboons
and
anacondas
waitin
to
devour
ye
the
sun
strikes
ye
hard
and
melts
the
marrow
in
your
bones
ye
get
similar
to
the
the
speaks
about
ye
forget
the
elevated
sintiments
of
life
such
as
patriotism
revenge
disturbances
of
the
peace
and
the
dacint
love
of
a
clane
shirt
ye
do
your
work
and
ye
swallow
the
kerosene
ile
and
rubber
pipestems
dished
up
to
ye
by
the
dago
cook
for
food
ye
light
your
pipeful
and
say

revolutionary
army
of
this
dark
country
in
good
faith

for
its
liberty

and
silver
candlesticks
instead
of

amputatin
its
scenery
and
grubbin
its
roots
is
the
general
man
will
have
to
pay
for
it
two
months
i
worked
on
that
railroad
before
i
found
a
chance
to
get
away
one
day
a
gang
of
us
was
sent
back
to
the
end
of
the
completed
line
to
fetch
some
picks
that
had
been
sent
down
to
port
barrios
to
be
sharpened
they
were
brought
on
a
and
i
noticed
when
i
started
away
that
the
car
was
left
there
on
the
track
that
night
about
twelve
i
woke
up
halloran
and
told
him
my
scheme

says
halloran
lord
clancy

ye
mean
it
why
i
ai
got
the
nerve
it
too
chilly
and
i
ai
slept
enough
run
away
i
told
you
clancy
i
eat
the
lettuce
i
lost
my
grip
is
the
tropics
that
done
it
is
like
the
poet
says
forgotten

our
friends
that
we
have
left
behind
in
the
hollow
we
will
live
and
lay
reclined
you
better
go
on
clancy
i
stay
i
guess
it
too
early
and
cold
and
i
sleepy
so
i
had
to
leave
halloran
i
dressed
quiet
and
slipped
out
of
the
tent
we
were
in
when
the
guard
came
along
i
knocked
him
over
like
a
ninepin
with
a
green
cocoanut
i
had
and
made
for
the
railroad
i
got
on
that
and
made
it
fly
was
yet
a
while
before
daybreak
when
i
saw
the
lights
of
port
barrios
about
a
mile
away
i
stopped
the
there
and
walked
to
the
town
i
stepped
inside
the
corporations
of
that
town
with
care
and
hesitations
i
was
not
afraid
of
the
army
of
guatemala
but
me
soul
quaked
at
the
prospect
of
a
struggle

the
tropics
with
a
pick
and
shovel
but
is
not
so
much
a
question
of
insurrections
now
me
little
man
as
is
of
the
problem
is
anxious
i
am
to
resign
a
situation
of
responsibility
and
trust
with
the
white
wings
department
of
your
great
and
degraded
country
row
me
in
your
little
boat
out
to
that
steamer
and
i
give
ye
five
dollars
sinker
pacers
sinker
pacers
says
i
reducin
the
offer
to
the
language
and
denomination
of
the
tropic
dialects
repeats
the
little
man
dollee
you
give
was
not
such
a
bad
little
man
he
had
hesitations
at
first
that
passengers
leavin
the
country
had
to
have
papers
and
passports
but
at
last
he
took
me
out
alongside
the
steamer
day
was
just
breakin
as
we
struck
her
and
there
was
a
soul
to
be
seen
on
board
the
water
was
very
still
and
the
gave
me
a
lift
from
the
boat
and
i
climbed
onto
the
steamer
where
her
side
was
sliced
to
the
deck
for
loadin
fruit
the
hatches
was
open
and
i
looked
down
and
saw
the
cargo
of
bananas
that
filled
the
hold
to
within
six
feet
of
the
top
i
thinks
to
myself
you
better
go
as
a
stowaway
it
safer
the
steamer
men
might
hand
you
back
to
the
employment
bureau
the
tropic
get
you
clancy
if
you
do
watch
out
so
i
jumps
down
easy
among
the
bananas
and
digs
out
a
hole
to
hide
in
among
the
bunches
in
an
hour
or
so
i
could
hear
the
engines
goin
and
feel
the
steamer
rockin
and
i
knew
we
were
off
to
sea
they
left
the
hatches
open
for
ventilation
and
pretty
soon
it
was
light
enough
in
the
hold
to
see
fairly
well
i
got
to
a
bit
hungry
and
thought
i
have
a
light
fruit
lunch
by
way
of
refreshment
i
creeped
out
of
the
hole
i
made
and
stood
up
straight
just
then
i
saw
another
man
crawl
up
about
ten
feet
away
and
reach
out
and
skin
a
banana
and
stuff
it
into
his
mouth
was
a
dirty
man
and
ragged
and
disgraceful
of
aspect
yes
the
man
was
a
ringer
for
the
pictures
of
the
fat
weary
willie
in
the
funny
papers
i
looked
again
and
saw
it
was
my
general
man
de
vega
the
great
revolutionist
and
pickaxe
importer
when
he
saw
me
the
general
hesitated
with
his
mouth
filled
with
banana
and
his
eyes
the
size
of
cocoanuts
i
says
a
word
or
they
put
us
off
and
make
us
walk
veev
la
liberty
i
adds
copperin
the
sentiment
by
shovin
a
banana
into
the
source
of
it
i
was
certain
the
general
recognize
me
the
nefarious
work
of
the
tropics
had
left
me
different
there
was
half
an
inch
of
roan
whiskers
coverin
me
face
and
me
costume
was
a
pair
of
blue
overalls
and
a
red
shirt
you
come
in
the
ship
señor
asked
the
general
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
the
back
door
whist
says
i
a
glorious
blow
for
liberty
we
struck
i
continues
we
was
overpowered
by
numbers
let
us
accept
our
defeat
like
brave
men
and
eat
another
banana
you
in
the
cause
of
liberty
fightin
señor
says
the
general
sheddin
tears
on
the
cargo
the
last
says
i
i
led
the
last
desperate
charge
against
the
minions
of
the
tyrant
but
it
made
them
mad
and
we
was
forced
to
retreat
was
i
general
procured
the
mule
upon
which
you
escaped
could
you
give
that
ripe
bunch
a
little
boost
this
way
general
it
a
bit
out
of
my
reach
thanks
you
so
brave
patriot
said
the
general
again
weepin
and
i
have
not
the
means
to
reward
your
devotion
barely
did
i
my
life
bring
away
what
a
devil
animal
was
that
mule
señor
like
ships
in
one
storm
was
i
dashed
about
the
skin
on
myself
was
ripped
away
with
the
thorns
and
vines
upon
the
bark
of
a
hundred
trees
did
that
beast
of
the
infernal
bump
and
cause
outrage
to
the
legs
of
mine
in
the
night
to
port
barrios
i
came
i
dispossess
myself
of
that
mountain
of
mule
and
hasten
along
the
water
shore
i
find
a
little
boat
to
be
tied
i
launch
myself
and
row
to
the
steamer
i
can
not
see
any
mans
on
board
so
i
climbed
one
rope
which
hang
at
the
side
i
then
myself
hide
in
the
bananas
surely
i
say
if
the
ship
captains
view
me
they
shall
throw
me
again
to
those
guatemala
those
things
are
not
good
guatemala
will
shoot
general
de
vega
therefore
i
am
hide
and
remain
silent
life
itself
is
glorious
liberty
it
is
pretty
good
but
so
good
as
life
i
do
not
think
three
days
as
i
said
was
the
trip
to
new
orleans
the
general
man
and
me
got
to
be
cronies
of
the
deepest
dye
bananas
we
ate
until
they
were
distasteful
to
the
sight
and
an
eyesore
to
the
palate
but
to
bananas
alone
was
the
bill
of
fare
reduced
at
night
i
crawls
out
careful
on
the
lower
deck
and
gets
a
bucket
of
fresh
water
that
general
de
vega
was
a
man
inhabited
by
an
engorgement
of
words
and
sentences
he
added
to
the
monotony
of
the
voyage
by
himself
of
conversation
he
believed
i
was
a
revolutionist
of
his
own
party
there
bein
as
he
told
me
a
good
many
americans
and
other
foreigners
in
its
ranks
was
a
braggart
and
a
conceited
little
gabbler
it
was
though
he
considered
himself
a
hero
was
on
himself
he
wasted
all
his
regrets
at
the
failin
of
his
plot
not
a
word
did
the
little
balloon
have
to
say
about
the
other
misbehavin
idiots
that
had
been
shot
or
run
themselves
to
death
in
his
revolution
the
second
day
out
he
was
feelin
pretty
braggy
and
uppish
for
a
conspirator
that
owed
his
existence
to
a
mule
and
stolen
bananas
he
was
tellin
me
about
the
great
railroad
he
had
been
buildin
and
he
relates
what
he
calls
a
comic
incident
about
a
fool
irishman
he
inveigled
from
new
orleans
to
sling
a
pick
on
his
little
morgue
of
a
line
was
sorrowful
to
hear
the
little
dirty
general
tell
the
opprobrious
story
of
how
he
put
salt
upon
the
tail
of
that
reckless
and
silly
bird
clancy
laugh
he
did
hearty
and
long
he
shook
with
laughin
the
rebel
and
outcast
standin
in
bananas
without
friends
or
country
señor
he
snickers
the
death
you
would
have
laughed
at
that
drollest
irish
i
say
to
him
strong
big
mans
is
need
very
much
in
guatemala
i
will
blows
strike
for
your
country
he
say
that
shall
you
do
i
tell
him
ah
it
was
an
irish
so
comic
he
sees
one
box
break
upon
the
wharf
that
contain
for
the
guard
a
few
gun
he
think
there
is
gun
in
all
the
box
but
that
is
all
pickaxe
yes
ah
señor
could
you
the
face
of
that
irish
have
seen
when
they
set
him
to
the
work
was
thus
the
of
the
employment
bureau
contributed
to
the
tedium
of
the
trip
with
merry
jests
and
anecdote
but
now
and
then
he
would
weep
upon
the
bananas
and
make
oration
about
the
lost
cause
of
liberty
and
the
mule
was
a
pleasant
sound
when
the
steamer
bumped
against
the
pier
in
new
orleans
pretty
soon
we
heard
the
of
hundreds
of
bare
feet
and
the
dago
gang
that
unloads
the
fruit
jumped
on
the
deck
and
down
into
the
hold
me
and
the
general
worked
a
while
at
passin
up
the
bunches
and
they
thought
we
were
part
of
the
gang
after
about
an
hour
we
managed
to
slip
off
the
steamer
onto
the
wharf
was
a
great
honour
on
the
hands
of
an
obscure
clancy
havin
the
entertainment
of
the
representative
of
a
great
foreign
power
i
first
bought
for
the
general
and
myself
many
long
drinks
and
things
to
eat
that
were
not
bananas
the
general
man
trotted
along
at
my
side
leavin
all
the
arrangements
to
me
i
led
him
up
to
lafayette
square
and
set
him
on
a
bench
in
the
little
park
cigarettes
i
had
bought
for
him
and
he
humped
himself
down
on
the
seat
like
a
little
fat
contented
hobo
i
look
him
over
as
he
sets
there
and
what
i
see
pleases
me
brown
by
nature
and
instinct
he
is
now
brindled
with
dirt
and
dust
praise
to
the
mule
his
clothes
is
mostly
strings
and
flaps
yes
the
looks
of
the
general
man
is
agreeable
to
clancy
i
ask
him
delicate
if
by
any
chance
he
brought
away
money
with
him
from
guatemala
he
sighs
and
bumps
his
shoulders
against
the
bench
not
a
cent
all
right
maybe
he
tells
me
some
of
his
friends
in
the
tropic
outfit
will
send
him
funds
later
the
general
was
as
clear
a
case
of
no
visible
means
as
i
ever
saw
i
told
him
not
to
move
from
the
bench
and
then
i
went
up
to
the
corner
of
poydras
and
carondelet
along
there
is
beat
in
five
minutes
along
comes
a
big
fine
man
with
shinin
buttons
swingin
his
club
be
a
fine
thing
for

a
fine
bit
of
recreation

into
a
doorway

says

the
remnants
of
the
code
breakfast
in
coralio
was
at
eleven
therefore
the
people
did
not
go
to
market
early
the
little
wooden
stood
on
a
patch
of
grass
under
the
vivid
green
foliage
of
a
tree
thither
one
morning
the
venders
leisurely
convened
bringing
their
wares
with
them
a
porch
or
platform
six
feet
wide
encircled
the
building
shaded
from
the
sun
by
the
projecting
roof
upon
this
platform
the
venders
were
wont
to
display
their
goods
beef
fish
crabs
fruit
of
the
country
cassava
eggs
and
high
tottering
stacks
of
native
tortillas
as
large
around
as
the
sombrero
of
a
spanish
grandee
but
on
this
morning
they
whose
stations
lay
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
instead
of
spreading
their
merchandise
formed
themselves
into
a
softly
jabbering
and
gesticulating
group
for
there
upon
their
space
of
the
platform
was
sprawled
asleep
the
unbeautiful
figure
of
beelzebub
blythe
he
lay
upon
a
ragged
strip
of
cocoa
matting
more
than
ever
a
fallen
angel
in
appearance
his
suit
of
coarse
flax
soiled
bursting
at
the
seams
crumpled
into
a
thousand
diversified
wrinkles
and
creases
inclosed
him
absurdly
like
the
garb
of
some
effigy
that
had
been
stuffed
in
sport
and
thrown
there
after
indignity
had
been
wrought
upon
it
but
firmly
upon
the
high
bridge
of
his
nose
reposed
his
glasses
the
surviving
badge
of
his
ancient
glory
the
sun
rays
reflecting
quiveringly
from
the
rippling
sea
upon
his
face
and
the
voices
of
the
woke
beelzebub
blythe
he
sat
up
blinking
and
leaned
his
back
against
the
wall
of
the
market
drawing
a
blighted
silk
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
he
assiduously
rubbed
and
burnished
his
glasses
and
while
doing
this
he
became
aware
that
his
bedroom
had
been
invaded
and
that
polite
brown
and
yellow
men
were
beseeching
him
to
vacate
in
favour
of
their
market
stuff
if
the
señor
would
have
the
goodness
a
thousand
pardons
for
bringing
to
him
molestation
but
soon
would
come
the
for
the
day
provisions
surely
they
had
ten
thousand
regrets
at
disturbing
him
in
this
manner
they
expanded
to
him
the
intimation
that
he
must
clear
out
and
cease
to
clog
the
wheels
of
trade
blythe
stepped
from
the
platform
with
the
air
of
a
prince
leaving
his
canopied
couch
he
never
quite
lost
that
air
even
at
the
lowest
point
of
his
fall
it
is
clear
that
the
college
of
good
breeding
does
not
necessarily
maintain
a
chair
of
morals
within
its
walls
blythe
shook
out
his
wry
clothing
and
moved
slowly
up
the
calle
grande
through
the
hot
sand
he
moved
without
a
destination
in
his
mind
the
little
town
was
languidly
stirring
to
its
daily
life
babies
tumbled
over
one
another
in
the
grass
the
sea
breeze
brought
him
appetite
but
nothing
to
satisfy
it
throughout
coralio
were
its
morning
odors
those
from
the
heavily
fragrant
tropical
flowers
and
from
the
bread
baking
in
the
outdoor
ovens
of
clay
and
the
pervading
smoke
of
their
fires
where
the
smoke
cleared
the
crystal
air
with
some
of
the
efficacy
of
faith
seemed
to
remove
the
mountains
almost
to
the
sea
bringing
them
so
near
that
one
might
count
the
scarred
glades
on
their
wooded
sides
the
caribs
were
swiftly
gliding
to
their
tasks
at
the
waterside
already
along
the
bosky
trails
from
the
banana
groves
files
of
horses
were
slowly
moving
concealed
except
for
their
nodding
heads
and
plodding
legs
by
the
bunches
of
fruit
heaped
upon
their
backs
on
doorsills
sat
women
combing
their
long
black
hair
and
calling
one
to
another
across
the
narrow
thoroughfares
peace
reigned
in
coralio
arid
and
bald
peace
but
still
peace
on
that
bright
morning
when
nature
seemed
to
be
offering
the
lotus
on
the
dawn
golden
platter
beelzebub
blythe
had
reached
rock
bottom
further
descent
seemed
impossible
that
last
night
slumber
in
a
public
place
had
done
for
him
as
long
as
he
had
had
a
roof
to
cover
him
there
had
remained
unbridged
the
space
that
separates
a
gentleman
from
the
beasts
of
the
jungle
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
but
now
he
was
little
more
than
a
whimpering
oyster
led
to
be
devoured
on
the
sands
of
a
southern
sea
by
the
artful
walrus
circumstance
and
the
implacable
carpenter
fate
to
blythe
money
was
now
but
a
memory
he
had
drained
his
friends
of
all
that
their
had
to
offer
then
he
had
squeezed
them
to
the
last
drop
of
their
generosity
and
at
the
last
he
had
smitten
the
rock
of
their
hardening
bosoms
for
the
scattering
ignoble
drops
of
charity
itself
he
had
exhausted
his
credit
to
the
last
with
the
minute
keenness
of
the
shameless
sponger
he
was
aware
of
every
source
in
coralio
from
which
a
glass
of
rum
a
meal
or
a
piece
of
silver
could
be
wheedled
marshalling
each
such
source
in
his
mind
he
considered
it
with
all
the
thoroughness
and
penetration
that
hunger
and
thirst
lent
him
for
the
task
all
his
optimism
failed
to
thresh
a
grain
of
hope
from
the
chaff
of
his
postulations
he
had
played
out
the
game
that
one
night
in
the
open
had
shaken
his
nerves
until
then
there
had
been
left
to
him
at
least
a
few
grounds
upon
which
he
could
base
his
unblushing
demands
upon
his
neighbours
stores
now
he
must
beg
instead
of
borrowing
the
most
brazen
sophistry
could
not
dignify
by
the
name
of
loan
the
coin
contemptuously
flung
to
a
beachcomber
who
slept
on
the
bare
boards
of
the
public
market
but
on
this
morning
no
beggar
would
have
more
thankfully
received
a
charitable
coin
for
the
demon
thirst
had
him
by
the
throat
the
drunkard
matutinal
thirst
that
requires
to
be
slaked
at
each
morning
station
on
the
road
to
tophet
blythe
walked
slowly
up
the
street
keeping
a
watchful
eye
for
any
miracle
that
might
drop
manna
upon
him
in
his
wilderness
as
he
passed
the
popular
eating
house
of
madama
vasquez
madama
boarders
were
just
sitting
down
to
bread
pines
and
delicious
coffee
that
sent
forth
odorous
guarantee
of
its
quality
upon
the
breeze
madama
was
serving
she
turned
her
shy
stolid
melancholy
gaze
for
a
moment
out
the
window
she
saw
blythe
and
her
expression
turned
more
shy
and
embarrassed
beelzebub
owed
her
twenty
he
bowed
as
he
had
once
bowed
to
less
embarrassed
dames
to
whom
he
owed
nothing
and
passed
on
merchants
and
their
clerks
were
throwing
open
the
solid
wooden
doors
of
their
shops
polite
but
cool
were
the
glances
they
cast
upon
blythe
as
he
lounged
tentatively
by
with
the
remains
of
his
old
jaunty
air
for
they
were
his
creditors
almost
without
exception
at
the
little
fountain
in
the
he
made
an
apology
for
a
toilet
with
his
wetted
handkerchief
across
the
open
square
filed
the
dolorous
line
of
friends
of
the
prisoners
in
the
bearing
the
morning
meal
of
the
immured
the
food
in
their
hands
aroused
small
longing
in
blythe
it
was
drink
that
his
soul
craved
or
money
to
buy
it
in
the
streets
he
met
many
with
whom
he
had
been
friends
and
equals
and
whose
patience
and
liberality
he
had
gradually
exhausted
willard
geddie
and
paula
cantered
past
him
with
the
coolest
of
nods
returning
from
their
daily
horseback
ride
along
the
old
indian
road
keogh
passed
him
at
another
corner
whistling
cheerfully
and
bearing
a
prize
of
eggs
for
the
breakfast
of
himself
and
clancy
the
jovial
scout
of
fortune
was
one
of
blythe
victims
who
had
plunged
his
hand
oftenest
into
his
pocket
to
aid
him
but
now
it
seemed
that
keogh
too
had
fortified
himself
against
further
invasions
his
curt
greeting
and
the
ominous
light
in
his
full
grey
eye
quickened
the
steps
of
beelzebub
whom
desperation
had
almost
incited
to
attempt
an
additional
loan
three
drinking
shops
the
forlorn
one
next
visited
in
succession
in
all
of
these
his
money
his
credit
and
his
welcome
had
long
since
been
spent
but
blythe
felt
that
he
would
have
fawned
in
the
dust
at
the
feet
of
an
enemy
that
morning
for
one
draught
of
in
two
of
the
his
courageous
petition
for
drink
was
met
with
a
refusal
so
polite
that
it
stung
worse
than
abuse
the
third
establishment
had
acquired
something
of
american
methods
and
here
he
was
seized
bodily
and
cast
out
upon
his
hands
and
knees
this
physical
indignity
caused
a
singular
change
in
the
man
as
he
picked
himself
up
and
walked
away
an
expression
of
absolute
relief
came
upon
his
features
the
specious
and
conciliatory
smile
that
had
been
graven
there
was
succeeded
by
a
look
of
calm
and
sinister
resolve
beelzebub
had
been
floundering
in
the
sea
of
improbity
holding
by
a
slender
to
the
respectable
world
that
had
cast
him
overboard
he
must
have
felt
that
with
this
ultimate
shock
the
line
had
snapped
and
have
experienced
the
welcome
ease
of
the
drowning
swimmer
who
has
ceased
to
struggle
blythe
walked
to
the
next
corner
and
stood
there
while
he
brushed
the
sand
from
his
garments
and
his
glasses
i
got
to
do
it
oh
i
got
to
do
it
he
told
himself
aloud
if
i
had
a
quart
of
rum
i
believe
i
could
stave
it
off
yet
for
a
little
while
but
there
no
more
rum
for
as
they
call
me
by
the
flames
of
tartarus
if
i
to
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
satan
somebody
has
got
to
pay
the
court
expenses
you
have
to
pony
up
frank
goodwin
you
a
good
fellow
but
a
gentleman
must
draw
the
line
at
being
kicked
into
the
gutter
blackmail
is
a
pretty
word
but
it
the
next
station
on
the
road
i
travelling
with
purpose
in
his
steps
blythe
now
moved
rapidly
through
the
town
by
way
of
its
landward
environs
he
passed
through
the
squalid
quarters
of
the
improvident
negroes
and
on
beyond
the
picturesque
shacks
of
the
poorer
from
many
points
along
his
course
he
could
see
through
the
umbrageous
glades
the
house
of
frank
goodwin
on
its
wooded
hill
and
as
he
crossed
the
little
bridge
over
the
lagoon
he
saw
the
old
indian
galvez
scrubbing
at
the
wooden
slab
that
bore
the
name
of
miraflores
beyond
the
lagoon
the
lands
of
goodwin
began
to
slope
gently
upward
a
grassy
road
shaded
by
a
munificent
and
diverse
array
of
tropical
flora
wound
from
the
edge
of
an
outlying
banana
grove
to
the
dwelling
blythe
took
this
road
with
long
and
purposeful
strides
goodwin
was
seated
on
his
coolest
gallery
dictating
letters
to
his
secretary
a
sallow
and
capable
native
youth
the
household
adhered
to
the
american
plan
of
breakfast
and
that
meal
had
been
a
thing
of
the
past
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
the
castaway
walked
to
the
steps
and
flourished
a
hand
good
morning
blythe
said
goodwin
looking
up
come
in
and
have
a
chair

i
can
do
for
you
i
want
to
speak
to
you
in
private
goodwin
nodded
at
his
secretary
who
strolled
out
under
a
mango
tree
and
lit
a
cigarette
blythe
took
the
chair
that
he
had
left
vacant
i
want
some
money
he
began
doggedly
i

goodwin
with
equal
directness
but

to
death
blythe
your
friends

done
all
they
could
to
help
you

brace
up

wo
help
yourself
there

use
furnishing
you
with
money
to
ruin
yourself
with
any
longer
dear
man
said
blythe
tilting
back
his
chair
it
is
a
question
of
social
economy
now

past
that
i
like
you
goodwin
and
come
to
stick
a
knife
between
your
ribs
i
was
kicked
out
of
saloon
this
morning
and
society
owes
me
reparation
for
my
wounded
feelings
i
did
kick
you
out
no
but
in
a
general
way
you
represent
society
and
in
a
particular
way
you
represent
my
last
chance
i
had
to
come
down
to
it
old
man
i
tried
to
do
it
a
month
ago
when
losada
man
was
here
turning
things
over
but
i
could
do
it
then
now
it
different
i
want
a
thousand
dollars
goodwin
and
you
have
to
give
it
to
me
only
last
week
said
goodwin
with
a
smile
a
silver
dollar
was
all
you
were
asking
for
an
evidence
said
blythe
flippantly
that
i
was
still
virtuous
though
under
heavy
pressure
the
wages
of
sin
should
be
something
higher
than
a
worth
cents
let
talk
business
i
am
the
villain
in
the
third
act
and
i
must
have
my
merited
if
only
temporary
triumph
i
saw
you
collar
the
late
president
valiseful
of
boodle
oh
i
know
it
blackmail
but
liberal
about
the
price
i
know
i
a
cheap
villain
one
of
the
regular
kind
but
you
one
of
my
particular
friends
and
i
do
want
to
stick
you
hard
suppose
you
go
into
the
details
suggested
goodwin
calmly
arranging
his
letters
on
the
table
all
right
said
beelzebub
i
like
the
way
you
take
it
i
despise
histrionics
so
you
will
please
prepare
yourself
for
the
facts
without
any
red
fire
calcium
or
grace
notes
on
the
saxophone
on
the
night
that
his
excellency
arrived
in
town
i
was
very
drunk
you
will
excuse
the
pride
with
which
i
state
that
fact
but
it
was
quite
a
feat
for
me
to
attain
that
desirable
state
somebody
had
left
a
cot
out
under
the
orange
trees
in
the
yard
of
madama
ortiz
hotel
i
stepped
over
the
wall
laid
down
upon
it
and
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
an
orange
that
dropped
from
the
tree
upon
my
nose
and
i
laid
there
for
awhile
cursing
sir
isaac
newton
or
whoever
it
was
that
invented
gravitation
for
not
confining
his
theory
to
apples
and
then
along
came
miraflores
and
his
with
the
treasury
in
a
valise
and
went
into
the
hotel
next
you
hove
in
sight
and
held
a
with
the
tonsorial
artist
who
insisted
upon
talking
shop
after
hours
i
tried
to
slumber
again
but
once
more
my
rest
was
disturbed
this
time
by
the
noise
of
the
popgun
that
went
off
upstairs
then
that
valise
came
crashing
down
into
an
orange
tree
just
above
my
head
and
i
arose
from
my
couch
not
knowing
when
it
might
begin
to
rain
saratoga
trunks
when
the
army
and
the
constabulary
began
to
arrive
with
their
medals
and
decorations
hastily
pinned
to
their
pajamas
and
their
snickersnees
drawn
i
crawled
into
the
welcome
shadow
of
a
banana
plant
i
remained
there
for
an
hour
by
which
time
the
excitement
and
the
people
had
cleared
away
and
then
my
dear
goodwin
excuse
me
i
saw
you
sneak
back
and
pluck
that
ripe
and
juicy
valise
from
the
orange
tree
i
followed
you
and
saw
you
take
it
to
your
own
house
a
crop
from
one
orange
tree
in
a
season
about
breaks
the
record
of
the
industry
being
a
gentleman
at
that
time
of
course
i
never
mentioned
the
incident
to
anyone
but
this
morning
i
was
kicked
out
of
a
saloon
my
code
of
honour
is
all
out
at
the
elbows
and
i
sell
my
for
three
fingers
of
i
not
putting
on
the
screws
hard
it
ought
to
be
worth
a
thousand
to
you
for
me
to
have
slept
on
that
cot
through
the
whole
business
without
waking
up
and
seeing
anything
goodwin
opened
two
more
letters
and
made
memoranda
in
pencil
on
them
then
he
called
manuel
to
his
secretary
who
came
spryly
the
when
does
she
sail
asked
goodwin
señor
answered
the
youth
at
three
this
afternoon
she
drops
to
punta
soledad
to
complete
her
cargo
of
fruit
from
there
she
sails
for
new
orleans
without
delay
said
goodwin
these
letters
may
wait
yet
awhile
the
secretary
returned
to
his
cigarette
under
the
mango
tree
in
round
numbers
said
goodwin
facing
blythe
squarely
how
much
money
do
you
owe
in
this
town
not
including
the
sums
you
have
from
me
five
hundred
at
a
rough
guess
answered
blythe
lightly
go
somewhere
in
the
town
and
draw
up
a
schedule
of
your
debts
said
goodwin
come
back
here
in
two
hours
and
i
will
send
manuel
with
the
money
to
pay
them
i
will
also
have
a
decent
outfit
of
clothing
ready
for
you
you
will
sail
on
the
at
three
manuel
will
accompany
you
as
far
as
the
deck
of
the
steamer
there
he
will
hand
you
one
thousand
dollars
in
cash
i
suppose
that
we
need
discuss
what
you
will
be
expected
to
do
in
return
oh
i
understand
piped
blythe
cheerily
i
was
asleep
all
the
time
on
the
cot
under
madama
ortiz
orange
trees
and
i
shake
off
the
dust
of
coralio
forever
i
play
fair
no
more
of
the
lotus
for
me
your
proposition
is
you
a
good
fellow
goodwin
and
i
let
you
off
light
i
agree
to
everything
but
in
the
meantime
i
a
devil
of
a
thirst
on
old
man
not
a
said
goodwin
firmly
until
you
are
on
board
the
you
would
be
drunk
in
thirty
minutes
if
you
had
money
now
but
he
noticed
the
eyeballs
the
relaxed
form
and
the
shaking
hands
of
beelzebub
and
he
stepped
into
the
dining
room
through
the
low
window
and
brought
out
a
glass
and
a
decanter
of
brandy
take
a
bracer
anyway
before
you
go
he
proposed
even
as
a
man
to
the
friend
whom
he
entertains
beelzebub
blythe
eyes
glistened
at
the
sight
of
the
solace
for
which
his
soul
burned
for
the
first
time
his
poisoned
nerves
had
been
denied
their
steadying
dose
and
their
retort
was
a
mounting
torment
he
grasped
the
decanter
and
rattled
its
crystal
mouth
against
the
glass
in
his
trembling
hand
he
flushed
the
glass
and
then
stood
erect
holding
it
aloft
for
an
instant
for
one
fleeting
moment
he
held
his
head
above
the
drowning
waves
of
his
abyss
he
nodded
easily
at
goodwin
raised
his
brimming
glass
and
murmured
a
health
that
men
had
used
in
his
ancient
paradise
lost
and
then
so
suddenly
that
he
spilled
the
brandy
over
his
hand
he
set
down
his
glass
untasted
in
two
hours
his
dry
lips
muttered
to
goodwin
as
he
marched
down
the
steps
and
turned
his
face
toward
the
town
in
the
edge
of
the
cool
banana
grove
beelzebub
halted
and
snapped
the
tongue
of
his
belt
buckle
into
another
hole
i
could
do
it
he
explained
feverishly
to
the
waving
banana
fronds
i
wanted
to
but
i
could
a
gentleman
ca
drink
with
the
man
that
he
blackmails
xii
shoes
john
de
graffenreid
atwood
ate
of
the
lotus
root
stem
and
flower
the
tropics
gobbled
him
up
he
plunged
enthusiastically
into
his
work
which
was
to
try
to
forget
rosine
now
they
who
dine
on
the
lotus
rarely
consume
it
plain
there
is
a
sauce
that
goes
with
it
and
the
distillers
are
the
chefs
who
prepare
it
and
on
johnny
menu
card
it
read
brandy
with
a
bottle
between
them
he
and
billy
keogh
would
sit
on
the
porch
of
the
little
consulate
at
night
and
roar
out
great
indecorous
songs
until
the
natives
slipping
hastily
past
would
shrug
a
shoulder
and
mutter
things
to
themselves
about
the
one
day
johnny
brought
the
mail
and
dumped
it
on
the
table
johnny
leaned
from
his
hammock
and
fingered
the
four
or
five
letters
dejectedly
keogh
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
chopping
lazily
with
a
paper
knife
at
the
legs
of
a
centipede
that
was
crawling
among
the
stationery
johnny
was
in
that
phase
of
when
all
the
world
tastes
bitter
in
one
mouth
same
old
thing
he
complained
fool
people
writing
for
information
about
the
country
they
want
to
know
all
about
raising
fruit
and
how
to
make
a
fortune
without
work
half
of
do
even
send
stamps
for
a
reply
they
think
a
consul
has
anything
to
do
but
write
letters
slit
those
envelopes
for
me
old
man
and
see
what
they
want
i
feeling
too
rocky
to
move
keogh
acclimated
beyond
all
possibility
of
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
with
smiling
compliance
on
his
countenance
and
began
to
slit
open
the
letters
four
of
them
were
from
citizens
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
who
seemed
to
regard
the
consul
at
coralio
as
a
cyclopædia
of
information
they
asked
long
lists
of
questions
numerically
arranged
about
the
climate
products
possibilities
laws
business
chances
and
statistics
of
the
country
in
which
the
consul
had
the
honour
of
representing
his
own
government
write
please
billy
said
that
inert
official
just
a
line
referring
them
to
the
latest
consular
report
tell
the
state
department
will
be
delighted
to
furnish
the
literary
gems
sign
my
name
do
let
your
pen
scratch
billy
it
keep
me
awake
do
snore
said
keogh
amiably
and
i
do
your
work
for
you
you
need
a
corps
of
assistants
anyhow
do
see
how
you
ever
get
out
a
report
wake
up
a
minute
here
one
more
letter
it
from
your
own
town
too
dalesburg
that
so
murmured
johnny
showing
a
mild
and
obligatory
interest
what
it
about
postmaster
writes
explained
keogh
says
a
citizen
of
the
town
wants
some
facts
and
advice
from
you
says
the
citizen
has
an
idea
in
his
head
of
coming
down
where
you
are
and
opening
a
shoe
store
wants
to
know
if
you
think
the
business
would
pay
says
he
heard
of
the
boom
along
this
coast
and
wants
to
get
in
on
the
ground
floor
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
his
bad
temper
johnny
hammock
swayed
with
his
laughter
keogh
laughed
too
and
the
pet
monkey
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
bookcase
chattered
in
shrill
sympathy
with
the
ironical
reception
of
the
letter
from
dalesburg
great
bunions
exclaimed
the
consul
shoe
store
what
they
ask
about
next
i
wonder
overcoat
factory
i
reckon
say
billy
of
our
citizens
how
many
do
you
suppose
ever
had
on
a
pair
of
shoes
keogh
reflected
judicially
let
see
there
you
and
me
and
not
me
said
johnny
promptly
and
incorrectly
holding
up
a
foot
encased
in
a
disreputable
deerskin
i
have
been
a
victim
to
shoes
in
months
but
you
got
though
went
on
keogh
and
there
goodwin
and
blanchard
and
geddie
and
old
lutz
and
doc
gregg
and
that
italian
that
agent
for
the
banana
company
and
there
old
delgado
no
he
wears
sandals
and
oh
yes
there
madama
ortiz
kapes
the
hotel
she
had
on
a
pair
of
red
slippers
at
the
the
other
night
and
miss
pasa
her
daughter
that
went
to
school
in
the
states
she
brought
back
some
civilized
notions
in
the
way
of
footgear
and
there
the
sister
that
dresses
up
her
feet
on
and
geddie
who
wears
a
two
with
a
castilian
instep
and
that
about
all
the
ladies
let
see
do
some
of
the
soldiers
at
the
no
that
so
they
allowed
shoes
only
when
on
the
march
in
barracks
they
turn
their
little
toeses
out
to
grass
right
agreed
the
consul
not
over
twenty
out
of
the
three
thousand
ever
felt
leather
on
their
walking
arrangements
oh
yes
coralio
is
just
the
town
for
an
enterprising
shoe
store
that
want
to
part
with
its
goods
wonder
if
old
patterson
is
trying
to
jolly
me
he
always
was
full
of
things
he
called
jokes
write
him
a
letter
billy
i
dictate
it
we
jolly
him
back
a
few
keogh
dipped
his
pen
and
wrote
at
johnny
dictation
with
many
pauses
filled
in
with
smoke
and
sundry
travellings
of
the
bottle
and
glasses
the
following
reply
to
the
dalesburg
communication
was
perpetrated
obadiah
patterson
dalesburg
sir
in
reply
to
your
favour
of
july
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
according
to
my
opinion
there
is
no
place
on
the
habitable
globe
that
presents
to
the
eye
stronger
evidence
of
the
need
of
a
shoe
store
than
does
the
town
of
coralio
there
are
inhabitants
in
the
place
and
not
a
single
shoe
store
the
situation
speaks
for
itself
this
coast
is
rapidly
becoming
the
goal
of
enterprising
business
men
but
the
shoe
business
is
one
that
has
been
sadly
overlooked
or
neglected
in
fact
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
our
citizens
actually
without
shoes
at
present
besides
the
want
above
mentioned
there
is
also
a
crying
need
for
a
brewery
a
college
of
higher
mathematics
a
coal
yard
and
a
clean
and
intellectual
punch
and
judy
show
i
have
the
honour
to
be
sir
your
obt
servant
john
de
graffenreid
atwood
consul
at
coralio
hello
uncle
obadiah
how
the
old
burg
racking
along
what
would
the
government
do
without
you
and
me
look
out
for
a
parrot
and
a
bunch
of
bananas
soon
from
your
old
friend
johnny
i
throw
in
that
postscript
explained
the
consul
so
uncle
obadiah
wo
take
offence
at
the
official
tone
of
the
letter
now
billy
you
get
that
correspondence
fixed
up
and
send
pancho
to
the
with
it
the
takes
the
mail
out
if
they
make
up
that
load
of
fruit
the
night
programme
in
coralio
never
varied
the
recreations
of
the
people
were
soporific
and
flat
they
wandered
about
barefoot
and
aimless
speaking
lowly
and
smoking
cigar
or
cigarette
looking
down
on
the
dimly
lighted
ways
one
seemed
to
see
a
threading
maze
of
brunette
ghosts
tangled
with
a
procession
of
insane
fireflies
in
some
houses
the
thrumming
of
lugubrious
guitars
added
to
the
depression
of
the
night
giant
rattled
in
the
foliage
as
loudly
as
the
end
man
bones
in
a
minstrel
troupe
by
nine
the
streets
were
almost
deserted
nor
at
the
consulate
was
there
often
a
change
of
bill
keogh
would
come
there
nightly
for
coralio
one
cool
place
was
the
little
seaward
porch
of
that
official
residence
the
brandy
would
be
kept
moving
and
before
midnight
sentiment
would
begin
to
stir
in
the
heart
of
the
consul
then
he
would
relate
to
keogh
the
story
of
his
ended
romance
each
night
keogh
would
listen
patiently
to
the
tale
and
be
ready
with
untiring
sympathy
but
do
you
think
for
a
minute
thus
johnny
would
always
conclude
his
woeful
narrative
that
i
grieving
about
that
girl
billy
forgotten
her
she
never
enters
my
mind
if
she
were
to
enter
that
door
right
now
my
pulse
would
gain
a
beat
that
all
over
long
ago
do
i
know
it
keogh
would
answer
of
course
you
forgotten
her
proper
thing
to
do
was
quite
of
her
to
listen
to
the
knocks
that
er
dink
pawson
kept
giving
you
pink
dawson
a
world
of
contempt
would
be
in
johnny
tones
poor
white
trash
that
what
he
was
had
five
hundred
acres
of
farming
land
though
and
that
counted
maybe
i
have
a
chance
to
get
back
at
him
some
day
the
dawsons
were
anybody
everybody
in
alabama
knows
the
atwoods
say
billy
did
you
know
my
mother
was
a
de
graffenreid
why
no
keogh
would
say
is
that
so
he
had
heard
it
some
three
hundred
times
fact
the
de
graffenreids
of
hancock
county
but
i
never
think
of
that
girl
any
more
do
i
billy
not
for
a
minute
my
boy
would
be
the
last
sounds
heard
by
the
conqueror
of
cupid
at
this
point
johnny
would
fall
into
a
gentle
slumber
and
keogh
would
saunter
out
to
his
own
shack
under
the
calabash
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
plaza
in
a
day
or
two
the
letter
from
the
dalesburg
postmaster
and
its
answer
had
been
forgotten
by
the
coralio
exiles
but
on
the
day
of
july
the
fruit
of
the
reply
appeared
upon
the
tree
of
events
the
a
fruit
steamer
that
visited
coralio
regularly
drew
into
the
offing
and
anchored
the
beach
was
lined
with
spectators
while
the
quarantine
doctor
and
the
crew
rowed
out
to
attend
to
their
duties
an
hour
later
billy
keogh
lounged
into
the
consulate
clean
and
cool
in
his
linen
clothes
and
grinning
like
a
pleased
shark
guess
what
he
said
to
johnny
lounging
in
his
hammock
too
hot
to
guess
said
johnny
lazily
your
man
come
said
keogh
rolling
the
sweet
morsel
on
his
tongue
with
a
stock
of
goods
big
enough
to
supply
the
continent
as
far
down
as
terra
del
fuego
they
carting
his
cases
over
to
the
now
six
barges
full
they
brought
ashore
and
have
paddled
back
for
the
rest
oh
ye
saints
in
glory
wo
there
be
regalements
in
the
air
when
he
gets
onto
the
joke
and
has
an
interview
with
consul
it
be
worth
nine
years
in
the
tropics
just
to
witness
that
one
joyful
moment
keogh
loved
to
take
his
mirth
easily
he
selected
a
clean
place
on
the
matting
and
lay
upon
the
floor
the
walls
shook
with
his
enjoyment
johnny
turned
half
over
and
blinked
do
tell
me
he
said
that
anybody
was
fool
enough
to
take
that
letter
seriously
stock
of
goods
gasped
keogh
in
ecstasy
talk
about
coals
to
newcastle
why
did
he
take
a
of
fans
to
spitzbergen
while
he
was
about
it
saw
the
old
codger
on
the
beach
you
ought
to
have
been
there
when
he
put
on
his
specs
and
squinted
at
the
five
hundred
or
so
barefooted
citizens
standing
around
are
you
telling
the
truth
billy
asked
the
consul
weakly
am
i
you
ought
to
see
the
buncoed
gentleman
daughter
he
brought
along
looks
she
makes
the
señoritas
here
look
like

on
said
johnny
if
you
can
stop
that
asinine
giggling
i
hate
to
see
a
grown
man
make
a
laughing
hyena
of
himself
name
is
hemstetter
went
on
keogh
he
a
hello
what
the
matter
now
johnny
moccasined
feet
struck
the
floor
with
a
thud
as
he
wriggled
out
of
his
hammock
get
up

idiot
he
said
sternly
or
i
brain

inkstand

keogh
rose
and
dusted
himself
he
managed
to
regain
a
decorous
demeanour
situation
has
got
to
be
met
johnny
he
said
with
some
success
at
seriousness
i
did
think
about
its
being
your
girl
until
you
spoke
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
them
comfortable
quarters
you
go
down
and

music
and
i

to
goodwin
and
see
if
goodwin

got
the
decentest
house

town

billy
said
the
consul
i
knew
you
would
desert
me
the
world
bound
to
come
to
an
end
but
maybe
we
can
stave
it
off
for
a
day
or
two
keogh
hoisted
his
umbrella
and
set
out
for
goodwin
house
johnny
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
he
picked
up
the
brandy
bottle
but
set
it
down
again
without
drinking
and
marched
bravely
down
to
the
beach
in
the
shade
of
the
walls
he
found
hemstetter
and
rosine
surrounded
by
a
mass
of
gaping
citizens
the
customs
officers
were
ducking
and
scraping
while
the
captain
of
the
interpreted
the
business
of
the
new
arrivals
rosine
looked
healthy
and
very
much
alive
she
was
gazing
at
the
strange
scenes
around
her
with
amused
interest
there
was
a
faint
blush
upon
her
round
cheek
as
she
greeted
her
old
admirer
hemstetter
shook
hands
with
johnny
in
a
very
friendly
way
he
was
an
oldish
impractical
man
one
of
that
numerous
class
of
erratic
business
men
who
are
forever
dissatisfied
and
seeking
a
change
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
john
may
i
call
you
john
he
said
let
me
thank
you
for
your
prompt
answer
to
our
postmaster
letter
of
inquiry
he
volunteered
to
write
to
you
on
my
behalf
i
was
looking
about
for
something
different
in
the
way
of
a
business
in
which
the
profits
would
be
greater
i
had
noticed
in
the
papers
that
this
coast
was
receiving
much
attention
from
investors
i
am
extremely
grateful
for
your
advice
to
come
i
sold
out
everything
that
i
possess
and
invested
the
proceeds
in
as
fine
a
stock
of
shoes
as
could
be
bought
in
the
north
you
have
a
picturesque
town
here
john
i
hope
business
will
be
as
good
as
your
letter
justifies
me
in
expecting
johnny
agony
was
abbreviated
by
the
arrival
of
keogh
who
hurried
up
with
the
news
that
goodwin
would
be
much
pleased
to
place
rooms
at
the
disposal
of
hemstetter
and
his
daughter
so
there
hemstetter
and
rosine
were
at
once
conducted
and
left
to
recuperate
from
the
fatigue
of
the
voyage
while
johnny
went
down
to
see
that
the
cases
of
shoes
were
safely
stored
in
the
customs
warehouse
pending
their
examination
by
the
officials
keogh
grinning
like
a
shark
skirmished
about
to
find
goodwin
to
instruct
him
not
to
expose
to
hemstetter
the
true
state
of
coralio
as
a
shoe
market
until
johnny
had
been
given
a
chance
to
redeem
the
situation
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
that
night
the
consul
and
keogh
held
a
desperate
consultation
on
the
breezy
porch
of
the
consulate
send
back
home
began
keogh
reading
johnny
thoughts
i
would
said
johnny
after
a
little
silence
but
i
been
lying
to
you
billy
all
right
about
that
said
keogh
affably
i
told
you
hundreds
of
times
said
johnny
slowly
that
i
had
forgotten
that
girl
have
i
about
three
hundred
and
admitted
the
monument
of
patience
i
lied
repeated
the
consul
every
time
i
never
forgot
her
for
one
minute
i
was
an
obstinate
ass
for
running
away
just
because
she
said
once
and
i
was
too
proud
a
fool
to
go
back
i
talked
with
rosine
a
few
minutes
this
evening
up
at
goodwin
i
found
out
one
thing
you
remember
that
farmer
fellow
who
was
always
after
her
dink
pawson
asked
keogh
pink
dawson
well
he
was
a
hill
of
beans
to
her
she
says
she
did
believe
a
word
of
the
things
he
told
her
about
me
but
sewed
up
now
billy
that
tomfool
letter
we
sent
ruined
whatever
chance
i
had
left
she
despise
me
when
she
finds
out
that
her
old
father
has
been
made
the
victim
of
a
joke
that
a
decent
school
boy
would
have
been
guilty
of
shoes
why
he
could
sell
twenty
pairs
of
shoes
in
coralio
if
he
kept
store
here
for
twenty
years
you
put
a
pair
of
shoes
on
one
of
these
caribs
or
spanish
brown
boys
and
what
he
do
stand
on
his
head
and
squeal
until
he
kicked
off
none
of
ever
wore
shoes
and
they
never
will
if
i
send
back
home
i
have
to
tell
the
whole
story
and
what
she
think
of
me
i
want
that
girl
worse
than
ever
billy
and
now
when
she
in
reach
i
lost
her
forever
because
i
tried
to
be
funny
when
the
thermometer
was
at
keep
cheerful
said
the
optimistic
keogh
and
let
open
the
store
i
been
busy
myself
this
afternoon

can
stir
up
a
temporary
boom
in
anyhow

the
geddies

another
wreck
to
the
credit
of
the
gorgeous
tropics
keogh
left
feeling
that
he
could
be
of
no
use
johnny
laid
a
handful
of
cigars
on
a
table
and
stretched
himself
in
a
steamer
chair
when
the
sudden
daylight
broke
silvering
the
harbour
ripples
he
was
still
sitting
there
then
he
got
up
whistling
a
little
tune
and
took
his
bath
at
nine
he
walked
down
to
the
dingy
little
cable
office
and
hung
for
half
an
hour
over
a
blank
the
result
of
his
application
was
the
following
message
which
he
signed
and
had
transmitted
at
a
cost
of

a
suitable

had
been
secured
in
the
calle
grande
and
hemstetter
stock
of
shoes
arranged
upon
their
shelves
the
rent
of
the
store
was
moderate
and
the
stock
made
a
fine
showing
of
neat
white
boxes
attractively
displayed
johnny
friends
stood
by
him
loyally
on
the
first
day
keogh
strolled
into
the
store
in
a
casual
kind
of
way
about
once
every
hour
and
bought
shoes
after
he
had
purchased
a
pair
each
of
extension
soles
congress
gaiters
button
kids
calfs
dancing
pumps
rubber
boots
tans
of
various
hues
tennis
shoes
and
flowered
slippers
he
sought
out
johnny
to
be
prompted
as
to
names
of
other
kinds
that
he
might
inquire
for
the
other
residents
also
played
their
parts
nobly
by
buying
often
and
liberally
keogh
was
grand
marshal
and
made
them
distribute
their
patronage
thus
keeping
up
a
fair
run
of
custom
for
several
days
hemstetter
was
gratified
by
the
amount
of
business
done
thus
far
but
expressed
surprise
that
the
natives
were
so
backward
with
their
custom
oh
they
awfully
shy
explained
johnny
as
he
wiped
his
forehead
nervously
they
get
the
habit
pretty
soon
they
come
with
a
rush
when
they
do
come
one
afternoon
keogh
dropped
into
the
consul
office
chewing
an
unlighted
cigar
thoughtfully
got
anything
up
your
sleeve
he
inquired
of
johnny
if
you
have
it
about
time
to
show
it
if
you
can
borrow
some
gent
hat
in
the
audience
and
make
a
lot
of
customers
for
an
idle
stock
of
shoes
come
out
of
it
you
better
spiel
the
boys
have
all
laid
in
enough
footwear
to
last
ten
years
and
there
nothing
doing
in
the
shoe
store
but
dolcy
far
nienty
i
just
came
by
there
your
venerable
victim
was
standing
in
the
door
gazing
through
his
specs
at
the
bare
toes
passing
by
his
emporium
the
natives
here
have
got
the
true
artistic
temperament
me
and
clancy
took
eighteen
tintypes
this
morning
in
two
hours
there
been
but
one
pair
of
shoes
sold
all
day
blanchard
went
in
and
bought
a
pair
of
because
he
thought
he
saw
miss
hemstetter
go
into
the
store
i
saw
him
throw
the
slippers
into
the
lagoon
afterwards
there
a
mobile
fruit
steamer
coming
in
or
next
day
said
johnny
we
ca
do
anything
until
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
try
to
create
a
demand
political
economy
is
your
strong
point
said
the
consul
impudently
you
ca
create
a
demand
but
you
can
create
a
necessity
for
a
demand
that
what
i
am
going
to
do
two
weeks
after
the
consul
sent
his
cable
a
fruit
steamer
brought
him
a
huge
mysterious
brown
bale
of
some
unknown
commodity
influence
with
the
people
was
sufficiently
strong
for
him
to
get
the
goods
turned
over
to
him
without
the
usual
inspection
he
had
the
bale
taken
to
the
consulate
and
snugly
stowed
in
the
back
room
that
night
he
ripped
open
a
corner
of
it
and
took
out
a
handful
of
the
cockleburrs
he
examined
them
with
the
care
with
which
a
warrior
examines
his
arms
before
he
goes
forth
to
battle
for
his
and
life
the
burrs
were
the
ripe
august
product
as
hard
as
filberts
and
bristling
with
spines
as
tough
and
sharp
as
needles
johnny
whistled
softly
a
little
tune
and
went
out
to
find
billy
keogh
later
in
the
night
when
coralio
was
steeped
in
slumber
he
and
billy
went
forth
into
the
deserted
streets
with
their
coats
bulging
like
balloons
all
up
and
down
the
calle
grande
they
went
sowing
the
sharp
burrs
carefully
in
the
sand
along
the
narrow
sidewalks
in
every
foot
of
grass
between
the
silent
houses
and
then
they
took
the
side
streets
and
missing
none
no
place
where
the
foot
of
man
woman
or
child
might
fall
was
slighted
many
trips
they
made
to
and
from
the
prickly
hoard
and
then
nearly
at
the
dawn
they
laid
themselves
down
to
rest
calmly
as
great
generals
do
after
planning
a
victory
according
to
the
revised
tactics
and
slept
knowing
that
they
had
sowed
with
the
accuracy
of
satan
sowing
tares
and
the
perseverance
of
paul
planting
with
the
rising
sun
came
the
purveyors
of
fruits
and
meats
and
arranged
their
wares
in
and
around
the
little
at
one
end
of
the
town
near
the
seashore
the
stood
and
the
sowing
of
the
burrs
had
not
been
carried
that
far
the
dealers
waited
long
past
the
hour
when
their
sales
usually
began
none
came
to
buy
hay
they
began
to
exclaim
one
to
another
at
their
accustomed
time
from
every
and
palm
hut
and
shack
and
dim
glided
women
black

brown
women
women
women
dun
and
yellow
and
tawny
they
were
the
marketers
starting
to
purchase
the
family
supply
of
cassava
plantains
meat
fowls
and
tortillas
décolleté
they
were
and
and
with
a
single
skirt
reaching
below
the
knee
stolid
and
they
stepped
from
their
doorways
into
the
narrow
paths
or
upon
the
soft
grass
of
the
streets
the
first
to
emerge
uttered
ambiguous
squeals
and
raised
one
foot
quickly
another
step
and
they
sat
down
with
shrill
cries
of
alarm
to
pick
at
the
new
and
painful
insects
that
had
stung
them
upon
the
feet
picadores
diablos
they
screeched
to
one
another
across
the
narrow
ways
some
tried
the
grass
instead
of
the
paths
but
there
they
were
also
stung
and
bitten
by
the
strange
little
prickly
balls
they
plumped
down
in
the
grass
and
added
their
lamentations
to
those
of
their
sisters
in
the
sandy
paths
all
through
the
town
was
heard
the
plaint
of
the
feminine
jabber
the
venders
in
the
market
still
wondered
why
no
customers
came
then
men
lords
of
the
earth
came
forth
they
too
began
to
hop
to
dance
to
limp
and
to
curse
they
stood
stranded
and
foolish
or
stooped
to
pluck
at
the
scourge
that
attacked
their
feet
and
ankles
some
loudly
proclaimed
the
pest
to
be
poisonous
spiders
of
an
unknown
species
and
then
the
children
ran
out
for
their
morning
romp
and
now
to
the
uproar
was
added
the
howls
of
limping
infants
and
cockleburred
childhood
every
minute
the
advancing
day
brought
forth
fresh
victims

stepped
from
her
honoured
doorway
as
was
her
daily
custom

procure

was
clad
in
a

a

wore

her
progress
was
majestic
for
were
not

she
made
across

and
set
her

upon

emitted
a
yowl
even
as
a
turning
about
she
fell
upon
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
ay
like
a
beast
of
the

she
crawled

attempted
to
convey
his
bulk
to
the
at
the
corner
of
the
plaza
in
order
to
assuage
his
matutinal
thirst
the
first
plunge
of
his
unshod
foot
into
the
cool
grass
struck
a
concealed
mine
don
ildefonso
fell
like
a
crumpled
cathedral
crying
out
that
he
had
been
fatally
bitten
by
a
deadly
scorpion
everywhere
were
the
shoeless
citizens
hopping
stumbling
limping
and
picking
from
their
feet
the
venomous
insects
that
had
come
in
a
single
night
to
harass
them
the
first
to
perceive
the
remedy
was
estebán
delgado
the
barber
a
man
of
travel
and
education
sitting
upon
a
stone
he
plucked
burrs
from
his
toes
and
made
oration
behold
my
friends
these
bugs
of
the
devil
i
know
them
well
they
soar
through
the
skies
in
swarms
like
pigeons
these
are
the
dead
ones
that
fell
during
the
night
in
yucatan
i
have
seen
them
as
large
as
oranges
yes
there
they
hiss
like
serpents
and
have
wings
like
bats
it
is
the
shoes
the
shoes
that
one
needs
zapatos
para
mi
estebán
hobbled
to
hemstetter
store
and
bought
shoes
coming
out
he
swaggered
down
the
street
with
impunity
reviling
loudly
the
bugs
of
the
devil
the
suffering
ones
sat
up
or
stood
upon
one
foot
and
beheld
the
immune
barber
men
women
and
children
took
up
the
cry
zapatos
the
necessity
for
the
demand
had
been
created
the
demand
followed
that
day
hemstetter
sold
three
hundred
pairs
of
shoes
it
is
really
surprising
he
said
to
johnny
who
came
up
in
the
evening
to
help
him
straighten
out
the
stock
how
trade
is
picking
up
yesterday
i
made
but
three
sales
i
told
you
they
whoop
things
up
when
they
got
started
said
the
consul
i
think
i
shall
order
a
dozen
more
cases
of
goods
to
keep
the
stock
up
said
hemstetter
beaming
through
his
spectacles
i
would
send
in
any
orders
yet
advised
johnny
wait
till
you
see
how
the
trade
holds
up
each
night
johnny
and
keogh
sowed
the
crop
that
grew
dollars
by
day
at
the
end
of
ten
days
of
the
stock
of
shoes
had
been
sold
and
the
stock
of
cockleburrs
was
exhausted
johnny
cabled
to
pink
dawson
for
another
pounds
paying
twenty
cents
per
pound
as
before
hemstetter
carefully
made
up
an
order
for
worth
of
shoes
from
northern
firms
johnny
hung
about
the
store
until
this
order
was
ready
for
the
mail
and
succeeded
in
destroying
it
before
it
reached
the
postoffice
that
night
he
took
rosine
under
the
mango
tree
by
goodwin
porch
and
confessed
everything
she
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
said
you
are
a
very
wicked
man
father
and
i
will
go
back
home
you
say
it
was
a
joke
i
think
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
argument
the
conversation
had
been
turned
upon
a
different
subject
the
two
were
considering
the
respective
merits
of
pale
blue
and
pink
wall
paper
with
which
the
old
colonial
mansion
of
the
atwoods
in
dalesburg
was
to
be
decorated
after
the
wedding
on
the
next
morning
johnny
confessed
to
hemstetter
the
shoe
merchant
put
on
his
spectacles
and
said
through
them
you
strike
me
as
being
a
most
extraordinary
young
scamp
if
i
had
not
managed
this
enterprise
with
good
business
judgment
my
entire
stock
of
goods
might
have
been
a
complete
loss
now
how
do
you
propose
to
dispose
of
the
rest
of
it
when
the
second
invoice
of
cockleburrs
arrived
johnny
loaded
them
and
the
remainder
of
the
shoes
into
a
schooner
and
sailed
down
the
coast
to
alazan
there
in
the
same
dark
and
diabolical
manner
he
repeated
his
success
and
came
back
with
a
bag
of
money
and
not
so
much
as
a
shoestring
and
then
he
besought
his
great
uncle
of
the
waving
goatee
and
starred
vest
to
accept
his
resignation
for
the
lotus
no
longer
lured
him
he
hankered
for
the
spinach
and
cress
of
dalesburg
the
services
of
william
terence
keogh
as
acting
consul
were
suggested
and
accepted
and
johnny
sailed
with
the
hemstetters
back
to
his
native
shores
keogh
slipped
into
the
sinecure
of
the
american
consulship
with
the
ease
that
never
left
him
even
in
such
high
places
the
tintype
establishment
was
soon
to
become
a
thing
of
the
past
although
its
deadly
work
along
the
peaceful
and
helpless
spanish
main
was
never
effaced
the
restless
partners
were
about
to
be
off
again
scouting
ahead
of
the
slow
ranks
of
fortune
but
now
they
would
take
different
ways
there
were
rumours
of
a
promising
uprising
in
peru
and
thither
the
martial
clancy
would
turn
his
adventurous
steps
as
for
keogh
he
was
figuring
in
his
mind
and
on
quires
of
government
a
scheme
that
dwarfed
the
art
of
misrepresenting
the
human
countenance
upon
tin
what
suits
me
keogh
used
to
say
in
the
way
of
a
business
proposition
is
something
diversified
that
looks
like
a
longer
shot
than
it
is
something
in
the
way
of
a
genteel
graft
that
is
worked
enough
for
the
correspondence
schools
to
be
teaching
it
by
mail
i
take
the
long
end
but
i
like
to
have
at
least
as
good
a
chance
to
win
as
a
man
learning
to
play
poker
on
an
ocean
steamer
or
running
for
governor
of
texas
on
the
republican
ticket
and
when
i
cash
in
my
winnings
i
do
want
to
find
any
widows
and
orphans
chips
in
my
stack
the
globe
was
the
green
table
on
which
keogh
gambled
the
games
he
played
were
of
his
own
invention
he
was
no
grubber
after
the
diffident
dollar
nor
did
he
care
to
follow
it
with
horn
and
hounds
rather
he
loved
to
coax
it
with
egregious
and
brilliant
flies
from
its
habitat
in
the
waters
of
strange
streams
yet
keogh
was
a
business
man
and
his
schemes
in
spite
of
their
singularity
were
as
solidly
set
as
the
plans
of
a
building
contractor
in
arthur
time
sir
william
keogh
would
have
been
a
knight
of
the
round
table
in
these
modern
days
he
rides
abroad
seeking
the
graft
instead
of
the
grail
three
days
after
johnny
departure
two
small
schooners
appeared
off
coralio
after
some
delay
a
boat
put
off
from
one
of
them
and
brought
a
sunburned
young
man
ashore
this
young
man
had
a
shrewd
and
calculating
eye
and
he
gazed
with
amazement
at
the
strange
things
that
he
saw
he
found
on
the
beach
some
one
who
directed
him
to
the
consul
office
and
thither
he
made
his
way
at
a
nervous
gait
keogh
was
sprawled
in
the
official
chair
drawing
caricatures
of
his
uncle
head
on
an
official
pad
of
paper
he
looked
up
at
his
visitor
where
johnny
atwood
inquired
the
sunburned
young
man
in
a
business
tone
gone
said
keogh
working
carefully
at
uncle
sam
necktie
that
just
like
him
remarked
the
one
leaning
against
the
table
he
always
was
a
fellow
to
gallivant
around
instead
of
to
business
will
he
be
in
soon
do
think
so
said
keogh
after
a
fair
amount
of
deliberation
i
he
out
at
some
of
his
tomfoolery
conjectured
the
visitor
in
a
tone
of
virtuous
conviction
johnny
never
would
stick
to
anything
long
enough
to
succeed
i
wonder
how
he
manages
to
run
his
business
here
and
never
be
to
look
after
it
i
looking
after
the
business
just
now
admitted
the
consul
are
you
then
say
where
the
factory
what
factory
asked
keogh
with
a
mildly
polite
interest
why
the
factory
where
they
use
them
cockleburrs
lord
knows
what
they
use
for
anyway
i
got
the
basements
of
both
them
ships
out
there
loaded
with
i
give
you
a
bargain
in
this
lot
had
every
man
woman
and
child
around
dalesburg
that
was
busy
pickin
for
a
month
i
hired
these
ships
to
bring
over
everybody
thought
i
was
crazy
now
you
can
have
this
lot
for
fifteen
cents
a
pound
delivered
on
land
and
if
you
want
more
i
guess
old
alabam
can
come
up
to
the
demand
johnny
told
me
when
he
left
home
that
if
he
struck
anything
down
here
that
there
was
any
money
in
let
me
in
on
it
shall
i
drive
the
ships
in
and
hitch
a
look
of
supreme
almost
incredulous
delight
dawned
in
ruddy
countenance
he
dropped
his
pencil
his
eyes
turned
upon
the
sunburned
young
man
with
joy
in
them
mingled
with
fear
lest
his
ecstasy
should
prove
a
dream
for
god
sake
tell
me
said
keogh
earnestly
are
you
dink
pawson
my
name
is
pinkney
dawson
said
the
cornerer
of
the
cockleburr
market
billy
keogh
slid
rapturously
and
gently
from
his
chair
to
his
favourite
strip
of
matting
on
the
floor
there
were
not
many
sounds
in
coralio
on
that
sultry
afternoon
among
those
that
were
may
be
mentioned
a
noise
of
enraptured
and
unrighteous
laughter
from
a
prostrate
while
a
sunburned
young
man
with
a
shrewd
eye
looked
on
him
with
wonder
and
amazement
also
the
tramp
tramp
tramp
of
many
feet
in
the
streets
outside
also
the
lonesome
wash
of
the
waves
that
beat
along
the
historic
shores
of
the
spanish
main
xiv
masters
of
arts
a
stub
of
a
blue
pencil
was
the
wand
with
which
keogh
performed
the
preliminary
acts
of
his
magic
so
with
this
he
covered
paper
with
diagrams
and
figures
while
he
waited
for
the
united
states
of
america
to
send
down
to
coralio
a
successor
to
atwood
resigned
the
new
scheme
that
his
mind
had
conceived
his
stout
heart
indorsed
and
his
blue
pencil
corroborated
was
laid
around
the
characteristics
and
human
frailties
of
the
new
president
of
anchuria
these
characteristics
and
the
situation
out
of
which
keogh
hoped
to
wrest
a
golden
tribute
deserve
chronicling
contributive
to
the
clear
order
of
events
president
losada
many
called
him
dictator
was
a
man
whose
genius
would
have
made
him
conspicuous
even
among
had
not
that
genius
been
intermixed
with
other
traits
that
were
petty
and
subversive
he
had
some
of
the
lofty
patriotism
of
washington
the
man
he
most
admired
the
force
of
napoleon
and
much
of
the
wisdom
of
the
sages
these
characteristics
might
have
justified
him
in
the
assumption
of
the
title
of
the
illustrious
liberator
had
they
not
been
accompanied
by
a
stupendous
and
amazing
vanity
that
kept
him
in
the
less
worthy
ranks
of
the
dictators
yet
he
did
his
country
great
service
with
a
mighty
grasp
he
shook
it
nearly
free
from
the
shackles
of
ignorance
and
sloth
and
the
vermin
that
fed
upon
it
and
all
but
made
it
a
power
in
the
council
of
nations
he
established
schools
and
hospitals
built
roads
bridges
railroads
and
palaces
and
bestowed
generous
subsidies
upon
the
arts
and
sciences
he
was
the
absolute
despot
and
the
idol
of
his
people
the
wealth
of
the
country
poured
into
his
hands
other
presidents
had
been
rapacious
without
reason
losada
amassed
enormous
wealth
but
his
people
had
their
share
of
the
benefits
the
joint
in
his
armour
was
his
insatiate
passion
for
monuments
and
tokens
commemorating
his
glory
in
every
town
he
caused
to
be
erected
statues
of
himself
bearing
legends
in
praise
of
his
greatness
in
the
walls
of
every
public
edifice
tablets
were
fixed
reciting
his
splendour
and
the
gratitude
of
his
subjects
his
statuettes
and
portraits
were
scattered
throughout
the
land
in
every
house
and
hut
one
of
the
sycophants
in
his
court
painted
him
as
john
with
a
halo
and
a
train
of
attendants
in
full
uniform
losada
saw
nothing
incongruous
in
this
picture
and
had
it
hung
in
a
church
in
the
capital
he
ordered
from
a
french
sculptor
a
marble
group
including
himself
with
napoleon
alexander
the
great
and
one
or
two
others
whom
he
deemed
worthy
of
the
honour
he
ransacked
europe
for
decorations
employing
policy
money
and
intrigue
to
cajole
the
orders
he
coveted
from
kings
and
rulers
on
state
occasions
his
breast
was
covered
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
crosses
stars
golden
roses
medals
and
ribbons
it
was
said
that
the
man
who
could
contrive
for
him
a
new
decoration
or
invent
some
new
method
of
extolling
his
greatness
might
plunge
a
hand
deep
into
the
treasury
this
was
the
man
upon
whom
billy
keogh
had
his
eye
the
gentle
buccaneer
had
observed
the
rain
of
favors
that
fell
upon
those
who
ministered
to
the
president
vanities
and
he
did
not
deem
it
his
duty
to
hoist
his
umbrella
against
the
scattering
drops
of
liquid
fortune
in
a
few
weeks
the
new
consul
arrived
releasing
keogh
from
his
temporary
duties
he
was
a
young
man
fresh
from
college
who
lived
for
botany
alone
the
consulate
at
coralio
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
study
tropical
flora
he
wore
smoked
glasses
and
carried
a
green
umbrella
he
filled
the
cool
back
porch
of
the
consulate
with
plants
and
specimens
so
that
space
for
a
bottle
and
chair
was
not
to
be
found
keogh
gazed
on
him
sadly
but
without
rancour
and
began
to
pack
his
gripsack
for
his
new
plot
against
stagnation
along
the
spanish
main
required
of
him
a
voyage
overseas
soon
came
the
again
she
of
the
trampish
habits
gleaning
a
cargo
of
cocoanuts
for
a
speculative
descent
upon
the
new
york
market
keogh
was
booked
for
a
passage
on
the
return
trip
yes
i
going
to
new
york
he
explained
to
the
group
of
his
countrymen
that
had
gathered
on
the
beach
to
see
him
off
but
be
back
before
you
miss
me
i
undertaken
the
art
education
of
this
piebald
country
and
i
not
the
man
to
desert
it
while
it
in
the
early
throes
of
tintypes
with
this
mysterious
declaration
of
his
intentions
keogh
boarded
the
ten
days
later
shivering
with
the
collar
of
his
thin
coat
turned
high
he
burst
into
the
studio
of
carolus
white
at
the
top
of
a
tall
building
in
tenth
street
new
york
city
carolus
white
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
frying
sausages
over
an
oil
stove
he
was
only
and
had
noble
theories
about
art
billy
keogh
exclaimed
white
extending
the
hand
that
was
not
busy
with
the
frying
pan
from
what
part
of
the
uncivilized
world
i
wonder
hello
carry
said
keogh
dragging
forward
a
stool
and
holding
his
fingers
close
to
the
stove
i
glad
i
found
you
so
soon
i
been
looking
for
you
all
day
in
the
directories
and
art
galleries
the
man
on
the
corner
told
me
where
you
were
quick
i
was
sure
you
be
painting
pictures
yet
keogh
glanced
about
the
studio
with
the
shrewd
eye
of
a
connoisseur
in
business
yes
you
can
do
it
he
declared
with
many
gentle
nods
of
his
head
that
big
one
in
the
corner
with
the
angels
and
green
clouds
and
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
we
want
what
would
you
call
that
carry
scene
from
coney
island
ai
it
that
said
white
i
had
intended
to
call
translation
of
elijah
but
you
may
be
nearer
right
than
i
am
name
does
matter
said
keogh
largely
it
the
frame
and
the
varieties
of
paint
that
does
the
trick
now
i
can
tell
you
in
a
minute
what
i
want
i
come
on
a
little
voyage
of
two
thousand
miles
to
take
you
in
with
me
on
a
scheme
i
thought
of
you
as
soon
as
the
scheme
showed
itself
to
me
how
would
you
like
to
go
back
with
me
and
paint
a
picture
ninety
days
for
the
trip
and
five
thousand
dollars
for
the
job
cereal
food
or
posters
asked
white
it
is
an
ad
what
kind
of
a
picture
is
it
to
be
it
a
long
story
said
keogh
go
ahead
with
it
if
you
do
mind
while
you
talk
i
just
keep
my
eye
on
these
sausages
let
get
one
shade
deeper
than
a
vandyke
brown
and
you
spoil
keogh
explained
his
project
they
were
to
return
to
coralio
where
white
was
to
pose
as
a
distinguished
american
portrait
painter
who
was
touring
in
the
tropics
as
a
relaxation
from
his
arduous
and
remunerative
professional
labours
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
hope
even
to
those
who
had
trod
in
the
beaten
paths
of
business
that
an
artist
with
so
much
prestige
might
secure
a
commission
to
perpetuate
upon
canvas
the
lineaments
of
the
president
and
secure
a
share
of
the
that
were
raining
upon
the
caterers
to
his
weaknesses
keogh
had
set
his
price
at
ten
thousand
dollars
artists
had
been
paid
more
for
portraits
he
and
white
were
to
share
the
expenses
of
the
trip
and
divide
the
possible
profits
thus
he
laid
the
scheme
before
white
whom
he
had
known
in
the
west
before
one
declared
for
art
and
the
other
became
a
bedouin
before
long
the
two
machinators
abandoned
the
rigour
of
the
bare
studio
for
a
snug
corner
of
a
café
there
they
sat
far
into
the
night
with
old
envelopes
and
keogh
stub
of
blue
pencil
between
them
at
twelve
white
doubled
up
in
his
chair
with
his
chin
on
his
fist
and
shut
his
eyes
at
the
unbeautiful
i
go
you
billy
he
said
in
the
quiet
tones
of
decision
got
two
or
three
hundred
saved
up
for
sausages
and
rent
and
take
the
chance
with
you
five
thousand
it
will
give
me
two
years
in
paris
and
one
in
italy
i
begin
to
pack
you
begin
in
ten
minutes
said
keogh
it
now
the
starts
back
at
four
come
on
to
your
painting
shop
and
i
help
you
for
five
months
in
the
year
coralio
is
the
newport
of
anchuria
then
only
does
the
town
possess
life
from
november
to
march
it
is
practically
the
seat
of
government
the
president
with
his
official
family
sojourns
there
and
society
follows
him
the
people
make
the
season
one
long
holiday
of
amusement
and
rejoicing
balls
games
sea
bathing
processions
and
small
theatres
contribute
to
their
enjoyment
the
famous
swiss
band
from
the
capital
plays
in
the
little
plaza
every
evening
while
the
fourteen
carriages
and
vehicles
in
the
town
circle
in
funereal
but
complacent
procession
indians
from
the
interior
mountains
looking
like
prehistoric
stone
idols
come
down
to
peddle
their
handiwork
in
the
streets
the
people
throng
the
narrow
ways
a
chattering
happy
careless
stream
of
buoyant
humanity
preposterous
children
rigged
out
with
the
shortest
of
ballet
skirts
and
gilt
wings
howl
underfoot
among
the
effervescent
crowds
especially
is
the
arrival
of
the
presidential
party
at
the
opening
of
the
season
attended
with
pomp
show
and
patriotic
demonstrations
of
enthusiasm
and
delight
when
keogh
and
white
reached
their
destination
on
the
return
trip
of
the
the
gay
winter
season
was
well
begun
as
they
stepped
upon
the
beach
they
could
hear
the
band
playing
in
the
plaza
the
village
maidens
with
fireflies
already
fixed
in
their
dark
locks
were
gliding
barefoot
and
along
the
paths
dandies
in
white
linen
swinging
their
canes
were
beginning
their
seductive
strolls
the
air
was
full
of
human
essence
of
artificial
enticement
of
coquetry
indolence
pleasure
the
sense
of
existence
the
first
two
or
three
days
after
their
arrival
were
spent
in
preliminaries
keogh
escorted
the
artist
about
town
introducing
him
to
the
little
circle
of
residents
and
pulling
whatever
wires
he
could
to
effect
the
spreading
of
white
fame
as
a
painter
and
then
keogh
planned
a
more
spectacular
demonstration
of
the
idea
he
wished
to
keep
before
the
public
he
and
white
engaged
rooms
in
the
hotel

hats

the

uniformed
officers
of

were
as

for

of
demeanour
as
keogh
and
his
friend
the
great
american
painter
señor
white
white
set
up
his
easel
on
the
beach
and
made
striking
sketches
of
the
mountain
and
sea
views
the
native
population
formed
at
his
rear
in
a
vast
chattering
semicircle
to
watch
his
work
keogh
with
his
care
for
details
had
arranged
for
himself
a
pose
which
he
carried
out
with
fidelity
his
rôle
was
that
of
friend
to
the
great
artist
a
man
of
affairs
and
leisure
the
visible
emblem
of
his
position
was
a
pocket
camera
for
branding

man
who
owns

said
he
a
genteel
dilettante
with
a
bank
account
and
an
easy
conscience
a

in
it
with
a
camera
you
see
a
man
doing
nothing
but
loafing
around
making
and
you
know
right
away
he
reads
up
well
in
you
notice
these
old
millionaire
boys
soon
as
they
get
through
taking
everything
else
in
sight
they
go
to
taking
photographs

are
more

keogh
strolled
blandly
about
coralio
snapping
the
scenery
and
the
shrinking
señoritas
while
white
posed
conspicuously
in
the
higher
regions
of
art
two
weeks
after
their
arrival
the
scheme
began
to
bear
fruit
an
of
the
president
drove
to
the
hotel
in
a
dashing
victoria
the
president
desired
that
señor
white
come
to
the
casa
morena
for
an
informal
interview
keogh
gripped
his
pipe
tightly
between
his
teeth
not
a
cent
less
than
ten
thousand
he
said
to
the
artist
remember
the
price
and
in
gold
or
its
equivalent
do
let
him
stick
you
with
this
stuff
they
call
money
here
perhaps
it
is
that
he
wants
said
white
get
out
said
keogh
with
splendid
confidence
i
know
what
he
wants
he
wants
his
picture
painted
by
the
celebrated
young
american
painter
and
filibuster
now
sojourning
in
his
country
off
you
go
the
victoria
sped
away
with
the
artist
keogh
walked
up
and
down
puffing
great
clouds
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
and
waited
in
an
hour
the
victoria
swept
again
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
deposited
white
and
vanished
the
artist
dashed
up
the
stairs
three
at
a
step
keogh
stopped
smoking
and
became
a
silent
interrogation
point
landed
exclaimed
white
with
his
boyish
face
flushed
with
elation
billy
you
are
a
wonder
he
wants
a
picture
i
tell
you
all
about
it
by
heavens
that
dictator
chap
is
a
corker
he
a
dictator
clear
down
to
his
he
a
kind
of
combination
of
julius
cæsar
lucifer
and
chauncey
depew
done
in
sepia
polite
and
grim
that
his
way
the
room
i
saw
him
in
was
about
ten
acres
big
and
looked
like
a
mississippi
steamboat
with
its
gilding
and
mirrors
and
white
paint
he
talks
english
better
than
i
can
ever
hope
to
the
matter
of
the
price
came
up
i
mentioned
ten
thousand
i
expected
him
to
call
the
guard
and
have
me
taken
out
and
shot
he
did
move
an
eyelash
he
just
waved
one
of
his
chestnut
hands
in
a
careless
way
and
said
you
say
i
am
to
go
back
and
discuss
with
him
the
details
of
the
picture
keogh
hung
his
head
was
easy
to
read
in
his
downcast
countenance
i
failing
carry
he
said
sorrowfully
i
not
fit
to
handle
these
schemes
any
longer
peddling
oranges
in
a
is
about
the
suitable
graft
for
me
when
i
said
ten
thousand
i
swear
i
thought
i
had
sized
up
that
brown
man
limit
to
within
two
cents
he
have
melted
down
for
fifteen
thousand
just
as
easy
say
carry
you
see
old
man
keogh
safe
in
some
nice
quiet
idiot
asylum
wo
you
if
he
makes
a
break
like
that
again
the
casa
morena
although
only
one
story
in
height
was
a
building
of
brown
stone
luxurious
as
a
palace
in
its
interior
it
stood
on
a
low
hill
in
a
walled
garden
of
splendid
tropical
flora
at
the
upper
edge
of
coralio
the
next
day
the
president
carriage
came
again
for
the
artist
keogh
went
out
for
a
walk
along
the
beach
where
he
and
his
picture
box
were
now
familiar
sights
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
white
was
sitting
in
a
on
the
balcony
well
said
keogh
did
you
and
his
nibs
decide
on
the
kind
of
a
chromo
he
wants
white
got
up
and
walked
back
and
forth
on
the
balcony
a
few
times
then
he
stopped
and
laughed
strangely
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
were
bright
with
a
kind
of
angry
amusement
look
here
billy
he
said
somewhat
roughly
when
you
first
came
to
me
in
my
studio
and
mentioned
a
picture
i
thought
you
wanted
a
smashed
oats
or
a
hair
tonic
poster
painted
on
a
range
of
mountains
or
the
side
of
a
continent
well
either
of
those
jobs
would
have
been
art
in
its
highest
form
compared
to
the
one
you
steered
me
against
i
ca
paint
that
picture
billy
you
got
to
let
me
out
let
me
try
to
tell
you
what
that
barbarian
wants
he
had
it
all
planned
out
and
even
a
sketch
made
of
his
idea
the
old
boy
does
draw
badly
at
all
but
ye
goddesses
of
art
listen
to
the
monstrosity
he
expects
me
to
paint
he
wants
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
canvas
of
course
he
is
to
be
painted
as
jupiter
sitting
on
olympus
with
the
clouds
at
his
feet
at
one
side
of
him
stands
george
washington
in
full
regimentals
with
his
hand
on
the
president
shoulder
an
angel
with
outstretched
wings
hovers
overhead
and
is
placing
a
laurel
wreath
on
the
president
head
crowning
him
queen
of
the
may
i
suppose
in
the
background
is
to
be
cannon
more
angels
and
soldiers
the
man
who
would
paint
that
picture
would
have
to
have
the
soul
of
a
dog
and
would
deserve
to
go
down
into
oblivion
without
even
a
tin
can
tied
to
his
tail
to
sound
his
memory
little
beads
of
moisture
crept
out
all
over
billy
keogh
brow
the
stub
of
his
blue
pencil
had
not
figured
out
a
contingency
like
this
the
machinery
of
his
plan
had
run
with
flattering
smoothness
until
now
he
dragged
another
chair
upon
the
balcony
and
got
white
back
to
his
seat
he
lit
his
pipe
with
apparent
calm
now
sonny
he
said
with
gentle
grimness
you
and
me
will
have
an
art
to
art
talk
you
got
your
art
and
i
got
mine
yours
is
the
real
pierian
stuff
that
turns
up
its
nose
at
signs
and
oleographs
of
the
old
mill
mine
the
art
of
business
this
was
my
scheme
and
it
worked
out
like
paint
that
president
man
as
old
king
cole
or
venus
or
a
landscape
or
a
fresco
or
a
bunch
of
lilies
or
anything
he
thinks
he
looks
like
but
get
the
paint
on
the
canvas
and
collect
the
spoils
you
would
throw
me
down
carry
at
this
stage
of
the
game
think
of
that
ten
thousand
i
ca
help
thinking
of
it
said
white
and
that
what
hurts
i
tempted
to
throw
every
ideal
i
ever
had
down
in
the
mire
and
steep
my
soul
in
infamy
by
painting
that
picture
that
five
thousand
meant
three
years
of
foreign
study
to
me
and
i
almost
sell
my
soul
for
that
now
it
ai
as
bad
as
that
said
keogh
soothingly
it
a
business
proposition
it
so
much
paint
and
time
against
money
i
do
fall
in
with
your
idea
that
that
picture
would
so
everlastingly
jolt
the
art
side
of
the
question
george
washington
was
all
right
you
know
and
nobody
could
say
a
word
against
the
angel
i
think
so
bad
of
that
group
if
you
was
to
give
jupiter
a
pair
of
epaulets
and
a
sword
and
kind
of
work
the
clouds
around
to
look
like
a
blackberry
patch
it
would
make
such
a
bad
battle
scene
why
if
we
had
already
settled
on
the
price
he
ought
to
pay
an
extra
thousand
for
washington
and
the
angel
ought
to
raise
it
five
hundred
you
do
understand
billy
said
white
with
an
uneasy
laugh
some
of
us
fellows
who
try
to
paint
have
big
notions
about
art
i
wanted
to
paint
a
picture
some
day
that
people
would
stand
before
and
forget
that
it
was
made
of
paint
i
wanted
it
to
creep
into
them
like
a
bar
of
music
and
mushroom
there
like
a
soft
bullet
and
i
wanted
to
go
away
and
ask
else
has
he
done
and
i
did
want
to
find
a
thing
not
a
portrait
nor
a
magazine
cover
nor
an
illustration
nor
a
drawing
of
a
girl
nothing
but
picture
that
why
i
lived
on
fried
sausages
and
tried
to
keep
true
to
myself
i
persuaded
myself
to
do
this
portrait
for
the
chance
it
might
give
me
to
study
abroad
but
this
howling
screaming
caricature
good
lord
ca
you
see
how
it
is
sure
said
keogh
as
tenderly
as
he
would
have
spoken
to
a
child
and
he
laid
a
long
forefinger
on
white
knee
i
see
it
bad
to
have
your
art
all
slugged
up
like
that
i
know
you
wanted
to
paint
a
big
thing
like
the
panorama
of
the
battle
of
gettysburg
but
let
me
kalsomine
you
a
little
mental
sketch
to
consider
up
to
date
out
on
this
scheme
our
capital
took
every
cent
both
of
us
could
raise
we
got
about
enough
left
to
get
back
to
new
york
on
i
need
my
share
of
that
ten
thousand
i
want
to
work
a
copper
deal
in
idaho
and
make
a
hundred
thousand
that
the
business
end
of
the
thing
come
down
off
your
art
perch
carry
and
let
land
that
hatful
of
dollars
billy
said
white
with
an
effort
i
try
i
wo
say
i
do
it
but
i
try
i
go
at
it
and
put
it
through
if
i
can
that
business
said
keogh
heartily
good
boy
now
another
thing
rush
that
picture
crowd
it
through
as
quick
as
you
can
get
a
couple
of
boys
to
help
you
mix
the
paint
if
necessary
i
picked
up
some
pointers
around
town
the
people
here
are
beginning
to
get
sick
of
president
they
say
he
been
too
free
with
concessions
and
they
accuse
him
of
trying
to
make
a
dicker
with
england
to
sell
out
the
country
we
want
that
picture
done
and
paid
for
before
there
any
row
in
the
great
of
casa
morena
the
president
caused
to
be
stretched
a
huge
canvas
under
this
white
set
up
his
temporary
studio
for
two
hours
each
day
the
great
man
sat
to
him
white
worked
faithfully
but
as
the
work
progressed
he
had
seasons
of
bitter
scorn
of
infinite
of
sullen
gloom
and
sardonic
gaiety
keogh
with
the
patience
of
a
great
general
soothed
coaxed
argued
kept
him
at
the
picture
at
the
end
of
a
month
white
announced
that
the
picture
was
completed
jupiter
washington
angels
clouds
cannon
and
all
his
face
was
pale
and
his
mouth
drawn
straight
when
he
told
keogh
he
said
the
president
was
much
pleased
with
it
it
was
to
be
hung
in
the
national
gallery
of
statesmen
and
heroes
the
artist
had
been
requested
to
return
to
casa
morena
on
the
following
day
to
receive
payment
at
the
appointed
time
he
left
the
hotel
silent
under
his
friend
joyful
talk
of
their
success
an
hour
later
he
walked
into
the
room
where
keogh
was
waiting
threw
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
sat
upon
the
table
billy
he
said
in
strained
and
labouring
tones
i
a
little
money
out
west
in
a
small
business
that
my
brother
is
running
what
i
been
living
on
while
i
been
studying
art
i
draw
out
my
share
and
pay
you
back
what
you
lost
on
this
scheme
lost
exclaimed
keogh
jumping
up
did
you
get
paid
for
the
picture
yes
i
got
paid
said
white
but
just
now
there
is
any
picture
and
there
is
any
pay
if
you
care
to
hear
about
it
here
are
the
edifying
details
the
president
and
i
were
looking
at
the
painting
his
secretary
brought
a
bank
draft
on
new
york
for
ten
thousand
dollars
and
handed
it
to
me
the
moment
i
touched
it
i
went
wild
i
tore
it
into
little
pieces
and
threw
them
on
the
floor
a
workman
was
repainting
the
pillars
inside
the
a
bucket
of
his
paint
happened
to
be
convenient
i
picked
up
his
brush
and
slapped
a
quart
of
blue
paint
all
over
that
nightmare
i
bowed
and
walked
out
the
president
did
move
or
speak
that
was
one
time
he
was
taken
by
surprise
it
tough
on
you
billy
but
i
help
it
there
seemed
to
be
excitement
in
coralio
outside
there
was
a
confused
rising
murmur
pierced
by
cries
el
traidor
muerte
el
traidor
were
the
words
they
seemed
to
form
listen
to
that
exclaimed
white
bitterly
i
know
that
much
spanish
they
shouting
with
the
traitor
i
heard
them
before
i
felt
that
they
meant
me
i
was
a
traitor
to
art
the
picture
had
to
go
with
the
blank
fool
would
have
suited
your
case
better
said
keogh
with
fiery
emphasis
you
tear
up
ten
thousand
dollars
like
an
old
rag
because
the
way
you
spread
on
five
dollars
worth
of
paint
hurts
your
conscience
next
time
i
pick
a
in
a
scheme
the
man
has
got
to
go
before
a
notary
and
swear
he
never
even
heard
the
word
mentioned
keogh
strode
from
the
room
white
paid
little
attention
to
his
resentment
the
scorn
of
billy
keogh
seemed
a
trifling
thing
beside
the
greater
he
had
escaped
in
coralio
the
excitement
waxed
an
outburst
was
imminent
the
cause
of
this
demonstration
of
displeasure
was
the
presence
in
the
town
of
a
big
englishman
who
it
was
said
was
an
agent
of
his
government
come
to
clinch
the
bargain
by
which
the
president
placed
his
people
in
the
hands
of
a
foreign
power
it
was
charged
that
not
only
had
he
given
away
priceless
concessions
but
that
the
public
debt
was
to
be
transferred
into
the
hands
of
the
english
and
the
turned
over
to
them
as
a
guarantee
the
people
had
determined
to
make
their
protest
felt
on
that
night
in
coralio
and
in
other
towns
their
ire
found
vent
yelling
mobs
mercurial
but
dangerous
roamed
the
streets
they
overthrew
the
great
bronze
statue
of
the
president
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
plaza
and
hacked
it
to
shapeless
pieces
they
tore
from
public
buildings
the
tablets
set
there
proclaiming
the
glory
of
the
illustrious
liberator
his
pictures
in
the
government
offices
were
demolished
the
mobs
even
attacked
the
casa
morena
but
were
driven
away
by
the
military
which
remained
faithful
to
the
executive
all
the
night
terror
reigned
the
greatness
of
losada
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
by
noon
the
next
day
order
was
restored
and
he
was
still
absolute
he
issued
proclamations
denying
positively
that
any
negotiations
of
any
kind
had
been
entered
into
with
england
sir
stafford
vaughn
the
englishman
also
declared
in
placards
and
in
public
print
that
his
presence
there
had
no
international
significance
he
was
a
traveller
without
guile
in
fact
so
he
stated
he
had
not
even
spoken
with
the
president
or
been
in
his
presence
since
his
arrival
during
this
disturbance
white
was
preparing
for
his
homeward
voyage
in
the
steamship
that
was
to
sail
within
two
or
three
days
about
noon
keogh
the
restless
took
his
camera
out
with
the
hope
of
speeding
the
lagging
hours
the
town
was
now
as
quiet
as
if
peace
had
never
departed
from
her
perch
on
the
roofs
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
keogh
hurried
back
to
the
hotel
with
something
decidedly
special
in
his
air
he
retired
to
the
little
room
where
he
developed
his
pictures
later
on
he
came
out
to
white
on
the
balcony
with
a
luminous
grim
predatory
smile
on
his
face
do
you
know
what
that
is
he
asked
holding
up
a
photograph
mounted
on
cardboard
of
a
señorita
sitting
in
the
sand
alliteration
unintentional
guessed
white
lazily
wrong
said
keogh
with
shining
eyes
it
a
it
a
can
of
dynamite
it
a
gold
mine
it
a
on
your
president
man
for
twenty
thousand
dollars
yes
sir
twenty
thousand
this
time
and
no
spoiling
the
picture
no
ethics
of
art
in
the
way
art
you
with
your
smelly
little
tubes
i
got
you
skinned
to
death
with
a
kodak
take
a
look
at
that
white
took
the
picture
in
his
hand
and
gave
a
long
whistle
jove
he
exclaimed
but
would
that
stir
up
a
row
in
town
if
you
let
it
be
seen
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
it
billy
you
know
that
high
wall
around
the
president
man
back
garden
i
was
up
there
trying
to
get
a
of
the
town
i
happened
to
notice
a
chink
in
the
wall
where
a
stone
and
a
lot
of
plaster
had
slid
out
thinks
i
i
take
a
peep
through
to
see
how
president
cabbages
are
growing
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
him
and
this
sir
englishman
sitting
at
a
little
table
about
twenty
feet
away
they
had
the
table
all
spread
over
with
documents
and
they
were
hobnobbing
over
them
as
thick
as
two
pirates
was
a
nice
corner
of
the
garden
all
private
and
shady
with
palms
and
orange
trees
and
they
had
a
pail
of
champagne
set
by
handy
in
the
grass
i
knew
then
was
the
time
for
me
to
make
my
big
hit
in
art
so
i
raised
the
machine
up
to
the
crack
and
pressed
the
button
just
as
i
did
so
them
old
boys
shook
hands
on
the
deal
you
see
they
took
that
way
in
the
picture
keogh
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
white
me
said
keogh
in
a
hurt
tone
why
i
going
to
tie
a
pink
ribbon
to
it
and
hang
it
on
the
of
course
i
surprised
at
you
but
while
i
out
you
just
try
to
figure
out
what
potentate
would
be
most
likely
to
want
to
buy
this
work
of
art
for
his
private
collection
just
to
keep
it
out
of
circulation
the
sunset
was
reddening
the
tops
of
the
cocoanut
palms
when
billy
keogh
came
back
from
casa
morena
he
nodded
to
the
questioning
gaze
and
lay
down
on
a
cot
with
his
hands
under
the
back
of
his
head
i
saw
him
he
paid
the
money
like
a
little
man
they
did
want
to
let
me
in
at
first
i
told
it
was
important
yes
that
president
man
is
on
the
list
he
got
a
beautiful
business
system
about
the
way
he
uses
his
brains
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
hold
up
the
photograph
so
he
could
see
it
and
name
the
price
he
just
smiled
and
walked
over
to
a
safe
and
got
the
cash
twenty
united
states
treasury
notes
he
laid
on
the
table
like
i
pay
out
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
fine
notes
too
they
crackled
with
a
sound
like
burning
the
brush
off
a
lot
let
try
the
feel
of
one
said
white
curiously
i
never
saw
a
bill
keogh
did
not
immediately
respond
carry
he
said
in
an
way
you
think
a
heap
of
your
art
do
you
more
said
white
frankly
than
has
been
for
the
financial
good
of
myself
and
my
friends
i
thought
you
were
a
fool
the
other
day
went
on
keogh
quietly
and
i
not
sure
now
that
you
was
but
if
you
was
so
am
been
in
some
funny
deals
carry
but
i
always
managed
to
scramble
fair
and
match
my
brains
and
capital
against
the
other
fellow
but
when
it
comes
to
well
when
you
got
the
other
fellow
cinched
and
the
screws
on
him
and
he
got
to
put
up
why
it
do
strike
me
as
being
a
man
game
they
got
a
name
for
it
you
know
it
confound
you
do
you
understand
a
fellow
feels
something
like
that
blamed
art
of
yours
he
well
i
tore
that
photograph
up
and
laid
the
pieces
on
that
stack
of
money
and
shoved
the
whole
business
back
across
the
table
me
losada
i
said
i
guess
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
price
you
get
the
photo
for
nothing
now
carry
you
get
out
the
pencil
and
we
do
some
more
figuring
i
like
to
save
enough
out
of
our
capital
for
you
to
have
some
fried
sausages
in
your
joint
when
you
get
back
to
new
york
xv
dicky
there
is
little
consecutiveness
along
the
spanish
main
things
happen
there
intermittently
even
time
seems
to
hang
his
scythe
daily
on
the
branch
of
an
orange
tree
while
he
takes
a
siesta
and
a
cigarette
after
the
ineffectual
revolt
against
the
administration
of
president
losada
the
country
settled
again
into
quiet
toleration
of
the
abuses
with
which
he
had
been
charged
in
coralio
old
political
enemies
went
lightly
eschewing
for
the
time
all
differences
of
opinion
the
failure
of
the
art
expedition
did
not
stretch
the
keogh
upon
his
back
the
ups
and
downs
of
fortune
made
smooth
travelling
for
his
nimble
steps
his
blue
pencil
stub
was
at
work
again
before
the
smoke
of
the
steamer
on
which
white
sailed
had
cleared
away
from
the
horizon
he
had
but
to
speak
a
word
to
geddie
to
find
his
credit
negotiable
for
whatever
goods
he
wanted
from
the
store
of
brannigan
company
on
the
same
day
on
which
white
arrived
in
new
york
keogh
at
the
rear
of
a
train
of
five
pack
mules
loaded
with
hardware
and
cutlery
set
his
face
toward
the
grim
interior
mountains
there
the
indian
tribes
wash
gold
dust
from
the
auriferous
streams
and
when
a
market
is
brought
to
them
trading
is
brisk
and
in
the
cordilleras
in
coralio
time
folded
his
wings
and
paced
wearily
along
his
drowsy
path
they
who
had
most
cheered
the
torpid
hours
were
gone
clancy
had
sailed
on
a
spanish
barque
for
colon
contemplating
a
cut
across
the
isthmus
and
then
a
further
voyage
to
end
at
calao
where
the
fighting
was
said
to
be
on
geddie
whose
quiet
and
genial
nature
had
once
served
to
mitigate
the
frequent
dull
reaction
of
lotus
eating
was
now
a
happy
with
his
bright
orchid
paula
and
never
even
dreaming
of
or
regretting
the
unsolved
sealed
and
monogramed
bottle
whose
contents
now
inconsiderable
were
held
safely
in
the
keeping
of
the
sea
well
may
the
walrus
most
discerning
and
eclectic
of
beasts
place
midway
on
his
programme
of
topics
that
fall
pertinent
and
diverting
upon
the
ear
atwood
was
gone
he
of
the
hospitable
back
porch
and
ingenuous
cunning
gregg
with
his
trepanning
story
smouldering
within
him
was
a
whiskered
volcano
always
showing
signs
of
imminent
eruption
and
was
not
to
be
considered
in
the
ranks
of
those
who
might
contribute
to
the
amelioration
of
ennui
the
new
consul
note
chimed
with
the
sad
sea
waves
and
the
violent
tropical
greens
he
had
not
a
bar
of
scheherezade
or
of
the
round
table
in
his
lute
goodwin
was
employed
with
large
projects
what
time
he
was
loosed
from
them
found
him
at
his
home
where
he
loved
to
be
therefore
it
will
be
seen
that
there
was
a
dearth
of
fellowship
and
entertainment
among
the
foreign
contingent
of
coralio
and
then
dicky
maloney
dropped
down
from
the
clouds
upon
the
town
and
amused
it
nobody
knew
where
dicky
maloney
hailed
from
or
how
he
reached
coralio
he
appeared
there
one
day
and
that
was
all
he
afterward
said
that
he
came
on
the
fruit
steamer
but
an
inspection
of
the
passenger
list
of
that
date
was
found
to
be
maloneyless
curiosity
however
soon
perished
and
dicky
took
his
place
among
the
odd
fish
cast
up
by
the
caribbean
he
was
an
active
rollicking
fellow
with
an
engaging
gray
eye
the
most
irresistible
grin
a
rather
dark
or
much
sunburned
complexion
and
a
head
of
the
fieriest
red
hair
ever
seen
in
that
country
speaking
the
spanish
language
as
well
as
he
spoke
english
and
seeming
always
to
have
plenty
of
silver
in
his
pockets
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
a
welcome
companion
whithersoever
he
went
he
had
an
extreme
fondness
for
and
gained
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
drink
more
of
it
than
any
three
men
in
town
everybody
called
him
dicky
everybody
cheered
up
at
the
sight
of
him
especially
the
natives
to
whom
his
marvellous
red
hair
and
his
style
were
a
constant
delight
and
envy
wherever
you
went
in
the
town
you
would
soon
see
dicky
or
hear
his
genial
laugh
and
find
around
him
a
group
of
admirers
who
appreciated
him
both
for
his
good
nature
and
the
white
wine
he
was
always
so
ready
to
buy
a
considerable
amount
of
speculation
was
had
concerning
the
object
of
his
sojourn
there
until
one
day
he
silenced
this
by
opening
a
small
shop
for
the
sale
of
tobacco
and
the
handiwork
of
the
interior
indians
goods
deerskin
and
basketwork
of
reeds
even
then
he
did
not
change
his
habits
for
he
was
drinking
and
playing
cards
half
the
day
and
night
with
the
the
collector
of
customs
the
and
other
gay
dogs
among
the
native
officials
one
day
dicky
saw
pasa
the
daughter
of
madama
ortiz
sitting
in
the
of
the
hotel
de
los
estranjeros
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
still
for
the
first
time
in
coralio
and
then
he
sped
swift
as
a
deer
to
find
vasquez
a
gilded
native
youth
to
present
him
the
young
men
had
named
pasa
santita
is
a
spanish
word
for
a
certain
colour
that
you
must
go
to
more
trouble
to
describe
in
english
by
saying
the
little
saint
tinted
the
most
you
will
approximate
the
description
of
madama
ortiz
daughter
la
madama
ortiz
sold
rum
in
addition
to
other
liquors
now
you
must
know
that
the
rum
expiates
whatever
opprobrium
attends
upon
the
other
commodities
for
mind
you
is
a
government
monopoly
and
to
keep
a
government
dispensary
assures
respectability
if
not
preëminence
moreover
the
saddest
of
precisians
could
find
no
fault
with
the
conduct
of
the
shop
customers
drank
there
in
the
lowest
of
spirits
and
fearsomely
as
in
the
shadow
of
the
dead
for
ancient
and
vaunted
lineage
counteracted
even
the
rum
behest
to
be
merry
for
was
she
not
of
the
iglesias
who
landed
with
pizarro
and
had
not
her
deceased
husband
been
de
caminos
y
for
the
district
in
the
evenings
pasa
sat
by
the
window
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
they
drank
and
strummed
dreamily
upon
her
guitar
and
then
by
twos
and
threes
would
come
visiting
young
caballeros
and
occupy
the
prim
line
of
chairs
set
against
the
wall
of
this
room
they
were
there
to
besiege
the
heart
of
their
method
which
is
not
proof
against
intelligent
competition
consisted
of
expanding
the
chest
looking
valorous
and
consuming
a
gross
or
two
of
cigarettes
even
saints
delicately
oranged
prefer
to
be
wooed
differently
doña
pasa
would
tide
over
the
vast
chasms
of
nicotinized
silence
with
music
from
her
guitar
while
she
wondered
if
the
romances
she
had
read
about
gallant
and
more
more
contiguous
cavaliers
were
all
lies
at
somewhat
regular
intervals
madama
would
glide
in
from
the
dispensary
with
a
sort
of
gleam
in
her
eye
and
there
would
be
a
rustling
of
white
trousers
as
one
of
the
caballeros
would
propose
an
adjournment
to
the
bar
that
dicky
maloney
would
sooner
or
later
explore
this
field
was
a
thing
to
be
foreseen
there
were
few
doors
in
coralio
into
which
his
red
head
had
not
been
poked
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
after
his
first
sight
of
her
he
was
there
seated
close
beside
her
rocking
chair
there
were
no
poses
in
dicky
theory
of
wooing
his
plan
of
subjection
was
an
attack
at
close
range
to
carry
the
fortress
with
one
concentrated
ardent
eloquent
irresistible
that
was
dicky
way
pasa
was
descended
from
the
proudest
spanish
families
in
the
country
moreover
she
had
had
unusual
advantages
two
years
in
a
new
orleans
school
had
elevated
her
ambitions
and
fitted
her
for
a
fate
above
the
ordinary
maidens
of
her
native
land
and
yet
here
she
succumbed
to
the
first
scamp
with
a
glib
tongue
and
a
charming
smile
that
came
along
and
courted
her
properly
very
soon
dicky
took
her
to
the
little
church
on
the
corner
of
the
plaza
and
maloney
was
added
to
her
string
of
distinguished
names
and
it
was
her
fate
to
sit
with
her
patient
saintly
eyes
and
figure
like
a
bisque
psyche
behind
the
sequestered
counter
of
the
little
shop
while
dicky
drank
and
philandered
with
his
frivolous
acquaintances
the
women
with
their
naturally
fine
instinct
saw
a
chance
for
vivisection
and
delicately
taunted
her
with
his
habits
she
turned
upon
them
in
a
beautiful
steady
blaze
of
sorrowful
contempt
you
she
said
in
her
level
tones
you
know
nothing
of
a
man
your
men
are
they
are
fit
only
to
roll
cigarettes
in
the
shade
until
the
sun
strikes
and
shrivels
them
up
they
drone
in
your
hammocks
and
you
comb
their
hair
and
feed
them
with
fresh
fruit
my
man
is
of
no
such
blood
let
him
drink
of
the
wine
when
he
has
taken
sufficient
of
it
to
drown
one
of
your
he
will
come
home
to
me
more
of
a
man
than
one
thousand
of
your
hair
he
smooths
and
braids
to
me
he
sings
he
himself
removes
my
and
there
there
upon
each
instep
leaves
a
kiss
he
holds
oh
you
will
never
understand
blind
ones
who
have
never
known
a
sometimes
mysterious
things
happened
at
night
about
dicky
shop
while
the
front
of
it
was
dark
in
the
little
room
back
of
it
dicky
and
a
few
of
his
friends
would
sit
about
a
table
carrying
on
some
kind
of
very
quiet
until
quite
late
finally
he
would
let
them
out
the
front
door
very
carefully
and
go
upstairs
to
his
little
saint
these
visitors
were
generally
men
with
dark
clothes
and
hats
of
course
these
dark
doings
were
noticed
after
a
while
and
talked
about
dicky
seemed
to
care
nothing
at
all
for
the
society
of
the
alien
residents
of
the
town
he
avoided
goodwin
and
his
skilful
escape
from
the
trepanning
story
of
gregg
is
still
referred
to
in
coralio
as
a
masterpiece
of
lightning
diplomacy
many
letters
arrived
addressed
to
dicky
maloney
or
señor
dickee
maloney
to
the
considerable
pride
of
pasa
that
so
many
people
should
desire
to
write
to
him
only
confirmed
her
own
suspicion
that
the
light
from
his
red
head
shone
around
the
world
as
to
their
contents
she
never
felt
curiosity
there
was
a
wife
for
you
the
one
mistake
dicky
made
in
coralio
was
to
run
out
of
money
at
the
wrong
time
where
his
money
came
from
was
a
puzzle
for
the
sales
of
his
shop
were
next
to
nothing
but
that
source
failed
and
at
a
peculiarly
unfortunate
time
it
was
when
the
don
señor
el
coronel
encarnacion
rios
looked
upon
the
little
saint
seated
in
the
shop
and
felt
his
heart
go
pitapat
the
who
was
versed
in
all
the
intricate
arts
of
gallantry
first
delicately
hinted
at
his
sentiments
by
donning
his
dress
uniform
and
strutting
up
and
down
fiercely
before
her
window
pasa
glancing
demurely
with
her
saintly
eyes
instantly
perceived
his
resemblance
to
her
parrot
chichi
and
was
diverted
to
the
extent
of
a
smile
the
saw
the
smile
which
was
not
intended
for
him
convinced
of
an
impression
made
he

confidently
and
advanced

open
compliment
pasa
froze
he
pranced
she
flamed
royally
he
was
charmed
to
injudicious
persistence
she
commanded
him
to
leave
the
shop
he
tried
to
capture
her
hand
and
dicky
entered
smiling
broadly
full
of
white
wine
and
the
devil
he
spent
five
minutes
in
punishing
the
scientifically
and
carefully
so
that
the
pain
might
be
prolonged
as
far
as
possible
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
pitched
the
rash
wooer
out
the
door
upon
the
stones
of
the
street
senseless
a
barefooted
policeman
who
had
been
watching
the
affair
from
across
the
street
blew
a
whistle
a
squad
of
four
soldiers
came
running
from
the
around
the
corner
when
they
saw
that
the
offender
was
dicky
they
stopped
and
blew
more
whistles
which
brought
out
reënforcements
of
eight
deeming
the
odds
against
them
sufficiently
reduced
the
military
advanced
upon
the
disturber
dicky
being
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
martial
spirit
stooped
and
drew
the
sword
which
was
girded
about
him
and
charged
his
foe
he
chased
the
standing
army
four
squares
playfully
prodding
its
squealing
rear
and
hacking
at
its
heels
but
he
was
not
so
successful
with
the
civic
authorities
six
muscular
nimble
policemen
overpowered
him
and
conveyed
him
triumphantly
but
warily
to
jail
diablo
they
dubbed
him
and
derided
the
military
for
its
defeat
dicky
with
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
could
look
out
through
the
barred
door
at
the
grass
of
the
little
plaza
at
a
row
of
orange
trees
and
the
red
tile
roofs
and
walls
of
a
line
of
insignificant
stores
at
sunset
along
a
path
across
this
plaza
came
a
melancholy
procession
of
women
bearing
plantains
cassaba
bread
and
fruit
each
coming
with
food
to
some
wretch
behind
those
bars
to
whom
she
still
clung
and
furnished
the
means
of
life
twice
a
day
morning
and
evening
they
were
permitted
to
come
water
was
furnished
to
her
compulsory
guests
by
the
republic
but
no
food
that
evening
dicky
name
was
called
by
the
sentry
and
he
stepped
before
the
bars
of
the
door
there
stood
his
little
saint
a
black
mantilla
draped
about
her
head
and
shoulders
her
face
like
glorified
melancholy
her
clear
eyes
gazing
longingly
at
him
as
if
they
might
draw
him
between
the
bars
to
her
she
brought
a
chicken
some
oranges
and
a
loaf
of
white
bread
a
soldier
inspected
the
food
and
passed
it
in
to
dicky
pasa
spoke
calmly
as
she
always
did
briefly
in
her
thrilling
tones
angel
of
my
life
she
said
let
it
not
be
long
that
thou
art
away
from
me
thou
knowest
that
life
is
not
a
thing
to
be
endured
with
thou
not
at
my
side
tell
me
if
i
can
do
aught
in
this
matter
if
not
i
will
wait
a
little
while
i
come
again
in
the
morning
dicky
with
his
shoes
removed
so
as
not
to
disturb
his
fellow
prisoners
tramped
the
floor
of
the
jail
half
the
night
condemning
his
lack
of
money
and
the
cause
of
it
whatever
that
might
have
been
he
knew
very
well
that
money
would
have
bought
his
release
at
once
for
two
days
succeeding
pasa
came
at
the
appointed
times
and
brought
him
food
he
eagerly
inquired
each
time
if
a
letter
or
package
had
come
for
him
and
she
mournfully
shook
her
head
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
she
brought
only
a
small
loaf
of
bread
there
were
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
she
seemed
as
calm
as
ever
by
jingo
said
dicky
who
seemed
to
speak
in
english
or
spanish
as
the
whim
seized
him
this
is
dry
provender
is
this
the
best
you
can
dig
up
for
a
fellow
pasa
looked
at
him
as
a
mother
looks
at
a
beloved
but
capricious
babe
think
better
of
it
she
said
in
a
low
voice
since
for
the
next
meal
there
will
be
nothing
the
last
is
spent
she
pressed
closer
against
the
grating
sell
the
goods
in
the
shop
take
anything
for
them
have
i
not
tried
did
i
not
offer
them
for
their
cost
not
even
one
would
any
one
give
there

not
one
in
this
town
to

dickee
malonee

clenched
his
teeth
grimly
that
the
he
growled
he
responsible
for
that
sentiment
wait
oh
wait
till
the
cards
are
all
out
pasa
lowered
her
voice
to
almost
a
whisper
and
listen
heart
of
my
heart
she
said
i
have
endeavoured
to
be
brave
but
i
can
not
live
without
thee
three
days
now
dicky
caught
a
faint
gleam
of
steel
from
the
folds
of
her
mantilla
for
once
she
looked
in
his
face
and
saw
it
without
a
smile
stern
menacing
and
purposeful
then
he
suddenly
raised
his
hand
and
his
smile
came
back
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
the
hoarse
signal
of
an
incoming
steamer
siren
sounded
in
the
harbour
dicky
called
to
the
sentry
who
was
pacing
before
the
door
what
steamer
comes
the
of
the
vesuvius
line
without
doubt
of
that
line
go
you
said
dicky
joyously
to
pasa
to
the
american
consul
tell
him
i
wish
to
speak
with
him
see
that
he
comes
at
once
and
look
you
let
me
see
a
different
look
in
those
eyes
for
i
promise
your
head
shall
rest
upon
this
arm
it
was
an
hour
before
the
consul
came
he
held
his
green
umbrella
under
his
arm
and
mopped
his
forehead
impatiently
now
see
here
maloney
he
began
captiously
you
fellows
seem
to
think
you
can
cut
up
any
kind
of
row
and
expect
me
to
pull
you
out
of
it
i
neither
the
war
department
nor
a
gold
mine
this
country
has
its
laws
you
know
and
there
one
against
pounding
the
senses
out
of
the
regular
army
you
irish
are
forever
getting
into
trouble
i
do
see
what
i
can
do
anything
like
tobacco
now
to
make
you
comfortable
or
newspapers
son
of
eli
interrupted
dicky
gravely
you
have
changed
an
iota
that
is
almost
a
duplicate
of
the
speech
you
made
when
old
koen
donkeys
and
geese
got
into
the
chapel
loft
and
the
culprits
wanted
to
hide
in
your
room
oh
heavens
exclaimed
the
consul
hurriedly
adjusting
his
spectacles
are
you
a
yale
man
too
were
you
in
that
crowd
i
seem
to
remember
any
one
with
red
any
one
named
maloney
such
a
lot
of
college
men
seem
to
have
misused
their
advantages
one
of
the
best
mathematicians
of
the
class
of
is
selling
lottery
tickets
in
belize
a
cornell
man
dropped
off
here
last
month
he
was
second
steward
on
a
guano
boat
i
write
to
the
department
if
you
like
maloney
or
if
there
any
tobacco
or
newspa
there
nothing
interrupted
dicky
shortly
but
this
you
go
tell
the
captain
of
the
that
dicky
maloney
wants
to
see
him
as
soon
as
he
can
conveniently
come
tell
him
where
i
am
hurry
all
the
consul
glad
to
be
let
off
so
easily
hurried
away
the
captain
of
the
a
stout
man
sicilian
born
soon
appeared
shoving
with
little
ceremony
through
the
guards
to
the
jail
door
the
vesuvius
fruit
company
had
a
habit
of
doing
things
that
way
in
anchuria
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
exceedingly
sorry
said
the
captain
to
see
this
occur
i
place
myself
at
your
service
maloney
what
you
need
shall
be
furnished
whatever
you
say
shall
be
done
dicky
looked
at
him
unsmilingly
his
red
hair
could
not
detract
from
his
attitude
of
severe
dignity
as
he
stood
tall
and
calm
with
his
now
grim
mouth
forming
a
horizontal
line
captain
de
lucco
i
believe
i
still
have
funds
in
the
hands
of
your
company
ample
and
personal
funds
i
ordered
a
remittance
last
week
the
money
has
not
arrived
you
know
what
is
needed
in
this
game
money
and
money
and
more
money
why
has
it
not
been
sent
by
the
replied
de
lucco
gesticulating
it
was
despatched
where
is
the
off
cape
antonio
i
spoke
her
with
a
broken
shaft
a
tramp
coaster
was
towing
her
back
to
new
orleans
i
brought
money
ashore
thinking
your
need
for
it
might
not
withstand
delay
in
this
envelope
is
one
thousand
dollars
there
is
more
if
you
need
it
mr
maloney
for
the
present
it
will
suffice
said
dicky
softening
as
he
crinkled
the
envelope
and
looked
down
at
the
thickness
of
smooth
dingy
bills
the
long
green
he
said
gently
with
a
new
reverence
in
his
gaze
is
there
anything
it
will
not
buy
captain
i
had
three
friends
replied
de
lucco
who
was
a
bit
of
a
philosopher
who
had
money
one
of
them
speculated
in
stocks
and
made
ten
million
another
is
in
heaven
and
the
third
married
a
poor
girl
whom
he
loved
the
answer
then
said
dicky
is
held
by
the
almighty
wall
street
and
cupid
so
the
question
remains
this
queried
the
captain
including
dicky
surroundings
in
a
significant
gesture
of
his
hand
is
it
it
is
not
it
is
not
connected
with
the
business
of
your
little
shop
there
is
no
failure
in
your
plans
no
no
said
dicky
this
is
merely
the
result
of
a
little
private
affair
of
mine
a
digression
from
the
regular
line
of
business
they
say
for
a
complete
life
a
man
must
know
poverty
love
and
war
but
they
do
go
well
together
no
there
is
no
failure
in
my
business
the
little
shop
is
doing
very
well
when
the
captain
had
departed
dicky
called
the
sergeant
of
the
jail
squad
and
asked
am
i
by
the
military
or
by
the
civil
authority
surely
there
is
no
martial
law
in
effect
now
señor
now
go
or
send
to
the
alcalde
the
de
la
and
the
de
los
tell
them
i
am
prepared
at
once
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
a
folded
bill
of
the
long
green
slid
into
the
sergeant
hand
then
dicky
smile
came
back
again
for
he
knew
that
the
hours
of
his
captivity
were
numbered
and
he
hummed
in
time
with
the
tread
hanging
men
and
women
now
for
lacking
of
the
so
that
night
dicky
sat
by
the
window
of
the
room
over
his
shop
and
his
little
saint
sat
close
by
working
at
something
silken
and
dainty
dicky
was
thoughtful
and
grave
his
red
hair
was
in
an
unusual
state
of
disorder
pasa
fingers
often
ached
to
smooth
and
arrange
it
but
dicky
would
never
allow
it
he
was
poring
over
a
great
litter
of
maps
and
books
and
papers
on
his
table
until
that
perpendicular
line
came
between
his
brows
that
always
distressed
pasa
presently
she
went
and
brought
his
hat
and
stood
with
it
until
he
looked
up
inquiringly
it
is
sad
for
you
here
she
explained
go
out
and
drink
come
back
when
you
get
that
smile
you
used
to
wear
that
is
what
i
wish
to
see
dicky
laughed
and
threw
down
his
papers
the
stage
is
past
it
has
served
its
turn
perhaps
after
all
there
was
less
entered
my
mouth
and
more
my
ears
than
people
thought
but
there
will
be
no
more
maps
or
frowns
i
promise
you
that
come
they
sat
upon
a
reed
at
the
window
and
watched
the
quivering
gleams
from
the
lights
of
the
reflected
in
the
harbour
presently
pasa
rippled
out
one
of
her
infrequent
chirrups
of
audible
laughter
i
was
thinking
she
began
anticipating
dicky
question
of
the
foolish
things
girls
have
in
their
minds
because
i
went
to
school
in
the
states
i
used
to
have
ambitions
nothing
less
than
to
be
the
president
wife
would
satisfy
me
and
look
thou
red
picaroon
to
what
obscure
fate
thou
hast
stolen
me
do
give
up
hope
said
dicky
smiling
more
than
one
irishman
has
been
the
ruler
of
a
south
american
country
there
was
a
dictator
of
chili
named
why
not
a
president
maloney
of
anchuria
say
the
word
and
we
make
the
race
no
no
no
thou
reckless
one
sighed
pasa
i
am
content
she
laid
her
head
against
his
arm
here
xvi
rouge
et
noir
it
has
been
indicated
that
disaffection
followed
the
elevation
of
losada
to
the
presidency
this
feeling
continued
to
grow
throughout
the
entire
republic
there
seemed
to
be
a
spirit
of
silent
sullen
discontent
even
the
old
liberal
party
to
which
goodwin
zavalla
and
other
patriots
had
lent
their
aid
was
disappointed
losada
had
failed
to
become
a
popular
idol
fresh
taxes
fresh
import
duties
and
more
than
all
his
tolerance
of
the
outrageous
oppression
of
citizens
by
the
military
had
rendered
him
the
most
obnoxious
president
since
the
despicable
alforan
the
majority
of
his
own
cabinet
were
out
of
sympathy
with
him
the
army
which
he
had
courted
by
giving
it
license
to
tyrannize
had
been
his
main
and
thus
far
adequate
support
but
the
most
impolitic
of
the
administration
moves
had
been
when
it
antagonized
the
vesuvius
fruit
company
an
organization
plying
twelve
steamers
and
with
a
cash
capital
somewhat
larger
than
surplus
and
debt
combined
reasonably
an
established
concern
like
the
vesuvius
would
become
irritated
at
having
a
small
retail
republic
with
no
rating
at
all
attempt
to
squeeze
it
so
when
the
government
proxies
applied
for
a
subsidy
they
encountered
a
polite
refusal
the
president
at
once
retaliated
by
clapping
an
export
duty
of
one
per
bunch
on
bananas
a
thing
unprecedented
in
countries
the
vesuvius
company
had
invested
large
sums
in
wharves
and
plantations
along
the
anchurian
coast
their
agents
had
erected
fine
homes
in
the
towns
where
they
had
their
headquarters
and
heretofore
had
worked
with
the
republic
in
and
with
advantage
to
both
it
would
lose
an
immense
sum
if
compelled
to
move
out
the
selling
price
of
bananas
from
vera
cruz
to
trinidad
was
three
per
bunch
this
new
duty
of
one
would
have
ruined
the
fruit
growers
in
anchuria
and
have
seriously
discommoded
the
vesuvius
company
had
it
declined
to
pay
it
but
for
some
reason
the
vesuvius
continued
to
buy
anchurian
fruit
paying
four
for
it
and
not
suffering
the
growers
to
bear
the
loss
this
apparent
victory
deceived
his
excellency
and
he
began
to
hunger
for
more
of
it
he
sent
an
emissary
to
request
a
conference
with
a
representative
of
the
fruit
company
the
vesuvius
sent
franzoni
a
little
stout
cheerful
man
always
cool
and
whistling
airs
from
verdi
operas
señor
espirition
of
the
office
of
the
minister
of
finance
attempted
the
sandbagging
in
behalf
of
anchuria
the
meeting
took
place
in
the
cabin
of
the
of
the
vesuvius
line
señor
espirition
opened
negotiations
by
announcing
that
the
government
contemplated
the
building
of
a
railroad
to
skirt
the
alluvial
coast
lands
after
touching
upon
the
benefits
such
a
road
would
confer
upon
the
interests
of
the
vesuvius
he
reached
the
definite
suggestion
that
a
contribution
to
the
road
expenses
of
say
fifty
thousand
would
not
be
more
than
an
equivalent
to
benefits
received
franzoni
denied
that
his
company
would
receive
any
benefits
from
a
contemplated
road
as
its
representative
he
must
decline
to
contribute
fifty
thousand
but
he
would
assume
the
responsibility
of
offering
did
señor
espirition
understand
señor
franzoni
to
mean
thousand
by
no
means
and
in
silver
not
in
gold
your
offer
insults
my
government
cried
señor
espirition
rising
with
indignation
then
said
franzoni
in
warning
tone
will
change
the
offer
was
never
changed
could
franzoni
have
meant
the
government
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
anchuria
when
the
winter
season
opened
at
coralio
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
of
administration
so
when
the
government
and
society
made
its
annual
exodus
to
the
seashore
it
was
evident
that
the
presidential
advent
would
not
be
celebrated
by
unlimited
rejoicing
the
tenth
of
november
was
the
day
set
for
the
entrance
into

of

in
grand
procession
to
coralio
where
on
the
day
of
their
coming
festivities
and
ceremonies
abound
but
this
season
saw
an
ominous
dawning
of
the
tenth
of
november
although
the
rainy
season
was
over
the
day
seemed
to
hark
back
to
reeking
june
a
fine
drizzle
of
rain
fell
all
during
the
forenoon
the
procession
entered
coralio
amid
a
strange
silence
president
losada
was
an
elderly
man
grizzly
bearded
with
a
considerable
ratio
of
indian
blood
revealed
in
his
cinnamon
complexion
his
carriage
headed
the
procession
surrounded
and
guarded
by
captain
cruz
and
his
famous
troop
of
one
hundred
light
horse
ciento
colonel
rocas
followed
with
a
regiment
of
the
regular
army
the
president
sharp
beady
eyes
glanced
about
him
for
the
expected
demonstration
of
welcome
but
he
faced
a
stolid
indifferent
array
of
citizens
the
anchurians
are
by
birth
and
habit
and
they
turned
out
to
their
last
unit
to
witness
the
scene
but
they
maintained
an
accusive
silence
they
crowded
the
streets
to
the
very
wheel
ruts
they
covered
the
red
tile
roofs
to
the
eaves
but
there
was
never
a
from
them
no
wreaths
of
palm
and
lemon
branches
or
gorgeous
strings
of
paper
roses
hung
from
the
windows
and
balconies
as
was
the
custom
there
was
an
apathy
a
dull
dissenting
disapprobation
that
was
the
more
ominous
because
it
puzzled
no
one
feared
an
outburst
a
revolt
of
the
discontents
for
they
had
no
leader
the
president
and
those
loyal
to
him
had
never
even
heard
whispered
a
name
among
them
capable
of
crystallizing
the
dissatisfaction
into
opposition
no
there
could
be
no
danger
the
people
always
procured
a
new
idol
before
they
destroyed
an
old
one
at
length
after
a
prodigious
galloping
and
curvetting
of
majors
colonels
and
epauletted
generals
the
procession
formed
for
its
annual
progress
down
the
calle
grande
to
the
casa
morena
where
the
ceremony
of
welcome
to
the
visiting
president
always
took
place
the
swiss
band
led
the
line
of
march
after
it
pranced
the
local
mounted
and
a
detachment
of
his
troops
next
came
a
carriage
with
four
members
of
the
cabinet
conspicuous
among
them
the
minister
of
war
old
general
pilar
with
his
white
moustache
and
his
soldierly
bearing
then
the
president
vehicle
containing
also
the
ministers
of
finance
and
state
and
surrounded
by
captain
light
horse
formed
in
a
close
double
file
of
fours
following
them
the
rest
of
the
officials
of
state
the
judges
and
distinguished
military
and
social
ornaments
of
public
and
private
life
as
the
band
struck
up
and
the
movement
began
like
a
bird
of
the
the
swiftest
steamship
of
the
vesuvius
line
glided
into
the
harbour
in
plain
view
of
the
president
and
his
train
of
course
there
was
nothing
menacing
about
its
arrival
a
business
firm
does
not
go
to
war
with
a
nation
but
it
reminded
señor
espirition
and
others
in
those
carriages
that
the
vesuvius
fruit
company
was
undoubtedly
carrying
something
up
its
sleeve
for
them
by
the
time
the
van
of
the
procession
had
reached
the
government
building
captain
cronin
of
the
and
vincenti
member
of
the
vesuvius
company
had
landed
and
were
pushing
their
way
bluff
hearty
and
nonchalant
through
the
crowd
on
the
narrow
sidewalk
clad
in
white
linen
big
debonair
with
an
air
of
authority
they
made
conspicuous
figures
among
the
dark
mass
of
unimposing
anchurians
as
they
penetrated
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
steps
of
the
casa
morena
looking
easily
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
they
perceived
another
that
towered
above
the
undersized
natives
it
was
the
fiery
poll
of
dicky
maloney
against
the
wall
close
by
the
lower
step
and
his
broad
seductive
grin
showed
that
he
recognized
their
presence
dicky
had
attired
himself
becomingly
for
the
festive
occasion
in
a
black
suit
pasa
was
close
by
his
side
her
head
covered
with
the
ubiquitous
black
mantilla
vincenti
looked
at
her
attentively
botticelli
madonna
he
remarked
gravely
i
wonder
when
she
got
into
the
game
i
do
like
his
getting
tangled
with
the
women
i
hoped
he
would
keep
away
from
them
captain
cronin
laugh
almost
drew
attention
from
the
parade
with
that
head
of
hair
keep
away
from
the
women
and
a
maloney
has
he
got
a
license
but
nonsense
aside
what
do
you
think
of
the
prospects
it
a
species
of
filibustering
out
of
my
line
vincenti
glanced
again
at
dicky
head
and
smiled
et
he
said
there
you
have
it
make
your
play
gentlemen
our
money
is
on
the
red
the
lad
game
said
cronin
with
a
commending
look
at
the
tall
easy
figure
by
the
steps
but
is
all
like
theatricals
to
me
the
talk
bigger
than
the
stage
there
a
smell
of
gasoline
in
the
air
and
they
their
own
audience
and
they
ceased
talking
for
general
pilar
had
descended
from
the
first
carriage
and
had
taken
his
stand
upon
the
top
step
of
casa
morena
as
the
oldest
member
of
the
cabinet
custom
had
decreed
that
he
should
make
the
address
of
welcome
presenting
the
keys
of
the
official
residence
to
the
president
at
its
close
general
pilar
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
citizens
of
the
republic
hero
of
three
wars
and
innumerable
revolutions
he
was
an
honoured
guest
at
european
courts
and
camps
an
eloquent
speaker
and
a
friend
to
the
people
he
represented
the
highest
type
of
the
anchurians
holding
in
his
hand
the
gilt
keys
of
casa
morena
he
began
his
address
in
a
historical
form
touching
upon
each
administration
and
the
advance
of
civilization
and
prosperity
from
the
first
dim
striving
after
liberty
down
to
present
times
arriving
at
the
régime
of
president
losada
at
which
point
according
to
precedent
he
should
have
delivered
a
eulogy
upon
its
wise
conduct
and
the
happiness
of
the
people
general
pilar
paused
then
he
silently
held
up
the
bunch
of
keys
high
above
his
head
with
his
eyes
closely
regarding
it
the
ribbon
with
which
they
were
bound
fluttered
in
the
breeze
it
still
blows
cried
the
speaker
exultantly
citizens
of
anchuria
give
thanks
to
the
saints
this
night
that
our
air
is
still
free
thus
disposing
of
losada
administration
he
abruptly
reverted
to
that
of
olivarra
anchuria
most
popular
ruler
olivarra
had
been
assassinated
nine
years
before
while
in
the
prime
of
life
and
usefulness
a
faction
of
the
liberal
party
led
by
losada
himself
had
been
accused
of
the
deed
whether
guilty
or
not
it
was
eight
years
before
the
ambitious
and
scheming
losada
had
gained
his
goal
upon
this
theme
general
pilar
eloquence
was
loosed
he
drew
the
picture
of
the
beneficent
olivarra
with
a
loving
hand
he
reminded
the
people
of
the
peace
the
security
and
the
happiness
they
had
enjoyed
during
that
period
he
recalled
in
vivid
detail
and
with
significant
contrast
the
last
winter
sojourn
of
president
olivarra
in
coralio
when
his
appearance
at
their
fiestas
was
the
signal
for
thundering
of
love
and
approbation
the
first
public
expression
of
sentiment
from
the
people
that
day
followed
a
low
sustained
murmur
went
among
them
like
the
surf
rolling
along
the
shore
ten
dollars
to
a
dinner
at
the
saint
charles
remarked
vincenti
that
wins
i
never
bet
against
my
own
interests
said
captain
cronin
lighting
a
cigar
old
boy
for
his
age
what
he
talking
about
my
spanish
replied
vincenti
runs
about
ten
words
to
the
minute
his
is
something
around
two
hundred
whatever
he
saying
getting
them
warmed
up
friends
and
brothers
general
pilar
was
saying
could
i
reach
out
my
hand
this
day
across
the
lamentable
silence
of
the
grave
to
olivarra
good
to
the
ruler
who
was
one
of
you
whose
tears
fell
when
you
sorrowed
and
whose
smile
followed
your
joy
i
would
bring
him
back
to
you
but
olivarra
is
dead
dead
at
the
hands
of
a
craven
assassin
the
speaker
turned
and
gazed
boldly
into
the
carriage
of
the
president
his
arm
remained
extended
aloft
as
if
to
sustain
his
peroration
the
president
was
listening
aghast
at
this
remarkable
address
of
welcome
he
was
sunk
back
upon
his
seat
trembling
with
rage
and
dumb
surprise
his
dark
hands
tightly
gripping
the
carriage
cushions
half
rising
he
extended
one
arm
toward
the
speaker
and
shouted
a
harsh
command
at
captain
cruz
the
leader
of
the
flying
hundred
sat
his
horse
immovable
with
folded
arms
giving
no
sign
of
having
heard
losada
sank
back
again
his
dark
features
distinctly
paling
who
says
that
olivarra
is
dead
suddenly
cried
the
speaker
his
voice
old
as
he
was
sounding
like
a
battle
trumpet
his
body
lies
in
the
grave
but
to
the
people
he
loved
he
has
bequeathed
his
spirit
yes
more
his
learning
his
courage
his
kindness
yes
more
his
youth
his
image
people
of
anchuria
have
you
forgotten
ramon
the
son
of
olivarra
cronin
and
vincenti
watching
closely
saw
dicky
maloney
suddenly
raise
his
hat
tear
off
his
shock
of
red
hair
leap
up
the
steps
and
stand
at
the
side
of
general
pilar
the
minister
of
war
laid
his
arm
across
the
young
man
shoulders
all
who
had
known
president
olivarra
saw
again
his
same
pose
the
same
frank
undaunted
expression
the
same
high
forehead
with
the
peculiar
line
of
the
clustering
crisp
black
hair
general
pilar
was
an
experienced
orator
he
seized
the
moment
of
breathless
silence
that
preceded
the
storm
citizens
of
anchuria
he
trumpeted
holding
aloft
the
keys
to
casa
morena
i
am
here
to
deliver
these
keys
the
keys
to
your
homes
and
liberty
to
your
chosen
president
shall
i
deliver
them
to
enrico
olivarra
assassin
or
to
his
son
olivarra
olivarra
the
crowd
shrieked
and
howled
all
vociferated
the
magic
name
men
women
children
and
the
parrots
and
the
enthusiasm
was
not
confined
to
the
blood
of
the
plebs
colonel
rocas
ascended
the
steps
and
laid
his
sword
theatrically
at
young
ramon
olivarra
feet
four
members
of
the
cabinet
embraced
him
captain
cruz
gave
a
command
and
twenty
of
ciento
dismounted
and
arranged
themselves
in
a
cordon
about
the
steps
of
casa
morena
but
ramon
olivarra
seized
that
moment
to
prove
himself
a
born
genius
and
politician
he
waved
those
soldiers
aside
and
descended
the
steps
to
the
street
there
without
losing
his
dignity
or
the
distinguished
elegance
that
the
loss
of
his
red
hair
brought
him
he
took
the
proletariat
to
his
bosom
the
barefooted
the
dirty
indians
caribs
babies
beggars
old
young
saints
soldiers
and
sinners
he
missed
none
of
them
while
this
act
of
the
drama
was
being
presented
the
scene
shifters
had
been
busy
at
the
duties
that
had
been
assigned
to
them
two
of
cruz
dragoons
had
seized
the
bridle
reins
of
losada
horses
others
formed
a
close
guard
around
the
carriage
and
they
galloped
off
with
the
tyrant
and
his
two
unpopular
ministers
no
doubt
a
place
had
been
prepared
for
them
there
are
a
number
of
stone
apartments
in
coralio
wins
said
vincenti
calmly
lighting
another
cigar
captain
cronin
had
been
intently
watching
the
vicinity
of
the
stone
steps
for
some
time
good
boy
he
exclaimed
suddenly
as
if
relieved
i
wondered
if
he
was
going
to
forget
his
kathleen
mavourneen
young
olivarra
had
reascended
the
steps
and
spoken
a
few
words
to
general
pilar
then
that
distinguished
veteran
descended
to
the
ground
and
approached
pasa
who
still
stood
where
dicky
had
left
her
with
his
plumed
hat
in
his
hand
and
his
medals
and
decorations
shining
on
his
breast
the
general
spoke
to
her
and
gave
her
his
arm
and
they
went
up
the
stone
steps
of
the
casa
morena
together
and
then
ramon
olivarra
stepped
forward
and
took
both
her
hands
before
all
the
people
and
while
the
cheering
was
breaking
out
afresh
everywhere
captain
cronin
and
vincenti
turned
and
walked
back
toward
the
shore
where
the
gig
was
waiting
for
them
there
be
another
in
the
morning
said
vincenti
musingly
as
a
rule
they
are
not
as
reliable
as
the
elected
ones
but
this
youngster
seems
to
have
some
good
stuff
in
him
he
planned
and
manoeuvred
the
entire
campaign
widow
you
know
was
wealthy
after
her
husband
was
assassinated
she
went
to
the
states
and
educated
her
son
at
yale
the
vesuvius
company
hunted
him
up
and
backed
him
in
the
little
game
it
a
glorious
thing
said
cronin
half
jestingly
to
be
able
to
discharge
a
government
and
insert
one
of
your
own
choosing
in
these
days
oh
it
is
only
a
matter
of
business
said
vincenti
stopping
and
offering
the
stump
of
his
cigar
to
a
monkey
that
swung
down
from
a
lime
tree
and
that
is
what
moves
the
world
of
that
extra
on
the
price
of
bananas
had
to
go
we
took
the
shortest
way
of
removing
it
xvii
two
recalls
there
remains
three
duties
to
be
performed
before
the
curtain
falls
upon
the
patched
comedy
two
have
been
promised
the
third
is
no
less
obligatory
it
was
set
forth
in
the
programme
of
this
tropic
vaudeville
that
it
would
be
made
known
why
shorty
of
the
columbia
detective
agency
lost
his
position
also
that
smith
should
come
again
to
tell
us
what
mystery
he
followed
that
night
on
the
shores
of
anchuria
when
he
strewed
so
many
cigar
stumps
around
the
cocoanut
palm
during
his
lonely
night
vigil
on
the
beach
these
things
were
promised
but
a
bigger
thing
yet
remains
to
be
accomplished
the
clearing
up
of
a
seeming
wrong
that
has
been
done
according
to
the
array
of
chronicled
facts
truthfully
set
forth
that
have
been
presented
and
one
voice
speaking
shall
do
these
three
things
two
men
sat
on
a
stringer
of
a
north
river
pier
in
the
city
of
new
york
a
steamer
from
the
tropics
had
begun
to
unload
bananas
and
oranges
on
the
pier
now
and
then
a
banana
or
two
would
fall
from
an
overripe
bunch
and
one
of
the
two
men
would
shamble
forward
seize
the
fruit
and
return
to
share
it
with
his
companion
one
of
the
men
was
in
the
ultimate
stage
of
deterioration
as
far
as
rain
and
wind
and
sun
could
wreck
the
garments
he
wore
it
had
been
done
in
his
person
the
ravages
of
drink
were
as
plainly
visible
and
yet
upon
his
rubicund
nose
was
jauntily
perched
a
pair
of
shining
and
flawless
glasses
the
other
man
was
not
so
far
gone
upon
the
descending
highway
of
the
incompetents
truly
the
flower
of
his
manhood
had
gone
to
seed
seed
that
perhaps
no
soil
might
sprout
but
there
were
still
along
where
he
travelled
through
which
he
might
yet
regain
the
pathway
of
usefulness
without
disturbing
the
slumbering
miracles
this
man
was
short
and
compactly
built
he
had
an
oblique
dead
eye
like
that
of
a
and
the
moustache
of
a
cocktail
mixer
we
know
the
eye
and
the
moustache
we
know
that
smith
of
the
luxurious
yacht
the
gorgeous
raiment
the
mysterious
mission
the
magic
disappearance
has
come
again
though
shorn
of
the
accessories
of
his
former
state
at
his
third
banana
the
man
with
the
nose
glasses
spat
it
from
him
with
a
shudder
deuce
take
all
fruit
he
remarked
in
a
patrician
tone
of
disgust
i
lived
for
two
years
where
these
things
grow
the
memory
of
their
taste
lingers
with
you
the
oranges
are
not
so
bad
just
see
if
you
can
gather
a
couple
of
them
when
the
next
broken
crate
comes
up
did
you
live
down
with
the
monkeys
asked
the
other
made
tepidly
garrulous
by
the
sunshine
and
the
alleviating
meal
of
juicy
fruit
i
was
down
there
once
myself
but
only
for
a
few
hours
that
was
when
i
was
with
the
columbia
detective
agency
the
monkey
people
did
me
up
i
have
my
job
yet
if
it
had
been
for
them
i
tell
you
about
it
one
day
the
chief
sent
a
note
around
to
the
office
that
read
here
at
once
for
a
big
piece
of
business
i
was
the
crack
detective
of
the
agency
at
that
time
they
always
handed
me
the
big
jobs
the
address
the
chief
wrote
from
was
down
in
the
wall
street
district
when
i
got
there
i
found
him
in
a
private
office
with
a
lot
of
directors
who
were
looking
pretty
fuzzy
they
stated
the
case
the
president
of
the
republic
insurance
company
had
skipped
with
about
a
tenth
of
a
million
dollars
in
cash
the
directors
wanted
him
back
pretty
bad
but
they
wanted
the
money
worse
they
said
they
needed
it
they
had
traced
the
old
gent
movements
to
where
he
boarded
a
tramp
fruit
steamer
bound
for
south
america
that
same
morning
with
his
daughter
and
a
big
gripsack
all
the
family
he
had
one
of
the
directors
had
his
steam
yacht
coaled
and
with
steam
up
ready
for
the
trip
and
he
turned
her
over
to
me
cart
blongsh
in
four
hours
i
was
on
board
of
her
and
hot
on
the
trail
of
the
fruit
tub
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
where
old
wahrfield
that
was
his
name
churchill
wahrfield
would
head
for
at
that
time
we
had
a
treaty
with
about
every
foreign
country
except
belgium
and
that
banana
republic
anchuria
there
was
a
photo
of
old
wahrfield
to
be
had
in
new
york
he
had
been
foxy
there
but
i
had
his
description
and
besides
the
lady
with
him
would
be
a
anywhere
she
was
one
of
the
in
society
not
the
kind
that
have
their
pictures
in
the
sunday
papers
but
the
real
sort
that
open
chrysanthemum
shows
and
christen
battleships
well
sir
we
never
got
a
sight
of
that
fruit
tub
on
the
road
the
ocean
is
a
pretty
big
place
and
i
guess
we
took
different
paths
across
it
but
we
kept
going
toward
this
anchuria
where
the
fruiter
was
bound
for
we
struck
the
monkey
coast
one
afternoon
about
four
there
was
a
steamer
off
shore
taking
on
bananas
the
monkeys
were
loading
her
up
with
big
barges
it
might
be
the
one
the
old
man
had
taken
and
it
might
not
i
went
ashore
to
look
around
the
scenery
was
pretty
good
i
never
saw
any
finer
on
the
new
york
stage
i
struck
an
american
on
shore
a
big
cool
chap
standing
around
with
the
monkeys
he
showed
me
the
consul
office
the
consul
was
a
nice
young
fellow
he
said
the
fruiter
was
the
running
generally
to
new
orleans
but
took
her
last
cargo
to
new
york
then
i
was
sure
my
people
were
on
board
although
everybody
told
me
that
no
passengers
had
landed
i
did
think
they
would
land
until
after
dark
for
they
might
have
been
shy
about
it
on
account
of
seeing
that
yacht
of
mine
hanging
around
so
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
wait
and
nab
when
they
came
ashore
i
could
arrest
old
wahrfield
without
extradition
papers
but
my
play
was
to
get
the
cash
they
generally
give
up
if
you
strike
when
they
tired
and
rattled
and
short
on
nerve
after
dark
i
sat
under
a
cocoanut
tree
on
the
beach
for
a
while
and
then
i
walked
around
and
investigated
that
town
some
and
it
was
enough
to
give
you
the
lions
if
a
man
could
stay
in
new
york
and
be
honest
he
better
do
it
than
to
hit
that
monkey
town
with
a
million
dinky
little
mud
houses
grass
over
your
shoe
tops
in
the
streets
ladies
in
walking
around
smoking
cigars
tree
frogs
rattling
like
a
hose
cart
going
to
a
ten
blow
big
mountains
dropping
gravel
in
the
back
yards
and
the
sea
licking
the
paint
off
in
front
no
sir
a
man
had
better
be
in
god
country
living
on
free
lunch
than
there
the
main
street
ran
along
the
beach
and
i
walked
down
it
and
then
turned
up
a
kind
of
lane
where
the
houses
were
made
of
poles
and
straw
i
wanted
to
see
what
the
monkeys
did
when
they
climbing
cocoanut
trees
the
very
first
shack
i
looked
in
i
saw
my
people
they
must
have
come
ashore
while
i
was
promenading
a
man
about
fifty
smooth
face
heavy
eyebrows
dressed
in
black
broadcloth
looking
like
he
was
just
about
to
say
any
little
boy
in
the
sunday
school
answer
that
he
was
freezing
on
to
a
grip
that
weighed
like
a
dozen
gold
bricks
and
a
swell
girl
a
regular
peach
with
a
fifth
avenue
cut
was
sitting
on
a
wooden
chair
an
old
black
woman
was
fixing
some
coffee
and
beans
on
a
table
the
light
they
had
come
from
a
lantern
hung
on
a
nail
i
went
and
stood
in
the
door
and
they
looked
at
me
and
i
said
wahrfield
you
are
my
prisoner
i
hope
for
the
lady
sake
you
will
take
the
matter
sensibly
you
know
why
i
want
you
are
you
says
the
old
gent
says
i
the
columbia
detective
agency
and
now
sir
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
good
advice
you
go
back
and
take
your
medicine
like
a
man
hand
back
the
boodle
and
maybe
they
let
you
off
light
go
back
easy
and
i
put
in
a
word
for
you
give
you
five
minutes
to
decide
i
pulled
out
my
watch
and
waited
then
the
young
lady
chipped
in
she
was
one
of
the
genuine
you
could
tell
by
the
way
her
clothes
fit
and
the
style
she
had
that
fifth
avenue
was
made
for
her
inside
she
says
stand
in
the
door
and
disturb
the
whole
street
with
that
suit
of
clothes
now
what
is
it
you
want
minutes
gone
i
said
tell
you
again
while
the
other
two
tick
off
admit
being
the
president
of
the
republic
wo
you
am
says
he
then
says
i
ought
to
be
plain
to
you
wanted
in
new
york
churchill
wahrfield
president
of
the
republic
insurance
company
the
funds
belonging
to
said
company
now
in
that
grip
in
the
unlawful
possession
of
said
churchill
wahrfield
says
the
young
lady
as
if
she
was
thinking
want
to
take
us
back
to
new
york
take
wahrfield
there
no
charge
against
you
miss
there
be
no
objection
of
course
to
your
returning
with
your
father
of
a
sudden
the
girl
gave
a
tiny
scream
and
grabbed
the
old
boy
around
the
neck
father
father
she
says
kind
of
contralto
this
be
true
have
you
taken
money
that
is
not
yours
speak
father
it
made
you
shiver
to
hear
the
tremolo
stop
she
put
on
her
voice
the
old
boy
looked
pretty
bughouse
when
she
first
grappled
him
but
she
went
on
whispering
in
his
ear
and
patting
his
off
shoulder
till
he
stood
still
but
sweating
a
little
she
got
him
to
one
side
and
they
talked
together
a
minute
and
then
he
put
on
some
gold
eyeglasses
and
walked
up
and
handed
me
the
grip
detective
he
says
talking
a
little
broken
conclude
to
return
with
you
i
have
finished
to
discover
that
life
on
this
desolate
and
displeased
coast
would
be
worse
than
to
die
itself
i
will
go
back
and
hurl
myself
upon
the
mercy
of
the
republic
company
have
you
brought
a
sheep
says
i
have
a
single
cut
in
the
young
lady
get
funny
father
is
of
german
birth
and
does
speak
perfect
english
how
did
you
come
the
girl
was
all
broke
up
she
had
a
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
kept
saying
every
little
bit
father
father
she
walked
up
to
me
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
clothes
that
had
pained
her
at
first
i
smelt
a
million
violets
she
was
a
lulu
i
told
her
i
came
in
a
private
yacht
she
says
take
us
away
from
this
horrid
country
at
once
can
you
will
you
say
you
will
try
i
said
concealing
the
fact
that
i
was
dying
to
get
them
on
salt
water
before
they
could
change
their
mind
one
thing
they
both
kicked
against
was
going
through
the
town
to
the
boat
landing
said
they
dreaded
publicity
and
now
that
they
were
going
to
return
they
had
a
hope
that
the
thing
might
yet
be
kept
out
of
the
papers
they
swore
they
would
go
unless
i
got
them
out
to
the
yacht
without
any
one
knowing
it
so
i
agreed
to
humour
them
the
sailors
who
rowed
me
ashore
were
playing
billiards
in
a
near
the
water
waiting
for
orders
and
i
proposed
to
have
them
take
the
boat
down
the
beach
half
a
mile
or
so
and
take
us
up
there
how
to
get
them
word
was
the
question
for
i
could
leave
the
grip
with
the
prisoner
and
i
could
take
it
with
me
not
knowing
but
what
the
monkeys
might
stick
me
up
the
young
lady
says
the
old
coloured
woman
would
take
them
a
note
i
sat
down
and
wrote
it
and
gave
it
to
the
dame
with
plain
directions
what
to
do
and
she
grins
like
a
baboon
and
shakes
her
head
then
wahrfield
handed
her
a
string
of
foreign
dialect
and
she
nods
her
head
and
says
señor
maybe
fifty
times
and
lights
out
with
the
note
augusta
only
understands
german
said
miss
wahrfield
smiling
at
me
stopped
in
her
house
to
ask
where
we
could
find
lodging
and
she
insisted
upon
our
having
coffee
she
tells
us
she
was
raised
in
a
german
family
in
san
domingo
likely
i
said
you
can
search
me
for
german
words
except
and
i
would
have
called
that
see
señor
french
though
on
a
gamble
well
we
three
made
a
sneak
around
the
edge
of
town
so
as
not
to
be
seen
we
got
tangled
in
vines
and
ferns
and
the
banana
bushes
and
tropical
scenery
a
good
deal
the
monkey
suburbs
was
as
wild
as
places
in
central
park
we
came
out
on
the
beach
a
good
half
mile
below
a
brown
chap
was
lying
asleep
under
a
cocoanut
tree
with
a
musket
beside
him
wahrfield
takes
up
the
gun
and
pitches
it
into
the
sea
coast
is
guarded
he
says
and
plots
ripen
like
fruit
he
pointed
to
the
sleeping
man
who
never
stirred
he
says
perform
trusts
children
i
saw
our
boat
coming
and
i
struck
a
match
and
lit
a
piece
of
newspaper
to
show
them
where
we
were
in
thirty
minutes
we
were
on
board
the
yacht
the
first
thing
wahrfield
and
his
daughter
and
i
took
the
grip
into
the
owner
cabin
opened
it
up
and
took
an
inventory
there
was
one
hundred
and
five
thousand
dollars
united
states
treasury
notes
in
it
besides
a
lot
of
diamond
jewelry
and
a
couple
of
hundred
havana
cigars
i
gave
the
old
man
the
cigars
and
a
receipt
for
the
rest
of
the
lot
as
agent
for
the
company
and
locked
the
stuff
up
in
my
private
quarters
i
never
had
a
pleasanter
trip
than
that
one
after
we
got
to
sea
the
young
lady
turned
out
to
be
the
jolliest
ever
the
very
first
time
we
sat
down
to
dinner
and
the
steward
filled
her
glass
with
champagne
that
director
yacht
was
a
regular
floating
she
winks
at
me
and
says
the
use
to
borrow
trouble
mr
fly
cop
here
hoping
you
may
live
to
eat
the
hen
that
scratches
on
your
grave
there
was
a
piano
on
board
and
she
sat
down
to
it
and
sung
better
than
you
give
up
two
cases
to
hear
plenty
times
she
knew
about
nine
operas
clear
through
she
was
sure
enough
and
swell
she
was
one
of
the
others
kind
she
belonged
on
the
special
mention
list
the
old
man
too
perked
up
amazingly
on
the
way
he
passed
the
cigars
and
says
to
me
once
quite
chipper
out
of
a
cloud
of
smoke
somehow
i
think
the
republic
company
will
not
give
me
the
much
trouble
guard
well
the
gripvalise
of
the
money
for
that
it
must
be
returned
to
them
that
it
belongs
when
we
finish
to
arrive
when
we
landed
in
new
york
i
to
the
chief
to
meet
us
in
that
director
office
we
got
in
a
cab
and
went
there
i
carried
the
grip
and
we
walked
in
and
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
chief
had
got
together
that
same
old
crowd
of
moneybugs
with
pink
faces
and
white
vests
to
see
us
march
in
i
set
the
grip
on
the
table
the
money
i
said
your
prisoner
said
the
chief
i
pointed
to
wahrfield
and
he
stepped
forward
and
says
honour
of
a
word
with
you
sir
to
explain
he
and
the
chief
went
into
another
room
and
stayed
ten
minutes
when
they
came
back
the
chief
looked
as
black
as
a
ton
of
coal
this
gentleman
he
says
to
me
this
valise
in
his
possession
when
you
first
saw
him
did
said
i
the
chief
took
up
the
grip
and
handed
it
to
the
prisoner
with
a
bow
and
says
to
the
director
crowd
any
of
you
recognize
this
gentleman
they
all
shook
their
pink
faces
me
to
present
he
goes
on
señor
miraflores
president
of
the
republic
of
anchuria
the
señor
has
generously
consented
to
overlook
this
outrageous
blunder
on
condition
that
we
undertake
to
secure
him
against
the
annoyance
of
public
comment
it
is
a
concession
on
his
part
to
overlook
an
insult
for
which
he
might
claim
international
redress
i
think
we
can
gratefully
promise
him
secrecy
in
the
matter
they
gave
him
a
pink
nod
all
round
he
says
to
me
a
private
detective
you
wasted
in
a
war
where
kidnapping
governments
is
in
the
rules
you
be
invaluable
come
down
to
the
office
at
eleven
i
knew
what
that
meant
that
the
president
of
the
monkeys
says
i
why
could
he
have
said
so
would
it
jar
you

the

litter
of
sketches
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
hand
an
oil
stove
stands
on
a
pine
box
in
the
centre
of
the
studio
the
artist
rises
tightens
his
waist
belt
to
another
hole
and
lights
the
stove
he
goes
to
a
tin
bread
box
by
a
screen
takes
out
a
solitary
link
of
sausage
turns
the
box
to
show
that
there
is
no
more
and
chucks
the
sausage
into
a
which
he
sets
upon
the
stove
the
flame
of
the
stove
goes
out
showing
that
there
is
no
more
oil
the
artist
in
evident
despair
seizes
the
sausage
in
a
sudden
access
of
rage
and
hurls
it
violently
from
him
at
the
same
time
a
door
opens
and
a
man
who
enters
receives
the
sausage
forcibly
against
his
nose
he
seems
to
cry
out
and
is
observed
to
make
a
dance
step
or
two
vigorously
the
newcomer
is
a
active
man
apparently
of
irish
ancestry
next
he
is
observed
to
laugh
immoderately
he
kicks
over
the
stove
he
claps
the
artist
who
is
vainly
striving
to
grasp
his
hand
vehemently
upon
the
back
then
he
goes
through
a
pantomime
which
to
the
sufficiently
intelligent
spectator
reveals
that
he
has
acquired
large
sums
of
money
by
trading
hatchets
and
razors
to
the
indians
of
the
cordillera
mountains
for
gold
dust
he
draws
a
roll
of
money
as
large
as
a
small
loaf
of
bread
from
his
pocket
and
waves
it
above
his
head
while
at
the
same
time
he
makes
pantomime
of
drinking
from
a
glass
the
artist
hurriedly
secures
his
hat
and
the
two
leave
the
studio
together
the
writing
on
the
sands
scene
beach
at
a
woman
beautiful
still
young
exquisitely
clothed
complacent
poised
reclines
near
the
water
idly
scrawling
letters
in
the
sand
with
the
staff
of
her
silken
parasol
the
beauty
of
her
face
is
audacious
her
languid
pose
is
one
that
you
feel
to
be
impermanent
you
wait
expectant
for
her
to
spring
or
glide
or
crawl
like
a
panther
that
has
unaccountably
become
she
idly
scrawls
in
the
sand
and
the
word
that
she
always
writes
is
isabel
a
man
sits
a
few
yards
away
you
can
see
that
they
are
companions
even
if
no
longer
comrades
his
face
is
dark
and
smooth
and
almost
inscrutable
but
not
quite
the
two
speak
little
together
the
man
also
scratches
on
the
sand
with
his
cane
and
the
word
that
he
writes
is
anchuria
and
then
he
looks
out
where
the
mediterranean
and
the
sky
intermingle
with
death
in
his
gaze
the
wilderness
and
thou
scene
borders
of
a
gentleman
estate
in
a
tropical
an
old
indian
with
a
face
is
trimming
the
grass
on
a
grave
by
a
mangrove
swamp
presently
he
rises
to
his
feet
and
walks
slowly
toward
a
grove
that
is
shaded
by
the
gathering
brief
twilight
in
the
edge
of
the
grove
stand
a
man
who
is
stalwart
with
a
kind
and
courteous
air
and
a
woman
of
a
serene
and
loveliness
when
the
old
indian
comes
up
to
them
the
man
drops
money
in
his
hand
the
with
the
stolid
pride
of
his
race
takes
it
as
his
due
and
goes
his
way
the
two
in
the
edge
of
the
grove
turn
back
along
the
dim
pathway
and
walk
close
close
for
after
all
what
is
the
world
at
its
best
but
a
little
round
field
of
the
moving
pictures
with
two
walking
together
in
it
