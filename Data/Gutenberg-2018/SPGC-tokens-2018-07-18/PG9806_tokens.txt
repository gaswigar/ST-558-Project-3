chapter
i
an
inaugural
banquet
raffles
had
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
town
and
even
i
had
no
conception
of
his
whereabouts
until
he
cabled
to
me
to
meet
the
at
charing
cross
next
night
that
was
on
the
tuesday
before
the
match
or
a
full
fortnight
after
his
mysterious
disappearance
the
telegram
was
from
carlsbad
of
all
places
for
raffles
of
all
men
of
course
there
was
only
one
thing
that
could
possibly
have
taken
so
rare
a
specimen
of
physical
fitness
to
any
such
pernicious
spot
but
to
my
horror
he
emerged
from
the
train
on
the
wednesday
evening
a
cadaverous
caricature
of
the
splendid
person
i
had
gone
to
meet
not
a
word
my
dear
bunny
till
i
have
bitten
british
beef
said
he
in
tones
as
hollow
as
his
cheeks
no
i
not
going
to
stop
to
clear
my
baggage
now
you
can
do
that
for
me
bunny
like
a
dear
good
pal
any
time
you
like
said
i
giving
him
my
arm
but
where
shall
we
dine
kellner
neapolo
the
carlton
or
the
club
but
raffles
shook
his
head
at
one
and
all
i
do
want
to
dine
at
all
he
said
i
know
what
i
want
and
he
led
the
way
from
the
station
stopping
once
to
gloat
over
the
sunset
across
trafalgar
square
and
again
to
inhale
the
tarry
scent
of
the
warm
which
was
perfume
to
his
nostrils
as
the
din
of
its
traffic
was
music
to
his
ears
before
we
came
to
one
of
those
political
palaces
which
permit
themselves
to
be
included
in
the
list
of
ordinary
clubs
raffles
to
my
surprise
walked
in
as
though
the
marble
hall
belonged
to
him
and
as
straight
as
might
be
to
the
where
cooks
were
making
things
hiss
upon
a
silver
grill
he
did
not
consult
me
as
to
what
we
were
to
have
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
that
in
the
train
but
he
chose
the
fillet
steaks
himself
he
insisted
on
seeing
the
kidneys
and
had
a
word
to
say
about
the
fried
potatoes
and
the
welsh
rarebit
that
was
to
follow
and
all
this
was
as
uncharacteristic
of
the
normal
raffles
who
was
least
fastidious
at
the
table
as
the
sigh
with
which
he
dropped
into
the
chair
opposite
mine
and
crossed
his
arms
upon
the
cloth
i
did
know
you
were
a
member
of
this
place
said
i
feeling
really
rather
shocked
at
the
discovery
but
also
that
it
was
a
safer
subject
for
me
to
open
than
that
of
his
late
mysterious
movements
there
are
a
good
many
things
you
do
know
about
me
bunny
said
he
wearily
did
you
know
i
was
in
carlsbad
for
instance
of
course
i
did
yet
you
remember
the
last
time
we
sat
down
together
you
mean
that
night
we
had
supper
at
the
savoy
it
only
three
weeks
ago
bunny
it
seems
months
to
me
and
years
to
me
cried
raffles
but
surely
you
remember
that
lost
tribesman
at
the
next
table
with
the
nose
like
the
village
pump
and
the
wife
with
the
emerald
necklace
i
should
think
i
did
said
i
you
mean
the
great
dan
levy
otherwise
shylock
why
you
told
me
all
about
him
a
j
did
i
then
you
may
possibly
recollect
that
the
shylocks
were
off
to
carlsbad
the
very
next
day
it
was
the
old
man
last
orgy
before
his
annual
cure
and
he
let
the
whole
room
know
it
ah
bunny
i
can
sympathise
with
the
poor
brute
now
but
what
on
earth
took
you
there
old
fellow
can
you
ask
have
you
forgotten
how
you
saw
the
emeralds
under
their
table
when
they
gone
and
how
forgot
myself
and
ran
after
them
with
the
best
necklace
i
handled
since
the
days
of
lady
melrose
i
shook
my
head
partly
in
answer
to
his
question
but
partly
also
over
a
piece
of
perversity
which
still
rankled
in
my
recollection
but
now
i
was
prepared
for
something
even
more
perverse
you
were
quite
right
continued
raffles
recalling
my
recriminations
at
the
time
it
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
it
was
also
the
action
of
a
tactless
idiot
since
anybody
could
have
seen
that
a
heavy
necklace
like
that
could
have
dropped
off
without
the
wearer
knowledge
you
do
mean
to
say
she
dropped
it
on
purpose
i
exclaimed
with
more
interest
for
i
suddenly
foresaw
the
remainder
of
his
tale
i
do
said
raffles
the
poor
old
pet
did
it
deliberately
when
stooping
to
pick
up
something
else
and
all
to
get
it
stolen
and
delay
their
trip
to
carlsbad
where
her
swab
of
a
husband
makes
her
do
the
cure
with
him
i
said
i
always
felt
that
we
had
failed
to
fulfil
an
obvious
destiny
in
the
matter
of
those
emeralds
and
there
was
something
touching
in
the
way
raffles
now
sided
with
me
against
himself
but
i
saw
it
the
moment
i
had
yanked
them
up
said
he
and
heard
that
fat
swine
curse
his
wife
for
dropping
them
he
told
her
she
done
it
on
purpose
too
he
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
all
right
but
it
was
her
poor
head
and
that
showed
me
my
unworthy
impulse
in
its
true
light
bunny
i
did
need
your
reproaches
to
make
me
realise
what
a
skunk
i
been
all
round
i
saw
that
the
necklace
was
morally
yours
and
there
was
one
clear
call
for
me
to
restore
it
to
you
by
hook
crook
or
barrel
i
left
for
carlsbad
as
soon
after
its
wrongful
owners
as
prudence
permitted
admirable
said
i
overjoyed
to
find
old
raffles
by
no
means
in
such
bad
form
as
he
looked
but
not
to
have
taken
me
with
you
the
unkind
cut
i
ca
forgive
my
dear
bunny
you
could
have
borne
it
said
raffles
solemnly
the
cure
would
have
killed
you
look
what
it
done
to
me
do
tell
me
you
went
through
with
it
i
rallied
him
of
course
i
did
bunny
i
played
the
game
like
a
but
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
wanton
you
do
know
carlsbad
or
you
would
ask
the
place
is
squirming
with
spies
and
humbugs
if
i
had
broken
the
rules
one
of
the
prize
humbugs
laid
down
for
me
i
should
have
been
spotted
in
a
tick
by
a
spy
and
bowled
out
myself
for
a
spy
and
a
humbug
rolled
into
one
oh
bunny
if
old
man
dante
were
alive
i
should
commend
him
to
that
sink
of
salubrity
for
the
redraw
material
of
another
and
a
worse
inferno
the
steaks
had
arrived
smoking
hot
with
a
kidney
apiece
and
lashings
of
fried
potatoes
and
for
a
divine
interval
as
it
must
have
been
to
him
raffles
only
words
were
to
the
waiter
and
referred
to
successive
tankards
of
bitter
with
the
superfluous
rider
that
the
man
who
said
we
could
drink
beer
was
a
liar
but
indeed
i
never
could
myself
and
only
achieved
the
impossible
in
this
case
out
of
sheer
sympathy
with
raffles
and
eventually
i
had
my
reward
in
such
a
recital
of
malignant
privation
as
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
set
down
in
any
words
but
his
no
bunny
you
could
have
borne
it
for
half
a
week
you
have
looked
like
that
all
the
time
quoth
raffles
i
suppose
my
face
had
fallen
as
it
does
too
easily
at
his
aspersion
on
my
endurance
cheer
up
my
man
that
better
he
went
on
as
i
did
my
best
but
it
was
no
smiling
matter
out
there
no
one
does
smile
after
the
first
week
your
sense
of
humour
is
the
first
thing
the
cure
eradicates
there
was
a
hunting
man
at
my
hotel
getting
his
weight
down
to
ride
a
special
thoroughbred
and
no
doubt
a
cheery
dog
at
home
but
poor
devil
he
had
much
chance
of
good
cheer
there
miles
and
miles
on
his
poor
feet
before
breakfast
all
the
morning
and
not
the
semblance
of
a
drink
all
day
except
some
aerated
muck
called
giesh√ºbler
he
was
allowed
to
lap
that
up
an
hour
after
meals
when
his
tongue
would
be
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
we
went
to
the
same
weighing
machine
at
and
though
he
looked
quite
once
when
i
caught
him
asleep
in
his
chair
i
have
known
him
tear
up
his
weight
ticket
when
he
had
gained
an
ounce
or
two
instead
of
losing
one
or
two
pounds
we
began
by
taking
our
walks
together
but
his
conversation
used
to
get
so
physically
introspective
that
one
could
get
in
a
word
about
one
own
works
edgeways
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
your
works
i
reminded
raffles
he
shook
his
head
as
one
who
was
not
so
sure
perhaps
not
at
first
but
the
cure
soon
sees
to
that
i
closed
in
like
a
concertina
bunny
and
i
only
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
pull
out
like
one
you
see
it
the
custom
of
the
accursed
place
for
one
to
telephone
for
a
doctor
the
moment
one
arrives
i
consulted
the
hunting
man
who
of
course
recommended
his
own
in
order
to
make
sure
of
a
companion
on
the
rack
the
old
was
down
upon
me
in
ten
minutes
examining
me
from
crown
to
heel
and
made
the
most
unblushing
report
upon
my
general
condition
he
said
i
had
a
liver
i
swear
i
had
before
i
went
to
carlsbad
but
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
i
brought
one
back
and
he
tipped
his
tankard
with
a
solemn
face
before
falling
to
work
upon
the
welsh
rarebit
which
had
just
arrived
it
looks
like
gold
and
it
golden
eating
said
poor
old
raffles
i
only
wish
that
sly
dog
of
a
doctor
could
see
me
at
it
he
had
the
nerve
to
make
me
write
out
my
own
and
it
was
so
like
my
friend
the
hunting
man
that
it
dispelled
his
settled
gloom
for
the
whole
of
that
evening
we
used
to
begin
our
drinking
day
at
the
same
well
of
german
damnably
defiled
and
we
paced
the
same
colonnade
to
the
blare
of
the
same
band
that
was
a
joke
bunny
it
not
a
thing
to
joke
about
and
dry
meals
with
teetotal
poisons
in
between
were
to
be
my
portion
too
you
stiffen
your
lip
at
that
eh
bunny
i
told
you
that
you
never
would
or
could
have
stood
it
but
it
was
the
only
game
to
play
for
the
emerald
stakes
it
kept
one
above
suspicion
all
the
time
and
then
i
did
mind
that
part
as
much
as
you
would
or
as
my
hunting
pal
did
he
was
driven
to
fainting
at
the
doctor
place
one
day
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
a
toothful
of
brandy
to
bring
him
round
but
all
he
got
was
a
glass
of
cheap
marsala
but
did
you
win
those
stakes
after
all
of
course
i
did
bunny
said
raffles
below
his
breath
and
with
a
look
that
i
remembered
later
but
the
waiters
are
listening
as
it
is
and
i
tell
you
the
rest
some
other
time
i
suppose
you
know
what
brought
me
back
so
soon
had
you
finished
your
cure
not
by
three
good
days
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
a
row
royal
with
the
lord
high
humbug
to
account
for
my
hurried
departure
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
teddy
garland
had
got
his
blue
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
should
be
at
carlsbad
still
garland
eton
and
trinity
was
the
cambridge
wicketkeeper
and
one
of
the
many
young
cricketers
who
owed
a
good
deal
to
raffles
they
had
made
friends
in
some
week
and
foregathered
afterward
in
town
where
the
young
fellow
father
had
a
house
at
which
raffles
became
a
constant
guest
i
am
afraid
i
was
a
little
prejudiced
both
against
the
father
a
retired
brewer
whom
i
had
never
met
and
the
son
whom
i
did
meet
once
or
twice
at
the
albany
yet
i
could
quite
understand
the
mutual
attraction
between
raffles
and
this
much
younger
man
indeed
he
was
a
mere
boy
but
like
so
many
of
his
school
he
seemed
to
have
a
knowledge
of
the
world
beyond
his
years
and
withal
such
a
spontaneous
spring
of
sweetness
and
charm
as
neither
knowledge
nor
experience
could
sensibly
pollute
and
yet
i
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
wild
oats
had
been
somewhat
freely
sown
and
that
it
was
raffles
who
had
stepped
in
and
taken
the
sower
in
hand
and
turned
him
into
the
stuff
of
which
blues
are
made
at
least
i
knew
that
no
one
could
be
sounder
friend
or
saner
counsellor
to
any
young
fellow
in
need
of
either
and
many
there
must
be
to
bear
me
out
in
their
hearts
but
they
did
not
know
their
raffles
as
i
knew
mine
and
if
they
say
that
was
why
they
thought
so
much
of
him
let
them
have
patience
and
at
last
they
shall
hear
something
that
need
not
make
them
think
the
less
i
could
let
poor
teddy
keep
at
lord
explained
raffles
and
me
not
there
to
egg
him
on
you
see
bunny
i
taught
him
a
thing
or
two
in
those
little
matches
we
played
together
last
august
i
take
a
fatherly
interest
in
the
child
you
must
have
done
him
a
lot
of
good
i
suggested
in
every
way
raffles
looked
up
from
his
bill
and
asked
me
what
i
meant
i
saw
he
was
not
pleased
with
my
remark
but
i
was
not
going
back
on
it
well
i
should
imagine
you
had
straightened
him
out
a
bit
if
you
ask
me
i
did
ask
you
bunny
that
just
the
point
said
raffles
and
i
watched
him
tip
the
waiter
without
the
least
on
either
side
after
all
said
i
on
our
way
down
the
marble
stair
you
have
told
me
a
good
deal
about
the
lad
i
remember
once
hearing
you
say
he
had
a
lot
of
debts
for
example
so
i
was
afraid
replied
raffles
frankly
and
between
ourselves
i
offered
to
finance
him
before
i
went
abroad
teddy
would
hear
of
it
that
hot
young
blood
of
his
was
up
at
the
thought
though
he
was
perfectly
delightful
in
what
he
said
so
do
jump
to
rotten
conclusions
bunny
but
stroll
up
to
the
albany
and
have
a
drink
and
when
we
had
reclaimed
our
hats
and
coats
and
lit
our
sullivans
in
the
hall
out
we
marched
as
though
i
were
now
of
the
place
with
raffles
that
said
i
to
effect
a
thorough
change
of
conversation
since
i
felt
at
one
with
all
the
world
is
certainly
the
finest
grill
in
europe
that
why
we
went
there
bunny
but
must
i
say
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
you
a
member
of
a
place
where
you
tip
the
waiter
and
take
a
ticket
for
your
hat
i
was
not
surprised
however
to
hear
raffles
defend
his
own
caravanserai
i
would
go
a
step
further
he
remarked
and
make
every
member
show
his
badge
as
they
do
at
lord
but
surely
the
porter
knows
the
members
by
sight
not
he
there
are
far
too
many
thousands
of
them
i
should
have
thought
he
must
and
i
know
he
does
well
you
ought
to
know
since
you
a
member
yourself
on
the
contrary
my
dear
bunny
i
happen
to
know
because
i
never
was
one
chapter
ii
his
own
familiar
friend
how
we
laughed
as
we
turned
into
whitehall
i
began
to
feel
i
had
been
wrong
about
raffles
after
all
and
that
enhanced
my
mirth
surely
this
was
the
old
gay
rascal
and
it
was
by
some
uncanny
feat
of
his
stupendous
will
that
he
had
appeared
so
haggard
on
the
platform
in
the
london
lamplight
that
he
loved
so
well
under
a
starry
sky
of
an
almost
theatrical
blue
he
looked
another
man
already
if
such
a
change
was
due
to
a
few
draughts
of
bitter
beer
and
a
few
ounces
of
fillet
steak
then
i
felt
i
was
the
brewers
friend
and
the
vegetarians
foe
for
life
nevertheless
i
could
detect
a
serious
side
to
my
companion
mood
especially
when
he
spoke
once
more
of
teddy
garland
and
told
me
that
he
had
cabled
to
him
also
before
leaving
carlsbad
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
with
a
discreditable
pang
whether
his
intercourse
with
that
honest
lad
could
have
bred
in
raffles
a
remorse
for
his
own
misdeeds
such
as
i
myself
had
often
tried
but
always
failed
to
produce
so
we
came
to
the
albany
in
sober
frame
for
all
our
recent
levity
thinking
at
least
no
evil
for
once
in
our
lawless
lives
and
there
was
our
good
friend
barraclough
the
porter
to
salute
and
welcome
us
in
the
courtyard
there
a
writing
you
a
letter
upstairs
said
he
to
raffles
it
garland
sir
so
i
took
him
up
teddy
cried
raffles
and
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
i
followed
rather
heavily
it
was
not
jealousy
but
i
did
feel
rather
critical
of
this
mushroom
intimacy
so
i
followed
up
feeling
that
the
evening
was
spoilt
for
me
and
god
knows
i
was
right
not
till
my
dying
day
shall
i
forget
the
tableau
that
awaited
me
in
those
familiar
rooms
i
see
it
now
as
plainly
as
i
see
the
problem
picture
of
the
year
which
lies
in
wait
for
one
in
all
the
illustrated
papers
indeed
it
was
a
problem
picture
itself
in
flesh
and
blood
raffles
had
opened
his
door
as
only
raffles
could
open
doors
with
the
boyish
thought
of
giving
the
other
boy
a
fright
and
young
garland
had
very
naturally
started
up
from
the
bureau
where
he
was
writing
at
the
sudden
clap
of
his
own
name
behind
him
but
that
was
the
last
of
his
natural
actions
he
did
not
advance
to
grasp
raffles
by
the
hand
there
was
no
answering
smile
of
welcome
on
the
fresh
young
face
which
used
to
remind
me
of
the
phoebus
in
guido
aurora
with
its
healthy
pink
and
bronze
and
its
hazel
eye
like
clear
amber
the
pink
faded
before
our
gaze
the
bronze
turned
a
sickly
sallow
and
there
stood
teddy
garland
as
if
glued
to
the
bureau
behind
him
clutching
its
edge
with
all
his
might
i
can
see
his
knuckles
gleaming
like
ivory
under
the
back
of
each
sunburnt
hand
what
is
it
what
are
you
hiding
demanded
raffles
his
love
for
the
lad
had
rung
out
in
his
first
greeting
his
puzzled
voice
was
still
jocular
and
genial
but
the
other
attitude
soon
strangled
that
all
this
time
i
had
been
standing
in
vague
horror
on
the
threshold
now
raffles
beckoned
me
in
and
switched
on
more
light
it
fell
full
upon
a
ghastly
and
a
guilty
face
that
yet
stared
bravely
in
the
glare
raffles
locked
the
door
behind
us
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
strode
over
to
the
desk
no
need
to
report
their
first
broken
syllables
enough
that
it
was
no
note
young
garland
was
writing
but
a
cheque
which
he
was
laboriously
copying
into
raffles
from
an
old
cheque
abstracted
from
a
with
raffles
in
gilt
capitals
upon
its
brown
leather
back
raffles
had
only
that
year
opened
a
banking
account
and
i
remembered
his
telling
me
how
thoroughly
he
meant
to
disregard
the
instructions
on
his
by
always
leaving
it
about
to
advertise
the
fact
and
this
was
the
result
a
glance
convicted
his
friend
of
criminal
intent
a
sheet
of
notepaper
lay
covered
with
trial
signatures
yet
raffles
could
turn
and
look
with
infinite
pity
upon
the
miserable
youth
who
was
still
looking
defiantly
on
him
my
poor
chap
was
all
he
said
and
at
that
the
broken
boy
found
the
tongue
of
a
hoarse
and
quavering
old
man
wo
you
hand
me
over
and
be
done
with
it
he
croaked
must
you
torture
me
yourself
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
refrain
from
putting
in
my
word
and
telling
the
fellow
it
was
not
for
him
to
ask
questions
raffles
merely
inquired
whether
he
had
thought
it
all
out
before
god
knows
i
had
i
came
up
to
write
you
a
note
i
swear
i
did
said
garland
with
a
sudden
sob
no
need
to
swear
it
returned
raffles
actually
smiling
your
quite
good
enough
for
me
god
bless
you
for
that
after
this
the
other
choked
in
terrible
disorder
now
it
was
pretty
obvious
said
raffles
reassuringly
was
it
are
you
sure
you
do
remember
offering
me
a
cheque
last
month
and
my
refusing
it
why
of
course
i
do
cried
raffles
with
such
spontaneous
heartiness
that
i
could
see
he
had
never
thought
of
it
since
mentioning
the
matter
to
me
at
our
meal
what
i
could
not
see
was
any
reason
for
such
conspicuous
relief
or
the
extenuating
quality
of
a
circumstance
which
seemed
to
me
rather
to
aggravate
the
offence
i
have
regretted
that
refusal
ever
since
young
garland
continued
very
simply
it
was
a
mistake
at
the
time
but
this
week
of
all
weeks
been
a
tragedy
money
i
must
have
i
tell
you
why
directly
when
i
got
your
wire
last
night
it
seemed
as
though
my
wretched
prayers
had
been
answered
i
was
going
to
someone
else
this
morning
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
wait
for
you
instead
you
were
the
one
i
really
could
turn
to
and
yet
i
refused
your
great
offer
a
month
ago
but
you
said
you
would
be
back
and
you
were
here
when
i
came
i
telephoned
and
found
that
the
train
had
come
in
all
right
and
that
there
was
another
until
the
morning
tomorrow
morning
my
limit
and
the
match
he
stopped
as
he
saw
what
raffles
was
doing
do
raffles
i
deserve
it
he
added
in
fresh
distress
but
raffles
had
unlocked
the
tantalus
and
found
a
syphon
in
the
corner
cupboard
and
it
was
a
very
yellow
bumper
that
he
handed
to
the
guilty
youth
drink
some
he
said
or
i
wo
listen
to
another
word
i
going
to
be
ruined
before
the
match
begins
i
am
the
poor
fellow
insisted
turning
to
me
when
raffles
shook
his
head
and
it
break
my
father
heart
and
and
i
thought
he
had
worse
still
to
tell
us
he
broke
off
in
such
despair
but
either
he
changed
his
mind
or
the
current
of
his
thoughts
set
inward
in
spite
of
him
for
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
to
offer
us
both
a
further
explanation
of
his
conduct
i
only
came
up
to
leave
a
line
for
raffles
he
said
to
me
in
case
he
did
get
back
in
time
it
was
the
porter
himself
who
fixed
me
up
at
that
bureau
he
tell
you
how
many
times
i
had
called
before
and
then
i
saw
before
my
nose
in
one
your
raffles
and
your
bulging
with
old
cheques
and
as
i
was
back
to
write
one
for
you
said
raffles
you
wrote
it
for
me
and
quite
right
too
do
laugh
at
me
cried
the
boy
his
lost
colour
rushing
back
and
he
looked
at
me
again
as
though
my
long
face
hurt
him
less
than
the
sprightly
sympathy
of
his
friend
i
not
laughing
teddy
replied
raffles
kindly
i
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
it
was
playing
the
friend
to
come
to
me
at
all
in
your
fix
but
it
was
the
act
of
a
real
good
pal
to
draw
on
me
behind
my
back
rather
than
let
me
feel
i
ruined
you
by
not
turning
up
in
time
you
may
shake
your
head
as
hard
as
you
like
but
i
never
was
paid
a
higher
compliment
and
the
consummate
casuist
went
on
working
a
congenial
vein
until
a
less
miserable
sinner
might
have
been
persuaded
that
he
had
done
nothing
really
dishonourable
but
young
garland
had
the
grace
neither
to
make
nor
to
accept
any
excuse
for
his
own
conduct
i
never
heard
a
man
more
down
upon
himself
or
confession
of
error
couched
in
stronger
terms
and
yet
there
was
something
so
sincere
and
ingenuous
in
his
remorse
something
that
raffles
and
i
had
lost
so
long
ago
that
in
our
hearts
i
am
sure
we
took
his
follies
more
seriously
than
our
own
crimes
but
foolish
he
indeed
had
been
if
not
criminally
foolish
as
he
said
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
prodigal
son
of
an
indulgent
father
there
had
been
as
i
suspected
a
certain
amount
of
youthful
riot
which
the
influence
of
raffles
had
already
quelled
but
there
had
also
been
much
reckless
extravagance
of
which
raffles
naturally
knew
less
since
your
scapegrace
is
constitutionally
quicker
to
confess
himself
as
such
than
as
a
fool
suffice
it
that
this
one
had
thrown
himself
on
his
father
generosity
only
to
find
that
the
father
himself
was
in
financial
straits
what
cried
raffles
with
that
house
on
his
hands
i
knew
it
would
surprise
you
said
teddy
garland
i
ca
understand
it
myself
he
gave
me
no
particulars
but
the
mere
fact
was
enough
for
me
i
simply
could
tell
my
father
everything
after
that
he
wrote
me
a
cheque
for
all
i
did
own
up
to
but
i
could
see
it
was
such
a
tooth
that
i
swore
i
never
come
on
him
to
pay
another
farthing
and
i
never
will
the
boy
took
a
sip
from
his
glass
for
his
voice
had
faltered
and
then
he
paused
to
light
another
cigarette
because
the
last
had
gone
out
between
his
fingers
so
sensitive
and
yet
so
desperate
was
the
blonde
young
face
with
the
creased
forehead
and
the
nervous
mouth
that
i
saw
raffles
look
another
way
until
the
match
was
blown
out
but
at
the
time
i
might
have
done
worse
and
did
said
teddy
a
thousand
times
i
went
to
the
jews
that
the
whole
trouble
there
were
more
debts
debts
of
honour
and
to
square
up
i
went
to
the
jews
it
was
only
a
matter
of
two
or
three
hundred
to
start
with
but
you
may
know
though
i
did
what
a
snowball
the
smallest
sum
becomes
in
the
hands
of
those
devils
i
borrowed
three
hundred
and
signed
a
promissory
note
for
four
hundred
and
only
fifty
per
cent
said
raffles
you
got
off
cheap
if
the
percentage
was
per
annum
wait
a
bit
it
was
by
way
of
being
even
more
reasonable
than
that
the
four
hundred
and
was
repayable
in
monthly
instalments
of
twenty
quid
and
i
kept
them
up
religiously
until
the
sixth
payment
fell
due
that
was
soon
after
christmas
when
one
always
hard
up
and
for
the
first
time
i
was
a
day
or
two
late
not
more
mind
you
yet
what
do
you
suppose
happened
my
cheque
was
returned
and
the
whole
blessed
balance
demanded
on
the
nail
raffles
was
following
intently
with
that
complete
concentration
which
was
a
signal
force
in
his
equipment
his
face
no
longer
changed
at
anything
he
heard
it
was
as
strenuously
attentive
as
that
of
any
judge
upon
the
bench
never
had
i
clearer
vision
of
the
man
he
might
have
been
but
for
the
kink
in
his
nature
which
had
made
him
what
he
was
the
promissory
note
was
for
said
he
and
this
sudden
demand
was
for
the
lot
less
the
hundred
you
had
paid
that
it
what
did
you
do
i
asked
not
to
seem
behind
raffles
in
my
grasp
of
the
case
told
them
to
take
my
instalment
or
go
to
blazes
for
the
rest
and
they
absolutely
drop
the
whole
thing
until
this
very
week
and
then
come
down
on
me
for
what
do
you
suppose
getting
on
for
a
thousand
said
raffles
after
a
moment
thought
nonsense
i
cried
garland
looked
astonished
too
raffles
knows
all
about
it
said
he
seven
hundred
was
the
actual
figure
i
need
tell
you
i
have
given
the
bounders
a
wide
berth
since
the
day
i
raised
the
wind
but
i
went
and
had
it
out
with
them
over
this
and
half
the
seven
hundred
is
for
default
interest
i
trouble
you
from
the
beginning
of
january
down
to
date
had
you
agreed
to
that
not
to
my
recollection
but
there
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
on
my
promissory
note
a
halfpenny
in
the
shilling
per
week
over
and
above
everything
else
when
the
original
interest
was
forthcoming
printed
or
written
on
your
note
of
hand
printed
printed
small
i
need
tell
you
but
quite
large
enough
for
me
to
read
when
i
signed
the
cursed
bond
in
fact
i
believe
i
did
read
it
but
a
halfpenny
a
week
who
could
ever
believe
it
would
mount
up
like
that
but
it
does
it
right
enough
and
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
unless
i
pay
up
by
twelve
the
governor
to
be
called
in
to
say
whether
he
pay
up
for
me
or
see
me
made
a
bankrupt
under
his
nose
twelve
when
the
match
begins
of
course
they
know
that
and
are
trading
on
it
only
this
evening
i
had
the
most
insolent
ultimatum
saying
it
was
my
and
last
chance
so
then
you
came
round
here
i
was
coming
in
any
case
i
wish
i
shot
myself
first
my
dear
fellow
it
was
doing
me
proud
do
let
us
lose
our
sense
of
proportion
teddy
but
young
garland
had
his
face
upon
his
hand
and
once
more
he
was
the
miserable
man
who
had
begun
brokenly
to
unfold
the
history
of
his
shame
the
unconscious
animation
produced
by
the
mere
unloading
of
his
heart
the
natural
boyish
slang
with
which
his
tale
had
been
freely
garnished
had
faded
from
his
face
had
died
upon
his
lips
once
more
he
was
a
soul
in
torments
of
despair
and
degradation
and
yet
once
more
did
the
absence
of
the
abject
in
man
and
manner
redeem
him
from
the
depths
of
either
in
these
moments
of
reaction
he
was
pitiful
but
not
contemptible
much
less
unlovable
indeed
i
could
see
the
qualities
that
had
won
the
heart
of
raffles
as
i
had
never
seen
them
before
there
is
a
native
nobility
not
to
be
destroyed
by
a
single
descent
into
the
ignoble
an
essential
honesty
too
bright
and
brilliant
to
be
dimmed
by
incidental
dishonour
and
both
remained
to
the
younger
man
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
two
who
were
even
then
determining
to
preserve
in
him
all
that
they
themselves
had
lost
the
thought
came
naturally
enough
to
me
and
yet
i
may
well
have
derived
it
from
a
face
that
for
once
was
easy
to
read
a
face
that
had
never
looked
so
sharp
in
profile
or
to
my
knowledge
half
so
gentle
in
expression
and
what
about
these
jews
asked
raffles
at
length
there
really
only
one
are
we
to
guess
his
name
no
i
do
mind
telling
you
it
dan
levy
of
course
it
is
cried
raffles
with
a
nod
for
me
our
shylock
in
all
his
glory
teddy
snatched
his
face
from
his
hands
you
do
know
him
do
you
i
might
almost
say
i
know
him
at
home
said
raffles
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
met
him
abroad
teddy
was
on
his
feet
but
do
you
know
him
well
enough
certainly
i
see
him
in
the
morning
but
i
ought
to
have
the
receipts
for
the
various
instalments
you
have
paid
and
perhaps
that
letter
saying
it
was
your
last
chance
here
they
all
are
said
garland
producing
a
bulky
envelope
but
of
course

old
ruffian

dear
old
man

dear
young
man

or

to
bed
do
i
bunny
i
seldom
seen
you
there
said
i
but
you
were
travelling
all
last
night
and
straight
through
till
this
evening
and
i
sleep
all
the
time
in
a
train
said
raffles
i
hardly
opened
an
eye
all
day
if
i
turned
in
i
should
get
a
wink
well
i
sha
either
said
the
other
hopelessly
i
forgotten
how
to
sleep
wait
till
i
learn
you
said
raffles
and
went
into
the
inner
room
and
lit
it
up
i
terribly
sorry
about
it
all
whispered
young
garland
turning
to
me
as
though
we
were
old
friends
now
and
i
sorry
for
you
said
i
from
my
heart
i
know
what
it
is
garland
was
still
staring
when
raffles
returned
with
a
tiny
bottle
from
which
he
was
shaking
little
round
black
things
into
his
left
palm
clean
sheets
yawning
for
you
teddy
said
he
and
now
take
two
of
these
and
one
more
spot
of
whisky
and
you
be
asleep
in
ten
minutes
what
are
they
somnol
the
latest
thing
out
and
quite
the
best
but
wo
they
give
me
a
frightful
head
not
a
bit
of
it
you
be
as
right
as
rain
ten
minutes
after
you
wake
up
and
you
need
leave
this
before
eleven
morning
because
you
do
want
a
knock
at
the
nets
do
you
i
ought
to
have
one
said
teddy
seriously
but
raffles
laughed
him
to
scorn
they
not
playing
you
for
runs
my
man
and
i
should
run
any
risks
with
those
hands
remember
all
the
chances
they
going
to
lap
up
and
all
the
byes
they
not
got
to
let
and
raffles
had
administered
his
opiate
before
the
patient
knew
much
more
about
it
next
minute
he
was
shaking
hands
with
me
and
the
minute
after
that
raffles
went
in
to
put
out
his
light
he
was
gone
some
little
time
and
i
remember
leaning
out
of
the
window
in
order
not
to
overhear
the
conversation
in
the
next
room
the
night
was
nearly
as
fine
as
ever
the
starry
ceiling
over
the
albany
courtyard
was
only
less
beautifully
blue
than
when
raffles
and
i
had
come
in
a
couple
of
hours
ago
the
traffic
in
piccadilly
came
as
crisply
to
the
ear
as
on
a
winter
night
of
hard
frost
it
was
a
night
of
wine
and
sparkling
wine
and
the
day
at
must
surely
be
a
day
of
nectar
i
could
not
help
wondering
whether
any
man
had
ever
played
in
the
university
match
with
such
a
load
upon
his
soul
as
garland
was
taking
to
his
forced
slumbers
and
then
whether
any
soul
had
ever
hit
upon
two
such
brother
confessors
as
raffles
and
myself
chapter
iii
council
of
war
raffles
was
humming
a
snatch
of
something
too
choice
for
me
to
recognise
when
i
drew
in
my
head
from
the
glorious
night
the
were
shut
and
the
grandfather
clock
on
one
side
of
them
made
it
almost
midnight
raffles
would
not
stop
his
tune
for
me
but
he
pointed
to
the
syphon
and
decanter
and
i
replenished
my
glass
he
had
a
glass
beside
him
also
which
was
less
usual
but
he
did
not
sit
down
beside
his
glass
he
was
far
too
fidgety
for
that
even
bothering
about
a
pair
of
pictures
which
had
changed
places
under
some
zealous
hand
in
his
absence
or
rather
two
of
hollyer
fine
renderings
of
watts
and
of
which
i
had
never
seen
raffles
take
the
slightest
notice
before
but
it
seemed
that
they
must
hang
where
he
had
hung
them
and
for
once
i
saw
them
hanging
straight
the
books
had
also
suffered
from
good
intentions
he
gave
them
up
with
a
shrug
archives
and
arcana
he
tested
or
examined
and
so
a
good
many
minutes
passed
without
a
word
but
when
he
stole
back
into
the
inner
room
after
waiting
a
little
at
the
there
was
still
some
faint
strain
upon
his
lips
it
was
only
when
he
returned
shutting
the
door
none
too
quietly
behind
him
that
he
stopped
humming
and
spoke
out
with
a
grimmer
face
than
he
had
worn
all
night
that
boy
in
a
bigger
hole
than
he
thinks
but
we
must
pull
him
out
between
us
before
play
begins
it
one
clear
call
for
us
bunny
is
it
a
bigger
hole
than
you
thought
i
asked
thinking
myself
of
the
conversation
which
i
had
managed
not
to
overhear
i
do
say
that
bunny
though
i
never
should
have
dreamt
of
his
old
father
being
in
one
too
i
own
i
ca
understand
that
they
live
in
a
regular
country
house
in
the
middle
of
kensington
and
there
are
only
the
two
of
them
but
i
given
teddy
my
word
not
to
go
to
the
old
man
for
the
money
so
it
no
use
talking
about
it
but
apparently
it
was
what
they
had
been
talking
about
behind
the
it
only
surprised
me
to
see
how
much
raffles
took
it
to
heart
so
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
raise
the
money
elsewhere
before
that
lad
in
there
opens
his
eyes
is
he
asleep
already
like
the
dead
said
raffles
dropping
into
his
chair
and
drinking
thoughtfully
and
so
he
will
be
till
we
wake
him
up
it
a
ticklish
experiment
bunny
but
even
a
splitting
head
for
the
first
hour
play
is
better
than
a
sleepless
night
i
tried
both
so
i
ought
to
know
i
should
even
wonder
if
he
did
himself
more
than
justice
one
often
does
when
just
less
than
fit
it
takes
off
that
dangerous
edge
of
which
so
often
cuts
one
own
throat
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
not
so
much
worse
than
i
let
him
think
i
thought
but
you
must
have
been
amazed
i
am
past
amazement
at
the
worst
thing
the
best
of
us
ever
does
and
contrariwise
of
course
your
rich
man
proves
a
pauper
and
your
honest
man
plays
the
knave
we
all
of
us
capable
of
every
damned
thing
but
let
us
thank
our
stars
and
teddy
that
we
got
back
just
when
we
did
why
at
that
moment
raffles
produced
the
unfinished
cheque
shook
his
head
over
it
and
sent
it
fluttering
across
to
me
was
there
ever
such
a
childish
attempt
they
have
kept
him
in
the
bank
while
they
sent
for
the
police
if
ever
you
want
to
play
this
game
bunny
you
must
let
me
coach
you
up
a
bit
but
it
was
never
one
of
your
games
only
incidentally
once
or
twice
it
never
appealed
to
me
said
raffles
sending
expanding
circlets
of
smoke
to
crown
the
girls
on
the
golden
stair
that
was
no
longer
tilted
in
a
leaning
tower
no
bunny
an
occasional
at
school
is
my
modest
record
as
a
forger
though
i
admit
that
augured
do
you
remember
how
i
left
my
about
on
purpose
for
what
happened
to
be
sinned
against
instead
of
sinning
in
all
the
papers
would
have
set
one
up
as
an
honest
man
for
life
i
thought
god
forgive
me
of
poor
old
barraclough
or
somebody
of
that
kind
and
to
think
it
should
be
friend
in
whom
my
soul
confided
not
that
i
ever
did
confide
in
him
bunny
much
as
i
love
this
lad
despite
the
tense
of
that
last
statement
it
was
the
old
raffles
who
was
speaking
now
the
incisively
cynical
old
raffles
that
i
still
knew
the
best
the
raffles
of
the
impudent
quotations
and
jaunty
this
raffles
only
meant
half
he
said
but
had
generally
done
the
other
half
i
met
his
mood
by
reminding
him
out
of
his
own
that
the
sun
rose
at
in
case
he
thought
of
breaking
in
anywhere
that
night
i
had
the
honour
of
making
raffles
smile
i
did
think
of
it
bunny
said
he
but
there
only
one
crib
that
we
could
crack
in
decency
for
this
money
and
our
shylock
is
not
the
sort
of
city
that
caesar
himself
would
have
taken
it
a
case
for
the
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
must
remember
that
i
been
there
bunny
at
least
i
visited
his
tent
if
one
may
jump
from
an
ancient
to
an
and
modern
and
if
that
was
as
impregnable
as
i
found
it
his
permanent
citadel
must
be
perched
upon
the
very
rock
of
defence
you
must
tell
me
about
that
raffles
said
i
tiring
a
little
of
his
kaleidoscopic
metaphors
let
him
be
as
allusive
as
he
liked
when
there
was
no
risky
work
on
hand
and
i
was
his
lucky
and
delighted
audience
till
all
hours
of
the
night
or
morning
but
for
a
deed
of
darkness
i
wanted
fewer
fireworks
a
steadier
light
from
his
intellectual
lantern
and
yet
these
were
the
very
moments
that
inspired
his
pyrotechnic
displays
oh
i
shall
tell
you
all
right
said
raffles
but
just
now
the
next
few
hours
are
of
more
importance
than
the
last
few
weeks
of
course
shylock
the
man
for
our
money
but
knowing
our
tribesmen
as
i
do
i
think
we
had
better
begin
by
borrowing
it
like
simple
christians
then
we
have
it
to
pay
back
again
and
that
the
psychological
moment
for
raiding
our
sunless
coffers
if
he
happens
to
have
any
it
will
give
us
time
to
find
out
but
he
does
keep
open
office
all
night
i
objected
but
he
opens
at
nine
in
the
morning
said
raffles
to
catch
the
early
stockbroker
who
would
rather
be
bled
than
hammered
who
told
you
that
our
mrs
shylock
you
must
have
made
great
friends
with
her
more
in
pity
than
for
the
sake
of
secrets
but
you
went
where
the
secrets
were
and
she
gave
them
away
wholesale
she
would
i
said
to
you
she
told
me
a
lot
about
the
impending
libel
action
shylock
fact
yes
it
coming
on
before
the
vacation
you
know
so
i
saw
in
some
paper
but
you
know
what
it
all
about
bunny
no
i
do
another
old
rascal
the
maharajah
of
hathipur
and
his
perfectly
fabulous
debts
it
seems
he
been
in
our
shylock
clutches
for
years
but
instead
of
taking
his
pound
of
flesh
he
always
increasing
the
amount
of
course
that
the
whole
duty
of
but
now
they
say
the
figure
runs
well
into
six
no
one
has
any
sympathy
with
that
old
heathen
he
said
to
have
been
a
pal
of
nana
before
the
mutiny
and
in
it
up
to
the
neck
he
only
saved
by
turning
against
his
own
lot
in
time
in
any
case
it
the
pot
and
the
kettle
so
far
as
moral
colour
is
concerned
but
i
believe
it
an
actual
fact
that
syndicates
have
been
formed
to
buy
up
the
black
man
debts
and
take
a
reasonable
interest
only
the
dirty
white
man
always
gets
to
windward
of
the
syndicate
they
on
the
point
of
bringing
it
off
when
old
levy
inveigles
the
nigger
into
some
new
oriental
extravagance
has
exposed
the
whole
thing
and
printed
blackmailing
letters
which
shylock
swears
are
forgeries
that
both
their
cases
in
a
philippine
the
leeches
told
the
jew
he
must
do
his
carlsbad
this
year
before
the
case
came
on
and
the
tremendous
amount
it
going
to
cost
may
account
for
his
dunning
old
clients
the
moment
he
gets
back
then
why
should
he
lend
to
you
i
a
new
client
bunny
that
makes
all
the
difference
then
we
were
very
good
pals
out
there
but
you
and
shylock
were
better
still
unbeknowns
bunny
she
used
to
tell
me
her
troubles
when
i
lent
her
an
arm
and
took
due
care
to
look
a
martyr
my
hunting
friend
had
coarse
metaphors
about
and
the
knacker
yard
and
yet
you
came
away
with
the
poor
soul
necklace
raffles
was
tapping
the
chronic
cigarette
on
the
table
at
his
elbow
he
stood
up
to
light
it
as
one
does
stand
up
to
make
the
dramatic
announcements
of
one
life
and
he
spoke
through
the
flame
of
the
match
as
it
rose
and
fell
between
his
puffs
no
bunny
i
did
not
but
you
told
me
you
won
the
emerald
stakes
i
cried
jumping
up
in
my
turn
so
i
did
bunny
but
i
gave
them
back
again
you
gave
yourself
away
to
her
as
she
given
him
away
to
you
do
be
a
fool
bunny
said
raffles
subsiding
into
his
chair
i
ca
tell
you
the
whole
thing
now
but
here
are
the
main
heads
at
the
savoy
hotel
in
carlsbad
i
mean
i
go
to
pupp
we
meet
they
stare
i
come
out
of
my
british
shell
as
the
humble
hero
of
the
affair
at
the
other
savoy
i
crab
my
hotel
they
swear
by
theirs
i
go
to
see
their
rooms
i
wait
till
i
can
get
the
very
same
thing
immediately
overhead
on
the
second
floor
where
i
can
even
hear
the
old
swine
cursing
her
from
under
his
both
suites
have
balconies
that
might
have
been
made
for
me
need
i
go
on
i
wonder
you
were
suspected
there
no
end
to
your
capacity
for
wonder
bunny
i
took
some
sweet
old
rags
with
me
on
purpose
carefully
packed
inside
a
decent
suit
and
i
had
the
luck
to
pick
up
a
foul
old
german
cap
that
some
peasant
had
cast
off
in
the
woods
i
only
meant
to
leave
it
on
them
like
a
card
as
it
was
well
i
was
waiting
for
the
best
barber
in
the
place
to
open
his
shop
next
morning
what
had
happened
a
whole
actful
of
unrehearsed
effects
that
why
i
think
twice
before
taking
on
old
shylock
again
i
admire
him
bunny
as
a
steely
foeman
i
look
forward
to
another
game
with
him
on
his
own
ground
but
i
must
find
out
the
pace
of
the
wicket
before
i
put
myself
on
i
suppose
you
had
tea
with
them
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
giesh√ºbler
said
raffles
with
a
shudder
but
i
made
it
last
as
long
as
tea
and
thought
i
had
located
the
little
green
lamps
before
i
took
my
leave
there
was
a
japanned
despatch
box
in
one
corner
the
emerald
isle
i
thought
soon
have
it
out
of
the
sea
the
old
man
wo
trust
to
the
old
lady
after
what
happened
in
town
i
tell
you
i
knew
they
were
there
somewhere
he
made
her
wear
them
even
at
the
tragic
travesty
of
a
carlsbad
hotel
dinner
raffles
was
forgetting
to
be
laconic
now
i
believe
he
had
forgotten
the
lad
in
the
next
room
and
everything
else
but
the
breathless
battle
that
he
was
fighting
over
again
for
my
benefit
he
told
me
how
he
waited
for
a
dark
night
and
then
slid
down
from
his
balcony
to
the
one
below
and
my
emeralds
were
not
in
the
japanned
box
after
all
and
just
as
he
had
assured
himself
of
the
fact
the
opened
as
it
might
be
these
and
there
stood
dan
levy
in
a
suit
of
swagger
silk
pyjamas
they
gave
me
a
sudden
respect
for
him
continued
raffles
it
struck
me
for
the
first
time
that
mud
baths
might
be
the
only
ones
he
ever
took
his
face
was
as
evil
as
ever
but
he
was
utterly
unarmed
and
i
was
not
and
yet
there
he
stood
and
abused
me
like
a
pickpocket
as
if
there
was
no
chance
of
my
firing
and
he
did
care
whether
i
did
or
not
so
i
stuck
my
revolver
nearly
in
his
face
and
pulled
the
hammer
up
and
up
good
god
bunny
if
i
had
pulled
too
hard
but
that
made
him
blink
a
bit
and
i
was
jolly
glad
to
let
it
down
again
with
those
emeralds
says
i
in
low
german
mugged
up
in
case
of
need
of
course
you
realise
that
i
was
absolutely
unrecognisable
a
low
blackguard
with
a
blackened
face
do
know
what
you
mean
says
he
i
damned
if
i
care
says
i
which
means
the
necklace
to
hell
says
he
but
i
struck
myself
and
shook
my
head
and
then
my
fist
at
him
and
nodded
he
laughed
in
my
face
and
upon
my
soul
we
were
at
a
deadlock
so
i
pointed
to
the
clock
and
held
up
one
finger
one
minute
to
live
old
girl
says
he
through
the
doors
this
rotter
has
the
guts
to
shoot
and
i
do
think
he
has
why
the
hell
do
you
get
out
the
other
way
and
alarm
the
and
that
raised
the
siege
bunny
in
comes
the
old
woman
as
plucky
as
he
was
and
shoves
the
necklace
into
my
left
hand
i
longed
to
refuse
it
i
did
dare
and
the
old
beast
took
her
and
shook
her
like
a
rat
until
i
covered
him
again
and
swore
in
german
that
if
he
showed
himself
on
the
balcony
for
the
next
two
minutes
he
be
toter
that
was
the
other
bit
i
got
off
pat
it
was
meant
to
mean
dead
englishman
and
i
left
the
fine
old
girl
clinging
on
to
him
instead
of
him
to
her
i
emptied
my
lungs
and
my
glass
too
raffles
took
a
sip
himself
but
the
rope
was
fixed
to
balcony
but
i
began
by
fixing
the
other
end
to
theirs
and
the
moment
i
was
safely
up
i
undid
my
end
and
dropped
it
clear
to
the
ground
they
found
it
dangling
all
right
when
out
they
rushed
together
of
course
i
picked
the
right
ball
in
the
way
of
nights
it
was
as
well
as
and
in
five
minutes
i
was
helping
the
rest
of
the
hotel
to
search
for
impossible
footprints
on
the
gravel
and
to
stamp
out
any
there
might
conceivably
have
been
so
nobody
ever
suspected
you
not
a
soul
i
can
safely
say
i
was
the
first
my
victims
bored
with
the
whole
yarn
then
why
return
the
swag
it
an
old
trick
of
yours
raffles
but
in
a
case
like
this
with
a
pig
like
that
i
confess
i
do
see
the
point
you
forget
the
poor
old
lady
bunny
she
had
a
dog
life
before
after
that
the
beans
he
gave
her
were
even
fit
for
a
dog
i
loved
her
for
her
pluck
in
standing
up
to
him
it
beat
his
hollow
in
standing
up
to
me
there
was
only
one
reward
for
her
and
it
was
in
my
gift
but
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
that
not
by
public
presentation
bunny
nor
yet
by
taking
the
old
dame
into
my
confidence
cuniculi
i
suppose
you
returned
the
necklace
anonymously
as
a
german
burglar
would
be
sure
to
do
no
bunny
i
planted
it
in
the
woods
where
i
knew
it
would
be
found
and
then
i
had
to
watch
lest
it
was
found
by
the
wrong
sort
but
luckily
shylock
had
sprung
a
substantial
reward
and
all
came
right
in
the
end
he
sent
his
doctor
to
blazes
and
had
a
buck
feed
and
lashings
on
the
night
it
was
recovered
the
hunting
man
and
i
were
invited
to
the
thanksgiving
spread
but
i
would
budge
from
the
diet
and
he
was
ashamed
to
unless
i
did
it
made
a
coolness
between
us
and
now
i
doubt
if
we
shall
ever
have
that
enormous
dinner
we
used
to
talk
about
to
celebrate
our
return
from
a
living
tomb
but
i
was
not
interested
in
that
shadowy
dan
levy
a
formidable
brute
to
tackle
said
i
at
length
and
none
too
buoyantly
that
a
very
true
observation
bunny
it
also
exactly
why
i
so
looked
forward
to
tackling
him
it
ought
to
be
the
kind
of
conflict
that
the
halfpenny
press
have
learnt
to
call
homeric
are
you
thinking
of
or
of
when
it
comes
to
robbing
peter
to
pay
peter
excellent
bunny
cried
raffles
as
though
i
had
made
a
shot
worthy
of
his
willow
how
the
small
hours
brighten
us
up
he
drew
the
curtains
and
displayed
a
window
like
a
child
slate
with
the
sashes
ruled
across
it
you
perceive
how
we
have
tired
the
stars
with
talking
and
cleaned
them
from
the
sky
the
mellifluous
heraclitus
can
have
been
no
sitter
up
o
nights
or
his
pal
would
have
boasted
about
tiring
the
sun
by
our
methods
what
a
lot
the
two
old
pets
must
have
missed
you
have
answered
my
question
said
i
resignedly
nor
have
you
told
me
how
you
propose
to
go
to
work
to
raise
this
money
in
the
first
instance
if
you
like
to
light
another
sullivan
said
raffles
and
mix
yourself
another
very
small
and
final
one
i
can
tell
you
now
bunny
and
tell
me
he
did
chapter
iv
our
shylock
i
have
often
wondered
in
what
pause
or
phase
of
our
conversation
raffles
hit
upon
the
plan
which
we
duly
carried
out
for
we
had
been
talking
incessantly
since
his
arrival
about
eight
at
night
until
two
in
the
morning
yet
that
which
we
discussed
between
two
and
three
was
what
we
actually
did
between
nine
and
ten
with
the
single
exception
necessitated
by
an
altogether
unforeseen
development
of
which
the
less
said
the
better
until
the
proper
time
the
foresight
and
imagination
of
a
raffles
are
obviously
apt
to
outstrip
his
spoken
words
but
even
in
the
course
of
speech
his
ideas
would
crystallise
quite
palpably
to
the
listener
and
the
sentence
that
began
by
throwing
out
a
shadowy
idea
would
culminate
in
a
definite
project
as
the
image
comes
into
focus
under
the
lens
and
with
as
much
detail
into
the
bargain
suffice
it
that
after
a
long
night
of
it
at
the
albany
and
but
a
bath
and
a
cup
of
tea
at
my
own
flat
i
found
raffles
waiting
for
me
in
piccadilly
and
down
we
went
together
to
the
jaws
of
jermyn
street
there
we
nodded
and
i
was
proceeding
down
the
hill
when
i
turned
on
my
heel
as
though
i
had
forgotten
something
and
entered
jermyn
street
not
fifty
yards
behind
raffles
i
had
no
thought
of
catching
him
up
but
it
so
happened
that
i
was
in
his
wake
in
time
to
witness
a
first
which
did
not
amount
to
much
at
the
time
this
was
merely
the
violent
exit
of
another
of
dan
levy
early
callers
into
the
very
arms
of
raffles
there
was
a
heated
apology
accepted
with
courteous
composure
and
followed
by
an
excited
outpouring
which
i
did
not
come
near
enough
to
overhear
it
was
delivered
by
a
little
man
in
an
aureole
of
indigo
hair
who
brushed
his
great
sombrero
violently
as
he
spoke
and
raffles
listened
i
could
see
from
their
manner
that
the
collision
which
had
just
occurred
was
not
the
subject
under
discussion
but
i
failed
to
distinguish
a
word
though
i
listened
outside
a
hatter
until
raffles
had
gone
in
and
his
new
acquaintance
had
passed
me
with
blazing
eyes
and
a
volley
of
husky
vows
in
broken
english
another
of
shylock
victims
thought
i
and
indeed
he
might
have
been
bleeding
internally
from
the
loss
of
his
pound
of
flesh
at
any
rate
there
was
bloodshed
in
his
eyes
i
stood
a
long
time
outside
that
hatter
window
and
finally
went
in
to
choose
a
cap
but
the
light
is
wicked
in
those
narrow
shops
and
this
necessitated
my
carrying
several
caps
to
the
broad
daylight
of
the
threshold
to
gauge
their
shades
and
incidentally
to
achieve
a
swift
survey
of
the
street
then
they
crowned
me
with
an
ingenious
apparatus
like
a
typewriter
to
get
the
exact
shape
and
measure
of
my
skull
for
i
had
intimated
that
i
had
no
desire
to
dress
it
anywhere
else
for
the
future
all
this
must
have
taken
up
the
most
of
twenty
minutes
yet
after
getting
as
far
as
shylock
i
remembered
that
i
required
what
hatter
and
no
one
else
calls
a
boater
and
back
i
went
to
order
one
in
addition
to
the
cap
and
as
the
next
tack
fetches
the
buoy
so
my
next
perambulation
in
which
however
i
was
thinking
seriously
of
a
new
bowler
brought
me
face
to
face
with
raffles
once
more
we
shouted
and
shook
hands
our
encounter
had
taken
place
almost
under
the
windows
and
it
was
so
in
its
cordiality
that
between
our
slaps
and
grasps
raffles
managed
deftly
to
insert
a
stout
packet
in
my
breast
pocket
i
can
not
think
the
most
critical
pedestrian
could
have
seen
it
done
but
streets
have
as
many
eyes
as
argus
and
some
of
them
are
always
on
one
they
had
to
send
to
the
bank
for
it
whispered
raffles
it
barely
passed
through
their
hands
but
do
you
let
shylock
spot
his
own
envelope
in
another
second
he
was
saying
something
very
different
that
anybody
might
have
heard
and
in
yet
another
he
was
hustling
me
across
threshold
i
take
you
up
and
introduce
you
he
cried
aloud
you
could
come
to
a
better
man
my
dear
fellow
he
the
only
honest
one
in
europe
is
levy
disengaged
a
stunted
young
gentleman
who
spoke
as
though
he
had
a
or
was
in
liquor
neither
calamity
having
really
befallen
him
said
that
he
thought
so
but
would
see
which
he
proceeded
to
do
through
a
telephone
after
shifting
the
indicator
from
through
to
private
he
slid
off
his
stool
at
once
and
another
youth
of
similar
appearance
and
still
more
similar
peculiarity
of
speech
who
entered
in
a
hurry
at
that
moment
was
told
to
hold
on
while
he
showed
the
gentlemen
there
were
other
clerks
behind
the
mahogany
bulwark
and
we
heard
the
newcomer
greeting
them
hoarsely
as
we
climbed
up
into
the
presence
dan
levy
as
i
must
try
to
call
him
when
raffles
is
not
varnishing
my
tale
looked
a
very
big
man
at
his
enormous
desk
but
by
no
means
so
elephantine
as
at
the
tiny
table
in
the
savoy
restaurant
a
month
earlier
his
privations
had
not
only
reduced
his
bulk
to
the
naked
eye
but
made
him
look
ten
years
younger
he
wore
the
habiliments
of
a
gentleman
even
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
his
coat
and
tie
filled
me
with
that
inconsequent
respect
which
the
silk
pyjamas
had
engendered
in
raffles
but
the
great
face
that
greeted
us
with
a
shrewd
and
rather
scornful
geniality
impressed
me
yet
more
powerfully
in
its
massive
features
and
its
craggy
contour
it
displayed
the
frank
pugnacity
of
the
pugilist
rather
than
the
low
cunning
of
the
traditional
usurer
and
the
nose
in
particular
while
of
far
healthier
appearance
than
when
i
had
seen
it
first
and
last
was
both
dominant
and
menacing
in
its
immensity
it
was
a
comfort
to
turn
from
this
formidable
countenance
to
that
of
raffles
who
had
entered
with
his
own
serene
unconscious
confidence
and
now
introduced
us
with
that
inimitable
air
of
authority
which
stamped
him
in
all
shades
of
society
to
meet
you
sir
i
hope
you
well
said
levy
dropping
one
aspirate
but
putting
in
the
next
with
care
take
a
seat
sir
please
but
i
kept
my
legs
though
i
felt
them
near
to
trembling
and
diving
a
hand
into
a
breast
pocket
i
began
working
the
contents
out
of
the
envelope
that
raffles
had
given
me
while
i
spoke
out
in
a
tone
sufficiently
rehearsed
at
the
albany
overnight
i
not
so
sure
about
the
happiness
said
i
i
mean
about
its
lasting
levy
i
come
from
my
friend
edward
garland
i
thought
you
came
to
borrow
money
interposed
raffles
with
much
indignation
the
moneylender
was
watching
me
with
bright
eyes
and
lips
i
could
no
longer
see
i
never
said
so
i
rapped
out
at
raffles
and
i
thought
i
saw
approval
and
encouragement
behind
his
stare
like
truth
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
who
the
little
biter
the
inquired
of
him
with
delightful
insolence
an
old
friend
of
mine
replied
raffles
in
an
injured
tone
that
made
a
convincing
end
of
the
old
friendship
i
thought
he
was
hard
up
or
i
never
should
have
brought
him
in
to
introduce
to
you
i
did
ask
you
for
your
introduction
raffles
said
i
offensively
i
simply
met
you
coming
out
as
i
was
coming
in
i
thought
you
damned
officious
if
you
ask
me
whereupon
with
an
threat
of
subsequent
violence
to
my
person
raffles
flung
open
the
door
to
leave
us
to
our
interview
this
was
exactly
as
it
had
been
rehearsed
but
dan
levy
called
raffles
back
and
that
was
exactly
as
we
had
hoped
gentlemen
gentlemen
said
the
jew
please
do
make
a
cockpit
of
my
office
gentlemen
and
pray
raffles
do
leave
me
to
the
mercies
of
your
very
dangerous
friend
you
can
be
two
to
one
if
you
like
i
gasped
valiantly
do
care
and
my
chest
heaved
in
accordance
with
my
stage
instructions
as
also
with
a
realism
to
which
it
was
a
relief
to
give
full
play
come
now
said
levy
what
did
garland
send
you
about
you
know
well
enough
said
i
his
debt
to
you
do
be
rude
about
it
said
levy
what
about
the
debt
it
a
damned
disgrace
said
i
i
quite
agree
he
chuckled
it
ought
to
been
settled
months
ago
months
ago
i
echoed
it
only
twelve
months
since
he
borrowed
three
hundred
pounds
from
you
and
now
you
sticking
him
for
seven
i
am
said
levy
opening
uncompromising
lips
that
entirely
disappeared
again
next
instant
he
borrows
three
hundred
for
a
year
at
the
outside
and
you
blackmail
him
for
eight
hundred
when
the
year
up
you
said
just
now
interrupted
raffles
but
in
the
voice
of
a
man
who
was
getting
a
fright
you
also
said
added
dan
levy
portentously
do
you
want
to
be
thrown
downstairs
do
deny
the
figures
i
retorted
no
i
do
have
you
got
his
repayment
cards
yes
here
in
my
hands
and
they
sha
leave
them
you
see
you
not
aware
i
added
severely
as
i
turned
to
raffles
that
this
young
fellow
has
already
paid
up
one
hundred
in
instalments
that
what
makes
the
eight
and
all
this
is
what
happen
to
you
if
you
been
fool
enough
to
get
into
the
same
boat
the
had
borne
with
me
longer
than
either
of
us
had
expected
that
he
would
but
now
he
wheeled
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
a
pillar
of
peril
and
a
mouthful
of
oaths
is
that
all
you
come
to
say
he
thundered
if
so
you
young
devil
out
you
go
no
it
is
said
i
spreading
out
a
document
attached
to
the
cards
of
receipt
which
raffles
had
obtained
from
teddy
garland
these
i
had
managed
to
extract
without
anything
else
from
the
inner
pocket
in
which
i
had
been
trying
to
empty
out
raffles
envelope
here
i
continued
is
a
letter
written
only
yesterday
by
you
to
garland
in
which
you
say
among
other
very
insolent
things
is
final
and
absolutely
no
excuses
of
any
kind
will
be
tolerated
or
accepted
you
have
given
ten
times
more
trouble
than
your
custom
is
worth
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
you
so
you
had
better
pay
up
before
twelve
as
you
may
depend
that
the
above
threats
will
be
carried
out
to
the
very
letter
and
steps
will
be
taken
to
carry
them
into
effect
at
that
hour
this
is
your
dead
and
last
chance
and
the
last
time
i
will
write
you
on
the
subject
so
it
is
said
levy
with
an
oath
this
is
a
very
bad
case
mr
raffles
i
agree
said
i
and
may
i
ask
if
you
propose
to
rid
of
garland
by
making
him
up
in
full
before
twelve
said
dan
levy
with
a
snap
of
his
jaws
eight
hundred
first
and
last
for
the
three
hundred
he
borrowed
a
year
ago
that
it
surely
that
very
hard
on
the
boy
i
said
reaching
the
conciliatory
stage
by
degrees
on
which
raffles
paid
me
many
compliments
later
but
at
the
time
he
remarked
i
should
say
it
was
his
own
fault
of
course
it
is
raffles
cried
the
moneylender
taking
a
more
conciliatory
tone
himself
it
was
my
money
it
was
my
three
golden
sovereigns
and
you
can
sell
what
yours
for
what
it
fetch
ca
you
obviously
said
raffles
very
well
then
money
like
anything
else
if
you
have
got
it
and
ca
beg
or
earn
it
you
got
to
buy
it
at
a
price
i
sell
my
money
that
all
and
i
a
right
to
sell
it
at
a
fancy
price
if
i
can
get
a
fancy
price
for
it
a
man
may
be
a
fool
to
pay
my
figure
that
depends
much
he
wants
the
money
at
the
time
and
it
his
affair
not
mine
your
gay
young
friend
was
all
right
if
he
had
defaulted
but
a
defaulter
deserves
to
pay
through
the
nose
and
be
damned
to
him
it
was
me
let
your
friend
in
he
let
in
himself
with
his
eyes
open
garland
knew
very
well
what
i
was
charging
him
and
what
i
to
charge
over
and
above
if
he
gave
me
half
a
chance
why
should
i
was
it
in
the
bond
what
do
you
all
think
i
run
my
show
for
business
raffles
not
robbery
my
dear
sir
all
business
is
robbery
if
you
come
to
that
but
you
find
mine
is
all
and
in
the
bond
a
very
admirable
exposition
said
raffles
weightily
not
that
it
applies
to
you
raffles
the
other
was
adroit
enough
to
add
garland
was
no
friend
of
mine
and
he
was
a
fool
whereas
i
hope
i
may
say
that
you
the
one
and
not
the
other
then
it
comes
to
this
said
i
that
you
mean
him
to
pay
up
in
full
this
morning
by
noon
and
it
just
gone
ten
the
whole
seven
hundred
pounds
sterling
said
levy
no
cheques
entertained
then
said
i
with
an
air
of
final
defeat
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
my
instructions
and
pay
you
now
on
the
nail
i
did
not
look
at
levy
but
i
heard
the
sudden
intake
of
his
breath
at
the
sight
of
my
and
i
felt
its
baleful
exhalation
on
my
forehead
as
i
stooped
and
began
counting
them
out
upon
his
desk
i
had
made
some
progress
before
he
addressed
me
in
terms
of
protest
there
was
almost
a
tremor
in
his
voice
i
had
no
call
to
be
so
hasty
it
looked
as
though
i
had
been
playing
a
game
with
him
why
could
i
tell
him
i
had
the
money
with
me
all
the
time
the
question
was
asked
with
a
sudden
oath
because
i
had
gone
on
counting
it
out
regardless
of
his
overtures
i
took
as
little
notice
of
his
anger
and
now
levy
i
concluded
may
i
ask
you
to
return
me
garland
promissory
note
yes
you
may
ask
and
you
shall
receive
he
snarled
and
opened
his
safe
so
violently
that
the
keys
fell
out
raffles
replaced
them
with
exemplary
promptitude
while
the
note
of
hand
was
being
found
the
evil
little
document
was
in
my
possession
at
last
levy
roared
down
the
tube
and
the
young
man
of
the
imperfect
diction
duly
appeared
take
that
young
biter
cried
levy
and
throw
him
into
the
street
call
up
moses
to
lend
you
a
but
the
first
murderer
stood
nonplussed
looking
from
raffles
to
me
and
finally
inquiring
which
biter
his
master
meant
that
one
bellowed
the
shaking
a
lethal
fist
at
me
raffles
is
a
friend
o
mine
but
a
friend
of
too
lisped
the
young
man
thimeon
markth
come
acroth
the
thtreet
to
tell
me
tho
he
thaw
them
thake
handth
outthide
our
plathe
after
he
theen
in
piccadilly
he
come
in
to
thay
tho
in
cathe
but
the
youth
of
limited
articulation
was
not
allowed
to
finish
his
explanation
he
was
grasped
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
kicked
and
shaken
out
of
the
room
and
his
collar
flung
after
him
i
heard
him
blubbering
on
the
stairs
as
levy
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
but
i
did
not
hear
raffles
slip
into
the
swivel
chair
behind
the
desk
or
know
that
he
had
done
so
until
the
usurer
and
i
turned
round
together
out
of
that
blustered
levy
but
raffles
tilted
the
chair
back
on
its
spring
and
laughed
softly
in
his
face
not
if
i
know
it
said
he
if
you
do
open
the
door
in
about
one
minute
i
shall
require
this
telephone
of
yours
to
ring
up
the
police
the
police
eh
said
levy
with
a
sinister
recovery
of
you
better
leave
that
to
me
you
precious
pair
of
swindlers
besides
continued
raffles
of
course
you
keep
an
ad
in
one
of
these
drawers
ah
here
it
is
and
just
as
well
in
my
hands
as
in
yours
he
had
opened
the
top
drawer
in
the
pedestal
and
taken
therefrom
a
big
bulldog
revolver
it
was
the
work
of
few
moments
to
empty
its
five
chambers
and
hand
the
pistol
by
its
barrel
to
the
owner
curse
you
hissed
the
latter
hurling
it
into
the
fender
with
a
fearful
clatter
but
you
pay
for
this
my
fine
gentlemen
this
is
sharp
practice
but
criminal
fraud
the
burden
of
proof
said
raffles
lies
with
you
meanwhile
will
you
be
good
enough
to
open
that
door
instead
of
looking
as
sick
as
a
cold
the
had
indeed
turned
as
grey
as
his
hair
and
his
eyebrows
which
were
black
and
looked
dyed
stood
out
like
smears
of
ink
nevertheless
the
simile
which
raffles
had
employed
with
his
own
unfortunate
facility
was
more
picturesque
than
discreet
i
saw
it
set
shylock
thinking
luckily
the
evil
of
the
day
was
sufficient
for
it
and
him
but
so
far
from
complying
he
set
his
back
to
the
locked
door
and
swore
a
sweet
oath
never
to
budge
oh
very
well
resumed
raffles
and
the
receiver
was
at
his
ear
without
more
ado
is
that
the
exchange
give
me
gerrard
will
you
it
fraud
reiterated
levy
and
you
know
it
it
nothing
of
the
sort
and
know
it
murmured
raffles
with
the
proper
of
the
man
at
the
telephone
you
lent
the
money
i
added
that
your
business
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
what
he
chooses
to
do
with
it
he
a
cursed
swindler
hissed
levy
and
you
his
damned
decoy
i
was
not
sorry
to
see
raffles
face
light
up
across
the
desk
is
that
howson
anstruther
and
martin
they
only
my
solicitors
levy
put
me
through
to
martin
please
that
you
charlie
you
might
come
in
a
cab
to
jermyn
street
i
forget
the
number
dan
levy
the
thanks
old
chap
wait
a
bit
charlie
a
constable
but
dan
levy
had
unlocked
his
door
and
flung
it
open
there
you
are
you
scoundrels
but
we
meet
again
my
fine
raffles
was
frowning
at
the
telephone
i
been
cut
off
said
he
wait
a
bit
clear
call
for
you
levy
i
believe
and
they
changed
places
without
exchanging
another
word
until
raffles
and
i
were
on
the
stairs
why
the
not
even
yelled
the
rushing
out
but
are
mr
levy
cried
raffles
and
down
we
ran
into
the
street
chapter
v
thin
air
raffles
hailed
a
passing
hansom
and
had
bundled
me
in
before
i
realised
that
he
was
not
coming
with
me
drive
down
to
the
club
for
teddy
said
he
we
make
him
get
straight
into
flannels
to
save
time
order
breakfast
for
three
in
precisely
and
i
tell
him
everything
before
you
back
his
eyes
were
shining
with
the
prospect
as
i
drove
away
not
sorry
to
escape
the
scene
of
that
young
man
awakening
to
better
fortune
than
he
deserved
for
in
my
heart
i
could
not
quite
forgive
the
act
in
which
raffles
and
i
had
caught
him
overnight
raffles
might
make
as
light
of
it
as
he
pleased
it
was
impossible
for
another
to
take
his
affectionately
lenient
view
not
of
the
moral
question
involved
but
of
the
breach
of
faith
between
friend
and
friend
my
own
feeling
in
the
matter
however
if
a
little
jaundiced
was
not
so
strong
as
to
prevent
me
from
gloating
over
the
victory
in
which
i
had
just
assisted
i
thought
of
the
notorious
extortioner
who
had
fallen
to
our
unscrupulous
but
not
indictable
wiles
and
my
heart
tinkled
with
the
hansom
bell
i
thought
of
the
good
that
we
had
done
for
once
of
the
undoubted
wrong
we
had
contrived
to
right
by
a
species
of
justifiable
chicanery
and
i
forgot
all
about
the
youth
whose
battle
we
had
fought
and
won
until
i
found
myself
ordering
his
breakfast
and
having
his
taken
out
to
my
cab
raffles
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
albany
courtyard
i
thought
he
was
frowning
at
the
sky
which
was
not
what
it
had
been
earlier
in
the
morning
until
i
remembered
how
little
time
there
was
to
lose
have
you
seen
anything
of
him
he
cried
as
i
jumped
out
of
whom
raffles
teddy
of
course
teddy
garland
has
he
gone
out
before
i
got
in
said
raffles
grimly
i
wonder
where
the
devil
he
is
he
had
paid
the
cabman
and
taken
down
the
bag
himself
i
followed
him
up
to
his
rooms
but
what
the
meaning
of
it
raffles
that
what
i
want
to
know
could
he
have
gone
out
for
a
paper
they
were
all
here
before
i
went
i
left
them
on
his
bed
or
for
a
shave
that
more
likely
but
he
been
out
nearly
an
hour
but
you
ca
have
been
gone
much
longer
yourself
raffles
and
i
understood
you
left
him
fast
asleep
that
the
worst
of
it
bunny
he
must
have
been
shamming
barraclough
saw
him
go
out
ten
minutes
after
me
could
you
have
disturbed
him
when
you
went
raffles
shook
his
head
i
never
shut
a
door
more
carefully
in
my
life
i
made
row
enough
when
i
came
back
bunny
on
purpose
to
wake
him
up
and
i
can
tell
you
it
gave
me
a
turn
when
there
was
a
sound
from
in
there
he
shut
all
the
doors
after
him
it
was
a
second
or
two
before
i
had
the
pluck
to
open
them
i
thought
something
horrible
had
happened
you
do
think
so
still
i
do
know
what
to
think
said
raffles
gloomily
nothing
has
panned
out
as
i
thought
it
would
you
must
remember
that
we
have
given
ourselves
away
to
dan
levy
whatever
else
we
have
done
and
without
doubt
set
up
the
enemy
of
our
lives
in
the
very
next
street
it
close
quarters
bunny
we
shall
have
an
expert
eye
upon
us
for
some
time
to
come
but
i
should
rather
enjoy
that
than
otherwise
if
only
teddy
had
bolted
in
this
rotten
way
never
had
i
known
raffles
in
so
pessimistic
a
mood
i
did
not
share
his
sombre
view
of
either
matter
though
i
confined
my
remarks
to
the
one
that
seemed
to
weigh
most
heavily
on
his
mind
a
guinea
to
a
gooseberry
i
wagered
that
you
find
your
man
safe
and
sound
at
lord
i
rang
them
up
ten
minutes
ago
said
raffles
they
had
heard
of
him
then
besides
here
his
he
may
have
been
at
the
club
when
i
fetched
it
away
i
never
asked
i
did
bunny
i
rang
them
up
as
well
just
after
you
had
left
then
what
about
his
father
house
that
our
one
chance
said
raffles
they
not
on
the
telephone
but
now
that
you
here
i
a
good
mind
to
drive
out
and
see
if
there
you
know
what
a
state
he
was
in
last
night
and
you
know
how
a
thing
can
seem
worse
when
you
wake
and
remember
it
than
it
did
at
the
time
it
happened
i
begin
to
hope
he
gone
straight
to
old
garland
with
the
whole
story
in
that
case
he
bound
to
come
back
for
his
kit
and
by
jove
bunny
there
a
step
upon
the
stairs
we
had
left
the
doors
open
behind
us
and
a
step
it
was
ascending
hastily
enough
to
our
floor
but
it
was
not
the
step
of
a
very
young
man
and
raffles
was
the
first
to
recognise
the
fact
his
face
fell
as
we
looked
at
each
other
for
a
single
moment
of
suspense
in
another
he
was
out
of
the
room
and
i
heard
him
greeting
garland
on
the
landing
then
you
have
brought
teddy
with
you
i
heard
raffles
add
do
you
mean
to
say
he
is
here
replied
so
pleasant
a
voice
in
accents
of
such
acute
dismay
that
garland
had
my
sympathy
before
we
met
he
has
been
said
raffles
and
i
expecting
him
back
every
minute
wo
you
come
in
and
wait
mr
garland
the
pleasant
voice
made
an
exclamation
of
premature
relief
the
pair
entered
and
i
was
introduced
to
the
last
person
i
should
have
suspected
of
being
a
retired
brewer
at
all
much
less
of
squandering
his
money
in
retirement
as
suggested
by
his
son
i
was
prepared
for
a
conventional
embodiment
of
reckless
prosperity
for
a
type
in
louder
purple
and
finer
linen
than
the
real
thing
i
shook
hands
instead
with
a
gentle
elderly
man
whose
kindly
eyes
beamed
bravely
amid
careworn
furrows
and
whose
slightly
diffident
yet
wholly
cordial
address
won
my
heart
outright
so
you
lost
no
time
in
welcoming
the
wanderer
said
he
nearly
as
bad
as
my
boy
who
was
quite
bent
on
seeing
raffles
last
night
or
first
thing
this
morning
he
told
me
he
should
stay
the
night
in
town
if
necessary
and
he
evidently
has
there
was
still
a
trace
of
anxiety
in
the
father
manner
but
there
was
also
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
which
kindled
with
genial
fires
as
raffles
gave
a
perfectly
truthful
account
of
the
young
man
movements
as
distinct
from
his
words
and
deeds
overnight
and
what
do
you
think
of
his
great
news
asked
garland
was
it
a
surprise
to
you
raffles
raffles
shook
his
head
with
a
rather
weary
smile
and
i
sat
up
in
my
chair
what
great
news
was
this
this
son
of
mine
has
just
got
engaged
explained
garland
for
my
benefit
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
his
engagement
that
brings
me
here
you
gentlemen
must
think
i
want
to
keep
an
eagle
eye
upon
him
but
miss
belsize
has
just
wired
to
say
she
is
coming
up
early
to
go
with
us
to
the
match
instead
of
meeting
at
lord
and
i
thought
she
would
be
so
disappointed
not
to
find
teddy
especially
as
they
are
bound
to
see
very
little
of
each
other
all
day
i
for
my
part
was
wondering
why
i
had
not
heard
of
miss
belsize
or
this
engagement
from
raffles
he
must
himself
have
heard
of
it
last
thing
at
night
in
the
next
room
while
i
was
here
at
the
open
window
yet
in
all
the
small
hours
he
had
never
told
me
of
a
circumstance
which
extenuated
young
garland
conduct
if
it
did
nothing
else
even
now
it
was
not
from
raffles
that
i
received
either
word
or
look
of
explanation
but
his
face
had
suddenly
lit
up
may
i
ask
he
exclaimed
if
the
telegram
was
to
teddy
or
to
you
mr
garland
it
was
addressed
to
teddy
but
of
course
i
opened
it
in
his
absence
could
it
have
been
an
answer
to
an
invitation
or
suggestion
of
his
very
easily
they
had
lunch
together
yesterday
and
camilla
might
have
had
to
consult
lady
laura
then
that
the
whole
thing
cried
raffles
teddy
was
on
his
way
home
while
you
were
on
yours
into
town
how
did
you
come
in
the
brougham
through
the
park
yes
while
he
was
in
a
hansom
in
knightsbridge
or
kensington
gore
how
you
missed
him
said
raffles
confidently
if
you
drive
straight
back
you
be
in
time
to
take
him
on
to
lord
garland
begged
us
both
to
drive
back
with
him
and
we
thought
we
might
we
decided
that
we
would
and
were
all
three
under
way
in
about
a
minute
yet
it
was
considerably
after
eleven
when
we
bowled
through
kensington
to
a
house
that
i
had
never
seen
before
a
house
since
swept
away
by
the
flowing
tide
of
flats
but
i
can
still
see
every
stone
and
slate
of
it
as
clearly
as
on
that
summer
morning
more
than
ten
years
ago
it
stood
just
off
the
thoroughfare
in
grounds
of
its
own
out
of
all
keeping
with
their
metropolitan
environment
they
ran
from
one
to
another
and
further
back
than
we
could
see
vivid
lawn
and
towering
tree
brilliant
beds
and
crystal
vineries
struck
one
more
forcibly
and
favourably
than
the
mullioned
and
turreted
mansion
of
a
house
and
yet
a
double
stream
of
omnibuses
rattled
incessantly
within
a
few
yards
of
the
steps
on
which
the
three
of
us
soon
stood
nonplussed
edward
had
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
at
the
house
neither
had
miss
belsize
arrived
that
was
the
one
consolatory
feature
come
into
the
library
said
garland
and
when
we
were
among
his
books
which
were
somewhat
beautifully
bound
and
cased
in
glass
he
turned
to
raffles
and
added
hoarsely
there
something
in
all
this
i
have
been
told
and
i
insist
on
knowing
what
it
is
but
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
protested
raffles
i
went
out
leaving
teddy
asleep
and
came
back
to
find
him
flown
what
time
was
that
between
nine
and
when
i
went
out
i
was
away
nearly
an
hour
why
leave
him
asleep
at
that
time
of
morning
i
wanted
him
to
have
every
minute
he
could
get
we
had
been
sitting
up
rather
late
but
why
raffles
what
could
you
have
to
talk
about
all
night
when
you
were
tired
and
it
was
teddy
business
to
keep
fresh
for
why
after
all
should
he
want
to
see
you
the
moment
you
got
back
he
not
the
first
young
fellow
who
got
rather
suddenly
engaged
to
a
charming
girl
is
he
in
any
trouble
about
it
raffles
about
his
engagement
not
that
i
aware
then
he
is
in
some
trouble
he
was
garland
answered
raffles
i
give
you
my
word
that
he
is
now
garland
grasped
the
back
of
a
chair
was
it
some
money
trouble
raffles
of
course
if
my
boy
has
given
you
his
confidence
i
have
no
right
simply
as
his
father
it
is
hardly
that
sir
said
raffles
gently
it
is
i
who
have
no
right
to
give
him
away
but
if
you
do
mind
leaving
it
at
that
garland
there
is
perhaps
no
harm
in
my
saying
that
it
about
some
little
temporary
embarrassment
that
teddy
was
so
anxious
to
see
me
and
you
helped
him
cried
the
poor
man
plainly
torn
between
gratitude
and
humiliation
not
out
of
my
pocket
replied
raffles
smiling
the
matter
was
not
so
serious
as
teddy
thought
it
only
required
adjustment
god
bless
you
raffles
murmured
garland
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
i
wo
ask
for
a
single
detail
my
poor
boy
went
to
the
right
man
he
knew
better
than
to
come
to
me
like
father
like
son
he
muttered
to
himself
and
dropped
into
the
chair
he
had
been
handling
and
bent
his
head
over
his
folded
arms
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
untoward
effect
of
teddy
disappearance
in
the
peculiar
humiliation
of
its
first
cause
raffles
took
out
his
watch
and
held
up
the
dial
for
me
to
see
it
was
after
the
now
but
at
this
moment
a
servant
entered
with
a
missive
and
the
master
recovered
his
this
be
from
teddy
he
cried
fumbling
with
his
glasses
no
for
him
and
by
special
messenger
i
better
open
it
i
do
suppose
it
miss
belsize
again
miss
belsize
is
in
the
sir
said
the
man
she
said
you
were
not
to
be
disturbed
oh
tell
her
we
sha
be
long
said
garland
with
a
new
strain
of
trouble
in
his
tone
listen
to
this
listen
to
this
he
went
on
before
the
door
was
shut
has
happened
lost
toss
whipham
plays
if
you
do
turn
up
in
j
jack
studley
said
raffles
the
cambridge
skipper
i
know
i
know
and
whipham
reserve
man
is
he
and
another
worse
luck
exclaimed
raffles
if
he
turns
out
and
takes
a
single
ball
and
teddy
is
only
one
over
late
it
will
still
be
too
late
for
him
to
play
then
it
too
late
already
said
garland
sinking
back
into
his
chair
with
a
groan
but
that
note
from
studley
may
have
been
on
the
way
no
raffles
it
not
an
ordinary
note
it
a
message
telephoned
straight
from
lord
probably
within
the
last
few
minutes
to
a
messenger
office
not
a
hundred
yards
from
this
door
garland
sat
staring
miserably
at
the
carpet
he
was
beginning
to
look
ill
with
perplexity
and
suspense
raffles
himself
who
had
turned
his
back
upon
us
with
a
shrug
of
acquiescence
in
the
inevitable
was
a
monument
of
discomfiture
as
he
stood
gazing
through
a
glass
door
into
the
adjoining
conservatory
there
was
no
actual
window
in
the
library
but
this
door
was
a
single
sheet
of
into
which
a
man
might
well
have
walked
and
i
can
still
see
raffles
in
silhouette
upon
a
panel
of
palms
and
i
see
the
silhouette
grow
tall
and
straight
again
before
my
eyes
the
door
open
and
raffles
listening
with
an
alert
lift
of
the
head
i
too
hear
something
an
elfin
hiss
a
fairy
fusillade
and
then
the
sudden
laugh
with
which
raffles
rejoined
us
in
the
body
of
the
room
it
raining
he
cried
waving
a
hand
above
his
head
have
you
a
barometer
mr
garland
that
an
aneroid
under
the
how
often
do
you
set
the
indicator
last
thing
every
night
i
remember
it
was
between
fair
and
change
when
i
went
to
bed
it
made
me
anxious
it
may
make
you
thankful
now
it
between
change
and
rain
this
morning
and
the
rain
begun
and
while
there
rain
there
hope
in
a
twinkling
raffles
had
regained
all
his
own
irresistible
buoyancy
and
assurance
but
the
older
man
was
not
capable
of
so
prompt
a
recovery
something
has
happened
to
my
boy
but
not
necessarily
anything
terrible
if
i
knew
what
raffles
if
only
i
knew
what
raffles
eyed
the
pale
and
twitching
face
with
sidelong
solicitude
he
himself
had
the
confident
expression
which
always
gave
me
confidence
the
rattle
on
the
conservatory
roof
was
growing
louder
every
minute
i
intend
to
find
out
said
he
and
if
the
rain
goes
on
long
enough
we
may
still
see
teddy
playing
when
it
stops
but
i
shall
want
your
help
sir
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
anywhere
raffles
you
can
only
help
me
garland
by
staying
where
you
are
where
i
am
in
the
house
all
day
said
raffles
firmly
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
my
idea
and
that
is
raffles
to
save
teddy
face
in
the
first
instance
i
shall
drive
straight
up
to
lord
in
your
brougham
if
i
may
i
know
studley
rather
well
he
shall
keep
teddy
place
open
till
the
last
possible
moment
but
how
shall
you
account
for
his
absence
i
asked
i
shall
account
for
it
all
right
said
raffles
darkly
i
can
save
his
face
for
the
time
being
at
all
events
at
lord
but
that
the
only
place
that
matters
said
i
on
the
contrary
bunny
this
very
house
matters
even
more
as
long
as
miss
belsize
is
here
you
forget
that
they
engaged
and
that
she
in
the
next
room
now
good
god
whispered
garland
i
had
forgotten
that
myself
she
is
the
last
who
must
know
of
this
affair
said
raffles
with
i
thought
undue
authority
and
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
keep
it
from
her
sir
i
miss
belsize
must
go
up
to
lord
this
morning
she
would
only
spoil
her
things
and
you
may
tell
her
from
me
that
there
would
be
no
play
for
an
hour
after
this
even
if
it
stopped
this
minute
which
it
wo
meanwhile
let
her
think
that
teddy
weatherbound
with
the
rest
of
them
in
the
pavilion
but
she
must
come
until
you
hear
from
me
again
and
the
best
way
to
keep
her
here
is
to
stay
with
her
yourself
and
when
may
i
expect
to
hear
asked
garland
as
raffles
held
out
his
hand
let
me
see
i
shall
be
at
lord
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
another
five
or
ten
should
polish
off
studley
and
then
i
shall
barricade
myself
in
the
and
ring
up
every
hospital
in
town
you
see
it
may
be
an
accident
after
all
though
i
do
think
so
you
wo
hear
from
me
on
the
point
unless
it
is
the
fewer
messengers
flying
about
the
better
if
you
agree
with
me
as
to
the
wisdom
of
keeping
the
matter
dark
at
this
end
oh
yes
i
agree
with
you
raffles
but
it
will
be
a
terribly
hard
task
for
me
it
will
indeed
garland
yet
no
news
is
always
good
news
and
i
promise
to
come
straight
to
you
the
moment
i
have
news
of
any
kind
with
that
they
shook
hands
our
host
with
an
obvious
reluctance
that
turned
to
a
less
understandable
dismay
as
i
also
prepared
to
take
my
leave
of
him
what
cried
he
am
i
to
be
left
quite
alone
to
hoodwink
that
poor
girl
and
hide
my
own
anxiety
there
no
reason
why
you
should
come
bunny
said
raffles
to
me
if
either
of
them
is
a
job
it
mine
our
host
said
no
more
but
he
looked
at
me
so
wistfully
that
i
could
not
but
offer
to
stay
with
him
if
he
wished
it
and
when
at
length
the
door
had
closed
upon
him
and
his
son
i
took
an
umbrella
from
the
stand
and
saw
raffles
through
the
providential
downpour
into
the
brougham
i
sorry
bunny
he
muttered
between
the
butler
in
the
porch
and
the
coachman
on
the
box
this
sort
of
thing
is
neither
in
my
line
nor
yours
but
it
serves
us
right
for
straying
from
the
path
of
candid
crime
we
should
have
opened
a
safe
for
that
seven
hundred
but
what
do
you
really
think
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
extraordinary
disappearance
some
madness
or
other
i
afraid
but
if
that
boy
is
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
shall
have
him
before
the
sun
goes
down
on
his
insanity
and
what
about
this
engagement
of
his
i
pursued
do
you
disapprove
of
it
why
on
earth
should
i
asked
raffles
rather
sharply
as
he
plunged
from
under
my
umbrella
into
the
brougham
because
you
never
told
me
when
he
told
you
i
replied
is
the
girl
beneath
him
raffles
looked
at
me
inscrutably
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
you
better
find
out
for
yourself
said
he
tell
the
coachman
to
hurry
up
to
lord
and
pray
that
this
rain
may
last
chapter
vi
camilla
belsize
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
refuge
on
a
rainy
day
than
the
amphibious
retreat
described
by
raffles
as
a
country
house
in
kensington
there
was
a
good
square
hall
full
of
the
club
comforts
so
welcome
in
a
home
such
as
magazines
and
cigarettes
and
a
fire
when
the
rain
set
in
the
usual
rooms
opened
off
the
hall
and
the
library
was
not
the
only
one
that
led
on
into
the
conservatory
the
was
another
in
which
i
heard
voices
as
i
lit
a
cigarette
among
the
palms
and
it
struck
me
that
poor
garland
was
finding
it
hard
work
to
propitiate
the
lady
whom
raffles
had
deemed
unworthy
of
mention
overnight
but
i
own
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
take
over
the
invidious
task
to
me
it
need
prove
nothing
more
to
him
anguish
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
even
as
matters
stood
i
was
quite
sufficiently
embroiled
in
these
people
affairs
their
name
had
been
little
more
than
a
name
to
me
until
the
last
few
hours
only
yesterday
i
might
have
hesitated
to
nod
to
teddy
garland
at
the
club
so
seldom
had
we
met
yet
here
was
i
helping
raffles
to
keep
the
worst
about
the
son
from
the
father
knowledge
and
on
the
point
of
helping
that
father
to
keep
what
might
easily
prove
worse
still
from
his
to
be
and
all
the
time
there
was
the
worst
of
all
to
be
hidden
from
everybody
concerning
raffles
and
me
meanwhile
i
explored
a
system
of
and
vineries
that
ran
out
from
the
conservatory
in
a
continuous
chain
each
link
with
its
own
temperature
and
its
individual
scent
and
not
a
pane
but
rattled
and
streamed
beneath
the
timely
torrent
it
was
in
a
fernery
where
a
playing
fountain
added
its
tuneful
drop
to
the
noisy
deluge
that
the
voices
of
the
sounded
suddenly
at
my
elbow
and
i
was
introduced
to
miss
belsize
before
i
could
recover
from
my
surprise
my
foolish
face
must
have
made
her
smile
in
spite
of
herself
for
i
did
not
see
quite
the
same
smile
again
all
day
but
it
made
me
her
admirer
on
the
spot
and
i
really
think
she
warmed
to
me
for
amusing
her
even
for
a
moment
so
we
began
rather
well
and
that
was
a
mercy
in
the
light
of
poor
garland
cynically
prompt
departure
but
we
did
not
go
on
quite
as
well
as
we
had
begun
i
do
not
say
that
miss
belsize
was
in
a
bad
temper
but
emphatically
she
was
not
pleased
and
i
for
one
had
the
utmost
sympathy
with
her
displeasure
she
was
simply
but
exquisitely
dressed
with
unostentatious
touches
of
cambridge
blue
and
a
picture
hat
that
really
was
a
picture
yet
on
a
perfect
stranger
in
a
humid
rockery
she
was
wasting
what
had
been
meant
for
mankind
at
lord
the
only
consolation
i
could
suggest
was
that
by
this
time
lord
would
be
more
humid
still
and
so
there
something
to
be
said
for
being
bored
to
tears
under
shelter
miss
belsize
miss
belsize
did
not
deny
that
she
was
bored
but
there
plenty
of
shelter
there
said
she
packed
with
draggled
dresses
and
squelching
shoes
you
might
swim
for
it
before
they
admitted
you
to
that
pavilion
you
know
but
if
the
ground
under
water
how
can
they
play
they
ca
miss
belsize
i
do
mind
betting
that
was
a
rash
remark
then
why
does
teddy
come
back
oh
well
you
know
i
hedged
you
can
never
be
quite
absolutely
sure
it
might
clear
up
they
bound
to
give
it
a
chance
until
the
afternoon
and
the
players
ca
leave
till
stumps
are
drawn
i
should
have
thought
teddy
could
have
come
home
to
lunch
said
miss
belsize
even
if
he
had
to
go
back
afterwards
i
should
wonder
if
he
did
come
said
i
conceiving
the
bare
possibility
and
with
him
do
you
mean
mr
raffles
yes
miss
belsize
he
the
only
that
counts
camilla
belsize
turned
slightly
in
the
to
which
she
had
confided
her
delicate
frock
and
our
eyes
met
almost
for
the
first
time
certainly
we
had
not
exchanged
so
long
a
look
before
for
she
had
been
watching
the
torpid
goldfish
in
the
rockery
pool
and
i
admiring
her
bold
profile
and
the
querulous
poise
of
a
fine
head
as
i
tried
to
argue
her
out
of
all
desire
for
lord
suddenly
our
eyes
met
as
i
say
and
hers
dazzled
me
they
were
soft
and
yet
brilliant
tender
and
yet
cynical
calmly
reckless
audaciously
sentimental
all
that
and
more
as
i
see
them
now
on
looking
back
but
at
the
time
i
was
merely
dazzled
so
you
and
raffles
are
great
friends
said
miss
belsize
harking
back
to
a
remark
of
garland
in
introducing
us
rather
i
replied
are
you
as
great
a
friend
of
his
as
teddy
is
i
liked
that
but
simply
said
i
was
an
older
friend
raffles
and
i
were
at
school
together
i
added
loftily
really
i
should
have
thought
he
was
before
your
time
no
only
senior
to
me
i
happened
to
be
his
fag
and
what
sort
of
a
schoolboy
was
mr
raffles
inquired
miss
belsize
not
by
any
means
in
the
tone
of
a
devotee
but
i
reflected
that
her
own
devotion
was
bespoke
and
not
improbably
tainted
with
some
little
jealousy
of
raffles
he
was
the
most
admirable
crichton
who
was
ever
at
the
school
said
i
captain
of
the
eleven
the
fastest
man
in
the
fifteen
athletic
champion
and
an
ornament
of
the
upper
sixth
and
you
worshipped
him
i
suppose
absolutely
my
companion
had
been
taking
renewed
interest
in
the
goldfish
now
she
looked
at
me
again
with
the
cynical
light
full
on
in
her
eyes
you
must
be
rather
disappointed
in
him
now
disappointed
why
i
asked
with
much
outward
amusement
but
i
was
beginning
to
feel
uncomfortable
of
course
i
do
know
much
about
him
remarked
miss
belsize
as
though
she
cared
less
but
does
anybody
know
anything
of
raffles
except
as
a
cricketer
i
do
said
i
with
injudicious
alacrity
well
said
miss
belsize
what
else
is
he
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
among
other
things
but
what
other
things
ask
teddy
i
said
unluckily
i
have
replied
miss
belsize
but
teddy
does
know
he
often
wonders
how
raffles
can
afford
to
play
so
much
cricket
without
doing
any
work
does
he
indeed
many
people
do
and
what
do
they
say
about
him
miss
belsize
hesitated
watching
me
for
a
moment
and
the
goldfish
rather
longer
the
rain
sounded
louder
and
the
fountain
as
though
it
had
been
turned
on
again
before
she
answered
more
than
their
prayers
no
doubt
do
you
mean
i
almost
gasped
as
to
the
way
raffles
gets
his
living
yes
you
might
tell
me
the
kind
of
things
they
say
miss
belsize
but
if
there
no
truth
in
them
i
soon
tell
you
if
there
is
or
not
but
suppose
i
do
care
either
way
said
miss
belsize
with
a
brilliant
smile
then
i
care
so
much
that
i
should
be
extremely
grateful
to
you
mind
i
do
believe
it
myself
mr
manders
you
do
believe
that
raffles
lives
by
his
wits
and
his
cricket
i
jumped
to
my
feet
is
that
all
they
say
about
him
i
cried
is
it
enough
asked
miss
belsize
astonished
in
her
turn
at
my
demeanour
oh
quite
enough
quite
enough
said
i
it
only
the
most
scandalously
unfair
and
utterly
untrue
report
that
ever
got
about
that
all
this
heavy
irony
was
of
course
intended
to
convey
the
impression
that
one
first
explosion
of
relief
had
been
equally
ironical
but
i
was
to
discover
that
camilla
belsize
was
never
easily
deceived
it
was
unpleasantly
apparent
in
her
bold
eyes
before
she
opened
her
firm
mouth
yet
you
seemed
to
expect
something
worse
she
said
at
length
what
could
be
worse
i
asked
my
back
against
the
wall
of
my
own
indiscretion
why
a
man
like
raffles
would
rather
be
any
mortal
thing
than
a
paid
amateur
but
you
have
told
me
what
he
mr
manders
and
you
have
told
me
miss
belsize
why
you
so
interested
in
after
all
i
retorted
getting
home
for
once
and
sitting
down
again
on
the
strength
of
it
but
miss
belsize
was
my
superior
to
the
last
in
the
single
moment
of
my
ascendency
she
made
me
blush
for
it
and
for
myself
she
would
be
quite
frank
with
me
my
friend
raffles
did
interest
her
rather
more
than
she
cared
to
say
it
was
because
teddy
thought
so
much
of
him
that
was
the
only
reason
and
her
one
excuse
for
all
inquisitive
questions
and
censorious
remarks
i
must
have
thought
her
very
rude
but
now
i
knew
raffles
had
been
such
a
friend
to
teddy
sometimes
she
wondered
whether
he
was
quite
a
good
friend
and
there
i
had
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
i
had
indeed
and
i
knew
the
nut
and
had
tasted
its
bitter
kernel
too
often
to
make
any
mistake
about
it
jealousy
was
its
other
name
but
i
did
not
care
how
jealous
miss
belsize
became
of
raffles
as
long
as
jealousy
did
not
beget
suspicion
and
my
mind
was
not
entirely
relieved
on
that
point
we
dropped
the
whole
subject
however
with
some
abruptness
and
the
rest
of
our
conversation
in
the
rockery
and
in
the
steaming
and
further
vineries
which
we
proceeded
to
explore
together
was
quite
refreshingly
tame
yet
i
think
it
was
on
this
desultory
tour
to
the
still
incessant
accompaniment
of
rain
on
the
glasshouses
that
mother
took
shape
in
my
mind
as
the
lady
laura
belsize
an
apparently
impecunious
widow
reduced
to
down
the
river
and
suburban
neighbours
whose
manners
and
customs
my
companion
hit
off
with
vivacious
intolerance
she
told
me
how
she
had
shocked
them
by
smoking
cigarettes
in
the
back
garden
and
pronounced
a
gratuitous
conviction
that
i
of
all
people
would
have
been
no
less
scandalised
that
was
in
the
uttermost
vinery
and
in
another
minute
two
sullivans
were
in
full
blast
under
the
vines
i
remember
discovering
that
the
great
brand
was
not
unfamiliar
to
miss
belsize
and
even
gathering
that
it
was
raffles
himself
who
had
made
it
known
to
her
raffles
whom
she
did
not
know
much
about
or
consider
quite
a
good
friend
for
teddy
garland
i
was
becoming
curious
to
see
this
antagonistic
pair
together
but
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
before
raffles
reappeared
though
garland
told
me
he
had
received
an
optimistic
note
from
him
by
special
messenger
earlier
in
the
day
i
felt
i
might
have
been
told
a
little
more
considering
the
intimate
part
i
was
already
playing
as
a
stranger
in
a
strange
house
but
i
was
only
too
thankful
to
find
that
raffles
had
so
far
infected
our
host
with
his
confidence
as
to
tide
us
through
luncheon
with
far
fewer
embarrassments
than
before
nor
did
garland
desert
us
again
until
the
butler
with
a
visitor
card
brought
about
his
abrupt
departure
from
the
conservatory
then
my
troubles
began
afresh
it
stopped
raining
at
last
if
miss
belsize
could
have
had
her
way
we
should
all
have
started
for
lord
that
minute
i
took
her
into
the
garden
to
show
her
the
state
of
the
lawns
coldly
scintillant
with
standing
water
and
rimmed
by
regular
canals
lord
would
be
like
them
only
fifty
times
worse
play
had
no
doubt
been
abandoned
on
that
quagmire
for
the
day
miss
belsize
was
not
so
sure
about
that
why
should
we
not
drive
over
and
find
out
i
said
that
was
the
surest
way
of
missing
teddy
she
said
a
hansom
would
take
us
there
and
back
in
a
i
gained
time
disputing
that
statement
but
said
if
we
went
at
all
i
was
sure
garland
would
want
to
go
with
us
and
that
in
his
own
brougham
all
this
on
the
crown
of
a
sloppy
path
and
when
miss
belsize
asked
me
how
many
more
times
i
was
going
to
change
my
ground
i
could
not
help
looking
at
her
absurd
shoes
sinking
into
the
softened
gravel
and
saying
i
thought
it
was
for
her
to
do
that
miss
belsize
took
my
advice
to
the
extent
of
turning
upon
a
submerged
heel
though
with
none
too
complimentary
a
smile
and
then
it
was
that
i
saw
what
i
had
been
curious
to
see
all
day
raffles
was
coming
down
the
path
towards
us
and
i
saw
miss
belsize
hesitate
and
stiffen
before
shaking
hands
with
him
they
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
at
last
said
he
i
just
come
from
lord
and
teddy
wo
be
very
long
why
did
you
bring
him
with
you
asked
miss
belsize
pertinently
well
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
the
worst
at
once
said
raffles
rather
lamely
for
him
and
then
a
man
playing
in
a
match
is
never
quite
his
own
master
you
know
still
he
ought
to
keep
you
waiting
much
longer
it
was
perhaps
unfortunately
put
at
any
rate
miss
belsize
took
it
pretty
plainly
amiss
and
i
saw
her
colour
rise
as
she
declared
she
had
been
waiting
in
the
hope
of
seeing
some
cricket
since
that
was
at
an
end
she
must
be
thinking
of
getting
home
and
would
just
say
to
garland
this
sudden
decision
took
me
as
much
by
surprise
as
i
believe
it
took
miss
belsize
herself
but
having
announced
her
intention
however
she
proceeded
to
action
by
way
of
the
conservatory
and
the
library
door
while
raffles
and
i
went
through
into
the
hall
the
other
way
i
afraid
i
put
my
foot
in
it
said
he
to
me
but
it
just
as
well
since
i
need
tell
you
there
no
sign
of
teddy
up
at
lord
have
you
been
there
all
day
i
asked
him
under
my
breath
except
when
i
went
to
the
office
of
this
rag
replied
raffles
brandishing
an
evening
paper
that
ill
deserved
his
epithet
see
what
they
say
about
teddy
here
and
i
held
my
breath
while
raffles
showed
me
a
stupendous
statement
in
the
column
it
was
to
the
effect
that
garland
eton
and
trinity
might
be
unable
to
keep
wicket
for
cambridge
after
all
owing
to
the
serious
illness
of
his
father
his
father
i
exclaimed
why
his
father
closeted
with
somebody
or
other
at
this
very
moment
behind
the
door
you
looking
at
i
know
bunny
i
seen
him
but
what
an
extraordinary
fabrication
to
get
into
a
decent
paper
i
do
wonder
you
went
to
the
office
about
it
you
wonder
still
less
when
i
tell
you
i
have
an
old
pal
on
the
staff
of
course
you
made
him
take
it
straight
out
on
the
contrary
bunny
i
persuaded
him
to
put
it
in
and
raffles
chuckled
in
my
face
as
i
have
known
him
chuckle
over
many
a
more
felonious
but
less
incomprehensible
exploit
did
you
see
bunny
how
bad
the
poor
old
boy
looked
in
his
library
this
morning
that
gave
me
my
idea
the
fiction
is
at
least
founded
on
fact
i
wonder
you
do
see
the
point
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
two
points
just
as
there
were
two
jobs
i
took
on
this
morning
one
was
to
find
teddy
and
the
other
was
to
save
his
face
at
lord
well
i
have
actually
found
him
yet
but
if
he
in
the
land
of
the
living
he
will
see
this
statement
and
when
he
does
see
it
even
you
may
guess
what
he
will
do
meanwhile
there
nothing
but
sympathy
for
him
at
lord
studley
could
have
been
nicer
a
place
will
be
kept
for
teddy
up
to
the
eleventh
hour
and
if
that
is
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
bunny
may
i
never
perform
the
feat
but
what
will
old
garland
say
a
he
has
already
said
bunny
i
told
him
what
i
was
doing
in
a
note
before
lunch
and
the
moment
i
arrived
just
now
he
came
out
to
hear
what
i
had
done
he
does
mind
what
i
do
so
long
as
i
find
teddy
and
save
his
face
before
the
world
at
large
and
miss
belsize
in
particular
look
out
bunny
here
she
is
the
excitement
in
his
whisper
was
not
characteristic
of
raffles
but
it
was
less
remarkable
than
the
change
in
camilla
belsize
as
she
entered
the
hall
through
the
as
we
had
done
before
her
for
one
moment
i
suspected
her
of
eavesdropping
then
i
saw
that
all
traces
of
personal
pique
had
vanished
from
her
face
and
that
some
anxiety
for
another
had
taken
its
place
she
came
up
to
raffles
and
me
as
though
she
had
forgiven
both
of
us
our
trespasses
of
two
or
three
minutes
ago
i
did
go
into
the
library
after
all
she
said
looking
askance
at
the
library
door
i
am
afraid
garland
is
having
a
trying
interview
with
somebody
i
had
just
a
glimpse
of
the
man
face
as
i
hesitated
and
i
thought
i
recognised
him
who
was
it
i
asked
for
i
myself
had
wondered
who
the
rather
mysterious
visitor
might
be
for
whom
garland
had
deserted
us
so
abruptly
in
the
conservatory
and
with
whom
he
was
still
conferring
in
the
hour
of
so
many
issues
i
believe
it
a
dreadful
man
i
know
by
sight
down
the
river
said
miss
belsize
and
hardly
had
she
spoke
before
the
library
door
opened
and
out
came
the
dreadful
man
in
the
portentous
person
of
dan
levy
the
usurer
of
european
notoriety
our
victim
of
the
morning
and
our
certain
enemy
for
life
chapter
vii
in
which
we
fail
to
score
levy
sailed
in
with
flying
shiny
hat
in
hand
he
was
evidently
prepared
for
us
and
raffles
for
once
behaved
as
though
we
were
prepared
for
levy
of
myself
i
can
not
speak
i
was
ready
for
a
terrific
scene
but
raffles
was
magnificent
and
to
do
our
enemy
justice
he
was
quite
as
good
they
faced
each
other
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
of
mutual
suavity
shot
with
underlying
animosity
on
the
one
side
and
delightful
defiance
on
the
other
not
a
word
was
said
or
a
tone
employed
to
betray
the
true
situation
between
the
three
of
us
for
i
took
my
cue
from
the
two
protagonists
just
in
time
to
preserve
the
triple
truce
meanwhile
garland
obviously
distressed
as
he
was
and
really
ill
as
he
looked
was
not
the
least
successful
of
us
in
hiding
his
emotions
for
having
expressed
a
grim
satisfaction
in
the
coincidence
of
our
all
knowing
each
other
he
added
that
he
supposed
miss
belsize
was
an
exception
and
presented
levy
forthwith
as
though
he
were
an
ordinary
guest
you
must
find
a
better
exception
than
this
young
lady
cried
that
worthy
with
a
certain
i
know
you
very
well
by
sight
miss
belsize
and
your
mother
lady
laura
into
the
bargain
really
said
miss
belsize
without
returning
the
compliment
at
her
command
the
bargain
muttered
raffles
to
me
with
sly
irony
the
echo
was
not
meant
for
levy
ears
but
it
reached
them
nevertheless
and
was
taken
up
with
adroit
urbanity
i
did
mean
to
use
a
trade
term
explained
the
jew
though
bargains
i
confess
are
somewhat
in
my
line
and
i
do
often
get
the
worst
of
one
raffles
when
i
do
the
other
fellow
usually
lives
to
repent
it
it
was
said
with
a
laugh
for
the
lady
benefit
but
with
a
gleam
of
the
eyes
for
ours
raffles
answered
the
laugh
with
a
much
heartier
one
the
look
he
ignored
i
saw
miss
belsize
beginning
to
watch
the
pair
and
only
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
over
which
garland
begged
her
to
preside
garland
seemed
to
have
an
anxious
eye
upon
us
all
in
turn
at
raffles
he
looked
wistfully
as
though
burning
to
get
him
to
himself
for
further
consultation
but
the
fact
that
he
refrained
from
doing
so
coupled
with
a
grimly
punctilious
manner
towards
the
gave
the
impression
that
his
son
whereabouts
was
no
longer
the
sole
anxiety
and
yet
remarked
miss
belsize
as
we
formed
a
group
about
her
in
the
firelight
you
seem
to
have
met
your
match
the
other
day
mr
levy
where
was
that
miss
belsize
somewhere
on
the
continent
was
it
it
got
into
the
newspapers
i
know
but
i
forget
the
name
of
the
place
do
you
mean
when
my
wife
and
i
were
robbed
at
carlsbad
i
was
holding
my
breath
now
as
i
had
not
held
it
all
day
raffles
was
merely
smiling
into
his
teacup
as
one
who
knew
all
about
the
affair
carlsbad
it
was
certified
miss
belsize
as
though
it
mattered
i
remember
now
i
do
call
that
meeting
your
match
said
the
an
unarmed
man
with
a
frightened
wife
at
his
elbow
is
no
match
for
a
desperate
criminal
with
a
loaded
revolver
was
it
as
bad
as
all
that
whispered
camilla
belsize
up
to
this
point
one
had
felt
her
to
be
forcing
the
unlucky
topic
with
the
best
of
intentions
towards
us
all
now
she
was
interested
in
the
episode
for
its
own
sake
and
eager
for
more
details
than
levy
had
a
mind
to
impart
it
makes
a
good
tale
i
know
said
he
but
i
shall
prefer
telling
it
when
they
got
the
man
if
you
want
to
know
any
more
miss
belsize
you
better
ask
raffles
was
in
our
hotel
and
came
in
for
all
the
excitement
but
it
was
just
a
trifle
too
exciting
for
me
and
my
wife
raffles
at
carlsbad
exclaimed
garland
miss
belsize
only
stared
yes
said
raffles
that
where
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
mr
levy
did
you
know
he
was
there
inquired
the
of
our
host
and
he
looked
sharply
at
raffles
as
garland
replied
that
this
was
the
first
he
had
heard
of
it
but
it
the
first
we
seen
of
each
other
sir
said
raffles
except
those
few
minutes
this
morning
and
i
told
you
i
only
got
back
last
night
but
you
never
told
me
you
had
been
at
carlsbad
raffles
it
a
sore
subject
you
see
said
raffles
with
a
sigh
and
a
laugh
is
it
mr
levy
you
seem
to
find
it
so
replied
the
moneylender
they
were
standing
face
to
face
in
the
firelight
each
with
a
shoulder
against
the
massive
and
camilla
belsize
was
still
staring
at
them
both
from
her
place
behind
the
and
i
was
watching
the
three
of
them
by
turns
from
the
other
side
of
the
hall
but
you
the
fittest
man
i
know
raffles
pursued
old
garland
with
terrible
tact
what
on
earth
were
you
doing
at
a
place
like
carlsbad
the
cure
said
raffles
there
nothing
else
to
do
there
is
there
mr
levy
levy
replied
with
his
eyes
on
raffles
unless
you
got
to
cope
with
a
who
steals
your
wife
jewels
and
then
gets
in
such
a
funk
that
he
practically
gives
them
back
again
the
emphasised
term
was
the
one
that
dan
levy
had
applied
to
raffles
and
myself
in
his
own
office
that
very
morning
did
he
give
them
back
again
asked
camilla
belsize
breaking
her
silence
on
an
eager
note
raffles
turned
to
her
at
once
the
jewels
were
found
buried
in
the
woods
said
he
out
there
everybody
thought
the
thief
had
simply
hidden
them
but
no
doubt
levy
has
the
better
information
levy
smiled
sardonically
in
the
firelight
and
it
was
at
this
point
i
followed
the
example
of
miss
belsize
and
put
in
my
one
belated
word
i
should
have
thought
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
swell
mob
in
the
wilds
of
austria
said
i
there
is
admitted
the
readily
but
your
true
mobsman
knows
his
whole
blooming
continent
as
well
as
piccadilly
circus
his
are
in
london
but
a
week
journey
at
an
hour
notice
is
nothing
to
him
if
the
swag
looks
worth
it
levy
necklace
was
actually
taken
at
carlsbad
for
instance
but
the
odds
are
that
it
was
marked
down
at
some
london
theatre
or
restaurant
eh
mr
raffles
i
afraid
i
ca
offer
an
expert
opinion
said
raffles
very
merrily
as
their
eyes
met
but
if
the
man
was
an
englishman
and
knew
that
you
were
one
why
did
he
bully
you
in
the
vulgar
tongue
who
told
you
he
did
cried
levy
with
a
sudden
grin
that
left
no
doubt
about
the
thought
behind
it
to
me
that
thought
had
been
obvious
from
its
birth
within
the
last
few
minutes
but
this
expression
of
it
was
as
obvious
a
mistake
who
told
me
anything
about
it
retorted
raffles
except
yourself
and
levy
your
gospels
clashed
a
little
here
and
there
but
both
agreed
that
the
fellow
threatened
you
in
german
as
well
as
with
a
revolver
we
thought
it
was
german
rejoined
levy
with
dexterity
it
might
been
or
chinee
for
all
i
know
but
there
was
no
error
about
the
revolver
i
can
see
it
covering
me
and
his
shooting
eye
looking
along
the
barrel
into
mine
as
plainly
as
i
looking
into
yours
now
mr
raffles
raffles
laughed
outright
i
hope
i
a
pleasanter
spectacle
levy
i
remember
your
telling
me
that
the
other
fellow
looked
the
most
colossal
so
he
did
said
levy
he
looked
a
good
deal
worse
than
he
need
to
have
done
his
face
was
blackened
and
disguised
but
his
teeth
were
as
white
as
yours
are
any
other
little
point
in
common
i
had
a
good
look
at
the
hand
that
pointed
the
revolver
raffles
held
out
his
hands
better
have
a
good
look
at
mine
his
were
as
black
as
his
face
but
even
yours
are
no
smoother
or
better
kept
well
i
hope
you
clap
the
bracelets
on
them
yet
mr
levy
you
get
your
wish
i
promise
you
mr
raffles
you
do
mean
to
say
you
spotted
your
man
cried
airily
i
got
my
eye
on
him
replied
dan
levy
looking
raffles
through
and
through
and
wo
you
tell
us
who
he
is
asked
raffles
returning
that
deadly
look
with
smiling
interest
but
answering
a
tone
as
deadly
in
one
that
maintained
the
note
of
persiflage
in
spite
of
daniel
levy
for
levy
alone
had
changed
the
key
with
his
last
words
to
that
point
i
declare
the
whole
passage
might
have
gone
for
banter
before
the
keenest
eyes
and
the
sharpest
ears
in
europe
i
alone
could
know
what
a
duel
the
two
men
were
fighting
behind
their
smiles
i
alone
could
follow
the
finer
shades
the
mutual
play
of
glance
and
gesture
the
subtle
tide
of
covert
battle
so
now
i
saw
levy
debating
with
himself
as
to
whether
he
should
accept
this
impudent
challenge
and
denounce
raffles
there
and
then
i
saw
him
hesitate
saw
him
reflect
the
crafty
coarse
emphatic
face
was
easily
read
and
when
it
suddenly
lit
up
with
a
baleful
light
i
felt
we
might
be
on
our
guard
against
something
more
malign
than
mere
reckless
denunciation
yes
whispered
a
voice
i
hardly
recognised
wo
you
tell
us
who
it
was
not
yet
replied
levy
still
looking
raffles
full
in
the
eyes
but
i
know
all
about
him
now
i
looked
at
miss
belsize
she
it
was
who
had
spoken
her
pale
face
set
her
pale
lips
trembling
i
remembered
her
many
questions
about
raffles
during
the
morning
and
i
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
i
was
the
only
entirely
understanding
witness
of
what
had
passed
here
in
the
firelit
hall
garland
at
any
rate
had
no
inkling
of
the
truth
yet
even
in
that
kindly
face
there
was
a
vague
indignation
and
distress
though
it
passed
almost
as
our
eyes
met
into
his
there
had
come
a
sudden
light
he
sprang
up
as
one
alike
rejuvenated
and
transfigured
there
was
a
quick
step
in
the
porch
and
next
instant
the
truant
teddy
was
in
our
midst
garland
met
him
with
outstretched
hand
but
not
a
question
or
a
syllable
of
surprise
it
was
teddy
who
uttered
the
cry
of
joy
who
stood
gazing
at
his
father
and
raining
questions
upon
him
as
though
they
had
the
hall
to
themselves
what
was
all
this
in
the
evening
papers
who
had
put
it
in
was
there
any
truth
in
it
at
all
none
teddy
said
garland
with
some
bitterness
my
health
was
never
better
in
my
life
then
i
ca
understand
it
cried
the
son
with
savage
simplicity
i
suppose
it
some
rotten
practical
joke
if
so
i
would
give
something
to
lay
hands
on
the
joker
his
father
was
still
the
only
one
of
us
he
seemed
to
see
or
could
bring
himself
to
face
in
his
distress
not
that
young
garland
had
the
appearance
of
one
who
had
been
through
fresh
vicissitudes
on
the
contrary
he
looked
both
trimmer
and
ruddier
than
overnight
and
in
his
sudden
fit
of
passionate
indignation
twice
the
man
that
one
remembered
so
humiliated
and
abased
raffles
came
forward
from
the
fireside
there
are
some
of
us
said
he
who
wo
be
so
hard
on
the
beggar
for
bringing
you
back
from
lord
at
last
you
must
remember
that
the
only
one
here
who
has
been
up
there
at
all
or
seen
anything
of
you
all
day
their
eyes
met
and
for
one
moment
i
thought
that
teddy
garland
was
going
to
repudiate
this
cool
and
tell
us
all
where
he
had
really
been
but
that
was
now
impossible
without
giving
raffles
away
and
then
there
was
his
camilla
in
evident
ignorance
of
the
disappearance
which
he
had
expected
to
find
common
property
the
double
circumstance
was
too
strong
for
him
he
took
her
hand
with
a
confused
apology
which
was
not
even
necessary
anybody
could
see
that
the
boy
had
burst
among
us
with
eyes
for
his
father
only
and
thoughts
of
nothing
but
the
report
about
his
health
as
for
miss
belsize
she
looked
as
though
she
liked
him
the
better
for
it
or
it
may
have
been
for
an
excitability
rare
in
him
and
rarely
becoming
his
pink
face
burnt
like
a
flame
his
eyes
were
brilliant
they
met
mine
at
last
and
i
was
warmly
greeted
but
their
friendly
light
burst
into
a
blaze
of
wrath
as
almost
simultaneously
they
fell
upon
his
bugbear
in
the
background
so
you
kept
your
threat
mr
levy
said
young
garland
quietly
enough
once
he
had
found
his
voice
i
generally
do
remarked
the
with
a
malevolent
laugh
his
threat
cried
garland
sharply
what
are
you
talking
about
teddy
i
will
tell
you
said
the
young
man
and
you
too
he
added
almost
harshly
as
camilla
belsize
rose
as
though
about
to
withdraw
you
may
as
well
know
what
i
am
while
there
time
i
got
into
debt
i
borrowed
from
this
man
you
borrowed
from
him
it
was
garland
speaking
in
a
voice
hard
to
recognise
with
an
emphasis
harder
still
to
understand
and
as
he
spoke
he
glared
at
levy
with
new
loathing
and
abhorrence
yes
said
teddy
he
had
been
pestering
me
with
his
beastly
circulars
every
week
of
my
first
year
at
cambridge
he
even
wrote
to
me
in
his
own
fist
it
was
as
though
he
knew
something
about
me
and
meant
getting
me
in
his
clutches
and
he
got
me
all
right
in
the
end
and
bled
me
to
the
last
drop
as
i
deserved
i
do
complain
so
far
as
i
concerned
it
serves
me
right
but
i
did
mean
to
get
through
without
coming
to
you
again
father
i
was
fool
enough
to
tell
him
so
the
other
day
that
was
when
he
threatened
to
come
to
you
himself
but
i
did
think
he
was
such
a
brute
as
to
come
or
such
a
fool
suggested
raffles
as
he
put
a
piece
of
paper
into
teddy
hands
it
was
his
own
original
promissory
note
the
one
we
had
recovered
from
dan
levy
in
the
morning
teddy
glanced
at
it
clutched
raffles
by
the
hand
and
went
up
to
the
as
though
he
meant
to
take
him
by
the
throat
before
us
all
does
this
mean
that
we
square
he
asked
hoarsely
it
means
that
you
are
replied
dan
levy
in
fact
it
amounts
to
your
receipt
for
every
penny
i
ever
owed
you
every
penny
that
you
owed
me
certainly
yet
you
must
come
to
my
father
all
the
same
you
must
have
it
both
ways
your
money
and
your
spite
as
well
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
said
levy
with
a
shrug
of
his
massive
shoulders
it
is
the
case
but
what
does
that
matter
so
long
as
you
no
said
teddy
through
his
teeth
nothing
matters
now
that
i
come
back
in
time
in
time
for
what
to
turn
you
out
of
the
house
if
you
do
clear
out
this
instant
the
great
gross
man
looked
upon
his
athletic
young
opponent
and
folded
his
arms
with
a
guttural
chuckle
so
you
mean
to
chuck
me
out
do
you
by
all
my
gods
if
you
make
me
levy
here
your
hat
there
the
door
and
never
you
dare
to
set
foot
in
this
house
again
the
took
his
shiny
topper
gave
it
a
meditative
polish
with
his
sleeve
and
actually
went
as
bidden
to
the
threshold
of
the
porch
but
i
saw
the
suppression
of
a
grin
beneath
the
pendulous
nose
a
cunning
twinkle
in
the
inscrutable
eyes
and
it
did
not
astonish
me
when
the
fellow
turned
to
deliver
a
parthian
shot
i
was
only
surprised
at
the
harmless
character
of
the
shot
may
i
ask
whose
house
it
is
were
his
words
in
themselves
notable
chiefly
for
the
aspirates
of
undue
deliberation
not
mine
i
know
but
i
the
son
of
the
house
returned
teddy
truculently
and
out
you
go
are
you
so
sure
that
it
even
your
father
house
inquired
levy
with
the
deadly
suavity
of
which
he
was
capable
when
he
liked
a
groan
from
garland
confirmed
the
doubt
implied
in
the
words
the
whole
place
is
his
declared
the
son
with
a
sort
of
nervous
scorn
freehold
and
everything
the
whole
place
happens
to
be
and
everything
replied
levy
spitting
his
iced
poison
in
separate
syllables
and
as
for
clearing
out
that
be
your
job
and
i
given
you
a
week
to
do
it
in
the
two
of
you
he
stood
a
moment
in
the
open
doorway
towering
in
his
triumph
glaring
on
us
all
in
turn
but
at
raffles
longest
and
last
of
all
and
you
need
think
you
going
to
save
the
old
man
came
with
a
passionate
hiss
like
you
did
the
son
i
know
all
about
you
chapter
viii
the
state
of
the
case
of
course
i
made
all
decent
haste
from
the
distressing
scene
and
of
course
raffles
stayed
behind
at
the
solicitation
of
his
unhappy
friends
i
was
sorry
to
desert
him
in
view
of
one
aspect
of
the
case
but
i
was
not
sorry
to
dine
quietly
at
the
club
after
the
alarms
and
excitements
of
that
disastrous
day
the
strain
had
been
the
greater
after
sitting
up
all
night
and
i
for
one
could
barely
realise
all
that
had
happened
in
the
hours
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
same
midsummer
night
and
day
should
have
seen
the
return
of
raffles
and
our
orgy
at
the
club
to
which
neither
of
us
belonged
the
dramatic
douche
that
saluted
us
at
the
albany
the
confessions
and
conferences
of
the
night
the
overthrow
of
the
in
the
morning
and
then
the
untimely
disappearance
of
teddy
garland
my
day
of
it
at
his
father
house
and
the
rain
and
the
ruse
that
saved
the
passing
situation
only
to
aggravate
the
crowning
catastrophe
of
the
triumph
over
raffles
and
all
his
friends
already
a
bewildering
sequence
to
look
back
upon
but
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
retrospect
to
reverse
the
order
of
things
and
it
was
the
new
risk
run
by
raffles
that
now
loomed
largest
in
my
mind
and
levy
last
word
of
warning
to
him
that
rang
the
loudest
in
my
ears
the
apparently
complete
ruin
of
the
garlands
was
still
a
profound
mystery
to
me
but
no
mere
mystery
can
hold
the
mind
against
impending
peril
and
i
was
less
exercised
to
account
for
the
downfall
of
these
poor
people
than
in
wondering
whether
it
would
be
followed
by
that
of
their
friend
and
mine
had
his
carlsbad
crime
really
found
him
out
had
levy
only
refrained
from
downright
denunciation
of
raffles
in
order
to
denounce
him
more
effectually
to
the
police
these
were
the
doubts
that
dogged
me
at
my
dinner
and
on
through
the
evening
until
raffles
himself
appeared
in
my
corner
of
the
with
as
brisk
a
step
and
as
buoyant
a
countenance
as
though
the
whole
world
and
he
were
one
my
dear
bunny
i
never
given
the
matter
another
thought
said
he
in
answer
to
my
nervous
queries
and
why
the
deuce
should
dan
levy
he
has
scored
us
off
quite
handsomely
as
it
is
he
not
such
a
fool
as
to
put
himself
in
the
wrong
by
stating
what
he
could
possibly
prove
they
would
listen
to
him
at
scotland
yard
it
not
their
job
in
the
first
place
and
even
if
it
were
no
one
knows
better
than
our
shylock
that
he
has
a
shred
of
evidence
against
me
still
said
i
he
happens
to
have
hit
upon
the
truth
and
that
half
the
battle
in
a
criminal
charge
then
it
a
battle
i
should
love
to
fight
if
the
odds
were
all
on
number
one
what
happens
after
all
he
recovers
his
property
he
not
a
pin
the
worse
off
but
because
he
has
a
row
with
me
about
something
else
he
thinks
he
can
identify
me
with
the
teutonic
thief
but
not
in
his
heart
bunny
he
not
such
a
fool
as
that
dan
levy
no
fool
at
all
but
the
most
magnificent
knave
i
been
up
against
yet
if
you
want
to
hear
all
about
his
tactics
come
round
to
the
albany
and
i
open
your
eyes
for
you
his
own
were
radiant
with
light
and
life
though
he
could
not
have
closed
them
since
his
arrival
at
charing
cross
the
night
before
but
midnight
was
his
hour
raffles
was
at
his
best
when
the
stars
of
the
firmament
are
at
theirs
not
at
lord
in
the
light
of
day
but
at
dead
of
night
in
the
historic
chambers
to
which
we
now
repaired
certainly
he
had
a
congenial
subject
in
the
celebrated
daniel
a
villain
after
my
own
black
heart
bunny
a
foeman
worthy
of
excalibur
itself
and
how
he
longed
for
the
fierce
joy
of
further
combat
for
a
bigger
stake
but
the
stake
was
big
enough
for
even
raffles
to
shake
a
hopeless
head
over
it
and
his
face
grew
grave
as
he
passed
from
the
fascinating
prowess
of
his
enemy
to
the
pitiful
position
of
his
friends
they
said
i
might
tell
you
bunny
but
the
figures
must
keep
until
i
have
them
in
black
and
white
i
promised
to
see
if
there
really
a
forlorn
hope
of
getting
these
poor
garlands
out
of
the
spider
web
but
there
is
bunny
i
do
mind
telling
you
what
i
ca
understand
said
i
is
how
father
and
son
seem
to
have
walked
into
the
same
parlour
and
the
father
a
business
man
just
what
he
never
was
replied
raffles
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
thing
he
was
born
into
a
big
business
but
he
was
born
a
business
man
so
his
partners
were
jolly
glad
to
buy
him
out
some
years
ago
and
then
it
was
that
poor
old
garland
lashed
out
into
the
place
where
you
spent
the
day
bunny
it
has
been
his
ruin
the
price
was
pretty
stiff
to
start
with
you
might
have
a
house
in
most
squares
and
quite
a
good
place
in
the
country
for
what
you
got
to
pay
for
a
cross
between
the
two
but
the
mixture
was
exactly
what
attracted
these
good
people
for
it
was
not
only
in
garland
time
but
it
seems
she
was
the
first
to
set
her
heart
upon
the
place
so
she
was
the
first
to
leave
it
for
a
better
world
poor
soul
before
the
glass
was
on
the
last
vinery
and
the
poor
old
boy
was
left
to
pay
the
shot
alone
i
wonder
he
did
get
rid
of
the
whole
show
said
i
after
that
i
no
doubt
he
felt
like
it
bunny
but
you
do
get
rid
of
a
place
like
that
in
five
minutes
it
neither
fish
nor
flesh
the
ordinary
with
the
money
to
spend
wants
to
be
nearer
in
or
further
out
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
good
reason
for
holding
on
that
part
of
kensington
is
being
gradually
rebuilt
old
garland
had
bought
the
freehold
and
sooner
or
later
it
was
safe
to
sell
at
a
handsome
profit
for
building
sites
that
was
the
one
excuse
for
his
dip
it
was
really
a
fine
investment
or
would
have
been
if
he
had
left
more
margin
for
upkeep
and
living
expenses
as
it
was
he
soon
found
himself
a
bit
of
a
beggar
on
horseback
and
instead
of
selling
his
horse
at
a
sacrifice
he
put
him
at
a
fence
that
brought
down
many
a
better
rider
what
was
that
south
africans
replied
raffles
succinctly
piles
were
changing
hands
over
them
at
the
time
and
poor
old
garland
began
with
a
lucky
dip
himself
that
finished
him
off
there
no
tiger
like
an
old
tiger
that
never
tasted
blood
before
our
respected
brewer
became
a
reckless
gambler
lashed
at
everything
and
in
due
course
omitted
to
cover
his
losses
they
were
big
enough
to
ruin
him
without
being
enormous
thousands
were
wanted
at
almost
a
moment
notice
no
time
to
fix
up
an
honest
mortgage
it
was
a
case
of
pay
fail
or
borrow
through
the
nose
and
old
garland
took
ten
thousand
of
the
best
from
dan
levy
and
had
another
dip
and
lost
again
and
lost
again
and
borrowed
again
this
time
on
the
security
of
his
house
and
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
he
and
every
stick
brick
and
branch
he
is
supposed
to
possess
have
been
in
dan
levy
hands
for
months
and
years
on
a
sort
of
mortgage
on
a
perfectly
nice
and
normal
mortgage
so
far
as
interest
went
only
with
a
power
to
call
in
the
money
after
six
months
but
old
garland
is
being
bled
to
the
heart
for
iniquitous
interest
on
the
first
ten
thousand
and
of
course
he
ca
meet
the
call
for
another
fifteen
when
it
comes
but
he
thinks
it
all
right
because
levy
does
press
for
the
dibs
of
course
it
all
wrong
from
that
moment
levy
has
the
right
to
take
possession
whenever
he
jolly
well
likes
but
it
does
suit
him
to
have
the
place
empty
on
his
hands
it
might
depreciate
a
rising
property
and
so
poor
old
garland
is
deliberately
lulled
into
a
false
sense
of
security
and
there
no
saying
how
long
that
state
of
things
might
have
lasted
if
we
had
taken
a
rise
out
of
old
shylock
this
morning
then
it
our
fault
it
mine
said
raffles
remorsefully
the
idea
i
believe
was
altogether
mine
bunny
that
why
i
give
my
bowing
hand
to
take
the
old
ruffian
at
his
word
and
save
the
governor
as
we
did
the
boy
but
how
you
account
for
his
getting
them
both
into
his
toils
i
asked
what
was
the
point
of
lending
heavily
to
the
son
when
the
father
already
owed
more
than
he
could
pay
there
are
so
many
points
said
raffles
they
love
you
to
owe
more
than
you
can
pay
it
not
their
principal
that
they
care
about
nearly
so
much
as
your
interest
what
they
hate
is
to
lose
you
when
once
they
got
you
in
this
case
levy
would
see
how
frightfully
keen
poor
old
garland
was
about
his
boy
to
do
him
properly
and
above
all
not
to
let
him
see
what
an
effort
it
become
levy
would
find
out
something
about
the
boy
that
he
getting
hard
up
himself
that
he
bound
to
discover
the
old
man
secret
and
capable
of
making
trouble
and
spoiling
things
when
he
does
give
him
the
same
sort
of
secret
of
his
own
to
keep
says
levy
they
both
hold
their
tongues
and
i
have
one
of
under
each
thumb
till
all
blue
so
he
goes
for
teddy
till
he
gets
him
and
finances
father
and
son
in
watertight
compartments
until
this
libel
case
comes
along
and
does
make
things
look
a
bit
blue
for
once
not
blue
enough
mind
you
to
compel
the
sale
of
a
big
rising
property
at
a
sacrifice
but
the
sort
of
thing
to
make
a
man
squeeze
his
small
creditors
all
round
while
still
nursing
his
top
class
so
you
see
how
it
all
fits
in
they
say
the
old
blackguard
is
briefing
attorney
himself
that
along
with
all
the
rest
to
scale
will
run
him
into
thousands
even
if
he
wins
his
case
may
he
lose
it
said
i
drinking
devoutly
while
raffles
lit
the
inevitable
egyptian
i
gathered
that
this
plausible
exposition
of
levy
tactics
had
some
foundation
in
the
disclosures
of
his
hapless
friends
but
his
ready
grasp
of
an
alien
subject
was
highly
characteristic
of
raffles
i
said
i
supposed
miss
belsize
had
not
remained
to
hear
the
whole
humiliating
story
but
raffles
replied
briefly
that
she
had
by
putting
the
words
into
his
mouth
i
now
learnt
that
she
had
taken
the
whole
trouble
as
finely
as
i
should
somehow
have
expected
from
those
fearless
eyes
of
hers
that
teddy
had
offered
to
release
her
on
the
spot
and
that
camilla
belsize
had
refused
to
be
released
but
when
i
applauded
her
spirit
raffles
was
ostentatiously
irresponsive
nothing
indeed
could
have
been
more
marked
than
the
contrast
between
his
reluctance
to
discuss
miss
belsize
and
the
captious
gusto
with
which
she
had
discussed
him
but
in
each
case
the
inference
was
that
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
pair
and
in
each
case
i
could
not
help
wondering
why
there
was
however
another
subject
upon
which
raffles
exercised
a
much
more
vexatious
reserve
had
i
been
more
sympathetically
interested
in
teddy
garland
no
doubt
i
should
have
sought
an
earlier
explanation
of
his
sensational
disappearance
instead
of
leaving
it
to
the
last
my
interest
in
the
escapade
however
was
considerably
quickened
by
the
prompt
refusal
of
raffles
to
tell
me
a
word
about
it
no
bunny
said
he
i
not
going
to
give
the
boy
away
his
father
knows
and
i
know
and
that
enough
was
it
your
paragraph
in
the
papers
that
brought
him
back
raffles
paused
cigarette
between
fingers
in
a
leonine
perambulation
of
his
cage
and
his
smile
was
a
sufficient
affirmative
i
must
talk
about
it
really
bunny
was
his
actual
reply
it
would
be
fair
i
do
think
it
conspicuously
fair
on
me
i
retorted
to
set
me
to
cover
up
your
pal
tracks
to
give
me
a
lie
like
that
to
act
all
day
and
then
not
to
take
one
into
the
secret
when
he
does
turn
up
i
call
it
trading
on
a
fellow
not
that
i
care
a
curse
then
that
all
right
bunny
said
raffles
genially
if
you
cared
i
should
feel
bound
to
apologise
to
you
for
the
very
rotten
way
you
been
treated
all
round
as
it
is
i
give
you
my
word
not
to
take
you
in
with
me
if
i
have
another
dip
at
dan
levy
but
you
not
seriously
thinking
of
it
raffles
i
am
if
i
see
half
a
chance
of
squaring
him
short
of
wilful
murder
you
mean
a
chance
of
settling
his
account
against
the
garlands
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
account
against
dan
levy
i
spoiling
for
another
round
with
that
sportsman
bunny
for
its
own
sake
quite
apart
from
these
poor
pals
of
mine
and
you
really
think
the
game
would
be
worth
a
candle
that
might
fire
the
secret
mine
of
your
life
and
blow
your
character
to
blazes
one
could
not
fraternise
with
raffles
without
contracting
a
certain
facility
in
fluent
and
florid
metaphor
and
this
parody
of
his
lighter
manner
drew
a
smile
from
my
model
but
it
was
the
bleak
smile
of
a
man
thinking
of
other
things
and
i
thought
he
nodded
rather
sadly
he
was
standing
by
the
open
window
he
turned
and
leant
out
as
i
had
done
that
interminable
hours
ago
and
i
longed
to
know
his
thoughts
to
guess
what
it
was
that
i
knew
he
had
not
told
me
that
i
could
not
divine
for
myself
there
was
something
behind
his
mask
of
gay
pugnacity
nay
there
was
something
behind
the
good
garlands
and
their
culpably
commonplace
misfortunes
they
were
the
pretext
but
could
they
be
the
cause
the
night
was
as
still
as
the
night
before
in
another
moment
a
flash
might
have
enlightened
me
but
in
the
complete
cessation
of
sound
in
the
room
i
suddenly
heard
one
soft
and
stealthy
but
quite
distinct
outside
the
door
chapter
ix
a
triple
alliance
it
was
the
intermittent
sound
of
cautious
movements
the
creak
of
a
sole
not
repeated
for
a
great
many
seconds
the
all
but
inaudible
passing
of
a
hand
over
the
unseen
side
of
the
door
leading
into
the
lobby
it
may
be
that
i
imagined
more
than
i
actually
heard
of
the
last
detail
nevertheless
i
was
as
sure
of
what
was
happening
as
though
the
door
had
been
yet
there
was
the
outer
door
between
lobby
and
landing
and
that
i
distinctly
remembered
raffles
shutting
behind
him
when
we
entered
unable
to
attract
his
attention
now
and
never
sorry
to
be
the
one
to
take
the
other
by
surprise
i
listened
without
breathing
until
assurance
was
doubly
sure
then
bounded
out
of
my
chair
without
a
word
and
there
was
a
resounding
knock
at
the
inner
door
even
as
i
flung
it
open
upon
a
special
evening
edition
of
daniel
levy
a
resplendent
figure
with
a
great
stud
blazing
in
a
frilled
shirt
white
waistcoat
and
gloves
and
cigar
and
all
the
other
insignia
of
a
nocturnal
vulgarian
about
town
may
i
come
in
said
he
with
unctuous
affability
may
you
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
shout
i
like
that
seeing
that
you
came
in
long
ago
i
heard
you
all
right
you
were
listening
at
the
door
probably
looking
through
the
keyhole
and
you
only
knocked
when
i
jumped
up
to
open
it
my
dear
bunny
exclaimed
raffles
a
reproving
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
he
bade
the
unbidden
guest
a
jovial
welcome
but
the
outer
door
was
shut
i
expostulated
he
must
have
forced
it
or
else
picked
the
lock
why
not
bunny
love
is
the
only
thing
that
laughs
at
locksmiths
remarked
raffles
with
exasperating
geniality
neither
are
swell
mobsmen
cried
dan
levy
not
more
ironically
than
raffles
only
with
a
heavier
type
of
irony
raffles
conducted
him
to
a
chair
levy
stepped
behind
it
and
grasped
the
back
as
though
prepared
to
break
the
furniture
on
our
heads
if
necessary
raffles
offered
him
a
drink
it
was
declined
with
a
crafty
grin
that
made
no
secret
of
a
base
suspicion
i
do
drink
with
the
swell
mob
said
the
my
dear
levy
returned
raffles
you
the
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
and
nobody
could
possibly
be
more
welcome
in
my
humble
quarters
but
that
the
fourth
time
i
heard
you
make
use
of
an
obsolete
expression
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
type
of
work
is
a
thing
of
the
past
where
are
the
jolly
dogs
of
the
old
song
now
at
the
albany
said
levy
here
in
your
rooms
raffles
well
bunny
said
raffles
i
suppose
we
must
both
plead
guilty
to
a
hair
of
the
jolly
dog
that
bit
him
eh
you
know
what
i
mean
our
visitor
ground
out
through
his
teeth
cracksmen
magsmen
mobsmen
the
two
of
you
so
you
may
as
well
both
own
up
to
it
cracksmen
magsmen
mobsmen
repeated
raffles
with
his
head
on
one
side
what
does
the
kind
gentleman
mean
bunny
wait
i
have
it
thieves
common
thieves
and
he
laughed
loud
and
long
in
the
moneylender
face
and
mine
you
may
laugh
said
levy
i
too
old
a
bird
for
your
chaff
the
only
wonder
is
i
did
spot
you
right
off
when
we
were
abroad
he
grinned
malevolently
shall
i
tell
you
when
i
did
tumble
to
it
ananias
j
raffles
daniel
in
the
liars
den
murmured
raffles
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
oh
yes
do
tell
us
anything
you
like
this
is
the
best
entertainment
we
had
for
a
long
time
is
it
bunny
chalks
said
i
i
thought
of
it
this
morning
proceeded
the
with
a
grim
contempt
for
all
our
raillery
when
you
played
your
pretty
trick
upon
me
so
glib
and
smooth
and
up
to
every
move
the
pair
of
you
one
borrowing
the
money
and
the
other
paying
me
back
in
my
very
own
actual
coin
well
said
i
there
was
no
crime
in
that
oh
yes
there
was
replied
levy
with
a
wide
wise
grin
there
was
the
one
crime
you
two
ought
to
know
better
than
ever
to
commit
if
you
call
yourselves
what
i
called
you
just
now
the
crime
that
you
committed
was
the
crime
of
being
found
out
but
for
that
i
should
never
have
suspected
friend
ananias
of
that
other
job
at
carlsbad
no
not
even
when
i
saw
his
friends
so
surprised
to
hear
that
he
been
out
there
a
strapping
young
chap
like
yes
cried
the
lifting
the
chair
and
jobbing
it
down
on
the
floor
this
morning
was
when
i
thought
of
it
but
this
afternoon
was
when
i
jolly
well
knew
raffles
was
no
longer
smiling
his
eyes
were
like
points
of
steel
his
lips
like
a
steel
trap
i
saw
what
you
thought
said
he
disdainfully
and
you
still
seriously
think
i
took
your
wife
necklace
and
hid
it
in
the
woods
i
know
you
did
then
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
alone
cried
raffles
why
did
you
bring
along
a
couple
of
good
men
and
true
from
scotland
yard
here
i
am
levy
entirely
at
your
service
why
do
you
give
me
in
charge
levy
chuckled
consumedly
ventriloquously
behind
his
three
gold
buttons
and
his
one
diamond
stud
i
not
such
a
bad
sort
as
you
think
said
he
an
you
two
gentlemen
are
not
such
bad
sorts
as
thought
gentlemen
once
more
eh
said
raffles
is
that
rather
a
quick
recovery
for
swell
magsmen
or
whatever
we
were
a
minute
ago
i
never
really
thought
you
quite
so
bad
as
all
that
mr
raffles
perhaps
you
never
really
thought
i
took
the
necklace
mr
levy
i
know
you
took
it
returned
levy
his
new
tone
of
crafty
conciliation
softening
to
a
semblance
of
downright
apology
but
i
believe
you
did
put
it
back
where
you
knew
it
be
found
and
i
begin
to
think
you
only
took
it
for
a
bit
o
fun
if
he
took
it
at
all
said
i
which
is
absurd
i
only
wish
i
had
exclaimed
raffles
with
gratuitous
audacity
i
agree
with
you
levy
it
would
have
been
more
like
a
bit
of
fun
than
anything
that
came
my
way
on
the
human
we
were
both
inhabiting
for
our
sins
the
kind
of
fun
that
appeals
to
you
suggested
levy
with
a
very
shrewd
glance
it
would
said
raffles
i
feel
sure
would
you
care
for
another
bit
o
fun
like
it
mr
raffles
do
say
please
well
would
you
like
to
try
your
at
the
game
again
not
levy
and
my
hand
if
you
do
mind
i
beg
pardon
my
mistake
said
levy
with
becoming
gravity
how
would
i
like
to
try
my
prentice
hand
on
picking
and
stealing
for
the
pure
fun
of
the
thing
is
that
it
mr
levy
raffles
was
magnificent
now
but
so
was
the
other
in
his
own
way
and
once
more
i
could
but
admire
the
tact
with
which
levy
had
discarded
his
favourite
cudgels
and
the
surprising
play
that
he
was
making
with
the
buttoned
foil
it
be
more
picking
than
stealing
said
he
tricky
picking
too
raffles
but
innocent
enough
even
for
an
amatoor
i
thank
you
levy
so
you
have
a
definite
case
in
mind
i
have
a
case
of
recovering
a
man
own
property
you
being
the
man
mr
levy
i
being
the
man
mr
raffles
bunny
i
begin
to
see
why
he
did
bring
the
police
with
him
i
affected
to
have
seen
it
for
some
time
thereupon
our
friend
the
enemy
protested
that
in
no
circumstances
could
he
have
taken
such
a
course
by
the
searchlight
of
the
present
he
might
have
detected
things
which
had
entirely
escaped
his
notice
in
the
past
incriminating
things
things
that
would
put
together
into
a
case
but
after
all
what
evidence
had
he
against
raffles
as
yet
levy
himself
propounded
the
question
with
unflinching
candour
he
might
inform
the
metropolitan
police
of
his
strong
suspicions
and
they
might
communicate
with
the
austrian
police
and
evidence
beyond
the
belated
evidence
of
his
own
senses
be
duly
forthcoming
but
nothing
could
be
done
at
once
and
if
raffles
cared
to
endorse
his
theory
of
the
practical
joke
by
owning
up
to
that
and
nothing
more
then
so
far
as
levy
was
concerned
nothing
should
ever
be
done
at
all
except
this
little
innocent
recovery
of
your
own
property
suggested
raffles
i
suppose
that
the
condition
condition
not
the
word
i
should
have
employed
said
levy
with
a
shrug
preliminary
then
indemnity
is
more
the
idea
you
put
me
to
a
lot
of
trouble
by
abstracting
levy
jewels
for
your
own
amusement
so
you
assert
mr
levy
well
i
may
be
wrong
that
remains
to
be
seen
or
not
as
you
decide
rejoined
the
jew
lifting
his
mask
for
the
moment
at
all
events
you
admit
that
it
the
sort
of
adventure
you
would
like
to
try
and
so
i
ask
you
to
amuse
yourself
by
abstracting
something
else
of
mine
that
to
have
got
into
the
wrong
hands
then
i
say
we
shall
be
quits
well
said
raffles
there
no
harm
in
our
hearing
what
sort
of
property
it
is
and
where
you
think
it
to
be
found
the
usurer
leant
forward
in
his
chair
he
had
long
been
sitting
in
the
one
which
at
first
he
had
seemed
inclined
to
wield
as
a
defensive
weapon
we
all
drew
together
into
a
smaller
triangle
and
i
found
our
visitor
looking
specially
hard
at
me
for
the
first
time
i
seen
you
too
before
said
he
i
thought
i
had
after
you
gone
this
morning
and
when
we
met
in
the
afternoon
i
made
sure
it
was
at
the
savoy
when
me
and
my
wife
were
dining
there
and
you
gentlemen
were
at
the
next
table
there
was
a
crafty
twinkle
in
his
eye
but
the
natural
allusion
to
the
necklace
was
not
made
i
suppose
he
continued
you
are
partners
in
amusement
otherwise
i
should
insist
on
speaking
to
raffles
alone
bunny
and
i
are
one
said
raffles
airily
though
two
to
one
numerically
speaking
remarked
levy
with
a
disparaging
eye
on
me
however
if
you
both
in
the
job
so
much
the
more
chance
of
bringing
it
off
i
daresay
but
you
never
to
a
lighter
swag
gentlemen
more
jewellery
inquired
raffles
as
one
thoroughly
enjoying
the
joke
no
lighter
than
that
a
letter
one
little
letter
that
all
of
your
own
writing
mr
levy
no
sir
thundered
the
just
when
i
could
have
sworn
his
lips
were
framing
an
affirmative
i
see
it
was
written
to
you
not
by
you
wrong
again
raffles
then
how
can
the
letter
be
your
property
my
dear
mr
levy
there
was
a
pause
the
was
at
visible
grips
with
some
new
difficulty
i
watched
his
heavy
but
not
unhandsome
face
and
timed
the
moment
of
mastery
by
the
sudden
light
in
his
crafty
eyes
they
think
it
was
written
by
me
said
he
it
a
forgery
written
on
my
office
paper
if
that
is
my
property
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
it
certainly
ought
to
be
returned
raffles
sympathetically
of
course
you
speaking
of
the
crucial
letter
in
your
case
against
i
am
said
levy
rather
startled
but
did
you
know
i
was
i
am
naturally
interested
in
the
case
and
you
read
about
it
in
the
papers
they
had
a
fat
sight
too
much
to
say
about
it
with
the
whole
case
still
i
read
the
original
articles
in
said
raffles
and
the
letters
i
supposed
to
have
written
yes
there
was
only
one
of
them
that
struck
me
as
being
slap
in
the
wind
eye
that
the
one
i
want
if
it
genuine
levy
it
might
easily
form
the
basis
of
a
more
serious
sort
of
case
but
it
is
genuine
nor
would
you
be
the
first
plaintiff
in
the
high
court
of
justice
pursued
raffles
blowing
soft
grey
rings
into
the
upper
air
who
has
been
rather
rudely
transformed
into
the
defendant
at
the
old
bailey
but
it
is
genuine
i
telling
you
cried
dan
levy
with
a
curse
then
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
with
the
letter
let
the
prosecution
love
and
cherish
it
and
trump
it
up
in
court
for
all
it
worth
the
less
it
is
worth
the
more
certain
to
explode
and
blow
their
case
to
bits
a
palpable
forgery
in
the
hands
of
mr
attorney
cried
raffles
with
a
wink
at
me
it
be
the
best
fun
of
its
kind
since
the
late
lamented
pigott
my
dear
bunny
we
must
both
be
there
levy
uneasiness
was
a
sight
for
timid
eyes
he
had
presented
his
case
to
us
naked
and
unashamed
already
he
was
in
our
hands
more
surely
than
raffles
was
in
his
but
raffles
was
the
last
person
to
betray
his
sense
of
an
advantage
a
second
too
soon
he
merely
gave
me
another
wink
the
usurer
was
frowning
at
the
carpet
suddenly
he
sprang
up
and
burst
out
in
a
bitter
tirade
upon
the
popular
and
even
the
judicial
prejudice
against
his
own
beneficent
calling
no
would
ever
get
justice
in
a
british
court
of
law
easier
for
the
camel
to
thread
the
needle
eye
that
flagrant
forgery
would
be
accepted
at
sight
by
our
vaunted
british
jury
the
only
chance
was
to
abstract
it
before
the
case
came
on
but
if
it
can
be
proved
to
be
a
forgery
urged
raffles
nothing
could
possibly
turn
the
tables
on
the
other
side
with
such
complete
and
instantaneous
effect
i
told
you
what
i
reckon
my
only
chance
said
levy
fiercely
let
me
remind
you
that
it
yours
as
well
if
you
talk
like
that
said
raffles
i
sha
consider
it
you
wo
in
any
case
i
should
hope
said
i
oh
yes
i
might
but
not
if
he
talks
like
that
levy
stopped
talking
quite
like
that
will
you
do
it
raffles
or
will
you
not
abstract
the
forgery
yes
where
from
wherever
it
may
be
their
solicitors
safe
i
suppose
who
are
the
solicitors
to
burroughs
and
burroughs
of
gray
inn
square
that
right
the
strongest
firm
in
england
for
a
criminal
case
said
raffles
with
a
grimace
at
me
their
is
probably
the
strongest
i
said
it
was
a
tricky
job
rejoined
the
moneylender
raffles
looked
more
than
dubious
big
game
for
a
first
shoot
eh
bunny
too
big
by
half
and
you
merely
wish
to
have
their
letter
withdrawn
mr
levy
that
the
way
to
put
it
and
the
diamond
stud
sparkled
again
as
it
heaved
upon
the
billows
of
an
intestine
chuckle
withdrawn
and
nothing
more
that
be
good
enough
for
me
mr
raffles
even
though
they
miss
it
the
very
next
morning
let
them
miss
it
raffles
joined
his
judicially
and
shook
his
head
in
serene
dissent
it
would
do
you
more
harm
than
good
levy
i
should
be
inclined
to
go
one
better
if
i
went
into
the
thing
at
all
he
added
with
so
much
point
that
i
was
thankful
to
think
he
was
beginning
to
decide
against
it
what
improvement
do
you
suggest
inquired
dan
levy
who
had
evidently
no
such
premonition
i
should
take
a
sheet
of
your
paper
with
me
and
forge
the
forgery
said
raffles
a
light
in
his
eye
and
a
gusto
in
his
voice
that
i
knew
only
too
well
but
i
should
do
my
work
as
perfectly
as
the
other
cove
did
his
my
effort
would
look
the
same
as
yours
until
attorney
fixed
it
with
his
eyeglass
in
open
court
and
then
the
bottom
would
be
out
of
the
defence
in
five
minutes
dan
levy
came
straight
over
to
raffles
quivering
like
a
jelly
beaming
at
every
pore
shake
he
cried
i
always
knew
you
were
a
man
after
my
own
heart
but
i
did
know
you
were
a
man
of
genius
until
this
minute
it
no
use
my
shaking
replied
raffles
the
tips
of
his
sensitive
fingers
still
together
until
i
make
up
my
mind
to
take
on
the
job
and
i
a
very
long
way
from
doing
that
yet
mr
levy
i
breathed
again
but
you
must
my
dear
friend
you
simply
must
said
levy
in
a
new
tone
of
pure
persuasion
i
was
sorry
he
forgot
to
threaten
instead
perhaps
it
was
not
forgetfulness
perhaps
he
was
beginning
to
know
his
raffles
as
i
knew
mine
if
so
i
was
sorrier
still
it
a
case
of
pro
said
raffles
calmly
you
ca
expect
me
to
break
out
into
downright
crime
however
technical
the
actual
offence
unless
you
make
it
worth
my
while
levy
became
the
man
i
wanted
him
to
be
again
i
fancy
it
worth
your
while
not
to
hear
anything
more
about
carlsbad
said
he
though
still
with
less
of
the
old
manner
than
i
could
have
wished
what
cried
raffles
when
you
own
yourself
that
you
no
evidence
against
me
there
evidence
is
to
be
got
that
may
mean
five
years
to
you
do
you
make
any
mistake
about
that
whereas
the
evidence
of
this
particular
letter
against
yourself
has
on
your
own
showing
already
been
obtained
it
as
you
like
of
course
added
raffles
getting
up
with
a
shrug
but
if
the
old
bailey
sees
us
both
levy
i
back
my
chance
against
yours
and
your
sentence
against
mine
raffles
helped
himself
to
a
drink
after
a
quizzical
look
at
his
guest
decanter
in
hand
the
usurer
snatched
it
from
him
and
splashed
out
half
a
tumbler
certainly
he
was
beginning
to
know
his
raffles
perilously
well
there
damn
you
said
he
blinking
into
an
empty
glass
i
trust
you
further
than
i
trust
any
other
young
blood
of
your
kidney
name
your
price
and
you
shall
earn
it
if
you
can
you
may
think
it
a
rather
long
one
mr
levy
never
mind
you
say
what
you
want
leave
that
money
of
yours
on
the
mortgage
with
garland
forgive
him
his
other
debt
as
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
and
either
that
letter
shall
be
in
your
hands
or
i
be
in
the
hands
of
the
police
before
a
week
is
up
spoken
from
man
to
man
with
equal
austerity
and
resolution
yet
in
a
voice
persuasive
and
conciliatory
rather
than
arbitrary
or
dictatorial
the
mere
form
and
manner
of
this
quixotic
undertaking
thrilled
all
my
fibres
in
defiance
of
its
sense
it
was
like
the
blare
of
bugles
in
a
dubious
cause
one
blood
responded
before
one
brain
and
but
for
raffles
little
as
his
friends
were
to
me
and
much
as
i
repudiated
his
sacrifices
on
their
behalf
that
very
minute
i
might
have
led
the
first
assault
on
their
oppressor
in
a
sudden
fury
the
savage
had
hurled
his
empty
tumbler
into
the
fireplace
and
followed
the
crash
with
such
a
volley
of
abuse
as
i
have
seldom
heard
from
human
brute
i
surprised
at
you
levy
said
raffles
contemptuously
if
we
copied
your
tactics
we
should
throw
you
through
that
open
window
and
i
stood
by
for
my
share
in
the
deed
yes
i
know
it
pay
you
to
break
my
neck
retorted
levy
you
rather
swing
than
do
time
would
you
and
you
prefer
the
other
alternative
said
raffles
to
loosing
your
grip
upon
a
man
who
done
you
no
harm
whatever
in
interest
alone
almost
repaid
all
you
lent
him
in
the
first
instance
you
security
for
the
rest
yet
you
must
ruin
him
to
revenge
yourself
upon
us
on
us
mark
you
it
against
us
you
got
your
grievance
not
against
old
garland
or
his
son
you
lost
sight
of
that
fact
that
little
trick
this
morning
was
our
doing
entirely
why
do
you
take
it
out
of
us
why
refuse
a
fair
offer
to
spite
people
who
have
done
you
no
harm
it
not
a
fair
offer
growled
levy
i
made
you
the
fair
offer
but
his
rage
had
moderated
he
was
beginning
to
listen
to
raffles
and
to
reason
with
however
ill
a
grace
it
was
the
very
moment
which
raffles
was
the
very
man
to
improve
levy
said
he
do
you
suppose
i
care
whether
you
hold
your
tongue
or
not
on
a
matter
of
mere
suspicion
which
you
ca
support
by
a
grain
of
evidence
you
lose
a
piece
of
jewellery
abroad
you
recover
it
intact
and
after
many
days
you
get
the
bright
idea
that
i
the
culprit
because
i
happen
to
have
been
staying
in
your
hotel
at
the
time
it
never
occurred
to
you
there
or
then
though
you
interviewed
the
gentleman
face
to
face
as
you
were
constantly
interviewing
me
but
as
soon
as
i
borrow
some
money
from
you
here
in
london
in
the
ordinary
way
you
say
i
must
be
the
man
who
borrowed
levy
necklace
in
that
extraordinary
way
at
carlsbad
i
should
say
it
to
the
marines
levy
if
i
were
you
they
the
only
force
that
are
likely
to
listen
to
you
i
do
say
it
all
the
same
and
what
more
you
do
deny
it
if
you
were
the
man
you
would
be
so
ready
for
another
game
like
it
now
ready
for
it
cried
raffles
more
than
ready
for
an
undeniable
point
i
always
your
man
for
a
new
sensation
levy
and
for
years
taken
an
academic
interest
in
the
very
fine
art
of
burglary
is
that
so
bunny
i
often
heard
you
say
so
i
replied
without
mishap
in
these
piping
times
continued
raffles
it
about
the
one
exciting
and
romantic
career
open
to
us
if
it
were
not
so
infernally
dishonest
i
should
have
half
a
mind
to
follow
it
myself
and
here
you
come
and
put
up
a
crib
for
me
to
crack
in
the
best
interests
of
equity
and
justice
not
to
enrich
the
wicked
cracksman
but
to
restore
his
rightful
property
to
the
honest
financier
a
sort
of
teetotal
felony
the
very
of
crime
is
that
a
beverage
to
refuse
a
chance
to
miss
a
temptation
to
resist
yet
the
risks
are
just
as
great
as
if
it
were
a
fine
old
fruity
felony
you
ca
expect
me
to
run
them
for
nothing
or
even
for
their
own
exciting
sake
you
know
my
terms
levy
if
you
do
accept
them
it
already
two
in
the
morning
and
i
should
like
to
get
to
bed
before
it
light
and
if
i
did
accept
them
said
levy
after
a
considerable
pause
the
letter
to
which
you
attach
such
importance
would
most
probably
be
in
your
possession
by
the
beginning
of
next
week
and
i
should
have
to
take
my
hands
off
a
nice
little
property
that
has
tumbled
into
them
only
for
a
time
said
raffles
on
the
other
hand
you
would
be
permanently
out
of
danger
of
figuring
in
the
dock
on
a
charge
of
blackmail
and
you
know
your
profession
is
popular
in
the
courts
levy
it
in
nearly
as
bad
odour
as
the
crime
of
blackmail
a
singular
docility
had
descended
like
a
mantle
upon
daniel
levy
no
uncommon
reaction
in
the
case
of
very
passionate
men
and
yet
in
this
case
ominous
sinister
and
completely
unconvincing
so
far
as
i
personally
was
concerned
i
longed
to
tell
raffles
what
i
thought
to
put
him
on
his
guard
against
his
obvious
superior
in
low
cunning
but
raffles
would
not
even
catch
my
eye
and
already
he
looked
insanely
pleased
with
himself
and
his
apparent
advantage
will
you
give
me
until
morning
said
levy
taking
up
his
hat
if
you
mean
the
morning
by
eleven
i
must
be
at
lord
say
ten
in
jermyn
street
it
a
strange
bargain
levy
i
should
prefer
to
clinch
it
out
of
earshot
of
your
clerks
then
i
will
come
here
i
shall
be
ready
for
you
at
ten
and
alone
there
was
a
sidelong
glance
at
me
with
the
proviso
you
shall
search
the
premises
yourself
and
seal
up
all
the
doors
meanwhile
said
levy
putting
on
his
hat
i
shall
think
about
it
but
that
all
i
have
agreed
yet
raffles
do
you
make
too
sure
that
i
ever
shall
i
shall
think
about
it
but
do
you
make
too
sure
he
was
gone
like
a
lamb
this
wild
beast
of
five
minutes
back
raffles
showed
him
out
and
down
into
the
courtyard
and
out
again
into
piccadilly
there
was
no
question
but
that
he
was
gone
for
good
back
came
raffles
rubbing
his
hands
for
joy
a
fine
night
bunny
a
finer
day
to
follow
but
a
nice
slow
wicket
if
ever
teddy
had
one
in
his
life
i
came
to
my
point
with
all
vehemence
confound
teddy
i
cried
from
my
heart
i
should
have
thought
you
had
run
risks
enough
for
his
sake
as
it
was
how
do
you
know
it
for
his
sake
or
anybody
asked
raffles
quite
hotly
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
be
beaten
by
a
brute
like
levy
garlands
or
no
garlands
besides
there
far
less
risk
in
what
i
mean
to
do
than
in
what
i
been
doing
at
all
events
it
in
my
line
it
not
in
your
line
i
retorted
to
strike
a
bargain
with
a
swine
who
wo
dream
of
keeping
his
side
i
shall
make
him
said
raffles
if
he
wo
do
what
i
want
he
have
what
he
wants
but
how
could
you
trust
him
to
keep
his
word
his
word
cried
raffles
in
ironical
echo
we
shall
have
to
carry
matters
far
beyond
his
word
of
course
deeds
not
words
bunny
and
the
deeds
properly
prepared
by
solicitors
and
executed
by
dan
levy
before
he
lays
a
finger
on
his
own
blackmailing
letter
you
remember
old
mother
hubbard
in
our
house
at
school
he
a
little
solicitor
somewhere
in
the
city
he
throw
the
whole
thing
into
legal
shape
for
us
and
ask
no
questions
and
tell
no
tales
you
leave
shylock
to
me
and
mother
and
we
bring
him
up
to
the
scratch
as
he
ought
to
go
there
was
no
arguing
with
raffles
in
such
a
mood
argue
i
did
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
what
i
said
he
had
unlocked
a
drawer
in
the
bureau
and
taken
out
a
map
that
i
had
never
seen
before
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
spread
it
out
in
the
light
of
his
and
it
was
a
map
of
london
capriciously
sprinkled
with
wheels
and
asterisks
of
red
ink
there
was
a
finished
wheel
in
bond
street
another
in
street
one
on
the
site
of
thornaby
house
park
lane
and
others
as
remote
as
john
wood
and
peter
street
campden
hill
the
asterisks
were
fewer
and
i
have
less
reason
to
remember
their
latitude
and
longitude
what
this
i
asked
it
looks
exactly
like
a
it
is
one
bunny
said
he
it
the
map
of
one
man
war
against
the
ordered
forces
of
society
the
spokes
are
only
the
scenes
of
future
operations
but
each
finished
wheel
marks
the
field
of
some
past
engagement
in
which
you
have
usually
been
the
one
man
one
and
only
accomplice
and
he
stooped
and
drew
the
neatest
of
asterisks
at
the
southern
extremity
of
gray
inn
square
chapter
x
my
raffles
right
or
wrong
the
historic
sward
had
just
been
cleared
for
action
when
raffles
and
i
met
at
lord
next
day
i
blush
to
own
i
had
been
knave
and
fool
enough
to
suggest
that
he
should
smuggle
me
into
the
pavilion
but
perhaps
the
only
laws
of
man
that
raffles
really
respected
were
those
of
the
and
it
was
in
block
that
he
joined
me
a
minute
or
so
before
eleven
the
sun
was
as
strong
and
the
sky
as
blue
as
though
the
disastrous
day
before
had
been
just
such
another
but
its
tropical
had
left
the
london
air
as
cleanly
and
as
clear
as
crystal
the
neutral
tints
of
every
day
were
splashes
of
vivid
colour
the
waiting
umpires
animated
the
heap
of
sawdust
at
either
end
a
pyramid
of
powdered
gold
upon
an
emerald
ground
and
in
the
expectant
hush
before
the
appearance
of
the
fielding
side
i
still
recall
the
yorkshire
accent
of
the
surrey
poet
hawking
his
latest
lyric
on
some
great
stand
by
webbe
and
stoddart
and
incidentally
assuring
the
crowd
that
cambridge
was
going
to
win
because
everybody
said
oxford
would
just
in
time
said
raffles
as
he
sat
down
and
the
cambridge
men
emerged
from
the
pavilion
capped
and
sashed
in
varying
shades
of
light
blue
the
captain
colours
were
bleached
by
service
but
the
were
the
newest
and
the
bluest
of
the
lot
and
as
a
male
historian
i
shrink
from
saying
how
well
they
suited
him
teddy
garland
looks
as
though
nothing
had
happened
was
what
i
said
at
the
time
as
i
peered
through
my
binocular
at
the
padded
figure
with
the
pink
face
and
the
gigantic
gloves
that
because
he
knows
there
a
chance
of
nothing
more
happening
was
the
reply
i
seen
him
and
his
poor
old
governor
up
here
since
i
saw
dan
levy
i
eagerly
inquired
as
to
the
upshot
of
the
earlier
interview
but
raffles
looked
as
though
he
had
not
heard
the
oxford
captain
had
come
out
to
open
the
innings
with
a
player
less
known
to
fame
the
first
ball
of
the
match
hurtled
down
the
pitch
and
the
oxford
captain
left
it
severely
alone
teddy
took
it
charmingly
and
almost
with
the
same
movement
the
ball
was
back
in
the
bowler
hands
all
right
muttered
raffles
with
a
long
breath
so
is
our
shylock
bunny
we
fixed
things
up
in
no
time
after
all
but
the
worst
of
it
is
i
shall
only
be
able
to
stop
he
broke
off
mouth
open
as
it
might
have
been
mine
a
ball
had
been
driven
hard
to
extra
cover
and
quite
well
fielded
another
had
been
taken
by
teddy
as
competently
as
the
first
but
not
returned
to
the
bowler
the
oxford
captain
had
played
at
it
and
we
heard
something
even
in
block
b
how
that
came
almost
simultaneously
in
teddy
ringing
voice
up
went
the
umpire
finger
and
down
came
raffles
hand
upon
my
thigh
he
caught
him
bunny
he
cried
in
my
ear
above
the
cambridge
cheers
the
best
bat
on
either
side
and
teddy
outed
him
third
ball
he
stopped
to
watch
the
defeated
captain
slow
return
the
demonstration
on
the
pitch
in
teddy
honour
then
he
touched
me
on
the
arm
and
dropped
his
voice
he
forgotten
all
his
troubles
now
bunny
if
you
like
nothing
going
to
worry
him
till
lunch
unless
he
misses
a
sitting
chance
and
he
wo
you
see
a
good
start
means
even
more
behind
the
sticks
than
in
front
of
raffles
was
quite
right
another
wicket
fell
cheaply
in
another
way
then
came
a
long
spell
of
plucky
cricket
a
stand
not
masterly
but
dogged
and
judicious
in
which
many
a
ball
outside
the
was
allowed
to
pass
unmolested
and
a
few
were
unfortunate
in
just
beating
the
edge
of
the
bat
on
the
tricky
wicket
teddy
work
was
cut
out
for
him
and
beautifully
he
did
it
it
was
a
treat
to
see
his
lithe
form
crouching
behind
the
bails
to
rise
next
instant
with
the
rising
ball
his
great
gloves
were
always
in
the
right
place
always
adhesive
once
only
he
held
them
up
prematurely
and
a
fine
ball
brushed
the
wicket
on
its
way
for
four
byes
it
was
his
sole
error
all
the
morning
raffles
sat
enchanted
so
in
truth
did
i
but
between
the
overs
i
endeavoured
to
obtain
particulars
of
his
latest
parley
with
dan
levy
and
once
or
twice
extracted
a
stray
detail
the
old
sinner
has
a
place
on
the
river
bunny
though
i
have
my
suspicions
of
a
second
establishment
nearer
town
but
i
to
find
him
at
his
lawful
home
all
the
next
few
nights
and
sitting
up
for
me
till
two
in
the
morning
then
you
going
to
gray
inn
square
this
week
i
going
there
this
morning
for
a
peep
at
the
crib
there
no
time
to
be
lost
but
on
the
other
hand
there
a
devil
of
a
lot
to
learn
i
say
bunny
there
going
to
be
another
change
of
bowling
the
fast
stuff
too
by
jove
a
massive
youth
had
taken
the
ball
at
the
top
end
and
the
was
retiring
to
a
more
respectful
distance
behind
the
stumps
you
let
me
know
when
it
to
be
i
whispered
but
raffles
only
answered
i
wonder
jack
studley
did
wait
till
there
was
more
of
a
crust
on
the
mud
pie
that
tripe
no
use
without
a
fast
wicket
the
technical
slang
of
the
modern
is
ever
a
weariness
at
the
moment
it
was
something
worse
and
i
resigned
myself
to
the
silent
contemplation
of
as
wild
an
over
as
ever
was
bowled
at
lord
a
shocking
thing
to
the
off
was
sent
skipping
past
point
for
four
tripe
muttered
raffles
to
himself
a
very
good
one
went
over
the
bails
and
thud
into
garland
gloves
like
a
well
bowled
said
raffles
with
less
reserve
another
delivery
was
merely
ignored
both
at
the
wicket
and
at
my
side
and
then
came
a
high
to
leg
which
the
batsman
hit
hard
but
very
late
it
was
a
hit
that
might
have
smashed
the
pavilion
palings
but
it
never
reached
them
it
stuck
in
teddy
left
glove
instead
and
none
of
us
knew
it
till
we
saw
him
staggering
towards
and
tossing
up
the
ball
as
he
recovered
balance
that
the
worst
ball
that
ever
took
a
wicket
in
this
match
vowed
a
reverend
veteran
as
the
din
died
down
and
the
best
catch
cried
raffles
come
on
bunny
that
my
for
the
day
there
would
be
nothing
to
compare
with
it
if
i
could
stop
to
see
every
ball
bowled
and
i
must
see
another
but
why
i
asked
as
i
followed
raffles
into
the
press
behind
the
carriages
i
already
told
you
why
said
he
i
got
as
close
to
him
as
one
could
in
that
crowd
you
not
thinking
of
doing
it
i
do
know
but
you
let
know
not
if
i
can
help
it
bunny
did
i
promise
not
to
drag
you
any
further
through
this
particular
mire
but
if
can
help
i
whispered
after
a
momentary
separation
in
the
throng
oh
if
i
ca
get
on
without
you
said
raffles
not
nicely
i
let
you
know
fast
enough
but
do
drop
the
subject
now
here
come
old
garland
and
camilla
belsize
they
did
not
see
us
quite
so
soon
as
we
saw
them
and
for
a
moment
one
felt
a
spy
but
it
was
an
interesting
moment
even
to
a
person
smarting
from
a
snub
the
ruined
man
looked
haggard
ill
unfit
to
be
about
the
very
embodiment
of
the
newspaper
report
concerning
him
but
the
spirit
beamed
through
the
shrinking
flesh
the
poor
old
fellow
was
alight
with
pride
and
love
exultant
in
spite
of
himself
and
his
misfortunes
he
had
seen
his
boy
great
catch
he
had
heard
the
cheers
he
would
hear
them
till
his
dying
hour
camilla
belsize
had
also
seen
and
heard
but
not
with
the
same
exquisite
appreciation
cricket
was
a
game
to
her
it
was
not
that
quintessence
and
epitome
of
life
it
would
seem
to
be
to
some
of
its
devotees
and
real
life
was
pressing
so
heavily
upon
her
that
the
trivial
consolation
which
had
banished
her
companion
load
could
not
lighten
hers
so
at
least
i
thought
as
they
approached
the
man
so
worn
and
radiant
the
girl
so
pensive
for
all
her
glorious
youth
and
beauty
his
was
the
old
head
bowed
with
sorrow
his
also
the
simpler
and
the
younger
heart
that
catch
will
console
me
for
a
lot
i
heard
him
say
quite
heartily
to
raffles
but
camilla
comment
was
altogether
perfunctory
indeed
i
wondered
that
so
sophisticated
a
person
did
not
affect
some
little
enthusiasm
she
seemed
more
interested
however
in
the
crowd
than
in
the
cricket
and
that
was
usual
enough
raffles
was
already
saying
he
must
go
with
an
explanatory
murmur
to
garland
who
clasped
his
hand
with
a
suddenly
clouded
countenance
but
miss
belsize
only
bowed
and
scarcely
took
her
eyes
off
a
couple
of
outwardly
inferior
men
who
had
attracted
my
attention
through
hers
until
they
also
passed
out
of
the
ground
garland
was
on
watching
the
game
again
with
mercurial
ardour
manders
will
look
after
me
she
said
to
him
wo
you
mr
manders
i
made
some
suitable
asseveration
and
she
added
garland
a
member
you
know
and
dying
to
go
into
the
pavilion
only
just
to
hear
what
they
think
of
teddy
the
poor
old
boy
confessed
and
when
we
had
arranged
where
to
meet
in
the
interval
away
he
hurried
with
his
keen
worn
face
miss
belsize
turned
to
me
the
moment
he
was
gone
i
want
to
speak
to
you
manders
she
said
quickly
but
without
embarrassment
where
can
we
talk
and
watch
as
well
i
suggested
thinking
of
the
young
man
at
his
best
behind
the
sticks
i
want
to
speak
to
you
first
she
said
where
we
sha
be
overheard
it
about
mr
raffles
added
miss
belsize
as
she
met
my
stare
about
raffles
again
about
raffles
after
all
that
she
had
learnt
the
day
before
i
did
not
enjoy
the
prospect
as
i
led
the
way
past
the
of
those
days
to
the
turned
for
the
nonce
into
a
tented
lawn
and
what
about
raffles
i
asked
as
we
struck
out
for
ourselves
across
the
grass
i
afraid
he
in
some
danger
replied
miss
belsize
and
she
stopped
in
her
walk
and
confronted
me
as
frankly
as
though
we
had
the
animated
scene
to
ourselves
danger
i
repeated
guiltily
enough
no
doubt
what
makes
you
think
that
miss
belsize
my
companion
hesitated
for
the
first
time
you
wo
tell
him
i
told
you
mr
manders
not
if
you
do
want
me
to
said
i
taken
aback
more
by
her
manner
than
by
the
request
itself
you
promise
me
that
certainly
then
tell
me
did
you
notice
two
men
who
passed
close
to
us
just
after
we
had
all
met
there
are
so
many
men
to
notice
said
i
to
gain
time
but
these
were
not
the
sort
one
expects
to
see
here
did
they
wear
bowlers
and
short
coats
you
did
notice
them
only
because
i
saw
you
watching
them
said
i
recalling
the
whole
scene
they
wanted
watching
rejoined
miss
belsize
dryly
they
followed
raffles
out
of
the
ground
so
they
did
i
reflected
aloud
in
my
alarm
they
were
following
you
both
when
you
met
us
the
dickens
they
were
was
that
the
first
you
saw
of
them
no
the
first
time
was
over
there
at
the
nets
before
play
began
i
noticed
those
two
men
behind
teddy
net
they
were
not
watching
him
that
called
my
attention
to
them
it
my
belief
they
were
lying
in
wait
for
raffles
at
any
rate
when
he
came
they
moved
away
but
they
followed
us
afterwards
across
the
ground
you
are
sure
of
that
i
looked
round
to
see
said
miss
belsize
avoiding
my
eyes
for
the
first
time
did
you
think
the
men
detectives
and
i
forced
a
laugh
i
was
afraid
they
might
be
manders
though
i
have
never
seen
one
off
the
stage
still
i
pursued
with
painfully
sustained
amusement
you
were
ready
to
find
raffles
being
shadowed
here
at
lord
of
all
places
in
the
world
i
was
ready
for
anything
anywhere
said
miss
belsize
after
all
i
heard
yesterday
afternoon
you
mean
about
poor
garland
and
his
affairs
it
was
an
ingenuously
disingenuous
suggestion
it
brought
my
eyes
back
to
mine
with
something
of
the
scorn
that
i
deserved
no
manders
i
meant
after
what
we
all
heard
between
levy
and
raffles
and
you
knew
very
well
what
i
meant
added
miss
belsize
severely
but
surely
you
did
take
all
that
seriously
said
i
without
denying
the
just
impeachment
how
could
i
help
it
the
insinuation
was
serious
enough
in
all
conscience
exclaimed
camilla
belsize
that
is
said
i
since
she
was
not
to
be
wilfully
misunderstood
that
poor
old
raffles
had
something
to
do
with
this
jewel
robbery
at
carlsbad
if
it
was
a
robbery
she
winced
at
the
word
do
you
mean
it
might
have
been
a
trick
said
i
recalling
the
own
at
the
albany
and
not
only
did
camilla
appear
to
embrace
that
theory
with
open
arms
she
had
the
nerve
to
pretend
that
it
really
was
what
she
had
meant
obviously
says
she
with
an
impromptu
superiority
worthy
of
raffles
himself
i
wonder
you
never
thought
of
that
manders
when
you
know
what
a
trick
you
both
played
levy
only
yesterday
raffles
himself
told
us
all
about
that
and
i
very
grateful
to
you
both
you
must
know
i
am
for
teddy
sake
added
miss
belsize
with
one
quick
remorseful
glance
towards
the
great
arena
still
it
only
shows
what
raffles
is
and
and
it
what
i
meant
when
we
were
talking
about
him
yesterday
i
do
remember
said
i
remembering
fast
enough
in
the
rockery
she
reminded
me
when
you
asked
what
people
said
about
him
and
i
said
that
about
living
on
his
wits
and
being
a
paid
amateur
but
the
other
was
the
worst
i
not
so
sure
said
i
but
his
wits
would
carry
him
very
far
if
he
only
took
necklaces
and
put
them
back
again
but
it
was
all
a
joke
she
reminded
us
both
with
a
bit
of
a
start
it
must
have
been
a
joke
if
raffles
did
it
at
all
and
it
would
be
dreadful
if
anything
happened
to
him
because
of
a
wretched
practical
joke
there
was
no
mistake
about
her
feeling
now
she
really
felt
that
it
would
be
dreadful
if
anything
happened
to
the
man
whom
yesterday
she
had
seemed
both
to
dislike
and
to
distrust
her
voice
vibrated
with
anxiety
a
bright
film
covered
the
fine
eyes
and
they
were
finer
than
ever
as
they
continued
to
face
me
unashamed
but
i
was
fool
enough
to
speak
my
mind
and
at
that
they
flashed
themselves
dry
i
thought
you
did
like
him
had
been
my
remark
and
who
says
i
do
was
hers
but
he
has
done
a
lot
for
teddy
she
went
on
and
never
more
than
yesterday
with
her
hand
for
an
instant
on
my
arm
when
you
helped
him
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
for
garland
sorrier
than
i
am
for
poor
teddy
but
raffles
is
more
than
sorry
i
know
he
means
to
do
what
he
can
he
seems
to
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
he
spoke
of
bringing
that
brute
to
reason
if
not
to
justice
it
would
be
too
dreadful
if
such
a
creature
could
turn
the
tables
on
raffles
by
trumping
up
any
charge
against
him
there
was
an
absolute
echo
of
my
own
tone
in
trumping
up
any
charge
and
i
thought
the
echo
sounded
even
more
insincere
but
at
least
it
showed
me
where
we
were
miss
belsize
was
not
deceived
she
only
wanted
me
to
think
she
was
miss
belsize
had
divined
what
i
knew
but
neither
of
us
would
admit
to
the
other
that
the
charge
against
raffles
would
be
true
enough
but
why
should
these
men
follow
him
said
i
really
wondering
why
they
should
if
there
were
anything
definite
against
old
raffles
do
you
think
he
would
be
arrested
oh
i
do
know
was
the
slightly
irritable
answer
i
only
think
he
should
be
warned
that
he
is
being
followed
whatever
he
has
done
i
ventured
yes
said
she
whatever
he
has
done
after
what
he
did
for
teddy
yesterday
you
want
me
to
warn
him
yes
but
not
from
me
and
suppose
he
really
did
take
levy
necklace
that
just
what
we
are
supposing
but
suppose
it
was
for
a
joke
at
all
i
spoke
as
one
playfully
plumbing
the
abysmally
absurd
what
i
did
desire
to
sound
was
the
loyalty
of
this
new
unexpected
and
still
captious
ally
and
i
thought
myself
strangely
successful
at
the
first
cast
for
miss
belsize
looked
me
in
the
face
as
i
was
looking
her
and
i
trusted
her
before
she
spoke
well
after
yesterday
she
said
i
should
warn
him
all
the
same
you
would
back
your
raffles
right
or
wrong
i
murmured
perceiving
that
camilla
belsize
was
after
all
like
all
the
rest
of
us
against
a
vulgar
extortioner
most
decidedly
she
returned
without
repudiating
the
possessive
pronoun
it
does
follow
that
i
think
anything
of
him
apart
from
what
you
did
between
you
for
teddy
yesterday
we
had
continued
our
stroll
some
time
ago
and
now
it
was
i
who
stood
still
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
still
wanted
some
minutes
to
the
luncheon
interval
if
raffles
took
a
cab
to
his
rooms
i
said
he
must
be
nearly
there
and
i
must
telephone
to
him
is
there
a
on
the
ground
only
in
the
pavilion
i
believe
for
the
use
of
the
members
then
you
must
go
to
the
nearest
one
outside
and
what
about
you
miss
belsize
brightened
with
her
smile
of
perfect
and
unconscious
independence
oh
i
shall
be
all
right
she
said
i
know
where
to
find
garland
even
if
i
do
pick
up
an
escort
on
the
way
but
it
was
she
who
escorted
me
to
the
tall
turnstile
nearest
wellington
road
and
you
do
see
why
i
want
to
put
raffles
on
his
guard
she
said
pointedly
as
we
shook
hands
it
only
because
you
and
he
have
done
so
much
for
teddy
and
because
she
did
not
end
by
reminding
me
of
my
promise
i
was
all
the
more
reluctantly
determined
to
keep
it
to
the
letter
even
though
raffles
should
think
as
ill
as
ever
of
one
who
was
at
least
beginning
to
think
better
of
him
chapter
xi
a
dash
in
the
dark
in
a
few
lines
which
i
found
waiting
for
me
at
the
club
and
have
somewhat
imprudently
preserved
raffles
professes
to
have
known
he
was
being
shadowed
even
before
we
met
at
lord
but
it
was
no
use
talking
about
it
until
the
foe
were
in
the
cart
he
goes
on
to
explain
the
simple
means
by
which
he
reduced
the
gentlemen
in
billycocks
to
the
pitch
of
discomfiture
implied
in
his
metaphor
he
had
taken
a
hansom
to
the
burlington
gardens
entrance
to
the
albany
and
kept
it
waiting
while
he
went
in
and
changed
his
clothes
then
he
had
sent
barraclough
to
pay
off
the
cab
and
himself
marched
out
into
piccadilly
what
time
the
billycock
brims
were
still
shading
watchful
eyes
in
burlington
gardens
there
to
be
sure
i
myself
had
spotted
one
of
the
precious
pair
when
i
drove
up
after
vain
exertions
at
the
outside
lord
but
by
that
time
his
confederate
was
on
guard
at
the
piccadilly
end
and
raffles
had
not
only
shown
a
clean
pair
of
wings
but
left
the
poor
brutes
to
watch
an
empty
cage
he
dismisses
them
not
unfairly
with
the
epithet
amateurish
thus
i
was
the
more
surprised
but
not
the
less
relieved
to
learn
that
he
was
running
down
into
the
country
for
the
weekend
to
be
out
of
their
way
but
he
would
be
back
on
the
monday
night
to
keep
an
engagement
you
wot
of
bunny
and
if
you
like
you
may
meet
me
under
the
clock
at
waterloo
in
flannel
kit
and
for
choice
at
the
witching
hour
of
twelve
sharp
if
i
liked
i
had
a
premature
drink
in
honour
of
an
invitation
more
gratifying
to
my
vanity
than
any
compliment
old
raffles
had
paid
me
yet
for
i
could
still
hear
his
ironical
undertaking
to
let
me
know
if
he
could
not
do
without
me
and
there
was
obviously
no
irony
in
this
delightfully
early
intimation
of
that
very
flattering
fact
it
altered
my
whole
view
of
the
case
i
might
disapprove
of
the
risks
raffles
was
running
for
his
other
friends
but
the
more
i
was
allowed
to
share
in
them
the
less
critical
i
was
inclined
to
be
besides
i
was
myself
clearly
implicated
in
the
issue
as
between
my
own
friend
and
the
common
enemy
it
was
no
more
palatable
to
me
than
it
was
to
raffles
to
be
beaten
by
dan
levy
after
our
initial
victory
over
him
so
i
drank
like
a
man
to
his
destruction
and
subsequently
stole
forth
to
spy
upon
his
foolish
myrmidons
who
flattered
themselves
that
they
were
spying
on
raffles
the
imbeciles
were
at
it
still
the
one
hanging
about
burlington
gardens
looked
unutterably
bored
but
with
his
blots
of
whisker
and
his
grimy
jowl
as
flagrant
a
detective
officer
as
ever
i
saw
even
if
he
had
not
so
considerately
dressed
the
part
the
other
bruiser
was
an
equally
distinctive
type
with
a
formidable
fighting
face
and
a
chest
like
a
barrel
but
in
piccadilly
he
seemed
to
me
less
occupied
in
taking
notice
than
in
avoiding
it
in
innocuous
futility
one
could
scarcely
excel
the
other
and
between
them
they
raised
my
spirits
to
the
zenith
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
at
their
own
game
dogging
miss
belsize
about
lord
until
at
last
i
had
an
opportunity
of
informing
her
that
raffles
was
quite
safe
it
may
be
that
i
made
my
report
with
too
much
gusto
when
my
chance
came
at
any
rate
it
was
only
the
fact
that
appeared
to
interest
miss
belsize
the
details
over
which
i
gloated
seemed
to
inspire
in
her
a
repugnance
consistent
with
the
prejudice
she
had
displayed
against
raffles
yesterday
but
not
with
her
grateful
solicitude
on
his
behalf
as
revealed
to
me
that
very
morning
i
could
only
feel
that
gratitude
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
her
new
regard
for
him
raffles
had
never
fascinated
this
young
girl
as
he
did
the
rest
of
us
ordinarily
engaged
to
an
ordinary
man
she
was
proof
against
the
glamour
that
dazzled
us
nay
though
she
would
not
admit
it
even
to
me
his
friend
though
like
levy
she
pretended
to
embrace
the
theory
of
the
practical
joke
making
it
the
pretext
for
her
anxiety
i
felt
more
certain
than
ever
that
she
now
guessed
and
had
long
suspected
what
manner
of
man
raffles
really
was
and
that
her
natural
antipathy
was
greater
even
than
before
still
more
certain
was
i
that
she
would
never
betray
him
by
word
or
deed
that
whatever
harm
might
come
of
his
present
proceedings
it
would
not
be
through
camilla
belsize
but
i
was
now
determined
to
do
my
own
utmost
to
minimise
the
dangers
to
be
a
real
help
to
raffles
in
the
act
of
altruistic
depravity
to
which
he
had
committed
himself
and
not
merely
a
fifth
wheel
to
his
dashing
chariot
accordingly
i
went
into
solemn
training
for
the
event
before
us
a
turkish
bath
on
the
saturday
a
quiet
sunday
between
mount
street
and
the
club
and
most
of
monday
lying
like
a
log
in
preparation
for
the
night
work
and
when
night
fell
i
took
it
upon
me
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
myself
before
meeting
raffles
at
waterloo
another
cool
and
starry
evening
seemed
to
have
tempted
all
the
town
and
his
wife
into
the
streets
the
great
streams
of
traffic
were
busier
than
ever
the
backwaters
emptier
and
gray
inn
a
basin
drained
to
the
last
dreg
of
visible
humanity
in
one
moment
i
passed
through
gateway
and
alley
from
the
voices
and
lights
of
holborn
into
a
perfectly
deserted
square
of
bare
ground
and
bright
stars
the
contrast
was
altogether
startling
for
i
had
never
been
there
before
but
for
the
same
reason
i
had
already
lost
my
bearings
believing
myself
to
be
in
gray
inn
square
when
i
was
only
in
south
square
gray
inn
here
i
entered
upon
a
hopeless
search
for
the
offices
of
burroughs
and
burroughs
door
after
door
had
i
tried
in
vain
and
was
beginning
to
realise
my
mistake
when
a
stray
molecule
of
the
population
drifted
in
from
holborn
as
i
had
done
but
with
the
quick
step
of
the
man
who
knows
his
way
i
darted
from
a
doorway
to
inquire
mine
but
he
was
across
the
square
before
i
could
cut
him
off
and
as
he
passed
through
the
rays
of
a
lamp
beside
a
second
archway
i
fell
back
thanking
providence
and
raffles
for
my
rubber
soles
the
man
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
me
but
at
the
last
moment
i
had
recognised
him
as
the
burlier
of
the
two
blockheads
who
had
shadowed
raffles
three
days
before
he
passed
under
the
arch
without
looking
round
i
flattened
myself
against
the
wall
on
my
side
of
the
arch
and
in
so
standing
i
was
all
but
of
a
sudden
encounter
in
the
square
beyond
the
quick
steps
stopped
and
there
was
a
here
you
are
on
one
side
and
a
well
where
is
he
on
the
other
both
very
eager
and
below
the
breath
on
the
job
whispered
the
first
voice
up
to
the
neck
when
did
go
in
nearly
an
hour
ago
when
i
sent
the
messenger
which
way
up
through
number
seventeen
next
door
eh
that
right
over
the
roof
ca
say
he
left
no
tracks
i
been
up
to
see
i
suppose
there
the
usual
ladder
and
trapdoor
yes
but
the
ladder
hanging
in
its
proper
place
he
could
have
put
it
back
there
could
he
the
other
grunted
presently
he
expressed
a
doubt
whether
raffles
and
it
thrilled
me
to
hear
the
very
name
had
succeeded
in
breaking
into
the
lawyer
office
at
all
the
first
man
on
the
scene
however
was
quite
sure
of
it
and
so
was
i
and
we
got
to
hang
about
grumbled
the
newcomer
till
he
comes
out
again
that
it
we
ca
miss
him
he
must
come
back
into
the
square
or
through
into
the
gardens
and
if
he
does
that
he
have
to
come
over
these
here
railings
into
field
court
we
got
him
either
way
and
a
step
just
here
where
we
can
sit
and
see
both
ways
as
though
it
had
been
made
for
us
you
come
and
try
a
door
into
the
old
hall
that
was
all
i
heard
distinctly
first
their
footsteps
and
then
the
few
extra
yards
made
the
rest
unintelligible
but
i
had
heard
enough
the
usual
ladder
and
those
blessed
words
alone
might
prove
worth
their
weight
in
great
letters
of
solid
gold
now
i
could
breathe
again
now
i
relaxed
my
body
and
turned
my
head
and
peered
through
the
arch
with
impunity
and
along
the
whole
western
side
of
gray
inn
square
with
its
dusky
fringe
of
and
its
vivid
line
of
lamps
its
strip
of
pavement
and
its
wall
of
houses
under
one
unbroken
roof
dim
lights
smouldered
in
the
column
of
landing
windows
over
every
door
otherwise
there
was
no
break
in
the
blackness
of
that
gaunt
fa√ßade
yet
in
some
dark
room
or
other
behind
those
walls
i
seemed
to
see
raffles
at
work
as
plainly
as
i
had
just
heard
our
natural
enemies
plotting
his
destruction
i
saw
him
at
a
safe
i
saw
him
at
a
desk
i
saw
him
leaving
everything
as
he
had
found
it
only
to
steal
down
and
out
into
the
very
arms
of
the
law
and
i
felt
that
even
that
desperate
was
little
more
than
he
deserved
for
letting
me
think
myself
accessory
before
the
fact
when
all
the
time
he
meant
me
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
well
i
should
have
everything
to
do
with
it
now
if
raffles
was
to
be
saved
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
insanity
i
and
i
alone
must
save
him
it
was
the
chance
of
my
life
to
show
him
my
real
worth
and
yet
the
difficulty
of
the
thing
might
have
daunted
raffles
himself
i
knew
what
to
do
if
only
i
could
gain
the
house
which
he
had
made
the
base
of
his
own
operations
at
least
i
knew
what
to
attempt
and
what
raffles
had
done
i
might
do
so
far
the
wily
couple
within
earshot
had
helped
me
out
of
their
own
mouths
but
they
were
only
just
round
the
corner
that
hid
them
from
my
view
stray
words
still
reached
me
and
they
knew
me
by
sight
would
recognise
me
at
a
glance
might
pounce
upon
me
as
i
passed
unless
had
it
the
crowd
in
holborn
seemed
strange
and
unreal
as
i
jostled
in
its
midst
once
more
i
was
out
of
it
in
a
moment
however
and
into
a
and
out
of
the
in
a
couple
of
minutes
by
my
watch
one
more
minute
and
i
was
seeing
how
far
back
i
could
sit
in
a
hansom
bound
for
gray
inn
square
i
forget
the
number
i
had
told
the
cabman
but
it
three
or
four
doors
beyond
burroughs
and
burroughs
the
solicitors
the
gate
into
holborn
had
to
be
opened
for
me
but
the
had
not
seen
me
on
my
previous
entrance
and
exit
afoot
through
the
postern
it
was
when
we
drove
under
the
further
arch
into
the
actual
square
that
i
pressed
my
head
hard
against
the
back
of
the
hansom
and
turned
my
face
towards
field
court
the
enemy
might
have
abandoned
their
position
they
might
meet
me
face
to
face
as
i
landed
on
the
pavement
that
was
my
risk
and
i
ran
it
without
disaster
we
passed
the
only
house
with
an
outer
door
to
it
in
the
square
now
there
is
none
and
on
the
plate
beside
it
i
read
burroughs
and
burroughs
with
a
thrill
up
went
my
stick
my
shilling
with
a
peculiarly
superfluous
sixpence
for
luck
i
thrust
through
the
trap
with
the
other
hand
and
i
was
across
the
pavement
and
on
the
stairs
four
clear
doors
beyond
the
lawyer
office
before
the
driver
had
begun
to
turn
his
horse
they
were
broad
bare
stairs
with
great
office
doors
right
and
left
on
every
landing
and
in
the
middle
the
landing
window
looking
out
into
the
square
i
waited
well
within
the
window
on
the
first
floor
and
as
my
hansom
drove
out
under
the
arch
the
light
of
its
near
lamp
flashed
across
two
figures
lounging
on
the
steps
of
that
entrance
to
the
hall
but
there
was
no
stopping
or
challenging
the
cabman
no
sound
at
all
but
those
of
hoofs
and
bell
and
soon
only
that
of
my
own
heart
beating
as
i
fled
up
the
rest
of
the
stairs
in
my
rubber
soles
near
the
top
i
paused
to
thank
my
kindly
stars
sure
enough
there
was
a
long
hanging
on
a
great
nail
over
the
last
and
a
square
right
over
the
landing
proper
i
ran
up
just
to
see
the
names
on
the
two
top
doors
one
was
evidently
that
of
some
pettifogging
firm
of
solicitors
while
the
other
bespoke
a
private
resident
whom
i
judged
to
be
out
of
town
by
the
congestion
of
postal
matter
that
met
my
fingers
in
his
neither
had
any
terrors
for
me
the
was
unhooked
without
another
moment
hesitation
care
alone
was
necessary
to
place
it
in
position
without
making
a
noise
then
up
i
went
and
up
went
the
trapdoor
next
without
mishap
or
hindrance
until
i
tried
to
stand
up
in
the
loft
and
caught
my
head
a
crack
against
the
tiles
instead
this
was
disconcerting
in
more
ways
than
one
for
i
could
not
leave
the
ladder
where
it
was
and
it
was
nearly
twice
my
height
i
struck
a
match
and
lit
up
a
sufficient
perspective
of
lumber
and
cobwebs
to
reassure
me
the
loft
was
long
enough
and
the
plumb
under
the
apex
of
the
roof
whereas
i
had
stepped
sideways
off
the
ladder
it
was
to
be
got
up
and
i
got
it
up
though
not
by
any
means
as
silently
as
i
could
have
wished
i
knelt
and
listened
at
the
open
for
a
good
minute
before
closing
it
with
great
caution
a
squeak
and
a
scuttle
in
the
loft
itself
being
the
only
sign
that
i
had
disturbed
a
living
creature
there
was
a
grimy
dormer
window
not
looking
down
into
the
square
but
leading
like
a
companion
hatchway
into
a
valley
of
once
red
tiles
now
stained
in
the
starlight
it
was
great
to
stand
upright
here
in
the
pure
night
air
out
of
sight
of
man
or
beast
smokeless
deleted
whole
pages
of
stars
but
put
me
more
in
mind
of
pollards
rising
out
of
these
rigid
valleys
and
sprouting
with
telephone
wires
that
interlaced
for
foliage
the
valley
i
was
in
ended
fore
and
aft
in
a
similar
slope
to
that
at
either
side
the
length
of
it
doubtless
tallied
with
the
frontage
of
a
single
house
and
when
i
had
clambered
over
the
southern
extremity
into
a
precisely
similar
valley
i
saw
that
this
must
be
the
case
i
had
entered
the
fourth
house
beyond
burroughs
and
burroughs
or
was
it
the
fifth
i
threaded
three
valleys
and
then
i
knew
in
all
three
there
had
been
dormer
windows
on
either
hand
that
on
the
square
side
leading
into
the
loft
the
other
or
others
forming
a
sort
of
skylight
to
some
room
suddenly
i
struck
one
of
these
standing
very
wide
open
and
trod
upon
a
rope
end
curled
like
a
snake
on
the
leads
i
stooped
down
and
at
a
touch
i
knew
that
i
had
hold
of
raffles
favourite
manila
which
united
a
silken
flexibility
with
the
strength
of
any
hawser
it
was
tied
to
the
and
it
dangled
into
a
room
in
which
there
was
a
dull
red
glow
of
fire
an
inhabited
room
if
ever
i
put
my
nose
in
one
my
body
must
follow
however
where
raffles
had
led
the
way
and
when
it
did
i
came
to
ground
sooner
than
i
expected
on
something
less
secure
the
dying
firelight
struggling
through
the
bars
of
a
kitchen
range
showed
my
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
table
a
cat
was
stretching
itself
on
the
as
i
made
a
step
of
a
wooden
chair
and
came
down
like
a
cat
myself
i
found
the
kitchen
door
found
a
passage
so
dark
that
the
window
at
the
end
hung
like
a
picture
slashed
across
the
middle
yet
it
only
looked
into
the
square
for
i
peered
out
when
i
had
crept
along
the
passage
and
even
thought
i
both
heard
and
saw
the
enemy
at
their
old
post
but
i
was
in
another
enemy
country
now
at
every
step
i
stopped
to
listen
for
the
thud
of
feet
bounding
out
of
bed
hearing
nothing
i
had
the
temerity
at
last
to
strike
a
match
upon
my
trousers
and
by
its
light
i
found
the
outer
door
this
was
not
bolted
nor
yet
shut
it
was
merely
ajar
and
so
i
left
it
the
rooms
opposite
appeared
to
be
an
empty
set
those
on
the
second
and
first
floors
were
only
partially
shut
off
by
swing
doors
leading
to
different
departments
of
the
mighty
offices
of
burroughs
and
burroughs
there
were
no
lights
upon
these
landings
and
i
gathered
my
information
by
means
of
successive
matches
whose
ends
i
carefully
concealed
about
my
person
and
from
copious
legends
painted
on
the
walls
thus
i
had
little
difficulty
in
groping
my
way
to
the
private
offices
of
sir
john
burroughs
head
of
the
celebrated
firm
but
i
looked
in
vain
for
a
layer
of
light
under
any
of
the
massive
mahogany
doors
with
which
this
portion
of
the
premises
was
glorified
then
i
began
softly
trying
doors
that
proved
to
be
locked
only
one
yielded
to
my
hand
and
when
it
was
a
few
inches
open
all
was
still
black
but
the
next
few
brought
me
to
the
end
of
my
quest
and
the
close
of
my
solitary
adventures
chapter
xii
a
midsummer
night
work
the
dense
and
total
darkness
was
broken
in
one
place
and
one
only
by
a
plateful
of
light
proceeding
from
a
tiny
bulb
of
incandescence
in
its
centre
this
blinding
atom
of
white
heat
lit
up
a
hand
hardly
moving
a
pen
continually
poised
over
a
disc
of
snowy
paper
and
on
the
other
side
something
that
lay
handy
on
the
table
reflecting
the
light
in
its
plated
parts
it
was
raffles
at
his
latest
deviltry
he
had
not
heard
me
and
he
could
not
see
but
for
that
matter
he
never
looked
up
from
his
task
sometimes
his
face
bent
over
it
and
i
could
watch
its
absolute
concentration
the
brow
was
furrowed
and
the
mouth
pursed
yet
there
was
a
hint
of
the
same
quiet
and
wary
smile
with
which
raffles
would
bowl
an
over
or
drill
holes
in
a
door
i
stood
for
some
moments
fascinated
entranced
before
creeping
in
to
warn
him
of
my
presence
in
a
whisper
but
this
time
he
heard
my
step
snatched
up
electric
torch
and
glittering
revolver
and
covered
me
with
the
one
in
the
other
light
i
gasped
bunny
he
exclaimed
in
equal
amazement
and
displeasure
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
this
you
in
danger
i
whispered
i
came
to
warn
you
danger
i
never
out
of
it
but
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
me
and
how
on
god
earth
did
get
here
i
tell
you
some
other
time
you
know
those
two
brutes
you
dodged
the
other
day
i
ought
to
they
waiting
below
for
you
at
this
very
moment
raffles
peered
a
few
moments
through
the
handful
of
white
light
between
our
faces
let
them
wait
said
he
and
replaced
the
torch
upon
the
table
and
put
down
his
revolver
for
his
pen
they
detectives
i
urged
are
they
bunny
what
else
could
they
be
what
indeed
murmured
raffles
as
he
fell
to
work
again
with
bent
head
and
deliberate
pen
you
gave
them
the
slip
on
friday
but
they
must
have
known
your
game
and
lain
in
wait
for
you
here
one
or
other
of
them
ever
since
it
my
belief
dan
levy
put
them
up
to
it
and
the
yarn
about
the
letter
was
just
to
tempt
you
into
this
trap
and
get
you
caught
in
the
act
he
did
want
a
copy
one
bit
for
god
sake
do
stop
to
finish
it
now
i
do
agree
with
you
said
raffles
without
looking
up
and
i
do
things
by
halves
your
precious
detectives
must
have
patience
bunny
and
so
must
you
he
held
his
watch
to
the
bulb
in
about
twenty
minutes
there
be
real
danger
but
we
could
be
safer
in
our
beds
for
the
next
ten
so
perhaps
you
let
me
finish
without
further
interruption
or
else
get
out
by
yourself
as
you
came
in
i
turned
away
from
raffles
and
his
light
and
blundered
back
to
the
landing
the
blood
boiled
in
my
veins
here
had
i
fought
and
groped
my
way
to
his
side
through
difficulties
it
might
have
taxed
even
him
to
surmount
as
one
man
swims
ashore
with
a
rope
from
the
wreck
at
the
same
mortal
risk
with
the
same
humane
purpose
and
not
a
word
of
thanks
not
one
syllable
of
congratulation
but
get
out
by
yourself
as
you
came
in
i
had
more
than
half
a
mind
to
get
out
and
for
good
nay
as
i
stood
and
listened
on
the
landing
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
outraged
heart
to
welcome
those
very
sleuthhounds
from
the
square
with
a
cordon
of
police
behind
them
yet
my
boiling
blood
ran
cold
when
warm
breath
smote
my
cheek
and
a
hand
my
shoulder
at
one
and
the
same
awful
moment
raffles
i
cried
in
a
strangled
voice
hush
bunny
he
chuckled
in
my
ear
did
you
know
who
it
was
i
never
heard
you
why
did
you
steal
on
me
like
that
you
see
you
not
the
only
one
who
can
do
it
bunny
i
own
it
would
have
served
me
right
if
you
brought
the
square
about
our
ears
have
you
finished
in
there
i
asked
gruffly
rather
then
you
better
hurry
up
and
put
everything
as
you
found
it
it
all
done
bunny
red
tape
tied
on
such
a
perfect
forgery
that
the
crux
will
be
to
prove
it
is
one
safe
locked
up
and
every
paper
in
its
place
i
never
heard
a
sound
i
never
made
one
said
raffles
leading
me
upstairs
by
the
arm
you
see
how
you
put
me
on
my
mettle
bunny
old
boy
i
said
no
more
till
we
reached
the
flat
at
the
top
of
the
house
then
i
begged
raffles
to
be
quiet
in
a
lower
whisper
than
his
own
why
bunny
do
you
think
there
are
people
inside
are
there
i
cried
aloud
in
my
relief
you
flatter
me
bunny
laughed
raffles
as
we
groped
our
way
in
this
is
where
they
keep
their
john
bulldog
a
magnificent
figure
of
a
commissionaire
with
the
itself
on
his
manly
bosom
catch
me
come
when
he
was
at
home
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
die
and
it
would
have
been
a
shame
either
way
poor
pussy
then
poor
puss
we
had
reached
the
kitchen
and
the
cat
was
rubbing
itself
against
raffles
legs
but
how
on
earth
did
you
get
rid
of
him
for
the
night
made
friends
with
him
when
i
called
on
friday
did
i
tell
you
i
had
an
appointment
with
the
bloated
head
of
this
notorious
firm
when
i
cleared
out
of
lord
i
about
to
strengthen
his
already
unrivalled
list
of
clients
you
shall
hear
all
about
that
later
we
had
another
interview
this
afternoon
when
i
asked
my
if
he
ever
went
to
the
theatre
you
see
he
had
spotted
tom
fool
and
told
me
he
never
had
a
chance
of
getting
to
lord
so
i
got
him
tickets
for
instead
but
of
course
i
swore
they
had
just
been
given
to
me
and
i
could
use
them
you
should
have
seen
how
the
hero
beamed
so
that
where
he
is
he
and
his
wife
or
was
until
the
curtain
went
down
good
lord
raffles
is
the
piece
over
nearly
ten
minutes
ago
but
it
take
all
that
unless
they
come
home
in
a
cab
and
raffles
had
been
sitting
before
the
fire
on
the
kitchen
table
encouraging
the
cat
when
this
formidable
and
his
wife
must
be
coming
every
instant
nearer
gray
inn
square
why
my
dear
bunny
i
should
back
myself
to
swarm
up
and
out
without
making
a
sound
or
leaving
a
sign
if
i
heard
our
hero
key
in
the
lock
this
moment
after
you
bunny
i
climbed
up
with
trembling
knees
raffles
holding
the
rope
taut
to
make
it
easier
once
more
i
stood
upright
under
the
stars
and
the
telephone
wires
and
leaned
against
a
to
wait
for
raffles
but
before
i
saw
him
before
i
even
heard
his
unnecessarily
noiseless
movements
i
heard
something
else
that
sent
a
chill
all
through
me
it
was
not
the
sound
of
a
key
in
the
lock
it
was
something
far
worse
than
that
it
was
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
roof
and
of
footsteps
drawing
nearer
through
the
very
next
valley
of
leads
and
tiles
i
was
crouching
on
the
leads
outside
the
dormer
window
as
raffles
climbed
into
sight
within
they
after
us
up
here
i
whispered
in
his
face
on
the
next
roof
i
hear
them
up
came
raffles
with
his
hands
upon
the
sill
then
with
his
knees
between
his
hands
and
so
out
on
into
the
narrow
rivulet
of
lead
between
the
sloping
tiles
out
of
the
opposite
slope
a
yard
or
two
on
rose
a
stout
stack
of
masonry
a
monster
with
a
on
each
and
a
full
supply
of
wires
for
whiskers
behind
this
gorgon
of
the
raffles
hustled
me
without
a
word
and
himself
took
shelter
as
the
muffled
voices
on
the
next
roof
grew
more
distinct
they
were
the
voices
that
i
had
overheard
already
in
the
square
the
voices
but
not
the
tones
the
tones
the
words
were
those
of
an
enemy
divided
against
itself
and
now
we
gone
and
come
too
far
grumbled
the
one
who
had
been
last
to
arrive
upon
the
scene
below
we
did
that
the
other
muttered
the
moment
we
came
in
after
we
should
stopped
where
we
were
with
that
other
cove
driving
up
and
going
in
without
ever
showing
a
glim
raffles
nudged
me
and
i
saw
what
i
had
done
but
the
weakling
of
the
pair
still
defended
the
position
he
had
reluctantly
abandoned
on
he
was
all
for
returning
while
there
was
time
and
there
were
fragments
of
the
broken
argument
that
were
beginning
to
puzzle
me
when
a
soft
oath
from
the
man
in
front
proclaimed
the
discovery
of
the
open
window
and
the
rope
we
got
he
whispered
stagily
like
rats
in
a
trap
you
forget
what
it
is
we
got
to
get
well
we
must
first
catch
our
man
must
we
and
how
d
know
his
pal
has
gone
in
to
warn
him
where
we
were
if
he
has
and
we
stopped
there
they
do
us
easy
they
may
do
us
easier
down
there
in
the
dark
replied
the
other
with
a
palpable
shiver
they
hear
us
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
dark
we
have
a
dog
chance
all
right
you
get
out
of
it
and
save
your
skin
i
rather
work
alone
than
with
a
blessed
funk
the
situation
was
identical
with
many
a
one
in
the
past
between
raffles
and
me
the
poor
brute
in
my
part
resented
the
charge
against
his
courage
as
warmly
as
i
had
always
done
he
was
merely
for
the
better
part
of
valour
and
how
right
he
was
raffles
and
i
only
knew
i
hoped
the
lesson
was
not
lost
upon
raffles
dialogue
and
action
alike
resembled
one
of
our
own
performances
far
more
than
ordinary
police
methods
as
we
knew
them
we
heard
the
squeeze
of
the
leader
clothes
and
the
rattle
of
his
buttons
over
the
window
ledge
it
like
old
times
we
heard
him
mutter
and
before
many
moments
the
weakling
was
impulsively
whispering
down
to
know
if
he
should
follow
i
felt
for
that
fellow
at
every
stage
of
his
unwilling
proceedings
i
was
to
feel
for
him
still
more
raffles
had
stepped
down
like
a
cat
from
behind
our
cover
grasping
an
angle
of
the
stack
with
either
hand
i
put
my
head
round
after
him
the
wretched
player
of
my
old
part
was
on
his
haunches
at
the
window
stooping
forward
more
in
than
out
i
saw
raffles
grinning
in
the
starlight
saw
his
foot
poised
and
the
other
poor
devil
disappear
then
a
dull
bump
then
a
double
crash
and
such
a
cursing
as
left
no
doubt
that
the
second
fellow
had
fallen
plumb
on
top
of
the
first
also
from
his
language
i
fancied
he
would
survive
the
fall
but
raffles
took
no
peep
at
his
handiwork
hardly
had
the
rope
whipped
out
at
my
feet
than
he
had
untied
the
other
end
like
lamplighters
bunny
and
back
we
went
along
the
valleys
of
lead
and
over
the
hills
of
tile
the
noise
in
the
kitchen
died
away
as
we
put
a
roof
or
two
between
us
and
that
of
burroughs
and
burroughs
this
is
where
i
came
out
i
called
to
raffles
as
he
passed
the
place
there
a
ladder
here
where
i
left
it
in
the
loft
no
time
for
ladders
cried
raffles
over
his
shoulder
and
not
for
some
moments
did
he
stop
in
his
stride
nor
was
it
i
who
stopped
him
then
it
was
a
sudden
hubbub
somewhere
behind
us
somewhere
below
the
blowing
of
a
police
whistle
and
the
sound
of
many
footsteps
in
the
square
that
for
us
i
gasped
the
ladder
the
ladder
ladder
be
damned
returned
raffles
roughly
it
is
for
us
at
all
it
my
pal
the
who
has
come
home
and
bottled
the
other
blighters
thinking
they
thieves
thinking
any
rot
you
like
our
course
is
over
the
rest
of
the
roofs
on
this
side
over
the
whole
lot
at
the
top
end
and
if
possible
down
the
last
staircase
in
the
corner
then
we
only
have
to
show
ourselves
in
the
square
for
a
tick
before
we
out
by
way
of
verulam
buildings
is
there
another
gate
there
i
asked
as
he
scampered
on
with
me
after
him
yes
but
it
closed
and
the
porter
leaves
at
twelve
and
it
must
be
jolly
near
that
now
wait
bunny
some
one
or
other
is
sure
to
be
looking
out
of
the
top
windows
across
the
square
they
see
us
if
we
take
our
fences
too
freely
we
had
come
to
one
of
the
transverse
which
hitherto
we
had
run
boldly
up
and
down
in
our
helpful
and
noiseless
rubber
soles
now
not
to
show
ourselves
against
the
stars
to
a
stray
pair
of
eyes
on
some
other
high
level
we
crept
up
on
all
fours
and
rolled
over
at
full
length
it
added
considerably
to
our
time
over
more
than
a
whole
side
of
the
square
meanwhile
the
police
whistles
had
stopped
but
the
company
in
the
square
had
swollen
audibly
it
seemed
an
age
but
i
suppose
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
we
came
to
the
last
of
the
dormer
windows
looking
into
the
last
vale
of
tiles
in
the
angle
of
the
square
something
gleamed
in
the
starlight
there
was
a
sharp
little
sound
of
splitting
wood
and
raffles
led
me
on
hands
and
knees
into
just
such
a
loft
as
i
had
entered
before
by
ladder
his
electric
torch
discovered
the
trapdoor
at
a
gleam
raffles
opened
it
and
let
down
the
rope
only
to
whisk
it
up
again
so
smartly
that
it
struck
my
face
like
a
whiplash
a
door
had
opened
on
the
top
landing
we
listened
over
the
open
and
knew
that
another
stood
listening
on
the
invisible
threshold
underneath
then
we
saw
him
running
downstairs
and
my
heart
leapt
for
he
never
once
looked
up
i
can
see
him
still
foreshortened
by
our
view
into
a
turkish
fez
and
a
fringe
of
white
hair
and
red
neck
a
billow
of
and
bare
heels
peeping
out
of
bedroom
slippers
at
every
step
that
we
could
follow
but
no
face
all
the
way
down
because
he
was
a
bent
old
boy
who
never
looked
like
looking
up
raffles
threw
his
rope
aside
gave
me
his
hand
instead
and
dropped
me
on
the
landing
like
a
feather
dropping
after
me
without
a
moment
pause
in
fact
the
old
fellow
with
the
fez
could
hardly
have
completed
his
descent
of
the
stairs
when
we
began
ours
yet
through
the
landing
window
we
saw
him
charging
diagonally
across
the
square
shouting
and
gesticulating
in
his
flight
to
the
gathering
crowd
near
the
far
corner
he
spotted
us
bunny
exclaimed
raffles
after
listening
an
instant
in
the
entrance
stick
to
me
like
my
shadow
and
do
every
blessed
thing
i
do
out
he
dived
i
after
him
and
round
to
the
left
with
the
speed
of
lightning
but
apparently
not
without
the
lightning
attribute
of
attracting
attention
to
itself
there
was
a
hullabaloo
across
the
square
behind
us
and
i
looked
round
to
see
the
crowd
there
breaking
in
our
direction
as
i
rushed
after
raffles
under
an
arch
and
up
the
alley
in
front
of
verulam
buildings
it
was
striking
midnight
as
we
made
our
sprint
along
this
alley
and
at
the
far
end
the
porter
was
preparing
to
depart
but
he
waited
to
let
us
through
the
gate
into
gray
inn
road
and
not
until
he
had
done
so
can
the
hounds
have
entered
the
straight
we
did
not
hear
them
till
the
gate
had
clanged
behind
us
nor
had
it
opened
again
before
we
were
high
and
dry
in
a
hansom
king
cross
roared
raffles
for
all
the
street
to
hear
but
before
we
reached
clerkenwell
road
he
said
he
meant
waterloo
and
round
we
went
to
the
right
along
the
i
was
too
breathless
to
ask
questions
and
raffles
offered
no
explanations
until
he
had
lit
a
sullivan
that
little
bit
of
wrong
way
may
lose
us
our
train
he
said
as
he
puffed
the
first
cloud
but
it
shoot
the
whole
field
to
king
cross
as
sure
as
scent
is
scent
and
if
we
do
catch
our
train
bunny
we
shall
have
it
to
ourselves
as
far
as
this
pack
is
concerned
hurrah
blackfriar
bridge
and
a
good
five
minutes
to
go
you
going
straight
down
to
levy
with
the
letter
yes
that
why
i
wanted
you
to
meet
me
under
the
clock
at
twelve
but
why
in
i
asked
recalling
the
injunctions
in
his
note
and
the
meaning
that
i
had
naturally
read
into
them
i
thought
we
might
possibly
finish
the
night
on
the
river
replied
raffles
darkly
i
think
so
still
and
thought
you
meant
me
to
lend
you
a
hand
in
gray
inn
raffles
laughed
the
less
you
think
my
dear
old
bunny
the
better
it
always
is
for
example
you
have
performed
prodigies
on
my
account
your
unselfish
audacity
has
only
been
equalled
by
your
resource
but
my
dear
fellow
it
was
a
sadly
unnecessary
effort
unnecessary
to
tell
you
those
brutes
were
waiting
for
you
down
below
quite
bunny
i
saw
one
of
them
and
let
him
see
me
i
knew
he
send
off
for
his
pal
then
i
do
understand
your
tactics
or
theirs
mine
were
to
walk
out
the
very
way
we
did
you
and
i
they
would
never
have
seen
me
from
the
opposite
corner
of
the
square
or
dreamt
of
going
in
after
me
if
they
had
spotted
your
getting
in
before
them
to
put
me
on
my
guard
the
place
would
have
been
left
exactly
as
i
found
it
and
those
two
numskulls
as
much
in
the
lurch
as
i
left
them
last
week
outside
the
albany
perhaps
they
were
beginning
to
fear
that
said
i
and
meant
ferreting
for
you
in
any
case
if
you
did
show
up
not
they
said
raffles
one
of
them
was
against
it
as
it
was
it
was
their
job
at
all
not
to
take
you
in
the
act
if
they
could
no
their
job
was
to
take
the
letter
from
me
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
earth
that
was
all
i
happen
to
know
those
were
their
instructions
from
old
levy
levy
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
i
was
being
dogged
by
his
creatures
his
creatures
raffles
he
set
them
to
shadow
me
from
the
hour
of
our
interview
on
saturday
morning
their
instructions
were
to
bag
the
letter
from
me
as
soon
as
i
got
it
but
to
let
me
go
free
to
the
devil
how
can
you
know
my
dear
bunny
where
do
you
suppose
i
been
spending
the
did
you
think
i
go
in
with
a
sly
dog
like
old
shylock
without
watching
him
and
finding
out
his
real
game
i
should
have
thought
it
hardly
necessary
to
tell
you
i
been
down
the
river
all
the
time
down
the
river
added
raffles
chuckling
in
a
canadian
canoe
and
a
torpedo
beard
i
was
cruising
near
the
foot
of
the
old
brute
garden
on
friday
evening
when
one
of
the
precious
pair
came
down
to
tell
him
they
had
let
me
slip
already
i
landed
and
heard
the
whole
thing
through
the
window
of
the
room
where
we
shall
find
him
it
was
levy
who
set
them
to
watch
the
crib
since
they
lost
the
cracksman
he
was
good
enough
to
reiterate
all
his
orders
for
my
benefit
you
will
hear
me
take
him
through
them
when
we
get
down
there
so
it
no
use
going
over
the
same
ground
twice
funny
orders
for
a
couple
of
scotland
yard
detectives
was
my
puzzled
comment
as
raffles
produced
an
inordinate
scotland
yard
said
he
my
good
bunny
those
were
no
limbs
of
the
law
they
old
thieves
set
to
catch
a
thief
and
they
been
caught
themselves
for
their
pains
of
course
they
were
every
detail
of
their
appearance
and
their
behaviour
confirmed
the
statement
in
the
flash
that
brought
them
all
before
my
mind
and
i
had
never
thought
of
it
never
but
dreamt
that
we
were
doing
battle
with
the
archenemies
of
our
class
but
there
was
no
time
for
further
reflection
nor
had
i
recovered
breath
enough
for
another
word
when
the
hansom
clattered
up
the
cobbles
into
waterloo
station
and
our
last
sprint
of
that
athletic
night
ended
in
a
simultaneous
leap
into
separate
carriages
as
the
platform
slid
away
from
the
train
chapter
xiii
knocked
out
but
it
was
hardly
likely
to
be
the
last
excitement
of
the
night
as
i
saw
for
myself
before
raffles
joined
me
at
vauxhall
an
like
daniel
levy
might
at
least
be
trusted
to
play
the
game
out
with
loaded
dice
no
single
sportsman
could
compete
against
his
callous
machinations
and
that
was
obviously
where
i
was
coming
in
i
only
wished
i
had
not
come
in
before
i
saw
now
the
harm
that
i
had
done
by
my
rash
proceedings
in
gray
inn
the
extra
risk
entailed
already
and
a
worse
one
still
impending
if
the
wretches
who
had
shadowed
him
were
really
mercenaries
and
if
they
really
had
been
taken
in
their
own
trap
their
first
measure
of
would
be
the
denunciation
of
raffles
to
the
real
police
such
at
least
was
my
idea
and
raffles
himself
made
light
enough
of
it
he
thought
they
could
not
expose
him
without
dragging
in
levy
who
had
probably
made
it
worth
their
while
not
to
do
that
on
any
consideration
his
magnanimity
in
the
matter
which
he
flatly
refused
to
take
as
seriously
as
i
did
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
press
old
raffles
as
i
otherwise
might
have
done
for
an
outline
of
those
further
plans
in
which
i
hoped
to
atone
for
my
blunders
by
being
of
some
use
to
him
after
all
his
nonchalant
manner
convinced
me
that
they
were
but
i
was
left
perhaps
deservedly
in
the
dark
as
to
the
details
i
merely
gathered
that
he
had
brought
down
some
document
for
levy
to
sign
in
execution
of
the
verbal
agreement
made
between
them
in
town
not
until
that
agreement
was
completed
by
his
signature
was
the
harpy
to
receive
the
precious
epistle
he
pretended
never
to
have
written
raffles
in
fine
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
the
game
in
his
hands
who
is
none
the
less
prepared
for
foul
play
on
the
other
side
and
by
no
means
perturbed
at
the
prospect
we
left
the
train
at
a
platform
on
which
the
lights
were
being
extinguished
as
we
turned
into
a
quiet
road
where
bats
flew
over
our
heads
between
the
and
a
policeman
was
passing
a
disc
of
light
over
a
abuse
of
the
name
of
queen
anne
our
way
led
through
quieter
roads
of
larger
houses
standing
further
back
until
at
last
we
came
to
the
enemy
gates
they
were
wooden
gates
without
a
lodge
yet
the
house
set
well
beyond
them
on
the
river
brim
was
a
mansion
of
considerable
size
and
still
greater
peculiarity
it
was
really
two
houses
large
and
small
connected
by
a
spine
of
white
posts
and
joists
and
glimmering
glass
in
the
more
substantial
building
no
lights
were
to
be
seen
from
the
gates
but
in
the
annex
a
large
french
window
made
a
lighted
square
at
right
angles
with
the
river
and
the
road
we
had
set
foot
in
the
gravel
drive
with
a
long
line
of
poplars
down
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
wide
lawn
dotted
with
cedars
and
small
shrubs
when
raffles
strode
among
these
with
a
smothered
exclamation
and
a
wild
figure
started
from
the
ground
what
are
you
doing
here
demanded
raffles
with
all
the
righteous
austerity
of
a
citizen
nutting
sare
replied
an
alien
tongue
a
gleam
of
good
teeth
in
the
shadow
of
his
great
soft
hat
i
been
see
mistare
in
ze
on
ze
beezness
shentlemen
seen
him
have
you
then
if
i
were
you
i
should
make
a
decent
departure
said
raffles
by
the
gate
to
which
he
pointed
with
increased
severity
of
tone
and
bearing
the
weird
figure
uncovered
a
shaggy
head
of
hair
made
us
a
grotesque
bow
with
his
right
hand
melodramatically
buried
in
the
folds
of
a
voluminous
cape
and
stalked
off
in
the
starlight
with
much
dignity
but
we
heard
him
running
in
the
road
before
the
gate
had
clicked
behind
him
is
that
the
fellow
we
saw
in
jermyn
street
last
thursday
i
asked
raffles
in
a
whisper
that
the
chap
he
whispered
back
i
wonder
if
he
spotted
us
bunny
levy
treated
him
scandalously
of
course
it
all
came
out
in
a
torrent
the
other
morning
i
only
hope
he
has
been
serving
dan
levy
as
jack
rutter
served
old
baird
i
could
swear
that
was
a
weapon
of
sorts
got
under
his
cloak
and
as
we
stood
together
under
the
stars
listening
to
the
last
of
the
runaway
footfalls
i
recalled
the
killing
of
another
and
a
less
notorious
usurer
by
a
man
we
both
knew
and
had
even
helped
to
shield
from
the
consequences
of
his
crime
yet
the
memory
of
our
terrible
discovery
on
that
occasion
had
not
the
effect
of
making
me
shrink
from
such
another
now
nor
could
i
echo
the
hope
of
raffles
in
my
heart
of
hearts
if
dan
levy
also
had
come
to
a
bad
end
well
it
was
no
more
than
he
deserved
if
only
for
his
treachery
to
raffles
and
at
any
rate
it
would
put
a
stop
to
our
plunging
from
bad
to
worse
in
an
adventure
of
which
the
sequel
might
well
be
worst
of
all
i
do
not
say
that
i
was
wicked
enough
absolutely
to
desire
the
death
of
this
sinner
for
our
benefit
but
i
saw
the
benefit
at
least
as
plainly
as
the
awful
possibility
and
it
was
not
with
unalloyed
relief
that
i
beheld
a
great
figure
stride
through
the
lighted
windows
at
our
nearer
approach
though
his
back
was
to
the
light
before
i
saw
his
face
and
the
whole
man
might
have
been
hacked
out
of
ebony
it
was
every
inch
the
living
levy
who
stood
peering
in
our
direction
one
hand
hollowed
at
an
ear
the
other
shading
both
eyes
is
that
you
boys
he
croaked
in
sepulchral
salute
it
depends
which
boys
you
mean
replied
raffles
marching
into
the
zone
of
light
there
are
so
many
of
us
about
levy
arms
dropped
at
his
sides
and
i
heard
him
mutter
raffles
with
a
malediction
next
moment
he
was
inquiring
whether
we
had
come
down
alone
yet
peering
past
us
into
the
velvet
night
for
his
answer
i
brought
our
friend
bunny
said
raffles
but
that
all
then
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
there
are
so
many
of
you
about
i
was
thinking
of
the
gentleman
who
was
here
just
before
us
here
just
before
you
why
i
have
seen
a
soul
since
my
went
to
bed
but
we
met
the
fellow
just
this
minute
within
your
gates
a
little
foreign
devil
with
a
head
like
a
mop
and
the
cloak
of
an
operatic
conspirator
that
beggar
cried
levy
flying
into
a
high
state
of
excitement
on
the
spot
that
blessed
little
beggar
on
my
tracks
down
here
i
him
thrown
out
of
the
office
in
jermyn
street
he
threatened
me
by
letter
and
telegram
so
now
he
thinks
he
come
and
try
it
on
in
person
down
seen
me
eh
i
wish
i
seen
i
ready
for
biters
like
that
gentlemen
i
not
to
be
caught
on
the
down
here
and
a
plated
revolver
twinkled
and
flashed
in
the
electric
light
as
levy
drew
it
from
his
hip
pocket
and
flourished
it
in
our
faces
he
would
have
gone
prowling
through
the
grounds
with
it
if
raffles
had
not
assured
him
that
the
foreign
foe
had
fled
on
our
arrival
as
it
was
the
pistol
was
not
put
back
in
his
pocket
when
levy
at
length
conducted
us
indoors
he
placed
it
on
an
occasional
table
beside
the
glass
that
he
drained
on
entering
and
forthwith
set
his
back
to
a
fire
which
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
advanced
hour
and
doubly
welcome
in
an
apartment
so
vast
that
the
billiard
table
was
a
mere
item
at
one
end
and
sundry
trophies
of
travel
and
the
chase
a
far
more
striking
and
unforeseen
feature
why
that
a
better
grisly
than
the
one
at
lord
exclaimed
raffles
pausing
to
admire
a
glorious
fellow
near
the
door
while
i
mixed
myself
the
drink
he
had
declined
yes
said
levy
the
man
that
shot
all
this
lot
used
to
go
about
saying
he
shoot
at
one
time
but
i
need
tell
you
he
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
and
went
an
did
what
some
folks
call
a
worse
instead
he
did
get
much
show
can
tell
you
that
little
foreign
snipe
wo
either
nor
yet
any
other
carrion
that
think
they
want
my
blood
i
empty
this
shooter
o
mine
into
their
as
soon
as
look
at
i
do
give
a
curse
who
they
are
just
as
well
i
was
brought
up
to
your
profession
eh
raffles
i
do
quite
follow
you
mr
levy
oh
yes
you
do
said
the
with
his
gastric
chuckle
you
got
on
with
that
little
bit
o
burgling
and
i
saw
him
screw
up
his
bright
eyes
and
glance
through
the
open
windows
into
the
outer
darkness
as
though
there
was
still
a
hope
in
his
mind
that
we
had
not
come
down
alone
i
formed
the
impression
that
levy
had
returned
by
a
fairly
late
train
himself
for
he
was
in
morning
dress
in
dusty
boots
and
there
was
an
abundant
supply
of
sandwiches
on
the
table
with
the
drinks
but
he
seemed
to
have
confined
his
own
attentions
to
the
bottle
and
i
liked
to
think
that
the
sandwiches
had
been
cut
for
the
two
emissaries
for
whom
he
was
welcome
to
look
out
for
all
night
how
did
you
get
on
he
repeated
when
he
had
given
them
up
for
the
present
for
a
first
attempt
replied
raffles
without
a
twinkle
i
do
think
i
done
so
badly
ah
i
keep
forgetting
you
a
young
beginner
said
levy
catching
the
old
note
in
his
turn
a
beginner
who
scarcely
likely
to
go
on
levy
if
all
cribs
are
as
easy
to
crack
as
that
lawyers
office
of
yours
in
gray
inn
square
as
easy
raffles
recollected
his
pose
it
was
enormous
fun
said
he
of
course
one
could
know
that
there
would
be
no
hitch
there
was
an
exciting
moment
towards
the
end
i
have
to
thank
you
for
quite
a
new
thrill
of
sorts
but
my
dear
levy
it
was
as
easy
as
ringing
the
bell
and
being
shown
in
it
only
took
rather
longer
what
about
the
caretaker
asked
the
usurer
with
a
curiosity
no
longer
to
be
concealed
he
obliged
me
by
taking
his
wife
to
the
theatre
at
your
expense
no
levy
the
item
will
be
debited
to
you
in
due
course
so
you
got
in
without
any
difficulty
over
the
roof
and
then
i
hit
upon
the
right
room
and
then
raffles
i
opened
the
right
safe
go
on
man
but
the
man
was
only
going
on
at
his
own
rate
and
the
more
levy
pressed
him
the
greater
his
apparent
reluctance
to
go
on
at
all
well
i
found
the
letter
all
right
oh
yes
i
made
a
copy
of
it
was
it
a
good
copy
almost
too
good
if
you
ask
me
thus
raffles
under
increasing
pressure
well
well
you
left
that
one
there
i
suppose
what
happened
next
there
was
no
longer
any
masking
the
moneylender
eagerness
to
extract
the
of
raffles
adventure
that
it
required
extracting
must
have
seemed
a
sufficient
earnest
of
the
ultimate
misadventure
so
craftily
plotted
by
levy
himself
his
great
nose
glowed
with
the
imminence
of
victory
his
strong
lips
loosened
their
habitual
hold
upon
each
other
and
there
was
an
impressionist
daub
of
yellow
fang
between
the
brilliant
little
eyes
were
reduced
to
sparkling
pinheads
of
malevolent
glee
this
was
not
the
fighting
face
i
knew
better
and
despised
less
it
was
the
living
epitome
of
low
cunning
and
foul
play
the
next
thing
that
happened
said
raffles
in
his
most
leisurely
manner
was
the
descent
of
bunny
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
had
he
gone
in
with
you
no
he
came
in
after
me
as
bold
as
blazes
to
say
that
a
couple
of
common
low
detectives
were
waiting
for
me
down
below
in
the
square
that
was
very
kind
of
snarled
levy
pouring
a
murderous
fire
upon
my
person
from
his
little
black
eyes
kind
cried
raffles
it
saved
the
whole
show
it
did
did
it
i
had
time
to
dodge
the
limbs
of
the
law
by
getting
out
another
way
and
never
letting
them
know
that
i
had
got
out
at
all
then
you
left
them
there
in
their
glory
said
raffles
radiant
in
his
own
though
i
must
confess
i
could
not
see
them
at
the
time
there
were
excellent
reasons
for
not
stating
there
and
then
the
delicious
plight
in
which
we
had
really
left
levy
myrmidons
i
myself
would
have
driven
home
our
triumph
and
his
treachery
by
throwing
our
winning
cards
upon
the
table
and
simultaneously
exposing
his
false
play
but
raffles
was
right
and
i
should
have
been
wrong
as
i
was
soon
enough
to
see
for
myself
and
you
came
away
i
suppose
suggested
the
ironically
with
my
original
letter
in
your
pocket
oh
no
i
did
replied
raffles
with
a
reproving
shake
of
the
head
i
thought
not
cried
levy
in
a
gust
of
exultation
i
came
away
said
raffles
if
you
pardon
the
correction
with
the
letter
you
never
dreamt
of
writing
mr
levy
the
jew
turned
a
deeper
shade
of
yellow
but
he
had
the
wisdom
and
the
otherwise
to
ignore
the
point
against
him
you
better
let
me
see
it
said
he
and
flung
out
his
open
hand
with
a
gesture
of
authority
which
it
took
a
raffles
to
resist
levy
was
still
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
i
was
at
his
feet
in
a
chair
with
my
yellow
beaker
on
the
table
at
my
elbow
but
raffles
remained
aloof
upon
his
legs
and
he
withdrew
still
further
from
the
fire
as
he
unfolded
a
large
sheet
of
office
paper
stamped
with
the
notorious
address
in
jermyn
street
and
displayed
it
on
high
like
a
phylactery
you
may
see
by
all
means
levy
said
raffles
with
a
slight
but
sufficient
emphasis
on
his
verb
but
i
not
to
touch
is
that
it
i
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
look
first
said
raffles
smiling
i
should
suggest
however
that
you
exercise
the
same
caution
in
showing
me
that
part
of
your
pro
which
you
have
doubtless
in
readiness
the
other
part
is
in
my
pocket
ready
for
you
to
sign
and
after
that
the
three
little
papers
can
change
hands
simultaneously
nothing
could
have
excelled
the
firmness
of
this
intimation
except
the
exggravating
delicacy
with
which
it
was
conveyed
i
saw
levy
clench
and
unclench
his
great
fists
and
his
canine
jaw
working
protuberantly
as
he
ground
his
teeth
but
not
a
word
escaped
him
and
i
was
admiring
the
monster
when
of
a
sudden
he
swooped
upon
the
table
at
my
side
completely
filled
his
empty
glass
with
neat
whiskey
and
spluttering
and
blinking
from
an
enormous
gulp
made
a
lurch
for
raffles
with
his
drink
in
one
hand
and
his
plated
pistol
in
the
other
now
i
have
a
look
he
hiccoughed
an
a
good
look
unless
you
want
a
lump
of
lead
in
your
liver
raffles
awaited
his
uncertain
advance
with
a
contemptuous
smile
you
not
such
a
fool
as
all
that
levy
drunk
or
sober
said
he
but
his
eye
was
on
the
waving
weapon
and
so
was
mine
and
i
was
wondering
how
a
man
could
have
got
so
very
suddenly
drunk
when
the
nobbler
of
crude
spirit
was
hurled
with
most
sober
aim
glass
and
all
full
in
the
face
of
raffles
and
the
letter
plucked
from
his
grasp
and
flung
upon
the
fire
while
raffles
was
still
reeling
in
his
blindness
and
before
i
had
struggled
to
my
feet
raffles
for
the
moment
was
absolutely
blinded
as
i
say
his
face
was
streaming
with
blood
and
whiskey
and
the
prince
of
traitors
already
crowing
over
his
vile
handiwork
but
that
was
only
for
a
moment
too
the
blackguard
had
been
fool
enough
to
turn
his
back
on
me
and
first
jumping
upon
my
chair
i
sprang
upon
him
like
any
leopard
and
brought
him
down
with
my
ten
fingers
in
his
neck
and
such
a
crack
on
the
parquet
with
his
skull
as
left
it
a
deadweight
on
my
hands
i
remember
the
rasping
of
his
bristles
as
i
disengaged
my
fingers
and
let
the
leaden
head
fall
back
it
fell
sideways
now
and
if
it
had
but
looked
less
dead
i
believe
i
should
have
stamped
the
life
out
of
the
reptile
on
the
spot
i
know
that
i
rose
exultant
from
my
deed
chapter
xiv
corpus
delicti
raffles
was
still
stamping
and
staggering
with
his
knuckles
in
his
eyes
and
i
heard
him
saying
the
letter
bunny
the
letter
in
a
way
that
made
me
realise
all
at
once
that
he
had
been
saying
nothing
else
since
the
moment
of
the
foul
assault
it
was
too
late
now
and
must
have
been
from
the
first
a
few
filmy
scraps
of
blackened
paper
stirring
on
the
hearth
were
all
that
remained
of
the
letter
by
which
levy
had
set
such
store
for
which
raffles
had
risked
so
much
he
burnt
it
said
i
he
was
too
quick
for
me
and
he
nearly
burnt
my
eyes
out
returned
raffles
rubbing
them
again
he
was
too
quick
for
us
both
not
altogether
said
i
grimly
i
believe
i
cracked
his
skull
and
finished
him
off
raffles
rubbed
and
rubbed
until
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
blinking
out
of
a
face
into
that
of
the
fallen
man
he
found
and
felt
the
pulse
in
a
wrist
like
a
ship
cable
no
bunny
there
some
life
in
him
yet
run
out
and
see
if
there
are
any
lights
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
when
i
came
back
raffles
was
listening
at
the
door
leading
into
the
long
glass
passage
not
a
light
said
i
nor
a
sound
he
whispered
we
in
better
luck
than
we
might
have
been
even
his
revolver
did
go
off
raffles
extracted
it
from
under
the
prostrate
body
it
might
just
as
easily
have
gone
off
and
shot
him
or
one
of
us
and
he
put
the
pistol
in
his
own
pocket
but
have
i
killed
him
raffles
not
yet
bunny
but
do
you
think
he
going
to
die
i
was
overcome
by
reaction
now
my
knees
knocked
together
my
teeth
chattered
in
my
head
nor
could
i
look
any
longer
upon
the
great
body
sprawling
prone
or
the
insensate
head
twisted
sideways
on
the
parquet
floor
he
all
right
said
raffles
when
he
had
knelt
and
felt
and
listened
again
i
whimpered
a
pious
but
inconsistent
ejaculation
raffles
sat
back
on
his
heels
and
meditatively
wiped
a
smear
of
his
own
blood
from
the
polished
floor
you
better
leave
him
to
me
he
said
looking
and
getting
up
with
sudden
decision
but
what
am
i
to
do
go
down
to
the
boathouse
and
wait
in
the
boat
where
is
the
boathouse
you
ca
miss
it
if
you
follow
the
lawn
down
to
the
water
edge
there
a
door
on
this
side
if
it
is
open
force
it
with
this
and
he
passed
me
his
pocket
jimmy
as
naturally
as
another
would
have
handed
over
a
bunch
of
keys
and
what
then
you
find
yourself
on
the
top
step
leading
down
to
the
water
stand
tight
and
lash
out
all
round
until
you
find
a
windlass
wind
that
windlass
as
gingerly
as
though
it
were
a
watch
with
a
weak
heart
you
will
be
raising
a
kind
of
portcullis
at
the
other
end
of
the
boathouse
but
if
you
heard
doing
it
at
dead
of
night
we
may
have
to
run
or
swim
for
it
raise
the
thing
just
high
enough
to
let
us
under
in
the
boat
and
then
lie
low
on
board
till
i
come
reluctant
to
leave
that
ghastly
form
upon
the
floor
but
now
stricken
helpless
in
its
presence
i
was
softer
wax
than
ever
in
the
hands
of
raffles
and
soon
found
myself
alone
in
the
dew
upon
an
errand
in
which
i
neither
saw
nor
sought
for
any
point
enough
that
raffles
had
given
me
something
to
do
for
our
salvation
what
part
he
had
assigned
to
himself
what
he
was
about
indoors
already
and
the
nature
of
his
ultimate
design
were
questions
quite
beyond
me
for
the
moment
i
did
not
worry
about
them
had
i
killed
my
man
that
was
the
one
thing
that
mattered
to
me
and
i
frankly
doubt
whether
even
it
mattered
at
the
time
so
supremely
as
it
seemed
to
have
mattered
now
away
from
the
my
horror
was
already
less
of
the
deed
than
of
the
consequences
and
i
had
quite
a
level
view
of
those
what
i
had
done
was
barely
even
manslaughter
at
the
worst
but
at
the
best
the
man
was
not
dead
raffles
was
bringing
him
to
life
again
alive
or
dead
i
could
trust
him
to
raffles
and
go
about
my
own
part
of
the
business
as
indeed
i
did
in
a
kind
of
torpor
of
the
normal
sensibilities
not
much
do
i
remember
of
that
dreamy
interval
until
the
dream
became
the
nightmare
that
was
still
in
store
the
river
ran
like
a
broad
road
under
the
stars
with
hardly
a
glimmer
and
not
a
floating
thing
upon
it
the
boathouse
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
file
of
poplars
and
i
only
found
it
by
stooping
low
and
getting
everything
over
my
own
height
against
the
stars
the
door
was
not
locked
but
the
darkness
within
was
such
that
i
could
not
see
my
own
hand
as
it
wound
the
windlass
inch
by
inch
between
the
slow
ticking
of
the
cogs
i
listened
jealously
for
foreign
sounds
and
heard
at
length
a
gentle
dripping
across
the
breadth
of
the
boathouse
that
was
the
last
of
the
portcullis
as
raffles
called
it
rising
out
of
the
river
indeed
i
could
now
see
the
difference
in
the
stretch
of
stream
underneath
for
the
open
end
of
the
boathouse
was
much
less
dark
than
mine
and
when
the
faint
band
of
reflected
starlight
had
broadened
as
i
thought
enough
i
ceased
winding
and
groped
my
way
down
the
steps
into
the
boat
but
inaction
at
such
a
crisis
was
an
intolerable
state
and
the
last
thing
i
wanted
was
time
to
think
with
nothing
more
to
do
i
must
needs
wonder
what
i
was
doing
in
the
boat
and
then
what
raffles
could
want
with
the
boat
if
it
was
true
that
levy
was
not
seriously
hurt
i
could
see
the
strategic
value
of
my
position
if
we
had
been
robbing
the
house
but
raffles
was
not
out
for
robbery
this
time
and
i
did
not
believe
he
would
suddenly
change
his
mind
could
it
be
that
he
had
never
been
quite
confident
of
the
recovery
of
levy
but
had
sent
me
to
prepare
this
means
of
escape
from
the
scene
of
a
tragedy
i
can
not
have
been
long
in
the
boat
for
my
thwart
was
still
rocking
under
me
when
this
suspicion
shot
me
ashore
in
a
cold
sweat
in
my
haste
i
went
into
the
river
up
to
one
knee
and
ran
across
the
lawn
with
that
boot
squelching
raffles
came
out
of
the
lighted
room
to
meet
me
and
as
he
stood
like
levy
against
the
electric
glare
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
he
was
wearing
an
overcoat
that
did
not
belong
to
him
and
that
the
pockets
of
this
overcoat
were
bulging
grotesquely
but
it
was
the
last
thing
i
remembered
in
the
horror
that
was
to
come
levy
was
lying
where
i
had
left
him
only
straighter
and
with
a
cushion
under
his
head
as
though
he
were
not
merely
dead
but
laid
out
in
his
clothes
where
he
had
fallen
i
was
just
coming
for
you
bunny
whispered
raffles
before
i
could
find
my
voice
i
want
you
to
take
hold
of
his
boots
his
boots
i
gasped
taking
raffles
by
the
sleeve
instead
what
on
earth
for
to
carry
him
down
to
the
boat
but
is
he
is
he
still
alive
raffles
was
smiling
as
though
i
amused
him
mightily
rather
bunny
too
full
of
life
to
be
left
i
can
tell
you
but
it
be
daylight
if
we
stop
for
explanations
now
are
you
going
to
lend
a
hand
or
am
i
to
drag
him
through
the
dew
myself
i
lent
every
fibre
and
raffles
raised
the
lifeless
trunk
i
suppose
by
the
armpits
and
led
the
way
backward
into
the
night
after
switching
off
the
lights
within
but
the
first
stage
of
our
revolting
journey
was
a
very
short
one
we
deposited
our
poor
burden
as
charily
as
possible
on
the
gravel
and
i
watched
over
it
for
some
of
the
longest
minutes
of
my
life
while
raffles
shut
and
fastened
all
the
windows
left
the
room
as
levy
himself
might
have
left
it
and
finally
found
his
way
out
by
one
of
the
doors
and
all
the
while
not
a
movement
or
a
sound
came
from
the
senseless
clay
at
my
feet
but
once
when
i
bent
over
him
the
smell
of
whiskey
was
curiously
vital
and
reassuring
we
started
off
again
raffles
with
every
muscle
on
the
strain
i
with
every
nerve
this
time
we
staggered
across
the
lawn
without
a
rest
but
at
the
boathouse
we
put
him
down
in
the
dew
until
i
took
off
my
coat
and
we
got
him
lying
on
that
while
we
debated
about
the
boathouse
its
darkness
and
its
steps
the
combination
beat
us
on
a
moment
consideration
and
again
i
was
the
one
to
stay
and
watch
and
listen
to
my
own
heart
beating
and
then
to
the
water
bubbling
at
the
prow
and
dripping
from
the
blades
as
raffles
sculled
round
to
the
edge
of
the
lawn
i
need
dwell
no
more
upon
the
difficulty
and
the
horror
of
getting
that
inanimate
mass
on
board
both
were
bad
enough
but
candour
compels
me
to
admit
that
the
difficulty
dwarfed
all
else
until
at
last
we
overcame
it
how
near
we
were
to
swamping
our
craft
and
making
sure
of
our
victim
by
drowning
i
still
shudder
to
remember
but
i
think
it
must
have
prevented
me
from
shuddering
over
more
remote
possibilities
at
the
time
it
was
a
time
if
ever
there
was
one
to
trust
in
raffles
and
keep
one
powder
dry
and
to
that
extent
i
may
say
i
played
the
game
but
it
was
his
game
not
mine
and
its
very
object
was
unknown
to
me
never
in
fact
had
i
followed
my
inveterate
leader
quite
so
implicitly
so
blindly
or
with
such
reckless
excitement
and
yet
if
the
worst
did
happen
and
our
mute
passenger
was
never
to
open
his
eyes
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
well
on
the
road
to
turn
manslaughter
into
murder
in
the
eyes
of
any
british
jury
the
road
that
might
easily
lead
to
destruction
at
the
hangman
hands
but
a
more
immediate
menace
seemed
only
to
have
awaited
the
actual
moment
of
embarkation
when
as
we
were
pushing
off
the
rhythmical
plash
and
swish
of
a
paddle
fell
suddenly
upon
our
ears
and
we
clutched
the
bank
while
a
canoe
shot
within
a
length
of
us
luckily
the
night
was
as
dark
as
ever
and
all
we
saw
of
the
paddler
was
a
white
shirt
fluttering
as
it
passed
but
there
lay
levy
with
his
heavy
head
between
my
shins
in
the
with
his
waistcoat
open
and
white
shirt
catching
what
light
there
was
as
greedily
as
the
other
and
his
white
face
as
conspicuous
to
my
guilty
mind
as
though
we
had
rubbed
it
with
phosphorus
nor
was
i
the
only
one
to
lay
this
last
peril
to
heart
raffles
sat
silent
for
several
minutes
on
his
thwart
and
when
he
did
dip
his
sculls
it
was
to
muffle
his
strokes
so
that
even
i
could
scarcely
hear
them
and
to
keep
peering
behind
him
down
the
stygian
stream
so
long
had
we
been
getting
under
way
that
nothing
surprised
me
more
than
the
extreme
brevity
of
our
actual
voyage
not
many
houses
and
gardens
had
slipped
behind
us
on
the
middlesex
shore
when
we
turned
into
an
inlet
running
under
the
very
windows
of
a
house
so
near
the
river
itself
that
even
i
might
have
thrown
a
stone
from
any
one
of
them
into
surrey
the
inlet
was
empty
and
there
was
a
crazy
and
the
many
windows
overlooking
us
had
the
black
gloss
of
empty
darkness
within
seen
by
starlight
with
a
troubled
eye
the
house
had
one
salient
feature
in
the
shape
of
a
square
tower
which
stood
out
from
the
facade
fronting
the
river
and
rose
to
nearly
twice
the
height
of
the
main
roof
but
this
curious
excrescence
only
added
to
the
forbidding
character
of
as
gloomy
a
mansion
as
one
could
wish
to
approach
by
stealth
at
dead
of
night
what
this
place
i
whispered
as
raffles
made
fast
to
a
post
an
unoccupied
house
bunny
do
you
mean
to
occupy
it
i
mean
our
passenger
to
do
so
if
we
can
land
him
alive
or
dead
hush
raffles
it
a
case
of
heels
first
this
time
shut
up
raffles
was
kneeling
on
the
luckily
on
a
level
with
our
rowlocks
and
reaching
down
into
the
boat
give
me
his
heels
he
muttered
you
can
look
after
his
business
end
you
need
be
afraid
of
waking
the
old
hound
nor
yet
hurting
him
i
not
i
whispered
though
mere
words
had
never
made
my
blood
run
colder
you
do
understand
me
listen
to
that
and
as
raffles
knelt
on
the
and
i
crouched
in
the
boat
with
something
desperately
like
a
dead
man
stretched
between
us
there
was
a
swish
and
a
dip
outside
the
inlet
and
a
flutter
of
white
on
the
river
beyond
another
narrow
squeak
he
muttered
with
grim
levity
when
the
sound
had
died
away
i
wonder
who
it
is
paddling
his
own
canoe
at
dead
of
night
i
wondering
how
much
he
saw
nothing
said
raffles
as
though
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
on
the
point
what
did
we
see
to
swear
to
between
a
sweater
and
a
only
something
white
and
we
were
looking
out
and
it
far
darker
in
here
than
out
there
on
the
main
stream
but
soon
be
getting
light
and
we
really
may
be
seen
unless
we
land
our
big
fish
first
and
without
more
ado
he
dragged
the
lifeless
levy
ashore
by
the
heels
while
i
alternately
grasped
the
to
steady
the
boat
and
did
my
best
to
protect
the
limp
members
and
the
leaden
head
from
actual
injury
all
my
efforts
could
not
avert
a
few
hard
knocks
however
and
these
were
sustained
with
such
a
horrifying
insensibility
of
body
and
limb
that
my
worst
suspicions
were
renewed
before
i
crawled
ashore
myself
and
remained
kneeling
over
the
prostrate
form
are
you
certain
raffles
i
began
and
could
not
finish
the
awful
question
that
he
alive
said
raffles
rather
bunny
and
he
be
kicking
below
the
belt
again
in
a
few
more
hours
a
few
more
i
give
him
four
or
five
then
it
concussion
of
the
brain
it
the
brain
all
right
said
raffles
but
for
i
should
say
if
i
were
you
what
have
i
done
i
murmured
shaking
my
head
over
the
poor
old
brute
you
said
raffles
less
than
you
think
perhaps
but
the
man
never
moved
a
muscle
oh
yes
he
has
bunny
when
i
tell
you
at
the
next
stage
said
raffles
up
with
his
heels
and
come
this
way
and
we
trailed
across
a
lawn
so
woefully
neglected
that
the
big
body
sagging
between
us
though
it
cleared
the
ground
by
several
inches
swept
the
dew
from
the
rank
growth
until
we
got
it
propped
up
on
some
steps
at
the
base
of
the
tower
and
raffles
ran
up
to
open
the
door
more
steps
there
were
within
stone
steps
allowing
so
little
room
for
one
foot
and
so
much
for
the
other
as
to
suggest
a
spiral
staircase
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
tower
so
it
turned
out
to
be
but
there
were
landings
communicating
with
the
house
and
on
the
first
of
them
we
laid
our
man
and
sat
down
to
rest
how
i
love
a
silent
uncomplaining
stone
staircase
sighed
the
now
quite
invisible
raffles
so
of
course
we
find
one
thrown
away
upon
an
empty
house
are
you
there
bunny
rather
are
you
quite
sure
nobody
else
is
here
i
asked
for
he
was
scarcely
troubling
to
lower
his
voice
only
levy
and
he
wo
count
till
all
hours
i
waiting
to
hear
how
you
know
have
a
sullivan
first
are
we
as
safe
as
all
that
if
we
careful
to
make
an
of
our
own
pockets
said
raffles
and
i
heard
him
tapping
his
cigarette
in
the
dark
i
refused
to
run
any
risks
next
moment
his
match
revealed
him
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
one
flight
and
me
at
the
top
of
the
flight
below
either
spiral
was
lost
in
shadow
and
all
i
saw
besides
was
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
the
lips
of
raffles
more
clouds
of
cobwebs
and
levy
boots
lying
over
on
their
uppers
almost
in
my
lap
raffles
called
my
attention
to
them
before
he
blew
out
his
match
he
has
turned
his
toes
up
yet
you
see
it
a
hog
sleep
but
not
by
any
means
his
last
did
you
mean
just
now
that
he
woke
up
while
i
was
in
the
boathouse
almost
as
soon
as
your
back
was
turned
bunny
if
you
call
it
waking
up
you
had
knocked
him
out
you
know
but
only
for
a
few
minutes
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
he
was
none
the
worse
very
little
bunny
my
feeble
heart
jumped
about
in
my
body
then
what
knocked
him
out
again
i
did
in
the
same
way
no
bunny
he
asked
for
a
drink
and
i
gave
him
one
a
doctored
drink
i
whispered
with
some
horror
it
was
refreshing
to
feel
once
more
horrified
at
some
act
not
one
own
so
to
speak
said
raffles
with
a
gesture
that
i
followed
by
the
red
end
of
his
cigarette
i
certainly
touched
it
up
a
bit
but
i
always
meant
to
touch
up
his
liquor
if
the
beggar
went
back
on
his
word
he
did
a
good
deal
worse
for
the
second
time
of
asking
and
you
did
better
than
i
ever
knew
you
do
before
bunny
i
simply
carried
on
the
good
work
our
friend
is
full
of
a
judicious
blend
of
his
own
whiskey
and
the
stuff
poor
teddy
had
the
other
night
and
when
he
does
come
to
his
senses
i
believe
we
shall
find
him
damned
sensible
and
if
he
is
i
suppose
you
keep
him
here
until
he
is
i
shall
hold
him
up
to
ransom
said
raffles
at
the
top
of
this
ruddy
tower
until
he
pays
through
both
nostrils
for
the
privilege
of
climbing
down
alive
you
mean
until
he
stands
by
his
side
of
your
bargain
said
i
only
hoping
that
was
his
meaning
but
not
without
other
apprehensions
which
raffles
speedily
confirmed
and
the
rest
he
replied
significantly
you
do
suppose
the
going
to
get
off
as
lightly
as
if
he
played
the
game
do
you
i
got
one
of
my
own
to
play
now
bunny
and
i
mean
to
play
it
for
all
worth
i
thought
it
would
come
to
this
in
fact
he
had
foreseen
treachery
from
the
first
and
the
desperate
device
of
kidnapping
the
traitor
proved
to
have
been
as
deliberate
a
move
as
raffles
had
ever
planned
to
meet
a
probable
contingency
he
had
brought
down
a
pair
of
handcuffs
as
well
as
a
sufficient
supply
of
somnol
my
own
deed
of
violence
was
the
one
entirely
unforeseen
effect
and
raffles
vowed
it
had
been
a
help
but
when
i
inquired
whether
he
had
ever
been
over
this
empty
house
before
an
irritable
jerk
of
his
cigarette
end
foretold
the
answer
my
good
bunny
is
this
a
time
for
rotten
questions
of
course
i
been
over
the
whole
place
did
i
tell
you
i
been
spending
the
in
these
parts
i
got
an
order
to
view
the
place
and
have
bribed
the
gardener
not
to
let
anybody
else
see
over
it
till
i
made
up
my
mind
the
gardener
cottage
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
road
which
runs
flush
with
the
front
of
the
house
there
a
splendid
garden
on
that
side
but
it
takes
him
all
his
time
to
keep
it
up
so
he
given
up
bothering
about
this
bit
here
he
only
sets
foot
in
the
house
to
show
people
over
his
wife
comes
in
sometimes
to
open
the
downstairs
windows
the
ones
upstairs
are
never
shut
so
you
perceive
we
shall
be
fairly
free
from
interruption
at
the
top
of
this
tower
especially
when
i
tell
you
that
it
finishes
in
a
room
as
as
old
carlyle
in
cheyne
row
it
flashed
across
me
that
another
great
man
of
letters
had
made
his
local
habitation
if
not
his
name
in
this
part
of
the
thames
valley
and
when
i
asked
if
this
was
that
celebrity
house
raffles
seemed
surprised
that
i
had
not
recognised
it
as
such
in
the
dark
he
said
it
would
never
let
again
as
the
place
was
far
too
good
for
its
position
which
was
now
much
too
near
london
he
also
told
me
that
the
idea
of
holding
dan
levy
up
to
ransom
had
occurred
to
him
when
he
found
himself
being
followed
about
town
by
levy
mamelukes
and
saw
what
a
traitor
he
had
to
cope
with
and
i
hope
you
like
the
idea
bunny
he
added
because
i
was
never
caught
kidnapping
before
and
in
all
london
there
was
a
bigger
man
to
kidnap
i
love
it
said
i
and
it
was
true
enough
of
the
abstract
idea
but
do
you
think
he
just
a
bit
too
big
wo
the
country
ring
with
his
disappearance
my
dear
bunny
nobody
will
dream
he
disappeared
said
raffles
confidently
i
know
the
habits
of
the
beast
did
i
tell
you
he
ran
another
show
somewhere
nobody
seems
to
know
where
but
when
he
here
that
where
he
supposed
to
be
and
when
he
there
he
cuts
town
for
days
on
end
i
suppose
you
never
noticed
i
been
wearing
an
overcoat
all
this
time
bunny
oh
yes
i
did
said
i
of
course
it
one
of
his
the
very
one
he
have
worn
and
his
soft
hat
from
the
same
peg
is
in
one
of
the
pockets
their
absence
wo
look
as
if
he
come
out
feet
first
will
it
bunny
i
thought
his
stick
might
be
in
the
way
so
instead
of
bringing
it
too
i
stowed
it
away
behind
his
books
but
these
things
will
serve
a
second
turn
when
we
see
our
way
to
letting
him
go
again
like
a
gentleman
the
red
end
of
the
sullivan
went
out
sizzling
between
a
moistened
thumb
and
finger
and
no
doubt
raffles
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
as
he
rose
to
resume
the
ascent
it
was
still
perfectly
dark
on
the
tower
stairs
but
by
the
time
we
reached
the
sanctum
at
the
top
we
could
see
each
other
outlines
against
certain
ovals
of
wild
grey
sky
and
dying
stars
for
there
was
a
window
more
like
a
porthole
in
three
of
the
four
walls
in
the
fourth
wall
was
a
cavity
like
a
ship
bunk
into
which
we
lifted
our
still
unconscious
prisoner
as
gently
as
we
might
nor
was
that
the
last
that
was
done
for
him
now
that
some
slight
amends
were
possible
from
an
invisible
locker
raffles
produced
bundles
of
thin
coarse
stuff
one
of
which
he
placed
as
a
pillow
under
the
head
while
the
other
was
shaken
out
into
a
covering
for
his
body
and
you
asked
me
if
i
ever
been
over
the
place
said
raffles
putting
a
third
bundle
in
my
hands
why
i
slept
up
here
last
night
just
to
see
if
it
was
all
as
quiet
as
it
looked
these
were
my
and
i
want
you
to
follow
my
example
i
go
to
sleep
i
cried
i
could
and
would
for
a
thousand
pounds
raffles
oh
yes
you
could
said
raffles
and
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
horrible
explosion
in
the
tower
upon
my
word
i
thought
one
of
us
was
shot
until
there
came
the
smaller
sounds
of
froth
pattering
on
the
floor
and
liquor
bubbling
from
a
bottle
champagne
i
exclaimed
when
he
had
handed
me
the
metal
cap
of
a
flask
and
i
had
taken
a
sip
did
you
hide
that
up
here
as
well
i
hid
nothing
up
here
except
myself
returned
raffles
laughing
this
is
one
of
a
couple
of
pints
from
the
cellarette
in
levy
billiard
den
take
your
will
of
it
bunny
and
perhaps
the
old
man
may
have
the
other
when
he
a
good
boy
i
fancy
we
shall
find
it
a
stronger
card
than
it
looks
meanwhile
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
and
lying
dogs
sleep
and
you
be
far
more
use
to
me
later
bunny
if
only
you
try
to
do
the
same
i
was
beginning
to
feel
that
i
might
try
for
raffles
was
filling
up
the
metal
cup
every
minute
and
also
plying
me
with
sandwiches
from
table
brought
hence
with
the
champagne
in
levy
overcoat
pocket
it
was
still
pleasing
to
reflect
that
they
had
been
originally
intended
for
the
rival
bravos
of
gray
inn
but
another
idea
that
did
occur
to
me
i
dismissed
at
the
time
and
so
justly
that
i
would
disabuse
any
other
suspicious
mind
of
it
without
delay
dear
old
raffles
was
scarcely
more
skilful
and
audacious
as
amateur
cracksman
than
as
amateur
anaesthetist
nor
was
he
ever
averse
from
the
practice
of
his
uncanny
genius
at
either
game
but
sleepy
as
i
soon
found
myself
at
the
close
of
our
very
long
night
work
i
had
no
subsequent
reason
to
suppose
that
raffles
had
given
drop
or
morsel
of
anything
but
sandwiches
and
champagne
so
i
rolled
myself
up
on
the
locker
just
as
things
were
beginning
to
take
visible
shape
even
without
the
tower
windows
behind
them
and
i
was
almost
dropping
off
to
sleep
when
a
sudden
anxiety
smote
my
mind
what
about
the
boat
i
asked
there
was
no
answer
raffles
i
cried
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
beggar
boat
you
go
to
sleep
came
the
sharp
reply
and
leave
the
boat
to
me
and
i
fancied
from
his
voice
that
raffles
also
had
lain
him
down
but
on
the
floor
chapter
xv
trial
by
raffles
when
i
awoke
it
was
dazzling
daylight
in
the
tower
and
the
little
scene
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
it
had
felt
far
larger
in
the
dark
i
suppose
the
was
about
twelve
feet
square
but
it
was
contracted
on
one
side
by
the
well
and
banisters
of
a
wooden
staircase
from
the
room
below
on
another
by
the
ship
bunk
and
opposite
that
by
the
locker
on
which
i
lay
moreover
the
four
walls
or
rather
the
four
triangles
of
roof
sloped
so
sharply
to
the
apex
of
the
tower
as
to
leave
an
inner
margin
in
which
few
grown
persons
could
have
stood
upright
the
windows
were
shrouded
with
rags
of
cobweb
spotted
with
dead
flies
they
had
evidently
not
been
opened
for
years
it
was
even
more
depressingly
obvious
that
we
must
not
open
them
one
was
thankful
for
such
modicum
of
comparatively
pure
air
as
came
up
the
open
stair
from
the
floor
below
but
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
one
trembled
to
anticipate
the
atmosphere
of
this
stale
and
stuffy
eyrie
through
the
heat
of
a
day
and
yet
neither
the
size
nor
the
scent
of
the
place
nor
any
other
merely
scenic
feature
was
half
so
disturbing
or
fantastic
as
the
appearance
of
my
two
companions
raffles
not
quite
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
but
near
enough
to
loll
over
the
banisters
and
levy
cumbering
the
ship
bunk
were
indeed
startling
figures
to
an
eye
still
dim
with
sleep
raffles
had
an
ugly
cut
from
the
left
nostril
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
he
had
washed
the
blood
from
his
face
but
the
dark
and
angry
streak
remained
to
heighten
his
unusual
pallor
levy
looked
crumpled
and
debauched
flabbily
and
feebly
senile
yet
with
his
vital
forces
making
a
last
flicker
in
his
fiery
eyes
he
was
grotesquely
swathed
in
scarlet
bunting
from
which
his
doubled
fists
protruded
in
handcuffs
a
bit
of
thin
rope
attached
the
handcuffs
to
a
peg
on
which
his
coat
and
hat
were
also
hanging
and
a
longer
bit
was
taken
round
the
banisters
from
the
other
end
of
the
bunting
which
i
now
perceived
to
be
a
tattered
and
torn
red
ensign
this
led
to
the
discovery
that
i
myself
had
been
sleeping
in
the
union
jack
and
it
brought
my
eyes
back
to
the
ghastly
face
of
raffles
who
was
already
smiling
at
mine
enjoyed
your
night
under
canvas
bunny
then
you
might
get
up
and
present
your
colours
to
the
prisoner
in
the
bunk
you
need
be
frightened
of
him
bunny
he
such
a
devilish
tough
customer
that
had
to
clap
him
in
irons
as
you
see
yet
he
ca
say
i
have
given
him
rope
enough
he
got
lashings
of
rope
eh
bunny
that
right
said
levy
with
a
bitter
snarl
get
a
man
down
by
foul
play
and
then
wipe
your
boots
on
him
i
stick
it
like
a
lamb
if
only
you
give
me
that
drink
and
then
it
was
as
i
got
to
my
feet
and
shook
myself
free
from
the
folds
of
the
union
jack
that
i
saw
the
unopened
pint
of
champagne
standing
against
the
banisters
in
full
view
of
the
bunk
i
confess
i
eyed
it
wistfully
myself
but
raffles
was
adamant
alike
to
friend
and
foe
and
merely
beckoned
me
to
follow
him
down
the
wooden
stair
without
answering
levy
at
all
i
certainly
thought
it
a
risk
to
leave
that
worthy
unwatched
for
a
moment
but
it
was
scarcely
for
more
the
room
below
was
fitted
with
a
bath
and
a
lavatory
basin
which
raffles
pointed
out
to
me
without
going
all
the
way
down
himself
at
the
same
time
he
handed
me
a
stale
remnant
of
the
sandwiches
removed
with
levy
from
his
house
i
afraid
you
have
to
wash
these
down
at
that
tap
said
he
the
poor
devil
has
finished
what
you
left
at
daybreak
besides
making
a
hole
in
my
flask
but
he
ca
or
wo
eat
a
bite
and
if
only
he
stands
his
trial
and
takes
his
sentence
like
a
man
i
think
he
might
have
the
other
pint
to
his
own
infernal
cheek
trial
and
sentence
i
exclaimed
i
thought
you
were
going
to
hold
him
up
to
ransom
not
without
a
fair
trial
my
dear
bunny
said
raffles
in
the
accents
of
reproof
we
must
hear
what
the
old
swab
has
to
say
for
himself
when
he
heard
what
i
got
to
say
to
him
so
you
stick
your
head
under
the
tap
when
you
had
your
snack
bunny
it
wo
come
up
to
the
swim
i
had
after
i
taken
the
boat
back
when
you
and
shylock
were
fast
asleep
but
it
all
you
time
for
if
you
want
to
hear
me
open
my
case
and
open
it
he
did
before
himself
as
judge
and
counsel
in
one
sitting
on
the
locker
as
on
the
bench
the
very
moment
i
reappeared
in
court
prisoner
in
the
bunk
before
we
formulate
the
charge
against
you
we
had
better
deal
with
your
last
request
for
drink
made
in
the
same
breath
as
a
preposterous
complaint
about
foul
play
the
request
has
been
made
and
granted
more
than
once
already
this
morning
this
time
it
refused
drink
has
been
your
undoing
prisoner
in
the
bunk
it
is
drink
that
necessitates
your
annual
purification
at
carlsbad
and
yet
within
a
week
of
that
chastening
experience
you
come
before
me
without
knowing
where
you
are
or
how
you
got
here
that
was
the
whisky
muttered
levy
with
a
tortured
brow
that
was
something
else
which
you
hear
more
about
foul
play
it
was
and
you
pay
for
it
yet
there
not
a
headache
in
a
hogshead
of
my
whisky
well
resumed
raffles
your
champagne
is
on
the
same
high
level
and
here
a
pint
of
the
best
which
you
can
open
for
yourself
if
only
you
show
your
sense
before
i
done
with
you
but
you
wo
advance
that
little
millennium
by
talking
about
foul
play
as
though
it
were
all
on
one
side
and
the
foulest
of
the
foul
not
on
yours
you
will
only
retard
the
business
of
the
court
you
are
indicted
with
extortion
and
sharp
practice
in
all
your
dealings
with
cheating
and
misleading
your
customers
attempting
to
cheat
and
betray
your
friends
and
breaking
all
the
rules
of
civilised
crime
you
are
not
invited
to
plead
either
way
because
this
court
would
not
attach
the
slightest
value
to
your
plea
but
presently
you
will
get
an
opportunity
of
addressing
the
court
in
mitigation
of
your
sentence
or
if
you
like
continued
raffles
with
a
wink
at
me
you
may
be
represented
by
counsel
my
learned
friend
here
i
sure
will
be
proud
to
undertake
your
defence
as
a
or
perhaps
i
should
say
a
mr
bunny
and
raffles
laughed
as
coyly
as
a
real
judge
at
a
real
judicial
joke
whereupon
i
joined
in
so
uproariously
as
to
find
myself
degraded
from
the
position
of
leading
counsel
to
that
of
the
general
public
in
a
single
flash
from
the
judge
eye
if
i
hear
any
more
laughter
said
raffles
i
shall
clear
the
court
it
perfectly
monstrous
that
people
should
come
here
to
a
court
of
justice
and
behave
as
though
they
were
at
a
theatre
levy
had
been
reclining
with
his
yellow
face
twisted
and
his
red
eyes
shut
but
now
these
burst
open
as
with
flames
and
the
dry
lips
spat
a
hearty
curse
at
the
judge
upon
the
locker
take
care
said
raffles
contempt
of
court
wo
do
you
any
good
you
know
and
what
good
will
all
this
foolery
do
you
say
what
you
got
to
say
against
me
and
be
damned
to
you
i
fear
you
confusing
our
functions
sadly
said
raffles
with
a
compassionate
shake
of
the
head
but
so
far
as
your
first
exhortation
goes
i
shall
endeavour
to
take
you
at
your
word
you
are
a
trading
among
other
places
in
jermyn
street
james
under
the
style
and
title
of
daniel
levy
it
to
be
my
name
that
i
can
well
believe
rejoined
raffles
and
if
i
may
say
so
levy
i
respect
you
for
it
you
do
call
yourself
macgregor
or
montgomery
you
do
sail
under
false
colours
at
all
you
fly
the
skull
and
crossbones
of
daniel
levy
and
it
one
of
the
points
that
distinguish
you
from
the
ruck
of
and
put
you
in
a
class
by
yourself
unfortunately
the
other
points
are
not
so
creditable
if
you
are
more
brazen
than
most
you
are
also
more
unscrupulous
if
you
fly
at
higher
game
you
descend
to
lower
dodges
you
may
be
the
biggest
man
alive
at
your
job
you
are
certainly
the
biggest
villain
but
i
up
against
a
bigger
now
said
levy
shifting
his
position
and
closing
his
crimson
eyes
possibly
said
raffles
as
he
produced
a
long
envelope
and
unfolded
a
sheet
of
foolscap
but
permit
me
to
remind
you
of
a
few
of
your
own
proven
villainies
before
you
take
any
more
shots
at
mine
last
year
you
had
three
of
your
great
bargains
set
aside
by
the
law
as
hard
and
unconscionable
but
every
year
you
have
these
cases
and
at
best
the
terms
are
modified
in
favour
of
your
wretched
client
but
it
only
the
exception
who
will
face
the
music
of
the
and
the
press
and
you
figure
on
the
general
run
you
prefer
people
like
the
lincolnshire
vicar
you
hounded
into
an
asylum
the
year
before
last
you
cherish
the
memory
of
the
seven
poor
devils
that
you
drove
to
suicide
between
and
that
sort
pay
the
uttermost
farthing
before
the
debt
to
nature
you
set
great
store
by
the
impoverished
gentry
and
nobility
who
have
you
to
stay
with
them
when
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
and
secure
a
respite
in
exchange
for
introductions
to
their
pals
no
fish
is
too
large
for
your
net
and
none
is
too
small
from
his
highness
of
hathipur
to
that
poor
little
builder
at
bromley
who
cut
the
throats
stop
it
cried
levy
in
a
lather
of
impotent
rage
by
all
means
said
raffles
restoring
the
paper
to
its
envelope
an
ugly
little
load
for
one
man
soul
i
admit
but
you
must
see
it
was
about
time
somebody
beat
you
at
your
own
beastly
game
it
a
pack
of
blithering
lies
retorted
levy
and
you
have
beaten
me
yet
stick
to
facts
within
your
own
knowledge
and
then
tell
me
if
your
precious
garlands
have
brought
their
troubles
on
themselves
certainly
they
have
said
raffles
but
it
is
your
treatment
of
the
garlands
that
has
brought
you
to
this
pretty
pass
what
is
it
then
your
treatment
of
me
mr
levy
a
cursed
crook
like
you
a
party
to
a
pretty
definite
bargain
however
and
a
discredited
person
only
so
far
as
that
bargain
is
concerned
and
the
rest
said
the
jeering
feebly
i
know
more
about
you
than
you
guess
i
should
have
put
it
the
other
way
round
replied
raffles
smiling
but
we
are
both
forgetting
ourselves
prisoner
in
the
bunk
kindly
note
that
your
trial
is
resumed
and
further
contempt
will
not
be
allowed
to
go
unpurged
you
referred
a
moment
ago
to
my
unfortunate
friends
you
say
they
were
the
engineers
of
their
own
misfortunes
that
might
be
said
of
all
who
ever
put
themselves
in
your
clutches
you
squeeze
them
as
hard
as
the
law
will
let
you
and
in
this
case
i
do
see
how
the
law
is
to
interfere
so
i
interfere
myself
in
the
first
instance
as
disastrously
as
you
please
you
did
so
exclaimed
levy
with
a
flicker
of
his
inflamed
eyes
you
brought
things
to
a
head
that
all
did
on
the
contrary
you
and
i
came
to
an
agreement
which
still
holds
good
said
raffles
significantly
you
are
to
return
me
a
certain
note
of
hand
for
thirteen
thousand
and
odd
pounds
taken
in
exchange
for
a
loan
of
ten
thousand
and
you
are
also
to
give
an
understanding
to
leave
another
fifteen
thousand
of
yours
on
mortgage
for
another
year
at
least
instead
of
foreclosing
as
you
threatened
and
had
a
right
to
do
this
week
that
was
your
side
of
the
bargain
well
said
levy
and
when
did
i
go
back
on
it
my
side
continued
raffles
ignoring
the
interpolation
was
to
get
you
by
hook
or
crook
a
certain
letter
which
you
say
you
never
wrote
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
only
to
be
got
by
crook
aha
i
got
hold
of
it
nevertheless
i
brought
it
to
you
at
your
house
last
night
and
you
instantly
destroyed
it
after
as
foul
an
attack
as
one
man
ever
made
upon
another
raffles
had
risen
in
his
wrath
was
towering
over
the
prostrate
prisoner
forgetful
of
the
mock
trial
dead
even
to
the
humour
which
he
himself
had
infused
into
a
sufficiently
lurid
situation
but
quite
terribly
alive
to
the
act
of
treachery
and
violence
which
had
brought
that
situation
about
and
i
must
say
that
levy
looked
no
less
alive
to
his
own
enormity
he
quailed
in
his
bonds
with
a
guilty
fearfulness
strange
to
witness
in
so
truculent
a
brute
and
it
was
with
something
near
a
quaver
that
his
voice
came
next
i
know
that
was
wrong
the
poor
devil
owned
i
very
sorry
for
it
i
sure
but
you
would
trust
me
with
my
own
property
and
that
and
the
drink
together
made
me
mad
so
you
acknowledge
the
alcoholic
influence
at
last
oh
yes
i
must
have
been
as
drunk
as
an
owl
you
know
you
been
suggesting
that
we
drugged
you
not
seriously
raffles
i
knew
the
old
stale
taste
too
well
it
must
have
been
the
best
part
of
a
bottle
i
had
before
you
got
down
in
your
anxiety
to
see
me
safe
and
sound
that
it
with
the
letter
you
never
dreamt
of
playing
me
false
until
i
hesitated
to
let
you
handle
it
never
for
one
moment
my
dear
raffles
raffles
was
still
standing
up
to
his
last
inch
under
the
apex
of
the
tower
his
head
and
shoulders
the
butt
of
a
climbing
sunbeam
full
of
fretful
motes
i
could
not
see
his
expression
from
the
banisters
but
only
its
effect
upon
dan
levy
who
first
held
up
his
manacled
hands
in
hypocritical
protestation
and
then
dropped
them
as
though
it
were
a
bad
job
then
why
said
raffles
did
you
have
me
watched
almost
from
the
moment
that
we
parted
company
at
the
albany
last
friday
morning
have
you
watched
exclaimed
the
other
in
real
horror
why
should
i
it
must
have
been
the
police
it
was
not
the
police
though
the
blackguards
did
their
best
to
look
as
if
they
were
i
happen
to
be
too
familiar
with
both
classes
to
be
deceived
your
fellows
were
waiting
for
me
up
at
lord
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
shaking
them
off
when
i
got
back
to
the
albany
they
gave
me
no
further
trouble
until
last
night
when
they
got
on
my
tracks
at
gray
inn
in
the
guise
of
the
two
common
low
detectives
whom
i
believe
i
have
already
mentioned
to
you
you
said
you
left
them
there
in
their
glory
it
was
glorious
from
my
point
of
view
rather
than
theirs
levy
struggled
into
a
less
recumbent
posture
and
what
makes
you
think
said
he
that
i
set
this
watch
upon
you
i
do
think
returned
raffles
i
know
and
how
the
devil
do
you
know
raffles
answered
with
a
slow
smile
and
a
still
slower
shake
of
the
head
you
really
must
ask
me
to
give
everybody
away
mr
levy
the
swore
an
oath
of
sheer
incredulous
surprise
but
checked
himself
at
that
and
tried
one
more
poser
and
what
do
you
suppose
was
my
object
in
having
you
watched
if
it
was
to
ensure
your
safety
it
might
have
been
to
make
doubly
sure
of
the
letter
and
to
cut
down
expenses
at
the
same
swoop
by
knocking
me
on
the
head
and
abstracting
the
treasure
from
my
person
it
was
a
jolly
cunning
idea
prisoner
in
the
bunk
i
should
be
upset
about
it
just
because
it
did
come
off
my
compliments
especially
on
making
up
your
varlets
in
the
quite
colourable
image
of
the
true
detective
if
they
had
fallen
upon
me
and
it
had
been
a
case
of
my
liberty
or
your
letter
you
know
well
enough
which
i
should
let
go
but
levy
had
fallen
back
upon
his
pillow
of
folded
flag
and
the
red
ensign
over
him
bubbled
and
heaved
with
his
impotent
paroxysms
they
told
you
they
must
have
told
you
he
ground
out
through
his
teeth
the
traitors
the
blasted
traitors
it
a
catching
complaint
you
see
levy
said
raffles
especially
when
one
elders
and
betters
themselves
succumb
to
it
but
they
such
liars
cried
levy
shifting
his
ground
again
you
see
what
liars
they
are
i
did
set
them
to
watch
you
but
for
your
own
good
as
i
just
been
telling
you
i
was
so
afraid
something
might
to
you
they
were
there
to
see
that
nothing
did
now
do
you
spot
their
game
i
got
to
take
the
skunks
into
the
secret
more
or
less
they
played
it
double
on
us
both
meant
bagging
the
letter
from
you
to
blackmail
me
with
it
that
what
they
meant
of
course
when
they
failed
to
bring
it
off
they
pitch
any
yarn
to
you
but
that
was
their
game
all
right
you
must
see
for
yourself
it
could
never
have
been
mine
raffles
and
and
let
me
out
o
this
like
a
good
feller
is
this
your
defence
asked
raffles
as
he
resumed
his
seat
on
the
judicial
locker
is
it
your
own
the
other
asked
in
his
turn
with
an
eager
removal
of
all
resentment
from
his
manner
we
both
been
got
at
by
those
two
jackets
of
course
i
was
sorry
ever
to
trusted
an
inch
and
you
were
quite
right
to
serve
me
as
you
did
if
what
they
been
telling
you
been
the
truth
but
now
you
see
it
was
all
a
pack
of
lies
surely
about
time
to
stop
treating
me
like
a
mad
dog
then
you
really
mean
to
stand
by
your
side
of
the
original
arrangement
always
did
declared
our
captive
never
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
anything
else
then
where
the
first
thing
you
promised
me
in
fair
exchange
for
what
you
destroyed
last
night
where
garland
note
of
hand
in
my
and
that
in
my
pocket
in
case
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
murmured
raffles
in
sly
commentary
and
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
me
what
that
do
you
believe
me
i
it
over
this
minute
if
only
you
take
these
damned
things
off
my
wrists
there
no
excuse
for
now
you
know
raffles
shook
his
head
i
rather
not
trust
myself
within
reach
of
your
raw
fists
yet
prisoner
but
my
marshal
will
produce
the
note
from
your
person
if
it
there
it
was
there
in
a
swollen
which
i
replaced
otherwise
intact
while
raffles
compared
the
signature
on
the
note
of
hand
with
samples
which
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
it
genuine
enough
said
levy
with
a
sudden
snarl
and
a
lethal
look
that
i
intercepted
at
close
quarters
so
i
perceive
said
raffles
and
now
i
require
an
equally
genuine
signature
to
this
little
document
which
is
also
a
part
of
your
bond
the
little
document
turned
out
to
be
a
veritable
deed
engrossed
on
parchment
embossed
with
a
stamp
and
duly
calling
itself
an
indenture
in
fourteenth
century
capitals
so
much
i
saw
as
i
held
it
up
for
the
prisoner
to
read
over
the
illegally
legal
instrument
is
still
in
existence
with
its
unpunctuated
jargon
about
hereditaments
and
fee
simple
its
and
whereas
the
said
daniel
levy
in
every
other
line
and
its
eventual
plain
provision
for
the
said
sum
of
to
remain
charged
upon
the
security
of
the
hereditaments
in
the
said
recited
indenture
until
the
expiration
of
one
year
computed
from
that
summer
day
in
that
empty
tower
the
whole
thing
had
been
properly
and
innocently
prepared
by
old
mother
hubbard
the
little
solicitor
whom
raffles
had
mentioned
as
having
been
in
our
house
at
school
from
a
copy
of
the
original
mortgage
deed
supplied
in
equal
innocence
by
garland
i
sometimes
wonder
what
those
worthy
citizens
would
have
said
if
they
had
dreamt
for
a
moment
under
what
conditions
of
acute
duress
their
deed
was
to
be
signed
signed
it
was
however
and
with
less
demur
than
might
have
been
expected
of
so
inveterate
a
fighter
as
dan
levy
but
his
one
remaining
course
was
obviously
the
line
of
least
resistance
no
other
would
square
with
his
ingenious
repudiation
of
the
charge
of
treachery
to
raffles
much
less
with
his
repeated
protestations
that
he
had
always
intended
to
perform
his
part
of
their
agreement
it
was
to
his
immediate
interest
to
convince
us
of
his
good
faith
and
up
to
this
point
he
might
well
have
thought
he
had
succeeded
in
so
doing
raffles
had
concealed
his
full
knowledge
of
the
creature
duplicity
had
enjoyed
leading
him
on
from
lie
to
lie
and
i
had
enjoyed
listening
almost
as
much
as
i
now
delighted
in
the
dilemma
in
which
levy
had
landed
himself
for
either
he
must
sign
and
look
pleasant
or
else
abandon
his
innocent
posture
altogether
and
so
he
looked
as
pleasant
as
he
could
and
signed
in
his
handcuffs
with
but
the
shadow
of
a
fight
for
their
immediate
removal
and
now
said
levy
when
i
had
duly
witnessed
his
signature
i
think
i
about
earned
that
little
drop
of
my
own
champagne
not
quite
yet
replied
raffles
in
a
tone
like
thin
ice
we
are
only
at
the
point
we
should
have
reached
the
moment
i
arrived
at
your
house
last
night
you
have
now
done
under
compulsion
what
you
had
agreed
to
do
of
your
own
free
will
then
levy
lay
back
in
the
bunk
plunged
in
billows
of
incongruous
bunting
with
fallen
jaw
and
fiery
eyes
an
equal
blend
of
anger
and
alarm
but
i
told
you
i
was
myself
last
night
he
whined
i
said
i
was
very
sorry
for
all
i
done
but
ca
remember
doing
i
say
it
again
from
the
bottom
of
my
i
no
doubt
you
do
said
raffles
but
what
you
did
after
our
arrival
was
nothing
to
what
you
had
already
done
it
was
only
the
last
of
those
acts
of
treachery
for
which
you
are
still
on
your
trial
prisoner
in
the
bunk
but
i
thought
i
explained
all
the
rest
cried
the
prisoner
in
a
palsy
of
impotent
rage
and
disappointment
you
have
said
raffles
in
the
sense
of
making
your
perfidy
even
plainer
than
it
was
before
come
levy
i
know
every
move
made
and
the
game
been
up
longer
than
you
think
you
wo
score
a
point
by
telling
lies
that
contradict
each
other
and
aggravate
your
guilt
have
you
nothing
better
to
say
why
the
sentence
of
the
court
should
not
be
passed
upon
you
a
sullen
silence
was
broken
by
a
more
precise
and
staccato
repetition
of
the
question
and
then
to
my
amazement
i
beheld
the
gross
lower
lip
of
levy
actually
trembling
and
a
distressing
flicker
of
the
inflamed
eyelids
i
felt
you
swindled
me
he
quavered
out
and
i
thought
swindle
you
bravo
cried
raffles
that
the
first
honest
thing
you
said
let
me
tell
you
for
your
encouragement
that
it
reduces
your
punishment
by
per
cent
you
will
nevertheless
pay
a
fine
of
fifteen
hundred
pounds
for
your
latest
little
effort
in
low
treason
though
not
unprepared
for
some
such
ultimatum
i
must
own
i
heard
it
with
dismay
on
all
sorts
of
grounds
some
of
them
as
unworthy
as
itself
this
last
demand
failed
to
meet
with
my
approval
and
i
determined
to
expostulate
with
raffles
before
it
was
too
late
meanwhile
i
hid
my
feelings
as
best
i
could
and
admired
the
spirit
with
which
dan
levy
expressed
his
i
see
you
damned
first
he
cried
it
blackmail
guineas
said
raffles
for
contempt
of
court
and
more
to
my
surprise
than
ever
not
a
little
indeed
to
my
secret
disappointment
our
captive
speedily
collapsed
again
whimpering
moaning
gnashing
his
teeth
and
clutching
at
the
red
ensign
with
closed
eyes
and
distorted
face
so
much
as
though
he
were
about
to
have
a
fit
that
i
caught
up
the
of
champagne
and
began
removing
the
wire
at
a
nod
from
raffles
do
cut
the
string
just
yet
he
added
however
with
an
eye
on
levy
who
instantly
opened
his
i
pay
up
he
whispered
feebly
yet
eagerly
it
serves
me
right
i
promise
i
pay
up
good
said
raffles
here
your
own
from
your
own
room
and
here
my
fountain
pen
you
wo
take
my
word
it
quite
enough
to
have
to
take
your
cheque
it
should
have
been
hard
cash
so
it
shall
be
raffles
if
you
come
up
with
me
to
my
office
i
dare
say
to
my
bank
then
i
prefer
to
go
alone
you
will
kindly
make
it
an
open
cheque
payable
to
bearer
the
fountain
pen
was
poised
over
the
chequebook
but
only
because
i
had
placed
it
in
levy
fingers
and
was
holding
the
under
them
and
what
if
i
refuse
he
demanded
with
a
last
flash
of
his
native
spirit
we
shall
say
and
give
you
until
all
day
to
call
for
help
in
muttered
levy
all
but
to
himself
do
you
happen
to
know
where
you
are
raffles
asked
him
no
but
i
can
find
out
if
you
knew
already
you
would
also
know
that
you
might
call
till
you
were
black
in
the
face
but
to
keep
you
in
blissful
ignorance
you
will
be
bound
a
good
deal
more
securely
than
you
are
at
present
and
to
spare
your
poor
voice
you
will
also
be
very
thoroughly
gagged
levy
took
remarkably
little
notice
of
either
threat
or
gibe
and
if
i
give
in
and
sign
said
he
after
a
pause
you
will
remain
exactly
as
you
are
with
one
of
us
to
keep
you
company
while
the
other
goes
up
to
town
to
cash
your
cheque
you
ca
expect
me
to
give
you
a
chance
of
stopping
it
you
know
this
again
struck
me
as
a
hard
condition
if
only
prudent
when
one
came
to
think
of
it
from
our
point
of
view
still
it
took
even
me
by
surprise
and
i
expected
levy
to
fling
away
the
pen
in
disgust
he
balanced
it
however
as
though
also
weighing
the
two
alternatives
very
carefully
in
his
mind
and
during
his
deliberations
his
bloodshot
eyes
wandered
from
raffles
to
me
and
back
again
to
raffles
in
a
word
the
latest
prospect
appeared
to
disturb
levy
less
than
for
obvious
reasons
it
did
me
certainly
for
him
it
was
the
lesser
of
the
two
evils
and
as
such
he
seemed
to
accept
it
when
he
finally
wrote
out
the
cheque
for
fifteen
hundred
guineas
raffles
insisting
on
these
and
signed
it
firmly
before
sinking
back
as
though
exhausted
by
the
effort
raffles
was
as
good
as
his
word
about
the
champagne
now
dram
by
dram
he
poured
the
whole
pint
into
the
cup
belonging
to
his
flask
and
dram
by
dram
our
prisoner
tossed
it
off
but
with
closed
eyes
like
a
delirious
invalid
and
towards
the
end
with
a
head
so
heavy
that
raffles
had
to
raise
it
from
the
rolled
flag
though
foul
talons
still
came
twitching
out
for
more
it
was
an
unlovely
process
i
will
confess
but
what
was
a
pint
as
raffles
said
at
any
rate
i
could
bear
him
out
that
these
potations
had
not
been
hocussed
and
raffles
whispered
the
same
for
the
flask
which
he
handed
me
with
revolver
at
the
head
of
the
wooden
stairs
i
coming
down
said
i
for
a
word
with
you
in
the
room
below
raffles
looked
at
me
with
open
eyes
then
more
narrowly
at
the
red
lids
of
levy
and
finally
at
his
own
watch
very
well
bunny
but
i
must
cut
and
run
for
my
train
in
about
a
minute
there
a
which
would
get
me
to
the
bank
before
eleven
and
back
here
by
one
or
two
why
go
to
the
bank
at
all
i
asked
him
in
the
lower
room
to
cash
his
cheque
before
he
has
a
chance
of
stopping
it
would
you
like
to
go
instead
of
me
bunny
no
thank
you
well
do
get
hot
about
it
you
got
the
better
billet
of
the
two
the
softer
one
perhaps
infinitely
bunny
with
the
old
bird
full
of
his
own
champagne
and
his
own
revolver
in
your
pocket
or
your
hand
the
worst
he
can
do
is
to
start
yelling
out
and
i
really
do
believe
that
not
a
soul
would
hear
him
if
he
did
the
gardeners
are
always
at
work
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
road
a
passing
boatload
is
the
only
danger
and
i
doubt
if
even
they
would
hear
my
billet
all
right
said
i
valiantly
it
yours
that
worries
me
mine
cried
raffles
with
an
almost
merry
laugh
my
dear
good
bunny
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
about
my
little
bit
of
course
it
take
some
doing
at
the
bank
i
do
say
it
a
straight
part
there
but
trust
me
to
play
it
on
my
head
raffles
i
said
in
a
low
voice
that
may
have
trembled
it
not
a
part
for
you
to
play
at
all
i
do
mean
the
little
bit
at
the
bank
i
mean
this
whole
blackmailing
part
of
the
business
it
not
like
you
raffles
it
spoils
the
whole
thing
i
had
got
it
off
my
chest
without
a
hitch
but
so
far
raffles
had
not
discouraged
me
there
was
a
look
on
his
face
which
even
made
me
think
that
he
agreed
with
me
in
his
heart
both
hardened
as
he
thought
it
over
it
levy
who
spoilt
the
whole
thing
he
rejoined
obdurately
in
the
end
he
been
playing
me
false
all
the
time
and
he
got
to
pay
for
it
but
you
never
meant
to
make
anything
out
of
him
well
i
do
now
and
i
told
you
why
why
should
i
because
it
not
your
game
i
cried
with
all
the
eager
persuasion
in
my
power
because
it
the
sort
of
thing
dan
levy
would
do
himself
it
game
all
right
it
simply
drags
you
down
to
his
level
but
there
he
stopped
me
with
a
look
and
not
the
kind
of
look
i
often
had
from
raffles
it
was
no
new
feat
of
mine
to
make
him
angry
scornful
bitterly
cynical
or
sarcastic
this
however
was
a
look
of
pain
and
even
shame
as
though
he
had
suddenly
seen
himself
in
a
new
and
peculiarly
unlovely
light
down
to
it
he
exclaimed
with
an
irony
that
was
not
for
me
as
though
there
could
be
a
much
lower
level
than
mine
do
you
know
bunny
i
sometimes
think
my
moral
sense
is
ahead
of
yours
i
could
have
laughed
outright
but
the
humour
that
was
the
salt
of
him
seemed
suddenly
to
have
gone
out
of
raffles
i
know
what
i
am
said
he
but
i
afraid
you
getting
a
hopeless
it
not
the
villain
i
care
about
i
answered
meaning
every
word
it
the
sportsman
behind
the
villain
as
you
know
perfectly
well
i
know
the
villain
behind
the
sportsman
rather
better
replied
raffles
laughing
when
i
least
expected
it
but
you
by
way
of
forgetting
his
existence
altogether
i
should
wonder
if
some
day
you
wrote
me
up
into
a
heavy
hero
bunny
and
made
me
turn
in
my
quicklime
let
this
remind
you
what
i
always
was
and
shall
be
to
the
end
and
he
took
my
hand
as
i
fondly
hoped
in
surrender
to
my
appeal
to
those
better
feelings
which
i
knew
i
had
for
once
succeeded
in
quickening
within
him
but
it
was
only
to
bid
me
a
mischievous
goodbye
ere
he
ran
down
the
spiral
stair
leaving
me
to
listen
till
i
lost
his
feathery
in
the
base
of
the
tower
and
then
to
mount
guard
over
my
tethered
handcuffed
somnolent
and
yet
always
formidable
prisoner
at
the
top
chapter
xvi
watch
and
ward
i
well
remember
as
i
set
reluctant
foot
upon
the
wooden
stair
taking
a
last
and
somewhat
lingering
look
at
the
dust
and
dirt
of
the
lower
chamber
as
one
who
knew
not
what
might
happen
before
he
saw
it
again
the
stain
as
of
red
rust
in
the
lavatory
basin
the
gritty
deposit
in
the
bath
the
verdigris
on
all
the
taps
the
foul
opacity
of
the
windows
are
among
the
trivialities
that
somehow
stamped
themselves
upon
my
mind
one
of
the
windows
was
open
at
the
top
had
been
so
long
open
that
the
aperture
was
curtained
with
cobwebs
at
each
extremity
but
in
between
i
got
quite
a
poignant
picture
of
the
thames
as
i
went
upstairs
it
was
only
a
sinuous
perspective
of
sunlit
ripples
twinkling
between
wooded
gardens
and
open
meadows
a
fisherman
or
two
upon
the
a
canoe
in
a
gaunt
church
crowning
all
against
the
sky
but
inset
in
such
surroundings
it
was
like
a
flash
from
a
in
a
and
very
loth
was
i
to
exchange
that
sunny
peep
for
an
indefinite
prospect
of
my
prisoner
person
at
close
quarters
yet
the
first
stage
of
my
vigil
proved
such
a
sinecure
as
to
give
me
some
confidence
for
all
the
rest
dan
levy
opened
neither
his
lips
nor
his
eyes
at
my
approach
but
lay
on
his
back
with
the
red
ensign
drawn
up
to
his
chin
and
the
peaceful
countenance
of
profound
oblivion
i
remember
taking
a
good
look
at
him
and
thinking
that
his
face
improved
remarkably
in
repose
that
in
death
he
might
look
fine
the
forehead
was
higher
and
broader
than
i
had
realised
the
thick
lips
were
firm
enough
now
but
the
closing
of
the
crafty
little
eyes
was
the
greatest
gain
of
all
on
the
whole
not
only
a
better
but
a
stronger
face
than
it
had
been
all
the
morning
a
more
formidable
face
by
far
but
the
man
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
bonds
and
forgotten
them
he
would
wake
up
abject
enough
if
not
i
had
the
means
to
reduce
him
to
docility
meanwhile
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
show
my
power
but
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
locker
and
took
my
seat
by
inches
levy
did
not
move
a
muscle
no
sound
escaped
him
either
and
somehow
or
other
i
should
have
expected
him
to
snore
indeed
it
might
have
come
as
a
relief
for
the
silence
of
the
tower
soon
got
upon
my
nerves
it
was
not
a
complete
silence
that
was
and
always
is
the
worst
of
it
the
wooden
stairs
creaked
more
than
once
there
were
little
rattlings
faint
and
distant
as
of
a
dried
leaf
or
a
loose
window
in
the
bowels
of
the
house
and
though
nothing
came
of
any
of
these
noises
except
a
fresh
period
of
tension
on
my
part
they
made
the
skin
act
on
my
forehead
every
time
then
i
remember
a
real
anxiety
over
a
that
must
have
come
in
through
the
open
window
just
below
for
suddenly
it
buzzed
into
my
ken
and
looked
like
attacking
levy
on
the
spot
somehow
i
slew
it
with
less
noise
than
the
brute
itself
was
making
and
not
until
after
that
breathless
achievement
did
i
realise
how
anxious
i
was
to
keep
my
prisoner
asleep
yet
i
had
the
revolver
and
he
lay
handcuffed
and
bound
down
it
was
in
the
next
long
silence
that
i
became
sensitive
to
another
sound
which
indeed
i
had
heard
at
intervals
already
only
to
dismiss
it
from
my
mind
as
one
of
the
signs
of
extraneous
life
which
were
bound
to
penetrate
even
to
the
top
of
my
tower
it
was
a
slow
and
regular
beat
as
of
a
in
a
distant
forge
or
some
sort
of
machinery
only
audible
when
there
was
absolutely
nothing
else
to
be
heard
it
could
hardly
be
near
at
hand
for
i
could
not
hear
it
properly
unless
i
held
my
breath
then
however
it
was
always
there
a
sound
that
never
ceased
or
altered
so
that
in
the
end
i
sat
and
listened
to
it
and
nothing
else
i
was
not
even
looking
at
levy
when
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
what
it
was
his
voice
was
quiet
and
civil
enough
but
it
undoubtedly
made
me
jump
and
that
brought
a
malicious
twinkle
into
the
little
eyes
that
looked
as
though
they
had
been
studying
me
at
their
leisure
they
were
perhaps
less
violently
bloodshot
than
before
the
massive
features
calm
and
strong
as
they
had
been
in
slumber
or
its
artful
counterfeit
i
thought
you
were
asleep
i
snapped
and
knew
better
for
certain
before
he
spoke
you
see
that
pint
o
pop
did
me
prouder
than
intended
he
explained
it
made
a
new
man
o
me
you
be
sorry
to
i
should
have
been
sorrier
to
believe
it
but
i
did
not
say
so
or
anything
else
just
then
the
dull
and
distant
beat
came
back
to
the
ear
and
levy
again
inquired
if
i
knew
what
it
was
do
you
i
demanded
rather
he
replied
with
cheerful
certitude
it
the
clock
of
course
what
clock
the
one
on
the
tower
a
bit
lower
down
facing
the
road
how
do
know
i
demanded
with
uneasy
credulity
my
good
young
man
said
dan
levy
i
know
the
face
of
that
clock
as
well
as
i
know
the
inside
of
this
tower
then
you
do
know
where
you
are
i
cried
in
such
surprise
that
levy
grinned
in
a
way
that
ill
became
a
captive
why
said
he
i
sold
the
last
tenant
up
and
nearly
took
the
myself
instead
o
the
place
i
got
it
was
what
first
attracted
me
to
the
why
could
you
tell
us
the
truth
before
i
demanded
but
my
warmth
merely
broadened
his
grin
why
should
i
it
sometimes
pays
to
seem
more
at
a
loss
than
you
are
it
wo
in
this
case
said
i
through
my
teeth
but
for
all
my
austerity
and
all
his
bonds
the
prisoner
continued
to
regard
me
with
quiet
but
most
disquieting
amusement
i
not
so
sure
of
that
he
observed
at
length
it
rather
paid
to
my
way
of
thinking
when
raffles
went
off
to
cash
my
cheque
and
left
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
oh
did
it
said
i
with
pregnant
emphasis
and
my
right
hand
found
comfort
in
my
jacket
pocket
on
the
butt
of
the
old
brute
own
weapon
i
only
mean
he
rejoined
in
a
more
conciliatory
voice
that
you
strike
me
as
being
more
open
to
reason
than
your
flash
friend
i
said
nothing
to
that
on
the
other
continued
levy
still
more
deliberately
as
though
he
really
was
comparing
us
in
his
mind
on
the
other
stooping
to
pick
up
what
he
had
dropped
you
do
take
so
many
risks
raffles
takes
so
many
that
he
bound
to
land
you
both
in
the
jug
some
day
if
he
has
done
it
this
time
i
believe
he
has
myself
but
it
no
use
hollering
before
you
out
o
the
wood
i
agreed
with
more
confidence
than
i
felt
yet
i
wonder
he
never
thought
of
it
my
prisoner
went
on
as
if
to
himself
thought
of
what
only
the
clock
he
must
seen
it
before
if
you
never
did
you
tell
me
this
little
bit
o
kidnapping
was
a
sudden
idea
it
all
been
thought
out
and
the
ground
gone
over
and
the
clock
seen
as
i
say
seen
going
yet
it
never
strikes
our
flash
friend
that
a
going
clock
got
to
be
wound
up
once
a
week
and
it
might
be
as
well
to
find
out
which
day
how
do
you
know
he
did
because
this
to
be
the
day
and
levy
lay
back
in
the
bunk
with
the
internal
chuckle
that
i
was
beginning
to
know
so
well
but
had
little
thought
to
hear
from
him
in
his
present
predicament
it
galled
me
the
more
because
i
felt
that
raffles
would
certainly
not
have
heard
it
in
my
place
but
at
least
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
flatly
and
profanely
refusing
to
believe
the
statement
that
be
blowed
for
a
bluff
was
more
or
less
what
i
said
it
too
much
of
a
coincidence
to
be
anything
else
the
odds
are
only
six
to
one
against
it
said
levy
indifferently
one
of
you
takes
them
with
his
eyes
open
it
seems
rather
a
pity
that
the
other
should
feel
bound
to
follow
him
to
certain
ruin
but
i
suppose
you
know
your
own
business
best
at
all
events
i
boasted
i
know
better
than
to
be
bluffed
by
the
most
obvious
lie
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
you
tell
me
how
you
know
about
the
man
coming
to
wind
the
clock
and
i
may
listen
to
you
i
know
because
i
know
the
man
little
scotchman
he
is
nothing
to
run
away
from
though
he
looks
as
hard
as
nails
what
there
is
of
him
said
levy
in
a
circumstantial
and
impartial
flow
that
could
not
but
carry
some
conviction
he
comes
over
from
kingston
every
tuesday
on
his
bike
some
time
before
lunch
he
comes
and
sees
to
my
own
clocks
on
the
same
trip
that
how
i
know
but
you
need
believe
me
if
you
do
like
and
where
exactly
does
he
come
to
wind
this
clock
i
see
nothing
that
can
possibly
have
to
do
with
it
up
here
no
said
levy
he
comes
no
higher
than
the
floor
below
i
seemed
to
remember
a
kind
of
cupboard
at
the
head
of
the
spiral
stair
but
near
enough
you
mean
that
we
shall
hear
him
and
he
us
added
levy
with
unmistakable
determination
look
here
levy
said
i
showing
him
his
own
revolver
if
we
do
hear
anybody
i
shall
hold
this
to
your
head
and
if
he
does
hear
us
i
shall
blow
out
your
beastly
brains
the
mere
feeling
that
i
was
perhaps
the
last
person
capable
of
any
such
deed
enabled
me
to
grind
out
this
shocking
threat
in
a
voice
worthy
of
it
and
with
a
face
i
hoped
not
less
in
keeping
it
was
all
the
more
mortifying
when
dan
levy
treated
my
tragedy
as
farce
in
fact
if
anything
could
have
made
me
as
bad
as
my
word
it
would
have
been
the
guttural
laugh
with
which
he
greeted
it
excuse
me
said
he
dabbing
his
red
eyes
with
the
edge
of
the
red
bunting
but
the
thought
of
your
letting
that
thing
off
in
order
to
preserve
silence
why
it
as
droll
as
your
whole
attempt
to
play
the
villain
i
shall
play
him
to
some
purpose
i
hissed
if
you
drive
me
to
it
i
laid
you
out
last
night
remember
and
for
two
pins
i
do
the
same
thing
again
this
morning
so
now
you
know
that
was
in
cold
blood
said
levy
rolling
his
head
from
side
to
side
that
was
when
the
lot
of
us
were
brawling
in
our
cups
i
count
that
you
in
a
false
position
my
dear
sir
i
do
mean
last
night
or
this
morning
though
i
can
see
that
you
no
brigand
or
blackmailer
at
bottom
and
i
should
wonder
if
you
never
forgave
raffles
for
letting
you
in
for
this
part
of
this
job
but
that
is
what
i
mean
you
got
in
with
a
villain
but
you
ai
one
yourself
that
where
you
in
the
false
position
the
magsman
you
only
the
swell
can
see
that
but
the
judge
wo
you
both
get
served
the
same
and
in
your
case
it
be
a
thousand
shames
he
had
propped
himself
on
one
elbow
and
was
speaking
eagerly
persuasively
with
almost
a
fatherly
solicitude
yet
i
felt
that
both
his
words
and
their
effect
on
me
were
being
weighed
and
measured
with
meticulous
discretion
and
i
encouraged
him
with
a
countenance
as
deliberately
rueful
and
depressed
to
an
end
which
had
only
occurred
to
me
with
the
significance
of
his
altered
tone
i
ca
help
it
i
muttered
i
must
go
through
with
the
whole
thing
now
why
must
you
demanded
levy
you
been
led
into
a
job
that
none
of
your
business
on
of
folks
who
no
friends
of
yours
and
the
job
developed
into
a
serious
crime
and
the
crime
going
to
be
found
out
before
you
an
hour
older
why
go
through
with
it
to
certain
quod
there
nothing
else
for
it
i
answered
with
a
sulky
resignation
though
my
pulse
was
quick
with
eagerness
for
what
i
felt
was
coming
and
then
it
came
why
not
get
out
of
the
whole
thing
suggested
levy
boldly
before
it
too
late
how
can
i
said
i
to
lead
him
on
with
a
more
explicit
proposition
by
first
releasing
me
and
then
clearing
out
yourself
i
looked
at
him
as
though
this
was
certainly
an
idea
as
though
i
were
actually
considering
it
in
spite
of
myself
and
raffles
and
his
eagerness
fed
upon
my
apparent
indecision
he
held
up
his
fettered
hands
begging
and
cajoling
me
to
remove
his
handcuffs
and
i
instead
of
telling
him
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
do
so
until
raffles
returned
pretended
to
hesitate
on
quite
different
grounds
it
all
very
well
i
said
but
are
you
going
to
make
it
worth
my
while
certainly
cried
he
give
me
my
chequebook
out
of
my
own
pocket
where
you
were
good
enough
to
stow
it
before
that
blackguard
left
and
write
you
one
cheque
for
a
hundred
now
and
another
for
another
hundred
before
i
leave
this
tower
you
really
will
i
temporised
i
swear
it
he
asseverated
and
i
still
believe
he
might
have
kept
his
word
about
that
but
now
i
knew
where
he
been
lying
to
me
and
now
was
the
time
to
let
him
know
i
knew
it
two
hundred
pounds
said
i
for
the
liberty
you
are
bound
to
get
for
nothing
as
you
yourself
have
pointed
out
when
the
man
turns
up
to
wind
the
clock
a
couple
of
hundred
to
save
less
than
a
couple
of
hours
levy
changed
colour
as
he
saw
his
mistake
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
sudden
fury
otherwise
his
was
only
less
admirable
than
his
presence
of
mind
it
was
to
save
time
said
he
it
was
to
save
my
face
in
the
neighbourhood
the
found
bound
and
handcuffed
in
an
empty
house
it
means
the
first
laugh
at
my
expense
whoever
has
the
last
laugh
but
you
quite
right
it
was
worth
two
hundred
golden
sovereigns
let
them
laugh
at
any
rate
you
and
your
flash
friend
be
laughing
on
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouths
before
the
day
out
so
all
there
is
to
it
and
you
better
start
screwing
up
your
courage
if
you
want
to
do
me
in
i
did
mean
to
give
you
another
chance
in
life
but
by
god
i
would
now
if
you
were
to
go
down
on
your
knees
for
one
considering
that
he
was
bound
and
i
was
free
that
i
was
armed
and
he
defenceless
there
was
perhaps
more
humour
than
the
prisoner
saw
in
his
picture
of
me
upon
my
knees
to
him
not
that
i
saw
it
all
at
once
myself
i
was
too
busy
wondering
whether
there
could
be
anything
in
his
story
after
all
certainly
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
big
bribe
offered
for
his
immediate
freedom
but
it
was
with
something
more
than
mere
adroitness
that
the
had
reconciled
the
two
things
in
his
place
i
should
have
been
no
less
anxious
to
keep
my
humiliating
experience
a
secret
from
the
world
with
his
means
i
could
conceive
myself
prepared
to
pay
as
dearly
for
such
secrecy
on
the
other
hand
if
his
idea
was
to
stop
the
huge
cheque
already
given
to
raffles
then
there
was
indeed
no
time
to
be
lost
and
the
only
wonder
was
that
levy
should
have
waited
so
long
before
making
overtures
to
me
raffles
had
now
been
gone
a
very
long
time
as
it
seemed
to
me
but
my
watch
had
run
down
and
the
clock
on
the
tower
did
not
strike
why
they
kept
it
going
at
all
was
a
mystery
to
me
but
now
that
dan
levy
was
lying
still
again
with
set
teeth
and
inexorable
eyes
i
heard
it
beating
out
the
seconds
more
than
ever
like
a
distant
sledgehammer
and
sixty
of
these
i
counted
up
into
a
minute
of
such
portentous
duration
that
what
had
seemed
many
hours
to
me
might
easily
have
been
less
than
one
i
only
knew
that
the
sun
which
had
begun
by
pouring
in
at
one
and
out
at
the
other
which
had
bathed
the
prisoner
in
his
bunk
about
the
time
of
his
trial
by
raffles
now
crowned
me
with
fire
if
i
sat
upon
the
locker
and
made
its
varnish
sticky
if
i
did
not
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
fast
becoming
unendurable
in
its
unwholesome
heat
and
sour
stagnation
i
sat
in
my
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
one
got
such
air
as
entered
by
the
open
window
below
levy
had
kicked
off
his
covering
of
scarlet
bunting
with
a
sudden
oath
which
must
have
been
the
only
sound
within
the
tower
for
an
hour
at
least
all
the
rest
of
the
time
he
lay
with
fettered
fists
clenched
upon
his
breast
with
fierce
eyes
fixed
upon
the
top
of
the
bunk
and
something
about
the
whole
man
that
i
was
forced
to
watch
something
indomitable
and
intensely
alert
a
curious
suggestion
of
smouldering
fires
on
the
point
of
leaping
into
flame
i
feared
this
man
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
may
as
well
admit
it
frankly
it
was
not
that
he
was
twice
my
size
for
i
had
the
like
advantage
in
point
of
years
it
was
not
that
i
had
any
reason
to
distrust
the
strength
of
his
bonds
or
the
efficacy
of
the
weapon
in
my
possession
it
was
a
question
of
personality
not
of
material
advantage
or
disadvantage
or
of
physical
fear
at
all
it
was
simply
the
spirit
of
the
man
that
dominated
mine
i
felt
that
my
mere
flesh
and
blood
would
at
any
moment
give
a
good
account
of
his
as
well
they
might
with
the
odds
that
were
on
my
side
yet
that
did
not
lessen
the
sense
of
subtle
and
essential
inferiority
which
grew
upon
my
nerves
with
almost
every
minute
of
that
endless
morning
and
made
me
long
for
the
relief
of
physical
contest
even
on
equal
terms
i
could
have
set
the
old
ruffian
free
and
thrown
his
revolver
out
of
the
window
and
then
said
to
him
come
on
your
weight
against
my
age
and
may
the
devil
take
the
worse
man
instead
i
must
sit
glaring
at
him
to
mask
my
qualms
and
after
much
thinking
about
the
kind
of
conflict
that
could
never
be
in
the
end
came
one
of
a
less
heroic
but
not
less
desperate
type
before
there
was
time
to
think
at
all
levy
had
raised
his
head
ever
so
little
but
yet
enough
for
my
vigilance
i
saw
him
listening
i
listened
too
and
down
below
in
the
core
of
the
tower
i
heard
or
thought
i
heard
a
step
like
a
feather
and
then
after
some
moments
another
but
i
had
spent
those
moments
in
gazing
instinctively
down
the
stair
it
was
the
least
rattle
of
the
handcuffs
that
brought
my
eyes
like
lightning
back
to
the
bunk
and
there
was
levy
with
hollow
palms
about
his
mouth
and
his
mouth
wide
open
for
the
roar
that
my
own
palms
stifled
in
his
throat
indeed
i
had
leapt
upon
him
once
more
like
a
fiend
and
for
an
instant
i
enjoyed
a
shameful
advantage
it
can
hardly
have
lasted
longer
the
brute
first
bit
me
through
the
hand
so
that
i
carry
his
mark
to
this
day
then
with
his
own
hands
he
took
me
by
the
throat
and
i
thought
that
my
last
moments
were
come
he
squeezed
so
hard
that
i
thought
my
windpipe
must
burst
thought
my
eyes
must
leave
their
sockets
it
was
the
grip
of
a
gorilla
and
it
was
accompanied
by
a
spate
of
curses
and
the
grin
of
a
devil
incarnate
all
my
dreams
of
equal
combat
had
not
prepared
me
for
superhuman
power
on
his
part
such
utter
impotence
on
mine
i
tried
to
wrench
myself
from
his
murderous
clasp
and
was
nearly
felled
by
the
top
of
the
bunk
i
hurled
myself
out
sideways
and
out
he
came
after
me
tearing
down
the
peg
to
which
his
handcuffs
were
tethered
that
only
gave
him
the
better
grip
upon
my
throat
and
he
never
relaxed
it
for
an
instant
scrambling
to
his
feet
when
i
staggered
to
mine
for
by
them
alone
was
he
fast
now
to
the
banisters
meanwhile
i
was
feeling
in
an
empty
pocket
for
his
revolver
which
had
fallen
out
as
we
struggled
on
the
floor
i
saw
it
there
now
with
my
starting
eyeballs
kicked
about
by
our
shuffling
feet
i
tried
to
make
a
dive
for
it
but
levy
had
seen
it
also
and
he
kicked
it
through
the
banisters
without
relaxing
his
murderous
hold
i
could
have
sworn
afterwards
that
i
heard
the
weapon
fall
with
a
clatter
on
the
wooden
stairs
but
what
i
still
remember
hearing
most
distinctly
and
feeling
hot
upon
my
face
is
the
stertorous
breathing
that
was
unbroken
by
a
single
syllable
after
the
first
few
seconds
it
was
a
brutal
encounter
not
short
and
sharp
like
the
one
but
horribly
protracted
nor
was
all
the
brutality
by
any
means
on
one
side
neither
will
i
pretend
that
i
was
getting
much
more
than
my
deserts
in
the
defeat
that
threatened
to
end
in
my
extinction
not
for
an
instant
had
my
enemy
loosened
his
deadly
clutch
and
now
he
had
me
penned
against
the
banisters
and
my
one
hope
was
that
they
would
give
way
before
our
united
weight
and
precipitate
us
both
into
the
room
below
that
would
be
better
than
being
slowly
throttled
even
if
it
were
only
a
better
death
other
chance
there
was
none
and
i
was
actually
trying
to
fling
myself
over
beating
the
air
with
both
hands
wildly
when
one
of
them
closed
upon
the
butt
of
the
revolver
that
i
thought
had
been
kicked
into
the
room
below
i
was
too
far
gone
to
realise
that
a
miracle
had
happened
to
be
so
much
as
puzzled
by
it
then
but
i
was
not
too
far
gone
to
use
that
revolver
and
to
use
it
as
i
would
have
done
on
cool
reflection
i
thrust
it
under
my
opponent
armpit
and
i
fired
through
into
space
the
report
was
deafening
it
did
its
work
levy
let
go
of
me
and
staggered
back
as
though
i
had
really
shot
him
and
that
instant
i
was
brandishing
his
weapon
in
his
face
you
tried
to
shoot
me
you
tried
to
shoot
me
he
gasped
twice
over
through
a
livid
mask
no
i
did
i
panted
i
tried
to
frighten
you
and
i
jolly
well
succeeded
but
i
shoot
you
like
a
dog
if
you
do
get
back
to
your
kennel
and
lie
down
he
sat
and
gasped
upon
the
side
of
the
bunk
there
was
no
more
fight
in
him
his
very
lips
were
blue
i
put
the
pistol
back
in
my
pocket
and
retracted
my
threat
in
a
sudden
panic
there
it
your
own
fault
if
you
so
much
as
see
it
again
i
promised
him
in
a
breathless
disorder
only
second
to
his
own
but
you
jolly
nearly
strangled
me
and
now
we
a
pretty
pair
his
hands
grasped
the
edge
of
the
bunk
and
he
leant
his
weight
on
them
breathing
very
hard
it
might
have
been
an
attack
of
asthma
or
it
might
have
been
a
more
serious
seizure
but
it
was
a
case
for
stimulants
if
ever
i
saw
one
and
in
the
nick
of
time
i
remembered
the
flask
that
raffles
had
left
with
me
it
was
the
work
of
a
very
few
seconds
to
pour
out
a
goodly
ration
and
of
but
another
for
daniel
levy
to
toss
off
the
raw
spirit
like
water
he
was
begging
for
more
before
i
had
helped
myself
and
more
i
gave
him
in
the
end
for
it
was
no
small
relief
to
me
to
watch
the
leaden
hue
disappearing
from
the
flabby
face
and
the
laboured
breathing
gradually
subside
even
if
it
meant
a
renewal
of
our
desperate
hostilities
but
all
that
was
at
an
end
the
man
was
shaken
to
the
core
by
his
perfectly
legitimate
attempt
at
my
destruction
he
looked
dreadfully
old
and
hideous
as
he
got
bodily
back
into
the
bunk
of
his
own
accord
there
when
i
had
yielded
to
his
further
importunities
and
the
flask
was
empty
he
fell
at
length
into
a
sleep
as
genuine
as
the
last
was
not
and
i
was
still
watching
over
the
poor
devil
keeping
the
flies
off
him
and
sometimes
fanning
him
with
a
flag
less
perhaps
from
humane
motives
than
to
keep
him
quiet
as
long
as
possible
when
raffles
returned
to
light
up
the
tableau
like
a
sinister
sunbeam
raffles
had
had
his
own
adventures
in
town
and
i
soon
had
reason
to
feel
thankful
that
i
had
not
gone
up
instead
of
him
it
seemed
he
had
foreseen
from
the
first
the
possibility
of
trouble
at
the
bank
over
a
large
and
absolutely
open
cheque
so
he
had
gone
first
to
the
chelsea
studio
in
which
he
played
the
painter
who
never
painted
but
kept
a
whole
wardrobe
of
disguises
for
the
models
he
never
hired
thence
he
had
issued
on
this
occasion
in
the
living
image
of
a
military
man
about
town
who
was
also
well
known
to
be
a
client
of
dan
levy
raffles
said
the
cashier
stared
at
him
but
the
cheque
was
cashed
without
a
word
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
was
that
in
returning
to
his
cab
he
had
encountered
an
acquaintance
both
of
his
own
and
of
the
spendthrift
soldier
and
had
been
greeted
evidently
in
the
latter
capacity
it
was
a
jolly
difficult
little
moment
bunny
i
had
to
say
there
was
some
mistake
and
i
had
to
remember
to
say
it
in
a
manner
equally
unlike
my
own
and
the
other
beggar
but
all
well
that
ends
well
and
if
you
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
i
think
we
may
flatter
ourselves
that
a
happy
issue
is
at
last
in
sight
what
am
i
to
do
now
i
asked
with
some
misgiving
clear
out
of
this
bunny
and
wait
for
me
in
town
you
done
jolly
well
old
fellow
and
so
have
i
in
my
own
department
of
the
game
everything
in
order
down
to
those
fifteen
hundred
guineas
which
are
now
concealed
about
my
person
in
as
hard
cash
as
i
can
carry
i
seen
old
garland
and
given
him
back
his
promissory
note
myself
with
undertaking
about
the
mortgage
it
was
a
pretty
trying
interview
as
you
can
understand
but
i
could
help
wondering
what
the
poor
old
boy
would
say
if
he
dreamt
what
sort
of
pressure
i
been
applying
on
his
behalf
well
it
all
over
now
except
our
several
exits
from
the
surreptitious
stage
i
ca
make
mine
without
our
sleeping
partner
but
you
would
really
simplify
matters
bunny
by
not
waiting
for
us
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
such
a
course
though
it
went
not
a
little
against
my
grain
raffles
had
changed
his
clothes
and
had
a
bath
in
town
to
say
nothing
of
his
luncheon
i
was
by
this
time
indescribably
dirty
and
dishevelled
besides
feeling
fairly
famished
now
that
mental
relief
allowed
a
thought
for
one
lower
man
raffles
had
foreseen
my
plight
and
had
actually
prepared
a
way
of
escape
for
me
by
the
front
door
in
broad
daylight
i
need
not
recapitulate
the
elaborate
story
he
had
told
the
caretaking
gardener
across
the
road
but
he
had
borrowed
the
gardener
keys
as
a
probable
purchaser
of
the
property
who
had
to
meet
his
builder
and
a
business
friend
at
the
house
during
the
course
of
the
afternoon
i
was
to
be
the
builder
and
in
that
capacity
to
give
the
gardener
an
ingenious
message
calculated
to
leave
raffles
and
levy
in
uninterrupted
possession
until
my
return
and
of
course
i
was
never
to
return
at
all
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
me
a
means
to
a
far
simpler
end
than
the
one
we
had
achieved
by
stealth
in
the
dead
of
the
previous
night
but
it
was
raffles
all
over
and
i
ultimately
acquiesced
on
the
understanding
that
we
were
to
meet
again
in
the
albany
at
seven
preparatory
to
dining
somewhere
in
final
celebration
of
the
whole
affair
but
much
was
to
happen
before
seven
and
it
began
happening
i
shook
the
dust
of
that
derelict
tower
from
my
feet
for
one
of
them
trod
on
something
at
the
darkest
point
of
the
descent
and
the
thing
went
tinkling
down
ahead
on
its
own
account
until
it
lay
shimmering
in
the
light
on
a
lower
landing
where
i
picked
it
up
now
i
had
not
said
much
to
raffles
about
my
hitherto
inexplicable
experience
with
the
revolver
when
i
thought
it
had
gone
through
the
banisters
but
found
it
afterwards
in
my
hand
raffles
said
it
would
not
have
gone
through
that
i
must
have
been
all
but
over
the
banisters
myself
when
i
grasped
the
butt
as
it
protruded
through
them
on
the
level
of
the
floor
this
he
said
like
many
another
thing
as
though
it
made
an
end
of
the
matter
but
it
was
not
the
end
of
the
matter
in
my
own
mind
and
now
i
could
have
told
him
what
the
explanation
was
or
at
least
to
what
conclusion
i
had
jumped
i
had
half
a
mind
to
climb
all
the
way
up
again
on
purpose
to
put
him
in
the
wrong
upon
the
point
then
i
remembered
how
anxious
he
had
seemed
to
get
rid
of
me
and
for
other
reasons
also
i
decided
to
let
him
wait
a
bit
for
his
surprise
meanwhile
my
own
plans
were
altered
and
when
i
had
delivered
my
egregious
message
to
the
gardener
across
the
road
i
sought
the
nearest
shops
on
my
way
to
the
nearest
station
and
at
one
of
the
shops
i
got
me
a
clean
collar
at
another
a
and
all
i
did
at
the
station
was
to
utilise
my
purchases
in
the
course
of
such
scanty
toilet
as
the
lavatory
accommodation
would
permit
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
inquiring
my
way
to
a
house
which
it
took
me
another
twenty
or
to
find
chapter
xvii
a
secret
service
this
house
also
was
on
the
river
but
it
was
very
small
compared
with
the
other
two
one
of
a
couple
built
close
to
the
road
with
narrow
strips
of
garden
to
the
river
brim
its
dingy
stucco
front
and
its
green
venetian
blinds
conveyed
no
conceivable
attraction
beyond
that
of
a
situation
more
likely
to
prove
a
drawback
three
seasons
out
of
the
four
the
wooden
gate
had
not
swung
home
behind
me
before
i
was
at
the
top
of
a
somewhat
dirty
flight
of
steps
contemplating
blistered
paint
and
ground
glass
fit
for
a
bathroom
window
and
listening
to
the
last
reverberations
of
an
obsolete
type
of
bell
there
was
indeed
something
oppressively
and
yet
prettily
victorian
about
the
riparian
retreat
to
which
lady
laura
belsize
had
retired
in
her
impoverished
widowhood
it
was
not
for
lady
laura
that
i
asked
however
but
for
miss
belsize
and
the
almost
slatternly
maid
really
could
say
whether
miss
belsize
was
in
or
whether
she
was
she
might
be
in
the
garden
or
she
might
be
on
the
river
would
i
step
inside
and
wait
a
minute
i
would
and
did
but
it
was
more
minutes
than
one
that
i
was
kept
languishing
in
an
interior
as
dingy
as
the
outside
of
the
house
i
had
time
to
take
the
whole
thing
in
there
were
massive
remnants
of
deservedly
unfashionable
furniture
the
sofa
i
can
still
see
in
my
mind
eye
and
the
steel
and
the
crystal
chandelier
an
aged
and
gigantic
broadwood
occupied
nearly
half
the
room
and
in
a
cheap
frame
thereon
inviting
all
sorts
of
comparisons
and
contrasts
stood
a
portrait
of
camilla
belsize
resplendent
in
contemporary
court
kit
i
was
still
studying
that
frankly
barbaric
paraphernalia
the
feather
the
necklace
the
coiled
train
and
wondering
what
noble
kinsman
had
come
to
the
rescue
for
the
great
occasion
and
why
camilla
should
have
looked
so
bored
with
her
finery
when
the
door
opened
and
she
herself
entered
not
even
very
smartly
dressed
and
looking
anything
but
bored
although
i
say
it
but
she
did
seem
astonished
anxious
indignant
reproachful
and
to
my
mind
still
more
nervous
and
distressed
though
this
hardly
showed
through
the
loopholes
of
her
pride
and
as
for
her
white
serge
coat
and
skirt
they
looked
as
though
they
had
seen
considerable
service
on
the
river
and
i
immediately
perceived
that
one
of
the
large
enamel
buttons
was
missing
from
the
coat
up
to
that
moment
i
may
now
confess
i
had
been
suffering
from
no
slight
nervous
anxiety
of
my
own
but
all
qualms
were
lost
in
sheer
excitement
when
i
spoke
you
may
well
wonder
at
this
intrusion
i
began
but
i
thought
this
must
be
yours
miss
belsize
and
from
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
produced
the
missing
button
of
enamel
where
did
you
find
it
inquired
miss
belsize
with
an
admirably
slight
increase
of
astonishment
in
voice
and
look
and
how
did
you
know
it
was
mine
came
quickly
in
the
next
breath
i
did
know
i
answered
i
guessed
it
was
the
shot
of
my
life
but
you
do
say
where
you
found
it
in
an
empty
house
not
far
from
here
she
had
held
her
breath
now
i
felt
it
like
the
lightest
zephyr
and
quite
unconsciously
i
had
retained
the
enamel
button
well
manders
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
may
i
have
it
back
again
i
returned
her
property
we
had
been
staring
at
each
other
all
the
time
i
stared
still
harder
as
she
repeated
her
perfunctory
thanks
so
it
was
you
i
said
and
was
sorry
to
see
her
looking
purposely
puzzled
at
that
but
thankful
when
the
reckless
light
outshone
all
the
rest
in
those
chameleon
eyes
of
hers
who
did
you
think
it
was
she
asked
me
with
a
frosty
little
smile
i
did
know
if
it
was
anybody
at
all
i
did
know
what
to
think
said
i
quite
candidly
i
simply
found
his
pistol
in
my
hand
whose
pistol
dan
levy
good
she
said
grimly
that
makes
it
all
the
better
you
saved
my
life
i
thought
you
had
taken
his
and
i
collaborated
there
was
not
a
tremor
in
her
voice
it
was
cautious
eager
daring
intense
but
absolutely
her
own
voice
now
no
i
said
i
did
shoot
the
fellow
but
i
made
him
think
i
had
you
made
me
think
so
too
until
i
heard
what
you
said
to
him
yet
you
never
made
a
sound
yourself
i
should
think
not
i
made
myself
scarce
instead
but
miss
belsize
i
shall
go
perfectly
mad
if
you
do
tell
me
how
you
happened
to
be
there
at
all
do
you
think
it
for
you
to
tell
me
that
about
yourself
and
all
of
you
oh
i
do
mind
which
of
us
fires
first
said
i
excitedly
then
i
will
she
said
at
once
and
took
me
to
the
dreadful
sofa
at
the
inner
end
of
the
room
and
sat
down
as
though
it
were
the
most
ordinary
experience
she
had
to
relate
nor
could
i
believe
the
things
that
had
really
happened
and
all
so
recently
as
we
talked
them
over
in
that
commonplace
environment
of
faded
gentility
there
was
a
window
behind
us
overlooking
the
ribbon
of
lawn
and
the
cord
of
gravel
and
the
bunch
of
willows
that
hedged
them
from
the
thames
it
all
looked
unreal
to
me
unreal
in
its
very
realism
as
the
scene
of
our
incredible
conversation
you
know
what
happened
the
other
afternoon
i
mean
the
day
they
could
play
began
miss
belsize
because
you
were
there
and
though
you
did
stay
to
hear
all
that
came
out
afterwards
i
expect
you
know
everything
now
raffles
would
be
sure
to
tell
you
in
fact
i
heard
poor
dear
garland
give
him
leave
it
a
dreadful
story
from
every
point
of
view
nobody
comes
out
of
it
with
flying
colours
but
what
nice
person
could
cope
with
a
horrid
raffles
perhaps
if
you
call
him
nice
i
said
that
was
about
the
worst
thing
i
called
him
i
mentioned
some
of
the
other
things
miss
belsize
listened
to
them
with
exemplary
patience
well
she
resumed
he
was
quite
nice
about
this
i
will
say
that
for
him
he
said
he
knew
levy
pretty
well
and
would
see
what
could
be
done
but
he
spoke
like
an
executioner
who
was
going
to
see
what
could
be
done
with
the
condemned
man
and
all
the
time
i
was
wondering
what
had
been
done
already
at
carlsbad
what
exactly
that
horrid
creature
meant
when
he
was
talking
raffles
before
us
all
well
of
course
i
knew
what
he
meant
us
to
think
he
meant
but
was
there
could
there
be
anything
in
it
miss
belsize
looked
at
me
as
though
she
expected
an
answer
only
to
stop
me
the
moment
i
opened
my
mouth
to
speak
i
do
want
to
know
manders
of
course
you
know
all
about
raffles
there
was
a
touch
of
feeling
in
this
but
it
nothing
to
me
though
in
this
case
i
should
certainly
have
been
on
his
side
you
said
yourself
that
it
could
only
have
been
a
practical
joke
if
there
was
anything
in
it
at
all
and
so
i
tried
to
think
in
spite
of
those
horrid
men
who
were
following
him
about
at
lord
even
in
spite
of
the
way
he
vanished
with
them
after
him
but
he
never
came
near
the
match
again
though
he
had
travelled
all
the
way
from
carlsbad
to
see
it
why
had
he
ever
been
there
what
had
he
really
done
there
and
what
could
he
possibly
do
to
rescue
anybody
from
levy
if
he
himself
was
already
in
levy
power
you
do
know
raffles
said
i
promptly
enough
this
time
he
never
was
in
any
man
power
for
many
minutes
i
would
back
him
to
save
the
most
desperate
situation
you
could
devise
you
mean
by
some
desperate
deed
that
what
i
feared
declared
miss
belsize
rather
strenuously
something
really
had
happened
at
carlsbad
something
worse
was
by
way
of
happening
next
for
teddy
sake
she
whispered
and
his
poor
father
i
agreed
that
old
raffles
stuck
at
nothing
for
his
friends
and
miss
belsize
again
said
that
was
what
she
had
feared
her
tone
had
completely
altered
about
raffles
as
well
it
might
i
thought
it
would
have
broken
with
gratitude
when
she
spoke
of
the
unlucky
father
and
son
and
i
was
right
she
exclaimed
with
that
other
kind
of
feeling
to
which
i
found
it
harder
to
put
a
name
i
came
home
miserable
from
the
match
on
saturday
though
teddy
had
done
so
well
i
was
fool
enough
to
interject
i
could
help
thinking
about
raffles
replied
camilla
with
a
flash
of
her
frank
eyes
and
wondering
and
wondering
what
had
happened
and
then
on
sunday
i
saw
him
on
the
river
he
did
tell
me
he
did
know
i
recognised
him
he
was
disguised
absolutely
said
camilla
belsize
under
her
breath
but
he
could
disguise
himself
from
me
she
added
as
though
glorying
in
her
perspicacity
did
you
tell
him
so
miss
belsize
not
i
indeed
i
did
speak
to
him
it
was
no
business
of
mine
but
there
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
levy
garden
having
a
good
look
at
the
boathouse
when
nobody
was
about
why
what
could
his
object
be
and
why
disguise
himself
i
thought
of
the
affair
at
carlsbad
and
i
felt
certain
that
something
of
the
kind
was
going
to
happen
again
well
what
could
i
do
should
i
do
anything
at
all
was
it
any
business
of
mine
you
may
imagine
the
way
i
myself
and
you
may
imagine
the
crooked
answers
i
got
i
wo
bore
you
with
the
psychology
of
the
thing
it
pretty
obvious
after
all
it
was
not
so
much
a
case
of
doing
the
best
as
of
knowing
the
worst
all
day
yesterday
there
were
no
developments
of
any
sort
and
there
was
no
sign
of
raffles
nothing
had
happened
in
the
night
or
we
should
have
heard
of
it
but
that
made
me
all
the
more
certain
that
something
or
other
would
happen
last
night
the
week
grace
was
nearly
up
you
know
what
i
mean
their
last
week
at
their
own
house
if
anything
was
to
be
done
it
was
about
time
and
i
knew
raffles
was
going
to
do
something
i
wanted
to
know
what
that
was
all
quite
right
too
i
murmured
but
i
doubt
if
miss
belsize
heard
me
she
was
in
no
need
of
my
encouragement
or
my
approval
the
old
light
her
own
light
the
reckless
light
was
burning
away
in
her
brilliant
eyes
the
night
before
she
went
on
i
hardly
slept
a
wink
last
night
i
preferred
not
to
go
to
bed
at
all
i
told
you
i
sometimes
did
weird
things
that
astonished
the
natives
of
these
suburban
shores
well
last
night
if
it
was
early
this
morning
i
made
my
weirdest
effort
yet
i
have
a
canoe
you
know
just
now
i
almost
live
in
it
last
night
i
went
out
unbeknowns
after
midnight
partly
to
reassure
myself
partly
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
manders
i
did
speak
your
face
shouted
i
rather
you
went
on
but
if
you
know
what
i
going
to
say
of
course
i
knew
but
i
dragged
it
from
her
none
the
less
the
nebulous
figure
in
the
canoe
that
had
skimmed
past
dan
frontage
as
we
were
trying
to
get
him
aboard
his
own
and
again
past
the
empty
house
when
we
were
in
the
act
of
disembarking
him
there
that
figure
was
the
trim
and
slim
one
now
at
my
side
she
had
seen
us
searched
for
us
each
time
our
voices
she
had
heard
and
recognised
only
our
actions
or
rather
that
midnight
deed
of
ours
had
she
misinterpreted
she
would
not
admit
it
to
me
but
i
still
believe
she
feared
it
was
a
dead
body
that
we
had
shipped
at
dead
of
night
to
hide
away
in
that
desolate
tower
yet
i
can
not
think
she
thought
it
in
her
heart
i
rather
fancy
what
she
indeed
averred
that
some
vague
inkling
of
the
truth
flashed
across
her
at
least
as
often
as
that
monstrous
hypothesis
but
know
she
must
therefore
after
boldly
ascertaining
that
nothing
was
known
of
the
master
whereabouts
at
levy
house
but
that
no
uneasiness
was
entertained
on
his
account
this
young
woman
true
to
the
audacity
which
i
had
seen
in
her
eyes
from
the
first
had
taken
the
still
bolder
step
of
landing
on
the
rank
lawn
and
entering
the
empty
tower
to
discover
its
secret
for
herself
her
stealthy
step
upon
the
spiral
stair
had
been
the
signal
for
my
mortal
struggle
with
dan
levy
she
had
heard
the
whole
and
even
seen
a
little
of
that
in
fact
she
had
gathered
enough
from
horrible
imprecations
to
form
later
a
rough
but
not
incorrect
impression
of
the
situation
between
him
and
raffles
and
me
as
for
the
language
it
was
with
a
welcome
gleam
of
humour
that
miss
belsize
assured
me
she
had
gone
too
straight
to
hounds
in
her
time
to
be
as
completely
paralysed
by
it
as
her
mother
neighbours
might
have
been
and
as
for
the
revolver
it
had
fallen
at
her
feet
and
first
she
thought
i
was
going
to
follow
it
over
the
banisters
and
before
she
could
think
again
she
had
restored
the
weapon
to
my
wildly
clutching
hand
but
when
you
fired
i
felt
a
murderess
she
said
so
you
see
i
misjudged
you
for
the
second
time
if
i
am
conveying
a
dash
of
flippancy
in
our
talk
let
me
earnestly
declare
that
it
was
hardly
even
a
dash
it
was
but
a
wry
and
rueful
humour
on
the
girl
part
and
that
only
towards
the
end
but
i
can
promise
my
worst
critic
that
i
was
never
less
facetious
in
my
life
i
was
thinking
in
my
heavy
way
that
i
had
never
looked
into
such
eyes
as
these
so
bold
so
sad
so
merry
with
it
all
i
was
thinking
that
i
had
never
listened
to
such
a
voice
or
come
across
recklessness
and
sentiment
so
harmonised
save
also
in
her
eyes
i
was
thinking
that
there
never
was
a
girl
to
touch
camilla
belsize
or
a
man
either
except
raffles
and
yet
and
yet
it
was
over
raffles
that
she
took
all
the
wind
from
my
sails
exactly
as
she
had
done
at
lord
only
now
she
did
it
at
parting
and
sent
me
off
into
the
dusk
a
slightly
puzzled
and
exceedingly
exasperated
man
of
course
said
camilla
at
her
garden
gate
of
course
you
wo
repeat
a
word
of
what
i
told
you
mr
manders
you
mean
about
your
adventures
last
night
and
said
i
somewhat
taken
aback
i
mean
every
single
thing
we
talked
about
was
her
sweeping
reply
not
a
syllable
must
go
an
inch
further
otherwise
i
shall
be
very
sorry
i
ever
spoke
to
you
as
though
she
had
come
and
confided
in
me
of
her
own
accord
but
i
passed
that
even
if
i
noticed
it
at
the
time
i
wo
tell
a
soul
of
course
i
said
and
fidgeted
that
is
except
i
suppose
you
do
mind
i
do
there
must
be
no
exceptions
not
even
old
raffles
raffles
least
of
all
cried
camilla
belsize
with
almost
a
forked
flash
from
those
masterful
eyes
raffles
is
the
last
person
in
the
world
who
must
ever
know
a
single
thing
not
even
that
it
was
you
who
absolutely
saved
the
situation
for
him
and
me
i
asked
wistfully
for
i
much
wanted
these
two
to
think
better
of
each
other
and
it
had
begun
to
look
as
though
i
had
my
wish
so
far
as
camilla
was
concerned
while
i
had
only
to
tell
raffles
everything
to
make
him
her
slave
for
life
but
now
she
was
adamant
on
the
point
adamant
heated
in
some
hidden
flame
it
rather
hard
lines
on
me
manders
if
because
i
go
and
get
excited
and
twist
off
a
button
in
my
excitement
as
i
suppose
i
must
have
done
unless
it
a
judgment
on
me
it
rather
hard
lines
if
you
give
me
away
when
i
never
should
have
given
myself
away
to
you
this
was
unkind
it
was
still
more
unfair
in
view
of
the
former
passage
between
us
to
the
same
tune
i
was
evidently
getting
no
credit
for
my
very
irksome
fidelity
i
helped
myself
to
some
at
once
you
gave
yourself
away
to
me
at
lord
all
right
said
i
cheerfully
and
i
never
let
out
a
word
of
that
not
even
to
mr
raffles
she
asked
with
a
quick
unguarded
intonation
that
was
almost
wistful
not
a
word
was
my
reply
raffles
has
no
idea
you
noticed
anything
much
less
how
keen
you
were
for
me
to
warn
him
miss
belsize
looked
at
me
a
moment
with
civil
war
in
her
splendid
eyes
then
something
won
i
think
it
was
only
her
pride
and
she
was
holding
out
her
hand
he
must
never
know
a
word
of
this
either
said
she
firmly
as
at
first
and
i
hope
you
forgive
me
for
not
trusting
you
quite
as
i
always
shall
for
the
future
i
forgive
you
everything
miss
belsize
except
your
dislike
of
dear
old
raffles
i
had
spoken
quite
earnestly
keeping
her
hand
she
drew
it
away
as
i
made
my
point
i
do
dislike
him
she
answered
in
a
strange
tone
but
with
a
stranger
stress
she
added
i
do
him
either
and
even
then
i
could
not
see
what
the
verb
should
have
been
or
why
miss
belsize
should
turn
away
so
quickly
in
the
end
and
snatch
her
eyes
away
quicker
still
i
saw
them
and
thought
of
her
all
the
way
back
to
the
station
but
not
an
inch
further
so
i
need
no
sympathy
on
that
score
if
i
did
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
that
july
evening
for
i
saw
somebody
else
and
had
something
else
to
think
about
from
the
moment
i
set
foot
upon
the
platform
it
was
the
wrong
platform
i
was
about
to
cross
by
the
bridge
when
a
down
train
came
rattling
in
and
out
jumped
a
man
i
knew
by
sight
before
it
stopped
the
man
was
mackenzie
the
incorrigibly
scotch
detective
whom
we
had
met
at
milchester
abbey
who
i
always
thought
had
kept
an
eye
on
raffles
ever
since
he
was
across
the
platform
before
the
train
pulled
up
and
i
did
what
raffles
would
have
done
in
my
place
i
ran
after
him
ye
ken
dan
levy
hoose
by
the
river
i
heard
him
babble
to
his
cabman
with
wilful
breadth
of
speech
then
drive
there
mon
like
the
deevil
himsel
chapter
xviii
the
death
of
a
sinner
what
was
i
to
do
i
knew
what
raffles
would
have
done
he
would
have
outstripped
mackenzie
in
his
descent
upon
the
moneylender
beaten
the
cab
on
foot
most
probably
and
dared
dan
levy
to
denounce
him
to
the
detective
i
could
see
a
delicious
situation
and
raffles
conducting
it
inimitably
to
a
triumphant
issue
but
i
was
not
raffles
and
what
was
more
i
was
due
already
at
his
chambers
in
the
albany
i
must
have
been
talking
to
miss
belsize
by
the
hour
together
to
my
horror
i
found
it
close
upon
seven
by
the
station
clock
and
it
was
some
minutes
past
when
i
plunged
into
the
first
up
train
waterloo
was
reached
before
eight
but
i
was
a
good
hour
late
at
the
albany
and
raffles
let
me
know
it
in
his
from
the
window
i
thought
you
were
dead
bunny
he
muttered
down
as
though
he
wished
i
were
i
scaled
his
staircase
at
two
or
three
bounds
and
began
all
about
mackenzie
in
the
lobby
so
soon
says
raffles
with
a
mere
lift
of
the
eyebrows
well
thank
god
i
was
ready
for
him
again
i
now
saw
that
raffles
was
not
dressing
though
he
had
changed
his
clothes
and
this
surprised
me
for
all
my
breathless
preoccupation
but
i
had
the
reason
at
a
glance
through
the
into
his
bedroom
the
bed
was
cumbered
with
clothes
and
an
open
a
gladstone
bag
stood
strapped
and
bulging
a
travelling
rug
lay
ready
for
rolling
up
and
raffles
himself
looked
out
of
training
in
his
travelling
tweeds
going
away
i
ejaculated
rather
said
he
folding
a
smoking
jacket
is
it
about
time
after
what
you
told
me
but
you
were
packing
before
you
knew
then
for
god
sake
go
and
do
the
same
yourself
he
cried
and
ask
questions
now
i
was
beginning
to
pack
enough
for
us
both
but
have
time
to
shove
in
a
shirt
and
collar
of
your
own
if
you
jump
straight
into
a
hansom
i
take
the
tickets
and
we
meet
on
the
platform
at
five
to
nine
what
platform
raffles
charing
cross
continental
train
but
where
the
deuce
do
you
think
of
going
australia
if
you
like
we
discuss
it
in
our
flight
across
europe
our
flight
i
repeated
what
has
happened
since
i
left
you
raffles
look
here
bunny
you
go
and
pack
was
all
my
answer
from
a
savage
face
as
i
was
fairly
driven
to
the
door
do
you
realise
that
you
were
due
here
one
golden
hour
ago
and
have
i
asked
what
happened
to
you
then
do
you
ask
rotten
questions
that
there
no
time
to
answer
i
tell
you
everything
in
the
train
bunny
and
my
name
at
the
end
in
a
different
voice
and
his
hand
for
an
instant
on
my
shoulder
as
i
passed
out
were
my
only
consolation
for
his
truly
terrifying
behaviour
my
only
comfort
and
reassurance
of
any
kind
until
we
really
were
off
by
the
night
mail
from
charing
cross
raffles
was
himself
again
by
that
time
i
was
thankful
to
find
nor
did
he
betray
that
dread
or
expectation
of
pursuit
which
would
have
tallied
with
his
previous
manner
he
merely
looked
relieved
when
the
embankment
lights
ran
right
and
left
in
our
wake
i
remember
one
of
his
remarks
that
they
made
the
finest
necklace
in
the
world
when
all
was
said
and
another
that
big
ben
was
the
of
the
london
lights
but
he
had
also
a
quizzical
eye
upon
the
paper
bag
from
which
i
was
endeavouring
to
make
a
meal
at
last
and
more
than
once
he
wagged
his
head
with
a
humorous
admixture
of
reproof
and
sympathy
for
with
shamefaced
admissions
and
downcast
pauses
i
was
allowing
him
to
suppose
i
had
been
drinking
at
some
riverside
instead
of
hurrying
up
to
town
but
that
the
with
mackenzie
had
served
to
sober
me
poor
bunny
we
wo
pursue
the
matter
any
further
but
i
do
know
where
we
both
should
have
been
between
seven
and
eight
it
was
as
nice
a
little
dinner
as
i
ever
ordered
in
my
life
and
to
think
that
we
never
turned
up
to
eat
a
bite
of
it
did
i
queried
and
my
sense
of
guilt
deepened
to
remorse
as
raffles
shook
his
head
no
fear
bunny
i
wanted
to
see
you
safe
and
sound
that
was
what
made
me
so
stuffy
when
you
did
turn
up
loud
were
my
lamentations
and
earnest
my
entreaties
to
raffles
to
share
the
contents
of
my
paper
bag
but
not
he
to
replace
such
a
feast
as
he
had
ordered
with
sandwiches
and
eggs
would
be
worse
than
going
healthily
hungry
for
once
it
was
all
very
well
for
me
who
knew
not
what
i
had
missed
not
that
raffles
was
hungry
by
his
own
accounts
he
had
merely
fancied
a
little
dinner
more
after
my
heart
than
his
for
our
last
on
british
soil
this
and
the
way
he
said
it
brought
me
back
to
the
heart
of
things
for
beneath
his
frothy
phrases
i
felt
that
the
wine
of
life
was
bitter
to
his
taste
his
gayety
now
afforded
no
truer
criterion
to
his
real
feelings
than
had
his
petulance
at
the
albany
what
had
happened
since
our
parting
in
that
fatal
tower
to
make
this
wild
flight
necessary
without
my
news
and
whither
in
all
earnest
were
we
to
fly
oh
nothing
said
raffles
in
unsatisfactory
answer
to
my
first
question
i
thought
you
would
have
seen
that
we
could
clear
out
too
soon
after
restoring
poor
shylock
like
our
brethren
in
the
song
his
friends
and
his
relations
but
i
thought
you
had
something
else
for
him
to
sign
so
i
had
bunny
what
was
that
a
plain
statement
of
all
he
had
suborned
me
to
do
for
him
and
what
he
had
given
me
for
doing
it
said
raffles
as
he
lit
a
sullivan
from
his
last
easeful
one
might
almost
call
it
a
receipt
for
the
letter
i
stole
and
he
destroyed
and
did
he
sign
that
i
insisted
on
it
for
our
protection
then
we
are
protected
and
yet
we
cut
and
run
raffles
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
we
hurtled
between
the
lighted
platforms
of
herne
hill
there
no
immunity
from
a
clever
cove
like
that
bunny
unless
you
send
him
to
another
world
or
put
the
thick
of
this
one
between
you
he
may
hold
his
tongue
about
the
last
hours
i
believe
he
will
but
that
need
prevent
him
from
setting
old
mackenzie
to
watch
us
day
and
night
so
we
are
not
going
to
stay
to
be
watched
we
are
starting
off
round
the
world
for
a
change
before
we
get
very
far
shylock
may
be
in
the
jug
himself
that
accursed
letter
wo
be
the
only
incriminating
thing
against
him
you
take
my
word
then
we
can
come
back
trailing
clouds
of
glory
and
blowing
clouds
of
sullivan
then
we
can
have
our
meaning
second
knocks
bunny
and
more
power
to
our
elbows
when
we
get
them
but
i
was
not
convinced
there
was
something
else
at
the
bottom
of
this
sudden
impulse
and
its
inconceivably
sudden
execution
why
had
he
never
told
me
of
this
plan
well
because
it
had
never
become
one
until
after
the
morning
work
at
levy
bank
in
itself
a
reason
for
being
out
of
the
way
as
i
myself
admitted
but
he
would
have
told
me
if
only
i
had
turned
up
at
seven
he
had
never
meant
to
give
me
time
for
much
packing
added
raffles
as
he
was
anxious
that
neither
of
us
should
leave
the
impression
that
we
had
gone
far
afield
i
thought
this
was
childish
and
treating
me
like
a
child
to
which
however
i
was
used
but
more
than
ever
did
i
feel
that
raffles
was
not
being
frank
with
me
that
he
for
one
was
making
good
his
escape
from
something
or
somebody
besides
dan
levy
and
in
the
end
he
admitted
that
this
was
so
but
we
had
not
dashed
through
and
faversham
before
i
wormed
my
way
to
about
the
last
discovery
that
i
expected
to
make
concerning
raffles
what
an
inquisitor
you
are
bunny
said
he
putting
down
an
evening
paper
that
he
had
only
just
taken
up
ca
you
see
that
this
whole
show
has
been
no
ordinary
one
for
me
i
been
fighting
for
a
crowd
i
rather
love
their
battle
has
got
on
my
nerves
as
none
of
my
own
ever
did
and
now
it
won
i
honestly
funk
their
gratitude
as
much
as
anything
that
was
another
hard
saying
to
swallow
and
yet
as
raffles
said
it
i
knew
it
to
be
true
he
was
looking
me
full
in
the
face
in
the
ample
light
of
the
compartment
which
we
of
course
had
to
ourselves
some
softening
influence
seemed
to
have
been
at
work
upon
him
he
looked
resolute
as
ever
but
full
of
regret
than
which
nothing
was
rarer
in
i
suppose
said
i
that
poor
old
garland
has
treated
you
to
a
pretty
good
dose
already
yes
bunny
that
he
has
and
well
he
may
and
well
may
teddy
and
camilla
belsize
but
i
could
do
with
it
from
them
said
raffles
with
quite
a
bitter
little
laugh
teddy
was
there
of
course
he
up
north
for
that
rotten
match
the
team
play
nowadays
against
liverpool
but
the
fizzling
he
be
home
and
i
simply
ca
face
him
and
his
camilla
he
be
a
married
man
before
we
see
him
again
added
raffles
getting
hold
of
his
evening
paper
once
more
is
that
to
come
off
so
soon
the
sooner
the
better
said
raffles
strangely
you
not
quite
happy
about
it
said
i
with
execrable
tact
i
know
and
yet
deliberately
because
his
view
of
this
marriage
had
always
puzzled
me
i
happy
as
long
as
they
are
responded
raffles
not
without
a
laugh
at
his
own
meritorious
sentiment
i
only
wish
he
sighed
that
they
were
both
absolutely
worthy
of
each
other
and
you
do
think
they
are
no
i
do
you
think
such
a
lot
of
young
garland
i
very
fond
of
him
bunny
but
you
see
his
faults
i
always
seen
them
they
not
like
mine
yet
you
think
she
not
good
enough
for
him
not
good
enough
she
and
he
stopped
himself
at
that
but
his
voice
was
enough
for
me
the
unspoken
antithesis
was
stronger
than
words
could
have
made
it
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
where
on
earth
did
you
get
that
idea
i
thought
it
was
yours
but
why
you
seemed
to
disapprove
of
the
engagement
from
the
first
so
i
did
after
what
poor
teddy
had
been
up
to
in
his
extremity
i
may
as
well
be
honest
about
that
now
it
was
all
right
in
a
pal
of
ours
bunny
but
all
wrong
in
the
man
who
dreamt
of
marrying
camilla
belsize
yet
you
have
just
been
moving
heaven
and
hell
to
make
it
possible
for
them
to
marry
after
all
raffles
made
another
attempt
upon
his
paper
i
marvel
now
that
he
let
me
catechise
him
as
i
was
doing
but
the
truth
had
just
dawned
upon
me
and
i
simply
had
to
see
it
whole
as
the
risen
sun
whereas
raffles
seemed
under
no
such
passionate
necessity
to
keep
it
to
himself
teddy
all
right
said
he
inconsistently
he
never
try
anything
of
the
kind
again
he
had
a
lesson
for
life
besides
i
do
often
take
my
hand
from
the
plough
as
you
ought
to
know
bunny
it
was
i
who
brought
those
two
together
but
it
was
none
of
my
mundane
business
to
put
them
asunder
again
it
was
you
who
brought
them
together
i
repeated
insidiously
more
or
less
bunny
it
was
at
some
cricket
week
if
it
was
two
weeks
running
they
were
pals
already
but
she
and
i
were
greater
pals
before
the
first
week
was
over
and
yet
you
did
cut
him
out
my
dear
bunny
i
should
hope
not
but
you
might
have
done
do
tell
me
you
could
if
you
tried
raffles
played
with
his
paper
without
replying
he
was
no
coxcomb
but
neither
would
he
ape
an
alien
humility
it
would
have
been
the
game
bunny
won
or
lost
teddy
or
no
teddy
and
yet
he
added
with
pensive
candour
we
were
getting
on
like
a
house
on
fire
i
burnt
my
fingers
i
do
mind
telling
you
if
i
had
been
what
i
am
bunny
i
might
have
taken
my
courage
in
all
ten
of
and
it
to
the
touch
to
win
or
lose
it
all
i
wish
you
had
i
whispered
as
he
studied
his
paper
upside
down
why
bunny
what
rot
you
do
talk
he
cried
but
only
with
the
irritation
of
a
displeasure
she
the
only
woman
i
ever
met
i
went
on
unguardedly
who
was
your
mate
at
heart
in
pluck
in
temperament
how
the
devil
do
you
know
cried
raffles
off
his
own
guard
now
and
staring
in
my
guilty
face
but
i
have
never
denied
that
i
could
emulate
his
presence
of
mind
upon
occasion
you
forget
what
a
lot
we
saw
of
each
other
last
thursday
in
the
rain
did
she
talk
about
me
then
a
little
had
she
her
knife
in
me
bunny
well
yes
a
little
raffles
smiled
stoically
it
was
a
smile
of
duty
done
and
odds
well
damned
up
to
the
hilt
bunny
up
to
the
hilt
is
what
you
mean
i
stuck
it
in
for
her
it
easily
done
and
it
needed
doing
for
my
sake
if
not
for
hers
sooner
or
later
i
should
have
choked
her
off
so
the
sooner
the
better
you
play
them
false
you
cut
a
dance
you
let
them
down
over
something
that
does
matter
and
they
never
give
you
a
dog
chance
over
anything
that
does
i
got
her
to
write
and
never
answered
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
cavalier
swine
i
said
i
call
before
i
went
abroad
and
only
wired
to
say
sorry
i
could
i
do
say
it
would
or
could
have
been
all
right
otherwise
but
you
see
it
was
all
right
for
teddy
before
i
got
back
which
was
as
it
was
to
be
she
would
hardly
look
at
me
at
first
last
week
but
bunny
she
was
above
looking
when
that
old
shylock
was
playing
at
giving
me
away
before
them
all
she
looked
at
him
and
she
looked
at
me
and
i
got
one
of
the
looks
she
gave
him
and
another
that
she
never
meant
me
to
see
bottled
in
my
blackguard
heart
forever
raffles
looked
dim
to
me
across
the
narrow
compartment
but
there
was
no
nonsense
in
his
look
or
voice
i
longed
to
tell
him
all
i
knew
all
that
she
had
said
to
me
and
he
had
unwittingly
interpreted
that
she
loved
him
as
now
at
last
i
knew
she
did
but
i
had
given
her
my
word
and
after
all
it
was
a
word
to
keep
for
both
their
sakes
as
well
as
for
its
own
you
were
made
for
each
other
you
two
that
was
all
i
said
and
raffles
only
laughed
all
the
more
reason
to
hook
it
round
the
world
bunny
before
there
a
dog
chance
of
our
meeting
again
he
opened
his
paper
the
proper
way
up
at
last
the
train
rushed
on
with
flying
sparks
and
flying
lights
along
the
line
we
were
getting
nearer
dover
now
my
next
brilliant
remark
was
that
i
could
smell
the
sea
raffles
let
it
pass
he
had
been
talking
of
the
scores
in
the
column
and
i
thought
he
was
studying
them
rather
silently
or
perhaps
he
was
not
studying
them
at
all
but
still
thinking
of
camilla
belsize
and
the
look
from
those
brave
bright
eyes
that
she
had
never
meant
him
to
see
then
suddenly
i
perceived
that
his
forehead
was
glistening
white
and
wet
in
the
lamplight
what
is
it
raffles
what
the
matter
he
reversed
his
paper
with
a
shaky
hand
and
thrust
it
upon
me
without
a
word
merely
pointing
out
four
or
five
lines
of
latest
news
this
was
the
item
that
danced
before
my
eyes
tragic
death
of
famous
moneylender
daniel
levy
the
financier
reported
shot
dead
at
front
gates
of
his
residence
in
thames
valley
at
this
afternoon
by
unknown
man
who
made
good
his
escape
i
looked
up
into
a
ghastly
face
it
was
five
when
i
left
him
bunny
you
left
him
i
could
not
ask
it
but
the
ghastly
face
had
given
me
a
ghastlier
thought
as
well
as
you
are
bunny
so
raffles
completed
my
sentence
do
you
think
i
leave
him
for
dead
at
his
own
gates
of
course
i
denied
the
thought
but
it
had
come
to
haunt
me
none
the
less
for
if
i
had
sailed
so
near
such
a
deed
what
about
raffles
under
equal
provocation
and
what
such
motive
for
the
very
flight
that
we
were
making
with
but
a
moment
preparation
it
all
fitted
in
except
the
face
and
voice
of
raffles
as
they
had
been
while
he
was
speaking
of
camilla
belsize
but
again
the
fatal
act
would
indeed
have
made
him
feel
that
he
had
lost
her
and
loosened
his
tongue
upon
his
loss
as
something
had
done
without
doubt
and
as
for
voice
and
face
there
was
no
longer
in
either
any
lack
of
the
mad
excitement
of
the
hunted
man
but
what
were
you
doing
at
his
gates
i
saw
him
home
it
was
on
my
way
why
not
and
you
say
you
left
him
at
five
i
swear
it
i
looked
at
my
watch
thinking
of
my
train
and
my
watch
is
plumb
right
and
you
heard
no
shot
as
you
went
on
no
i
was
hurrying
i
even
ran
i
must
have
been
seen
running
and
now
i
like
charley
aunt
he
went
on
with
his
sardonic
laugh
and
bound
to
stick
to
it
until
they
catch
me
by
the
leg
now
you
know
what
mackenzie
was
doing
down
there
the
old
hound
may
be
on
my
track
already
there
no
going
back
now
not
for
an
innocent
man
not
for
such
dubious
innocence
as
mine
bunny
remember
all
we
been
up
to
with
poor
old
levy
for
the
last
hours
he
paused
remembering
everything
himself
as
i
could
see
and
the
human
compassion
in
his
face
should
have
been
sufficient
answer
to
my
vile
misgivings
but
there
was
contrition
in
his
look
as
well
and
that
was
a
much
rarer
sign
in
raffles
rarer
still
was
a
glance
of
alarm
almost
akin
to
panic
alike
without
precedent
in
my
experience
of
my
friend
and
beyond
belief
in
my
reading
of
his
character
but
through
all
there
peeped
a
conscious
enjoyment
of
these
new
sensations
a
very
zest
in
the
novelty
of
fear
which
i
knew
to
be
at
once
signally
characteristic
and
yet
compatible
either
with
his
story
or
with
my
own
base
dread
nobody
need
ever
know
about
that
said
i
with
the
certainty
that
nobody
ever
would
know
through
the
one
other
who
knew
already
but
raffles
threw
cold
water
upon
that
poor
little
flicker
of
confidence
and
good
hope
it
bound
to
come
out
bunny
they
start
accounting
for
his
last
hours
on
earth
and
they
stick
ominously
in
the
first
five
minutes
working
backwards
then
i
am
described
as
bolting
from
the
scene
then
identified
with
myself
then
found
to
have
fled
the
country
then
carlsbad
then
our
first
row
with
him
then
yesterday
big
cheque
my
heavy
double
finds
he
was
impersonated
at
the
bank
it
all
comes
out
bit
by
bit
and
if
i
caught
it
means
that
dingy
old
bailey
dock
on
the
capital
charge
then
i
be
with
you
said
i
as
accessory
before
and
after
the
fact
that
one
thing
no
no
bunny
you
must
shake
me
off
and
get
back
to
town
i
push
you
out
as
we
slow
down
through
the
streets
of
dover
and
you
can
put
up
for
the
night
at
the
lord
warden
that
the
sort
of
public
place
for
the
likes
of
us
to
lie
low
in
bunny
do
forget
all
my
rules
when
i
gone
you
not
going
without
me
not
even
if
i
did
it
bunny
no
less
than
ever
then
raffles
leant
across
and
took
my
hand
there
was
a
flash
of
mischief
in
his
eyes
but
a
very
tender
light
as
well
it
makes
me
almost
wish
i
were
what
i
do
believe
you
thought
i
was
said
he
to
see
you
stick
to
me
all
the
same
but
it
about
time
that
we
were
making
the
lights
of
dover
he
added
beating
an
abrupt
retreat
from
sentiment
even
to
the
length
of
getting
up
and
looking
out
as
we
clattered
through
a
country
station
his
head
was
in
again
before
the
platform
was
left
behind
a
pale
face
peering
into
mine
real
panic
flaring
in
those
altered
eyes
like
blue
lights
at
sea
my
god
bunny
cried
raffles
i
believe
dover
as
far
as
i
shall
ever
get
why
what
the
matter
now
a
head
sticking
out
of
the
next
compartment
but
one
mackenzie
yes
i
had
seen
it
in
his
face
after
us
already
god
knows
not
necessarily
they
watch
the
ports
after
a
big
murder
swagger
detectives
from
scotland
yard
raffles
did
not
answer
he
had
something
else
to
do
already
he
was
turning
his
pockets
inside
out
a
false
beard
rolled
off
the
seat
that
for
you
he
said
as
i
picked
it
up
i
finish
making
you
up
he
was
busy
on
himself
in
one
of
the
oblong
mirrors
kneeling
on
the
cushions
to
be
near
his
work
if
it
a
scent
at
all
it
must
be
a
pretty
hot
one
bunny
to
have
landed
him
in
the
very
train
and
coach
but
it
may
be
as
bad
as
it
looked
at
first
sight
he
ca
have
much
to
go
upon
yet
if
he
only
going
to
shadow
us
while
they
find
out
more
at
home
we
shall
give
him
the
slip
all
right
do
you
think
he
saw
you
looking
out
no
thank
goodness
he
was
looking
toward
dover
too
but
before
we
started
no
bunny
i
do
believe
he
came
aboard
before
cannon
street
i
remember
hearing
a
bit
of
a
fuss
there
but
our
blinds
were
down
thank
god
they
were
all
down
now
but
by
our
decreasing
speed
i
felt
that
we
were
already
gliding
over
level
crossings
to
the
admiration
of
belated
townsfolk
waiting
at
the
gates
raffles
turned
from
his
mirror
and
i
from
mine
simultaneously
and
even
to
my
initiated
eye
it
was
not
raffles
at
all
but
another
noble
scamp
who
even
in
those
days
before
the
war
was
the
observed
of
all
observers
about
town
it
ever
so
much
better
than
anonymous
disguises
said
raffles
as
he
went
to
work
upon
me
with
his
pocket
box
and
his
lightning
touch
i
was
always
rather
like
him
and
i
tried
him
on
yesterday
with
such
success
at
the
bank
that
i
certainly
ca
do
better
as
for
you
bunny
if
you
slouch
your
hat
and
stick
your
beard
in
your
bread
basket
you
ought
to
pass
for
a
poor
relation
or
a
disreputable
dun
but
here
we
are
my
lad
and
now
for
meester
mackenzie
o
scoteland
yarrd
the
gaunt
detective
was
in
fact
the
first
person
we
beheld
upon
the
pier
platform
and
more
than
he
must
nevertheless
have
jumped
out
once
again
before
the
train
stopped
and
that
almost
on
top
of
a
diminutive
telegraph
boy
who
was
waiting
while
the
old
hound
read
his
telegram
with
one
eye
and
watched
emerging
passengers
with
both
whether
we
should
have
passed
him
unobserved
i
can
not
say
we
could
but
have
tried
but
raffles
preferred
to
grasp
the
nettle
and
salute
mackenzie
with
a
pleasant
nod
good
evening
my
lord
says
the
scotchman
with
a
canny
smirk
i
can
guess
why
you
down
here
says
raffles
actually
producing
a
palpable
sullivan
under
the
nose
of
the
law
is
that
a
fact
inquires
the
other
oiling
the
rebuff
with
deferential
grin
and
i
must
stand
between
you
and
poor
dan
levy
murderer
adds
my
lord
nodding
finally
when
mackenzie
steps
after
him
to
my
horror
but
it
is
only
to
show
raffles
his
telegram
and
he
does
not
follow
us
on
board
neither
did
our
disguises
accompany
our
countenances
across
the
channel
it
was
at
dead
of
night
on
the
upper
deck
whence
all
but
us
had
fled
that
raffles
showed
me
how
to
doff
my
beard
and
still
look
as
though
i
had
merely
buttoned
it
inside
my
overcoat
meanwhile
his
own
moustachios
and
imperial
were
disappearing
by
discreet
degrees
and
at
last
he
told
me
why
though
not
by
any
means
without
pressing
i
only
afraid
you
want
to
turn
straight
back
from
calais
bunny
oh
no
i
sha
you
come
with
me
round
the
world
so
to
speak
to
its
uttermost
ends
a
you
do
know
now
who
it
really
is
that
i
do
want
to
see
again
just
yet
yes
i
know
now
tell
me
what
mackenzie
told
you
it
was
all
in
the
wire
he
showed
me
said
raffles
the
wire
was
to
say
that
the
murderer
of
dan
levy
had
given
himself
up
to
the
police
profane
expletives
flew
from
my
lips
those
of
much
holier
men
might
have
been
no
less
unguardedly
emphatic
in
the
circumstances
but
who
was
it
i
could
have
told
you
all
along
if
you
had
suspected
me
it
was
a
suspicion
raffles
it
was
never
more
than
a
dread
and
i
did
even
dread
it
in
my
heart
of
hearts
do
tell
me
now
raffles
watched
the
red
end
of
a
ruined
sullivan
make
a
fine
trajectory
as
it
flew
to
leeward
between
sea
and
stars
it
was
that
poor
unlucky
little
alien
who
was
waiting
for
him
the
other
morning
in
jermyn
street
and
again
last
night
near
his
own
garden
gate
that
where
he
got
him
in
the
end
but
it
was
a
shooting
case
at
all
bunny
that
why
i
never
heard
anything
it
was
a
case
of
stabbing
in
accordance
with
the
best
traditions
of
the
latin
races
god
forgive
both
poor
devils
said
i
at
last
and
other
two
said
raffles
who
have
rather
more
to
be
forgiven
chapter
xix
apologia
on
one
of
the
worst
days
of
last
year
to
wit
the
first
day
of
the
eton
and
harrow
match
i
had
turned
into
the
hamman
in
jermyn
street
as
the
best
available
asylum
for
wet
boots
that
might
no
longer
enter
any
club
mine
had
been
removed
by
a
little
pinchbeck
oriental
in
the
outer
courts
and
i
wandered
within
unpleasantly
conscious
of
a
hole
in
one
sock
to
find
myself
by
no
means
the
only
obvious
refugee
from
the
rain
the
bath
was
in
fact
inconveniently
crowded
but
at
length
i
found
a
divan
to
suit
me
in
an
upstairs
alcove
i
had
the
choice
indeed
of
more
than
one
but
in
spite
of
my
antecedents
i
am
fastidious
about
my
cooling
companions
in
a
turkish
bath
and
it
was
by
no
accident
that
i
hung
my
clothes
opposite
to
a
newer
morning
coat
and
a
pair
of
trousers
more
decisively
creased
than
my
own
but
the
coincidence
in
pickle
was
no
less
remarkable
in
ensuing
stages
of
physical
devastation
one
had
dim
glimpses
of
a
not
unfamiliar
reddish
countenance
but
with
the
increment
of
years
it
has
been
my
lot
to
contract
short
sight
as
well
as
incipient
obesity
and
in
the
hot
rooms
my
glasses
lose
their
grip
upon
my
nose
so
it
was
not
until
i
lay
swathed
upon
my
divan
that
i
recognised
garland
in
the
fine
owner
of
the
nice
clothes
opposite
mine
a
tawny
moustache
rather
spoilt
him
as
phoebus
and
there
was
a
hint
of
old
gold
about
the
shaven
jaw
and
chin
but
i
never
saw
better
looks
of
the
unintellectual
order
and
the
amber
eye
was
as
clear
as
ever
the
great
strong
hand
unexpectedly
hearty
when
recognition
dawned
on
teddy
in
his
turn
he
spoke
of
raffles
without
hesitation
or
reserve
and
of
me
and
my
raffles
writings
as
though
there
was
nothing
reprehensible
in
one
or
the
other
displaying
indeed
a
flattering
knowledge
of
those
pious
memorials
but
of
course
i
take
them
with
a
grain
of
salt
said
teddy
garland
you
do
make
me
believe
you
were
either
of
you
such
desperate
dogs
as
all
that
i
ca
see
you
climbing
ropes
or
squirming
through
scullery
windows
even
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
he
added
with
somewhat
tardy
tact
it
is
certainly
rather
hard
to
credit
now
i
felt
that
after
all
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
being
too
fat
at
forty
and
that
teddy
garland
had
said
it
excellently
now
he
continued
if
only
you
would
give
us
the
row
between
raffles
and
dan
levy
i
mean
the
whole
battle
royal
that
fought
and
won
for
me
and
my
poor
father
that
would
be
something
like
the
world
would
see
the
sort
of
chap
he
really
was
i
am
afraid
it
would
have
to
see
the
sort
of
chaps
we
all
were
just
then
said
i
as
i
still
think
with
exemplary
delicacy
but
teddy
lay
silent
and
florid
for
some
time
these
athletes
have
their
vanity
but
this
one
rose
superior
to
his
manders
said
he
leaving
his
divan
and
coming
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
mine
you
have
my
free
leave
to
give
me
and
mine
away
to
the
four
winds
if
you
will
tell
the
truth
about
that
duel
and
what
raffles
did
for
the
lot
of
us
perhaps
he
did
more
than
you
ever
knew
put
it
all
in
it
was
a
longer
duel
than
you
think
he
once
called
it
a
guerilla
duel
then
make
a
book
of
it
but
i
written
my
last
word
about
the
old
boy
then
by
george
i
a
good
mind
to
write
it
myself
this
was
an
awful
threat
happily
he
lacked
the
materials
and
so
i
told
him
i
have
got
them
all
myself
i
added
only
to
be
politely
but
openly
disbelieved
i
do
know
where
you
were
said
i
all
that
first
day
of
the
match
when
it
rained
garland
was
beginning
to
smile
when
the
surprise
of
my
statement
got
home
and
changed
his
face
do
you
mean
to
say
never
told
you
he
cried
still
incredulously
no
he
would
give
you
away
not
even
to
you
his
pal
no
i
was
naturally
curious
on
the
point
but
he
refused
to
tell
me
what
a
chap
murmured
teddy
with
a
tender
enthusiasm
that
made
me
love
him
what
a
friend
for
a
fellow
well
manders
if
you
do
write
all
this
i
certainly
shall
so
i
may
as
well
tell
you
where
i
was
i
must
say
it
would
interest
me
to
know
my
companion
resumed
his
smile
where
he
had
left
it
off
i
wonder
if
you
would
ever
guess
he
speculated
looking
down
into
my
face
i
do
suppose
i
should
no
more
do
i
not
in
a
month
of
sundays
for
i
spent
that
day
on
the
very
sofa
i
was
on
a
minute
ago
i
looked
at
the
striped
divan
opposite
i
looked
at
teddy
garland
sitting
on
mine
his
smile
was
a
little
wry
with
the
remnant
of
his
bygone
shame
he
hurried
on
before
i
could
find
a
word
you
remember
that
drug
i
had
somnol
i
think
it
was
that
was
a
risky
game
to
play
with
any
head
but
one
own
still
was
right
in
thinking
i
should
have
been
worse
without
any
sleep
at
all
i
should
said
teddy
but
i
should
have
rolled
up
at
lord
the
beastly
stuff
put
me
asleep
all
right
but
it
did
keep
me
asleep
long
enough
i
was
awake
before
four
heard
you
both
talking
in
the
next
room
remembered
everything
in
a
flash
but
for
that
flash
i
should
have
dropped
off
again
in
a
minute
but
if
you
remember
all
i
had
to
remember
manders
you
wo
wonder
that
i
lay
madly
awake
all
the
rest
of
the
night
my
head
was
rotten
with
sleep
but
my
heart
was
in
such
hell
as
i
describe
to
you
if
i
tried
i
been
there
said
i
briefly
well
then
you
can
imagine
my
frightful
thoughts
suicide
was
one
but
to
get
out
of
that
came
first
to
get
away
without
looking
either
of
you
in
the
face
in
broad
daylight
so
i
shammed
sleep
when
raffles
looked
in
and
when
you
both
went
out
i
dressed
in
five
minutes
and
slunk
out
too
i
had
no
idea
where
i
was
going
i
do
remember
what
brought
me
down
into
this
street
it
may
have
been
my
debt
to
dan
levy
all
i
remember
is
finding
myself
opposite
this
place
my
head
splitting
and
the
sudden
idea
that
a
bath
might
freshen
me
up
and
could
make
me
worse
i
remembered
telling
me
he
had
once
taken
six
wickets
after
one
so
in
i
came
i
had
my
bath
and
some
tea
and
toast
in
the
we
were
all
to
have
a
late
breakfast
together
if
you
recollect
i
felt
i
should
be
in
plenty
of
time
for
that
and
lord
if
only
i
had
boiled
all
the
cricket
out
of
me
so
i
came
up
here
and
lay
down
there
but
what
i
had
boiled
out
was
that
beastly
drug
it
got
back
on
me
like
a
boomerang
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
minute
and
it
was
well
on
in
the
afternoon
when
i
awoke
here
teddy
interrupted
himself
to
order
whiskies
and
soda
of
a
metropolitan
who
happened
to
pass
along
the
gallery
and
to
go
stumbling
over
to
his
pockets
in
his
swaddling
towels
for
cigarettes
and
matches
and
the
rest
of
his
discourse
was
less
coherent
then
i
did
feel
it
was
a
between
my
razor
and
a
charge
of
shot
i
had
no
idea
it
was
raining
if
you
look
up
at
that
coloured
skylight
you
ca
say
if
it
raining
now
there
another
sort
of
hatchway
on
top
of
it
then
you
hear
that
fountain
tinkling
all
the
time
you
hear
any
rain
do
you
it
was
after
three
but
i
lay
till
nearly
four
simply
cursing
my
luck
there
was
no
hurry
then
at
last
i
wondered
what
the
papers
had
to
say
about
me
who
was
playing
in
my
place
who
won
the
toss
and
all
the
rest
of
it
so
i
had
the
nerve
to
send
out
for
one
and
what
should
i
see
play
at
and
sudden
illness
of
my
poor
old
father
you
know
the
rest
manders
because
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
after
that
we
met
and
i
remember
thinking
how
fit
you
looked
said
i
it
was
the
bath
of
course
and
the
sleep
on
top
of
it
but
i
wonder
they
let
you
sleep
so
long
how
could
they
know
what
i
been
up
to
said
teddy
i
might
have
had
any
sleep
for
a
week
it
was
their
business
to
let
me
be
but
to
think
of
the
rain
coming
on
and
saving
me
for
even
raffles
could
have
done
it
without
the
rain
that
was
the
great
slice
of
luck
while
i
was
lying
right
there
and
that
why
i
like
to
lie
there
still
for
luck
rather
than
remembrance
the
drinks
came
we
smoked
and
sipped
i
regretted
to
find
that
teddy
was
no
longer
faithful
to
the
only
old
cigarette
but
his
loyalty
to
raffles
won
my
heart
as
he
had
never
won
it
in
his
youth
give
us
away
to
your
heart
content
said
he
but
give
the
dear
old
devil
his
due
at
last
but
who
exactly
do
you
mean
by
my
father
not
so
much
perhaps
because
he
dead
and
gone
but
self
and
wife
as
much
as
ever
you
like
are
you
sure
garland
wo
mind
mind
it
was
for
her
he
did
it
all
did
you
know
that
i
did
know
teddy
knew
it
and
i
began
to
think
him
a
finer
fellow
than
i
had
supposed
am
i
to
say
all
i
know
about
that
too
i
asked
rather
camilla
and
i
will
both
be
delighted
so
long
as
you
change
our
names
for
we
both
loved
him
said
teddy
garland
i
wonder
if
they
both
forgive
me
for
taking
him
entirely
at
his
word
