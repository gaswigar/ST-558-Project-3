chapter

introducing
her
none
but
the
residents
consider
mount
mark
iowa
much
of
a
town
and
those
who
are
honest
among
them
admit
although
reluctantly
that
mount
mark
can
boast
of
far
more
patriotism
than
good
judgment
but
the
patriotic
of
them
all
has
no
word
of
praise
for
the
ugly
little
red
b
railway
station
if
pretty
is
as
pretty
does
as
we
have
been
told
so
unpleasantly
often
then
the
station
is
handsome
enough
but
as
an
ornament
to
the
commonwealth
it
is
a
dismal
failure
low
smoky
and
in
winter
its
bleakness
and
bareness
add
to
the
chill
of
the
rigorous
iowa
temperature
and
in
summer
the
sap
oozing
through
the
boards
is
disagreeably
suggestive
of
perspiration
the
itself
is
cleaned
every
day
and
yet
the
same
dust
lies
in
the
corners
where
it
has
lain
for
lo
these
many
years
and
as
for
the
cobwebs
their
chief
distinction
lies
in
their
ripe
old
age
if
there
were
only
seven
spiders
in
the
ark
after
the
subsiding
of
the
waters
at
least
a
majority
of
them
must
have
found
their
way
to
mount
mark
station
in
iowa
mount
mark
is
anything
but
proud
of
the
little
station
it
openly
scoffs
at
it
and
sniffs
contemptuously
at
the
ticket
agent
who
bears
the
entire
b
reputation
upon
his
humble
shoulders
at
the
same
time
it
certainly
does
owe
the
railroad
and
the
state
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
its
presence
there
it
is
the
favorite
social
rendezvous
for
the
community
only
four
passenger
trains
daily
pass
through
mount
mark
not
including
the
expresses
which
rush
haughtily
by
with
no
more
than
a
scornful
whistle
for
the
sleepy
town
and
in
return
for
this
indignity
mount
mark
cherishes
a
most
unchristian
antipathy
toward
those
demon
fliers
but
the
passengers
ah
that
is
a
different
matter
the
arrival
of
a
passenger
train
in
mount
mark
is
an
event
something
in
the
nature
of
a
b
q
at
home
and
is
always
attended
by
a
large
and
enthusiastic
gathering
of
our
best
people
all
that
is
lacking
are
the
proverbial
light
refreshments
so
it
happened
that
one
sultry
morning
late
in
the
month
of
august
there
was
the
usual
flutter
of
excitement
and
confusion
on
the
platform
and
in
the
of
the
station
the
habitu√©s
were
there
in
force
conspicuous
among
them
were
four
gaily
dressed
young
men
smoking
cigarettes
and
gazing
with
eyes
upon
the
animated
scene
which
evidently
bored
them
all
the
same
they
invariably
appeared
at
the
depot
to
witness
this
event
stirring
to
others
no
doubt
but
incapable
of
arousing
the
interest
of
these
youths
they
comprised
the
quartette
and
were
the
most
familiar
and
notorious
characters
in
all
the
town
daily
reporter
in
a
light
gray
suit
and
tan
shoes
and
with
scientifically
balanced
on
his
aquiline
nose
was
making
pointed
inquiries
into
the
private
plans
of
the
travelers
daily
reporters
in
mount
mark
always
wear
light
gray
suits
and
tan
shoes
and
always
have
scientifically
balanced
on
aquiline
noses
the
uninitiated
can
not
understand
how
it
is
managed
but
there
lies
the
fact
perhaps
includes
these
details
in
its
requirements
of
applicants
possibly
it
furnishes
the
gray
suits
and
the
tan
shoes
and
even
the
of
course
the
reporters
can
practise
balancing
them
scientifically
but
how
does
it
happen
that
they
always
have
aquiline
noses
at
any
rate
that
is
the
mount
mark
type
it
never
varies
the
young
woman
going
to
burlington
to
spend
the
was
surrounded
with
about
fifteen
other
young
women
who
had
come
to
see
her
off
she
had
relatives
in
burlington
and
went
there
very
often
and
she
used
to
say
she
was
glad
she
did
have
to
exchange
christmas
presents
with
all
the
friends
who
witnessed
her
arrivals
and
departures
at
the
station
mount
mark
is
a
very
respectable
town
be
it
understood
and
girls
do
not
go
to
the
station
without
an
excuse
the
adams
express
wagon
was
drawn
close
to
the
track
and
the
agent
was
rushing
about
with
a
breathless
energy
which
seemed
all
out
of
proportion
to
his
accomplishments
the
telegraph
operator
was
gazing
earnestly
out
of
his
open
window
and
his
hands
were
busily
moving
papers
from
one
to
another
and
back
again
old
harvey
reel
who
drove
the
hotel
bus
was
discussing
politics
with
the
man
who
kept
the
restaurant
and
the
baggage
master
superior
and
supremely
dirty
was
checking
baggage
with
his
almost
unendurably
lordly
air
this
was
one
of
the
four
daily
rejuvenations
that
gladdened
the
heart
of
mount
mark
a
man
in
a
black
business
suit
stood
alone
on
the
platform
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
wandering
from
one
to
another
of
the
strange
faces
about
him
his
plain
white
tie
proclaimed
his
calling
it
the
new
methodist
preacher
volunteered
the
baggage
master
crossing
the
platform
ostensibly
on
business
bound
but
really
to
see
who
all
was
there
i
know
him
he
not
a
bad
sort
they
say
he
got
five
kids
and
most
of
girls
responded
the
adams
express
man
i
ordered
me
a
dress
suit
to
pay
my
respects
in
when
they
get
here
i
want
to
be
on
hand
early
to
pick
me
out
a
girl
yah
mocked
the
telegraph
operator
bobbing
his
head
through
the
window
you
need
to
they
tell
me
every
girl
in
mount
mark
has
turned
you
down
but
the
methodist
minister
gazing
away
down
the
track
where
a
thin
curl
of
smoke
announced
the
coming
of
number
nine
and
prudence
heard
nothing
of
this
conversation
he
was
not
a
handsome
man
his
hair
was
gray
at
the
temples
his
face
was
earnest
only
saved
from
severity
by
the
little
clusters
of
lines
at
his
eyes
and
mouth
which
proclaimed
that
he
laughed
often
and
with
relish
train
going
east
the
minister
stood
back
from
the
crowd
but
when
the
train
came
pounding
in
a
brightness
leaped
into
his
eyes
that
entirely
changed
the
expression
of
his
face
a
slender
girl
stood
in
the
vestibule
leaning
dangerously
outward
and
waving
wildly
at
him
a
small
gloved
hand
when
the
train
stopped
she
leaped
lightly
from
the
steps
ignoring
the
stool
placed
for
her
feet
by
the
conductor
father
she
cried
excitedly
and
small
and
slight
as
she
was
she
elbowed
her
way
swiftly
through
the
gaping
crowd
oh
father
and
she
flung
her
arms
about
him
joyously
unconscious
of
the
admiring
eyes
of
the
adams
express
man
and
the
telegraph
operator
and
old
harvey
reel
whose
eyes
were
always
admiring
when
girls
passed
by
she
did
not
even
observe
that
the
slaughterhouse
quartette
looked
at
her
unanimously
with
languid
interest
from
out
the
wreaths
of
smoke
they
had
created
her
father
kissed
her
warmly
where
is
your
baggage
he
asked
a
hand
held
out
to
relieve
her
here
and
with
a
radiant
smile
she
thrust
upon
him
a
box
of
candy
and
a
magazine
your
he
explained
patiently
oh
she
gasped
run
father
run
i
left
it
on
the
train
father
did
run
but
prudence
him
and
clambered
on
board
panting
when
she
rejoined
her
father
her
face
was
flushed
oh
father
she
said
quite
snappily
is
that
just
like
me
yes
very
like
he
agreed
and
he
smiled
where
is
your
umbrella
prudence
stopped
abruptly
i
do
know
she
said
with
a
stony
face
i
ca
remember
a
blessed
thing
about
the
old
umbrella
oh
i
guess
i
did
bring
it
at
all
she
breathed
long
in
her
relief
yes
that
it
father
i
left
it
at
aunt
grace
do
you
worry
about
it
fairy
bring
it
is
it
nice
that
we
can
count
on
fairy
remembering
yes
very
nice
he
said
but
his
eyes
were
tender
as
he
looked
down
at
the
little
figure
beside
him
and
so
this
is
mount
mark
is
it
a
funny
name
father
why
do
they
call
it
mount
mark
i
do
know
i
had
thought
to
inquire
we
turn
here
prudence
we
are
going
north
now
this
is
main
street
the
city
part
of
the
town
the
business
part
is
to
the
south
it
a
pretty
street
is
it
she
cried
such
nice
big
maples
and
such
shady
porchy
houses
i
love
houses
with
porches
do
you
has
the
parsonage
a
porch
yes
a
big
one
on
the
south
and
a
tiny
one
in
front
the
house
faces
west
that
is
the
college
there
it
opens
in
three
weeks
and
fairy
can
make
freshmen
all
right
they
tell
me
i
wish
you
could
go
too
you
have
had
your
share
of
anything
any
good
thing
prudence
well
i
have
my
share
of
you
father
she
said
comfortingly
and
i
always
had
my
share
of
oatmeal
and
sorghum
molasses
though
one
would
think
it
to
look
at
me
fairy
gained
a
whole
inch
last
week
at
aunt
grace
she
was
so
disgusted
with
herself
she
says
not
be
able
to
look
back
on
the
visit
with
any
pleasure
at
all
just
because
of
that
inch
carol
said
she
ought
to
look
back
with
more
pleasure
because
there
an
inch
more
of
her
to
do
it
but
fairy
says
she
did
not
gain
the
inch
in
her
eyes
aunt
grace
laughed
every
minute
we
were
there
she
says
she
is
all
sore
up
and
down
from
laughing
so
much
we
have
the
house
fixed
up
pretty
well
prudence
but
of
course
have
to
go
over
it
yourself
and
arrange
it
as
you
like
but
remember
this
you
are
not
allowed
to
move
the
heavy
furniture
i
forbid
it
emphatically
there
is
enough
of
you
for
that
yes
i
remember
i
think
i
will
i
almost
certain
to
remember
some
things
you
know
i
must
go
to
a
trustees
meeting
at
two
but
we
can
get
a
good
deal
done
before
then
adams
is
coming
to
help
you
this
afternoon
she
is
one
of
our
ladies
and
very
kind
there
that
is
the
parsonage
prudence
gazed
in
silence
many
would
not
have
considered
it
a
beautiful
dwelling
but
to
prudence
it
was
heavenly
fortunately
the
wide
grassy
shaded
lawn
greeted
one
first
great
spreading
maples
bordered
the
street
and
clustering
lined
the
walk
leading
up
to
the
house
the
walk
was
badly
worn
and
broken
to
be
sure
but
the
roses
were
lovely
the
grass
had
been
carefully
cut
the
had
seen
to
that
the
parsonage
to
gratified
eyes
looked
homey
and
big
and
inviting
in
fact
it
was
very
nearly
gorgeous
it
needed
painting
badly
it
is
true
the
original
color
had
been
a
peculiar
drab
but
most
of
it
had
disappeared
long
before
so
it
was
no
eyesore
on
account
of
the
color
there
were
many
windows
and
the
lace
curtains
looked
down
upon
prudence
tripping
happily
up
the
little
board
walk
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
two
whole
stories
and
an
attic
besides
not
to
mention
the
bathroom
oh
father
the
night
after
you
wrote
there
was
a
bathroom
constance
thanked
god
for
it
when
she
said
her
prayers
and
i
could
reprove
her
for
i
felt
the
same
way
about
it
myself
it
be
so
splendid
to
have
a
whole
tub
to
bathe
in
i
spent
half
the
time
bathing
this
last
week
at
aunt
grace
a
tub
is
so
bountiful
a
pan
is
awfully
insufficient
father
even
for
me
i
often
think
what
a
trouble
it
must
be
to
fairy
and
a
furnace
too
and
electric
lights
do
you
think
there
is
something
in
the
idea
of
just
turning
a
little
knob
on
the
wall
and
flooding
a
whole
room
with
light
i
do
revel
in
electric
lights
i
tell
you
oh
we
have
waited
a
long
time
for
it
and
we
been
very
patient
indeed
but
between
you
and
me
father
i
am
most
mightily
glad
we
hit
the
at
last
sure
we
all
feel
much
more
religious
in
a
parsonage
that
has
a
bathroom
and
electric
lights
oh
father
he
had
thrown
open
the
door
and
prudence
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
her
new
home
it
was
not
a
fashionable
building
by
any
means
the
hall
was
narrow
and
long
and
the
staircase
was
just
a
plain
businesslike
staircase
with
no
room
for
cushions
and
flowers
and
books
the
doors
leading
from
the
hall
were
open
and
prudence
caught
a
glimpse
of
three
rooms
furnished
rather
scantily
in
the
old
familiar
furniture
that
had
been
in
that
other
parsonage
where
prudence
was
born
nineteen
years
before
together
she
and
her
father
went
from
room
to
room
and
down
moving
a
table
to
the
left
a
bed
to
the
right
according
to
her
own
good
pleasure
afterward
they
had
a
cozy
luncheon
for
two
in
the
oh
it
is
so
elegant
to
have
a
breathed
prudence
happily
i
always
pretended
it
was
rather
fun
and
a
great
saving
of
work
to
eat
and
cook
and
study
and
live
in
one
room
but
inwardly
the
idea
always
outraged
me
is
that
the
school
over
there
yes
that
where
connie
will
go
there
is
only
one
high
school
in
mount
mark
so
the
twins
will
have
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
town
a
long
walk
but
in
good
weather
they
can
come
home
for
afraid
the
kitchen
will
be
too
cold
in
winter
prudence
it
hardly
more
than
a
shed
really
maybe
we
oh
father
if
you
love
me
do
suggest
that
we
move
the
stove
in
here
in
winter
i
perfectly
willing
to
freeze
out
there
for
the
sake
of
having
a
did
i
ever
tell
you
what
carol
said
about
that
combination
at
exminster
well
she
asked
us
a
riddle
is
a
not
a
and
she
answered
it
herself
it
a
little
and
i
felt
so
badly
about
it
but
it
did
look
like
a
with
stove
here
and
cupboard
there
and
table
yonder
and
oh
no
father
please
let
me
freeze
i
confess
i
do
not
see
the
connection
between
a
roomful
of
furniture
and
a
but
carol
wit
is
often
too
subtle
for
me
oh
that
a
lovely
place
over
there
father
exclaimed
prudence
looking
from
the
windows
toward
the
south
is
it
beautiful
yes
the
avery
family
lives
there
the
parents
are
very
old
and
feeble
and
the
daughters
are
all
elderly
and
all
there
are
four
of
them
and
the
youngest
is
it
is
certainly
a
beautiful
place
see
the
orchard
out
behind
and
the
vineyard
they
are
very
wealthy
and
they
are
not
fond
of
children
outside
of
school
hours
i
am
told
so
we
must
keep
an
eye
on
dear
me
it
is
two
already
and
i
must
go
at
once
adams
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
you
will
not
be
lonely
but
when
adams
arrived
at
the
parsonage
she
knocked
repeatedly
and
in
vain
upon
the
front
door
after
that
she
went
to
the
side
door
with
no
better
result
finally
she
gathered
her
robes
about
her
and
went
into
the
back
yard
she
peered
into
the
woodshed
and
saw
no
one
she
went
into
the
and
found
it
empty
in
despair
she
plunged
into
the
barn
and
stopped
abruptly
in
a
shadowy
corner
was
a
slender
figure
kneeling
beside
an
overturned
nail
keg
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
evidently
this
was
prudence
engaged
in
prayer
and
in
the
barn
of
all
places
in
the
world
a
a
a
hem
stammered
adams
inquiringly
amen
this
was
spoken
aloud
and
hurriedly
and
prudence
leaped
to
her
feet
her
fair
hair
clung
about
her
face
in
damp
babyish
tendrils
and
her
face
was
flushed
and
dusty
but
alight
with
friendly
interest
she
ran
forward
eagerly
thrusting
forth
a
slim
and
grimy
hand
you
are
adams
are
you
i
am
prudence
starr
it
is
so
kind
of
you
to
come
the
very
first
day
she
cried
it
makes
me
love
you
right
at
the
start
ye
yes
i
am
mrs
adams
adams
was
embarrassed
she
could
not
banish
from
her
mental
vision
that
kneeling
figure
by
the
nail
keg
interrogation
was
written
all
over
her
ample
face
and
prudence
promptly
read
it
and
hastened
to
reply
i
do
not
generally
say
my
prayers
in
the
barn
adams
i
assure
you
i
suppose
you
were
greatly
surprised
i
did
expect
to
do
it
myself
when
i
came
out
here
but
well
when
i
found
this
grand
old
rambling
barn
i
was
so
thankful
i
could
resist
praying
about
it
of
course
i
did
specially
designate
the
barn
but
god
knew
what
i
meant
i
am
sure
but
a
barn
ejaculated
the
perplexed
member
do
you
call
that
a
blessing
yes
indeed
i
do
declared
prudence
then
she
explained
patiently
oh
it
is
on
the
children
account
you
know
they
have
always
longed
for
a
big
romantic
barn
to
play
in
we
never
had
anything
but
a
shed
and
when
father
went
to
conference
this
year
the
twins
told
him
particularly
to
look
out
for
a
good
big
barn
they
said
be
willing
to
put
up
with
any
kind
of
a
parsonage
if
only
we
might
draw
a
barn
for
once
you
ca
imagine
how
happy
this
dear
old
place
will
make
them
and
i
was
happy
on
their
account
that
why
i
could
resist
saying
my
prayers
i
was
so
happy
i
could
hold
in
as
they
walked
slowly
toward
the
house
adams
looked
at
this
parsonage
girl
in
frank
curiosity
and
some
dismay
which
she
strongly
endeavored
to
conceal
from
the
prudence
the
ladies
had
said
it
would
be
so
nice
to
have
a
grown
girl
in
the
parsonage
prudence
was
nineteen
from
all
account
but
she
looked
like
a
child
and
well
it
was
not
exactly
to
give
thanks
for
a
barn
to
say
the
very
least
yet
this
girl
had
full
charge
of
four
younger
children
and
was
further
burdened
with
the
entire
care
of
a
well
well
adams
sighed
a
little
you
are
tired
said
prudence
sympathetically
it
so
hot
walking
is
it
let
sit
on
the
porch
until
you
are
nicely
rested
this
a
lovely
yard
and
the
children
will
be
so
happy
to
have
this
delicious
big
porch
oh
i
just
adore
mount
mark
already
this
is
a
fine
chance
for
us
to
get
acquainted
said
the
good
woman
with
eagerness
now
if
the
truth
must
be
told
there
had
been
some
ill
feeling
in
the
ladies
aid
society
concerning
the
reception
of
prudence
after
the
session
of
conference
when
the
reverend
starr
was
assigned
to
mount
mark
the
ladies
of
the
church
had
felt
great
interest
in
the
man
and
his
family
they
inquired
on
every
hand
and
learned
several
interesting
items
the
mother
had
been
taken
from
the
family
five
years
before
after
a
long
illness
and
prudence
the
eldest
daughter
had
taken
charge
of
the
household
there
were
five
children
so
much
was
known
and
being
women
they
looked
forward
with
eager
curiosity
to
the
coming
of
prudence
the
young
mistress
of
the
parsonage
starr
had
arrived
at
mount
mark
a
week
ahead
of
his
family
the
furniture
had
been
shipped
from
his
previous
charge
and
he
with
the
assistance
of
a
strong
and
willing
negro
had
placed
it
according
to
the
written
instructions
of
prudence
who
had
conscientiously
outlined
just
what
should
go
in
every
room
she
and
the
other
children
had
spent
the
week
visiting
at
the
home
of
their
aunt
and
prudence
had
come
on
a
day
in
advance
of
the
others
to
wind
everything
up
as
she
had
expressed
it
but
to
return
to
the
ladies
the
parsonage
girls
always
capitalized
the
ladies
of
their
father
church
and
indeed
italicized
them
as
well
and
the
irrepressible
carol
had
been
heard
to
remark
i
often
feel
like
them
i
promise
you
but
to
return
once
more
one
of
us
should
go
and
help
the
dear
child
said
scott
the
president
of
the
aids
when
they
assembled
for
their
business
meeting
help
her
and
welcome
her
and
advise
her
i
was
thinking
of
going
over
said
one
and
another
and
several
others
oh
that
will
not
do
at
all
said
the
president
she
would
be
excited
meeting
so
many
strangers
and
could
not
properly
attend
to
her
work
that
will
never
do
never
never
but
one
of
us
must
go
of
course
i
move
that
the
president
appoint
a
committee
of
one
to
help
miss
prudence
get
settled
and
welcome
her
to
our
midst
said
barnaby
secretly
hoping
that
in
respect
for
her
making
this
suggestion
honoring
the
president
the
president
would
have
appreciation
enough
to
appoint
barnaby
herself
as
committee
the
motion
was
seconded
and
carried
well
said
scott
slowly
i
think
in
a
case
like
this
the
president
herself
should
represent
the
society
therefore
i
will
undertake
this
duty
for
you
but
this
called
forth
a
storm
of
protest
and
it
became
so
clamorous
that
it
was
unofficially
decided
to
draw
cuts
which
was
done
and
in
consequence
of
that
drawing
of
cuts
adams
now
sat
on
the
front
porch
of
the
old
gray
parsonage
cheered
by
the
knowledge
that
every
other
lady
of
the
aid
was
envying
her
now
just
be
real
sociable
and
tell
me
all
about
yourself
and
the
others
too
urged
adams
i
want
to
know
all
about
every
one
of
you
tell
me
everything
there
is
much
to
tell
said
prudence
smiling
there
are
five
of
us
i
am
the
oldest
i
am
nineteen
then
comes
fairy
then
the
twins
and
then
the
baby
are
the
twins
boys
or
a
boy
and
a
girl
neither
said
prudence
they
are
both
girls
more
girls
gasped
adams
and
the
baby
she
is
a
girl
too
and
prudence
laughed
in
short
we
are
all
girls
except
father
he
could
be
of
course
or
i
suppose
he
would
for
our
family
does
seem
to
run
to
girls
prudence
is
a
very
nice
name
for
a
minister
daughter
said
adams
suggestively
yes
for
some
ministers
daughters
assented
prudence
but
is
sadly
unsuitable
for
me
you
see
father
and
mother
were
very
enthusiastic
about
the
first
baby
who
had
arrived
they
had
two
names
all
picked
out
months
ahead
prudence
and
john
wesley
how
i
happen
to
be
prudence
they
thought
as
you
do
that
it
was
an
uplifting
name
for
a
parsonage
i
was
only
three
years
old
when
fairy
was
born
but
already
they
realized
that
they
had
made
a
great
mistake
so
they
decided
to
christen
baby
number
two
more
appropriately
they
chose
frank
and
fairy
both
happy
cheerful
it
fairy
prudence
smiled
reflectively
but
things
went
badly
again
they
were
very
unlucky
with
their
babies
fairy
is
prudence
by
nature
and
i
am
fairy
she
is
tall
and
a
little
inclined
to
be
fat
she
is
steady
and
industrious
and
reliable
and
sensible
and
clever
in
fact
she
is
an
solid
and
worthwhile
girl
she
can
do
anything
and
do
it
right
and
is
going
to
be
a
college
professor
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
think
of
a
college
professor
being
called
fairy
all
her
life
is
it
especially
when
she
is
so
dignified
and
grand
but
one
simply
ca
tell
beforehand
what
to
expect
can
one
father
and
mother
were
quite
discouraged
by
that
time
they
hardly
knew
what
to
do
but
anyhow
they
were
sure
the
next
would
be
a
boy
every
one
predicted
a
boy
and
so
they
chose
a
good
old
methodist
name
charles
they
hated
to
give
it
john
wesley
for
they
had
sort
of
dedicated
that
to
me
you
know
only
i
happened
to
be
prudence
but
charles
was
and
they
were
very
happy
about
it
and
it
was
twin
girls
it
was
quite
a
blow
i
guess
but
they
rallied
swiftly
and
called
them
carol
and
lark
such
nice
musical
names
father
and
mother
were
both
good
singers
and
mother
a
splendid
pianist
and
fairy
and
i
showed
musical
symptoms
early
in
life
so
they
thought
they
could
be
far
wrong
that
time
it
was
a
bitter
mistake
it
seemed
to
turn
the
twins
against
music
right
from
the
start
carol
can
carry
a
tune
if
there
a
strong
voice
beside
her
but
lark
can
hardly
tell
the
difference
between
spangled
and
of
the
neighbors
were
kind
of
amused
by
then
and
mother
was
very
sensitive
about
it
so
the
next
time
she
determined
to
get
ahead
of
fate
more
nonsense
now
said
mother
almost
certain
to
be
a
boy
and
we
call
him
william
after
father
and
billy
for
short
we
all
liked
the
name
billy
mother
especially
but
she
could
call
father
anything
but
william
we
being
parsonage
people
you
know
but
she
kept
looking
forward
to
little
billy
and
then
they
changed
it
in
a
hurry
to
constance
and
after
that
father
and
mother
gave
the
whole
thing
up
as
a
bad
job
there
are
any
more
of
us
connie
settled
the
baby
business
in
our
family
adams
wiped
her
eyes
and
leaned
weakly
back
in
her
chair
gasping
for
breath
well
i
swan
was
all
she
could
say
at
that
moment
while
giving
herself
time
to
recover
her
mental
poise
she
looked
critically
at
this
young
daughter
of
the
parsonage
then
her
eyes
wandered
down
to
her
clothes
and
lingered
in
silent
questioning
on
prudence
dress
it
was
a
very
peculiar
color
in
fact
it
was
no
color
at
all
no
named
color
prudence
eyes
had
followed
adams
glance
and
she
spoke
frankly
i
suppose
you
wondering
if
this
dress
is
any
color
well
i
think
it
really
is
but
it
is
any
of
the
regular
shades
it
is
my
own
invention
but
i
never
named
it
we
could
think
of
anything
appropriate
carol
suggested
shade
but
i
could
bring
myself
to
accept
that
of
course
adams
you
understand
how
parsonage
people
do
with
clothes
handing
them
down
from
generation
unto
generation
well
i
did
mind
it
at
first
when
i
was
the
biggest
but
all
of
a
sudden
fairy
grew
up
and
out
and
around
and
one
day
when
i
was
so
nearly
out
of
clothes
i
hardly
felt
that
i
could
attend
church
any
more
she
suggested
that
i
cut
an
old
one
of
hers
down
for
me
at
first
i
laughed
and
then
i
was
insulted
fairy
is
three
years
younger
than
i
and
before
then
she
had
got
my
but
now
the
tables
were
turned
from
that
time
on
whenever
anything
happened
to
fairy
clothes
so
a
gore
had
to
be
cut
out
or
the
bottom
taken
off
they
were
cut
down
for
me
i
still
feel
bitter
about
it
fairy
is
dark
and
dark
blues
are
becoming
to
her
she
handed
down
this
dress
it
was
dark
blue
then
but
i
was
not
wanting
a
dark
blue
and
i
thought
it
would
be
less
recognizable
if
i
gave
it
a
contrasting
color
i
chose
lavender
i
dyed
it
four
times
and
this
was
the
result
do
the
twins
dress
alike
inquired
adams
when
she
could
control
her
voice
yes
unfortunately
for
connie
they
do
it
on
purpose
to
escape
the
they
wo
even
have
hair
ribbons
different
and
the
result
is
that
poor
connie
never
gets
one
new
thing
except
shoes
she
says
she
can
not
help
thanking
the
lord
in
her
prayers
that
all
of
us
outwear
our
shoes
before
we
can
outgrow
connie
is
only
nine
fairy
is
sixteen
and
the
twins
are
thirteen
they
are
a
very
clever
lot
of
girls
fairy
as
i
told
you
is
just
naturally
smart
and
aims
to
be
a
college
professor
lark
is
an
intelligent
studious
girl
and
is
going
to
be
an
author
carol
is
pretty
and
lovable
and
and
witty
but
not
deep
she
is
going
to
be
a
red
cross
nurse
and
go
to
war
the
twins
have
it
all
planned
out
carol
is
going
to
war
as
a
red
cross
nurse
and
lark
is
going
too
so
she
can
write
a
book
about
it
and
they
are
both
going
to
marry
soldiers
preferably
dashing
young
generals
now
they
can
hardly
wait
for
war
to
break
out
connie
is
a
sober
odd
sensitive
little
thing
and
has
decided
whether
she
wants
to
be
a
foreign
missionary
or
get
married
and
have
ten
but
they
are
all
clever
and
i
proud
of
every
one
of
them
and
what
are
you
going
to
be
inquired
adams
looking
with
real
affection
at
the
bright
sweet
face
but
prudence
laughed
oh
dear
me
adams
seems
to
me
if
i
just
get
the
others
raised
up
properly
i
have
my
hands
full
i
used
to
have
aims
dozens
of
them
now
i
have
just
one
and
i
working
at
it
every
day
you
ought
to
go
to
school
declared
adams
you
just
a
girl
yourself
i
do
want
to
go
to
school
laughed
prudence
not
any
more
i
like
it
just
taking
care
of
father
and
the
girls
with
fairy
to
keep
me
balanced
i
read
but
i
do
not
like
to
no
you
have
to
get
along
with
me
just
the
way
i
am
adams
it
all
i
can
do
to
keep
things
going
now
without
spending
half
the
time
dreaming
of
big
things
to
do
in
the
future
do
you
have
dreams
gasped
adams
do
you
have
dreams
of
the
future
girls
in
books
nowadays
dream
yes
i
dream
interrupted
prudence
i
dream
lots
but
it
mostly
of
what
fairy
and
the
others
will
do
when
i
get
them
properly
raised
you
like
the
girls
adams
i
know
you
will
they
really
are
a
gifted
little
bunch
except
me
but
i
do
mind
it
a
great
honor
for
me
to
have
the
privilege
of
bringing
up
four
clever
girls
to
do
great
things
do
you
think
and
i
only
nineteen
myself
i
see
what
more
a
body
could
want
it
seems
to
me
said
adams
that
i
know
more
about
your
sisters
than
i
do
about
you
i
feel
more
acquainted
with
them
right
now
than
with
you
that
so
too
said
prudence
nodding
but
they
are
the
ones
that
really
count
you
know
i
just
common
little
prudence
of
the
parsonage
but
the
others
and
prudence
flung
out
her
hands
dramatically
chapter
ii
the
rest
of
the
family
it
was
saturday
morning
when
the
four
young
parsonage
girls
arrived
in
mount
mark
the
elderly
misses
avery
next
door
looked
out
of
their
windows
pending
their
appearance
on
main
street
with
interest
and
concern
it
was
a
serious
matter
this
having
a
whole
of
young
girls
so
close
to
the
old
avery
mansion
to
be
sure
the
averys
had
a
deep
and
profound
respect
for
ministerial
households
but
they
were
episcopalians
themselves
and
in
all
their
long
lives
they
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
a
with
five
daughters
and
no
housekeeper
there
was
something
in
the
bare
idea
the
misses
avery
considered
prudence
herself
rather
a
sweet
silly
little
thing
you
have
some
real
nice
people
in
the
methodist
church
miss
dora
had
told
her
i
dare
say
you
will
find
a
few
of
them
very
likeable
oh
i
will
like
them
all
said
prudence
quickly
and
seriously
like
them
all
echoed
miss
dora
oh
impossible
not
for
us
said
prudence
we
are
used
to
it
you
know
we
always
like
people
that
is
ridiculous
said
miss
dora
it
is
absolutely
impossible
one
ca
of
course
as
christians
we
must
tolerate
and
try
to
help
every
one
but
christian
tolerance
and
love
are
oh
excuse
me
but
really
i
ca
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
christian
tolerance
said
prudence
firmly
there
is
christian
love
and
that
is
all
we
need
then
leaning
forward
what
do
you
do
miss
avery
when
you
meet
people
you
dislike
at
very
first
sight
keep
away
from
them
was
the
grim
reply
exactly
and
keep
on
disliking
them
said
prudence
triumphantly
it
very
different
with
us
when
we
dislike
people
at
first
sight
we
visit
them
and
talk
to
them
and
invite
them
to
the
parsonage
and
entertain
them
with
our
best
linen
and
silverware
and
keep
on
getting
friendlier
and
friendlier
and
first
thing
you
know
we
like
them
fine
it
a
perfectly
splendid
rule
and
it
has
never
failed
us
once
try
it
miss
avery
do
you
will
be
enthusiastic
about
it
i
know
so
the
misses
avery
concluded
that
prudence
was
very
young
and
seem
to
quite
outgrow
it
she
was
not
entirely
responsible
and
they
wondered
with
something
akin
to
an
agony
of
fear
if
the
younger
girls
had
it
too
therefore
the
misses
avery
kept
watch
at
their
respective
windows
and
when
miss
alice
cried
excitedly
quick
quick
they
are
coming
they
trooped
to
miss
alice
window
with
a
speed
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
parsonage
girls
themselves
first
came
the
minister
whom
they
knew
very
well
by
this
time
and
considered
quite
respectable
he
was
lively
as
was
to
be
expected
of
a
methodist
minister
and
told
jokes
and
laughed
at
them
now
a
comical
rector
oh
a
very
different
matter
it
was
done
that
all
at
any
rate
here
came
the
methodist
minister
laughing
and
on
one
side
of
him
tripped
a
small
maiden
clasping
his
hand
and
gazing
alternately
up
into
his
face
and
down
at
the
stylish
cement
sidewalk
beneath
her
feet
on
the
other
side
was
fairy
the
misses
avery
knew
the
girls
by
name
already
having
talked
much
with
prudence
such
a
fairy
gasped
miss
millicent
and
the
others
echoed
the
gasp
but
wordlessly
for
fairy
for
very
nearly
as
tall
as
her
father
built
upon
generous
lines
rather
commanding
in
appearance
a
little
even
from
their
windows
they
could
discern
something
distinctly
in
this
girl
with
the
easy
elastic
stride
that
matched
her
father
and
the
graceful
head
well
carried
a
young
goddess
named
fairy
behind
them
laughing
and
chattering
like
three
children
as
they
were
came
the
twins
with
prudence
each
with
an
arm
around
her
waist
and
prudence
was
very
little
taller
than
they
when
they
reached
the
fence
that
bordered
the
parsonage
the
scene
for
a
moment
resembled
a
miniature
riot
the
smaller
girls
jumped
and
exclaimed
and
clasped
their
hands
fairy
leaned
over
the
fence
and
stared
intently
at
this
their
parsonage
home
then
the
serious
little
girl
scrambled
under
the
fence
followed
closely
by
the
twins
a
pause
a
very
short
one
and
then
prudence
too
was
wriggling
beneath
the
fence
hold
the
wire
up
for
me
papa
cried
fairy
i
too
fat
and
a
second
later
she
was
running
gracefully
across
the
lawn
toward
the
parsonage
the
methodist
minister
laughed
boyishly
and
placing
his
hands
on
the
he
vaulted
lightly
over
and
reached
the
house
with
his
daughters
then
the
misses
avery
and
elderly
looked
at
one
another
did
you
ever
whispered
the
oldest
miss
avery
and
the
others
slowly
shook
their
heads
now
think
did
you
ever
see
a
rector
jumping
a
fence
and
running
full
speed
across
his
front
yard
in
pursuit
of
a
flying
family
it
may
possibly
have
occurred
we
have
never
seen
it
neither
had
the
misses
avery
nor
did
they
ever
expect
to
and
if
they
had
seen
it
it
is
quite
likely
they
would
have
joined
the
backsliders
at
that
instant
but
without
wasting
much
time
on
this
gruesome
thought
they
hurried
to
a
window
commanding
the
best
view
of
the
parsonage
and
raised
it
then
they
clustered
behind
the
curtains
and
watched
and
listened
there
was
plenty
to
hear
from
the
parsonage
windows
came
the
sound
of
scampering
feet
and
banging
doors
once
there
was
the
unmistakable
clatter
of
a
chair
overturned
with
it
all
there
was
a
constant
chorus
of
oh
look
oh
oh
oh
how
sweet
oh
papa
oh
prudence
look
larkie
look
at
this
then
the
thud
of
many
feet
speeding
down
the
stairs
and
the
slam
of
a
door
and
the
slam
of
a
gate
the
whole
had
poured
out
into
the
back
yard
and
the
into
the
chicken
coop
they
raced
the
minister
ever
close
upon
their
heels
over
the
board
fence
they
clambered
to
the
big
rambling
barn
and
the
wide
door
swung
closed
after
them
but
in
a
few
seconds
they
were
out
once
more
by
the
back
barn
door
and
over
the
fence
and
on
to
the
field
there
they
closed
ranks
with
their
arms
recklessly
around
whoever
was
nearest
and
made
a
thorough
tour
of
the
bit
of
for
some
moments
they
leaned
upon
the
dividing
fence
and
gazed
admiringly
into
the
rich
orchard
and
vineyard
of
the
avery
estate
but
soon
they
were
skipping
back
to
the
parsonage
again
and
the
kitchen
door
banged
behind
them
then
the
eldest
miss
avery
closed
the
window
overlooking
the
parsonage
and
confronted
her
sisters
we
must
just
make
the
best
of
it
she
said
quietly
but
next
door
the
gray
old
ugly
parsonage
was
full
to
overflowing
with
satisfaction
and
happiness
and
love
the
starrs
had
never
had
an
appointment
like
this
before
they
had
just
come
from
the
village
of
exminster
of
five
hundred
inhabitants
there
the
reverend
starr
had
filled
the
pulpits
of
three
small
methodist
churches
scattered
at
random
throughout
the
country
consideration
five
hundred
dollars
but
here
why
mount
mark
had
a
population
of
fully
three
thousand
and
a
business
academy
and
the
presbyterian
college
small
to
be
sure
but
the
name
had
a
grand
and
inspiring
sound
and
starr
had
to
fill
only
one
pulpit
it
was
heavenly
that
what
it
was
to
be
sure
many
of
his
people
lived
out
in
the
country
necessitating
the
upkeep
of
a
horse
for
the
sake
of
his
pastoral
work
but
that
was
only
an
advantage
also
to
be
sure
the
methodists
in
mount
mark
were
in
a
minority
and
an
inferiority
mount
mark
being
a
presbyterian
stronghold
due
to
the
homing
there
of
the
trim
and
orderly
little
college
but
what
of
that
the
salary
was
six
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
the
parsonage
was
adorable
the
parsonage
family
could
see
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
the
world
that
day
and
the
future
was
every
one
has
experienced
the
ecstatic
creepy
sensation
of
sleeping
in
a
home
the
parsonage
girls
reveled
in
the
memory
of
that
first
night
for
many
days
it
may
be
haunted
for
all
we
know
cried
carol
deliciously
just
think
connie
there
may
be
seven
ghosts
camped
on
the
head
of
your
bed
waiting
carol
when
the
family
gathered
for
worship
on
that
first
sabbath
morning
starr
said
as
he
turned
the
leaves
of
his
bible
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
girls
to
help
with
the
morning
worship
now
you
need
practise
in
praying
aloud
and
so
we
will
begin
connie
and
i
will
make
the
prayers
this
morning
prudence
and
carol
and
fairy
and
lark
the
next
day
we
will
keep
that
system
up
for
a
while
anyhow
when
i
finish
reading
the
chapter
connie
you
will
make
the
first
prayer
just
pray
for
whatever
you
wish
as
you
do
at
night
for
yourself
i
will
follow
you
connie
eyes
were
wide
with
responsibility
during
the
reading
of
the
chapter
but
when
she
began
to
speak
her
voice
did
not
falter
connie
had
nine
years
of
good
methodist
experience
back
of
her
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
we
bow
ourselves
before
thy
footstool
in
humility
and
reverence
thou
art
our
god
our
creator
our
saviour
bless
us
this
day
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
upon
us
blot
out
our
transgressions
pardon
our
trespasses
wash
us
that
we
may
be
whiter
than
snow
hide
not
thy
face
from
the
eyes
of
thy
children
turn
not
upon
us
in
wrath
pity
us
lord
as
we
kneel
here
prostrate
before
thy
majesty
and
glory
let
the
words
of
our
mouths
and
the
meditations
of
our
hearts
be
acceptable
in
thy
sight
o
lord
our
strength
and
our
redeemer
and
finally
save
us
an
unbroken
family
around
thy
throne
in
heaven
for
jesus
sake
amen
this
was
followed
by
an
electric
silence
prudence
was
biting
her
lips
painfully
and
counting
by
tens
as
fast
as
she
could
fairy
was
mentally
going
over
the
prayer
sentence
by
sentence
and
attributing
each
petition
to
the
individual
member
in
the
old
church
at
exminster
to
whom
it
belonged
the
twins
were
a
little
amazed
and
quite
proud
connie
was
an
honor
to
the
parsonage
but
they
were
concerned
lest
they
themselves
should
do
not
quite
so
well
when
their
days
came
but
in
less
than
a
moment
the
began
his
prayer
his
voice
was
a
little
subdued
and
he
prayed
with
less
fervor
and
abandon
than
usual
but
otherwise
things
went
off
quite
nicely
when
he
said
amen
prudence
was
on
her
feet
and
before
the
others
were
fairly
risen
fairy
stood
gazing
intently
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
and
then
went
out
to
the
barn
to
see
if
the
horse
was
through
eating
starr
walked
gravely
and
soberly
out
the
front
door
and
around
the
house
he
ran
into
fairy
coming
out
the
kitchen
door
and
they
glanced
quickly
at
each
other
hurry
papa
she
whispered
you
ca
hold
in
much
longer
neither
can
i
and
together
choking
with
laughter
they
hurried
into
the
barn
and
gave
full
vent
to
their
feelings
so
it
was
that
the
twins
and
connie
were
alone
for
a
while
you
did
a
pretty
good
job
connie
said
carol
approvingly
yes
i
think
i
did
myself
was
the
complacent
answer
but
i
intended
to
put
in
us
as
the
apple
of
thy
eye
hold
us
in
the
hollow
of
thy
hand
and
i
forgot
it
until
i
had
said
i
had
a
notion
to
put
in
a
but
i
believe
that
is
done
never
mind
said
carol
i
use
that
in
mine
it
can
not
be
said
that
this
form
of
family
worship
was
a
great
success
the
twins
were
invariably
stereotyped
cut
and
dried
they
thanked
the
lord
for
the
beautiful
morning
for
kind
friends
for
health
and
family
and
parsonage
connie
always
prayed
in
sentences
extracted
from
the
prayers
of
others
she
had
often
heard
and
every
time
with
nearly
disastrous
effect
but
the
days
passed
around
and
prudence
and
carol
turn
came
again
carol
was
a
thoughtless
impetuous
impulsive
girl
and
her
prayers
were
as
nearly
verbal
repetitions
as
any
prayers
could
be
so
on
this
morning
after
the
reading
of
the
chapter
carol
knelt
by
her
chair
and
began
in
her
customary
solemn
voice
oh
our
father
we
thank
thee
for
this
beautiful
morning
then
intense
silence
for
carol
remembered
with
horror
and
shame
that
it
was
a
dreary
dismal
morning
cloudy
ugly
and
all
unlovely
in
her
despair
the
rest
of
her
petition
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
she
could
think
of
another
word
so
she
gulped
and
stammered
out
a
faint
amen
but
prudence
could
not
begin
prudence
was
red
in
the
face
and
nearly
suffocated
she
felt
all
swollen
inside
she
could
speak
the
silence
continued
oh
why
does
father
do
it
she
wondered
as
a
matter
of
fact
father
could
but
prudence
did
not
know
that
one
who
laughs
often
gets
in
the
habit
of
laughter
and
sometimes
laughs
out
of
season
as
well
as
in
finally
prudence
plunged
in
desperately
dear
father
as
she
usually
began
her
sweet
intimate
little
talks
with
god
and
then
she
paused
before
her
eyes
flashed
a
picture
of
the
beautiful
morning
for
which
carol
had
just
been
thankful
she
tried
again
dear
father
and
then
she
whirled
around
on
the
floor
and
laughed
starr
got
up
from
his
knees
sat
down
on
his
chair
and
literally
shook
fairy
rolled
on
the
lounge
screaming
with
merriment
even
sober
little
connie
giggled
and
squealed
but
carol
could
not
get
up
she
was
disgraced
she
had
done
a
horrible
disgusting
idiotic
thing
she
had
insulted
god
she
could
never
face
the
family
again
her
shoulders
rose
and
fell
convulsively
lark
did
not
laugh
either
with
a
rush
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
carol
her
arms
around
the
heaving
shoulders
do
you
care
carrie
she
whispered
do
you
care
it
was
just
a
mistake
do
cry
carrie
but
carol
would
not
be
comforted
she
tried
to
sneak
unobserved
from
the
room
but
her
father
stopped
her
do
feel
so
badly
about
it
carol
he
said
kindly
really
sorry
for
the
stricken
child
though
his
eyes
still
twinkled
it
was
just
a
mistake
but
remember
after
this
my
child
to
speak
to
god
when
you
pray
remember
that
you
are
talking
to
him
then
you
will
not
make
such
a
so
many
of
us
he
said
reflectively
ministers
as
well
as
others
pray
into
the
ears
of
the
people
and
forget
we
are
talking
to
god
after
that
the
morning
worship
went
better
the
prayers
of
the
children
changed
became
more
personal
less
flowery
they
remembered
from
that
time
on
that
when
they
knelt
they
were
at
the
feet
of
god
and
speaking
direct
to
him
it
was
the
hated
duty
of
the
twins
to
wash
and
dry
the
dishes
taking
turns
about
with
the
washing
this
time
was
always
given
up
to
for
lark
had
a
strange
and
wonderful
imagination
and
carol
listened
to
her
tales
with
wonder
and
delight
even
connie
found
hours
irresistible
and
could
invariably
be
found
face
in
her
hands
both
elbows
on
the
table
gazing
with
passionate
earnestness
at
the
young
now
some
of
lark
stories
were
such
weird
and
fearful
things
that
they
had
seriously
interfered
with
connie
slumbers
and
prudence
had
sternly
prohibited
them
but
this
evening
just
as
she
opened
the
kitchen
door
she
heard
lark
say
in
thrilling
tones
she
crept
down
the
stairs
in
the
deep
darkness
her
hand
sliding
lightly
over
the
rail
suddenly
she
stopped
her
hand
was
arrested
in
its
movement
fingers
gripped
hers
tightly
then
with
one
piercing
shriek
she
plunged
forward
and
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
with
a
terrific
crash
while
a
mocking
laugh
the
kitchen
door
slammed
sharply
behind
prudence
as
she
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
connie
piercing
shriek
would
surely
have
rivaled
that
of
lark
unfortunate
heroine
even
carol
started
nervously
and
let
the
plate
she
had
been
solemnly
wiping
for
nine
minutes
fall
to
the
floor
lark
gasped
and
then
began
sheepishly
washing
dishes
as
though
her
life
depended
on
it
the
water
was
cold
and
little
masses
of
grease
clung
to
the
edges
of
the
pan
and
floated
about
on
the
surface
of
the
water
get
fresh
hot
water
lark
and
finish
the
dishes
connie
go
right
to
bed
you
twins
can
come
in
to
me
as
soon
as
you
finish
but
connie
was
afraid
to
go
to
bed
alone
and
prudence
was
obliged
to
accompany
her
so
it
was
in
their
own
room
that
the
twins
finally
faced
an
indignant
prudence
carol
you
may
go
right
straight
to
bed
and
lark
i
do
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
with
you
why
do
you
mind
me
and
do
as
i
tell
you
how
many
times
have
i
told
you
not
to
tell
weird
stories
like
that
ca
you
tell
nice
interesting
mild
stories
prudence
as
sure
as
you
live
i
ca
i
start
them
just
as
mild
and
proper
as
can
be
but
before
i
get
through
a
murder
or
death
or
mystery
crops
in
and
i
ca
help
it
but
you
must
help
it
lark
or
i
shall
forbid
your
telling
stories
of
any
kind
they
are
so
silly
those
wild
things
and
they
make
you
all
nervous
and
excitable
and
now
think
larkie
and
tell
me
how
i
shall
punish
you
lark
applied
all
the
resources
of
her
wonderful
brain
to
this
task
and
presently
suggested
reluctantly
well
you
might
keep
me
home
from
the
social
night
but
her
face
was
wistful
no
said
prudence
decidedly
to
lark
intense
relief
i
ca
do
that
you
been
looking
forward
to
it
so
long
and
your
class
is
to
help
with
the
serving
no
not
that
larkie
that
would
be
too
mean
think
of
something
else
well
you
might
make
me
wash
and
dry
the
dishes
all
alone
for
a
week
prudence
and
that
will
be
a
bad
punishment
too
for
i
just
despise
washing
dishes
by
myself
telling
stories
makes
it
so
much
livelier
all
right
then
said
prudence
relieved
in
turn
that
is
what
i
will
do
and
carol
and
connie
must
not
even
stay
in
the
kitchen
with
you
i
believe
i
go
to
bed
now
too
said
lark
with
a
thoughtful
glance
at
her
two
sisters
already
curled
up
snugly
and
waiting
for
the
conclusion
of
the
administering
of
justice
if
you
do
mind
prudence
prudence
smiled
a
bit
ruefully
oh
i
suppose
you
might
as
well
if
you
like
but
remember
this
lark
no
more
deaths
and
murders
and
mysteries
and
highway
robberies
all
right
prudence
said
lark
with
determination
and
as
prudence
walked
slowly
she
heard
lark
starting
in
on
her
next
story
once
there
was
a
handsome
young
man
named
archibald
tremaine
a
very
respectable
young
fellow
he
would
so
much
as
dream
of
robbing
or
murdering
or
dying
then
prudence
smiled
to
herself
in
the
dark
and
hurried
down
the
family
had
been
in
the
new
parsonage
only
three
weeks
when
a
visiting
minister
called
on
them
it
was
about
ten
minutes
before
the
luncheon
hour
at
the
time
of
his
arrival
starr
was
in
the
country
visiting
so
the
girls
received
him
alone
it
was
an
unfortunate
day
for
the
starrs
fairy
had
been
at
college
all
morning
and
prudence
had
been
rummaging
in
the
attic
getting
it
ready
for
a
and
winter
playroom
for
the
younger
girls
she
was
dusty
perspirey
and
tired
the
luncheon
hour
arrived
and
the
girls
came
in
from
school
eager
to
be
up
and
away
again
still
the
grave
young
minister
sat
discoursing
upon
serious
topics
with
the
fidgety
prudence
and
in
spite
of
dust
and
perspiration
she
was
good
to
look
upon
the
reverend
morgan
realized
that
and
could
not
tear
himself
away
the
twins
came
in
shook
hands
with
him
soberly
glancing
significantly
at
the
clock
as
they
did
so
connie
ran
in
excitedly
wanting
to
know
what
was
the
matter
with
everybody
and
were
they
to
have
any
luncheon
still
morgan
remained
in
his
chair
gazing
at
prudence
with
frank
appreciation
finally
prudence
sighed
do
you
like
sweet
corn
mr
morgan
this
was
entirely
out
of
the
line
of
their
conversation
and
for
a
moment
he
faltered
sweet
corn
he
repeated
yes
you
know
cooked
on
the
cob
then
he
smiled
oh
yes
indeed
very
much
he
said
well
she
began
her
explanation
rather
drearily
i
was
busy
this
morning
and
did
not
prepare
much
luncheon
we
are
very
fond
of
sweet
corn
and
i
cooked
an
enormous
panful
but
that
all
we
have
for
luncheon
sweet
corn
and
butter
we
have
even
bread
because
i
am
going
to
bake
this
afternoon
and
we
never
eat
it
with
sweet
corn
anyhow
now
if
you
care
to
eat
sweet
corn
and
butter
and
canned
peaches
we
just
love
to
have
you
stay
for
luncheon
with
us
the
reverend
morgan
was
charmed
and
said
so
so
prudence
rushed
to
the
kitchen
opened
the
peaches
in
a
hurry
and
fished
out
a
clean
napkin
for
their
guest
then
they
gathered
about
the
table
five
girls
and
the
visiting
minister
it
was
really
a
curious
sight
that
table
in
the
center
stood
a
tall
vase
of
goldenrod
on
either
side
of
the
vase
was
a
great
platter
piled
high
with
sweet
corn
on
the
cob
around
the
table
were
six
plates
with
the
necessary
silverware
and
a
glass
of
water
for
each
there
was
also
a
small
dish
of
peaches
at
each
place
and
an
individual
plate
of
butter
that
was
all
except
the
napkins
but
prudence
made
no
apologies
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
parsonage
she
showed
the
reverend
morgan
to
his
place
as
graciously
and
sweetly
as
though
she
were
ushering
him
in
to
a
course
banquet
will
you
return
thanks
mr
morgan
she
said
and
the
girls
bowed
their
heads
the
reverend
morgan
cleared
his
throat
and
began
our
father
we
thank
thee
for
this
table
there
was
more
of
the
blessing
but
the
parsonage
girls
heard
not
one
additional
phrase
except
connie
who
followed
him
conscientiously
through
every
word
by
the
time
he
had
finished
prudence
and
fairy
and
even
lark
had
composed
their
faces
but
carol
burst
into
merry
laughter
close
upon
his
reverent
amen
and
after
one
awful
glare
at
her
sister
prudence
joined
in
this
gaiety
communicated
itself
to
the
others
and
soon
it
was
a
rollicking
group
around
the
parsonage
table
morgan
himself
smiled
uncertainly
he
was
puzzled
more
he
was
embarrassed
but
as
soon
as
carol
could
get
her
breath
she
gasped
out
an
explanation
you
were
just
right
morgan
to
give
thanks
for
the
table
there
nothing
on
it
to
be
thankful
for
and
the
whole
family
went
off
once
more
into
peals
of
laughter
morgan
had
very
little
appetite
that
day
he
did
not
seem
to
be
so
fond
of
sweet
corn
as
he
had
assured
prudence
he
talked
very
little
too
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
took
his
hat
and
walked
hurriedly
away
he
did
not
call
at
the
parsonage
again
oh
carol
said
prudence
reproachfully
wiping
her
eyes
how
could
you
start
us
all
off
like
that
for
the
table
for
the
table
shrieked
carol
and
prudence
joined
in
perforce
it
was
awful
she
gasped
but
it
was
funny
i
believe
even
father
would
have
laughed
a
few
weeks
after
this
carol
distinguished
herself
again
and
to
her
lasting
mortification
the
parsonage
pasture
had
been
rented
out
during
the
summer
months
before
the
change
of
ministers
the
outgoing
incumbent
having
kept
neither
horse
nor
cow
as
may
be
imagined
the
little
pasture
had
been
taxed
to
the
utmost
and
when
the
new
minister
arrived
he
found
that
his
field
afforded
poor
grazing
for
his
pretty
little
jersey
but
a
man
living
only
six
blocks
from
the
parsonage
had
generously
offered
starr
free
pasturage
in
his
broad
meadow
and
the
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
this
meant
that
every
evening
the
twins
must
walk
the
six
blocks
after
the
cow
and
every
morning
must
take
her
back
for
the
day
grazing
one
evening
as
they
were
starting
out
from
the
meadow
homeward
with
the
docile
animal
carol
stopped
and
gazed
at
blinkie
reflectively
lark
she
said
i
just
believe
to
my
soul
that
i
could
ride
this
cow
she
so
gentle
and
i
such
a
good
hand
at
sticking
on
carol
ejaculated
lark
think
how
it
would
look
for
a
parsonage
girl
to
go
down
the
street
riding
a
cow
but
there
no
one
to
see
protested
carol
and
this
was
true
for
the
parsonage
was
near
the
edge
of
town
and
the
girls
passed
only
five
houses
on
their
way
home
from
the
meadow
and
all
of
them
were
well
back
from
the
road
and
carol
was
as
she
had
claimed
a
good
hand
at
sticking
on
she
had
ridden
a
great
deal
while
they
were
at
exminster
a
neighbor
being
well
supplied
with
rideable
horses
and
she
was
passionately
fond
of
the
sport
to
be
sure
she
had
never
ridden
a
cow
but
she
was
sure
it
would
be
easy
lark
argued
and
pleaded
but
carol
was
firm
i
must
try
it
she
insisted
and
if
it
does
go
well
i
can
slide
off
you
can
lead
her
lark
the
obliging
lark
boosted
her
sister
up
and
carol
nimbly
scrambled
into
place
riding
astride
i
got
to
ride
this
way
she
said
cows
have
such
funny
backs
i
could
keep
on
any
other
way
if
i
see
any
one
coming
i
slide
for
it
for
a
while
all
went
well
lark
led
blinkie
carefully
gazing
about
anxiously
to
see
that
no
one
approached
carol
gained
confidence
as
they
proceeded
and
chatted
with
her
sister
nonchalantly
waving
her
hands
about
to
show
her
perfect
balance
and
lack
of
fear
so
they
advanced
to
within
two
blocks
of
the
parsonage
it
very
nice
said
carol
very
nice
indeed
but
her
backbone
is
rather
well
rather
penetrating
i
think
i
need
a
saddle
by
this
time
blinkie
concluded
that
she
was
being
imposed
upon
she
shook
her
head
violently
and
twitched
the
rope
from
lark
hand
for
lark
now
shared
her
sister
confidence
and
held
it
loosely
with
a
little
cry
she
tried
to
catch
the
end
of
it
but
blinkie
was
too
quick
for
her
she
gave
a
scornful
toss
of
her
dainty
head
and
struck
out
madly
for
home
with
great
presence
of
mind
carol
fell
flat
upon
the
cow
neck
and
hung
on
for
dear
life
while
lark
in
terror
started
out
in
pursuit
help
help
she
cried
loudly
papa
papa
papa
in
this
way
they
turned
in
at
the
parsonage
gate
which
happily
stood
open
otherwise
blinkie
would
undoubtedly
have
gone
through
or
over
as
luck
would
have
it
starr
was
standing
at
the
door
with
two
men
who
had
been
calling
on
him
and
hearing
lark
frantic
cries
they
rushed
to
meet
the
wild
procession
and
had
the
unique
experience
of
seeing
a
parsonage
girl
riding
flat
on
her
stomach
on
the
neck
of
a
galloping
jersey
with
another
parsonage
girl
in
mad
pursuit
blinkie
stopped
beside
the
barn
and
turned
her
head
about
inquiringly
carol
slid
to
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
at
sight
of
the
two
men
with
her
father
then
with
never
a
word
she
lit
out
for
the
house
at
top
speed
seeing
that
she
was
not
hurt
and
that
no
harm
had
been
done
the
three
men
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
burst
into
hearty
laughter
lark
came
upon
them
as
they
sat
thus
and
lark
was
angry
she
stamped
her
foot
with
a
violence
that
must
have
hurt
her
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
she
cried
passionately
it
was
awful
it
was
just
awful
carrie
might
have
been
killed
it
it
tell
us
all
about
it
lark
gasped
her
father
and
lark
did
so
smiling
a
little
herself
now
that
her
fears
were
relieved
poor
carol
she
said
she
never
live
down
the
humiliation
i
must
go
and
console
her
and
a
little
later
the
twins
were
weeping
on
each
other
shoulders
i
would
have
cared
sobbed
carol
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
in
the
world
but
the
presiding
elder
and
the
president
of
the
presbyterian
college
and
i
know
the
presbyterians
look
down
on
us
methodists
anyhow
though
they
would
admit
it
and
riding
a
cow
oh
larkie
if
you
love
me
go
and
get
me
the
carbolic
acid
so
i
can
die
and
be
out
of
disgrace
this
however
lark
stoutly
refused
to
do
and
in
a
little
while
carol
felt
much
better
but
she
talked
it
over
with
prudence
very
seriously
i
hope
you
understand
prudence
that
i
shall
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
blinkie
she
can
die
of
starvation
for
all
i
care
never
take
her
to
and
from
the
pasture
again
i
could
do
it
such
rank
ingratitude
as
that
cow
displayed
was
never
equaled
i
am
certain
i
suppose
you
quit
using
milk
and
cream
too
suggested
prudence
oh
well
said
carol
more
tolerantly
i
do
want
to
be
too
hard
on
blinkie
for
after
all
it
was
partly
my
own
fault
so
i
wo
go
that
far
but
i
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
hereafter
blinkie
and
i
meet
as
strangers
chapter
iii
the
ladies
aid
it
perfectly
disgusting
i
admit
father
said
prudence
sweetly
but
you
know
yourself
that
it
very
seldom
happens
and
i
am
sure
the
kitchen
is
perfectly
clean
and
the
soup
is
very
nice
indeed
if
it
is
canned
soup
twins
this
is
four
slices
of
bread
apiece
for
you
you
see
father
i
really
feel
that
this
is
a
crisis
in
the
life
of
the
parsonage
how
long
does
a
parsonage
usually
live
demanded
carol
it
would
live
long
if
the
ministers
had
many
twins
said
fairy
quickly
ouch
grinned
connie
plagiarizing
for
that
expressive
word
belonged
exclusively
to
the
twins
and
it
was
double
impertinence
to
apply
it
to
one
of
its
very
possessors
and
you
understand
do
you
father
that
if
everything
does
not
go
just
exactly
right
i
shall
feel
i
am
disgraced
for
life
i
know
the
ladies
disapprove
of
me
and
look
on
me
with
suspicion
i
know
they
think
it
wicked
and
ridiculous
to
leave
the
raising
of
four
bright
spirits
in
the
unworthy
hands
of
a
girl
like
me
i
know
they
will
all
sniff
and
smile
and
of
course
twins
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
feel
and
act
so
i
am
not
complaining
but
i
want
to
show
them
for
once
in
their
lives
that
the
parsonage
runs
smoothly
and
sweetly
if
you
would
just
stay
at
home
with
us
father
it
would
be
a
big
help
you
are
such
a
tower
of
strength
but
unfortunately
i
can
not
people
do
not
get
married
every
day
in
the
week
and
when
they
are
all
ready
for
it
they
do
not
allow
even
ladies
aids
to
stand
in
their
way
it
is
a
long
drive
ten
miles
at
least
and
i
must
start
at
once
and
it
will
likely
be
very
late
when
i
get
back
but
if
you
are
all
good
and
help
prudence
and
uphold
the
reputation
of
the
parsonage
i
will
divide
the
wedding
fee
with
you
share
and
share
alike
this
was
met
with
such
enthusiasm
that
he
added
hastily
but
wait
it
may
be
only
a
dollar
then
kissing
the
various
members
of
the
parsonage
family
he
went
out
the
back
door
barnward
now
said
prudence
briskly
i
want
to
make
a
bargain
with
you
girls
if
you
stay
clear
away
from
the
ladies
and
be
very
good
and
orderly
i
give
you
all
the
lemonade
and
cake
you
can
drink
afterward
oh
prudence
i
sure
i
ca
drink
much
cake
cried
carol
tragically
i
just
ca
imagine
myself
doing
it
i
mean
eat
the
cake
of
course
said
prudence
blushing
and
let
us
make
taffy
after
supper
wheedled
carol
prudence
hesitated
and
the
three
young
faces
hardened
then
prudence
relented
and
hastily
agreed
you
wo
need
to
appear
at
all
you
know
you
can
just
stay
outdoors
and
play
as
though
you
were
model
children
yes
said
carol
tartly
the
kind
the
members
used
to
have
which
are
all
grown
up
now
and
all
moved
out
of
mount
mark
too
carol
that
sounds
malicious
and
malice
is
tolerated
here
for
a
minute
now
oh
fairy
did
you
remember
to
dust
the
back
of
the
dresser
in
our
bedroom
mercy
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
the
back
of
the
dresser
dusted
for
do
you
expect
the
ladies
to
look
right
through
it
no
but
some
one
might
drop
something
behind
it
and
it
would
have
to
be
pulled
out
and
they
would
all
see
it
this
house
has
got
to
be
absolutely
spotless
for
once
i
am
sure
it
will
be
the
first
time
and
the
last
i
hope
added
carol
sepulchrally
we
have
an
hour
and
a
half
yet
continued
prudence
that
will
give
us
plenty
of
time
for
the
last
touches
twins
and
connie
you
better
go
right
out
in
the
field
and
play
i
call
you
a
little
before
two
and
then
you
must
go
quietly
upstairs
and
dress
just
wear
your
plain
little
ginghams
the
clean
ones
of
course
then
if
they
do
catch
a
glimpse
of
you
you
will
be
yes
you
can
take
some
bread
and
sugar
but
hurry
you
may
take
said
fairy
yes
of
course
may
take
is
what
i
now
hurry
then
prudence
and
fairy
set
to
work
again
in
good
earnest
the
house
was
already
well
cleaned
the
sandwiches
were
made
but
there
were
the
last
rites
and
every
detail
must
be
religiously
attended
to
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
three
main
rooms
of
the
parsonage
were
connected
by
double
doors
double
doors
you
understand
not
porti√®res
the
front
room
seldom
used
by
the
parsonage
family
opened
on
the
right
of
the
narrow
hallway
beyond
it
was
the
which
it
must
be
confessed
the
parsonage
girls
only
called
when
they
were
on
their
sunday
behavior
ordinarily
it
was
the
and
a
cheery
homey
attractive
place
it
was
with
a
great
bay
window
looking
out
upon
the
stately
mansion
of
the
averys
to
the
left
of
the
was
the
the
double
doors
between
them
were
always
open
the
other
pair
was
closed
except
on
occasions
of
importance
now
this
really
was
a
crisis
in
the
life
of
the
parsonage
family
if
not
of
the
parsonage
itself
the
girls
had
met
separately
every
member
of
the
ladies
aid
but
this
was
their
first
combined
movement
upon
the
parsonage
and
prudence
and
fairy
realized
that
much
depended
on
the
success
of
the
day
as
girls
the
whole
methodist
church
pronounced
the
young
starrs
charming
but
as
parsonage
people
well
they
were
obliged
to
reserve
judgment
and
as
for
prudence
having
entire
charge
of
the
household
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
every
individual
lady
looked
forward
to
this
meeting
with
eagerness
they
wanted
to
size
up
the
situation
they
were
coming
to
see
for
themselves
yes
it
was
undoubtedly
a
crisis
there
be
a
crowd
of
course
said
fairy
we
just
leave
the
doors
between
the
front
rooms
open
yes
but
we
close
the
doors
then
we
have
the
refreshments
all
out
on
the
table
and
when
we
are
ready
we
just
fling
back
the
doors
carelessly
and
there
you
are
so
the
table
was
prettily
decorated
with
flowers
and
great
plates
of
sandwiches
and
cake
were
placed
upon
it
in
the
center
was
an
enormous
borrowed
from
the
averys
full
of
lemonade
glasses
were
properly
arranged
on
the
trays
and
piles
of
nicely
napkins
were
scattered
here
and
there
the
girls
felt
that
the
was
a
credit
to
them
and
to
the
methodist
church
entire
from
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
house
they
hunted
out
chairs
and
stools
anticipating
a
real
run
upon
the
parsonage
nor
were
they
disappointed
the
twins
and
connie
were
not
even
arrayed
in
their
plain
little
ginghams
clean
before
the
first
arrivals
were
ushered
up
into
the
front
bedroom
ordinarily
occupied
by
prudence
and
fairy
there
adams
and
prentiss
and
began
connie
listening
intently
to
the
voices
in
the
next
room
yes
whispered
carol
peek
through
the
keyhole
lark
and
see
if
prentiss
is
looking
under
the
bed
for
dust
they
say
she
you
better
not
let
prudence
catch
you
repeating
there
stone
and
davis
and
they
say
davis
only
belongs
to
the
ladies
aid
for
the
sake
of
the
refreshments
and
carol
prudence
will
punish
you
well
i
do
believe
it
protested
carol
i
just
telling
you
what
i
heard
other
people
say
we
are
allowed
to
repeat
gossip
urged
lark
no
and
i
think
it
a
shame
too
for
it
awfully
funny
minnie
drake
told
me
that
miss
varne
joined
the
methodist
church
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
new
minister
was
a
widower
so
she
carol
carol
whirled
around
sharply
and
flushed
and
swallowed
hard
for
prudence
was
just
behind
her
i
i
i
but
she
could
get
no
further
upon
occasion
prudence
was
quite
terrible
so
i
heard
she
said
dryly
but
her
eyes
were
hard
now
run
and
out
to
the
field
or
to
the
barn
and
play
and
carol
be
sure
and
remind
me
of
that
speech
i
might
forget
it
the
girls
ran
quickly
out
carol
well
in
the
lead
no
wedding
fee
for
me
she
mumbled
bitterly
do
you
suppose
there
can
be
seven
devils
in
my
tongue
lark
like
there
are
in
the
bible
i
do
remember
there
being
seven
devils
in
the
bible
said
lark
oh
i
mean
the
the
possessed
people
it
tells
about
in
the
bible
crazy
i
suppose
it
means
somehow
i
just
ca
help
repeating
you
do
want
to
said
lark
not
without
sympathy
you
think
such
fun
you
know
well
anyhow
i
sure
i
wo
get
any
wedding
fee
it
seems
to
me
prudence
is
very
harsh
sometimes
you
can
appeal
to
father
if
you
like
not
on
your
life
said
carol
promptly
and
emphatically
he
worse
than
prudence
like
as
not
he
give
me
a
good
thrashing
into
the
bargain
no
i
strong
for
prudence
when
it
comes
to
punishment
in
preference
to
father
i
mean
i
ca
seem
to
be
fond
of
any
kind
of
punishment
from
anybody
for
a
while
carol
was
much
depressed
but
by
nature
she
was
a
buoyant
soul
and
her
spirits
were
presently
soaring
again
in
the
meantime
the
ladies
of
the
aid
society
continued
to
arrive
prudence
and
fairy
freshly
gowned
and
received
them
with
cordiality
and
many
merry
words
it
was
not
difficult
for
them
they
had
been
reared
in
the
hospitable
atmosphere
of
methodist
parsonages
where
if
you
have
but
two
dishes
of
oatmeal
the
outsider
is
welcome
to
one
that
is
carol
description
of
parsonage
life
but
prudence
was
concerned
to
observe
that
a
big
easy
chair
placed
well
back
in
a
secluded
corner
seemed
to
be
giving
dissatisfaction
it
was
adams
who
sat
there
first
she
squirmed
quite
a
little
and
seemed
to
be
gripping
the
arms
of
the
chair
with
unnecessary
fervor
presently
she
stammered
an
excuse
and
rising
went
into
the
other
room
after
that
miller
tried
the
corner
chair
and
soon
moved
away
then
jack
norey
and
beed
in
turn
sat
there
and
did
not
stay
prudence
was
quite
agonized
had
the
awful
twins
filled
it
with
needles
for
the
reception
of
the
poor
ladies
at
first
opportunity
she
hurried
into
the
secluded
corner
intent
upon
trying
the
chair
for
herself
she
sat
down
anxiously
then
she
gasped
and
clutched
frantically
at
the
arms
of
the
chair
for
she
discovered
at
once
to
her
dismay
that
the
chair
was
bottomless
and
that
only
by
hanging
on
for
her
life
could
she
keep
from
dropping
through
she
thought
hard
for
a
moment
but
thinking
did
not
interfere
with
her
grasp
on
the
and
then
she
realized
that
the
wisest
thing
would
be
to
discuss
it
publicly
anything
would
be
better
than
leaving
it
unexplained
for
the
ladies
to
comment
upon
privately
so
up
rose
prudence
conscientiously
pulling
after
her
the
thin
cushion
which
had
concealed
the
chair
shortcoming
look
fairy
she
cried
did
you
take
the
bottom
out
of
this
chair
it
must
have
been
horribly
uncomfortable
for
those
who
have
sat
there
however
did
it
happen
fairy
was
frankly
amazed
and
a
little
inclined
to
be
amused
ask
the
twins
she
said
tersely
i
know
nothing
about
it
at
that
moment
the
luckless
carol
went
running
through
the
hall
prudence
knew
it
was
she
without
seeing
because
she
had
a
peculiar
skipping
run
that
was
quite
characteristic
and
unmistakable
carol
she
called
and
carol
paused
carol
more
imperatively
then
carol
slowly
opened
the
door
she
was
a
parsonage
girl
and
rose
to
the
occasion
she
smiled
winsomely
carol
was
nearly
always
winsome
how
do
you
do
she
said
brightly
is
it
a
lovely
day
did
you
call
me
prudence
yes
do
you
know
where
the
bottom
of
that
chair
has
gone
why
no
prudence
gracious
that
chair
why
i
did
know
you
were
going
to
bring
that
chair
in
here
why
oh
i
am
so
sorry
why
in
the
world
did
you
tell
us
beforehand
some
of
the
ladies
smiled
others
lifted
their
brows
and
shoulders
in
a
mildly
suggestive
way
that
prudence
after
nineteen
years
in
the
parsonage
had
learned
to
know
and
dread
and
where
is
the
now
she
inquired
and
why
did
you
take
it
why
we
wanted
to
make
you
and
lark
well
yes
but
it
was
really
all
my
fault
you
know
we
wanted
to
make
a
seat
up
high
in
the
peach
tree
and
we
could
find
a
board
the
right
shape
so
she
discovered
i
mean
i
did
that
by
pulling
out
two
tiny
nails
we
could
get
the
bottom
off
the
chair
and
it
was
just
fine
it
a
perfectly
adorable
seat
brightening
but
sobering
again
as
she
realized
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
and
we
put
the
cushion
in
the
chair
so
that
it
would
be
noticed
we
never
use
that
chair
you
know
and
we
did
think
of
your
needing
it
we
put
it
away
back
in
the
cold
corner
of
the
sitting
er
where
no
one
ever
sits
i
so
sorry
about
it
carol
was
really
quite
crushed
but
true
to
her
parsonage
training
she
struggled
valiantly
and
presently
brought
forth
a
crumpled
and
sickly
smile
but
prudence
smiled
at
her
kindly
that
was
very
naughty
carol
she
said
frankly
it
true
that
we
seldom
use
that
chair
and
we
ought
to
have
looked
she
glanced
reproachfully
at
fairy
it
is
strange
that
in
dusting
it
fairy
but
never
mind
you
may
go
now
carol
it
is
all
right
then
she
apologized
gently
to
the
ladies
and
the
conversation
went
on
but
prudence
was
uncomfortably
conscious
of
keen
and
quizzical
eyes
turned
her
way
evidently
they
thought
she
was
too
lenient
well
it
was
very
naughty
she
thought
wretchedly
how
can
i
pretend
it
was
terribly
bad
when
i
feel
in
my
heart
that
it
was
before
long
the
meeting
was
called
to
order
and
the
secretary
instructed
to
read
the
minutes
oh
fluttered
miss
carr
excitedly
i
forgot
to
bring
the
book
i
have
been
secretary
very
long
you
know
only
six
months
interrupted
adams
tartly
how
do
you
expect
to
keep
minutes
demanded
the
president
oh
i
am
sure
miss
prudence
will
give
me
a
pencil
and
paper
and
copy
them
in
the
book
as
soon
as
ever
i
get
home
yes
indeed
said
prudence
there
is
a
tablet
on
that
table
beside
you
and
pencils
too
i
thought
we
might
need
them
then
the
president
made
a
few
remarks
but
while
she
talked
miss
carr
was
excitedly
opening
the
tablet
miss
carr
was
always
excited
and
always
fluttering
and
always
giggling
girlishly
carol
called
her
a
sweet
old
simpering
soul
and
so
she
was
but
now
right
in
the
midst
of
the
president
serious
remarks
she
quite
giggled
out
the
president
stared
at
her
in
amazement
the
ladies
looked
up
curiously
miss
carr
was
bending
low
over
the
tablet
and
laughing
gaily
to
herself
oh
this
is
very
cute
she
said
who
wrote
it
oh
it
is
just
real
cunning
fairy
sprang
up
suddenly
scarlet
oh
perhaps
you
have
one
of
the
twins
books
and
they
always
scribbling
and
no
it
is
yours
fairy
i
got
it
from
among
your
fairy
sank
back
intensely
mortified
and
miss
carr
chirped
brightly
oh
fairy
dear
did
you
write
this
little
poem
how
perfectly
sweet
and
what
a
queer
sentimental
little
creature
you
are
i
never
dreamed
you
were
so
romantic
may
i
read
it
aloud
fairy
was
speechless
but
the
ladies
including
the
president
were
impatiently
waiting
so
miss
carr
began
reading
in
a
sentimental
dreamy
voice
that
must
have
been
very
fetching
fifty
years
before
at
the
first
suggestion
of
poetry
prudence
sat
up
with
conscious
pride
fairy
was
so
clever
but
before
miss
carr
had
finished
the
second
verse
she
too
was
literally
drowned
in
humiliation
my
love
rode
out
of
the
glooming
night
into
the
glare
of
the
morning
light
my
love
rode
out
of
the
dim
unknown
into
my
heart
to
claim
his
own
my
love
rode
out
of
the
yesterday
into
the
now
and
he
came
to
stay
oh
love
that
is
rich
and
pure
and
true
the
love
in
my
heart
leaps
out
to
you
oh
love
at
last
you
have
found
your
part
to
come
and
dwell
in
my
empty
heart
miss
carr
sat
down
giggling
delightedly
and
the
younger
ladies
laughed
and
the
older
ladies
smiled
but
prentiss
turned
to
fairy
gravely
how
old
are
you
my
dear
and
with
a
effort
fairy
answered
sixteen
indeed
a
simple
word
but
so
suggestively
uttered
shall
we
continue
the
meeting
ladies
this
aroused
prudence
ire
on
her
sister
behalf
and
she
squared
her
shoulders
defiantly
for
a
while
fairy
was
utterly
subdued
but
thinking
it
over
to
herself
she
decided
that
after
all
there
was
nothing
absolutely
shameful
in
a
girl
writing
sentimental
verses
silly
to
be
sure
but
all
are
silly
we
love
them
for
it
and
fairy
good
nature
and
really
good
judgment
came
to
her
rescue
and
she
smiled
at
prudence
with
her
old
serenity
the
meeting
progressed
and
the
business
was
presently
disposed
of
so
far
things
were
not
too
seriously
bad
and
prudence
sighed
in
great
relief
then
the
ladies
took
out
their
sewing
and
began
industriously
working
at
many
unmentionable
articles
designed
for
the
intimate
clothing
of
a
lot
of
young
methodists
confined
in
an
orphans
home
in
chicago
and
they
talked
together
pleasantly
and
gaily
and
prudence
and
fairy
felt
that
the
cloud
was
lifted
but
soon
it
settled
again
dark
and
lowering
prudence
heard
lark
running
through
the
hall
and
her
soul
misgave
her
why
was
lark
going
upstairs
what
was
her
errand
and
she
remembered
the
wraps
of
the
ladies
alone
and
unprotected
dare
she
trust
lark
in
such
a
crisis
perhaps
the
very
sight
of
prudence
and
the
ladies
aid
would
arouse
her
better
nature
and
prevent
catastrophe
to
be
sure
her
mission
might
be
innocent
but
prudence
dared
not
run
the
risk
fortunately
she
was
sitting
near
the
door
lark
she
called
softly
lark
stopped
abruptly
and
something
fell
to
the
floor
lark
there
was
a
muttered
exclamation
from
without
and
lark
began
fumbling
rapidly
around
on
the
floor
talking
incoherently
to
herself
lark
the
ladies
smiled
and
miss
carr
laughing
lightly
said
she
is
an
attentive
creature
is
she
prudence
would
gladly
have
flown
out
into
the
hall
to
settle
this
matter
but
she
realized
that
she
was
on
exhibition
had
she
done
so
the
ladies
would
have
set
her
down
forever
after
as
thoroughly
incompetent
she
could
not
go
but
lark
must
come
to
her
lark
this
was
prudence
most
awful
voice
and
lark
was
bound
to
heed
oh
prue
she
said
plaintively
i
be
there
in
a
minute
you
wait
just
five
minutes
let
me
run
first
wo
you
then
i
come
gladly
wo
that
do
her
voice
was
hopeful
but
prudence
replied
with
dangerous
calm
come
at
once
lark
all
right
then
and
added
threateningly
but
you
wish
i
had
then
lark
opened
the
door
a
woeful
figure
in
one
hand
she
carried
an
empty
shoe
box
and
her
face
was
streaked
with
good
rich
iowa
mud
her
clothes
were
plastered
with
it
one
shoe
was
caked
from
the
sole
to
the
very
top
button
and
a
great
gash
in
her
stocking
revealed
a
generous
portion
of
round
white
leg
poor
prudence
at
that
moment
she
would
have
exchanged
the
whole
parsonage
bathroom
electric
lights
and
all
for
a
tiny
log
cabin
in
the
heart
of
a
great
forest
where
she
and
lark
might
be
alone
together
and
fairy
laughed
prudence
looked
at
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
then
turned
to
the
wretched
girl
what
have
you
been
doing
lark
the
expressed
in
the
face
of
lark
would
have
made
the
angels
weep
beneath
the
smudges
of
mud
on
her
cheeks
she
was
pallid
and
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
keep
her
chin
from
trembling
ominously
her
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
floor
for
the
most
part
but
occasionally
she
raised
them
hurriedly
appealingly
to
her
face
and
dropped
them
again
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
faced
the
ladies
prudence
was
obliged
to
repeat
her
question
before
lark
could
articulate
a
reply
she
gulped
painfully
a
few
times
making
meanwhile
a
desperate
effort
to
hide
the
gash
in
one
stocking
by
placing
the
other
across
it
rubbing
it
up
and
down
in
great
embarrassment
and
balancing
herself
with
apparent
difficulty
her
voice
when
she
was
able
to
speak
was
barely
recognizable
we
we
we
are
making
mud
images
prudence
it
it
was
awfully
messy
i
know
but
they
say
it
is
such
a
good
and
useful
thing
to
do
we
we
did
expect
the
the
ladies
to
see
us
mud
images
gasped
prudence
and
even
fairy
stared
incredulously
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
hold
of
an
idea
like
that
it
it
was
in
that
that
mother
home
friend
paper
you
take
prudence
prudence
blushed
guiltily
it
it
was
modeling
in
clay
but
we
have
any
clay
and
the
mud
is
very
nice
but
oh
i
know
i
look
just
horrible
i
i
connie
pushed
me
in
the
puddle
for
fun
i
i
was
vexed
about
it
prudence
honestly
i
i
was
chasing
her
and
i
fell
and
tore
my
stocking
and
and
but
prudence
the
papers
do
say
children
ought
to
model
and
we
did
think
of
getting
caught
another
appealing
glance
into
her
sister
face
and
lark
plunged
on
bent
on
smoothing
matters
if
she
could
carol
is
is
just
fine
at
it
really
she
she
making
a
venus
de
milo
and
it
good
but
we
ca
remember
whether
her
arm
is
off
at
the
elbow
or
below
the
shoulder
an
enormous
gulp
and
by
furious
blinking
lark
managed
to
crowd
back
the
tears
that
would
slip
to
the
edge
of
her
lashes
i
i
very
sorry
prudence
very
well
lark
you
may
go
i
do
not
really
object
to
your
modeling
in
mud
i
am
sure
i
am
sorry
you
look
so
disreputable
you
must
change
your
shoes
and
stockings
at
once
and
then
you
can
go
on
with
your
modeling
but
there
must
be
no
more
pushing
and
chasing
see
connie
about
that
now
oh
oh
oh
what
in
the
world
is
that
this
was
a
chorus
of
several
ladies
aid
voices
a
double
quartette
at
the
very
least
lark
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
and
began
looking
hurriedly
about
her
on
the
floor
it
got
in
here
just
as
i
expected
she
exclaimed
i
said
you
would
be
sorry
prue
oh
there
it
is
under
your
chair
prentiss
just
wait
maybe
i
can
shove
it
back
in
the
box
again
this
was
greeted
with
a
fresh
chorus
of
shrieks
there
was
a
hurried
and
absolute
vacation
of
that
corner
of
the
front
room
the
ladies
fled
dropping
their
cherished
sewing
shoving
one
another
in
a
most
way
and
there
beneath
a
chair
squatted
the
cause
of
the
confusion
an
innocent
unhappy
blinking
toad
oh
larkie
this
was
a
prolonged
wail
it
all
right
prue
honestly
it
is
urged
lark
with
pathetic
solemnity
we
did
do
it
for
a
joke
we
keeping
him
for
a
good
purpose
connie
found
him
in
the
garden
and
carol
said
we
ought
to
keep
him
for
professor
duke
he
asked
us
to
bring
him
things
to
cut
up
in
science
you
remember
so
we
just
shoved
him
into
this
shoe
box
and
we
thought
we
keep
him
in
the
until
morning
we
did
it
for
a
good
purpose
do
you
see
we
did
oh
prudence
prudence
was
horribly
outraged
but
even
in
that
critical
moment
justice
insisted
that
lark
arguments
were
sound
the
professor
had
certainly
asked
the
scholars
to
bring
him
things
to
cut
up
but
a
toad
a
live
one
and
the
ladies
aid
prudence
shivered
i
am
sure
you
meant
well
larkie
she
said
in
a
low
voice
striving
hard
to
keep
down
the
bitter
resentment
in
her
heart
i
know
you
did
but
you
should
not
have
brought
that
that
thing
into
the
house
pick
him
up
at
once
and
take
him
and
let
him
go
but
this
was
not
readily
done
in
spite
of
her
shame
and
deep
dismay
lark
refused
to
touch
the
toad
with
her
fingers
i
ca
touch
him
prudence
i
simply
ca
she
whimpered
we
shoved
him
in
with
the
broom
handle
before
and
as
no
one
else
was
willing
to
touch
it
and
as
the
ladies
clustered
together
in
confusion
and
with
much
laughter
in
the
far
corner
of
the
other
room
prudence
brought
the
broom
and
the
not
unwilling
toad
was
helped
to
other
quarters
now
go
said
prudence
quickly
and
lark
was
swift
to
avail
herself
of
the
permission
followed
a
quiet
hour
and
then
the
ladies
put
aside
their
sewing
and
walked
about
the
room
chatting
in
little
groups
with
a
significant
glance
to
fairy
prudence
walked
calmly
to
the
double
doors
between
the
and
the
the
eyes
of
the
ladies
followed
her
with
interest
and
even
enthusiasm
they
were
hungry
prudence
slowly
opened
wide
the
doors
and
stood
amazed
the
ladies
clustered
about
her
and
stood
amazed
also
the
was
there
and
the
table
but
the
appearance
of
the
place
was
vastly
different
the
snowy
cloth
was
draped
artistically
over
a
picture
on
the
wall
the
lowest
edges
well
above
the
floor
the
plates
and
trays
were
safely
stowed
away
on
the
floor
in
distant
corners
the
kitchen
scrub
bucket
had
been
brought
in
and
turned
upside
down
to
afford
a
fitting
resting
place
for
the
borrowed
punch
bowl
full
to
overflowing
with
fragrant
lemonade
and
at
the
table
were
three
dirty
disheveled
little
figures
bending
seriously
over
piles
of
mud
a
venus
de
milo
occupied
the
center
of
the
table
connie
was
painstakingly
at
work
on
some
animal
a
dog
perhaps
or
possibly
an
elephant
and
the
three
young
modelers
looked
up
in
exclamatory
consternation
as
the
doors
opened
oh
are
you
ready
cried
carol
how
the
time
has
flown
we
had
no
idea
you
be
ready
so
soon
oh
we
are
sorry
prudence
we
intended
to
have
everything
fixed
properly
for
you
again
we
needed
a
flat
place
for
our
modeling
it
a
shame
that
what
it
is
is
that
a
handsome
venus
i
did
that
if
you
just
shut
the
door
one
minute
prudence
we
have
everything
exactly
as
you
left
it
and
we
as
sorry
as
we
can
be
you
can
have
my
venus
for
a
centerpiece
if
you
like
illustration
if
you
just
shut
the
door
one
minute
prudence
we
have
everything
exactly
as
you
left
it
prudence
silently
closed
the
doors
and
the
ladies
laughing
significantly
drew
away
do
you
think
my
dear
began
prentiss
too
sweetly
that
they
are
a
little
more
than
you
can
manage
do
you
really
think
an
older
woman
is
needed
i
do
not
think
so
cried
fairy
before
her
sister
could
speak
no
older
woman
could
be
kinder
or
sweeter
or
more
patient
and
helpful
than
prue
undoubtedly
true
but
something
more
is
needed
i
am
afraid
it
appears
that
girls
are
a
little
more
disorderly
than
in
my
own
young
days
perhaps
i
do
not
judge
advisedly
but
it
seems
to
me
they
are
a
little
unmanageable
indeed
they
are
not
cried
prudence
loyally
they
are
young
lively
mischievous
i
know
and
i
am
glad
of
it
but
i
have
lived
with
them
ever
since
they
were
born
and
i
ought
to
know
them
they
are
unselfish
they
are
sympathetic
they
are
always
generous
they
do
foolish
and
irritating
things
but
never
things
that
are
hateful
and
mean
they
are
all
right
at
heart
and
that
is
all
that
counts
they
are
not
bad
girls
what
have
they
done
they
were
exasperating
and
humiliating
too
but
what
did
they
do
that
was
really
mean
they
embarrassed
and
mortified
me
but
not
intentionally
i
ca
punish
them
for
the
effect
on
me
you
know
would
that
be
just
or
fair
at
heart
they
meant
no
harm
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
were
many
serious
faces
among
the
ladies
some
cheeks
were
flushed
some
eyes
were
downcast
some
lips
were
compressed
and
some
were
trembling
every
mother
there
was
asking
in
her
heart
did
i
punish
my
children
just
for
the
effect
on
me
did
i
judge
my
children
by
what
was
in
their
hearts
or
just
by
the
trouble
they
made
me
and
the
silence
lasted
so
long
that
it
became
awkward
finally
prentiss
crossed
the
room
and
stood
by
prudence
side
she
laid
a
hand
tenderly
on
the
young
girl
arm
and
said
in
a
voice
that
was
slightly
tremulous
i
believe
you
are
right
my
dear
it
is
what
girls
are
at
heart
that
really
counts
i
believe
your
sisters
are
all
you
say
they
are
and
one
thing
i
am
very
sure
of
they
are
happy
girls
to
have
a
sister
so
patient
and
loving
and
just
not
all
real
mothers
have
as
much
to
their
credit
chapter
iv
a
secret
society
carol
and
lark
in
keeping
with
their
were
the
dearest
of
chums
and
comrades
they
resembled
each
other
closely
in
build
being
of
the
same
height
and
size
they
were
slender
yet
gave
a
suggestion
of
sturdiness
carol
face
was
a
delicately
tinted
oval
brightened
by
clear
and
sparkling
eyes
of
blue
she
was
really
beautiful
bright
attractive
and
vivacious
she
made
friends
readily
and
was
always
considered
the
most
popular
girl
in
our
crowd
whatever
carol
crowd
at
the
time
might
be
but
she
was
not
extremely
clever
caring
little
for
study
and
with
no
especial
talent
in
any
direction
lark
was
as
nearly
contrasting
as
any
sister
could
be
her
face
was
pale
her
eyes
were
dark
brown
and
full
of
shadows
and
she
was
a
brilliant
and
earnest
student
for
each
other
the
twins
felt
a
passionate
devotion
that
was
very
beautiful
but
ludicrous
as
well
to
them
the
great
rambling
barn
back
of
the
parsonage
was
a
most
delightful
place
it
had
a
big
on
one
side
and
horse
stalls
on
the
other
with
a
heavenly
haymow
over
all
and
with
chutes
for
the
descent
of
hay
and
twins
in
one
corner
was
a
high
dark
crib
for
corn
with
an
open
window
looking
down
into
the
horse
stalls
adjoining
when
the
crib
was
newly
filled
the
twins
could
clamber
painfully
up
on
the
corn
struggle
backward
through
the
narrow
window
and
holding
to
the
ledge
of
it
with
their
hands
drop
down
into
the
nearest
stall
to
be
sure
they
were
likely
to
fall
more
likely
than
not
and
their
hands
were
and
their
heads
most
of
the
time
but
splinters
and
bumps
did
not
interfere
with
their
pursuit
of
pleasure
now
the
twins
had
a
secret
society
of
which
they
were
the
founders
the
officers
and
the
membership
body
its
name
was
skull
and
crossbones
why
that
name
was
chosen
perhaps
even
the
twins
themselves
could
not
explain
but
it
sounded
deep
dark
and
bloody
and
so
was
the
society
lark
furnished
the
brain
power
for
the
organization
but
her
sister
was
an
enthusiastic
and
energetic
second
carol
club
name
was
lady
gwendolyn
and
lark
was
sir
alfred
angelcourt
ordinarily
although
subject
to
frequent
change
sometimes
she
was
lord
beveling
the
villain
of
the
plot
and
chased
poor
gwendolyn
madly
through
horse
stalls
and
haymow
again
she
was
the
indian
silently
stalking
his
unconscious
prey
then
she
was
a
fierce
lion
lying
in
wait
for
the
approaching
damsel
the
old
barn
saw
stirring
times
after
the
coming
of
the
new
parsonage
family
hark
hark
sounded
a
hissing
whisper
from
the
and
connie
eavesdropping
outside
the
barn
shivered
sympathetically
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
wailed
the
unfortunate
lady
look
look
run
for
your
life
then
while
connie
clutched
the
barn
door
in
a
frenzy
there
was
a
sound
of
rattling
corn
as
the
twins
scrambled
upward
a
silence
a
low
thud
and
an
unromantic
ouch
as
carol
bumped
her
head
and
stumbled
are
you
assaulted
shouted
the
bold
sir
alfred
and
connie
heard
a
wild
scuffle
as
he
rescued
his
companion
from
the
clutches
of
the
old
halter
on
which
she
had
stumbled
up
the
haymow
ladder
they
hurried
and
then
slid
recklessly
down
the
presently
the
barn
door
was
flung
open
and
the
society
knocked
connie
flying
backward
ran
madly
around
the
barn
a
few
times
and
scurried
under
the
fence
and
into
the
chicken
coop
a
little
later
connie
assailed
with
shots
of
corncobs
ran
bitterly
toward
the
house
peaking
was
strictly
forbidden
when
the
twins
were
engaged
in
skull
and
crossbones
activities
and
connie
soul
burned
with
desire
she
felt
that
this
secret
society
was
threatening
not
only
her
happiness
but
also
her
health
for
she
could
not
sleep
for
horrid
dreams
of
skulls
and
crossbones
at
night
and
could
not
eat
for
envying
the
twins
their
secret
and
mysterious
joys
therefore
with
unwonted
humility
she
applied
for
entrance
she
had
applied
many
times
previously
without
effect
but
this
time
she
enforced
her
application
with
a
nickel
worth
of
red
peppermint
drops
bought
for
the
very
purpose
the
twins
accepted
the
drops
gravely
and
told
connie
she
must
make
formal
application
then
they
marched
solemnly
off
to
the
barn
with
the
peppermint
drops
without
offering
connie
a
share
this
hurt
but
she
did
not
long
grieve
over
it
she
was
so
busy
wondering
what
on
earth
they
meant
by
formal
application
finally
she
applied
to
prudence
and
received
assistance
the
afternoon
mail
brought
to
the
parsonage
an
envelope
addressed
to
misses
carol
and
lark
starr
the
methodist
parsonage
mount
mark
iowa
and
in
the
lower
corner
was
a
suggestive
drawing
of
a
skull
and
crossbones
the
eyes
of
the
mischievous
twins
twinkled
with
delight
when
they
saw
it
and
they
carried
it
to
the
barn
for
prompt
perusal
it
read
as
follows
miss
constance
starr
humbly
and
respectfully
craves
admittance
into
the
ancient
and
honorable
organization
of
skull
and
crossbones
the
twins
pondered
long
on
a
fitting
reply
and
the
next
afternoon
the
postman
brought
a
letter
for
connie
waiting
impatiently
for
it
she
had
approached
the
twins
about
it
at
noon
that
day
did
you
get
my
application
she
had
whispered
nervously
but
the
twins
had
stared
her
out
of
countenance
and
connie
realized
that
she
had
committed
a
serious
breach
of
secret
society
etiquette
but
here
was
the
letter
her
fingers
trembled
as
she
opened
it
it
was
decorated
lavishly
with
skulls
and
crossbones
splashed
with
red
ink
supposedly
blood
and
written
in
the
same
suggestive
color
skull
and
crossbones
has
heard
the
plea
of
miss
constance
starr
if
she
present
herself
at
the
parsonage
haymow
this
evening
at
eight
she
shall
learn
the
will
of
the
society
regarding
her
petition
connie
was
jubilant
in
a
flash
she
saw
herself
admitted
to
the
mysterious
barnyard
order
and
began
working
out
a
name
for
her
own
designation
after
entrance
it
was
a
proud
day
for
her
by
the
time
the
twins
had
finished
washing
the
supper
dishes
it
was
dark
constance
glanced
out
of
the
window
apprehensively
she
now
remembered
that
eight
was
very
very
late
and
that
the
barn
was
a
long
way
from
the
house
and
up
in
the
haymow
too
and
such
a
mysterious
bloody
society
her
heart
quaked
within
her
so
she
approached
the
twins
respectfully
and
said
in
an
offhand
way
i
can
go
any
time
now
just
let
me
know
when
you
ready
and
go
right
along
with
you
but
the
twins
stared
at
her
again
in
an
amazing
and
overbearing
fashion
and
vouchsafed
no
reply
connie
however
determined
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
them
and
when
they
started
barnward
she
would
trail
closely
along
in
their
rear
it
was
a
quarter
to
eight
and
fearfully
dark
when
she
suddenly
remembered
that
they
had
been
an
unnaturally
long
time
she
rushed
up
in
a
panic
they
were
not
there
she
ran
through
the
house
they
were
not
to
be
found
the
dreadful
truth
overwhelmed
her
the
twins
were
already
in
the
haymow
the
hour
had
come
and
she
must
go
forth
breathlessly
she
slipped
out
of
the
back
door
and
closed
it
softly
behind
her
she
could
not
distinguish
the
dark
outlines
of
the
barn
in
the
equal
darkness
of
the
autumn
night
she
gave
a
long
sobbing
gasp
as
she
groped
her
way
forward
as
she
neared
the
barn
she
was
startled
to
hear
from
the
haymow
over
her
head
deep
groans
as
of
a
soul
in
mortal
agony
something
had
happened
to
the
twins
girls
girls
she
cried
forgetting
for
the
moment
her
own
sorry
state
what
is
the
matter
twins
sepulchral
silence
and
connie
knew
that
this
was
the
dreadful
skull
and
bones
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
stood
there
irresolute
in
the
intense
and
throbbing
darkness
it
only
the
twins
she
assured
herself
over
and
over
and
began
fumbling
with
the
latch
of
the
barn
door
but
her
fingers
were
stiff
and
cold
suddenly
from
directly
above
her
there
came
the
hideous
clanking
of
iron
chains
connie
had
read
ghost
stories
and
she
knew
the
significance
of
clanking
chains
but
she
stood
her
ground
in
spite
of
the
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
fly
after
the
clanking
the
loud
and
clamorous
peal
of
a
bell
rang
out
it
that
old
cow
bell
they
found
in
the
field
she
whispered
practically
but
found
it
none
the
less
horrifying
finally
she
stepped
into
the
blackness
of
the
barn
found
the
ladder
leading
to
the
haymow
and
began
slowly
climbing
but
her
own
weight
seemed
a
tremendous
thing
and
she
had
difficulty
in
raising
herself
from
step
to
step
she
comforted
herself
with
the
reflection
that
at
the
top
were
the
twins
company
and
triumph
hand
in
hand
but
when
she
reached
the
top
and
peered
around
her
she
found
little
comfort
and
no
desirable
company
a
small
barrel
draped
in
black
stood
in
the
center
of
the
mow
and
on
it
a
lighted
candle
gave
out
a
feeble
flickering
ray
which
emphasized
the
darkness
around
it
on
either
side
of
the
barrel
stood
a
motionless
figure
clothed
in
somber
black
on
the
head
of
one
was
a
skull
not
a
really
skull
just
a
pasteboard
imitation
but
it
was
just
as
awful
to
connie
on
the
head
of
the
other
were
crossbones
kneel
commanded
the
hoarse
voice
of
skull
in
which
connie
could
faintly
distinguish
the
tone
of
lark
she
knelt
an
abject
quivering
neophyte
hear
the
will
of
skull
and
crossbones
chanted
crossbones
in
a
shrill
monotone
then
skull
took
up
the
strain
once
more
skull
and
crossbones
great
in
mercy
and
in
condescension
has
listened
graciously
to
the
prayer
of
constance
the
seeker
hear
the
will
of
the
great
spirit
if
the
seeker
will
for
the
length
of
two
weeks
submit
herself
to
the
will
of
skull
and
crossbones
she
shall
be
admitted
into
the
ancient
and
honorable
order
if
the
seeker
accepts
this
condition
she
must
bow
herself
to
the
ground
three
times
in
token
of
submission
there
no
ground
here
came
a
small
faint
voice
from
the
kneeling
seeker
the
floor
madam
skull
explained
sternly
if
the
seeker
accepts
the
condition
to
submit
herself
absolutely
to
the
will
of
skull
and
crossbones
for
two
entire
weeks
she
shall
bow
herself
three
times
constance
hesitated
it
was
so
grandly
expressed
that
she
hardly
understood
what
they
wanted
carol
came
to
her
rescue
that
means
you
got
to
do
everything
lark
and
i
tell
you
for
two
weeks
she
said
in
her
natural
voice
then
constance
bowed
herself
three
times
although
she
lost
her
balance
in
the
act
and
carol
forgot
her
dignity
and
gave
way
to
laughter
swiftly
subdued
however
arise
and
approach
the
altar
she
commanded
in
the
shrill
voice
which
yet
gave
signs
of
laughter
constance
arose
and
approached
upon
the
altar
before
the
eternal
light
you
will
find
a
small
black
bow
with
a
drop
of
human
blood
in
the
center
this
is
the
badge
of
your
pledgedom
you
must
wear
it
day
and
night
during
the
entire
two
weeks
after
that
if
all
is
well
you
shall
be
received
into
full
membership
if
you
break
your
pledge
to
the
order
it
must
be
restored
at
once
to
skull
and
crossbones
take
it
and
pin
it
upon
your
breast
constance
did
so
and
her
breast
heaved
with
rapture
and
awe
in
mingling
then
a
horrible
thing
happened
the
flame
of
the
eternal
light
was
suddenly
extinguished
and
carol
exclaimed
the
ceremony
is
ended
return
damsel
to
thine
abode
a
sound
of
scampering
feet
and
constance
knew
that
the
grand
officials
had
fled
and
she
was
alone
in
the
dreadful
darkness
she
called
after
them
pitifully
but
she
heard
the
slam
of
the
kitchen
door
before
she
had
even
reached
the
ladder
it
was
a
sobbing
and
miserable
neophyte
who
stumbled
into
the
kitchen
a
few
seconds
later
the
twins
were
bending
earnestly
over
their
latin
grammars
by
the
side
of
the
kitchen
fire
and
did
not
raise
their
eyes
as
the
seeker
burst
into
the
room
constance
sat
down
and
gasped
and
quivered
for
a
while
then
she
looked
down
complacently
at
the
little
black
bow
with
its
smudge
of
red
ink
and
sighed
contentedly
the
week
that
followed
was
a
gala
one
for
the
twins
of
skull
and
crossbones
constance
swept
their
room
made
their
bed
washed
their
dishes
did
their
chores
and
in
every
way
behaved
as
a
model
pledge
of
the
ancient
and
honorable
the
twins
were
gracious
but
firm
there
was
no
arguing
and
no
faltering
it
is
the
will
of
skull
and
crossbones
that
the
damsel
do
this
they
would
say
and
the
damsel
did
it
prudence
did
not
feel
it
was
a
case
that
called
for
her
interference
so
she
sat
back
and
watched
while
the
twins
told
stories
read
and
frolicked
and
constance
did
their
daily
tasks
so
eight
days
passed
and
then
came
waterloo
constance
returned
home
after
an
errand
downtown
and
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
great
golden
pear
perhaps
constance
would
have
preferred
that
she
escape
the
notice
of
the
twins
on
this
occasion
but
as
luck
would
have
it
she
passed
carol
in
the
hall
gracious
what
a
pear
where
did
you
get
it
demanded
carol
covetously
i
met
arnold
and
he
bought
it
for
me
he
very
fond
of
me
it
cost
him
a
dime
too
for
just
this
one
is
it
a
beauty
and
connie
licked
her
lips
suggestively
carol
licked
hers
too
thoughtfully
then
she
called
up
the
stairs
lark
come
here
quick
lark
did
so
and
duly
exclaimed
and
admired
then
she
said
significantly
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
divide
with
us
of
course
said
connie
with
some
indignation
i
going
to
cut
it
in
five
pieces
so
prudence
and
fairy
can
have
some
too
a
pause
while
carol
and
lark
gazed
at
each
other
soberly
mentally
each
twin
was
figuring
how
big
her
share
would
be
when
the
pear
was
divided
in
fives
then
lark
spoke
it
is
the
will
of
skull
and
crossbones
that
this
luscious
fruit
be
turned
over
to
them
immediately
constance
faltered
held
it
out
drew
it
back
if
i
do
i
suppose
you
give
me
part
of
it
anyhow
she
said
and
her
eyes
glittered
not
so
damsel
said
carol
ominously
the
ancient
and
honorable
takes
it
never
gives
for
a
moment
constance
wavered
then
she
flamed
into
sudden
anger
i
wo
do
it
so
there
she
cried
i
think
you
mean
selfish
pigs
that
what
i
think
taking
my
very
own
pear
and
but
you
wo
get
it
i
do
care
if
i
never
get
into
your
silly
old
society
you
do
get
a
bite
of
this
pear
i
can
tell
you
that
and
constance
rushed
and
slammed
a
door
a
few
seconds
later
the
door
opened
again
and
her
cherished
badge
was
flung
down
upon
skull
and
crossbones
there
your
old
black
string
smeared
up
with
red
ink
she
yelled
at
them
wildly
and
again
the
door
slammed
carol
picked
up
the
insulted
badge
and
studied
it
thoughtfully
lark
spoke
first
it
occurs
to
me
fair
gwendolyn
that
we
would
do
well
to
keep
this
little
scene
from
the
ears
of
the
just
and
righteous
prudence
right
as
always
brave
knight
was
the
womanly
retort
and
the
twins
betook
themselves
to
the
haymow
in
thoughtful
mood
a
little
later
when
prudence
and
fairy
came
laughing
into
the
hall
a
constance
met
them
look
she
said
holding
out
a
pear
divided
into
three
parts
just
like
gaul
arnold
gave
me
this
pear
and
here
a
piece
for
each
of
you
the
girls
thanked
her
warmly
but
prudence
paused
with
her
third
almost
touching
her
lips
how
about
the
twins
she
inquired
are
they
at
home
wo
they
break
your
pledge
if
you
leave
them
out
constance
looked
up
sternly
i
offered
them
some
half
an
hour
ago
and
they
refused
it
she
said
and
they
have
already
put
me
out
of
the
society
there
was
tragedy
in
the
childish
face
and
prudence
put
her
arms
around
this
tell
prue
all
about
it
connie
she
said
but
constance
shook
her
head
it
ca
be
talked
about
go
on
and
eat
your
pear
it
is
good
was
it
all
right
questioned
prudence
did
the
twins
play
fair
connie
yes
said
constance
it
was
all
right
do
talk
about
it
but
in
two
days
constance
repented
of
her
rashness
in
three
days
she
was
pleading
for
forgiveness
and
in
four
days
she
was
starting
in
on
another
two
weeks
of
pledgedom
and
the
desecrated
ribbon
with
its
drop
of
blood
reposed
once
more
on
her
ambitious
breast
for
three
days
her
service
was
sore
indeed
for
the
twins
informed
her
with
sympathy
that
she
must
be
punished
for
insubordination
but
after
that
we
be
just
as
easy
on
you
as
anything
connie
they
told
her
so
do
you
get
sore
now
in
three
days
we
let
up
on
you
a
week
passed
ten
days
and
twelve
then
came
a
golden
october
afternoon
when
the
twins
sat
in
the
haymow
looking
out
upon
a
mellow
world
constance
was
in
the
yard
reading
a
fairy
story
the
situation
was
a
tense
one
for
the
twins
were
hungry
and
time
was
heavy
on
their
hands
the
apple
trees
in
avery
orchard
are
just
loaded
said
lark
aimlessly
and
there
are
lots
on
the
ground
too
i
saw
them
when
i
was
out
in
the
field
this
morning
some
of
the
trees
are
close
to
our
fence
too
said
carol
slowly
very
close
lark
glanced
up
with
sudden
interest
that
so
she
said
and
the
wires
on
the
fence
are
awfully
loose
carol
gazed
down
into
the
yard
where
constance
was
absorbed
in
her
book
constance
ought
to
read
as
much
as
she
does
she
argued
it
so
bad
for
the
eyes
yes
and
what
more
she
been
getting
off
too
easy
the
last
few
days
the
time
is
nearly
up
that
so
said
lark
let
call
her
up
here
this
was
done
at
once
and
the
unfortunate
constance
walked
reluctantly
toward
the
barn
her
fascinating
story
still
in
her
hand
you
see
they
got
more
apples
than
they
need
and
those
on
the
ground
are
just
going
to
waste
continued
carol
pending
the
arrival
of
the
little
pledge
the
chickens
are
pecking
at
them
and
ruining
them
it
criminal
destruction
that
what
it
is
declared
lark
connie
stood
before
them
respectfully
as
they
had
instructed
her
to
stand
the
twins
hesitated
each
secretly
hoping
the
other
would
voice
the
order
but
lark
as
usual
was
obliged
to
be
the
spokesman
damsel
she
said
it
is
the
will
of
skull
and
crossbones
that
you
hie
ye
to
yonder
orchard
avery
i
mean
and
bring
hither
some
of
the
golden
apples
basking
in
the
sun
what
ejaculated
connie
startled
out
of
her
respect
carol
frowned
connie
hastened
to
modify
her
tone
did
they
say
you
might
have
them
she
inquired
politely
that
concerns
thee
not
is
for
thee
only
to
render
obedience
to
the
orders
of
the
society
go
out
through
our
field
and
sneak
under
the
fence
where
the
wires
are
loose
and
hurry
back
we
awfully
hungry
the
trees
are
near
the
fence
there
is
any
danger
but
it
stealing
objected
connie
what
will
prudence
damsel
and
connie
turned
to
obey
with
despair
in
her
heart
bring
twelve
carol
called
after
her
that
be
four
apiece
and
hurry
connie
and
see
they
do
catch
you
while
you
about
it
after
she
had
gone
the
twins
lay
back
thoughtfully
on
the
hay
and
stared
at
the
cobwebby
roof
above
them
it
a
good
thing
prudence
and
fairy
are
downtown
said
lark
sagely
yes
or
we
catch
it
assented
carol
but
i
do
see
why
the
averys
have
too
many
apples
and
they
are
going
to
waste
i
sure
avery
would
rather
let
us
have
them
than
the
chickens
they
lay
in
silence
for
a
while
something
was
hurting
them
but
whether
it
was
their
fear
of
the
wrath
of
prudence
or
the
twinges
of
tender
consciences
who
can
say
she
an
unearthly
long
time
about
it
exclaimed
lark
at
last
do
you
suppose
they
caught
her
this
was
an
awful
thought
and
the
girls
were
temporarily
suffocated
but
they
heard
the
barn
door
swinging
beneath
them
and
sighed
with
relief
it
was
connie
she
climbed
the
ladder
skilfully
and
poured
her
golden
treasure
before
the
arch
thieves
skull
and
crossbones
there
were
eight
big
tempting
apples
hum
eight
said
carol
sternly
i
said
twelve
yes
but
i
was
afraid
some
one
was
coming
i
heard
such
a
noise
through
the
grapevines
so
i
got
what
i
could
and
ran
for
it
three
apiece
for
you
and
two
for
me
said
connie
sitting
down
sociably
beside
them
on
the
hay
but
carol
rose
damsel
begone
she
ordered
when
skull
and
crossbones
feast
thou
canst
not
yet
share
the
festive
board
rise
thee
and
speed
connie
rose
and
walked
soberly
toward
the
ladder
but
before
she
disappeared
she
fired
this
parting
shot
i
do
want
any
of
them
stolen
apples
do
taste
very
good
i
reckon
carol
and
lark
had
the
grace
to
flush
a
little
at
this
but
however
the
stolen
apples
tasted
the
twins
had
no
difficulty
in
disposing
of
them
then
full
almost
beyond
the
point
of
comfort
they
slid
down
the
went
out
the
back
way
climbed
over
the
chicken
coops
not
because
it
was
necessary
but
because
it
was
their
idea
of
amusement
and
went
for
a
walk
in
the
field
at
the
farthest
corner
of
the
field
they
crawled
under
the
fence
cut
through
a
neighboring
potato
patch
and
came
out
on
the
street
then
they
walked
respectably
down
the
sidewalk
turned
the
corner
and
came
quietly
in
through
the
front
door
of
the
parsonage
prudence
was
in
the
kitchen
preparing
the
evening
meal
fairy
was
in
the
busy
with
her
books
the
twins
set
the
table
conscientiously
filled
the
and
in
every
way
labored
irreproachably
but
prudence
had
no
word
of
praise
for
them
that
evening
she
hardly
seemed
to
know
they
were
about
the
place
she
went
about
her
work
with
a
pale
face
and
never
a
smile
to
be
seen
supper
was
nearly
ready
when
connie
sauntered
in
from
the
barn
after
leaving
the
haymow
she
had
found
a
cozy
corner
in
the
with
two
heavy
lap
robes
discarded
by
the
twins
in
their
flight
from
wolves
and
had
settled
down
there
to
finish
her
story
as
she
stepped
into
the
kitchen
prudence
turned
to
her
with
such
a
sorry
reproachful
gaze
that
connie
was
frightened
are
you
sick
prue
she
gasped
prudence
did
not
answer
she
went
to
the
door
and
called
fairy
finish
getting
supper
will
you
fairy
and
when
you
are
all
ready
you
and
the
twins
go
right
on
eating
do
wait
for
father
he
coming
home
until
evening
come
with
me
connie
i
want
to
talk
to
you
connie
followed
her
sister
soberly
and
the
twins
flashed
at
each
other
startled
and
questioning
looks
the
three
girls
were
at
the
table
when
prudence
came
into
the
alone
she
fixed
a
quietly
and
carried
it
off
then
she
came
back
and
sat
down
by
the
table
but
her
face
bore
marks
of
tears
and
she
had
no
appetite
the
twins
had
felt
small
liking
for
their
food
before
now
each
mouthful
seemed
to
choke
them
but
they
dared
not
ask
a
question
they
were
devoutly
thankful
when
fairy
finally
voiced
their
interest
what
is
the
matter
has
connie
been
in
mischief
it
worse
than
that
faltered
prudence
tears
rushing
to
her
eyes
again
why
prudence
what
in
the
world
has
she
done
i
may
as
well
tell
you
i
suppose
you
have
to
know
it
sooner
or
later
she
went
out
into
avery
orchard
and
stole
some
apples
this
afternoon
i
was
back
in
the
alley
seeing
if
mrs
moon
could
do
the
washing
and
i
saw
her
from
the
other
side
she
went
from
tree
to
tree
and
when
she
got
through
the
fence
she
ran
there
no
mistake
about
it
she
confessed
the
twins
looked
up
in
agony
but
prudence
face
reassured
them
constance
had
told
no
tales
i
have
told
her
she
must
spend
all
of
her
time
alone
for
a
week
taking
her
meals
there
too
she
will
go
to
school
of
course
but
that
is
all
i
want
her
to
see
the
awfulness
of
it
i
told
her
i
did
think
we
wanted
to
eat
with
a
thief
just
yet
i
said
we
must
get
used
to
the
idea
of
it
first
she
is
heartbroken
but
i
must
make
her
see
it
that
was
the
end
of
supper
no
one
attempted
to
eat
another
bite
after
the
older
girls
had
gone
into
the
carol
and
lark
went
about
their
work
with
stricken
faces
she
a
little
brick
not
to
tell
whispered
lark
i
going
to
give
her
that
pearl
pin
of
mine
she
always
liked
said
carol
in
a
hushed
voice
i
give
her
my
blue
ribbon
too
she
loves
blue
so
and
i
take
that
quarter
i
saved
and
buy
her
a
whole
quarter
worth
of
candy
but
that
night
when
the
twins
went
up
to
bed
they
were
doomed
to
disappointment
they
had
no
chance
of
making
it
up
with
constance
for
prudence
had
moved
her
small
bed
out
of
the
twins
room
and
had
placed
it
in
the
front
room
occupied
by
herself
and
fairy
they
asked
if
they
might
speak
to
constance
but
prudence
went
in
with
them
to
say
good
night
to
her
the
twins
broke
down
and
cried
as
they
saw
the
pitiful
little
figure
with
the
wan
and
face
they
threw
their
arms
around
her
passionately
and
kissed
her
many
times
but
they
went
to
bed
without
saying
anything
hours
later
lark
whispered
carol
are
you
asleep
no
i
ca
go
to
sleep
somehow
neither
can
i
do
you
think
we
better
tell
prudence
all
about
it
carol
squirmed
in
the
bed
i
suppose
we
had
she
said
reluctantly
but
it
be
lots
worse
for
us
than
for
connie
lark
added
so
much
older
and
we
made
her
do
it
yes
and
we
ate
all
the
apples
mourned
carol
maybe
we
better
just
let
it
go
suggested
lark
and
we
make
it
up
to
connie
afterwards
said
carol
now
you
be
careful
and
not
give
it
away
carol
you
see
that
you
do
but
it
was
a
sorry
night
for
the
twins
the
next
morning
they
set
off
to
school
with
no
chance
for
anything
but
a
brief
good
morning
with
connie
given
in
the
presence
of
prudence
down
the
parsonage
walk
carol
said
oh
wait
a
minute
lark
i
left
my
on
the
table
and
lark
walked
slowly
while
carol
went
rushing
back
she
found
prudence
in
the
kitchen
and
whispered
here
here
a
note
prudence
do
read
it
until
after
i
gone
to
school
at
ten
you
may
read
it
will
you
promise
prudence
laughed
a
little
but
she
promised
and
laid
the
note
carefully
away
to
wait
the
appointed
hour
for
its
perusal
as
the
clock
struck
ten
she
went
to
the
mantle
and
took
it
down
this
is
what
carol
had
written
oh
prudence
do
please
forgive
me
and
do
punish
connie
any
more
you
can
punish
me
any
way
you
like
and
i
be
glad
of
it
it
was
all
my
fault
i
made
her
go
and
get
the
apples
for
me
and
i
ate
them
connie
did
eat
one
of
them
she
said
stolen
apples
would
not
taste
very
good
it
was
all
my
fault
and
i
so
sorry
i
was
such
a
coward
i
did
dare
tell
you
last
night
will
you
forgive
me
but
you
must
punish
me
as
hard
as
ever
you
can
but
please
prudence
wo
you
punish
me
some
way
without
letting
lark
know
about
it
please
please
prudence
do
let
larkie
know
you
can
tell
papa
and
fairy
so
they
will
despise
me
but
keep
it
from
my
twin
if
you
love
me
prudence
do
let
larkie
know
as
prudence
read
this
her
face
grew
very
stern
carol
fault
and
she
was
ashamed
to
have
her
twin
know
of
her
disgrace
at
that
moment
prudence
heard
some
one
running
through
the
hall
and
thrust
the
note
hastily
into
her
dress
it
was
lark
and
she
flung
herself
wildly
upon
prudence
sobbing
bitterly
what
is
the
matter
lark
she
tried
really
frightened
are
you
sick
heartsick
that
all
wailed
lark
i
told
the
teacher
i
was
sick
so
i
could
come
home
but
i
not
oh
prudence
i
know
you
despise
and
abominate
me
all
the
rest
of
your
life
and
everybody
will
and
i
deserve
it
for
i
stole
those
apples
myself
that
is
i
made
connie
go
and
get
them
for
me
she
did
want
to
she
begged
not
to
but
i
made
her
she
did
eat
one
of
them
i
did
it
and
she
felt
very
badly
about
it
oh
prudence
you
can
do
anything
in
the
world
to
me
i
do
care
how
horrible
it
is
i
only
hope
you
will
but
prudence
you
wo
let
carol
know
will
you
oh
spare
me
that
prudence
please
that
my
last
request
that
you
keep
it
from
carol
prudence
was
surprised
and
puzzled
she
drew
the
note
from
her
pocket
and
gave
it
to
lark
carol
gave
me
that
before
she
went
to
school
she
explained
read
it
and
tell
me
what
you
are
driving
at
i
think
you
are
both
crazy
or
maybe
you
are
just
trying
to
shield
poor
connie
lark
read
carol
note
and
gasped
and
burst
out
laughing
the
shame
and
bitter
weeping
and
nervousness
had
rendered
her
hysterical
and
now
she
laughed
and
cried
until
prudence
was
alarmed
again
in
time
however
lark
was
able
to
explain
we
both
did
it
she
gasped
the
skull
and
crossbones
and
we
both
told
the
truth
about
it
we
made
her
go
and
get
them
for
us
and
we
ate
them
and
she
did
want
to
go
i
advised
carol
not
to
tell
and
she
advised
me
not
to
all
the
way
to
school
this
morning
we
kept
advising
each
other
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
but
i
intended
all
the
time
to
pretend
i
was
sick
so
i
could
come
and
confess
alone
i
wanted
to
take
the
punishment
for
both
of
us
so
carol
could
get
out
i
guess
that
what
she
thought
too
bless
her
little
old
heart
as
if
i
let
her
he
punished
for
my
fault
and
it
was
mostly
my
fault
too
prue
for
i
mentioned
the
apples
first
of
all
prudence
laughed
it
was
really
ludicrous
but
when
she
thought
of
loyal
little
connie
sobbing
all
through
the
long
night
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
again
she
went
quickly
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
school
building
next
door
to
the
parsonage
may
i
speak
to
constance
starr
mr
imes
she
asked
it
is
very
important
this
is
prudence
her
sister
and
when
connie
came
to
the
telephone
she
cried
oh
you
blessed
little
child
why
did
you
tell
me
will
you
forgive
me
connie
i
ought
to
have
made
you
tell
me
all
about
it
but
i
was
so
sorry
i
could
bear
to
talk
much
about
it
the
twins
have
told
me
you
a
dear
sweet
good
little
darling
that
what
you
are
oh
prudence
that
was
all
connie
said
but
something
in
her
voice
made
prudence
hang
up
the
receiver
quickly
and
cry
bitterly
that
noon
prudence
pronounced
judgment
on
the
sinners
but
her
eyes
twinkled
for
carol
and
lark
had
scolded
each
other
roundly
for
giving
things
away
connie
should
have
refused
to
obey
you
she
said
gently
holding
connie
in
her
arms
she
knew
it
was
wrong
but
she
has
been
punished
more
than
enough
but
you
twins
in
the
first
place
i
right
now
abolish
the
skull
and
crossbones
forever
and
ever
and
you
can
not
play
in
the
barn
again
for
a
month
and
you
must
go
over
to
the
averys
this
afternoon
and
tell
them
about
it
and
pay
for
the
apples
and
you
must
send
all
of
your
spending
money
for
the
next
month
to
that
woman
who
is
gathering
up
things
for
the
bad
little
children
in
the
reform
school
that
will
help
you
remember
what
happens
to
boys
and
girls
who
get
in
the
habit
of
taking
things
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
twins
accepted
all
of
this
graciously
except
that
which
referred
to
confessing
their
sin
to
their
neighbors
that
did
hurt
the
twins
were
so
superior
and
admirable
they
could
bear
to
ruin
their
reputations
but
prudence
stood
firm
in
spite
of
their
weeping
and
wailing
and
that
afternoon
two
shamefaced
sorry
girls
crept
meekly
in
at
the
averys
door
to
make
their
peace
but
about
the
skull
and
crossbones
it
mostly
punishment
for
me
prue
said
connie
regretfully
for
the
twins
have
been
in
it
ever
since
we
came
to
mount
mark
and
i
never
got
in
at
all
and
i
wanted
them
to
call
me
lady
magdalina
featheringale
and
connie
sighed
chapter
v
the
twins
stick
up
for
the
bible
prudence
had
been
calling
on
a
sick
member
whenever
circumstances
permitted
she
gladly
served
as
pastoral
assistant
for
her
father
but
she
always
felt
that
raising
the
family
was
her
one
big
job
and
nothing
was
allowed
to
take
precedence
of
it
as
she
walked
that
afternoon
down
maple
street
seemingly
because
it
was
bordered
with
grand
old
elms
she
felt
at
peace
with
all
the
world
the
very
sunshine
beaming
down
upon
her
through
the
huge
skeletons
of
the
leafless
elms
was
not
more
than
the
daughter
of
the
parsonage
parsonage
life
had
been
running
smoothly
for
as
much
as
ten
days
past
and
prudence
in
view
of
that
ten
days
immunity
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
twins
if
not
connie
also
were
practically
reared
mount
mark
is
a
dear
old
place
a
duck
of
a
place
as
the
twins
would
say
and
i
quite
sorry
there
a
limit
for
methodist
preachers
i
should
truly
like
to
live
right
here
until
i
am
old
and
dead
then
she
paused
and
bowed
and
smiled
she
did
not
recognize
the
young
woman
approaching
but
she
remembered
just
in
time
that
parsonage
people
are
marked
characters
so
she
greeted
the
stranger
cordially
you
are
miss
starr
are
you
the
woman
was
saying
i
am
miss
allen
the
principal
of
the
high
school
you
know
oh
yes
cried
prudence
thrusting
forth
her
hand
impulsively
oh
yes
i
know
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
miss
allen
was
a
young
woman
of
with
clear
kind
eyes
and
a
strong
sweet
mouth
she
had
about
her
that
charm
of
manner
which
can
only
be
described
as
winsome
womanliness
prudence
gazed
at
her
with
open
and
honest
admiration
such
a
young
woman
to
be
the
principal
of
a
high
school
in
a
city
the
size
of
mount
mark
she
must
be
tremendously
clever
but
prudence
did
not
sigh
we
ca
all
be
clever
you
know
there
must
be
some
of
us
to
admire
the
rest
of
us
the
two
walked
along
together
chatting
sociably
on
subjects
that
meant
nothing
to
either
of
them
presently
miss
allen
stopped
and
with
a
graceful
wave
of
her
hand
said
lightly
this
is
where
i
am
rooming
are
you
in
a
very
great
hurry
this
afternoon
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
twins
will
you
come
in
the
spirits
of
prudence
fell
earthward
with
a
clatter
the
twins
whatever
had
they
been
doing
now
she
followed
miss
allen
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
with
the
joy
quite
quenched
in
her
heart
she
did
not
notice
the
dainty
room
into
which
she
was
conducted
she
ignored
the
offered
chair
and
with
a
dismal
face
turned
toward
miss
allen
oh
please
what
have
they
been
doing
is
it
very
awful
miss
allen
laughed
gaily
oh
sit
down
and
do
look
so
distressed
it
nothing
at
all
they
have
been
doing
anything
i
just
want
to
discuss
them
on
general
principles
you
know
it
my
duty
to
confer
with
the
parents
and
guardians
of
my
scholars
immensely
relieved
prudence
sank
down
in
the
chair
and
rocked
comfortably
to
and
fro
a
few
times
general
principles
ah
blessed
words
i
suppose
you
know
that
carol
is
quite
the
idol
of
the
high
school
already
she
is
the
adored
one
of
the
place
you
see
she
is
not
mixed
up
in
any
scholastic
rivalry
lark
is
one
of
the
very
best
in
her
class
and
there
is
intense
rivalry
between
a
few
of
the
freshmen
but
carol
is
out
of
all
that
and
every
one
is
free
to
worship
at
her
shrine
she
makes
no
pretensions
to
stand
first
is
she
very
stupid
prudence
was
disappointed
she
did
so
want
both
of
her
twins
to
shine
stupid
not
a
bit
of
it
she
is
a
very
good
scholar
much
better
than
the
average
our
first
pupils
including
lark
average
around
and
seven
then
there
are
others
ranging
between
ninety
and
carol
is
one
of
them
the
fairly
good
ones
are
over
and
the
fairly
bad
ones
are
over
and
the
hopeless
ones
are
below
that
this
is
a
rough
way
of
showing
how
they
stand
lark
is
a
very
fine
scholar
really
the
best
in
the
class
she
not
only
makes
good
grades
she
grasps
the
underlying
significance
of
her
studies
very
few
freshmen
even
among
the
best
do
that
she
is
quite
exceptional
we
hope
to
make
something
very
big
and
fine
of
larkie
prudence
eyes
shone
with
motherly
pride
she
nodded
striving
to
make
her
voice
natural
and
as
she
answered
yes
she
is
bright
she
certainly
is
carol
is
quite
different
but
she
is
so
and
vivacious
and
if
you
know
what
that
means
that
every
one
in
high
school
and
even
the
children
idolize
her
she
is
very
witty
but
her
wit
is
always
innocent
and
kind
she
never
hurts
any
one
feelings
and
she
is
never
impertinent
the
professors
are
as
crazy
about
her
as
the
scholars
forgive
the
slang
did
the
twins
ever
tell
you
what
happened
the
first
day
of
school
no
tell
me
prudence
was
clearly
very
anxious
i
shall
never
forget
it
the
freshmen
were
sent
into
the
recitation
room
to
confer
with
professor
duke
about
etc
carol
was
one
of
the
first
in
the
line
as
they
came
out
she
sat
down
in
her
seat
in
the
first
aisle
with
one
foot
out
at
the
side
one
of
the
boys
tripped
over
it
said
miss
adams
gently
forgot
yourself
did
you
and
carol
eyes
twinkled
as
she
said
no
miss
adams
if
i
had
i
still
be
in
the
recitation
room
miss
allen
laughed
but
prudence
eyes
were
agonized
how
hateful
of
her
do
the
twins
tell
you
little
things
that
happen
at
school
like
that
for
instance
never
i
supposed
they
were
perfectly
all
right
well
here
another
twice
a
week
we
have
talks
on
first
aid
to
the
injured
professor
duke
conducts
them
one
day
he
asked
carol
what
she
would
do
if
she
had
a
very
severe
cold
and
carol
said
soak
my
feet
in
hot
water
and
go
to
bed
my
sister
makes
me
miss
allen
laughed
again
but
prudence
was
speechless
sometimes
we
have
talks
on
normal
work
practical
informal
discussions
many
of
our
scholars
will
be
country
you
know
miss
adams
conducts
these
normal
hours
one
day
she
asked
carol
what
she
would
do
if
she
had
applied
for
a
school
and
was
asked
by
the
directors
to
write
a
thesis
on
student
discipline
that
they
might
judge
of
her
and
her
ability
by
it
carol
said
get
lark
to
write
it
for
me
even
prudence
laughed
a
little
at
this
but
she
said
why
do
you
scold
her
we
talked
it
all
over
shortly
after
she
entered
school
miss
adams
did
not
understand
carol
at
first
and
thought
she
was
a
little
impertinent
but
professor
duke
and
i
stood
firm
against
even
mentioning
it
to
her
she
is
perfectly
about
it
you
know
of
course
miss
starr
that
we
really
try
to
make
individuals
of
our
scholars
so
many
many
hundreds
are
turned
out
of
the
public
schools
all
cut
on
one
pattern
we
do
not
like
it
we
fight
against
it
carol
is
different
from
others
by
nature
and
we
going
to
keep
her
different
if
possible
if
we
crush
her
individuality
she
will
come
out
just
like
thousands
of
others
all
one
pattern
miss
adams
is
as
fond
of
carol
now
as
any
one
of
us
you
understand
that
we
could
not
let
impudence
or
impertinence
pass
unreproved
but
carol
is
never
guilty
of
that
she
is
always
respectful
and
courteous
but
she
is
spontaneous
and
and
we
are
glad
of
it
do
you
know
what
the
scholars
call
professor
duke
professor
duck
said
prudence
humbly
but
they
mean
it
for
a
compliment
they
really
admire
and
like
him
very
much
i
hope
he
does
not
know
what
they
call
him
he
does
one
day
he
was
talking
about
the
nobility
system
in
england
he
explained
the
difference
between
dukes
and
earls
and
lords
and
told
them
who
is
to
be
addressed
as
your
majesty
your
highness
your
grace
and
so
on
then
he
said
carol
if
i
was
the
eldest
son
what
would
you
call
me
and
carol
said
still
call
you
a
duck
professor
it
would
make
any
difference
to
me
prudence
could
only
sigh
one
other
time
he
was
illustrating
phenomena
he
explained
the
idea
and
tried
to
get
one
of
the
boys
to
mention
the
word
phenomenon
you
know
the
boy
could
think
of
it
professor
gave
three
or
four
illustrations
and
still
the
boy
could
remember
it
come
now
professor
said
finally
unusual
something
very
much
out
of
the
ordinary
suppose
you
should
see
a
blackbird
running
a
race
down
the
street
with
a
sparrow
what
would
you
call
it
the
boy
imagine
and
professor
said
would
you
call
that
carol
carol
said
bad
dream
prudence
smiled
wearily
sometimes
we
have
discussions
of
moral
points
we
take
turns
about
conducting
them
and
try
to
stimulate
their
interest
in
such
things
we
want
to
make
them
think
every
one
for
himself
one
day
professor
duke
said
a
boy
in
this
town
has
a
grudge
against
you
unjust
and
unfair
you
have
tried
one
thing
after
another
to
change
his
attitude
but
he
continues
to
annoy
and
inconvenience
and
even
hurt
you
on
every
occasion
remember
that
you
have
tried
every
ordinary
way
of
winning
his
good
will
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
as
a
last
resort
carol
said
tell
papa
on
him
miss
allen
laughed
again
heartily
it
does
have
a
disturbing
effect
on
the
class
i
admit
and
often
spoils
a
good
point
but
professor
duke
calls
on
carol
every
time
he
sees
her
eyes
twinkle
he
does
it
on
purpose
and
miss
adams
is
nearly
as
bad
as
he
one
day
she
said
you
have
unintentionally
done
something
to
greatly
irritate
and
inconvenience
a
prominent
man
in
town
he
knows
you
did
it
and
he
is
very
angry
he
is
a
man
of
sharp
temper
and
disagreeable
manners
you
know
that
he
will
be
extremely
unpleasant
and
insulting
if
you
go
to
him
with
explanations
and
apologies
what
are
you
going
to
do
think
i
just
keep
out
of
his
way
for
a
few
weeks
said
carol
soberly
i
hope
she
does
talk
like
that
to
you
miss
allen
instantly
miss
allen
was
grave
no
she
does
not
i
am
so
sorry
leaning
forward
suddenly
she
said
miss
starr
why
do
the
twins
dislike
me
dislike
you
echoed
prudence
why
they
do
not
dislike
you
what
in
the
world
makes
you
think
oh
yes
indeed
they
do
both
of
them
now
why
people
generally
like
me
i
have
always
been
popular
with
my
students
this
is
my
second
year
here
last
year
the
whole
high
school
stood
by
me
as
one
man
this
year
the
freshmen
started
as
usual
after
one
week
the
twins
changed
i
knew
it
instantly
then
other
freshmen
changed
now
the
whole
class
comes
as
near
snubbing
me
as
they
dare
do
you
mean
to
say
they
have
never
told
you
about
it
indeed
they
have
not
and
i
am
sure
you
are
mistaken
they
do
like
you
they
like
everybody
christian
tolerance
perhaps
smiled
miss
allen
ruefully
but
i
want
them
to
like
me
personally
and
intimately
i
can
help
the
twins
i
can
do
them
good
i
know
i
can
but
they
wo
let
me
they
keep
me
at
arm
length
they
are
both
dear
and
i
love
them
but
they
freeze
me
to
death
why
i
ca
believe
it
but
it
is
true
do
they
talk
of
their
professors
at
home
at
all
oh
often
what
do
they
say
of
us
why
they
say
miss
adams
is
a
perfectly
sweet
old
lamb
they
do
not
mean
to
be
disrespectful
and
they
say
professor
duke
is
the
dearest
duck
they
almost
swear
by
duck
and
what
do
they
say
of
me
prudence
hesitated
thinking
hard
come
now
what
do
they
say
we
must
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
why
they
have
said
that
you
are
very
pretty
and
most
unbelievably
smart
oh
quite
a
difference
between
sweet
old
lamb
and
the
dearest
duck
and
being
very
pretty
and
smart
do
you
see
it
yes
confessed
prudence
reluctantly
but
i
had
thought
of
it
before
now
what
is
wrong
what
have
i
done
why
look
here
the
twins
think
everything
of
professor
duke
and
i
am
sure
carol
deliberately
neglects
her
science
lessons
in
order
to
be
kept
in
after
school
by
him
but
though
she
hates
mathematics
my
subject
she
works
at
it
desperately
so
i
ca
keep
her
in
she
sits
on
duke
table
and
chats
with
him
by
the
hour
but
she
passes
me
up
with
a
curt
night
miss
allen
and
larkie
too
lark
is
worse
than
carol
her
dislike
is
i
believe
i
could
win
carol
in
time
sometimes
i
waylay
her
when
she
is
leaving
after
school
and
try
my
best
but
just
as
she
begins
to
thaw
lark
invariably
comes
up
to
see
if
she
is
ready
to
go
home
and
she
looks
at
both
of
us
with
superior
icy
eyes
and
carol
freezes
in
a
second
ordinarily
she
looks
at
me
with
a
sort
of
sympathetic
pity
and
wonder
but
lark
is
always
haughty
and
nearly
contemptuous
it
is
different
with
the
rest
of
the
class
it
is
nothing
important
to
them
the
twins
are
popular
in
the
class
you
know
and
the
others
realizing
that
they
dislike
me
hold
aloof
on
their
account
i
ca
fathom
it
said
prudence
now
professor
duke
is
very
brilliant
and
clever
and
interesting
and
he
does
like
carol
tremendously
larkie
too
he
says
she
is
the
cleverest
girl
he
ever
knew
but
carol
is
his
favorite
but
he
does
not
like
teaching
and
he
has
not
the
real
interests
of
the
scholars
at
heart
next
year
he
is
to
begin
some
very
wonderful
research
work
at
a
big
salary
that
is
what
he
loves
that
is
where
his
interests
lie
but
this
year
being
idle
and
his
uncle
being
on
the
school
board
here
he
accepted
this
place
as
a
sort
of
vacation
in
the
meanwhile
that
is
all
it
means
to
him
but
i
love
teaching
it
is
my
i
love
the
young
people
and
i
want
to
help
them
why
wo
the
twins
give
me
a
chance
surely
i
am
as
attractive
as
professor
duke
they
are
even
fond
of
miss
adams
whom
most
people
consider
rather
a
sour
old
maid
but
they
have
no
use
for
me
i
want
you
to
find
out
the
reason
and
tell
me
will
you
do
it
they
will
tell
you
if
you
ask
them
wo
they
i
think
so
it
is
partly
my
fault
i
am
very
strict
with
them
about
saying
hateful
things
about
people
i
do
not
allow
it
and
i
insist
that
they
like
everybody
if
they
do
i
make
them
so
they
have
just
kept
it
to
themselves
but
i
will
do
my
best
one
would
have
thought
that
prudence
carried
the
responsibility
for
the
entire
system
of
the
united
states
upon
her
shoulders
that
night
so
anxious
were
her
eyes
so
grave
her
face
supper
over
she
quietly
suggested
to
fairy
that
she
would
appreciate
the
absence
of
herself
and
connie
for
a
time
and
fairy
instantly
realized
that
the
twins
must
be
dealt
with
seriously
for
something
so
she
went
in
search
of
connie
and
the
two
set
out
for
a
long
walk
then
prudence
went
to
the
kitchen
where
the
twins
were
washing
the
dishes
and
as
usual
laughing
immoderately
over
something
prudence
sat
down
and
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
chin
in
her
palms
i
met
miss
allen
she
said
closely
observing
the
faces
of
the
twins
a
significant
glance
flashed
between
them
and
they
stiffened
instantly
she
very
pretty
and
sweet
is
she
continued
prudence
yes
very
agreed
lark
without
any
enthusiasm
such
pretty
hair
added
carol
dispassionately
she
must
be
very
popular
with
the
scholars
suggested
prudence
yes
most
of
them
are
fond
of
her
assented
lark
she
has
rather
winsome
manners
i
think
said
carol
which
of
your
professors
do
you
like
best
queried
prudence
duck
they
answered
unanimously
and
with
brightening
faces
why
because
he
is
a
duck
said
carol
and
they
all
laughed
but
prudence
returned
to
the
charge
without
delay
do
you
like
miss
allen
she
was
going
through
these
questions
with
such
solemnity
that
the
twins
suspicions
had
been
aroused
right
at
the
start
what
had
miss
allen
told
their
sister
again
that
significant
flash
from
twin
to
twin
she
certainly
has
very
likeable
ways
said
lark
shrewdly
but
do
you
like
her
insisted
prudence
i
would
like
her
very
much
under
ordinary
circumstances
admitted
carol
what
is
unusual
about
the
circumstances
prudence
wanted
to
know
look
here
prudence
what
did
miss
allen
tell
you
was
she
complaining
about
us
we
been
very
nice
and
orderly
i
sure
lark
was
aggrieved
she
was
complaining
she
likes
you
both
but
she
says
you
do
not
like
her
i
want
to
know
why
well
if
you
must
know
miss
allen
is
a
heretic
snapped
lark
then
prudence
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
gazed
at
the
flushed
faces
of
the
twins
for
two
full
minutes
a
a
a
what
she
ejaculated
when
power
of
speech
returned
to
her
heretic
said
carol
with
some
relish
a
heretic
you
know
what
heresy
is
do
you
we
tell
you
all
about
it
if
you
like
now
you
got
things
started
we
did
tell
you
before
because
we
thought
you
and
father
would
feel
badly
about
sending
us
to
school
to
a
heretic
but
do
you
worry
miss
allen
has
influenced
us
any
we
have
given
her
a
chance
said
carol
with
her
impish
smile
go
on
begged
prudence
tell
me
you
both
crazy
i
see
that
but
tell
me
well
began
lark
for
carol
always
relegated
the
to
her
more
gifted
twin
we
suspected
miss
allen
right
from
the
start
they
used
to
have
bible
reading
every
morning
in
school
one
chapter
you
know
and
then
the
lord
prayer
after
the
first
week
miss
allen
dropped
it
we
thought
that
was
a
a
suspicious
circumstance
phenomenally
so
said
carol
darkly
but
we
kept
our
suspicions
to
ourselves
and
we
did
come
across
anything
else
for
several
days
we
would
condemn
anybody
on
on
circumstantial
evidence
prue
we
very
you
know
in
spite
of
being
twins
added
carol
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
prudence
inquired
frowning
at
carol
oh
nothing
admitted
carol
driven
into
a
corner
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
emphatic
go
on
lark
well
there
a
girl
at
school
named
hattie
simpson
you
do
not
know
her
prue
we
do
associate
with
her
oh
yes
we
like
her
very
well
but
she
is
parsonage
material
she
a
goat
put
in
carol
you
need
frown
prue
that
bible
do
you
remember
the
sheep
and
the
goats
i
do
know
now
just
what
it
was
they
did
but
i
know
the
goats
were
very
very
disreputable
characters
go
on
lark
well
her
folks
are
atheists
and
she
an
atheist
too
you
know
what
an
atheist
is
do
you
you
know
prue
mount
mark
is
a
very
religious
town
on
account
of
the
presbyterian
college
and
all
and
it
seems
the
simpsons
are
the
only
atheists
here
hattie
says
people
look
down
on
her
terribly
because
of
it
she
says
the
church
folks
consider
them
the
simpsons
that
is
the
dust
on
their
shoes
and
the
crumbs
off
the
rich
man
table
she
got
that
terribly
mixed
up
but
i
correct
her
i
think
she
did
very
well
for
an
atheist
said
carol
determined
not
to
be
totally
overlooked
in
this
discussion
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
miss
allen
well
one
day
hattie
was
walking
home
from
school
with
us
and
she
was
telling
us
about
it
the
dust
on
their
shoes
and
she
said
she
liked
miss
allen
better
than
anybody
else
in
town
i
asked
why
she
said
miss
allen
believed
the
same
things
the
simpsons
believe
only
miss
allen
dare
say
so
publicly
or
they
would
put
her
out
of
the
school
she
said
miss
allen
said
that
most
church
members
were
hypocrites
and
drunkards
and
and
just
generally
bad
and
the
ones
outside
the
church
are
nearly
always
good
and
moral
and
kind
she
said
miss
allen
joined
the
presbyterian
church
here
because
most
of
the
school
board
are
presbyterians
she
said
miss
allen
said
she
care
if
people
were
catholics
or
jews
or
atheists
or
or
just
ordinary
protestants
so
long
as
they
were
kind
to
one
another
and
went
about
the
world
doing
good
works
and
that
why
miss
allen
would
read
the
bible
and
say
the
lord
prayer
in
school
what
do
you
think
of
that
demanded
carol
is
that
heresy
she
as
bad
as
the
priest
and
levite
is
she
did
you
ask
miss
allen
about
it
no
indeed
we
just
ignored
miss
allen
ever
since
we
have
watched
her
as
closely
as
we
could
since
then
to
see
if
we
could
catch
her
up
again
of
course
she
has
to
be
careful
what
she
says
in
school
but
we
found
several
strong
points
against
her
it
a
perfectly
plain
case
no
doubt
about
it
and
so
you
went
among
the
other
freshmen
influencing
them
and
telling
tales
and
criticizing
your
no
indeed
prue
we
would
but
you
know
it
says
in
the
bible
to
beware
of
false
doctrines
and
the
sowers
of
bad
seed
or
something
like
that
and
we
bewared
as
hard
as
we
could
grinned
carol
we
have
tried
to
explain
these
things
to
the
other
freshmen
so
miss
allen
could
not
lead
them
into
into
error
oh
that
christian
science
is
it
well
minnie
carlson
is
a
christian
scientist
and
she
talks
so
much
about
falling
into
error
that
honestly
we
ca
tell
error
from
truth
any
more
interjected
carol
neatly
and
so
i
hope
you
wo
punish
us
if
we
accidentally
vary
from
the
truth
once
in
a
while
this
was
quite
beyond
prudence
depth
she
knew
little
of
christian
science
save
that
it
was
a
widely
accepted
creed
of
recent
origin
so
she
brought
the
twins
back
to
miss
allen
again
but
twins
do
you
think
it
was
kind
and
christian
and
and
like
parsonage
girls
to
accept
all
this
against
miss
allen
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
defend
herself
as
i
told
you
prue
we
have
watched
her
very
close
since
then
she
has
never
come
right
out
in
the
open
she
would
dare
but
she
has
given
herself
away
several
times
nothing
can
get
by
us
when
we
on
the
watch
you
know
prudence
knew
what
did
miss
allen
say
the
twins
thought
seriously
for
a
while
oh
yes
lark
suggested
carol
finally
do
you
remember
she
said
the
bible
was
an
allegory
what
yes
she
did
she
was
explaining
to
the
english
class
what
was
meant
by
allegory
and
she
said
the
purpose
of
using
allegory
was
to
teach
an
important
truth
in
a
homely
impressive
way
that
could
be
remembered
she
mentioned
several
prominent
allegories
and
said
the
bible
was
one
and
you
know
yourself
prue
that
the
bible
is
gospel
truth
and
i
mean
it
is
so
i
mean
what
she
means
said
lark
helpfully
is
that
the
bible
is
not
just
a
pretty
way
of
teaching
people
to
be
good
but
it
solid
fact
clear
through
that
very
well
expressed
lark
prudence
herself
could
not
have
expressed
it
half
so
well
but
how
do
you
twins
understand
all
these
things
so
thoroughly
oh
you
know
sears
is
our
teacher
and
she
always
hot
on
the
trail
of
the
higher
critics
and
heretics
she
explained
all
about
the
the
nefarious
system
to
us
one
sunday
she
says
the
higher
critics
try
to
explain
away
the
bible
by
calling
it
allegory
so
we
were
ready
for
miss
allen
there
and
whenever
anything
came
up
at
school
we
would
ask
sears
about
it
on
sunday
without
mentioning
names
of
course
she
very
much
gratified
that
we
are
so
much
interested
in
such
things
she
thinks
we
sure
to
be
deaconesses
at
the
very
least
but
carol
said
she
would
be
a
deaconess
she
was
going
to
be
a
red
cross
nurse
and
go
to
war
that
stumped
sears
for
a
while
and
then
she
said
we
could
be
red
cross
deaconess
nurses
i
wo
said
carol
because
the
deaconess
uniforms
are
as
stylish
as
the
red
cross
nurses
i
think
i
look
pretty
fine
in
a
white
uniform
with
a
stiff
little
cap
and
a
red
cross
on
my
arm
red
crosses
make
a
very
pretty
decoration
do
you
think
they
do
lark
what
else
did
miss
allen
say
at
school
prudence
demanded
leading
the
twins
back
to
the
subject
well
one
day
she
said
you
know
she
gives
uplifting
little
moral
talks
quite
often
prue
sometimes
she
tells
us
stories
with
inspiring
points
she
really
a
moral
person
i
believe
and
i
honestly
sorry
she
a
heretic
said
carol
for
i
do
want
to
be
friendly
enough
with
her
to
ask
if
she
uses
anything
on
her
complexion
to
keep
it
so
if
she
does
i
have
some
of
it
if
it
takes
all
my
next
year
clothes
lark
laughed
a
complexion
will
be
a
poor
substitute
for
oh
for
goodness
sake
twins
come
back
to
miss
allen
i
am
going
right
up
to
her
house
this
minute
to
ask
her
about
it
and
explain
she
the
one
to
do
the
explaining
seems
to
me
said
carol
belligerently
we
got
to
stick
up
for
the
bible
prue
it
our
business
and
i
do
think
you
should
tell
her
it
may
hurt
her
feelings
urged
lark
have
heretics
feelings
queried
carol
i
suppose
it
a
feeling
of
carol
will
you
quit
talking
for
a
minute
this
is
a
serious
matter
if
she
believes
all
that
nonsense
she
no
proper
teacher
and
and
she
have
to
be
put
out
of
the
high
school
and
if
she
believe
it
she
a
martyr
i
going
to
find
out
about
it
at
once
do
you
want
to
come
with
me
i
should
say
not
said
the
twins
promptly
i
think
you
very
foolish
to
go
at
all
added
lark
i
would
go
for
a
dollar
declared
carol
it
be
very
interesting
to
see
how
a
heretic
feels
but
i
do
care
to
know
how
ordinary
christians
feel
when
they
fall
into
their
hands
i
not
aching
to
see
miss
allen
so
prudence
set
forth
conscientiously
in
the
darkness
a
brave
and
heroic
thing
for
prudence
to
do
for
she
was
a
cowardly
creature
at
heart
miss
allen
heard
her
voice
in
the
lower
hall
and
came
running
to
meet
her
come
up
she
cried
eagerly
come
on
up
and
before
prudence
was
fairly
inside
the
door
she
demanded
what
is
it
did
you
find
out
is
it
my
fault
then
prudence
blushed
and
stammered
why
it
sounds
silly
but
they
think
you
are
a
heretic
miss
allen
gasped
then
she
laughed
then
she
walked
to
her
and
picked
up
a
long
hatpin
will
you
kindly
jab
this
into
me
she
said
i
having
a
nightmare
prudence
explained
in
detail
at
first
miss
allen
laughed
it
must
be
confessed
then
she
grew
very
sober
it
is
really
my
fault
she
said
for
i
should
have
remembered
that
young
people
read
a
ton
of
meaning
into
a
pound
of
words
of
course
i
am
not
guilty
miss
starr
professor
duke
and
miss
adams
can
swear
to
that
they
call
me
they
say
i
am
an
apostle
and
they
accuse
me
of
wanting
to
burn
them
both
at
the
stake
now
sit
down
and
let
me
explain
prudence
sat
down
she
was
glad
so
glad
that
this
woman
was
an
ordinary
christian
and
not
a
priest
and
a
levite
about
the
allegory
business
it
is
very
simple
what
i
said
was
this
bible
is
full
of
allegory
i
did
not
say
bible
is
allegory
i
said
the
bible
is
full
of
allegory
and
so
it
is
the
parables
for
instance
what
are
they
do
you
see
the
difference
but
it
is
really
more
serious
about
poor
little
hattie
simpson
as
the
twins
told
you
her
parents
are
atheists
her
father
is
a
bragging
boastful
fellow
hattie
herself
does
not
know
what
her
parents
believe
and
what
they
do
not
she
simply
follows
blindly
after
them
she
thinks
she
is
an
eyesore
in
mount
mark
because
of
it
she
resents
it
bitterly
but
she
feels
the
only
decent
thing
for
her
to
do
is
to
stand
by
her
folks
let
me
tell
you
about
our
conversation
i
tried
to
make
friends
with
her
for
i
truly
pity
her
she
has
no
friends
she
slinks
about
as
though
constantly
ashamed
of
herself
she
trusts
no
one
herself
least
of
all
i
tried
to
draw
her
out
and
with
partial
success
she
told
me
how
she
feels
about
it
all
i
said
wo
you
let
some
one
some
minister
who
knows
how
tell
you
about
christianity
and
explain
to
you
what
christians
really
believe
she
said
passionately
stand
by
my
folks
then
i
saw
she
was
not
ready
yet
i
said
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
for
the
present
for
you
are
too
young
now
to
take
any
definite
stand
for
yourself
it
is
true
i
told
her
many
church
members
are
not
christians
and
are
bad
immoral
people
as
your
father
says
they
are
not
christians
and
it
is
true
that
many
outside
of
the
church
are
good
moral
people
but
they
are
not
christians
either
and
then
i
said
worry
your
head
just
now
about
whether
people
are
catholics
or
jews
or
protestants
or
what
they
are
just
try
to
love
everybody
and
try
to
grow
up
to
be
such
a
sweet
kind
loving
woman
that
you
will
be
a
blessing
to
the
world
and
what
is
more
i
said
not
puzzle
your
head
now
about
why
some
believe
the
bible
and
some
do
not
just
wait
when
you
are
older
you
shall
go
into
things
for
yourself
and
make
your
own
decision
prudence
nodded
i
think
you
were
very
sweet
about
it
she
said
i
wanted
to
win
her
confidence
in
the
hope
that
some
time
a
little
later
i
myself
may
show
her
what
christ
is
to
us
and
why
we
love
the
bible
but
i
did
fight
shy
of
the
real
point
for
fear
i
might
anger
her
and
put
a
barrier
between
us
i
just
tried
to
win
her
confidence
and
her
love
to
pave
the
way
for
what
i
may
be
able
to
do
later
on
do
you
see
i
have
had
several
talks
with
her
but
she
is
not
ready
she
is
just
a
child
stubbornly
determined
to
stand
with
her
folks
right
or
wrong
i
am
trying
now
to
cultivate
the
ground
i
say
nothing
to
make
her
dislike
or
distrust
me
i
did
not
think
of
her
telling
it
to
others
and
telling
it
wrong
surely
no
one
but
the
twins
could
have
read
so
much
into
it
well
and
prudence
smiled
you
know
we
are
parsonage
people
we
have
to
stick
up
for
the
bible
as
carol
says
oh
and
about
the
bible
reading
said
miss
allen
suddenly
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
as
you
know
there
are
jews
and
catholics
and
christian
scientists
and
every
branch
of
protestant
represented
in
our
little
school
the
jews
and
christian
scientists
are
in
a
minority
the
jews
have
always
objected
to
bible
reading
but
they
were
too
few
to
be
influential
with
a
catholic
teacher
the
catholics
were
quite
willing
to
have
it
with
a
protestant
teacher
the
protestants
were
strong
for
it
but
there
was
always
friction
one
side
objecting
so
the
school
board
ruled
it
out
entirely
i
did
not
explain
this
to
the
scholars
i
did
not
want
our
young
people
to
know
of
the
petty
bickering
and
scrapping
going
on
among
the
elders
in
the
town
so
i
simply
said
that
hereafter
we
would
dispense
with
the
bible
reading
but
it
was
the
direct
order
of
the
board
i
argued
against
it
so
did
professor
duke
so
did
miss
adams
but
as
it
happens
we
are
all
three
presbyterians
it
did
no
good
then
as
prudence
rose
to
go
home
she
asked
eagerly
do
you
think
the
twins
will
like
me
now
i
do
see
how
in
the
world
they
can
help
it
declared
prudence
smiling
indeed
they
admitted
they
were
only
too
anxious
to
love
you
but
could
honestly
do
so
because
they
had
to
stick
up
for
the
bible
i
am
so
glad
and
relieved
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
gone
and
i
was
quite
bowed
down
with
the
weight
of
it
and
if
ever
i
can
help
with
poor
little
hattie
will
you
let
me
know
i
must
have
the
twins
invite
her
to
spend
some
saturday
with
us
the
way
i
make
the
girls
like
people
by
being
with
them
a
great
great
deal
just
before
she
said
good
night
prudence
murmured
hopefully
i
am
sorry
it
happened
but
it
will
be
a
good
lesson
for
the
twins
i
am
sure
that
after
this
they
will
be
less
ready
to
listen
to
gossip
and
more
ready
to
give
one
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
it
a
great
responsibility
this
raising
a
family
miss
allen
and
especially
twins
chapter
vi
an
admirer
it
must
be
remembered
that
prudence
did
not
live
in
a
sheltered
and
exclusive
city
home
where
girls
are
rigidly
withheld
from
all
unchaperoned
intercourse
with
young
men
and
old
we
know
how
things
are
managed
in
the
best
homes
of
the
big
cities
girls
are
sheltered
from
innocent
open
things
and
too
often
indulge
in
really
serious
amusements
on
the
quiet
but
this
was
the
middle
west
where
girls
are
to
be
trusted
not
all
girls
of
course
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
girls
who
need
watching
seldom
get
enough
of
it
to
keep
them
out
of
mischief
out
in
iowa
girls
and
boys
are
allowed
to
like
each
other
and
revel
in
each
other
company
and
it
is
good
for
both
prudence
was
not
a
sentimental
girl
perhaps
this
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
at
the
age
when
most
girls
are
of
boy
prudence
was
of
younger
sisters
and
when
hands
are
full
to
overflowing
there
is
small
likelihood
of
heads
being
full
of
nonsense
prudence
liked
boys
as
she
liked
girls
that
was
the
end
of
it
romance
was
to
her
a
closed
book
and
she
felt
no
inclination
to
peep
between
the
covers
had
not
come
to
her
yet
but
prudence
was
attractive
she
had
that
indescribable
charm
that
carries
a
deep
appeal
to
the
eyes
and
the
lips
and
the
hearts
of
men
happily
prudence
herself
did
not
realize
this
the
first
young
man
of
mount
mark
to
yield
to
the
charms
of
prudence
was
a
lawyer
nearly
ten
years
her
senior
this
was
just
the
type
of
man
to
become
enraptured
with
prudence
he
gazed
across
at
her
solemnly
during
the
church
service
he
waited
patiently
after
the
benediction
until
she
finished
her
methodist
practise
of
and
then
walked
joyously
home
with
her
he
said
little
but
he
gazed
in
frank
enchantment
at
the
small
womanly
girl
beside
him
he
not
half
bad
fairy
prudence
would
confide
to
her
sister
when
they
were
snug
in
their
bed
he
not
half
bad
at
all
but
at
heart
he
does
approve
of
me
he
does
know
that
himself
and
i
certainly
ca
believe
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
him
but
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
true
for
instance
he
thinks
every
one
especially
women
should
have
a
mission
in
life
a
serious
earnest
mission
i
told
him
i
did
believe
anything
of
the
kind
i
think
we
are
just
supposed
to
live
along
from
day
to
day
and
do
what
we
can
and
be
happy
and
not
say
mean
things
about
one
another
but
he
said
he
considered
that
i
was
fulfilling
the
noblest
mission
a
woman
could
have
now
what
do
you
reckon
he
meant
by
that
fairy
i
been
puzzling
my
brain
over
it
for
days
and
days
anybody
can
tell
i
am
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
have
a
mission
maybe
he
just
said
it
to
encourage
me
he
a
very
encouraging
sort
of
man
he
very
nice
oh
very
nice
indeed
but
is
it
a
nuisance
to
have
him
tagging
along
home
with
me
when
i
might
be
having
such
a
good
time
with
you
and
the
twins
or
father
can
a
girl
tell
a
man
she
prefers
to
go
home
with
her
family
without
hurting
his
feelings
is
there
any
way
to
turn
a
person
down
without
letting
him
know
it
he
so
nice
i
would
hurt
his
feelings
for
anything
but
it
such
a
bother
i
too
young
for
beaus
and
since
i
never
going
to
get
married
it
just
a
waste
of
time
and
fairy
screamed
with
laughter
but
told
prudence
she
must
solve
her
own
love
problems
and
prudence
unwilling
to
give
offense
and
preferring
endured
his
company
until
a
gay
young
college
lad
slipped
in
ahead
of
him
first
come
first
served
was
the
motto
of
heartless
prudence
and
so
she
tripped
comfortably
away
with
jimmy
laughing
at
his
silly
college
stories
and
never
thinking
to
give
more
than
a
parting
smile
at
the
solemn
face
she
left
behind
after
jimmy
came
a
grocery
clerk
named
byron
poe
smith
and
after
him
somebody
else
and
somebody
else
and
somebody
else
and
prudence
continued
to
laugh
and
thought
it
awfully
amusing
fairy
but
i
keep
wondering
what
you
and
the
twins
are
laughing
about
but
it
was
fairy
herself
who
brought
a
real
disturbing
element
into
the
life
of
prudence
one
of
the
of
the
many
college
men
had
been
deeply
smitten
by
the
charms
of
dignified
fairy
he
walked
with
her
and
talked
with
her
this
young
man
was
a
great
deal
of
a
talker
as
so
pathetically
many
college
men
are
he
planned
many
little
expeditions
and
entertainments
for
her
amusement
and
his
own
happiness
his
name
was
eugene
babler
oh
he
talks
a
lot
said
fairy
coolly
but
he
certainly
shows
one
a
good
time
and
that
the
point
you
know
she
came
in
from
college
one
afternoon
and
rattled
off
this
little
tale
to
prudence
a
few
of
us
were
on
the
campus
and
we
decided
to
go
down
the
creek
afternoon
and
take
our
suppers
there
be
ellen
stark
and
georgia
prentiss
and
myself
and
the
boys
will
be
tom
angell
and
frank
morris
and
eugene
babler
and
professor
rayburn
was
there
when
we
were
talking
about
it
and
so
we
asked
him
to
go
along
but
we
told
him
he
must
take
a
girl
and
he
said
wonder
if
your
sister
would
go
i
have
only
met
her
once
but
perhaps
on
your
recommendation
miss
fairy
and
he
paused
with
his
breath
in
the
air
inquiringly
so
i
said
you
mean
prudence
or
one
of
the
twins
he
smiled
very
kindly
and
said
mean
prudence
i
said
i
was
sure
you
would
go
and
so
you
have
to
do
it
it
a
great
honor
prue
for
all
the
girls
and
even
the
unmarried
women
on
the
fac
are
crazy
about
him
he
so
aloof
you
know
and
very
intelligent
i
swelled
with
pride
at
the
public
tribute
to
the
parsonage
professor
rayburn
of
the
gasped
prudence
oh
i
sure
he
did
mean
me
fairy
you
must
have
misunderstood
him
why
i
would
know
what
to
say
to
a
professor
you
know
what
is
his
line
bugs
cried
fairy
he
the
biology
man
and
this
is
his
first
year
here
and
he
very
brilliant
they
say
i
no
authority
on
bugs
myself
but
anyhow
every
one
just
raves
about
him
and
he
showed
very
plainly
that
he
was
anxious
to
get
acquainted
with
you
so
have
to
go
but
bugs
wailed
prudence
what
do
i
know
about
bugs
will
he
expect
me
to
know
how
to
divide
them
separate
them
you
know
i
suppose
you
mean
dissect
them
you
poor
child
screamed
fairy
divide
bugs
if
professor
could
hear
you
now
prue
he
would
be
sadly
disillusioned
you
must
just
trot
and
get
one
of
the
biology
books
and
cram
up
a
little
he
wo
expect
you
to
be
an
advanced
buggist
he
can
give
you
points
himself
men
do
love
to
have
girls
appeal
to
their
superior
knowledge
and
be
admiring
and
deferent
maybe
he
will
one
for
you
if
you
ask
him
i
wo
do
it
declared
prudence
i
do
like
bugs
anyhow
and
why
the
very
pictures
of
them
in
the
twins
books
make
me
nervous
i
wo
do
it
you
can
just
tell
him
i
do
feel
qualified
to
go
you
got
to
go
said
fairy
sternly
for
i
said
you
would
and
counting
on
it
he
going
to
phone
you
this
afternoon
and
ask
you
himself
you
got
to
go
at
that
instant
the
telephone
rang
there
professor
cried
fairy
you
tell
him
you
are
just
delighted
to
go
and
that
you
are
so
interested
in
bugs
with
a
flushed
face
prudence
took
down
the
receiver
hello
she
said
this
is
the
parsonage
and
then
a
second
later
she
said
yes
this
is
prudence
after
that
she
stood
silent
for
some
little
time
with
fairy
crouched
beside
her
trying
to
hear
then
spoke
prudence
yes
fairy
has
been
telling
me
and
it
very
kind
of
you
indeed
and
i
know
i
would
enjoy
it
but
as
i
was
telling
fairy
i
do
know
a
thing
about
bugs
and
i
do
like
them
anyhow
so
i
afraid
you
would
find
me
rather
stupid
fairy
was
striving
to
get
a
hand
over
her
sister
lips
to
stem
the
words
but
prudence
eluded
her
they
were
both
somewhat
astounded
at
the
great
peal
of
laughter
which
came
over
the
telephone
good
that
just
what
i
was
hoping
for
you
could
have
said
anything
that
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
then
shall
i
come
around
with
babler
for
you
and
your
sister
about
one
oh
that
is
very
kind
of
you
miss
starr
do
cultivate
an
interest
in
bugs
between
now
and
for
my
sake
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
doubtfully
when
the
receiver
was
once
more
on
its
hook
i
afraid
he
laughing
at
me
said
prudence
questioningly
i
should
hope
so
cried
fairy
what
in
the
world
did
you
say
that
for
could
you
have
pretended
to
be
interested
professor
likes
women
to
be
dignified
and
intellectual
and
deep
and
then
why
on
earth
did
he
ask
me
to
go
demanded
prudence
any
one
could
tell
to
look
at
me
that
i
not
dignified
and
intellectual
and
deep
and
and
i
know
he
admired
you
for
he
was
so
eager
when
he
asked
about
you
think
how
grand
it
would
be
to
speak
of
sister
mrs
professor
rayburn
and
do
be
silly
fairy
if
i
was
going
to
marry
anybody
which
i
am
not
i
hope
you
do
not
think
for
one
minute
that
i
marry
a
buggist
gracious
goodness
i
a
notion
not
to
go
a
step
i
call
him
up
and
but
fairy
only
laughed
and
after
all
prudence
looked
forward
to
the
little
outing
in
the
glorious
october
woods
with
eager
anticipation
it
was
seldom
indeed
that
she
indulged
in
away
from
the
parsonage
yet
she
was
fond
of
gaiety
long
before
one
on
that
eventful
day
she
was
ready
and
her
face
was
so
bright
and
her
eyes
so
starry
that
placid
fairy
felt
a
twinge
of
something
like
envy
you
look
like
a
creature
from
another
world
prue
she
said
if
professor
rayburn
has
any
sense
in
his
bones
he
will
fall
dead
in
love
with
you
bugs
or
no
bugs
people
do
not
have
sense
in
their
bones
fairy
and
and
shall
i
say
professor
or
just
plain
mister
professor
i
suppose
every
one
calls
him
professor
then
i
shall
say
mister
said
prudence
it
will
be
so
hard
to
enjoy
myself
if
i
keep
remembering
that
he
teaches
bugs
i
might
as
well
be
at
school
i
shall
say
mister
and
she
did
say
mister
and
she
said
it
so
sweetly
and
looked
up
into
professor
rayburn
face
so
brightly
and
with
happiness
so
evident
and
so
girlish
that
the
staid
professor
felt
a
quick
unaccountable
throbbing
down
somewhere
beneath
his
coat
he
did
look
eager
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
and
he
looked
at
prudence
continuously
just
like
ordinary
men
is
he
whispered
fairy
to
eugene
babler
called
babbie
for
short
and
for
humiliation
for
he
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
talker
even
among
college
men
the
three
young
couples
struck
off
briskly
down
the
road
and
prudence
followed
sedately
with
her
professor
fairy
says
it
was
perfectly
disgusting
of
me
to
tell
you
i
did
know
anything
about
bugs
she
said
comfortably
but
i
thought
maybe
you
were
one
of
those
professors
who
like
one
thing
so
much
they
ca
be
interested
in
anything
else
and
i
wanted
to
warn
you
but
i
guess
you
are
that
kind
after
all
oh
no
indeed
he
assured
her
fervently
looking
deep
into
her
blue
eyes
i
like
bugs
it
is
true
but
really
i
like
other
things
one
thing
at
least
much
better
is
it
a
riddle
she
inquired
am
i
supposed
to
guess
it
is
a
riddle
but
you
may
guess
think
hard
now
it
a
serious
matter
please
do
say
if
i
get
below
seventy
will
i
be
put
down
a
grade
she
asked
then
with
intense
solemnity
i
guess
girls
they
laughed
together
youthfully
you
are
right
he
said
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
prudence
answered
that
the
first
time
i
ever
got
a
hundred
in
anything
in
my
life
i
was
very
much
accustomed
to
eighties
when
i
was
in
school
i
am
very
common
and
unbrilliant
she
assured
him
fairy
says
you
are
perfectly
horribly
clever
she
glanced
up
when
she
heard
his
exclamation
and
laughed
at
his
rueful
face
oh
that
is
fairy
expression
she
thinks
brilliant
and
clever
people
are
just
adorable
it
is
only
i
who
think
them
horrible
even
prudence
could
see
that
this
did
not
help
matters
i
i
do
not
mean
that
she
stammered
i
am
sure
you
are
very
nice
indeed
and
we
are
going
to
be
good
friends
are
we
but
i
am
such
a
dunce
myself
that
i
am
afraid
of
real
clever
people
they
are
so
superior
and
so
uninteresting
and
oh
i
do
not
mean
that
either
then
prudence
laughed
at
her
predicament
i
may
as
well
give
it
up
what
i
really
mean
is
that
you
are
so
nice
and
friendly
and
interesting
that
i
can
hardly
believe
you
are
so
clever
you
are
the
nicest
smart
person
i
ever
saw
except
my
own
family
i
mean
she
smiled
up
at
him
deliciously
does
that
make
it
square
more
than
square
he
said
you
are
too
complimentary
but
the
only
thing
that
really
counts
is
whether
we
are
going
to
be
real
good
friends
as
you
suggested
we
are
are
we
the
very
best
and
closest
of
friends
yes
agreed
prudence
dimpling
i
like
men
to
be
my
friends
nice
men
i
mean
but
it
is
always
safe
so
many
start
out
to
be
good
friends
and
then
want
to
be
silly
so
a
girl
has
to
be
very
careful
but
it
perfectly
safe
with
you
and
so
we
can
be
the
very
best
of
friends
i
wo
need
to
be
watchful
for
bad
symptoms
do
you
think
me
so
unmanly
that
i
could
fall
in
love
he
asked
and
his
voice
was
curious
as
though
she
had
hurt
him
oh
of
course
you
fall
in
love
laughed
prudence
all
nice
men
but
not
with
me
that
was
what
i
meant
i
could
imagine
a
buggy
professor
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
but
the
twins
are
so
silly
and
disrespectful
and
they
thought
it
was
such
a
joke
that
i
should
even
look
at
a
professor
of
biology
that
they
began
calling
you
the
buggy
professor
but
they
do
not
mean
any
harm
by
it
not
the
least
in
the
world
they
such
nice
sweet
girls
but
young
you
know
are
your
feelings
hurt
she
asked
anxiously
not
a
bit
i
think
the
twins
and
i
will
be
tremendously
good
friends
i
quite
willing
to
be
known
as
the
buggy
professor
but
you
were
trying
to
explain
why
i
could
fall
in
love
with
you
i
suppose
you
mean
that
you
do
not
want
me
to
oh
not
that
at
all
she
hastened
to
assure
him
then
she
stopped
yes
she
said
honestly
that
is
true
too
but
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say
i
was
just
saying
that
no
one
realizes
any
more
than
i
how
perfectly
impossible
it
would
be
for
a
clever
brilliant
professor
to
fall
in
love
with
such
an
idiot
as
i
am
all
i
meant
it
for
a
compliment
she
added
seeing
he
was
not
well
pleased
he
smiled
but
it
was
a
sober
smile
you
said
it
was
true
that
you
did
not
wish
me
to
be
fond
of
you
why
do
you
like
me
then
after
all
now
he
realized
that
this
was
a
perfectly
insane
conversation
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
help
it
prudence
was
so
alluring
and
the
sky
was
so
warmly
blue
the
sunshine
so
mild
and
hazy
and
the
roadside
so
gloriously
gay
with
colors
who
could
have
sense
on
such
a
day
with
such
a
girl
as
this
oh
i
do
like
you
very
much
indeed
declared
prudence
it
a
big
relief
too
for
i
did
expect
to
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
again
but
well
i
was
scared
when
fairy
told
me
how
remarkable
you
are
i
did
want
to
disgrace
the
parsonage
and
i
knew
i
would
but
why
the
reason
i
do
not
want
you
to
fall
in
love
with
me
that
very
different
from
being
fond
of
me
i
do
want
you
to
be
that
but
when
people
fall
in
love
they
get
married
i
not
going
to
get
married
so
it
would
be
silly
to
fall
in
love
would
it
he
laughed
heartily
at
the
with
which
this
girl
disposed
of
love
and
marriage
why
are
you
going
to
be
married
he
inquired
foolishly
happy
and
showing
more
foolishness
than
happiness
just
as
we
all
do
on
such
occasions
well
it
will
be
ten
or
eleven
years
before
connie
is
fairly
raised
yes
but
you
wo
be
a
methuselah
in
eleven
years
he
smiled
no
but
you
forget
father
forget
father
are
you
raising
him
too
no
i
not
raising
him
but
i
managing
him
but
when
he
laughed
she
hastened
to
add
that
is
i
take
care
of
him
and
keep
house
for
him
and
remind
him
of
things
he
forgets
then
with
girlish
honesty
she
added
though
i
must
confess
that
he
has
to
remind
me
of
things
i
forget
oftener
than
i
do
him
i
inherited
my
forgetfulness
from
father
i
asked
him
once
if
he
inherited
his
from
grandfather
and
he
said
he
forgot
whether
grandfather
was
forgetful
or
not
father
is
very
clever
so
fairy
and
the
twins
are
the
smartest
little
things
you
ever
saw
and
connie
too
connie
is
the
oddest
keenest
child
she
wonderful
they
all
are
but
me
it
kind
of
humiliating
to
be
the
only
stupid
one
in
a
family
of
smart
folks
i
suppose
you
no
idea
how
it
feels
and
i
ca
explain
it
but
sometimes
i
think
maybe
i
ought
to
go
off
and
die
so
the
whole
family
can
shine
and
sparkle
together
as
it
is
there
just
a
dull
glow
from
my
corner
quite
pale
and
ugly
compared
with
the
brilliant
gleams
the
others
are
sending
out
said
professor
rayburn
ah
prudence
the
faint
sweet
mellow
glows
are
always
beautiful
not
sparkling
perhaps
not
brilliant
but
comforting
and
cheering
and
always
to
be
trusted
it
just
these
little
like
yours
that
make
life
worth
living
this
was
rather
deep
for
prudence
but
she
felt
instinctively
that
he
was
complimenting
her
she
thanked
him
sweetly
and
said
and
after
all
i
do
not
really
mind
being
the
stupid
one
i
think
it
rather
fun
for
then
i
can
just
live
along
comfortably
and
people
do
not
expect
much
of
me
it
would
wear
me
all
out
to
be
as
clever
as
fairy
or
as
witty
as
carol
or
as
studious
as
lark
but
i
am
most
tremendously
proud
of
them
i
assure
you
if
professor
rayburn
had
continued
along
this
interesting
and
fruitful
line
of
conversation
all
would
have
been
well
but
it
came
just
like
a
clap
of
thunder
in
the
sunshine
said
prudence
to
fairy
dramatically
as
they
sat
in
their
room
talking
things
over
that
night
we
were
having
a
perfectly
grand
time
and
i
was
just
thinking
he
was
as
nice
and
interesting
as
if
he
did
know
one
thing
to
his
name
when
crash
that
how
it
happened
fairy
wiped
her
eyes
and
lay
back
weakly
on
the
bed
go
on
she
urged
what
happened
he
stopped
right
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
about
me
something
real
nice
too
that
i
was
awfully
interested
in
and
said
miss
starr
then
he
got
down
on
his
knees
and
began
cautiously
scraping
away
the
sticks
and
leaves
then
he
fished
out
the
most
horrible
woolly
little
animal
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
he
said
it
was
a
giminythoraticus
billyancibus
and
he
was
as
tickled
over
it
as
though
he
had
just
picked
up
a
diamond
and
what
do
you
suppose
the
weird
creature
did
with
it
he
wrapped
it
in
a
couple
of
leaves
and
put
his
handkerchief
around
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
do
you
remember
when
we
were
eating
by
the
creek
and
i
got
jam
on
my
fingers
he
offered
me
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
it
off
do
you
remember
how
i
shoved
him
away
and
shuddered
i
saw
you
look
reprovingly
at
me
that
why
do
you
suppose
i
could
wipe
my
fingers
with
a
handkerchief
that
had
been
in
one
of
his
pockets
it
was
the
one
that
had
the
giminy
billibus
was
it
no
but
goodness
only
knows
what
had
been
in
this
one
an
alligator
maybe
or
a
snake
he
very
fond
of
snakes
he
says
some
of
them
are
so
useful
i
try
to
be
charitable
fairy
and
i
believe
i
would
give
even
satan
credit
for
any
good
there
was
in
him
but
it
is
too
much
to
ask
me
to
be
fond
of
a
man
who
is
fond
of
snakes
but
that
is
not
the
worst
he
put
the
giminy
thing
in
his
pocket
his
left
pocket
then
he
came
on
walking
with
me
on
my
right
side
on
my
right
side
fairy
do
you
understand
what
that
means
it
means
that
the
giminy
billibus
as
you
call
it
oh
i
would
swear
to
the
name
fairy
i
do
not
claim
to
be
smart
but
i
know
how
it
looked
well
anyhow
name
and
all
it
was
on
the
side
next
to
me
i
stopped
to
look
at
a
little
stick
and
switched
around
on
the
other
side
then
he
stooped
to
look
at
a
bunch
of
dirt
and
got
on
the
wrong
side
again
then
i
stopped
and
then
he
did
and
so
we
kept
down
the
road
a
body
would
have
thought
we
were
drunk
i
suppose
four
times
that
man
stopped
to
pick
up
some
wriggling
little
animal
and
four
times
he
deposited
his
treasure
in
one
of
his
various
pockets
do
ask
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
friends
with
such
a
being
spare
me
that
humiliation
but
the
fair
daughter
of
the
parsonage
proved
irresistibly
attractive
to
the
unfortunate
professor
and
he
was
not
to
be
lightly
shunted
aside
he
forsook
the
presbyterian
church
of
which
he
was
a
member
and
attended
the
methodist
meetings
with
commendable
assiduity
after
each
service
he
accompanied
prudence
home
and
never
failed
to
accept
her
invitations
feebly
given
to
come
in
a
minute
he
called
as
often
during
the
week
as
propriety
in
the
voice
of
prudence
deemed
fitting
it
was
wholly
unnatural
for
prudence
to
cater
to
propriety
but
professor
rayburn
did
not
know
this
weeks
passed
a
month
slipped
away
and
another
professor
rayburn
was
considered
a
fixture
in
the
parsonage
household
by
all
except
prudence
herself
who
chafed
under
her
bondage
i
ca
just
blurt
out
that
i
think
he
a
nuisance
she
mourned
to
fairy
oh
if
he
just
do
something
disgusting
so
i
could
fire
him
off
pop
just
like
that
would
it
be
glorious
but
the
professor
did
not
indulge
in
disgusting
things
and
prudence
continued
to
worry
and
fret
then
came
a
blessed
evening
when
the
minister
and
fairy
were
away
from
home
and
the
twins
and
connie
were
safely
in
their
beds
professor
rayburn
sat
with
prudence
in
the
cozy
and
prudence
was
charming
though
quiet
and
the
professor
was
only
human
prudence
had
made
tea
and
as
she
rose
to
relieve
him
of
his
empty
cup
he
also
rose
to
return
it
to
the
table
laughing
they
put
it
down
on
the
tray
each
holding
one
side
of
the
saucer
then
when
it
was
safely
disposed
of
prudence
turned
toward
him
still
laughing
at
the
silliness
of
it
very
alluring
very
winsome
and
rayburn
unexpectedly
to
himself
as
to
her
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
he
was
aghast
at
himself
once
it
was
over
and
prudence
well
let
us
say
frankly
that
prudence
was
only
relieved
for
it
came
to
her
in
a
flash
that
this
was
the
disgusting
thing
for
which
she
had
so
fervently
longed
mr
rayburn
that
was
very
stupid
and
unpardonable
of
me
prudence
he
said
quickly
i
really
did
not
think
what
i
was
doing
but
you
were
so
sweet
and
i
awfully
fond
of
you
prudence
you
know
that
prudence
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
she
felt
that
this
hardly
gave
her
the
desired
opening
so
she
waited
hoping
he
would
commit
himself
further
more
humbled
by
her
unnatural
silence
he
did
go
on
you
know
prudence
when
a
man
cares
for
a
girl
as
i
care
for
you
it
is
always
easy
for
him
to
be
sober
and
sensible
you
should
have
been
so
so
dear
prudence
sighed
happily
she
was
content
this
gave
her
the
cue
rayburn
she
said
gently
but
decidedly
i
think
you
ought
not
to
come
here
any
more
he
walked
over
to
her
quickly
and
stood
beside
the
chair
into
which
she
had
dropped
when
he
kissed
her
do
say
that
prudence
he
said
in
a
hurried
low
voice
it
is
true
she
persisted
feeling
somehow
sorry
though
she
did
not
understand
why
she
should
feel
so
i
i
well
you
know
i
you
remember
what
i
told
you
that
first
day
do
you
about
getting
married
and
falling
in
love
and
such
things
it
is
true
i
want
to
love
anybody
and
i
do
want
to
get
married
and
fairy
says
it
is
remotely
possible
that
you
might
get
very
fond
of
me
he
smiled
rather
grimly
yes
i
think
it
is
remotely
possible
then
that
settles
it
she
said
comfortably
and
besides
i
have
such
a
lot
to
do
that
i
ca
well
bother
spending
so
much
time
outside
as
i
have
with
you
i
been
neglecting
my
work
and
it
right
i
have
the
time
which
is
your
way
of
saying
that
you
do
not
like
me
is
it
prudence
stood
up
impulsively
oh
i
like
you
but
she
threw
out
her
hands
expressively
he
took
them
in
his
tenderly
firmly
but
prudence
he
argued
that
is
because
the
woman
in
you
awake
you
may
never
love
me
a
dismal
possibility
but
it
is
true
but
do
you
think
it
only
fair
that
you
should
give
me
a
chance
to
try
oh
but
that
just
the
point
she
cried
i
do
not
want
you
to
try
i
do
not
want
to
run
any
risk
at
all
i
would
marry
you
if
i
did
love
you
i
told
you
that
right
in
the
beginning
he
still
held
her
hands
in
one
of
his
caressing
them
slowly
with
the
other
what
is
there
about
me
that
you
do
not
like
he
demanded
suddenly
there
is
something
i
know
and
with
her
awful
unbelievable
honesty
prudence
told
him
yes
she
said
that
is
true
i
hated
to
mention
it
but
there
is
something
rayburn
i
just
ca
stand
the
bugs
good
heavens
the
what
the
bugs
i
ca
bear
for
you
to
be
near
me
because
i
keep
wondering
if
there
are
bugs
and
things
in
your
pocket
i
afraid
they
get
over
on
me
even
now
it
makes
me
shiver
when
you
hold
my
hands
because
i
know
you
been
handling
the
horrible
little
creatures
with
yours
he
dropped
her
hands
abruptly
and
stared
at
her
and
after
you
leave
i
get
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
look
over
the
floor
and
examine
the
chairs
to
see
if
any
have
crawled
off
it
a
terrible
feeling
rayburn
you
know
i
told
you
i
hated
i
afraid
i
hurt
your
feelings
she
said
sadly
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
such
an
idea
as
that
he
demanded
rather
angrily
do
you
think
i
have
pet
bugs
to
carry
around
with
me
for
company
no
but
do
you
remember
the
picnic
and
how
you
kept
gathering
them
up
in
your
handkerchiefs
and
putting
them
in
your
pockets
and
how
i
kept
squirming
around
to
get
on
the
other
side
i
was
trying
to
get
away
from
the
bugs
but
my
heavens
prudence
those
were
my
field
clothes
i
do
put
bugs
in
these
pockets
these
are
my
sunday
togs
he
smiled
a
little
and
i
always
wash
my
hands
you
know
he
found
it
humorous
and
yet
it
hurt
him
such
a
little
thing
to
prejudice
a
girl
so
strongly
and
one
he
liked
so
marvelously
well
you
might
forget
and
put
them
in
these
pockets
it
a
kind
of
habit
with
you
i
suppose
and
just
plain
washing
wo
take
the
idea
of
bugs
off
your
hands
prudence
you
are
only
a
girl
a
childish
girl
but
a
very
sweet
one
i
want
you
to
like
me
when
you
grow
up
you
are
going
to
be
a
wonderfully
good
and
lovely
woman
i
i
am
going
to
want
you
then
i
know
it
let
just
be
friends
now
ca
we
until
later
for
a
long
time
yet
i
promise
on
my
word
of
honor
never
to
put
another
bug
in
my
pockets
or
my
handkerchiefs
but
i
ca
promise
not
to
touch
them
for
i
have
to
do
it
in
class
that
how
i
earn
my
living
but
i
will
wash
my
hands
with
ivory
soap
and
sapolio
and
rub
them
with
cold
cream
and
powder
them
and
perfume
them
before
i
ever
come
near
you
again
wo
that
do
prudence
shook
her
head
i
know
you
are
laughing
at
me
she
said
but
i
always
told
you
i
was
just
a
silly
simpleton
and
it
is
the
bugs
altogether
i
i
like
it
better
to
be
with
my
sisters
than
than
with
me
i
see
as
i
said
the
woman
of
you
is
still
sleeping
well
we
are
young
and
i
will
wait
i
wo
bother
you
any
more
for
a
long
time
prudence
but
i
sha
forget
you
and
some
day
i
will
come
back
to
you
again
he
stared
at
her
moodily
then
he
put
his
hands
beneath
her
elbows
and
looked
into
her
eyes
searchingly
you
are
a
strange
girl
prudence
in
some
ways
you
are
so
womanly
and
in
other
ways
so
pitifully
girlish
all
the
woman
in
your
heart
seems
to
be
given
to
your
sisters
and
your
father
and
but
you
will
waken
and
i
wo
hurry
you
then
he
put
his
arms
around
her
again
and
whispered
in
her
ear
but
i
love
you
prudence
and
if
some
one
else
should
do
the
awakening
it
would
hurt
then
he
kissed
her
and
went
away
but
prudence
ran
singing
happily
oh
i
feel
like
a
bird
that
has
broken
loose
she
cried
to
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
jubilantly
oh
what
fun
it
will
be
to
come
home
from
church
with
fairy
and
the
twins
the
way
i
used
to
do
chapter
vii
lessons
in
etiquette
connie
was
lying
flat
on
her
back
near
the
register
the
twins
were
sitting
on
the
floor
near
her
hearing
each
other
conjugate
latin
verbs
and
prudence
with
her
darning
basket
was
earnestly
trying
to
solve
a
domestic
problem
how
to
get
three
pairs
of
wearable
stockings
out
of
eleven
hosiery
remnants
so
fairy
found
them
as
she
came
in
radiant
and
glowing
glorious
day
she
said
glancing
impartially
at
her
sisters
just
glorious
why
are
you
all
hugging
the
register
may
i
ask
it
is
perfect
weather
connie
you
should
be
this
minute
by
all
means
twins
are
you
enough
to
sit
on
chairs
or
wo
your
footies
reach
the
floor
babbie
eugene
babler
you
know
is
coming
to
spend
the
evening
prudence
what
is
going
on
queried
prudence
nothing
is
going
on
that
why
he
is
coming
it
too
cold
to
meander
around
outdoors
these
nights
and
so
we
shall
have
to
amuse
ourselves
inside
as
best
we
can
the
whole
family
came
to
attention
at
this
oh
goody
cried
connie
let
make
taffy
shall
we
fairy
certainly
not
this
is
a
children
party
you
go
to
bed
at
eight
as
usual
connie
now
we
must
have
something
to
eat
the
question
is
what
shall
it
be
yes
agreed
carol
with
enthusiasm
carol
was
always
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
of
something
to
eat
yes
indeed
that
is
the
question
what
shall
we
have
you
will
likely
have
pleasant
dreams
carol
was
the
cool
retort
babbie
did
not
invite
himself
to
spend
the
evening
with
you
i
believe
do
you
mean
to
suggest
demanded
lark
with
withering
scorn
that
it
is
your
intention
to
shut
yourself
up
alone
with
this
this
creature
excluding
the
rest
of
us
yes
and
have
refreshments
for
just
you
two
cried
carol
illustration
yes
and
have
refreshments
for
just
you
two
that
is
my
intention
most
certainly
the
twins
and
connie
will
not
put
in
appearance
at
all
prue
will
serve
the
refreshments
and
will
eat
with
us
babbie
and
i
shall
spend
the
evening
in
the
front
room
the
front
room
echoed
prudence
this
room
is
much
cheerier
and
more
homelike
well
babbie
is
a
member
of
the
family
you
know
said
fairy
you
are
doing
your
best
sniffed
carol
now
you
girls
must
understand
right
off
that
things
are
different
here
from
what
they
were
at
exminster
when
boys
came
to
the
house
there
they
came
to
have
a
good
time
with
the
whole
family
but
here
it
is
very
different
i
been
looking
around
and
i
got
on
to
the
system
the
proper
thing
is
to
receive
callers
privately
without
the
family
en
masse
sitting
by
and
superintending
that
etiquette
you
know
and
one
must
always
serve
refreshments
more
etiquette
men
are
such
greedy
animals
they
do
not
care
to
go
places
where
the
eats
are
forthcoming
men
are
you
referring
to
this
babbling
creature
now
interposed
carol
ouch
said
lark
but
wo
it
be
rather
poky
just
sitting
in
the
front
room
by
yourselves
all
evening
asked
prudence
doubtfully
ignoring
the
offended
twins
oh
i
dare
say
it
will
but
it
the
proper
thing
to
do
said
fairy
complacently
what
are
you
going
to
do
all
evening
connie
wanted
to
know
just
sit
and
look
at
each
other
and
admire
yourselves
the
twins
thought
this
very
clever
of
connie
so
they
both
said
ouch
approvingly
why
no
baby
dear
said
fairy
we
shall
talk
feast
our
souls
with
a
flow
of
reason
you
know
we
shall
converse
we
shall
hold
pleasant
intercourse
would
it
be
more
fun
to
have
the
girls
in
for
a
little
while
this
from
prudence
oh
it
might
but
it
would
be
the
proper
thing
at
all
college
men
do
not
care
to
be
entertained
by
babies
no
snapped
lark
the
wisdom
of
babies
is
too
deep
for
these
these
these
men
in
embryo
this
was
so
exquisitely
said
that
lark
was
quite
restored
to
amiability
by
it
in
embryo
had
been
added
to
her
vocabulary
that
very
day
in
the
biology
class
it
was
only
the
sheerest
good
fortune
which
gave
her
the
opportunity
of
utilizing
it
so
soon
and
carol
said
ouch
with
such
admiration
that
lark
spirit
soared
among
the
clouds
she
had
scored
and
what
shall
we
serve
them
urged
prudence
i
suppose
it
would
hardly
do
to
pop
corn
would
it
no
indeed
popping
corn
is
very
nice
for
the
twins
and
the
little
boys
in
the
neighborhood
fairy
smiled
with
relish
as
she
saw
the
twins
wince
at
this
thrust
but
babbie
and
i
oh
never
it
would
do
at
all
now
oyster
stew
and
crackers
i
mean
wafers
oysters
are
fearfully
expensive
fairy
objected
the
frugal
prudence
oh
we
can
stand
it
for
once
said
fairy
easily
this
is
the
first
time
and
we
must
do
something
extra
babbie
is
all
the
rage
at
school
and
the
girls
are
frantic
with
jealousy
because
i
have
cut
everybody
else
out
to
be
honest
about
it
i
ca
understand
it
myself
babbie
such
a
giddy
youngster
you
think
he
prefer
do
you
like
him
fairy
do
you
think
he
tiresome
he
talks
so
much
it
seems
to
me
to
be
sure
i
like
him
he
great
fun
he
always
joking
and
never
has
a
sensible
thought
and
hates
study
he
an
amusing
soul
i
must
say
he
going
to
attend
here
a
couple
of
years
and
then
study
pharmacy
his
father
is
a
druggist
in
ottumwa
and
quite
well
off
the
only
reason
babbie
came
here
instead
of
going
to
a
big
college
in
the
east
is
because
his
father
is
a
trustee
trustees
are
in
honor
bound
to
send
their
offspring
to
the
college
they
trustee
just
as
ministers
are
obliged
to
trade
with
the
members
when
possible
even
if
they
and
you
put
in
carol
carol
exclaimed
prudence
reprovingly
well
we
serve
oyster
stew
then
will
you
eat
in
the
no
we
eat
on
the
little
table
in
the
front
room
informally
you
know
you
must
get
it
ready
and
arrange
it
nicely
on
the
big
tray
then
you
must
come
to
the
door
and
say
you
like
a
little
oyster
stew
say
it
carelessly
as
if
we
always
have
something
to
eat
before
going
to
bed
and
i
say
yes
prudence
bring
it
right
in
then
you
bring
it
in
and
we
all
eat
that
the
way
to
do
it
babbie
had
dates
with
the
very
swellest
girls
in
school
and
he
knows
about
such
things
we
must
do
it
up
brown
swell
mocked
lark
do
it
up
brown
oh
you
be
a
of
a
college
professor
all
right
i
sure
this
young
babler
is
just
the
type
of
man
to
interest
the
modern
college
professor
swell
do
it
up
brown
ouch
grinned
carol
now
will
you
twins
run
for
the
oysters
asked
prudence
briskly
who
us
demanded
lark
indignantly
and
ungrammatically
do
you
think
we
can
carry
home
oysters
for
the
the
personal
consumption
of
this
babbling
young
prince
not
so
let
fairy
go
after
the
oysters
she
can
carry
them
home
tenderly
and
appreciatively
carol
and
i
ca
we
do
grasp
the
beauty
of
that
man
nature
oh
yes
twinnies
i
think
you
go
all
right
hurry
now
for
you
must
be
back
in
time
to
help
me
get
supper
fairy
have
to
straighten
the
front
room
and
we
wo
have
time
run
along
and
be
quick
for
a
few
seconds
the
twins
gazed
at
each
other
studiously
neither
spoke
without
a
word
they
went
to
prepare
for
their
errand
they
whispered
softly
going
through
the
upper
hall
we
better
make
a
list
said
carol
softly
so
with
heads
close
together
they
wrote
out
several
items
on
a
piece
of
paper
it
cost
quite
a
lot
objected
carol
thirty
cents
anyhow
and
prudence
make
us
pay
for
the
oysters
sure
remember
that
we
better
let
connie
in
too
suggested
lark
connie
was
hastily
summoned
and
the
twins
whispered
explanations
in
her
willing
ears
good
she
said
approvingly
it
serve
right
but
it
cost
money
said
carol
how
much
have
you
got
then
connie
understood
why
she
had
been
consulted
the
twins
always
invited
her
to
join
their
enterprises
when
money
was
required
a
quarter
she
faltered
well
we
go
shares
said
lark
generously
we
pay
a
dime
apiece
it
may
not
take
that
much
but
if
prudence
makes
us
pay
for
the
oysters
you
have
to
pay
a
third
will
you
do
that
yes
indeed
connie
was
relieved
she
did
not
always
get
off
so
easily
twins
you
must
hurry
this
was
prudence
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
the
twins
set
off
quite
hurriedly
their
first
tall
was
at
the
meat
market
a
pint
of
oysters
said
lark
briefly
when
he
brought
them
to
her
she
smelled
them
suspiciously
then
carol
smelled
are
these
rotten
oysters
she
demanded
hopefully
no
he
answered
laughing
certainly
not
have
you
got
any
rotten
ones
no
we
do
keep
that
kind
he
was
still
laughing
the
twins
sighed
and
hurried
next
door
to
the
grocer
a
nickel
worth
of
pepper
the
strongest
you
have
this
was
quickly
settled
and
the
twins
betook
themselves
to
the
corner
drug
store
we
we
want
something
with
a
perfectly
awful
smell
lark
explained
soberly
what
kind
of
a
smell
we
do
care
what
kind
but
it
must
be
perfectly
sickening
like
something
rotten
or
dead
if
you
have
it
something
that
will
stay
smelly
for
several
hours
but
it
must
be
dangerous
of
course
what
do
you
want
it
for
we
want
it
to
put
in
a
room
to
give
it
a
horrible
smell
for
an
hour
or
so
lark
winked
at
him
solemnly
it
a
joke
she
further
elucidated
i
see
his
eyes
twinkled
i
think
i
can
fix
you
up
a
moment
later
he
handed
her
a
small
bottle
just
sprinkle
this
over
the
carpet
it
wo
do
any
harm
and
it
smells
like
thunder
it
costs
a
quarter
carol
frowned
i
suppose
we
have
to
take
it
she
said
but
pretty
expensive
i
hate
to
have
druggists
get
such
a
lot
of
money
he
laughed
aloud
i
hate
to
have
you
get
a
good
licking
too
but
you
get
it
just
the
same
or
i
miss
my
guess
when
the
twins
arrived
home
fairy
was
just
cutting
the
candy
she
had
made
it
delicious
she
said
to
prudence
here
a
nice
dishful
for
you
and
the
pitch
in
twins
and
help
yourselves
very
nice
the
twins
waved
her
haughtily
away
no
thank
you
they
said
we
could
eat
that
candy
with
relish
we
are
unworthy
all
right
prudence
put
in
quickly
as
fairy
only
laughed
i
put
it
in
the
cupboard
and
fairy
and
i
will
eat
it
perfectly
fine
simply
delicious
but
the
twins
were
not
to
be
tempted
before
they
went
lark
inquired
sarcastically
i
suppose
fairy
you
don
your
best
blue
silk
in
honor
of
this
event
oh
no
was
the
ready
answer
i
just
wear
my
little
green
muslin
it
old
but
very
nice
and
comfortable
just
right
for
an
evening
at
home
yes
scoffed
carol
and
of
course
you
are
remembering
that
every
one
says
it
is
the
most
becoming
dress
you
have
oh
yes
laughed
fairy
i
remembering
that
all
right
then
the
twins
went
but
not
to
their
own
room
at
once
instead
they
slipped
noiselessly
into
the
front
bedroom
and
a
little
later
carol
came
out
into
the
hall
and
stood
listening
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
though
on
guard
be
sure
and
leave
quite
a
few
stitches
in
lark
she
whispered
once
we
want
it
to
hang
together
until
babbie
gets
here
that
was
all
presently
lark
emerged
and
their
own
door
closed
behind
them
it
a
good
thing
father
has
to
go
to
the
trustees
meeting
is
it
asked
carol
and
lark
agreed
absently
she
was
thinking
of
the
oysters
as
soon
as
they
finished
supper
lark
said
do
you
think
better
go
right
to
bed
prue
we
do
want
to
taint
the
atmosphere
of
the
parsonage
of
course
fairy
will
want
to
wash
the
dishes
herself
to
make
sure
they
are
clean
and
shining
oh
no
disclaimed
fairy
still
i
can
give
an
extra
rub
to
the
ones
we
want
to
use
that
is
enough
i
do
appreciate
the
thought
though
thanks
very
much
so
the
twins
plunged
in
carefully
keeping
connie
beside
them
she
has
such
a
look
said
carol
if
we
do
keep
hold
of
her
she
let
something
bubble
over
connie
had
a
dismal
propensity
for
giving
things
away
the
twins
had
often
suffered
from
it
they
were
determined
to
forestall
such
a
calamity
then
they
all
three
went
to
bed
to
be
sure
it
was
ridiculously
early
but
they
were
all
determined
we
feel
weak
under
this
unusual
strain
our
nerves
ca
stand
the
tension
we
really
must
retire
to
rest
maybe
a
good
night
sleep
will
restore
us
to
normal
lark
explained
gravely
fairy
only
laughed
good
she
cried
do
go
to
bed
the
only
time
i
am
sure
of
you
is
when
you
are
in
your
beds
do
you
mind
if
i
tie
you
in
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
but
the
twins
and
connie
had
disappeared
you
keep
your
eyes
open
fairy
prudence
whispered
melodramatically
those
girls
do
not
look
right
something
is
hanging
over
our
heads
and
she
added
anxiously
oh
i
be
so
disappointed
if
things
go
badly
this
is
the
first
time
we
ever
lived
up
to
etiquette
and
i
feel
it
is
really
a
crisis
fairy
was
a
little
late
getting
to
dress
but
she
took
time
to
drop
into
her
sisters
room
they
were
all
in
bed
breathing
heavily
she
walked
from
one
to
another
and
stood
above
them
majestically
asleep
she
cried
ah
fortune
is
kind
they
are
asleep
how
i
love
these
darling
little
twinnies
in
their
sleep
an
audible
sniff
from
beneath
the
covers
and
fairy
smiling
mischievously
went
into
the
front
room
to
prepare
for
her
caller
the
bell
rang
as
she
was
dressing
prudence
went
to
the
door
preternaturally
ceremonious
and
ushered
babler
into
the
front
room
she
turned
on
the
electric
switch
as
she
opened
the
door
she
was
too
much
impressed
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
to
take
much
note
of
her
surroundings
and
she
did
not
observe
that
the
young
man
sniffed
in
a
peculiar
manner
as
he
entered
the
room
i
call
fairy
she
said
demurely
tell
her
she
need
primp
for
me
he
answered
laughing
i
know
just
how
she
looks
already
but
prudence
was
too
heavily
burdened
to
laugh
she
smiled
hospitably
and
closed
the
door
upon
him
fairy
was
tripping
down
the
stairs
very
tall
very
handsome
very
gay
she
pinched
her
sister
arm
as
she
passed
and
the
front
room
door
swung
behind
but
she
did
not
greet
her
friend
she
stood
erect
by
the
door
her
head
tilted
on
one
side
sniffing
sniffing
what
in
the
world
she
wondered
then
she
blushed
perhaps
it
was
something
he
had
used
on
his
hair
or
perhaps
he
had
been
having
his
suit
cleaned
oh
i
guess
it
nothing
after
all
she
stammered
but
eugene
babler
was
strangely
quiet
he
looked
about
the
room
in
a
peculiar
questioning
way
shall
i
raise
a
window
he
suggested
finally
it
rather
er
hot
in
here
yes
do
she
urged
raise
all
of
them
it
do
you
do
you
notice
a
a
funny
smell
in
here
or
am
i
imagining
it
it
it
almost
makes
me
sick
yes
there
is
a
smell
he
said
in
evident
relief
i
thought
maybe
you
been
cleaning
the
carpet
with
something
it
ghastly
ca
we
go
somewhere
else
come
on
she
opened
the
door
into
the
we
coming
out
here
if
you
do
not
mind
prue
and
fairy
explained
the
difficulty
why
that
very
strange
said
prudence
knitting
her
brows
i
was
in
there
right
after
supper
and
i
did
notice
anything
what
does
it
smell
like
it
a
new
smell
to
me
laughed
fairy
but
something
about
it
is
strangely
suggestive
of
our
prudence
went
to
investigate
and
fairy
shoved
a
big
chair
near
the
table
waving
her
hand
toward
it
lightly
with
a
smile
at
babbie
then
she
sank
into
a
low
rocker
and
leaned
one
arm
on
the
table
she
wrinkled
her
forehead
thoughtfully
that
smell
she
began
i
am
very
suspicious
about
it
it
was
not
at
all
natural
excuse
me
fairy
he
said
ill
at
ease
for
the
first
time
in
her
knowledge
of
him
did
you
know
your
sleeve
was
coming
out
fairy
gasped
and
raised
her
arm
both
arms
apparently
he
continued
smiling
but
his
face
was
flushed
excuse
me
just
a
minute
will
you
fairy
was
unruffled
she
sought
her
sister
look
here
prue
what
do
you
make
of
this
i
coming
to
pieces
i
hanging
by
a
single
thread
as
it
were
her
sleeves
were
undoubtedly
ready
to
drop
off
at
a
second
notice
prudence
was
shocked
she
grew
positively
white
in
the
face
oh
fairy
she
wailed
we
are
disgraced
not
a
bit
of
it
said
fairy
coolly
i
remember
now
that
lark
was
looking
for
the
scissors
before
supper
are
those
twins
unique
this
is
almost
bordering
on
talent
is
it
do
look
so
distressed
prue
etiquette
itself
must
be
subservient
to
twins
it
seems
do
forget
to
bring
in
the
stew
at
a
quarter
past
nine
and
have
it
as
good
as
possible
please
dear
i
will
vowed
prudence
i
i
use
cream
oh
those
horrible
twins
go
in
and
entertain
babbie
till
i
come
down
wo
you
and
fairy
ran
lightly
up
the
stairs
humming
a
snatch
of
song
but
prudence
did
a
poor
job
of
entertaining
babbie
during
her
absence
she
felt
really
dizzy
such
a
way
to
introduce
etiquette
into
the
parsonage
life
she
was
glad
to
make
her
escape
from
the
room
when
fairy
returned
a
graceful
figure
in
the
fine
blue
silk
she
went
back
to
the
and
painstakingly
arranged
the
big
tray
for
the
designated
moment
of
its
entrance
according
to
etiquette
fairy
and
babbie
in
the
next
room
talked
incessantly
laughing
often
and
long
and
prudence
hearing
smiled
in
sympathy
she
herself
thought
it
would
be
altogether
stupid
to
be
shut
up
in
a
room
alone
with
just
a
man
for
a
whole
evening
but
etiquette
required
it
fairy
knew
about
such
things
of
course
a
little
after
nine
she
called
out
dismally
fairy
and
fairy
fearing
fresh
disaster
came
running
out
what
now
what
i
forget
what
you
told
me
to
say
whispered
prudence
wretchedly
what
was
it
the
soup
is
ready
and
piping
hot
but
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
say
fairy
screamed
with
laughter
you
goose
she
cried
say
anything
you
like
i
was
just
giving
you
a
tip
that
was
all
it
does
make
any
difference
what
you
say
oh
i
am
determined
to
do
my
part
just
right
vowed
prudence
fervently
according
to
etiquette
and
all
what
was
it
you
said
fairy
stifled
her
laughter
with
difficulty
and
said
in
a
low
voice
would
you
like
a
little
nice
hot
oyster
stew
prudence
repeated
it
after
her
breathlessly
so
fairy
returned
once
more
and
soon
after
prudence
tapped
on
the
door
then
she
opened
it
and
thrust
her
curly
head
inside
you
like
a
little
nice
hot
oyster
stew
she
chirped
methodically
and
fairy
said
oh
yes
indeed
prudence
this
is
so
nice
of
you
the
stew
was
steaming
hot
and
the
three
gathered
sociably
about
the
table
prudence
was
talking
fairy
was
passing
the
crackers
prudence
kicked
her
foot
gently
beneath
the
table
to
remind
her
that
etiquette
calls
them
wafers
so
it
happened
that
babbie
was
first
to
taste
the
steaming
stew
he
gasped
and
gulped
and
swallowed
some
water
with
more
haste
than
grace
then
he
toyed
idly
with
spoon
and
wafer
until
prudence
tasted
also
prudence
did
not
gasp
she
did
not
cry
out
she
looked
up
at
her
sister
with
wide
hurt
eyes
a
world
of
pathos
in
the
glance
but
fairy
did
not
notice
now
please
do
not
ask
me
to
talk
until
i
have
finished
my
soup
she
was
saying
brightly
i
simply
can
not
think
and
appreciate
oyster
stew
at
the
same
time
then
she
appreciated
it
she
dropped
her
spoon
with
a
great
clatter
and
jumped
up
from
the
table
mercy
she
shrieked
it
is
poisoned
babbie
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
until
his
eyes
were
wet
prudence
eyes
were
wet
too
but
not
from
laughter
what
would
etiquette
think
of
her
after
this
what
did
you
do
to
this
soup
prudence
demanded
fairy
i
made
it
nothing
else
faltered
poor
prudence
quite
crushed
by
this
blow
and
oysters
forty
cents
a
pint
it
pepper
i
think
gasped
babbie
my
insides
bear
startling
testimony
to
the
presence
of
pepper
and
he
roared
again
while
prudence
began
a
critical
examination
of
the
oysters
she
found
them
literally
stuffed
with
pepper
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
the
twins
had
done
deadly
work
their
patience
at
least
was
commendable
it
seemed
that
not
one
oyster
had
escaped
their
attention
the
entire
pint
had
been
ruined
by
the
pepper
revenge
ye
gods
how
sweet
chanted
fairy
the
twins
are
getting
even
with
a
vengeance
the
same
twins
you
said
were
adorable
babbie
it
must
be
said
for
fairy
that
her
good
nature
could
stand
almost
anything
even
this
did
not
seriously
disturb
her
do
you
suppose
you
can
find
us
some
milk
prue
and
crackers
i
so
fond
of
crackers
and
milk
are
you
babbie
oh
i
adore
it
but
serve
a
microscope
with
it
please
i
want
to
examine
it
for
microbes
before
i
taste
but
prudence
did
better
than
that
she
made
some
delicious
cocoa
and
opened
a
can
of
pear
preserves
donated
to
the
parsonage
by
the
amiable
adams
the
twins
were
very
fond
of
pear
preserves
and
had
been
looking
forward
to
eating
these
on
their
approaching
birthday
they
were
doomed
to
disappointment
the
three
had
a
merry
little
feast
after
all
and
their
laughter
rang
out
so
often
and
so
unrestrainedly
that
the
twins
shook
in
their
beds
with
rage
and
disappointment
starr
came
in
while
they
were
eating
and
joined
them
genially
but
afterward
when
prudence
realized
that
etiquette
called
for
their
retirement
her
father
still
sat
complacently
by
the
register
talking
and
laughing
prudence
fastened
her
eyes
upon
him
well
i
must
honestly
go
to
bed
she
said
gazing
hypnotically
at
her
father
i
know
you
will
excuse
me
i
must
store
up
my
strength
to
deal
with
the
twins
in
the
morning
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
still
boring
her
father
with
her
eyes
he
did
not
move
she
paused
beside
him
and
slipped
her
hand
under
his
elbow
now
father
she
said
gaily
we
must
put
our
heads
together
and
think
out
a
proper
punishment
for
the
awful
creatures
her
hand
was
uplifting
and
starr
rose
with
it
together
they
left
the
room
with
cordial
good
nights
and
inviting
babler
to
try
the
parsonage
again
prudence
listened
outside
the
twins
door
and
heard
them
breathing
loudly
then
she
went
to
her
own
room
and
snuggling
down
beneath
the
covers
laughed
softly
to
herself
etiquette
she
gurgled
etiquette
there
no
room
for
such
a
thing
in
a
parsonage
i
see
that
it
speaks
well
for
the
courage
of
babbie
and
the
attractions
of
fairy
that
he
came
to
the
parsonage
again
and
again
in
time
he
became
the
best
of
friends
with
the
twins
themselves
but
he
always
called
them
the
adorables
and
they
never
asked
him
why
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
them
by
prudence
rankled
in
their
memories
for
many
months
indeed
upon
that
occasion
prudence
fairly
surpassed
herself
in
the
ingenuity
she
displayed
the
twins
considered
themselves
very
nearly
as
as
fairy
and
the
fact
that
she
was
a
young
lady
and
they
were
children
filled
their
hearts
with
bitterness
they
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
showing
their
independence
where
she
was
concerned
and
with
marvelous
insight
prudence
used
fairy
as
her
weapon
of
punishment
in
fact
the
twins
called
fairy
the
for
many
days
the
offense
was
against
fairy
said
prudence
with
a
solemnity
she
did
not
feel
and
the
reparation
must
be
done
to
her
for
three
weeks
you
must
do
all
of
her
bedroom
work
and
run
every
errand
she
requires
moreover
you
must
keep
her
shoes
well
cleaned
and
nicely
polished
and
must
do
every
bit
of
her
darning
the
twins
would
have
preferred
whipping
a
thousand
times
they
felt
they
had
got
a
whipping
worth
of
pleasure
out
of
their
mischief
but
a
punishment
like
this
sat
heavily
upon
their
proud
young
shoulders
and
from
that
time
on
they
held
fairy
practically
immune
from
their
pranks
but
prudence
did
not
bother
her
head
about
etiquette
after
that
experience
i
strong
for
comfort
she
declared
and
since
the
two
can
not
live
together
in
our
family
i
say
we
do
without
etiquette
and
fairy
nodded
in
agreement
smiling
chapter
viii
the
first
dark
shadow
of
winter
prudence
and
fairy
stood
in
the
bay
window
of
the
and
looked
out
at
the
thickly
falling
snow
already
the
ground
was
whitely
carpeted
and
the
peach
trees
just
outside
the
parsonage
windows
were
beginning
to
bow
down
beneath
their
burdens
is
it
beautiful
prudence
whispered
fairy
is
it
beautiful
oh
i
love
it
when
it
snows
yes
and
you
love
it
when
the
sun
shines
too
said
prudence
and
when
it
rains
and
when
the
wind
is
blowing
you
have
the
soul
of
a
poet
that
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
a
as
carol
would
say
fairy
turned
abruptly
from
the
window
do
talk
for
a
minute
prue
i
want
to
write
so
prudence
stood
quietly
in
the
window
listening
to
the
pencil
scratching
behind
her
listen
now
prue
how
is
this
fairy
had
a
clear
expressive
voice
a
bright
voice
prudence
called
it
and
as
she
read
her
simple
lines
aloud
the
heart
of
prudence
swelled
with
pride
to
prudence
fairy
was
a
wonderful
girl
good
night
little
baby
earth
going
to
sleep
tucked
in
your
blankets
all
woolly
and
deep
close
your
tired
eyelids
droop
your
tired
head
nestle
down
sweetly
within
your
white
bed
kind
mother
sky
bending
softly
above
is
holding
you
close
in
her
bosom
of
love
closely
she
draws
the
white
coverlets
warm
she
will
be
near
you
to
shield
you
from
harm
soon
she
will
set
all
her
candles
alight
to
scatter
the
darkness
and
save
you
from
fright
then
she
will
leave
her
ajar
to
watch
you
that
nothing
your
slumbers
may
mar
rest
little
baby
earth
rest
and
sleep
tight
the
winter
has
come
and
we
bid
you
good
night
fairy
laughed
but
her
face
was
flushed
how
is
that
she
demanded
oh
fairy
cried
prudence
it
is
wonderful
how
can
you
think
of
such
sweet
little
things
may
i
have
it
may
i
keep
it
oh
i
think
it
is
perfectly
dear
i
wish
i
could
do
that
i
never
in
the
world
would
have
thought
of
baby
earth
going
to
sleep
and
mother
sky
tucking
her
in
white
i
think
you
are
just
wonderful
fairy
fairy
eyes
were
bright
at
the
praise
but
she
laughed
as
she
answered
you
always
think
me
and
my
scribbles
perfection
prue
even
the
love
verses
that
shocked
the
ladies
aid
you
are
a
bad
critic
but
does
the
snow
make
you
think
pretty
things
prudence
come
now
as
you
stood
at
the
window
there
what
were
you
thinking
i
was
just
wondering
if
connie
wore
her
rubbers
to
school
and
if
father
remembered
to
take
his
muffler
fairy
burst
into
renewed
laughter
oh
you
precious
old
practical
prudence
she
gurgled
rubbers
and
mufflers
with
such
a
delicious
snowfall
as
this
oh
prudence
shame
upon
you
prudence
was
ashamed
oh
i
know
i
am
a
perfect
idiot
fairy
she
said
i
know
it
better
than
anybody
else
i
am
so
ashamed
of
myself
all
the
time
then
she
added
rather
shyly
fairy
are
you
ashamed
of
me
sometimes
when
the
college
girls
are
here
and
you
are
all
talking
so
brilliantly
are
you
kind
of
mortified
that
i
am
so
stupid
and
dull
i
do
not
care
if
outsiders
do
think
i
am
inferior
to
the
rest
of
you
but
really
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
ashamed
of
me
i
oh
i
know
it
myself
that
i
do
not
amount
to
anything
and
never
will
but
it
would
hurt
if
i
thought
you
and
the
twins
were
going
to
find
me
humiliating
prudence
was
looking
at
her
sister
hungrily
her
lips
drooping
her
eyes
dark
for
a
long
instant
fairy
stared
at
her
incredulously
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
her
face
white
her
eyes
blazing
prudence
starr
she
cried
furiously
how
dare
you
say
such
things
of
us
do
you
think
we
are
as
despicable
as
all
that
oh
prudence
i
never
was
so
insulted
in
all
my
life
ashamed
of
you
ashamed
why
we
are
proud
of
you
every
one
of
us
daddy
too
we
think
you
are
the
finest
and
dearest
girl
that
ever
lived
we
think
oh
i
think
god
himself
must
be
proud
of
a
girl
like
you
prudence
starr
ashamed
of
you
and
fairy
bursting
into
tears
rushed
wildly
out
of
the
room
for
all
her
poetical
nature
fairy
was
usually
and
calm
only
twice
before
in
all
her
life
had
prudence
seen
her
so
and
now
greatly
disturbed
yet
pleased
at
the
passionate
avowals
she
hurried
away
in
search
of
her
sister
she
needed
no
more
assurance
of
her
attitude
so
the
twins
and
connie
came
into
an
empty
room
and
chattered
away
to
themselves
abstractedly
for
an
hour
then
prudence
came
down
instantly
connie
was
asked
the
question
are
your
feet
wet
connie
solemnly
took
three
steps
across
the
room
hear
me
sqush
she
said
proudly
she
did
sqush
too
constance
starr
i
am
ashamed
of
you
this
is
positively
wicked
you
know
it
is
a
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
that
you
change
your
shoes
and
stockings
as
soon
as
you
come
in
when
your
feet
are
wet
do
it
at
once
i
get
some
hot
water
so
you
can
soak
your
feet
too
and
you
shall
drink
some
good
hot
peppermint
tea
into
the
bargain
i
teach
you
to
sit
around
in
wet
clothes
do
you
think
i
want
an
invalid
on
my
hands
oh
do
be
so
fussy
said
connie
fretfully
wet
feet
do
do
any
harm
but
she
obligingly
soaked
her
feet
and
drank
the
peppermint
are
your
feet
wet
twins
no
said
lark
we
have
better
judgment
than
to
go
splashing
through
the
wet
old
what
the
matter
with
you
carol
why
do
you
sit
still
are
your
feet
wet
no
but
it
too
hot
in
this
room
my
clothes
feel
sticky
may
i
open
the
door
prudence

no
the
snow

blowing
a
hurricane
now

and
ask
papa
if

him
and
connie
i

a
minute
peace
in
the
winter
time
you
go
lark
said
carol
my
head
aches
do
you
want
me
to
rub
it
asked
prudence
as
lark
skipped
for
her
twin
no
it
just
the
closeness
in
here
it
does
ache
very
bad
if
we
do
have
more
fresh
air
we
all
get
something
and
die
i
tell
you
that
this
room
is
perfectly
i
do
not
want
to
talk
any
more
and
carol
got
up
from
her
chair
and
walked
restlessly
about
the
room
but
carol
was
sometimes
given
to
moods
and
so
without
concern
prudence
went
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
the
evening
meal
papa
says
his
feet
are
not
wet
and
that
you
are
a
big
simpleton
and
oh
did
you
make
cinnamon
rolls
prue
oh
goody
carrie
come
on
out
look
she
made
cinnamon
rolls
connie
too
hastened
out
to
the
kitchen
in
her
bare
feet
and
was
promptly
driven
back
by
the
watchful
prudence
i
just
know
you
are
going
to
be
sick
connie
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
and
walking
out
in
that
cold
kitchen
in
your
bare
feet
you
can
just
drink
some
more
peppermint
tea
for
that
now
well
give
me
a
cinnamon
roll
to
go
with
it
urged
connie
peppermint
is
awfully
dry
taken
by
itself
lark
hooted
gaily
at
this
sentiment
but
joined
her
sister
in
pleading
for
cinnamon
rolls
no
wait
until
supper
is
ready
you
do
not
need
to
help
peel
the
potatoes
carol
run
back
where
it
is
warm
and
you
must
not
read
if
your
head
aches
you
read
too
much
anyhow
i
help
lark
with
the
potatoes
no
do
not
take
the
paper
carol
i
said
you
must
not
read
then
lark
and
prudence
working
together
and
talking
much
prepared
the
supper
for
the
family
when
they
gathered
about
the
table
prudence
looked
critically
at
connie
are
you
beginning
to
feel
sick
do
you
feel
like
sneezing
or
any
thing
connie
awfully
naughty
papa
her
feet
were
just
oozing
water
and
she
sat
there
in
her
wet
shoes
and
stockings
just
like
a
stupid
are
you
going
to
eat
any
supper
carol
are
you
sick
what
is
the
matter
does
your
head
still
ache
oh
it
does
ache
exactly
but
i
do
not
feel
hungry
no
i
am
not
sick
prudence
so
do
stew
about
it
i
just
not
hungry
the
meat
is
too
greasy
and
the
potatoes
are
lumpy
i
think
i
take
a
cinnamon
roll
but
she
only
picked
it
to
pieces
idly
prudence
watched
her
with
the
intense
suspicious
gaze
of
a
frightened
mother
bird
there
are
some
canned
oysters
out
there
carol
if
i
make
you
some
soup
will
you
eat
it
this
was
a
great
concession
for
the
canned
oysters
were
kept
in
anticipation
of
unexpected
company
but
carol
shook
her
head
impatiently
i
am
not
hungry
at
all
she
said
i
open
some
pineapple
or
those
beautiful
pickled
peaches
adams
gave
us
or
or
anything
if
you
just
eat
something
carrie
still
carol
shook
her
head
i
said
i
was
hungry
prudence
but
her
face
was
growing
very
red
and
her
eyes
were
strangely
bright
she
moved
her
hands
with
unnatural
restless
motions
and
frequently
lifted
her
shoulders
in
a
peculiar
manner
do
your
shoulders
hurt
carol
asked
her
father
who
was
also
watching
her
anxiously
oh
it
feels
kind
of
well
tight
i
guess
in
my
chest
but
it
does
hurt
it
hurts
a
little
when
i
breathe
deep
is
your
throat
still
sore
carol
inquired
lark
do
you
remember
saying
you
could
swallow
when
we
were
coming
home
from
school
it
is
sore
now
said
carol
and
as
though
intolerant
of
further
questioning
she
left
the
quickly
shall
i
put
flannel
on
her
chest
and
throat
father
asked
prudence
nervously
yes
and
if
she
gets
worse
we
will
call
the
doctor
it
probably
just
a
cold
but
we
must
it
is

papa
you
know
that
cried
prudence
passionately
for
there
were
four
reported
cases
of
that
dread
disease
in
mount
mark
but
the
pain
in
carol
chest
did
grow
worse
and
she
became
so
feverish
that
she
began
talking
in
quick
broken
sentences
it
was
too
hot
do
go
away
larkie
her
feet
were
wet
and
it
kept
squshing
i
guess
i
kind
of
sick
do
put
that
thing
on
my
head
it
is
strangling
me
oh
i
ca
get
my
breath
and
she
flung
her
hand
out
sharply
as
though
to
push
something
away
from
her
face
then
starr
went
to
the
telephone
and
hurriedly
called
the
doctor
prudence
meanwhile
had
undressed
carol
and
put
on
her
little
pink
flannel
nightgown
go
out
in
the
kitchen
girls
and
shut
the
door
she
said
to
her
sisters

around

suddenly
stricken
fairy
she
cried

once

the
others

you
and

the
door
shut

lark

herself

beside
her
twin
and
burst
into
choking
sobs

she
pressed
her
burning
hands
against
her
chest

her
father
stepping
quickly
to
her
side
go
out
to
the
kitchen
at
once

and
lark
cowed
and
quivering
rushed
into
the
kitchen
and
closed
the
door
i
carry
her
to
bed
prue
said
her
father
striving
to
render
his
voice
natural
for
the
sake
of
the
suffering
oldest
daughter
whose
tense
white
face
was
frightening
together
they
carried
the
child

prudence

we
will
get
a
nurse
prudence
we
could
let
you
run
a
risk
like
that
it
would
not
be
right
if
i
could
take
care
of
her
properly
myself
i
you
could
father
and
it
would
be
wicked
for
you
to
take
such
chances
what
would
the
others
do
without
you
but
it
would
not
make
any
difference
about
me
i
not
important
he
can
give
me
and
i
such
a
healthy
girl
there
will
be
no
danger
but
she
must
not
be
shut
alone
with
a
nurse
she
would
die
and
carol
took
up
the
words
screaming
i
will
die
i
will
die
do
leave
me
prudence
do
shut
me
up
alone
prudence
prudence
in
the
kitchen
three
frightened
girls
clung
to
one
another
crying
bitterly
as
they
heard
poor
carol
piercing
screams
it
is
pneumonia
said
the
doctor
after
an
examination
and
he
looked
at
prudence
critically
i
think
we
must
have
a
nurse
for
a
few
days
it
may
be
a
little
severe
and
you
are
not
quite
strong
enough
then
as
prudence
remonstrated
oh
yes
he
granted
you
shall
stay
with
her
but
if
it
is
very
serious
a
nurse
will
be
of
great
service
i
will
have
one
come
at
once
then
he
paused
and
listened
to
the
indistinct
sobbing
that
floated
up
from
the
kitchen
ca
you
send
those
girls
away
for
the
night
to
some
of
the
neighbors
it
will
be
much
better
but
this
the
younger
girls
stubbornly
refused
to
do
if
you
send
me
out
of
the
house
when
carol
is
sick
i
will
kill
myself
said
lark
in
such
a
strange
voice
that
the
doctor
eyed
her
sharply
well
if
you
will
all
stay
and
keep
quiet
so
as
not
to
annoy
your
sister
he
consented
grudgingly
the
least
sobbing
or
confusion
or
excitement
may
make
her
much
worse
fix
up
a
bed
on
the
floor
down
here
all
of
you
and
go
to
sleep
i
wo
go
to
bed
said
lark
looking
up
at
the
doctor
with
agonized
eyes
i
wo
go
to
bed
while
carol
is
sick
give
her
a
cup
of
something
hot
to
drink
he
said
to
fairy
curtly
i
wo
drink
anything
said
lark
i
wo
drink
anything
and
i
wo
eat
a
bite
of
anything
until
carol
is
well
i
wo
sleep
either
the
doctor
took
her
hand
in
his
and
deftly
pushed
the
sleeve
above
the
elbow
you
can
twist
my
arm
if
you
like
but
i
wo
eat
and
i
wo
drink
and
i
wo
sleep
the
doctor
smiled
swiftly
inserting
the
point
of
his
needle
in
her
arm
he
released
her
i
wo
hurt
you
but
i
am
pretty
sure
you
will
be
sleeping
in
a
few
minutes
he
turned
to
fairy
get
her
ready
for
bed
at
once
the
little
one
can
wait
an
hour
later
he
came
again
is
she
sleeping
he
asked
of
fairy
in
a
low
voice
that
is
good
you
have
your
work
cut
out
for
you
my
girl
the
little
one
here
will
be
all
right
but
this
twin
is
in
nearly
as
bad
shape
as
the
one
oh
doctor
larkie
too
oh
she
is
not
sick
but
she
is
too
intense
she
is
taking
this
too
hard
her
system
is
not
well
enough
developed
to
stand
such
a
strain
very
long
something
would
give
way
maybe
her
brain
she
must
be
watched
she
must
eat
and
sleep
there
is
school
there
but
i
am
sure
lark
will
not
go
doctor
she
has
never
been
to
school
a
day
in
her
life
without
carol
i
am
sure
she
will
not
go
let
her
stay
at
home
then
do
get
her
excited
but
make
her
work
keep
her
doing
little
tasks
about
the
house
and
send
her
on
errands
talk
to
her
a
good
deal
prudence
will
have
her
hands
full
with
the
other
twin
and
you
have
all
you
can
do
with
this
one
depending
on
you
my
girl
you
must
fail
me
that
was
the
beginning
of
an
anxious
week
for
two
days
carol
was
in
delirium
most
of
the
time
calling
out
crying
screaming
affrightedly
and
lark
crouched
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
hands
clenched
passionately
her
slender
form
tense
and
motionless
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
as
the
doctor
was
coming
down
from
the
sick
room
that
fairy
called
him
into
the
with
a
suggestive
glance
she
wo
eat
she
said
i
have
done
everything
possible
and
i
had
the
nurse
try
but
she
will
not
eat
a
bite
i
i
sorry
doctor
but
i
ca
make
her
what
has
she
been
doing
she
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
all
day
she
wo
do
a
thing
i
tell
her
she
wo
mind
the
nurse
father
told
her
to
keep
away
too
but
she
does
not
pay
any
attention
when
i
speak
to
her
she
does
not
answer
when
she
hears
you
coming
down
she
runs
away
and
hides
but
she
goes
right
back
again
can
your
father
make
her
eat
if
he
commands
her
i
do
not
know
i
doubt
it
but
we
can
try
here
some
hot
soup
i
call
father
so
lark
was
brought
into
the
and
her
father
came
down
the
stairs
the
doctor
whispered
an
explanation
to
him
in
the
hall
lark
said
her
father
gently
but
very
firmly
you
must
eat
or
you
will
be
sick
too
we
need
all
of
our
time
to
look
after
carol
do
you
want
to
keep
us
away
from
her
to
attend
to
you
no
father
of
course
not
i
wish
you
would
all
go
right
straight
back
to
carrie
this
minute
and
leave
me
alone
i
all
right
but
i
ca
eat
until
carol
is
well
her
father
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
said
sit
down
and
eat
that
soup
at
once
larkie
lark
face
quivered
but
she
turned
away
i
ca
father
you
do
understand
i
ca
eat
i
really
ca
carrie
my
twin
and
oh
father
do
you
see
how
it
is
he
stood
for
a
moment
frowning
at
her
thoughtfully
then
he
left
the
room
signing
for
the
doctor
to
follow
i
send
prudence
down
he
said
she
manage
some
way
i
must
stay
here
until
i
see
her
eat
it
said
the
doctor
if
she
wo
do
it
she
must
be
kept
under
morphine
for
a
few
days
but
better
not
try
prudence
by
all
means
so
prudence
eyes
came
down
from
the
room
where
she
had
served
her
sister
many
weary
hours
the
doctor
was
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
fairy
was
hovering
anxiously
near
lark
rigid
at
the
window
larkie
whispered
prudence
and
with
a
bitter
cry
the
young
girl
leaped
into
her
sister
arms
prudence
caressed
and
soothed
her
tenderly
poor
little
larkie
she
murmured
poor
little
twinnie
but
carol
is
resting
pretty
well
now
lark
she
coming
through
all
right
she
was
conscious
several
times
the
first
time
she
just
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
and
whispered
luck
prue
then
a
little
later
she
said
larkie
i
doing
fine
and
do
let
her
worry
pretty
soon
she
spoke
again
make
lark
be
sensible
prue
or
she
be
sick
too
once
again
she
started
to
say
something
about
you
but
she
was
too
sick
to
finish
is
such
a
but
that
was
as
far
as
she
could
go
she
was
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
lark
she
is
so
afraid
worry
and
make
yourself
sick
too
she
would
be
heartbroken
if
she
was
able
to
see
you
and
you
were
too
sick
to
come
to
her
you
must
keep
up
your
strength
for
carol
sake
if
she
is
conscious
we
going
to
bring
you
up
a
while
to
see
her
she
can
hardly
stand
being
away
from
you
i
know
but
you
must
get
and
bring
some
color
to
your
cheeks
first
it
would
make
her
miserable
to
see
you
like
this
lark
was
still
sobbing
but
more
gently
now
and
she
still
clung
to
her
sister
prudence
honestly
may
i
go
up
you
not
just
fooling
me
are
you
you
would
do
that
of
course
i
would
yes
you
really
may
if
you
be
good
and
make
yourself
look
better
it
would
be
very
bad
for
carrie
to
see
you
so
white
and
wan
she
would
worry
have
you
been
eating
you
must
eat
lots
and
then
take
a
good
run
toward
bedtime
so
you
will
sleep
well
it
will
be
a
good
tonic
for
carol
to
see
you
bright
and
fresh
and
rosy
oh
i
ca
bear
to
be
fresh
and
rosy
when
carrie
is
sick
it
hurts
but
you
are
willing
to
be
hurt
for
carol
sake
you
will
do
it
on
her
account
it
will
do
her
so
much
good
now
sit
down
and
eat
your
soup
and
i
stay
here
a
while
and
tell
you
all
about
her
i
gave
her
the
pansies
you
bought
her
it
was
so
sweet
of
you
too
larkie
it
must
have
taken
every
cent
of
your
money
did
it
i
suppose
you
ordered
them
over
the
telephone
since
you
would
leave
the
house
when
i
told
carol
you
got
them
for
her
she
took
them
in
her
hand
and
held
them
under
the
covers
of
course
they
wilted
right
away
but
i
knew
you
would
like
carrie
to
have
them
close
to
her
oh
you
must
eat
it
all
lark
it
looks
very
good
i
must
take
a
little
of
it
up
to
carol
maybe
she
can
eat
and
you
will
do
your
very
best
to
be
strong
and
bright
and
rosy
for
carol
wo
you
yes
i
will
i
go
and
run
across
the
field
a
few
times
before
i
go
to
bed
yes
i
try
my
very
best
then
she
looked
up
at
the
doctor
and
added
but
i
would
do
it
for
you
or
anybody
else
either
but
the
doctor
only
smiled
oddly
and
went
away
again
wondering
at
the
wisdom
that
god
has
placed
in
the
hearts
of
women
dreary
miserable
days
and
nights
followed
after
that
and
prudence
to
whom
carol
even
in
delirium
clung
with
such
wildness
that
they
dare
not
deny
her
grew
and
wan
but
when
the
doctor
putting
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
said
it
all
right
now
my
dear
soon
be
as
well
as
ever
then
prudence
dropped
limply
to
the
floor
trembling
weakly
with
the
great
happiness
good
methodist
friends
from
all
over
mount
mark
came
to
the
assistance
of
the
parsonage
family
and
many
gifts
and
delicacies
and
were
sent
in
to
tempt
the
appetite
of
the
invalid
and
the
others
as
well
you
all
need
toning
up
said
adams
crossly
you
all
gone
clear
under
a
body
would
think
the
whole
family
had
been
down
with
something
carol
friends
at
the
high
school
and
the
members
of
the
faculty
also
took
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
show
their
love
for
her
and
professor
duke
sent
clear
to
burlington
for
a
great
basket
of
violets
and
for
our
little
as
he
wrote
on
the
card
and
carol
dimpled
with
delight
as
she
read
it
now
you
see
for
yourself
prudence
she
declared
is
he
a
duck
when
the
little
parsonage
group
entire
gathered
once
more
around
the
table
in
the
real
they
were
joyful
indeed
it
was
a
gala
occasion
the
very
best
china
and
silverware
were
brought
out
in
carol
honor
the
supper
was
one
that
would
have
gratified
the
heart
of
a
bishop
at
the
very
least
apple
pie
with
pure
cream
carol
said
lark
ecstatically
for
apple
pie
with
pure
cream
was
the
favorite
dessert
of
the
twins
and
lark
added
earnestly
and
i
do
seem
to
be
very
hungry
carol
i
do
want
any
pie
you
shall
have
my
piece
too
i
said
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
you
remember
said
prudence
smiling
at
carol
but
my
mental
compass
indicated
connie
when
it
should
have
pointed
to
carol
and
i
do
hope
connie
dear
that
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
and
impress
upon
you
that
you
must
always
change
your
shoes
and
stockings
when
your
feet
are
wet
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
clear
laughter
rang
out
in
the
parsonage
chapter
ix
practising
economy
it
was
a
dull
dreary
day
early
in
december
prudence
and
fairy
were
sewing
in
the
bay
window
of
the
we
must
be
sure
to
have
all
the
scraps
out
of
the
way
before
connie
gets
home
said
prudence
carefully
fitting
together
pieces
of
a
dark
warm
furry
material
it
has
been
so
long
since
father
wore
this
coat
i
am
sure
she
will
not
recognize
it
but
she
will
ask
where
we
got
it
and
what
shall
we
say
we
must
tell
her
it
is
goods
we
have
had
in
the
house
for
a
long
time
that
is
true
and
i
made
this
fudge
on
purpose
to
distract
her
attention
if
she
begins
to
ask
questions
we
must
urge
her
to
have
more
candy
poor
child
she
added
very
sympathetically
her
heart
is
just
set
on
a
coat
i
know
she
will
be
bitterly
disappointed
if
the
members
would
just
pay
up
we
could
get
her
one
november
and
december
are
such
bad
months
for
parsonage
people
coal
to
buy
feed
for
the
cow
and
the
horse
and
the
chickens
and
sickness
and
larkie
teeth
of
course
those
last
are
not
regular
winter
expenses
but
they
took
a
lot
of
money
this
year
every
one
is
getting
ready
for
christmas
now
and
forgets
that
parsonage
people
need
christmas
money
too
november
and
december
are
always
my
bitter
months
fairy
bitter
months
fairy
took
a
pin
from
her
mouth
the
velvet
collar
and
cuffs
will
brighten
it
up
a
good
bit
it
really
a
pretty
material
i
have
honestly
been
ashamed
of
connie
the
last
few
sundays
it
was
so
cold
and
she
wore
only
that
little
thin
summer
jacket
she
must
have
been
half
frozen
oh
i
had
her
dressed
warmly
underneath
very
warmly
indeed
declared
prudence
but
no
matter
how
warm
you
are
underneath
you
look
cold
if
you
are
visibly
prepared
for
winter
weather
it
a
fortunate
thing
the
real
cold
weather
was
so
slow
in
coming
i
kept
hoping
enough
money
would
come
in
to
buy
her
a
coat
for
once
in
her
life
she
has
been
looking
forward
to
one
long
enough
put
in
fairy
this
will
be
a
bitter
blow
to
her
and
yet
it
is
not
such
a
coat
after
all
and
she
quickly
ran
up
a
seam
on
the
machine
here
comes
connie
prudence
hastily
swept
a
pile
of
scraps
out
of
sight
and
turned
to
greet
her
little
sister
with
a
cheery
smile
come
on
in
connie
she
cried
with
a
brightness
she
did
not
feel
fairy
and
i
are
making
you
a
new
coat
is
it
pretty
and
so
warm
see
the
nice
velvet
collar
and
cuffs
we
want
to
fit
it
on
you
right
away
dear
connie
picked
up
a
piece
of
the
goods
and
examined
it
intently
do
you
want
some
fudge
connie
exclaimed
fairy
shoving
the
dish
toward
her
hurriedly
connie
took
a
piece
from
the
plate
and
thrust
it
between
her
teeth
her
eyes
were
still
fastened
upon
the
brown
furry
cloth
where
did
you
get
this
stuff
she
inquired
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
speak
oh
we
had
it
in
the
house
quite
a
while
said
prudence
adding
swiftly
is
it
warm
connie
oh
it
does
look
nice
does
it
fairy
do
you
want
it
a
little
shorter
connie
or
is
that
about
right
about
right
i
guess
did
you
ever
have
a
coat
like
this
prudence
i
do
seem
to
remember
it
oh
no
it
was
mine
take
some
more
candy
connie
is
it
good
let
put
a
little
more
fullness
in
the
sleeves
fairy
more
stylish
this
the
collar
fits
very
nicely
the
velvet
gives
it
such
a
rich
tone
and
brown
is
so
becoming
to
you
thanks
said
connie
patiently
was
this
something
of
yours
fairy
oh
no
we
just
had
it
in
the
house
quite
a
while
it
comes
in
very
handy
right
now
does
it
it
make
you
such
a
serviceable
stylish
coat
is
it
about
time
for
the
twins
to
get
here
prudence
i
afraid
they
are
playing
along
the
road
those
girls
get
more
careless
every
day
of
their
lives
well
if
this
did
belong
to
one
of
you
whose
was
it
demanded
connie
i
know
the
twins
never
had
anything
like
this
it
looks
kind
of
familiar
to
me
where
did
it
come
from
out
of
the
trunk
in
the
garret
connie
do
you
want
some
more
fudge
i
put
a
lot
of
nuts
in
especially
on
your
account
it
good
said
connie
taking
another
piece
she
examined
the
cloth
very
closely
say
prudence
is
this
that
old
brown
coat
of
father
fairy
shoved
her
chair
back
from
the
machine
and
ran
to
the
window
look
prue
she
cried
is
that
adams
coming
this
way
i
wonder
no
it
is
answered
connie
gravely
it
just
miss
avery
getting
home
from
is
it
prudence
father
coat
i
mean
yes
connie
it
is
said
prudence
very
very
gently
but
no
one
here
has
seen
it
and
it
is
such
nice
cloth
just
exactly
what
girls
are
wearing
now
but
i
wanted
a
new
coat
connie
did
not
cry
she
stood
looking
at
prudence
with
her
wide
hurt
eyes
oh
connie
i
just
as
sorry
as
you
are
cried
prudence
with
starting
tears
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
dearest
but
the
people
did
pay
father
up
last
month
and
nothing
has
come
in
for
this
month
yet
and
we
had
so
much
extra
i
will
have
to
wear
my
old
shoes
too
connie
and
you
know
how
they
look
the
shoemaker
says
they
are
worth
fixing
so
i
must
wear
them
as
they
but
maybe
after
christmas
we
can
get
you
a
coat
they
pay
up
better
then
i
think
i
rather
wear
my
summer
coat
until
then
said
connie
soberly
oh
but
you
ca
dearest
it
is
too
cold
wo
you
be
a
good
girl
now
and
not
make
sister
feel
badly
about
it
it
really
is
becoming
to
you
and
it
is
nice
and
warm
you
know
parsonage
people
just
have
to
practise
economy
connie
it
ca
be
helped
take
some
more
fudge
dear
and
run
a
while
you
feel
better
about
it
presently
i
sure
connie
stood
solemnly
beside
the
table
her
eyes
still
fastened
on
the
coat
cut
down
from
her
father
can
i
go
and
take
a
walk
she
asked
finally
may
i
you
mean
suggested
fairy
yes
may
i
maybe
i
can
reconcile
myself
to
it
yes
do
go
and
take
a
walk
urged
prudence
promptly
eager
to
get
the
small
sober
face
beyond
her
range
of
vision
if
i
am
not
back
when
the
twins
get
home
go
right
on
and
eat
without
me
i
come
back
when
i
get
things
straightened
out
in
my
mind
when
connie
was
quite
beyond
hearing
prudence
dropped
her
head
on
the
table
and
wept
oh
fairy
if
the
members
just
knew
how
such
things
hurt
maybe
they
pay
up
a
little
better
how
do
they
expect
parsonage
people
to
keep
up
appearances
when
they
have
any
money
oh
now
prue
you
worse
than
connie
there
no
use
to
cry
about
it
parsonage
people
have
to
find
happiness
in
spite
of
financial
misery
money
is
the
first
thing
with
folks
like
us
no
but
they
have
pledged
it
protested
prudence
lifting
her
face
they
must
know
we
are
counting
on
the
money
why
do
they
keep
their
pledges
they
pay
their
meat
bills
and
grocery
bills
and
house
rent
why
do
they
pay
for
their
religion
now
prue
you
know
how
things
go
adams
is
having
a
lot
of
christmas
expense
and
she
thinks
her
four
dollars
a
month
wo
really
be
missed
she
thinks
she
will
make
it
up
along
in
february
when
christmas
is
over
but
she
forgets
that
barnaby
with
two
dollars
and
scott
with
five
and
walter
with
seven
and
holmes
with
three
and
about
thirty
others
with
one
dollar
each
are
thinking
the
same
thing
each
member
thinks
for
himself
and
takes
no
account
of
the
others
that
how
it
happens
prudence
squirmed
uncomfortably
in
her
chair
i
wish
you
mention
names
fairy
she
begged
i
do
not
object
to
lumping
them
in
a
body
and
wondering
about
them
but
i
ca
feel
right
about
calling
them
out
by
name
and
criticizing
besides
we
do
not
really
know
which
ones
they
are
who
did
not
pay
i
was
just
giving
names
for
illustrative
purposes
said
fairy
quickly
like
as
not
the
very
ones
i
named
are
the
ones
who
did
pay
well
get
this
stuff
out
of
the
way
and
let
set
the
table
somehow
i
ca
bear
to
touch
it
any
more
poor
little
connie
if
she
had
cried
about
it
i
would
have
cared
so
much
but
she
looked
so
heartsick
did
she
fairy
connie
certainly
was
heartsick
more
than
that
she
was
a
little
disgusted
she
felt
herself
aroused
to
take
action
things
had
gone
too
far
go
to
church
in
her
father
coat
she
could
not
but
they
had
the
money
if
connie
father
had
been
at
home
perhaps
they
might
have
reasoned
it
out
together
but
he
had
left
town
that
morning
and
would
not
be
home
until
saturday
evening
too
late
to
get
a
coat
in
time
for
sunday
and
prudence
had
said
that
connie
must
be
coated
by
sunday
she
walked
sturdily
down
the
street
toward
the
city
ironically
so
called
her
face
was
stony
her
hands
were
clenched
but
finally
she
brightened
her
lagging
steps
quickened
she
skipped
along
quite
cheerfully
she
turned
westward
as
she
reached
the
corner
of
the
square
and
walked
along
that
business
street
with
shining
eyes
in
front
of
the
first
national
bank
she
paused
but
after
a
few
seconds
she
passed
by
on
the
opposite
corner
was
another
bank
when
she
reached
it
she
walked
in
without
pausing
and
the
massive
door
swung
behind
her
standing
on
tiptoe
she
confronted
the
cashier
with
a
grave
face
is
harold
in
she
asked
politely
harold
was
the
president
of
the
bank
it
was
a
little
unusual
yes
he
is
in
said
the
cashier
doubtfully
but
he
is
very
busy
will
you
tell
him
that
constance
starr
wishes
to
speak
to
him
privately
and
that
it
is
very
important
the
cashier
smiled
the
methodist
minister
little
girl
is
it
yes
i
will
tell
him
harold
looked
up
impatiently
at
the
interruption
it
the
methodist
minister
little
daughter
and
she
says
it
is
important
for
her
to
speak
to
you
privately
oh
probably
a
message
from
her
father
bring
her
in
harold
was
one
of
the
trustees
of
the
methodist
church
and
prominent
among
them
his
keen
eyes
were
intent
upon
connie
as
she
walked
in
but
she
did
not
falter
how
do
you
do
mr
harold
she
said
and
shook
hands
with
him
in
the
good
old
methodist
way
his
eyes
twinkled
but
he
spoke
briskly
did
your
father
send
you
on
an
errand
no
father
is
out
of
town
i
came
on
business
personal
business
harold
it
is
my
own
affair
oh
i
see
and
he
smiled
at
the
earnest
little
face
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
miss
constance
i
want
to
borrow
five
dollars
from
the
bank
mr
harold
you
did
prudence
send
you
oh
no
it
is
my
own
affair
as
i
told
you
i
came
on
my
own
account
i
thought
of
stopping
at
the
other
bank
as
i
passed
but
then
i
remembered
that
parsonage
people
must
always
do
business
with
their
own
members
if
possible
and
of
course
i
would
rather
come
to
you
than
to
a
perfect
stranger
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
five
dollars
you
say
you
want
i
suppose
i
had
better
tell
you
all
about
it
you
see
i
need
a
winter
coat
very
badly
oh
very
badly
indeed
the
girls
were
ashamed
of
me
last
sunday
i
looked
so
cold
outside
though
i
was
dressed
plenty
warm
enough
inside
i
been
looking
forward
to
a
new
coat
harold
i
never
had
one
yet
there
was
always
something
to
cut
down
for
me
from
prudence
or
fairy
or
the
twins
but
this
time
there
was
anything
to
hand
down
and
so
i
just
naturally
counted
on
a
new
one
connie
paused
and
looked
embarrassed
yes
his
voice
was
encouraging
well
i
tell
you
the
rest
but
i
hope
you
wo
say
anything
about
it
for
i
feel
pretty
cheap
if
i
thought
all
the
folks
knew
about
you
see
the
members
need
such
a
lot
of
money
now
just
before
christmas
and
so
they
did
pay
us
up
last
month
and
they
have
paid
anything
this
month
and
we
had
to
get
coal
and
feed
and
larkie
teeth
had
to
be
fixed
and
carol
was
sick
you
remember
seems
to
me
lark
teeth
might
have
been
put
off
until
after
christmas
but
prudence
says
and
so
there
is
any
money
left
and
i
have
a
coat
but
prudence
and
fairy
are
making
me
one
out
of
an
old
coat
of
father
constance
paused
dramatically
harold
never
even
smiled
he
just
nodded
understandingly
i
do
think
i
could
wear
a
coat
of
to
church
it
cut
down
of
course
but
there
something
painful
about
the
idea
i
would
expect
father
to
wear
any
of
my
clothes
you
can
see
how
it
is
harold
just
imagine
how
you
would
feel
wearing
your
wife
coat
i
do
think
i
could
listen
to
the
sermons
i
do
believe
i
could
be
thankful
for
the
mercy
of
wearing
coat
i
do
see
anything
merciful
about
it
do
you
harold
did
not
speak
he
gazed
at
connie
sympathetically
and
shook
his
head
it
too
much
that
what
it
is
and
so
i
thought
i
just
have
to
take
things
into
my
own
hands
and
borrow
the
money
i
can
get
a
good
coat
for
five
dollars
but
if
the
bank
is
a
little
short
right
now
i
can
get
along
with
four
or
even
three
i
rather
have
the
cheapest
coat
in
town
than
one
made
out
of
father
do
you
think
you
can
let
me
have
it
yes
indeed
we
can
he
seemed
to
find
his
voice
with
an
effort
of
course
we
can
we
are
very
glad
to
lend
our
money
to
responsible
people
we
are
proud
to
have
your
trade
but
i
must
tell
you
that
it
may
take
me
quite
a
while
to
pay
it
back
father
gives
me
a
nickel
a
week
and
i
generally
spend
it
for
candy
there
another
nickel
but
it
has
to
go
in
the
collection
so
i
really
count
that
i
do
believe
father
would
let
me
neglect
the
heathen
even
to
pay
for
a
winter
coat
but
i
will
give
you
the
nickel
every
week
and
at
that
rate
i
can
pay
it
back
in
a
couple
of
years
easy
enough
but
i
rather
give
the
nickels
as
fast
as
i
get
them
it
so
hard
to
keep
money
when
you
can
get
your
hand
on
it
you
know
sometimes
i
have
quite
a
lot
of
money
as
much
as
a
quarter
at
a
time
from
doing
errands
for
the
neighbors
and
things
like
that
i
pay
you
as
fast
as
i
can
will
that
be
all
right
and
the
interest
too
of
course
how
much
will
the
interest
be
on
five
dollars
well
that
depends
on
how
soon
you
repay
the
money
connie
but
figure
it
out
and
tell
you
later
all
right
i
know
i
can
trust
you
not
to
cheat
me
since
you
a
trustee
so
i
wo
worry
about
that
harold
drew
out
a
bulky
book
from
his
pocket
and
handed
connie
a
crisp
new
bill
her
eyes
sparkled
as
she
received
it
but
connie
he
continued
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
give
you
this
we
methodists
have
done
a
wicked
thing
in
forgetting
our
november
payments
and
i
will
just
give
you
this
bill
to
make
up
for
it
but
connie
shook
her
head
decidedly
oh
no
i
have
to
give
it
back
then
father
would
not
stand
that
not
for
one
minute
of
course
parsonage
people
get
things
given
to
them
quite
a
lot
and
it
a
good
thing
too
i
must
say
but
we
do
hint
for
them
harold
that
would
be
right
she
held
out
the
bill
toward
him
with
very
manifest
reluctance
keep
it
we
call
it
a
loan
then
connie
he
said
and
you
may
pay
me
back
five
cents
at
a
time
just
as
is
most
convenient
the
four
older
girls
were
at
the
table
when
connie
arrived
she
exhaled
quiet
satisfaction
from
every
pore
prudence
glanced
at
her
once
and
then
looked
away
again
she
has
reconciled
herself
she
thought
dinner
was
half
over
before
constance
burst
her
bomb
she
had
intended
waiting
until
they
were
quite
through
but
it
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
keep
are
you
going
to
be
busy
this
afternoon
prudence
she
asked
quietly
we
are
going
to
sew
a
little
said
prudence
why
i
wanted
you
to
go
with
me
after
school
well
perhaps
i
can
do
that
fairy
will
be
able
to
finish
the
coat
alone
you
need
finish
the
coat
i
ca
wear
father
coat
to
church
prudence
it
a
it
a
physical
impossibility
the
twins
laughed
fairy
smiled
but
prudence
gazed
at
the
baby
with
tender
pity
i
so
sorry
dearest
but
we
have
the
money
to
buy
one
now
will
five
dollars
be
enough
inquired
connie
and
she
placed
her
crisp
new
bill
beside
her
plate
the
twins
gasped
they
gazed
at
connie
with
new
respect
they
were
just
wishing
they
could
handle
bills
so
recklessly
will
you
loan
me
twenty
dollars
until
after
christmas
connie
queried
fairy
but
prudence
asked
where
did
you
get
this
money
connie
i
borrowed
it
from
the
bank
connie
replied
with
proper
gravity
i
have
two
years
to
pay
it
back
harold
says
they
are
proud
to
have
my
trade
prudence
was
silent
for
several
long
seconds
then
she
inquired
in
a
low
voice
did
you
tell
him
why
you
wanted
it
yes
i
explained
the
whole
situation
what
did
he
say
he
said
he
knew
just
how
i
felt
because
he
knew
he
could
go
to
church
in
his
wife
no
i
said
that
myself
but
he
agreed
with
me
he
did
not
say
very
much
but
he
looked
sympathetic
he
said
he
anticipated
great
pleasure
in
seeing
me
in
my
new
coat
at
church
next
sunday
go
on
with
your
luncheon
twins
said
prudence
sternly
you
be
late
to
we
see
about
going
when
you
get
home
connie
now
eat
your
luncheon
and
do
talk
about
coats
any
more
when
connie
had
gone
back
to
school
prudence
went
straight
to
harold
bank
flushed
and
embarrassed
she
explained
the
situation
frankly
my
sympathies
are
all
with
connie
she
said
candidly
but
i
am
afraid
father
would
not
like
it
we
are
dead
set
against
borrowing
after
our
mother
was
taken
we
were
crowded
pretty
close
for
money
so
we
had
to
go
in
debt
it
took
us
two
years
to
get
it
paid
father
and
fairy
and
i
talked
it
over
then
and
decided
we
would
starve
rather
than
borrow
again
even
the
twins
understood
it
but
connie
was
too
little
she
does
know
how
heartbreaking
it
is
to
keep
handing
over
every
cent
for
debt
when
one
is
just
yearning
for
other
i
do
wish
she
might
have
the
coat
but
i
afraid
father
would
not
like
it
she
gave
me
the
five
dollars
for
safekeeping
and
i
have
brought
it
back
harold
shook
his
head
no
connie
must
have
her
coat
this
will
be
a
good
lesson
for
her
it
will
teach
her
the
bitterness
of
living
under
debt
besides
prudence
i
think
in
my
heart
that
she
is
right
this
time
this
is
a
case
where
borrowing
is
justified
get
her
the
coat
and
i
square
the
account
with
your
father
then

chapter
x
a
burglar
visit
prue
a
small
hand
gripped
prudence
shoulder
and
again
came
a
hoarsely
whispered
prue
prudence
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
bounce
what
in
the
world
she
began
gazing
out
into
the
room
by
the
moonshine
and
seeing
carol
and
lark
shivering
beside
her
bed
sh
sh
hush
whispered
lark
there
a
burglar
in
our
room
by
this
time
even
fairy
was
awake
oh
there
is
she
scoffed
yes
there
is
declared
carol
with
some
heat
we
heard
him
plain
as
day
he
stepped
into
the
closet
did
he
lark
he
certainly
did
agreed
lark
did
you
see
him
no
we
heard
him
carol
heard
him
first
and
she
spoke
and
nudged
me
then
i
heard
him
too
he
was
at
our
dresser
but
he
shot
across
the
room
and
into
the
closet
he
closed
the
door
after
him
there
now
you
been
dreaming
said
fairy
lying
down
again
we
do
generally
dream
the
same
thing
at
the
same
minute
said
carol
stormily
i
tell
you
he
in
there
and
you
two
great
big
girls
came
off
and
left
poor
little
connie
in
there
alone
with
a
burglar
did
you
well
you
are
nice
ones
i
must
say
and
prudence
leaped
out
of
bed
and
started
for
the
door
followed
by
fairy
with
the
twins
creeping
fearfully
along
in
the
rear
she
was
asleep
muttered
carol
we
did
want
to
scare
her
added
lark
prudence
was
careful
to
turn
the
switch
by
the
door
so
that
the
room
was
in
full
light
before
she
entered
the
closet
door
was
wide
open
connie
was
soundly
sleeping
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
you
see
said
prudence
sternly
i
bet
he
took
our
ruby
rings
declared
lark
and
the
twins
and
fairy
ran
to
the
dresser
to
look
but
a
sickening
realization
had
come
home
to
prudence
in
the
lower
hall
under
the
staircase
was
a
small
dark
closet
which
they
called
the
dungeon
the
dungeon
door
was
big
and
solid
and
was
equipped
with
a
heavy
in
this
dungeon
prudence
kept
the
family
silverware
and
all
the
money
she
had
on
hand
as
it
could
there
be
safely
locked
away
but
more
often
than
not
prudence
forgot
to
lock
it
starr
had
gone
to
burlington
that
morning
to
attend
special
revival
services
for
three
days
and
prudence
had
fifty
whole
dollars
in
the
house
an
unwonted
sum
in
that
parsonage
and
the
dungeon
was
not
locked
without
a
word
she
slipped
softly
out
of
the
room
ran
down
the
stairs
making
never
a
sound
in
her
bare
feet
and
saw
somewhat
to
her
surprise
that
the
dungeon
door
was
open
quickly
she
flung
it
shut
pushed
the
tiny
key
that
moved
the
catch
and
was
rushing
up
the
stairs
again
with
never
a
pause
for
breath
a
strange
sight
met
her
eyes
in
the
twins
room
the
twins
themselves
were
in
each
other
arms
sobbing
bitterly
fairy
was
still
looking
hurriedly
through
the
dresser
drawers
they
are
gone
wailed
carol
our
beautiful
ruby
rings
that
belonged
to
grandmother
nonsense
cried
prue
with
nervous
anger
you
left
them
in
the
bathroom
or
on
the
kitchen
shelves
you
always
leaving
them
somewhere
over
the
place
come
on
and
we
search
the
house
just
to
convince
you
no
no
shrieked
the
twins
let
lock
the
door
and
get
under
the
bed
the
rings
were
really
valuable
their
grandmother
their
mother
whom
they
had
never
seen
had
divided
her
real
jewelry
between
her
two
daughters
and
the
mother
of
these
parsonage
girls
had
further
divided
her
portion
to
make
it
reach
through
her
own
family
of
girls
prudence
had
a
small
but
beautiful
chain
of
tiny
pearls
fairy
share
consisted
of
a
handsome
brooch
with
a
diamond
in
the
center
the
twin
rubies
of
another
brooch
had
been
reset
in
rings
for
carol
and
lark
and
were
the
priceless
treasures
of
their
lives
and
in
the
dungeon
was
a
solid
gold
bracelet
waiting
until
connie
arm
should
be
sufficiently
developed
to
do
it
justice
our
rings
our
rings
the
twins
were
wailing
and
connie
awakened
by
the
noise
was
crying
beneath
the
covers
of
her
bed
maybe
we
better
phone
for
allan
suggested
fairy
the
girls
are
so
nervous
they
will
be
hysterical
by
the
time
we
finish
searching
the
house
well
let
do
the
then
said
prudence
get
your
slippers
and
kimonos
and
we
go
into
daddy
room
but
inside
the
door
of
daddy
room
with
the
younger
girls
clinging
to
her
and
fairy
looking
odd
and
disturbed
prudence
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
about
the
room
curiously
fairy
did
father
leave
his
watch
hanging
on
that
nail
by
the
table
seems
to
me
i
saw
it
there
this
morning
i
remember
thinking
i
would
tease
him
for
being
forgetful
and
the
watch
was
not
there
i
think
it
was
sunday
he
left
it
answered
fairy
in
a
low
voice
i
remember
seeing
it
on
the
nail
and
thinking
he
would
need
it
but
i
believe
it
was
sunday
prudence
looked
under
the
bed
and
in
the
closet
but
their
room
was
empty
should
they
go
farther
for
a
moment
the
girls
stood
looking
at
one
another
questioningly
then
they
heard
a
loud
thud
as
of
some
one
pounding
on
a
door
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
some
one
was
in
the
house
connie
and
the
twins
screamed
again
and
clung
to
prudence
frantically
and
fairy
said
i
think
better
lock
the
door
and
stay
right
here
until
morning
prue
but
prudence
faced
them
stubbornly
if
you
think
i
going
to
let
any
one
steal
that
fifty
dollars
you
are
mistaken
fifty
dollars
does
not
come
often
enough
for
that
i
can
tell
you
it
probably
stolen
already
objected
fairy
well
if
it
is
we
find
out
who
did
it
and
have
them
arrested
i
going
down
to
telephone
to
the
police
you
girls
must
lock
the
door
after
me
and
stay
right
here
the
little
ones
screamed
again
and
fairy
said
do
be
silly
prue
if
you
go
i
going
with
you
of
course
we
leave
the
kiddies
here
and
they
can
lock
the
door
they
be
perfectly
safe
in
here
but
the
children
loudly
objected
to
this
if
prue
and
fairy
went
they
would
go
so
down
the
stairs
they
trooped
a
timorous
trembling
crowd
prudence
went
at
once
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
residence
of
the
allans
their
neighbors
across
the
street
after
a
seemingly
wait
the
neighbor
left
his
bed
to
answer
the
insistent
telephone
falteringly
prudence
explained
their
predicament
and
asked
him
to
come
and
search
the
house
he
promised
to
be
there
in
five
minutes
with
his
son
to
help
now
said
prudence
more
cheerfully
we
just
go
out
to
the
kitchen
and
wait
it
quiet
there
and
away
from
the
rest
of
the
house
and
we
be
perfectly
safe
to
the
kitchen
then
they
hurried
and
found
real
comfort
in
its
smallness
and
secureness
prudence
raked
up
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
and
fairy
drew
the
blinds
to
their
lowest
limits
the
twins
and
connie
trailed
them
fearfully
at
every
step
when
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
prudence
spoke
with
great
assurance
i
just
run
in
to
the
dungeon
and
see
for
sure
if
the
money
is
there
i
do
not
honestly
believe
there
is
a
soul
in
the
house
but
i
ca
rest
until
i
know
that
money
is
safe
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
fairy
you
stay
right
here
and
wait
with
us
i
do
not
believe
there
any
one
in
the
house
either
but
if
there
is
you
sha
run
into
him
by
yourself
you
stay
right
where
you
are
and
do
be
silly
allan
will
do
the
investigating
every
breath
of
wind
against
the
windows
drew
startled
cries
from
the
younger
girls
and
both
fairy
and
prudence
were
white
with
anxiety
when
they
heard
the
loud
voices
of
the
allans
outside
the
kitchen
door
prudence
began
crying
nervously
the
moment
the
two
angels
of
mercy
appeared
before
her
and
fairy
told
their
tale
of
woe
well
there
now
allan
said
with
rough
sympathy
you
just
got
scared
that
all
everything
suspicious
when
folks
get
scared
i
told
my
wife
the
other
day
i
bet
you
girls
would
get
a
good
fright
some
time
left
here
alone
come
on
jim
and
we
go
over
the
house
in
a
jiffy
he
was
standing
near
the
door
he
lifted
his
head
suddenly
and
seemed
to
sniff
a
little
there
was
undoubtedly
a
faint
odor
of
tobacco
in
the
house
been
any
men
in
here
he
asked
or
this
afternoon
think
now
no
one
answered
prudence
i
was
alone
all
afternoon
and
there
has
been
no
one
in
this
evening
he
passed
slowly
through
the
into
the
hall
closely
followed
by
his
son
and
the
five
girls
already
much
reassured
as
he
passed
the
dungeon
door
he
paused
for
a
moment
listening
intently
his
head
bent
oh
allan
cried
prudence
let
look
in
the
dungeon
first
i
want
to
see
if
the
money
is
safe
her
hand
was
already
on
the
lock
but
he
shoved
her
away
quickly
is
there
any
way
out
of
that
closet
besides
this
door
he
asked
no
we
call
it
the
dungeon
laughed
prudence
her
quite
recovered
it
is
right
under
the
stairs
and
not
even
a
mouse
could
gnaw
its
way
out
with
this
door
shut
who
shut
that
door
he
inquired
still
holding
prudence
hand
from
the
lock
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
went
on
let
go
back
in
the
other
room
a
minute
come
on
all
of
you
in
the
he
hurried
to
the
telephone
and
spoke
to
the
operator
in
a
low
voice
call
the
police
headquarters
and
have
them
send
two
or
three
men
to
the
methodist
parsonage
right
away
we
got
a
burglar
locked
in
a
closet
and
they
have
to
get
him
out
please
hurry
at
this
the
girls
crowded
around
him
again
in
renewed
fear
do
be
scared
he
said
calmly
we
all
right
he
in
there
safe
enough
and
ca
get
out
for
a
while
now
tell
me
about
it
how
did
you
get
him
in
the
closet
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
all
about
it
carol
began
the
story
with
keen
relish
i
woke
up
and
thought
i
heard
some
one
in
the
room
i
supposed
it
was
prudence
i
said
and
nobody
answered
and
everything
was
quiet
but
i
felt
there
was
some
one
in
there
i
nudged
lark
and
she
woke
up
he
moved
then
and
we
both
heard
him
he
was
fumbling
at
the
dresser
and
our
ruby
rings
are
gone
we
heard
him
step
across
the
room
and
into
the
closet
he
closed
the
door
after
him
did
he
lark
yes
he
did
agreed
lark
his
hand
was
on
the
knob
so
we
sneaked
out
of
bed
and
went
into
prudence
room
and
woke
her
and
fairy
she
looked
at
connie
and
blushed
connie
was
asleep
and
we
did
waken
her
because
we
did
want
to
frighten
her
we
woke
the
girls
and
you
tell
the
rest
prudence
we
did
believe
her
of
course
we
went
back
into
their
room
and
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
rings
were
gone
while
they
were
looking
at
the
dresser
i
remembered
that
i
forgot
to
lock
the
dungeon
door
where
we
keep
the
money
and
the
silverware
and
i
ran
and
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
and
went
back
up
i
did
hear
a
sound
allan
laughed
heartily
well
your
burglar
was
in
that
closet
after
the
money
no
doubt
and
he
did
hear
you
coming
and
got
locked
in
did
you
make
any
noise
coming
down
the
stairs
no
i
was
in
my
bare
feet
and
i
tried
to
be
quiet
because
if
there
was
any
one
in
the
house
i
did
not
want
him
coming
at
me
in
the
dark
i
ran
back
and
we
looked
in
father
room
i
thought
father
had
forgotten
to
take
his
watch
with
him
but
it
was
do
you
really
think
it
was
sunday
he
forgot
it
fairy
no
said
fairy
it
was
there
this
afternoon
the
burglar
got
it
in
the
dungeon
with
him
of
i
just
said
it
was
sunday
to
keep
from
scaring
the
twins
in
a
few
minutes
they
heard
footsteps
around
the
house
and
knew
the
officers
had
arrived
allan
let
them
into
the
house
four
of
them
and
led
them
out
to
the
hall
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
burglar
was
in
the
dungeon
he
had
been
busy
with
his
knife
and
the
lock
was
nearly
removed
if
the
officers
had
been
two
minutes
later
the
dungeon
would
have
been
empty
the
girls
were
sent
at
once
with
the
allan
boy
as
guard
as
guard
without
regard
for
the
fact
that
he
was
probably
more
frightened
than
any
one
of
them
the
chief
officer
rapped
briskly
on
the
dungeon
door
then
he
clicked
his
revolver
there
are
enough
of
us
to
overpower
three
of
you
he
said
curtly
and
we
have
men
outside
the
house
too
if
you
make
any
disturbance
we
shall
all
fire
the
instant
the
door
is
opened
if
you
put
your
firearms
on
the
floor
and
hold
both
hands
over
your
head
you
be
well
treated
if
your
hands
are
not
up
we
fire
on
sight
get
your
revolvers
ready
boys
then
the
officer
opened
the
door
evidently
the
burglar
was
wise
enough
to
appreciate
the
futility
of
fighting
against
odds
perhaps
he
did
not
wish
to
add
the
charge
of
manslaughter
to
that
of
robbery
certainly
he
did
not
feel
himself
called
to
sudden
death
at
any
rate
his
hands
were
above
his
head
and
in
less
than
a
second
he
was
securely
manacled
the
chief
officer
had
been
eying
him
closely
say
he
exclaimed
are
you
grant
the
burglar
grinned
but
did
not
answer
by
jove
shouted
the
officer
it
is
call
the
girls
down
here
he
ordered
and
when
they
appeared
gazing
at
the
burglar
with
mingled
admiration
pity
and
fear
he
congratulated
them
with
considerable
excitement
it
grant
he
explained
there
a
reward
of
five
hundred
dollars
for
him
you
get
the
money
as
sure
as
born
then
he
turned
again
to
the
burglar
say
grant
what
a
fellow
like
you
doing
on
such
a
job
as
this
a
methodist
parsonage
is
not
just
in
your
line
is
it
laughed
sheepishly
well
he
explained
chicago
got
too
hot
for
me
i
had
to
get
out
in
a
hurry
and
i
could
get
my
hands
on
any
money
i
had
a
fine
lot
of
jewels
but
i
was
so
pushed
i
could
use
them
i
came
here
and
loafed
around
town
for
a
while
because
folks
said
mount
mark
was
so
fast
asleep
it
did
not
even
wake
up
long
enough
to
read
the
daily
papers
i
heard
about
this
parsonage
bunch
and
knew
the
old
man
had
gone
off
to
get
more
religion
this
afternoon
at
the
station
i
saw
a
detective
from
chicago
get
off
the
train
and
i
knew
what
that
meant
but
i
needed
some
cash
and
so
i
was
above
a
little
job
on
the
side
i
never
dreamed
of
getting
done
up
by
a
bunch
of
preacher
kids
i
went
upstairs
to
get
those
family
jewels
i
heard
about
and
one
of
the
little
ones
gave
the
alarm
i
already
had
some
of
them
so
i
came
down
at
once
i
stopped
in
the
dungeon
to
get
that
money
and
first
thing
i
knew
the
door
banged
shut
that
all
you
welcome
to
the
five
hundred
dollars
ladies
some
one
was
bound
to
get
it
sooner
or
later
and
partial
to
the
ladies
every
time
grant
was
a
modern
thief
of
the
new
class
at
that
moment
in
chicago
he
had
in
storage
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewels
which
he
could
not
dispose
of
on
the
pressure
of
the
moment
the
law
was
crowding
him
close
and
he
was
obliged
to
choose
between
meeting
the
law
or
running
away
from
it
he
ran
he
reached
mount
mark
and
trusted
to
its
drowsiness
for
concealment
for
a
few
weeks
but
that
afternoon
the
arrival
of
a
detective
gave
him
warning
and
he
planned
his
departure
promptly
a
parsonage
occupied
by
only
five
girls
held
no
terrors
for
him
and
with
fifty
dollars
and
a
few
fairly
good
jewels
a
man
of
his
talent
could
accomplish
wonders
but
mount
mark
had
aroused
from
its
lethargy
grant
was
in
the
hands
of
the
law
starr
had
been
greatly
interested
in
the
accounts
of
the
evangelistic
services
being
held
in
burlington
the
workers
were
meeting
with
marked
success
and
starr
felt
he
should
get
in
touch
with
them
so
on
thursday
morning
he
took
the
early
train
to
burlington
there
he
sought
out
a
conveniently
located
hotel
and
took
up
residence
he
attended
the
services
at
the
tabernacle
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
and
then
went
to
bed
at
the
hotel
he
slept
late
the
next
morning
when
he
finally
appeared
he
noticed
casually
without
giving
it
thought
that
the
clerk
behind
the
desk
looked
at
him
with
marked
interest
starr
nodded
cheerfully
and
the
clerk
came
at
once
from
behind
the
desk
to
speak
to
him
two
or
three
other
guests
who
had
been
lounging
about
drew
near
we
just
been
reading
about
your
girls
sir
said
the
clerk
respectfully
it
a
pretty
nervy
little
bunch
you
must
be
proud
of
them
my
girls
ejaculated
starr
have
you
seen
the
morning
paper
you
starr
the
methodist
minister
at
mount
mark
are
you
i
am
but
what
has
happened
to
my
girls
is
anything
wrong
give
me
the
paper
starr
was
greatly
agitated
he
showed
it
but
the
clerk
could
not
lose
this
opportunity
to
create
a
sensation
it
was
a
chance
of
a
why
a
burglar
got
in
the
parsonage
last
night
he
began
almost
licking
his
lips
with
satisfaction
the
twins
heard
him
at
their
dresser
and
when
he
stepped
into
the
closet
they
locked
him
in
there
and
yelled
for
the
rest
of
the
family
but
he
broke
away
from
them
and
went
and
climbed
down
into
the
dungeon
to
get
the
money
then
prudence
she
ran
alone
in
the
dark
and
locked
him
in
the
dungeon
pushed
him
or
something
like
that
i
believe
and
then
telephoned
for
the
police
and
she
stayed
on
guard
outside
the
dungeon
until
the
police
got
there
so
he
could
get
away
and
the
police
got
him
and
found
it
was
grant
a
famous
gentleman
thief
and
your
girls
are
going
to
get
five
hundred
dollars
reward
for
catching
him
five
minutes
later
starr
and
his
were
in
a
taxicab
speeding
toward
union
station
and
within
eight
minutes
he
was
en
route
for
mount
mark
white
in
the
face
shaky
in
the
knees
but
tremendously
proud
in
spirit
arriving
at
mount
mark
he
was
instantly
surrounded
by
an
exclamatory
crowd
of
station
loungers
ride
sir
glad
to
take
you
home
for
nothing
urged
harvey
reel
mount
mark
was
enjoying
more
notoriety
than
ever
before
in
the
two
hundred
years
of
its
existence
the
name
of
prudence
was
upon
every
tongue
and
her
father
heard
it
with
satisfaction
in
the
parsonage
he
found
at
least
of
the
ladies
aid
society
the
trustees
and
the
superintendent
along
with
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
ordinary
members
mixed
up
with
presbyterians
baptists
and
a
few
unclassified
outsiders
and
prudence
was
the
center
of
attraction
she
was
telling
the
whole
story
for
perhaps
the
fifteenth
time
that
morning
but
she
broke
off
when
her
father
hurried
in
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
oh
papa
she
cried
they
must
praise
me
i
had
no
idea
there
was
a
burglar
in
the
house
when
i
ran
down
the
stairs
and
if
i
had
been
careless
and
left
the
dungeon
unlocked
the
money
would
have
been
in
no
danger
and
if
the
twins
had
wakened
me
i
would
have
known
there
was
a
burglar
about
the
place
and
if
fairy
had
kept
me
from
rushing
out
to
the
dungeon
to
see
if
the
money
was
safe
he
would
have
got
away
and
it
took
the
policemen
to
get
him
out
oh
i
know
that
is
not
very
grammatical
father
but
it
just
as
true
as
if
it
were
and
i
honestly
ca
see
that
much
credit
is
due
me
but
mount
mark
did
not
take
it
so
calmly
and
as
for
the
methodist
church
well
the
presbyterian
people
used
to
say
there
was
no
living
with
those
methodists
since
the
girls
caught
a
burglar
in
the
parsonage
of
course
it
was
important
from
the
methodist
point
of
view
pictures
of
the
parsonage
and
the
church
were
in
all
the
papers
for
miles
around
and
at
their
very
next
meeting
the
trustees
decided
to
get
the
piano
the
had
been
needing
for
the
last
hundred
years
when
the
five
hundred
dollars
arrived
from
chicago
prudence
felt
that
personally
she
had
no
real
right
to
the
money
we
must
divide
it
she
insisted
for
i
did
earn
it
a
bit
more
than
any
of
the
others
but
it
is
perfectly
glorious
to
have
five
hundred
dollars
is
it
did
you
ever
have
five
hundred
dollars
before
just
take
it
father
and
use
it
for
whatever
we
need
it
family
money
but
he
would
not
hear
of
this
no
he
said
put
it
in
the
bank
prudence
for
there
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
want
money
very
badly
then
you
will
have
it
let
divide
it
then
a
hundred
for
each
of
us
she
urged
neither
the
younger
girls
nor
their
father
would
consent
to
this
but
when
prudence
stood
very
firm
and
pleaded
with
them
earnestly
they
decided
to
divide
it
i
will
deposit
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
the
four
younger
ones
he
said
and
that
will
leave
you
as
much
so
it
was
settled
and
prudence
was
a
happy
girl
when
she
saw
it
safely
put
away
in
the
bank
we
can
get
it
whenever
we
really
need
it
you
know
she
told
her
father
joyfully
it
such
a
comfort
to
know
it
there
i
feel
just
like
a
millionaire
i
am
sure
do
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
to
send
grant
a
letter
of
thanks
for
it
we
were
horribly
scared
but
well
i
for
one
am
willing
to
be
horribly
scared
for
such
a
lot
of
money
as
that
chapter
xi
romance
comes
sometimes
methodists
or
presbyterians
or
heretics
whatever
we
may
be
we
are
irresistibly
impelled
to
the
conclusion
that
things
were
simply
bound
to
happen
however
slight
the
cause
still
that
cause
was
predestined
from
the
beginning
of
time
a
girl
may
by
the
sheerest
accident
step
from
the
a
block
ahead
of
her
destination
an
irritating
incident
but
as
she
walks
that
block
she
may
meet
an
friend
and
a
stranger
and
that
stranger
ah
you
can
never
convince
the
girl
that
her
stepping
from
the
car
too
soon
was
not
ordered
when
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
laid
even
so
with
prudence
good
methodist
daughter
that
she
was
we
ask
her
what
if
you
had
not
gone
out
for
a
ride
that
morning
and
prudence
laughing
answers
oh
but
i
had
to
go
you
see
well
we
continue
if
you
had
not
met
him
that
way
you
could
have
met
him
some
other
way
i
suppose
oh
no
declares
prudence
decidedly
it
had
to
happen
just
that
way
after
all
down
in
plain
ink
on
plain
paper
it
was
very
simple
across
the
street
from
the
parsonage
was
a
little
white
cottage
set
back
among
tall
cedars
in
this
cottage
lived
a
girl
named
mattie
moore
a
common
unlovely
unexciting
girl
with
whom
romance
could
not
apparently
be
intimately
concerned
mattie
moore
taught
a
country
school
five
miles
out
from
town
and
she
rode
to
and
from
her
school
morning
and
evening
on
a
bicycle
years
before
when
prudence
was
young
and
bicycles
were
fashionable
she
had
been
intensely
fond
of
riding
but
as
she
gained
in
age
and
bicycles
lost
in
popularity
she
discarded
the
amusement
as
unworthy
a
parsonage
damsel
one
evening
early
in
june
when
the
world
was
fair
to
look
upon
it
was
foreordained
that
prudence
should
be
turning
in
at
the
parsonage
gate
just
as
mattie
moore
whirled
up
opposite
on
her
dusty
wheel
prudence
stopped
to
interchange
polite
inanities
with
her
neighbor
and
mattie
wheeling
the
bicycle
lightly
beside
her
came
across
the
street
and
stood
beneath
the
parsonage
maples
with
prudence
they
talked
of
the
weather
of
the
coming
summer
of
mattie
school
rejoicing
that
one
more
week
would
bring
freedom
from
books
for
mattie
and
the
younger
parsonage
girls
then
said
prudence
seemingly
of
her
own
free
will
but
really
directed
by
an
providence
is
it
great
fun
to
ride
a
bicycle
i
love
it
sometime
will
you
let
me
ride
your
wheel
why
certainly
you
may
ride
now
if
you
like
no
said
prudence
slowly
i
am
afraid
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
ride
now
some
of
the
members
might
see
me
and
well
i
am
very
grown
up
you
of
course
she
added
hastily
it
is
different
with
you
you
ride
for
business
but
it
would
be
nothing
but
a
frolic
with
me
i
want
to
get
up
at
six
and
go
early
in
the
morning
when
the
world
is
fast
asleep
let
me
take
it
morning
will
you
it
is
saturday
and
you
wo
be
going
to
school
yes
of
course
you
may
was
the
hearty
answer
you
may
stay
out
as
long
as
you
like
i
going
to
sew
you
make
take
it
in
the
parsonage
now
and
keep
it
until
morning
i
always
sleep
late
on
saturdays
so
prudence
delightedly
tripped
up
the
parsonage
board
walk
wheeling
the
bicycle
by
her
side
she
hid
it
carefully
in
the
woodshed
for
the
twins
were
rash
and
venturesome
but
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
she
confided
her
plan
to
fairy
i
going
at
six
and
i
be
back
in
time
to
get
breakfast
but
as
you
know
fairy
my
plans
do
not
always
work
out
as
i
intend
so
if
i
am
a
little
late
you
get
breakfast
for
papa
and
the
girls
like
a
dear
wo
you
fairy
promised
and
early
the
next
morning
prudence
in
a
plain
gingham
house
dress
with
the
addition
of
a
red
sweater
jacket
and
cap
for
warmth
set
out
upon
her
secret
ride
it
was
a
magnificent
morning
and
prudence
sang
for
pure
delight
as
she
rode
swiftly
along
the
country
roads
the
country
was
simply
irresistible
it
was
almost
intoxicating
and
prudence
rode
farther
than
she
had
intended
east
and
west
north
and
south
she
went
apparently
guided
only
by
her
own
caprice
she
knew
it
was
growing
late
but
fairy
get
breakfast
she
thought
comfortably
finally
she
turned
in
a
leading
between
two
rich
hickory
groves
dismounting
at
the
top
of
a
long
hill
she
gazed
anxiously
around
her
no
one
was
in
sight
the
nearest
house
was
two
miles
behind
and
the
road
was
long
and
smooth
and
inviting
and
the
hill
was
steep
prudence
yearned
for
a
good
coast
with
her
feet
high
up
on
the
framework
of
the
wheel
and
the
pedals
flying
around
beneath
her
skirts
this
was
not
the
new
and
modern
model
of
bicycle
the
pedals
on
mattie
moore
wheel
revolved
whether
one
worked
them
or
not
it
seemed
safe
the
road
sloped
down
gradually
at
the
bottom
with
an
incline
on
the
other
side
what
more
could
one
desire
the
only
living
thing
in
sight
besides
birds
gossiping
in
the
leafy
branches
and
the
squirrel
scolding
to
himself
was
a
serious
mule
peacefully
grazing
near
the
bottom
of
the
hill
prudence
laughed
gleefully
like
a
child
she
never
laughed
again
in
exactly
that
way
this
was
the
last
appearance
of
the
old
irresponsible
prudence
the
curtain
was
just
ready
to
drop
here
goes
she
cried
and
leaping
nimbly
into
the
saddle
she
pedaled
swiftly
a
few
times
and
then
lifted
her
feet
to
the
coveted
position
the
pedals
flew
around
beneath
her
just
as
she
had
anticipated
and
the
wind
whistled
about
her
in
a
most
exhilarating
way
but
as
she
neared
the
bottom
a
disastrous
and
totally
unexpected
thing
happened
the
placid
mule
which
had
been
righteously
grazing
beside
the
fence
suddenly
stalked
into
the
middle
of
the
road
prudence
screamed
jerked
the
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
and
then
with
a
sickening
thud
she
landed
head
first
upon
some
part
of
the
anatomy
she
did
not
linger
there
however
she
bounced
on
down
to
the
ground
with
a
little
cry
of
pain
the
bicycle
crashed
beside
her
and
the
mule
slightly
startled
looked
around
at
her
with
ears
raised
in
silent
questioning
then
he
ambled
slowly
across
the
road
and
deliberately
continued
his
grazing
prudence
tried
to
raise
herself
but
she
felt
sharp
pain
she
heard
some
one
leaping
over
the
fence
near
her
and
wondered
without
moving
her
head
if
it
could
be
a
tramp
bent
on
highway
robbery
the
next
instant
a
man
was
leaning
over
her
it
not
a
tramp
she
thought
before
he
had
time
to
speak
are
you
hurt
he
cried
you
poor
child
prudence
smiled
pluckily
my
ankle
is
hurt
a
little
but
i
am
not
a
child
the
young
man
in
great
relief
laughed
aloud
and
prudence
joined
him
rather
faintly
i
afraid
i
can
not
walk
she
said
i
believe
i
broken
my
ankle
maybe
my
whole
leg
for
all
i
know
it
hurts
pretty
badly
lie
down
like
this
he
said
helping
her
to
a
more
comfortable
position
do
not
move
may
i
examine
your
foot
she
shook
her
head
but
he
removed
the
shoe
regardless
of
her
i
believe
it
is
sprained
i
am
sure
the
bone
is
not
broken
but
how
in
the
world
will
you
get
home
how
far
is
it
to
mount
mark
is
that
where
you
live
yes
considering
yes
i
live
there
and
it
must
be
four
miles
anyhow
what
shall
i
do
in
answer
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
arranged
it
carefully
by
the
side
of
the
road
on
the
grass
then
jerking
open
the
bag
he
had
carried
he
took
out
a
few
towels
and
three
soft
shirts
hastily
rolling
them
together
for
a
pillow
he
added
it
to
the
bed
pro
tem
then
he
turned
again
to
prudence
i
carry
you
over
here
and
fix
you
as
comfortably
as
i
can
then
i
go
to
the
nearest
house
and
get
a
wagon
to
take
you
home
prudence
was
not
shy
and
realizing
that
his
plan
was
the
wise
one
she
made
no
objections
when
he
came
to
help
her
across
the
road
i
think
i
can
walk
if
you
lift
me
up
but
the
first
movement
sent
such
a
twinge
of
pain
through
the
wounded
ankle
that
she
clutched
him
frantically
and
burst
into
tears
it
hurts
she
cried
do
touch
me
without
speaking
he
lifted
her
as
gently
as
he
could
and
carried
her
to
the
place
he
had
prepared
for
her
will
you
be
warm
enough
he
asked
after
he
had
stood
looking
awkwardly
down
upon
the
sobbing
girl
as
long
as
he
could
endure
it
yes
nodded
prudence
gulping
down
the
big
soft
rising
in
her
throat
i
run
do
you
know
which
way
is
nearest
to
a
house
it
been
a
long
time
since
i
passed
one
coming
this
way
the
way
i
came
is
the
nearest
but
it
two
miles
i
think
i
go
as
fast
as
i
can
and
you
will
be
all
right
this
confounded
is
so
out
of
the
way
that
no
one
will
pass
here
for
hours
i
suppose
now
lie
as
comfortably
as
you
can
and
do
not
worry
i
going
to
run
off
he
started
but
prudence
left
alone
was
suddenly
frightened
please
oh
please
she
called
after
him
and
when
he
came
back
she
buried
her
face
in
shame
deep
in
the
linen
towel
i
afraid
she
whispered
crying
again
i
do
not
wish
to
be
left
alone
here
a
snake
might
come
or
a
tramp
he
sat
down
beside
her
you
nervous
i
stay
with
you
until
you
feel
better
some
one
may
come
this
way
but
it
is
likely
a
man
i
passed
on
the
road
a
ways
back
told
me
to
cut
through
the
hickory
grove
and
i
would
save
a
mile
of
travel
that
how
i
happened
to
come
through
the
woods
and
find
you
he
smiled
a
little
and
prudence
remembering
the
nature
of
her
accident
flushed
then
being
prudence
she
laughed
it
was
my
own
fault
i
had
no
business
to
go
coasting
down
like
that
but
the
mule
was
so
stationary
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
contemplated
moving
for
the
next
century
at
least
he
was
a
bitter
disappointment
she
looked
down
the
roadside
where
the
mule
was
contentedly
grazing
with
never
so
much
as
a
sympathetic
glance
toward
his
victim
i
afraid
your
bicycle
is
rather
badly
done
up
oh
whatever
will
mattie
moore
say
to
me
it
borrowed
oh
i
see
now
that
it
was
just
foolish
pride
that
made
me
unwilling
to
ride
during
decent
hours
what
a
dunce
i
was
as
usual
he
looked
at
her
curiously
this
was
beyond
his
comprehension
the
bicycle
belongs
to
mattie
moore
she
lives
across
the
street
from
the
parsonage
and
i
wanted
to
ride
she
said
i
could
but
i
was
ashamed
to
ride
in
the
daytime
for
fear
some
of
the
members
would
think
it
improper
for
a
girl
of
the
parsonage
and
so
i
got
up
at
six
this
morning
to
do
it
on
the
sly
somehow
i
never
can
remember
that
it
is
just
as
bad
to
do
things
when
you
are
seen
as
when
you
are
it
does
seem
so
bad
does
it
but
of
course
it
is
but
i
never
think
of
that
when
i
need
to
be
thinking
of
it
maybe
i
remember
after
this
she
was
silent
a
while
fairy
have
to
get
breakfast
and
she
always
gets
father
eggs
too
hard
silence
again
maybe
papa
worry
but
then
they
know
by
this
time
that
something
always
does
happen
to
me
so
they
be
prepared
she
turned
gravely
to
the
young
man
beside
her
he
was
looking
down
at
her
too
and
as
their
eyes
met
and
clung
for
an
instant
a
slow
dark
color
rose
in
his
face
prudence
felt
a
curious
breathlessness
caused
by
her
hurting
ankle
undoubtedly
my
name
is
prudence
starr
i
am
the
methodist
minister
oldest
daughter
and
my
name
is
jerrold
harmer
he
was
looking
away
into
the
hickory
grove
now
my
home
is
in
des
moines
oh
des
moines
is
quite
a
city
is
it
i
heard
quite
a
lot
about
it
it
is
so
large
as
chicago
though
of
course
i
know
a
man
who
lives
in
chicago
we
used
to
be
great
chums
and
he
told
me
all
about
the
city
some
day
i
must
really
go
there
when
the
methodists
get
rich
enough
to
pay
their
ministers
just
a
little
more
salary
then
she
added
thoughtfully
still
i
could
go
even
if
i
had
the
money
because
i
could
leave
the
parsonage
so
it
just
as
well
about
the
money
after
all
but
chicago
must
be
very
nice
he
told
me
about
the
white
city
and
the
big
parks
and
the
elevated
railways
and
all
the
pretty
restaurants
and
hotels
i
love
pretty
places
to
eat
you
might
tell
me
about
des
moines
is
it
very
nice
are
there
lots
of
rich
people
there
of
course
i
do
not
really
care
any
more
about
the
rich
people
than
the
others
but
it
always
makes
a
city
seem
grand
to
have
a
lot
of
rich
citizens
i
think
do
you
so
he
told
her
about
des
moines
and
prudence
lay
with
her
eyes
listening
and
wondering
why
there
was
more
music
in
his
voice
than
in
most
voices
her
ankle
did
not
hurt
very
badly
she
did
not
mind
it
at
all
in
fact
she
never
gave
it
a
thought
from
beneath
her
lids
she
kept
her
eyes
fastened
on
jerrold
harmer
long
brown
hands
clasped
loosely
about
his
knees
and
whenever
she
could
she
looked
up
into
his
face
and
always
there
was
that
curious
catching
in
her
breath
and
she
looked
away
again
quickly
feeling
that
to
look
too
long
was
dangerous
i
have
talked
my
share
now
he
was
saying
tell
me
all
about
yourself
and
the
parsonage
and
your
family
and
who
is
fairy
and
do
you
attend
the
college
at
mount
mark
you
look
like
a
college
girl
oh
i
am
not
said
prudence
reluctant
to
make
the
admission
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
i
am
too
stupid
to
be
a
college
girl
our
mother
is
not
living
and
i
left
high
school
five
years
ago
and
have
been
keeping
house
for
my
father
and
sisters
since
then
i
am
twenty
years
old
how
old
are
you
i
am
and
he
smiled
jerrold
harmer
she
said
slowly
and
very
musically
it
is
such
a
nice
name
do
your
friends
call
you
jerry
the
boys
at
school
called
me
roldie
and
sometimes
hammie
but
my
mother
always
called
me
jerry
she
is
living
now
either
you
call
me
jerry
will
you
yes
i
will
but
it
wo
be
proper
but
that
never
makes
any
difference
to
me
except
when
it
might
shock
the
members
you
want
me
to
call
you
jerry
do
you
yes
i
do
and
when
we
are
better
acquainted
will
you
let
me
call
you
prudence
call
me
that
i
ca
be
too
particular
you
see
when
i
am
lying
on
your
coat
and
pillowed
with
your
belongings
you
might
get
cross
and
take
them
away
from
did
you
go
to
college
yes
to
harvard
but
i
was
not
much
of
a
student
then
i
knocked
around
a
while
looking
at
the
world
and
two
years
ago
i
went
home
to
des
moines
i
have
been
there
ever
since
except
for
little
runs
once
in
a
while
prudence
sighed
to
harvard
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
did
not
go
to
college
myself
why
there
does
seem
to
be
anything
lacking
about
you
what
do
you
care
about
college
well
you
went
to
college
she
answered
argumentatively
my
sister
fairy
is
going
now
she
very
clever
oh
very
you
like
her
i
am
sure
much
better
than
you
do
me
of
course
prudence
was
strangely
downcast
i
am
sure
i
wo
said
jerrold
harmer
with
unnecessary
vehemence
i
do
care
a
thing
for
college
girls
i
know
a
lot
of
them
and
aw
they
make
a
fellow
tired
i
like
home
girls
the
kind
that
stay
at
home
and
keep
house
and
are
sweet
and
comfortable
and
all
that
jerrold
flipped
over
abruptly
and
lay
on
the
grass
his
face
on
his
arms
turned
toward
her
face
they
were
quiet
for
a
while
but
their
glances
were
clinging
your
eyes
are
brown
are
they
prudence
smiled
as
though
she
had
made
a
pleasant
discovery
yes
yours
are
blue
i
noticed
that
first
thing
did
you
do
you
like
blue
eyes
they
are
as
well
as
strong
and
expressive
as
brown
eyes
fairy
are
brown
i
like
blue
eyes
best
they
are
so
much
brighter
and
deeper
you
see
clear
to
the
bottom
of
blue
eyes
you
have
to
keep
looking
and
he
did
keep
looking
did
you
play
football
at
college
you
are
so
tall
fairy
tall
too
fairy
very
i
tried
my
best
to
eat
lots
and
exercise
and
make
myself
bigger
but
i
am
a
fizzle
yes
i
played
but
girls
do
not
need
to
be
so
tall
as
men
do
you
remember
what
orlando
said
about
rosalind
as
tall
as
my
heart
i
imagine
you
come
about
to
my
shoulder
we
measure
as
soon
as
you
are
on
your
feet
again
are
you
going
to
live
in
mount
mark
now
are
you
coming
to
stay
prudence
was
almost
quivering
as
she
asked
this
it
was
of
vital
importance
no
i
will
only
be
there
a
few
days
but
i
shall
probably
be
back
every
week
or
so
is
your
father
very
strict
maybe
he
would
object
to
your
writing
to
me
oh
he
is
strict
at
all
and
he
will
be
glad
for
me
to
write
to
you
i
know
i
write
to
two
or
three
men
when
they
are
away
but
they
are
oh
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
i
do
not
really
like
to
write
to
them
i
believe
i
quit
it
such
a
bother
yes
it
is
that
so
i
think
i
would
quit
if
i
were
you
i
was
just
thinking
how
silly
it
is
for
me
to
keep
on
writing
to
some
girls
i
used
to
know
do
care
two
cents
about
i
going
to
cut
it
out
as
soon
as
i
get
home
but
you
will
write
to
me
wo
you
yes
of
course
prudence
laughed
shyly
it
seems
so
well
nice
to
think
of
getting
letters
from
you
i
bet
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
fellows
in
mount
mark
are
there
why
no
i
ca
think
of
any
real
nice
ones
oh
they
are
all
right
i
have
lots
of
friends
here
but
they
are
i
do
not
know
what
they
do
not
seem
very
nice
i
would
care
if
i
never
saw
them
again
but
they
are
good
to
me
yes
i
can
grasp
that
he
said
with
feeling
is
des
moines
just
full
of
beautiful
girls
i
should
say
not
i
never
saw
a
real
beautiful
girl
in
des
moines
in
my
life
or
any
place
else
for
that
matter
until
i
came
you
know
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
there
are
mighty
few
girls
that
look
just
the
way
you
want
them
to
look
prudence
nodded
that
the
way
with
men
too
of
all
the
men
i
have
seen
in
my
life
i
never
saw
one
before
that
looked
just
the
way
i
wanted
him
to
before
he
questioned
eagerly
yes
said
prudence
frankly
you
look
just
as
i
wish
you
to
and
in
the
meanwhile
at
the
parsonage
fairy
was
patiently
getting
breakfast
prudence
went
out
for
an
early
bicycle
ride
so
the
members
would
catch
her
she
explained
to
the
family
and
she
is
back
yet
she
probably
stay
out
until
afternoon
and
then
ride
right
by
the
grocery
store
where
the
ladies
have
their
saturday
sale
prudence
all
over
oh
father
i
did
forget
your
eggs
again
i
am
afraid
they
are
too
hard
here
twins
you
carry
in
the
oatmeal
and
we
will
eat
no
use
to
wait
for
prudence
it
would
be
like
waiting
for
the
next
comet
indeed
it
was
nearly
noon
when
a
small
spring
wagon
drove
into
the
parsonage
yard
starr
was
in
his
study
with
a
book
but
he
heard
a
piercing
shriek
from
connie
and
a
shrill
prudence
from
one
of
the
twins
he
was
downstairs
in
three
leaps
and
rushing
wildly
out
to
the
little
rickety
wagon
and
there
was
prudence
do
be
frightened
father
i
just
sprained
my
ankle
and
it
does
hurt
hardly
any
but
the
bicycle
is
broken
we
have
to
pay
for
it
you
can
use
my
own
money
in
the
bank
poor
davis
had
to
walk
all
the
way
to
town
because
there
was
any
room
for
him
in
the
wagon
with
me
lying
down
like
this
will
you
carry
me
in
connie
single
bed
was
hastily
brought
downstairs
and
prudence
deposited
upon
it
there
no
use
to
put
me
she
assured
them
i
wo
stay
there
i
want
to
be
down
here
where
i
can
boss
the
girls
the
doctor
came
in
and
bandaged
the
swollen
purple
ankle
then
they
had
dinner
they
tried
to
remember
to
call
it
luncheon
but
never
succeeded
after
that
the
whole
parsonage
family
grouped
about
the
little
single
bed
in
the
cheery
whose
coat
is
this
prudence
asked
connie
and
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
these
towels
and
silk
shirts
added
fairy
prudence
blushed
most
exquisitely
they
are
harmer
she
said
and
glanced
nervously
at
her
father
whose
chorused
the
family
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
lark
was
ready
to
take
mental
notes
with
an
eye
to
future
stories
if
you
will
sit
down
and
keep
still
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
but
you
must
not
interrupt
me
what
time
is
it
fairy
two
oh
two
then
i
have
plenty
of
time
well
when
i
got
to
that
little
through
the
hickory
grove
about
four
miles
out
from
town
i
thought
i
would
coast
down
the
long
hill
do
you
remember
that
hill
father
there
was
no
one
in
sight
and
no
animals
except
one
hoary
old
mule
grazing
at
the
bottom
it
was
irresistible
absolutely
irresistible
so
i
coasted
but
you
know
yourself
father
there
is
no
trusting
a
mule
they
are
the
most
undependable
animals
prudence
looked
thoughtfully
down
at
the
bed
for
a
moment
and
added
slowly
still
i
have
no
hard
feelings
against
the
mule
in
fact
i
kind
of
like
well
anyway
just
as
i
got
to
the
critical
place
in
the
hill
that
mule
skipped
right
out
in
front
of
me
it
looked
as
though
he
did
it
on
purpose
i
did
not
have
time
to
get
out
of
his
way
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
get
out
of
mine
and
so
i
went
bang
right
into
him
and
it
broke
mattie
moore
wheel
and
upset
me
quite
a
little
but
that
mule
never
budged
jerry
er
harmer
harmer
you
know
said
he
believed
an
earthquake
could
coast
downhill
on
to
that
mule
without
seriously
inconveniencing
him
i
was
hurt
a
little
and
could
get
up
and
so
he
jumped
over
the
fence
no
connie
not
the
mule
of
course
harmer
he
jumped
over
the
fence
and
put
his
coat
on
the
ground
and
made
a
pillow
for
me
with
the
shirts
and
towels
in
his
bag
and
carried
me
over
then
he
wanted
to
go
for
a
wagon
to
bring
me
home
but
i
was
too
nervous
and
scared
so
he
stayed
with
me
then
davis
came
along
with
his
cart
and
jerry
er
harmer
you
know
helped
put
me
in
and
the
cart
was
so
small
they
both
had
to
walk
where
is
he
now
is
he
young
is
he
handsome
did
he
look
rich
do
be
silly
girls
he
went
to
the
hotel
i
suppose
anyhow
he
left
us
as
soon
as
we
reached
town
he
said
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
had
something
to
look
after
his
coat
was
underneath
me
in
the
wagon
and
he
would
take
it
out
for
fear
of
hurting
my
ankle
so
the
poor
soul
is
probably
wandering
around
this
town
in
his
already
in
the
eyes
of
the
girls
this
jerry
er
harmer
had
taken
unto
himself
all
the
interest
of
the
affair
he
have
to
come
for
his
coat
said
lark
we
bound
to
see
him
where
does
he
live
what
was
he
doing
in
the
hickory
grove
inquired
starr
with
a
strangely
sinking
heart
for
her
eyes
were
alight
with
new
and
wonderful
radiance
he
lives
in
des
moines
he
was
just
walking
into
town
and
took
a
short
cut
through
the
grove
walking
from
des
moines
prudence
flushed
uncomfortably
i
did
think
of
that
she
said
but
i
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
walk
if
he
likes
he
strong
and
athletic
and
fond
of
exercise
i
guess
he
plenty
able
to
walk
if
he
wants
to
i
sure
he
no
tramp
father
if
that
is
what
you
are
thinking
i
am
not
thinking
anything
of
the
kind
prudence
he
said
with
dignity
but
i
do
think
it
rather
strange
that
a
young
man
should
set
out
to
walk
from
des
moines
to
mount
mark
and
why
should
he
be
at
it
so
early
in
the
morning
does
he
require
sleep
as
the
rest
of
us
do
how
should
i
know
i
guess
if
he
likes
to
be
but
in
the
morning
when
it
is
fresh
and
sweet
it
is
all
right
i
like
the
morning
myself
he
had
as
much
right
out
early
as
i
had
his
clothes
were
nice
and
he
is
a
harvard
graduate
and
his
shoes
were
dusty
but
not
soiled
or
worn
anyhow
he
is
coming
at
four
if
you
want
to
ask
if
he
is
a
tramp
you
can
do
it
and
prudence
burst
into
tears
dramatic
silence
in
the
cheerful
then
fairy
began
bustling
about
to
bathe
the
face
and
throat
of
poor
little
prudence
and
her
father
said
sympathetically
you
all
nervous
and
wrought
up
with
the
pain
and
excitement
prudence
i
glad
he
is
coming
so
we
can
thank
him
for
his
kindness
it
was
mighty
lucky
he
happened
along
was
it
a
harvard
graduate
yes
they
are
pretty
strong
on
athletics
at
harvard
you
better
straighten
this
room
a
little
and
have
things
looking
nice
when
he
gets
here
said
father
starr
with
great
diplomacy
and
he
was
rewarded
and
startled
by
observing
that
prudence
brightened
wonderfully
at
his
words
yes
do
she
urged
eagerly
get
some
of
the
roses
from
the
corner
bush
and
put
them
on
the
table
there
and
when
you
go
fairy
you
better
bring
down
that
little
lace
spread
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
our
dresser
it
look
very
nice
on
this
work
hard
girls
and
get
everything
looking
fine
he
be
here
at
four
he
said
you
twins
may
wear
your
white
dresses
and
connie
must
put
on
her
blue
and
wear
her
blue
fairy
do
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
for
you
to
wear
your
silk
dress
of
course
the
silk
is
rather
grand
for
home
but
you
do
look
so
beautiful
in
it
father
will
you
put
on
your
black
suit
or
are
you
too
busy
and
do
forget
to
wear
the
pearl
cuff
buttons
aunt
grace
sent
you
he
went
to
obey
with
despair
in
his
heart
but
to
the
girls
there
was
nothing
strange
in
this
exactness
on
the
part
of
prudence
jerrold
harmer
was
the
hero
of
the
romance
and
they
must
unite
to
do
him
honor
he
was
probably
a
prince
in
disguise
jerrold
harmer
was
a
perfectly
thrilling
name
it
was
really
a
shame
that
america
allows
no
titles
lord
jerrold
did
sound
so
noble
and
lady
prudence
was
very
effective
too
he
and
prudence
were
married
and
had
a
family
of
four
children
named
for
the
various
starrs
before
one
hour
had
passed
i
begin
my
book
right
away
lark
was
saying
she
and
carol
were
in
the
madly
polishing
their
sunday
shoes
what
time
they
were
not
performing
the
marriage
ceremony
of
their
sister
and
the
hero
yes
do
but
for
goodness
sake
do
run
her
into
a
mule
seems
to
me
even
prudence
could
have
done
better
than
that
i
have
his
automobile
break
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
prudence
can
run
into
it
the
carbureter
came
off
and
of
course
the
car
would
run
an
inch
without
it
yes
that
good
said
carol
approvingly
it
must
be
a
sixty
cylinder
eight
horsepower
er
ford
or
something
real
big
and
costly
twins
you
wo
be
ready
warned
prudence
and
this
dire
possibility
sent
them
flying
upstairs
in
a
panic
while
the
girls
bubbling
over
with
excitement
were
dressing
for
the
great
event
starr
went
to
sit
with
prudence
carol
called
to
him
on
his
way
down
and
he
paused
on
the
staircase
looking
up
at
her
lark
and
i
are
going
to
use
some
of
fairy
powder
father
she
said
we
feel
that
we
simply
must
on
an
occasion
like
this
and
for
sake
do
mention
it
before
him
it
does
happen
very
often
you
know
but
we
simply
must
now
do
you
say
anything
about
falling
in
the
flour
barrel
or
turning
pale
all
of
a
sudden
whatever
else
you
do
we
be
so
mortified
father
starr
was
concerned
with
weightier
matters
and
went
on
down
to
prudence
with
never
so
much
as
a
reproving
shake
of
the
head
for
the
young
twins
father
began
prudence
her
eyes
on
the
lace
coverlet
do
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
for
me
to
wear
that
silk
of
mother
i
need
something
over
my
nightgown
and
my
old
flannel
kimono
is
so
ugly
you
know
mother
said
i
was
to
have
it
and
i
twenty
now
do
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
but
if
you
do
not
want
me
to
wear
it
i
do
want
you
to
was
the
prompt
reply
yes
it
is
quite
time
you
were
wearing
it
i
get
it
out
of
the
trunk
myself
and
send
fairy
down
to
help
you
then
as
he
turned
toward
the
door
he
asked
carelessly
is
he
very
prudence
and
prudence
with
a
crimson
face
answered
quickly
oh
i
really
notice
father
he
went
on
then
and
presently
fairy
came
down
with
the
dainty
silk
gown
trimmed
with
fine
soft
lace
i
brought
my
lavender
ribbon
for
your
hair
prudence
it
will
match
the
gown
so
nicely
oh
you
do
look
sweet
dearest
i
pity
jerrold
harmer
i
can
tell
you
that
now
i
must
hurry
and
finish
my
own
dressing
but
with
her
foot
on
the
bottom
stair
she
paused
her
sister
was
calling
after
her
send
father
down
here
quick
fairy
father
ran
down
quickly
and
prudence
catching
hold
of
his
hands
whispered
wretchedly
oh
father
he
he
is
i
i
did
notice
it
i
did
really
mean
to
lie
to
you
there
now
prudence
he
said
kissing
her
tenderly
you
must
get
excited
again
i
afraid
you
are
too
nervous
to
have
callers
you
must
lie
very
quietly
until
he
comes
that
was
no
lie
child
you
are
so
upset
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
be
quiet
now
prudence
it
nearly
time
for
him
to
come
you
are
a
dear
good
father
she
cried
kissing
his
hands
passionately
but
it
was
a
lie
i
did
know
what
i
was
saying
i
did
it
on
purpose
and
starr
heart
was
heavy
for
he
knew
that
his
fears
were
realized
chapter
xii
roused
from
her
slumber
at
twenty
minutes
to
four
the
parsonage
family
clustered
excitedly
in
the
which
the
sunshine
flooded
cheerily
they
were
waiting
for
the
hero
of
prudence
romance
oh
larkie
will
you
run
and
bring
my
lace
handkerchief
on
our
dresser
in
the
box
and
after
lark
had
departed
she
went
on
the
flowers
are
not
quite
in
the
center
of
the
table
fairy
a
little
to
the
if
you
would
move
the
curtains
the
least
little
bit
those
torn
places
would
not
show
then
she
sighed
how
nice
you
all
look
oh
connie
wo
you
turn
the
clock
a
little
this
way
so
i
can
see
it
that
better
thank
you
precious
thank
you
lark
it
a
pretty
handkerchief
i
only
carried
it
three
times
and
i
have
never
really
used
it
would
you
keep
these
pearls
on
fairy
or
would
you
take
them
off
i
would
keep
them
on
prue
they
catch
the
color
of
the
gown
a
little
and
are
just
beautiful
you
do
look
so
sweet
but
your
face
is
very
flushed
i
am
afraid
you
are
feverish
maybe
we
had
better
not
let
him
see
prue
father
perhaps
he
can
come
back
fairy
exclaimed
prudence
besides
he
must
come
in
to
get
his
coat
we
ca
expect
him
to
go
coatless
over
sunday
listen
listen
girls
look
fairy
and
see
if
that
is
he
yes
it
is
i
know
i
can
tell
by
his
walk
warm
rich
color
dyed
her
face
and
throat
and
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
heart
wondering
if
connie
beside
her
could
hear
its
tumult
i
go
to
the
door
said
father
starr
and
prudence
looked
at
him
beseechingly
i
i
am
sure
he
is
all
right
father
i
you
will
be
nice
to
him
you
without
answering
starr
left
the
room
he
could
not
trust
his
voice
listen
girls
i
want
to
hear
whispered
prudence
and
she
smiled
as
she
heard
her
father
cordial
voice
you
are
harmer
are
you
i
am
prudence
father
come
right
in
the
whole
family
is
assembled
to
do
you
honor
the
girls
have
already
made
you
a
prince
in
disguise
come
back
this
way
prudence
is
resting
very
nicely
when
the
two
men
stepped
into
the
prudence
for
once
quite
overlooked
her
father
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
jerrold
harmer
face
and
waited
breathless
nor
was
he
long
in
finding
her
among
the
bevy
of
girls
he
walked
at
once
to
the
bed
and
took
her
hand
my
little
comrade
of
the
road
he
said
gaily
but
with
tenderness
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
feeling
well
enough
for
callers
oh
yes
i
am
protested
prudence
with
strange
shyness
he
turned
to
the
other
girls
and
greeted
them
easily
he
was
entirely
miss
starr
told
me
so
much
about
you
that
i
know
you
all
to
begin
with
he
smiled
at
fairy
as
he
added
in
fact
she
predicted
that
i
am
to
fall
in
love
with
you
and
so
very
likely
i
should
if
i
had
met
your
sister
first
they
all
laughed
at
that
and
then
he
walked
back
and
stood
by
prudence
once
more
was
it
a
bad
sprain
does
it
pain
you
very
badly
you
look
tired
i
am
afraid
it
was
an
imposition
for
me
to
come
this
afternoon
illustration
she
predicted
i
to
fall
in
love
with
you
oh
do
worry
about
that
put
in
connie
anxiously
she
wanted
you
to
come
she
been
getting
us
ready
for
you
ever
since
the
doctor
left
i
think
it
was
kind
of
silly
for
me
to
wear
my
blue
just
for
one
caller
the
twins
glared
at
her
realizing
that
she
was
discrediting
the
parsonage
but
jerrold
harmer
laughed
and
prudence
joined
him
it
is
quite
true
she
admitted
frankly
the
mule
and
i
disgraced
the
parsonage
this
morning
and
i
wanted
the
rest
of
you
to
redeem
it
this
afternoon
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
then
you
had
another
coat
no
i
did
i
saw
this
one
in
a
window
this
morning
and
resist
it
was
the
ride
very
hard
on
your
ankle
starr
was
puzzled
evidently
it
was
not
lack
of
funds
which
brought
this
man
on
foot
from
des
moines
to
mount
mark
across
the
state
he
did
not
look
like
a
man
fleeing
from
justice
what
then
was
the
explanation
you
must
have
found
it
rather
a
long
walk
he
began
tentatively
his
eyes
on
the
young
man
face
yes
i
think
my
feet
are
a
little
blistered
i
have
walked
farther
than
that
many
times
but
i
am
out
of
practise
now
sometimes
however
walking
is
a
painful
necessity
how
long
did
it
take
you
coming
from
des
moines
to
mount
mark
inquired
carol
in
a
subdued
and
respectful
voice
and
curious
withal
i
did
not
come
directly
to
mount
mark
i
stopped
several
places
on
business
i
hardly
know
how
long
it
would
take
coming
straight
through
it
would
depend
on
one
luck
i
suppose
well
said
lark
taking
it
a
little
at
a
time
it
might
be
done
but
for
myself
i
should
never
dream
of
undertaking
so
much
exercise
could
you
walk
from
here
to
burlington
at
one
stretch
asked
connie
he
looked
rather
surprised
why
perhaps
i
could
if
i
was
in
shape
but
seven
miles
was
all
i
cared
about
this
morning
well
i
think
it
was
mighty
brave
of
you
to
walk
that
far
i
do
care
why
you
did
it
announced
connie
with
emphasis
brave
he
repeated
i
have
walked
three
times
seven
miles
often
when
i
was
in
school
oh
i
mean
the
whole
thing
clear
from
des
moines
explained
connie
from
des
moines
he
gasped
good
heavens
i
did
not
walk
from
des
moines
did
you
he
turned
to
prudence
questioningly
did
you
think
i
walked
clear
from
des
moines
yes
and
added
hastily
but
i
did
not
care
if
you
did
it
did
not
make
any
difference
how
you
came
for
a
moment
he
was
puzzled
then
he
burst
out
laughing
i
am
afraid
we
had
too
much
to
talk
about
this
morning
i
thought
i
had
explained
my
situation
but
evidently
i
did
not
i
drove
from
des
moines
in
the
car
and
the
automobile
gasped
carol
with
a
triumphant
look
at
lark
yes
just
so
i
stopped
several
places
on
business
as
i
came
through
i
drove
from
burlington
this
morning
but
i
got
off
the
road
the
car
broke
down
on
me
and
i
could
fix
it
broke
an
axle
so
i
had
to
walk
in
that
is
what
i
was
seeing
about
sending
a
man
out
for
the
car
and
arranging
about
the
repairs
he
smiled
again
what
in
the
world
did
you
think
i
would
walk
from
des
moines
for
he
asked
prudence
more
inquisitive
than
grammatical
i
did
not
think
anything
about
it
until
they
asked
and
i
did
not
know
about
the
car
you
did
not
mention
it
no
i
remember
now
we
were
talking
of
other
things
all
the
time
he
turned
frankly
to
starr
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
harmer
automobile
company
of
des
moines
my
father
was
harvey
harmer
two
years
ago
when
i
was
running
around
in
europe
he
died
it
was
his
desire
that
i
should
personally
take
charge
of
the
business
so
i
hurried
home
and
have
had
charge
of
the
company
since
then
we
are
establishing
sales
agencies
here
and
in
burlington
and
several
other
towns
i
came
out
for
a
little
trip
and
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
business
with
our
new
men
that
what
brought
me
to
mount
mark
to
connie
he
added
laughingly
so
i
must
sacrifice
myself
and
do
without
your
praise
i
did
not
walk
until
the
car
broke
down
and
compelled
me
to
do
so
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
prudence
distinctly
triumphed
over
her
father
she
flashed
him
the
glance
of
a
conqueror
and
he
nodded
understandingly
he
liked
jerrold
harmer
as
much
as
he
could
like
any
man
who
stepped
seriously
into
the
life
of
prudence
he
was
glad
that
things
were
well
but
they
would
excuse
him
he
must
look
after
his
sunday
sermons
a
little
later
the
twins
and
connie
grew
restless
and
finally
connie
blurted
out
say
prue
do
you
think
we
upheld
the
parsonage
long
enough
i
want
to
get
some
fresh
air
the
twins
would
never
have
been
guilty
of
such
social
indiscretion
as
this
but
they
gladly
availed
themselves
of
connie
break
and
followed
her
then
fairy
got
up
laughing
i
have
done
my
share
too
i
think
we
leave
the
parsonage
in
your
hands
now
prue
i
want
to
write
to
aunt
grace
i
be
just
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
if
prudence
wants
me
you
will
call
wo
you
harmer
and
wo
you
stay
for
dinner
with
us
i
sure
to
disgrace
the
parsonage
again
for
i
am
no
cook
but
you
can
get
along
for
once
surely
we
spend
more
time
laughing
when
the
food
is
bad
and
laughter
is
very
healthful
you
will
stay
wo
you
jerrold
harmer
looked
very
eager
and
yet
he
looked
somewhat
doubtfully
at
prudence
her
eyes
were
eloquent
with
entreaties
finally
he
laughed
and
said
i
should
certainly
like
to
stay
but
you
see
i
want
to
come
back
now
will
i
dare
to
come
back
if
i
stay
for
dinner
would
connie
say
that
was
disgracing
the
parsonage
fairy
laughed
delightedly
that
is
very
good
she
said
then
you
will
stay
i
try
to
fix
it
up
with
connie
to
save
the
reputation
of
the
house
now
do
not
talk
too
much
prue
and
what
shall
we
have
for
dinner
we
only
say
dinner
when
we
have
company
harmer
what
we
have
is
supper
prudence
contracted
her
brows
in
the
earnest
endeavor
to
compose
a
menu
suitable
for
this
occasion
mashed
potatoes
and
use
cream
fairy
you
better
let
lark
do
the
mashing
for
you
always
leave
lumps
and
breaded
veal
cutlet
with
a
significant
glance
and
creamed
peas
and
radishes
and
fruit
will
that
be
enough
for
you
mr
harmer
oceans
he
said
contentedly
well
i
collect
the
twins
and
connie
and
we
will
try
to
think
up
a
few
additions
where
the
money
in
the
dungeon
and
the
key
is
on
the
nail
above
the
door
and
the
silverware
is
there
too
with
another
significant
glance
after
that
prudence
lay
back
happily
on
the
pillows
and
smoothed
the
lace
on
her
mother
silk
dressing
gown
talk
to
me
she
said
tell
me
about
where
you
live
and
what
you
do
your
work
you
know
and
how
you
amuse
yourself
i
want
you
to
amuse
me
now
mr
harmer
you
called
me
jerry
this
morning
yes
i
know
do
you
want
me
to
call
you
jerry
still
yes
prudence
i
do
do
you
mind
if
i
move
my
chair
a
little
closer
no
put
it
right
here
now
i
am
ready
but
there
nothing
interesting
about
me
let
talk
of
it
interesting
to
me
tell
me
about
your
business
you
do
care
anything
about
business
i
am
sure
i
care
about
your
business
do
you
prudence
you
look
so
sweet
this
afternoon
i
nearly
blurted
it
out
before
the
whole
family
would
the
twins
have
laughed
it
would
have
disgraced
the
parsonage
i
think
starr
is
awfully
lucky
to
have
five
girls
and
all
of
them
pretty
but
is
it
strange
that
the
prettiest
and
dearest
one
of
them
all
should
be
the
oldest
daughter
oh
but
i
not
really
prudence
began
earnestly
then
she
stopped
and
added
honestly
but
i
am
glad
you
think
so
no
they
did
not
quote
poetry
they
did
not
discuss
the
psychological
intricacies
of
spontaneous
attraction
they
did
not
say
anything
deep
or
wise
or
learned
but
they
smiled
at
each
other
with
pleased
investigating
eyes
he
put
his
hand
on
the
coverlet
just
near
enough
to
touch
the
lace
on
the
sleeve
of
her
silk
dressing
gown
and
together
they
found
paradise
in
the
shabby
of
the
old
methodist
parsonage
that
afternoon
must
you
prepare
meat
for
breading
half
an
hour
before
cooking
or
when
demanded
fairy
from
the
door
what
oh
fifteen
minutes
before
do
forget
to
salt
and
pepper
the
crumbs
fairy
perhaps
some
time
your
father
will
let
you
and
a
couple
of
the
others
come
to
des
moines
with
me
in
the
car
you
would
enjoy
a
few
days
there
i
know
i
live
with
my
aunt
a
dear
motherly
little
old
soul
she
will
adore
you
prudence
and
you
will
like
her
too
would
your
father
let
you
spend
a
week
we
can
easily
drive
back
and
forth
in
the
car
maybe
he
will
but
who
will
keep
the
parsonage
while
i
am
away
fairy
to
be
sure
she
must
be
a
good
fairy
once
in
a
while
we
can
take
the
twins
with
us
connie
too
if
you
like
and
then
fairy
will
only
have
to
mother
your
father
do
you
like
riding
in
a
car
oh
i
love
it
but
i
have
not
ridden
very
much
willard
morley
took
me
quite
often
when
he
was
here
but
he
is
in
chicago
now
when
he
coming
back
suspiciously
prudence
shall
we
have
tea
or
coffee
this
was
lark
from
the
doorway
fairy
wants
to
know
what
oh
which
do
you
want
jerry
which
does
your
father
prefer
he
does
drink
either
except
for
breakfast
i
generally
drink
coffee
but
i
do
not
care
much
for
it
so
do
not
bother
coffee
lark
when
that
morley
chap
coming
back
i
do
not
know
and
then
he
is
never
coming
back
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
jerrold
relented
promptly
you
are
why
he
went
away
i
suppose
at
any
rate
he
is
gone
did
you
ever
have
a
lover
prudence
a
real
lover
i
mean
no
i
never
did
i
awfully
glad
of
that
i
prudence
do
you
use
half
milk
and
half
water
for
creamed
tomato
soup
or
all
milk
what
oh
all
milk
connie
and
tell
fairy
not
to
salt
it
until
it
is
entirely
done
or
it
may
curdle
what
in
the
world
would
they
ever
do
without
you
prudence
you
are
the
soul
of
the
parsonage
are
you
no
i
am
just
the
cook
and
the
chambermaid
she
answered
laughing
but
do
you
see
how
hard
it
will
be
for
me
to
go
away
but
it
is
fair
vacation
is
coming
now
and
fairy
ought
to
take
a
turn
what
will
they
do
when
you
get
married
i
have
always
said
i
would
not
get
married
but
do
you
want
to
get
married
some
time
oh
that
is
it
i
just
ca
because
i
must
take
care
of
the
parsonage
and
raise
the
girls
i
ca
but
you
will
he
whispered
and
his
hand
touched
hers
for
just
a
second
prudence
did
not
answer
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
and
caught
in
her
breath
once
more
a
little
later
he
said
do
you
mind
if
i
go
upstairs
and
talk
to
your
father
a
few
minutes
maybe
i
better
but
do
not
stay
very
long
she
urged
and
she
wondered
why
the
brightness
and
sunshine
vanished
from
the
room
when
he
went
out
first
door
to
the
right
she
called
after
him
starr
arose
to
greet
him
and
welcomed
him
to
his
combination
study
and
bedroom
with
great
friendliness
but
jerrold
went
straight
to
the
point
starr
it
very
kind
of
you
to
receive
a
perfect
stranger
as
you
have
me
but
i
understand
that
with
a
girl
like
prudence
you
will
want
to
be
careful
i
can
give
you
the
names
of
several
prominent
men
in
des
moines
christians
who
know
me
well
and
can
tell
you
all
about
me
it
is
necessary
we
are
parsonage
people
and
we
are
accustomed
to
receiving
men
and
women
as
worthy
of
our
trust
until
we
find
them
different
we
are
glad
to
count
you
among
our
friends
thank
you
but
you
see
starr
this
is
a
little
different
some
day
prudence
and
i
will
want
to
be
married
and
you
will
wish
to
be
sure
about
me
does
prudence
know
about
that
no
with
a
smile
we
have
got
that
far
yet
but
i
am
sure
she
feels
it
she
has
well
you
know
what
i
mean
she
has
been
asleep
but
i
believe
she
is
waking
up
now
yes
i
think
so
do
you
mind
if
i
ask
you
a
few
questions
no
indeed
anything
you
like
well
first
are
you
a
christian
not
the
kind
you
are
starr
my
parents
were
christians
but
never
thought
much
about
it
myself
because
i
was
young
and
full
of
fun
i
have
never
been
especially
directed
to
religion
i
go
to
church
and
i
believe
the
bible
though
i
do
know
much
about
it
i
seldom
read
it
but
i
get
busy
now
if
you
like
and
really
study
it
and
try
to
come
around
your
way
i
know
prudence
would
make
me
do
that
and
he
smiled
again
do
you
drink
i
did
a
little
but
i
promised
prudence
this
morning
i
would
quit
it
i
never
got
drunk
and
i
have
not
formed
the
habit
but
sometimes
with
the
boys
i
drink
a
little
but
i
do
not
care
for
it
and
i
swore
off
this
i
smoke
too
not
cigarettes
of
course
prudence
knows
it
but
she
did
not
make
me
promise
to
quit
that
his
voice
was
raised
inquiringly
would
you
have
promised
if
she
had
asked
it
this
was
sheer
curiosity
i
suppose
i
would
he
flushed
a
little
i
know
i
was
pretty
hard
hit
and
it
was
such
a
new
experience
that
i
would
have
promised
anything
she
asked
but
i
like
smoking
and
i
do
think
it
is
wicked
never
mind
the
smoking
i
only
asked
that
question
out
of
curiosity
we
not
as
as
we
might
be
perhaps
the
only
things
i
would
really
object
to
are
those
things
that
might
seriously
menace
your
happiness
yours
and
hers
if
the
time
does
come
but
the
next
question
can
you
pass
a
strict
physical
examination
yes
i
can
i
go
with
you
to
your
physician
if
you
like
i
all
right
physically
i
know
tell
me
about
your
relations
with
your
mother
when
she
was
living
she
has
been
dead
four
years
jerrold
spoke
with
some
emotion
we
were
great
chums
though
her
health
was
always
poor
i
wrote
her
three
times
a
week
when
i
was
away
from
home
and
she
wrote
me
a
note
every
day
when
i
was
in
school
i
spent
all
my
vacations
at
home
to
be
with
her
and
i
never
went
abroad
until
after
her
death
because
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
my
going
so
far
from
her
jerrold
my
boy
i
do
not
want
to
seem
too
severe
but
tell
me
has
there
been
anything
in
your
life
about
women
that
could
come
out
and
hurt
prudence
later
on
jerrold
hesitated
starr
i
have
been
young
and
headstrong
and
impulsive
i
have
done
some
things
i
wish
now
i
had
but
i
believe
there
is
nothing
that
i
could
not
explain
to
prudence
so
she
would
understand
if
i
had
thought
beforehand
of
a
girl
like
her
there
are
things
i
would
not
have
done
but
there
is
nothing
i
think
that
would
really
hurt
after
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
it
over
with
her
all
right
if
you
are
the
man
god
bless
you
i
do
suppose
you
are
worthy
of
prudence
for
she
is
a
good
unselfish
girl
there
could
be
none
better
but
the
real
point
is
just
whether
you
will
love
each
other
enough
i
like
your
coming
up
here
like
this
i
think
that
was
very
decent
and
manly
of
you
and
do
you
mind
if
i
just
suggest
that
you
go
a
little
slow
with
prudence
remember
that
she
has
been
sound
asleep
until
this
morning
i
do
not
want
her
awakened
too
rudely
neither
do
i
said
jerrold
quickly
shall
i
go
down
now
the
girls
have
invited
me
to
stay
for
supper
and
prudence
says
i
am
to
come
back
too
is
that
all
right
remember
i
be
going
home
on
monday
it
is
all
right
certainly
spend
as
much
time
here
as
you
like
you
will
either
get
worse
or
get
cured
and
whichever
it
is
you
got
to
have
a
chance
i
like
you
jerrold
prudence
judges
by
instinct
but
it
does
not
often
fail
her
prudence
heard
him
running
down
the
stairs
boyishly
and
when
he
came
in
before
she
could
speak
he
whispered
shut
your
eyes
tight
prudence
and
do
not
scold
me
for
i
ca
help
it
then
he
put
his
hands
over
hers
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
they
were
both
breathless
after
that
prudence
lifted
her
lashes
slowly
and
gazed
at
him
seriously
it
was
she
who
spoke
first
i
was
never
really
kissed
before
she
whispered
not
really
then
they
sat
in
silence
until
fairy
announced
that
supper
was
ready
but
i
wo
promise
it
is
eatable
she
assured
them
laughing
i
wish
i
could
go
to
the
table
too
said
prudence
looking
at
her
father
wistfully
i
could
lie
on
the
old
lounge
out
there
and
have
your
supper
on
a
tray
of
course
can
you
carry
her
father
i
can
volunteered
jerrold
promptly
i
have
done
it
i
think
between
us
we
can
manage
we
try
it
and
prudence
heroically
endured
the
pain
of
being
moved
for
the
sake
of
seeing
jerrold
at
the
table
with
her
parsonage
family
for
to
her
surprise
she
realized
that
she
could
not
bear
that
even
a
few
minutes
should
pass
when
she
could
not
see
the
manly
young
face
with
the
boyish
mouth
and
the
tender
eyes
prudence
at
last
was
aroused
from
her
slumber
chapter
xiii
she
orders
her
life
prudence
are
you
going
to
aunt
grace
early
in
the
summer
or
late
demanded
fairy
oh
let
not
talk
of
that
now
there
plenty
of
time
no
there
is
school
will
be
out
in
a
week
and
babbie
wants
to
give
a
house
party
and
have
our
little
bunch
at
his
home
for
a
few
days
this
summer
he
wants
to
set
the
date
and
i
ca
tell
him
when
because
i
do
not
know
when
you
are
going
to
auntie
they
sat
around
the
breakfast
table
prudence
and
fairy
and
their
father
talking
of
the
summer
the
twins
and
connie
had
long
since
excused
themselves
and
even
now
could
be
heard
shouting
gaily
in
the
field
beyond
the
old
red
barn
prudence
looked
restlessly
from
one
to
the
other
when
her
sister
insisted
upon
an
answer
why
she
began
i
about
decided
not
to
go
to
aunt
grace
this
summer
fairy
rapped
on
the
table
with
the
spoon
she
held
in
her
hand
be
silly
you
have
to
go
you
never
had
a
vacation
in
your
life
and
father
promised
aunt
grace
on
his
reputation
as
a
minister
you
papa
yes
i
promised
all
right
but
papa
i
do
not
have
to
go
do
i
a
whole
month
oh
honestly
i
do
not
want
to
why
do
you
last
fall
you
were
wild
about
it
do
you
remember
dreaming
oh
but
that
was
last
fall
said
prudence
smiling
softly
and
unconsciously
she
lifted
one
hand
to
where
a
bulky
letter
nestled
inside
her
dress
i
did
know
i
was
going
to
sprain
my
ankle
and
be
so
useless
it
may
be
two
weeks
yet
before
i
can
walk
on
it
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
do
you
really
prefer
to
stay
at
home
prudence
queried
her
father
the
whole
summer
prudence
blushed
most
gloriously
oh
well
she
began
slowly
then
she
took
the
plunge
recklessly
why
you
see
father
jerry
lives
with
his
aunt
in
des
moines
he
told
you
that
did
he
and
they
have
quite
a
big
house
and
he
wants
to
take
me
and
the
twinnies
to
des
moines
in
the
car
for
a
week
or
ten
days
and
fairy
will
take
care
of
you
and
connie
and
if
i
can
do
that
i
do
not
want
any
more
vacation
i
could
bear
to
stay
at
auntie
a
whole
month
away
from
you
and
the
parsonage
she
felt
very
guilty
for
she
did
not
add
as
she
was
thinking
besides
jerry
is
coming
every
two
weeks
and
if
i
were
away
we
would
miss
a
visit
fairy
laughed
in
an
irritating
suggestive
way
but
starr
only
nodded
i
am
sure
you
will
not
mind
that
will
you
father
his
aunt
must
be
a
perfectly
good
and
nice
woman
and
such
a
long
drive
in
the
auto
and
to
see
all
over
des
moines
but
prudence
paused
guiltily
for
she
did
not
add
with
jerry
although
the
words
were
singing
in
her
heart
that
will
be
very
nice
indeed
and
of
course
i
do
not
object
it
will
be
a
forty
years
delight
and
wonder
to
the
twins
yes
i
will
be
glad
to
have
you
go
but
you
can
still
have
your
month
at
grace
if
you
wish
but
i
do
not
wish
protested
prudence
promptly
honestly
father
i
write
her
the
sweetest
kind
of
a
letter
but
oh
please
do
not
make
me
go
of
course
we
wo
make
you
go
you
goose
said
fairy
but
i
think
you
are
very
foolish
and
you
can
go
fairy
cried
prudence
hospitably
aunt
grace
loves
you
so
and
you
worked
so
hard
all
year
and
oh
yes
it
will
be
just
the
thing
for
you
prudence
wished
she
might
add
and
that
will
let
me
out
but
she
hardly
dare
say
it
well
when
does
your
des
moines
tour
come
off
i
must
know
so
i
can
tell
babbie
about
the
house
party
let
babbie
choose
his
own
date
jerry
says
we
shall
go
whenever
i
say
i
mean
whenever
you
say
father
and
we
can
decide
later
on
give
babbie
first
choice
by
all
means
that
was
the
beginning
of
prudence
golden
summer
she
was
not
given
to
she
did
what
seemed
good
to
her
always
she
did
not
delve
down
below
the
surface
for
reasons
why
and
wherefore
she
the
time
she
took
things
as
they
came
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
sharing
with
the
parsonage
family
even
the
least
ardent
and
most
prosaic
of
jerrold
letters
but
she
never
asked
herself
the
reason
it
seemed
a
positive
sacrilege
to
leave
his
warm
letters
in
a
bureau
drawer
it
was
only
natural
and
right
to
carry
them
in
her
dress
and
to
sleep
with
them
under
her
pillow
but
prudence
did
not
wonder
why
the
days
when
jerry
came
were
tremulously
happy
ones
for
her
she
was
all
aquiver
when
she
heard
him
swinging
briskly
up
the
ramshackle
parsonage
walk
and
her
breath
was
suffocatingly
hot
but
she
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
the
nights
when
jerry
slept
in
the
little
spare
bedroom
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
prudence
lay
awake
staring
joyously
into
the
darkness
hoping
jerry
was
sound
asleep
and
comfortable
but
she
never
asked
herself
why
she
could
not
sleep
she
knew
that
jerry
voice
was
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
she
knew
that
his
eyes
were
the
softest
and
brightest
and
the
most
tender
she
knew
that
his
hands
had
a
thrilling
touch
quite
different
from
the
touch
of
ordinary
less
dear
hands
she
knew
that
his
smile
lifted
her
into
a
delirium
of
delight
and
that
even
the
thought
of
sorrow
coming
to
him
brought
stinging
tears
to
her
eyes
but
why
ah
prudence
never
thought
of
that
she
just
lived
in
the
sweet
ecstatic
dream
of
the
summer
and
was
well
and
richly
content
so
the
vacation
passed
and
indian
summer
came
and
the
girls
went
back
to
their
studies
once
more
reluctantly
yet
unaccountably
glad
even
in
their
reluctance
it
is
always
that
way
with
students
real
students
they
regret
the
passing
of
vacation
days
but
the
thought
of
going
back
to
school
has
its
own
tingling
joys
of
anticipation
it
was
saturday
evening
the
early
supper
at
the
parsonage
was
over
the
twins
had
washed
the
dishes
and
still
the
daylight
lingered
prudence
and
jerry
sat
side
by
side
and
closely
on
the
front
porch
talking
in
whispers
fairy
had
gone
for
a
stroll
with
the
still
faithful
babbie
connie
and
the
twins
had
evidently
vanished
ah
not
quite
that
carol
and
lark
came
swiftly
around
the
corner
of
the
parsonage
good
evening
said
lark
politely
and
prudence
sat
up
abruptly
the
twins
never
wasted
politeness
they
wanted
something
do
you
mind
if
we
take
jerry
around
by
the
woodshed
for
a
few
minutes
prue
i
come
along
said
prudence
rising
oh
no
protested
lark
we
do
not
want
you
just
jerry
and
only
for
a
little
while
prudence
sniffed
suspiciously
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
him
she
demanded
we
wo
hurt
him
grinned
carol
impishly
we
had
intended
to
tie
him
to
a
stake
and
burn
him
alive
but
since
you
have
interceded
on
his
behalf
we
let
him
off
with
a
simple
scalping
maybe
he
afraid
to
come
said
lark
for
there
are
two
of
us
and
we
are
mighty
men
of
valor
that
all
right
prudence
answered
defensively
i
sooner
face
a
tribe
of
wild
indians
any
day
than
you
twins
when
you
are
oh
we
just
want
to
use
him
a
few
minutes
said
carol
impatiently
upon
our
honor
as
christian
gentlemen
we
promise
not
to
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
oh
come
along
and
cut
out
the
comedy
jerry
broke
in
laughing
i
be
back
in
two
minutes
prue
they
probably
want
me
to
shoo
a
chicken
out
of
their
way
or
maybe
the
cat
has
been
chasing
them
once
safely
around
the
corner
the
twins
changed
their
tactics
we
knew
you
were
afraid
said
lark
artistically
we
were
just
teasing
prudence
we
know
we
could
hurt
you
of
course
emphasized
carol
we
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
all
it
something
we
ca
do
ourselves
but
we
knew
you
could
do
it
all
right
jerry
perceived
the
drift
of
this
argument
i
see
i
paid
in
advance
for
my
service
what
the
job
then
the
twins
led
him
to
the
woodshed
this
woodshed
stood
about
twenty
feet
from
the
back
door
of
the
parsonage
and
was
nine
feet
high
in
front
the
roof
sloping
down
at
the
back
close
beside
the
shed
grew
a
tall
and
luxuriant
maple
the
lower
limbs
had
been
chopped
off
and
the
trunk
rose
clear
to
a
height
of
nearly
twelve
feet
before
the
massive
limbs
branched
out
the
twins
had
discovered
that
by
climbing
gingerly
on
the
rotten
roof
of
the
woodshed
followed
by
almost
superhuman
scrambling
and
scratching
they
could
get
up
into
the
leafy
secrecy
of
the
grand
old
maple
more
than
this
up
high
in
the
tree
they
found
a
delightful
arrangement
of
branches
that
seemed
positively
made
for
them
these
branches
must
be
utilized
and
it
was
in
the
act
of
utilizing
them
that
they
called
upon
their
sister
friend
for
help
do
you
see
this
board
began
lark
exhibiting
with
some
pride
a
solid
board
about
two
feet
in
length
my
eyesight
is
quite
unimpaired
answered
jerry
for
he
knew
his
twins
well
we
found
this
over
by
the
avery
barn
they
have
a
big
scrap
pile
out
there
we
could
find
anything
around
here
that
would
suit
so
we
looked
over
there
it
just
a
pile
of
rubbish
and
we
knew
they
would
mind
else
you
would
not
have
taken
it
eh
anything
like
apples
for
instance
is
quite
under
the
ban
yes
indeed
smiled
lark
we
too
old
to
steal
apples
of
course
added
carol
when
we
need
our
neighbor
apples
we
send
connie
and
get
nicely
punished
for
it
too
i
promise
you
quite
so
and
this
exquisite
board
well
we
found
a
perfectly
gorgeous
place
up
in
the
old
tree
where
we
can
make
a
seat
it
quite
a
ways
out
from
the
trunk
and
when
the
wind
blows
it
swings
splendidly
but
it
is
very
comfortable
sitting
on
a
thin
limb
and
so
we
want
a
seat
it
a
fine
place
i
tell
you
we
thought
you
could
nail
this
securely
on
to
the
limbs
there
are
two
right
near
each
other
evidently
put
there
on
purpose
for
us
see
what
dandy
big
nails
we
have
from
the
avery
woodshed
i
suppose
he
suggested
smiling
again
oh
they
are
quite
rusty
we
found
them
in
a
sack
in
an
old
barrel
it
was
in
the
scrap
heap
we
very
good
friends
with
the
averys
very
good
indeed
she
continued
hastily
they
allow
us
to
rummage
around
at
will
in
the
barn
and
see
this
rope
cried
carol
is
it
a
dandy
ah
the
avery
barn
must
be
inexhaustible
in
its
resources
how
suspicious
you
are
jerry
mourned
lark
i
wish
we
were
that
way
instead
of
innocent
and
bland
and
trustful
maybe
we
would
get
rich
too
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
really
understood
how
you
came
to
be
a
success
in
business
but
you
are
quite
wrong
this
time
said
lark
seriously
old
avery
gave
me
this
rope
yes
he
did
lark
told
him
she
was
looking
for
a
rope
just
exactly
like
this
one
and
then
he
gave
it
to
her
he
caught
the
idea
of
philanthropy
right
away
he
a
very
nice
old
gentleman
i
tell
you
he
so
trusting
and
unsuspicious
i
very
fond
of
people
like
that
we
thought
when
you
had
the
board
nicely
nailed
on
you
might
rope
it
securely
to
the
limbs
above
they
are
in
very
good
position
and
that
will
make
it
absolutely
safe
do
you
suppose
you
can
do
that
jerry
do
you
get
seasick
when
you
climb
high
oh
no
high
altitudes
never
make
me
seasick
i
a
very
good
head
for
such
purposes
then
suppose
you
get
busy
before
it
grows
dark
we
in
a
great
hurry
and
we
do
not
want
connie
to
catch
us
putting
it
up
it
be
such
fun
to
sit
up
there
and
swing
when
the
wind
blows
and
have
poor
connie
down
beneath
wondering
how
we
manage
to
stick
on
she
ca
see
the
seat
from
the
ground
wo
it
be
a
good
joke
on
her
oh
very
well
let
now
observe
i
will
just
loop
this
end
of
the
rope
lightly
about
my
er
middle
the
other
end
will
dangle
on
the
ground
to
be
drawn
up
at
will
observe
also
that
i
bestow
the
good
but
rusty
nails
in
this
pocket
and
the
hammer
here
then
with
the
admirable
board
beneath
my
arm
i
mount
to
the
heights
of
say
twins
did
i
see
an
old
buggy
seat
out
in
the
barn
seems
to
me
oh
jerry
the
twins
fairly
smothered
him
oh
you
darling
you
are
the
nicest
old
now
we
can
understand
why
prudence
seems
to
like
you
we
never
once
thought
of
the
old
buggy
seat
oh
jerry
then
they
hastily
brought
the
discarded
seat
from
the
barn
and
with
the
help
of
jerry
it
was
shoved
up
on
the
woodshed
from
there
he
lifted
it
to
the
lowest
limb
of
the
old
maple
and
a
second
later
he
was
up
himself
then
it
was
lifted
again
and
again
he
followed
up
and
up
and
up
the
loose
end
of
the
donated
rope
trailing
loose
on
the
ground
below
the
twins
promptly
as
promptly
as
possible
that
is
followed
him
into
the
tree
oh
yes
we
come
along
we
used
to
climbing
and
we
very
agile
and
you
will
need
us
to
hold
things
steady
while
you
hammer
and
jerry
smiled
as
he
heard
the
faithful
twins
with
much
grunting
and
an
occasional
groan
following
in
his
wake
it
was
a
delightful
location
as
they
had
said
so
heavy
was
the
leafy
screen
that
only
by
lifting
a
branch
here
or
there
could
they
see
through
it
the
big
seat
fitted
nicely
on
the
two
limbs
and
jerry
fastened
it
with
the
rusty
nails
the
twins
were
jubilant
and
loud
in
their
praises
of
his
skill
and
courage
oh
jerry
exclaimed
carol
with
deep
satisfaction
it
such
a
blessing
to
discover
something
really
nice
about
you
after
all
these
months
now
we
just
hush
hissed
lark
here
comes
connie
hold
your
breath
jerry
and
do
budge
is
she
in
on
this
he
whispered
he
could
hear
connie
making
weird
noises
as
she
came
around
the
house
from
the
front
she
was
learning
to
whistle
and
the
effect
was
ghastly
in
the
extreme
connie
mouth
had
not
been
designed
for
whistling
sh
she
the
band
of
gypsies
trying
to
steal
my
lovely
wife
i
the
lovely
wife
interrupted
carol
complacently
but
connie
does
not
know
about
it
she
is
so
religious
she
wo
be
any
of
the
villain
parts
when
we
want
her
to
be
anything
real
we
have
to
do
it
on
the
sly
she
would
no
more
consent
to
a
band
of
gypsies
than
she
would
connie
came
around
the
corner
of
the
parsonage
out
the
back
walk
beneath
the
maple
then
she
gave
a
gleeful
scream
right
before
her
lay
a
beautiful
heavy
rope
connie
had
been
yearning
for
a
good
rope
to
make
a
swing
here
it
lay
at
her
very
feet
plainly
a
gift
of
the
gods
she
did
not
wait
to
see
where
the
other
end
of
the
rope
was
she
just
grabbed
what
she
saw
before
her
and
started
violently
back
around
the
house
with
it
yelling
prudence
look
at
my
rope
prudence
rushed
around
the
parsonage
the
twins
shrieked
wildly
as
there
was
a
terrific
tug
and
heave
of
the
limb
beside
them
and
then
a
crashing
of
branches
and
leaves
jerry
was
gone
it
did
look
horrible
from
above
as
well
as
below
but
jerry
when
he
felt
the
first
light
twinge
as
connie
lifted
the
rope
foresaw
what
was
coming
and
was
ready
for
it
as
he
went
down
he
grabbed
a
firm
hold
on
the
branch
on
which
he
had
stood
then
he
dropped
to
the
next
and
held
again
on
the
lowest
limb
he
really
clung
for
fifteen
seconds
and
took
in
his
bearings
connie
had
dropped
the
rope
when
the
twins
screamed
so
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
her
he
saw
prudence
white
with
wild
eyes
both
arms
stretched
out
toward
him
prue
he
called
and
then
he
dropped
he
landed
on
his
feet
a
little
jolted
but
none
the
worse
for
his
fall
he
ran
at
once
to
prudence
i
all
right
he
cried
really
alarmed
by
the
white
horror
in
her
face
prudence
prudence
then
her
arms
dropped
and
with
a
brave
but
feeble
smile
she
swayed
a
little
jerry
took
her
in
his
arms
sweetheart
he
whispered
little
sweetheart
do
do
you
love
me
so
much
my
dearest
prudence
raised
her
hands
to
his
face
and
looked
intensely
into
his
eyes
all
the
sweet
loving
soul
of
her
shining
in
her
own
and
jerry
kissed
her
the
twins
scrambled
down
from
the
maple
speechless
and
cold
with
terror
and
saw
prudence
and
jerry
then
they
saw
connie
staring
at
them
with
interest
and
amusement
i
think
we
better
go
to
bed
all
three
of
us
declared
lark
sturdily
and
they
set
off
heroically
around
the
house
but
at
the
corner
carol
turned
take
my
advice
and
go
into
the
woodshed
she
said
for
all
the
averys
are
looking
out
of
their
windows
prudence
did
not
hear
but
he
drew
her
swiftly
into
the
woodshed
now
a
woodshed
is
a
hideously
unromantic
sort
of
place
and
there
was
nothing
for
prudence
to
sit
on
that
jerry
might
kneel
at
her
feet
so
they
dispensed
with
formalities
and
he
held
her
in
his
arms
for
a
long
time
and
kissed
her
often
and
whispered
sweet
meaningless
words
that
thrilled
her
as
she
listened
it
may
not
have
been
comfortable
but
it
was
evidently
endurable
for
it
is
a
fact
that
they
did
not
leave
that
woodshed
for
over
an
hour
then
they
betook
themselves
to
the
darkest
corner
of
the
side
porch
and
history
repeated
itself
once
more
at
twelve
jerry
went
to
bed
his
lips
tingling
with
the
fervent
tenderness
of
her
parting
kiss
at
one
he
stood
at
his
window
looking
soberly
out
into
the
moonlit
parsonage
yard
she
is
an
angel
a
pure
sweet
unselfish
little
angel
he
whispered
and
his
voice
was
broken
and
his
eyes
were
wet
and
she
is
going
to
be
my
wife
oh
god
teach
me
how
to
be
good
to
her
and
help
me
make
her
as
happy
as
she
deserves
at
two
he
lay
on
his
bed
staring
into
the
darkness
thinking
again
the
soft
shy
words
she
had
whispered
to
him
and
he
flung
his
arms
out
toward
his
closed
door
wanting
her
at
three
he
dropped
lightly
asleep
and
dreamed
of
her
with
the
first
pale
streaks
of
daylight
stealing
into
his
room
he
awoke
it
was
after
four
a
little
later
just
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
a
light
tap
on
his
door
it
came
again
and
he
bounded
out
of
bed
prudence
is
anything
wrong
hush
jerry
not
so
loud
and
what
a
strange
and
weary
voice
come
will
you
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
wait
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
be
quiet
do
not
wake
father
and
the
girls
will
you
be
down
soon
in
two
minutes
and
in
two
minutes
he
was
flown
agonizingly
anxious
knowing
that
something
was
wrong
prudence
was
waiting
for
him
and
as
he
reached
the
bottom
step
she
clutched
his
hands
desperately
jerry
she
whispered
i
forgive
me
i
honestly
oh
i
think
what
i
was
saying
last
night
you
were
so
dear
and
i
was
so
happy
and
for
a
while
i
really
believed
we
could
belong
to
each
other
but
i
ca
you
know
i
promised
papa
and
the
girls
a
dozen
times
that
i
would
never
marry
do
you
see
how
it
is
i
must
take
it
back
jerry
smiled
a
little
it
must
be
admitted
this
was
so
like
his
conscientious
little
prudence
dearest
he
said
gently
you
have
said
that
because
you
were
not
awake
you
did
not
love
but
you
are
awake
now
you
love
me
your
father
would
never
allow
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
like
that
the
girls
would
not
hear
of
it
they
want
you
to
be
happy
and
you
be
happy
without
me
can
you
suddenly
she
crushed
close
to
him
oh
jerry
she
sobbed
i
will
never
be
happy
again
i
know
but
it
is
right
for
me
to
stay
here
and
be
the
mother
in
the
parsonage
it
is
wicked
of
me
to
want
you
more
than
all
of
them
do
you
see
it
is
they
have
any
mother
they
have
any
one
but
me
of
course
they
would
not
allow
it
but
they
will
not
know
anything
about
it
i
must
do
it
myself
and
father
especially
must
never
know
i
want
you
to
go
away
this
morning
before
breakfast
and
never
come
again
she
clung
to
him
as
she
said
this
but
her
voice
did
not
falter
and
you
must
not
write
to
me
any
more
for
oh
jerry
if
i
see
you
again
i
can
never
let
you
go
i
know
it
will
you
do
this
for
me
you
been
up
all
night
have
you
dearest
yes
i
remembered
and
then
i
could
sleep
what
have
you
been
doing
all
night
it
is
morning
now
i
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
and
pounded
my
hands
together
she
admitted
with
a
mournful
smile
you
are
nervous
and
excited
he
said
tenderly
let
wait
until
after
breakfast
then
we
talk
it
all
over
with
your
father
and
it
shall
be
as
he
says
wo
that
be
better
oh
no
for
father
will
say
whatever
he
thinks
will
make
me
happy
he
must
not
know
a
thing
about
it
promise
jerry
that
you
will
never
tell
him
one
word
i
promise
of
course
prudence
i
will
let
you
tell
him
but
she
shook
her
head
he
will
never
know
oh
jerry
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
never
seeing
you
again
and
never
getting
letters
from
you
and
it
seems
to
kill
me
inside
just
the
thought
of
it
sit
down
here
in
my
lap
put
your
head
on
my
shoulder
like
that
let
me
rub
your
face
a
little
you
feverish
you
are
sick
go
to
bed
wo
you
sweetheart
we
can
settle
this
later
on
you
must
go
right
away
or
i
can
not
let
you
go
at
all
do
you
mean
you
want
me
to
get
my
things
and
go
right
now
yes
she
buried
her
face
in
his
shoulder
if
if
you
stay
in
your
room
until
breakfast
time
i
will
lock
you
in
so
you
can
not
leave
me
again
i
know
it
i
am
crazy
do
you
think
you
owe
me
something
as
well
as
your
father
and
sisters
did
god
bring
us
together
and
make
us
love
each
other
do
you
think
he
intended
us
for
each
other
do
you
wish
you
had
never
met
me
jerry
then
sweetheart
be
reasonable
your
father
loved
your
mother
and
married
her
that
is
god
plan
for
all
of
us
you
have
been
a
wonderfully
brave
and
sweet
daughter
and
sister
i
know
but
surely
fairy
is
old
enough
to
take
your
place
now
fairy
going
to
be
a
professor
and
the
girls
do
not
mind
her
very
well
and
she
is
as
much
comfort
to
father
as
i
it
just
because
i
am
most
like
mother
you
see
but
anyhow
i
promised
i
ca
leave
them
your
father
expects
you
to
marry
and
to
marry
me
i
told
him
about
it
myself
long
ago
and
he
was
perfectly
willing
he
did
say
a
word
against
it
of
course
he
would
that
just
like
father
but
still
i
promised
and
what
would
the
girls
say
if
i
should
go
back
on
them
they
have
trusted
me
always
if
i
fail
them
will
they
ever
trust
anybody
else
if
you
love
me
jerry
please
go
and
stay
away
but
her
arm
tightened
about
his
neck
i
wait
here
until
you
get
your
things
and
we
can
say
and
do
forget
your
promise
oh
very
well
prudence
he
answered
half
irritably
if
you
insist
on
ordering
me
away
from
the
house
like
this
i
can
only
go
but
let
not
talk
any
more
about
it
jerry
please
i
wait
until
you
come
down
when
he
came
down
a
little
later
with
his
suitcase
his
face
was
white
and
strained
she
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
jerry
she
whispered
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
could
go
away
with
you
and
never
see
any
of
them
any
more
or
papa
or
the
parsonage
and
still
feel
rich
if
i
just
had
you
you
everything
in
me
seems
to
be
all
yours
i
love
you
her
tremulous
lips
were
pressed
against
his
oh
sweetheart
this
is
folly
all
folly
but
i
ca
make
you
see
it
it
is
wrong
it
is
wickedly
wrong
but
but
i
am
all
they
have
jerry
and
i
promised
whenever
you
want
me
prudence
just
send
i
never
change
always
be
just
the
same
god
intended
you
for
me
i
know
and
i
be
waiting
jerry
jerry
jerry
she
whispered
passionately
sobbing
quivering
in
his
arms
it
was
he
who
drew
away
sweetheart
he
said
quietly
great
pity
in
his
heart
for
the
girl
who
in
her
desire
to
do
right
was
doing
such
horrible
wrong
sweetheart
remember
i
will
be
waiting
whenever
you
send
i
will
come
he
stepped
outside
and
closed
the
door
prudence
stood
motionless
her
hands
clenched
until
she
could
no
longer
hear
his
footsteps
then
she
dropped
on
the
floor
and
lay
there
face
downward
until
she
heard
fairy
moving
in
her
room
then
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
built
the
fire
for
breakfast
chapter
xiv
she
comes
to
grief
fairy
was
one
of
those
buoyant
girls
to
whom
sleep
is
indeed
the
great
restorer
she
slept
soundly
sweetly
dreamlessly
and
every
morning
she
ran
so
full
of
animation
and
life
that
she
seemed
all
atingle
to
her
now
she
stood
in
the
kitchen
door
tall
cheeks
glowing
eyes
sparkling
and
smiled
at
her
sister
solemn
back
you
are
the
little
mousey
prue
she
said
in
her
full
rich
voice
i
did
hear
you
come
to
bed
last
night
and
i
did
hear
you
getting
out
this
morning
i
am
an
abominably
solid
sleeper
am
i
not
shall
i
get
the
maple
sirup
for
the
pancakes
i
wonder
if
jerry
knows
we
only
use
maple
sirup
when
he
is
here
i
constantly
expecting
connie
to
give
it
away
why
am
i
always
so
ravenously
hungry
in
the
morning
goodness
knows
i
eat
enough
why
what
is
the
matter
for
prudence
had
turned
her
face
toward
her
sister
and
it
was
so
white
and
so
unnatural
that
fairy
was
shocked
prudence
you
are
sick
go
to
bed
and
let
me
get
breakfast
why
did
you
call
me
i
real
angry
at
you
prudence
starr
here
get
out
of
this
and
i
will
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
i
had
a
headache
and
did
not
sleep
but
i
am
all
right
now
yes
bring
the
sirup
fairy
are
the
girls
up
yet
fairy
eyed
her
suspiciously
jerry
is
out
unusually
early
too
he
his
door
is
open
i
did
hear
him
coming
down
so
he
must
have
quite
outdone
himself
he
generally
has
to
be
called
twice
jerry
has
gone
fairy
prudence
back
was
presented
to
view
once
more
and
prudence
was
stirring
the
oatmeal
with
vicious
energy
he
left
early
this
morning
i
suppose
he
is
to
des
moines
by
now
oh
fairy
voice
was
will
you
get
the
sirup
now
yes
of
when
is
he
coming
back
he
is
coming
back
please
hurry
fairy
and
then
call
the
others
the
oatmeal
is
ready
fairy
went
soberly
down
cellar
and
brought
up
the
golden
sirup
then
ostensibly
to
call
her
sisters
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
girls
she
began
carefully
closing
the
door
of
their
room
behind
her
jerry
has
gone
and
is
coming
back
any
more
and
for
goodness
sake
do
keep
asking
questions
about
it
just
eat
your
breakfast
as
usual
and
have
a
little
tact
gone
yes
a
lovers
quarrel
suggested
lark
and
her
eyes
glittered
greedily
nothing
of
the
sort
and
do
keep
staring
at
prue
either
and
do
not
keep
talking
about
jerry
all
the
time
you
mind
me
or
i
will
tell
papa
that
funny
said
carol
thoughtfully
we
left
them
kissing
each
other
like
mad
in
the
back
yard
last
night
and
this
morning
he
has
gone
to
return
no
more
they
are
crazy
kissing
in
the
back
yard
what
are
you
talking
about
carol
explained
and
fairy
looked
still
more
thoughtful
and
perturbed
she
opened
the
door
and
called
out
to
them
in
a
loud
and
breezy
voice
hurry
girls
for
breakfast
is
ready
and
there
no
time
to
waste
in
a
parsonage
on
sunday
morning
then
she
added
in
a
whisper
and
do
you
mention
jerry
and
do
ask
prudence
what
makes
her
so
pale
or
you
catch
it
then
she
went
to
her
father
door
breakfast
is
ready
papa
she
called
clearly
she
turned
the
knob
softly
and
peeped
in
may
i
come
in
a
minute
standing
close
beside
him
she
told
him
all
she
knew
of
what
had
happened
prudence
is
ghastly
father
just
ghastly
and
she
ca
talk
about
it
yet
so
be
careful
what
you
say
will
you
and
it
was
due
to
fairy
kindly
admonitions
that
the
parsonage
family
took
the
departure
of
jerry
so
calmly
fairy
says
jerry
took
the
morning
train
said
starr
as
they
were
passing
the
cream
and
sugar
for
the
oatmeal
that
is
too
bad
but
it
is
just
the
worst
of
being
a
business
man
one
never
knows
when
one
must
be
up
and
away
and
of
course
one
can
not
neglect
business
the
oatmeal
is
unusually
good
this
morning
prudence
this
was
nothing
short
of
heroic
on
his
part
for
her
eyes
upon
her
father
face
were
so
wide
and
dark
that
the
lump
in
his
throat
would
not
stay
down
that
was
the
beginning
of
prudence
bitter
winter
when
the
brightest
sunshine
was
cheerless
and
dreary
and
when
even
the
laughter
of
her
sisters
smote
harshly
upon
her
ears
she
tried
to
be
as
always
but
in
her
eyes
the
wounded
look
lingered
and
her
face
grew
so
pale
and
thin
that
her
father
and
fairy
anxiously
watching
were
filled
with
grave
concern
she
remained
almost
constantly
in
the
parsonage
reading
very
little
sitting
most
of
her
leisure
time
staring
out
the
windows
fairy
had
tried
to
win
her
confidence
and
had
failed
you
are
a
darling
fairy
but
i
really
do
not
want
to
talk
about
oh
no
indeed
it
is
all
my
own
fault
i
told
him
to
go
and
not
come
no
you
are
wrong
fairy
i
do
not
regret
it
i
do
not
want
him
to
come
any
more
and
fairy
worried
what
in
the
world
had
happened
to
separate
in
the
morning
these
two
who
had
been
kissing
so
frankly
in
the
back
yard
the
evening
before
starr
too
had
tried
prudence
he
said
gently
you
know
very
often
men
do
things
that
to
women
seem
wrong
and
wicked
and
maybe
they
are
but
men
and
women
are
different
by
nature
my
dear
and
we
must
remember
that
i
have
satisfied
myself
that
jerry
is
good
and
clean
and
manly
i
do
not
think
you
should
let
any
foolishness
of
his
in
the
past
come
between
you
now
you
are
mistaken
father
jerry
is
all
right
and
always
was
i
am
sure
it
is
nothing
like
that
i
told
him
to
go
and
not
to
come
again
that
is
all
but
if
he
should
come
back
now
it
would
be
just
the
same
do
worry
about
it
father
it
all
right
prudence
he
said
more
tenderly
we
have
been
the
closest
of
friends
and
companions
you
and
i
from
the
very
beginning
always
you
have
come
to
me
with
your
troubles
and
worries
have
i
ever
failed
you
why
then
do
you
go
back
on
me
now
when
you
really
need
me
prudence
patted
his
shoulder
affectionately
but
her
eyes
did
not
meet
his
i
do
not
really
need
you
now
father
it
is
all
settled
and
i
am
quite
satisfied
things
are
all
right
with
me
just
as
they
are
then
he
took
a
serious
step
without
her
knowledge
he
went
to
des
moines
and
had
a
visit
with
jerry
he
found
him
thinner
his
face
sterner
his
eyes
darker
when
the
office
boy
announced
starr
jerry
ran
quickly
out
to
greet
him
is
she
all
right
he
cried
eagerly
almost
before
he
was
within
hailing
distance
starr
did
not
mince
matters
jerry
he
said
abruptly
did
you
and
prudence
have
a
quarrel
she
declines
to
tell
me
anything
about
it
and
after
the
conversations
you
and
i
have
had
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
know
what
has
happened
does
she
miss
me
does
she
seem
sorry
that
i
am
away
does
his
voice
was
so
boyish
and
so
eager
there
was
no
mistaking
his
attitude
toward
prudence
look
here
jerry
i
want
to
know
why
are
you
staying
away
wo
prudence
tell
you
no
then
i
can
not
she
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
you
a
word
but
it
is
not
my
fault
starr
i
can
tell
you
that
it
is
nothing
i
have
done
or
said
she
sent
me
away
because
she
thinks
it
was
right
for
her
to
do
so
and
you
know
prudence
it
is
wrong
i
know
i
knew
it
all
the
time
but
i
could
make
her
see
it
and
she
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
in
the
end
starr
went
back
to
the
parsonage
no
wiser
than
he
left
save
that
he
now
knew
that
jerry
was
really
not
to
blame
and
that
he
held
himself
ready
to
return
to
her
on
a
moment
notice
the
ladies
of
the
methodist
church
were
puzzled
and
exasperated
they
went
to
the
parsonage
determined
to
find
out
what
what
but
when
they
sat
with
prudence
and
looked
at
the
frail
pathetic
little
figure
with
the
mournful
eyes
could
only
sigh
with
her
and
go
their
ways
the
twins
continued
to
play
in
the
great
maple
even
when
the
leaves
were
fallen
it
a
dandy
place
i
tell
you
prudence
cried
carol
jerry
did
have
time
to
put
up
the
rope
before
connie
pulled
him
down
but
we
fixed
it
ourselves
and
it
is
simply
grand
you
can
go
up
and
swing
any
time
you
like
unless
your
joints
are
too
stiff
it
a
very
serious
matter
getting
up
there
stiff
joints
of
course
i
mean
lark
and
i
get
up
easy
enough
for
a
moment
prudence
sat
silent
with
quivering
lips
then
she
burst
out
with
unusual
passion
do
you
ever
dare
climb
up
in
that
tree
again
as
long
as
you
live
twins
mind
what
i
say
lark
looked
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
and
carol
swallowed
hard
it
was
she
who
said
gently
why
of
course
prue
just
as
you
say
for
the
first
time
prudence
had
dealt
with
them
harshly
and
unfairly
they
knew
it
there
was
neither
sense
nor
justice
in
her
command
but
they
did
not
argue
the
point
they
kept
their
eyes
considerately
away
from
her
and
buried
themselves
in
it
must
be
remembered
the
twins
are
sophomores
now
five
minutes
later
prudence
spoke
again
humbly
i
beg
you
pardon
twins
that
was
a
perfectly
idiotic
thing
for
me
to
say
of
course
you
may
play
in
the
maple
whenever
you
like
but
be
careful
you
could
save
yourselves
in
falling
as
as
men
can
we
wo
play
there
if
you
want
us
not
to
said
carol
kindly
i
do
want
you
to
play
there
she
answered
it
a
very
nice
place
and
great
fun
i
know
i
might
try
it
myself
if
my
joints
were
so
stiff
now
go
on
with
your
latin
but
prudence
did
not
pass
under
the
maple
for
many
weeks
without
clenching
her
hands
and
shuddering
the
twins
were
not
satisfied
they
marveled
and
wondered
and
pondered
over
the
subject
of
jerry
disappearance
finally
they
felt
it
was
more
than
human
flesh
could
stand
they
would
approach
prudence
on
the
subject
themselves
but
they
bided
their
time
they
must
wait
until
fairy
was
safely
out
of
the
house
fairy
these
days
had
an
infuriating
way
of
saying
that
will
do
twins
you
better
go
and
play
now
it
enraged
and
distracted
the
twins
almost
to
the
point
of
committing
crime
they
had
made
several
artistic
moves
already
professor
duke
of
their
freshman
biology
class
had
written
carol
a
gay
long
letter
and
carol
was
enthusiastic
about
it
she
and
lark
talked
of
dear
old
duck
for
two
weeks
almost
without
pausing
for
sleep
i
sure
you
would
fall
in
love
with
him
on
the
spot
carol
had
said
to
prudence
suggestively
prudence
had
only
smiled
evidently
in
sarcasm
jerry
was
very
nice
oh
very
nice
but
you
ought
to
see
our
little
duck
carol
rattled
rashly
i
sure
you
would
regret
jerry
any
more
if
you
could
just
get
hold
of
duckie
of
course
his
being
in
new
york
is
an
obstacle
but
i
could
introduce
you
by
mail
i
do
not
care
for
ducks
said
prudence
of
course
they
look
very
nice
swimming
around
on
the
water
but
when
it
comes
to
eating
take
spring
chicken
every
time
carol
did
not
mention
duck
again
for
three
days
but
there
came
a
day
when
fairy
was
out
in
the
country
connie
had
gone
driving
with
her
father
the
moment
had
arrived
the
twins
had
their
plan
of
campaign
memorized
and
they
sauntered
in
to
prudence
with
a
nonchalance
that
was
all
assumed
prudence
lark
began
we
writing
a
book
that
nice
said
prudence
conversation
languished
the
subject
seemed
exhausted
carol
came
to
the
rescue
it
a
very
nice
book
it
a
and
perfectly
thrilling
larkie
does
the
writing
but
i
criticize
and
offer
suggestions
that
kind
of
you
a
pause
i
going
to
dedicate
it
to
carol
to
my
beloved
sister
to
whose
kindness
and
sympathy
i
owe
all
that
i
am
or
something
like
that
lark
explained
hopefully
how
proud
carol
will
be
a
long
pause
we
in
a
very
critical
place
just
now
though
lark
seemed
to
be
commencing
at
the
beginning
once
more
we
have
our
heroine
in
a
very
peculiar
situation
and
we
ca
think
what
to
do
with
her
next
how
sad
another
pause
we
thought
maybe
you
could
help
us
out
i
afraid
not
prudence
smiled
a
little
i
have
any
imagination
ask
fairy
she
strong
on
maybe
if
we
explain
the
situation
to
you
you
could
give
us
a
suggestion
it
is
like
this
the
young
people
have
had
all
kinds
of
thrilling
experiences
but
they
are
not
yet
betrothed
but
they
are
just
on
the
point
of
getting
there
and
something
crops
up
all
of
a
sudden
the
hero
goes
dashing
away
and
returns
no
more
the
heroine
lies
upon
her
silken
couch
weeping
weeping
and
no
one
knows
what
to
do
about
it
because
no
one
knows
what
has
happened
what
do
you
suppose
could
have
sent
the
lover
away
like
that
maybe
he
has
enough
money
for
the
heroine
oh
yes
he
very
rich
maybe
he
is
already
married
no
indeed
he
a
bachelor
maybe
he
did
love
her
after
all
here
carol
chimed
in
helpfully
oh
yes
he
did
for
we
left
him
kissing
her
all
over
the
back
yard
and
he
would
have
done
that
if
he
had
loved
her
you
know
prudence
eyes
twinkled
a
little
but
her
smile
was
sad
now
what
would
you
advise
us
to
do
inquired
lark
briskly
feeling
instinctively
that
carol
had
explained
too
much
prudence
rose
slowly
i
think
she
said
very
gently
i
think
i
would
burn
the
book
if
i
were
you
and
pay
a
little
more
attention
to
my
studies
then
she
went
and
carol
told
lark
sympathetically
that
they
did
not
deserve
an
authoress
in
the
parsonage
when
they
did
give
her
any
more
encouragement
than
that
on
the
day
before
christmas
an
insured
package
was
delivered
at
the
parsonage
for
prudence
a
letter
was
with
it
and
she
read
that
first
my
dearest
little
sweetheart
i
chose
this
gift
for
you
long
before
i
had
the
right
to
do
it
i
was
keeping
it
until
the
proper
moment
but
the
moment
came
and
went
again
still
i
want
you
to
have
the
gift
please
wear
it
for
my
sake
for
i
shall
be
happy
knowing
it
is
where
it
ought
to
be
even
though
i
myself
am
banished
i
love
you
prudence
whenever
you
send
for
me
i
am
ready
to
come
entirely
and
always
yours
jerry
with
trembling
fingers
she
opened
the
little
package
it
contained
a
ring
with
a
brilliant
diamond
flashing
myriad
colors
before
her
eyes
and
prudence
kissed
it
passionately
many
times
two
hours
later
she
went
quietly
to
where
the
rest
of
the
family
were
decorating
a
christmas
tree
she
showed
the
ring
to
them
gravely
jerry
sent
it
to
me
she
said
do
you
think
it
is
all
right
for
me
to
wear
it
father
a
thrill
of
hopeful
expectancy
ran
through
the
little
group
yes
indeed
declared
her
father
how
beautiful
it
is
is
jerry
coming
to
spend
christmas
with
us
why
no
father
he
is
not
coming
at
all
any
more
i
thought
you
understood
that
an
awkward
silence
and
carol
came
brightly
to
the
rescue
it
certainly
is
a
beauty
i
thought
it
was
very
kind
of
professor
duckie
to
send
lark
and
me
a
box
of
chocolates
but
of
course
this
is
ever
so
much
nicer
jerry
a
bird
i
say
a
bird
mocked
fairy
such
language
lark
came
to
her
twin
defense
yes
a
bird
that
just
what
he
is
carol
smiled
we
saw
him
use
his
wings
when
connie
yanked
him
out
of
the
big
maple
did
we
lark
then
did
you
send
him
anything
prue
prudence
hesitated
and
answered
without
the
slightest
accession
of
color
yes
carol
i
had
my
picture
taken
when
i
was
in
burlington
and
sent
it
to
him
your
picture
oh
prudence
where
are
they
are
you
going
to
give
us
one
no
carol
i
had
only
one
made
for
jerry
there
are
any
more
well
sighed
lark
resignedly
it
a
pretty
idea
for
my
book
anyhow
from
that
day
on
prudence
always
wore
the
sparkling
ring
and
the
women
of
the
methodist
church
nearly
had
mental
paralysis
marveling
over
a
man
who
gave
a
diamond
ring
and
never
came
and
a
girl
who
accepted
and
wore
his
offering
with
nothing
to
say
for
the
man
and
it
was
the
consensus
of
opinion
in
mount
mark
that
modern
lovers
were
mostly
crazy
anyhow
and
springtime
came
again
now
the
twins
were
always
original
in
their
amusements
they
never
followed
blindly
after
the
dictates
of
custom
when
other
girls
were
playing
dolls
the
twins
were
a
tribe
of
wild
indians
when
other
girls
were
jumping
the
rope
the
twins
were
conducting
a
circus
and
when
other
girls
played
catch
with
dainty
rubber
balls
the
twins
took
unto
themselves
a
big
and
heavy
croquet
ball
found
in
the
avery
woodshed
to
be
sure
it
stung
and
bruised
their
hands
what
matter
at
any
rate
they
continued
endangering
their
lives
and
beauties
by
reckless
pitching
of
the
ungainly
plaything
one
friday
evening
after
school
they
were
amusing
themselves
on
the
parsonage
lawn
with
this
huge
ball
when
their
father
turned
in
they
ran
up
to
him
with
a
sporting
proposition
bet
you
a
nickel
papa
cried
carol
that
you
ca
throw
this
ball
as
far
as
the
schoolhouse
woodshed
by
the
way
will
you
lend
me
a
nickel
papa
he
took
the
ball
and
weighed
it
lightly
in
his
hand
i
an
society
he
declared
laughing
but
i
very
strongly
believe
it
will
carry
to
the
schoolhouse
woodshed
if
it
does
not
i
give
you
five
cents
worth
of
candy
and
if
it
does
you
shall
put
an
extra
nickel
in
the
collection
next
sunday
then
he
drew
back
his
arm
and
carefully
sighted
across
the
lawn
i
send
it
right
between
the
corner
of
the
house
and
that
little
cedar
he
said
and
then
bending
low
it
whizzed
from
his
hand
lark
screamed
and
carol
sank
fainting
to
the
ground
for
an
instant
starr
himself
stood
swaying
then
he
rushed
across
the
lawn
for
prudence
had
opened
the
front
door
and
stepped
quickly
out
on
the
walk
by
the
corner
of
the
house
the
heavy
ball
struck
her
on
the
forehead
and
she
fell
heavily
without
a
moan
chapter
xv
fate
takes
charge
four
hours
prudence
lay
unconscious
with
two
doctors
in
close
attendance
fairy
alert
but
calm
was
at
hand
to
give
them
service
it
is
a
significant
thing
that
in
bitter
anguish
and
grief
christians
find
comfort
and
peace
in
prayer
outsiders
as
well
as
christians
pray
in
times
of
danger
and
mental
stress
but
here
is
the
big
difference
between
the
prayers
of
christians
and
the
prayers
of
others
others
pray
and
pray
and
pray
again
and
continue
still
in
the
agony
and
passion
of
grief
and
fear
and
yet
they
pray
but
christians
pray
and
find
confidence
and
serenity
sorrow
may
remain
but
anguish
is
stilled
mount
mark
considered
this
a
unique
parsonage
family
their
liveliness
their
gaiety
their
love
of
fun
seemed
a
little
inapropos
in
the
setting
of
a
methodist
parsonage
they
ai
sanctimonious
enough
by
half
declared
old
harvey
reel
the
bus
driver
but
by
jings
i
tell
you
they
are
dandies
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
one
of
the
family
from
connie
up
had
a
characteristic
parsonage
heart
when
they
were
worried
or
frightened
or
grieved
they
prayed
fairy
passing
up
the
stairs
with
hot
water
for
the
doctors
whispered
to
her
father
as
he
turned
in
to
his
own
room
keep
on
praying
father
i
ca
stop
now
because
they
need
me
but
i
praying
every
minute
between
errands
and
starr
kneeling
beside
his
bed
did
pray
and
the
stony
despair
in
his
eyes
died
out
and
he
came
from
the
little
room
quiet
and
confident
and
calm
connie
had
been
unfortunate
in
seeking
a
secluded
corner
to
pray
for
prudence
she
had
passed
the
door
of
the
dungeon
and
paused
a
fitting
place
so
she
turned
in
at
once
drawing
the
door
after
her
but
leaving
it
a
couple
of
inches
ajar
then
in
the
farthest
and
darkest
corner
she
knelt
on
the
hard
floor
and
prayed
and
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
fairy
passing
through
the
hall
observed
the
door
ajar
and
gave
it
a
slight
push
the
lock
snapped
into
place
but
connie
did
not
waken
lark
remained
loyally
with
carol
until
consciousness
returned
to
her
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
walk
the
two
went
silently
to
the
barn
and
climbed
into
the
haymow
there
they
lay
flat
on
the
hay
faces
downward
each
with
an
arm
across
the
other
shoulder
praying
fervently
after
a
time
they
rose
and
crept
into
the
house
where
they
waited
patiently
until
fairy
came
down
on
one
of
her
numerous
errands
is
she
better
they
whispered
and
fairy
answered
gently
i
think
she
is
a
little
better
then
the
twins
in
no
way
deceived
went
back
to
the
haymow
again
fairy
prepared
a
hasty
supper
and
arranged
it
on
the
kitchen
table
she
drank
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
and
went
in
search
of
her
father
go
and
eat
dadsie
she
urged
but
he
shook
his
head
i
am
not
hungry
but
send
the
girls
to
the
table
at
once
on
their
next
trip
into
the
house
fairy
stopped
the
twins
get
connie
and
eat
your
supper
it
just
a
cold
lunch
and
is
already
on
the
kitchen
table
you
must
help
yourselves
i
ca
come
now
the
twins
did
not
speak
and
fairy
went
hurriedly
up
the
stairs
once
more
i
do
not
think
i
can
eat
said
carol
i
know
i
ca
was
lark
reply
wo
fairy
make
us
she
tell
papa
we
better
take
away
about
half
of
this
food
and
hide
it
then
she
will
think
we
have
already
eaten
this
novel
plan
was
acted
upon
with
promptitude
where
connie
she
ought
to
eat
something
we
must
make
her
do
it
she
probably
cried
herself
to
sleep
somewhere
we
better
let
her
alone
she
feel
much
better
asleep
and
hungry
than
awake
and
sorry
for
prue
so
the
twins
went
back
to
the
haymow
when
it
grew
dark
they
slipped
into
the
kitchen
and
huddled
together
on
the
woodbox
beside
the
stove
and
down
to
them
presently
came
fairy
smiling
her
eyes
she
is
better
cried
carol
springing
to
her
feet
yes
said
fairy
dropping
on
her
knees
and
burying
her
face
in
lap
as
she
still
sat
on
the
woodbox
she
better
she
is
better
lark
patted
the
heaving
shoulders
in
a
motherly
way
and
when
fairy
lifted
her
face
again
it
was
all
serene
though
her
lashes
were
wet
she
is
conscious
said
fairy
still
on
her
knees
but
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
smiling
she
regained
consciousness
a
little
while
ago
there
is
nothing
really
serious
the
matter
it
was
a
hard
knock
but
it
missed
the
temple
when
she
became
conscious
she
looked
up
at
father
and
smiled
father
looked
perfectly
awful
twins
so
pale
and
his
lips
were
trembling
and
prudence
said
father
on
your
word
of
honor
did
you
knock
me
down
with
that
ball
on
purpose
she
spoke
very
low
and
weak
but
just
like
prudence
father
could
say
a
word
he
just
nodded
and
gulped
she
has
a
little
fever
and
the
doctors
say
we
may
need
to
work
with
her
part
of
the
night
father
said
to
ask
if
you
would
go
to
bed
now
so
you
can
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
help
us
i
am
to
stay
with
prudence
but
you
may
have
to
take
turns
in
the
morning
and
you
have
to
get
breakfast
too
so
father
thinks
you
would
better
go
to
bed
will
you
do
that
twinnies
will
we
and
carol
added
will
you
kiss
prudence
good
night
for
us
and
tell
her
we
kept
praying
all
the
time
prudence
is
such
a
great
hand
for
praying
you
know
fairy
promised
and
the
twins
crept
it
was
dark
in
their
room
we
undress
in
the
dark
so
as
not
to
awake
poor
little
connie
whispered
lark
it
nice
she
can
sleep
like
that
is
it
and
the
twins
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
after
a
while
never
doubting
that
connie
in
her
corner
of
the
room
was
already
safe
and
happy
in
the
oblivion
of
slumber
but
poor
connie
she
had
not
wakened
when
fairy
closed
the
dungeon
door
it
was
long
afterward
when
she
sat
up
and
began
rubbing
her
eyes
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
then
she
remembered
she
wondered
if
prudence
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
trotted
over
to
the
dungeon
door
it
was
locked
she
could
not
turn
the
knob
at
first
she
thought
of
screaming
and
pounding
on
the
door
but
that
will
arouse
prudence
and
frighten
her
and
maybe
kill
her
she
thought
wretchedly
i
just
keep
still
until
some
one
passes
but
no
one
passed
for
a
long
time
and
connie
stretched
her
aching
little
body
and
sobbed
worrying
about
prudence
fearful
on
her
own
account
she
had
no
idea
of
the
time
she
supposed
it
was
still
early
and
the
parsonage
was
deathly
quiet
maybe
prudence
had
died
connie
writhed
in
agony
on
the
hard
floor
and
sobbed
bitterly
still
she
would
not
risk
pounding
on
the
dungeon
door
in
the
front
room
prudence
was
at
that
time
wrestling
with
fever
higher
and
higher
it
rose
until
the
doctors
looked
very
anxious
they
held
a
brief
consultation
in
the
corner
of
the
room
then
they
beckoned
to
starr
has
prudence
been
worrying
about
something
this
winter
yes
has
she
been
grieving
and
fretting
for
something
yes
she
has
it
is
that
young
man
is
it
inquired
the
family
doctor
a
methodist
member
yes
can
you
bring
him
here
yes
as
soon
as
he
can
get
here
from
des
moines
you
better
do
it
she
has
worn
herself
down
nearly
to
the
point
of
prostration
we
think
we
can
break
this
fever
without
serious
consequences
but
get
the
young
man
as
soon
as
possible
she
can
not
relax
and
rest
until
she
gets
relief
so
he
went
and
over
the
telephone
dictated
a
short
message
to
jerry
please
come
prudence
when
he
entered
the
front
bedroom
again
prudence
was
muttering
unintelligible
words
under
her
breath
he
kneeled
down
beside
the
bed
and
put
his
arms
around
her
she
clung
to
him
with
sudden
passion
jerry
jerry
she
cried
her
father
caressed
and
petted
her
but
did
not
speak
oh
i
ca
she
cried
again
i
ca
jerry
i
ca
again
her
voice
fell
to
low
mumbling
yes
go
go
at
once
i
promised
you
they
have
any
i
promised
jerry
jerry
her
voice
rang
out
so
wildly
that
connie
down
in
the
dungeon
heard
her
cries
and
sobbed
anew
relieved
that
prudence
was
living
frightened
at
the
wildness
of
her
voice
oh
i
do
want
you
more
than
anybody
do
go
oh
yes
go
at
once
i
father
needs
me
and
then
a
piercing
shriek
he
is
falling
connie
drop
that
rope
she
struggled
up
in
the
bed
and
gazed
wildly
about
her
then
panting
she
fell
back
on
the
pillows
but
starr
smiled
gently
to
himself
so
that
was
the
answer
oh
foolish
little
prudence
oh
little
martyr
girl
hours
later
the
fever
broke
and
prudence
drifted
into
a
deep
sleep
then
the
doctors
went
downstairs
with
starr
talking
in
quiet
ordinary
tones
oh
she
is
all
right
now
no
danger
at
all
she
do
fine
let
her
sleep
send
fairy
to
bed
too
keep
prudence
quiet
a
few
days
that
all
she
all
right
they
did
not
hear
the
timid
knock
at
the
dungeon
door
but
after
they
had
gone
out
starr
locked
the
door
behind
them
and
started
back
through
the
hall
to
see
if
the
kitchen
doors
were
locked
he
distinctly
heard
a
soft
tapping
and
he
smiled
mice
he
thought
then
he
heard
something
else
a
faintly
whispered
father
with
a
sharp
exclamation
he
unlocked
and
opened
the
dungeon
door
and
connie
fell
into
his
arms
sobbing
piteously
and
he
did
the
only
wise
thing
to
do
under
such
circumstances
he
sat
down
on
the
hall
floor
and
cuddled
the
child
against
his
breast
he
talked
to
her
soothingly
until
the
sobs
quieted
and
her
voice
was
under
control
now
tell
father
he
urged
how
did
you
get
in
the
dungeon
the
twins
oh
no
father
of
course
not
the
twins
would
do
such
a
thing
as
that
i
went
into
the
dungeon
to
pray
that
prudence
would
get
well
and
i
prayed
myself
to
sleep
when
i
woke
up
the
door
was
locked
but
you
precious
child
he
whispered
why
did
you
call
out
or
pound
on
the
door
i
was
afraid
it
would
excite
prue
and
make
her
worse
she
answered
simply
and
her
father
kiss
was
unwontedly
tender
as
he
carried
her
upstairs
to
bed
prudence
slept
late
the
next
morning
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
her
father
was
sitting
beside
her
all
right
this
morning
father
she
said
smiling
are
the
girls
at
school
no
this
is
saturday
oh
of
course
well
bring
them
up
i
want
to
see
them
just
then
the
distant
whistle
of
a
locomotive
sounded
through
the
open
window
but
she
did
not
notice
her
father
sudden
start
she
nodded
up
at
him
again
and
repeated
i
want
to
see
my
girls
her
father
sent
them
up
to
her
at
once
and
they
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
sorry
faces
and
smiled
at
her
say
something
whispered
carol
kicking
lark
suggestively
on
the
foot
but
lark
was
dumb
it
was
carol
who
broke
the
silence
oh
prudence
do
you
suppose
the
doctors
will
let
me
come
in
and
watch
them
bandage
your
head
i
want
to
begin
practising
up
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
next
war
then
they
laughed
and
the
girls
realized
that
prudence
was
really
alive
and
quite
as
always
they
told
her
of
connie
sad
experience
and
prudence
comforted
her
sweetly
it
just
proves
all
over
again
she
declared
smiling
but
with
a
sigh
close
following
that
you
ca
get
along
without
me
to
look
after
you
would
i
ever
go
to
bed
without
making
sure
that
connie
was
safe
and
sound
meanwhile
starr
was
plotting
with
fairy
a
willing
assistant
he
surely
be
in
on
this
train
and
you
must
keep
him
down
here
until
i
get
through
with
prudence
i
want
to
tell
her
a
few
things
before
she
sees
him
bring
him
in
quietly
and
do
let
him
speak
loudly
i
do
not
want
her
to
know
he
is
on
hand
for
a
few
minutes
explain
it
to
the
girls
will
you
after
sending
the
younger
girls
again
he
closed
the
door
of
prudence
room
and
sat
down
beside
her
prudence
i
ca
tell
you
how
bitterly
disappointed
i
am
in
you
father
yes
i
thought
you
loved
us
the
girls
and
me
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
considered
us
a
bunch
of
selfish
heartless
ungrateful
animals
father
is
that
your
idea
of
love
is
that
oh
father
it
really
did
hurt
me
prudence
my
dear
little
girl
how
could
you
send
jerry
away
breaking
your
heart
and
his
and
ours
too
just
because
you
thought
us
such
a
selfish
lot
that
we
would
begrudge
you
any
happiness
of
your
own
do
you
think
our
love
for
you
is
big
enough
to
make
us
happy
in
seeing
you
happy
you
used
to
say
you
would
never
marry
we
did
not
expect
you
to
marry
then
but
we
knew
the
time
would
come
when
marriage
would
seem
beautiful
and
desirable
to
you
we
were
waiting
for
that
time
we
were
hoping
for
it
we
were
happy
when
you
loved
jerry
because
we
knew
he
was
good
and
kind
and
loving
and
that
he
could
give
you
all
the
beautiful
things
of
life
that
i
can
never
give
my
children
but
you
thought
we
were
too
selfish
to
let
you
go
and
you
sent
him
away
but
father
who
would
raise
the
girls
who
would
keep
the
parsonage
who
would
look
after
you
aunt
grace
to
be
sure
we
talked
it
over
two
years
ago
when
her
husband
died
before
that
she
was
not
free
to
come
to
us
but
she
said
then
that
whenever
we
were
ready
for
her
she
would
come
we
both
felt
that
since
you
were
getting
along
so
magnificently
with
the
girls
it
was
better
that
way
for
a
while
but
she
said
that
when
your
came
she
would
come
to
us
gladly
we
had
it
all
arranged
you
wo
want
to
marry
for
a
year
or
so
yet
you
want
to
have
some
happy
sweetheart
days
first
and
you
want
to
make
a
lot
of
those
pretty
useless
nonsensical
things
other
girls
make
when
they
marry
that
why
i
advised
you
to
save
your
burglar
money
so
you
would
have
it
for
this
we
have
aunt
grace
come
right
away
so
you
can
take
a
little
freedom
to
be
happy
and
to
make
your
plans
and
you
can
initiate
aunt
grace
into
the
mysteries
of
parsonage
housekeeping
a
bright
strange
light
had
flashed
over
prudence
face
but
her
eyes
clouded
a
little
as
she
asked
do
you
think
they
would
rather
have
aunt
grace
than
me
of
course
not
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
we
love
you
so
dearly
that
we
can
only
be
happy
when
you
are
happy
we
love
you
so
dearly
that
we
can
be
happy
with
you
away
from
us
just
knowing
that
you
are
happy
but
you
you
thought
our
love
was
such
a
hideous
selfish
little
that
oh
father
i
did
you
know
i
did
but
maybe
jerry
forgive
me
now
why
did
you
talk
it
over
with
me
prudence
i
knew
you
too
well
father
i
knew
it
would
be
useless
but
does
it
seem
wrong
father
that
a
girl
that
i
should
love
jerry
more
than
you
and
the
girls
that
he
should
come
first
does
it
seem
wicked
no
prudence
it
is
not
wicked
after
all
perhaps
it
is
not
a
stronger
and
deeper
love
you
were
willing
to
sacrifice
him
and
yourself
for
our
sakes
but
it
is
a
different
love
it
is
the
love
of
woman
for
man
that
is
very
different
from
and
and
it
is
right
and
it
is
beautiful
i
am
sure
jerry
will
forgive
me
maybe
if
you
will
send
me
a
paper
and
pencil
i
can
write
him
a
note
now
there
no
use
waiting
is
there
fairy
will
bring
it
i
am
sure
but
when
a
few
minutes
later
she
heard
a
step
in
the
hall
outside
she
laid
her
arm
across
her
face
somehow
she
felt
that
the
wonderful
joy
and
love
shining
in
her
eyes
should
be
kept
hidden
until
jerry
was
there
to
see
she
heard
the
door
open
and
close
again
put
them
on
the
table
fairy
dearest
and
leave
me
for
a
little
while
will
you
thank
you
and
her
face
was
still
hidden
then
the
table
by
the
bedside
was
swiftly
drawn
away
and
jerry
kneeled
beside
her
and
drew
the
arm
from
her
face
jerry
she
whispered
half
unbelievingly
then
joyously
oh
jerry
she
gazed
anxiously
into
his
face
have
you
been
sick
how
thin
you
are
and
so
pale
jerry
harmer
you
need
me
to
take
care
of
you
do
you
but
jerry
did
not
speak
he
looked
earnestly
and
steadily
into
the
joyful
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
he
pressed
his
face
to
hers
