funny
little
tongue

out
and

was
gone

folks

i

in

polite
manner
the
adventures
of
old
toad
i
jimmy
skunk
is
puzzled
old
mother
west
wind
had
just
come
down
from
the
purple
hills
and
turned
loose
her
children
the
merry
little
breezes
from
the
big
bag
in
which
she
had
been
carrying
them
they
were
very
lively
and
very
merry
as
they
danced
and
raced
across
the
green
meadows
in
all
directions
for
it
was
good
to
be
back
there
once
more
old
mother
west
wind
almost
sighed
as
she
watched
them
for
a
few
minutes
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
join
them
always
the
springtime
made
her
feel
this
way
young
mad
carefree
and
happy
but
she
had
work
to
do
she
had
to
turn
the
windmill
to
pump
water
for
farmer
brown
cows
and
this
was
only
one
of
many
mills
standing
idle
as
they
waited
for
her
so
she
puffed
her
cheeks
out
and
started
about
her
business
jimmy
skunk
sat
at
the
top
of
the
hill
that
overlooks
the
green
meadows
and
watched
her
out
of
sight
then
he
started
to
amble
down
the
lone
little
path
to
look
for
some
beetles
he
was
ambling
along
in
his
lazy
way
for
you
know
he
never
hurries
when
he
heard
some
one
puffing
and
blowing
behind
him
of
course
he
turned
to
see
who
it
was
and
he
was
greatly
surprised
when
he
discovered
old
toad
yes
sir
it
was
old
toad
and
he
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
he
was
quite
short
of
breath
but
he
was
hopping
along
in
the
most
determined
way
as
if
he
were
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
somewhere
now
it
is
a
very
unusual
thing
for
toad
to
hurry
very
unusual
indeed
as
a
rule
he
hops
a
few
steps
and
then
sits
down
to
think
it
over
jimmy
had
never
before
seen
him
hop
more
than
a
few
steps
unless
he
was
trying
to
get
away
from
danger
from
blacksnake
for
instance
of
course
the
first
thing
jimmy
thought
of
was
blacksnake
and
he
looked
for
him
but
there
was
no
sign
of
blacksnake
nor
of
any
other
danger
then
he
looked
very
hard
at
old
toad
and
he
saw
right
away
that
old
toad
did
seem
to
be
frightened
at
all
only
very
determined
and
as
if
he
had
something
important
on
his
mind
well
well
exclaimed
jimmy
skunk
whatever
has
got
into
those
long
hind
legs
of
yours
to
make
them
work
so
fast
old
toad
did
say
a
word
but
simply
tried
to
get
past
jimmy
and
keep
on
his
way
jimmy
put
out
one
hand
and
turned
old
toad
right
over
on
his
back
where
he
kicked
and
struggled
in
an
effort
to
get
on
his
feet
again
and
looked
very
ridiculous
do
you
know
that
it
is
polite
not
to
speak
when
you
are
spoken
to
demanded
jimmy
severely
though
his
eyes
twinkled
i
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
have
any
breath
to
spare
panted
old
toad
you
see
i
in
a
great
hurry
yes
i
see
replied
jimmy
but
do
you
know
that
it
is
good
for
the
health
to
hurry
so
now
pray
what
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
for
i
see
anything
to
run
away
from
i
not
running
away
retorted
old
toad
indignantly
i
business
to
attend
to
at
the
smiling
pool
and
i
late
as
it
is
business
exclaimed
jimmy
as
if
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
what
business
have
you
at
the
smiling
pool
that
is
my
own
affair
retorted
old
toad
but
if
you
really
want
to
know
i
tell
you
i
have
a
very
important
part
in
the
spring
chorus
and
i
going
down
there
to
sing
i
have
a
very
beautiful
voice
that
was
too
much
for
jimmy
skunk
he
just
lay
down
and
rolled
over
and
over
with
laughter
the
idea
of
any
one
so
homely
almost
as
toad
thinking
that
he
had
a
beautiful
voice
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
roared
jimmy
when
at
last
he
stopped
because
he
could
laugh
any
more
he
discovered
that
old
toad
was
on
his
way
again
hop
hop
hop
hop
went
toad
jimmy
watched
him
and
he
confessed
that
he
was
puzzled
ii
jimmy
skunk
consults
his
friends
jimmy
skunk
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
as
he
watched
old
toad
go
down
the
lone
little
path
hop
hop
towards
the
smiling
pool
he
certainly
was
puzzled
was
jimmy
skunk
if
old
toad
had
told
him
that
he
could
fly
jimmy
would
not
have
been
more
surprised
or
found
it
harder
to
believe
than
that
old
toad
had
a
beautiful
voice
the
truth
is
jimmy
did
believe
it
he
thought
that
old
toad
was
trying
to
fool
him
presently
peter
rabbit
came
along
he
found
jimmy
skunk
sitting
in
a
brown
study
he
had
quite
forgotten
to
look
for
fat
beetles
and
when
he
forgets
to
do
that
you
may
make
up
your
mind
that
jimmy
is
doing
some
hard
thinking
hello
old
what
have
you
got
on
your
mind
this
fine
morning
cried
peter
rabbit
him
said
jimmy
simply
pointing
down
the
lone
little
path
peter
looked
do
you
mean
old
mr
toad
he
asked
jimmy
nodded
do
you
see
anything
queer
about
him
he
asked
in
his
turn
illustration
do
you
see
anything
queer
about
him
he
asked
peter
stared
down
the
lone
little
path
no
he
replied
except
that
he
seems
in
a
great
hurry
that
just
it
jimmy
returned
promptly
did
you
ever
see
him
hurry
unless
he
was
frightened
peter
confessed
that
he
never
had
well
he
is
frightened
now
yet
just
look
at
him
go
retorted
jimmy
says
he
has
got
a
beautiful
voice
and
that
he
has
to
take
part
in
the
spring
chorus
at
the
smiling
pool
and
that
he
is
late
peter
looked
very
hard
at
jimmy
to
see
if
he
was
fooling
or
telling
the
truth
then
he
began
to
laugh
old
toad
sing
the
very
idea
he
cried
he
can
sing
about
as
much
as
i
can
and
that
is
not
at
all
jimmy
grinned
i
think
he
crazy
if
you
ask
me
said
he
and
yet
he
was
just
as
earnest
about
it
as
if
it
were
really
so
i
think
he
must
have
eaten
something
that
has
gone
to
his
head
there
unc
billy
possum
over
there
let
ask
him
what
he
thinks
so
jimmy
and
peter
joined
unc
billy
and
jimmy
told
the
story
about
old
toad
all
over
again
unc
billy
chuckled
and
laughed
just
as
they
had
at
the
idea
of
old
toad
saying
he
had
a
beautiful
voice
but
billy
has
a
shrewd
little
head
on
his
shoulders
after
a
few
minutes
he
stopped
laughing
ah
done
learn
a
right
smart
long
time
ago
that
ah
don
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
mah
neighbors
said
he
done
think
of
brer
toad
as
fo
so
long
that
may
have
overlooked
something
ah
reckon
brer
toad
can
sing
but
ah
that
perhaps
he
thinks
he
can
what
do
say
to
going
down
to
the
smiling
pool
and
finding
out
what
he
really
is
up
to
the
very
thing
cried
peter
kicking
up
his
heels
you
know
peter
is
always
ready
to
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
that
will
satisfy
his
curiosity
jimmy
skunk
thought
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
decided
that
as
he
had
anything
in
particular
to
do
and
as
he
might
find
some
fat
beetles
on
the
way
he
would
go
too
so
off
they
started
after
old
toad
peter
rabbit
in
the
lead
as
usual
unc
billy
possum
next
grinning
as
only
he
can
grin
and
in
the
rear
jimmy
skunk
taking
his
time
and
keeping
a
sharp
eye
out
for
fat
beetles
iii
the
hunt
for
old
toad
now
though
old
toad
was
hurrying
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
and
was
quite
out
of
breath
he
was
getting
along
very
fast
compared
with
the
way
peter
rabbit
or
jimmy
skunk
or
unc
billy
possum
could
cover
the
ground
you
see
he
can
not
make
long
jumps
like
his
cousin
grandfather
frog
but
only
little
short
hops
so
peter
and
jimmy
and
unc
billy
took
their
time
about
following
him
they
stopped
to
hunt
for
fat
beetles
for
jimmy
skunk
and
at
every
little
patch
of
sweet
clover
for
peter
rabbit
to
help
himself
once
they
wasted
a
lot
of
time
while
unc
billy
possum
hunted
for
a
nest
of
carol
the
meadow
lark
on
the
chance
that
he
would
find
some
fresh
eggs
there
he
did
find
the
nest
for
the
very
good
reason
that
carol
had
built
one
yet
peter
was
secretly
glad
you
know
he
does
eat
eggs
and
he
is
always
sorry
for
his
feathered
friends
when
their
eggs
are
stolen
half
way
across
the
green
meadows
they
stopped
to
play
with
the
merry
little
breezes
and
because
it
was
very
pleasant
there
they
played
longer
than
they
realized
when
at
last
they
started
on
again
old
toad
was
out
of
sight
you
see
all
the
time
he
had
kept
right
on
going
hop
hop
never
mind
said
peter
we
can
catch
up
with
him
easy
enough
he
such
a
but
even
a
who
keeps
right
on
doing
a
thing
without
wasting
any
time
always
gets
somewhere
sooner
or
later
very
often
sooner
than
those
who
are
naturally
quicker
but
who
waste
their
time
so
it
was
with
old
toad
he
kept
right
on
hop
hop
while
the
others
were
playing
and
so
it
happened
that
when
at
last
peter
and
jimmy
and
billy
reached
the
smiling
pool
they
had
caught
another
glimpse
of
old
toad
do
you
suppose
he
hid
somewhere
and
we
passed
him
asked
peter
unc
billy
shook
his
head
ah
don
reckon
so
said
he
done
been
foolin
away
our
time
an
brer
toad
done
stole
a
march
on
us
ah
reckons
will
find
him
sittin
on
the
bank
here
somewhere
so
right
away
the
three
separated
to
look
for
old
toad
all
along
the
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
they
looked
they
peeped
under
old
leaves
and
sticks
they
looked
in
every
place
where
old
toad
might
have
hidden
but
not
a
trace
of
him
did
they
find
happy
am
i
as
i
can
be
sang
redwing
as
he
swayed
to
and
fro
among
the
bulrushes
say
redwing
have
you
seen
old
mr
toad
called
peter
rabbit
no
replied
redwing
is
that
whom
you
fellows
are
looking
for
i
wondered
if
you
had
lost
something
what
do
you
want
with
old
mr
toad
peter
explained
how
they
had
followed
old
toad
just
to
see
what
he
really
was
up
to
of
course
we
know
that
he
has
any
more
voice
than
i
have
declared
peter
but
we
are
curious
to
know
if
he
really
thinks
he
has
and
why
he
should
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
reach
the
smiling
pool
it
looks
to
us
as
if
the
spring
has
made
old
toad
crazy
oh
that
it
is
it
replied
redwing
his
bright
eyes
twinkling
some
people
do
know
as
much
as
they
might
i
been
wondering
where
old
toad
was
and
i
ever
so
glad
to
learn
that
he
has
forgotten
that
he
has
a
very
important
part
in
our
beautiful
spring
chorus
then
once
more
redwing
began
to
sing
iv
peter
rabbit
finds
old
toad
it
is
often
that
peter
rabbit
is
truly
envious
but
sometimes
in
the
joyousness
of
spring
he
is
he
envies
the
birds
because
they
can
pour
out
in
beautiful
song
the
joy
that
is
in
them
the
only
way
he
can
express
his
feelings
is
by
kicking
his
long
heels
jumping
about
and
such
foolish
things
while
that
gives
peter
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
it
does
add
to
the
joy
of
other
people
as
do
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
you
know
to
give
joy
to
others
is
to
add
to
your
own
joy
so
there
are
times
when
peter
wishes
he
could
sing
he
was
wishing
this
very
thing
now
as
he
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
listening
to
the
great
spring
chorus
there
joy
in
the
spring
for
you
and
for
me
sang
redwing
the
blackbird
from
the
bulrushes
from
over
in
the
green
meadows
rose
the
clear
lilt
of
carol
the
meadow
lark
and
among
the
alders
just
where
the
laughing
brook
ran
into
the
smiling
pool
a
flood
of
happiness
was
pouring
from
the
throat
of
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
winsome
bluebird
sweet
almost
plaintive
whistle
seemed
to
fairly
float
in
the
air
so
that
it
was
hard
to
say
just
where
it
did
come
from
and
in
the
top
of
the
big
welcome
robin
was
singing
as
if
his
heart
were
bursting
with
joy
even
sammy
jay
was
adding
a
beautiful
note
instead
of
his
usual
harsh
scream
as
for
the
smiling
pool
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
water
itself
sang
for
a
mighty
chorus
of
clear
piping
voices
from
unseen
singers
rose
from
all
around
its
banks
peter
knew
who
those
singers
were
although
look
as
he
would
he
could
see
none
of
them
they
were
hylas
the
tiny
cousins
of
stickytoes
the
tree
toad
listening
to
all
these
joyous
voices
peter
forgot
for
a
time
what
had
brought
him
to
the
smiling
pool
but
jimmy
skunk
and
unc
billy
possum
did
forget
they
were
still
hunting
for
old
toad
well
old
dreamer
have
you
found
him
yet
asked
jimmy
skunk
stealing
up
behind
peter
and
poking
him
in
the
back
peter
came
to
himself
with
a
start
no
said
he
i
was
just
listening
and
wishing
that
i
could
sing
too
do
you
ever
wish
you
could
sing
jimmy
no
replied
jimmy
i
never
waste
time
wishing
i
could
do
things
it
was
never
meant
i
should
do
it
funny
where
old
toad
is
he
said
that
he
was
coming
down
here
to
sing
and
redwing
the
blackbird
seemed
to
be
expecting
him
i
looked
everywhere
i
can
think
of
without
finding
him
but
i
do
believe
in
giving
up
without
another
try
stop
your
dreaming
and
come
help
us
hunt
so
peter
stopped
his
dreaming
and
joined
in
the
search
now
there
was
one
place
where
neither
peter
nor
jimmy
nor
unc
billy
had
thought
of
looking
that
was
in
the
smiling
pool
itself
they
just
took
it
for
granted
that
old
toad
was
somewhere
on
the
bank
presently
peter
came
to
a
place
where
the
bank
was
very
low
and
the
water
was
shallow
for
quite
a
little
distance
out
in
the
smiling
pool
from
out
of
that
shallow
water
came
the
piping
voice
of
a
hyla
and
peter
stopped
to
stare
trying
to
see
the
tiny
singer
suddenly
he
jumped
right
up
in
the
air
with
surprise
there
was
a
head
sticking
out
of
the
water
peter
had
found
old
toad
v
old
toad
music
bag
never
think
that
you
have
learned
all
there
is
to
know
that
the
surest
way
of
all
ignorance
to
show
i
found
old
mr
toad
cried
peter
rabbit
hurrying
after
jimmy
skunk
where
demanded
jimmy
in
the
water
declared
peter
he
sitting
right
over
there
where
the
water
is
shallow
and
he
did
notice
me
at
all
let
get
unc
billy
and
then
creep
over
to
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
and
watch
to
see
if
old
toad
really
does
try
to
sing
so
they
hunted
up
unc
billy
possum
and
the
three
stole
very
softly
over
to
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
where
the
bank
was
low
and
the
water
shallow
sure
enough
there
sat
old
toad
with
just
his
head
out
of
water
and
while
they
were
watching
him
something
very
strange
happened
what
what
the
matter
with
him
whispered
peter
his
big
eyes
looking
as
if
they
might
pop
out
of
his
head
if
he
do
watch
out
he
blow
up
and
bust
exclaimed
jimmy
illustration
if
he
do
watch
out
he
blow
up
and
bust
exclaimed
jimmy
listen
whispered
unc
billy
possum
do
mah
ol
ears
hear
right
to
me
that
that
song
is
coming
right
from
where
brer
toad
is
sitting
it
certainly
did
appear
so
and
of
all
the
songs
that
glad
spring
day
there
was
none
sweeter
indeed
there
were
few
as
sweet
the
only
trouble
was
the
song
was
so
very
short
it
lasted
only
for
two
or
three
seconds
and
when
it
ended
old
toad
looked
quite
his
natural
self
again
just
as
commonplace
almost
ugly
as
ever
peter
looked
at
jimmy
skunk
jimmy
looked
at
unc
billy
possum
and
unc
billy
looked
at
peter
and
no
one
had
a
word
to
say
then
all
three
looked
back
at
old
toad
and
even
as
they
looked
his
throat
began
to
swell
and
swell
and
swell
until
it
was
no
wonder
that
jimmy
skunk
had
thought
that
he
was
in
danger
of
blowing
up
and
then
when
it
stopped
swelling
there
came
again
those
beautiful
little
notes
so
sweet
and
tremulous
that
peter
actually
held
his
breath
to
listen
there
was
no
doubt
that
old
toad
was
singing
just
as
he
had
said
he
was
going
to
and
it
was
just
as
true
that
his
song
was
one
of
the
sweetest
if
not
sweetest
of
all
the
chorus
from
and
around
the
smiling
pool
it
was
very
hard
to
believe
but
peter
and
jimmy
and
billy
both
saw
and
heard
and
that
was
enough
their
respect
for
old
toad
grew
tremendously
as
they
listened
how
does
he
do
it
whispered
peter
with
that
bag
under
his
chin
of
course
replied
jimmy
skunk
do
you
see
it
only
when
that
is
swelled
out
that
he
sings
it
a
regular
music
bag
and
i
did
know
he
had
any
such
bag
there
at
all
i
wish
said
peter
rabbit
feeling
of
his
throat
that
i
had
a
music
bag
like
that
in
my
throat
and
then
he
joined
in
the
laugh
of
jimmy
and
unc
billy
but
still
with
something
of
a
look
of
wistfulness
in
his
eyes
vi
peter
discovers
something
more
there
are
stranger
things
in
the
world
than
ever
you
dreamed
could
be
there
beauty
in
some
of
the
commonest
things
if
only
you
eyes
to
see
ever
since
peter
rabbit
was
a
little
chap
and
had
first
ran
away
from
home
he
had
known
old
toad
and
never
once
had
peter
suspected
that
he
could
sing
also
he
had
thought
old
toad
almost
and
he
knew
that
most
of
his
neighbors
thought
the
same
way
they
were
fond
of
old
toad
for
he
was
always
and
attended
strictly
to
his
own
affairs
but
they
liked
to
poke
fun
at
him
and
as
for
there
being
anything
beautiful
about
him
such
a
thing
never
entered
their
heads
now
that
they
had
discovered
that
he
really
has
a
very
beautiful
voice
they
began
to
look
on
him
with
a
great
deal
more
respect
this
was
especially
so
with
peter
he
got
in
the
habit
of
going
over
to
the
smiling
pool
every
day
when
the
way
was
clear
just
to
sit
on
the
bank
and
listen
to
old
toad
why
did
you
ever
tell
us
before
that
you
could
sing
he
asked
one
day
as
old
toad
looked
up
at
him
from
the
smiling
pool
what
was
the
use
of
wasting
my
breath
demanded
old
toad
you
would
have
believed
me
if
i
had
you
did
believe
me
when
i
did
tell
you
peter
knew
that
this
was
true
and
he
could
find
any
answer
ready
at
last
he
ventured
another
question
why
have
i
ever
heard
you
sing
before
you
have
replied
old
toad
tartly
i
sang
right
in
this
very
place
last
spring
and
the
spring
before
and
the
spring
before
that
you
sat
on
that
very
bank
lots
of
times
while
i
was
singing
the
trouble
with
you
peter
is
that
you
do
use
your
eyes
or
your
ears
peter
looked
more
foolish
than
ever
but
he
ventured
another
question
it
would
be
peter
to
let
a
chance
for
questions
go
by
have
i
ever
heard
you
singing
up
on
the
meadows
or
in
the
old
orchard
no
replied
old
toad
i
only
sing
in
the
springtime
that
the
time
for
singing
i
just
to
sing
then
in
the
summer
it
is
too
hot
and
in
the
winter
i
sleep
i
always
return
to
my
old
home
to
sing
you
know
i
was
born
here
all
my
family
gathers
here
in
the
spring
to
sing
so
of
course
i
come
too
old
toad
filled
out
his
queer
music
bag
under
his
chin
and
began
to
sing
again
peter
watched
him
now
it
just
happened
that
old
toad
was
facing
him
and
so
peter
looked
down
straight
into
his
eyes
he
never
had
looked
into
toad
eyes
before
and
now
he
just
stared
and
stared
for
it
came
over
him
that
those
eyes
were
very
beautiful
very
beautiful
indeed
oh
he
exclaimed
what
beautiful
eyes
you
have
mr
toad
so
i
been
told
before
replied
old
toad
my
family
always
has
had
beautiful
eyes
there
is
an
old
saying
that
every
toad
has
jewels
in
his
head
but
of
course
he
has
not
real
jewels
it
is
just
the
beautiful
eyes
excuse
me
peter
but
i
needed
in
that
chorus
old
toad
once
more
swelled
out
his
throat
and
began
to
sing
peter
watched
him
a
while
longer
then
hopped
away
to
the
dear
old
briarpatch
and
he
was
very
thoughtful
never
again
will
i
call
anybody
homely
and
ugly
until
i
know
all
about
him
said
peter
which
was
a
very
wise
decision
do
you
think
so
vii
a
shadow
passes
over
the
smiling
pool
here
what
toad
says
heed
it
well
my
dear
time
to
watch
for
clouds
is
when
the
sky
is
clear
he
says
that
that
is
the
reason
that
he
lives
to
a
good
old
age
does
old
toad
i
suppose
he
means
that
when
the
sky
is
cloudy
everybody
is
looking
for
rain
and
is
prepared
for
it
but
when
the
sun
is
shining
most
people
forget
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
storm
so
when
it
comes
suddenly
very
few
are
prepared
for
it
it
is
the
same
way
with
danger
and
trouble
so
old
toad
very
wisely
watches
out
when
there
seems
to
be
the
least
need
of
it
and
he
finds
it
always
pays
it
was
a
beautiful
spring
evening
over
back
of
the
purple
hills
to
which
old
mother
west
wind
had
taken
her
children
the
merry
little
breezes
and
behind
which
jolly
round
red
sun
had
gone
to
bed
there
was
still
a
faint
clear
light
but
over
the
green
meadows
and
the
smiling
pool
the
shadows
had
drawn
a
curtain
of
soft
dusk
which
in
the
green
forest
became
black
the
little
stars
looked
down
from
the
sky
and
twinkled
just
to
see
their
reflections
twinkle
back
at
them
from
the
smiling
pool
and
there
and
all
around
it
was
perfect
peace
jerry
muskrat
swam
back
and
forth
making
little
silver
lines
on
the
surface
of
the
smiling
pool
and
squeaking
contentedly
for
it
was
the
hour
which
he
loves
best
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
had
tucked
his
head
under
his
wing
and
gone
to
sleep
among
the
alders
along
the
laughing
brook
and
redwing
the
blackbird
had
done
the
same
thing
among
the
bulrushes
all
the
feathered
songsters
who
had
made
joyous
the
bright
day
had
gone
to
bed
but
this
did
not
mean
that
the
glad
spring
chorus
was
silent
oh
my
no
no
indeed
the
green
meadows
were
silent
and
the
green
forest
was
silent
but
as
if
to
make
up
for
this
the
sweet
singers
of
the
smiling
pool
the
hylas
and
the
frogs
and
old
toad
were
pouring
out
their
gladness
as
if
they
had
not
been
singing
most
of
the
departed
day
you
see
it
was
the
hour
they
love
best
of
all
the
hour
which
seems
to
them
just
made
for
singing
and
they
were
doing
their
best
to
tell
old
mother
nature
how
they
love
her
and
how
glad
they
were
that
she
had
brought
back
sweet
mistress
spring
to
waken
them
from
their
long
sleep
it
was
so
peaceful
and
beautiful
there
that
it
did
seem
possible
that
danger
of
any
kind
could
be
lurking
near
but
old
toad
swelling
out
that
queer
music
bag
in
his
throat
and
singing
with
all
his
might
never
once
forgot
that
wise
saying
of
his
and
so
he
was
the
first
to
see
what
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
little
detached
bit
of
the
blackness
of
the
green
forest
floating
out
towards
the
smiling
pool
instantly
he
stopped
singing
now
that
was
a
signal
when
he
stopped
singing
his
nearest
neighbor
stopped
singing
then
the
next
one
and
the
next
and
in
a
minute
there
was
a
sound
from
the
smiling
pool
save
the
squeak
of
jerry
muskrat
hidden
among
the
bulrushes
that
great
chorus
stopped
as
abruptly
as
the
electric
lights
go
out
when
you
press
a
button
back
and
forth
over
the
smiling
pool
this
way
and
that
way
floated
the
shadow
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
living
thing
in
the
smiling
pool
after
awhile
the
shadow
floated
away
over
the
green
meadows
without
a
sound
hooty
the
owl
did
get
one
of
us
that
time
said
old
toad
to
his
nearest
neighbor
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
then
he
swelled
out
his
music
bag
and
began
to
sing
again
and
at
once
as
abruptly
as
it
had
stopped
the
great
chorus
began
again
as
joyous
as
before
for
nothing
had
happened
to
bring
sadness
as
might
have
but
for
the
watchfulness
of
old
toad
viii
old
toad
babies
the
smiling
pool
a
nursery
where
all
the
sunny
day
a
thousand
funny
babies
are
taught
while
at
their
play
really
the
smiling
pool
is
a
sort
of
kindergarten
one
of
the
most
interesting
kindergartens
in
the
world
little
joe
otter
children
learn
to
swim
there
so
do
jerry
muskrat
babies
and
those
of
billy
mink
the
trout
and
minnow
babies
and
a
lot
more
and
there
you
will
find
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
grandfather
frog
and
old
toad
peter
rabbit
had
known
for
a
long
time
about
the
frog
babies
but
though
he
knew
that
old
toad
was
own
cousin
to
grandfather
frog
he
had
known
anything
about
toad
babies
except
that
at
a
certain
time
in
the
year
he
was
forever
running
across
tiny
toads
especially
on
rainy
days
and
each
little
toad
was
just
like
old
toad
except
for
his
size
peter
had
heard
it
said
that
toads
rain
down
from
the
sky
and
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
this
must
be
so
of
course
he
knew
it
could
be
but
it
puzzled
him
a
great
deal
there
would
be
a
toad
in
sight
then
it
would
begin
to
rain
and
right
away
there
would
be
so
many
tiny
toads
that
it
was
hard
work
to
jump
without
stepping
on
some
he
remembered
this
as
he
went
to
pay
his
daily
call
on
old
toad
in
the
smiling
pool
and
listen
to
his
sweet
song
he
had
seen
any
little
toads
this
year
but
he
remembered
his
experiences
with
them
in
other
years
and
he
meant
to
ask
about
them
old
toad
was
sitting
in
his
usual
place
but
he
was
singing
he
was
staring
at
something
in
the
water
when
peter
said
good
morning
old
toad
did
seem
to
hear
him
he
was
too
much
interested
in
what
he
was
watching
peter
stared
down
into
the
water
to
see
what
was
interesting
old
toad
so
much
but
he
saw
nothing
but
a
lot
of
wriggling
tadpoles
what
are
you
staring
at
so
mr
sobersides
asked
peter
speaking
a
little
louder
than
before
old
toad
turned
and
looked
at
peter
and
there
was
a
look
of
great
pride
in
his
face
i
just
watching
my
babies
are
they
lovely
said
he
peter
stared
harder
than
ever
but
he
could
see
anything
that
looked
like
a
baby
toad
where
are
they
asked
he
i
do
see
any
babies
but
those
of
grandfather
frog
and
if
you
ask
me
i
always
did
think
tadpoles
about
the
homeliest
things
in
th
world
old
toad
grew
indignant
those
are
not
grandfather
frog
children
they
mine
he
sputtered
and
i
have
you
know
that
they
are
the
most
beautiful
babies
in
th
world
peter
drew
a
hand
across
his
mouth
to
hide
a
smile
i
beg
your
pardon
toad
said
he
i
i
thought
all
tadpoles
were
frog
babies
they
all
look
alike
to
me
well
they
not
declared
old
toad
how
any
one
can
mistake
my
babies
for
their
cousins
i
can
not
understand
now
mine
are
beautiful
while
interrupted
the
great
deep
voice
of
grandfather
frog
what
are
you
talking
about
why
your
babies
are
no
more
to
be
compared
with
my
babies
for
real
beauty
than
nothing
at
all
i
leave
it
to
peter
if
they
are
but
peter
wisely
held
his
tongue
to
tell
the
truth
he
could
see
beauty
in
any
of
them
to
him
they
were
all
just
wriggling
pollywogs
they
were
more
interesting
now
because
he
had
found
out
that
some
of
them
were
toads
and
some
were
frogs
and
he
had
known
before
that
baby
toads
begin
life
as
tadpoles
but
he
had
no
intention
of
being
drawn
into
the
dispute
now
waxing
furious
between
grandfather
frog
and
old
toad
ix
the
smiling
pool
kindergarten
play
a
little
learn
a
little
grow
a
little
too
that
what
every
pollywoggy
tries
his
best
to
do
of
course
that
what
a
kindergarten
is
for
and
you
may
be
sure
that
the
babies
of
grandfather
frog
and
old
toad
and
stickytoes
the
tree
toad
did
all
of
these
things
in
the
kindergarten
of
the
smiling
pool
they
looked
considerably
alike
did
these
little
cousins
for
they
were
all
pollywogs
to
begin
with
peter
rabbit
came
over
every
day
to
watch
them
always
he
had
thought
pollywogs
just
homely
wriggling
things
not
the
least
bit
interesting
but
since
he
had
discovered
how
proud
of
them
were
grandfather
frog
and
old
toad
he
had
begun
to
wonder
about
them
and
then
to
watch
them
there
one
thing
about
them
and
that
is
they
are
not
in
danger
the
way
any
babies
are
said
peter
talking
to
himself
as
is
his
way
when
there
is
no
one
else
to
talk
to
just
then
a
funny
little
black
pollywog
wriggled
into
sight
and
while
peter
was
watching
him
a
suddenly
rushed
from
among
the
water
grass
seized
the
pollywog
by
his
tail
and
dragged
him
down
peter
stared
could
it
be
that
that
bug
was
as
dangerous
an
enemy
to
the
baby
toad
as
reddy
fox
is
to
a
baby
rabbit
he
began
to
suspect
so
and
a
little
later
he
knew
so
for
there
was
that
same
little
pollywog
trying
hard
to
swim
and
making
bad
work
of
it
because
he
had
lost
half
of
his
long
tail
that
set
peter
to
watching
sharper
than
ever
and
presently
he
discovered
that
pollywogs
have
to
keep
their
eyes
open
quite
as
much
as
do
baby
rabbits
if
they
would
live
to
grow
up
there
were
several
kinds
of
queer
bugs
forever
darting
out
at
the
wriggling
pollywogs
fish
lay
in
wait
for
them
and
longlegs
the
blue
heron
seemed
to
have
a
special
liking
for
them
but
the
pollywogs
were
spry
and
seemed
to
have
learned
to
watch
out
they
seemed
to
peter
to
spend
all
their
time
swimming
and
eating
and
growing
they
grew
so
fast
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
almost
them
grow
and
just
imagine
how
surprised
peter
was
to
discover
one
day
that
that
very
pollywog
which
he
had
seen
lose
his
tail
had
grown
a
one
that
puzzled
peter
more
than
anything
he
had
seen
in
a
long
time
why
i
could
do
that
he
exclaimed
right
out
loud
do
what
demanded
jerry
muskrat
who
happened
along
just
then
why
grow
a
new
tail
like
that
pollywog
replied
peter
and
told
jerry
all
that
he
had
seen
jerry
laughed
you
see
queerer
things
than
that
if
you
watch
those
pollywogs
long
enough
said
he
they
are
a
queer
lot
of
babies
and
very
interesting
to
watch
if
you
got
the
time
for
it
i
have
this
smiling
pool
is
a
great
kindergarten
and
there
something
happening
here
every
minute
there
no
place
like
it
are
those
great
big
fat
pollywogs
grandfather
frog
children
or
old
mr
toad
asked
peter
grandfather
frog
last
year
children
replied
jerry
they
grow
into
real
frogs
this
summer
if
nothing
happens
to
them
where
are
old
toad
last
year
children
asked
peter
do
ask
me
replied
jerry
they
hopped
away
last
summer
never
saw
anything
like
the
way
those
toad
youngsters
grow
those
toad
pollywogs
you
see
now
will
turn
into
real
toads
and
be
leaving
the
smiling
pool
in
a
few
weeks
people
think
old
toad
is
slow
but
there
is
nothing
slow
about
his
children
look
at
that
little
fellow
over
there
he
begun
to
grow
legs
already
peter
looked
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
pollywog
with
a
pair
of
legs
sprouting
out
they
were
his
fore
legs
and
they
certainly
did
make
him
look
funny
and
only
a
few
days
before
there
had
been
a
sign
of
legs
my
gracious
exclaimed
peter
what
a
funny
sight
i
thought
my
babies
grew
fast
but
these
beat
them
x
the
little
toads
start
out
to
see
the
world
the
world
is
a
wonderful
great
big
place
and
in
it
the
young
must
roam
to
learn
what
their
elders
have
long
since
learned
there
never
a
place
like
home
it
had
been
some
time
since
peter
rabbit
had
visited
the
smiling
pool
to
watch
the
pollywogs
but
one
cloudy
morning
he
happened
to
think
of
them
and
decided
that
he
would
run
over
there
and
see
how
they
were
getting
along
so
off
he
started
he
wondered
if
those
pollywog
children
of
old
toad
would
be
much
changed
the
last
time
he
saw
them
some
of
them
had
just
begun
to
grow
legs
although
they
still
had
long
tails
he
had
almost
reached
the
smiling
pool
when
great
big
drops
of
rain
began
to
splash
down
and
with
those
first
raindrops
something
funny
happened
anyway
it
seemed
funny
to
peter
right
away
he
was
surrounded
by
tiny
little
toads
everywhere
he
looked
he
saw
toads
tiny
little
toads
just
like
old
toad
only
so
tiny
that
one
could
have
sat
comfortably
on
a
piece
and
still
had
plenty
of
room
peter
big
eyes
grew
round
with
surprise
as
he
stared
where
had
they
all
come
from
so
suddenly
a
minute
before
he
had
seen
a
single
one
and
now
he
could
hardly
move
without
stepping
on
one
it
seemed
it
really
seemed
as
if
each
raindrop
turned
into
a
tiny
toad
the
instant
it
struck
the
ground
of
course
peter
knew
that
that
could
be
but
it
was
very
puzzling
and
all
those
little
toads
were
bravely
hopping
along
as
if
they
were
bound
for
some
particular
place
peter
watched
them
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
once
more
started
for
the
smiling
pool
on
the
very
bank
whom
should
he
meet
but
old
toad
he
looked
rather
thin
and
his
back
was
to
the
smiling
pool
yes
sir
he
was
hopping
away
from
the
smiling
pool
where
he
had
been
all
the
spring
singing
in
the
great
chorus
peter
was
almost
as
surprised
to
see
him
as
he
had
been
to
see
the
little
toads
but
just
then
he
was
most
interested
in
those
little
toads
good
morning
old
toad
said
peter
in
his
most
polite
manner
can
you
tell
me
where
all
these
little
toads
came
from
illustration
can
you
tell
me
where
all
these
little
toads
came
from
certainly
replied
old
toad
they
came
from
the
smiling
pool
of
course
where
did
you
suppose
they
came
from
i
i
did
know
there
was
one
to
be
seen
and
then
it
began
to
rain
and
right
away
they
were
everywhere
it
it
almost
seemed
as
if
they
had
rained
down
out
of
the
sky
old
toad
chuckled
they
got
good
sense
if
i
must
say
it
about
my
own
children
said
he
they
know
that
wet
weather
is
the
only
weather
for
toads
to
travel
in
they
left
the
smiling
pool
in
the
night
while
it
was
damp
and
comfortable
and
then
when
the
sun
came
up
they
hid
like
sensible
children
under
anything
they
could
find
sticks
stones
pieces
of
bark
grass
the
minute
this
shower
came
up
they
knew
it
was
good
traveling
weather
and
out
they
popped
but
what
did
they
leave
the
smiling
pool
for
peter
asked
to
see
the
great
world
replied
old
toad
foolish
very
foolish
of
them
but
they
would
do
it
i
did
the
same
thing
myself
when
i
was
their
age
could
stop
me
any
more
than
i
could
stop
them
they
do
know
when
they
well
off
but
young
folks
never
do
fine
weather
is
it
xi
old
toad
queer
tongue
old
mother
nature
doth
provide
for
all
her
children
large
or
small
her
wisdom
foresees
all
their
needs
and
makes
provision
for
them
all
if
you
do
believe
it
just
you
go
ask
old
toad
as
peter
rabbit
did
how
such
a
fellow
as
he
is
can
catch
enough
bugs
and
insects
to
keep
him
alive
perhaps
you
learn
something
just
as
peter
did
peter
and
old
toad
sat
in
the
rain
watching
the
tiny
toads
who
you
know
were
toad
children
leaving
their
kindergarten
in
the
smiling
pool
and
starting
out
to
see
the
great
world
when
the
last
little
toad
had
passed
them
old
toad
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
hungry
very
hungry
indeed
did
have
time
to
eat
much
while
i
was
in
the
smiling
pool
he
explained
could
eat
and
sing
too
and
while
i
was
down
there
i
was
supposed
to
sing
now
that
it
is
time
to
quit
singing
i
begin
to
realize
that
i
got
a
stomach
to
look
out
for
as
well
as
a
voice
see
that
bug
over
there
on
that
leaf
watch
him
peter
looked
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
fat
bug
crawling
along
on
an
old
leaf
he
was
about
two
inches
from
old
toad
and
he
was
crawling
very
fast
and
right
while
peter
was
looking
at
him
he
disappeared
peter
turned
to
look
at
old
toad
he
had
budged
he
was
sitting
exactly
where
he
had
been
sitting
all
the
time
but
he
was
smacking
his
lips
and
there
was
a
twinkle
of
satisfaction
in
his
eyes
peter
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
wha
what
he
began
nice
bug
interrupted
old
toad
nicest
bug
i
eaten
for
a
longtime
but
i
did
see
you
catch
him
protested
peter
looking
at
old
toad
as
if
he
suspected
him
of
joking
anything
wrong
with
your
eyes
inquired
old
toad
no
replied
peter
just
a
wee
bit
crossly
my
eyes
are
just
as
good
as
ever
then
watch
me
catch
that
fly
over
yonder
said
old
toad
he
hopped
towards
a
fly
which
had
lighted
on
a
blade
of
grass
just
ahead
about
two
inches
from
it
he
stopped
and
so
far
as
peter
could
see
he
sat
perfectly
still
but
the
fly
disappeared
and
it
was
because
it
flew
away
either
peter
was
sure
of
that
as
he
told
peter
about
it
afterwards
it
was
there
and
then
it
was
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
old
toad
chuckled
did
you
see
that
one
go
peter
he
asked
peter
shook
his
head
i
wish
you
would
stop
fooling
me
said
peter
the
joke
is
on
me
but
now
you
had
your
laugh
at
my
expense
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
how
you
do
it
please
mr
toad
now
when
peter
said
please
that
way
of
course
old
toad
could
resist
him
nobody
could
here
comes
an
ant
this
way
now
you
watch
my
mouth
instead
of
the
ant
and
see
what
happens
said
old
toad
peter
looked
and
saw
a
big
black
ant
coming
then
he
kept
his
eyes
on
old
toad
mouth
suddenly
there
was
a
little
flash
of
red
from
it
so
tiny
and
so
quick
that
peter
could
be
absolutely
sure
that
he
saw
it
but
when
he
looked
for
the
ant
it
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
peter
looked
at
old
toad
very
hard
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
toad
that
you
got
a
tongue
long
enough
to
reach
way
over
to
where
that
ant
was
he
asked
old
toad
chuckled
again
with
every
insect
swallowed
he
felt
better
natured
you
guessed
it
peter
said
he
handy
tongue
is
it
i
think
it
a
very
queer
tongue
retorted
peter
and
i
do
understand
it
at
all
if
it
so
long
as
all
that
where
do
you
keep
it
when
it
in
use
i
should
think
you
have
to
swallow
it
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
or
else
leave
it
hanging
out
of
your
mouth
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
laughed
old
toad
my
tongue
never
is
in
the
way
and
it
the
handiest
tongue
in
the
world
i
show
it
to
you
xii
old
toad
shows
his
tongue
to
show
one
tongue
as
you
well
know
is
not
considered
nice
to
do
but
if
it
were
like
i
want
to
show
it
would
you
i
quite
sure
you
would
you
see
if
it
were
like
old
toad
it
would
be
such
a
wonderful
tongue
that
i
suspect
you
would
want
everybody
to
see
it
old
toad
thinks
his
tongue
the
most
satisfactory
tongue
in
the
world
in
fact
he
is
quite
sure
that
without
it
he
could
get
along
at
all
and
i
do
know
as
he
could
and
yet
very
few
of
his
neighbors
know
anything
about
that
tongue
and
how
different
it
is
from
most
other
tongues
peter
rabbit
did
until
old
toad
showed
him
after
peter
had
puzzled
and
puzzled
over
the
mysterious
way
in
which
bugs
and
flies
disappeared
whenever
they
happened
to
come
within
two
inches
or
less
of
old
toad
what
peter
could
understand
was
what
old
toad
did
with
a
tongue
that
would
reach
two
inches
beyond
his
mouth
he
said
as
much
i
show
you
my
tongue
and
then
you
wish
you
had
one
just
like
it
said
old
toad
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
he
opened
his
big
mouth
and
slowly
ran
his
tongue
out
its
full
length
why
exclaimed
peter
it
fastened
at
the
wrong
end
no
such
thing
replied
old
toad
indignantly
if
it
was
fastened
at
the
other
end
how
could
i
run
it
out
so
far
but
mine
and
all
other
tongues
that
i
ever
have
seen
are
fastened
way
down
in
the
throat
protested
peter
yours
is
fastened
at
the
other
end
way
in
the
very
front
of
your
mouth
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
there
are
a
great
many
things
you
have
never
heard
of
peter
rabbit
replied
old
toad
drily
mine
is
the
right
way
to
have
a
tongue
because
it
is
fastened
way
up
in
the
front
of
my
mouth
that
way
i
can
use
the
whole
of
it
you
see
it
goes
out
its
full
length
then
when
i
draw
it
in
with
a
bug
on
the
end
of
it
i
just
turn
it
over
so
that
the
end
that
was
out
goes
way
back
in
my
throat
and
takes
the
bug
with
it
to
just
the
right
place
to
swallow
peter
thought
this
over
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
ventured
another
question
i
begin
to
understand
said
he
but
how
do
you
hold
on
to
the
bug
with
your
tongue
my
tongue
is
sticky
of
course
stupid
replied
old
toad
looking
very
much
disgusted
just
let
me
touch
a
bug
with
it
and
he
mine
every
time
peter
thought
this
over
then
he
felt
of
his
own
tongue
mine
sticky
said
he
very
innocently
old
toad
laughed
right
out
perhaps
if
it
was
you
could
ask
so
many
questions
said
he
now
watch
me
catch
that
fly
his
funny
little
tongue
darted
out
and
the
fly
was
gone
illustration
his
funny
little
tongue
darted
out
and
the
fly
was
gone
it
certainly
is
very
handy
said
peter
politely
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
more
rain
and
i
better
be
getting
back
to
the
dear
old
briarpatch
very
much
obliged
to
you
toad
i
think
you
are
very
wonderful
not
at
all
replied
old
toad
i
simply
got
the
things
i
need
in
order
to
live
just
as
you
have
the
things
you
need
i
could
get
along
with
your
kind
of
a
tongue
but
no
more
could
you
get
along
with
mine
if
you
live
long
enough
you
will
learn
that
old
mother
nature
makes
no
mistakes
she
gives
each
of
us
what
we
need
and
each
one
has
different
needs
xiii
peter
rabbit
is
impolite
peter
rabbit
could
get
old
toad
off
his
mind
he
had
discovered
so
many
interesting
things
about
old
toad
that
he
was
almost
on
the
point
of
believing
him
to
be
the
most
interesting
of
all
his
neighbors
and
his
respect
for
old
toad
had
become
very
great
indeed
of
course
who
would
respect
any
one
with
such
beautiful
eyes
and
such
a
sweet
voice
and
such
a
wonderful
tongue
yet
at
the
same
time
peter
felt
very
foolish
whenever
he
remembered
that
all
his
life
he
had
been
acquainted
with
old
toad
without
really
knowing
him
at
all
there
was
one
comforting
thought
and
that
was
that
most
of
his
neighbors
were
just
as
ignorant
regarding
old
toad
as
peter
had
been
funny
mused
peter
how
we
can
live
right
beside
people
all
our
lives
and
not
really
know
them
at
all
i
suppose
that
is
why
we
should
never
judge
people
hastily
i
believe
i
will
go
hunt
up
old
toad
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
anything
more
off
started
peter
he
did
know
just
where
to
go
now
that
old
toad
had
left
the
smiling
pool
but
he
had
an
idea
that
he
would
not
be
far
from
their
meeting
place
of
the
day
before
when
old
toad
had
explained
about
his
wonderful
tongue
but
when
he
got
there
peter
found
no
trace
of
old
toad
you
see
it
had
rained
the
day
before
and
that
is
just
the
kind
of
weather
that
a
toad
likes
best
for
traveling
peter
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
but
he
did
he
hunted
for
awhile
and
finally
gave
it
up
and
started
up
the
crooked
little
path
with
the
idea
of
running
over
for
a
call
on
johnny
chuck
in
the
old
orchard
jolly
round
bright
sun
was
shining
his
brightest
and
peter
soon
forgot
all
about
old
toad
he
scampered
along
up
the
crooked
little
path
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
but
how
good
it
was
to
be
alive
and
occasionally
kicking
up
his
heels
for
pure
joy
he
had
just
done
this
when
his
ears
caught
the
sound
of
a
queer
noise
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
crooked
little
path
instantly
peter
stopped
and
sat
up
to
listen
there
it
was
again
and
it
seemed
to
come
from
under
an
old
piece
of
board
it
was
just
a
little
rustling
sound
hardly
to
be
heard
there
some
one
under
that
old
board
thought
peter
and
peeped
under
all
he
could
see
was
that
there
was
something
moving
instantly
peter
was
all
curiosity
whoever
was
there
was
not
very
big
he
was
sure
of
that
of
course
that
meant
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
so
what
do
you
think
peter
did
why
he
just
pulled
that
old
board
over
and
when
he
did
that
he
saw
whom
do
you
think
why
old
toad
to
be
sure
but
such
a
sight
as
old
toad
was
peter
just
stared
for
a
full
minute
he
could
find
his
voice
old
toad
was
changing
his
clothes
yes
sir
that
is
just
what
old
toad
was
doing
he
was
taking
off
his
old
suit
and
under
it
was
a
brand
new
one
but
such
a
time
as
he
was
having
he
was
opening
and
shutting
his
big
mouth
and
drawing
his
hind
legs
under
him
and
rubbing
them
against
his
body
then
peter
saw
a
strange
thing
he
saw
that
old
toad
old
suit
had
split
in
several
places
and
he
was
getting
it
off
by
sucking
it
into
his
mouth
in
a
few
minutes
his
hind
legs
were
free
of
the
old
suit
and
little
by
little
it
began
to
be
pulled
free
from
his
body
all
the
time
old
toad
was
working
very
hard
to
suck
it
at
the
corners
of
his
big
mouth
he
glared
angrily
at
peter
but
he
could
say
anything
because
his
mouth
was
too
full
he
looked
so
funny
that
peter
just
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
rolled
over
and
over
with
laughter
this
made
old
toad
glare
more
angrily
than
ever
but
he
could
say
anything
not
a
word
when
he
had
got
his
hands
free
by
pulling
the
sleeves
of
his
old
coat
off
inside
out
he
used
his
hands
to
pull
the
last
of
it
over
his
head
then
he
gulped
very
hard
two
or
three
times
to
swallow
his
old
suit
and
when
the
last
of
it
had
disappeared
he
found
his
voice
do
you
know
that
it
is
the
most
impolite
thing
in
the
world
to
look
at
people
when
they
are
changing
their
clothes
he
sputtered
xiv
old
toad
disappears
admit
your
fault
when
you
done
wrong
and
do
postpone
it
over
long
peter
rabbit
did
blame
old
toad
a
bit
for
being
indignant
because
peter
had
watched
him
change
his
suit
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
do
old
toad
had
looked
very
funny
while
he
was
struggling
out
of
his
old
suit
and
peter
just
could
help
laughing
at
him
but
he
realized
that
he
had
been
very
impolite
and
he
very
meekly
told
old
toad
so
you
see
it
was
this
way
explained
peter
i
heard
something
under
that
old
board
and
i
just
naturally
turned
it
over
to
find
out
what
was
there
hump
grunted
old
toad
i
did
have
the
least
idea
that
you
were
there
continued
peter
when
i
found
who
it
was
and
what
you
were
doing
i
could
help
watching
because
it
was
so
interesting
and
i
could
help
laughing
because
you
really
did
look
so
funny
but
i
sorry
toad
truly
i
am
i
mean
to
be
so
impolite
i
promise
never
to
do
it
again
i
do
suppose
toad
that
it
seems
at
all
wonderful
to
you
that
you
can
change
your
suit
that
way
but
it
does
to
me
i
had
heard
that
you
swallowed
your
old
suits
but
i
never
half
believed
it
now
i
know
it
is
so
and
just
how
you
do
it
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
learned
something
worth
knowing
do
you
know
i
think
you
are
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
wonderful
of
all
my
neighbors
and
i
never
laugh
at
or
tease
you
again
mr
toad
hump
grunted
old
toad
again
but
it
was
very
clear
that
he
was
a
little
flattered
by
peter
interest
in
him
and
was
rapidly
recovering
his
good
nature
there
is
one
thing
i
do
understand
yet
said
peter
and
that
is
where
you
go
to
to
sleep
all
winter
do
you
go
down
into
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
smiling
pool
the
way
grandfather
frog
does
certainly
not
retorted
old
toad
use
your
common
sense
peter
rabbit
if
i
had
spent
the
winter
in
the
smiling
pool
do
you
suppose
i
would
have
left
it
to
come
way
up
here
and
then
have
turned
right
around
and
gone
back
there
to
sing
i
not
so
fond
of
long
journeys
as
all
that
that
so
peter
looked
foolish
i
did
think
of
that
when
i
spoke
the
trouble
with
you
and
with
a
lot
of
other
people
is
that
you
speak
first
and
do
your
thinking
afterward
when
you
do
any
thinking
at
all
grunted
old
toad
now
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
disappear
right
here
you
mean
that
you
would
hide
under
that
old
board
just
as
you
did
before
said
peter
with
a
very
wise
look
nothing
of
the
sort
snapped
old
toad
i
could
disappear
and
not
go
near
that
old
board
not
a
step
nearer
than
i
am
now
peter
looked
in
all
directions
carefully
but
not
a
thing
could
he
see
under
which
old
toad
could
possibly
hide
except
the
old
board
and
he
had
said
he
would
hide
under
that
i
do
like
to
doubt
your
word
toad
said
he
but
you
have
to
show
me
before
i
can
believe
that
old
toad
eyes
twinkled
here
was
a
chance
to
get
even
with
peter
for
watching
him
change
his
suit
if
you
turn
your
back
to
me
and
look
straight
down
the
crooked
little
path
for
five
minutes
i
disappear
said
he
more
than
that
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
will
not
hop
three
feet
from
where
i
am
sitting
all
right
replied
peter
promptly
turning
his
back
to
old
toad
i
look
down
the
crooked
little
path
for
five
minutes
and
promise
not
to
peek
so
peter
sat
and
gazed
straight
down
the
crooked
little
path
it
was
a
great
temptation
to
roll
his
eyes
back
and
peep
behind
him
but
he
had
given
his
word
that
he
would
and
he
did
when
he
thought
the
five
minutes
were
up
he
turned
around
old
toad
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
peter
looked
hastily
this
way
and
that
way
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
old
toad
he
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
he
never
had
been
there
xv
old
toad
gives
peter
a
scare
if
you
play
pranks
on
other
folks
you
may
be
sure
that
they
will
take
the
first
chance
that
they
get
a
joke
on
you
to
play
old
toad
was
getting
even
with
peter
for
laughing
at
him
while
back
had
been
turned
old
toad
had
disappeared
it
was
too
much
for
peter
look
as
he
would
he
could
see
so
much
as
a
chip
under
which
old
toad
might
have
hidden
excepting
the
old
board
and
old
toad
had
given
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
hide
under
that
nevertheless
peter
hopped
over
to
it
and
turned
it
over
again
because
he
could
think
of
any
other
place
to
look
of
course
old
toad
was
there
of
course
not
he
had
given
his
word
that
he
hide
there
and
he
always
lives
up
to
his
word
peter
should
have
known
better
than
to
have
looked
there
old
toad
had
also
said
that
he
would
not
go
three
feet
from
the
spot
where
he
was
sitting
at
the
time
so
peter
should
have
known
better
than
to
have
raced
up
the
crooked
little
path
as
he
did
but
if
old
toad
had
nothing
to
hide
under
of
course
he
must
have
hopped
away
reasoned
peter
he
could
hop
far
in
five
minutes
that
was
sure
and
so
peter
ran
this
way
and
that
way
a
great
deal
farther
than
it
would
have
been
possible
for
old
toad
to
have
gone
but
it
was
a
wholly
useless
search
and
presently
peter
returned
and
sat
down
on
the
very
spot
where
he
had
last
seen
old
toad
peter
never
had
felt
more
foolish
in
all
his
life
he
began
to
think
that
old
toad
must
be
bewitched
and
had
some
strange
power
of
making
himself
invisible
for
a
long
time
peter
sat
perfectly
still
trying
to
puzzle
out
how
old
toad
had
disappeared
but
the
more
he
puzzled
over
it
the
more
impossible
it
seemed
and
yet
old
toad
had
disappeared
suddenly
peter
gave
a
frightened
scream
and
jumped
higher
than
he
ever
had
jumped
before
in
all
his
life
a
voice
the
voice
of
old
toad
himself
had
said
well
now
are
you
satisfied
that
voice
had
come
from
right
under
peter
do
you
wonder
that
he
was
frightened
when
he
turned
to
look
there
sat
old
toad
right
where
he
himself
had
been
sitting
a
moment
before
peter
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
very
foolishly
did
you
come
from
he
stammered
at
last
old
toad
grinned
i
show
you
said
he
and
right
while
peter
was
looking
at
him
he
began
to
sink
down
into
the
ground
until
only
the
top
of
his
head
could
be
seen
then
that
disappeared
old
toad
had
gone
down
and
the
sand
had
fallen
right
back
over
him
peter
just
had
to
rub
his
eyes
again
he
had
to
then
to
make
sure
he
began
to
dig
away
the
sand
where
old
toad
had
been
sitting
in
a
minute
he
felt
old
toad
who
at
once
came
out
again
old
toad
beautiful
eyes
twinkled
more
than
ever
i
guess
we
are
even
now
peter
said
he
peter
nodded
more
than
that
toad
i
think
you
have
a
little
the
best
of
it
he
replied
now
wo
you
tell
me
how
you
did
it
old
toad
held
up
one
of
his
stout
hind
feet
and
on
it
was
a
kind
of
spur
there
another
just
like
that
on
the
other
foot
said
he
and
i
use
them
to
dig
with
you
go
into
a
hole
headfirst
but
i
go
in
the
other
way
i
make
my
hole
in
soft
earth
and
back
into
it
at
the
same
time
this
way
he
began
to
work
his
stout
hind
feet
and
as
he
kicked
the
earth
out
he
backed
in
at
the
same
time
when
he
was
deep
enough
the
earth
just
fell
back
over
him
for
you
see
it
was
very
loose
and
not
packed
down
at
all
when
he
once
more
reappeared
peter
thanked
him
then
he
asked
one
more
question
is
that
the
way
you
go
into
winter
quarters
old
toad
nodded
and
it
the
way
i
escape
from
my
enemies
xvi
jimmy
skunk
is
surprised
jimmy
skunk
ambled
along
the
crooked
little
path
down
the
hill
he
hurry
because
jimmy
does
believe
in
hurrying
the
only
time
he
ever
hurries
is
when
he
sees
a
fat
beetle
trying
to
get
out
of
sight
then
jimmy
hurry
but
just
now
he
did
see
any
fat
beetles
although
he
was
looking
for
them
so
he
just
ambled
along
as
if
he
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
as
indeed
he
had
he
was
feeling
very
was
jimmy
skunk
and
why
should
he
there
was
everything
to
make
him
feel
summer
had
arrived
to
stay
on
every
side
he
heard
glad
voices
bumble
the
bee
was
humming
a
song
best
of
all
jimmy
had
found
three
beetles
that
very
morning
and
he
knew
that
there
were
more
if
he
could
find
them
so
why
should
he
feel
good
jimmy
had
laughed
at
peter
rabbit
for
being
so
anxious
for
summer
to
arrive
but
he
was
just
as
glad
as
peter
that
she
had
come
although
he
would
have
said
so
for
the
world
his
sharp
little
eyes
twinkled
as
he
ambled
along
and
there
was
much
that
they
missed
as
he
walked
he
talked
quite
to
himself
of
course
because
there
was
nobody
near
to
hear
and
this
is
what
he
was
saying
beetle
beetle
smooth
and
smug
you
are
nothing
but
a
bug
bugs
were
made
for
skunks
to
eat
so
come
out
from
your
retreat
hello
there
a
nice
big
piece
of
bark
over
there
that
looks
as
if
it
ought
to
have
a
dozen
fat
beetles
under
it
it
great
fun
to
pull
over
pieces
of
bark
and
see
fat
beetles
run
all
ways
at
once
i
just
have
to
see
what
is
under
that
piece
jimmy
tiptoed
softly
over
to
the
big
piece
of
bark
and
then
as
he
made
ready
to
turn
it
over
he
began
again
that
foolish
little
verse
beetle
beetle
smooth
and
smug
you
are
nothing
but
a
bug
as
he
said
the
last
word
he
suddenly
pulled
the
piece
of
bark
over
who
a
bug
asked
a
funny
voice
and
it
sounded
rather
cross
jimmy
skunk
nearly
tumbled
over
backward
in
surprise
and
for
a
minute
he
could
find
his
tongue
there
instead
of
the
fat
beetles
he
had
been
so
sure
of
sat
old
toad
and
he
did
look
at
all
pleased
who
a
bug
he
repeated
instead
of
answering
jimmy
skunk
began
to
laugh
who
a
bug
demanded
old
toad
more
crossly
than
before
there
is
any
bug
toad
and
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
jimmy
remembering
his
politeness
i
just
thought
there
was
you
see
i
know
you
were
under
that
piece
of
bark
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
toad
have
you
seen
any
fat
beetles
this
morning
no
said
old
toad
grumpily
and
yawned
and
rubbed
his
eyes
why
exclaimed
jimmy
skunk
i
believe
you
have
just
waked
up
what
if
i
have
demanded
old
toad
oh
nothing
nothing
at
all
toad
replied
jimmy
skunk
only
you
are
the
second
one
i
met
this
morning
who
had
just
waked
up
who
was
the
other
asked
old
toad
blacksnake
replied
jimmy
he
inquired
for
you
old
toad
turned
quite
pale
i
i
think
i
be
moving
along
said
he
xvii
old
toad
mistake
if
is
a
very
little
word
to
look
at
but
the
biggest
word
you
have
ever
seen
does
begin
to
have
so
much
meaning
as
little
if
jimmy
skunk
had
ambled
down
the
crooked
little
path
just
when
he
did
he
been
looking
for
fat
beetles
he
had
seen
that
big
piece
of
bark
at
one
side
and
decided
to
pull
it
over
it
had
been
for
all
these
ifs
why
old
toad
would
have
made
the
mistake
he
did
and
you
would
have
had
this
story
but
jimmy
skunk
amble
down
the
crooked
little
path
he
look
for
beetles
and
he
pull
over
that
big
piece
of
bark
and
when
he
had
pulled
it
over
he
found
old
toad
there
old
toad
had
crept
under
that
piece
of
bark
because
he
wanted
to
take
a
nap
but
when
jimmy
skunk
told
him
that
he
had
seen
blacksnake
that
very
morning
and
that
blacksnake
had
asked
after
old
toad
the
very
last
bit
of
sleepiness
left
old
toad
yes
sir
he
was
wide
awake
right
away
you
see
he
knew
right
away
why
blacksnake
had
asked
after
him
he
knew
that
blacksnake
has
a
fondness
for
toads
he
turned
quite
pale
when
he
heard
that
blacksnake
had
asked
after
him
and
right
then
he
made
his
mistake
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
that
neighborhood
that
he
forgot
to
ask
jimmy
skunk
just
where
he
had
seen
blacksnake
he
hardly
waited
long
enough
to
say
to
jimmy
skunk
but
started
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
now
it
just
happened
that
old
toad
started
up
the
crooked
little
path
and
it
just
happened
that
blacksnake
was
coming
down
the
crooked
little
path
now
when
people
are
very
much
afraid
they
almost
always
seem
to
think
that
danger
is
behind
instead
of
in
front
of
them
it
was
so
with
old
toad
instead
of
watching
out
in
front
as
he
hopped
along
he
kept
watching
over
his
shoulder
and
that
was
his
second
mistake
he
was
so
sure
that
blacksnake
was
somewhere
behind
him
that
he
did
look
to
see
where
he
was
going
and
you
know
that
people
who
do
look
to
see
where
they
are
going
are
almost
sure
to
go
headfirst
right
into
trouble
old
toad
went
hopping
up
the
crooked
little
path
as
fast
as
he
could
which
was
very
fast
because
he
never
can
hop
very
fast
and
all
the
time
he
kept
looking
behind
for
blacksnake
presently
he
came
to
a
turn
in
the
crooked
little
path
and
as
he
hurried
around
it
he
almost
ran
into
blacksnake
himself
it
was
a
question
which
was
more
surprised
for
just
a
wee
second
they
stared
at
each
other
then
blacksnake
eyes
began
to
sparkle
good
morning
toad
is
this
a
beautiful
morning
i
was
just
thinking
about
you
said
he
but
poor
old
toad
did
say
good
morning
he
did
say
anything
he
could
because
he
was
too
scared
he
just
gave
a
frightened
little
squeal
turned
around
and
started
down
the
crooked
little
path
twice
as
fast
as
he
had
come
up
blacksnake
grinned
and
started
after
him
not
very
fast
because
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
run
very
fast
to
catch
old
toad
and
he
thought
the
exercise
would
do
him
good
and
this
is
how
it
happened
that
summer
morning
that
jolly
bright
sun
looking
down
from
the
blue
blue
sky
and
smiling
to
see
how
happy
everybody
seemed
suddenly
discovered
that
there
was
one
of
the
little
meadow
people
who
was
happy
but
instead
was
terribly
terribly
unhappy
it
was
old
toad
hopping
down
the
crooked
little
path
for
his
life
while
after
him
and
getting
nearer
and
nearer
glided
blacksnake
xviii
jimmy
skunk
is
just
in
time
jimmy
skunk
ambled
slowly
along
chuckling
as
he
thought
of
what
a
hurry
toad
had
been
in
when
he
had
heard
that
blacksnake
had
asked
after
him
it
had
been
funny
very
funny
indeed
to
see
toad
try
to
hurry
suddenly
jimmy
stopped
chuckling
then
he
stopped
ambling
along
the
crooked
little
path
he
turned
around
and
looked
back
and
as
he
did
so
he
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
he
had
just
happened
to
think
that
old
toad
had
gone
up
the
crooked
little
path
and
it
was
the
crooked
little
path
that
blacksnake
had
shown
himself
that
morning
if
he
still
up
there
thought
jimmy
old
toad
is
hopping
right
straight
into
the
very
worst
kind
of
trouble
how
stupid
of
him
not
to
have
asked
me
where
blacksnake
was
well
it
none
of
my
business
i
guess
i
go
on
but
he
had
gone
on
down
the
crooked
little
path
only
a
few
steps
when
he
stopped
again
you
see
jimmy
is
really
a
very
little
fellow
and
somehow
he
did
like
to
think
of
what
might
happen
to
old
toad
i
hate
to
go
way
back
there
he
grumbled
for
you
know
he
is
naturally
rather
lazy
still
the
green
meadows
would
be
quite
the
same
without
old
toad
i
should
miss
him
if
anything
happened
to
him
i
suppose
it
would
be
partly
my
fault
too
for
if
i
had
pulled
over
that
piece
of
bark
he
probably
would
have
stayed
there
the
rest
of
the
day
and
been
safe
maybe
he
wo
meet
blacksnake
said
a
little
voice
inside
of
jimmy
and
maybe
he
will
said
jimmy
right
out
loud
and
with
that
he
started
back
up
the
crooked
little
path
and
strange
to
say
jimmy
hurried
he
had
just
reached
a
turn
in
the
crooked
little
path
when
who
should
run
right
plump
into
him
but
poor
old
toad
he
gave
a
frightened
squeal
and
fell
right
over
on
his
back
and
kicked
foolishly
as
he
tried
to
get
on
his
feet
again
but
he
was
all
out
of
breath
and
so
frightened
and
tired
that
all
he
could
do
was
to
kick
and
kick
he
had
seen
jimmy
at
all
for
he
had
been
looking
behind
him
and
he
did
even
know
who
it
was
he
had
run
into
right
behind
him
came
blacksnake
of
course
he
saw
jimmy
and
he
stopped
short
and
hissed
angrily
what
were
you
going
to
do
to
mr
toad
demanded
jimmy
none
of
your
business
hissed
blacksnake
get
out
of
my
way
or
you
be
sorry
jimmy
skunk
just
laughed
and
stepped
in
front
of
poor
old
toad
blacksnake
coiled
himself
up
in
the
path
and
darted
his
tongue
out
at
jimmy
in
the
most
impudent
way
then
he
tried
to
make
himself
look
very
fierce
then
he
jumped
straight
at
jimmy
skunk
with
his
mouth
wide
open
but
he
took
great
care
not
to
jump
quite
far
enough
to
reach
jimmy
you
see
he
was
just
trying
to
scare
jimmy
but
jimmy
did
scare
he
knows
all
about
blacksnake
and
that
really
he
is
a
coward
so
he
suddenly
gritted
his
teeth
in
a
way
not
at
all
pleasant
to
hear
and
started
for
blacksnake
blacksnake
did
wait
no
sir
he
did
wait
he
suddenly
turned
and
glided
back
up
the
crooked
little
path
hissing
angrily
jimmy
followed
him
a
little
way
and
then
he
went
back
to
old
toad
oh
panted
toad
you
came
just
in
time
i
could
have
hopped
another
hop
i
guess
i
did
replied
jimmy
now
you
get
your
breath
and
come
along
with
me
and
old
toad
did
xix
old
toad
gets
his
stomach
full
pray
do
not
tip
your
nose
in
scorn
at
things
which
others
eat
for
things
to
you
not
good
at
all
to
others
are
most
sweet
there
are
ants
for
instance
you
would
want
to
eat
them
even
if
you
were
dreadfully
hungry
but
old
toad
and
buster
bear
think
there
is
nothing
much
nicer
now
buster
bear
had
found
old
toad
catching
ants
one
at
a
time
as
he
kept
watch
beside
their
home
and
it
had
pleased
buster
to
find
some
one
else
who
liked
ants
right
away
he
invited
old
toad
to
dine
with
him
but
poor
old
toad
was
frightened
almost
to
death
when
he
heard
the
deep
voice
of
buster
bear
for
he
had
been
so
busy
watching
the
ants
that
he
had
seen
buster
coming
he
fell
right
over
on
his
back
which
was
at
all
dignified
and
made
buster
bear
laugh
that
frightened
toad
more
than
ever
you
see
he
did
have
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
buster
bear
meant
to
eat
him
and
when
buster
invited
him
to
dinner
he
was
sure
that
that
was
just
a
joke
on
buster
part
but
there
was
no
way
to
escape
and
after
a
little
old
toad
thought
it
best
to
be
polite
because
you
know
it
always
pays
to
be
polite
so
he
said
in
a
very
faint
voice
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
dine
with
buster
then
he
waved
his
feet
feebly
trying
to
get
on
his
feet
again
buster
bear
laughed
harder
than
ever
it
was
a
low
deep
laugh
and
sent
cold
shivers
all
over
poor
old
toad
but
when
buster
reached
out
a
great
paw
with
great
claws
toad
quite
gave
up
he
did
have
strength
enough
left
to
even
kick
he
just
closed
his
eyes
and
waited
for
the
end
what
do
you
think
happened
why
he
was
rolled
over
on
to
his
feet
so
gently
that
he
just
gasped
with
surprise
it
did
seem
possible
that
such
a
great
paw
could
be
so
gentle
now
said
buster
bear
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
sound
pleasant
but
which
was
just
the
same
i
know
where
there
is
a
fine
dinner
waiting
for
us
just
a
little
way
from
here
you
follow
me
and
have
it
in
no
time
so
buster
bear
led
the
way
and
old
toad
followed
as
fast
as
he
could
because
he
did
dare
not
to
presently
buster
stopped
beside
a
big
decayed
old
log
if
you
are
ready
toad
we
will
dine
now
said
he
old
toad
did
see
anything
to
eat
his
heart
sank
again
and
he
shook
all
over
i
i
not
hungry
said
he
in
a
very
faint
voice
buster
bear
did
seem
to
hear
he
hooked
his
great
claws
into
the
old
log
and
gave
a
mighty
pull
over
rolled
the
log
and
there
were
ants
and
ants
and
ants
hurrying
this
way
and
scurrying
that
way
more
ants
than
toad
had
seen
in
all
his
life
before
help
yourself
said
buster
bear
politely
old
toad
did
wait
to
be
told
twice
he
forgot
all
about
his
fright
he
forgot
all
about
buster
bear
he
forgot
that
he
was
hungry
he
forgot
his
manners
he
jumped
right
in
among
those
ants
and
for
a
little
while
he
was
the
busiest
toad
ever
seen
buster
bear
was
busy
too
he
swept
his
long
tongue
this
way
and
he
swept
it
that
way
and
each
time
he
drew
it
back
into
his
mouth
it
was
covered
with
ants
at
last
old
toad
could
hold
another
ant
then
he
remembered
buster
bear
and
looked
up
a
little
fearfully
buster
was
smacking
his
lips
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
each
eye
good
are
they
said
he
the
best
i
ever
ate
declared
old
toad
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
come
dine
with
me
again
said
buster
bear
and
somehow
this
time
old
toad
did
mind
because
his
voice
sounded
thank
you
i
will
replied
old
toad
xx
old
toad
is
puffed
up
old
toad
hopped
slowly
down
the
lone
little
path
he
usually
does
hop
slowly
but
this
time
he
hopped
slower
than
ever
you
see
he
was
so
puffed
up
that
he
could
have
hopped
fast
if
he
had
wanted
to
and
he
want
to
in
the
first
place
his
stomach
was
so
full
of
ants
that
there
was
room
for
another
one
no
sir
old
toad
could
have
swallowed
another
ant
if
he
had
tried
of
course
they
made
his
stomach
stick
out
but
it
was
the
ants
that
puffed
him
out
all
over
oh
my
no
it
was
pride
that
what
it
was
pride
you
know
nothing
can
puff
any
one
up
quite
like
foolish
pride
old
toad
was
old
enough
to
have
known
better
it
is
bad
enough
to
see
young
and
foolish
creatures
puffed
up
with
pride
but
it
is
worse
to
see
any
one
as
old
as
old
toad
that
way
he
held
his
head
so
high
that
he
could
see
his
own
feet
and
more
than
once
he
stubbed
his
toes
presently
he
met
his
old
friend
danny
meadow
mouse
he
tipped
his
head
a
little
higher
puffed
himself
out
a
little
more
and
pretended
not
to
see
danny
hello
toad
said
danny
toad
pretended
not
to
hear
danny
looked
puzzled
then
he
spoke
again
and
this
time
he
shouted
hello
toad
i
have
seen
you
for
some
time
it
would
do
to
pretend
not
to
hear
this
time
oh
how
do
you
do
danny
said
old
toad
with
a
very
grand
air
and
pretending
to
be
much
surprised
sorry
i
ca
stop
but
i
been
dining
with
my
friend
buster
bear
and
now
i
must
get
home
when
he
mentioned
the
name
of
buster
bear
he
puffed
himself
out
a
little
more
danny
grinned
as
he
watched
him
hop
on
down
the
lone
little
path
talk
with
common
folks
any
more
he
muttered
i
heard
that
pride
is
very
apt
to
turn
people
heads
but
i
never
expected
to
see
old
toad
proud
illustration
ca
talk
with
common
folks
any
more
he
muttered
toad
kept
on
his
way
and
presently
he
met
peter
rabbit
peter
stopped
to
gossip
as
is
his
way
but
old
toad
took
no
notice
of
him
at
all
he
kept
right
on
with
his
head
high
and
all
puffed
out
peter
might
have
been
a
stick
or
a
stone
for
all
the
notice
old
toad
took
of
him
peter
looked
puzzled
then
he
hurried
down
to
tell
danny
meadow
mouse
about
it
oh
said
danny
he
been
to
dine
with
buster
bear
and
now
he
has
no
use
for
his
old
friends
pretty
soon
along
came
johnny
chuck
and
he
was
very
much
put
out
because
he
had
been
treated
by
old
toad
just
as
peter
rabbit
had
striped
chipmunk
told
the
same
story
so
did
unc
billy
possum
it
was
the
same
with
all
of
old
toad
old
friends
and
neighbors
excepting
bobby
coon
who
you
know
is
buster
bear
little
cousin
to
him
old
toad
was
very
polite
and
talked
a
great
deal
about
buster
bear
and
thought
that
bobby
must
be
very
proud
to
be
related
to
buster
at
first
everybody
thought
it
a
great
joke
to
see
old
toad
so
puffed
up
with
pride
but
after
a
little
they
grew
tired
of
being
snubbed
by
their
old
friend
and
neighbor
and
began
to
say
unpleasant
things
about
him
then
they
decided
that
what
old
toad
needed
was
a
lesson
so
they
put
their
heads
together
and
planned
how
they
would
teach
old
toad
how
foolish
it
is
for
any
one
to
be
puffed
up
with
pride
xxi
old
toad
receives
another
invitation
the
friends
and
neighbors
of
old
toad
decided
that
he
needed
to
be
taught
a
lesson
at
first
you
know
every
one
had
laughed
at
him
because
he
had
grown
too
proud
to
speak
to
them
but
after
a
little
they
grew
tired
of
being
treated
so
and
some
of
them
put
their
heads
together
to
think
of
some
plan
to
teach
old
toad
a
lesson
and
what
a
very
very
foolish
thing
false
pride
is
the
very
next
day
jimmy
skunk
went
into
the
green
forest
to
look
for
buster
bear
you
know
jimmy
is
afraid
of
buster
he
did
have
to
look
long
and
when
he
had
found
him
the
very
first
thing
he
did
was
to
ask
buster
if
he
had
seen
any
fat
beetles
that
morning
you
know
jimmy
is
very
fond
of
fat
beetles
and
the
first
thing
he
asks
any
one
he
may
happen
to
meet
is
if
they
have
seen
any
buster
bear
grinned
and
said
he
thought
he
knew
where
there
might
be
a
few
and
he
would
be
pleased
to
have
jimmy
go
with
him
to
see
sure
enough
under
an
old
log
he
found
five
fat
beetles
and
these
jimmy
gobbled
up
without
even
asking
buster
if
he
would
have
one
jimmy
is
usually
very
polite
but
this
time
he
quite
forgot
politeness
i
am
afraid
he
is
rather
apt
to
when
fat
beetles
are
concerned
but
buster
did
seem
to
mind
when
the
last
beetle
had
disappeared
jimmy
smacked
his
lips
and
then
he
told
buster
bear
what
he
had
come
for
of
course
at
first
buster
had
thought
it
was
for
the
fat
beetles
but
it
was
no
sir
it
was
for
the
fat
beetles
at
all
it
was
to
get
buster
bear
help
in
a
plan
to
teach
old
toad
a
lesson
first
jimmy
told
buster
all
about
how
puffed
up
old
toad
was
because
he
had
dined
with
buster
and
how
ever
since
then
he
had
refused
even
to
speak
to
his
old
friends
and
neighbors
it
tickled
buster
bear
so
to
think
that
little
homely
old
toad
could
be
proud
of
anything
that
he
laughed
and
laughed
and
his
laugh
was
deep
and
then
jimmy
told
him
the
plan
to
teach
old
toad
a
lesson
and
asked
buster
if
he
would
help
buster
eyes
twinkled
as
he
promised
to
do
what
jimmy
asked
then
jimmy
went
straight
to
where
old
toad
was
sitting
all
puffed
up
taking
a
buster
bear
has
just
sent
word
by
me
to
ask
if
you
will
honor
him
by
dining
with
him
at
the
rotted
chestnut
stump
near
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
said
jimmy
in
his
politest
manner
now
if
old
toad
was
puffed
up
before
just
think
how
he
swelled
out
when
he
heard
that
jimmy
skunk
was
actually
afraid
that
he
would
burst
you
may
tell
my
friend
buster
bear
that
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
honor
him
by
dining
with
him
replied
old
toad
with
a
very
grand
air
jimmy
went
off
to
deliver
his
reply
and
old
toad
sat
and
puffed
himself
out
until
he
could
hardly
breathe
honor
him
by
dining
with
him
said
he
over
and
over
to
himself
i
never
was
so
flattered
in
my
life
xxii
old
toad
learns
a
lesson
pride
is
like
a
great
big
bubble
you
find
there
nothing
in
it
prick
it
and
for
all
your
trouble
it
has
vanished
in
a
minute
old
toad
was
so
puffed
out
with
pride
as
he
started
for
the
green
forest
to
dine
with
buster
bear
that
those
who
saw
him
wondered
if
he
would
burst
before
he
got
there
everybody
knew
where
he
was
going
and
this
made
old
toad
feel
more
important
and
proud
than
ever
he
might
not
have
felt
quite
so
puffed
up
if
he
had
known
just
how
it
had
come
about
that
he
received
this
second
invitation
to
dine
with
buster
bear
when
jimmy
skunk
brought
it
to
him
jimmy
did
tell
him
that
buster
had
been
asked
to
send
the
invitation
and
that
it
was
all
part
of
a
plan
on
the
part
of
some
of
old
toad
old
friends
and
neighbors
to
teach
him
a
lesson
no
indeed
jimmy
did
say
anything
at
all
about
that
so
old
toad
went
hopping
along
and
stumbling
over
his
own
feet
because
his
head
was
held
so
high
and
he
was
so
puffed
out
that
he
could
see
where
he
was
going
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
important
buster
bear
must
consider
him
to
invite
him
to
dinner
a
second
time
and
of
the
delicious
ants
he
was
sure
he
would
have
to
eat
what
very
good
taste
buster
bear
has
thought
he
and
how
very
fortunate
it
is
that
he
found
out
that
i
also
am
fond
of
ants
he
was
so
busy
with
these
pleasant
thoughts
and
of
the
good
dinner
that
he
expected
to
have
that
he
took
no
notice
of
what
was
going
on
about
him
he
did
see
his
old
friends
and
neighbors
peeping
out
at
him
and
laughing
because
he
looked
so
foolish
and
silly
he
was
dressed
in
his
very
best
which
was
nothing
at
all
to
be
proud
of
for
you
know
old
toad
has
no
fine
clothes
and
being
puffed
up
so
he
was
homelier
than
ever
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
for
at
best
toad
is
anything
but
handsome
he
was
beginning
to
get
pretty
tired
by
the
time
he
reached
the
green
forest
and
came
in
sight
of
the
rotted
old
chestnut
stump
where
he
was
to
meet
buster
bear
buster
was
waiting
for
him
how
do
you
do
this
fine
day
you
look
a
little
tired
and
rather
warm
toad
said
he
i
am
a
little
warm
replied
toad
in
his
most
polite
manner
although
he
could
help
panting
for
breath
as
he
said
it
i
hope
you
are
feeling
as
well
as
you
are
looking
mr
bear
illustration
i
am
a
little
warm
replied
toad
in
his
most
polite
manner
buster
bear
laughed
a
great
laugh
i
always
feel
fine
when
there
is
a
dinner
of
fat
ants
ready
for
me
said
he
it
is
fine
of
you
to
honor
me
by
coming
to
dine
here
toad
put
one
hand
on
his
stomach
and
tried
to
make
a
very
grand
bow
peter
rabbit
hiding
behind
a
tree
almost
giggled
aloud
he
looked
so
funny
i
have
ventured
to
invite
another
to
enjoy
the
dinner
with
us
continued
buster
bear
toad
face
fell
you
see
he
was
selfish
he
wanted
to
be
the
only
one
to
have
the
honor
of
dining
with
buster
bear
he
a
little
late
went
on
buster
but
i
think
he
will
be
here
soon
and
i
hope
you
will
be
glad
to
meet
him
ah
there
he
comes
now
old
toad
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
buster
bear
was
looking
he
gave
a
little
gasp
and
turned
quite
pale
all
his
puffiness
disappeared
he
did
look
like
the
same
toad
at
all
the
newcomer
was
blacksnake
oh
cried
old
toad
and
then
without
even
asking
to
be
excused
he
turned
his
back
on
buster
bear
and
started
back
the
way
he
had
come
with
long
frightened
hops
ha
ha
ha
shouted
peter
rabbit
jumping
out
from
behind
a
tree
ho
ho
ho
shouted
jimmy
skunk
from
behind
another
hee
hee
hee
shouted
johnny
chuck
from
behind
a
third
then
old
toad
knew
that
his
old
friends
and
neighbors
had
planned
this
to
teach
him
a
lesson
xxiii
old
toad
is
very
humble
when
old
toad
saw
blacksnake
and
turned
his
back
on
buster
bear
and
the
fine
dinner
to
which
buster
had
invited
him
he
had
but
just
one
idea
in
his
head
and
that
was
to
get
out
of
sight
of
blacksnake
as
soon
as
possible
he
forgot
to
ask
buster
bear
to
excuse
him
he
forgot
that
he
was
tired
and
hot
he
forgot
all
the
pride
with
which
he
had
been
so
puffed
up
he
forgot
everything
but
the
need
of
getting
out
of
sight
of
blacksnake
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
so
away
went
old
toad
hop
hop
hop
hop
he
heard
peter
rabbit
and
jimmy
skunk
and
johnny
chuck
and
others
of
his
old
friends
and
neighbors
shouting
with
laughter
yes
and
he
heard
the
deep
laugh
of
buster
bear
but
he
did
mind
it
not
then
anyway
he
had
room
for
any
feeling
except
fear
of
blacksnake
but
old
toad
had
to
stop
after
a
while
you
see
his
legs
were
so
tired
they
just
would
go
any
longer
and
he
was
so
out
of
breath
that
he
wheezed
he
crawled
under
a
big
piece
of
bark
and
there
he
lay
flat
on
the
ground
and
panted
and
panted
for
breath
he
would
stay
there
until
jolly
round
bright
sun
went
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
then
blacksnake
would
go
to
bed
too
and
it
would
be
safe
for
him
to
go
home
now
lying
there
in
the
dark
for
it
was
dark
under
that
big
piece
of
bark
old
toad
had
time
to
think
little
by
little
he
began
to
understand
that
his
invitation
to
dine
with
buster
bear
had
been
part
of
a
plan
by
his
old
friends
and
neighbors
whom
he
had
so
snubbed
and
looked
down
on
when
he
had
been
puffed
up
with
pride
to
teach
him
a
lesson
at
first
he
was
angry
very
angry
indeed
then
he
began
to
see
how
foolish
and
silly
he
had
been
and
shame
took
the
place
of
anger
as
he
remembered
the
deep
laughter
of
buster
bear
the
feeling
of
shame
grew
i
deserve
it
thought
old
toad
yes
sir
i
deserve
every
bit
of
it
the
only
thing
that
i
have
to
be
proud
of
is
that
i
honest
and
work
for
my
living
yes
sir
that
all
when
darkness
came
at
last
and
he
crawled
out
to
go
home
he
was
feeling
very
humble
peter
rabbit
happened
along
just
then
old
toad
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
peter
suddenly
threw
his
head
up
very
high
and
strutted
past
as
if
he
did
see
old
toad
at
all
toad
gulped
and
went
on
pretty
soon
he
met
jimmy
skunk
jimmy
went
right
on
about
his
business
and
actually
stepped
right
over
old
toad
as
if
he
had
been
a
stick
or
a
stone
old
toad
gulped
again
and
went
on
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
see
danny
meadow
mouse
he
meant
to
tell
danny
how
ashamed
he
was
for
the
way
he
had
treated
danny
and
his
other
friends
but
danny
brushed
right
past
without
even
a
glance
at
him
old
toad
gulped
and
started
up
to
see
johnny
chuck
the
same
thing
happened
again
so
it
did
when
he
met
striped
chipmunk
at
last
old
toad
gave
up
and
went
home
where
he
sat
under
a
big
mullein
leaf
the
rest
of
the
day
feeling
very
miserable
and
lonely
he
did
have
appetite
enough
to
snap
at
a
single
fly
late
that
afternoon
he
heard
a
little
noise
and
looked
up
to
find
all
his
old
friends
and
neighbors
forming
a
circle
around
him
suddenly
they
began
to
dance
and
shout
old
toad
is
a
jolly
good
fellow
his
temper
is
sweet
disposition
is
mellow
and
now
that
his
bubble
of
pride
is
quite
busted
we
know
that
he
knows
that
his
friends
can
be
trusted
then
old
toad
knew
that
all
was
well
once
more
and
presently
he
began
to
dance
too
the
funniest
dance
that
ever
was
seen
this
is
all
for
now
about
homely
old
toad
because
i
have
just
got
to
tell
you
about
another
homely
fellow
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
who
carries
a
thousand
little
spears

next
book
will
tell
you
all
about
adventures
