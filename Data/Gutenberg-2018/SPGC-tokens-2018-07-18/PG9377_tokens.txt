across

fields
and
flying
showers
of
sleet
rattled
against
the
old
leathern
coach
as
it
drove
through
the
thickening
dusk
a
bitter
winter
this
year
of
the
royal
tragedy
a
rainy
summer
and
a
mild
rainy
autumn
had
been
followed
by
the
hardest
frost
this
generation
had
ever
known
the
thames
was
frozen
over
and
tempestuous
winds
had
shaken
the
ships
in
the
pool
and
the
steep
gable

and
tall
on

a
winter
which
had
witnessed
the
martyrdom
of

and
the
exile
of
her
chief
nobility
while
a
rabble
parliament
rode
roughshod

prevailed
the

down

the

the
were
desolate
and
a
saddened
population
impoverished
and
depressed
by
the
sacrifices
that
had
been
exacted
and
the
tyranny
that
had
been
exercised
in
the
name
of
liberty
were
ground
under
the
iron
heel
of
the
pitiless
journey
from
london
to
louvain
a
journey
of
many
days
and
nights
prolonged
by
accident
and
difficulty
had
been
spun
out
to
uttermost
tedium
for
those
two
in
the
heavily
moving
old
leathern
coach
who
and
what
were
they
these
wearied
travellers
journeying
together
silently
towards
a
destination
which
promised
but
little
of
pleasure
or
luxury
by
way
of
welcome
a
destination
which
meant
severance
for
those
two
one
was
sir
john
kirkland
of
the
manor
moat
bucks
a
notorious
malignant
a
cavalier
aged
by
trouble
and
hard
fighting
a
soldier
and
servant
who
had
sacrificed
himself
and
his
fortune
for
the
king
and
must
needs
begin
the
world
anew
now
that
his
master
was
murdered
his
own
goods
confiscated
the
old
family
mansion
the
house
in
which
his
parents
died
and
his
children
were
born
emptied
of
all
its
valuables
and
left
to
the
care
of
servants
and
his
master
son
a
wanderer
in
a
foreign
land
with
little
hope
of
ever
winning
back
crown
and
sceptre
sadness
was
the
dominant
expression
of
sir
john
stern
strongly
marked
countenance
as
he
sat
staring
out
at
the
level
landscape
through
the
unglazed
coach
window
staring
blankly
across
those
flemish
fields
where
the
cattle
were
clustering
in
sheltered
corners
a
monotonous
expanse
crossed
by
dykes
that
looked
black
as
ink
save
where
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
touched
their
iron
hue
with
splashes
pollard
willows
indicated
the
edge
of
one
field
gaunt
poplars
marked
the
boundary
of
another
alike
leafless
and
unbeautiful
standing
darkly
out
against
the
dim
grey
sky
night
was
hastening
towards
the
travellers
narrowing
and
blotting
out
that
level
landscape
field
dyke
and
leafless
wood
sir
john
put
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
and
looked
anxiously
along
the
straight
road
peering
through
the
shades
of
evening
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
crocketed
spires
and
fair
cupolas
of
louvain
in
the
distance
but
he
could
see
nothing
save
a
waste
of
level
pastures
and
the
gathering
darkness
not
a
light
anywhere
not
a
sign
of
human
habitation
useless
to
gaze
any
longer
into
the
impenetrable
night
the
traveller
leant
back
into
a
corner
of
the
carriage
with
folded
arms
and
with
a
deep
sigh
composed
himself
for
slumber
he
had
slept
but
little
for
the
last
week
the
passage
from
harwich
to
ostend
in
a
had
been
a
perilous
transit
prolonged
by
adverse
winds
sleep
had
been
impossible
on
board
that
wretched
craft
and
the
land
journey
had
been
fraught
with
vexation
and
delays
of
all
kinds
stupidity
of
postillions
dearth
of
horseflesh
badness
of
the
roads
all
things
that
can
vex
and
hinder

john
travelling

a
small
child
in
a
cloak
and

crept
closer
to
him
in
the
darkness
nestled
up
against
his
elbow
and
pushed
her
little
cold
hand
into
his
leathern
glove
you
are
crying
again
father
she
said
full
of
pity
you
were
crying
last
night
do
you
always
cry
when
it
grows
dark
it
does
not
become
a
man
to
shed
tears
in
the
daylight
little
maid
her
father
answered
gently
is
it
for
the
poor
king
you
are
crying
the
king
those
wicked
men
murdered
ay
angela
for
the
king
and
for
the
queen
and
her
fatherless
children
still
more
than
for
the
king
for
he
has
crowned
himself
with
a
crown
of
glory
the
diadem
of
martyrs
and
is
resting
from
labour
and
sorrow
to
rise
victorious
at
the
great
day
when
his
enemies
and
his
murderers
shall
stand
ashamed
before
him
i
weep
for
that
once
so
lovely
lady
widowed
discrowned
needy
desolate
a
beggar
in
the
land
where
her
father
was
a
great
king
a
hard
fate
angela
father
and
husband
both
murdered
was
the
queen
father
murdered
too
asked
the
voice
out
of
darkness
a
pretty
piping
note
like
the
song
of
a
bird
yes
love
did
bradshaw
murder
him
no
dearest
was
in
france
he
was
slain
in
paris
stabbed
to
death
by
a
madman
and
was
the
queen
sorry
ay
sweetheart
she
has
drained
the
cup
of
sorrow
she
was
but
a
child
when
her
father
died
she
can
but
dimly
remember
that
dreadful
day
and
now
she
sits
banished
and
widowed
to
hear
of
her
husband
martyrdom
her
elder
sons
wanderers
her
young
daughter
a
prisoner
poor
queen
piped
the
small
sweet
voice
i
am
so
sorry
for
her
little
had
she
ever
known
but
sorrow
this
child
of
the
great
rebellion
born
in
the
old
buckinghamshire
manor
house
while
her
father
was
at
falmouth
with
the
prince
born
in
the
midst
of
civil
war
a
stormy
petrel
bringing
no
message
of
peace
from
those
unknown
skies
whence
she
came
a
harbinger
of
woe
infant
eyes
love
bright
colours
this
baby
eyes
looked
upon
a
house
hung
with
black
her
mother
died
before
the
child
was
a
fortnight
old
they
had
christened
her
angela
angel
of
death
said
the
father
when
the
news
of
his
loss
reached
him
after
the
lapse
of
many
days
his
fair
young
wife
coffin
was
in
the
family
vault
under
the
parish
church
of
nicholas
in
the
vale
before
he
knew
that
he
had
lost
her
there
was
an
elder
daughter
hyacinth
seven
years
the
senior
who
had
been
sent
across
the
channel
in
the
care
of
an
old
servant
at
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
between
king
and
parliament
she
had
been
placed
in
the
charge
of
her
maternal
grandmother
the
marquise
de
montrond
who
had
taken
ship
for
calais
when
the
court
left
london
leaving
her
royal
mistress
to
weather
the
storm
a
lady
who
had
wealth
and
prestige
in
her
own
country
who
had
been
a
famous
beauty
when
richelieu
was
in
power
and
who
had
been
admired
by
that
serious
and
sober
monarch
louis
the
thirteenth
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
put
up
with
the
shifts
and
shortcomings
of
an
oxford
with
the
fear
of
finding
herself
in
a
town
besieged
by
lord
essex
and
the
rebel
army
with
madame
de
montrond
hyacinth
had
been
reared
partly
in
a
mediaeval
mansion
with
a
portcullis
and
four
squat
towers
near
the
ch√¢teau
and
partly
in
paris
where
the
lady
had
a
fine
house
in
the
marais
the
sisters
had
never
looked
upon
each
other
faces
angela
having
entered
upon
the
troubled
scene
after
hyacinth
had
been
carried
across
the
channel
to
her
grandmother
and
now
the
father
was
racked
with
anxiety
lest
evil
should
befall
that
elder
daughter
in
the
war
between
mazarin
and
the
parliament
which
was
reported
to
rage
with
increasing
fury
angela
awakening
reason
became
conscious
of
a
world
where
all
was
fear
and
sadness
the
stories
she
heard
in
her
childhood
were
stories
of
that
fierce
war
which
was
reaching
its
disastrous
close
while
she
was
in
her
cradle
she
was
told
of
the
happy
peaceful
england
of
old
before
darkness
and
confusion
gathered
over
the
land
before
the
hearts
of
the
people
were
set
against
their
king
by
a
wicked
and
rebellious
parliament
she
heard
of
battles
lost
by
the
king
and
his
partisans
cities
besieged
and
taken
a
flash
of
victory
followed
by
humiliating
reverses
the
party
always
at
a
disadvantage
and
hence
the
falling
away
of
the
feeble
and
the
false
the
treachery
of
those
who
had
seemed
friends
the
impotence
of
the
faithful
angela
heard
so
often
and
so
much
of
these
things
from
old
lady
kirkland
her
grandmother
and
from
the
servants
at
the
manor
that
she
grew
to
understand
them
with
a
comprehension
seemingly
far
beyond
her
tender
years
but
a
child
so
reared
is
inevitably
older
than
her
years
this
little
one
had
never
known
childish
pleasures
or
play
childish
companions
or
childish
fancies
she
roamed
about
the
spacious
gardens
full
of
saddest
thoughts
burdened
with
all
the
cares
that
weighed
down
that
kingly
head
yonder
or
she
stood
before
the
pictured
face
of
the
monarch
with
clasped
hands
and
tearful
eyes
looking
up
at
him
with
the
adoring
compassion
of
a
child
prone
to
thinking
of
him
already
as
saint
and
martyr
whose
martyrdom
was
not
yet
consummated
in
blood
king
charles
had
presented
his
faithful
servant
sir
john
kirkland
with
a
replica
of
one
of
his
vandyke
portraits
a
beautiful
head
with
a
strange
inward
look
that
look
of
isolation
and
aloofness
which
we
who
know
his
story
take
for
a
prophecy
of
doom
which
the
sculptor
bernini
had
remarked
when
he
modelled
the
royal
head
for
marble
the
picture
hung
in
the
place
of
honour
in
the
long
narrow
gallery
at
the
manor
moat
with
trophies
of
flodden
and
zutphen
arranged
against
the
blackened
oak
panelling
above
it
the
kirklands
had
been
a
race
of
soldiers
since
the
days
of
edward
iii
the
house
was
full
of
decorations
tattered
colours
old
armour
memorials
of
fighting
kirklands
who
had
long
been
dust
there
came
an
evil
day
when
the
rabble
rout
of
cromwell
soldiery
burst
into
the
manor
house
to
pillage
and
destroy
carrying
off
curios
and
relics
that
were
the
gradual
accumulation
of
a
century
and
a
half
of
peaceful
occupation
the
old
dowager
grey
hairs
had
barely
saved
her
from
outrage
on
that
bitter
day
it
was
only
her
utter
helplessness
and
afflicted
condition
that
prevailed
upon
the
parliamentary
captain
and
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
his
design
which
was
to
haul
her
off
to
one
of
those
london
prisons
at
that
time
so
gorged
with
royalist
captives
that
the
devilish
ingenuity
of
the
parliament
had
devised
floating
gaols
on
the
thames
where
persons
of
quality
and
character
were
herded
together
below
decks
to
the
loss
of
health
and
even
of
life
happily
for
old
lady
kirkland
she
was
too
lame
to
walk
and
her
enemies
had
no
horse
or
carriage
in
which
to
convey
her
so
she
was
left
at
peace
in
her
son
plundered
mansion
whence
all
that
was
valuable
and
easily
portable
was
carried
away
by
the
roundheads
silver
plate
and
family
plate
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
king
necessities
the
pictures
not
being
either
portable
or
readily
convertible
into
cash
had
remained
on
the
old
panelled
walls
angela
used
to
go
from
the
king
picture
to
her
father
sir
john
was
a
more
rugged
face
than
the
stuart
with
a
harder
expression
but
the
child
heart
went
out
to
the
image
of
the
father
she
had
never
seen
since
the
dawn
of
consciousness
he
had
made
a
hurried
journey
to
that
quiet
buckinghamshire
valley
soon
after
her
birth
had
looked
at
the
baby
in
her
cradle
and
then
had
gone
down
into
the
vault
where
his
young
wife
was
lying
and
had
stayed
for
more
than
an
hour
in
cold
and
darkness
alone
with
his
dead
that
lovely
french
wife
had
been
his
junior
by
more
than
twenty
years
and
he
had
loved
her
passionately
had
loved
her
and
left
her
for
duty
sake
no
kirkland
had
ever
faltered
in
his
fidelity
to
crown
and
king
this
john
kirkland
had
sacrificed
all
things
and
alone
with
his
beloved
dead
in
the
darkness
of
that
narrow
charnel
house
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
except
to
cleave
to
those
fallen
fortunes
and
patiently
await
the
issue
he
had
fought
in
many
battles
and
had
escaped
with
a
few
scars
and
he
was
carrying
his
daughter
to
louvain
intending
to
place
her
in
the
charge
of
her
madame
de
montrond
half
sister
who
was
head
of
a
convent
in
that
city
a
safe
and
pious
shelter
where
the
child
might
be
reared
in
her
mother
faith
lady
kirkland
the
only
daughter
of
the
marquise
de
montrond
one
of
queen
henrietta
maria
had
been
a
papist
and
although
sir
john
had
adhered
steadfastly
to
the
principles
of
the
reformed
church
he
had
promised
his
bride
and
the
marquise
her
mother
that
if
their
nuptials
were
blessed
with
offspring
their
children
should
be
educated
in
the
roman
faith
a
promise
difficult
of
performance
in
a
land
where
a
stormy
tide
ran
high
against
rome
and
where
popery
was
a
scarlet
spectre
that
alarmed
the
ignorant
and
maddened
the
bigoted
and
now
duly
provided
with
a
safe
conduct
from
the
regicide
bradshaw
he
was
journeying
to
the
city
where
he
was
to
part
with
his
daughter
for
an
indefinite
period
he
had
seen
but
little
of
her
and
yet
it
seemed
as
hard
to
part
thus
as
if
she
had
prattled
at
his
knees
and
nestled
in
his
arms
every
day
of
her
young
life
at
last
across
the
distance
against
the
clouds
of
that
stormy
winter
sky
john
kirkland
saw
the
lights
of
the
city
not
many
lights
or
brilliant
of
their
kind
but
a
glimmer
here
and
there
and
behind
the
glimmer
the
dark
bulk
of
masonry
roofs
steeples
bridges
the
carriage
stopped
at
one
of
the
gates
of
the
city
and
there
were
questions
asked
and
answered
and
papers
shown
but
there
was
no
obstacle
to
the
entrance
of
the
travellers
the
name
of
the
ursuline
convent
acted
like
a
charm
for
louvain
was
papist
to
the
core
in
these
days
of
spanish
dominion
it
had
been
a
city
of
refuge
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
for
all
that
was
truest
and
bravest
and
noblest
among
english
roman
catholics
in
the
cruel
days
of
queen
elizabeth
and
englishmen
had
become
the
leading
spirits
of
the
university
there
and
had
attracted
the
youth
of
romanist
england
to
the
sober
old
flemish
town
before
the
establishment
of
allan
rival
seminary
at
douai
sir
john
could
have
found
no
safer
haven
for
his
little
ewe
lamb
the
tired
horses
blundered
heavily
along
the
stony
streets
and
crossed
more
than
one
bridge
the
town
seemed
pervaded
by
water
a
deep
narrow
stream
like
a
canal
on
which
the
houses
looked
as
if
in
feeble
mockery
of
venice
houses
with
steep
gables
some
of
them
richly
decorated
narrow
windows
for
the
most
part
dark
but
with
here
and
there
the
yellow
light
of
lamp
or
candle
the
convent
faced
a
broad
open
square
and
had
a
large
walled
garden
in
its
rear
the
coach
stopped
in
front
of
a
handsome
doorway
and
after
the
travellers
had
been
scrutinised
and
interrogated
by
the
portress
through
an
opening
in
the
door
they
were
admitted
into
a
spacious
hall
paved
with
black
and
white
marble
and
adorned
with
a
statue
of
the
virgin
mother
and
thence
to
a
parlour
dimly
lighted
by
a
small
oil
lamp
where
they
waited
for
about
ten
minutes
the
little
girl
shivering
with
cold
before
the
superior
appeared
she
was
a
tall
woman
advanced
in
years
with
a
handsome
but
melancholy
countenance
she
greeted
the
cavalier
as
a
familiar
friend
welcome
to
flanders
she
said
you
have
fled
from
that
accursed
country
where
our
church
is
despised
and
persecuted
nay
reverend
kinswoman
i
have
fled
but
to
go
back
again
as
fast
as
horses
and
sails
can
carry
me
while
the
fortunes
of
my
king
are
at
stake
my
place
is
in
england
or
it
may
be
in
scotland
where
there
are
still
those
who
are
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
in
the
royal
cause
but
i
have
brought
this
little
one
for
shelter
and
safe
keeping
and
tender
usage
trusting
in
you
who
are
of
kin
to
her
as
i
could
trust
no
one
else
and
furthermore
that
she
may
be
reared
in
the
faith
of
her
dead
mother
sweet
soul
murmured
the
nun
it
was
well
for
her
to
be
taken
from
your
troubled
england
to
the
kingdom
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
true
reverend
mother
yet
those
blasphemous
levellers
who
call
us
have
dubbed
themselves
then
affairs
go
no
better
with
you
in
england
i
fear
sir
john
nay
madam
they
go
so
ill
that
they
have
reached
the
lowest
depth
of
infamy
hell
itself
hath
seen
no
spectacle
more
awful
no
murder
more
barbarous
no
horrider
triumph
of
wickedness
than
the
crime
which
was
perpetrated
this
day
at
whitehall
the
nun
looked
at
him
wistfully
with
clasped
hands
as
one
who
half
apprehended
his
meaning
the
king
she
faltered
still
a
prisoner
ay
reverend
lady
but
a
prisoner
in
paradise
where
angels
are
his
guards
and
saints
and
martyrs
his
companions
he
has
regained
his
crown
but
it
is
the
crown
of
martyrdom
the
aureole
of
slaughtered
saints
england
our
little
england
that
was
once
so
great
under
the
strong
rule
of
that
who
made
herself
the
arbiter
of
christendom
and
the
wonder
of
the
world
the
pious
lady
shivered
and
crossed
herself
at
this
praise
of
the
heretic
queen
praise
that
could
only
come
from
a
heretic
our
blessed
and
peaceful
england
has
become
a
den
of
thieves
given
over
to
the
ravening
wolves
of
rebellion
and
dissent
the
penniless
soldiery
who
would
bring
down
all
men
fortunes
to
their
own
level
seize
all
eat
and
drink
all
and
trample
crown
and
peerage
in
the
mire
they
have
slain
him
reverend
mother
this
impious
herd
they
gave
him
the
mockery
of
a
trial
just
as
his
master
christ
was
mocked
they
spurned
and
spat
upon
him
even
as
our
redeemer
was
spurned
and
then
on
the
sabbath
day
they
cried
aloud
in
their
conventicles
hast
thou
not
smelt
a
sweet
savour
of
blood
ay
these
murderers
gloried
in
their
crime
bragged
of
their
gory
hands
lifted
them
up
towards
heaven
as
a
token
of
righteousness
the
cavalier
was
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
dimness
of
the
convent
parlour
with
quick
agitated
steps
his
nostrils
quivering
grizzled
brows
bent
over
angry
eyes
his
hand
trembling
with
rage
as
it
clutched
his
the
reverend
mother
drew
angela
to
her
side
took
off
the
little
black
silk
hood
and
laid
her
hand
caressingly
on
the
soft
brown
hair
was
it
cromwell
work
she
asked
nay
reverend
mother
i
doubt
whether
of
his
own
accord
cromwell
would
have
done
this
thing
he
is
a
villain
a
damnable
villain
but
he
is
a
glorious
villain
the
parliament
had
made
their
covenant
with
the
king
at
newport
a
bargain
which
gave
them
all
and
left
him
nothing
save
only
his
broken
health
grey
hairs
and
the
bare
name
of
king
he
would
have
been
but
a
phantom
of
authority
powerless
as
the
royal
spectres
aeneas
met
in
the
they
had
got
all
from
him
all
save
the
betrayal
of
his
friends
there
he
budged
not
but
was
firm
as
rock
was
likely
he
remembered
strafford
and
that
he
prospered
no
better
for
having
flung
a
faithful
dog
to
the
wolves
said
the
nun
remembered
strafford
ay
that
memory
has
been
a
pillow
of
thorns
through
many
a
sleepless
night
no
it
was
not
cromwell
who
sought
the
blood
it
has
been
shed
with
his
sanction
the
parliament
had
got
all
and
would
have
been
content
but
the
faction
they
had
created
was
too
strong
for
them
the
levellers
sent
their
spokesman
one
pride
an
now
colonel
of
horse
to
the
door
of
the
house
of
commons
who
arrested
the
more
faithful
and
moderate
members
imposed
himself
and
his
rebel
crew
upon
the
house
and
hurried
on
that
violation
of
constitutional
law
that
travesty
of
justice
which
compelled
an
anointed
king
to
stand
before
the
lowest
of
his
subjects
the
of
a
mutinous
commonalty
to
answer
for
having
fought
in
defence
of
his
own
inviolable
rights
did
they
dare
condemn
their
king
ah
madam
they
found
him
guilty
of
high
treason
in
that
he
had
taken
arms
against
the
parliament
they
sentenced
their
royal
master
to
death
and
seven
days
ago
london
saw
the
spectacle
of
judicial
murder
a
blameless
king
slain
by
the
minion
of
an
armed
rabble
but
did
the
people
the
english
people
suffer
this
in
silence
the
wisest
and
best
of
them
could
surely
be
assembled
in
your
great
city
did
the
citizens
of
london
stand
placidly
by
to
see
this
deed
accomplished
they
were
like
sheep
before
the
shearer
they
were
dumb
great
god
can
i
ever
forget
that
sea
of
white
faces
under
the
grey
winter
sky
or
the
universal
groan
that
went
up
to
heaven
when
the
stroke
of
the
axe
sounded
on
the
block
and
men
knew
that
the
murder
of
their
king
was
consummated
and
when
that
anointed
head
with
its
grey
hairs
whitened
with
sorrow
mark
you
not
with
age
was
lifted
up
bloody
terrible
and
proclaimed
the
head
of
a
traitor
ah
reverend
mother
ten
such
moments
will
age
a
man
by
ten
years
was
it
not
the
most
portentous
tragedy
which
the
earth
has
ever
seen
since
he
who
was
both
god
and
man
died
upon
calvary
other
judicial
sacrifices
have
been
but
never
of
a
victim
as
guiltless
and
as
noble
had
you
but
seen
the
calm
beauty
of
his
countenance
as
he
turned
it
towards
the
people
oh
my
king
my
master
my
beloved
friend
when
shall
i
see
that
face
in
paradise
with
the
blood
washed
from
that
royal
brow
with
the
smile
of
the
redeemed
upon
those
lips
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
covered
his
face
with
those
hands
which
had
broadened
by
much
grasping
of
sword
and
pistol
pike
and
gun
and
sobbed
aloud
with
a
fierce
passion
that
convulsed
the
strong
muscular
frame
of
all
the
king
servants
this
one
had
been
the
most
steadfast
was
marked
in
the
black
book
of
the
parliament
as
a
notorious
malignant
from
the
raising
of
the
standard
on
the
at
nottingham
in
the
sad
evening
of
a
tempestuous
day
with
but
scanty
attendance
and
only
evil
presages
to
the
treaty
at
newport
and
the
prison
on
the
low
hampshire
coast
this
man
had
been
his
master
constant
companion
and
friend
fighting
in
every
battle
cleaving
to
king
and
prince
in
spite
of
every
opposing
influence
carrying
letters
between
father
and
son
in
the
teeth
of
the
enemy
humbling
himself
as
a
servant
and
performing
menial
labours
in
those
latter
days
of
bitterness
and
outrage
when
all
courtly
surroundings
were
denied
the
fallen
monarch
and
now
he
mourned
his
martyred
king
more
bitterly
than
he
would
have
mourned
his
own
brother
the
little
girl
slipped
from
the
reverend
mother
lap
and
ran
across
the
room
to
her
father
do
cry
father
she
murmured
with
her
own
eyes
streaming
it
hurts
me
to
see
you
nay
angela
he
answered
clasping
her
to
his
breast
forgive
me
that
i
think
more
of
my
dead
king
than
of
my
living
daughter
poor
child
thou
hast
seen
nothing
but
sorrow
since
thou
wert
born
a
land
racked
by
civil
war
englishmen
changed
into
devils
a
home
ravaged
and
made
desolate
threatenings
and
curses
thy
good
grandmother
days
shortened
by
sorrow
and
rough
usage
thou
wert
born
into
a
house
of
mourning
and
hast
seen
nothing
but
black
since
thou
hadst
eyes
to
notice
the
things
around
thee
those
tender
ears
should
have
heard
only
loving
words
but
it
is
over
dearest
and
thou
hast
found
a
haven
within
these
walls
you
will
take
care
of
her
will
you
not
madam
for
the
sake
of
the
niece
you
loved
she
shall
be
the
apple
of
my
eye
no
evil
shall
come
near
her
that
my
care
and
my
prayers
can
avert
god
has
been
very
gracious
to
our
order
in
all
troublous
times
we
have
been
protected
we
have
many
pupils
from
the
best
families
of
flanders
and
some
even
from
paris
whence
parents
are
glad
to
remove
their
children
from
the
confusion
of
the
time
you
need
fear
nothing
while
this
sweet
child
is
with
us
and
if
in
years
to
come
she
should
desire
to
enter
our
order
the
lord
forbid
cried
the
cavalier
i
want
her
to
be
a
good
and
pious
papist
madam
like
her
sweet
mother
but
never
a
nun
i
look
to
her
as
the
staff
and
comfort
of
my
declining
years
thou
wilt
not
abandon
thy
father
wilt
thou
little
one
when
thou
shalt
be
tall
and
strong
as
a
bulrush
and
he
shall
be
bent
and
gnarled
with
age
like
the
old
medlar
on
the
lawn
at
the
manor
thou
wilt
be
his
rod
and
staff
wilt
thou
not
sweetheart
the
child
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
it
was
her
only
answer
but
that
mute
reply
was
a
vow
thou
wilt
stay
here
till
england
troubles
are
over
angela
and
that
base
herd
yonder
have
been
trampled
down
thou
wilt
be
happy
here
and
wilt
mind
thy
book
and
be
obedient
to
those
good
ladies
who
will
teach
thee
and
some
day
when
our
country
is
at
peace
i
will
come
back
to
fetch
thee
soon
murmured
the
child
soon
father
god
grant
it
may
be
soon
my
beloved
it
is
hard
for
father
and
children
to
be
scattered
as
we
are
scattered
thy
sister
hyacinth
in
paris
and
thou
in
flanders
and
i
in
england
yet
it
must
needs
be
so
for
a
while
why
should
not
hyacinth
come
to
us
and
be
reared
with
angela
asked
the
reverend
mother
nay
madam
hyacinth
is
well
cared
for
with
your
sister
madame
de
montrond
she
is
as
dear
to
her
maternal
grandmother
as
this
little
one
here
was
to
my
good
mother
whose
death
last
year
left
us
a
house
of
mourning
hyacinth
will
doubtless
inherit
a
considerable
portion
of
madame
de
montrond
wealth
which
is
not
insignificant
she
is
being
brought
up
in
the
precincts
of
the
court
a
worldly
and
a
dangerous
school
for
one
so
young
said
the
nun
with
a
sigh
i
have
heard
my
father
talk
of
what
life
was
like
at
the
louvre
when
the
b√©arnais
reigned
there
in
the
flower
of
his
manhood
newly
master
of
paris
flushed
with
victory
and
but
lately
reconciled
to
the
church
methinks
that
great
captain
court
must
have
been
laxer
than
that
of
queen
anne
and
the
cardinal
i
have
been
told
that
the
is
being
reared
as
it
were
in
a
cloister
so
strict
are
mother
and
guardian
my
only
fear
for
hyacinth
is
the
troubled
state
of
the
city
given
over
to
civil
warfare
only
less
virulent
than
that
which
has
desolated
england
i
hear
that
the
fronde
is
no
war
of
epigrams
and
pamphlets
but
that
men
are
as
earnest
and
bloodthirsty
as
they
were
in
the
league
i
shall
go
from
here
to
paris
to
see
my
before
i
make
my
way
back
to
london
i
question
if
you
will
find
her
at
paris
said
the
reverend
mother
i
had
news
from
a
priest
in
the
diocese
of
the
coadjutor
the
left
the
city
secretly
with
her
chosen
favourites
in
the
dead
of
the
night
on
the
sixth
of
this
month
after
having
kept
the
festival
of
twelfth
night
in
a
merry
humour
with
her
court
even
her
knew
nothing
of
her
plans
they
went
to
germain
where
they
found
the
chateau
unfurnished
and
where
all
the
court
had
to
sleep
upon
was
a
few
loads
of
straw
hatred
of
the
cardinal
is
growing
fiercer
every
day
and
paris
is
in
a
state
of
siege
the
princes
are
siding
with
mathieu
mol√©
and
his
parliament
and
the
provincial
parliaments
are
taking
up
the
quarrel
god
grant
that
it
may
not
be
in
france
as
it
has
been
with
you
in
your
unhappy
england
but
i
fear
the
spanish
queen
and
her
italian
minister
scarce
know
the
temper
of
the
french
people
alas
good
friend
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
days
and
the
spirit
of
revolt
is
everywhere
but
if
there
is
trouble
at
the
french
court
there
is
all
the
more
need
that
i
should
make
my
way
thither
be
it
at
germain
or
at
paris
and
so
assure
myself
of
my
pretty
hyacinth
safety
she
was
so
sweet
an
infant
when
my
good
and
faithful
steward
carried
her
across
the
sea
to
dieppe
never
shall
i
forget
that
sad
moment
of
parting
when
the
baby
arms
were
wreathed
round
my
sweet
saint
neck
she
so
soon
to
become
again
a
mother
so
brave
and
patient
in
her
sorrow
at
parting
with
her
ah
sister
there
are
moments
in
this
life
that
a
man
must
needs
remember
even
amidst
the
wreck
of
his
country
he
dashed
away
a
tear
or
two
and
then
turned
to
his
kinswoman
with
outstretched
hands
and
said
good
night
dear
and
reverend
mother
good
night
and
i
shall
sleep
at
the
nearest
inn
and
shall
be
on
the
road
again
at
daybreak
my
soul
delight
he
clasped
his
daughter
in
his
arms
with
something
of
despair
in
the
fervour
of
his
embrace
telling
himself
as
the
soft
cheek
was
pressed
against
his
own
how
many
years
might
pass
ere
he
would
again
so
clasp
that
tender
form
and
feel
those
innocent
kisses
on
his
bearded
lips
she
and
the
elder
girl
were
all
that
were
left
to
him
of
love
and
comfort
and
the
elder
sister
had
been
taken
from
him
while
she
was
a
little
child
he
would
not
have
known
her
had
he
met
her
unawares
nor
had
he
ever
felt
for
her
such
a
pathetic
love
as
for
this
guiltless
this
baby
whose
coming
had
ruined
his
life
whose
love
was
nevertheless
the
only
drop
of
sweetness
in
his
cup
he
plucked
himself
from
that
gentle
embrace
and
walked
quickly
to
the
door
you
will
apply
to
me
for
whatever
money
is
needed
for
the
maintenance
and
education
he
said
and
in
the
next
moment
was
gone
chapter
ii
within
convent
walls
more
than
ten
years
had
come
and
gone
since
that
bleak
february
evening
when
sir
john
kirkland
carried
his
little
daughter
to
a
place
of
safety
in
the
old
city
of
louvain
and
in
all
those
years
the
child
had
grown
like
a
flower
in
a
sheltered
garden
where
cold
winds
never
come
the
bud
had
matured
into
the
blossom
in
that
mild
atmosphere
of
piety
and
peace
and
now
in
this
fair
springtide
of
a
girlish
face
watched
from
the
convent
casement
for
the
coming
of
the
father
whom
angela
kirkland
had
not
looked
upon
since
she
was
a
child
and
the
sister
she
had
never
seen
they
were
to
arrive
father
and
sister
on
a
brief
visit
to
the
quiet
flemish
city
yonder
in
england
there
had
been
curious
changes
since
the
stern
protector
turned
his
rugged
face
to
the
wall
and
laid
down
that
golden
sceptre
with
which
he
had
ruled
as
with
a
rod
of
iron
kingly
title
he
none
yet
where
kings
had
chastised
with
whips
he
had
chastised
with
scorpions
ireland
could
tell
how
the
little
finger
of
cromwell
had
been
heavier
than
the
arm
of
the
stuarts
she
had
trembled
and
had
obeyed
and
had
prospered
under
that
scorpion
rule
and
england
armaments
had
been
the
terror
of
every
sea
while
cromwell
stood
at
the
helm
but
now
that
strong
brain
and
bold
heart
were
in
the
dust
and
it
had
taken
england
little
more
than
a
year
to
discover
that
puritanism
and
the
rump
were
a
mistake
and
that
to
the
core
of
her
heart
she
was
loyal
to
her
hereditary
king
she
asked
not
what
manner
of
man
this
hereditary
ruler
might
be
asked
not
whether
he
were
wise
or
foolish
faithful
or
treacherous
she
forgot
all
of
tyranny
and
of
she
had
suffered
from
his
forbears
she
forgot
even
her
terror
of
the
scarlet
spectre
the
grim
wolf
of
rome
in
her
disgust
at
puritan
fervour
which
had
torn
down
usurped
church
pulpits
destroyed
the
beauty
of
ancient
cathedrals
like
a
woman
or
a
child
she
held
out
her
arms
to
the
unknown
in
a
natural
recoil
from
that
iron
rule
which
had
extinguished
her
gaiety
silenced
her
noble
liturgy
made
innocent
pleasures
and
elegant
arts
things
forbidden
she
wanted
her
churches
and
her
theatres
her
and
taverns
and
and
maypoles
back
again
she
wanted
to
be
ruled
by
the
law
and
not
by
the
sword
and
she
longed
with
a
romantic
longing
for
that
young
wanderer
who
had
fled
from
her
shores
in
a
with
his
life
in
his
hand
to
return
in
a
glad
procession
of
great
ships
dancing
over
summer
seas
eating
drinking
gaming
in
a
coat
worth
scarce
thirty
shillings
and
with
empty
pockets
for
his
loyal
subjects
to
make
haste
and
fill
angela
had
the
convent
parlour
all
to
herself
this
fair
spring
morning
she
was
the
favourite
pupil
of
the
nuns
had
taken
no
vows
pledged
herself
to
no
noviciate
ever
mindful
of
her
promise
to
her
father
she
had
lived
as
happily
and
as
merrily
in
that
abode
of
piety
as
she
could
have
lived
in
the
finest
palace
in
europe
there
were
other
maidens
daughters
of
the
french
and
flemish
nobility
who
were
taught
and
reared
within
those
sombre
precincts
and
with
them
she
had
played
and
worked
and
laboured
at
such
studies
as
became
a
young
lady
of
quality
like
that
fair
daughter
of
affliction
henrietta
of
england
she
had
gained
in
education
by
the
troubles
which
had
made
her
girlhood
a
time
of
seclusion
she
had
been
first
the
plaything
of
those
elder
girls
who
were
finishing
their
education
in
the
convent
her
childishness
appealing
to
their
love
and
pity
and
then
after
being
the
plaything
of
the
nuns
and
the
elder
pupils
she
became
the
favourite
of
her
contemporaries
and
in
a
manner
their
queen
she
was
more
thoughtful
than
her
in
advance
of
her
years
in
piety
and
intelligence
and
they
knowing
her
sad
story
how
she
was
severed
from
her
country
and
kindred
her
father
a
wanderer
with
his
king
her
sister
bred
up
at
a
foreign
court
had
first
compassionated
and
then
admired
her
from
her
twelfth
year
upwards
her
intellectual
superiority
had
been
recognised
in
the
convent
alike
by
the
nuns
and
their
pupils
her
aptitude
at
all
learning
and
her
simple
but
profound
piety
had
impressed
everybody
at
fourteen
years
of
age
they
had
christened
her
the
little
wonder
but
later
seeing
that
their
praises
embarrassed
and
even
distressed
her
they
had
desisted
from
such
loving
flatteries
and
were
content
to
worship
her
with
a
silent
adulation
her
father
visits
to
the
flemish
city
had
been
few
and
far
apart
fondly
though
he
loved
his
motherless
girl
he
had
been
a
wanderer
for
the
most
part
during
those
years
tossed
upon
troubled
seas
fighting
with
cond√©
against
mazarin
and
anne
of
austria
and
reconciled
with
the
court
later
when
peace
was
made
and
his
friends
the
princes
were
forgiven
an
exile
from
france
of
his
own
free
will
when
louis
banished
his
first
cousin
the
king
of
england
in
order
to
truckle
to
the
triumphant
usurper
he
had
led
an
adventurous
life
and
had
cared
very
little
what
became
of
him
in
a
world
but
now
all
things
were
changed
richard
brief
and
irresolute
rule
had
shattered
the
commonwealth
and
made
englishmen
eager
for
a
king
the
country
was
already
tired
of
him
whose
succession
had
been
admitted
with
blank
acquiescence
and
monk
and
the
army
were
soon
to
become
masters
of
the
situation
there
was
hope
that
the
general
was
rightly
affected
and
that
the
king
would
have
his
own
again
and
that
such
of
his
followers
as
had
not
compounded
with
the
parliamentary
commission
would
get
back
their
confiscated
estates
and
that
all
who
had
suffered
in
person
or
pocket
for
loyalty
sake
would
be
recompensed
for
their
sacrifices
it
was
five
years
since
sir
john
last
appearance
at
the
convent
and
angela
heart
beat
fast
at
the
thought
that
he
was
so
near
she
was
to
see
him
this
very
day
nay
perhaps
this
very
hour
his
coach
might
have
passed
the
gate
of
the
town
already
he
was
bringing
his
elder
daughter
with
him
that
sister
whose
face
she
had
never
seen
save
in
a
miniature
and
who
was
now
a
great
lady
the
wife
of
baron
fareham
of
chilton
abbey
oxon
fareham
park
in
the
county
of
hants
and
fareham
house
london
a
nobleman
whose
estates
had
come
through
the
ordeal
of
the
parliamentary
commission
with
a
reasonable
fine
and
to
whom
extra
favour
had
been
shown
by
the
commissioners
because
he
was
known
to
be
at
heart
a
republican
in
the
mean
time
lady
fareham
had
a
liberal
income
allowed
her
by
the
marquise
her
grandmother
and
she
and
her
husband
had
been
among
the
most
splendid
foreigners
at
the
french
court
where
the
lady
beauty
and
wit
had
placed
her
conspicuously
in
that
galaxy
of
brilliant
women
who
shone
and
sparkled
about
the
sun
of
the
european
firmament
le
roi
soleil
or
the
king
par
excellence
who
took
the
blazing
sun
for
his
crest
the
fronde
had
been
a
time
of
pleasurable
excitement
to
the
girl
whose
mixed
blood
ran
like
quicksilver
and
who
delighted
in
danger
and
party
strife
stratagem
and
intrigue
the
story
of
her
courage
and
gaiety
of
heart
in
the
siege
of
paris
she
being
then
little
more
than
a
child
had
reached
the
flemish
convent
long
after
the
acts
recorded
had
been
forgotten
at
paris
and
germain
angela
heart
beat
fast
at
the
thought
of
being
restored
to
these
dear
ones
were
it
only
for
a
short
span
they
were
not
going
to
carry
her
away
from
the
convent
and
indeed
seeing
that
she
so
loved
her
aunt
the
good
reverend
mother
and
that
her
heart
cleaved
to
those
walls
and
to
the
holy
exercises
which
filled
so
great
a
part
of
her
life
her
father
in
replying
to
a
letter
in
which
she
had
besought
him
to
release
her
from
her
promise
and
allow
her
to
dedicate
herself
to
god
had
told
her
that
although
he
could
not
surrender
his
daughter
to
whom
he
looked
for
the
comfort
of
his
closing
years
he
would
not
urge
her
to
leave
the
ursulines
until
he
should
feel
himself
old
and
feeble
and
in
need
of
her
tender
care
meanwhile
she
might
be
a
nun
in
all
but
the
vows
and
a
dutiful
niece
to
her
kind
aunt
mother
anastasia
whose
advanced
years
and
failing
health
needed
all
consideration
but
now
before
he
went
back
to
england
whither
he
hoped
to
accompany
the
king
and
the
princes
ere
the
year
was
much
older
sir
john
kirkland
was
coming
to
visit
his
younger
daughter
bringing
lady
fareham
whose
husband
was
now
in
attendance
upon
his
majesty
in
holland
where
there
were
serious
negotiations
on
hand
negotiations
which
would
have
been
full
of
peril
to
the
english
messengers
two
years
ago
when
that
excellent
preacher
and
holy
man
hewer
of
gregory
was
beheaded
for
having
intelligence
with
the
king
through
the
marquess
of
ormond
the
parlour
window
jutted
into
the
square
over
against
the
town
hall
and
angela
could
see
the
whole
length
of
the
narrow
street
along
which
her
father
carriage
must
come
the
tall
slim
figure
and
the
fair
girlish
face
stood
out
in
full
relief
against
the
grey
stone
mullion
bathed
in
sunlight
the
graceful
form
was
undisguised
by
courtly
apparel
the
soft
brown
hair
fell
in
loose
ringlets
which
were
drawn
back
from
the
brow
by
a
band
of
black
ribbon
the
gown
was
of
soft
grey
woollen
stuff
relieved
by
a
cambric
collar
covering
the
shoulders
and
by
cambric
a
coral
and
silver
rosary
was
her
only
ornament
but
face
and
form
needed
no
aid
from
satins
or
velvets
venetian
lace
or
indian
filagree
the
sweet
serious
face
was
chiefly
notable
for
eyes
of
darkest
grey
under
brows
that
were
firmly
arched
and
almost
black
the
hair
was
a
dark
brown
the
complexion
somewhat
too
pale
for
beauty
indeed
that
colouring
made
some
people
blind
to
the
fine
and
regular
modelling
of
the
face
while
there
were
others
who
saw
no
charm
in
a
countenance
which
seemed
too
thoughtful
for
early
youth
and
therefore
lacking
in
one
of
youth
chief
attractions
gladness
the
face
lighted
suddenly
at
this
moment
as
four
great
grey
flanders
horses
came
clattering
along
the
narrow
street
and
into
the
square
dragging
a
heavy
painted
wooden
coach
after
them
the
girl
opened
the
casement
and
craned
out
her
neck
to
look
at
the
arrival
the
coach
stopped
at
the
convent
door
and
a
footman
alighted
and
rang
the
convent
bell
to
the
interested
curiosity
of
two
or
three
loungers
upon
the
steps
of
the
town
hall
over
the
way
yes
it
was
her
father
greyer
but
less
sad
of
visage
than
at
his
last
visit
his
doublet
and
cloak
were
handsomer
than
the
clothes
he
had
worn
then
though
they
were
still
of
the
same
fashion
that
english
mode
which
he
had
affected
before
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
and
which
he
had
never
changed
immediately
after
him
there
alighted
a
vision
of
beauty
the
loveliest
of
ladies
in
velvet
and
pale
grey
fur
and
with
a
long
white
feather
encircling
a
hat
and
a
collar
of
venetian
lace
veiling
a
bosom
that
scintillated
with
jewels
hyacinth
cried
angela
in
a
flutter
of
delight
the
portress
peered
at
the
visitors
through
her
and
being
satisfied
that
they
were
the
expected
guests
speedily
opened
the
door
there
was
no
one
to
interfere
between
father
and
daughter
sister
and
sister
in
the
convent
parlour
angela
had
her
dear
people
all
to
herself
the
mother
superior
respecting
the
confidences
and
outpourings
of
love
which
neither
father
nor
children
would
wish
to
be
witnessed
even
by
a
kinswoman
thus
by
a
rare
breach
of
conventual
discipline
angela
was
allowed
to
receive
her
guests
alone
the
opened
the
parlour
door
and
ushered
in
the
visitors
and
angela
ran
to
meet
her
father
and
fell
sobbing
upon
his
breast
her
face
hidden
against
his
velvet
doublet
her
arms
clasping
his
neck
what
mistress
hast
thou
so
watery
a
welcome
now
that
the
clouds
have
passed
away
and
every
loyal
english
heart
is
joyful
cried
sir
john
in
a
voice
that
was
somewhat
husky
but
with
a
great
show
of
gaiety
oh
sir
i
have
waited
so
long
so
long
for
this
day
sometimes
i
thought
it
would
never
come
that
i
should
never
see
my
dear
father
again
poor
child
it
would
have
been
only
my
desert
hadst
thou
forgotten
me
altogether
i
might
have
come
to
you
sooner
pretty
one
indeed
i
would
have
come
only
things
went
ill
with
me
i
was
and
hopeless
of
any
good
fortune
in
a
world
that
seemed
given
over
to
scoundrels
and
till
the
tide
turned
i
had
no
heart
to
come
nigh
you
but
now
fortunes
are
mended
the
king
and
mine
and
you
have
a
father
once
again
and
shall
have
a
home
the
house
where
you
were
born
and
where
your
made
my
life
blessed
you
are
like
her
angela
holding
back
the
pale
face
in
his
strong
hands
and
gazing
upon
it
earnestly
yes
you
favour
your
mother
but
your
face
is
over
sad
for
your
years
look
at
your
sister
here
would
you
not
say
a
sunbeam
had
taken
woman
shape
and
come
dancing
into
the
room
angela
looked
round
and
greeted
the
lady
who
had
stood
aside
while
father
and
daughter
met
yes
such
a
face
suggested
sunlight
and
summer
birds
butterflies
all
things
buoyant
and
gladsome
a
complexion
of
dazzling
fairness
pearly
transparent
with
carnations
eyes
of
heavenliest
blue
liquid
laughing
brimming
with
espi√©glerie
a
slim
little
nose
with
an
upward
tilt
which
expressed
a
contemptuous
gaiety
an
inquiring
curiosity
a
dimpled
chin
sloping
a
little
towards
the
full
round
throat
the
bust
and
shoulders
of
a
venus
the
waist
of
a
sylph
set
off
by
the
velvet
bodice
with
its
diamond
and
turquoise
buttons
hair
of
palest
gold
fluffed
out
into
curls
that
were
traps
for
sunbeams
hands
and
arms
of
a
milky
whiteness
emerging
from
the
large
loose
a
radiant
apparition
which
took
angela
by
surprise
she
had
seen
flemish
vraus
in
the
richest
attire
and
among
them
there
had
been
women
as
handsome
as
helena
forment
but
this
vision
of
a
fine
lady
from
the
court
of
the
roi
soleil
was
a
revelation
until
this
moment
the
girl
had
hardly
known
what
grace
and
beauty
meant
come
and
let
me
hug
you
my
dearest
puritan
cried
hyacinth
holding
out
her
arms
why
do
you
suffer
your
custodians
to
clothe
you
in
that
odious
grey
which
puts
me
in
mind
of
scum
and
all
their
hateful
works
i
would
have
you
sparkling
in
white
satin
and
silver
or
blushing
in
brocade
powdered
with
and
rosebuds
what
would
fareham
say
if
i
told
him
i
had
a
puritan
in
grey
woollen
stuff
for
my
sister
he
sends
you
his
love
dear
and
bids
me
tell
you
there
shall
be
always
an
honoured
place
in
our
home
for
you
be
it
in
england
or
france
in
town
or
country
and
why
should
you
not
fill
that
place
at
once
sister
your
education
is
finished
and
to
be
sure
you
must
be
tired
of
these
stone
walls
and
this
sleepy
town
no
hyacinth
i
love
the
convent
and
the
friends
who
have
made
it
my
home
you
and
lord
fareham
are
very
kind
but
i
could
not
leave
our
reverend
mother
she
is
not
so
well
or
so
strong
as
she
used
to
be
and
i
think
she
likes
to
have
me
with
her
because
though
she
loves
us
all
down
to
the
humblest
of
the
i
am
of
her
kin
and
seem
nearest
to
her
i
do
want
to
forsake
her
and
if
it
was
not
against
my
father
wish
i
should
like
to
end
my
days
in
this
house
and
to
give
my
thoughts
to
god
that
is
because
thou
knowest
nought
of
the
world
outside
sweetheart
protested
hyacinth
i
admire
the
readiness
with
which
folks
will
renounce
a
banquet
they
have
never
tasted
a
single
day
at
the
louvre
or
the
palais
royal
would
change
your
inclinations
at
once
and
for
ever
she
is
too
young
for
a
court
life
or
a
town
life
either
said
sir
john
and
i
have
no
mind
to
remove
her
from
this
safe
shelter
till
the
king
shall
be
firm
upon
his
throne
and
our
poor
country
shall
have
settled
into
a
stable
and
peaceful
condition
but
there
must
be
no
vows
angela
no
renunciation
of
kindred
and
home
i
look
to
thee
for
the
comfort
of
my
old
age
dear
father
i
will
never
disobey
you
i
shall
remember
always
that
my
first
duty
is
to
you
and
when
you
want
me
you
have
but
to
summon
me
and
whether
you
are
at
home
or
abroad
in
wealth
and
honour
or
in
exile
and
poverty
i
will
go
to
you
and
be
glad
and
happy
to
be
your
daughter
and
your
servant
i
knew
thou
wouldst
dearest
i
have
never
forgotten
how
the
soft
little
arms
clung
about
my
neck
and
how
the
baby
lips
kissed
me
in
this
same
parlour
when
my
heart
was
weighed
down
by
a
load
of
iron
and
there
seemed
no
ray
of
hope
for
england
or
me
you
were
my
comforter
then
and
you
will
be
my
comforter
in
the
days
to
come
hyacinth
here
is
of
the
butterfly
breed
she
is
fair
to
look
upon
and
tender
and
loving
but
she
is
ever
on
the
wing
and
she
has
her
husband
and
her
children
to
cherish
and
can
not
be
burdened
with
the
care
of
a
greybeard
why
you
are
as
brave
a
gallant
as
the
youngest
cavalier
in
the
king
service
cried
hyacinth
i
would
pit
my
father
against
montagu
or
buckingham
buckhurst
or
roscommon
against
the
gayest
the
boldest
of
them
all
on
land
or
sea
forsooth
we
will
hear
no
such
words
from
you
sir
for
a
score
of
years
and
now
you
will
want
all
your
wits
to
take
your
proper
place
at
court
as
sage
counsellor
and
friend
of
the
new
king
sure
he
will
need
his
father
friends
about
him
to
teach
him
he
who
has
led
such
a
gay
life
as
a
penniless
rover
with
scarce
a
sound
coat
to
his
back
nay
hyacinth
the
king
will
have
no
need
of
us
old
malignants
we
have
had
our
day
he
has
shrewd
ned
hyde
for
counsellor
and
in
that
one
long
head
there
is
craft
enough
to
govern
a
kingdom
the
new
court
will
be
a
young
court
and
the
fashion
of
it
will
be
new
we
old
fellows
who
were
gallant
and
gay
enough
in
the
forties
when
we
fought
against
essex
and
his
tawny
scarves
would
be
but
laughable
figures
at
the
court
of
a
young
man
bred
half
in
paris
and
steeped
in
french
fashions
and
french
follies
no
hyacinth
it
is
for
you
and
your
husband
the
new
day
dawns
if
i
get
back
to
my
old
meads
and
woods
and
the
house
where
i
was
born
i
will
sit
quietly
down
in
the
chimney
corner
and
take
to
and
a
pack
of
harriers
for
the
diversion
of
my
declining
years
and
when
my
angela
can
make
up
her
mind
to
leave
her
good
aunt
she
shall
keep
house
for
me
i
should
love
to
be
your
housekeeper
dearest
father
if
it
please
heaven
to
restore
my
aunt
to
health
and
strength
i
will
go
to
you
with
a
heart
full
of
joy
said
the
girl
hanging
caressingly
upon
the
old
shoulder
hyacinth
flitted
about
the
room
with
a
swift
birdlike
motion
looking
at
the
sacred
images
and
prints
the
over
the
mantelpiece
which
told
with
much
flourish
of
penmanship
the
progress
of
the
convent
pupils
in
learning
and
domestic
virtues
what
a
humdrum
dismal
room
she
cried
you
should
see
our
convent
parlours
in
paris
at
the
carmelites
in
the
rue
saint
jacques
the
favourite
convent
and
at
chaillot
the
house
founded
by
queen
henrietta
such
pictures
and
ornaments
and
embroidered
hangings
and
tapestries
worked
by
devotees
this
room
of
yours
sister
stinks
of
poverty
as
your
flemish
streets
stink
of
garlic
and
cabbage
faugh
i
know
not
which
is
worse
having
thus
delivered
herself
of
her
disgust
she
darted
upon
her
younger
sister
laid
her
hands
upon
the
girl
shoulders
and
contemplated
her
with
mock
seriousness
what
a
precocious
young
saint
thou
art
with
no
more
interest
in
the
world
outside
this
naked
parlour
than
if
thou
wert
yonder
image
of
the
holy
mother
not
a
question
of
my
husband
or
my
children
or
of
the
last
fashion
in
hood
and
mantle
or
of
the
new
laced
gloves
or
the
french
king
latest
divinity
i
should
dearly
like
to
see
your
children
hyacinth
answered
her
sister
ah
they
are
the
most
enchanting
creatures
the
girl
a
perpetual
sunbeam
ethereal
elfish
a
being
of
life
and
movement
and
with
a
loquacity
that
never
tires
the
boy
a
lump
of
honey
fat
sleek
lazily
beautiful
i
am
never
tired
of
admiring
them
when
i
have
time
to
see
them
papillon
an
old
friend
of
mine
has
surnamed
her
papillon
because
she
is
never
still
was
five
years
old
on
march
we
were
at
germain
on
her
birthday
you
should
have
seen
the
toys
and
trinkets
and
sweetmeats
which
the
court
showered
upon
her
the
king
and
queen
monsieur
mademoiselle
the
princess
henrietta
her
godmother
everybody
had
a
gift
for
the
daughter
of
la
folle
baronne
fareham
yes
they
are
lovely
creatures
angela
and
i
am
miserable
to
think
that
it
may
be
half
a
year
before
i
see
their
sweet
faces
again
why
so
long
sister
because
they
are
at
the
ch√¢teau
de
montrond
grandmother
place
near
dieppe
and
because
fareham
and
i
are
going
hence
to
breda
to
meet
the
king
our
own
king
charles
and
help
lead
him
home
in
triumph
in
london
the
mob
are
shouting
roaring
singing
for
their
king
and
montagu
fleet
lies
in
the
downs
waiting
but
the
signal
from
parliament
to
cross
to
holland
he
who
left
his
country
in
a
scurvy
will
go
back
to
england
in
a
mighty
the
mark
you
the
christened
by
that
usurper
in
insolent
remembrance
of
a
rebel
victory
but
charles
will
doubtless
change
that
hated
name
he
must
not
be
put
in
mind
of
a
fight
where
rebels
had
the
better
of
loyal
gentlemen
he
will
sail
home
over
those
dancing
seas
with
a
fleet
of
great
ships
circling
round
him
like
a
flight
of
silvery
doves
oh
what
a
turn
of
fortune
wheel
i
am
wild
with
rapture
at
the
thought
of
it
you
love
england
better
than
france
though
you
must
be
almost
a
stranger
there
said
angela
wonderingly
looking
at
a
miniature
which
her
sister
wore
in
a
bracelet
nay
love
is
in
paris
i
am
an
insignificant
alien
though
they
are
ever
so
kind
and
flattering
to
me
at
st
germain
i
was
only
madame
de
the
wife
of
a
somewhat
morose
gentleman
who
was
cleverer
at
winning
battles
than
at
gaining
hearts
at
whitehall
i
shall
be
lady
fareham
and
shall
enjoy
my
full
consequence
as
the
wife
of
an
english
nobleman
of
ancient
lineage
and
fine
estate
for
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
his
lordship
property
suffered
less
than
most
people
in
the
rebellion
and
anything
his
father
lost
when
he
fought
for
the
good
cause
will
be
given
back
to
the
son
now
the
good
cause
is
triumphant
with
additions
perhaps
an
earl
coronet
instead
of
a
baron
beggarly
pearls
i
should
like
papillon
to
be
lady
henrietta
and
you
will
send
for
your
children
doubtless
when
you
are
sure
all
is
safe
in
england
said
angela
still
contemplating
the
portrait
in
the
bracelet
which
her
sister
had
unclasped
while
she
talked
this
is
papillon
i
know
what
a
sweet
kind
mischievous
face
mischievous
as
a
barbary
ape
kind
and
sweet
as
the
west
wind
said
sir
john
and
your
boy
asked
angela
reclasping
the
bracelet
on
the
fair
round
arm
having
looked
her
fill
at
the
mutinous
eyes
the
brown
crisply
curling
hair
dainty
pointed
chin
and
dimpled
cheeks
have
you
his
picture
too
not
his
but
i
wear
his
father
likeness
somewhere
betwixt
buckram
and
flanders
lace
answered
hyacinth
gaily
pulling
a
locket
from
amidst
the
splendours
of
her
corsage
i
call
it
next
my
heart
but
there
is
a
stout
fortification
of
whalebone
between
heart
and
picture
you
have
gloated
enough
on
the
daughter
impertinent
visage
look
now
at
the
father
whom
she
resembles
in
little
as
a
kitten
resembles
a
tiger
she
handed
her
sister
an
oval
locket
bordered
with
diamonds
and
held
by
a
slender
indian
chain
and
angela
saw
the
face
of
the
whose
kindness
and
hospitality
had
been
so
freely
promised
to
her
she
explored
the
countenance
long
and
earnestly
well
do
you
think
i
chose
him
for
his
beauty
asked
hyacinth
you
have
devoured
every
lineament
with
that
serious
gaze
of
yours
as
if
you
were
trying
to
read
the
spirit
behind
that
mask
of
flesh
do
you
think
him
handsome
angela
faltered
but
was
unskilled
in
flattery
and
could
not
reply
with
a
compliment
no
sister
surely
none
have
ever
called
this
countenance
handsome
but
it
is
a
face
to
set
one
thinking
ay
child
and
he
who
owns
the
face
is
a
man
to
set
one
thinking
he
has
made
me
think
many
a
time
when
i
would
have
travelled
a
day
journey
to
escape
the
thoughts
he
forced
upon
me
he
was
not
made
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
life
he
is
a
stormy
petrel
it
was
for
his
ugliness
i
chose
him
those
dark
stern
features
that
imperious
mouth
and
a
brow
like
the
olympian
jove
he
scared
me
into
loving
him
i
sheltered
myself
upon
his
breast
from
the
thunder
of
his
brow
the
lightning
of
his
eye
he
has
a
look
of
his
cousin
wentworth
said
sir
john
i
never
see
him
but
i
think
of
that
murdered
man
my
father
friend
and
mine
whom
i
have
never
ceased
to
mourn
yet
their
kin
is
of
the
most
distant
said
hyacinth
it
is
strange
that
there
should
be
any
likeness
faces
appear
and
reappear
in
families
answered
her
father
you
may
observe
that
curiously
recurring
likeness
in
any
if
the
family
portraits
cover
a
century
or
two
louis
has
little
in
common
with
his
grandfather
but
two
hundred
years
hence
there
may
be
a
prince
of
the
royal
house
whose
every
feature
shall
recall
henry
the
great
the
portrait
was
returned
to
its
under
perfumed
lace
and
cobweb
lawn
and
the
reverend
mother
entered
the
parlour
ready
for
conversation
and
eager
to
hear
the
history
of
the
last
six
weeks
of
the
collapse
of
that
military
despotism
which
had
convulsed
england
and
dominated
europe
and
was
now
melting
into
thin
air
as
ghosts
dissolve
at
of
the
secret
negotiations
between
monk
and
grenville
now
known
to
everybody
of
the
king
gracious
amnesty
and
promise
of
universal
pardon
save
for
some
score
or
so
of
conspicuous
villains
whose
hands
were
dyed
with
the
royal
martyr
blood
she
was
full
of
questioning
and
above
all
eager
to
know
whether
it
was
true
that
king
charles
was
at
heart
as
staunch
a
papist
as
his
brother
the
duke
of
york
was
believed
to
be
though
even
the
duke
lacked
the
courage
to
bear
witness
to
the
true
faith
two
brought
in
a
repast
of
cakes
and
syrups
and
light
wines
such
delicate
and
dainty
food
as
the
pious
ladies
of
the
convent
were
especially
skilled
in
preparing
and
which
they
deemed
for
the
entertainment
of
company
even
when
one
of
their
guests
was
a
rugged
soldier
like
sir
john
kirkland
when
the
light
collation
had
been
tasted
and
praised
the
coach
came
to
the
door
again
and
swallowed
up
the
beautiful
lady
and
the
old
cavalier
who
vanished
from
angela

in
a
cloud
of
dust
waving
hands
from
the

window
chapter

letters
from
home
the
quiet
days
went
by
and
grew
into
years
and
time
was
only
marked
by
the
gradual
failure
of
the
reverend
mother
health
so
gradual
so
gentle
a
decay
that
it
was
only
when
looking
back
on
sylvester
eve
that
her
became
aware
how
much
of
strength
and
activity
had
been
lost
since
the
superior
knelt
in
her
place
near
the
altar
listening
to
the
solemn
music
of
the
midnight
mass
that
sanctified
the
passing
of
the
year
this
year
the
reverend
mother
was
led
to
her
seat
between
two
nuns
who
sustained
her
feeble
limbs
this
year
the
meek
knees
which
had
worn
the
marble
floor
in
long
hours
of
prayer
during
eighty
pious
years
could
no
longer
bend
the
meek
head
was
bowed
the
bloodless
hands
were
lifted
up
in
supplication
but
the
fingers
were
wasted
and
stiffened
and
there
was
pain
in
every
movement
of
the
joints
there
was
no
actual
malady
only
the
slow
death
in
life
called
old
age
all
the
patient
needed
was
rest
and
tender
nursing
this
last
her
supplied
together
with
the
gentlest
companionship
no
highly
trained
nurse
the
product
of
modern
science
could
have
been
more
efficient
than
the
instinct
of
affection
had
made
angela
and
then
the
patient
temper
was
so
amiable
her
mind
undimmed
after
years
of
life
was
a
mirror
of
god
she
thought
of
her
with
a
divine
charity
she
worshipped
her
creator
with
an
implicit
faith
for
her
in
many
a
waking
vision
the
heavens
opened
and
the
spirits
of
departed
saints
descended
from
their
abode
in
bliss
to
hold
converse
with
her
eighty
years
of
her
life
had
been
given
to
religious
exercises
and
charitable
deeds
motherless
before
she
could
speak
she
had
entered
the
convent
as
a
pupil
at
three
years
of
age
and
had
taken
the
veil
at
seventeen
her
father
had
married
a
great
heiress
whose
only
child
a
daughter
was
allowed
to
absorb
all
the
small
stock
of
parental
affection
and
there
was
no
one
to
dispute
anastasia
desire
for
the
cloister
all
she
knew
of
the
world
outside
those
walls
was
from
hearsay
a
rare
visit
from
her
lovely
the
marquise
de
montrond
had
astonished
her
with
the
sight
of
a
distinguished
parisienne
and
left
her
wondering
she
had
never
read
a
secular
book
she
knew
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
pleasure
save
in
the
mild
amusements
permitted
to
the
convent
children
till
they
left
the
convent
as
young
women
on
the
evening
of
a
saint
day
a
stately
dance
of
curtsyings
and
waving
arms
a
little
childish
play
dramatising
some
incident
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
so
she
lived
her
eighty
years
of
obedience
and
quiet
usefulness
learning
and
teaching
serving
and
governing
she
had
lived
through
the
thirty
years
war
through
the
devastations
of
wallenstein
the
cruelties
of
bavarian
tilly
the
judicial
murder
of
egmont
and
horn
she
had
heard
of
villages
burnt
populations
put
to
the
sword
women
and
children
killed
by
thousands
she
had
conversed
with
those
who
remembered
the
league
she
had
seen
the
nuns
weeping
for
edward
campion
cruel
fate
she
had
heard
masses
sung
for
the
soul
of
murdered
mary
stuart
she
had
heard
of
raleigh
visions
of
conquest
and
of
gold
setting
his
face
towards
the
west
in
the
afternoon
of
life
to
encounter
bereavement
treachery
sickening
failure
and
go
back
to
his
native
england
to
expiate
the
dreams
of
genius
with
the
blood
of
a
martyr
and
through
all
the
changes
and
chances
of
that
eventful
century
she
had
lived
apart
full
of
pity
and
wonder
in
a
charmed
circle
of
piety
and
love
her
room
in
these
peaceful
stages
of
the
closing
scene
was
a
haven
of
rest
angela
loved
the
seclusion
of
the
panelled
chamber
with
its
heavily
mullioned
casement
facing
the
and
the
polished
oak
floor
on
which
the
red
and
gold
of
the
sunset
were
mirrored
as
on
the
dark
stillness
of
a
moorland
tarn
for
her
every
object
in
the
room
had
its
interest
or
its
charm
the
associations
of
childhood
hallowed
them
all
the
large
ivory
crucifix
yellow
with
age
dim
with
the
kisses
of
adoring
lips
the
delf
statuettes
of
mary
and
joseph
flaming
with
gaudy
colour
the
figure
of
the
saviour
and
john
the
baptist
delicately
carved
out
of
boxwood
in
a
group
representing
the
baptism
in
the
river
jordan
the
holy
dove
trembling
on
a
wire
over
the
divine
head
the
books
the
pictures
the
rosaries
all
these
she
had
gazed
at
reverently
when
all
things
were
new
and
the
convent
passages
places
of
shuddering
and
the
service
of
the
mass
an
unintelligible
mystery
she
had
grown
up
within
those
solemn
walls
and
now
seeing
her
kinswoman
life
gently
ebbing
away
she
could
but
wonder
what
she
would
have
to
do
in
this
world
when
another
took
the
place
and
the
tie
that
bound
her
to
louvain
would
be
broken
the
lady
who
would
in
all
probability
succeed
mother
anastasia
as
superior
was
a
clever
domineering
woman
whom
angela
loved
least
of
all
the
nuns
a
widow
of
good
birth
and
fortune
and
a
thorough
fleming
stolid
bigoted
prejudiced
and
taking
much
credit
to
herself
for
the
wealth
she
had
brought
to
the
convent
apt
to
talk
of
the
and
the
chapel
her
money
had
helped
to
build
and
restore
as
my
or
my
chapel
no
angela
had
no
desire
to
remain
in
the
convent
when
her
dear
kinswoman
should
have
vanished
from
the
scene
her
presence
sanctified
the
house
would
be
haunted
with
sorrowful
memories
it
would
be
time
for
her
to
claim
that
home
which
her
father
had
talked
of
sharing
with
her
in
his
old
age
she
could
just
faintly
remember
the
house
in
which
she
was
born
the
moat
the
the
thick
walls
of
yew
the
peacocks
and
lions
cut
in
box
of
which
the
gardener
who
clipped
them
was
so
proud
faintly
faintly
the
picture
of
the
old
house
came
back
to
her
built
of
grey
stone
and
stained
with
moss
grave
and
substantial
occupying
three
sides
of
a
quadrangle
a
house
of
many
windows
few
of
which
were
intended
to
open
a
house
of
dark
passages
like
these
in
the
convent
and
flights
of
shallow
steps
and
curious
turns
and
twistings
here
and
there
there
were
living
birds
that
sunned
their
spreading
tails
and
stalked
in
slow
stateliness
on
the
turf
terraces
as
well
as
those
peacocks
clipped
out
of
yew
the
house
lay
in
a
buckinghamshire
valley
shut
round
and
sheltered
by
hills
and
coppices
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
game
angela
had
seen
the
low
larder
hung
with
pheasants
and
hares
her
heart
yearned
towards
the
old
house
so
distinctly
pictured
by
memory
though
perchance
with
some
differences
from
the
actual
scene
the
mansion
would
seem
smaller
to
her
doubtless
beholding
it
with
the
eyes
of
womanhood
than
childish
memory
made
it
but
to
live
there
with
her
father
to
wait
upon
him
and
tend
him
to
have
hyacinth
children
there
playing
in
the
gardens
as
she
had
played
would
be
as
happy
a
life
as
her
fancy
could
compass
all
that
she
knew
of
the
march
of
events
during
those
tranquil
years
in
the
convent
came
to
her
in
letters
from
her
sister
who
was
a
vivacious
and
prided
herself
upon
her
epistolary
talent
as
indeed
upon
her
general
superiority
from
a
literary
standpoint
to
the
women
of
her
day
it
was
a
pleasure
to
lady
fareham
in
some
rare
interval
of
solitude
when
the
weather
was
too
severe
for
her
to
venture
outside
the
hall
door
even
in
her
comfortable
coach
and
when
by
some
curious
concatenation
she
happened
to
be
without
visitors
to
open
her
portfolio
and
prattle
with
her
pen
to
her
sister
as
she
would
have
prattled
with
her
tongue
to
the
visitors
whom
snow
or
tempest
kept
away
her
letters
written
from
london
were
apt
to
be
rare
and
brief
angela
noted
but
from
his
mansion
near
oxford
or
at
the
grange
between
fareham
and
winchester
once
the
property
of
the
brothers
of
cross
she
always
sent
a
budget
few
of
these
lengthy
epistles
contained
anything
bearing
upon
angela
own
existence
except
the
entreaty
that
she
would
make
haste
and
join
them
or
even
the
flippant
suggestion
that
mother
anastasia
should
make
haste
and
die
they
were
of
the
nature
of
but
the
news
was
tinctured
by
the
feminine
medium
through
which
it
came
and
there
was
a
flavour
of
egotism
in
almost
every
page
lady
fareham
wrote
as
only
a
pretty
woman
courted
flattered
and
indulged
by
everybody
about
her
ever
since
she
could
remember
could
be
forgiven
for
writing
people
had
petted
her
and
worshipped
her
with
such
uniform
subservience
that
she
had
grown
to
thirty
years
of
age
without
knowing
that
she
was
selfish
accepting
homage
and
submission
as
a
law
of
the
universe
as
kings
and
princes
do
only
in
one
of
those
letters
was
there
that
which
might
be
called
a
momentous
fact
but
which
angela
took
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
mere
detail
to
be
dismissed
from
her
thoughts
when
the
letter
had
been
laid
aside
it
was
a
letter
with
a
black
seal
announcing
the
death
of
the
marquise
de
montrond
who
had
expired
of
an
apoplexy
at
her
house
in
the
marais
after
a
supper
party
at
which
mademoiselle
madame
de
longueville
madame
de
montausier
the
duchesse
de
bouillon
lauzun
evremond
cheery
little
godeau
bishop
of
vence
and
half
a
dozen
other
famous
wits
had
been
present
a
supper
bristling
with
royal
personages
death
had
come
with
appalling
suddenness
while
the
lamps
of
the
festival
were
burning
and
the
cards
were
still
upon
the
tables
and
the
last
carriage
had
but
just
rolled
under
the
it
is
the
manner
of
death
she
would
have
chosen
wrote
hyacinth
she
never
missed
confession
on
the
first
sunday
of
the
month
and
she
was
so
generous
to
the
church
and
to
the
poor
that
her
director
declared
she
would
have
been
too
saintly
for
earth
but
for
the
human
weakness
of
liking
fine
company
and
now
dearest
i
have
to
tell
you
how
she
has
disposed
of
her
fortune
and
i
hope
if
you
should
think
she
has
not
used
you
generously
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
i
have
neither
courted
her
for
her
wealth
nor
influenced
her
to
my
dear
sister
disadvantage
you
will
consider
that
i
was
with
her
from
my
eighth
year
until
the
other
day
when
fareham
brought
me
to
england
she
loved
me
passionately
in
my
childhood
and
has
often
told
me
since
that
she
never
felt
towards
me
as
a
grandmother
but
as
if
she
had
been
actually
my
mother
being
indeed
still
a
young
woman
when
she
adopted
me
and
by
strangers
always
mistaken
for
my
mother
she
was
handsome
to
the
last
and
young
in
mind
and
in
habits
long
after
youth
had
left
her
i
was
said
to
be
the
image
of
what
she
was
when
she
rivalled
madame
de
hautefort
in
the
affections
of
the
late
king
you
must
consider
sweetheart
that
he
was
the
most
moral
of
men
and
that
with
him
love
meant
a
passion
as
free
from
sensual
taint
as
the
preferences
of
a
sylph
i
think
my
good
grandmother
loved
me
all
the
better
for
this
fancied
resemblance
she
would
arrange
her
jewels
about
my
hair
and
bosom
as
she
had
worn
them
when
buckingham
came
wooing
for
his
master
and
then
she
would
bid
her
page
hold
a
mirror
before
me
and
tell
me
to
look
at
the
face
of
which
queen
anne
had
been
jealous
and
for
which
cinq
mars
had
run
mad
and
then
she
would
shed
a
tear
or
two
over
the
years
and
the
charms
that
were
gone
till
i
brought
the
cards
and
cheered
her
spirits
with
her
favourite
game
of
primero
she
had
her
fits
of
temper
and
little
tantrums
sometimes
ange
and
it
needed
some
patience
to
restrain
one
tongue
from
insolence
but
i
am
happy
to
remember
that
i
ever
bore
her
in
profound
respect
and
that
i
never
made
her
seriously
angry
but
once
which
was
when
i
being
then
almost
a
child
went
out
into
the
streets
of
paris
with
henri
de
malfort
and
a
wild
party
masked
to
hear
beaufort
address
the
populace
in
the
and
when
i
was
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
the
emerald
cross
given
her
by
the
great
cardinal
for
whom
i
believe
she
had
a
sneaking
kindness
why
else
should
she
have
so
hated
his
eminence
very
much
favoured
niece
madame
de
combalet
but
to
return
to
that
which
concerns
my
dear
sister
regarding
me
as
her
own
daughter
the
marquise
has
lavished
her
bounties
upon
me
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
my
own
sweet
angela
in
a
word
dearest
she
leaves
you
a
modest
income
of
four
hundred
louis
or
about
three
hundred
pounds
sterling
the
rental
of
two
farms
in
normandy
and
all
the
rest
of
her
fortune
she
bequeaths
to
me
and
papillon
after
me
including
her
house
in
the
marais
sadly
out
of
fashion
now
that
everybody
of
consequence
is
moving
to
the
place
royale
and
her
ch√¢teau
near
dieppe
besides
all
her
jewels
many
of
which
i
have
had
in
my
possession
ever
since
my
marriage
my
sweet
sister
shall
take
her
choice
of
a
carcanet
among
those
trinkets
and
now
dearest
if
you
are
left
with
a
pittance
that
will
but
serve
to
pay
for
your
gloves
and
fans
at
the
middle
exchange
and
perhaps
to
buy
you
an
indian
in
the
course
of
the
year
for
your
court
petticoats
and
mantuas
will
cost
three
times
as
much
you
have
but
to
remember
that
my
purse
is
to
be
yours
and
my
home
yours
and
that
fareham
and
i
do
but
wait
to
welcome
you
either
to
fareham
house
in
the
strand
or
to
chiltern
abbey
near
oxford
the
grange
near
fareham
i
never
intend
to
if
i
can
help
it
the
place
is
a
warren
of
rats
which
the
servants
take
for
ghosts
if
you
love
water
you
will
love
our
houses
for
the
river
runs
near
them
both
indeed
when
in
london
we
almost
think
ourselves
in
venice
save
that
we
have
a
spacious
garden
which
i
am
told
few
of
the
venetians
can
command
their
city
being
built
upon
an
assemblage
of
minuscule
islets
linked
together
by
innumerable
bridges
angela
smiled
as
she
looked
down
at
her
black
gown
the
uniform
of
the
convent
school
exchanged
for
a
somewhat
superior
grey
stuff
on
sundays
and
holidays
smiled
at
the
notion
of
spending
the
rent
of
two
farms
upon
her
toilet
and
how
much
more
ridiculous
seemed
the
assertion
that
to
appear
at
king
charles
court
she
must
spend
thrice
as
much
yet
she
could
but
remember
that
hyacinth
had
described
trains
and
petticoats
so
loaded
with
jewelled
embroidery
that
it
was
a
penance
to
wear
them
lace
worth
hundreds
of
pounds
plumed
hats
that
cost
as
much
as
a
year
maintenance
in
the
convent
mother
anastasia
expressed
considerable
displeasure
at
madame
de
disposal
of
her
wealth
this
is
what
it
is
to
live
in
a
court
and
to
care
only
for
earthly
things
she
said
all
sense
of
justice
is
lost
in
that
world
of
vanity
and
you
are
as
near
akin
to
the
marquise
as
your
sister
and
yet
because
she
was
familiar
with
the
one
and
not
with
the
other
and
because
her
vain
foolish
soul
took
pleasure
in
a
beauty
that
recalled
her
own
perishable
charms
she
leaves
one
sister
a
great
fortune
and
the
other
a
pittance
dear
aunt
i
am
more
than
content
but
i
am
not
content
for
you
angela
had
the
estate
been
divided
equally
you
might
have
taken
the
veil
and
succeeded
to
my
place
in
this
beloved
house
which
needs
the
accession
of
wealth
to
maintain
it
in
usefulness
and
dignity
angela
would
not
wound
her
aunt
feelings
by
one
word
of
disparagement
of
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
reared
but
looking
along
the
dim
avenue
of
the
future
she
yearned
for
some
wider
horizon
than
the
sky
barred
with
tall
poplars
which
rose
high
above
the
garden
wall
that
formed
the
limit
of
her
daily
walks
her
rambles
her
recreations
had
all
been
confined
within
that
space
of
seven
or
eight
acres
and
she
thought
sometimes
with
a
sudden
longing
of
those
hills
and
valleys
of
fertile
buckinghamshire
which
lay
so
far
back
in
the
dawn
of
her
mind
and
were
yet
so
distinctly
pictured
in
her
memory
and
london
that
wonderful
city
of
which
her
sister
wrote
in
such
glowing
words
the
long
range
of
palaces
beside
the
river
wider
than
the
seine
where
it
reflects
the
gloomy
bulk
of
the
louvre
and
the
temple
were
it
only
once
in
her
life
she
would
like
to
see
london
the
king
the
two
queens
whitehall
and
somerset
house
she
would
like
to
see
all
the
splendour
of
court
and
city
and
then
to
taste
the
placid
retirement
of
the
house
in
the
valley
and
to
be
her
father
housekeeper
and
companion
another
letter
from
hyacinth
announced
the
death
of
mazarin
the
cardinal
is
no
more
he
died
in
the
day
of
success
having
got
the
better
of
all
his
enemies
a
violent
access
of
gout
was
followed
by
an
affection
of
the
chest
which
proved
fatal
his
was
crowded
with
courtiers
and
sycophants
and
he
was
selling
sinecures
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
fareham
says
his
was
like
a
counter
he
was
passionately
fond
of
hocca
the
italian
game
which
he
brought
into
fashion
and
which
ruined
half
the
young
men
about
the
court
the
counterpane
was
scattered
with
money
and
playing
cards
which
were
only
brushed
aside
to
make
room
for
the
last
sacraments
my
lord
clarendon
declares
that
his
spirits
never
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
restoration
which
falsified
all
his
calculations
he
might
have
made
his
favourite
niece
queen
of
england
but
his
italian
caution
restrained
him
and
the
beautiful
hortense
has
to
put
up
with
a
duke
a
title
bought
with
her
uncle
money
to
whom
the
cardinal
affianced
her
on
his
he
was
a
remarkable
man
and
so
profound
a
dissembler
that
his
pretended
opposition
to
king
louis
marriage
with
his
niece
olympe
mancini
would
have
deceived
the
shrewdest
observer
had
we
not
all
known
that
he
ardently
desired
the
union
and
that
it
was
only
his
fear
of
queen
anger
which
prevented
it
her
spanish
pride
was
in
arms
at
the
notion
and
she
would
not
have
stopped
short
at
revolution
to
prevent
or
to
revenge
such
an
alliance
this
was
perhaps
the
only
occasion
upon
which
she
ever
seriously
opposed
mazarin
with
him
expires
all
her
political
power
she
is
now
as
much
a
cypher
as
in
the
time
of
the
late
king
when
france
had
only
one
master
the
great
cardinal
he
who
is
just
dead
fareham
says
was
but
a
little
richelieu
and
he
recalls
how
when
the
great
cardinal
died
people
scarce
dared
tell
one
another
of
his
death
so
profound
was
the
awe
in
which
he
was
held
he
left
the
king
a
nullity
and
the
queen
all
powerful
she
was
young
and
beautiful
then
you
see
her
husband
was
marked
for
death
her
son
was
an
infant
all
france
was
hers
a
kingdom
of
courtiers
and
flatterers
and
now
she
is
old
and
ailing
and
mazarin
being
gone
the
young
king
will
submit
to
no
minister
who
claims
to
be
anything
better
than
a
clerk
or
a
secretary
colbert
he
must
tolerate
for
colbert
means
prosperity
but
colbert
will
have
to
obey
my
friend
the
duchesse
de
longueville
who
is
now
living
in
strict
retirement
writes
me
the
most
exquisite
letters
and
from
her
i
hear
all
that
happens
in
that
country
which
i
sometimes
fancy
is
more
my
own
than
the
duller
climate
where
my
lot
is
now
cast
fifteen
years
at
the
french
court
have
made
me
in
heart
and
mind
almost
a
frenchwoman
nor
can
i
fail
to
be
influenced
by
my
maternal
ancestry
i
find
it
difficult
sometimes
to
remember
my
english
when
conversing
with
the
of
oxfordshire
who
have
no
french
yet
insist
for
finery
sake
upon
larding
their
rustic
english
with
french
words
all
that
is
most
agreeable
in
our
court
is
imitated
from
the
palais
royal
and
the
louvre
is
but
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
says
fareham
in
one
of
his
philosophy
fits
preaching
upon
the
changes
he
has
seen
in
paris
and
london
and
indeed
it
is
strange
to
have
lived
through
two
revolutions
one
so
awful
in
its
final
catastrophe
that
it
dwarfs
the
other
yet
both
terrible
for
i
who
was
a
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
princes
and
princesses
during
the
two
wars
of
the
fronde
am
not
inclined
to
think
lightly
of
a
civil
war
which
cost
france
some
of
the
flower
of
her
nobility
and
made
her
greatest
hero
a
prisoner
and
an
exile
for
seven
years
of
his
life
but
oh
my
dear
it
was
a
romantic
time
and
i
look
back
and
am
proud
to
have
lived
in
it
i
was
but
twelve
years
old
at
the
siege
of
paris
but
i
was
in
madame
de
longueville
room
at
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
while
the
fighting
was
going
on
and
the
officers
in
their
steel
cuirasses
coming
in
from
the
thick
of
the
strife
such
a
confusion
of
fine
ladies
and
armed
men
and
blue
scarves
fiddles
squeaking
in
the
salon
trumpets
sounding
in
the
square
below
in
a
letter
of
later
date
lady
fareham
expatiated
upon
the
folly
of
her
sister
spiritual
guides
i
am
desolated
by
the
absurd
restriction
which
forbids
you
to
profit
by
my
new
year
gift
i
thought
when
i
sent
you
all
the
volumes
of
la
scud√®ry
enchanting
romance
i
had
laid
up
for
you
a
year
of
enjoyment
and
that
touched
by
the
baguette
of
that
exquisite
fancy
your
convent
walls
would
fall
like
those
of
jericho
at
the
sound
of
jewish
trumpets
and
you
would
be
transported
in
imagination
to
the
finest
society
in
the
world
the
company
of
cyrus
and
mandane
under
which
oriental
disguise
you
are
shown
every
feature
of
mind
and
person
in
cond√©
and
his
heroic
sister
my
esteemed
friend
the
duchesse
de
longueville
as
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
appreciate
mademoiselle
scud√®ry
genius
and
to
detect
behind
the
name
of
the
brother
the
tender
sentiments
and
delicate
refinement
of
the
sister
chaster
pen
so
i
believe
i
was
the
first
to
call
the
duchesse
a
sobriquet
which
soon
became
general
among
her
intimates
you
are
not
to
read
grand
cyrus
your
aunt
tells
you
because
it
is
a
romance
that
is
to
say
you
are
forbidden
to
peruse
the
most
faithful
history
of
your
own
time
and
to
familiarise
yourself
with
the
persons
and
minds
of
great
people
whom
you
may
never
be
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
in
the
flesh
i
myself
dearest
ange
have
had
the
felicity
to
live
among
these
princely
persons
to
revel
in
the
conversations
of
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
not
perhaps
as
our
grandmother
would
have
told
you
in
its
most
glorious
period
but
at
least
while
it
was
still
the
focus
of
all
that
is
choicest
in
letters
and
in
art
did
we
not
hear
poquelin
read
his
first
comedy
before
it
was
represented
by
monsieur
company
in
the
beautiful
theatre
at
the
palais
royal
built
by
richelieu
when
it
was
the
palais
cardinal
not
read
grand
cyrus
and
on
the
score
of
morality
why
this
most
delightful
book
was
written
by
one
of
the
most
moral
women
in
paris
one
of
the
chastest
against
whose
reputation
no
word
of
slander
has
ever
been
breathed
it
must
indeed
be
confessed
that
sapho
is
of
an
ugliness
which
would
protect
her
even
were
she
not
guarded
by
the
aegis
of
genius
she
is
one
of
those
fortunate
unfortunates
who
can
walk
through
the
furnace
of
a
court
unscathed
and
leave
a
reputation
for
modesty
in
an
age
that
scarce
credits
virtue
in
woman
i
fear
dear
child
that
these
restrictions
of
your
convent
will
leave
you
of
a
surpassing
ignorance
which
may
cover
you
with
confusion
when
you
find
yourself
in
fine
company
there
are
accomplishments
without
which
youth
is
no
more
admired
than
age
and
grey
hairs
and
to
sparkle
with
wit
or
astonish
with
learning
is
a
necessity
for
a
woman
of
quality
it
is
only
by
the
advantages
of
education
that
we
can
show
ourselves
superior
to
such
a
hussy
as
albemarle
duchess
who
was
the
faithless
wife
of
a
sailor
or
barber
i
forget
which
and
who
hangs
like
a
millstone
upon
the
general
neck
now
that
he
has
climbed
to
the
zenith
to
have
perfect
italian
and
some
spanish
is
as
needful
as
to
have
fine
eyes
and
complexion
nowadays
and
to
dance
admirably
is
a
gift
indispensable
to
a
lady
alas
i
fear
that
those
little
feet
of
yours
i
hope
they
small
have
never
been
taught
to
move
in
a
coranto
or
a
and
that
you
will
have
to
learn
the
alphabet
of
dancing
at
an
age
when
most
women
are
finished
performers
the
great
cond√©
while
winning
sieges
and
battles
that
surpassed
the
feats
of
greeks
and
romans
contrived
to
make
himself
the
finest
dancer
of
his
day
and
won
more
admiration
in
circles
by
his
graceful
movements
which
every
one
could
understand
and
admire
than
by
prodigies
of
valour
at
dunkirk
or
nordlingen
the
above
was
one
of
lady
fareham
most
serious
letters
her
pen
was
exercised
for
the
most
part
in
a
lighter
vein
she
wrote
of
the
court
beauties
the
court
jests
practical
jokes
some
of
them
which
our
finer
minds
of
would
consider
in
execrable
taste
such
jests
as
we
read
of
in
grammont
memoirs
which
generally
aimed
at
making
an
ugly
woman
ridiculous
or
an
injured
husband
the
sport
and
victim
of
wicked
lover
and
heartless
wife
no
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
constrained
her
ladyship
from
communicating
these
court
scandals
to
her
guileless
sister
did
they
not
comprise
the
only
news
worth
anybody
attention
and
relate
to
the
only
class
of
people
who
had
any
tangible
existence
for
lady
fareham
there
were
millions
of
human
beings
no
doubt
living
and
acting
and
suffering
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
outside
the
stellary
circles
of
which
louis
and
charles
were
the
suns
but
there
was
no
interstellar
medium
of
sympathy
to
convey
the
idea
of
those
exterior
populations
to
hyacinth
mind
she
knew
of
the
populace
french
or
english
as
of
something
which
was
occasionally
given
to
become
dangerous
and
revolutionary
which
sometimes
starved
and
sometimes
died
of
the
plague
and
was
always
unpleasing
to
the
educated
eye
masquerades
plays
races
at
newmarket
dances
duels
losses
at
cards
lady
fareham
touched
every
subject
and
expatiated
on
all
but
she
had
usually
more
to
tell
of
the
country
she
had
left
than
of
that
in
which
she
was
living
here
everything
is
on
such
a
small
scale
mesquin
she
wrote
whitehall
covers
a
large
area
but
it
is
only
a
fine
banqueting
hall
and
a
labyrinth
of
lodgings
without
suite
or
stateliness
the
pictures
in
the
late
king
cabinet
are
said
to
be
the
finest
in
the
world
but
they
are
a
kind
of
pieces
for
which
i
care
very
little
flemish
and
dutch
chiefly
with
a
series
of
cartoons
by
raphael
which
connoisseurs
affect
to
admire
but
which
did
they
belong
to
me
i
would
gladly
exchange
for
a
set
of
mortlake
tapestries
his
majesty
here
builds
ships
while
the
king
of
france
builds
palaces
i
am
told
louis
is
spending
millions
on
the
new
palace
at
versailles
an
ungrateful
site
no
water
no
noble
prospect
as
at
germain
no
population
the
king
likes
the
spot
all
the
better
madame
tells
me
because
he
has
to
create
his
own
landscape
to
conjure
lakes
and
cataracts
out
of
dry
ground
the
buildings
have
been
but
two
years
in
progress
and
it
must
be
long
before
these
colossal
foundations
are
crowned
with
the
edifice
which
louis
and
his
architect
mansart
have
planned
colbert
is
furious
at
this
squandering
of
vast
sums
on
a
provincial
palace
while
the
louvre
the
birthplace
and
home
of
dynasties
remains
unfinished
the
king
reason
for
disliking
germain
a
ch√¢teau
his
mother
has
always
loved
has
in
it
something
childish
and
fantastic
if
as
my
dear
duchess
declares
he
hates
the
place
only
because
he
can
see
the
towers
of
denis
from
the
terrace
and
is
thus
hourly
reminded
of
death
and
the
grave
i
can
hardly
believe
that
a
being
of
such
superior
intelligence
could
be
governed
by
any
such
horror
of
man
inevitable
end
i
would
far
sooner
attribute
the
vast
expenditure
of
versailles
to
the
common
love
of
monarchs
and
great
men
for
building
houses
too
large
for
their
necessities
indeed
it
was
but
yesterday
that
fareham
took
me
to
see
the
palace
for
i
can
call
it
by
no
meaner
name
that
lord
clarendon
is
building
for
himself
in
the
open
country
at
the
top
of
james
street
it
promises
to
be
the
finest
house
in
town
and
although
not
covering
so
much
ground
as
whitehall
is
judged
far
superior
to
that
inchoate
mass
in
its
fine
proportions
and
the
perfect
symmetry
of
its
saloons
and
galleries
there
is
a
garden
projected
by
evelyn
a
great
authority
on
trees
and
gardens
a
crowd
of
fine
company
had
assembled
to
see
the
newly
finished
hall
and
dining
parlour
among
them
a
fussy
person
who
came
in
attendance
upon
my
lord
sandwich
and
who
was
more
voluble
than
became
his
quality
as
a
clerk
in
the
navy
office
he
was
periwigged
and
dressed
as
fine
as
his
master
and
on
my
being
civil
to
him
talked
much
of
himself
and
of
divers
taverns
in
the
city
where
the
dinners
were
either
vastly
good
or
vastly
ill
i
told
him
that
as
i
never
dined
at
a
tavern
the
subject
was
altogether
beyond
the
scope
of
my
intelligence
at
which
sandwich
and
fareham
laughed
and
my
pertinacious
gentleman
blushed
as
red
as
the
heels
of
his
shoes
i
am
told
the
creature
has
a
pretty
taste
in
music
and
is
the
son
of
a
tailor
but
professes
a
genteel
ancestry
and
occasionally
pushes
into
the
best
company
shall
i
describe
to
you
one
of
my
latest
conquests
sweetheart
is
a
boy
an
actual
beardless
boy
of
eighteen
summers
but
such
a
boy
so
beautiful
so
insolent
with
an
impudence
that
can
confront
lord
clarendon
himself
the
gravest
of
noblemen
who
with
the
sole
exception
of
my
lord
southampton
is
the
one
man
who
has
never
crossed
palmer
threshold
or
bowed
his
neck
under
that
splendid
fury
yoke
my
admirer
thinks
no
more
of
smoking
these
grave
nobles
men
of
a
former
generation
who
learnt
their
manners
at
the
court
of
a
serious
and
august
king
than
i
do
of
teasing
my
falcon
he
laughs
at
them
jokes
with
them
in
greek
or
in
latin
has
a
ready
answer
and
a
witty
quip
for
every
turn
of
the
discourse
will
even
interrupt
his
majesty
in
one
of
those
anecdotes
of
his
scottish
martyrdom
which
he
tells
so
well
and
tells
so
often
lucifer
himself
could
not
be
more
arrogant
or
more
audacious
than
this
bewitching
of
mine
who
writes
verses
in
english
or
latin
as
easy
as
i
can
toss
a
shuttlecock
i
doubt
the
greater
number
of
his
verses
are
scarce
proper
reading
for
you
or
me
angela
for
i
see
the
men
gather
round
him
in
corners
as
he
murmurs
his
latest
madrigal
to
a
chosen
or
so
and
i
guess
by
their
subdued
tittering
that
the
lines
are
not
over
modest
while
by
the
sidelong
glances
the
listeners
cast
round
now
at
my
lady
castlemaine
and
anon
at
some
other
goddess
in
the
royal
pantheon
i
have
a
shrewd
notion
as
to
what
alabaster
breast
my
witty
lover
shafts
are
aimed
at
this
youthful
devotee
of
mine
is
the
son
of
a
certain
lord
wilmot
who
fought
on
the
late
king
side
in
the
troubles
this
creature
went
to
the
university
of
oxford
at
twelve
years
old
as
it
were
straight
from
his
to
college
and
was
master
of
arts
at
fourteen
he
has
made
the
grand
tour
and
pretends
to
have
seen
so
much
of
this
life
that
he
has
found
out
the
worthlessness
of
it
even
while
he
woes
me
with
a
most
romantic
ardour
he
affects
to
have
outgrown
the
capacity
to
love
think
not
dearest
that
i
outstep
the
bounds
of
matronly
modesty
by
this
airy
philandering
with
my
young
lord
rochester
or
that
my
serious
fareham
is
ever
offended
at
our
pretty
trifling
he
laughs
at
the
lad
as
heartily
as
i
do
invites
him
to
our
table
and
is
amused
by
his
monkeyish
tricks
a
woman
of
quality
must
have
followers
and
a
pert
fantastical
boy
is
the
safest
of
lovers
slander
itself
could
scarce
accuse
lady
fareham
who
has
had
and
statesmen
at
her
feet
of
an
unworthy
tenderness
for
a
jackanapes
of
seventeen
for
indeed
i
believe
his
eighteenth
birthday
is
still
in
the
womb
of
time
i
would
with
all
my
heart
thou
wert
here
to
share
our
innocent
diversions
and
i
know
not
which
of
all
my
playthings
thou
wouldst
esteem
highest
the
falcon
my
darling
spaniels
made
up
of
soft
silken
curls
and
intelligent
brown
eyes
or
rochester
nay
let
me
not
forget
the
children
papillon
and
cupid
who
are
truly
very
pretty
creatures
though
consummate
plagues
the
girl
papillon
has
a
tongue
which
wilmot
says
is
the
nearest
approach
to
perpetual
motion
that
he
has
yet
discovered
and
the
boy
who
was
but
seven
last
birthday
is
full
of
mischief
in
which
my
admirer
counsels
and
abets
him
oh
this
london
sweetheart
and
this
court
how
wide
those
violet
eyes
would
open
couldst
thou
but
look
suddenly
in
upon
us
after
supper
at
basset
or
in
the
park
or
at
the
when
the
orange
girls
are
smoking
the
pretty
fellows
in
the
pit
and
my
lady
castlemaine
is
leaning
half
out
of
her
box
to
talk
to
the
king
in
his
i
thought
i
had
seen
enough
of
festivals
and
dances
and
courtly
diversions
beyond
sea
but
the
court
entertainments
at
paris
or
germain
differed
as
much
from
the
festivities
of
whitehall
as
a
cathedral
service
from
a
dance
in
a
booth
at
bartholomew
fair
his
majesty
of
france
never
forgets
that
he
is
a
king
his
majesty
of
england
only
remembers
his
kingship
when
he
wants
a
new
subsidy
or
to
get
a
bill
hurried
through
the
houses
louis
at
was
serious
enough
for
fifty
charles
at
has
the
careless
humour
of
a
schoolboy
he
is
royal
in
nothing
except
his
extravagance
which
has
squandered
more
millions
than
i
dare
mention
since
he
landed
at
dover
i
am
growing
almost
as
sober
as
my
solemn
spouse
who
will
ever
be
railing
at
the
king
and
the
duke
and
even
more
bitterly
at
the
favourite
his
grace
of
buckingham
who
is
assuredly
one
of
the
most
agreeable
men
in
london
i
asked
fareham
only
yesterday
why
he
went
to
court
if
his
majesty
company
is
thus
distasteful
to
him
is
not
to
his
company
i
object
but
to
his
principles
he
answered
in
that
earnest
fashion
of
his
which
takes
the
lightest
questions
grand
see
in
him
a
man
who
with
natural
parts
far
above
the
average
makes
himself
the
jest
of
meaner
intellects
and
the
dupe
of
greedy
courtesans
a
man
who
trained
in
the
stern
school
of
adversity
overshadowed
by
the
great
horror
of
his
father
tragical
doom
accepts
life
as
one
long
jest
and
being
by
a
concatenation
of
circumstances
bordering
on
the
miraculous
restored
to
the
privileges
of
hereditary
monarchy
takes
all
possible
pains
to
prove
the
uselessness
of
kings
i
see
a
man
who
borne
back
to
power
by
the
irresistible
current
of
the
people
affections
has
broken
every
pledge
he
gave
that
people
in
the
flush
and
triumph
of
his
return
i
see
one
who
in
his
own
person
cares
neither
for
paul
nor
peter
and
yet
can
tamely
witness
the
persecution
of
his
people
because
they
do
not
conform
to
a
state
religion
can
allow
good
and
pious
men
to
be
driven
out
of
the
pulpits
where
they
have
preached
the
gospel
of
christ
and
suffer
wives
and
children
to
starve
because
the
head
of
the
household
has
a
conscience
i
see
a
king
careless
of
the
welfare
of
his
people
and
the
honour
and
glory
of
his
reign
affecting
to
be
a
patriot
and
a
man
of
business
on
the
strength
of
an
extravagant
fancy
for
shipbuilding
careless
of
everything
save
the
empty
pleasure
of
an
idle
hour
a
king
who
lavishes
thousands
upon
wantons
and
profligates
and
who
ever
gives
not
to
the
most
worthy
but
to
the
most
importunate
i
laughed
at
this
tirade
and
told
him
what
indeed
i
believe
that
he
is
at
heart
a
puritan
and
would
better
consort
with
baxter
and
bunyan
and
that
frousy
crew
than
with
buckhurst
and
sedley
or
his
brilliant
kinsman
roscommon
from
her
father
directly
angela
heard
nothing
and
her
sister
allusions
to
him
were
of
the
briefest
anxiously
as
she
had
questioned
that
lively
yes
her
father
was
well
hyacinth
told
her
but
he
stayed
mostly
at
the
manor
moat
he
did
not
care
for
the
court
gaieties
i
believe
he
thinks
we
have
all
parted
company
with
our
wits
she
wrote
he
seldom
sees
me
but
to
lecture
me
in
a
sidelong
way
upon
my
folly
for
his
railing
at
the
company
i
keep
hits
me
by
implication
i
believe
these
old
courtiers
of
the
late
king
are
puritans
at
heart
and
that
if
archbishop
laud
were
alive
he
would
be
as
bitter
against
the
sins
of
the
town
as
any
of
the
anabaptists
that
preach
to
the
elect
in
back
rooms
and
blind
alleys
my
father
talks
and
thinks
as
if
he
had
spent
all
his
years
of
exile
in
the
cave
of
the
seven
sleepers
and
yet
he
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
some
of
the
finest
gentlemen
in
france
cond√©
turenne
gramont
evremond
bussy
and
the
rest
of
them
but
all
the
world
is
young
and
full
of
wit
and
mirth
since
his
majesty
came
to
his
own
and
elderly
limbs
are
too
stiff
to
trip
in
our
new
dances
i
doubt
my
father
mind
is
as
and
of
as
rigid
a
shape
as
his
court
suit
at
sight
of
which
my
best
friends
can
scarce
refrain
from
laughing
this
light
mention
of
a
parent
whom
she
reverenced
wounded
angela
to
the
quick
and
that
wound
was
deepened
a
year
later
when
she
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
her
father
of
which
no
letter
had
forewarned
her
she
was
walking
in
the
convent
garden
in
her
hour
of
recreation
tasting
the
sunny
air
and
the
beauty
of
the
tulips
in
the
long
narrow
borders
between
two
espalier
rows
trained
with
an
exquisite
neatness
and
reputed
to
bear
the
finest
golden
pippins
and
bergamot
pears
within
fifty
miles
of
the
city
the
trees
were
in
blossom
and
a
wall
of
pink
and
white
bloom
rose
up
on
either
hand
above
the
scarlet
and
amber
tulips
turning
at
the
end
of
the
long
alley
where
it
met
a
wall
that
in
august
was
flushed
with
the
crimson
velvet
of
peaches
and
nectarines
angela
saw
a
man
advancing
from
the
further
end
of
the
walk
attended
by
a
lay
sister
the
hat
and
pointed
beard
the
tall
figure
in
a
grey
doublet
crossed
with
a
black
the
walk
the
bearing
were
unmistakable
it
might
have
been
a
figure
that
had
stepped
out
of
vandyke
canvas
it
had
nothing
of
the
fuss
and
flutter
the
feathers
and
ruffles
the
loose
flow
of
brocade
and
velvet
that
marked
the
costume
of
the
young
french
court
angela
ran
to
receive
her
father
and
could
scarce
speak
to
him
she
was
so
startled
and
yet
so
glad
oh
sir
when
i
prayed
for
you
at
mass
this
morning
how
little
i
hoped
for
so
much
happiness
i
had
a
letter
from
hyacinth
only
a
week
ago
and
she
wrote
nothing
of
your
intentions
i
knew
not
that
you
had
crossed
the
sea
why
sweetheart
hyacinth
sees
me
too
rarely
and
is
too
full
of
her
own
affairs
ever
to
be
beforehand
with
my
intentions
and
although
i
have
been
long
heartily
sick
of
england
i
only
made
up
my
mind
to
come
to
flanders
less
than
a
week
ago
no
sooner
thought
of
than
done
i
came
by
our
old
road
in
a
merchant
craft
from
harwich
to
ostend
and
the
rest
of
the
way
in
the
saddle
not
quite
so
fast
as
they
used
to
ride
that
carried
his
majesty
post
from
london
to
york
in
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
when
the
loyal
gentlemen
along
the
north
road
would
galop
faster
with
despatches
and
treaties
than
ever
they
rode
after
a
stag
ah
child
how
hopeful
we
were
in
those
days
and
how
we
all
told
each
other
it
was
but
a
passing
storm
at
westminster
which
could
all
be
lulled
by
a
little
civil
concession
here
and
there
on
the
king
part
and
so
it
might
perhaps
if
he
would
but
have
conceded
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
yielded
but
just
the
inch
they
asked
for
when
they
first
asked
instead
of
till
they
got
angry
and
wanted
ells
instead
of
inches
is
the
stitch
in
time
angela
that
saves
trouble
in
politics
as
well
as
in
thy
petticoat
he
had
flung
his
arm
round
his
daughter
neck
as
they
paced
slowly
side
by
side
have
you
come
to
stay
at
louvain
sir
she
asked
timidly
nay
love
the
place
is
too
quiet
for
me
i
could
not
stay
in
a
town
that
is
given
over
to
learning
and
piety
the
sound
of
their
everlasting
carillon
would
tease
my
ear
with
the
thought
another
quarter
of
an
hour
gone
of
my
poor
remnant
of
days
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
doze
in
the
sunshine
or
fondle
my
spaniel
fill
my
pipe
or
ride
a
lazy
horse
on
a
level
road
such
as
i
have
ever
hated
but
why
did
you
tire
of
england
sir
i
thought
the
king
would
have
wanted
you
always
near
him
you
his
father
close
friend
who
suffered
so
much
for
royal
friendship
surely
he
loves
and
cherishes
you
he
must
be
a
base
ungrateful
man
if
he
do
not
oh
the
king
is
grateful
angela
grateful
enough
and
to
spare
he
never
sees
me
at
court
but
he
has
some
gracious
speech
about
his
father
regard
for
me
it
grows
irksome
at
last
by
sheer
repetition
the
turn
of
the
sentence
varies
for
his
majesty
has
a
fine
standing
army
of
words
but
the
gist
of
the
phrase
is
always
the
same
and
it
means
is
a
tiresome
old
put
to
whom
i
must
say
something
civil
for
the
sake
of
his
ancient
vicissitudes
and
then
his
phalanx
of
foppery
stares
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
topinambou
and
since
i
have
seen
them
mimic
ned
hyde
stately
speech
and
manners
i
doubt
not
before
i
have
crossed
the
i
have
served
to
make
sport
for
the
crew
since
their
wit
has
but
two
phases
ordure
and
mimickry
look
not
so
glum
daughter
i
am
glad
to
be
out
of
a
court
which
is
most
like
such
places
as
i
dare
not
name
to
thee
but
to
have
you
disrespected
sir
you
so
brave
so
noble
you
who
gave
the
best
years
of
your
life
to
your
royal
master
what
i
gave
i
gave
child
i
gave
him
youth
that
never
comes
back
and
fortune
that
is
not
worth
grieving
for
and
now
that
i
have
begun
to
lose
the
reckoning
of
my
years
since
fifty
i
feel
i
had
best
take
myself
back
to
that
roving
life
in
which
i
have
no
time
to
brood
upon
losses
and
sorrows
dear
father
i
am
sure
you
must
mistake
the
king
feelings
towards
you
it
is
not
possible
that
he
can
think
lightly
of
such
devotion
as
yours
nay
sweetheart
who
said
he
thinks
lightly
he
never
thinks
of
me
at
all
or
of
anything
serious
under
god
sky
so
long
as
he
has
spending
money
and
can
live
in
a
circle
of
bright
eyes
and
hear
only
flippant
tongues
that
offer
him
a
curious
incense
of
flattery
spiced
with
impertinence
charles
stuart
has
all
of
this
life
that
he
values
and
for
the
next
a
man
who
is
shrewdly
suspected
of
being
a
papist
while
he
is
attached
by
gravest
vows
to
the
church
of
england
must
needs
hold
heaven
rewards
and
hell
torments
lightly
but
queen
catherine
sir
does
not
she
favour
you
my
aunt
says
she
is
a
good
woman
yes
a
good
woman
and
the
nearest
approach
to
a
cypher
to
be
found
at
hampton
court
or
whitehall
young
lord
rochester
has
written
a
poem
upon
he
might
have
taken
queen
catherine
name
as
a
synonym
she
is
nothing
she
counts
for
nothing
her
love
can
benefit
nobody
her
hatred
were
the
poor
soul
capable
of
hating
persistently
can
do
no
one
harm
and
the
king
is
he
so
unkind
to
her
unkind
no
he
allows
her
to
live
nay
when
for
a
few
days
the
brief
felicity
of
her
poor
life
she
seemed
on
the
point
of
dying
he
was
stricken
with
remorse
for
all
that
he
had
not
been
to
her
and
was
kind
and
begged
her
to
live
for
his
sake
the
polite
gentleman
meant
it
for
a
compliment
one
of
those
pious
falsehoods
that
men
murmur
in
dying
ears
but
she
took
him
at
his
word
and
recovered
and
she
is
there
still
a
little
dark
lady
in
a
fine
gown
of
whom
nobody
takes
any
notice
beyond
the
emptiest
formality
of
bent
knees
and
backward
steps
there
are
long
evenings
at
hampton
court
in
which
she
is
scarce
spoken
to
save
when
she
fawns
upon
the
fortunate
lady
whom
she
began
by
hating
oh
child
i
should
not
talk
to
you
of
these
things
but
some
of
the
disgust
that
has
made
my
life
bitter
bubbles
over
in
spite
of
me
i
am
a
wanderer
and
an
exile
again
dear
heart
i
would
sooner
trail
a
pike
abroad
than
suffer
neglect
at
home
i
will
fight
under
any
flag
so
long
as
it
flies
not
for
my
country
foe
i
am
going
back
to
my
old
friends
at
the
louvre
to
those
few
who
are
old
enough
to
care
for
me
and
if
there
come
a
war
with
spain
why
my
sword
may
be
of
some
small
use
to
young
louis
whose
mother
was
always
gracious
to
me
in
the
old
days
at
germain
when
she
knew
not
in
the
morning
whether
she
would
go
safe
to
bed
at
night
a
golden
age
of
peace
has
followed
that
wild
time
but
the
spanish
king
death
is
like
to
light
the
torch
and
set
the
barking
louis
will
thrust
his
sword
through
the
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
if
he
see
the
way
to
a
throne
side
of
the
mountains
but
could
a
good
man
violate
a
treaty
ambition
knows
no
laws
sweet
nor
ever
has
since
hannibal
then
king
louis
is
no
better
a
man
than
king
charles
i
can
not
answer
for
that
angela
but
i
warrant
him
a
better
king
from
the
kingly
point
of
view
scarce
had
death
freed
him
from
the
than
he
snatched
the
reins
of
power
showed
his
ministers
that
he
meant
to
drive
the
coach
he
has
a
head
as
fit
for
business
as
if
he
had
been
the
son
of
a
mazarin
took
pains
to
keep
him
ignorant
of
everything
that
a
king
ought
to
know
but
that
shrewd
judgment
of
his
taught
him
that
he
must
know
as
much
as
his
servants
unless
he
wanted
them
to
be
his
masters
he
has
the
pride
of
lucifer
with
a
strength
of
will
and
power
of
application
as
great
as
richelieu
you
will
live
to
see
that
no
second
richelieu
no
new
mazarin
will
arise
in
his
reign
his
ministers
will
serve
him
and
go
down
before
him
like
nicolas
fouquet
to
whom
he
has
been
implacable
poor
gentleman
my
aunt
told
me
that
when
his
judges
sentenced
him
to
banishment
from
france
the
king
changed
the
sentence
to
imprisonment
for
life
i
doubt
if
the
king
ever
forgave
those
f√™tes
at
vaux
which
were
designed
to
dazzle
mademoiselle
la
valli√®re
whom
this
man
had
the
presumption
to
love
one
may
pity
so
terrible
a
fall
yet
it
is
but
the
ruin
of
a
bold
sensualist
who
played
with
millions
as
other
men
play
with
tennis
balls
and
who
would
have
drained
the
exchequer
by
his
briberies
and
extravagances
if
he
had
not
been
brought
to
a
dead
stop
the
world
has
been
growing
wickeder
dearest
while
this
fair
head
has
risen
from
my
knee
to
my
shoulder
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
its
wickedness
here
you
are
happy
and
at
peace
not
happy
father
if
you
are
to
hazard
your
life
in
battles
and
sieges
oh
sir
that
life
is
too
dear
to
us
your
children
to
be
risked
so
lightly
you
have
done
your
share
of
soldiering
everybody
that
ever
heard
your
name
in
england
or
in
france
knows
it
is
the
name
of
a
brave
captain
a
leader
of
men
for
our
sakes
take
your
rest
now
dear
sir
i
should
not
sleep
in
peace
if
i
knew
you
were
with
cond√©
army
i
should
dream
of
you
wounded
and
dying
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
leaving
my
aunt
now
that
she
is
old
and
feeble
but
my
first
duty
is
to
you
and
if
you
want
me
i
will
go
with
you
wherever
you
may
please
to
make
your
home
i
am
not
afraid
of
strange
countries
spoken
like
my
sweet
daughter
whose
baby
arms
clasped
my
neck
in
the
day
of
despair
but
you
must
stay
with
the
reverend
mother
sweetheart
these
bones
of
mine
must
be
something
stiffer
before
they
will
consent
to
rest
in
the
chimney
corner
or
sit
in
the
shade
of
a
yew
hedge
while
other
men
throw
the
bowls
when
i
have
knocked
about
the
world
a
few
years
longer
and
when
mother
anastasia
is
at
rest
thou
shalt
come
to
me
at
the
manor
and
i
will
find
thee
a
noble
husband
and
will
end
my
days
with
my
children
and
grandchildren
the
world
has
so
changed
since
the
forties
that
i
shall
think
i
have
lived
centuries
instead
of
decades
when
the
farewell
hour
strikes
in
the
mean
time
i
am
pleased
that
you
should
be
here
the
court
is
no
place
for
a
pure
maiden
though
some
sweet
saints
there
be
who
can
walk
unsmirched
in
the
midst
of
corruption
and
hyacinth
she
can
walk
scatheless
through
that
court
furnace
she
writes
of
whitehall
as
if
it
were
paradise
hyacinth
has
a
husband
to
take
care
of
her
a
man
with
a
brave
headpiece
of
his
own
who
lets
her
spark
it
with
the
fairest
company
in
the
town
but
would
make
short
work
of
any
fop
who
dared
attempt
the
insolence
of
a
suitor
hyacinth
has
seen
the
worst
and
the
best
of
two
courts
and
has
an
experience
of
the
palais
royal
and
germain
which
should
keep
her
safe
at
whitehall
sir
john
and
his
daughter
spent
half
a
day
together
in
the
garden
and
the
parlour
where
the
traveller
was
entertained
with
a
collation
and
a
bottle
of
excellent
beaujolais
before
his
horse
was
brought
to
the
door
angela
saw
him
mount
and
ride
slowly
away
in
the
melancholy
afternoon
light
and
she
felt
as
if
he
were
riding
out
of
her
life
for
ever
she
went
back
to
her
aunt
room
with
an
aching
heart
had
not
that
kind
lady
her
mother
in
all
the
essentials
of
maternal
love
been
so
near
the
end
of
her
days
and
so
dependent
on
her
niece
affection
the
girl
would
have
clung
about
her
father
neck
and
implored
him
to
go
no
more
and
to
make
himself
a
home
with
her
in
england
chapter
iv

evening
while
the
nightingales
were
singing
in
the
convent
garden
that
the
holy
life
slipped
away
into
the
great
unknown
she
died
as
a
child
falls
asleep
the
saintly
grey
head
lying
peacefully
on
supporting
arm
the
last
look
of
the
dying
eyes
resting
on
that
tender
nurse
with
infinite
love
she
was
gone
and
angela
felt
strangely
alone
her
contemporaries
the
chosen
friend
who
had
been
to
her
almost
as
a
sister
the
girls
by
whose
side
she
had
sat
in
class
had
all
left
the
convent
at
years
of
age
she
seemed
to
belong
to
a
former
generation
most
of
the
pupils
had
finished
their
education
at
seventeen
or
eighteen
and
had
returned
to
their
homes
in
flanders
france
or
england
there
had
been
several
english
pupils
for
louvain
and
douai
had
for
a
century
been
the
seminaries
for
english
romanists
the
pupils
of
were
angela
juniors
with
whom
she
had
nothing
in
common
except
to
teach
english
to
a
class
of
small
flemings
who
were
almost
unteachable
she
had
heard
no
more
from
her
father
and
knew
not
where
or
with
whom
he
might
have
cast
in
his
lot
she
wrote
to
him
under
cover
to
her
sister
but
of
late
hyacinth
letters
had
been
rare
and
brief
only
long
enough
indeed
to
apologise
for
their
brevity
lady
fareham
had
been
in
london
or
at
hampton
court
from
the
beginning
of
the
previous
winter
there
was
talk
of
the
plague
having
come
to
london
from
amsterdam
that
the
privy
council
was
sitting
at
sion
house
instead
of
in
london
that
the
judges
had
removed
to
windsor
and
that
the
court
might
speedily
remove
to
salisbury
or
oxford
and
if
the
court
goes
to
oxford
we
shall
go
to
chilton
wrote
hyacinth
and
that
was
the
last
of
her
communications
july
passed
without
news
from
father
or
sister
and
angela
grew
daily
more
uneasy
about
both
the
great
horror
of
the
plague
was
in
the
air
it
had
been
raging
in
amsterdam
in
the
previous
summer
and
autumn
and
a
nun
had
brought
the
disease
to
louvain
where
she
might
have
died
in
the
convent
infirmary
but
for
angela
devoted
attention
she
had
assisted
the
infirmarian
at
a
time
of
unusual
sickness
for
there
was
a
good
deal
of
illness
among
the
nuns
and
pupils
that
summer
mostly
engendered
of
the
fear
lest
the
pestilence
in
holland
should
reach
flanders
doctor
and
infirmarian
had
alike
praised
the
girl
quiet
courage
and
her
instinct
for
doing
the
right
thing
remembering
all
the
nun
had
told
of
the
horrors
of
amsterdam
angela
awaited
with
fear
and
trembling
for
news
from
london
and
as
the
summer
wore
on
every
that
reached
the
ursulines
brought
tidings
of
increasing
sickness
in
the
great
prosperous
city
which
was
being
gradually
deserted
by
all
who
could
afford
to
travel
the
court
had
moved
first
to
hampton
court
in
june
and
later
to
salisbury
where
again
the
french
ambassador
people
reported
strange
horrors
corpses
found
lying
in
the
street
hard
by
their
lodgings
the
king
servants
sickening
the
air
of
the
cathedral
city
was
tainted
though
deaths
had
been
few
as
compared
with
london
which
was
becoming
one
vast
and
it
was
thought
the
court
and
ambassadors
would
remove
themselves
to
oxford
where
parliament
was
to
assemble
in
the
autumn
instead
of
at
westminster
most
alarming
of
all
was
the
news
that
the
had
fled
with
all
her
people
and
most
of
her
treasures
from
her
palace
at
somerset
house
for
henrietta
maria
was
not
a
woman
to
fly
before
a
phantom
fear
she
had
seen
too
much
of
the
stern
realities
of
life
to
be
scared
by
shadows
and
she
had
neither
establishment
nor
power
in
france
equal
to
those
she
left
in
england
in
paris
the
daughter
of
the
great
henry
was
a
dependent
in
london
she
was
second
only
to
the
king
and
her
court
was
more
esteemed
than
whitehall
if
she
has
fled
there
must
be
reason
for
it
said
the
newly
elected
superior
who
boasted
of
correspondents
at
paris
notably
a
cousin
in
that
famous
convent
the
visitandines
de
chaillot
founded
by
queen
henrietta
and
which
had
ever
been
a
centre
of
political
and
religious
intrigue
the
most
fashionable
patrician
exalted
and
altogether
worldly
establishment
alarmed
at
this
dismal
news
angela
wrote
urgently
to
her
sister
but
with
no
effect
and
the
passage
of
every
day
with
occasional
rumours
of
an
increasing
in
london
strengthened
her
fears
until
terror
nerved
her
to
a
desperate
resolve
she
would
go
to
london
to
see
her
sister
to
nurse
her
if
she
were
sick
to
mourn
for
her
if
she
were
dead
the
superior
did
all
she
could
to
oppose
this
decision
and
even
asserted
authority
over
the
pupil
who
since
her
eighteenth
year
had
been
released
from
discipline
subject
but
to
the
lightest
laws
of
the
convent
as
the
and
beloved
child
of
the
late
superior
she
had
enjoyed
all
possible
privileges
while
the
liberal
sum
annually
remitted
for
her
maintenance
gave
her
a
certain
importance
in
the
house
and
now
on
being
told
she
must
not
go
her
spirit
rose
against
the
superior
authority
i
recognise
no
earthly
power
that
can
keep
me
from
those
i
love
in
their
time
of
peril
she
said
you
do
not
know
that
they
are
in
sickness
or
danger
my
last
letters
from
paris
stated
that
it
was
only
the
low
people
whom
the
contagion
in
london
was
attacking
if
it
was
only
the
low
people
why
did
the
leave
if
it
was
safe
for
my
sister
to
be
in
london
it
would
have
been
safe
for
the
queen
lady
fareham
is
doubtless
in
oxfordshire
i
have
written
to
chilton
abbey
as
well
as
to
fareham
house
and
i
can
get
no
answer
indeed
reverend
mother
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
to
those
to
whom
i
belong
i
never
meant
to
stay
in
this
house
after
my
aunt
death
i
have
only
been
waiting
my
father
orders
if
all
be
well
with
my
sister
i
shall
go
to
the
manor
moat
and
wait
his
commands
quietly
there
i
am
for
england
you
have
chosen
an
ill
time
for
when
a
pestilence
is
raging
argument
could
not
touch
the
girl
whose
mind
was
braced
for
battle
the
reverend
mother
ceded
with
as
good
a
grace
as
she
could
assume
on
the
top
of
a
very
arbitrary
temper
an
english
priest
was
heard
of
who
was
about
to
travel
to
london
on
his
return
to
a
noble
friend
and
patron
in
the
north
of
england
in
whose
house
he
had
lived
before
the
troubles
and
in
this
good
man
charge
angela
was
permitted
to
depart
on
a
long
and
weary
journey
by
way
of
antwerp
and
the
scheldt
they
were
five
days
at
sea
the
voyage
lengthened
by
the
almost
unprecedented
calm
which
had
prevailed
all
that
fatal
summer
a
weary
voyage
in
a
small
trading
vessel
on
board
which
angela
had
to
suffer
every
hardship
that
a
delicate
woman
can
be
subjected
to
on
board
ship
a
wretched
berth
in
a
floating
cellar
called
a
cabin
want
of
fresh
water
of
female
attendance
and
of
any
food
but
the
coarsest
these
deprivations
she
bore
without
a
murmur
it
was
only
the
slowness
of
the
passage
that
troubled
her
the
great
city
came
in
view
at
last
the
long
roof
of
paul
dominating
the
thickly
clustered
gables
and
chimneys
and
the
vessel
dropped
anchor
opposite
the
dark
walls
of
the
tower
whose
form
had
been
made
familiar
to
angela
by
a
print
in
a
history
of
london
which
she
had
hung
over
many
an
evening
in
mother
anastasia
parlour
a
conveyed
her
and
her
to
the
tower
stairs
where
they
landed
the
priest
being
duly
provided
with
an
efficient
voucher
that
they
came
from
a
city
free
of
the
plague
yes
this
was
london
her
foot
touched
her
native
soil
for
the
first
time
after
fifteen
years
of
absence
the
priest
would
not
leave
her
till
he
had
seen
her
in
charge
of
an
elderly
and
most
reputable
waterman
recommended
by
the
custodian
of
the
stairs
then
he
bade
her
an
affectionate
adieu
and
fared
on
his
way
to
a
house
in
the
city
where
one
of
his
kinsfolk
a
devout
catholic
dwelt
quietly
hidden
from
the
public
eye
and
where
he
would
rest
for
the
night
before
setting
out
on
his
journey
to
the
north
after
the
impetuous
passage
through
the
deep
dark
arch
of
the
bridge
the
boat
moved
slowly
up
the
river
in
the
peaceful
eventide
and
angela
eyes
opened
wide
with
wonder
as
she
looked
on
the
splendours
of
that
silent
highway
this
evening
verily
silent
for
the
traffic
of
business
and
pleasure
had
stopped
in
the
terror
of
the
pestilence
like
a
clock
that
had
run
down
it
was
said
by
one
who
had
seen
the
fairest
cities
of
europe
that
the
most
glorious
sight
in
the
world
take
land
and
water
together
was
to
come
upon
a
high
tide
from
gravesend
and
shoot
the
bridge
to
westminster
and
to
the
maiden
how
much
more
astonishing
was
that
prospect
the
boat
passed
in
front
of
lord
arundel
sumptuous
mansion
with
its
spacious
garden
where
marble
statues
showed
white
in
the
midst
of
quincunxes
and
prim
hedges
of
cypress
and
yew
past
the
palace
of
the
savoy
with
its
massive
towers
battlemented
roof
and
double
line
of
mullioned
windows
fronting
the
river
past
worcester
house
where
lord
chancellor
hyde
had
been
living
in
a
sober
splendour
while
his
princely
mansion
was
building
yonder
on
the
hounslow
road
or
that
portion
thereof
lately
known
as
piccadilly
that
was
the
ambitious
pile
of
which
hyacinth
had
written
a
house
of
clouded
memories
and
briefest
tenure
foredoomed
to
vanish
like
a
palace
seen
in
a
dream
a
transient
magnificence
indescribable
known
for
a
little
while
opprobriously
as
dunkirk
house
the
supposed
result
of
the
chancellor
too
facile
assistance
in
the
surrender
of
that
last
rag
of
french
territory
the
boat
passed
before
rutland
house
and
cecil
house
some
portion
of
which
had
lately
been
converted
into
the
middle
exchange
the
haunt
of
fine
ladies
and
golconda
of
gentlewomen
milliners
favourite
scene
for
assignations
and
intrigues
and
so
by
durham
house
where
in
the
protector
seymour
time
the
royal
mint
had
been
established
a
house
whose
stately
rooms
were
haunted
by
tragic
associations
shadows
of
northumberland
niece
and
victim
hapless
jane
grey
and
of
fated
raleigh
here
too
commerce
shouldered
aristocracy
and
the
new
exchange
of
king
james
time
competed
with
the
middle
exchange
of
later
date
providing
more
milliners
perfumers
glovers
barbers
and
toymen
and
more
opportunity
for
illicit
loves
and
secret
meetings
before
angela
eyes
those
splendid
mansions
passed
like
phantom
pictures
the
westering
sunlight
showed
golden
above
the
dark
abbey
while
she
sat
silent
with
gaze
looking
out
upon
this
widespread
city
that
lay
chastened
and
afflicted
under
the
hand
of
an
angry
god
the
beautiful
gay
proud
and
splendid
london
of
the
west
the
new
london
of
covent
garden
james
street
and
piccadilly
whose
glories
her
sister
pen
had
depicted
with
such
fond
enthusiasm
was
now
deserted
by
the
rabble
of
quality
who
had
peopled
its
palaces
while
the
old
london
of
the
east
the
historic
city
was
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
a
place
of
lamentations
a
city
where
men
and
women
rose
up
in
the
morning
hale
and
healthy
and
at
were
carried
away
in
the
to
be
flung
into
the
pit
where
the
dead
lay
shroudless
and
unhonoured
how
still
and
sweet
the
summer
air
seemed
in
that
sunset
hour
how
placid
the
light
ripple
of
the
incoming
tide
how
soothing
even
the
silence
of
the
city
and
yet
it
all
meant
death
it
was
but
a
few
months
since
the
fatal
infection
had
been
brought
from
holland
in
a
bundle
of
merchandise
and
behold
through
city
and
suburbs
the
pestilence
had
crept
with
slow
and
stealthy
foot
now
on
this
side
of
a
street
now
on
another
the
history
of
the
plague
was
like
a
game
at
draughts
where
man
after
man
vanishes
off
the
board
and
the
game
can
only
end
by
exhaustion
see
mistress
yonder
is
somerset
house
said
the
boatman
pointing
to
one
of
the
most
commanding
fa√ßades
in
that
highway
of
palaces
that
is
the
palace
which
the
has
raised
from
the
ashes
of
the
ruins
her
folly
made
for
the
husband
who
loved
her
too
well
she
came
back
to
us
no
wiser
for
years
of
exile
came
back
with
her
priests
and
her
italian
her
and
golden
candlesticks
and
gaudy
rags
of
rome
she
fled
from
england
with
the
roar
of
cannon
in
her
ears
and
the
fear
of
death
in
her
heart
she
came
back
in
pride
and
and
boasted
that
had
she
known
the
english
people
better
she
would
never
have
gone
away
and
she
has
squandered
thousands
in
yonder
palace
upon
floors
of
coloured
woods
and
italian
marbles
the
people
money
mark
you
money
that
should
have
built
ships
and
fed
sailors
and
she
meant
to
end
her
days
among
us
but
a
worse
enemy
than
cromwell
has
driven
her
out
of
the
house
that
she
made
beautiful
for
herself
and
who
knows
if
she
will
ever
see
london
again
then
those
were
right
who
told
me
that
it
was
for
fear
of
the
plague
her
majesty
left
london
said
angela
for
what
else
should
she
flee
she
was
loth
enough
to
leave
you
may
be
sure
for
she
had
seated
herself
in
her
pride
yonder
and
her
court
was
as
splendid
and
more
looked
up
to
than
queen
catherine
the
is
the
prouder
woman
and
held
her
head
higher
than
her
son
wife
has
ever
dared
to
hold
hers
yet
there
are
those
who
say
king
charles
widow
has
fallen
so
low
as
to
marry
lord
albans
a
son
of
belial
who
would
hazard
his
immortal
soul
on
a
cast
of
the
dice
and
lose
it
as
freely
as
he
has
squandered
his
royal
mistress
money
she
paid
for
jermyn
feasting
and
in
paris
is
said
when
her
son
and
his
friends
were
on
short
commons
you
do
wrong
to
slander
that
royal
lady
remonstrated
angela
she
is
of
all
widows
the
saddest
and
most
desolate
ever
the
mark
of
evil
fortune
even
in
the
glorious
year
of
her
son
restoration
sorrow
pursued
her
and
she
had
to
mourn
a
daughter
and
a
son
she
is
a
most
unhappy
lady
you
would
scarcely
say
as
much
young
madam
had
you
seen
her
in
her
pomp
and
power
yonder
and
as
for
lord
albans
if
he
is
not
her
husband
well
thou
art
a
young
innocent
thing
so
i
had
best
hold
my
peace
both
palaces
are
empty
and
forsaken
both
whitehall
and
somerset
house
the
rats
and
the
spiders
can
take
their
own
pleasure
in
the
rooms
that
were
full
of
music
and
dancing
and
feasting
two
or
three
months
ago
why
there
was
no
better
sight
in
london
after
the
than
to
watch
the
train
of
carriages
and
horsemen
carts
and
wagons
upon
any
of
the
great
carrying
the
people
of
london
away
to
the
country
as
if
the
whole
city
had
been
moving
in
one
mass
like
a
routed
army
but
in
palaces
and
noblemen
houses
surely
there
would
be
little
danger
said
angela
plagues
and
fevers
are
the
outcome
of
hunger
and
uncleanliness
and
all
such
evils
as
the
poor
have
to
suffer
nay
but
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness
is
no
respecter
of
persons
answered
the
grim
boatman
i
grant
you
that
death
has
dealt
hardest
with
the
poor
who
dwell
in
crowded
lanes
and
alleys
but
now
the
very
air
reeks
with
poison
it
may
be
carried
in
the
folds
of
a
gown
or
among
the
feathers
of
a
courtier
hat
they
are
wise
to
go
who
can
go
it
is
only
such
as
i
who
have
to
work
for
my
bread
that
must
needs
stay
you
speak
like
one
who
has
seen
better
days
said
angela
i
was
a
sergeant
in
hampden
regiment
madam
and
went
all
through
the
war
when
the
king
came
back
i
had
friends
who
stood
by
me
and
bought
me
this
boat
i
was
used
to
handle
an
oar
in
my
boyhood
when
i
lived
on
a
little
bit
of
a
farm
that
belonged
to
my
father
between
reading
and
henley
i
was
oftener
on
the
water
than
on
the
land
in
those
days
there
are
some
who
have
treated
me
roughly
because
i
fought
against
the
late
king
but
folks
are
beginning
to
find
out
that
the
brewer
disbanded
can
be
honest
and
serviceable
in
time
of
peace
after
passing
the
desolate
palace
the
boat
crept
along
near
the
middlesex
shore
till
it
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
a
flight
of
stone
steps
against
which
the
tide
washed
with
a
pleasant
rippling
sound
and
above
which
there
rose
the
walls
of
a
stately
building
facing
small
as
compared
with
somerset
and
northumberland
houses
midway
between
which
it
stood
yet
a
spacious
and
noble
mansion
with
a
richly
decorated
lofty
windows
with
sculptured
pediments
floriated
cornice
and
two
side
towers
topped
with
leaded
cupolas
the
whole
edifice
gilded
by
the
low
sun
and
very
beautiful
to
look
upon
the
windows
gleaming
as
if
there
were
a
thousand
candles
burning
within
a
light
that
gave
a
false
idea
of
life
and
festivity
since
that
brilliant
illumination
was
only
a
reflected
glory
this
madam
is
fareham
house
said
the
boatman
holding
out
his
hand
for
his
fee
he
charged
treble
the
sum
he
would
have
asked
half
a
year
ago
in
this
time
of
evil
those
intrepid
spirits
who
still
plied
their
trades
in
the
tainted
city
demanded
a
heavy
fee
for
their
labour
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
dispute
their
claim
since
each
man
knew
that
he
risked
his
life
and
that
the
limbs
which
toiled
might
be
lifeless
clay
there
was
an
awfulness
about
the
time
a
taste
and
odour
of
death
mixed
with
all
the
common
things
of
daily
life
a
morbid
dwelling
upon
thoughts
of
corruption
a
feverish
expectancy
of
the
end
of
all
things
which
no
man
can
rightly
conceive
who
has
not
passed
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
angela
paid
the
man
his
price
without
question
she
stepped
lightly
from
the
boat
while
he
deposited
her
two
small
trunks
on
the
stone
in
front
of
the
italian
terrace
which
occupied
the
whole
length
of
the
fa√ßade
she
went
up
a
flight
of
marble
steps
to
a
door
facing
the
river
here
she
rang
a
bell
which
pealed
long
and
loud
over
the
quiet
water
a
bell
that
must
have
been
heard
upon
the
surrey
shore
yet
no
one
opened
the
great
oak
door
and
angela
had
a
sudden
sinking
at
the
heart
as
the
slow
minutes
passed
and
brought
no
sound
of
footsteps
within
no
scrooping
of
a
bolt
to
betoken
the
opening
of
the
door
belike
the
house
is
deserted
madam
said
the
boatman
who
had
moored
his
wherry
to
the
and
had
carried
the
two
trunks
to
the
doorstep
you
had
best
try
if
the
door
be
fastened
or
no
stay
he
cried
suddenly
pointing
upwards
go
not
in
madam
for
your
life
look
at
the
red
cross
on
the
door
the
sign
of
a
house
angela
looked
up
with
awe
and
horror
a
great
cross
was
smeared
upon
the
door
with
red
paint
and
above
it
some
one
had
scrawled
the
words
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
and
the
sister
she
loved
and
the
children
whose
faces
she
had
never
seen
were
within
that
house
sick
and
in
peril
of
death
perhaps
dying
or
dead
she
did
not
hesitate
for
an
instant
but
took
hold
of
the
heavy
iron
ring
which
served
as
a
handle
for
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
i
have
no
fear
for
myself
she
said
to
the
boatman
i
have
nursed
the
sick
and
the
and
am
not
afraid
of
contagion
and
there
are
those
within
whom
i
love
good
night
friend
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
somewhat
stiffly
in
her
hand
but
it
did
turn
and
the
door
opened
and
she
stood
upon
the
threshold
looking
into
a
vast
hall
that
was
wrapped
in
shadow
save
for
a
shaft
of
golden
light
that
streamed
from
an
oval
window
on
the
staircase
other
windows
there
were
on
each
side
of
the
door
shuttered
and
barred
seeing
her
enter
the
house
the
old
cromwellian
shrugged
his
shoulders
shook
his
head
despondently
shoved
the
two
trunks
hastily
over
the
threshold
ran
back
to
his
boat
and
pushed
off
god
guard
thy
young
life
mistress
he
cried
and
the
wherry
shot
out
into
the
stream
there
had
been
silence
on
the
river
the
silence
of
a
deserted
city
at
eventide
but
that
had
seemed
as
nothing
to
the
stillness
of
this
hall
where
the
sunset
was
reflected
on
the
dark
oak
panelling
in
one
lurid
splash
like
blood
not
a
mortal
to
be
seen
not
a
sound
of
voice
or
footstep
a
crowd
of
gods
and
goddesses
in
draperies
of
azure
and
crimson
purple
and
orange
looked
down
from
the
ceiling
curtains
of
tawny
velvet
hung
beside
the
shuttered
windows
a
great
brazen
candelabrum
filled
with
candles
stood
tall
and
splendid
at
the
foot
of
a
wide
oak
staircase
the
whereof
was
cushioned
with
tawny
velvet
splendour
of
fabric
wood
and
marble
colour
and
gilding
showed
on
every
side
but
of
humanity
there
was
no
sign
angela
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
all
that
splendour
as
if
death
were
playing
hide
and
seek
in
those
voluminous
curtains
or
were
lurking
in
the
deep
shadow
which
the
massive
staircase
cast
across
the
hall
she
looked
about
her
full
of
fear
then
seeing
a
silver
bell
upon
the
table
she
took
it
up
and
rang
it
loudly
upon
the
same
carved
ebony
table
there
lay
a
plumed
hat
a
cane
with
an
amber
handle
and
a
velvet
cloak
neatly
folded
as
if
placed
ready
for
the
master
of
the
house
when
he
went
abroad
but
looking
at
these
things
closely
even
in
that
dim
light
she
saw
that
cloak
and
hat
were
white
with
dust
and
more
even
than
the
silence
that
spectacle
of
the
thick
dust
on
the
dark
velvet
impressed
her
with
the
idea
of
a
deserted
house
she
had
no
lack
of
courage
this
pupil
of
the
flemish
nuns
and
her
footstep
did
not
falter
as
she
went
quickly
up
the
broad
staircase
until
she
found
herself
in
a
spacious
gallery
and
amidst
a
flood
of
light
for
the
windows
on
this
upper
or
noble
floor
were
all
unshuttered
and
the
sunset
streamed
in
through
the
lofty
italian
casements
fareham
house
was
built
upon
the
plan
of
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
of
which
the
illustrious
catherine
de
vivonne
was
herself
at
once
owner
and
architect
the
staircase
instead
of
being
a
central
feature
was
at
the
western
end
of
the
house
allowing
space
for
an
unbroken
suite
of
rooms
communicating
one
with
the
other
and
terminating
in
an
apartment
with
a
fine
oriel
window
looking
east
the
folding
doors
of
a
spacious
saloon
stood
wide
open
and
angela
entered
a
room
whose
splendour
was
a
surprise
to
her
who
had
been
accustomed
to
the
sober
simplicity
of
a
convent
parlour
and
the
cold
grey
walls
of
the
refectory
where
the
only
picture
was
a
pinched
and
angular
virgin
by
memling
and
the
only
ornament
a
crucifix
of
ebony
and
brass
here
for
the
first
time
she
beheld
a
saloon
for
whose
decoration
palaces
had
been
ransacked
and
churches
desecrated
the
stolen
treasures
of
many
an
ancestral
mansion
spoil
of
rough
soldiery
or
city
rabble
things
that
had
been
slyly
stowed
away
by
their
possessors
during
the
stern
simplicity
of
the
commonwealth
and
had
been
brought
out
of
their
and
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
gold
and
silver
had
been
melted
down
in
the
great
rebellion
but
art
treasures
would
not
serve
to
pay
soldiers
or
to
buy
ammunition
so
these
had
escaped
the
at
home
and
abroad
the
storehouses
of
curiosity
merchants
had
been
explored
to
beautify
lady
fareham
and
in
the
fading
light
angela
gazed
upon
hangings
that
were
worthy
of
a
royal
palace
upon
italian
crystals
and
indian
carvings
upon
ivory
and
amber
and
jade
and
jasper
upon
tables
of
florentine
mosaic
and
ebony
cabinets
incrusted
with
rare
agates
and
upon
pictures
in
frames
of
massive
and
elaborate
carving
venetian
mirrors
which
gave
back
the
dying
light
from
a
thousand
facets
curtains
and
porti√®res
of
sumptuous
brocade
gorgeous
with
the
silken
semblance
of
peacock
plumage
done
with
the
needle
from
the
royal
manufactory
of
the
crown
furniture
at
the
gobelins
she
passed
into
an
with
tapestried
walls
and
a
divan
covered
with
raised
velvet
a
music
desk
of
gilded
wood
and
a
spinet
on
which
was
painted
the
story
of
orpheus
and
eurydice
beyond
this
there
was
the
more
soberly
though
no
less
richly
furnished
than
the
saloon
here
the
hangings
were
of
cordovan
leather
stamped
and
gilded
with
suggesting
a
french
origin
and
indeed
these
very
hangings
had
been
bought
by
a
dutch
jew
dealer
in
the
time
of
the
fronde
had
belonged
to
the
hated
minister
mazarin
and
had
been
sold
among
other
of
his
effects
when
he
fled
from
paris
to
vanish
for
a
brief
season
behind
the
clouds
of
public
animosity
and
to
blaze
out
again
an
elderly
phoenix
in
a
new
palace
adorned
with
new
treasures
of
art
and
industry
that
made
royal
princes
envious
angela
gazed
on
all
this
splendour
as
one
bewildered
in
front
of
that
gilded
wall
quivering
in
as
if
it
had
been
painted
upon
the
shaft
of
light
that
streamed
in
from
the
tall
window
her
fancy
pictured
the
cross
and
the
piteous
legend
lord
have
mercy
on
us
written
in
the
same
blood
colour
for
herself
she
had
neither
horror
of
the
pestilence
nor
fear
of
death
religion
had
familiarised
her
mind
with
the
image
of
the
destroyer
from
her
childhood
she
had
been
acquainted
with
the
grave
and
with
visions
of
a
world
beyond
the
grave
it
was
not
for
herself
she
trembled
but
for
her
sister
and
her
sister
children
for
lord
fareham
whose
likeness
she
recalled
even
at
this
moment
the
grave
dark
face
which
hyacinth
had
shown
her
on
the
locket
she
wore
upon
her
neck
the
face
which
sir
john
said
reminded
him
of
strafford
he
has
just
that
fatal
look
her
father
had
told
her
afterwards
when
they
talked
of
fareham
the
look
that
men
saw
in
wentworth
face
when
he
came
from
ireland
and
in
his
majesty
countenance
after
wentworth
murder
while
she
stood
in
the
dying
light
wavering
for
a
moment
doubtful
which
way
to
turn
since
the
room
had
no
less
than
three
tall
oak
doors
two
of
them
ajar
there
came
a
pattering
upon
the
polished
floor
a
scampering
of
feet
that
were
lighter
and
quicker
than
those
of
the
smallest
child
and
the
first
living
creature
angela
saw
in
that
silent
house
came
running
towards
her
it
was
only
a
little
spaniel
with
long
silky
hair
and
drooping
ears
and
great
brown
eyes
fond
and
gentle
a
very
toy
and
trifle
in
the
canine
kingdom
yet
the
sight
of
that
living
thing
thrilled
her
heart
and
her
tears
came
thick
and
fast
as
she
knelt
and
took
the
little
dog
in
her
arms
and
pressed
him
against
her
bosom
and
kissed
the
cold
muzzle
and
looked
half
laughing
half
crying
into
the
pathetic
brown
eyes
at
least
there
is
life
near
this
dog
would
not
be
left
in
a
deserted
house
she
thought
as
the
creature
trembled
against
her
bosom
and
licked
the
hand
that
held
him
the
pattering
was
repeated
in
the
adjoining
room
and
another
spaniel
which
might
have
been
twin
brother
of
the
one
she
held
came
through
the
half
open
door
and
ran
to
her
and
set
up
a
jealous
barking
which
reverberated
in
the
lofty
room
and
from
within
that
unseen
chamber
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
there
came
a
groan
a
deep
and
hollow
sound
as
of
mortal
agony
she
set
down
the
dog
in
an
instant
and
was
on
her
feet
again
trembling
but
alert
she
pushed
the
door
a
little
wider
and
went
into
the
next
apartment
a
bedroom
more
splendid
than
any
her
fancy
had
ever
depicted
when
she
read
of
royal
palaces
the
walls
were
hung
with
mortlake
tapestries
representing
in
four
great
panels
the
story
of
perseus
and
andromeda
and
the
rape
of
proserpine
to
her
who
knew
not
the
old
greek
fables
those
figures
looked
strangely
diabolical
naked
maiden
and
fiery
dragon
flying
horse
and
greek
hero
demeter
and
persephone
and
chariot
seemed
alike
demonaic
and
unholy
seen
in
the
dim
light
of
expiring
day
the
high
with
its
oriental
jars
and
amber
faced
her
as
she
entered
the
room
and
opposite
the
three
tall
windows
stood
the
state
bed
of
carved
ebony
the
posts
adorned
with
massive
bouquets
of
chased
silver
flowers
the
curtains
of
wine
coloured
velvet
heavy
with
bullion
fringes
one
curtain
had
been
looped
back
showing
the
amber
satin
lining
and
on
this
bed
of
state
lay
a
man
writhing
in
agony
with
one
bloodless
hand
plucking
at
the
cambric
upon
his
bosom
while
with
the
other
he
grasped
the
ebony
in
a
paroxysm
of
pain
angela
knew
that
dark
and
powerful
face
at
the
first
glance
though
the
features
were
distorted
by
suffering
this
sick
man
the
sole
occupant
of
a
deserted
mansion
was
her
lord
fareham
a
large
armchair
stood
beside
the
bed
and
on
this
angela
seated
herself
she
recollected
the
superior
injunction
just
in
time
to
put
one
of
the
lozenges
into
her
mouth
before
she
bent
over
the
sufferer
and
took
his
clammy
hand
in
hers
and
endured
the
acrimony
of
his
poisonous
breath
that
anxious
gaze
the
dark
yellow
complexion
and
those
great
beads
of
sweat
that
poured
down
the
pinched
countenance
too
plainly
indicated
the
disease
which
had
desolated
london
the
moslem
invisible
had
entered
this
palace
and
had
touched
the
master
with
his
deadly
lance
that
terrible
presence
which
for
the
most
part
had
been
found
among
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
was
here
amidst
purple
and
fine
linen
here
on
this
bed
of
state
enthroned
in
ebony
and
silver
hung
round
with
velvet
and
bullion
she
needed
not
to
discover
the
pestilential
spots
beneath
that
cambric
which
hung
loose
upon
the
muscular
frame
to
be
convinced
of
the
cruel
fact
here
abandoned
and
alone
lay
the
master
of
the
house
with
nothing
better
than
a
pair
of
spaniels
for
his
companions
and
neither
nurse
nor
watcher
wife
nor
friend
to
help
him
towards
recovery
or
to
comfort
his
passing
soul
one
of
the
little
dogs
leapt
on
the
bed
and
licked
his
master
face
again
and
again
whining
piteously
between
whiles
the
sick
man
looked
at
angela
with
awful
unseeing
eyes
and
then
burst
into
a
wild
laugh
see
them
run
the
he
cried
ride
after
them
mow
them
down
scatter
the
rebel
the
day
is
ours
and
then
passing
from
english
to
french
from
visions
of
lindsey
and
rupert
and
the
pursuit
at
edgehill
to
memories
of
cond√©
and
turenne
he
shouted
with
the
voice
that
was
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
monte

he
was
in
the
field
of
battle
again
his
wandering
wits
had
carried
him
back
to
his
first
fight
when
he
was
a
lad
in
his
father
company
of
horse
following
the
king
fortunes
breathing
gunpowder
and
splashed
with
human
blood
for
the
first
time
when
it
was
not
so
long
since
he
had
been
blooded
at
the
death
of
his
first
fox
he
was
a
young
man
again
with
the
prince
that
bourbon
prince
and
hero
whom
he
loved
and
honoured
far
above
any
of
his

how
last

in

these
sweats
had
not
always
pointed
to
a
fatal
result
but
in
some
cases
had
afforded
an
outlet
to
the
pestilential
influences
though
in
too
many
instances
they
had
served
only
to
enfeeble
the
patient
the
fire
of
disease
still
burning
while
the
damps
of
approaching
dissolution
oozed
from
the
fevered
body

chapter
a
ministering
angel
angela
flung
off
hood
and
mantle
and
looked
anxiously
round
the
room
there
were
some
empty
phials
and
ointment
boxes
some
soiled
linen
rags
and
wet
sponges
upon
a
table
near
the
bed
and
the
chamber
reeked
with
the
odour
of
drugs
hartshorn
and
elder
vinegar
cantharides
and
aloes
enough
to
show
that
a
doctor
had
been
there
and
that
there
had
been
some
attempt
at
nursing
the
patient
but
she
had
heard
how
in
holland
the
nurses
had
sometimes
robbed
and
abandoned
their
charges
taking
advantage
of
the
confusions
and
uncertainties
of
that
period
of
despair
quick
and
skilful
to
profit
by
sudden
death
and
the
fears
and
agonies
of
relatives
and
friends
whose
grief
made
plunder
easy
she
deemed
it
likely
that
one
of
those
devilish
women
had
first
pretended
to
succour
and
had
then
abandoned
lord
fareham
to
his
fate
after
robbing
his
house
indeed
the
open
doors
of
a
stately
inlaid
wardrobe
between
two
windows
over
against
the
bed
and
the
confused
appearance
of
the
clothes
and
linen
on
the
shelves
indicated
that
it
had
been
ransacked
by
hasty
hands
while
doubtless
there
had
been
many
valuables
lying
loose
about
a
house
where
there
was
every
indication
of
a
careless
profusion
alas
poor
gentleman
to
be
left
by
some
mercenary
wretch
left
to
die
like
the
camel
in
the
desert
she
bent
over
him
and
laid
her
hand
with
gentle
firmness
upon
his
forehead
what
are
there
saints
and
angels
in
hell
as
well
as
felons
and
devils
he
cried
clutching
her
by
the
wrist
and
looking
up
at
her
with
distended
eyes
in
which
the
natural
colour
of
the
was
tarnished
almost
to
blackness
with
injected
blood
for
long
and
lonely
hours
that
seemed
an
eternity
he
had
been
tossing
in
a
burning
fever
upon
that
disordered
bed
until
he
verily
believed
himself
in
a
place
of
everlasting
torment
he
had
that
strange
double
sense
which
goes
with
delirium
the
consciousness
of
his
real
surroundings
the
tapestry
and
furniture
of
his
own
chamber
and
yet
the
conviction
that
this
was
hell
and
had
always
been
hell
and
that
he
had
descended
to
this
terrible
through
infinite
abysses
of
darkness
the
glow
of
sunset
had
been
to
him
the
fierce
light
of
everlasting
flames
the
burning
of
fever
was
the
fire
that
is
never
quenched
the
pain
that
racked
his
limbs
was
the
worm
that
dieth
not
and
now
in
his
torment
there
came
the
vision
of
a
seraphic
face
bending
over
him
in
gentle
solicitude
a
face
that
brought
comfort
with
it
even
in
the
midst
of
his
agony
after
that
one
wild
question
he
sank
slowly
back
upon
the
pillows
and
lay
faint
and
weak
his
breathing
scarce
audible
angela
laid
her
fingers
on
his
wrist
the
pulse
was
fluttering
and
intermittent
she
remembered
every
detail
of
her
aunt
treatment
of
the
in
the
convent
infirmary
and
how
the
of
the
malady
and
beginning
of
cure
had
seemed
to
be
brought
about
by
a
draught
of
strong
wine
which
the
reverend
mother
had
made
her
give
the
poor
fainting
creature
at
a
crisis
of
extreme
weakness
she
looked
about
the
room
for
any
flask
which
might
contain
wine
but
there
was
nothing
there
except
the
apothecary
phials
and
medicaments
it
was
dusk
already
and
she
was
alone
in
a
strange
house
it
would
seem
no
easy
task
to
find
what
she
wanted
but
the
case
was
desperate
and
she
knew
enough
of
this
mysterious
disease
to
know
that
if
the
patient
could
not
rally
speedily
from
his
prostrate
condition
the
end
must
be
near
with
steady
brain
she
set
herself
to
face
the
difficulty
first
to
administer
something
which
should
sustain
the
sick
man
strength
and
then
without
loss
of
time
to
seek
a
physician
and
bring
him
to
that
deserted
bed
wine
was
the
one
thing
she
could
trust
to
in
this
crisis
for
of
the
doses
and
lotions
on
yonder
table
she
knew
nothing
nor
had
her
experience
made
her
a
believer
in
the
happy
influence
of
drugs
her
first
search
must
be
for
light
with
which
to
explore
the
lower
part
of
the
house
where
in
pantry
or
stillroom
or
if
not
above
ground
in
the
cellars
she
must
find
what
she
wanted
surely
somewhere
in
that
spacious
there
would
be
and
matches
there
were
a
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
on
the
with
thick
wax
candles
burnt
nearly
to
the
sockets
a
careful
search
at
last
discovered
a
and
matches
in
a
dark
angle
of
the
fireless
hearth
hidden
behind
the
heavy
iron
dog
she
struck
a
light
kindled
her
match
and
lighted
a
candle
the
sick
man
eyes
following
all
her
movements
but
his
lips
mute
as
she
went
out
of
the
door
he
called
after
her
leave
me
not
thou
holy
visitant
leave
not
my
soul
in
hell
i
will
return
she
cried
have
no
fear
sir
i
go
to
fetch
some
wine
her
errand
was
not
done
quickly
amidst
all
the
magnificence
she
had
noted
on
her
journey
through
the
long
suite
of
the
littered
treasures
of
amber
and
gold
and
ivory
and
porcelain
and
silver
she
had
seen
only
an
empty
so
with
quick
footfall
she
ran
down
the
wide
shallow
stairs
to
the
lower
floor
and
here
she
found
herself
in
a
labyrinth
of
passages
opening
into
small
rooms
and
servants
offices
here
there
were
darkness
and
gloom
rather
than
splendour
though
in
many
of
those
smaller
rooms
there
was
a
sober
and
substantial
luxury
which
became
the
inferior
apartments
of
a
palace
she
came
at
last
to
a
room
which
she
took
to
be
the
butler
office
where
there
were
dressers
with
a
great
array
of
costly
venetian
glass
and
a
great
many
pieces
of
silver
cups
tankards
salvers
and
other
ornamental
plate
in
presses
behind
glazed
doors
one
of
the
glass
panels
had
been
broken
and
the
shelves
in
that
press
were
empty
wine
there
was
none
to
be
found
in
any
part
of
the
room
but
a
small
army
of
empty
bottles
in
a
corner
of
the
floor
and
a
confusion
of
greasy
plates
knives
chicken
bones
and
other
scraps
indicated
that
there
had
been
carousing
here
at
no
remote
time
the
cellars
were
doubtless
below
these
offices
but
the
would
assuredly
be
locked
and
she
had
to
search
for
the
keys
she
opened
drawer
after
drawer
in
the
lower
part
of
the
presses
and
at
last
in
an
inner
and
secret
drawer
found
a
multitude
of
keys
some
of
which
were
provided
with
parchment
labels
and
among
these
happily
were
two
labelled
ye
great
wine
cellar
and
ye
smaller
wine
cellar
this
was
a
point
gained
but
the
search
had
occupied
a
considerable
time
she
had
yet
enough
candle
to
last
for
about
half
an
hour
and
her
next
business
was
to
find
one
of
those
cellars
which
those
keys
opened
she
was
intensely
anxious
to
return
to
her
patient
having
heard
how
in
some
cases
unhappy
wretches
had
leapt
from
the
bed
of
death
and
rushed
delirious
half
naked
to
anticipate
their
end
by
a
fatal
chill
on
her
way
to
the
butler
office
she
had
seen
a
stone
archway
at
the
head
of
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
down
into
darkness
by
this
staircase
she
hoped
to
find
the
and
presently
descended
her
candlestick
in
one
hand
and
the
two
great
keys
in
the
other
as
she
went
down
into
the
stone
basement
which
was
built
with
the
solidity
of
a
dungeon
she
heard
the
plash
of
the
tide
and
felt
that
she
was
now
on
a
level
with
the
river
here
she
found
herself
again
in
a
labyrinth
of
passages
with
many
doors
standing
ajar
at
the
end
of
one
passage
she
came
to
a
locked
door
and
on
trying
her
keys
found
one
of
them
to
fit
the
lock
it
was
ye
great
wine
cellar
and
she
understood
by
the
initial
that
the
cellar
looked
south
and
faced
the
river
she
turned
the
heavy
key
with
an
effort
that
strained
the
slender
fingers
which
held
it
but
she
was
unconscious
of
the
pain
and
wondered
afterwards
to
see
her
hand
dented
and
bruised
where
the
iron
had
wrung
it
the
clumsy
door
revolved
on
massive
hinges
and
she
entered
a
cellar
so
large
that
the
light
of
her
candle
did
not
reach
the
furthermost
corners
and
recesses
this
cellar
was
built
in
a
series
of
arches
fitted
with
stone
bins
and
in
the
upper
part
of
one
arch
there
was
a
narrow
grating
through
which
came
the
cool
breath
of
evening
air
and
the
sound
of
water
lapping
against
stone
a
patch
of
faint
light
showed
pale
against
the
iron
bars
and
as
angela
looked
that
way
a
great
grey
rat
leapt
through
the
grating
and
ran
along
the
topmost
bin
making
the
bottles
shiver
as
he
scuttled
across
them
then
came
a
thud
on
the
stones
and
she
knew
that
the
loathsome
thing
was
on
the
floor
upon
which
she
was
standing
she
lowered
her
light
shudderingly
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
entered
that
house
of
dread
the
young
brave
heart
sank
with
the
sickness
of
fear
the
cellar
might
swarm
with
such
creatures
the
darkness
of
the
night
might
be
alive
with
them
and
if
yonder
door
were
to
swing
to
and
shut
with
a
spring
lock
she
might
perish
there
in
the
darkness
she
might
die
the
most
hideous
of
deaths
and
her
fate
remain
for
ever
unknown
in
a
sudden
panic
she
rushed
back
to
the
door
and
pushed
it
wider
pushed
it
to
its
extremest
opening
it
seemed
too
heavy
to
be
likely
to
swing
back
upon
its
hinges
yet
the
mere
idea
of
such
a
contingency
appalled
her
remembering
her
labour
in
unlocking
the
door
from
the
outside
she
doubted
if
she
could
open
it
from
within
were
it
once
to
close
upon
that
awful
vault
and
all
this
time
the
lapping
of
the
tide
against
the
stone
sounded
louder
and
she
saw
little
spirts
of
spray
flashing
against
the
bars
in
the
lessening
light
she
collected
herself
with
an
effort
and
began
her
search
for
the
wine
sack
was
the
wine
she
had
given
to
the
sick
nun
and
it
was
that
wine
for
which
she
looked
of
burgundy
and
claret
labelled
clary
wine
she
found
several
full
bins
and
more
that
were
nearly
empty
tokay
and
other
rarer
wines
were
denoted
by
the
parchment
labels
which
hung
above
each
bin
but
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
came
to
a
bin
labelled
sherris
which
she
knew
was
another
name
for
sack
the
bottles
had
evidently
been
undisturbed
for
a
long
time
for
the
bin
was
full
of
cobweb
and
the
thick
coating
of
dust
upon
the
glass
betokened
a
respectable
age
in
the
wine
she
carried
off
two
bottles
one
under
each
arm
and
then
with
even
quicker
steps
than
had
brought
her
to
that
darksome
place
she
hastened
back
to
the
upper
floor
leaving
the
key
in
the
cellar
door
and
the
door
unlocked
there
would
be
time
enough
to
look
after
lord
fareham
wine
when
she
had
cared
for
lord
fareham
himself
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
doorway
as
she
entered
they
shone
upon
her
in
the
dusk
with
an
awful
glassiness
as
if
life
last
look
had
become
fixed
in
death
he
did
not
speak
as
she
drew
near
the
bed
and
set
the
wine
bottles
down
upon
the
table
among
the
drugs
and
cataplasms
she
had
found
a
corkscrew
in
the
butler
room
among
the
relics
of
the
feast
and
with
this
she
opened
one
of
the
bottles
fareham
watching
her
all
the
time
is
that
some
new
alexipharmic
he
asked
with
a
sudden
rational
air
which
was
almost
as
startling
as
if
a
dead
man
had
spoken
i
will
have
no
more
of
their
loathsome
drugs
they
have
made
an
apothecary
shop
of
my
body
i
would
rather
they
let
me
rot
by
the
plague
than
that
they
should
poison
me
with
their
antidotes
or
dissolve
me
to
death
with
their
sudorifics
this
is
not
a
medicine
lord
fareham
but
your
own
wine
and
i
want
you
to
drink
a
long
draught
of
it
and
then
who
knows
but
you
may
sleep
off
your
malady
ay
sleep
in
the
grave
sweet
friend
i
have
seen
the
tokens
on
my
breast
that
mean
death
there
is
but
one
inevitable
end
for
all
who
are
so
marked
is
like
the
forester
notch
upon
the
tree
it
means
doom
he
was
king
of
the
forest
once
perhaps
but
no
matter
his
time
has
come
oh
lord
thou
hast
tormented
me
with
hot
burning
coals
he
cried
in
a
sudden
access
of
pain
and
in
the
next
minute
he
was
raving
angela
filled
a
beaker
with
the
bright
golden
wine
and
offered
it
to
the
sick
man
lips
it
was
not
without
infinite
pains
and
coaxing
that
she
induced
him
to
drink
but
when
once
his
parched
lips
had
tasted
the
cold
liquor
he
drank
eagerly
as
if
that
strong
wine
had
been
a
draught
of
water
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
solace
when
the
beaker
was
empty
for
he
had
been
enduring
an
agony
of
thirst
through
all
the
glare
and
heat
of
the
afternoon
and
there
was
unspeakable
comfort
in
that
first
long
drink
he
would
have
drunk
foul
water
with
almost
as
keen
a
relish
he
talked
fast
and
furiously
in
the
disjointed
sentences
of
delirium
for
some
little
time
and
then
little
by
little
he
grew
more
tranquil
and
angela
sitting
beside
the
bed
with
her
fingers
laid
gently
on
his
wrist
marked
the
quieter
beat
of
the
pulse
which
no
longer
fluttered
like
the
wing
of
a
frightened
bird
then
with
deep
thankfulness
she
saw
the
eyelids
droop
over
the
bloodshot
eyeballs
while
the
breathing
grew
slower
and
heavier
as
sleep
clouded
the
wearied
brain
the
spaniels
crept
nearer
him
and
nestled
close
to
his
pillow
so
that
the
man
dark
locks
were
mixed
with
the
silken
curls
of
the
dogs
would
he
die
in
that
sleep
she
wondered
it
was
only
now
for
the
first
time
since
she
entered
this
unpeopled
house
that
she
had
leisure
to
speculate
on
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
about
such
loneliness
and
neglect
here
where
rank
and
state
and
wealth
almost
without
limit
should
have
secured
the
patient
every
care
and
comfort
that
devoted
service
could
lavish
upon
a
sufferer
how
was
it
that
she
found
her
sister
husband
abandoned
to
the
care
of
hirelings
left
to
the
chances
of
paid
service
to
the
maiden
the
idea
of
wifely
duty
was
elevated
almost
to
a
religion
to
father
or
to
husband
she
would
have
given
a
boundless
devotion
in
sickness
most
of
all
devoted
to
leave
husband
or
father
in
a
city
would
have
seemed
to
her
a
crime
as
abominable
as
tullia
a
treachery
base
as
goneril
or
regan
could
it
be
that
her
sister
that
bright
and
lovely
creature
whose
face
she
remembered
as
a
sunbeam
incarnate
could
she
have
been
swept
away
by
the
pestilence
which
spared
neither
youth
nor
beauty
neither
the
strong
man
nor
the
weakling
child
her
heart
grew
heavy
as
lead
at
the
thought
that
this
stranger
by
whose
pillow
she
was
watching
might
be
the
sole
survivor
in
that
forsaken
palace
and
that
in
a
few
more
hours
he
too
would
be
numbered
with
the
dead
in
that
dreadful
city
where
death
reigned
omnipotent
and
where
the
living
seemed
but
a
vanishing
minority
pale
shadows
of
living
creatures
passing
silently
along
one
inevitable
pathway
to
the
or
pit
that
calm
sleep
of
the
might
mean
recovery
or
it
might
mean
death
angela
examined
the
potions
and
unguents
on
the
table
near
the
bed
and
read
the
instructions
on
jars
and
phials
one
was
an
alexipharmic
draught
to
be
taken
the
last
thing
at
night
another
a
sudorific
to
be
administered
once
in
every
hour
i
would
not
wake
him
to
give
him
the
finest
medicine
that
ever
physician
prescribed
angela
said
to
herself
i
remember
what
a
happy
change
one
hour
of
quiet
slumber
made
in
sister
monica
when
she
was
all
but
dead
of
a
quartan
fever
sleep
is
god
physic
she
knelt
upon
a
chair
remote
from
the
bed
knowing
that
contagion
lurked
amid
those
voluminous
hangings
beneath
that
stately
canopy
with
its
lustrous
satin
lining
on
which
the
light
of
the
wax
candles
was
reflected
in
shining
patches
as
upon
a
lake
of
golden
water
she
had
no
fear
of
the
pestilence
but
an
instinctive
prudence
made
her
hold
herself
aloof
now
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
for
the
sufferer
she
remained
long
in
prayer
repeating
one
of
those
litanies
which
she
had
learnt
in
her
infancy
and
which
of
late
had
seemed
to
her
to
have
somewhat
too
set
and
mechanical
a
rhythm
the
earnestness
and
fervour
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
them
in
somewise
since
she
had
come
to
womanhood
the
names
of
the
saints
her
lips
invoked
were
dull
and
cold
and
evolved
no
image
of
human
or
superhuman
love
and
power
what
need
of
intercessors
whose
personality
was
vague
and
dim
whose
earthly
histories
were
made
up
of
truth
so
interwoven
with
fable
that
she
scarce
dared
believe
even
that
which
might
be
true
in
the
one
crucified
was
help
for
all
sinners
gospel
and
creed
the
rule
of
life
here
the
promise
of
immortality
hereafter
the
litanies
to
virgin
and
saints
were
said
as
a
duty
a
part
of
implicit
obedience
which
was
the
groundwork
of
her
religion
and
then
all
the
aspirations
of
her
heart
her
prayers
for
the
sick
man
yonder
her
fears
for
her
absent
sister
for
her
father
in
his
foreign
wanderings
went
up
in
one
stream
of
invocation
to
christ
the
redeemer
to
him
and
him
alone
the
strong
flame
of
faith
and
love
rose
like
the
incense
upon
an
altar
the
altar
of
a
girl
trusting
heart
she
was
so
lost
in
meditation
that
she
was
unconscious
of
an
approaching
footstep
in
the
stillness
of
the
deserted
house
till
it
drew
near
to
the
threshold
of
the
the
night
was
close
and
sultry
so
she
had
left
the
door
open
and
that
slow
tread
had
crossed
the
threshold
by
the
time
she
rose
from
her
knees
her
heart
beat
fast
startled
by
the
first
human
presence
which
she
had
known
in
that
melancholy
place
save
the
presence
of
the
sufferer
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
gentleman
of
medium
stature
clad
in
the
sober
colouring
that
suggested
one
of
the
learned
professions
he
appeared
even
more
startled
than
angela
at
the
unexpected
vision
which
met
his
gaze
faintly
seen
in
the
dim
light
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
then
the
stranger
saluted
the
lady
with
a
formal
reverence
as
he
laid
down
his
cane
surely
madam
this
mansion
of
my
lord
fareham
must
be
enchanted
he
said
i
left
a
crowd
of
attendants
and
the
stir
of
life
below
and
above
stairs
only
this
forenoon
last
past
i
find
silence
and
vacancy
that
is
scarce
strange
in
this
dejected
and
unhappy
time
for
it
is
but
too
common
a
trick
of
hireling
nurses
to
abandon
their
patients
and
for
servants
to
plunder
and
then
desert
a
sick
house
but
to
find
an
angel
where
i
left
a
hag
that
is
the
miracle
and
an
angel
who
has
brought
healing
if
i
mistake
not
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
bending
over
the
speaker
i
am
no
angel
sir
but
a
weak
erring
mortal
answered
the
girl
gravely
for
pity
sake
kind
doctor
since
i
doubt
not
you
are
my
physician
tell
me
where
are
my
dearest
sister
lady
fareham
and
her
children
tell
me
the
worst
i
entreat
you
sweet
lady
there
is
no
ill
news
to
tell
her
ladyship
and
the
little
ones
are
safe
at
my
lord
house
in
oxfordshire
and
it
is
only
his
lordship
yonder
who
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
contagion
lady
fareham
and
her
girl
and
boy
have
not
been
in
london
since
the
plague
began
to
rage
my
lord
had
business
in
the
city
and
came
hither
alone
he
and
the
young
lord
rochester
who
is
the
most
audacious
infidel
this
town
can
show
have
been
bidding
defiance
to
the
pestilence
deeming
their
nobility
safe
from
a
sickness
which
has
for
the
most
part
chosen
its
victims
among
the
vulgar
his
lordship
is
very
ill
i
fear
sir
said
angela
interrogatively
i
left
him
at
eleven
this
morning
with
but
scanty
hope
of
finding
him
alive
after
sundown
the
woman
i
left
to
nurse
him
was
his
wife
and
far
above
the
common
kind
of
i
did
not
think
she
would
turn
traitor
her
husband
has
proved
a
false
steward
the
house
has
been
robbed
of
plate
and
valuables
as
i
believe
from
signs
i
saw
below
stairs
and
i
suppose
husband
and
wife
went
off
together
alack
madam
this
pestilence
has
brought
into
play
some
of
the
worst
attributes
of
human
nature
the
tokens
and
loathly
boils
which
break
out
upon
the
flesh
of
the
are
less
revolting
to
humanity
than
the
cruelty
of
those
who
minister
to
the
sick
and
whose
only
desire
is
to
profit
by
the
miseries
that
surround
them
wretches
so
vile
that
they
have
been
known
wilfully
to
convey
the
seeds
of
death
from
house
to
house
in
order
to
infect
the
sound
and
so
enlarge
their
area
of
gains
it
was
an
artful
device
of
those
plunderers
to
paint
the
red
cross
on
the
door
and
thus
scare
away
any
visitor
who
might
have
discovered
their
depredations
but
you
madam
a
being
so
young
and
fragile
have
you
no
fear
of
the
contagion
nay
sir
i
know
that
i
am
in
god
hand
yonder
poor
gentleman
is
not
the
first
i
have
nursed
there
was
a
nun
came
from
holland
to
our
convent
at
louvain
last
year
and
had
scarce
been
one
night
in
the
house
before
tokens
of
the
pestilence
were
discovered
upon
her
i
helped
the
infirmarian
to
nurse
her
and
with
god
help
we
brought
her
round
my
aunt
the
reverend
mother
bade
me
give
her
the
best
wine
there
was
in
the
house
strong
spanish
wine
that
a
rich
merchant
had
given
to
the
convent
for
the
use
of
the
sick
and
it
was
as
though
that
good
wine
drove
the
poison
from
her
blood
she
recovered
by
the
grace
of
god
after
only
a
few
days
careful
nursing
finding
his
lordship
stricken
with
such
great
weakness
i
ventured
to
give
him
a
draught
of
the
best
sack
i
could
find
in
his
cellar
dear
lady
thou
art
a
miracle
of
good
sense
and
compassionate
bounty
i
doubt
thou
hast
saved
thy
sister
from
widow
weeds
said
hodgkin
seated
by
the
bed
with
his
fingers
on
the
patient
wrist
and
his
massive
gold
watch
in
the
other
hand
this
sound
sleep
promises
well
and
the
pulse
beats
somewhat
slower
and
steadier
than
it
did
this
morning
then
the
case
seemed
hopeless
and
i
feared
to
give
wine
though
a
free
use
of
generous
wine
is
my
particular
treatment
lest
it
should
fly
to
his
brain
and
disturb
his
intellectuals
at
a
time
when
he
should
need
all
his
senses
for
the
final
disposition
of
his
affairs
great
estates
sometimes
hang
upon
the
breath
of
a
dying
man
oh
sir
but
your
patient
to
save
his
life
that
would
sure
be
your
first
and
chiefest
thought
ay
ay
my
pretty
miss
but
i
had
other
measures
apollo
twangs
not
ever
on
the
same
bowstring
did
my
sudorific
work
well
think
you
he
was
bathed
in
perspiration
when
first
i
found
him
but
the
seemed
cold
and
deadly
as
if
life
itself
were
being
dissolved
out
of
him
ay
there
are
cases
in
which
that
copious
sweat
is
the
forerunner
of
dissolution
but
in
others
it
augurs
cure
the
poison
which
is
corrupting
the
patient
blood
finds
a
sudden
vent
its
virulence
is
diluted
and
if
the
end
prove
fatal
it
is
that
the
patient
lacks
power
to
rally
after
the
ravages
of
the
disease
rather
than
that
the
poison
kills
was
it
instantly
after
that
profuse
sweat
you
gave
him
the
wine
i
wonder
it
was
as
speedily
as
i
could
procure
it
from
the
cellar
below
and
that
strong
wine
given
in
the
nick
of
time
reassembled
scattered
forces
and
rekindled
the
flame
of
life
upon
my
soul
sweet
young
lady
i
believe
thou
hast
saved
him
all
the
drugs
in
bucklersbury
could
do
no
more
and
now
tell
me
what
symptoms
you
have
noted
since
you
have
watched
by
his
bed
and
tell
me
further
if
you
have
strength
to
continue
his
nurse
with
such
precautions
as
i
shall
dictate
and
such
help
as
i
can
send
you
in
the
shape
of
a
stout
honest
of
mine
and
a
man
to
guard
the
lower
part
of
your
house
and
fetch
and
carry
for
you
i
will
do
everything
you
bid
me
with
all
my
heart
and
with
such
skill
as
i
can
command
those
delicate
fingers
were
formed
to
minister
to
the
sick
and
you
will
not
shrink
from
loathsome
offices
from
the
application
of
cataplasms
from
cleansing
foul
sores
those
blains
and
boils
upon
that
poor
body
will
need
care
for
many
days
to
come
i
will
shrink
from
nothing
that
may
be
needful
for
his
benefit
i
should
love
to
go
on
nursing
him
were
it
only
for
my
sister
sake
how
sorry
she
would
feel
to
be
so
far
from
him
could
she
but
know
of
his
sickness
yes
i
believe
lady
fareham
would
be
sorry
answered
the
physician
with
a
dry
little
laugh
though
there
are
not
many
married
ladies
about
rowley
court
of
whom
i
would
diagnose
as
much
not
lady
denham
for
instance
that
handsome
unprincipled
houri
married
to
a
septuagenarian
poet
who
would
rather
lock
her
up
in
a
garret
than
see
her
shine
at
whitehall
or
lady
castlemaine
whose
husband
has
been
uncivil
enough
to
show
discontent
at
a
peerage
that
was
not
of
his
own
earning
or
a
dozen
others
i
could
name
were
not
such
scandals
as
these
hebrew
to
thine
innocent
ear
nay
sir
my
sister
has
written
of
court
scandals
in
many
of
her
letters
and
it
has
grieved
me
to
think
her
lot
should
be
cast
among
people
of
whose
reckless
doings
she
tells
me
with
a
lively
wit
that
makes
sin
seem
something
less
than
sin
there
is
no
such
word
as
in
charles
stuart
court
my
dear
young
lady
it
is
harder
to
achieve
bad
repute
nowadays
than
it
was
once
to
be
thought
a
saint
existence
in
this
town
is
a
succession
of
bagatelles
men
lives
and
women
reputations
drift
down
to
the
bottomless
pit
upon
a
rivulet
of
epigrams
and
chansons
you
have
heard
of
that
dance
of
death
which
was
one
of
the
nervous
diseases
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
malady
which
after
beginning
with
one
lively
caperer
would
infect
a
whole
townspeople
and
send
an
entire
population
curvetting
and
prancing
until
death
stopped
them
i
sometimes
think
when
i
watch
the
follies
at
whitehall
that
those
graceful
dancers
sliding
upon
pointed
toe
through
a
coranto
amid
a
blaze
of
candles
and
of
diamonds
are
capering
along
the
same
fatal
road
by
which
vitus
lured
his
votaries
to
the
grave
and
then
i
look
at
rowley
licentious
eye
and
cynical
lip
and
think
to
myself
man
father
perished
on
the
scaffold
this
lovely
ancestress
paid
the
penalty
of
her
manifold
treacheries
after
sixteen
years
imprisonment
this
man
has
passed
through
the
jaws
of
death
has
left
his
country
a
fugitive
and
a
pauper
has
returned
as
if
by
a
miracle
carried
back
to
a
throne
upon
the
hearts
of
his
people
and
behold
him
now
saunterer
sybarite
sensualist
strolling
through
life
without
one
noble
aim
or
one
virtuous
instinct
a
king
who
traffics
in
the
pride
and
honour
of
his
country
and
would
sell
her
most
precious
possessions
level
her
strongest
defences
if
his
cousin
and
patron
side
the
channel
would
but
bid
high
enough
but
a
plague
on
my
tongue
dear
lady
that
it
must
always
be
wagging
not
one
word
more
save
for
instructions
hodgkin
loved
talking
even
better
than
he
loved
a
fee
and
he
allowed
himself
a
physician
licence
to
be
prosy
but
he
now
proceeded
to
give
minute
directions
for
the
treatment
of
the
patient
the
poultices
and
stoups
and
lotions
which
were
to
reduce
the
external
indications
of
the
contagion
the
medicines
which
were
to
be
given
at
intervals
during
the
night
medicine
in
those
days
left
very
little
to
nature
and
if
patients
perished
it
was
seldom
for
want
of
drugs
and
medicaments
the
servant
i
send
you
will
bring
meat
and
all
needful
herbs
for
making
a
strong
broth
with
which
you
will
feed
the
patient
once
an
hour
there
are
many
who
hold
with
the
boiling
of
gold
in
such
a
broth
but
i
will
not
enter
upon
the
merits
of
aurum
potabile
as
a
fortifiant
i
take
it
that
in
this
case
you
will
find
beef
and
mutton
serve
your
turn
i
shall
send
you
from
my
own
larder
as
much
beef
as
will
suffice
for
use
and
your
servant
must
go
to
the
place
where
the
country
people
sell
their
goods
butchers
meat
poultry
and
for
the
shops
of
london
are
nearly
all
closed
and
people
scent
contagion
in
any
intercourse
with
their
you
will
have
therefore
to
look
to
the
country
people
for
your
supplies
but
of
all
this
my
own
man
will
give
you
information
so
now
good
night
sweet
young
lady
it
is
on
the
stroke
of
nine
before
eleven
you
shall
have
those
who
will
help
and
protect
you
meanwhile
you
had
best
go
downstairs
with
me
and
lock
and
bolt
the
great
door
leading
into
the
garden
which
i
found
ajar
there
is
the
door
facing
the
river
too
by
which
i
entered
ay
that
should
be
barred
also
keep
a
good
heart
madam
before
eleven
you
shall
have
a
sturdy
watchman
on
the
premises
angela
took
a
lighted
candle
and
followed
the
physician
through
the
great
empty
rooms
and
down
the
echoing
staircase
under
the
ceiling
where
jove
with
upraised
goblet
drank
to
his
queen
while
all
the
galaxy
of
the
greek
pantheon
circled
his
imperial
throne
upon
how
many
a
festal
procession
had
those
olympians
looked
down
since
that
famous
when
the
colours
were
fresh
from
the
painter
brush
and
when
the
third
lord
fareham
friend
and
gossip
king
james
deigned
to
witness
the
representation
of
jonson
time
vindicated
enacted
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
quality
in
the
great
saloon
a
performance
which
with
the
banquet

down

was
present
at
that
splendid
entertainment
and
the
on
the
river
cost
his
lordship
a
year
income
but
stamped
him
at
once
a
fine
gentleman
had
he
been
a
trifle
handsomer
and
somewhat
softer
of
speech
that
masque
and
banquet
might
have
placed
richard
revel
baron
fareham
in
the
front
rank
of
royal
favourites
but
the
revels
were
always
a
race
with
more
force
than
comeliness
in
their
countenances
and
more
gall
than
honey
upon
their
tongues
it
was
past
eleven
before
the
expected
succour
arrived
and
in
the
interval
lord
fareham
had
awakened
once
and
had
swallowed
a
composing
draught
having
apparently
but
little
consciousness
of
the
hand
that
administered
it
at
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
angela
heard
the
bell
ring
and
ran
blithely
down
the
now
familiar
staircase
to
open
the
garden
door
outside
which
she
found
a
woman
and
a
tall
sturdy
young
man
each
carrying
a
bundle
these
were
the
nurse
and
the
watchman
sent
by
hodgkin
the
woman
gave
angela
a
slip
of
paper
from
the
doctor
by
way
of
introduction
you
will
find
bridget
basset
a
worthy
woman
and
able
to
turn
her
hand
to
anything
and
thomas
stokes
is
an
honest
serviceable
youth
whom
you
may
trust
upon
the
premises
till
some
of
his
lordship
servants
can
be
sent
from
chilton
abbey
where
i
take
it
there
is
a
large
staff
it
was
with
an
unspeakable
relief
that
angela
welcomed
these
humble
friends
the
silence
of
the
great
empty
house
had
been
weighing
upon
her
spirits
until
the
sense
of
solitude
and
helplessness
had
grown
almost
unbearable
again
and
again
she
had
watched
lord
fareham
turn
his
feverish
head
upon
his
pillow
while
the
parched
lips
moved
in
inarticulate
mutterings
and
she
had
thought
of
what
she
should
do
if
a
stronger
delirium
were
to
possess
him
and
he
were
to
try
and
do
himself
some
mischief
if
he
were
to
start
up
from
his
bed
and
rush
through
the
empty
rooms
or
burst
open
one
of
yonder
lofty
casements
and
fling
himself
headlong
to
the
terrace
below
she
had
been
told
of
the
terrible
things
that
had
done
to
themselves
in
their
agony
how
they
had
run
naked
into
the
streets
to
perish
on
the
stones
of
the
highway
how
they
had
gashed
themselves
with
knives
or
set
fire
to
their
seeking
any
escape
from
the
torments
of
that
foul
disease
she
knew
that
those
burning
which
her
hands
had
dressed
must
cause
a
continual
anguish
that
might
wear
out
the
patience
of
a
saint
and
as
the
dark
face
turned
on
the
tumbled
pillow
she
saw
by
the
clenched
teeth
and
writhing
lips
and
the
convulsive
frown
of
the
strongly
marked
brows
that
even
in
delirium
the
sufferer
was
struggling
to
restrain
all
unmanly
expressions
of
his
agony
but
now
at
least
there
would
be
this
strong
capable
woman
to
share
in
the
long
night
watch
and
if
the
patient
grew
desperate
there
would
be
three
pair
of
hands
to
protect
him
from
his
own
fury
she
made
her
arrangements
promptly
and
decisively
basset
was
to
stay
all
night
with
her
in
the
patient
chamber
with
such
needful
intervals
of
rest
as
each
might
take
without
leaving
the
and
stokes
was
first
to
see
to
the
fastening
of
the
various
basement
doors
and
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
no
one
hidden
either
in
the
cellars
or
on
the
ground
floor
also
to
examine
all
upper
chambers
and
lock
all
doors
and
was
then
to
make
himself
a
bed
in
a
dressing
closet
adjoining
lord
chamber
and
was
to
lie
there
in
his
clothes
ready
to
help
at
any
hour
of
the
night
should
help
be
wanted
chapter
vi
between
london
and
oxford
three
nights
and
days
had
gone
since
angela
first
set
her
foot
upon
the
threshold
of
fareham
house
and
in
all
that
time
she
had
not
once
gone
out
into
the
great
city
where
dismal
silence
reigned
by
day
and
night
save
for
the
hideous
cries
of
the
men
with
the
calling
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
infected
houses
to
bring
out
their
dead
and
roaring
their
awful
summons
with
as
automatic
a
monotony
as
if
they
had
been
hawking
some
common
necessary
of
life
a
dismal
cry
that
was
but
occasionally
varied
by
the
hollow
tones
of
a
puritan
fanatic
stalking
gaunt
and
half
clad
along
the
strand
and
shouting
some
sentence
of
fatal
bodement
from
the
hebrew
prophets
just
as
before
the
siege
of
titus
there
walked
through
the
streets
of
jerusalem
one
who
cried
woe
to
the
wicked
city
and
whose
voice
could
not
be
stopped
but
by
death
in
those
three
days
and
nights
the
worst
symptoms
of
the
contagion
were
subjugated
but
the
ravages
of
the
disease
had
left
the
patient
in
a
state
of
weakness
which
bordered
on
death
and
his
nurses
were
full
of
apprehension
lest
the
shattered
forces
of
his
constitution
should
fail
even
in
the
hour
of
recovery
the
violence
of
the
fever
was
abated
and
the
delirium
had
become
intermittent
while
there
were
hours
in
which
the
sufferer
was
conscious
and
reasonable
in
which
calmer
intervals
he
would
fain
have
talked
with
angela
more
than
her
anxiety
would
allow
he
was
full
of
wonder
at
her
presence
in
that
house
and
when
he
had
been
told
who
she
was
he
wanted
to
know
how
and
why
she
had
come
there
by
what
happy
accident
by
what
interposition
of
providence
had
she
been
sent
to
save
him
from
a
hideous
death
i
should
have
died
but
for
you
he
said
i
should
have
lain
here
till
the
cart
fetched
my
putrid
carcase
i
should
be
rotting
in
one
of
their
yonder
behind
the
old
abbey
nay
indeed
my
lord
your
good
doctor
would
have
discovered
your
desolate
condition
and
would
have
brought
basset
to
nurse
you
he
would
have
been
too
late
i
was
drifting
out
to
the
dark
sea
of
death
i
felt
as
if
the
river
were
bearing
me
so
much
nearer
to
that
unknown
sea
with
every
ripple
of
the
hurrying
tide
was
your
draught
of
strong
wine
snatched
me
back
from
the
cruel
river
drew
me
on
to
again
renewed
my
consciousness
of
manhood
and
that
i
was
not
a
weed
to
be
washed
away
oh
that
wine
ye
gods
what
elixir
to
this
parched
burning
throat
did
ever
drunkard
in
all
alsatia
snatch
such
fierce
joy
from
a
brimmer
angela
put
her
finger
on
her
lip
and
with
the
other
hand
drew
the
silken
coverlet
over
the
sick
man
shoulders
you
are
not
to
talk
she
said
you
are
to
sleep
slumber
is
to
be
your
diet
and
medicine
after
that
good
soup
at
which
you
make
such
a
wry
face
i
would
swallow
the
stuff
were
it
locusta
for
your
sake
you
will
take
it
for
wisdom
sake
that
you
may
mend
speedily
and
go
home
to
my
sister
said
angela
home
yes
it
will
be
bliss
ineffable
to
see
flowery
pastures
and
wooded
hills
after
this
town
but
oh
angela
mine
angel
why
dost
thou
linger
in
this
poisonous
chamber
where
every
breath
of
mine
exhales
infection
why
do
you
not
fly
while
you
are
still
unstricken
truly
the
cometh
as
a
thief
in
the
night
you
are
safe
you
may
be
doomed
i
have
no
fear
sir
you
are
not
the
first
i
have
nursed
and
thou
fanciest
thyself
sweet
girl
it
may
be
that
the
divine
lymph
which
fills
those
azure
veins
has
no
affinity
with
poisons
that
slay
rude
mortals
like
myself
will
you
ever
be
talking
she
said
with
grave
reproach
and
left
him
to
the
care
of
basset
whose
comfortable
and
stolid
personality
did
not
stimulate
his
imagination
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
explore
that
city
of
which
she
had
yet
seen
so
little
and
her
patient
being
now
arrived
at
a
state
of
his
disorder
when
it
was
best
for
him
to
be
tempted
to
prolonged
slumbers
by
silence
and
solitude
she
put
on
her
hood
and
gloves
and
went
out
alone
to
see
the
horrors
of
the
deserted
streets
of
which
nurse
basset
had
given
her
so
appalling
a
picture
it
was
four
and
the
afternoon
was
at
its
hottest
the
blue
of
a
cloudless
sky
was
reflected
in
the
blue
of
the
silent
river
where
instead
of
the
flotilla
of
gaily
painted
wherries
the
procession
of
gilded
barges
the
music
and
song
the
ceaseless
traffic
of
court
and
city
there
was
only
the
faint
ripple
of
the
stream
or
here
and
there
a
solitary
barge
creeping
slowly
down
the
tide
with
ineffectual
sail
napping
in
the
sultry
atmosphere
that
unusual
calm
which
had
marked
this
year
from
the
beginning
of
spring
was
yet
unbroken
and
the
silent
city
lay
like
a
great
ship
becalmed
on
a
tropical
ocean
the
same
dead
silence
the
same
cruel
smiling
sky
above
the
same
hopeless
submission
to
fate
in
every
soul
on
board
that
how
would
those
poor
dying
creatures
panting
out
their
latest
breath
in
sultry
airless
chambers
have
welcomed
the
rush
of
rain
the
cool
freshness
of
a
strong
wind
blowing
along
those
streets
sweeping
away
the
polluted
dust
dispersing
noxious
odours
bringing
the
pure
scents
of
woodlands
of
hillside
heather
and
autumn
gorse
the
sweetness
of
the
country
across
the
corruption
of
the
town
but
at
this
dreadful
season
when
storm
and
rain
would
have
been
welcomed
with
passionate
thanksgiving
the
skies
were
brass
and
the
ground
was
arid
and
fiery
as
the
sands
of
the
arabian
desert
while
even
the
grass
that
grew
in
the
streets
where
last
year
multitudinous
feet
had
trodden
sickened
as
it
grew
and
faded
speedily
from
green
to
yellow
pausing
on
the
garden
terrace
to
survey
the
prospect
before
she
descended
to
the
street
angela
thought
of
that
river
as
her
imagination
had
depicted
it
after
reading
a
letter
of
hyacinth
written
so
late
as
last
may
the
gay
processions
the
gaudy
liveries
of
watermen
and
servants
the
gilded
barges
the
sound
of
viol
and
guitar
the
harmony
of
voices
in
part
songs
go
lovely
rose
or
why
so
pale
and
wan
fond
lover
the
beauty
and
the
splendour
fair
faces
under
vast
plumed
hats
those
picturesque
hats
which
the
maids
of
honour
snatched
from
each
other
heads
with
giddy
laughter
exchanging
here
on
the
royal
barge
as
they
did
sometimes
walking
about
the
great
rooms
at
whitehall
the
king
with
his
boon
companions
clustered
round
him
on
the
richly
carpeted
da√Øs
in
the
stern
his
courtiers
and
his
favoured
mistresses
haughty
castlemaine
empres
regnant
over
the
royal
heart
false
dissolute
impudent
glorious
as
cleopatra
when
her
purple
sails
bore
her
down
the
cydnus
the
wit
and
folly
and
gladness
all
had
vanished
like
the
visions
of
a
dreamer
and
there
remained
but
this
mourning
city
with
its
closed
windows
and
doors
its
watchmen
guarding
the
marked
houses
lest
disease
and
death
should
hold
communion
with
that
poor
remnant
of
health
and
life
left
in
the
infected
town
would
that
fantastic
vision
of
careless
monarch
and
butterfly
court
ever
be
realised
again
angela
thought
not
it
seemed
to
her
serious
mind
that
the
glory
of
those
wild
years
since
his
restoration
was
a
delusive
and
pernicious
brightness
which
could
never
shine
again
that
extravagant
splendour
that
reckless
gaiety
had
borne
beneath
their
glittering
surface
the
seeds
of
ruin
and
death
an
angry
god
had
stretched
out
his
hand
against
the
wicked
city
where
sin
and
profaneness
sat
in
the
high
places
if
charles
stuart
and
his
courtiers
ever
came
back
to
london
they
would
return
sobered
and
chastened
taught
wisdom
by
adversity
the
puritan
spirit
would
reign
once
more
in
the
land
and
an
age
of
penitence
and
lenten
would
succeed
the
orgies
of
the
restoration
while
the
light
loves
of
whitehall
the
noble
ladies
the
impudent
actresses
would
vanish
into
obscurity
angela
loyal
young
heart
was
full
of
faith
in
the
king
she
was
ready
to
believe
that
his
sins
were
the
sins
of
a
man
whose
head
had
been
turned
by
the
sudden
change
from
exile
to
a
throne
from
poverty
to
wealth
from
dependence
upon
his
bourbon
cousin
and
his
friends
in
holland
to
the
lavish
subsidies
of
a
commons
no
words
could
paint
the
desolation
which
reigned
between
the
strand
and
the
city
in
that
fatal
summer
now
drawing
to
its
melancholy
close
more
than
once
in
her
brief
pilgrimage
angela
drew
back
shuddering
from
the
embrasure
of
a
door
or
the
inlet
to
some
narrow
alley
at
sight
of
death
lying
on
the
threshold
stiff
stark
unheeded
more
than
once
in
her
progress
from
the
new
exchange
to
st
paul
she
heard
the
shrill
wail
of
women
lamenting
for
a
soul
just
departed
death
was
about
and
around
her
the
great
bell
of
the
cathedral
tolled
with
an
inexorable
stroke
in
the
summer
stillness
as
it
had
tolled
every
day
through
those
long
months
of
heat
and
drought
and
fear
and
graves
eastward
there
rose
the
red
glare
of
a
great
fire
and
she
feared
that
some
of
those
old
wooden
houses
in
the
narrower
streets
were
blazing
but
on
inquiry
of
a
solitary
foot
passenger
she
learnt
that
this
fire
was
one
of
many
which
had
been
burning
for
three
days
at
street
corners
and
in
open
spaces
at
a
great
expense
of
with
the
hope
of
purifying
the
atmosphere
and
dispersing
poisonous
gases
but
that
so
far
no
amelioration
had
followed
upon
this
outlay
and
labour
she
came
presently
to
a
junction
of
roads
near
the
fleet
ditch
and
saw
the
huge
flaming
with
a
sickly
glare
in
the
sunshine
tended
by
a
spectral
figure
and
to
whom
she
gave
an
alms
and
at
this
juncture
of
ways
a
great
peril
awaited
her
for
there
sprang
as
it
were
out
of
the
very
ground
so
quickly
did
they
assemble
from
neighbouring
courts
and
alleys
a
throng
of
mendicants
who
clustered
round
her
with
filthy
hands
outstretched
and
shrill
voices
imploring
charity
so
wasted
were
their
limbs
so
ghastly
and
livid
their
countenances
that
they
might
have
all
been
and
angela
recoiled
from
them
in
horror
keep
your
distance
for
pity
sake
good
friends
and
i
will
give
you
all
the
money
i
carry
she
exclaimed
and
there
was
something
of
command
in
her
voice
and
aspect
as
she
stood
before
them
straight
and
tall
with
pale
earnest
face
they
fell
off
a
little
way
and
waited
till
she
scattered
the
contents
of
her
purse
small
flemish
coin
upon
the
ground
in
front
of
her
where
they
scrambled
for
it
snarling
and
scuffling
with
each
other
like
dogs
fighting
for
a
bone
hastening
her
footsteps
after
the
horror
of
that
encounter
she
went
by
ludgate
hill
to
the
great
cathedral
keeping
carefully
to
the
middle
of
the
street
and
glancing
at
the
walls
and
shuttered
casements
on
either
side
of
her
recalling
that
appalling
story
which
the
italian
at
the
ursulines
had
told
her
of
the
great
plague
in
milan
how
one
morning
the
walls
and
doors
of
many
houses
in
the
city
had
been
found
smeared
with
some
foul
substance
in
broad
streaks
of
white
and
yellow
which
was
believed
to
be
a
poisonous
compost
carrying
contagion
to
every
creature
who
touched
or
went
within
the
influence
of
its
mephitic
odour
how
this
thing
had
happened
not
once
but
many
times
until
the
milanese
believed
that
satan
himself
was
the
prime
mover
in
this
horror
and
that
there
were
a
company
of
wretches
who
had
sold
themselves
to
the
devil
and
were
his
servants
and
agents
spreading
disease
and
death
through
the
city
strange
tales
were
told
of
those
who
had
seen
the
foul
fiend
face
to
face
and
had
refused
his
proffered
gold
innocent
men
were
denounced
and
but
narrowly
escaped
being
torn
limb
from
limb
or
trampled
to
death
under
the
suspicion
of
being
concerned
in
this
anointing
of
the
walls
and
even
the
cathedral
benches
with
yet
no
death
that
the
nun
could
remember
had
ever
been
traced
directly
to
the
compost
it
was
a
mysterious
terror
which
struck
deep
into
the
hearts
of
a
frightened
people
so
that
at
last
against
his
better
reason
and
at
the
repeated
prayer
of
his
flock
the
good
archbishop
allowed
the
crystal
coffin
of
carlo
borromeo
to
be
carried
in
solemn
procession
upon
the
shoulders
of
cardinals
from
end
to
end
of
the
city
on
which
occasion
all
milan
crowded
into
the
streets
and
clustered
thick
on
either
side
of
the
pompous
train
of
monks
and
priests
and
acolytes
but
soon
there
fell
a
deeper
despair
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
doomed
city
for
within
two
days
after
this
solemn
carrying
of
the
saintly
remains
the
had
tripled
and
there
was
scarce
a
house
in
which
the
contagion
had
not
entered
then
it
was
said
that
the
anointers
had
been
in
active
work
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
and
had
been
busiest
in
the
public
squares
where
the
bearers
of
the
crystal
coffin
halted
for
a
space
with
their
sacred
load
and
where
the
people
clustered
thickest
the
archbishop
had
foreseen
the
danger
of
this
gathering
of
the
people
many
but
just
recovering
from
the
disease
many
infected
and
unconscious
of
their
state
but
his
flock
saw
only
the
handiwork
of
the
fiend
in
this
increase
of
evil
in
protestant
london
there
had
been
less
inclination
to
superstition
yet
even
here
a
comet
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
appeared
but
as
other
comets
was
thought
to
wear
the
shape
of
a
fiery
sword
stretched
over
the
city
in
awful
threatening
full
of
pity
and
of
gravest
saddest
thoughts
the
lonely
girl
walked
through
the
lonely
town
to
that
part
of
the
city
where
the
streets
were
narrowest
a
labyrinth
of
lanes
and
alleys
with
a
or
steeple
rising
up
amidst
the
crowded
dwellings
at
almost
every
point
to
which
the
eye
looked
angela
wondered
at
the
sight
of
so
many
fine
churches
in
this
heretical
land
many
of
these
city
churches
were
left
open
in
this
day
of
wrath
so
that
unhappy
souls
who
had
a
mind
to
pray
might
go
in
at
will
and
kneel
there
angela
peered
in
at
an
old
church
in
a
narrow
court
holding
the
door
a
little
way
ajar
and
looking
along
the
cold
grey
nave
all
was
gloom
and
silence
save
for
a
monotonous
and
suppressed
murmur
of
one
invisible
worshipper
in
a
pew
near
the
altar
who
varied
his
supplicatory
mutterings
with
sighs
angela
turned
with
a
shudder
from
the
cold
emptiness
of
the
great
grey
church
with
its
sombre
woodwork
and
lack
of
all
those
beautiful
forms
which
appeal
to
the
heart
and
imagination
in
a
romanist
temple
she
thought
how
in
flanders
there
would
have
been
tapers
burning
and
censors
swinging
and
the
rolling
thunder
of
the
organ
pealing
along
the
vaulted
roof
in
the
solemn
strains
of
a
lifting
the
soul
of
the
worshipper
into
the
heaven
of
the
world
beyond
death
soothing
the
sorrowful
heart
with
visions
of
eternal
bliss
she
wandered
through
the
maze
of
streets
and
lanes
sometimes
coming
back
unawares
to
a
street
she
had
lately
traversed
till
at
last
she
came
to
a
church
that
was
not
silent
for
through
the
open
door
she
heard
a
voice
within
preaching
or
praying
she
hesitated
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
threshold
having
been
taught
that
it
was
a
sin
to
enter
a
protestant
church
and
then
something
within
her
some
new
sense
of
independence
and
revolt
against
old
traditions
moved
her
to
enter
and
take
her
place
quietly
in
one
of
the
curious
wooden
boxes
where
the
sparse
congregation
were
seated
listening
to
a
man
in
a
geneva
gown
who
was
preaching
in
a
tall
oaken
pulpit
surmounted
by
a
massive
and
furnished
with
a
crimson
velvet
cushion
which
the
preacher
used
with
great
effect
during
his
discourse
now
folding
his
arms
upon
it
and
leaning
forward
to
argue
familiarly
with
his
flock
now
stretching
a
long
lean
arm
above
it
to
point
a
denouncing
finger
at
the
sinners
below
anon
belabouring
it
severely
in
the
passion
of
his
eloquence
the
flock
was
small
but
devout
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
and
elderly
persons
in
sombre
attire
and
of
puritanical
aspect
for
the
preacher
was
one
of
those
calvinistic
clergy
of
cromwell
time
who
had
been
lately
evicted
from
their
pulpits
and
prosecuted
for
assembling
congregations
under
the
roofs
of
private
citizens
and
had
shown
a
noble
perseverance
in
serving
god
in
circumstances
of
peculiar
difficulty
and
now
though
the
primate
had
remained
at
his
post
unfaltering
and
unafraid
many
of
the
orthodox
shepherds
had
fled
and
left
their
sheep
being
too
careful
of
their
own
tender
persons
to
remain
in
the
town
and
minister
to
the
sick
and
dying
whereupon
the
evicted
clergy
had
in
some
cases
taken
possession
of
the
deserted
pulpits
and
the
silent
churches
and
were
preaching
christ
gospel
to
that
remnant
of
the
faithful
which
feared
not
to
assemble
in
the
house
of
god
angela
listened
to
a
sermon
marked
by
a
rough
eloquence
which
enchained
her
attention
and
moved
her
heart
it
was
not
difficult
to
utter
words
or
move
the
tender
breast
to
pity
when
the
preacher
theme
was
death
with
all
its
train
of
attendant
agonies
its
partings
and
farewells
its
awful
suddenness
as
shown
in
this
pestilence
where
a
young
man
rejoicing
in
his
health
and
strength
at
noontide
sees
as
the
sun
slopes
westward
the
on
his
bosom
and
is
lying
dumb
and
stark
at
where
the
joyous
maiden
is
surprised
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
by
the
apparition
of
the
and
in
a
few
hours
is
lifeless
clay
the
preacher
dwelt
upon
the
sins
and
follies
and
vanities
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
great
city
their
alacrity
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
their
slackness
in
the
service
of
god
a
man
who
will
give
twenty
shillings
for
a
pair
of
laced
gloves
to
a
pretty
shopwoman
at
the
new
exchange
will
grudge
a
crown
for
the
maintenance
of
god
people
that
are
in
distress
and
one
who
is
not
hardy
enough
to
walk
half
a
mile
to
church
will
stand
for
a
whole
afternoon
in
the
pit
of
a
theatre
to
see
painted
defile
a
stage
that
was
evil
enough
in
the
late
king
time
but
which
has
in
these
latter
days
sunk
to
a
depth
of
infamy
that
it
befits
not
me
to
speak
of
in
this
holy
place
oh
my
brethren
out
of
that
glittering
dream
which
you
have
dreamt
since
his
majesty
return
out
of
the
groves
of
baal
where
you
have
sung
and
danced
and
feasted
worshipping
false
gods
steeping
your
benighted
souls
in
the
vices
of
pagans
and
it
has
pleased
the
god
of
israel
to
give
you
a
rough
waking
can
you
doubt
that
this
plague
which
has
desolated
a
city
and
filled
many
a
yawning
pit
with
the
promiscuous
dead
has
been
god
way
of
chastening
a
profligate
people
a
people
caring
only
for
fleshly
pleasures
for
rich
meats
and
strong
wines
for
fine
clothing
and
jovial
company
and
despising
the
spiritual
blessings
that
the
almighty
father
has
reserved
for
them
that
love
him
oh
my
afflicted
brethren
bethink
you
that
this
pestilence
is
a
chastisement
upon
a
blind
and
foolish
people
and
if
it
strikes
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
if
it
falls
as
heavily
upon
the
spotless
virgin
as
upon
the
hoary
sinner
remember
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
measure
the
workings
of
omnipotence
with
the
of
our
earthly
intellects
or
to
say
this
fair
girl
should
be
spared
and
that
hoary
sinner
taken
has
not
the
angel
of
death
ever
chosen
the
fairest
blossoms
his
business
is
to
people
the
skies
rather
than
to
depopulate
the
earth
the
innocent
are
taken
but
the
warning
is
for
the
guilty
for
the
sinners
whose
debaucheries
have
made
this
world
so
polluted
a
place
that
god
greatest
mercy
to
the
pure
is
an
early
death
the
call
is
loud
and
instant
a
call
to
repentance
and
sacrifice
let
each
bear
his
portion
of
suffering
with
patience
as
under
that
wise
rule
of
a
score
years
past
each
family
forewent
a
weekly
meal
to
help
those
who
needed
bread
let
each
acknowledge
his
debt
to
god
and
be
content
to
have
paid
it
in
a
season
of
universal
sorrow
and
then
the
preacher
turned
from
that
awful
image
of
an
angry
and
avenging
god
to
contemplate
divine
compassion
in
the
redeemer
of
mankind
godlike
power
joined
with
human
love
he
preached
of
christ
the
saviour
with
a
fulness
and
a
force
which
were
new
to
angela
he
held
up
that
commanding
that
touching
image
unobscured
by
any
other
personality
all
those
surrounding
figures
which
angela
had
seen
crowded
around
the
godlike
form
all
those
sufferings
and
virtues
of
the
spotless
mother
of
god
were
ignored
in
that
impassioned
oration
the
preacher
held
up
christ
crucified
him
only
as
the
fountain
of
pity
and
pardon
he
reduced
christianity
to
its
simplest
elements
primitive
as
when
the
memory
of
the
was
yet
fresh
in
the
minds
of
those
who
had
seen
the
divine
countenance
and
listened
to
the
divine
voice
and
angela
felt
as
she
had
never
felt
before
the
singleness
and
purity
of
the
christian
faith
it
was
the
day
of
long
sermons
when
a
preacher
who
measured
his
discourse
by
the
sands
of
an
was
deemed
moderate
among
the
nonconformists
there
were
those
who
turned
the
glass
and
let
the
flood
of
eloquence
flow
on
far
into
the
second
hour
the
old
man
had
been
preaching
a
long
time
when
angela
awoke
as
from
a
dream
and
remembered
that
where
duty
called
her
she
left
the
church
quietly
and
hurried
westward
guided
chiefly
by
the
sun
till
she
found
herself
once
more
in
the
strand
and
very
soon
afterwards
she
was
ringing
the
bell
at
the
chief
entrance
of
fareham
house
she
returned
far
more
depressed
in
spirits
than
she
went
out
for
all
the
horror
of
the
city
was
upon
her
and
fresh
from
the
spectacle
of
death
she
felt
less
hopeful
of
lord
recovery
thomas
stokes
opened
the
great
door
to
admit
that
one
modest
figure
a
door
which
looked
as
if
it
should
open
only
to
noble
visitors
to
a
procession
of
courtiers
and
court
beauties
in
the
fitful
light
of
torches
thomas
when
interrogated
was
not
cheerful
in
his
account
of
the
health
during
angela
absence
my
lord
had
been
strangely
disordered
basset
had
found
the
fever
increasing
and
was
afeared
the
gentleman
was
relapsing
angela
heart
sickened
at
the
thought
the
preacher
had
dwelt
on
the
sudden
alternations
of
the
disease
how
apparent
recovery
was
sometimes
the
precursor
of
death
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
and
through
the
seemingly
endless
suite
of
rooms
which
nobody
wanted
which
never
might
be
inhabited
again
perhaps
except
by
bats
and
owls
to
his
lordship
chamber
and
found
him
sitting
up
in
bed
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
by
which
she
entered
at
last
he
cried
why
did
you
inflict
such
torturing
apprehensions
upon
me
this
woman
has
been
telling
me
of
the
horrors
of
the
streets
where
you
have
been
and
i
figured
you
stricken
suddenly
with
this
foul
malady
creeping
into
some
deserted
alley
to
expire
uncared
for
dying
with
your
head
upon
a
stone
lying
there
to
be
carried
off
by
the
you
must
not
leave
this
house
again
save
for
the
coach
that
shall
fetch
you
to
oxfordshire
to
join
hyacinth
and
her
children
and
that
coach
shall
start
i
am
a
madman
to
have
let
you
stay
so
long
in
this
infected
house
you
forget
that
i
am
she
answered
throwing
off
hood
and
cloak
and
going
to
his
bedside
to
the
chair
in
which
she
had
spent
many
hours
watching
by
him
and
praying
for
him
no
there
was
no
relapse
he
had
only
been
restless
and
uneasy
because
of
her
absence
the
disease
was
conquered
the
were
healing
fairly
and
his
nurses
had
only
to
contend
against
the
weakness
and
depression
which
seemed
but
the
natural
sequence
of
the
malady
hodgkin
was
satisfied
with
his
patient
progress
he
had
written
to
lady
fareham
advising
her
to
send
some
of
her
servants
with
horses
for
his
lordship
coach
and
to
provide
for
relays
of
between
london
and
oxfordshire
a
matter
of
easier
accomplishment
than
it
would
have
been
in
the
earlier
summer
when
the
quality
were
flying
to
the
country
and
were
at
a
premium
now
there
were
but
few
people
of
rank
or
standing
who
had
the
courage
to
stay
in
town
like
the
archbishop
who
had
not
left
lambeth
or
the
stout
old
duke
of
albemarle
at
the
cockpit
who
feared
the
pestilence
no
more
than
he
feared
sword
or
cannon
two
of
his
lordship
lackeys
and
his
oxfordshire
and
clerk
of
the
kitchen
arrived
a
week
after
angela
landing
bringing
loving
letters
from
hyacinth
to
her
husband
and
sister
the
physician
had
so
written
as
not
to
scare
the
wife
she
had
been
told
that
her
husband
had
been
ill
but
was
in
a
fair
way
to
recovery
and
would
post
to
oxfordshire
as
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
for
the
journey
carrying
his
with
him
and
lying
at
the
accustomed
inn
at
high
wycombe
or
perchance
resting
two
nights
and
spending
three
days
upon
the
road
that
was
a
happy
day
for
angela
when
her
patient
was
well
enough
to
start
on
his
journey
she
had
been
longing
to
see
her
sister
and
the
children
longing
still
more
intensely
to
escape
from
the
horror
of
that
house
where
death
had
seemed
to
lie
in
ambush
behind
the
tapestry
hangings
and
where
few
of
her
hours
had
been
free
from
a
great
fear
even
while
fareham
was
on
the
to
recovery
there
had
been
in
her
mind
the
dread
of
a
relapse
she
rejoiced
with
fear
and
trembling
and
was
almost
afraid
to
believe
physician
and
nurse
when
they
assured
her
that
all
danger
was
over
the
pestilence
had
passed
by
and
they
went
out
in
the
sunshine
in
the
freshness
of
a
september
morning
balmy
yet
cool
with
a
scent
of
flowers
from
the
gardens
of
lambeth
and
bankside
blowing
across
the
river
even
this
terrible
london
the
forsaken
city
looked
fair
in
the
morning
light
her
palaces
and
churches
her
streets
of
heavily
timbered
houses
their
projecting
windows
enriched
with
carved
wood
and
wrought
iron
streets
that
recalled
the
days
of
the
tudors
and
even
suggested
an
earlier
and
rougher
age
when
the
french
king
rode
in
all
honour
albeit
a
prisoner
at
his
conqueror
side
or
later
when
fallen
richard
shorn
of
all
royal
dignity
rode
abject
and
forlorn
through
the
city
and
caps
were
flung
up
for
his
usurping
cousin
but
oh
the
horror
of
closed
shops
and
deserted
houses
and
pestiferous
wretches
running
by
the
coach
door
in
their
poisonous
rags
begging
alms
whenever
the
horses
went
slowly
in
those
narrow
streets
that
lay
between
fareham
house
and
westminster
to
angela
wondering
eyes
westminster
hall
and
the
abbey
offered
a
new
idea
of
magnificence
so
grandly
placed
so
dignified
in
their
antiquity
fareham
watched
her
eager
countenance
as
the
great
family
coach
which
had
been
sent
up
from
oxfordshire
for
his
accommodation
moved
ponderously
westward
past
the
chancellor
new
palace
and
other
new
mansions
to
the
hercules
pillars
inn
past
knightsbridge
and
kensington
and
then
northward
by
rustic
lanes
and
through
the
village
of
ealing
to
the
oxford
road
the
family
coach
was
as
big
as
a
small
parlour
and
afforded
ample
room
for
the
convalescent
to
recline
at
his
ease
on
one
seat
while
angela
and
the
steward
a
confidential
servant
with
the
manners
of
a
courtier
sat
side
by
side
upon
the
other
they
had
the
two
spaniels
with
them
puck
and
ganymede
little
beasts
black
and

cosily
in

sat
and

at

from
angela

both
snarled
at
manningtree
the

and
resented
the
slightest
familiarity
on
his
part
lord
fareham
thoughtful
face
brightened
with
its
rare
smile
half
amused
half
cynical
as
he
watched
angela
eager
looks
devouring
every
object
on
the
road
those
grave
eyes
look
at
our
london
grandeurs
with
a
meek
wonder
something
as
thy
namesake
an
angel
might
look
upon
the
splendours
of
babylon
you
can
remember
nothing
of
yonder
palace
or
senate
house
or
abbey
i
think
child
yes
i
remember
the
abbey
though
it
looked
different
then
i
saw
it
through
a
cloud
of
falling
snow
it
was
all
faint
and
dim
there
there
were
soldiers
in
the
streets
and
it
was
bitter
cold
and
my
father
sat
in
the
coach
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
when
i
spoke
to
him
and
tried
to
pull
his
hands
away
for
i
was
afraid
of
that
hidden
face
he
shook
me
off
and
groaned
aloud
oh
such
a
harrowing
groan
i
should
have
thought
him
mad
had
i
known
what
madness
meant
but
i
know
not
what
i
thought
i
remember
only
that
i
was
frightened
and
later
when
i
asked
him
why
he
was
sorry
he
said
it
was
for
the
king
ay
poor
king
we
have
all
supped
full
of
sorrow
for
his
sake
we
have
cursed
and
hated
his
enemies
and
drawn
and
quartered
their
vile
carcases
and
have
dug
them
out
of
the
darkness
where
the
worms
were
eating
them
we
have
been
distraught
with
indignation
cruel
in
our
fury
and
i
look
back
after
fifteen
years
and
see
but
too
clearly
now
that
charles
stuart
death
lies
at
one
man
door
at
cromwell
at
bradshaw
no
child
at
his
own
cromwell
would
have
never
been
heard
of
save
in
huntingdon
as
a
yeoman
had
charles
been
strong
and
true
the
king
weakness
was
cromwell
opportunity
he
dug
his
own
grave
with
false
promises
with
with
an
inimitable
talent
for
always
doing
the
wrong
thing
and
choosing
the
wrong
road
open
not
so
wide
those
reproachful
eyes
oh
i
grant
you
he
was
a
noble
king
a
king
of
kings
to
walk
in
a
royal
procession
to
sit
upon
a
da√Øs
under
a
velvet
and
gold
canopy
to
receive
ambassadors
and
patronise
foreign
painters
and
fulfil
all
that
is
splendid
and
stately
in
ideal
kingship
he
was
an
adoring
husband
confiding
to
simplicity
a
kind
father
a
fond
friend
though
never
a
firm
one
oh
surely
surely
you
loved
him
not
as
your
father
loved
him
for
i
never
suffered
with
him
it
was
those
who
sacrificed
the
most
who
loved
him
best
those
who
were
with
him
to
the
end
long
after
common
sense
told
them
his
cause
was
hopeless
indeed
i
believe
my
father
knew
as
much
at
nottingham
when
that
luckless
standard
was
blown
down
in
the
tempest
those
who
starved
for
him
and
lay
out
on
barren
moors
through
the
cold
english
nights
for
him
and
wore
their
clothes
threadbare
and
their
shoes
into
holes
for
him
and
left
wife
and
children
and
melted
their
silver
and
squandered
their
gold
for
him
those
are
the
men
who
love
his
memory
dearest
and
for
whose
poor
sakes
we
of
the
younger
generation
must
make
believe
to
think
him
a
saint
and
a
martyr
oh
my
lord
say
not
that
you
think
him
a
bad
man
bad
nay
i
believe
that
all
his
instincts
were
virtuous
and
honourable
and
that
until
the
whirlwind
of
those
latter
days
in
which
he
scarce
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
meant
fairly
by
his
people
and
had
their
welfare
at
heart
he
might
have
done
far
better
for
himself
and
others
had
he
been
a
brave
bad
man
like
wentworth
audacious
unscrupulous
driving
straight
to
a
fixed
goal
no
angela
he
was
that
which
is
worse
for
mankind
an
obstinate
weak
man
a
bundle
of
impulses
some
good
and
some
evil
a
man
who
had
many
chances
and
lost
them
all
who
loved
foolishly
and
too
well
and
let
himself
be
ruled
by
a
wife
who
could
not
rule
herself
blind
impulse
passionate
folly
were
sailing
the
state
ship
through
that
sea
of
troubles
which
could
be
crossed
but
by
a
navigator
as
politic
profound
and
crafty
as
richelieu
or
mazarin
who
can
wonder
that
the
royal
charles
went
down
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
looking
back
from
the
court
as
letters
have
painted
it
to
that
time
of
trouble
strange
i
stand
in
the
crowd
at
whitehall
sometimes
amidst
their
masking
and
folly
their
frolic
schemes
their
malice
their
jeering
wit
and
riotous
merriment
and
wonder
whether
it
is
all
a
dream
and
i
shall
wake
and
see
the
england
of
the
year
henrietta
maria
vanished
a
discrowned
fugitive
from
the
scene
where
she
had
lived
to
do
harm
i
look
along
the
perspective
of
painted
faces
and
flowing
hair
jewels
and
gay
colours
towards
that
window
through
which
charles
walked
to
his
bloody
death
suffered
with
a
kingly
grandeur
that
made
the
world
forget
all
that
was
poor
and
petty
in
his
life
and
i
wonder
does
anyone
else
recall
that
suffering
or
reflect
upon
that
doom
not
one
each
has
his
jest
and
his
mistress
the
eyes
he
worships
the
lips
he
adores
it
is
only
the
rural
put
that
feels
himself
lost
in
the
crowd
whose
thoughts
turn
sadly
to
the
sad
past
yet
whatever
your
lordship
may
say
tush
child
i
am
no
lordship
to
you
call
me
brother
or
fareham
and
never
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
anything
else
than
your
brother
in
affection
it
is
sweet
to
hear
you
say
so
much
sir
she
answered
gently
i
have
often
envied
my
companions
at
the
ursulines
when
they
talked
of
their
brothers
it
was
so
strange
to
hear
them
tell
of
bickering
and
between
brother
and
sister
had
god
given
me
a
brother
i
would
not
quarrel
with
him
nor
shall
thou
quarrel
with
me
sweetheart
but
we
will
be
fast
friends
always
do
i
not
owe
thee
my
life
i
will
not
hear
you
say
so
it
is
blasphemy
against
your
creator
who
relented
and
spared
you
what
you
think
that
omnipotence
in
the
inaccessible
mystery
of
heaven
keeps
the
of
earth
open
before
him
and
reckons
each
little
life
as
it
drops
off
the
list
that
is
hardly
my
notion
of
divinity
i
see
the
almighty
rather
as
the
roman
poet
saw
him
an
inexorable
father
hurling
the
thunderbolt
our
folly
has
deserved
from
his
red
right
hand
yet
merciful
to
stay
that
hand
when
we
have
taken
our
punishment
meekly
that
angela
is
the
nearest
my
mind
can
reach
to
the
idea
of
a
personal
god
but
do
not
bend
those
pencilled
brows
with
such
a
sad
perplexity
you
know
doubtless
that
i
come
of
a
catholic
family
and
was
bred
in
the
old
faith
alas
i
have
conformed
ill
to
church
discipline
i
am
no
theologian
nor
quite
an
infidel
and
should
be
as
much
at
sea
in
an
argument
with
hobbes
as
with
bossuet
trouble
not
thy
gentle
spirit
for
my
sins
of
thought
or
deed
your
tender
care
has
given
me
time
to
repent
all
my
errors
you
were
going
to
tell
my
lordship
something
when
i
chid
you
for
excess
of
ceremony
nay
sir
brother
i
had
but
to
say
that
this
wicked
court
of
which
my
father
and
you
have
spoken
so
ill
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
turned
from
its
sins
by
so
terrible
a
visitation
those
who
have
looked
upon
the
city
as
i
saw
it
a
week
ago
can
scarce
return
with
unchastened
hearts
to
feasting
and
dancing
and
idle
company
but
the
beaux
and
belles
of
whitehall
have
not
seen
the
city
as
my
brave
girl
saw
it
cried
fareham
they
have
not
met
the
nor
heard
the
groans
of
the
dying
nor
seen
the
red
cross
upon
the
doors
they
made
off
with
the
first
rumour
of
peril
the
roads
were
crowded
with
their
coaches
their
their
furniture
and
finery
one
could
scarce
command
a
for
love
or
money
thousand
less
this
week
says
one
may
be
going
back
to
town
and
have
the
theatres
open
again
in
the
cold
weather
they
dined
at
the
crown
at
uxbridge
which
was
that
fair
house
at
the
end
of
the
town
provided
for
the
meeting
of
the
late
king
commissioners
with
the
representatives
of
the
parliament
in
the
year
fareham
showed
his
a
spacious
panelled
parlour
which
was
that
fair
room
in
the
middle
of
the
house
that
had
been
handsomely
dressed
up
for
the
commissioners
to
sit
in
they
pushed
on
to
high
wycombe
before
and
supped
in
the
best
room
of
the
inn
with
fareham
faithful
manningtree
to
bring
in
the
chief
dish
and
the
people
of
the
house
to
wait
upon
them
they
were
very
friendly
and
happy
together
fareham
telling
his
companion
much
of
his
adventurous
life
in
france
and
how
in
the
first
fronde
war
he
had
been
on
the
side
of
queen
and
minister
and
afterwards
for
love
and
admiration
of
cond√©
had
joined
the
party
of
the
princes
well
it
was
a
time
worth
living
in
a
good
education
for
the
louis
for
it
showed
him
that
the
hereditary
ruler
of
a
great
nation
has
something
more
to
do
than
to
be
born
and
to
exist
and
to
spend
money
lord
fareham
described
the
shining
lights
of
that
brilliant
court
with
a
caustic
tongue
but
he
was
more
indulgent
to
the
follies
of
the
palais
royal
and
the
louvre
than
he
had
been
to
the
debaucheries
of
whitehall
there
is
a
grace
even
in
their
vices
he
said
their
wit
is
lighter
and
there
is
more
mind
in
their
follies
our
mirth
is
vulgar
even
when
it
is
not
bestial
i
know
of
no
parisian
adventure
so
degrading
as
certain
pranks
of
buckhurst
which
i
would
not
dare
mention
in
your
hearing
we
imitate
them
and
herod
but
we
are
never
like
them
we
send
to
paris
for
our
clothes
and
borrow
their
newest
words
for
they
are
ever
inventing
some
cant
phrase
to
startle
dulness
and
we
make
our
language
a
foreign
farrago
why
here
is
even
plain
john
evelyn
that
most
pious
of
pedants
pleading
for
the
enlistment
of
a
troop
of
gallic
substantives
and
adjectives
to
eke
out
our
native
english
fareham
told
angela
much
of
his
past
life
during
the
freedom
of
that
long
talking
to
her
as
if
she
had
indeed
been
a
young
sister
from
whom
he
had
been
separated
since
her
childhood
that
mild
pensive
manner
promised
sympathy
and
understanding
and
he
unconsciously
inclined
to
confide
his
thoughts
and
opinions
to
her
as
well
as
the
history
of
his
youth
he
had
fought
at
edgehill
as
a
lad
of
thirteen
had
been
with
the
king
at
beverley
york
and
nottingham
and
had
only
left
the
court
to
accompany
the
prince
of
wales
to
jersey
and
afterwards
to
paris
i
soon
sickened
of
a
court
life
and
its
petty
plots
and
parlour
intrigues
he
told
angela
and
was
glad
to
join
cond√©
army
where
my
father
influence
got
me
a
captaincy
before
i
was
eighteen
to
fight
under
such
a
leader
as
that
was
to
serve
under
the
god
of
war
i
can
imagine
mars
himself
no
grander
soldier
oh
my
dear
what
a
man
nay
i
will
not
call
him
by
that
common
name
he
was
something
more
or
less
than
man
of
another
species
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
a
lion
in
his
dominion
over
armies
in
his
calmness
amidst
danger
a
god
shall
i
ever
see
it
again
i
wonder
that
vulture
face
those
eyes
that
flashed
jove
red
lightning
your
own
face
changes
when
you
speak
of
him
said
angela
at
that
fierce
energy
which
heroic
memories
evoked
in
fareham
wasted
countenance
nay
you
should
have
seen
the
change
in
face
when
he
flung
off
the
courtier
for
the
captain
his
whole
being
was
transformed
those
who
knew
cond√©
at
germain
at
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
at
the
palais
royal
knew
not
the
measure
or
the
might
of
that
great
nature
he
was
born
to
conquer
but
you
must
not
think
that
with
him
victory
meant
brute
force
it
meant
thought
and
patience
the
power
to
foresee
and
to
combine
the
rapid
apprehension
of
opposing
circumstances
the
just
measure
of
his
own
materials
a
strict
disciplinarian
a
severe
master
but
willing
to
work
at
the
lowest
details
the
humblest
offices
of
war
a
soldier
did
i
say
he
was
the
genius
of
modern
warfare
you
talk
as
if
you
loved
him
dearly
i
loved
him
as
i
shall
never
love
any
other
man
he
was
my
friend
as
well
as
my
general
but
i
claim
no
merit
in
loving
one
whom
all
the
world
honoured
could
you
have
seen
princes
and
nobles
as
i
saw
them
when
i
was
a
boy
at
paris
standing
on
chairs
on
tables
kneeling
to
drink
his
health
a
could
have
received
no
more
fervent
adulation
alas
sister
i
look
back
at
those
years
of
foreign
service
and
know
they
were
the
best
of
my
life
they
started
early
next
morning
and
were
within
half
a
dozen
miles
of
oxford
before
the
sun
was
low
they
drove
by
a
level
road
that
skirted
the
river
and
now
for
the
first
time
angela
saw
that
river
flowing
placidly
through
a
rural
landscape
the
rich
green
of
marshy
meadows
in
the
foreground
and
low
wooded
hills
on
the
opposite
bank
while
midway
across
the
stream
an
islet
covered
with
reed
and
willow
cast
a
shadow
over
the
rosy
water
painted
by
the
western
sun
are
we
near
them
now
she
asked
eagerly
knowing
that
her
mansion
lay
within
a
few
miles
of
oxford
we
are
very
near
answered
fareham
i
can
see
the
chimneys
and
the
white
stone
pillars
of
the
great
gate
he
had
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
looking
sunward
shading
his
eyes
with
his
big
gauntlet
as
he
looked
those
two
days
on
the
road
the
fresh
autumn
air
the
generous
diet
the
variety
and
movement
of
the
journey
had
made
a
new
man
of
him
lean
and
gaunt
he
must
needs
be
for
some
time
to
come
but
the
dark
face
was
no
longer
bloodless
the
eyes
had
the
fire
of
health
i
see
the
gate
and
there
is
more
than
that
in
view
he
cried
excitedly
your
sister
is
coming
in
a
troop
to
meet
us
with
her
children
and
visitors
and
servants
stop
the
coach
manningtree
and
let
us
out
the
pulled
up
their
horses
and
the
steward
opened
the
coach
door
and
assisted
his
master
to
alight
fareham
footsteps
were
somewhat
uncertain
as
he
walked
slowly
along
the
waste
grass
by
the
roadside
leaning
a
little
upon
angela
shoulder
lady
fareham
came
running
towards
them
in
advance
of
children
and
friends
an
airy
figure
in
blue
and
white
her
fair
hair
flying
in
the
wind
her
arms
stretched
out
as
if
to
greet
them
from
afar
she
clasped
her
sister
to
her
breast
even
before
she
saluted
her
husband
clasped
her
and
kissed
her
laughing
between
the
kisses
welcome
my
escaped
nun
she
cried
i
never
thought
they
would
let
thee
out
of
thy
prison
or
that
thou
wouldst
muster
courage
to
break
thy
bonds
welcome
and
a
hundred
times
welcome
and
that
thou
shouldst
have
nursed
and
tended
my
ailing
lord
oh
the
wonder
of
it
while
i
within
a
hundred
miles
of
him
knew
not
that
he
was
ill
here
didst
thou
come
across
seas
to
save
him
why
is
a
modern
fairy
tale
and
she
is
the
good
fairy
said
fareham
taking
his
wife
face
between
his
two
hands
and
bending
down
to
kiss
the
white
forehead
under
its
cloud
of
pale
golden
curls
and
you
must
cherish
her
for
all
the
rest
of
your
life
but
for
her
i
should
have
died
alone
in
that
great
gaudy
house
and
the
rats
would
have
eaten
me
and
then
perhaps
you
would
have
cared
no
longer
for
the
mansion
and
would
have
had
to
build
another
further
west
by
my
lord
clarendon
where
all
the
fine
folks
are
going
and
that
would
have
been
a
pity
oh
fareham
do
not
begin
with
thy
i
know
all
your
organ
tones
from
the
tenor
of
your
kindness
to
the
bourdon
of
your
displeasure
do
you
think
i
am
not
glad
to
have
you
here
safe
and
sound
do
you
think
i
have
not
been
miserable
about
you
since
i
knew
of
your
sickness
monsieur
de
malfort
will
tell
you
whether
i
have
been
unhappy
or
not
why
malfort
what
wind
blew
you
hither
at
this
perilous
season
when
englishmen
are
going
abroad
for
fear
of
the
pestilence
and
when
your
friend
st
evremond
has
fled
from
the
beauties
of
oxford
to
the
malodorous
sewers
and
fusty
fraus
of
the
netherlands
i
had
no
fear
of
the
contagion
and
i
wanted
to
see
my
friends
i
am
in
lodgings
in
oxford
where
there
is
almost
as
much
good
company
as
there
ever
was
at
whitehall
the
comte
de
malfort
and
fareham
clasped
hands
with
a
cordiality
which
bespoke
old
friendship
and
it
was
only
an
instinctive
recoil
on
the
part
of
the
englishman
which
spared
him
his
friend
kisses
they
had
lived
in
camps
and
in
courts
together
these
two
and
had
much
in
common
and
much
that
was
antagonistic
in
temperament
and
habits
malfort
being
lazy
and
luxurious
when
no
fighting
was
on
hand
a
man
whose
one
business
when
not
under
canvas
was
to
surpass
everybody
else
in
the
fashion
and
folly
of
the
hour
to
be
quite
the
finest
gentleman
in
whatever
company
he
found
himself
he
was
a
godson
and
favourite
of
madame
de
montrond
who
had
numbered
his
father
among
the
army
of
her
devoted
admirers
he
had
been
playfellow
and
slave
in
her
early
girlhood
and
had
been
de
la
in
those
brilliant
years
of
the
young
king
reign
when
the
farehams
were
living
in
the
marais
to
him
had
been
permitted
all
privileges
that
a
being
as
harmless
and
innocent
as
he
was
polished
and
elegant
might
be
allowed
by
a
husband
who
had
too
much
confidence
in
his
wife
virtue
and
too
good
an
opinion
of
his
own
merits
to
be
easily
jealous
nor
was
henri
de
malfort
a
man
to
provoke
jealousy
by
any
superior
gifts
of
mind
or
person
nature
had
not
been
especially
kind
to
him
his
features
were
insignificant
his
eyes
pale
and
he
had
not
escaped
that
scourge
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
his
pale
and
clear
complexion
was
but
slightly
pitted
however
and
his
eyelids
had
not
suffered
men
were
inclined
to
call
him
ugly
women
thought
him
interesting
his
frame
was
badly
built
from
the
athlete
point
of
view
but
it
had
the
suppleness
which
makes
the
graceful
dancer
and
was
an
elegant
scaffolding
on
which
to
hang
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
day
for
the
rest
all
that
he
was
he
had
made
himself
during
those
eighteen
years
of
intelligent
which
had
been
his
engrossing
occupation
since
his
fifteenth
birthday
when
he
determined
to
be
one
of
the
finest
gentlemen
of
his
epoch
a
fine
gentleman
at
the
court
of
louis
had
to
be
something
more
than
a
figure
steeped
in
perfumes
and
hung
with
ribbons
his
shoes
his
periwig
and
cannon
sleeves
were
indispensable
to
fashion
but
not
enough
for
fame
the
favoured
guest
of
the
hotel
de
rambouillet
and
of
mademoiselle
de
scud√®ry
saturdays
must
have
wit
and
learning
or
at
least
that
capacity
for
smart
speech
and
pedantic
allusion
which
might
pass
current
for
both
in
a
society
where
the
critics
were
chiefly
feminine
henri
de
malfort
had
graduated
in
a
college
of
he
had
grown
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
gunpowder
and
he
had
stormed
the
breach
at
sieges
where
the
assault
was
led
off
by
a
company
of
violins
in
the
spanish
fashion
he
had
fought
with
distinction
under
the
finest
soldiers
in
europe
and
had
seen
some
of
his
dearest
friends
expire
at
his
side
unlike
gramont
and
√©vremond
he
was
still
in
the
floodtide
of
royal
favour
in
his
own
country
and
it
seemed
a
curious
caprice
that
had
led
him
to
follow
those
gentlemen
to
england
to
shine
in
a
duller
society
and
sparkle
at
a
less
magnificent
court
the
children
hung
upon
their
father
papillon
on
one
side
cupid
on
the
other
and
it
was
in
them
rather
than
in
her
sister
friend
that
angela
was
interested
the
girl
resembled
her
mother
only
in
the
grace
and
flexibility
of
her
slender
form
the
quickness
of
her
movements
and
the
vivacity
of
her
speech
her
hair
and
eyes
were
dark
like
her
father
and
her
colouring
was
that
of
a
brunette
with
something
of
a
pale
bronze
under
the
delicate
carmine
of
her
cheeks
the
boy
favoured
his
mother
and
was
worthy
of
the
sobriquet
rochester
had
bestowed
upon
him
his
blue
eyes
chubby
cheeks
cherry
lips
and
golden
hair
were
like
the
typical
cupid
of
rubens
and
might
be
seen
repeated
on
the
ceiling
of
the
banqueting
house
i
warrant
this
is
all
flummery
said
fareham
looking
down
at
the
girl
as
she
hung
upon
him
thou
art
not
glad
to
see
me
i
am
so
glad
that
i
could
eat
you
as
the
giant
would
have
eaten
jack
answered
the
girl
leaping
up
to
kiss
him
her
hair
flying
back
like
a
dark
cloud
her
nimble
legs
struggling
for
freedom
in
her
long
brocade
petticoat
and
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
contagion
afraid
why
i
wanted
mother
to
take
me
to
you
as
soon
as
i
heard
you
were
well
i
have
been
and
pickled
in
strong
waters
until
hodgkin
accounts
me
safe
or
i
would
not
come
nigh
thee
see
sweetheart
this
is
your
aunt
whom
you
are
to
love
next
best
to
your
mother
but
not
so
well
as
you
sir
you
are
first
said
the
child
and
then
turned
to
angela
and
held
up
her
rosebud
mouth
to
be
kissed
you
saved
my
father
life
she
said
if
you
ever
want
anybody
to
die
for
you
let
it
be
me
gud
what
a
delicate
wit
the
sweet
child
is
positively
exclaimed
a
young
lady
who
was
strolling
beside
them
and
whom
lady
fareham
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
introduce
by
name
to
any
one
but
who
was
now
accounted
for
as
a
country
neighbour
dorothy
lettsome
angela
was
watching
her
as
they
sauntered
along
and
she
saw
that
the
fatigue
and
agitation
of
this
meeting
were
beginning
to
affect
him
he
was
carrying
his
hat
in
one
hand
while
the
other
caressed
papillon
there
were
beads
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
and
his
footsteps
began
to
drag
a
little
happily
the
coach
had
kept
a
few
paces
in
their
rear
and
manningtree
was
walking
beside
it
so
angela
proposed
that
his
lordship
should
resume
his
seat
in
the
vehicle
and
drive
on
to
his
house
while
she
went
on
foot
with
her
sister
i
must
go
with
his
lordship
cried
papillon
and
leapt
into
the
coach
before
her
father
hyacinth
put
her
arm
through
angela
and
led
her
slowly
along
the
grassy
walk
to
the
great
gates
the
frenchman
and
lettsome
following
and
unversed
as
the
girl
was
in
the
ways
of
this
particular
world
she
could
nevertheless
perceive
that
in
the
conversation
between
these
two
de
malfort
was
amusing
himself
at
the
expense
of
his
fair
companion
his
own
english
was
by
no
means
despicable
as
he
had
spent
more
than
a
year
at
the
embassy
immediately
after
the
restoration
to
say
nothing
of
his
constant
intercourse
with
the
farehams
and
other
english
exiles
in
france
but
he
was
encouraging
the
young
lady
to
talk
to
him
in
french
which
was
spoken
with
an
affected
drawl
that
was
even
more
ridiculous
than
its
errors
in
grammar
chapter
vii
at
the
top
of
the
fashion
nothing
could
have
been
more
cordial
than
lady
fareham
welcome
to
her
sister
nor
were
it
easy
to
imagine
a
life
more
delightful
than
that
at
chilton
abbey
in
that
autumnal
season
when
every
stage
of
the
decaying
year
clothed
itself
with
a
variety
and
brilliancy
of
colouring
which
made
ruin
beautiful
and
disguised
the
approach
of
winter
as
a
court
harridan
might
hide
age
and
wrinkles
under
a
yellow
satin
mask
and
domino
the
abbey
was
one
of
those
capacious
irregular
buildings
in
which
all
that
a
house
was
in
the
past
and
all
that
it
is
in
the
present
are
composed
into
a
harmonious
whole
and
in
which
past
and
present
are
so
cunningly
interwoven
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
one
but
an
architect
to
distinguish
where
the
improvements
and
additions
of
yesterday
were
grafted
on
to
the
masonry
of
the
fourteenth
century
here
where
the
spacious
and
pantry
began
there
were
walls
massive
enough
for
the
immuring
of
refractory
nuns
and
this
corkscrew
jacobean
staircase
which
wound
with
carved
balusters
up
to
the
garret
story
had
its
foundations
in
a
flight
of
cyclopean
stone
steps
that
descended
to
the
cellars
where
the
monks
kept
their
strong
liquors
and
brewed
their
beer
half
of
my
lady
had
been
the
refectory
and
the
long
still
showed
the
groined
roof
of
an
ancient
cloister
while
the
into
which
it
opened
had
been
designed
by
inigo
jones
and
built
by
the
last
lord
fareham
all
that
there
is
of
the
romantic
in
this
kind
of
architectural
patchwork
had
been
enhanced
by
the
collection
of
old
furniture
that
the
present
possessors
of
the
abbey
had
imported
from
lady
fareham
ch√¢teau
in
normandy
and
which
was
more
interesting
though
less
splendid
than
the
furniture
of
fareham
town
mansion
as
it
was
the
result
of
gradual
accumulation
in
the
montrond
family
or
of
purchase
from
the
wreck
of
noble
houses
ruined
in
the
civil
war
which
had
distracted
france
before
the
reign
of
the
b√©arnais
to
angela
the
change
from
an
enclosed
convent
to
such
a
house
as
chilton
abbey
was
a
change
that
filled
all
her
days
with
wonder
the
splendour
the
air
of
careless
luxury
that
pervaded
her
sister
house
and
suggested
costliness
and
waste
in
every
detail
could
but
be
distressing
to
the
pupil
of
flemish
nuns
who
had
seen
even
the
trenchers
scraped
to
make
soup
for
the
poor
and
every
morsel
of
bread
garnered
as
if
it
were
gold
dust
from
that
sparse
fare
of
the
convent
to
this
rabelaisian
plenty
this
plethora
of
meat
and
poultry
huge
game
pies
and
elaborate
confectionery
this
perpetual
too
much
of
everything
was
a
transition
that
startled
and
shocked
her
she
heard
with
wonder
of
the
numerous
dinner
tables
that
were
spread
every
day
at
chilton
manningtree
table
at
which
the
roman
priest
from
oxford
dined
except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
he
was
invited
to
sit
down
with
the
quality
and
hubbock
table
where
the
superior
servants
dined
and
at
which
henriette
considered
it
a
privilege
to
himself
and
the
two
great
tables
in
the
servants
hall
twenty
at
each
table
and
the
priscilla
goodman
table
in
the
blue
parlour
upstairs
at
which
my
lady
english
and
french
and
my
lord
gentlemen
ate
and
at
which
henriette
and
her
brother
were
supposed
to
take
their
meals
but
where
they
seldom
appeared
usually
claiming
the
right
to
eat
with
their
parents
she
wondered
as
she
heard
of
the
distinctions
among
that
rabble
of
servants
the
upper
ranks
of
whom
were
supplied
by
the
small
gentry
of
servants
who
waited
upon
servants
and
again
other
servants
who
waited
on
those
down
to
that
lowest
stratum
of
kitchen
sluts
and
turnspits
who
actually
made
their
own
beds
and
scraped
their
own
trenchers
everywhere
there
was
lavish
expenditure
everywhere
the
abundance
which
among
that
uneducated
and
unthoughtful
class
ever
degenerates
into
wanton
waste
it
sickened
angela
to
see
the
long
loaded
day
after
day
with
dishes
that
were
many
of
them
left
untouched
amidst
the
superabundance
while
the
massive
cromwellian
sideboard
seemed
to
need
all
the
thickness
of
its
gouty
legs
to
sustain
the
regalia
of
hams
and
tongues
pasties
salads
and
jellies
and
all
this
time
weekly
from
london
told
of
the
unexampled
distress
in
that
afflicted
city
which
was
but
the
natural
result
of
an
epidemic
that
had
driven
all
the
away
and
left
neither
trade
nor
employment
for
the
lower
classes
what
becomes
of
that
mountain
of
food
angela
asked
her
sister
after
her
second
dinner
at
chilton
by
which
time
she
and
hyacinth
had
become
familiar
and
at
ease
with
each
other
is
it
given
to
the
poor
some
of
it
perhaps
love
but
i
warrant
that
most
of
it
is
eaten
in
the
offices
with
many
a
handsome
sirloin
and
haunch
to
boot
oh
sister
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
such
a
troop
i
am
always
meeting
strange
faces
how
many
servants
have
you
i
have
never
reckoned
them
manningtree
knows
no
doubt
for
his
wages
book
would
tell
him
i
take
it
there
may
be
more
than
fifty
and
less
than
a
hundred
anyhow
we
could
not
exist
were
they
fewer
more
than
fifty
people
to
wait
upon
four
for
our
state
and
importance
we
are
very
upon
i
nearly
died
last
week
before
i
could
get
any
one
to
bring
me
my
afternoon
chocolate
the
men
had
all
rushed
off
to
a
and
the
women
were
romping
or
fighting
in
the
laundry
except
my
own
women
who
are
too
genteel
to
play
with
the
and
had
taken
a
holiday
to
go
and
see
a
tragedy
at
oxford
i
found
myself
in
a
deserted
house
i
might
have
been
burnt
alive
or
have
expired
in
a
fit
for
aught
any
of
those
devils
cared
but
could
they
not
be
better
regulated
they
are
when
manningtree
is
at
home
he
has
them
all
under
his
thumb
and
he
is
an
honest
conscientious
man
who
knows
i
dare
say
he
robs
us
and
takes
a
de
wherever
is
offered
but
it
is
better
to
be
robbed
by
one
than
by
an
army
and
if
manningtree
keeps
others
from
cheating
he
is
worth
his
wages
and
you
dear
hyacinth
do
you
keep
no
accounts
keep
accounts
why
my
dearest
simpleton
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
woman
of
quality
keeping
accounts
unless
it
were
some
lunatic
universal
genius
like
her
grace
of
newcastle
who
rises
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
scribble
verses
and
who
might
do
anything
preposterous
keep
accounts
why
if
you
was
to
tell
me
that
two
and
two
make
five
i
could
controvert
you
from
my
own
knowledge
it
all
seems
so
strange
to
me
murmured
angela
my
aunt
supervised
all
the
expenditure
of
the
convent
and
was
unhappy
if
she
discovered
waste
in
the
smallest
item
unhappy
yes
my
dear
innocent
and
do
you
think
if
i
was
to
investigate
the
cost
of
kitchen
and
cellar
and
calculate
how
many
pounds
of
meat
each
of
our
tall
lackeys
consumes
per
diem
i
should
not
speedily
be
plagued
into
grey
hairs
and
wrinkles
i
hope
we
are
rich
enough
to
support
their
wastefulness
and
if
we
are
not
why
la
when
we
are
ruined
the
king
must
do
something
for
fareham
make
him
lord
chancellor
his
majesty
is
mighty
sick
of
poor
old
clarendon
and
his
lectures
fareham
has
a
long
head
and
would
do
as
well
as
anybody
else
for
chancellor
if
he
would
but
show
himself
at
court
oftener
and
conform
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
instead
of
holding
himself
aloof
with

has
taken
a
leaf
out
of
lord

book
and
would
not
allow
me
to
return
a
visit
lady
castlemaine
paid
me
the
other
day
in
the
utmost
friendliness
and
to
slight
her
is
the
quickest
way
to
offend
his
majesty
but
sister
you
would
not
consort
with
an
infamous
woman
infamous
who
told
you
she
is
infamous
your
innocency
should
be
ignorant
of
such
trumpery
and
one
can
be
civil
without
consorting
as
you
call
it
angela
took
her
sister
reckless
speech
for
mere
sportiveness
hyacinth
might
be
careless
and
ignorant
of
business
but
his
lordship
doubtless
knew
the
extent
of
his
income
and
was
too
grave
and
experienced
a
personage
to
be
a
spendthrift
he
had
confessed
to
seven
and
thirty
which
to
the
girl
of
twenty
seemed
serious
there
were
musicians
in
her
ladyship
household
youths
who
played
lute
and
viol
and
sang
the
dainty
meaningless
songs
of
the
latest
very
prettily
the
warm
weather
which
had
a
bad
effect
upon
the
bills
of
mortality
was
so
far
advantageous
that
it
allowed
these
gentlemen
to
sing
in
the
garden
while
the
family
were
at
supper
or
on
the
river
while
the
family
were
taking
their
evening
airing
their
newest
performance
was
an
arrangement
of
lord
dorset
lines
to
all
you
ladies
now
on
land
set
as
a
round
there
could
scarcely
be
anything
prettier
than
the
dying
fall
of
the
refrain
that
ended
every
verse
with
a
fa
la
la
perhaps
permit
some
happier
man
to
kiss
your
hand
or
flirt
your
fan
with
a
fa
la
la
the
last
lines
died
away
in
the
distance
of
the
moonlit
garden
as
the
singers
slowly
retired
while
henri
de
malfort
illustrated
that
final
couplet
with
hyacinth
fan
as
he
sat
beside
her
music
and
moonlight
and
a
garden
you
might
fancy
yourself
amidst
the
grottoes
and
terraces
of
st
germain
i
note
that
whenever
there
is
anything
meritorious
in
our
english
life
malfort
is
reminded
of
france
and
when
he
discovers
any
obnoxious
feature
in
our
manners
or
habits
he
expatiates
on
the
vast
difference
between
the
two
nations
said
his
lordship
dear
fareham
i
am
a
human
being
when
i
am
in
england
i
remember
all
i
loved
in
my
own
country
i
must
return
to
it
before
i
shall
understand
the
worth
of
all
i
leave
here
and
the
understanding
may
be
bitter
call
your
singers
back
and
let
us
have
those
two
last
verses
again
is
a
fine
tune
and
your
fellows
perform
it
with
sweetness
and
brio
the
song
was
new
the
victory
which
it
celebrated
was
fresh
in
the
minds
of
men
the
disgrace
of
later
dutch
experiences
the
ships
in
the
nore
ravaging
and
insulting
was
yet
to
come
england
still
believed
her
floating
castles
invincible
to
angela
mind
the
life
at
chilton
was
full
of
change
and
joyous
expectancy
no
hour
of
the
day
but
offered
some
variety
of
recreation
from
battledore
and
shuttlecock
in
the
to
long
days
with
the
hounds
or
the
hawks
angela
learnt
to
ride
in
less
than
a
month
instructed
by
the
a
gentleman
of
considerable
importance
in
the
household
an
old
campaigner
who
had
groomed
fareham
horses
after
many
a
battle
and
many
a
skirmish
and
had
suffered
scant
food
and
rough
quarters
without
murmuring
and
also
with
considerable
assistance
and
counsel
from
lord
fareham
and
occasional
lectures
from
papillon
who
was
a
diana
at
ten
years
old
and
rode
with
her
father
in
the
first
flight
angela
was
soon
equal
to
accompanying
her
sister
in
the
for
hyacinth
liked
following
the
chase
after
the
french
rather
than
the
english
fashion
affecting
no
ruder
sport
than
to
wait
at
an
opening
of
the
wood
or
on
the
crest
of
a
common
to
see
hounds
and
riders
sweep
by
or
favoured
by
chance
now
and
then
to
signal
the
villain
whereabouts
by
a
lace
handkerchief
waved
high
above
her
head
this
was
how
a
beautiful
lady
who
had
hunted
in
the
forests
of
germain
and
fontainebleau
understood
sport
and
such
performances
as
this
angela
found
easy
and
agreeable
they
had
many
cavaliers
who
came
to
talk
with
them
for
a
few
minutes
to
tell
them
what
was
doing
or
not
doing
yonder
where
the
hounds
were
hidden
in
thicket
or
coppice
but
henri
de
malfort
was
their
most
constant
attendant
he
rarely
left
them
and
dawdled
through
the
earlier
half
of
an
october
day
walking
his
horse
from
point
to
point
or
dismounting
at
sheltered
corners
to
stand
and
talk
at
lady
fareham
side
with
a
patience
that
made
angela
wonder
at
the
contrast
between
english
headlong
eagerness
crashing
and
splashing
through
hedge
and
brook
and
french
indifference
i
have
not
fareham
passion
for
mud
he
explained
to
her
when
she
remarked
upon
his
lack
of
interest
in
the
chase
even
when
the
music
of
the
hounds
was
ringing
through
wood
and
valley
now
close
beside
them
anon
diminishing
in
the
distance
thin
in
the
thin
air
if
he
comes
not
home
at
dark
plastered
with
mire
from
boots
to
eyebrows
he
will
cry
like
alexander
have
lost
a
day
in
the
wide
fields
between
chilton
and
nettlebed
was
more
to
malfort
taste
and
it
was
a
sport
for
which
lady
fareham
expressed
a
certain
enthusiasm
and
for
which
she
attired
herself
to
the
perfection
of
picturesque
costume
her
were
marvels
of
embroidery
on
atlas
and
smooth
cloth
but
her
smartest
velvet
and
brocade
she
kept
for
the
sunny
mornings
when
with
hooded
peregrine
on
wrist
she
sallied
forth
intent
on
slaughter
angela
papillon
and
de
malfort
for
her
an
horse
to
amble
over
the
grass
with
her
and
the
dutch
falconer
to
tell
her
the
right
moment
at
which
to
slip
her
falcon
hood
the
nuns
at
the
ursuline
convent
would
scarcely
have
recognised
their
quondam
pupil
in
the
girl
on
the
grey
palfrey
whose
hair
flew
loose
under
a
beaver
hat
mingling
its
tresses
with
the
long
ostrich
plume
whose
trimly
fitting
jacket
had
a
masculine
air
which
only
accentuated
the
womanliness
of
the
fair
face
above
it
and
whose
complexion
somewhat
too
colourless
within
the
convent
walls
now
glowed
with
a
carnation
that
brightened
and
darkened
the
large
grey
eyes
into
new
beauty
that
life
was
a
revelation
to
the
girl
could
this
earth
hold
greater
bliss
than
to
roam
at
large
over
spacious
gardens
to
cross
the
river
sculling
her
boat
with
strong
hands
with
her
niece
henriette
otherwise
papillon
sitting
in
the
stern
to
steer
and
scream
instructions
to
the
novice
in
navigation
and
then
to
lose
themselves
in
the
woods
on
the
further
shore
to
wander
in
a
labyrinth
of
reddening
beeches
and
oaks
on
which
the
thick
foliage
still
kept
its
dusky
green
to
emerge
upon
open
lawns
where
the
pale
gold
birches
looked
like
fairy
trees
and
where
amber
and
crimson
toadstools
shone
like
jewels
on
the
skirts
of
the
dense
undergrowth
of
holly
and
hawthorn
the
liberty
of
it
all
the
delicious
feeling
of
freedom
the
release
from
convent
rules
and
convent
hours
bells
ringing
for
chapel
bells
ringing
for
meals
bells
ringing
to
mark
the
end
of
the
brief
recreation
a
perpetual
ringing
and
drilling
which
had
made
conventual
life
a
dull
machine
working
always
in
the
same
grooves
oh
this
liberty
this
variety
this
beauty
in
all
things
around
and
about
her
how
the
young
glad
soul
newly
escaped
from
prison
revelled
and
expatiated
in
its
freedom
papillon
who
at
ten
years
old
had
skimmed
the
cream
off
all
the
simple
pleasures
appointed
herself
her
instructress
in
most
things
and
taught
her
to
row
with
some
help
from
lord
fareham
who
was
an
expert
waterman
and
at
the
same
time
tried
to
teach
her
to
despise
the
country
and
all
rustic
pleasures
except
hunting
although
in
her
inmost
heart
the
minx
preferred
the
liberty
of
oxfordshire
woods
to
the
splendour
of
fareham
house
where
she
was
cooped
in
a
nursery
with
her
for
the
greater
part
of
her
time
and
was
only
exhibited
like
a
doll
to
her
mother
fine
company
or
seated
upon
a
cushion
to
tinkle
a
saraband
and
display
her
precocious
talent
on
the
guitar
which
she
played
almost
as
badly
as
lady
fareham
herself
at
whose
feeble
endeavours
even
the
courteous
de
malfort
laughed
never
was
sister
kinder
than
hyacinth
impelled
by
that
impulsive
sweetness
which
was
her
chief
characteristic
and
also
it
might
be
moved
to
lavish
generosity
by
some
scruples
of
conscience
with
regard
to
her
will
her
first
business
was
to
send
for
the
best
milliner
in
oxford
a
london
madam
who
had
followed
her
court
customers
to
the
university
town
and
to
order
everything
that
was
beautiful
and
seemly
for
a
young
person
of
quality
i
implore
you
not
to
make
me
too
fine
dearest
pleaded
angela
who
was
more
horrified
at
the
milliner
painted
face
and
exuberant
figure
than
charmed
by
the
contents
of
the
baskets
which
she
had
brought
with
her
in
the
spacious
leather
coach
velvets
and
brocades
hoods
and
gloves
silk
stockings
fans
perfumes
and
pulvilios
and
scented
boxes
all
of
which
the
woman
spread
out
upon
lady
fareham
embroidered
satin
bed
for
the
young
lady
admiration
i
pray
you
remember
that
i
am
accustomed
to
have
only
two
gowns
a
black
and
a
grey
you
will
make
me
afraid
of
my
image
in
the
glass
if
you
dress
me
like
like
she
glanced
from
her
sister
bodice
to
the
far
more
appalling
charms
of
the
milliner
which
a
gauze
kerchief
rather
emphasised
than
concealed
and
could
find
no
proper
conclusion
for
her
sentence
nay
sweetheart
let
not
thy
modesty
take
fright
thou
shalt
be
clad
as
demurely
as
the
nun
thou
hast
escaped
being
sable
stole
of
cyprus
lawn
over
thy
decent
shoulders
drawn
we
will
have
no
blacks
but
as
much
decency
as
you
choose
you
will
mark
the
distinction
between
my
sister
and
your
maids
of
honour
lewin
she
is
but
a
in
our
modish
world
and
must
be
dressed
as
modestly
as
you
can
contrive
to
be
consistent
with
the
fashion
oh
my
lady
i
catch
your
ladyship
meaning
and
your
instructions
shall
be
carried
out
as
far
as
can
be
without
making
a
savage
of
the
young
lady
i
know
what
some
young
ladies
are
when
they
first
come
to
court
i
had
fuss
enough
with
miss
hamilton
before
i
could
persuade
her
to
have
her
bodice
cut
like
a
christian
and
even
the
beautiful
miss
brooks
were
all
for
high
tuckers
and
when
i
began
to
make
for
them
but
they
soon
came
round
and
now
with
my
lady
denham
it
is
always
lewin
do
you
call
that
the
right
cut
for
a
bosom
udsbud
woman
you
have
made
the
curve
half
deep
enough
and
with
my
lady
chesterfield
it
is
if
they
say
my
legs
are
thick
and
ugly
i
let
them
know
my
shoulders
are
worth
looking
at
give
me
your
scissors
creature
and
then
with
her
own
delicate
hand
she
will
scoop
me
a
good
inch
off
the
satin
till
i
am
fit
to
swoon
at
seeing
the
cold
steel
against
her
flesh
lewin
talked
with
but
little
interruption
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
while
measuring
her
new
customer
showing
her
and
exhibiting
the
wares
she
had
brought
the
greater
number
of
which
hyacinth
insisted
on
buying
for
angela
who
was
horrified
at
the
slanderous
innuendoes
that
dropped
in
casual
abundance
from
the
painted
lips
of
the
milliner
horrified
too
that
her
sister
could
loll
back
in
her
armchair
and
laugh
at
the
woman
coarse
and
malignant
talk
indeed
sister
you
are
far
too
generous
and
you
have
overpowered
me
with
gifts
she
said
when
the
milliner
had
curtsied
herself
out
of
the
room
for
i
fear
my
own
income
will
never
pay
for
all
these
costly
things
three
pounds
i
think
she
said
was
the
price
of
the
mazarine
hood
alone
and
there
are
stockings
and
gloves
innumerable
mon
ange
while
you
are
with
me
your
own
income
is
but
for
charities
and
vails
i
will
have
it
spent
for
nothing
else
you
know
how
rich
the
marquise
has
made
me
while
i
believe
fareham
is
a
kind
of
modern
croesus
though
we
do
not
boast
of
his
wealth
for
all
that
is
most
substantial
in
his
fortune
comes
from
his
mother
whose
father
was
a
great
merchant
trading
with
spain
and
the
indies
all
through
james
reign
and
luckier
in
the
hunt
for
gold
than
poor
raleigh
never
must
you
talk
to
me
of
obligation
are
we
not
sisters
and
was
it
not
a
mere
accident
that
made
me
the
elder
and
madame
de
montrond
i
have
no
words
to
thank
you
for
so
much
kindness
i
will
only
say
i
am
so
happy
here
that
i
could
never
have
believed
there
was
such
full
content
on
this
sinful
earth
wait
till
we
are
in
london
ang√©lique
here
we
endure
existence
it
is
only
in
london
that
we
live
nay
i
believe
the
country
will
always
please
me
better
than
the
town
but
sister
do
you
not
hate
that
lewin
that
horrid
painted
face
and
evil
tongue
my
dearest
child
one
hates
a
milliner
for
the
spoiling
of
a
bodice
or
the
ill
cut
of
a
sleeve
not
for
her
character
i
believe
lewin
is
among
the
worst
and
that
she
has
had
as
many
intrigues
as
lady
castlemaine
as
for
her
painting
doubtless
she
does
that
to
remind
her
customers
that
she
sells
alabaster
powder
and
ceruse
nay
if
she
wants
to
disgust
them
with
painted
faces
she
has
but
to
show
her
own
i
grant
she
lays
the
stuff
on
badly
i
hope
if
i
live
to
have
as
many
wrinkles
i
shall
fill
them
better
than
she
does
yet
who
can
tell
what
a
hideous
toad
she
might
be
in
her
natural
skin
it
may
be
christian
charity
that
induces
her
to
paint
and
so
to
spare
us
the
sight
of
a
monster
she
will
make
thee
a
beauty
ange
be
sure
of
that
for
satin
or
velvet
birthday
or
gala
gowns
nobody
can
beat
her
the
wretch
has
had
thousands
of
my
money
so
i
ought
to
know
but
for
thy
and
we
want
the
firmer
grip
of
a
man
hand
those
must
be
made
by
roget
a
frenchman
yes
child
one
only
accepts
british
workmanship
when
a
parisian
artist
is
not
to
be
had
clever
as
lewin
is
if
i
want
to
eclipse
my
dearest
enemy
on
any
special
occasion
i
send
manningtree
across
the
channel
or
ask
de
malfort
to
let
his
valet
who
spends
his
life
in
transit
like
a
messenger
bring
me
the
latest
confection
from
the
rue
de
richelieu
what
infinite
trouble
about
a
gown
and
for
you
who
would
look
lovely
in
anything
tush
child
you
have
never
seen
me
in
if
ever
you
should
surprise
me
in
an
ill
gown
you
will
see
how
much
the
feathers
make
the
bird
poets
and
may
pretend
to
believe
that
we
need
no
embellishment
from
art
but
the
very
men
who
write
all
that
romantic
nonsense
are
the
first
to
court
a
woman
and
there
are
few
of
them
who
could
calculate
with
any
exactness
the
relation
of
beauty
to
its
surroundings
that
is
why
women
go
deep
into
debt
to
their
milliners
and
would
sooner
be
dead
in
graveclothes
than
alive
in
an
mantua
angela
could
not
be
in
her
sister
company
for
a
month
without
discovering
that
lady
fareham
whole
life
was
given
up
to
the
worship
of
the
trivial
she
was
kind
she
was
amiable
generous
even
to
recklessness
she
was
not
irreligious
heard
mass
and
went
to
confession
as
often
as
the
hard
conditions
of
an
alien
and
jealously
treated
church
would
allow
had
never
disputed
the
truth
of
any
tenet
that
was
taught
her

of
serious
views
of
an
earnest
consideration

children
hyacinth
fareham
was
as
incapable
as
her
daughter
indeed
it
sometimes
seemed
to
angela
that
the
child
had
broader
and
deeper
thoughts
than
the
mother
and
saw
her
surroundings
with
a
shrewder
and
clearer
eye
despite
the
natural
frivolity
of
childhood
and
the
exuberance
of
a
fine
physique
it
was
not
for
the
younger
sister
to
teach
the
elder
nor
did
angela
deem
herself
capable
of
teaching
her
nature
was
thoughtful
and
earnest
but
she
lacked
that
experience
of
life
which
can
alone
give
the
thinker
a
broad
and
philosophic
view
of
other
people
conduct
she
was
still
far
from
the
stage
of
existence
in
which
to
understand
all
is
to
pardon
all
she
beheld
the
life
about
her
with
wonder
and
bewilderment
it
was
so
pleasant
so
full
of
beauty
and
variety
yet
things
were
said
and
done
that
shocked
her
there
was
nothing
in
her
sister
own
behaviour
to
alarm
her
modesty
but
to
hear
her
sister
talk
of
other
women
conduct
outraged
all
her
ideas
of
decency
and
virtue
if
there
were
really
such
wickedness
in
the
world
women
so
shameless
and
vile
was
it
right
that
good
women
should
know
of
them
that
pure
lips
should
speak
of
their
iniquity
she
was
still
more
shocked
when
hyacinth
talked
of
lady
castlemaine
with
a
indulgence
there
is
something
fine
about
her
lady
fareham
said
one
day
in
spite
of
her
tempers
and
pranks
what
cried
angela
aghast
having
thought
these
creatures
unrecognised
by
any
honest
woman
do
you
know
her
that
lady
castlemaine
of
whom
you
have
told
me
such
dreadful
things
vrai
ai
dit
des
raides
mon
ange
in
town
one
must
needs
know
everybody
though
i
doubt
that
after
not
returning
her
visit
day
i
shall
be
in
her
black
books
and
in
somebody
else
she
has
never
been
one
of
my
intimates
if
i
were
often
at
whitehall
i
should
have
to
be
friends
with
her
but
fareham
is
jealous
of
court
influences
and
i
am
only
allowed
to
appear
on
gala
nights
perhaps
not
a
times
in
a
season
there
is
a
distinction
in
not
showing
one
self
often
but
it
is
provoking
to
hear
of
the
frolics
and
jollities
which
go
on
every
day
and
every
night
and
from
which
i
am
banished
it
mattered
little
while
the
was
at
somerset
house
for
her
court
ranked
higher
and
was
certainly
more
refined
in
its
splendour
than
her
son
ragamuffin
herd
but
now
she
is
gone
i
shall
miss
our
intellectual
and
wish
myself
in
the
rue
thomas
du
louvre
where
the
h√¥tel
du
rambouillet
even
in
its
decline
offers
a
finer
style
of
company
than
anything
you
will
see
in
england
sister
i
fear
you
left
half
your
heart
in
france
nay
sweet
perhaps
some
of
it
has
followed
me
answered
hyacinth
with
a
blush
and
an
enigmatic
smile
i
am
not
a
woman
to
make
a
fuss
about
hearts
there
is
not
a
grain
of
tragedy
in
my
composition
i
am
like
that
girl
in
the
play
we
saw
at
oxford
day
fletcher
was
it
or
shakespeare
star
danced
and
under
that
was
i
born
yes
i
was
born
under
a
dancing
star
and
i
shall
never
break
my
heart
for
love
but
you
regret
paris
paris
means
my
girlhood
and
were
you
to
take
me
back
there
you
could
not
make
me
seventeen
again
and
so
where
the
use
i
should
see
wrinkles
in
the
faces
of
my
friends
and
should
know
that
they
were
seeing
the
same
ugly
lines
in
mine
indeed
ange
i
think
it
is
my
youth
i
sigh
for
rather
than
the
friends
i
lived
with
they
were
such
merry
days
battles
and
sieges
in
the
provinces
parliaments
disputing
here
and
there
cond√©
in
and
out
of
prison
now
the
king
loyal
servant
now
in
arms
against
him
swords
clashing
cannon
roaring
under
our
very
windows
alarm
bells
pealing
cries
of
fire
barricades
in
the
streets
and
amidst
it
all
lute
and
theorbo
and
madrigals
dancing
and
and
foolish
practical
jests
one
could
not
take
the
smallest
step
in
life
but
one
of
the
wits
would
make
a
song
about
it
oh
it
was
a
boisterous
time
and
we
were
all
mad
i
think
so
lightly
did
we
reckon
life
and
death
even
when
the
cannon
slew
some
of
our
noblest
and
the
finest
saloons
were
hung
with
black
you
have
done
less
than
live
ang√©lique
not
to
have
lived
in
that
time
hyacinth
loved
to
ring
the
changes
on
her
sister
name
angela
was
too
english
and
sounded
too
much
like
the
name
of
a
nun
but
ang√©lique
suggested
one
of
the
most
enchanting
personalities
in
that
brilliant
circle
on
which
lady
fareham
so
often
rhapsodised
this
was
the
beautiful
ang√©lique
paulet
whose
father
invented
the
tax
called
by
his
name
la
paulette
a
financial
measure
which
was
the
main
cause
of
the
first
fronde
war
i
only
knew
her
when
she
was
between
fifty
and
sixty
said
lady
fareham
but
she
hardly
looked
forty
and
she
was
still
handsome
in
spite
of
her
red
hair
her
admirers
called
it
but
my
love
it
was
as
red
as
that
scullion
we
saw
in
the
poultry
yard
yesterday
she
was
a
reigning
beauty
at
three
courts
and
had
a
crowd
of
adorers
when
she
was
only
fourteen
ah
papillon
you
may
open
your
eyes
what
will
you
be
at
fourteen
still
playing
with
your
babies
or
mad
about
your
shock
dogs
i
dare
swear
i
gave
my
babies
to
the
housekeeper
last
year
said
papillon
much
offended
when
father
gave
me
the
peregrine
i
only
care
for
live
things
now
i
am
old
and
at
fourteen
thou
wilt
be
an
awkward
wench
that
will
frighten
away
all
my
admirers
yet
not
be
worth
the
trouble
of
a
compliment
on
thine
own
account
i
want
no
such
stuff
cried
papillon
do
you
think
i
would
like
a
french
fop
always
at
my
elbow
as
monsieur
de
malfort
is
ever
at
yours
i
love
hunting
and
hawking
and
a
man
that
can
ride
and
shoot
and
row
and
fight
like
father
or
sir
denzil
warner
not
a
man
who
thinks
more
of
his
ribbons
and
periwig
and
than
of
killing
his
fox
or
flying
his
falcon
oh
you
are
beginning
to
have
opinions
sighed
hyacinth
i
am
indeed
an
old
woman
go
and
find
yourself
something
to
play
with
alive
or
dead
you
are
vastly
too
clever
for
my
company
i
go
and
saddle
brownie
will
you
come
for
a
ride
aunt
angy
yes
dear
if
her
ladyship
does
not
want
me
at
home
her
ladyship
knows
your
heart
is
in
the
fields
and
woods
yes
sweetheart
saddle
your
pony
and
order
your
aunt
horse
and
a
pair
of
grooms
to
take
care
of
you
the
child
ran
off
rejoicing
precocious
little
devil
she
will
pick
up
all
our
jargon
before
she
is
in
her
teens
dear
sister
if
you
talk
so
indiscreetly
before
her
indiscreet
am
i
really
so
indiscreet
that
is
fareham
word
i
believe
i
was
born
so
but
i
was
telling
you
about
your
namesake
mademoiselle
paulet
she
began
to
reign
when
henri
was
king
and
no
doubt
he
was
one
of
her
most
ardent
admirers
do
look
frightened
she
was
always
a
model
of
virtue
mademoiselle
scud√®ry
has
devoted
pages
to
painting
her
perfections
under
an
oriental
alias
she
sang
she
danced
she
talked
divinely
she
did
everything
better
than
everybody
else
priests
and
bishops
praised
her
and
after
changes
and
losses
and
troubles
she
died
far
from
paris
a
spinster
nearly
sixty
years
old
it
was
a
paltry
finish
to
a
life
that
began
in
a
blaze
of
glory
chapter
viii
superior
to
fashion
at
oxford
angela
was
so
happy
as
to
be
presented
to
catharine
of
braganza
a
little
dark
woman
whose
attire
still
bore
some
traces
of
its
original
portuguese
heaviness
such
a
dress
clumsy
ugly
infinitely
rich
and
expensive
as
one
sees
in
old
portraits
of
spanish
and
netherlandish
matrons
in
which
every
elaborate
detail
of
the
costly
fabric
seems
to
have
been
devised
in
the
research
of
ugliness
she
saw
the
king
also
met
him
casually
she
walking
with
her
while
lady
fareham
and
her
friends
ran
from
shop
to
shop
in
the
high
street
in
magdalen
college
grounds
a
group
of
beauties
and
a
family
of
spaniels
fawning
upon
him
as
he
sauntered
slowly
or
stopped
to
feed
the
swans
that
swam
close
by
the
bank
keeping
pace
with
him
and
stretching
long
necks
in
greedy
solicitation
the
loveliest
woman
angela
had
ever
seen
tall
built
like
a
goddess
walked
on
the
king
right
hand
she
carried
a
heap
of
broken
bread
in
the
satin
petticoat
which
she
held
up
over
one
white
arm
while
with
her
other
hand
she
gave
the
pieces
one
by
one
to
the
king
angela
saw
that
as
each
hunch
changed
hands
the
royal
fingers
touched
the
tapering
and
tried
to
detain
them
fareham
took
off
his
hat
bowed
low
in
a
grave
and
stately
salutation
and
passed
on
but
charles
called
him
back
nay
fareham
has
the
world
grown
so
dull
that
you
have
nothing
to
tell
us
this
november
morning
indeed
sir
i
fear
that
my
riverside
hermitage
can
afford
very
little
news
that
could
interest
your
majesty
or
these
ladies
a
fox
gone
to
ground
an
otter
killed
among
your
reeds
or
a
hawk
in
the
sulks
is
an
event
in
the
country
anything
would
be
a
relief
from
the
weekly
total
of
london
deaths
which
is
our
chief
subject
of
conversation
or
the
general
complaints
that
there
is
no
one
in
town
but
himself
to
transact
business
or
dismal
prophecies
of
a
nonconformist
rebellion
that
is
to
follow
the
five
mile
act
the
group
of
ladies
stared
at
angela
in
a
smiling
silence
one
haughtier
than
the
rest
standing
a
little
aloof
she
was
older
and
of
a
more
audacious
loveliness
than
the
lady
who
carried
broken
bread
in
her
petticoat
but
she
too
was
splendidly
beautiful
as
a
goddess
on
a
painted
ceiling
and
as
much
painted
perhaps
angela
contemplated
her
with
the
reverence
youth
gives
to
consummate
beauty
unaware
that
she
was
admiring
the
notorious
barbara
palmer
fareham
waited
hat
in
hand
grave
almost
to
sullenness
it
was
not
for
him
to
do
more
than
reply
to
his
majesty
remarks
nor
could
he
retire
till
dismissed
you
have
a
strange
face
at
your
side
man
pray
introduce
the
lady
said
the
king
smiling
at
angela
whose
vivid
blush
was
as
fresh
as
miss
stewart
had
been
a
year
or
two
ago
before
she
had
her
first
quarrel
with
lady
castlemaine
or
rode
in
gramont
glass
coach
or
gave
her
classic
profile
to
embellish
the
coin
of
the
realm
the
common
drudge
man
and
man
i
have
the
honour
to
present
my
mistress
kirkland
to
your
majesty
the
king
shook
hands
with
angela
in
the
easiest
way
as
if
he
had
been
mortal
welcome
to
our
poor
court
mistress
kirkland
your
father
was
my
friend
and
companion
in
the
evil
days
they
starved
together
at
beverley
and
rode
side
by
side
through
the
warwickshire
lanes
to
suffer
the
insolence
of
coventry
i
have
not
forgotten
if
i
had
i
have
a
monitor
yonder
to
remind
me
glancing
in
the
direction
of
a
gentleman
stately
and
sober
of
attire
who
was
walking
slowly
towards
them
the
chancellor

a
living
chronicle
and
his
conversation
chiefly
consists
in
reminiscences
of

would
rather
forget

an
invention
of
old
nick

the

wants
to
remember
anything
except
what
cards
are
out
and
what
are

should
be
the
last
to
cultivate
mnemonics
for

for
your

your
father
in

sweet
mistress
angela
faltered
a
negative
as
if
with
somebody
else
voice
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
a
swarthy
man
wearing
a
ribbon
and
a
star
a
man
with
whom
his
intimates
jested
in
shameless
freedom
a
man
whom
the
town
called
rowley
after
some
ignominious
quadruped
a
man
who
had
distinguished
himself
neither
in
the
field
nor
in
the
by
any
excellence
above
the
majority
since
the
wit
men
praised
has
resolved
itself
for
posterity
into
half
a
dozen
happy
repartees
only
this
but
he
was
a
king
a
crowned
and
anointed
king
and
even
angela
who
was
less
frivolous
and
shallow
than
most
women
stood
before
him
abashed
and
dazzled
his
majesty
bowed
a
gracious
adieu
yawned
flung
another
crust
to
the
swans
and
sauntered
on
the
stewart
whispering
in
his
ear
the
castlemaine
talking
loud
to
her
neighbour
lady
chesterfield
this
latter
lady
very
pretty
very
bold
and
mischievous
newly
restored
to
the
court
after
exile
with
her
jealous
husband
at
his
mansion
in
wales
they
were
gone
charles
to
be
by
lord
clarendon
who
waited
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
walk
the
ladies
to
wander
as
they
pleased
till
the
dinner
they
were
gone
like
a
dream
of
beauty
and
splendour
and
fareham
and
angela
pursued
their
walk
by
the
river
grey
in
the
sunless
november
well
sister
you
have
seen
the
man
whom
we
brought
back
in
a
whirlwind
of
loyalty
five
years
ago
and
for
whose
sake
we
rebuilt
the
fabric
of
monarchical
government
do
you
think
we
are
much
the
gainers
by
that
tempest
of
enthusiasm
which
blew
us
home
charles
the
second
we
had
suffered
all
the
trouble
of
the
change
to
a
republic
a
life
that
should
have
been
sacred
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
principles
of
liberty
while
abhorring
the
regicides
we
might
have
profited
by
their
crime
we
might
have
been
a
free
state
like
the
united
provinces
do
you
think
we
are
better
off
with
a
king
like
rowley
to
amuse
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
i
detest
the
idea
of
a
republic
youth
worships
the
supernatural
in
anointed
kings
think
not
that
i
am
opposed
to
a
constitutional
monarchy
so
long
as
it
works
well
for
the
majority
but
when
england
had
with
such
terrible
convulsions
shaken
off
all
those
shackles
and
trappings
of
royalty
and
when
the
ship
so
lightened
had
sailed
so
steadily
with
no
ballast
but
common
sense
does
it
not
seem
almost
a
pity
to
undo
what
has
been
done
to
begin
again
the
long
procession
of
good
kings
and
bad
kings
foolish
or
wise
for
the
sake
of
such
a
man
as
yonder
saunterer
with
a
glance
towards
the
british
sultan
and
his
harem
england
was
never
better
governed
than
by
cromwell
he
continued
she
was
tranquil
at
home
and
victorious
abroad
admired
and
feared
mazarin
while
pretending
to
be
the
faithful
friend
of
charles

the
obsequious
courtier
of
oliver
the
finest
form
of
government
is
a
limited
despotism

how
france
prospered
under
the
sagacious
tyrant
louis
the
eleventh
under
the
sully
under
pure
reason
incarnate
in
richelieu
whether
you
call
your
tyrant
king
or
protector
minister
or
president
matters
nothing
it
is
the
man
and
not
the
institution
the
mind
and
not
the
machinery
that
is
wanted
i
did
not
know
you
were
a
republican
like
sir
denzil
warner
i
am
nothing
now
i
have
left
off
being
a
soldier
i
have
no
strong
opinions
about
anything
i
am
a
looker

and
life
seems
little
more
real
to
me
than
a

a
different
stamp

sir
denzil

was
their
neighbour
at

had
met
him
often
enough
for
them
to
become
friends
he
had
ridden
by

side
with

perfect
herself

of
sculls
hyacinth
has
her
fancies
about
warner
fareham
said
presently
as
they
strolled
along
there
was
a
significance
in
his
tone
that
the
girl
could
not
mistake
more
especially
as
her
sister
had
not
been
reticent
about
those
notions
to
which
fareham
alluded
hyacinth
has
fancies
about
many
things
she
said
blushing
a
little
fareham
noted
the
slightness
of
the
blush
i
verily
believe
that
handsome
youth
has
found
you
adamant
he
said
after
a
thoughtful
silence
yet
you
might
easily
choose
a
worse
suitor
your
sister
has
often
the
strangest
whims
about
but
in
this
fancy
i
did
not
oppose
her
it
would
be
a
very
suitable
alliance
i
hope
your
lordship
does
not
begin
to
think
me
a
burden
on
your
household
faltered
angela
wounded
by
his
air
in
disposing
of
her
when
you
and
my
sister
are
tired
of
me
i
can
go
back
to
my
convent
what
return
to
those
imprisoning
walls
immure
your
sweet
youth
in
a
cloister
not
for
the
indies
i
would
not
suffer
such
a
sacrifice
tired
of
you
i
so
deeply
bound
i
who
owe
you
my
life
i
who
looked
up
out
of
a
burning
hell
of
pain
and
madness
and
saw
an
angel
standing
by
my
bed
tired
of
you
indeed
you
know
me
better
than
to
think
so
badly
of
me
were
it
but
in
one
flash
of
thought
you
can
need
no
protestations
from
me
only
as
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
living
in
an
age
that
is
full
of
peril
for
women
i
should
like
to
see
you
married
to
a
good
and
true
man
such
as
denzil
warner
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
angela
answered
coldly
but
papillon
and
i
have
agreed
that
i
am
always
to
be
her
spinster
aunt
and
am
to
keep
her
house
when
she
is
married
and
wear
a
linsey
gown
and
a
bunch
of
keys
at
my
girdle
like
hubbuck
at
chilton
that
just
like
henriette
she
takes
after
her
mother
and
thinks
that
this
globe
and
all
the
people
upon
it
were
created
principally
for
her
pleasure
the
americas
to
give
her
chocolate
the
indian
isles
to
sweeten
it
for
her
the
ocean
tides
to
bring
her
feathers
and
finery
she
is
her
own
centre
and
circumference
like
her
mother
you
should
not
say
such
an
ill
thing
of
your
wife
fareham
said
angela
deeply
shocked
hyacinth
is
not
one
to
look
into
the
heart
of
things
she
has
too
happy
a
disposition
for
grave
thoughts
but
i
will
swear
that
she
loves
you
ay
almost
to
reverence
yes
to
reverence
to
over
much
reverence
perhaps
she
might
have
given
a
freer
fonder
love
to
a
more
amiable
man
i
have
some
strain
of
my
unhappy
kinsman
temper
perhaps
the
disposition
that
keeps
a
wife
at
a
distance
he
managed
to
make
three
wives
afraid
of
him
and
it
was
darkly
rumoured
that
he
killed
one
strafford
a
murderer
no
no
not
by
intent
an
accident
only
an
accident
they
who
most
hated
him
pretended
that
he
pushed
her
from
him
somewhat
roughly
when
she
was
least
able
to
bear
roughness
and
that
the
after
consequences
of
the
blow
were
fatal
he
was
one
of
the
doomed
always
you
see
he
knew
that
himself
and
told
his
bosom
friend
that
he
was
not
the
brand
of
misfortune
was
upon
him
even
at
the
height
of
his
power
you
may
read
his
destiny
in
his
face
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
time
angela
depressed
and
unhappy
it
seemed
as
if
fareham
had
lifted
a
mask
and
shown
her
his
real
countenance
with
all
the
lines
that
tell
a
life
history
she
had
suspected
that
he
was
not
happy
that
the
joyous
existence
amidst
fairest
surroundings
which
seemed
so
exquisite
to
her
was
dull
and
vapid
for
him
she
could
but
think
that
he
was
like
her
father
and
that
action
and
danger
were
necessary
to
him
and
that
it
was
only
this
rustic
tranquillity
that
weighed
upon
his
spirits
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
i
would
speak
slightingly
of
your
sister
fareham
resumed
after
that
silent
interval
it
were
indeed
an
ill
thing
in
me
most
of
all
to
disparage
her
in
your
hearing
she
is
lovely
accomplished
learned
even
after
the
fashion
of
the
rue
thomas
du
louvre
she
used
to
shine
among
the
brightest
at
the
scud√®rys
saturday
parties
which
were
the
most
wearisome
assemblies
i
ever
ran
away
from
the
match
was
made
for
us
by
others
and
i
was
her
betrothed
husband
before
i
saw
her
yet
i
loved
her
at
first
sight
who
could
help
loving
a
face
as
fair
as
morning
over
the
eastward
hills
a
voice
as
sweet
as
the
nightingales
in
the
tuileries
garden
she
was
so
young
a
child
almost
so
gentle
and
confiding
and
to
see
her
now
with
papillon
is
to
question
which
is
the
younger
mother
or
daughter
love
her
why
of
course
i
love
her
i
loved
her
then
i
love
her
now
her
beauty
has
but
ripened
with
the
passing
years
and
she
has
walked
the
furnace
of
fine
company
in
two
cities
and
has
never
been
seared
by
fire
love
her
could
a
man
help
loving
beauty
and
frankness
and
a
natural
innocence
which
can
not
be
spoiled
even
by
the
knowledge
of
things
evil
even
by
daily
contact
with
sin
in
high
places
again
there
was
a
silence
and
then
in
a
deeper
tone
after
a
long
sigh
fareham
said
i
love
and
honour
my
wife
i
adore
my
children
yet
i
am
alone
angela
and
i
shall
be
alone
till
death
i
do
understand
oh
yes
you
do
you
understand
as
well
as
i
who
suffer
my
wife
and
i
love
each
other
dearly
if
she
have
a
fit
of
the
vapours
or
an
aching
tooth
i
am
wretched
but
we
have
never
been
companions
the
things
that
she
loves
are
charmless
for
me
she
is
enchanted
with
people
from
whom
i
run
away
is
it
companionship
do
you
think
for
me
to
look
on
while
she
walks
a
coranto
or
tosses
shuttlecocks
with
de
malfort
roxalana
is
as
much
my
companion
when
i
admire
her
on
the
stage
from
my
seat
in
the
pit
there
are
times
when
my
wife
seems
no
nearer
to
me
than
a
beautiful
picture
if
i
sit
in
a
corner
and
listen
to
her
pretty
babble
about
the
last
fan
she
bought
at
the
middle
exchange
or
the
last
witless
comedy
she
saw
at
the
theatre
is
that
companionship
think
you
i
may
be
charmed
as
i
was
charmed
ten
years
ago
with
the
silvery
sweetness
of
her
voice
with
the
graceful
turn
of
her
head
the
white
roundness
of
her
throat
at
least
i
am
constant
there
is
no
change
in
her
or
in
me
we
are
just
as
near
and
just
as
far
apart
as
when
the
priest
joined
our
hands
at
eustache
and
it
must
be
so
to
the
end
i
suppose
and
i
think
the
fault
is
in
me
i
am
out
of
joint
with
the
world
i
live
in
i
can
not
set
myself
in
tune
with
their
new
music
i
look
back
and
remember
and
regret
yet
hardly
know
why
i
remember
or
what
i
regret
again
a
silence
briefer
than
the
last
and
he
went
on
do
you
think
it
strange
that
i
talk
so
freely
to
you
who
are
scarce
more
than
a
child
less
learned
than
henriette
in
worldly
knowledge
it
is
a
comfort
sometimes
to
talk
of
one
self
of
what
one
has
missed
as
well
as
of
what
one
has
and
you
have
such
an
air
of
being
wise
beyond
your
years
wise
in
all
thoughts
that
are
not
of
the
world
thoughts
of
things
of
which
there
is
no
truck
at
the
exchanges
which
no
one
buys
or
sells
at
abingdon
fair
and
you
are
so
near
allied
to
me
a
sister
i
never
had
a
sister
of
my
own
blood
angela
i
was
an
only
child
solitude
was
my
portion
i
lived
alone
with
my
tutor
and
a
poor
relation
of
my
mother
alone
in
a
house
that
was
mostly
deserted
for
lord
and
lady
fareham
were
in
london
with
the
king
till
the
troubles
brought
the
court
to
christchurch
and
them
to
chilton
i
have
had
few
in
whom
to
confide
and
you
remember
what
you
have
been
to
me
and
do
not
wonder
if
i
trust
you
more
than
others
thou
didst
go
down
to
the
very
grave
with
me
didst
pluck
me
out
of
the
pit
corruption
could
not
touch
a
creature
so
lovely
and
so
innocent
thou
didst
walk
unharmed
through
the
remembering
this
as
i
ever
must
remember
can
you
wonder
that
you
are
nearer
to
me
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
she
had
seated
herself
on
a
bench
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
river
and
her
dreaming
eyes
were
looking
far
away
along
the
dim
perspective
of
mist
and
water
bare
pollard
willows
ragged
sedges
her
head
drooped
a
little
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
and
one
ungloved
hand
hung
listlessly
at
her
side
he
bent
down
to
take
the
slender
hand
in
his
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
quickly
let
it
go
but
not
before
she
had
felt
his
tears
upon
it
she
looked
up
a
few
minutes
later
and
the
place
was
empty
her
tears
fell
thick
and
fast
never
before
had
she
suffered
this
exquisite
pain
sadness
so
intense
yet
touching
so
close
on
joy
she
sat
alone
in
the
inexpressible
melancholy
of
the
late
autumn
pale
mists
rising
from
the
river
dead
leaves
falling
and
fareham
tears
upon
her
hand
chapter
ix
in
a
puritan
house
how
quickly
the
days
passed
in
that
gay
household
at
chilton
and
yet
every
day
of
angela
life
held
so
much
of
action
and
emotion
that
looking
back
at
christmas
time
to
the
three
months
that
had
slipped
by
since
she
had
brought
fareham
from
his
sick
bed
to
his
country
home
she
could
but
experience
that
common
feeling
of
youth
in
such
circumstances
surely
it
was
half
a
lifetime
that
had
lapsed
or
else
she
by
some
subtle
and
supernatural
change
had
become
a
new
creature
she
thought
of
her
life
in
the
convent
thought
of
it
much
and
deeply
on
those
sunday
mornings
when
she
and
her
sister
and
de
malfort
and
a
score
or
so
of
servants
crept
quietly
to
a
room
in
the
heart
of
the
house
where
a
priest
who
had
been
fetched
from
oxford
in
lady
fareham
coach
said
mass
within
locked
doors
the
familiar
words
of
the
service
the
odour
of
the
incense
brought
back
the
old
time
the
unforgotten
atmosphere
the
dull
tranquillity
of
ten
years
which
had
been
as
one
year
by
reason
of
their
level
monotony
could
she
go
back
to
such
a
life
as
that
go
back
leave
all
she
loved
at
the
mere
suggestion
her
trembling
hand
was
stretched
out
involuntarily
to
clasp
her
niece
henriette
kneeling
beside
her
leave
them
leave
those
with
whom
and
for
whom
she
lived
leave
this
loving
child
her
sister
her
brother
fareham
had
told
her
to
call
him
brother
he
had
been
to
her
as
a
brother
with
all
a
brother
kindness
counselling
her
confiding
in
her
only
with
one
person
at
chilton
abbey
had
she
ever
conversed
as
seriously
as
with
fareham
and
that
person
was
sir
denzil
warner
who
at
five
and
twenty
was
more
serious
in
his
way
of
looking
at
serious
things
than
most
men
of
fifty
i
can
not
make
a
jest
of
life
he
said
once
in
reply
to
some
flippant
speech
of
de
malfort
it
is
too
painful
a
business
for
the
majority
what
has
that
to
do
with
us
the
minority
can
we
smooth
a
sick
pillow
by
pulling
a
long
face
we
shall
do
him
more
good
by
tossing
him
a
crown
if
he
be
poor
or
helping
to
build
him
a
hospital
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
night
winnings
at
ombre
long
faces
help
nobody
that
is
what
you
puritans
will
never
consider
no
but
if
the
long
faces
are
the
faces
of
men
who
think
something
may
come
of
their
thoughts
for
the
good
of
humanity
denzil
warner
was
the
only
person
who
ever
spoke
to
angela
of
her
religion
with
extreme
courtesy
and
with
gentle
excuses
for
his
temerity
in
touching
on
so
delicate
a
theme
he
ventured
to
express
his
abhorrence
of
the
superstitions
interwoven
with
the
romanist
creed
he
talked
as
one
who
had
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
blind
poet
talked
sometimes
in
the
very
words
of
john
milton
there
was
much
in
what
he
said
that
appealed
to
her
reason
but
there
was
no
charm
in
that
severer
form
of
worship
which
he
offered
in
exchange
for
her
own
he
was
frank
and
generous
he
had
a
fine
nature
but
was
too
much
given
to
judging
his
he
had
all
the
arrogance
of
puritanism
superadded
to
the
natural
arrogance
of
youth
that
has
never
known
humiliating
reverses
that
has
never
been
the
servant
of
circumstance
he
was
angela
senior
by
something
less
than
four
years
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
in
every
attribute
infinitely
her
superior
in
education
in
depth
of
thought
in
resolution
for
good
and
scorn
of
evil
if
he
loved
her
as
hyacinth
insisted
upon
declaring
there
was
nothing
of
youthful
impetuosity
in
his
passion
he
had
indeed
betrayed
his
sentiments
by
no
direct
speech
he
had
told
her
gravely
that
he
was
interested
in
her
and
deeply
concerned
that
one
so
worthy
and
so
amiable
should
have
been
brought
up
in
the
house
of
idolaters
should
have
been
taught
falsehood
instead
of
truth
she
stood
up
boldly
for
the
faith
of
her
maternal
ancestors
i
can
not
continue
your
friend
if
you
speak
evil
of
those
i
love
sir
denzil
she
said
could
you
have
seen
the
lives
of
those
good
ladies
of
the
ursuline
convent
their
unselfishness
their
charity
you
must
needs
have
respected
their
religion
i
can
not
think
why
you
love
to
say
hard
words
of
us
catholics
for
in
all
i
have
ever
heard
or
seen
of
the
lives
of
the
nonconformists
they
approach
us
far
more
nearly
in
their
principles
than
the
members
of
the
church
of
england
who
if
my
sister
does
not
paint
them
with
too
black
a
brush
practise
their
religion
with
a
laxity
and
indifference
that
would
go
far
to
turn
religion
to
a
jest
whatever
sir
denzil
ideas
might
be
upon
the
question
of
creed
and
he
did
not
scruple
to
tell
angela
that
he
thought
every
papist
foredoomed
to
everlasting
punishment
he
showed
so
much
pleasure
in
her
society
as
to
be
at
chilton
abbey
and
the
sharer
of
her
walks
and
rides
as
often
as
possible
lady
fareham
encouraged
his
visits
and
was
always
gracious
to
him
she
discovered
that
he
possessed
the
gift
of
music
though
not
in
the
same
remarkable
degree
as
henri
de
malfort
who
played
the
guitar
exquisitely
and
into
whose
hands
you
had
but
to
put
a
musical
instrument
for
him
to
extract
sweetness
from
it
lute
or
theorbo
viola
or
viol
di
gamba
treble
or
bass
came
alike
to
his
hand
and
ear
some
instruments
he
had
studied
with
some
his
skill
came
by
intuition
denzil
warner
performed
very
creditably
upon
the
organ
he
had
played
on
john
milton
organ
in
bride
church
when
he
was
a
boy
and
he
had
played
of
late
in
the
church
at
chalfont
giles
where
he
had
visited
milton
frequently
since
the
poet
had
left
his
lodgings
in
artillery
walk
carrying
his
family
and
his
books
to
that
sequestered
village
in
the
shelter
of
the
hills
between
uxbridge
and
beaconsfield
here
from
the
lips
of
his
sometime
tutor
the
puritan
had
heard
such
stories
of
the
court
as
made
him
hourly
expectant
of
exterminating
fires
doubtless
the
fire
would
have
come
as
it
came
upon
sodom
and
gomorrah
but
for
those
righteous
lives
of
the
nonconformists
which
redeemed
the
time
quiet
lives
in
dull
old
city
houses
in
streets
almost
as
narrow
as
those
which
milton
remembered
in
his
beloved
italy
streets
where
the
sun
looked
in
for
an
hour
shooting
golden
arrows
down
upon
the
casements
and
deepening
the
shadow
of
the
massive
timbers
that
held
up
the
overlapping
stories
looked
in
and
bade
good
night
within
an
hour
or
so
leaving
an
atmosphere
of
sober
grey
cool
and
quiet
and
dull
in
those
obscure
streets
and
alleys
where
the
great
traffic
of
cheapside
or
ludgate
sounded
like
the
murmur
of
a
sea
pious
men
and
women
worshipped
the
implacable
god
of
the
puritans
in
the
secret
chambers
of
those
narrow
streets
and
those
who
gathered
together
in
these
days
if
they
rejected
the
liturgy
of
the
church
of
england
must
indeed
be
few
and
must
meet
by
stealth
as
if
to
pray
or
preach
after
their
own
manner
were
a
crime
charles
within
a
year
or
so
of
his
general
amnesty
and
happy
restoration
had
made
such
worship
criminal
and
now
the
five
mile
act
lately
passed
at
oxford
had
rendered
the
restrictions
and
penalties
of
nonconformity
utterly
intolerable
men
were
lying
in
prison
here
and
there
about
merry
england
for
no
greater
offence
than
preaching
the
gospel
to
a
handful
of
people
but
that
a
puritan
tinker
should
moulder
for
a
dozen
years
in
a
damp
jail
could
count
for
little
against
the
blessed
fact
of
the
maypole
reinstated
in
the
strand
and
five
in
london
performing
ribald
comedies
till
but
recently
when
the
plague
shut
their
doors
milton
old
and
blind
and
somewhat
soured
by
domestic
disappointments
had
imparted
no
optimistic
philosophy
to
young
denzil
warner
whose
father
he
had
known
and
loved
the
fight
at
hopton
heath
had
made
denzil
fatherless
the
colonel
of
warner
horse
riding
to
his
death
in
the
last
fatal
charge
of
that
memorable
day
denzil
had
grown
up
under
the
prosperous
rule
of
the
protector
and
his
boyhood
had
been
spent
in
the
guardianship
of
a
most
watchful
and
mother
he
had
been
somewhat
and
it
may
be
in
that
tranquil
atmosphere
of
the
rich
house
but
not
all
lady
warner
tenderness
could
make
her
son
a
milksop
except
for
a
period
of
two
years
in
london
when
he
had
lived
under
the
roof
of
the
great
republican
a
docile
pupil
to
a
stern
but
kind
master
denzil
had
lived
mostly
under
the
open
sky
was
a
keen
sportsman
and
loved
the
country
with
almost
as
sensitive
a
love
as
his
quondam
master
and
present
friend
john
milton
and
it
was
perhaps
this
appreciation
of
rural
beauty
which
had
made
a
bond
of
friendship
between
the
great
poet
and
the
puritan
squire
you
have
a
knack
of
painting
rural
scenes
which
needs
but
to
be
joined
with
the
gift
of
music
to
make
you
a
poet
he
said
when
denzil
had
been
expatiating
upon
the
landscape
amidst
which
he
had
enjoyed
his
last
bout
of
falconry
or
his
last
run
with
his
couple
of
hounds
you
are
almost
as
the
power
of
sight
to
me
when
you
describe
those
downs
and
valleys
whose
every
shape
and
shadow
i
once
knew
so
well
alas
that
i
should
be
changed
so
much
and
they
so
little
it
is
one
thing
sir
to
feel
that
this
world
is
beautiful
and
another
to
find
golden
words
and
phrases
which
to
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
could
conjure
up
as
fair
a
landscape
as
claude
lorraine
ever
painted
those
sonorous
and
mellifluous
lines
which
you
were
so
gracious
as
to
repeat
to
me
forming
part
of
the
great
epic
which
the
world
is
waiting
for
bear
witness
to
the
power
that
can
turn
words
into
music
and
make
pictures
out
of
the
common
tongue
that
splendid
art
sir
is
but
given
to
one
man
in
a
century
or
in
several
centuries
since
i
know
but
dante
and
virgil
who
have
ever
equalled
your
vision
of
heaven
and
hell
do
not
me
denzil
in
thy
charity
to
poverty
and
affliction
it
is
pleasing
to
be
understood
by
a
youth
who
loves
hawk
and
hound
better
than
books
for
it
offers
the
promise
of
popular
appreciation
in
years
to
come
yet
the
world
is
so
little
athirst
for
my
epic
that
i
doubt
if
i
shall
find
a
bookseller
to
give
me
a
few
pounds
for
the
right
to
print
a
work
that
has
cost
me
years
of
thought
and
laborious
revision
but
at
least
it
has
been
my
consolation
in
the
long
blank
night
of
my
decay
and
has
saved
me
many
a
for
while
i
am
building
up
my
verses
and
engraving
line
after
line
upon
the
tablets
of
memory
i
can
forget
that
i
am
blind
and
poor
and
neglected
and
that
the
dear
saint
i
loved
was
snatched
from
me
in
the
noontide
of
our
happiness
denzil
talked
much
of
john
milton
in
his
conversations
with
angela
during
those
rides
or
rambles
in
which
papillon
was
their
only
chaperon
lady
fareham
sauntered
like
her
royal
master
but
she
rarely
walked
a
mile
at
a
stretch
and
she
was
pleased
to
encourage
the
rural
wanderings
that
brought
her
sister
and
warner
into
a
closer
intimacy
and
promised
well
for
the
success
of
her
matrimonial
scheme
i
believe
they
adore
each
other
already
she
told
fareham
one
morning
standing
by
his
side
in
the
great
stone
porch
to
watch
those
three
youthful
figures
ride
away
aunt
and
niece
side
by
side
on
palfrey
and
pony
with
denzil
for
their
cavalier
you
are
always
to
be
sure
of
anything
that
suits
your
own
fancy
dearest
answered
fareham
watching
them
to
the
curve
of
the
avenue
but
i
see
no
signs
of
favour
to
that
solemn
youth
in
your
sister
she
suffers
his
attentions
out
of
pure
civility
he
is
an
accomplished
horseman
having
given
all
his
life
to
learning
how
to
jump
a
fence
gracefully
and
his
company
is
at
least
better
than
a
groom
how
scornfully
you
jeer
at
him
oh
i
have
no
more
scorn
than
the
cavalier
natural
contempt
for
the
roundhead
a
hereditary
hatred
perhaps
you
say
such
hard
things
of
his
majesty
that
one
might
often
take
you
to
be
of
sir
denzil
way
of
thinking
i
never
think
about
the
king
i
only
wonder
i
may
sometimes
express
my
wonderment
too
freely
for
a
loyal
subject
i
can
not
vouch
for
angela
but
i
will
wager
that
he
is
deep
in
love
persisted
hyacinth
have
it
your
own
way
sweetheart
he
is
dull
enough
to
be
deep
in
debt
or
love
or
politics
anything
dismal
and
troublesome
answered
his
lordship
as
he
strolled
off
with
his
spaniels
not
those
dainty
toy
dogs
which
had
been
his
companions
at
the
gate
of
death
but
the
fine
shooting
dogs
that
lived
in
the
kennels
and
thought
it
doghood
highest
privilege
to
attend
their
lord
in
his
walks
whether
with
or
without
a
gun
his
lordship
kept
open
christmas
that
year
at
chilton
abbey
and
there
was
great
festivity
chiefly
devised
and
carried
out
by
the
household
as
fareham
and
his
wife
were
too
much
of
the
modern
fashion
and
too
cosmopolitan
in
their
ideas
to
appreciate
the
fuss
and
feasting
of
an
english
christmas
they
submitted
however
to
the
festival
as
arranged
for
them
by
manningtree
and
hubbuck
the
copious
feasting
for
servants
and
dependents
the
mummers
and
carolsingers
the
garlands
and
greenery
which
disguised
the
fine
old
tapestry
and
made
a
bower
of
the
vaulted
hall
everything
was
done
with
a
lavish
plenteousness
and
no
doubt
the
household
enjoyed
the
fun
and
feasting
all
the
more
because
of
that
dismal
season
of
a
few
years
back
when
all
christmas
ceremonies
had
been
denounced
as
idolatrous
and
when
the
members
of
the
anglican
church
had
assembled
for
their
christmas
service
secretly
in
private
houses
and
as
much
under
the
ban
of
the
law
as
the
nonconformists
were
now
angela
was
interested
in
everything
in
that
bright
world
where
all
things
were
new
the
children
piping
christmas
hymns
in
the
clear
cold
morning
enchanted
her
she
ran
down
to
kiss
and
fondle
the
smaller
among
them
and
finding
them
thinly
clad
promised
to
make
them
warm
cloaks
and
hoods
as
fast
as
her
fingers
could
sew
denzil
found
her
there
in
the
wide
snowy
space
before
the
porch
prattling
with
the
children
her
soft
brown
hair
blown
about
in
the
wind
and
he
was
moved
as
a
man
must
needs
be
moved
by
the
aspect
of
the
woman
that
he
loves
caressing
a
small
child
melted
almost
to
tears
by
the
thought
that
in
some
blessed
time
to
come
she
might
so
caress
only
more
warmly
a
child
whose
existence
should
be
their
bond
of
union
and
yet
being
both
shy
and
somewhat
cold
of
temperament
he
restrained
himself
and
greeted
her
only
as
a
friend
for
his
mother
influence
was
holding
him
back
urging
him
not
to
marry
a
papist
were
she
ever
so
lovely
or
lovable
he
had
known
angela
for
nearly
three
months
and
his
acquaintance
with
her
had
reached
this
point
of
intimacy
yet
lady
warner
had
never
seen
her
this
fact
distressed
him
and
he
had
tried
hard
to
awaken
his
interest
by
praises
of
the
fareham
family
and
of
angela
exquisite
character
but
the
scarlet
spectre
came
between
the
puritan
lady
and
the
house
of
fareham
there
is
nothing
you
can
tell
me
about
this
girl
upon
whom
i
fear
you
have
foolishly
set
your
affection
which
can
make
me
forget
that
she
has
been
nursed
and
swaddled
in
the
bondage
of
a
corrupt
church
taught
to
worship
idols
and
to
cherish
lying
traditions
while
the
light
of
holy
word
has
been
made
dark
for
her
she
is
young
enough
to
embrace
a
purer
creed
and
to
walk
by
the
clearer
light
that
leads
your
footsteps
mother
if
she
were
my
wife
i
should
not
despair
of
winning
her
to
think
as
we
do
and
in
all
the
length
of
england
was
there
no
young
woman
of
right
principles
fit
to
be
thy
wife
that
thou
must
needs
fall
into
the
snare
of
the
first
popish
witch
who
set
her
lure
for
thee
popish
witch
oh
mother
how
ill
you
can
conceive
the
image
of
my
dear
love
who
has
no
witchcraft
but
beauty
no
charm
so
potent
as
her
truth
and
innocency
i
know
them
these
children
of
the
scarlet
woman
and
i
know
their
works
and
the
fate
of
those
who
trust
them
the
late
king
weak
and
stubborn
as
he
was
might
have
been
alive
this
day
and
reigning
over
a
contented
people
but
for
that
fair
witch
who
ruled
him
it
was
the
sorceries
that
wrought
charles
ruin
if
thou
wouldst
but
see
my
angela
pleaded
the
son
with
a
caressing
arm
about
his
mother
spare
shoulders
thine
what
is
she
thine
pledged
and
promised
already
then
indeed
these
white
hairs
will
go
down
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
mother
i
doubt
if
thou
couldst
find
so
much
as
a
single
grey
hair
in
that
comely
head
of
thine
said
the
son
and
the
mother
smiled
in
the
midst
of
her
affliction
and
as
for
promise
there
has
been
none
i
have
said
no
word
of
love
nor
have
i
been
encouraged
to
speak
by
any
token
of
liking
on
the
lady
part
i
stand
aloof
and
admire
and
wonder
at
so
much
modesty
and
intelligence
in
lady
fareham
sister
let
me
bring
her
to
see
you
mother
this
is
your
house
denzil
were
you
to
fill
it
with
the
sons
and
daughters
of
belial
i
could
but
pray
that
your
eyes
might
be
opened
to
their
iniquity
i
could
not
shut
these
doors
against
you
or
your
companions
but
i
want
no
popish
women
here
ah
you
do
not
know
wait
until
you
have
seen
her
urged
denzil
with
the
lover
confidence
in
the
omnipotence
of
his
mistress
charms
and
now
on
this
christmas
day
there
came
the
opportunity
denzil
had
been
waiting
for
the
weather
was
cold
and
bright
the
landscape
was
blotted
out
with
snow
and
the
lake
in
chilton
park
offered
a
sound
surface
for
the
exercise
of
that
novel
amusement
of
skating
an
accomplishment
which
lord
fareham
had
acquired
while
in
the
low
countries
and
in
which
he
had
been
denzil
instructor
during
the
late
severe
weather
angela
at
her
entreaty
had
also
adventured
herself
upon
a
pair
of
skates
and
had
speedily
found
delight
in
the
swift
motion
which
seemed
to
her
like
the
flight
of
a
bird
skimming
the
steely
surface
of
the
frozen
lake
and
incomparable
in
enjoyment
it
is
even
more
delightful
than
a
gallop
on
zephyr
she
told
her
sister
who
stood
on
the
bank
with
a
cluster
of
gay
company
watching
the
skaters
i
doubt
not
that
since
there
is
even
more
danger
of
getting
your
neck
broken
upon
runaway
skates
than
on
a
runaway
horse
answered
hyacinth
after
an
hour
on
the
lake
in
which
denzil
had
distinguished
himself
by
his
mastery
of
the
new
exercise
being
always
at
hand
to
support
his
mistress
at
the
slightest
indication
of
peril
she
consented
to
the
removal
of
her
skates
at
papillon
earnest
entreaty
who
wanted
her
aunt
to
walk
with
her
before
dinner
after
dinner
there
would
be
the
december
twilight
and
christmas
games
and
the
like
which
papillon
although
a
little
fine
lady
reproducing
all
her
mother
likes
and
dislikes
in
miniature
could
not
as
a
human
child
altogether
disregard
i
do
care
about
such
nonsense
as
georgie
does
she
told
her
aunt
with
condescending
reference
to
her
brother
but
i
like
to
see
the
others
amused
those
village
children
are
such
funny
little
savages
they
stick
their
fingers
in
their
mouths
and
grin
at
me
and
call
me
annar
or
worship
and
say
to
everything
they
are
like
audrey
in
the
play
you
read
to
me
denzil
was
in
attendance
upon
aunt
and
niece
if
you
want
to
come
with
us
you
must
invent
a
pretty
walk
sir
denzil
said
papillon
i
am
tired
of
long
lanes
and
ploughed
fields
i
know
of
one
of
the
pleasantest
rambles
in
the
shire
across
the
woods
to
the
grange
and
we
can
rest
there
for
half
an
hour
if
angela
will
allow
us
and
take
a
light
refreshment
dear
sir
denzil
that
is
the
very
thing
answered
papillon
breathlessly
i
am
dying
of
hunger
and
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
the
abbey
will
there
be
any
cakes
or
mince
pies
at
the
grange
cakes
in
plenty
but
i
fear
there
will
be
no
mince
pies
my
mother
does
not
love
christmas
dainties
henriette
wanted
to
know
why
she
was
always
wanting
the
reason
of
things
a
bright
inquiring
little
mind
perpetually
on
the
alert
for
novelty
an
imitative
brain
like
a
monkey
hands
and
feet
that
know
not
rest
and
there
you
have
the
honourable
henrietta
maria
revel
papillon
they
crossed
the
river
angela
and
denzil
each
taking
an
oar
while
papillon
pretended
to
steer
a
process
which
she
effected
chiefly
by
screaming
another
lump
of
ice
she
shrieked
we
shall
be
swamped
i
believe
the
river
will
be
frozen
before
twelfth
night
and
we
shall
be
able
to
dance
upon
it
we
must
have
bonfires
and
roast
an
ox
for
the
poor
people
hubbuck
told
me
they
roasted
an
ox
the
year
king
charles
was
beheaded
horrid
brutes
to
think
that
they
could
eat
at
such
a
time
if
they
had
been
sorry
they
could
not
have
relished
roast
beef
hadley
grange
commonly
known
as
the
grange
was
in
every
detail
the
antithesis
of
chilton
abbey
at
the
abbey
the
eye
was
dazzled
the
mind
was
bewildered
by
an
excess
of
splendour
an
of
everything
gorgeous
or
beautiful
at
the
grange
sight
and
mind
were
rested
by
the
low
tone
of
colour
the
precision
of
form
all
the
furniture
in
the
house
was
elizabethan
plain
ponderous
the
conscientious
work
of
oxfordshire
mechanics
on
one
side
of
the
house
there
was
a
bowling
green
on
the
other
a
physic
garden
where
odours
of
medicinal
herbs
camomile
fennel
rosemary
rue
hung
ever
on
the
surrounding
air
there
was
nothing
modern
in
lady
warner
house
but
the
spotless
cleanliness
the
perfume
of
last
summer
roses
and
lavender
the
polished
surface
of
tables
and
cabinets
oak
chests
and
oak
floors
testifying
to
the
inexorable
industry
of
rustic
housemaids
in
all
other
respects
the
grange
was
like
a
house
that
had
just
awakened
from
a
century
of
sleep
lady
warner
rose
from
her
chair
by
the
chimney
corner
in
the
oak
parlour
and
laid
aside
the
book
she
had
been
reading
to
welcome
her
son
startled
at
seeing
him
followed
by
a
tall
fair
girl
in
a
black
mantle
and
hood
and
a
little
slip
of
a
thing
with
bright
dark
eyes
and
small
determined
face
pert
pointed
interrogative
framed
in
swansdown
a
small
a√´rial
figure
in
a
white
cloth
cloak
and
a
scarlet
brocade
frock
under
which
two
little
red
shoes
danced
into
the
room
mother
i
have
brought
angela
kirkland
and
her
niece
to
visit
you
this
christmas
morning
kirkland
and
her
niece
are
welcome
and
lady
warner
made
a
deep
curtsy
not
like
one
of
lady
fareham
sinking
curtseys
as
of
one
near
swooning
in
an
ecstasy
of
politeness
but
dignified
and
inflexible
straight
down
and
straight
up
again
but
as
for
christmas
is
one
of
those
superstitious
observances
which
i
have
ever
associated
with
a
church
i
abhor
denzil
reddened
furiously
to
have
brought
this
upon
his
beloved
angela
drew
herself
up
and
paled
at
the
unexpected
assault
the
brutality
of
it
was
startling
though
she
knew
from
denzil
opinions
that
his
mother
must
be
an
enemy
of
her
faith
indeed
madam
i
am
sorry
that
anybody
in
england
should
think
it
an
ill
thing
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
our
redeemer
and
lord
she
said
do
you
think
young
lady
that
foolish
romping
games
and
huge
chines
of
beef
and
smoking
ale
made
luscious
with
spices
and
roasted
pippins
and
and
can
be
the
proper
honouring
of
him
who
was
god
first
and
for
ever
and
man
only
for
one
brief
interval
in
his
eternal
existence
to
keep
god
birthday
with
drunken
rioting
what
blasphemy
if
you
can
think
that
there
is
not
more
profaneness
than
piety
in
such
sensual
revelries
why
it
is
that
you
do
not
know
how
to
think
you
would
have
learnt
to
reason
better
had
you
known
that
sweet
poet
and
musician
and
true
thinker
john
milton
with
whom
it
was
my
privilege
to
converse
frequently
during
my
husband
lifetime
and
afterwards
when
he
condescended
to
accept
my
son
for
his
pupil
and
spent
three
days
and
nights
under
this
roof
milton
is
still
at
chalfont
mother
so
you
may
hope
to
see
him
again
with
a
less
journey
than
to
london
said
denzil
seizing
the
first
chance
of
a
change
in
the
conversation
and
here
is
a
little
miss
to
whom
i
have
promised
a
light
collation
with
some
of
your
jersey
milk
mistress
kirkland
and
her
niece
shall
have
the
best
i
can
provide
the
larder
will
furnish
something
acceptable
i
doubt
not
although
i
and
my
household
observe
this
day
as
a
fast
what
madam
are
you
sorry
that
jesus
christ
was
born
asked
papillon
i
am
sorry
for
my
sins
little
mistress
and
for
the
sins
of
all
mankind
which
nothing
but
his
blood
could
wash
away
to
remember
his
birth
is
to
remember
that
he
died
for
us
and
that
is
why
i
spend
the
of
december
in
fasting
and
prayer
are
you
not
glad
you
are
to
dine
at
the
abbey
sir
denzil
asked
papillon
by
way
of
commentary
nay
i
put
no
restraint
on
my
son
he
can
serve
god
after
his
own
manner
and
veer
with
every
wind
of
passion
or
fancy
if
he
will
but
you
shall
have
your
cake
and
draught
of
milk
little
lady
and
you
too
mistress
kirkland
will
i
hope
taste
our
jersey
milk
unless
you
would
prefer
a
glass
of
malmsey
wine
kirkland
is
as
much
an
anchorite
as
yourself
mother
she
takes
no
wine
lady
warner
was
the
soul
of
hospitality
and
particularly
proud
of
her
dairy
when
kept
clear
of
theology
and
politics
she
was
not
an
woman
but
to
be
a
puritan
in
the
year
of
the
five
mile
act
was
not
to
think
kindly
of
the
government
under
which
she
lived
while
her
sense
of
her
own
wrongs
was
intensified
by
rumours
of
shown
to
papists
and
the
broad
assertion
that
king
and
duke
were
roman
catholic
at
heart
and
waited
only
the
convenient
hour
to
reforge
the
fetters
that
had
bound
england
to
rome
she
was
fond
of
children
most
of
all
of
little
girls
never
having
had
a
daughter
she
bent
down
to
kiss
henriette
and
then
turned
to
angela
with
her
kindest
smile
and
this
is
lady
fareham
daughter
she
is
as
pretty
as
a
picture
and
i
am
as
good
as
a
picture
sometimes
madam
chirped
papillon
mother
says
i
am
comme
un
when
thou
hast
been
silent
or
still
for
five
minutes
said
angela
and
that
is
but
seldom
a
loud
summoned
the
butler
and
an
arcadian
meal
was
speedily
set
out
on
a
table
in
the
hall
where
a
great
fire
of
logs
burnt
as
merrily
as
if
it
had
been
designed
to
enliven
a
household
indeed
there
was
nothing
miserly
or
sparing
about
the
housekeeping
at
the
grange
which
harmonised
with
the
sombre
richness
of
lady
warner
grey
brocade
gown
from
the
silk
mercer
at
the
sign
of
the
in
cheapside
there
was
liberality
without
waste
and
a
certain
quiet
refinement
in
every
detail
which
reminded
angela
of
the
convent
parlour
and
her
aunt
room
and
contrasted
curiously
with
the
elegant
disorder
of
her
sister
surroundings
papillon
clapped
her
hands
at
sight
of
the
large
plum
cake
the
jug
of
milk
and
bowl
of
blackberry
conserve
i
was
so
hungry
she
said
apologetically
after
denzil
had
supplied
her
with
generous
slices
of
cake
and
large
spoonfuls
of
jam
i
did
not
know
that
nonconformists
had
such
nice
things
to
eat
did
you
think
we
all
lay
in
gaol
to
suffer
cold
and
hunger
for
the
faith
that
is
in
us
like
that
poor
preacher
at
bedford
asked
lady
warner
bitterly
it
will
come
to
that
some
day
perhaps
under
the
new
act
will
you
show
mistress
kirkland
your
house
mother
and
your
dairy
denzil
asked
hurriedly
i
know
she
would
like
to
see
one
of
the
neatest
dairies
in
oxfordshire
no
request
could
be
more
acceptable
to
lady
warner
who
was
a
housekeeper
first
and
a
controversialist
afterwards
inclined
as
she
was
to
rail
against
the
church
of
rome
partly
because
she
had
made
up
her
mind
upon
hearsay
chiefly
miltonian
that
roman
catholicism
was
only
another
name
for
and
and
partly
on
account
of
the
favour
that
had
been
shown
to
papists
as
compared
with
the
cruel
treatment
of
nonconformists
still
there
was
a
charm
in
angela
gentle
beauty
against
which
the
daughterless
matron
could
not
steel
her
heart
she
melted
in
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
denzil
was
encouraging
henriette
to
herself
and
trying
to
persuade
angela
to
taste
this
or
that
dainty
or
reproaching
her
for
taking
so
little
and
by
the
time
the
child
had
finished
her
copious
meal
lady
warner
was
telling
herself
how
dearly
she
might
have
loved
this
girl
for
a
were
it
not
for
that
fatal
objection
of
a
corrupt
and
pernicious
creed
no
lovely
as
she
was
modest
refined
and
in
all
things
worthy
to
be
loved
the
question
of
creed
must
be
a
and
then
there
were
other
objections
rural
gossip
the
loose
talk
of
servants
had
brought
a
highly
coloured
description
of
lady
fareham
household
to
her
ears
the
extravagant
splendour
the
waste
and
idleness
the
late
hours
the
worship
of
pleasure
the
visiting
the
singing
and
dancing
and
junketing
and
worst
of
all
the
friendship
shown
to
a
parisian
fopling
had
formed
the
subject
of
conversation
in
many
an
assembly
of
pious
ladies
and
hands
and
eyebrows
had
been
uplifted
at
the
iniquities
of
chilton
abbey
as
second
only
to
the
monstrous
of
the
court
at
oxford
almost
ever
since
the
restoration
lady
warner
had
been
living
in
meek
expectancy
of
fire
from
heaven
and
the
chastisement
of
this
memorable
year
had
seemed
to
her
the
inevitable
realisation
of
her
fears
the
fiery
rain
had
come
down
impalpable
invisible
leaving
its
deadly
tokens
in
burning
plague
spots
the
forerunners
of
death
that
the
contagion
had
mostly
visited
that
humbler
class
of
persons
who
had
been
strangers
to
the
excesses
and
pleasures
of
the
court
made
nothing
against
lady
conviction
that
this
scourge
was
heaven
vengeance
upon
fashionable
vice
her
son
had
brought
her
stories
of
the
life
at
whitehall
terrible
pictures
of
iniquity
conveyed
in
the
scathing
words
of
one
who
sat
apart
in
a
humble
lodging
where
for
him
the
light
of
day
came
not
and
heard
with
disgust
and
horror
of
that
wave
of
debauchery
which
had
swept
over
the
city
he
loved
since
the
triumph
of
the
royalists
and
lady
warner
had
heard
the
words
of
milton
and
had
listened
with
a
reverence
as
profound
as
if
the
blind
poet
had
been
the
prophet
of
israel
alone
in
his
place
of
hiding
holding
himself
aloof
from
an
idolatrous
monarch
and
a
wicked
people
and
now
her
son
had
brought
her
this
fair
girl
upon
whom
he
had
set
his
foolish
hopes
a
papist
and
the
sister
of
a
woman
whose
ways
were
the
ways
of
a
favourite
scriptural
substantive
closed
the
sentence
in
lady
warner
mind
no
it
might
not
be
whatever
power
she
had
over
her
son
must
be
used
against
his
papistical
syren
she
would
treat
her
with
courtesy
show
her
house
and
dairy
and
there
an
end
and
so
they
repaired
to
the
offices
with
papillon
running
backwards
and
forwards
as
they
went
along
exclaiming
and
questioning
delighted
with
the
shining
oak
floors
and
great
oak
chests
in
the
corridor
and
the
armour
in
the
hall
where
as
the
sacred
and
central
object
hung
the
breastplate
sir
george
warner
wore
when
he
fell
at
hopton
heath
dinted
by
sword
and
pike
as
the
enemy
horse
rode
him
down
in
the
his
orange
scarf
soiled
and
torn
was
looped
across
the
steel
cuirass
papillon
admired
everything
most
of
all
the
great
cool
dairy
which
had
once
been
a
chapel
and
where
the
piscina
was
converted
to
a
niche
for
a
polished
brass
to
the
horror
of
angela
who
could
say
no
word
in
praise
of
a
place
that
had
been
created
by
the
profanation
of
holy
things
a
chapel
turned
into
a
storehouse
for
milk
and
butter
was
this
how
protestants
valued
consecrated
places
an
silence
came
upon
her
and
she
was
glad
when
denzil
remembered
that
they
would
have
barely
time
to
walk
back
to
the
abbey
before
the
two
dinner
you
keep
court
hours
even
in
the
country
said
lady
warner
i
dined
half
an
hour
before
you
came
i
do
care
if
i
have
no
dinner
said
papillon
but
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
eat
a
mince
pie
why
do
you
love
mince
pies
madam

chapter
x
the
priest
hole
denzil
dined
at
the
abbey
where
he
was
always
made
welcome
lady
fareham
had
been
warmly
insistent
upon
his
presence
at
their
christmas
gaieties
we
want
to
show
you
a
cavalier
christmas
she
told
him
at
dinner
he
seated
at
her
side
in
the
place
of
honour
while
angela
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
between
fareham
and
de
malfort
for
ourselves
we
care
little
for
such
simple
sports
but
for
the
poor
folk
and
the
children
yule
should
be
a
season
to
be
remembered
for
good
cheer
and
merriment
through
all
their
slow
dull
year
poor
wretches
i
think
of
their
hard
life
sometimes
and
wonder
they
do
either
drown
themselves
or
massacre
us
they
are
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
lady
fareham
they
have
learnt
patience
from
the
habit
of
suffering
they
are
born
poor
and
they
die
poor
it
is
happy
for
us
that
they
are
not
learned
enough
to
consider
the
inequalities
of
fortune
or
we
should
have
the
rising
of
want
against
abundance
a
bitterer
strife
perhaps
than
the
strife
of
adverse
creeds
which
made
ireland
so
bloody
a
spectacle
for
the
world
wonder
thirty
years
ago
well
we
shall
make
them
all
happy
this
afternoon
and
there
will
be
a
supper
in
the
great
stone
barn
which
will
acquaint
them
with
abundance
for
this
one
evening
at
least
answered
hyacinth
gaily
we
are
going
to
play
games
after
dinner
cried
henriette
from
her
place
at
her
father
elbow
his
lordship
was
the
only
person
who
ever
reproved
her
seriously
yet
she
loved
him
best
of
all
her
kindred
or
friends
aunt
angy
is
going
to
play
with
us
will
you
play
sir
denzil
i
shall
think
myself
privileged
if
i
may
join
in
your
amusements
what
a
courteous
speech
you
will
be
cutting
off
your
pretty
curly
hair
and
putting
on
a
french
perruque
like
his
pointing
to
de
malfort
please
do
not
you
would
be
like
everybody
else
in
london
and
now
you
are
only
like
yourself
and
vastly
handsome
hush
henriette
you
are
much
too
pert
remonstrated
fareham
but
is
the
very
truth
father
all
the
women
who
visit
mother
paint
their
faces
so
that
they
are
all
alike
and
all
the
men
talk
alike
so
that
i
do
know
one
from
except
lord
rochester
who
is
impudenter
and
younger
than
the
others
and
gives
me
more
and
pays
me
prettier
compliments
than
anybody
else
hold
your
tongue
mistress
a
is
no
place
for
pert
children
thy
brother
there
has
better
manners
said
her
father
pointing
to
the
cherubic
son
and
heir
whose
ideas
were
concentrated
upon
a
loaded
plate
of
pasty
you
mean
that
he
is
greedier
than
i
retorted
papillon
he
will
eat
till
he
wo
be
able
to
run
about
with
us
after
dinner
and
then
he
will
sprawl
upon
mother
satin
train
by
the
fire
with
ganymede
and
phosphor
and
she
will
tell
everybody
how
good
and
gentle
he
is
and
how
much
better
bred
than
his
sister
and
now
if
people
are
going
to
leave
off
eating
we
may
as
well
begin
our
games
before
it
is
quite
dark
perhaps
are
ready
auntie
if
nobody
else
is
dinner
may
have
ended
a
little
quicker
for
this
speech
although
papillon
was
sternly
suppressed
and
bade
to
keep
silence
or
leave
the
table
she
obeyed
so
far
as
to
make
no
further
remarks
but
expressed
her
contempt
for
the
gluttony
of
her
elders
by
several
loud
yawns
and
bounced
up
out
of
her
seat
like
a
ball
from
a
racket
directly
the
little
gentleman
in
black
sitting
near
his
lordship
had
murmured
a
discreet
thanksgiving
this
gentleman
was
the
roman
catholic
priest
from
oxford
who
had
said
mass
early
that
morning
in
the
muniment
room
and
had
been
invited
to
his
lordship
table
in
honour
of
the
festival
papillon
led
all
the
games
and
ordered
everybody
about
dorothy
lettsome
the
young
lady
who
was
sorry
she
had
not
had
the
honour
to
be
born
in
france
was
of
the
party
with
her
brother
honest
dan
lettsome
an
oxfordshire
squire
who
had
been
in
london
only
once
in
his
life
to
see
the
coronation
and
had
nearly
lost
his
life
as
well
as
his
purse
and
jewellery
in
a
tavern
after
that
august
ceremonial
this
bitter
experience
had
given
him
a
distaste
for
the
pleasures
of
the
town
which
his
poor
sister
deplored
exceedingly
since
she
was
dependent
upon
his
coffers
and
subject
to
his
authority
and
had
no
hope
of
leaving
oxfordshire
unless
she
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
husband

to
be
moving
about
rather
than
to
sit
still
and
listen
to
music
which
he
hated
or
to
conversation
to
which
he
could
contribute
neither
wit
nor
sense
unless
the
kennel
or
the
were
the
topic
under
discussion
the
talk
of
a
lady
and
gentleman
who
had
graduated
in
the
salons
of
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
was
a
foreign
language
to
him
and
he
told
his
sister
that
it
was
all
one
to
him
whether
lady
fareham
and
the
mounseer
talked
french
or
english
since
it
was
quite
as
hard
to
understand
in
one
language
as
in

rustic
youth
adored

knew
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
break
and
train
a
pony
for
her
to
teach
her
the
true
knack
of
clearing
a
hedge
to
explain
the
habits
and
nature
of
those
vermin
in
whose
lawless
lives
she
was

you
will
marry
me
sweetheart
when
you
are
of
the

age
i
would
rather
wait
half
a
dozen
years
for
you
than
have
the
best
woman
in

that
i

why
i
shall
marry
no

i
hope
it
will
be
a
duke
or
a
marquis
marchioness
is
a
pretty
title
it
sounds
better
than
duchess
because
it
is
in
three
syllables
with
an
affected
drawl
i
am
going
to
be
very
beautiful

so

i
heard

almost
as
great
a
beauty
as

i

i
shall
be
handsomer

concluded
papillon
in
a
tone
which
implied
a
poor
opinion
of
the
maternal
charms
and
now
on
this
christmas
evening
in
the
thickening
twilight
of
the
rambling
old
house
through
long
galleries
crooked
passages
queer
little
turns
at
right
angles
rooms
opening
out
of
rooms
half
a
dozen
in
succession
squire
dan
led
the
games
ordered
about
all
the
time
by
papillon
whom
he
talked
of
admiringly
as
a
filly
declaring
that
she
had
more
tricks
than
the
he
was
training
for
abingdon
races
de
malfort
after
assisting
in
their
sports
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
considerable
spirit
had
deserted
them
and
sneaked
off
to
the
great
saloon
where
he
sat
on
the
turkey
carpet
at
lady
fareham
feet
singing
chansonettes
to
his
guitar
while
george
and
the
spaniels
sprawled
beside
him
the
whole
group
making
a
picture
of
indolent
enjoyment
fitfully
lighted
by
the
blaze
of
a
yule
log
that
filled
the
width
of
the
chimney
fareham
and
the
priest
were
playing
chess
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
low
room
by
the
light
of
a
single
candle
papillon
ran
in
at
the
door
and
ejaculated
her
disgust
at
de
desertion
was
there
ever
such
laziness
it
bad
enough
in
georgie
to
be
so
idle
but
then
has
himself
and
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
myself
mistress
asked
de
malfort
you
never
do
that
but
you
often
drink
too
much
much
much
much
too
much
that
a
slanderous
thing
to
say
of
your
mother
most
devoted
servant
laughed
de
malfort
and
pray
how
does
a
like
you
know
when
a
gentleman
has
been
more
thirsty
than
discreet
by
the
way
you
talk
always
french

you
clip

sweetheart
said
her
father
who
heard
only
this
last
sentence
as
his
daughter
ran
past
him
towards
the
door
when
i
was
in
italy
i
was
told
of
a
bride
who
hid
herself
in
an
old
on
her
and
the
lid
clapped
to
with
a
spring
and
kept
her
there
for
half
a
century
there
no

that
ever

wrought
that

cried
de
malfort
sounding
a
light
accompaniment
to
his
words
on
the
guitar
strings
with
delicatest
touch
like
fairy
music
i
know
of
better
answered
the
child
and
vanished
banging
the
great
door
behind
her
she
found
her
aunt
with
dorothy
lettsome
and
her
brother
and
denzil
in
the
gallery
above
stairs
walking
up
and
down
and
listening
with
every
indication
of
weariness
to
the
squire
discourse
about
his
hunters
and
now
we
are
going
to
have
real
good
sport
cried
papillon
aunt
angy
and
i
are
to
hide
and
you
three
are
to
look
for
us
you
must
stop
in
this
gallery
for
ten
minutes
by
the
french
clock
yonder
with
the
door
shut
you
must
give
us
ten
minutes
law
lettsome
as
you
did
the
hare
the
other
day
when
i
was
out
with
you
and
then
you
may
begin
to
look
for
us
promise
stay
little
miss
you
will
be
outside
the
house
belike
roaming
lord
knows
where
in
the
shrubberies
or
the
barns
or
halfway
to
oxford
while
we
are
made
fools
of
here
no
no
we
will
be
inside
the
house
do
you
promise
that
pretty
lady
yes
i
promise
dorothy
suggested
that
there
had
been
enough
of
childish
play
and
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
sit
in
the
saloon
with
her
ladyship
and
hear
monsieur
de
malfort
sing
i
wager
he
was
singing
when
you
saw
him
just
now
yes
he
is
always
singing
foolish
french
songs
and
i
sure
you
understand
i
learnt
the
french
ever
since
i
was
as
old
as
you
mistress
henriette
ah
that
was
too
late
to
begin
people
who
learn
french
out
of
books
know
what
it
looks
like
but
not
what
it
sounds
like
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
i
could
not
understand
a
french
ballad
little
miss
would
you
would
you
really
cried
papillon
her
face
alight
with
impish
mirth
then
of
course
you
understand
this
oh
la
comme
elle
est
eh
je
me
moque
de
sa
eh
la
comme
elle
est
eh
je
de
sa
she
sang
this
impromptu
nonsense
as
she
danced
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
accomplished
dorothy
vexed
and
perplexed
at
not
having
understood
a
single
word
it
was
nearly
an
hour
later
when
denzil
entered
the
saloon
hurriedly
pale
and
perturbed
of
aspect
with
dorothy
and
her
brother
following
him
we
have
been
hunting
all
over
the
house
for
angela
and
henriette
denzil
said
and
fareham
started
up
from
the
scared
at
the
young
man
agitated
tone
and
pallid
countenance
we
have
looked
in
every
room
in
every
closet
interrupted
dorothy
in
every
corner
of
the
staircases
and
passages
said
squire
dan
can
your
lordship
help
us
there
may
be
places
you
know
of
which
we
do
not
know
said
denzil
his
voice
trembling
a
little
it
is
alarming
that
they
should
be
so
long
in
concealment
we
have
called
to
them
in
every
part
of
the
house
fareham
hurried
to
the
door
taking
instant
alarm
anxious
pale
alert
come
he
said
to
the
others
the
oak
chests
in
the
the
great
florentine
coffer
in
the
gallery
have
you
looked
in
those
yes
we
have
opened
every
chest
faith
to
see
sir
denzil
turn
over
piles
of
tapestries
you
would
have
thought
he
was
looking
for
a
fairy
that
could
hide
in
the
folds
of
a
curtain
said
lettsome
it
is
no
theme
for
jesting
i
hate
these
tricks
of
hiding
in
strange
corners
said
fareham
now
show
me
where
they
left
you
in
the
long
gallery
they
have
gone
up
to
the
roof
perhaps
we
have
been
in
the
roof
said
denzil
i
have
scarcely
recovered
my
senses
after
the
cracked
skull
i
got
from
one
of
your
added
lettsome
and
fareham
saw
that
both
men
had
their
doublets
coated
with
dust
and
cobwebs
in
a
manner
which
indicated
a
remorseless
searching
of
places
unvisited
by
housemaids
and
brooms
dorothy
with
a
due
regard
for
her
dainty
lace
kerchief
and
ruffles
and
her
cherry
silk
petticoat
had
avoided
these
loathly
places
the
abode
of
darkness
haunted
by
the
fear
of
rats
fareham
tramped
the
house
from
cellar
to
garret
denzil
alone
accompanying
him
we
want
no
posse
comitatus
he
had
said
somewhat
discourteously
you
squire
had
best
go
and
mend
your
cracked
head
in
the
with
a
brimmer
or
two
of
clary
wine
and
you
dorothy
can
go
and
keep
her
ladyship
company
but
not
a
word
of
our
fright
swoons
and
screaming
would
only
hinder
us
he
took
lettsome
arm
and
led
her
to
the
staircase
pushing
the
squire
after
her
and
then
turned
his
anxious
countenance
to
denzil
if
they
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
they
must
be
found
outside
the
house
oh
the
folly
the
madness
of
it
a
december
night
snow
on
the
ground
a
rising
wind
another
fall
of
snow
perhaps
and
those
two
afoot
and
alone
i
do
not
believe
they
are
denzil
answered
your
daughter
promised
that
they
would
not
leave
the
house
my
daughter
tells
the
truth
it
is
her
chief
virtue
and
yet
we
have
hunted
in
every
hole
and
corner
said
denzil
dejectedly
hole
cried
fareham
almost
in
a
shout
thou
hast
hit
it
man
that
one
word
is
a
flash
of
lightning
the
priest
hole
come
this
way
bring
your
candle
snatching
up
that
which
he
had
himself
set
down
on
a
table
when
he
stood
still
to
deliberate
the
priest
hole
the
child
knew
the
secret
of
it
fool
that
i
was
ever
to
show
her
god
what
a
place
to
hide
in
on
a
winter
night
he
was
halfway
up
the
staircase
to
the
second
story
before
he
had
uttered
the
last
of
these
exclamations
denzil
following
him
suddenly
through
the
stillness
of
the
house
there
sounded
a
faint
cry
the
shrill
thin
sound
of
a
child
voice
fareham
and
warner
would
hardly
have
heard
it
had
they
not
been
sportsmen
with
ears
trained
to
listen
for
distant
sounds
no
sounding
across
miles
of
wood
and
valley
was
ever
fainter
or
more
ethereal
you
hear
them
cried
fareham
quick
quick
he
led
the
way
along
a
narrow
gallery
about
eight
feet
high
where
people
had
danced
in
elizabeth
time
when
the
house
was
newly
converted
to
secular
uses
and
then
into
a
room
in
which
there
were
several
iron
chests
the
muniment
room
where
a
sliding
panel
of
which
the
master
of
the
house
knew
the
trick
revealed
an
opening
in
the
wall
fareham
squeezed
himself
through
the
gap
still
carrying
the
tall
iron
candlestick
with
flaring
candle
and
vanished
denzil
followed
and
found
himself
descending
a
narrow
stone
staircase
very
steep
built
into
an
angle
of
the
great
chimney
while
as
if
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
there
came
louder
at
every
step
that
shrill
cry
of
distress
in
a
voice
he
could
not
doubt
was
henriette
the
other
is
mute
groaned
fareham
scared
to
death
perhaps
like
a
frightened
bird
and
then
he
called
i
am
coming
you
are
safe
love
safe
safe
and
then
he
groaned
aloud
oh
the
madness
the
folly
of
it
halfway
down
the
staircase
there
was
a
sudden
gap
of
six
feet
down
which
fareham
dropped
with
his
hands
on
the
lowest
stair
denzil
following
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
the
descent
planned
for
the
discomfiture
of
strangers
and
the
protection
of
the
family
fareham
and
denzil
were
on
a
narrow
stone
landing
at
the
bottom
of
the
house
and
the
child
wail
of
anguish
changed
to
a
joyous
shriek
father
father
close
in
their
ears
fareham
set
his
shoulder
against
the
heavy
oak
door
and
it
burst
inwards
there
had
been
no
question
of
secret
spring
or
complicated
machinery
but
the
great
clumsy
door
dragged
upon
its
rusty
hinges
and
the
united
strength
of
the
two
girls
had
not
served
to
pull
it
open
though
papillon
in
her
eagerness
for
concealment
in
the
first
fever
of
hiding
had
been
strong
enough
to
push
the
door
till
she
had
jammed
it
and
thus
made
all
after
efforts
vain
father
she
cried
leaping
into
his
arms
as
he
came
into
the
room
large
enough
to
hold
standing
upright
but
a
hideous
den
in
which
to
perish
alone
in
the
dark
oh
father
i
thought
no
one
would
ever
find
us
i
was
afraid
we
should
have
died
like
the
italian
lady
and
people
would
have
found
our
skeletons
and
wondered
about
us
i
never
was
afraid
before
not
when
the
great
horse
reared
as
high
as
a
house
and
her
ladyship
screamed
i
only
laughed
then
but
i
have
been
afraid
fareham
put
her
aside
without
looking
at
her
angela
great
god
she
is
dead
no
she
was
not
dead
only
in
a
half
swoon
leaning
against
the
angle
of
the
wall
ghastly
white
in
the
flare
of
the
candles
she
was
not
quite
unconscious
she
knew
whose
strong
arms
were
holding
her
whose
lips
were
so
near
her
own
whose
head
bent
suddenly
upon
her
breast
leaning
against
the
lace
kerchief
to
listen
for
the
beating
of
her
heart
she
made
a
great
effort
to
relieve
his
fear
understanding
dimly
that
he
thought
her
dead
but
could
only
murmur
broken
syllables
till
he
carried
her
up
three
or
four
stairs
to
a
secret
door
that
opened
into
the
garden
there
in
the
wintry
air
under
the
steely
light
of
wintry
stars
her
senses
came
back
to
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
i
am
sorry
i
have
not
papillon
courage
she
said
tu
donn√©
une
affreuse
peur
je
te
croyais
morte
muttered
fareham
letting
his
arms
drop
like
lead
as
she
released
herself
from
their
support
denzil
and
henriette
were
close
to
them
they
had
come
to
the
open
door
for
fresh
air
after
the
chill
and
closeness
of
the
small
underground
chamber
father
is
angry
with
me
said
the
girl
he
wo
speak
to
me
angry
no
no
and
he
bent
to
kiss
her
but
oh
child
the
folly
of
it
she
might
have
died
you
too
found
just
an
hour
too
late
it
would
have
taken
a
long
time
to
kill
me
said
papillon
but
i
was
very
cold
and
my
teeth
were
chattering
and
i
should
soon
have
been
hungry
have
you
had
supper
yet
nobody
has
even
thought
of
supper
i
am
glad
of
that
and
i
may
have
supper
with
you
may
i
and
eat
what
i
like
because
it
christmas
and
because
i
might
have
been
starved
to
death
in
the
priest
hole
but
it
was
a
good
tout
de
meme
who
guessed
at
last
the
only
person
who
knew
of
the
place
child
and
now
remember
the
secret
is
to
be
kept
your
dungeon
may
some
day
save
an
honest
man
life
you
must
tell
nobody
where
you
were
hid
but
what
shall
i
say
when
they
ask
me
i
must
not
tell
them
a
story
say
you
were
hidden
in
the
great
chimney
which
is
truth
for
the
hole
is
but
a
recess
at
the
back
of
the
chimney
and
you
warner
turning
to
denzil
who
had
not
spoken
since
the
opening
of
the
door
i
know
keep
the
secret
yes
i
will
keep
your
secret
denzil
answered
cold
as
ice
and
said
no
word
more
they
walked
slowly
round
the
house
by
the
terrace
where
the
clipped
yews
stood
out
like
obelisks
against
the
bleak
bright
sky
papillon
ran
and
skipped
at
her
father
side
clinging
to
him
expatiating
upon
her
sufferings
in
the
dust
and
darkness
denzil
followed
with
angela
in
a
dead
silence
chapter
xi
lighter
than
vanity
i
think
father
must
be
a
witch
henriette
said
at
dinner
next
day
or
why
did
he
tell
me
of
the
italian
lady
who
was
shut
in
the
just
before
angela
and
i
were
lost
in
she
checked
herself
at
a
look
from
his
lordship
in
the
chimney
it
wants
no
witch
to
tell
that
little
girls
are
foolish
and
mischievous
answered
fareham
you
ladies
must
have
been
vastly
black
when
you
came
out
of
your
said
de
malfort
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
see
so
much
beauty
disguised
in
soot
perhaps
kirkland
means
to
appear
in
the
character
of
a
chimney
at
our
next
court
masquerade
she
would
cause
as
great
a
stir
as
lady
muskerry
in
all
her
babylonian
splendour
but
for
other
reasons
nothing
could
mitigate
the
muskerry
ugliness
and
no
disguise
could
hide
angela
beauty
what
would
the
costume
be
asked
papillon
oh
something
simple
a
long
black
satin
gown
and
a
velvet
hat
tall
and
curiously
twisted
like
your
tudor
chimney
and
a
cluster
of
grey
feathers
on
the
top
to
represent
smoke
monsieur
le
comte
makes
a
joke
of
everything
but
what
would
father
have
said
if
we
had
never
been
found
i
should
have
said
that
they
are
right
who
swear
there
is
a
curse
upon
all
property
taken
from
the
church
and
that
the
ban
fell
black
and
bitter
upon
chilton
abbey
answered
his
lordship
grave
deep
voice
from
the
end
of
the
table
where
he
sat
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
gloomy
and
silent
save
when
directly
addressed
her
ladyship
and
de
malfort
had
always
plenty
to
talk
about
they
had
the
past
as
well
as
the
present
for
their
discourse
and
were
always
sighing
for
the
vanished
glories
of
their
youth
at
paris
at
fontainebleau
at
germain
nor
were
they
restricted
to
the
realities
of
the
present
and
the
memories
of
the
past
they
had
that
wider
world
of
unreality
in
which
to
circulate
they
had
the
scud√®ry
language
at
the
tips
of
their
tongues
the
fantastic
sentimentalism
of
that
marvellous
old
maid
who
invented
the
hero
and
heroine
or
who
crystallised
the
vanishing
figures
of
that
brilliant
age
and
made
them
immortal
all
that
little
language
of
toyshop
platonics
had
become
a
natural
form
of
speech
with
these
two
bred
and
educated
in
the
marais
while
it
was
still
the
select
and
aristocratic
quarter
of
paris
hyacinth
and
her
old
playfellow
had
been
chattering
like
children
or
birds
in
an
aviary
and
with
little
more
sense
in
their
conversation
but
at
this
talk
of
the
church
ban
hyacinth
stopped
in
her
prattle
and
was
almost
serious
i
sometimes
think
we
shall
have
bad
luck
in
this
house
she
said
or
that
we
shall
see
the
ghosts
of
the
wicked
monks
who
were
turned
out
to
make
room
for
fareham
tush
child
what
do
you
know
of
their
wickedness
after
a
century
they
were
very
wicked
i
believe
for
it
was
one
of
those
quiet
little
monasteries
where
the
monks
could
do
all
manner
of
evil
things
and
raise
the
devil
if
they
liked
without
anybody
knowing
and
when
henry
the
eighth
sent
his
commissioners
they
were
taken
by
surprise
and
the
altar
at
which
they
worshipped
beelzebub
was
found
in
a
side
chapel
and
a
wax
figure
of
the
king
stuck
with
arrows
like
sebastian
the
abbot
pretended
it
sebastian
but
nobody
believed
him
nobody
wanted
to
believe
him
said
fareham
king
henry
made
an
example
of
chilton
abbey
and
gave
it
to
my
worthy
ancestor
who
was
a
fourth
cousin
of
jane
seymour
and
had
turned
protestant
to
please
his
royal
master
he
went
back
to
the
church
of
rome
on
his
and
we
revels
have
been
papists
ever
since
i
wish
the
church
joy
of
us
the
church
has
neither
profit
nor
honour
from
you
said
his
wife
shaking
her
fan
at
him
you
seldom
go
to
mass
you
never
go
to
confession
i
would
rather
keep
my
sins
to
myself
and
atone
for
them
by
the
pangs
of
a
wounded
conscience
that
is
too
easy
a
religion
which
shifts
the
burden
of
guilt
on
to
the
shoulders
of
a
stipendiary
priest
and
walks
away
from
the
confessional
absolved
by
the
payment
of
a
few
extra
prayers
i
believe
you
are
either
an
infidel
or
a
puritan
a
cross
between
the
two
perhaps
a
mongrel
in
religion
as
i
am
a
mongrel
in
politics
angela
looked
up
at
him
with
sad
eyes
reproachful
yet
full
of
pity
she
remembered
his
wild
talk
some
of
it
all
feverish
and
excited
during
his
illness
and
how
she
had
listened
with
aching
heart
to
the
ravings
of
one
so
near
death
and
so
unfit
to
die
and
now
that
the
pestilence
had
passed
him
by
now
that
he
was
a
strong
man
again
with
half
a
lifetime
before
him
her
heart
was
still
heavy
for
him
she
who
sat
in
the
theatre
of
life
as
a
spectator
had
discovered
that
her
sister
husband
was
not
happy
the
trifles
that
delighted
hyacinth
left
fareham
unamused
and
discontented
and
his
wife
knew
not
that
there
was
anything
wanting
to
his
felicity
she
could
go
on
prattling
like
a
child
could
be
in
a
fever
about
a
fan
or
a
bunch
of
ribbons
could
talk
for
an
hour
of
a
new
play
or
the
contents
of
the
french
while
he
sat
gloomy
and
apart
the
sympathy
the
companionship
that
should
be
in
marriage
was
wanting
here
angela
saw
and
deplored
this
distance
scarce
daring
to
touch
so
delicate
a
theme
fearful
lest
she
the
younger
should
seem
to
sermonise
the
elder
and
yet
she
could
not
be
silent
for
ever
while
duty
and
religion
urged
her
to
speak
at
chilton
abbey
the
sisters
were
rarely
alone
papillon
was
almost
always
with
them
and
de
malfort
spent
more
of
his
life
in
attendance
upon
lady
fareham
than
at
oxford
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
living
lettsome
and
her
brother
were
frequent
guests
and
of
fine
people
came
over
from
the
court
almost
every
day
indeed
it
was
only
character
austere
as
clarendon
or
southampton
which
kept
the
finest
of
all
company
at
a
distance
lady
castlemaine
had
called
at
chilton
in
her
early
in
july
and
her
visit
had
not
been
returned
a
slight
which
the
proud
beauty
bitterly
resented
and
from
that
time
she
had
lost
no
opportunity
of
depreciating
lady
fareham
happily
her
jests
not
over
refined
in
quality
had
not
been
repeated
to
hyacinth
husband
one
january
afternoon
the
opportunity
came
the
sisters
were
sitting
alone
in
front
of
the
vast
mediaeval
chimney
where
the
abbots
of
old
had
burnt
their
surplus
timber
angela
busy
with
her
embroidery
frame
working
a
satin
coverlet
for
her
niece
bed
hyacinth
yawning
over
a
volume
of
cyrus
in
whose
stately
pages
she
loved
to
recognise
the
portraits
of
her
dearest
friends
and
for
which
she
was
a
living
key
angela
was
now
familiar
with
the
famous
romance
which
she
had
read
with
deepest
interest
enlightened
by
her
sister
as
an
eastern
story
a
record
of
battles
and
sieges
evolved
from
a
clever
spinster
brain
an
account
of
men
and
women
who
had
never
lived
the
book
might
have
seemed
passing
dull
but
the
story
of
actual
lives
of
living
breathing
beauty
and
valour
that
still
burnt
in
warrior
breasts
the
keen
and
clever
analysis
of
men
and
women
who
were
making
history
could
not
fail
to
interest
an
intelligent
girl
to
whom
all
things
in
life
were
new
angela
read
of
the
siege
of
dunkirk
where
fareham
had
fought
of
the
tempestuous
weather
the
camp
in
the
midst
of
salt
marshes
and
quicksands
and
all
the
sufferings
and
perils
of
life
in
the
trenches
he
had
been
in
more
than
one
of
those
battles
which
mademoiselle
conscientious
pen
depicted
with
such
graphic
power
the
at
her
elbow
as
she
wrote
the
names
of
battles
sieges
generals
had
been
on
his
lips
in
his
delirious
ravings
he
had
talked
of
the
taking
of
charenton
the
key
to
paris
a
stronghold
dominating
seine
and
marne
of
clanleu
the
brave
defender
of
the
fortress
of
ch√¢tillon
who
led
the
charge
both
killed
there
ch√¢tillon
the
friend
of
cond√©
who
wept
bitterest
tears
for
a
loss
that
poisoned
victory
read
by
these
lights
the
grand
cyrus
was
a
book
to
be
pored
over
a
book
to
bend
over
in
the
grey
winter
dusk
reading
by
the
broad
blaze
of
the
logs
that
flamed
and
crackled
on
standards
just
as
merrily
the
blaze
had
spread
its
ruddy
light
over
the
room
when
it
was
a
monkish
refectory
and
when
the
droning
of
a
youthful
brother
reading
aloud
to
the
fraternity
as
they
ate
their
supper
was
the
only
sound
except
the
clattering
of
knives
and
grinding
of
jaws
now
the
room
was
her
ladyship
bright
with
gobelins
tapestry
dazzling
with
venetian
mirrors
gaudy
with
gold
and
colour
the
black
oak
floor
enlivened
by
carpets
from
our
new
colony
of
tangiers
fareham
told
his
wife
that
her
moorish
carpets
had
cost
the
country
fifty
times
the
price
she
had
paid
for
them
and
were
associated
with
an
irrevocable
evil
in
the
existence
of
a
childless
queen
but
that
piece
of
malice
hyacinth
told
him
had
no
foundation
but
his
hatred
of
the
duke
who
had
always
been
perfectly
civil
to
him
of
two
profligate
brothers
i
prefer
the
bolder
sinner
said
fareham
bigotry
and
debauchery
are
an
ill
mixture
i
doubt
if
his
majesty
frets
for
the
want
of
an
heir
remarked
de
malfort
he
is
not
a
family
man
he
is
not
a
one
family
man
count
answered
fareham
fareham
and
de
malfort
were
both
away
on
this
january
evening
papillon
was
taking
a
dancing
lesson
from
a
wizened
old
frenchman
who
brought
himself
and
his
fiddle
from
oxford
twice
a
week
for
the
damsel
instruction
priscilla
nurse
and
attended
these
lessons
at
which
the
honourable
henrietta
maria
revel
gave
herself
prodigious
airs
and
was
indeed
so
rude
to
the
poor
old
professor
that
her
aunt
had
declined
to
assist
at
any
more
performances
has
his
lordship
gone
to
oxford
angela
asked
after
a
silence
broken
only
by
her
sister
yawns
i
doubt
he
is
anywhere
rather
than
in
such
good
company
hyacinth
answered
carelessly
he
hates
the
king
and
would
like
to
preach
at
him
as
john
knox
did
at
his
fareham
is
riding
or
roving
with
his
dogs
i
dare
say
he
has
a
gloomy
taste
for
solitude
hyacinth
do
you
not
see
that
he
is
unhappy
angela
asked
suddenly
and
the
pain
in
her
voice
startled
her
sister
from
the
contemplation
of
the
sublime
mandane
unhappy
child
what
reason
has
he
to
be
unhappy
ah
dearest
it
is
that
i
would
have
you
discover
is
a
wife
business
to
know
what
grieves
her
husband
unless
it
be
lewin
bill
who
is
an
inexorable
harpy
i
know
of
no
act
of
mine
that
can
afflict
him
i
did
not
mean
that
his
gloom
was
caused
by
any
act
of
yours
sister
i
only
urge
you
to
discover
why
he
is
so
sad
sad
sullen
you
mean
he
has
a
fine
generous
nature
i
am
sure
it
is
not
lewin
charges
that
trouble
him
but
he
had
always
a
sullen
temper
by
fits
and
starts
but
of
late
he
has
been
always
silent
and
gloomy
how
the
child
watches
him
ma
tr√®s
ch√®re
that
silence
is
natural
there
are
but
two
things
fareham
loves
the
first
war
the
second
sport
if
he
can
not
be
storming
a
town
he
loves
to
be
killing
a
fox
this
fireside
life
of
ours
our
books
and
music
our
idle
talk
of
plays
and
dances
wearies
him
you
may
see
how
he
avoids
us
except
dear
hyacinth
forgive
me
angela
began
falteringly
leaving
her
embroidery
frame
and
moving
to
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
where
she
dropped
on
her
knees
by
her
ladyship
chair
and
was
almost
swallowed
up
in
the
ample
folds
of
her
brocade
train
is
it
not
possible
that
lord
fareham
is
pained
to
see
you
so
much
gayer
and
more
familiar
with
monsieur
de
malfort
than
you
ever
are
with
him
gayer
more
familiar
cried
hyacinth
can
you
conceive
any
creature
gay
and
familiar
with
fareham
one
could
as
soon
be
gay
with
don
quixote
indeed
there
is
much
in
common
between
the
knight
of
the
rueful
countenance
and
my
husband
gay
and
familiar
and
pray
mistress
why
should
i
not
take
life
pleasantly
with
a
man
who
understands
me
and
in
whose
friendship
i
have
grown
up
almost
as
if
we
were
brother
and
sister
do
you
forget
that
i
have
known
henri
ever
since
i
was
ten
years
old
that
we
played
battledore
and
shuttlecock
together
in
our
dear
garden
in
the
rue
de
touraine
next
the
when
he
was
at
school
with
the
jesuit
fathers
and
used
to
spend
all
his
holiday
afternoons
with
the
marquise
i
think
i
only
learnt
to
know
the
saints
days
because
they
brought
me
my
playfellow
and
when
i
was
old
enough
to
attend
the
court
and
indeed
i
was
but
a
child
when
i
first
appeared
there
it
was
henri
who
sang
my
praises
and
brought
a
crowd
of
admirers
about
me
ah
what
a
life
it
was
love
in
the
city
and
war
at
the
gates
plots
battles
barricades
how
happy
we
all
were
except
when
there
came
the
news
of
some
great
man
killed
and
walls
were
hung
with
black
where
there
had
been
a
thousand
wax
candles
and
a
crowd
of
dancers
ch√¢tillon
chabot
laval
those
were
sad
losses
dear
sister
i
can
understand
your
affection
for
an
old
friend
but
i
would
not
have
you
place
him
above
your
husband
least
of
all
would
i
have
his
lordship
suspect
that
you
preferred
the
friend
to
the
husband
suspect
fareham
are
you
afraid
i
shall
make
fareham
jealous
because
i
sing
duets
and
cudgel
these
poor
brains
to
make
with
de
malfort
ah
child
how
little
those
watchful
eyes
of
yours
have
discovered
the
man
character
fareham
jealous
why
at
germain
he
has
seen
me
surrounded
by
adorers
the
subject
of
more
madrigals
than
would
fill
a
big
book
at
the
louvre
he
has
seen
me
the
what
is
that
your
friend
old
the
republican
poet
calls
it
cynosure
of
neighbouring
eyes
do
think
me
vain
ma
mie
i
am
an
old
woman
now
and
i
hate
my
ever
since
it
has
shown
me
my
first
wrinkle
but
in
those
days
i
had
almost
as
many
admirers
as
madame
henriette
or
the
princess
palatine
or
the
duchess
i
was
called
la
belle
anglaise
it
was
difficult
to
sound
a
in
ears
so
obstinately
deaf
to
all
serious
things
papillon
came
bounding
in
after
her
exuberant
loquacious
the
little
beast

taught
me
a
new
step
in
the
coranto
see
mother
and
the
slim
small
figure
was
drawn
up
to
its
fullest
and
the
thin
little
lithe
arms
were
curved
with
a
studied
grace
as
papillon
slid
and
tripped
across
the
room
her
dainty
little
features
illumined
by
a
smirk
of
ineffable
conceit
henriette
you
are
an
child
to
call
your
master
so
rude
a
name
remonstrated
her
mother
languidly
is
the
name
you
called
him
last
week
when
his
dirty
shoes
left
marks
on
the
stairs
he
changes
his
shoes
in
my
presence

disgustedly
i
saw

chapter
xii
lady
fareham
day
a
month
later
the
brought
lady
fareham
the
welcomest
news
that
she
had
read
for
ever
so
long
the
london
had
decreased
and
his
majesty
had
gone
to
hampton
court
attended
by
the
duke
and
prince
rupert
lord
clarendon
and
his
other
indispensable
advisers
and
a
retinue
of
servants
to
be
within
easy
distance
of
that
sturdy
soldier
albemarle
who
had
remained
in
london
unafraid
of
the
pestilence
and
who
declared
that
while
it
was
essential
for
him
to
be
in
frequent
communication
with
his
majesty
it
would
be
perilous
to
the
interests
of
the
state
for
him
to
absent
himself
from
london
for
the
dutch
war
had
gone
drivelling
on
ever
since
the
victory
in
june
and
that
victory
was
not
to
be
supposed
final
indeed
according
to
the
general
there
was
need
of
speedy
action
and
a
considerable
increase
of
our
naval
strength
windsor
had
been
thought
of
in
the
first
place
as
a
residence
for
the
king
but
the
law
courts
had
been
transferred
there
and
the
judges
and
their
following
had
overrun
the
town
while
there
was
a
report
of
an
infected
house
there
so
it
had
been
resolved
that
his
majesty
should
make
a
brief
residence
at
hampton
court
leaving
the
queen
the
duchess
and
their
belongings
at
oxford
whither
he
could
return
as
soon
as
the
business
of
providing
for
the
setting
out
of
the
fleet
had
been
arranged
between
him
and
the
general
who
could
travel
in
a
day
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
cockpit
and
wolsey
palace
when
this
news
came
they
were
snowed
up
at
chilton
sport
of
all
kinds
had
been
stopped
and
fareham
who
in
his
wife
parlance
lived
in
his
boots
all
the
winter
had
to
amuse
himself
without
the
aid
of
horse
and
hound
while
even
walking
was
made
difficult
by
the
snowdrifts
that
blocked
the
lanes
and
reduced
the
face
of
nature
to
one
muffled
and
monotonous
whiteness
while
all
the
edges
of
the
landscape
were
outlined
vaguely
against
the
misty
greyness
of
the
sky
hyacinth
spent
her
days
half
in
yawning
and
sighing
and
half
in
idle
laughter
and
childish
games
with
henriette
and
de
malfort
when
she
was
gay
she
was
as
much
a
child
as
her
daughter
when
she
was
fretful
and
hipped
it
was
a
childish
discontent
they
played
battledore
and
shuttlecock
in
the
and
my
lady
laughed
when
her
volant
struck
some
reverend
judge
or
venerable
bishop
a
rap
on
the
nose
they
sat
for
hours
twanging
guitars
hyacinth
taking
her
from
de
malfort
whose
exquisite
taste
and
touch
made
a
guitar
seem
a
different
instrument
from
that
on
which
his
pupil
delicate
fingers
nipped
a
wiry
melody
more
suggestive
of
than
music
he
taught
her
and
took
all
possible
pains
in
the
teaching
and
laughed
at
her
and
told
her
plainly
that
she
had
no
talent
for
music
he
told
her
that
in
her
hands
the
finest
lute
laux
maler
ever
made
mellowed
by
three
centuries
would
be
but
wood
and
catgut
it
is
the
prettiest
head
in
the
world
and
a
forehead
as
white
as
queen
anne
he
said
one
day
with
a
light
touch
on
the
ringletted
brow
but
there
is
nothing
inside
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
here
and
the
same
light
touch
fluttered
for
an
instant
against
her
brocade
bodice
at
the
spot
where
fancy
locates
the
faculty
of
loving
and
suffering
she
laughed
at
his
rude
speeches
just
as
she
laughed
at
his
flatteries
as
if
there
were
safety
in
that
atmosphere
of
idle
mirth
angela
heard
and
wondered
wondering
most
perhaps
what
occupied
and
interested
lord
fareham
in
those
white
winter
days
when
he
lived
for
the
greater
part
alone
in
his
own
rooms
or
pacing
the
long
walks
from
which
the
gardeners
had
cleared
the
snow
he
spent
some
of
his
time
indoors
deep
in
a
book
she
knew
as
much
as
that
he
had
allowed
angela
to
read
some
of
his
favourites
though
he
would
not
permit
any
of
the
new
comedies
which
everybody
at
court
was
reading
to
enter
his
house
much
to
lady
fareham
annoyance
i
am
half
a
century
behind
all
my
friends
in
intelligence
she
said
because
of
your
puritanism
one
tires
of
your
everlasting
gloomy
tragedies
your
and
i
am
all
for
the
genius
of
comedy
then
satisfy
your
inclinations
and
read
moli√®re
he
is
second
only
to
shakespeare
i
have
him
by
heart
already
the
and
delighted
angela
indeed
she
had
read
the
latter
play
so
often
and
with
such
deep
interest
that
many
passages
in
it
had
engraved
themselves
on
her
memory
and
recurred
to
her
sometimes
in
the
silence
of
wakeful
nights
that
character
of
bellario
touched
her
as
no
heroine
of
the
grand
cyrus
had
power
to
move
her
how
elaborately
artificial
seemed
the
polished
tirades
her
refinements
and
quintessences
of
the
grand
passion
as
compared
with
the
fervid
simplicity
of
the
a
love
so
humble
so
intense
so
unselfish
sir
denzil
came
to
chilton
nearly
every
day
and
was
always
graciously
received
by
her
ladyship
his
puritan
gravity
fell
away
from
him
like
a
pilgrim
cloak
in
the
light
air
of
hyacinth
amusements
he
seemed
to
grow
younger
and
henriette
sharp
eyes
discovered
an
improvement
in
his
dress
this
is
your
second
new
suit
since
christmas
she
said
and
i
swear
it
is
made
by
the
king
tailor
regardez
done
madame
what
exquisite
embroidery
silver
and
gold
thread
intermixed
with
little
sparks
of
garnets
sewn
in
the
pattern
it
is
better
than
anything
of
his
lordship
i
wish
i
had
a
father
who
dressed
well
i
sure
mine
must
be
the
shabbiest
lord
at
whitehall
you
have
no
right
to
be
more
modish
than
monsieur
mon
p√®re
sir
denzil
hold
that
insolent
tongue
dr√¥le
cried
the
mother
sir
denzil
is
younger
by
a
dozen
years
than
his
lordship
and
has
his
reputation
to
make
at
court
and
with
the
ladies
he
will
meet
there
i
hope
you
are
coming
to
london
denzil
you
shall
have
a
seat
in
one
of
our
coaches
as
soon
as
the
diminishes
and
this
odious
weather
breaks
up
your
ladyship
is
all
goodness
i
shall
go
where
my
leads
answered
denzil
looking
at
angela
and
blushing
at
the
audacity
of
his
speech
he
was
one
of
those
modest
lovers
who
rarely
bring
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
the
beloved
object
but
are
so
as
to
do
most
of
the
blushing
themselves
a
week
later
lady
fareham
could
do
nothing
but
praise
that
severe
weather
which
she
had
pronounced
odious
for
her
husband
coming
in
from
oxford
after
a
ride
along
the
road
deep
with
melting
snow
brought
the
news
of
a
considerable
diminution
in
the
london
and
the
more
startling
news
that
his
majesty
had
removed
to
whitehall
for
the
quicker
despatch
of
business
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
albeit
the
bills
of
mortality
recorded
fifteen
hundred
deaths
from
the
pestilence
in
the
previous
week
and
although
not
a
carriage
appeared
in
the
deserted
streets
of
the
metropolis
except
those
in
his
majesty
train
how
brave
how
admirable
cried
hyacinth
clapping
her
hands
in
the
exuberance
of
her
joy
then
we
can
go
to
london
if
horses
and
coaches
can
be
made
ready
give
your
orders
at
once
fareham
i
beseech
you
the
thaw
has
set
in
there
will
be
no
snow
to
stop
us
there
will
be
floods
which
may
make
fords
impassable
we
can
avoid
every
ford
there
is
always
a
by
the
lanes
have
you
any
idea
what
the
lanes
will
be
like
after
two
feet
deep
of
snow
be
sure
my
love
you
are
happier
twanging
your
lute
by
this
fireside
than
you
would
be
stuck
in
a
quagmire
perishing
with
cold
in
a
windy
coach
i
will
risk
the
quagmires
and
the
windy
coach
oh
my
lord
if
you
ever
loved
me
let
us
set
out
i
languish
for
fareham
house
my
my
friends
my
watermen
to
waft
me
to
and
fro
between
blackfriars
and
westminster
the
mercers
in
paul
churchyard
the
middle
exchange
i
have
not
bought
myself
anything
pretty
since
christmas
let
us
go
and
risk
spoiling
the
prettiest
thing
you
own
your
face
by
a
the
king
is
there
the
plague
is
ended
do
you
think
he
is
a
god
that
the
pestilence
will
flee
at
his
coming
i
think
his
courage
is
godlike
to
be
the
first
to
return
to
that
abandoned
city
what
of
monk
and
the
archbishop
who
never
left
it
a
rough
old
soldier
a
churchman
such
lives
were
meant
to
face
danger
but
his
majesty
a
man
for
whom
existence
should
be
one
long
holiday
he
has
done
his
best
to
make
it
so
but
the
pestilence
has
shown
him
that
there
are
grim
realities
in
life
do
fret
dearest
we
will
go
to
town
as
soon
as
it
is
prudent
to
make
the
move
kings
must
brave
great
hazards
and
there
is
no
reason
that
little
people
like
us
should
risk
our
lives
because
the
necessities
of
state
compel
his
majesty
to
imperil
his
we
shall
be
laughed
at
if
we
do
not
hasten
after
him
let
them
laugh
who
please
i
have
passed
through
the
ordeal
hyacinth
i
do
want
a
second
attack
of
the
sickness
nor
would
i
for
worlds
that
you
or
your
sister
should
run
into
the
mouth
of
danger
besides
you
can
lose
little
pleasure
by
being
absent
for
the
are
all
closed
and
the
court
is
in
mourning
for
the
french
poor
queen
anne
sighed
hyacinth
she
was
always
kind
to
me
and
to
die
of
a
cancer
after
those
she
most
loved
king
louis
would
scarcely
believe
she
was
seriously
ill
till
she
was
at
the
point
of
death
but
we
know
what
mourning
means
at
whitehall
lady
castlemaine
in
black
velvet
with
forty
thousand
pounds
in
diamonds
to
enliven
it
a
concert
instead
of
a
play
perhaps
and
the
king
sitting
in
a
corner
whispering
with
stewart
but
as
for
the
contagion
you
will
see
that
everybody
will
rush
back
to
london
and
that
you
and
i
will
be
the
next
week
justified
lady
fareham
assertion
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
king
had
established
himself
at
whitehall
the
great
people
came
back
to
their
london
houses
and
the
town
began
to
fill
it
was
as
if
a
god
had
smiled
upon
the
smitten
city
and
that
healing
and
happiness
radiated
from
the
golden
halo
round
that
anointed
head
was
not
this
the
monarch
of
whom
the
most
eloquent
preacher
of
the
age
had
written
in
the
arms
of
whose
justice
and
wisdom
we
lie
down
in
safety
london
flung
off
her
cerements
erased
her
the
dreadful
bell
no
longer
sounded
in
the
silence
of
an
afflicted
city
coffins
no
longer
stood
at
every
other
door
the
pits
at
finsbury
in
tothill
fields
at
islington
were
all
filled
up
and
trampled
down
and
the
grass
was
beginning
to
grow
over
the
forgotten
dead
the
judges
came
back
to
westminster
london
was
alive
again
alive
and
healed
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
royalty
nowhere
was
london
more
alive
in
the
month
of
march
than
at
fareham
house
on
the
thames
where
the
fareham
liveries
of
green
and
gold
showed
conspicuous
upon
his
lordship
watermen
lounging
about
the
stone
steps
that
led
down
to
the
water
or
waiting
in
the
terraced
garden
which
was
one
of
the
finest
on
the
river
wherries
of
various
weights
and
sizes
filled
one
spacious
boathouse
and
in
another
handsome
stone
edifice
with
a
vaulted
roof
lord
fareham
barge
lay
in
state
glorious
in
cream
colour
and
gold
with
green
velvet
cushions
and
oriental
carpets
as
splendid
as
that
barge
which
charles
had
sent
as
a
present
to
madame
a
vessel
to
cleopatra
galley
when
her
ladyship
and
her
friends
and
their
and
musicians
filled
it
for
a
voyage
to
hampton
court
the
barge
was
used
on
festive
occasions
or
for
country
voyages
as
to
hampton
or
greenwich
the
wherries
were
in
constant
requisition
along
that
shining
waterway
rank
and
fashion
commerce
and
business
were
moving
backwards
and
forwards
all
day
long
that
more
novel
mode
of
transit
the
hackney
coach
was
only
resorted
to
in
foul
weather
for
the
legislature
had
handicapped
the
coaching
trade
in
the
interests
of
the
watermen
and
coaches
were
few
and
dear
if
angela
had
loved
the
country
she
was
not
less
charmed
with
london
under
its
altered
aspect
all
this
gaiety
and
splendour
this
movement
and
brightness
astonished
and
dazzled
her
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
she
told
denzil
when
he
asked
her
opinion
of
london
it
seems
an
enchanted
place
and
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
is
the
same
dreadful
city
i
saw
a
few
months
ago
when
the
dead
were
lying
in
the
streets
oh
how
clearly
it
comes
back
to
me
those
empty
streets
the
smoke
of
the
fires
the
wretched
ragged
creatures
begging
for
bread
i
looked
down
a
narrow
court
and
saw
a
corpse
lying
there
and
a
child
wailing
over
it
and
a
little
way
farther
on
a
woman
flung
up
a
window
and
screamed
out
dead
the
last
of
my
children
is
dead
has
god
no
relenting
mercy
it
is
curious
said
hyacinth
how
little
the
town
seems
changed
after
all
those
horrors
i
miss
nobody
i
know
nay
madam
said
denzil
there
have
only
died
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
people
mostly
of
the
lower
classes
or
at
least
that
is
the
record
of
the
bills
but
i
am
told
the
mortality
has
been
twice
as
much
for
people
have
had
a
secret
way
of
dying
and
burying
their
dead
if
your
ladyship
could
have
heard
the
account
that
milton
gave
me
this
morning
of
the
sufferings
he
saw
before
he
left
london
you
would
not
think
the
visitation
a
light
one
i
wonder
you
consort
with
such
a
rebellious
subject
as
milton
said
hyacinth
a
creature
of
cromwell
who
wrote
with
hideous
malevolence
and
disrespect
of
the
murdered
king
who
was
in
hiding
for
ever
so
long
after
his
majesty
return
and
who
now
escapes
a
prison
only
by
the
royal
clemency
the
king
lacks
only
that
culminating
distinction
of
having
persecuted
the
greatest
poet
of
the
age
in
order
to
stand
equal
to
the
bigots
who
murdered
giordano
bruno
said
denzil
the
greatest
poet
sure
you
would
not
compare
milton
with
waller
indeed
i
would
not
lady
fareham
nor
with
cowley
nor
denham
dear
denham
nor
with
denham
to
my
fancy
he
stands
as
high
above
them
as
the
over
your
ladyship
garden
lamps
a
pamphleteer
who
has
scribbled
schoolboy
latin
verses
and
a
few
short
poems
and
let
me
see
a
masque
yes
a
masque
that
he
wrote
for
lord
bridgewater
children
before
the
troubles
i
have
heard
my
father
talk
of
it
i
think
he
called
the
thing
a
name
that
will
live
lady
fareham
when
waller
and
denham
are
shadows
remembered
only
for
an
occasional
couplet
oh
but
who
cares
what
people
will
think
two
or
three
hundred
years
hence
waller
verses
please
us
now
the
people
who
come
after
me
can
please
themselves
and
may
read
to
their
hearts
content
i
know
his
lordship
reads
milton
as
he
does
shakespeare
and
all
the
cramped
old
of
elizabeth
time
henri
sing
us
that
song
of
waller
lovely
rose
i
would
give
all
milton
has
written
for
that
perfection
they
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
above
the
river
in
the
golden
light
of
an
afternoon
that
was
fair
and
warm
as
may
though
by
the
calendar
was
march
the
capricious
climate
had
changed
from
austere
winter
to
smiling
spring
skylarks
were
singing
over
the
fields
at
hampstead
and
over
the
at
islington
and
all
london
was
rejoicing
in
blue
skies
and
sunshine
trade
was
awakening
from
a
sleep
the
theatres
were
closed
but
there
were
plays
acted
now
and
then
at
court
the
new
and
the
middle
exchange
were
alive
with
beribboned
fops
and
painted
belles
it
was
lady
fareham
the
tall
windows
of
her
saloon
were
open
to
the
terrace
french
windows
that
reached
from
ceiling
to
floor
like
those
at
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
and
which
hyacinth
had
substituted
for
the
small
jacobean
casements
when

of

ancestral
mansion

and
terrace
were
one
on
a
balmy
afternoon
like
this
and
her

guests
wandered
in
and
out
at
their
pleasure
her
lackeys
handing
chocolate
and
cakes
on
silver
or
gold
salvers
were
so
many
as
to
seem
ubiquitous
and
in
the
saloon
presided
over
by
angela
there
was
a
still
choicer
refreshment
to
be
obtained
at
a
where
tiny
cups
of
the
new
china
drink
were
dispensed
to
those
who
cared
for
exotic
novelties
prythee
take
your
guitar
and
sing
to
us
were
it
but
to
change
the
conversation
cried
hyacinth
and
de
malfort
took
up
his
guitar
and
began
in
the
sweetest
of
tenors
go
lovely
rose
he
had
all
her
ladyship
visitors
chiefly
feminine
round
him
before
he
had
finished
the
first
verse

gift
of
song
that
exquisite
touch
upon
the
spanish
guitar
were
irresistible
lord
fareham
landed
at
the
lower
flight
of
steps
as
the
song
ended
and
came
slowly
along
the
terrace
saluting
his
wife
friends
with
a
grave
courtesy
he
brought
an
atmosphere
of
silence
and
restraint
with
him
it
seemed
to
some
of
his
wife
visitors
for
the
babble
that
usually
follows
the
end
of

literature
and
professed
familiarity
with
two
books
which
had
caught
the
public
taste
on
opposite
sides
of
the
channel
in
london
people
quoted
butler
and
vowed
there
was
no
wit
so
racy
as
the
wit
in
hudibras
in
paris
the
cultured
were
all
striving
to
talk
like
rochefoucauld
maxims
which
had
lately
delighted
the
gallic
mind
by
the
frank
cynicism
that
drew
everybody
attention
to
somebody
else
failings
himself
the
vainest
of
men
is
scarce
wonderful
that
he
takes
vanity
to
be
the
mainspring
that
moves
the
human
species
said
de
malfort
when
some
one
had
found
fault
with
the
duke
analysis
oh
now
we
shall
hear
nothing
but
stale
rochefoucauldisms
sneers
at
love
and
friendship
disparagement
of
our
sex
where
has
my
grave
husband
been
i
wonder
said
hyacinth
upon
my
honour
fareham
your
brow
looks
as
sombre
as
if
it
were
burdened
with
the
care
of
the
nation
i
have
been
with
one
who
has
to
carry
the
greater
part
of
that
burden
my
lady
and
my
spirits
may
have
caught
some
touch
of
his
uneasiness
you
have
been
prosing
with
that
pragmatical
personage
at
dunkirk
nay
i
beg
the
lord
chancellor
pardon
clarendon
house
are
not
his
marbles
and
tapestries
much
finer
than
ours
and
yet
he
began
life
as
a
sneaking
lawyer
the
younger
son
of
a
small
wiltshire
squire
lady
fareham
you
allow
your
tongue
too
much
licence
nay
i
speak
but
the
common
feeling
everybody
is
tired
of
a
minister
who
is
a
hundred
years
behind
the
age
he
should
have
lived
under
elizabeth
a
pretty
woman
should
never
talk
politics
hyacinth
of
what
else
can
i
talk
when
the
theatres
are
closed
and
you
deny
me
the
privilege
of
seeing
the
last
comedy
performed
at
whitehall
is
it
not
rank
tyranny
in
his
lordship
lady
sarah
turning
to
one
of
her
intimates
a
lady
who
had
been
a
beauty
at
the
court
of
henrietta
maria
in
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
and
who
from
old
habit
still
thought
herself
lovely
and
beloved
i
appeal
to
your
ladyship
common
sense
is
it
not
monstrous
to
deprive
me
of
the
only
real
diversion
in
the
town
i
was
not
allowed
to
enter
a
theatre
at
all
last
year
except
when
his
favourite
shakespeare
or
fletcher
was
acted
and
that
was
but
a
dozen
times
i
believe
oh
hang
shakespeare
cried
a
gentleman
whose
periwig
occupied
nearly
as
much
space
against
the
blue
of
a
vernal
sky
as
all
the
rest
of
his
dapper
little
person
gud
my
lord
it
is
vastly
in
your
lordship
to
taste
shakespeare
protested
sir
ralph
masaroon
shaking
a
cloud
of
pulvilio
out
of
his
cataract
of
curls
there
was
a
pretty
enough
play
concocted
day
out
of
two
of
his
a
tragedy
and
comedy
for
and
ado
about
the
interstices
filled
in
with
the
utmost
ingenuity
but
shakespeare
unadulterated
faugh
i
am
a
fantastical
person
perhaps
sir
ralph
but
i
would
rather
my
wife
saw
ten
of
shakespeare
plays
in
spite
of
their
occasional
coarseness
than
one
of
your
modern
comedies
i
should
revolt
against
such
tyranny
said
lady
sarah
i
have
always
appreciated
shakespeare
but
i
adore
a
witty
comedy
and
i
never
allowed
my
husband
to
dictate
to
me
on
a
question
of
taste
plays
which
her
majesty
patronises
can
scarcely
be
unfit
entertainment
for
her
subjects
remarked
another
lady
our
portuguese
queen
is
an
excellent
judge
of
the
niceties
of
our
language
said
fareham
i
question
if
she
understands
five
sentences
in
as
many
acts
nor
should
understand
anything
low
or
vulgar
said
hyacinth
then
madam
you
are
best
at
home
for
the
whole
entertainment
would
be
hebrew
to
you
that
can
not
be
protested
lady
sarah
for
all
our
plays
are
written
by
gentlemen
the
hack
writers
of
king
james
time
have
been
shoved
aside
it
is
the
mark
of
a
man
of
quality
to
write
a
comedy
it
is
a
pity
that
fine
gentlemen
should
write
foul
jests
nay
it
is
a
subject
i
can
scarce
speak
of
with
patience
when
i
remember
what
the
english
stage
has
been
and
hear
what
it
is
when
i
recall
what
lord
clarendon
has
told
me
of
his
majesty
father
for
whom
shakespeare
was
a
closet
companion
who
loved
all
that
was
noblest
in
the
drama
of
the
elizabethan
age
time
which
should
have
refined
and
improved
the
stage
has
sunk
it
in
ignominy
we
stand
alone
among
nations
in
our
worship
of
the
obscene
you
have
seen
plays
enough
in
paris
hyacinth
recall
the
themes
that
pleased
you
at
the
marais
and
the
h√¥tel
de
bourgogne
the
stories
of
classic
heroism
of
christian
fortitude
of
manhood
and
womanhood
lifted
to
the
sublime
you
who
in
your
girlhood
were
familiar
with
the
austere
genius
of
corneille
i
am
sick
of
that
frenchman
name
interjected
lady
sarah
√©vremond
was
always
praising
him
and
had
the
audacity
to
pronounce
him
superior
to
dryden
to
compare
with
the
a
comparison
which
makes
one
sorry
for
dryden
said
fareham
i
have
heard
that
cond√©
when
a
young
man
was
affected
to
tears
at
the
scene
between
augustus
and
his
foe
he
must
have
been
very
young
said
lady
fareham
but
i
am
not
going
to
depreciate
corneille
or
to
pretend
that
the
french
theatre
is
not
vastly
superior
to
our
own
i
would
only
protest
that
if
our
king
prefers
farce
to
tragedy
and
rhyme
to
blankverse
his
subjects
should
accommodate
themselves
to
his
taste
and
enjoy
the
plays
he
likes
it
is
a
foolish
prejudice
that
deprives
me
of
such
a
pleasure
i
could
always
go
in
a
mask
can
you
put
a
mask
upon
your
mind
and
preserve
that
unstained
in
an
atmosphere
of
corruption
indeed
your
ladyship
does
not
know
what
you
are
asking
for
to
sit
and
simper
through
a
comedy
in
which
the
filthiest
subjects
are
discussed
in
the
vilest
language
to
see
all
that
is
foolish
or
lascivious
in
your
own
sex
exaggerated
with
a
malignant
licence
which
makes
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
an
epitome
of
all
the
vices
uniting
the
extreme
of
masculine
profligacy
with
the
extreme
of
feminine
silliness
will
you
encourage
by
your
presence
the
wretches
who
libel
your
sex
will
you
sit
smiling
to
see
your
sisters
in
the
pillory
of
satire
i
should
smile
as
at
a
fairy
tale
there
are
no
such
women
among
my
friends
and
if
the
satire
hits
an
enemy
it
is
all
the
more
pungent
said
lady
sarah
an
enemy
the
man
who
can
so
write
of
women
is
your
worst
enemy
the
day
will
come
perhaps
long
after
we
are
dust
when
the
women
in
will
be
thought
pictures
from
life
an
one
people
will
say
as
they
stand
to
read
your
epitaph
this
lady
sarah
whose
virtues
are
recorded
here
in
latin
superlatives
we
know
her
better
in
the
pages
of
shadwell
lady
sarah
paled
under
her
rouge
at
that
image
of
a
tomb
as
falcon
eye
singled
her
out
in
the
group
of
which
de
malfort
was
the
central
figure
sitting
on
the
marble
balustrade
in
an
easy
impertinent
attitude
swinging
his
legs
and
dandling
his
guitar
she
was
less
concerned
at
the
thought
of
what
posterity
might
say
of
her
morals
than
at
the
idea
that
she
must
inevitably
die
not
a
word
against
shad
protested
sir
ralph
i
have
roared
with
laughter
at
his
last
play
never
did
any
one
so
hit
the
follies
of
town
and
country
his
rural
put
is
perfection
his
london
rook
is
to
the
very
life
and
if
the
generality
of
his
female
characters
conduct
themselves
badly
there
is
always
one
heroine
of
irreproachable
morals
said
lady
sarah
who
talks
like
a
moral
dragoon
said
fareham
oh
dem
we
must
have
the
cried
masaroon
consider
how
dull
town
is
without
them
they
are
the
only
assemblies
that
please
quality
and
riffraff
alike
sure
is
the
nature
of
wit
to
bubble
into
licentiousness
as
champagne
foams
over
the
rim
of
a
glass
and
after
all
who
listens
to
the
play
half
the
time
one
is
talking
to
some
adventurous
miss
who
will
swallow
a
compliment
from
a
stranger
if
he
offer
it
with
a
china
orange
or
perhaps
there
is
quarrelling
and
all
our
eyes
and
ears
are
on
the
scufflers
one
may
ogle
a
pretty
actress
on
the
stage
but
who
listens
to
the
play
except
the
cits
and
commonalty
and
even
they
are
more
eyes
than
ears
said
lady
sarah
and
are
gazing
at
the
king
and
queen
or
the
duke
and
duchess
when
they
should
be
an
intrigue
by
shadwell
or
dryden
pardieu
exclaimed
de
malfort
there
are
tragedies
and
comedies
in
the
boxes
deeper
and
more
human
than
anything
that
is
acted
on
the
stage
to
watch
the
queen
sitting
silent
and
melancholy
while
madame
barbara
lolls
across
half
a
dozen
people
to
talk
to
his
majesty
dazzling
him
with
her
brilliant
eyes
bewildering
him
by
her
daring
speech
or
on
other
nights
to
see
the
same
lady
out
of
favour
sitting
apart
with
an
ivory
shoulder
turned
towards
royalty
scowling
at
the
audience
like
a
well
it
is
but
natural
perhaps
that
such
a
court
should
inspire
such
a
stage
returned
fareham
and
that
for
the
heroic
drama
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
webster
massinger
and
ford
we
should
have
a
gross
caricature
of
our
own
follies
and
our
own
vices
nay
so
essential
is
foulness
to
the
modern
stage
that
when
the
manager
ventures
a
serious
play
he
takes
care
to
introduce
it
with
some
filthy
prologue
and
to
spice
the
finish
with
a
filthier
epilogue
zounds
fareham
cried
masaroon
when
one
has
yawned
or
slept
through
five
acts
of
dull
heroics
one
needs
to
be
stung
into
wakefulness
by
a
epilogue
for
my
taste
your
epilogue
ca
be
too
pungent
to
give
a
flavour
to
my
oysters
and
rhenish
gud
my
lord
we
must
have
something
to
talk
about
when
we
leave
the
his
lordship
is
spoilt
we
are
all
spoilt
for
london
after
having
lived
in
the
most
exquisite
city
in

one
of
lady
fareham
particular
friends
who
had
been
educated
at
the
visitandines
with
the
princess
henrietta
now
duchess
of
orleans
who
can
tolerate
the
coarse
manners
and
fires
of
london
after
the
smokeless
skies
and
exquisite
courtesies
of
parisian
good
company
in
the
rue
thomas
du
louvre
a
society
so
refined
that
a
fault
in
grammar
shocks
as
much
as
a
slit
nose
at
charing
cross
i
shudder
when
i
recall
the
saturdays
in
the
rue
du
temple
and
compare
the
conversations
there
the
play
of
wit
and
fancy
the
elaborate
arguments
upon
platonic
love
the
graceful
raillery
with
any
assembly
in
london
except
yours
hyacinth
at
fareham
house
we
breathe
a
finer
air
although
his
lordship
esprit
moqueur
will
not
allow
us
any
superiority
to
the
coarse
english
mob
indeed
danville
even
your
prejudice
can
not
deny
london
fine
gentlemen
and
wits
remonstrated
sir
ralph
a
court
that
can
boast
a
buckhurst
a
rochester
an
etherege
a
sedley
there
is
not
one
of
them
can
compare
with
voiture
or
godeau
with
bussy
or
√©vremond
still
less
with
scarron
or
moli√®re
said
de
malfort
i
have
heard
more
wit
in
one
evening
at
scarron
than
in
a
week
at
whitehall
wit
in
france
has
its
basis
in
thought
and
erudition
here
it
is
the
sparkle
and
froth
of
empty
minds
a
trick
of
speech
a
knack
of
saying
brutal
things
under
a
pretence
of
humour
varnishing
real
impertinence
with
mock
wit
i
have
heard
rowley
laugh
at
insolences
which
addressed
to
louis
would
have
ensured
the
speaker
a
year
in
the
bastille
i
would
not
exchange
our
king
for
your
graceful
despot
said
fareham
pride
is
the
mainspring
that
moves
louis
soul
his
mother
instilled
it
into
his
mind
almost
before
he
could
speak
he
was
bred
in
the
belief
that
he
has
no
more
parallel
or
fellow
than
the
sun
which
he
has
chosen
for
his
emblem
and
then
for
moral
worth
he
is
little
better
than
his
cousin
louis
has
all
charles
elegant
vices
plus
tyranny
louis
is
every
inch
a
king
your
gentleman
at
whitehall
is
only
a
tradition
answered
de
malfort
he
is
but
an
extravagantly
paid
official
whose
office
is
a
sinecure
and
who
sells
something
of
his
prerogative
every
session
for
a
new
grant
of
money
i
dare
adventure
by
the
end
of
his
reign
charles
will
have
done
more
than
cromwell
to
increase
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
to
demonstrate
the
insignificance
of
kings
i
doubt
the
sinecurist
who
trusts
the
business
of
the
state
to
the
nation
representatives
will
wear
longer
than
your
officious
tyrant
who
wants
to
hold
all
the
strings
in
his
own
fingers
he
may
do
that
safely
so
long
as
he
has
men
like
colbert
for
puppets
men
cried
fareham
a
man
of
so
rare
an
honesty
must
not
be
thought
of
in
the
plural
colbert
talent
probity
and
honour
constitute
a
phoenix
that
appears
once
in
a
century
and
given
those
rare
qualities
in
the
man
it
needs
a
richelieu
to
inspire
the
minister
and
a
mazarin
to
teach
him
his
craft
and
to
prepare
him
for
in
others
which
his
own
direct
mind
could
never
have
imagined
trained
first
by
one
of
the
greatest
and
next
by
one
of
the
subtlest
statesmen
the
world
has
ever

the
provincial
son

all
the
qualities
needed
to
raise
france
to
the

if

said
de

colbert
adores
the

and
is
blind
to
his

are
no

observed

so
foolishly
fond

wallow
in
extravagance
and
asked
no
questions
and
for
a
man
who
had
worn
threadbare
velvet
and
tarnished
gold
and
lived
upon
loans
and
gratuities
from
foreign
princes
and
particulars
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
draw
upon
a
national
exchequer
the
exchequer
rowley
draws
upon
should
be
as
deep
and
wide
as
the
river
pactolus
for
he
is
a
spendthrift
by
instinct
said
fareham
yet
his
largest
expenditure
can
hardly
equal
his
cousin
drain
upon
the
revenue
mansart
is
spending
millions
on
versailles
with
his
bastard
italian
architecture
his
bloated
garlands
and
festoons
his
stone
lilies
and
pomegranates
charles
builds
no
palaces
initiates
no
war
and
will
leave
neither
palace
nor
monument
will
have
lived
only
to
have
diminished
the
dignity
and
importance
of
his
country
restored
to
kingdom
and
power
as
if
by
a
miracle
he
makes
it
his
chief
business
to
show
englishmen
how
well
they
could
have
done
without
him
said
denzil
warner
who
had
been
hanging
over
angela
until
just
now
when
they
both
sauntered
on
to
the
terrace
the
lady
office
being
fulfilled
the
little
chinese
teapot
emptied
of
its
costly
contents
and
the
tiny
distributed
among
the
modish
few
who
relished
or
pretended
to
relish
the
new
drink
you
are
a
republican
sir
denzil
fostered
by
an
arrant
demagogue
exclaimed
masaroon
with
a
contemptuous
shake
of
his
shoulder
ribbons
you
hate
the
king
because
he
is
a
king
no
sir
i
despise
him
because
he
is
so
much
less
than
a
king
nobody
could
hate
charles
the
second
he
is
not
big
enough
oh
dem
we
want
no
meddlesome
kings
to
quarrel
with
their
neighbours
and
set
europe
by
the
ears
the
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
may
be
a
fine
thing
for
france
but
how
many
noble
gentlemen
lives
it
cost
to
say
nothing
of
the
common
people
rowley
is
the
finest
gentleman
in
his
kingdom
and
the
most
eh
gud
sirs
what
more
would
you
have
a
man
like
henry
the
fifth
or
oliver
cromwell
or
elizabeth
faith
she
had
need
possess
the
manly
virtues
for
she
must
have
been
an
untowardly
female
a
sour
spinster
with
all
the
inclinations
but
none
of
the
qualities
of
a
coquette
greatness
has
the
privilege
of
small
failings
or
it
would
scarce
be
human
elizabeth
and
julius
caesar
might
be
excused
some
harmless
vanities
the
spring
evenings
were
now
mild
enough
for
promenading
james
park
and
the
mall
was
crowded
night
after
night
by
the
finest
company
in
london
hyacinth
walked
in
the
mall
and
appeared
occasionally
in
her
coach
in
hyde
park
but
she
repeatedly
reminded
her
friends
how
inferior
was
the
of
the
ring
to
the
procession
of
open
carriages
along
the
cours
la
reine
by
the
side
of
the
seine
the
splendour
of
the
women
dress
outshone
sometimes
by
the
extravagant
decoration
of
their
coaches
and
the
richness
of
their
liveries
the
crowds
of
horsemen
the
finest
gentlemen
in
france
riding
at
the
coach
doors
and
bandying
jests
and
compliments
with
beauty
enthroned
in
her
triumphal
chariot
gay
joyous
sunsets
light
laughter
delicate
feasting
in
renard
garden
hard
by
the
tuileries
to
remember
that
fairer
and
different
scene
was
to
recall
the
freshness
of
youth
the
romance
of
a
first
love
here
in
the
mall
there
was
gaiety
enough
and
to
spare
a
crowd
of
fine
people
that
sometimes
thickened
to
a
mob
hustled
by
the
cits
and
starveling
poets
who
came
to
stare
at
them
yet
since
james
park
was
fashion
favourite
promenade
lady
fareham
affected
it
and
took
a
turn
or
two
nearly
every
evening
alighting
from
her
chair
at
one
gate
and
returning
to
it
at
another
on
her
way
to
rout
or
dance
she
took
angela
with
her
and
de
malfort
and
sir
denzil
were
generally
in
attendance
upon
them
denzil
devotion
stopping
at
nothing
except
a
proposal
of
marriage
for
which
he
had
not
mustered
courage
in
a
friendship
that
had
lasted
half
a
year
because
there
was
one
so
favoured
as
endymion
am
i
to
hope
for
the
moon
to
come
down
and
give
herself
to
me
he
said
one
day
when
lady
fareham
rebuked
him
for
his
reticence
i
know
your
sister
does
not
love
me
yet
i
hang
on
hoping
that
love
will
come
suddenly
like
the
coming
of
spring
which
is
ever
a
surprise
and
even
if
i
am
never
to
win
her
it
is
happiness
to
see
her
and
to
talk
with
her
i
will
not
spoil
my
chance
by
rashness
i
will
not
hazard
banishment
from
her
dear
company
she
is
lucky
in
such
an
admirer
sighed
hyacinth
a
silent
respectful
passion
is
the
rarest
thing
nowadays
well
you
deserve
to
conquer
denzil
and
if
my
sister
were
not
of
the
coldest
nature
i
ever
met
in
woman
she
would
have
returned
your
passion
ages
ago
when
you
were
so
much
in
her
company
at
chilton
i
can
afford
to
wait
as
long
as
the
greeks
waited
before
troy
said
denzil
and
i
will
be
as
constant
as
they
were
if
i
can
not
be
her
lover
i
can
be
her
friend
and
her
protector
protector
nay
surely
she
needs
no
protector
when
she
has
fareham
and
me
within
beauty
has
always
need
of
defenders
not
such
beauty
as
angela
in
the
first
place
her
charms
are
of
no
dazzling
order
and
in
the
second
she
has
a
coldness
of
temper
and
an
wisdom
which
would
safeguard
her
amidst
the
rabble
rout
of
comus
there
i
believe
you
are
right
lady
fareham
temptation
could
not
touch
her
sin
even
the
subtlest
could
not
so
disguise
itself
that
her
purity
would
not
take
alarm
yes
she
is
like
milton
lady
the
tempter
could
not
touch
the
freedom
of
her
mind
sinful
love
would
wither
at
a
look
from
those
pure
eyes
he
turned
away
suddenly
and
walked
to
the
window
denzil
why
what
is
the
matter
you
are
weeping
forgive
me
he
said
recovering
himself
indeed
i
am
not
ashamed
of
a
tributary
tear
to
virtue
and
beauty
like
your
sister
dear
friend
i
shall
not
be
happy
till
i
call
you
brother
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
and
he
bent
down
to
kiss
them
i
swear
you
are
losing
all
your
anabaptist
stiffness
she
said
laughingly
you
will
be
ruffling
it
in
covent
garden
with
buckhurst
and
his
crew

l√©onie
de

now
married
to
the
baron
de
beaulieu
and
established
in
a
fine
house
in
the
place
royale
will
best
depict
her
life
and
thoughts
and
feelings
during
her
first
london
season
you
tell
me
ch√®re
that
this
london
which
i
have
painted
in
somewhat
brilliant
colours
must
be
a
poor
place
compared
with
your
exquisite
city
but
indeed
despite
all
you
say
of
the
cours
la
reine
and
your
splendour
of
gilded
coaches
fine
ladies
and
noble
gentlemen
who
ride
at
your
coach
windows
talking
to
you
as
they
rein
in
their
spirited
horses
i
can
not
think
that
your
fashionable
promenade
can
so
much
surpass
our
ring
in
hyde
park
where
the
court
airs
itself
daily
in
the
new
glass
coaches
or
outvie
for
gaiety
our
mall
in
james
park
where
all
the
world
of
beauty
and
wit
is
to
be
met
walking
up
and
down
in
the
gayest
easiest
way
everybody
familiar
and
acquainted
with
the
exception
of
a
few
women
in
masks
who
are
never
to
be
spoken
to
or
spoken
about
indeed
my
sister
and
i
have
acquired
the
art
of
appearing
neither
to
see
nor
to
hear
objectionable
company
and
pass
close
beside
fine
flaunting
masks
rub
shoulders
with
them
even
and
all
as
if
we
saw
them
not
it
is
for
this
that
lord
fareham
hates
london
here
he
says
vice
takes
the
highest
place
and
flaunts
in
the
sun
while
virtue
blushes
and
steals
by
with
averted
head
but
though
i
wonder
at
this
court
of
whitehall
and
the
wicked
woman
who
reigns
empress
there
and
the
neglected
queen
and
the
ladies
of
honour
whose
bad
conduct
is
on
every
one
lips
i
wonder
more
at
the
people
and
the
life
you
describe
at
the
louvre
and
germain
and
fontainebleau
and
your
new
palace
of
versailles
indeed
l√©onie
the
world
must
be
in
a
strange
way
when
vice
can
put
on
all
the
grace
and
dignity
of
virtue
and
hold
an
honourable
place
among
good
and
noble
women
my
sister
says
that
madame
de
montausier
is
a
woman
of
stainless
character
and
her
husband
the
proudest
of
men
yet
you
tell
me
that
both
husband
and
wife
are
full
of
kindness
and
favours
for
that
unhappy
mlle
de
la
valli√®re
whose
position
at
court
is
an
open
insult
to
your
queen
have
queens
often
been
so
unhappy
i
wonder
as
her
majesty
here
and
your
own
royal
mistress
one
at
least
was
not
the
martyred
king
was
of
all
husbands
the
most
constant
and
affectionate
and
in
the
opinion
of
many
lost
his
kingdom
chiefly
through
his
fatal
indulgence
of
queen
henrietta
caprices
and
his
willingness
to
be
governed
by
her
opinions
in
circumstances
of
difficulty
where
only
the
wisest
heads
in
the
land
should
have
counselled
him
but
how
i
am
wandering
from
my
defence
of
this
beautiful
city
against
your
assertion
of
its
inferiority
i
hope
ch√®re
that
you
will
cross
the
sea
some
day
and
allow
my
sister
to
lodge
you
in
this
house
where
i
write
and
when
you
look
out
upon
our
delightful
river
with
its
gay
traffic
of
boats
and
barges
passing
to
and
fro
and
its
palaces
rising
from
gardens
and
italian
terraces
on
either
side
of
the
stream
when
you
see
our
ancient
cathedral
of
paul
and
the
abbey
of
peter
lying
a
little
back
from
the
water
grand
and
ancient
and
somewhat
gloomy
in
its
massive
bulk
and
eastward
the
old
with
its
four
towers
and
the
ships
lying
in
the
pool
and
fertile
bermondsey
with
its
gardens
and
all
the
beauty
of
verdant
shores
and
citizens
houses
between
the
bridge
and
greenwich
you
will
own
that
london
and
its
adjacent
villages
can
compare
favourably
with
any
metropolis
in
the
world
the
only
complaint
one
hears
is
of
its
rapid
growth
which
is
fast
encroaching
upon
the
pleasant
fields
and
rustic
lanes
behind
the
lambs
conduit
and
southampton
house
and
on
the
western
side
spreading
so
rapidly
that
there
will
soon
be
no
country
left
between
london
and
knightsbridge
how
i
wish
thou
couldst
see
our
on
my
sister
when
de
malfort
is
lolling
on
the
marble
balustrade
singing
one
of
your
favourite
chansons
to
the
guitar
which
he
touches
so
exquisitely
and
when
hyacinth
fine
lady
friends
and
foppish
admirers
are
sitting
about
in
the
sunshine
thou
wouldst
confess
that
even
renard
garden
can
show
no
gayer
scene
it
was
only
last
tuesday
that
i
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
more
of
the
city
than
i
had
seen
previously
and
at
its
best
advantage
as
seen
from
the
river
evelyn
of
sayes
court
had
invited
my
sister
and
her
husband
to
visit
his
house
and
gardens
he
is
a
great
gardener
and
arboriculturist
as
you
may
have
heard
for
he
has
travelled
much
on
the
continent
and
acquired
a
reputation
for
his
knowledge
of
trees
and
flowers
we
were
all
invited
the
farehams
and
my
niece
henriette
and
even
i
whom
evelyn
had
seen
but
once
was
included
in
the
invitation
we
were
to
travel
by
water
in
his
lordship
barge
and
evelyn
coach
was
to
meet
us
at
a
not
far
from
his
house
we
were
to
start
in
the
morning
dine
with
him
and
return
to
fareham
house
before
dark
henriette
was
enchanted
and
i
found
her
at
prayers
on
monday
night
praying
swithin
whom
she
believes
to
have
care
of
the
weather
to
allow
no
rain
on
tuesday
she
looked
so
pretty
next
morning
dressed
for
the
journey
in
a
light
blue
cloth
cloak
embroidered
with
silver
and
a
hood
of
the
same
but
she
brought
me
bad
news
my
sister
had
a
feverish
headache
and
begged
us
to
go
without
her
i
went
to
hyacinth
room
to
try
to
persuade
her
to
go
with
us
in
the
hope
that
the
fresh
air
along
the
river
would
cure
her
headache
but
she
had
been
at
a
dance
overnight
and
was
tired
and
would
do
nothing
but
rest
in
a
dark
room
all
day
at
least
that
was
her
resolve
in
the
morning
but
later
she
remembered
that
it
was
lady
lucretia
and
feeling
better
ordered
her
chair
and
went
off
to
bloomsbury
square
where
she
met
all
the
wits
full
of
a
new
play
which
had
been
acted
at
whitehall
the
public
theatres
being
still
closed
on
account
of
the
late
contagion
they
do
not
act
their
plays
here
as
often
as
moli√®re
is
acted
at
the
h√¥tel
de
bourgogne
the
town
is
constant
in
nothing
but
wanting
perpetual
variety
and
the
stir
and
bustle
of
a
new
play
which
gives
something
for
the
wits
to
dispute
about
i
think
we
must
have
three
to
one
of
yours
but
i
doubt
if
there
is
wit
enough
in
a
dozen
of
our
writers
to
equal
your
moli√®re
whose
last
comedy
seems
to
surpass
all
that
has
gone
before
his
lordship
had
a
copy
from
paris
last
week
and
read
the
play
to
us
in
the
evening
he
has
no
accent
and
reads
french
beautifully
with
spirit
and
fire
and
in
the
passionate
scenes
his
great
deep
voice
has
a
fine
effect
we
left
fareham
house
at
nine
on
a
lovely
morning
worthy
this
month
of
may
the
lessening
of
fires
in
the
city
since
the
warmer
weather
has
freed
our
skies
from
smoke
and
the
sky
last
tuesday
was
bluer
than
the
river
the
and
gold
barge
with
twelve
rowers
in
the
fareham
green
velvet
liveries
would
have
pleased
your
eyes
which
have
ever
loved
splendour
but
you
might
have
thought
the
master
of
this
splendid
barge
too
sombre
in
dress
and
aspect
to
become
a
scene
which
recalled
galley
to
me
there
is
much
that
is
interesting
in
that
severe
and
serious
face
with
its
olive
complexion
and
dark
eyes
shadowed
by
the
strong
thoughtful
brow
people
who
knew
lord
stafford
say
that
my
has
a
look
of
that
great
unfortunate
man
sacrificed
to
stem
the
rising
flood
of
rebellion
and
sacrificed
in
vain
fareham
is
his
kinsman
on
the
mother
side
and
may
have
perhaps
something
of
his
powerful
mind
together
with
the
rugged
grandeur
of
his
features
and
the
bent
carriage
of
his
shoulders
which
some
one
the
other
day
called
the
stratford
stoop
i
have
been
reading
some
of
lord
stafford
letters
and
the
account
of
his
trial
indeed
he
was
an
man
and
the
victim
of
private
hatred
from
the
vanes
and
others
as
much
as
of
public
faction
his
trial
and
condemnation
were
scarce
less
unfair
though
the
form
and
tribunal
may
have
been
legal
than
his
master
and
indeed
did
but
forecast
that
most
unwarrantable
judgment
is
it
not
strange
l√©onie
to
consider
how
much
of
tragical
history
you
and
i
have
lived
through
that
are
yet
so
young
but
to
me
it
is
strangest
of
all
to
see
the
people
in
this
city
who
abandon
themselves
as
freely
to
a
life
of
idle
pleasures
and
sinful
folly
at
least
the
majority
of
them
as
if
england
had
never
seen
the
tragedy
of
the
late
monarch
murder
or
been
visited
by
death
in
his
most
horrible
aspect
only
the
year
last
past
my
sister
tells
every
one
smiling
that
she
misses
no
one
from
the
circle
of
her
friends
she
never
saw
the
red
cross
on
almost
every
door
the
coffins
and
the
uncoffined
dead
as
i
saw
them
one
stifling
summer
day
nor
heard
the
shrieks
of
the
mourners
in
houses
where
death
was
master
nor
does
she
suspect
how
near
she
was
to
missing
her
husband
who
was
hanging
between
life
and
death
when
i
found
him
forsaken
and
alone
he
never
talks
to
me
of
those
days
of
sickness
and
slow
recovery
yet
i
think
the
memory
of
them
must
be
in
his
mind
as
it
is
in
mine
and
that
this
serves
as
a
link
to
draw
us
nearer
than
many
a
real
brother
and
sister
i
am
sending
you
a
little
picture
which
i
made
of
him
from
memory
for
he
has
one
of
those
striking
faces
that
paint
themselves
easily
upon
the
mind
tell
me
how
you
who
are
clever
at
reading
faces
interpret
this
one
h√©las
how
i
wander
from
our
excursion
my
pen
winds
like
the
river
which
carried
us
to
deptford
pardon
ch√®rie
sije
trop
mais
si
doux
de
causer
avec
une
amie
at
the
tower
stairs
we
stopped
to
take
on
board
a
gentleman
in
a
very
fine
suit
and
with
a
huge
periwig
at
which
papillon
began
to
laugh
and
had
to
be
chid
somewhat
harshly
he
was
a
very
friendly
person
and
he
brought
with
him
a
lad
carrying
a
viol
he
is
an
officer
of
the
admiralty
called
pepys
and
fareham
tells
me
a
useful
indefatigable
person
my
sister
met
him
at
clarendon
house
two
years
ago
and
wrote
to
me
about
him
somewhat
scornfully
but
my
brother
respects
him
as
shrewd
and
capable
and
more
honest
than
such
persons
usually
are
we
were
to
fetch
him
to
sayes
court
where
he
also
was
invited
by
evelyn
and
in
talking
to
henriette
and
me
he
expressed
great
regret
that
his
wife
had
not
been
included
and
he
paid
my
niece
compliments
upon
her
grace
and
beauty
which
i
could
but
think
very
fulsome
and
showing
want
of
judgment
in
addressing
a
child
and
then
seeing
me
vexed
he
hoped
i
was
not
jealous
at
which
i
could
hardly
command
my
anger
and
rose
in
a
huff
and
left
him
but
he
was
a
person
not
easy
to
keep
at
a
distance
and
was
following
me
to
the
prow
of
the
boat
when
fareham
took
hold
of
him
by
his
cannon
sleeve
and
led
him
to
a
seat
where
he
kept
him
talking
of
the
navy
and
the
great
ships
now
to
replace
those
that
have
been
lost
in
the
dutch
war
when
we
had
passed
the
pool
and
the
busy
trading
ships
and
all
the
noise
of
sailors
and
labourers
shipping
or
unloading
cargo
and
the
traffic
of
small
boats
hastening
to
and
fro
and
were
out
on
a
broad
reach
of
the
river
with
the
green
country
on
either
side
the
lad
tuned
his
viol
and
played
a
pretty
pensive
air
and
he
and
pepys
sang
some
verses
by
herrick
one
of
our
favourite
english
poets
set
for
two
voices
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
old
time
still
is
and
this
same
flower
that
smiles
will
be
dying
the
boy
had
a
voice
like
mere
ursule
lovely
soprano
and
pepys
a
pretty
tenor
and
you
can
imagine
nothing
more
silvery
sweet
than
the
union
of
the
two
voices
to
the
staccato
notes
of
the
viol
dropping
in
here
and
there
like
music
whispered
the
setting
was
pepys
own
and
he
seemed
overcome
with
pride
when
we
praised
it
when
the
song
was
over
fareham
came
to
the
bench
where
papillon
and
i
were
sitting
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
this
fine
admiralty
gentleman
whereupon
i
confessed
i
liked
the
song
better
than
the
singer
who
at
that
moment
was
strutting
on
the
deck
like
a
peacock
looking
at
every
vessel
we
passed
as
if
he
were
neptune
and
could
sink
navies
with
a
nod
misericorde
how
my
letter
grows
but
i
love
to
prattle
to
you
my
sister
is
all
goodness
to
me
but
she
has
her
ideas
and
i
have
mine
and
though
i
love
her
none
the
less
because
our
fancies
pull
us
in
opposite
directions
i
can
not
talk
to
her
as
i
can
write
to
you
and
if
i
plague
you
with
too
much
of
my
own
history
you
must
not
fear
to
tell
me
so
yet
if
i
dare
judge
by
my
own
feelings
who
am
never
weary
of
your
letters
nay
can
never
hear
enough
of
your
thoughts
and
doings
i
think
you
will
bear
with
my
expatiations
and
not
deem
them
too
impertinent
evelyn
coach
was
waiting
at
the
and
that
good
gentleman
received
us
at
his
hall
door
he
is
not
young
and
has
gone
through
much
affliction
in
the
loss
of
his
dear
children
one
who
died
of
a
fever
during
that
wicked
reign
of
the
usurper
cromwell
was
a
boy
of
gifts
and
capacities
that
seemed
almost
miraculous
and
had
more
scholarship
at
five
years
old
than
my
poor
woman
mind
could
compass
were
i
to
live
till
fifty
evelyn
took
a
kind
of
sad
delight
in
talking
to
henriette
and
me
of
this
gifted
child
asking
her
what
she
knew
of
this
and
that
subject
and
comparing
her
extensive
ignorance
at
eleven
with
his
lamented
son
vast
knowledge
at
five
i
was
more
sorry
for
him
than
i
dared
to
say
for
i
could
but
think
this
dear
overtaught
child
might
have
died
from
a
perpetual
fever
of
the
brain
as
likely
as
from
a
four
fever
of
the
body
and
afterwards
when
evelyn
talked
to
us
of
a
manner
of
forcing
fruits
to
grow
in
strange
shapes
a
process
in
which
he
was
greatly
interested
i
thought
that
this
dear
infant
mind
had
been
constrained
and
directed
like
the
fruits
into
a
form
unnatural
to
childhood
picture
to
yourself
l√©onie
at
an
age
when
he
should
have
been
chasing
butterflies
or
making
himself
a
garden
of
stuck
in
the
ground
this
child
was
labouring
over
greek
and
latin
and
all
his
dreams
must
have
been
filled
with
the
toilsome
perplexities
of
his
daily
tasks
it
is
happy
for
the
bereaved
father
that
he
takes
a
different
view
and
that
his
pride
in
the
child
learning
is
even
greater
than
his
grief
at
having
lost
him
at
dinner
the
conversation
was
chiefly
of
public
affairs
the
navy
the
war
the
king
the
duke
and
the
general
evelyn
told
fareham
much
of
his
embarrassments
last
year
when
he
had
the
dutch
prisoners
and
the
sick
and
wounded
from
the
fleet
in
his
charge
and
when
there
was
so
terrible
a
scarcity
of
provision
for
these
poor
wretches
that
he
was
constrained
to
draw
largely
on
his
own
private
means
in
order
to
keep
them
from
starving
later
during
the
long
dinner
pepys
made
allusions
to
an
unhappy
passion
of
his
master
and
patron
lord
sandwich
that
had
diverted
his
mind
from
public
business
and
was
likely
to
bring
him
to
disgrace
nothing
was
said
plainly
about
this
matter
but
rather
in
hints
and
innuendoes
and
my
brother
brow
darkened
as
the
conversation
went
on
and
then
at
last
after
sitting
silent
for
some
time
while
evelyn
and
pepys
conversed
he
broke
up
their
discourse
in
a
rough
abrupt
way
he
has
when
greatly
moved
is
a
wretch
a
guilty
wretch
to
love
where
he
should
not
to
hazard
the
world
esteem
to
grieve
his
wife
and
to
dishonour
his
name
and
yet
i
wonder
is
he
happier
in
his
sinful
indulgence
than
if
he
had
played
a
roman
part
or
like
the
spartan
lad
we
read
of
had
let
the
passion
gnaw
his
heart
out
and
yet
made
no
sign
to
suffer
and
die
that
is
virtue
i
take
it
evelyn
and
you
christian
sages
assure
us
that
virtue
is
happiness
a
strange
kind
of
happiness
christian
law
is
a
law
of
sacrifice
evelyn
said
in
his
melancholic
way
harvest
of
surrender
here
is
to
be
garnered
in
a
better
world
if
sandwich
does
not
believe
in
the
everlasting
joys
of
the
heavenly
jerusalem
and
prefers
to
anticipate
his
harvest
of
joy
said
fareham
he
is
the
more
to
be
pitied
interrupted
evelyn
is
as
god
made
him
nothing
can
come
out
of
a
man
but
what
his
maker
put
in
him
your
gold
vase
there
will
not
turn
vicious
and
produce
copper
nor
can
all
your
alchemy
turn
copper
to
gold
there
are
some
of
us
who
believe
that
a
man
can
live
only
once
and
love
only
once
and
be
happy
only
once
in
that
pitiful
span
of
infirmities
which
we
call
life
and
that
he
is
wisest
who
gathers
his
roses
while
he
may
as
pepys
sang
to
us
this
morning
evelyn
sighed
and
looked
at
my
brother
with
mild
reproof
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
christ
we
are
of
all
men
most
miserable
he
said
lord
when
those
you
love
people
the
heavenly
city
you
will
begin
to
believe
and
hope
as
i
do
i
have
transcribed
this
conversation
at
full
length
l√©onie
because
it
gives
you
the
keynote
to
fareham
character
and
accounts
for
much
that
is
strange
in
his
conduct
alas
that
i
must
say
it
of
so
noble
a
man
he
is
an
infidel
bred
in
our
church
he
has
faith
neither
in
the
church
nor
in
its
divine
founder
his
favourite
books
are
metaphysical
works
by
descartes
hobbes
spinoza
i
have
discovered
him
reading
those
pernicious
writings
whose
chief
tendency
is
to
make
us
question
the
most
blessed
truths
our
church
has
taught
us
or
to
confuse
the
mind
by
leading
us
to
doubt
even
of
our
own
existence
i
was
curious
to
know
what
there
could
be
in
books
that
so
interested
a
man
of
his
intelligence
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
read
them
but
the
perusal
only
served
to
make
me
unhappy
this
daring
attempt
to
reduce
all
the
mysteries
of
life
to
a
simple
sum
in
arithmetic
and
to
make
god
a
mere
attribute
in
the
mind
of
man
disturbed
and
depressed
me
indeed
there
can
be
no
more
unhappy
moment
in
any
life
than
that
in
which
for
the
first
time
a
terrible
flashes
upon
the
mind
god
is
not
the
god
i
have
worshipped
and
in
whose
goodness
i
rest
all
my
hopes
of
future
bliss
in
the
place
of
an
creator
who
gave
me
my
life
and
governs
it
and
will
renew
it
after
the
grave
there
is
nothing
but
a
quality
of
my
mind
which
makes
it
necessary
to
me
to
invent
a
superior
being
and
to
worship
the
product
of
my
own
imagination
oh
l√©onie
beware
of
these
modern
thinkers
who
assail
the
creed
that
has
been
the
stronghold
and
comfort
of
humanity
for
sixteen
hundred
years
and
who
employ
the
reason
which
god
has
given
them
to
disprove
the
existence
of
their
maker
fareham
insists
that
spinoza
is
a
religious
man
and
has
beautiful
ideas
about
god
but
i
found
only
doubt
and
despair
in
his
pages
and
i
ascribe
my
poor
brother
melancholic
disposition
in
some
part
to
his
study
of
such
philosophers
i
wonder
what
you
would
think
of
fareham
did
you
see
him
daily
and
hourly
almost
as
i
do
would
you
like
or
dislike
admire
or
scorn
him
i
can
not
tell
his
manners
have
none
of
the
velvet
softness
which
is
the
fashion
in
london
where
all
the
fine
gentlemen
shape
themselves
upon
the
parisian
model
yet
he
is
courteous
after
his
graver
mode
to
all
women
and
kind
and
thoughtful
of
our
happiness
to
my
sister
he
is
all
beneficence
and
if
he
has
a
fault
it
is
indulgence
of
her
whims
and
extravagances
though
hyacinth
poor
soul
thinks
him
a
tyrant
because
he
forbids
her
some
places
of
amusement
to
which
other
women
of
quality
resort
freely
were
he
my
husband
i
should
honour
him
for
his
desire
to
spare
me
all
evil
sounds
and
profligate
company
and
so
would
hyacinth
perhaps
had
she
leisure
for
reflection
but
in
her
london
life
surrounded
ever
with
a
bevy
of
friends
moving
like
a
star
amidst
a
galaxy
of
great
ladies
there
is
little
time
for
the
free
exercise
of
a
sound
judgment
and
she
can
but
think
as
others
bid
her
who
swear
that
her
husband
is
a
despot
evelyn
was
absent
from
home
on
a
visit
so
after
dinner
henriette
and
i
having
no
hostess
to
entertain
us
walked
with
our
host
who
showed
us
all
the
curiosities
and
beauties
of
his
garden
and
condescended
to
instruct
us
upon
many
interesting
particulars
relating
to
trees
and
flowers
and
the
methods
of
cultivation
pursued
in
various
countries
his
fig
trees
are
as
fine
as
those
in
the
convent
garden
at
louvain
and
indeed
walking
with
him
in
a
long
alley
shut
in
by
holly
hedges
of
which
he
is
especially
proud
and
with
orchard
trees
on
either
side
i
was
taken
back
in
fancy
to
the
old
pathway
along
which
you
and
i
have
paced
so
often
with
mother
agnes
talking
of
the
time
when
we
should
go
out
into
the
world
you
have
been
more
than
three
years
in
that
world
of
which
you
then
knew
so
little
but
it
lacks
still
a
quarter
of
one
year
since
i
left
that
quiet
and
so
monotonous
life
and
already
i
look
back
and
wonder
if
i
ever
really
lived
there
i
can
not
picture
myself
within
those
walls
i
can
not
call
back
my
own
feelings
or
my
own
image
at
the
time
when
i
had
never
seen
london
when
my
sister
was
almost
a
stranger
to
me
and
my
sister
husband
only
a
name
yet
a
day
of
sorrow
might
come
when
i
should
be
fain
to
find
a
tranquil
retreat
in
that
sober
place
and
to
spend
my
declining
years
in
prayer
and
meditation
as
my
dear
aunt
did
spend
nearly
all
her
life
may
god
maintain
us
in
the
true
faith
sweet
friend
so
that
we
may
ever
have
that
sanctuary
of
holy
seclusion
and
prayer
to
fly
to
and
oh
how
deep
should
be
our
pity
for
a
soul
like
fareham
which
knows
not
the
consolations
nor
the
strength
of
religion
for
whom
there
is
no
armour
against
the
arrows
of
death
no
city
of
refuge
in
the
day
of
mourning
indeed
he
is
not
happy
i
question
and
perplex
myself
to
find
a
reason
for
his
melancholy
he
is
rich
in
money
and
in
powerful
friends
has
a
wife
whom
all
the
world
admires
houses
which
might
lodge
royalty
perhaps
it
is
because
his
life
has
been
over
prosperous
that
he
sickens
of
it
like
one
who
flings
away
from
a
banquet
table
satiated
by
feasting
life
to
him
may
be
like
the
weariness
of
our
english
dinners
where
one
mountain
of
food
is
carried
away
to
make
room
on
the
board
for
another
and
where
after
people
have
sat
eating
and
drinking
for
over
an
hour
comes
a
roasted
swan
or
a
peacock
or
some
other
fantastical
dish
which
the
company
praise
as
a
pretty
surprise
often
in
the
midst
of
such
a
dinner
i
recall
our
sparing
meals
in
the
convent
our
soup
maigre
and
snow
eggs
our
cool
salads
and
black
bread
and
regret
that
simple
food
while
the
reeking
joints
and
hecatombs
of
fowl
nauseate
my
senses
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
returned
to
the
barge
for
pepys
had
business
to
transact
with
our
host
and
spent
an
hour
with
him
in
his
study
signing
papers
and
looking
at
accounts
while
papillon
and
i
roamed
about
the
garden
with
his
lordship
conversing
upon
various
subjects
and
about
evelyn
and
his
opinions
and
politics
good
man
has
a
pretty
trivial
taste
that
will
keep
him
amused
and
happy
till
he
drops
into
the
grave
but
lord
what
insipid
trash
it
all
seems
to
the
heart
on
fire
with
passion
fareham
said
in
his
impetuous
way
as
if
he
despised
evelyn
for
taking
pleasure
in
bagatelles
the
sun
was
setting
as
we
passed
greenwich
and
i
thought
of
those
who
had
lived
and
made
history
in

so
brave

adventurous
so

those

come

remember

that
they
lived
and
died
pepys
was
somewhat
noisy
on
the
evening
voyage
and
i
was
very
glad
when
he
left
the
barge
he
paid
me
ridiculous
compliments
mixed
with
scraps
of
french
and
spanish
and
finding
his
conversation
distasteful
he
insisted
upon
attempting
several
songs
not
one
of
which
he
was
able
to
finish
and
at
last
began
one
which
for
some
reason
made
his
lordship
angry
who
gave
him
a
cuff
on
his
head
that
scattered
all
the
scented
powder
in
his
wig
on
which
instead
of
starting
up
furious
to
return
the
blow
as
i
feared
to
see
him
pepys
gave
a
little
whimpering
laugh
muttered
something
to
the
effect
that
his
lordship
was
vastly
nice
and
sank
down
in
a
corner
of
the
cushioned
seat
where
he
almost
instantly
fell
asleep

and
i
were
spectators
of
this
scene
at
some
distance
i
am
glad
to
say
for
all
the
length
of
the
barge
divided
us
from
the
noisy
singer
the
sun
went
down
and
the
stars
stole
out
of
the
deep
blue
vault
and
trembled
between
us
and
those
vast
fields
of
heaven
papillon
watched
their
reflection
in
the
river
or
looked
at
the
houses
along
the
shore
few
and
far
apart
where
a
solitary
candle
showed
here
and
there
fareham
came
and
seated
himself
near
us
but
talked
little
we
drew
our
cloaks
closer
for
the
air
was
cold
and
papillon
nestled
beside
me
and
dropped
asleep
even
the
dipping
of
the
oars
had
a
ghostly
sound
in
the
night
stillness
and
we
seemed
so
melancholy
in
this
silence
and
so
far
away
from
one

chapter
xiv
the
millbank
ghost
one
of
the
greatest
charms
of
london
has
ever
been
the
facility
of
getting
away
from
it
to
some
adjacent
rustic
or
spot
and
in
though
many
people
declared
that
the
city
had
outgrown
all
reason
and
was
eating
up
the
country
a
journey
would
carry
the
londoner
from
bricks
and
mortar
to
rusticity
and
while
the
tower
of
st
paul
cathedral
was
still
within
sight
he
might
lie
on
the
grass
on
a
wild
hillside
and
hear
the
skylark
warbling
in
the
blue
arch
above
him
and
scent
the
hawthorn
blowing
in
untrimmed
and
then
there
were
the
fashionable
resorts
the
gardens
or
the
fields
which
the
town
had
marked
as
its
own
beauty
and
wit
had
their
choice
of
such
between
westminster
and
barn
elms
where
in
the
remote
solitudes
along
the
river
murder
might
be
done
in
strict
accordance
with
etiquette
and
was
too
seldom
punished
by
law
among
the
rendezvous
of
fashion
there
was
one
retired
spot
less
widely
known
than
fox
hall
or
the
mulberry
garden
but
which
possessed
a
certain
repute
and
was
affected
rather
by
the
exclusives
than
by
the
crowd
it
was
a
dilapidated
building
of
immemorial
age
known
as
the
haunted
abbey
being
in
fact
the
refectory
of
a
cistercian
monastery
of
which
all
other
remains
had
disappeared
long
ago
the
abbey
had
flourished
in
the
lifetime
of
sir
thomas
more
and
was
mentioned
in
some
of
his
familiar
epistles
the
ruined
building
had
been
used
as
a
granary
in
the
time
of
charles
the
first
and
it
was
only
within
the
last
decade
that
it
had
been
redeemed
from
that
degraded
use
and
had
been
in
some
measure
restored
and
made
habitable
for
the
occupation
of
an
old
couple
who
owned
the
surrounding
fields
and
who
had
a
small
dairy
farm
from
which
they
sent
fresh
milk
into
london
every
morning
the
ghostly
repute
of
the
place
and
the
attraction
of
new
milk
cheese
cakes
and
syllabubs
had
drawn
a
certain
number
of
those
satiated
who
were
ever
on
the
alert
for
a
new
sensation
among
whom
there
was
none
more
active
or
more
noisy
than
lady
sarah
tewkesbury
she
had
made
the
haunted
abbey
in
a
manner
her
own
had
invited
her
friends
to
midnight
parties
to
watch
for
the
ghost
and
to
morning
parties
to
eat
syllabubs
and
dance
on
the
grass
she
had
brought
a
shower
of
gold
into
the
lap
of
the
miserly
freeholder
and
had
husband
and
wife
completely
under
her
thumb
doler
the
husband
had
fought
in
the
civil
war
and
doler
had
been
a
cook
in
the
fairfax
household
but
both
had
scrupulously
sunk
all
cromwellian
associations
since
his
majesty
return
and
in
boasting
as
he
often
did
boast
of
having
fought
desperately
and
been
left
for
dead
at
the
battle
of
brentford
doler
had
been
careful
to
suppress
the
fact
that
he
was
a
hireling
soldier
of
the
parliament
he
would
weep
for
the
martyred
king
and
tell
the
story
of
his
own
wounds
until
it
is
possible
he
had
forgotten
which
side
he
had
fought
for
in
remembering
his
personal
prowess
and
sufferings
so
far
there
had
been
disappointment
as
to
the
ghost
sounds
had
been
heard
of
a
most
satisfying
grimness
during
those
midnight
and
early
morning
watchings
rappings
and
scrapings
and
scratching
on
the
wall
groanings
and
meanings
sighings
and
whisperings
behind
the
wainscote
but
nothing
spectral
had
been
seen
and
doler
had
been
severely
reprimanded
by
her
patrons
and
patronesses
for
the
unwarrantable
conduct
of
a
spectre
which
she
professed
to
have
seen
as
often
as
she
had
fingers
and
toes
it
was
the
phantom
of
a
nun
a
woman
of
exceeding
beauty
but
white
as
the
linen
which
banded
her
cheek
and
brow
there
was
a
dark
story
of
violated
oaths
priestly
sin
and
the
sleepless
conscience
of
the
dead
who
could
not
rest
even
in
that
dreadful
grave
where
the
sinner
had
been
immured
alive
but
must
needs
haunt
the
footsteps
of
the
living
a
wandering
shade
some
there
were
who
disbelieved
in
the
traditions
of
that
living
grave
and
who
even
went
so
far
as
to
doubt
the
ghost
but
the
spectre
had
an
established
repute
of
more
than
a
century
was
firmly
believed
in
by
all
the
children
and
old
women
of
the
neighbourhood
and
had
been
written
about
by
students
of
the
unseen
one
of
lady
sarah
parties
took
place
at
full
moon
not
long
after
the
visit
to
deptford
and
lord
fareham
barge
was
again
employed
this
time
on
a
nocturnal
expedition
up
the
river
to
the
fields
near
the
haunted
abbey
to
carry
hyacinth
her
sister
de
malfort
lord
rochester
sir
ralph
masaroon
sir
denzil
warner
and
a
bevy
of
wits
and
beauties
beauties
who
had
some
of
them
been
carrying
on
the
and
trading
in
eyes
and
complexion
for
more
than
one
decade
and
who
loved
that
night
season
when
paint
might
be
laid
on
thicker
than
in
the
glare
of
day
the
barge
wore
a
much
more
festive
aspect
under
her
ladyship
management
than
when
used
by
his
lordship
for
a
daylight
voyage
like
the
trip
to
deptford
satin
coverlets
and
tapestry
curtains
had
been
brought
from
lady
fareham
own
apartments
to
be
flung
with
studied
carelessness
over
benches
and
tabourets
her
ladyship
and
musicians
were
grouped
picturesquely
under
a
silken
canopy
in
the
bows
and
a
row
of
lanterns
hung
on
chains
festooned
from
stem
to
stern
pretty
that
had
no
illuminating
power
under
that
moon
but
which
glittered
with
coloured
light
like
jewels
and
twinkled
and
trembled
in
the
summer
air
a
table
in
the
stern
was
spread
with
a
light
collation
which
gave
an
excuse
for
the
display
of
cups
silver
tankards
and
venetian
a
miniature
fountain
played
perfumed
waters
in
the
midst
of
this
splendour
and
it
amused
the
ladies
to
pull
off
their
long
gloves
dip
them
in
the
scented
water
and
flap
them
in
the
faces
of
their
beaux
the
distance
was
only
too
short
since
lady
fareham
friends
declared
the
voyage
was
by
far
the
pleasanter
part
of
the
entertainment
denzil
among
others
was
of
this
opinion
for
it
was
his
good
fortune
to
have
secured
the
seat
next
angela
and
to
be
able
to
interest
her
by
his
account
of
the
buildings
they
passed
whose
historical
associations
were
much
better
known
to
him
than
to
most
young
men
of
his
epoch
he
had
sat
at
the
feet
of
a
man
who
scoffed
at
pope
and
king
and
hated
episcopacy
but
who
revered
all
that
was
noble
and
excellent
in
england
past
flams
mere
flams
cried
hyacinth
acknowledging
the
praises
bestowed
on
her
barge
but
if
you
like
clary
wine
better
than
skimmed
milk
you
had
best
drink
a
brimmer
or
two
before
you
leave
the
barge
since
is
odds
you
get
nothing
but
syllabubs
and
gingerbread
from
lady
sarah
a
substantial
supper
might
frighten
away
the
ghost
who
doubtless
parted
with
sensual
propensities
when
she
died
said
de
malfort
how
do
we
watch
for
her
in
a
severe
silence
as
if
we
were
at
church
aw
would
keep
silence
for
a
week
o
sawbaths
gin
aw
was
sure
o
seeing
a
bogle
said
lady
euphemia
dubbin
a
scotch
marquess
daughter
who
had
married
a
wealthy
cit
and
made
it
the
chief
endeavour
of
her
life
to
ignore
her
husband
and
keep
him
at
a
distance
she
hated
the
man
only
a
little
less
than
his
plebeian
name
which
she
had
not
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
change
because
forsooth
there
had
been
dubbins
in
mark
lane
for
many
generations
all
previous
dubbins
had
lived
over
their
warehouses
and
offices
but
her
ladyship
had
brought
thomas
dubbin
from
mark
lane
to
my
lord
bedford
piazza
in
the
convent
garden
where
he
endured
the
tedium
of
existence
in
a
fine
new
house
in
which
he
was
afraid
of
his
fine
new
servants
and
never
had
anything
to
eat
that
he
liked
his
gastronomic
taste
being
for
dishes
the
very
names
of
which
were
intolerable
to
persons
of
quality
this
evening
dubbin
had
been
incorrigible
and
had
insisted
on
intruding
his
clumsy
person
upon
lady
fareham
party
arguing
with
a
dull
persistence
that
his
name
was
on
her
ladyship
billet
of
invitation
your
name
is
on
a
great
many
invitations
only
because
it
is
my
misfortune
to
be
called
by
it
his
wife
told
him
to
sit
on
a
barge
after
ten
at
night
in
june
the
coarsest
month
in
summer
is
to
court
lumbago
and
all
i
hope
is
ye
not
be
punished
by
a
worse
attack
than
common
dubbin
had
refused
to
be
discouraged
even
by
this
churlishness
from
his
lady
and
appeared
in
attendance
upon
her
wearing
a
magnificent
birthday
suit
of
crimson
velvet
and
green
brocade
which
he
meant
to
present
to
his
favourite
actor
at
the
duke
theatre
after
he
had
exhibited
himself
in
it
half
a
dozen
times
at
whitehall
for
the
benefit
of
the
great
world
and
at
the
mulberry
garden
for
the
admiration
of
the
he
was
a
fat
little
man
the
essence
of
good
nature
and
perfectly
unconscious
of
being
an
offence
to
fine
people
although
not
a
wit
himself
dubbin
was
occasionally
the
cause
of
wit
in
others
if
the
practice
of
bubbling
an
innocent
rustic
or
citizen
can
be
called

rochester

sir
ralph
masaroon
and
one
jerry
spavinger
a
gentleman
jockey
who
was
a
nobody
in
town
but
a
shining
light
at
newmarket
took
it
upon
themselves
to
draw
the
harmless
citizen
and
as
a
preliminary
to
making
him
ridiculous
essayed
to
make
him
drunk
they
were
clustered
together
in
a
little
group
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
company
and
were
attended
upon
by
a
lackey
who
brought
a
full
tankard
at
the
first
whistle
on
the
empty
one
and
whom
dubbin
after
a
rapid
succession
of
brimmers
insisted
on
calling
drawer
it
was
very
seldom
that
rochester
condescended
to
take
part
in
any
entertainment
on
which
the
royal
sun
shone
not
unless
it
were
some
marauding
with
buckhurst
sedley
and
a
band
of
wild
coursers
from
the
purlieus
of
drury
lane
he
could
see
no
pleasure
in
any
medium
between
whitehall
and
alsatia
if
i
am
not
fooling
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
let
me
sprawl
in
the
gutter
with
pamphleteers
and
said
this
precocious
profligate
i
abhor
a
reputable
party
among
your
petty
nobility
and
if
i
had
not
been
in
love
with
lady
fareham
off
and
on
ever
since
i
cut
my
second
teeth
i
would
have
no
hand
in
such
a
humdrum
business
as
this
there
not
a
neater
filly
in
the
london
stable
than
her
ladyship
said
jerry
and
i
do
blame
your
taste
i
was
her
yesterday
in
hi
park
but
she
did
seem
to
relish
the
manoeuvre
though
i
was
wearing
a
chedreux
peruke
that
ought
to
strike
dead
you
do
give
your
peruke
a
chance
jerry
while
you
frame
that
ugly
phiz
in
it
why
not
buffle
the
whole
company
my
lord
said
masaroon
while
dubbin
talked
apart
with
lady
euphemia
who
had
come
from
the
other
end
of
the
barge
to
warn
her
husband
against
excess
in
rhenish
or
burgundy
you
are
good
at
disguises
why
not
act
the
ghost
and
frighten
everybody
out
of
their
senses
il

de

ralph
the
creatures
have
no
sense
to
be
robbed
of
they
are
fashion
which
is
only
worked
by
machinery
they
imitate
us
as
monkeys
do
without
knowing
what
they
aim
at
their
women
have
virtuous
instincts
but
turn
wanton
rather
than
not
be
like
the
maids
of
honour
and
because
we
have
our
duels
their
men
murder
each
other
for
a
shrugged
shoulder
or
a
casual
word
no
i
not
chalk
my
face
or
smear
myself
with
phosphorus
to
amuse
such
trumpery
it
was
worth
my
pains
to
disguise
myself
as
a
german
nostradamus
in
order
to
fool
the
lovely
jennings
and
her
friend
price
who
wo
easily
forget
their
adventures
as
in
the
heart
of
the
city
but
i
have
done
with
all
such
follies
you
are
growing
old
wilmot
the
years
are
telling
upon
your
spirits
i
was
nineteen
last
birthday
and
is
fit
i
should
feel
the
burden
of
time
and
think
of
virtue
and
a
rich
wife
like
mallet
for
example
faith
a
man
might
do
worse
than
win
so
much
beauty
and
wealth
but
the
creature
is
arrogant
and
calls
me
and
half
the
peerage
is
after
her
but
we
have
our
jest
with
the
city
scrub
ralph
not
because
i
bear
him
malice
but
because
i
hate
his
wife
and
we
have
our
masquerading
some
time
after
midnight
if
you
can
borrow
a
little
finery
dubbin
was
released
from
his
lady
lecture
at
this
instant
and
lord
rochester
continued
his
communication
in
a
whisper
the
honourable
jeremiah
assenting
with
nods
and
chucklings
while
masaroon
whistled
for
a
fresh
tankard
and
plied
the
honest
merchant
with
a
glass
which
he
never
allowed
to
be
empty
the
taste
for
masquerading
was
a
fashion
of
the
time
as
much
as
combing
a
periwig
or
flirting
a
fan
while
rochester
was
planning
a
trick
upon
the
citizen
lady
fareham
was
whispering
to
de
malfort
under
cover
of
the
fiddles
which
were
playing
an
italian
pazzemano
an
air
beloved
by
henrietta
of
orleans
who
danced
to
that
music
with
her
royal
in
one
of
the
sumptuous
ballets
at
st
cloud
why
should
they
be
disappointed
of
their
ghost
said
hyacinth
when
it
would
be
so
easy
for
me
to
dress
up
as
the
nun
and
scare
them
all
this
white
satin
gown
of
mine
with
a
few
yards
of
white
lawn
arranged
on
my
head
and
shoulders
ah
but
you
have
not
the
lawn
at
hand
or
your
woman
to
arrange
your
head
interjected
de
malfort
quickly
it
would
be
a
capital
joke
but
it
must
be
for
another
occasion
and
choicer
company
the
rabble
you
have
is
not
worth
it
besides
there
is
rochester
who
is
in
disguises
and
would
smoke
you
at
a
glance
let
me
arrange
it
some
night
before
the
end
of
the
summer
when
there
is
a
waning
moon
it
were
a
pity
the
thing
were
done
will
you
really
plan
a
party
for
me
and
let
me
appear
to
them
on
the
stroke
of
one
with
my
face
whitened
i
have
as
slender
a
shape
as
most
women
there
is
no
such
sylph
in
london
and
i
can
make
myself
look
ethereal
will
you
draw
the
nun
habit
for
me
and
i
will
give
your
picture
to
lewin
to
copy
i
will
do
more
i
will
get
you
a
real
habit
but
there
are
no
nuns
so
white
as
the
ghost
true
but
you
may
rely
upon
me
the
nun
robes
shall
be
there
the
phosphorous
the
blue
fire
and
a
selection
of
the
choicest
company
to
tremble
at
you
leave
the
whole
business
to
my
care
it
will
amuse
me
to
plan
so
exquisite
a
jest
for
so
lovely
a
jester
he
bent
down
to
kiss
her
hand
till
his
forehead
almost
touched
her
knee
and
in
the
few
moments
that
passed
before
he
raised
it
she
heard
him
laughing
softly
to
himself
as
if
with
irrepressible
delight
what
a
child
you
are
she
said
to
be
pleased
with
such
folly
what
children
we
both
are
hyacinth
my
sweet
soul
let
us
always
be
childish
and
find
pleasure
in
follies
life
is
such
a
poor
thing
that
if
we
had
leisure
to
appraise
its
value
we
should
have
a
contagion
of
suicide
that
would
number
more
deaths
than
the
plague
indeed
the
wonder
is
not
that
any
man
should
commit
de
but
that
so
many
of
us
should
take
the
trouble
to
live
lady
sarah
received
them
at
the
with
an
escort
of
fops
and
fine
ladies
and
the
festival
promised
to
be
a
success
there
was
a
better
supper
and
more
wine
than
people
expected
from
her
ladyship
and
after
supper
a
good
many
of
those
who
pretended
to
have
come
to
see
the
ghost
wandered
off
in
couples
to
saunter
along
the
bank
while
only
the
more
earnest
spirits
were
content
to
wait
and
watch
and
listen
in
the
great
vaulted
hall
with
no
light
but
the
moon
which
sent
a
flood
of
silver
through
the
high
gothic
window
from
which
every
vestige
of
glass
had
long
vanished
there
were
stone
benches
along
the
two
side
walls
and
lady
had
secured
cushions
or
carpets
for
her
guests
to
sit
upon
and
here
the
superstitious
sat
in
patient
weariness
angela
among
them
with
denzil
still
at
her
side
scornful
of
credulous
folly
but
loving
to
be
with
her
he
adored
lady
fareham
had
been
tempted
by
de
malfort
to
look
at
the
moonlight
on
the
river
and
had
not
returned
rochester
and
his
crew
had
also
vanished
directly
after
supper
and
for
company
angela
had
on
her
left
hand
dubbin
far
advanced
in
liquor
and
trembling
at
every
breath
of
summer
wind
that
fluttered
the
ivy
round
the
ruined
window
and
at
every
shadow
that
moved
upon
the
moonlit
wall
his
wife
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
whispering
with
lady
sarah
and
both
so
deep
in
a
court
scandal
in
which
the
k
and
the
d
recurred
very
often
that
they
had
almost
forgotten
the
purpose
of
that
moonlight
sitting
suddenly
in
the
distance
there
sounded
a
long
shrill
wailing
as
of
a
soul
in
agony
whereupon
dubbin
after
clinging
wildly
to
angela
and
being
somewhat
roughly
flung
aside
by
denzil
collapsed
altogether
and
rolled
upon
the
ground
lady
euphemia
cried
townshend
a
young
lady
who
had
been
sitting
next
the
obnoxious
citizen
be
pleased
to
look
after
your
drunken
husband
if
you
take
the
sot
into
company
you
should
at
least
charge
yourself
with
the
care
of
his
manners
the
damsel
had
started
to
her
feet
and
indignantly
snatched
her
satin
petticoat
from
contact
with
the
citizen
porpoise
figure
i
hate
mixed
company
she
told
angela
and
old
maids
who
marry
if
a
woman
of
rank
marries
a
shopkeeper
she
ought
never
to
be
allowed
west
of
temple
bar
this
young
lady
was
no
believer
in
ghosts
but
others
of
the
company
were
too
scared
for
speech
all
had
risen
and
were
staring
in
the
direction
whence
that
dismal
shriek
had
come
a
trick
perhaps
since
anybody
with
strong
lungs
dairymaid
or
cowboy
could
shriek
they
all
wanted
to
something
a
real
manifestation
of
the
supernatural
the
unearthly
sound
was
repeated
and
the
next
moment
a
spectral
shape
in
flowing
white
garments
rushed
through
the
great
window
and
crossed
the
hall
followed
by
three
other
shapes
in
dark
loose
robes
with
hooded
heads
one
carried
a
rope
another
a
pickaxe
the
third
a
trowel
and
hod
of
mortar
they
crossed
the
hall
with
flying
footsteps
shadowlike
the
pale
shape
in
distracted
flight
the
dark
shapes
pursuing
and
came
to
a
stop
close
against
the
wall
which
had
been
vacated
by
the
scared
assembly
scattering
as
if
the
king
of
terrors
had
appeared
among
them
yet
with
fascinated
eyes
fixed
on
those
fearsome
figures
it
is
the
nun
herself
cried
lady
sarah
apprehension
and
triumph
contending
in
her
agitated
spirits
for
it
was
surely
a
feather
in
her
ladyship
cap
to
have
produced
such
a
phantasmal
train
at
her
party
the
nun
and
her
executioners
the
company
fell
back
from
the
ghostly
troop
recoiling
till
they
were
all
clustered
against
the
opposite
wall
leaving
a
clear
space
in
front
of
the
spectres
whence
they
looked
on
shuddering
at
the
tragedy
of
the
erring
sister
fate
repeated
in
dumb
show
the
figure
knelt
and
grovelled
at
the
feet
of
those
hooded
executioners
one
seized
and
bound
her
with
strange
automatic
action
unlike
the
movements
of
living
creatures
and
another
smote
the
wall
with
a
pickaxe
that
made
no
sound
while
the
third
waited
with
his
trowel
and
mortar
it
was
a
gruesome
sight
to
those
who
knew
the
story
a
gruesome
yet
an
enjoyable
spectacle
since
as
lady
sarah
friends
had
not
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
the
sinning
sister
in
the
flesh
they
watched
this
ghostly
representation
of
her
suffering
with
as
keen
an
interest
as
they
would
have
felt
had
they
been
privileged
to
see
claud
duval
swing
at
tyburn
the
person
most
terrified
by
this
ghostly
show
was
the
only
one
who
had
the
hardihood
to
tackle
the
performers
this
was
dubbin
who
sat
on
the
ground
watching
the
shadowy
figures
sobered
by
fear
and
his
shrewd
city
senses
gradually
returning
to
a
brain
bemused
by
burgundy
look
at
her
boots
he
cried
suddenly
scrambling
to
his
feet
and
pointing
to
the
nun
who
in
sprawling
and
writhing
at
the
feet
of
her
executioner
had
revealed
more
leg
and
foot
than
were
consistent
with
her
spectral
whiteness
she
wears
yaller
boots
as
substantial
as
any
shoe
leather
among
the
company
i
swear
to
them
yaller
boots
a
chorus
of
laughter
followed
this
attack
laughter
which
found
a
smothered
echo
among
the
ghosts
the
spell
was
broken
disillusion
followed
the
exquisite
thrill
of
fear
and
all
lady
sarah
male
visitors
made
a
rush
upon
the
guilty
nun
the
loose
white
robe
was
stripped
off
and
little
jerry
spavinger
gentleman
jock
famous
on
the
heath
and
at
doncaster
stood
revealed
in
his
shirt
and
breeches
and
those
light
which
he
rarely
exchanged
for
a
more
courtly

buffoonery
but
i
take
it
vastly
ill
on
your
part

to
join
in
making
me
a
remonstrated
lady
sarah
indeed
sister
you
have
to
thank
his
lordship
for
giving
a
spirited
end
to
your
assembly
could
you
conceive
how
preposterous
you
and
your
friends
looked
sitting
against
the
walls
mute
as
stockfish
and
suggesting
nothing
but
a
quaker
meeting
you
would
make
us
your
lowest
curtsy
and
thank
us
kindly
for
having
helped
you
out
of
a
dilemma
lady
sarah
who
was
too
much
of
a
woman
of
the
world
to
quarrel
seriously
with
a
court
favourite
furled
the
fan
with
which
she
had
been
cooling
her
indignation
and
tapped
young
wilmot
playfully
on
that
oval
cheek
where
the
beard
had
scarce
begun
to
grow
thou
art
the
most
incorrigible
wretch
of
thy
years
in
london
she
said
and
it
is
impossible
to
help
being
angry
with
thee
or
to
help
forgiving
thee
the
saunterers
on
the
banks
came
strolling
in
lady
fareham
cornets
and
fiddles
sounded
a
march
in
alceste
and
the
party
broke
up
in
laughter
and
good
temper
dubbin
being
much
complimented
upon
his
having
detected
spavinger
boots
i
ought
to
know
he
answered
ruefully
i
lost
a
hundred
meggs
on
him
toosday
at

i
had
time
to
take
the

has
your

any
commands
for
paris
lord
fareham
asked
one
august
afternoon
when
the
ghost
party
at
millbank
was
almost
forgotten
amid
a
succession
of
entertainments
on
land
and
river
a
fortnight
at
epsom
to
drink
the
waters
and
a
fortnight
at
tunbridge
where
the
queen
and
court
were
spending
the
close
of
summer
to
neutralise
the
bad
effects
of
epsom
chalybeates
with
a
regimen
of
kentish
sulphur
if
nobody
at
either
resort
drank
deeper
of
the
medicinal
springs
than
hyacinth
who
had
ordered
her
physician
to
order
her
that
treatment
the
risk
of
harm
or
the
possibility
of
benefit
was
of
the
smallest
but
at
epsom
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
gay
company
and
a
greater
liberty
of
manners
than
in
london
for
indeed
as
rochester
assured
lady
fareham
the
freedom
of
epsom
allowed
almost
nothing
to
be
scandalous
and
at
tunbridge
there
were
dances
by
torchlight
on
the
common
and
at
the
worst
lady
fareham
told
her
friends
a
fortnight
or
so
at
the
wells
helps
to
shorten
the
summer
it
was
the
middle
of
august
when
they
went
back
to
fareham
house
hot
dry
weather
and
london
seemed
to
be
living
on
the
thames
so
thick
was
the
throng
of
boats
going
up
and
down
the
river
so
that
with
an
afternoon
tide
running
up
it
seemed
as
if
barges
luggers
and
wherries
were
moving
in
one
solid
block
into
the
sunset
sky
de
malfort
had
been
attached
to
her
ladyship
party
at
epsom
and
at
tunbridge
wells
he
had
his
own
lodgings
but
seldom
occupied
them
except
in
that
period
between
four
or
five
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
afternoon
which
rochester
and
he
called
night
his
days
were
passed
chiefly
in
attendance
upon
lady
fareham
singing
and
playing
fetching
and
carrying
combing
her
favourite
spaniel
with
the
same
ivory
that
arranged
his
own
waterfall
curls
or
reading
a
french
romance
to
her
or
teaching
her
the
newest
game
of
cards
or
the
last
imported
from
fontainebleau
or
st
cloud
or
some
new
grace
or
fashion
in
dancing
the
holding
of
the
hand
lower
or
higher
the
latest
manner
of
passaging
in
a
bransle
or
a
coranto
as
performed
by
the
french
king
and
madame
henriette
the
two
finest
dancers
in

cond√©
once
so
famous
for
his
dancing
now
appearing
in
those
gay
scenes
but
seldom
have
you
any
commands
for
paris
hyacinth
repeated
lord
fareham
his
wife
being
for
the
moment
too
surprised
to
answer
him
or
have
you
sister
i
am
starting
for
france
i
shall
ride
to
dover
lying
a
night
at
sittingbourne
perhaps
and
cross
by
the
packet
that
goes
twice
a
week
to
calais
paris
and
pray
my
lord
what
business
takes
you
to
paris
there
is
a
great
collection
of
books
to
be
sold
there
next
week
the
library
of
your
old
admirer
nicolas
fouquet
whom
you
knew
in
his
splendour
but
who
has
been
a
prisoner
at
pignerol
for
a
year
and
a
half
poor
wretch
cried
de
malfort
i
was
at
the
chamber
with
madame
de
s√©vign√©
very
often
during
his
long
tedious
trial
mon
dieu
what
courage
what
talent
he
showed
in
defending
himself
every
safeguard
of
the
law
was
violated
in
order
to
silence
him
and
prove
him
guilty
his
papers
seized
in
his
absence
no
friend
or
servant
allowed
to
protect
his
interest
no
inventory
taken
documents
suppressed
that
might
have
served
for
his
defence
forgeries
inserted
by
his
foes
he
had
an
implacable
enemy
and
he
the
highest
in
the
land
he
was
the
scapegoat
of
the
past
and
had
to
answer
for
a
system
of
plunder
that
made
mazarin
the
richest
man
in
france
i
do
wonder
that
louis
was
angry
with
a
servant
who
had
the
insolence
to
entertain
his
majesty
with
a
splendour
that
surpassed
his
own
said
lady
fareham
i
should
like
to
have
been
at
those
f√™tes
at
vaux
but
although
fareham
talks
so
lightly
of
travelling
to
paris
to
choose
a
few
dusty
books
he
has
always
discouraged
me
from
going
there
to
see
old
friends
and
my
own
house
which
i
grieve
to
think
of
abandoned
to
the
carelessness
of
servants
dearest
the
cleverest
woman
in
the
world
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
ever
had
your
days
here
so
full
of
agreeable
engagements
that
you
can
have
scarcely
desired
to
leave
london
answered
fareham
with
his
grave
smile
to
leave
london
no
but
there
have
been
long
moping
months
in
oxfordshire
when
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
change
the
scene
then
indeed
had
you
been
very
earnest
in
wanting
such
a
change
i
am
sure
you
would
have
taken
it
i
have
never
forbidden
your
going
to
paris
nor
refused
to
accompany
you
there
you
may
go
with
me
if
you
can
be
ready
which
you
know
i
can
not
or
you
would
scarce
make
so
liberal
an
offer
tr√®s
ch√®re
you
are
pleased
to
be
petulant
but
i
repeat
my
question
is
there
anything
you
want
at
paris
anything
a
million
things
everything
but
they
are
things
which
you
would
not
be
able
to
choose
except
perhaps
some
of
the
new
lace
i
might
trust
you
to
buy
that
though
i
wager
you
will
bring
me
a
hideous
pattern
and
some
white
cypress
powder
and
a
piece
of
the
velvet
madame
wore
last
winter
i
have
friends
who
can
choose
for
you
if
i
write
to
them
and
you
will
have
but
to
bring
the
goods
and
see
they
suffer
no
harm
on
the
voyage
and
you
can
go
to
the
rue
de
tourain
and
see
whether
my
servants
are
keeping
the
house
in
tolerable
order
with
your
ladyship
permission
i
will
lodge
there
while
i
am
in
paris
which
will
be
but
long
enough
to
attend
the
sale
of
books
and
see
some
old
friends
if
i
am
detained
it
will
be
by
finding
my
friends
out
of
town
and
having
to
make
a
journey
to
see
them
i
shall
not
go
beyond
fontainebleau
at
furthest
dear
fontainebleau
it
is
of
all
french
palaces
my
favourite
i
always
envy
diana
of
poitiers
for
having
her
cypher
emblazoned
all
over
that
lovely
gallery
henri
and
diane
diane
and
henri
ah
me
you
envy
her
a
kind
of
notoriety
which
i
do
not
covet
for
my
wife
you
always
take
one
au
pied
de
la
lettre
but
seriously
madame
de
br√©z√©
was
an
honest
woman
compared
with
the
lady
who
lodges
by
the
holbein
gate
i
admit
that
sin
wears
a
bolder
front
than
it
did
in
the
last
century
angela
can
i
find
nothing
for
you
in
paris
no
i
thank
your
lordship
you
and
sister
are
both
so
generous
to
me
that
i
have
lost
the
capacity
to
wish
for
anything
and
as
lewin
crosses
the
channel
three
or
four
times
a
year
i
doubt
we
positively
have
the
paris
fashions
as
soon
as
the
parisians
themselves
added
hyacinth
that
is
an
agreeable
hallucination
with
which
englishwomen
have
ever
consoled
themselves
for
not
being
french
said
de
malfort
who
sat
lolling
against
the
marble
balustrade
nursing
the
guitar
on
which
he
had
been
playing
when
fareham
interrupted
their
noontide
idleness
but
your
ladyship
may
be
sure
that
london
milliners
are
ever
a
twelvemonth
in
the
rear
of
paris
fashions
it
is
not
that
they
do
not
see
the
new
mode
they
see
it
and
think
it
hideous
and
it
takes
a
year
to
teach
them
that
it
is
the
one
perfect
style
possible
i
was
not
thinking
of
kerchiefs
or
petticoats
said
fareham
you
are
a
sister
like
myself
can
i
bring
you
no
books
you
wish
for
if
there
were
a
new
comedy
by
moli√®re
but
i
fear
it
is
wrong
to
read
him
since
in
his
late
play
performed
before
the
king
at
versailles
he
is
so
cruel
an
enemy
to
our
church
a
foe
only
to
hypocrites
and
pretenders
angela
i
will
bring
you
his
if
it
is
printed
or
still
better
which
i
am
told
is
the
finest
comedy
that
was
ever
written
and
the
latest
romance
in
twenty
volumes
or
so
by
one
of
those
lady
authors
hyacinth
so
admires
but
which
i
own
to
finding
as
tedious
as
the
divine
orinda
verses
you
can
jeer
at
that
poor
lady
poetry
yet
take
pleasure
in
such
balderdash
as
hudibras
i
love
wit
dearest
though
i
am
not
witty
but
as
for
your
princesse
de
cleves
i
find
her
ineffably
dull
that
is
because
you
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
discover
for
whom
the
characters
are
meant
you
lack
the
key
to
the
imbroglio
said
his
wife
with
a
superior
air
i
do
not
care
for
a
book
that
is
a
series
of
enigmas
don
quixote
needs
no
such
shakespeare
characters
are
painted
not
from
the
petty
models
of
yesterday
and
but
from
mankind
in
every
age
and
every
climate
moli√®re
and
calderon
personages
stand
on
as
solid
a
basis
in
less
than
half
a
century
your
cyrus
will
be
insufferable
jargon
not
more
so
than
your
or
shakespeare
was
but
kept
in
fashion
during
the
late
king
reign
because
his
majesty
loved
him
and
will
soon
be
forgotten
now
that
we
have
so
many
gayer
and
brisker
dramatists
whoever
quotes
shakespeare
nowadays
asked
lady
sarah
tewkesbury
who
had
been
showing
a
rustic
niece
the
beauties
of
the
river
as
seen
from
fareham
house
even
taylor
whose
sermons
bristle
with
elegant
allusions
never
points
one
of
his
passionate
climaxes
with
a
shakespearian
line
and
yet
there
are
some
very
fine
lines
in
and
which
would
scarce
sound
amiss
from
the
pulpit
added
her
ladyship
condescendingly
i
have
read
all
the
plays
some
of
them
twice
over
and
i
doubt
that
though
shakespeare
can
not
hold
the
stage
in
our
more
enlightened
age
and
will
be
less
and
less
acted
as
the
town
grows
more
refined
his
works
will
always
be
tasted
by
scholars
among
whom
in
my
modest
way
i
dare
reckon
myself
lord
fareham
left
london
on
horseback
with
but
one
servant
in
the
early
august
dawn
before
the
rest
of
the
household
were
stirring
hyacinth
lay
nearly
as
late
of
a
morning
as
henrietta
maria
whom
charles
used
sometimes
to
reproach
for
not
being
up
in
time
for
the
noonday
office
at
her
own
chapel
lady
fareham
had
not
portuguese
catherine
fervour
who
was
often
at
mass
at
seven
but
she
did
usually
contrive
to
be
present
at
high
mass
at
the
queen
chapel
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
her
day
by
that
time
angela
and
her
niece
and
nephew
had
spent
hours
on
the
river
or
in
the
meadows
at
chiswick
or
on
putney
heath
ever
glad
to
escape
from
the
great
overgrown
city
which
was
now
licking
up
every
stretch
of
green
sward
and
every
flowery
hedgerow
west
of
james
street
soon
there
would
be
no
country
between
the
haymarket
and
the
pillars
of
hercules
denzil
sometimes
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
accompanying
angela
children
and
on
these
rural
expeditions
by
the
great
waterway
and
on
such
occasions
he
and
angela
would
each
take
an
oar
and
row
the
boat
for
some
part
of
the
voyage
while
the
watermen
rested
and
in
this
manner
angela
instructed
by
sir
denzil
considerably
advanced
her
power
as
an
oarswoman
it
was
an
exercise
she
loved
as
indeed
she
loved
all
exercises
from
riding
with
hawks
and
hounds
to
battledore
and
shuttlecock
but
most
of
all
perhaps
she
loved
the
river
and
the
rhythmical
dip
of
oars
in
the
fresh
morning
air
when
every
curve
of
the
fertile
shores
seemed
to
reveal
new
beauty
it
had
been
a
hot
dry
summer
and
the
grass
in
the
parks
was
burnt
to
a
dull
brown
had
indeed
almost
ceased
to
be
grass
while
the
atmosphere
in
town
had
a
fiery
taste
and
was
heavy
with
the
dust
which
whitened
all
the
roadways
and
which
the
faintest
breath
of
wind
dispersed
here
on
the
flowing
tide
there
was
coolness
and
the
long
rank
grass
upon
those
low
sedgy
shores
was
still
green
lady
fareham
supported
the
august
heats
sitting
on
her
terrace
with
a
cluster
of
friends
about
her
and
her
musicians
and
grouped
in
the
distance
ready
to
perform
at
her
bidding
but
henriette
and
her
brother
soon
tired
of
that
luxurious
repose
and
would
urge
their
aunt
to
assist
in
a
river
expedition
the
was
fat
and
lazy
and
had
attended
upon
henriette
from
babyhood
and
always
did
as
she
was
told
her
ladyship
says
i
must
have
some
clever
person
instead
of
priscilla
before
i
am
a
year
older
henriette
told
her
aunt
but
i
have
promised
poor
old
prissy
to
hate
the
new
person
consumedly
angela
and
denzil
laughed
as
they
rowed
past
the
ruined
abbey
seen
dimly
across
the
low
where
cows
of
the
same
colour
were
all
lying
in
the
same
attitude
chewing
the
cud
i
think
spavinger
trick
must
have
cured
your
sister
fine
friends
of
all
belief
in
ghosts
he
said
i
doubt
they
would
be
as
ready
to
believe
or
to
pretend
to
believe
answered
angela
they
think
of
nothing
from
morning
till
night
but
how
to
amuse
themselves
and
when
every
pleasure
has
been
exhausted
i
suppose
fear
comes
in
as
a
form
of
entertainment
and
they
want
the
shock
of
seeing
a
ghost
there
have
been
no
more
midnight
parties
since
lady
sarah
assembly
i
think
not
among
people
of
quality
perhaps
but
there
have
been
parties
i
heard
monsieur
de
malfort
telling
my
sister
about
a
supper
given
by
a
wealthy
lady
from
aldersgate
the
city
people
copy
everything
that
their
superiors
wear
or
do
even
to
their
morals
said
denzil
happy
if
the
superiors
would
remember
that
and
upon
what
a
fertile
ground
they
sow
the
seed
of
new
vices
it
is
like
the
importation
of
a
new
weed
or
a
new
insect
which
beginning
with
an
accident
may
end
in
ruined
crops
and
a
country
famine
without
deliberate
disobedience
to
her
husband
lady
fareham
made
the
best
use
of
her
time
during
his
absence
in
paris
the
public
theatres
had
not
yet
after
the
horror
of
the
plague
whitehall
was
a
desert
the
king
and
his
chief
following
being
at
tunbridge
it
was
the
dullest
season
of
the
year
and
the
recrudescence
of
the
contagion
in
the
towns
along
the
thames
deptford
greenwich
and
the
neighbourhood
together
with
some
isolated
cases
in
london
made
people
more
serious
than
usual
despite
of
the
victory
over
the
dutch
which
although
a
mixed
benefit
was
celebrated
piously
by
a
day
of
general
thanksgiving
hyacinth
disgusted
at
the
dulness
of
the
town
was
for
ordering
her
coaches
and
retiring
to
chilton
it
is
mortal
dull
at
the
abbey
she
said
but
at
least
we
have
the
hawks
and
breezy
hills
to
ride
over
instead
of
this
sickly
city
atmosphere
which
to
my
nostrils
smells
of
the
pestilence
henri
de
malfort
argued
against
such
a
retreat
it
were
a
deliberate
suicide
he
said
london
when
everybody
has
left
all
the
bodies
we
count
worthy
to
live
is
a
more
delightful
place
than
you
can
imagine
there
are
a
host
of
vulgar
amusements
which
you
would
not
dare
to
visit
when
your
friends
are
in
town
and
which
are
ten
times
as
amusing
as
the
pleasures
you
know
by
heart
have
you
ever
been
to
the
bear
garden
i
warrant
you
no
though
is
but
across
the
river
at
bankside
we
go
there
this
afternoon
if
you
like
and
see
how
the
common
people
taste
life
then
there
are
the
gardens
at
islington
there
are
mountebanks
and
palmists
and
who
will
frighten
you
out
of
your
wits
for
a
shilling
there
a
man
at
clerkenwell
a
jeweller
journeyman
from
venice
who
pretends
to
practise
the
transmutation
of
metals
and
to
make
gold
he
squeezed
hundreds
out
of
that
old
miser
denham
who
was
afraid
to
have
the
law
of
him
for
imposture
lest
all
london
should
laugh
at
his
own
credulity
and
applaud
the
cheat
and
you
have
not
seen
the
italian
which
is
vastly
entertaining
i
could
find
you
novelty
and
amusement
for
a
month
find
anything
new
even
if
it
fail
to
amuse
me
i
am
sick
of
everything
i
know
and
then
there
is
our
midnight
party
at
millbank
the
at
which
you
are
to
frighten
your
dearest
friends
out
of
their
poor
little
wits
most
of
my
dearest
friends
are
in
the
country
nay
there
is
lady
lucretia
topham
whom
i
know
you
hate
and
lady
sarah
and
the
dubbins
are
still
in
covent
garden
i
will
have
no
dubbin
a
toping
wretch
and
she
is
a
too
incongruous
mixture
with
her
edinburgh
lingo
and
her
whitehall
arrogance
besides
the
whole
notion
of
a
mock
ghost
was
vulgarised
by
wilmot
foolery
who
ought
to
have
been
born
a
saltimbanque
and
spent
his
life
in
a
fair
no
i
have
abandoned
the
scheme
what
after
i
have
been
taxing
my
invention
to
produce
the
most
terrible
illusion
that
was
ever
witnessed
will
you
let
a
clown
like
spavinger
a
baulk
us
of
our
triumph
i
am
sending
to
paris
for
a
powder
to
burn
in
a
corner
of
the
room
which
will
throw
the
ghastliest
pallor
upon
your
countenance
when
i
devise
a
ghost
it
shall
be
no
impromptu
spectre
in
yellow
but
a
vision
so
awful
so
true
an
image
of
a
being
returned
from
the
dead
that
the
stoutest
nerves
will
thrill
and
tremble
at
the
apparition
the
nun
habit
is
coming
from
paris
i
have
asked
my
cousin
madame
de
fiesque
to
obtain
it
for
me
at
the
carmelites
you
are
taking
a
vast
deal
of
trouble
but
what
kind
of
assembly
can
we
muster
at
this
dead
season
leave
all
in
my
hands
i
will
find
you
some
of
the
choicest
spirits
it
is
to
be
party
i
will
not
even
tell
you
what
night
i
fix
upon
till
all
is
ready
so
make
no
engagements
for
your
evenings
and
tell
nobody
anything
who
invented
that
powder
a
french
chemist
he
has
it
of
all
colours
and
can
flood
a
scene
in
golden
light
or
the
rose
of
dawn
or
the
crimson
of
sunset
or
a
pale
silvery
blueness
that
you
would
swear
was
moonshine
it
has
been
used
in
all
the
court
ballets
i
saw
madame
once
look
as
ghastly
as
death
itself
and
all
the
court
was
seized
with
terror
some
blundering
fool
had
burnt
the
wrong
powder
which
cast
a
greenish
tint
over
the
faces
and
henriette
long
thin
features
had
a
look
of
death
it
seemed
the
forecast
of
an
early
grave
and
some
of
us
shuddered
as
at
a
prophecy
of
evil
you
might
expect
the
worst
in
her
case
knowing
the
wretched
life
she
leads
with
monsieur
yes
when
she
is
with
him
but
that
is
not
always
there
are
compensations
if
you
mean
scandal
i
will
not
hear
a
word
she
is
adorable
the
most
sympathetic
person
i
know
good
even
to
her
enemies
who
are
legion
you
had
better
not
say
that
for
i
doubt
she
has
only
one
kind
of
enemy
as
how
the
admirers
she
has
encouraged
and
disappointed
yes
she
is
adorable
wofully
thin
and
i
fear
consumptive
but
royal
and
adorable
et
lumi√®re
as
bossuet
calls
her
but
to
return
to
my
if
you
were
wise
you
would
abandon
the
notion
i
doubt
that
in
spite
of
your
powders
your
friends
will
never
believe
in
a
ghost
oh
yes
they
will
it
shall
be
my
business
to
get
them
in
the
proper
temper
that
idea
of
figuring
in
a
picturesque
habit
and
in
a
halo
of
churchyard
light
was
irresistible
hyacinth
promised
to
conform
to
malfort
plans
and
to
be
ready
to
assume
her
phantom
whenever
she
was
called
upon
angela
knew
something
of
the
scheme
and
that
there
was
to
be
another
assembly
at
millbank
but
her
sister
had
seemed
disinclined
to
talk
of
the
plan
in
her
presence
a
curious
reticence
in
one
whose
sentiments
and
caprices
were
usually
given
to
the
world
at
large
with
perfect
freedom
for
once
in
her
life
hyacinth
had
a
secret
air
and
checked
herself
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
her
light
babble
at
a
look
from
de
malfort
who
had
urged
her
to
keep
her
sister
out
of
their
midnight
party
i
pledge
my
honour
that
there
shall
be
nothing
to
offend
he
told
her
but
i
hope
to
have
the
wittiest
coxcombs
in
london
and
we
want
no
prudes
to
strangle
every
jest
with
a
lip
and
an
alarmed
eye
your
sister
has
a
pale
fragile
prettiness
which
pleases
an
eye
satiated
with
the
exuberant
charms
of
your
rubens
and
titian
women
but
she
is
not
handsome
enough
to
give
herself
airs
and
she
is
a
little
inclined
that
way
by
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
i
have
suffered
scowls
from
her
that
i
would
scarce
have
endured
from
barbara
barbara
you
are
vastly
free
with
her
ladyship
name
not
freer
than
she
has
ever
been
with
her
friendship
henri
if
i
thought
what
dearest
that
you
had
ever
cared
for
that
wanton
could
you
think
it
when
you
know
my
life
in
england
has
been
one
long
tragedy
of
loving
in
vain
of
sighing
only
to
be
denied
of
secret
tears
and
public
submission
do
not
talk
so
she
exclaimed
starting
up
from
her
low
tabouret
and
moving
hastily
to
the
open
window
to
fresh
air
and
sunshine
rippling
river
and
blue
sky
escaping
from
an
atmosphere
that
had
become
feverish
de
malfort
you
know
i
must
not
listen
to
foolish
raptures
i
know
you
have
been
refusing
to
hear
for
the
last
two
years
they
were
on
the
terrace
now
she
leaning
on
the
broad
marble
balustrade
he
standing
beside
her
and
all
the
traffic
of
london
moving
with
the
tide
below
them
to
return
to
our
party
she
said
in
a
lighter
tone
for
that
spurt
of
jealousy
had
betrayed
her
into
seriousness
it
will
be
very
awkward
not
to
invite
my
sister
to
go
with
me
if
you
did
she
would
refuse
belike
for
she
is
under
fareham
thumb
and
he
disapproves
of
everything
human
under
fareham
thumb
what
nonsense
indeed
i
must
invite
her
she
would
think
it
so
strange
to
be
omitted
not
if
you
manage
things
cleverly
the
party
is
to
be
a
surprise
you
can
tell
her
next
morning
you
knew
nothing
about
it
beforehand
but
she
will
hear
me
order
the
barge
or
will
see
me
start
there
will
be
no
barge
i
shall
carry
you
to
millbank
in
my
coach
after
your
evening
entertainment
wherever
that
may
be
i
had
better
take
my
own
carriage
at
least
or
my
chair
you
can
have
a
chair
if
you
are
too
prudish
to
use
my
coach
but
it
shall
be
got
for
you
at
the
moment
we
wo
have
your
own
chairman
and
links
to
chatter
and
betray
you
before
you
have
played
the
ghost
remember
you
come
to
my
party
not
as
a
guest
but
as
a
performer
if
they
ask
why
lady
fareham
is
absent
i
shall
say
you
refused
to
take
part
in
our
foolery
oh
you
must
invent
some
better
excuse
they
will
never
believe
anything
rational
of
me
say
i
was
disappointed
of
a
hat
or
a
mantua
well
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
angela
is
apt
to
be
tiresome
i
hate
a
disapproving
carriage
especially
in
a
younger
sister
angela
was
puzzled
by
hyacinth
demeanour
a
want
of
frankness
in
one
so
frank
by
nature
aroused
her
fears
she
was
puzzled
and
anxious
and
longed
for
fareham
return
lest
his
wife
should
be
guilty
of
some
innocent
indiscretion
that
might
vex
him
oh
if
she
but
valued
him
at
his
just
worth
she
would
value
his
opinion
second
only
to
the
approval
of
conscience
she
thought
sadly
ever
regretful
of
her
sister
too
obvious
indifference
towards
so
kind
a
husband
chapter
xvi
which
was
the
fiercer
fire
it
was
saturday
the
first
of
september
and
the
hot
dry
weather
having
continued
with
but
trifling
changes
throughout
the
month
the
atmosphere
was
at
its
sultriest
and
the
burnt
grass
in
the
parks
looked
as
if
even
the
dews
of
morning
and
evening
had
ceased
to
moisten
it
while
the
arid
and
dusty
foliage
gave
no
feeling
of
coolness
and
the
very
shadows
cast
upon
that
parched
ground
seemed
hot
morning
was
sultry
as
noon
evening
brought
but
little
refreshment
while
the
night
was
hotter
than
the
day
people
complained
that
the
season
was
even
more
sickly
than
in
the
plague
year
and
prophesied
a
new
and
worse
outbreak
of
the
pestilence
was
not
this
the
fatal
year
about
which
there
had
been
darkest
prophecies
something
awful
something
tragical
was
to
make
this
triplicate
of
sixes
for
ever
memorable
had
been
terrible
was
to
bring
a
greater
horror
doubtless
a
recrudescence
of
that
dire
malady
which
had
desolated
london
and
this
time
says
one
modish
raven
be
the
quality
that
will
suffer
the
lower
has
paid
its
penalty
and
only
the
strong
and
hardy
are
left
we
have
plenty
of
weaklings
and
corrupt
constitutions
that
will
take
fire
at
a
spark
i
should
not
wonder
were
the
contagion
to
rage
worst
at
whitehall
the
buildings
lie
low
and
there
is
ever
a
nucleus
of
fever
somewhere
in
that
conglomeration
of
bakeries
kitchens
stables
and
lodgings
one
gets
but
casual
whiffs
from
their
private
butcheries
and
bakeries
says
another
what
i
complain
of
is
the
atmosphere
of
his
apartments
where
one
can
scarce
breathe
for
the
stench
of
those
cursed
spaniels
he
so
delights
in
every
one
agreed
that
the
long
dry
summer
menaced
some
catastrophic
change
which
should
surprise
this
age
as
the
plague
had
done
last
year
but
oh
how
lightly
that
widespread
calamity
had
touched
those
light
minds
and
if
providence
had
designed
to
warn
or
to
punish
how
vain
had
been
the
warning
and
how
soon
forgotten
the
penalty
that
had
left
the
worst
offenders
unstricken
there
was
to
be
a
play
at
whitehall
that
evening
his
majesty
and
the
court
having
returned
from
tunbridge
wells
the
business
of
the
navy
calling
charles
to
council
with
his
faithful
general
general
george
monk
duke
of
albemarle
and
his
lord
high
admiral
and
brother
the
duke
even
in
briefest
residence
and
on
sternest
business
intent
with
the
welfare
and
honour
of
the
nation
contingent
on
their
consultations
to
build
or
not
to
build
warships
of
the
first
magnitude
the
ball
of
pleasure
must
be
kept
rolling
so
killigrew
was
to
produce
a
new
version
of
an
old
comedy
written
in
the
forties
but
now
polished
up
to
the
modern
style
of
wit
this
play
parson
was
said
to
be
all
froth
and
sparkle
and
current
interest
fresh
as
the
last
and
spiced
with
allusions
to
the
late
sickness
an
admirable
subject
and
allowing
a
wide
field
for
the
ridiculous
hyacinth
was
to
be
present
at
this
court
function
but
not
a
word
was
to
be
said
to
angela
about
the
entertainment
she
would
only
preach
me
a
sermon
upon
fareham
tastes
and
wishes
and
urge
me
to
stay
away
because
he
abhors
a
fashionable
comedy
she
told
de
malfort
i
shall
say
i
am
going
to
lady
sarah
to
play
basset
ange
hates
cards
and
will
not
desire
to
go
with
me
she
is
always
happy
with
the
children
who
adore
her
faute
de
mieux
you
are
so
ready
to
jeer
yes
i
know
i
am
a
neglectful
mother
but
what
would
you
have
i
would
have
you
as
you
are
he
answered
and
only
as
you
are
or
for
choice
a
trifle
worse
than
you
are
and
so
much
nearer
my
own
level
oh
i
know
you
it
is
the
wicked
women
you
admire
like
madame
palmer
always
harping
upon
barbara
mother
had
a
maid
called
barbara
his
majesty
has
a
lady
of
the
same
melodious
name
well
i
have
a
world
of
engagements
between
now
and
nine
when
the
play
begins
i
shall
be
at
the
door
to
lift
you
out
of
your
chair
cover
yourself
with
your
richest
jewels
or
at
least
those
you
love
best
so
that
you
may
blaze
like
the
sun
when
you
cast
off
the
nun
habit
all
the
town
will
be
there
to
admire
you
all
the
town
why
there
is
no
one
in
london
indeed
you
mistake
travelling
is
so
easy
nowadays
people
tear
to
and
fro
between
tunbridge
and
st
james
as
often
as
they
once
circulated
betwixt
london
and
chelsea
were
it
not
for
the
highwaymen
we
should
be
always
on
the
road
angela
and
her
niece
were
on
the
terrace
in
the
evening
coolness
the
atmosphere
was
less
oppressive
here
by
the
flowing
tide
than
anywhere
else
in
london
but
even
here
there
was
a
heaviness
in
the
night
air
and
henriette
sprawled
her
long
thin
legs
wearily
on
the
cushioned
bench
where
she
lay
and
vowed
that
it
would
be
sheer
folly
for
priscilla
to
insist
upon
her
going
to
bed
at
her
usual
hour
of
nine
when
everybody
knew
she
could
not
sleep
i
scarce
closed
my
eyes
last
night
she
protested
and
i
had
half
a
mind
to
put
on
a
petticoat
and
come
down
to
the
terrace
i
could
have
come
through
the
yellow
where
the
men
usually
forget
to
close
the
shutters
and
i
should
have
brought
my
theorbo
and
serenaded
you
should
you
have
taken
me
for
a
fairy
ch√®re
if
you
had
heard
me
singing
i
should
have
taken
you
for
a
very
silly
little
person
who
wanted
to
frighten
her
friends
by
catching
an
inflammation
of
the
lungs
well
you
see
i
thought
better
of
it
though
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
catch
cold
on
such
a
stifling
night
i
heard
every
clock
strike
in
westminster
and
london
it
was
light
at
five
yet
the
night
seemed
endless
i
would
have
welcomed
even
a
mouse
behind
the
wainscot
priscilla
is
an
odious
tyrant
making
a
face
at
the
gouvernante
sitting
by
she
wo
let
me
have
my
dogs
in
my
room
at
night
your
ladyship
knows
that
dogs
in
a
are
unwholesome
said
priscilla
no
you
foolish
old
thing
my
ladyship
knows
the
contrary
for
his
majesty
swarms
with
them
and
he
has
them
on
his
bed
even
whole
families
mothers
and
their
puppies
why
ca
i
have
a
few
dear
little
mischievous
innocents
to
amuse
me
in
the
long
dreary
nights
by
dint
of
clamour
and
expostulation
the
honourable
henriette
contrived
to
stay
up
till
ten
was
belled
with
solemn
tone
from
cathedral
which
magnificent
church
was
speedily
to
be
put
in
hand
for
restoration
at
a
great
expenditure
the
wooden
scaffolding
which
had
been
necessary
for
a
careful
examination
of
the
building
was
still
up
until
the
striking
of
the
great
city
clock
papillon
had
resolutely
disputed
the
lateness
of
the
hour
putting
forward
her
own
timekeeper
as
infallible
a
little
fat
round
purple
enamel
watch
with
diamond
figures
and
gold
hands
much
bent
from
being
pushed
backwards
and
forwards
to
bring
recorded
time
into
unison
with
the
young
lady
desires
a
watch
to
which
no
sensible
person
could
give
the
slightest
credit
the
clocks
of
london
having
demonstrated
the
futility
of
any
reference
to
that
geneva
toy
she
consented
to
retire
but
was
reluctant
to
the
last
i
am
going
to
bed
she
told
her
aunt
because
this
absurd
old
prissy
insists
upon
it
but
i
do
expect
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sleep
between
now
and
morning
and
most
of
the
time
i
shall
be
looking
out
of
the
window
watching
for
the
turn
of
the
tide
to
see
the
barges
and
boats
swinging
round
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
henriette
for
i
shall
sit
in
your
room
till
you
are
sound
asleep
said
priscilla
then
you
will
have
to
sit
there
all
night
and
i
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
to
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
talk
will
you
gag
me
or
put
a
pillow
over
my
face
like
the
blackamoor
in
the
play
the
minx
and
her
governess
retired
still
disputing
after
angela
had
been
desperately
hugged
by
henriette
who
brimmed
over
with
warmest
affection
in
the
midst
of
her
insolence
they
were
gone
their
voices
sounding
in
the
stillness
on
the
terrace
and
then
on
the
staircase
and
through
the
great
empty
rooms
where
the
windows
were
open
to
the
sultry
night
while
the
host
of
idle
servants
caroused
in
the
basement
in
a
spacious
room
with
a
vaulted
roof
like
a
college
hall
where
they
were
free
to
be
as
noisy
or
as
drunken
as
they
pleased
my
lady
was
out
had
taken
only
her
chair
and
running
footmen
and
had
sent
chairmen
and
footmen
back
from
whitehall
with
an
intimation
that
they
would
be
wanted
no
more
that
night
angela
lingered
on
the
terrace
in
the
sultry
summer
gloom
watching
solitary
boats
moving
to
and
fro
shadowy
as
charon
she
dreaded
the
stillness
of
silent
rooms
and
to
be
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
which
were
not
of
the
happiest
her
sister
relations
with
de
malfort
troubled
her
innocent
as
they
doubtless
were
innocent
as
that
close
friendship
of
henrietta
of
england
with
her
cousin
of
france
when
they
two
spent
the
fair
midsummer
nights
roaming
in
palace
gardens
close
as
lovers
but
only
fast
friends
malicious
tongues
had
babbled
even
of
that
innocent
friendship
and
there
were
those
who
said
that
if
monsieur
behaved
liked
a
brute
to
his
lovely
young
wife
it
was
because
he
had
good
reason
for
jealousy
of
louis
in
the
past
as
well
as
of
de
guiche
in
the
present
these
innocent
friendships
are
ever
the
cause
of
uneasiness
to
the
it
is
like
seeing
children
at
play
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
they
are
too
near
danger
and
destruction
hyacinth
being
about
as
able
to
carry
a
secret
as
to
carry
an
elephant
had
betrayed
by
a
hundred
indications
that
a
plot
of
some
kind
was
being
hatched
between
her
and
de
malfort
and
before
going
out
she
had
made
too
much
fuss
about
so
simple
a
matter
as
a
at
lady
sarah
who
had
her
every
night
and
was
popularly
supposed
to
keep
house
upon
her
winnings
and
to
have
no
higher
code
of
honour
than
de
gramont
had
when
he
invited
a
brother
officer
to
supper
on
purpose
to
rook
him
killigrew
comedy
had
been
discussed
in
angela
hearing
people
who
had
been
deprived
of
the
theatre
for
over
a
year
were
greedy
and
eager
spectators
of
all
the
plays
produced
at
court
but
this
production
was
an
exceptional
event
killigrew
wit
and
impudence
and
impecuniosity
were
the
talk
of
the
town
and
anything
written
by
that
audacious
jester
was
sure
to
be
worth
hearing
had
her
sister
gone
to
whitehall
to
see
the
new
comedy
in
direct
disobedience
to
her
husband
instead
of
to
so
accustomed
an
entertainment
as
lady
sarah
and
was
that
the
only
mystery
between
hyacinth
and
de
malfort
or
was
there
something
else
some
such
as
they
had
planned
and
talked
about
openly
till
a
fortnight
ago
and
had
suddenly
dropped
altogether
as
if
the
notion
were
abandoned
and
forgotten
it
was
so
unlike
hyacinth
to
be
secret
about
anything
and
her
sister
feared
therefore
that
there
was
some
plot
of
de
contriving
de
malfort
whom
she
regarded
with
distrust
and
even
repugnance
for
she
could
recall
no
sentiment
of
his
that
did
not
make
for
evil
beneath
that
gossamer
veil
of
airy
language
which
he
flung
over
vicious
theories
the
conscienceless
unrelenting
character
of
the
man
had
been
discovered
by
those
clear
eyes
of
the
meditative
onlooker
alas
what
a
man
to
be
her
sister
closest
friend
claiming
privileges
by
long
association
which
hyacinth
would
have
been
the
last
to
grant
her
dissolute
admirers
of
yesterday
but
which
were
only
the
more
perilous
for
those
memories
of
childhood
that
justified
a
so
dangerous
friendship
she
was
startled
from
these
painful
reflections
by
the
clatter
of
hoofs
on
the
paved
courtyard
east
of
the
house
and
the
jingle
of
and
bit
sounds
instantly
followed
by
the
ringing
of
the
bell
at
the
principal
door
was
it
her
sister
coming
home
so
early
no
lady
fareham
had
gone
out
in
her
chair
was
it
his
lordship
returning
unannounced
he
had
stated
no
time
for
his
return
telling
his
wife
only
that
on
his
business
in
paris
being
finished
he
would
come
back
without
delay
indeed
hyacinth
had
debated
the
chances
of
his
arrival
this
very
evening
with
half
a
dozen
of
her
particular
friends
who
knew
that
she
was
going
to
see
play
fate
can
not
be
so
perverse
as
to
bring
him
back
on
the
only
night
when
his
return
would
be
troublesome
she
said
fate
is
always
perverse
and
a
husband
is
very
lucky
if
there
is
but
one
day
out
of
seven
on
which
his
return
would
be
troublesome
answered
one
of
her
gossips
fate
had
been
perverse
for
angela
heard
her
deep
strong
voice
talking
in
the
hall
and
presently
he
came
down
the
marble
steps
to
the
terrace
and
came
towards
her
white
with
kentish
dust
and
carrying
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
she
had
risen
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
and
was
hurrying
to
the
house
as
he
met
her
he
came
close
up
to
her
scarcely
according
her
the
civility
of
greeting
never
had
she
seen
his
countenance
more
gloomy
you
can
tell
me
truer
than
those
drunken
devils
below
stairs
he
said
where
is
your
sister
at
lady
sarah
tewkesbury
so
her
swears
but
her
chairmen
whom
i
found
asleep
in
the
hall
say
they
set
her
down
at
the
palace
at
whitehall
yes
at
whitehall
there
is
a
modish
performance
there
i
hear
but
i
doubt
it
is
over
for
the
strand
was
crowded
with
hackney
coaches
moving
eastward
i
passed
a
pair
of
handsome
eyes
in
a
gilded
chair
that
flashed
fury
at
me
as
i
rode
by
which
i
swear
were
palmer
and
waiting
for
me
in
the
hall
i
found
this
letter
that
had
just
been
handed
in
by
a
link
who
doubtless
belonged
to
the
same
lady
read
angela
the
contents
are
scarce
long
enough
to
weary
you
she
took
the
letter
from
him
with
a
hand
that
trembled
so
that
she
could
hardly
hold
the
sheet
of
paper
watch
there
is
an
intrigue
afoot
this
night
and
you
must
be
a
greater
dullard
than
i
think
you
if
you
can
not
unmask
a
deceitful
the
final
word
was
one
which
modern
manners
forbid
in
speech
or
printed
page
angela
pallid
cheek
flushed
crimson
at
the
sight
of
the
vile
epithet
oh
insane
lightness
of
conduct
which
made
such
an
insult
possible
standing
there
confronting
the
angry
husband
with
that
detestable
paper
in
her
hand
she
felt
a
pang
of
compunction
at
the
thought
that
she
might
have
been
more
strenuous
in
her
arguments
with
her
sister
more
earnest
and
constant
in
reproof
when
the
peace
and
good
repute
of
two
lives
were
at
stake
was
it
for
her
to
consider
any
question
of
older
or
younger
or
to
be
restrained
by
the
fear
of
offending
a
sister
who
had
been
so
generous
and
indulgent
to
her
fareham
saw
her
distress
and
looked
at
her
with
angry
suspicion
come
he
said
i
scarce
expected
a
lying
answer
from
you
and
yet
you
join
with
servants
to
deceive
me
you
know
your
sister
is
not
at
lady
sarah
i
know
nothing
except
that
wherever
she
is
i
will
vouch
that
she
is
innocently
employed
and
has
done
nothing
to
deserve
that
infamous
aspersion
giving
him
back
the
letter
innocently
employed
you
carry
matters
with
a
high
hand
innocently
employed
in
a
company
of
listening
to
killigrew
ribald
jokes
killigrew
the
profanest
of
them
all
who
can
turn
the
greatest
calamity
this
city
ever
suffered
to
horseplay
and
jeering
innocently
employed
in
direct
disobedience
to
her
husband
so
innocently
employed
that
she
makes
her
servants
and
her
sister
tell
lies
to
cover
her
innocence
hector
as
much
as
you
please
i
have
told
your
lordship
no
lies
and
with
your
permission
i
will
leave
you
to
recover
your
temper
before
my
return
which
i
doubt
will
happen
within
the
next
hour
she
moved
quickly
past
him
towards
the
house
angela
forgive
me
he
began
trying
to
detain
her
but
she
hurried
on
through
the
open
french
window
and
ran
upstairs
to
her
room
where
she
locked
herself
in
for
some
minutes
she
walked
up
and
down
profoundly
agitated
thinking
out
the
position
of
affairs
to
fareham
she
had
carried
matters
with
a
high
hand
but
she
was
full
of
fear
the
play
was
over
and
her
sister
who
doubtless
had
been
among
the
audience
had
not
come
home
was
she
staying
at
the
palace
gossiping
with
the
shining
among
that
brilliant
unscrupulous
crowd
where
intrigue
was
in
the
very
air
where
no
woman
was
credited
with
virtue
and
every
man
was
remorseless
the
anonymous
letter
scarcely
influenced
angela
thoughts
in
these
agitated
moments
that
was
but
a
foul
assault
on
character
by
a
woman
but
the
furtive
confabulations
of
the
past
week
must
have
had
some
motive
and
her
sister
fluttered
manner
before
leaving
the
house
had
marked
this
night
as
the
crisis
of
the
plot
angela
could
imagine
nothing
but
that
ghostly
masquerading
which
had
in
the
first
place
been
discussed
freely
in
her
presence
and
she
could
but
wonder
that
de
malfort
and
her
sister
should
have
made
a
mystery
about
a
plan
which
she
had
known
in
its
inception
the
more
deeply
she
considered
all
the
circumstances
the
more
she
inclined
to
suspect
some
evil
intention
on
de
malfort
part
of
which
hyacinth
so
frank
so
shallow
might
be
too
easy
a
dupe
i
do
little
good
doubting
and
suspecting
and
wondering
here
she
said
to
herself
and
after
hastily
lighting
the
candles
on
her
she
began
to
unlace
the
bodice
of
her
silk
mantua
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
changed
her
elegant
evening
attire
for
a
dark
cloth
gown
short
in
the
skirt
and
loose
in
the
sleeves
which
had
been
made
for
her
to
wear
upon
the
river
in
this
costume
she
could
handle
a
pair
of
sculls
as
freely
as
a
waterman
when
she
had
put
on
a
little
black
silk
hood
she
extinguished
her
candles
pulled
aside
the
curtain
which
obscured
the
open
window
and
looked
out
on
the
terrace
there
was
just
light
enough
to
show
her
that
the
coast
was
clear
the
iron
gate
at
the
top
of
the
was
seldom
locked
nor
were
the
often
shut
as
boats
were
being
taken
in
and
out
at
all
hours
and
for
the
rest
neglect
and
carelessness
might
always
be
reckoned
upon
in
the
fareham
household
she
ran
lightly
down
a
side
staircase
and
so
by
an
obscure
door
to
the
no
the
gate
was
not
locked
and
there
was
not
a
creature
within
sight
to
observe
or
impede
her
movements
she
went
down
the
steps
to
the
paved
quay
below
the
garden
terrace
the
house
where
the
wherries
were
kept
was
wide
open
and
better
still
there
was
a
skiff
moored
by
the
side
of
the
steps
as
if
waiting
for
her
and
she
had
but
to
take
a
pair
of
sculls
from
the
rack
and
step
into
the
boat
unmoor
and
away
westward
with
swiftly
dipping
oars
in
the
soft
summer
silence
broken
now
and
then
by
sounds
of
singing
a
tipsy
unmelodious
strain
perhaps
were
it
heard
too
near
but
musical
in
the
distance
as
the
rise
and
fall
of
voices
crept
along
a
reach
of
running
water
the
night
was
hot
and
oppressive
even
on
the
river
but
it
was
better
here
than
anywhere
else
and
angela
breathed
more
freely
as
she
bent
over
her
sculls
rowing
with
all
her
might
intent
upon
reaching
that
she
knew
of
in
the
very
shortest
possible
time
the
boat
was
heavy
but
she
had
the
incoming
tide
to
help
her
was
fareham
hunting
for
his
wife
she
wondered
would
he
go
to
lady
sarah
lodgings
in
the
first
place
and
not
finding
hyacinth
there
to
whitehall
and
then
would
he
remember
the
assembly
at
millbank
in
which
he
had
taken
no
part
and
apparently
no
interest
and
would
he
extend
his
search
to
the
ruined
abbey
at
the
worst
angela
would
be
there
before
him
to
prepare
her
sister
for
the
angry
suspicions
which
she
would
have
to
meet
he
was
not
likely
to
think
of
that
place
till
he
had
exhausted
all
other
chances
it
was
not
much
more
than
a
mile
from
fareham
house
to
that
desolate
bit
of
country
betwixt
westminster
and
chelsea
where
the
modern
occupied
the
old
monkish
pastures
as
angela
ran
her
boat
inshore
she
expected
to
see
venetian
lanterns
and
to
hear
music
and
voices
and
all
the
indications
of
a
gay
assembly
but
there
were
only
silence
and
darkness
save
for
one
lighted
window
in
the
dairyman
and
she
thought
that
she
had
come
upon
a
futile
errand
and
had
been
mistaken
in
her
conjectures
she
moored
her
boat
to
the
wooden
and
went
on
shore
to
examine
the
premises
the
revelry
might
be
designed
for
a
later
hour
though
it
was
now
near
midnight
and
lady
sarah
party
had
assembled
at
eleven
she
walked
across
a
meadow
where
the
dewy
grass
was
cool
under
her
feet
and
so
to
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
dairyman
house
a
shabby
building
attached
like
a
wen
to
the
ruined
refectory
she
started
at
hearing
the
snort
of
a
horse
and
the
jingling
of
bit
and
and
came
suddenly
upon
a
with
a
couple
of
standing
beside
their
team
whose
coach
is
this
she
asked
malfy
your
ladyship
the
french
gentleman
from
james
street
my
lady
explained
the
other
man
did
you
bring
monsieur
de
malfort
here
no
madam
we
was
told
to
be
here
at
eleven
with
horses
as
fresh
as
fire
and
the
poor
tits
be
mighty
impatient
to
be
moving
steady
champion
you
have
work
enough
this
side
dartford
to
the
near
leader
who
was
shaking
his
head
vehemently
and
pawing
the
gravel
angela
waited
to
ask
no
further
questions
but
made
straight
for
the
unglazed
window
through
which
spavinger
and
his
companions
had
entered
there
was
no
light
in
the
great
vaulted
room
save
the
faint
light
of
summer
stars
and
two
figures
were
there
in
the
dimness
a
woman
standing
straight
and
tall
in
a
satin
gown
whose
pale
sheen
reflected
the
starlight
a
woman
whose
right
arm
was
flung
above
her
head
bare
and
white
her
hand
clasping
her
brow
distractedly
and
a
man
who
knelt
at
her
feet
grasping
the
hand
that
hung
at
her
side
looking
up
at
her
and
talking
eagerly
with
passionate
gestures
her
voice
was
clearer
than
his
and
angela
heard
her
repeating
with
a
piteous
shrillness
no
no
no
no
henri
no
she
stayed
to
hear
no
more
but
sprang
through
the
opening
between
the
broken
mullions
and
rushed
to
her
sister
side
and
as
de
malfort
started
to
his
feet
she
thrust
him
vehemently
aside
and
clasped
hyacinth
in
her
arms
you
here
mistress
he
muttered
in
a
surly
tone
may
i
ask
what
business
brought
you
for
i
swear
you
was
invited
i
have
come
to
save
my
sister
from
a
villain
sir
but
oh
my
sweet
i
little
dreamt
thou
hadst
such
need
of
me
nay
love
thou
didst
ever
make
tragedies
out
of
nothing
said
hyacinth
struggling
to
disguise
hysterical
tears
with
airy
laughter
but
i
am
right
glad
all
the
same
that
you
are
come
for
this
gentleman
has
put
a
scurvy
trick
upon
me
and
brought
me
here
on
pretence
of
a
gay
assembly
that
has
no
existence
he
is
a
villain
and
a
traitor
said
angela
in
deep
indignant
tones
dear
love
thou
hast
been
in
danger
i
dare
scarce
think
of
fareham
is
searching
for
you
fareham
in
london
returned
an
hour
ago
hark
she
lifted
her
finger
warningly
as
a
bell
rang
and
the
voice
sounded
outside
the
house
calling
to
some
one
to
open
the
door
he
is
here
cried
hyacinth
distractedly
for
god
sake
hide
me
from
him
not
for
worlds
not
for
worlds
would
i
meet
him
nay
you
have
nothing
to
fear

is
monsieur
de
malfort
who
has
to
answer
for
what
he
has
done
henri
he
will
kill
you
alas
you
know
not
what
he
is
in
anger
i
have
seen
him
once
in
paris
when
he
thought
a
man
was
insolent
to
me
god
the
thunder
of
his
voice
the
blackness
of
his
brow
he
will
kill
you
oh
if
you
love
me
if
you
ever
loved
me
come
out
of
his
way
he
is
fatal
with
his
sword
and
am
i
such
a
tyro
at
fence
or
such
a
poltroon
as
to
be
afraid
to
meet
him
no
hyacinth
i
go
with
you
to
dover
or
i
stand
my
ground
and
face
him
you
shall
not
sobbed
hyacinth
i
will
not
have
your
blood
on
my
head
come
come
by
the
garden
by
the
river
she
dragged
him
towards
the
window
he
pretending
to
resist
as
angela
thought
yet
letting
himself
be
led
as
she
pleased
to
lead
him
they
had
but
just
crossed
the
yawning
gap
between
the
mullions
and
vanished
into
the
night
when
fareham
burst
into
the
room
with
his
sword
drawn
and
came
towards
angela
who
stood
in
shadow
her
face
half
hidden
in
her
hood
so
madam
i
have
found
you
at
last
he
said
and
in
time
to
stop
your
journey
though
not
to
save
myself
the
dishonour
of
a
wanton
wife
but
it
is
your
paramour
i
am
looking
for
not
you
where
is
that
craven
hiding
he
went
back
to
the
inhabited
part
of
the
house
and
returned
after
a
hasty
examination
of
the
premises
carrying
the
lamp
which
had
lighted
his
search
only
to
find
the
same
solitary
figure
in
the
vast
bare
room
angela
had
moved
nearer
the
window
and
had
sunk
exhausted
upon
a
large
carved
oak
chair
which
might
be
a
relic
of
the
monkish
occupation
fareham
came
to
her
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
he
has
given
me
a
clean
pair
of
heels
he
said
but
i
know
where
to
find
him
it
is
but
a
pleasure
postponed
and
now
woman
you
had
best
return
to
the
house
your
folly
or
your
sin
has
disgraced
for
at
least
it
must
needs
shelter
you
come
the
hooded
figure
rose
at
his
bidding
and
he
saw
the
face
in
the
lamplight
you
he
gasped
you
yes
fareham
it
is
i
can
not
you
take
a
kind
view
of
a
foolish
business
and
believe
there
has
been
only
folly
and
no
dishonour
in
the
purpose
that
brought
me
here
you
he
repeated
you
his
bearing
was
that
of
a
man
who
staggers
under
a
crushing
blow
a
stroke
so
unexpected
that
he
can
but
wonder
and
suffer
he
set
down
the
lamp
with
a
shaking
hand
then
took
two
or
three
hurried
turns
up
and
down
the
room
then
stopped
abruptly
by
the
lamp
snatched
the
anonymous
letter
from
his
breast
and
read
the
lines
over
again
intrigue
on
foot
no
name
and
i
took
it
for
granted
my
wife
was
meant
i
looked
for
folly
from
her
but
wisdom
honour
purity
all
the
virtues
from
you
oh
what
was
the
use
of
my
fortitude
what
the
motive
of
here
striking
himself
upon
the
breast
if
you
were
unchaste
angela
you
have
broken
my
heart
there
was
a
long
pause
before
she
answered
and
her
face
was
turned
from
him
to
hide
her
streaming
tears
at
last
she
was
able
to
reply
calmly
indeed
fareham
you
do
wrong
to
take
this
matter
so
passionately
you
may
trust
my
sister
and
me
on
my
honour
you
have
no
cause
to
be
angry
with
either
of
us
and
when
i
gave
you
this
letter
to
read
he
went
on
disregarding
her
protestations
you
knew
that
you
were
coming
here
to
meet
a
lover
you
hurried
away
from
me
dissembler
as
you
were
to
steal
to
this
lonely
place
at
midnight
to
fling
yourself
into
his
arms
tell
me
where
he
is
hiding
that
i
may
kill
him
now
while
i
pant
for
vengeance
such
rage
as
mine
can
not
wait
for
idle
forms
now
now
now
is
the
time
to
reckon
with
your
seducer
fareham
you
cover
me
with
insults
he
had
rushed
to
the
door
still
carrying
his
naked
sword
but
he
turned
back
as
she
spoke
and
stood
looking
at
her
from
head
to
foot
with
a
savage
scornfulness
insult
he
cried
you
have
sunk
too
low
for
insult
there
are
no
words
that
i
know
vile
enough
to
stigmatise
such
disgrace
as
yours
do
you
know
what
you
have
been
to
me
angela
a
saint
a
star
ineffably
pure
ineffably
remote
a
creature
to
worship
at
a
distance
for
whose
sake
it
was
scarce
a
sacrifice
to
repress
all
that
is
common
to
the
base
heart
of
man
from
whom
a
kind
word
was
enough
for
happiness
so
pure
so
far
away
so
detached
from
this
vile
age
we
live
in
god
how
that
saintly
face
has
cheated
me
mock
saint
mock
nun
a
creature
of
passions
like
my
own
but
more
stealthy
from
top
to
toe
an
incarnate
lie
he
flung
out
of
the
room
and
she
heard
his
footsteps
about
the
house
and
heard
doors
opened
and
shut
she
waited
for
no
more
but
being
sure
by
this
time
that
her
sister
had
left
the
premises
her
own
desire
was
to
return
to
farebam
house
as
soon
as
possible
counting
upon
finding
hyacinth
there
yet
with
a
sick
fear
that
the
seducer
might
take
base
advantage
of
her
sister
terror
and
confused
spirits
and
hustle
her
off
upon
the
fatal
journey
he
had
planned
the
boat
lay
where
she
had
moored
it
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
stair
and
she
was
stepping
into
it
when
fareham
ran
hastily
to
the
bank
your
paramour
has
got
clear
off
he
said
and
then
asked
curtly
how
came
you
by
that
boat
i
brought
it
from
fareham
house
what
you
came
here
alone
by
water
at
so
late
an
hour
you
adventuress
other
women
need
education
in
vice
but
to
you
it
comes
by
nature
he
pulled
off
his
doublet
as
he
stepped
into
the
boat
then
seated
himself
and
took
the
sculls
has
your
lordship
not
left
a
horse
waiting
for
you
angela
inquired
hesitatingly
my
lordship
horse
will
find
his
stables
before
morning
with
the
groom
that
has
him
in
charge
i
am
going
to
row
you
home
love
expectant
is
bold
but
disappointed
love
may
lack
courage
for
a
solitary
jaunt
after
midnight
come
mistress
let
us
have
no
ceremony
we
have
done
with
that
for
ever
as
we
have
done
with
friendship
there
are
thousands
of
women
in
england
all
much
of
a
pattern
and
you
are
one
of
them
that
is
the
end
of
our
romance
he
bent
to
his
work
and
rowed
with
a
steady
stroke
and
in
a
stubborn
silence
which
lasted
till
it
was
more
strangely
broken
than
such
angry
silence
is
apt
to
be
the
tide
was
still
running
up
and
it
was
as
much
as
the
single
oarsman
could
do
in
that
heavy
boat
to
hold
his
own
against
the
stream
angela
sat
watching
him
with
her
gaze
rooted
to
that
dark
countenance
and
bare
head
on
which
the
hair
waved
thick
and
strong
for
fareham
had
never
consented
to
envelop
his
neck
and
shoulders
in
a
mantle
of
dead
men
tresses
and
wore
his
own
hair
after
the
fashion
of
charles
the
first
time
so
intent
was
her
watch
that
the
objects
on
either
shore
passed
her
like
shadows
in
a
dream
the
primate
palace
on
her
right
hand
as
the
boat
swept
round
that
great
bend
which
the
river
makes
opposite
lambeth
marsh
on
her
left
as
they
neared
london
the
stern
grandeur
of
the
abbey
and
margaret
it
was
only
as
they
approached
whitehall
that
she
became
aware
of
a
light
upon
the
water
which
was
not
the
reflection
of
daybreak
and
looking
suddenly
up
she
saw
the
fierce
glare
of
a
conflagration
in
the
eastern
sky
and
cried
there
is
a
fire
my
lord
a
great
fire
i
doubt
in
the
city
the
long
roof
and
massive
tower
of
st
paul
stood
dark
against
the
vivid
splendour
of
that
sky
and
every
timber
in
the
scaffolding
showed
like
a
black
lattice
across
the
crimson
and
sulphur
of
raging
flames
fareham
looked
round
without
moving
his
sculls
from
the
rowlocks
a
great
fire
in
verity
mistress
would
god
it
meant
the
fulfilment
of
prophecy
what
prophecy
sir
the
end
of
the
world
with
which
we
are
threatened
in
this
year
god
how
the
flames
rage
and
mount
would
it
were
the
great
fire
and
he
had
come
to
judge
us
and
to
empty
the
vials
of
his
wrath
upon
profligates
and
seducers
he
looked
at
the
face
opposite
radiant
with
reflected
rose
and
gold
supernal
in
that
strange
light
and
oh
so
calm
in
every
line
and
feature
the
large
dark
eyes
meeting
his
with
a
gaze
that
seemed
to
him
half
indignant
half
reproachful
oh
what
hypocrites
these
women
are
he
told
himself
and
all
alike
all
alike
what
comedians
for
acting
one
need
not
go
to
the
duke
or
the
king
one
may
see
it
at
one
own
board
by
one
own
hearth
acting
nothing
but
acting
and
i
thought
that
in
the
universal
mass
of
falsehood
and
folly
there
were
some
rare
stars
dwelling
apart
here
and
there
and
that
she
was
one
of
them
an
idle
dream
nature
has
made
them
all
in
one
mould
and
it
is
but
by
means
and
opportunity
that
they
differ
higher
and
higher
rose
that
vast
sheet
of
vivid
colour
and
now
every
tower
and
steeple
was
bathed
in
rosy
light
or
else
stood
black
against
the
radiant
sky
towers
illuminated
towers
in
densest
shadow
the
slim
spars
of
ships
showing
as
if
drawn
with
pen
and
ink
on
a
sulphur
background
a
scene
of
surpassing
splendour
and
terror
fareham
had
seen
flemish
villages
blazing
flemish
citadels
exploding
their
fragments
hurled
skyward
in
a
blue
flame
of
gunpowder
but
never
this
vast
arch
of
crimson
glowing
and
growing
before
his
astonished
gaze
as
he
paddled
the
boat
inshore
and
stood
up
to
watch
the
great
disaster
god
has
remembered
the
new
sodom
he
said
savagely
he
punished
us
with
pestilence
and
we
took
no
heed
and
now
he
tries
us
with
fire
but
if
it
come
not
yonder
pointing
to
whitehall
which
was
immediately
above
them
for
their
boat
lay
close
to
the
king
if
like
the
contagion
it
stays
in
the
east
and
only
the
citizens
suffer
why
vive
la
bagatelle
we
and
our
concubines
have
no
part
in
the
punishment
we
who
call
down
the
fire
do
not
suffer
it
spellbound
by
that
strange
spectacle
fareham
stood
and
gazed
and
angela
was
afraid
to
urge
him
to
take
the
boat
on
to
fareham
house
anxious
as
she
was
to
span
those
few
hundred
yards
of
distance
to
be
assured
of
her
sister
safety
they
waited
thus
nearly
an
hour
the
sky
ever
increasing
in
brilliancy
and
the
sounds
of
voices
and
tramp
of
hurrying
feet
growing
with
every
minute
whitehall
was
now
all
alive
men
and
women
in
a
careless
undress
at
every
window
some
of
them
hanging
half
out
of
the
window
to
talk
to
people
in
the
court
below
shrieks
of
terror
or
of
wonder
ejaculations
and
oaths
sounding
on
every
side
while
fareham
who
had
moored
the
boat
to
an
iron
ring
in
the
wall
by
his
majesty
stairs
stood
gloomy
and
motionless
and
made
no
further
comment
only
watched
the
conflagration
in
dismal
silence
fascinated
by
that
prodigious
ruin
it
was
but
the
beginning
of
that
stupendous
destruction
yet
it
was
already
great
enough
to
seem
like
the
end
of
all
things
and
last
night
in
the
court
theatre
killigrew
players
were
making
a
jest
of
a
pestilence
that
filled
the
by
thousands
fareham
muttered
as
if
awaking
from
a
dream
well
the
wits
will
have
a
new
subject
for
their
mirth
london
in
flames
he
untied
the
rope
took
his
seat
and
rowed
out
into
the
stream
within
that
hour
in
which
they
had
waited
the
thames
had
covered
itself
with
traffic
boats
were
moving
westward
loaded
with
frightened
souls
in
casual
attire
and
with
heaps
of
humble
goods
and
chattels
some
whose
houses
were
nearest
the
river
had
been
quick
enough
to
save
a
portion
of
their
poor
possessions
and
to
get
them
packed
on
barges
but
these
were
the
wise
minority
the
greater
number
of
the
sufferers
were
stupefied
by
the
suddenness
of
the
calamity
the
rapidity
with
which
destruction
rushed
upon
them
the
flames
leaping
from
house
to
house
spanning
chasms
of
emptiness
darting
hither
and
thither
like
lizards
or
winged
scorpions
or
breaking
out
mysteriously
in
fresh
places
so
that
already
the
cry
of
arson
had
arisen
and
the
fire
was
set
down
to
fiendish
creatures
labouring
secretly
at
a
work
of
universal
destruction
most
of
the
sufferers
looked
on
at
the
ruin
of
their
homes
paralysed
by
horror
unable
to
help
themselves
or
to
mitigate
their
losses
by
energetic
action
of
any
kind
dumb
and
helpless
as
sheep
they
saw
their
property
destroyed
their
children
lives
imperilled
and
could
only
thank
providence
and
those
few
brave
men
who
helped
them
in
their
helplessness
for
escape
from
a
fiery
death
panic
and
ruin
prevailed
within
a
mile
eastward
of
fareham
house
when
the
boat
ground
against
the
edge
of
the
marble
and
angela
alighted
and
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
and
made
her
way
straight
to
the
house
the
door
stood
wide
open
and
candles
were
burning
in
the
vestibule
the
servants
were
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
terrace
watching
the
fire
too
much
engrossed
to
see
their
master
and
his
companion
land
at
the
western
steps
at
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
angela
heard
herself
called
by
a
crystalline
voice
and
looking
up
saw
henriette
hanging
over
the
banister
rail
auntie
where
have
you
been
is
your
mother
with
you
angela
asked
mother
is
locked
in
her
and
mighty
sullen
she
told
me
to
go
to
bed
as
if
anybody
could
lie
quietly
in
bed
with
london
burning
added
papillon
her
tone
implying
that
a
great
city
in
flames
was
a
kind
of
entertainment
that
could
not
be
too
highly
appreciated
she
came
flying
downstairs
in
her
pretty
silken
deshabille
with
her
hair
streaming
and
flung
her
arm
round
her
aunt
neck
ma
chatte
where
have
you
been
on
the
terrace
fi
donc
menteuse
i
saw
you
and
my
father
land
at
the
west
stairs
five
minutes
ago
we
had
been
looking
at
the
fire
and
never
offered
to
take
me
with
you
what
a
greedy
pig
indeed
dearest
it
is
no
scene
for
little
girls
to
look
upon
and
when
i
am
grown
up
what
shall
i
have
to
talk
about
if
i
miss
all
the
great
sights
come
to
your
room
love
you
will
see
only
too
much
from
your
windows
i
am
going
to
your
mother
ce
pas
la
peine
she
is
in
one
of
her
tempers
and
has
locked
herself
in
no
matter
she
will
see
me
je
doute
she
came
home
in
a
nearly
two
hours
ago
with
monsieur
de
malfort
and
i
think
they
must
have
quarrelled
they
bade
each
other
good
night
so
uncivilly
but
he
was
more
huffed
than
mother
where
were
you
that
you
know
so
much
in
the
gallery
did
i
not
tell
you
i
should
be
able
to
sleep
i
went
into
the
gallery
for
coolness
and
then
i
heard
the
coach
in
the
courtyard
and
the
doors
opened
and
i
listened
inquisitive
child
no
i
was
not
inquisitive
i
was
only
vastly
hipped
for
want
of
knowing
what
to
do
with
myself
and
i
ran
to
bid
her
ladyship
good
morning
for
it
was
close
upon
one
but
she
frowned
at
me
and
pushed
me
aside
with
a
to
your
bed
troublesome
imp
what
business
have
you
up
at
this
hour
much
business
as
you
have
riding
about
in
your
coach
i
had
a
mind
to
say
mais
je
me
tenais
coy
and
made
her
ladyship
la
belle
jennings
curtsy
instead
she
sinks
lower
and
rises
straighter
than
any
of
the
other
ladies
i
watched
her
on
mother
lord
auntie
how
white
you
are
one
might
take
you
for
a
ghost
angela
put
the
little
prattler
aside
more
gently
perhaps
than
the
mother
had
done
and
passed
hurriedly
on
to
lady
fareham
room
the
door
was
still
locked
but
she
would
take
no
denial
i
must
speak
with
you
she
said
chapter
xvii
the
motive
murder
for
lady
fareham
and
her
sister
september
and
october
made
a
blank
interval
in
the
story
of
life
uneventful
as
the
empty
page
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
they
spent
those
months
at
fareham
a
house
which
hyacinth
detested
a
neighbourhood
where
she
had
never
condescended
to
make
friends
she
condemned
the
local
gentry
as
a
collection
of
nobodies
and
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
please
the
three
or
four
great
families
within
a
drive
because
though
they
had
rank
and
consequence
they
had
not
fashion
the
of
paris
and
london
was
wanting
to
them
lord
fareham
had
insisted
upon
leaving
london
on
the
third
of
september
and
had
his
wife
declared
out
of
pure
malignity
taken
his
family
to
fareham
a
place
she
hated
rather
than
to
chilton
a
place
she
loved
at
least
as
much
as
any
civilised
mortal
could
love
the
country
never
hyacinth
protested
had
her
husband
been
so
sullen
and
ferocious
he
is
not
like
an
angry
man
she
told
angela
but
like
a
wounded
lion
and
yet
since
your
goodness
took
all
the
blame
of
my
unlucky
escapade
upon
your
shoulders
and
he
knows
nothing
of
de
malfort
insolent
attempt
to
carry
me
off
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
have
become
such
a
gloomy
savage
she
accepted
her
sister
sacrifice
with
an
amiable
lightness
how
could
it
harm
angela
to
be
thought
to
have
run
out
at
midnight
for
a
frolic
rendezvous
the
maids
of
honour
had
some
such
adventure
half
a
dozen
times
in
a
season
and
were
found
out
and
laughed
at
and
laughed
again
and
wound
up
their
tempestuous
careers
by
marrying
great
noblemen
if
you
can
but
get
yourself
talked
about
you
may
marry
as
high
as
you
choose
lady
fareham
told
her
sister
early
in
november
they
went
back
to
london
and
though
all
hyacinth
fine
people
protested
that
the
town
stank
of
burnt
wood
smoked
oil
and
resin
and
was
altogether
odious
they
rejoiced
not
the
less
to
be
back
again
lady
fareham
plunged
with
renewed
eagerness
into
the
whirlpool
of
pleasure
and
tried
to
drag
angela
with
her
but
it
was
a
surprise
to
both
and
to
one
a
cause
for
uneasiness
when
his
lordship
began
to
show
himself
in
scenes
which
he
had
for
the
most
part
avoided
as
well
as
reviled
for
some
unexplained
reason
he
became
now
a
frequent
attendant
at
the
evening
festivities
at
whitehall
and
without
even
the
pretence
of
being
interested
or
amused
there
fareham
appearance
at
court
caused
more
surprise
than
pleasure
in
that
brilliant
circle
the
statue
of
the
comandante
would
scarcely
have
seemed
a
grimmer
guest
he
was
there
in
the
midst
of
laughter
and
delight
with
never
a
smile
upon
his
stern
features
he
was
silent
for
the
most
part
or
if
badgered
into
talking
by
some
of
his
more
familiar
acquaintances
would
vent
his
spleen
in
a
tirade
that
startled
them
as
the
pleasant
chirpings
of
a
are
startled
by
the
raid
of
a
dog
they
laughed
at
his
conversation
behind
his
back
but
in
his
presence
under
the
angry
light
of
those
grey
eyes
the
gloom
of
those
bent
brows
they
were
chilled
into
submission
and
civility
he
had
a
dignity
which
made
his
puritanical
plainness
more
patrician
than
rochester
finery
more
impressive
than
buckingham
graceful
splendour
the
force
and
vigour
of
his
countenance
were
more
striking
than
sedley
beauty
the
eyes
of
strangers
singled
him
out
in
that
gay
throng
and
people
wanted
to
know
who
he
was
and
what
he
had
done
for
fame
a
soldier
yes
cela
saute
aux
yeux
he
could
be
nothing
else
than
a
soldier
a
cavalier
of
the
old
school
albeit
younger
by
half
a
lifetime
than
southampton
and
clarendon
and
the
other
ghosts
of
the
troubles
charles
treated
him
with
chill
civility
why
does
the
man
come
here
without
his
wife
he
asked
de
malfort
there
is
a
sister
too
fresher
and
fairer
than
her
ladyship
why
are
we
to
have
the
shadow
without
the
sun
yet
it
is
as
well
perhaps
they
keep
away
for
i
have
heard
of
a
visit
which
was
not
returned
a
condescension
from
a
woman
of
the
highest
rank
slighted
by
a
trumpery
baron
wife
and
after
an
offence
of
that
kind
she
could
only
have
brought
us
trouble
why
do
women
quarrel
wilmot
why
are
there
any
men
in
the
world
sir
if
there
were
none
women
would
live
together
like
lambs
in
a
meadow
it
is
only
about
us
they
fight
as
for
lady
fareham
she
is
adorable
though
no
longer
young
i
believe
she
will
be
thirty
on
her
next
birthday
and
the
sister
she
had
a
prettiness
i
thought
when
i
saw
her
at
oxford
she
looked
like
a
lily
till
i
spoke
to
her
and
then
flamed
like
a
red
rose
so
fresh
so
easily
startled
is
pity
that
shyness
of
youthful
purity
wears
off
in
a
week
i
dare
swear
by
this
time
kirkland
is
as
brazen
as
the
boldest
of
our
young
houris
yonder
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
maids
of
honour
the
queen
and
the
duchess
a
bevy
of
chatterers
waving
fans
giggling
whispering
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
impudentest
men
in
his
majesty
kingdom
the
men
who
gave
their
mornings
to
writing
comedies
coarser
than

mistress

has
an

modesty
which
would
outlive
even
a

at

sir
answered
rochester
if
i
did
not
adore
the
matron
i
should

the

happily
for
the

who
loves
her

thou
insolent
brat

eighteen

thyself

your

suppose
i
shall

at

yes
villain
for
at

thou
wilt

no

a

one

there
was

killed
at

his

who
believes
in

swears
england
was
never

as
under

the

this
rebel
i
know
not
for
all
i
have
seen
of
the
two
she
has
been
barely
civil
to
him
that
he
adores
her
is
obvious
and
i
know
lady
fareham
heart
is
set
upon
the
match
why
did
not
lady
fareham
return
the
countess
visit
there
was
no
need
to
ask
what
countess
be
sure
sir
the
husband
was
to
blame
if
there
was
want
of
respect
for
that
lovely
lady
i
can
answer
for
lady
fareham
right
feeling
in
that
matter
the
husband
takes
a
leaf
out
of
hyde
book
and
forgets
that
what
may
be
passed
over
in
the
lord
chancellor
and
a
man
of
prodigious
usefulness
is
intolerable
in
a
person
of
fareham
insignificance
nay
sir
insignificance
is
scarcely
the
word
i
would
as
soon
call
a
thunderstorm
insignificant
the
man
is
a
volcano
and
may
explode
at
any
provocation
we
want
no
such
suppressed
fires
at
whitehall
nor
do
we
want
long
faces
as
clarendon
may
discover
some
day
if
his
sermons
grow
too
troublesome
the
chancellor
is
a
domestic
man
as
your
majesty
may
infer
from
the
size
and
splendour
of
his
new
house
he
is
an
expensive
man
wilmot
i
believe
he
got
more
by
the
sale
of
dunkirk
than
his
master
did
in
that
case
your
majesty
can
not
do
better
than
shift
all
the
disgrace
of
the
transaction
on
to
his
shoulders
dunkirk
will
be
a
sure
card
to
play
when
clarendon
has
to
go
overboard
that
incivility
of
lady
fareham
in
the
matter
of
an
unreturned
visit
had
rankled
deep
in
the
bosom
of
the
king
imperious
mistress
to
sin
more
boldly
than
woman
ever
sinned
and
yet
to
claim
all
the
privileges
and
honours
due
to
virtue
was
but
a
trifling
inconsistency
in
a
mind
so
fortified
by
pride
that
it
scarce
knew
how
to
reckon
with
shame
that
she
in
her
supremacy
of
beauty
and
splendour
a
fortune
sparkling
in
either
ear
the
price
of
a
landed
estate
on
her
neck
that
she
barbara
countess
of
castlemaine
should
have
driven
in
a
windowless
coach
through
dusty
lanes
eating
dirt
as
it
were
with
her
train
of
court
gallants
on
horseback
at
her
coach
doors
her
ladies
in
a
carriage
in
the
rear
to
visit
a
person
of
lady
fareham
petty
quality
a
buckinghamshire
daughter
married
to
a
baron
of
henry
the
eighth
creation
and
that
this
amazing
condescension
received
with
a
smiling
and
curtsying
civility
should
have
been
unacknowledged
by
any
reciprocal
courtesy
was
an
affront
that
could
hardly
be
wiped
out
with
blood
indeed
it
could
never
be
atoned
for
the
wound
was
poisoned
and
would
rankle
and
fester
to
the
end
of
that
proud
life
yet
on
fareham
appearance
at
whitehall
lady
castlemaine
distinguished
with
a
marked
civility
and
even
condescended
smilingly
as
if
there
were
no
cause
of
quarrel
to
inquire
after
his
wife
her
ladyship
is
as
pretty
as
ever
though
we
are
all
growing
old
she
said
we
exchanged
curtsies
at
tunbridge
wells
the
other
day
i
wonder
how
it
is
we
never
get
further
than
smiles
and
curtsies
i
should
like
to
show
the
dear
woman
some
more
substantial
civility
she
is
buried
alive
in
your
stately
house
by
the
river
for
the
want
of
an
influential
friend
to
show
her
the
world
we
live
in
indeed
madam
my
wife
has
all
the
pleasure
she
desires
her
her
friends
and
her
admirers
rochester
is
always
hanging
about
your
garden
or
landing
from
his
wherry
when
i
go
by
or
if
he
himself
be
not
visible
there
are
a
couple
of
his
watermen
on
your
steps
my
lord
rochester
has
a
precocious
wit
which
amuses
my
wife
and
her
sister
and
then
there
is
de
malfort
an
impertinent
second
only
to
gramont
he
and
lady
fareham
are
twin
stars
i
have
seldom
seen
them
apart
since
de
malfort
has
the
honour
of
being
somewhat
intimate
with
your
ladyship
he
has
doubtless
given
you
full
particulars
of
his
friendship
for
my
wife
i
assure
you
it
will
bear
being
talked
about
there
are
no
secrets
in
it
really
i
thought
i
had
heard
something
about
a
sedan
which
took
the
wrong
road
after
killigrew
play
but
that
was
the
night
before
the
fire
good
god
my
lord
your
face
darkens
as
if
a
man
had
struck
you
whatever
happened
before
the
fire
should
have
been
burnt
out
of
our
memories
by
this
time
i
see
his
majesty
looking
this
way
madam
and
i
have
not
yet
paid
my
respects
to
him
fareham
said
moving
away
but
a
dazzling
hand
on
his
sleeve
arrested
him
oh
your
respects
will
keep
he
has
miss
stewart
giggling
at
his
elbow
strange
is
it
not
that
a
woman
with
as
much
brain
as
a
pigeon
can
amuse
a
man
who
reckons
himself
both
wise
and
witty
it
is
not
the
lady
who
amuses
the
gentleman
madam
she
has
the
good
sense
to
pretend
that
he
amuses
her
and
no
more
understands
a
jest
than
she
does
hebrew
she
is
conscious
of
pretty
teeth
and
an
enchanting
smile
wit
or
understanding
would
be
superfluous
answered
fareham
bowing
his
adieu
to
the
sultana
in
chief
there
was
a
great
assembly
with
music
and
dancing
on
the
birthday
to
which
lord
and
lady
fareham
and
mistress
kirkland
were
invited
and
again
angela
saw
and
wondered
at
the
splendid
scene
and
at
this
brilliant
world
which
calamity
could
not
touch
pestilence
had
ravaged
the
city
flames
had
devoured
it
yet
here
there
were
only
smiling
people
gorgeous
dress
incomparable
jewels
the
plague
had
not
touched
them
and
the
fire
had
not
reached
them
such
afflictions
are
for
the
common
herd
angela
promenaded
with
de
malfort
in
the
spacious
with
its
ceiling
of
such
prodigious
height
that
the
apotheosis
of
king
james
and
all
the
emblematical
figures
triumphal
cars
lions
bears
and
rams
and
baskets
of
fruit
which
filled
the
panels
might
as
well
have
been
executed
by
a
brush
as
by
the
pencil
of
the
great
fleming
we
are
a
little
kinder
to
rubens
at
the
louvre
said
de
malfort
noting
her
upward
gaze
for
we
allow
his
elaborate
glorification
of
his
grandfather
and
grandmother
about
half
a
mile
of
wall
but
i
forgot
you
have
not
seen
paris
nor
those
acres
of
gaudy
colouring
which
vanity
inflicted
upon
us
florentine
marie
with
her
carnation
cheeks
and
opulent
shoulders
the
b√©arnais
with
his
pointed
beard
and
stiff
ruff
mon
dieu
how
the
world
has
changed
since
ravaillac
knife
snapped
that
valiant
life
and
you
have
never
seen
paris
you
look
about
you
with
eyes
and
take
this
crowd
this
ceiling
those
candlebra
for
splendour
can
there
be
a
scene
more
splendid
asked
angela
pleased
to
keep
him
by
her
side
rather
than
see
him
devote
himself
to
her
sister
grateful
for
his
attention
in
that
crowd
where
most
people
were
strangers
and
where
lord
fareham
had
not
vouchsafed
the
slightest
notice
of
her
when
you
have
seen
the
louvre
you
will
wonder
that
any
king
with
a
sense
of
his
own
consequence
in
the
world
can
inhabit
such
a
hovel
as
whitehall
this
congeries
of
shabby
apartments
the
offices
of
servants
the
lodgings
of
followers
and
dependents
soldiers
and
civilians
huddled
in
a
confused
labyrinth
of
brick
and
stone
redeemed
from
squalor
only
by
one
fine
room
could
you
see
the
grand
proportions
the
colossal
majesty
of
the
great
henri
palace
that
palace
whose
costly
completion
sat
heavy
upon
sully
careful
soul
henri
loved
to
build
and
his
grandson
louis
inherits
that
augustan
taste
you
were
telling
us
of
a
new
palace
at
versailles
a
royal
city
in
stone
white
dazzling
grandiose
the
mortar
was
scarcely
dry
when
i
was
there
in
march
but
you
should
have
seen
the
ball
the
finest
masquerade
that
was
ever
beheld
in
europe
all
paris
came
in
masks
to
see
that
magnificent
spectacle
his
majesty
allowed
entrance
to
all
and
those
who
came
were
feasted
at
a
banquet
which
only
rabelais
could
fairly
describe
and
then
with
our
splendour
there
is
an
elegant
restraint
a
decency
unknown
here
compare
these
women
lady
shrewsbury
yonder
lady
chesterfield
the
fat
woman
in
and
silver
lady
castlemaine
brazen
in
orange
velvet
and
emeralds
compare
them
with
cond√©
sister
with
the
duchesse
de
bouillon
the
princess
palatine
are
those
such
good
women
humph
they
are
ladies
these
are
the
kind
of
women
king
charles
admires
they
are
as
distinct
a
race
as
the
dogs
that
lie
in
his
and
follow
him
in
his
walks
a
species
of
his
own
creation
they
do
not
even
affect
modesty
but
i
am
turning
preacher
like
fareham
come
there
is
to
be
an
entertainment
in
the
theatre
roxalana
has
returned
to
the
stage
and
jacob
hall
the
is
to
perform
they
followed
the
crowd
and
de
malfort
remained
at
angela
side
till
the
end
of
the
performance
and
attended
her
to
the
afterwards
fareham
watched
them
from
his
place
in
the
background
he
stood
ever
aloof
from
the
royal
focus
the
beauty
and
the
wit
the
most
dazzling
jewels
the
most
splendid
raiment
he
was
amidst
the
court
but
not
of
it
yes
the
passion
which
these
two
entertained
for
each
other
was
patent
to
every
eye
but
had
it
been
an
honourable
attachment
upon
de
malfort
side
he
would
have
declared
himself
before
now
he
would
not
have
abandoned
the
field
to
such
a
sober
suitor
as
denzil
henri
de
malfort
loved
her
and
she
fed
his
passion
with
her
sweetest
smiles
the
low
and
tender
tones
of
the
most
musical
voice
fareham
had
ever
listened
to
the
voice
that
came
to
me
in
my
desolation
the
sweetest
sound
that
ever
fell
on
a
dying
man
ear
he
thought
recalling
those
solitary
days
and
nights
in
the
plague
year
recalling
those
vanished
hours
with
a
fond
longing
that
arm
which
shows
dazzling
white
against
the
purple
velvet
of
his
sleeve
is
the
arm
that
held
up
my
aching
head
in
the
dawn
of
returning
reason
those
are
the
eyes
that
looked
down
upon
mine
so
pitiful
so
anxious
for
my
recovery
oh
lovely
angel
i
would
be
a
leper
again
a
wretch
only
to
drink
a
cup
of
water
from
that
dear
hand
only
to
feel
the
touch
of
those
light
fingers
on
my
forehead
there
was
a
magic
in
that
touch
that
surpassed
the
healing
powers
of
kings
there
was
a
light
as
of
heaven
in
those
benignant
eyes
but
oh
she
is
changed
since
then
she
is
with
the
contagion
of
a
profligate
age
her
wings
are
scorched
by
the
fire
of
this
modish
tophet
she
has
been
taught
to
dress
and
look
like
the
women
around
her
a
little
more
modest
but
after
the
same
fashion
the
nun
i
worshipped
is
no
more
some
one
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
with
an
ostrich
fan
he
turned
and
saw
lady
castlemaine
close
at
his
elbow
image
of
gloom
will
you
lead
me
to
my
rooms
she
asked
in
a
curious
voice
her
dark
blue
eyes
deepened
by
the
pallor
that
showed
through
her
rouge
i
shall
esteem
myself
too
much
honoured
by
that
office
he
answered
as
she
took
his
arm
and
moved
quickly
with
hurried
footsteps
through
the
lessening
throng
oh
there
is
no
one
to
dispute
the
honour
with
you
sometimes
i
have
a
mob
to
hustle
me
to
my
lodgings
borne
on
the
current
of
their
adulation
sometimes
i
move
through
a
desert
as
i
do
your
face
attracted
me
for
i
believe
it
is
the
only
one
at
whitehall
as
gloomy
as
my
own
unless
there
are
some
of
my
creditors
men
to
whom
i
owe
gaming
debts
it
was
curious
to
note
that
subtle
change
in
the
faces
of
those
they
passed
which
barbara
palmer
knew
so
well
faces
that
changed
obedient
to
the
weathercock
of
royal
caprice
the
countenances
of
courtiers
who
even
yet
had
not
learnt
justly
to
weigh
the
influence
of
that
imperial
favourite
or
to
understand
that
she
ruled
their
king
with
a
power
which
no
transient
fancy
for
newer
faces
could
undermine
a
day
or
two
in
the
sulks
frowns
and
mournful
looks
for
gossip
pepys
to
jot
down
in
his
diary
and
the
next
day
the
sun
would
be
shining
again
and
the
king
would
be
at
supper
with
the
lady
perhaps
lady
castlemaine
knew
that
her
empire
was
secure
but
she
took
these
transient
fancies
her
jealous
soul
could
tolerate
no
rival
or
it
may
be
that
she
really
loved
the
king
he
had
given
himself
to
her
in
the
flush
of
his
triumphant
return
while
he
was
still
young
enough
to
feel
a
genuine
passion
for
her
sake
he
had
been
a
cruel
husband
an
insolent
tyrant
to
an
inoffensive
wife
for
her
sake
he
had
squandered
his
people
money
and
outraged
every
moral
law
and
it
may
be
that
she
remembered
these
things
and
hated
him
the
more
fiercely
for
them
when
he
was
inconstant
she
was
a
woman
of
extremes
in
whose
tropical
temperament
there
was
no
medium
between
hatred
and
love
you
will
sup
with
me
fareham
she
said
as
he
waited
on
the
threshold
of
her
lodgings
which
were
in
a
detached
pile
of
buildings
near
the
holbein
gateway
and
looking
upon
an
enclosed
and
somewhat
gloomy
garden
your
ladyship
will
excuse
me
i
am
expected
at
home
what
devil
perhaps
you
think
i
am
inviting
you
to
a
i
shall
have
some
company
though
the
drove
have
gone
to
the
stewarts
in
a
hope
of
getting
asked
to
supper
which
but
a
few
of
them
can
realise
in
her
mean
lodgings
you
had
better
stay
i
may
have
buckhurst
sedley
de
malfort
and
a
few
more
of
the
pretty
fellows
enough
to
empty
your
pockets
at
basset
your
ladyship
is
all
goodness
said
fareham
quickly
de
malfort
name
had
decided
him
he
followed
his
hostess
through
a
crowd
of
lackeys
a
splendour
of
wax
candles
to
her
saloon
where
she
turned
and
flashed
upon
him
a
glorious
picture
of
mature
loveliness
her
complexion
the
peach
in
its
ripest
bloom
the
orange
sheen
of
her
velvet
mantua
shining
out
against
a
background
of
purple
damask
curtains
embroidered
with
gold
the
logs
blazed
and
roared
in
the
wide
chimney
warmth
opulence
hospitality
were
all
expressed
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
room
where
luxurious
fauteuils
after
the
new
french
fashion
stood
about
ready
to
receive
her
ladyship
guests
these
were
not
long
waited
for
there
was
no
crowd
less
than
twenty
men
and
about
a
dozen
women
were
enough
to
add
an
air
of
living
gaiety
to
the
brilliancy
of
light
and

malfort
was
the
last
who
entered
he
kissed
her
ladyship
hand
looked
about
him
and
recognised
fareham
with
open
wonder
an
israelite
in
the
house
of
dagon
he
said
as
he
approached
him
what
fareham
have
you
given
your
neck
to
the
yoke
do
you
yield
to
the
charm
which
has
subjugated
such
lighter
natures
as
villiers
and
buckhurst
it
is
only
human
to
love
variety
you
have
discovered
the
charm
of
youth
and
innocence
do
you
think
it
needs
a
modish
columbus
to
discover
that
we
all
worship
innocence
were
it
but
for
its
rarity
as
we
esteem
a
black
pearl
or
a
yellow
diamond
above
a
white
one
jarni
but
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
here
it
is
the
most
human
thing
i
have
known
of
you
since
you
recovered
of
the
contagion
for
you
have
been
a
gloomier
man
from
that
time
be
assured
i
am
altogether
human
at
least
upon
the
worser
side
of
humanity
how
dismal
you
look
upon
my
soul
fareham
you
should
fight
against
that
melancholic
habit
her
ladyship
is
in
the
black
sulks
we
are
in
for
a
pleasant
evening
yet
if
we
were
to
go
away
she
would
storm
at
us
call
us
sycophants
and
swear
she
would
hold
no
further
commerce
with
any
manjack
among
our
detestable
crew
well
she
is
a
magnificent
termagant
if
cleopatra
was
half
as
handsome
i
can
forgive
antony
for
following
her
to
ruin
at
actium
there
is
supper
in
the
gentlemen
said
lady
castlemaine
who
was
standing
near
the
fire
in
the
midst
of
a
knot
of
whispering
women
they
had
been
abusing
the
fair
frances
and
ridiculing
old
rowley
to
gratify
their
hostess
she
knew
them
by
heart
their
falsehood
and
hollowness
she
knew
that
they
were
ready
every
one
of
them
to
steal
her
royal
lover
had
they
but
the
chance
of
such
a
conquest
yet
it
solaced
her
soreness
to
hear
miss
stewart
depreciated
even
by
those
false
lips
she
was
too
tall
her
britannia
profile
looked
as
if
it
was
cut
out
of
wood
she
was
bold
bad
designing
it
was
she
who
would
have
the
king
not
the
king
who
would
have
her
you
are
too
malicious
my
dearest
price
said
lady
castlemaine
with
more
good
humour
than
had
been
seen
in
her
countenance
that
evening
buckhurst
will
you
take
price
to
supper
there
are
cards
in
the
gallery
pray
amuse
yourselves
but
will
your
ladyship
neither
sup
nor
play
asked
sedley
my
ladyship
has
a
raging
headache
what
devil
did
i
not
lose
enough
to
some
of
you
blackguards
last
night
do
you
want
to
rook
me
again
pray
amuse
yourselves
friends
no
doubt
his
majesty
is
being
exquisitely
entertained
where
he
is
but
i
doubt
if
he
will
get
as
good
a
supper
as
you
will
find
in
the
next
room
the
significant
laugh
which
concluded
her
speech
was
too
angry
for
mirth
and
the
blackness
of
her
brow
forbade
questioning
all
the
town
knew
next
day
that
she
had
contrived
to
get
the
royal
supper
intercepted
and
carried
off
on
its
way
from
the
king
kitchen
to
miss
stewart
lodgings
and
that
his
majesty
had
a
barmecide
feast
at
the
table
of
beauty
it
was
a
joke
quite
in
the
humour
of
the
age
the
company
melted
out
of
the
room
all
but
fareham
who
watched
lady
castlemaine
as
she
stood
by
the
hearth
in
an
attitude
of
hopeless
leaning
against
the
lofty
sculptured
one
slender
foot
in
slipper
and
transparent
stocking
poised
on
the
brazen
fender
and
her
proud
eyelids
lowered
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
this
world
worth
looking
at
but
the
pile
of
ship
timber
burning
with
flames
upon
the
silver
andirons
in
spite
of
that
sullen
downward
gaze
she
was
conscious
of
lingering
why
do
you
stay
my
lord
she
asked
without
looking
up
if
your
purse
is
heavy
there
are
friends
of
mine
yonder
who
will
lighten
it
for
you
fairly
or
foully
i
have
never
made
up
my
mind
how
far
a
gentleman
may
be
a
rogue
with
impunity
if
you
do
love
losing
money
you
had
best
eat
a
good
supper
and
begone
i
thank
you
madam
i
am
more
in
the
mood
for
cards
than
for
feasting
she
did
not
answer
him
but
clasped
her
hands
suddenly
before
her
face
and
gave
a
sigh
fareham
paused
on
the
threshold
of
the
gallery
watching
her
and
then
went
slowly
back
bent
down
to
take
the
hand
that
had
dropped
at
her
side
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
it
silently
respectfully
with
a
kind
of
homage
that
had
become
strange
of
late
years
to
barbara
palmer
adorers
she
had
and
to
spare
toadeaters
and
flatterers
a
regiment
of
mercenaries
but
these
all
wanted
something
of
her
kisses
smiles
influence
money
disinterested
respect
was
new
i
thought
you
were
a
puritan
lord
fareham
i
am
a
man
and
i
know
what
it
is
to
suffer
the
of
jealousy
jealousy
yes
i
never
was
good
at
hiding
my
feelings
he
treats
me
shamefully
come
now
you
take
me
for
an
abandoned
profligate
woman
a
callous
wanton
that
is
what
the
world
takes
me
for
and
perhaps
i
have
deserved
no
better
of
the
world
but
whatever
i
am
was
he
made
me
so
if
he
had
been
true
i
could
have
been
constant
it
is
the
insolence
of
abandonment
that
stings
the
careless
slights
scarce
conscious
that
he
wounds
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
too
before
wretches
that
grin
and
whisper
and
prophesy
the
day
when
my
pride
shall
be
in
the
dust
it
is
treat
ment
such
as
this
that
makes
women
desperate
and
if
we
can
not
keep
him
we
love
we
make
believe
to
love
some
one
else
and
flaunt
our
fancy
in
the
deceiver
face
do
you
think
i
cared
for
buckingham
with
his
heart
of
ice
or
for
such
a
snipe
as
jermyn
or
for
a
no
fareham
there
has
been
more
of
rage
and
hate
than
of
passion
in
my
caprices
and
he
is
with
frances
stewart
she
sets
up
for
a
model
of
chastity
and
is
to
marry
richmond
next
month
but
we
know
fareham
we
know
women
who
ride
in
glass
coaches
should
not
throw
stones
i
will
have
charles
at
my
feet
again
i
will
have
my
foot
upon
his
neck
again
i
can
not
use
him
too
ill
for
the
pain
he
gives
me
there
go
go
why
did
you
tempt
me
to
lay
my
heart
bare
dearest
lady
believe
me
i
respect
your
candour
my
heart
bleeds
for
your
wrongs
so
beautiful
so
high
above
all
other
women
in
the
capacity
to
charm
ah
be
sure
such
loveliness
has
its
responsibilities
it
is
a
gift
from
heaven
and
to
hold
it
cheap
is
a
sin
there
is
nothing
in
this
life
can
be
held
too
cheap
beauty
love
all
trumpery
you
would
make
life
a
tragedy
it
is
a
farce
fareham
a
farce
and
all
our
pleasures
and
diversions
only
serve
to
make
us
forget
what
worms
we
are
there
go
to
cards
to
supper
as
you
please
i
am
going
to
my
to
rest
this
throbbing
head
i
may
return
and
take
a
hand
at
cards
perhaps
those
fellows
will
game
and
booze
till
daylight
fareham
opened
the
door
for
her
as
she
went
out
regal
in
port
and
air
she
had
moved
him
to
compassion
even
while
she
owned
herself
a
wanton
to
love
passionately
and
to
see
another
preferred
there
is
a
brotherhood
in
agony
that
brings
even
opposite
natures
into
sympathy
he
passed
into
the
gallery
a
long
low
room
hung
with
modern
tapestries
richly
coloured
voluptuous
in
design
clusters
of
wax
tapers
in
gilded
sconces
lit
up
those
paphian
pictures
there
were
several
tables
at
which
the
mixed
company
were
sitting
piles
of
the
new
guineas
fresh
from
his
majesty
mint
shone
in
the
at
some
tables
there
was
a
silent
absorption
in
the
game
which
argued
high
play
and
the
true
gambler
spirit
at
others
mirth
reigned
talk
laughter
animated
looks
one
of
the
noisiest
was
the
table
at
which
de
malfort
was
the
most
conspicuous
figure
his
periwig
the
highest
his
dress
the
most
sumptuous
his
breast
glittering
with
orders
his
companions
were
sir
ralph
masaroon
colonel
dangerfield
an
old
malignant
who
had
hibernated
during
the
protectorate
and
had
never
left
his
own
country
and
lady
lucretia
topham
a
visiting
acquaintance
of
hyacinth
come
here
fareham
cried
de
malfort
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
you
i
wager
lady
lucretia
will
pass
you
her
hand
and
thank
you
for
taking
it
lady
lucretia
is
glad
to
be
quit
of
such
dishonest
company
said
the
lady
tossing
her
cards
upon
the
table
and
rising
in
a
cloud
of
powder
and
perfume
and
a
flutter
of
lace
and
brocade
if
i
were
i
would
say
you
marked
the
cards
but
as
i
the
soul
of
good
nature
i
only
swear
you
are
the
luckiest
dog
in
london
you
are
the
soul
of
good
nature
and
i
am
the
luckiest
dog
in
the
universe
when
you
smile
upon
me
answered
de
malfort
without
looking
up
from
his
cards
as
the
lady
posed
herself
gracefully
at
the
back
of
his
chair
leaning
over
his
shoulder
to
watch
his
play
i
would
not
limit
the
area
to
any
city
however
big
fareham
seated
himself
in
the
chair
the
lady
had
vacated
and
gathered
up
the
cards
she
had
abandoned
he
took
a
handful
of
gold
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
on
the
table
at
his
elbow
all
with
a
somewhat
churlish
silence
that
escaped
notice
where
everybody
was
loquacious
de
malfort
went
on
fooling
with
lady
lucretia
whose
lovely
hand
and
arm
her
strongest
point
descended
upon
a
card
now
and
then
to
indicate
the
play
she
deemed
wisest
once
he
caught
the
hand
and
kissed
it
in
transit
wert
thou
as
wise
as
this
hand
is
fair
it
should
direct
my
play
but
it
is
only
a
woman
hand
and
points
the
way
to
perdition
fareham
had
been
losing
steadily
from
the
moment
he
took
up
lady
cards
and
his
pile
of
jacobuses
had
been
gradually
passed
over
to
de
malfort
side
of
the
table
he
had
emptied
his
pockets
and
had
scrawled
two
or
three
upon
scraps
of
paper
torn
from
a
yet
he
went
on
playing
with
the
same
immovable
countenance
the
room
had
emptied
itself
the
rest
of
the
visitors
leaving
earlier
than
their
usual
hour
in
that
hospitable
house
perhaps
because
the
hostess
was
missing
perhaps
because
the
royal
sun
was
shining
elsewhere
lackeys
handed
their
salvers
of
burgundy
and
bordeaux
and
the
players
refreshed
themselves
occasionally
with
a
brimmer
of
clary
but
no
wine
brightened
fareham
scowling
brow
or
changed
the
glooiay
intensity
of
his
outlook
my
cards
have
brought
your
lordship
bad
luck
said
lady
lucretia
who
watched
de
malfort
winnings
with
an
air
of
personal
interest
i
knew
my
risk
before
i
took
them
madam
when
an
englishman
plays
against
a
frenchman
he
is
a
fool
if
he
is
not
prepared
to
be
rooked
fareham
are
you
mad
cried
de
malfort
starting
to
his
feet
to
insult
your
friend
country
and
by
basest
implication
your
friend
i
see
no
friend
here
i
say
that
you
frenchmen
cheat
at
cards
on
principle
and
are
proud
of
being
cheats
i
have
heard
de
gramont
brag
of
having
lured
a
man
to
his
tent
and
fed
him
and
wined
him
and
fleeced
him
while
he
was
drunk
he
took
a
goblet
of
claret
from
the
lackey
who
brought
his
salver
emptied
it
and
went
on
hoarse
with
passion
to
the
marrow
of
your
bones
you
are
false
all
of
you
you
do
not
cog
your
dice
perhaps
but
you
bubble
your
friends
with
finesses
and
are
as
much
sharpers
at
heart
as
the
lowest
in
alsatia
you
empty
our
purses
and
cozen
our
women
with
twanging
guitars
and
jingling
rhymes
and
laugh
at
us
because
we
are
honest
and
trust
you
seducers
tricksters
poltroons
the
footman
was
at
de
malfort
elbow
now
he
snatched
a
tankard
from
the
salver
and
flung
the
contents
across
the
table
straight
at
face
this
bully
forces
me
to
spoil
his
point
de
venise
he
said
coolly
as
he
set
down
the
tankard
there
should
be
a
law
for
chaining
up
rabid
curs
that
have
run
mad
without
provocation
fareham
sprang
to
his
feet
black
and
terrible
but
with
a
savage
exultation
in
his
countenance
the
wine
poured
in
a
red
stream
from
his
cravat
but
had
not
touched
his
face
there
shall
be
something
redder
than
burgundy
spilt
before
we
have
done
he
said
sacre
nom
nous
sommes
tombes
dans
un
antre
de
betes
sauvages
exclaimed
masaroon
starting
up
and
anxiously
examining
the
skirts
of
his
brocade
coat
lest
that
sudden
deluge
had
caught
him
none
of
your
french
to
show
your
fine
breeding
growled
the
old
cavalier
fareham
you
deserved
the
insult
but
one
red
will
wash
out
another
i
with
your
lordship
and
i
with
de
malfort
said
masaroon
he
had
more
than
enough
provocation
gentlemen
gentlemen
no
bloodshed
cried
lady
lucretia
or
if
you
are
going
to
be
uncivil
to
each
other
for
god
sake
get
me
to
my
chair
i
have
a
husband
who
would
never
forgive
me
if
it
were
said
you
fought
for
my
sake
we
will
see
you
safely
disposed
of
madam
before
we
begin
our
business
said
colonel
dangerfield
bluntly
fareham
you
can
take
the
lady
to
her
chair
while
masaroon
and
i
discuss
particulars
there
is
no
need
of
a
discussion
interrupted
fareham
hotly
we
have
nothing
to
arrange
nothing
to
wait
for
time
the
present
place
the
garden
under
these
windows
weapons
the
swords
we
wear
we
shall
have
no
witnesses
but
the
moon
and
stars
it
is
the
dead
middle
of
the
night
and
we
have
the
world
all
to
ourselves
give
me
your
rapier
then
that
i
may
compare
it
with
the
count
you
are
satisfied
monsieur
is
you
that
are
the
offender
and
lord
fareham
has
the
choice
of
weapons
let
him
choose
i
will
fight
him
with
cannon
or
with
answered
de
malfort
lolling
back
in
his
chair
tilted
at
an
angle
of
and
drumming
a
gay
dance
tune
with
his
on
the
table
is
a
foolish
imbroglio
from
first
to
last
and
only
his
lordship
and
i
know
how
foolish
he
came
here
to
provoke
a
quarrel
and
i
must
indulge
him
come
lady
lucretia
he
turned
to
his
fair
friend
as
he
unbuckled
his
sword
and
flung
it
on
the
table
it
is
my
place
to
lead
you
to
your
chair
colonel
you
and
your
friend
will
find
me
below
stairs
in
front
of
the
holbein
gate
you
are
forgetting
your
winnings
remonstrated
the
lady
pointing
to
the
pile
of
gold
the
lackeys
will
not
forget
them
when
they
clear
the
room
answered
de
malfort
putting
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
leaving
the
money
on
the
table
ten
minutes
later
fareham
and
de
malfort
were
standing
front
to
front
in
the
glare
of
four
torches
held
by
a
brace
of
her
ladyship
lackeys
who
had
been
impressed
into
the
service
and
the
colder
light
of
a
moon
that
rode
high
in
the
of
a
wintry
heaven
there
was
not
a
sound
but
the
ripple
of
the
unseen
river
and
the
distant
cry
of
a
watchman
in
petty
france
till
the
clash
of
swords
began
it
was
decided
after
a
brief
parley
that
the
principals
only
should
fight
the
quarrel
was
private
the
seconds
placed
their
men
on
a
piece
of
level
turf
five
paces
apart
they
were
and
without
coat
or
vest
the
lace
ruffles
of
their
rolled
back
to
the
elbow
their
naked
arms
ghastly
white
their
faces
suggesting
ghost
or
devil
as
the
spectral
moonlight
or
the
flame
of
the
flambeaux
shone
upon
them
you
mean
business
so
we
may
sink
the
parade
of
the
fencing
saloon
said
dangerfield
advance
gentlemen
a
pity
murmured
masaroon
there
is
nothing
prettier
than
the
salute
la
dangerfield
handed
the
men
their
swords
they
were
nearly
similar
in
fashion
both
blades
with
needle
points
and
no
cutting
edge
furnished
with
and
in
the
italian
style
and
were
about
of
a
length
the
word
was
given
and
the
business
of
engagement
proceeded
slowly
and
warily
for
a
few
moments
that
seemed
minutes
and
then
the
blades
were
firmly
joined
in
carte
and
a
series
of
rapid
feints
began
de
malfort
having
a
slight
advantage
in
the
neatness
of
his
circles
and
the
swiftness
of
his
wrist
play
but
in
these
preliminary
lounges
and
parries
he
soon
found
he
needed
all
his
skill
to
dodge
his
opponent
point
for
blade
followed
his
own
steadily
and
strongly
through
every
turn
de
malfort
had
begun
the
fight
with
an
insolent
smile
upon
his
lips
the
smile
of
a
man
who
believes
himself
invincible
while
fareham
countenance
never
changed
from
the
black
anger
that
had
darkened
it
all
that
night
it
was
a
face
that
meant
death
a
man
who
had
never
been
a
duellist
who
had
raised
his
voice
sternly
against
the
practice
of
duelling
stood
there
intent
upon
bloodshed
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
his
purpose
the
quarrel
was
an
artificial
quarrel
the
object
was
murder
de
malfort
provoked
at
the
unexpected
strength
of
fareham
fence
attempted
a
partial
disarmament
after
the
deadly
continental
method
joining
his
opponent
blade
near
the
point
from
a
wide
circular
parry
he
made
a
rapid
thrust
in
seconde
carrying
his
forte
the
entire
length
of
fareham
blade
almost
wrenching
the
sword
from
his
grasp
and
then
in
the
next
instant
reaching
forward
to
his
fullest
stretch
he
lunged
at
his
enemy
breast
aiming
at
the
vital
region
of
the
heart
a
thrust
that
must
have
proved
fatal
had
not
fareham
sprung
aside
and
so
received
the
blow
where
the
sword
only
grazed
his
ribs
inflicting
a
that
showed
red
upon
the
whiteness
of
his
shirt
dangerfield
tore
off
his
cravat
and
wanted
to
bind
it
round
his
principal
waist
but
fareham
repulsed
him
and
lashed
into
hot
fury
by
the
frenchman
ruse
met
his
adversary
thrusts
with
a
deadly
purpose
which
drove
de
malfort
to
reckless
lunging
and
riposting
and
the
play
grew
fast
and
fierce
while
the
rattle
of
steel
seemed
never
likely
to
end
suddenly
timing
his
attack
to
the
fraction
of
a
second
fareham
dropped
on
his
left
knee
and
planting
his
left
hand
upon
the
ground
sent
a
murderous
thrust
home
under
de
malfort
guard
whose
blade
passed
harmlessly
over
his
adversary
head
as
he
crouched
on
the
sward
de
malfort
fell
heavily
in
the
arms
of
the
two
seconds
who
both
sprang
to
his
assistance
is
it
fatal
asked
fareham
standing
motionless
as
stone
while
the
other
men
knelt
on
either
side
of
de
malfort
i
run
for
a
surgeon
said
masaroon
there
a
fellow
i
know
of
this
side
the
abbey
mends
bloody
noses
and
paints
black
eyes
and
he
was
off
running
across
the
grass
to
the
nearest
gate
it
looks
plaguily
like
a
coffin
dangerfield
answered
with
his
hand
on
the
wounded
man
breast
there
throbbing
here
yet
but
he
may
bleed
to
death
like
poor
lindsey
before
surgery
can
help
him
you
had
better
run
fareham
take
horse
to
dover
and
get
across
to
calais
or
ostend
you
were
devilish
provoking
it
might
go
hard
with
you
if
he
was
to
die
i
shall
not
budge
dangerfield
did
you
hear
me
say
i
wanted
to
kill
him
you
might
guess
i
did
care
a
cast
of
the
dice
for
my
life
when
i
said
as
much
let
them
find
it
murder
and
hang
me
i
wanted
him
out
of
the
world
and
do
care
how
soon
i
follow
you
are
mad
stark
staring
mad
the
wounded
man
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
groaning
aloud
in
the
agony
of
movement
and
beckoned
fareham
who
knelt
down
beside
him
all
of
a
piece
like
a
stone
figure
fareham
you
had
better
run
i
have
powerful
friends
there
be
an
ugly
stir
if
i
die
of
this
bout
kiss
me
mon
ami
i
forgive
you
i
know
what
wound
rankled
was
for
your
wife
sister
you
fought
not
the
cards
he
sank
into
dangerfield
arms
swooning
from
loss
of
blood
as
masaroon
came
back
at
a
run
bringing
a
surgeon
an
elderly
man
of
that
alsatian
class
which
is
to
be
found
out
of
bed
in
the
small
hours
he
brought
styptics
and
bandages
and
at
once
set
about
staunching
the
wound
while
this
was
happening
a
curtain
had
been
suddenly
pulled
aside
at
an
upper
window
in
lady
castlemaine
lodgings
showing
a
light
within
the
window
was
thrown
open
and
a
figure
appeared
clad
in
a
white
satin
that
glistened
in
the
moonlight
with
a
deep
collar
of
ermine
from
which
the
handsomest
face
in
london
looked
across
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
fareham
the
seconds
and
the
surgeon
were
grouped
about
de
malfort
it
was
lady
castlemaine
she
leant
out
of
the
window
and
called
to
them
what
has
happened
is
any
one
hurt
i
wager
a
thousand
pounds
you
devils
have
been
fighting
de
malfort
is
stabbed
masaroon
answered
not
dead
she
shrieked
leaning
farther
out
of
the
window
no
but
it
looks
dangerous
bring
him
into
my
house
this
instant
i
send
my
fellows
to
help
have
you
sent
for
a
surgeon
the
surgeon
is
here
the
radiant
figure
vanished
like
a
vision
in
the
skies
and
in
three
minutes
a
door
was
heard
opening
and
a
voice
calling
john
william
hugh
peter
every
manjack
of
you
lazy
devils
there
been
no
time
for
you
to
fall
asleep
since
the
company
left
stir
yourselves
vermin
and
out
with
you
we
had
best
levant
fareham
muttered
dangerfield
and
drew
away
his
principal
who
went
with
him
silent
and
unresisting
having
no
more
to
do
there
not
to
fly
the
country
however
but
to
walk
quietly
home
to
fareham
house
and
to
let
himself
in
at
the
garden
door
known
to
the
household
as
his
lordship
chapter
xviii
revelations
lord
fareham
stayed
in
his
own
house
by
the
thames
and
nobody
interfered
with
his
liberty
though
henri
de
malfort
lay
for
nearly
a
fortnight
between
life
and
death
and
it
was
only
in
the
beginning
of
december
that
he
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
and
was
able
to
be
removed
from
lady
castlemaine
luxurious
rooms
to
his
own
lodgings
might
have
made
much
talk
of
his
lying
ill
in
her
ladyship
house
and
being
tenderly
nursed
by
her
had
not
lady
castlemaine
outlived
the
possibility
of
slander
it
would
have
been
as
difficult
for
her
name
to
acquire
any
blacker
stain
as
for
a
damaged
reputation
to
wash
itself
white
the
secret
of
the
encounter
had
been
faithfully
kept
by
principals
and
seconds
de
malfort
behaving
with
a
chivalrous
generosity
he
appeared
indeed
as
anxious
for
his
antagonist
safety
as
for
his
own
recovery
it
was
a
mistake
he
said
when
masaroon
pressed
him
with
home
questions
every
man
is
mad
once
in
his
life
fareham
madness
took
an
angry
turn
against
an
old
friend
why
we
slept
under
the
same
blanket
in
the
trenches
before
dunkirk
we
rode
shoulder
to
shoulder
through
the
rain
of
bullets
at
chitillon
and
to
pick
a
trumpery
quarrel
with
a
i
wonder
the
quarrel
was
not
picked
earlier
masaroon
answered
bluntly
your
courtship
of
the
gentleman
wife
has
been
notorious
for
the
last
five
years
call
it
not
courtship
ralph
lady
fareham
and
i
are
old
playfellows
we
were
reared
in
the
du
loveland
the
kingdom
of
innocent
attachments
and
pure
penchants
that
country
of
which
mademoiselle
scud√©ry
has
given
us
laws
and
a
map
your
vulgar
london
lover
can
not
understand
platonics
the
affection
which
is
satisfied
with
a
smile
or
a
madrigal
fareham
knows
his
wife
and
me
better
than
to
doubt
us
and
yet
he
acted
like
a
man
who
was
madly
jealous
his
rudeness
at
the
was
obvious
malice
he
came
resolved
to
quarrel
ay
he
came
to
quarrel
but
not
about
his
wife
pressed
to
explain
this
dubious
phrase
de
malfort
affected
a
fit
of
languor
and
would
talk
no
more
the
town
was
told
that
the
comte
de
malfort
was
ill
of
a
quartain
fever
and
much
was
said
about
his
sufferings
during
the
fronde
his
exposure
to
damp
and
cold
in
the
by
dunkirk
his
rough
fare
and
hard
riding
through
the
war
of
the
princes
this
fever
which
hung
about
him
so
long
was
an
of
hardship
suffered
in
his
youth
privations
faced
with
a
boyish
recklessness
and
which
he
had
paid
for
with
an
impaired
constitution
fine
ladies
in
gilded
chairs
and
in
hackney
coaches
called
frequently
at
his
lodgings
in
james
street
to
inquire
about
his
progress
lady
fareham
private
messenger
was
at
his
door
every
morning
and
brought
a
note
or
a
book
or
a
piece
of
new
music
from
her
ladyship
who
had
been
sternly
forbidden
to
visit
her
old
friend
in
person
you
grow
every
day
a
gloomier
tyrant
hyacinth
protested
with
more
passion
in
her
voice
and
mien
than
ever
her
husband
had
known
why
should
i
not
go
to
him
when
he
is
ill
dangerously
ill
dying
perhaps
he
is
my
old
old
friend
i
remember
no
joy
in
life
that
he
did
not
share
why
should
i
not
go
to
him
in
his
sorrow
because
you
are
my
wife
and
i
forbid
you
i
can
not
understand
this
passion
i
thought
you
suffered
the
company
of
that
fop
as
you
suffered
your
the
trivial
appendage
of
a
fine
lady
state
had
i
supposed
that
there
was
anything
serious
in
your
liking
that
you
could
think
him
worth
anger
or
tears
should
have
ordered
your
life
differently
and
he
would
have
had
no
place
in
it
tyrant
tyrant
you
astound
me
hyacinth
would
you
dispute
the
favours
of
a
fop
with
your
young
sister
with
my
sister
she
cried
scornfully
ay
with
your
sister
whom
he
has
courted
assiduously
but
with
no
honourable
motive
i
have
seen
his
designs
well
perhaps
you
are
right
he
may
care
for
angela
and
think
her
too
poor
to
marry
he
is
a
traitor
and
a
villain
oh
what
fury
marry
my
sister
to
sir
denzil
and
then
she
will
be
safe
from
all
pursuit
he
will
bury
her
alive
in
oxfordshire
withdraw
her
for
ever
from
this
wicked
town
like
poor
lady
yarborough
in
cornwall
i
will
never
ask
her
to
marry
a
man
she
can
not
love
why
not
are
not
you
and
i
a
happy
couple
and
how
much
love
had
we
for
each
other
before
we
married
why
i
scarce
knew
the
colour
of
your
eyes
and
if
i
had
met
you
in
the
street
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
recognised
you
and
now
after
thirteen
years
of
matrimony
we
are
at
our
first
quarrel
and
that
no
lasting
one
come
fareham
be
pleasant
and
yielding
let
me
go
and
see
my
old
playfellow
i
am
heartbroken
for
lack
of
his
company
for
fear
of
his
death
she
hung
upon
him
coaxingly
the
bright
blue
eyes
looking
up
at
him
eyes
that
had
so
often
been
compared
to
madame
de
longueville
eyes
that
had
smiled
and
beamed
in
many
a
song
and
madrigal
by
the
parlour
poets
of
the
h√¥tel
de
rambouillet
she
was
exquisitely
pretty
in
her
youthful
colouring
of
lilies
and
roses
blue
eyes
and
pale
gold
hair
and
retained
at
thirty
almost
all
the
charms
and
graces
of
eighteen
fareham
took
her
by
both
hands
and
held
her
away
from
him
severely
scrutinising
a
face
which
he
had
always
been
able
to
admire
as
calmly
as
if
it
had
been
on
canvas
you
look
like
an
innocent
woman
he
said
and
i
have
always
believed
you
a
good
woman
and
have
trusted
my
honour
in
your
keeping
have
seen
that
man
fawning
at
your
feet
singing
and
sighing
in
your
ear
and
have
thought
no
evil
but
now
that
you
have
told
me
as
plainly
as
woman
can
speak
to
man
that
this
is
the
man
you
love
and
have
loved
all
your
life
there
must
needs
come
an
end
to
the
sighing
and
singing
you
and
henri
de
malfort
must
meet
no
more
nay
look
not
such
angry
scorn
i
impute
no
guilt
but
between
innocence
and
guilt
there
need
be
but
one
passionate
hour
the
wife
goes
out
an
honest
woman
able
to
look
her
husband
in
the
face
as
you
are
looking
at
me
the
wanton
comes
home
and
the
rest
of
her
life
is
a
shameful
lie
and
the
husband
awakes
some
day
from
his
dream
of
domestic
peace
to
discover
that
he
has
been
long
the
of
the
town
i
will
be
no
such
fatuous
husband
hyacinth
i
will
wait
for
no
second
warning
lady
fareham
submitted
in
silence
and
with
deep
resentment
she
had
never
before
experienced
a
husband
authority
sternly
exercised
she
had
been
forbidden
the
free
run
of
london
and
some
of
the
pleasures
of
court
society
but
then
she
had
been
denied
with
all
kindness
and
had
been
allowed
so
many
counterbalancing
extravagances
pleasures
and
follies
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
her
to
think
herself
she
submitted
angrily
passionately
regretting
the
man
whose
presence
had
long
been
the
brightest
element
in
her
life
her
cheek
paled
she
grew
indifferent
to
the
amusements
which
had
been
her
sole
occupation
she
sulked
in
her
rooms
equally
avoiding
her
children
and
their
aunt
and
indeed
seemed
to
care
for
no
one
society
except
lewin
the
court
milliner
had
business
with
her
ladyship
every
day
and
was
regaled
with
cakes
and
liqueurs
in
her
ladyship
you
must
be
very
busy
about
new
gowns
hyacinth
her
husband
said
to
her
one
day
at
dinner
i
meet
the
harridan
from
covent
garden
on
the
stairs
every
morning
she
is
not
a
harridan
whatever
that
elegant
word
may
mean
and
as
for
gowns
it
would
be
wiser
for
me
to
order
no
new
ones
since
it
is
but
likely
i
shall
soon
have
to
wear
mourning
for
an
old
friend
she
looked
at
her
husband
defying
him
he
rose
from
the
table
with
a
sigh
and
walked
out
of
the
room
there
was
war
between
them
or
at
best
an
armed
neutrality
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
he
had
been
blind
to
the
things
he
should
have
seen
dull
and
unobservant
where
he
should
have
had
sense
and
understanding
i
did
not
care
enough
for
my
honour
he
thought
was
it
because
i
cared
too
little
for
my
wife
it
is
indifference
and
not
love
that
is
blind
angela
saw
the
cloud
that
overshadowed
fareham
house
with
deepest
distress
and
yet
felt
herself
powerless
to
bring
back
sunshine
her
sister
met
her
remonstrances
with
scorn
do
you
take
the
part
of
a
tyrant
against
your
own
flesh
and
blood
she
asked
i
have
been
too
tame
a
slave
to
keep
me
away
from
the
court
while
i
was
young
and
worth
looking
at
to
deny
me
amusements
and
admiration
which
are
the
privilege
of
every
woman
of
quality
to
forbid
me
the
and
make
a
country
cousin
of
me
by
keeping
me
ignorant
of
modern
wit
i
am
ashamed
of
my
compliance
nay
dearest
was
it
not
an
evidence
of
his
love
that
he
should
desire
you
to
keep
your
mind
pure
as
well
as
your
face
fair
no
he
has
never
loved
me
it
is
only
a
churlish
jealousy
that
would
shut
me
up
in
a
harem
like
a
turk
wife
and
part
me
from
the
friend
i
like
best
in
the
world
with
the
purest
platonic
affection
hyacinth
do
be
angry
with
me
for
being
out
of
the
fashion
but
indeed
i
can
not
think
it
right
for
a
wife
to
care
for
the
company
of
any
other
man
but
her
husband
and
my
husband
is
so
entertaining
sure
any
woman
might
be
content
with
such
gay
company
such
flashes
of
wit
such
light
raillery
cried
hyacinth
scornfully
walking
up
and
down
the
room
plucking
at
the
lace
upon
her
sleeves
with
restless
hands
her
bosom
heaving
her
eyes
with
anger
since
his
sickness
last
year
he
has
been
the
image
of
melancholy
he
has
held
himself
aloof
from
me
as
if
had
had
the
pestilence
i
was
content
that
it
should
be
so
i
had
my
children
and
you
and
one
who
loved
me
better
in
his
light
way
than
any
of
you
and
i
could
do
without
lord
fareham
but
now
he
forbids
me
to
see
an
old
friend
that
is
dangerously
ill
and
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
boils
in
rebellion
against
his
tyranny
it
was
in
the
early
dusk
an
hour
or
so
after
dinner
angela
sat
silent
in
the
shadow
of
a
bay
window
quite
as
as
her
sister
sorry
for
hyacinth
but
still
sorrier
for
hyacinth
husband
yet
feeling
that
there
was
treachery
and
unkindness
in
making
him
first
in
her
thoughts
but
surely
surely
he
deserved
a
better
wife
than
this
surely
he
deserved
a
wife
love
this
man
who
stood
alone
among
the
men
she
knew
hating
all
evil
things
honouring
all
things
good
and
noble
he
had
been
unkind
to
her
cold
and
cruel
since
that
fatal
night
he
had
let
her
understand
that
all
friendship
between
them
was
at
an
end
for
ever
and
that
she
had
become
despicable
in
his
sight
and
she
had
submitted
to
be
scorned
by
him
since
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
clear
herself
she
had
made
her
sisterly
sacrifice
for
a
sister
who
regarded
it
very
lightly
to
whose
light
fancy
that
night
and
all
it
involved
counted
but
as
a
scene
in
a
comedy
and
she
could
not
unmake
it
but
having
so
sacrificed
his
good
opinion
whose
esteem
she
valued
she
wanted
to
see
some
happy
result
and
to
save
this
splendid
home
from
shipwreck
suddenly
with
a
passionate
impulse
she
went
to
her
sister
and
put
her
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
hyacinth
you
shall
not
continue
in
this
folly
she
cried
to
fret
for
that
shallow
idler
whose
love
is
lighter
than
thistledown
whose
element
is
the
ruelle
of
one
of
those
libertine
french
duchesses
he
is
ever
talking
about
to
rebel
against
the
noblest
gentleman
in
england
oh
sister
you
must
know
him
better
than
i
do
and
yet
i
who
am
nothing
to
him
am
wretched
when
i
see
him
indeed
hyacinth
you
are
acting
like
a
wicked
wife
you
should
never
have
wished
to
see
de
malfort
again
after
the
peril
of
that
night
you
should
have
known
that
he
had
no
esteem
for
you
that
he
was
a
traitor
that
his
design
was
the
wickedest
cruellest
i
do
pretend
to
know
a
man
mind
as
well
as
you
neither
de
nor
my
husband
you
have
needed
but
the
experience
of
a
year
to
make
you
wise
enough
in
the
world
ways
to
instruct
your
elders
i
am
not
going
to
be
preached
to
hark
she
cried
running
to
the
nearest
window
and
looking
out
at
the
river
that
is
better
than
your
sermons
it
was
the
sound
of
fiddles
playing
the
symphony
of
a
song
she
knew
well
one
of
de
malfort
a
french
chanson
her
latest
favourite
the
words
adapted
from
a
little
poem
by
voiture
pour
vos
beaux
yeux
she
opened
the
casement
and
angela
stood
beside
her
looking
down
at
a
boat
in
which
several
muffled
figures
were
seated
and
which
was
moored
to
the
terrace
wall
there
were
three
violins
and
a
and
a
quartette
of
with
fair
young
faces
smiling
in
the
light
of
the
lamps
that
hung
in
front
of
fareham
house
the
evening
was
still
and
mild
as
early
autumn
and
the
plash
of
oars
passing
up
and
down
the
river
sounded
like
a
part
of
the
music
love
in
her
sunny
eyes
doth
basking
play
love
walks
the
pleasant
mazes
of
her
hair
love
does
on
both
her
lips
for
ever
stray
and
sows
and
reaps
a
thousand
kisses
there
in
all
her
outward
parts
love
always
seen
but
oh
he
never
went
within
it
was
a
song
of
cowley
which
de
malfort
had
lately
set
to
music
and
to
a
melody
which
hyacinth
especially
admired
a
serenade
only
de
malfort
could
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
lying
ill
and
alone
he
sends
me
the
sweetest
token
of
his
regard
my
favourite
air
his
own
setting
the
last
song
i
ever
heard
him
sing
and
you
wonder
that
i
value
so
pure
so
disinterested
a
love
protested
hyacinth
to
her
sister
in
the
silence
at
the
end
of
the
song
sing
again
sweet
boys
sing
again
she
cried
snatching
a
purse
from
her
pocket
and
flinging
it
with
impetuous
aim
into
the
boat
it
hit
one
of
the
fiddlers
on
the
head
and
there
was
a
laugh
and
in
a
trice
the
largesse
was
divided
and
pocketed
they
are
from
his
majesty
choir
i
know
their
voices
said
hyacinth
so
fresh
and
pure
they
are
the
prettiest
singers
in
the
chapel
that
little
monkey
with
the
cherub
voice
is
purcell
blow
favourite
pupil
and
a
rare
genius
they
sang
another
song
from
de
malfort
repertoire
an
italian
serenade
which
hyacinth
had
heard
in
the
brilliant
days
before
her
marriage
when
the
italian
opera
was
still
a
new
thing
in
paris
the
melody
brought
back
the
memory
of
her
happy
girlhood
with
a
rush
of
sudden
tears
the
little
concert
lasted
for
something
less
than
an
hour
with
intervals
of
light
music
dances
and
marches
between
the
singing
boats
passed
and
repassed
strange
voices
joined
in
a
refrain
now
and
then
and
the
sisters
stood
at
the
open
window
enthralled
by
the
charm
of
the
music
and
the
scene
london
lay
in
ruins
yonder
to
the
east
and
sir
matthew
hale
and
other
judges
were
sitting
at
clifford
inn
to
decide
questions
of
title
and
boundary
and
the
obligation
to
rebuild
but
here
in
this
western
london
there
were
long
ranges
of
lighted
windows
shining
through
the
wintry
mists
wherries
passing
up
and
down
with
lanterns
at
their
prows
an
air
of
life
and
gaiety
hanging
over
that
river
which
had
carried
so
many
a
noble
victim
to
his
doom
yonder
where
the
four
towers
stood
black
against
the
starlit
greyness
unscathed
by
fire
and
untouched
by
time
the
last
notes
of
a
song
dwindled
and
died
to
the
accompaniment
of
dipping
oars
as
the
boat
moved
slowly
along
the
tideway
and
lost
itself
among
other
boats
jovial
cits
going
eastward
from
an
afternoon
at
the
king
theatre
modish
gallants
voyaging
westward
from
or
tavern
some
going
home
to
domesticity
others
intent
upon
pleasure
and
intrigue
as
the
darkness
came
down
and
the
hour
for
supper
and
deeper
drinking
drew
near
and
who
would
have
thought
watching
the
lighted
windows
of
palace
and
tavern
hearing
those
joyous
sounds
of
glee
or
catch
trolled
by
voices
that
reeked
of
wine
who
would
have
thought
of
the
and
the
unnumbered
dead
lying
in
the
pest
pits
yonder
or
the
city
in
ruins
or
the
king
enslaved
to
a
foreign
power
and
pledged
to
a
hated
church
london
gay
splendid
and
prosperous
the
of
the
world
as
she
seemed
to
those
who
loved
her
could
rise
glorious
from
the
ashes
of
a
fire
unparalleled
in
modern
history
and
to
charles
and
wren
it
might
be
given
to
realise
a
boast
which
in
augustus
had
been
little
more
than
an
imperial
phrase
chapter
xix
dido
the
armed
neutrality
between
man
and
wife
continued
and
the
domestic
sky
at
fareham
house
was
dark
and
depressing
lady
fareham
who
had
hitherto
been
remarkable
for
a
girlish
amiability
of
speech
which
went
well
with
her
girlish
beauty
became
now
the
height
of
the
mode
for
acidity
and
slander
the
worst
of
the
evil
speakers
on
her
ladyship
flavoured
the
china
tea
with
no
bitterer
allusions
than
those
that
fell
from
the
rosy
lips
of
the
hostess
and
for
the
colouring
of
those
lips
which
once
owed
their
vermeil
tint
only
to
nature
lady
fareham
was
now
dependent
upon
lewin
as
well
as
for
the
carnation
of
cheeks
that
looked
pallid
and
sunken
in
the
glass
which
reflected
the
sad
mourning
face
lewin
brought
roses
and
lilies
in
her
queer
little
china
pots
and
powder
boxes
pencils
and
brushes
perfumes
and
washes
without
number
it
cost
as
much
to
keep
a
complexion
as
to
keep
a
horse
and
lewin
was
infinitely
useful
at
this
juncture
since
she
called
every
day
at
james
street
to
carry
a
lace
cravat
or
a
ribbon
or
a
flask
of
essence
to
the
invalid
languishing
in
lodgings
there
and
visited
by
all
the
town
except
fareham
and
his
wife
de
malfort
had
lain
for
a
fortnight
at
lady
castlemaine
house
alternately
petted
and
neglected
by
his
fair
hostess
as
the
fit
took
her
since
she
showed
herself
ever
of
the
chameleon
breed
and
hovered
betwixt
angel
and
devil
his
surgeon
told
him
in
confidence
that
when
once
his
wound
was
healed
enough
to
allow
his
removal
the
sooner
he
quitted
that
feverish
company
the
better
it
would
be
for
his
chance
of
a
speedy
convalescence
so
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
he
was
moved
in
a
covered
litter
to
his
own
lodgings
where
his
faithful
valet
who
had
followed
his
fortunes
since
he
came
to
man
estate
was
quite
capable
of
nursing
him
the
town
soon
discovered
the
breach
between
lord
fareham
and
his
friend
a
breach
commented
upon
with
many
and
not
a
few
coarse
innuendoes
lady
lucretia
topham
insisted
upon
making
her
way
to
the
sick
man
room
in
the
teeth
of
messages
delivered
by
his
valet
which
even
to
a
less
intelligent
mind
than
lady
lucretia
might
have
conveyed
the
fact
that
she
was
not
wanted
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
by
de
bed
and
wept
and
raved
at
the
brutality
which
had
deprived
the
world
of
his
charming
company
and
herself
of
the
only
man
she
had
ever
loved
de
malfort
fevered
and
vexed
at
her
intrusion
and
at
this
renewal
of
fires
long
burnt
out
had
yet
discretion
enough
to
threaten
her
with
his
dire
displeasure
if
she
betrayed
the
secret
of
his
illness
i
have
sworn
dangerfield
and
masaroon
to
silence
he
said
except
servants
who
have
been
paid
to
keep
mute
you
are
the
only
other
witness
of
our
quarrel
and
if
the
story
becomes
town
talk
i
shall
know
whose
busy
tongue
set
it
going
and
then
well
there
are
things
i
might
tell
that
your
ladyship
would
hardly
like
the
world
to
know
traitor
if
your
purse
has
accommodated
me
once
in
a
way
when
luck
has
been
adverse
oh
madam
you
can
not
think
me
base
enough
to
blab
of
a
money
transaction
with
a
lady
there
are
secrets
more
tender
more
romantic
those
secrets
can
be
easily
denied
wretch
however
i
know
you
would
not
injure
me
with
a
husband
so
odious
and
tyrannical
that
i
stood
excused
in
advance
for
inconstancy
when
i
stooped
to
wed
country
manners
and
stubborn
ignorance
indeed
mon
ami
if
you
will
but
take
pains
to
recover
i
will
never
breathe
a
word
about
the
duel
but
if
if
a
sob
indicated
the
tragic
possibility
which
lady
lucretia
dared
not
put
into
words
i
will
do
all
that
a
weak
woman
can
do
to
get
fareham
hanged
for
murder
there
has
never
been
a
peer
hanged
in
england
i
believe
he
should
be
the
first
dear
soul
there
need
be
no
hanging
i
have
been
on
the
mending
hand
for
a
week
or
my
doctors
would
not
have
let
you
upstairs
there
go
my
pretty
lucr√®ce
but
if
your
milliner
or
your
shoemaker
is
pressing
there
are
a
few
jacobuses
in
the
drawer
of
yonder
escritoire
and
you
may
as
well
take
them
as
leave
them
for
my
valet
to
steal
he
is
one
of
those
excellent
old
servants
who
make
no
distinctions
and
he
robs
me
as
freely
as
he
robbed
my
father
before
me
lewin
is
always
pressing
sighed
lady
lucretia
she
made
me
a
gown
like
that
of
lady
fareham
for
which
you
were
all
eyes
i
ordered
the
brocade
to
please
you
and
now
i
am
wearing
it
when
you
are
not
at
whitehall
well
as
you
are
so
kind
i
will
be
your
debtor
for
another
trifling
loan
it
is
wicked
to
leave
money
where
it
tempts
a
good
servant
to
dishonesty
ah
henri
she
was
pocketing
the
gold
as
she
talked
if
ten
years
of
my
life
could
save
you
ten
days
of
pain
and
fever
how
gladly
would
i
give
them
to
you
ah
douce
if
there
were
a
market
for
the
exchange
of
such
commodities
what
a
roaring
trade
would
be
done
there
i
never
loved
a
woman
yet
but
she
offered
me
her
life
or
an
instalment
of
it
i
have
emptied
your
drawer
laughing
coyly
there
is
just
enough
to
keep
lewin
in
good
humour
till
you
are
well
again
and
we
can
be
partners
at
basset
it
will
be
very
long
before
i
play
basset
in
london
oh
but
indeed
you
will
soon
be
well
well
enough
to
change
the
scene
i
hope
it
needs
change
of
places
and
persons
to
make
life
bearable
i
long
to
be
at
the
louvre
again
to
see
a
play
by
moli√®re
company
as
only
they
can
act
instead
of
the
loathsome
translations
we
get
here
in
which
all
that
there
is
of
wit
and
charm
in
the
original
is
transmuted
to
coarseness
and
vulgarity
when
i
leave
this
bed
lucr√®ce
it
will
be
for
paris
why
it
will
be
ages
before
you
are
strong
enough
for
such
a
journey
oh
i
will
risk
that
i
hate
london
so
badly
that
to
escape
from
it
will
work
a
miraculous
cure
for
me
an
armed
neutrality
even
the
children
felt
the
change
in
the
atmosphere
of
home
and
nestled
closer
to
their
aunt
who
never
changed
to
them
father
mostly
looks
angry
henriette
complained
and
mother
is
always
unhappy
if
she
is
not
laughing
and
talking
in
the
midst
of
company
and
neither
of
them
ever
seems
to
want
me
i
wish
i
was
grown
up
so
that
i
could
be
maid
of
honour
to
the
queen
or
the
duchess
and
live
at
whitehall
mademoiselle
told
me
that
there
is
always
life
and
pleasure
at
court
your
father
does
not
love
the
court
dearest
and
mademoiselle
should
be
wiser
than
to
talk
to
you
of
such
things
when
she
is
here
to
teach
you
dancing
and
french
literature
mademoiselle
was
a
governess
lately
imported
from
paris
recommended
by
mademoiselle
scud√©ry
and
full
of
ideas
expressed
in
language
all
paris
had
laughed
at
moli√®re
but
the
pr√©cieuses
themselves
and
their
friends
protested
that
the
popular
farce
was
aimed
only
at
the
imitators
of
those
great
ladies
who
had
originated
the
school
of
superfine
culture
and
romantic
aspirations
sapho
herself
in
tracing
her
own
portrait
with
a
careful
and
elaborate
pencil
told
the
world
how
shamefully
she
had
been
imitated
by
the
spurious
saphos
who
set
up
their
salons
and
vied
with
the
sacred
house
of
rambouillet
and
the
privileged
coterie
of
the
rue
de
temple
lady
fareham
had
not
ceased
to
believe
in
her
dear
plain
witty
scud√©ry
and
was
delighted
to
secure
a
governess
of
her
choosing
whereby
papillon
who
loved
freedom
and
idleness
and
hated
lessons
of
all
kinds
was
set
down
to
write
themes
upon
chivalry
politeness
benevolence
pride
war
and
other
abstractions
or
to
fill
in
by
way
of
enlarging
her
acquaintance
with
the
french
language
which
she
had
chattered
freely
all
her
life
mademoiselle
insisted
upon
all
the
niceties
of
phraseology
as
discussed
in
the
rue
saint
thomas
du
louvre
there
had
been
a
change
of
late
in
fareham
manner
to
his
a
change
refreshing
to
her
troubled
spirit
as
mercy
that
gentle
dew
from
heaven
to
the
criminal
he
had
been
kinder
and
though
he
spent
very
few
of
his
hours
with
the
women
of
his
household
he
had
talked
to
angela
somewhat
in
the
friendly
tone
of
those
fondly
remembered
days
at
chilton
when
he
had
taught
her
to
row
and
ride
to
manage
a
spirited
palfrey
and
fly
a
falcon
and
had
been
in
all
things
her
mentor
and
friend
he
seemed
less
oppressed
with
gloom
as
time
went
on
but
had
his
sullen
fits
still
and
after
being
kind
and
courteous
to
wife
and
sister
and
playful
with
his
children
would
leave
them
suddenly
and
return
no
more
to
the
saloon
or
that
evening
yet
on
the
whole
the
sky
was
lightening
he
ignored
hyacinth
resentment
endured
her
pettishness
and
was
studiously
polite
to
her
it
was
on
lady
fareham
deep
in
that
very
severe
winter
that
some
news
was
told
her
which
came
like
a
and
which
it
needed
all
the
weak
soul
power
of
to
suffer
without
swooning
or
hysterics
lady
sarah
tewkesbury
gorgeous
in
velvet
and
fur
her
thickly
painted
countenance
framed
in
a
furred
hood
entered
fussily
upon
a
little
coterie
in
which
masaroon
vapouring
about
the
last
performance
at
the
theatre
was
the
principal
figure
there
was
a
little
woman
spoke
the
epilogue
he
said
a
little
creature
in
a
monstrous
big
hat
as
large
and
as
round
as
a
which
vastly
amused
his
majesty
the
hat
nay
it
was
woman
and
hat
the
thing
is
so
small
it
might
have
been
scarce
noticed
without
the
hat
but
it
has
a
pretty
little
insignificant
crumpled
face
and
laughs
all
over
its
face
till
it
has
no
eyes
and
then
stops
laughing
suddenly
and
the
eyes
shine
out
twinkling
and
dancing
like
stars
reflected
in
running
water
and
it
stamps
its
little
foot
upon
the
stage
in
a
comic
passion
and
it
sold
oranges
in
the
pit
folks
tell
me
a
year
ago
it
may
be
selling
sinecures
and
captaincies
in
a
year
or
two
and
putting
another
shilling
in
the
pound
upon
land
is
it
that
brazen
little
comedy
actress
you
are
talking
of
masaroon
lady
sarah
asked
when
she
had
exchanged
curtsies
with
the
ladies
of
the
company
and
established
herself
on
the
most
comfortable
tabouret
near
lady
fareham
glyn
wynn
gwyn
i
wonder
a
man
of
wit
can
notice
such
a
vulgar
creature
a
fit
only
to
please
the
rabble
in
the
gallery
ay
but
there
is
a
finer
sort
of
rabble
a
rabble
of
quality
beginning
with
his
majesty
that
are
always
pleased
with
anything
new
and
this
little
creature
is
as
fresh
as
a
spring
morning
to
see
her
laugh
to
hear
the
ring
of
it
clear
and
sweet
as
a
skylark
song
on
my
life
madam
the
town
has
a
new
toy
and
gwyn
will
be
the
rage
in
high
quarters
you
should
have
seen
castlemaine
scowl
when
rowley
laughed
and
ducked
under
the
box
almost
in
an
ecstasy
of
amusement
at
the
huge
hat
lady
castlemaine
brow
would
if
his
majesty
looked
at
a
fly
on
a
but
she
has
something
else
to
provoke
her
frowns
what
is
that
ch√®re
dame
asked
hyacinth
snatching
a
favourite
fan
from
sir
ralph
who
was
teasing
one
of
the
blenheims
with
african
feathers
that
were
almost
priceless
the
desertion
of
an
old
friend
the
comte
de
malfort
has
left
england
lady
fareham
turned
livid
under
her
rouge
angela
ran
to
her
and
leant
over
her
upon
a
pretence
of
rescuing
the
fan
and
chiding
the
dogs
and
so
contrived
to
screen
her
sister
change
of
complexion
from
the
malignity
of
her
dearest
friends
left
england
why
he
is
confined
to
his
bed
with
a
fever
hyacinth
said
faintly
when
she
had
somewhat
recovered
from
the
shock
nay
it
seems
that
he
began
to
go
abroad
last
week
but
would
see
no
company
except
a
confidential
friend
or
so
he
left
london
this
morning
for
dover
no
doubt
he
has
business
in
burgundy
where
his
estate
is
and
at
paris
where
he
is
of
importance
at
the
court
said
hyacinth
as
lightly
as
she
could
but
i
wager
anything
anybody
likes
that
he
will
be
in
london
again
in
a
month
i
take
you
for
those
black
pearls
in
your
ears
ma
mie
said
lady
sarah
his
furniture
is
to
be
sold
by
auction
next
week
i
saw
a
bill
on
the
house
this
afternoon
it
is
sudden
perhaps
the
castlemaine
had
become
too
exacting
castlemaine
faltered
hyacinth
agitated
beyond
her
power
of
why
what
is
she
to
him
more
than
she
is
to
other
men
very
little
perhaps
said
sir
ralph
and
then
everybody
laughed
and
hyacinth
felt
herself
sitting
among
them
like
a
child
understanding
nothing
of
their
smiles
and
shrugs
the
malice
in
their
sly
interchange
of
glances
she
sat
among
them
feeling
as
if
her
heart
were
turned
to
stone
he
had
left
the
country
without
even
bidding
her
farewell
her
faithful
slave
upon
whose
devotion
she
counted
as
surely
as
upon
the
rising
of
the
sun
whatever
her
husband
might
do
to
separate
her
from
this
friend
of
her
girlhood
she
had
feared
no
defection
upon
de
malfort
part
he
would
always
be
near
at
hand
waiting
and
watching
for
the
happier
days
that
were
to
smile
upon
their
innocent
loves
she
had
written
to
him
every
day
during
his
illness
good
lewin
had
taken
the
letters
to
him
and
had
brought
her
his
replies
he
had
not
written
so
often
or
at
such
length
as
she
and
had
pleaded
the
languor
of
convalescence
as
his
excuse
but
all
his
had
been
in
the
same
delicious
hyperbole
the
language
of
the
pays
du
tendre
she
sat
silent
while
her
visitors
talked
about
him
plucking
a
reputation
as
mercilessly
as
a
kitchen
wench
plucks
a
fowl
he
was
gone
he
had
left
the
country
deep
in
debt
it
was
his
landlord
who
had
stuck
up
that
notice
of
a
sale
by
auction
tailors
and
shoemakers
perruquiers
and
perfumers
were
bewailing
his
flight
so
much
for
the
sordid
side
of
things
but
what
of
those
numerous
affairs
of
the
heart
those
entanglements
which
had
made
his
life
one
long
intrigue
lady
sarah
sat
simpering
and
nodding
as
masaroon
whispered
close
in
her
ear
barbara
oh
that
was
almost
as
old
as
the
story
of
antony
and
cleopatra
she
had
paid
his
debts
and
he
had
paid
hers
their
purse
had
been
in
common
and
the
handsome
maid
of
honour
ah
poor
silly
soul
that
was
a
horrid
ugly
business
and
his
majesty
part
in
it
the
horridest
and
levington
the
rich
silk
mercer
wife
that
was
a
serious
attachment
it
was
said
that
the
husband
attempted
poison
when
de
malfort
refused
him
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
and
the
poor
woman
was
sent
to
die
of
and
rheumatism
in
a
castle
among
the
irish
bogs
where
her
citizen
husband
had
set
up
as
a
landed
squire
the
fine
company
discussed
all
these
foul
stories
with
gusto
insinuating
much
more
than
they
expressed
in
words
never
until
had
they
spoken
so
freely
of
de
malfort
in
lady
fareham
presence
but
the
story
had
got
about
of
a
breach
between
hyacinth
and
her
admirer
and
it
was
supposed
that
any
abuse
of
the
defaulter
would
be
pleasant
in
her
ears
and
then
he
was
ruined
and
gone
and
there
is
no
vulture
feast
sweeter
than
to
banquet
upon
a
departed
rival
character
hyacinth
listened
in
dull
silence
as
if
her
sensations
were
suddenly
benumbed
she
felt
nothing
but
a
horrible
surprise
her
lover
her
platonic
lover
that
other
half
of
her
mind
and
heart
with
whom
she
had
been
in
such
tender
sympathy
in
unison
of
spirit
so
subtle
that
the
same
thoughts
sprang
up
simultaneously
in
the
minds
of
each
the
same
language
leapt
to
their
lips
and
they
laughed
to
find
their
words
alike
it
had
been
only
a
shallow
woman
shallow
love
but
trivial
woes
are
tragedies
for
trivial
minds
and
when
her
guests
had
gradually
melted
away
dispersing
themselves
with
reciprocal
curtsies
and
airy
compliments
elegant
in
their
modish
iniquity
as
a
troop
of
vicious
fairies
hyacinth
stood
on
the
hearth
where
they
had
left
her
a
statue
of
despair
angela
went
to
her
when
the
stately
double
doors
had
closed
on
the
last
of
the
gossips
and
lackeys
and
they
two
were
alone
amidst
the
spacious
splendour
the
younger
sister
hugged
the
elder
to
her
breast
and
kissed
her
and
cried
over
her
like
a
mother
comforting
her
disappointed
child
do
heed
that
shameful
talk
dearest
no
character
is
safe
with
them
be
sure
monsieur
de
malfort
is
not
the
reprobate
they
would
make
him
you
have
known
him
nearly
all
your
life
you
know
him
too
well
to
judge
him
by
the
idle
talk
of
the
town
no
no
i
have
never
known
him
he
has
always
worn
a
mask
he
is
as
false
as
satan
do
talk
to
me
do
kiss
me
child
you
have
smeared
my
face
horribly
with
your
kisses
and
tears
your
pity
drives
me
mad
how
can
you
understand
these
things
you
who
have
never
loved
any
one
what
can
you
know
of
what
women
feel
there
silly
fool
you
are
trembling
as
if
i
had
hit
you
as
angela
withdrew
her
arms
suddenly
and
stood
aloof
i
have
been
a
virtuous
wife
sister
in
a
town
where
scarce
one
woman
in
ten
is
true
to
her
marriage
vows
i
have
never
sinned
against
my
husband
but
i
have
never
loved
him
henri
had
my
heart
before
i
knew
what
the
word
love
meant
and
in
all
these
years
we
have
loved
each
other
with
the
purest
noblest
affection
at
least
he
made
me
believe
my
love
was
reciprocated
we
have
enjoyed
a
most
exquisite
communion
of
thought
and
feeling
his
letters
you
shall
read
his
letters
some
day
so
noble
so
brilliant
all
poetry
and
chivalry
and
wit
i
lived
upon
his
letters
when
fate
parted
us
and
when
he
followed
us
to
england
i
thought
it
was
for
my
sake
that
he
came
only
for
me
and
to
hear
that
he
was
her
lover
hers
that
woman
to
know
that
he
came
to
me
with
sweetest
words
upon
his
lips
knelt
to
kiss
the
tips
of
my
fingers
as
if
it
were
a
privilege
to
die
for
from
her
arms
from
her
caresses
the
wickedest
woman
in
england
and
the
loveliest
dear
hyacinth
it
was
a
childish
dream
and
you
have
awakened
you
will
live
to
be
glad
of
being
recalled
from
falsehood
to
truth
your
husband
is
worth
fifty
de
malforts
did
you
but
know
it
oh
dearest
give
him
your
heart
who
ought
to
be
its
only
master
indeed
he
is
worthy
he
stands
apart
an
honourable
nobly
thinking
man
in
a
world
that
is
full
of
libertines
be
sure
he
deserves
your
love
do
preach
to
me
child
if
you
could
give
me
a
that
would
blot
out
memory
for
ever
make
me
forget
my
childhood
in
the
marais
my
youth
at
germain
the
dances
at
the
louvre
all
the
days
when
i
was
happiest
why
then
perhaps
you
might
make
me
in
love
with
lord
fareham
you
will
begin
a
new
life
sister
now
de
malfort
is
gone
i
will
never
forgive
him
for
going
cried
hyacinth
passionately
never
never
to
give
me
no
note
of
warning
to
sneak
away
like
a
thief
who
had
stolen
my
diamonds
to
fly
for
debt
too
and
not
come
to
me
for
money
why
have
i
a
fortune
if
not
to
help
those
i
love
but
if
he
was
that
woman
lover
i
will
never
see
his
face
again
never
speak
his
name
never
from
the
moment
i
am
convinced
of
that
hellish
treason
never
her
lover
lady
castlemaine
we
have
laughed
at
her
together
her
lover
and
there
were
other
women
those
spiteful
wretches
talked
about
just
now
a
tradesman
wife
oh
how
hateful
how
hateful
it
all
is
angela
if
it
is
true
i
shall
go
mad
dearest
to
you
he
was
but
a
friend
and
though
you
may
be
sorry
he
was
so
great
a
sinner
his
sins
can
not
concern
your
happiness
what
not
to
know
him
a
profligate
the
man
to
whom
i
gave
a
chaste
woman
love
angela
that
night
in
the
ruined
abbey
i
let
him
kiss
me
yes
for
one
moment
i
was
in
his
arms
and
his
lips
were
on
mine
and
he
had
kissed
her
the
same
night
perhaps
her
tainted
kisses
were
on
his
lips
and
it
was
you
who
saved
me
dear
sister
i
owe
you
more
than
life
i
might
have
given
myself
to
everlasting
shame
that
night
god
knows
i
was
in
his
power
her
lover
judging
all
women
perhaps
by
his
knowledge
of
that
the
epithet
which
closed
the
sentence
was
not
a
word
for
a
woman
lips
but
it
was
wrung
from
the
soreness
of
a
woman
wounded
heart
hyacinth
flung
herself
distractedly
into
her
sister
arms
you
saved
me
she
cried
hysterically
he
wanted
me
to
go
to
dover
with
him
back
to
france
where
we
were
so
happy
he
knelt
to
me
and
i
refused
him
but
he
prayed
me
again
and
again
and
if
you
had
not
come
to
rescue
me
should
i
have
gone
on
saying
no
god
knows
if
my
courage
would
have
held
out
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
swore
that
he
had
never
loved
any
one
upon
this
earth
as
he
loved
me
hypocrite
deceiver
liar
he
loved
that
woman
twenty
times
handsomer
than
ever
i
was
a
hundred
times
more
wicked
it
is
the
wicked
women
that
are
best
loved
angela
remember
that
oh
bless
you
for
coming
to
save
me
you
saved
fareham
life
in
the
plague
year
you
saved
me
from
everlasting
misery
you
are
our
guardian
angel
ah
dearest
if
love
could
guard
you
i
might
deserve
that
name
it
was
late
in
the
same
evening
that
lady
fareham
maid
came
to
her
to
inquire
if
she
would
be
pleased
to
see
lewin
who
had
brought
a
pattern
of
a
new
french
bodice
with
her
humble
apologies
for
waiting
on
her
ladyship
so
late
her
ladyship
would
see
lewin
she
started
up
from
the
sofa
where
she
had
been
lying
her
forehead
bound
with
a
handkerchief
steeped
in
hungary
water
she
was
all
excitement
bring
her
here
instantly
she
said
and
the
interval
necessary
to
conduct
the
milliner
up
the
grand
staircase
and
along
the
gallery
seemed
an
age
to
hyacinth
impatience
well
have
you
a
letter
for
me
she
asked
when
her
woman
had
retired
and
lewin
had
bustled
and
curtsied
across
the
room
in
truly
my
lady
and
i
have
to
ask
your
ladyship
pardon
for
not
bringing
it
early
this
morning
when
his
honour
gave
it
to
me
with
his
own
hand
out
of
travelling
carriage
and
very
white
and
wasted
he
looked
dear
gentleman
not
fit
for
a
voyage
to
france
in
this
severe
weather
and
i
was
to
carry
you
his
letter
immediately
but
eh
gud
your
ladyship
there
was
never
such
a
business
as
mine
for
surprises
i
was
putting
on
my
cloak
to
step
out
with
your
ladyship
letter
when
a
coach
with
a
footman
in
the
royal
undress
livery
sets
down
at
my
door
and
one
of
the
women
had
come
to
fetch
me
to
her
highness
and
there
i
was
kept
in
her
highness
chamber
half
the
morning
disputing
over
a
paduasoy
for
the
shrove
tuesday
masquerade
for
her
highness
gets
somewhat
bulky
and
is
not
easy
to
dress
to
her
advantage
or
to
my
credit
though
she
is
a
beauty
compared
with
the
queen
who
still
hankers
after
her
hideous
portuguese
fashions
and
employs
your
rival
madame
marifleur
marifleur
if
your
ladyship
knew
the
creature
as
well
as
i
do
you
call
her
sally
cramp
i
never
can
remember
a
low
english
name
marifleur
seems
to
promise
all
that
there
is
of
the
most
graceful
and
airy
in
a
ruffled
sleeve
and
a
ribbon
i
am
glad
to
see
your
ladyship
is
in
such
good
spirits
said
the
milliner
wondering
at
lady
fareham
flushed
cheeks
and
brilliant
eyes
they
were
brilliant
with
a
somewhat
glassy
brightness
and
there
was
a
touch
of
hysteria
in
her
manner
lewin
thought
she
had
been
drinking
many
of
her
customers
ended
that
way
took
to
cognac
and
ratafia
when
choicer
pleasures
were
exhausted
and
wrinkles
began
to
show
through
their
paint
hyacinth
was
reading
de
malfort
letter
as
she
talked
moving
about
the
room
a
little
and
then
stopping
in
front
of
the
fireplace
where
the
light
from
two
clusters
of
wax
candles
shone
down
upon
the
finely
written
page
lewin
watched
her
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
produced
some
pieces
of
silk
out
of
her
muff
i
made
so
bold
as
to
bring
your
ladyship
some
patterns
of
italian
silks
which
only
came
to
hand
this
morning
she
said
there
is
a
that
would
become
your
ladyship
to
the
make
me
a
gown
of
it
my
excellent
lewin
and
good
night
to
you
but
sure
your
ladyship
will
look
at
the
colour
there
is
a
pattern
of
amber
with
gold
thread
might
please
you
better
lady
castlemaine
has
ordered
a
court
mantua
lady
fareham
rang
her
with
a
vehemence
that
suggested
anger
show
lewin
to
her
coach
she
said
shortly
when
her
woman
appeared
when
you
have
done
that
you
may
go
to
bed
i
want
nothing
more
kirkland
has
been
asking
to
see
your
ladyship
i
will
see
no
one
tell
kirkland
so
with
my
love
she
ran
to
the
door
when
the
maid
and
milliner
were
gone
and
locked
it
and
then
ran
back
to
the
fireplace
and
flung
herself
down
upon
the
rug
to
read
her
letter
ch√©rie
when
this
is
handed
to
you
i
shall
be
sitting
in
my
coach
on
the
dull
dover
road
with
windows
and
a
heart
heavier
than
your
leaden
skies
loveliest
of
women
all
things
must
end
and
despite
your
childlike
trust
in
man
virtue
you
could
scarce
hope
for
eternity
to
a
bond
that
was
too
strong
for
friendship
and
too
weak
for
love
dearest
had
you
given
yourself
that
claim
upon
love
and
honour
which
we
have
talked
of
and
which
you
have
ever
refused
no
lesser
power
than
death
should
have
parted
us
i
would
have
dared
all
conquered
all
for
my
dear
mistress
but
you
would
not
it
was
not
for
lack
of
fervid
prayers
that
the
statue
remained
a
statue
but
a
man
can
not
go
on
worshipping
a
statue
for
ever
if
the
holy
mother
did
not
sometimes
vouchsafe
a
sign
of
human
feeling
even
good
catholics
would
have
left
off
kneeling
to
her
image
or
shall
i
say
rather
that
the
child
remains
a
child
fresh
and
pure
and
innocent
and
candid
as
in
the
days
when
we
played
our
de
in
your
grandmother
garden
fit
emblem
of
the
light
love
of
our
future
years
you
remained
a
child
hyacinth
and
asked
childish
from
a
man
dearest
accept
a
cruel
truth
from
a
man
of
the
world
it
is
only
the
love
you
call
guilty
that
lasts
there
is
a
stimulus
in
sin
and
mystery
that
will
fan
the
flame
of
passion
and
keep
love
alive
even
for
an
inferior
object
the
ugly
women
know
this
and
make
lax
morals
a
substitute
for
beauty
an
innocent
intrigue
a
butterfly
affection
like
ours
will
seldom
outlive
the
butterfly
brief
day
indeed
i
sometimes
admire
at
myself
as
a
marvel
of
constancy
for
having
kept
faith
so
long
with
a
mistress
who
has
rewarded
me
so
sparingly
so
my
angel
i
am
leaving
your
foggy
island
my
cramped
london
lodgings
and
extortionate
london
tradesmen
on
whom
i
have
squandered
so
much
of
my
fortune
that
they
ought
to
forgive
me
for
leaving
a
margin
of
debt
which
i
hope
to
pay
the
extortioners
hereafter
for
the
honour
of
my
name
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
revisit
england
i
have
tasted
all
london
pleasures
till
familiarity
has
taken
the
taste
out
of
them
and
though
paris
may
be
only
london
with
a
difference
that
difference
includes
bluer
skies
brighter
streets
and
gardens
and
all
the
originals
of
which
you
have
here
the
copies
there
at
least
i
shall
have
the
fashion
of
my
peruke
and
my
speech
at
first
hand
here
you
only
adopt
a
mode
when
paris
begins
to
tire
of
it
farewell
then
dearest
lady
but
let
it
be
no
tragical
or
eternal
parting
since
your
fine
house
in
the
rue
de
touraine
will
doubtless
be
honoured
with
your
presence
some
day
you
have
only
to
open
a
salon
there
in
order
to
be
the
top
of
the
mode
some
really
patrician
milieu
is
needed
to
replace
the
antique
court
of
the
dear
old
marquise
and
to
extinguish
the
scud√©ry
whose
saturdays
grow
more
vulgar
every
week
yes
you
will
come
to
paris
bringing
that
human
lily
angela
in
your
train
and
i
promise
to
make
you
the
fashion
before
your
house
has
been
open
a
month
the
wits
and
court
favourites
will
go
where
i
bid
them
and
though
your
dearest
friend
madame
de
longueville
has
retired
from
the
world
in
which
she
was
more
queenly
than
the
queen
you
will
find
mademoiselle
de
montpensier
as
faithful
as
ever
to
mundane
pleasures
and
after
having
refused
kings
and
princes
slavishly
devoted
to
a
colonel
of
dragoons
who
does
not
care
a
straw
for
her
louise
de
bourbon
a
woman
who
can
head
a
revolt
and
fire
a
cannon
would
think
no
sacrifice
too
great
for
a
schemer
like
lauzun
yet
you
who
swore
you
loved
me
when
the
coach
was
waiting
that
would
have
carried
me
to
paradise
and
made
us
one
for
all
this
life
could
suffer
a
foolish
girl
to
separate
us
in
the
very
moment
of
triumphant
union
you
were
mine
hyacinth
heart
and
mind
were
consenting
when
your
sister
surprised
us
and
all
my
hopes
of
bliss
expired
in
a
sermon
and
now
i
can
but
say
with
that
witty
rhymester
whom
everybody
in
london
quotes
in
your
heart
as
idly
burns
as
fire
in
antique
roman
urns
which
means
be
with
you
i
know
not
if
the
fear
of
him
was
in
your
mind
when
you
sacrificed
your
lover
to
that
icy
abstraction
women
call
virtue
the
romans
had
but
one
virtue
which
meant
the
courage
that
dares
and
to
me
the
highest
type
of
woman
would
be
one
whose
bold
spirit
dared
and
defied
the
world
for
love
sake
these
are
the
women
history
remembers
and
whom
the
men
who
live
after
them
worship
cleopatra
mary
stuart
diana
of
poictiers
marguerite
de
valois
la
chevreuse
la
montbazon
think
you
that
these
became
famous
by
keeping
their
lovers
at
a
distance
lovely
rose
how
often
i
have
sung
those
lines
and
you
have
listened
and
nothing
has
come
of
it
except
time
wasted
smiles
sighs
and
tears
that
ever
promised
and
ever
denied
beauty
too
choice
to
be
kind
adieu
de
malfort
when
she
had
read
these
last
words
she
crushed
the
letter
in
her
palm
clenching
her
fingers
over
it
till
the
nails
wounded
the
delicate
flesh
and
then
she
opened
her
hand
and
employed
herself
in
smoothing
out
the
crumpled
paper
as
if
her
life
depended
on
making
the
letter
readable
again
but
her
pains
could
not
undo
what
her
passion
had
done
and
finding
this
she
tossed
the
ragged
paper
into
the
flames
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
in
a
distracted
fashion
giving
a
little
hysterical
cry
every
now
and
then
and
clasping
her
hands
upon
her
forehead
anger
humiliation
wounded
love
wounded
vanity
disappointment
disillusion
were
all
in
that
cry
and
in
the
passionate
beating
of
her
heart
her
stifled
breath
her
clenched
hands
he
was
laughing
when
he
wrote
that
letter
i
am
sure
he
was
laughing
there
was
not
one
serious
moment
not
one
pang
at
leaving
me
he
has
been
laughing
at
me
ever
since
he
came
to
london
i
have
been
his
fool
his
amusement
other
women
have
had
his
love
the
guilty
love
that
he
praises
he
has
come
to
me
straight
from
their
wicked
houses
their
feasting
and
riot
and
drunkenness
has
come
and
pretended
to
love
poetry
and
romances
and
music
and
innocent
conversation
come
to
rest
himself
after
dissolute
pleasures
bringing
me
the
leavings
of
that
hellish
company
and
i
have
reviled
such
women
and
he
has
pretended
an
equal
horror
of
them
and
he
was
their
slave
all
the
time
and
went
from
me
to
them
and
made
a
jest
of
me
for
their
amusement
i
know
his
biting
raillery
and
he
was
at
the
day
after
day
where
i
could
not
go
sitting
side
by
side
with
his
jezebels
laughing
at
filthy
comedies
and
at
me
that
was
forbidden
to
appear
there
he
had
pleasures
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
when
i
fancied
our
inmost
souls
moved
in
harmony
his
thoughts
were
full
of
wanton
women
and
their
wanton
jests
and
he
smiled
at
my
childishness
and
fooled
me
as
children
are
fooled
the
thought
was
distraction
she
plucked
out
handfuls
of
her
pale
gold
hair
the
pretty
blonde
hair
which
had
been
almost
as
famous
in
paris
as
beaufort
or
madame
de
longueville
yellow
locks
the
thought
of
de
malfort
ridicule
cut
her
like
a
whalebone
whip
she
had
fancied
herself
his
beatrice
his
laura
his
stella
a
being
to
be
worshipped
as
reverently
as
the
stars
to
make
her
lover
happy
with
smiles
and
kindly
words
to
stand
for
ever
a
little
way
off
like
a
goddess
in
her
temple
yet
near
enough
to
be
adored
and
fondly
believing
this
to
be
her
mission
having
posed
for
the
character
and
filled
it
to
her
own
fancy
she
found
that
she
had
only
been
a
dissolute
man
dupe
all
the
time
and
no
doubt
had
been
the
of
her
acquaintance
who
looked
at
the
game
and
i
was
so
proud
of
his
devotion
i
carried
my
slave
everywhere
with
me
oh
fool
fool
fool
and
then
the
poor
little
brains
being
disordered
by
passionate
regrets
wickedest
ideas
ran
riot
in
the
confusion
of
a
mind
not
wide
enough
to
hold
life
large
passions
she
began
to
be
sorry
that
she
was
not
like
those
other
women
to
hate
the
modesty
that
had
lost
her
a
lover
to
be
like
barbara
castlemaine
that
was
woman
only
royalty
to
rule
with
sovereign
power
over
the
hearts
and
senses
of
men
a
king
for
her
lover
constant
in
inconstancy
always
going
back
to
her
from
every
transient
fancy
her
property
her
chattel
and
the
foremost
wits
and
dandies
of
the
age
for
her
servants
her
court
of
adorers
whom
she
ruled
with
frowns
or
smiles
as
her
humour
prompted
to
be
daring
profuse
reckless
tyrannical
to
suffer
no
control
of
heaven
or
men
yes
that
was
indeed
to
be
a
queen
and
compared
with
such
empire
the
poor
authority
of
the
pr√©cieuse
dictating
the
choice
of
adjectives
condemning
pronouns
theorising
upon
feelings
and
passions
of
which
in
practice
she
knows
nothing
was
a
thing
for
scornfullest
laughter
chapter
xx
philaster
january
was
nearly
over
the
memorial
service
for
the
martyred
king
was
drawing
near
and
royalty
and
fashion
had
deserted
whitehall
for
hampton
court
yet
the
farehams
lingered
at
their
riverside
mansion
his
lordship
had
business
in
london
while
sir
denzil
warner
who
came
to
fareham
house
daily
was
also
detained
in
the
city
by
some
special
attraction
which
made
hawk
and
hound
and
even
his
worthy
mother
company
indifferent
to
him
lady
fareham
had
an
air
of
caring
for
neither
town
nor
country
but
on
the
whole
preferred
town
london
has
become
a
positive
desert
and
the
smoke
from
the
smouldering
ruins
poisons
the
garden
and
terrace
whenever
there
is
an
east
wind
she
complained
but
oxfordshire
would
be
a
worse
desert
and
i
believe
i
should
die
of
the
spleen
in
a
week
if
i
trusted
myself
in
that
great
rambling
abbey
i
can
just
suffer
life
in
london
so
i
suppose
i
had
best
stay
till
his
lordship
has
finished
his
business
about
which
he
is
so
secret
and
mysterious
denzil
was
more
devoted
more
solicitous
to
please
than
ever
and
had
a
better
chance
of
pleasing
now
that
most
of
her
ladyship
fine
visitors
had
left
town
he
read
aloud
to
hyacinth
and
her
sister
as
they
worked
or
pretended
to
work
at
their
embroidery
frames
he
played
the
organ
and
sang
duets
with
angela
he
walked
with
her
on
the
terrace
in
the
cold
bleak
afternoon
and
told
her
the
news
of
the
town
not
the
scandals
and
trivialities
which
alone
interested
lady
fareham
but
the
graver
facts
connected
with
the
state
and
the
public
welfare
the
prospects
of
war
or
peace
the
outlook
towards
france
and
spain
holland
and
sweden
andrew
marvel
last
speech
or
the
last
grant
to
the
king
who
might
be
relied
on
to
oppose
no
popular
measure
when
his
lieges
were
about
to
provide
a
handsome
subsidy
or
an
increase
of
his
revenue
we
are
winning
our
liberties
from
him
denzil
said
for
the
mess
of
pottage
we
give
the
money
he
squanders
on
libertine
pleasures
england
is
buying
freedom
yet
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
maintain
this
phantom
king
this
court
which
shocks
and
outrages
every
decent
englishman
sense
of
right
and
maintains
an
hotbed
of
corruption
so
that
habits
and
extravagances
once
unknown
beyond
that
focus
of
all
vice
are
now
spreading
as
fast
as
london
and
wherever
there
are
bricks
and
mortar
there
are
profligacy
and
irreligion
can
you
wonder
that
all
the
best
and
wisest
in
this
city
regret
cromwell
iron
rule
the
rule
of
the
strongest
and
deplore
that
so
bold
a
stroke
for
liberty
should
have
ended
in
such
foolish
subservience
to
a
king
of
whom
we
knew
nothing
when
we
begged
him
to
come
and
reign
over
us
but
if
you
win
liberty
while
he
is
king
if
wise
laws
are
established
yes
but
we
might
have
been
noble
as
well
as
free
there
is
something
so
petty
in
our
resumed
bondage
figure
to
yourself
a
thoroughbred
horse
that
had
kicked
off
the
traces
and
stood
free
upon
the
open
plain
with
arched
neck
and
lifted
nostrils
sniffing
the
morning
air
and
behold
he
creeps
back
to
his
harness
and
makes
himself
again
a
slave
we
had
done
with
the
stuarts
at
the
cost
of
a
tragedy
and
in
ten
years
we
call
them
back
again
and
put
on
the
old
shackles
and
for
common
sense
religion
and
freedom
we
have
the
orgies
of
whitehall
and
the
extravagance
of
lady
castlemaine
it
will
not
last
angela
it
can
not
last
i
was
with
his
lordship
in
artillery
row
last
night
and
we
talked
with
the
blind
sage
who
would
sacrifice
the
remnant
of
his
darkened
days
in
the
cause
of
liberty
sir
denzil
i
hope
you
are
not
plotting
mischief
you
and
my
brother
angela
said
anxiously
you
are
so
often
together
and
his
lordship
has
such
a
preoccupied
air
no
no
there
is
no
conspiring
but
there
is
plenty
of
discontent
it
would
need
but
little
to
fire
the
train
can
any
man
in
his
senses
be
happy
when
he
sees
his
country
which
ten
years
ago
was
at
the
pinnacle
of
power
and
renown
sinking
to
the
appanage
of
a
foreign
sovereign
england
threatened
with
a
return
to
rome
honest
men
forbidden
to
preach
the
gospel
and
innocent
seekers
after
truth
hounded
off
to
gaol
to
rot
among
malefactors
because
they
have
dared
to
worship
god
after
their
own
fashion
where
was
your
liberty
of
conscience
under
the
protectorate
when
the
liturgy
was
forbidden
as
if
it
were
an
unholy
thing
when
the
anglican
priests
were
turned
out
of
their
pulpits
and
the
anglican
service
tolerated
in
only
one
church
in
all
this
vast
london
angela
asked
indignantly
that
was
a
revolt
of
deep
thinkers
against
a
service
which
has
all
the
mechanical
artifice
of
romanism
without
its
strong
appeal
to
the
heart
and
the
senses
dry
empty
rigid
a
repetition
of
vain
phrases
if
i
am
ever
to
bow
my
neck
beneath
the
church
yoke
let
me
swallow
the
errors
of
papacy
rather
than
the
heartless
formalism
of
english
episcopacy
but
what
can
you
or
fareham
or
a
few
good
men
like
you
do
to
change
established
things
remember
venner
plot
and
how
many
lives
were
wasted
on
that
foolish
futile
attempt
you
can
only
hazard
your
lives
die
on
the
scaffold
or
would
you
like
to
see
civil
war
again
the
nation
divided
into
opposite
camps
englishmen
fighting
with
englishmen
can
you
forget
that
dreadful
last
year
of
the
rebellion
i
was
only
a
little
child
but
it
is
branded
deep
on
my
memory
can
you
forget
the
murder
of
the
king
he
was
murdered
let
milton
defend
the
deed
as
he
can
with
his
riches
of
big
words
i
have
wept
over
the
royal
martyr
own
account
of
his
sufferings
over
gauden
account
that
is
to
say
basilike
was
no
more
written
by
charles
than
by
cromwell
it
was
a
doctored
composition
a
churchman
spurious
history
trumped
up
by
charles
friends
and
partisans
possibly
with
the
approval
of
the
king
himself
it
is
a
fine
piece
of
special
pleading
in
a
bad
cause
you
make
me
hate
you
when
you
talk
so
slightingly
of
that
so
king
you
will
make
me
hate
you
more
if
you
lead
fareham
into
danger
by
underhand
work
against
the
present
king
lies
fareham
safety
so
very
near
your
heart
it
lies
in
my
heart
she
answered
looking
at
him
and
defying
him
with
straight
clear
gaze
is
he
not
my
sister
husband
and
to
me
as
a
brother
do
you
expect
me
to
be
careless
about
his
fate
i
know
you
are
leading
him
into
danger
some
mischief
must
come
of
these
visits
to
milton
a
republican
outlaw
who
has
escaped
the
penalty
of
his
treasonous
pamphlets
only
because
he
is
blind
and
old
and
poor
i
doubt
there
is
danger
in
all
such
conferences
fareham
is
at
heart
a
republican
it
would
need
little
persuasion
to
make
him
a
traitor
to
the
king
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
make
me
so
much
your
slave
that
i
would
sacrifice
every
patriotic
aspiration
at
your
bidding
angela
denzil
answered
gravely
i
know
not
if
this
be
the
time
to
speak
or
if
after
waiting
more
than
a
year
i
may
not
even
now
be
premature
dearest
girl
you
know
that
i
love
you
that
i
haunt
this
house
only
because
you
live
here
that
i
am
in
london
only
because
my
star
shines
there
that
above
all
public
interests
you
rule
my
life
i
have
exercised
a
prodigious
patience
only
because
i
have
a
prodigious
resolution
is
it
not
time
for
me
to
reap
my
reward
oh
denzil
you
fill
me
with
sorrow
have
i
not
said
everything
to
discourage
you
and
have
i
not
refused
to
be
discouraged
angela
i
am
resolved
to
discover
the
reason
of
your
coldness
was
there
ever
a
young
and
lovely
woman
who
shut
love
out
of
her
heart
history
has
no
record
of
such
an
one
i
am
of
an
appropriate
age
of
good
birth
and
good
means
not
not
brutish
or
of
repulsive
face
and
figure
if
your
heart
is
free
i
ought
to
be
able
to
win
it
if
you
will
not
favour
my
suit
it
must
be
because
there
is
some
one
else
some
one
who
came
before
me
or
who
has
crossed
my
path
and
to
whom
your
heart
has
been
secretly
given
she
had
turned
from
red
to
pale
as
he
spoke
she
stood
before
him
in
the
winter
light
with
her
colour
changing
her
hands
tightly
clasped
her
eyes
cast
down
and
tears
trembling
on
the
long
dark
lashes
you
have
no
right
to
question
me
it
is
enough
for
you
to
have
my
honest
answer
i
esteem
you
but
i
do
not
love
you
and
it
distresses
me
when
you
talk
of
love
there
is
some
one
else
then
i
knew
it
there
is
some
one
else
for
me
you
are
marble
you
are
fire
for
him
he
is
in
your
heart
you
have
said
it
how
dare
you
she
began
why
should
i
shrink
from
warning
you
of
your
danger
it
is
fareham
you
love
i
have
seen
you
tremble
at
his
touch
start
at
the
sound
of
his
footstep
that
step
you
know
so
well
his
footstep
why
the
very
air
he
breathes
carries
to
you
the
consciousness
of
his
approach
oh
i
have
watched
you
both
angela
and
i
know
i
know
jealous
pangs
have
racked
me
day
after
day
yet
i
have
hung
on
i
have
been
very
patient
knows
not
the
sinful
impulses
of
her
own
heart
i
said
not
in
her
purity
how
near
she
goes
to
a
fall
here
in
her
sister
house
passionately
loved
by
her
sister
husband
she
calls
him
whose
eyes
can
not
look
at
her
without
telling
their
story
of
wicked
love
she
walks
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
were
i
to
abandon
her
she
might
fall
my
affection
is
her
only
safeguard
and
by
winning
her
to
myself
i
shall
snatch
her
from
the
pit
of
hell
it
was
the
truth
he
was
telling
her
yes
even
when
fareham
was
harshest
she
had
been
dimly
conscious
that
love
was
at
the
root
of
his
unkindness
the
coldness
that
had
held
them
apart
since
that
midnight
meeting
had
been
ice
over
fire
it
was
jealousy
that
had
made
him
so
angry
no
word
of
love
directly
spoken
had
ever
offended
her
ear
but
there
had
been
many
a
speech
of
double
meaning
that
had
set
her
wondering
and
thinking
and
oh
the
guilt
of
it
when
an
honourable
man
like
denzil
set
her
sin
before
her
in
plain
language
she
stood
aghast
at
her
own
wickedness
that
which
had
been
a
sin
of
thought
only
a
secret
sorrow
wrestled
with
in
many
an
hour
of
heartfelt
prayer
with
all
the
labour
of
a
soul
that
sought
heavenly
aid
against
earthly
temptation
was
conjured
into
hideous
reality
by
denzil
plain
speech
to
love
her
sister
husband
to
suffer
his
guilty
love
to
know
gladness
only
in
his
company
to
be
exquisitely
happy
were
he
but
in
the
same
room
with
her
to
sink
to
profoundest
melancholy
when
he
was
absent
oh
the
sin
of
it
in
what
degree
did
her
guilt
differ
from
that
of
the
women
of
the
court
who
had
each
her
open
secret
in
some
base
intrigue
that
all
the
world
knew
and
laughed
at
she
had
been
kept
aloof
from
that
libertine
crew
but
was
she
any
better
than
they
was
fareham
who
openly
scorned
the
royal
debauchee
was
he
any
better
than
the
king
she
remembered
how
he
had
talked
of
lord
sandwich
making
excuses
for
a
perverted
love
she
had
heard
him
speak
of
other
offenders
in
the
same
strain
he
had
been
ever
ready
to
recognise
fatality
where
a
good
catholic
would
have
perceived
only
sin
angela
believe
me
you
are
drifting
helmless
in
perilous
waters
denzil
urged
while
she
stood
beside
him
in
mute
distress
let
me
be
your
strong
rock
only
give
me
the
promise
of
your
hand
i
can
be
patient
still
i
will
give
time
for
love
to
grow
grant
me
but
the
right
to
guard
you
from
the
danger
of
an
unholy
passion
that
is
always
near
you
in
this
house
you
pretend
to
be
his
lordship
friend
and
you
speak
slander
of
him
i
am
his
friend
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
him
for
loving
you
indeed
it
has
been
in
friendship
that
i
have
tried
to
interest
him
in
a
great
national
question
to
wean
him
from
his
darling
sin
but
were
you
my
wife
he
should
never
cross
our
threshold
the
day
that
made
us
one
should
make
you
and
fareham
strangers
it
is
for
you
to
choose
angela
between
two
men
who
love
you
one
near
your
own
age
free
the
other
nearly
old
enough
to
be
your
father
bound
by
the
tie
which
your
church
deems
indissoluble
whose
love
is
insult
and
pollution
and
can
but
end
in
shame
and
despair
it
is
for
you
to
choose
between
honest
and
dishonest
love
there
is
a
nobler
choice
open
to
me
she
said
more
calmly
than
she
had
yet
spoken
and
with
a
pale
dignity
in
her
countenance
that
awed
him
a
thrill
of
admiration
and
fear
ran
along
his
nerves
as
he
looked
at
her
she
seemed
transfigured
there
is
a
higher
and
better
love
she
said
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
considered
a
sure
way
out
of
all
my
difficulties
i
can
go
back
to
the
convent
where
in
my
dear
aunt
anastasia
i
saw
so
splendid
an
example
of
a
holy
life
hidden
from
the
world
life
buried
in
a
living
grave
cried
denzil
at
the
idea
of
such
a
sacrifice
and
reason
obscured
in
a
cloud
of
incense
all
the
great
uses
of
a
noble
life
brought
down
to
petty
observances
and
childish
mummeries
prayers
and
genuflections
before
waxen
relics
and
madonnas
oh
my
dearest
girl
next
worst
only
to
the
dominion
of
sin
is
the
slavery
of
a
false
religion
i
would
have
thee
free
as
air
free
and
enlightened
released
from
the
trammels
of
rome
happy
in
thyself
and
useful
to
thy
you
see
sir
denzil
even
if
we
loved
each
other
we
could
never
think
alike
angela
said
with
a
gentle
sadness
our
minds
would
always
dwell
far
apart
things
that
are
dear
and
sacred
to
me
are
hateful
to
you
if
you
love
me
i
could
win
you
to
my
way
of
thinking
he
said
you
mean
that
if
i
loved
you
i
should
love
you
better
than
i
love
god
not
so
dear
but
you
would
open
your
mind
to
the
truth
paul
sanctified
union
between
christian
and
pagan
and
deemed
the
unbelieving
wife
sanctified
by
the
believing
husband
there
can
be
no
sin
therefore
despite
my
poor
mother
violent
opinions
in
the
union
of
those
who
worship
the
same
god
and
whose
creed
differs
only
in
particulars
knowest
thou
o
man
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
wife
indeed
love
i
doubt
not
my
power
to
wean
you
from
the
errors
of
your
early
education
can
not
you
see
how
wide
apart
we
are
every
word
you
say
widens
the
gulf
betwixt
us
indeed
sir
denzil
you
had
best
remain
my
friend
you
can
be
nothing
else
she
turned
from
him
almost
impatiently
young
handsome
of
a
frank
and
generous
nature
he
yet
lacked
the
gifts
that
charm
women
or
at
least
this
one
woman
was
cold
to
him
it
might
be
that
in
his
own
nature
there
was
a
coldness
a
something
wanting
the
fire
we
miss
in
that
great
poet
of
the
age
whose
verse
could
rise
to
themes
transcendent
but
never
burnt
with
the
white
heat
of
human
passion
papillon
came
flying
along
the
terrace
her
skirts
and
waving
tresses
spread
wide
in
the
wind
a
welcome
intruder
what
are
you
and
sir
denzil
doing
in
the
cold
i
have
news
for
my
dear
dearest
auntie
my
lord
is
in
a
good
humour
and
is
to
be
acted
by
the
duke
servants
and
her
ladyship
footmen
are
keeping
places
for
us
in
the
boxes
i
have
only
seen
three
plays
in
my
life
and
they
were
all
sad
ones
i
wish
was
a
comedy
i
should
like
to
see
in
a
that
must
be
full
of
drollery
but
his
honour
likes
only
grave
plays
be
brisk
auntie
the
coach
will
be
at
the
door
directly
come
and
put
on
your
hood
his
lordship
says
we
need
no
masks
i
should
have
loved
to
wear
a
mask
are
you
coming
to
the
play
sir
denzil
i
know
not
if
i
am
bidden
or
if
there
be
a
place
for
me
why
you
can
stand
with
the
fops
in
the
pit
and
you
can
buy
us
some
china
oranges
i
heard
lady
sarah
tell
my
mother
that
the
new
little
actress
with
the
pretty
feet
was
once
an
who
lived
with
lord
buckhurst
why
did
he
have
an
to
live
with
him
he
must
be
vastly
fond
of
oranges
i
should
love
to
sell
oranges
in
the
pit
if
i
could
be
an
actress
afterwards
i
would
rather
be
an
actress
than
a
duchess
mademoiselle
taught
me
chim√©ne
tirades
in
corneille
i
learn
quicker
than
any
pupil
she
ever
had
monsieur
de
malfort
once
said
i
was
a
born
actress
pursued
papillon
as
they
walked
to
the
house
that
story
of
unhappy
love
so
pure
patient
melancholy
disinterested
how
often
angela
had
hung
over
the
page
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
chamber
and
to
hear
the
lines
spoken
when
a
tempest
of
emotion
had
been
raised
in
her
breast
with
fareham
by
her
side
to
meet
his
glances
at
this
or
that
moment
of
the
play
when
the
devoted
girl
was
revealing
the
secret
of
her
passionate
heart
yet
never
was
love
freer
from
taint
of
sin
and
the
end
of
the
play
was
in
no
wise
tragic
that
pure
affection
was
encouraged
and
sanctified
by
the
happy
bride
bellario
was
not
to
be
banished
but
sheltered
alas
yes
but
this
was
love
unreturned
there
was
no
answering
warmth
on
philaster
part
no
fire
of
passion
to
scathe
and
destroy
only
a
gentle
gratitude
for
the
girl
devotion
a
brother
not
a
lover
regard
she
found
fareham
and
her
sister
in
the
hall
ready
to
step
into
the
coach
i
saw
the
name
of
your
favourite
play
on
the
posts
as
i
walked
home
he
said
and
as
hyacinth
is
always
teasing
me
for
denying
her
the
i
thought
this
was
a
good
opportunity
for
pleasing
you
both
you
would
have
pleased
me
more
if
you
had
offered
me
the
chance
of
seeing
a
new
comedy
his
wife
retorted
pettishly
ah
dearest
let
us
not
resume
an
old
quarrel
the
of
elizabeth
age
were
poets
and
gentlemen
the
men
who
write
for
us
are
blackguards
and
fops
we
have
novelty
which
is
all
most
of
us
want
a
hundred
new
plays
in
a
year
of
which
scarce
one
will
be
remembered
after
the
year
is
out
who
wants
to
remember
the
highest
merit
in
a
play
is
that
it
should
be
a
reflection
of
and
who
minds
if
it
be
stale
to
hold
the
mirror
up
to
nature
does
your
shakespeare
say
and
what
more
transient
than
the
image
in
a
glass
a
comedy
should
be
like
one
hat
or
one
gown
the
top
of
the
mode
and
cast
off
and
forgotten
in
a
week
that
is
what
our
fine
gentlemen
think
who
are
satisfied
if
their
wit
gets
three
days
acceptance
and
some
substantial
compliment
from
the
patron
to
whom
they
dedicate
their
trash
his
lordship
liveries
and
four
grey
horses
made
a
stir
in
lincoln
inn
fields
and
startled
the
crowd
at
the
doors
of
the
new
theatre
and
within
the
house
lady
fareham
and
her
sister
divided
the
attention
of
the
pit
with
their
royal
highnesses
the
duke
and
duchess
who
no
longer
amused
or
scandalised
the
audience
by
those
honeymoon
coquetries
which
had
distinguished
their
earlier
appearances
in
public
duchess
anne
was
growing
stout
and
fast
losing
her
beauty
and
duke
james
was
imitating
his
brother
infidelities
after
his
own
stealthy
fashion
so
it
may
be
that
clarendon
daughter
was
no
more
happy
than
her
the
queen
nor
than
her
father
the
chancellor
over
whom
the
shadows
of
royal
disfavour
were
darkening
lady
fareham
lolled
languidly
back
in
her
box
and
let
all
the
audience
see
her
indifference
to
fletcher
poetic
dialogue
angela
sat
motionless
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
entranced
by
that
romantic
story
and
the
acting
which
gave
life
and
reality
to
that
poetic
fable
as
well
it
might
when
the
incomparable
betterton
played
philaster
fareham
stood
beside
his
wife
looking
down
at
the
stage
and
sometimes
as
angela
looked
up
their
eyes
met
in
one
swift
flash
of
responsive
thought
met
and
glanced
away
as
if
each
knew
the
peril
of
such
meetings
if
it
be
love
to
forget
all
respect
of
his
own
friends
in
thinking
on
your
face
was
it
by
chance
that
fareham
sighed
as
those
lines
were
spoken
and
again
if
when
he
goes
to
rest
which
will
not
be
every
prayer
he
says
he
names
you
once
and
again
was
it
chance
that
brought
that
swift
questioning
look
upon
her
from
those
severe
eyes
in
the
midst
of
philaster
tirade
how
heaven
is
in
your
eyes
but
in
your
hearts
more
hell
than
hell
has
how
your
tongues
like
scorpions
both
heal
and
poison
how
your
thoughts
are
woven
with
thousand
changes
in
one
subtle
web
and
worn
so
by
you
how
that
foolish
man
that
reads
the
story
of
a
woman
face
and
dies
believing
it
is
lost
for
ever
it
was
angela
whose
eyes
unconsciously
sought
his
when
that
passage
occurred
which
had
written
itself
upon
her
heart
long
ago
at
chilton
when
she
first
read
the
play
alas
my
lord
my
life
is
not
a
thing
worthy
your
noble
thoughts
is
not
a
life
is
but
a
piece
of
childhood
thrown
away
what
was
her
poor
life
worth
so
lonely
even
in
her
sister
house
so
desolate
when
his
eyes
looked
not
upon
her
in
kindness
after
having
lived
for
two
brief
summers
and
winters
in
his
cherished
company
having
learnt
to
know
what
a
proud
honourable
man
was
like
his
disdain
of
vice
his
indifference
to
court
favour
his
aspirations
for
liberty
after
having
known
him
and
loved
him
with
silent
and
secret
love
what
better
could
she
do
than
bury
herself
within
convent
walls
and
spend
the
rest
of
her
days
in
praying
for
those
she
loved
alas
he
had
such
need
that
some
faithful
soul
should
soar
heavenward
in
supplication
for
him
who
had
himself
so
weak
a
hold
upon
the
skies
alas
to
think
of
him
as
unbelieving
putting
his
trust
in
the
opinions
of
infidels
like
hobbes
and
spinoza
rather
than
leaning
on
that
rock
of
ages
the
church
of
peter
if
she
could
not
live
for
him
if
it
were
a
sin
even
to
dwell
under
the
same
roof
with
him
she
could
at
least
die
for
him
die
to
the
world
of
pleasure
and
folly
of
beauty
and
splendour
die
to
friendship
and
love
sink
all
individuality
under
the
monastic
rule
cease
to
be
except
as
a
part
in
a
great
organisation
an
atom
acting
and
acted
upon
by
higher
powers
surrendering
every
desire
and
every
hope
that
distinguished
her
from
the
multitude
of
women
vowed
to
a
holy
life
never
sir
will
i
marry
it
is
a
thing
within
my
vow
the
voice
of
the
actress
sounded
as
bellario
spoke
her
last
speech
finishing
her
story
of
a
love
which
can
submit
to
take
the
lower
place
and
asks
but
little
of
fate
it
is
a
thing
within
my
vow
the
line
repeated
itself
in
angela
mind
as
denzil
met
them
at
the
door
and
handed
her
into
the
coach
should
she
prove
of
weaker
stuff
than
the
sad
eufrasia
and
accept
a
husband
she
did
not
love
this
humdrum
modern
age
allowed
of
no
romance
she
could
not
stain
her
face
with
walnut
juice
and
disguise
herself
as
a
footboy
and
live
unknown
in
his
service
to
wait
upon
him
when
he
was
weary
to
nurse
him
when
he
was
sick
such
a
life
she
would
have
deemed
exquisitely
happy
but
the
hard
everyday
world
had
no
room
for
such
dreams
in
this
unromantic
age
dion
daughter
would
be
recognised
within
hours
of
her
putting
on
male
attire
the
golden
days
of
poetry
were
dead
una
would
find
no
lion
to
fawn
at
her
feet
she
would
be
mobbed
in
the
strand
oh
that
it
could
have
been
thought
angela
as
the
coach
jolted
and
rumbled
through
the
narrow
ways
and
shaved
awkward
corners
with
its
ponderous
wheels
and
got
its
horses
entangled
with
other
noble
teams
to
the
provocation
of
much
from
postillions
and
flunkeys
and
linkmen
for
it
was
dark
when
they
came
out
of
the
theatre
and
a
thick
mist
was
rising
from
the
river
and
flambeaux
were
flaring
up
and
down
the
dim
narrow
thoroughfares
they
light
the
streets
better
in
paris
complained
hyacinth
in
the
rue
de
touraine
we
had
a
lamp
to
every
house
i
like
to
see
the
links
moving
up
and
down
said
papillon
is
ever
so
much
prettier
than
lanterns
that
stand
still
like
that
one
at
the
corner
she
pointed
to
a
small
round
lamp
that
made
a
bubble
of
light
in
an
abyss
of
gloom
here
the
lamps
stink
more
than
they
light
said
hyacinth
how
the
coach
rocks
those
blockheads
will
end
by
upsetting
it
i
should
have
been
twice
as
well
in
my
chair
angela
sat
in
her
place
lost
in
thought
and
hardly
conscious
of
the
jolting
coach
or
of
papillon
prattle
who
would
not
be
satisfied
till
she
had
dragged
her
aunt
into
the
conversation
did
you
not
love
the
play
and
would
you
not
love
to
be
a
princess
like
arethusa
and
to
wear
such
a
necklace
mother
diamonds
are
not
half
as
big
pshaw
child
was
absolute
glass
arrant
trumpery
but
her
gown
was
not
trumpery
it
was
lady
castlemaine
last
birthday
gown
i
heard
a
lady
telling
her
friend
about
it
in
the
seat
next
mine
lady
castlemaine
gave
it
to
the
actress
and
it
cost
three
hundred
pounds
and
lady
castlemaine
is
all
that
there
is
of
the
most
extravagant
the
lady
said
and
old
rowley
has
to
pay
her
debts
who
is
old
rowley
and
why
does
he
pay
people
debts
though
she
is
the
most
unscrupulous
i
forget
the
word
in
london
you
see
madam
what
a
good
school
the
is
for
your
child
said
fareham
grimly
i
never
asked
you
to
take
our
child
there
nay
hyacinth
but
a
mother
should
enter
no
scene
unfit
for
her
innocence
oh
my
lord
your
opinions
are
of
the
protectorate
you
would
be
better
in
new
england
tilling
your
fields
reclaimed
from
the
waste
yes
i
might
be
better
there
reclaimed
from
the
waste
of
london
life
strange
that
your
talk
should
hit
upon
new
england
i
was
thinking
of
that
new
world
not
an
hour
ago
at
the
play
thinking
what
a
happy
innocent
life
a
man
might
lead
there
were
he
but
young
and
free
with
one
he
loved
innocent
yes
happy
no
unless
he
were
a
savage
or
a
peasant
hyacinth
exclaimed
disdainfully
we
that
have
known
the
grace
and
beauty
of
life
can
not
go
back
to
the
habits
of
our
ancestors
to
eat
without
forks
and
cover
our
floors
with
rushes
instead
of
persian
carpets
the
beauty
and
grace
of
life
houses
that
are
whited
sepulchres
banquets
where
there
is
no
love
the
coach
stopped
before
the
tall
italian
doorway
and
fareham
handed
out
his
wife
and
sister
in
silence
but
there
was
one
of
the
party
to
whom
it
was
unnatural
to
be
mute
papillon
sprang
off
the
coach
step
into
her
father
arms
sweetheart
why
are
you
so
sad
she
asked
you
look
more
unhappy
than
philaster
when
he
thought
his
lady
loved
him
not
she
would
not
be
put
off
but
hung
about
him
all
the
length
of
the
corridor
to
the
door
of
his
room
where
he
parted
from
her
with
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
how
your
lips
burn
she
cried
i
hope
you
are
not
sickening
for
the
plague
i
dreamt
last
night
that
the
contagion
had
come
back
and
that
our
new
glass
coach
was
going
about
with
a
bell
collecting
the
dead

hadst
eaten

much

business
you
have
always
business
now
you
used
to
let
me
stay
with
you
even
when
you
was
busy
henriette
remonstrated
dejectedly
as
the
sonorous
oak
door
closed
against
her
fareham
flung
himself
into
his
chair
in
front
of
the
large
table
with
its
books
and
litter
of
papers
straight
before
him
there
lay
milton
pamphlet
a
publication
of
ten
years
ago
but
he
had
been
reading
it
only
that
morning
the
doctrine
and
discipline
of
divorce
there
were
sentences
which
seemed
to
him
to
stand
out
upon
the
page
almost
as
if
written
in
fire
and
to
these
he
recurred
again
and
again
brooding
over
and
weighing
every
word
can
this
law
be
of
force
to
engage
a
blameless
creature
to
his
own
perpetual
sorrow
mistaken
for
his
expected
solace
without
suffering
charity
to
step
in
and
do
a
confessed
good
work
of
parting
those
whom
nothing
holds
together
but
this
of
joining
falsely
supposed
against
the
express
end
of
his
own
ordinance
is
not
good
said
he
man
should
be
alone
i
will
make
him
a
helpmeet
for
him
from
which
words
so
plain
less
can
not
be
concluded
nor
is
by
any
learned
interpreter
than
that
in
god
intention
a
meet
and
happy
conversation
is
the
chiefest
and
noblest
end
of

where
the
mind
is
unsatisfied
the
solitariness
of
man
which
god
had
namely
and
principally
ordered
to
prevent
by
marriage
hath
no
remedy
but
lies
in
a
worse
condition
than
the
loneliest
single
life
for
in
single
life
the
absence
and
remoteness
of
a
helper
might
inure
him
to
expect
his
own
comforts
out
of
himself
or
to
seek
with
hope
but
here
the
continual
sight
of
his
deluded
thoughts
without
cure
must
needs
be
to
him
if
especially
his
complexion
incline
him
to
melancholy
a
daily
trouble
and
pain
of
loss
in
some
degree
like
that
which
reprobates
feel

closed
the
book
and
started
up
to
pace
the
long
lofty

full
of
shadow

chapter
xxi
london
sitting
in
her
own
room
before
supper
a
letter
was
brought
to
angela
a
long
letter
closely
written
in
a
neat
firm
hand
she
knew
very
well
it
was
from
denzil
warner
a
letter
full
of
earnest
thought
and
warm
feeling
in
which
he
pursued
the
subject
of
their
morning
discourse
we
were
interrupted
before
i
had
time
to
open
my
heart
to
you
dearest
he
wrote
and
at
a
moment
when
we
had
touched
on
the
most
delicate
point
in
our
friendship
the
difference
in
our
religious
education
and
observance
oh
my
beloved
let
not
difference
in
particulars
divide
two
hearts
that
worship
the
same
god
or
make
a
barrier
between
two
minds
that
think
alike
upon
essentials
the
christ
who
died
for
you
is
not
less
my
saviour
because
i
love
not
to
obtrude
the
image
of
his
earthly
mother
between
his
godhead
and
my
prayers
in
the
regeneration
of
baptism
in
the
sanctity
of
marriage
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
in
the
reality
of
sin
and
the
necessity
for
repentance
i
believe
as
truly
as
any
papist
living
let
our
lives
be
but
once
united
who
knows
how
the
future
may
shape
and
modify
our
minds
and
our
faith
i
may
be
brought
to
your
way
of
thinking
or
you
to
mine
i
will
pledge
myself
never
to
be
guilty
of
disrespect
to
your
religion
or
to
unkindly
urge
you
to
any
change
in
your
observances
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
have
exchanged
one
tyranny
for
another
and
who
released
from
the
dominion
of
rome
have
become
the
slave
of
the
covenant
i
have
been
taught
by
one
who
himself
deeply
religious
would
have
all
men
free
to
worship
god
by
the
light
of
their
own
conscience
and
to
my
wife
that
dearer
half
of
my
soul
i
would
allow
perfect
freedom
i
suffer
from
the
lack
of
poetic
phrases
with
which
to
embellish
the
plain
reality
of
my
love
but
be
sure
angela
that
you
may
travel
far
through
the
world
and
receive
many
a
flowery
compliment
to
your
beauty
yet
meet
none
who
will
love
you
as
faithfully
as
i
have
loved
you
for
this
year
last
past
and
as
i
doubt
i
shall
love
you
happy
or
unfortunate
in
my
wooing
for
all
the
rest
of
my
life
think
dearest
whether
it
were
not
wise
on
your
part
to
accept
the
chaste
and
respectful
homage
of
a
suitor
who
is
free
to
love
and
cherish
you
and
thus
to
shield
yourself
from
the
sinful
pursuit
of
one
who
offends
heaven
and
dishonours
you
whenever
he
looks
at
you
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
i
would
not
write
harshly
of
a
man
whose
very
sin
i
pity
and
whom
i
believe
not
wholly
vile
but
for
him
as
for
me
that
were
a
happy
day
which
should
make
you
my
wife
and
thus
end
the
madness
of
unholy
hopes
i
would
again
urge
that
lady
fareham
desires
our
union
with
all
a
concern
for
you
and
more
than
a
friend
tenderness
to
me
i
beseech
your
pardon
and
indulgence
for
my
rough
words
of
this
morning
god
forbid
that
i
should
impute
one
unworthy
thought
to
her
whose
virtues
i
honour
above
all
earthly
merit
if
your
heart
inclines
towards
one
whom
it
were
misery
for
you
to
love
i
know
that
it
must
be
with
an
affection
pure
and
ethereal
as
the
love
of
the
disguised
girl
in
fletcher
play
but
ah
dearest
angel
you
know
not
the
peril
in
which
you
walk
your
innocent
mind
can
not
conceive
the
audacious
height
to
which
unholy
love
may
climb
in
a
man
fiery
nature
you
can
not
fathom
the
black
depths
of
such
a
character
as
fareham
a
man
as
capable
of
greatness
in
evil
as
of
distinction
in
good
forget
not
whose
fierce
blood
runs
in
those
veins
can
you
doubt
his
audacity
in
when
you
remember
that
he
comes
of
the
same
stock
which
produced
that
renegade
and
tyrant
thomas
wentworth
a
man
who
would
have
waded
deep
in
the
blood
of
a
nation
to
reach
his
desired
goal
all
the
history
of
whose
life
was
expressed
by
him
in
one
word
do
you
consider
what
that
word
means
to
a
man
over
whose
heart
sin
has
taken
the
upper
hand
thorough
how
resolute
in
evil
how
undaunted
and
without
limit
in
baseness
is
he
who
takes
that
word
for
his
motto
oh
my
love
there
are
dragons
and
lions
about
thy
innocent
footsteps
the
dragons
of
lust
the
lions
of
presumptuous
love
flee
from
thy
worst
enemy
dearest
to
the
shelter
of
a

warner
angela
tore
up
the
letter
in
anger
how
dared
he
write
thus
of
lord
fareham
to
impute
sinful
passions
guilty
desires
to
enter
into
another
man
mind
and
read
the
secret
cipher
of
his
thoughts
and
wishes
with
an
assumed
key
which
might
be
false
his
letter
was
a
bundle
of
false
assumptions
what
right
had
he
to
insist
that
her
cared
for
her
with
more
than
the
affection
authorised
by
affinity
he
had
no
right
she
hated
him
for
his
insolent
letter
she
scorned
the
protection
of
his
love
she
had
her
refuge
and
her
shelter
in
a
holier
love
than
his
the
doors
of
the
old
home
would
open
to
her
at
a
word
she
sat
on
a
low
stool
in
front
of
the
hearth
while
the
pile
of
ship
timber
on
the
andirons
burnt
itself
out
and
turned
from
red
to
grey
she
sat
looking
into
the
dying
fire
and
recalling
the
pictures
of
the
past
the
dull
grey
convent
rooms
and
formal
convent
garden
the
petty
rules
and
restrictions
the
functions
low
mass
and
high
benedictions
vespers
the
recurrent
sound
of
the
chapel
bell
the
few
dull
books
permitted
in
the
hour
of
recreation
the
sombre
grey
gown
which
was
the
only
relief
from
perpetual
black
the
limitations
of
that
colourless
life
she
had
been
happy
with
the
ursulines
under
her
kinswoman
gentle
sway
but
could
she
be
happy
with
the
present
superior
whose
domineering
temper
she
knew
she
had
been
happy
in
her
ignorance
of
the
outer
world
but
could
she
be
happy
again
in
that
grey
seclusion
she
who
had
sat
at
the
banquet
of
life
who
had
seen
the
beauty
and
the
variety
of
her
native
land
to
be
an
exile
for
the
rest
of
her
days
in
the
hopeless
gloom
of
a
flemish
convent
among
the
heavy
faces
of
flemish
nuns
in
the
intensity
of
introspective
thought
she
had
forgotten
one
who
had
forbidden
that
gloomy
seclusion
and
to
whom
it
would
be
as
natural
for
her
to
look
for
protection
and
refuge
as
to
convent
or
husband
from
her
thoughts
the
image
of
her
wandering
father
had
been
absent
his
appearances
in
her
life
had
been
so
rare
and
so
brief
his
influence
on
her
destiny
so
slight
that
she
was
forgetful
of
him
now
in
this
crisis
of
her
fate
it
was
within
a
week
of
that
evening
that
the
sisters
were
startled
by
the
arrival
of
their
father
unannounced
in
the
dusk
of
the
winter
afternoon
he
had
come
by
slow
stages
from
spain
riding
the
greater
part
of
the
journey
like
howell
fifty
years
earlier
attended
only
by
one
faithful
and
enduring
no
small
suffering
and
running
no
slight
risk
upon
the
road
the
wolves
had
our
provender
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
told
them
the
wonder
is
they
never
had
us
or
our
hackneys
i
left
madrid
in
july
not
long
after
the
death
of
my
poor
friend
fanshawe
indeed
it
was
his
friendship
and
his
good
lady
unvarying
courtesy
that
took
me
to
the
capital
we
had
last
met
at
hampton
court
with
the
king
shortly
before
his
majesty
so
flight
and
we
were
then
and
so
he
being
dead
of
a
fever
early
in
the
summer
i
had
no
more
to
do
but
to
travel
slowly
homeward
to
end
my
days
in
my
own
and
to
claim
thy
promise
angela
that
thou
wouldst
keep
my
house
and
comfort
my
declining
years
dear
father
angela
murmured
hanging
over
him
as
he
sat
in
the
velvet
chair
by
the
fire
while
her
ladyship
footmen
set
a
table
near
him
with
wine
and
provisions
for
an
impromptu
meal
lady
fareham
directing
them
and
coming
to
embrace
her
father
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
the
firelight
shining
on
her
velvet
gown
and
primrose
taffety
petticoat
her
pretty
golden
curls
and
sparkling
s√©vign√©
her
ruby
necklace
and
earrings
and
her
bright
restless
eyes
while
the
elder
sister
was
all
movement
and
agitation
the
younger
stood
calm
and
still
beside
her
father
chair
her
hands
clasped
in
his
her
thoughtful
eyes
looking
down
at
him
as
he
talked
stopping
now
and
then
in
his
story
of
adventures
to
eat
and
drink
he
looked
much
older
than
when
he
surprised
her
in
the
convent
garden
his
hair
and
beard
then
iron
grey
were
now
silver
white
he
wore
his
own
hair
which
was
abundant
and
a
beard
cut
after
the
fashion
she
knew
in
the
portraits
of
henri
quatre
his
clothes
also
were
of
that
style
which
lived
now
only
in
the
paintings
of
vandyke
and
his
school
how
the
girl
looks
at
me
sir
john
said
surprising
his
earnest
gaze
does
she
take
me
for
a
ghost
indeed
sir
she
may
well
fancy
you
have
come
back
from
the
other
world
while
you
wear
that
antique
suit
said
hyacinth
i
hope
your
first
business
will
be
to
replenish
your
wardrobe
by
the
assistance
of
lord
rochester
tailor
he
is
a
german
and
has
the
best
cut
for
a
in
all
the
west
end
fareham
is
shabby
enough
to
make
a
wife
ashamed
of
him
but
his
clothes
are
only
too
plain
for
his
condition
your
spanish
cloak
and
steeple
hat
are
fitter
for
a
travelling
quack
doctor
than
for
a
gentleman
of
quality
and
your
doublet
and
vest
might
have
come
out
of
the
ark
if
i
change
them
it
will
be
but
to
humour
your
vanity
sweetheart
answered
her
father
i
bought
the
suit
in
paris
three
years
ago
and
i
swore
i
would
cast
them
back
upon
the
snip
hands
if
he
gave
me
any
finery
but
a
that
has
crossed
the
pyrenees
and
stood
a
winter
wear
at
montpelier
where
i
have
been
living
since
october
can
scarce
do
credit
to
a
fine
lady
saloon
and
thou
art
finest
i
wager
hyacinth
where
all
are
fine
you
would
not
say
that
if
you
had
seen
lady
castlemaine
rooms
i
would
wager
that
her
gold
and
silver
tapestry
cost
more
than
the
contents
of
my
house
thou
shouldst
not
envy
sin
in
high
places
hyacinth
envy
i
envy
a
nay
love
no
bad
names
is
a
sorry
pass
england
has
come
to
when
the
most
conspicuous
personage
at
her
court
is
the
king
mistress
i
was
with
queen
henrietta
at
paris
who
received
me
mighty
kindly
and
bewailed
with
me
over
the
contrast
betwixt
her
husband
and
his
sons
they
have
nothing
of
their
father
she
told
me
neither
in
person
nor
in
mind
know
not
whence
their
folly
comes
to
them
she
cried
it
would
have
been
uncivil
to
remind
her
that
her
own
father
hero
as
he
was
had
set
no
saintly
example
to
royal
husbands
and
that
it
is
possible
our
princes
take
more
of
their
character
from
their
grandfather
henry
than
from
the
martyr
charles
poor
lady
i
am
told
she
left
london
deep
in
debt
after
squandering
her
noble
income
of
these
latter
years
and
that
she
has
sunk
in
the
esteem
of
the
french
court
by
her
alliance
with
jermyn
i
can
but
wonder
that
she
above
all
women
should
ever
cease
to
be
a
widow
she
comes
of
a
race
and
nation
angela
and
it
is
easy
to
her
to
forget
or
she
would
not
easily
forget
that
husband
whose
fortunes
she
ruined
his
most
fatal
errors
came
from
his
subservience
to
her
when
i
saw
her
in
her
new
splendour
at
somerset
house
all
smiles
and
gaiety
with
youth
and
beauty
revived
in
the
sunshine
of
restored
fortune
i
could
but
remember
all
he
was
in
dignity
and
manly
affection
proud
and
pure
as
king
arthur
in
the
old
romance
and
all
she
cost
him
by
womanish
tyrannies
and
prejudices
and
difficult
commands
laid
upon
him
at
a
juncture
of
so
exceeding
difficulty
the
sisters
listened
in
respectful
silence
the
old
cavalier
cut
a
fresh
slice
of
chine
sighed
and
continued
his
sermon
i
doubt
that
while
we
the
lookers
on
remember
they
the
actors
forget
for
could
the
son
of
such
a
noble
victim
wallow
in
a
profligate
court
surrender
himself
to
the
devilish
necromancies
of
vicious
women
and
viler
men
if
he
remembered
his
father
character
and
his
father
death
no
memory
must
be
a
blank
and
we
who
suffered
with
our
royal
master
are
fools
to
prate
of
ingratitude
or
neglect
since
the
son
who
can
forget
such
a
father
may
well
forget
his
father
servants
and
friends
but
we
will
not
talk
of
public
matters
in
the
first
hour
of
our
greeting
nor
need
i
prate
of
the
king
since
i
have
not
come
back
to
england
to
clap
a
periwig
over
my
grey
hairs
and
play
waiter
upon
court
favour
and
wear
out
the
back
of
my
coat
against
the
tapestry
at
whitehall
standing
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
to
have
my
toes
trampled
upon
by
the
sharp
heels
of
court
ladies
and
an
elbow
in
my
stomach
more
often
than
not
i
am
come
like
wolsey
girls
to
lay
my
old
bones
among
you
art
thou
ready
angela
hast
thou
had
enough
of
london
and
and
parks
and
wilt
thou
share
thy
father
solitude
in
buckinghamshire
with
all
my
heart
sir
what
never
a
sigh
for
london
pleasures
thou
hast
the
great
lady
air
and
carriage
in
that
brave
blue
taffety
the
nun
i
knew
three
years
ago
has
vanished
can
you
so
lightly
renounce
the
splendour
of
this
house
and
your
sister
company
to
make
a
prosing
old
father
happy
indeed
sir
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
how
she
says
that
with
what
a
countenance
of
woeful
resignation
but
i
will
not
make
the
manor
moat
too
severe
a
prison
dearest
you
shall
visit
london
and
your
sister
when
you
will
there
shall
be
a
coach
and
a
team
of
stout
roadsters
to
pull
it
when
they
are
not
wanted
for
the
plough
and
the
vale
of
aylesbury
is
but
a
long
day
journey
from
london
while
is
no
more
than
a
morning
ride
to
chilton
i
could
not
bear
for
her
to
be
long
away
from
me
said
hyacinth
she
is
the
only
companion
i
have
in
the
world
except
your
husband
husbands
such
as
mine
are
poor
company
fareham
has
a
moody
brow
and
a
mind
stuffed
with
public
matters
he
dines
with
clarendon
one
day
and
with
albemarle
another
or
he
goes
to
deptford
to
grumble
with
evelyn
or
he
creeps
away
to
some
obscure
quarter
of
the
town
to
with
milton
and
with
marvel
the
member
for
hull
i
doubt
they
are
all
of
one
mind
in
abusing
his
majesty
and
conspiring
against
him
if
i
lose
my
sister
i
shall
have
no
one
what
no
one
when
you
have
henriette
who
even
three
years
ago
had
shrewdness
enough
to
keep
an
old
grandfather
amused
with
her
impertinent
prattle
grandfathers
are
easily
amused
by
children
they
see
as
seldom
as
you
have
seen
papillon
to
have
her
about
you
all
day
with
her
everlasting
chatter
and
questions
and
remarks
and
opinions
a
brat
of
twelve
with
opinions
would
soon
give
you
the
vapours
i
am
not
so
subject
to
vapours
as
you
child
let
me
look
at
you
now
the
candles
are
lighted
the
footmen
had
lighted
clusters
of
wax
candles
on
either
side
the
tall
sir
john
drew
his
elder
daughter
to
the
light
and
scrutinised
her
face
with
a
father
privilege
of
uncompromising
survey
you
paint
thick
enough
i
conscience
name
though
not
quite
so
thick
as
the
spanish
se√±oras
they
are
browner
than
you
and
need
a
heavier
hand
with
white
and
red
but
you
are
haggard
under
all
your
red
you
are
not
the
woman
i
left
in
i
am
near
two
years
older
than
the
woman
you
left
and
as
for
paint
there
is
not
a
woman
over
twenty
in
london
who
uses
as
little
red
and
white
as
i
do
what
has
become
of
fareham
sir
john
asked
presently
when
hyacinth
had
picked
up
her
favourite
spaniel
to
nurse
and
fondle
while
angela
had
resumed
her
occupation
at
an
embroidery
frame
and
a
reposeful
air
as
of
a
domesticity
had
fallen
upon
the
scene
he
is
at
chilton
when
he
is
not
plotting
he
rushes
off
to
oxfordshire
for
the
hunting
and
shooting
he
loves
buglehorns
and
yelping
curs
and
huntsmen
cracked
voices
far
before
the
company
of
ladies
or
the
conversation
of
wits
a
man
was
never
meant
to
sit
in
a
velvet
chair
and
talk
fine
it
is
all
one
for
a
french
abb√©
and
a
few
old
women
in
men
clothing
to
sit
round
the
room
and
chop
logic
with
a
learned
spinster
like
mademoiselle
scud√©ry
but
men
must
live
unless
they
are
statesmen
or
clerks
they
must
have
horses
and
hounds
gun
and
spaniel
hawk
or
rod
i
am
glad
fareham
loves
sport
and
as
for
that
talk
of
conspiring
let
me
not
hear
it
from
thee
hyacinth
is
a
perilous
discourse
to
but
hint
at
treason
and
your
husband
is
a
loyal
gentleman
who
loves
and
with
a
wry
face
reveres
his
king
oh
i
was
only
jesting
but
indeed
a
man
who
so
disparages
the
things
other
people
love
must
needs
be
a
rebel
at
heart
did
you
hear
of
monsieur
de
malfort
while
you
were
at
paris
the
inquiry
was
made
with
that
carelessness
which
betrays
hidden
pain
but
the
soldier
senses
had
been
blunted
by
the
of
an
adventurer
life
and
he
was
not
on
the
alert
for
shades
of
feeling
angela
accepted
her
father
return
with
the
new
duties
it
imposed
upon
her
as
if
it
had
been
a
decree
of
heaven
she
put
aside
all
consideration
of
that
refuge
which
would
have
meant
so
complete
a
renunciation
and
farewell
on
her
knees
that
night
in
the
midst
of
fervent
prayers
her
tears
streamed
fast
at
the
thought
that
secure
in
the
shelter
of
her
father
love
in
the
peaceful
solitude
of
her
native
valley
she
could
look
to
a
future
when
she
and
fareham
might
meet
with
out
fear
of
sin
when
no
cloud
of
passion
should
darken
his
brotherly
affection
for
her
when
his
heart
now
estranged
from
holy
things
would
have
returned
to
the
faith
of
his
ancestors
reconciled
to
god
and
the
church
she
could
but
think
of
him
now
as
a
fallen
angel
a
wanderer
who
had
strayed
far
from
the
only
light
and
guide
of
human
life
and
was
thus
a
mark
for
the
tempter
what
lesser
power
than
satan
could
have
so
turned
good
to
evil
the
friendship
of
a
brother
to
the
base
passion
which
had
made
so
wide
a
gulf
between
them
and
which
must
keep
them
strangers
till
he
was
cured
of
his
sin
only
to
diabolical
possession
could
she
ascribe
the
change
that
had
come
over
him
since
those
happy
days
when
she
had
watched
the
slow
dawn
of
health
upon
his
sunken
cheeks
when
he
and
she
had
travelled
together
through
the
rich
autumn
woods
along
the
pleasant
english
roads
and
when
in
the
leisure
of
the
slow
journey
he
had
poured
out
his
thoughts
to
her
the
story
of
his
life
his
opinions
expatiating
in
fraternal
confidence
upon
the
things
he
loved
and
the
things
he
hated
and
at
chilton
she
looked
back
and
remembered
his
goodness
to
her
the
pains
he
had
taken
in
choosing
horses
for
her
to
ride
their
long
mornings
on
the
river
with
henriette
their
hawking
parties
and
in
all
his
tender
brotherly
care
of
her
the
change
in
him
had
come
about
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
but
it
had
been
chiefly
marked
by
a
fitful
temper
that
had
cut
her
to
the
quick
now
kind
now
barely
civil
courting
her
company
avoiding
her
as
if
there
were
contagion
in
her
presence
then
after
the
meeting
at
millbank
there
had
come
a
coldness
so
icy
a
sarcasm
so
cutting
that
for
a
long
time
she
had
thought
he
hated
as
much
as
he
despised
her
she
had
withered
in
his
contempt
his
unkindness
had
overshadowed
every
hour
of
her
life
and
the
longing
to
cry
out
to
him
indeed
sir
your
thoughts
wrong
me
i
am
not
the
wretch
you
think
had
been
almost
too
much
for
her
fortitude
she
had
felt
that
she
must
exculpate
herself
even
though
in
so
doing
she
should
betray
her
sister
but
honour
and
affection
for
hyacinth
had
prevailed
and
she
had
bent
her
shoulders
to
the
burden
of
undeserved
shame
she
had
sat
silent
and
abashed
in
his
presence
like
a
guilty
creature
sir
john
kirkland
spent
a
week
at
fareham
house
employed
in
choosing
a
team
of
horses
suitable
alike
for
the
road
and
the
plough
looking
out
among
the
coachmakers
for
a
travelling
carriage
and
eventually
buying
a
coach
of
lady
fanshawe
which
had
been
brought
from
madrid
with
the
rest
of
her
very
extensive
goods
and
chattels
one
need
scarce
remark
that
it
was
not
one
of
the
late
ambassador
state
carriages
his
ruby
velvet
coach
with
fringes
that
cost
three
hundred
pounds
or
his
brocade
carriage
but
a
coach
that
had
been
built
for
the
everyday
use
of
his
suite
sir
john
also
bought
a
little
plain
silver
in
place
of
that
fine
collection
of
silver
and
which
had
been
so
willingly
sacrificed
to
royal
necessities
and
though
he
breathed
no
sigh
over
past
losses
some
bitter
thoughts
may
have
come
across
his
cheerfulness
as
he
heard
of
the
splendour
and
superabundance
of
lady
castlemaine
plate
and
jewels
or
of
the
ring
worth
six
hundred
pounds
lately
presented
to
a
pretty
actress
in
a
week
he
was
ready
for
buckinghamshire
and
angela
had
her
trunks
packed
and
had
bid
to
her
london
friends
amidst
the
chatter
of
lady
fareham
and
the
clear
clash
of
delicate
china
miniature
bowls
of
porcelain
without
handles
and
to
be
held
daintily
between
the
tips
of
fingers
there
was
a
chorus
of
courteous
bewailing
at
the
notion
of
departure
sir
ralph
masaroon
pretended
to
be
in
despair
is
it
not
bad
enough
to
have
had
the
coldest
winter
my
youth
can
remember
but
you
must
needs
take
the
sun
from
our
spring
why
the
maids
of
honour
will
count
for
handsome
when
you
are
gone
what
that
butler
says
twinkling
stars
begin
to
muster
and
glitter
with
their
borrowed
lustre
but
what
to
become
of
me
without
the
sun
i
shall
have
no
one
to
in
the
ring
indeed
sir
ralph
i
did
not
know
that
you
ever
me
what
you
have
suffered
my
devotion
to
pass
unperceived
when
i
have
broken
half
a
dozen
coach
windows
in
your
service
rattling
a
glass
down
with
a
vehemence
which
would
have
startled
a
venus
in
marble
to
turn
and
recognise
an
adorer
round
and
round
the
ring
i
have
driven
for
hours
on
the
chance
of
a
look
nay
marble
is
not
so
coy
as
froward
beauty
and
at
the
queen
chapel
have
i
not
knelt
at
the
mass
morning
after
morning
at
the
risk
of
being
thought
a
papist
for
the
sake
of
seeing
you
at
prayers
and
have
envied
the
romish
dog
who
handed
you
the
aspersoir
as
you
went
out
and
you
to
be
unconscious
all
the
time
nay
is
so
much
happier
for
me
sir
ralph
since
you
have
given
me
a
reserve
of
gratified
vanity
that
will
last
me
a
year
in
the
country
where
i
shall
see
nothing
but
ploughmen
and
look
out
for
the
scarecrows
in
sir
john
fields
for
the
odds
are
you
will
see
me
some
day
disguised
as
one
why
disguised
asked
his
friend
penington
who
had
lately
produced
a
comedy
that
had
been
acted
three
afternoons
at
the
duke
theatre
and
one
evening
at
court
which
may
be
taken
as
a
prosperous
run
for
a
new
play
lady
sarah
tewkesbury
held
forth
on
the
pleasures
of
a
country
life
and
lamented
that
family
connections
and
the
necessity
of
standing
well
with
the
court
constrained
her
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
her
existence
in
town
i
am
like
milton
she
said
i
adore
a
rural
life
to
hear
the
cock
his
watchtower
in
the
skies
when
the
horse
and
hound
do
rise
oh
i
love
buttercups
and
daisies
above
all
the
paris
finery
in
the
exchange
and
to
steep
one
complexion
in
and
to
sup
on
a
syllabub
or
a
dish
of
frumenty
so
cheap
too
while
it
costs
a
fortune
but
to
scrape
along
in
london
the
country
is
well
enough
for
a
month
at
to
romp
with
a
bevy
of
london
beauties
in
the
meadows
near
tunbridge
wells
or
to
dance
to
a
couple
of
fiddles
on
the
common
by
moonlight
said
penington
whereupon
all
agreed
that
tunbridge
wells
epsom
doncaster
and
newmarket
were
the
only
country
possible
to
people
of
intellect
i
would
never
go
further
than
epsom
if
i
had
my
will
said
sir
ralph
for
i
see
no
pleasure
in
newmarket
for
a
man
who
keeps
no
and
has
no
more
interest
in
the
upshot
of
a
race
than
he
might
have
in
a
maggot
match
on
his
own
did
he
stake
high
enough
on
the
result
but
my
sister
is
not
to
be
buried
in
buckinghamshire
all
the
year
round
explained
hyacinth
i
shall
fetch
her
here
half
a
dozen
times
in
a
season
and
her
shortest
visits
must
be
long
enough
to
take
the
country
freshness
out
of
her
complexion
and
save
her
from
becoming
a
milkmaid
gud
to
see
her
freckled
cried
penington
i
could
as
soon
imagine
helen
with
a
hump
that
london
pallor
is
the
choicest
charm
in
a
girl
of
quality
a
refined
sickliness
that
appeals
to
the
heart
of
a
man
of
feeling
an
sort
of
air
your
country
hoyden
with
her
complexion
and
manners
is
more
shocking
than
medusa
to
a
man
of
taste
the
talk
drifted
to
other
topics
at
the
mention
of
buckingham
who
had
but
lately
been
let
out
of
the
tower
where
he
and
lord
dorchester
had
been
committed
for
scuffling
and
quarrelling
at
the
canary
conference
has
your
ladyship
seen
the
duke
and
lord
dorchester
since
they
came
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
asked
lady
sarah
i
think
buckingham
was
never
so
gay
and
handsome
and
takes
his
imprisonment
as
the
best
joke
that
ever
was
and
is
as
great
at
court
as
ever
his
majesty
is
but
too
indulgent
said
masaroon
and
encourages
the
duke
to
be
insolent
and
careless
of
ceremony
he
had
the
impertinence
to
show
himself
at
chapel
before
he
had
waited
on
his
majesty
who
was
very
angry
and
forbade
him
the
court
said
penington
but
buckingham
sent
the
king
one
of
his
foolish
jesting
letters
capped
with
a
rhyme
or
two
and
if
you
can
make
charles
stuart
laugh
you
may
pick
his
pocket
or
seduce
his
mistress
oh
he
will
forgive
much
to
wit
and
gaiety
he
learnt
the
knack
of
taking
life
easily
while
he
led
that
queer
shifting
life
in
exile
he
was
a
cosmopolitan
and
a
soldier
of
fortune
before
he
was
a
king
facto
and
still
wears
the
loose
garments
of
those
easy
beggarly
days
when
he
had
neither
money
nor
care
be
sure
he
regrets
that
roving
life
madrid
paris
the
hague
and
will
never
love
a
son
as
well
as
little
monmouth
the
child
of
his
youth
what
would
he
not
give
to
make
that
brat
prince
of
wales
strange
that
while
lord
ross
is
trying
to
make
his
offspring
illegitimate
by
act
of
parliament
his
master
anxieties
should
all
tend
the
other
way
do
talk
to
me
of
parliament
cried
lady
sarah
the
tyranny
of
the
rump
was
nothing
to
them
look
at
the
tax
upon
french
wines
which
will
make
it
almost
impossible
for
a
lady
of
small
means
to
entertain
her
friends
and
an
act
for
burying
us
all
in
woollen
for
the
benefit
of
the
english
trade
in
wool
but
indeed
lady
sarah
it
is
we
of
the
old
faith
who
have
most
need
to
complain
said
lady
fareham
since
these
wretches
make
us
pay
a
double
and
all
our
foreign
friends
are
being
driven
away
for
the
same
reason
just
because
the
foolish
and
the
ignorant
must
needs
put
down
the
fire
to
the
catholics
indeed
your
ladyship
the
papists
have
had
an
unlucky
knack
at
lighting
fires
as
smithfield
and
oxford
can
testify
said
penington
and
perhaps
having
no
more
opportunity
of
roasting
martyrs
it
may
please
some
of
your
creed
to
burn
protestant
houses
with
the
chance
of
cooking
a
few
protestants
inside
angela
had
drawn
away
from
the
little
knot
of
fine
ladies
and
finer
gentlemen
and
was
sitting
in
the
bay
window
of
an
with
henriette
and
the
boy
who
were
sorely
dejected
at
the
prospect
of
losing
her
the
best
consolation
she
could
offer
was
to
promise
that
they
should
be
invited
to
the
manor
moat
as
soon
as
she
and
her
father
had
settled
themselves
comfortably
there
if
their
mother
could
spare
them
henriette
laughed
outright
at
this
final
clause
spare
us
she
cried
does
she
ever
want
us
i
do
think
she
knows
when
we
are
in
the
room
unless
we
tread
upon
her
gown
when
she
screams
out
viper
and
hits
us
with
her
fan
the
lightest
touch
papillon
not
so
hard
as
you
strike
your
favourite
baby
oh
she
does
hurt
me
but
the
disrespect
of
it
her
only
daughter
and
nearly
as
high
as
she
is
you
are
an
ungrateful
puss
to
complain
when
her
ladyship
is
so
kind
as
to
let
you
be
here
to
see
all
her
fine
company
i
am
sick
of
her
company
almost
always
the
same
and
always
talking
about
the
same
things
the
king
and
the
duke
and
the
general
and
the
navy
or
lady
castlemaine
jewels
or
the
last
new
head
from
paris
or
her
ladyship
flanders
lace
it
is
all
as
dull
as
now
monsieur
de
malfort
is
gone
he
was
always
pleasant
and
he
let
me
play
on
his
guitar
though
he
swore
it
excruciated
him
and
he
taught
me
the
new
versailles
coranto
there
no
pleasure
for
any
one
since
he
fell
ill
and
left
england
you
shall
come
to
the
manor
it
will
be
a
change
even
though
you
hate
the
country
and
love
london
i
have
left
off
loving
london
i
have
had
too
much
of
it
if
his
lordship
let
us
go
to
the
often
it
would
be
different
oh
how
i
loved
philaster
and
that
exquisite
page
do
you
think
i
could
act
that
character
auntie
if
his
lordship
tailor
made
me
such
a
dress
i
think
thou
hast
impudence
for
anything
dearest
i
would
rather
act
that
page
than
pauline
in
though
mademoiselle
swears
i
speak
her
tirades
nearly
as
well
as
an
actress
she
once
saw
at
the
marais
who
was
too
old
and
fat
for
the
character
how
i
should
love
to
be
an
actress
and
to
play
tragedy
and
comedy
and
make
people
cry
and
laugh
indeed
i
would
rather
be
anything
than
a
lady
unless
i
could
be
exactly
like
lady
castlemaine
ah
heaven
forbid
but
why
not
i
heard
sir
ralph
tell
mother
that
let
her
behave
as
badly
as
she
may
she
will
always
be
atop
of
the
tree
and
that
the
young
sparks
at
the
chapel
royal
hardly
look
at
their
for
gazing
at
her
and
that
the
king
ah
sweetheart
i
want
to
hear
no
more
of
her
why
do
you
like
her
i
thought
you
did
not
know
her
she
never
comes
here
are
there
any
staghounds
in
the
vale
of
aylesbury
asked
the
boy
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
watching
the
boats
go
by
unheeding
his
sister
babble
i
know
not
love
but
there
shall
be
dogs
enough
for
you
to
play
with
i
warrant
and
a
pony
for
you
to
ride
grandfather
shall
get
them
for
his
dearest
sir
john
was
fond
of
henriette
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
marvel
of
precocious
brightness
but
the
boy
was
his
favourite

he
loved
with
an
old
man

for

the

house
in

differed
in
every
detail
from
the
historical
chilton
abbey
it
was
a
moated
manor
house
the
typical

of
the
typical

an
house
with
a
capacious
roof
that
lodged
all
the

servants
and
clustered
that
accommodated
a
great
company
of
swallows
it
had
been
built
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
seventh
and
was
coeval
with
its
distinguished
neighbour
the
house
of
the
verneys
at

it
had
never
served
any
other
purpose
than
to

over

but
the
end
of
the
civil
war
was
but
a
memory
when
the
manor
house
was
built
after
bosworth
a
slumberous
peace
had
fallen
on
the
land
and
in
the
stillness
of
this
secluded
valley
sheltered
from
every
bleak
wind
by
surrounding
hills
and
woods
the
gardens
of
the
manor
moat
had
grown
into
a
settled
beauty
that
made
the
chief
attraction
of
a
country
seat
which
boasted
so
little
of
architectural
dignity
or
of
expensive
fantasy
in

plain
sombre

the

stood
in

midst
of
gardens
such
as
the
modern
millionaire
may
long
for
but
which
only
the
grey
old
gardener
time
can
create
there
was
more
than
a

in
flower

and
physic
garden
the

the

of
the

the

a

of

which

verily
a

of

but
when
angela
came
there
in
the
chill
february
there
were
no
flowers
to
welcome
her
only
the
long
straight
walks
beside
those
walls
of
yew
and
the
dark
shining
waters
of
the
moat
and
the
reflecting
the
winter
sun
and
over
all
the
scene
a
quiet
as
of
the
grave
a
little
colony
of
old
servants
had
been
left
in
the
house
which
had
escaped
confiscation
albeit
the
property
of
a
notorious
malignant
perhaps
chiefly
on
account
of
its
insignificance
the
bulk
of
the
estate
having
been
sold
by
sir
john
in
when
the
king
condition
was
waxing
desperate
and
money
was
worth
twice
its
value
to
those
who
clung
to
hope
and
were
ready
to
sacrifice
their
last
jacobus
in
the
royal
cause
the
poor
little
property
shrunk
to
a
of
ninety
acres
a
humble
homestead
and
the
manor
house
may
have
been
thought
hardly
worth
selling
or
sir
john
rights
may
have
been
respected
out
of
regard
for
his
who
on
the
maternal
side
had
kindred
in
high
places
under
the
commonwealth
a
fact
of
which
hyacinth
occasionally
reminded
her
husband
telling
him
that
he
was
by
hereditary
instinct
a
rebel
and
a
the
farm
had
been
taken
to
by
sir
john
steward
a
man
who
in
politics
was
of
the
same
easy
temper
as
the
vicar
of
bray
in
religion
and
was
a
staunch
cromwellian
so
long
as
oliver
or
richard
sat
at
whitehall
or
would
have
tossed
up
his
cap
and
cheered
for
monk
as
of
great
britain
had
he
been
called
upon
to
till
his
fields
and
rear
his
stock
under
a
military
despotism
it
mattered
little
to
any
man
living
at
ease
in
a
fat
buckinghamshire
valley
what
king
or
commonwealth
ruled
in
london
so
long
as
there
was
a
ready
market
at
aylesbury
or
thame
for
all
the
farm
could
produce
and
civil
war
planted
neither
drake
nor
culverin
on
brill
hill
the
old
servants
had
vegetated
as
best
they
might
in
the
old
house
their
wages
of
the
scantiest
but
to
live
and
die
within
familiar
walls
was
better
than
to
fare
through
a
world
which
had
no
need
of
them
the
younger
members
of
the
household
had
scattered
and
found
new
homes
but
the
cook
was
still
in
her
kitchen
the
old
butler
still
wept
over
his
pantry
where
a
dozen
or
so
of
spoons
and
one
battered
tankard
of
heriot
make
were
all
that
remained
of
that
store
of
gold
and
silver
which
had
been
his
pride
forty
years
ago
when
charles
was
bringing
home
his
fair
french
bride
and
old
thames
at
london
was
alight
with
and
torches
and
alive
with
music
and
singing
as
the
city
welcomed
its
young
queen
and
when
reuben
holden
was
a
lad
in
the
pantry
learning
to
polish
a
salver
or
a
goblet
and
sorely
hectored
by
his
uncle
the
butler
reuben
and
marjory
the
old
cook
famous
in
her
day
as
any
were
the
sole
representatives
of
the
once
respectable
household
but
a
couple
of
stout
wenches
had
been
hired
from
the
cluster
of
hovels
that
called
itself
a
village
and
these
had
been
made
to
drudge
as
they
had
never
drudged
before
in
the
few
days
of
warning
which
prepared
reuben
for
his
master
return
fires
had
been
lighted
in
rooms
where
mould
and
mildew
had
long
prevailed
wainscots
had
been
scrubbed
and
polished
till
the
whole
house
reeked
of
and
turpentine
to
a
degree
that
almost
overpowered
those
pervading
odours
of
damp
and
dry
rot
which
can
curiously
exist
together
the
old
furniture
had
been
made
as
bright
as
faded
fabrics
and
wood
could
be
made
by
labour
and
the
leaping
light
of
blazing
logs
reflected
on
the
black
oak
panelling
gave
a
transient
air
of
cheerfulness
to
the
spacious
where
sir
john
and
his
daughter
took
their
first
meal
in
the
old
home
and
if
to
angela
eye
accustomed
to
the
italian
loftiness
of
the
noble
mansions
on
the
thames
the
broad
oak
crossbeams
seemed
coming
down
upon
her
head
there
was
at
least
an
air
of
homely
snugness
in
the
low
darkly
coloured
room
on
that
first
evening
there
had
been
much
to
interest
and
engage
her
she
had
the
old
house
to
explore
and
dim
childish
memories
to
recall
here
was
the
room
where
her
mother
died
the
room
in
which
she
herself
had
first
seen
the
light
perhaps
not
until
a
month
or
so
after
her
birth
since
the
baby
was
not
flung
into
her
birthday
sunshine
but
was
swaddled
and
muffled
in
a
dismal
apprenticeship
to
life
the
chamber
had
been
hung
with
blacks
for
a
twelvemonth
reuben
told
her
as
he
escorted
her
over
the
house
and
unlocked
the
doors
of
disused
rooms
the
tall
bedstead
with
its
red
and
yellow
stamped
velvet
curtains
and
carved
ebony
posts
looked
like
an
indian
temple
one
might
expect
to
see
buddha
squatting
on
the
embroidered
counterpane
the
work
of
half
a
lifetime
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
a
huge
moth
flew
out
of
the
darkness
and
spun
and
wheeled
round
the
room
with
an
awful
humming
noise
and
to
the
superstitious
mind
might
have
suggested
a
human
soul
embodied
in
this
phantasmal
greyness
with
power
of
sound
in
such
excess
of
its
bulk
sir
john
never
used
the
room
after
her
ladyship
death
reuben
explained
though
is
the
best
he
has
always
slept
in
the
blue
room
which
is
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
gallery
from
the
room
that
has
been
prepared
for
madam
we
call
that
the
garden
room
and
it
is
mighty
pretty
in
summer
in
summer
how
far
it
seemed
to
in
angela
thoughts
what
a
long
gulf
of
nothingness
to
be
bridged
over
what
a
dull
level
plain
to
cross
before
june
and
the
roses
could
come
round
again
bringing
with
them
the
memory
of
last
summer
and
the
days
she
had
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
fareham
and
the
evenings
when
they
had
sat
in
the
same
room
or
loitered
on
the
terrace
pausing
now
and
then
beside
an
italian
vase
of
gaudy
flowers
to
look
at
this
or
that
or
to
watch
the
mob
on
the
river
and
those
rare
golden
days
like
that
at
sayes
court
which
she
had
spent
in
some
excursion
with
fareham
and
henriette
i
hope
madam
likes
the
chamber
we
have
prepared
for
her
the
old
man
said
as
she
stood
dreaming
yes
my
good
friend
it
is
very
comfortable
my
woman
complained
of
the
smoky
chimney
in
her
chamber
but
no
doubt
we
shall
mend
that
it
would
be
strange
if
a
gentlewoman
servant
found
not
something
to
grumble
about
said
reuben
they
have
ever
less
work
to
do
than
any
one
else
in
the
house
and
ever
make
more
trouble
than
their
mistresses
settle
the
hussy
with
madam
leave
nay
pray
reuben
no
harshness
she
is
a
willing
girl
and
we
shall
find
plenty
of
work
for
her
in
this
big
house
where
there
are
so
few
servants
oh
there
work
enough
for
sure
if
she
do
it
and
is
no
fine
city
madam
that
will
scream
at
sight
of
a
mouse
belike
she
is
a
girl
i
had
out
of
oxfordshire
oh
if
she
comes
out
of
oxfordshire
from
his
lordship
estate
i
dare
swear
she
is
a
good
girl
i
hate
your
london
trash
and
i
think
the
great
fire
would
have
been
a
blessing
in
disguise
if
it
had
swept
away
most
of
such
trumpery
oh
sir
if
a
romanist
were
to
say
as
much
as
that
said
angela
laughing
oh
madam
i
am
not
one
of
they
fools
that
say
because
half
london
was
burnt
the
papishes
must
have
set
it
on
fire
what
good
would
the
burning
of
it
do
poor
souls
and
now
they
are
to
pay
double
taxes
as
if
it
was
a
sure
thing
their
faggots
kindled
the
blaze
i
know
how
kind
and
sweet
a
soul
a
papish
may
be
though
she
do
worship
idols
for
i
had
the
honour
to
serve
your
ladyship
mother
from
the
hour
she
first
entered
this
house
till
the
day
i
smuggled
the
french
priest
by
the
back
stairs
to
carry
her
the
holy
oils
ah
she
was
a
noble
and
lovely
lady
madam
eyes
are
of
her
colour
and
indeed
madam
favours
her
mother
more
than
my
lady
fareham
does
have
you
seen
lady
fareham
of
late
years
ay
madam
she
came
here
in
her
the
summer
before
the
pestilence
with
her
two
beautiful
children
and
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
they
rode
here
from
his
grace
of
buckingham
new
mansion
by
the
thames
clefden
i
think
they
call
it
and
they
do
say
his
grace
do
so
lavish
and
squander
money
in
the
building
of
it
that
belike
he
will
be
ruined
and
dead
before
his
palace
be
finished
there
were
three
coaches
full
with
servants
and
what
not
and
they
brought
wine
and
capons
ready
dressed
and
confectionery
and
i
helped
to
serve
a
collation
for
them
in
the
garden
and
after
they
had
feasted
merrily
with
a
vast
quantity
of
sparkling
french
wine
they
all
rushed
through
the
house
like
madcaps
laughing
and
chattering
regular
french
magpies
for
there
was
more
of
french
than
english
her
ladyship
leading
them
till
she
comes
to
the
door
of
this
room
and
finds
it
locked
and
she
begins
to
thump
upon
the
panels
like
a
spoilt
child
and
calls
reuben
what
is
your
mystery
sure
this
must
be
the
open
open
instantly
and
i
answered
her
quietly
the
chamber
where
that
sweet
angel
your
ladyship
mother
lay
in
state
and
it
has
never
been
opened
to
strangers
since
she
died
and
all
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
the
dear
young
lady
burst
out
weeping
and
cried
sweet
sweet
mother
i
remember
the
last
smile
she
gave
me
as
if
it
was
yesterday
and
then
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
crossed
herself
and
whispered
a
prayer
with
her
face
close
against
the
door
and
i
knew
that
she
was
praying
for
her
as
the
way
of
your
religion
is
madam
to
pray
for
the
dead
and
sure
though
it
is
a
simple
thing
it
can
do
no
harm
and
to
my
thinking
when
all
the
foolishness
is
taken
out
of
religion
the
warmth
and
the
comfort
seem
to
go
too
for
i
know
i
never
used
to
feel
a
bit
more
comfortable
after
a
two
hours
sermon
when
i
was
an
anabaptist
are
you
not
an
anabaptist
now
reuben
lord
forbid
madam
i
have
been
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
ever
since
his
majesty
restoration
brought
the
vicar
to
his
own
again
and
gave
us
back
christmas
day
and
the
organ
and
the
angela
life
at
the
manor
was
so
colourless
that
the
first
blossoming
of
a
familiar
flower
was
an
event
to
note
and
to
remember
life
within
convent
walls
would
have
been
scarcely
more
tranquil
or
more
monotonous
sir
john
rode
with
his
hounds
three
or
four
times
a
week
or
was
about
the
fields
superintending
the
farming
operations
walking
beside
the
ploughman
as
he
drove
his
furrow
or
watching
the
scattering
of
the
seed
or
he
was
in
the
narrow
woodlands
which
still
belonged
to
him
and
angela
taking
her
solitary
walk
at
the
close
of
day
heard
his
axe
ringing
through
the
wintry
air
it
was
a
peaceful
and
should
have
been
a
pleasant
life
for
father
and
for
daughter
angela
told
herself
that
god
had
been
very
good
to
her
in
providing
this
safe
haven
from
tempestuous
seas
this
quiet
little
world
where
the
pulses
of
passion
beat
not
where
existence
was
like
a
sleep
a
gradual
drifting
away
of
days
and
weeks
marked
only
by
the
changing
note
of
birds
the
deepening
umber
on
the
birch
the
purpling
of
beech
buds
and
the
starry
celandine
shining
out
of
grassy
banks
that
had
so
lately
been
obliterated
under
the
drifted
snow
i
ought
to
be
happy
she
said
to
herself
of
a
morning
when
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
stood
looking
across
the
garden
to
the
grassy
hills
beyond
while
the
beads
of
her
rosary
slipped
through
her
languid
fingers
i
ought
to
be
happy
and
then
she
turned
from
the
sunny
window
with
a
sigh
and
went
down
the
dark
echoing
staircase
to
the
breakfast
parlour
where
her
own
little
silver
looked
ridiculously
small
beside
sir
john
quart
tankard
and
where
the
crisp
golden
rolls
baked
in
the
french
fashion
by
the
maid
from
chilton
who
had
been
taught
by
lord
fareham
contrasted
with
the
chine
of
beef
and
huge
farmhouse
loaf
that
accompanied
the
knight
old
october
after
all
his
continental
wanderings
sir
john
had
come
back
to
substantial
english
fare
with
an
unabated
relish
and
angela
had
to
sit
down
day
after
day
to
a
huge
joint
and
an
overloaded
dish
of
poultry
and
to
reassure
her
father
when
he
expressed
uneasiness
because
she
ate
so
little
women
do
not
want
much
food
sir
martha
rolls
and
our
honey
and
the
conserves
old
marjory
makes
so
well
are
better
for
me
than
the
meat
which
suits
your
heartier
appetite
faith
child
if
i
played
no
stouter
a
part
at
table
than
you
do
i
should
soon
be
fit
to
play
living
skeleton
at
aylesbury
fair
and
i
dubitate
as
to
your
and
confectionery
suiting
you
better
than
a
slice
of
chine
or
sirloin
for
you
have
a
pale
cheek
and
a
pensive
eye
that
smite
me
to
the
heart
indeed
i
begin
to
question
if
i
was
kind
to
take
you
from
all
the
pleasures
of
the
town
to
be
mewed
up
here
with
a
rusty
old
soldier
indeed
sir
i
could
be
happier
nowhere
than
here
i
have
had
enough
of
london
pleasures
and
i
was
meditating
upon
returning
to
the
convent
when
you
came
to
put
an
end
to
all
my
perplexities
and
sir
i
think
god
sent
you
to
me
when
i
most
needed
a
father
love
she
went
to
him
and
knelt
by
his
chair
hiding
her
tearful
eyes
against
the
cushioned
arm
but
though
he
could
not
see
her
face
he
heard
the
break
in
her
voice
and
he
bent
down
and
lifted
her
drooping
head
on
his
breast
and
kissed
the
soft
brown
hair
and
embraced
her
very
tenderly
sweetheart
thou
hast
all
a
father
love
and
it
is
happiness
to
me
to
have
thee
here
but
old
as
i
am
and
with
so
little
cunning
to
read
a
maiden
heart
i
can
read
clear
enough
to
know
thou
art
not
happy
whisper
dearest
is
it
a
sweetheart
who
sighs
for
thy
favours
far
off
and
will
not
beard
this
old
lion
in
his
den
my
gentle
angela
would
make
no
ill
choice
fear
not
to
trust
me
my
heart
i
will
love
whom
you
love
favour
whom
you
favour
i
am
no
tyrant
that
my
sweet
daughter
should
grow
pale
with
keeping
secrets
from
me
dear
father
you
are
all
goodness
no
there
is
no
one
no
one
i
am
happy
with
you
i
have
no
one
in
the
world
but
you
and
in
a
so
much
lesser
degree
of
love
my
sister
and
her
children
and
fareham
he
should
be
to
you
as
a
brother
he
is
of
a
black
melancholic
humour
and
not
a
man
whom
women
love
but
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
and
must
regard
you
with
grateful
affection
for
your
goodness
to
him
when
he
was
sick
hyacinth
is
never
weary
of
expatiating
upon
your
devotion
in
that
perilous
time
she
is
foolish
to
talk
of
services
i
would
have
given
as
willingly
to
a
sick
beggar
angela
answered
impatiently
her
face
was
still
hidden
against
her
father
breast
but
she
lifted
her
head
presently
and
the
pale
calmness
of
her
countenance
reassured
him
well
it
is
uncommon
strange
he
said
if
one
so
fair
has
no
sweetheart
among
all
the
sparks
of
whitehall
lord
fareham
hates
whitehall
we
have
only
attended
there
at
great
festivals
when
my
sister
absence
would
have
been
a
slight
upon
her
majesty
and
the
duchess
but
my
star
though
seldom
shining
there
should
have
drawn
some
satellites
to
her
orbit
you
see
dearest
i
can
catch
the
note
of
court
flattery
nay
i
will
press
no
questions
my
girl
shall
choose
her
own
partner
provided
the
man
is
honest
and
a
loyal
servant
of
the
king
her
old
father
shall
set
no
in
the
to
her
happiness
what
right
has
one
who
is
almost
a
pauper
to
stipulate
for
a
wealthy
chapter
xxiii
patient
not
passionate
the
quiet
days
went
on
and
the
old
cavalier
settled
down
into
a
tranquil
happiness
which
comforted
his
daughter
with
the
feeling
of
duty
prosperously
fulfilled
to
make
this
dear
old
man
happy
to
be
his
companion
and
friend
to
share
in
his
rides
and
rambles
and
of
an
evening
to
play
the
games
he
loved
on
the
old
in
the
hall
or
an
game
at
cards
or
backgammon
beside
the
fire
in
the
panelled
parlour
reconciled
her
to
the
melancholy
of
an
existence
from
which
hope
had
vanished
like
a
light
extinguished
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
dropped
back
into
the
old
life
with
her
the
manor
house
was
just
a
little
gayer
than
the
flemish
convent
for
the
voices
and
footsteps
of
the
few
inhabitants
had
a
freer
sound
which
made
the
few
seem
more
populous
than
the
many
and
then
there
were
the
dogs
what
a
powerful
factor
in
home
life
those
friends
were
a
stone
barn
had
been
turned
into
a
kennel
for
five
couple
of
foxhounds
indoors
a
couple
of
setters
sent
by
a
friend
over
sea
from
waterford
had
insinuated
themselves
into
the
parlour
where
they
established
themselves
as
household
favourites
to
the
damage
of
those
higher
hereditary
qualities
which
fitted
them
for
distinction
with
the
guns
indeed
the
old
knight
was
too
fond
of
his
fireside
companions
to
care
very
much
if
he
missed
a
bird
now
and
then
because
cataline
was
or
caesar
disobedient
they
stood
sentinel
on
each
side
of
his
chair
at
dinner
like
supporters
to
a
angela
had
her
own
particular
favourite
in
a
king
charles
spaniel
it
was
the
very
dog
which
had
first
greeted
her
in
the
silence
of
the
house
she
had
chosen
this
one
from
the
canine
troop
when
her
sister
offered
her
the
gift
of
a
dog
at
parting
though
hyacinth
had
urged
her
to
take
something
younger
than
this
which
was
over
five
years
old
he
will
die
just
when
you
love
him
best
she
said
nay
but
such
partings
must
come
i
love
this
one
because
he
was
with
me
in
fear
and
sadness
he
used
to
cling
to
me
and
look
up
and
lick
my
face
as
if
he
were
telling
me
to
hope
when
my
brother
seemed
marked
for
death
poor
fareham
did
you
desire
every
dog
in
the
house
and
my
spaniels
are
of
the
same
breed
as
the
king
and
worth
fifty
pound
apiece
you
have
a
right
to
take
them
but
indeed
i
would
rather
you
chose
a
younger
dog
and
with
a
shorter
nose
but
of
course
if
you
like
this
one
best
angela
held
by
her
first
choice
and
ganymede
was
the
companion
of
all
her
hours
walked
and
lived
with
her
and
slept
on
a
satin
cushion
at
the
foot
of
her
spacious
bed
and
fretted
and
whined
if
she
left
him
shut
in
an
empty
room
for
half
an
hour
yet
with
all
his
refinements
and
his
air
of
being
as
dainty
a
gentleman
as
any
spark
of
quality
he
had
a
gross
passion
for
the
kitchen
and
after
nibbling
sweet
cakes
delicately
out
of
his
mistress
taper
fingers
he
would
waddle
through
a
labyrinth
of
passages
and
find
his
way
to
the
there
to
wallow
in
slush
and
broken
victuals
till
he
all
but
drowned
himself
in
a
flood
of
it
was
hard
to
reconcile
so
much
beauty
and
grace
such
eloquent
eyes
and
satin
coat
with
tastes
and
desires
so
vulgar
and
angela
sighed
over
him
when
a
scullion
brought
him
to
her
greasy
and
penitent
to
crouch
at
her
feet
and
deprecate
her
disgust
with
an
abject
tail
oh
tranquil
duteous
life
how
fair
it
might
have
seemed
as
spring
advanced
and
the
garden
smiled
with
the
promise
of
summer
were
it
not
for
that
aching
sense
of
loss
the
some
one
missing
whose
absence
made
all
things
grey
and
cold
yes
she
knew
now
fully
realising
as
she
had
never
done
before
how
long
and
how
utterly
her
life
had
been
influenced
by
an
affection
which
even
to
contemplate
was
mortal
sin
yet
to
extinguish
memory
was
not
within
her
power
she
looked
back
and
remembered
how
fareham
protecting
love
had
enfolded
her
with
its
gentle
warmth
in
those
happy
days
at
chilton
how
all
she
knew
of
poetry
and
the
drama
of
ethics
and
philosophy
had
been
learnt
from
him
she
recalled
his
evident
delight
in
opening
the
rich
treasures
of
a
mind
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
cultivate
even
amidst
the
vicissitudes
of
a
soldier
life
in
making
her
familiar
with
the
writers
he
loved
and
teaching
her
to
estimate
and
to
discuss
them
and
in
all
their
talk
together
he
had
been
for
the
most
part
careful
to
avoid
disparagement
of
the
religion
in
which
she
believed
so
that
it
was
only
some
chance
revelation
of
the
infidel
narrow
outlook
that
reminded
her
of
his
unbelief
yes
his
love
had
been
round
her
like
an
atmosphere
and
she
had
been
exquisitely
happy
while
that
unquestioning
affection
was
hers
on
her
part
there
had
been
neither
doubt
nor
fear
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
he
should
be
fond
of
her
and
she
of
him
affinity
had
made
them
brother
and
sister
and
then
they
had
been
together
in
sickness
and
in
peril
of
death
it
might
be
true
as
he
himself
had
affirmed
that
her
so
happy
arrival
had
saved
his
life
since
just
those
hours
between
the
departure
of
his
attendants
and
the
physician
evening
visit
may
have
been
the
crisis
of
his
disease
well
it
was
past
the
exquisite
bliss
the
unconscious
sin
the
confidence
the
danger
all
had
vanished
into
the
grave
of
irrecoverable
days
she
had
heard
nothing
from
denzil
since
she
left
london
nor
had
she
acknowledged
his
letter
her
silence
had
doubtless
angered
him
and
all
was
at
an
end
between
them
and
this
was
what
she
wished
hyacinth
and
her
children
were
at
chilton
whence
came
letters
of
complaining
against
the
dulness
of
the
country
where
his
lordship
hunted
four
times
a
week
and
spent
all
the
rest
of
his
time
in
his
library
appearing
only
at
our
stupid
heavy
meals
and
that
not
always
since
on
his
hunting
days
he
is
far
afield
when
i
have
to
sit
down
to
the
intolerable
dinner
and
make
a
pretence
of
eating
as
if
anybody
with
more
intellectuals
than
a
sheep
could
dine
or
as
if
appetite
came
by
staring
at
green
fields
you
remember
how
in
london
supper
was
the
only
meal
i
ever
cared
for
there
is
some
grace
in
a
repast
that
comes
after
conversation
and
music
or
the
theatre
or
a
round
of
visits
a
table
dazzling
with
lights
and
men
and
women
ready
to
amuse
and
be
amused
but
to
sit
down
in
broad
daylight
when
one
has
scarce
swallowed
one
morning
chocolate
and
face
a
sweltering
sirloin
or
open
a
smoking
veal
pie
indeed
dearest
our
whole
method
of
feeding
smacks
of
a
vulgar
brutishness
more
appropriate
to
a
company
of
topinambous
than
to
persons
of
quality
why
oh
why
must
these
reeking
hecatombs
load
our
tables
when
they
might
as
easily
be
kept
out
of
sight
upon
a
buffet
the
spectacle
of
huge
mountains
of
meat
the
steam
and
odour
of
rank
boiled
and
roast
under
one
very
nostrils
change
appetite
to
nausea
and
would
induce
a
delicate
person
to
rise
in
disgust
and
fly
from
the
mais
je
ne
fais
que
divaguer
and
almost
forget
what
it
was
i
was
so
earnest
to
tell
thee
when
i
began
my
letter
sir
denzil
warner
has
been
over
here
his
ostensible
motive
a
civil
inquiry
after
my
health
but
i
could
see
that
his
actual
purpose
was
to
hear
of
you
i
told
him
how
happily
your
simple
soul
has
accommodated
itself
to
an
almost
conventual
seclusion
and
a
very
inferior
style
of
living
whereupon
he
smiled
his
rapture
and
praised
you
to
the
skies
that
she
could
accommodate
herself
to
my
house
as
easily
he
said
should
have
every
indulgence
that
an
adoring
husband
could
yield
her
and
then
he
said
much
more
but
as
lovers
always
sing
the
same
repetitive
song
and
have
no
more
strings
to
their
lyre
than
the
ancients
had
before
mercury
expanded
it
i
confess
to
not
listening
over
carefully
and
will
leave
you
to
imagine
the
eloquence
of
a
manly
and
honourable
love
ah
sweetheart
you
do
wrong
to
reject
him
thou
hast
a
quiet
soothing
prettiness
of
thine
own
but
art
no
blazing
star
of
beauty
like
the
stewart
to
bring
a
king
to
thy
feet
he
would
have
married
her
if
poor
catherine
had
not
disappointed
him
by
her
recovery
and
to
take
a
duke
as
believe
me
love
it
were
wise
of
you
to
become
lady
warner
with
an
unmortgaged
estate
and
a
husband
who
in
these
republican
times
may
rise
to
distinction
he
is
your
only
earnest
admirer
and
a
love
so
steadfast
backed
by
a
fortune
so
respectable
should
not
be
discarded
lightly
over
all
these
latter
passages
in
her
sister
letter
angela
eye
ran
with
a
scornful
carelessness
her
womanly
pride
revolted
at
such
petty
schooling
that
she
should
be
bidden
to
accept
this
young
man
gratefully
because
he
was
her
only
suitor
no
one
else
had
ever
cared
for
her
pale
insignificance
she
looked
at
her
clouded
image
in
the
oblong
glass
that
hung
on
the
panel
above
her
secr√©taire
and
whose
reflection
made
any
idea
of
her
own
looks
rather
speculative
than
precise
it
showed
her
a
thoughtful
face
too
pale
for
beauty
yet
she
could
but
note
the
harmony
of
lines
which
recalled
that
venetian
type
familiar
to
her
eye
in
the
titians
and
tintorets
at
fareham
house
i
doubt
i
am
enough
for
any
one
to
be
satisfied
with
the
outward
semblance
who
valued
the
soul
within
she
thought
as
she
turned
from
the
glass
with
a
mournful
sigh
it
was
not
of
denzil
she
was
thinking
but
of
that
other
who
in
slow
contemplative
days
in
the
library
where
he
had
taught
her
what
books
she
ought
to
love
and
where
she
might
never
more
enter
must
naturally
sometimes
remember
her
and
cast
some
backward
thoughts
to
the
hours
they
had
spent
together
hyacinth
letter
of
matronly
counsel
was
but
a
week
old
when
sir
john
surprised
his
daughter
one
morning
as
they
sat
at
table
by
the
announcement
of
a
visitor
to
stay
in
the
house
you
will
order
the
west
room
to
be
got
ready
angela
and
bid
marjory
cook
serve
us
some
of
her
savourest
dishes
while
sir
denzil
stays
here
sir
denzil
yes
ma
mie
sir
denzil
ventregris
the
girl
stares
as
if
i
had
said
sir
bevis
of
southampton
or
sir
guy
of
warwick
i
knew
this
young
father
before
the
troubles
an
honest
man
though
he
took
the
wrong
side
he
paid
for
his
perversity
with
his
life
so
we
say
requiescat
the
young
man
is
a
fine
young
man
whom
i
would
fain
have
something
nearer
to
me
than
he
is
so
at
a
hint
from
your
sister
i
have
asked
him
to
bring
his
fishing
tackle
and
whip
our
streams
for
a
may
trout
or
two
he
may
catch
a
finer
fish
than
trout
perhaps
while
he
is
if
you
will
be
his
guide
through
the
meadows
father
how
could
you
ah
thou
art
a
sly
one
fair
mistress
who
was
it
told
me
there
was
no
one
one
dear
father
and
indeed
sir
i
was
thinking
of
the
convent
when
you
came
to
london
while
here
was
as
handsome
a
spark
as
one
would
meet
in
a
day
march
sighing
and
dying
for
you
father
i
do
protest
to
you
she
began
with
a
pale
distressed
look
that
vouched
for
her
earnestness
but
the
knight
had
his
face
in
the
tankard
and
set
it
down
only
to
pursue
his
own
train
of
thought
if
it
had
not
have
been
for
that
little
bird
at
chilton
you
might
have
hoodwinked
me
as
blind
as
ever
gerfalcon
was
hooded
well
the
young
man
will
be
here
before
evening
i
would
not
force
your
inclinations
but
it
is
the
dearest
desire
of
my
heart
to
see
you
happily
married
before
i
blow
out
the
candle
and
bid
my
last
good
night
and
a
man
of
honour
handsome
and
of
handsomest
fortune
is
not
to
be
slighted
angela
spirit
rose
against
this
recurrence
of
her
sister
sermon
if
sir
denzil
is
coming
to
this
house
as
my
suitor
i
will
go
to
louvain
without
an
hour
delay
that
i
can
help
she
said
resolutely
why
what
a
vixen
nay
dearest
there
is
no
need
for
that
angry
flush
the
young
man
is
too
courteous
to
plague
you
with
unwelcome
civilities
i
saw
him
in
london
at
the
tennis
court
and
was
friendly
to
him
for
his
father
memory
knowing
nothing
of
his
desire
to
be
my
he
is
a
fine
player
at
that
royal
game
and
a
fine
man
he
comes
here
this
evening
as
my
friend
and
if
you
please
to
treat
him
disdainfully
i
can
not
help
it
but
indeed
i
wonder
as
much
as
your
sister
why
you
should
not
reciprocate
this
gentleman
love
when
you
were
young
father
did
you
love
the
first
comer
only
because
she
was
handsome
and
civil
no
child
i
had
seen
many
handsome
women
before
i
met
your
mother
she
came
over
in
with
the
marquise
who
had
been
lady
of
honour
to
queen
marie
before
the
princess
henriette
married
our
king
and
queen
henriette
was
fond
of
her
and
invited
her
to
come
to
london
and
she
divided
her
life
between
the
two
countries
till
the
troubles
when
she
was
one
of
the
first
to
scamper
off
as
you
know
my
wife
was
little
more
than
a
child
when
i
saw
her
at
court
hiding
behind
her
mother
large
sleeves
i
had
seen
handsomer
women
but
she
was
the
first
whose
face
went
straight
to
my
heart
and
it
has
dwelt
there
ever
since
he
concluded
with
a
sudden
break
in
his
voice
then
you
can
comprehend
dear
sir
that
a
man
may
be
honourable
and
courteous
and
handsome
and
yet
not
win
a
woman
love
ah
it
is
not
the
man
it
is
love
that
should
win
sweetheart
love
is
worthy
of
love
when
that
is
the
true
coin
it
should
buy
its
reward
indeed
i
have
rarely
seen
it
otherwise
love
begets
love
louise
de
la
valli√®re
is
not
the
handsomest
woman
at
the
french
court
her
complexion
has
suffered
from
and
she
has
a
defective
gait
but
the
king
discovered
a
so
fond
and
romantic
attachment
to
his
person
a
love
ashamed
of
loving
the
very
poetry
of
affection
and
that
discovery
made
him
her
slave
the
court
beauties
sultanas
splendid
as
vashti
look
on
in
angry
wonder
louise
is
adored
because
she
began
by
adoring
mind
i
do
not
praise
or
excuse
her
for
is
a
mortal
sin
to
love
a
married
man
and
steal
him
from
his
wife
foolish
child
how
your
cheek
crimsons
i
do
wrong
to
shock
your
innocence
with
my
babble
of

mistress
denzil
arrived
at
sunset
on
horseback
with
a
mounted
servant
in
attendance
carrying
his
and
fishing
tackle
it
was
but
a
short
day
ride
from
oxford
fareham

have
brought
him
sometimes
within
a
few
miles
of
the
manor
moat
hyacinth
and
her
children
might
have
ridden
over
in
their
coach
and
indeed
she
had
promised
her
sister
a
visit
in
more
than
one
of
her
letters
but
there
had
been
always
something
to
postpone
the
expedition
company
at
home
or
bad
weather
or
a
fit
of
the
vapours
so
that
the
sisters
had
been
as
much
asunder
as
if
the
elder
had
been
in
yorkshire
or
northumberland
denzil
brought
news
of
the
household
at
chilton
lady
fareham
was
as
charming
as
ever
and
though
she
had
complained
very
often
of
bad
health
she
had
been
so
lively
and
active
whenever
the
whim
took
her
riding
with
hawk
and
hound
visiting
about
the
neighbourhood
driving
into
oxford
that
denzil
was
of
opinion
her
ailments
were
of
the
spirits
only
a
kind
of
rustic
malady
to
which
most
fine
ladies
were
subject
the
nostalgia
of
and
oil
lamps
henriette
she
now
insisted
upon
discarding
her
was
less
volatile
than
in
london
and
missed
her
aunt
sorely
and
quarrelled
with
mademoiselle
who
was
painfully
strict
upon
all
points
of
speech
and
manners
george
days
of
unalloyed
idleness
were
also
ended
for

roman
catholic

now
a
resident
in
the
house
as
the
little
boy
tutor
besides
teaching
the
rudiments
and
instructing
her
in
her
mother

denzil
told
them
even
of
the
guests
he
had
met
at
the
abbey
but
of
the
master
of
the
house
his
lips
spoke
not

questioned
him

that
same
air
of
not
belonging
to
the
family
which
i
remarked
of
him
in
london
his
lordship
has
ever
an
air
of
being
aloof
from
everybody
denzil
answered
gravely
he
is
solitary
even
in
his
sports
and
his
indoor
life
is
mostly
buried
in
a
book
ah
those
books
they
will
be
the
ruin
of
nations
as
books
multiply
great
actions
will
grow
less
life
golden
hours
will
be
wasted
in
dreaming
over
the
fancies
of
dead
men
and
the
world
will
be
of
brooding
philosophers
like
descartes
or
pamphleteers
like
your
friend
mr
milton
nay
sir
the
world
is
richer
for
such
a
man
as
john
milton
who
has
composed
the
grandest
poem
in
our
language
an
epic
on
a
scale
and
subject
as
sublime
as
the
divine
comedy
of
dante
i
never
saw
dante
comedy
acted
and
confess
myself
ignorant
of
its
merits
comedy
sir
with
dante
is
but
a
name
the
italian
poem
is
an
epic
and
not
a
play
milton
poem
will
be
given
to
the
world
shortly
though
alas
he
will
reap
little
substantial
reward
for
the
intellectual
labour
of
years
poetry
is
not
a
marketable
commodity
in
england
save
when
it
flatters
a
royal
patron
or
takes
the
vulgarer
form
of
a
but
this
poem
of
milton
has
been
the
solace
of
his
darkened
life
you
have
heard
perhaps
of
his
blindness
yes
he
had
to
forego
his
office
as
latin
secretary
to
that
villain
to
my
mind
the
decay
of
sight
was
a
judgment
upon
him
for
having
written
against
his
murdered
king
even
to
the
denial
of
his
majesty
own
account
of
his
sufferings
but
i
confess
that
even
if
the
man
had
been
a
loyal
subject
i
have
little
admiration
for
that
class
scribblers
and
pamphleteers
brooders
over
books
crouchers
in
the
who
have
never
trailed
a
pike
or
slept
under
the
open
sky
and
seeing
this
vast
increase
of
and
the
arising
of
such
men
as
hobbes
to
question
our
religion
and
milton
to
assail
monarchy
i
can
but
believe
those
who
say
that
this
old
england
has
taken
the
downward
bent
that
as
we
are
dwindling
in
stature
so
we
are
decaying
in
courage
and
capacity
for
action
denzil
listened
respectfully
to
the
old
man
disquisitions
over
his
morning
drink
while
reuben
stood
at
the
sideboard
carving
a
ham
or
a
round
of
powdered
beef
and
while
angela
sipped
her
chocolate
out
of
the
porcelain
cup
which
hyacinth
had
bought
for
her
at
the
middle
exchange
where
curiosities
from
china
and
the
last
inventions
from
paris
were
always
to
be
had
before
they
were
seen
anywhere
else
nothing
could
be
more
reverential
than
the
young
man
bearing
to
his
host
while
his
quiet
friendliness
set
angela
at
her
ease
and
made
her
think
that
he
had
abandoned
his
suit
and
henceforward
aspired
only
to
such
a
tranquil
friendship
as
they
had
enjoyed
at
chilton
before
any
word
of
love
had
been
spoken
apart
from
the
question
of
love
and
marriage
his
presence
was
in
no
manner
displeasing
to
her
indeed
the
long
days
in
that
sequestered
valley
lost
something
of
their
grey
monotony
now
that
she
had
a
companion
in
all
her
intellectual
occupations
fondly
as
she
loved
her
father
she
had
not
been
able
to
hide
from
herself
the
narrowness
of
his
education
and
the
blind
prejudice
which
governed
his
ideas
upon
almost
every
subject
from
politics
to
natural
history
of
the
books
which
make
the
greater
part
of
a
solitary
life
she
could
never
talk
to
him
and
it
was
here
that
she
had
so
sorely
missed
the
counsellor
and
friend
who
had
taught
her
to
love
and
to
comprehend
the
great
poets
of
the
past
homer
and
virgil
dante
and
tasso
and
the
deep
melancholy
humour
of
cervantes
and
most
of
all
the
inexhaustible
riches
of
the
elizabethans
denzil
was
of
a
temper
as
thoughtful
but
his
studies
had
taken
a
different
direction
he
was
not
even
by
taste
or
apprehension
a
poet
had
he
been
called
upon
to
criticise
his
tutor
compositions
he
might
like
johnson
have
objected
to
the
metaphoric
turns
of
lycidas
and
have
missed
the
melody
of
lines
as
musical
as
the
nightingale
in
that
great
poem
of
which
he
had
been
privileged
to
transcribe
many
of
the
finest
passages
from
the
lips
of
the
poet
he
admired
rather
the
heroic
patience
of
the
blind
author
than
the
splendour
of
the
verse
he
was
more
impressed
by
the
schoolmaster
learning
than
by
that
genius
which
lifted
that
one
englishman
above
every
other
of
his
age
and
country
no
he
was
eminently
prosaic
had
sucked
prose
and
from
his
mother
breast
but
he
was
not
the
less
an
agreeable
companion
for
a
girl
upon
whose
youth
an
unnatural
solitude
had
begun
to
weigh
heavily
all
that
one
mind
can
impart
to
another
of
a
widely
different
fibre
denzil
had
learnt
from
milton
in
that
most
impressionable
period
of
boyhood
which
he
had
spent
in
the
small
house
in
holborn
whose
back
rooms
looked
out
over
the
verdant
spaces
of
lincoln
inn
fields
where
lord
palace
had
not
yet
begun
to
rise
from
its
foundations
and
where
the
singing
birds
had
not
been
scared
away
by
the
growth
of
the
town
a
theatre
now
stood
where
the
boy
and
a
had
played
trap
and
ball
and
the
stately
houses
of
queen
street
hard
by
were
alive
with
rank
and
fashion
in
addition
to
the
classical
curriculum
which
milton
had
taught
with
the
solemn
earnestness
of
one
in
whom
learning
is
a
religion
denzil
had
acquired
a
store
of
miscellaneous
knowledge
from
the
great
republican
and
most
interesting
among
these
casual
instructions
had
been
the
close
acquaintance
with
nature
gained
in
the
course
of
many
a
rustic
ramble
in
the
country
lanes
beyond
gray
inn
or
sauntering
eastward
along
the
banks
of
the
limpid
lee
or
in
the
undulating
meadows
beside
sir
hugh
river
mixed
with
plain
facts
about
plant
or
flower
animal
or
insect
milton
memory
was
stored
with
the
quaint
absurdities
of
the
hermetic
philosophy
that
curious
mixture
of
theories
and
old
superstitions
the
experience
of
the
peasant
transmuted
by
the
imagination
of
the
adept
sound
and
practical
as
the
poet
had
ever
shown
himself
save
where
passion
got
the
upper
hand
of
common
sense
as
in
his
advocacy
of
divorce
he
was
yet
not
entirely
free
from
a
leaning
to
baconian
superstitions
and
may
with
gesner
have
believed
that
the
pickerel
weed
could
engender
pike
and
that
frogs
could
turn
to
slime
in
winter
and
become
frogs
again
in
spring
whatever
rags
of
fatuity
may
have
lingered
in
that
strong
brain
he
had
been
not
the
less
a
delightful
teacher
and
had
imparted
an
ardent
love
of
nature
to
his
little
family
of
pupils
in
that
peripatetic
school
between
hawthorn
hedges
or
in
the
open
fields
by
the
lee
and
now
in
quiet
rambles
with
angela
in
the
midst
of
a
landscape
transfigured
by
that
vernal
beauty
which
begins
with
the
waning
of
april
and
is
past
and
vanished
before
the
end
of
may
denzil
loved
to
expound
the
wonders
of
the
infinitesimal
the
insect
life
that
sparkled
and
hummed
in
the
balmy
air
or
flashed
like
living
light
among
the
dewy
grasses
the
life
of
plant
and
flower
which
seemed
almost
as
personal
and
conscious
a
form
of
existence
since
it
was
difficult
to
believe
there
was
no
sense
of
struggle
or
of
joy
in
those
rapid
growths
which
shot
out
from
a
tangle
of
dark
undergrowth
upward
to
the
sunlight
no
fondness
in
the
wild
vines
that
clung
so
close
to
some
patriarchal
trunk
covering
decay
with
the
beautiful
exuberance
of
youth
denzil
taught
her
to
realise
the
wonders
of
creation
most
wonderful
when
most
minute
for
beyond
the
picturesque
and
lovely
in
nature
he
showed
her
those
marvels
of
order
and
law
and
adaptation
which
speak
to
the
naturalist
with
a
stronger
language
than
beauty
there
was
a
tranquil
pleasure
in
these
rustic
walks
which
beguiled
her
into
forgetfulness
that
this
man
had
ever
sought
to
be
more
to
her
than
he
was
now
a
respectful
unobtrusive
friend
of
london
and
the
tumultuous
life
going
on
there
he
had
scarcely
spoken
save
to
tell
her
that
he
meant
to
stand
for
henley
at
the
next
parliament
nor
had
he
alluded
to
the
past
at
chilton
nor
ever
of
his
own
accord
had
he
spoken
lord
fareham
name
indeed
that
name
was
studiously
avoided
by
them
both
and
if
denzil
had
never
before
suspected
angela
of
an
unhappy
preference
for
one
whom
she
could
not
love
without
sin
he
might
have
had
some
cause
for
such
suspicion
in
the
eagerness
with
which
she
changed
the
drift
of
the
conversation
whenever
it
approached
that
forbidden
subject
from
his
puritanical
bringing
up
the
theory
of
and
deprivation
ever
kept
before
him
denzil
had
assuredly
learnt
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
and
throughout
all
that
smiling
month
of
may
while
he
whipped
the
capricious
streams
that
wound
about
the
valley
with
angela
for
the
willing
companion
of
his
saunterings
from
pool
to
pool
he
never
once
alarmed
her
by
any
hint
of
a
warmer
feeling
than
friendship
indeed
he
thought
of
himself
sometimes
as
one
who
lived
in
an
enchanted
world
where
to
utter
a
certain
fatal
word
would
be
to
break
the
spell
and
whatever
momentary
impulse
or
passionate
longing
engendered
by
a
look
a
smile
the
light
touch
of
a
hand
the
mere
sense
of
proximity
might
move
him
to
speak
of
his
love
he
had
sufficient
to
keep
the
fatal
words
unspoken
he
meant
to
wait
till
the
last
hour
of
his
visit
only
when
separation
was
imminent
would
he
plead
his
cause
again
thus
at
the
worst
he
would
have
lost
no
happy
hours
of
her
company
and
in
the
mean
time
since
she
was
always
kind
and
seemed
to
grow
daily
more
familiar
and
at
ease
in
his
society
he
dared
hope
that
affection
for
him
and
forgetfulness
of
that
other
were
growing
side
by
side
in
her
mind
in
this
companionship
angela
learnt
many
of
the
secrets
and
subtleties
of
the
angler
craft
as
acquired
by
her
teacher
personal
experience
or
expounded
in
that
delightful
book
then
less
than
twenty
years
old
which
has
ever
been
the
angler
gospel
often
after
following
the
meandering
water
till
a
gentle
weariness
invited
them
to
rest
angela
and
denzil
seated
themselves
on
a
sheltered
bank
and
read
their
izaak
walton
together
both
out
of
the
same
volume
he
pleased
to
point
out
his
favourite
passages
and
to
watch
her
smile
as
she
read
before
may
was
ended
she
knew
old
izaak
almost
as
well
as
denzil
and
had
learnt
to
throw
a
fly
and
to
choose
the
likeliest
spot
and
the
happiest
hour
of
the
day
for
a
good
trout
had
learnt
to
watch
the
clouds
and
with
an
angler
keen
interest
and
had
amused
herself
with
the
manufacture
of
an
artificial
minnow
upon
walton
recipe
devoting
careful
labour
and
all
the
resources
of
her
embroidery
basket
silks
and
silver
thread
to
perfecting
the
delicate
model
which
when
completed
she
presented
smilingly
to
denzil
who
was
strangely
moved
by
so
childish
a
toy
and
had
some
difficulty
in
suppressing
his
emotion
as
he
held
the
glistening
silken
fish
in
his
hands
and
thought
how
her
tapering
fingers
had
caressed
it
and
how
much
of
her
very
self
seemed
as
he
watched
her
to
have
been
enwrought
with
the
fabric
so
poor
so
trivial
a
thing
but
her
first
gift
if
she
had
tossed
him
a
flower
plucked
that
moment
he
would
have
treasured
it
all
his
life
but
this
which
had
cost
her
so
much
careful
work
was
far
more
than
any
casual
blossom
something
of
the
magnetism
of
her
mind
had
passed
into
the
silver
thread
drawn
so
daintily
through
her
rosy
fingers
something
of
the
soft
light
in
her
eyes
had
mixed
with
the
blended
colours
of
the
silk
foolish
fancies
these
but
in
the
gravest
man
love
there
is
a
vein
of
folly
sometimes
they
rode
with
sir
john
and
in
this
way
explored
the
neighbourhood
which
was
rich
in
historical
associations
some
of
the
remote
past
as
when
king
john
kept
christmas
at
brill
but
chiefly
of
those
troubled
times
through
which
sir
john
kirkland
had
lived
an
active
participator
in
that
deadly
drama
he
showed
them
the
site
of
the
garrison
at
brill
and
trod
every
foot
of
the
earthworks
to
demonstrate
how
the
hill
had
been
fortified
he
had
commanded
in
the
defence
against
hampden
and
his
greencoats
that
regiment
of
foot
raised
in
his
pastoral
shire
whose
standard
bore
on
one
side
the
watchword
of
the
parliament
god
with
us
and
on
the
other
hampden
own
device
nulla
was
a
legend
to
frighten
some
of
us
who
had
no
latin
said
sir
john
but
we
put
his
bumpkin
greencoats
to
the
rout
and
trampled
that
insolent
flag
in
the
mire
all
was
peaceful
now
in
the
hamlet
on
the
hill
women
and
children
were
sitting
upon
sunny
doorsteps
with
their
pillows
on
their
knees
and
their
bobbins
moving
quickly
in
dexterous
fingers
busy
at
the
which
had
been
established
in
buckinghamshire
more
than
a
century
before
by
catherine
of
aragon
whose
dowry
was
derived
from
the
revenues
of
steeple
claydon
the
curate
had
returned
to
the
grey
old
church
and
rural
life
pursued
its
slumbrous
course
scarce
ruffled
by
rumours
of
maritime
war
or
plague
or
fire
they
rode
to
thame
a
stage
on
the
journey
to
oxford
angela
thought
as
she
noted
the
figures
on
a
milestone
and
at
a
flash
her
memory
recalled
that
scene
in
the
gardens
by
the
river
when
fareham
had
spoken
for
the
first
time
of
his
inner
life
and
she
had
seen
the
man
behind
the
mask
she
thought
of
her
sister
so
fair
so
sweet
charming
in
her
capriciousness
even
yet
not
the
woman
to
fill
that
unquiet
heart
or
satisfy
that
sombre
and
earnest
nature
it
was
not
by
many
words
that
fareham
had
revealed
himself
her
knowledge
of
his
character
and
feelings
went
deeper
than
the
knowledge
that
words
can
impart
it
came
from
that
constant
unconscious
study
which
a
romantic
girl
devotes
to
the
character
of
the
man
who
first
awakens
her
interest
angela
was
grave
and
silent
throughout
the
drive
to
thame
and
the
return
home
riding
for
the
most
part
in
the
rear
of
the
two
men
leaving
denzil
to
devote
all
his
attention
to
sir
john
who
was
somewhat
loquacious
that
afternoon
stimulated
by
the
many
memories
of
the
troubled
time
which
the
road
awakened
denzil
listened
respectfully
and
went
never
astray
in
his
answers
but
he
looked
back
very
often
to
the
solitary
rider
who
kept
at
some
distance
to
avoid
the
dust
sometimes
in
the
early
morning
they
all
went
with
the
otter
hounds
the
knight
on
horseback
denzil
and
angela
on
foot
and
spent
two
or
three
very
active
hours
before
breakfast
in
rousing
the
otter
from
his
holt
and
following
every
flash
of
his
head
upon
the
stream
with
that
briskness
and
active
enjoyment
which
seem
a
part
of
the
clear
morning
atmosphere
the
inspiring
breath
of
dewy
fields
and
flowers
unfaded
by
the
sun
all
that
there
was
of
girlishness
in
angela
spirits
was
awakened
by
those
merry
morning
scampers
by
the
margin
of
the
stream
which
had
often
to
be
forded
by
the
runners
with
but
little
heed
of
wet
feet
or
splashed
petticoat
the
parson
and
his
daughters
from
the
village
of
st
nicholas
joined
in
the
sport
and
were
invited
to
the
morning
drink
and
substantial
breakfast
afterwards
where
the
young
ladies
were
lost
in
admiration
of
silver
and
porcelain
cups
while
their
clerical
father
owned
to
a
distaste
for
all
morning
drinks
except
such
as
owed
their
flavour
and
strength
to
malt
and
hops
if
you
had
lived
among
green
fields
and
damp
marshes
as
long
as
i
have
miss
you
would
know
what
poor
stuff
your
chocolate
is
to
fortify
a
bones
against
ague
and
rheumatism
i
am
told
the
spaniards
brought
it
from
mexico
where
the
natives
eat
nothing
else
from
which
comes
the
copper
colour
of
their
skins
denzi
visit
lasted
over
a
month
during
which
time
he
rode
into
oxfordshire
twice
to
see
lady
warner
stopping
a
night
each
time
lest
that
worthy
person
should
fancy
herself
neglected
sir
john
derived
the
utmost
pleasure
from
the
young
man
company
who
bore
himself
towards
his
host
with
a
respectful
courtesy
that
had
gone
out
of
fashion
after
the
murder
of
the
king
and
was
rarely
met
with
in
an
age
when
elderly
men
were
generally
spoken
of
as
old
puts
and
considered
proper
subjects
for
bubbling
to
denzil
the
old
campaigner
opened
his
heart
more
freely
than
he
had
ever
done
to
any
one
except
a
brother
in
arms
and
although
he
was
resolute
in
upholding
the
cause
of
monarchy
against
republicanism
he
owned
to
the
natural
disappointment
which
he
had
felt
at
the
king
neglect
of
old
friends
and
reluctantly
admitted
that
charles
sauntering
along
pall
mall
with
ruin
at
his
heels
and
the
wickedest
men
and
women
in
england
for
his
chosen
companions
was
not
a
monarch
to
maintain
and
strengthen
the
public
idea
of
the
divinity
that
doth
hedge
a
king
of
all
the
lessons
danger
and
adversity
can
teach
he
has
learnt
but
one
said
sir
john
with
a
regretful
sigh
he
has
learnt
the
horatian
philosophy
to
snatch
the
pleasures
of
the
day
and
care
nothing
what
may
happen
on
the
morrow
i
do
not
wonder
that
predictions
of
a
sudden
end
to
this
globe
of
ours
should
have
been
bruited
about
of
late
for
if
lust
and
profaneness
could
draw
down
fire
from
heaven
london
would
be
in
as
perilous
a
case
as
gomorrah
but
i
doubt
such
particular
judgments
belonged
but
to
the
infancy
of
this
world
when
men
believed
in
a
personal
god
interested
in
all
their
concerns
watchful
to
bless
or
to
punish
we
have
now
but
the
god
of
spinoza
a
god
who
is
in
all
things
and
everywhere
about
us
of
whom
this
creation
in
which
we
move
is
but
the
garment
a
universal
essence
which
should
govern
and
inform
all
we
are
and
all
we
do
but
not
the
judge
and
father
of
his
people
to
be
reached
by
prayer
and
touched
by
pity
ah
sir
our
life
here
and
hereafter
is
encompassed
with
mystery
to
think
is
to
be
lost
on
the
trackless
ocean
of
doubt
the
papists
have
the
easiest
creed
for
they
believe
that
which
they
are
taught
and
take
the
mysteries
of
the
unseen
world
at
second
hand
from
their
priests
a
year
ago
had
i
been
happy
enough
to
win
your
daughter
i
should
have
tried
my
hardest
to
wean
her
from
rome
but
i
have
lived
and
thought
since
then
and
i
have
come
to
see
that
calvinism
is
a
religion
of
despair
and
that
the
doctrine
of
predestination
involves
contradictions
as
difficult
to
swallow
as
any
fable
of
the
roman
church
it
is
well
that
you
should
be
prepared
to
let
her
keep
her
religion
for
i
doubt
she
has
a
stubborn
affection
for
the
creed
she
learnt
in
her
childhood
indeed
it
was
but
the
other
day
she
talked
of
the
cloister
and
i
fear
she
has
all
the
disposition
to
that
religious
prison
in
which
her
great
aunt
lived
contentedly
for
the
space
of
a
long
lifetime
but
it
is
for
you
denzil
to
cure
her
of
that
fancy
and
to
spare
me
the
pain
of
seeing
my
child
under
the
black
veil
indeed
sir
if
a
love
as
earnest
as
man
ever
experienced
yes
denzil
i
know
you
love
her
and
i
love
you
almost
as
if
you
were
my
very
son
in
the
years
that
went
by
after
hyacinth
was
born
before
the
beginning
of
trouble
i
used
to
long
for
a
son
and
i
am
afraid
i
did
sometimes
distress
my
dear
wife
by
dwelling
too
persistently
upon
disappointed
hopes
and
then
came
chaos
england
in
arms
a
rebellious
people
a
king
put
upon
his
defence
and
i
had
leisure
to
think
of
none
but
my
royal
master
and
in
the
thick
of
the
strife
my
poor
lamb
was
born
to
me
the
bringer
of
my
life
great
sorrow
and
there
was
no
more
thought
of
sons
so
you
see
friend
the
place
in
my
heart
and
home
has
waited
empty
for
you
win
but
yonder
shy
dove
to
consent
and
we
shall
be
of
one
family
and
of
one
mind
and
i
as
happy
as
any
campaigner
in
england
can
be
content
to
creep
to
the
grave
in
obscurity
forgotten
by
the
prince
whose
father
it
is
my
dear
memory
to
have
served
you
loved
your
king
sir
i
take
it
with
a
personal
affection
ah
denzil
we
all
loved
him
even
the
common
people
led
as
they
were
by
hectoring
preachers
of
sedition
of
no
more
truth
or
honesty
than
the
mountebanks
that
ply
their
knavish
trade
round
henry
statue
on
the
pont
neuf
even
they
the
very
rabble
had
their
hours
of
loyalty
i
rode
with
his
majesty
from
royston
to
hatfield
in
when
the
people
filled
the
midsummer
air
with
his
name
from
hearts
melting
with
love
and
pity
they
strewed
the
ways
with
boughs
and
strewed
the
boughs
with
roses
so
great
honour
has
been
seldom
shown
to
a
royal
captive
i
take
it
that
the
lower
class
are
no
politicians
and
loved
their
king
for
his
private
virtues
never
was
monarch
worthier
to
be
so
esteemed
he
was
a
man
of
deep
affections
and
it
was
perhaps
his
most
fatal
quality
where
he
loved
to
love
too
much
i
have
no
grudge
against
that
beautiful
and
most
accomplished
woman
he
so
worshipped
and
who
was
ever
gracious
to
me
but
i
can
not
doubt
that
henrietta
maria
was
his
evil
star
she
had
the
fire
and
daring
of
her
father
but
none
of
his
care
and
affection
for
the
people
the
daughter
of
the
most
beloved
of
kings
had
the
instincts
of
a
tyrant
and
was
ever
urging
her
too
pliant
husband
to
unpopular
measures
she
wanted
to
set
that
little
jewelled
shoe
of
hers
on
the
neck
of
rebellion
when
she
should
have
held
out
her
soft
white
hand
to
make
friends
of
her
foes
her
beauty
and
her
grace
might
have
done
much
had
she
inherited
with
the
pride
of
the
medici
something
of
their
finesse
and
suavity
but
he
loved
her
denzil
forgave
all
her
follies
her
lavish
spending
and
wasteful
splendour
wife
is
a
bad
housekeeper
i
heard
him
say
once
when
she
was
hanging
upon
his
chair
as
he
sat
at
the
end
of
the
council
table
the
palace
accounts
were
on
the
table
three
thousand
pounds
for
a
masque
extravagance
only
surpassed
by
nicholas
fouquet
twenty
years
afterwards
when
he
was
squandering
the
public
money
wife
is
a
bad
housekeeper
his
majesty
said
gently
and
then
he
drew
down
the
little
french
museau
with
a
caressing
hand
and
kissed
her
in
the
presence
of
those
greybeards
his
son
is
strangely
unlike
him
in
domestic
matters
his
son
has
the
manners
of
a
frenchman
and
the
morals
of
a
turk
he
is
a
despot
to
his
wife
and
a
slave
to
his
mistress
there
never
was
greater
cruelty
to
a
woman
than
his
majesty
treatment
of
catherine
while
she
was
still
but
a
stranger
in
the
land
and
when
he
forced
his
notorious
paramour
upon
her
as
her
lady
of
honour
of
honour
quotha
there
was
sorry
store
of
honour
in
his
conduct
he
had
need
feel
the
sting
of
remorse
day
when
the
poor
lady
was
thought
to
be
on
her
so
gentle
so
affectionate
so
broken
to
the
of
apologising
for
having
lived
to
trouble
him
ned
hyde
has
given
me
the
whole
story
of
that
poor
lady
subjugation
for
he
was
behind
the
scenes
and
in
their
secrets
poor
soul
blood
rushed
from
her
ears
and
nostrils
when
that
shameless
woman
was
brought
to
her
and
she
was
carried
swooning
to
her
chamber
and
then
she
was
sullen
and
the
king
threatened
her
and
sent
away
all
her
portuguese
save
one
ancient
waiting
woman
i
grant
you
they
were
ugly
devils
fit
to
set
in
a
field
to
frighten
crows
but
catherine
loved
them
royal
treatment
for
a
christian
queen
from
a
christian
king
could
the
sophy
do
worse
and
presently
the
poor
lady
yielded
as
most
women
will
for
at
heart
they
are
slavish
and
love
to
be
beaten
and
after
holding
herself
aloof
for
a
long
time
a
sad
silent
neglected
figure
where
all
the
rest
were
loud
and
merry
she
made
friends
with
the
lady
and
even
seemed
to
fawn
upon
her
and
now
i
dare
swear
the
two
women
mingle
their
tears
when
charles
is
unfaithful
to
both
or
catherine
weeps
while
barbara
curses
that
would
be
more
in
character
fire
and
not
water
is
her
ladyship
element
ah
denzil
is
a
curious
change
and
to
have
lived
to
see
buckingham
murdered
and
stafford
sacrificed
and
the
rebellion
and
the
commonwealth
and
the
restoration
and
the
plague
and
the
fire
and
to
have
skirmished
in
the
battles
of
parliaments
and
princes
side
the
channel
and
seen
the
tail
of
the
thirty
years
war
towns
ruined
villages
laid
waste
where
tilly
passed
in
blood
and
fire
is
to
have
lived
through
as
wild
a
variety
of
fortunes
as
ever
madman
invented
in
a
dream
denzil
lingered
at
the
manor
urged
again
and
again
by
his
host
to
stay
over
the
day
fixed
for
departure
and
so
lengthening
his
visit
with
a
most
willing
submission
till
late
in
june
when
the
silence
of
the
nightingales
made
sleep
more
possible
and
the
sunset
was
so
late
and
the
sunrise
so
early
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
such
thing
as
night
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
plead
for
a
hearing
in
the
hour
of
farewell
and
it
may
have
been
as
much
from
apprehension
of
that
fateful
hour
as
even
from
the
delight
of
being
in
his
mistress
company
that
he
acceded
with
alacrity
when
sir
john
desired
him
to
stay
but
an
end
must
come
at
last
to
all
hesitations
and
a
familiar
verse
repeated
itself
in
his
brain
with
the
persistent
iteration
of
cathedral
chimes
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
desert
is
small
who
fears
to
put
it
to
the
touch
and
win
or
lose
it
all
sir
john
pushed
him
towards
his
fate
with
affectionate
urgency
never
be
dastardised
by
a
girl
refusal

the
knight
warm
with
his

draught
on
that
last
day

journey

packed

she
would
scarce

and

in
your
company
all
these
weeks
take

remember
that
though
i
am
no
tyrannical
father
to
drag
an
unwilling
bride

i
have
all
a

and
will
not

the
capricious
humours

what
can

better
than
a
handsome
and
virtuous
husband
angela
was
in
the
garden
when
denzil
went
to
take
leave
of
her
she
was
walking
up
and
down
beside
a
long
border
of
june
flowers
screened
from
rough
winds
by
those
thick
walls
of
yew
which
gave
such
a
comfortable
sheltered
feeling
to
the
manor
gardens
while
in
front
of
flowers
and
turf
there
sparkled
the
waters
of
a
long
pond
or
stew
stocked
with
tench
and
carp
some
among
them
as
ancient
and
as
greedy
as
the
scaly
monsters
of
fontainebleau
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
dark
green
water
and
the
gaudy
and
angela
favourite
spaniel
was
running
about
the
grass
barking
his
loudest
chasing
bird
or
butterfly
with
impotent
fury
since
he
never
caught
anything
at
sight
of
denzil
he
tore
across
the
greensward
his
silky
ears
flying
and
barked
at
him
as
if
the
young
man
appearance
in
that
garden
were
an
insufferable
impertinence
but
on
being
taken
up
in
one
strong
hand
changed
his
opinion
and
slobbered
the
face
of
the
foe
in
an
ecstasy
of
affection
soho
ganymede
thou
knowest
i
bear
thee
a
good
heart
plaything
and
mere
pretence
of
a
dog
as
thou
art
said
denzil
depositing
their
little
bundle
of
flossiness
at
angela
feet
he
might
have
carried
and
nursed
his
mistress
favourite
with
pleasure
during
any
casual
sauntering
and
random
talk
but
a
man
could
hardly
ask
to
have
his
fate
decided
for
good
or
ill
with
a
toy
spaniel
in
his
arms
my
horse
is
at
the
door
angela
and
i
am
come
to
bid
you
he
said
in
a
grave
voice
the
words
were
of
the
simplest
but
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
told
her
all
was
not
said
she
paled
at
the
thought
of
an
approaching
conflict
for
she
knew
her
father
was
against
her
and
that
there
must
be
hard
fighting
they
walked
the
length
of
flower
border
and
lawn
in
silence
and
then
when
they
were
furthest
from
the
house
and
from
the
hazard
of
eyes
looking
out
of
windows
he
stopped
suddenly
and
took
her
unresisting
hand
which
lay
cold
in
his
dearest
i
have
kept
silence
through
all
those
blessed
days
in
which
you
and
i
have
been
together
but
i
have
not
left
off
loving
you
or
hoping
for
you
things
have
changed
since
i
spoke
to
you
in
london
last
winter
i
have
a
powerful
advocate
now
whose
pleading
ought
to
prevail
with
you
a
father
whose
anxious
affection
urges
what
my
passionate
love
so
ardently
desires
indeed
dear
heart
if
you
will
be
kind
you
can
make
a
father
and
lover
happy
with
one
breath
you
have
but
to
say
to
the
prayer
you
know
of
alas
denzil
i
can
not
i
am
your
true
and
faithful
friend
if
you
were
sick
and
alone
as
his
lordship
was
i
would
go
to
you
and
nurse
you
as
your
friend
and
sister
if
you
were
poor
and
i
were
rich
i
would
divide
my
fortune
with
you
i
shall
always
think
of
you
with
affection
always
take
pleasure
in
your
society
if
you
will
let
me
but
it
must
be
as
your
sister
you
have
no
sister
denzil
i
no
brother
why
can
not
we
be
to
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
only
because
from
the
hour
when
your
beauty
and
sweetness
began
to
grow
into
my
mind
i
have
been
your
lover
and
nothing
else
your
adoring
lover
i
can
not
change
my
fervent
hope
for
the
poor
name
of
friend
i
can
never
again
dare
be
to
you
what
i
have
been
in
this
happy
season
last
past
unless
you
will
let
me
be
more
than
i
have
been
alas
only
that
one
word
with
a
sorrowful
shake
of
the
graceful
head
covered
with
feathery
ringlets
in
the
dainty
fashion
of
that
day
so
becoming
in
youth
so
inappropriate
to
advancing
years
when
the
rich
profusion
of
curls
came
straight
from
chedreux
or
some
of
his
imitators
and
baldness
was
hidden
by
the
spoils
of
the
dead
alas
no
need
for
more
than
that
sad
dissyllable
then
i
am
no
nearer
winning
this
dear
hand
than
i
was
at
fareham
house
he
said
heartbrokenly
for
he
had
built
high
hopes
upon
her
kindness
and
willing
companionship
in
that
arcadian
valley
i
told
you
then
that
i
should
never
marry
i
have
not
changed
my
mind
i
never
can
change
i
am
to
be
henriette
spinster
aunt
and
fareham
spinster
sister
said
denzil
i
understand
we
are
neither
of
us
cured
of
our
malady
it
is
my
disease
to
love
you
in
spite
of
your
disdain
it
is
your
disease
to
love
where
you
should
not
farewell
he
was
gone
before
she
could
reply
the
livid
anger
of
his
face
the
deep
resentment
in
his
voice
haunted
her
memory
and
made
life
almost
intolerable
my
sin
has
found
me
out
she
said
to
herself
as
she
paced
the
garden
with
the
rapid
steps
that
indicate
a
distempered
spirit
what
right
has
he
to
pry
into
the
depths
of
my
mind
and
ferret
out
all
that
there
is
of
evil
in
my
nature
well
he
goes
the
surest
way
to
make
me
hate
him
if
ever
he
comes
here
again
i
will
run
away
and
hide
from
all
who
know
me
i
would
rather
be
a
and
rise
at
daybreak
to
work
in
the
fields
than
endure
his
insolence
she
had
to
bear
worse
pain
before
denzil
had
ridden
far
upon
his
journey
for
her
father
came
to
the
garden
to
seek
her
eager
to
know
the
result
of
his
wooing
well
sweetheart
he
began
taking
her
to
his
bosom
and
kissing
her
do
i
salute
the
future
lady
warner
no
sir
i
am
too
well
content
with
the
name
i
inherit
to
desire
any
other
that
is
gracefully
said
ch√©rie
but
i
want
to
see
my
ewe
lamb
happily
wedded
has
thy
sweetheart
stolen
away
without
finding
courage
to
ask
the
question
that
has
been
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
for
the
last
six
weeks
he
has
been
both
importunate
and
impertinent
sir
and
he
has
had
his
answer
i
hope
i
may
never
see
him
again
what
you
have
refused
him
you
must
be
mad
no
sir
sober
and
sane
enough
to
know
when
i
am
happy
i
told
you
before
this
gentleman
came
here
that
i
did
not
mean
to
marry
surely
i
am
not
so
unloving
a
daughter
that
i
must
be
driven
to
take
a
husband
because
my
father
will
not
have
me
angela
it
is
for
your
own
safety
and
welfare
i
would
see
you
married
what
have
you
to
succeed
to
when
i
am
gone
an
impoverished
estate
in
a
country
that
has
seen
such
rough
changes
within
a
score
of
years
that
one
dare
scarcely
calculate
upon
a
prolonged
time
of
safety
even
in
this
sequestered
valley
god
only
knows
when
may
tear
up
our
fields
and
bullets
whistle
through
the
copses
this
monarchy
restored
with
such
a
clamorous
approval
may
endure
no
longer
than
the
commonwealth
which
was
thought
to
be
lasting
his
majesty
trivial
life
and
gross
extravagance
have
disgusted
and
alarmed
some
who
loved
him
dearly
and
have
set
the
common
people
questioning
whether
the
rough
rule
of
the
protector
were
not
better
than
the
ascendency
of
shameless
women
and
dissolute
men
the
pageantry
of
whitehall
may
vanish
like
a
parchment
scroll
in
a
furnace
and
charles
who
has
tasted
the
sours
of
exile
may
be
again
a
wanderer
dependent
on
the
casual
munificence
of
foreign
states
and
in
such
an
evil
hour
continued
the
knight
his
mind
straying
from
the
contemplation
of
his
daughter
future
to
the
memory
of
his
own
wrongs
charles
stuart
may
remember
the
old
puts
who
fought
and
suffered
for
his
father
and
how
scurvy
a
recompense
they
had
for
their
services
he
reverted
to
denzil
offer
after
a
brief
silence
angela
walking
dutifully
by
his
side
prepared
to
suffer
any
harshness
upon
his
part
without
complaining
i
love
the
young
man
and
he
would
be
to
me
as
a
son
he
said
the
comrade
and
support
of
my
old
age
i
am
poor
as
the
world
goes
now
have
but
just
enough
to
live
modestly
in
this
retreat
where
life
costs
but
little
he
is
rich
and
can
give
you
a
handsome
seat
near
your
mansion
and
a
house
in
london
if
you
desire
one
less
splendid
doubtless
than
fareham
palace
on
the
thames
but
more
befitting
the
habits
and
manners
of
an
english
gentleman
wife
he
can
give
you
hounds
and
hawks
your
and
your
what
more
in
god
name
can
any
reasonable
woman
desire
only
one
thing
sir
to
live
my
own
life
in
peace
as
my
conscience
and
my
reason
bid
me
i
can
not
love
denzil
warner
though
of
late
i
have
grown
to
like
and
respect
him
as
a
friend
and
most
intelligent
companion
your
persistence
is
fast
changing
friendship
into
dislike
and
the
very
name
of
the
man
would
speedily
become
hateful
to
me
oh
i
have
done
retorted
sir
john
i
am
no
tyrant
you
must
take
your
own
way
mistress
i
can
but
lament
that
providence
gave
me
only
two
daughters
and
one
of
them
an
arrant
fool
he
left
her
in
a
huff
and
had
it
not
been
for
an
astonishing
event
which
convulsed
town
and
country
and
suspended
private
interests
and
private
quarrels
in
the
excitement
of
public
affairs
she
would
have
heard
much
more
of
his
discontent
the
dutch
ships
were
at
chatham
english
were
blazing
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
thames
and
there
was
panic
lest
the
triumphant
foe
should
sail
their
up
the
river
to
london
besiege
the
tower
relight
the
fire
whose
ashes
were
scarce
grown
cold
pillage
slaughter
destroy
as
tilly
had
destroyed
the
wretched
provinces
in
the
religious
war
here
in
this
sheltered
haven
amidst
green
fields
under
the
lee
of
the
brill
the
panic
and
consternation
were
as
intense
as
if
the
village
of
nicholas
were
the
one
spot
the
dutch
would
make
for
after
landing
and
indeed
there
were
rustics
who
went
to
the
placid
scene
where
the
infant
thame
rises
in
its
cradle
of
reed
and
lily
half
expectant
of
seeing
netherlandish
vessels
stranded
among
the
rushes
the
dutch
fleet
was
at
chatham
ships
were
being
sunk
across
the
medway
to
stop
the
invader
sheerness
was
to
be
fortified
london
was
in
arms
and
brill
remembered
its
repulse
of
hampden
regiment
with
a
proud
consciousness
of
being
invincible
the
dutch
fleet
saved
angela
many
a
paternal
lecture
for
sir
john
rode
towards
london
and
did
not
return
until
the
end
of
the
month
in
london
he
found
hyacinth
much
disturbed
about
her
husband
who
had
gone
as
volunteer
with
general
middleton
and
was
in
command
of
a
cavalry
regiment
at
chatham
i
never
saw
him
in
such
spirits
as
when
he
left
me
lady
fareham
told
her
father
i
believe
he
is
ever
happiest
when
he
breathes
gunpowder
sir
john
had
been
curt
and
moody
for
angela
offence
rankled
deep
in
his
mind
and
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
command
his
anger
even
in
bidding
her
did
i
not
tell
you
that
we
live
in
troubled
times
and
that
no
man
can
foresee
the
coming
evil
or
how
great
our
woes
and
distractions
may
be
he
asked
with
a
gloomy
triumph
whoever
thought
to
hear
de
ruyter
guns
at
sheerness
or
to
see
the
royal
charles
led
captive
absit
omen
who
knows
what
destruction
may
come
upon
that
other
royal
charles
for
whose
safety
we
pray
morning
and
night
and
who
lolls
across
a
perhaps
with
his
wantons
around
him
while
we
are
on
our
knees
supplicating
the
creator
for
him
who
knows
we
may
have
london
in
flames
again
and
a
conflagration
more
fatal
than
the
last
thou
obstinate
wench
before
thou
art
a
week
older
and
every
man
called
away
from
plough
and
pasture
to
serve
the
king
and
desolation
and
famine
where
plenty
now
smiles
at
us
and
is
this
a
time
in
which
to
refuse
a
valiant
and
wealthy
protector
a
lover
as
honest
as
ever
god
made
a
pious
conforming
christian
of
unsullied
name
a
young
man
after
my
own
pattern
a
fine
horseman
and
a
good
farmer
one
who
loves
a
pack
of
hounds
and
a
horse
a
flight
of
hawks
and
a
match
at
bowls
better
than
to
give
chase
to
a
in
the
mall
or
to
drink
himself
stark
mad
at
a
tavern
in
covent
garden
with
debauchees
from
whitehall
sir
john
prosed
and
grumbled
to
the
last
moment
but
could
not
refuse
to
bend
down
from
his
saddle
and
kiss
the
fair
pale
face
that
looked
at
him
in
piteous
deprecation
at
the
moment
of
parting
well
keep
a
brave
heart
mistress
wilful
thou
art
safe
here
yet
awhile
from
dutch
marauders
i
go
but
to
find
out
how
much
truth
there
is
in
these
panic
rumours
she
begged
him
not
to
fatigue
himself
with
too
long
stages
and
went
back
to
the
silent
house
thankful
to
be
alone
in
her
despondency
she
felt
as
if
the
last
page
in
her
worldly
life
had
been
written
she
had
to
turn
her
thoughts
backward
to
that
quiet
retreat
where
there
would
at
least
be
peace
she
had
promised
her
father
that
she
would
not
return
to
the
convent
while
he
wanted
her
at
home
but
was
that
promise
to
hold
good
if
he
were
to
embitter
her
life
by
urging
her
to
a
marriage
that
would
only
bring
her
unhappiness
she
had
ample
leisure
for
thought
in
one
summer
day
of
a
solitude
so
absolute
that
she
began
to
shiver
in
the
sultry
stillness
of
afternoon
and
scarce
ventured
to
raise
her
eyes
from
her
embroidery
frame
lest
some
shadowy
presence
some
ghost
out
of
the
dead
past
should
hover
near
watching
her
as
she
sat
alone
in
scenes
where
that
pale
spirit
had
been
living
flesh
the
thought
of
all
who
had
lived
and
died
in
that
house
men
and
women
of
her
own
race
whose
qualities
of
mind
and
person
she
had
inherited
oppressed
her
in
the
long
hours
of
silent
reverie
before
her
first
day
of
loneliness
had
ended
her
spirits
had
sunk
to
deepest
melancholy
and
in
that
weaker
condition
of
mind
she
had
begun
to
ask
herself
whether
she
had
any
right
to
oppose
her
father
wishes
by
denying
herself
to
a
suitor
whom
she
esteemed
and
respected
and
whose
filial
affection
would
bring
new
sunshine
into
that
dear
father
declining
years
she
had
noted
their
manner
to
each
other
during
denzil
protracted
visit
and
had
seen
all
the
evidences
of
a
warm
regard
on
both
sides
she
had
too
complete
a
faith
in
denzil
sterling
worth
to
question
the
reality
of
any
feeling
which
his
words
and
manner
indicated
he
was
above
all
things
a
man
of
truth
and
honesty
she
was
roaming
about
the
gardens
with
her
dog
towards
noon
in
the
second
day
of
her
solitude
when
across
the
yew
hedges
she
saw
white
clouds
of
dust
rising
from
the
and
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
roll
of
wheels
a
noise
as
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
whereat
ganymede
barked
himself
almost
into
an
apoplexy
and
rushed
across
the
grass
like
a
mad
thing
a
great
cracking
of
whips
and
sound
of
voices
horses
galloping
horses
trotting
dust
enough
to
whiten
all
the
hedges
and
greensward
angela
stood
at
gaze
wondering
if
the
dutch
were
coming
to
storm
the
old
house
or
the
county
militia
coming
to
garrison
it
the
manor
moat
was
the
destination
of
that
clamorous
troop
whoever
they
were
wheels
and
horses
stopped
sharply
at
the
great
iron
gate
in
front
of
the
house
and
the
bell
began
to
ring
furiously
while
other
dogs
with
voices
that
resembled
ganymede
answered
his
shrill
bark
with
even
shriller
yelpings
angela
ran
towards
the
gate
and
was
near
enough
to
see
it
opened
to
admit
three
spaniels
and
one
slim
personage
in
a
long
brocatelle
gown
and
a
large
beaver
hat
who
approached
with
stately
movements
a
small
pert
nose
held
high
and
rosy
upper
lip
curled
in
patrician
disdain
of
common
things
while
a
fan
of
peacock
plumage
that
flashed
sapphire
and
emerald
in
the
fierce
noonday
sun
was
waved
slowly
before
the
dainty
face
scattering
the
tremulous
life
of
summer
that
buzzed
and
fluttered
in
the
sultry
air
in
the
rear
of
this
brilliant
figure
appeared
a
person
in
a
grey
silk
gown
and
hood
and
a
negro
page
in
the
fareham
livery
a
and
a
tall
lackey
so
many
being
the
necessary
adjuncts
to
the
honourable
henrietta
maria
revel
state
when
she
went
abroad
angela
ran
to
receive
her
niece
with
a
cry
of
rapture
and
the
tall
slip
of
a
girl
in
the
frock
was
clasped
to
her
aunt
heart
with
a
ruthless
disregard
of
the
beaver
hat
and
cataract
of
ostrich
plumage
prends
garde
mon
chapeau
tante
cried
henriette
is
one
of
lewin
nell
gwyn
hats
and
cost
twenty
guineas
without
the
buckle
which
i
stole
out
of
father
shoe
day
his
lordship
is
so
careless
about
his
clothes
that
he
wore
the
shoes
two
days
and
never
knew
there
was
a
buckle
missing
and
those
lazy
devils
his
servants
never
told
him
i
believe
they
meant
to
rook
him
of
buckle
chatterer
chatterer
how
happy
i
am
to
see
thee
but
is
not
your
mother
with
you
her
ladyship
is
in
london
everybody
of
importance
is
scampering
off
to
london
and
no
doubt
will
be
rushing
back
to
the
country
again
if
the
dutch
take
the
tower
but
i
do
think
they
will
while
my
father
is
able
to
raise
a
regiment
and
mademoiselle
with
a
curtsy
to
the
lady
in
grey
has
brought
you
all
this
long
way
through
the
heat
to
see
me
i
have
brought
mademoiselle
henrietta
answered
contemptuously
before
the
frenchwoman
had
finished
the
moue
and
the
shrug
which
with
her
always
preceded
speech
and
a
fine
plague
i
had
to
make
her
come
madame
will
conceive
that
in
miladi
absence
it
was
a
prodigious
inconvenience
to
order
two
coaches
and
travel
so
far
his
lordship
groom
of
the
chambers
is
my
witness
that
i
protested
against
such
an
outrageous
proceeding
two
coaches
exclaimed
angela
a
for
me
and
my
dogs
and
my
gouvernante
and
a
for
my
people
explained
henriette
who
had
modelled
her
equipage
and
suite
upon
a
reminiscence
of
the
train
which
attended
lady
castlemaine
visit
to
chilton
as
beheld
from
a
nursery
window
come
child
and
rest
out
of
the
sun
and
you
mademoiselle
must
need
refreshment
after
so
long
a
drive
our
progress
through
a
perpetual
cloud
of
dust
and
a
succession
of
narrow
lanes
did
indeed
suggest
the
torments
of
purgatory
but
the
happiness
of
madame
gracious
welcome
is
an
compensation
for
our
fatigue
mademoiselle
replied
with
a
deep
curtsey
i
was
not
tired
in
the
least
asserted
henriette
we
stopped
at
the
crown
at
thame
and
had
strawberries
and
milk
had
strawberries
and
milk
mon
enfant
i
have
a
digestion
which
will
not
allow
such
liberties
and
our
horses
were
baited
and
our
people
had
their
morning
drink
said
henriette
with
her
air
one
ought
always
to
remember
cattle
and
servants
may
we
put
up
our
horses
with
you
auntie
we
must
leave
you
soon
after
dinner
so
as
to
be
at
chilton
by
sunset
or
mademoiselle
will
be
afraid
of
highwaymen
though
i
told
samuel
and
peter
to
bring
their
blunderbusses
in
case
of
an
attack
has
no
valuables
and
at
the
worst
i
should
but
have
to
give
them
my
diamond
buckle
and
my
locket
with
his
lordship
portrait
angela
cheeks
flushed
at
that
chance
allusion
to
fareham
picture
it
brought
back
a
vision
of
the
convent
parlour
and
she
standing
there
with
fareham
miniature
in
her
hand
wonderingly
contemplative
of
the
dark
strong
face
at
that
stage
of
her
life
she
had
seen
so
few
men
faces
and
this
one
had
a
power
in
it
that
startled
her
did
she
divine
by
some
supernatural
foreknowledge
that
this
face

old

crept
out
into
the
sunshine
with

rustic
footman
following
him
and
the
cook
was
looking
out
at
a
window
in
the

and

occupied

days

been
accustomed

on
all
stately
occasions
a
room
now
shabby
and
grey
with
disuse
while
the
footman
showed
the
way
to
the
stables
angela
drew
reuben
aside
for
a
brief
consultation
as
to
ways
and
means
for
a
dinner
that
must
be
the
best
the
house

provide
and
which
might
be
served
at

after

french
fashion

if
you

done
your

tante
let
me
go
to
your
favourite
with
you
and
tell
you
my
secrets
i
am
perishing
for
a
with
a
wave
of

take
a
siesta
and
forget
the
dust
of
the
road
while
we
converse
angela
ushered
mademoiselle
to
the
pretty
looking
out
upon
a
geometrical
arrangement
of
in
the
dutch
manner
chocolate
and
other
light
refreshments
were
being
prepared
for
the
travellers
but
henrietta
impatience
would
wait
for
nothing
i
have
not
driven
along
these
detestable
roads
to
taste
your
chocolate
she
protested
i
have
a
world
to
say
to
you
en
attendant
mademoiselle
you
will
consider
everything
at
your
disposal
in
the
house
of
my
grandfather
deux
heures
she
sank
almost
to
the
ground
in
a
whitehall
curtsy
rose
swift
as
an
arrow
tucked
her
arm
through
angela
and
pulled
her
out
of
the
room
paying
no
attention
to
the
governess
voluble
injunctions
not
to
expose
her
complexion
to
the
sun
or
to
sit
in
a
cold
wind
or
to
spoil
her
gown
what
a
shabby
old
place
it
is
she
said
looking
critically
round
her
as
they
went
through
the
gardens
i
afraid
you
must
perish
with
here
with
so
few
servants
and
no
company
to
speak
of
yes
contemplating
her
shrewdly
as
they
seated
themselves
in
a
stone
temple
at
the
end
of
the
you
are
looking
moped
and
ill
this
valley
air
does
not
agree
with
you
well
you
can
have
a
much
finer
place
whenever
you
choose
a
better
house
and
garden
ever
so
much
nearer
chilton
and
you
will
choose
wo
you
dearest
nestling
close
to
her
after
throwing
off
the
big
hat
which
made
such
loving
contact
impossible
i
do
understand
you
henriette
if
you
call
me
henriette
i
shall
be
sure
you
are
angry
with
me
no
love
not
angry
but
surprised
you
think
i
have
no
right
to
talk
of
your
sweetheart
because
i
am
only
thirteen
and
have
scarce
left
off
playing
with
babies
i
have
hated
them
for
ages
only
people
persist
in
giving
me
the
foolish
puppets
i
know
more
of
the
world
than
you
do
auntie
after
being
shut
in
a
convent
the
best
part
of
your
life
why
are
you
so
obstinate
ma
ch√©rie
in
refusing
a
gentleman
we
all
like
do
you
mean
sir
denzil
sans
doute
have
you
a
crowd
of
servants
no
child
only
this
one
but
do
you
see
that
other
people
liking
has
less
to
do
with
the
question
than
mine
and
if
i
do
not
like
him
well
enough
to
be
his
wife
but
you
ought
to
like
him
you
know
how
long
her
ladyship
heart
has
been
set
on
the
match
you
must
have
seen
what
pains
she
took
in
london
to
have
sir
denzil
always
about
you
and
now
after
a
most
exemplary
patience
after
being
your
faithful
servant
for
over
a
year
he
asks
you
to
be
his
wife
and
you
refuse
obstinately
refuse
and
you
would
rather
mope
here
with
my
poor
old
grandfather
in
abject
poverty
mother
says
poverty
than
be
the
honoured
mistress
of
one
of
the
finest
seats
in
oxfordshire
i
would
rather
do
what
is
right
and
honest
my
dearest
it
is
dishonest
to
marry
without
love
then
half
mother
fine
friends
must
be
dishonest
for
i
dare
swear
that
very
few
of
them
love
their
husbands
henriette
you
talk
of
things
you
do
know
do
know
why
there
is
no
one
in
london
knows
more
i
am
always
listening
and
i
always
remember
de
malfort
used
to
say
i
had
a
plaguey
long
memory
when
i
told
him
of
things
he
had
said
a
year
ago
my
dear
i
love
you
fondly
but
i
can
not
have
you
talk
to
me
of
what
you
do
understand
and
i
am
sorry
sir
denzil
warner
had
no
more
courtesy
than
to
go
and
complain
of
me
to
my
sister
he
did
not
come
to
chilton
to
complain
her
ladyship
met
him
on
the
way
from
oxford
in
her
coach
he
was
riding
and
she
called
to
him
to
come
to
the
coach
door
it
was
the
day
after
he
left
you
and
he
was
looking
miserable
and
she
questioned
him
and
he
owned
that
his
suit
had
been
rejected
and
he
had
no
further
hope
my
mother
came
home
in
a
rage
but
why
was
she
angry
with
his
lordship
indeed
she
rated
him
as
if
it
were
his
fault
you
refused
sir
denzil
angela
sat
silent
and
the
hand
henriette
was
clasping
grew
cold
as
ice
did
my
father
bid
you
refuse
him
aunt
asked
the
girl
scrutinising
her
aunt
countenance
with
those
dark
grey
eyes
so
like
fareham
in
their
falcon
brightness
no
child
why
should
he
interfere
it
is
no
business
of
his
then
why
was
mother
so
angry
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
towering
passion
is
your
doing
she
cried
she
were
not
your
adoring
slave
she
would
have
jumped
at
so
handsome
a
sweetheart
this
is
your
witchcraft
it
is
you
she
loves
you
you
you
his
lordship
stood
dumb
and
pointed
to
me
you
forget
your
child
is
present
he
said
forget
everything
except
that
everybody
uses
me
shamefully
she
cried
was
only
made
to
be
slighted
and
trampled
upon
his
lordship
made
no
answer
but
walked
to
the
door
in
that
way
he
ever
has
when
he
is
angered
pale
frowning
silent
i
was
standing
in
his
way
and
he
gripped
me
by
the
arm
and
dragged
me
out
of
the
room
i
dare
venture
there
is
a
bruise
on
my
arm
where
he
held
me
i
know
his
fingers
hurt
me
with
their
grip
and
i
could
hear
my
lady
screaming
and
sobbing
as
he
took
me
away
but
he
would
not
let
me
go
back
to
her
he
would
only
send
her
women
mother
has
an
interval
of
madness
he
said
are
best
out
of
her
presence
the
news
of
the
dutch
ships
came
the
same
evening
and
my
father
rode
off
towards
london
and
my
mother
ordered
her
coach
and
followed
an
hour
after
they
seemed
both
distracted
and
only
because
you
refused
sir
denzil
i
can
not
help
her
ladyship
foolishness
papillon
she
has
no
occasion
for
any
of
this
trouble
i
am
her
dutiful
affectionate
sister
but
my
heart
is
not
hers
to
give
or
to
refuse
but
was
it
indeed
my
father
fault
is
it
because
you
adore
him
that
you
refused
sir
denzil
no
no
no
my
affection
for
my
brother
he
has
been
to
me
as
a
brother
can
make
no
difference
in
my
regard
for
any
one
else
one
can
not
fall
in
love
at
another
ordering
or
be
happy
with
a
husband
of
choice
you
will
discover
that
for
yourself
papillon
perhaps
when
you
are
a
woman
oh
i
mean
to
marry
for
wealth
and
station
as
all
the
clever
women
do
said
papillon
with
an
upward
jerk
of
her
delicate
chin
lewin
always
says
i
ought
to
be
a
duchess
i
should
like
to
have
married
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
then
who
knows
i
might
have
been
a
queen
the
king
other
sons
are
too
young
for
me
and
they
will
never
have
monmouth
chance
but
indeed
sweetheart
you
ought
to
marry
sir
denzil
and
come
and
live
near
us
at
chilton
you
would
make
us
all
happy
ma
tres
ch√®re
it
is
so
easy
to
talk
but
when
thou
thyself
art
a
woman
i
shall
never
care
for
such
trumpery
as
love
i
mean
to
have
a
grand
house
ever
so
much
grander
than
fareham
house
perhaps
i
may
marry
a
frenchman
and
have
a
salon
and
all
the
wits
about
me
on
my
day
i
would
make
it
gayer
than
mademoiselle
de
scudery
saturdays
which
my
governess
so
loves
to
talk
of
there
should
be
less
talk
and
more
dancing
but
listen
tante
clasping
her
arms
suddenly
round
angela
neck
i
wo
leave
this
spot
till
you
have
promised
to
change
your
mind
about
denzil
i
like
him
vastly
and
i
sure
there
no
reason
why
you
should
not
love
him
unless
you
really
are
his
lordship
adoring
slave
emphasising
those
last
words
and
he
has
forbidden
you
angela
sat
dumb
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
why
you
are
like
the
lady
in
those
lines
you
made
me
learn
who
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
dearest
why
so
sad
remember
that
fine
house
and
the
dairy
that
was
once
a
chapel
you
could
turn
it
into
a
chapel
again
if
you
liked
and
have
your
own
chaplain
his
majesty
takes
no
heed
of
what
we
papists
do
being
a
papist
himself
at
heart
they
say
though
poor
wretches
are
dragged
off
to
gaol
for
worshipping
in
a
conventicle
what
is
a
conventicle
will
you
not
change
your
mind
dearest
answer
answer

the
slender
arms
tightened
their
caress
the
pretty
little
brown
face
pressed
itself
against
angela
pale
cold
cheek
for
my
sake
sweetheart
say
thou
wilt
have
him
i
will
go
to
see
thee
every
day
i
have
been
here
for
months
and
you
have
not
come
though
i
begged
you
in
a
dozen
letters
i
have
been
kept
at
my
book
and
my
dancing
lessons
mademoiselle
told
her
ladyship
that
i
was
a
monster
of
ignorance
i
have
been
treated
shamefully
i
could
not
have
come
had
my
lady
been
at
home
but
i
would
not
brook
a
hireling
dictation

she
was
almost
stifling
her
aunt
with
kisses
in
the
intervals
of
her
eager
speech
the
last
word
has
been
spoken
papillon
i
have
sent
him
away
and
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
refused
him
before
i
can
not
call
him
back
but
he
shall
come
without
calling
he
is
your
adoring
slave
cried
henriette
leaping
up
from
the
stone
bench
and
clapping
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
he
will
need
no
calling
dearest
dearest
most
exquisite
delectable
auntie
i
am
so
happy
and
my
mother
will
be
content
and
no
one
shall
ever
say
you
are
my
father
slave
henriette
if
you
repeat
that
odious
phrase
i
shall
hate
you
now
you
are
angry
god
what
a
frown
i
will
repeat
no
word
that
angers
you
my
lady
warner
sweet
lady
warner
i
vow
is
a
prettier
name
than
revel
or
fareham
you
are
mad
henriette
i
have
promised
nothing
yes
you
have
little
aunt
you
have
promised
to
drop
a
curtsy
and
say
when
sir
denzil
rides
this
way
you
sent
him
away
in
a
huff
he
will
come
back
smiling
like
yonder
sunshine
on
the
water
oh
i
am
so
happy
my
doing
all
my
doing
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
you
quite
useless
il

nous

i
shall
be
your
chief
bridesmaid
you
must
be
married
in
her
majesty
chapel
at
james
the
pope
will
give
his
dispensation
if
you
can
not
persuade
denzil
to
change
his
religion
were
he
my
suitor
i
would
twist
him
round
my
fingers
with
an
airy
gesture
of
the
small
brown
hand
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
than
to
convince
a
child
that
she
pleads
in
vain
for
any
ardently
desired
object
nothing
that
angela
could
say
would
reconcile
her
niece
to
the
idea
of
failure
so
there
was
no
help
but
to
let
her
fancy
her
arguments
conclusive
and
to
change
the
bent
of
her
thoughts
if
possible
it
wanted
nearly
an
hour
of
so
angela
suggested
an
inspection
of
the
home
farm
which
was
close
by
trusting
that
henriette
love
of
animals
would
afford
an
diversion
nor
was
she
disappointed
for
the
little
fine
lady
was
quite
as
much
at
home
in
stable
and
cowshed
as
in
a
london
and
spent
a
happy
hour
in
making
friends
with
the
live
stock
from
the
favourite
hereford
cow
queen
of
the
herd
to
the
smallest
bantam
in
the
to
this
rustic
entertainment
followed
dinner
in
the
preparation
of
which
banquet
marjory
cook
had
surpassed
herself
and
papillon
being
by
this
time
seriously
hungry
sat
and
feasted
to
her
heart
content
discussing
the
marrow
pudding
and
the
stewed
carp
with
the
acumen
and
authority
of
a
professed
gourmet
i
like
this
rustic
diet
she
said
condescendingly
she
reproached
her
governess
with
not
doing
justice
to
a
syllabub
but
showed
herself
a
fine
lady
by
her
complaint
at
the
lack
of
ice
for
her
wine
my
grandfather
should
make
haste
and
build
an
icehouse
before
next
winter
she
drawled
one
can
scarce
live
through
this
weather
without
ice
fanning
herself
with
excessive
languor
i
hope
dear
thou
wilt
not
expire
on
the
journey
home
the
coaches
were
at
the
gate
before
papillon
had
finished
dinner
and
mademoiselle
was
in
great
haste
to
be
gone
reminding
her
pupil
that
she
had
travelled
so
far
against
her
will
and
at
the
hazard
of
angering
madame
la
baronne
madame
la
baronne
will
be
enraptured
when
she
knows
what
i
have
done
to
please
her
answered
papillon
and
then
with
a
last
parting
embrace
hugging
her
aunt
fair
neck
more
energetically
than
ever
she
whispered
i
shall
tell
denzil
you
will
make
us
all
happy
a
cloud
of
dust
a
clatter
of
hoofs
screams
as
the
carriage
rocked
while
she
was
mounting
the
steps
and
with
much
cracking
of
whips
and
swearing
at
horses
from
the
postillions
who
had
taken
their
fill
of
ale
hog
harslet
and
cold
chine
and
lo
the
brilliant
vision
of
the
honourable
henrietta
maria
and
her
train
vanished
in
the
dust
of
the
summer
highway
and
angela
went
slowly
back
to
the
long
green
walk
beside
the
where
she
was
in
as
silent
a
solitude
but
for
a
lingering
nightingale
or
two
as
if
she
had
been
in
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
if
all
things
slumbered
not
there
was
at
least
as
marked
a
pause
in
life
the
dutch
might
be
burning
more
ships
and
the
noise
of
war
might
be
coming
nearer
london
with
every
hour
of
the
summer
day
here
there
was
a
repose
as
of
the
when
all
hopes
and
dreams
and
loves
and
hates
are
done
and
ended
and
the
soul
waits
in
darkness
and
silence
for
the
next
unfolding
of
its
wings
those
hateful
words
your
adoring
slave
and
all
that
speech
of
hyacinth
which
the
child
had
repeated
haunted
angela
with
an
agonising
iteration
she
had
not
an
instant
doubt
as
to
the
scene
being
faithfully
reported
she
knew
how
preternaturally
acute
henriette
intellect
had
become
in
the
rarified
atmosphere
of
her
mother
how
accurate
her
memory
how
sharp
her
ears
and
how
observant
her
eyes
whatever
henriette
reported
was
likely
to
be
to
the
very
letter
and
spirit
of
the
scene
she
had
witnessed
and
hyacinth
her
sister
had
put
this
shame
upon
her
had
spoken
of
her
in
the
cruelest
phrase
as
loving
one
whom
it
was
mortal
sin
to
love
hyacinth
so
light
so
airy
a
creature
whom
her
younger
sister
had
ever
considered
as
a
child
had
yet
been
shrewd
enough
to
fathom
her
mystery
and
to
discover
that
secret
attachment
which
had
made
denzil
suit
hateful
to
her
and
if
i
do
not
consent
to
marry
him
she
will
always
think
ill
of
me
she
will
think
of
me
as
a
wretch
who
tried
to
steal
her
husband
love
a
worse
woman
than
lady
castlemaine
for
she
had
the
king
affection
before
he
ever
saw
the
queen
poor
plain
face
his
adoring
slave
evening
shadows
were
around
her
she
had
wandered
into
the
woods
was
slowly
threading
the
slender
cattle
tracks
in
the
cool
darkness
while
that
passionate
song
of
the
nightingales
rose
in
a
louder
ecstasy
as
the
quiet
of
the
night
deepened
and
the
young
moon
hung
high
above
the
edge
of
a
wooded
hill
his
adoring
slave
she
repeated
with
her
hands
clasped
above
her
uncovered
head
hateful
humiliating
words
yet
there
was
a
keen
rapture
in
repeating
them
they
were
true
words
his
slave
his
slave
to
wait
upon
him
in
sickness
and
pain
to
lie
and
watch
at
his
door
like
a
faithful
dog
to
follow
him
to
the
wars
and
clean
his
armour
and
hold
his
horse
and
wait
in
his
tent
to
receive
him
wounded
and
heal
his
wounds
where
surgeons
failed
to
cure
wanting
that
intensity
of
attention
and
understanding
which
love
alone
can
give
to
be
his
bellario
asking
nothing
of
him
hoping
for
nothing
hardly
for
kind
words
or
common
courtesy
foregoing
woman
claim
upon
chivalry
content
to
be
nothing
only
to
be
near
him
if
such
a
life
could
have
been
the
life
that
poets
have
imagined
for
despairing
love
it
was
less
than
a
hundred
years
since
handsome
southwell
followed
sir
robert
dudley
to
italy
disguised
as
a
page
but
the
age
of
romance
was
past
the
modern
world
had
only
laughter
for
such
dreams
that
revelation
of
hyacinth
jealousy
had
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
something
must
be
done
angela
told
herself
and
quickly
to
set
her
right
with
her
sister
and
in
her
own
esteem
she
had
to
choose
between
a
loveless
marriage
and
the
convent
by
accepting
one
or
the
other
she
must
prove
that
she
was
not
the
slave
of
a
dishonourable
love
marriage
or
the
convent
it
had
been
easy
contemplating
the
step
from
a
distance
to
choose
the
convent
but
when
she
thought
of
it
amid
the
exquisite
beauty
of
these
woods
with
the
moonlit
valley
lying
at
her
feet
the
winding
streams
reflecting
that
silvery
light
or
veiled
in
a
pale
haze
in
the
liberty
and
loveliness
of
the
earth
the
vision
of
convent
walls
filled
her
with
a
shuddering
horror
to
be
shut
in
that
flemish
garden
for
ever
her
life
enclosed
within
the
straight
lines
of
that
long
green
alley
leading
to
a
dead
wall
darkened
over
by
flowerless
ivy
how
witheringly
dull
the
old
life
showed
looking
back
at
it
after
years
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
action
and
variety
no
no
no
she
could
not
bury
herself
alive
could
not
forego
the
liberty
to
wander
in
a
wood
like
this
to
gaze
upon
scenes
as
beautiful
as
yonder
valley
to
read
the
poets
she
loved
to
see
perhaps
some
day
those
romantic
scenes
which
she
knew
but
as
dreams
florence
vallombrosa
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
milton
to
see
the
venice
she
had
read
of
in
howell
letters
to
kneel
at
the
feet
of
the
holy
father
in
the
city
of
cities
all
these
things
would
be
for
ever
forbidden
to
her
if
she
chose
the
common
escape
from
earthly
sorrow
she
thought
of
her
whose
example
had
furnished
the
theme
of
many
a
discourse
at
the
convent
mazarin
lovely
niece
the
princess
de
conti
who
in
the
bloom
of
early
womanhood
was
awakened
from
the
dream
of
this
life
to
the
reality
of
heaven
and
had
renounced
the
pleasures
of
the
most
brilliant
court
in
the
world
for
the
severities
of
port
royal
she
thought
of
that
sublime
heretic
ferrar
whose
later
existence
was
one
long
prayer
of
how
much
baser
a
clay
must
she
be
fashioned
when
her
too
earthly
heart
clung
so
fondly
to
the
loveliness
of
earth
and
shrank
with
aversion
from
the
prospect
of
a
long
life
within
those
walls
where
her
childhood
had
been
so
peaceful
and
happy
how
changed
how
changed
and
corrupted
this
heart
has
become
she
murmured
in
her
dejection
when
that
life
which
was
once
my
most
ardent
desire
now
seems
to
me
worse
than
the
grave
anything
any
life
of
duty
in
the
world
rather
than
that
living
death
she
was
in
the
garden
next
morning
at
six
after
a
sleepless
night
and
she
occupied
herself
till
noon
in
going
about
among
the
cottagers
carrying
those
small
comforts
which
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
them
and
listening
patiently
to
those
various
distresses
which
they
were
very
glad
to
relate
to
her
she
taught
the
children
and
read
to
the
sick
and
was
able
in
this
round
of
duties
to
keep
her
thoughts
from
dwelling
too
persistently
upon
her
own
trouble
after
the
one
dinner
at
which
she
offended
old
reuben
by
eating
hardly
anything
she
went
for
a
woodland
ramble
with
her
dogs
and
it
was
near
sunset
when
she
returned
to
the
house
just
in
time
to
see
two
horses
being
led
away
from
the
hall
door
sir
john
had
come
home
she
found
him
in
the
dining
parlour
sitting
gloomy
and
weary
looking
before
the
table
where
reuben
was
arranging
a
hasty
meal
i
have
eaten
nothing
upon
the
road
yet
i
have
but
a
poor
stomach
for
your
he
said
and
then
looked
up
at
his
daughter
with
a
moody
glance
as
she
went
towards
him
dear
sir
we
must
try
to
coax
your
appetite
when
you
have
rested
a
little
let
me
unbuckle
your
spurs
and
pull
off
your
boots
while
reuben
fetches
your
easiest
shoes
nay
child
that
is
man
work
not
for
such
fingers
as
yours
the
boots
are
nowise
irksome
is
another
kind
of
shoe
that
pinches
angela
she
knelt
down
to
unbuckle
the
and
while
on
her
knees
she
said
you
look
sad
sir
i
fear
you
found
ill
news
at
london
i
found
such
shame
as
never
came
before
upon
england
such
confusion
as
only
traitors
and
profligates
can
know
men
who
have
cheated
and
lied
and
wasted
the
public
money
left
our
fortresses
undefended
our
ships
unarmed
our
sailors
unpaid
and
mutinous
clamorous
wives
crying
aloud
in
the
streets
that
their
husbands
should
not
fight
and
bleed
for
a
king
who
starved
them
they
have
clapped
the
scoundrel
who
had
charge
of
the
yard
at
chatham
in
the
tower
but
will
that
mend
matters
a
scapegoat
belike
to
suffer
for
higher
scoundrels
the
mob
is
loudest
against
the
chancellor
who
i
doubt
is
not
to
blame
for
our
unreadiness
having
little
power
of
late
over
the
king
oh
there
has
been
iniquity
upon
iniquity
and
men
know
not
whom
most
to
blame
the
venal
idle
servants
or
the
master
of
all
you
mean
that
men
blame
his
majesty
no
angela
but
when
our
ships
were
blazing
at
chatham
and
the
dutch
triumphing
the
cry
was
for
an
hour
of
old
noll
charles
has
played
his
cards
so
that
he
has
made
the
loyalest
hearts
in
england
wish
the
brewer
back
again
they
called
him
the
tiger
of
the
seas
we
have
no
tigers
now
only
asses
and
monkeys
why
there
was
scarce
a
grain
of
sense
left
in
london
the
beat
of
the
drums
calling
out
the
seemed
to
have
stupefied
the
people
everywhere
madness
and
confusion
they
have
sunk
their
richest
argosies
at
barking
creek
to
block
the
river
but
the
dutch
break
chains
ride
over
sunken
ships
laugh
our
petty
defences
to
scorn
dear
sir
this
confusion
can
not
last
it
will
last
as
long
as
the
world
history
lasts
our
humiliation
will
never
be
forgotten
but
englishmen
will
not
look
on
idle
there
must
be
brave
men
up
in
arms
oh
there
are
brave
men
enough

to

is
no

and

are
being
raised
but

should
be
quick
to
help
us
hang
back
our

is
empty
and
half
the
goldsmiths
in
london
are
bankrupt
and
our
ships
that
are
burnt
and
our
ships
that
are
taken
will
not
be
conjured
back
again
the
carried
off
with
insulting
triumph
oh
child
it
is
not
the
loss
that
galls
it
is
the
dishonour
he
took
a
draught
of
claret
out
of
the
tankard
which
angela
placed
at
his
elbow
and
she
carved
the
ham
for
him
and
persuaded
him
to
eat
is
it
the
public
misfortune
that
troubles
you
so
sadly
sir
she
asked
presently
when
her
father
flung
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
a
heavy
sigh
nay
angela
i
have
my
peck
of
trouble
without
reckoning
the
ruin
of
my
country
but
my
back
is
broad
it
can
bear
a
burden
as
well
as
any
do
you
count
a
disobedient
daughter
among
your
cares
sir
disobedient
is
too
harsh
a
word
i
told
you
i
would
never
force
your
inclinations
but
i
have
an
obstinate
daughter
who
has
disappointed
me
and
broken
my
spirit
your
spirit
shall
not
rest
broken
if
my
obedience
can
mend
it
sir
she
said
gently
dropping
on
her
knees
beside
his
chair
what
has
that
stony
heart
relented
wilt
thou
marry
him
sweetheart
wilt
give
me
a
son
as
well
as
a
daughter
and
the
security
that
thou
wilt
be
safe
and
happy
when
i
gone
no
one
can
be
sure
of
happiness
father
it
comes
strangely
and
goes
we
know
not
why
but
if
it
will
make
your
heart
easier
sir
and
denzil
be
still
of
the
same
mind
his
mind
his
rock
dearest
he
swore
to
me
that
he
could
never
change
ah
love
you
have
made
me
happy
let
the
fleet
burn
the
fly
dutch
colours
here
in
this
quiet
valley
there
shall
be
a
peaceful
household
and
united
hearts
angela
i
love
that
youth
fareham
with
all
his
rank
and
wealth
has
never
been
so
dear
to
me
that
black
visage
repels
love
but
denzil
countenance
is
open
as
the
day
i
can
say
dimittis
with
a
light
heart
i
can
trust
denzil
warner
with
my
happiness
chapter
xxiv
quite
out
of
fashion
denzil
received
the
good
news
by
the
hands
of
a
mounted
messenger
in
the
following
forenoon
the
knight
had
written
ride
ride
ride
in
the
elizabethan
style
on
the
cover
of
his
letter
which
contained
but
two
brief
sentences
womanlike
she
has
changed
her
mind
come
when
thou
wilt
dear
son
and
the
lost
not
an
hour
he
was
at
the
manor
before
he
was
a
member
of
the
quiet
household
again
subservient
to
his
mistress
in
everything
there
are
some
words
that
must
needs
be
spoken
before
we
are
agreed
angela
said
when
they
found
themselves
alone
for
the
first
time
in
the
garden
on
the
morning
after
his
return
and
when
denzil
would
fain
have
taken
her
to
his
breast
and
ratified
their
betrothal
with
a
kiss
i
think
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
is
my
father
wish
that
has
made
me
change
so
long
as
you
change
not
again
dear
i
am
of
all
men
the
happiest
yes
i
know
is
sir
john
wooing
that
won
you
not
mine
and
that
i
have
still
to
conquer
your
heart
though
your
hand
is
promised
me
yet
i
do
not
despair
of
being
loved
in
as
full
measure
as
i
love
my
faith
is
strong
in
the
power
of
an
honest
affection
you
may
at
least
be
sure
of
my
honesty
i
profess
nothing
but
the
desire
to
be
your
true
and
obedient
wife
obedient
you
shall
be
my
empress
no
no
i
have
no
wish
to
rule
i
desire
only
to
make
my
father
happy
and
you
too
sir
if
i
can
ah
my
soul
that
is
so
easy
for
you
you
have
but
to
let
me
live
in
your
dear
company
i
doubt
i
would
rather
be
miserable
with
you
than
happy
with
any
other
woman
me
if
you
will
play
zantippe
and
i
will
be
more
submissive
than
socrates
but
you
are
all
mildness
perfect
christian
perfect
woman
you
can
not
miss
being
perfect
as
wife
and
another
word
trembled
on
his
lips
but
he
checked
himself
lest
he
should
offend
and
the
speech
ended
in
a
sob
my
angela
my
angel
he
took
her
to
his
heart
and
kissed
the
fair
brow
cold
under
his
passionate
kisses
that
word
angel
turned
her
to
ice
it
conjured
back
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
it
was
sin
to
remember
fareham
had
called
her
so
not
once
but
many
times
in
their
placid
days
of
friendship
before
the
fiery
breath
of
passion
had
withered
all
the
flowers
in
her
earthly
paradise
before
the
knowledge
of
evil
had
clouded
the
brightness
of
the
world
a
gentle
peace
reigned
at
the
manor
after
angela
betrothal
sir
john
was
happier
than
he
had
been
since
the
days
of
his
youth
before
the
coming
of
that
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
when
john
hampden
stubborn
resistance
of
a
rate
had
brought
crown
and
people
face
to
face
upon
the
burning
question
of

kindled
the
fire
that
was
to
devour
england
from
the
hour
he
left
his
young
wife
to
follow
the
king
to
yorkshire
sir
john
existence
had
known
little
of
rest
or
of
comfort
or
even
of
glory
he
had
fought
on
the
losing
side
and
had
missed
the
fame
of
those
who
fell
and
took
the
rank
of
heroes
by
an
untimely
death
hardship
and
danger
wounds
and
sickness
straitened
means
and
scanty
fare
had
been
his
portion
for
three
bitter
years
and
then
had
come
a
period
of
patient
service
of
schemes
and
intrigues
foredoomed
to
failure
of
going
to

might

futile

unskilful

on

till
the
last
fatal
journey
on
which
he
was
an
unwilling
attendant
the
flight
from

to
titchfield
when
the
fated
king
broke
faith
with
his
enemies
in
an
unfinished
negotiation
foreign
adventure
had
followed
english
hardships
and
the
soldier
had
been
tossed
on
the
stormy
sea
of
european
warfare
he
had
been
graciously
received
at
the
french
court
but
only
to
feel
himself
a
stranger
there
and
to
have
his
english
clothes
and
english
accent
laughed
at
by
gramont
and
bussy
and
the
accomplished
√©vremond
and
the
frivolous
herd
of
their
imitators
to
see
even
the
queen
for
whom
he
had
spent
his
last
jacobus
smile
behind
her
fan
at
his
b√©vues
and
whisper
to
her
while
he
knelt
to
kiss
the
little
white
hand
that
had
led
a
king
to
ruin
everywhere
the
stern
malignant
had
found
himself
outside

at

for

not

flashed

there
everywhere
he
had
been
a
stranger
and
aloof
it
was
only
under
canvas
in
danger
and
privation

he
lost

the
stout

to
no

in

splendid
army
was
of
the
stamp
of
an
earlier
race
even
better
inured
to
hardship
than
any
save
that
heroic
prince
the
achilles
of
his
day
who
to
the
graces
of
a
modern
courtier
joined
the
temper
of
an
ancient
greek
his
daughter
hyacinth
had
given
him
the
utmost
affection
which
such
a
nature
could
give
but
it
was
the
affection
of
a
trained
or
a
spaniel
and
the
father
though
he
admired
her
beauty
and
was
pleased
with
her
caresses
was
shrewd
enough
to
perceive
the
lightness
of
her
disposition
and
the
shallowness
of
her
mind
he
rejoiced
in
her
marriage
with
a
man
of
fareham
strong
character
i
have
married
thee
to
a
husband
who
will
know
how
to
rule
a
wife
he
told
her
on
the
night
of
her
wedding
you
have
but
to
obey
and
to
be
happy
for
he
is
rich
enough
to
indulge
all
your
fancies
and
will
not
complain
if
you
waste
the
gold
that
would
pay
a
company
of
foot
on
the
decoration
of
your
poor
little
person
the
tone
in
which
you
speak
of
my
poor
little
person
sir
can
but
remind
me
how
much
i
need
the
tailor
and
the
milliner
answered
hyacinth
dropping
her
favourite
curtsy
which
she
was
ever
ready
to
practise
at
the
slightest
provocation
nay
petite
chatte
you
know
i
think
you
the
loveliest
creature
at
saint
germain
or
the
louvre
far
surpassing
in
beauty
the
cardinal
niece
who
has
managed
to
set
young
louis
heart
throbbing
with
a
boyish
passion
but
i
doubt
you
bestow
too
much
care
on
the
cherishing
of
a
gift
so
fleeting
you
have
said
the
word
sir
is
because
it
is
so
fleeting
i
must
needs
take
care
of
my
beauty
we
poor
women
are
like
the
butterflies
and
the
roses
we
have
as
brief
a
summer
you
men
who
value
us
only
for
our
outward
show
should
pardon
some
vanity
in
creatures
so
ephemeral
ephemeral
scarce
applies
to
a
sex
which
owns
such
an
example
as
your
grandmother
who
has
lived
to
reckon
her
servants
among
the
grandsons
of
her
earliest
lovers
not
lived
sir
no
woman
lives
after

she
can

still
admired

she
wo
own
it
ah
sir
un
triste
supplice
to
i
wonder
how
those
poor
ghosts
can
bear
that
earthly
purgatory
which
they
call
old
age
look
at
madame
de
sabl√©
par
exemple
once
a
beauty
now
only
a
tradition
and
queen
anne
old
people
say
she
was
beautiful
and
that
buckingham
risked
being
torn
by
wild
horses
like
ravaillac
only
to
kiss
her
hand
by
stealth
in
a
moonlit
garden
and
would
have
plunged
england
in
war
but
for
an
excuse
to
come
back
to
paris
who
would
go
to
war
for
anne
haggard
countenance
nowadays
even
in
lady
fareham
household
the
cavalier
soon
began
to
fancy
himself
an
inhabitant
too
much
a
dull
grey
ghost
from
a
tragical
past
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
talking
of
the
martyred
king
and
those
bitter
years
through
which
he
had
followed
his
master
sinking
fortunes
he
told
stories
of
york
and
of
beverley
of
the
scarcity
of
cash
which
reduced
his
majesty
court
to
but
one
table
of
that
bitter
affront
at
coventry
of
the
evil
omens
that
had
marked
the
raising
of
the
standard
on
the
hill
at
nottingham
and
filled
superstitious
minds
with
dark
forebodings
reminding
old
men
of
that
sad
shower
of
rain
that
fell
when
charles
was
proclaimed
at
whitehall
on
the
day
of
his
accession
and
of
the
shock
of
earthquake
on
his
coronation
day
of
edgehill
and
lindsey
death
of
the
profligate
conduct
of
the
cavalier
regiments
and
the
steady
dogged
force
of
their
adversaries
of
queen
henrietta
courage
and
beauty
and
wilfulness
and
her
fatal
influence
upon
an
adoring
husband
she
wanted
to
be
all
that
buckingham
had
been
said
sir
john
forgetting
that
buckingham
was
the
king
evil
genius
that
lively
and
eminently
artificial
society
of
the
rue
de
touraine
soon
wearied
of
sir
john
reminiscences
king
charles
execution
had
receded
into
the
dim
grey
of
history
he
might
as
well
have
told
them
anecdotes
of
cinq
mars
or
of
the
great
henri
or
of
moses
or
abraham
life
went
on
rapid
wheels
in
patrician
paris
they
had
cond√©
to
talk
about
and
mazarin
numerous
nieces
and
the
opera
that
new
importation
from
italy
which
the
cardinal
was
bringing
into
fashion
while
in
the
remote
past
of
half
a
dozen
years
back
the
fronde
was
the
only
interesting
subject
and
even
that
was
worn
threadbare
the
adventures
of
the
duchess
the
conduct
of
the
prince
in
prison
the
intrigues
of
cardinal
and
queen
mademoiselle
beaufort
duels
of
five
against
five
all
all
these
were
ancient
history
as
compared
with
young
louis
and
his
passion
for
marie
de
mancini
and
the
scheming
of
her
wily
uncle
to
marry
all
his
nieces
to
reigning
princes
or
embryo
kings
and
then
the
affectations
and
conceits
of
that
elegant
circle
the
sonnets
and
madrigals
the
the
practical
jokes
the
and
of
those
intellects
the
romances
where
the
personages
of
the
day
masqueraded
under
greek
or
roman
or
oriental
aliases
books
written
in
a
flowery
language
which
the
cavalier
did
not
understand
and
full
of
allusions
that
were
dark
to
him
while
not
to
know
and
appreciate
those
placed
him
outside
the
pale
he
rejoiced
in
escaping
from
that
overcharged
atmosphere
to
the
tavern
to
the
camp
anywhere
he
followed
the
exiled
stuarts
in
their
wanderings
paid
his
homage
to
the
princess
of
orange
roamed
from
scene
to
scene
a
stranger
and
one
too
many
wherever
he
went
then
came
the
hardest
blow
of
all
the
chilling
disillusion
that
awaited
many
of
charles
faithful
friends
who
were
not
of
such
political
importance
as
to
command
their
recompense
neglect
and
forgetfulness
were
sir
john
kirkland
portion
and
for
him
and
for
such
as
he
that
caustic
definition
of
the
act
of
indemnity
was
a
hard
and
cruel
truth
it
was
an
act
of
indemnity
for
the
king
enemies
and
of
oblivion
for
his
friends
sir
john
spirits
had
hardly
recovered
from
the
bitterness
of
disappointed
affection
when
he
came
back
to
the
old
home
though
his
chagrin
was
seven
years
old
but
now
in
his
delight
at
the
alliance
with
denzil
warner
he
seemed
to
have
renewed
his
lease
of
cheerfulness
and
bodily
vigour
he
rode
and
walked
about
the
lanes
and
woods
with
erect
head
and
elastic
limbs
he
played
bowls
with
denzil
in
the
summer
evenings
he
went
fishing
with
his
daughter
and
her
sweetheart
he
revelled
in
the
simple
rustic
life
and
told
them
stories
of
his
boyhood
when
james
was
king
and
many
a
queer
story
of
that
eccentric
monarch
and
of
the
rising
star
george
villiers
ah
what
a
history
that
was
he
exclaimed
his
mother
trained
him
as
if
with
a
foreknowledge
of
that
ascendency
he
was
schooled
to
shine
and
dazzle
to
excel
all
compeers
in
the
graces
men
and
women
admire
i
doubt
she
never
thought
of
the
mind
inside
him
or
cared
whether
he
had
a
heart
or
a
lump
of
marble
behind
his
he
was
taught
neither
to
think
nor
to
pity
only
to
shine
to
be
quick
with
his
tongue
in
half
a
dozen
languages
with
his
sword
after
half
a
dozen
modes
of
fence
he
could
kill
his
man
in
the
french
or
the
italian
or
the
spanish
manner
he
was
cosmopolitan
in
the
knowledge
of
evil
he
had
every
device
that
can
make
a
man
brilliant
and
dangerous
he
mounted
every
rung
of
the
ladder
leaping
from
step
to
step
he
ascended
swift
as
a
shooting
star
from
plain
country
gentleman
to
the
level
of
princes
and
he
expired
with
an
ejaculation
astonished
to
find
himself
mortal
slain
in
a
moment
by
the
thrust
of
a
knife
i
remember
as
if
it
were
yesterday
how
men
looked
and
spoke
when
the
news
came
to
london
and
how
some
said
this
murder
would
be
the
saving
of
king
charles
i
know
of
one
man
at
least
who
was
glad
who
was
he
sir
asked
denzil
he
who
had
the
greatest
mind
among
englishmen
thomas
wentworth
buckingham
had
held
him
at
a
distance
from
the
king
and
his
strong
passionate
temper
was
seething
with
indignation
at
being
kept
aloof
by
that
silken
sybarite
an
impotent
general
a
fatal
counsellor
after
the
favourite
death
there
came
a
time
of
peace
and
plenty
the
pestilence
had
passed
the
war
was
over
charles
was
happy
with
his
henriette
and
their
lovely
children
wentworth
was
in
ireland
the
parliament
house
stood
still
and
empty
doors
shut
swallows
building
under
the
eaves
i
look
back
and
those
placid
years
melt
into
each
other
like
one
long
summer
and
then
again
as
yesterday
i
hear
hampden
drums
and
fifes
in
the
lanes
and
see
the
rebels
flag
with
that
hateful
legend
nulla
retrorsum
and
buckinghamshire
peasants
are
under
arms
and
the
king
and
his
people
have
begun
to
hate
and
fear
each
other
none
foresaw
that
the
war
would
last
so
long
or
end
in
murder
i
doubt
sir
said
angela
nay
child
we
who
were
loyal
thought
to
see
that
rabble
withered
by
the
breath
of
kingly
nostrils
a
word
should
have
brought
them
to
the
dust
there
might
be
so
easy
a
victory
perhaps
sir
from
a
king
who
knew
how
to
speak
the
right
word
at
the
right
moment
how
to
comply
graciously
with
a
just
demand
and
how
to
be
firm
in
a
righteous
denial
replied
denzil
but
with
charles
a
stammering
speech
was
but
the
outward
expression
of
a
wavering
mind
he
was
a
man
who
never
listened
to
an
appeal
but
always
yielded
to
a
threat
were
it
only
loud
enough
the
wedding
was
to
be
soon
marriages
were
patched
up
quickly
in
the
sixties
and
here
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
sir
john
had
found
denzil
compliant
on
every
minor
question
and
willing
to
make
his
home
at
the
manor
during
his
mother
lifetime
the
old
lady
would
never
stomach
a
papist
said
sir
john
and
denzil
was
fain
to
confess
that
lady
warner
would
not
easily
reconcile
herself
with
angela
creed
though
she
could
not
fail
of
loving
angela
herself
my
daughter
would
have
neither
peace
nor
liberty
under
a
puritan
roof
sir
john
said
and
i
should
have
neither
son
nor
daughter
and
should
be
a
loser
by
my
girl
marriage
you
shall
be
as
much
master
here
denzil
as
if
this
were
your
own
house
which
it
will
be
when
i
have
moved
to
my
last
billet
give
me
a
couple
of
stalls
for
my
roadsters
and
kennel
room
for
my
dogs
and
i
want
no
more
you
and
angela
may
introduce
as
many
new
fashions
as
you
like
dine
at
two
and
sip
your
unwholesome
indian
drink
of
an
evening
the
fine
ladies
in
paris
were
beginning
to
take
tea
when
i
was
last
there
though
by
the
faces
they
made
over
the
stuff
it
might
have
been
poison
i
can
smoke
my
pipe
in
the
and
look
on
and
admire
at
the
new
generation
i
shall
not
feel
myself
one
too
many
at
your
fireside
as
i
used
sometimes
in
the
rue
de
touraine
when
those
strutting
gallic
cocks
were
quizzing
me
there
were
clouds
of
dust
and
a
clatter
of
hoofs
again
in
front
of
the
floriated
iron
gate
but
this
time
it
was
not
the
honourable
henriette
who
came
tripping
along
the
gravel
path
on
heels
but
my
lady
fareham
who
walked
languidly
with
the
assistance
of
a
cane
and
who
looked
pale
and
thin
in
her
satin
gown
and
petticoat
she
too
came
attended
by
a
second
coach
which
was
filled
by
her
ladyship
french
lewin
and
a
pile
of
boxes
and
parcels
i
wager
that
in
the
rapture
and
romance
of
your
sweethearting
you
have
not
given
a
thought
to
petticoats
and
mantuas
she
said
after
she
had
embraced
her
sister
who
was
horrified
at
the
sight
of
that
painted
harridan
from
london
angela
blushed
at
those
words
rapture
and
romance
knowing
how
little
there
had
been
of
either
in
her
thoughts
or
in
denzil
sober
courtship
romance
alas
there
had
been
but
one
romance
in
her
life
and
that
a
guilty
one
which
she
must
ever
remember
with
remorse
come
now
confess
you
have
not
a
gown
ordered
i
have
gowns
enough
and
to
spare
oh
sister
have
you
come
so
far
to
talk
of
gowns
and
that
odious
woman
too
what
brought
her
here
angela
asked
with
more
temper
than
she
was
wont
to
show
my
sisterly
kindness
brought
her
you
are
an
ungrateful
hussy
for
looking
vexed
when
i
have
come
a
score
of
miles
through
the
dust
to
do
you
a
service
ah
dearest
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
coming
but
alas
you
are
looking
pale
and
thin
heaven
forbid
that
you
have
been
indisposed
and
we
in
ignorance
of
your
suffering
no
i
am
well
enough
though
every
one
assures
me
i
look
ill
which
is
but
a
civil
mode
of
telling
me
i
am
growing
old
and
ugly
nay
hyacinth
the
former
we
must
all
become
with
time
the
latter
you
will
never
be
your
servant
sir
denzil
has
taught
you
to
pay
antique
compliments
well
now
we
will
talk
business
i
had
occasion
to
send
for
lewin
my
toilet
was
in
a
horrid
state
of
decay
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
knowing
your
foolish
indifference
that
even
your
wedding
gown
would
not
be
chosen
unless
i
saw
to
it
so
here
is
lewin
with
lyons
and
genoa
silks
of
the
very
latest
patterns
she
has
but
just
come
from
paris
and
is
full
of
parisian
modes
and
court
scandals
the
king
posted
off
to
versailles
directly
after
his
mother
death
and
has
not
returned
to
the
louvre
since
he
amuses
himself
by
spending
millions
on
building
and
making
passionate
love
to
mademoiselle
la
valli√®re
who
encourages
him
by
pretending
an
excessive
modesty
and
exaggerates
every
favour
by
penitential
tears
i
doubt
his
attachment
to
so
melancholy
a
mistress
will
hardly
last
a
lifetime
she
is
not
beautiful
she
has
a
halting
gait
and
she
is
no
more
virtuous
than
any
other
young
woman
who
makes
a
show
of
resistance
to
enhance
the
merit
of
her
surrender
hyacinth
prattled
all
the
way
to
the
parlour
lewin
and
the
following
laden
with
parcels
queer
dear
old
hovel
she
exclaimed
sinking
languidly
upon
a
tabouret
and
fanning
herself
exhaustedly
while
the
opened
her
boxes
and
laid
out
her
sample
breadths
of
richly
decorated
brocade
or
silver
and
gold
enwrought
satin
how
well
i
remember
being
whipped
over
my
in
this
very
room
and
there
is
the
bowling
green
where
i
used
to
race
with
the
italian
greyhound
my
grandmother
brought
me
from
paris
i
look
back
and
it
seems
a
dream
of
some
other
child
running
about
in
the
sunshine
it
is
so
hard
to
believe
that
joyous
little
being
who
knew
not
the
meaning
of
was
i
why
that
sigh
sister
surely
none
ever
had
less
cause
for
than
you
have
i
not
cause
not
when
my
glass
tells
me
youth
is
gone
and
beauty
is
waning
not
when
there
is
no
one
in
this
wide
world
who
cares
a
straw
whether
i
am
handsome
or
hideous
i
would
as
lief
be
dead
as
despised
and
neglected

murmured
angela
come
and
look
at
the
old
gardens
sister
while
lewin
spreads
out
her
wares
and
pray
consider
madam
turning
to
the
that
those
peacock
purples
and
gold
embroideries
have
no
temptations
for
me
i
am
marrying
a
country
gentleman
and
am
to
lead
a
country
life
my
gowns
must
be
such
as
will
not
be
spoilt
by
a
walk
in
dusty
lanes
or
a
visit
to
a
cottage
eh
gud
your
ladyship
do
not
tell
me
that
you
would
bury
so
much
beauty
among
sheep
and
cows
and
odious
ploughmen
wives
and
a
month
or
so
of
rustic
life
in
summer
between
epsom
and
tunbridge
wells
may
be
well
enough
to
rest
your
beauty
without
patches
or
a
french
head
out
of
sight
of
your
admirers
but
to
live
in
the
country
only
a
jealous
husband
could
ever
propose
more
than
an
annual
six
weeks
of
rustic
seclusion
to
a
wife
under
sixty
lord
chesterfield
was
considered
as
cruel
for
taking
his
countess
to
the
rocks
and
ravines
of
derbyshire
as
sir
john
denham
for
poisoning
his
poor
lady
chut

loin
lewin
remonstrated
lady
fareham
but
in
truly
your
ladyship
when
i
hear
kirkland
talk
of
a
husband
who
would
have
her
waste
her
beauty
upon
and
and
never
wear
a
mantua
worth
looking
at
i
doubt
my
husband
will
be
guided
by
his
own
likings
rather
than
by
lewin
tastes
and
opinions
said
angela
with
a
stately
curtsy
which
was
designed
to
put
the
forward
tradeswoman
in
her
place
and
which
took
that
personage
breath
away
there
never
was
anything
like
the
insolence
of
a
handsome
young
woman
before
she
has
been
educated
by
a
lover
she
said
to
her
frenchwoman
with
a
vindictive
smile
and
scornful
shrug
of
bloated
shoulders
when
the
sisters
had
left
the
parlour
but
wait
till
her
first
intrigue
and
then
it
is
dearest
lewin
wilt
thou
make
me
everlastingly
beholden
to
thee
by
taking
this
letter
thou
knowest
to
whom
or
in
a
flood
of
tears
you
are
my
only
friend
and
if
you
can
not
find
me
some
good
and
serviceable
woman
who
would
give
me
a
home
where
i
can
hide
from
the
cruel
eye
of
the
world
i
must
take
poison
no
insolence
then
mark
you
madame
hortense
this
demoiselle
is
none
of
your
sort
hortense
said
you
must
not
judge
english
ladies
by
your
maids
of
honour

well
if
she
thinks
i
am
going
to
make
up
linsey
woolsey
or
norwich

she
will
find
her
mistake
i
never
courted
the
custom
of
little
gentlemen
wives
with
a
hundred
a
year
for
if
i
am
to
do
anything
for
this
peacock
lady
fareham
must
give
me
the
order
i
am
no
servant
of
madame
kirkland
alone
in
the
garden
the
sisters
embraced
again
lady
fareham
with
a
fretful
tearfulness
as
of
one
whose
over
strung
nerves
were
on
the
verge
of
hysteria
there
is
something
that
preys
upon
your
spirits
dearest
angela
said
interrogatively
something
a
hundred
things
i
am
at
cross
purposes
with
life
but
i
should
have
been
worse
had
you
been
obstinate
and
still
refused
this
gentleman
why
should
that
affect
you
hyacinth
asked
her
sister
with
a
sudden
coldness
chi
lo
sa
one
has
fancies
but
my
dearest
sister
has
been
wise
in
good
time
and
you
will
be
the
happiest
wife
in
england
for
i
believe
your
puritan
is
a
saintly
person
the
very
opposite
of
our
court
sparks
who
are
the
most
incorrigible
villains
ah
sweet
if
you
heard
the
stories
lewin
tells
me
even
of
that
young
rochester
scarce
out
of
his
teens
and
the
duke
not
a
jot
better
than
the
king
and
with
so
much
less
grace
in
his
iniquity
well
you
will
be
married
at
the
chapel
royal
and
spend
your
wedding
night
at
fareham
house
we
will
have
a
great
supper
his
majesty
will
come
of
course
he
owes
us
that
much
civility
hyacinth
if
you
would
make
me
happy
let
me
be
married
in
our
dear
mother
oratory
by
your
chaplain
sure
dearest
you
know
i
have
never
taken
kindly
to
court
splendours
have
you
not
why
you
shone
and
sparkled
like
a
star
that
last
night
you
were
ever
at
whitehall
henri
sitting
close
beside
you
was
the
night
he
took
ill
of
a
fever
was
it
a
fever
i
have
wondered
sometimes
whether
there
was
not
a
mystery
of
attempted
murder
behind
that
long
sickness
murder
a
deadly
duel
with
a
man
who
hated
him
is
not
that
an
attempt
at
murder
on
the
part
of
him
who
deliberately
provokes
the
quarrel
well
it
is
past
and
he
is
gone
for
all
the
colour
of
the
world
i
live
in
there
might
never
have
been
any
such
person
as
henri
de
malfort
her
airy
laugh
ended
in
a
sob
which
she
tried
to
stifle
but
could
not
hyacinth
hyacinth
why
will
you
persist
in
being
miserable
when
you
have
so
little
cause
for
sadness
have
i
not
cause
am
i
not
growing
old
and
robbed
of
the
only
friend
who
brought
gaiety
into
my
life
who
understood
my
thoughts
and
valued
me
a
traitor
i
know
like
the
rest
of
them
they
are
all
traitors
but
he
would
have
been
true
had
i
been
kinder
and
trusted
him
hyacinth
you
are
mad
would
you
have
had
him
more
your
friend
he
was
too
near
as
it
was
every
thought
you
gave
him
was
an
offence
against
your
husband
would
you
have
sunk
as
low
as
those
shameless
women
the
king
admires
sunk
low
why
those
women
are
on
a
pinnacle
of
fame
courted
flattered
poetised
painted
they
will
be
famous
for
centuries
after
you
and
i
are
forgotten
there
is
no
such
thing
as
shame
nowadays
except
that
it
is
shameful
to
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
i
have
wasted
my
life
angela
there
was
not
a
woman
at
the
louvre
who
had
my
complexion
nor
one
who
could
walk
a
coranto
with
more
grace
yet
i
have
consented
to
be
a
nobody
at
two
courts
and
now
i
am
growing
old
and
my
poor
painted
face
shocks
me
when
i
chance
on
my
reflection
by
daylight
and
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
nothing
your
husband
sister
sister
do
not
mock
me
you
know
how
much
fareham
is
to
me
we
were
chosen
for
each
other
and
fancied
we
were
in
love
for
the
first
few
years
while
he
was
so
often
called
away
from
me
that
his
coming
back
made
a
festival
and
renewed
affection
he
came
crimson
from
battles
and
sieges
and
i
was
proud
of
him
and
called
him
my
hero
but
after
the
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
our
passion
cooled
and
he
grew
too
much
the
and
when
he
recovered
of
the
contagion
he
had
recovered
of
any
he
ever
had
for
me
ah
sister
you
say
these
things
without
thinking
them
his
lordship
needs
but
some
sign
of
affection
on
your
part
to
be
as
fond
a
husband
as
ever
he
was
you
can
answer
for
him
i
warrant
and
there
are
other
claims
upon
your
love
your
children
henriette
who
is
nearly
as
tall
as
i
am
and
thinks
herself
handsomer
and
cleverer
than
ever
i
was
george
who
is
a
lump
of
selfishness
and
cares
more
for
his
ponies
and
peregrines
than
for
father
and
mother
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
except
fine
houses
and
carriages
and
to
show
my
fading
beauty
dressed
in
the
latest
mode
at
twilight
in
the
ring
and
to
startle
people
from
the
observation
of
my
wrinkles
by
the
boldness
of
my
patches
i
was
the
first
to
wear
a
coach
and
horses
across
my
forehead
in
london
at
least
they
had
these
follies
in
paris
three
years
ago
indeed
dearest
and
thou
wilt
let
me
arrange
thy
wedding
after
my
own
fancy
wilt
thou
not
ma
tr√®s
ch√®re
you
forget
denzil
hatred
of
finery
but
the
wedding
is
the
bride
festival
the
bridegroom
hardly
counts
nay
love
you
need
fear
no
immodest
fooling
when
you
bid
good
night
to
the
company
nor
shall
there
be
any
scuffling
for
garters
at
the
door
of
your
chamber
there
was
none
of
that
antique
nonsense
when
lady
sandwich
married
her
daughter
all
vulgar
fashions
of
coarse
old
oliver
day
have
gone
to
the
ragbag
of
english
customs
we
were
so
coarse
a
nation
till
we
learnt
manners
in
exile
let
me
have
my
own
way
dearest
it
will
amuse
me
and
wean
me
from
melancholic
fancies
then
indeed
love
thou
shalt
have
thy
way
in
all
particulars
after
this
lady
fareham
was
in
haste
to
return
to
the
house
in
order
to
choose
the
wedding
gown
and
here
in
the
panelled
parlour
they
found
the
two
gentlemen
with
the
dust
of
the
road
and
the
warmth
of
the
noonday
sun
upon
them
newly
returned
from
aylesbury
where
they
had
ridden
in
the
freshness
of
the
early
morning
to
choose
a
team
of
at
the
fair
and
who
were
more
disconcerted
than
gratified
at
finding
the
usurped
by
lewin
madame
hortense
and
an
array
of
finery
that
made
the
room
look
like
a
stall
in
the
exchange
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
one
yet
there
were
no
signs
of
dinner
sir
john
and
sir
denzil
were
both
sharp
set
after
their
ride
and
were
looking
by
no
means
kindly
on
lewin
and
her
wares
when
hyacinth
and
angela
appeared
upon
the
scene
nothing
could
happen
luckier
said
lady
fareham
when
she
had
saluted
denzil
and
embraced
her
father
with
pish
sir
how
you
smell
of
clover
and
grass
i
vow
you
have
smothered
my
mantua
with
dust
father
and
sweetheart
were
called
upon
to
assist
in
choosing
the
wedding
gown
a
somewhat
empty
compliment
on
the
part
of
lady
fareham
since
she
would
not
hear
of
the
simple
canary
brocade
which
denzil
selected
and
which
lewin
protested
was
only
good
enough
to
make
his
lady
a
or
of
the
pale
grey
atlas
which
her
father
considered
suitable
since
indeed
she
would
have
nothing
but
a
white
satin
powdered
with
silver
fleurs
de
luces
which
she
remarked
would
have
become
the
grande
mademoiselle
had
she
but
obtained
her
permission
to
cast
herself
away
on
lauzun
dear
sister
can
you
consider
a
fabric
fit
for
a
bourbon
princess
a
becoming
gown
for
me
remonstrated
angela
yes
child
white
and
silver
will
better
become
thee
than
poor
louise
who
has
no
more
complexion
left
than
i
have
she
was
in
her
heyday
when
she
held
the
bastille
and
when
she
and
beaufort
were
two
of
the
most
popular
people
in
paris
she
has
made
herself
a
since
then
that
is
settled
lewin
with
a
nod
to
the
milliner
the
silver
fleurs
de
luces
for
the
wedding
mantua
and
now
be
quick
with
your
samples
all
angela
remonstrances
were
as
vain
as
they
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
acquaintance
with
lewin
the
excitement
of
discussing
and
selecting
the
finery
she
loved
affected
lady
spirits
like
a
draught
of
saumur
she
was
generous
by
nature
extravagant
by
long
habit
sure
it
would
be
a
hard
thing
if
i
could
not
give
you
your
wedding
clothes
when
you
are
marrying
the
man
i
chose
for
you
she
protested
the
farradine
by
all
means
lewin
is
the
very
shade
for
my
sister
fair
skin
indeed
denzil
nodding
at
him
as
he
stood
watching
them
with
that
hopelessly
bewildered
air
of
a
man
in
a
shop
i
have
been
your
best
friend
from
the
beginning
and
but
for
me
you
might
never
have
won
your
sweetheart
to
listen
to
you
mazarine
hoods
are
as
ancient
as
the
pyramids
lewin
show
us
something
newer
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
the
two
coaches
left
the
manor
gate
hyacinth
had
been
in
no
haste
to
return
to
the
abbey
there
was
nobody
there
who
wanted
her
she
protested
and
there
would
be
a
moon
after
nine
and
she
had
servants
enough
to
take
care
of
her
on
the
road
so
lewin
and
her
ladyship
woman
were
entertained
in
the
room
where
reuben
held
forth
upon
the
splendour
that
had
prevailed
in
his
master
house
before
the
troubles
and
where
the
ate
and
drank
all
she
could
get
and
dozed
and
yawned
through
the
old
reminiscences
the
afternoon
was
spent
more
pleasantly
by
the
quality
who
sat
about
in
the
sunny
garden
or
sauntered
by
the
fish
pond
and
fed
the
carp
and
took
a
dish
of
the
indian
drink
which
the
sisters
loved
in
the
pergola
at
the
end
of
the
grass
walk
hyacinth
now
affected
a
passion
for
the
country
and
quoted
the
late
cowley
in
praise
of
rusticity
oh
how
delicious
is
this
woodland
valley
she
cried
let
me
careless
and
unthoughtful
lying
hear
the
soft
winds
above
me
plying
with
all
their
wanton
boughs
dispute
poor
cowley
he
might
well
love
the
country
for
he
was
shamefully
treated
in
town
a
devoted
servant
to
bankrupt
royalty
for
all
the
best
years
of
his
life
and
fobbed
off
with
a
compliment
when
the
king
came
into
power
ah
me
is
an
ill
world
we
live
in
and
london
is
the
most
hateful
spot
in
it
she
concluded
with
a
sigh
and
yet
you
will
have
me
married
nowhere
else
sister
oh
for
a
wedding
or
a
christening
one
must
have
a
crowd
of
fine
people
it
would
go
about
that
lady
fareham
was
quite
out
of
fashion
if
i
were
content
to
see
only
ploughmen
and
and
a
petty
gentleman
or
two
with
their
wives
at
my
sister
marriage
london
is
the
only
decent
place
after
paris
to
live
in
but
the
country
is
a
peacefuller
place
in
which
to
die
a
sigh
emphasised
the
sentence
and
angela
scrutinised
her
sister
face
with
increased
concern
dear
love
i
fear
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
and
that
you
are
seriously
indisposed
she
said
earnestly
if
i
am
i
do
not
know
it
but
when
one
is
weary
of
living
there
is
only
one
sensible
thing
left
to
do
if
providence
will
but
be
kind
and
help
one
to
do
it
i
am
not
for
dagger
or
poison
or
for
a
plunge
in
deep
water
but
to
fade
away
in
a
gentle
disease
a
quiet
ebbing
of
the
vital
stream
is
the
luckiest
thing
that
can
befall
one
who
is
tired
of
life
alarmed
at
hearing
her
sister
talk
in
this
melancholy
strain
and
still
more
alarmed
by
the
change
in
her
looks
sunken
cheeks
hectic
flush
eyes
angela
entreated
lady
fareham
to
stay
at
the
manor
and
be
nursed
and
cared
for
oh
i
know
your
skill
in
nursing
and
your
power
over
a
sick
person
hyacinth
interjected
scornfully
and
then
in
the
next
moment
apologised
for
the
little
spurt
of
retrospective
jealousy
stay
with
us
love
and
let
us
make
you
happier
than
you
are
at
chilton
pleaded
angela
but
hyacinth
who
had
been
protesting
that
nobody
wanted
her
now
declared
that
she
could
not
leave
home
and
recited
a
list
of
duties
social
and
domestic
i
shall
not
have
half
an
hour
to
spare
until
i
go
to
london
next
week
to
prepare
for
the
wedding
she
said
the
date
had
been
fixed
while
they
sat
at
dinner
sir
john
and
his
elder
daughter
settling
the
day
while
denzil
assented
with
radiant
smiles
and
angela
sat
by
in
pale
silence
submissive
to
the
will
of
others
they
were
to
be
married
on
a
thursday
july
and
it
was
now
the
end
of
june
little
more
than
a
fortnight
interval
in
which
to
meditate
upon
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
lewin
promised
the
white
and
silver
mantua
and
as
many
of
the
new
clothes
as
a
supernatural
address
industry
and
obligingness
could
produce
within
the
time
hyacinth
grew
more
lively
after
supper
and
parted
from
her
father
and
sister
in
excellent
spirits
but
her
haggard
face
haunted
angela
in
troubled
dreams
all
that
night
and
she
thought
of
her
with
anxiety
during
the
next
few
days
and
most
of
all
upon
one
long
sultry
day
the
of
july
which
was
the
third
day
she
had
spent
in
unbroken
solitude
since
her
father
and
denzil
had
ridden
away
in
the
dim
early
morning
while
the
pastures
were
veiled
in
summer
haze
on
the
first
stage
of
a
journey
to
london
hoping
with
a
long
rest
between
noon
and
evening
to
ride
miles
before
night
they
were
to
consult
with
a
learned
london
lawyer
and
to
execute
the
marriage
settlement
sir
john
vastly
anxious
about
this
business
in
his
ignorance
of
law
and
distrust
of
lawyers
they
were
to
stay
in
london
only
long
enough
to
transact
their
business
and
would
then
return
to
the
manor
but
as
they
were
to
ride
their
own
horses
all
the
way
and
as
lawyers
are
notoriously
slow
angela
had
been
told
not
to
expect
them
till
the
fourth
evening
after
their
departure
in
her
lonely
rambles
that
long
summer
day
with
her
spaniel
ganymede
and
her
father
favourite
pointer
for
her
only
companions
angela
thoughts
dwelt
ever
on
the
past
of
the
future
even
that
so
near
future
of
her
marriage
she
thought
hardly
at
all
that
future
had
been
disposed
of
by
others
her
fate
had
been
settled
for
her
and
she
was
told
that
by
her
submission
she
would
make
those
she
loved
happy
her
father
would
have
the
son
he
longed
for
and
would
be
sure
of
her
faithful
devotion
till
the
end
of
his
days
or
of
hers
should
untimely
death
intervene
hyacinth
foolish
jealousy
would
be
dispelled
by
the
act
which
gave
her
sister
honour
into
a
husband
custody
and
for
him
that
presumptuous
lover
who
had
taken
so
little
pains
to
hide
his
wicked
passion
if
in
any
audacious
hour
he
had
dared
to
believe
her
guilty
of
reciprocating
his
love
that
insolent
suspicion
would
be
answered
at
once
and
for
ever
by
her
marriage
with
denzil
denzil
who
was
junior
by
fifteen
years
his
superior
in
every
advantage
of
person
as
she
told
herself
with
a
bitter
smile
for
even
while
she
thought
of
that
superiority
the
statuesque
regularity
of
feature
the
clear
colouring
of
a
complexion
warmed
with
the
glow
of
health
the
deep
blue
of
large
eyes
the
light
free
carriage
of
one
who
had
led
an
active
country
life
even
while
she
thought
of
denzil
another
face
and
figure
flashed
upon
her
memory
rugged
and
dark
the
forehead
deeper
lined
than
years
justified
the
proud
eye
made
sombre
by
the
shadow
of
the
projecting
brow
the
cheek
sunken
the
shoulders
bent
as
if
under
the
burden
of
melancholy
thoughts
o
god
this
was
the
face
she
loved
the
only
face
that
had
ever
touched
the
springs
of
joy
and
pain
it
was
nearly
half
a
year
since
she
had
seen
him
their
meetings
in
the
future
need
be
of
the
rarest
she
knew
that
denzil
regarded
him
with
a
distrust
which
made
friendship
out
of
the
question
and
it
would
be
her
duty
to
keep
as
far
aloof
from
that
old
time
as
possible
family
meetings
there
must
be
considering
the
short
distance
between
chilton
and
the
manor
feastings
and
junketings
in
company
once
or
twice
in
the
summer
lest
it
should
be
thought
sir
john
and
his
lordship
were
ill
friends
but
angela
knew
that
in
any
such
social
gathering
sitting
at
the
overloaded
board
amid
the
steam
of
rich
viands
and
the
noise
of
many
voices
she
and
fareham
would
be
as
far
apart
as
if
the
indian
ocean
rolled
between
them
once
and
very
soon
they
must
meet
face
to
face
and
he
would
take
her
hand
in
greeting
and
would
kiss
her
on
the
lips
as
she
stood
before
him
in
her
wedding
finery
that
splendour
of
white
and
silver
which
would
provoke
him
to
scornful
wonder
at
her
trivial
pleasure
in
sumptuous
clothes
thus
once
they
must
meet
her
heart
thrilled
at
the
thought
he
had
so
often
shunned
her
taking
such
obvious
trouble
to
keep
his
distance
but
he
could
hardly
absent
himself
from
her
wedding
the
scandal
would
be
too
great
well
she
had
accepted
her
fate
and
this
dull
aching
misery
must
be
lived
through
somehow
and
neither
her
father
nor
denzil
must
ever
have
occasion
to
suspect
her
unhappiness
oh
gracious
mary
mother
of
god
help
and
sustain
me
in
my
sorrow
guard
and
deliver
me
from
sinful
thoughts
what
are
my
fanciful
griefs
to
thy
great
sorrows
which
thou
didst
endure
with
holy
patience
subdue
and
bend
me
to
obedience
and
humility
let
me
be
an
affectionate
daughter
a
dutiful
wife
a
friend
and
comforter
to
my
poor
neighbours
so
and
with
many
such
prayers
she
struggled
against
the
dominion
of
evil
kneeling
meekly
in
the
leafy
stillness
of
that
deep
beechwood
where
no
human
eye
beheld
her
devotions
so
in
the
long
solitude
of
the
summer
day
she
held
commune
with
heaven
and
fought
against
that
memory
of
past
happiness
that
looking
back
to
the
joys
and
emotions
of
those
placid
hours
at
chilton
abbey
before
the
faintest
apprehension
of
evil
had
shadowed
her
friendship
with
fareham
not
to
look
back
not
to
remember
and
regret
that
was
the
struggle
in
which
the
intense
abstraction
of
the
believer
lifting
the
mind
to
heaven
alone
could
help
her
long
and
fervent
were
her
prayers
in
that
woodland
sanctuary
where
she
made
her
pious
retreat
nor
was
her
sister
forgotten
in
those
prayers
which
included
much
earnest
supplication
for
the
welfare
here
and
hereafter
of
that
lighter
soul
for
whom
she
had
ever
felt
a
protecting
and
almost
maternal
love
years
counted
for
very
little
in
the
relations
between
these
sisters
the
day
wore
to
its
close
the
most
solemn
day
in
angela
life
since
that
which
she
had
spent
in
the
reverend
mother
kneeling
in
the
faint
yellow
glow
of
the
tall
in
a
room
from
which
daylight
was
excluded
she
remembered
the
detachment
of
her
mind
from
all
earthly
interests
as
she
knelt
beside
that
and
how
easily
her
thoughts
had
mounted
heavenward
while
now
her
love
clung
to
this
sinful
earth
how
had
she
changed
for
the
worse
how
was
she
sunk
from
the
holy
aspirations
of
that
time
chapter
xxv
high
stakes
angela
had
eaten
her
lonely
supper
and
was
sitting
at
her
embroidery
frame
between
nine
and
ten
while
the
sounds
of
bolts
and
bars
in
the
hall
and
corridors
and
old
reuben
voice
hectoring
the
maids
told
her
that
the
servants
were
closing
the
house
before
going
to
bed
reuben
would
be
coming
to
her
presently
no
doubt
to
remind
her
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
wanting
to
carry
her
candle
to
her
chamber
and
as
it
were
to
see
her
safely
disposed
of
before
he
went
to
his
garret
she
meant
on
this
occasion
to
resist
his
friendly
tyranny
having
so
little
inclination
for
sleep
and
hoping
to
find
peace
of
mind
and
distraction
in
this
elaborate
embroidery
of
gold
thread
and
silks
which
was
destined
to
adorn
her
father
person
on
the
facings
of
a
doublet
suddenly
as
she
bent
over
the
candle
to
scrutinize
the
shading
of
her
silks
the
hollow
sound
of
hoofs
broke
upon
the
silence
and
in
a
minute
afterwards
a
bell
rang
loudly
who
could
it
be
at
such
an
hour
her
father
no
doubt
no
one
else
he
had
hurried
his
business
through
and
returned
a
day
earlier
than
he
had
hoped
or
could
it
be
that
he
had
fallen
sick
in
london
and
denzil
had
come
to
tell
her
ill
news
or
was
it
a
messenger
from
her
sister
she
had
time
to
contemplate
several
evil
contingencies
while
she
stood
in
the
hall
watching
reuben
withdraw
various
bolts
and
bars
the
door
swung
back
at
last
and
she
saw
a
man
in
boots
and
slouched
hat
standing
on
the
threshold
while
in
the
moonlight
behind
him
she
could
distinguish
a
mounted
groom
holding
the
bridle
of
a
led
horse
as
well
as
the
horse
from
which
the
visitor
had
just
dismounted
the
face
that
looked
at
her
from
the
doorway
was
the
face
which
had
haunted
her
with
cruel
persistency
through
that
long
day
chaining
her
thoughts
to
earth
fareham
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
few
moments
deadly
pale
while
she
was
collecting
her
senses
trying
to
understand
this
most
presence
why
was
he
here
ah
no
doubt
a
messenger
of
evil
oh
sir
my
sister
is
ill
she
cried
i
read
sorrow
in
your
face
seriously
ill
dangerously
speak
my
lord
for
pity
sake
yes
she
is
not
dead
no
no
but
very
ill
oh
i
feared
i
feared
when
i
saw
her
that
there
was
something
amiss
has
she
sent
you
to
fetch
me
yes
you
are
wanted
reuben
i
must
set
out
this
instant
order
the
coach
to
be
got
ready
and
betty
must
go
with
me
you
will
need
no
coach
angela
nor
is
there
time
to
spare
for
any
such
creeping
conveyance
i
have
brought
zephyr
you
remember
how
you
loved
him
he
is
swift
and
gentle
as
the
wind
after
which
we
named
him
sure
of
foot
easy
to
ride
the
roads
are
good
after
yesterday
rain
and
the
moon
will
last
us
most
of
our
way
we
shall
be
at
chilton
in
two
hours
put
on
your
coat
and
hat
indeed
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
do
you
mean
that
she
may
die
before
i
can
reach
her
i
know
not
stamping
his
foot
impatiently
fate
holds
the
keys
but
you
had
best
waste
no
time
on
questions
his
manner
was
one
of
command
and
he
seemed
to
apprehend
no
possibility
of
hesitation
on
her
part
reuben
ran
to
his
pantry
and
came
back
with
a
tankard
of
wine
which
he
offered
to
the
visitor
with
tremulous
respect
almost
ready
to
kneel
our
best
burgundy
my
lord
your
lordship
must
be
dry
after
your
long
ride
and
if
your
lordship
would
care
to
sup
there
is
good
picking
on
last
monday
chine
and
a
capon
from
madam
supper
scarce
touched
with
the
nothing
i
thank
you
friend
there
is
no
time
for
gluttony
reuben
pressing
the
tankard
upon
him
he
drank
some
wine
with
an
automatic
air
and
still
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
angela
pallid
countenance
waiting
her
decision
are
you
coming
he
asked
does
she
want
me
has
she
asked
for
me
oh
for
god
sake
my
lord
tell
me
more
is
she
dangerously
ill
have
the
doctors
given
her
over
no
but
she
is
in
a
bad
way
and
you
you
you
are
wanted
will
you
come
ay
or
no
yes
it
is
my
duty
to
go
to
her
but
when
my
father
and
denzil
come
back
reuben
must
be
able
to
tell
them
why
i
went
and
the
nature
of
my
sister
illness
were
it
not
so
serious
that
there
is
no
time
for
hesitation
it
would
ill
become
me
to
leave
this
house
in
my
absence
he
gave
his
head
a
curious
jerk
at
denzil
name
as
if
he
had
been
stung
yes
i
will
explain
i
can
make
all
clear
to
this
gentleman
here
while
you
put
on
your
cloak
bring
the
black
to
the
door
he
called
to
his
man
will
not
your
lordship
bait
your
horses
before
you
start
reuben
asked
deferentially
no
time
fellow
there
is
no
time
how
often
must
i
tell
you
so
retorted
fareham
reuben
village
breeding
had
given
him
an
exaggerated
respect
for
aristocracy
he
had
grown
up
in
the
midst
of
small
country
gentlemen
rural
squires
among
whom
the
man
with
three
thousand
a
year
in
land
was
a
magnate
and
there
had
never
been
more
than
one
nobleman
resident
within
a
day
ride
of
the
manor
moat
to
reuben
therefore
a
peer
was
like
a
god
and
he
would
have
no
more
questioned
lord
fareham
will
than
a
disciple
of
hobbes
would
have
imputed
injustice
to
kings
angela
returned
in
a
few
minutes
having
changed
her
silken
gown
for
a
neat
cloth
and
hood
she
carried
nothing
with
her
being
assured
that
her
sister
wardrobe
would
be
at
her
disposal
and
having
no
mind
to
spend
a
minute
more
in
preparation
than
was
absolutely
necessary
brief
as
her
toilet
was
she
had
time
to
consider
lord
countenance
and
manner
the
cold
distance
of
his
address
and
to
scorn
herself
for
having
thought
of
him
in
her
reveries
that
day
as
loving
her
always
and
till
death
it
was
far
better
so
the
abyss
that
parted
them
could
not
yawn
too
wide
she
put
a
stern
restraint
upon
herself
so
that
there
should
be
nothing
hysterical
in
her
manner
lest
her
fears
about
her
sister
health
should
be
mistaken
for
agitation
at
his
presence
she
stood
beside
the
horse
straight
and
firm
with
her
hand
on
the
pommel
and
sprang
lightly
into
the
saddle
as
fareham
strong
arm
lifted
her
yet
she
could
but
notice
that
his
hand
shook
as
he
gave
her
the
bridle
and
arranged
the
cloth
petticoat
over
her
foot
not
a
word
was
spoken
on
either
side
as
they
rode
out
at
the
gate
and
through
the
village
of
nicholas
beautiful
in
the
moonlight
such
low
crumbling
walls
and
deeply
sloping
roofs
of
cottages
squatting
in
a
tangle
of
garden
and
orchard
such
curious
outlines
of
old
brick
gables
in
the
better
class
houses
of
miller
butcher
and
general
dealer
orchards
and
gardens
and
farm
buildings
with
every
variety
of
thatch
and
eaves
huddled
together
in
picturesque
confusion
large
spaces
everywhere
pond
and
village
green
and
common
and
copse
beyond
a
peaceful
prosperous
settlement
which
had
passed
unharmed
through
the
ordeal
of
the
civil
war
safe
in
its
rural
seclusion
not
a
word
was
spoken
even
when
the
village
was
left
behind
and
they
were
riding
on
a
lonely
road
in
so
brilliant
a
moonlight
that
angela
could
see
every
line
in
her
companion
brooding
face
why
was
he
so
gloomy
and
so
unkind
in
an
hour
when
his
sympathy
should
naturally
have
been
given
to
her
was
he
consumed
with
sorrow
for
his
wife
indisposition
and
did
anxiety
make
him
silent
or
was
he
angry
with
himself
for
not
being
as
deeply
distressed
as
a
husband
ought
to
be
at
a
wife
peril
she
knew
too
well
how
he
and
hyacinth
had
been
growing
further
apart
day
by
day
till
the
only
link
between
husband
and
wife
seemed
to
be
a
decent
courtesy
and
subservience
to
the
world
opinion
she
recalled
that
other
occasion
when
they
two
had
made
a
solitary
journey
together
and
in
as
gloomy
a
silence
that
night
of
the
great
fire
when
he
had
flung
off
his
doublet
and
taken
the
sculls
out
of
her
hands
and
rowed
steadily
and
fast
with
his
eyes
downcast
leaving
her
to
steer
the
boat
as
she
would
or
trusting
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
for
a
clear
course
he
had
seemed
to
hate
her
that
night
just
as
he
seemed
to
hate
her
now
as
they
rode
mile
after
mile
side
by
side
the
groom
following
near
now
at
a
fast
trot
now
galloping
along
a
stretch
of
waste
grass
that
bordered
the
highway
now
breathing
their
horses
in
a
walk
in
one
of
those
intervals
he
asked
her
if
she
were
tired
no
no
i
have
no
power
to
feel
anything
but
anxiety
if
you
would
only
be
kinder
and
tell
me
more
about
my
sister
i
fear
you
consider
her
in
danger
yes
she
is
in
danger
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
o
god
she
looked
so
ill
when
i
saw
her
last
and
she
talked
so
wildly
i
feared
she
was
in
a
bad
way
how
soon
shall
we
be
at
chilton
my
lord
my
lord
why
do
you
lord
me
i
can
find
no
other
name
we
seem
to
be
strangers
but
indeed
names
and
ceremonies
matter
nothing
when
the
mind
is
in
trouble
how
soon
shall
we
reach
the
abbey
fareham
in
an
hour
at
latest
angela
his
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
her
name
and
all
of
force
and
passion
that
could
be
breathed
into
a
single
word
was
in
his
utterance
she
flushed
at
the
sound
and
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
fear
but
his
countenance
might
have
been
so
cold
and
passionless
and
cruelly
resolute
looked
that
face
in
the
moonlight
i
have
a
fresh
horse
waiting
for
you
at
thame
he
said
i
will
not
have
you
wearied
by
riding
a
tired
horse
we
are
within
five
minutes
of
the
inn
will
you
rest
there
for
half
an
hour
and
take
some
refreshment
rest
when
my
sister
may
be
dying
not
a
moment
more
than
is
needed
to
change
horses
i
have
brought
queen
bess
another
of
your
favourites
was
she
who
taught
you
to
ride
she
will
know
your
voice
and
your
light
hand
upon
her
bridle
they
found
the
inn
wrapped
in
slumber
like
every
house
or
cottage
they
had
passed
but
a
lantern
shone
within
an
open
door
in
the
quadrangle
round
which
house
and
stables
were
built
one
of
the
fareham
grooms
was
there
with
an
ostler
to
wait
upon
him
and
three
horses
were
brought
out
of
their
stable
ready
saddled
as
the
travellers
rode
under
the
archway
into
the
yard
the
mare
was
excited
at
finding
herself
on
the
road
in
the
clear
cool
night
with
the
moonlight
in
her
eyes
and
was
gayer
than
fareham
liked
to
see
her
under
so
precious
a
load
but
angela
was
no
longer
the
novice
by
whose
side
he
had
ridden
nearly
two
years
before
she
handled
queen
bess
firmly
and
soon
settled
her
into
a
sharp
trot
and
kept
her
at
it
for
nearly
three
miles
the
hour
fareham
had
spoken
of
was
not
exceeded
by
many
minutes
when
chilton
abbey
came
in
sight
the
grey
stone
walls
pale
in
the
moonlight
all
things
the
long
park
wall
the
pillared
gates
the
open
spaces
of
the
park
the
depth
of
shadow
where
the
old
oaks
and
beeches
spread
wide
and
dark
had
a
look
of
unreality
which
contrasted
curiously
with
the
scene
as
she
had
last
beheld
it
in
all
its
daylight
verdure
and
homeliness
she
dropped
lightly
from
her
horse
so
soon
as
they
drew
rein
at
an
angle
of
the
long
irregular
house
where
there
was
a
door
half
hidden
under
ivy
by
which
lord
fareham
went
in
and
out
much
oftener
than
by
the
principal
entrance
it
opened
into
a
passage
that
led
straight
to
the
library
where
there
was
a
lamp
burning
angela
saw
the
light
in
the
window
as
they
rode
past
he
opened
the
door
which
had
been
left
on
the
latch
and
nodded
a
dismissal
to
the
groom
who
went
off
to
the
stables
leading
their
horses
all
was
dark
in
the
passage
dark
and
strangely
silent
but
this
wing
was
remote
from
the
chief
apartments
and
from
the
servants
offices
will
you
take
me
to
my
sister
at
once
angela
asked
stopping
on
the
threshold
of
the
library
when
fareham
had
opened
the
door
a
lamp
upon
the
tall
mantelpiece
feebly
lighted
the
long
low
room
gloomy
with
the
darkness
of
old
oak
wainscot
and
a
heavily
timbered
ceiling
there
were
two
flasks
of
wine
upon
a
silver
salver
and
provisions
for
a
supper
and
a
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
you
had
better
warm
yourself
after
your
night
ride
and
eat
and
drink
something
before
you
see
her
no
no
what
after
riding
as
fast
as
our
horses
could
carry
us
i
must
go
to
her
this
moment
can
you
find
me
a
candle
looking
about
her
hurriedly
as
she
spoke
but
indeed
it
is
no
matter
i
know
my
way
to
her
room
in
the
dark
and
there
will
be
light
enough
from
the
great
window
stop
he
cried
seizing
her
arm
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
stop
dragging
her
back
and
shutting
the
door
violently
your
sister
is
not
there
great
god
what
do
you
mean
you
told
me
your
wife
was
here
ill
dying
perhaps
i
told
you
a
lie
sweetheart
but
desperate
men
will
do
desperate
things
where
is
my
sister
is
she
dead
not
unless
the
nemesis
that
waits
on
woman
folly
has
been
swifter
of
foot
than
common
i
have
no
wife
angela
and
you
have
no
sister
that
you
will
ever
care
to
own
my
lady
fareham
has
crossed
the
narrow
sea
with
her
lover
henri
de
malfort
her
paramour
always
though
i
once
thought
him
yours
and
tried
to
kill
him
for
your
sake
a
runaway
wife
hyacinth
great
god
she
clasped
her
hands
before
her
face
in
an
agony
of
shame
and
despair
falling
upon
her
knees
in
sudden
her
head
drooping
until
her
brow
almost
touched
the
ground
and
then
after
but
a
few
minutes
of
this
deep
humiliation
she
started
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
anger
liar
villain
despicable
devilish
villain
this
is
a
lie
like
the
other
a
wicked
lie
your
wife
your
wife
a
wanton
my
sister
my
life
upon
it
she
is
in
london
in
your
house
busy
preparing
for
my
marriage
unlock
that
door
my
lord
let
me
go
this
instant
back
to
my
father
oh
that
i
could
be
so
mad
as
to
leave
his
protection
at
your
bidding
open
the
door
sir
i
command
you
she
seemed
to
gain
in
height
and
to
be
taller
than
he
had
thought
her
he
who
had
so
watched
her
and
whose
memory
held
every
line
of
that
slender
graceful
figure
she
stood
straight
as
an
arrow
looking
at
him
with
set
lips
and
flaming
eyes
too
angry
to
be
afraid
trembling
but
with
indignation
not
fear
of
him
nay
child
he
said
gravely
i
have
got
you
and
i
mean
to
keep
you
but
you
have
trusted
yourself
to
my
hospitality
and
you
are
safe
in
my
house
as
in
a
sanctuary
i
may
be
a
villain
but
i
am
not
a
ruffian
if
i
have
brought
you
here
by
a
trick
you
are
as
much
mistress
of
your
life
and
fate
under
this
roof
as
you
ever
were
in
your
father
house
i
have
but
one
thing
to
say
sir
let
me
out
of
this
hateful
house
what
then
would
you
walk
back
to
the
manor
moat
through
the
night
alone
i
would
crawl
there
on
my
hands
and
knees
if
i
could
not
walk
anything
to
get
away
from
you
oh
the
baseness
of
it
to
vilify
my
sister
for
your
own
base
purposes
intolerable
villain
mistress
we
will
soon
put
an
end
to
that
charge
lies
there
have
been
but
that
is
none
is
you
are
the
slanderer
there
he
took
a
letter
from
the
pocket
of
his
doublet
and
handed
it
to
her
then
he
took
the
lamp
from
the
mantelshelf
and
held
it
while
she
read
alas
it
was
her
sister
hand
she
knew
those
hurried
characters
too
well
the
letter
was
blotted
with
ink
and
smeared
as
with
tears
angela
tears
began
to
rain
upon
the
page
as
she
read
i
have
tried
to
be
a
good
woman
and
a
true
wife
to
you
tried
hard
for
these
many
years
knowing
all
the
time
that
you
had
left
off
loving
me
and
but
for
the
shame
of
it
would
have
cared
little
though
i
had
as
many
lovers
as
a
maid
of
honour
you
made
life
harder
for
me
in
this
year
last
past
by
your
passion
for
my
sister
which
mystery
of
yours
silent
and
secret
as
you
were
these
eyes
must
have
been
blind
not
to
discover
and
while
you
were
cold
in
manner
and
cruel
of
speech
slighting
me
ever
there
was
one
who
loved
and
praised
me
one
whose
value
i
knew
not
till
he
left
this
country
and
i
found
myself
desolate
without
him
he
has
come
back
he
too
has
found
that
i
was
the
other
half
of
his
mind
and
that
he
could
taste
no
pleasure
in
life
unshared
by
me
he
has
come
to
claim
one
who
ever
loved
him
and
denied
him
only
for
sake
virtue
poor
fool
that
i
was
to
count
that
a
woman
noblest
quality
why
of
all
attributes
it
is
that
the
world
least
values
virtue
when
the
starched
due
de
montausier
fawns
upon
louise
de
la
valli√®re
when
barbara
palmer
is
de
facto
queen
of
england
virtue
farewell
forget
me
fareham
as
i
shall
try
to
forget
you
i
shall
be
in
paris
perhaps
before
you
receive
this
letter
my
house
in
the
rue
de
touraine
is
ready
for
me
i
shall
dishonour
you
by
no
open
scandal
the
man
i
love
will
but
rank
as
the
friend
i
most
value
and
my
other
friends
will
ask
no
questions
so
long
as
you
are
silent
and
do
not
seek
to
disgrace
me
indeed
it
were
an
ill
thing
to
pursue
me
with
your
anger
the
more
so
as
i
am
weak
and
ailing
and
may
not
live
long
to
enjoy
my
happiness
you
have
given
me
so
little
that
you
should
in
common
justice
spare
me
your
hate
i
leave
you
your
children
whom
you
have
affected
to
love
better
than
i
and
who
have
shown
so
little
consideration
for
me
that
i
shall
not
miss
them
what
think
you
of
that
angela
for
the
letter
of
a
it
is
blotted
with
her
tears
she
wrote
in
sorrow
despairing
of
your
love
she
managed
to
exist
for
a
round
dozen
years
without
my
love
or
doubting
it
so
long
as
she
had
her
it
was
only
when
he
deserted
her
that
she
found
life
a
burden
and
now
she
has
crossed
the
rubicon
she
belongs
to
her
age
the
age
of
kings
mistresses
and
light
women
and
she
will
be
happy
i
dare
swear
as
they
are
it
is
not
an
age
of
tears
and
when
the
fair
louise
ran
away
to
her
convent
the
other
day
in
a
passion
of
penitence
be
sure
she
only
went
on
purpose
to
be
brought
back
again
but
now
sweet
say
have
i
lied
to
you
about
the
lady
who
was
once
my
wife
he
asked
pointing
to
the
letter
in
her
hand
and
who
is
my
sister
to
the
end
of
time
my
sister
in
eternity
in
purgatory
or
in
paradise
i
can
not
cast
her
off
though
you
may
i
will
set
out
for
paris
and
bring
her
home
if
i
can
to
the
manor
she
need
trouble
you
no
more
my
husband
and
i
can
shelter
and
pity
her
your
husband
he
will
be
my
husband
a
fortnight
hence
never
never
while
i
live
to
fling
my
body
between
you
at
the
altar
his
blood
or
mine
should
choke
your
marriage
vows
angela
angela
be
reasonable
i
have
brought
you
out
of
that
trap
i
have
cut
the
net
in
which
they
had
caught
you
my
love
you
are
free
and
i
am
free
and
you
belong
to
me
you
never
loved
denzil
warner
never
would
love
him
were
you
to
live
with
him
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
is
ice
and
you
are
fire
dearest
you
belong
to
me
he
who
made
us
both
created
us
to
be
happy
together
there
are
strings
in
our
hearts
that
harmonize
as
concords
in
music
do
we
are
miserable
apart
both
of
us
we
waste
and
fade
and
torture
ourselves
in
absence
but
only
to
breathe
the
same
air
to
sit
silent
in
the
same
room
is
to
be
happy
let
me
go
she
cried
looking
at
him
with
wild
eyes
leaning
against
the
locked
door
her
hands
clutching
at
the
latch
seeming
neither
to
hear
nor
heed
his
impassioned
address
though
every
word
had
sunk
deep
enough
to
remain
in
her
memory
for
ever
let
me
go
you
are
a
dishonourable
villain
i
came
to
london
alone
to
your
deserted
house
i
was
not
afraid
of
death
or
the
plague
then
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
now
open
this
door
and
let
me
go
never
to
see
your
wicked
face
again
angela
canst
thou
so
play
fast
and
loose
with
happiness
look
at
me
kneeling
at
her
feet
trying
to
take
her
hands
from
their
hold
on
the
latch
our
fate
is
in
our
power
the
day
is
near
dawning
and
at
the
stroke
of
five
my
coach
will
be
at
the
door
to
take
us
to
bristol
where
the
ship
lies
that
shall
carry
us
to
new
england
to
a
new
world
and
liberty
and
to
the
sweet
simple
life
that
will
please
my
dear
love
better
than
all
the
garish
pleasures
of
a
licentious
court
ah
dearest
i
know
thy
mind
and
heart
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
i
know
i
can
make
thee
happy
in
that
fair
new
world
where
we
shall
begin
life
again
free
from
all
old
burdens
and
where
if
thou
wilt
my
motherless
children
can
join
us
and
make
one
loving
household
my
henriette
adores
you
and
it
were
christian
charity
to
rescue
her
and
her
brother
from
charles
stuart
england
and
to
bring
them
up
to
an
honest
life
in
a
country
where
men
are
free
to
worship
god
as
he
moves
them
love
you
can
not
deny
me
so
sweet
a
life
waits
for
us
and
you
have
but
to
lay
that
dear
hand
in
mine
and
give
consent
oh
god
she
murmured
i
thought
this
man
held
me
in
honour
and
esteem
do
i
not
honour
you
ah
love
what
can
a
man
do
more
than
offer
his
life
to
her
he
loves
and
if
he
is
another
woman
husband
that
tie
is
broken
i
deny
it
but
if
it
were
you
have
been
my
sister
husband
and
you
could
be
nothing
to
me
but
my
brother
you
have
made
sisterly
affection
impossible
and
so
my
lord
we
must
be
strangers
and
as
you
are
a
gentleman
i
bid
you
open
this
door
and
let
me
make
my
way
to
some
more
peaceful
shelter
than
your
house
angela
he
tried
to
draw
her
to
his
breast
but
she
held
him
off
with
outstretched
arm
and
even
in
the
tumult
of
his
passion
the
knowledge
of
her
helplessness
and
his
natural
shame
at
his
own
treachery
kept
him
in
check
angela
call
me
villain
if
you
will
but
give
me
a
fair
hearing
dearest
the
joy
or
sorrow
of
two
lives
lies
in
your
choice
if
you
will
trust
me
and
go
with
me
i
swear
i
will
make
you
happy
if
you
are
stubborn
to
refuse
well
sweetheart
you
will
but
send
a
man
to
the
devil
who
is
not
wholly
bad
and
who
with
you
for
his
guardian
angel
might
find
the
way
to
heaven
and
begin
the
journey
by
a
sin
these
lips
dare
not
name
oh
fareham
she
said
growing
suddenly
calm
and
grave
and
with
something
of
that
tender
maternal
manner
with
which
she
had
soothed
and
controlled
him
while
he
had
but
half
his
wits
and
when
she
feared
he
might
be
lying
on
his
i
would
rather
believe
you
a
madman
than
a
villain
and
indeed
all
that
you
have
done
is
the
work
of
a
madman
who
follows
his
own
wild
fancy
without
power
to
reason
on
what
he
does
surely
sir
you
know
me
too
well
to
believe
that
i
would
let
love
were
it
the
blindest
most
absorbing
passion
woman
ever
felt
lead
me
into
sin
so
base
as
that
you
would
urge
the
vilest
wanton
at
whitehall
would
shrink
from
stealing
a
husband
there
would
be
no
theft
your
sister
flings
me
to
you
as
a
dog
drops
the
bone
he
has
picked
dry
she
had
me
when
i
was
young
and
a
soldier
with
some
reflected
glory
about
me
from
the
hero
i
followed
and
rich
and
happy
she
leaves
me
old
and
haggard
without
aim
or
hope
save
to
win
her
i
worship
shall
i
tell
you
when
i
began
to
love
you
my
angel
no
no
i
will
listen
to
no
more
raving
thank
god
there
is
the
daylight
as
the
cold
wan
dawn
flickered
across
the
room
will
you
let
me
beat
my
hands
against
this
door
till
they
bleed
thou
shalt
not
harm
the
loveliest
hands
on
earth
seizing
them
both
in
his
own
ah
sweet
i
began
to
love
thee
before
ever
i
rose
from
that
bed
of
horror
where
i
had
been
left
to
perish
i
loved
thee
in
my
unreason
and
my
love
strengthened
with
each
hour
of
returning
sense
our
journey
i
so
weak
and
sick
and
helpless
was
a
ride
through
paradise
i
would
have
had
it
last
a
year
would
have
suffered
sickness
and
pain
aching
limbs
and
parched
lips
only
to
feel
the
light
touch
of
this
dear
hand
upon
my
brow
sleep
and
waking
only
to
look
up
as
i
awoke
and
see
those
sweet
eyes
looking
down
at
me
ah
dearest
my
heart
arose
from
among
the
dead
and
came
out
of
the
tomb
of
all
human
affections
to
greet
thee
till
i
knew
you
i
knew
not
the
meaning
of
love
and
if
you
are
stubborn
and
will
not
come
with
me
to
that
new
world
where
we
may
be
so
happy
why
then
i
must
go
down
to
my
grave
a
despairing
wretch
that
never
knew
a
woman
love
my
sister
your
wife
never
loved
me
her
heart
that
which
she
calls
heart
was
ever
and
not
mine
she
gave
me
to
know
as
much
by
a
hundred
signs
and
tokens
which
read
plain
enough
now
looking
back
but
which
i
scarce
heeded
at
the
time
i
believed
her
chaste
and
she
was
civil
and
i
was
satisfied
i
tell
you
angela
this
heart
never
beat
for
woman
till
i
knew
you
ah
love
be
not
stone
make
not
our
affinity
an
obstacle
the
roman
church
will
ever
grant
dispensation
for
a
union
of
affinities
where
there
is
cause
for
indulgence
the
church
would
have
had
philip
married
to
his
wife
sister
elizabeth
the
church
holds
the
bond
of
marriage
indissoluble
angela
answered
you
are
married
to
my
sister
and
while
she
lives
you
can
have
no
other
wife
her
brow
was
stern
her
courage
unfaltering
but
physical
force
was
failing
her
she
leant
against
the
door
for
support
and
she
no
longer
struggled
to
withdraw
her
hands
from
that
strong
grasp
which
held
them
she
fought
against
the
faintness
that
was
stealing
over
her
senses
but
her
heavy
eyelids
were
beginning
to
droop
and
there
was
a
sound
like
rushing
water
in
her
ears
angela
angela
pleaded
the
tender
voice
do
you
forget
that
afternoon
at
the
play
and
how
you
wept
over
bellario
fidelity
the
fond
who
followed
him
she
loved
risked
name
and
virtue
counted
not
the
cost
in
that
large
simplicity
of
love
which
gives
all
it
has
to
give
unquestioning
remember
bellario
bellario
had
no
thought
that
was
not
virtue
she
answered
faintly
and
he
took
that
fainter
tone
for
a
yielding
will
she
would
not
have
left
philaster
if
he
had
been
alone
in
the
wilderness
miserable
for
want
of
her
love
her
white
lips
moved
dumbly
her
eyelids
sank
and
her
head
fell
back
upon
his
shoulder
as
he
started
up
from
his
knees
to
support
her
sinking
figure
she
was
in
his
arms
unconscious
the
image
of
death
he
kissed
her
on
the
brow
my
soul
i
will
owe
nothing
to
thy
helplessness
he
whispered
thy
free
will
shall
decide
whether
i
live
or
die
another
sound
had
mingled
with
the
rushing
waters
as
her
senses
left
her
the
sound
of
knocking
at
a
distant
door
it
grew
louder
and
louder
momently
indicating
a
passionate
impatience
in
those
who
knocked
the
sound
came
from
the
principal
door
and
there
was
a
long
corridor
between
that
door
and
fareham
room
he
stood
listening
undecided
and
then
he
laid
the
unconscious
form
gently
on
the
thick
persian
carpet
knowing
that
for
recovery
the
fainting
girl
could
not
lie
too
low
he
cast
one
agitated
glance
at
the
white
face
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
and
then
went
quickly
to
the
hall
as
he
came
near
the
knocking
began
again
with
greater
vehemence
and
a
voice
which
he
knew
for
sir
john
called
open
the
door
in
the
king
name
or
we
will
break
it
open
there
was
a
pause
those
without
evidently
waiting
for
the
result
of
that
last
and
loudest
summons
fareham
heard
the
hoofs
of
restless
horses
trampling
the
gravel
drive
the
jingle
of
bit
and
chain
and
the
click
of
steel
scabbards
sir
john
had
not
come
alone
so
soon
so
devilish
soon
muttered
fareham
and
then
as
the
knocking
was
renewed
he
turned
and
left
the
hall
without
a
word
of
answer
to
those
outside
and
hastened
back
to
the
room
where
he
had
left
angela
his
brow
was
fixed
in
a
resolute
frown
every
nerve
was
braced
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
he
had
the
house
to
himself
and
was
thus
master
of
the
situation
so
long
as
he
could
keep
his
pursuers
on
the
outside
the
upper
servants
half
a
dozen
had
been
packed
off
to
london
under
convoy
of
manningtree
and
hubbock
the
under
servants
rank
and
file
from
housemaids
to
turnspits
slept
in
a
huge
barrack
adjoining
the
stables
built
in
elizabeth
reign
to
accommodate
the
lower
grade
of
a
nobleman
household
these
would
not
come
into
the
house
to
light
fires
and
sweep
rooms
till
six
at
the
earliest
and
it
was
not
yet
four
lord
fareham
therefore
had
to
fear
no
interruption
from
his
own
people
there
was
broad
daylight
in
the
house
now
yet
he
looked
about
for
a
candle
found
one
on
a
in
a
tall
silver
candlestick
and
stopped
to
light
it
before
he
raised
the
lifeless
figure
from
the
floor
and
lifted
it
into
the
easiest
position
for
carrying
the
head
lying
on
his
shoulder
then
holding
the
slender
waist
firmly
circled
by
his
left
arm
he
took
the
candlestick
in
his
right
hand
and
went
out
of
the
room
with
his
burden
along
a
passage
leading
to
a
staircase
which
he
ascended
carrying
that
tall
slim
form
as
if
it
had
been
a
up
flight
after
flight
to
the
muniment
room
in
the
roof
from
that
point
his
journey
and
the
management
of
that
unconscious
form
and
to
dispose
safely
of
the
lighted
candle
became
more
difficult
and
occupied
a
considerable
time
during
which
interval
the
impatience
of
an
enraged
father
and
a
betrothed
husband
outside
the
hall
door
increased
with
every
minute
of
delay
and
one
of
their
mounted
followers
of
whom
they
had
several
was
despatched
to
ride
at
a
to
the
village
of
chilton
and
rouse
the
constable
while
another
was
sent
to
oxford
for
a
magistrate
warrant
to
arrest
lord
fareham
on
the
charge
of
abduction
and
meanwhile
the
battering
upon
thick
oaken
panels
with
stout
and
heavy
and
the
calling
upon
those
within
were
repeated
with
unabated
vehemence
while
a
couple
of
horsemen
rode
round
the
house
to
examine
other
inlets
and
do
picket
duty
the
constable
and
his
underling
were
on
the
ground
before
that
stubborn
citadel
answered
the
reiterated
summons
but
at
last
there
came
the
sound
of
bolts
withdrawn
an
iron
bar
dropped
from
its
socket
with
a
clang
that
echoed
long
and
loud
in
the
empty
hall
the
door
opened
and
fareham
appeared
on
the
threshold
in
the
cold
raw
daylight
facing
his
besiegers
with
a
determined
insolence
thou
most
infernal
villain
cried
sir
john
rushing
into
the
hall
followed
closely
by
denzil
and
one
of
the
men
what
have
you
done
with
my
daughter
which
daughter
does
your
honour
seek
if
it
be
she
whom
you
gave
me
for
a
wife
she
has
broken
the
bond
and
is
across
the
sea
with
her
paramour
you
lie
reprobate
your
wife
had
doubtless
business
relating
to
her
french
estate
which
called
her
to
paris
my
daughters
are
honest
women
unless
by
your
villainy
one
who
should
have
been
sacred
as
your
sister
by
affinity
should
bear
a
blighted
name
give
me
back
my
daughter
villain
the
girl
you
lured
from
her
home
by
the
foulest
deceit
you
can
not
see
the
lady
gentlemen
even
though
you
threaten
me
with
your
weapons
pointing
with
a
sardonic
smile
to
their
drawn
swords
and
me
with
your
followers
the
lady
is
gone
i
am
alone
in
the
house
to
submit
to
any
affront
your
superior
force
may
put
upon
me
our
superiority
can
at
least
search
your
house
said
denzil
sir
john
you
had
best
take
one
way
and
i
another
i
doubt
i
know
every
room
and
passage
in
the
abbey
and
your
yeoman
manners
offer
a
handsome
return
for
the
hospitality
which
made
you
acquainted
with
my
house
said
fareham
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
he
followed
denzil
leaving
sir
john
to
grope
alone
the
house
had
been
deserted
but
for
a
few
days
yet
the
corridors
and
rooms
had
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
places
long
shut
from
sunshine
and
summer
breezes
while
the
chilling
hour
the
grey
ghostly
light
added
something
phantasmal
and
unnatural
to
the
scene
denzil
entered
room
after
room
below
stairs
and
above
explored
the
the
the
long
low
in
the
roof
built
in
elizabeth
reign
when
a
wing
had
been
added
to
the
abbey
and
of
late
used
only
for
lumber
fareham
followed
him
close
stalking
behind
him
in
sullen
silence
with
an
unalterable
gloom
upon
his
face
which
betrayed
no
sudden
apprehensions
no
triumph
or
defeat
he
followed
like
doom
stood
quietly
on
one
side
as
denzil
opened
a
door
waited
on
the
threshold
while
the
searcher
made
his
inspection
always
with
the
same
iron
visage
offering
no
opposition
to
the
entrance
of
this
or
that
chamber
only
following
and
watching
silent
intent
till
at
last
fairly
worn
out
by
blank
disappointment
denzil
turned
upon
him
in
a
sudden
fury
what
have
you
done
with
her
he
cried
desperately
i
will
stake
my
life
she
has
not
left
this
house
and
by
him
who
made
us
you
shall
not
leave
it
living
unless
i
find
her
he
glanced
downward
at
the
naked
sword
he
had
carried
throughout
his
search
fareham
was
in
the
scabbard
and
he
answered
that
glance
with
an
insulting
smile
you
think
i
have
murdered
her
perhaps
he
said
well
i
would
rather
see
her
dead
than
yours
so
far
i
am
in
capacity
a
murderer
they
met
sir
john
in
lady
fareham
when
denzil
had
gone
over
the
whole
house
trusting
nothing
to
the
father
scrutiny
he
has
stabbed
her
and
dropped
her
murdered
body
down
a
well
cried
the
knight
half
distraught
he
can
not
have
spirited
her
away
otherwise
look
at
him
denzil
look
at
that
haggard
wretch
i
have
called
my
son
he
has
the
assassin
aspect
something
it
might
be
the
room
in
which
they
were
standing
brought
back
to
angela
betrothed
the
memory
of
that
christmas
night
when
aunt
and
niece
had
been
missing
and
when
he
denzil
had
burst
into
this
room
where
fareham
was
seated
at
chess
who
at
the
first
mention
of
name
started
up
white
with
horror
to
join
in
the
search
it
was
he
who
found
her
then
it
was
he
who
had
hidden
her
now
and
in
the
same
remote
and
secret
spot
fool
that
i
was
not
to
remember
sooner
cried
denzil
i
know
where
to
find
her
follow
me
sir
john
andrew
calling
to
the
servant
who
waited
in
the
hall
follow
us
close
he
rushed
along
a
passage
ran
upstairs
faster
than
old
age
were
it
ever
so
eager
could
follow
but
fareham
was
nearly
as
fast
nearly
but
not
quite
able
to
overtake
him
for
he
was
older
heavier
and
more
broken
by
the
fever
of
that
night
work
than
his
rival
denzil
was
some
paces
in
advance
when
he
reached
the
muniment
room
he
found
the
opening
in
the
wainscot
and
the
steep
stair
built
into
the
chimney
half
way
to
the
bottom
there
was
a
gap
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
and
a
drop
of
six
feet
so
that
a
stranger
in
hurried
pursuit
would
be
likely
to
come
to
grief
at
this
point
and
make
time
for
his
quarry
to
escape
by
the
door
that
opened
on
the
garden
memory
or
wits
sharpened
by
anxiety
enabled
denzil
to
avoid
this
trap
and
he
was
at
the
door
of
the
priest
hole
before
fareham
began
the
descent
yes
she
was
there
kneeling
in
a
corner
a
candle
burning
dimly
on
a
stone
shelf
above
her
head
she
was
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
her
head
bent
her
face
hidden
when
the
door
opened
and
she
looked
up
and
saw
her
betrothed
husband
denzil
how
did
you
find
me
here
i
should
be
a
poor
slave
if
i
had
not
found
you
remembering
the
past
great
god
how
pale
you
are
come
love
you
are
safe
your
father
is
here
angela
thou
that
art
so
soon
to
be
my
wife
face
to
face
here
before
we
leave
this
accursed
pit
tell
me
that
you
did
not
go
with
that
villain
except
for
the
sake
of
your
sick
sister
that
you
were
the
victim
of
a
heartless
lie
not
a
party
to
a
trick
invented
to
blind
your
father
and
me
i
doubt
i
have
not
all
my
senses
yet
she
said
putting
her
hand
to
her
head
i
was
told
my
sister
wanted
me
and
i
came
where
is
lord
fareham
the
terror
in
her
countenance
as
she
asked
that
question
froze
denzil
ah
he
had
known
it
all
along
that
was
the
man
she
loved
was
she
his
victim
and
a
willing
victim
he
felt
as
if
a
great
gulf
had
opened
between
him
and
his
betrothed
and
that
all
his
hopes
had
withered
fareham
was
at
his
elbow
in
the
next
moment
well
you
have
found
her
he
said
but
you
shall
not
have
her
save
by
force
of
arms
she
is
in
my
custody
and
i
will
keep
her
or
die
for
her
if
i
am
outnumbered
execrable
wretch
would
you
attempt
to
detain
her
by
violence
come
madam
said
denzil
turning
coldly
to
angela
there
is
a
door
on
those
stairs
which
will
let
you
out
into
the
air
the
door
will
not
open
at
your
bidding
fareham
said
fiercely
he
snatched
angela
up
in
his
arms
before
the
other
could
prevent
him
and
carried
her
triumphantly
to
the
first
which
was
considerably
below
that
treacherous
gap
between
stair
and
stair
he
had
the
key
of
the
garden
door
in
his
pocket
unlocked
it
and
was
in
the
open
air
with
his
burden
before
denzil
could
overtake
him
he
found
himself
caught
in
a
trap
he
had
his
and
armed
postillions
waiting
close
by
and
thought
he
had
but
to
leap
into
it
with
his
prey
and
spirit
her
off
towards
bristol
but
between
the
coach
and
the
door
one
of
sir
john
pickets
was
standing
who
the
moment
the
door
opened
whistled
his
loudest
and
brought
constable
and
man
and
another
armed
servant
running
round
an
angle
of
the
house
and
so
crossing
the
very
path
to
the
coach
fire
upon
him
if
he
tries
to
pass
you
cried
denzil
what
and
shoot
the
lady
you
have
professed
to
love
exclaimed
fareham
drawing
himself
up
and
standing
firm
as
a
rock
with
angela
motionless
in
his
arms
he
dropped
her
to
her
feet
but
held
her
against
his
left
shoulder
with
an
iron
hold
while
he
drew
his
sword
and
made
a
rush
for
the
coach
denzil
sprang
into
his
path
sword
in
hand
and
their
blades
crossed
with
a
shrill
clash
and
rattle
of
steel
they
fought
like
demons
fareham
holding
angela
behind

swaying
from

in

with
a
demoniac
swiftness
and
suppleness
his
thick
dark
brows
knitted
over
eyes
that
flamed
with
a
fiercer
fire
than
flashed
from
steel
meeting
steel
a
shriek
of
horror
from
angela
marked
the
climax
as
denzil
fell
with
fareham
sword
between
his
ribs
there
had
been
little
of
dilettante
science
or
graceful
play
of
wrist
in
this
encounter
the
men
had
rushed
at
each
other
savagely
like
beasts
in
a
circus
and
whatever
of
science
had
guided
fareham
more
practised
hand
had
been
employed
automatically
the
spirit
of
the
combatants
was
wild
and
fierce
as
the
rage
that
moves
rival
stags
fighting
for
a
mate
with
bent
heads
and
tramping
hoofs
and
clash
of
locked
antlers
reverberating
through
the
forest

no

to
exult
over
his
prostrate
foe
sir
john

his

constable
and
underlings
surrounded
him
and
he
was
handcuffed
and
hauled
off
to
the
coach
that
was
to
have
carried
him
to
a
paradise
before
any
one
had
looked
to

discovered
whether
that
violent
thrust

chapter

in
the
court
of
king
bench
the
summer
and
autumn
had
gone
by
an
eventful
season
for
with
it
had
vanished
from
the
stage
of
politics
one
who
had
played
so
dignified
and
serious
a
part
there
southampton
was
dead
clarendon
disgraced
and
in
exile
the
nestor
and
the
ulysses
of
the
stuart
epic
had
melted
from
the
scene
down
those
stairs
by
which
he
had
descended
on
his
way
to
so
many
a
splendid
festival
himself
a
statelier
figure
than
kings
or
princes
the
chancellor
had
gone
to
banishment
and
oblivion
the
lady
had
looked
for
the
last
time
a
laughing
jezebel
from
a
palace
window
exultant
at
her
enemy
fall
and
along
the
river
that
had
carried
such
tragic
destinies
eastward
to
be
sealed
in
blood
edward
hyde
earl
of
clarendon
had
drifted
quietly
out
of
the
history
he
had
helped
to
make
the
ballast
of
that
grave
intellect
was
flung
overboard
so
that
the
ship
of
fools
might
drift
the
faster
but
in
westminster
hall
upon
this
windy
november
morning
nobody
thought
of
clarendon
the
business
of
the
day
was
interesting
enough
to
obliterate
all
considerations
of
yesterday
the
young
barristers
who
were
learning
their
trade
by
listening
to
their
betters
had
been
shivering
on
their
benches
in
the
common
pleas
since
nine
in
that
chilly
corner
where
every
blast
from
the
north
or
swept
over
the
low
wooden
partition
that
enclosed
the
court
or
cut
through
the
chinks
in
the
panelling
the
students
and
juniors
were
in
their
usual
places
sitting
at
the
feet
of
their
favourite
judge
but
the
idlers
who
came
for
amusement
to
saunter
about
the
hall
haggle
for
books
with
the
dealers
along
the
south
wall
or
flirt
with
the
milliners
who
kept
stalls
for
bands
and
other
legal
finery
on
the
opposite
side
or
to
listen
on
tiptoe
with
an
ear
above
the
panelled
enclosure
to
the
quips
and
cranks
or
fierce
rhetoric
of
a
famous
advocate
these
gravitated
with
one
accord
towards
the
corner
of
the
hall
where
in
the
court
of
king
bench
richard
revel
baron
fareham
of
fareham
hants
was
to
be
tried
by
a
buckinghamshire
jury
for
abduction
with
fraud
malice
and
violence
and
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder
the
rank
of
the
offender
being
high
and
the
indictment
known
to
involve
tragic
details
of
family
history
there
had
been
much
talk
of
the
cause
which
was
on
the
paper
for
and
as
a
natural
consequence
besides
the
habitual
loungers
and
saunterers
gossips
and
there
was
a
considerable
sprinkling
of
persons
of
quality
who
perfumed
the
not
too
agreeable
atmosphere
with
pulvilio
and
florentine
iris
powder
and
the
rustle
of
whose
silks
and
brocades
was
audible
all
over
the
hall
not
often
did
such
gowns
sweep
the
dust
brought
in
by
plebeian
feet
nor
such
venetian
point
collars
rub
shoulders
with
the
frowsy
norwich
drugget
worn
by
hireling
perjurers
or
starveling
clerks
the
modish
world
had
come
down
upon
the
great
norman
hall
like
a
flock
of
pigeons
sleek
iridescent
all
fuss
and
flutter
and
among
these
unaccustomed
visitors
there
was
prodigious
impatience
for
the
trial
to
begin
and
a
struggle
for
good
places
that
brought
into
full
play
the
primitive
brutality
which
underlies
the
politeness
of
the
civillest
people
lady
sarah
tewkesbury
had
risen
betimes
and
in
her
anxiety
to
secure
a
good
place
had
come
out
in
her
last
night
head
which
somewhat
damaged
edifice
of
ringlets
and
roman
pearls
was
now
visible
above
the
wooden
partition
of
the
king
bench
to
the
eyes
of
the
commonalty
in
the
hall
below
her
ladyship
being
accommodated
with
a
seat
among
the
lawyers
one
of
these
was
a
young
man
in
a
shabby
gown
and
rumpled
wig
but
with
a
fair
complexion
and
tolerable
features
a
stranger
to
that
court
and
better
known
at
hicks
hall
and
among
city
litigators
with
whom
he
had
already
a
certain
repute
for
keen
wits
and
a
plausible
tongue
about
the
youngest
advocate
at
the
english
bar
and
by
some
people
said
to
be
no
barrister
at
all
but
to
have
put
on
wig
and
gown
two
years
ago
at
kingston
assizes
and
called
himself
to
the
bar
and
stayed
there
by
sheer
audacity
this
young
gentleman
jeffreys
by
name
having
deserted
the
city
and
possible
briefs
in
order
to
hear
the
fareham
trial
was
inclined
to
resent
being
ousted
by
an
obsequious
official
to
make
room
for
lady
sarah
faith
one
would
suppose
i
was
her
ladyship
footman
and
had
been
keeping
her
seat
for
her
he
grumbled
as
he
reluctantly
rose
at
the
whispered
request
and
edged
himself
sulkily
off
to
a
corner
where
he
found
just
it
was
a
very
hard
seat
which
jeffreys
had
vacated
and
her
ladyship
after
sitting
there
over
two
hours
nodding
asleep
a
good
part
of
the
time
began
to
feel
internal
sinkings
and
flutterings
which
presaged
what
she
called
a
swound
and
necessitated
recourse
to
a
crystal
flask
of
strong
waters
which
she
had
prudently
brought
in
her
muff
other
of
lady
particular
friends
were
expected
sir
ralph
masaroon
lady
lucretia
topham
and
more
of
the
same
kidney
and
even
the
volatile
rochester
had
deigned
to
express
an
interest
in
the
case
the
man
was
mistaken
in
his
m√©tier
he
had
told
lady
sarah
when
the
scandal
was
discussed
in
her
the
of
seducer
was
not
within
his
means
any
one
could
see
he
was
in
love
with
the
pale
by
the
manner
in
which
he
scowled
at
her
but
it
is
not
every
woman
who
can
be
subjugated
by
gloom
and
sullenness
though
some
of
like
us
tragical
my
method
has
been
to
laugh
away
resistance
as
my
wife
will
acknowledge
who
was
the
cruellest
she
i
ever
tackled
and
had
baffled
all
her
other
servants
indeed
she
must
have
been
in
butler
eye
when
he
wrote
old
pyg
what
d
call
him
malion
that
cut
his
mistress
out
of
stone
had
not
so
hard
a
hearted
one
even
lady
rochester
will
admit
i
conquered
without
heroics
upon
which
her
ladyship
late
mistress
mallett
a
beauty
and
a
fortune
smiled
assent
with
all
the
complacency
of
a
bride
to
see
a
man
tried
for
an
attempted
abduction
is
a
sight
worth
a
year
income
pursued
rochester
i
would
travel
a
hundred
miles
to
behold
that
rare
monster
who
has
failed
in
his
pursuit
of
one
of
your
obliging
sex
do
you
think
us
all
so
easily
won
asked
lady
sarah
piqued
dear
lady
i
can
but
judge
by
experience
if
obdurate
to
others
you
have
still
been
kind
to
me
lady
sarah
had
nearly
emptied
her
flask
of
muscadine
before
masaroon
elbowed
his
way
to
a
seat
beside
her
from
which
he
audaciously
dislodged
a
acquaintance
an
elderly
lawyer
upon
whom
fortune
had
not
smiled
with
a
condescending
civility
that
was
more
uncivil
than
absolute
rudeness
we
share
a
bottle
in
hell
after
the
trial
mon
ami
he
said
and
on
seeing
lady
sarah
look
of
horror
he
hastened
to
explain
that
heaven
hell
and
purgatory
were
the
cant
names
of
three
taverns
which
drove
a
roaring
trade
in
strong
drinks
under
the
very
roof
of
the
hall
the
king
is
prosecuting
answered
sir
ralph
replying
to
a
question
from
lady
sarah
whose
inquiries
betrayed
that
dense
ignorance
of
legal
technicalities
common
even
to
accomplished
women
it
is
thought
the
lady
father
would
have
been
glad
for
the
matter
to
be
quashed
his
fugitive
daughter
being
restored
to
his
custody
albeit
with
a
damaged
character
and
her
elder
sister
having
run
away
from
her
husband
i
will
not
hear
you
slander
my
dearest
friend
protested
lady
sarah
lady
fareham
left
her
husband
and
with
good
cause
as
his
showed
she
did
not
run
away
from
him
nay
she
had
doubtless
the
assistance
of
a
she
would
scarce
foot
it
from
london
to
dover
and
now
she
is
leading
grand
train
in
paris
and
has
taken
almost
as
commanding
a
place
as
her
friend
madame
de
longueville
penitent
and
retired
from
service
hyacinth
under
all
her
appearance
of
silliness
is
a
remarkably
clever
woman
said
lady
sarah
sententiously
but
pray
sir
ralph
if
mistress
angela
father
has
good
reason
for
not
prosecuting
his
lover
indeed
i
ever
thought
her
an
underhand
hussy
why
does
not
sir
denzil
warner
who
i
hear
has
been
at
death
door
pursue
him
for
assault
and
battery
nay
is
so
still
madam
i
question
if
he
be
yet
out
of
danger
the
gentleman
is
a
kind
of
puritanical
quixote
and
has
persistently
refused
to
swear
an
information
against
fareham
whereby
i
doubt
the
case
will
fall
through
or
his
lordship
get
off
with
a
fine
of
a
thousand
or
two
we
have
no
longer
the
blessing
of
a
star
chamber
to
supply
state
needs
out
of
sinners
pockets
and
mitigate
general
taxation
but
his
majesty
judges
have
a
capacious
stomach
for
fines
and
his
majesty
has
no
objection
to
see
his
subjects
misdemeanours
transmuted
into
coin
and
now
the
business
of
the
day
began
the
panelled
enclosure
being
by
this
time
crowded
almost
to
suffocation
and
lord
fareham
was
brought
into
court
he
was
plainly
dressed
in
a
dark
grey
suit
and
looked
ten
years
older
than
when
lady
sarah
had
last
seen
him
on
his
wife
visiting
day
an
uninterested
member
of
that
modish
assembly
his
eyes
were
deeper
sunken
under
the
strongly
marked
brows
the
threads
of
in
his
thick
black
hair
were
more
conspicuous
he
carried
his
head
higher
than
he
had
been
accustomed
to
carry
it
and
the
broad
shoulders
were
no
longer
bent
in
the
stafford
stoop
the
spectators
could
see
that
he
had
braced
himself
for
the
ordeal
and
would
go
through
the
day
work
like
a
man
of
iron
proclamation
was
made
for
silence
and
for
information
if
any
person
could
give
any
concerning
the
misdemeanour
and
offence
whereof
the
defendant
stood
impeached
and
the
defendant
was
bid
to
look
to
his
challenges
and
the
jury
being
gentlemen
of
the
county
of
bucks
were
called
challenged
and
sworn
the
demand
for
silence
was
so
far
obeyed
that
there
followed
a
hush
within
the
enclosure
of
the
court
but
there
was
no
cessation
of
the
buzz
of
voices
and
the
tramp
of
footsteps
in
the
hall
which
mingled
sounds
seemed
like
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
human
ocean
as
heard
within
that
panelled
sanctuary
the
lawyers
took
snuff
shuffled
on
their
seats
nudged
each
other
and
whispered
now
and
then
during
the
reading
of
the
indictment
but
among
lady
fareham
friends
and
the
quality
in
general
there
was
a
breathless
silence
and
expectancy
and
lady
sarah
would
gladly
have
run
her
into
a
snuffy
old
serjeant
close
beside
her
who
must
needs
talk
behind
his
hand
to
his
pert
junior
to
her
ladyship
unaccustomed
ears
that
indictment
translated
literally
from
the
latin
original
sounded
terrible
as
an
impeachment
in
the
subterranean

of

in

most
select

council
in

on
horseback
were
elicited
and
the
story
of
the
ruse
by
which
angela
kirkland
had
been
beguiled
from
her
home
was
made
clear
to
the
comprehension
of
a
superior
but
rustic
jury
more
skilled
in
discriminating
the
points
of
a
horse
the
qualities
of
an
ox
or
the
capacity
of
a
hound
than
in
differentiating
truth
and
falsehood
in
a
story
of
sir
john
kirkland
was
the
next
witness
and
the
aspect
of
the
man
the
noble
grey
head
fine
features
and
soldierly
carriage
the
habit
the
fashion
of
an
age
not
long
past
but
almost
forgotten
enlisted
the
regard
and
compassion
of
jury
and
audience
let
me
perish
if
it
is
not
a
ghost
from
the
civil
wars
whispered
sir
ralph
to
lady
sarah
angela
might
well
be
romanesque
and
unlike
the
rest
of
us
with
such
a
father
a
spasm
of
pain
convulsed
fareham
face
for
a
moment
as
the
old
cavalier
stood
up
in
the
towering
above
the
court
in
that
elevated
position
and
after
being
sworn
took
one
swift
survey
of
the
bench
and
jury
and
then
fixed
his
angry
gaze
upon
the
defendant
and
scarcely
shifted
it
in
the
whole
course
of
his
examination
now
gentlemen
of
the
jury
said
the
we
shall
tell
you
what
happened
at
chilton
abbey
to
which
place
the
defendant
under
such
fraudulent
and
lying
pretences
as
you
have
heard
of
from
the
last
witness
conveyed
the
young
lady
sir
john
i
will
ask
you
to
acquaint
the
jury
as
fully
and
straightforwardly
as
you
can
with
the
circumstances
of
your
pursuit
and
the
defendant
reception
of
you
and
your
intended
sir
denzil
warner
whose
deposition
we
have
failed
to
obtain
but
who
could
relate
no
facts
which
are
not
equally
within
your
own
knowledge
my
words
shall
be
straight
and
plain
sir
to
denounce
that
unchristian
wretch
whom
until
this
miserable
business
i
trusted
as
if
he
had
been
my
son
i
came
to
my
house
accompanied
by
my
daughter
plighted
husband
within
an
hour
after
that
villain
conveyed
her
away
and
on
hearing
my
old
servant
story
was
quick
to
suspect
treachery
nor
was
sir
denzil
backward
in
his
fears
which
were
more
instantaneous
than
mine
and
we
waited
only
for
the
saddling
of
fresh
horses
and
rousing
a
couple
of
grooms
from
their
beds
fellows
that
i
could
trust
for
prudence
and
courage
before
we
mounted
again
following
in
that
wretch
track
we
heard
of
him
and
his
victim
at
the
inn
where
they
changed
horses
she
going
consentingly
believing
she
was
being
taken
in
this
haste
to
attend
a
dying
sister
and
on
arriving
at
the
defendant
house
what
was
your
reception
he
opposed
our
entrance
until
he
saw
that
we
should
batter
down
his
door
if
he
shut
us
out
longer
we
were
not
admitted
until
after
i
had
sent
one
of
my
servants
for
the
nearest
constable
and
before
we
had
gained
an
entrance
into
his
house
he
had
contrived
to
put
away
my
daughter
in
a
wretched
planned
for
the
concealment
of
romish
priests
or
other
recusants
and
malefactors
and
would
have
kept
her
there
i
believe
till
she
had
perished
in
that
foul
cavern
rather
than
restore
her
to
her
father
and
natural
guardian
that
is
false
and
you
know
it
cried
fareham
my
life
is
of
less
account
to
me
than
a
hair
of
her
head
i
hid
her
from
you
to
save
her
from
your
tyranny
and
the
hateful
marriage
to
which
you
would
have
compelled
her
liar
impudent
barbarous
liar
roared
the
old
knight
with
his
right
arm
raised
and
his
body
half
out
of
the
box
as
if
he
would
have
assaulted
the
defendant
sir
john
said
the
judge
i
would
be
very
loath
to
deal
otherwise
than
becomes
me
with
a
person
of
your
quality
but
indeed
this
is
not
so
handsome
and
we
must
desire
you
to
be
calm
when
i
remember
his
infamy
and
that
vile
assumption
of
my
passion
for
him
which
he
showed
in
every
word
and
act
of
that
miserable
scene
he
went
on
to
relate
the
searching
of
the
house
and
warner
happy
inspiration
by
which
angela
was
discovered
and
she
rescued
in
a
fainting
condition
he
described
the
defendant
audacious
attempt
to
convey
her
to
the
coach
which
stood
ready
for
her
abduction
and
his
violence
in
opposing
her
rescue
and
the
fight
which
had
resulted
in
warner
death
when
sir
john
story
was
finished
the
defendant
advocate
who
had
declined
to
question
the
old
butler
rose
to
this
more
important
witness
in
your
tracing
of
the
defendant
journey
between
your
house
and
chilton
you
heard
of
no
outcries
of
resistance
upon
your
daughter
side
no
sir
she
went
willingly
under
a
delusion
and
do
you
think
now
sir
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
with
some
knowledge
of
women
that
your
daughter
was
so
easily
hoodwinked
she
having
seen
her
sister
lady
fareham
so
shortly
before
in
good
health
and
spirits
lady
fareham
did
not
appear
in
good
health
when
she
was
last
at
the
manor
and
her
sister
was
already
uneasy
about
her
but
not
so
uneasy
as
to
believe
her
dying
and
that
it
was
needful
to
ride
to
her
in
the
do
you
not
think
sir
that
the
young
lady
who
was
so
quick
to
comply
with
his
lordship
summons
and
bustled
up
and
was
in
the
saddle
ten
minutes
after
he
entered
the
house
and
was
willing
to
got
without
her
own
woman
or
any
preparation
for
travel
had
a
strong
inclination
for
the
journey
and
a
great
kindness
for
the
gentleman
who
solicited
her
company
has
that
barbarous
wretch
set
you
on
to
slander
the
lady
whose
ruin
he
sought
sir
asked
the
knight
pallid
with
the
white
heat
of
indignation
nay
sir
john
i
am
no
slanderer
but
i
want
the
jury
to
understand
the
sentiments
and
passions
which
are
the
springs
of
action
here
and
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
case
they
are
hearing
is
a
love
story
and
they
can
only
come
at
the
truth
by
remembering
their
own
experience
as
lovers
the
deep
and
angry
tones
of
his
client
interrupted
the
counsellor
if
you
think
to
help
me
sir
by
traducing
the
lady
i
repudiate
your
advocacy
my
lord
you
are
not
allowed
to
give
evidence
or
to
interrupt
the
court
you
have
pleaded
not
guilty
and
it
is
my
duty
to
demonstrate
your
innocence
come
sir
john
do
you
not
know
that
his
lordship
unhappy
passion
for
his
was
shared
by
the
subject
of
it
and
that
she
for
a
long
time
opposed
all
your
efforts
to
bring
about
a
proper
alliance
for
her
solely
guided
and
influenced
by
this
secret
passion
i
know
no
such
thing
do
i
understand
then
that
from
the
time
of
your
first
proposals
she
was
willing
to
marry
sir
denzil
warner
she
was
not
willing
i
would
have
wagered
as
much
did
you
fathom
her
reason
for
declining
so
proper
an
alliance
i
did
not
trouble
myself
about
her
reasons
i
knew
that
time
would
wear
them
away
and
i
doubt
you
trusted
to
a
father
authority
no
sir
i
promised
my
daughter
that
i
would
not
force
her
inclinations
but
you
used
all
methods
of
persuasion
how
long
was
it
before
july
the
that
angela
consented
to
marry
sir
denzil
i
can
not
be
over
precise
upon
that
point
i
have
no
record
of
the
date
but
you
have
the
faculty
of
memory
sir
and
this
is
a
point
which
a
father
would
not
easily
forget
it
may
have
been
a
fortnight
before
and
until
that
time
the
lady
was
unwilling
yes
she
refused
positively
to
accept
the
match
you
urged
upon
her
she
refused
and
finally
consented
i
will
wager
with
marked
reluctance
no
sir
there
was
no
reluctance
she
came
to
me
of
her
own
accord
and
surprised
me
by
her
submission
that
will
do
sir
john
you
can
stand
down
i
shall
now
proceed
to
call
a
witness
who
will
convince
the
jury
of
my
client
innocence
upon
the
first
and
chief
count
in
the
indictment
abduction
with
fraud
and
violence
i
shall
tell
you
by
the
lips
of
my
witness
that
if
he
took
the
lady
away
from
her
home
she
being
of
full
age
she
went
freely
consenting
and
with
knowledge
of
his
purpose
lies
foul
lies
cried
the
old
cavalier
almost
strangled
with
passion
he
plucked
at
the
knot
of
his
cravat
trying
to
loosen
it
feeling
himself
threatened
with
apoplexy
call
mistress
angela
kirkland
said
the
serjeant
in
strong
steady
tones
that
contrasted
with
the
indignant
father
hoarse
and
gasping
utterance
the
business
becomes
every
moment
more
interesting
whispered
lady
sarah
will
he
make
that
sly
slut
own
her
misconduct
in
open
court
if
she
blush
at
her
slip
from
virtue
it
will
be
a
new
sensation
in
a
london
to
see
the
colour
of
shame
replied
sir
ralph
behind
his
perfumed
glove
but
i
warrant
she
carry
matters
with
a
high
hand
and
feel
herself
every
inch
a
heroine
angela
came
into
the
court
attended
by
her
who
remained
near
the
entrance
amid
the
crowd
of
lawyers
and
onlookers
while
her
mistress
quietly
followed
the
official
who
conducted
her
to
the
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
her
countenance
under
her
neat
black
hood
looked
scarcely
less
white
than
her
lawn
neckerchief
but
she
stood
erect
and
unfaltering
in
that
conspicuous
station
and
met
the
eyes
of
her
interrogator
with
an
untroubled
gaze
when
her
lips
had
touched
the
dirty
little
book
greasy
with
the
kisses
of
innumerable
perjurers
the
serjeant
began
to
question
her
in
a
tone
of
odious
familiarity
now
my
dear
young
lady
here
is
a
gentleman
liberty
and
perhaps
his
life
hanging
on
the
breath
of
those
pretty
lips
so
i
want
you
to
answer
a
few
plain
questions
with
as
plain
speech
as
you
can
command
remembering
that
you
are
to
tell
us
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
come
now
dear
miss
when
you
left
your
father
house
on
the
night
of
july
in
this
present
year
in
lord
fareham
company
did
you
go
with
him
of
your
own
free
will
and
with
a
knowledge
of
his
purpose
i
knew
that
he
loved
me
a
groan
from
sir
john
kirkland
was
hushed
down
by
an
usher
of
the
court
you
knew
that
he
loved
you
and
that
he
designed
to
carry
you
beyond
seas
yes
and
you
were
willing
to
leave
your
father
custody
and
go
with
the
defendant
as
his
paramour
there
was
a
pause
and
the
white
cheek
crimsoned
and
the
heavy
eyelids
fell
over
agonised
eyes
i
went
willingly
because
i
loved
him
and
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
passion
i
would
have
died
for
him
or
lived
for
him
it
mattered
not
which
and
she
has
lied
for
him
has
sworn
to
a
lie
and
that
to
her
own
dishonour
cried
sir
john
beside
himself
whereupon
he
was
sternly
bidden
to
keep
silence
there
was
no
intention
that
this
little
buckinghamshire
gentleman
should
be
indulged
to
the
injury
of
a
person
of
lord
fareham
wealth
and
consequence
the
favour
of
the
bench
obviously
leant
towards
the
defendant
fareham
deep
tones
startled
the
audience
in
truth
your
honour
the
young
lady
has
belied
herself
in
order
to
help
me
he
said
i
can
not
accept
acquittal
at
the
cost
of
her
good
name
your
lordship
has
pleaded
not
guilty
and
his
lordship
chivalry
would
revoke
that
plea
cried
the
counsel
this
is
most
irregular
i
must
beg
that
the
bench
do
order
the
defendant
to
keep
silence
the
witness
can
stand
down
angela
descended
from
the
falteringly
and
would
perhaps
have
fallen
but
for
her
father
strong
grasp
which
clutched
her
arm
as
she
reached
the
last
step
he
dragged
her
out
of
the
court
and
into
the
open
hall
wanton
he
hissed
in
her
ear
shameless
wanton
she
answered
nothing
but
stood
where
he
held
her
with
wild
eyes
looking
out
of
a
white
rigid
countenance
she
had
done
what
she
had
come
there
to
do
persuaded
by
fareham
attorney
who
had
waited
upon
her
at
her
lodgings
when
sir
john
was
out
of
the
way
she
had
made
her
attempt
to
save
the
man
she
loved
ignorant
of
the
extent
of
his
danger
exaggerating
the
potential
severity
of
his
punishment
in
the
illimitable
fear
of
a
woman
for
the
safety
of
the
being
she
loves
and
now
she
cared
nothing
what
became
of
her
cared
little
even
for
her
father
anger
or
distress
there
was
always
the
convent
last
refuge
of
sin
or
sorrow
which
meant
the
annihilation
of
the
individual
and
where
the
world
praise
or
blame
had
no
influence
her
woman
fussed
about
her
with
a
bottle
of
strong
essence
and
sir
john
dragged
rather
than
led
her
along
the
hall
to
the
great
door
where
the
coach
that
had
carried
her
from
his
london
lodgings
was
in
waiting
he
saw
her
seated
with
her
woman
beside
her
supporting
her
gave
the
coachman
his
orders
and
then
went
hastily
back
to
the
court
of
king
bench
the
court
was
rising
the
jury
without
leaving
their
seats
had
pronounced
the
defendant
guilty
of
a
misdemeanour
not
in
conveying
sir
john
kirkland
daughter
away
from
her
home
to
which
act
she
had
avowed
herself
a
consenting
party
but
in
detaining
her
in
his
house
with
violence
and
in
opposition
to
her
father
and
proper
guardian
the
lord
chief
justice
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
this
verdict
and
after
expatiating
with
pious
horror
upon
the
evil
consequences
of
an
ungovernable
passion
a
guilty
love
a
direct
inspiration
of
satan
sentenced
the
defendant
to
pay
a
fine
of
ten
thousand
pounds
upon
the
payment
of
which
sum
he
would
be
set
at
liberty
the
old
cavalier
heard
the
brief
sermon
and
the
sentence
which
seemed
to
him
of
all
punishments
the
most
futile
he
had
hoped
to
see
his
sent
to
the
plantations
for
life
had
been
angry
at
the
thought
that
he
would
escape
the
gallows
and
for
sole
penalty
the
seducer
was
sentenced
to
forfeit
less
than
a
year
income
how
corrupt
and
venal
was
a
bench
that
made
the
law
of
the
land
a
nullity
when
a
great
personage
was
the
he
flung
himself
in
the
defendant
way
as
he
left
the
court
and
struck
him
across
the
breast
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
an
unarmed
man
sir
john
is
that
your
chivalry
fareham
asked
quietly
a
crowd
was
round
them
and
swords
were
drawn
before
the
officer
could
interfere
there
were
friends
of
fareham
in
the
court
and
two
of
his
gentlemen
and
sir
john
who
was
alone
might
have
been
seriously
hurt
before
the
authorities
could
put
down
the
tumult
had
not
his
protected
him
sheath
your
swords
if
you
love
me
he
exclaimed
flinging
himself
in
front
of
sir
john
i
would
not
have
the
slightest
violence
offered
to
this
gentleman
and
i
would
kill
you
if
i
had
the
chance
cried
sir
john
that
is
the
difference
between
us
i
keep
no
measures
with
the
man
who
ruined
my
daughter
your
daughter
is
as
spotless
a
saint
as
the
day
she
left
her
convent
and
you
are
a
blatant
old
fool
to
traduce
her
said
fareham
exasperated
as
the
usher
led
him
away
his
detention
was
no
more
than
a
formality
and
as
he
had
been
previously
allowed
his
liberty
upon
bail
he
was
now
permitted
to
return
to
his
own
house
where
by
an
order
upon
his
banker
he
paid
the
fine
and
was
henceforward
a
free
man
the
first
use
he
made
of
his
freedom
was
to
rush
to
sir
john
lodgings
only
to
hear
that
the
cavalier
with
his
daughter
and
two
servants
had
left
half
an
hour
earlier
in
a
for
buckinghamshire
the
people
at
the
lodgings
did
not
know
which
road
they
had
taken
or
at
what
inn
they
were
to
lie
on
the
way
well
there
will
be
a
better
chance
of
seeing
her
at
the

watch

of

chapter
xxvii
bringers
of
sunshine
it
was
december
and
the
fields
and
pastures
were
white
in
the
tardy
dawn
with
the
frosty
mists
of
early
winter
and
sir
john
kirkland
was
busy
making
his
preparations
for
leaving
buckinghamshire
and
england
with
his
daughter
he
had
come
from
spain
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
hoping
to
spend
the
remnant
of
his
days
in
the
home
of
his
forefathers
and
to
lay
his
old
bones
in
the
family
vault
but
the
place
was
poisoned
to
him
for
evermore
he
told
angela
he
could
not
stay
where
he
and
his
had
been
held
in
highest
honour
to
have
his
daughter
pointed
at
by
every
grinning
lout
in
shoes
and
scorned
by
the
neighbouring
quality
he
only
waited
till
denzil
warner
should
be
pronounced
out
of
danger
and
on
the
to
recovery
before
he
crossed
the
channel
there
is
no
occasion
you
should
leave
buckinghamshire
sir
angela
argued
it
is
the
dearest
wish
of
my
heart
to
return
to
the
convent
at
louvain
and
finish
my
life
there
sheltered
from
the
world
contempt
what
having
failed
to
get
your
fancy
you
would
dedicate
yourself
to
god
he
cried
no
madam
i
am
still
your
father
though
you
have
disgraced
me
and
i
require
a
daughter
duty
from
you
oh
child
i
so
loved
you
was
so
proud
of
you
it
is
a
bitter
physic
you
have
given
me
to
drink
she
knelt
at
his
feet
and
kissed
his
sunburnt
hands
shrunken
with
age
i
will
do
whatever
you
desire
sir
i
wish
no
higher
privilege
than
to
wait
upon
you
but
when
you
weary
of
me
there
is
ever
the
convent
leave
that
for
your
libertine
sister
be
sure
she
will
finish
a
loose
life
by
a
conspicuous
piety
she
will
turn
saint
like
madame
de
longueville
sinners
are
the
stuff
of
which
modern
saints
are
made
and
women
love
extremes
to
pass
from
silk
and
luxury
to
matins
and
the
carmelite
woollen
habit
no
angela
there
must
be
no
convent
for
you
while
i
live
your
penance
must
be
to
suffer
the
company
of
a
petulant
disappointed
old
man
no
penance
sir
but
peace
and
contentment
so
i
am
but
forgiven
oh
you
are
forgiven
there
is
that
about
you
with
which
one
can
not
long
be
angry
a
creature
so
gentle
and
submissive
a
reed
that
bends
under
a
blow
let
us
not
think
of
the
past
you
were
a
fool
but
not
a
wanton
no
i
will
never
believe
that
a
generous
headstrong
fool
ready
with
thine
own
perjured
lips
to
blacken
thy
character
in
order
to
save
the
villain
who
did
his
best
to
ruin
thee
but
thou
art
pure
looking
down
at
her
with
a
severe
scrutiny
there
is
no
memory
of
guilt
in
those
eyes
we
will
go
away
together
and
live
peacefully
together
and
you
shall
still
be
the
staff
of
my
failing
steps
the
light
of
my
fading
eyes
the
comfort
of
my
ebbing
life
were
i
but
easy
in
my
mind
about
those
poor
forsaken
grandchildren
i
could
leave
england
cheerfully
enough
but
to
know
them
motherless
with
such
a
father
indeed
sir
i
believe
however
greatly
lord
fareham
may
have
erred
he
will
not
prove
a
neglectful
father
angela
said
her
voice
growing
low
and
tremulous
as
she
pronounced
that
fatal
name
you
will
vouch
for
him
no
doubt
a
licentious
villain
but
an
admirable
father
no
child
nature
does
not
deal
in
such
anomalies
the
children
are
alone
at
chilton
with
their
english
gouvernante
and
the
prim
frenchwoman
who
takes
infinite
pains
to
perfect
henriette
unlikeness
to
a
human
child
they
are
alone
and
their
father
is
hanging
about
the
court
at
court
lord
fareham
indeed
sir
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
indeed
madam
i
have
the
fact
on
good
authority
oh
sir
if
you
have
reason
to
think
those
dear
children
neglected
is
it
not
your
duty
to
protect
and
care
for
them
their
poor
mistaken
mother
has
abandoned
them
yes
to
play
the
great
lady
in
paris
where
when
i
went
in
quest
of
her
last
july
while
thou
wert
lying
sick
here
hoping
to
bring
back
a
penitent
i
was
received
with
a
triumphant
insolence
finding
her
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
flatterers
a
princess
in
little
with
all
the
airs
and
graces
and
ceremonies
and
hauteur
of
the
french
when
i
charged
her
with
being
malfort
mistress
and
bade
her
pack
her
traps
and
come
home
with
me
she
deafened
me
with
her
angry
volubility
i
to
slander
her
i
her
father
when
there
was
no
one
in
paris
from
the
place
royale
to
the
louvre
more
looked
up
to
but
when
i
questioned
my
old
friends
they
answered
with
enigmatical
smiles
and
assured
me
that
they
knew
nothing
against
my
daughter
character
worse
than
all
the
world
was
saying
about
some
of
the
highest
ladies
in
france
madame
to
wit
and
with
this
cold
comfort
i
must
needs
be
content
and
leave
her
in
her
splendid
infamy
father
be
sure
she
will
come
back
to
us
she
has
been
led
into
by
the
artfullest
of
villains
she
will
discover
the
emptiness
of
her
life
and
come
back
to
seek
the
solace
of
her
children
love
let
us
care
for
them
meanwhile
they
have
no
other
kindred
think
of
our
sweet
henriette
so
rich
so
beautiful
so
growing
from
child
to
woman
in
the
care
of
servants
who
may
spoil
and
pervert
her
even
by
their
very
fondness
it
is
a
bad
case
i
grant
but
i
can
stir
no
finger
where
that
man
is
concerned
i
can
hold
no
communication
with
that
scoundrel
but
your
lawyer
could
claim
custody
of
the
children
for
you
perhaps
i
think
not
angela
unless
there
was
a
criminal
neglect
of
their
bodies
the
law
takes
no
account
of
souls
angela
greatest
anxiety
now
that
denzil
recovery
was
assured
was
for
the
welfare
of
these
children
whom
she
fondly
loved
and
for
whom
she
would
have
gladly
played
a
mother
part
she
wrote
in
secret
to
her
sister
entreating
her
to
return
to
england
for
her
children
sake
and
to
devote
herself
to
them
in
retirement
at
chilton
leaving
the
scandal
of
her
elopement
to
be
forgotten
in
the
course
of
blameless
years
so
that
by
the
time
henriette
was
old
enough
to
enter
the
world
her
mother
would
have
recovered
the
esteem
of
worthy
people
as
well
as
the
respect
of
the
mob
lady
fareham
tardy
answer
was
not
encouraging
she
had
no
design
of
returning
to
a
house
in
which
she
had
never
been
properly
valued
and
she
admired
that
her
sister
should
talk
of
scandal
considering
that
the
scandal
of
her
own
intrigue
with
her
had
set
all
england
talking
and
had
been
openly
mentioned
in
the
london
and
oxford
gazettes
silence
about
other
people
affairs
would
best
become
a
young
miss
who
had
made
herself
so
notorious
as
for
the
children
lady
fareham
had
no
doubt
that
their
father
who
had
ever
lavished
more
affection
upon
them
than
he
bestowed
upon
his
wife
might
be
trusted
with
the
care
of
them
however
abominable
his
conduct
might
be
in
other
matters
but
in
any
case
her
ladyship
would
not
exchange
paris
for
london
where
she
had
been
slighted
and
neglected
at
court
as
well
as
at
home
the
letter
was
a
tissue
of
injustice
and
egotism
and
angela
gave
up
all
hope
of
influencing
her
sister
for
good
but
not
the
hope
of
being
useful
to
her
sister
children
now
as
the
short
winter
days
went
by
and
the
preparations
for
departure
were
making
she
grew
more
and
more
urgent
with
her
father
to
obtain
the
custody
of
his
grandchildren
and
carry
them
to
france
with
him
where
they
might
be
reared
and
educated
under
his
own
eye
montpelier
was
the
place
of
exile
he
had
chosen
a
place
renowned
alike
for
its
admirable
climate
and
educational
establishments
and
where
sir
john
had
spent
the
previous
winter
and
had
made
friends
it
was
to
montpelier
the
great
chancellor
had
retired
from
the
splendours
of
a
princely
mansion
but
just
completed
far
exceeding
his
own
original
intentions
in
splendour
as
the
palaces
of
men
are
apt
to
do
and
from
a
power
and
authority
second
only
to
that
of
kings
there
the
grandfather
of
future
queens
was
now
residing
in
modest
state
devoting
the
evening
of
his
life
to
the
composition
of
an
authentic
record
of
the
late
rebellion
and
of
those
few
years
during
which
he
had
been
at
the
head
of
affairs
in
england
sir
john
kirkland
who
had
never
forgotten
his
own
disappointments
in
the
beginning
of
his
master
restored
fortunes
had
a
for
ned
hyde
in
his
fall
as
a
statesman
he
was
next
in
capacity
to
wentworth
said
sir
john
and
yet
a
painted
favourite
and
a
rabble
of
shallow
wits
were
strong
enough
to
undermine
him
the
old
knight
confessed
that
he
had
ridden
out
of
his
way
on
several
occasions
when
he
was
visiting
warner
in
the
hope
of
meeting
henrietta
and
george
on
their
ponies
and
had
more
than
once
been
so
lucky
as
to
see
them
the
girl
grows
handsomer
and
is
as
insolent
as
ever
but
she
has
a
sorrowful
look
which
assures
me
she
misses
her
mother
though
it
was
indeed
of
that
wretch
her
father
she
talked
most
she
said
he
had
told
her
he
was
likely
to
go
on
a
foreign
embassy
if
it
is
to
france
he
goes
there
is
an
end
of
montpelier
the
same
country
shall
not
hold
him
and
my
daughter
while
i
live
to
protect
you
angela
began
to
understand
that
it
was
his
fear
or
his
hatred
of
fareham
which
was
taking
him
out
of
his
native
country
no
word
had
been
said
of
her
betrothal
since
that
fatal
night
it
seemed
tacitly
understood
that
all
was
at
an
end
between
her
and
denzil
warner
she
herself
had
been
prostrate
with
a
low
nervous
fever
during
a
considerable
part
of
that
long
period
of
apprehension
and
distress
in
which
denzil
lay
almost
at
the
point
of
death
nursed
by
his
mother
to
whom
the
very
name
of
his
so
lately
betrothed
wife
was
hateful
verily
the
papistical
bride
had
brought
a
greater
trouble
to
that
house
than
even
lady
warner
prejudiced
mind
had
anticipated
kneeling
by
her
son
bed
exhausted
with
the
passion
of
long
prayers
for
his
recovery
the
mother
thoughts
went
back
to
the
day
when
angela
crossed
the
threshold
of
that
house
for
the
first
time
so
fair
so
modest
with
a
countenance
so
innocent
in
its
pensive
beauty
and
yet
she
was
guilty
at
heart
even
then
lady
warner
told
herself
in
the
long
after
the
trial
at
westminster
hall
when
public
confession
of
an
unlawful
love
had
been
reported
to
her
by
her
favourite
nonconformist
divine
who
had
been
in
court
throughout
the
trial
with
lady
warner
lawyer
watching
the
proceedings
in
the
interest
of
sit
denzil
lady
warner
received
the
news
of
the
verdict
and
sentence
with
unspeakable
indignation
and
my
murdered
son
she
gasped
for
i
know
not
yet
that
god
will
hear
my
prayers
and
raise
him
up
to
me
again
is
his
blood
to
count
for
nothing
or
his
sufferings
his
patient
sufferings
on
that
bed
a
fine
a
paltry
fine
a
trifle
for
a
rich
man
i
would
pay
thrice
as
much
though
it
beggared
me
to
see
him
sent
to
the
plantations
o
judge
and
avenger
of
israel
thou
hast
scourged
us
with
pestilence
and
punished
us
with
fire
but
thou
hast
not
convinced
us
of
sin
the
world
is
so
sunk
in
wickedness
that
murder
scarce
counts
for
crime
the
day
of
terror
was
past
denzil
convalescence
was
proceeding
slowly
but
without
retrograde
stages
his
youth
and
temperate
habits
had
helped
his
recovery
from
a
wound
which
in
the
earlier
stages
looked
fatal
he
was
now
able
to
sit
up
in
an
armchair
and
talk
to
his
visitor
when
sir
john
rode
twenty
miles
to
see
him
but
only
once
did
his
lips
shape
the
name
that
had
been
so
dear
and
that
occasion
was
at
the
end
of
a
visit
which
sir
john
announced
as
the
last
our
goods
are
packed
and
ready
for
shipping
he
said
my
daughter
and
i
will
begin
our
journey
to
montpelier
early
next
week
it
was
the
first
time
sir
john
had
spoken
of
his
daughter
in
that
if
she
should
ever
talk
of
me
in
the
time
to
come
denzil
said
speaking
very
slowly
in
a
low
voice
as
if
the
effort
mental
and
physical
were
almost
beyond
his
strength
and
holding
the
hand
which
sir
john
had
given
him
in
saying
tell
her
that
i
shall
ever
remember
her
with
a
compassionate
affection
ever
hold
her
the
dearest
and
loveliest
of
women
yes
even
if
i
should
marry
and
see
the
children
of
some
fair
and
chaste
wife
growing
up
around
me
she
will
ever
be
the
first
and
tell
her
that
i
know
she
forswore
herself
in
the
court
and
that
she
was
the
innocent
dupe
of
that
villain
never
his
consenting
companion
and
tell
her
that
i
pity
her
even
for
that
so
misplaced
affection
which
tempted
her
to
swear
to
a
lie
i
knew
sir
always
that
she
loved
him
and
not
me
yes
from
the
first
indeed
sir
it
was
but
too
easy
to
read
that
unconscious
beginning
of
unholy
love
which
grew
and
strengthened
like
some
fatal
disease
i
knew
but
nursed
the
fond
hope
that
i
could
win
her
heart
in
spite
of
him
i
fancied
that
right
must
prevail
over
wrong
but
it
does
not
you
see
sir
not
always
not
a
faintness
came
over
him
whereupon
his
mother
the
room
at
this
moment
ran
to
him
and
restored
him
with
the
strong
essence
that
stood
handy
among
the
medicine
bottles
on
the
table
by
his
chair
you
have
suffered
him
to
talk
too
much
she
said
glancing
angrily
at
sir
john
and
i
warrant
he
has
been
talking
of
your
daughter
whose
name
must
be
poison
to
him
god
knows
is
worse
than
poison
to
me
madam
i
did
not
come
to
this
house
to
hear
my
daughter
abused
it
would
have
better
become
you
sir
john
kirkland
to
keep
away
from
this
house
mother
silence
you
distress
me
worse
than
my
illness
this
madam
is
my
farewell
visit
you
will
not
be
plagued
any
more
with
me
said
sir
john
lifting
his
hat
and
bowing
low
to
lady
warner
he
was
gone
before
she
could
reply
the
baggage
was
ready
clothes
books
guns
plate
and
linen
all
necessaries
for
an
exile
that
might
last
for
years
had
been
packed
for
the
sea
voyage
but
the
trunks
and
bales
had
not
yet
been
placed
in
the
waggon
that
was
to
convey
them
to
the
tower
wharf
where
they
were
to
be
shipped
in
one
of
the
that
came
at
this
season
from
valencia
laden
with
that
choice
and
costly
fruit
and
returned
with
a
heterogeneous
cargo
at
valencia
the
goods
would
be
put
on
board
a
mediterranean
coasting
vessel
and
landed
at
cette
sir
john
began
to
waver
about
his
destination
after
having
heard
from
henriette
of
her
father
possible
embassy
certainly
if
fareham
were
to
be
employed
in
foreign
diplomacy
paris
seemed
a
likely
post
for
a
man
who
was
so
well
known
there
and
had
spent
so
much
of
his
life
in
france
and
if
fareham
were
to
be
at
paris
sir
john
considered
montpelier
remote
as
it
was
from
the
capital
too
near
his
enemy
he
has
proved
himself
an
indomitable
villain
thought
the
knight
and
i
could
not
always
keep
as
close
a
watch
upon
my
daughter
as
i
have
done
in
the
last
six
weeks
no
if
fareham
be
for
france
i
am
for
some
other
country
i
might
take
her
to
florence
and
put
the
apennines
between
her
and
that
daring
wretch
it
may
be
too
that
sir
john
had
another
reason
for
lingering
after
all
was
ready
for
the
journey
he
may
have
been
much
influenced
by
concern
about
his
grandchildren
and
may
have
hesitated
at
leaving
them
alone
in
england
with
only
salaried
guardians
their
father
concerns
himself
very
little
about
them
you
see
he
told
angela
since
he
can
entertain
the
project
of
a
foreign
embassy
while
those
little
wretches
are
pining
in
a
lonely
barrack
in
oxfordshire
indeed
sir
he
is
a
fond
father
i
would
wager
my
life
that
he
is
deeply
concerned
about
them
oh
he
is
an
angel
on
your
showing
you
would
blacken
your
character
to
make
him
a
saint
the
next
day
was
fine
and
sunny
a
temperature
as
of
april
after
the
morning
frost
had
melted
there
was
a
late
rose
or
two
still
lingering
in
the
sheltered
buckinghamshire
valley
though
it
wanted
but
a
fortnight
of
christmas
angela
and
her
father
were
sitting
in
a
parlour
that
faced
the
iron
gates
since
their
return
from
london
sir
john
had
seemed
uneasy
when
his
daughter
was
out
of
his
sight
and
she
perceiving
his
watchfulness
and
trouble
had
been
content
to
abandon
her
favourite
walks
in
the
lanes
and
woods
and
to
the
fair
hill
of
brill
whence
the
view
was
so
lovely
and
so
vast
on
one
side
reaching
to
the
welsh
mountains
and
on
another
commanding
the
nearer
prospect
of
the
great
fat
common
of
ottmoor
as
aubrey
calls
it
which
in
some
winters
is
like
a
sea
of
waters
for
her
father
comfort
noting
the
sad
wistful
eyes
that
watched
her
coming
in
and
going
out
she
had
resigned
herself
to
spend
long
melancholy
hours
within
doors
reading
aloud
till
sir
john
fell
asleep
playing
backgammon
a
game
she
detested
worse
even
than
which
latter
primitive
game
they
played
sometimes
on
the
in
the
hall
life
could
scarcely
be
sadder
than
angela
life
in
those
grey
winter
days
and
had
it
not
been
for
an
occasional
ride
across
country
with
her
father
health
and
spirits
must
alike
have
succumbed
to
this
monotony
of
sadness
this
morning
as
on
many
mornings
of
late
the
subject
of
the
boy
and
girl
at
chilton
had
been
discussed
with
the
knight
tankard
of
and
his
daughter
chocolate
indeed
sir
it
would
be
a
cruel
thing
for
us
to
abandon
them
at
montpelier
we
shall
be
a
fortnight
journey
from
england
and
if
either
of
those
dear
creatures
should
fall
ill
dangerously
ill
perhaps
their
father
beyond
the
seas
and
we
too
absent
oh
sir
figure
to
yourself
henriette
or
george
dying
among
strangers
a
cold
or
a
fever
might
carry
them
off
in
a
few
days
and
we
should
know
nothing
till
all
was
over
sir
john
groaned
and
paced
the
room
agitated
by
the
funereal
image
why
what
a
raven
thou
art
ever
to
croak
dismal
prophecies
the
children
are
strong
and
well
and
have
careful
custodians
i
can
have
no
dealings
with
their
father
must
i
tell
you
that
a
hundred
times
angela
he
is
a
consummate
villain
and
were
it
not
that
i
fear
to
make
a
bigger
scandal
he
or
i
should
not
have
survived
many
hours
after
that
iniquitous
sentence
a
happy
solution
of
this
difficulty
which
distressed
the
knight
much
more
than
his
stubbornness
allowed
him
to
admit
was
close
at
hand
that
morning
while
angela
bent
over
her
embroidery
frame
and
her
father
spelt
through
the
last
that
the
post
had
brought
him
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
roll
of
wheels
announced
a
visit
and
while
they
were
looking
at
the
gate
full
of
wonder
since
their
visitors
were
of
so
small
a
number
a
footman
in
the
fareham
livery
pulled
the
iron
ring
that
hung
by
a
chain
from
the
stone
pillar
and
the
bell
rang
loud
and
long
in
the
frosty
air
the
fareham
livery
twice
before
the
fareham
coaches
and
liveries
had
taken
that
quiet
household
by
surprise
but
terror
rather
than
surprise
was
in
angela
mind
as
she
stood
in
front
of
the
window
looking
at
the
gate
could
fareham
be
so
rash
as
to
face
her
father
so
daring
as
to
seek
a
farewell
interview
on
the
eve
of
departure
no
she
told
herself
such
folly
was
impossible
the
visitor
could
be
but
one
person
henriette
even
assured
of
this
in
her
own
mind
she
did
not
rush
to
welcome
her
niece
but
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
waiting
for
the
opening
of
the
gate
old
reuben
having
seen
the
footman
went
himself
to
admit
the
visitors
with
his
grandson
and
slave
in
attendance
it
must
be
her
little
ladyship
he
said
taking
his
young
mistress
view
of
the
case
lord
fareham
would
never
dare
to
show
his
deceiving
face
here
a
shrill
voice
greeted
him
from
the
coach
window
before
he
reached
the
gate
you
are
the
slowest
old
wretch
i
ever
saw
cried
the
voice
do
you
know
that
when
visitors
of
importance
come
to
a
house
they
expect
to
be
let
in
i
vow
a
convent
gate
would
be
opened
quicker
indeed
your
ladyship
when
your
legs
are
as
old
as
mine
which
i
hope
they
never
will
be
muttered
henriette
as
she
descended
with
a
languid
slowness
from
the
coach
assisted
on
either
side
by
a
footman
while
george
who
could
not
wait
for
her
airs
and
graces
let
himself
out
at
the
door
on
the
off
side
just
as
reuben
succeeded
in
turning
the
key
so
you
are
old
reuben
he
said
patting
the
butler
on
the
shoulder
with
the
gold
hilt
of
his
and
you
were
here
like
a
vegetable
all
through
the
civil
wars
and
the
commonwealth
yes
your
lordship
from
the
raising
of
hampden
regiment
ah
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
it
over
a
pipe
and
a
bottle
you
must
be
vastly
good
company
i
am
come
to
live
here
to
live
here
your
honour
yes
sister
and
i
are
to
live
here
while
my
father
represents
his
majesty
beyond
seas
i
hope
you
have
good
stabling
and
plenty
of
room
my
ponies
and
mistress
henriette
arab
horse
will
be
here
i
doubt
i
shall
have
to
build
a
place
for
my
hawks
but
i
suppose
sir
john
will
find
me
a
cottage
for
my
dutch
falconer
lord
how
the
young
master
do
talk
exclaimed
reuben
with
an
admiring
grin
the
boy
was
so
rapid
in
his
speech
had
such
vivacity
and
courage
in
his
face
such
a
spring
in
every
movement
as
if
he
had
quicksilver
in
his
veins
reuben
thought
but
it
was
only
the
quicksilver
of
youth
that
divine
ichor
which
lasts
for
so
brief
a
season
it
made
me
feel
twenty
years
younger
only
to
hear
him
prattle
reuben
said
afterwards
sir
john
and
his
daughter
had
come
to
meet
the
children
by
this
time
and
there
were
fond
embracings
in
the
midst
of
which
henriette
withdrew
herself
from
her
grandfather
arms
and
retired
a
couple
of
paces
in
order
to
drop
him
the
jennings
curtsy
sinking
almost
to
the
ground
and
then
rising
from
billows
of
silk
like
venus
from
the
sea
and
handing
him
a
letter
with
a
circular
sweep
of
her
arm
learnt
in
london
from
her
parisian
dancing
mistress
an
apprentice
of
andr√©
not
from
the
shabby
little
french
from
oxford
my
father
sends
you
this
letter
sir
is
your
father
at
chilton
no
sir
he
was
with
us
the
day
before
yesterday
to
bid
us
before
he
started
upon
his
foreign
embassy
replied
henriette
struggling
with
her
tears
lest
she
should
seem
a
child
and
not
the
woman
of
fashion
she
aspired
to
be
he
left
us
early
in
the
afternoon
to
ride
back
to
london
and
he
takes
barge
this
afternoon
to
gravesend
to
embark
for
archangel
on
his
way
to
moscow
i
doubt
you
know
he
is
to
be
his
ambassador
at
muscovy
i
know
nothing
but
what
you
told
me
day
henriette
the
knight
answered
as
they
went
to
the
house
where
george
began
to
run
about
on
an
exploration
of
corridors
and
then
escaped
to
the
stables
while
henriette
stood
in
front
of
the
great
wood
fire
and
warmed
her
hands
in
a
stately
manner
angela
had
found
no
words
of
welcome
for
her
niece
yet
she
only
hugged
and
kissed
her
and
now
occupied
herself
unfastening
the
child
hood
and
cloak
how
your
hands
shake
auntie
you
must
be
colder
than
i
am
though
that
leathern
coach
lets
in
the
wind
like
a
sieve
i
suppose
my
people
will
know
where
to
dispose
themselves
she
added
resuming
her
grand
air
reuben
will
take
care
of
them
dearest
why
your
voice
shakes
like
your
hands
and
oh
how
white
you
are
but
you
are
glad
to
see
us
i
hope
gladder
than
i
can
say
henriette
i
am
glad
you
do
call
me
papillon
i
have
left
off
that
ridiculous
name
which
i
ought
never
to
have
permitted
i
doubt
mistress
you
who
know
so
much
know
what
is
in
this
letter
said
sir
john
staring
at
fareham
superscription
as
if
he
had
come
suddenly
upon
an
adder
nay
sir
i
only
know
that
my
father
was
shut
in
his
library
for
a
long
time
writing
and
was
as
white
as
my
aunt
is
now
when
he
brought
it
to
me
and
george
and
your
gouvernante
and
servants
are
to
go
to
the
manor
moat
the
day
after
he
said
you
are
to
give
this
letter
into
your
grandfather
hand
i
have
done
my
duty
and
await
your
pleasure
our
gouvernante
is
not
the
frenchwoman
father
dismissed
her
for
neglecting
my
education
and
walking
out
after
dark
with
daniel
lettsome
is
only
priscilla
who
is
something
between
a
servant
and
a
friend
and
who
does
everything
i
tell
her
a
pretty
gouvernante
nay
sir
she
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
that
is
one
of
her
merits
mademoiselle
thought
herself
pretty
and
angled
for
a
rich
husband
please
be
so
good
as
to
read
your
letter
grandfather
for
i
believe
it
is
about
us
sir
john
broke
the
seal
and
began
to
read
the
letter
with
a
frowning
brow
which
lightened
as
he
read
angela
stood
with
her
niece
clasped
in
her
arms
and
watched
her
father
countenance
across
the
silky
brown
head
that
nestled
against
her
bosom
sir
were
it
not
in
the
interests
of
others
who
must
needs
hold
a
place
in
your
affection
second
only
to
that
they
have
in
my
heart
i
should
scarce
presume
to
address
you
but
it
is
to
the
grandfather
of
my
children
i
write
rather
than
to
the
gentleman
whom
i
have
so
deeply
offended
i
look
back
sir
and
repent
the
violence
of
that
unhappy
night
but
know
no
change
in
the
melancholy
passion
that
impelled
me
to
crime
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
had
i
been
the
worst
at
whitehall
than
to
have
held
myself
aloof
from
the
modish
vices
of
my
day
only
to
concentrate
all
my
desires
and
affections
there
where
it
was
most
sinful
to
place
them
enough
sir
did
i
stand
alone
i
should
have
found
an
easy
solution
of
all
difficulties
and
you
and
the
lady
my
madness
has
so
insulted
would
have
been
rid
for
ever
of
the
despicable
wretch
who
now
addresses
you
i
had
to
remember
the
dear
innocents
who
bring
you
this
letter
and
it
was
of
them
i
thought
when
i
humbled
myself
to
turn
courtier
in
order
to
obtain
the
post
of
ambassador
to
muscovy
in
which
savage
place
i
shall
be
so
remote
from
all
who
ever
knew
me
in
this
country
that
i
shall
be
as
good
as
dead
and
you
would
have
as
much
compunction
in
withholding
your
love
and
protection
from
my
boy
and
girl
as
if
they
were
de
facto
orphans
i
send
them
to
you
sir
unheralded
i
fling
them
into
the
bosom
of
your
love
they
are
rich
and
the
allowance
that
will
be
paid
you
for
them
will
cover
i
apprehend
all
outlays
on
their
behalf
or
can
be
increased
at
your
pleasure
my
lawyers
whom
you
know
will
be
at
your
service
for
all
communications
and
they
will
spare
you
the
pain
of
correspondence
with
me
i
leave
the
nurture
education
and
happiness
of
these
my
only
son
and
daughter
solely
in
your
care
and
authority
they
have
been
reared
in
luxury
and
have
been
spoiled
by
injudicious
indulgence
but
their
faults
are
trivial
faults
and
are
all
on
the
surface
they
are
truthful
and
have
warm
and
generous
hearts
i
shall
deem
it
a
further
favour
if
you
will
allow
their
nurse
or
priscilla
baker
to
remain
with
them
as
your
servant
and
subject
to
your
authority
their
horses
ponies
hawks
and
hounds
carriages
must
be
accommodated
or
not
at
your
pleasure
my
girl
is
greatly
taken
up
with
the
arab
horse
i
gave
her
on
her
last
birthday
and
i
should
be
glad
if
your
stable
could
shelter
him
i
subscribe
myself
perhaps
for
the
last
time
sir
your
obedient
servant
and
a
penitent
sinner
fareham
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
letter
reading
slowly
and
thoughtfully
sir
john
handed
it
to
his
daughter
in
a
dead
silence
she
tried
to
read
but
at
sight
of
the
beloved
writing
a
rush
of
tears
blinded
her
and
she
gave
the
letter
back
to
her
father
i
can
not
read
it
sir
she
sobbed
tell
me
only
are
we
to
keep
the
children
yes
henceforward
they
are
our
children
and
it
will
be
the
business
of
our
lives
to
make
them
happy
if
you
cry
tante
i
shall
think
you
are
vexed
that
we
have
come
to
plague
you
said
henriette
with
a
pretty
womanly
air
i
am
very
sorry
for
his
poor
lordship
for
he
also
cried
when
he
kissed
us
but
he
will
have
skating
and
sledging
in
muscovy
and
he
will
shoot
bears
so
he
will
be
very
happy
chapter
xxviii
in
a
dead
calm
the
great
bales
and
chests
and
leather
trunks
on
the
filling
whereof
sir
john
household
had
bestowed
a
week
labour
were
all
unpacked
and
cleared
out
of
the
hall
to
make
room
for
a
waggon
load
of
packages
from
chilton
abbey
which
preliminary
waggon
was
followed
day
after
day
by
other
conveyances
laden
with
other
possessions
of
the
honourable
henriette
or
the
honourable
george
the
young
lady
virginals
her
guitar
her
embroidery
frames
her
books
her
babies
which
the
maids
had
packed
although
it
was
long
since
she
had
played
with
them
the
young
guns
and
whips
tennis
rackets
bows
and
arrows
and
a
mass
of
heterogeneous
goods
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
two
children
personal
property
and
it
was
well
that
the
old
house
was
sufficiently
spacious
to
afford
a
wing
for
their
occupation
they
brought
their
gouvernante
and
a
valet
and
maid
the
falconer
and
three
grooms
for
whom
lodgings
had
to
be
found
the
valet
and
spent
some
days
in
distributing
and
arranging
all
that
mass
of
belongings
but
at
the
end
of
their
labour
the
children
rooms
looked
more
cheerful
than
their
luxurious
quarters
at
chilton
and
the
children
themselves
were
delighted
with
their
new
home
we
are
lodged
ever
so
much
better
here
than
at
the
abbey
george
told
his
grandfather
we
were
ever
so
far
away
from
father
and
mother
and
the
house
was
under
a
curse
being
stolen
from
the
church
in
king
reign
once
when
i
had
a
fever
an
old
grey
monk
came
and
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
between
the
curtains
and
would
go
away
he
sat
there
always
till
i
began
to
get
well
again
father
said
there
was
nothing
there
and
it
was
only
the
fever
made
me
see
him
but
i
know
it
was
the
ghost
of
one
of
the
monks
who
were
flung
out
to
starve
when
the
abbey
was
seized
by
cromwell
men
not
oliver
cromwell
grandfather
but
another
bad
man
of
the
name
who
had
his
head
cut
off
afterwards
though
i
doubt
he
deserved
the
axe
less
than
the
brewer
did
there
was
no
more
talk
of
montpelier
or
exile
a
new
life
began
in
the
old
house
in
the
valley
with
new
pleasures
new
motives
new
duties
a
life
in
which
the
children
were
paramount
these
two
eager
young
minds
ruled
at
the
manor
moat
for
them
the
teemed
with
carp
and
tench
for
them
hawks
flew
and
hounds
ran
and
horses
and
ponies
were
moving
from
morning
till
twilight
for
them
sir
john
grew
young
again
and
hunted
fox
and
hare
and
rode
with
the
hawks
with
all
the
pertinacity
of
youth
for
whom
there
is
no
such
word
as
enough
for
them
the
happy
grandfather
lived
in
his
boots
from
october
to
march
and
the
adoring
aunt
spent
industrious
hours
in
the
fabrication
of
flies
for
trout
after
the
recipes
in
agreeable
book
the
whole
establishment
was
ordered
for
their
comfort
and
pleasure
but
their
education
and
improvement
were
also
considered
in
everything
a
roman
catholic
gentleman
from
omer
was
engaged
as
george
tutor
and
to
teach
angela
and
henriette
latin
and
italian
studies
in
which
the
niece
was
stimulated
to
industry
by
her
desire
to
surpass
her
aunt
an
ambition
which
her
volatile
spirits
never
allowed
her
to
realise
for
all
other
learning
and
accomplishments
angela
was
her
only
teacher
and
as
the
girl
grew
to
womanhood
aunt
and
niece
read
and
studied
together
like
sisters
rather
than
like
pupil
and
mistress
and
angela
taught
henriette
to
love
those
books
which
fareham
had
given
her
and
so
in
a
manner
the
intellect
of
the
banished
father
influenced
the
growing
mind
of
the
child
together
and
of
one
opinion
in
all
things
aunt
and
niece
visited
and
ministered
to
the
neighbouring
poor
or
entertained
their
genteel
neighbours
in
a
style
at
once
friendly
and
elegant
no
existence
could
have
been
calmer
or
happier
to
one
who
was
content
to
renounce
all
passionate
hopes
and
desires
all
the
romantic
aspirations
of
youth
and
angela
had
resigned
herself
to
such
renunciation
when
she
rose
from
her
after
the
tragedy
at
chilton
here
was
the
calm
of
the
convent
without
its
restrictions
and
limitations
the
peace
which
is
not
of
this
world
and
yet
liberty
to
enjoy
all
that
is
fairest
and
noblest
in
this
world
for
had
not
sir
john
pledged
himself
to
take
his
daughter
and
niece
and
nephew
for
the
grand
tour
through
france
and
italy
soon
after
seventeenth
birthday
father
andrea
who
was
of
florentine
birth
would
go
with
them
and
with
such
a
cicisbeo
they
would
see
and
understand
all
the
treasures
of
the
past
and
the
present
antique
and
modern
art
lord
fareham
was
still
in
the
north
of
europe
but
after
three
years
in
russia
had
been
transferred
from
moscow
to
copenhagen
where
he
was
in
high
favour
with
the
king
of
denmark
denzil
warner
had
lately
married
a
young
lady
of
fortune
the
only
child
and
heiress
of
a
wiltshire
gentleman
who
had
made
a
considerable
figure
in
parliament
under
the
protector
but
was
now
retired
from
public
affairs
and
all
that
remained
to
angela
of
her
story
of
impassioned
love
sole
evidence
of
the
homage
that
had
been
offered
to
her
beauty
or
her
youth
was
a
letter
now
long
grown
dim
with
tears
which
henriette
had
given
to
her
on
the
first
night
the
children
spent
under
their
grandfather
roof
i
was
to
hand
you
this
when
no
one
was
by
the
girl
said
simply
and
left
her
aunt
standing
mute
and
pale
with
a
sealed
letter
in
her
hand
how
shall
i
thank
or
praise
you
for
the
sacrifice
your
love
made
for
one
so
unworthy
a
sacrifice
that
cut
me
to
the
heart
alas
my
beloved
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
hadst
thou
given
me
thyself
rather
than
so
empty
a
gift
as
thy
good
name
i
hoped
to
tell
you
lip
to
lip
in
one
last
meeting
all
my
gratitude
and
all
my
hopeless
love
but
though
i
have
watched
and
hung
about
your
gardens
and
meadows
day
after
day
you
have
been
too
jealously
guarded
or
have
kept
too
close
and
only
with
my
pen
can
i
bid
you
an
eternal
farewell
i
go
out
of
your
life
for
ever
since
i
am
leaving
for
a
distant
country
with
the
fixed
intention
never
to
return
to
england
i
bequeath
you
my
children
as
if
i
left
you
a
rag
of
my
own
lacerated
heart
if
you
ever
think
of
me
i
pray
you
to
consider
the
story
of
my
life
as
that
of
an
invincible
passion
wicked
and
desperate
if
you
will
but
constant
as
life
and
death
you
were
and
are
and
will
be
to
my
latest
breath
my
only
love
perhaps
you
will
think
sometimes
as
i
shall
think
always
that
we
might
have
lived
innocently
and
happily
in
new
england
forgetting
and
forgotten
by
the
rabble
we
left
behind
us
having
shaken
off
the
slough
of
an
unhappy
life
beginning
the
world
again
under
new
names
in
a
new
climate
and
country
it
was
a
guilty
dream
to
entertain
perhaps
but
i
shall
dream
it
often
enough
in
a
strange
land
among
strange
faces
and
strange
manners
shall
dream
of
you
on
my
and
open
dying
eyes
to
see
you
standing
by
my
bedside
looking
down
at
me
with
that
sweetly
sorrowful
look
i
remember
best
of
all
the
varying
expressions
in
the
face
i
farewell
for
ever
while
her
son
and
daughter
were
growing
up
at
the
manor
moat
lady
fareham
sparkled
at
the
french
court
one
of
the
most
brilliant
figures
in
that
brilliant
world
a
frequent
guest
at
the
louvre
and
palais
royal
and
the
palace
of
versailles
where
the
largest
court
that
had
ever
collected
round
a
throne
was
accommodated
in
a
building
of
palladian
richness
in
ornament
and
detail
a
palace
whose
offices
were
spacious
enough
for
two
thousand
servants
no
foreigner
at
the
great
king
court
was
more
admired
than
the
lovely
lady
fareham
whose
separation
from
her
husband
occasioned
no
scandal
in
a
society
where
the
husbands
of
beautiful
women
were
for
the
most
part
gentlemen
who
pursued
their
own
vulgar
amours
abroad
and
allowed
a
wide
liberty
to
the
venus
at
home
nor
was
henri
de
malfort
constant
attendance
upon
her
ladyship
a
cause
of
since
there
was
scarce
a
woman
of
consequence
who
had
not
her
madame
de
s√©vign√©
in
one
of
those
budgets
of
parisian
scandal
with
which
she
cheered
a
kinsman
banishment
assured
bussy
de
rabutin
that
lady
fareham
had
paid
her
friend
debts
more
than
once
since
her
return
to
france
but
constancy
such
as
de
malfort
could
hardly
be
expected
were
not
the
golden
fetters
of
love
riveted
by
the
harder
metal
of
their
alliance
was
looked
on
with
favour
by
all
that
brilliant
world
and
even
tolerated
by
that
severe
moralist
the
due
du
montausier
who
had
been
lately
rewarded
for
his
wife
civility
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valli√®re
now
duchess
and
reigning
favourite
by
being
made
guardian
of
the
infant
dauphin
every
one
approved
every
one
admired
and
hyacinth
life
in
the
land
she
loved
was
like
a
long
summer
day
but
darkness
came
upon
that
day
as
suddenly
as
the
night
of
the
tropics
she
rose
one
morning
and
happy
to
pursue
the
careless
round
of
pleasure
she
lay
down
in
a
darkened
chamber
never
again
to
mix
in
that
splendid
crowd
betwixt
noon
and
twilight
henri
de
malfort
had
fallen
in
a
combat
of
eight
a
combat
so
savage
as
to
recall
that
fatal
fight
of
five
against
five
during
the
fronde
in
which
nemours
had
fallen
shot
through
the
heart
by
beaufort
the
light
words
of
a
fool
in
a
tavern
backed
by
three
other
fools
had
led
to
this
encounter
in
which
de
malfort
had
been
the
challenger
he
and
one
of
his
friends
died
on
the
ground
while
three
on
the
other
side
were
mortally
wounded
it
would
henceforth
be
fully
understood
that
lady
fareham
name
was
not
for
ribald
jesters
but
the
man
lady
fareham
loved
was
dead
and
her
life
of
pleasure
had
ended
with
a
from
an
unerring
hand
to
her
it
seemed
the
hand
of
fate
she
scarcely
thought
of
the
man
who
had
killed
him
as
her
life
had
been
brilliant
and
conspicuous
so
her
retirement
from
the
world
was
not
without
royalty
witnessed
the
solemn
office
of
the
church
which
transformed
hyacinth
lady
fareham
into
m√®re
agnes
of
the
seven
wounds
while
seated
in
the
royal
tribune
a
king
mistress
beautiful
and
adored
thought
of
a
day
when
she
too
might
bring
to
yonder
altar
the
sacrifice
of
a
broken
spirit
and
a
life
that
had
outlived
earthly
happiness
the
end
