twice
this
is
not
a
real
book
it
does
not
deal
with
real
people
nor
should
it
be
read
by
real
people
but
there
are
in
the
world
so
many
real
books
already
written
for
the
benefit
of
real
people
and
there
are
still
so
many
to
be
written
that
i
can
not
believe
that
a
little
alien
book
such
as
this
written
for
the
minority
can
be
considered
too
assertive
a
trespasser
i
have
to
thank
the

the

alone
my
self
has
grown
too
mad
for
me
to
master
craven
beyond
what
comfort
i
can
find
it
cries
god
i
am
stricken
with
cries
in
the
night
am
stricken
i
am
i
will
divorce
it
i
will
make
my
dwelling
far
from
my
self
not
through
these
tears
will
i
see
men
tears
shed
not
with
these
ears
will
i
hear
news
that
tortures
in
the
telling
i
will
go
seeking
for
my
soul
remotest
and
stillest
place
for
oh
i
starve
and
thirst
to
hear
in
quietness
man
passionate
protest
against
the
doom
with
which
his
world
is
cursed
not
my
own
not
my
own
abidings
shall
give
my
search
a
bias
and
a
bent
for
me
is
no
light
moment
of
content
for
me
no
friend
no
teller
of
the
tidings
the
waves
of
endless
time
do
sing
and
thunder
upon
the
cliffs
of
space
and
on
that
sea
i
will
sail
forth
nor
fear
to
sink
thereunder
immeasurable
time
supporting
me
that
sea
that
mother
of
a
million
summers
who
bore
with
melody
a
million
springs
shall
sing
for
my
enchantment
as
she
sings
to
life
forsaken
ones
and
death
newcomers
look
yonder
stand
the
stars
to
banish
anger
and
there
the
immortal
years
do
laugh
at
pain
and
here
is
promise
of
a
blessed
languor
to
smooth
at
last
the
seas
of
time
again
and
all
those
mothers
sons
who
did
recover
from
death
do
cry
aloud
cease
to
mourn
us
to
life
and
love
you
claimed
that
you
had
borne
us
but
we
have
found
death
kinder
than
a
i
will
divorce
my
self
alone
it
searches
amid
dark
ruins
for
its
yesterday
beats
with
its
hands
upon
the
doors
of
churches
and
at
their
altars
finds
it
can
not
pray
but
i
am
free
i
am
free
of
indecision
of
blood
and
weariness
and
all
things
cruel
i
have
sold
my
self
for
silence
for
the
jewel
of
silence
and
the
shadow
of
a
vision
chapter
i
magic
comes
to
a
committee
there
were
six
women
seven
chairs
and
a
table
in
an
otherwise
unfurnished
room
in
an
unfashionable
part
of
london
three
of
the
women
were
of
the
kind
that
has
no
life
apart
from
committees
they
need
not
be
mentioned
in
detail
the
names
of
two
others
were
miss
meta
mostyn
ford
and
lady
arabel
higgins
miss
ford
was
a
good
woman
as
well
as
a
lady
her
hands
were
beautiful
because
they
paid
a
manicurist
to
keep
them
so
but
she
was
too
righteous
to
powder
her
nose
she
was
the
sort
of
person
a
man
would
like
his
best
friend
to
marry
lady
arabel
was
older
she
was
virtuous
to
the
same
extent
as
achilles
was
invulnerable
in
the
beginning
when
her
soul
was
being
soaked
in
virtue
the
heel
of
it
was
fortunately
left
dry
she
had
a
husband
but
no
apparent
tragedy
in
her
life
these
two
women
were
obviously
not
native
to
their
surroundings
their
eyelashes
brought
bond
street
or
at
least
kensington
to
mind
their
shoes
were
mudless
their
gloves
had
not
been
bought
in
the
sales
of
the
sixth
woman
the
less
said
the
better
all
six
women
were
there
because
their
country
was
at
war
and
because
they
felt
it
to
be
their
duty
to
assist
it
to
remain
at
war
for
the
present
they
were
the
nucleus
of
a
committee
on
war
savings
and
they
were
waiting
for
their
chairman
who
was
the
mayor
of
the
borough
he
was
also
a
grocer
five
of
the
members
were
discussing
methods
of
persuading
poor
people
to
save
money
the
sixth
was
making
spots
on
the
table
with
a
pen
they
were
interrupted
not
by
the
expected
mayor
but
by
a
young
woman
who
came
violently
in
by
the
street
door
rushed
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
got
under
the
table
the
members
in
surprise
pushed
back
their
chairs
and
made
ladylike
noises
of
protest
and
inquiry
they
after
me
panted
the
person
under
the
table
all
seven
listened
to
thumping
silence
for
several
seconds
and
then
as
no
pursuing
outcry
declared
itself
the
stranger
arose
without
grace
from
her
to
anybody
except
a
member
of
a
committee
it
would
have
been
obvious
that
the
stranger
was
of
the
cinderella
type
and
bound
to
turn
out
a
heroine
sooner
or
later
but
perception
goes
out
of
committees
the
more
committees
you
belong
to
the
less
of
ordinary
life
you
will
understand
when
your
daily
round
becomes
nothing
more
than
a
daily
round
of
committees
you
might
as
well
be
dead
the
stranger
was
not
pretty
she
had
a
broad
curious
face
her
clothes
were
much
too
good
to
throw
away
you
would
have
enjoyed
giving
them
to
a
decayed
gentlewoman
i
stole
this
bun
she
explained
frankly
there
is
an
uninterned
german
baker
after
me
and
why
did
you
steal
it
asked
miss
ford
pronouncing
the
h
in
why
with
a
haughty
and
terrifying
sound
of
suction
the
stranger
sighed
because
i
could
afford
to
buy
it
and
why
could
you
not
afford
to
buy
the
bun
asked
miss
ford
a
big
strong
girl
like
you
you
will
notice
that
she
had
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
social
work
the
stranger
said
up
till
ten
this
morning
i
was
of
the
leisured
classes
like
yourselves
i
had
a
hundred
pounds
lady
arabel
was
one
of
the
kindest
people
in
the
world
but
even
she
quivered
at
the
suggestion
of
a
common
leisure
the
sort
of
clothes
the
stranger
wore
lady
arabel
would
have
called
too
dretful
if
one
is
well
dressed
one
is
proud
and
may
look
an
angel
in
the
eye
if
one
is
really
shabby
one
is
even
prouder
one
often
goes
out
of
one
way
to
look
angels
in
the
eye
but
if
one
wears
a
squirrel
fur
set
and
a
dyed
dress
that
originally
cost
two
and
a
half
guineas
one
is
damned
you
have
squandered
all
that
money
pursued
miss
ford
yes
in
ten
minutes
a
thrill
ran
through
all
six
members
several
mouths
watered
i
am
ashamed
of
you
said
miss
ford
i
hope
the
baker
will
catch
you
do
you
know
that
your
country
is
engaged
in
the
greatest
conflict
in
history
a
hundred
pounds
you
might
have
put
it
in
the
war
loan
yes
said
the
stranger
i
did
that
how
i
squandered
it
miss
ford
seemed
to
be
partially
drowned
by
this
reply
one
could
see
her
wits
fighting
for
air
but
lady
arabel
had
not
committed
herself
and
therefore
escaped
this
disaster
you
behaved
foolishly
she
said
we
are
all
too
dretfully
anxious
to
subscribe
what
we
can
spare
to
the
war
loan
of
course
but
the
state
does
not
expect
more
than
that
of
us
god
bless
it
said
the
stranger
loudly
so
that
everybody
blushed
of
course
it
does
but
it
is
fun
do
you
think
when
you
are
giving
a
present
to
exceed
expectations
the
state
began
lady
arabel
but
was
nudged
into
silence
by
miss
ford
of
course
it
all
untrue
do
let
her
think
we
believe
her
the
stranger
heard
her
such
people
do
not
only
hear
with
their
ears
she
laughed
you
shall
see
the
receipt
she
said
out
of
her
large
pocket
she
dragged
several
things
before
she
found
what
she
sought
the
sixth
member
noticed
several
packets
labelled
magic
which
the
stranger
handled
very
carefully
frightfully
explosive
she
said
i
believe
you
drunk
said
miss
ford
as
she
took
the
receipt
it
really
was
a
war
loan
receipt
and
the
name
and
address
on
it
were
miss
hazeline
snow
the
bindles
pymley
gloucestershire
lady
arabel
smiled
in
a
relieved
way
she
had
not
long
been
a
social
worker
and
had
not
yet
acquired
a
taste
for
making
fools
of
the
undeserving
so
this
is
your
name
and
address
she
said
no
said
the
stranger
simply
this
is
your
name
and
address
said
lady
arabel
more
loudly
no
said
the
stranger
i
made
it
up
do
you
think
bindles
pymley
is
too
darling
quite
drunk
repeated
miss
ford
she
had
attended
eight
committee
meetings
that
week
s
s
s
sh
meta
hissed
lady
arabel
she
leaned
forward
not
smiling
but
pleasantly
showing
her
teeth
you
gave
a
false
name
and
address
my
dear
i
wonder
if
i
can
guess
why
i
dare
say
you
can
admitted
the
stranger
it
such
fun
do
you
think
to
get
no
thanks
do
you
sometimes
amuse
yourself
by
sending
postal
orders
to
people
whose
addresses
look
pathetic
in
the
telephone
book
or
by
forgetting
to
take
away
the
parcels
you
have
bought
in
poor
little
shops
or
by
standing
and
looking
with
ostentatious
respect
at
boy
scouts
on
the
march
always
bearing
in
mind
that
these
in
their
own
eyes
are
not
little
boys
trotting
behind
a
disguised
curate
but
british
troops
on
the
move
just
two
pleased
eyes
in
a
crowd
just
a
hundred
pounds
dropped
from
heaven
into
poor
bonar
law
wistful
hand
miss
ford
began
to
laugh
a
ladylike
yet
nasty
laugh
you
amuse
me
she
said
but
not
in
the
kind
of
way
that
would
make
anybody
wish
to
amuse
her
often
miss
ford
was
the
ideal
member
of
committee
and
a
committee
of
course
exists
for
the
purpose
of
damping
enthusiasms
the
stranger
manners
were
somehow
hectic
directly
she
heard
that
laughter
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
did
you
like
what
i
was
saying
she
asked
tears
climbed
down
her
cheekbones
oh
said
miss
ford
you
seem
to
be
if
not
drunk
suffering
from
some
form
of
hysteria
do
you
think
youth
is
a
form
of
hysteria
asked
the
stranger
or
hunger
or
magic
or
oh
do
recite
any
more
lists
for
the
dear
sake
implored
miss
ford
who
had
caught
this
rather
pretty
expression
where
she
caught
her
laugh
and
most
of
her
thoughts
from
contemporary
fiction
she
had
a
lot
of
friends
in
the
writing
trade
she
knew
artists
too
and
an
actress
and
a
lot
of
people
who
talked
she
very
nearly
did
something
clever
herself
she
continued
i
wish
you
could
see
yourself
trying
to
be
uplifting
between
the
munches
of
a
stolen
bun
you
laugh
too
but
perhaps
you
never
laugh
she
added
straightening
her
lips
how
mean
laugh
asked
the
stranger
i
did
know
that
noise
was
called
laughing
i
thought
you
were
just
saying
ha
at
this
moment
the
mayor
came
in
as
i
told
you
he
was
a
grocer
and
the
chairman
of
the
committee
he
was
a
bad
chairman
but
a
good
grocer
grocers
generally
wear
white
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
and
this
fancy
i
think
reflects
their
pureness
of
heart
they
spend
their
days
among
soft
substances
most
beautiful
to
touch
and
sometimes
they
sell
soaps
and
sometimes
they
chop
cheeses
and
thus
reach
the
glory
of
the
butcher
calling
without
its
painfulness
also
they
handle
shining
tins
marvellously
illustrated
mayors
and
grocers
were
of
course
nothing
to
miss
ford
but
chairmen
were
very
important
she
nodded
curtly
to
the
mayor
and
grocer
but
she
pushed
the
seventh
chair
towards
the
chairman
may
i
just
finish
with
this
applicant
she
asked
in
her
thin
inclusive
committee
voice
and
then
added
in
the
direction
of
the
stranger
no
use
talking
nonsense
we
all
see
through
you
you
can
not
deceive
a
committee
but
to
a
certain
extent
we
believe
your
story
and
are
willing
if
the
case
proves
satisfactory
to
give
you
a
helping
hand
i
will
take
down
a
few
particulars
first
your
name
m
m
mused
the
stranger
let
me
see
you
did
like
hazeline
snow
much
did
you
what
think
of
thelma
thelma
bennett
watkins
you
know
the
rutlandshire
watkinses
the
younger
branch
miss
ford
balanced
her
pen
helplessly
but
that
is
your
real
name
how
mean
real
name
asked
the
stranger
anxiously
wo
that
do
what
about
iris
hyde
you
see
the
truth
is
i
was
never
actually
christened
i
was
born
a
conscientious
objector
and
also
oh
for
the
dear
sake
be
silent
said
miss
ford
writing
down
thelma
bennett
watkins
in
this
i
take
it
is
the
name
you
gave
at
the
time
of
the
national
registration
i
forget
said
the
stranger
i
remember
that
i
put
down
my
trade
as
magic
and
they
registered
it
on
my
card
as
yet
magic
i
believe
is
a
starred
profession
what
is
your
trade
really
asked
miss
ford
i
show
you
replied
the
stranger
unbuttoning
once
more
the
flap
of
her
pocket
she
wrote
a
word
upon
the
air
with
her
finger
and
made
a
flourish
under
the
word
so
flowery
was
the
flourish
that
it
span
her
round
right
round
upon
her
toes
and
she
faced
her
watchers
again
the
committee
jumped
for
the
blind
ran
up
and
outside
the
window
at
the
end
of
a
strange
perspective
of
street
the
trees
of
some
far
square
were
as
soft
as
thistledown
against
a
sky
a
sound
came
up
the
street
the
forgotten
april
and
the
voices
of
lambs
pealed
like
bells
into
the
room
oh
let
us
flee
from
april
we
are
but
swimmers
in
seas
of
words
we
members
of
committees
and
to
the
song
of
april
there
are
no
words
what
do
we
know
and
what
does
london
know
after
all
these
years
of
learning
old
mother
london
crouches
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
she
is
walled
in
with
her
fogs
and
her
loud
noises
and
over
her
head
are
the
heavy
beams
of
her
dark
roof
and
she
has
the
barred
sun
for
a
skylight
and
winds
that
are
but
hideous
draughts
rush
under
her
door
london
knows
much
and
every
moment
she
learns
a
new
thing
but
this
she
shall
never
learn
that
the
sun
shines
all
day
and
the
moon
all
night
on
the
silver
tiles
of
her
dark
house
and
that
the
young
months
climb
her
walls
and
run
singing
in
and
out
between
her
chimneys
nothing
else
happened
in
that
room
at
least
nothing
more
important
than
the
ordinary
manifestations
attendant
upon
magic
the
lamp
had
tremulously
gone
out
coloured
flames
danced
about
the
stranger
head
one
felt
the
thrill
of
a
purring
cat
against
one
ankles
one
saw
its
green
eyes
glare
but
these
things
hardly
counted
it
was
all
over
the
mayor
was
heard
cracking
his
fingers
and
whispering
puss
puss
the
lamp
relighted
itself
nobody
had
known
that
it
was
so
gifted
the
mayor
said
splendid
miss
quite
splendid
you
make
a
fortune
on
the
stage
his
tongue
however
seemed
to
be
talking
by
itself
without
the
assistance
of
the
mayor
himself
one
could
see
that
he
was
shaken
out
of
his
usual
grocerly
calm
for
his
feverish
hand
was
stroking
a
cat
where
no
cat
was
black
cats
are
only
the
showy
properties
of
magic
easily
materialised
even
by
beginners
at
will
it
must
be
confusing
for
such
an
orderly
animal
as
the
cat
to
exist
in
this
intermittent
way
never
knowing
so
to
speak
whether
it
is
there
or
not
there
from
one
moment
to
another
the
sixth
member
took
a
severely
bitten
pen
from
between
her
lips
and
said
now
you
mention
it
i
think
i
go
down
there
again
for
the
i
can
pawn
my
nobody
of
course
took
any
notice
of
her
yet
in
a
way
her
remark
was
logical
for
that
singing
spring
that
had
for
a
moment
trespassed
in
the
room
had
reminded
her
of
very
familiar
things
and
for
a
few
seconds
she
had
stood
upon
a
beloved
hill
and
had
looked
down
between
beech
trees
on
a
far
valley
like
a
promised
land
and
had
seen
in
the
valley
a
pale
river
and
a
dark
town
like
milk
and
honey
as
for
miss
ford
she
had
become
rather
white
although
the
blind
had
now
pulled
itself
down
and
dismissed
april
miss
ford
continued
to
look
at
the
window
but
she
cleared
her
throat
and
said
hoarsely
will
you
kindly
answer
my
questions
i
asked
you
what
your
trade
was
it
too
dretful
of
me
to
interrupt
said
lady
arabel
suddenly
but
do
you
know
meta
i
feel
we
are
wasting
this
committee
time
this
young
person
needs
no
assistance
from
us
she
turned
to
the
stranger
and
added
my
dear
i
am
dretfully
ashamed
you
must
meet
my
son
rrchud
my
son
rrchud
knows
she
burst
into
tears
the
stranger
took
her
hand
i
should
like
awfully
to
meet
rrchud
and
to
get
to
know
you
better
she
said
she
grew
very
red
i
say
i
should
be
awfully
pleased
if
you
would
call
me
angela
it
was
her
name
but
she
had
noticed
that
something
of
this
sort
is
always
said
when
people
become
motherly
and
cry
then
she
went
away
lawdy
said
the
mayor
i
did
expect
she
go
out
by
the
door
somehow
look
she
left
some
sort
of
hardware
over
there
in
the
corner
it
was
a
broomstick
chapter
ii
the
committee
comes
to
magic
i
do
suppose
for
a
moment
that
you
know
mitten
island
it
is
a
difficult
place
to
get
to
you
have
to
change
seven
times
going
from
kensington
and
you
have
to
cross
the
river
by
means
of
a
ferry
on
mitten
island
there
is
a
model
village
consisting
of
several
hundred
houses
two
churches
and
one
shop
it
was
the
sixth
member
who
discovered
after
the
committee
meeting
that
the
address
on
the
forsaken
broomstick
collar
was
number
beautiful
way
mitten
island
london
the
sixth
member
although
she
was
a
member
of
committees
was
neither
a
real
expert
in
nor
a
real
lover
of
doing
good
in
doing
good
i
think
we
have
got
into
bad
habits
we
try
in
groups
to
do
good
to
the
individual
whereas
if
good
is
to
be
done
it
would
seem
more
likely
and
more
consonant
with
precedent
that
the
individual
might
do
it
to
the
group
without
the
smile
of
a
treasurer
we
can
not
unloose
our
without
the
sanction
of
a
chairman
we
have
no
courage
without
minutes
we
have
no
memory
there
is
hardly
one
of
us
who
would
dare
to
give
a
flannelette
nightgown
to
a
factory
girl
who
had
stepped
aside
without
a
committee
to
lay
the
blame
on
should
the
factory
girl
fortified
by
the
flannelette
nightgown
take
further
steps
aside
the
sixth
member
was
only
too
apt
to
put
her
trust
in
committees
herself
she
did
not
trust
at
all
though
she
thought
herself
quite
a
good
creature
as
selves
go
she
had
come
to
london
two
years
ago
with
a
little
trunk
and
a
lot
of
good
intentions
as
her
only
possessions
and
she
had
paid
the
inevitable
penalty
for
her
earnestness
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
see
any
one
of
naturally
healthy
and
rebellious
tendency
stray
into
the
flat
path
of
charity
gay
heedless
young
people
set
their
unwary
feet
between
the
flowery
borders
of
that
path
the
thin
air
of
resigned
thanks
breathed
by
the
deserving
poor
mounts
to
their
heads
like
wine
committees
lie
in
wait
for
them
on
every
side
hostels
and
settlements
entice
them
fatally
to
break
their
journey
at
every
mile
they
run
rejoicing
to
their
doom
and
i
think
shall
eventually
find
themselves
without
escape
elected
eternal
of
the
committee
that
sits
around
the
glassy
sea
the
sixth
member
was
saved
by
a
merciful
inefficiency
of
temperament
from
attaining
the
vortex
of
her
whirlpool
of
charity
to
be
in
the
vortex
is
i
believe
almost
always
to
see
less
the
bull
eye
is
generally
blind
the
sixth
member
was
a
person
who
where
social
work
was
concerned
did
more
or
less
as
she
was
told
without
doing
it
particularly
well
the
result
very
properly
was
that
all
the
work
which
a
committee
euphemistically
calls
organising
work
was
left
to
her
organising
work
consists
of
sitting
in
bound
for
remote
quarters
of
london
and
ringing
the
bells
of
people
who
are
almost
always
found
to
be
away
for
a
fortnight
the
sixth
member
had
been
ordered
to
organise
the
return
of
the
broomstick
to
its
owner
perhaps
it
would
be
more
practical
to
call
the
sixth
member
sarah
brown
the
bereaved
owner
of
the
broomstick
was
washing
her
hair
at
number
beautiful
way
mitten
island
she
was
washing
it
behind
the
counter
of
her
shop
she
was
the
manageress
of
the
only
shop
on
mitten
island
it
was
a
general
shop
but
made
a
speciality
of
such
goods
as
happiness
and
magic
unfortunately
happiness
is
rather
difficult
to
get
in
sometimes
there
was
quite
a
queue
outside
the
shop
when
it
opened
and
sometimes
there
was
a
card
outside
saying
politely
sorry
it
no
use
waiting
i
have
any
of
course
the
shop
also
sold
sunlight
soap
and
it
was
with
sunlight
soap
that
the
was
washing
her
hair
because
it
was
sunday
and
this
was
a
comparatively
cheap
amusement
she
had
no
money
she
had
meant
to
go
down
to
the
offices
of
her
employer
after
breakfast
to
borrow
some
of
the
salary
that
would
be
due
to
her
next
week
but
then
she
found
that
she
had
left
her
broomstick
somewhere
as
a
rule
harold
for
that
was
the
broomstick
name
was
fairly
independent
and
could
find
his
way
home
alone
but
when
he
got
mislaid
and
left
in
strange
hands
and
particularly
when
kindly
finders
took
him
to
scotland
yard
he
often
lost
his
head
you
in
your
innocence
are
suggesting
that
his
owner
might
have
borrowed
another
broomstick
from
stock
but
you
have
no
idea
what
arduous
work
it
is
breaking
in
a
wild
broomstick
to
the
saddle
it
sometimes
takes
days
and
is
not
really
suitable
work
for
a
woman
even
in
often
the
brutes
are
savage
and
always
they
are
obstinate
the
could
not
afford
to
go
to
the
city
by
tube
not
to
mention
the
ferry
fare
which
was
rather
expensive
and
erratic
not
being
of
course
a
flash
of
lightning
is
generally
available
for
magic
people
but
it
is
considered
not
only
unpatriotic
but
bad
form
to
use
lightning
in
the
shop
was
not
expecting
customers
on
sunday
but
its
manageress
had
hardly
got
her
head
well
into
the
basin
when
somebody
entered
she
stood
up
dripping
is
miss
thelma
bennett
watkins
at
home
asked
sarah
brown
after
a
pause
during
which
she
made
her
characteristic
effort
to
remember
what
she
had
come
for
no
said
the
other
but
do
take
a
seat
we
met
last
night
you
may
remember
perhaps
you
would
mind
lending
me
to
buy
two
chops
for
our
luncheon
i
got
an
extra
coupon
there
tinned
salmon
in
stock
but
i
do
advise
it
i
only
got
sevenpence
just
enough
to
take
me
home
answered
sarah
brown
but
i
can
pawn
my
i
dare
say
you
have
never
been
in
a
position
to
notice
that
there
is
no
on
mitten
island
the
inhabitants
of
model
villages
always
have
assured
incomes
and
pose
as
lilies
of
the
field
sarah
brown
and
her
hostess
sat
down
on
the
counter
without
regret
to
a
luncheon
consisting
of
one
orange
found
by
the
guest
in
her
bag
and
divided
and
two
thin
captain
biscuits
from
stock
they
were
both
used
to
dissolving
visions
of
impossible
chops
both
were
cheerfully
familiar
with
the
feeling
of
light
tragedy
which
invades
you
towards
six
if
you
have
not
been
able
to
afford
a
meal
since
breakfast
now
look
here
said
sarah
brown
as
she
plunged
her
into
the
orange
would
you
mind
telling
me
are
you
a
fairy
or
a
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
wo
register
it
or
put
it
on
the
i
promise
though
if
you
are
superhuman
in
any
way
i
shall
be
seriously
tempted
i
am
a
witch
said
the
witch
now
witches
and
wizards
as
you
perhaps
know
are
people
who
are
born
for
the
first
time
i
suppose
we
have
all
passed
through
this
fair
experience
we
must
all
have
had
our
chance
of
making
magic
but
to
most
of
us
it
came
in
the
boring
beginning
of
time
and
we
wasted
our
best
spells
on
plesiosauri
and
protoplasms
and
angels
with
flaming
swords
all
of
whom
knew
magic
too
and
were
not
impressed
witches
and
wizards
are
now
rare
though
not
so
rare
as
you
think
remembering
nothing
they
know
nothing
and
are
not
bored
they
have
to
learn
everything
from
the
very
beginning
except
magic
which
is
the
only
really
original
sin
to
the
magic
eye
magic
alone
is
commonplace
everything
else
is
unknown
unguessed
and
undespised
magic
people
are
always
obvious
so
obvious
that
we
veteran
souls
can
rarely
understand
them
they
are
never
subtle
and
though
they
are
new
they
are
never
modern
you
may
tell
them
in
your
cynical
way
that
is
the
only
real
day
and
that
there
is
nothing
more
unmentionable
than
yesterday
except
the
day
before
they
will
admire
your
cleverness
very
much
but
the
next
moment
you
will
find
the
witch
sobbing
over
tennyson
or
the
wizard
smiling
at
the
quaint
fancies
of
sir
edwin
landseer
you
can
not
really
stir
up
magic
people
with
ordinary
human
people
you
and
i
have
climbed
over
our
thousand
lives
to
a
too
dreadfully
subtle
eminence
in
our
day
in
our
many
days
we
have
adored
everything
conceivable
and
now
we
have
to
fall
back
on
the
inconceivable
we
stand
our
idols
on
their
heads
it
is
newer
to
do
so
and
we
think
we
prefer
them
upside
down
talking
constantly
we
reel
blindfold
through
eternity
and
perhaps
if
we
are
lucky
once
or
twice
in
a
score
of
lives
the
blindfolding
handkerchief
slips
and
we
wriggle
one
eye
free
and
see
gods
like
trees
walking
by
jove
that
gives
us
enough
to
talk
about
for
two
or
three
lives
witches
and
wizards
are
not
blinded
by
having
a
point
of
view
they
just
look
and
are
very
much
surprised
and
interested
all
witches
and
wizards
are
born
strangely
and
die
violently
they
are
descended
always
from
old
mysterious
breeds
from
women
who
wrought
domestic
magic
and
perished
for
its
sake
and
from
men
who
wrought
other
magic
among
lost
causes
and
wars
without
gain
and
fell
and
died
still
surprised
still
interested
with
their
faces
among
flowers
all
men
who
die
so
are
not
wizards
nor
are
all
martyred
and
adventuring
women
witches
but
all
such
bring
a
potential
strain
of
magic
into
their
line
a
witch
said
sarah
brown
of
course
i
have
been
trying
to
remember
what
broomsticks
reminded
me
of
a
witch
of
course
i
have
always
wished
to
be
friends
with
a
witch
the
witch
was
unaware
that
the
proper
answer
to
this
was
oh
my
dear
let
do
you
know
i
had
quite
a
on
you
from
the
first
minute
she
did
not
answer
at
all
and
sarah
brown
who
was
tired
of
proper
answers
was
not
sorry
nevertheless
the
pause
seemed
a
little
empty
so
she
filled
it
herself
saying
pedantically
of
course
i
believe
friendship
is
an
end
in
itself
only
a
means
to
an
end
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
the
witch
after
wrestling
conscientiously
with
this
remark
for
a
minute
do
tell
me
do
you
know
yourself
or
are
you
just
saying
it
to
see
what
it
means
sarah
brown
was
obviously
damped
by
this
and
the
witch
added
kindly
i
bet
you
twopence
you
do
know
what
this
place
is
a
shop
said
sarah
brown
who
was
sitting
on
the
counter
it
is
a
sort
of
convent
and
monastery
mixed
replied
the
witch
i
am
connected
with
it
officially
i
undertook
to
manage
it
yet
i
forget
what
the
proper
word
for
me
is
not
undertaker
is
it
superintendent
or
secretary
suggested
sarah
brown
moodily
superintendent
i
think
said
the
witch
at
least
i
know
peony
calls
me
soup
do
you
live
alone
yes
then
you
ought
to
live
here
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
of
its
kind
the
name
of
this
house
is
living
alone
i
read
you
the
prospectus
she
fell
suddenly
upon
her
knees
and
began
fighting
with
a
drawer
the
drawer
was
evidently
one
of
the
many
descendants
of
the
sword
excalibur
none
but
the
appointed
hand
could
draw
it
forth
the
witch
after
a
struggle
passed
this
test
and
produced
a
parchment
covered
with
large
childish
printing
in
red
ink
my
employer
made
up
this
said
the
witch
and
the
ferryman
wrote
it
out
for
us
this
is
the
prospectus
the
name
of
this
house
is
living
alone
it
is
meant
to
provide
for
the
needs
of
those
who
dislike
hotels
clubs
settlements
hostels
and
lodgings
only
less
than
their
own
homes
who
detest
landladies
waiters
husbands
and
wives
charwomen
and
all
forms
of
lookers
after
this
house
is
a
monastery
and
a
convent
for
monks
and
nuns
dedicated
to
unknown
gods
men
and
women
who
are
tired
of
being
laboriously
kind
to
their
bodies
who
like
to
be
a
little
uncomfortable
and
quite
uncared
for
who
love
to
live
from
week
to
week
without
speaking
except
to
confide
their
destinations
to
who
are
weary
of
woolly
decorations
aspidistras
and
the
eternal
two
generations
of
roses
which
riot
among
blue
ribbons
on
hireling
who
are
ignorant
of
the
science
of
tipping
and
thanking
who
do
not
know
how
to

to
be
cooked
for

said
the
witch
a
lot
of
people
can
swallow
everything
but
the
last
clause
we
have
at
present
one
guest
called
peony
she
replaced
the
prospectus
in
the
drawer
which
she
then
tried
to
shut
while
she
was
engaged
in
this
thundering
endeavour
sarah
brown
noticed
that
the
drawer
was
full
of
the
little
paper
packets
which
she
had
seen
the
day
before
in
the
witch
possession
what
do
you
do
with
your
magic
she
asked
oh
many
things
chiefly
i
use
it
as
an
ingredient
for
happiness
sometimes
to
remind
people
and
sometimes
to
make
them
forget
it
seems
to
me
that
some
people
take
happiness
rather
tragically
i
find
said
sarah
brown
rather
sententiously
that
i
always
owe
my
happiness
to
earth
never
to
heaven
how
mean
heaven
said
the
witch
i
know
nothing
about
heaven
when
i
used
to
work
in
the
city
i
bought
a
little
book
about
heaven
to
read
in
the
tube
every
morning
i
thought
i
should
grow
daily
better
but
i
could
see
that
i
did
sarah
brown
was
naturally
astonished
to
meet
any
one
who
did
not
know
all
about
heaven
but
she
continued
the
pursuit
of
her
ideas
on
happiness
sarah
brown
meant
to
write
a
book
some
day
if
she
could
find
a
really
inspiring
to
start
in
she
thought
herself
rather
good
at
ideas
poor
sarah
brown
she
simply
had
to
be
confident
about
something
she
was
only
inwardly
articulate
i
think
not
outwardly
at
all
but
sometimes
she
could
talk
about
herself
heaven
has
given
me
wretched
health
but
never
gave
me
youth
enough
to
make
the
wretchedness
adventurous
she
went
on
heaven
gave
me
a
thin
skin
but
never
gave
me
the
natural
and
comforting
affections
heaven
probably
meant
to
make
a
noble
woman
of
me
by
encrusting
me
in
disabilities
but
it
left
out
the
necessary
nobility
at
the
last
moment
it
left
out
in
fact
all
the
compensations
but
luckily
i
have
found
the
compensations
for
myself
i
just
had
to
find
something
men
and
women
have
given
me
everything
that
such
as
i
could
expect
i
have
never
met
with
reasonless
enmity
never
met
with
meanness
never
met
with
anything
more
unbearable
than
natural
indifference
from
any
man
or
woman
i
have
been
i
may
say
a
burden
and
a
bore
all
over
the
world
i
have
been
an
ill
and
fretful
stranger
within
all
men
gates
i
have
asked
much
and
given
nothing
i
have
never
been
a
friend
nobody
has
ever
expected
any
return
from
me
yet
nothing
was
grudged
landladies
policemen
chorus
girls
social
bounders
prostitutes
the
natural
enemies
one
would
say
of
such
as
i
have
given
me
kindness
and
often
much
that
they
could
not
easily
spare
and
always
amusement
and
distraction
ah
how
you
interest
and
excite
me
said
the
witch
whose
attention
had
been
frankly
wandering
you
are
exactly
the
sort
of
person
we
want
in
this
house
but
ill
said
sarah
brown
pessimistically
oh
witch
i
have
been
so
wearisome
to
every
one
so
constantly
ill
the
first
thing
i
get
to
know
about
a
new
hostess
or
a
landlady
is
always
the
colour
of
her
by
candlelight
or
whether
she
has
one
illnesses
are
never
bad
here
said
the
witch
i
bet
you
twopence
got
something
in
the
shop
that
would
make
you
well
three
fingers
of
happiness
neat
and
hot
at
night
but
witch
oh
witch
this
is
the
worst
of
all
my
ears
are
failing
me
i
think
i
am
going
deaf
you
can
hear
what
i
say
said
the
witch
yes
i
can
hear
what
you
say
but
when
most
people
talk
i
am
like
a
prisoner
locked
up
and
every
day
there
are
more
and
more
locked
doors
between
me
and
the
world
you
do
not
know
how
horrible
it
is
oh
well
said
the
witch
as
long
as
you
can
hear
magic
you
will
not
lack
a
key
to
your
prison
sometimes
it
better
not
to
hear
the
other
things
you
are
the
ideal
guest
for
the
house
of
living
alone
i
go
and
fetch
david
my
dog
and
humphrey
my
said
sarah
brown
at
that
moment
a
taxi
was
heard
to
arrive
at
the
other
side
of
the
ferry
and
the
ferryman
voice
was
heard
shouting
all
right
all
right
i
be
there
in
half
a
tick
i
hope
this
is
peony
in
a
taxi
said
the
witch
i
get
so
tired
of
expelling
guests
she
been
drawing
her
money
which
may
have
been
tempting
they
listened
they
heard
someone
alight
from
the
and
the
voice
of
miss
meta
mostyn
ford
asking
the
ferryman
do
you
know
anything
about
a
young
woman
of
the
name
of
watkins
living
at
number
beautiful
way
no
he
does
shouted
the
witch
opening
the
shop
door
but
do
step
in
we
met
yesterday
you
may
remember
i
ask
the
ferryman
to
get
halfpenny
buns
for
tea
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
lend
me
threepence
we
do
bake
ourselves
i
have
had
tea
thank
you
said
miss
ford
i
have
just
come
from
a
little
gathering
of
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
i
thought
i
would
call
here
on
my
way
home
i
had
noted
your
address
she
started
as
she
came
in
and
saw
sarah
brown
and
added
in
her
committee
voice
i
had
noted
your
address
because
i
never
mind
how
much
trouble
i
take
in
following
up
a
promising
case
sarah
brown
on
first
hearing
that
trenchant
voice
had
lost
her
head
and
begun
to
hide
under
the
counter
but
the
refused
to
make
room
so
she
drew
herself
up
and
smiled
politely
how
good
of
you
to
go
to
a
little
gathering
of
friends
said
the
witch
obviously
trying
to
behave
like
a
real
human
person
i
never
do
except
now
and
then
by
mistake
and
even
then
i
only
stay
when
there
are
grassy
sandwiches
to
eat
once
there
were
grassy
sandwiches
mixed
with
bits
of
egg
and
then
i
stayed
to
supper
you
did
have
such
luck
i
see
or
you
would
look
happier
i
do
go
to
my
friends
for
their
food
but
for
their
ideas
said
miss
ford
sarah
brown
was
gliding
towards
the
door
oh
do
go
said
the
witch
who
did
not
recognise
tact
when
she
met
it
i
have
sent
harold
the
broomstick
for
your
dog
david
and
your
humphrey
he
is
an
excellent
packer
and
very
clean
in
his
person
and
work
please
please
do
go
do
you
know
i
live
in
constant
dread
of
being
left
alone
with
a
clever
person
i
must
apologise
for
my
intrusion
in
that
case
said
miss
ford
with
dignity
i
repeat
i
only
came
because
i
saw
yours
was
an
exceptional
case
there
was
a
very
long
silence
in
the
growing
dusk
the
moon
could
already
be
seen
through
the
glass
door
rising
pushing
vigorously
aside
the
thickets
of
the
crowded
sky
a
crack
across
the
corner
of
the
glass
was
lighted
up
and
looked
like
a
little
sprig
of
lightning
plucked
from
a
passing
storm
and
preserved
in
the
glass
miss
ford
suddenly
began
to
talk
in
a
very
quick
and
confused
way
any
sane
hearer
would
have
known
that
she
was
talking
by
mistake
that
she
was
possessed
by
some
distressingly
spirit
and
that
nothing
she
might
say
in
parenthesis
like
this
ought
to
be
remembered
against
her
oh
god
said
miss
ford
i
have
come
because
i
am
hungry
hungry
for
what
you
spoke
of
last
night
in
the
dark
you
spoke
of
an
april
sea
clashing
of
cymbals
was
the
expression
you
used
was
it
you
spoke
of
a
shore
of
brown
diamonds
flat
to
the
ruffled
sea
and
white
sandhills
under
a
thin
veil
of
grass
and
tamarisks
all
blown
one
way
well
said
the
witch
well
faltered
miss
ford
i
think
i
came
to
ask
you
whether
you
knew
of
nice
lodgings
there
plain
wholesome
bath
respectable
cooking
hot
and
cold
her
voice
faded
away
pathetically
there
was
a
sudden
shattering
as
the
door
burst
open
and
a
dog
and
a
were
swept
in
by
a
brisk
broomstick
i
am
so
sorry
miss
watkins
said
miss
ford
stiffly
her
face
was
scarlet
neat
and
formal
again
now
but
i
am
so
sorry
if
i
have
talked
nonsense
i
am
rather
run
down
i
think
too
much
work
four
important
meetings
yesterday
i
sometimes
think
i
shall
break
down
i
have
such
alarming
she
looked
nervously
at
sarah
brown
it
is
always
tiresome
to
meet
of
committees
in
private
life
especially
if
one
is
in
a
mood
for
having
people
may
be
excellent
in
a
philanthropic
way
of
course
and
yet
impossible
socially
but
sarah
brown
had
heard
very
little
she
always
found
miss
voice
difficult
she
was
on
her
knees
asking
her
dog
david
what
it
had
felt
like
coming
but
david
was
still
too
much
dazed
to
say
much
you
must
not
think
said
miss
ford
that
because
i
am
a
practical
worker
i
have
no
understanding
of
inner
meanings
on
the
contrary
i
have
perhaps
wasted
too
much
of
my
time
on
spiritual
matters
that
is
why
i
take
quite
a
personal
and
special
interest
in
your
case
i
had
a
great
friend
now
in
the
trenches
alas
who
possessed
power
he
used
to
come
to
my
wednesdays
at
least
i
used
to
invite
him
to
come
but
he
was
dreamy
like
you
and
constantly
mistook
the
date
he
helped
me
enormously
and
i
miss
him
well
the
truest
charity
should
be
anything
but
formal
i
think
and
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
your
case
was
exceptional
and
that
you
also
were
occult
how
mean
occult
asked
the
witch
do
you
mean
just
knowing
magic
a
strange
mixture
mused
miss
ford
it
is
impossible
to
muse
aloud
without
a
strange
and
rather
interesting
mixture
of
naïveté
and
power
the
question
is
power
to
what
extent
miss
watkins
i
want
you
to
come
to
one
of
my
wednesdays
to
meet
one
or
two
people
who
might
possibly
help
you
to
a
job
lecturing
you
know
lectures
on
hypnotism
or
spiritualism
with
experiments
are
always
popular
you
certainly
have
power
you
only
want
a
little
advertisement
to
be
a
real
help
to
many
people
how
mean
advertisement
asked
the
witch
this
new
advertisement
stunt
is
one
of
the
problems
that
tire
my
head
i
am
awfully
worried
by
problems
the
world
seems
to
be
ruled
by
posters
now
people
look
to
the
hoardings
for
information
about
their
duty
why
we
paste
up
the
ten
commandments
on
all
the
walls
and
all
the
and
be
done
with
it
now
listen
miss
watkins
persisted
miss
ford
i
want
you
to
meet
bernard
tovey
the
painter
and
ivy
macbee
who
founded
the
aspiration
club
and
frere
the
editor
of
and
several
other
regular
wednesday
friends
of
mine
all
interested
in
the
occult
it
would
be
a
real
opportunity
for
you
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
very
angry
with
me
said
the
witch
presently
in
a
hollow
voice
if
i
was
occult
last
night
i
awfully
sorry
but
it
must
have
been
a
fluke
i
seem
to
have
said
so
much
last
night
without
knowing
it
i
afraid
i
was
showing
off
a
little
the
painful
tears
of
confession
were
in
her
eyes
but
she
added
changing
the
subject
do
you
live
alone
yes
absolutely
said
miss
ford
my
friends
call
me
a
perfect
hermit
i
hardly
ever
have
visitors
in
my
spare
room
it
makes
so
much
work
for
my
three
maids
i
suppose
you
would
care
to
divorce
your
three
maids
and
come
and
live
here
suggested
the
witch
i
could
of
course
cure
you
of
the
you
speak
of
or
rather
i
could
help
you
to
have
all
the
time
without
any
stagnant
in
between
then
you
would
notice
the
this
house
is
a
sort
of
nursing
home
and
college
combined
i
read
you
the
prospectus
very
amusing
said
miss
ford
after
waiting
a
minute
to
see
if
there
was
any
more
of
the
prospectus
she
had
quite
recovered
herself
and
was
wearing
the
brisk
acute
expression
that
deceived
her
into
claiming
a
sense
of
humour
but
why
all
those
uncomfortable
rules
and
why
that
discouragement
of
social
intercourse
i
am
afraid
the
average
person
of
the
class
you
cater
for
does
not
recognise
the
duty
of
social
intercourse
this
house
replied
the
witch
caters
for
people
who
are
outside
averages
the
ferryman
says
that
people
who
are
content
to
be
average
are
lowering
the
general
standard
i
wish
you
could
have
met
peony
the
only
guest
up
to
now
but
she
is
out
and
may
be
a
teeny
bit
drunk
when
she
comes
in
she
has
gone
to
draw
her
money
what
sort
of
money
asked
miss
ford
who
was
always
interested
in
the
sources
of
income
of
the
poor
soldier
allotment
unmarried
wife
the
expression
of
miss
ford
face
tactfully
wiped
away
this
bald
unfortunate
statement
from
the
surface
of
the
conversation
and
how
do
you
make
your
pay
she
asked
if
there
is
no
charge
for
residence
how
mean
pay
asked
the
witch
pay
whom
and
what
with
look
here
if
you
will
come
and
live
here
you
shall
have
a
little
wednesday
every
week
on
the
stairs
under
license
from
me
harold
the
broomstick
is
apt
to
shirk
cleaning
the
stairs
but
as
it
happens
he
is
keeping
company
with
an
mop
in
kentish
town
and
i
no
doubt
she
would
come
over
and
do
the
stairs
thoroughly
every
tuesday
night
besides
we
have
overalls
in
stock
at
only
two
and
eleven
three
oh
i
like
your
merry
mood
said
miss
ford
laughing
heartily
you
must
remember
to
talk
like
that
when
you
come
to
my
wednesdays
most
of
my
friends
are
utter
socialists
and
believe
in
bridging
as
far
as
possible
the
gulf
between
one
class
and
another
so
you
need
feel
shy
or
awkward
the
splashing
of
the
was
once
more
heard
and
then
the
shop
quaked
a
little
as
a
heavy
foot
alighted
on
the
the
ferryman
was
heard
saying
i
do
know
any
party
of
that
name
but
i
believe
the
young
woman
at
the
shop
can
help
you
lady
arabel
higgins
entered
the
shop
what
meta
you
here
and
sarah
brown
what
a
too
dretfully
funny
coincidence
well
angela
dear
i
made
a
note
of
your
address
yesterday
and
then
lost
the
note
too
dretfully
like
me
so
i
rang
up
the
mayor
and
he
said
he
also
had
made
a
note
and
he
would
come
and
show
me
the
way
but
i
did
wait
for
him
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
well
i
must
truly
be
going
interrupted
sarah
brown
i
just
nip
across
to
the
brown
borough
and
find
a
being
hungry
there
is
no
need
for
any
one
to
move
on
my
account
said
lady
arabel
you
all
heard
what
angela
said
last
night
in
her
little
address
to
the
committee
in
the
dark
i
do
know
why
she
addressed
her
remarks
particularly
at
me
but
as
she
did
so
there
is
no
secret
in
the
matter
of
course
just
at
first
it
seemed
dretful
to
me
that
any
one
should
know
or
speak
about
it
i
can
not
understand
how
you
knew
angela
i
am
trying
not
to
understand
she
took
up
a
thin
captain
biscuit
and
bit
it
it
trembled
in
her
hand
like
a
leaf
yes
it
is
true
that
rrchud
is
like
other
women
boys
you
know
it
meta
angela
evidently
knows
it
and
at
least
since
yesterday
i
know
that
i
know
it
his
not
being
able
to
read
or
write
i
always
knew
in
my
heart
that
my
old
tag
ca
all
be
literary
geniuses
did
meet
the
case
his
way
of
disappearing
and
never
explaining
do
you
know
i
have
only
once
seen
him
with
other
boys
doing
the
same
as
other
boys
and
that
was
when
i
saw
him
marching
with
hundreds
of
real
boys
in
it
was
the
happiest
day
i
ever
had
i
thought
after
all
that
i
had
borne
a
real
boy
well
then
as
you
know
he
could
get
a
commission
could
even
get
his
stripe
poor
darling
he
deserted
twice
pure
absence
of
mind
it
was
always
the
same
from
a
child
wanted
to
see
further
he
say
and
of
course
worse
in
the
trenches
why
you
know
it
all
angela
dear
at
least
perhaps
not
quite
all
i
should
like
to
tell
you
because
you
said
that
about
the
splendour
of
being
the
mother
of
rrchud
pinehurst
my
husband
he
is
a
doctor
you
know
had
that
same
passion
for
seeing
further
he
was
often
ill
in
london
i
said
it
was
asthma
but
he
said
it
was
not
being
able
to
see
far
enough
we
were
in
america
for
rrchud
birth
and
pinehurst
insisted
on
going
west
i
took
the
precaution
of
having
a
good
nurse
with
me
pinehurst
said
the
east
was
full
of
little
obstacles
and
people
eyes
had
sucked
all
the
secrets
out
of
the
horizon
he
said
i
like
cape
cod
but
he
said
there
was
always
a
wall
of
sea
round
those
flat
wet
places
we
stayed
in
a
blacksmith
spare
room
on
the
desert
of
wyoming
but
even
that
horizon
seemed
a
little
higher
than
we
and
one
clear
day
in
a
pink
sunrise
we
saw
something
that
might
have
been
a
dream
my
dears
and
might
have
been
the
rockies
pinehurst
could
stand
that
we
pushed
west
so
tahsome
we
climbed
a
little
narrow
track
up
a
mountain
in
a
light
buggy
that
a
goldminer
lent
us
oh
of
course
you
think
us
mad
meta
but
do
you
know
we
actually
found
the
world
edge
a
place
with
no
horizon
we
looked
between
ragged
pine
trees
and
saw
over
the
shoulders
of
great
old
violet
mountains
we
saw
right
down
into
the
stars
for
ever
there
was
a
tower
of
rocks
rocks
in
sloping
layers
sunny
hot
by
day
my
dears
and
a
great
shelter
by
night
you
know
the
little
dark
clouds
walk
alone
upon
the
mountain
tops
at
sunset
as
you
said
angela
they
are
like
trees
and
sometimes
like
faces
and
sometimes
like
the
shadows
of
little
bent
gipsies
i
used
to
look
at
the
mountains
and
think
am
i
about
to
be
so
worried
and
so
small
in
sight
of
such
an
enormous
storm
of
mountains
under
a
gold
sky
i
think
of
those
rocks
often
at
night
standing
just
as
we
left
them
all
by
themselves
under
that
unnatural
moon
it
was
an
unnatural
moon
on
the
edge
of
the
world
there
all
by
themselves
with
no
watching
eyes
to
spoil
them
as
pinehurst
used
to
say
not
even
own
eyes
you
say
that
adventure
my
one
adventure
was
impossible
meta
yes
it
was
rrchud
was
an
impossible
boy
born
on
an
impossible
day
in
an
impossible
place
ah
my
poor
rrchud
my
dears
i
am
talking
dretful
nonsense
we
were
mad
you
have
to
know
pinehurst
really
to
understand
it
ah
we
can
never
find
our
mountain
again
i
can
never
forgive
pinehurst
you
can
never
repay
pinehurst
said
the
witch
lady
arabel
did
not
seem
to
hear
for
a
long
time
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
but
sarah
brown
murmuring
to
her
dog
david
you
must
excuse
her
and
remember
that
she
lived
most
utterly
alone
she
was
locked
inside
herself
and
the
solitary
barred
window
in
her
prison
wall
commanded
only
a
view
of
the
dog
david
rrchud
mother
said
at
last
i
really
came
to
tell
you
that
rrchud
came
back
on
leave
unexpectedly
last
night
of
course
you
must
meet
him
rrchud
home
exclaimed
miss
ford
how
odd
i
was
just
telling
miss
watkins
about
his
power
and
how
strongly
she
reminded
me
of
him
do
tell
him
to
keep
wednesday
afternoon
free
lady
arabel
ignoring
miss
ford
by
mistake
said
to
the
witch
will
you
come
on
tuesday
to
tea
or
supper
supper
please
said
the
witch
instantly
tact
i
repeat
was
a
stranger
to
her
so
she
added
i
will
bring
sarah
brown
too
i
bet
you
twopence
she
has
had
a
decent
meal
for
days
and
then
the
mayor
arrived
the
witch
saw
at
once
that
there
was
some
secret
understanding
between
him
and
her
that
she
did
not
understand
her
magic
escapades
often
left
her
in
this
position
however
she
winked
back
hopefully
but
she
was
not
a
skilled
winker
everybody
even
the
dog
david
saw
her
doing
it
and
miss
ford
looked
a
little
offended
chapter
iii
the
everlasting
boy
mitten
island
is
a
place
of
fine
weather
its
air
is
always
like
stained
glass
between
you
and
perfection
always
you
will
find
in
the
happy
ways
of
mitten
island
a
confidence
that
the
worst
is
left
behind
and
that
even
the
worst
was
not
so
very
bad
you
can
afford
to
remember
the
winter
for
even
the
winter
was
beautiful
you
can
smile
in
the
sun
and
think
of
the
grey
flush
that
used
to
overspread
the
island
under
its
urgent
crises
of
snow
and
it
seems
that
always
there
was
joy
running
quickly
behind
the
storms
joy
looking
with
the
sun
through
a
tall
window
in
a
cloud
even
the
most
dreadful
curtain
of
a
winter
day
was
always
drawn
up
at
sunset
its
straight
edge
rose
slowly
disclosing
flaming
space
and
the
dramatic
figures
of
the
two
island
churches
exulting
and
undying
martyrs
in
the
midst
of
flames
it
is
a
place
of
fine
weather
and
this
is
a
book
of
fine
weather
a
book
written
in
spring
i
will
not
remember
the
winter
and
the
rain
it
was
the
spring
that
brought
sarah
brown
to
mitten
island
and
the
spring
that
first
showed
her
magic
it
was
the
spring
that
awoke
her
on
her
first
morning
in
the
house
of
living
alone
she
awoke
because
it
was
so
beautiful
outside
and
because
there
was
a
beautiful
day
coming
you
could
see
the
day
secretly
making
preparations
behind
a
shining
mist
she
heard
a
sound
of
breathless
singing
and
the
whipping
of
stirred
grass
in
the
garden
the
sound
of
some
one
unbearably
happy
dancing
now
there
is
hardly
anything
but
magic
abroad
before
seven
in
the
morning
only
the
disciples
of
magic
like
getting
their
feet
wet
and
being
furiously
happy
on
an
empty
stomach
sarah
brown
went
to
her
window
the
newborn
trembling
slants
of
smoke
went
up
from
the
houses
of
the
island
there
was
a
sky
of
that
quiet
design
which
suffices
half
a
day
unchanged
a
garden
of
quite
a
good
many
yards
lay
behind
the
house
it
contained
no
potatoes
or
anything
useful
only
long
very
green
grass
and
a
may
tree
and
a
witch
dancing
the
extraordinary
music
to
which
she
was
dancing
was
partly
the
braying
of
a
neighbouring
donkey
and
partly
her
own
erratic
singing
she
danced
as
you
may
imagine
in
a
very
far
from
way
rather
like
a
baby
that
has
thought
of
a
new
funny
way
of
annoying
its
nana
and
she
sang
too
like
a
child
that
inadvertently
bursts
into
loud
tuneless
song
because
it
is
morning
and
yet
too
early
to
get
up
a
little
wandering
of
the
voice
a
little
wandering
of
the
feet
the
may
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
seemed
to
be
her
partner
a
small
blot
moved
up
and
down
the
chequered
trunk
of
the
tree
and
that
was
the
shadow
of
a
grey
squirrel
watching
the
dancing
the
squirrel
wore
the
same
fur
as
the
young
lady
wears
and
sometimes
it
looked
with
a
tilted
head
at
the
witch
and
sometimes
it
buried
its
face
in
its
hands
and
sat
for
a
while
shaken
with
secret
laughter
there
was
certainly
something
more
funny
than
beautiful
about
the
witch
dancing
she
laughed
herself
most
of
the
time
she
was
wearing
a
mackintosh
which
was
in
itself
rather
funny
but
her
feet
were
bare
a
voice
broke
in
good
for
you
cully
it
was
sarah
brown
leaning
from
her
window
the
squirrel
rippled
higher
up
the
may
tree
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
broke
like
an
eggshell
sarah
brown
turned
back
towards
her
bed
it
was
too
early
to
get
up
it
was
too
late
to
go
to
sleep
again
eunice
her
bottle
she
knew
lay
cold
as
a
serpent
to
shock
her
feet
if
she
returned
besides
the
dog
david
was
asleep
on
the
middle
of
the
counterpane
and
she
was
too
good
a
mother
to
wake
him
there
are
a
good
many
things
to
do
when
you
find
yourself
awake
too
early
it
is
said
that
some
people
sit
up
and
darn
their
stockings
but
i
refer
now
to
ordinary
people
not
to
angels
utterly
resourceless
people
find
themselves
reduced
to
reading
the
penny
stamps
on
yesterday
letters
there
is
a
good
deal
of
food
for
thought
on
a
penny
stamp
but
nothing
really
uplifting
some
people
i
know
employ
this
morning
leisure
in
scrubbing
their
consciences
clean
thus
thriftily
making
room
for
the
sins
of
the
coming
day
but
sarah
conscience
was
dreadfully
receptive
almost
magnetic
little
sins
like
smuts
lay
always
deep
upon
it
there
were
a
few
regrettable
seconds
in
every
minute
she
lived
i
think
though
she
never
enjoyed
the
compensations
attached
to
a
really
considerable
sin
anyway
her
conscience
would
have
been
a
case
for
and
when
she
was
happy
she
always
tried
to
forget
it
yet
she
was
not
without
a
good
many
very
small
and
unessential
resources
for
sleepless
moments
often
she
wrote
vague
comments
on
matters
with
which
she
was
not
familiar
in
an
always
eventually
mislaid
she
would
awake
from
dear
and
unspeakable
dreams
full
of
hope
and
tell
herself
stories
about
herself
trying
on
various
lives
and
deaths
like
clothes
the
result
was
never
likely
enough
even
to
laugh
at
she
had
watched
magic
dancing
in
a
mackintosh
and
she
was
at
a
loss
there
was
a
knock
upon
her
door
and
a
voice
hi
cocky
could
you
oblige
me
with
a
loan
of
a
few
for
the
milkman
i
a
bean
in
me
purse
nor
have
i
said
sarah
brown
opening
the
door
but
i
can
pawn
ow
come
awf
it
cuffbut
said
the
this
is
a
respectable
more
or
less
and
you
ai
goin
out
to
pawn
nothink
in
your
i
owe
it
to
the
milkman
again
not
but
what
i
better
pay
after
all
i
got
me
money
paid
yesterday
i
thought
to
put
it
away
for
elbert
are
you
peony
the
other
lodger
thet
right
dearie
peony
was
not
in
her
first
youth
in
fact
she
was
comfortably
into
her
second
her
voice
was
so
beautiful
that
it
almost
made
one
shy
but
her
choice
of
language
tending
as
it
did
in
the
other
direction
reassured
one
she
had
fine
eyes
of
an
absolute
grey
and
dark
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
drawn
down
so
as
to
make
a
triangle
of
a
face
which
left
to
itself
would
have
been
square
her
teeth
spoilt
her
the
gaps
among
them
looked
like
the
front
row
of
the
stalls
during
the
first
scene
of
a
revue
or
the
last
scene
of
a
play
by
shakspere
on
the
whole
she
looked
like
the
duckling
of
the
story
serenely
conscious
of
a
secret
swanhood
she
showed
unnatural
energy
even
in
repose
and
lived
as
though
she
had
a
taxi
waiting
at
the
door
who
elbert
asked
sarah
brown
and
then
wished
she
had
not
asked
for
even
without
peony
flush
she
should
have
guessed
a
mo
kiddie
till
i
get
rid
of
the
milkman
come
an
sit
on
the
stairs
an
i
tell
you
a
tale
i
like
no
end
tellin
this
tale
harold
the
broomstick
was
desultorily
sweeping
the
stairs
he
worked
harder
when
first
conscious
of
being
watched
but
seeing
that
they
intended
to
stay
there
on
the
top
step
he
made
this
the
excuse
to
disappear
indolently
leaving
little
heaps
of
dust
on
several
of
the
lower
steps
i
come
across
elbert
first
when
i
was
about
eight
an
twenty
said
peony
when
sarah
brown
in
rather
a
loud
had
taken
her
seat
on
the
stairs
beside
her
elbert
was
the
ideel
kid
me
nothing
to
speak
of
nothin
more
than
a
lump
o
mud
i
use
to
say
all
my
life
if
you
believe
me
cully
i
lived
in
mud
an
kep
me
eye
on
the
moon
so
to
say
i
worked
in
a
factory
all
day
makin
mud
as
it
were
for
muddy
jews
an
every
saturday
night
i
took
twelve
o
mud
to
keep
meself
alive
in
a
city
o
mud
until
the
saturday
after
but
o
nights
there
was
the
moon
or
else
the
stars
or
else
the
sunset
an
anyway
all
the
air
between
to
look
at
i
a
back
room
up
and
o
nights
i
use
to
sit
an
breave
there
an
look
at
the
sky
believe
me
dearie
i
was
mad
about
breavin
it
was
me
only
recreation
so
to
say
by
gawd
it
a
fair
wonder
the
sky
an
the
air
keeps
on
above
the
mud
and
we
looks
at
it
an
breaves
it
never
pays
no
rent
for
it
when
all
said
an
done
there
ai
never
a
penny
put
in
the
slot
for
the
moonlight
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
yet
still
it
all
goes
on
well
in
those
days
i
never
spoke
to
a
soul
an
everybody
an
i
got
very
queer
queerer
nor
many
as
is
locked
up
in
claybury
this
minute
i
got
to
thinkin
as
there
was
a
debt
over
us
all
the
sky
seemed
like
a
sort
of
upper
floor
to
all
our
with
the
stars
an
the
moon
for
windows
an
it
seemed
like
as
if
there
did
oughter
be
some
rent
to
pay
though
the
landlord
was
a
reel
gent
and
never
pressed
for
it
there
might
be
people
lived
among
flowers
in
the
sunlight
an
so
to
say
rented
the
parlour
floor
but
not
me
i
the
upper
floor
an
breaved
the
light
o
the
moon
as
for
flowers
bless
you
i
never
seen
a
flower
stuck
proper
to
the
ground
until
a
year
ago
well
dearie
i
use
to
make
believe
as
we
all
get
a
charnce
all
to
ourselves
to
pay
what
we
owed
some
people
i
thought
runs
away
from
the
debt
an
some
pays
it
in
bad
money
but
i
ses
to
meself
if
ever
my
charnce
come
i
pay
it
the
very
best
i
can
lawd
i
everybody
in
those
days
it
seemed
like
people
was
all
rotten
an
as
if
all
the
churches
an
all
the
cherities
was
the
rottenest
of
all
the
lot
well
then
dearie
elbert
blew
in
you
know
what
kids
is
mostly
like
in
the
brown
borough
but
elbert
never
was
straight
legs
an
never
a
chilblain
nor
a
sore
an
a
small
face
an
yallery
what
you
could
see
of
it
for
of
course
i
always
made
keep
it
nicely
cropped
to
the
pink
you
never
see
sich
a
clean
boy
you
never
see
but
what
seemed
to
sponged
collar
that
minute
an
the
little
seat
to
breeks
always
patched
in
the
right
colour
an
all
yet
one
of
them
kinds
could
little
game
with
the
best
of
an
often
kicked
up
no
end
of
a
row
when
we
was
pretendin
games
of
a
wet
sunday
one
little
game
loved
best
of
all
not
marbles
it
was
nor
but
there
i
wo
tell
you
what
it
was
for
you
laugh
like
the
gal
at
the
shop
did
when
i
spoke
of
it
i
do
often
get
talkin
but
i
a
nip
of
brandy
at
the
time
laugh
fit
to
bust
she
did
a
nip
of
the
same
an
if
elbert
was
blind
as
well
an
if
wore
any
clothes
besides
wings
the
funny
thing
was
thet
elbert
did
bad
sight
it
always
seemed
odd
to
me
thet
with
weak
eyes
should
choose
to
play
the
little
game
did
i
use
to
take
to
the
of
a
summer
sunday
an
use
to
stand
on
them
little
ridges
below
the
spaniards
road
with
eyes
shut
against
the
sun
never
botherin
to
take
no
aim
i
can
see
now
of
the
string
of
bow
it
an
note
like
the
beginnin
of
a
bit
o
music
an
then
awf
go
like
a
rebbit
to
see
where
the
arrer
fell
it
was
always
a
marvel
to
me
did
put
somebody
eye
out
but
i
did
mind
i
everybody
did
live
with
me
just
came
in
an
out
never
tol
me
name
was
elbert
i
just
called
thet
the
prettiest
name
i
knew
never
tol
me
people
were
i
should
think
they
could
bin
brown
borough
people
for
elbert
seemed
to
bin
about
a
lot
seen
mountains
an
oceans
an
sichlike
an
come
acrost
a
lot
of
furriners
even
germans
talked
a
lot
about
people
as
good
as
a
novelette
stories
was
but
bloody
children
knows
a
lot
in
the
brown
borough
noticed
the
things
with
them
blindish
eyes
of
i
do
know
i
got
to
count
on
that
boy
no
end
fair
drunk
with
satisfaction
i
use
to
feel
call
me
a
fool
if
you
like
cully
but
it
was
three
or
four
year
before
i
got
the
idee
that
there
was
anythink
funny
about
elbert
it
was
when
it
begun
to
look
as
if
the
war
come
to
stop
an
one
could
look
at
any
boy
without
up
to
see
long
before
the
army
copped
an
then
i
that
elbert
should
be
rising
fourteen
now
an
i
saw
then
thet
grown
an
inch
since
i
first
see
nor
changed
ways
but
still
run
about
laughin
playin
little
with
face
to
the
sun
an
then
i
remembered
often
tol
me
things
thet
seemed
too
for
sich
as
to
come
by
honest
tales
about
blokes
in
nanecdotes
use
to
pass
acrost
about
admiral
nelson
or
queen
bess
she
use
to
make
chuckle
she
did
an
a
chap
called
shilly
or
shally
was
drownded
an
i
got
struck
all
of
an
to
think
was
some
sort
of
an
everlasting
boy
an
was
a
devil
i
thought
an
i
sold
me
soul
without
knowin
it
i
never
took
much
stock
of
me
soul
but
i
always
that
debt
o
mine
in
me
mind
an
i
wanted
to
pay
it
clean
for
them
london
mists
agin
the
sky
in
the
spring
an
for
the
moonlight
an
for
the
sky
just
before
a
thunderstorm
all
them
things
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
same
box
like
an
i
did
like
feelin
as
they
was
all
jest
charity
i
got
this
idee
about
elbert
an
i
sleep
a
wink
thet
night
an
could
enjoy
me
starlight
in
the
come
as
usual
with
pretty
blind
smile

softening
in

an
one
of
the

village

moor

a
mile
out

like
in
between
the
moor
an
the
sea
there
was
the
beach
it
looked
like
a
blessed
boundary
road
between
two
countries
an
it
led
away
to
where
you
could
see
nothing
more
except
a
little
white
town
sort
of
built
upon
a
mist
more
like
a
star
oh
gawd
anyway
cuffbut

she

naturalist
would
speak
of
a
new
animal
gradually
finding
out
the
pretty
and
amusing
ways
of
the
creature
i
called
sherrie
because
thet
what

a
french
word
it
was
ses
meaning

a
reel

bullet
that

a
magic

said
sarah
brown
it
springtime
now
repeated
peony
ow
it
wonderful
seems
like
as
if
i

too
much
given

so
as
i
can
never
repay
but
keepin
count
i
not
forgettin
it
ai
long
now
before
i
pay
my
debt
come
the
middle
o
may
chapter
iv
the
forbidden
sandwich
while
sarah
brown
unenviable
leisure
was
spent
in
acting
as
slave
to
committees
she
had
at
the
same
time
a
profession
which
when
she
was
well
enough
to
follow
it
brought
twenty
shillings
a
week
to
her
pocket
she
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
every
morning
in
a
small
office
collecting
evidence
from
charitable
spies
about
the
naughty
poor
and
after
wrapping
the
evidence
in
mysterious
ciphers
writing
it
down
very
beautifully
upon
little
cards
so
that
the
next
spy
might
have
the
benefit
of
all
his
forerunners
experience
sarah
brown
never
thought
about
the
theory
of
this
work
because
the
different
coloured
inks
and
the
beautiful
writing
pleased
her
so
there
are
people
to
whom
a
ream
of
virgin
paper
is
an
inspiration
who
find
the
first
sharpening
of
a
pencil
the
most
lovable
of
all
labours
who
see
something
almost
holy
in
the
dedication
of
green
and
red
penholders
to
their
appropriate
inks
in
whose
ears
and
before
whose
eyes
the
alphabet
is
like
a
poem
or
a
prayer
touch
on
stationery
and
you
touched
an
insane
spot
in
sarah
brown
mind
her
dream
of
a
perfect
old
age
was
staged
in
a
stationer
shop
in
a
quiet
brown
street
there
she
would
spend
twilit
days
in
stroking
thick
in
drawing
dogs
all
looking
one
way
with
new
in
giving
advice
in
a
hushed
voice
to
connoisseur
customers
who
should
come
to
buy
a
diary
or
a
or
a
with
the
same
reverence
as
they
now
show
who
come
to
buy
old
wine
therefore
sarah
brown
hand
had
found
ideal
employment
on
a
charity
register
as
for
her
mind
it
usually
shut
its
eye
during
office
hours
her
dog
david
liked
the
work
too
as
the
was
a
comfortable
one
and
charity
though
it
may
suffer
long
in
other
directions
is
rather
particular
about
its
firing
on
the
monday
after
her
change
of
home
sarah
brown
found
that
the
glory
had
gone
out
of
the
varied
inks
and
even
a
new
consignment
of
exquisitely
unspotted
from
the
world
failed
to
arouse
her
enthusiasm
this
was
partly
because
the
first
name
in
the
index
that
she
looked
up
was
that
of
watkins
thelma
bennett
single
machinist
the
ciphers
informed
the
initiated
that
watkins
had
called
on
the
war
association
to
ask
for
help
and
advice
see
full
report
sarah
brown
felt
sad
and
clumsy
and
made
two
blots
one
in
green
on
the
watkins
card
and
the
other
in
ordinary
on
the
card
of
one
tonk
single
to
whom
a
certain
charity
was
obstinately
giving
a
of
milk
daily
regardless
of
the
fact
that
last
month
she
had
received
a
of
groceries
from
the
parish
the
air
of
that
office
rang
with
the
name
of
tonk
that
morning
hardly
had
the
industrious
sarah
brown
finished
turning
the
blot
upon
her
card
into
the
silhouette
of
a
dromedary
by
a
few
ingenious
strokes
of
the
pen
when
the
lady
representing
the
obstinate
charity
came
in
her
lips
shaped
to
the
word
tonk
tonk
she
said
late
of
mud
street
she
has
changed
her
address
i
am
the
guild
of
happy
hearts
she
still
comes
to
fetch
her
of
milk
daily
and
only
yesterday
i
learnt
from
a
neighbour
that
she
had
left
mud
street
three
weeks
ago
it
really
is
disgraceful
the
way
these
poor
people
conceal
important
facts
from
us
have
you
her
new
address
our
last
address
for
tonk
was
mud
street
answered
sarah
brown
coldly
but
we
have
already
notified
you
three
times
that
the
woman
is
not
entitled
to
milk
from
the
happy
hearts
as
she
has
been
having
parish
relief
as
well
as
an
allotment
tonk
is
hm
hm
said
the
happy
heart
delicately
in
an
undertone
so
that
the
blushing
masculine
ear
of
the
dog
david
might
be
spared
after
baby
week
you
know
we
feel
bound
to
help
all
hm
hm
women
as
far
as
we
can
regardless
of
other
considerations
really
you
ought
to
tonk
is
posing
as
a
single
sarah
brown
was
rapidly
becoming
exasperated
with
everybody
concerned
but
not
least
with
the
evidently
camouflaging
tonk
she
has
a
soldier
at
the
front
said
the
happy
heart
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
she
will
not
promise
to
marry
him
even
if
he
does
come
home
but
even
so
sarah
brown
wrote
down
on
miss
tonk
card
the
small
purple
cipher
that
stood
for
hm
hm
i
will
make
enquiries
about
her
address
she
said
but
that
was
not
the
last
of
tonk
presently
the
red
face
of
the
relieving
officer
loomed
over
the
index
in
the
case
of
plummett
he
began
loudly
in
the
case
of
tonk
interrupted
sarah
brown
to
whom
in
her
present
mood
plummett
could
only
have
been
a
last
straw
she
hated
the
relieving
officer
unjustly
because
he
knew
she
was
deaf
and
raised
his
voice
with
the
best
intentions
to
such
a
degree
that
the
case
papers
on
the
index
were
occasionally
blown
away
we
have
already
notified
you
three
times
that
tonk
is
having
a
of
milk
daily
from
the
happy
hearts
as
well
as
an
allotment
from
a
soldier
we
stopped
the
groceries
roared
the
relieving
officer
but
in
the
case
of
plummett
in
the
case
of
tonk
persisted
sarah
brown
she
has
moved
from
mud
street
can
you
tell
me
her
last
address
she
is
living
in
a
sort
of
private
charitable
institution
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
the
district
mitten
island
i
fancy
i
do
know
the
exact
address
because
we
have
stopped
the
groceries
she
paying
no
rent
now
in
the
case
of
plummett
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
to
know
that
she
got
a
month
this
morning
for
assaulting
the
sanitary
inspector
pulling
his
nose
i
hear
she
told
the
magistrate
it
struck
her
as
being
a
useless
nose
if
it
did
notice
anything
wrong
with
her
drains
the
children
came
into
the
house
this
morning
what
is
tonk
christian
name
asked
sarah
brown
who
had
been
a
changed
woman
since
mitten
island
was
mentioned
i
forget
some
flower
name
i
think
probably
lily
or
ivy
in
the
case
of
the
woman
is
said
to
have
fallen
through
a
hole
in
the
floor
of
the
room
she
and
her
three
children
slept
in
she
was
admitted
into
the
infirmary
last
night
and
her
furniture
will
be
sold
to
pay
her
rent
it
begins
with
p
said
sarah
brown
tonk
unmarried
wife
of
mitten
island
the
relieving
officer
went
away
for
it
was
sarah
brown
absently
unwrapped
the
little
dinner
which
she
had
brought
hanging
by
a
thin
string
from
a
strangled
finger
mustard
sandwiches
with
just
a
flavouring
of
ham
and
a
painfully
orthodox
bun
made
of
stubble
sarah
brown
almost
always
forgot
the
necessity
of
food
until
she
was
irrevocably
in
the
on
her
way
to
work
but
this
morning
as
she
had
taken
her
seat
with
david
in
the
bouncing
there
had
been
a
panting
rustling
noise
behind
her
and
harold
the
broomstick
had
swept
a
little
packet
of
sandwiches
into
her
lap
he
had
disappeared
before
she
had
been
able
to
do
more
than
turn
over
in
her
mind
the
question
whether
or
no
broomsticks
ever
expect
to
be
tipped
now
i
could
not
say
with
certainty
whether
the
witch
in
making
up
this
packet
of
sandwiches
had
included
the
contents
of
one
of
her
own
little
packets
of
magic
sarah
brown
would
have
been
very
susceptible
to
such
a
drug
her
mind
was
always
on
the
brink
of
innocent
intoxication
perhaps
she
was
only
half
a
woman
so
that
half
a
joy
could
make
her
heart
reel
and
sing
and
half
a
sorrow
break
it
she
was
defenceless
against
impressions
and
too
many
impressions
make
the
heart
very
tired
therefore
i
think
she
was
a
predestined
victim
of
magic
and
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
witch
should
have
missed
such
an
opportunity
to
dispense
spells
after
the
first
bite
at
the
first
sandwich
sarah
brown
was
conscious
of
a
joke
somewhere
this
feeling
in
itself
was
akin
to
delirium
for
there
are
no
two
facts
so
remote
as
a
joke
and
a
charity
society
the
office
table
confronted
sarah
brown
and
she
wondered
that
she
could
ever
have
seen
it
as
anything
but
a
butt
she
wondered
how
she
had
been
able
to
sit
daily
in
front
of
that
stout
and
earnest
index
without
poking
it
in
the
ribs
and
making
a
fool
of
it
the
office
clock
alone
among
clocks
had
never
played
a
practical
joke
the
sad
fire
below
it
conscious
of
a
mission
was
overloaded
with
coal
and
responsibility
the
second
bite
ten
minutes
later
caused
sarah
brown
to
be
tired
and
distrustful
of
a
room
that
had
no
smile
her
eyes
turned
to
seek
the
hidden
joke
beyond
the
limits
of
that
lamentable
room
there
was
a
tree
in
the
opposite
and
above
the
tree
a
rough
blue
and
silver
sky
contradicted
all
the
doctrines
preached
in
offices
there
was
in
the
wind
something
of
the
old
raw
simplicity
and
mirth
that
always
haunts
the
sea
and
penetrates
inland
only
on
rare
spring
days
the
high
white
clouds
crossed
the
sky
like
galleons
like
old
stories
out
of
the
innocent
past
of
the
sea
before
she
learnt
the
ways
of
steam
and
secret
killing
old
names
of
ships
came
to
sarah
brown
mind
i
am
doing
wrong
said
sarah
brown
she
took
a
third
bite
and
then
she
felt
the
spirit
of
the
naughty
poor
in
the
room
there
was
laughter
as
of
the
registered
in
the
ears
of
the
registrar
it
is
not
really
permissible
for
the
naughty
poor
to
invade
offices
which
exist
to
do
them
good
the
way
of
charity
lies
through
suspicion
but
the
suspicion
of
course
must
be
all
on
one
side
we
have
to
judge
the
criminal
unheard
if
we
called
him
as
a
witness
in
his
case
we
might
become
sentimental
the
charity
society
may
be
imagined
as
keeping
two
lists
of
crimes
a
short
one
for
registrars
and
workers
and
a
very
long
one
for
the
registered
high
on
the
list
of
crimes
possible
to
registrars
and
workers
is
sentimentality
it
is
sentimental
to
feel
personal
affection
for
a
case
or
to
give
a
child
of
the
naughty
poor
a
penny
without
full
enquiry
or
to
say
to
a
grey
pensive
baby
eating
dirt
on
the
pavement
or
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
a
case
to
ask
questions
sometimes
instead
of
answering
them
or
to
disapprove
of
spying
and
or
to
believe
any
statement
made
by
any
one
without
an
assured
income
or
to
quote
any
part
of
the
new
testament
or
in
fact
to
confuse
in
any
way
the
ideas
of
charity
and
love
christ
who
by
the
way
unfortunately
omitted
to
join
any
reputable
philanthropic
society
commanded
seekers
of
salvation
to
be
poor
and
to
despise
themselves
but
this
was
sentimental
and
the
charity
society
decrees
that
only
the
prosperous
and
the
shall
deserve
a
hearing
i
am
sentimental
said
sarah
brown
to
her
dog
david
in
a
broken
voice
she
turned
again
to
her
enchanted
sandwich
there
was
increased
laughter
in
the
air
and
through
it
she
heard
the
hoarse
and
happy
shouting
of
the
sparrows
in
the
tree
opposite
sparrows
are
the
ideal
naughty
poor
the
begging
friars
the
gypsies
of
the
air
they
claim
alms
as
a
right
and
as
a
seal
of
friendship
with
their
mouths
full
of
your
crumbs
they
share
with
you
their
innocent
and
vulgar
wit
they
give
you
in
return
no
and
no
particulars
for
your
when
they
have
got
from
you
all
that
you
will
give
they
wink
and
giggle
and
shake
the
dust
of
your
from
off
their
feet
sarah
brown
opened
the
office
window
and
the
air
of
the
office
began
at
once
to
dance
with
life
and
the
noise
of
children
and
birds
she
thought
perhaps
these
were
magic
noises
for
she
heard
them
so
clearly
she
broke
her
second
sandwich
upon
the
and
the
sparrows
crossed
the
street
and
stood
on
the
area
railing
in
a
row
below
her
all
speaking
at
once
in
an
effort
to
convey
to
her
the
fact
that
a
retreat
on
her
part
would
be
tactful
the
sparrow
obviously
buys
all
his
clothes
probably
at
jumble
sales
and
he
always
seems
to
choose
clothes
made
for
a
stouter
bird
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
never
look
chic
he
has
a
slimmer
figure
than
the
bullfinch
for
instance
who
always
manages
to
look
so
it
is
just
arrogance
pure
londonism
on
the
part
of
the
sparrow
just
that
impudent
socialistic
spirit
that
makes
it
so
difficult
for
us
to
reform
the
naughty
poor
sarah
brown
retreated
one
step
i
not
going
farther
away
either
you
eat
that
sandwich
with
me
looking
on
or
you
leave
it
the
sparrows
whispered
together
for
a
moment
saying
to
each
other
you
go
first
they
obviously
knew
that
it
was
a
charity
and
were
afraid
sarah
brown
might
intend
to
rebuke
them
for
not
shutting
their
beaks
while
chewing
or
for
neglecting
to
put
any
crumbs
into
the
savings
bank
but
after
a
minute
one
sparrow
moistened
his
beak
and
came
he
ate
they
all
ate
and
did
not
seek
to
escape
as
the
door
of
the
office
opened
and
the
witch
came
in
she
went
straight
to
the
window
and
picked
up
from
among
the
stooping
sparrows
a
piece
of
the
broken
sandwich
and
ate
it
the
dog
david
was
making
sure
that
there
was
no
surviving
crumb
on
the
floor
to
tell
the
tale
of
his
sentimental
weakness
almost
instantly
therefore
that
sandwich
was
but
a
memory
a
fading
taste
in
about
twenty
beaks
and
two
mouths
but
still
the
window
stood
open
and
the
air
danced
and
the
white
reflections
of
the
clouds
lay
on
the
oilcloth
floor
sarah
brown
in
the
meanwhile
disregarding
the
witch
had
returned
to
the
index
and
had
taken
from
its
drawer
a
notification
form
in
the
space
given
for
name
of
case
she
had
written
in
her
irreproachable
printing
hand
charity
cautionary
case
pan
street
brown
borough
with
reference
to
the
above
case
i
have
to
report
that
it
seems
unsatisfactory
there
are
indeed
grave
suspicions
that
the
above
name
is
only
an
alias
the
address
being
also
probably
false
for
the
genuine
charity
place
of
origin
is
said
to
be
the
home
rather
than
the
office
the
present
registrar
is
at
a
loss
to
identify
with
certainty
this
case
it
would
seem
to
be
one
of
the
habits
that
haunt
the
world
collecting
kudos
under
assumed
names
it
puzzles
me
said
the
witch
looking
out
of
the
window
why
one
never
sees
two
birds
collide
if
there
were
as
many
witches
in
the
air
as
there
are
birds
i
bet
you
twopence
there
would
be
constant
accidents
do
you
think
they
have
any
sort
of
a
rule
of
the
road
or
do
they
indicate
with
their
beaks
witch
said
sarah
brown
i
have
got
to
say
something
oh
have
you
said
the
witch
a
little
disappointed
at
being
interrupted
oh
well
i
can
sympathise
i
know
what
that
feels
like
get
on
and
say
it
the
dog
david
who
was
really
a
good
and
attentive
son
to
sarah
brown
came
and
laid
his
chin
with
an
exaggerated
look
of
interest
on
her
is
it
any
use
said
sarah
brown
fighting
against
the
habits
in
the
world
there
are
so
many
who
set
these
strange
and
senseless
deceivers
at
large
religion
which
has
forgotten
ecstasy
law
which
has
forgotten
justice
charity
which
has
forgotten
love
surely
magic
has
suffered
at
the
stake
for
saner
ideals
than
these
why
of
course
said
the
witch
impatiently
magic
generally
suffered
it
was
so
sane
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
all
habits
all
habits
chanted
sarah
brown
what
is
this
charity
this
clinking
of
money
between
strangers
and
when
did
charity
cease
to
be
a
comforting
and
secret
thing
between
one
friend
and
another
does
love
make
her
voice
heard
through
a
committee
does
love
employ
an
almoner
to
convey
her
message
to
her
neighbour
not
that
i
know
of
sighed
the
witch
sarah
brown
how
long
do
you
want
me
to
keep
quiet
while
you
say
things
that
everybody
surely
knows
but
sarah
brown
went
on
the
real
love
knows
her
neighbour
face
to
face
and
laughs
with
him
and
weeps
with
him
and
eats
and
drinks
with
him
so
that
at
last
when
his
black
day
dawns
she
may
share
with
him
not
what
she
can
spare
but
all
that
she
has
the
dog
david
grunted
a
little
by
way
of
rather
dubious
applause
sarah
brown
with
her
own
voice
printed
loud
and
stark
upon
the
retina
of
her
hearing
felt
a
little
abashed
but
presently
she
added
in
a
whisper
listen
i
am
a
spy
i
am
a
lover
of
specially
recommended
neighbours
only
i
am
here
to
help
to
give
the
black
cloud
tyranny
a
rather
dirty
silver
lining
i
am
the
false
steward
in
the
interest
of
the
superfluously
comfortable
my
masters
sit
upon
the
king
highway
taking
toll
in
bitterness
and
humiliation
from
every
traveller
along
that
road
for
surely
comfort
is
every
man
heritage
surely
the
happy
years
should
come
to
every
man
not
doled
out
not
meanly
dependent
on
his
moral
orthodoxy
but
as
his
right
the
fat
philanthropist
is
a
debtor
but
he
behaves
like
a
creditor
he
distributes
obligations
with
his
gold
yet
he
has
no
right
to
the
gold
he
gives
he
makes
his
brother
beg
upon
his
knees
for
the
life
and
the
health
and
the
dear
opportunity
that
should
have
been
that
brother
birthright
you
are
possessed
dear
sarah
brown
said
the
witch
do
be
frightened
it
will
soon
pass
off
i
knew
a
girl
who
had
an
attack
very
much
like
this
while
she
was
under
its
influence
she
made
up
a
psalm
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
one
of
david
her
mother
was
much
alarmed
about
her
but
she
recovered
quite
quickly
except
that
she
left
her
job
as
typist
in
a
institute
and
went
to
sea
as
a
stewardess
sarah
brown
talked
on
louder
and
louder
too
long
i
have
been
a
servant
in
the
house
of
this
stranger
this
greedy
charity
too
long
have
i
sat
a
silly
proxy
for
the
in
this
narrow
from
ten
till
three
daily
there
is
love
and
april
outside
the
window
there
is
too
much
wind
and
laughter
outside
to
allow
of
the
forming
of
habits
i
have
seen
love
and
the
spring
only
through
the
glass
of
a
charity
office
window
the
rude
voices
of
children
and
sparrows
and
other
inheritors
of
opportunity
have
been
dulled
for
me
by
grey
panes
the
white
ships
have
sailed
into
port
from
the
open
sky
without
a
cargo
for
me
good
god
said
sarah
brown
pushing
david
from
her
what
has
happened
to
me
i
have
become
sentimental
the
room
seemed
to
her
wild
imagination
to
be
full
of
the
spirits
of
parsons
and
social
workers
with
flaming
swords
pointing
at
the
door
well
that
the
end
of
that
job
said
the
witch
i
tell
you
what
let
go
and
sit
on
the
seat
on
the
heath
the
air
there
and
the
look
of
harrow
church
steeple
do
you
good
i
am
damned
i
am
a
cautionary
case
cried
sarah
brown
and
she
slunk
behind
the
witch
through
the
frowning
gate
of
her
eden
of
fair
inks
and
smooth
white
surfaces
she
had
shared
with
david
the
remains
of
her
sandwich
of
knowledge
she
had
left
on
the
table
her
puny
paper
defiance
david
except
that
he
had
required
but
little
temptation
had
played
adam
part
very
creditably
in
the
affair
for
him
eden
had
been
a
soft
warm
place
and
he
was
anxious
to
blame
somebody
the
woman
for
choice
for
the
loss
of
his
comfort
he
followed
her
out
into
the
cold
to
become
as
you
shall
hear
like
adam

tiller

chapter

from

magic
is
a
disconcerting
travelling
companion
while
seldom
actually
conspicuous
it
seems
to
have
a
mysterious
and
varying
effect
on
the
surrounding
public
i
have
met
travellers
by
tube
who
tell
of
strange
doings
in
those
regions
when
the
conductor
of
one
compartment
fell
suddenly
in
love
with
the
conductress
of
the
next
and
they
ran
to
each
other
and
met
in
the
middle
of
the
car
as
nobody
opened
the
gates
or
rang
the
bells
the
bewildered
train
stood
for
hours
at
mornington
crescent
before
any
member
of
the
watching
public
could
find
the
heart
to
interrupt
the
pretty
scene
it
is
patent
that
a
magic
person
must
have
been
the
more
or
less
deliberate
cause
of
this
episode
then
again
there
is
the
story
of
the
that
went
mad
just
as
it
was
leaving
its
burrow
at
dalston
it
got
the
idea
that
the
kindly
public
was
its
enemy
you
should
have
seen
the
astonishment
of
liverpool
street
and
the
bank
as
it
rushed
by
them
old
ladies
about
to
ask
it
whether
it
went
to
clapham
its
label
said
it
was
bound
for
barnes
stood
aghast
and
their
questions
died
on
their
lips
policemen
put
up
their
hands
against
it
it
ran
over
them
it
even
learned
the
trick
of
avoiding
the
nimble
business
man
by
a
cunning
little
skid
just
as
he
thought
he
had
caught
it
you
will
hardly
believe
me
but
that
ran
seven
times
round
trafalgar
square
until
the
lions
tails
twisted
for
giddiness
and
nelson
reeled
where
he
stood
i
do
know
where
it
went
to
that
day
certainly
not
to
barnes
but
late
in
the
evening
it
burst
into
another
burrow
at
tooting
its
sides
heaving
its
tyres
worn
to
the
quick
its
windows
streaming
with
perspiration
and
a
great
bruise
on
its
forehead
where
a
chance
bomb
had
struck
it
i
believe
the
poor
thing
had
to
be
put
out
of
its
misery
in
the
end
and
what
was
the
reason
of
all
this
it
was
found
that
a
wizard
called
innocent
of
stoke
newington
had
been
asleep
on
the
top
all
the
time
having
forgotten
to
alight
the
night
before
on
his
return
from
the
city
sarah
brown
on
the
night
of
lady
arabel
supper
party
was
unaware
of
the
risk
she
ran
in
entering
a
public
conveyance
in
company
with
a
witch
but
she
was
spared
to
a
merciful
extent
for
nothing
happened
on
any
of
the
they
boarded
except
that
as
they
crossed
the
canal
a
cloud
of
swooped
and
swirled
into
the
resting
awhile
on
the
passengers
willing
shoulders
before
disappearing
again
also
the
passengers
on
the
baker
street
stretch
sang
all
the
way
down
to
selfridge
the
conductor
turned
out
to
have
rather
a
pleasing
tenor
voice
the
witch
and
sarah
brown
knocked
at
the
higgins
door
five
minutes
before
lady
arabel
herself
opened
it
my
dears
is
it
too
dretful
all
our
servants
are
gone
it
an
extraordinary
thing
they
never
can
stand
rrchud
and
his
ways
the
tactful
sarah
brown
nudged
the
witch
better
not
stay
she
murmured
of
course
we
stay
replied
the
witch
loudly
i
horribly
hungry
and
there
sure
to
be
some
supper
certainly
there
is
added
lady
arabel
i
cooked
it
myself
do
you
know
i
never
seen
a
cookery
book
before
and
the
little
pictures
of
animals
with
the
names
of
joints
written
all
over
them
shocked
me
dretfully
i
feel
i
could
have
a
too
deliciously
intimate
conversation
with
a
bullock
now
the
house
of
higgins
had
an
enormous
hall
to
which
a
large
number
of
high
windows
gave
the
impression
of
a
squint
i
should
think
two
small
zeppelins
could
have
danced
a
minuet
under
its
dome
sarah
brown
and
the
witch
put
on
their
cathedral
look
at
once
by
mistake
and
propping
their
chins
upon
their
umbrellas
gazed
reverently
upward
too
dretful
a
house
of
this
size
without
servants
said
lady
arabel
the
fourth
footman
was
the
last
to
go
he
said
even
the
army
would
be
better
than
this
he
liked
spooks
he
said
at
second
hand
but
not
otherwise
too
funny
how
people
take
dear
rrchud
seriously
i
glad
to
say
the
orchestra
has
stayed
with
us
come
into
rrchud
study
you
while
i
just
go
and
help
the
first
violin
to
dish
up
the
soup
sarah
brown
and
the
witch
were
left
in
a
small
room
that
opened
on
to
the
great
hall
it
was
furnished
rather
like
a
parlour
there
was
a
thermometer
elaborately
disguised
as
a
model
of
the
eddystone
lighthouse
on
the
mantelpiece
flanked
on
each
side
by
a
china
boot
in
pink
with
real
bootlaces
and
a
pig
looking
out
of
the
top
of
each
there
were
pictures
on
the
walls
mostly
representing
young
ladies
more
or
less
obviously
in
love
supported
by
rustic
properties
i
have
noticed
that
the
girl
first
love
is
the
monopoly
of
the
victorian
painter
whereas
the
boy
is
that
of
the
novelist
but
i
do
not
know
the
reason
of
this
there
was
a
slight
clap
of
thunder
and
richard
entered
he
would
have
been
very
obviously
a
wizard
even
without
the
thunder
and
seemed
much
less
innocent
about
his
magic
than
the
witch
he
had
pale
hair
a
pale
face
and
eyes
that
did
not
open
wide
without
a
certain
effort
on
the
part
of
the
brows
you
are
despising
my
ornaments
he
said
to
sarah
brown
i
admire
them
awfully
i
do
like
really
clever
art
do
you
know
it
makes
me
sneeze
directly
he
spoke
one
saw
that
he
was
making
the
usual
effort
of
magic
to
appear
real
witches
and
wizards
lead
difficult
lives
because
they
have
no
ancestry
working
within
them
to
prompt
them
in
the
little
details
whenever
you
see
a
person
being
unusually
suspect
them
of
magic
you
can
always
notice
witches
and
wizards
for
instance
after
eight
at
night
pretending
that
they
are
not
proud
of
sitting
up
late
it
is
all
nonsense
about
witches
being
night
birds
they
often
fly
about
at
night
indeed
but
only
because
they
are
like
permanent
children
gloriously
escaped
for
ever
from
their
nanas
this
picture
added
richard
seems
to
me
very
beautiful
the
picture
might
have
cost
a
shilling
originally
framed
or
it
might
have
been
attached
to
a
calendar
once
it
was
a
landscape
so
thick
in
colouring
and
so
lightless
that
it
failed
to
give
an
outdoor
impression
at
all
there
was
a
river
and
waterfall
like
hair
in
the
middle
and
a
dozen
leaden
mountains
lying
about
with
apparently
on
their
tops
and
a
stag
drinking
i
ca
imagine
insisted
richard
that
there
could
be
a
more
beautiful
picture
than
that
but
perhaps
it
appeals
to
me
specially
because
father
and
mother
and
i
so
often
talk
about
the
place
together
the
place
like
that
near
to
the
mountain
where
i
was
born
that
was
in
the
rockies
you
know
and
just
below
our
mountain
i
am
sure
there
was
a
canyon
like
that
i
dream
of
it
with
water
running
under
and
over
and
round
the
most
extraordinary
shapes
of
ice
and
cactuses
like
green
hedgehogs
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
and
great
untidy
clinging
to
an
ounce
of
earth
on
an
inch
of
flat
surface
and
the
rocks
are
a
most
splendid
and
lie
in
steep
layers
and
break
out
into
shapes
that
are
so
deliberate
they
look
as
if
they
must
mean
something
indeed
they
do
a
stave
played
by
a
called
them
to
supper
and
as
they
returned
to
the
hall
a
burst
of
earnest
music
from
the
whole
orchestra
partially
drowned
the
clap
of
thunder
that
again
marked
richard
passage
through
the
door
sarah
brown
felt
sure
that
lady
arabel
arranged
this
on
purpose
the
wizard
mother
obviously
had
great
difficulty
in
not
noticing
the
phenomena
connected
with
her
son
and
she
wore
a
striving
smile
and
a
look
of
glassy
and
unconsciousness
whenever
anything
magic
happened
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
orchestra
arranged
neatly
in
a
crescent
was
busily
employing
its
violins
in
a
unanimous
melody
of
so
rude
and
destructive
a
nature
that
it
seemed
as
if
every
string
must
be
broken
this
mania
spread
until
even
the
outlying
bassoons
triangles
and
celestas
were
infected
a
piercing
note
of
command
however
from
a
clarinet
caused
a
devastating
dumbness
to
fall
suddenly
on
every
instrument
except
the
piano
which
continued
alone
the
pianist
looked
at
the
ceiling
mostly
but
one
note
seemed
to
be
an
especial
favourite
with
him
and
whenever
he
played
it
he
looked
closely
and
paternally
at
it
almost
indeed
applying
his
nose
to
it
all
at
once
just
as
sarah
brown
was
beginning
to
imagine
that
she
could
catch
the
tune
and
the
time
the
music
ceased
apparently
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
richard
sneezed
once
or
twice
that
unsophisticated
wizard
was
evidently
enjoying
himself
in
the
practice
of
his
art
one
felt
that
magic
was
not
encouraged
in
the
army
and
that
the
supernatural
orgy
in
which
he
was
now
indulging
was
the
accumulated
reaction
after
long
strange
noises
of
unnatural
laughter
for
instance
proceeded
from
distant
corners
of
the
hall
and
each
of
the
electric
lights
in
turn
winked
facetiously
the
string
of
the
double
bass
broke
loudly
and
the
new
string
which
its
devotee
laboriously
inserted
also
broke
at
once
the
performer
looked
appealingly
at
lady
arabel
but
she
refrained
from
meeting
his
eye
a
blizzard
of
butterflies
enveloped
the
table
this
was
evidently
rather
a
difficult
trick
for
the
spell
collapsed
repeatedly
and
from
one
second
to
another
sarah
brown
was
never
quite
sure
whether
there
were
really
purple
admirals
drowning
in
her
soup
or
not
you
are
so
lucky
sighed
the
witch
plenty
of
room
and
every
facility
i
myself
am
so
dreadfully
cramped
and
hampered
i
often
have
to
boil
my
incantations
over
a
spirit
lamp
and
even
that
is
becoming
difficult
no
methylated
not
really
lucky
said
richard
in
france
the
smallest
pinch
of
magic
seems
to
make
the
sick
and
that
why
i
never
got
my
stripe
to
keep
my
hand
in
i
once
did
a
little
stunt
with
the
cigarette
it
grew
suddenly
longer
as
he
struck
a
match
to
light
it
and
went
on
growing
till
he
had
to
ask
me
to
light
it
for
him
and
then
it
shrank
up
and
burnt
his
nose
of
course
he
could
really
bring
the
thing
home
to
me
but
somehow
well
as
i
say
i
never
got
my
stripe
to
this
discussion
and
indeed
to
all
the
enchantments
lady
arabel
paid
no
attention
but
continued
to
talk
a
little
nervously
on
very
insipid
subjects
her
eyes
had
the
pathetic
look
often
seen
in
stupid
eyes
the
look
i
am
not
saying
what
i
should
like
to
say
the
real
me
is
better
than
this
finally
richard
indulged
in
a
trick
that
was
evidently
a
stock
joke
among
magic
people
for
the
witch
laughed
directly
it
began
just
as
the
hostess
with
poised
fork
and
spoon
was
about
to
distribute
the
whitebait
the
round
table
began
to
spin
and
the
whitebait
were
whisked
away
from
her
the
table
continued
to
spin
for
a
moment
with
a
deep
thrilling
organ
sound
and
when
it
stopped
the
whitebait
were
found
to
have
assembled
opposite
to
richard
place
he
distributed
them
gravely
lady
arabel
turned
scarlet
and
murmured
to
sarah
brown
so
dretfully
ingenious
and
so
merry
sarah
brown
took
pity
on
her
and
began
talking
at
random
the
orchestra
was
busy
again
and
to
the
tune
of
a
loud
elusive
she
shouted
do
you
know
i
gave
my
job
the
sack
this
morning
i
shall
be
on
the
brink
of
starvation
in
three
and
a
half
days
time
that
counting
a
box
of
oxo
cubes
i
have
by
me
you
do
happen
to
know
of
a
suitable
job
i
ca
cook
and
if
i
sew
a
button
on
it
comes
off
quicker
than
if
i
had
but
i
once
learnt
to
play
the
big
drum
my
dear
said
lady
arabel
instantly
motherly
how
too
dretful
i
wish
i
knew
of
something
suitable
but
you
know
i
afraid
i
sha
be
justified
in
keeping
on
the
orchestra
certainly
not
in
adding
to
it
besides
of
course
although
women
are
simply
too
splendid
nowadays
do
you
think
the
big
drum
just
a
wee
bit
unwomanly
my
dear
however
are
you
clever
asked
richard
yes
she
is
said
the
witch
proudly
she
writes
minor
poetry
i
saw
a
bit
by
her
in
a
magazine
that
had
no
pictures
the
bit
of
poetry
was
between
an
article
on
tariff
reform
and
a
statement
of
the
coal
situation
and
it
began
my
beloved
i
thought
it
was
a
very
beautiful
bit
of
minor
poetry
but
somehow
i
could
make
it
fit
in
with
the
two
articles
that
worried
me
a
little
if
you
try
your
best
not
to
be
clever
i
give
you
a
job
said
richard
who
with
a
rather
tiresome
persistence
was
now
levitating
the
chicken
so
that
invisibly
suspended
at
a
height
of
eighteen
inches
above
the
middle
of
the
table
it
dripped
gravy
into
a
bowl
of
daffodils
in
fact
i
will
give
you
a
job
i
have
a
farm
called
higgins
farm
just
about
between
and
you
can
be
a
hand
if
you
like
at
sixpence
an
hour
you
can
get
there
from
mitten
island
every
day
quite
easily
and
i
tell
you
how
it
just
the
other
side
of
the
parish
of
faery
on
your
right
as
you
reach
the
mainland
from
mitten
island
you
follow
the
green
ride
through
the
enchanted
forest
until
you
come
to
the
castle
where
the
youngest
prince
who
rescued
one
of
the
fetherstonhaugh
girls
from
a
giant
and
married
her
used
to
live
the
castle
to
let
now
she
is
an
ambulance
driver
in
salonika
and
he
a
gunner
just
got
his
battery
i
believe
below
the
outer
wall
of
the
castle
you
will
see
the
daisified
path
and
that
leads
you
straight
to
the
gate
of
higgins
farm
under
a
clipped
box
archway
i
have
got
a
land
outfit
said
sarah
brown
but
i
saw
a
pair
called
mesopotamian
officer
model
with
laces
and
real
white
buckskin
collision
mats
between
the
knees
that
would
fit
me
and
i
can
pawn
my
at
that
moment
there
was
a
loud
report
every
one
looked
at
the
double
bass
but
all
his
strings
were
for
the
moment
intact
a
maroon
said
the
witch
my
dears
exclaimed
lady
arabel
much
relieved
to
hear
that
this
new
sensation
was
not
supernatural
how
too
dretfully
tahsome
with
the
sweet
and
the
savoury
still
to
come
do
you
know
i
promised
pinehurst
my
husband
never
to
remain
in
this
house
during
an
it
was
his
own
fault
the
dear
thing
he
had
a
craze
for
windows
this
house
has
more
glass
space
than
wall
i
think
and
pinehurst
in
his
spare
time
used
always
to
be
making
plans
for
squeezing
in
more
windows
our
room
is
like
a
conservatory
so
dretfully
embarrassing
so
i
always
take
my
knitting
across
the
road
to
the
crypt
of
sebastian
and
i
sure
you
wo
mind
coming
too
you
might
have
brought
a
box
of
spellicans
or
a
set
of
table
croquet
but
i
afraid
the
vicar
would
like
it
a
nice
man
but
dretfully
particular
we
must
wait
for
the
end
of
this
piece
the
first
violin
is
so
touchy
they
all
waited
patiently
while
the
piece
continued
it
was
a
plain
uneventful
piece
composed
by
a
higgins
relative
and
therefore
admired
in
the
household
a
thing
that
puzzles
me
said
the
witch
taking
advantage
of
an
emotional
pause
while
one
violin
was
wheezing
a
very
long
small
note
by
itself
is
why
only
ugly
songs
are
really
persistent
have
you
noticed
for
instance
that
a
peacock
or
a
cat
on
the
wall
or
a
baby
with
a
tin
trumpet
will
give
their
services
most
generously
for
hours
on
end
while
a
robin
on
a
snowy
tree
or
a
nightingale
or
a
fairy
she
was
interrupted
by
a
scuffling
sound
in
the
and
harold
the
broomstick
after
a
moment
rather
embarrassing
entanglement
with
a
butterfly
net
approached
panting
i
must
go
said
the
witch
i
bet
you
twopence
we
shall
have
some
fun
sarah
brown
i
come
back
and
fetch
you
when
it
all
over
lady
arabel
and
sarah
brown
crossed
the
road
to
the
church
richard
following
a
few
yards
behind
i
afraid
my
little
was
a
great
success
said
lady
arabel
confidentially
rrchud
and
angela
did
get
that
good
talk
on
occult
subjects
as
meta
ford
said
they
would
of
course
rrchud
as
you
noticed
was
dretfully
restless
and
lighthearted
all
boys
are
like
that
for
the
first
few
hours
of
their
leave
he
is
naturally
of
a
quiet
disposition
though
you
would
think
it
from
there
was
a
distant
blot
of
gunfire
on
the
air
just
as
they
reached
the
door
of
the
crypt
the
very
stout
dog
of
the
vicar
are
not
all
reverend
dogs
fat
was
waiting
there
with
a
bored
look
the
vicar
allows
no
animals
inside
the
crypt
so
hard
on
canary
which
has
fits
i
was
here
once
when
the
vicar
youngest
son
brought
in
a
rabbit
under
his
coat
a
dretful
scene
my
dear
that
district
of
london
happened
to
be
rather
a
courageous
one
the
inhabitants
felt
that
if
the
war
had
to
be
brought
home
to
them
common
politeness
dictated
that
it
should
find
them
at
home
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
people
in
the
crypt
therefore
most
of
them
were
old
ladies
from
the
district
less
respectable
quarter
knitting
the
vicar
was
trying
to
press
comfort
upon
them
but
without
much
success
for
they
were
all
quite
content
discussing
the
deaths
in
their
families
the
noise
of
gunfire
was
coming
nearer
shaking
the
ground
like
the
uneven
tread
of
a
drunken
giant
sarah
brown
concentrated
on
an
evening
newspaper
busily
reading
again
and
again
one
of
those
columns
of
confidential
advertisement
which
everybody
reads
with
avidity
while
determining
the
more
never
to
buy
the
article
advertised
but
presently
the
fidgeting
hands
of
richard
caught
her
eye
and
she
looked
at
him
he
was
sitting
next
to
his
mother
on
a
stone
step
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
quieter
mood
and
attempted
no
manifestation
sarah
brown
thought
he
was
suppressing
excitement
however
and
indeed
he
presently
said
i
say
wo
it
be
fun
lying
about
all
this
to
posterity
and
americans
and
other
defenceless
innocents
opposite
to
them
on
two
campstools
sat
a
young
bridling
mother
of
fifty
with
her
old
hard
daughter
of
sixteen
or
so
hard
was
that
daughter
in
every
way
you
would
have
counted
her
age
in
winters
not
in
summers
so
obviously
untender
were
her
years
an
iron
plait
of
hair
lay
for
about
six
inches
down
her
spine
her
feet
and
ankles
made
the
campstool
on
which
she
sat
looking
pathetically
ethereal
of
such
stuff
as
this
is
the
backbone
of
england
made
which
is
perhaps
why
the
backbone
of
england
sometimes
seems
so
sadly
inflexible
there
was
a
screeching
noise
outside
followed
by
an
incredible
crash
it
seemed
to
cleave
a
bottomless
abyss
between
one
second
and
the
next
so
that
one
seemed
to
be
conscious
for
the
first
time
in
an
astonished
and
astonishing
world
lady
arabel
said
boys
will
be
boys
of
course
i
know
but
really
this
is
going
a
little
too
far
pinehurst
one
hobby
was
his
windows
the
campstooled
mother
gave
a
luxurious
little
shriek
as
soon
as
the
crash
was
safely
over
the
villains
she
said
kittenishly
aiming
at
places
of
worship
as
usual
i
am
absolutely
paralysed
with
terror
mary
darling
i
do
believe
you
turned
a
hair
pas
un
cheval
replied
her
firm
daughter
in
not
unnatural
error
one
could
easily
see
that
she
was
beloved
at
home
and
one
wondered
why
the
sound
of
the
guns
seemed
only
a
negative
form
of
sound
after
the
bomb
and
clearly
above
the
firing
could
be
heard
a
howl
the
dog
still
howling
ran
into
the
crypt
rupert
said
the
vicar
in
a
terrible
voice
interrupting
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
cheering
platitude
but
he
had
no
time
to
say
anything
more
for
behind
rupert
came
a
procession
of
perhaps
a
dozen
people
all
dressed
in
sheets
everybody
saw
at
one
pitiful
glance
that
these
were
unfortunate
householders
so
suddenly
roused
from
oblivion
as
to
forget
all
their
ordinary
suburban
dignity
probably
barely
escaping
from
ruined
homes
with
their
lives
and
a
sheet
each
there
was
a
very
old
man
a
spinster
and
then
an
enormous
group
of
children
of
ages
varying
from
two
months
to
twenty
years
followed
by
their
parents
teachers
or
guardians
a
nearer
gun
began
to
fire
and
one
of
the
old
ladies
on
the
other
side
of
the
crypt
suddenly
threw
down
her
knitting
and
began
confessing
her
sins
ow
i
shall
go
to
she
shouted
dramatically
i
bin
sich
a
wicked
ol
woman
i
nearly
done
in
me
first
ol
man
by
biffin
the
chopper
at
nob
and
lawd
the
lies
i
bin
an
tol
me
second
only
yesterday
this
is
indeed
a
solemn
moment
said
the
sheeted
spinster
sitting
down
beside
lady
arabel
i
hope
i
am
meeting
it
in
a
proper
spirit
but
of
course
one
is
still
only
human
and
naturally
nervous
i
have
learned
my
statement
by
heart
what
statement
asked
lady
arabel
who
was
rather
deeply
engrossed
in
turning
the
heel
of
the
sock
she
was
knitting
the
statement
i
shall
make
when
the
sheep
are
divided
from
the
goats
oh
come
come
said
kind
lady
arabel
things
are
not
so
bad
as
that
surely
you
must
not
be
so
dretfully
pessimistic
you
mistake
me
said
the
sheeted
lady
bridling
there
is
i
am
confident
no
cause
whatever
for
pessimism
on
my
part
i
have
no
misgivings
as
to
the
verdict
but
not
being
used
to
courts
of
law
i
thought
it
best
to
learn
my
statement
as
i
say
by
heart
the
old
knitter
had
been
rather
annoyed
to
find
her
confession
interrupted
a
wicked
ol
woman
i
may
be
she
said
with
more
dignity
but
i
never
regret
givin
that
bloody
speshul
a
bit
o
me
mind
this
mornin
when
turned
saucy
to
the
sugar
queue
i
ses
to
we
all
have
our
faults
lady
arabel
neighbour
broke
in
but
i
think
at
this
solemn
moment
i
may
feel
thankful
that
hastiness
of
recrimination
was
never
one
of
mine
all
my
life
i
have
made
it
an
unalterable
rule
never
to
make
a
statement
without
first
asking
myself
is
it
is
it
is
it
you
may
well
say
so
replied
lady
arabel
pleasantly
i
only
wish
the
younger
generation
would
follow
your
example
nowadays
it
is
much
more
likely
to
be
is
it
true
no
is
it
just
no
is
it
kind
no
is
it
yes
and
out
it
comes
be
that
as
it
may
said
the
ladylike
creature
one
could
see
she
was
a
real
lady
even
through
the
sheet
obviously
she
read
the
daily
be
that
as
it
may
perhaps
you
can
help
me
in
one
little
matter
which
is
intriguing
me
slightly
even
at
this
solemn
moment
do
you
suppose
the
sheep
will
be
allowed
to
hear
the
trial
of
the
goats
or
will
the
court
be
cleared
i
must
say
i
should
be
so
interested
to
hear
the
defence
of
the
late
churchwarden
who
eloped
with
ah
please
please
said
lady
arabel
do
talk
in
that
dretful
way
do
let
your
mind
dwell
on
the
worst
i
assure
you
that
you
will
be
all
right
of
course
i
shall
be
all
right
as
you
put
it
said
the
elderly
lady
coldly
drawing
herself
up
everybody
can
be
my
witness
that
i
have
kept
my
candle
burning
in
my
small
corner
good
gracious
shrieked
the
kittenish
mother
a
candle
burning
and
probably
unshaded
do
you
know
that
those
fiends
in
the
sky
are
always
on
the
watch
for
the
slightest
illumination
fiends
in
the
sky
exclaimed
the
sheeted
lady
do
you
mean
to
say
they
are
abroad
even
at
this
solemn
moment
oh
do
talk
such
rot
implored
the
hard
flapper
who
the
dickens
do
you
suppose
was
responsible
for
that
crash
responsible
for
the
crash
said
the
other
whose
tones
were
becoming
more
and
more
alive
with
exclamation
marks
is
then
the
solemn
work
of
summoning
us
entrusted
to
the
minions
of
the
evil
one
a
series
of
crashes
interrupted
her
the
work
of
the
adjacent
gun
the
earth
shook
and
each
report
was
followed
by
the
curious
ethereal
wail
of
shells
on
their
way
what
again
exclaimed
lady
arabel
sheeted
neighbour
i
should
have
thought
one
would
have
been
ample
but
still
one
can
not
be
too
careful
and
some
people
are
heavy
sleepers
i
heard
the
first
myself
without
any
possibility
of
mistake
and
rose
at
once
though
the
slab
lay
heavy
on
my
chest
most
unwise
said
lady
arabel
to
touch
that
sort
of
thing
late
at
night
i
always
have
a
little
benger
myself
sarah
brown
happened
to
look
at
richard
his
eyes
were
shut
but
he
was
smiling
very
broadly
with
tight
lips
and
his
face
was
turned
towards
the
ceiling
his
fingers
were
very
tense
and
busy
on
his
lap
as
though
he
were
still
fidgeting
with
magic
but
her
study
of
him
was
interrupted
by
the
loud
denouncing
voice
of
the
very
venerable
man
who
had
led
the
procession
of
a
dog
in
this
hallowed
place
he
said
pointing
at
the
deeply
disconcerted
rupert
who
was
weaving
himself
nervously
in
and
out
of
his
master
legs
never
in
all
the
forty
years
of
my
ministration
here
have
i
allowed
such
an
outrage
gently
gently
my
dear
sir
protested
the
vicar
a
little
roused
i
am
the
minister
of
this
church
and
the
dog
is
mine
i
was
indeed
about
to
turn
it
out
when
you
entered
after
which
i
lost
sight
of
it
for
a
moment
rupert
go
home
rupert
howled
again
and
lay
down
as
if
about
to
faint
forty
years
have
i
been
vicar
of
this
parish
said
the
veteran
and
never
what
interrupted
the
vicar
forty
years
vicar
of
this
parish
then
you
must
be
canon
how
very
extraordinary
i
always
understood
that
he
passed
away
quite
ten
years
ago
he
approached
the
old
man
and
strove
to
him
the
sheet
at
first
foiled
him
in
this
intention
but
he
presently
contented
himself
with
seizing
a
little
corner
of
it
by
which
he
led
his
aged
brother
vicar
into
a
corner
there
they
could
be
heard
for
some
time
misunderstanding
each
other
in
low
earnest
tones
ow
what
a
wicked
ol
woman
i
bin
an
bin
suddenly
burst
forth
again
the
repentant
knitter
i
bin

stole

of
the

where
i
does
a
bit

sarah
brown
was
becoming
sleepy
a
blankness
was
invading
her
mind
and
the
talk
in
the
crypt
seemed
to
lose
its
meaning
and
to
consist
chiefly
of
s
she
pondered
idly
on
the
family
of
children
with
their
elders
all
of
whom
were
now
studying
each
other
with
a
certain
look
of
disillusionment
it
was
a
group
whose
relationships
were
difficult
to
make
out
the
ages
of
many
of
the
children
being
unnaturally
approximate
there
seemed
to
be
at
least
seven
children
under
three
years
old
and
yet
they
all
bore
a
strong
and
regrettable
family
likeness
several
of
the
babies
would
hardly
have
been
given
credit
for
having
reached
walking
age
yet
none
had
been
carried
in
the
woman
who
seemed
to
imagine
herself
the
mother
of
this
rabble
was
distributing
what
looked
like
hurried
final
words
of
advice
the
father
with
a
pensive
eye
was
obviously
trying
to
remember
their
names
and
at
intervals
whispering
to
a
man
apparently
twenty
years
his
senior
whom
he
addressed
as
sonny
it
was
all
very
confusing
a
long
dim
stretch
of
time
seemed
to
have
passed
when
suddenly
the
note
of
a
bugle
sprang
out
across
space
somehow
the
air
at
once
felt
cooler
and
more
wholesome
the
sound
of
the
had
something
akin
to
the
sight
of
the
sun
after
a
thunderstorm
lighting
up
a
crouching
whipped
world
the
trump
at
last
said
lady
arabel
garrulous
neighbour
rising
with
alacrity
and
twitching
her
sheet
into
more
becoming
folds
i
was
just
wondering
but
at
that
moment
the
two
vicars
approached
and
the
elder
one
including
both
the
spinster
and
the
mysterious
family
in
one
glance
spoke
in
a
clerical
yet
embarrassed
voice
dear
friends
a
slight
but
inconvenient
mistake
has
occurred
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
submit
blindly
to
my
guidance
in
a
matter
strangely
difficult
to
explain
even
as
i
myself
in
much
confusion
bow
to
the
advice
of
my
reverend
friend
here
it
would
be
out
of
place
the
spinster
interrupted
and
by
the
way
she
did
it
one
saw
that
she
was
chapel
excuse
me
canon
she
said
acidly
but
is
not
all
discussion
out
of
place
at
this
solemn
moment
believe
me
madam
replied
the
aged
you
overrate
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
i
must
earnestly
ask
you
all
to
return
with
me
to
the
places
whence
labouring
under
an
extraordinary
error
we
came
i
see
that
parachute
trusts
me
and
is
prepared
to
lead
her
little
flock
to
rest
again
you
madam
where
parachute
leads
far
be
it
from
me
to
seem
behindhand
said
the
other
much
ruffled
as
she
gathered
her
sheet
about
her
by
the
way
she
said
it
one
saw
that
she
and
parachute
did
not
call
she
bowed
to
lady
arabel
and
became
satirical
even
arch
good
afternoon
er
i
am
assured
that
the
moment
is
not
solemn
and
therefore
solemn
it
shall
not
be
to
turn
to
lighter
subjects
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
and
your
delightful
son
and
daughter
again
at
no
distant
date
the
moment
then
being
genuinely
solemn
i
fear
i
have
no
visiting
card
on
me
but
er
perhaps
my
slab
just
outside
very
superior
granite
would
do
as
a
substitute
the
pale
party
filed
out
of
the
crypt
and
disappeared
the
remaining
vicar
smote
his
brow
and
addressed
the
now
calm
rupert
in
a
low
voice
but
with
such
unaccountable
warmth
that
that
harassed
animal
disappeared
precipitately
in
the
direction
of
his
home
lady
arabel
sarah
brown
and
richard
crossed
the
churchyard
together
oh
my
dears
look
said
lady
arabel
how
too
too
dretful
that
bomb
fell
quite
close
to
us
do
look
how
it
has
disturbed
the
graves
chapter
vi
an
air
raid
seen
from
above
the
moonlight
lay
like
cream
upon
the
pavement
when
the
witch
and
harold
her
broomstick
left
the
higgins
doorstep
london
was
a
still
switzerland
in
silver
and
unblotted
by
people
there
was
a
hint
of
pale
green
about
the
moonlight
and
the
lamps
with
their
dim
light
downcast
were
like
daffodils
in
faery
fields
the
witch
mounted
harold
who
was
every
inch
a
thoroughbred
and
very
highly
strung
trembled
beneath
her
but
not
with
fear
they
reached
piccadilly
circus
with
supernatural
speed
and
flashed
across
it
the
sound
of
people
singing
desultorily
while
taking
shelter
in
the
tube
floated
up
to
them
here
the
witch
said
yoop
to
harold
and
he
reared
and
shot
upwards
narrowly
missing
the
statue
of
one
in
a
attitude
which
marks
the
middle
of
the
circus
as
soon
as
the
witch
had
the
noise
of
expectant
london
she
heard
quite
distinctly
the
approach
of
london
guests
they
came
with
a
chorus
of
many
notes
all
deep
and
dangerous
there
were
a
few
clouds
wandering
about
among
the
stars
and
to
one
of
these
the
witch
and
her
faithful
harold
repaired
a
cloud
gives
quite
reasonable
support
to
magic
people
and
most
witches
and
wizards
have
discovered
the
delight
of
paddling
about
those
quicksilver
continents
they
wander
along
shining
and
changing
valleys
under
a
most
ardent
sky
they
climb
the
purple
thunderclouds
or
launch
the
first
snowflake
of
a
blizzard
they
spring
from
pink
to
pink
of
clouds
each
no
bigger
than
a
baby
hand
across
great
sunsets
often
when
in
london
i
am
battling
with
a
barrage
of
rain
or
falling
over
unseen
strangers
into
gutters
during
fogs
i
think
happily
of
the
sunlit
roof
of
cloud
above
my
head
and
of
the
witches
and
wizards
lying
on
their
backs
with
their
coats
off
among
in
a
glory
of
perfect
summer
and
sun
the
witch
with
one
soothing
hand
on
the
bristling
mane
of
her
harold
lay
on
her
front
on
the
cloud
she
had
chosen
and
looked
down
through
a
little
hole
in
it
it
was
practically
the
only
cloud
present
that
would
have
afforded
reasonable
cover
the
others
were
mere
wisps
of
floating
in
the
moonlight
there
was
a
greater
chorus
of
aeroplanes
below
her
now
the
whole
sky
was
ringing
with
it
the
witch
could
hear
a
deep
machine
a
baritone
a
quavering
tenor
and
thin
and
sharp
as
a
pin
a
little
treble
sound
that
made
harold
rear
and
struggle
to
be
free
another
witch
said
the
witch
i
was
wondering
why
the
huns
got
their
magic
organised
by
now
she
mounted
her
harold
and
slipped
off
the
cloud
the
guns
were
shouting
now
and
the
shells
wailed
and
burst
not
so
very
far
below
them
but
harold
trembled
no
longer
more
quickly
than
a
falling
star
he
swooped
and
in
a
second
the
alien
witch
was
in
sight
an
unwieldy
figure
whose
broomstick
sounded
rather
probably
owing
to
the
flight
and
to
the
fourteen
stone
of
teutonic
magic
on
its
back
there
was
a
apparatus
attached
to
the
collar
of
the
german
broomstick
obviously
designed
to
squirt
unpleasant
enchantments
downward
this
contrivance
was
apparently
giving
some
trouble
for
the
german
was
so
busy
attending
to
it
that
at
first
she
did
not
see
or
hear
the
approach
of
harold
and
his
rider
she
was
aroused
to
her
danger
by
a
heavy
chunk
of
magic
which
struck
and
nearly
unseated
her
in
a
second
however
she
was
ready
with
a
parrying
enchantment
and
the
fight
began
the
two
broomsticks
reared
and
circled
round
each
other
and
over
and
under
each
other
from
their
magic
of
the
most
explosive
kind
crackled
and
incantations
of
such
potency
were
exchanged
that
i
am
told
the
tiles
and
of
the
streets
below
suffered
a
good
deal
round
and
round
and
over
and
under
whirled
the
broomsticks
till
the
very
spaces
went
mad
and
london
seemed
to
rush
down
nightmare
slopes
into
a
stormy
sky
while
its
lights
swung
from
pole
to
pole
and
were
entangled
with
the
stars
both
broomsticks
were
by
now
so
uproariously
excited
that
neither
witch
was
able
to
aim
her
magic
missiles
very
carefully
and
indeed
it
was
not
long
before
harold
passed
entirely
beyond
control
after
bucking
violently
once
or
twice
he
gave
a
wild
high
cry
that
was
like
the
wind
howling
through
the
fierce
forest
past
of
his
race
and
fell
upon
the
other
broomstick
fixing
his
bristles
into
its
throat
the
shock
of
the
collision
was
too
much
for
both
witches
our
witch
if
i
may
call
her
so
was
shot
over
harold
head
and
landed
on
the
ample
breast
of
her
adversary
who
in
consequence
lost
her
balance
they
fell
together
into
space
oh
lost
lost
cried
our
witch
and
thoughts
rushed
through
her
mind
of
green
safe
places
and
old
safe
years
and
the
little
hut
in
a
pale
bluebell
wood
where
she
was
born
she
had
time
to
remember
the
blue
ground
dimpled
and
starred
with
sunlight
and
the
way
the
bees
pulled
over
the
bluebells
and
swung
on
them
to
the
tune
of
cuckoos
in
a
may
mist
she
had
time
to
think
of
the
green
globe
ghosts
of
the
bluebells
that
haunted
the
wood
after
the
spring
was
dead
bluebells
and
being
young
were
in
all
her
thoughts
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
noticed
how
slowly
she
and
her
enemy
were
falling
for
they
were
locked
together
and
the
enemy
witch
cloak
an
orthodox
witch
cloak
except
for
its
colour
which
was
german
instead
of
red
was
spread
out
like
a
parachute
and
was
supporting
them
upon
their
peaceful
and
almost
affectionate
descent
for
all
i
know
they
might
have
alighted
gently
in
the
strand
and
the
authorities
might
by
now
be
regretting
the
capture
of
a
most
embarrassing
and
unaccountable
prisoner
but
something
intervened
the
cloud
like
a
sheep
suffering
from
the
lack
of
other
sheep
to
follow
had
not
yet
quitted
the
scene
the
witches
battle
had
tended
upward
and
it
had
ended
several
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
cloud
which
was
apparently
sinking
the
downward
course
of
the
fall
was
therefore
arrested
and
they
found
themselves
still
interlocked
prostrate
and
embedded
with
their
eyes
and
mouths
full
of
woolly
wisps
of
cloud
our
witch
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
she
stood
up
and
brushed
herself
remarking
by
jove
that
parachute
cloak
of
yours
is
a
great
dodge
i
wish
i
thought
of
it
i
always
keep
my
togs
put
away
like
the
ass
that
i
am
a
stitch
or
two
and
a
few
lengths
of
whalebone
would
have
done
the
trick
the
german
was
an
older
woman
and
less
adaptable
to
the
strange
chances
of
war
she
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
seated
in
the
small
crater
made
in
the
cloud
by
her
fall
she
was
not
exactly
ugly
she
had
the
sort
of
face
about
which
one
could
not
help
feeling
that
one
could
have
done
it
better
oneself
or
at
least
that
one
could
have
taken
more
trouble
it
seemed
moulded
even
kneaded
carelessly
in
very
soft
material
beneath
her
open
cloak
her
dress
was
of
the
ordinary
german
type
and
her
figure
had
the
rather
jelloid
appearance
of
those
who
affect
this
style
her
regulation
witch
hat
was
by
now
probably
in
the
serpentine
and
her
round
head
was
therefore
disclosed
with
two
stout
plaits
pursuing
each
other
round
it
the
witches
faced
each
other
for
some
seconds
a
long
way
away
they
could
hear
the
spitting
and
crackling
sound
of
the
two
broomsticks
fighting
looking
up
they
could
see
the
combatants
like
black
comets
in
collision
our
witch
who
had
good
sight
saw
that
the
enemy
broomstick
was
and
that
the
writhing
harold
was
being
shaken
like
a
mouse
their
bristles
were
interlocked
one
twig
floated
down
between
the
witches
and
our
witch
recognised
it
as
coming
from
her
poor
harold
mane
as
for
this
purpose
she
brought
her
eyes
to
her
immediate
surroundings
it
seemed
to
her
suddenly
that
the
sky
was
growing
larger
and
then
she
realised
that
this
was
because
their
refuge
was
growing
smaller
the
edges
of
the
cloud
were
dissolving
she
saw
at
last
her
peril
and
her
disadvantage
if
harold
should
be
killed
or
disabled
she
could
never
reach
the
earth
again
except
by
means
of
a
fatal
fall
of
several
thousand
feet
the
enemy
witch
with
her
ingenious
cloak
contrivance
strapped
securely
about
her
stood
a
reasonable
chance
of
escape
but
our
witch
was
an
amateur
in
war
she
was
without
support
forlornly
dressed
in
her
faithful
blue
serge
and
her
little
squirrel
tippet
magic
as
you
know
has
limitations
fire
is
of
course
a
plaything
in
magic
hands
water
has
its
docile
moments
the
earth
herself
may
be
tampered
with
and
an
incantation
may
call
man
or
any
of
his
possessions
to
attention
but
space
is
too
great
a
thing
space
is
the
inconceivable
hand
holding
aloft
this
fragile
delusion
that
is
our
world
there
is
no
power
that
can
mock
at
space
there
is
no
enchantment
that
is
not
lost
between
us
and
the
moon
and
all
magic
people
know
and
tremble
to
know
that
in
a
breath
between
one
second
and
another
that
hand
may
close
and
the
shell
of
time
first
crack
and
then
be
crushed
and
magic
be
one
with
nothingness
and
death
and
all
other
delusions
this
is
why
magic
which
treats
the
other
elements
as
its
servants
bows
before
space
and
has
to
call
such
a
purely
independent
contrivance
as
a
broomstick
to
its
help
in
the
matter
of
the
witches
faced
each
other
on
their
little
unstable
sanctuary
in
the
kingdom
of
space
our
witch
felt
secretly
sick
and
at
the
same
time
she
tore
fear
from
her
mind
and
knew
that
death
was
but
an
imperfectly
kept
secret
and
that
not
an
evil
one
after
all
we
have
condemned
it
unheard
both
witches
could
talk
a
magic
tongue
and
make
themselves
mutually
understood
neither
knew
the
other
natural
tongue
but
when
our
witch
noticed
several
large
ferocious
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
she
was
able
by
means
of
magic
to
say
great
scott
my
good
person
what
are
you
crying
for
i
am
not
crying
replied
the
german
witch
i
would
not
allow
one
tear
of
mine
to
fall
upon
and
water
one
possible
grain
of
wheat
in
this
accursed
country
of
yours
certainly
i
am
not
crying
accursed
country
echoed
the
astounded
english
witch
how
mean
accursed
this
is
england
you
know
england
has
done
anything
accursed
are
you
muddling
it
up
with
germany
england
is
the
world
enemy
said
the
german
evidently
pleased
to
meet
someone
to
whom
this
information
was
fresh
throughout
the
ages
she
has
been
the
robber
state
crushing
the
weaker
nations
adding
to
her
own
wealth
by
treachery
and
now
forcing
this
war
of
aggression
upon
her
neighbours
our
witch
laughed
she
was
forgetting
her
danger
this
is
really
rather
funny
she
said
do
you
know
what
happened
you
been
reading
the
and
misunderstanding
it
the
whole
of
that
quotation
applied
to
germany
not
england
it
germany
that
being
naughty
you
made
a
mistake
but
never
mind
i
wo
repeat
it
the
german
took
no
notice
of
this
the
past
three
years
had
made
her
an
adept
in
taking
no
notice
and
now
she
added
after
all
these
weary
months
of
hoping
and
broomstick
practice
and
of
parachute
practice
and
of
conflict
with
narrow
officialdom
i
have
come
and
this
is
the
result
i
am
separated
from
my
broomstick
which
has
all
the
hanging
from
its
collar
the
germs
are
those
of
dissension
and
riot
i
am
marooned
upon
an
english
cloud
with
no
enemy
at
my
mercy
but
a
paltry
and
treacherous
at
your
mercy
breathed
our
witch
remembering
she
looked
up
the
broomsticks
were
closer
now
and
through
the
breathless
air
amidst
the
firing
of
the
guns
below
she
could
hear
the
difficult
gasping
of
the
harold
still
fighting
bravely
but
with
hardly
a
twig
on
his
head
the
tide
of
space
was
coming
in
the
edge
of
the
cloud
was
barely
six
inches
from
her
hand
our
witch
mind
overflowed
with
the
thought
of
invasions
and
the
coming
in
of
tides
it
seemed
that
all
her
life
she
had
been
living
on
a
narrowing
shore
she
remembered
all
her
dawns
as
precarious
footholds
of
peace
on
a
threatened
rock
and
all
her
evenings
as
golden
sands
sloping
down
into
encroaching
sleep
she
realised
everything
as
a
little
hopeless
garrison
against
the
army
of
nothing
she
clutched
a
pinch
of
cloud
nervously
and
it
broke
off
in
her
hand
she
recalled
her
senses
with
a
devastating
effort
do
you
mean
to
say
she
said
after
a
moment
that
poor
dear
germany
really
believes
that
she
is
right
and
we
are
wrong
i
suppose
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
a
tiger
feels
the
same
way
it
fights
with
a
high
heart
and
a
hot
reproach
just
as
we
do
we
are
crusaders
said
the
german
crusaders
at
war
with
evil
why
how
funny
so
are
we
said
our
witch
but
then
how
very
peculiar
that
two
crusaders
should
apparently
be
fighting
each
other
where
then
is
the
evil
in
no
man
land
we
are
fighting
recited
the
german
glibly
because
england
is
the
world
enemy
throughout
the
ages
she
has
been
the
rob
there
was
a
violent
explosion
quite
close
to
them
and
the
cloud
reeled
and
shook
about
a
foot
of
the
german
end
of
it
broke
off
and
was
dissolved
we
within
range
of
our
guns
said
our
witch
looking
down
this
cloud
must
be
sinking
it
will
never
sink
enough
to
save
you
said
the
german
trying
to
conceal
the
nervousness
with
which
she
rearranged
her
cloak
round
her
she
seemed
to
be
sinking
herself
to
a
certain
extent
perhaps
the
warmth
of
her
emotions
was
melting
the
cloud
beneath
her
certainly
she
now
sat
apparently
squat
as
an
idol
her
figure
submerged
in
cloud
to
the
waist
the
english
witch
looked
down
singing
a
little
to
keep
up
her
london
looked
exactly
like
the
maps
you
buy
for
sixpence
from
gentlemen
in
the
strand
only
it
was
sown
with
a
thin
crop
of
lights
and
was
chiefly
designed
in
grey
and
darker
grey
and
the
tubes
did
not
show
so
indecently
with
surprising
clearness
the
rhythmic
whispering
of
the
trains
and
the
scanty
traffic
could
be
heard
and
once
even
the
shrill
characteristic
voice
of
an
ambulance
somehow
space
did
not
seem
disturbed
by
these
sounds
its
quietness
pressed
upon
the
listeners
minds
like
a
heavy
dream
and
there
was
no
real
believing
in
anything
but
space
our
witch
felt
she
could
have
smudged
london
off
the
face
of
space
with
her
finger
and
the
thought
of
seven
million
lives
involved
in
the
fate
of
that
sliding
chart
carried
no
conviction
to
her
she
forced
into
her
mind
the
realisation
of
humanity
and
of
little
lives
lived
in
little
rooms
as
one
crusader
to
another
she
said
do
you
find
it
does
much
good
in
the
war
against
evil
to
drop
bombs
on
people
in
their
homes
after
all
every
baby
is
good
in
bed
and
even
soldiers
when
on
leave
are
it
always
does
good
to
exterminate
vermin
in
their
lair
said
the
german
trying
restlessly
to
raise
herself
more
to
the
level
of
her
lighter
companion
who
was
still
perched
on
the
surface
of
the
cloud
it
is
at
home
that
evil
is
originated
it
is
at
home
that
english
women
conceive
and
bear
a
new
generation
of
enemies
of
the
right
it
is
at
home
that
english
children
are
bred
up
in
their
marauding
ways
it
is
on
the
home
the
vital
place
of
evil
that
the
scourge
should
fall
oh
but
surely
not
said
our
witch
eagerly
it
is
at
home
that
people
are
kindly
and
think
what
they
will
have
for
supper
and
bathe
their
babies
men
come
home
when
they
are
hurt
or
hungry
and
women
when
they
are
lonely
or
tired
nobody
is
taught
anything
stupid
or
international
at
home
you
can
bring
death
to
a
home
but
never
a
righteous
scourge
nobody
feels
scourged
or
instructed
by
a
bomb
in
their
parlour
they
just
feel
dead
and
dead
without
a
reason
the
cloud
was
very
small
now
the
filmy
edges
of
it
were
faintly
rising
and
falling
like
the
seaweed
frill
of
a
rock
in
the
sea
the
witch
kept
her
eyes
on
her
opponent
face
because
to
look
anywhere
else
gave
her
a
white
feeling
in
her
head
crusades
of
the
high
explosive
kind
she
said
can
work
only
on
indeed
even
on
ah
what
are
we
about
what
are
we
about
we
are
neither
of
us
killing
evil
we
are
killing
youth
i
know
i
know
wept
the
german
witch
my
wizard
fell
at
vimy
ridge
you
are
talking
magic
at
last
said
our
witch
dear
witch
why
you
go
home
and
ask
how
it
can
be
a
good
plan
for
one
crusader
against
evil
to
blow
up
another
how
can
two
people
be
righteously
scourging
each
other
at
the
same
time
it
is
like
the
old
problem
of
two
serpents
eating
each
other
starting
at
the
tail
there
must
be
some
misunderstanding
somewhere
or
else
some
real
evil
somewhere
there
is
said
the
german
recovering
herself
england
is
evil
england
is
the
world
enemy
throughout
the
ages
she
has
been
the
robber
state
crushing
but
she
had
little
luck
once
more
she
was
interrupted
by
an
explosion
a
much
louder
one
directly
above
them
our
witch
hardly
heard
the
noise
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
found
the
climax
of
her
life
and
the
climax
was
pain
there
was
pain
and
a
feeling
of
terrible
change
all
over
her
smothering
her
and
a
in
her
shoulder
after
a
second
or
two
as
long
as
death
she
realised
dimly
that
she
was
all
tensely
strung
to
an
attitude
like
a
marionette
her
hands
were
up
trying
to
shield
her
head
her
chin
was
pressed
down
to
her
knees
her
blue
serge
shoulder
was
extraordinarily
wet
and
immovable
she
looked
along
the
cloud
her
enemy
was
not
there
there
was
a
round
hole
in
the
cloud
and
as
she
leaned
painfully
towards
it
she
could
see
a
few
of
the
lights
of
london
and
something
falling
spasmodically
towards
them
the
cloud
had
been
shaken
to
its
foundations
by
the
two
explosions
and
the
german
witch
who
had
been
seated
perhaps
on
a
seam
in
the
material
or
at
any
rate
on
one
of
the
less
stable
parts
of
the
fabric
had
fallen
through
her
parachute
cloak
in
passing
through
the
hole
in
the
cloud
had
been
turned
inside
out
above
her
head
and
rendered
useless
over
and
about
her
falling
figure
her
broomstick
darted
helplessly
uttering
curious
sad
cries
like
a
seagull
even
as
the
english
witch
watched
her
enemy
disaster
the
larger
part
of
the
cloud
weakened
by
all
the
shock
and
movement
broke
away
with
a
hissing
sound
the
witch
feet
hung
now
over
space
she
dared
not
move
she
had
difficulty
in
steadying
herself
with
her
unwounded
arm
for
her
hand
could
find
only
a
quicksand
of
dissolving
cloud
to
lean
on
she
had
no
thoughts
left
but
thoughts
of
danger
and
of
pain
but
harold
the
broomstick
came
back
the
witch
heard
a
rustling
sound
close
to
her
and
it
startled
her
more
than
all
the
noise
of
the
guns
which
had
come
as
it
seemed
from
the
forgotten
other
side
of
eternity
the
rough
head
of
harold
appeared
over
the
cloud
edge
and
insinuated
itself
pathetically
under
her
arm
very
carefully
and
very
painfully
the
witch
reached
a
kneeling
position
damaging
her
refuge
with
every
movement
in
spite
of
her
care
she
gasped
with
pain
and
harold
tried
to
look
very
strong
and
hopeful
to
comfort
her
he
straightened
his
back
and
she
crawled
into
the
saddle
the
tremor
of
their
launching
split
the
cloud
into
several
parts
which
disintegrated
there
was
no
more
on
it
the
tide
had
come
up
and
submerged
it
harold
the
broomstick
was
crippled
he
stumbled
as
he
flew
sometimes
he
dropped
a
score
of
feet
and
span
he
did
stunts
by
mistake
they
had
not
strength
enough
between
them
to
get
home
they
made
a
forced
landing
in
the
silver
loneliness
of
kensington
gardens
it
was
a
fortunate
place
for
there
is
much
magic
there
wherever
there
are
children
who
pretend
there
grows
a
little
magic
in
the
air
and
therefore
the
wind
of
kensington
gardens
thrills
with
enchantment
and
the
round
pond
full
of
much
pretence
of
great
armadas
crossed
and
with
the
abiding
wakes
of
ships
full
of
treasure
and
romance
is
a
blessed
lake
to
magic
people
the
witch
bathed
harold
her
broomstick
in
the
round
pond
he
evidently
felt
its
healing
quality
at
once
for
after
the
first
minute
of
immersion
he
swam
about
exultantly
and
shook
drops
full
of
moonlight
out
of
his
mane
the
bugles
sounded
in
many
keys
all
round
the
ear
horizon
their
sound
matched
the
waning
moonlight
the
witch
bathed
her
shoulder
and
then
she
found
her
way
to
a
little
quiet
place
she
knew
of
where
no
ever
looks
a
place
where
secret
and
ungardened
daffodils
grow
in
springtime
a
place
where
all
the
mice
and
birds
play
unafraid
because
no
cat
can
find
the
way
thither
you
can
see
the
serpentine
from
that
place
and
the
bronze
shadows
under
its
bridge
but
no
houses
and
no
railways
and
no
signs
of
london
here
the
witch
made
a
little
fire
and
leaned
three
sticks
together
over
it
she
lighted
the
fire
with
her
and
hung
over
it
the
little
patent
folding
cauldron
which
she
always
carried
on
a
chatelaine
swinging
from
her
belt
and
she
made
a
charm
of
and
grasses
and
the
roots
of
unappreciated
weeds
and
the
mosses
that
cover
the
tiny
faery
cliffs
of
the
serpentine
over
the
mixture
she
shook
out
the
contents
of
one
of
her
little
paper
packets
of
magic
all
this
she
boiled
over
her
fire
for
many
hours
sitting
beside
it
in
the
silver
darkness
with
her
knees
drawn
up
and
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
them
the
trees
sprang
up
into
the
moonlight
like
dark
fountains
from
the
pools
of
their
own
shadows
little
shreds
of
cloud
flowed
wonderfully
across
the
sky
there
was
no
sound
except
the
sound
of
the
water
like
an
uncertain
player
upon
a
little
instrument
the
charm
was
still
unfinished
when
the
dawn
passed
over
london
and
the
sun
came
up
the
seed
of
another
day
sown
in
a
rich
red
soil
the
trees
of
the
gardens
remembered
their
daylight
shadows
again
and
forgot
their
mystery
the
after
examining
their
with
minute
care
for
some
moments
launched
themselves
upon
a
lake
of
diamonds
there
seemed
a
veil
of
mist
and
over
the
world
the
sudden
song
of
the
birds
was
like
finding
the
hearing
of
one
heart
restored
after
long
deafness
the
witch
anointed
her
shoulder
with
the
charm
after
having
first
made
a
drop
of
potion
out
of
the
bubbles
in
it
this
potion
she
drank
and
was
healed
of
her
wound
and
her
weariness
and
of
all
desires
except
a
desire
to
sleep
with
her
face
among
the
daffodils
she
was
the
most
beautifully
alone
person
in
the
world
that
morning
nobody
could
have
found
her
a
thin
string
of
very
blue
smoke
went
up
from
her
faint
fire
and
was
tangled
among
the
boughs
of
a
flowering
tree
but
the
coarse
eye
of
a
could
never
have
seen
it
she
had
escaped
from
the
net
of
the
cruel
hours
for
her
the
stained
world
was
washed
clean
for
her
all
horror
held
its
breath
for
her
there
was
absolute
spring
and
an
innocent
sun
and
the
shadows
of
daffodils
upon
closed
eyes
chapter
vii
the
faery
farm
sarah
brown
finding
herself
unfetched
by
the
witch
went
home
alone
as
soon
as
the
began
putting
out
to
sea
after
the
storm
she
expected
to
find
the
witch
at
home
but
only
the
dog
david
and
peony
were
in
the
house
of
living
alone
david
lay
on
peony
bed
and
peony
under
it
sarah
brown
saw
them
as
she
passed
their
open
door
ow
marmaduke
said
peony
is
it
all
over
are
you
sure
them
is
so
bloody
deceitful
you
never
know
but
what
they
might
go
an
blow
a
bugle
or
two
to
mike
believe
they
done
an
then
drops
bombs
on
us
just
as
we
was
comin
out
from
under
our
beds
peony
with
a
touching
faith
in
the
combined
protective
powers
of
twelve
inches
of
mattress
and
nine
inches
of
dog
had
been
reading
a
little
paper
book
called
in
by
the
light
of
an
electric
torch
it
all
truly
over
said
sarah
brown
who
had
come
home
through
a
roar
of
rumour
they
say
we
brought
down
at
least
one
boche
in
fact
the
ferryman
says
his
aunt
telephoned
that
the
special
on
her
corner
says
a
female
boche
was
brought
down
but
that
hardly
sounds
likely
has
the
witch
come
home
yet
lawd
no
replied
peony
the
dear
ol
soup
never
comes
of
a
moonlight
night
it
my
belief
she
goes
to
among
the
jews
to
keep
out
of
the
wiy
and
to
blime
well
that
all
right
said
sarah
brown
for
now
i
shall
be
able
to
buy
without
pawning
anything
for
the
moment
a
little
land
outfit
from
stock
i
know
she
has
some
the
night
was
by
then
far
from
young
in
fact
it
was
well
into
its
second
childhood
but
sarah
brown
and
the
dog
david
sought
and
tried
on
land
outfits
for
several
hours
the
shop
was
divided
into
three
horizontal
departments
nearest
the
floor
were
the
foodstuffs
biscuit
tins
buttressed
the
counter
on
every
side
regiments
of
officered
by
an
occasional
quaker
oat
stood
in
review
order
all
round
the
lower
shelves
on
the
counter
little
castles
of
tinned
fruit
were
built
while
bins
beneath
it
held
the
varied
grain
cereal
and
magic
stock
about
on
a
level
with
one
head
the
hardware
department
began
lolled
with
tin
over
racks
divorced
from
their
brushes
were
platonically
attached
to
or
stephen
inks
were
allied
with
penny
mugs
or
tins
of
boot
polish
in
an
invasion
of
the
middle
shelves
and
a
wreath
of
sponges
crowned
the
champion
of
a
row
of
kettles
in
shining
armour
against
the
ceiling
the
drapery
section
was
found
overalls
breeches
babies
socks
and
pink
flannelette
mysteries
hung
doubled
up
as
if
in
pain
over
strings
nailed
to
the
rafters
from
this
department
sarah
brown
balanced
upon
three
large
biscuit
tins
placed
on
the
counter
chose
her
outfit
with
vanity
and
care
the
general
effect
was
not
good
but
she
did
not
know
this
for
she
studied
the
parts
separately
in
a
mirror
she
was
filled
with
a
simple
pleasure
for
she
was
always
absurdly
moved
by
little
excitements
and
by
any
prospect
of
a
changed
she
was
not
really
used
to
being
alive
at
all
and
that
is
what
made
her
take
to
magic
so
kindly
in
six
hours
she
said
i
shall
be
on
my
way
to
something
utterly
new
and
in
six
hours
she
was
on
her
way
whistling
across
the
parish
of
faery
the
dog
david
ran
in
front
of
her
among
the
daisies
the
rabbits
can
never
be
caught
in
this
land
of
happy
animals
but
they
give
good
sport
and
always
play
fair
david
blessing
brown
a
dog
of
independent
yet
loving
habit
had
spent
about
of
his
life
in
the
brown
family
he
was
three
years
old
and
though
ineligible
for
military
service
made
a
point
of
wearing
khaki
about
his
face
and
in
a
symmetrical
spot
near
his
tail
to
sarah
brown
he
was
the
question
and
the
answer
his
presence
was
a
constant
playtime
for
her
mind
so
well
was
he
loved
that
he
seemed
to
her
to
move
in
a
little
mist
and
clamour
of
love
with
every
one
else
she
held
but
lame
intercourse
but
her
dog
david
and
she
withheld
no
passing
thought
from
each
other
they
could
often
be
heard
by
unmattering
landladies
and
exchanging
views
in
the
strong
suffolk
accent
that
was
a
sort
of
standing
joke
between
them
i
believe
that
sarah
brown
had
loved
the
dog
david
so
much
that
she
had
given
him
a
soul
certainly
other
dogs
did
not
care
for
him
david
said
that
they
had
found
out
that
his
second
name
was
blessing
and
that
they
laughed
at
him
for
it
his
face
was
seamed
with
the
scars
of
their
laughing
but
i
know
that
the
enmity
had
a
more
fundamental
reason
than
that
i
know
that
when
men
speak
with
the
tongues
of
angels
they
are
shunned
and
hated
by
men
and
so
i
think
that
when
dogs
approach
humanity
too
nearly
they
are
banished
from
the
love
of
their
own
kind
sarah
brown
was
not
altogether
unfamiliar
with
the
parish
of
faery
but
she
never
failed
to
be
surprised
by
the
enchantment
of
the
enchanted
forest
the
green
ride
runs
straight
through
it
so
incredibly
straight
that
as
you
walk
along
it
the
end
of
it
is
at
the
end
of
your
sight
and
is
like
a
star
in
a
green
sky
there
is
a
dream
that
binds
your
mind
as
you
cross
the
forest
it
is
like
an
imitation
of
eternity
so
that
as
you
pass
into
the
forest
shade
time
passes
from
before
you
and
as
you
pass
out
of
it
you
seem
to
have
lived
a
thousand
quiet
and
utterly
forgotten
lives
clocks
and
calendars
have
no
meaning
in
the
forest
the
seasons
and
the
hours
haunt
it
at
their
will
and
abide
by
no
law
just
as
the
sun
upon
a
stormy
day
makes
golden
a
moving
and
elusive
acre
in
our
human
woods
so
the
night
in
the
enchanted
forest
comes
and
goes
like
a
ghost
upon
the
sight
of
lovers
of
the
night
for
there
you
may
step
unastonished
from
the
end
of
a
day
into
its
beginning
there
the
summer
and
the
winter
may
dodge
each
other
round
one
tree
there
you
may
see
at
one
glance
a
spring
hoar
frost
and
an
autumn
trembling
of
airs
a
wild
cherry
tree
blossoming
beside
a
tawny
maple
the
forest
is
so
deep
and
so
thick
that
it
provides
its
own
sky
and
can
enjoy
its
own
impulses
and
its
own
quiet
anarchy
there
you
forget
that
sky
of
ours
across
whose
face
some
tyrant
drives
our
few
docile
seasons
in
conventional
order
i
think
the
dog
david
in
his
own
way
shared
the
dream
that
leads
wayfarers
through
the
enchanted
forest
when
he
came
out
with
sarah
brown
under
the
tasselled
arch
of
travellers
joy
that
crosses
the
end
of
the
green
ride
he
was
all
shining
and
dewy
with
adventure
and
his
tail
was
upright
as
though
he
were
pretending
that
it
carried
a
flag
on
an
abrupt
hill
in
the
middle
of
an
enormous
green
meadow
a
castle
stood
just
as
richard
had
predicted
it
was
to
let
and
was
not
looking
its
best
some
man
of
enterprise
taking
advantage
of
its
forlorn
condition
had
glued
an
advertisement
upon
its
donjon
keep
you
could
almost
have
measured
that
advertisement
in
acres
it
recommended
a
face
cream
and
represented
a
lady
with
a
face
of
horrible
size
whose
naturally
immaculate
complexion
was
marred
by
the
rivets
and
loopholes
of
the
donjon
keep
itself
which
protruded
in
rather
a
distressing
way
oak
trees
stood
round
the
foot
of
that
pale
hill
and
the
general
effect
was
rather
that
of
parsley
round
a
ham
between
two
oaks
sarah
brown
following
directions
found
the
beginning
of
the
daisified
path
there
were
not
only
daisies
all
over
the
path
but
real
violets
on
either
side
of
it
the
daisies
looked
one
in
the
face
but
the
violets
did
not
because
they
had
morbidly
bad
manners
still
of
course
manners
are
very
small
change
and
count
for
very
little
the
violet
being
an
artist
is
entitled
to
any
manners
it
likes
while
the
daisy
has
no
temperament
whatever
and
no
excuse
for
eccentricity
grasshoppers
tatted
industriously
and
impartially
among
the
daisies
and
the
violets
here
outside
the
forest
there
was
weather
again
and
the
weather
was
more
promising
than
generous
it
continued
to
promise
all
day
without
exactly
explaining
what
its
promise
was
and
without
achieving
any
special
fulfilment
fine
silver
lines
of
sunlight
were
ruled
at
a
steep
angle
across
a
grey
slate
view
at
the
gate
of
higgins
farm
sarah
brown
was
a
little
disconcerted
to
find
a
small
dragon
it
was
coiled
round
a
tree
beside
the
clipped
box
archway
it
was
not
a
very
fine
specimen
being
of
a
colour
and
having
lost
the
tip
of
one
wing
its
spine
was
serrated
especially
deeply
between
its
shoulder
blades
where
it
could
raise
a
sort
of
crest
if
angered
or
excited
but
at
present
it
was
asleep
its
saturnine
and
rather
wistful
face
rested
upon
one
scaly
paw
sarah
brown
was
uncertain
what
to
do
but
the
dog
david
took
the
matter
into
his
own
paws
by
mistake
he
had
just
met
one
of
the
castle
dogs
one
of
those
creatures
who
spend
themselves
in
a
rather
pathetic
effort
to
sustain
an
imaginary
reputation
for
humour
david
retorted
to
this
dog
first
facetious
onslaught
with
a
kindly
quip
they
trod
on
each
other
once
or
twice
with
extravagant
gestures
and
then
parted
hysterically
each
supposing
himself
to
be
pursued
by
the
other
it
was
then
that
david
tripped
over
the
dragon
barbed
tail
david
squeaked
and
the
dragon
awoke
it
uncoiled
itself
suddenly
like
a
broken
spring
gosh
it
said
asleep
again
i
was
waiting
for
you
and
the
sun
on
my
back
always
makes
me
sleepy
i
am
the
foreman
higgins
telephoned
that
you
were
coming
it
preceded
her
through
the
little
green
archway
that
led
to
the
farm
the
sight
reminded
sarah
brown
of
watching
from
golders
green
tube
station
the
train
one
has
just
missed
dive
into
the
tunnel
she
followed
on
the
other
side
of
the
archway
the
whole
view
of
the
plain
called
higgins
farm
met
the
adventurer
the
were
heaped
graciously
together
on
a
little
wave
in
the
sea
of
ploughed
fields
except
for
two
pale
ricks
in
their
midst
they
exactly
matched
their
surroundings
they
were
plastered
dark
red
and
thatched
with
very
old
green
and
brown
thatch
beyond
the
buildings
was
a
little
wood
its
interior
lighted
up
with
bluebells
and
this
wood
merged
into
an
orchard
where
a
white
pony
and
an
auburn
pig
strove
apparently
to
eat
the
same
blade
of
grass
the
various
sections
of
the
farm
land
lay
mapped
out
in
different
intensities
of
brown
very
young
green
and
maturer
green
and
each
section
was
dotted
with
people
they
seemed
small
people
even
from
a
distance
and
as
sarah
brown
advanced
at
the
tail
of
the
dragon
she
saw
that
the
workers
were
all
indeed
under
ordinary
human
size
the
tallest
a
man
guiding
a
miniature
plough
behind
a
tall
horse
might
have
reached
sarah
brown
shoulder
none
of
them
seemed
hard
at
work
they
stood
talking
in
little
groups
one
group
as
they
passed
it
was
trafficking
in
cigarette
cards
i
want
to
get
my
gold
scale
set
of
english
kings
complete
a
voice
was
saying
tragically
has
nobody
got
edward
the
confessor
none
of
them
took
any
notice
of
the
foreman
i
afraid
i
have
got
the
gift
of
discipline
sighed
the
dragon
and
fairies
are
of
course
abnormally
undisciplined
creatures
still
we
simply
ca
get
any
one
else
and
higgins
will
not
apply
for
a
few
german
prisoners
get
on
with
your
work
you
people
do
there
you
see
they
defy
me
to
an
extent
ever
since
the
cowmen
dipped
me
in
the
my
authority
gone
gone
where
the
good
niggers
go
i
find
that
there
are
quite
a
lot
of
people
who
can
not
say
the
word
gone
without
adding
the
clause
about
the
good
niggers
these
people
have
vague
minds
sown
like
an
allotment
with
phrases
in
grooves
directly
the
dragon
said
to
an
extent
without
qualifying
the
extent
one
saw
why
it
had
no
gift
of
discipline
i
would
attempt
this
job
it
continued
winding
breathlessly
along
the
rutty
road
only
i
am
under
a
great
obligation
to
richard
higgins
i
am
a
of
his
you
know
he
rescued
me
from
a
lot
of
mischievous
knights
who
were
persecuting
me
one
of
them
had
tied
his
tin
hat
to
my
tail
i
remember
and
the
rest
were
trying
to
stick
their
nasty
spears
between
my
scales
really
you
know
it
was
quite
dangerous
i
have
known
a
fellow
eye
put
out
that
way
i
am
not
very
good
at
fighting
though
i
might
have
tackled
one
at
a
time
richard
higgins
rode
right
into
the
midst
of
them
knocking
them
right
and
left
gosh
he
gave
them
a
talking
to
and
they
slank
away
he
took
my
case
up
after
that
made
enquiries
and
gave
me
this
job
we
scrape
along
somehow
but
i
afraid
i
not
really
suited
for
it
they
reached
a
part
of
a
field
in
which
broad
beans
were
enjoying
an
innocent
childhood
among
white
butterflies
if
you
would
mind
said
the
dragon
shyly
i
should
like
you
to
hoe
between
the
rows
of
these
beans
you
will
find
a
hoe
against
the
big
stack
this
is
your
row
i
reserved
it
for
you
all
the
other
rows
were
occupied
by
fairy
women
with
their
skirts
tucked
up
for
only
your
amateur
wears
breeches
they
all
had
hoes
but
were
not
using
them
much
they
were
singing
curious
old
round
songs
like
summer
dreams
you
could
hear
strange
fragments
of
phrases
passing
from
voice
to
voice
they
took
no
notice
of
sarah
brown
and
she
began
to
work
oh
my
one
she
said
to
david
how
happy
this
is
no
wonder
they
sing
any
one
must
sing
working
like
this
in
great
fields
why
i
even
remember
that
the
shropshire
lad
whistled
once
by
mistake
while
ploughing
on
his
own
admission
until
a
fatalistic
blackbird
recalled
him
to
his
usual
tragic
mind
david
sat
uncomfortably
on
a
broad
bean
protesting
against
this
new
mania
for
a
moment
he
had
thought
that
she
was
seeking
for
a
mouse
with
some
patent
implement
he
had
even
tried
to
help
her
and
turned
over
a
clod
with
a
critical
paw
but
one
sniff
had
showed
him
the
empty
futility
of
the
thing
sarah
brown
hoed
rather
happily
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
then
she
began
to
count
the
beans
still
waiting
trustfully
in
the
queue
waiting
to
be
attended
to
and
freed
from
their
embarrassments
there
were
she
decided
standing
up
ostensibly
to
greet
an
aeroplane
she
became
very
glad
of
the
occasional
aeroplanes
that
crossed
above
her
field
and
gave
her
an
excuse
for
standing
with
a
straight
back
to
watch
them
aeroplanes
crossing
singly
or
in
formations
are
so
common
in
the
sky
of
faery
that
every
one
in
those
parts
while
turning
his
own
eyes
inevitably
upwards
secretly
thinks
his
neighbour
lamentably
rustic
and
unsophisticated
for
looking
at
them
every
aeroplane
that
crosses
faery
feels
i
suppose
the
reflected
magic
from
the
land
below
for
there
is
never
one
with
the
barest
minute
to
spare
that
does
not
pause
and
try
to
be
clever
over
higgins
farm
you
may
see
one
industriously
climbing
the
clouds
over
the
enchanted
forest
evidently
trying
hard
to
be
intent
on
its
destination
you
may
see
it
falter
struggling
with
its
sense
of
duty
and
then
break
weakly
into
a
mild
figure
eight
the
ragged
rooks
of
faery
at
once
hurry
into
the
air
to
show
their
laborious
imitator
how
this
should
be
done
the
spirit
of
frivolous
competition
enters
into
the
aeroplane
its
duty
is
flung
to
the
winds
it
flaunts
itself
up
and
down
once
or
twice
as
if
to
say
now
look
everybody
i
going
to
be
clever
then
it
goes
mad
it
leaps
upon
imaginary
boches
it
stands
upon
its
head
and
falls
downward
until
the
very
butterflies
begin
to
take
cover
it
stands
upon
its
tail
and
falls
upward
it
writes
messages
in
a
flowing
hand
across
the
sky
and
returns
to
cross
the
t
it
circles
impertinently
round
your
head
fixing
its
bold
tricolour
eye
upon
you
until
you
begin
to
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
your
appearance
it
bounds
upon
a
field
of
onions
and
rebounds
in
the
same
breath
from
the
topmost
cloud
of
heaven
the
rooks
return
disconsolately
to
their
nests
then
you
may
see
the
erring
machine
suddenly
remember
itself
and
check
itself
in
the
act
of
some
new
paroxysm
it
remembers
the
european
war
that
gave
it
birth
it
thinks
of
its
mates
scanning
the
sky
for
its
coming
its
frivolity
ebbs
suddenly
the
eastern
sky
becomes
once
more
its
highway
instead
of
its
trapeze
it
collects
its
wits
emits
a
few
contrite
bubbles
of
smoke
and
leaps
beyond
sight
whenever
this
happened
the
female
fairies
behaved
in
a
very
plebeian
and
forward
manner
waving
their
hoes
at
each
machine
encouraging
it
by
brazen
gestures
to
further
extravagances
and
striving
to
reach
its
hearing
with
loud
shrill
cries
there
was
very
little
difference
between
these
fairies
and
other
lady
in
fact
they
were
only
distinguishable
by
their
stature
and
by
the
empty
and
innocent
expression
of
their
faces
also
perhaps
by
their
tuneful
singing
and
by
a
habit
of
breaking
out
suddenly
into
country
dances
between
the
sarah
brown
who
worked
a
great
deal
more
industriously
than
any
one
else
in
sight
soon
overtook
them
and
while
conscious
of
that
touch
of
interested
scorn
always
felt
by
the
one
towards
the
herd
found
relief
in
watching
their
vagaries
and
presently
in
speaking
to
them
for
she
needed
relief
poor
sarah
brown
her
disabilities
were
catching
her
up
a
hoarse
contralto
cough
was
reminding
her
of
many
warnings
against
manual
work
she
could
feel
so
to
speak
the
distant
approaching
tramp
of
that
pain
in
her
side
under
whose
threat
she
had
lived
all
her
life
but
there
were
beans
yet
the
note
of
her
hoe
a
high
note
not
quite
true
pitched
clamoured
monotonously
upon
her
brain
three
blisters
and
a
half
were
persecuting
her
hands
let
them
blist
she
said
defiantly
this
row
of
beans
was
given
me
to
hoe
and
death
itself
shall
not
take
it
from
me
she
could
almost
imagine
she
saw
death
waiting
for
her
tactfully
beyond
the
last
bean
she
had
no
sense
of
proportion
she
was
so
very
weary
of
having
her
life
interrupted
by
her
weakness
that
anything
that
she
had
begun
to
do
always
seemed
to
her
worth
finishing
even
under
torture
to
finish
every
task
in
spite
of
all
hindrance
was
her
only
ambition
but
it
was
almost
always
frustrated
seventy
more
beans
three
score
and
ten
thought
sarah
brown
that
only
a
lifetime
she
bent
to
her
work
a
great
clump
of
buttercups
bestrode
her
bean
row
and
as
after
a
struggle
she
dragged
its
protesting
roots
from
the
earth
something
fell
from
it
oh
a
nest
she
gasped
look
i
have
hoed
up
a
nest
good
gracious
exclaimed
a
fairy
look
what
she
done
clement
nest
poor
chap
he
only
married
in
february
say
girls
here
clement
gone
up
cries
of
consternation
were
heard
from
every
clement
nest
was
really
almost
more
than
it
had
been
but
lightly
wedged
between
two
buttercup
stalks
the
two
eggs
in
it
were
at
once
unseated
and
one
was
broken
sarah
brown
was
deeply
distressed
what
a
blind
fool
i
am
she
said
trying
helplessly
to
replace
the
nest
wo
clement
ever
come
back
clement
wo
said
the
nearest
fairy
she
is
almost
hysterical
about
the
sanctity
of
the
home
and
all
that
she
probably
get
a
divorce
now
oh
poor
clement
poor
clement
said
sarah
brown
will
he
be
terribly
cut
up
there
he
is
replied
the
fairy
pointing
upward
he
watching
you
that
clement
voice
you
hear
clement
voice
exclaimed
sarah
brown
singing
like
that
why
he
sounds
perfectly
happy
perfectly
happy
mocked
the
fairy
his
family
only
sings
like
that
when
it
upset
perfectly
happy
indeed
ca
you
understand
tragedy
when
you
hear
it
sarah
brown
with
despairing
care
tucked
the
nest
up
under
a
bean
and
replaced
the
unbroken
egg
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
then
she
said
after
a
busy
painful
pause
that
shelley
probably
misunderstood
that
lark
he
wrote
a
poem
about
he
called
it
a
blithe
spirit
you
know
because
it
sang
do
you
suppose
it
was
one
certainly
not
said
the
fairy
i
do
know
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
but
without
a
doubt
your
friend
shelley
was
standing
on
the
unfortunate
bird
nest
all
the
time
he
was
writing
his
poem
sarah
brown
with
a
deep
sigh
began
hoeing
again
fifty
beans
yet
she
had
altogether
ceased
to
find
pleasure
in
the
day
pain
is
an
extinguisher
that
can
put
out
the
sun
she
had
ceased
to
find
pleasure
in
the
singing
of
the
birds
the
voice
of
the
pigeon
sounded
to
her
no
more
than
an
unbeautiful
falsetto
growl
she
was
irritated
by
the
fact
that
the
cuckoo
had
only
one
song
to
sing
she
tried
not
to
hoe
in
time
to
that
song
but
the
monotony
of
it
possessed
her
her
row
of
beans
stretched
in
front
of
her
right
across
the
world
every
time
she
looked
along
it
the
end
seemed
farther
away
every
time
she
raised
her
hoe
the
sword
of
pain
slipped
under
her
guard
the
dog
david
impatient
of
her
unnatural
taste
in
occupations
had
forsaken
her
she
could
trace
his
course
by
a
moving
ripple
across
the
potato
patch
just
as
a
shark
movement
seams
the
sea
forty
beans
time
wears
a
strangely
different
guise
out
of
doors
under
the
sun
time
stands
almost
still
only
when
every
minute
is
a
physical
effort
do
you
discover
that
there
really
are
sixty
minutes
in
an
hour
and
that
one
hour
is
very
little
nearer
to
the
evening
than
another
people
who
work
indoors
under
the
government
of
clocks
never
meet
time
face
to
face
their
quick
seconds
are
dismissed
by
the
clicking
of
typewriters
and
when
their
typewriters
fall
silent
their
day
is
over
we
of
out
of
doors
have
a
daily
eternity
to
contend
with
during
which
only
our
hands
are
busy
our
minds
may
grow
old
and
young
again
between
sunrise
and
sunset
the
future
may
be
remade
in
an
hour
hope
killed
and
reborn
before
a
blackbird
song
is
over
we
know
the
length
of
days
and
after
many
slow
months
of
stress
we
come
back
again
old
and
bewildered
with
much
silence
and
much
wondering
to
our
friends
in
offices
and
find
them
unchanged
floating
innocently
on
the
surface
of
time
sarah
brown
dropped
her
hoe
and
fell
upon
her
knees
i
ca
hoe
any
more
she
said
there
are
more
beans
but
i
ca
hoe
them
why
should
you
asked
the
nearest
fairy
indifferently
the
foreman
never
notices
if
we
shirk
we
always
do
i
said
i
would
hoe
this
row
said
sarah
brown
but
i
am
accursed
it
is
a
good
thing
at
least
to
know
one
limitations
even
in
affliction
she
was
prosy
i
would
advise
you
to
go
and
have
your
dinner
another
fairy
said
only
that
i
ate
your
sandwiches
as
i
passed
just
now
but
i
left
a
little
lemonade
in
your
bottle
go
under
the
trees
and
drink
it
i
ca
move
said
sarah
brown
sit
there
then
said
the
fairies
and
passed
on
tickling
but
not
uprooting
the
weeds
in
their
rows
fairies
are
never
ill
they
have
immortal
bodies
but
no
souls
if
they
see
you
in
pain
they
simply
think
you
are
flaunting
your
superiority
and
your
immortal
soul
in
their
faces
the
dragon
undulated
up
the
field
very
nicely
hoed
he
said
looking
vaguely
at
sarah
brown
row
much
better
than
the
other
rows
having
your
dinner
quite
right
too
he
never
noticed
the
unhoed
beans
sarah
brown
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
shore
of
green
shadow
and
a
sea
of
sun
speckled
with
buttercups
was
before
her
david
blessing
came
and
leaned
against
her
his
first
intentions
were
good
he
kissed
her
hurriedly
on
the
chin
but
after
that
he
kissed
the
sandwich
bag
sarah
brown
wondered
whether
she
could
cut
her
throat
with
a
hoe
suicide
while
of
sound
mind
she
said
the
said
mind
being
entirely
sick
of
its
unsound
body
if
she
sat
absolutely
still
and
upright
the
pain
was
bearable
but
even
to
think
of
movement
brought
tears
of
pain
to
her
eyes
she
detached
her
mind
from
her
predicament
and
sank
into
a
warm
tropical
sea
of
thought
she
was
no
real
thinker
but
she
thought
much
about
thinking
and
was
passionately
interested
in
watching
her
own
mind
at
work
thought
was
like
sleep
to
her
she
sank
deeply
into
it
without
reaching
anything
profound
nothing
resulted
but
useless
dreams
and
a
certain
comforting
and
defiant
intimacy
with
herself
she
thought
of
richard
and
wished
that
she
could
have
hoed
a
blessing
into
every
bean
of
his
that
she
had
hoed
she
noted
and
without
surprise
that
the
thought
of
him
was
beautiful
to
her
she
could
not
conjure
up
his
face
before
her
mind
because
she
always
forgot
realities
and
only
remembered
dreams
she
could
not
imagine
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
could
not
recall
anything
that
he
had
said
yet
she
felt
again
the
magic
feeling
of
meeting
him
and
dreamt
of
all
the
things
that
might
have
happened
and
that
might
yet
happen
yet
never
would
happen
between
him
and
her
all
the
best
things
that
she
remembered
had
only
happened
in
her
dreams
her
imagination
no
sooner
sipped
the
first
sip
of
an
experience
than
it
conjured
up
for
her
great
absurd
satisfying
draughts
of
nectar
for
which
the
waking
sarah
brown
might
thirst
in
vain
but
there
was
no
waking
sarah
brown
her
life
was
only
a
only
very
rarely
did
she
awake
for
a
moment
and
feel
ashamed
to
see
how
alert
was
the
world
about
her
so
she
thought
of
richard
not
of
richard
richard
but
of
some
pale
private
richard
of
her
own
the
approach
of
richard
upon
a
white
horse
for
some
time
seemed
only
an
extension
of
her
dream
it
was
only
when
she
realised
that
he
was
riding
up
her
and
partially
undoing
the
work
of
her
hoe
that
she
awoke
suddenly
with
a
start
and
caught
and
tore
her
breath
upon
a
pin
of
pain
it
seemed
that
the
afternoon
had
now
long
possessed
the
fields
it
had
wakened
into
a
live
and
electric
blue
the
enchanted
forest
which
she
had
last
noticed
shimmering
in
its
noon
green
all
the
workers
at
the
approach
of
richard
were
working
busily
bent
ostentatiously
in
the
form
of
hairpins
up
and
down
their
rows
the
dragon
was
rippling
anxiously
along
at
the
heels
of
the
white
horse
a
helpless
hoping
for
the
best
expressed
itself
in
every
spike
along
his
spine
i
do
really
know
why
she
idling
like
that
sarah
brown
heard
him
say
in
his
breathy
pathetic
voice
i
left
her
hard
at
work
they
all
the
same
when
my
back
turned
a
fellow
needs
to
have
eyes
at
the
tip
of
his
tail
are
you
suffering
from
that
leverhulme
sort
of
feeling
asked
richard
politely
of
sarah
brown
in
the
manner
of
an
advertisement
of
a
cure
for
indigestion
as
he
approached
i
think
just
splendid
how
receptive
and
progressive
working
people
are
in
these
days
i
was
meditating
suicide
replied
sarah
brown
candidly
if
faintly
i
am
a
stricken
and
useless
parasite
on
the
face
of
your
fine
earth
but
my
hoe
is
too
blunt
i
have
a
with
three
blades
i
could
lend
you
said
richard
slapping
himself
enquiringly
over
several
pockets
or
would
you
rather
try
a
natty
little
spell
i
thought
of
this
morning
while
i
was
shaving
i
think
any
one
stricken
might
find
it
rather
useful
ah
give
it
to
me
give
it
to
me
said
sarah
brown
the
pain
was
like
a
wave
breaking
upon
her
carrying
her
away
from
her
safe
shore
of
shadow
to
be
lost
in
seething
and
suffocating
seas
without
rest
her
eyes
felt
dried
up
with
fever
and
whenever
she
shut
them
the
darkness
was
filled
with
a
jumble
of
nauseating
squares
in
blue
upon
a
background
the
smell
of
beans
was
terrible
richard
fumbled
with
something
very
badly
folded
up
in
newspaper
he
also
tried
ineffectively
to
light
a
match
by
wiping
it
helplessly
against
his
riding
breeches
he
seemed
to
have
none
of
the
small
skill
in
details
that
comes
to
most
people
before
they
grow
up
he
did
everything
as
if
he
were
doing
it
for
the
first
time
i
had
nothing
but
the
to
wrap
it
in
he
murmured
afraid
that
may
have
spoilt
the
magic
a
little
it
was
the
dragon
finally
who
produced
the
necessary
light
after
watching
richard
with
the
anxious
sympathy
of
one
ineffectual
for
another
it
said
let
me
and
kindly
breathed
out
a
little
flame
which
set
the
packet
aflare
for
a
moment
the
ashes
fluttered
down
from
richard
hand
among
the
beans
and
a
thin
violet
stalk
of
smoke
went
up
sarah
brown
smelt
the
unmistakable
sour
smell
of
magic
and
saw
soundless
words
moving
richard
little
khaki
moustache
then
she
found
that
she
had
disappeared
she
had
never
done
this
before
she
had
always
been
present
to
disturb
and
interrupt
herself
she
had
never
seen
the
world
before
except
through
the
little
glazed
peepholes
called
eyes
through
which
her
everyday
self
rather
wistfully
believed
that
it
could
see
now
of
course
she
knew
what
seeing
was
and
for
the
first
time
she
was
aware
of
the
real
sizes
of
things
poor
man
measures
all
things
by
the
size
of
his
own
foot
he
looks
complacently
at
the
print
of
his
boot
in
the
mud
and
notices
that
the
ant
which
he
crushed
was
not
nearly
as
big
as
his
foot
therefore
the
ant
does
not
matter
to
him
he
also
notices
that
those
same
feet
of
his
would
not
be
able
to
walk
to
the
moon
within
a
reasonable
time
therefore
the
moon
does
not
matter
to
him
but
sarah
brown
had
disappeared
and
therefore
could
not
measure
anything
the
spider
strode
from
hill
to
hill
with
the
wind
rushing
through
the
hair
on
his
back
the
blue
sky
was
just
a
lampshade
clipped
on
to
the
earth
to
shield
it
from
the
glare
of
the
gods
beyond
it
was
a
mere
roof
of
eternity
pricked
with
a
few
billion
stars
to
keep
it
well
ventilated
sarah
brown
had
for
a
while
all
the
fun
of
being
a
god
she
was
nowhere
and
she
was
everywhere
she
could
have
counted
the
hairs
on
head
the
world
waved
like
a
flower
upon
a
thin
purple
stalk
of
smoke
her
eyes
began
to
see
again
she
was
aware
of
the
hollowed
tired
eyes
of
richard
fixed
upon
her
the
dragon
dawned
once
more
upon
her
sight
it
was
inquisitively
watching
developments
while
pretending
to
claw
a
weed
or
two
out
of
a
neighbouring
the
horizon
was
rusty
with
a
rather
heavy
sunset
the
fields
were
full
of
twilight
and
empty
of
fairies
sarah
brown
came
to
herself
with
a
start
she
was
shocked
to
find
that
she
had
opened
her
mouth
to
say
something
absolutely
impossible
to
richard
david
chin
was
resting
on
her
hand
her
side
felt
frozen
and
dangerous
but
not
painful
it
did
altogether
answer
said
richard
i
afraid
the
wrapping
was
a
mistake
a
spell
of
that
strength
ought
to
have
set
you
dancing
in
three
minutes
i
take
you
home
on
my
horse
his
name
is
vivian
the
horse
vivian
who
was
so
white
as
to
be
almost
phosphorescent
in
the
dusk
was
now
further
illuminated
by
a
little
red
light
on
his
breast
and
a
little
green
light
on
his
tail
richard
was
fond
of
making
elaborate
and
unnecessary
arrangements
like
this
while
neglecting
to
acquire
skill
in
the
more
usual
handicrafts
sarah
brown
a
person
of
little
weight
was
placed
astride
on
the
back
of
the
horse
vivian
richard
walked
beside
the
dragon
nodded
and
disappeared
into
its
home
a
low
barn
evidently
built
specially
for
it
with
a
door
at
each
end
and
a
conveniently
placed
chimney
which
enabled
it
to
breathe
enough
fire
to
cook
its
meals
without
suffocating
itself
sarah
brown
never
saw
the
dragon
again
but
it
stayed
always
in
her
memory
as
a
puzzled
soul
born
tragically
out
of
its
time
a
shorn
lamb
so
to
speak
to
whom
the
wind
had
not
been
sufficiently
tempered
now
this
ride
home
through
the
enchanted
forest
on
a
tall
horse
with
richard
walking
beside
her
was
the
most
perfect
hour
of
sarah
life
the
enchanted
forest
is
only
an
accumulation
of
dreams
and
from
every
traveller
through
it
it
exacts
toll
in
the
shape
of
a
dream
by
way
of
receipt
to
every
traveller
it
gives
a
darling
memory
that
neither
death
nor
hell
nor
paradise
can
efface
sarah
brown
knew
that
her
dream
and
richard
could
never
meet
the
fact
that
he
was
thinking
of
some
one
else
all
the
way
home
was
not
hidden
from
her
but
she
was
a
person
used
to
living
alone
she
could
enjoy
quite
lonely
romances
and
never
even
envy
real
women
whose
romances
were
always
made
for
two
she
was
not
a
real
woman
she
was
morbidly
bodiless
strange
though
it
may
seem
the
kind
awkward
touch
of
richard
as
he
had
lifted
her
on
to
the
horse
vivian
back
had
been
for
her
the
one
flaw
in
that
enchanted
ride
she
could
not
bear
touch
she
had
no
pleasure
in
seeing
or
feeling
the
skin
and
homespun
that
encloses
men
and
women
she
hated
to
watch
people
feeding
themselves
or
to
see
her
own
thin
body
in
the
mirror
she
ought
really
to
have
been
born
a
poplar
tree
a
human
body
was
a
gift
wasted
on
her
as
they
passed
along
the
green
ride
the
red
light
from
the
horse
vivian
neck
made
a
sort
of
heralding
ghost
before
them
on
the
grass
bats
darted
above
them
for
a
few
yards
at
a
time
and
were
twitched
aside
as
though
by
a
string
or
a
reminding
conscience
the
telegraph
wires
bound
for
the
post
office
of
faery
run
through
the
enchanted
forest
and
the
poles
in
the
faint
light
were
like
tall
crucifixes
a
long
way
off
through
the
opening
at
the
end
of
the
forest
were
the
little
lights
of
mitten
island
do
you
know
said
richard
and
this
is
unfortunately
the
sort
of
thing
that
young
men
do
say
at
silent
and
enchanted
moments
that
if
all
the
magic
in
this
forest
were
collected
together
and
compressed
into
a
liquid
form
it
would
be
enough
to
stop
the
war
in
one
moment
my
hat
said
sarah
brown
in
one
moment
in
one
moment
my
hat
said
sarah
brown
the
powers
of
magic
have
been
anything
like
thoroughly
estimated
even
yet
said
richard
i
suppose
the
war
was
made
by
black
magic
suggested
sarah
brown
trying
to
talk
intelligently
and
to
be
faithful
to
her
own
thoughts
at
the
same
time
good
lord
no
replied
richard
the
worst
of
this
war
is
that
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
magic
of
any
sort
it
was
made
and
is
supported
by
men
who
had
forgotten
magic
it
is
the
result
of
the
coming
to
an
end
of
a
spell
have
you
noticed
that
a
spell
came
to
an
end
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
why
does
almost
every
one
see
something
lacking
about
the
victorian
age
something
certainly
died
with
keats
and
shelley
sighed
sarah
brown
oh
well
said
richard
i
do
know
about
books
i
ca
read
you
know
but
obviously
what
was
wrong
with
the
last
century
was
just
that
it
did
believe
in
fairies
does
this
century
believe
in
fairies
if
the
spell
came
to
an
end
how
is
it
that
we
are
so
magic
now
this
century
knows
that
it
does
know
everything
said
richard
and
as
for
spells
we
have
started
a
new
spell
that
the
curious
part
of
this
war
so
gross
and
so
impossible
and
so
unmagic
was
its
cause
that
magic
which
had
been
virtually
dead
rose
again
to
meet
it
the
worse
a
world
grows
the
greater
will
magic
grow
to
save
it
magic
only
dies
in
a
tepid
world
i
think
there
is
now
more
magic
in
the
world
than
ever
before
the
soil
of
france
is
alive
with
it
and
as
for
belgium
when
belgium
gets
back
home
at
last
she
will
find
her
desecrated
house
enchanted
and
the
same
applies
to
all
the
thresholds
in
the
world
which
have
crossed
and
will
never
cross
again
except
in
the
dreams
of
their
friends
that
sort
of
austere
and
secret
magic
like
a
word
known
by
all
and
spoken
by
none
is
pretty
nearly
all
that
is
left
to
keep
the
world
alive
now
richard
seemed
to
be
becoming
less
and
less
of
a
man
and
more
and
more
of
a
wizard
the
farther
he
penetrated
into
the
enchanted
forest
he
was
saying
things
that
would
have
embarrassed
him
very
much
had
they
been
said
in
the
piccadilly
restaurant
even
after
three
glasses
of
champagne
for
this
reason
although
the
borders
of
the
enchanted
forest
are
said
to
be
widening
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
will
not
encroach
beyond
the
confines
of
the
parish
of
faery
what
would
happen
if
its
trees
began
to
seed
themselves
in
the
strand
imagine
the
stock
exchange
under
the
shadow
of
an
enchanted
oak
and
the
consequent
disastrous
wearing
thin
of
the
metal
casing
in
which
all
good
business
men
keep
their
souls
sarah
brown
thought
if
rather
a
curious
coincidence
that
so
soon
after
they
had
spoken
of
the
dead
keats
they
should
see
him
alive
they
saw
him
framed
in
a
little
pale
aisle
of
the
forest
a
faintly
defined
fragile
ghost
crouched
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
bent
awkwardly
into
an
attitude
of
pain
forgotten
and
ecstatic
attention
it
was
his
dearest
moment
that
they
saw
a
moment
without
death
for
he
was
a
prisoner
in
a
perfect
spell
he
was
utterly
entangled
in
the
looped
and
ensnaring
song
of
a
nightingale
the
song
was
like
beaten
gold
wire
never
again
in
her
life
did
sarah
brown
profane
with
her
poor
voice
the
words
that
a
perfect
singer
begot
in
a
marriage
with
a
perfect
song
but
in
unhappiness
and
in
the
horrible
nights
the
song
came
to
her
always
the
travellers
were
approaching
the
end
of
the
green
ride
but
that
did
not
matter
to
sarah
brown
for
there
had
been
nothing
lacking
all
the
way
love
began
richard
in
a
loud
exalted
voice
and
then
suddenly
a
searchlight
glared
diagonally
across
the
end
of
the
ride
over
mitten
island
and
quenched
the
magic
of
the
moment
sorry
said
richard
i
thought
i
was
talking
to
my
true
love
i
sorry
you
were
said
sarah
brown
as
they
emerged
from
the
forest
i
mean
i
sorry
it
was
only
me
you
were
talking
to
chapter
viii
the
regrettable
wednesday
what
a
very
singular
thing
said
the
mayor
meeting
the
witch
towards
three
in
the
afternoon
as
she
came
down
the
broad
walk
towards
kensington
having
slept
invisibly
among
the
daffodils
for
nearly
twelve
hours
a
really
very
singular
thing
is
once
in
five
years
i
visit
these
parts
and
now
i
here
i
meet
the
very
person
i
was
thinkin
about
he
winked
it
almost
like
magic
is
it
said
the
witch
winking
busily
in
return
well
i
done
what
you
told
me
to
said
the
mayor
what
was
that
you
will
your
joke
he
retorted
indulgently
pretending
not
to
know
indeed
i
done
what
you
told
me
the
other
day
when
you
came
to
that
committee
with
your
cat
i
thought
it
over
i
not
a
proud
man
never
above
takin
a
hint
and
i
admitted
to
meself
that
what
you
said
was
fair
about
makin
money
i
never
thought
but
what
money
was
the
first
thing
to
make
in
business
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
always
thought
it
rather
a
feather
in
my
cap
that
i
never
took
advantage
of
brown
borough
customers
in
selling
adulterated
goods
for
lawdy
swallow
anythink
it
different
with
your
business
bein
in
an
locality
prices
i
thought
was
only
natural
make
while
the
sun
shines
was
my
motter
and
i
says
to
meself
there
was
no
reason
why
this
war
should
make
as
for
lookin
at
the
grocery
business
as
a
trust
from
god
like
you
said
i
never
dremp
of
such
a
thing
although
i
bin
to
chapel
regular
for
ten
years
but
i
see
now
there
was
a
lot
in
what
you
said
and
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
there
was
no
need
to
make
such
a
terrible
lot
of
extra
hay
much
the
sun
might
be
shinin
when
you
put
it
like
that
i
could
say
why
i
was
so
set
on
more
money
quite
enough
well
i
says
to
meself
after
shutting
meself
up
to
think
it
out
like
you
said
am
i
giving
up
all
my
life
an
all
my
jolly
days
an
an
damned
if
i
know
what
for
for
money
just
money
stewin
in
its
own
juice
in
a
bank
not
money
i
can
use
well
everybody
trained
so
thinkin
anyway
i
took
it
friendly
of
you
to
put
it
so
delicate
so
fanciful
as
you
did
so
as
them
charity
ladies
did
smell
a
rat
i
appreciated
that
an
thought
the
more
of
what
you
said
i
not
a
proud
man
you
just
proud
enough
said
the
witch
you
a
darling
if
ever
i
can
help
you
in
a
business
way
let
me
know
if
you
want
to
start
a
side
line
for
instance
in
happiness
i
can
give
you
a
tip
where
to
get
it
wholesale
within
limits
it
go
like
wildfire
in
the
brown
borough
if
you
put
in
an
ounce
or
two
gratis
of
course
with
every
order
you
will
your
joke
murmured
the
mayor
but
i
like
it
in
you
i
a
man
that
never
takes
a
joke
amiss
let
go
for
a
walk
together
no
said
the
witch
i
am
so
hungry
that
my
ribs
are
beginning
to
bend
inwards
i
must
go
and
have
sausages
and
mash
and
two
apple
dumplings
they
found
themselves
presently
seated
at
the
table
of
an
after
an
interval
that
could
hardly
be
accurately
described
as
presently
sausages
and
mash
dawned
on
the
horizon
and
the
witch
waved
her
fork
rudely
at
it
as
it
approached
mashed
is
splendid
stuff
to
sculp
with
she
said
roughing
in
a
ground
plan
upon
her
plate
with
the
sure
carelessness
of
the
artist
this
is
going
to
be
an
ivory
castle
built
upon
a
rock
in
a
glassy
sea
the
sausage
is
the
dragon
guarding
it
and
this
little
crumb
of
bread
is
the
emprisoned
princess
a
dull
but
sterling
creature
look
miss
watkins
interrupted
the
mayor
i
not
as
a
rule
an
impulsive
man
and
i
do
want
to
startle
you
how
mean
startle
me
asked
the
witch
you
have
startled
me
at
all
but
the
fact
is
i
never
have
been
much
of
a
person
for
getting
married
thank
you
very
much
i
an
awful
bad
and
i
so
much
enjoy
having
no
money
well
i
blessed
exclaimed
the
mayor
you
a
perfect
witch
i
declare
he
laid
a
large
hand
upon
hers
but
you
know
you
ca
put
the
lid
on
me
so
easy
as
that
ever
since
you
came
into
that
old
committee
room
i
saw
there
was
something
particular
about
you
something
that
you
an
me
in
common
i
not
speakin
so
much
of
us
bein
in
the
same
line
of
business
oh
it
all
let
get
out
of
this
and
take
a
taxi
i
not
a
kissing
man
but
he
seemed
very
persistent
in
applying
negatived
adjectives
to
himself
it
was
not
his
fault
if
the
world
failed
to
grasp
exactly
what
he
was
or
rather
exactly
what
he
was
not
i
have
often
wondered
interrupted
the
witch
talking
of
kissing
what
would
happen
if
two
snipes
wanted
to
kiss
each
other
it
would
have
to
be
at
such
awfully
long
range
would
it
or
come
off
it
ordered
the
mayor
irritably
what
about
gettin
out
of
this
and
do
you
think
this
is
becoming
rather
a
tiresome
scene
said
the
witch
somehow
over
luscious
do
you
think
i
wish
those
apple
dumplings
would
hurry
up
miss
said
the
mayor
ungraciously
to
a
passing
whirlwind
them
dumplings
them
dumplings
echoed
the
whirlwind
to
a
little
hole
in
the
wall
the
witch
had
a
silly
vision
of
two
distressed
dumplings
like
dilatory
chorus
girls
mad
with
the
nightmare
feeling
of
not
being
dressed
in
time
hearing
their
cue
called
in
a
heartless
voice
from
the
inexorable
sky
desperately
applying
the
last
dab
of
flour
to
their
imperfect
complexions
but
the
witch
found
no
fault
with
them
when
they
came
she
gave
them
her
whole
attention
for
some
minutes
well
well
she
said
laying
down
her
fork
and
spoon
that
good
i
feel
awfully
having
had
a
proposal
when
real
girls
ask
me
now
how
many
i
had
i
shall
be
able
to
say
one
but
i
met
a
girl
the
other
day
who
had
had
six
she
had
six
photographs
but
she
called
them
scalps
if
you
would
give
me
your
photograph
i
could
label
it
a
scalp
and
hang
it
in
the
shop
that
would
be
very
would
it
you
will
your
joke
said
the
mayor
in
a
hollow
voice
i
never
met
such
a
gurl
as
you
for
a
bit
of
fun
i
do
believe
you
got
any
there
of
course
he
was
right
a
heart
is
a
sort
of
degree
conferred
by
providence
on
those
who
have
passed
a
certain
examination
magic
people
are
only
freshmen
in
our
college
and
it
is
useless
for
us
secure
in
the
possession
of
many
learned
letters
after
our
names
to
despise
them
they
will
become
sophisticated
in
due
course
how
mean
heart
asked
the
witch
therefore
i
still
got
an
awful
hunger
inside
me
if
that
anything
to
do
with
it
i
tell
you
what
it
wednesday
let
go
and
call
on
miss
ford
she
might
have
grassy
sandwiches
there
was
a
most
abrupt
and
disturbing
draught
in
miss
ford
sleek
and
decorous
flat
as
the
witch
and
the
mayor
entered
it
the
serenity
of
the
night
and
the
morning
had
been
suddenly
obliterated
and
kensington
suffered
a
gust
or
two
of
gritty
wind
which
blew
the
babies
home
from
the
gardens
and
kept
all
the
in
the
high
street
on
the
alert
with
their
fingers
on
the
triggers
of
their
umbrellas
but
no
rain
fell
rain
can
not
fall
in
this
book
of
fine
weather
the
draught
that
intruded
into
the
flat
ruffled
the
neat
hair
of
five
persons
miss
ford
herself
lady
arabel
higgins
miss
ivy
macbee
bernard
tovey
and
darnby
frere
miss
macbee
always
seemed
to
be
seated
on
tenterhooks
even
in
the
most
comfortable
of
chairs
her
spartan
spine
never
consented
graciously
to
the
curves
of
cushions
she
had
smooth
padded
hair
and
smooth
padded
manners
and
her
eyes
were
magnified
by
thick
to
a
size
most
people
especially
most
women
were
instinctively
sorry
for
her
because
she
always
looked
a
little
clever
and
very
uncomfortable
bernard
tovey
was
a
beaming
person
he
leaned
forward
abruptly
whenever
he
spoke
thereby
swinging
a
lock
of
hair
into
his
right
eye
he
agreed
so
heartily
with
everything
that
was
said
that
people
who
addressed
him
were
left
with
the
happy
impression
that
they
had
said
something
rather
good
this
habit
combined
with
the
fact
that
he
never
launched
an
independent
remark
had
given
him
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
best
talkers
in
kensington
darnby
frere
was
the
editor
of
an
advanced
religious
paper
called
but
he
never
wondered
really
he
knew
almost
everything
and
therefore
while
despising
the
public
for
knowing
so
little
he
encouraged
it
to
continue
wondering
so
that
he
might
continue
despising
and
instructing
it
now
it
was
an
almost
unprecedented
thing
for
two
members
of
the
small
class
to
come
into
miss
ford
especially
on
a
wednesday
the
utmost
social
mingling
of
the
classes
that
those
walls
had
ever
seen
was
the
moment
when
miss
ford
asked
the
electric
light
man
what
he
thought
of
the
war
the
electric
light
man
reply
had
been
quoted
in
the
dialect
on
two
or
three
of
the
following
wednesdays
as
a
proof
of
miss
ford
daring
intimacy
with
men
in
another
station
of
life
really
it
would
have
been
simpler
though
of
course
not
so
picturesque
to
have
quoted
it
direct
from
its
original
source
the
electric
light
man
bible
the
entrance
of
the
witch
and
the
mayor
was
to
a
certain
extent
a
crisis
but
miss
ford
kept
her
head
and
her
three
friends
though
grasping
at
once
the
extraordinary
situation
did
not
give
way
to
panic
well
well
well
said
the
mayor
looking
round
and
breathing
very
loudly
this
is
a
cosy
little
nook
you
got
he
was
not
at
all
at
his
ease
but
being
a
business
man
and
being
also
blessed
with
a
peculiarly
inexpressive
face
he
was
successfully
dissembling
his
discomfort
for
it
had
happened
that
the
lift
had
been
one
of
those
lifts
that
can
do
no
wrong
the
kind
that
the
public
is
indulgently
allowed
to
work
by
itself
and
the
mayor
looking
upon
this
fact
as
specially
planned
by
a
propitious
god
of
love
had
tried
to
kiss
the
witch
as
they
shot
up
the
darkened
shaft
if
i
remind
you
that
the
witch
was
still
accompanied
by
her
broomstick
harold
a
creature
of
unreasoning
fidelity
i
need
hardly
describe
the
scene
further
the
mayor
stepped
out
of
the
lift
with
a
tingling
scraped
face
and
if
he
had
possessed
enough
hair
on
his
head
it
would
have
been
on
end
as
it
was
when
the
lift
stopped
he
retrieved
his
hat
from
the
floor
with
a
frank
oath
and
as
the
witch
had
at
once
rung
the
bell
of
miss
ford
flat
he
instinctively
followed
her
across
that
threshold
she
looked
round
in
the
hall
and
said
with
a
friendly
smile
afraid
harold
gets
a
bit
irritable
sometimes
i
often
tell
him
to
count
ten
before
he
lets
himself
go
but
he
forgets
did
he
hurt
you
i
am
afraid
the
angry
mayor
did
not
give
harold
credit
for
much
initiative
kissing
is
such
a
funny
habit
is
it
said
the
witch
briskly
as
she
shook
miss
ford
hand
i
wonder
who
decided
in
the
first
place
which
forms
of
contact
should
express
which
forms
of
emotion
i
wonder
she
interrupted
herself
as
her
eyes
fell
on
some
green
sandwiches
which
were
occupying
the
third
floor
of
a
wicker
eiffel
tower
beside
miss
ford
oh
how
gorgeous
she
said
do
you
know
i
only
had
two
meals
in
the
last
two
days
nobody
present
had
ever
been
obliged
to
miss
a
meal
so
this
statement
seemed
to
every
one
to
be
a
message
from
another
world
you
must
tell
us
about
all
your
experiences
my
dear
miss
watkins
said
miss
ford
leading
the
witch
towards
a
chair
by
the
fire
the
witch
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
leaving
her
rather
embarrassed
hostess
in
the
air
so
to
speak
towering
rigidly
above
her
how
mean
experiences
said
the
witch
after
eating
one
sandwich
in
silent
ecstasy
i
was
up
in
the
sky
last
night
talking
to
a
german
was
that
an
experience
the
sky
last
night
was
surely
no
place
for
a
lady
said
frere
with
rather
sour
joviality
oh
i
know
what
she
means
said
miss
macbee
earnestly
i
was
up
in
the
sky
last
night
too
great
scott
exclaimed
the
witch
but
yes
i
was
persisted
miss
macbee
i
lay
on
the
hammock
which
i
have
had
slung
in
my
cellar
and
shut
my
eyes
and
loosed
my
spirit
and
it
shot
upward
like
a
lark
released
it
detached
itself
from
the
common
trammels
of
the
body
yes
my
spirit
in
shining
armour
fought
with
the
false
cruel
spirits
of
murderers
i
had
got
any
shining
armour
sighed
the
witch
who
had
been
looking
a
little
puzzled
but
i
had
the
hell
of
a
wrangle
with
a
boche
witch
who
came
over
we
fought
till
we
fell
off
our
broomsticks
and
then
she
quoted
the
at
me
and
then
she
fell
through
a
hole
and
broke
her
back
over
the
cross
on
st
paul
it
was
miss
macbee
turn
to
look
puzzled
but
she
said
to
miss
ford
my
dear
you
have
brought
us
a
real
mystic
frere
though
emitting
an
applauding
murmur
leaned
back
and
fixed
his
face
in
the
ambiguous
expression
of
one
who
while
listening
with
interest
to
the
conversation
of
liars
is
determined
not
to
appear
deceived
how
mean
mystic
asked
the
witch
i
do
think
i
can
have
made
myself
clear
excuse
me
she
added
to
miss
ford
but
this
room
smells
awfully
clever
to
any
one
coming
in
from
outside
do
you
mind
if
i
dance
a
little
to
move
the
air
about
we
shall
be
delighted
said
miss
ford
indulgently
shall
i
play
for
you
the
witch
did
not
answer
she
rose
and
as
she
rose
she
threw
a
little
white
paper
packet
into
the
fire
she
danced
round
the
sofa
and
the
chairs
the
floor
shook
a
little
and
all
her
watchers
twisted
their
necks
gravely
like
lizards
watching
an
active
fly
the
by
appearing
in
the
doorway
with
an
inaudible
announcement
diverted
their
attention
though
she
did
not
interrupt
the
witch
exercises
a
very
man
came
in
darnby
frere
who
was
a
student
of
henry
james
works
and
therefore
constantly
made
elaborate
guesses
on
matters
that
did
not
concern
him
and
then
forgot
them
because
unlike
james
guesses
they
were
always
wrong
gave
the
newcomer
credit
for
being
perhaps
a
shopwalker
or
perhaps
a
and
chatham
but
surely
a
at
any
rate
the
stranger
looked
ill
at
ease
and
especially
disconcerted
by
the
sight
of
the
dancing
witch
miss
ford
realised
by
now
that
her
wednesday
had
for
some
reason
gone
mad
she
had
lost
her
hold
on
the
reins
of
that
usually
dignified
equipage
there
was
nothing
now
for
her
to
do
but
to
grip
tight
and
keep
her
head
she
therefore
concealed
her
ignorance
of
her
newest
guest
identity
she
stiffened
her
lips
and
poured
out
another
cup
of
tea
with
a
nerveless
hand
the
stranger
took
the
cup
of
tea
with
some
relief
and
said
thenk
you
meddem
the
witch
stopped
dancing
and
stood
in
front
of
the
newcomer
chair
i
think
yours
must
be
a
discouraging
job
she
said
to
him
getting
people
punished
for
doing
things
you
love
to
do
yourself
oh
awfully
discouraging
and
do
tell
me
there
a
little
problem
that
been
on
my
mind
ever
since
the
war
started
i
hear
that
hindenburg
says
the
german
army
intends
to
march
through
london
the
moment
it
can
brush
away
the
obstacles
in
front
of
it
have
you
considered
what
will
happen
to
the
traffic
because
you
know
germans
on
principle
march
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
indeed
everybody
in
the
world
does
except
the
conscientious
british
think
of
the
knotted
convulsions
of
traffic
at
the
bank
with
a
hundred
thousand
boches
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
think
of
poor
thin
fleet
street
and
the
dam
that
would
occur
in
piccadilly
circus
what
do
you
policemen
intend
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
i
sure
miss
said
the
newcomer
coldly
it
a
long
time
since
i
was
on
point
duty
i
a
plain
clothes
man
meddem
he
added
to
miss
ford
i
afraid
i
intruding
on
your
owing
to
your
maid
misunderstanding
my
business
but
being
i
excuse
me
stating
what
i
come
for
oh
certainly
certainly
said
miss
ford
who
was
staring
vaguely
into
the
fireplace
a
rather
fascinating
thread
of
lilac
smoke
was
spinning
itself
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
little
white
paper
packet
the
names
of
the
mayor
of
the
brown
borough
miss
meter
mostyn
ford
and
lady
a
all
of
i
understand
from
the
maid
are
present
been
mentioned
as
being
presoomably
willing
to
give
information
likely
to
be
in
the
search
for
a
suspicious
cherecter
is
believed
to
intruded
on
a
cheritable
meeting
at
which
you
were
present
last
seturday
in
order
to
escape
arrest
just
perpetrated
a
petty
theft
from
a
baker
schwab
the
cherecter
is
charged
now
with
a
more
important
offence
being
in
possession
of
an
armed
flying
machine
in
defiance
of
the
defence
of
the
realm
act
and
interfering
with
the
work
of
majesty
forces
during
enemy
attack
the
cherecter
is
believed
to
be
a
man
in
female
disguise
but
enquiry
up
to
date
failed
to
get
any
useful
description
you
ladies
and
gents
i
understand
should
be
able
to
the
law
in
this
metter
there
was
a
stunned
silence
in
the
room
broken
only
by
the
pastoral
sound
of
the
witch
eating
grassy
sandwiches
after
a
moment
miss
ford
the
mayor
and
lady
arabel
all
began
speaking
at
once
and
each
stopped
with
a
look
of
relief
on
hearing
that
some
one
else
was
ready
to
take
the
responsibility
of
speaking
then
the
witch
began
with
her
mouth
full
you
know
but
lady
arabel
interrupted
her
angela
dear
be
silent
this
does
not
concern
you
of
course
inspector
we
all
only
too
dretfully
anxious
to
do
anything
to
help
the
law
but
you
must
specify
the
occasion
more
exactly
our
committee
sees
so
many
applicants
you
are
lady
a
i
believe
said
the
policeman
impassively
well
my
lady
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
are
aware
thet
the
cherecter
in
question
was
seen
to
leave
your
last
night
at
nine
after
the
warning
of
approaching
enemy
atteck
was
given
and
to
disappear
in
an
easterly
direction
on
a
miniature
than
air
machine
make
and
number
unknown
the
threads
of
curious
smoke
in
the
fireplace
were
increasing
they
shivered
as
though
with
laughter
and
flowed
like
crimped
hair
up
the
chimney
i
had
a
last
night
certainly
stammered
lady
arabel
a
trembling
seized
the
sock
she
was
knitting
she
had
turned
the
heel
some
time
ago
but
in
the
present
stress
had
forgotten
all
about
the
toe
the
prolonged
sock
grew
every
minute
more
and
more
like
a
with
a
bend
in
it
why
yes
of
course
i
had
a
why
should
i
my
son
rrchud
a
private
in
the
london
rifles
this
young
lady
miss
angela
er
and
her
friend
such
a
good
quiet
creature
and
else
was
in
the
asked
the
policeman
glancing
haughtily
at
the
witch
oh
nobody
nobody
the
servants
all
gave
notice
and
left
too
dretfully
tahsome
how
they
ca
stand
rrchud
and
his
ways
of
course
there
was
the
orchestra
pieces
but
dependable
dependable
said
the
witch
is
a
mystery
word
to
me
i
ca
think
how
it
got
into
the
english
language
without
being
right
surely
your
son
peculiar

very
slowly
that

have
been
having
since
last
saturday
the
policeman
fixed

ominous
gaze
upon
her
for
quite
a
minute
before

wrote
something

his
notebook
is
private
richard
in
town
he
asked
of
lady
arabel
in
a
casual
voice
i
suppose

she
replied
but
he
has
such
a
dretful
habit
of
disappearing
the
policeman
turned
to
the
mayor

said

a
coin
here
harold
called
the
witch
and
holding
harold
collar
she
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
mounted
and
flew
away
she
left
a
room
full
of
noise
behind
her
the
policeman
who
was
intoxicated
with
the
strange
fumes
said
hell
hell

lady
arabel
called

vain

angela

so
dretfully
rash
tovey
now
afflicted
with
a
lock

the
policeman
by
the
shoulder
thinking
to
prevent
him
from
jumping
out
of
the
window

shouted
the
mayor
slapped
his
thigh
with
a
loud
report

yelled

miss
macbee
laughed
hysterically
and
very
loudly

word

cautiously
several
times
and
rubbed
the
bridge
of
his
nose
he
rather
thought
everybody
was
pulling
his
leg
but
could
not
be
sure
only
miss
ford
sat
silent
chapter
ix
the
house
of
living
alone
moves
away
when
sarah
brown
and
richard
followed
by
the
dog
david
reached
the
mitten
island
ferry
after
travelling
slowly
by
moonlight
they
were
surprised
to
see
a
great
crowd
of
people
banked
up
on
the
island
and
one
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
policeman
standing
alone
on
the
mainland
about
ten
yards
from
land
the
ferryman
sat
in
his
boat
rowing
gently
to
keep
himself
stationary
in
the
current
you
to
come
to
shore
now
said
the
policeman
in
the
tone
of
one
exhausted
by
long
argument
some
more
parties
wanting
to
cross
he
turned
to
richard
look
mate
he
said
i
in
the
discharge
of
my
dooty
and
this
ferryman
is
obstructin
me
deah
deah
said
richard
the
ferryman
said
if
the
king
of
england
why
if
the
two
ghosts
of
queen
victoria
and
albert
the
good
was
waiting
to
cross
now
i
would
come
in
for
them
not
if
it
was
going
to
give
you
a
chance
to
set
foot
on
mitten
island
the
crowd
across
the
river
divining
that
a
climax
of
defiance
was
being
reached
shouted
yah
yah
in
unison
is
either
of
you
parties
an
on
mitten
island
asked
the
policeman
of
sarah
brown
and
richard
i
am
said
richard
to
his
companion
surprise
can
you
give
me
any
information
regarding
the
whereabouts
of
a
cherecter
known
under
any
of
these
names
iris
watkins
hangela
the
witch
possibly
a
male
in
female
disguise
believed
to
conduct
a
general
shop
and
boardin
on
mitten
island
there
is
only
one
shop
on
mitten
island
said
richard
and
one
boarding
house
all
in
one
i
own
it
i
can
recite
you
the
prospectus
if
you
like
i
have
a
superintendent
there
i
have
known
her
all
my
life
i
did
not
know
she
was
believed
to
be
a
male
in
female
disguise
i
did
not
know
she
had
any
name
at
all
let
alone
the
policeman
seemed
to
be
troubled
all
the
time
by
mosquitoes
he
slapped
his
face
and
his
ears
and
the
back
of
his
neck
he
succeeded
in
killing
one
insect
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
left
it
there
by
mistake
a
strangely
ignoble
corpse
sarah
brown
suspected
richard
of
some
responsibility
for
this
untimely
persecution
that
party
is
charged
with
an
offence
against
the
defence
of
the
realm
act
said
the
policeman
with
being
although
a
civilian
in
possession
of
a
flying
machine
and
er
obstructin
enemies
in
the
performance
of
their
dooty
oh
deah
deah
said
richard
deah
deah
deah
do
either
of
you
know
the
present
whereabouts
of
the
party
persisted
the
policeman
attacked
on
every
side
by
insects
he
was
becoming
rather
pathetic
in
his
discomfort
and
indignity
his
small
eyes
set
in
red
fat
stared
with
uncomprehending
protest
his
fat
busy
hands
were
not
agile
enough
to
defend
him
he
felt
unsuccessful
and
foolish
and
very
near
the
ground
he
wished
quite
disproportionately
to
be
at
home
with
his
admiring
wife
in
acton
sarah
brown
shook
her
head
in
reply
and
richard
could
say
nothing
but
oh
deah
deah
may
i
take
your
name
and
address
and
regimental
number
please
young
man
said
the
policeman
after
a
baffled
pause
now
my
address
said
richard
with
genuine
shame
is
a
thing
i
honestly
can
never
remember
i
know
i
heard
it
i
tried
and
tried
to
learn
it
at
my
mother
knee
it
begins
with
an
h
i
think
the
worst
of
not
being
able
to
read
or
write
i
can
describe
the
place
to
you
exactly
a
house
with
a
lot
of
windows
that
sees
a
long
way
if
you
turn
your
back
on
the
marble
arch
and
go
on
till
you
get
to
a
big
poster
saying
eat
less
meat
and
then
turn
to
your
right
pointing
to
the
left
or
again
if
you
go
by
air
as
the
crow
flies
or
rather
as
the
witch
flies
you
shall
of
this
foolery
my
fine
feller
said
the
distressed
policeman
almost
with
a
break
in
his
voice
seein
as
you
refuse
information
an
this
ferryman
thinks
fit
to
defy
the
law
i
no
course
open
but
to
whistle
for
my
mate
and
leave
while
i
telephone
for
a
he
raised
his
whistle
to
his
lips
but
before
he
could
blow
it
the
climax
of
this
the
least
successful
evening
of
his
life
overwhelmed
him
a
shadow
swept
over
the
party
a
large
flying
substance
caught
him
full
on
the
back
of
the
neck
and
knocked
him
off
the
into
the
river
the
witch
on
harold
her
broomstick
landed
on
the
spot
vacated
by
the
policeman
oh
look
what
i
done
look
what
i
done
she
exclaimed
in
an
ecstasy
of
vexation
there
was
no
need
to
tell
anybody
to
look
five
hundred
odd
people
were
already
doing
so
with
enthusiasm
oh
what
a
dreadfully
bad
landing
oh
harold
how
could
you
be
so
careless
she
took
the
cringing
harold
by
the
mane
and
slapped
him
violently
once
or
twice
richard
stretched
out
his
to
the
splashing
policeman
murmuring
oh
deah
deah
do
be
frightened
said
the
witch
to
the
policeman
we
soon
get
you
out
and
the
water
so
shallow
you
ca
sink
talking
of
sinking
richard
there
a
question
that
puzzles
me
rather
if
a
rat
got
on
to
a
submarine
how
would
it
behave
a
submarine
you
see
is
a
sinking
ship
and
rats
pride
themselves
so
on
knowing
when
to
sarah
brown
seized
the
witch
by
the
shoulder
go
away
witch
she
said
how
mean
go
away
asked
the
witch
i
only
just
this
minute
come
go
away
go
away
was
all
that
sarah
brown
could
manage
to
repeat
oh
very
well
said
the
witch
in
her
offended
voice
i
can
take
a
hint
i
suppose
as
well
as
anybody
i
going
she
seated
herself
with
an
irritable
flouncing
movement
on
saddle
and
flew
away
the
policeman
climbed
out
of
the
water
looking
like
an
enraged
seal
peals
of
laughter
from
the
other
side
of
the
moonlit
river
robbed
him
of
adequate
words
not
ser
fast
my
fine
feller
he
roared
seeing
richard
kissing
the
horse
vivian
on
the
nose
preparatory
to
riding
away
do
you
think
for
a
minute
i
do
know
at
the
bottom
of
this
you
do
know
how
tired
i
am
of
loud
noises
said
richard
lifting
one
foot
with
dignity
to
the
stirrup
you
do
know
how
bitterly
i
long
to
be
still
and
hear
things
very
far
off
but
always
there
is
an
angry
voice
or
the
angry
noise
of
guns
in
the
way
he
twined
one
finger
negligently
into
the
mane
on
the
horse
neck
and
pulled
himself
slowly
into
the
saddle
the
policeman
stood
mysteriously
impotent
water
dripped
loudly
from
his
clothes
and
punctuated
richard
quiet
speech
dear
policeman
continued
richard
i
believe
you
have
talked
so
much
that
you
have
heard
what
a
quiet
night
it
is
you
are
smaller
than
a
star
and
yet
you
make
more
noise
than
all
the
stars
together
you
are
not
so
cold
as
the
moon
and
yet
your
teeth
chatter
more
loudly
than
hers
the
heat
of
your
wrath
is
less
than
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
yet
while
he
is
silent
and
departed
you
fill
the
air
with
clamour
and
if
i
may
say
so
seem
to
be
outstaying
your
welcome
oh
dear
policeman
listen
do
you
know
if
there
were
no
london
on
this
side
and
no
war
on
that
the
silence
would
be
deep
enough
to
fill
all
the
seas
of
all
the
worlds
he
shook
the
reins
and
the
horse
vivian
moved
treading
quietly
on
the
strip
of
grass
that
borders
the
path
to
the
ferry
i
am
going
to
talk
to
my
true
love
now
said
richard
his
voice
fading
away
as
he
rode
my
true
love
voice
is
the
only
voice
that
is
a
little
more
beautiful
to
me
than
silence
for
a
moment
he
looked
every
inch
a
wizard
every
button
on
his
uniform
and
every
buckle
on
the
horse
vivian
harness
caught
the
moonlight
and
changed
into
faery
spangles
as
he
turned
and
waved
his
hand
before
disappearing
the
policeman
seemed
quieted
as
he
looked
at
sarah
brown
sitting
white
and
haggard
with
pain
on
the
river
bank
with
her
arm
round
the
shivering
david
in
a
minute
in
a
minute
my
one
she
was
saying
to
david
we
are
nearly
home
now
we
shall
soon
be
quiet
now
there
was
always
something
startlingly
inoffensive
about
sarah
appearance
i
like
to
know
was
responsible
for
this
houtrage
all
the
same
said
the
policeman
sarah
brown
did
not
hear
him
but
she
said
oh
i
am
so
very
sorry
it
happened
it
was
a
pure
accident
of
course
but
it
is
so
terrible
to
see
any
one
have
an
accident
to
his
dignity
you
must
forget
it
quickly
you
must
run
and
find
someone
who
knows
you
at
your
best
you
must
tell
her
a
fine
revised
version
of
the
incident
and
then
you
will
feel
better
the
ferryman
shouted
i
do
mind
coming
in
now
to
fetch
this
young
woman
you
can
come
too
now
if
you
like
for
the
party
you
looking
for
is
not
at
home
and
i
no
doubt
but
what
that
crowd
over
there
will
give
you
a
gay
welcome
i
look
into
the
metter
said
the
policeman
you
the
last
of
this
none
of
you
not
by
a
long
chalk
i
a
good
mind
to
get
the
mayor
to
read
the
riot
act
at
you
as
sarah
brown
landed
on
mitten
island
she
could
not
distinguish
the
faces
of
the
waiting
crowd
but
she
heard
sharp
anxious
voices
they
ai
goin
to
get
not
if
i
knows
it
she
never
speaks
but
kindness
the
dear
lamb
she
more
of
a
saint
than
any
in
the
calendar
she
gave
my
danny
a
room
in
house
and
put
into
after
lost
sight
in
the
war
she
the
good
fairy
of
the
island
she
grew
all
them
sweet
williams
in
my
garden
in
one
night
when
i
first
come
and
was
for
devon
the
law
always
after
saints
and
fairies
always
bin
but
the
law
ca
catch
the
law
has
driven
her
away
said
sarah
brown
there
is
no
magic
now
on
mitten
island
she
staggered
through
the
open
door
of
the
shop
this
is
house
she
said
to
herself
as
she
entered
and
felt
doubly
alone
because
richard
was
far
away
riding
to
his
true
love
she
struck
her
last
match
lit
the
lantern
and
looked
round
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
of
living
alone
she
thought
there
would
never
again
be
any
magic
sound
there
to
penetrate
to
her
imprisoned
hearing
the
aprons
hanging
from
the
ceiling
near
the
door
flapped
in
the
cold
wind
and
she
thought
they
were
like
grey
bats
in
a
cave
the
breeze
blew
out
the
open
lantern
ah
how
desolate
how
desolate
a
piece
of
paper
was
impaled
upon
the
counter
by
means
of
a
headless
hatpin
there
was
something
very
largely
and
badly
written
on
it
sarah
brown
read
well
soup
it
looks
like
my
night
come
and
what
dyou
think
sherry
come
too
im
an
me
as
gone
off
to
a
place
e
knows
that
a
fine
place
for
such
a
boy
as
elbert
to
be
born
in
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
true
peony
sarah
brown
climbed
up
the
short
stairway
painful
step
by
painful
step
to
her
cell
she
sat
on
her
bed
holding
her
throbbing
side
and
breathing
with
fearful
caution
she
looked
at
the
empty
grate
she
put
a
cigarette
in
her
mouth
the
unconscious
and
futile
answer
of
the
dweller
alone
to
that
blind
hunger
for
comfort
but
she
had
no
matches
and
presently
dimly
conscious
that
her
groping
for
comfort
had
lacked
result
she
absently
put
another
cigarette
into
her
mouth
and
then
felt
a
fool
she
stared
at
the
cold
window
the
sky
seemed
to
be
nailed
carelessly
to
it
by
means
of
a
crooked
star
or
two
these
are
the
terrible
nights
of
living
alone
when
you
have
fever
and
sometimes
think
that
your
beloved
stands
in
the
doorway
to
bring
you
comfort
and
sometimes
think
that
you
have
no
beloved
and
that
there
is
no
one
left
in
all
the
world
no
word
no
warmth
nor
ever
a
kindly
candle
to
be
lighted
in
that
spotted
darkness
that
walls
up
your
hot
sight
again
on
those
nights
you
dream
that
you
have
already
done
those
genial
things
your
body
cries
for
or
perhaps
that
other
has
done
them
the
fire
is
built
and
alight
at
last
a
cup
of
something
cool
and
beautifully
sour
stands
ready
to
your
hand
you
can
hear
the
delicious
rattle
of
china
on
a
tray
in
the
passage
someone
coming
with
food
you
would
love
to
look
at
and
presently
perhaps
to
eat
when
you
feel
better
but
again
and
again
your
eyes
open
on
the
cold
dumb
darkness
and
there
is
nothing
but
the
wind
and
strange
sinister
emptiness
creaking
on
the
stair
these
are
the
terrible
nights
of
living
alone
yet
no
real
lover
of
that
house
and
of
that
state
would
ever
exchange
one
of
those
haunted
and
desert
nights
for
a
night
spent
watched
in
soft
warm
places
sarah
brown
was
not
long
left
alone
that
night
to
look
at
the
strip
of
moonlight
on
the
cold
ashes
of
her
fireplace
the
shop
below
shook
suddenly
with
many
footfalls
and
the
metallic
officious
barking
of
the
dog
david
rent
the
still
air
of
her
cell
a
man
voice
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
said
i
can
hear
a
dog
barking
and
a
woman
voice
followed
it
angela
dear
is
that
you
sarah
brown
was
only
aware
of
a
vague
and
irksome
disturbance
she
groped
to
her
door
opened
it
and
shouted
miserably
go
away
policeman
go
away
she
is
not
here
lady
arabel
came
up
flashing
an
electric
torch
my
dear
you
look
dretfully
why
look
you
are
trembling
why
look
your
little
dog
is
making
your
counterpane
muddy
do
be
afraid
for
angela
we
are
all
here
to
try
and
help
her
all
here
yes
meta
and
the
mayor
and
tovey
and
frere
let
me
help
you
into
bed
and
then
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
know
of
her
you
have
had
a
dretfully
trying
time
i
am
well
said
sarah
brown
ungraciously
you
are
none
of
you
going
to
help
the
witch
without
me
ah
this
is
all
very
dretful
sighed
lady
arabel
most
foolish
of
us
to
come
here
all
together
like
this
after
the
policeman
took
our
names
and
addresses
and
was
dretfully
impertinent
and
suspicious
but
meta
insisted
i
quite
expect
to
spend
the
next
hours
in
gaol
or
else
to
be
shot
for
offence
of
the
realm
in
fact
speaking
as
a
ratepayer
i
think
the
police
ought
to
have
done
it
before
still
meta
thought
we
might
perhaps
be
able
to
help
angela
meta
has
many
friends
who
seem
influential
but
talkative
my
dear
she
led
the
way
downstairs
tovey
and
the
mayor
were
talking
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
frere
was
listening
sardonically
as
sarah
brown
went
past
them
into
the
shop
she
smelt
the
scent
that
always
denoted
the
presence
of
miss
ford
sarah
brown
herself
was
accompanied
by
nothing
more
seductive
than
a
faint
smell
of
gasoline
showing
that
her
clothes
had
lately
been
in
the
darkness
of
the
shop
she
saw
miss
ford
stooping
trying
to
shut
the
big
difficult
drawer
in
which
the
witch
kept
her
magic
it
is
frightfully
explosive
said
sarah
brown
miss
ford
started
and
straightened
her
back
ah
miss
brown
i
was
just
looking
about
sarah
brown
sat
gasping
on
the
counter
and
the
rest
of
the
party
the
shop
bringing
the
lantern
how
very
absurd
all
this
is
said
miss
ford
nervously
taking
such
a
great
deal
of
trouble
about
a
necessitous
case
america
is
in
my
mind
said
lady
arabel
if
we
could
get
her
there
anybody
who
has
done
anything
silly
goes
to
america
indeed
if
i
remember
rightly
america
is
entirely
populated
with
fugitives
from
somewhere
else
so
dretfully
confusing
for
the
red
indians
they
say
the
story
of
the
tower
of
babel
was
only
a
prophecy
about
the
woolworth
building
you
could
get
a
passport
said
darnby
frere
who
was
the
only
person
present
really
conscious
of
sanity
only
a
miracle
could
produce
a
passport
in
these
days
especially
for
a
fugitive
from
justice
only
a
miracle
or
magic
said
sarah
brown
miss
ford
moved
instinctively
behind
the
counter
towards
the
open
drawer
full
of
ingredients
for
happiness
we
must
remember
added
frere
that
after
all
she
did
break
the
law
in
fact
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
why
on
earth
we
are
all
oh
darnby
do
be
sensible
said
miss
ford
of
course
we
know
it
is
wrong
to
break
the
law
but
in
this
case
well
i
myself
should
be
the
last
to
blame
her
no
not
the
last
said
sarah
brown
what
do
you
mean
certainly
not
the
last
probably
not
even
the
penultimate
one
you
flatter
yourself
why
surely
some
of
you
ladies
movin
in
the
circles
knows
of
gentlemen
in
the
foreign
office
that
would
do
a
little
job
for
old
times
sake
suggested
the
mayor
this
was
a
challenge
to
miss
ford
she
ceased
to
gaze
haughtily
on
sarah
brown
men
from
three
departments
of
the
foreign
office
are
fairly
regular
wednesday
friends
of
mine
she
said
but
i
could
hardly
trouble
any
of
them
on
er
so
trivial
a
matter
there
was
silence
while
miss
ford
toyed
gingerly
with
one
of
the
paper
packets
out
of
the
witch
drawer
presently
she
said
what
about
richard
lady
arabel
showed
sudden
irritation
there
you
go
again
meta
i
have
spoken
to
you
of
it
again
and
again
it
rrchud
this
and
rrchud
that
whenever
anything
in
the
least
tahsome
or
out
of
the
way
happens
one
would
think
you
considered
the
poor
boy
a
wizard
you
need
lose
your
temper
arabel
said
miss
ford
coldly
i
only
meant
that
richard
might
be
useful
having
so
many
friends
and
such
skill
in
chemistry
as
if
unconsciously
she
tore
off
one
corner
of
the
packet
of
magic
she
held
before
adding
and
besides
as
i
have
often
told
you
i
believe
richard
to
have
real
occult
power
which
would
give
him
a
special
interest
in
this
case
sarah
brown
who
was
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
and
missing
much
of
the
conversation
caught
the
name
of
richard
and
said
richard
has
gone
to
his
true
love
a
tempest
of
restrained
embarrassment
arose
she
feverish
murmured
miss
ford
turning
scarlet
my
dear
sarah
said
lady
arabel
tartly
you
are
quite
mistaken
and
i
must
beg
of
you
to
be
careful
how
you
repeat
idle
gossip
about
my
son
rrchud
is
at
his
office
you
know
it
is
only
open
at
night
one
of
rrchud
quaint
fancies
i
will
ring
up
his
office
said
miss
ford
deciding
to
ignore
sarah
brown
both
now
and
in
future
where
is
the
telephone
there
is
none
replied
sarah
brown
this
is
the
house
of
living
alone
miss
ford
was
pouring
a
grain
or
two
of
the
magic
into
her
palm
how
very
credulous
people
are
she
said
with
a
smile
if
thelma
bennett
watkins
were
here
she
would
credit
this
powder
with
she
stopped
for
an
astonishing
sharp
smell
filled
the
shop
almost
immediately
a
curious
wheezy
sound
punctuated
by
taps
proceeded
from
the
corner
it
was
bernard
tovey
trying
to
sing
mon
coeur
à
ta
voix
and
beating
time
by
swinging
his
heels
against
the
counter
on
which
he
sat
sarah
brown
felt
suddenly
well
she
trembled
but
was
well
she
jumped
off
the
counter
i
will
run
across
if
you
like
she
said
and
ring
up
richard
from
the
ferryman
house
he
may
have
left
his
true
love
now
i
am
not
deaf
on
the
telephone
and
the
ferryman
wo
admit
strangers
as
she
left
the
smell
of
magic
was
getting
stronger
and
stronger
tovey
still
impersonating
delilah
in
the
corner
was
approaching
the
more
excitable
passages
of
the
song
miss
ford
was
saying
really
bernard
sarah
brown
felt
a
slight
misgiving
a
warm
and
rather
light
was
shining
behind
the
red
curtain
of
the
ferryman
lattice
window
as
sarah
brown
crossed
the
moonlit
road
she
delighted
after
her
recent
black
hours
to
think
of
all
those
people
in
the
world
who
were
sitting
stuffily
and
pleasantly
in
little
ugly
rooms
that
they
loved
doing
quiet
careful
things
that
pleased
them
and
she
told
herself
that
the
thought
of
richard
little
office
alone
and
alight
in
the
deserted
city
every
night
would
comfort
her
often
in
the
darkness
the
ferryman
opened
his
door
and
invited
her
genially
to
his
telephone
he
had
been
sitting
at
his
table
surrounded
by
the
snakes
that
for
him
took
the
place
of
a
family
on
the
table
was
a
bowl
of
milk
from
which
a
large
in
a
gay
design
was
drinking
a
yellow
and
black
python
lay
coiled
in
several
figures
of
eight
in
the
armchair
and
an
small
snake
with
a
broad
nose
and
an
active
tongue
leaned
out
of
the
ferryman
breast
pocket
are
they
beautiful
he
said
with
shy
and
paternal
pride
as
sarah
brown
tried
to
find
a
place
on
which
the
python
would
like
to
be
tickled
or
scratched
somehow
the
python
has
a
barren
figure
from
a
point
of
view
the
ferryman
went
on
there
is
something
about
the
grip
and
spring
in
a
snake
body
that
makes
me
feel
giddy
with
pleasure
snakes
to
me
you
know
are
just
a
drug
sold
by
the
yard
instead
of
in
bottles
my
brain
is
getting
every
day
colder
and
quieter
and
all
through
loving
snakes
so
sarah
brown
rang
up
richard
office
and
the
voice
of
a
young
gentleman
clerk
answered
her
higgins
was
not
in
the
office
higgins
had
left
particular
word
that
if
any
one
wanted
him
they
were
to
be
told
that
he
had
er
gone
to
his
true
love
but
any
minor
business
matter
connected
with
magic
could
be
attended
to
in
his
absence
higgins
spending
so
much
of
his
time
on
the
battlefield
at
present
a
good
deal
of
the
routine
work
had
to
be
done
in
any
case
by
the
speaker
his
confidential
clerk
passports
to
america
perfectly
simple
the
office
had
simply
to
issue
blank
sheets
treated
in
a
certain
way
and
every
official
to
whom
the
sheet
should
be
presented
would
read
upon
it
what
he
would
want
but
higgins
would
have
to
affix
his
mark
and
seal
higgins
would
be
in
the
office
sometime
probably
within
the
hour
how
many
passports
two
said
sarah
brown
one
for
my
friend
and
one
for
me
a
dog
does
need
one
does
he
a
british
dog
i
will
book
the
berths
i
can
pawn
my
or
rather
i
can
sell
my
war
loan
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
the
ferryman
asked
are
you
having
a
party
up
at
the
shop
in
the
superintendent
absence
not
intentionally
replied
sarah
brown
why
well
i
just
wondered
there
a
noise
like
a
thousand
mad
gramophones
playing
backwards
coming
from
there
sarah
brown
misgivings
returned
like
a
clap
of
thunder
she
rushed
back
to
the
shop
the
lantern
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
its
glass
was
shattered
and
out
of
each
of
its
eight
panels
streamed
a
great
flame
six
or
seven
feet
high
like
the
petal
of
an
enormous
flower
facing
these
flames
stood
miss
ford
and
tovey
hand
in
hand
each
singing
a
different
song
very
earnestly
lady
arabel
had
found
somewhere
a
patent
fire
extinguisher
and
was
putting
on
her
glasses
in
order
to
read
the
directions
frere
was
hesitating
in
the
background
with
a
leaking
biscuit
tin
full
of
water
the
mayor
was
gone
great
scott
said
sarah
brown
you
burn
the
place
down
look
at
that
row
of
petticoats
up
there
catching
fire
already
what
have
you
done
with
the
mayor
we
made
him
invisible
by
mistake
whispered
tovey
but
sh
sh
he
does
know
it
yet
nothing
matters
said
miss
ford
we
are
all
going
to
america
and
she
continued
her
song
which
was
an
extempore
one
about
the
sea
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
burn
the
house
down
said
sarah
brown
that
what
i
thought
agreed
frere
but
water
wo
put
out
that
flame
the
singers
fell
silent
only
the
voice
of
the
invisible
mayor
could
be
heard
singing
if
those
lips
could
only
speak
in
a
loud
tremulous
voice
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
own
unseen
stamping
feet
you
been
putting
magic
into
that
flame
said
sarah
brown
distractedly
i
told
you
it
was
dangerous
nothing
will
put
magic
out
except
more
magic
what
will
the
witch
say
it
does
matter
what
anybody
says
said
miss
ford
we
are
all
going
to
america
no
place
and
no
person
matters
when
i
am
not
there
there
are
no
places
and
no
people
existing
where
i
am
not
i
have
suspected
it
before
and
now
i
am
sure
that
everything
is
all
a
pretence
except
me
look
how
easy
it
was
to
dismiss
that
gross
grocer
from
sight
he
was
just
a
bit
of
background
i
have
painted
him
out
the
drapery
department
on
the
ceiling
was
ablaze
now
and
flakes
of
ashy
petticoat
and
the
metal
frames
of
buttons
showered
to
the
floor
i
will
go
and
get
help
said
sarah
brown
and
hurried
out
of
doors
followed
feverishly
by
david
who
was
not
a
very
brave
dog
in
moments
of
crisis
and
yet
liked
to
appear
busy
and
helpful
it
was
to
the
ferryman
telephone
that
they
returned
sarah
brown
knew
that
the
fire
was
a
magic
fire
and
that
an
appeal
to
the
fire
brigade
would
only
bring
defeat
and
unnecessary
bewilderment
upon
a
deserving
organisation
sarah
brown
rang
up
richard
office
and
richard
who
had
a
heroic
and
almost
cinematic
gift
for
being
on
hand
at
the
right
moments
answered
her
himself
come
at
once
said
sarah
brown
the
house
of
living
alone
is
on
fire
someone
has
been
tampering
with
the
magic
drawer
oh
deah
deah
said
richard
and
this
is
such
a
busy
night
at
the
office
too
do
you
think
it
is
really
important
it
is
my
house
you
know
well
i
do
see
what
is
to
prevent
mitten
island
from
being
burnt
to
the
water
edge
in
fact
i
do
see
why
being
a
magic
fire
it
should
stop
at
the
water
edge
not
to
mention
that
the
mayor
very
well
i
come
said
richard
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
door
he
arrived
i
came
by
flash
of
lightning
he
explained
smoothing
his
hair
and
readjusting
his
bill
sykes
service
cap
in
the
manner
of
one
who
has
moved
swiftly
the
lightning
service
is
getting
very
bad
i
was
held
up
for
quite
of
a
second
over
whitehall
there
was
some
wireless
coming
in
and
the
lightning
had
to
let
it
pass
now
what
all
this
fuss
about
sarah
brown
there
was
a
crowd
of
delirious
mitten
islanders
round
the
house
of
living
alone
while
sarah
brown
and
richard
were
about
fifty
yards
away
a
and
enormous
white
flame
suddenly
wrapped
the
house
about
like
a
hand
clutching
and
crushing
it
the
faggots
round
the
stake
are
lighted
said
richard
but
the
witch
has
fled
it
seemed
that
the
stars
were
devoured
by
the
flame
so
far
did
it
outshine
them
the
flame
shrank
in
upon
itself
and
collapsed
there
was
no
more
house
of
living
alone
oh
richard
said
sarah
brown
your
mother
and
miss
ford
and
was
mother
in
there
asked
richard
placidly
wonders
will
never
cease
well
well
it
is
fortunate
that
no
magic
of
any
sort
could
ever
touch
mother
and
indeed
as
they
pushed
through
the
crowd
they
saw
all
the
recent
occupants
of
the
shop
arguing
at
the
front
gate
i
did
blow
it
tovey
was
saying
in
an
aggrieved
voice
i
was
singing
not
blowing
well
all
i
know
is
that
while
you
were
on
that
high
note
something
seemed
to
scatter
the
flames
and
the
drawer
full
of
explosives
caught
fire
said
darnby
frere
aggressively
flourishing
his
empty
biscuit
tin
it
does
matter
said
miss
ford
calmly
we
are
all
going
across
the
sea
she
roused
herself
a
little
and
said
to
frere
with
a
smile
you
know
i
inherit
the
sea
tradition
my
father
commanded
in
i
wonder
what
put
out
the
flame
so
suddenly
asked
tovey
who
was
still
dreamily
beating
time
to
imaginary
music
with
one
hand
i
put
it
out
said
richard
i
wonder
whose
house
it
is
added
tovey
turning
vaguely
to
face
richard
it
is
my
house
said
richard
they
all
discovered
his
presence
your
house
dear
rrchud
exclaimed
lady
arabel
are
you
sure
i
did
know
the
higginses
had
any
house
property
on
mitten
island
they
have
now
replied
richard
but
never
mind
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
there
were
too
many
houses
in
the
world
most
houses
are
traps
into
which
everything
enters
and
out
of
which
nothing
comes
it
always
grieves
me
to
see
tradesmen
pouring
sustenance
in
at
the
back
door
and
no
result
or
justification
coming
out
of
the
front
door
i
often
think
that
only
the
houses
that
men
bodies
have
deserted
are
really
inhabited
it
was
i
who
burnt
your
house
down
richard
said
miss
ford
but
it
does
matter
it
was
a
real
house
you
are
right
said
richard
to
such
as
you
dear
meta
it
was
not
a
real
house
it
was
the
house
of
living
alone
and
only
to
people
who
live
alone
was
it
real
it
is
dark
and
deserted
now
and
levelled
with
the
cold
ground
it
is
as
though
it
were
a
tent
being
moved
from
its
position
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
those
dwellers
alone
who
wander
continually
in
silence
up
and
down
the
world
he
looked
at
sarah
brown
talking
of
wandering
said
miss
ford
we
are
all
going
to
america
richard
can
you
get
us
passports
certainly
agreed
richard
to
america
eh
a
nice
little
trip
for
you
all
america
you
know
would
be
entirely
magic
if
it
were
for
the
americans
i
have
quite
a
circle
of
friends
in
new
york
said
miss
ford
who
seemed
to
be
recovering
from
her
beware
said
richard
lest
you
all
forget
the
magic
of
and
change
from
adventurers
to
tourists
i
am
not
going
to
america
said
lady
arabel
i
am
going
home
i
never
heard
such
dretful
nonsense
i
was
only
in
fun
when
i
agreed
to
the
plan
i
never
agreed
to
the
plan
at
all
said
frere
i
shall
be
truly
thankful
to
get
to
bed
and
wake
up
sober
i
will
never
go
out
to
tea
in
kensington
again
if
this
is
the
result
i
am
going
to
america
said
tovey
fixing
his
innocent
eyes
obscured
by
hair
upon
miss
ford
i
am
going
to
america
echoed
the
unseen
mayor
from
an
unexpected
direction
nobody
had
yet
dared
to
tell
him
of
the
misfortune
that
had
overtaken
him
i
give
up
this
mayor
job
catch
me
if
oh
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
i
did
need
reminding
interrupted
sarah
brown
it
seems
to
me
that
everybody
has
forgotten
why
they
came
here
please
richard
do
you
know
of
a
spell
to
find
a
missing
person
yes
several
answered
richard
who
was
always
as
eager
as
a
travelling
salesman
to
recommend
his
wares
there
is
an
awfully
ingenious
little
spell
i
can
show
you
if
you
happen
to
have
a
telephone
book
and
a
compass
and
a
toad
heart
and
a
hair
from
a
black
goat
beard
about
you
or
again
if
you
stand
on
a
at
low
tide
on
christmas
night
with
the
moon
at
your
back
and
a
wax
candle
in
your
left
hand
and
write
upon
the
sand
the
name
by
the
way
who
is
it
you
want
to
find
the
witch
answered
sarah
brown
richard
face
fell
oh
only
the
witch
he
said
i
can
tell
you
where
she
is
without
any
spell
at
all
she
with
my
true
love
at
higgins
farm
helping
oh
by
the
way
mother
i
forgot
to
tell
you
you
are
a
grandmother
rrchud
said
lady
arabel
she
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
smooth
grass
slope
between
the
road
and
the
garden
hedge
ah
it
is
too
cruel
she
cried
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
it
is
too
cruel
is
this
my
son
i
meant
so
well
and
all
my
life
i
did
the
things
that
other
people
did
the
natural
things
except
just
once
and
for
that
once
i
am
so
cruelly
punished
i
am
given
a
son
who
is
no
son
to
me
who
says
only
things
i
must
understand
who
does
only
things
i
must
see
she
paused
and
taking
her
hands
from
her
face
looked
round
aghast
at
richard
who
was
sitting
beside
her
on
the
bank
stroking
her
arm
faery
she
added
in
a
terrified
whisper
and
then
broke
out
again
crying
ah
it
is
too
cruel
richard
continued
to
stroke
her
arm
without
comprehension
yes
mother
and
peony
my
true
love
insists
on
calling
him
elbert
he
said
mother
listen
elbert
your
faery
grandson
but
lady
arabel
still
sobbed
chapter
x
the
dweller
alone
well
sarah
brown
here
we
are
said
the
witch
her
byronic
hair
flying
as
she
sat
perilously
on
the
rail
of
the
deck
the
distant
flying
buttresses
of
new
york
were
supporting
a
shining
sky
and
north
and
east
lay
the
harbour
and
sea
and
many
ships
moving
with
the
glad
gait
of
after
perilous
voyaging
every
minute
upon
the
sea
is
a
magic
minute
but
the
voyage
of
the
witch
and
sarah
brown
had
been
unmarked
by
any
supernatural
activities
on
the
part
of
the
witch
she
had
been
more
or
less
extinguished
by
the
presence
of
five
hundred
americans
not
one
of
whom
had
ever
heard
the
word
magic
used
except
by
advertisers
in
connection
with
their
wares
miss
ford
had
been
left
behind
cured
for
ever
of
she
had
become
unexpectedly
engaged
to
bernard
tovey
while
looking
for
a
porter
on
lime
street
station
liverpool
and
had
returned
with
him
to
london
to
celebrate
the
event
by
means
of
a
the
mayor
also
had
failed
to
embark
indeed
the
unfortunate
man
had
not
been
heard
of
since
his
seizure
on
the
night
of
the
fire
and
i
believe
that
the
london
police
are
still
trying
to
arrest
him
as
a
german
spy
here
we
are
said
the
witch
to
sarah
brown
at
least
i
suppose
this
city
on
its
tiptoes
is
new
york
do
you
think
i
ought
to
call
the
attention
of
the
captain
to
that
largish
lady
on
our
left
who
seems
to
be
marooned
upon
a
rock
and
signalling
to
us
for
help
that
is
the
statue
of
liberty
said
three
neighbouring
americans
in
chorus
how
mean
liberty
asked
the
witch
the
three
americans
froze
her
with
three
glances
america
is
the
home
of
liberty
they
said
all
together
oh
yes
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
said
the
witch
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
every
country
is
the
home
of
liberty
such
a
pity
that
liberty
never
seems
to
begin
at
home
every
big
shop
in
london
you
know
is
labelled
patronised
by
royalty
yet
i
have
bought
haberdashery
by
the
hour
without
running
across
a
single
queen
i
suppose
if
you
did
have
this
big
label
sticking
up
in
your
harbour
you
americans
might
forget
that
america
is
the
home
of
liberty
i
know
quite
a
lot
about
america
from
a
grey
squirrel
who
rents
my
on
mitten
island
it
is
a
long
time
since
he
came
over
but
he
still
chitters
with
a
strong
new
england
accent
he
came
away
because
he
was
a
socialist
i
gather
america
is
too
full
of
liberty
to
leave
room
for
socialism
that
so
my
squirrel
says
there
are
only
two
parties
in
america
republicans
and
sinners
at
least
i
think
that
was
what
he
said
and
anybody
who
belongs
to
neither
of
these
parties
is
given
penal
servitude
for
life
so
i
understood
but
i
may
be
wrong
i
am
not
very
good
at
politics
anyway
my
squirrel
had
to
leave
the
home
of
liberty
and
come
to
england
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
what
he
thought
i
wish
i
were
there
too
sarah
brown
i
do
yet
know
why
you
brought
me
here
i
brought
you
here
to
escape
the
law
said
sarah
brown
how
mean
escape
the
law
did
you
know
that
all
magic
lives
and
thrives
on
the
wrath
of
the
law
have
you
forgotten
our
heroic
tradition
of
martyrdom
and
the
stake
is
the
world
tame
enough
already
what
do
you
want
magic
to
become
a
branch
of
the
civil
service
i
spent
all
i
had
in
bringing
you
here
said
sarah
brown
i
left
all
i
loved
to
bring
you
here
i
am
as
if
dead
in
england
now
nobody
there
will
ever
think
of
me
again
except
as
a
thing
that
has
been
heard
the
last
of
the
witch
looked
kindly
at
her
you
know
she
said
when
you
first
told
me
to
go
away
after
harold
made
that
bad
landing
on
a
policeman
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
a
sort
of
cinema
villainess
driving
me
away
from
my
house
and
heritage
at
first
i
thought
of
arguing
the
matter
but
then
i
remembered
that
villains
always
have
a
rotten
time
without
being
bullied
and
persecuted
by
the
rest
of
us
besides
solid
things
are
never
worth
fighting
over
so
i
have
been
patient
with
you
all
this
time
and
have
fallen
in
courteously
with
all
your
fiendish
plans
as
i
thought
and
now
i
am
glad
i
was
patient
for
i
see
you
meant
well
dear
sarah
brown
you
did
mean
well
how
sad
it
is
that
people
who
have
once
lived
in
the
house
of
living
alone
can
never
make
a
success
of
friendship
you
say
you
left
all
you
loved
what
business
have
you
with
love
thank
you
my
dear
for
meaning
so
well
and
for
these
fair
days
at
sea
but
i
must
stay
with
you
i
must
set
foot
on
this
land
i
can
smell
cleverness
and
even
from
here
i
must
go
back
to
my
little
spring
island
and
my
parish
of
faery
ah
witch
do
leave
me
do
leave
me
like
this
ill
and
bewildered
and
so
far
from
home
how
can
you
ever
be
far
from
home
you
a
dweller
in
the
greatest
home
of
all
did
you
think
you
had
destroyed
the
house
of
living
alone
did
you
think
you
could
escape
from
it
sarah
brown
said
nothing
she
watched
the
witch
call
harold
her
broomstick
to
her
and
adjust
the
saddle
and
tighten
the
strap
round
his
middle
she
watched
her
mount
and
embark
upon
the
sunny
air
the
three
americans
were
talking
politics
and
did
not
notice
anything
but
each
other
the
witch
alighted
for
a
moment
on
one
spike
of
the
crown
of
liberty
and
climbing
carefully
down
on
to
the
lady
parting
was
seen
by
sarah
brown
to
bend
down
till
her
head
hung
apoplectically
upside
down
and
gaze
long
and
curiously
into
that
impassive
bronze
eye
presently
she
remounted
harold
and
with
a
flippant
and
ambiguous
gesture
of
her
foot
launched
herself
eastward
she
disappeared
without
looking
back
the
dock
was
reached
sarah
brown
collected
david
her
dog
and
humphrey
her
hers
was
a
very
wieldy
family
an
official
asked
her
something
using
one
side
of
his
mouth
only
to
do
so
in
the
alarming
manner
of
american
officials
i
can
not
hear
you
said
sarah
brown
i
am
stone
deaf
and
she
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
the
greater
house
