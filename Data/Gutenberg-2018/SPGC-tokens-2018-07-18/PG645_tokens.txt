this

first
published
the
text
follows
that
of
the
definitive
edition
chapter
i
i
had
done
a
few
things
and
earned
a
few
had
perhaps
even
had
time
to
begin
to
think
i
was
finer
than
was
perceived
by
the
patronising
but
when
i
take
the
little
measure
of
my
course
a
fidgety
habit
for
it
s
none
of
the
longest
yet
i
count
my
real
start
from
the
evening
george
corvick
breathless
and
worried
came
in
to
ask
me
a
service
he
had
done
more
things
than
i
and
earned
more
pence
though
there
were
chances
for
cleverness
i
thought
he
sometimes
missed
i
could
only
however
that
evening
declare
to
him
that
he
never
missed
one
for
kindness
there
was
almost
rapture
in
hearing
it
proposed
to
me
to
prepare
for
the
organ
of
our
lucubrations
so
called
from
the
position
in
the
week
of
its
day
of
appearance
an
article
for
which
he
had
made
himself
responsible
and
of
which
tied
up
with
a
stout
string
he
laid
on
my
table
the
subject
i
pounced
upon
my
is
on
the
first
volume
of
paid
scant
attention
to
my
friend
s
explanation
of
his
appeal
what
explanation
could
be
more
to
the
point
than
my
obvious
fitness
for
the
task
i
had
written
on
hugh
vereker
but
never
a
word
in
where
my
dealings
were
mainly
with
the
ladies
and
the
minor
poets
this
was
his
new
novel
an
advance
copy
and
whatever
much
or
little
it
should
do
for
his
reputation
i
was
clear
on
the
spot
as
to
what
it
should
do
for
mine
moreover
if
i
always
read
him
as
soon
as
i
could
get
hold
of
him
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
read
him
now
i
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
bridges
for
the
following
sunday
and
it
had
been
mentioned
in
lady
jane
s
note
that
vereker
was
to
be
there
i
was
young
enough
for
a
flutter
at
meeting
a
man
of
his
renown
and
innocent
enough
to
believe
the
occasion
would
demand
the
display
of
an
acquaintance
with
his
corvick
who
had
promised
a
review
of
it
had
not
even
had
time
to
read
it
he
had
gone
to
pieces
in
consequence
of
news
on
precipitate
reflexion
he
he
should
catch
the
to
paris
he
had
had
a
telegram
from
gwendolen
erme
in
answer
to
his
letter
offering
to
fly
to
her
aid
i
knew
already
about
gwendolen
erme
i
had
never
seen
her
but
i
had
my
ideas
which
were
mainly
to
the
effect
that
corvick
would
marry
her
if
her
mother
would
only
die
that
lady
seemed
now
in
a
fair
way
to
oblige
him
after
some
dreadful
mistake
about
a
climate
or
a
cure
she
had
suddenly
collapsed
on
the
return
from
abroad
her
daughter
unsupported
and
alarmed
desiring
to
make
a
rush
for
home
but
hesitating
at
the
risk
had
accepted
our
friend
s
assistance
and
it
was
my
secret
belief
that
at
sight
of
him
erme
would
pull
round
his
own
belief
was
scarcely
to
be
called
secret
it
discernibly
at
any
rate
differed
from
mine
he
had
showed
me
gwendolen
s
photograph
with
the
remark
that
she
wasn
t
pretty
but
was
awfully
interesting
she
had
published
at
the
age
of
nineteen
a
novel
in
three
volumes
deep
down
about
which
in
he
had
been
really
splendid
he
appreciated
my
present
eagerness
and
undertook
that
the
periodical
in
question
should
do
no
less
then
at
the
last
with
his
hand
on
the
door
he
said
to
me
of
course
you
ll
be
all
right
you
seeing
i
was
a
trifle
vague
he
added
i
mean
you
won
t
be
vereker
why
what
do
i
ever
find
him
but
awfully
clever
well
what
s
that
but
silly
what
on
earth
does
awfully
clever
mean
for
god
s
sake
try
to
get
him
don
t
let
him
suffer
by
our
arrangement
speak
of
him
you
know
if
you
can
as
should
have
spoken
of
i
wondered
an
instant
you
mean
as
far
and
away
the
biggest
of
the
sort
of
thing
corvick
almost
groaned
oh
you
know
i
don
t
put
them
back
to
back
that
way
it
s
the
infancy
of
art
but
he
gives
me
a
pleasure
so
rare
the
sense
of
mused
a
something
or
i
wondered
again
the
sense
pray
of
want
my
dear
man
that
s
just
what
i
want
to
say
even
before
he
had
banged
the
door
i
had
begun
book
in
hand
to
prepare
myself
to
say
it
i
sat
up
with
vereker
half
the
night
corvick
couldn
t
have
done
more
than
that
he
was
awfully
stuck
to
that
but
he
wasn
t
a
bit
the
biggest
of
the
lot
i
didn
t
allude
to
the
lot
however
i
flattered
myself
that
i
emerged
on
this
occasion
from
the
infancy
of
art
it
s
all
right
they
declared
vividly
at
the
office
and
when
the
number
appeared
i
felt
there
was
a
basis
on
which
i
could
meet
the
great
man
it
gave
me
confidence
for
a
day
or
that
confidence
dropped
i
had
fancied
him
reading
it
with
relish
but
if
corvick
wasn
t
satisfied
how
could
vereker
himself
be
i
reflected
indeed
that
the
heat
of
the
admirer
was
sometimes
grosser
even
than
the
appetite
of
the
scribe
corvick
at
all
events
wrote
me
from
paris
a
little
erme
was
pulling
round
and
i
hadn
t
at
all
said
what
vereker
gave
him
the
sense
of
chapter
ii
the
effect
of
my
visit
to
bridges
was
to
turn
me
out
for
more
profundity
hugh
vereker
as
i
saw
him
there
was
of
a
contact
so
void
of
angles
that
i
blushed
for
the
poverty
of
imagination
involved
in
my
small
precautions
if
he
was
in
spirits
it
wasn
t
because
he
had
read
my
review
in
fact
on
the
sunday
morning
i
felt
sure
he
hadn
t
read
it
though
had
been
out
three
days
and
bloomed
i
assured
myself
in
the
stiff
garden
of
periodicals
which
gave
one
of
the
ormolu
tables
the
air
of
a
stand
at
a
station
the
impression
he
made
on
me
personally
was
such
that
i
wished
him
to
read
it
and
i
corrected
to
this
end
with
a
surreptitious
hand
what
might
be
wanting
in
the
careless
conspicuity
of
the
sheet
i
m
afraid
i
even
watched
the
result
of
my
manœuvre
but
up
to
luncheon
i
watched
in
vain
when
afterwards
in
the
course
of
our
gregarious
walk
i
found
myself
for
half
an
hour
not
perhaps
without
another
manœuvre
at
the
great
man
s
side
the
result
of
his
affability
was
a
still
livelier
desire
that
he
shouldn
t
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
peculiar
justice
i
had
done
him
it
wasn
t
that
he
seemed
to
thirst
for
justice
on
the
contrary
i
hadn
t
yet
caught
in
his
talk
the
faintest
grunt
of
a
note
for
which
my
young
experience
had
already
given
me
an
ear
of
late
he
had
had
more
recognition
and
it
was
pleasant
as
we
used
to
say
in
to
see
how
it
drew
him
out
he
wasn
t
of
course
popular
but
i
judged
one
of
the
sources
of
his
good
humour
to
be
precisely
that
his
success
was
independent
of
that
he
had
none
the
less
become
in
a
manner
the
fashion
the
critics
at
least
had
put
on
a
spurt
and
caught
up
with
him
we
had
found
out
at
last
how
clever
he
was
and
he
had
had
to
make
the
best
of
the
loss
of
his
mystery
i
was
strongly
tempted
as
i
walked
beside
him
to
let
him
know
how
much
of
that
unveiling
was
my
act
and
there
was
a
moment
when
i
probably
should
have
done
so
had
not
one
of
the
ladies
of
our
party
snatching
a
place
at
his
other
elbow
just
then
appealed
to
him
in
a
spirit
comparatively
selfish
it
was
very
discouraging
i
almost
felt
the
liberty
had
been
taken
with
myself
i
had
had
on
my
tongue
s
end
for
my
own
part
a
phrase
or
two
about
the
right
word
at
the
right
time
but
later
on
i
was
glad
not
to
have
spoken
for
when
on
our
return
we
clustered
at
tea
i
perceived
lady
jane
who
had
not
been
out
with
us
brandishing
with
her
longest
arm
she
had
taken
it
up
at
her
leisure
she
was
delighted
with
what
she
had
found
and
i
saw
that
as
a
mistake
in
a
man
may
often
be
a
felicity
in
a
woman
she
would
practically
do
for
me
what
i
hadn
t
been
able
to
do
for
myself
some
sweet
little
truths
that
needed
to
be
spoken
i
heard
her
declare
thrusting
the
paper
at
rather
a
bewildered
couple
by
the
fireplace
she
grabbed
it
away
from
them
again
on
the
reappearance
of
hugh
vereker
who
after
our
walk
had
been
upstairs
to
change
something
i
know
you
don
t
in
general
look
at
this
kind
of
thing
but
it
s
an
occasion
really
for
doing
so
you
seen
it
then
you
must
the
man
has
actually
got
you
at
what
always
feel
you
lady
jane
threw
into
her
eyes
a
look
evidently
intended
to
give
an
idea
of
what
she
always
felt
but
she
added
that
she
couldn
t
have
expressed
it
the
man
in
the
paper
expressed
it
in
a
striking
manner
just
see
there
and
there
where
i
ve
dashed
it
how
he
brings
it
she
had
literally
marked
for
him
the
brightest
patches
of
my
prose
and
if
i
was
a
little
amused
vereker
himself
may
well
have
been
he
showed
how
much
he
was
when
before
us
all
lady
jane
wanted
to
read
something
aloud
i
liked
at
any
rate
the
way
he
defeated
her
purpose
by
jerking
the
paper
affectionately
out
of
her
clutch
he
d
take
it
upstairs
with
him
and
look
at
it
on
going
to
dress
he
did
this
half
an
hour
saw
it
in
his
hand
when
he
repaired
to
his
room
that
was
the
moment
at
which
thinking
to
give
her
pleasure
i
mentioned
to
lady
jane
that
i
was
the
author
of
the
review
i
did
give
her
pleasure
i
judged
but
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
as
i
had
expected
if
the
author
was
only
me
the
thing
didn
t
seem
quite
so
remarkable
hadn
t
i
had
the
effect
rather
of
diminishing
the
lustre
of
the
article
than
of
adding
to
my
own
her
ladyship
was
subject
to
the
most
extraordinary
drops
it
didn
t
matter
the
only
effect
i
cared
about
was
the
one
it
would
have
on
vereker
up
there
by
his
bedroom
fire
at
dinner
i
watched
for
the
signs
of
this
impression
tried
to
fancy
some
happier
light
in
his
eyes
but
to
my
disappointment
lady
jane
gave
me
no
chance
to
make
sure
i
had
hoped
she
d
call
triumphantly
down
the
table
publicly
demand
if
she
hadn
t
been
right
the
party
was
were
people
from
outside
as
well
but
i
had
never
seen
a
table
long
enough
to
deprive
lady
jane
of
a
triumph
i
was
just
reflecting
in
truth
that
this
interminable
board
would
deprive
of
one
when
the
guest
next
me
dear
was
miss
poyle
the
vicar
s
sister
a
robust
unmodulated
the
happy
inspiration
and
the
unusual
courage
to
address
herself
across
it
to
vereker
who
was
opposite
but
not
directly
so
that
when
he
replied
they
were
both
leaning
forward
she
enquired
artless
body
what
he
thought
of
lady
jane
s
panegyric
which
she
had
connecting
it
however
with
her
neighbour
and
while
i
strained
my
ear
for
his
reply
i
heard
him
to
my
stupefaction
call
back
gaily
his
mouth
full
of
bread
oh
it
s
all
usual
twaddle
i
had
caught
vereker
s
glance
as
he
spoke
but
miss
poyle
s
surprise
was
a
fortunate
cover
for
my
own
you
mean
he
doesn
t
do
you
justice
said
the
excellent
woman
vereker
laughed
out
and
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
it
s
a
charming
article
he
tossed
us
miss
poyle
thrust
her
chin
half
across
the
cloth
oh
you
re
so
deep
she
drove
home
as
deep
as
the
ocean
all
i
pretend
is
that
the
author
doesn
t
but
a
dish
was
at
this
point
passed
over
his
shoulder
and
we
had
to
wait
while
he
helped
himself
doesn
t
see
what
my
neighbour
continued
doesn
t
see
dear
very
stupid
not
a
bit
vereker
laughed
main
nobody
the
lady
on
his
further
side
appealed
to
him
and
miss
poyle
sank
back
to
myself
nobody
sees
anything
she
cheerfully
announced
to
which
i
replied
that
i
had
often
thought
so
too
but
had
somehow
taken
the
thought
for
a
proof
on
my
own
part
of
a
tremendous
eye
i
didn
t
tell
her
the
article
was
mine
and
i
observed
that
lady
jane
occupied
at
the
end
of
the
table
had
not
caught
vereker
s
words
i
rather
avoided
him
after
dinner
for
i
confess
he
struck
me
as
cruelly
conceited
and
the
revelation
was
a
pain
the
usual
twaddle
acute
little
study
that
one
s
admiration
should
have
had
a
reserve
or
two
could
gall
him
to
that
point
i
had
thought
him
placid
and
he
was
placid
enough
such
a
surface
was
the
hard
polished
glass
that
encased
the
bauble
of
his
vanity
i
was
really
ruffled
and
the
only
comfort
was
that
if
nobody
saw
anything
george
corvick
was
quite
as
much
out
of
it
as
i
this
comfort
however
was
not
sufficient
after
the
ladies
had
dispersed
to
carry
me
in
the
proper
mean
in
a
spotted
jacket
and
humming
an
the
i
took
my
way
in
some
dejection
to
bed
but
in
the
passage
i
encountered
vereker
who
had
been
up
once
more
to
change
coming
out
of
his
room
was
humming
an
air
and
had
on
a
spotted
jacket
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
his
gaiety
gave
a
start
my
dear
young
man
he
exclaimed
i
m
so
glad
to
lay
hands
on
you
i
m
afraid
i
most
unwittingly
wounded
you
by
those
words
of
mine
at
dinner
to
miss
poyle
i
learned
but
half
an
hour
ago
from
lady
jane
that
you
re
the
author
of
the
little
notice
in
i
protested
that
no
bones
were
broken
but
he
moved
with
me
to
my
own
door
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
kindly
feeling
for
a
fracture
and
on
hearing
that
i
had
come
up
to
bed
he
asked
leave
to
cross
my
threshold
and
just
tell
me
in
three
words
what
his
qualification
of
my
remarks
had
represented
it
was
plain
he
really
feared
i
was
hurt
and
the
sense
of
his
solicitude
suddenly
made
all
the
difference
to
me
my
cheap
review
fluttered
off
into
space
and
the
best
things
i
had
said
in
it
became
flat
enough
beside
the
brilliancy
of
his
being
there
i
can
see
him
there
still
on
my
rug
in
the
firelight
and
his
spotted
jacket
his
fine
clear
face
all
bright
with
the
desire
to
be
tender
to
my
youth
i
don
t
know
what
he
had
at
first
meant
to
say
but
i
think
the
sight
of
my
relief
touched
him
excited
him
brought
up
words
to
his
lips
from
far
within
it
was
so
these
words
presently
conveyed
to
me
something
that
as
i
afterwards
knew
he
had
never
uttered
to
any
one
i
ve
always
done
justice
to
the
generous
impulse
that
made
him
speak
it
was
simply
compunction
for
a
snub
unconsciously
administered
to
a
man
of
letters
in
a
position
inferior
to
his
own
a
man
of
letters
moreover
in
the
very
act
of
praising
him
to
make
the
thing
right
he
talked
to
me
exactly
as
an
equal
and
on
the
ground
of
what
we
both
loved
best
the
hour
the
place
the
unexpectedness
deepened
the
impression
he
couldn
t
have
done
anything
more
intensely
effective
chapter
iii
i
don
t
quite
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
he
said
but
it
was
the
very
fact
that
your
notice
of
my
book
had
a
spice
of
intelligence
it
was
just
your
exceptional
sharpness
that
produced
the
very
old
story
with
me
i
beg
you
to
the
momentary
influence
of
which
i
used
in
speaking
to
that
good
lady
the
words
you
so
naturally
resent
i
don
t
read
the
things
in
the
newspapers
unless
they
re
thrust
upon
me
as
that
one
s
always
one
s
best
friend
who
does
it
but
i
used
to
read
them
years
ago
i
dare
say
they
were
in
general
rather
stupider
then
at
any
rate
it
always
struck
me
they
missed
my
little
point
with
a
perfection
exactly
as
admirable
when
they
patted
me
on
the
back
as
when
they
kicked
me
in
the
shins
whenever
since
i
ve
happened
to
have
a
glimpse
of
them
they
were
still
blazing
missing
it
i
mean
deliciously
miss
it
my
dear
fellow
with
inimitable
assurance
the
fact
of
your
being
awfully
clever
and
your
article
s
being
awfully
nice
doesn
t
make
a
hair
s
breadth
of
difference
it
s
quite
with
you
rising
young
men
vereker
laughed
that
i
feel
most
what
a
failure
i
am
i
listened
with
keen
interest
it
grew
keener
as
he
talked
a
what
then
may
your
little
point
happen
to
be
have
i
got
to
you
after
all
these
years
and
labours
there
was
something
in
the
friendly
reproach
of
made
me
as
an
ardent
young
seeker
for
truth
blush
to
the
roots
of
my
hair
i
m
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
though
i
ve
grown
used
in
a
sense
to
my
obtuseness
at
that
moment
however
vereker
s
happy
accent
made
me
appear
to
myself
and
probably
to
him
a
rare
dunce
i
was
on
the
point
of
exclaiming
ah
yes
don
t
tell
me
for
my
honour
for
that
of
the
craft
don
t
when
he
went
on
in
a
manner
that
showed
he
had
read
my
thought
and
had
his
own
idea
of
the
probability
of
our
some
day
redeeming
ourselves
by
my
little
point
i
shall
i
call
it
particular
thing
i
ve
written
my
books
most
isn
t
there
for
every
writer
a
particular
thing
of
that
sort
the
thing
that
most
makes
him
apply
himself
the
thing
without
the
effort
to
achieve
which
he
wouldn
t
write
at
all
the
very
passion
of
his
passion
the
part
of
the
business
in
which
for
him
the
flame
of
art
burns
most
intensely
well
it
s
i
considered
a
is
i
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
rather
gasping
i
was
you
ll
say
but
i
wasn
t
going
after
all
to
be
put
off
my
guard
your
description
s
certainly
beautiful
but
it
doesn
t
make
what
you
describe
very
i
promise
you
it
would
be
distinct
if
it
should
dawn
on
you
at
i
saw
that
the
charm
of
our
topic
overflowed
for
my
companion
into
an
emotion
as
lively
as
my
own
at
any
rate
he
went
on
i
can
speak
for
myself
there
s
an
idea
in
my
work
without
which
i
wouldn
t
have
given
a
straw
for
the
whole
job
it
s
the
finest
fullest
intention
of
the
lot
and
the
application
of
it
has
been
i
think
a
triumph
of
patience
of
ingenuity
i
ought
to
leave
that
to
somebody
else
to
say
but
that
nobody
does
say
it
is
precisely
what
we
re
talking
about
it
stretches
this
little
trick
of
mine
from
book
to
book
and
everything
else
comparatively
plays
over
the
surface
of
it
the
order
the
form
the
texture
of
my
books
will
perhaps
some
day
constitute
for
the
initiated
a
complete
representation
of
it
so
it
s
naturally
the
thing
for
the
critic
to
look
for
it
strikes
me
my
visitor
added
smiling
even
as
the
thing
for
the
critic
to
this
seemed
a
responsibility
indeed
you
call
it
a
little
trick
that
s
only
my
little
modesty
it
s
really
an
exquisite
and
you
hold
that
you
ve
carried
the
scheme
out
the
way
i
ve
carried
it
out
is
the
thing
in
life
i
think
a
bit
well
of
myself
i
had
a
pause
don
t
you
think
you
a
assist
the
critic
assist
him
what
else
have
i
done
with
every
stroke
of
my
pen
i
ve
shouted
my
intention
in
his
great
blank
face
at
this
laughing
out
again
vereker
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
to
show
the
allusion
wasn
t
to
my
personal
appearance
but
you
talk
about
the
initiated
there
must
therefore
you
see
what
else
in
heaven
s
name
is
criticism
supposed
to
be
i
m
afraid
i
coloured
at
this
too
but
i
took
refuge
in
repeating
that
his
account
of
his
silver
lining
was
poor
in
something
or
other
that
a
plain
man
knows
things
by
that
s
only
because
you
ve
never
had
a
glimpse
of
it
he
returned
if
you
had
had
one
the
element
in
question
would
soon
have
become
practically
all
you
d
see
to
me
it
s
exactly
as
palpable
as
the
marble
of
this
chimney
besides
the
critic
just
a
plain
man
if
he
were
pray
what
would
he
be
doing
in
his
neighbour
s
garden
you
re
anything
but
a
plain
man
yourself
and
the
very
raison
d
être
of
you
all
is
that
you
re
little
demons
of
subtlety
if
my
great
affair
s
a
secret
that
s
only
because
it
s
a
secret
in
spite
of
amazing
event
has
made
it
one
i
not
only
never
took
the
smallest
precaution
to
keep
it
so
but
never
dreamed
of
any
such
accident
if
i
had
i
shouldn
t
in
advance
have
had
the
heart
to
go
on
as
it
was
i
only
became
aware
little
by
little
and
meanwhile
i
had
done
my
and
now
you
quite
like
it
i
risked
my
work
your
secret
it
s
the
same
your
guessing
that
vereker
replied
is
a
proof
that
you
re
as
clever
as
i
say
i
was
encouraged
by
this
to
remark
that
he
would
clearly
be
pained
to
part
with
it
and
he
confessed
that
it
was
indeed
with
him
now
the
great
amusement
of
life
i
live
almost
to
see
if
it
will
ever
be
he
looked
at
me
for
a
jesting
challenge
something
far
within
his
eyes
seemed
to
peep
out
but
i
needn
t
won
t
you
fire
me
as
i
ve
never
been
fired
i
declared
you
make
me
determined
to
do
or
then
i
asked
is
it
a
kind
of
esoteric
message
his
countenance
fell
at
put
out
his
hand
as
if
to
bid
me
ah
my
dear
fellow
it
can
t
be
described
in
cheap
journalese
i
knew
of
course
he
d
be
awfully
fastidious
but
our
talk
had
made
me
feel
how
much
his
nerves
were
exposed
i
was
kept
hold
of
his
hand
i
won
t
make
use
of
the
expression
then
i
said
in
the
article
in
which
i
shall
eventually
announce
my
discovery
though
i
dare
say
i
shall
have
hard
work
to
do
without
it
but
meanwhile
just
to
hasten
that
difficult
birth
can
t
you
give
a
fellow
a
clue
i
felt
much
more
at
my
ease
my
whole
lucid
effort
gives
him
the
page
and
line
and
letter
the
thing
s
as
concrete
there
as
a
bird
in
a
cage
a
bait
on
a
hook
a
piece
of
cheese
in
a
it
s
stuck
into
every
volume
as
your
foot
is
stuck
into
your
shoe
it
governs
every
line
it
chooses
every
word
it
dots
every
i
it
places
every
i
scratched
my
head
is
it
something
in
the
style
or
something
in
the
thought
an
element
of
form
or
an
element
of
feeling
he
indulgently
shook
my
hand
again
and
i
felt
my
questions
to
be
crude
and
my
distinctions
pitiful
my
dear
t
bother
about
it
after
all
you
do
like
a
and
a
little
intelligence
might
spoil
it
i
still
detained
him
he
hesitated
well
you
ve
got
a
heart
in
your
body
is
that
an
element
of
form
or
an
element
of
feeling
what
i
contend
that
nobody
has
ever
mentioned
in
my
work
is
the
organ
of
i
s
some
idea
life
some
sort
of
philosophy
unless
it
be
i
added
with
the
eagerness
of
a
thought
perhaps
still
happier
some
kind
of
game
you
re
up
to
with
your
style
something
you
re
after
in
the
language
perhaps
it
s
a
preference
for
the
letter
p
i
ventured
profanely
to
break
out
papa
potatoes
sort
of
thing
he
was
suitably
indulgent
he
only
said
i
hadn
t
got
the
right
letter
but
his
amusement
was
over
i
could
see
he
was
bored
there
was
nevertheless
something
else
i
had
absolutely
to
learn
should
you
be
able
pen
in
hand
to
state
it
clearly
name
it
phrase
it
formulate
it
oh
he
almost
passionately
sighed
if
i
were
only
pen
in
hand
one
of
chaps
that
would
be
a
great
chance
for
you
of
course
but
why
should
you
despise
us
chaps
for
not
doing
what
you
can
t
do
yourself
can
t
do
he
opened
his
eyes
haven
t
i
done
it
in
twenty
volumes
i
do
it
in
my
way
he
continued
go
and
don
t
do
it
in
ours
is
so
devilish
difficult
i
weakly
observed
so
s
mine
we
each
choose
our
own
there
s
no
compulsion
you
won
t
come
down
and
smoke
no
i
want
to
think
this
thing
you
ll
tell
me
then
in
the
morning
that
you
ve
laid
me
bare
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
i
ll
sleep
on
it
but
just
one
word
more
i
added
we
had
left
the
walked
again
with
him
a
few
steps
along
the
passage
this
extraordinary
general
intention
as
you
call
that
s
the
most
vivid
description
i
can
induce
you
to
make
of
then
generally
a
sort
of
buried
treasure
his
face
lighted
yes
call
it
that
though
it
s
perhaps
not
for
me
to
do
nonsense
i
laughed
you
know
you
re
hugely
proud
of
well
i
didn
t
propose
to
tell
you
so
but
it
the
joy
of
my
soul
you
mean
it
s
a
beauty
so
rare
so
great
he
waited
a
little
again
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
world
we
had
stopped
and
on
these
words
he
left
me
but
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
while
i
looked
after
him
rather
yearningly
he
turned
and
caught
sight
of
my
puzzled
face
it
made
him
earnestly
indeed
i
thought
quite
anxiously
shake
his
head
and
wave
his
finger
give
it
it
up
this
wasn
t
a
was
fatherly
advice
if
i
had
had
one
of
his
books
at
hand
i
d
have
repeated
my
recent
act
of
d
have
spent
half
the
night
with
him
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
not
sleeping
remembering
moreover
how
indispensable
he
was
to
lady
jane
i
stole
down
to
the
library
with
a
candle
there
wasn
t
so
far
as
i
could
discover
a
line
of
his
writing
in
the
house
chapter
iv
returning
to
town
i
feverishly
collected
them
all
i
picked
out
each
in
its
order
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
this
gave
me
a
maddening
month
in
the
course
of
which
several
things
took
place
one
of
these
the
last
i
may
as
well
immediately
mention
was
that
i
acted
on
vereker
s
advice
i
renounced
my
ridiculous
attempt
i
could
really
make
nothing
of
the
business
it
proved
a
dead
loss
after
all
i
had
always
as
he
had
himself
noted
liked
him
and
what
now
occurred
was
simply
that
my
new
intelligence
and
vain
preoccupation
damaged
my
liking
i
not
only
failed
to
run
a
general
intention
to
earth
i
found
myself
missing
the
subordinate
intentions
i
had
formerly
enjoyed
his
books
didn
t
even
remain
the
charming
things
they
had
been
for
me
the
exasperation
of
my
search
put
me
out
of
conceit
of
them
instead
of
being
a
pleasure
the
more
they
became
a
resource
the
less
for
from
the
moment
i
was
unable
to
follow
up
the
author
s
hint
i
of
course
felt
it
a
point
of
honour
not
to
make
use
professionally
of
my
knowledge
of
them
i
no
had
any
it
was
humiliating
but
i
could
bear
only
annoyed
me
now
at
last
they
even
bored
me
and
i
accounted
for
my
i
the
idea
that
vereker
had
made
a
fool
of
me
the
buried
treasure
was
a
bad
joke
the
general
intention
a
monstrous
pose
the
great
point
of
it
all
is
however
that
i
told
george
corvick
what
had
befallen
me
and
that
my
information
had
an
immense
effect
upon
him
he
had
at
last
come
back
but
so
unfortunately
had
erme
and
there
was
as
yet
i
could
see
no
question
of
his
nuptials
he
was
immensely
stirred
up
by
the
anecdote
i
had
brought
from
bridges
it
fell
in
so
completely
with
the
sense
he
had
had
from
the
first
that
there
was
more
in
vereker
than
met
the
eye
when
i
remarked
that
the
eye
seemed
what
the
printed
page
had
been
expressly
invented
to
meet
he
immediately
accused
me
of
being
spiteful
because
i
had
been
foiled
our
commerce
had
always
that
pleasant
latitude
the
thing
vereker
had
mentioned
to
me
was
exactly
the
thing
he
corvick
had
wanted
me
to
speak
of
in
my
review
on
my
suggesting
at
last
that
with
the
assistance
i
had
now
given
him
he
would
doubtless
be
prepared
to
speak
of
it
himself
he
admitted
freely
that
before
doing
this
there
was
more
he
must
understand
what
he
would
have
said
had
he
reviewed
the
new
book
was
that
there
was
evidently
in
the
writer
s
inmost
art
something
to
understood
i
hadn
t
so
much
as
hinted
at
that
no
wonder
the
writer
hadn
t
been
flattered
i
asked
corvick
what
he
really
considered
he
meant
by
his
own
supersubtlety
and
unmistakeably
kindled
he
replied
it
isn
t
for
the
isn
t
for
the
vulgar
he
had
hold
of
the
tail
of
something
he
would
pull
hard
pull
it
right
out
he
pumped
me
dry
on
vereker
s
strange
confidence
and
pronouncing
me
the
luckiest
of
mortals
mentioned
half
a
dozen
questions
he
wished
to
goodness
i
had
had
the
gumption
to
put
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
didn
t
want
to
be
told
too
would
spoil
the
fun
of
seeing
what
would
come
the
failure
of
fun
was
at
the
moment
of
our
meeting
not
complete
but
i
saw
it
ahead
and
corvick
saw
that
i
saw
it
i
on
my
side
saw
likewise
that
one
of
the
first
things
he
would
do
would
be
to
rush
off
with
my
story
to
gwendolen
on
the
very
day
after
my
talk
with
him
i
was
surprised
by
the
receipt
of
a
note
from
hugh
vereker
to
whom
our
encounter
at
bridges
had
been
recalled
as
he
mentioned
by
his
falling
in
a
magazine
on
some
article
to
which
my
signature
was
attached
i
read
it
with
great
pleasure
he
wrote
and
remembered
under
its
influence
our
lively
conversation
by
your
bedroom
fire
the
consequence
of
this
has
been
that
i
begin
to
measure
the
temerity
of
my
having
saddled
you
with
a
knowledge
that
you
may
find
something
of
a
burden
now
that
the
fit
s
over
i
can
t
imagine
how
i
came
to
be
moved
so
much
beyond
my
wont
i
had
never
before
mentioned
no
matter
in
what
state
of
expansion
the
fact
of
my
little
secret
and
i
shall
never
speak
of
that
mystery
again
i
was
accidentally
so
much
more
explicit
with
you
than
it
had
ever
entered
into
my
game
to
be
that
i
find
this
mean
the
pleasure
of
playing
considerably
in
short
if
you
can
understand
it
i
ve
rather
spoiled
my
sport
i
really
don
t
want
to
give
anybody
what
i
believe
you
clever
young
men
call
the
tip
that
s
of
course
a
selfish
solicitude
and
i
name
it
to
you
for
what
it
may
be
worth
to
you
if
you
re
disposed
to
humour
me
don
t
repeat
my
revelation
think
me
s
your
right
but
don
t
tell
anybody
the
sequel
to
this
communication
was
that
as
early
on
the
morrow
as
i
dared
i
drove
straight
to
vereker
s
door
he
occupied
in
those
years
one
of
the
honest
old
houses
in
kensington
square
he
received
me
immediately
and
as
soon
as
i
came
in
i
saw
i
hadn
t
lost
my
power
to
minister
to
his
mirth
he
laughed
out
at
sight
of
my
face
which
doubtless
expressed
my
perturbation
i
had
been
compunction
was
great
i
told
somebody
i
panted
and
i
m
sure
that
person
will
by
this
time
have
told
somebody
else
it
s
a
woman
into
the
the
person
you
ve
told
no
the
other
person
i
m
quite
sure
he
must
have
told
for
all
the
good
it
will
do
do
a
woman
will
never
find
no
but
she
ll
talk
all
over
the
place
she
ll
do
just
what
you
don
t
vereker
thought
a
moment
but
wasn
t
so
disconcerted
as
i
had
feared
he
felt
that
if
the
harm
was
done
it
only
served
him
right
it
doesn
t
t
i
ll
do
my
best
i
promise
you
that
your
talk
with
me
shall
go
no
very
good
do
what
you
in
the
meantime
i
pursued
george
corvick
s
possession
of
the
tip
may
on
his
part
really
lead
to
that
will
be
a
brave
i
told
him
about
corvick
s
cleverness
his
admiration
the
intensity
of
his
interest
in
my
anecdote
and
without
making
too
much
of
the
divergence
of
our
respective
estimates
mentioned
that
my
friend
was
already
of
opinion
that
he
saw
much
further
into
a
certain
affair
than
most
people
he
was
quite
as
fired
as
i
had
been
at
bridges
he
was
moreover
in
love
with
the
young
lady
perhaps
the
two
together
would
puzzle
something
out
vereker
seemed
struck
with
this
do
you
mean
they
re
to
be
married
i
dare
say
that
s
what
it
will
come
that
may
help
them
he
conceded
but
we
must
give
them
time
i
spoke
of
my
own
renewed
assault
and
confessed
my
difficulties
whereupon
he
repeated
his
former
advice
give
it
up
give
it
up
he
evidently
didn
t
think
me
intellectually
equipped
for
the
adventure
i
stayed
half
an
hour
and
he
was
most
but
i
couldn
t
help
pronouncing
him
a
man
of
unstable
moods
he
had
been
free
with
me
in
a
mood
he
had
repented
in
a
mood
and
now
in
a
mood
he
had
turned
indifferent
this
general
levity
helped
me
to
believe
that
so
far
as
the
subject
of
the
tip
went
there
wasn
t
much
in
it
i
contrived
however
to
make
him
answer
a
few
more
questions
about
it
though
he
did
so
with
visible
impatience
for
himself
beyond
doubt
the
thing
we
were
all
so
blank
about
was
vividly
there
it
was
something
i
guessed
in
the
primal
plan
something
like
a
complex
figure
in
a
persian
carpet
he
highly
approved
of
this
image
when
i
used
it
and
he
used
another
himself
it
s
the
very
string
he
said
that
my
pearls
are
strung
on
the
reason
of
his
note
to
me
had
been
that
he
really
didn
t
want
to
give
us
a
grain
of
density
was
a
thing
too
perfect
in
its
way
to
touch
he
had
formed
the
habit
of
depending
on
it
and
if
the
spell
was
to
break
it
must
break
by
some
force
of
its
own
he
comes
back
to
me
from
that
last
i
was
never
to
speak
to
him
a
man
with
some
safe
preserve
for
sport
i
wondered
as
i
walked
away
where
he
had
got
tip
chapter
when
i
spoke
to
george
corvick
of
the
caution
i
had
received
he
made
me
feel
that
any
doubt
of
his
delicacy
would
be
almost
an
insult
he
had
instantly
told
gwendolen
but
gwendolen
s
ardent
response
was
in
itself
a
pledge
of
discretion
the
question
would
now
absorb
them
and
would
offer
them
a
pastime
too
precious
to
be
shared
with
the
crowd
they
appeared
to
have
caught
instinctively
at
vereker
s
high
idea
of
enjoyment
their
intellectual
pride
however
was
not
such
as
to
make
them
indifferent
to
any
further
light
i
might
throw
on
the
affair
they
had
in
hand
they
were
indeed
of
the
artistic
temperament
and
i
was
freshly
struck
with
my
colleague
s
power
to
excite
himself
over
a
question
of
art
he
d
call
it
letters
he
d
call
it
life
but
it
was
all
one
thing
in
what
he
said
i
now
seemed
to
understand
that
he
spoke
equally
for
gwendolen
to
whom
as
soon
as
erme
was
sufficiently
better
to
allow
her
a
little
leisure
he
made
a
point
of
introducing
me
i
remember
our
going
together
one
sunday
in
august
to
a
huddled
house
in
chelsea
and
my
renewed
envy
of
corvick
s
possession
of
a
friend
who
had
some
light
to
mingle
with
his
own
he
could
say
things
to
her
that
i
could
never
say
to
him
she
had
indeed
no
sense
of
humour
and
with
her
pretty
way
of
holding
her
head
on
one
side
was
one
of
those
persons
whom
you
want
as
the
phrase
is
to
shake
but
who
have
learnt
hungarian
by
themselves
she
conversed
perhaps
in
hungarian
with
corvick
she
had
remarkably
little
english
for
his
friend
corvick
afterwards
told
me
that
i
had
chilled
her
by
my
apparent
indisposition
to
oblige
them
with
the
detail
of
what
vereker
had
said
to
me
i
allowed
that
i
felt
i
had
given
thought
enough
to
that
indication
hadn
t
i
even
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
vain
and
would
lead
nowhere
the
importance
they
attached
to
it
was
irritating
and
quite
envenomed
my
doubts
that
statement
looks
unamiable
and
what
probably
happened
was
that
i
felt
humiliated
at
seeing
other
persons
deeply
beguiled
by
an
experiment
that
had
brought
me
only
chagrin
i
was
out
in
the
cold
while
by
the
evening
fire
under
the
lamp
they
followed
the
chase
for
which
i
myself
had
sounded
the
horn
they
did
as
i
had
done
only
more
deliberately
and
went
over
their
author
from
the
beginning
there
was
no
hurry
corvick
said
the
future
was
before
them
and
the
fascination
could
only
grow
they
would
take
him
page
by
page
as
they
would
take
one
of
the
classics
inhale
him
in
slow
draughts
and
let
him
sink
all
the
way
in
they
would
scarce
have
got
so
wound
up
i
think
if
they
hadn
t
been
in
love
poor
vereker
s
inner
meaning
gave
them
endless
occasion
to
put
and
to
keep
their
young
heads
together
none
the
less
it
represented
the
kind
of
problem
for
which
corvick
had
a
special
aptitude
drew
out
the
particular
pointed
patience
of
which
had
he
lived
he
would
have
given
more
striking
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
more
fruitful
examples
he
at
least
was
in
vereker
s
words
a
little
demon
of
subtlety
we
had
begun
by
disputing
but
i
soon
saw
that
without
my
stirring
a
finger
his
infatuation
would
have
its
bad
hours
he
would
bound
off
on
false
scents
as
i
had
would
clap
his
hands
over
new
lights
and
see
them
blown
out
by
the
wind
of
the
turned
page
he
was
like
nothing
i
told
him
but
the
maniacs
who
embrace
some
bedlamitical
theory
of
the
cryptic
character
of
shakespeare
to
this
he
replied
that
if
we
had
had
shakespeare
s
own
word
for
his
being
cryptic
he
would
at
once
have
accepted
it
the
case
there
was
altogether
had
nothing
but
the
word
of
snooks
i
returned
that
i
was
stupefied
to
see
him
attach
such
importance
even
to
the
word
of
vereker
he
wanted
thereupon
to
know
if
i
treated
vereker
s
word
as
a
lie
i
wasn
t
perhaps
prepared
in
my
unhappy
rebound
to
go
so
far
as
that
but
i
insisted
that
till
the
contrary
was
proved
i
should
view
it
as
too
fond
an
imagination
i
didn
t
i
confess
didn
t
at
that
time
quite
i
felt
deep
down
as
miss
erme
would
have
said
i
was
uneasy
i
was
expectant
at
the
core
of
my
disconcerted
my
wonted
curiosity
lived
in
its
the
sharpness
of
a
sense
that
corvick
would
at
last
probably
come
out
somewhere
he
made
in
defence
of
his
credulity
a
great
point
of
the
fact
that
from
of
old
in
his
study
of
this
genius
he
had
caught
whiffs
and
hints
of
he
didn
t
know
what
faint
wandering
notes
of
a
hidden
music
that
was
just
the
rarity
that
was
the
charm
it
fitted
so
perfectly
into
what
i
reported
if
i
returned
on
several
occasions
to
the
little
house
in
chelsea
i
dare
say
it
was
as
much
for
news
of
vereker
as
for
news
of
miss
erme
s
ailing
parent
the
hours
spent
there
by
corvick
were
present
to
my
fancy
as
those
of
a
chessplayer
bent
with
a
silent
scowl
all
the
lamplit
winter
over
his
board
and
his
moves
as
my
imagination
filled
it
out
the
picture
held
me
fast
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
a
ghostlier
form
the
faint
figure
of
an
antagonist
but
a
little
wearily
antagonist
who
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
smile
on
his
fine
clear
face
close
to
corvick
behind
him
was
a
girl
who
had
begun
to
strike
me
as
pale
and
wasted
and
even
on
more
familiar
view
as
rather
handsome
and
who
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
hung
on
his
moves
he
would
take
up
a
chessman
and
hold
it
poised
a
while
over
one
of
the
little
squares
and
then
would
put
it
back
in
its
place
with
a
long
sigh
of
disappointment
the
young
lady
at
this
would
slightly
but
uneasily
shift
her
position
and
look
across
very
hard
very
long
very
strangely
at
their
dim
participant
i
had
asked
them
at
an
early
stage
of
the
business
if
it
mightn
t
contribute
to
their
success
to
have
some
closer
communication
with
him
the
special
circumstances
would
surely
be
held
to
have
given
me
a
right
to
introduce
them
corvick
immediately
replied
that
he
had
no
wish
to
approach
the
altar
before
he
had
prepared
the
sacrifice
he
quite
agreed
with
our
friend
both
as
to
the
delight
and
as
to
the
honour
of
the
would
bring
down
the
animal
with
his
own
rifle
when
i
asked
him
if
miss
erme
were
as
keen
a
shot
he
said
after
thinking
no
i
m
ashamed
to
say
she
wants
to
set
a
trap
she
d
give
anything
to
see
him
she
says
she
requires
another
tip
she
s
really
quite
morbid
about
it
but
she
must
play
see
him
he
emphatically
added
i
wondered
if
they
hadn
t
even
quarrelled
a
little
on
the
suspicion
not
corrected
by
the
way
he
more
than
once
exclaimed
to
me
she
s
quite
incredibly
literary
you
fantastically
i
remember
his
saying
of
her
that
she
felt
in
italics
and
thought
in
capitals
oh
when
i
ve
run
him
to
earth
he
also
said
then
you
know
i
shall
knock
at
his
door
beg
you
to
believe
i
ll
have
it
from
his
own
lips
right
you
are
my
boy
you
ve
done
it
this
time
he
shall
crown
me
the
critical
meanwhile
he
really
avoided
the
chances
london
life
might
have
given
him
of
meeting
the
distinguished
novelist
a
danger
however
that
disappeared
with
vereker
s
leaving
england
for
an
indefinite
absence
as
the
newspapers
to
the
south
for
motives
connected
with
the
health
of
his
wife
which
had
long
kept
her
in
retirement
a
than
a
elapsed
since
the
incident
at
bridges
but
i
had
had
no
further
sight
of
him
i
think
i
was
at
bottom
rather
hated
to
remind
him
that
though
i
had
irremediably
missed
his
point
a
reputation
for
acuteness
was
rapidly
overtaking
me
this
scruple
led
me
a
dance
kept
me
out
of
lady
jane
s
house
made
me
even
decline
when
in
spite
of
my
bad
manners
she
was
a
second
time
so
good
as
to
make
me
a
sign
an
invitation
to
her
beautiful
seat
i
once
became
aware
of
her
under
vereker
s
escort
at
a
concert
and
was
sure
i
was
seen
by
them
but
i
slipped
out
without
being
caught
i
felt
as
on
that
occasion
i
splashed
along
in
the
rain
that
i
couldn
t
have
done
anything
else
and
yet
i
remember
saying
to
myself
that
it
was
hard
was
even
cruel
not
only
had
i
lost
the
books
but
i
had
lost
the
man
himself
they
and
their
author
had
been
alike
spoiled
for
me
i
knew
too
which
was
the
loss
i
most
regretted
i
had
taken
to
the
man
still
more
than
i
had
ever
taken
to
the
books
chapter
vi
six
months
after
our
friend
had
left
england
george
corvick
who
made
his
living
by
his
pen
contracted
for
a
piece
of
work
which
imposed
on
him
an
absence
of
some
length
and
a
journey
of
some
difficulty
and
his
undertaking
of
which
was
much
of
a
surprise
to
me
his
had
become
editor
of
a
great
provincial
paper
and
the
great
provincial
paper
in
a
fine
flight
of
fancy
had
conceived
the
idea
of
sending
a
special
commissioner
to
india
special
commissioners
had
begun
in
the
metropolitan
press
to
be
the
fashion
and
the
journal
in
question
must
have
felt
it
had
passed
too
long
for
a
mere
country
cousin
corvick
had
no
hand
i
knew
for
the
big
brush
of
the
correspondent
but
that
was
his
s
affair
and
the
fact
that
a
particular
task
was
not
in
his
line
was
apt
to
be
with
himself
exactly
a
reason
for
accepting
it
he
was
prepared
to
the
metropolitan
press
he
took
solemn
precautions
against
priggishness
he
exquisitely
outraged
taste
nobody
ever
knew
offended
principle
was
all
his
own
in
addition
to
his
expenses
he
was
to
be
conveniently
paid
and
i
found
myself
able
to
help
him
for
the
usual
fat
book
to
a
plausible
arrangement
with
the
usual
fat
publisher
i
naturally
inferred
that
his
obvious
desire
to
make
a
little
money
was
not
unconnected
with
the
prospect
of
a
union
with
gwendolen
erme
i
was
aware
that
her
mother
s
opposition
was
largely
addressed
to
his
want
of
means
and
of
lucrative
abilities
but
it
so
happened
that
on
my
saying
the
last
time
i
saw
him
something
that
bore
on
the
question
of
his
separation
from
our
young
lady
he
brought
out
with
an
emphasis
that
startled
me
ah
i
m
not
a
bit
engaged
to
her
you
know
not
overtly
i
answered
because
her
mother
doesn
t
like
you
but
i
ve
always
taken
for
granted
a
private
well
there
one
but
there
isn
t
that
was
all
he
said
save
something
about
erme
s
having
got
on
her
feet
again
in
the
most
extraordinary
remark
pointing
as
i
supposed
the
moral
that
private
understandings
were
of
little
use
when
the
doctor
didn
t
share
them
what
i
took
the
liberty
of
more
closely
inferring
was
that
the
girl
might
in
some
way
have
estranged
him
well
if
he
had
taken
the
turn
of
jealousy
for
instance
it
could
scarcely
be
jealousy
of
me
in
that
and
above
the
absurdity
of
wouldn
t
have
gone
away
just
to
leave
us
together
for
some
time
before
his
going
we
had
indulged
in
no
allusion
to
the
buried
treasure
and
from
his
silence
which
my
reserve
simply
emulated
i
had
drawn
a
sharp
conclusion
his
courage
had
dropped
his
ardour
had
gone
the
way
of
appearance
at
least
he
left
me
to
scan
more
than
that
he
couldn
t
do
he
couldn
t
face
the
triumph
with
which
i
might
have
greeted
an
explicit
admission
he
needn
t
have
been
afraid
poor
dear
for
i
had
by
this
time
lost
all
need
to
triumph
in
fact
i
considered
i
showed
magnanimity
in
not
reproaching
him
with
his
collapse
for
the
sense
of
his
having
thrown
up
the
game
made
me
feel
more
than
ever
how
much
i
at
last
depended
on
him
if
corvick
had
broken
down
i
should
never
know
no
one
would
be
of
any
use
if
wasn
t
it
wasn
t
a
bit
true
i
had
ceased
to
care
for
knowledge
little
by
little
my
curiosity
not
only
had
begun
to
ache
again
but
had
become
the
familiar
torment
of
my
days
and
my
nights
there
are
doubtless
people
to
whom
torments
of
such
an
order
appear
hardly
more
natural
than
the
contortions
of
disease
but
i
don
t
after
all
know
why
i
should
in
this
connexion
so
much
as
mention
them
for
the
few
persons
at
any
rate
abnormal
or
not
with
whom
my
anecdote
is
concerned
literature
was
a
game
of
skill
and
skill
meant
courage
and
courage
meant
honour
and
honour
meant
passion
meant
life
the
stake
on
the
table
was
of
a
special
substance
and
our
roulette
the
revolving
mind
but
we
sat
round
the
green
board
as
intently
as
the
grim
gamblers
at
monte
carlo
gwendolen
erme
for
that
matter
with
her
white
face
and
her
fixed
eyes
was
of
the
very
type
of
the
lean
ladies
one
had
met
in
the
temples
of
chance
i
recognised
in
corvick
s
absence
that
she
made
this
analogy
vivid
it
was
extravagant
i
admit
the
way
she
lived
for
the
art
of
the
pen
her
passion
visibly
preyed
on
her
and
in
her
presence
i
felt
almost
tepid
i
got
hold
of
deep
down
again
it
was
a
desert
in
which
she
had
lost
herself
but
in
which
too
she
had
dug
a
wonderful
hole
in
the
cavity
out
of
which
corvick
had
still
more
remarkably
pulled
her
early
in
march
i
had
a
telegram
from
her
in
consequence
of
which
i
repaired
immediately
to
chelsea
where
the
first
thing
she
said
to
me
was
he
has
got
it
he
has
got
it
she
was
moved
as
i
could
see
to
such
depths
that
she
must
mean
the
great
thing
vereker
s
idea
his
general
intention
george
has
cabled
from
she
had
the
missive
open
there
it
was
emphatic
though
concise
eureka
that
was
had
saved
the
cost
of
the
signature
i
shared
her
emotion
but
i
was
disappointed
he
doesn
t
say
what
it
how
could
a
telegram
he
ll
write
but
how
does
he
know
know
it
s
the
real
thing
oh
i
m
sure
that
when
you
see
it
you
do
know
vera
incessu
patuit
dea
it
s
you
miss
erme
who
are
a
dear
for
bringing
me
such
news
went
all
lengths
in
my
high
spirits
but
fancy
finding
our
goddess
in
the
temple
of
vishnu
how
strange
of
george
to
have
been
able
to
go
into
the
thing
again
in
the
midst
of
such
different
and
such
powerful
solicitations
he
hasn
t
gone
into
it
i
know
it
s
the
thing
itself
let
severely
alone
for
six
months
that
has
simply
sprung
out
at
him
like
a
tigress
out
of
the
jungle
he
didn
t
take
a
book
with
purpose
indeed
he
wouldn
t
have
needed
knows
every
page
as
i
do
by
heart
they
all
worked
in
him
together
and
some
day
somewhere
when
he
wasn
t
thinking
they
fell
in
all
their
superb
intricacy
into
the
one
right
combination
the
figure
in
the
carpet
came
out
that
s
the
way
he
knew
it
would
come
and
the
real
didn
t
in
the
least
understand
but
i
suppose
i
may
tell
you
he
went
and
why
i
consented
to
his
going
we
knew
the
change
would
do
the
difference
of
thought
of
scene
would
give
the
needed
touch
the
magic
shake
we
had
perfectly
we
had
admirably
calculated
the
elements
were
all
in
his
mind
and
in
the
secousse
of
a
new
and
intense
experience
they
just
struck
she
positively
struck
light
was
literally
facially
luminous
i
stammered
something
about
unconscious
cerebration
and
she
continued
he
ll
come
right
will
bring
to
see
vereker
you
mean
to
see
to
see
think
what
he
ll
have
to
tell
me
i
hesitated
about
india
about
fiddlesticks
about
the
figure
in
the
but
as
you
say
we
shall
surely
have
that
in
a
she
thought
like
one
inspired
and
i
remembered
how
corvick
had
told
me
long
before
that
her
face
was
interesting
perhaps
it
can
t
be
got
into
a
letter
if
it
s
perhaps
not
if
it
s
immense
bosh
if
he
has
hold
of
something
that
can
t
be
got
into
a
letter
he
hasn
t
hold
of
thing
vereker
s
own
statement
to
me
was
exactly
that
the
figure
fit
into
a
well
i
cabled
to
george
an
hour
words
said
gwendolen
is
it
indiscreet
of
me
to
ask
what
they
were
she
hung
fire
but
at
last
brought
them
out
angel
good
i
exclaimed
i
ll
make
it
ll
send
him
the
chapter
vii
my
words
however
were
not
absolutely
the
put
something
instead
of
angel
and
in
the
sequel
my
epithet
seemed
the
more
apt
for
when
eventually
we
heard
from
our
traveller
it
was
merely
it
was
thoroughly
to
be
tantalised
he
was
magnificent
in
his
triumph
he
described
his
discovery
as
stupendous
but
his
ecstasy
only
obscured
were
to
be
no
particulars
till
he
should
have
submitted
his
conception
to
the
supreme
authority
he
had
thrown
up
his
commission
he
had
thrown
up
his
book
he
had
thrown
up
everything
but
the
instant
need
to
hurry
to
rapallo
on
the
genoese
shore
where
vereker
was
making
a
stay
i
wrote
him
a
letter
which
was
to
await
him
at
besought
him
to
relieve
my
suspense
that
he
had
found
my
letter
was
indicated
by
a
telegram
which
reaching
me
after
weary
days
and
in
the
absence
of
any
answer
to
my
laconic
dispatch
to
him
at
bombay
was
evidently
intended
as
a
reply
to
both
communications
those
few
words
were
in
familiar
french
the
french
of
the
day
which
covick
often
made
use
of
to
show
he
wasn
t
a
prig
it
had
for
some
persons
the
opposite
effect
but
his
message
may
fairly
be
paraphrased
have
patience
i
want
to
see
as
it
breaks
on
you
the
face
you
ll
make
tellement
envie
de
voir
ta
tête
was
what
i
had
to
sit
down
with
i
can
certainly
not
be
said
to
have
sat
down
for
i
seem
to
remember
myself
at
this
time
as
rattling
constantly
between
the
little
house
in
chelsea
and
my
own
our
impatience
gwendolen
s
and
mine
was
equal
but
i
kept
hoping
her
light
would
be
greater
we
all
spent
during
this
episode
for
people
of
our
means
a
great
deal
of
money
in
telegrams
and
cabs
and
i
counted
on
the
receipt
of
news
from
rapallo
immediately
after
the
junction
of
the
discoverer
with
the
discovered
the
interval
seemed
an
age
but
late
one
day
i
heard
a
hansom
precipitated
to
my
door
with
the
crash
engendered
by
a
hint
of
liberality
i
lived
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
and
accordingly
bounded
to
the
movement
which
gave
me
a
view
of
a
young
lady
erect
on
the
footboard
of
the
vehicle
and
eagerly
looking
up
at
my
house
at
sight
of
me
she
flourished
a
paper
with
a
movement
that
brought
me
straight
down
the
movement
with
which
in
melodramas
handkerchiefs
and
reprieves
are
flourished
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
just
seen
a
note
wrong
pressed
me
to
me
a
so
much
i
read
on
her
paper
while
the
cabby
dropped
a
grin
from
his
perch
in
my
excitement
i
paid
him
profusely
and
in
hers
she
suffered
it
then
as
he
drove
away
we
started
to
walk
about
and
talk
we
had
talked
heaven
knows
enough
before
but
this
was
a
wondrous
lift
we
pictured
the
whole
scene
at
rapallo
where
he
would
have
written
mentioning
my
name
for
permission
to
call
that
is
pictured
it
having
more
material
than
my
companion
whom
i
felt
hang
on
my
lips
as
we
stopped
on
purpose
before
we
didn
t
look
into
about
one
thing
we
were
clear
if
he
was
staying
on
for
fuller
communication
we
should
at
least
have
a
letter
from
him
that
would
help
us
through
the
dregs
of
delay
we
understood
his
staying
on
and
yet
each
of
us
saw
i
think
that
the
other
hated
it
the
letter
we
were
clear
about
arrived
it
was
for
gwendolen
and
i
called
on
her
in
time
to
save
her
the
trouble
of
bringing
it
to
me
she
didn
t
read
it
out
as
was
natural
enough
but
she
repeated
to
me
what
it
chiefly
embodied
this
consisted
of
the
remarkable
statement
that
he
d
tell
her
after
they
were
married
exactly
what
she
wanted
to
know
only
when
i
m
his
before
she
explained
it
s
tantamount
to
t
it
i
must
marry
him
straight
off
she
smiled
at
me
while
i
flushed
with
disappointment
a
vision
of
fresh
delay
that
made
me
at
first
unconscious
of
my
surprise
it
seemed
more
than
a
hint
that
on
me
as
well
he
would
impose
some
tiresome
condition
suddenly
while
she
reported
several
more
things
from
his
letter
i
remembered
what
he
had
told
me
before
going
away
he
had
found
vereker
deliriously
interesting
and
his
own
possession
of
the
secret
a
real
intoxication
the
buried
treasure
was
all
gold
and
gems
now
that
it
was
there
it
seemed
to
grow
and
grow
before
him
it
would
have
been
through
all
time
and
taking
all
tongues
one
of
the
most
wonderful
flowers
of
literary
art
nothing
in
especial
once
you
were
face
to
face
with
it
could
show
for
more
consummately
when
once
it
came
out
it
came
out
was
there
with
a
splendour
that
made
you
ashamed
and
there
hadn
t
been
save
in
the
bottomless
vulgarity
of
the
age
with
every
one
tasteless
and
tainted
every
sense
stopped
the
smallest
reason
why
it
should
have
been
overlooked
it
was
great
yet
so
simple
was
simple
yet
so
great
and
the
final
knowledge
of
it
was
an
experience
quite
apart
he
intimated
that
the
charm
of
such
an
experience
the
desire
to
drain
it
in
its
freshness
to
the
last
drop
was
what
kept
him
there
close
to
the
source
gwendolen
frankly
radiant
as
she
tossed
me
these
fragments
showed
the
elation
of
a
prospect
more
assured
than
my
own
that
brought
me
back
to
the
question
of
her
marriage
prompted
me
to
ask
if
what
she
meant
by
what
she
had
just
surprised
me
with
was
that
she
was
under
an
engagement
of
course
i
am
she
answered
didn
t
you
know
it
she
seemed
astonished
but
i
was
still
more
so
for
corvick
had
told
me
the
exact
contrary
i
didn
t
mention
this
however
i
only
reminded
her
how
little
i
had
been
on
that
score
in
her
confidence
or
even
in
corvick
s
and
that
moreover
i
wasn
t
in
ignorance
of
her
mother
s
interdict
at
bottom
i
was
troubled
by
the
disparity
of
the
two
accounts
but
after
a
little
i
felt
corvick
s
to
be
the
one
i
least
doubted
this
simply
reduced
me
to
asking
myself
if
the
girl
had
on
the
spot
improvised
an
up
an
old
one
or
dashed
off
a
order
to
arrive
at
the
satisfaction
she
desired
she
must
have
had
resources
of
which
i
was
destitute
but
she
made
her
case
slightly
more
intelligible
by
returning
presently
what
the
state
of
things
has
been
is
that
we
felt
of
course
bound
to
do
nothing
in
mamma
s
but
now
you
think
you
ll
just
dispense
with
mamma
s
consent
ah
it
mayn
t
come
to
that
i
wondered
what
it
might
come
to
and
she
went
on
poor
dear
she
may
swallow
the
dose
in
fact
you
know
she
added
with
a
laugh
she
really
proposition
of
which
on
behalf
of
every
one
concerned
i
fully
acknowledged
the
force
chapter
viii
nothing
more
vexatious
had
ever
happened
to
me
than
to
become
aware
before
corvick
s
arrival
in
england
that
i
shouldn
t
be
there
to
put
him
through
i
found
myself
abruptly
called
to
germany
by
the
alarming
illness
of
my
younger
brother
who
against
my
advice
had
gone
to
munich
to
study
at
the
feet
indeed
of
a
great
master
the
art
of
portraiture
in
oils
the
near
relative
who
made
him
an
allowance
had
threatened
to
withdraw
it
if
he
should
under
specious
pretexts
turn
for
superior
truth
to
being
somehow
for
a
cheltenham
aunt
the
school
of
evil
the
abyss
i
deplored
this
prejudice
at
the
time
and
the
deep
injury
of
it
was
now
in
the
fact
that
it
hadn
t
saved
the
poor
boy
who
was
clever
frail
and
foolish
from
congestion
of
the
lungs
and
second
in
the
greater
break
with
london
to
which
the
event
condemned
me
i
m
afraid
that
what
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
during
several
anxious
weeks
was
the
sense
that
if
we
had
only
been
in
paris
i
might
have
run
over
to
see
corvick
this
was
actually
out
of
the
question
from
every
point
of
view
my
brother
whose
recovery
gave
us
both
plenty
to
do
was
ill
for
three
months
during
which
i
never
left
him
and
at
the
end
of
which
we
had
to
face
the
absolute
prohibition
of
a
return
to
england
the
consideration
of
climate
imposed
itself
and
he
was
in
no
state
to
meet
it
alone
i
took
him
to
meran
and
there
spent
the
summer
with
him
trying
to
show
him
by
example
how
to
get
back
to
work
and
nursing
a
rage
of
another
sort
that
i
tried
to
show
him
the
whole
business
proved
the
first
of
a
series
of
phenomena
so
strangely
interlaced
that
taken
was
how
i
had
to
take
form
as
good
an
illustration
as
i
can
recall
of
the
manner
in
which
for
the
good
of
his
soul
doubtless
fate
sometimes
deals
with
a
man
s
avidity
these
incidents
certainly
had
larger
bearings
than
the
comparatively
meagre
consequence
we
are
here
concerned
i
feel
that
consequence
also
a
thing
to
speak
of
with
some
respect
it
s
mainly
in
such
a
light
i
confess
at
any
rate
that
the
ugly
fruit
of
my
exile
is
at
this
hour
present
to
me
even
at
first
indeed
the
spirit
in
which
my
avidity
as
i
have
called
it
made
me
regard
that
term
owed
no
element
of
ease
to
the
fact
that
before
coming
back
from
rapallo
george
corvick
addressed
me
in
a
way
i
objected
to
his
letter
had
none
of
the
sedative
action
i
must
profess
myself
sure
he
had
wished
to
give
it
and
the
march
of
occurrences
was
not
so
ordered
as
to
make
up
for
what
it
lacked
he
had
begun
on
the
spot
for
one
of
the
quarterlies
a
great
last
word
on
vereker
s
writings
and
this
exhaustive
study
the
only
one
that
would
have
counted
have
existed
was
to
turn
on
the
new
light
to
so
quietly
unimagined
truth
it
was
in
other
words
to
trace
the
figure
in
the
carpet
through
every
convolution
to
reproduce
it
in
every
tint
the
result
according
to
my
friend
would
be
the
greatest
literary
portrait
ever
painted
and
what
he
asked
of
me
was
just
to
be
so
good
as
not
to
trouble
him
with
questions
till
he
should
hang
up
his
masterpiece
before
me
he
did
me
the
honour
to
declare
that
putting
aside
the
great
sitter
himself
all
aloft
in
his
indifference
i
was
individually
the
connoisseur
he
was
most
working
for
i
was
therefore
to
be
a
good
boy
and
not
try
to
peep
under
the
curtain
before
the
show
was
ready
i
should
enjoy
it
all
the
more
if
i
sat
very
still
i
did
my
best
to
sit
very
still
but
i
couldn
t
help
giving
a
jump
on
seeing
in
after
i
had
been
a
week
or
two
in
munich
and
before
as
i
knew
corvick
had
reached
london
the
announcement
of
the
sudden
death
of
poor
erme
i
instantly
by
letter
appealed
to
gwendolen
for
particulars
and
she
wrote
me
that
her
mother
had
yielded
to
failure
of
the
heart
she
didn
t
say
but
i
took
the
liberty
of
reading
into
her
words
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
her
marriage
and
also
of
her
eagerness
which
was
quite
a
match
for
mine
this
was
a
solution
more
prompt
than
could
have
been
expected
and
more
radical
than
waiting
for
the
old
lady
to
swallow
the
dose
i
candidly
admit
indeed
that
at
the
i
heard
from
her
read
some
singular
things
into
gwendolen
s
words
and
some
still
more
extraordinary
ones
into
her
silences
pen
in
hand
this
way
i
live
the
time
over
and
it
brings
back
the
oddest
sense
of
my
having
been
both
for
months
and
in
spite
of
myself
a
kind
of
coerced
spectator
all
my
life
had
taken
refuge
in
my
eyes
which
the
procession
of
events
appeared
to
have
committed
itself
to
keep
astare
there
were
days
when
i
thought
of
writing
to
hugh
vereker
and
simply
throwing
myself
on
his
charity
but
i
felt
more
deeply
that
i
hadn
t
fallen
quite
so
which
quite
properly
he
would
send
me
about
my
business
erme
s
death
brought
corvick
straight
home
and
within
the
month
he
was
united
very
quietly
quietly
i
seemed
to
make
out
as
he
meant
in
his
article
to
bring
out
his
the
young
lady
he
had
loved
and
quitted
i
use
this
last
term
i
may
parenthetically
say
because
i
subsequently
grew
sure
that
at
the
time
he
went
to
india
at
the
time
of
his
great
news
from
bombay
there
had
been
no
positive
pledge
between
them
whatever
there
had
been
none
at
the
moment
she
was
affirming
to
me
the
very
opposite
on
the
other
hand
he
had
certainly
become
engaged
the
day
he
returned
the
happy
pair
went
down
to
torquay
for
their
honeymoon
and
there
in
a
reckless
hour
it
occurred
to
poor
corvick
to
take
his
young
bride
a
drive
he
had
no
command
of
that
business
this
had
been
brought
home
to
me
of
old
in
a
little
tour
we
had
once
made
together
in
a
dogcart
in
a
dogcart
he
perched
his
companion
for
a
rattle
over
devonshire
hills
on
one
of
the
likeliest
of
which
he
brought
his
horse
who
it
was
true
had
bolted
down
with
such
violence
that
the
occupants
of
the
cart
were
hurled
forward
and
that
he
fell
horribly
on
his
head
he
was
killed
on
the
spot
gwendolen
escaped
unhurt
i
pass
rapidly
over
the
question
of
this
unmitigated
tragedy
of
what
the
loss
of
my
best
friend
meant
for
me
and
i
complete
my
little
history
of
my
patience
and
my
pain
by
the
frank
statement
of
my
having
in
a
postscript
to
my
very
first
letter
to
her
after
the
receipt
of
the
hideous
news
asked
corvick
whether
her
husband
mightn
t
at
least
have
finished
the
great
article
on
vereker
her
answer
was
as
prompt
as
my
question
the
article
which
had
been
barely
begun
was
a
mere
heartbreaking
scrap
she
explained
that
our
friend
abroad
had
just
settled
down
to
it
when
interrupted
by
her
mother
s
death
and
that
then
on
his
return
he
had
been
kept
from
work
by
the
engrossments
into
which
that
calamity
was
to
plunge
them
the
opening
pages
were
all
that
existed
they
were
striking
they
were
promising
but
they
didn
t
unveil
the
idol
that
great
intellectual
feat
was
obviously
to
have
formed
his
climax
she
said
nothing
more
nothing
to
enlighten
me
as
to
the
state
of
her
own
knowledge
for
the
acquisition
of
which
i
had
fancied
her
prodigiously
acting
this
was
above
all
what
i
wanted
to
know
had
seen
the
idol
unveiled
had
there
been
a
private
ceremony
for
a
palpitating
audience
of
one
for
what
else
but
that
ceremony
had
the
nuptials
taken
place
i
didn
t
like
as
yet
to
press
her
though
when
i
thought
of
what
had
passed
between
us
on
the
subject
in
corvick
s
absence
her
reticence
surprised
me
it
was
therefore
not
till
much
later
from
meran
that
i
risked
another
appeal
risked
it
in
some
trepidation
for
she
continued
to
tell
me
nothing
did
you
hear
in
those
few
days
of
your
blighted
bliss
i
wrote
what
we
desired
so
to
hear
i
said
we
as
a
little
hint
and
she
showed
me
she
could
take
a
little
hint
i
heard
everything
she
replied
and
i
mean
to
keep
it
to
myself
chapter
ix
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
moved
with
the
strongest
sympathy
for
her
and
on
my
return
to
england
i
showed
her
every
kindness
in
my
power
her
mother
s
death
had
made
her
means
sufficient
and
she
had
gone
to
live
in
a
more
convenient
quarter
but
her
loss
had
been
great
and
her
visitation
cruel
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
me
moreover
to
suppose
she
could
come
to
feel
the
possession
of
a
technical
tip
of
a
piece
of
literary
experience
a
counterpoise
to
her
grief
strange
to
say
none
the
less
i
couldn
t
help
believing
after
i
had
seen
her
a
few
times
that
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
such
oddity
i
hasten
to
add
that
there
had
been
other
things
i
couldn
t
help
believing
or
at
least
imagining
and
as
i
never
felt
i
was
really
clear
about
these
so
as
to
the
point
i
here
touch
on
i
give
her
memory
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
stricken
and
solitary
highly
accomplished
and
now
in
her
deep
mourning
her
maturer
grace
and
her
uncomplaining
sorrow
incontestably
handsome
she
presented
herself
as
leading
a
life
of
singular
dignity
and
beauty
i
had
at
first
found
a
way
to
persuade
myself
that
i
should
soon
get
the
better
of
the
reserve
formulated
the
week
after
the
catastrophe
in
her
reply
to
an
appeal
as
to
which
i
was
not
unconscious
that
it
might
strike
her
as
mistimed
certainly
that
reserve
was
something
of
a
shock
to
it
puzzled
me
the
more
i
thought
of
it
and
even
though
i
tried
to
explain
it
with
moments
of
success
by
an
imputation
of
exalted
sentiments
of
superstitious
scruples
of
a
refinement
of
loyalty
certainly
it
added
at
the
same
time
hugely
to
the
price
of
vereker
s
secret
precious
as
this
mystery
already
appeared
i
may
as
well
confess
abjectly
that
corvick
s
unexpected
attitude
was
the
final
tap
on
the
nail
that
was
to
fix
fast
my
luckless
idea
convert
it
into
the
obsession
of
which
i
m
for
ever
conscious
but
this
only
helped
me
the
more
to
be
artful
to
be
adroit
to
allow
time
to
elapse
before
renewing
my
suit
there
were
plenty
of
speculations
for
the
interval
and
one
of
them
was
deeply
absorbing
corvick
had
kept
his
information
from
his
young
friend
till
after
the
removal
of
the
last
barrier
to
their
only
had
he
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
was
it
gwendolen
s
idea
taking
a
hint
from
him
to
liberate
this
animal
only
on
the
basis
of
the
renewal
of
such
a
relation
was
the
figure
in
the
carpet
traceable
or
describable
only
for
husbands
and
lovers
supremely
united
it
came
back
to
me
in
a
mystifying
manner
that
in
kensington
square
when
i
mentioned
that
corvick
would
have
told
the
girl
he
loved
some
word
had
dropped
from
vereker
that
gave
colour
to
this
possibility
there
might
be
little
in
it
but
there
was
enough
to
make
me
wonder
if
i
should
have
to
marry
corvick
to
get
what
i
wanted
was
i
prepared
to
offer
her
this
price
for
the
blessing
of
her
knowledge
ah
that
way
madness
lay
i
at
least
said
to
myself
in
bewildered
hours
i
could
see
meanwhile
the
torch
she
refused
to
pass
on
flame
away
in
her
chamber
of
through
her
eyes
a
light
that
shone
in
her
lonely
house
at
the
end
of
six
months
i
was
fully
sure
of
what
this
warm
presence
made
up
to
her
for
we
had
talked
again
and
again
of
the
man
who
had
brought
us
his
talent
his
character
his
personal
charm
his
certain
career
his
dreadful
doom
and
even
of
his
clear
purpose
in
that
great
study
which
was
to
have
been
a
supreme
literary
portrait
a
kind
of
critical
vandyke
or
velasquez
she
had
conveyed
to
me
in
abundance
that
she
was
by
her
perversity
by
her
piety
that
she
would
never
break
the
silence
it
had
not
been
given
to
the
right
person
as
she
said
to
break
the
hour
however
finally
arrived
one
evening
when
i
had
been
sitting
with
her
longer
than
usual
i
laid
my
hand
firmly
on
her
arm
now
at
last
what
it
she
had
been
expecting
me
and
was
ready
she
gave
a
long
slow
soundless
headshake
merciful
only
in
being
inarticulate
this
mercy
didn
t
prevent
its
hurling
at
me
the
largest
finest
coldest
never
i
had
yet
in
the
course
of
a
life
that
had
known
denials
had
to
take
full
in
the
face
i
took
it
and
was
aware
that
with
the
hard
blow
the
tears
had
come
into
my
eyes
so
for
a
while
we
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
after
which
i
slowly
rose
i
was
wondering
if
some
day
she
would
accept
me
but
this
was
not
what
i
brought
out
i
said
as
i
smoothed
down
my
hat
i
know
what
to
think
then
it
s
nothing
a
remote
disdainful
pity
for
me
gathered
in
her
dim
smile
then
she
spoke
in
a
voice
that
i
hear
at
this
hour
it
s
my
as
i
stood
at
the
door
she
added
you
ve
insulted
him
do
you
mean
vereker
i
mean
the
dead
i
recognised
when
i
reached
the
street
the
justice
of
her
charge
yes
it
was
her
recognised
that
too
but
her
life
none
the
less
made
room
with
the
lapse
of
time
for
another
interest
a
year
and
a
half
after
corvick
s
death
she
published
in
a
single
volume
her
second
novel
overmastered
which
i
pounced
on
in
the
hope
of
finding
in
it
some
echo
or
some
peeping
face
all
i
found
was
a
much
better
book
than
her
younger
performance
showing
i
thought
the
better
company
she
had
kept
as
a
tissue
tolerably
intricate
it
was
a
carpet
with
a
figure
of
its
own
but
the
figure
was
not
the
figure
i
was
looking
for
on
sending
a
review
of
it
to
i
was
surprised
to
learn
from
the
office
that
a
notice
was
already
in
type
when
the
paper
came
out
i
had
no
hesitation
in
attributing
this
article
which
i
thought
rather
vulgarly
overdone
to
drayton
deane
who
in
the
old
days
had
been
something
of
a
friend
of
corvick
s
yet
had
only
within
a
few
weeks
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
widow
i
had
had
an
early
copy
of
the
book
but
deane
had
evidently
had
an
earlier
he
lacked
all
the
same
the
light
hand
with
which
corvick
had
gilded
the
laid
on
the
tinsel
in
splotches
chapter
x
six
months
later
appeared
the
right
of
way
the
last
chance
though
we
didn
t
know
it
that
we
were
to
have
to
redeem
ourselves
written
wholly
during
vereker
s
sojourn
abroad
the
book
had
been
heralded
in
a
hundred
paragraphs
by
the
usual
ineptitudes
i
carried
it
as
early
a
copy
as
any
i
this
time
flattered
myself
straightway
to
corvick
this
was
the
only
use
i
had
for
it
i
left
the
inevitable
tribute
of
to
some
more
ingenious
mind
and
some
less
irritated
temper
but
i
already
have
it
gwendolen
said
drayton
deane
was
so
good
as
to
bring
it
to
me
yesterday
and
i
ve
just
finished
yesterday
how
did
he
get
it
so
soon
he
gets
everything
so
soon
he
s
to
review
it
in
vereker
i
couldn
t
believe
my
ears
why
not
one
fine
ignorance
is
as
good
as
i
winced
but
i
presently
said
you
ought
to
review
him
yourself
i
don
t
review
she
laughed
i
m
reviewed
just
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
ah
yes
here
s
your
reviewer
drayton
deane
was
there
with
his
long
legs
and
his
tall
forehead
he
had
come
to
see
what
she
thought
of
the
right
of
way
and
to
bring
news
that
was
singularly
relevant
the
evening
papers
were
just
out
with
a
telegram
on
the
author
of
that
work
who
in
rome
had
been
ill
for
some
days
with
an
attack
of
malarial
fever
it
had
at
first
not
been
thought
grave
but
had
taken
in
consequence
of
complications
a
turn
that
might
give
rise
to
anxiety
anxiety
had
indeed
at
the
latest
hour
begun
to
be
felt
i
was
struck
in
the
presence
of
these
tidings
with
the
fundamental
detachment
that
corvick
s
overt
concern
quite
failed
to
hide
it
gave
me
the
measure
of
her
consummate
independence
that
independence
rested
on
her
knowledge
the
knowledge
which
nothing
now
could
destroy
and
which
nothing
could
make
different
the
figure
in
the
carpet
might
take
on
another
twist
or
two
but
the
sentence
had
virtually
been
written
the
writer
might
go
down
to
his
grave
she
was
the
person
in
the
world
to
if
she
had
been
his
favoured
continued
existence
was
least
of
a
need
this
reminded
me
how
i
had
observed
at
a
particular
corvick
s
drop
of
her
desire
to
see
him
face
to
face
she
had
got
what
she
wanted
without
that
i
had
been
sure
that
if
she
hadn
t
got
it
she
wouldn
t
have
been
restrained
from
the
endeavour
to
sound
him
personally
by
those
superior
reflexions
more
conceivable
on
a
man
s
part
than
on
a
woman
s
which
in
my
case
had
served
an
a
deterrent
it
wasn
t
however
i
hasten
to
add
that
my
case
in
spite
of
this
invidious
comparison
wasn
t
ambiguous
enough
at
the
thought
that
vereker
was
perhaps
at
that
moment
dying
there
rolled
over
me
a
wave
of
poignant
sense
of
how
inconsistently
i
still
depended
on
him
a
delicacy
that
it
was
my
one
compensation
to
suffer
to
rule
me
had
left
the
alps
and
the
apennines
between
us
but
the
sense
of
the
waning
occasion
suggested
that
i
might
in
my
despair
at
last
have
gone
to
him
of
course
i
should
really
have
done
nothing
of
the
sort
i
remained
five
minutes
while
my
companions
talked
of
the
new
book
and
when
drayton
deane
appealed
to
me
for
my
opinion
of
it
i
made
answer
getting
up
that
i
detested
hugh
vereker
and
simply
couldn
t
read
him
i
departed
with
the
moral
certainty
that
as
the
door
closed
behind
me
deane
would
brand
me
for
awfully
superficial
his
hostess
wouldn
t
contradict
at
least
i
continue
to
trace
with
a
briefer
touch
our
intensely
odd
successions
three
weeks
after
this
came
vereker
s
death
and
before
the
year
was
out
the
death
of
his
wife
that
poor
lady
i
had
never
seen
but
i
had
had
a
futile
theory
that
should
she
survive
him
long
enough
to
be
decorously
accessible
i
might
approach
her
with
the
feeble
flicker
of
my
plea
did
she
know
and
if
she
knew
would
she
speak
it
was
much
to
be
presumed
that
for
more
reasons
than
one
she
would
have
nothing
to
say
but
when
she
passed
out
of
all
reach
i
felt
renannouncement
indeed
my
appointed
lot
i
was
shut
up
in
my
obsession
for
gaolers
had
gone
off
with
the
key
i
find
myself
quite
as
vague
as
a
captive
in
a
dungeon
about
the
tinge
that
further
elapsed
before
corvick
became
the
wife
of
drayton
deane
i
had
foreseen
through
my
bars
this
end
of
the
business
though
there
was
no
indecent
haste
and
our
friendship
had
fallen
rather
off
they
were
both
so
awfully
intellectual
that
it
struck
people
as
a
suitable
match
but
i
had
measured
better
than
any
one
the
wealth
of
understanding
the
bride
would
contribute
to
the
union
never
for
a
marriage
in
literary
the
newspapers
described
the
a
lady
been
so
bravely
dowered
i
began
with
due
promptness
to
look
for
the
fruit
of
the
fruit
i
mean
of
which
the
premonitory
symptoms
would
be
peculiarly
visible
in
the
husband
taking
for
granted
the
splendour
of
the
other
party
s
nuptial
gift
i
expected
to
see
him
make
a
show
commensurate
with
his
increase
of
means
i
knew
what
his
means
had
article
on
the
right
of
way
had
distinctly
given
one
the
figure
as
he
was
now
exactly
in
the
position
in
which
still
more
exactly
i
was
not
i
watched
from
month
to
month
in
the
likely
periodicals
for
the
heavy
message
poor
corvick
had
been
unable
to
deliver
and
the
responsibility
of
which
would
have
fallen
on
his
successor
the
widow
and
wife
would
have
broken
by
the
rekindled
hearth
the
silence
that
only
a
widow
and
wife
might
break
and
deane
would
be
as
aflame
with
the
knowledge
as
corvick
in
his
own
hour
as
gwendolen
in
hers
had
been
well
he
was
aflame
doubtless
but
the
fire
was
apparently
not
to
become
a
public
blaze
i
scanned
the
periodicals
in
vain
drayton
deane
filled
them
with
exuberant
pages
but
he
withheld
the
page
i
most
feverishly
sought
he
wrote
on
a
thousand
subjects
but
never
on
the
subject
of
vereker
his
special
line
was
to
tell
truths
that
other
people
either
funked
as
he
said
or
overlooked
but
he
never
told
the
only
truth
that
seemed
to
me
in
these
days
to
signify
i
met
the
couple
in
those
literary
circles
referred
to
in
the
papers
i
have
sufficiently
intimated
that
it
was
only
in
such
circles
we
were
all
constructed
to
revolve
gwendolen
was
more
than
ever
committed
to
them
by
the
publication
of
her
third
novel
and
i
myself
definitely
classed
by
holding
the
opinion
that
this
work
was
inferior
to
its
immediate
predecessor
was
it
worse
because
she
had
been
keeping
worse
company
if
her
secret
was
as
she
had
told
me
her
fact
discernible
in
her
increasing
bloom
an
air
of
conscious
privilege
that
cleverly
corrected
by
pretty
charities
gave
distinction
to
her
had
yet
not
a
direct
influence
on
her
work
that
only
made
only
made
the
more
for
it
only
rounded
it
off
with
a
mystery
finer
and
subtler
chapter
xi
it
was
therefore
from
her
husband
i
could
never
remove
my
eyes
i
beset
him
in
a
manner
that
might
have
made
him
uneasy
i
went
even
so
far
as
to
engage
him
in
conversation
didn
t
he
know
hadn
t
he
come
into
it
as
a
matter
of
course
question
hummed
in
my
brain
of
course
he
knew
otherwise
he
wouldn
t
return
my
stare
so
queerly
his
wife
had
told
him
what
i
wanted
and
he
was
amiably
amused
at
my
impotence
he
didn
t
wasn
t
a
laugher
his
system
was
to
present
to
my
irritation
so
that
i
should
crudely
expose
myself
a
conversational
blank
as
vast
as
his
big
bare
brow
it
always
happened
that
i
turned
away
with
a
settled
conviction
from
these
unpeopled
expanses
which
seemed
to
complete
each
other
geographically
and
to
symbolise
together
drayton
deane
s
want
of
voice
want
of
form
he
simply
hadn
t
the
art
to
use
what
he
knew
he
literally
was
incompetent
to
take
up
the
duty
where
corvick
had
left
it
i
went
still
was
the
only
glimpse
of
happiness
i
had
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
duty
didn
t
appeal
to
him
he
wasn
t
interested
he
didn
t
care
yes
it
quite
comforted
me
to
believe
him
too
stupid
to
have
joy
of
the
thing
i
lacked
he
was
as
stupid
after
as
he
had
been
before
and
that
deepened
for
me
the
golden
glory
in
which
the
mystery
was
wrapped
i
had
of
course
none
the
less
to
recollect
that
his
wife
might
have
imposed
her
conditions
and
exactions
i
had
above
all
to
remind
myself
that
with
vereker
s
death
the
major
incentive
dropped
he
was
still
there
to
be
honoured
by
what
might
be
was
no
longer
there
to
give
it
his
sanction
who
alas
but
he
had
the
authority
two
children
were
born
to
the
pair
but
the
second
cost
the
mother
her
life
after
this
stroke
i
seemed
to
see
another
ghost
of
a
chance
i
jumped
at
it
in
thought
but
i
waited
a
certain
time
for
manners
and
at
last
my
opportunity
arrived
in
a
remunerative
way
his
wife
had
been
dead
a
year
when
i
met
drayton
deane
in
the
of
a
small
club
of
which
we
both
were
members
but
where
for
because
i
rarely
entered
hadn
t
seen
him
the
room
was
empty
and
the
occasion
propitious
i
deliberately
offered
him
to
have
done
with
the
matter
for
ever
that
advantage
for
which
i
felt
he
had
long
been
looking
as
an
older
acquaintance
of
your
late
wife
s
than
even
you
were
i
began
you
must
let
me
say
to
you
something
i
have
on
my
mind
i
shall
be
glad
to
make
any
terms
with
you
that
you
see
fit
to
name
for
the
information
she
must
have
had
from
george
information
you
know
that
had
come
to
him
poor
chap
in
one
of
the
happiest
hours
of
his
life
straight
from
hugh
he
looked
at
me
like
a
dim
phrenological
bust
the
vereker
s
secret
my
dear
general
intention
of
his
books
the
string
the
pearls
were
strung
on
the
buried
treasure
the
figure
in
the
he
began
to
numbers
on
his
bumps
to
come
out
vereker
s
books
had
a
general
intention
i
stared
in
my
turn
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
don
t
know
it
i
thought
for
a
moment
he
was
playing
with
me
mrs
deane
knew
it
she
had
it
as
i
say
straight
from
corvick
who
had
after
infinite
search
and
to
vereker
s
own
delight
found
the
very
mouth
of
the
cave
where
the
mouth
he
told
after
their
told
person
who
when
the
circumstances
were
reproduced
must
have
told
you
have
i
been
wrong
in
taking
for
granted
that
she
admitted
you
as
one
of
the
highest
privileges
of
the
relation
in
which
you
stood
to
her
to
the
knowledge
of
which
she
was
after
corvick
s
death
the
sole
depositary
all
i
know
is
that
that
knowledge
is
infinitely
precious
and
what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
that
if
you
ll
in
your
turn
admit
me
to
it
you
ll
do
me
a
kindness
for
which
i
shall
be
lastingly
he
had
turned
at
last
very
red
i
dare
say
he
had
begun
by
thinking
i
had
lost
my
wits
little
by
little
he
followed
me
on
my
own
side
i
stared
with
a
livelier
surprise
then
he
spoke
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
he
wasn
t
was
the
absurd
truth
she
tell
nothing
about
hugh
i
was
stupefied
the
room
went
round
it
had
been
too
good
even
for
that
upon
your
honour
upon
my
honour
what
the
devil
s
the
matter
with
you
he
growled
i
m
m
disappointed
i
wanted
to
get
it
out
of
it
isn
t
in
me
he
awkwardly
laughed
and
even
if
it
if
it
were
you
d
let
me
have
yes
in
common
humanity
but
i
believe
you
i
see
i
went
on
conscious
with
the
full
turn
of
the
wheel
of
my
great
delusion
my
false
view
of
the
poor
man
s
attitude
what
i
saw
though
i
couldn
t
say
it
was
that
his
wife
hadn
t
thought
him
worth
enlightening
this
struck
me
as
strange
for
a
woman
who
had
thought
him
worth
marrying
at
last
i
explained
it
by
the
reflexion
that
she
couldn
t
possibly
have
married
him
for
his
understanding
she
had
married
him
for
something
else
he
was
to
some
extent
enlightened
now
but
he
was
even
more
astonished
more
disconcerted
he
took
a
moment
to
compare
my
story
with
his
quickened
memories
the
result
of
his
meditation
was
his
presently
saying
with
a
good
deal
of
rather
feeble
form
this
is
the
first
i
hear
of
what
you
allude
to
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
as
to
drayton
deane
s
having
had
any
unmentioned
and
still
less
any
unmentionable
knowledge
of
hugh
vereker
she
d
certainly
have
wished
it
have
borne
on
his
literary
be
it
was
used
she
used
it
herself
she
told
me
with
her
own
lips
that
she
lived
on
i
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
i
repented
of
my
words
he
grew
so
pale
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
struck
him
ah
lived
he
murmured
turning
short
away
from
me
my
compunction
was
real
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
beg
you
to
forgive
ve
made
a
mistake
you
don
t
know
what
i
thought
you
knew
you
could
if
i
had
been
right
have
rendered
me
a
service
and
i
had
my
reasons
for
assuming
that
you
d
be
in
a
position
to
meet
your
reasons
he
asked
what
were
your
reasons
i
looked
at
him
well
i
hesitated
i
considered
come
and
sit
down
with
me
here
and
i
ll
tell
i
drew
him
to
a
sofa
i
lighted
another
cigar
and
beginning
with
the
anecdote
of
vereker
s
one
descent
from
the
clouds
i
recited
to
him
the
extraordinary
chain
of
accidents
that
had
in
spite
of
the
original
gleam
kept
me
till
that
hour
in
the
dark
i
told
him
in
a
word
just
what
i
ve
written
out
here
he
listened
with
deepening
attention
and
i
became
aware
to
my
surprise
by
his
ejaculations
by
his
questions
that
he
would
have
been
after
all
not
unworthy
to
be
trusted
by
his
wife
so
abrupt
an
experience
of
her
want
of
trust
had
now
a
disturbing
effect
on
him
but
i
saw
the
immediate
shock
throb
away
little
by
little
and
then
gather
again
into
waves
of
wonder
and
that
promised
i
could
perfectly
judge
to
break
in
the
end
with
the
fury
of
my
own
highest
tides
i
may
say
that
as
victims
of
unappeased
desire
there
isn
t
a
pin
to
choose
between
us
the
poor
man
s
state
is
almost
my
consolation
there
are
really
moments
when
i
feel
it
to
be
quite
my
revenge
