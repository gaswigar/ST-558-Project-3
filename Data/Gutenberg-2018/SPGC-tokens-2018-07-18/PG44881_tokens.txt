preface
as
nearly
twenty
years
have
elapsed
since
the
original
publication
of
this
work
a
revised
edition
might
but
for
the
present
absorbing
interest
of
indian
affairs
be
considered
unnecessary
on
its
first
appearance
received
as
an
exciting
romance
the
generality
of
readers
little
knew
how
much
of
melancholy
and
revolting
truth
lay
beneath
the
surface
at
the
present
time
it
may
deserve
a
more
attentive
study
recent
events
will
have
too
well
prepared
the
reader
mind
for
implicit
belief
in
all
the
systematic
atrocities
narrated
they
are
true
and
most
of
them
found
their
first
record
in
legal
and
official
documents
brought
under
the
notice
of
captain
taylor
who
from
an
early
age
possessed
the
rare
advantage
of
long
study
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
languages
manners
and
customs
of
the
natives
mahomedans
as
well
as
hindoo
in
fact
it
may
safely
be
affirmed
that
the
reader
will
find
no
characters
introduced
no
scenes
delineated
nor
customs
and
manners
of
the
east
described
which
have
not
been
faithfully
drawn
from
objects
with
which
the
writer
was
perfectly
familiar
it
will
scarcely
fail
to
be
remarked
with
what
consummate
art
such
numerous
bodies
of
men
were
organized
and
for
a
long
time
kept
absolutely
unknown
while
committing
acts
of
cruelty
and
rapine
hardly
conceivable
countenanced
too
and
secretly
supported
by
men
in
authority
and
even
by
priests
brahmins
and
fakeers
eager
to
share
in
their
unhallowed
gains
the
reader
is
particularly
requested
to
peruse
captain
introduction
as
affording
a
valuable
key
to
the
subsequent
narrative
it
may
also
furnish
some
clue
to
the
successful
concealment
of
a
rebellion
in
the
existence
of
which
many
of
our
oldest
and
most
experienced
officers
and
men
high
in
authority
absolutely
withheld
belief
till
too
late
and
too
cruelly
convinced
of
their
fatal
error
whatever
can
help
us
to
arrive
at
a
full
and
precise
knowledge
of
the
causes
and
the
extent
of
this
singular
conspiracy
which
must
have
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
our
eastern
empire
had
it
not
been
upheld
by
constancy
and
heroism
yet
more
extraordinary
is
of
the
utmost
value
and
merits
a
deeper
interest
and
more
serious
attention
than
any
romance
can
claim
introduction
the
tale
of
crime
which
forms
the
subject
of
the
following
pages
is
alas
almost
all
true
what
there
is
of
fiction
has
been
supplied
only
to
connect
the
events
and
make
the
adventures
of
ameer
ali
as
interesting
as
the
nature
of
his
horrible
profession
would
permit
me
i
became
acquainted
with
this
person
in
he
was
one
of
the
approvers
or
informers
who
were
sent
to
the
nizam
territories
from
saugor
and
whose
appalling
disclosures
caused
an
excitement
in
the
country
which
can
never
be
forgotten
i
have
listened
to
them
with
fearful
interest
such
as
i
can
scarcely
hope
to
excite
in
the
minds
of
my
readers
and
i
can
only
add
in
corroboration
of
the
ensuing
story
that
by
his
own
confessions
which
were
in
every
particular
confirmed
by
those
of
his
brother
informers
and
are
upon
official
record
he
had
been
directly
concerned
in
the
murder
of
seven
hundred
and
nineteen
persons
he
once
said
to
me
ah
sir
if
i
had
not
been
in
prison
twelve
years
the
number
would
have
been
a
thousand
how
the
system
of
thuggee
could
have
become
so
prevalent
unknown
to
and
unsuspected
by
the
people
of
india
among
whom
the
professors
of
it
were
living
in
constant
association
must
to
the
majority
of
the
english
public
not
conversant
with
the
peculiar
construction
of
oriental
society
be
a
subject
of
extreme
wonder
it
will
be
difficult
to
make
this
understood
within
my
present
limits
and
yet
it
is
so
necessary
that
i
can
not
pass
it
by
in
a
vast
continent
like
india
which
from
the
earliest
periods
has
been
portioned
out
into
territories
the
possessions
of
many
princes
and
chieftains
each
with
supreme
and
irresponsible
power
in
his
own
dominions
having
most
lax
and
inefficient
governments
and
at
enmity
with
or
jealous
of
all
his
neighbours
it
may
be
conceived
that
no
security
could
exist
for
the
traveller
upon
the
principal
roads
throughout
the
continent
no
general
league
was
ever
entered
into
for
his
security
nor
could
any
government
however
vigorous
or
system
of
police
however
vigilant
it
might
be
in
one
state
possibly
extend
to
all
when
it
is
also
considered
that
no
public
conveyances
have
ever
existed
in
india
the
want
of
roads
and
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
natives
being
alike
opposed
to
their
use
that
journeys
however
long
have
to
be
undertaken
on
foot
or
on
horseback
that
parties
previously
unknown
to
each
other
associate
together
for
mutual
security
and
companionship
that
even
the
principal
roads
except
those
constructed
for
military
purposes
by
the
company
government
are
only
tracks
made
by
the
constant
passage
of
people
over
them
often
intersecting
forests
jungles
and
mountainous
and
uncultivated
tracts
where
there
are
but
few
villages
and
a
scanty
population
and
that
there
are
never
any
habitations
between
the
different
villages
which
are
often
some
miles
apart
it
will
readily
be
allowed
that
every
temptation
and
opportunity
exists
for
plunderers
of
all
descriptions
to
make
travellers
their
prey
accordingly
freebooters
have
always
existed
under
many
denominations
employing
various
modes
of
operation
to
attain
their
ends
some
effecting
them
by
open
and
violent
attacks
with
weapons
others
by
petty
thefts
and
by
means
of
disguises
beyond
all
however
the
thugs
have
of
late
years
been
discovered
to
be
the
most
numerous
the
most
united
the
most
secret
in
their
horrible
work
and
consequently
the
most
dangerous
and
destructive
travellers
seldom
hold
any
communication
with
the
towns
through
which
they
pass
more
than
for
the
purchase
of
the
day
provisions
they
sometimes
enter
them
but
pitch
their
tents
or
lie
under
the
trees
which
surround
them
to
gain
any
intelligence
of
a
person
progress
from
village
to
village
is
therefore
almost
impossible
the
greatest
facilities
of
disguise
among
thieves
and
thugs
exist
in
the
endless
divisions
of
the
people
into
tribes
castes
and
professions
and
remittances
to
an
immense
amount
are
known
to
be
constantly
made
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
in
gold
and
silver
to
save
the
rate
of
exchange
jewels
also
and
precious
stones
are
often
sent
to
distant
parts
under
the
charge
of
persons
who
purposely
assume
a
mean
and
wretched
appearance
and
every
one
is
obliged
to
carry
money
upon
his
person
for
the
daily
expenses
of
travelling
it
is
also
next
to
impossible
to
conceal
anything
carried
from
the
unlimited
power
of
search
possessed
by
the
officers
of
customs
in
the
territories
of
native
princes
or
to
guard
against
the
information
their
subordinates
may
supply
to
thugs
or
robbers
of
any
description
it
has
been
ascertained
by
recent
investigation
that
in
every
part
of
india
many
of
the
hereditary
landholders
and
the
chief
officers
of
villages
have
had
private
connexion
with
thugs
for
generations
affording
them
facilities
for
murder
by
allowing
their
atrocious
acts
to
pass
with
impunity
and
sheltering
the
offenders
when
in
danger
whilst
in
return
for
these
services
they
received
portions
of
their
gains
or
laid
a
tax
upon
their
houses
which
the
thugs
cheerfully
paid
to
almost
every
village
and
at
towns
they
are
in
a
greater
proportion
several
hermits
fakeers
and
religious
mendicants
have
attached
themselves
the
huts
and
houses
of
these
people
which
are
outside
the
walls
and
always
surrounded
by
a
grove
or
a
garden
have
afforded
the
thugs
places
of
rendezvous
or
concealment
while
the
fakeers
under
their
sanctimonious
garb
have
enticed
travellers
to
their
gardens
by
the
apparently
disinterested
offers
of
shade
and
good
water
the
facilities
i
have
enumerated
and
hundreds
of
others
which
would
be
almost
unintelligible
by
description
but
which
are
intimately
connected
with
and
grow
out
of
the
habits
of
the
people
have
caused
thuggee
to
be
everywhere
spread
and
practised
throughout
india
the
origin
of
thuggee
is
entirely
lost
in
fable
and
obscurity
colonel
sleeman
conjectures
that
it
owed
its
existence
to
the
vagrant
tribes
of
mahomedans
which
continued
to
plunder
the
country
long
after
the
invasion
of
india
by
the
moghuls
and
tartars
the
hindoos
claim
for
it
a
divine
origin
in
their
goddess
bhowanee
and
certainly
the
fact
that
both
mahomedans
and
hindoos
believe
in
her
power
and
observe
hindee
ceremonies
would
go
far
to
prove
that
the
practice
of
thuggee
was
of
hindoo
origin
though
very
remote
traditions
of
it
exist
there
are
no
records
of
its
having
been
discovered
in
any
of
the
histories
of
india
until
the
reign
of
akbur
when
many
of
its
votaries
were
seized
and
put
to
death
from
that
time
till
although
native
princes
now
and
then
discovered
and
executed
the
perpetrators
i
believe
it
was
unknown
to
the
british
government
or
authorities
in
that
year
the
disappearance
of
many
men
of
the
army
proceeding
to
and
from
their
homes
induced
the
to
issue
an
order
warning
the
soldiers
against
thugs
in
after
the
murder
by
thugs
of
lieut
monsell
halhed
accompanied
by
a
strong
detachment
proceeded
to
the
village
where
the
murderers
were
known
to
reside
and
was
resisted
the
thugs
were
discovered
to
be
occupying
many
villages
in
the
pergunnahs
of
sindousé
and
to
have
paid
for
generations
large
sums
annually
to
sindia
government
for
protection
at
this
time
it
was
computed
that
upwards
of
nine
hundred
were
in
those
villages
alone
the
resistance
offered
by
the
thugs
to
halhed
detachment
caused
their
ultimate
dispersion
and
no
doubt
they
carried
the
practice
of
their
profession
into
distant
parts
of
the
country
where
perhaps
it
had
been
unknown
before
it
appears
strange
that
as
early
as
no
measures
for
the
suppression
of
thuggee
were
adopted
for
that
the
practices
of
the
thugs
were
well
known
we
have
the
strongest
evidence
in
a
paper
written
by
doctor
sherwood
which
appeared
in
the
literary
journal
of
madras
and
which
is
admirably
correct
in
the
description
of
the
ceremonies
and
practice
of
the
thugs
of
southern
india
one
would
suppose
that
they
were
then
considered
too
monstrous
for
belief
and
were
discredited
or
unnoticed
but
it
is
certain
that
from
that
time
up
to
in
almost
every
part
of
india
but
particularly
in
bundelkund
and
western
malwa
large
gangs
of
thugs
were
apprehended
by
major
borthwick
and
captains
wardlow
and
henley
many
were
tried
and
executed
for
the
murder
of
travellers
but
without
exciting
more
than
a
passing
share
of
public
attention
no
blow
was
ever
aimed
at
the
if
indeed
its
complete
and
extensive
organization
was
ever
suspected
or
if
suspected
believed
in
that
year
however
and
for
some
years
previously
thuggee
seemed
to
have
reached
a
fearful
height
of
audacity
and
the
government
could
no
longer
remain
indifferent
to
an
evil
of
such
enormous
and
increasing
magnitude
the
attention
of
several
distinguished
civil
officers
stockwell
smith
wilkinson
borthwick
and
others
had
become
attracted
with
great
interest
to
the
subject
some
of
the
thugs
who
had
been
seized
were
allowed
life
on
the
condition
of
denouncing
their
associates
and
among
others
feringhea
a
leader
of
great
notoriety
the
appalling
disclosures
of
this
man
so
utterly
unexpected
by
captain
now
colonel
sleeman
the
political
agent
in
the
provinces
bordering
upon
the
nerbudda
river
were
almost
discredited
by
that
able
officer
but
by
the
exhumation
in
the
very
grove
where
he
happened
to
be
encamped
of
no
less
than
thirteen
bodies
in
various
states
of
decay
and
the
offer
being
made
to
him
of
opening
other
graves
in
and
near
the
same
spot
the
approver
tale
was
too
surely
confirmed
his
information
was
acted
upon
and
large
gangs
which
had
assembled
in
rajpootana
for
the
purpose
of
going
out
on
thuggee
were
apprehended
and
brought
to
trial
from
this
period
the
system
for
the
suppression
of
thuggee
may
be
said
to
have
commenced
in
earnest
from
almost
every
gang
one
or
more
informers
were
admitted
and
when
they
found
that
their
only
chance
of
life
lay
in
giving
correct
information
they
unequivocally
denounced
their
associates
and
their
statements
were
confirmed
by
the
disinterment
of
their
victims
in
the
spots
pointed
out
in
this
manner
thuggee
was
found
to
be
in
active
practice
all
over
india
the
knowledge
of
its
existence
was
at
first
confined
to
the
central
provinces
but
as
men
were
apprehended
from
a
distance
they
gave
information
of
others
beyond
them
in
the
almost
daily
commission
of
murder
the
circle
gradually
widened
till
it
spread
over
the
whole
continent
and
from
the
foot
of
the
himalayas
to
cape
comorin
from
cutch
to
assam
there
was
hardly
a
province
in
the
whole
of
india
where
thuggee
had
not
been
practised
where
the
statements
of
the
informers
were
not
confirmed
by
the
disinterment
of
the
dead
few
who
were
in
india
at
that
period
will
ever
forget
the
excitement
which
the
discovery
occasioned
in
every
part
of
the
country
it
was
utterly
discredited
by
the
magistrates
of
many
districts
who
could
not
be
brought
to
believe
that
this
silently
destructive
system
could
have
worked
without
their
knowledge
i
quote
the
following
passage
from
colonel
sleeman
introduction
to
his
own
most
curious
and
able
work
while
i
was
in
civil
charge
of
the
district
of
nursingpoor
in
the
valley
of
the
nerbudda
in
the
years
and
no
ordinary
robbery
or
theft
could
be
committed
without
my
becoming
acquainted
with
it
nor
was
there
a
robber
or
thief
of
the
ordinary
kind
in
the
district
with
whose
character
i
had
not
become
acquainted
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
as
a
magistrate
and
if
any
man
had
then
told
me
that
a
gang
of
assassins
by
profession
resided
in
the
village
of
kundélee
not
four
hundred
yards
from
my
court
and
that
the
extensive
groves
of
the
village
of
mundésur
only
one
stage
from
me
on
the
road
to
saugor
and
bhopal
was
one
of
the
greatest
bhils
or
places
of
murder
in
all
india
that
large
gangs
from
hindostan
and
the
dukhun
used
to
rendezvous
in
these
groves
remain
in
them
for
days
together
every
year
and
carry
on
their
dreadful
trade
all
along
the
lines
of
road
that
pass
by
and
branch
off
from
them
with
the
knowledge
and
connivance
of
the
two
landholders
by
whose
ancestors
these
groves
had
been
planted
i
should
have
thought
him
a
fool
or
a
madman
and
yet
nothing
could
have
been
more
true
the
bodies
of
a
lie
buried
in
and
among
the
groves
of
mundésur
and
a
gang
of
assassins
lived
in
and
about
the
village
of
kundélee
while
i
was
magistrate
of
the
district
and
extended
their
depredations
to
the
cities
of
poona
and
hyderabad
similar
to
the
preceding
as
showing
the
daring
character
of
the
thuggee
operations
was
the
fact
that
at
the
cantonment
of
hingolee
the
leader
of
the
thugs
of
that
district
hurree
singh
was
a
respectable
merchant
of
the
place
one
with
whom
i
myself
in
common
with
many
others
have
had
dealings
on
one
occasion
he
applied
to
the
officer
in
civil
charge
of
the
district
captain
reynolds
for
a
pass
to
bring
some
from
bombay
which
he
knew
were
on
their
way
accompanied
by
their
owner
a
merchant
of
a
town
not
far
from
hingolee
he
murdered
this
person
his
attendants
and
brought
the
merchandise
up
to
hingolee
under
the
pass
he
had
obtained
and
sold
it
openly
in
the
cantonment
nor
would
this
have
ever
been
discovered
had
he
not
confessed
it
after
his
apprehension
and
gloried
in
it
as
a
good
joke
by
this
man
too
and
his
gang
many
persons
were
murdered
the
very
bazar
of
the
within
one
hundred
yards
of
the
main
guard
and
were
buried
hardly
five
hundred
yards
from
the
line
of
sentries
i
was
myself
present
at
the
opening
of
several
of
these
unblessed
graves
each
containing
several
bodies
which
were
pointed
out
by
the
approvers
one
by
one
in
the
coolest
manner
to
those
who
were
assembled
till
we
were
sickened
and
gave
up
further
search
in
disgust
the
place
was
the
dry
channel
of
a
small
watercourse
communicating
with
the
river
not
broader
or
deeper
than
a
ditch
it
was
close
to
the
road
to
a
neighbouring
village
one
of
the
main
outlets
from
the
cantonment
to
the
country
once
awakened
to
the
necessity
of
suppressing
by
the
most
vigorous
measures
the
dreadful
system
only
just
detected
in
its
operation
the
officers
who
were
first
appointed
to
investigate
the
reports
and
accusations
of
the
informers
used
their
utmost
efforts
to
arouse
in
the
supreme
government
a
corresponding
interest
and
happily
succeeded
the
matter
was
taken
up
most
warmly
by
the
lord
william
bentinck
and
the
supreme
council
and
highly
intelligent
officers
were
appointed
to
superintend
the
execution
of
measures
in
those
districts
where
thuggee
was
discovered
to
be
in
practice
most
of
the
native
princes
gave
up
claims
upon
such
of
their
subjects
as
should
be
apprehended
upon
charges
of
thuggee
or
who
should
be
denounced
by
the
informers
and
although
in
many
parts
the
landholders
and
potails
of
villages
protected
the
thugs
and
resisted
their
apprehension
yet
the
plans
for
the
suppression
of
the
system
were
eminently
successful
as
suspicion
was
aroused
no
body
of
men
could
traverse
the
country
in
any
direction
without
being
subject
to
the
strictest
scrutiny
by
the
police
and
by
informers
who
were
stationed
with
them
upon
all
the
great
thoroughfares
and
in
the
principal
towns
the
success
of
these
measures
will
be
more
evident
from
the
following
table
which
was
kindly
supplied
to
me
by
captain
reynolds
the
general
superintendent
of
the
department
from
to
inclusive
there
were
transported
to
penang
hanged
imprisoned
for
life
with
hard
labour
imprisoned
in
default
of
security
imprisoned
for
various
periods
released
after
trial
escaped
from
jail
died
in
jail
made
approvers
convicted
but
not
sentenced
in
jail
in
various
parts
not
yet
tried
added
to
the
above
captain
reynolds
mentioned
that
at
the
time
he
wrote
upwards
of
notorious
thugs
were
at
large
in
various
parts
of
india
whose
names
were
known
how
many
besides
existed
it
is
impossible
to
conjecture
how
enormous
therefore
must
have
been
the
destruction
of
human
life
and
property
in
india
before
thuggee
was
known
to
exist
or
was
only
partially
checked
how
many
thousands
must
annually
have
perished
by
the
hands
of
these
remorseless
assassins
awful
indeed
is
the
contemplation
for
during
the
whole
of
the
troublous
times
of
the
mahratta
and
pindharee
wars
their
trade
flourished
nor
was
it
till
that
their
wholesale
system
of
murder
received
any
serious
check
and
after
its
general
discovery
the
countless
and
affecting
applications
from
families
to
the
officers
of
the
department
to
endeavour
to
procure
them
some
knowledge
of
the
places
where
their
missing
relatives
had
been
destroyed
that
they
might
have
the
miserable
satisfaction
of
performing
the
ceremonies
for
the
dead
showed
how
deeply
the
evil
had
affected
society
and
not
only
as
described
in
the
following
pages
has
thuggee
existed
since
they
were
written
it
has
been
discovered
under
several
other
forms
and
been
found
to
be
extensively
practised
on
the
ganges
by
men
who
live
in
boats
and
murder
those
passengers
whom
they
are
able
to
entice
into
their
company
in
their
voyages
up
and
down
the
river
but
the
most
refined
in
guilt
are
those
who
murder
parents
for
the
sake
of
their
children
to
sell
them
as
household
slaves
or
to
dancing
women
to
be
brought
up
to
prostitution
throughout
the
whole
of
india
including
all
territories
of
native
princes
only
eighteen
officers
are
employed
as
superintendents
and
agents
for
the
suppression
of
thuggee
many
of
whom
besides
the
labour
of
this
office
which
is
excessive
have
other
civil
and
political
duties
to
fulfil
by
a
reference
to
any
map
it
will
at
once
be
seen
what
enormous
provinces
or
divisions
of
india
fall
to
the
superintendence
of
each
person
whether
it
is
possible
for
each
to
extend
to
every
part
of
that
under
his
charge
the
extreme
attention
and
scrutiny
which
are
so
imperatively
necessary
to
put
an
end
to
this
destructive
system
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
wherever
one
thug
exists
he
will
among
the
idle
and
dissolute
characters
which
everywhere
abound
in
the
indian
population
find
numbers
to
join
him
must
be
best
known
to
the
government
of
india
it
is
only
sincerely
to
be
hoped
that
considerations
do
not
prevent
the
appointment
of
others
if
necessary
the
confessions
i
have
recorded
are
not
published
to
gratify
a
morbid
taste
in
any
one
for
tales
of
horror
and
of
crime
they
were
written
to
expose
as
fully
as
i
was
able
the
practices
of
the
thugs
and
to
make
the
public
of
england
more
conversant
with
the
subject
than
they
can
be
at
present
notwithstanding
that
some
notice
has
been
attracted
to
the
subject
by
an
able
article
in
the
edinburgh
review
upon
colonel
sleeman
valuable
and
interesting
work
i
hope
however
that
the
form
of
the
present
work
may
be
found
more
attractive
and
more
generally
interesting
than
an
account
of
the
superstitions
and
customs
only
of
the
thugs
while
for
the
accuracy
of
the
pictures
of
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
natives
and
the
descriptions
of
places
and
scenes
i
can
only
pledge
the
experience
of
fifteen
years
residence
in
india
and
a
constant
and
intimate
association
with
its
inhabitants
if
this
volume
in
any
way
contribute
to
awaken
public
vigilance
in
the
suppression
of
thuggee
or
if
from
the
perusal
of
it
any
one
in
authority
rises
with
a
determination
to
lend
his
exertions
in
this
good
cause
of
humanity
my
time
will
not
have
been
occupied
in
vain
london
confessions
of
a
thug
chapter
i
you
ask
me
sahib
for
an
account
of
my
life
my
relation
of
it
will
be
understood
by
you
as
you
are
acquainted
with
the
peculiar
habits
of
my
countrymen
and
if
as
you
say
you
intend
it
for
the
information
of
your
own
i
have
no
hesitation
in
relating
the
whole
for
though
i
have
accepted
the
service
of
europeans
in
my
case
one
of
bondage
i
can
not
help
looking
back
with
pride
and
exultation
on
the
many
daring
feats
i
have
performed
often
indeed
does
my
spirit
rise
at
the
recollection
of
them
and
often
do
i
again
wish
myself
the
leader
of
a
band
of
gallant
spirits
such
as
once
obeyed
me
to
roam
with
them
wherever
my
inclination
or
the
hope
of
booty
prompted
but
the
time
is
past
life
sahib
is
dear
to
every
one
to
preserve
mine
which
was
forfeited
to
your
laws
i
have
bound
myself
to
your
service
by
the
fearful
tenure
of
denouncing
all
my
old
confederates
and
you
well
know
how
that
service
is
performed
by
me
of
all
the
members
of
my
band
and
of
those
with
whom
chance
has
even
casually
connected
me
but
few
now
remain
at
large
many
have
been
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
of
justice
and
of
those
who
now
wander
broken
and
pursued
from
haunt
to
haunt
you
have
such
intelligence
as
will
lead
to
their
speedy
apprehension
yet
thuggee
capable
of
exciting
the
mind
so
strongly
will
not
can
not
be
annihilated
look
at
the
hundreds
i
might
say
thousands
who
have
suffered
for
its
profession
does
the
number
of
your
prisoners
decrease
no
on
the
contrary
they
increase
and
from
every
thug
who
accepts
the
alternative
of
perpetual
imprisonment
to
dying
on
a
gallows
you
learn
of
others
whom
even
i
knew
not
of
and
of
thuggee
being
carried
on
in
parts
of
the
country
where
it
is
least
suspected
and
has
never
been
discovered
till
lately
it
is
indeed
too
true
ameer
ali
said
i
your
old
vocation
seems
to
be
as
flourishing
as
ever
but
it
can
not
last
men
will
get
tired
of
exposing
themselves
to
the
chance
of
being
hunted
down
like
wild
beasts
and
hanged
when
they
are
caught
or
what
is
perhaps
worse
to
many
of
being
sent
over
the
transported
and
so
heartily
does
the
government
pursue
thugs
wherever
they
are
known
to
exist
that
there
will
no
longer
be
a
spot
of
ground
in
india
where
your
profession
can
be
practised
you
err
sahib
you
know
not
the
high
and
stirring
excitement
of
a
thug
occupation
to
my
perception
it
appears
that
so
long
as
one
exists
he
will
gather
others
around
him
and
from
the
relation
of
what
i
will
tell
you
of
my
own
life
you
will
estimate
how
true
is
my
assertion
how
many
of
you
english
are
passionately
devoted
to
sporting
your
days
and
months
are
passed
in
its
excitement
a
tiger
a
panther
a
buffalo
or
a
hog
rouses
your
utmost
energies
for
its
destruction
you
even
risk
your
lives
in
its
pursuit
how
much
higher
game
is
a
thug
his
is
man
against
his
in
every
degree
from
infancy
to
old
age
he
has
sworn
relentless
unerring
destruction
ah
you
are
a
horrible
set
of
miscreants
said
i
i
have
indeed
the
experience
from
the
records
of
murders
which
are
daily
being
unfolded
to
me
of
knowing
this
at
least
of
you
but
you
must
begin
your
story
i
am
prepared
to
listen
to
details
worse
than
i
can
imagine
human
beings
to
have
ever
perpetrated
it
will
even
be
as
you
think
said
ameer
ali
and
i
will
conceal
nothing
of
course
you
wish
me
to
begin
my
tale
from
as
early
a
period
as
i
can
recollect
certainly
i
am
writing
your
life
for
the
information
of
those
in
england
who
would
no
doubt
like
to
have
every
particular
of
so
renowned
a
person
as
yourself
well
then
sahib
to
begin
the
earliest
remembrance
i
have
of
anything
and
until
a
few
years
ago
it
was
very
indistinct
is
of
a
village
in
the
territories
of
holkar
where
i
was
born
who
my
parents
were
i
know
not
i
suppose
them
to
have
been
respectable
from
the
circumstances
of
my
always
wearing
gold
and
silver
ornaments
and
having
servants
about
me
i
have
an
indistinct
recollection
of
a
tall
fair
lady
whom
i
used
to
call
mother
and
of
an
old
woman
who
always
attended
me
and
who
i
suppose
was
my
nurse
also
of
a
sister
who
was
younger
than
myself
but
of
whom
i
was
passionately
fond
i
can
remember
no
other
particulars
until
the
event
occurred
which
made
me
what
i
am
and
which
is
vividly
impressed
on
my
mind
from
an
unusual
bustle
in
the
house
and
the
packing
up
of
articles
of
clothing
and
other
necessaries
i
supposed
we
were
on
the
eve
of
departure
from
our
home
i
was
right
in
my
conjecture
for
we
left
it
the
next
morning
my
mother
and
myself
travelled
in
a
dooly
old
chumpa
was
mounted
on
my
pony
and
my
father
rode
his
large
horse
several
of
the
sons
of
our
neighbours
accompanied
us
they
were
all
armed
and
i
suppose
were
our
escort
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
after
we
left
our
village
after
our
march
of
the
day
we
as
usual
put
up
in
an
empty
shop
in
the
bazaar
of
the
town
we
rested
at
my
father
left
us
to
go
about
on
his
own
business
and
my
mother
who
could
not
show
herself
outside
after
repeated
injunctions
that
i
was
not
to
stray
away
lay
down
in
an
inner
room
and
went
to
sleep
finding
myself
at
liberty
as
chumpa
was
busy
cooking
and
the
juwans
were
all
out
of
the
way
i
speedily
forgot
all
my
mother
orders
and
betook
myself
to
play
with
some
other
children
in
the
street
we
were
all
at
high
romps
when
a
man
of
middle
age
addressed
me
and
asked
me
who
i
was
i
must
have
been
remarkable
from
the
rest
of
the
ragged
urchins
about
me
as
i
was
well
dressed
and
had
some
silver
and
gold
ornaments
on
my
person
i
told
him
that
my
father
name
was
yoosuf
khan
and
that
he
and
my
mother
and
myself
were
going
to
indoor
ah
then
said
he
you
are
the
party
i
met
yesterday
on
the
road
your
mother
rides
on
a
bullock
does
she
not
no
indeed
retorted
i
angrily
she
rides
in
a
palankeen
and
i
go
with
her
and
father
rides
a
large
horse
and
we
have
chumpa
and
several
juwans
with
us
do
you
think
a
pathan
like
my
father
would
let
my
mother
ride
on
a
bullock
like
the
wife
of
a
ploughman
well
my
fine
little
fellow
it
shall
be
as
you
say
and
you
shall
ride
a
large
horse
too
one
of
these
days
and
wear
a
sword
and
shield
like
me
but
would
you
not
like
some
sweetmeat
see
how
tempting
those
julabees
look
at
the
hulwaee
come
with
me
and
we
will
buy
some
the
temptation
was
too
strong
to
be
withstood
by
a
child
and
after
a
fearful
look
towards
the
shop
where
we
stayed
i
accompanied
the
man
to
the
hulwaee
he
bought
me
a
load
of
sweetmeats
and
told
me
to
go
home
and
eat
them
i
tied
them
up
in
a
handkerchief
i
wore
round
my
waist
and
proceeded
homewards
this
transaction
had
attracted
the
notice
of
some
of
the
ragged
urchins
i
had
been
playing
with
and
who
had
longingly
eyed
the
julabees
i
had
been
treated
to
and
as
soon
as
the
man
who
had
given
them
to
me
had
gone
a
short
distance
they
attacked
me
with
stones
and
dirt
till
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
seized
me
and
endeavoured
to
get
my
prize
from
me
i
struggled
and
fought
as
well
as
i
could
but
the
others
having
fairly
surrounded
me
i
was
mobbed
and
obliged
to
deliver
up
my
treasure
not
content
with
this
one
big
boy
made
a
snatch
at
the
necklace
i
wore
on
which
i
began
to
bellow
with
all
my
might
the
noise
i
made
attracted
the
notice
of
my
acquaintance
who
running
up
soon
put
the
troop
of
boys
to
flight
and
taking
me
under
his
charge
led
me
to
our
abode
where
he
delivered
me
up
to
chumpa
at
the
same
time
telling
her
of
the
scuffle
and
cautioning
her
not
to
let
me
out
of
her
sight
again
i
was
crying
bitterly
and
my
mother
hearing
a
strange
voice
called
me
to
her
asking
me
what
had
happened
i
told
my
story
and
said
that
the
person
who
had
saved
me
was
speaking
to
chumpa
she
addressed
him
from
behind
the
cloth
which
had
been
put
up
as
a
screen
and
thanked
him
and
added
that
my
father
was
absent
but
that
if
he
would
call
again
in
an
hour
or
two
he
would
find
him
at
home
and
she
was
sure
he
would
also
be
glad
to
thank
the
person
who
had
protected
his
child
the
man
said
he
would
come
in
the
evening
and
went
away
my
father
returned
soon
afterwards
and
i
received
an
admonition
in
the
shape
of
a
sound
beating
for
which
i
was
consoled
by
my
mother
by
a
quantity
of
the
sweetmeats
from
the
hulwaee
which
had
been
the
cause
of
my
trouble
and
i
may
add
also
of
my
present
condition
you
see
sahib
how
fate
works
its
ends
out
of
trifling
circumstances
towards
evening
my
acquaintance
accompanied
by
another
man
came
i
was
a
good
deal
the
subject
of
their
conversation
but
it
passed
on
to
other
matters
among
which
i
remember
the
word
thug
to
have
been
first
used
i
understood
too
from
their
discourse
that
there
were
many
on
the
road
between
where
we
were
and
indoor
and
that
they
were
cautioning
my
father
against
them
the
men
said
that
they
were
soldiers
who
had
been
sent
out
on
some
business
from
indoor
and
as
there
were
a
good
many
of
their
men
with
them
they
offered
to
make
part
of
our
escort
my
friend
was
very
kind
to
me
allowed
me
to
play
with
his
weapons
and
promised
me
a
ride
before
him
on
his
horse
the
next
day
i
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
and
with
him
for
his
kind
and
winning
manner
but
i
did
not
like
the
appearance
of
the
other
who
was
an
fellow
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
much
more
of
him
hereafter
we
started
the
next
morning
our
two
acquaintances
and
their
men
joined
us
at
a
outside
the
village
where
they
had
been
encamped
and
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
in
this
manner
we
travelled
for
two
days
and
my
friend
performed
his
promise
of
taking
me
up
before
him
on
his
horse
he
would
even
dismount
and
lead
him
allowing
me
to
remain
on
the
saddle
and
as
the
animal
was
a
quiet
one
i
used
to
enjoy
my
ride
till
the
sun
became
hot
when
i
was
put
into
the
dooly
with
my
mother
on
the
third
day
i
remember
my
friend
saying
to
my
father
as
they
rode
side
by
side
yoosuf
khan
why
should
you
take
those
poor
lads
of
yours
on
to
indoor
with
you
why
not
send
them
back
from
the
stage
we
are
now
approaching
i
and
my
men
are
ample
protection
to
you
and
as
you
will
belong
to
the
same
service
as
myself
there
can
be
no
harm
in
your
trusting
yourself
and
family
to
my
protection
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
besides
the
dangerous
part
of
the
road
the
jungle
in
which
we
have
been
for
the
last
two
days
is
passed
and
the
country
before
us
is
open
the
only
fear
of
thugs
and
thieves
existed
in
them
and
they
are
now
far
behind
it
is
well
said
replied
my
father
i
dare
say
the
lads
will
be
thankful
to
me
for
sparing
them
a
part
of
the
long
march
back
and
they
have
already
accompanied
us
some
fifty
or
sixty
coss
on
our
arrival
at
the
stage
my
father
told
the
lads
they
must
return
at
which
they
were
highly
pleased
and
on
their
departure
about
noon
i
gave
many
kind
messages
to
my
old
companions
and
playfellows
i
remember
too
giving
an
old
battered
rupee
to
be
delivered
to
my
little
sister
and
saying
she
was
to
hang
it
with
the
other
charms
and
coins
about
her
neck
to
remind
her
of
me
i
found
it
again
sahib
but
ah
under
what
circumstances
at
this
period
of
his
narrative
ameer
ali
seemed
to
shudder
a
strong
spasm
shot
through
his
frame
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
spoke
at
last
he
resumed
tell
a
servant
to
bring
me
some
water
sahib
i
am
thirsty
with
having
spoken
too
much
no
said
i
you
are
not
thirsty
but
you
shall
have
the
water
it
was
brought
but
he
scarcely
tasted
it
the
shudder
again
passed
through
him
he
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
his
irons
clanking
as
he
moved
it
was
horrible
to
see
the
workings
of
his
face
at
last
he
said
sahib
this
is
weakness
i
could
not
conceal
it
i
little
thought
i
should
have
been
thus
moved
at
so
early
a
period
of
my
story
but
recollections
crowded
on
me
so
fast
that
i
felt
confused
and
very
sick
it
is
over
now
i
will
proceed
do
so
said
i
the
juwans
had
been
gone
some
hours
and
it
was
now
evening
my
friend
came
to
our
abode
and
told
my
father
that
the
next
were
two
short
stages
and
if
he
liked
they
might
be
made
in
one
as
it
would
shorten
the
distance
to
indoor
but
that
we
should
be
obliged
to
start
very
early
long
before
daylight
and
that
the
bearers
who
carried
the
dooly
could
easily
be
persuaded
to
make
the
march
by
promise
of
a
sheep
which
the
potail
of
the
village
he
proposed
going
to
would
supply
free
of
cost
as
he
was
a
friend
of
his
my
father
seemed
to
be
rather
indignant
at
the
idea
of
his
taking
a
sheep
for
nothing
and
said
that
he
had
plenty
of
money
not
only
to
pay
for
a
sheep
but
to
give
them
a
present
if
they
carried
us
quickly
well
said
my
friend
so
much
the
better
for
we
sipahees
have
rarely
much
about
us
but
our
arms
true
returned
my
father
but
you
know
that
i
have
sold
all
my
property
at
my
village
and
have
brought
the
money
to
aid
me
in
our
service
indeed
it
is
a
good
round
sum
and
my
father
chuckled
at
the
idea
what
have
you
a
thousand
rupees
i
asked
my
ideas
of
wealth
going
no
further
and
what
if
it
should
be
more
said
he
and
the
matter
dropped
but
even
now
i
think
i
can
remember
that
my
friend
exchanged
significant
glances
with
his
companion
it
was
then
arranged
that
we
should
start
with
the
rising
of
the
moon
about
the
middle
of
the
night
we
were
roused
from
our
sleep
at
the
hour
proposed
and
after
the
men
had
had
a
pipe
all
round
we
set
off
i
was
in
the
dooly
with
my
mother
the
moon
had
risen
but
as
well
as
i
can
remember
there
was
but
little
light
and
a
slight
rain
falling
which
obliged
us
to
travel
very
slowly
after
we
had
proceeded
a
few
coss
the
bearers
of
the
dooly
put
it
down
saying
that
they
could
not
get
on
in
the
dark
and
the
mud
and
proposed
to
wait
till
daylight
my
father
had
a
violent
altercation
with
them
and
as
i
was
now
wide
awake
and
it
had
ceased
to
rain
i
begged
to
be
taken
out
of
the
dooly
and
allowed
to
ride
with
my
friend
he
did
not
assent
as
readily
as
usual
yet
he
took
me
up
when
the
bearers
had
been
scolded
into
going
on
i
remarked
to
him
that
some
of
the
soldiers
as
i
thought
them
were
absent
my
remark
attracted
my
father
notice
to
the
circumstance
and
he
asked
our
companion
where
they
were
he
replied
carelessly
that
they
were
gone
on
in
advance
as
we
had
travelled
as
yet
so
slowly
and
that
we
should
soon
overtake
them
we
proceeded
we
came
at
last
to
the
deep
bed
of
a
river
on
the
sides
of
which
there
was
some
thick
jungle
when
my
friend
dismounted
as
he
said
to
drink
water
and
told
me
the
horse
would
carry
me
over
safely
i
guided
him
on
as
well
as
i
could
but
before
i
had
got
well
across
the
stream
i
heard
a
cry
and
the
noise
as
if
of
a
sudden
scuffle
it
alarmed
me
and
in
looking
back
to
see
from
whence
it
proceeded
i
lost
my
balance
on
the
horse
and
fell
heavily
on
the
stones
in
the
bed
of
the
river
which
cut
my
forehead
severely
i
bear
the
mark
now
i
lay
for
a
short
time
and
raising
myself
up
saw
all
the
men
who
i
thought
were
far
on
before
us
engaged
in
plundering
the
dooly
i
now
began
to
scream
with
all
my
might
one
of
them
ran
up
to
me
and
i
saw
it
was
the
one
i
have
before
mentioned
ah
we
have
forgotten
you
you
little
devil
cried
he
and
throwing
a
handkerchief
round
my
neck
he
nearly
choked
me
another
man
came
up
hastily
it
was
my
friend
he
must
not
be
touched
he
cried
angrily
to
the
other
and
seized
his
hands
they
had
a
violent
quarrel
and
drew
their
swords
i
can
remember
no
more
for
i
was
so
much
frightened
that
i
lost
all
consciousness
and
as
i
suppose
fainted
i
was
recovered
by
some
water
being
forced
into
my
mouth
and
the
first
objects
which
met
my
eyes
were
the
bodies
of
my
father
and
mother
with
those
of
chumpa
and
the
all
lying
confusedly
on
the
ground
i
can
not
remember
what
my
feelings
were
but
they
must
have
been
horrible
i
only
recollect
throwing
myself
on
my
dead
mother
whose
face
appeared
dreadfully
distorted
and
again
relapsing
into
insensibility
even
after
the
lapse
of
years
the
hideous
appearance
of
my
mother
face
and
particularly
of
her
eyes
comes
to
my
recollection
but
i
need
not
describe
it
sahib
she
had
been
strangled
she
my
father
and
the
whole
party
had
come
to
a
miserable
and
untimely
end
i
heard
a
narrative
of
the
particulars
of
the
event
many
years
afterwards
from
an
old
thug
and
i
will
relate
them
in
their
proper
place
when
i
recovered
my
consciousness
i
found
myself
once
more
before
my
friend
who
had
saved
my
life
he
supported
and
almost
carried
me
in
his
arms
and
i
perceived
that
we
were
no
longer
on
the
road
we
were
rapidly
traversing
the
jungle
which
extended
as
far
as
i
could
see
in
every
direction
but
the
pain
of
my
neck
was
so
great
that
i
could
scarcely
hold
up
my
head
my
eyes
seemed
to
be
distended
and
bursting
and
were
also
very
painful
with
my
consciousness
the
remembrance
of
the
whole
scene
came
to
my
recollection
and
again
i
fell
into
insensibility
i
recovered
and
relapsed
in
this
manner
several
times
during
this
journey
but
it
was
only
momentary
only
sufficient
to
allow
me
to
observe
that
we
still
held
on
at
a
rapid
pace
as
the
men
on
foot
were
between
running
and
walking
at
last
we
stopped
and
it
was
now
broad
daylight
indeed
the
sun
had
risen
i
was
taken
off
the
horse
by
one
of
the
men
and
laid
under
a
tree
on
a
cloth
spread
on
the
ground
and
after
some
time
my
friend
came
to
me
desolate
as
i
was
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
must
have
had
some
concern
in
the
death
of
my
parents
and
in
my
childish
anger
i
bitterly
reproached
him
and
bade
him
kill
me
he
tried
to
console
me
but
the
more
he
endeavoured
the
more
i
persisted
that
he
should
put
me
to
death
i
was
in
dreadful
pain
my
neck
and
eyes
ached
insufferably
i
heaped
all
the
abuse
i
could
think
of
upon
him
and
the
noise
i
made
attracted
the
notice
of
the
man
whose
name
was
gunesha
what
is
that
brat
saying
are
you
too
turned
woman
cried
he
fiercely
addressing
the
other
whose
name
was
ismail
that
you
do
not
put
the
cloth
about
his
neck
and
quiet
him
at
once
let
me
do
it
if
you
are
afraid
and
he
approached
me
i
was
reckless
and
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
vile
abuse
and
spat
at
him
he
untied
his
waistband
and
was
about
to
put
an
end
to
me
when
ismail
again
interfered
and
saved
me
they
had
again
a
violent
quarrel
but
he
succeeded
in
carrying
me
off
to
some
little
distance
to
another
tree
where
some
of
the
band
were
preparing
to
cook
their
victuals
and
setting
me
down
among
them
bidding
them
take
care
of
me
he
went
away
the
men
tried
to
make
me
speak
but
i
was
sullen
and
would
not
the
pain
of
my
neck
and
eyes
seemed
to
increase
and
i
began
to
cry
bitterly
i
lay
in
this
manner
for
some
hours
i
suppose
and
at
last
completely
tired
out
fell
asleep
i
woke
towards
evening
and
when
ismail
saw
me
sit
up
he
came
to
me
soothed
and
caressed
me
saying
that
i
should
henceforth
be
his
child
and
that
it
was
not
he
but
others
who
had
murdered
my
parents
i
remember
begging
him
to
do
something
for
my
neck
which
was
swelled
and
still
very
painful
he
examined
it
and
seemed
to
be
struck
with
the
narrow
escape
i
had
had
of
my
life
he
rubbed
my
neck
with
oil
and
afterwards
put
upon
it
a
warm
plaster
of
leaves
which
relieved
it
greatly
and
i
felt
easier
for
its
application
he
remained
with
me
and
some
of
the
other
men
sitting
down
by
us
began
to
sing
and
play
to
amuse
me
i
was
given
some
milk
and
rice
to
eat
in
the
evening
but
before
it
was
time
to
sleep
ismail
brought
me
some
sherbet
of
sugar
and
water
which
he
said
would
make
me
sleep
i
suppose
there
was
opium
in
it
for
i
remember
nothing
till
the
next
morning
when
i
found
myself
in
his
arms
on
horseback
and
knew
that
we
were
again
travelling
i
pass
over
the
journey
as
i
remember
nothing
of
it
except
that
gunesha
was
no
longer
with
us
which
i
was
very
glad
of
for
i
hated
him
and
could
not
bear
his
presence
even
in
sahib
though
we
have
been
engaged
together
in
thuggee
i
always
bore
a
aversion
to
him
which
never
changed
to
the
last
ismail
and
seven
men
were
all
that
remained
of
the
band
and
we
proceeded
by
long
and
fatiguing
marches
to
a
village
in
which
he
said
he
resided
and
where
i
was
to
be
given
up
to
the
care
of
his
wife
we
arrived
at
last
and
i
was
introduced
to
a
young
woman
as
a
child
of
a
relation
whom
he
had
long
ago
adopted
as
a
son
and
had
now
brought
home
to
her
in
fine
i
was
formally
adopted
by
them
as
their
own
and
my
sufferings
were
speedily
forgotten
chapter
ii
i
must
have
been
at
this
time
about
five
years
old
it
will
strike
you
perhaps
as
strange
sahib
that
i
should
remember
so
many
particulars
of
the
event
i
have
described
but
when
i
was
imprisoned
some
years
ago
at
dehlie
i
used
to
endeavour
in
my
solitude
to
recollect
and
arrange
the
past
adventures
of
my
life
one
circumstance
led
me
to
the
remembrance
of
another
for
in
solitude
if
the
mind
seeks
the
occupation
it
readily
takes
up
the
clue
to
past
events
however
distant
and
thought
brings
them
one
by
one
before
the
imagination
as
vividly
fresh
as
the
occurrences
of
yesterday
and
from
an
old
adventures
which
i
heard
during
that
imprisonment
i
found
my
memory
to
serve
me
well
i
was
in
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
facts
as
i
have
related
them
to
you
and
i
have
only
perhaps
supplied
the
minor
points
from
my
own
mind
i
particularly
recollect
the
scene
with
gunesha
which
he
has
since
related
to
me
and
told
me
that
such
was
his
rage
at
the
abuse
i
poured
on
him
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
dread
of
ismail
vengeance
and
of
his
power
he
would
have
sacrificed
me
in
his
fury
but
to
return
to
my
story
if
you
are
not
tired
of
it
no
indeed
said
i
i
am
becoming
more
and
more
interested
in
it
well
resumed
ameer
ali
i
was
kindly
nursed
and
tended
by
ismail
and
his
wife
the
curiosity
of
the
villagers
was
a
good
deal
excited
by
my
appearance
and
i
have
since
suspected
ismail
thought
i
might
one
day
reveal
what
i
knew
of
my
origin
and
for
this
reason
i
was
never
allowed
out
of
his
or
his
wife
sight
i
must
then
however
have
speedily
forgotten
all
about
it
or
at
least
have
retained
so
confused
and
indistinct
a
recollection
of
the
circumstances
that
had
i
endeavoured
to
relate
them
to
any
one
i
could
not
have
made
them
intelligible
and
should
have
been
disregarded
ismail
in
his
village
carried
on
the
trade
of
a
at
least
when
he
was
at
home
he
daily
sat
in
his
shop
with
different
kinds
of
cloths
before
him
for
sale
but
it
was
plain
even
to
me
to
see
that
he
was
restless
and
uneasy
he
would
very
often
be
absent
for
days
together
without
his
family
knowing
where
he
had
gone
and
he
would
suddenly
return
with
large
quantities
of
cloth
and
other
goods
which
were
always
exposed
for
sale
i
continued
to
be
the
object
of
his
greatest
care
and
i
reciprocated
his
affection
for
indeed
i
was
more
kindly
treated
by
him
than
i
ever
had
been
by
my
father
who
was
a
proud
and
man
my
new
mother
too
never
gave
me
reason
to
be
displeased
with
her
for
having
no
child
of
her
own
i
was
her
pet
and
she
lavished
on
me
all
the
means
in
her
power
i
was
always
well
dressed
and
had
every
indulgence
that
a
child
could
wish
for
i
was
about
nine
years
old
i
think
when
my
kind
protectress
died
of
a
fever
while
ismail
was
on
one
of
his
excursions
and
i
was
taken
by
a
neighbour
to
his
house
until
he
returned
i
shall
never
forget
his
despair
when
he
found
his
home
desolate
young
as
i
was
i
could
do
but
little
to
console
him
but
he
used
to
go
and
deck
her
tomb
with
flowers
every
friday
and
bitter
were
his
lamentations
over
her
grave
poor
miriam
for
that
was
her
name
it
was
well
for
you
that
you
died
had
you
lived
what
would
now
have
been
your
condition
as
the
wife
of
a
noted
thug
your
reputation
would
have
been
blasted
and
you
would
have
become
an
outcast
sahib
she
never
knew
what
ismail
was
he
was
to
her
a
man
in
prosperous
circumstances
she
had
everything
she
could
desire
and
not
a
want
remained
unsatisfied
and
so
deeply
and
were
his
plans
that
she
would
never
have
known
till
the
day
of
his
capture
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
professed
murderer
i
pass
over
the
next
four
or
five
years
of
my
life
as
i
can
remember
no
incident
in
them
worth
relating
ismail
soon
after
the
death
of
his
wife
removed
from
the
village
where
he
had
hitherto
resided
and
took
up
his
abode
in
the
town
of
murnae
which
was
then
in
possession
and
i
was
put
to
school
with
an
old
man
who
taught
me
to
read
and
write
persian
as
i
grew
older
i
observed
that
ismail
used
very
frequently
to
have
a
number
of
men
at
his
house
by
night
and
i
was
naturally
curious
to
know
who
they
were
and
why
they
assembled
one
evening
that
i
knew
they
were
expected
i
feigned
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
as
usual
but
when
they
had
all
come
i
got
up
cautiously
and
hid
myself
behind
a
purdah
or
screen
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
where
they
sat
after
they
had
eaten
what
was
prepared
for
them
they
all
drew
together
and
began
conversing
in
a
language
i
only
partially
understood
and
i
thought
this
strange
as
i
knew
hindoostanee
and
the
common
dialect
myself
having
picked
up
the
latter
by
associating
with
the
boys
of
the
town
ismail
went
to
a
closet
very
near
where
i
lay
and
his
movement
alarmed
me
greatly
as
i
was
fearful
of
being
discovered
he
took
from
it
a
box
which
he
placed
in
the
circle
and
opened
it
rich
as
i
had
always
thought
him
i
had
no
idea
of
the
wealth
it
contained
there
were
quantities
of
gold
and
silver
ornaments
of
all
kinds
with
strings
of
pearls
and
other
valuables
they
seemed
all
parcelled
out
into
lots
as
equally
as
possible
and
to
each
man
he
gave
one
reserving
a
considerable
share
for
himself
at
last
they
began
to
speak
in
hindoostanee
a
language
i
understood
one
of
them
an
elderly
man
with
a
venerable
beard
said
to
ismail
what
do
you
intend
doing
with
ameer
he
is
almost
a
young
man
and
if
he
is
to
be
one
of
us
it
is
high
time
he
should
be
taught
what
to
do
it
is
very
dangerous
to
have
him
about
the
house
he
might
discover
something
and
be
off
before
you
knew
anything
of
the
matter
oh
i
have
no
fear
of
him
said
ismail
he
is
too
fond
of
me
besides
he
has
no
other
protector
in
the
world
but
myself
he
was
the
son
of
and
here
the
conversation
was
carried
on
by
ismail
again
in
the
language
i
did
not
understand
it
does
not
matter
said
another
man
whose
name
was
hoosein
and
whom
i
knew
very
well
as
he
was
employed
by
ismail
to
all
appearance
as
an
agent
for
selling
his
cloth
the
lad
is
a
smart
active
fellow
and
a
great
deal
too
knowing
for
you
to
let
him
go
about
everywhere
with
so
little
restraint
he
will
find
out
all
one
of
these
days
if
he
is
not
fairly
brought
among
us
besides
he
is
old
enough
to
be
of
use
in
many
ways
and
he
ought
to
be
instructed
in
our
profession
if
he
be
ever
to
learn
depend
upon
it
the
sooner
he
eats
the
goor
the
more
relish
he
will
have
for
it
i
brought
up
a
lad
myself
and
when
once
he
got
his
hand
in
he
was
a
perfect
tiger
at
the
work
and
became
so
expert
that
our
oldest
hands
could
hardly
compete
with
him
well
said
ismail
i
believe
you
are
right
and
i
foretell
great
doings
from
this
boy
he
is
brave
and
stout
beyond
his
years
and
there
are
but
few
who
can
excel
him
in
his
qusrut
which
i
have
taught
him
ever
since
he
was
a
child
but
he
is
of
so
kind
and
gentle
a
disposition
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
break
the
matter
to
him
i
almost
fear
he
will
never
consent
pooh
said
a
third
man
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
these
very
boys
are
the
best
we
could
have
they
are
the
more
easily
led
and
won
over
and
one
has
more
dependence
upon
them
put
the
matter
in
the
proper
light
talk
to
him
of
the
glory
of
the
business
and
of
our
surety
of
heaven
describe
to
him
all
about
the
houris
which
our
blessed
prophet
may
his
name
be
honoured
has
promised
us
and
tell
him
too
of
the
heaven
of
indur
all
of
which
you
know
we
are
sure
of
the
one
by
our
faith
as
moslims
and
the
other
by
our
profession
he
will
soon
be
won
over
i
am
certain
i
think
said
ismail
you
have
hit
on
the
right
way
the
lad
goes
to
the
old
foolish
moola
of
the
mosque
whenever
he
can
get
a
leisure
who
has
so
filled
his
head
with
stories
about
paradise
which
he
reads
to
him
out
of
the
blessed
koran
that
he
is
at
times
half
beside
himself
and
this
is
the
only
point
on
which
he
is
assailable
i
will
talk
him
over
and
have
no
doubt
he
will
soon
belong
to
us
the
sooner
the
better
said
hoosein
laughing
i
like
to
see
the
first
attempt
of
a
beginner
he
always
looks
so
confoundedly
innocent
when
the
cloth
is
put
into
his
hand
and
he
is
told
silence
cried
the
old
man
suppose
he
were
now
to
hear
you
and
you
were
going
on
with
a
relation
of
the
whole
matter
he
might
take
a
different
view
of
the
subject
and
be
off
as
i
said
before
no
there
is
no
fear
of
that
said
ismail
but
are
you
not
tired
with
your
march
remember
we
have
far
to
travel
and
by
alla
it
is
for
some
good
too
ay
said
all
getting
up
let
us
go
to
sleep
it
is
too
hot
to
rest
here
we
shall
be
cooler
in
the
open
air
and
they
left
the
room
you
may
believe
sahib
that
my
curiosity
was
at
the
highest
pitch
who
was
ismail
who
were
the
rest
what
was
it
i
was
to
know
or
to
be
taught
my
mind
was
in
a
whirl
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
i
never
closed
my
eyes
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
fever
so
intense
was
my
curiosity
and
i
may
say
my
desire
to
know
everything
and
to
become
a
partner
with
ismail
in
whatever
he
was
hitherto
i
had
been
looked
upon
treated
as
a
child
now
that
was
to
be
cast
aside
i
was
like
a
snake
to
throw
off
my
old
skin
and
to
appear
in
a
new
and
brighter
form
who
could
my
parents
be
i
had
gathered
enough
from
the
conversation
that
ismail
was
not
my
father
and
i
taxed
my
memory
to
recollect
such
portions
of
my
previous
existence
as
might
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
but
all
was
dark
within
me
i
could
remember
nothing
but
poor
miriam
my
mother
as
i
used
to
call
her
beyond
this
though
hard
did
i
endeavour
i
could
recollect
nothing
it
was
only
in
as
i
have
told
you
and
during
a
long
imprisonment
of
twelve
years
that
my
memory
aided
me
the
old
moola
of
the
mosque
had
hitherto
appeared
in
my
eyes
the
most
learned
of
men
he
had
stored
my
mind
with
passages
from
the
koran
which
had
made
me
an
enthusiast
when
he
spoke
to
me
of
the
glories
of
heaven
of
the
thousands
of
houris
who
would
be
at
the
command
of
every
true
believer
described
their
beautiful
forms
their
eyes
like
sapphires
their
teeth
of
pearls
their
lips
like
rubies
and
their
breath
like
the
perfume
of
musk
the
palaces
of
jewels
and
the
fountain
of
immortality
and
youth
i
believed
that
i
was
destined
to
enjoy
all
they
had
inflamed
my
imagination
and
as
i
used
to
repeat
them
to
ismail
he
too
appeared
as
delighted
as
i
was
and
used
to
regret
that
he
had
never
studied
the
blessed
book
that
he
might
enjoy
its
beautiful
descriptions
yet
the
moola
was
called
a
fool
by
hoosein
and
i
understood
from
him
that
theirs
was
a
higher
calling
their
rewards
more
splendid
than
even
those
of
the
moslim
what
could
they
be
i
burned
to
know
and
resolved
that
if
ismail
did
not
break
the
matter
to
me
i
would
of
my
own
accord
lead
him
to
the
subject
i
said
i
think
that
my
eyes
never
closed
that
night
when
i
rose
in
the
morning
i
found
that
ismail
and
the
others
were
gone
he
did
not
return
for
some
days
this
was
nothing
uncommon
certainly
but
his
proceedings
had
become
mysterious
to
me
for
a
long
time
before
and
i
could
not
help
connecting
his
frequent
and
long
absences
with
his
true
profession
whatever
that
might
be
he
could
not
be
a
there
was
nothing
in
that
plodding
business
to
hold
out
to
him
or
to
me
the
splendid
hopes
which
hoosein
and
the
rest
evidently
entertained
and
with
which
i
had
no
doubt
he
was
familiar
it
must
be
something
beyond
this
which
i
could
not
compass
and
to
see
whether
i
could
get
any
clue
to
it
i
betook
myself
to
the
old
moola
azeezoola
for
that
was
his
name
received
me
with
his
usual
kindness
but
remarked
that
i
must
be
ill
as
my
face
he
said
was
full
of
anxiety
and
as
though
i
was
suffering
from
fever
i
said
i
had
had
ague
but
that
i
was
better
and
that
it
would
soon
pass
from
me
i
took
my
usual
lessons
in
the
forms
positions
and
words
of
a
mahomedan
daily
prayers
and
when
these
were
ended
i
begged
him
to
open
the
koran
and
explain
again
to
me
my
favourite
passages
the
old
man
put
on
his
spectacles
and
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
read
to
me
passage
by
passage
of
the
book
in
arabic
explaining
the
meaning
to
me
as
he
read
it
was
the
same
i
had
heard
often
before
and
when
he
had
finished
i
asked
him
whether
there
were
not
other
portions
of
the
book
which
he
had
concealed
from
me
no
my
son
said
he
i
have
concealed
from
you
nothing
my
knowledge
of
this
blessed
book
is
indeed
very
limited
but
oh
that
you
could
have
seen
and
heard
the
commentaries
which
my
revered
preceptor
peace
be
to
his
memory
had
written
upon
it
in
them
so
deep
was
his
knowledge
that
every
sentence
of
some
chapters
in
which
the
true
meaning
is
purposely
hidden
from
the
uninspired
formed
a
separate
treatise
nay
in
some
passages
every
word
and
indeed
every
letter
was
commented
upon
but
he
is
gone
and
is
now
enjoying
the
delights
of
the
paradise
i
have
revealed
to
you
all
i
can
do
is
to
read
to
you
and
i
will
do
it
again
and
again
till
you
have
by
heart
the
parts
which
most
interest
you
and
which
are
the
cream
of
the
book
but
said
i
have
you
never
heard
of
anything
beyond
what
you
have
told
me
in
all
your
long
experience
you
are
surely
concealing
something
from
me
which
you
fear
to
tell
me
on
account
of
my
youth
no
indeed
said
the
old
man
it
is
true
that
some
professors
of
our
religion
sofees
and
others
whose
creeds
are
accursed
have
from
time
to
time
promulgated
heterodox
doctrines
which
are
plausible
enough
and
entrap
the
unwary
but
they
lead
to
ultimate
perdition
and
i
think
you
are
now
too
well
grounded
in
your
belief
to
be
led
away
by
them
young
as
you
are
thanks
to
your
kindness
i
am
said
i
and
it
was
only
to
try
whether
i
had
more
to
learn
that
i
have
now
questioned
you
as
i
have
for
i
saw
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
reveal
to
me
more
but
tell
me
father
what
profession
ought
i
to
adopt
to
carry
your
wise
instructions
into
the
best
effect
become
a
moola
said
he
you
will
have
to
undergo
much
painful
study
but
in
the
course
of
time
this
obstacle
will
be
overcome
and
depend
upon
it
there
is
no
station
or
profession
so
acceptable
to
god
as
that
of
one
of
his
ministers
i
will
instruct
you
in
the
rudiments
of
arabic
and
your
father
when
he
sees
your
mind
bent
upon
it
will
not
oppose
you
nay
he
will
send
you
to
delhie
to
complete
the
education
i
shall
have
begun
well
i
will
think
of
it
said
i
but
it
was
very
far
from
my
intention
to
become
a
moola
i
could
not
disguise
from
myself
that
azeezoola
was
miserably
poor
and
was
dependent
upon
contributions
he
with
difficulty
collected
for
his
maintenance
besides
ismail
was
not
a
moola
nor
hoosein
nor
any
of
their
set
and
i
must
become
one
of
them
be
they
what
they
might
before
my
mind
could
be
at
rest
i
went
no
more
to
him
i
had
got
from
him
his
little
store
of
knowledge
and
if
once
i
had
broken
the
subject
of
my
future
life
to
him
i
should
only
be
subjected
to
continual
arguments
in
support
of
his
view
of
what
would
tend
to
my
benefit
and
as
i
did
not
like
them
i
thought
it
better
to
stay
away
would
to
god
i
had
become
a
moola
anything
would
be
preferable
to
my
state
at
present
which
must
now
for
ever
remain
as
it
is
it
is
my
fate
however
and
i
ought
not
to
murmur
at
the
decrees
of
providence
if
it
had
not
been
written
would
my
father
have
been
murdered
if
it
had
not
been
written
should
i
have
ever
become
a
thug
assuredly
not
who
can
oppose
fate
who
can
avert
its
decrees
yet
would
you
not
sahib
release
me
and
provide
for
me
if
after
many
years
you
found
me
faithful
never
said
i
you
thugs
are
too
dangerous
ever
to
be
let
loose
again
upon
the
world
your
fingers
would
itch
to
strangle
the
first
man
you
met
and
before
long
we
should
hear
of
ameer
ali
jemadar
with
a
gang
of
forty
or
fifty
fellows
who
would
give
us
infinite
trouble
to
catch
would
it
not
be
so
i
believe
you
are
right
said
ameer
ali
laughing
in
spite
of
my
remorse
at
times
the
opportunities
would
be
too
tempting
for
me
to
let
them
pass
and
you
know
i
have
eaten
the
goor
and
can
not
change
i
am
better
as
i
am
for
if
you
caught
me
again
you
would
hang
me
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
we
should
ameer
ali
but
go
on
with
your
story
you
will
forget
what
your
train
of
thought
was
if
you
digress
in
this
manner
he
resumed
nearly
a
month
elapsed
and
after
this
weary
time
to
me
ismail
returned
accompanied
by
hoosein
my
father
for
so
i
shall
call
him
remarked
a
change
in
my
appearance
which
i
accounted
for
as
i
had
done
to
the
moola
and
he
seemed
satisfied
but
was
i
oh
no
i
was
consumed
by
my
burning
curiosity
to
know
all
that
was
hidden
from
me
i
could
not
sleep
at
nights
and
became
sullen
and
oppressed
with
thoughts
which
led
me
to
no
conclusions
at
one
time
i
had
formed
the
determination
to
leave
my
father
and
seek
my
fortune
and
had
actually
packed
up
a
few
of
my
clothes
and
a
little
money
i
had
and
resolved
to
leave
the
town
in
the
night
little
caring
where
my
fate
should
lead
me
but
when
the
time
came
the
sense
of
my
desolation
so
pressed
upon
me
that
i
abandoned
the
idea
and
remained
i
trusted
to
time
for
clearing
up
the
mystery
that
hung
over
me
but
at
the
same
time
determined
that
i
would
be
more
watchful
over
my
father
and
his
companions
than
i
had
ever
been
before
and
many
were
the
resolutions
i
made
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
nearest
my
heart
yet
even
when
opportunities
occurred
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
task
it
was
not
that
i
was
timid
naturally
i
was
brave
it
was
a
mysterious
consciousness
that
i
should
hear
something
whenever
i
should
hear
it
that
was
strange
nay
fearful
that
deterred
me
but
why
this
feeling
should
have
so
possessed
me
i
can
not
now
tell
yet
so
it
was
one
evening
ismail
sent
for
me
to
his
i
had
been
rarely
admitted
to
it
and
my
heart
beat
fearfully
with
a
presentiment
that
i
was
upon
the
crisis
of
my
ismail
too
seemed
to
me
to
be
disturbed
he
bade
me
sit
down
and
we
sat
silently
for
some
time
gazing
on
one
another
there
was
only
one
small
oil
light
burning
in
a
recess
of
the
wall
which
made
the
apartment
very
gloomy
and
this
trifling
circumstance
contributed
still
more
to
increase
the
morbid
feeling
within
me
i
believe
i
almost
gasped
for
breath
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
arose
threw
myself
at
his
feet
and
burst
into
a
passionate
fit
of
weeping
why
ameer
my
child
my
son
said
he
kindly
and
caressingly
what
is
this
what
has
troubled
you
has
some
fair
one
bewitched
you
have
you
got
into
any
difficulty
while
i
have
been
away
tell
me
my
boy
you
know
you
have
no
one
in
the
world
so
fond
of
you
as
your
father
and
alas
you
have
now
no
mother
when
my
feelings
gave
me
power
of
utterance
fearfully
i
repeated
to
him
what
i
had
heard
from
him
and
the
rest
on
the
memorable
night
i
have
before
related
when
i
had
finished
i
rose
up
and
with
a
throbbing
heart
said
i
have
erred
my
father
my
curiosity
a
curiosity
overcame
me
but
since
then
my
feelings
have
changed
why
i
know
not
i
am
no
longer
a
boy
for
i
feel
that
i
can
do
anything
and
only
implore
you
to
put
me
to
the
proof
and
i
folded
my
hands
on
my
breast
and
stood
silently
he
was
evidently
much
moved
dusk
as
it
was
i
could
see
his
face
working
with
emotions
and
under
expressions
new
to
me
at
last
he
broke
the
silence
which
had
become
to
me
insupportable
my
son
he
said
you
know
more
than
i
had
ever
intended
you
should
i
have
now
no
alternative
but
to
make
you
such
as
i
am
myself
and
my
knowledge
of
your
character
leads
me
to
anticipate
much
from
you
trust
me
only
trust
me
i
passionately
exclaimed
you
shall
never
have
cause
to
regret
it
i
believe
you
said
he
and
now
attend
well
to
what
i
shall
say
for
upon
it
your
future
existence
depends
there
can
be
no
hesitation
no
falling
back
on
the
world
when
once
you
know
all
you
will
have
to
undergo
a
trial
which
will
stretch
your
courage
to
its
utmost
will
you
go
through
with
it
dare
you
to
brave
it
i
dare
cried
i
for
i
was
reckless
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
thought
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
not
but
i
swear
to
you
that
in
three
days
at
the
farthest
i
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
i
was
disappointed
yet
full
of
hope
and
he
dismissed
me
to
my
repose
ismail
performed
his
promise
but
i
can
hardly
describe
to
you
sahib
the
effect
it
then
had
on
my
mind
shall
i
endeavour
to
relate
what
his
tale
was
i
only
hesitate
as
it
began
by
his
giving
me
a
sketch
of
his
life
which
i
fear
would
lead
me
from
my
own
story
yet
it
would
interest
you
greatly
i
doubt
not
that
it
would
ameer
ali
said
i
and
when
you
have
finished
your
own
adventures
you
can
return
to
it
you
are
right
sahib
i
will
omit
it
at
present
all
except
his
concluding
words
which
with
his
tale
of
wrong
endured
and
revenged
made
me
hate
the
world
and
cleave
to
thuggee
as
the
only
profession
and
brotherhood
in
which
i
could
hope
to
find
good
faith
existing
they
were
these
and
they
have
ever
been
indelibly
impressed
on
my
memory
thus
far
my
son
have
i
related
some
events
of
my
life
for
your
instruction
and
i
have
little
more
to
add
i
need
hardly
now
mention
that
i
am
a
thug
a
member
of
that
glorious
profession
which
has
been
transmitted
from
the
remotest
periods
to
the
few
selected
by
alla
for
his
unerring
purposes
in
it
the
hindoo
and
the
moslim
both
unite
as
brothers
among
them
bad
faith
is
never
known
a
sure
proof
that
our
calling
is
blessed
and
sanctioned
by
the
divine
authority
for
where
on
this
earth
my
son
will
you
find
true
faith
to
exist
except
among
us
i
see
none
in
all
my
dealings
with
the
world
in
it
each
man
is
incessantly
striving
to
outwit
and
deceive
his
neighbour
and
i
turn
from
its
heartlessness
to
our
truth
which
it
is
refreshing
to
my
soul
to
contemplate
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
among
us
all
are
animated
with
the
same
zeal
go
where
we
will
we
find
the
same
brotherhood
and
though
differing
perhaps
in
many
parts
in
customs
and
points
of
practice
yet
their
hearts
are
the
same
and
all
pursue
the
great
aim
and
end
of
thuggee
with
the
same
spirit
go
where
we
will
we
find
homes
open
to
us
and
a
welcome
greeting
among
tribes
even
of
whose
language
we
of
hindostan
are
ignorant
yet
their
signs
of
recognition
are
the
same
as
ours
and
you
need
but
to
be
thrown
among
them
as
i
have
been
to
experience
the
truth
of
my
assertions
could
this
be
without
the
aid
of
god
so
clashing
are
human
interests
and
so
depraved
is
the
social
state
of
our
country
that
i
own
no
such
feeling
could
exist
without
the
divine
will
some
repugnance
you
will
feel
at
the
practice
of
the
profession
at
first
but
it
is
soon
overcome
for
the
rewards
held
out
are
too
glorious
to
allow
us
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
means
we
use
to
attain
them
besides
it
is
fate
the
decree
of
the
blessed
alla
and
who
can
withstand
it
if
he
leads
us
into
the
undertaking
he
gives
us
firm
and
brave
hearts
a
determination
which
no
opposition
can
overcome
and
a
perseverance
which
never
yet
failed
to
accomplish
its
object
such
my
son
is
what
i
would
make
you
you
will
enter
on
your
calling
at
once
in
a
high
grade
under
my
auspices
a
grade
which
others
spend
years
of
exertion
to
attain
you
will
never
know
want
for
all
my
wealth
shall
be
shared
with
you
be
firm
be
courageous
be
subtle
be
faithful
more
you
need
not
these
are
the
highest
qualifications
of
a
thug
and
those
which
ensure
honour
and
respect
among
our
fraternity
and
lead
to
certain
success
and
high
rank
as
for
me
i
look
but
to
see
you
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
your
own
to
retire
and
in
quiet
pass
the
remainder
of
the
years
allotted
to
me
content
with
hearing
the
praise
which
will
be
bestowed
upon
ameer
ali
the
daring
and
enterprising
son
of
ismail
till
then
i
shall
be
your
guardian
and
instructor
chapter
iii
my
father
said
i
you
need
say
no
more
i
am
yours
do
as
you
will
with
me
long
ere
i
heard
this
history
from
you
i
had
overheard
a
conversation
between
hoosein
yourself
and
some
others
regarding
me
which
has
caused
me
great
unhappiness
for
i
feared
i
was
not
thought
worthy
of
your
confidence
and
it
weighed
heavily
upon
my
mind
that
was
in
fact
the
cause
of
the
sorrow
and
heaviness
you
have
remarked
and
i
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
throw
open
my
heart
to
you
and
to
implore
of
you
to
receive
me
among
you
i
am
no
longer
a
child
and
your
history
has
opened
to
me
new
feelings
which
are
at
present
too
vague
for
me
to
describe
but
i
long
to
win
fame
as
you
have
done
and
long
to
become
a
member
of
the
profession
in
which
you
describe
true
faith
and
brotherhood
alone
to
exist
as
yet
i
have
seen
nothing
of
the
false
world
and
assuredly
what
you
have
said
makes
me
still
less
inclined
to
follow
any
calling
which
would
lead
me
to
connection
with
it
heartless
and
depraved
i
have
heard
it
to
be
from
others
besides
yourself
and
i
feel
as
though
i
were
chosen
by
alla
to
win
renown
it
can
only
be
gained
by
treading
in
your
footsteps
and
behold
me
ready
to
follow
you
whithersoever
you
will
lead
me
i
have
no
friend
but
yourself
no
acquaintance
even
have
i
ever
formed
among
the
youths
of
the
village
for
when
i
saw
them
following
what
their
fathers
had
done
and
what
appeared
to
me
low
and
pitiful
pursuits
my
spirits
rose
against
them
and
i
have
cast
them
off
my
only
friend
is
the
old
moola
who
would
fain
persuade
me
to
become
one
like
himself
and
spend
my
days
reading
the
koran
but
there
is
nothing
stirring
in
his
profession
though
it
is
a
holy
one
and
it
consequently
holds
out
no
inducements
to
me
or
any
hope
of
gratifying
the
thirst
for
active
employment
which
is
consuming
me
i
have
wished
to
become
a
soldier
and
to
enter
one
of
the
bands
in
the
service
of
sindea
to
fight
against
the
unbelieving
feringhees
but
this
too
has
passed
away
and
now
i
desire
nothing
but
to
become
a
thug
and
follow
you
my
father
through
the
world
i
will
not
disappoint
you
my
thirst
for
fame
is
too
ardent
for
anything
but
death
to
quench
it
may
god
keep
it
far
from
you
said
ismail
with
feeling
you
are
the
only
solace
to
a
life
which
has
now
no
enjoyment
but
what
is
produced
by
the
development
of
your
thoughts
and
actions
i
know
my
son
you
will
not
disappoint
me
you
see
the
state
of
prosperity
i
am
blessed
with
but
you
little
know
the
power
i
have
my
authority
is
owned
by
every
thug
in
this
part
of
hindostan
and
a
week
notice
would
see
a
band
of
a
thousand
men
ready
to
obey
any
order
i
should
give
them
this
will
be
proved
to
you
in
a
few
days
at
the
festival
of
the
dasera
we
shall
all
assemble
at
least
as
many
as
will
be
requisite
for
the
opening
operations
of
the
year
which
will
be
undertaken
on
a
scale
of
unusual
greatness
for
we
have
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
confusion
at
present
produced
by
the
wars
of
holkar
and
sindea
with
the
feringhees
we
anticipate
much
work
and
a
stirring
season
and
the
men
are
impatient
for
employment
after
a
long
period
of
inactivity
i
will
take
you
to
sheopoor
which
we
have
decided
on
as
our
place
of
meeting
as
the
zemindar
is
friendly
to
us
and
assists
us
in
many
ways
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
associates
and
you
will
be
initiated
as
a
thug
in
the
usual
manner
thus
sahib
our
conversation
ended
the
night
had
passed
in
its
relation
and
i
went
to
rest
a
different
being
from
what
i
had
been
for
many
days
before
i
rose
and
found
all
my
former
energy
and
spirit
had
returned
to
me
and
whereas
a
few
days
before
i
went
about
like
a
maiden
i
now
held
up
my
head
threw
out
my
chest
and
felt
a
man
it
was
true
i
was
still
a
boy
i
was
only
eighteen
years
old
but
i
did
not
suffer
my
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
this
a
few
years
thought
i
and
inshalla
i
shall
be
somebody
to
prove
to
you
sahib
the
excitement
that
possessed
me
i
shall
relate
to
you
the
following
circumstance
i
might
have
joined
in
the
action
before
but
never
should
have
dreamed
of
doing
the
deed
of
daring
i
then
did
in
the
presence
too
of
men
who
were
soldiers
by
profession
but
who
hung
back
at
the
moment
of
danger
it
happened
a
day
or
two
after
the
conversation
with
my
father
which
i
have
related
that
a
tigress
with
a
cub
came
into
a
small
tract
of
jungle
which
lay
near
our
village
the
first
day
she
was
seen
she
killed
a
shepherd
the
second
day
another
man
who
had
gone
to
look
for
his
body
and
the
third
she
grievously
wounded
the
potail
of
the
village
a
man
who
was
held
in
universal
estimation
and
he
died
during
the
night
a
general
meeting
of
the
villagers
was
held
at
the
place
set
apart
for
deliberations
and
it
was
determined
that
all
the
active
men
should
proceed
in
a
body
and
attack
the
beast
in
her
lair
the
next
morning
we
all
assembled
before
daybreak
there
was
one
man
a
huge
and
bearded
pathan
who
volunteered
to
be
our
leader
he
was
literally
hardly
able
to
move
for
the
weapons
he
had
about
him
two
swords
were
in
his
belt
which
also
contained
an
assortment
of
daggers
of
various
sizes
and
shapes
a
long
straight
sword
hung
over
his
left
shoulder
the
point
of
which
nearly
touched
the
ground
he
had
also
a
shield
across
his
back
and
in
his
right
hand
a
matchlock
with
the
match
lighted
he
addressed
my
father
as
we
came
up
salaam
aleikoom
ismail
sahib
said
he
is
a
quiet
person
like
you
coming
out
with
us
and
the
sahib
zadah
too
yes
khan
replied
my
father
it
is
incumbent
on
all
good
men
to
do
their
utmost
in
a
case
of
need
like
this
who
knows
if
the
brute
is
not
killed
but
that
some
one
else
may
become
food
for
it
inshalla
said
the
khan
twisting
up
his
mustachios
and
surveying
himself
we
have
determined
that
the
brute
dies
many
a
tiger
has
fallen
from
a
shot
from
my
good
gun
and
what
is
this
brute
that
it
should
escape
may
its
sister
be
defiled
the
only
fear
is
that
it
will
not
stand
to
allow
us
to
prove
that
we
are
men
and
not
dogs
before
it
as
to
that
said
my
father
we
must
take
our
chance
but
say
khan
how
will
you
move
with
all
those
weapons
about
you
why
you
could
not
run
away
were
she
to
rush
out
run
away
cried
the
khan
are
our
beards
to
be
defiled
by
a
brute
what
are
you
thinking
on
this
morning
to
suppose
that
dildar
khan
ever
turned
from
anything
in
his
life
only
let
it
come
out
i
say
and
you
will
see
what
use
the
weapons
will
be
trust
to
me
to
finish
it
first
i
shall
shoot
it
with
my
matchlock
it
will
be
wounded
then
i
shall
advance
on
it
thus
said
he
drawing
the
long
sword
and
flourishing
it
at
the
same
time
twirling
round
and
round
and
leaping
in
every
possible
direction
there
said
he
quite
out
of
breath
there
would
not
that
have
finished
it
why
i
am
a
perfect
roostum
in
matters
of
this
kind
and
killing
a
tiger
is
only
child
play
to
dildar
khan
why
i
could
eat
one
tail
and
all
but
come
along
and
when
the
play
begins
let
no
one
come
in
dildar
khan
way
said
he
to
the
assembled
group
for
inshalla
i
mean
to
show
you
poor
ignorant
people
how
a
tiger
can
be
killed
by
a
single
man
i
know
the
khan
to
be
as
arrant
a
coward
as
ever
breathed
said
my
father
to
me
but
come
let
us
see
what
he
will
do
for
i
confess
i
am
anxious
to
behold
him
capering
before
the
tigress
by
alla
said
i
if
he
does
perform
such
antics
the
brute
will
dine
on
him
to
a
certainty
that
is
no
concern
of
ours
said
my
father
it
is
a
matter
of
destiny
but
i
would
venture
a
great
deal
he
never
goes
within
an
arrow
flight
of
him
we
all
set
out
headed
by
dildar
khan
who
still
flourished
his
long
sword
holding
his
matchlock
in
his
left
hand
now
and
then
smoothing
up
his
moustachios
which
grew
or
had
been
trained
to
stick
upwards
from
his
lips
and
reached
nearly
to
his
eyes
we
soon
reached
the
jungle
and
on
entering
it
i
thought
the
khan
showed
signs
of
fear
the
beast
can
be
but
a
panther
after
all
said
he
and
it
is
hardly
worth
the
while
of
dildar
khan
to
put
himself
to
trouble
see
boys
continued
he
to
some
of
us
i
will
wait
here
if
it
should
really
turn
out
to
be
a
tiger
you
can
let
me
know
and
i
will
come
and
kill
it
against
this
however
we
all
protested
and
declared
that
all
would
go
wrong
without
him
and
after
some
demur
he
again
proceeded
i
told
you
said
my
father
how
it
would
be
but
let
us
see
how
he
will
end
the
affair
we
went
on
till
some
bones
and
torn
clothes
and
the
head
of
one
of
the
unfortunate
men
who
had
been
killed
lying
near
a
bush
proved
very
plainly
that
the
animal
was
not
far
off
and
at
these
the
khan
showed
fresh
signs
of
fear
they
say
it
is
a
purrut
bagh
said
he
a
beast
into
whom
the
unsainted
soul
of
that
mad
fakeer
that
son
of
the
shitan
shah
yacoob
has
entered
and
that
it
is
proof
against
shot
why
should
we
risk
our
lives
in
contention
with
the
devil
nay
khan
said
a
young
lad
the
scamp
of
the
village
you
are
joking
who
ever
heard
of
a
purrut
bagh
that
was
a
female
besides
we
will
burn
the
beards
of
fifty
shah
yacoobs
peace
cried
the
khan
be
not
irreverent
do
we
not
all
know
that
purrut
baghs
can
be
created
mashalla
did
i
not
see
one
near
asseergurh
which
a
fakeer
had
made
and
turned
loose
on
the
country
because
they
would
not
supply
him
with
a
virgin
from
every
village
what
was
it
like
cried
a
dozen
of
us
and
for
a
moment
the
real
tigress
was
forgotten
like
said
the
khan
rubbing
up
his
mustachios
with
one
hand
and
pressing
down
his
waistband
with
the
other
like
why
it
had
a
head
twice
the
size
of
any
other
tiger
and
teeth
each
a
cubit
long
and
eyes
red
as
coals
which
looked
like
torches
at
night
and
it
had
no
tail
and
but
here
he
was
stopped
short
and
our
laughter
too
by
a
loud
roar
from
a
short
distance
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
tigress
and
a
cub
rushed
past
us
with
their
tails
in
the
air
well
khan
said
the
lad
that
is
no
purrut
bagh
at
any
rate
did
you
not
see
the
tail
of
the
big
one
how
she
shook
it
at
you
i
represent
said
he
that
tail
or
no
tail
it
holds
the
accursed
soul
of
that
wretch
yacoob
may
his
grave
be
defiled
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
is
useless
to
try
to
kill
the
shitan
if
he
chose
you
know
he
could
blow
us
all
into
hell
with
a
breath
namurd
namurd
coward
coward
cried
some
of
us
you
were
brave
in
the
village
how
are
you
now
who
calls
me
namurd
roared
the
khan
follow
me
and
see
if
i
am
one
or
not
and
he
rushed
forward
but
not
in
the
direction
the
tigress
had
gone
that
is
not
the
way
cried
some
and
at
last
he
turned
this
is
child
play
said
my
father
come
if
we
are
to
do
anything
we
had
better
set
about
it
in
good
earnest
and
we
went
on
in
the
direction
the
beast
had
taken
it
led
to
an
open
glade
at
one
side
of
which
there
was
a
large
rock
with
some
very
thick
bushes
about
it
she
is
there
depend
upon
it
said
an
old
hunter
i
never
saw
a
more
likely
place
in
my
life
we
were
all
about
thirty
steps
from
the
rock
and
bushes
and
dildar
khan
did
not
at
all
relish
his
proximity
to
them
i
beg
to
represent
said
he
in
a
low
voice
to
us
all
that
having
killed
so
many
of
these
brutes
i
know
best
how
to
manage
them
and
as
i
am
the
best
armed
of
the
party
i
shall
take
up
my
position
near
yonder
bush
by
which
runs
the
pathway
she
will
take
to
it
when
she
is
driven
out
and
then
you
will
see
the
reception
she
will
meet
with
from
dildar
khan
inshalla
i
shall
present
the
point
of
my
sword
to
her
and
she
will
run
on
it
then
i
shall
finish
her
with
one
blow
of
my
tegha
we
all
looked
in
the
direction
he
pointed
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
bush
about
two
hundred
paces
off
on
the
pathway
to
the
village
not
that
one
surely
said
my
father
why
man
you
will
never
see
the
beast
from
thence
trust
me
said
the
khan
and
off
he
went
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
continued
my
father
directly
he
sees
the
animal
he
will
be
off
down
the
road
as
fast
as
he
can
but
come
said
he
to
the
men
since
the
khan
thinks
he
will
be
of
more
use
down
yonder
i
will
lead
you
on
and
we
will
see
whether
this
eater
of
men
can
not
be
got
out
we
were
immediately
divided
into
three
parties
one
to
go
on
either
side
of
the
bushes
the
other
by
a
circuit
to
get
behind
the
rock
and
if
possible
upon
it
in
order
to
shoot
her
from
above
if
she
was
to
be
seen
if
not
at
any
rate
to
dislodge
her
by
throwing
stones
the
arrangements
were
quickly
completed
and
though
we
were
all
within
only
a
few
yards
of
the
bushes
there
was
no
sign
of
the
tigress
she
expressed
no
displeasure
at
our
near
approach
or
preparations
as
she
had
been
disturbed
before
and
of
course
could
not
easily
be
driven
out
of
her
place
of
refuge
i
was
with
one
of
the
parties
on
the
side
and
had
no
arms
but
a
sword
and
a
light
shield
indeed
i
had
gone
more
as
a
spectator
than
aught
else
we
waited
a
few
minutes
and
one
of
the
party
who
had
been
sent
round
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
rock
he
was
soon
followed
by
three
others
are
you
all
ready
cried
one
of
them
i
shall
heave
down
this
stone
bismilla
away
with
it
cried
my
father
three
of
them
applied
their
strength
to
it
and
at
last
it
rolled
over
the
face
of
the
rock
and
thundering
down
split
into
a
thousand
fragments
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
anxiety
and
suspense
but
no
tigress
followed
try
whether
you
can
not
see
her
cried
my
father
if
you
do
fire
we
are
all
prepared
the
men
looked
down
in
every
direction
but
said
nothing
at
last
one
of
them
was
observed
to
be
pointing
to
a
particular
spot
as
though
he
showed
the
others
something
by
alla
said
my
father
he
sees
her
look
out
she
will
rush
forth
before
you
are
thinking
of
her
every
man
blew
his
match
and
planted
his
feet
firmly
at
last
one
of
the
men
on
the
rock
raised
his
matchlock
and
fired
it
was
answered
by
a
tremendous
roar
which
rent
the
skies
and
out
rushed
the
cub
apparently
badly
wounded
for
before
he
had
come
a
few
yards
he
lay
down
and
roared
horribly
he
was
fully
and
made
a
dreadful
noise
one
of
the
men
of
our
party
fired
at
him
and
he
did
not
move
after
the
shot
struck
him
now
we
shall
have
tough
work
said
my
father
she
will
be
savage
and
infuriated
beyond
description
it
is
hardly
safe
to
be
here
but
mind
your
aim
my
lads
and
she
will
never
reach
us
i
never
yet
missed
mine
but
the
shot
may
not
be
fatal
so
look
out
for
yourselves
again
my
father
called
to
the
men
on
the
rock
to
heave
over
another
fragment
there
was
one
very
large
one
just
on
the
brink
after
a
good
many
pushes
it
gave
way
and
as
the
former
had
done
shivered
into
atoms
with
a
great
noise
it
was
successful
the
tigress
rushed
out
towards
our
side
and
stood
for
a
moment
i
had
never
seen
a
tiger
before
and
could
not
help
admiring
her
noble
appearance
there
she
stood
her
tail
erect
the
end
of
it
only
waving
from
side
to
side
glaring
on
us
with
her
fearfully
bright
eyes
apparently
irresolute
as
to
what
she
would
do
and
not
noticing
the
body
of
the
cub
which
was
close
to
her
we
were
all
as
silent
as
death
each
man
with
his
matchlock
to
his
shoulder
my
father
fired
and
then
the
others
i
could
see
the
whole
distinctly
for
i
had
no
gun
she
staggered
when
my
father
fired
he
had
evidently
hit
her
but
the
rest
had
missed
and
she
charged
with
another
tremendous
roar
right
at
our
party
but
the
shout
we
set
up
and
the
waving
of
our
weapons
turned
her
and
she
set
off
at
a
slow
canter
towards
the
bush
where
dildar
khan
had
stationed
himself
ya
alla
cried
my
father
coward
as
he
is
he
will
be
killed
she
will
spare
nothing
now
what
can
be
done
by
this
time
the
other
party
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
and
every
matchlock
was
discharged
she
must
have
been
hit
again
for
she
stopped
turned
round
growled
and
showed
her
teeth
but
again
sprang
forward
i
imagine
dildar
khan
had
no
idea
that
she
was
approaching
him
as
he
had
hid
himself
behind
the
bush
and
could
have
seen
nothing
of
what
had
passed
he
may
escape
said
my
father
it
is
possible
yet
scarcely
what
can
be
done
no
one
made
a
reply
but
an
instant
afterwards
i
had
drawn
my
sword
and
set
off
at
full
speed
after
the
enraged
brute
ameer
ali
my
son
come
back
come
back
instantly
ya
alla
he
too
will
perish
cried
my
father
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
but
i
heeded
not
and
who
of
that
company
had
my
fleet
foot
yet
some
of
them
followed
me
as
i
ran
i
saw
the
tigress
was
weak
and
was
badly
wounded
but
still
she
ran
fast
i
saw
her
approach
the
bush
and
the
miserable
man
dildar
khan
rush
from
behind
it
and
stand
in
her
very
path
with
his
arms
stretched
out
apparently
paralyzed
with
fear
another
instant
she
had
crouched
as
she
ran
and
sprang
upon
him
he
was
under
her
and
she
fiercely
tearing
his
body
it
did
not
stop
me
i
heard
the
cries
of
those
behind
me
to
turn
off
but
i
did
not
i
do
not
think
i
gave
the
danger
a
thought
if
i
did
the
excitement
overpowered
it
another
bound
had
brought
me
close
to
the
brute
whose
head
was
down
gnawing
the
body
beneath
her
i
made
but
one
stroke
at
her
which
praise
be
to
god
was
successful
the
blade
buried
itself
deep
in
the
back
of
her
neck
and
she
seemed
to
me
to
drop
dead
i
bounded
off
to
one
side
and
watched
for
a
moment
she
was
indeed
dead
and
lay
her
limbs
only
quivering
upon
the
body
of
the
man
beneath
her
unfortunate
coward
wounded
as
she
was
she
would
not
have
turned
after
him
had
he
even
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
avoid
her
but
he
had
thought
to
fly
and
the
sight
of
the
animal
had
paralyzed
his
faculties
though
all
passed
in
a
moment
methinks
now
sahib
i
see
him
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
and
his
arms
raised
and
expanded
as
though
wooing
the
animal
fatal
embrace
coward
had
he
remained
behind
the
bush
he
was
safe
and
might
have
shot
her
as
she
passed
but
there
he
lay
a
fearful
spectacle
his
face
all
bitten
and
lacerated
and
the
blood
pouring
from
wounds
in
his
stomach
he
was
quite
dead
my
father
came
up
immediately
he
embraced
me
and
burst
into
tears
how
could
you
risk
your
life
my
boy
said
he
how
could
you
be
so
rashly
venturous
of
your
life
for
so
poor
a
wretch
as
he
pointing
to
the
body
did
i
not
tell
you
he
was
a
coward
yet
i
am
proud
of
you
now
my
son
and
you
have
shamed
us
all
see
continued
he
to
the
whole
assembly
our
faces
are
blackened
this
day
by
a
boy
who
among
you
could
have
planted
so
and
deep
a
cut
see
the
blade
has
buried
itself
and
is
half
through
the
bone
mashalla
it
is
a
brave
boy
and
again
my
father
hugged
me
to
his
breast
i
beg
to
represent
said
old
benee
singh
my
instructor
in
my
athletic
exercises
that
some
of
the
praise
is
due
to
me
for
my
good
teaching
i
always
told
you
ismail
sahib
that
the
sahib
zadah
would
be
worthy
of
his
father
may
his
riches
increase
and
may
he
live
a
thousand
years
yes
sir
said
he
to
me
often
have
i
taught
you
that
cut
you
see
you
were
running
along
and
cut
over
your
left
hand
it
is
few
that
can
do
that
with
any
certainty
but
you
have
caught
the
knack
and
you
want
but
a
little
practice
to
become
as
good
a
swordsman
as
myself
perhaps
too
continued
he
to
me
laughing
the
heart
of
your
teacher
may
be
made
glad
under
such
an
auspicious
commencement
the
sahib
zadah
will
remember
the
old
rajpoot
that
reminds
me
said
my
father
that
i
owe
you
a
present
come
to
me
this
afternoon
inshalla
we
know
how
to
be
grateful
for
kindness
and
it
shall
have
its
reward
and
he
received
when
he
came
a
handsome
gift
i
must
say
however
that
under
his
tuition
i
had
become
highly
expert
at
all
manly
exercises
i
could
use
a
gun
throw
a
spear
wrestle
knew
the
exact
use
of
every
description
of
sword
straight
or
crooked
single
or
long
or
short
and
in
all
these
exercises
there
was
not
a
lad
of
the
village
and
i
may
say
of
the
country
round
who
could
in
any
way
compete
with
me
that
night
my
father
said
to
me
ameer
my
son
you
accompany
me
to
sheopoor
i
need
not
tell
you
how
exploit
will
raise
you
in
the
eyes
of
your
future
companions
already
have
i
despatched
intelligence
of
our
purposed
departure
and
some
account
of
affair
enough
only
to
make
them
curious
to
see
the
hero
of
it
and
i
have
mentioned
no
particulars
which
will
make
them
the
more
anxious
to
hear
them
from
me
you
have
hitherto
been
looked
on
with
some
suspicion
by
many
members
of
my
band
and
were
it
not
for
my
rank
of
jemadar
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
explain
my
intentions
in
regard
to
you
long
ago
to
them
i
look
therefore
upon
this
event
as
particularly
fortunate
as
knowing
you
are
to
be
publicly
brought
amongst
them
they
will
receive
you
with
greater
warmth
and
respect
as
having
given
so
undeniable
a
proof
of
your
bravery
in
the
presence
too
of
old
soldiers
who
have
most
of
them
seen
many
a
tough
fight
it
was
god
will
said
i
else
what
power
had
a
boy
like
i
to
do
such
a
thing
you
are
now
no
child
replied
my
father
you
have
this
day
or
i
mistake
you
much
thrown
off
every
lingering
feeling
of
boyhood
the
change
has
been
sudden
but
it
has
been
complete
and
it
will
last
or
i
mistake
you
much
you
do
not
i
replied
i
am
not
what
i
was
is
the
first
blood
i
have
seen
spilled
i
feel
that
it
will
not
be
the
last
chapter
iv
the
day
after
my
adventure
with
the
tiger
i
left
our
village
with
my
father
we
travelled
on
horseback
and
on
the
fourth
morning
afterwards
reached
sheopoor
the
town
from
which
the
grand
expedition
was
to
set
out
it
was
here
too
that
i
was
to
be
admitted
into
the
band
of
thugs
and
i
looked
forward
to
my
inauguration
with
much
impatience
and
perhaps
some
dread
for
i
knew
not
what
ceremonies
i
had
to
go
through
we
put
up
in
the
house
of
moedeen
where
several
other
thug
leaders
were
also
and
after
refreshing
ourselves
my
father
bade
me
accompany
him
to
the
council
which
was
to
determine
on
the
future
operations
i
was
presented
to
the
members
ten
in
number
who
were
the
jemadars
of
the
different
bands
i
could
see
from
the
respect
and
consideration
with
which
my
father
was
treated
that
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
chief
of
the
whole
i
was
gratified
by
the
reception
i
met
with
and
my
conduct
in
the
affair
of
the
tiger
the
whole
circumstances
of
which
were
related
by
my
father
raised
me
at
once
to
a
high
station
in
their
respect
as
it
still
wanted
two
days
of
the
festival
of
the
dasera
my
inauguration
was
postponed
to
that
day
for
it
is
esteemed
a
particularly
fortunate
one
by
the
thugs
and
indeed
by
all
classes
on
it
you
are
already
aware
that
all
great
undertakings
are
commenced
by
armies
and
in
like
manner
by
us
thugs
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
rains
gives
a
hope
that
the
adventure
will
not
be
impeded
by
them
and
the
continuance
of
fine
weather
which
follows
it
allows
the
band
to
travel
in
comfort
and
with
better
hope
of
booty
from
the
chance
of
falling
in
with
travellers
who
also
take
advantage
of
the
break
in
the
weather
to
commence
long
journeys
above
all
it
is
a
day
peculiarly
sacred
to
bhowanee
our
patroness
and
goddess
still
being
a
moosulman
i
could
not
then
see
why
such
respect
was
paid
to
the
festival
of
the
dasera
or
indeed
why
it
was
kept
at
all
and
i
applied
to
my
father
for
a
solution
of
my
doubts
on
the
subject
it
is
necessary
to
your
fully
understanding
this
said
he
that
i
should
give
you
an
outline
of
our
belief
in
the
divine
origin
of
our
profession
which
is
intimately
connected
with
the
faith
of
the
hindoos
and
by
whom
we
moosulmans
have
been
instructed
in
the
art
of
thuggee
this
is
wonderful
indeed
said
i
how
do
you
reconcile
any
connection
between
the
faith
of
unbelievers
and
that
of
the
blessed
prophet
i
can
not
pretend
to
solve
the
difficulty
said
my
father
but
as
their
religion
is
far
more
ancient
than
ours
and
no
doubt
had
a
divine
origin
there
are
many
points
in
it
which
one
of
the
true
faith
may
follow
without
offence
so
that
he
does
not
join
them
in
all
their
forms
and
professions
indeed
this
is
impossible
as
no
one
can
become
a
hindoo
but
as
i
told
you
before
thuggee
is
one
of
the
means
by
which
alla
works
out
his
own
ends
and
as
the
profession
of
it
has
been
handed
down
to
us
from
ages
and
as
it
becomes
the
fate
of
those
who
are
called
to
it
to
follow
it
there
is
no
possibility
of
avoiding
the
profession
though
one
desired
it
and
as
a
direct
consequence
no
sin
in
associating
with
hindoos
in
the
practice
of
it
from
whom
it
has
had
its
origin
do
you
understand
me
perfectly
said
i
it
was
not
to
question
its
propriety
that
i
asked
the
question
but
only
to
know
how
it
was
that
hindoo
festivals
were
acknowledged
and
kept
by
us
moosulmans
the
dasera
is
the
only
one
said
my
father
which
is
observed
and
the
reason
of
this
is
that
it
is
the
fittest
time
of
the
year
to
commence
our
enterprises
and
has
been
invariably
kept
sacred
by
all
hindoo
thugs
but
i
must
tell
you
of
the
origin
of
thuggee
that
you
may
judge
for
yourself
how
ancient
it
is
and
how
well
the
instructions
then
given
by
divine
command
have
been
followed
up
in
the
beginning
of
the
world
according
to
the
hindoos
there
existed
a
creating
and
a
destroying
power
both
emanations
from
the
supreme
being
these
were
as
a
matter
of
consequence
at
constant
enmity
with
each
other
and
still
continue
to
be
so
the
creative
power
however
peopled
the
earth
so
fast
that
the
destroyer
could
not
keep
pace
with
him
nor
was
he
allowed
to
do
so
but
was
given
permission
to
resort
to
every
means
he
could
devise
to
effect
his
objects
among
others
his
consort
devee
bhowanee
or
kalee
for
she
is
known
under
these
names
and
many
others
constructed
an
image
into
which
on
this
occasion
she
was
empowered
to
infuse
the
breath
of
life
no
sooner
was
this
effected
than
she
assembled
a
number
of
her
votaries
whom
she
named
thugs
she
instructed
them
in
the
art
of
thuggee
and
to
prove
its
efficacy
with
her
own
hands
destroyed
before
them
the
image
she
had
made
in
the
manner
which
we
now
practise
she
endowed
the
thugs
with
superior
intelligence
and
cunning
in
order
that
they
might
decoy
human
beings
to
destruction
and
sent
them
abroad
into
the
world
giving
them
as
the
reward
of
their
exertions
the
plunder
they
might
obtain
from
those
they
put
to
death
and
bidding
them
be
under
no
concern
for
the
disposal
of
the
bodies
as
she
would
herself
convey
them
from
the
earth
ages
passed
on
in
this
manner
and
she
protected
her
votaries
from
human
laws
and
they
were
everywhere
found
to
be
faithful
but
corruptions
crept
in
among
them
with
the
increased
depravity
of
the
world
and
at
last
a
gang
more
bold
and
curious
than
the
rest
after
destroying
a
traveller
determined
instead
of
following
the
old
custom
of
leaving
the
body
unnoticed
to
watch
and
see
how
it
was
disposed
of
they
hid
themselves
as
they
thought
secure
from
observation
in
the
bushes
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
waited
the
arrival
of
the
goddess
but
what
mortal
can
escape
the
eye
of
divinity
she
quickly
espied
them
and
called
them
before
her
by
her
splendid
and
terrific
appearance
and
in
the
utmost
dread
of
her
vengeance
they
attempted
to
fly
but
she
arrested
their
steps
and
in
an
awful
manner
upbraided
them
for
their
want
of
faith
have
seen
me
said
she
looked
upon
a
power
which
no
mortal
has
ever
yet
beheld
without
instant
destruction
but
this
i
spare
you
henceforward
however
i
shall
no
longer
protect
you
as
i
have
done
the
bodies
of
those
whom
you
destroy
will
no
longer
be
removed
by
me
and
you
must
take
your
own
measures
for
their
concealment
it
will
not
always
be
effectual
and
will
often
lead
to
your
detection
by
earthly
powers
and
in
this
will
consist
your
punishment
your
intelligence
and
cunning
still
remain
to
you
i
will
in
future
assist
you
by
omens
for
your
guidance
but
this
my
decree
will
be
your
curse
to
the
latest
period
of
the
world
so
saying
she
disappeared
and
left
them
to
the
consequences
of
their
own
folly
and
presumption
but
her
protection
has
never
been
withdrawn
it
is
true
the
remains
of
those
who
fall
by
our
hands
are
sometimes
discovered
and
instances
have
been
known
of
that
discovery
having
led
to
the
apprehension
of
thugs
at
least
so
i
have
heard
but
during
my
lifetime
i
have
never
known
of
one
and
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
such
instances
have
been
permitted
on
purpose
to
punish
those
who
have
in
some
way
offended
our
protectress
by
neglecting
her
sacrifices
and
omens
you
therefore
see
how
necessary
it
is
to
follow
the
rules
which
have
guided
our
fraternity
for
ages
and
which
can
not
be
changed
without
incurring
the
displeasure
of
the
divine
power
nor
is
there
anything
in
our
creed
to
forbid
it
we
follow
the
blessed
precepts
of
our
prophet
we
say
our
namaz
five
times
a
day
we
observe
all
the
rules
of
our
faith
we
worship
no
idols
and
if
what
we
have
done
for
ages
ever
since
the
invasion
by
our
forefathers
of
india
was
displeasing
to
the
apostle
surely
we
should
have
had
long
ere
this
some
manifestation
of
his
displeasure
our
plans
would
have
been
frustrated
our
exertions
rendered
of
no
avail
we
should
have
dragged
on
a
miserable
existence
and
long
ere
this
should
have
abandoned
thuggee
and
our
connection
with
its
hindoo
professors
i
am
convinced
said
i
for
your
relation
is
wonderful
truly
have
you
said
that
we
are
under
the
especial
protection
of
providence
and
it
would
be
sinful
to
question
the
propriety
of
any
usages
which
have
been
transmitted
from
a
period
so
remote
and
followed
without
deviation
i
will
allow
that
i
had
thought
this
open
connection
with
kafirs
as
offensive
because
i
was
led
to
believe
them
sunk
into
the
lowest
depths
of
depravity
and
bad
faith
from
the
representations
of
the
old
moola
who
was
my
instructor
but
he
must
have
been
ignorant
or
a
bigoted
old
fool
i
will
say
nothing
more
than
this
said
my
father
that
you
will
be
thrown
much
into
the
society
of
hindoos
all
of
good
caste
and
you
will
find
them
as
faithful
and
as
worthy
of
your
friendship
as
any
moosulman
such
at
least
has
been
my
experience
of
them
on
the
day
of
the
dasera
the
ceremony
of
my
inauguration
as
a
thug
commenced
i
was
bathed
and
dressed
in
new
clothes
which
had
never
been
bleached
and
led
by
the
hand
by
my
father
who
officiated
as
the
gooroo
or
spiritual
director
and
to
whom
seemed
to
be
confided
the
entire
direction
of
the
ceremonies
i
was
brought
into
a
room
where
the
leaders
of
the
band
i
had
before
seen
were
assembled
sitting
on
a
clean
white
cloth
which
was
spread
in
the
centre
of
the
apartment
my
father
then
advancing
towards
them
asked
them
whether
they
were
content
to
receive
me
as
a
thug
and
a
brother
to
which
they
all
answered
we
are
i
was
then
conducted
into
the
open
air
accompanied
by
the
whole
number
when
my
father
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
to
the
sky
cried
in
a
loud
voice
oh
bhowanee
mother
of
the
world
whose
votaries
we
are
receive
this
thy
servant
vouchsafe
to
him
thy
protection
to
us
an
omen
which
may
assure
us
of
thy
consent
we
waited
for
some
time
and
at
last
from
a
tree
over
our
heads
the
loud
twittering
of
the
small
was
heard
jey
bhowanee
victory
to
bhowanee
cried
the
whole
of
the
leaders
and
my
father
embraced
me
saying
be
of
good
cheer
my
son
the
omen
is
most
favourable
we
could
hardly
have
expected
such
an
one
thy
acceptation
is
complete
i
was
then
reconducted
to
the
apartment
and
a
pickaxe
that
holy
symbol
of
our
profession
was
placed
in
my
right
hand
upon
a
white
handkerchief
i
was
desired
to
raise
it
as
high
as
my
breast
and
an
oath
a
fearful
oath
was
then
dictated
to
me
which
i
repeated
raising
my
left
into
the
air
and
invoking
the
goddess
to
whose
service
i
was
devoting
myself
the
same
oath
was
repeated
by
me
on
the
blessed
koran
after
which
a
small
piece
of
consecrated
goor
or
coarse
sugar
was
given
me
to
eat
and
my
inauguration
was
complete
my
father
received
the
congratulations
of
the
assembly
on
the
fortunate
issue
of
the
ceremony
and
he
then
addressed
me
as
follows
my
son
thou
hast
taken
upon
thee
the
profession
which
is
of
all
the
most
ancient
and
acceptable
to
the
divinity
thou
hast
sworn
to
be
faithful
brave
and
secret
to
pursue
to
destruction
every
human
being
whom
chance
or
thy
ingenuity
may
throw
into
thy
power
with
the
exception
of
those
who
are
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
our
profession
which
are
now
to
thee
sacred
these
are
particular
sects
over
whom
our
power
does
not
extend
and
whose
sacrifice
is
not
acceptable
to
our
divine
patroness
they
are
dhobees
bhats
sikhs
nanukshahees
mudaree
fakeers
musicians
bhungees
tailees
lohars
burraes
and
maimed
or
leprous
persons
with
these
exceptions
the
whole
human
race
is
open
to
thy
destruction
and
thou
must
omit
no
possible
means
but
at
all
times
dependent
upon
the
omens
by
which
we
are
guided
to
compass
their
destruction
i
have
now
finished
you
are
become
a
thug
and
what
remains
of
thy
profession
will
be
shown
to
thee
by
our
gooroo
who
will
under
the
necessary
ceremonies
instruct
thee
in
its
details
it
is
enough
said
i
i
am
yours
to
death
and
i
only
pray
that
an
opportunity
may
soon
be
afforded
me
to
prove
to
you
my
devotion
thus
i
became
a
thug
had
i
commenced
my
career
under
other
and
ordinary
circumstances
i
mean
had
i
not
been
introduced
to
my
profession
by
one
so
powerful
and
well
esteemed
as
my
father
then
was
i
must
have
entered
the
lowest
grade
of
all
and
had
i
proved
myself
to
be
active
intelligent
and
brave
i
might
have
risen
in
time
to
the
highest
but
this
was
spared
me
and
though
too
young
myself
to
become
a
leader
i
was
in
a
rank
above
the
rest
and
was
considered
to
be
and
looked
up
to
as
the
person
who
was
hereafter
to
fill
my
father
place
whenever
it
should
suit
him
to
retire
from
active
employment
the
business
which
the
thug
leaders
had
assembled
to
deliberate
upon
was
a
plan
of
my
father
for
a
large
body
under
himself
and
two
other
leaders
one
of
whom
was
hoosein
to
take
the
high
road
to
the
dukhun
to
advance
together
as
far
as
nagpoor
from
whence
my
father
was
to
proceed
to
hyderabad
and
the
others
separating
one
to
go
to
aurungabad
thence
through
khândésh
by
boorhanpoor
to
indore
and
back
to
sheopoor
the
other
also
to
aurungabad
but
from
thence
to
poona
afterwards
if
possible
as
far
as
surat
and
from
thence
homewards
but
if
the
season
should
be
too
far
advanced
they
were
to
get
to
boorhanpoor
and
home
in
the
best
way
they
could
finally
we
were
all
to
meet
at
sheopoor
by
the
commencement
of
the
next
rainy
season
no
opposition
was
made
to
this
on
the
contrary
it
was
highly
approved
of
as
under
the
personal
direction
of
ismail
it
could
not
fail
of
success
and
as
an
expedition
had
not
been
made
to
the
dukhun
for
many
years
before
the
other
gangs
were
to
proceed
in
various
directions
about
hindostan
as
far
as
benares
and
round
through
the
saugor
and
nerbudda
country
their
proceedings
to
be
guided
by
circumstances
which
could
not
now
be
foreseen
thus
planned
but
a
few
days
elapsed
before
we
set
off
on
our
journey
with
us
there
were
sixty
men
with
hoosein
and
with
the
other
jemadar
whose
name
was
ghous
khan
thirty
making
in
all
one
hundred
and
before
we
commenced
our
journey
however
it
was
necessary
to
consult
the
omens
and
as
the
ceremonies
are
somewhat
curious
i
shall
relate
them
to
you
observing
that
no
expedition
whether
of
a
large
or
small
body
can
be
undertaken
without
them
the
morning
we
were
to
separate
on
our
different
destinations
everything
having
been
duly
prepared
we
repaired
to
a
spot
which
had
been
chosen
on
the
road
a
short
distance
from
the
village
and
the
whole
band
was
in
attendance
bhudrinath
a
man
of
much
intelligence
and
respectability
and
who
was
learned
in
the
conducting
of
ceremonies
bore
the
sacred
pickaxe
which
had
been
previously
duly
consecrated
and
was
immediately
attended
by
my
father
and
three
other
jemadars
my
father
as
the
leader
of
the
whole
carried
a
lota
filled
with
water
suspended
by
a
string
which
he
held
in
his
mouth
down
his
right
side
had
that
lota
fallen
what
a
dire
omen
would
it
have
been
to
him
nothing
could
have
averted
his
death
in
that
year
or
at
furthest
in
the
year
following
we
moved
slowly
till
we
reached
the
spot
fixed
on
and
there
my
father
stood
turning
his
face
to
the
south
the
direction
we
were
to
take
he
placed
his
left
hand
on
his
breast
reverently
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
pronounced
in
a
loud
voice
the
following
invocation
to
bhowanee
mother
of
the
universe
protectress
and
patroness
of
our
order
if
this
expedition
be
pleasing
to
thee
vouchsafe
us
thy
help
and
give
us
an
omen
of
thine
approbation
he
was
silent
and
every
mouth
repeated
the
prayer
aloud
now
every
one
looked
impatient
for
the
omens
the
band
scarcely
breathed
so
intensely
anxious
was
the
suspense
long
we
waited
perhaps
half
an
hour
no
one
spoke
and
the
reverent
silence
of
the
assembled
numbers
had
something
exceedingly
impressive
in
it
at
last
the
pilhaoo
or
omen
on
the
left
hand
was
vouchsafed
a
jackass
brayed
and
was
almost
instantly
answered
by
one
on
the
right
which
was
the
thibaoo
what
could
have
been
more
complete
such
an
omen
had
not
been
known
for
years
and
promised
the
utmost
success
and
splendid
booty
loud
and
fervent
were
the
cries
of
praise
to
bhowanee
and
each
turning
to
his
companion
congratulated
him
on
the
happy
prospect
seven
long
hours
my
father
sat
on
that
spot
during
which
time
all
was
prepared
for
the
journey
at
its
expiration
he
arose
and
we
took
the
nearest
road
to
guneshpoor
at
the
stage
where
we
stopped
for
the
evening
the
thibaoo
and
pilhaoo
were
heard
by
bhudrinath
who
carried
the
nishan
the
pickaxe
or
as
it
was
now
called
having
been
consecrated
and
these
renewed
favourable
omens
produced
an
increased
confidence
in
the
expedition
and
its
leaders
at
the
first
streamlet
we
passed
the
next
morning
the
band
all
sat
down
and
some
goor
and
dall
which
had
been
brought
with
us
was
shared
to
all
proceeding
favourable
omens
were
again
seen
and
all
declared
that
we
should
speedily
gain
a
rich
booty
to
me
this
was
all
strange
and
unaccountable
but
the
implicit
faith
which
every
one
seemed
to
place
in
the
omens
and
the
regularity
with
which
the
ceremonies
were
conducted
impressed
me
with
a
strong
idea
of
their
necessity
though
to
my
shame
i
say
it
as
i
acquired
confidence
in
myself
i
scorned
them
as
foolish
until
misfortune
no
doubt
sent
by
bhowanee
brought
me
to
my
senses
and
made
me
penitent
in
a
few
days
we
arrived
at
guneshpoor
and
as
yet
we
had
no
adventure
on
reaching
the
town
the
sothaees
or
inveiglers
whose
duty
it
is
to
entice
travellers
into
the
power
of
the
thugs
were
sent
into
the
town
while
we
remained
under
a
on
the
outside
they
were
absent
most
part
of
the
day
and
when
they
returned
they
were
eagerly
questioned
for
intelligence
the
men
who
had
been
sent
on
this
duty
were
two
hindoos
one
by
name
bhudrinath
whom
i
have
mentioned
before
a
brahmin
and
the
other
a
man
of
inferior
caste
by
name
gopal
but
both
were
persons
of
the
most
bland
and
persuasive
manners
and
i
was
told
that
they
rarely
failed
in
their
object
i
was
among
the
rest
highly
curious
to
hear
their
adventures
in
the
town
and
joined
my
father
on
his
taking
his
place
in
the
assembly
bhudrinath
told
us
that
he
had
gone
through
the
whole
of
the
bazar
without
success
when
he
was
attracted
to
a
bunnea
shop
by
a
respectable
old
man
who
was
in
high
dispute
with
the
bunnea
he
went
up
to
him
and
the
old
gentleman
who
was
in
a
violent
passion
at
some
attempted
exaction
on
the
part
of
the
merchant
immediately
accosted
him
and
begged
him
to
be
witness
to
the
transaction
expressing
at
the
same
time
his
intention
of
having
the
man
brought
before
the
kotwal
for
his
dishonesty
the
bunnea
was
very
insolent
and
abusive
bhudrinath
went
on
to
say
and
after
some
altercation
i
contrived
to
settle
the
matter
by
dint
of
threats
and
persuasions
the
old
man
seemed
highly
pleased
with
me
and
it
naturally
led
after
we
left
the
shop
together
to
a
conversation
about
whither
i
was
going
and
who
i
was
i
took
advantage
of
this
to
convince
him
that
the
town
was
no
safe
residence
for
a
traveller
even
for
a
night
and
discovered
that
he
was
a
persian
mootsuddee
or
writer
in
the
service
of
the
rajah
of
nagpoor
whither
he
was
travelling
with
his
son
i
of
course
alarmed
him
as
much
as
i
could
with
accounts
of
the
thieves
and
thugs
on
the
road
and
represented
ourselves
to
be
a
company
of
travellers
proceeding
also
to
nagpoor
on
our
way
to
the
dukhun
and
associated
together
for
mutual
protection
and
that
we
always
rested
outside
the
villages
as
being
the
safest
places
when
our
number
was
so
large
he
seemed
so
struck
with
the
proposal
i
made
to
him
to
come
out
and
join
us
that
i
lost
no
time
in
pressing
him
to
leave
the
town
and
i
have
succeeded
i
have
left
gopal
who
joined
us
to
show
him
the
way
out
and
assist
him
in
packing
up
his
things
and
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
be
here
before
sunset
barik
alla
exclaimed
my
father
your
face
is
bright
in
our
eyes
bhudrinath
and
i
have
no
doubt
lads
said
he
to
the
knot
of
listeners
that
the
old
khayet
has
abundance
of
money
and
jewels
and
his
plunder
will
help
to
see
us
on
to
nagpoor
so
if
he
does
not
come
to
us
of
his
own
free
will
we
must
even
waylay
him
and
that
too
in
the
next
march
a
short
time
will
decide
this
and
if
he
does
not
come
some
of
you
lughaees
must
be
off
to
prepare
the
bhil
or
place
of
burial
but
we
were
saved
the
trouble
for
the
khayet
came
into
our
camp
as
he
had
said
by
sunset
and
was
met
at
the
confines
of
it
by
my
father
and
the
two
other
jemadars
the
respectability
of
his
appearance
struck
me
forcibly
he
was
evidently
a
man
of
polished
manners
and
had
seen
courts
and
good
society
after
arranging
his
to
sleep
in
by
placing
some
tent
walls
around
it
for
protection
to
his
women
he
and
his
son
an
intelligent
youth
came
to
the
spot
where
my
father
and
the
other
leaders
had
spread
their
carpets
and
many
of
the
band
being
assembled
there
ensued
a
general
conversation
who
could
have
told
sahib
the
intentions
of
those
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
to
me
it
was
wonderful
i
knew
he
was
to
die
that
night
for
that
had
been
determined
when
he
arrived
in
our
camp
and
while
he
was
arranging
his
i
knew
too
that
a
spot
had
been
fixed
on
for
his
grave
and
that
of
those
with
him
for
i
had
accompanied
my
father
to
it
and
saw
that
it
was
begun
and
yet
there
sat
my
father
and
hoosein
and
ghous
khan
and
many
others
the
pipe
and
the
story
passed
round
and
the
old
man
was
delighted
at
the
company
he
had
fallen
into
i
thank
you
said
he
to
bhudrinath
that
you
brought
me
out
of
that
unsainted
village
truly
here
is
some
enjoyment
in
the
society
of
gentlemen
who
have
seen
the
world
there
i
should
have
been
in
perpetual
dread
of
robbers
and
should
not
have
slept
a
wink
all
night
while
here
i
need
not
even
to
be
watchful
since
i
am
assured
by
the
khan
sahib
pointing
to
my
father
that
i
shall
be
well
taken
care
of
ay
growled
out
in
a
whisper
an
old
thug
who
sat
behind
me
he
will
be
well
taken
care
of
sure
enough
i
will
see
to
that
how
said
i
he
gave
the
sign
by
which
i
knew
him
to
be
one
of
the
bhuttotes
or
stranglers
who
had
been
selected
i
have
an
old
grudge
against
him
he
continued
and
the
time
is
come
when
i
can
repay
it
tell
me
how
it
happened
said
i
in
a
low
tone
for
the
man
face
wore
a
savage
expression
as
he
said
it
not
now
said
he
how
can
i
i
will
tell
you
night
when
we
meet
in
the
mujlis
that
man
is
brij
lall
as
great
a
rascal
as
ever
lived
one
who
has
committed
more
murders
and
more
villanies
in
his
life
than
any
of
us
thugs
but
his
cup
is
full
his
breath
is
already
in
his
mouth
one
squeeze
from
me
and
it
will
go
forth
never
to
return
and
the
boy
said
i
that
fair
fine
boy
surely
he
will
be
spared
to
tell
all
he
saw
i
suppose
said
the
man
to
deliver
us
up
at
the
first
place
we
come
to
no
no
mea
we
know
better
and
so
will
you
one
of
these
days
and
he
went
round
and
seated
himself
just
behind
the
old
man
who
turned
about
as
though
he
were
intruded
upon
sit
still
sit
still
said
my
father
it
is
only
a
companion
in
an
open
camp
like
this
every
one
is
privileged
to
hear
the
conversation
of
the
evening
mujlis
and
we
usually
find
some
one
among
us
who
can
enliven
the
evening
with
a
tale
until
it
is
time
to
rest
for
the
night
so
the
old
thug
sat
still
i
could
see
him
playing
with
his
fatal
weapon
the
handkerchief
now
pulling
it
through
one
hand
and
now
through
the
other
and
i
gazed
on
the
group
till
my
brain
reeled
again
with
excitement
with
intense
agony
i
might
call
it
with
more
truth
there
sat
the
old
man
beside
him
his
boy
behind
them
their
destroyers
only
awaiting
the
signal
and
the
old
man
looked
so
unconscious
of
danger
was
so
entirely
put
off
his
guard
and
led
into
conversation
by
the
mild
bland
manners
of
my
father
that
what
could
he
have
suspected
that
he
was
in
the
hands
of
those
from
whom
he
was
to
meet
his
death
ah
no
and
as
i
gazed
and
gazed
how
i
longed
to
scream
out
to
him
to
fly
had
i
not
known
that
my
own
death
would
have
followed
instantaneously
i
had
done
it
yet
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
i
turned
away
my
eyes
from
them
but
they
returned
to
the
same
place
involuntarily
every
movement
of
the
men
behind
seemed
the
prelude
to
the
fatal
ending
at
last
i
could
bear
the
intensity
of
my
feelings
no
longer
i
got
up
and
was
hurrying
away
when
my
father
followed
me
where
are
you
going
said
he
i
insist
on
your
staying
here
this
is
your
initiation
you
must
see
it
and
go
through
with
the
whole
i
shall
return
directly
said
i
i
go
but
a
pace
or
two
i
am
sick
said
he
in
a
low
tone
see
you
do
not
stay
long
this
farce
must
soon
end
a
turn
or
two
apart
from
the
assembly
restored
me
again
and
i
returned
and
took
up
my
former
place
exactly
opposite
the
old
man
and
his
son
ya
alla
sahib
even
now
i
think
they
are
and
the
thug
pointed
with
his
finger
father
and
son
and
the
son
large
eyes
are
looking
into
mine
as
my
gaze
is
riveted
on
them
ameer
ali
looked
indeed
as
though
he
saw
them
and
stared
wildly
but
passing
his
hands
across
his
eyes
he
resumed
taajoob
said
he
wonderful
i
could
have
sworn
they
both
looked
at
me
but
i
am
growing
old
and
foolish
well
sahib
as
i
said
i
gazed
and
gazed
at
them
so
that
i
wonder
even
now
they
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
and
did
not
remark
it
but
no
the
old
man
continued
a
relation
of
some
treaties
the
nagpoor
rajah
was
forming
with
the
english
and
was
blaming
him
for
entering
into
any
league
with
them
against
his
brethren
when
my
father
called
out
tumbako
lao
bring
tobacco
it
was
the
signal
quicker
than
thought
the
thug
had
thrown
his
handkerchief
round
the
neck
of
the
old
man
another
one
his
round
that
of
the
son
and
in
an
instant
they
were
on
their
backs
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
not
a
sound
escaped
them
but
an
indistinct
gurgling
in
their
throats
and
as
the
bhuttotes
quitted
their
fatal
hold
after
a
few
moments
others
who
had
been
waiting
for
the
purpose
took
up
the
bodies
and
bore
them
away
to
the
grave
now
for
the
rest
cried
my
father
in
a
low
tone
some
of
you
rush
on
the
servants
see
that
no
noise
is
made
the
and
others
can
be
dealt
with
easily
some
of
the
men
ran
to
the
place
the
had
chosen
and
surrounded
the
unsuspecting
and
the
other
servants
who
were
cooking
under
a
tree
i
saw
and
heard
a
scuffle
but
they
also
were
all
dead
ere
they
could
cry
out
come
said
my
father
and
hoosein
taking
me
by
the
arms
and
hurrying
me
along
come
and
see
how
they
are
disposed
of
i
went
or
was
rather
dragged
along
to
one
side
of
our
encampment
where
there
was
a
ravine
some
feet
deep
in
the
bottom
of
which
a
hole
had
been
dug
and
by
the
side
of
which
eight
bodies
were
lying
the
father
and
son
his
two
wives
the
two
male
servants
and
an
old
woman
also
a
servant
who
was
in
the
inclosure
with
the
women
the
bodies
were
nearly
naked
and
presented
a
ghastly
spectacle
as
they
lay
in
a
confused
heap
but
just
visible
from
the
brink
of
the
ravine
are
they
all
here
asked
my
father
yes
khodawund
said
one
of
the
lughaees
whom
i
knew
then
in
with
them
cried
my
father
and
they
were
quickly
deposited
in
their
last
the
head
of
one
over
the
feet
of
another
so
that
they
might
lie
close
we
had
better
open
them
said
the
lugha
for
the
ground
is
loose
and
they
will
swell
so
gashes
were
made
in
their
abdomens
and
the
earth
quickly
filled
in
on
them
it
was
stamped
down
the
top
smoothed
and
in
a
few
moments
no
one
could
have
discovered
that
eight
human
beings
had
been
secreted
beneath
the
spot
we
turned
away
from
it
and
every
one
betook
himself
to
repose
sahib
can
i
describe
to
you
how
i
passed
that
night
do
what
i
would
the
father
and
son
appeared
before
me
the
old
man
voice
rung
in
my
ears
and
the
son
large
eyes
seemed
to
be
fixed
on
mine
i
felt
as
though
a
thousand
shitans
sat
on
my
breast
and
sleep
would
not
come
to
my
eyes
it
appeared
so
so
unprovoked
a
deed
that
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
in
any
way
to
have
become
even
a
silent
spectator
of
it
yet
my
father
had
joined
in
it
my
father
whom
i
loved
intensely
and
hoosein
too
but
all
would
not
do
i
could
not
tranquillize
myself
i
crept
from
beneath
our
little
tent
and
sat
down
in
the
open
air
the
moon
shone
brightly
as
ever
as
now
and
then
she
emerged
from
beneath
a
passing
cloud
and
there
was
a
cool
breeze
which
fanned
my
burning
face
and
soothed
me
i
watched
her
as
she
appeared
to
travel
along
in
the
heavens
till
she
became
overcast
and
a
few
heavy
drops
of
rain
as
if
she
wept
over
the
deed
she
had
witnessed
drove
me
again
under
the
tent
i
crept
close
to
my
father
who
was
sound
asleep
and
embracing
him
with
my
arms
sleep
came
to
my
eyelids
and
i
woke
not
till
the
usual
hour
of
prayer
arrived
when
i
was
roused
by
my
father
to
join
in
the
morning
supplication
we
spread
our
carpets
and
i
repeated
the
form
with
him
but
my
thoughts
were
with
the
old
man
and
his
son
and
the
event
of
the
preceding
night
immediately
after
it
was
over
our
horses
were
saddled
and
we
set
out
on
what
proved
to
be
a
long
march
for
it
was
necessary
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
guneshpoor
that
no
suspicion
might
attach
to
us
in
due
time
we
arrived
at
the
stage
and
a
man
was
sent
into
the
town
to
purchase
one
rupee
and
a
quarter
worth
of
goor
or
coarse
sugar
what
this
was
intended
for
i
could
not
imagine
but
it
was
soon
made
known
to
me
when
i
asked
my
father
this
said
he
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
tupounee
in
which
we
all
join
after
any
adventure
similar
to
what
you
saw
last
night
it
is
a
rite
of
the
utmost
solemnity
and
must
never
be
neglected
the
man
returned
with
the
sugar
and
a
place
having
been
chosen
bhudrinath
the
bearer
of
the
khussee
was
seated
on
a
blanket
spread
for
him
his
face
towards
the
west
all
the
best
men
and
noted
bhuttotes
seated
themselves
on
each
side
of
him
looking
in
the
same
direction
as
he
did
my
father
then
made
a
small
hole
in
the
ground
near
the
blanket
upon
which
was
placed
the
sacred
pickaxe
and
the
pile
of
sugar
and
a
piece
of
silver
as
an
offering
a
little
of
the
sugar
was
then
put
into
the
hole
by
my
father
he
raised
his
clasped
hands
to
heaven
and
in
a
supplicatory
manner
cried
aloud
powerful
and
mighty
goddess
who
hast
for
ages
vouchsafed
thy
protection
unto
thy
votaries
and
who
particularly
to
joora
naig
and
khudeek
bunwaree
gavest
one
lakh
and
sixty
thousand
rupees
in
their
need
we
beseech
thee
in
like
manner
to
aid
us
and
fulfil
our
desires
this
prayer
was
devoutly
repeated
by
all
around
and
my
father
taking
water
in
his
hand
sprinkled
it
upon
the
pickaxe
and
into
the
hole
he
then
took
pieces
of
the
sugar
and
presented
them
to
each
of
the
thugs
in
succession
who
ate
it
in
silence
they
then
drank
some
water
and
the
pile
of
sugar
was
distributed
among
the
rest
of
the
assembled
band
who
likewise
ate
their
portions
in
silent
reverence
all
except
myself
for
not
having
as
yet
strangled
a
man
i
was
not
eligible
to
partake
of
it
with
the
rest
however
my
father
had
reserved
a
portion
of
his
own
for
me
which
he
made
me
eat
after
i
had
swallowed
it
he
said
you
have
eaten
the
goor
and
are
now
a
thug
in
your
heart
were
you
to
desire
to
forsake
us
you
could
not
such
is
the
power
it
has
when
consecrated
as
you
have
seen
it
over
the
hearts
of
men
were
any
one
to
find
a
portion
and
eat
it
whatever
might
be
his
rank
or
condition
in
life
he
would
assuredly
become
a
thug
he
could
not
avoid
it
the
power
it
would
exercise
over
him
would
be
irresistible
this
is
wonderful
indeed
said
i
have
such
things
been
known
i
could
relate
hundreds
of
instances
had
i
time
he
replied
but
ask
hoosein
or
any
one
they
will
all
tell
you
the
same
in
the
evening
when
all
were
assembled
as
usual
my
father
took
me
to
task
about
my
as
he
termed
it
this
will
never
do
my
son
said
he
you
who
ran
in
upon
the
tiger
so
nobly
ought
not
to
shrink
from
such
as
this
you
must
be
a
man
and
behave
better
and
remember
you
have
eaten
the
goor
for
shame
brother
said
hoosein
do
not
speak
so
to
the
remember
you
were
no
better
yourself
at
first
do
you
not
recollect
the
business
at
and
what
difficulty
i
had
to
persuade
gunesha
that
you
were
in
reality
good
stuff
let
the
but
see
one
or
two
more
of
these
affairs
and
he
will
be
quite
a
different
person
he
will
become
a
tiger
at
the
work
i
do
not
fear
my
son
said
he
turning
to
me
and
slapping
me
on
the
back
worse
men
than
you
have
begun
better
and
ended
in
being
fellows
only
fit
to
dig
graves
and
be
scouts
old
hoosein
never
yet
was
mistaken
in
any
one
and
you
inshalla
will
surpass
your
father
only
let
him
continued
he
again
addressing
my
father
let
him
see
one
or
two
more
affairs
and
then
try
his
hand
himself
you
will
then
see
whether
i
am
wrong
or
not
it
is
well
exclaimed
my
father
believe
me
my
son
i
meant
not
to
upbraid
you
but
i
was
fearful
the
feeling
you
displayed
might
grow
upon
you
be
kind
as
you
will
to
those
around
you
affectionate
to
your
connections
pity
the
poor
give
alms
to
the
needy
but
remember
that
you
are
a
thug
and
have
sworn
relentless
destruction
to
all
those
whom
alla
may
throw
in
your
way
i
am
rebuked
said
i
and
your
words
have
sunk
into
my
heart
never
more
shall
you
have
to
say
of
me
that
i
flinched
from
my
duty
whenever
you
think
fit
i
am
ready
to
take
the
handkerchief
and
to
turn
the
subject
i
said
i
beg
to
represent
that
mahomed
the
bhuttote
promised
to
tell
me
some
history
of
the
man
who
died
last
night
and
i
call
on
him
to
fulfil
his
word
well
spoken
cried
a
dozen
of
the
men
mahomed
is
a
sure
hand
at
a
story
let
us
have
it
mahomed
after
stuffing
a
large
quantity
of
and
tobacco
into
his
mouth
crunched
it
several
times
between
his
teeth
and
after
a
copious
discharge
of
red
saliva
settled
himself
upon
his
heels
and
addressing
my
father
spoke
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
as
follows
i
was
born
at
boree
which
is
a
small
village
in
the
nagpoor
territory
my
father
was
a
thug
as
you
all
know
and
my
ancestors
were
the
same
for
generations
before
tales
of
their
feats
have
been
handed
down
in
our
family
from
father
to
son
and
they
are
worth
relating
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
story
they
had
been
prosperous
however
and
had
saved
money
enough
to
give
a
large
sum
at
the
court
of
nagpoor
for
the
office
and
lands
of
the
patelship
chief
magistracy
of
our
village
nevertheless
they
pursued
their
profession
of
thuggee
my
grandfather
kasim
as
many
of
you
know
was
as
notorious
a
leader
of
thugs
as
any
one
has
been
since
he
died
and
my
father
who
was
then
young
succeeded
to
his
property
and
situation
long
he
held
it
and
none
arose
to
dispute
his
claim
but
his
prosperity
was
not
fated
to
last
well
do
i
remember
the
day
when
some
soldiers
sent
by
order
of
the
peshkar
of
the
court
arrived
at
the
village
with
an
order
to
bring
him
to
presence
my
father
vainly
endeavoured
to
learn
from
them
the
reason
of
this
sudden
call
for
him
as
he
was
regular
in
his
payments
to
the
government
and
finding
reasoning
would
not
avail
he
strove
to
bribe
the
leader
of
the
party
into
conniving
at
his
absence
but
all
would
not
do
he
was
obliged
to
accompany
them
and
he
took
me
with
him
at
my
earnest
entreaty
i
was
then
a
young
man
probably
about
the
age
of
the
there
we
reached
nagpoor
after
some
long
marches
and
on
our
arrival
we
were
cast
into
a
vile
prison
our
legs
loaded
with
irons
and
we
were
denied
the
commonest
comforts
we
had
no
paun
or
tobacco
no
clean
clothes
were
not
allowed
to
see
any
one
and
were
given
the
coarsest
and
most
wretched
food
to
eat
in
this
manner
we
passed
four
long
months
my
father
in
vain
entreated
to
know
what
he
was
accused
of
or
who
was
his
accuser
and
equally
in
vain
were
his
attempts
to
have
his
situation
made
known
to
his
family
and
friends
we
wearied
ourselves
in
our
lonely
prison
with
conjectures
as
to
what
the
cause
of
the
misfortune
could
be
but
without
success
at
last
one
day
that
wretch
brij
lall
who
died
last
night
by
my
hand
came
into
our
prison
attended
by
soldiers
my
father
gave
himself
up
for
lost
and
thought
his
hour
of
death
had
arrived
but
recovering
he
appeared
to
recognise
brij
lall
and
instantly
assailed
him
with
imprecations
and
abuse
when
he
had
finished
brij
lall
eyeing
him
with
a
grim
look
said
perhaps
you
will
now
condescend
to
give
the
government
some
account
of
the
effects
of
jeysookhdas
the
merchant
who
lived
in
your
village
and
about
whose
affairs
you
well
know
i
was
sent
some
years
ago
you
may
also
remember
the
reception
and
treatment
you
gave
me
for
which
by
the
blessing
of
god
i
will
now
see
whether
i
can
not
effect
a
return
art
a
liar
and
a
rascal
of
a
mootsuddee
cried
my
father
not
one
word
shalt
thou
ever
know
from
my
lips
send
some
one
more
fit
to
confer
with
kasim
patel
and
he
will
tell
what
he
knows
but
not
one
word
to
thee
thou
dog
and
son
of
a
dog
will
see
said
the
vile
wretch
and
making
a
sign
to
the
soldiers
with
him
my
poor
father
was
seized
and
a
horse
filled
with
hot
ashes
being
tied
over
his
head
he
was
thumped
violently
on
the
back
till
he
was
forced
to
inhale
the
hot
dust
which
nearly
killed
him
this
was
repeated
several
times
on
every
refusal
to
tell
to
brij
lall
what
he
desired
to
know
at
last
nature
could
bear
no
more
and
he
fainted
the
wretch
then
left
the
prison
particularly
ordering
that
no
water
should
be
given
but
in
this
his
vile
intentions
were
frustrated
for
fortunately
some
had
remained
from
our
morning
supply
and
after
sprinkling
my
father
face
and
forcing
a
draught
into
his
mouth
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
sit
up
and
drink
some
more
which
revived
him
chapter
thought
i
should
have
died
my
son
said
my
father
at
length
see
what
a
black
heart
that
villain
must
have
to
treat
an
old
man
after
that
fashion
my
curses
on
him
and
his
he
will
prosper
awhile
but
judgment
for
this
and
all
his
villanies
will
at
last
overtake
him
me
said
i
quarrel
there
is
between
you
and
what
cause
he
has
to
persecute
you
in
this
manner
he
replied
you
shall
know
some
years
ago
when
you
were
but
a
boy
jeysookhdas
who
was
the
principal
sahoukar
in
the
village
died
on
his
he
sent
for
me
and
delivering
over
his
family
to
my
care
entreated
me
as
a
moosulman
and
one
of
the
faithful
to
protect
them
against
this
brij
lall
whom
he
had
in
the
public
durbar
at
nagpoor
beaten
with
a
shoe
for
slandering
him
in
the
vilest
manner
with
the
intent
of
ruining
his
reputation
in
fact
brij
lall
had
accused
him
of
making
away
with
some
of
the
revenue
for
jeysookhdas
was
the
channel
of
payment
not
only
of
the
revenue
of
our
village
but
of
those
around
us
amounting
in
the
year
to
nearly
a
lakh
of
rupees
fortunately
for
him
the
character
of
jeysookhdas
stood
too
high
for
the
aspersions
of
a
low
wretch
like
this
to
hurt
it
and
no
notice
was
taken
of
what
he
had
said
but
the
insult
he
had
received
never
left
the
mind
of
brij
lall
he
brooded
over
it
and
made
every
attempt
to
ruin
my
old
friend
who
as
he
had
powerful
enemies
at
the
court
was
ever
afterwards
kept
in
continual
dread
of
being
plundered
under
some
false
accusation
or
cast
into
prison
at
length
however
he
died
and
in
our
last
interview
he
implored
me
to
lose
no
time
in
sending
off
his
wife
and
family
to
their
country
marwar
with
their
jewels
and
what
money
i
could
collect
i
did
so
as
soon
as
i
possibly
could
under
an
escort
of
our
people
in
case
they
should
fall
in
with
other
thugs
on
the
road
had
scarcely
been
gone
a
week
when
this
brij
lall
and
another
mootsuddee
came
with
an
order
from
his
master
narayun
pundit
the
peshkar
to
seize
jeysookhdas
family
and
effects
the
order
was
a
verbal
one
and
this
being
a
very
unusual
circumstance
i
directly
refused
to
give
any
intelligence
about
the
family
or
account
of
the
effects
of
the
deceased
brij
lall
began
to
threaten
and
at
last
became
grossly
abusive
to
me
on
which
i
beat
him
with
my
shoe
had
him
turned
out
of
the
village
and
he
was
pelted
with
mud
and
stones
by
all
the
idle
lads
as
he
was
conducted
beyond
the
boundaries
never
heard
anything
more
of
brij
lall
but
i
knew
he
was
my
enemy
at
court
as
i
could
get
no
justice
for
many
complaints
i
made
against
the
ill
conduct
and
aggressions
of
a
neighbour
who
had
not
only
encroached
on
my
boundaries
but
seized
grain
which
had
been
cut
on
several
occasions
this
annoyance
at
last
reached
such
a
height
that
i
determined
to
send
a
deputation
to
the
court
to
petition
for
redress
it
was
however
fruitless
my
people
were
openly
opposed
by
brij
lall
who
it
seemed
had
risen
into
great
favour
and
power
i
was
openly
accused
as
a
usurper
of
the
patelship
of
our
village
a
person
was
set
up
by
brij
lall
as
the
descendant
of
the
real
patel
and
so
much
countenance
and
support
were
given
him
that
my
people
returned
to
me
in
great
alarm
and
utterly
discomfited
that
time
my
son
now
about
five
years
ago
i
have
been
constantly
alarmed
by
reports
which
have
reached
me
through
my
friends
at
nagpoor
i
have
been
warned
to
beware
of
assassination
to
allow
no
strange
men
to
come
into
the
village
nor
to
go
anywhere
without
a
sufficient
escort
this
however
has
not
as
you
know
interfered
with
our
profession
which
i
have
not
neglected
to
follow
but
in
other
respects
i
have
been
careful
in
spite
of
all
however
we
are
fairly
in
his
hands
and
may
alla
deliver
us
out
of
them
we
remained
some
days
without
another
visit
from
our
tormentor
but
at
last
he
came
again
and
my
poor
father
was
again
tortured
in
various
ways
but
without
effect
he
would
tell
nothing
dare
not
kill
me
cowardly
kafir
as
you
are
cried
he
to
brij
lall
inshalla
were
i
once
out
of
this
vile
prison
you
should
see
what
a
true
moosulman
could
do
for
himself
and
i
bid
you
beware
brij
lall
laughed
at
my
father
impotent
threats
and
again
left
us
we
had
remained
in
confinement
for
nearly
three
months
when
one
day
one
of
the
soldiers
of
our
guard
won
over
by
my
father
promises
and
really
struck
with
the
injustice
of
our
case
agreed
to
convey
a
petition
which
my
father
had
drawn
up
to
a
sahoukar
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
who
then
managed
the
money
affairs
of
our
village
and
resided
in
the
city
of
nagpoor
he
was
extremely
astonished
to
hear
of
our
situation
and
immediately
set
to
work
to
procure
our
liberation
but
this
was
no
easy
task
brij
lall
possessed
the
ear
of
the
minister
of
the
court
and
every
attempt
our
friend
made
was
frustrated
at
last
he
laid
our
case
before
the
chief
sahoukar
of
nagpoor
a
man
of
great
influence
who
went
to
the
minister
himself
expressly
on
our
behalf
we
were
told
that
the
next
day
we
were
to
appear
in
the
durbar
and
answer
the
accusations
which
had
been
made
against
us
and
at
the
hour
appointed
we
were
taken
to
the
house
where
the
peshkar
resided
and
where
he
heard
the
various
suits
and
cases
which
were
brought
before
him
narayun
pundit
was
then
a
young
man
but
he
was
looked
up
to
with
much
respect
by
all
who
had
any
dealings
with
him
he
was
considered
just
and
one
who
patiently
listened
to
both
sides
of
a
question
before
he
gave
his
decision
but
our
bitter
enemy
brij
lall
was
his
confidential
mootsuddee
and
conducted
himself
in
so
plausible
a
manner
that
his
tyrannies
were
never
discovered
brij
lall
made
his
accusation
against
my
father
he
said
that
by
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
accounts
of
the
effects
of
sahoukars
and
other
wealthy
persons
ought
to
be
furnished
to
the
government
when
they
died
without
male
children
that
it
was
well
known
that
jeysookhdas
was
wealthy
that
he
had
two
or
three
daughters
but
no
sons
and
that
they
had
no
right
to
have
touched
a
rupee
of
the
property
until
the
accounts
of
the
government
had
been
settled
again
that
my
father
was
not
the
rightful
patel
of
boree
and
that
the
person
who
was
descended
from
the
original
possessors
claimed
the
office
and
the
lands
which
were
then
in
my
father
possession
brij
lall
concluded
his
representation
by
saying
to
the
pundit
will
refrain
from
dwelling
oh
incarnation
of
brahma
on
the
usage
i
have
met
with
at
this
man
hands
twice
did
i
visit
his
village
and
twice
was
i
received
with
such
indignity
that
my
blood
boils
at
the
recollection
my
intentions
in
going
there
were
solely
for
the
good
of
the
government
and
had
i
but
then
complained
the
wrath
of
my
lord
would
have
descended
on
this
man
head
and
annihilated
him
and
his
family
but
i
devoured
my
grief
and
it
was
not
until
provoked
by
his
repeated
refusals
to
come
to
the
presence
and
his
contempt
of
the
messages
sent
to
him
about
the
effects
of
jeysookhdas
that
i
became
aware
that
the
dignity
of
the
government
was
set
at
nought
and
i
ordered
his
arrest
and
imprisonment
alla
alla
cried
my
father
lord
it
is
all
a
lie
i
call
alla
to
witness
that
i
never
disobeyed
any
order
of
the
government
when
sent
to
me
in
a
proper
form
have
i
not
eaten
the
salt
of
the
government
before
that
pitiful
wretch
was
born
and
who
is
he
that
my
lord
should
suffer
him
to
abuse
so
old
a
servant
of
the
state
in
his
presence
if
i
have
permission
i
will
represent
to
my
lord
that
i
am
not
in
fault
but
that
this
devil
ought
to
be
severely
punished
for
the
treatment
he
has
subjected
your
slave
to
will
hear
you
said
the
pundit
in
the
mean
time
it
will
be
proper
for
you
to
draw
up
a
statement
of
what
you
have
to
say
in
your
defence
in
order
that
its
relation
may
be
more
succinct
and
more
readily
comprehended
my
father
then
begged
not
to
be
confined
like
a
thief
and
offered
the
two
sahoukars
as
his
securities
to
appear
whenever
he
might
be
called
on
this
was
admitted
in
spite
of
brij
lall
protestations
that
no
securities
would
bind
us
and
we
walked
away
in
company
with
our
friends
my
father
as
he
passed
him
twirling
his
mustachios
and
looking
askance
at
him
with
many
a
muttered
inshalla
and
mashalla
all
of
which
brij
lall
answered
with
looks
of
the
most
deadly
spite
and
hatred
in
the
course
of
the
evening
an
account
was
drawn
up
in
persian
of
the
whole
of
brij
lall
conduct
from
first
to
last
and
we
took
it
to
the
durbar
in
every
expectation
of
seeing
him
disgraced
before
our
eyes
for
his
unwarrantable
treatment
of
us
but
we
were
doomed
to
disappointment
the
petition
was
read
by
narayun
pundit
and
he
proceeded
to
pass
judgment
in
the
case
which
was
that
brij
lall
had
much
exceeded
his
authority
in
imprisoning
my
father
that
he
had
acted
wrongly
in
persecuting
jeysookhdas
and
his
family
for
that
on
an
examination
of
the
accounts
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
claim
against
him
on
the
other
hand
that
my
father
had
behaved
ill
to
brij
lall
in
having
had
him
turned
out
of
the
village
disrespectfully
to
the
state
in
not
readily
giving
the
accounts
demanded
to
an
agent
who
was
known
to
have
the
power
to
ask
for
them
and
in
resisting
for
so
long
a
time
his
repeated
orders
my
father
was
going
to
reply
when
his
friend
the
sahoukar
stopped
him
said
he
it
to
come
out
of
a
battle
with
half
your
life
than
with
no
life
at
all
be
quiet
consider
that
you
have
escaped
which
is
what
very
few
do
from
the
net
which
was
thrown
round
you
by
that
low
rascal
and
be
thankful
my
father
had
only
to
pay
a
small
fine
for
what
he
had
done
to
brij
lall
he
considered
that
he
had
obtained
a
victory
and
so
the
matter
ended
i
never
shall
forget
the
advice
which
the
old
sahoukar
gave
my
father
when
after
some
days
sojourn
with
him
and
being
entertained
at
his
expense
we
were
about
to
set
out
for
our
village
said
he
know
that
brij
lall
well
he
will
never
give
up
his
revenge
you
have
seen
that
he
behaves
like
a
cow
before
his
patron
but
absent
from
him
he
is
a
tiger
in
heart
and
in
manners
and
such
is
the
influence
he
has
obtained
that
no
one
dares
to
oppose
him
you
have
indeed
got
well
out
of
his
clutches
but
had
not
your
affairs
been
taken
up
by
our
séth
you
would
have
remained
in
your
miserable
prison
until
his
hate
had
been
satisfied
by
your
death
from
the
constant
torment
and
he
would
have
subjected
you
to
alla
said
my
father
am
at
least
safe
now
without
great
caution
said
the
sahoukar
emissaries
will
beset
you
wherever
you
go
and
it
will
require
your
utmost
vigilance
and
wariness
to
avoid
them
by
your
soul
o
patel
i
beseech
you
not
to
disregard
what
i
say
or
you
will
repent
it
will
not
said
my
father
words
are
friendly
and
i
drink
them
in
as
grateful
sherbet
but
this
brij
lall
must
have
long
arms
and
powerful
if
he
can
reach
mahommedjee
patel
in
a
very
few
days
after
we
took
our
leave
and
returned
home
but
as
had
been
predicted
in
a
few
months
strange
men
began
to
be
seen
about
the
village
and
my
father
strange
to
say
disregarded
all
our
prayers
to
stay
at
home
especially
after
dusk
he
would
not
listen
to
us
called
the
men
we
had
seen
travellers
and
staid
from
home
late
of
nights
out
of
bravado
however
my
mother
grew
at
last
so
anxious
and
so
alarmed
about
these
repeated
visits
of
unknown
people
that
she
begged
of
me
never
to
leave
my
father
side
by
day
and
always
to
bring
him
home
with
me
from
the
fields
in
the
evening
this
i
did
for
a
long
time
but
one
night
one
cursed
night
would
that
i
had
never
seen
the
dawn
of
the
day
preceding
it
having
been
delayed
in
a
field
of
to
arrange
about
the
cutting
of
it
the
following
day
we
were
late
in
returning
home
we
were
accompanied
part
of
the
way
by
some
men
of
a
neighbouring
village
but
they
separated
from
us
about
half
a
coss
from
ours
and
the
remainder
of
the
way
if
we
followed
the
straight
road
was
one
which
was
not
thought
safe
and
by
which
no
one
went
after
nightfall
if
he
could
help
it
i
attempted
to
take
another
but
the
old
man
observed
it
and
said
sharply
is
not
the
way
that
road
will
keep
us
out
an
hour
longer
i
had
no
reason
to
give
to
dissuade
him
from
the
road
i
wished
to
avoid
though
an
feeling
that
there
was
danger
in
the
one
before
us
had
led
me
to
endeavour
to
take
the
other
but
my
friends
who
can
avoid
his
fate
if
it
is
the
will
of
alla
that
one
is
to
die
of
what
use
is
human
foresight
we
went
on
and
soon
reached
the
inclosed
fields
between
the
high
hedges
of
which
the
path
wound
it
was
scarcely
light
enough
for
us
to
see
our
way
but
we
knew
every
foot
of
the
road
all
at
once
as
we
proceeded
i
thought
i
saw
in
a
hedge
which
crossed
the
road
a
glimmer
as
if
of
the
match
of
a
gun
said
i
to
my
father
are
waylaid
there
are
people
behind
the
hedge
look
there
are
three
lighted
matches
are
a
fool
cried
he
are
are
you
afraid
has
my
son
become
a
coward
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
there
were
three
sharp
cracks
close
to
us
my
father
fell
on
his
face
without
uttering
a
sound
and
i
felt
a
coldness
and
numbness
all
down
my
back
with
a
sharp
pain
and
the
same
feeling
in
my
leg
i
became
sick
staggered
a
few
paces
and
then
fell
but
i
was
not
insensible
three
men
rushed
out
from
the
hedge
and
ran
towards
us
with
drawn
swords
seeing
that
neither
of
us
moved
one
of
them
turned
me
over
on
my
back
and
looked
into
my
face
i
shut
my
eyes
for
i
knew
if
they
were
open
i
should
not
live
an
instant
is
not
the
man
said
the
fellow
standing
over
me
have
missed
them
another
came
up
is
nearly
as
good
said
he
is
the
young
devil
the
son
the
father
depend
upon
it
is
the
other
come
and
see
and
they
left
me
they
went
to
where
my
poor
father
lay
but
i
could
not
see
what
they
did
i
suppose
they
examined
him
for
one
cried
we
have
been
successful
our
faces
will
be
bright
in
our
employer
sight
for
this
and
only
think
to
have
succeeded
so
easily
after
this
long
watching
the
old
dog
was
as
wary
as
a
fox
may
thank
me
said
another
who
had
not
as
yet
spoken
i
had
not
dogged
him
to
the
field
and
found
out
his
nearest
way
homewards
we
might
have
had
a
long
continuance
of
our
fruitless
watching
of
which
i
was
heartily
tired
come
continued
he
must
not
stay
the
country
will
be
too
hot
to
hold
us
madhoo
will
help
us
on
to
nagpoor
and
the
sooner
we
get
to
him
the
better
the
horses
i
know
are
all
ready
i
heard
no
more
i
was
sick
and
faint
and
lay
almost
insensible
for
a
long
time
the
pain
of
the
wounds
was
horrible
and
i
writhed
in
torment
the
night
too
was
dreadfully
cold
and
i
became
so
stiff
i
could
not
move
i
tried
even
to
get
as
far
as
my
poor
father
body
which
i
could
just
see
lying
on
its
back
but
motion
was
denied
me
i
lay
and
moaned
bitterly
i
heard
the
voices
of
persons
not
far
off
and
shouted
as
loud
as
i
could
but
they
did
not
hear
me
there
were
shots
fired
as
i
afterwards
heard
as
signals
to
us
but
i
could
not
answer
them
what
could
i
do
lying
as
i
did
like
a
crushed
reptile
my
senses
went
and
returned
as
though
i
were
dead
and
again
alive
oh
my
friends
how
can
i
describe
to
you
the
misery
of
that
night
at
last
i
was
roused
out
of
a
faint
by
some
persons
with
a
torch
standing
over
me
i
quickly
recognized
them
as
some
of
the
labourers
of
the
village
they
had
searched
every
lane
and
at
length
found
me
i
knew
not
what
they
said
or
did
but
they
broke
out
into
lamentations
on
seeing
my
father
body
and
taking
me
up
in
a
blanket
they
carried
me
to
the
village
and
set
me
down
at
the
door
of
my
father
house
alas
his
no
longer
my
friends
all
of
you
have
seen
the
grief
of
women
when
death
has
come
into
the
house
and
struck
down
a
father
a
brother
a
son
all
of
you
know
how
the
shrieks
and
moans
of
women
pierce
into
the
heart
and
turn
men
livers
into
water
till
my
father
body
arrived
there
was
no
cry
no
scream
my
mother
sat
in
a
corner
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
calling
on
my
father
name
in
a
low
tone
and
every
now
and
then
beating
her
breast
my
sister
attended
to
me
and
moistened
my
mouth
with
water
as
i
still
lay
unable
to
speak
but
fully
aware
of
all
that
was
going
on
around
me
some
old
women
of
the
village
sat
near
my
mother
shivering
in
the
cold
wind
which
whistled
through
the
house
and
speaking
among
themselves
in
whispers
there
was
but
a
small
lamp
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
which
with
its
flickering
light
now
revealed
one
group
now
another
causing
the
shadows
of
the
whole
to
leap
about
over
around
above
me
until
my
disturbed
brain
fancied
them
a
legion
of
devils
sent
to
torment
me
before
my
time
said
i
our
mother
to
me
i
am
dying
i
think
for
at
the
moment
i
felt
fainter
than
ever
no
you
must
not
die
you
must
not
leave
us
now
said
the
affectionate
girl
is
but
a
wound
the
barber
is
coming
and
will
take
out
the
ball
and
a
fomentation
is
being
prepared
by
the
hukeem
you
will
soon
be
well
as
she
spoke
this
a
sudden
gleam
of
torches
lighted
up
the
whole
space
outside
and
immediately
after
four
men
bearing
my
poor
body
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
i
summoned
energy
enough
to
sit
up
leaning
against
the
wall
and
the
body
was
brought
all
bloody
as
it
was
and
laid
down
i
should
not
say
laid
down
for
as
the
men
who
carried
it
were
preparing
to
let
it
down
gently
one
of
the
corners
of
the
blanket
slipped
and
the
corpse
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
giving
a
horrid
dull
squelch
the
sound
of
which
thrilled
through
every
nerve
for
an
instant
there
was
not
a
word
spoken
but
when
the
bloody
features
were
exposed
to
view
the
uproar
was
dreadful
headed
by
my
mother
all
the
old
women
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
body
and
began
the
most
shrieks
those
who
had
carried
it
were
also
affected
and
the
cry
reached
to
the
outside
where
the
crowd
assembled
took
it
up
till
the
heavens
were
cracked
with
the
noise
of
the
lamentations
it
was
in
vain
that
i
endeavoured
to
make
myself
heard
but
on
a
sudden
the
noise
ceased
and
silence
was
ordered
by
the
kazee
of
the
village
who
entered
he
cast
a
look
on
the
dead
body
and
then
asked
for
me
has
done
this
said
he
do
you
suspect
tell
us
by
your
soul

us
ere
it
be
too
late
to
overtake
them
whoever
they
may
be
patel
of
etare
said
i
the
villains

horses

are
gone
ere
this
there
is
no
use
sending
have
horses
who
have
gone
did
you
say
cried
he
with
impatience
for
a
time
and
strive
all
you
can
to
let
us
know
how
this
was
how
it
happened
i
had
barely
strength
but
i
gave
a
short
relation
of
the
whole
alla
it
is
the
work
of
mahdoo
himself
said
one
we
will
burn
his
village
before
the
morning
breaks
is
the
doing
of
rheim
khan
cried
another
rheim
khan
was
my
father
and
they
had
been
at
bitter
enmity
takes
the
name
of
rheim
khan
cried
my
mother
his
tongue
be
blistered
and
rot
in
his
mouth
may
his
end
be
like
this
pointing
to
the
corpse
and
again
she
resumed
her
howls
and
lamentations
you
hear
the
woman
said
one
fellow
close
to
me
would
not
curse
at
that
rate
if
rheim
khan
was
free
from
suspicion
said
i
as
loud
as
i
could
know
who
is
the
author
of
this
at
least
i
have
a
right
to
have
the
strongest
suspicions
mahdoo
patel
had
no
hand
in
it
he
is
a
coward
rheim
khan
though
he
hated
the
old
man
could
never
have
done
or
planned
this
no
it
is
neither
it
is
one
whom
we
poor
people
can
never
reach
from
his
height
of
station
one
whom
the
pleasure
of
alla
alone
can
bring
down
to
the
condition
of
him
who
is
there
i
mean
brij
lall
the
accursed
the
merciless
i
was
exhausted
with
speaking
and
sank
down
spoke
said
my
mother
raising
her
head
surely
heard
the
voice
of
my
son
am
here
my
mother
said
i
and
she
turned
to
me
here
thou
alive
coward
hast
thou
come
to
me
to
see
thy
father
a
bloody
corpse
in
his
own
house
where
wert
thou
that
thou
diedst
not
with
him
did
i
not
caution
thee
never
to
leave
the
headstrong
old
man
who
would
persist
in
disregarding
all
advice
and
in
exposing
himself
at
night
can
not
answer
thee
now
my
mother
said
i
i
was
with
him
see
here
i
fell
also
though
i
did
not
die
then
i
feel
that
i
shall
do
so
soon
i
opened
my
vest
and
showed
her
the
hole
the
ball
had
made
out
of
which
a
drop
or
two
of
black
blood
every
now
and
then
oozed
she
looked
at
it
and
threw
herself
at
my
feet
art
no
coward
she
sobbed
out
art
no
coward
thou
hast
bled
in
thy
father
defence
and
i
can
say
nothing
but
that
it
is
the
will
of
alla
and
his
fate
who
can
avoid
his
destiny
but
it
is
hard
to
lose
both
husband
and
son
husband
and
son
and
i
an
old
woman
and
she
went
from
me
and
resumed
her
place
at
the
side
of
the
body
one
by
one
the
neighbours
left
us
the
name
of
brij
lall
had
silenced
every
one
and
in
a
very
short
time
there
remained
only
the
watchers
by
the
corpse
my
sister
and
myself
she
was
but
a
girl
my
friends
but
she
watched
by
me
and
fomented
my
shoulder
and
leg
with
warm
water
until
the
coagulated
blood
dissolved
and
i
was
easier
how
i
wished
for
the
light
to
be
put
out
but
they
would
not
hear
of
it
i
have
seen
death
in
many
many
forms
since
but
never
have
i
seen
anything
that
i
could
compare
with
my
remembrance
of
my
father
appearance
his
features
were
pinched
up
his
lips
drawn
tightly
across
his
mouth
showing
his
upper
and
under
teeth
his
eyes
were
wide
open
for
they
could
not
be
closed
and
the
flaring
light
now
rising
now
sinking
as
it
was
agitated
by
the
wind
caused
an
appearance
as
if
of
the
features
moving
and
gibbering
with
that
ghastly
expression
on
them
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
them
and
lay
gazing
at
them
till
the
day
broke
the
barber
who
had
been
absent
at
a
neighbouring
village
soon
afterwards
arrived
and
examined
my
wounds
one
ball
had
entered
my
shoulder
and
had
passed
into
my
neck
he
groped
in
the
wound
for
some
time
with
a
pair
of
pincers
and
after
putting
me
to
horrible
pain
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
it
and
drawing
it
out
i
was
then
easier
the
blood
flowed
copiously
the
wound
in
the
leg
was
only
through
the
flesh
and
having
taken
some
opium
i
soon
fell
asleep
and
awoke
though
still
in
pain
yet
easier
than
i
had
been
my
father
had
by
this
time
been
buried
and
i
was
left
with
the
consciousness
of
having
one
enemy
and
one
too
who
would
not
forego
his
revenge
even
to
the
son
of
his
victim
the
old
kazee
could
recommend
nothing
could
suggest
no
measures
to
be
pursued
to
bring
the
murderers
to
conviction
so
as
he
said
we
sat
down
on
the
carpet
of
patience
to
smoke
the
pipe
of
regret
and
to
drown
our
affliction
in
the
best
way
we
could
matters
continued
to
run
smoothly
for
the
period
of
a
year
i
was
considered
to
have
succeeded
to
my
father
rights
when
one
day
the
man
who
had
been
set
up
by
brij
lall
as
the
real
patel
in
opposition
to
my
father
arrived
at
the
village
with
a
body
of
armed
men
and
with
orders
for
his
installation
the
villagers
were
too
weak
to
resist
this
tyranny
and
i
was
forced
to
resign
all
my
claims
to
the
new
comer
by
this
time
my
sister
had
gone
to
the
house
of
her
and
i
sent
my
mother
after
her
for
i
had
no
longer
a
home
i
left
the
village
with
an
aching
heart
to
see
if
my
father
friends
the
sahoukars
could
do
anything
for
me
at
the
court
but
they
too
had
changed
as
i
might
perhaps
have
expected
and
would
do
nothing
brij
lall
they
said
was
too
powerful
to
be
interfered
with
and
they
recommended
me
to
give
up
all
hopes
of
justice
as
the
attempt
to
fix
the
crime
of
murder
upon
him
with
the
insufficient
evidence
i
possessed
would
be
attended
with
my
certain
destruction
nor
would
they
assist
me
to
regain
my
lost
rights
so
that
i
was
friendless
and
as
it
were
forsaken
in
the
world
i
had
but
one
resource
i
joined
the
first
band
of
thugs
i
could
discover
though
i
had
previously
not
practised
the
profession
and
i
have
since
lived
a
lonely
and
wretched
life
in
the
world
my
mother
is
long
since
dead
my
sister
still
lives
and
has
some
children
she
is
happy
and
has
no
remembrance
of
the
past
i
pay
her
a
visit
now
and
then
and
am
received
with
affection
and
kindness
she
is
the
only
one
in
this
world
except
you
my
friends
who
cares
for
me
she
believes
me
to
be
a
soldier
in
the
service
of
holkar
and
she
will
never
know
to
the
contrary
praise
be
to
alla
however
my
enemy
has
died
by
my
own
hand
and
i
am
content
for
i
am
revenged
some
of
you
my
friends
will
lay
me
in
my
grave
when
my
time
comes
and
it
will
not
be
long
i
have
lived
hitherto
for
the
deed
i
did
last
night
there
is
no
excitement
for
me
in
the
future
and
it
matters
not
how
soon
the
old
thug
is
laid
in
the
earth
this
is
my
story
such
as
it
is
if
i
have
arrested
your
attention
and
gratified
the
my
intentions
have
been
fulfilled
and
i
am
content
the
whole
assembly
was
struck
and
affected
by
the
old
man
story
and
all
joined
in
consoling
him
for
his
misfortunes
but
i
was
particularly
interested
in
them
as
they
went
more
to
convince
me
that
the
hand
of
alla
was
upon
all
our
doings
than
even
my
father
history
both
were
striking
instances
but
the
thug
particularly
so
it
really
seemed
as
though
brij
lall
had
been
given
into
our
hands
nay
to
the
very
hands
of
him
he
had
so
oppressed
to
receive
his
punishment
on
earth
previous
to
the
eternal
fires
of
jehunum
henceforward
said
i
to
myself
no
one
shall
have
it
to
say
of
ameer
ali
that
he
hung
back
when
occasion
required
his
personal
exertions
i
will
emulate
my
father
and
the
country
shall
know
and
feel
that
i
am
a
scourge
on
its
wickedness
no
one
shall
escape
me
i
shall
act
up
to
the
utmost
of
the
oath
i
have
taken
wage
unrelenting
war
with
the
whole
human
race
and
inshalla
they
shall
see
whether
ameer
ali
can
not
lead
his
men
on
to
actions
which
will
by
far
surpass
any
of
the
present
times
and
equal
those
the
traditions
of
which
remain
among
us
from
that
day
i
put
myself
under
the
tuition
of
the
gooroo
or
teacher
of
the
band
an
old
thug
who
was
worn
out
with
age
but
had
been
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
dexterous
bhuttotes
or
stranglers
who
had
lived
within
the
memories
of
any
of
the
men
of
our
company
he
was
a
hindoo
a
rajpoot
and
though
his
frame
was
dry
and
shrivelled
yet
from
his
height
breadth
of
shoulders
and
sinews
which
were
developed
the
more
by
the
absence
of
flesh
to
cover
them
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
been
a
man
of
immense
strength
and
power
and
added
to
this
if
his
great
dexterity
in
using
the
handkerchief
was
considered
the
stories
of
his
superior
prowess
might
easily
be
credited
i
had
hitherto
not
associated
much
with
him
beyond
a
courteous
demeanour
to
each
other
we
had
been
but
little
acquainted
so
i
begged
my
father
to
take
me
to
him
deliver
me
over
to
his
care
and
request
of
him
to
initiate
me
thoroughly
in
the
practice
of
a
bhuttote
he
was
delighted
at
this
spontaneous
offer
on
my
part
readily
acceded
to
my
wishes
and
at
once
put
me
under
the
care
of
hoosein
and
roop
singh
the
old
thug
i
have
mentioned
who
belonged
to
hoosein
party
for
a
few
days
said
my
father
i
will
not
see
you
you
shall
remain
with
them
and
when
you
return
to
me
let
me
welcome
you
as
ready
and
willing
to
take
a
part
in
the
next
affair
we
may
be
engaged
in
the
day
after
we
began
in
earnest
roop
singh
repeated
incantations
over
me
i
ate
no
meat
indeed
tasted
nothing
but
milk
for
four
days
numerous
sacrifices
were
made
to
the
sacred
pickaxe
every
omen
was
observed
and
as
i
sat
under
the
trees
after
our
daily
march
scarcely
a
bird
alighted
on
them
but
there
was
some
conclusion
drawn
from
it
and
the
appearance
of
different
animals
and
birds
as
we
commenced
our
march
in
the
mornings
were
particularly
observed
and
noted
i
was
naturally
very
inquisitive
as
to
the
meaning
of
all
that
was
done
to
me
and
for
me
but
the
old
gooroo
would
not
enlighten
me
my
son
said
he
when
i
was
your
age
these
ceremonies
were
performed
over
me
to
make
me
fearless
and
active
and
cunning
so
as
to
ensnare
all
who
came
within
my
reach
and
to
avoid
my
enemies
to
make
me
fortunate
and
to
cause
me
to
win
fame
in
all
these
i
have
never
failed
two
others
upon
whom
i
have
performed
them
are
rising
fast
to
be
jemadars
such
is
their
address
and
courage
and
you
too
will
be
the
same
therefore
ask
no
questions
content
yourself
with
knowing
that
everything
is
going
on
properly
and
to
my
complete
satisfaction
for
i
have
not
observed
one
unfavourable
omen
on
the
fifth
morning
the
handkerchief
was
put
into
my
hand
and
after
having
been
bathed
anointed
with
oils
and
marked
on
the
forehead
with
vermilion
as
a
votary
of
bhowanee
i
was
declared
a
bhuttote
one
thing
i
forgot
said
the
old
man
laughing
as
he
gave
me
the
cloth
and
that
was
the
principal
perhaps
i
have
not
shown
you
how
to
use
it
and
i
have
a
peculiar
knack
of
my
own
which
is
easily
communicated
you
will
soon
learn
it
he
took
the
cloth
tied
a
large
knot
at
one
end
with
a
piece
of
silver
inserted
in
it
this
he
held
in
his
left
hand
the
plain
end
being
in
his
right
and
about
as
much
space
between
them
as
would
nearly
compass
a
man
neck
the
closed
hands
had
the
palms
uppermost
now
said
he
mark
this
and
when
you
throw
the
cloth
from
behind
and
have
got
it
tight
suddenly
turn
your
knuckles
into
the
neck
giving
a
sharp
wrench
to
either
side
that
may
be
most
convenient
if
done
in
a
masterly
manner
instant
death
ensues
i
took
the
cloth
and
held
it
as
he
directed
but
it
did
not
please
him
give
it
me
back
that
i
may
show
you
more
exactly
on
your
own
neck
said
he
indeed
no
cried
i
laughing
you
might
think
i
was
a
traveller
and
have
me
down
in
an
instant
without
intending
it
but
i
perfectly
understand
the
method
then
try
it
on
ameer
ali
i
shall
see
by
the
position
of
your
hands
whether
you
know
anything
about
it
i
obeyed
him
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
laughed
that
will
never
do
you
could
not
kill
a
child
in
that
way
he
said
when
you
feel
my
hands
round
your
neck
you
will
understand
so
i
submitted
with
as
good
a
grace
as
i
could
though
i
did
not
at
all
like
the
idea
my
blood
ran
cold
through
me
as
i
felt
his
chill
clammy
hands
about
my
neck
but
he
did
not
hurt
me
and
i
saw
where
my
error
had
been
i
tried
it
on
him
as
he
had
shown
me
several
times
and
was
declared
at
last
to
be
perfect
now
you
only
want
practice
ameer
ali
said
he
inshalla
roop
singh
i
replied
we
shall
have
plenty
of
it
one
beginning
and
i
fear
not
for
the
rest
like
a
tiger
which
once
having
tasted
human
blood
will
if
possible
take
no
other
and
runs
every
risk
to
get
it
so
i
feel
it
will
be
with
me
and
it
was
so
sahib
i
knew
myself
i
had
spoken
truly
chapter
vi
nothing
of
any
moment
occurred
during
the
rest
of
our
march
to
nagpoor
if
i
except
the
deaths
of
a
few
solitary
travellers
who
had
fallen
by
the
hands
of
a
small
portion
of
the
band
who
had
been
sent
to
another
road
which
ran
parallel
to
the
one
on
which
we
marched
and
as
i
know
no
particulars
of
them
worth
mentioning
i
shall
at
once
lead
you
sahib
to
our
encampment
at
nagpoor
outside
the
city
is
a
large
tank
on
the
margin
of
which
the
majority
of
the
band
encamped
my
father
and
few
others
put
up
in
the
town
for
the
purpose
of
converting
the
booty
already
obtained
into
money
it
was
not
a
difficult
task
for
as
the
property
which
had
belonged
to
brij
lall
was
easily
saleable
we
soon
found
purchasers
among
the
numerous
goldsmiths
and
sahoukars
of
the
city
in
one
of
his
dealings
with
a
sahoukar
my
father
casually
stated
that
he
was
proceeding
to
hyderabad
with
some
men
he
had
brought
from
his
village
and
for
whom
he
was
in
hope
of
procuring
employment
under
as
he
said
his
brother
who
was
in
the
service
of
the
then
reigning
prince
sikundur
jah
the
sahoukar
at
once
proposed
to
accompany
us
and
to
give
my
father
and
his
men
a
handsome
remuneration
if
he
would
protect
him
on
the
road
as
he
had
he
said
been
for
some
time
on
the
look
out
for
an
opportunity
to
put
himself
under
the
escort
of
a
respectable
man
who
might
be
travelling
there
with
a
number
of
followers
at
that
time
sahib
in
consequence
of
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
and
the
many
rumours
there
were
of
wars
any
man
of
respectability
who
was
idle
in
his
village
and
could
persuade
a
few
companions
to
accompany
him
as
their
leader
was
sure
of
employment
as
a
soldier
if
he
presented
himself
at
any
of
the
courts
of
hindostan
or
the
dukhun
sindea
holkar
the
peshwah
every
prince
in
fact
had
a
large
army
which
was
tolerably
paid
and
it
was
better
to
serve
with
them
than
to
pursue
any
other
occupation
we
had
met
several
bands
of
such
men
on
our
road
down
to
nagpoor
so
that
our
company
presented
no
extraordinary
or
suspicious
appearance
especially
under
my
father
who
looked
like
a
soldier
was
always
well
armed
and
dressed
rode
a
fine
horse
and
on
occasions
of
residing
in
or
even
passing
through
a
city
was
always
attended
by
a
number
of
the
thugs
as
his
escort
and
his
appearance
was
certainly
what
he
represented
himself
to
be
to
the
sahoukar
my
father
readily
agreed
to
the
sahoukar
terms
and
bound
himself
down
in
a
day
or
two
afterwards
to
be
at
his
disposal
and
to
afford
him
protection
as
far
as
hyderabad
at
a
secret
conference
they
had
that
day
the
sahoukar
as
my
father
told
me
informed
him
that
he
was
going
to
take
down
a
good
deal
of
treasure
some
valuable
jewels
and
some
merchandize
by
which
he
hoped
to
get
a
handsome
profit
at
hyderabad
nay
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
show
him
what
he
was
going
to
take
with
him
and
you
can
not
imagine
sahib
the
joy
that
was
diffused
in
our
camp
at
the
certainty
of
so
rich
a
booty
in
order
to
give
our
band
as
much
of
the
appearance
of
soldiers
as
possible
my
father
purchased
for
those
who
had
none
matchlocks
swords
and
shields
and
distributed
them
and
in
truth
when
all
the
men
were
drawn
up
to
be
examined
they
were
a
set
of
fellows
for
as
this
expedition
had
been
considered
one
of
extreme
adventure
none
but
the
youngest
and
most
had
been
selected
for
it
they
were
all
informed
of
the
agreement
which
had
been
made
with
the
sahoukar
cautioned
to
put
on
as
military
and
swaggering
an
air
as
possible
and
in
short
to
behave
as
soldiers
would
during
the
part
of
the
journey
they
would
have
to
appear
as
his
escort
this
was
in
the
evening
and
during
the
night
the
camp
was
a
scene
of
jollity
the
booty
in
view
nay
almost
within
their
grasp
was
sufficient
to
cheer
them
a
set
of
dancing
girls
was
invited
from
the
city
and
in
listening
to
their
songs
the
best
part
of
the
night
was
passed
we
expected
the
sahoukar
anxiously
all
the
day
and
just
at
nightfall
he
came
to
our
camp
in
a
small
travelling
cart
with
one
or
two
servants
and
two
or
three
small
ponies
on
which
a
tent
and
his
baggage
were
laden
and
ten
bullocks
with
their
drivers
altogether
there
were
eight
men
including
himself
we
saw
but
little
of
him
during
our
march
to
oomraotee
my
father
and
hoosein
used
sometimes
to
sit
with
him
in
his
tent
during
the
evening
and
i
was
also
introduced
to
him
he
was
a
large
unwieldy
man
and
i
began
to
think
whether
he
would
not
be
a
good
subject
for
my
first
trial
i
mentioned
my
thoughts
to
my
father
and
he
was
much
pleased
with
me
i
had
intended
to
have
appointed
you
to
be
his
bhuttote
said
he
he
is
too
fat
to
make
any
resistance
and
he
will
be
the
easier
work
for
you
who
have
not
as
yet
tried
what
you
can
do
so
from
that
time
i
looked
upon
him
as
my
first
victim
i
daily
went
to
my
instructor
to
gain
fresh
insight
into
my
profession
and
practised
the
handling
of
the
cloth
in
every
way
he
pointed
out
to
me
he
one
day
proposed
to
inveigle
a
lonely
traveller
into
our
camp
in
order
that
i
might
try
my
hand
upon
him
first
but
i
objected
to
this
as
i
felt
confident
in
my
own
powers
and
was
determined
as
i
had
selected
the
sahoukar
that
he
should
be
the
first
man
i
pass
over
our
journey
as
nothing
worth
mentioning
occurred
on
the
road
we
arrived
at
the
town
and
took
up
our
quarters
in
the
bazar
i
was
much
struck
with
its
apparent
opulence
and
prosperity
but
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
as
it
was
the
place
where
all
the
merchandize
and
manufactures
of
hindostan
were
brought
to
be
distributed
over
the
dukhun
and
where
all
the
spices
drugs
and
other
articles
of
trade
arrived
from
the
south
to
be
sent
to
different
parts
of
hindostan
the
town
seemed
to
be
full
of
sahoukars
houses
and
large
shops
and
in
the
bazars
were
displayed
every
article
that
i
had
ever
heard
of
besides
many
others
from
the
europeans
at
bombay
which
i
had
never
seen
before
and
i
wandered
about
every
day
in
company
with
my
father
admiring
and
wondering
at
all
i
saw
the
sahoukar
business
detained
him
some
days
at
this
place
at
the
end
of
which
we
again
set
forward
with
an
addition
to
his
people
of
three
men
who
drove
a
few
bullocks
heavily
laden
with
cloths
which
we
heard
were
of
the
most
costly
description
being
those
of
benares
which
are
justly
celebrated
for
their
richness
and
beauty
nor
did
this
addition
at
all
disconcert
our
plans
for
in
consequence
of
the
sahoukar
having
accompanied
us
hoosein
party
still
remained
and
indeed
if
it
had
not
there
were
plenty
of
my
father
to
have
secured
the
whole
without
trouble
from
oomraotee
to
mungloor
is
three
stages
and
there
said
my
father
i
shall
decide
on
a
place
for
the
ending
of
this
matter
if
i
remember
right
there
are
some
low
hills
and
ravines
not
far
beyond
it
which
will
give
us
excellent
opportunities
for
concealing
the
bodies
and
do
you
hoosein
inquire
who
among
your
men
know
the
ground
for
it
will
be
necessary
to
send
some
one
who
does
with
the
lughaees
inquiries
were
accordingly
made
when
we
reached
our
first
stage
a
village
named
baum
and
it
was
discovered
that
three
men
were
intimately
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
road
and
had
been
on
the
point
of
coming
forward
to
recommend
that
one
spot
in
particular
should
not
be
neglected
they
were
closely
questioned
by
my
father
and
hoosein
and
they
gave
a
very
clear
description
of
a
place
which
seemed
to
be
so
well
fitted
for
the
purpose
that
it
was
at
once
determined
on
and
the
men
promised
extra
reward
if
they
would
exert
themselves
i
now
felt
that
my
time
had
come
that
in
a
very
few
hours
i
might
take
my
place
with
the
rest
having
established
my
right
to
be
their
equal
perhaps
it
was
weakness
sahib
but
from
that
time
i
avoided
the
sight
of
the
sahoukar
as
much
as
possible
i
saw
him
once
or
twice
on
the
road
but
an
involuntary
shudder
crept
through
me
and
like
a
fool
i
almost
wished
i
were
back
again
at
our
village
but
it
was
too
late
to
retract
i
had
a
character
to
gain
and
the
esteem
of
him
who
best
loved
me
my
father
to
secure
to
turn
back
was
impossible
and
to
evince
the
smallest
cowardice
was
to
degrade
myself
irretrievably
i
had
therefore
no
resource
but
to
do
my
best
and
in
truth
when
the
sahoukar
was
not
before
me
i
felt
no
reluctance
to
perform
my
part
but
on
the
contrary
the
same
desire
i
had
before
experienced
to
distinguish
myself
we
reached
mungloor
it
is
a
large
town
full
of
mahomedans
and
celebrated
for
the
shrine
of
meer
hyat
kalundur
a
saint
of
great
antiquity
his
tomb
is
held
in
particular
veneration
and
it
was
judged
highly
expedient
that
we
should
offer
up
our
prayers
for
the
success
of
our
enterprise
accordingly
my
father
myself
hoosein
and
some
other
mahomedans
went
to
the
tomb
and
having
observed
all
the
ceremonies
required
and
directed
by
the
attendant
moolas
we
were
sitting
in
conversation
with
two
of
them
when
we
discovered
by
a
casual
sign
made
by
my
father
to
hoosein
which
was
recognised
by
them
that
they
were
thugs
most
extraordinary
thought
i
here
are
sacred
ministers
of
our
faith
thugs
as
well
as
ourselves
but
after
some
conversation
with
them
i
could
see
that
my
father
esteemed
them
lightly
these
fellows
can
hardly
be
thugs
said
my
father
to
hoosein
as
we
descended
the
steps
of
the
shrine
into
the
outer
court
where
many
of
the
men
had
put
up
for
the
day
and
we
had
better
caution
the
people
against
getting
acquainted
with
them
i
do
not
think
they
will
notice
us
further
as
it
is
but
they
might
do
so
did
they
know
whom
we
had
with
us
you
are
right
said
hoosein
it
might
perhaps
be
better
were
the
men
told
not
to
disclose
whom
we
have
with
us
they
were
accordingly
cautioned
and
it
turned
out
that
we
had
done
right
as
we
heard
afterwards
that
the
moolas
were
most
inquisitive
and
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
we
had
come
so
far
and
were
going
so
much
further
without
an
object
and
i
have
no
doubt
had
we
not
acted
as
we
did
and
disclosed
our
intentions
to
or
asked
for
assistance
from
them
that
they
would
have
either
betrayed
us
to
the
village
authorities
or
insisted
on
such
a
share
of
the
spoil
which
we
dared
not
have
refused
as
would
have
materially
lessened
ours
after
prayers
we
returned
to
the
place
where
we
had
put
up
and
found
a
man
belonging
to
the
sahoukar
waiting
for
us
he
said
his
master
would
stay
that
evening
where
he
was
with
a
friend
instead
of
coming
outside
the
village
to
our
encampment
but
that
my
father
was
to
leave
some
men
with
him
as
a
guard
and
that
he
would
set
out
early
in
the
night
as
he
was
determined
to
go
on
to
bassim
a
town
some
distance
off
where
he
had
another
friend
whom
he
wished
to
visit
that
as
it
was
so
long
a
march
we
must
start
early
so
as
to
allow
time
for
a
halt
for
refreshment
at
a
village
half
way
my
father
did
not
like
the
idea
of
sending
the
men
into
the
village
lest
they
should
be
recognized
as
thugs
by
any
of
the
thug
villagers
yet
he
could
not
but
acquiesce
and
some
were
sent
as
soon
as
night
closed
in
that
there
might
be
hardly
a
chance
of
their
being
known
in
the
meantime
every
preparation
was
made
by
the
party
of
gravediggers
who
were
to
precede
us
and
at
nightfall
they
also
left
the
ground
fourteen
in
number
with
the
two
who
knew
the
spot
in
company
with
them
they
were
confident
as
to
the
precise
place
they
should
fix
on
and
described
the
hills
as
little
more
than
low
mounds
caused
by
some
high
land
breaking
into
ravines
that
if
they
remembered
right
the
road
was
very
stony
and
crossed
by
several
small
streams
whose
banks
were
lined
by
thick
brushwood
and
that
in
any
one
of
these
in
which
there
might
be
no
water
the
bhil
or
grave
should
be
prepared
they
were
also
desired
to
place
men
in
advance
to
give
information
that
we
might
all
take
our
places
and
fall
on
when
the
signal
was
given
it
was
now
generally
known
to
all
that
i
was
to
have
the
sahoukar
to
myself
and
many
thronged
about
me
to
see
how
i
looked
forward
to
my
first
trial
every
one
cheered
me
and
i
must
own
this
gave
me
great
confidence
as
the
time
approached
my
soul
burned
for
the
work
like
that
of
a
young
and
brave
soldier
to
see
the
first
flash
of
his
bright
sword
in
anger
my
father
enjoyed
my
demeanour
in
silent
satisfaction
he
spoke
not
but
there
was
exultation
in
his
eye
as
he
looked
fondly
upon
me
and
i
felt
that
i
should
not
disappoint
him
the
whole
band
seemed
to
be
impressed
particularly
with
the
importance
of
the
present
matter
for
they
collected
into
groups
and
though
each
man
knew
exactly
what
he
had
to
do
and
what
was
appointed
for
his
comrade
yet
they
seemed
to
be
discussing
the
whole
till
one
by
one
they
separated
and
each
stretched
himself
out
to
gain
the
little
rest
he
could
before
the
time
arrived
which
would
call
him
into
active
nay
deadly
strife
my
father
and
hoosein
too
all
except
myself
i
was
sitting
outside
our
slight
tent
when
roop
singh
came
to
me
baba
said
he
as
he
sat
down
how
feel
you
is
your
heart
firm
and
your
blood
cool
both
said
i
nothing
can
change
my
heart
and
feel
my
hand
is
my
blood
hot
no
said
the
old
man
taking
it
in
his
it
is
not
nor
does
it
tremble
this
is
as
it
should
be
i
have
seen
many
prepare
for
their
first
trial
but
never
one
so
coolly
and
calmly
as
you
do
but
this
is
all
in
consequence
of
the
blessed
muntrus
which
have
been
read
over
you
and
the
ceremonies
you
went
through
perhaps
so
said
i
but
i
think
i
should
have
been
much
the
same
without
them
now
may
bhowanee
forgive
you
proud
boy
he
replied
you
know
not
their
efficacy
was
there
ever
a
prouder
being
than
i
was
a
rajpoot
by
birth
and
one
of
the
purest
tribes
had
i
not
slain
wild
beasts
or
helped
to
slay
them
from
my
childhood
but
when
a
man
was
shown
me
and
the
handkerchief
alone
put
into
my
hands
to
destroy
him
with
indeed
i
trembled
nor
was
it
for
a
long
time
that
i
could
be
brought
to
attempt
it
but
continued
roop
singh
you
have
one
more
ceremony
to
go
through
which
on
no
account
must
be
neglected
go
call
your
father
hoosein
and
bhudrinath
that
they
may
be
present
we
were
all
soon
assembled
and
the
gooroo
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
field
he
stopped
and
turning
to
the
direction
in
which
we
were
to
proceed
raised
his
hands
in
a
supplicatory
manner
and
cried
oh
kalee
maha
kalee
if
the
traveller
now
with
us
should
die
by
the
hand
of
this
thy
new
votary
vouchsafe
us
the
thibaoo
all
of
us
stood
silently
and
wonderful
to
relate
even
at
that
late
hour
an
ass
brayed
on
the
right
hand
the
gooroo
was
overjoyed
there
cried
he
to
the
others
was
there
ever
so
complete
an
acceptation
of
a
votary
the
omen
almost
followed
the
prayer
shookr
alla
exclaimed
my
father
it
is
now
complete
he
will
go
forth
and
conquer
there
only
remains
for
you
to
tie
the
knot
that
i
will
do
when
we
return
said
the
gooroo
and
when
we
reached
our
encampment
he
took
my
handkerchief
and
untying
the
knot
which
had
been
previously
made
he
retied
it
placing
a
piece
of
silver
in
it
presenting
it
to
me
he
said
receive
this
now
sacred
weapon
put
your
trust
in
it
in
the
holy
name
of
kalee
i
bid
it
do
your
will
i
received
it
in
my
right
hand
and
carefully
tucked
it
into
my
waistband
that
i
might
not
lose
it
and
that
it
might
be
ready
for
action
when
required
we
remained
in
conversation
for
some
time
and
then
threw
ourselves
on
our
carpets
to
snatch
a
short
rest
till
one
of
our
men
from
the
village
came
and
told
us
that
the
sahoukar
was
preparing
to
move
and
had
sent
him
on
to
warn
us
the
band
were
quickly
roused
and
our
beasts
laden
and
we
drew
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
await
his
arrival
he
was
not
long
in
coming
and
we
all
moved
on
together
the
night
was
beautiful
the
road
excellent
and
we
pushed
on
in
high
spirits
the
booty
we
were
to
possess
the
tact
with
which
the
whole
matter
had
been
managed
from
the
first
would
mark
it
as
an
enterprise
of
a
superior
description
one
that
any
one
of
us
would
be
proud
to
mention
and
which
would
cause
a
considerable
sensation
not
only
in
the
country
but
among
the
numerous
bands
of
thugs
of
hindostan
more
especially
those
we
were
to
rejoin
at
the
conclusion
of
our
season
we
had
proceeded
about
two
coss
when
there
was
a
murmur
among
the
men
who
led
and
one
of
the
scouts
was
an
instant
afterwards
seen
making
his
way
to
where
we
were
my
father
recognized
him
as
one
of
those
he
had
sent
on
bhilla
manjeh
have
you
cleared
the
hole
he
eagerly
inquired
manjeh
said
the
man
it
is
cleared
and
it
is
all
ready
see
you
yon
low
hills
a
streamlet
as
i
told
you
runs
from
them
and
it
is
a
rare
bhil
that
we
have
made
jemadar
sahib
you
will
say
we
have
done
well
and
how
far
may
it
be
demanded
my
father
about
half
a
coss
said
the
man
a
short
distance
from
hence
the
road
becomes
stony
and
continues
so
till
you
are
above
the
pass
take
advantage
of
it
and
he
fell
in
among
the
others
the
men
were
silently
warned
to
be
at
their
posts
and
each
man
or
two
men
as
it
was
necessary
placed
himself
close
to
the
one
to
whom
he
had
been
assigned
by
designed
obstructions
in
front
the
bullocks
belonging
to
the
sahoukar
with
their
attendants
were
brought
immediately
about
the
cart
in
which
he
rode
and
the
whole
being
gathered
into
one
place
were
the
easier
to
be
secured
the
preparations
again
roused
me
and
i
grasped
the
handkerchief
firmly
thinking
every
moment
that
the
signal
was
about
to
be
made
but
we
still
crept
on
at
a
slow
pace
for
the
road
was
narrow
and
lined
by
thorny
bushes
and
the
men
in
front
proceeding
as
slowly
as
possible
we
were
kept
exactly
in
our
proper
place
and
expected
every
moment
to
reach
the
spot
as
we
approached
the
small
hills
the
jungle
became
pretty
thick
and
appeared
doubly
so
by
the
moonlight
and
we
passed
many
places
where
i
thought
the
deed
might
have
been
done
with
advantage
but
i
was
wrong
for
the
lughaes
had
selected
an
admirable
one
a
man
came
from
the
front
whispered
a
few
words
to
my
father
and
again
went
on
this
increased
my
anxiety
we
crossed
a
small
hollow
ascended
a
bank
and
below
us
i
saw
what
i
was
sure
was
the
place
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
were
high
and
steep
covered
with
thick
underwood
matted
by
trailing
creepers
a
few
higher
trees
nearly
met
over
its
bed
in
which
could
be
just
discerned
a
small
thread
of
water
looking
like
a
silver
snake
as
the
moon
rays
fell
on
it
through
the
dark
foliage
a
hundred
thieves
might
lie
there
thought
i
and
who
could
ever
know
the
fate
of
a
traveller
who
might
so
easily
be
surprised
in
such
a
spot
i
was
roused
from
my
train
of
thought
by
my
father
as
he
called
out
hooshiaree
caution
this
was
the
preparatory
signal
he
went
to
the
side
of
the
cart
and
represented
to
the
sahoukar
that
we
had
reached
the
stream
and
that
the
bank
was
so
steep
and
the
bed
so
stony
that
he
must
get
out
and
walk
over
to
the
other
side
if
no
further
this
was
quite
sufficient
the
man
got
out
and
after
seeing
the
cart
safely
down
the
steep
bank
was
preparing
to
follow
himself
the
whole
scene
is
now
before
me
the
bullocks
and
their
drivers
with
the
thugs
were
all
in
a
confused
group
in
the
bed
of
the
little
stream
the
men
shouting
and
urging
on
their
beasts
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
man
had
a
thug
close
to
him
awaiting
the
signal
they
were
only
a
few
feet
below
us
and
the
stream
was
so
narrow
that
it
was
with
some
difficulty
all
could
stand
in
its
bed
especially
when
the
cart
reached
the
bottom
above
stood
my
father
hoosein
and
myself
the
sahoukar
one
of
his
servants
and
several
other
thugs
i
was
eagerly
waiting
the
signal
i
tightly
grasped
the
fatal
handkerchief
and
my
first
victim
was
within
a
foot
of
me
i
went
behind
him
as
being
preferable
to
one
side
and
observed
one
of
the
other
thugs
do
the
same
to
a
servant
the
sahoukar
moved
a
step
or
two
towards
the
road
i
instinctively
followed
him
i
scarcely
felt
that
i
stirred
so
intensely
was
i
observing
him
jey
kalee
shouted
my
father
it
was
the
signal
and
i
obeyed
it
as
quick
as
thought
the
cloth
was
round
his
neck
i
seemed
endued
with
superhuman
strength
i
wrenched
his
neck
round
he
struggled
convulsively
for
an
instant
and
fell
i
did
not
quit
my
hold
i
knelt
down
on
him
and
strained
the
cloth
till
my
hand
ached
but
he
moved
not
he
was
dead
i
quitted
my
hold
and
started
to
my
feet
i
was
mad
with
excitement
my
blood
boiled
and
i
felt
as
though
i
could
have
strangled
a
hundred
others
so
easy
so
simple
had
the
reality
been
one
turn
of
my
wrists
had
placed
me
on
an
equality
with
those
who
had
followed
the
profession
for
years
i
had
taken
the
first
place
in
the
enterprise
for
i
had
killed
the
principal
victim
i
should
receive
the
praise
of
the
whole
band
many
of
whom
i
was
confident
had
looked
on
me
as
only
a
child
i
was
roused
from
my
reverie
by
my
father
you
have
done
well
he
said
in
a
low
and
kind
voice
you
will
receive
the
reward
of
this
soon
now
follow
me
we
will
go
to
the
grave
ere
this
the
bodies
have
been
collected
and
i
myself
must
see
that
they
are
properly
disposed
of
there
will
be
a
noise
about
this
business
and
it
will
need
great
exertion
for
us
to
get
out
of
the
road
we
are
now
travelling
i
followed
him
we
descended
into
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
were
led
to
the
grave
by
one
of
the
men
others
bearing
the
body
of
the
sahoukar
followed
we
passed
up
the
bed
of
the
stream
for
a
short
distance
and
near
the
mouth
of
a
small
nulla
the
bed
of
which
was
dry
a
number
of
the
men
were
standing
the
grave
asked
my
father
it
is
up
there
said
one
you
will
have
to
creep
and
the
thorns
are
very
bad
it
matters
not
he
replied
and
we
entered
the
place
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
were
perhaps
two
or
three
yards
high
and
the
bed
was
so
narrow
that
but
two
persons
could
advance
abreast
the
creepers
and
trees
were
matted
overhead
and
the
sides
so
thick
that
it
was
impossible
that
any
one
could
have
got
down
from
above
the
tangled
character
of
the
spot
increased
as
we
proceeded
until
it
became
necessary
to
free
our
clothes
from
the
thorns
which
caught
us
at
every
step
in
a
few
moments
we
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
after
creeping
almost
on
all
fours
through
a
hole
which
had
apparently
been
forced
through
the
underwood
we
came
upon
the
grave
there
was
only
one
it
occupied
almost
the
entire
breadth
of
the
stream
it
was
very
deep
and
the
earth
or
rather
sand
had
been
thrown
out
on
each
end
the
lughaees
were
sitting
there
sharpening
stakes
cut
from
the
jungle
but
they
could
scarcely
be
seen
from
the
darkness
of
the
place
which
the
thick
wood
above
only
partially
allowed
the
moonbeams
to
penetrate
they
were
conversing
in
a
low
tone
in
the
slang
of
the
band
which
i
had
not
learned
my
father
spoke
to
them
or
rather
to
their
leader
you
have
had
your
wits
about
you
he
said
and
we
will
think
well
of
you
when
we
make
the
distribution
this
is
a
grave
that
even
a
jackal
could
not
discover
again
i
say
peer
khan
you
have
done
this
properly
and
it
is
well
i
have
seen
it
that
i
may
speak
of
you
as
you
deserve
but
you
must
be
quick
the
night
advances
it
is
finished
khodawund
replied
the
man
we
do
but
wait
for
another
body
which
they
say
is
coming
and
the
filling
up
will
be
done
immediately
as
he
spoke
the
body
of
the
sahoukar
was
brought
up
by
three
men
who
railed
at
it
for
its
weight
it
is
their
wont
he
said
do
not
speak
to
them
only
watch
what
they
do
for
you
must
see
all
that
you
may
be
fully
acquainted
with
your
duties
i
was
silent
the
corpse
was
dragged
to
the
brink
and
thrown
in
as
also
that
of
the
servant
who
had
been
killed
close
to
the
sahoukar
incisions
were
made
in
their
abdomens
and
sharpened
stakes
driven
through
them
were
it
not
for
the
precaution
you
see
said
my
father
the
ground
might
swell
and
the
jackals
would
drag
out
the
bodies
in
this
way
however
it
is
impossible
when
all
was
finished
quantities
of
stones
which
had
been
collected
were
thrown
upon
the
bodies
afterwards
thorns
and
the
whole
was
covered
up
with
sand
which
was
carefully
smoothed
i
think
this
will
do
jemadar
sahib
said
peer
khan
we
may
now
leave
the
place
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
will
come
here
to
look
for
the
séthjee
or
his
people
and
the
has
seen
how
cleverly
we
have
done
our
work
enough
said
i
i
shall
know
how
to
act
as
a
lugha
myself
should
i
ever
need
it
my
father
beckoned
me
to
follow
him
i
stayed
to
see
some
dry
sand
thrown
over
the
place
and
proceeded
with
the
others
the
hole
in
the
underwood
made
by
us
was
closed
up
with
great
care
and
a
branch
of
a
bush
being
broken
off
and
trailed
after
him
by
the
hindmost
man
obliterated
every
footmark
in
the
dry
sand
of
the
nulla
chapter
vii
the
rest
of
the
band
with
the
cart
and
laden
bullocks
had
proceeded
some
way
before
we
overtook
them
we
passed
through
a
thin
jungle
for
some
distance
emerging
from
which
we
found
ourselves
on
a
wild
bare
plain
here
and
there
studded
with
straggling
brushwood
we
all
collected
together
and
lighting
fires
the
hooka
passed
round
and
each
one
related
his
achievement
and
gloried
in
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
division
of
the
booty
we
had
acquired
to
arrange
our
future
proceedings
was
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
as
it
was
necessary
to
get
past
bassim
where
the
sahoukar
had
friends
and
his
cart
and
bullocks
might
possibly
be
recognized
in
the
town
my
father
advice
was
to
travel
till
daylight
and
then
to
withdraw
to
one
side
of
the
road
as
far
from
observation
as
possible
to
remain
there
as
long
as
we
could
and
then
to
push
on
beyond
bassim
at
this
halt
too
there
was
to
be
a
grand
division
of
the
spoil
at
least
as
much
of
it
as
could
be
divided
and
hoosein
party
was
to
separate
from
us
and
pursue
their
road
in
the
best
way
they
could
in
the
direction
which
has
been
pointed
out
to
them
accordingly
we
again
started
and
after
passing
some
villages
halted
about
sunrise
at
some
distance
from
the
road
near
a
grove
of
trees
in
which
there
was
a
well
of
water
before
the
men
betook
themselves
to
cooking
their
meal
after
the
march
they
were
all
assembled
and
the
quantity
of
goor
having
been
brought
the
ceremony
of
the
tupounee
was
performed
as
i
have
before
described
i
was
now
entitled
to
a
seat
on
the
blanket
with
the
other
bhuttotes
i
was
their
equal
the
ceremony
ended
i
untied
the
knot
of
my
handkerchief
as
directed
by
my
father
and
taking
out
the
piece
of
silver
presented
it
with
some
rupees
to
my
gooroo
touching
his
feet
at
the
same
time
in
reverence
this
was
the
last
of
my
ceremonies
of
initiation
i
was
a
bhuttote
had
fairly
killed
my
man
and
held
myself
to
be
the
equal
of
any
of
my
associates
after
this
my
father
and
hoosein
brought
forth
all
the
plunder
of
our
late
enterprise
it
was
magnificent
there
was
a
good
quantity
of
gold
and
silver
in
money
but
the
principal
valuables
were
the
jewels
which
the
sahoukar
was
taking
to
hyderabad
for
sale
and
the
cloths
and
brocades
on
the
bullocks
they
were
of
the
richest
description
the
distribution
of
these
was
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
and
it
was
impossible
to
satisfy
every
one
besides
the
pearls
and
diamonds
would
have
lost
a
great
deal
of
their
value
by
being
divided
among
the
men
so
it
was
agreed
to
share
the
ready
money
cooking
utensils
and
other
effects
of
the
sahoukar
also
the
least
valuable
cloths
into
two
equal
portions
as
nearly
as
possible
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
men
of
each
band
that
my
father
was
to
have
charge
of
the
jewels
which
he
was
to
sell
at
hyderabad
to
the
best
advantage
as
also
of
the
most
valuable
cloths
and
that
the
proceeds
of
these
were
not
to
be
divided
until
we
again
reached
our
place
of
rendezvous
the
division
of
the
ready
money
upwards
of
three
thousand
five
hundred
rupees
gave
to
each
man
a
considerable
sum
enough
at
any
rate
to
support
him
for
some
time
the
more
especially
as
the
share
of
the
former
booty
was
not
nearly
expended
for
every
man
lived
as
frugally
as
possible
and
all
seemed
intent
upon
vying
with
each
other
as
to
who
should
have
the
largest
share
at
the
general
division
nay
many
even
denied
themselves
the
meanest
luxuries
and
it
was
not
uncommon
to
see
a
man
eating
his
cakes
without
ghee
or
anything
but
pure
water
bhudrinath
however
one
of
the
most
skilful
of
the
band
was
a
complete
exception
to
what
i
have
said
he
was
a
short
stout
active
fellow
a
man
who
aspired
to
be
a
jemadar
and
with
some
reason
i
have
mentioned
him
before
as
the
bearer
of
the
sacred
pickaxe
he
was
one
of
the
most
enterprizing
among
us
and
had
conducted
small
expeditions
in
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
those
who
had
intrusted
him
with
them
it
was
curious
to
see
that
man
eat
he
consumed
every
day
that
he
could
get
it
two
seers
of
flour
made
into
cakes
a
quarter
of
a
seer
of
ghee
clarified
butter
and
a
large
pot
of
milk
containing
upwards
of
a
seer
it
seemed
impossible
that
one
man
could
demolish
the
pile
of
cakes
when
he
had
baked
them
and
fairly
sat
down
to
eat
them
but
one
by
one
they
disappeared
accompanied
by
such
draughts
of
water
as
would
alone
have
filled
any
ordinary
person
towards
the
end
of
the
pile
however
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
jaws
could
hardly
perform
their
office
and
it
was
almost
painful
to
behold
the
distension
of
his
stomach
he
would
stretch
himself
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
get
up
and
stroke
down
the
mass
collected
apparently
from
his
throat
downwards
and
again
essay
to
finish
what
remained
and
after
many
attempts
he
would
sometimes
succeed
often
have
i
seen
two
or
more
village
dogs
sit
opposite
to
him
during
the
consumption
of
the
mountain
of
cakes
looking
wistfully
at
it
in
the
hope
that
a
portion
of
each
as
he
ate
it
might
be
thrown
to
them
watching
and
envying
every
mouthful
as
it
passed
into
the
apparently
insatiable
maw
but
in
vain
sometimes
bhudrinath
would
divide
the
last
two
or
three
cakes
between
them
when
every
means
of
eating
more
had
been
tried
and
had
failed
but
it
was
oftener
that
desire
of
eating
predominated
he
would
appear
on
the
point
of
gratifying
the
dogs
expectations
nay
would
even
break
a
piece
off
and
hold
it
in
his
hand
as
if
offering
it
the
dog
would
move
towards
him
but
the
coveted
morsel
disappeared
as
the
rest
had
done
and
he
would
return
to
his
expectant
station
to
resume
a
watch
which
too
often
ended
in
disappointment
we
often
jeered
him
on
his
enormous
consumption
of
food
but
he
used
to
declare
that
nothing
under
the
daily
allowance
i
have
mentioned
could
satisfy
him
or
enable
him
to
perform
his
duty
our
encampment
broke
up
towards
evening
friends
were
seen
embracing
each
other
and
wishing
mutual
success
at
length
they
all
departed
we
watched
them
over
the
brow
of
an
eminence
not
far
off
and
then
started
ourselves
leaving
the
beaten
road
to
bassim
we
struck
off
into
one
to
the
left
and
as
it
promised
to
lead
to
some
large
town
we
followed
it
as
well
to
avoid
discovery
as
to
court
new
adventures
by
the
light
of
a
bright
moon
we
travelled
most
of
the
night
passing
through
a
dreary
country
in
many
parts
covered
with
jungle
and
never
entering
a
village
save
to
ask
the
road
or
to
get
fire
to
light
our
hookas
indeed
we
were
often
repulsed
in
this
there
appeared
to
be
a
general
dread
of
robbers
and
the
walls
and
gates
were
usually
manned
by
armed
men
on
the
intimation
of
our
approach
being
given
by
the
dogs
as
we
passed
but
no
questions
were
asked
us
as
to
who
we
were
or
where
we
were
going
although
perhaps
our
numbers
might
have
excited
suspicion
in
this
manner
and
without
knowing
where
the
road
we
had
taken
would
lead
us
we
travelled
for
some
days
and
as
we
had
purposely
avoided
the
principal
roads
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
we
should
meet
with
anything
in
the
way
of
adventure
or
with
any
travellers
whom
we
could
entice
into
our
society
at
last
we
came
upon
a
broader
road
than
that
on
which
we
had
been
travelling
and
as
we
had
left
every
danger
from
our
late
deed
far
behind
us
we
determined
to
follow
it
in
the
hope
that
it
would
lead
us
towards
hyderabad
or
some
large
village
in
its
direction
from
whence
we
could
get
upon
a
road
and
carry
on
our
vocation
as
it
was
we
had
gained
a
respectable
booty
even
for
a
whole
season
but
scarcely
two
months
had
passed
and
we
could
not
afford
to
go
on
so
far
as
hyderabad
in
inactivity
the
road
led
us
on
for
some
hours
till
large
mango
groves
with
here
and
there
the
white
top
of
a
hindoo
temple
peeping
over
them
gave
us
intimation
that
we
were
approaching
a
place
of
consequence
it
turned
out
to
be
the
town
of
oomerkhér
a
wealthy
place
surrounded
with
most
luxuriant
cultivation
of
wheat
and
other
descriptions
of
grain
it
will
be
our
own
fault
said
my
father
if
we
find
not
some
game
here
having
encamped
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
the
sothaees
must
carefully
pass
through
the
bazaars
and
this
evening
may
bring
us
booty
enough
to
recompense
us
for
staying
here
the
duty
of
a
sotha
was
one
which
i
had
also
to
learn
men
were
even
more
proud
of
excelling
in
it
than
in
that
of
a
bhuttote
for
it
required
the
greatest
tact
and
powers
of
dissimulation
ability
to
support
characters
and
disguises
a
smooth
tongue
and
polite
demeanour
bhudrinath
was
one
who
united
all
in
an
eminent
degree
he
was
a
short
stout
active
man
as
i
have
mentioned
but
extremely
handsome
and
with
a
most
winning
manner
it
was
his
constant
boast
that
he
never
marked
out
a
victim
whom
he
did
not
strangle
with
his
own
hands
we
passed
through
the
town
describing
ourselves
as
merchants
from
hindostan
and
as
the
bales
of
cloths
when
stopped
by
the
collector
of
tolls
were
readily
shown
by
my
father
and
the
duty
demanded
on
them
cheerfully
paid
our
assertion
was
credited
we
were
civilly
treated
by
the
authorities
and
shown
an
excellent
piece
of
ground
for
our
encampment
now
dress
yourself
in
your
best
clothes
said
bhudrinath
and
come
with
me
into
the
town
remember
your
father
is
a
merchant
you
are
a
jemadar
commanding
his
escort
i
am
a
respectable
person
belonging
to
you
we
will
take
with
us
peer
khan
who
although
a
lugha
is
an
excellent
sotha
and
a
respectable
fellow
when
he
is
dressed
and
armed
and
it
is
hard
if
we
do
not
pick
up
somebody
our
meal
was
soon
cooked
and
eaten
and
after
carefully
attiring
ourselves
we
set
off
into
the
town
to
seek
for
adventures
it
astonished
me
to
see
the
indifference
with
which
the
practised
hands
proceeded
considering
the
object
they
had
in
view
for
to
me
there
was
as
much
excitement
in
this
as
in
what
i
had
already
learned
and
practised
i
confess
our
appearance
was
remarkable
i
was
very
noticeable
from
my
dress
and
arms
which
were
of
the
richest
description
consistent
with
the
appearance
i
had
assumed
my
face
then
much
fairer
than
it
is
now
sahib
with
a
mustachio
already
well
formed
and
a
figure
which
though
perhaps
somewhat
slender
gave
promise
of
future
strength
and
power
contrasted
with
my
companions
i
felt
i
was
superior
to
them
in
appearance
and
a
little
pardonable
vanity
gave
me
an
air
and
swagger
which
were
not
unfitting
the
military
profession
i
had
set
up
we
entered
the
town
and
betook
ourselves
to
the
chowree
where
the
kotwal
and
some
respectable
persons
were
sitting
surrounded
by
a
few
armed
men
as
is
usual
as
we
passed
by
them
we
were
invited
to
enter
and
received
with
great
politeness
i
was
placed
in
the
seat
of
honour
by
bhudrinath
who
took
his
station
at
some
distance
a
desultory
conversation
began
my
father
name
was
asked
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
had
brought
for
trade
who
we
were
and
in
short
the
general
object
of
our
journey
by
as
they
told
us
an
unfrequented
road
at
least
from
hindostan
the
tone
in
which
this
question
was
asked
seemed
to
me
so
suspicious
that
i
thought
for
an
instant
we
were
suspected
and
i
was
endeavouring
to
frame
a
reply
when
bhudrinath
stopped
me
i
represent
said
he
addressing
the
man
who
had
asked
the
question
that
we
were
set
astray
at
that
abode
of
unsainted
people
nagpoor
either
with
a
view
to
deceive
us
or
god
knows
it
may
be
so
i
have
heard
of
such
things
perhaps
of
robbing
us
persons
from
whom
we
asked
information
told
us
the
best
and
most
frequented
road
was
by
this
place
and
truly
the
town
you
have
the
fortune
to
dwell
in
is
a
place
of
great
beauty
and
fertility
and
is
evidently
in
the
hands
of
a
most
wise
governor
and
one
who
protects
his
people
how
jemadar
sahib
have
i
not
said
truly
indeed
said
i
you
have
and
the
kindness
we
have
as
yet
met
with
shows
that
the
servants
of
the
governor
are
worthy
of
their
master
truly
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
the
town
is
prosperous
and
beautiful
in
such
hands
and
such
is
the
mellifluous
speech
of
the
kotwal
that
we
are
impressed
with
the
greatest
opinion
of
the
discernment
of
the
exalted
person
who
has
selected
him
may
your
condescension
never
diminish
said
the
kotwal
your
slave
is
not
worthy
of
these
encomiums
he
is
less
than
the
least
if
my
lord
could
but
see
the
dispenser
of
benefits
under
whose
beams
he
lives
he
would
indeed
say
that
the
court
of
hyderabad
is
worthy
of
being
compared
with
any
in
hindostan
as
having
formed
such
a
pattern
of
excellence
well
said
i
we
shall
only
be
too
glad
to
lay
our
nuzzurs
at
the
feet
of
this
patron
of
yours
and
no
doubt
we
shall
see
in
him
a
pattern
of
noblemen
a
specimen
of
what
we
may
expect
to
see
at
the
capital
of
the
dukhun
when
may
we
hope
to
be
admitted
to
the
presence
in
the
evening
after
prayers
replied
our
acquaintance
it
is
then
that
justice
is
dispensed
to
these
poor
unbelieving
cultivators
and
the
durbar
is
enlivened
by
the
presence
and
heavenly
music
of
a
set
of
whom
my
lord
has
brought
with
him
from
the
city
we
will
come
said
i
and
i
pray
you
to
give
your
lord
notice
that
we
have
accepted
your
invitation
to
visit
him
nay
that
we
are
desirous
of
paying
our
respects
to
him
as
i
finished
speaking
an
elderly
man
of
decent
appearance
had
entered
the
chowree
he
was
a
hindoo
and
looked
like
a
merchant
he
demanded
in
rather
a
peremptory
tone
a
place
to
rest
in
declaring
that
if
he
did
not
get
it
immediately
he
would
go
and
complain
to
the
ruler
of
the
town
the
spirit
of
the
old
kotwal
seemed
to
be
roused
by
the
behaviour
and
he
declared
in
round
terms
that
he
would
not
give
a
foot
of
ground
or
an
empty
shop
without
he
was
civilly
asked
look
you
gentlemen
said
he
to
us
i
ask
you
to
decide
between
us
i
swear
by
the
prophet
i
care
no
more
than
a
snap
of
my
fingers
for
him
i
have
seen
twenty
thousand
better
and
if
he
goes
to
complain
why
let
him
go
he
will
be
driven
from
the
presence
with
stripes
people
like
him
come
in
hundreds
every
day
and
who
can
trouble
themselves
in
looking
after
them
you
and
your
master
may
be
the
portion
of
the
devil
said
the
old
merchant
ever
since
i
have
entered
the
territories
of
the
nizam
i
have
been
treated
in
this
manner
but
it
is
only
what
i
have
heard
before
not
a
night
have
i
passed
without
an
alarm
of
thieves
and
god
knows
if
i
had
any
protection
i
would
rather
lie
outside
your
wretched
walls
than
in
the
zenana
of
your
amil
himself
your
bunneas
are
rascals
i
am
refused
grain
at
nearly
double
the
price
i
paid
yesterday
i
am
refused
shelter
at
night
in
god
name
what
am
i
to
do
gentlemen
cried
he
to
us
what
am
i
to
do
bhudrinath
answered
as
i
was
going
to
speak
and
to
my
astonishment
angrily
what
would
you
have
o
discontented
man
i
suppose
some
place
has
been
offered
to
you
and
you
have
thought
it
not
good
enough
or
are
you
drunk
with
opium
or
has
hunger
after
your
journey
spoilt
your
temper
go
betake
yourself
to
the
bazar
be
thankful
that
you
can
get
any
place
and
if
no
one
will
shelter
you
lie
in
the
street
bethink
yourself
that
many
a
better
man
has
done
so
before
you
the
man
stood
aghast
he
looked
first
at
us
then
at
the
kotwal
and
his
men
while
expressions
of
delight
at
his
discomfiture
ran
through
the
kotwal
party
well
said
proper
fellows
he
ought
to
be
turned
out
of
the
village
at
last
without
saying
a
word
he
threw
down
his
turban
and
ran
out
bellowing
as
loud
as
he
could
we
all
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
that
is
a
queer
fellow
said
i
to
the
kotwal
i
doubt
not
you
have
often
such
to
plague
you
but
send
for
him
back
we
will
make
him
ashamed
of
himself
and
i
will
beg
you
to
give
him
a
place
to
stay
in
as
you
will
replied
he
but
for
your
intercession
i
should
not
have
troubled
myself
about
him
many
such
have
i
to
deal
with
one
day
a
fellow
comes
swearing
he
is
cheated
by
every
one
another
that
he
can
get
nothing
to
eat
when
perhaps
both
are
too
stingy
to
buy
another
that
he
has
no
shelter
when
he
will
not
pay
the
trifle
demanded
by
the
bunnea
for
the
use
of
his
shop
again
a
third
must
have
every
delicacy
to
be
found
in
a
city
and
he
is
furious
because
he
can
not
get
them
when
if
they
were
all
before
him
he
could
not
afford
to
buy
one
in
short
sirs
there
is
no
end
to
the
fancies
foolishnesses
and
i
may
say
tyranny
of
travellers
and
who
think
me
i
suppose
to
possess
superhuman
power
and
to
have
jins
genii
at
my
command
to
bring
them
whatever
their
foolish
ideas
may
desire
you
have
indeed
no
easy
situation
and
to
please
every
one
is
impossible
said
i
but
here
comes
the
merchant
and
he
entered
take
up
your
turban
good
fellow
said
the
kotwal
and
do
not
be
angry
you
are
no
child
to
be
quarrelling
with
decent
people
have
you
never
travelled
before
that
you
should
be
angry
and
throw
dust
on
our
beards
in
this
manner
in
god
name
take
up
your
turban
and
do
some
one
of
you
go
and
see
that
the
good
man
gets
a
place
for
himself
the
man
looked
irresolute
for
an
instant
then
took
up
the
turban
and
walked
sulkily
out
accompanied
by
the
person
desired
to
attend
him
bhudrinath
gave
me
a
sign
and
we
took
our
leave
we
had
scarcely
got
out
when
he
said
that
man
is
ours
now
see
how
i
will
manage
him
i
dare
say
he
has
but
few
persons
with
him
and
he
will
be
easily
disposed
of
we
kept
our
eye
on
him
and
his
attendant
and
watched
him
take
possession
of
a
shed
of
wretched
appearance
with
many
symptoms
of
dissatisfaction
we
loitered
purposely
till
we
saw
that
he
was
alone
and
then
went
up
to
him
ram
ram
séthjee
said
bhudrinath
addressing
him
what
a
place
is
this
they
have
put
you
into
after
all
not
fit
for
hogs
to
lie
in
that
rascally
kotwal
for
all
his
smooth
tongue
is
an
arrant
knave
i
warrant
and
i
have
heard
continued
he
lowering
his
voice
that
he
has
in
his
employ
a
number
of
thieves
whose
business
it
is
to
cut
away
travellers
from
under
their
heads
at
night
and
when
the
poor
man
goes
to
complain
in
the
morning
he
is
beaten
out
of
the
village
did
we
not
hear
so
jemadar
sahib
yes
indeed
said
i
do
you
remember
the
man
who
met
us
at
the
village
some
coss
from
this
and
warned
us
of
the
thieves
of
oomerkhér
and
said
he
had
been
robbed
of
everything
he
possessed
and
then
driven
out
with
scarcely
a
rag
to
cover
him
it
was
then
that
i
determined
to
encamp
outside
where
we
might
have
our
own
sentinels
and
where
if
we
were
robbed
it
would
be
our
own
fault
god
help
me
i
am
a
lost
man
cried
the
merchant
i
know
not
what
to
do
and
he
beat
his
head
with
his
clenched
hand
in
those
bags
is
all
i
am
worth
in
the
world
i
fled
from
surat
to
save
myself
from
oppression
and
it
appears
that
the
further
i
fly
the
worse
usage
i
meet
it
was
only
two
nights
ago
after
watching
till
my
eyes
nearly
started
from
my
head
from
want
of
sleep
and
not
being
able
to
sit
longer
i
lay
down
and
my
eyes
closed
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
cut
my
bags
from
under
me
and
as
i
awoke
the
thieves
snatched
away
two
of
my
cooking
utensils
and
the
cloth
i
had
about
me
what
could
i
do
had
i
run
after
them
some
fellow
would
have
been
off
with
my
bags
so
i
sat
still
and
screamed
for
help
the
villagers
were
soon
assembled
about
me
and
when
i
told
them
what
had
happened
a
villain
who
called
himself
the
patel
abused
me
for
defaming
his
village
and
i
was
actually
thrust
without
the
gates
and
left
to
pursue
my
way
in
the
dark
in
momentary
dread
that
i
should
be
pursued
and
perhaps
robbed
and
murdered
oh
my
unhappy
fate
cried
he
what
will
it
not
lead
me
to
fool
that
i
was
to
leave
my
own
country
to
become
the
sport
of
unblessed
brutes
such
as
i
have
met
in
this
wild
country
well
said
bhudrinath
in
a
compassionate
tone
you
have
been
used
very
ill
and
you
ought
to
go
and
complain
to
the
hakim
here
report
says
he
is
a
just
man
although
those
under
him
may
be
thieves
and
rascals
no
no
no
cried
the
man
go
and
complain
and
be
fleeced
of
my
last
rupee
the
great
man
would
require
a
nuzzur
and
every
dependent
would
ask
for
one
did
i
dare
to
refuse
my
situation
would
be
worse
than
it
is
now
no
no
i
have
not
been
robbed
as
yet
and
please
god
if
i
could
only
get
out
of
this
town
i
would
attach
myself
to
some
party
of
respectable
persons
going
the
same
road
bhudrinath
turned
to
me
and
took
me
a
few
paces
aside
the
bait
has
taken
said
he
our
net
is
now
around
him
you
must
draw
it
tightly
how
by
inviting
him
to
our
encampment
i
will
propose
it
and
you
shall
pretend
to
disagree
at
first
and
then
after
some
persuasion
consent
do
you
understand
i
do
and
we
turned
back
bhudrinath
again
addressed
him
while
i
turned
away
séthjee
said
he
you
are
a
man
in
misfortune
and
if
we
do
help
you
out
of
this
place
you
will
assuredly
be
robbed
of
everything
you
possess
you
must
come
and
put
up
in
our
encampment
that
is
to
say
if
the
jemadar
sahib
will
permit
it
but
the
truth
is
we
are
very
careful
and
allow
no
one
to
approach
it
as
we
are
escorting
a
merchant
from
benares
to
hyderabad
who
has
a
large
amount
of
goods
with
him
for
god
sake
for
the
sake
of
your
father
and
mother
cried
the
poor
wretch
for
the
sake
of
your
children
intercede
for
me
do
not
suffer
me
to
be
robbed
and
murdered
here
ai
jemadar
sahib
he
said
to
me
catching
me
by
my
dress
you
are
my
father
and
my
mother
a
word
from
you
and
i
am
safe
and
my
poor
merchandize
will
reach
its
destination
god
knows
if
anything
happens
to
me
on
the
road
my
house
will
be
made
desolate
my
employers
will
seize
my
wife
and
children
jemadar
you
can
protect
me
from
this
you
can
save
my
life
from
these
fears
which
make
me
most
wretched
and
are
consuming
my
soul
thooh
good
man
cried
i
spitting
on
the
ground
do
not
be
so
abject
inshalla
i
am
able
by
god
favour
to
afford
protection
to
one
who
is
a
prince
among
merchants
and
you
are
too
poor
to
think
of
in
his
name
follow
us
and
we
will
take
care
of
you
we
are
going
to
hyderabad
ourselves
and
you
can
remain
among
the
servants
do
you
peer
khan
bring
this
man
out
to
us
peer
khan
remained
and
we
returned
to
our
camp
on
the
way
we
determined
that
he
should
die
before
evening
or
when
it
should
become
dusk
and
we
would
then
go
into
the
town
and
visit
the
evening
durbar
of
the
hakim
in
a
short
time
we
beheld
the
merchant
and
peer
khan
with
another
man
driving
two
ponies
apparently
heavily
laden
towards
our
camp
come
this
is
more
than
i
hoped
for
said
my
father
there
are
two
of
them
and
two
ponies
well
laden
must
afford
something
worth
taking
we
can
not
expect
this
to
be
as
profitable
work
as
the
last
but
much
may
come
out
of
it
the
men
approached
and
the
merchant
was
presented
to
my
father
to
your
kindness
he
said
to
me
i
owe
all
i
possess
and
if
these
poor
bags
might
but
be
allowed
to
remain
along
with
the
rest
of
the
merchandize
you
are
protecting
it
would
increase
the
favour
and
they
would
be
safe
surely
i
replied
you
can
unload
your
beasts
and
there
is
the
pile
of
goods
you
can
put
your
bags
on
the
top
of
it
it
was
curious
to
see
the
behaviour
of
the
men
of
the
band
they
appeared
to
have
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
men
had
been
brought
into
the
encampment
they
did
not
evince
the
smallest
savageness
of
demeanour
as
perhaps
might
have
been
expected
on
the
contrary
every
one
was
most
civil
and
attentive
to
the
strangers
one
offered
to
rub
down
the
ponies
another
to
make
a
place
for
cooking
a
third
to
bring
grass
from
the
town
or
anything
they
might
require
for
their
meal
in
a
short
time
we
observed
the
appearance
of
care
and
anxiety
on
the
face
of
the
merchant
to
give
place
to
a
cheerful
expression
and
long
before
evening
both
the
men
were
among
a
knot
of
the
thugs
listening
to
their
stories
and
themselves
relating
their
adventures
little
did
they
think
what
preparations
were
making
and
that
in
a
few
short
hours
they
would
cease
to
be
counted
with
the
living
chapter
viii
meanwhile
a
consultation
was
held
as
usual
at
my
father
tent
and
the
different
parts
were
assigned
to
us
the
office
of
bhuttote
fell
to
me
and
the
merchant
was
delivered
to
my
hands
i
now
experienced
none
of
the
hesitation
which
had
formerly
troubled
my
mind
i
only
longed
for
objects
to
exercise
myself
on
to
perfect
my
hand
in
the
peculiar
knack
it
required
i
had
before
me
the
example
of
those
i
most
looked
up
to
and
to
equal
or
excel
them
was
my
sole
ambition
i
was
determined
to
excel
and
the
excitement
of
the
whole
system
proved
a
powerful
stimulus
in
this
matter
too
i
had
acted
a
prominent
part
as
a
sotha
and
i
began
to
pride
myself
on
my
ingenuity
in
seconding
as
i
had
done
one
so
completely
an
adept
as
bhudrinath
we
agreed
to
put
the
men
to
death
immediately
after
evening
prayer
we
had
in
our
camp
a
boy
about
twelve
years
old
the
son
of
one
of
the
thugs
who
sang
very
beautifully
and
his
father
used
to
accompany
him
on
the
saringee
it
was
our
custom
of
an
evening
after
prayers
to
send
for
the
youth
and
be
entertained
by
his
songs
and
he
sang
so
well
that
he
often
collected
a
considerable
sum
from
among
us
on
this
occasion
he
was
called
and
when
he
had
begun
a
message
was
sent
to
the
merchant
to
come
and
partake
of
our
entertainment
he
came
and
his
servant
also
the
latter
was
a
fine
stout
man
whiskered
and
mustachioed
and
from
the
dialect
he
spoke
i
concluded
him
to
be
a
rajpoot
of
meywar
whose
inhabitants
are
a
noble
race
and
brave
to
a
degree
i
eyed
him
as
he
sat
down
in
his
place
with
a
determination
to
change
the
merchant
for
him
bhudrinath
had
been
allotted
to
him
and
as
i
reflected
on
my
own
powers
and
his
i
felt
assured
that
if
he
was
thought
equal
to
it
i
was
superior
to
him
though
i
might
not
be
considered
so
another
thought
and
my
determination
was
made
i
proposed
the
exchange
to
bhudrinath
as
you
please
said
he
in
a
whisper
but
yonder
is
a
tough
fellow
these
meywaree
rajpoots
are
active
as
panthers
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
not
half
like
the
idea
of
being
allotted
to
him
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
if
i
were
to
fail
there
are
twenty
others
who
would
finish
him
but
do
you
think
yourself
equal
to
him
yes
i
do
not
fear
him
i
have
besides
a
reputation
to
win
and
do
not
care
running
a
little
risk
as
you
will
he
replied
but
you
must
mention
it
to
your
father
i
did
so
the
merchant
was
too
much
absorbed
in
the
boy
song
to
attend
to
us
and
the
servant
was
in
ecstasies
as
it
was
one
of
his
own
country
are
you
able
to
do
it
do
not
try
else
said
my
father
the
man
is
armed
and
has
a
dagger
at
his
girdle
a
sword
i
do
not
fear
but
daggers
are
awkward
things
and
you
might
be
wounded
and
suppose
i
was
i
replied
do
you
think
the
fear
of
that
deters
me
no
no
i
have
taken
this
on
myself
and
i
will
with
your
permission
go
through
with
it
as
you
like
my
son
i
will
not
oppose
you
you
have
a
name
to
gain
and
you
do
well
to
run
some
risk
i
will
observe
you
narrowly
and
be
ready
to
succour
you
should
you
require
it
the
usual
phrase
pan
lao
bring
pan
was
to
be
the
signal
and
as
we
changed
places
myself
and
bhudrinath
i
fancied
the
servant
eyed
us
with
some
suspicion
i
thought
i
saw
him
loosen
the
dagger
in
his
girdle
perhaps
it
was
fancy
and
yet
he
must
have
thought
there
was
danger
he
stood
up
and
looked
round
at
us
and
as
i
contemplated
his
brawny
form
naked
from
the
waist
his
chest
covered
with
hair
and
his
muscular
arms
i
thought
for
an
instant
i
had
overrated
my
strength
but
to
recede
would
have
been
cowardly
the
only
plan
was
to
attack
him
standing
i
moved
towards
him
and
cast
a
keen
look
on
my
father
by
which
i
intended
that
he
should
give
the
signal
as
soon
as
i
had
taken
my
post
he
understood
me
i
had
gained
my
place
the
man
had
just
turned
round
to
look
at
me
and
to
get
out
of
my
way
and
i
was
just
telling
him
not
to
move
as
i
was
passing
on
when
the
signal
was
given
was
it
that
i
was
a
moment
late
or
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fate
of
his
master
or
that
in
reality
he
suspected
that
all
was
not
right
that
he
was
in
danger
i
know
not
but
as
i
threw
the
cloth
around
his
neck
he
drew
his
dagger
to
have
loosed
my
hold
would
have
been
followed
by
instant
death
he
would
have
plunged
it
into
me
and
he
struggled
so
much
that
in
spite
of
my
great
strength
he
almost
succeeded
in
getting
his
other
hand
between
his
neck
and
the
cloth
all
this
happened
in
less
time
than
i
take
to
say
it
my
danger
was
imminent
but
as
fortune
would
have
it
a
thug
attempted
to
seize
the
hand
which
held
the
dagger
this
diverted
his
attention
from
me
for
an
instant
although
half
choked
he
made
an
immense
effort
which
nearly
shook
me
off
and
reached
the
unfortunate
man
he
plunged
the
weapon
into
his
heart
the
man
uttered
a
loud
groan
and
fell
and
the
blood
spouted
forth
over
us
both
but
the
action
had
given
me
a
fresh
hold
i
was
able
to
use
my
knuckles
and
who
could
live
under
the
strength
i
put
forth
the
rajpoot
dying
struggles
were
tremendous
but
i
would
not
quit
my
hold
my
father
rushed
to
me
where
is
the
cord
he
cried
he
will
not
die
in
this
manner
where
is
the
cord
pass
it
about
his
neck
and
let
two
of
you
pull
no
no
i
exclaimed
he
is
nearly
finished
let
me
alone
this
work
is
my
own
no
one
shall
interfere
fortunately
having
thrown
the
man
on
his
face
i
was
able
to
kneel
on
his
back
and
he
was
soon
past
the
ability
to
use
his
dagger
at
last
there
was
one
convulsion
stronger
than
the
previous
ones
and
he
lay
still
he
was
also
dead
my
second
victim
i
arose
breathless
and
exhausted
and
as
i
looked
on
the
prostrate
corpse
before
me
i
felt
indeed
that
there
had
been
danger
that
i
had
escaped
from
a
deadly
struggle
and
that
my
art
had
triumphed
over
strength
almost
beside
the
body
lay
that
of
the
man
who
had
aided
me
who
had
received
a
desperate
wound
all
had
been
so
occupied
with
me
that
they
had
overlooked
the
poor
sufferer
he
was
lying
with
his
face
to
the
ground
groaning
for
god
sake
said
i
turn
him
round
the
wound
is
in
his
stomach
can
nothing
be
done
for
him
some
of
the
men
accordingly
turned
him
but
it
was
plain
to
see
that
there
was
no
hope
of
life
the
blood
poured
in
a
stream
both
from
the
wound
and
from
his
mouth
he
made
several
attempts
to
speak
but
in
vain
he
died
almost
instantly
while
i
was
engaged
in
the
struggle
i
several
times
fancied
that
the
rajpoot
dagger
had
reached
me
as
i
endeavoured
to
avoid
it
by
screwing
my
body
as
far
away
from
him
as
possible
but
the
excitement
was
too
great
for
me
to
feel
the
wound
if
there
was
any
yet
now
on
putting
my
hand
to
my
side
i
found
by
the
blood
on
my
garment
that
i
was
wounded
the
blood
too
was
observed
by
my
father
protection
of
god
he
is
wounded
he
cried
my
son
my
son
did
i
not
warn
thee
did
i
not
bid
thee
beware
of
that
rajpoot
thou
wast
no
match
for
him
my
son
and
now
thou
art
wounded
and
what
can
be
done
and
my
father
sat
down
fairly
overpowered
with
his
emotions
i
felt
that
the
wounds
were
but
scratches
and
hastened
to
open
my
vest
there
said
i
showing
the
wounds
i
said
he
would
do
me
no
harm
and
what
are
these
a
thorn
from
a
hedge
would
have
caused
a
deeper
and
more
painful
one
shookur
khoda
exclaimed
my
father
you
are
not
hurt
after
all
and
the
old
man
eyes
fairly
ran
over
with
tears
as
he
looked
at
the
wounds
but
i
had
feared
the
worst
after
that
horrid
sight
ai
mahomed
thou
wast
a
faithful
servant
the
bodies
of
the
merchant
and
the
rajpoot
were
instantly
stripped
and
removed
to
the
grave
which
had
long
before
been
prepared
for
them
it
was
made
inside
a
small
tent
where
my
father
myself
and
some
others
slept
and
where
it
was
secure
from
observation
i
never
was
more
struck
with
the
despatch
and
ingenuity
of
the
lughaes
than
on
this
occasion
i
had
but
delayed
to
have
my
slight
wounds
dressed
and
to
bathe
and
cleanse
myself
from
the
blood
i
was
covered
with
when
i
went
to
see
the
grave
thinking
to
find
it
still
open
i
was
perfectly
astonished
there
was
no
sign
of
the
earth
having
been
disturbed
the
place
where
the
hole
had
been
dug
had
been
carefully
beaten
down
plastered
over
with
mud
and
but
that
it
was
wet
no
one
could
have
told
that
it
had
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
my
father
sleeping
carpet
and
mine
were
then
laid
over
the
place
now
said
i
to
bhudrinath
let
us
put
on
our
best
clothes
and
visit
the
hakim
will
you
come
too
my
father
no
béta
no
my
son
i
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
all
quiet
here
some
one
must
remain
and
you
and
bhudrinath
have
deserved
your
amusement
so
go
and
take
it
and
here
cried
he
to
some
of
the
thugs
take
your
shields
and
swords
and
accompany
my
son
and
see
that
you
look
like
soldiers
and
not
like
thugs
for
the
night
six
or
eight
were
soon
ready
dressed
in
clean
clothes
and
armed
and
by
this
time
the
moon
having
risen
and
it
being
the
hour
appointed
by
the
kotwal
for
the
evening
durbar
we
set
off
to
the
town
truly
dressed
as
we
were
in
the
handsomest
clothes
we
could
select
we
looked
not
only
soldiers
but
handsome
fellows
each
of
us
had
given
a
knowing
cock
to
his
turban
and
mine
of
the
richest
gold
tissue
passing
several
times
under
my
chin
set
off
my
face
by
giving
me
a
particularly
martial
appearance
my
arms
were
of
the
richest
description
a
sword
with
a
hilt
inlaid
with
gold
its
scabbard
covered
with
crimson
velvet
with
a
ferrule
to
it
of
silver
of
an
open
pattern
which
covered
nearly
half
of
it
in
my
girdle
which
was
a
cashmere
shawl
were
a
or
knife
with
an
agate
handle
inlaid
also
with
gold
and
a
small
jumbea
or
arab
dagger
also
highly
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
i
carried
too
a
shield
of
rhinoceros
hide
the
manufacture
of
sylhet
and
painted
and
gilt
in
the
beautiful
manner
of
hindostan
the
bosses
being
of
silver
richly
chased
and
ornamented
my
dress
was
of
the
finest
muslin
which
showed
my
shape
through
it
to
the
greatest
advantage
and
rich
cloth
of
gold
trowsers
completed
a
dress
at
once
elegant
and
calculated
not
only
to
impress
an
observer
with
my
correct
taste
but
to
convince
him
that
i
was
a
person
if
not
of
rank
of
respectability
bhundrinath
and
peer
khan
appearance
was
something
less
showy
than
mine
but
they
looked
good
and
true
men
and
fair
seconds
to
one
of
my
pretensions
so
we
set
off
to
the
town
and
passing
the
gate
went
to
the
kotwal
chouree
where
we
hoped
to
meet
with
him
or
with
some
one
who
would
direct
us
to
the
durbar
as
it
happened
the
kotwal
was
there
and
relinquishing
his
employment
of
caring
for
travellers
he
accompanied
us
to
introduce
us
we
walked
through
some
of
the
streets
picking
our
way
through
tethered
cattle
and
all
the
abominations
of
a
mahratta
town
and
at
last
reached
a
gateway
around
which
a
number
of
soldiers
were
standing
and
lounging
our
friend
the
kotwal
passed
us
through
them
and
after
traversing
two
open
courts
we
reached
the
place
where
the
entertainment
and
assembly
was
going
on
a
old
man
questioned
us
as
to
who
we
were
to
which
the
kotwal
replied
for
us
that
we
were
respectable
persons
desirous
of
paying
our
respects
to
the
nuwab
sahib
to
which
i
added
that
having
heard
much
of
his
great
name
and
hospitality
we
considered
that
it
would
be
unpolite
to
pass
through
his
town
without
paying
our
compliments
to
him
and
becoming
acquainted
with
so
estimable
a
person
you
are
welcome
said
the
old
man
there
is
nothing
pleases
the
nuwab
sahib
so
much
as
to
see
strangers
wherever
they
may
come
from
and
inshalla
you
will
have
no
cause
to
regret
having
taken
this
trouble
on
the
contrary
i
replied
we
can
not
think
it
trouble
but
an
honour
seldom
allowed
to
such
poor
persons
as
we
are
but
pray
lead
us
to
the
presence
we
ascended
a
few
steps
into
the
hall
where
sat
the
nuwab
surrounded
by
a
number
of
persons
before
him
were
a
group
of
displaying
their
charms
and
entrancing
their
hearers
with
songs
of
persia
and
of
hindostan
our
conductor
bade
us
wait
for
a
moment
and
going
up
to
the
nuwab
said
a
few
words
to
him
intimating
our
arrival
khamoosh
silence
cried
the
nuwab
and
it
was
repeated
by
a
dozen
voices
let
the
strangers
be
admitted
we
were
ushered
on
leaving
our
shoes
at
the
edge
of
the
pure
white
cloth
which
was
spread
over
the
part
of
the
room
which
led
to
the
nuwab
musnud
on
seeing
us
he
made
a
polite
salutation
and
i
stepped
forward
and
enveloping
the
hilt
of
my
sword
in
an
embroidered
scarf
i
had
thrown
loosely
about
my
shoulders
i
presented
it
as
a
nuzzur
kubool
hooa
said
the
old
gentleman
placing
his
hands
upon
it
it
is
accepted
sit
down
near
us
inshalla
we
are
much
pleased
with
your
appearance
and
bid
you
heartily
welcome
to
this
our
poor
durbar
to
be
polite
i
resisted
this
civility
protesting
that
i
was
by
far
too
humble
an
individual
to
allow
myself
so
much
honour
but
he
was
not
to
be
denied
and
accordingly
i
seated
myself
in
the
most
respectful
attitude
with
my
heels
under
me
and
placing
my
sword
and
shield
before
me
in
the
best
manner
to
display
their
beauty
i
turned
to
the
nuwab
who
seemed
to
be
contemplating
my
appearance
mashalla
said
he
to
me
thou
art
a
young
fellow
now
tell
me
who
thou
art
and
who
these
respectable
persons
are
that
accompany
you
i
beg
to
represent
in
your
service
i
replied
that
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor
soldier
a
syud
by
birth
i
have
a
few
men
with
me
for
whom
and
myself
i
am
going
to
hyderabad
to
seek
service
i
am
come
from
hindostan
my
father
who
is
at
our
camp
is
a
merchant
going
to
the
city
with
merchandise
these
persons
i
continued
pointing
to
bhudrinath
and
peer
khan
are
two
of
my
associates
and
being
superior
to
the
rest
i
have
ventured
to
bring
them
to
present
their
nuzzurs
to
the
presence
by
all
means
meer
sahib
we
delight
to
see
good
and
fellows
any
one
such
is
a
pearl
in
the
eye
of
an
old
soldier
like
myself
let
them
be
brought
forward
said
he
to
an
attendant
and
both
advancing
made
the
requisite
salutations
and
presented
the
hilts
of
their
swords
as
i
had
done
the
ceremonies
of
introduction
being
concluded
the
musicians
and
were
desired
to
recommence
and
i
had
a
moment
leisure
to
survey
the
apartment
and
the
scene
before
me
the
apartment
opened
through
three
large
wooden
arches
into
the
which
we
had
crossed
and
between
them
were
hung
large
purdahs
or
curtains
of
english
scarlet
cloth
which
could
be
let
down
as
occasion
required
the
room
was
lofty
and
behind
where
we
sat
the
walls
were
ornamented
with
in
rich
designs
above
on
one
side
was
a
small
gallery
thickly
screened
from
whence
the
inmates
of
the
zenana
could
observe
all
that
was
passing
below
without
being
seen
before
us
the
were
moving
with
their
peculiar
floating
motion
and
singing
while
they
expressed
the
amorous
words
of
their
song
by
their
gestures
another
set
were
sitting
down
by
their
side
waiting
for
their
turn
to
be
called
and
both
were
splendidly
dressed
and
covered
with
jewels
nuwab
hoosein
yar
jung
buhadoor
a
wiry
old
soldier
polite
and
courtly
in
his
manner
was
a
good
specimen
of
the
noblemen
of
the
dukhun
though
perhaps
not
so
effeminately
polished
as
those
of
delhi
yet
he
was
one
whose
appearance
commanded
respect
and
his
bright
keen
eye
and
the
seam
of
a
wound
on
his
right
cheek
showed
that
he
had
seen
and
was
familiar
with
war
his
dress
was
of
plain
dacca
muslin
but
a
string
of
large
pearls
round
his
neck
which
he
used
as
a
rosary
and
the
beautiful
sword
lying
before
him
on
the
carpet
would
prove
to
the
most
casual
observer
that
he
was
a
man
of
rank
and
consequence
he
observed
me
looking
round
and
addressed
me
thus
we
are
in
a
poor
place
here
young
man
but
what
can
be
done
the
duty
of
the
government
must
be
performed
and
we
can
not
carry
our
house
about
with
us
however
we
have
made
the
place
as
decent
as
it
could
be
considering
we
are
in
the
jungle
and
by
the
favour
of
the
prophet
we
have
brought
bright
eyes
and
sweet
voices
with
us
and
we
do
not
lack
amusement
say
what
thinkest
thou
of
our
selection
yonder
is
zora
sitting
down
second
to
few
in
hyderabad
either
for
beauty
of
person
or
sweetness
of
voice
the
other
now
singing
is
one
we
picked
up
on
the
way
hither
but
inshalla
in
a
short
time
she
will
be
fit
company
for
the
other
and
we
shall
take
her
down
to
the
city
with
us
to
astonish
our
acquaintances
the
zora
hearing
her
name
mentioned
turned
round
and
looked
towards
me
i
was
instantly
dazzled
by
her
beauty
she
was
not
so
fair
as
some
of
her
profession
i
had
before
seen
but
if
she
was
not
so
fair
her
features
were
small
and
regular
and
her
large
eyes
when
turned
full
on
me
seemed
to
pierce
me
through
it
was
not
a
quick
glance
but
one
that
was
fixed
slowly
upon
me
and
was
not
withdrawn
i
was
then
young
and
modest
and
i
was
fairly
abashed
she
observed
it
and
turned
round
and
smiled
to
one
of
her
companions
come
said
the
nuwab
smiling
you
are
not
to
steal
the
hearts
of
my
tuwaifs
you
are
a
fellow
and
that
handsome
face
of
yours
will
do
much
mischief
if
i
mistake
not
tell
me
the
news
from
hindostan
report
speaks
of
war
in
that
quarter
and
that
the
mahrattas
and
pindarees
are
arming
why
i
replied
there
are
such
reports
we
heard
that
there
was
service
to
be
got
either
with
sindea
or
holkar
and
that
they
and
the
feringhees
would
soon
be
at
war
but
we
preferred
trying
our
fortune
in
the
dukhun
for
we
heard
the
pay
offered
by
both
was
very
small
to
soldiers
armed
as
we
are
as
they
place
their
principal
dependence
on
the
troops
under
the
francese
generals
by
whom
alone
the
ungrez
feringhees
are
to
be
opposed
ay
said
the
old
nuwab
the
times
of
fair
fighting
are
passing
away
and
the
inventions
of
europeans
are
fast
supplanting
the
bravery
of
the
men
of
hind
god
knows
where
it
will
end
even
at
hyderabad
the
feringhees
have
got
such
a
hold
of
the
place
that
god
knows
whether
they
will
ever
be
driven
out
and
they
train
the
miserable
kafirs
of
telingana
to
fight
in
ranks
and
perform
evolutions
which
are
truly
wonderful
but
the
power
of
alla
is
great
and
they
are
in
favour
with
him
one
comfort
however
said
i
is
that
the
francese
and
ungrez
are
at
bitter
enmity
and
if
there
is
a
fight
one
or
other
by
the
blessing
of
god
must
be
beaten
then
will
be
the
time
for
true
believers
to
rouse
themselves
and
free
their
country
from
the
yoke
of
both
you
talk
like
a
young
boy
this
can
not
be
we
of
hyderabad
are
too
much
beholden
to
the
ungrez
feringhees
for
freeing
us
from
the
demands
of
the
mahrattas
and
the
oppression
of
hyder
ali
and
tippoo
to
quarrel
with
them
and
after
all
i
question
whether
we
could
do
much
against
them
tippoo
fell
and
he
had
the
advice
of
the
francese
in
building
his
fort
god
protect
me
it
was
only
a
mud
wall
before
the
ungrez
you
saw
it
then
i
inquired
yes
indeed
said
he
kindling
i
saw
the
whole
and
if
you
had
also
you
would
have
wondered
to
see
the
soger
battalions
scramble
up
the
breach
like
cats
headed
by
their
officers
in
the
face
of
a
fire
of
guns
and
matchlocks
which
would
have
scattered
the
people
call
sipahees
like
chaff
truly
they
are
something
like
men
and
if
we
of
india
had
fought
like
them
would
they
have
possessed
one
foot
of
ground
inshalla
they
would
not
but
it
is
no
use
regretting
and
now
sikundur
jah
has
made
a
treaty
with
the
ungrez
and
sits
in
his
zenana
like
a
eunuch
leaving
them
to
take
care
of
him
and
his
country
then
you
think
said
i
that
i
have
no
chance
of
service
at
the
city
by
no
means
said
he
you
are
i
think
pretty
sure
of
it
there
are
plenty
of
openings
for
a
fine
fellow
like
you
and
your
appearance
will
take
with
some
of
those
who
command
troops
inshalla
you
might
have
had
it
here
but
my
list
is
full
and
you
are
not
likely
to
separate
from
your
men
no
said
i
that
i
could
not
the
poor
fellows
would
starve
in
a
strange
land
and
having
collected
them
i
must
perform
my
promise
of
taking
them
down
to
the
city
now
you
must
see
my
pride
zora
dance
said
the
nuwab
inshalla
your
heart
must
be
hard
if
she
does
not
make
it
ache
as
she
has
done
that
of
many
a
one
the
group
who
had
hitherto
been
singing
were
desired
to
be
seated
and
zora
prepared
to
stand
up
the
bells
for
her
ankles
were
brought
and
she
tied
them
on
the
musicians
to
accompany
her
tuned
their
instruments
and
after
a
short
prelude
she
stood
up
if
i
had
been
struck
with
her
appearance
sitting
how
much
more
splendid
was
it
now
she
was
not
tall
but
exquisitely
formed
as
far
as
could
be
judged
from
her
peculiar
dress
which
was
so
loose
from
under
her
arms
as
completely
to
hide
her
form
to
her
ankles
but
it
was
of
the
richest
description
it
was
made
of
a
dark
gauze
in
bands
alternately
with
gold
tissue
the
bottom
trimmed
with
gold
tissue
very
broad
as
far
as
her
knees
upon
which
there
was
rich
embroidery
in
gold
thread
and
seed
pearls
around
her
she
had
thrown
with
extreme
grace
a
scarf
of
the
lightest
muslin
and
silver
of
the
same
colour
as
her
dress
so
thin
was
it
that
as
she
moved
it
seemed
almost
to
float
away
from
her
in
the
air
caused
by
her
motion
the
colour
of
the
scarf
round
her
head
in
contrast
with
her
complexion
made
it
appear
much
fairer
than
it
really
was
and
her
large
soft
eyes
still
more
brilliant
and
swimming
the
musicians
began
their
usual
prelude
and
with
it
one
of
companions
a
pretty
girl
the
slow
movements
of
the
dance
after
a
few
turns
she
resumed
her
place
and
zora
herself
like
the
full
moon
emerging
from
a
cloud
sailed
towards
us
with
a
slow
and
graceful
motion
how
shall
i
describe
to
you
sahib
her
exquisite
movements
every
turn
displayed
her
form
to
greater
advantage
and
i
gazed
till
my
soul
was
fairly
entranced
but
how
much
more
was
i
affected
when
she
began
to
sing
having
performed
the
dance
both
the
slow
and
quick
she
ceased
and
after
a
prelude
by
one
of
the
musicians
behind
her
she
broke
out
into
an
impassioned
ghuzul
it
was
one
i
was
very
fond
of
myself
i
listened
till
i
could
have
fallen
at
her
feet
and
worshipped
her
as
a
peri
from
heaven
my
soul
was
so
intoxicated
with
the
blessed
sounds
i
heard
that
i
was
insensible
to
all
around
me
she
at
length
ceased
and
the
nuwab
who
had
been
observing
me
attentively
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
songstress
and
her
dancing
most
wonderful
is
it
i
replied
my
liver
has
become
water
before
her
fascinations
it
is
fortunate
for
me
that
i
am
not
to
live
within
their
influence
or
i
were
lost
for
ever
i
could
forego
fame
and
my
profession
to
lie
at
her
feet
and
dream
away
my
existence
you
talk
like
a
foolish
boy
said
the
nuwab
and
must
not
give
way
to
such
fancies
many
a
man
has
been
ruined
for
ever
by
them
persons
like
her
are
greedy
and
insatiable
of
money
as
we
are
told
of
the
sea
which
swallows
up
everything
that
is
cast
into
it
without
showing
a
sign
on
its
surface
beyond
that
of
the
transient
ripple
can
not
they
love
i
asked
are
they
so
utterly
mercenary
utterly
alas
young
man
i
have
known
and
felt
it
but
let
us
change
the
entertainment
i
have
some
rare
bhyroopeas
with
me
who
arrived
from
hindostan
the
other
day
i
have
but
heard
them
once
and
my
sides
ached
with
laughter
you
no
doubt
are
well
acquainted
with
their
style
yet
it
is
somewhat
new
to
me
they
shall
be
produced
may
your
condescension
increase
nuwab
said
i
truly
your
favour
is
great
on
your
poor
servant
and
of
which
he
is
utterly
unworthy
nevertheless
he
will
not
fail
to
make
known
the
fair
name
and
hospitality
of
hoosein
yar
jung
buhadoor
wherever
his
fate
may
lead
him
which
is
the
only
return
he
can
make
for
it
you
will
prosper
i
hope
he
replied
young
fellows
of
your
appearance
rarely
fail
to
make
friends
but
here
come
the
bhyroopeas
let
us
see
what
new
amusement
they
have
prepared
for
us
something
to
laugh
at
i
doubt
not
they
were
three
in
number
and
twisting
their
faces
into
comical
expressions
so
as
to
cause
the
whole
assembly
to
burst
into
a
simultaneous
fit
of
laughter
one
of
them
stepped
forward
and
said
that
in
the
country
whence
he
came
there
was
once
a
nuwab
a
very
wise
man
who
governed
his
country
as
no
one
had
done
before
and
was
a
lord
victorious
in
war
and
that
if
the
hoozoor
pleased
his
slaves
were
prepared
to
relate
some
of
his
adventures
go
on
said
the
nuwab
we
are
attending
see
that
there
is
nothing
indecent
for
you
are
in
the
presence
of
the
khanum
asteferalla
god
forbid
cried
all
making
their
salutation
towards
the
screen
may
the
favour
of
the
khanum
be
upon
us
and
may
alla
give
her
a
long
life
and
posterity
to
bless
her
inshalla
we
shall
find
favour
in
her
sight
and
take
away
our
garments
filled
with
gold
they
commenced
one
of
the
men
dressed
ridiculously
as
a
child
personated
the
nuwab
the
story
begins
with
his
youth
how
he
is
petted
in
the
zenana
and
the
two
others
changing
their
dresses
to
those
of
females
one
is
his
mother
the
other
his
nurse
the
young
nuwab
is
pampered
spoiled
becomes
unruly
is
declared
to
be
possessed
by
the
shitan
a
moola
is
called
in
and
charms
and
wonderful
potions
prepared
by
the
aid
of
magic
are
administered
the
great
child
screams
and
roars
kicks
his
mother
and
nurse
out
of
the
assembly
upsets
all
about
him
and
the
confusion
and
noise
created
by
all
this
especially
among
the
tuwaifs
made
a
scene
of
fun
at
which
we
all
laughed
heartily
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
men
again
made
their
appearance
and
the
second
act
began
the
child
had
grown
up
to
be
a
youth
and
to
be
fiery
and
uncontrollable
women
wine
horses
and
arms
are
his
enjoyments
reckless
of
everything
he
plunges
into
dissipation
sets
his
parents
at
defiance
runs
into
debt
is
surrounded
by
sharpers
and
parasites
who
despoil
him
of
all
he
possesses
and
he
had
given
himself
up
to
harlots
and
debauchery
and
this
ends
the
second
part
his
father
dies
he
is
now
nuwab
he
is
the
head
of
a
proud
house
has
men
and
soldiers
at
his
command
and
his
territory
to
manage
he
forthwith
kicks
out
his
former
companions
discards
every
one
he
had
formerly
had
near
him
good
and
bad
together
gives
himself
up
to
a
new
set
of
rogues
who
had
preyed
upon
his
father
men
with
hoary
beards
only
the
greater
adepts
in
villany
he
has
a
quarrel
with
a
neighbouring
noble
and
the
two
prepare
for
war
the
troops
are
described
how
they
eat
mountains
and
drink
rivers
and
the
nuwab
himself
as
going
forth
like
a
bridegroom
to
meet
his
bride
like
the
lightning
from
the
or
river
its
bounds
terrible
irresistible
before
whose
glance
men
quail
as
before
a
lion
his
horse
and
arms
the
former
large
of
carcass
small
of
limb
feet
large
and
broad
fleet
as
the
antelope
courageous
as
the
panther
of
the
arms
the
sword
which
wielded
by
his
father
had
cut
through
a
buffalo
skin
and
divided
the
thickest
quilting
he
goes
forth
and
the
fight
commences
the
horses
charge
and
the
nuwab
and
his
enemy
meet
each
is
mounted
on
the
back
of
a
man
they
fight
sword
after
sword
made
of
wood
is
splintered
one
of
the
horses
is
killed
it
is
the
nuwab
he
too
is
killed
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
his
foe
no
he
is
up
again
the
fight
is
renewed
it
is
long
doubtful
fresh
weapons
are
given
by
attendants
at
last
he
is
victorious
alla
akbar
the
victory
is
won
the
enemy
is
routed
then
follows
the
torture
of
the
prisoners
the
rifling
of
the
zenana
there
is
one
slave
beautiful
small
delicate
in
form
an
eye
like
the
gazelle
fair
as
the
beauties
of
room
or
the
fabled
ones
of
england
she
falls
at
his
feet
he
is
captivated
she
conquers
and
the
nika
is
performed
they
live
happily
for
some
time
but
the
fame
of
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
of
a
neighbour
reaches
him
his
soul
is
on
fire
his
former
love
is
neglected
he
proposes
marriage
it
is
accepted
the
bride
comes
home
and
a
deadly
jealousy
ensues
between
the
rival
wives
the
quarrels
of
the
zenana
are
described
and
by
the
shrieks
of
laughter
from
behind
the
screen
it
is
easy
to
believe
how
naturally
all
had
been
described
and
acted
the
nuwab
has
reached
middle
age
he
is
now
a
father
of
a
family
a
respectable
man
a
religious
man
surrounded
by
moolas
who
flatter
him
and
have
usurped
the
places
of
his
former
companions
he
is
as
debauched
as
ever
but
it
is
not
known
he
passes
for
a
just
and
good
man
and
his
durbar
is
described
and
his
judgments
what
was
solomon
compared
with
him
or
hatim
tai
or
lokman
the
wise
and
at
each
enumeration
of
his
virtues
the
assembly
loudly
applauded
and
directed
their
looks
to
the
real
nuwab
who
sat
as
the
spectator
again
the
nuwab
is
shown
old
and
decrepid
worn
out
by
disease
surrounded
by
quacks
from
whom
he
demands
nostrums
to
make
him
young
and
vigorous
his
zenana
is
fuller
than
ever
of
women
who
flatter
his
vanity
tell
him
he
is
as
young
as
ever
he
was
and
yet
are
false
to
him
but
he
has
a
son
who
promises
to
excel
his
father
who
is
a
mejnoon
in
form
a
roostum
in
valour
before
whom
his
father
enemies
are
scattered
like
chaff
from
the
grain
before
the
wind
the
old
nuwab
is
growing
more
and
more
decrepid
and
querulous
his
fancies
and
longings
are
described
in
a
most
laughable
manner
and
as
the
final
event
approaches
he
sinks
into
his
eternal
sleep
sure
of
the
seventy
houris
of
paradise
and
the
eternal
youth
which
is
the
portion
of
true
believers
having
concluded
they
stepped
forward
for
the
largess
promised
well
meer
sahib
said
the
nuwab
to
me
how
like
you
this
have
the
men
done
ill
or
well
said
i
the
works
of
alla
are
wonderful
and
assuredly
these
fellows
are
of
his
especial
handywork
i
have
seen
many
of
their
caste
before
but
never
any
like
these
they
shall
be
well
rewarded
said
the
nuwab
and
yet
despite
of
our
having
laughed
at
the
whole
story
there
is
much
of
a
moral
in
it
and
much
satire
would
that
many
of
the
rising
generation
could
receive
a
lesson
from
it
they
might
become
wiser
and
better
men
ameen
i
replied
my
lord
remarks
are
just
i
did
not
notice
the
satire
when
i
heard
it
but
now
i
feel
it
and
it
is
just
the
night
was
far
advanced
and
requesting
leave
to
depart
i
rose
to
be
gone
i
was
passing
the
tuwaifs
when
an
old
woman
pulled
me
by
the
sleeve
and
said
hurriedly
if
you
seek
an
opportunity
there
is
another
who
desires
one
be
secret
you
shall
hear
more
from
me
my
blood
boiled
i
slipt
a
piece
of
money
into
her
hand
and
departed
chapter
ix
i
said
my
blood
boiled
could
it
be
that
one
so
lovely
one
who
had
kept
company
with
the
nobles
and
men
of
wealth
of
hyderabad
had
seen
aught
to
admire
in
me
who
was
unused
to
courtly
scenes
and
was
even
yet
a
boy
deficient
in
manner
and
address
could
it
be
that
from
my
dress
and
appearance
she
thought
me
rich
one
who
would
squander
my
substance
upon
her
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
my
mind
and
we
had
nearly
reached
our
encampment
without
my
having
interchanged
a
word
with
my
companions
the
silence
was
broken
by
bhudrinath
how
is
this
meer
sahib
said
he
what
has
tied
your
tongue
have
you
nothing
to
talk
about
after
our
night
entertainment
no
remarks
to
make
on
the
beautiful
kunchinee
by
alla
though
it
is
a
mahomedan
oath
i
would
almost
be
content
to
give
up
the
heaven
of
indra
and
turn
moosulman
were
i
sure
of
being
attended
in
the
paradise
of
mahomed
by
a
set
of
houris
just
such
as
she
and
to
think
of
her
belonging
to
that
old
wretch
the
nuwab
and
to
be
buried
in
this
hole
of
a
mahratta
village
when
she
might
have
half
the
nobles
of
hyderabad
at
her
feet
were
she
there
by
alla
i
say
again
it
were
worth
the
while
to
try
and
entice
her
away
from
the
old
sensualist
and
it
would
be
something
to
talk
about
not
to
mention
her
company
on
the
road
and
the
rare
addition
she
would
make
to
our
evening
amusements
why
i
replied
carelessly
the
girl
is
as
you
say
of
surpassing
beauty
and
no
doubt
feels
herself
uncomfortable
in
this
abode
of
swine
yet
to
get
her
away
would
be
no
easy
task
and
what
should
we
do
with
her
when
we
got
her
i
shall
try
and
see
if
her
coming
with
us
is
any
such
marvellous
difficulty
he
rejoined
and
you
know
if
afterwards
there
is
any
pursuit
she
and
the
rest
of
her
people
are
easily
provided
for
now
you
speak
like
a
thug
i
retorted
angrily
for
deny
it
as
much
as
i
would
to
myself
i
could
not
but
feel
that
the
had
more
than
interested
me
and
i
would
sooner
quit
you
all
and
get
back
to
hindostan
the
best
way
i
could
than
that
a
hair
of
her
head
should
be
injured
i
did
but
jest
meer
sahib
you
know
i
am
not
one
who
wars
with
women
except
when
they
come
before
me
in
the
fair
and
lawful
exercise
of
my
vocation
no
if
we
get
the
girl
it
must
be
by
fair
means
and
as
your
father
is
on
many
points
he
is
too
fond
of
a
good
song
and
good
music
to
deny
us
having
her
in
company
so
do
not
mind
what
i
said
and
do
not
go
to
sleep
upon
your
anger
to
your
poor
friend
if
indeed
you
have
any
i
am
not
angry
said
i
though
i
certainly
felt
my
blood
rise
when
you
alluded
to
her
we
will
consider
about
the
rest
in
the
morning
and
if
we
can
but
persuade
my
father
that
the
girl
comes
of
her
own
accord
i
do
not
anticipate
any
objection
but
we
must
be
sure
that
she
will
go
first
and
to
this
end
i
have
a
kind
of
clue
which
may
guide
me
how
did
she
say
aught
to
you
he
eagerly
inquired
no
said
i
how
could
she
in
that
crowd
but
you
know
i
understand
persian
thanks
to
the
old
moola
my
teacher
and
you
do
not
and
from
the
words
of
the
last
plaintive
song
she
sang
and
her
mode
of
expressing
them
i
have
a
shrewd
guess
that
she
is
tired
of
confinement
and
of
her
mate
you
know
the
old
proverb
bu
kubootur
bâz
bu
bâz
pigeons
mate
with
pigeons
and
hawks
with
hawks
well
said
bhudrinath
according
to
that
she
is
more
likely
to
look
to
you
than
to
me
and
you
know
i
am
a
brahmin
therefore
i
leave
her
and
the
matter
to
your
management
i
am
ready
to
assist
when
i
can
be
of
use
inshalla
as
you
people
say
we
shall
make
a
of
the
old
fellow
beard
and
laugh
him
to
scorn
ameen
said
i
we
will
try
at
all
events
and
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
the
course
of
more
upon
this
subject
we
then
separated
for
the
night
and
i
was
glad
peer
khan
and
the
rest
of
the
men
had
been
so
far
behind
us
as
not
to
have
been
able
to
overhear
any
part
of
our
conversation
i
confess
that
as
i
lay
down
to
sleep
i
earnestly
desired
the
success
of
our
scheme
though
as
yet
it
could
hardly
be
called
one
and
though
i
had
in
some
degree
struggled
with
it
i
had
not
been
proof
against
the
fascination
of
the
nor
indeed
was
it
to
be
wondered
at
after
the
words
of
the
old
woman
soon
after
the
morning
prayer
the
leaders
of
the
band
were
assembled
to
see
the
opening
of
the
bags
of
him
who
had
died
the
evening
before
my
father
presided
in
the
assembly
and
one
by
one
they
were
brought
from
the
pile
of
merchandize
we
had
indeed
got
a
prize
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
care
of
them
had
cost
the
man
they
belonged
to
so
much
anxiety
in
each
of
them
among
a
quantity
of
old
clothes
rags
and
old
copper
vessels
were
concealed
small
boxes
filled
with
precious
stones
pearls
small
diamonds
rubies
and
emeralds
and
in
two
of
the
boxes
were
sets
of
ornaments
made
up
and
set
with
jewels
and
two
in
particular
a
bazu
bund
or
ornament
for
the
arm
and
a
or
ornament
for
the
turban
were
particularly
splendid
my
father
who
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
these
matters
pronounced
the
whole
to
be
worth
at
least
fifteen
thousand
rupees
and
offered
the
band
the
alternative
of
distributing
the
whole
in
as
equal
portions
as
he
could
or
of
waiting
till
our
arrival
at
hyderabad
where
they
could
easily
be
sold
for
ready
money
the
latter
after
some
deliberation
was
determined
on
as
had
been
the
case
with
the
former
booty
i
proposed
as
i
knew
that
we
might
perhaps
run
short
of
money
on
the
road
especially
if
we
met
with
no
more
rich
travellers
to
offer
one
of
the
two
ornaments
for
sale
to
the
nuwab
and
as
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
to
take
it
to
him
myself
the
proposal
was
agreed
to
and
i
was
not
without
hope
that
by
some
lucky
chance
i
might
fall
in
with
the
old
woman
who
had
spoken
to
me
the
night
before
and
might
be
able
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
her
which
should
guide
us
in
our
future
plans
so
accordingly
about
noon
i
called
bhudrinath
to
accompany
me
and
we
proceeded
to
the
palace
as
it
was
called
by
the
villagers
by
the
way
we
met
with
our
friend
the
kotwal
but
i
cut
him
short
with
another
time
kotwaljee
for
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
to
have
a
long
story
another
time
my
friend
we
will
pay
you
a
visit
but
at
present
the
matter
we
have
in
hand
is
urgent
and
it
being
past
noon
we
are
afraid
of
being
denied
admittance
and
so
you
must
excuse
us
of
course
said
he
i
will
not
detain
you
and
i
shall
not
fail
to
present
myself
at
your
camp
this
evening
to
receive
your
further
commands
that
means
said
bhudrinath
as
we
moved
on
that
he
expects
a
present
these
worthies
have
been
my
study
for
many
years
ay
said
i
we
must
pay
him
well
and
he
will
be
the
first
to
cry
up
our
praises
should
anything
happen
but
do
you
anticipate
anything
not
i
said
he
i
wish
we
could
always
do
our
work
as
securely
and
get
as
well
paid
for
it
but
here
we
are
at
the
nuwab
gate
an
attendant
at
our
request
took
in
our
names
to
the
nuwab
and
after
a
short
delay
we
were
again
ushered
into
his
presence
and
received
with
the
same
civility
as
we
had
been
the
night
before
after
some
desultory
conversation
i
opened
the
object
of
our
visit

said
i
my
father
pleads
an
attack
of
fever
and
cold
for
not
attending
to
present
his
nuzzur
at
your
feet
and
he
trusts
you
will
pardon
his
seeming
neglect
in
his
behalf
i
have
brought
a
rare
piece
of
jewellery
for
your
inspection
which
he
hopes
may
please
you
and
by
its
purchase
you
will
not
only
materially
assist
him
but
it
will
become
the
property
of
one
worthy
to
possess
and
wear
it
thus
saying
i
produced
the
ornament
for
the
turban
and
laid
it
before
him
he
was
evidently
much
struck
with
its
beauty
and
the
fine
water
of
the
precious
stones
and
after
turning
it
in
every
position
he
could
to
catch
the
exact
light
for
it
laid
it
down
with
a
kind
of
sigh
it
is
indeed
beautiful
and
worthy
of
the
turban
of
bundugan
ali
himself
but
said
he
i
am
too
poor
to
buy
it
its
value
must
be
very
great
no
doubt
said
i
my
grandfather
must
have
paid
handsomely
for
it
but
times
have
altered
with
us
and
we
have
been
glad
to
sell
our
family
property
for
whatever
it
would
fetch
in
this
instance
far
be
it
from
your
slave
intention
to
put
a
price
upon
an
ornament
without
peer
in
its
fashion
yet
methinks
it
would
so
well
become
the
forehead
of
my
lord
that
he
ought
not
to
let
slip
such
an
opportunity
of
possessing
it
to
be
enabled
to
show
it
one
day
at
the
court
of
his
prince
thou
sayest
truly
and
if
i
may
i
will
but
show
it
in
the
mahal
and
see
how
the
persons
of
my
household
like
it
inshalla
they
will
approve
of
it
and
then
we
will
see
if
we
can
come
to
terms
about
it
certainly
said
i
the
time
has
been
when
it
would
have
been
nothing
for
our
house
to
have
presented
a
tray
of
such
to
one
of
my
power
and
rank
but
we
are
reduced
as
i
said
and
are
no
longer
fit
possessors
of
what
we
dare
not
wear
the
nuwab
took
the
jewel
and
went
into
his
zenana
he
was
absent
a
long
time
but
we
could
see
by
his
face
on
his
return
that
it
had
been
approved
of
they
have
looked
at
it
in
a
thousand
ways
and
have
discovered
that
there
is
good
fortune
to
come
with
it
not
that
i
need
any
but
you
know
what
a
parcel
of
old
women
are
said
he
and
now
i
will
ask
what
may
be
the
price
you
know
we
nobles
of
hyderabad
are
not
overburthened
with
money
and
you
must
be
moderate
in
your
demand
why
said
i
i
am
flattered
by
the
opinion
of
those
who
have
seen
it
and
can
only
say
that
my
grandfather
may
his
memory
live
for
ever
paid
so
large
a
sum
for
the
jewel
that
i
am
afraid
to
mention
it
my
lord
must
observe
particularly
its
exquisite
water
he
i
say
collected
the
stones
one
by
one
during
a
long
period
of
his
life
and
they
cost
him
alone
six
thousand
rupees
the
gold
around
them
is
somewhat
more
but
my
father
will
esteem
himself
fortunate
if
five
thousand
rupees
be
given
for
it
it
is
too
much
said
the
nuwab
with
a
sigh
where
have
i
five
thousand
rupees
to
lay
out
in
such
a
bauble
as
this
my
friends
i
have
been
gratified
by
the
sight
of
it
but
to
purchase
it
is
out
of
the
question
the
money
i
have
not
yet
stay
allow
me
to
have
it
valued
by
a
jeweller
and
we
may
perhaps
come
to
terms
by
all
means
said
i
i
have
told
my
lord
no
lie
in
stating
the
price
of
it
but
let
the
jeweller
see
it
he
may
fix
a
smaller
sum
and
such
is
our
urgent
necessity
for
a
little
ready
money
that
perhaps
we
may
be
induced
to
take
something
less
the
jeweller
was
accordingly
sent
for
and
arrived
after
a
short
time
he
was
shown
the
jewel
and
from
the
expression
of
admiration
on
his
countenance
i
could
see
we
had
not
overvalued
it
he
took
it
to
the
light
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
examined
it
in
every
possible
way
at
last
he
returned
and
taking
the
spectacles
from
his
nose
asked
the
price
we
had
fixed
on
it
i
told
him
at
the
time
this
was
made
up
said
he
no
doubt
it
was
worth
the
sum
you
mention
for
the
stones
are
of
rare
water
nevertheless
we
all
know
that
men
can
not
afford
to
expend
money
as
they
used
to
do
and
all
things
considered
perhaps
at
present
four
thousand
rupees
would
not
be
too
much
and
indeed
a
fair
price
it
is
too
little
we
must
be
content
to
sell
other
articles
to
supply
our
necessities
so
nuwab
sahib
said
i
with
our
profound
thanks
for
your
condescension
we
ask
leave
for
our
departure
and
i
took
up
the
jewel
and
arose
stay
said
he
i
offer
you
three
hundred
rupees
more
four
thousand
three
hundred
surely
that
is
sufficient
make
it
five
hundred
i
replied
and
it
is
yours
and
after
much
haggling
on
both
sides
the
price
was
fixed
at
four
thousand
four
hundred
and
fifty
of
this
two
thousand
five
hundred
were
paid
by
the
nuwab
treasurer
in
money
and
for
the
rest
at
my
request
a
bill
was
made
out
by
a
sahoukar
of
the
village
on
hyderabad
and
after
again
offering
our
thanks
to
the
nuwab
we
took
leave
of
him
for
ever
not
a
bad
morning
work
said
i
to
my
companion
as
we
walked
homewards
attended
by
some
of
the
nuwab
soldiers
escorting
the
men
who
carried
the
bags
of
money
the
sight
of
the
coin
will
gladden
my
old
father
heart
and
it
will
be
something
to
divide
among
the
men
who
are
really
in
want
of
money
and
will
keep
them
comfortably
till
we
reach
the
city
even
though
we
should
fall
in
with
no
more
rich
prizes
indeed
you
may
congratulate
yourself
on
your
address
and
good
manners
for
without
them
you
could
not
have
carried
the
matter
off
in
the
way
you
have
done
said
he
now
if
i
though
i
am
a
far
older
thug
had
tried
it
i
should
have
most
likely
failed
for
want
of
a
plausible
story
the
old
fellow
swallowed
the
account
of
your
grandfather
as
if
it
had
been
as
true
as
that
we
are
now
here
by
krishna
thou
art
a
rare
boy
these
matters
sharpen
one
intellect
and
though
i
could
not
deceive
an
unfortunate
traveller
as
you
can
you
see
i
am
of
some
use
at
a
pinch
bhudrinath
all
will
come
in
time
said
he
i
do
not
despair
of
you
after
this
and
if
you
accompany
me
in
my
work
you
will
soon
excel
me
i
think
we
shall
see
i
returned
but
our
errand
is
not
complete
we
have
not
met
the
old
woman
ha
so
that
plan
is
still
in
your
head
cried
he
i
warrant
it
you
dreamt
of
the
kunchinee
last
night
and
your
young
heart
is
all
on
fire
no
said
i
laughing
not
quite
that
but
i
have
some
hope
and
i
shall
return
to
the
kotwal
chowree
after
a
little
time
and
perhaps
the
old
creature
may
be
in
the
bazar
and
may
see
me
shall
i
accompany
you
asked
he
no
said
i
i
think
it
would
mar
the
business
i
will
go
alone
the
presence
of
another
besides
myself
might
prevent
her
if
i
meet
her
from
being
communicative
as
you
will
said
he
as
you
are
determined
to
carry
the
matter
to
the
utmost
you
have
a
better
chance
of
success
than
i
have
and
besides
you
are
a
principal
while
i
could
only
be
an
agent
thus
conversing
we
arrived
at
the
tents
and
dismissing
the
soldiers
and
with
a
handsome
present
i
had
the
bags
moved
into
my
father
tent
who
was
asleep
i
ranged
them
before
him
and
awakening
him
pointed
to
them
he
rubbed
his
eyes
grumbling
at
being
aroused
from
his
slumber
but
they
were
quickly
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
the
bags
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
his
astonishment
as
he
took
them
up
one
by
one
guessing
at
their
contents
what
my
son
ameer
ali
where
hast
thou
got
all
this
there
must
be
five
hundred
rupees
in
each
of
them
one
two
three
four
five
said
he
counting
them
two
thousand
five
hundred
impossible
my
son
what
hast
thou
been
doing
my
brain
is
in
astonishment
where
didst
thou
get
it
there
is
just
what
you
say
father
said
i
each
contains
five
hundred
or
nearly
it
is
the
price
of
the
jewel
you
gave
me
to
sell
which
it
seems
was
worth
more
than
we
thought
for
i
asked
at
a
venture
five
thousand
rupees
and
i
have
brought
you
four
thousand
four
hundred
and
fifty
which
was
as
much
as
i
could
get
here
are
hoondees
for
two
thousand
and
the
rest
is
in
the
bags
as
much
as
you
could
get
boy
cried
my
father
why
thou
hast
done
wonders
mashalla
we
are
rich
indeed
this
is
more
than
i
ever
expected
and
his
eyes
fairly
running
over
with
tears
he
embraced
me
warmly
now
said
i
as
i
have
done
good
service
i
have
in
return
a
favour
to
beg
which
i
hope
my
father
will
grant
and
it
is
a
matter
i
dared
not
settle
without
his
sanction
say
on
said
my
father
i
can
deny
thee
nothing
why
continued
i
there
is
a
tuwaif
of
surpassing
beauty
who
sings
like
a
bulbul
and
who
is
anxious
to
accompany
us
to
hyderabad
i
dared
not
allow
it
without
speaking
to
you
the
old
man
visage
clouded
a
tuwaif
said
he
and
dost
thou
not
remember
my
son
all
the
cautions
i
have
given
thee
against
persons
of
her
condition
and
hast
thou
so
soon
forgotten
them
as
to
get
into
their
company
on
the
first
occasion
which
presented
itself
i
represent
said
i
that
neither
have
i
forgotten
them
nor
have
i
gone
into
her
company
i
saw
her
at
the
nuwab
durbar
last
night
but
did
not
even
speak
to
her
then
how
knowest
thou
that
she
desires
to
go
from
hence
i
have
heard
it
said
i
from
one
who
is
attached
to
her
an
old
woman
who
i
doubt
not
will
be
here
before
the
evening
my
father
shook
his
head
i
do
not
disbelieve
thee
my
son
said
he
but
i
mistrust
thy
young
heart
and
hot
temper
it
is
a
danger
too
great
to
be
encountered
for
once
with
us
and
she
would
get
thee
into
her
toils
and
then
father
duty
and
profession
will
be
alike
forgotten
and
i
should
lose
thee
my
son
which
would
kill
me
do
not
think
so
i
pray
my
father
said
i
there
is
not
the
danger
you
anticipate
she
would
follow
us
and
we
should
see
but
little
of
her
except
we
desired
her
presence
to
sing
to
us
on
the
dreary
evenings
of
our
journey
and
grant
me
this
request
i
pray
you
is
the
only
one
i
have
ever
asked
and
perhaps
i
deserve
something
for
what
i
have
done
hitherto
thou
dost
indeed
he
replied
anything
else
would
have
been
gladly
granted
without
a
demur
on
my
part
however
i
have
confidence
in
thee
my
son
and
therefore
have
it
as
thou
wilt
i
will
not
gainsay
thee
in
the
matter
so
far
therefore
there
was
no
objection
yet
my
heart
smote
me
as
i
thought
on
the
concealment
i
had
made
of
her
being
in
the
pay
and
service
of
the
nuwab
and
that
her
connection
with
him
might
bring
us
all
into
trouble
however
thought
i
women
have
sharp
wits
and
if
she
truly
desires
to
get
away
from
him
she
will
take
her
own
measures
as
soon
as
i
could
therefore
i
set
off
to
the
bazar
and
after
loitering
along
the
row
of
shops
and
purchasing
articles
that
were
really
required
by
us
i
ascended
the
steps
which
led
to
the
chowree
and
was
soon
in
conversation
with
the
kotwal
who
entertained
me
with
the
gossip
of
the
town
and
did
not
fail
to
endeavour
to
impress
me
with
a
high
sense
of
his
power
and
influence
more
than
once
i
was
on
the
point
of
confiding
to
him
my
plan
and
offering
him
a
bribe
to
assist
me
but
i
checked
myself
on
the
consideration
that
he
might
take
my
money
and
afterwards
play
me
false
as
it
happened
however
i
was
not
long
in
suspense
for
i
saw
the
old
woman
in
the
bazar
beneath
me
making
the
best
of
her
way
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
of
the
town
by
which
i
had
entered
so
i
took
my
leave
of
the
worthy
kotwal
begging
him
to
come
to
the
camp
in
the
evening
for
a
reward
for
his
civility
and
exertions
i
had
however
lost
sight
of
the
old
woman
before
i
got
fairly
down
into
the
street
and
following
the
direction
she
had
taken
overtook
her
just
beyond
the
gate
mother
said
i
am
i
he
whom
you
seek
ai
mere
jan
ah
my
soul
have
i
at
last
found
thee
my
prince
surely
i
have
not
ceased
in
my
endeavours
since
last
night
to
meet
thee
i
saw
thee
enter
the
palace
but
my
old
limbs
would
not
carry
me
quick
enough
to
overtake
thee
and
she
threw
her
hands
over
my
head
and
cracked
every
joint
of
her
fingers
by
pressing
them
against
my
temples
are
we
secure
against
observation
here
she
continued
for
i
have
much
to
say
to
thee
and
that
quickly
not
here
i
replied
i
will
go
on
to
our
tents
yonder
and
you
can
follow
me
i
will
wait
for
you
near
them
the
old
woman
hobbled
up
to
me
as
i
stood
under
a
mango
tree
secure
from
observation
quite
out
of
breath
she
sat
down
when
she
had
recovered
herself
she
untied
a
corner
of
the
cloth
about
her
person
and
presented
me
with
a
small
ring
this
said
she
is
from
her
you
know
of
and
for
the
love
of
alla
my
soul
do
you
exert
yourself
for
her
she
is
dying
in
this
place
and
is
subject
to
all
the
torments
the
caprice
of
that
unblest
nuwab
can
think
of
she
is
one
day
in
favour
and
loaded
with
kindnesses
another
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
or
rage
he
deprives
her
of
every
comfort
shuts
her
up
in
a
lonely
room
and
will
not
even
allow
me
to
go
to
her
you
my
son
are
young
and
brave
you
will
not
suffer
her
to
continue
in
this
state
she
who
is
the
pearl
of
hyderabad
who
has
found
favour
in
the
sight
of
princes
and
nobles
for
the
sake
of
alla
exert
yourself
and
she
is
free
and
will
accompany
you
to
the
end
of
the
world
she
has
seen
you
and
your
beauty
has
entered
into
her
soul
and
is
consuming
her
liver
and
between
this
and
her
former
miseries
she
is
in
a
state
of
madness
so
that
even
i
can
not
pacify
her
i
am
ready
mother
said
i
is
true
i
have
never
been
blessed
with
hearing
a
word
from
her
save
in
her
songs
but
i
can
understand
them
and
there
was
one
she
sang
which
has
been
ringing
in
my
ears
ever
since
i
heard
it
say
had
it
any
reference
to
me
and
herself
you
have
guessed
well
she
replied
i
told
her
to
sing
it
in
the
chance
of
its
being
understood
and
blessed
be
alla
it
was
not
in
vain
but
the
time
is
passing
fast
my
son
and
what
can
be
done
nay
said
i
that
i
wish
to
hear
from
yourself
for
i
know
not
how
to
proceed
neither
do
i
know
this
town
nor
the
house
where
she
lives
so
what
can
i
advise
i
am
helpless
in
this
matter
yet
willing
to
the
utmost
listen
then
said
the
old
woman
i
will
describe
the
place
and
you
must
come
after
me
and
see
it
from
the
outside
that
you
may
know
it
in
the
night
the
place
she
is
now
in
and
where
she
will
most
likely
sleep
is
a
small
tiled
house
at
the
corner
of
the
wall
of
the
zenana
toward
the
street
there
are
two
windows
some
distance
from
the
ground
yet
not
so
high
but
that
she
might
get
out
if
any
one
helped
her
on
the
outside
there
is
no
other
way
of
her
escaping
for
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
get
through
the
zenana
and
afterwards
through
the
open
courts
which
are
full
of
soldiers
say
will
you
dare
the
adventure
or
be
a
coward
a
namurd
who
would
not
risk
a
drop
of
blood
for
a
woman
and
one
so
fair
as
she
is
i
am
no
coward
i
believe
said
i
though
i
have
no
deeds
of
arms
to
boast
of
i
accept
the
risk
and
i
pray
alla
to
defend
us
are
there
soldiers
near
the
place
no
said
she
not
one
the
only
danger
is
at
the
village
gate
which
is
always
guarded
how
will
you
pass
this
if
that
is
all
said
i
trust
to
me
and
inshalla
we
will
all
laugh
at
the
nuwab
beard
in
the
morning
but
tell
me
how
do
you
intend
to
contrive
to
accompany
us
ah
i
have
arranged
that
already
i
am
allowed
free
egress
at
any
hour
of
the
night
upon
the
various
pretences
or
necessities
of
my
mistress
and
i
can
get
out
at
midnight
and
meet
you
anywhere
you
may
determine
this
is
good
said
i
now
come
and
show
me
the
place
she
guided
me
through
the
gate
we
had
just
passed
and
turning
down
a
narrow
alley
desired
me
to
mark
the
various
windings
as
we
went
along
which
i
did
we
at
last
reached
a
street
between
two
high
walls
one
of
which
was
the
nuwab
zenana
and
passing
on
we
arrived
at
length
under
a
small
tiled
house
which
answered
the
description
she
had
given
of
it
this
is
the
place
she
said
and
that
is
the
window
from
whence
she
must
descend
it
is
not
very
high
as
you
see
and
there
will
not
be
much
difficulty
in
her
getting
out
i
see
none
i
replied
if
she
has
only
a
stout
heart
tell
her
to
tie
her
sheets
together
and
drop
them
over
we
will
be
below
and
take
care
she
reaches
the
ground
easily
i
will
said
she
and
now
away
we
may
be
seen
and
if
so
alla
be
our
help
she
sees
us
cried
i
for
there
is
a
hand
stretched
forth
from
the
window
it
is
she
said
the
old
woman
and
oh
what
joy
it
must
be
to
her
to
know
that
there
are
persons
anxious
and
willing
to
serve
her
now
my
poor
bird
thou
shalt
no
longer
have
a
cage
though
it
be
a
gilded
one
but
away
my
soul
away
do
not
loiter
here
a
smile
from
her
were
dearly
purchased
now
and
you
will
have
thousands
aye
with
her
blessings
too
i
go
said
i
but
fail
not
nurse
for
your
life
see
that
all
is
right
you
must
meet
us
at
the
corner
we
last
passed
the
old
woman
nodded
her
assent
and
i
withdrew
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
spot
though
i
would
have
given
worlds
for
one
glance
for
one
approving
smile
from
the
object
of
my
love
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
tents
i
summoned
bhudrinath
told
him
of
my
success
and
unfolded
to
him
the
plan
as
it
stood
at
present
he
was
rejoiced
and
saw
nothing
objectionable
in
it
i
have
one
thing
however
said
he
to
represent
which
you
may
do
or
not
as
you
please
what
is
it
say
on
why
he
replied
although
it
will
be
as
you
say
an
easy
enough
matter
to
get
out
of
the
town
i
by
no
means
think
it
so
easy
to
get
in
by
alla
you
say
truly
said
i
what
advice
can
you
give
to
aid
my
plan
you
see
rejoined
he
that
the
gates
are
guarded
i
tried
myself
to
get
in
last
night
before
midnight
as
i
had
an
affair
of
my
own
to
look
after
and
the
fair
one
expected
me
but
the
sons
of
dogs
at
the
gates
may
their
sisters
be
defiled
swore
i
was
a
thief
and
after
interchanging
abuse
for
a
long
time
they
finally
shut
the
wicket
in
my
face
and
i
was
forced
to
return
in
the
worst
of
all
possible
humours
so
my
advice
is
that
we
go
in
before
nightfall
and
take
up
our
quarters
in
the
shop
of
a
bhutteara
with
whom
i
have
scraped
an
acquaintance
the
fellow
will
not
suspect
anything
if
we
leave
his
place
in
the
night
as
i
hinted
my
bad
fortune
of
last
night
to
him
and
he
was
the
one
to
propose
my
coming
to
his
place
in
the
evening
to
go
wherever
i
pleased
afterwards
so
what
say
you
shall
we
go
to
the
fellow
or
trust
to
our
wits
to
get
in
the
best
way
we
can
your
plan
is
a
good
one
said
i
and
i
thank
you
for
your
bad
luck
last
night
but
for
it
we
might
have
gone
and
knocked
our
heads
against
the
gate
to
no
purpose
to
be
sure
we
might
climb
over
the
wall
and
i
wonder
you
did
not
think
of
it
i
did
he
replied
and
was
undecided
about
attempting
it
but
some
fellow
might
have
seen
me
and
taking
me
for
a
thief
have
thought
no
more
of
sending
a
ball
through
me
than
if
i
were
a
dog
so
i
came
away
thou
hast
a
wonderful
deal
of
discretion
said
i
now
my
hot
blood
would
have
led
me
into
some
scrape
whereas
thou
hast
eaten
thy
and
am
now
at
thy
service
rejoined
he
so
we
sleep
inside
which
i
am
glad
of
and
we
will
get
out
through
the
further
gate
it
will
be
some
way
round
but
that
is
better
than
facing
the
fellows
at
this
gate
who
i
suspect
know
me
or
will
recognise
my
voice
for
i
was
too
angry
to
disguise
it
we
will
said
i
and
now
i
must
in
and
eat
for
i
have
fasted
since
the
morning
and
an
enterprise
is
ill
done
on
an
empty
stomach
after
evening
prayer
bhudrinath
and
myself
went
into
the
town
and
it
was
well
we
did
so
for
the
men
at
the
gate
knew
him
perfectly
and
joked
him
about
his
bad
success
the
night
before
thou
art
beforehand
with
us
my
friend
said
one
fellow
and
thou
art
wise
for
hadst
thou
come
later
we
should
have
shut
the
door
in
thy
face
as
before
you
might
have
been
more
civil
said
bhudrinath
laughing
i
suppose
though
you
would
not
let
me
in
you
will
let
me
out
in
case
i
should
bring
any
one
with
me
why
that
is
not
against
orders
exactly
but
you
would
have
to
pay
toll
so
if
you
have
not
brought
money
with
you
you
had
better
stay
where
you
are
i
may
find
some
probably
said
bhudrinath
to
the
speaker
enough
at
any
rate
to
fill
your
hookahs
for
some
days
if
there
is
occasion
agreed
said
all
the
fellows
a
bargain
by
alla
a
few
rupees
and
you
may
take
any
one
you
please
the
nuwab
harem
too
to
boot
though
there
is
not
much
in
it
by
all
accounts
who
is
your
wughyra
your
officer
said
i
and
one
of
the
men
stepped
out
i
am
he
may
it
please
your
nobility
and
i
can
wink
at
an
honest
fellow
doings
as
well
as
another
provided
you
are
paid
for
it
said
i
of
course
said
he
laughing
we
are
lucky
when
chance
throws
gentlemen
like
you
in
our
way
here
then
said
i
are
five
rupees
to
entertain
yourselves
with
and
see
that
you
do
get
drunk
or
the
blame
will
fall
on
us
may
your
condescension
increase
cried
the
whole
we
are
your
worship
devoted
servants
now
how
do
you
mean
to
get
out
asked
bhudrinath
as
we
passed
on
not
this
way
said
i
if
i
can
help
it
for
there
will
be
a
disturbance
about
the
matter
and
if
we
go
out
here
it
will
give
a
clue
to
our
discovery
we
will
try
the
other
gate
first
i
will
lay
a
wager
they
are
all
drunk
in
an
hour
said
he
and
we
may
then
open
the
gate
for
ourselves
but
here
is
the
bhutteara
shop
and
those
kabobs
smell
very
savoury
i
sometimes
wish
i
was
not
a
brahmin
that
i
might
eat
them
as
you
do
ah
said
i
it
is
well
for
you
to
say
that
but
perhaps
they
may
have
proved
too
tempting
at
some
time
or
other
by
krishna
i
swear
you
wrong
me
cried
he
brahmin
i
am
and
will
be
you
know
my
creed
tells
me
that
i
have
been
successively
transformed
through
every
grade
of
suffering
humanity
and
now
that
i
have
reached
the
top
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
descend
to
the
bottom
and
undergo
the
whole
pain
over
again
for
the
sake
of
a
few
kabobs
you
are
right
said
i
nevertheless
i
will
try
them
i
could
not
eat
when
i
wished
at
my
tent
but
their
smell
has
raised
my
appetite
wonderfully
and
in
a
short
time
my
fingers
were
pretty
deep
in
a
smoking
dish
of
kicheree
and
kabobs
as
hot
as
pepper
could
make
them
friend
bhutteara
said
i
when
i
had
done
surely
the
shitan
himself
must
visit
your
shop
now
and
then
for
no
other
could
eat
those
scraps
of
meat
except
he
had
a
mouth
of
brass
i
beg
pardon
said
the
fellow
but
i
was
away
on
business
and
i
suspect
my
daughter
must
as
you
say
have
put
too
much
pepper
in
them
but
i
can
make
my
lord
a
cup
of
sherbet
a
poor
imitation
of
what
true
believers
will
drink
in
paradise
and
it
will
cool
his
mouth
and
a
hookah
if
you
please
said
i
then
i
shall
feel
more
comfortable
chapter
i
heard
the
bhutteara
bustling
about
in
the
interior
of
his
house
for
a
while
and
was
gratified
to
see
that
he
so
evidently
exerted
himself
to
please
me
in
a
short
time
more
the
sherbet
was
prepared
and
its
grateful
coolness
with
the
which
had
been
mingled
with
it
allayed
the
irritation
of
my
mouth
and
enabled
me
to
enjoy
a
hookah
which
if
served
in
a
less
costly
apparatus
than
that
the
nuwab
had
offered
me
was
as
good
in
flavour
its
pleasing
fumes
composed
me
and
quieted
the
feverish
excitement
i
had
hitherto
been
in
you
appear
comfortable
said
bhudrinath
i
am
so
i
replied
and
i
doubt
not
you
envy
me
in
spite
of
your
brahminical
belief
perhaps
i
do
said
he
yet
having
never
tasted
the
luxuries
of
meat
and
other
things
you
set
such
value
upon
i
can
not
estimate
them
sufficiently
and
i
care
not
about
them
nay
more
the
very
idea
of
meat
the
sight
of
it
in
its
raw
state
the
blood
the
garbage
accompanying
it
are
loathsome
to
me
and
i
very
much
question
were
i
to
become
a
mahomedan
whether
i
could
ever
bring
myself
to
eat
it
pah
the
idea
is
horrible
i
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
his
disgust
and
he
was
not
angry
but
said
i
how
are
we
to
wake
at
the
proper
time
an
hour
too
soon
or
too
late
and
our
enterprise
is
ruined
i
was
thinking
of
the
same
thing
he
replied
and
turning
to
the
bhutteara
he
asked
him
how
late
he
remained
up
for
he
continued
my
friend
and
i
have
a
small
matter
on
our
hands
about
midnight
can
we
trust
to
you
to
awaken
us
if
we
sleep
certainly
said
the
man
i
never
shut
up
my
shop
till
after
midnight
for
sometimes
travellers
drop
in
and
poor
hungry
souls
the
first
place
they
seek
is
the
bhutteara
shop
and
were
there
not
something
hot
for
them
woe
be
to
me
here
is
a
trifle
over
and
above
the
price
of
the
kabobs
said
i
throwing
him
a
few
rupees
to
keep
you
awake
he
picked
up
the
money
with
many
salams
and
good
wishes
and
my
hookah
being
smoked
out
and
feeling
drowsy
i
laid
myself
down
and
slept
but
not
long
as
is
often
the
case
excitement
overpowered
sleep
and
i
awoke
in
alarm
lest
i
had
overslept
the
time
i
had
not
however
done
so
looking
round
me
i
saw
the
bhutteara
busily
employed
in
cooking
cakes
while
his
little
daughter
was
turning
some
kabobs
on
the
fire
he
observed
me
and
said
you
are
soon
awake
sahib
it
wants
a
good
hour
yet
of
your
time
you
had
better
go
to
sleep
again
you
see
i
have
work
in
hand
which
will
keep
me
up
beyond
that
time
for
some
travellers
have
arrived
and
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
satisfy
their
hungry
stomachs
i
can
not
sleep
again
said
i
i
am
refreshed
and
another
hookah
or
two
will
keep
me
awake
till
it
is
time
to
go
i
understand
you
said
he
you
young
men
are
and
are
always
seeking
adventures
but
it
is
only
as
it
ought
to
be
i
would
not
give
a
couree
for
a
young
fellow
who
had
not
the
spirit
you
appear
to
possess
may
you
prosper
said
i
but
let
me
have
another
hookah
for
truly
the
first
has
left
a
grateful
flavour
in
my
mouth
he
disappeared
into
the
interior
of
his
house
for
a
short
time
and
returned
with
it
now
said
he
if
the
first
pleased
you
you
can
not
but
be
gratified
with
this
it
is
prepared
from
a
choice
receipt
and
it
is
only
persons
of
rank
and
taste
like
yourself
to
whom
i
ever
give
it
it
would
be
lost
on
the
multitude
it
was
as
he
said
delicious
and
my
pipe
had
been
refilled
several
times
to
my
great
satisfaction
when
he
told
me
the
time
i
desired
was
come
yonder
star
said
he
rises
over
the
houses
a
short
time
before
midnight
so
rouse
your
companion
you
will
be
expected
i
did
so
bhudrinath
was
soon
awake
and
ready
to
accompany
me
we
took
leave
of
our
host
and
directed
our
way
through
the
now
deserted
streets
to
the
place
of
assignation
we
are
wonderfully
like
two
thieves
said
he
to
me
what
if
the
village
watch
should
catch
us
we
should
look
very
foolish
i
see
no
danger
of
it
said
i
but
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
when
we
saw
the
patrol
coming
down
the
street
before
us
there
was
an
open
gate
close
to
us
and
stepping
inside
we
hid
ourselves
behind
the
large
doors
we
had
however
been
observed
and
as
the
men
passed
one
said
he
was
sure
he
had
seen
two
men
lurking
there
nonsense
said
another
fellow
you
are
always
seeing
men
in
the
dark
come
along
it
is
just
midnight
and
i
am
sleepy
we
will
go
a
little
further
and
then
beat
the
duphra
if
there
are
any
thieves
about
they
will
run
away
a
loud
yawn
was
a
pretty
good
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
assertion
and
they
passed
on
just
as
we
emerged
from
our
the
duphra
and
horns
were
sounded
and
answered
from
the
other
sides
of
the
town
and
then
all
was
again
as
still
as
death
save
when
a
village
dog
howled
his
wild
cry
to
the
moon
there
is
now
no
danger
said
i
come
on
we
are
near
the
place
a
few
paces
further
brought
us
to
the
corner
where
the
old
woman
said
she
would
await
our
coming
and
there
to
our
great
joy
we
found
her
my
blessings
on
ye
that
ye
are
come
said
she
i
thought
the
night
would
never
wear
away
and
i
have
been
waiting
here
for
some
hours
is
all
prepared
said
i
is
she
ready
ay
that
she
is
i
warrant
the
hours
have
gone
as
slowly
with
her
as
with
me
and
listen
said
the
old
woman
she
has
hit
upon
a
rare
device
which
will
mislead
suspicion
and
she
laughed
heartily
for
the
love
of
alla
be
quiet
said
i
were
we
heard
or
seen
we
are
undone
for
that
matter
there
is
not
much
to
apprehend
for
this
house
on
one
side
is
deserted
and
inside
the
wall
on
the
other
is
nothing
but
the
nuwab
garden
where
no
one
stays
at
night
tell
me
then
what
her
plan
is
can
we
assist
it
oh
no
said
the
woman
it
is
her
own
invention
and
a
rare
one
it
is
i
had
just
come
to
her
when
she
sent
me
out
to
get
a
bladder
full
of
blood
i
could
not
make
out
what
she
wanted
it
for
but
i
went
and
bought
it
though
i
had
to
get
a
kid
killed
on
the
pretence
that
the
meat
was
suddenly
required
well
no
sooner
had
i
returned
than
she
poured
some
of
it
on
her
bed
rumpled
and
daubed
the
sheets
tore
off
pieces
of
her
dress
and
scattered
them
about
the
room
also
some
of
the
beautiful
hair
from
her
head
which
she
also
threw
about
and
in
short
made
the
place
look
as
if
she
had
been
wounded
and
there
had
been
a
scuffle
to
get
her
out
ah
it
was
a
rare
device
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
a
nuwab
who
lives
at
a
distance
and
who
has
been
trying
to
get
this
one
to
give
her
up
and
there
has
been
much
quarrelling
between
them
on
the
subject
will
be
suspected
and
it
will
never
be
thought
that
she
has
run
off
of
her
own
accord
is
wonderful
said
i
and
proverbial
as
is
woman
wit
yet
by
alla
this
is
an
instance
which
ought
to
be
written
in
a
book
but
we
are
delaying
here
to
no
purpose
come
then
said
the
old
woman
it
is
but
a
few
steps
further
we
stationed
ourselves
under
the
window
in
which
there
was
a
strong
light
burning
and
the
old
woman
giving
a
sharp
but
low
cough
a
figure
was
seen
at
the
casement
it
opened
it
was
she
is
he
here
said
a
low
sweet
voice
which
thrilled
through
me
yes
lady
the
humblest
of
your
slaves
is
here
and
prays
you
to
be
quick
for
the
sake
of
alla
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
will
be
with
you
instantly
replied
she
do
so
said
i
but
be
quick
or
we
are
lost
she
withdrew
from
the
window
and
a
few
instants
after
reappeared
and
let
down
a
box
and
bundle
i
unfastened
them
and
she
drew
up
the
sheet
now
said
she
i
come
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
sheet
i
must
fasten
it
inside
ere
i
descend
leave
that
to
me
said
i
only
come
down
a
few
instants
more
were
occupied
in
fastening
the
cloth
and
she
then
stepped
out
on
the
ledge
my
heart
beat
audibly
lest
she
should
fall
and
hurt
herself
and
we
should
be
observed
but
i
and
bhudrinath
placed
ourselves
underneath
to
catch
her
if
she
fell
it
was
however
unnecessary
for
she
was
on
the
ground
in
an
instant
and
i
had
pressed
her
to
my
heart
the
rest
must
not
be
left
undone
said
i
and
ascending
by
the
sheet
i
entered
the
window
the
room
was
a
small
one
and
by
the
hasty
glance
i
threw
around
it
it
appeared
indeed
as
though
there
had
been
a
scene
of
violence
and
bloodshed
clothes
were
strewn
about
the
floor
and
bed
were
stained
with
blood
and
pieces
of
torn
apparel
lying
here
and
there
gave
to
the
whole
the
appearance
of
what
was
intended
i
did
not
stay
a
moment
but
unfastening
the
sheet
threw
it
down
and
getting
outside
the
window
dropped
to
the
ground
the
shock
hurt
me
considerably
but
it
was
not
the
time
for
complaint
we
held
a
hurried
consultation
as
to
which
gate
we
should
go
out
by
bhudrinath
again
preferring
the
one
by
which
we
entered
this
however
was
overruled
by
all
of
us
and
guided
by
the
old
woman
we
took
our
way
to
the
other
we
met
not
a
soul
in
the
lonely
streets
and
by
the
blessing
of
alla
on
reaching
the
gate
we
found
the
wicket
open
and
the
man
who
should
have
guarded
it
fast
asleep
with
his
shield
under
his
head
and
his
sword
by
his
side
stealthily
and
slowly
we
passed
by
him
lest
our
footfall
should
awake
him
and
gaining
the
outside
we
hurried
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
walls
until
we
gained
the
plain
on
which
was
our
encampment
when
fairly
within
our
guards
who
were
stationed
round
the
spot
the
fair
being
who
had
hitherto
clung
to
me
suddenly
sunk
down
to
fetch
water
for
her
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
after
forcing
some
into
her
mouth
she
recovered
i
was
overcome
with
joy
said
she
throwing
herself
at
my
feet
and
indeed
if
you
knew
the
anxious
suspense
i
have
been
in
ever
since
last
afternoon
you
would
believe
me
at
one
time
i
was
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
deliverance
from
my
hateful
servitude
and
again
as
the
night
wore
on
and
i
tried
to
count
the
hours
i
sometimes
thought
that
the
time
had
passed
and
that
my
preparations
had
been
but
a
mockery
and
now
to
find
myself
free
and
with
you
ah
my
lord
it
is
too
much
joy
my
heart
is
like
to
burst
i
raised
her
up
and
caressed
her
and
seating
her
under
a
tree
put
my
arm
around
her
and
we
sat
in
the
lovely
moonlight
in
silence
she
could
not
speak
and
i
would
not
break
the
current
of
her
thoughts
whatever
they
might
be
how
long
we
sat
there
i
can
not
tell
we
were
interrupted
by
the
old
woman
this
is
no
time
for
dalliance
said
she
my
lady
requires
rest
and
methinks
sir
were
you
to
find
means
of
getting
us
on
before
morning
breaks
we
should
elude
pursuit
and
you
could
follow
us
you
say
truly
said
i
and
it
shall
be
cared
for
fortunately
the
cart
of
the
sahoukar
had
not
been
sold
and
though
it
was
still
laden
with
his
effects
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
it
for
the
two
females
i
went
to
bhudrinath
whom
i
found
fast
asleep
after
his
night
work
when
he
was
fully
awakened
he
seemed
to
comprehend
that
his
services
were
again
required
what
more
work
said
he
well
meer
sahib
i
am
ready
what
is
it
it
is
too
bad
for
me
to
rouse
you
so
soon
said
i
and
to
require
you
to
go
on
with
this
matter
for
alla
who
sees
my
heart
alone
knows
how
grateful
it
is
to
you
for
your
assistance
this
night
do
not
say
so
my
young
friend
cried
he
laughing
i
would
do
anything
for
a
little
fun
and
excitement
why
i
rejoined
you
must
know
the
old
woman
has
advised
instant
flight
from
hence
so
you
and
some
of
the
men
must
be
ready
to
be
off
before
daylight
and
as
i
have
prepared
the
old
sahoukar
cart
for
her
you
will
be
easily
able
to
get
eight
or
ten
coss
from
hence
and
the
same
the
next
day
when
you
must
halt
till
we
come
up
remember
you
are
a
moosulman
for
the
time
and
she
must
be
protected
and
screened
as
though
she
were
the
wife
of
one
i
understand
said
he
and
will
do
my
trust
faithfully
i
believe
you
i
replied
and
now
for
the
road
which
to
take
i
am
undecided
i
have
heard
that
two
branch
off
from
this
to
hyderabad
stay
said
bhudrinath
i
think
peer
khan
knows
both
i
will
go
and
bring
him
you
know
he
is
one
of
my
set
he
went
and
returned
with
the
man
i
have
explained
all
to
him
said
he
and
now
hear
what
he
has
to
say
i
beg
to
represent
said
peer
khan
that
i
know
both
roads
but
not
perfectly
still
i
should
think
what
the
meer
sahib
counsels
the
best
for
the
other
is
a
sad
lonely
one
and
few
travellers
go
by
it
as
to
the
chance
of
being
pursued
we
must
trust
to
our
good
tukdeer
destiny
which
has
brought
us
thus
far
without
an
accident
and
inshalla
will
carry
us
on
well
peer
khan
said
i
you
must
be
the
guide
you
are
the
only
person
who
knows
anything
about
the
road
and
i
can
only
say
that
if
you
are
steady
and
faithful
i
will
make
you
a
handsome
present
when
i
overtake
you
at
nirmul
may
your
condescension
increase
meer
sahib
said
he
but
putting
the
enam
out
of
the
question
you
know
very
well
that
there
is
not
a
man
among
us
who
would
not
give
his
blood
or
any
time
he
might
be
called
upon
for
you
but
come
bhudrinath
as
we
are
to
start
soon
i
had
better
get
the
men
together
and
be
ready
i
returned
to
the
tent
where
i
found
zora
and
the
old
woman
sitting
covered
up
in
their
sheets
and
warming
themselves
over
a
fire
they
had
lighted
in
a
few
words
i
told
them
of
the
necessity
of
flight
and
added
alas
i
do
not
accompany
you
now
we
have
had
a
consultation
on
the
subject
and
have
determined
that
for
the
sake
of
mutual
safety
we
must
for
the
present
separate
alla
who
sees
my
heart
knows
that
it
will
burn
with
anxiety
and
care
while
i
am
absent
from
you
for
know
lady
that
from
the
time
i
first
beheld
you
in
the
durbar
my
soul
hath
been
consumed
by
your
beauty
and
as
then
i
was
plunged
into
despair
at
the
thought
that
you
never
could
be
mine
so
now
is
the
excess
of
grief
that
i
must
part
with
you
she
was
silent
for
some
time
but
at
last
throwing
back
her
veil
and
again
displaying
her
beautiful
face
to
me
she
put
her
hand
into
mine
i
trust
you
said
she
i
have
no
fear
now
except
for
you
i
will
go
without
a
murmur
for
i
see
how
necessary
it
is
for
us
to
separate
yet
assure
me
my
beloved
that
you
will
not
be
long
away
and
i
am
content
i
repeat
said
i
only
two
days
at
the
furthest
we
shall
follow
you
evening
or
the
next
morning
and
once
that
we
are
in
motion
i
will
push
on
till
i
overtake
you
where
we
will
wait
for
my
father
and
the
rest
by
what
road
do
we
travel
asked
the
old
woman
by
nirmul
said
i
it
is
out
of
the
way
and
we
have
therefore
chosen
it
it
is
not
probable
that
the
nuwab
people
if
he
sends
any
out
will
take
that
direction
you
are
right
she
replied
they
will
not
but
i
would
give
much
to
see
him
when
the
flight
of
this
pretty
bird
is
known
what
shall
we
care
said
i
except
to
laugh
at
his
old
beard
i
will
go
into
the
town
as
soon
as
the
alarm
has
spread
and
you
shall
have
all
the
news
when
we
meet
again
now
bid
me
start
said
bhudrinath
who
then
entered
the
tent
and
i
am
off
for
the
present
i
am
jumal
khan
by
which
name
inquire
for
me
on
the
road
may
god
protect
you
all
you
have
a
precious
charge
my
friend
said
i
and
would
that
i
could
even
now
take
your
place
the
women
were
soon
ready
and
i
saw
them
comfortably
settled
in
their
vehicle
now
i
am
off
cried
bhudrinath
drive
on
the
cart
and
do
some
of
you
fellows
keep
about
it
as
though
it
were
a
decent
zenana
alla
hafiz
said
i
and
may
the
prophet
guide
you
safely
they
went
on
i
stood
watching
them
until
a
turn
in
the
road
hid
them
from
my
sight
and
i
betook
myself
to
my
tent
where
throwing
myself
down
sleep
soon
came
over
me
i
was
awakened
by
my
father
who
came
into
the
tent
where
i
was
lying
he
seemed
angry
with
me
for
having
been
out
all
night
as
he
said
on
some
unprofitable
if
not
unworthy
business
but
said
he
it
is
time
for
the
morning
prayer
and
after
that
i
will
hear
what
you
have
been
about
i
accompanied
him
to
the
skirts
of
our
camp
where
spreading
our
carpets
we
watched
for
the
blush
of
dawn
to
go
through
the
usual
forms
when
they
were
over
he
seated
himself
and
desired
to
hear
what
i
had
done
i
fear
me
no
good
said
he
but
tell
me
so
i
recounted
the
events
of
the
night
and
was
prepared
for
a
severe
lecture
and
a
great
deal
of
advice
and
reproof
i
was
for
once
agreeably
disappointed
instead
of
being
angry
he
laughed
heartily
at
the
whole
affair
and
applauded
our
arrangements
in
having
sent
zora
out
of
the
way
the
sun
was
barely
risen
when
there
arose
a
noise
from
the
town
and
it
was
plain
enough
to
us
that
the
discovery
had
taken
place
the
whole
place
was
in
a
ferment
people
hurried
out
of
the
gates
and
collected
into
groups
and
by
the
pointing
to
our
camp
and
their
gesticulations
we
were
obviously
the
suspected
persons
and
as
we
had
anticipated
about
twenty
horse
and
some
foot
soldiers
issued
from
the
gate
nearest
to
us
and
came
directly
towards
us
they
surrounded
our
little
camp
and
one
or
two
who
appeared
the
leaders
of
the
party
rode
up
and
in
an
authoritative
manner
demanded
to
see
our
leader
i
had
previously
arranged
with
my
father
that
he
was
to
continue
to
support
his
character
as
a
merchant
and
to
put
me
forward
as
the
jemadar
of
the
party
and
as
he
knew
that
i
had
appeared
in
the
character
at
the
nuwab
durbar
and
supported
it
well
he
had
readily
acceded
to
my
request
you
see
the
leader
said
i
in
my
poor
person
and
what
may
be
the
demands
of
the
nuwab
sahib
so
early
is
there
anything
his
poor
servant
can
do
to
prove
how
much
he
is
impressed
with
the
kind
treatment
he
has
received
you
must
be
content
to
be
our
prisoner
said
the
man
haughtily
until
your
camp
is
searched
a
strange
event
has
happened
and
you
are
suspected
of
what
said
i
appearing
thunderstruck
of
what
can
i
be
suspected
but
the
camp
is
before
you
sirs
by
all
means
search
it
perhaps
said
i
bitterly
your
town
has
been
robbed
and
it
is
not
wonderful
that
persons
of
respectability
should
be
suspected
in
this
unmannerly
country
peace
cried
the
man
we
must
do
our
duty
and
i
for
one
for
the
sake
of
appearances
should
be
glad
to
find
you
had
not
requited
the
nuwab
hospitality
with
treachery
i
am
dumb
said
i
notwithstanding
that
i
am
in
utter
astonishment
at
your
words
but
by
all
means
search
the
place
and
afterwards
perhaps
you
will
in
kindness
unravel
this
mystery
to
me
he
rode
with
me
to
my
tent
and
dismounting
entered
it
with
me
followed
by
two
or
three
of
his
men
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
the
carpet
and
mattress
on
which
i
had
slept
a
few
cooking
utensils
and
some
of
the
bales
of
plunder
piled
up
at
the
farther
end
she
is
not
here
said
azim
khan
the
leader
of
the
nuwab
party
let
us
go
to
the
other
tent
i
accompanied
them
and
making
a
salam
to
my
father
told
him
that
the
nuwab
people
wished
to
search
his
tent
as
they
had
done
mine
and
added
do
not
oppose
them
lest
the
nuwab
should
in
truth
see
reason
to
suspect
us
certainly
not
said
my
father
here
is
the
tent
and
i
am
the
nuwab
slave
it
is
not
likely
that
an
old
man
like
me
should
have
women
concealed
here
so
his
tent
was
searched
as
mine
had
been
and
afterwards
the
temporary
screens
of
the
men
but
nothing
was
found
and
the
party
were
evidently
disappointed
we
are
on
the
wrong
track
and
i
told
you
so
said
azim
khan
to
the
leader
depend
upon
it
as
i
told
the
nuwab
it
is
that
rascal
sheffee
khan
work
we
all
know
him
to
be
in
the
employ
of
the
hakim
of
nursee
who
wanted
to
get
the
girl
and
we
had
better
be
after
him
than
wasting
our
time
here
a
girl
cried
i
truly
this
is
most
wonderful
for
the
sake
of
alla
satisfy
my
curiosity
what
is
all
this
about
by
your
head
said
i
to
the
leader
but
that
it
seems
a
serious
matter
i
feel
much
tempted
to
laugh
at
the
idea
of
my
poor
camp
being
searched
for
a
girl
some
slave
i
presume
who
has
run
away
or
been
carried
off
by
her
lover
say
sahib
what
has
happened
why
it
is
no
laughing
matter
to
us
whatever
it
may
be
to
you
said
the
leader
send
your
men
out
of
hearing
and
you
shall
have
the
whole
story
away
with
you
cried
i
to
our
men
who
had
crowded
round
this
is
no
tale
for
your
ears
the
affair
is
this
said
the
man
until
last
night
there
was
in
the
zenana
of
the
nuwab
a
of
surpassing
beauty
and
accomplishments
but
early
this
morning
her
apartment
was
found
empty
marks
of
violence
everywhere
about
it
blood
on
the
sheets
of
her
bed
and
some
of
her
hair
and
portions
of
her
clothes
strewn
about
the
room
there
was
no
alarm
in
the
night
the
gates
of
the
town
were
closed
and
guarded
as
usual
and
it
seems
some
work
of
the
shitan
that
this
should
have
taken
place
and
that
we
should
have
had
dirt
thrown
on
our
beards
without
knowing
by
whom
there
is
the
nuwab
raving
and
swearing
like
a
madman
his
zenana
is
all
in
confusion
and
what
is
worst
of
all
he
threatens
to
discharge
every
one
of
us
without
we
either
bring
back
the
girl
or
get
him
intelligence
of
her
within
three
days
protection
of
alla
cried
both
i
and
my
father
this
is
most
extraordinary
and
have
you
no
suspicion
who
has
insulted
you
in
this
manner
why
said
the
man
you
were
first
suspected
as
being
strangers
and
a
large
party
and
we
were
desired
to
search
your
camp
but
here
we
find
nothing
but
bales
of
goods
and
indeed
you
are
not
likely
persons
to
have
carried
her
off
for
i
question
whether
you
ever
saw
her
i
dare
say
said
i
she
was
one
of
the
women
who
were
in
the
durbar
the
other
night
when
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
nuwab
very
likely
he
returned
were
those
you
saw
they
were
both
so
said
i
one
was
tall
and
fair
the
other
was
shorter
and
not
so
fair
but
very
handsome
that
was
the
girl
said
the
man
i
have
seen
her
myself
once
or
twice
when
i
could
get
inside
of
a
night
but
i
am
wasting
my
time
here
and
must
return
you
may
depend
upon
my
fully
exonerating
you
from
any
suspicion
in
the
matter
your
favourable
opinion
said
i
will
no
doubt
have
its
due
weight
and
i
pray
you
to
carry
our
condolence
to
the
nuwab
and
say
that
if
we
have
permission
we
will
wait
on
him
to
express
it
i
will
deliver
your
message
said
he
but
i
think
you
will
not
be
admitted
as
really
he
is
in
great
grief
more
on
account
of
the
insult
perhaps
than
the
loss
of
the
girl
i
take
my
leave
he
saluted
us
and
rode
off
and
not
long
after
a
servant
of
the
nuwab
came
with
a
civil
message
and
some
fruit
to
say
that
his
master
regretted
he
could
not
see
us
and
was
sorry
that
he
had
been
under
the
necessity
of
searching
our
camp
we
dismissed
him
with
a
present
and
reiterated
our
condolences
which
he
promised
to
deliver
and
now
said
i
to
my
father
this
is
no
place
for
us
longer
we
must
be
off
what
say
you
to
a
march
in
the
afternoon
it
is
good
said
he
we
will
go
tell
the
men
to
be
prepared
chapter
xi
we
were
on
our
way
towards
nirmul
in
the
afternoon
and
as
we
had
heard
no
more
of
the
nuwab
and
his
distress
we
were
relieved
from
our
anxiety
but
i
was
in
great
dread
the
whole
time
we
remained
at
the
town
after
the
nuwab
people
had
left
us
lest
some
chance
should
open
to
them
a
clue
to
detect
us
the
bhutteara
might
possibly
reveal
what
he
knew
of
our
proceedings
for
although
he
knew
not
our
object
still
our
remaining
with
him
for
so
short
a
time
as
he
must
have
formed
a
notion
that
we
were
after
some
woman
coupled
with
the
disappearance
of
zora
might
have
led
him
to
suppose
and
very
naturally
so
that
we
had
carried
her
off
fortunately
however
no
ill
effects
did
ensue
and
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
oomerkhér
we
reached
nirmul
as
i
entered
the
town
i
saw
bhudrinath
in
a
shop
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
street
in
conversation
with
a
man
a
moosulman
by
his
appearance
he
did
not
observe
me
but
on
my
calling
out
his
assumed
name
he
hastily
rose
and
assisting
me
to
dismount
embraced
me
cordially
is
she
safe
i
asked
in
a
low
tone
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
by
his
acquaintance
she
is
he
replied
you
have
nothing
to
fear
and
she
is
all
impatience
to
behold
you
again
sahib
i
did
not
lose
an
instant
in
again
beholding
my
beloved
and
pressing
her
once
more
to
my
heart
she
was
more
lovely
than
ever
and
after
some
fond
chidings
for
my
delay
and
a
relation
of
all
the
anxiety
she
had
suffered
in
my
absence
and
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
that
voluptuous
feeling
of
joy
and
security
which
those
only
know
who
have
loved
and
been
separated
from
each
other
under
circumstances
of
doubt
or
danger
after
passing
some
time
with
her
i
rejoined
bhudrinath
who
was
the
man
you
were
conversing
with
when
i
came
up
i
asked
why
said
he
from
what
i
have
picked
up
as
yet
i
suspect
he
has
urgent
reasons
for
getting
away
from
hence
as
fast
as
he
can
in
other
words
he
has
been
helping
himself
to
more
than
he
ought
in
some
revenue
affair
and
his
safety
depends
upon
flight
i
told
him
i
expected
you
and
your
party
and
that
he
would
have
a
good
opportunity
of
getting
away
if
he
chose
to
mix
with
us
you
see
added
bhudrinath
that
when
once
i
have
fixed
my
eye
upon
any
one
it
is
against
my
principles
to
let
him
escape
me
now
as
this
is
the
case
we
must
have
that
man
first
because
of
my
principles
as
i
said
and
secondly
because
of
the
money
which
most
assuredly
he
has
in
his
possession
do
you
comprehend
perfectly
said
i
laughing
your
argument
is
an
admirable
one
therefore
i
will
second
your
endeavours
with
all
my
heart
how
shall
we
proceed
why
said
bhudrinath
that
is
a
somewhat
difficult
matter
to
determine
for
i
do
not
know
where
the
fellow
lives
but
he
promised
to
be
with
me
soon
and
i
dare
say
he
will
not
be
long
away
we
must
spread
the
carpet
of
patience
said
i
and
sit
on
it
i
suppose
till
he
makes
his
appearance
meanwhile
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
eat
well
sahib
i
went
inside
the
purda
where
my
meal
awaited
me
and
zora
and
i
had
our
fingers
very
soon
buried
in
a
smoking
dish
of
kicheree
and
a
very
good
currie
while
i
was
thus
employed
i
heard
the
usual
salutation
pass
between
bhudrinath
and
his
acquaintance
and
when
i
had
satisfied
the
cravings
within
me
which
had
been
grievous
to
bear
i
joined
them
this
is
my
brother
of
whom
i
have
spoken
to
you
said
bhudrinath
presenting
me
to
him
he
has
now
as
you
see
overtaken
me
and
we
shall
journey
on
together
all
his
men
are
encamped
outside
the
town
but
as
he
is
more
comfortable
with
me
you
see
him
here
we
exchanged
salutations
and
by
way
of
drawing
him
to
the
subject
i
asked
bhudrinath
when
we
should
start
i
can
not
delay
said
i
that
detention
at
nursee
was
most
inconvenient
and
but
for
that
we
should
have
been
far
on
the
road
by
this
time
the
man
stared
at
me
and
at
last
said
to
bhudrinath
surely
you
must
be
joking
when
you
say
this
gentleman
is
your
brother
why
you
are
much
older
and
your
features
do
not
resemble
in
the
least
we
are
not
real
brothers
he
replied
but
cousins
you
know
that
cousins
usually
call
themselves
brothers
but
how
comes
it
said
he
that
he
is
the
jemadar
of
your
men
and
not
you
who
are
the
eldest
why
it
is
a
long
story
and
would
not
interest
you
said
bhudrinath
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
is
the
son
of
the
elder
branch
who
married
long
after
my
father
having
lost
his
first
wife
so
by
the
consent
of
the
family
and
my
own
he
was
declared
leader
though
he
must
confess
i
am
his
adviser
i
pretended
to
be
ashamed
of
my
dignity
and
allowed
though
i
was
nominally
superior
yet
that
i
could
not
get
on
at
all
without
my
well
said
the
man
you
have
curious
customs
in
your
country
but
in
every
one
they
differ
here
your
relative
situations
would
be
reversed
and
so
i
suppose
i
must
treat
with
you
jemadar
sahib
i
dare
say
your
cousin
has
told
you
all
about
me
he
has
said
i
at
least
as
much
as
you
have
told
him
but
we
are
both
present
and
what
you
say
to
one
equally
concerns
the
other
so
i
pray
you
speak
on
without
reservation
i
will
not
then
recur
to
the
past
said
the
man
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
have
every
reason
to
wish
to
get
out
of
this
place
as
far
as
hyderabad
there
i
shall
be
secure
from
my
enemies
i
therefore
propose
to
accompany
you
if
you
will
guarantee
me
protection
and
concealment
on
the
road
we
are
ready
to
do
that
said
i
but
you
will
allow
we
shall
run
some
risk
for
besides
protection
and
concealment
upon
the
road
we
must
defend
you
if
necessary
and
all
this
requires
some
recompense
true
and
i
am
in
no
condition
to
drive
a
bargain
therefore
you
must
name
your
own
terms
you
are
liberal
i
see
i
rejoined
and
you
shall
find
us
to
be
so
also
perhaps
one
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
will
not
be
thought
by
you
exorbitant
it
is
not
half
i
will
pay
you
now
and
the
other
half
when
we
arrive
agreed
said
i
it
is
satisfactory
and
now
say
how
you
intend
to
travel
if
i
have
permission
i
would
advise
a
mode
which
would
be
certain
to
escape
detection
what
is
it
cried
he
eagerly
that
you
should
hire
or
buy
a
cart
and
travel
in
it
at
any
rate
for
a
few
marches
my
brother
has
his
zenana
with
him
and
you
could
not
be
discovered
no
one
would
dare
to
search
a
cart
which
held
females
by
alla
it
is
a
rare
plan
said
the
man
i
wonder
it
never
entered
into
my
head
yet
cart
i
have
none
and
how
to
get
one
without
giving
a
clue
to
my
flight
do
not
distress
yourself
about
it
said
bhudrinath
furnish
us
with
the
money
about
one
hundred
rupees
will
be
enough
and
i
will
go
and
purchase
one
and
account
to
you
for
whatever
may
be
over
and
my
camels
and
horses
and
servants
said
the
man
what
can
be
done
with
them
how
many
of
them
are
there
i
asked
there
are
two
camels
and
two
horses
and
i
have
three
or
four
servants
whom
i
wish
to
accompany
me
then
send
them
all
to
our
camp
at
night
said
i
they
will
not
be
seen
and
if
necessary
they
can
be
sent
on
a
march
you
are
a
people
cried
he
and
what
has
cost
me
days
and
nights
of
anxiety
you
have
settled
satisfactorily
in
a
few
moments
now
i
clearly
see
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
and
i
go
to
bring
the
money
and
give
directions
to
my
people
so
he
left
us
well
done
cried
bhudrinath
to
me
you
fairly
took
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
and
i
think
the
fish
has
taken
the
bait
i
think
so
too
said
i
the
fellow
may
be
a
very
sharp
revenue
collector
but
he
is
no
match
for
you
and
me
and
you
see
he
is
a
greater
man
than
we
thought
for
as
he
speaks
of
his
horses
camels
and
servants
no
doubt
we
shall
have
a
good
round
sum
from
him
i
hurried
to
my
father
leaving
bhudrinath
to
manage
everything
his
own
way
if
i
should
not
return
in
time
to
meet
the
man
we
expected
he
was
surprised
to
see
me
and
exclaimed
i
did
not
think
you
would
have
left
your
adored
so
soon
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
early
visit
nay
said
i
father
do
not
mention
her
it
sounds
like
banter
and
i
have
other
work
in
hand
just
now
than
attending
even
to
zora
ay
indeed
and
now
tell
me
my
son
what
thou
hast
in
view
why
said
i
bhudrinath
and
i
have
secured
a
man
in
the
town
who
promises
to
be
almost
as
good
a
prize
as
either
we
have
had
before
and
when
you
see
two
horses
some
camels
and
servants
come
into
your
camp
this
evening
do
you
allow
them
to
remain
and
start
them
off
as
early
as
may
be
morning
towards
hyderabad
i
will
do
as
you
wish
said
my
father
but
tell
me
ameer
ali
what
is
this
you
are
about
are
you
sure
there
is
no
risk
no
danger
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
not
but
hear
what
has
been
done
already
and
then
judge
whether
the
matter
ought
to
be
persevered
in
or
not
if
you
do
not
like
it
we
will
drop
it
at
once
so
i
told
him
all
you
are
both
of
you
doing
your
work
well
and
i
approve
of
it
greatly
said
the
old
man
i
will
on
my
part
receive
the
camels
and
will
send
on
a
party
of
gravediggers
this
very
night
we
will
set
off
night
or
early
the
next
morning
bhudrinath
was
absent
when
i
reached
the
house
in
the
town
and
i
had
to
wait
a
long
time
for
his
return
which
was
not
till
near
evening
however
i
had
the
society
i
best
loved
and
the
hours
fled
quickly
i
was
nevertheless
overjoyed
to
see
him
return
with
a
cart
and
two
fine
bullocks
he
had
purchased
the
whole
from
a
set
of
and
the
cart
was
fitted
with
curtains
in
the
manner
of
those
used
to
carry
women
when
it
was
brought
up
to
the
house
he
dismissed
the
driver
with
a
small
present
there
said
bhudrinath
is
rupees
worth
and
the
concern
is
cheap
enough
our
only
care
is
now
for
the
person
who
is
to
ride
in
it
where
is
he
said
i
are
you
sure
of
him
as
sure
said
bhudrinath
as
i
ever
was
of
any
one
he
is
now
gone
to
take
leave
of
the
hakim
of
the
place
and
will
pretend
he
has
done
all
his
business
he
has
sent
his
camels
and
people
to
the
camp
with
strict
orders
to
obey
whoever
there
may
be
there
in
authority
and
i
myself
directed
them
to
go
to
your
father
and
receive
instructions
from
him
the
man
himself
will
be
here
at
nightfall
inshalla
cried
i
truly
may
we
say
we
are
fortunate
nothing
has
gone
wrong
just
as
we
had
completed
all
our
preparations
our
friend
came
and
by
this
time
it
had
become
quite
dark
so
that
he
joined
us
unobserved
and
as
we
had
sent
word
to
him
that
the
cart
had
been
purchased
he
brought
with
him
what
we
supposed
to
be
his
valuables
one
of
his
servants
carried
the
bundle
which
appeared
carefully
tied
up
in
waxed
cloths
and
his
hookah
and
his
bedding
are
you
sure
you
have
omitted
nothing
he
asked
certain
said
i
everything
is
ready
i
have
been
to
the
gate
and
have
told
the
guard
that
we
have
a
long
march
before
us
and
will
pass
out
a
little
after
midnight
with
two
carts
and
our
people
well
said
he
then
here
is
your
money
and
he
counted
out
rupees
to
me
now
we
have
nothing
to
desire
said
i
but
to
be
informed
of
your
name
which
hitherto
you
have
not
told
us
call
me
kumal
khan
for
the
present
he
replied
you
shall
know
my
real
name
at
hyderabad
as
you
will
said
i
doubtless
you
have
good
reasons
for
not
discovering
yourself
to
us
meanwhile
as
you
say
kumal
khan
will
do
as
well
as
any
other
name
therefore
khan
sahib
i
think
the
sooner
we
take
some
rest
the
more
we
shall
be
refreshed
for
our
journey
i
can
lie
down
anywhere
said
he
i
dare
say
i
shall
sleep
moreover
which
my
care
and
anxiety
have
prevented
my
doing
for
some
nights
past
he
spread
his
carpet
and
covered
himself
up
bhudrinath
followed
his
example
and
in
a
short
time
they
were
both
asleep
as
their
deep
breathing
testified
strange
destiny
i
thought
there
lies
the
man
who
has
but
a
few
hours
to
live
side
by
side
in
peaceful
slumber
with
one
who
will
be
actively
employed
in
his
destruction
a
few
hours
and
their
situations
will
be
changed
oh
how
changed
one
to
lie
senseless
in
the
earth
the
other
to
live
and
breathe
and
to
tax
his
wits
to
gain
fresh
victims
ya
alla
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
thy
purposes
are
inscrutable
we
were
roused
at
the
time
appointed
by
the
men
and
our
preparations
for
departure
quickly
completed
i
saw
zora
safely
deposited
in
her
cart
as
also
her
old
attendant
next
kumal
khan
in
his
and
putting
myself
at
the
head
of
the
party
we
were
soon
beyond
the
gates
of
the
town
and
at
the
encampment
here
i
sent
on
zora
cart
and
desired
one
of
the
men
to
come
back
and
give
us
due
notice
should
he
meet
the
tillaees
or
scouts
on
the
road
i
then
sought
out
my
father
and
inquired
whether
he
had
allotted
bhuttotes
and
shumsheas
persons
to
hold
the
hands
to
the
servants
and
grooms
i
have
settled
everything
he
replied
and
given
every
man
his
instructions
there
will
be
no
difficulty
if
all
is
ready
before
us
but
are
you
sure
that
kumal
khan
as
you
call
him
is
not
armed
he
has
a
sword
said
i
but
what
of
that
bhudrinath
and
i
will
easily
manage
him
and
he
will
not
be
on
his
guard
then
keep
well
behind
said
my
father
if
there
is
any
scuffle
he
will
not
hear
it
and
i
will
send
a
man
back
to
you
when
we
meet
the
first
of
the
scouts
you
can
then
do
as
you
please
either
bring
him
on
or
deal
with
him
there
as
you
like
very
good
said
i
we
will
be
guided
by
circumstances
i
saw
with
secret
exultation
how
beautifully
everything
had
been
arranged
as
our
men
and
our
acquaintance
servants
passed
me
to
every
one
of
them
was
attached
one
of
the
most
expert
bhuttotes
with
two
others
to
assist
if
necessary
yet
they
disposed
themselves
so
carelessly
that
suspicion
was
out
of
the
question
each
one
as
he
passed
threw
a
look
of
intelligence
towards
me
as
much
as
to
say
here
is
work
we
delight
in
and
i
felt
truly
excited
as
the
whole
band
was
before
me
their
arms
glancing
brightly
in
the
moonbeams
this
thought
i
is
the
joy
my
father
told
me
of
and
what
could
raise
such
feelings
within
me
in
the
common
plodding
pursuits
of
life
when
these
fellows
are
but
my
own
then
shall
the
name
of
ameer
ali
be
dreaded
and
feared
men
shall
wonder
at
it
many
a
timid
woman
heart
shall
beat
as
she
listens
to
stories
of
me
and
allows
her
fancy
to
picture
to
her
him
of
whom
she
hears
such
deeds
of
daring
bravery
yes
cried
i
aloud
for
i
could
not
control
myself
the
time
will
come
ay
and
soon
the
present
is
poor
work
to
what
i
have
thought
of
and
will
put
into
execution
the
voice
of
bhudrinath
recalled
my
ideas
in
the
name
of
narayun
and
all
the
gods
said
he
what
are
you
talking
about
come
we
wait
for
you
i
urged
my
horse
down
the
bank
and
was
with
him
in
an
instant
kumal
khan
put
his
head
out
of
the
curtains
and
asked
if
we
had
assembled
our
men
yes
said
i
they
are
all
before
us
except
my
cousin
myself
and
a
few
of
our
attendants
who
will
stay
round
you
that
is
right
said
he
i
shall
sleep
if
this
vile
jolting
will
let
me
oh
that
i
were
on
my
horse
instead
of
being
cooped
up
in
this
cart
patience
said
bhudrinath
i
dare
say
you
will
soon
be
out
of
it
again
that
i
shall
my
friend
said
he
when
i
dare
show
myself
and
so
saying
he
shut
the
curtains
bhudrinath
and
i
rode
on
some
time
in
silence
at
last
we
reached
a
rising
ground
which
apparently
led
down
to
the
bed
of
a
river
for
i
thought
i
saw
the
water
glistening
in
the
moon
rays
the
jungle
was
thicker
than
before
and
i
involuntarily
turned
to
bhudrinath
surely
this
is
the
spot
cried
i
we
must
wait
for
the
cart
for
we
had
preceded
it
a
long
way
we
had
better
do
so
he
replied
it
will
soon
be
up
we
had
just
heard
the
rumbling
sound
of
the
wheels
when
the
man
i
had
sent
on
with
it
came
up
to
us
what
news
i
asked
is
all
prepared
by
this
time
it
is
said
the
man
when
i
met
the
first
scout
i
returned
to
tell
you
they
have
fixed
on
a
beautiful
spot
and
i
doubt
not
that
the
band
are
waiting
for
you
having
done
their
share
of
the
night
adventure
well
said
i
we
do
want
you
here
so
go
on
again
but
he
begged
hard
to
remain
and
i
allowed
him
as
kumal
khan
passed
us
bhudrinath
gave
the
driver
the
signal
he
nodded
his
head
in
compliance
and
telling
the
men
who
were
to
hold
our
horses
to
be
near
and
in
readiness
we
got
behind
the
cart
and
followed
it
down
the
descent
about
down
the
bank
of
the
road
sloped
into
it
and
rose
into
a
small
eminence
i
marked
the
place
and
saw
that
the
driver
had
done
the
same
the
cart
gradually
diverged
from
the
track
one
wheel
went
up
the
bank
it
leaned
fearfully
over
and
at
last
came
down
with
a
terrible
crash
we
were
off
our
horses
in
an
instant
and
ran
up
kumal
khan
was
groaning
beneath
it
we
lifted
it
up
and
got
him
out
but
he
was
either
so
frightened
or
hurt
he
could
not
speak
at
last
he
recovered
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
a
volley
of
abuse
at
the
driver
look
cried
he
a
smooth
road
not
a
stone
or
a
pebble
and
yet
that
son
of
a
base
mother
must
needs
drive
up
yonder
bank
and
has
nearly
killed
me
he
shall
be
well
punished
for
his
carelessness
said
i
but
are
you
hurt
khan
my
right
arm
is
very
painful
said
he
holding
it
and
i
wish
to
alla
i
had
a
horse
to
ride
instead
of
going
further
in
that
concern
it
can
not
now
be
helped
said
bhudrinath
and
it
is
well
none
of
your
bones
were
broken
we
will
keep
nearer
you
in
future
and
see
that
the
fellow
drives
more
carefully
the
cart
had
been
by
this
time
set
fairly
in
the
road
again
and
kumal
khan
mattress
and
pillow
arranged
as
he
turned
away
from
us
and
laid
hold
of
one
of
the
posts
of
the
curtains
and
had
his
foot
on
the
wheel
to
get
in
i
threw
the
handkerchief
round
his
neck
what
what
is
this
was
all
that
escaped
him
the
rest
was
an
indistinct
gurgling
in
his
throat
for
an
instant
the
wrench
i
gave
to
his
neck
must
have
extinguished
life
for
he
relaxed
his
hold
of
the
post
and
fell
to
the
ground
without
sense
or
motion
neatly
and
cleverly
done
cried
bhudrinath
i
could
not
have
managed
it
better
myself
you
see
he
does
not
stir
he
is
dead
enough
now
meer
sahib
believe
that
a
man
can
be
killed
before
he
touches
the
ground
i
must
see
you
do
it
said
i
this
fellow
held
on
by
the
cart
for
some
moments
but
come
i
added
to
the
men
lift
the
body
into
the
cart
we
have
no
time
to
lose
they
bundled
it
in
and
we
set
off
as
rapidly
as
the
bullocks
could
trot
what
if
he
should
revive
with
this
jolting
said
i
to
bhudrinath
never
fear
he
replied
if
he
does
he
will
only
have
to
be
killed
over
again
but
depend
upon
it
he
is
dead
enough
no
man
ever
survived
the
wrench
you
gave
him
his
neck
is
broken
the
old
gooroo
has
taught
you
well
i
see
plainly
i
own
i
feel
more
confidence
every
time
i
do
it
said
i
and
i
should
not
care
if
even
now
i
had
one
or
two
more
fellows
to
try
my
hand
upon
nay
said
bhudrinath
laughing
rest
you
content
with
what
we
have
done
see
we
are
at
the
bhil
and
yonder
is
the
whole
band
collected
we
rode
up
to
the
spot
and
the
first
inquiry
was
from
my
father
have
you
brought
him
yes
said
i
the
earth
that
held
him
is
in
the
cart
did
do
it
he
eagerly
asked
of
bhudrinath
and
pointed
to
me
ay
did
he
he
replied
and
most
properly
too
he
had
him
all
to
himself
i
did
not
interfere
cried
my
father
he
is
a
worthy
son
come
continued
he
to
all
the
men
do
not
loiter
here
but
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
the
we
will
follow
and
i
dare
say
overtake
you
seeing
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
i
pushed
on
to
the
river
the
godavery
and
finding
that
all
had
been
ferried
over
i
urged
on
my
horse
to
overtake
zora
cart
for
i
knew
not
what
she
would
think
of
my
absence
nor
how
i
could
well
account
to
her
for
it
satisfactorily
but
i
trusted
to
chance
to
frame
some
excuse
i
passed
the
men
who
were
straggling
along
in
parties
of
ten
or
twelve
but
still
i
did
not
see
the
cart
though
i
had
desired
those
who
were
in
charge
of
it
not
to
drive
fast
i
became
anxious
and
urged
my
horse
into
a
gallop
well
it
was
that
i
did
so
for
when
i
had
proceeded
some
distance
i
heard
a
confused
clamour
before
me
could
she
have
been
attacked
by
thieves
was
my
instant
thought
it
was
probable
for
the
road
was
narrow
and
the
jungle
thick
on
both
sides
and
seeing
the
few
men
with
the
cart
thieves
might
have
surprised
them
i
drew
my
sword
to
be
prepared
as
the
noise
and
screams
seemed
to
increase
and
a
few
moments
more
arrived
at
the
spot
there
indeed
was
a
scene
of
violence
the
moon
was
still
shining
brightly
and
i
could
see
all
before
me
the
cart
was
surrounded
by
the
five
or
six
men
i
had
sent
on
with
it
and
who
were
defending
their
charge
bravely
two
of
the
robbers
as
i
supposed
were
stretched
on
the
ground
the
rest
were
aiming
cuts
at
my
men
which
they
parried
but
just
as
i
got
up
one
of
my
men
fell
and
the
rest
looked
exhausted
i
suspect
neither
party
observed
my
arrival
so
intent
were
they
on
their
own
proceedings
and
i
could
see
that
my
cry
of
bismilla
accompanied
by
a
cut
which
struck
down
one
of
the
robbers
was
as
startling
to
them
as
unexpected
while
my
faithful
men
who
now
saw
me
plainly
set
up
a
shout
and
attacked
their
opposers
with
renewed
spirit
the
scuffle
lasted
only
a
few
moments
longer
throwing
myself
from
my
horse
i
drew
my
pistol
from
my
girdle
and
discharged
it
at
a
thief
who
was
coming
up
to
me
with
his
sword
uplifted
the
ball
passed
through
his
body
and
he
fell
on
this
the
rest
of
the
band
turned
and
fled
we
pursued
them
for
a
short
distance
and
secured
a
youth
who
was
one
of
them
the
rest
got
clear
off
chapter
xii
when
we
returned
to
the
cart
my
first
business
was
to
soothe
my
poor
zora
whose
screams
added
to
those
of
the
old
attendant
and
the
oaths
execrations
and
shouts
of
the
contending
parties
had
made
a
din
which
defies
description
i
found
her
terribly
alarmed
of
course
but
the
rascals
had
not
been
suffered
to
approach
her
and
when
she
was
assured
by
me
that
i
should
not
again
quit
her
side
she
was
calm
and
gave
me
a
history
of
the
attack
which
was
that
as
they
were
going
along
the
thieves
began
to
pelt
them
with
stones
from
the
bushes
on
the
sides
of
the
road
and
at
last
perhaps
not
thinking
them
armed
rushed
from
their
concealment
and
the
fight
began
the
wounded
thief
was
unable
to
walk
so
he
was
put
into
the
cart
with
the
dead
body
the
boy
arms
were
tied
behind
his
back
and
a
cord
passed
round
his
neck
i
tied
to
my
own
saddle
leaving
twenty
men
to
guard
the
wounded
we
then
quickly
proceeded
we
arrived
at
a
large
village
before
the
sun
rose
but
the
villagers
were
up
and
the
herds
of
cattle
were
pouring
out
of
the
gates
on
their
way
to
the
pastures
we
desired
the
men
to
take
up
the
encampment
under
some
tamarind
trees
and
my
father
myself
and
bhudrinath
went
to
the
gates
and
desired
to
see
the
patail
or
whoever
might
be
the
chief
authority
after
waiting
a
long
time
we
were
told
that
the
aumil
expected
us
and
were
ushered
into
his
house
where
he
sat
in
a
verandah
apparently
used
by
him
generally
to
transact
business
in
he
was
a
hindoo
a
khayet
by
caste
and
as
those
persons
usually
are
was
polite
and
courteous
in
his
manners
my
father
was
spokesman
on
this
occasion
and
after
introducing
himself
as
a
merchant
and
us
as
leaders
of
the
men
who
escorted
him
the
old
oomerkhér
story
he
told
him
of
the
attack
which
had
been
made
on
us
of
which
however
he
seemed
for
a
time
to
be
perfectly
incredulous
impossible
said
he
there
has
not
been
a
highway
robbery
or
an
attempt
at
one
for
years
ever
since
some
notorious
thieves
were
caught
and
beheaded
here
you
must
be
under
some
mistake
you
have
not
mentioned
our
wounded
men
and
that
several
of
the
thieves
have
been
killed
by
us
said
i
to
my
father
perhaps
this
worthy
gentleman
will
believe
us
when
he
sees
them
or
finds
the
bodies
of
the
rascals
and
again
you
forget
that
two
of
them
are
in
our
custody
indeed
cried
the
aumil
that
alters
the
case
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
so
many
travellers
beg
for
escorts
from
village
to
village
and
set
forth
their
having
been
threatened
between
here
and
nirmul
that
i
am
become
difficult
to
satisfy
or
to
be
persuaded
that
any
danger
has
existed
we
require
no
escort
said
my
father
we
are
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
ourselves
having
as
you
have
heard
beaten
off
these
thieves
all
we
want
is
a
few
men
to
bring
up
our
wounded
and
justice
done
on
the
rascals
we
have
caught
it
would
be
well
for
us
said
mohun
lall
if
all
travellers
were
to
defend
themselves
like
you
we
should
have
but
few
thieves
in
the
country
for
they
would
find
theirs
a
losing
trade
but
i
think
you
said
you
had
one
of
them
unhurt
where
is
he
we
may
perhaps
get
something
out
of
him
i
sent
for
the
lad
and
he
was
questioned
for
some
time
about
the
gang
and
where
it
was
probable
they
had
gone
but
he
would
not
answer
a
word
and
the
man
who
was
interpreting
for
us
gave
up
questioning
him
in
despair
he
will
not
say
a
word
in
this
manner
said
bhudrinath
give
him
the
lash
i
dare
say
that
will
make
him
speak
true
said
mohun
lall
i
was
going
to
send
for
a
korla
and
he
called
to
one
of
his
men
to
bring
one
the
thief
shuddered
as
he
saw
it
and
was
again
asked
if
he
would
confess
but
he
remained
silent
throw
him
down
cried
mohun
lall
and
cut
the
skin
from
his
back
in
an
instant
he
was
thrown
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
the
lash
wielded
by
a
stout
fellow
brought
blood
at
almost
every
stroke
but
in
vain
he
would
not
speak
a
word
not
even
a
cry
for
mercy
this
is
of
no
use
either
said
one
of
the
men
who
held
him
get
a
bag
full
of
ashes
i
warrant
he
speaks
fast
enough
when
that
is
put
over
his
face
a
leather
bag
such
as
is
used
to
give
grain
to
horses
was
filled
with
ashes
and
brought
it
was
tied
over
his
mouth
and
at
the
same
time
he
received
some
hard
thumps
on
his
back
to
force
him
to
breathe
this
apparently
had
the
desired
effect
for
after
a
short
time
during
which
the
torture
must
have
been
great
he
muttered
something
and
the
bag
was
withdrawn
you
think
to
make
me
confess
said
the
rascal
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
but
it
is
in
vain
i
know
well
where
my
people
are
gone
and
i
curse
the
authors
of
their
discomfiture
and
he
poured
a
torrent
of
abuse
on
me
yes
continued
he
pointing
to
me
it
was
you
who
struck
down
my
father
and
as
he
is
dead
i
want
no
more
than
to
die
also
you
may
hang
me
as
soon
as
you
please
ha
said
mohun
lall
i
had
forgotten
him
let
him
be
brought
i
had
left
the
fellow
badly
wounded
but
did
not
think
there
was
any
danger
of
his
life
when
he
arrived
however
carried
on
a
bed
it
was
evident
he
was
dying
he
scarcely
breathed
and
the
rattle
was
in
his
throat
we
did
not
therefore
trouble
ourselves
further
about
him
but
endeavoured
to
make
the
son
confess
the
whip
and
hot
ashes
were
both
resorted
to
again
without
effect
and
all
our
endeavours
only
produced
fresh
execrations
and
abuse
there
is
no
bearing
this
any
longer
cried
mohun
lall
the
fellow
must
be
hanged
i
know
these
rascals
and
were
we
to
keep
him
for
a
year
we
should
never
get
a
word
of
intelligence
out
of
him
so
there
is
no
use
in
delay
as
you
will
said
my
father
perhaps
he
will
confess
when
the
rope
is
round
his
neck
we
shall
see
replied
mohun
lall
but
i
do
not
think
it
send
for
the
mangs
these
wretches
everywhere
the
vilest
of
mankind
were
soon
present
and
the
thief
was
made
over
to
them
you
see
said
mohun
lall
to
him
you
have
no
chance
of
escape
will
you
now
confess
and
take
service
with
me
i
will
protect
you
the
fellow
hesitated
looked
at
his
father
and
appeared
irresolute
but
a
second
glance
at
his
expiring
parent
again
rallied
him
not
for
all
the
wealth
you
could
give
me
cried
he
drawing
himself
up
and
looking
at
us
proudly
had
been
alive
and
in
your
power
i
might
have
taken
your
service
but
you
could
not
protect
me
now
and
i
would
rather
die
by
the
hands
of
your
people
than
by
those
of
my
associates
from
whom
i
could
not
escape
away
with
him
cried
mohun
lall
to
the
mangs
see
that
you
do
your
work
properly
and
our
mamool
customary
present
maharaj
you
must
not
forgot
that
no
no
cried
he
but
away
with
ye
i
am
polluted
by
your
presence
go
to
the
kotwal
after
you
have
done
and
he
will
have
received
orders
to
give
you
a
sheep
and
as
much
liquor
as
will
make
you
all
drunk
the
fellows
made
many
most
profound
salams
and
went
off
with
their
wretched
companion
where
will
they
hang
him
said
i
i
should
like
to
see
him
again
and
try
if
i
ca
persuade
him
to
live
to
become
a
decent
fellow
somewhere
beyond
the
gate
said
mohun
lall
i
do
not
know
the
place
myself
but
my
people
will
show
you
you
will
do
little
good
however
i
am
afraid
and
after
all
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
about
him
it
is
no
trouble
i
replied
i
have
simply
a
curiosity
upon
the
subject
and
will
see
the
last
of
him
i
will
accompany
you
said
bhudrinath
and
we
took
our
leave
and
followed
the
executioners
about
an
arrow
flight
from
the
gate
were
two
scraggy
gnarled
and
almost
leafless
beneath
which
stood
the
group
we
sought
and
round
them
all
the
urchins
and
idle
men
of
the
village
we
hastened
up
to
them
and
found
that
everything
was
prepared
a
rope
with
a
noose
in
it
hung
over
a
branch
and
one
of
the
mangs
was
coolly
sharpening
a
knife
upon
an
old
stone
idol
which
lay
beneath
the
tree
for
what
purpose
i
could
not
make
out
however
my
business
was
not
with
them
but
with
the
wretch
who
was
so
near
his
death
he
had
seen
us
approach
and
i
thought
was
urging
the
mangs
to
despatch
him
before
we
came
up
but
they
did
not
do
so
as
they
imagined
we
brought
some
other
orders
to
them
i
addressed
myself
to
the
robber
will
you
not
live
said
i
so
young
as
you
are
have
you
no
love
of
life
i
now
again
promise
you
protection
if
you
will
confess
as
you
have
been
asked
to
do
before
let
the
cords
be
somewhat
loosened
which
bind
my
arms
said
the
robber
and
i
will
speak
to
you
at
present
i
am
in
too
much
pain
to
talk
loosen
them
said
i
to
the
mangs
and
one
of
you
hold
the
rope
in
case
he
attempts
to
escape
the
robber
smiled
faintly
at
what
i
said
and
continued
you
have
taken
an
interest
in
me
and
although
i
owe
my
present
condition
to
you
yet
sooner
or
later
i
should
have
come
to
the
same
end
or
fallen
by
some
shot
or
cut
of
a
sword
therefore
i
forgive
you
my
death
but
again
i
repeat
i
have
no
wish
to
live
nor
miserable
as
i
am
can
you
suppose
i
would
purchase
my
life
by
an
act
of
treachery
to
my
companions
had
my
father
lived
and
remained
in
mohun
lall
power
i
would
have
promised
anything
but
he
is
dead
my
uncle
too
fell
by
the
hands
of
one
of
your
men
in
the
attack
on
your
cart
and
whom
have
i
left
in
this
world
to
care
for
that
i
should
live
one
day
has
seen
the
end
of
my
family
and
it
was
our
fate
yet
bear
to
mohun
lall
my
hate
and
the
curses
of
a
dying
man
it
is
he
who
has
killed
me
and
for
this
he
will
have
to
pay
a
fearful
retribution
and
now
said
he
turning
to
the
mangs
do
your
horrible
office
i
have
no
more
to
say
i
was
going
to
speak
again
but
bhudrinath
stopped
me
what
is
the
use
said
he
the
fellow
is
obstinate
and
depend
upon
it
if
he
were
spared
it
would
only
be
to
lead
good
men
into
danger
if
not
into
destruction
let
him
die
he
deserves
it
the
mangs
looked
to
me
for
orders
and
i
told
them
to
proceed
it
was
clearly
of
no
use
to
delay
the
robber
was
again
tightly
pinioned
and
thrown
on
the
ground
and
the
mang
who
held
the
knife
he
had
been
sharpening
dexterously
cut
both
sinews
of
his
legs
close
above
the
heel
he
was
then
raised
up
the
noose
put
round
his
neck
and
in
another
instant
he
was
pulled
up
to
the
branch
and
struggling
in
his
death
agony
pah
said
bhudrinath
turning
away
it
makes
me
sick
what
a
contrast
this
is
to
our
work
where
he
who
is
to
die
scarcely
knows
that
the
handkerchief
is
about
his
neck
before
he
is
a
dead
man
you
say
truly
said
i
we
have
the
advantage
but
these
mangs
are
miserable
outcast
wretches
what
else
could
you
expect
from
them
now
let
us
go
to
the
camp
my
father
will
be
there
and
we
will
see
what
this
kumal
khan
had
with
him
when
we
arrived
we
found
that
all
his
baggage
had
been
examined
there
were
two
boxes
the
contents
of
which
we
looked
to
see
with
some
impatience
one
was
nearly
filled
with
papers
relating
to
his
business
as
a
and
these
were
burned
as
fast
as
they
could
be
looked
over
by
me
in
the
bottom
however
was
a
bag
filled
with
gold
which
bhudrinath
held
up
in
triumph
this
is
something
better
than
musty
paper
said
he
putting
it
on
one
side
now
for
the
other
box
it
was
broken
open
and
proved
a
rich
prize
indeed
after
the
clothes
with
which
the
top
was
covered
had
been
removed
a
number
of
bars
of
silver
met
our
expecting
eyes
the
box
was
not
however
emptied
and
under
another
layer
of
clothes
were
ten
bars
of
gold
of
the
same
size
as
the
silver
ones
here
is
the
cream
of
the
matter
cried
bhudrinath
as
he
took
up
the
first
alla
knows
how
much
there
is
but
it
is
clear
the
man
was
worth
killing
and
finely
indeed
must
he
have
plundered
the
unfortunate
cultivators
the
bars
of
gold
and
silver
were
made
over
to
my
father
to
be
placed
among
the
other
plunder
we
had
got
and
all
that
now
remained
to
be
seen
were
the
clothes
he
had
worn
and
his
there
was
not
however
much
in
it
stay
said
bhudrinath
here
is
another
bundle
which
was
in
the
humeanah
i
took
it
from
him
and
unrolled
fold
after
fold
of
clean
paper
why
there
is
nothing
here
said
i
i
suppose
he
kept
this
to
write
on
go
on
to
the
end
nevertheless
said
my
father
let
us
see
all
after
removing
three
more
folds
i
came
to
another
small
packet
which
was
tied
up
with
thread
here
is
something
at
last
said
i
breaking
it
open
bills
of
exchange
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
prophet
and
i
doubt
not
of
value
too
have
we
any
one
who
can
make
them
out
i
can
not
read
the
writing
said
bhudrinath
but
i
can
make
out
the
figures
if
they
are
not
written
in
persian
ah
no
said
i
they
are
nagree
or
guzerattee
so
try
your
skill
this
said
bhudrinath
after
examining
one
is
for
two
thousand
rupees
see
these
are
the
figures
i
dare
say
you
are
right
said
i
handing
the
rest
to
him
what
are
these
for
here
is
a
second
for
four
hundred
not
much
said
my
father
but
go
on
the
third
is
for
let
me
see
again
said
bhudrinath
ah
i
am
right
it
is
for
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
the
last
is
for
two
hundred
and
forty
that
is
let
me
see
said
i
four
thousand
eight
hundred
and
forty
well
we
have
got
a
good
prize
yes
cried
my
father
we
should
be
well
off
if
they
were
worth
anything
to
us
but
they
are
no
better
than
the
waste
paper
we
have
burned
how
said
i
we
should
get
the
money
if
we
presented
them
surely
you
do
not
reflect
said
my
father
that
if
we
did
so
it
would
lead
to
our
detection
in
this
matter
so
destroy
them
indeed
said
i
i
will
not
but
will
keep
them
for
stolen
money
and
i
dare
say
were
we
to
affect
to
be
this
kumal
khan
agents
we
might
get
the
amount
as
you
will
said
my
father
but
remember
you
take
no
steps
about
them
without
consulting
me
so
i
kept
them
and
had
afterwards
reason
to
be
glad
that
i
had
done
so
chapter
xiii
as
we
were
to
leave
the
village
the
next
morning
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
and
take
leave
of
mohun
lall
and
accordingly
went
to
his
house
in
the
evening
so
you
could
make
nothing
of
that
rascal
who
was
hung
up
said
he
when
we
were
seated
these
thieves
are
hardened
vagabonds
and
though
i
have
hung
several
in
this
way
i
have
never
been
able
to
get
anything
out
of
them
i
could
not
said
i
the
fellow
was
as
he
called
it
faithful
and
died
worthy
of
a
better
cause
it
is
no
use
of
speaking
of
him
said
mohun
lall
the
fellow
is
dead
and
i
would
that
all
his
brethren
were
hanging
as
high
as
he
is
but
i
have
heard
a
strange
piece
of
news
since
you
left
me
meer
sahib
which
i
do
not
care
telling
you
and
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
give
me
some
assistance
command
me
said
i
anything
that
i
can
do
will
be
but
a
poor
return
for
your
attention
the
matter
is
this
said
he
a
person
by
name
syud
mahomed
ali
who
is
very
respectably
connected
at
hyderabad
came
from
the
city
with
letters
to
the
governor
of
nirmul
two
or
three
years
ago
directing
him
to
be
employed
as
a
collector
of
any
small
district
which
might
become
vacant
he
lived
some
time
with
him
and
when
an
opportunity
offered
was
appointed
by
him
his
naib
or
deputy
in
a
district
not
far
from
nirmul
latterly
the
governor
has
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
remit
the
revenue
collections
and
one
or
two
complaints
which
reached
him
privately
made
him
suspicious
this
feeling
was
increased
by
hearing
that
he
had
sent
off
his
baggage
in
a
clandestine
manner
whither
no
one
knew
and
this
morning
both
he
and
his
people
have
suddenly
disappeared
it
is
most
extraordinary
said
i
but
as
i
never
heard
of
this
person
before
i
do
not
see
exactly
how
i
am
to
be
of
any
use
to
you
or
your
friend
it
is
only
a
chance
that
you
may
be
so
said
mohun
lall
and
my
request
is
that
you
keep
a
look
out
for
him
during
your
journey
and
should
you
meet
him
that
you
will
arrest
him
instantly
and
send
him
to
me
under
an
escort
of
your
people
to
whom
i
promise
a
handsome
reward
for
their
delay
and
trouble
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
that
on
many
occasions
he
has
assumed
the
name
of
kumal
khan
the
name
i
believe
of
a
relative
of
his
who
adopted
him
and
perhaps
he
may
have
taken
this
name
in
travelling
i
will
not
forget
it
said
i
and
you
may
depend
upon
my
doing
my
utmost
to
secure
him
should
i
fall
in
with
him
and
could
you
give
me
a
paper
relating
his
delinquencies
under
your
own
seal
to
serve
me
as
a
kind
of
authority
for
arresting
him
certainly
said
mohun
lall
your
thought
is
a
good
one
i
will
forthwith
write
one
myself
so
saying
he
drew
up
the
document
and
handed
it
to
me
i
am
an
indifferent
scholar
said
i
but
i
dare
say
i
can
make
it
out
and
taking
the
paper
i
read
what
he
had
written
which
was
in
substance
what
he
had
told
me
and
now
i
pray
you
to
give
me
my
dismissal
for
i
have
business
among
my
people
and
the
day
is
nigh
closed
i
will
not
detain
you
said
mohun
lall
and
if
there
is
anything
you
or
your
people
want
which
my
poor
village
can
afford
you
have
only
to
send
for
it
i
shall
write
too
to
my
friend
to
tell
him
of
the
arrangement
i
have
made
and
the
confidence
i
have
in
you
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
said
i
and
should
i
want
anything
more
i
will
not
scruple
to
send
for
it
salam
sahib
salam
he
returned
i
wish
you
a
safe
journey
and
a
successful
one
thanks
again
to
you
good
aumil
for
your
last
words
said
i
to
myself
as
i
went
away
inshalla
it
will
be
as
successful
as
it
has
hitherto
been
well
indeed
mahomed
ali
has
met
his
deserts
and
it
is
better
perhaps
for
him
that
he
lies
cold
and
dead
as
he
is
than
that
he
should
have
lived
to
be
haunted
by
an
evil
conscience
and
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
he
has
cheated
and
deceived
who
would
have
tortured
him
to
death
if
they
had
not
immured
him
in
a
miserable
prison
to
pine
out
the
remainder
of
his
days
verily
a
good
deal
has
been
done
and
my
old
father
will
laugh
heartily
when
he
hears
how
i
have
behaved
and
how
i
have
baffled
suspicion
by
the
commission
i
have
brought
with
me
of
which
these
papers
are
good
proof
i
have
got
his
true
name
too
and
it
is
hard
if
with
this
clue
i
do
not
get
hold
of
the
money
for
the
bills
of
exchange
which
my
sagacious
parent
would
have
destroyed
shabash
ameer
ali
do
thou
go
on
in
this
way
and
whose
dog
is
he
who
shall
compete
with
thee
either
in
cunning
or
in
daring
as
i
thought
he
would
my
father
laughed
heartily
at
the
business
i
had
undertaken
it
would
be
a
good
joke
he
said
to
send
for
kumal
khan
head
and
put
it
at
the
gate
of
the
village
they
would
then
be
at
rest
about
him
and
mohun
lall
friend
would
be
obliged
to
disgorge
a
little
of
the
coin
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
helped
himself
to
out
of
the
revenue
by
alla
said
i
it
is
an
excellent
thought
and
i
will
send
a
couple
of
lughaees
to
bring
it
no
no
said
my
father
i
did
but
jest
it
is
now
nearly
evening
and
it
would
not
do
to
risk
them
on
that
lonely
road
at
nightfall
besides
they
could
not
well
be
back
before
we
start
as
you
will
said
i
but
at
the
same
time
i
made
an
inward
determination
to
mention
it
to
one
or
two
of
them
when
i
reached
my
tent
i
sent
for
three
lughaees
enterprising
fellows
now
said
i
my
lads
i
have
got
an
adventure
for
you
and
here
are
five
rupees
apiece
if
you
will
do
it
your
commands
are
on
our
heads
and
eyes
said
they
you
have
only
to
order
us
and
we
will
perform
your
wishes
well
then
said
i
what
i
want
is
the
head
of
kumal
khan
do
you
know
the
place
you
put
him
in
and
is
the
grave
deep
we
know
the
spot
exactly
said
one
of
them
a
hindoo
by
name
what
lugha
ever
forgot
a
spot
where
he
had
buried
any
one
the
grave
is
not
deep
and
he
is
at
the
top
of
all
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
head
and
why
is
it
wanted
i
detailed
to
them
what
mohun
lall
had
said
and
repeated
what
a
good
joke
it
would
be
to
get
the
head
and
place
it
in
some
conspicuous
place
then
said
if
i
may
offer
advice
i
recommend
its
being
put
under
the
tree
whereon
the
thief
was
hung
this
morning
the
worthy
aumil
will
think
kumal
khan
has
fallen
by
the
hands
of
some
of
his
gang
a
capital
idea
said
i
and
therefore
if
you
find
no
one
about
when
you
return
place
it
there
for
i
have
no
wish
to
look
at
it
it
shall
be
done
to
your
satisfaction
said
all
three
and
we
will
start
immediately
so
they
left
me
yet
i
was
in
dread
all
the
time
they
were
absent
lest
anything
should
befall
them
and
i
often
wished
i
had
not
sent
them
on
such
an
errand
but
it
was
too
late
and
i
could
not
recall
them
anxiously
and
sleeplessly
did
the
hours
pass
till
near
midnight
and
poor
zora
could
not
imagine
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
excused
myself
to
her
however
on
the
plea
of
having
a
headache
and
feeling
unwell
and
suffered
her
and
the
old
woman
to
put
quicklime
on
my
temples
and
use
other
remedies
which
she
said
were
infallible
in
such
cases
and
at
last
pretending
i
was
going
to
sleep
she
lay
down
and
was
soon
really
so
it
was
about
midnight
that
i
was
relieved
from
my
suspense
and
gladly
did
i
hear
the
voice
of
at
my
tent
door
calling
to
me
i
arose
and
went
out
is
all
safe
i
eagerly
asked
all
is
safe
said
he
and
we
have
brought
the
head
and
put
it
where
you
told
us
it
was
well
we
went
for
we
found
a
troop
of
jackals
busily
scratching
at
the
grave
and
they
would
have
got
to
the
bodies
before
morning
for
they
had
made
a
large
hole
when
we
arrived
however
we
scared
them
away
and
put
a
quantity
of
dry
thorns
just
under
the
earth
on
the
top
they
will
not
try
it
again
and
if
they
do
it
does
not
matter
as
no
one
will
ever
find
that
spot
it
was
too
well
chosen
you
have
done
your
work
well
and
bravely
said
i
and
you
shall
have
your
money
morning
they
left
me
and
the
excitement
past
i
lay
down
and
slept
soundly
the
next
morning
we
rose
before
day
the
omens
were
consulted
and
proved
favourable
and
all
prepared
for
prosecuting
our
march
we
were
soon
ready
and
finding
that
zora
was
comfortable
in
her
cart
and
that
she
needed
nothing
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
going
as
far
as
the
tree
where
the
thief
had
been
hung
to
see
whether
in
reality
the
head
of
kumal
khan
had
been
brought
accordingly
i
separated
from
the
party
and
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
to
the
spot
which
was
not
far
distant
i
know
not
why
but
an
involuntary
shudder
crept
over
me
as
i
reached
the
tree
and
looked
about
for
the
object
of
my
search
the
wind
which
had
been
still
all
night
suddenly
rose
with
the
breaking
day
and
its
first
sigh
through
the
withered
branches
of
the
neem
almost
seemed
to
have
a
voice
in
it
a
deprecation
of
the
deed
we
had
done
the
night
before
and
of
which
so
foul
an
evidence
as
that
before
me
was
present
for
at
that
instant
my
eyes
fell
on
the
head
which
had
been
placed
on
a
projecting
knot
of
the
trunk
to
protect
it
from
the
jackals
i
recoiled
from
it
with
loathing
for
the
eyes
were
protruding
from
the
sockets
and
the
mouth
open
and
the
expression
of
the
features
was
hideous
in
the
extreme
i
gazed
at
it
for
a
moment
this
must
not
be
said
i
those
eyes
will
betray
us
so
taking
the
cold
head
down
i
forced
them
into
their
sockets
and
shut
the
eyelids
which
i
was
able
to
do
as
the
stillness
of
death
was
past
i
then
placed
the
head
on
a
large
stone
close
to
the
tree
on
which
some
rude
idol
was
sculptured
and
quitting
the
place
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
to
a
small
puddle
i
had
passed
as
i
came
in
which
i
cleansed
my
hands
from
the
blood
which
had
adhered
to
them
alla
be
praised
they
are
pure
again
said
i
inwardly
as
i
washed
them
eagerly
with
some
earth
and
water
brave
as
i
know
myself
to
be
and
caring
for
nothing
alive
i
would
not
have
gone
with
and
his
people
have
dug
up
that
body
and
decollated
it
no
not
for
the
wealth
of
delhi
pah
the
idea
is
horrible
and
i
arose
and
ran
again
at
my
utmost
speed
till
i
reached
the
party
my
absence
had
not
been
remarked
which
was
well
and
having
mounted
my
horse
i
stationed
myself
near
zora
cart
which
was
in
front
after
we
had
reached
the
stage
and
were
resting
ourselves
for
the
day
a
horseman
came
from
the
aumil
with
a
letter
at
which
we
were
all
greatly
amused
it
related
how
the
head
had
been
found
and
recognized
but
at
the
same
time
implored
me
to
keep
the
event
secret
in
order
that
the
aumil
friend
the
ruler
of
nirmul
might
gain
time
to
meet
the
demand
caused
by
the
defalcation
of
the
man
we
had
killed
this
exactly
suited
my
purpose
as
i
had
now
no
doubt
that
i
should
be
able
to
get
the
amount
of
the
bills
on
the
fifth
morning
after
this
we
were
to
reach
hyderabad
it
was
estimated
as
seven
coss
distant
so
we
did
not
start
so
soon
as
usual
we
wished
to
reach
it
when
the
day
was
well
advanced
in
order
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
for
our
numbers
were
considerable
we
therefore
divided
into
three
parties
one
under
my
father
one
under
myself
and
the
other
under
surfuraz
khan
a
friend
of
my
father
whom
we
had
met
on
the
road
and
who
with
his
men
had
been
admitted
into
our
company
and
we
agreed
to
meet
again
in
the
karwan
which
was
the
usual
resort
of
all
travellers
and
where
we
were
told
we
should
find
accommodation
in
the
serais
which
were
used
by
them
mine
was
the
first
division
to
move
and
my
father
said
he
should
remain
with
the
baggage
and
bring
it
leisurely
along
as
he
should
have
to
pay
the
usual
duties
upon
the
property
we
had
secured
at
the
various
accordingly
at
full
daylight
we
set
out
it
was
a
lovely
morning
cold
yet
not
so
cold
as
in
our
own
country
where
the
frost
is
often
seen
on
the
ground
and
the
grass
feels
crisp
under
the
foot
of
the
traveller
until
the
sun
rises
still
a
good
shawl
was
a
welcome
addition
to
my
usual
clothing
wreaths
of
mist
spread
themselves
over
some
hills
to
the
left
of
the
road
and
concealed
from
our
view
an
immense
tank
which
lay
at
their
foot
while
as
a
gentle
breeze
arose
the
mists
were
set
in
motion
revealing
one
by
one
piles
of
the
most
stupendous
rocks
i
had
ever
seen
and
which
appeared
as
though
they
had
been
heaped
on
each
other
by
human
agency
i
had
been
struck
by
these
extraordinary
rocks
on
our
first
entering
telingana
and
remarked
them
now
to
bhudrinath
he
gave
a
ready
solution
to
my
conjectures
as
to
their
origin
you
perhaps
have
heard
of
one
of
our
sacred
books
called
the
mahabharut
said
he
in
it
are
related
the
wars
of
the
gods
the
origin
of
one
of
them
was
the
forcible
carrying
off
of
sita
the
wife
of
ram
she
was
taken
to
the
island
of
lanka
ceylon
and
there
detained
by
the
rakshas
or
evil
spirits
of
the
place
assisted
by
the
king
with
powerful
armies
they
defied
ram
and
he
was
in
utter
despair
at
the
loss
of
his
beautiful
wife
nor
could
he
find
any
trace
of
whither
she
had
been
carried
you
know
that
hunooman
our
was
a
wise
and
astonishing
being
in
the
monkeys
of
the
present
day
his
form
only
is
perpetuated
the
intelligence
is
gone
and
cunning
alone
is
left
to
them
but
it
is
also
a
sad
fact
that
like
them
mankind
has
also
degenerated
and
we
are
no
more
like
the
beings
of
those
days
than
the
present
monkeys
are
like
hunooman
well
as
i
was
saying
ram
in
his
perplexity
was
visited
by
hunooman
who
pitying
his
state
proposed
to
go
in
search
of
the
lost
fair
one
and
accordingly
departed
long
did
he
wander
and
at
last
discovered
her
in
lanka
in
a
state
of
as
great
distress
as
he
had
left
her
lord
in
quickly
he
returned
with
the
intelligence
and
an
army
was
assembled
for
the
conquest
of
the
island
but
a
difficulty
arose
when
it
reached
the
end
of
the
land
before
them
certainly
lay
lanka
but
a
wide
and
rough
sea
ran
between
them
the
roaring
waves
of
which
appalled
the
stoutest
hearts
nor
did
even
the
glorious
ram
himself
escape
the
general
fear
boats
were
not
to
be
procured
and
if
they
had
what
would
have
been
their
use
to
transport
an
army
which
consisted
of
millions
of
beings
each
of
whom
was
ten
cubits
in
height
ram
gave
himself
up
to
despair
but
hunooman
at
one
bound
clearing
the
channel
quickly
returned
with
assurances
that
a
bridge
could
soon
be
constructed
and
that
he
and
his
companions
would
labour
night
and
day
till
it
was
completed
quick
as
thought
legions
of
monkeys
departed
to
the
himalayas
huge
mountains
and
rocks
were
torn
from
their
foundations
and
transported
by
relays
of
these
indefatigable
beings
to
the
shores
of
the
ocean
one
by
one
they
were
dropped
into
it
from
above
and
the
splashing
of
these
huge
masses
is
described
as
terrific
the
water
ascending
to
the
heavens
and
extinguishing
the
stars
at
last
the
bridge
was
completed
the
vast
armies
marched
over
it
the
country
was
conquered
and
the
beauteous
sita
restored
to
the
arms
of
her
devoted
lord
now
these
rocks
are
part
of
those
brought
from
the
himalayas
and
have
remained
piled
upon
each
other
just
as
they
were
set
down
by
the
monkeys
for
this
country
being
it
was
here
that
the
relay
was
established
and
when
the
bridge
was
completed
these
remained
not
being
required
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
i
have
said
and
may
bhugwan
grant
that
no
one
doubt
it
i
must
tell
you
that
remains
of
the
bridge
are
visible
to
this
day
many
pilgrims
with
whom
i
have
conversed
who
had
been
to
ramisseram
declared
that
they
had
gone
in
boats
along
the
side
of
the
bridge
and
traced
it
by
the
points
of
rocks
appearing
above
the
water
almost
in
a
direct
line
from
one
land
to
the
other
with
here
and
there
a
small
island
where
the
waves
have
not
been
able
to
make
an
impression
that
further
heaps
of
rocks
similar
to
these
are
met
with
in
various
parts
between
here
and
ramisseram
which
no
doubt
were
not
required
and
you
will
remark
that
in
no
other
part
of
the
country
north
of
this
do
any
similar
ones
appear
there
can
not
therefore
be
a
stronger
proof
of
the
truth
of
our
ancient
religion
than
these
hardened
witnesses
which
will
last
to
the
end
of
the
world
to
the
confusion
of
all
unbelievers
and
sceptics
mashalla
said
i
it
is
a
wonderful
story
and
true
enough
for
i
have
heard
of
the
bridge
myself
we
moslims
have
it
that
baba
adam
who
was
placed
by
alla
in
the
paradise
of
serendeeb
which
is
lanka
got
tired
one
day
of
his
confinement
to
so
small
an
island
and
seeing
the
at
a
distance
made
the
bridge
by
throwing
mountains
into
the
sea
each
at
seven
coss
distance
to
get
there
when
it
was
completed
he
easily
stepped
from
one
to
the
other
and
so
gained
the
land
but
this
action
displeased
alla
who
soon
afterwards
ejected
him
from
the
paradise
and
man
has
been
a
wanderer
ever
since
yes
said
bhudrinath
but
is
not
my
story
the
most
probable
especially
when
you
see
all
these
rocks
piled
up
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
as
if
in
loads
why
if
a
man
wanted
to
carry
a
heap
of
stones
he
would
pile
them
up
in
the
same
way
and
see
these
are
in
separate
heaps
just
as
they
were
laid
down
some
large
some
small
according
no
doubt
to
the
strength
of
the
parties
who
bore
them
alla
ke
qoodrut
exclaimed
i
it
is
the
power
of
god
mashalla
they
were
great
monkeys
it
is
well
we
have
none
of
them
nowadays
or
they
would
pelt
us
out
of
the
land
chapter
xiv
we
passed
the
village
of
ulwal
its
white
pagoda
peeping
from
among
groves
of
tamarind
and
mango
trees
and
its
large
tank
now
glistening
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
pursuing
our
way
we
saw
on
passing
a
ridge
of
rocks
the
camp
of
the
army
at
the
hoossain
sagor
or
as
it
is
more
often
called
secunderabad
the
tents
of
the
english
force
glittered
in
the
bright
sun
and
behind
them
lay
a
vast
sheet
of
blue
water
we
had
heard
much
of
this
lake
from
many
persons
on
our
journey
and
as
we
passed
it
a
strong
breeze
had
arisen
and
the
surface
was
curled
into
a
thousand
waves
whose
white
crests
as
they
broke
sparkled
like
diamonds
and
threw
their
spray
into
our
faces
as
they
dashed
against
the
stonework
of
the
embankment
we
stood
a
long
time
gazing
upon
the
beautiful
prospect
so
new
to
us
all
and
wondering
whether
the
sea
of
which
we
had
heard
so
much
could
be
anything
like
what
was
before
us
i
have
since
then
sahib
twice
seen
the
sea
i
need
not
attempt
to
describe
it
for
you
have
sailed
over
it
but
when
i
saw
it
first
methought
i
could
have
fallen
down
and
worshiped
it
it
appeared
so
illimitable
its
edge
touching
as
it
were
the
heavens
and
spread
out
into
an
expanse
which
the
utmost
stretch
of
my
imagination
could
not
compass
a
fit
type
i
thought
of
the
god
of
all
people
whom
every
one
thinks
on
while
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
waves
as
they
rolled
on
mountain
after
mountain
and
broke
in
angry
fury
against
the
shore
seemed
to
be
a
voice
of
omnipotence
which
could
not
fail
to
awaken
emotions
of
awe
and
dread
in
the
most
callous
and
unobservant
we
passed
the
embankment
of
the
tank
as
yet
we
had
seen
nothing
of
the
city
but
there
was
a
ridge
not
far
off
and
as
we
ascended
it
i
could
no
longer
control
my
impatience
i
spurred
my
horse
and
before
i
reached
the
top
shut
my
eyes
that
whatever
was
before
me
might
burst
upon
my
view
at
once
my
horse
slackened
his
pace
when
he
reached
the
top
and
allowing
him
to
go
on
a
few
steps
i
opened
my
eyes
and
glorious
indeed
was
the
prospect
before
me
beneath
lay
hyderabad
the
object
of
many
a
conjecture
of
many
an
ardent
desire
to
reach
it
the
first
city
of
the
dukhun
justly
celebrated
throughout
the
countries
i
had
passed
i
had
imagined
it
like
every
other
i
had
seen
to
be
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
and
that
all
that
would
be
visible
of
it
would
be
here
and
there
a
minaret
rising
out
of
large
groves
of
trees
but
hyderabad
presented
a
different
aspect
i
stood
on
the
crest
of
a
gentle
slope
which
to
my
right
hand
was
broken
at
some
distance
by
rude
rocky
hills
and
to
the
left
appeared
gradually
to
descend
into
a
plain
which
stretched
away
almost
uninterruptedly
to
the
horizon
before
me
on
the
gentle
rise
of
the
valley
and
beyond
where
i
supposed
the
river
to
be
lay
the
city
its
white
terraced
houses
gleaming
brightly
in
the
sunlight
from
amidst
what
seemed
to
me
at
the
distance
almost
a
forest
of
trees
the
char
minar
and
mecca
musjid
rose
proudly
from
the
masses
of
buildings
by
which
they
were
surrounded
and
here
and
there
a
white
dome
with
its
bright
gilt
spire
marked
the
tomb
of
some
favourite
or
holy
saint
while
smaller
mosques
i
might
say
in
hundreds
were
known
by
their
slender
white
minarets
beyond
the
city
rose
another
connected
chain
of
rocky
hills
which
ran
along
until
they
met
those
on
the
right
hand
and
shut
in
the
valley
on
that
side
the
city
seemed
to
be
of
immense
extent
but
i
thought
from
the
number
of
trees
that
it
was
composed
principally
of
gardens
and
inclosures
and
was
much
surprised
afterwards
when
i
entered
it
to
find
its
streets
so
filled
with
houses
and
the
whole
so
thickly
peopled
it
was
altogether
a
most
lovely
scene
the
freshness
of
the
morning
the
pureness
of
the
air
and
the
glittering
effect
of
the
city
and
its
buildings
caused
an
impression
which
can
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
i
have
seen
it
since
and
though
it
is
ever
truly
beautiful
it
never
struck
me
as
it
did
that
day
but
i
was
then
young
full
of
spirits
and
flushed
with
the
consciousness
of
my
own
powers
just
developing
and
assuring
me
that
they
would
lead
me
to
eminence
one
by
one
as
the
thugs
came
up
each
ejaculated
his
praise
of
the
beautiful
scene
and
all
declared
that
the
capital
was
worthy
of
the
encomiums
they
had
heard
lavished
on
it
inquiring
the
nearest
road
to
the
karwan
we
descended
the
slope
and
threading
our
way
through
numberless
suburbs
we
reached
the
place
and
were
at
the
end
of
our
journey
we
were
grateful
for
it
and
for
the
protection
and
success
we
had
met
with
we
took
up
our
abode
for
the
present
in
a
serai
which
surrounded
a
large
and
richly
ornamented
mosque
and
for
our
greater
convenience
i
went
in
search
of
an
untenanted
house
and
after
some
difficulty
succeeded
in
hiring
a
small
place
the
property
of
a
merchant
who
resided
next
door
it
contained
only
three
rooms
and
the
verandah
which
was
the
shop
but
it
was
enough
for
my
father
and
myself
and
there
was
a
small
room
with
a
strong
door
in
which
we
stowed
away
all
our
plunder
zora
was
overjoyed
at
reaching
the
place
of
her
birth
and
what
was
in
reality
her
home
and
could
talk
of
nothing
but
the
delight
of
meeting
with
her
relatives
and
friends
and
the
surprise
her
arrival
would
excite
in
them
all
as
she
said
they
had
considered
her
lost
to
them
ever
since
the
nuwab
had
carried
her
off
the
almost
certainty
of
her
being
separated
from
me
as
soon
as
she
was
again
in
their
power
never
occurred
to
her
and
i
determined
that
before
she
visited
them
i
would
lay
all
my
fears
before
her
convinced
that
her
affection
for
me
would
be
the
best
guide
for
her
conduct
our
landlord
the
merchant
was
very
civil
and
attentive
to
our
wants
though
his
civility
evidently
proceeded
in
a
great
measure
from
curiosity
as
to
who
we
were
and
what
was
our
object
i
stated
to
him
in
a
few
words
our
old
story
of
my
father
being
a
merchant
and
myself
a
soldier
of
fortune
who
had
accompanied
him
in
search
of
employment
he
was
now
curious
to
know
of
what
my
father
stock
in
trade
consisted
but
we
were
resolutely
silent
upon
the
subject
although
he
offered
his
agency
to
dispose
of
our
goods
for
said
my
father
to
me
afterwards
our
goods
i
know
are
valuable
and
i
know
not
their
worth
nor
have
we
as
yet
opened
the
bales
we
will
do
so
morning
and
assort
them
we
will
then
go
into
the
city
to
the
shops
of
the
sahoukars
and
inquire
for
articles
similar
to
them
find
out
their
prices
and
by
this
means
be
enabled
to
value
our
own
were
we
to
offer
them
in
ignorance
of
their
market
prices
we
might
be
suspected
and
though
we
may
not
get
what
they
are
intrinsically
worth
we
shall
no
doubt
be
able
to
sell
the
whole
for
a
handsome
sum
i
agreed
with
him
perfectly
and
the
next
morning
we
set
to
work
to
open
the
bales
their
contents
were
indeed
costly
brocades
cloth
of
gold
fine
muslin
scarfs
also
woven
with
gold
and
silver
patterns
plain
muslins
and
a
few
shawls
besides
fine
cloths
of
different
kinds
for
and
sarees
with
silk
and
tissue
borders
the
latter
from
the
looms
of
nagpoor
these
and
the
jewels
in
our
possession
when
laid
out
and
assorted
made
a
display
on
which
we
feasted
our
eyes
for
some
time
wondering
at
their
magnificence
and
after
i
had
made
an
inventory
of
the
whole
my
father
and
myself
attired
in
handsome
clothes
and
mounted
on
the
best
of
our
horses
attended
by
a
few
of
the
men
took
our
way
into
the
city
crossing
over
an
old
but
massive
bridge
below
which
ran
the
river
now
a
shallow
stream
we
entered
by
the
gate
at
the
head
of
it
and
inquiring
our
way
went
direct
to
the
chowke
or
where
we
trusted
we
should
find
goods
exposed
for
sale
similar
to
our
own
the
streets
were
narrow
and
dirty
and
the
interior
of
the
city
certainly
did
not
answer
the
expectations
we
had
formed
from
its
outside
and
distant
appearance
still
there
were
evident
tokens
of
its
wealth
in
the
numbers
of
elephants
on
the
backs
of
which
in
canopied
umbaras
sat
noblemen
or
gentlemen
attended
by
their
armed
retainers
crowds
of
persons
paraded
the
streets
and
as
the
festival
of
the
mohorum
had
just
commenced
cries
of
hassan
hoosein
doola
deen
deen
and
a
thousand
others
familiar
to
us
resounded
on
every
side
we
made
our
way
as
well
as
we
could
through
the
throng
and
our
attendants
were
often
obliged
to
clear
us
a
passage
which
exposed
them
to
the
jeers
and
abuse
of
the
multitude
as
they
were
recognized
as
strangers
from
their
dress
and
language
once
or
twice
i
observed
a
hand
laid
on
a
sword
by
some
respectable
person
who
had
been
jostled
or
pushed
by
our
men
and
heard
a
deep
threat
muttered
but
we
managed
to
get
along
and
at
length
came
to
a
broader
street
where
the
crowd
was
less
dense
and
here
that
noble
building
the
char
minar
burst
at
once
upon
our
view
how
grand
i
exclaimed
stopping
my
horse
and
looking
up
to
the
huge
minarets
which
seemed
to
pierce
the
clouds
to
see
this
alone
is
worth
a
journey
from
delhi
the
minarets
formed
the
four
corners
of
the
building
and
from
them
sprang
immense
arches
which
supported
a
roof
upon
the
top
of
which
a
small
mosque
was
built
it
did
not
look
capable
of
supporting
the
immense
weight
of
the
whole
and
yet
it
had
stood
for
centuries
and
the
fabric
was
unimpaired
it
is
the
hour
of
prayer
said
my
father
interrupting
my
gaze
and
hark
the
muezzin
calls
from
the
mecca
mosque
thither
we
will
now
proceed
and
afterwards
transact
our
business
i
followed
him
and
passing
by
the
char
minar
we
turned
up
a
street
to
our
right
and
stopped
our
horses
at
the
gate
of
the
mosque
a
feeling
of
awe
mingled
with
admiration
came
over
me
as
we
entered
the
and
advanced
along
a
raised
causeway
to
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
steps
which
led
up
to
the
interior
on
either
side
of
us
were
the
graves
of
princes
and
nobles
many
of
them
of
elegant
forms
and
richly
carved
but
the
building
itself
engrossed
my
entire
admiration
five
lofty
and
wide
arches
opened
to
view
the
interior
of
the
edifice
where
an
equal
number
appeared
in
depth
and
where
the
arches
met
the
eye
was
perplexed
by
the
innumerable
points
and
ornaments
which
running
into
each
other
completed
a
roof
of
exquisite
design
and
workmanship
to
add
to
its
beauty
the
whole
was
of
stone
carefully
smoothed
whereas
the
char
minar
and
the
other
buildings
i
had
as
yet
seen
were
of
stucco
but
i
had
little
time
to
observe
more
the
sonorous
and
melancholy
call
of
the
muezzin
had
ended
and
the
few
attendants
for
the
afternoon
prayer
had
spread
their
carpets
and
commenced
their
devotions
we
joined
them
and
kneeling
on
our
outspread
waistbands
went
through
the
usual
forms
while
the
low
murmur
of
the
prayers
of
all
ascended
to
the
fretted
roof
and
added
to
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
to
the
majority
of
those
present
there
was
perhaps
nothing
new
or
uncommon
but
i
who
had
escaped
the
dangers
of
our
journey
and
those
attendant
on
our
profession
felt
that
it
went
to
my
heart
and
murderer
as
i
was
though
not
as
yet
callous
i
was
softened
and
my
tears
flowed
fast
as
i
repeated
the
words
of
prayer
and
the
impressive
language
of
the
blessed
koran
in
which
they
were
couched
the
ceremony
concluded
we
rose
and
though
i
was
well
disposed
to
linger
in
the
sacred
edifice
and
observe
more
of
its
beauties
my
father
hurried
me
away
and
we
returned
to
the
char
minar
here
said
my
father
those
useful
rogues
the
dullals
are
to
be
met
with
they
will
try
to
cheat
us
no
doubt
as
it
is
their
trade
but
as
we
are
not
purchasers
we
may
avail
ourselves
of
their
aid
to
find
out
the
houses
of
the
merchants
who
deal
in
our
articles
and
it
may
be
that
the
fellow
we
fix
on
will
be
intelligent
and
assist
us
to
dispose
of
our
property
we
stopped
on
reaching
the
building
the
lower
part
of
which
was
sadly
disfigured
by
numbers
of
wretched
huts
and
stalls
where
venders
of
vegetables
and
sweetmeats
sat
and
served
out
their
goods
to
the
my
father
calling
to
a
young
hindoo
of
intelligent
countenance
asked
him
where
he
could
meet
with
a
dullal
as
he
was
a
stranger
in
the
city
and
wished
to
see
some
clothes
and
other
goods
which
he
did
not
know
where
to
find
i
am
one
at
your
service
noble
sir
he
replied
and
i
know
well
the
richest
warehouses
and
can
lead
you
to
any
you
wish
and
added
he
there
is
not
a
sahoukar
or
dealer
in
the
city
who
will
not
readily
give
your
poor
servant
moheno
das
a
character
for
sobriety
and
trustworthiness
you
had
better
not
say
much
of
your
good
qualities
till
they
have
been
proved
said
my
father
your
tribe
has
not
the
best
reputation
on
these
points
ah
said
the
man
my
lord
is
well
aware
of
what
alas
that
i
should
say
it
the
majority
of
our
tribe
are
a
sad
set
nevertheless
his
slave
will
not
be
found
to
be
like
them
for
having
begun
by
being
honest
he
has
not
found
it
worth
his
while
to
be
otherwise
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
you
would
be
dishonest
if
it
suited
your
interests
said
i
but
come
the
day
wears
fast
and
we
are
anxious
to
be
out
of
this
crowd
before
dark
the
fellow
gave
me
a
knowing
look
accompanied
by
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
which
could
not
be
mistaken
what
i
had
said
had
proved
to
him
that
we
were
on
our
guard
what
description
of
goods
may
you
be
in
search
of
said
he
any
may
be
procured
from
the
shawls
of
cashmere
and
brocades
of
benares
to
the
meanest
article
benares
fabrics
are
what
we
require
said
i
a
few
handsome
roomals
and
doputtas
and
a
turban
or
two
to
adorn
ourselves
for
the
minister
durbar
you
shall
see
them
said
the
dullal
girding
his
shawl
about
his
waist
now
follow
me
and
keep
a
good
eye
on
me
lest
you
lose
me
in
the
crowd
and
so
saying
he
descended
the
steps
of
the
building
and
led
us
along
some
of
the
principal
streets
till
we
dived
into
an
obscure
alley
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
house
which
certainly
promised
nothing
from
its
exterior
a
very
unsatisfactory
search
we
should
have
had
said
i
to
my
father
had
we
endeavoured
to
find
out
a
merchant
ourselves
it
is
well
we
took
this
fellow
with
us
these
merchants
i
have
heard
usually
choose
these
secluded
places
on
account
of
their
security
replied
my
father
it
would
not
do
in
a
lawless
place
like
this
to
expose
goods
for
sale
as
they
do
in
other
cities
but
they
are
well
known
and
easily
found
out
by
strangers
if
they
apply
to
the
dullals
as
we
have
done
we
were
ushered
into
the
interior
of
the
house
and
were
received
by
a
large
fat
man
the
very
counterpart
of
the
sahoukar
i
had
killed
i
started
involuntarily
at
the
resemblance
but
soon
recovering
myself
and
assured
by
his
civility
i
seated
myself
as
did
also
my
father
and
we
quickly
entered
on
the
object
of
our
visit
one
by
one
bales
were
opened
and
their
contents
spread
before
us
the
sahoukar
stock
seemed
to
be
interminable
and
of
great
value
we
selected
several
articles
and
inquiring
the
prices
of
those
which
we
inspected
of
which
i
made
memorandums
we
desired
them
to
be
kept
for
us
saying
that
we
would
call
the
next
day
with
money
to
pay
for
them
the
sahoukar
pressed
us
to
take
them
with
us
and
the
dullal
offered
his
security
for
us
but
for
obvious
reasons
we
declined
and
took
our
leave
of
the
merchant
the
dullal
accompanied
us
as
far
as
the
char
minar
where
my
father
slipping
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hands
for
his
trouble
told
him
we
now
knew
our
way
home
and
bid
him
come
early
in
the
morning
to
the
karwan
and
inquire
for
the
house
of
rugonath
das
sahoukar
where
he
would
get
tidings
of
us
so
far
i
am
satisfied
said
my
father
our
goods
as
you
will
have
observed
are
equal
in
quality
to
those
we
saw
and
by
the
prices
affixed
to
them
we
have
a
good
earnest
of
a
large
sum
of
money
if
we
can
only
dispose
of
them
a
matter
i
apprehend
of
no
difficulty
if
properly
managed
the
next
morning
came
the
dullal
canst
thou
be
secret
asked
my
father
at
once
and
throwing
him
a
couple
of
rupees
the
fellow
started
and
trembled
if
such
is
my
lord
will
said
he
his
teeth
almost
chattering
with
fear
i
can
but
i
am
a
poor
man
a
very
inoffensive
man
i
am
my
lord
slave
and
rub
my
nose
on
his
feet
cried
he
at
last
fairly
throwing
himself
on
the
ground
and
rubbing
his
forehead
against
the
ground
as
he
saw
my
father
brow
contracting
and
his
face
assuming
an
expression
of
anger
at
the
evident
suspicion
which
the
man
had
of
us
why
cried
my
father
as
the
fellow
lay
on
the
floor
whimpering
what
is
this
what
son
of
a
vile
woman
art
thou
in
the
name
of
alla
get
up
because
a
man
who
inshalla
is
somebody
asks
thee
whether
thou
canst
be
secret
must
thou
of
necessity
think
thou
art
going
to
have
thy
throat
cut
do
not
talk
of
it
cried
the
wretch
shutting
his
eyes
and
shuddering
i
am
a
poor
man
and
a
miserable
hindoo
what
would
my
lord
get
by
cutting
my
throat
nay
said
my
father
this
is
beyond
bearing
the
fellow
has
not
the
soul
of
a
flea
kick
him
out
into
the
street
and
beat
him
on
the
mouth
with
a
slipper
there
are
plenty
of
dullals
to
be
found
beside
him
pardon
noble
sir
cried
the
fellow
the
mention
of
his
trade
leading
him
to
suppose
that
he
was
required
in
the
way
of
his
calling
pardon
my
foolishness
my
lord
threatening
aspect
turned
my
liver
into
water
but
now
that
he
smiles
again
i
am
assured
that
no
harm
is
meant
harm
surely
not
to
such
a
wretch
as
thou
said
my
father
but
since
thou
art
inclined
to
listen
to
reason
sit
down
and
hear
what
we
have
to
say
to
thee
i
can
be
secret
cried
the
dullal
let
my
lord
speak
it
will
fare
badly
with
thee
if
thou
art
not
said
my
father
again
looking
grimly
at
him
but
listen
i
am
a
merchant
i
have
never
been
at
this
city
before
but
hearing
at
delhi
that
an
investment
of
valuable
goods
such
as
we
saw
yesterday
was
likely
to
sell
well
here
i
have
brought
one
down
with
me
i
knew
not
the
selling
prices
here
and
therefore
engaged
thee
to
show
me
some
goods
that
i
might
be
able
to
regulate
the
sale
of
my
own
now
canst
thou
manage
it
for
me
surely
surely
said
the
fellow
in
delight
nothing
is
more
easy
my
lord
will
not
of
course
forget
my
perquisites
on
the
sale
thou
shalt
have
five
rupees
in
every
hundred
worth
disposed
of
said
my
father
will
this
content
thee
it
is
a
princely
offer
and
worthy
of
my
lord
generosity
said
the
dullal
might
i
be
permitted
to
see
the
goods
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
see
them
and
here
they
are
rejoined
my
father
and
he
opened
the
door
of
the
room
where
they
were
and
one
by
one
displayed
the
contents
of
the
bales
this
is
indeed
a
rich
stock
said
the
dullal
you
may
be
able
to
sell
most
of
the
cloths
but
i
question
whether
the
whole
without
you
intend
to
remain
here
some
time
that
depends
upon
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
said
my
father
if
i
can
not
sell
them
all
here
i
shall
take
what
remains
to
poona
well
said
the
man
if
i
am
permitted
i
will
make
memorandums
of
all
that
there
is
here
and
in
the
course
of
will
let
you
know
what
can
be
done
i
can
not
do
so
earlier
for
i
shall
have
to
visit
all
the
dealers
do
what
you
think
best
said
my
father
and
here
are
ten
rupees
for
your
expenses
now
begone
and
let
me
see
you
again
at
this
time
the
fellow
made
many
salams
and
took
his
leave
did
you
ever
see
so
pitiful
a
wretch
said
my
father
for
two
cowrees
i
would
have
strangled
him
on
the
spot
to
put
an
end
to
so
disgraceful
a
coward
let
him
pass
said
i
he
is
but
a
hindoo
and
not
worth
thinking
of
but
you
are
not
going
to
let
him
off
with
all
the
money
you
have
promised
him
of
course
not
replied
my
father
you
understand
i
suppose
what
is
to
be
done
perfectly
said
i
leave
him
to
me
i
went
to
zora
my
own
gentle
zora
she
had
been
speaking
much
of
visiting
her
kindred
and
though
i
had
put
her
off
as
well
as
i
could
since
we
arrived
i
saw
with
concern
that
i
had
no
longer
any
pretext
for
detaining
her
i
could
have
fled
with
her
i
think
i
could
such
was
the
intensity
of
my
love
for
her
that
had
i
had
the
courage
to
speak
of
flight
and
she
had
agreed
to
accompany
me
i
verily
believe
i
should
have
forsaken
father
associates
and
profession
and
committed
myself
to
the
world
and
if
i
had
said
the
thug
musing
should
i
have
been
worse
off
than
i
am
now
should
i
ever
have
worn
these
disgraceful
fetters
have
ever
doomed
myself
to
perpetual
imprisonment
and
a
state
of
existence
which
i
would
to
heaven
were
ended
and
should
be
ended
but
that
i
have
and
i
curse
myself
for
it
a
mean
base
aye
cowardly
lingering
for
life
sahib
i
tell
you
it
would
have
been
well
for
me
had
i
then
fled
fled
from
guilt
and
crime
into
which
i
daily
plunged
deeper
with
my
soldierlike
figure
my
address
my
skill
in
the
use
of
arms
i
might
have
gained
honourable
service
i
might
have
led
armies
or
have
met
a
soldier
death
on
some
but
it
was
not
so
written
it
was
not
my
fate
and
i
am
what
i
am
a
curse
to
myself
and
to
all
with
whom
i
have
ever
been
connected
zora
she
thought
not
of
my
anxiety
all
she
hoped
for
cared
for
now
was
to
see
her
mother
and
her
sister
she
assailed
me
with
importunities
that
i
would
send
her
and
assured
me
that
she
would
not
be
long
absent
but
go
to
them
she
must
they
would
so
rejoice
to
see
her
again
and
would
welcome
me
as
her
deliverer
after
seeing
them
she
would
return
to
me
and
we
should
never
again
be
parted
alas
i
said
my
zora
you
know
not
what
you
ask
do
you
think
that
those
charms
are
of
no
value
to
your
mother
and
sister
you
have
owned
to
me
that
you
are
far
more
beautiful
and
attractive
than
any
of
those
you
are
connected
with
in
your
absence
they
will
have
sunk
into
obscurity
and
they
will
hail
your
return
as
the
earnest
of
more
wealth
and
more
distinction
nay
these
are
cruel
words
my
beloved
she
replied
you
well
know
that
i
have
never
deceived
you
and
that
as
true
as
that
i
breathe
my
soul
is
yours
for
ever
so
let
me
go
i
pray
you
and
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
be
again
with
you
and
pressed
to
your
honoured
breast
be
it
so
said
i
sadly
for
though
i
hardly
dared
think
it
i
felt
as
if
this
was
our
parting
for
ever
go
then
and
if
you
return
not
i
will
come
to
you
by
the
evening
a
covered
zenana
cart
was
easily
hired
and
the
driver
seeming
perfectly
to
understand
where
she
wished
to
go
she
stepped
joyfully
into
it
attended
by
her
old
servant
and
with
two
of
my
men
to
attend
her
she
left
me
they
soon
returned
but
they
knew
nothing
save
that
there
was
great
joy
in
the
house
when
her
relatives
saw
her
towards
evening
i
could
no
longer
control
my
impatience
and
taking
one
of
them
with
me
i
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
to
her
house
it
was
situated
nearly
opposite
a
fountain
which
is
in
the
centre
of
the
street
below
the
char
minar
and
i
had
passed
it
the
day
before
i
was
easily
admitted
and
oh
what
joy
was
evinced
when
i
entered
the
room
where
zora
her
sister
and
mother
were
seated
he
is
come
cried
my
poor
girl
and
she
rushed
into
my
arms
she
strained
me
to
her
breast
for
an
instant
and
then
holding
me
from
her
look
mother
she
cried
look
on
him
is
he
not
as
i
said
is
he
not
as
beautiful
and
brave
the
old
lady
approached
me
and
passing
her
hands
over
my
face
cracked
her
knuckles
and
every
joint
of
her
fingers
by
pressing
the
backs
of
her
hands
against
her
temples
while
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
this
she
did
as
often
as
there
was
a
joint
to
crack
and
then
she
caught
me
in
her
arms
and
hugged
me
crying
at
the
same
time
like
a
child
the
sister
received
me
i
thought
rather
coldly
had
i
been
less
handsome
perhaps
she
would
have
been
more
cordial
she
did
not
seem
to
like
zora
having
so
handsome
a
lover
may
the
blessing
of
the
prophet
and
the
twelve
imams
be
on
you
and
your
posterity
cried
the
old
lady
when
she
had
recovered
breath
to
speak
may
the
gracious
alla
keep
you
in
his
protection
and
may
the
lady
muriam
and
the
holy
bless
you
you
have
made
a
desolate
house
full
again
and
have
changed
our
weeping
to
joy
what
can
i
say
more
who
could
have
thought
it
was
our
zora
when
a
cart
stopped
at
the
door
zenatbee
was
just
saying
that
it
was
that
vile
wretch
sukeena
come
to
pretend
condolence
while
in
reality
she
rejoiced
at
our
misfortune
which
left
her
without
a
rival
and
i
was
saying
no
matter
what
i
was
saying
when
we
heard
a
faint
cry
as
if
of
astonishment
and
a
bustle
and
we
did
not
know
what
to
think
when
in
rushed
our
lost
zora
our
pearl
our
diamond
and
then
i
thought
my
old
heart
would
break
with
joy
for
my
liver
seemed
to
be
melted
and
i
have
done
nothing
since
meer
sahib
but
sit
opposite
to
her
and
stroke
her
face
with
my
hands
and
gaze
into
her
eyes
to
assure
myself
that
i
am
not
mistaken
inshalla
i
will
send
five
rupees
to
every
shrine
in
the
city
and
distribute
sweetmeats
to
fifty
beggars
in
the
name
of
the
imam
zamin
besides
i
will
have
a
tazea
made
and
will
no
longer
wear
these
mourning
garments
ah
meer
sahib
if
you
knew
how
i
have
sat
day
after
day
and
wept
till
i
am
reduced
to
a
mere
shadow
of
what
i
was
and
all
my
friends
tried
to
console
me
but
in
vain
i
would
not
be
comforted
and
her
tears
flowed
afresh
at
the
recollection
what
the
old
lady
was
before
her
grief
commenced
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
but
in
her
present
plight
she
appeared
the
fattest
woman
i
had
ever
looked
upon
we
sat
conversing
and
relating
our
adventures
until
the
evening
fell
and
i
spread
my
carpet
for
prayer
ah
he
is
a
good
syud
said
the
old
woman
i
like
to
see
the
young
fond
of
their
devotions
but
it
is
ever
thus
with
the
noble
race
from
hindostan
i
was
preparing
to
take
my
departure
when
they
one
and
all
cried
out
against
it
what
leave
our
house
before
you
have
broken
bread
and
drunk
water
with
us
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
i
must
stay
dinner
was
prepared
they
were
just
on
the
point
of
sending
for
me
when
i
came
and
above
all
it
was
the
ninth
day
of
the
mohorum
and
i
must
stay
were
it
but
to
see
the
procession
of
the
nal
sahib
that
sacred
relic
one
of
the
shoes
of
the
horse
the
blessed
prophet
rode
when
he
fled
to
medina
would
be
carried
in
grand
procession
and
i
should
never
have
a
chance
of
seeing
the
like
again
these
reasons
and
many
imploring
looks
from
zora
made
me
speedily
determine
so
sending
away
my
horse
and
the
man
with
a
message
to
my
father
to
say
i
should
not
return
i
gave
myself
up
to
a
night
of
enjoyment
such
as
i
little
expected
when
i
parted
with
zora
in
the
morning
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
the
old
lady
cooking
unexceptionable
there
were
all
sorts
of
curries
with
but
a
mouthful
in
each
little
cup
but
still
sufficient
of
each
to
leave
an
exquisite
flavour
in
the
mouth
only
to
be
replaced
by
another
surpassing
it
pilaus
of
various
kinds
and
sweetmeats
and
to
crown
all
some
delicious
wine
of
the
infidels
called
the
francees
which
the
old
lady
pronounced
not
to
be
wine
but
sherbet
and
allowed
to
the
huzoor
himself
the
great
sikundur
jah
it
certainly
was
very
delicious
and
elevated
the
spirits
at
the
end
after
taking
a
whiff
or
two
she
carefully
wiped
the
and
presented
me
with
her
own
hookah
the
fragrance
of
which
was
beyond
that
of
ambergris
or
musk
i
was
in
paradise
i
was
intensely
happy
you
have
heard
me
sing
said
zora
to
me
when
i
was
in
captivity
and
after
the
fatigues
of
travel
in
our
little
tent
where
there
was
no
scope
for
my
voice
now
my
heart
is
glad
and
bounding
and
you
shall
hear
me
again
may
the
prophet
pardon
me
for
singing
during
the
mohorum
and
you
shall
say
which
you
like
best
my
sister
shall
accompany
me
till
i
am
tired
and
i
will
then
accompany
her
a
saringhee
was
brought
zenat
tuned
it
and
taking
the
bow
played
a
short
prelude
it
was
one
of
the
most
entrancing
sounds
i
had
ever
heard
zora
surpassed
all
her
former
attempts
it
was
ravishing
to
listen
to
her
and
her
sister
who
was
a
perfect
mistress
of
the
instrument
a
strange
thing
for
a
woman
gave
it
its
full
force
of
melody
and
expression
you
know
sahib
how
nearly
it
accords
to
the
human
voice
and
now
as
accompaniment
and
song
rose
and
fell
together
it
appeared
as
though
two
of
the
richest
fullest
voices
were
pouring
forth
strains
such
as
angels
might
have
come
down
from
the
skies
to
hear
but
at
last
the
noise
of
drums
and
shouting
outside
became
so
great
that
both
gave
up
in
despair
a
plague
on
them
all
said
she
and
i
in
such
voice
that
i
could
have
sung
to
you
all
night
and
have
i
sung
well
ay
have
you
said
i
but
methinks
the
first
song
you
ever
sung
to
me
at
the
palace
in
oomerkhér
will
dwell
longer
on
my
memory
than
any
i
have
heard
since
ya
alla
exclaimed
zenat
who
had
moved
to
the
window
was
there
ever
a
sight
so
magnificent
come
and
see
is
passing
fast
and
will
be
soon
out
of
sight
chapter
xv
zenat
exclamation
drew
us
to
the
window
quick
she
said
look
out
or
you
will
lose
the
sight
they
are
even
now
passing
the
char
minar
we
did
look
out
and
the
sight
was
indeed
magnificent
a
crowd
of
some
hundreds
of
people
were
escorting
a
punjah
that
holy
symbol
of
our
faith
most
of
them
were
armed
and
their
naked
weapons
gleamed
brightly
in
the
light
of
numberless
torches
which
were
elevated
on
lofty
bamboos
others
bore
made
of
silver
and
gold
tinsel
with
deep
fringes
of
the
same
which
glittered
and
sparkled
as
they
were
waved
to
and
fro
by
the
movements
of
those
who
carried
them
but
the
object
the
most
striking
of
all
was
the
char
minar
itself
as
the
procession
passed
under
it
the
light
of
the
torches
illuminated
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
my
gaze
was
riveted
as
though
it
had
suddenly
and
startlingly
sprung
into
existence
the
procession
passed
on
and
all
once
more
relapsed
into
gloom
the
char
minar
was
no
longer
visible
to
the
eye
dazzled
as
it
had
been
by
the
lights
but
as
it
became
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
the
building
gradually
revealed
itself
dim
and
shadowy
its
huge
white
surface
looking
like
a
spectre
or
i
could
fancy
like
one
of
the
mysterious
inhabitants
of
the
air
whom
we
are
told
and
other
sages
had
under
their
command
and
were
thus
enabled
to
describe
again
as
we
gazed
another
procession
would
pass
and
a
sudden
flash
as
of
lightning
would
cause
the
same
effect
interior
and
exterior
of
the
edifice
were
as
bright
far
brighter
they
seemed
than
at
noonday
i
was
enraptured
zenat
had
left
us
to
ourselves
and
we
sat
my
arm
around
my
beloved
while
she
nestled
close
to
me
and
we
murmured
to
each
other
those
vows
of
love
which
hearts
like
ours
could
alone
frame
and
give
utterance
to
long
did
we
sit
thus
sahib
i
know
not
how
long
the
hours
fled
like
moments
look
cried
zora
look
at
that
mighty
gathering
in
the
street
below
us
they
are
now
lighting
the
torches
and
the
procession
of
the
nal
sahib
will
presently
come
forth
i
had
not
observed
it
though
i
had
heard
the
hum
of
voices
the
gloom
of
the
street
had
hitherto
prevented
my
distinguishing
anything
but
as
torch
after
torch
was
lighted
and
raised
aloft
on
immense
poles
the
sea
of
human
heads
revealed
itself
there
were
thousands
the
street
was
so
packed
from
side
to
side
that
to
move
was
impossible
the
mass
was
closely
wedged
together
and
we
waited
impatiently
for
the
time
when
it
should
be
put
in
motion
to
make
the
tour
of
the
city
one
by
one
the
processions
we
had
seen
pass
before
us
ranged
themselves
in
front
and
as
they
joined
together
who
can
describe
the
splendour
of
the
effect
of
the
thousands
of
torches
the
thousands
of
of
flags
and
pennons
of
all
descriptions
the
hundreds
of
elephants
gaily
caparisoned
bearing
on
their
backs
their
noble
owners
clad
in
the
richest
apparel
attended
by
their
armed
retainers
and
spearmen
some
stationary
others
moving
to
and
fro
amidst
the
vast
mass
of
human
beings
one
elephant
in
particular
i
remarked
a
noble
animal
bearing
a
large
silver
umbara
in
which
sat
four
boys
doubtless
the
sons
of
some
nobleman
from
the
number
of
attendants
which
surrounded
them
the
animal
was
evidently
much
excited
whether
by
the
noise
the
lights
and
the
crowd
or
whether
he
was
i
can
not
say
but
the
mahout
seemed
to
have
great
difficulty
in
keeping
him
quiet
and
often
dug
his
ankoos
into
the
brute
head
with
great
force
which
made
him
lift
his
trunk
into
the
air
and
bellow
with
pain
i
saw
the
mahout
was
enraged
and
from
the
gestures
of
some
of
the
persons
near
could
guess
that
they
were
advising
him
to
be
gentle
but
the
animal
became
more
restive
and
i
feared
there
would
be
some
accident
as
the
mahout
only
punished
him
the
more
severely
at
last
by
some
unlucky
chance
the
blazing
part
of
a
torch
fell
from
the
pole
upon
which
it
was
raised
on
the
elephant
back
he
screamed
out
with
the
sudden
pain
and
raising
his
trunk
rushed
into
the
crowd
ya
alla
what
a
sight
it
was
hundreds
as
they
vainly
endeavoured
to
get
out
of
the
way
only
wedged
themselves
closer
together
shrieks
and
screams
rent
the
air
but
the
most
fearful
sight
was
when
the
maddened
beast
unable
to
make
his
way
through
the
press
seized
on
an
unfortunate
wretch
by
the
waist
with
his
trunk
and
whirling
him
high
in
the
air
dashed
him
against
the
ground
and
then
kneeling
down
crushed
him
to
a
mummy
with
his
tusks
involuntarily
i
turned
away
my
head
the
sight
was
sickening
and
it
was
just
under
me
when
i
looked
again
the
brute
apparently
satisfied
was
standing
quiet
and
immediately
afterwards
was
driven
away
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
man
was
carried
off
and
deposited
in
a
neighbouring
shop
and
all
again
became
quiet
all
at
once
the
multitude
broke
out
into
deafening
shouts
of
hassan
hoosein
deen
deen
the
hoarse
roar
of
which
was
mingled
with
the
beating
of
immense
nagaras
the
sound
was
deafening
yet
most
impressive
the
multitude
became
agitated
every
face
was
at
once
turned
towards
the
portal
from
which
the
sacred
relic
was
about
to
issue
and
it
came
forth
in
another
instant
amidst
the
sudden
blaze
of
a
thousand
blue
lights
i
turned
my
eye
to
the
char
minar
if
it
had
looked
brilliant
by
the
how
much
more
so
did
it
now
the
pale
sulphureous
glare
caused
its
white
surface
to
glitter
like
silver
high
in
the
air
the
white
minarets
gleamed
with
intense
brightness
and
as
it
stood
out
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
it
seemed
to
be
a
sudden
creation
of
the
genii
so
grand
so
unearthly
while
the
numberless
torches
overpowered
by
the
superior
brightness
of
the
fireworks
gave
a
dim
and
lurid
light
through
their
smoke
which
as
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
hung
over
them
all
at
once
a
numberless
flight
of
rockets
from
the
top
of
the
char
minar
sprung
hissing
into
the
sky
and
at
an
immense
height
far
above
the
tops
of
the
minarets
burst
almost
simultaneously
and
descended
in
a
shower
of
brilliant
blue
balls
there
was
a
breathless
silence
for
a
moment
as
every
eye
was
upturned
to
watch
their
descent
for
the
effect
was
overpowering
but
again
the
shouts
arose
the
multitude
swayed
to
and
fro
like
the
waves
of
a
troubled
sea
every
one
turned
towards
the
char
minar
and
in
a
few
instants
the
living
mass
was
in
motion
it
moved
slowly
at
first
but
the
pressure
from
behind
was
so
great
that
those
in
front
were
obliged
to
run
gradually
however
the
mighty
tide
flowed
along
at
a
more
measured
pace
and
it
seemed
endless
host
after
host
poured
through
the
narrow
street
men
of
all
countries
most
of
them
bearing
naked
weapons
which
flashed
in
the
were
ranged
in
ranks
shouting
the
cries
of
the
faith
others
in
the
garbs
of
fakeers
chanted
wild
hymns
of
the
death
of
the
blessed
martyrs
others
again
in
fantastic
dresses
formed
themselves
into
groups
and
as
they
ran
rather
than
walked
along
performed
strange
and
uncouth
antics
some
were
painted
from
head
to
foot
with
different
colours
others
had
hung
bells
to
their
ancles
shoulders
and
elbows
which
jingled
as
they
walked
or
danced
here
and
there
would
be
seen
a
man
painted
like
a
tiger
a
rope
passed
round
his
waist
which
was
held
by
three
or
four
others
while
the
tiger
made
desperate
leaps
and
charges
into
the
crowd
which
were
received
with
shouts
of
merriment
some
again
were
dressed
in
sheepskins
to
imitate
bears
others
were
monkeys
with
enormous
tails
and
they
grinned
and
mowed
at
the
crowd
which
surrounded
them
now
some
nobleman
would
scatter
from
his
elephant
showers
of
pice
or
cowrees
among
the
crowd
below
him
and
it
was
fearful
though
amusing
to
watch
the
eager
scramble
and
the
desperate
exertions
of
those
undermost
to
extricate
themselves
not
unattended
by
severe
bruises
and
hurts
bodies
of
arabs
singing
their
wild
firing
their
matchlocks
in
the
air
and
flourishing
their
naked
swords
and
jumbeas
joined
the
throng
and
immediately
preceded
the
holy
relic
which
at
last
came
up
it
was
carried
on
a
cushion
of
cloth
of
gold
covered
by
a
small
canopy
of
silver
tissue
the
canopy
and
its
deep
silver
fringes
glittering
in
the
blaze
of
innumerable
torches
moolas
dressed
in
long
robes
walked
slowly
before
singing
the
moonakib
and
the
murceas
men
waved
enormous
chourees
of
the
feathers
of
peacocks
tails
incense
burned
on
the
platform
of
the
canopy
and
sent
up
its
fragrant
cloud
of
smoke
and
handfuls
of
the
sweet
ubeer
were
showered
upon
the
cushion
by
all
who
could
by
any
means
or
exertions
get
near
enough
to
reach
it
gradually
and
slowly
the
whole
passed
by
who
can
describe
its
magnificence
such
a
scene
must
be
seen
to
be
felt
i
say
sahib
for
who
could
see
a
mighty
multitude
like
that
collected
for
a
holy
purpose
with
one
heart
one
soul
without
emotion
hours
we
sat
there
gazing
on
the
spectacle
we
scarcely
spoke
so
absorbed
were
we
by
the
interest
of
the
scene
below
us
at
length
however
the
whole
had
passed
and
the
street
was
left
to
loneliness
and
darkness
the
few
forms
which
flitted
along
here
and
there
looked
more
like
the
restless
spirits
of
a
than
human
beings
and
the
silence
was
only
now
and
then
broken
by
a
solitary
fakeer
his
bells
tinkling
as
he
hurried
along
to
join
the
great
procession
the
roar
of
which
was
heard
far
and
faintly
in
the
distance
just
as
we
were
about
to
retire
a
number
of
men
formed
themselves
into
a
circle
around
a
pit
in
which
were
a
few
lighted
embers
but
some
bundles
of
grass
were
thrown
on
them
the
light
blazed
up
and
drawing
their
swords
they
danced
round
and
round
the
fire
waving
their
weapons
while
all
shouted
aloud
in
hoarse
voices
the
names
of
the
blessed
martyrs
the
blazing
fire
in
the
centre
lighted
up
their
wild
forms
and
gestures
as
they
danced
tossing
their
arms
wildly
in
the
air
now
they
stood
still
and
swayed
to
and
fro
while
the
fire
died
away
and
they
were
scarcely
perceptible
again
more
fuel
was
thrown
on
the
red
blaze
sprung
up
far
above
their
heads
and
their
wild
round
was
renewed
with
fresh
spirit
the
night
was
now
far
spent
and
the
chill
breeze
which
arose
warned
us
to
retire
indeed
zenat
and
her
mother
had
done
so
long
before
and
we
were
left
to
ourselves
sahib
that
was
the
last
night
i
passed
with
my
beloved
and
the
whole
of
our
intercourse
remains
on
my
memory
like
the
impression
of
a
pleasing
dream
on
which
i
delight
often
to
dwell
to
conjure
up
the
scenes
and
conversations
of
years
past
and
gone
years
of
wild
adventure
of
trial
of
sorrow
and
of
crime
i
can
picture
to
myself
my
zora
as
i
parted
from
her
on
the
following
morning
i
can
again
hear
her
protestations
of
unalterable
love
her
entreaties
that
i
would
soon
return
to
her
and
above
all
i
remember
her
surpassing
loveliness
and
the
look
of
anguish
i
might
call
it
with
which
she
followed
me
as
i
left
her
after
one
long
passionate
embrace
these
impressions
i
say
still
linger
on
a
mind
which
has
been
rendered
callous
by
crime
by
an
habitual
system
of
deception
and
by
my
rude
intercourse
with
the
world
my
deadliest
enemy
and
they
are
refreshing
and
soothing
because
i
have
no
wrong
toward
her
to
charge
myself
with
i
rescued
her
she
loved
me
and
i
loved
her
too
we
wanted
nought
but
a
longer
intercourse
to
have
strengthened
that
affection
which
would
have
lasted
till
death
but
why
should
i
talk
thus
why
should
i
a
convicted
felon
and
murderer
linger
on
the
description
of
such
scenes
and
thoughts
sahib
i
have
done
with
them
i
will
tell
you
of
sterner
things
of
the
further
adventures
of
my
life
i
returned
to
my
father
he
was
not
angry
at
my
absence
and
i
found
mohun
das
the
dullal
closeted
with
him
and
also
another
person
mohun
das
had
been
eminently
successful
the
sahoukar
i
saw
was
the
assistant
in
a
wealthy
house
who
had
need
of
all
our
goods
and
he
was
come
to
see
them
before
the
bargain
was
finally
closed
they
were
displayed
to
him
both
goods
and
jewels
he
approved
of
all
said
he
would
return
shortly
with
an
offer
for
them
and
having
made
a
list
of
the
whole
he
departed
now
said
mohun
das
about
the
price
what
do
you
ask
you
know
better
than
i
do
said
my
father
therefore
do
you
speak
and
remember
the
more
they
sell
for
the
more
you
get
i
have
not
forgotten
your
munificence
said
the
dullal
and
i
say
at
once
the
cloths
are
worth
sixteen
and
the
jewels
ten
thousand
rupees
but
you
must
ask
thirty
thousand
you
will
get
i
dare
say
it
is
too
little
said
my
father
they
cost
me
nearly
that
sum
and
how
am
i
to
pay
my
guards
if
i
get
no
profit
i
shall
ask
for
the
whole
well
said
the
dullal
if
you
do
so
much
the
better
for
me
but
mark
what
i
say
you
will
get
no
more
than
my
valuation
however
if
you
will
trust
me
and
leave
it
to
my
judgment
i
will
get
a
fair
price
i
will
but
recollect
thousand
is
the
least
certainly
said
the
dullal
i
go
to
do
your
bidding
go
said
my
father
alla
hafiz
be
sure
you
return
quickly
it
was
noon
before
he
returned
but
it
was
with
a
joyful
face
when
he
did
come
after
many
profound
salams
he
exclaimed
to
my
father
you
have
indeed
been
fortunate
your
good
destiny
has
gained
you
a
good
bargain
i
have
got
thirty
thousand
six
hundred
rupees
for
the
whole
we
had
a
long
fight
about
it
and
wasted
much
breath
but
blessed
be
narayun
your
slave
has
been
successful
see
here
is
the
acknowledgment
my
father
took
it
and
pretended
to
read
i
was
near
laughing
outright
at
his
gravity
as
he
took
the
paper
and
pored
over
the
crabbed
hindee
characters
of
which
he
did
not
understand
one
nor
indeed
any
other
for
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
yes
said
he
gravely
it
is
satisfactory
now
how
am
i
to
be
paid
the
sahoukar
will
arrange
that
with
you
in
any
way
you
please
said
the
dullal
ready
money
or
bills
are
equally
at
your
service
but
as
all
transactions
are
generally
at
six
months
credit
the
interest
for
that
time
at
the
usual
rate
will
be
deducted
and
if
i
take
bills
i
suppose
the
interest
will
be
allowed
till
i
reach
benares
or
whatever
place
i
may
take
them
upon
certainly
good
continued
my
father
do
you
attend
here
with
the
sahoukar
and
we
will
settle
all
about
it
and
he
can
take
away
the
merchandize
whenever
he
pleases
so
the
dullal
departed
it
was
now
about
the
time
when
the
tazeas
were
to
be
brought
to
the
edge
of
the
river
to
be
thrown
into
the
water
and
as
the
karwan
was
not
far
from
the
spot
i
proposed
to
my
father
to
send
for
our
horses
and
ride
thither
to
see
the
sight
he
agreed
the
horses
were
quickly
brought
and
we
rode
to
the
bridge
over
which
the
road
passes
into
the
city
taking
our
stand
upon
it
we
beheld
beneath
us
the
various
and
motley
groups
in
the
bed
of
the
river
there
were
thousands
assembled
the
banks
of
the
river
and
the
bed
were
full
so
full
it
seemed
as
if
you
might
have
walked
upon
the
heads
of
the
multitude
the
and
the
tinsel
of
the
various
tazeas
glittered
in
the
afternoon
sun
the
endless
variety
of
colours
of
the
dresses
had
a
cheerful
and
gay
effect
and
though
it
was
nothing
to
the
grand
appearance
of
the
procession
at
night
still
it
was
worth
looking
at
the
tazeas
were
brought
one
by
one
by
the
various
tribes
or
neighbourhoods
to
which
they
belonged
and
thrown
into
the
pools
in
the
bed
of
the
river
for
deep
water
there
was
none
but
there
was
sufficient
for
the
purpose
and
as
each
glittering
fabric
was
cast
in
it
was
assailed
by
hundreds
of
little
ragged
urchins
who
quickly
tore
the
whole
to
pieces
for
the
sake
of
the
ornaments
and
there
was
many
a
warm
contest
and
scramble
over
these
remains
which
excited
the
laughter
of
the
bystanders
one
by
one
the
various
groups
returned
towards
their
homes
looking
wearied
and
exhausted
for
the
excitement
which
had
kept
them
up
for
so
many
days
and
nights
was
gone
in
many
a
shady
corner
might
be
seen
lying
fast
asleep
an
exhausted
wretch
his
finery
still
hanging
about
him
his
last
cowree
perhaps
expended
in
a
copious
dose
of
bhung
which
having
done
part
of
its
work
in
exciting
him
almost
to
madness
during
the
preceding
night
had
left
him
with
a
racking
brain
and
had
finally
sent
him
into
oblivion
of
his
fatigue
and
hunger
the
mohorum
was
ended
we
stayed
on
the
bridge
till
the
time
for
evening
prayer
when
repairing
to
an
adjacent
mosque
we
offered
up
our
devotions
with
the
others
of
the
faithful
who
were
there
assembled
this
done
i
told
my
father
i
should
again
visit
zora
and
most
likely
remain
at
her
house
all
night
he
bid
me
be
sure
to
return
early
in
the
morning
on
account
of
our
business
and
having
promised
this
i
departed
i
rode
slowly
through
the
now
silent
and
almost
deserted
streets
the
few
persons
whom
i
met
were
hurrying
along
to
their
homes
and
had
no
common
feeling
or
interest
with
each
other
as
before
i
passed
along
the
now
track
and
was
soon
at
the
house
which
held
all
that
was
most
dear
to
me
on
earth
i
sent
up
my
name
and
dismounted
i
expected
the
usual
summons
and
that
i
should
see
that
countenance
i
longed
to
behold
welcoming
me
from
the
window
i
waited
longer
than
i
could
assign
a
cause
for
in
my
own
mind
at
last
my
attendant
returned
and
as
he
quitted
the
threshold
the
door
was
rudely
shut
after
him
while
at
the
same
time
the
casements
of
the
windows
were
both
shut
what
was
i
to
think
of
this
alas
my
forebodings
were
but
too
just
my
attendant
broke
in
upon
my
thoughts
by
addressing
me
her
mother
whom
i
have
seen
said
he
bid
me
give
you
her
salam
and
tell
you
that
her
daughter
is
particularly
engaged
and
can
not
receive
you
i
ventured
to
remonstrate
but
the
old
woman
became
angry
and
told
me
that
she
had
behaved
civilly
to
you
and
that
you
could
not
expect
more
and
further
she
said
him
from
me
that
he
had
better
act
the
part
of
a
wise
man
and
forget
zora
for
never
again
shall
he
see
her
it
will
be
in
vain
that
he
searches
for
her
for
she
will
be
beyond
his
reach
and
i
would
rather
that
she
died
than
become
the
associate
and
partner
of
an
adventurer
like
him
who
for
all
i
know
might
inveigle
her
from
home
and
when
he
was
tired
of
her
leave
her
in
some
jungle
to
starve
go
and
tell
him
this
and
say
that
if
he
is
a
wise
man
he
will
forget
her
and
was
this
all
exclaimed
i
in
a
fury
was
this
all
the
hag
said
i
will
see
whether
i
can
not
effect
an
entrance
and
i
rushed
at
the
door
with
all
my
might
in
vain
i
pushed
and
battered
it
with
the
hilt
of
my
sword
it
was
too
securely
fastened
within
to
give
way
i
called
out
zora
name
i
raved
i
threatened
as
loud
as
i
could
to
destroy
myself
at
the
door
and
that
my
blood
would
be
upon
the
head
of
that
cruel
old
woman
it
was
all
in
vain
not
a
bolt
stirred
not
a
shutter
moved
and
i
sat
down
in
very
despair
a
few
persons
had
collected
observing
my
wild
demeanour
and
as
i
looked
up
from
my
knees
where
my
face
had
been
hidden
one
of
them
said
poor
youth
it
is
a
pity
his
love
has
been
unkind
and
will
not
admit
him
pooh
said
another
he
is
drunk
with
bhung
alla
knows
whether
we
are
safe
so
near
him
he
has
arms
in
his
hands
we
ought
to
get
out
of
his
way
your
drunken
persons
are
ticklish
people
to
deal
with
let
alone
their
being
a
scandal
to
the
faith
i
was
ashamed
shame
for
once
conquered
anger
i
walked
towards
my
horse
and
mounting
him
rode
slowly
from
the
place
how
desolate
everything
appeared
the
night
before
i
had
reached
the
summit
of
happiness
i
cast
one
look
to
the
window
where
i
had
sat
in
sweet
converse
with
her
whom
i
was
destined
no
more
to
behold
i
thought
on
her
words
and
the
glittering
scene
was
again
before
me
now
all
was
dark
and
silent
and
accorded
well
with
my
feelings
i
rode
home
in
this
mood
and
throwing
myself
down
on
my
carpet
gave
myself
up
to
the
bitterness
of
my
feelings
and
unavailing
regret
a
thousand
schemes
i
revolved
in
my
mind
for
the
recovery
of
zora
during
that
night
for
i
slept
not
one
by
one
i
dismissed
them
as
cheating
me
with
vain
hopes
only
to
be
succeeded
by
others
equally
vague
and
unsatisfactory
i
rose
in
the
morning
feverish
and
unrefreshed
having
determined
on
nothing
there
was
only
one
hope
that
of
the
old
woman
the
nurse
if
i
could
but
speak
with
her
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
effect
something
and
as
soon
as
i
could
summon
one
of
the
men
who
had
attended
zora
i
sent
him
for
information
chapter
xvi
i
had
not
seen
bhudrinath
now
for
some
days
and
fearing
he
might
think
me
neglectful
i
went
to
the
serai
in
which
he
and
the
men
had
put
up
ah
cried
he
when
he
saw
me
approach
so
we
are
at
last
permitted
to
see
the
light
of
your
countenance
what
in
the
name
of
bhowanee
have
you
been
about
i
have
sought
you
in
vain
for
the
last
three
days
tell
me
said
i
what
you
have
been
doing
and
you
shall
know
my
adventures
afterwards
well
then
said
he
in
the
first
place
i
have
made
a
series
of
poojahs
and
sacrifices
at
the
different
temples
around
this
most
mahomedan
of
cities
secondly
i
have
seen
and
mixed
in
the
mohorum
and
lastly
i
have
assisted
to
kill
seven
persons
killed
seven
persons
i
exclaimed
in
wonder
how
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
did
you
manage
that
nothing
more
easy
my
gay
young
jemadar
he
replied
do
you
not
know
that
this
is
the
karwan
where
travellers
daily
arrive
in
numbers
and
from
which
others
are
as
frequently
departing
nothing
is
easier
than
to
beguile
them
to
accompany
us
a
short
distance
pretending
that
we
are
going
the
same
road
why
a
thug
might
live
here
for
ever
and
get
a
decent
living
the
people
my
blessings
on
them
are
most
unsuspicious
and
thanks
to
hunooman
and
his
legions
there
is
no
want
of
rocks
and
wild
roads
about
the
city
which
give
capital
opportunities
for
destroying
them
ajaib
i
exclaimed
this
is
very
wonderful
and
who
were
they
not
in
the
least
extraordinary
said
bhudrinath
coolly
if
you
think
on
it
but
to
answer
your
question
the
first
was
a
bunnea
who
was
going
to
beeder
we
took
him
to
golconda
and
buried
him
among
the
tombs
and
we
got
seventy
rupees
and
some
pieces
of
gold
from
him
the
second
were
two
men
and
their
wives
who
said
they
were
going
to
koorungul
where
that
is
bhugwan
knows
but
it
is
somewhere
in
a
southerly
direction
we
killed
them
about
three
coss
from
the
city
among
some
rocks
and
left
them
there
that
was
wrong
said
i
you
should
have
buried
them
not
at
all
wrong
my
friend
who
will
take
the
trouble
of
inquiring
after
them
besides
we
had
not
time
for
the
day
had
fully
dawned
and
we
feared
interruption
from
travellers
we
got
above
two
hundred
rupees
and
two
ponies
which
i
have
sold
for
thirty
rupees
well
said
i
these
make
five
and
the
other
two
they
lie
there
said
bhudrinath
pointing
to
where
a
horse
was
picketed
they
were
poor
devils
and
not
worth
the
trouble
of
taking
out
we
only
got
rupees
from
both
dangerous
work
said
i
you
might
have
been
seen
oh
no
fear
of
an
old
hand
like
me
every
one
was
off
to
the
city
to
gape
at
the
show
and
we
were
left
alone
i
was
deliberating
whether
we
should
not
accompany
them
on
the
road
we
came
in
by
and
by
which
they
were
going
but
surfuraz
khan
cut
short
my
doubts
and
uncertainties
by
strangling
one
fellow
on
the
spot
and
i
followed
his
example
with
the
other
the
bodies
were
concealed
till
night
and
then
buried
but
is
there
no
fear
of
the
grave
bursting
i
asked
he
laughed
fear
oh
no
they
lie
deep
enough
and
you
know
our
old
tricks
well
said
i
it
is
most
satisfactory
and
i
have
missed
all
this
have
been
a
fool
and
have
lost
my
mistress
into
the
bargain
bhudrinath
laughed
immoderately
but
seeing
the
gravity
of
my
face
he
said
never
mind
meer
sahib
care
not
for
my
merriment
but
truly
thy
face
wore
so
lackadaisical
an
expression
that
for
my
life
i
could
not
have
refrained
cheer
up
man
there
is
plenty
of
work
in
store
for
you
women
will
be
faithless
and
young
and
fellows
will
grieve
for
them
but
take
a
friend
advice
make
your
profession
your
mistress
and
she
at
least
will
never
disappoint
you
your
advice
is
good
said
i
nevertheless
the
mistress
i
have
lost
is
as
you
know
worthy
of
regret
and
i
shall
miss
her
for
many
a
day
but
tell
me
what
have
you
now
in
hand
anything
in
which
i
may
have
a
share
why
no
he
replied
nothing
but
if
you
are
so
inclined
we
will
take
a
ramble
this
evening
through
the
bazars
we
may
perhaps
pick
up
somebody
of
course
i
will
be
with
you
for
in
truth
my
hand
will
get
out
of
practice
if
i
neglect
work
but
have
you
seen
my
father
i
have
not
said
bhudrinath
i
hear
he
is
very
much
engaged
about
the
property
and
do
not
like
to
disturb
him
you
are
right
he
is
said
i
but
he
will
finish
all
and
get
the
money
i
suppose
after
that
we
shall
not
stay
long
here
and
for
my
part
i
care
not
how
soon
we
set
off
i
am
anxious
for
new
scenes
and
adventures
and
we
are
not
likely
to
do
much
here
is
not
surfuraz
khan
here
no
he
is
gone
with
a
party
of
seven
travellers
towards
puttuncherroo
and
has
taken
ten
or
fifteen
of
the
best
of
the
men
with
him
he
will
not
be
back
probably
before
night
if
then
who
were
the
travellers
bunneas
i
heard
said
bhudrinath
carelessly
i
did
not
see
them
myself
and
surfuraz
khan
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
give
me
any
information
out
upon
me
i
exclaimed
vexed
at
my
idleness
here
have
i
been
amusing
myself
while
all
this
has
been
going
on
for
the
sake
of
the
prophet
let
us
do
something
soon
that
i
may
settle
scores
with
my
conscience
for
i
have
hardly
assurance
enough
to
look
you
in
the
face
after
my
behaviour
well
said
he
come
this
evening
if
we
ca
decoy
any
one
we
will
kill
somebody
for
amusement
and
practice
i
agree
said
i
for
by
alla
i
must
do
something
i
am
as
melancholy
as
a
camel
and
my
blood
which
boiled
enough
yesterday
seems
now
scarcely
to
run
through
me
it
is
not
to
be
borne
i
found
when
i
reached
home
that
the
dullal
had
arrived
and
with
him
the
sahoukar
clerk
and
some
porters
to
carry
the
goods
as
well
as
fellows
with
matchlocks
and
lighted
matches
and
others
with
swords
and
shields
to
escort
them
i
stared
at
them
one
would
think
you
were
going
to
battle
séthjee
said
i
with
all
those
fierce
fellows
i
am
half
afraid
of
them
the
fellows
laughed
and
the
clerk
replied
they
are
necessary
and
we
always
have
them
if
our
goods
were
stolen
nay
carried
off
before
our
eyes
should
we
get
any
redress
no
indeed
we
therefore
protect
our
property
the
best
way
we
can
now
said
my
father
take
your
goods
and
be
off
with
them
they
are
no
longer
mine
and
i
fear
to
allow
them
to
remain
under
my
roof
surely
said
the
clerk
they
will
be
out
of
your
way
directly
and
now
let
us
speak
about
your
money
or
will
you
take
some
merchandise
as
part
of
it
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
replied
my
father
i
want
all
my
money
in
rupees
no
stay
not
all
in
rupees
give
me
five
thousand
in
silver
and
the
rest
in
gold
it
will
be
easier
carried
i
suppose
you
mean
five
thousand
rupees
and
the
rest
in
gold
bars
well
you
must
purchase
gold
according
to
weight
and
the
best
is
twenty
rupees
a
tola
but
you
had
better
take
bills
and
the
exchange
is
favourable
no
no
no
bills
said
my
father
but
the
gold
if
i
remember
rightly
the
price
of
gold
was
high
when
i
left
delhi
and
was
likely
to
remain
so
and
i
have
plenty
of
persons
for
my
guard
if
robbers
should
attack
me
you
forget
me
cried
the
dullal
and
my
percentage
make
yourself
easy
said
i
it
will
be
paid
out
of
the
five
thousand
rupees
it
will
be
about
fifteen
hundred
i
think
what
did
you
say
fifteen
hundred
to
whom
asked
the
clerk
to
this
dullal
said
i
i
suspect
the
rascal
is
cheating
us
cheating
surely
he
is
why
mohun
das
good
man
what
have
you
been
about
are
you
mad
to
ask
so
much
ah
it
was
my
lord
offer
and
promise
said
he
and
surely
i
shall
now
get
it
pray
what
business
is
it
of
yours
what
ought
he
to
have
asked
my
father
one
per
cent
is
ample
replied
the
other
and
you
might
have
saved
this
too
if
you
had
only
applied
yourself
to
the
different
sahoukars
we
were
strangers
said
i
and
knew
not
their
places
of
residence
so
we
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
this
rascal
who
offered
his
services
what
did
you
not
take
me
from
the
did
you
not
promise
me
five
per
and
bind
me
to
secrecy
about
the
sale
of
your
goods
cried
the
dullal
listen
to
him
said
my
father
he
raves
now
meer
sahib
did
not
this
bhurwa
come
begging
and
beseeching
for
employment
and
when
i
said
i
would
try
him
and
asked
his
terms
he
said
he
was
miserably
poor
and
would
take
whatever
was
given
him
was
it
not
so
and
now
we
are
to
be
bearded
in
this
manner
defrauded
of
fifteen
hundred
rupees
where
we
have
not
as
many
cowrees
to
give
and
made
to
eat
dirt
into
the
bargain
beat
him
on
the
mouth
with
a
shoe
spit
on
him
may
he
be
defiled
so
that
ganges
water
would
not
purify
him
may
his
mother
sisters
and
all
his
female
relatives
be
nay
my
good
friend
said
the
sahoukar
clerk
be
not
thus
rash
and
nor
waste
your
breath
upon
so
mean
a
wretch
since
you
have
employed
him
something
must
be
given
it
is
the
custom
and
next
time
you
will
know
better
say
may
i
pay
him
the
one
per
which
will
be
three
hundred
and
six
rupees
three
hundred
and
six
rupees
alla
alla
where
am
i
to
get
the
half
cried
my
father
for
the
love
of
the
prophet
get
me
off
what
you
can
i
swear
by
your
head
and
eyes
that
i
am
a
poor
man
and
only
an
agent
is
it
not
so
meer
sahib
am
i
not
miserably
poor
you
certainly
can
not
afford
to
pay
so
much
money
as
one
per
cent
on
this
large
sum
i
replied
nevertheless
as
such
appears
to
be
the
custom
you
had
better
give
something
say
one
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
certainly
said
my
father
i
am
ready
i
will
not
refuse
anything
in
reason
but
so
large
a
sum
i
was
quite
astounded
at
the
impertinence
of
the
demand
and
lost
my
temper
like
a
fool
mohun
das
stood
all
this
time
with
his
eyes
and
mouth
wide
open
looking
from
one
to
the
other
every
word
that
was
uttered
increasing
his
astonishment
and
disappointment
do
you
pretend
to
say
screamed
he
at
last
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
i
am
not
to
get
my
money
my
fifteen
hundred
rupees
for
which
i
have
toiled
night
and
day
and
do
you
pretend
to
say
i
came
to
you
first
did
you
not
take
me
with
you
from
the
nay
here
is
the
again
for
the
sake
of
alla
said
i
to
the
clerk
if
you
really
know
this
fellow
advise
him
to
be
quiet
what
have
i
who
am
a
soldier
to
do
with
his
filthy
traffic
he
may
provoke
a
patient
man
once
too
often
and
people
with
weapons
in
their
hands
are
not
safe
persons
to
play
jokes
with
and
i
twisted
up
my
mustachios
i
have
told
you
sahib
what
a
coward
the
fellow
was
he
fell
instantly
on
the
ground
and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
floor
pardon
pardon
he
cried
most
brave
sirs
anything
whatever
you
choose
to
give
me
even
ten
rupees
will
be
thankfully
received
but
do
not
kill
me
do
not
put
me
to
death
see
i
fall
at
your
feet
i
rub
my
nose
in
the
dust
you
fool
cried
the
clerk
holding
his
sides
with
laughter
for
he
was
a
fat
man
you
fool
ah
mohun
das
that
i
should
have
seen
this
in
the
name
of
narayun
who
will
do
you
any
harm
are
you
a
child
you
with
those
mustachios
shame
on
you
man
dullal
as
you
are
be
something
less
of
a
coward
get
up
ask
for
your
money
boldly
ask
for
whatever
these
gentlemen
please
to
give
you
though
indeed
you
deserve
nothing
for
your
impertinent
attempt
at
deception
he
got
up
and
stood
on
his
left
leg
with
the
sole
of
the
right
foot
against
the
calf
his
hands
joined
his
turban
all
awry
and
the
expression
of
his
face
most
ludicrously
miserable
ten
rupees
my
lord
he
faltered
out
your
slave
will
take
ten
rupees
we
all
once
more
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
the
sides
appeared
to
ache
and
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
ai
bhugwan
ai
narayun
cried
he
catching
his
breath
that
i
should
have
seen
this
ai
sitaram
but
it
is
most
amusing
ten
rupees
why
man
said
he
to
the
miserable
dullal
you
just
now
wanted
fifteen
hundred
nay
said
my
father
let
him
have
his
due
you
said
one
hundred
and
fifty
that
he
shall
have
do
you
meer
sahib
go
with
this
worthy
sahoukar
to
his
kothee
and
bring
the
money
i
dare
say
he
will
give
you
a
guard
back
and
you
can
hire
a
porter
for
the
gold
and
silver
certainly
you
shall
have
the
men
said
the
gomashta
and
now
come
along
i
shall
have
to
collect
the
gold
and
it
may
be
late
before
it
can
be
weighed
and
delivered
to
you
and
the
rupees
passed
by
a
suraff
as
we
went
on
the
dullal
said
to
me
you
will
pay
me
at
the
kothee
will
you
not
we
will
see
said
i
the
money
is
none
of
mine
and
i
will
ask
advice
on
the
subject
not
your
money
whose
then
why
his
who
has
employed
you
and
from
whom
you
are
to
get
one
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
i
said
are
you
a
fool
why
do
you
ask
ah
nothing
only
i
was
thinking
thinking
of
what
i
asked
some
rascality
i
doubt
not
ah
said
he
now
you
speak
as
you
did
at
the
by
alla
said
i
stopping
and
looking
at
him
if
ever
you
mention
that
word
again
never
never
cried
the
wretch
trembling
do
not
beat
me
remember
it
is
the
open
street
and
there
will
be
a
disturbance
the
words
escaped
me
unawares
just
as
i
was
thinking
that
is
twice
you
have
said
that
and
by
alla
i
think
you
have
some
meaning
in
it
what
you
be
at
nothing
nothing
said
he
only
i
was
thinking
well
i
was
only
thinking
that
you
are
an
adventurer
who
has
accompanied
that
rich
merchant
from
hindostan
well
and
what
of
that
you
knew
that
before
you
are
not
rich
no
indeed
said
i
i
am
not
then
said
the
wretch
why
not
both
of
us
enrich
ourselves
how
i
asked
refuse
the
guard
or
take
some
men
i
will
guide
you
to
they
will
do
whatever
you
like
for
five
rupees
a
piece
we
will
fly
with
the
money
and
there
is
a
place
in
the
rocks
close
to
this
where
i
have
plunder
hidden
we
will
go
thither
and
share
it
where
is
the
place
you
allude
to
is
it
far
i
asked
no
said
he
will
you
come
i
can
show
it
you
from
a
distance
we
need
not
get
up
the
rocks
there
is
danger
of
being
seen
in
the
daytime
i
followed
him
for
a
little
distance
and
he
pointed
to
a
huge
pile
of
rocks
at
the
back
of
the
karwan
and
begum
bazar
there
do
you
see
a
white
spot
about
up
on
a
rock
i
do
said
i
that
is
the
spot
he
replied
it
is
known
but
to
myself
and
a
few
others
whatever
i
can
pick
up
i
put
there
what
do
you
get
ah
little
enough
sometimes
a
shawl
a
brocade
handkerchief
or
some
gold
anything
in
fact
but
why
do
you
ask
will
you
do
what
i
said
and
join
us
there
are
sixteen
of
us
one

yonder
disguised
as
a
fakeer
the
rest
are
hard
by
and

accompany
us

cried
i
dashing
him
to
the
earth
dog
dost
thou
know
to
whom
thou
speakest
here
there
is
no
one
for
we
had
got
to
the
back
of
the
houses
and
it
were
an
easy
task
to
send
thee
to
jehanum
one
blow
of
my
sword
and
that
false
tongue
would
cease
to
speak
for
ever
and
i
half
drew
it
i
knew
the
effect
this
would
have
there
was
the
same
grovelling
cowardice
he
had
displayed
before
he
clung
to
my
knees
i
spurned
him
and
spit
on
him
reptile
cried
i
at
length
wearied
by
his
abjectness
i
would
scorn
to
touch
thee
a
syud
of
hindostan
is
too
proud
to
stoop
to
such
game
as
thou
art
lead
me
to
the
sahoukar
for
by
alla
i
distrust
thee
nay
in
this
matter

have
been
honest
said
the
wretch
the
money
is
sure
it
will
be
well
for
thee
that
it
is
said
i
or
i
swear
to
be
revenged

on
and
beware
how
you
go
if
i
see
one
attempt
at
escape
i
will
cut
you
in
two
were
it
in
the
middle
of
the
bazar
then
follow
me
closely
said
he
and
he
gathered
up
his
garments
which
had
become
disordered
and
we
again
entered
the
crowded
bazar
we
were
soon
at
the
sahoukar
who
awaited
us
the
money
and
gold
were
told
out
and
a
receipt
i
had
brought
with
me
given
and
accompanied
by
the
guard
of
soldiers
i
took
the
treasure
to
my
father
meer
sahib
kind
meer
sahib
said
the
dullal
as
we
approached
our
dwelling
you
will
forget
all
that
has
passed
bhugwan
knows
i
was
only
jesting
with
you
i
love
to
play
such
tricks
nay
i
have
always
been
of
a
jesting
disposition
and
he
laughed
in
his
terror
you
will
not
forget
my
little
perquisite
my
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
i
know
you
will
not
peace
cried
i
if
you
wish
to
get
a
cowree
has
it
not
been
promised
to
thee
on
the
word
of
two
of
the
faithful
thou
shalt
get
the
uttermost
farthing
i
dismissed
the
sepoys
with
a
small
present
when
the
money
had
been
lodged
in
our
and
as
they
went
the
miserable
dullal
looked
after
them
as
though
he
thought
with
them
had
departed
his
last
chance
for
existence
it
certainly
drew
to
a
close
give
me
my
money
and
let
me
depart
said
he
in
a
hollow
voice
wait
said
i
till
it
is
counted
out
for
you
ah
i
had
forgotten
the
dullaljee
cried
my
father
i
will
get
out
his
due
chapter
xvii
my
father
counted
out
the
money
and
handed
it
over
to
the
dullal
his
countenance
brightened
as
he
viewed
it
and
he
made
numberless
salams
and
protestations
of
thanks
now
you
must
write
a
receipt
for
the
money
said
my
father
surely
replied
the
fellow
taking
a
pen
out
of
his
turban
if
my
lord
will
give
me
paper
and
ink
here
they
are
said
i
write
he
did
so
gave
me
the
paper
and
tied
the
money
up
in
a
corner
of
his
dhotee
which
he
tucked
into
his
waistband
have
i
permission
to
depart
he
asked
my
lord
knows
the
poor
dullal
and
that
he
has
behaved
honestly
in
this
transaction
whenever
my
lord
returns
to
hyderabad
he
can
always
hear
of
mohun
das
if
he
inquires
at
the
char
minar
and
he
will
always
be
ready
to
exert
himself
in
his
service
stay
said
i
i
have
somewhat
to
say
to
thee
and
i
related
to
my
father
the
whole
of
the
conversation
i
have
just
described
is
it
so
said
he
to
the
miserable
being
before
him
is
it
so
speak
wretch
let
me
hear
the
truth
from
thy
own
lips
wouldst
thou
have
robbed
me
but
the
creature
he
addressed
was
mute
he
stood
paralysed
by
fear
and
conscious
guilt
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
his
mouth
open
and
his
blanched
lips
drawn
tightly
across
his
teeth
thou
hast
deserved
it
continued
my
father
i
read
in
that
vile
face
of
thine
deeds
of
robbery
of
murder
of
knavery
and
villany
of
every
kind
thou
must
die
ah
no
no
die
my
lord
is
pleased
to
be
facetious
what
has
his
poor
slave
done
and
he
grinned
a
ghastly
smile
thou
wouldst
have
robbed
me
said
my
father
when
i
trusted
thee
with
my
whole
substance
thou
wouldst
have
left
me
to
starve
in
a
strange
land
without
compunction
thou
hast
robbed
others
and
cheated
thousands
say
art
thou
fit
to
live
to
prey
longer
upon
the
world
thou
hast
already
despoiled
he
threw
himself
at
my
father
feet
he
grasped
his
knees
he
could
scarcely
speak
and
was
fearfully
convulsed
and
agitated
by
extreme
terror
i
am
all
that
you
say
he
cried
thief
murderer
and
villain
but
oh
do
not
kill
me
my
lord
face
is
kind
i
can
not
die
and
my
lord
has
no
sword
and
how
will
he
kill
me
he
had
only
just
perceived
that
we
were
both
unarmed
and
he
made
a
sudden
rush
at
the
door
the
kotwal
shall
know
of
this
he
cried
people
are
not
to
be
terrified
with
impunity
the
door
was
fastened
he
gave
several
desperate
pulls
and
pushes
at
it
but
i
was
at
his
back
and
the
fatal
handkerchief
was
over
his
head
he
turned
round
and
glared
on
me
the
next
instant
he
was
dead
at
my
feet
there
cried
my
father
exultingly
judgment
has
overtaken
him
and
the
memory
of
his
crimes
will
sleep
with
him
for
ever
we
have
done
a
good
deed
yes
said
i
a
good
one
indeed
he
confessed
himself
to
be
a
murderer
robber
and
knave
what
more
need
you
and
so
young
too
for
this
accumulation
of
crime
drag
him
in
here
said
my
father
i
like
not
to
look
on
him
and
go
for
the
luggaees
he
must
be
buried
at
night
in
the
small
yard
of
the
house
i
dare
not
have
the
body
carried
out
in
this
crowded
city
it
shall
be
done
i
replied
but
think
what
an
escape
we
have
had
had
you
not
told
me
to
go
with
the
wretch
we
should
have
lost
our
money
yes
my
son
and
even
had
we
got
it
had
you
not
suspected
that
five
per
cent
was
too
much
i
should
certainly
have
paid
the
sum
but
i
saw
your
drift
and
i
think
took
up
the
clue
admirably
we
have
cheated
the
knave
both
out
of
his
money
and
his
life
true
said
i
it
has
been
a
good
adventure
and
amusing
withal
besides
it
promises
further
advantage
from
the
rock
and
the
fakeer
yes
there
will
be
good
booty
take
care
said
my
father
the
band
may
be
there
and
they
will
give
you
a
warm
reception
i
will
go
and
consult
with
bhudrinath
said
i
the
adventure
will
just
suit
him
and
surfuraz
khan
we
will
do
nothing
rashly
bhudrinath
was
at
the
serai
waiting
for
me
so
meer
sahib
said
he
you
are
still
in
the
humour
for
a
frolic
how
many
lives
will
satisfy
your
worship
there
is
no
lack
of
men
in
this
abode
of
villany
i
am
in
the
humour
said
i
but
not
for
what
i
intended
i
have
better
game
in
view
ha
said
he
so
have
been
acting
sotha
and
pray
what
may
this
game
be
one
that
will
require
stout
hearts
and
maybe
naked
weapons
i
replied
are
you
willing
to
accompany
me
to
death
said
bhudrinath
but
i
can
not
for
my
life
see
what
you
are
driving
at
listen
i
replied
and
i
related
to
him
the
whole
history
of
the
dullal
cleverly
done
very
cleverly
indeed
my
young
jemadar
said
he
when
my
relation
was
ended
no
one
could
have
managed
it
better
from
first
to
last
the
rascal
deserved
his
fate
and
now
i
suppose
we
must
search
out
these
hidden
treasures
in
the
rock
exactly
said
i
i
would
do
so
this
very
night
if
i
knew
how
to
go
about
it
properly
let
me
see
said
bhudrinath
musing
we
shall
not
want
many
men
six
or
eight
resolute
fellows
will
be
sufficient
you
and
i
peer
khan
and
four
others
are
ample
there
is
no
use
waiting
for
surfuraz
khan
he
will
not
now
be
back
before
the
morning
but
how
to
get
intelligence
of
the
place
and
whether
any
of
the
rascals
are
there
at
night
can
no
one
personate
a
fakeer
said
i
a
kulundur
anything
will
do
he
might
go
up
now
as
the
spot
is
close
by
and
bring
us
news
in
an
hour
or
so
i
have
it
cried
bhudrinath
here
some
one
call
shekhjee
to
me
shekhjee
came
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
but
he
was
an
able
fellow
and
a
rare
good
hand
with
the
handkerchief
shekhjee
said
bhudrinath
sit
down
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
you
can
personate
a
fakeer
if
necessary
can
you
not
certainly
replied
the
old
fellow
moosulman
or
hindoo
all
kinds
are
familiar
to
me
i
know
all
their
forms
of
speech
and
have
many
of
their
dresses
it
is
well
said
bhudrinath
now
listen
you
must
go
and
disguise
yourself
this
instant
we
have
an
enterprise
in
view
and
he
related
our
proposed
scheme
and
what
had
preceded
it
and
now
continued
bhudrinath
you
must
be
wary
and
by
dark
you
must
return
and
tell
us
of
the
place
and
if
there
are
men
there
is
the
fakeer
who
lives
there
a
hindoo
or
moosulman
i
saw
the
impression
of
spread
hands
in
whitewash
on
the
rock
so
he
must
be
a
moosulman
said
i
then
i
know
how
to
act
cried
the
thug
sahibs
i
take
my
leave
and
will
not
fail
you
i
shall
be
with
you
by
the
time
i
am
required
will
he
manage
it
i
asked
of
bhudrinath
methinks
it
is
a
delicate
business
never
fear
him
said
bhudrinath
he
is
a
most
accomplished
rogue
and
is
a
capital
hand
at
disguise
especially
as
a
fakeer
and
once
got
us
considerable
booty
by
enticing
five
nanukshaee
fakeers
among
us
who
had
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
money
and
were
going
to
build
a
well
with
it
besides
he
is
as
brave
as
a
lion
and
you
have
seen
his
other
work
as
we
were
talking
surfuraz
khan
came
in
ours
has
been
a
good
business
he
cried
exultingly
and
there
is
good
spoil
we
have
killed
all
the
men
and
the
plunder
is
coming
in
charge
of
our
fellows
that
is
so
far
good
said
i
but
is
there
any
ready
money
or
is
it
all
goods
both
meer
sahib
both
but
methinks
you
need
not
be
so
ready
to
ask
when
we
have
not
seen
your
face
ever
since
we
have
been
in
the
city
we
might
all
have
been
taken
and
safely
lodged
in
puntoo
lall
huwélee
for
all
you
knew
of
the
matter
i
do
not
like
such
conduct
i
was
enraged
at
his
speech
and
was
about
making
an
angry
reply
when
bhudrinath
interfered
peace
said
he
no
brawls
it
is
disgraceful
and
only
fit
for
drunkards
and
smokers
of
ganja
listen
to
me
surfuraz
khan
you
are
no
boy
and
ought
not
to
let
your
anger
have
sway
listen
and
hear
what
our
young
jemadar
has
been
about
and
i
swear
by
bhowanee
i
think
he
will
yet
put
us
all
to
shame
he
then
related
all
i
had
told
him
on
hearing
which
surfuraz
angry
feelings
gave
way
in
a
moment
he
rose
and
embraced
me
i
was
wrong
said
he
and
you
must
forgive
me
and
to
prove
that
i
am
more
than
ever
your
friend
i
beg
you
to
allow
me
a
place
in
this
adventure
for
by
alla
it
promises
to
be
a
strange
one
willingly
said
i
we
thought
you
would
not
arrive
in
time
but
now
you
are
come
i
would
not
on
any
account
that
you
did
not
accompany
us
so
you
have
strangled
the
fellows
you
took
out
said
bhudrinath
had
you
any
trouble
none
whatever
replied
the
khan
we
took
them
out
on
the
masulipatam
road
and
found
a
spot
on
the
other
side
of
surroonuggur
we
threw
the
bodies
into
a
well
and
returned
by
another
road
soobhan
alla
this
is
a
rare
place
and
we
might
remain
here
for
years
and
have
some
amusement
every
day
i
think
i
shall
stay
here
you
may
do
as
you
please
about
that
said
i
when
we
have
shared
the
spoil
we
have
got
you
will
then
be
free
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
lose
you
in
such
conversation
we
continued
till
it
was
dusk
and
then
assembling
the
men
we
intended
to
take
eight
in
all
and
seeing
that
our
arms
were
in
good
order
we
waited
in
great
anxiety
for
the
return
of
our
emissary
at
last
he
came
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
said
he
i
went
up
to
the
place
and
found
the
fakeer
he
is
a
fine
sturdy
young
fellow
and
at
first
warned
me
to
descend
but
when
i
told
him
i
was
hungry
and
weary
that
i
had
just
arrived
from
hindostan
and
did
not
know
where
to
lay
my
head
and
begged
for
a
crust
of
bread
and
water
in
the
name
of
the
twelve
imaums
he
was
pacified
and
admitted
me
into
his
cave
gave
me
some
food
and
a
hookah
and
we
sat
carousing
for
some
time
i
pulled
out
my
and
took
a
very
little
seeing
it
he
begged
for
some
and
has
taken
such
a
dose
that
he
will
not
wake
till
morning
i
left
him
fast
asleep
he
shall
never
wake
again
said
i
but
did
you
observe
the
place
where
can
the
plunder
be
hidden
he
lives
in
a
cave
between
two
enormous
rocks
said
shekhjee
it
was
nearly
all
in
darkness
but
i
saw
a
corner
at
the
back
of
it
built
up
with
mud
and
stones
which
he
said
was
his
and
i
suspect
it
is
there
that
the
plunder
is
concealed
come
then
said
i
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
if
we
delay
we
may
chance
to
find
the
rest
of
the
gang
this
is
just
the
hour
at
which
they
are
all
out
in
the
bazars
stealing
what
they
can
we
all
sallied
out
and
conducted
by
our
guide
crept
stealthily
along
the
foot
of
the
rocks
till
we
gained
the
narrow
pathway
by
which
we
were
to
ascend
we
held
a
moment
conference
in
whispers
and
bidding
five
of
the
men
stay
below
until
we
should
tell
them
to
ascend
bhudrinath
myself
and
surfuraz
khan
crept
up
the
narrow
track
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
whither
the
old
thug
had
preceded
us
he
still
sleeps
said
he
in
a
whisper
but
tread
softly
lest
you
wake
him
he
lies
yonder
close
by
the
lamp
mind
he
is
mine
said
i
to
bhudrinath
do
you
and
surfuraz
khan
hold
him
for
as
i
looked
on
the
powerful
form
before
me
i
felt
this
precaution
to
be
necessary
but
he
slept
how
was
i
to
throw
the
roomal
about
his
neck
bhudrinath
solved
the
difficulty
he
gave
the
fakeer
a
smart
blow
with
the
flat
of
his
sheathed
sword
upon
the
stomach
and
the
fellow
started
up
to
a
sitting
posture
what
is
this
thieves
was
all
he
could
say
my
handkerchief
was
ready
and
now
it
never
failed
me
he
was
dead
in
an
instant
now
trim
the
lamp
said
i
to
bhudrinath
call
up
three
of
the
men
and
let
the
others
remain
below
to
look
out
bhudrinath
tore
a
piece
of
rag
off
the
clothes
of
the
dead
fakeer
which
he
twisted
up
into
a
thick
wick
and
put
into
the
oil
vessel
its
strong
glare
lighted
up
the
interior
of
the
cave
and
we
saw
everything
distinctly
here
is
the
wall
which
i
spoke
of
said
shekhjee
and
we
had
better
search
behind
it
we
did
so
there
were
piles
of
earthen
jars
in
one
corner
which
we
at
first
supposed
to
contain
grain
or
flour
and
indeed
the
first
two
we
uncovered
had
rice
and
dal
in
them
the
third
felt
heavy
this
has
something
in
it
beyond
rice
said
i
examine
it
closely
the
mouth
was
stuffed
with
rags
but
when
they
were
removed
we
beheld
it
filled
with
money
rupees
and
pice
mixed
together
this
was
not
wise
said
bhudrinath
the
shah
sahib
ought
not
to
have
mixed
his
copper
and
silver
the
silver
will
be
tarnished
but
we
can
clean
it
the
next
pot
was
the
same
the
last
was
the
best
it
was
full
of
gold
and
silver
ornaments
rings
anklets
and
armlets
we
shuddered
to
see
that
many
of
them
were
stained
with
blood
the
villains
i
exclaimed
that
wretch
then
told
the
truth
when
he
confessed
himself
to
be
a
murderer
the
city
is
well
rid
of
him
but
we
must
not
stand
talking
do
one
of
ye
tie
these
things
up
and
be
ready
for
a
start
while
we
look
out
for
further
spoil
but
there
was
nothing
else
in
this
corner
no
bales
of
cloth
or
other
articles
as
we
had
expected
we
were
looking
about
to
find
any
other
place
of
concealment
and
had
nearly
given
up
our
search
when
surfuraz
khan
who
had
gone
outside
called
to
us
come
here
he
cried
there
is
a
place
here
which
looks
suspicious
we
ran
to
the
spot
and
found
the
hole
he
had
discovered
to
be
between
two
rocks
it
was
dark
within
and
a
man
could
but
just
enter
by
crawling
upon
his
hands
and
knees
give
me
the
light
said
i
i
will
enter
it
if
the
devil
were
inside
better
the
devil
than
any
of
this
infernal
gang
said
bhudrinath
to
me
as
i
entered
i
found
no
one
and
the
space
within
which
was
so
low
that
i
could
scarcely
stand
upright
was
filled
with
bundles
neither
the
devil
nor
any
of
the
gang
are
here
cried
i
to
those
outside
so
do
some
of
you
come
in
quickly
and
see
what
i
have
found
i
set
myself
to
work
as
did
also
the
others
to
untie
the
different
bundles
and
we
were
all
busily
employed
i
had
just
opened
one
which
contained
as
i
thought
brass
and
and
was
overjoyed
to
find
some
gold
and
others
silver
when
the
alarm
was
given
from
outside
we
all
got
out
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
inquired
the
cause
there
are
two
men
said
the
scouts
whom
we
have
watched
come
round
the
corner
of
the
houses
yonder
and
approach
the
bottom
of
the
rocks
they
do
not
walk
fast
and
appear
to
be
carrying
loads
of
something
only
two
said
i
then
they
are
easily
managed
put
out
the
light
and
conceal
yourselves
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
we
must
fall
upon
them
as
they
enter
we
had
just
taken
our
posts
behind
a
rock
which
was
close
to
the
mouth
our
roomals
ready
and
two
with
their
swords
drawn
when
one
of
the
fellows
called
out
ho
sein
sein
come
down
and
help
us
up
here
we
are
laden
like
and
thou
hast
not
even
a
light
to
show
us
the
way
not
a
word
said
i
as
you
value
your
lives
let
them
come
may
his
mother
be
defiled
said
the
other
fellow
the
beast
is
drunk
in
his
den
and
does
not
hear
us
i
will
settle
with
him
for
this
i
suppose
he
stumbled
and
fell
for
there
was
another
series
of
execrations
at
the
fakeer
the
load
and
the
stones
but
in
a
few
moments
more
they
both
reached
the
platform
and
threw
down
their
bundles
which
clanked
as
they
fell
where
is
this
drunken
rascal
said
one
a
tall
fellow
as
big
as
the
one
we
had
killed
no
light
for
us
and
i
warrant
the
brute
has
either
smoked
himself
dead
drunk
or
is
away
at
the
just
when
he
is
wanted
the
other
sat
down
apparently
fairly
tired
and
out
of
breath
go
inside
said
he
you
will
find
the
lamp
and
cruse
of
oil
behind
the
wall
i
will
not
stir
an
inch
the
first
speaker
entered
cursing
and
abusing
the
fakeer
surfuraz
khan
and
i
rushed
on
him
and
despatched
him
but
the
other
hearing
the
scuffle
cried
out
and
attempted
to
escape
he
was
not
fated
to
do
so
however
his
foot
slipped
or
he
stumbled
over
one
of
the
bundles
he
had
brought
and
fell
and
before
he
could
rise
had
received
his
by
a
cut
in
the
neck
from
one
of
the
men
behind
the
rock
who
darted
out
upon
him
enough
of
this
work
said
i
we
had
better
be
off
first
however
let
us
pay
one
more
visit
to
the
hole
and
get
what
we
can
and
do
one
of
you
see
what
is
in
the
bundles
we
again
entered
the
hole
and
each
taking
a
bundle
we
got
out
those
the
fellows
had
brought
only
contained
and
a
few
cloths
so
we
left
them
behind
and
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
serai
laden
with
our
booty
i
have
forgotten
to
tell
you
sahib
how
many
more
proofs
we
discovered
in
that
cave
of
the
bloody
trade
of
these
villains
many
of
the
bundles
were
of
wearing
apparel
and
most
of
them
covered
with
blood
one
that
i
opened
was
quite
saturated
and
as
the
still
wet
gore
stuck
to
my
fingers
i
dropped
it
with
mingled
disgust
and
horror
chapter
xviii
when
we
returned
we
had
a
good
laugh
over
our
success
the
adventure
was
novel
to
us
all
and
we
pictured
to
ourselves
the
mortification
and
chagrin
of
the
robbers
when
they
should
arrive
at
finding
their
stronghold
plundered
of
all
its
valuables
and
their
friends
lying
dead
at
the
threshold
instead
of
being
ready
to
receive
them
and
recount
their
adventures
of
the
evening
as
a
better
place
of
security
i
took
the
jewels
and
silver
vessels
i
had
found
to
our
house
and
locked
them
up
in
the
to
be
disposed
of
afterwards
as
best
they
might
be
my
father
i
need
not
say
was
overpowered
with
joy
and
every
new
feat
that
i
performed
seemed
to
render
me
more
dear
to
him
he
caressed
me
as
though
i
had
still
been
a
child
wait
till
these
actions
are
known
in
hindostan
my
son
said
he
with
enthusiasm
i
am
much
mistaken
indeed
if
they
do
not
raise
you
to
a
rank
which
has
been
attained
by
few
that
of
subadar
i
did
not
reply
to
him
but
i
made
an
inward
determination
to
venture
everything
to
attain
it
i
was
aware
that
nothing
but
a
very
successful
expedition
coupled
with
large
booty
and
a
deed
of
some
notoriety
and
daring
could
raise
me
to
the
rank
my
father
had
mentioned
but
that
it
could
be
attained
i
had
no
doubt
since
others
had
reached
it
before
me
and
why
should
not
i
whose
whole
soul
was
bent
upon
winning
fame
through
deeds
which
men
should
tremble
to
hear
two
days
after
our
adventure
at
the
robbers
cave
the
whole
of
the
karwan
and
adjacent
neighbourhood
were
thrown
into
great
excitement
from
the
discovery
of
the
dead
bodies
by
their
smell
and
the
number
of
vultures
they
attracted
various
were
the
conjectures
as
to
the
perpetrators
of
the
violent
deed
and
many
attributed
it
to
the
treachery
of
some
of
the
band
of
robbers
however
all
agreed
that
a
great
benefit
had
been
done
by
unknown
agents
much
of
the
stolen
property
was
recovered
among
it
was
some
of
great
value
which
had
been
stolen
from
a
sahoukar
a
short
time
before
and
which
in
our
hurry
and
confusion
had
escaped
us
but
as
it
was
we
had
got
a
considerable
booty
all
the
gold
and
silver
was
secretly
melted
into
lumps
by
one
of
our
men
who
understood
how
to
do
it
and
it
was
valued
by
weight
at
upwards
of
seven
thousand
rupees
on
a
general
division
of
the
proceeds
of
the
booty
being
proposed
which
amounted
in
a
gross
sum
by
the
sale
of
the
camels
horses
bullocks
carts
and
various
valuables
to
about
fifty
thousand
rupees
all
the
thugs
agreed
that
it
had
better
be
reserved
until
the
return
of
the
expedition
to
our
village
and
meanwhile
twenty
rupees
were
disbursed
to
each
inferior
and
fifty
to
each
jemadar
for
their
present
wants
my
father
now
talked
of
leaving
the
city
but
i
entreated
a
further
stay
of
ten
days
as
in
concert
with
bhudrinath
and
surfuraz
khan
i
had
laid
out
a
plan
for
dividing
our
gang
into
four
portions
one
to
take
post
on
each
side
of
the
city
and
to
exercise
our
vocation
separately
the
proceeds
to
be
deposited
as
collected
in
one
place
and
to
be
divided
when
we
could
no
longer
carry
on
our
work
the
plan
was
favourably
received
by
him
and
that
day
it
was
put
into
execution
we
paid
the
trifling
rent
of
our
house
and
on
the
pretence
that
we
were
about
to
leave
the
city
and
return
to
hindostan
quitted
the
karwan
and
took
up
our
quarters
on
the
other
side
in
a
suburb
which
bordered
upon
the
meer
joomla
tank
bhudrinath
and
his
party
went
into
the
chuddar
ghat
bazar
near
the
magnificent
mansion
of
the
resident
as
being
a
grand
thoroughfare
it
was
frequented
by
numerous
travellers
and
from
thence
branched
off
many
roads
both
to
the
north
and
east
surfuraz
khan
with
eight
men
continued
at
the
karwan
as
he
was
less
known
than
we
were
another
larger
party
took
post
on
the
western
road
from
the
city
towards
shumshabad
under
peer
khan
and
who
were
resolved
by
their
exertions
to
merit
the
trust
which
had
been
confided
to
them
our
plan
succeeded
wonderfully
not
a
day
passed
in
which
the
destruction
of
several
parties
was
not
reported
and
though
the
booty
gained
was
inconsiderable
yet
it
was
probably
as
much
as
we
could
expect
and
it
was
all
collected
and
deposited
in
our
new
abode
from
whence
my
father
disposed
of
such
as
met
a
ready
sale
i
pass
over
my
own
share
in
these
little
affairs
i
had
thought
when
i
selected
the
quarter
i
did
that
there
would
have
been
more
work
than
turned
out
to
be
the
case
i
was
disappointed
in
the
small
share
which
fell
to
my
lot
in
despite
of
my
utmost
exertions
to
the
contrary
and
entreated
bhudrinath
or
surfuraz
khan
to
exchange
places
with
me
they
however
would
not
they
had
laid
their
own
plans
and
as
i
had
myself
selected
my
station
i
had
no
right
to
any
other
nor
ought
i
to
have
been
dissatisfied
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
after
we
had
commenced
operations
that
bhudrinath
came
to
me
in
great
alarm
we
must
fly
said
he
the
city
is
no
longer
safe
for
us
how
i
asked
in
astonishment
what
has
happened
has
aught
been
discovered
or
have
any
of
the
band
proved
faithless
and
denounced
us
i
will
tell
you
replied
bhudrinath
it
is
a
sad
affair
some
of
our
best
men
are
taken
and
in
confinement
you
know
surfuraz
khan
to
be
daring
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
discretion
and
that
for
this
reason
few
hitherto
have
liked
to
trust
themselves
to
his
guidance
and
but
for
this
fault
he
would
ere
now
have
been
one
of
our
leading
jemadars
for
he
is
a
thug
by
descent
of
many
generations
and
his
family
has
always
been
powerful
but
the
matter
cried
i
impatiently
what
in
the
name
of
shitan
have
we
to
do
with
his
ancestors
by
alla
you
are
as
bad
as
a
nay
i
was
not
going
to
make
a
story
about
it
said
bhudrinath
mildly
for
nothing
could
provoke
him
so
do
not
lose
your
temper
but
listen
surfuraz
khan
then
yesterday
evening
had
got
hold
of
two
sahoukars
who
were
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
aurungabad
he
persuaded
them
to
put
up
in
the
serai
with
him
and
they
were
to
start
the
next
morning
they
were
supposed
to
be
rich
as
their
effects
in
two
panniers
were
brought
into
the
serai
and
carefully
watched
by
them
by
some
unlucky
chance
just
as
the
evening
set
in
they
were
visited
by
two
or
three
other
merchants
whom
they
seemed
to
know
and
who
persuaded
them
to
wait
for
another
week
and
to
join
them
in
their
journey
up
the
country
to
the
extreme
mortification
of
surfuraz
khan
they
agreed
to
the
proposal
but
as
they
said
there
would
be
danger
in
removing
their
bags
from
the
serai
at
night
they
told
their
friends
they
would
sleep
there
and
join
them
in
the
morning
surfuraz
khan
i
hear
made
every
exertion
by
persuasion
to
induce
them
to
alter
their
determination
but
in
vain
so
you
know
there
remained
but
one
alternative
which
was
to
put
them
to
death
in
the
serai
and
to
dispose
of
the
bodies
as
well
as
they
could
besides
the
circumstance
of
the
men
being
afraid
to
risk
their
bags
by
removal
at
night
looked
as
though
they
were
of
value
i
must
own
meer
sahib
it
was
tempting
it
would
even
have
been
so
for
you
or
me
how
much
more
for
the
khan
had
he
even
waited
till
towards
morning
done
the
business
and
started
leaving
the
bodies
where
they
were
he
could
have
got
clean
off
with
the
booty
which
was
large
and
he
could
have
come
round
the
back
of
the
city
and
joined
you
or
me
any
one
of
us
could
have
taken
his
post
in
the
karwan
and
no
one
would
have
been
at
all
suspicious
but
no
he
did
not
reflect
the
men
were
killed
almost
immediately
after
their
friends
left
and
their
bags
plundered
as
it
is
we
have
got
some
of
the
spoil
in
the
shape
of
two
strings
of
pearls
but
the
best
are
gone
and
how
was
the
matter
discovered
you
have
not
said
why
continued
bhudrinath
one
of
the
sahoukars
friends
shortly
after
returned
with
a
message
surfuraz
khan
made
some
excuse
that
they
had
gone
out
but
would
soon
return
the
fellow
waited
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
growing
suspicious
he
went
away
and
returned
with
the
others
who
insisted
upon
a
search
for
their
friends
surfuraz
khan
had
contrived
to
bury
the
bodies
in
the
yard
but
some
articles
were
found
on
his
person
which
the
others
positively
swore
to
as
also
the
bags
in
which
they
had
been
and
the
upshot
of
the
whole
was
that
they
were
all
marched
off
to
the
city
by
a
guard
which
was
summoned
from
somewhere
or
other
for
the
purpose
except
one
of
them
by
name
himmat
khan
one
of
surfuraz
own
people
who
happened
to
be
absent
it
is
a
sad
business
truly
said
i
and
i
do
not
exactly
see
what
is
to
be
done
to
extricate
them
nor
i
replied
bhudrinath
but
this
evil
comes
of
not
taking
the
omens
nor
attending
properly
to
them
when
they
are
taken
nonsense
said
i
you
are
always
prating
about
these
foolish
omens
as
if
success
lay
more
in
them
than
in
stout
hearts
and
cunning
plans
i
believe
them
not
you
will
rue
it
then
one
day
or
other
said
bhudrinath
depend
upon
it
you
will
rue
it
i
tell
you
i
could
mention
a
hundred
instances
of
the
disastrous
effects
of
disregard
of
omens
and
what
i
say
will
be
readily
confirmed
by
your
father
pooh
said
i
he
is
as
superstitious
and
absurd
as
yourself
why
do
you
not
make
your
lamentations
on
my
want
of
faith
to
him
instead
of
troubling
me
with
them
i
would
he
replied
but
that
he
seems
to
have
given
over
the
charge
of
the
whole
expedition
to
you
and
to
have
forgotten
his
station
as
the
leader
and
conductor
did
any
one
ever
hear
of
a
whole
band
being
separated
and
each
pursuing
a
separate
course
without
the
omens
being
taken
or
a
solemn
sacrifice
offered
to
bhowanee
i
thought
that
you
had
performed
all
the
rites
you
seem
to
think
so
necessary
said
i
sneeringly
and
if
you
have
not
to
whom
else
have
we
to
look
but
to
you
who
are
the
by
alla
and
his
prophet
bhudrinath
methinks
you
have
deceived
us
all
and
said
i
my
anger
rising
i
bid
you
beware
how
you
speak
of
my
father
as
you
have
done
remember
that
i
am
able
and
willing
to
avenge
any
word
which
may
be
spoken
against
him
and
i
will
do
it
young
man
said
bhudrinath
gravely
you
well
know
me
to
be
one
who
never
enters
into
idle
brawls
or
quarrels
and
these
angry
words
of
yours
are
wasted
keep
them
i
pray
you
for
those
who
will
gratify
you
by
taking
offence
at
them
to
me
they
are
trifles
your
placing
no
dependence
upon
the
omens
which
have
been
considered
by
thugs
both
of
your
faith
and
mine
to
be
essential
to
our
success
is
only
attributable
to
your
inexperience
the
necessary
offerings
have
been
neglected
by
us
and
behold
the
punishment
though
at
present
it
has
fallen
lightly
upon
us
there
is
no
saying
how
soon
the
whole
of
us
may
be
in
danger
suppose
any
of
those
taken
are
put
to
the
torture
and
denounce
us
how
could
we
escape
then
what
do
you
counsel
said
i
i
would
first
propose
an
offering
to
bhowanee
and
then
such
measures
for
the
deliverance
of
those
who
have
been
seized
as
may
be
hereafter
determined
on
by
us
all
perform
the
ceremonies
by
all
means
said
i
you
and
my
father
know
how
to
do
so
my
ignorance
might
mar
your
object
so
i
will
keep
away
from
you
till
they
are
over
you
are
right
it
might
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
at
length
speak
reasonably
where
is
your
father
you
will
find
him
asleep
within
said
i
and
you
had
better
go
to
him
sahib
the
sacrifices
were
made
the
omens
watched
and
declared
to
be
favourable
what
they
were
i
know
not
i
cared
so
little
about
these
ceremonies
then
that
i
did
not
go
near
them
or
even
ask
what
had
been
done
it
was
only
in
after
days
that
their
value
and
importance
were
impressed
upon
me
by
a
series
of
misfortunes
which
were
no
doubt
sent
to
check
my
presumption
since
then
my
faith
in
them
has
been
steadfast
as
you
shall
hereafter
learn
my
father
and
bhudrinath
returned
to
me
with
joyful
countenances
bhowanee
is
propitious
said
they
in
spite
of
this
little
display
of
her
anger
the
truth
is
we
had
in
some
manner
neglected
her
but
she
is
now
satisfied
since
that
is
the
case
said
i
we
had
better
be
stirring
and
doing
something
for
the
poor
fellows
but
what
to
do
i
know
not
when
did
you
say
they
were
seized
bhudrinath
about
the
middle
of
the
night
then
they
are
now
in
confinement
somewhere
or
other
and
it
will
be
impossible
to
effect
their
release
by
day
a
bribe
i
dare
not
offer
for
they
say
hussein
ali
khan
the
kotwal
is
an
upright
man
when
is
it
likely
they
will
be
brought
before
him
i
know
not
said
bhudrinath
but
it
can
easily
be
ascertained
and
he
went
into
the
street
and
soon
returned
i
asked
an
old
bunnea
the
question
or
rather
at
what
time
the
kotwal
held
his
durbar
and
he
told
me
in
the
first
and
second
watches
of
the
night
then
said
i
they
must
be
rescued
by
force
and
i
will
do
it
impossible
cried
both
at
once
but
i
tell
you
i
will
do
it
said
i
where
is
himmat
khan
with
him
and
six
of
our
best
men
i
will
do
it
if
they
will
stand
by
me
do
any
of
them
know
the
kotwal
house
they
were
summoned
but
none
knew
it
then
said
i
i
will
go
even
now
and
find
it
out
and
will
return
when
my
plan
is
perfected
and
i
will
go
and
bring
some
of
my
men
said
bhudrinath
i
will
be
back
by
noon
see
that
they
bring
their
swords
and
shields
bhudrinath
some
of
them
may
volunteer
to
accompany
me
i
will
do
so
for
one
meer
sahib
i
have
confidence
in
you
in
spite
of
your
want
of
faith
and
he
laughed
i
understand
you
said
i
you
forgive
me
certainly
did
i
ever
quarrel
with
you
no
indeed
though
you
had
cause
i
was
foolish
why
what
is
all
this
said
my
father
you
have
not
surely
been
offended
with
each
other
it
is
nothing
i
replied
for
you
see
the
end
of
it
but
i
am
losing
time
i
must
depart
i
went
into
the
city
and
easily
got
a
person
to
show
me
the
habitation
it
was
in
a
long
narrow
street
which
did
not
appear
much
of
a
thoroughfare
this
exactly
suited
my
purpose
for
we
could
have
done
little
in
a
crowded
place
it
seemed
very
practicable
to
surprise
the
men
who
should
escort
our
friends
and
i
had
no
doubt
if
suddenly
attacked
they
would
scamper
off
and
leave
their
prisoners
to
their
fate
i
returned
and
laid
the
result
of
my
inquiries
before
my
father
he
was
not
averse
to
the
undertaking
but
was
in
much
alarm
at
the
prominent
part
i
should
have
to
play
and
the
chance
of
our
being
defeated
but
said
he
my
son
these
thoughts
are
the
cowardly
ones
which
affection
often
suggests
and
alla
forbid
they
should
have
any
effect
with
you
go
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
to
whose
protection
i
commend
you
towards
evening
therefore
myself
bhudrinath
and
six
others
two
of
whom
were
rajpoots
who
swore
to
die
rather
than
come
back
unsuccessful
went
into
the
city
we
separated
but
kept
in
view
of
each
other
and
they
all
followed
me
to
the
street
in
which
the
kotwal
resided
there
we
lounged
about
for
some
hours
and
i
grew
very
impatient
would
they
ever
come
had
they
even
before
this
been
tried
condemned
and
cast
into
prison
were
questions
i
asked
myself
a
thousand
times
that
the
durbar
was
being
held
i
knew
by
the
number
of
persons
who
went
in
and
came
out
of
the
house
but
still
there
was
no
sign
of
our
brethren
i
was
sitting
listlessly
in
the
shop
of
a
tumbolee
almost
the
only
one
in
the
street
when
himmat
khan
came
up
to
me
i
saw
by
his
face
that
he
had
news
and
descended
from
the
chubootra
upon
which
the
man
exposed
his
goods
and
turned
round
a
dark
corner
they
come
said
he
panting
for
breath
from
anxiety
i
have
been
watching
one
end
of
the
street
and
khoseal
sing
the
other
they
are
coming
by
my
end
and
will
be
now
about
up
and
by
whom
are
they
guarded
i
asked
oh
said
he
a
parcel
of
about
twenty
soldiers
with
old
muskets
we
could
cut
through
a
hundred
of
them
have
they
their
bayonets
fixed
i
inquired
they
have
but
what
of
that
they
are
cowardly
rascals
and
you
will
see
will
run
away
then
said
i
run
and
tell
bhudrinath
who
is
yonder
tell
him
to
walk
down
that
side
i
will
go
down
this
when
we
are
near
them
i
will
give
the
jhirnee
my
four
men
had
now
joined
me
as
i
told
them
to
do
if
they
saw
me
speak
to
any
one
bhudrinath
was
joined
by
his
and
by
khoseal
sing
who
had
given
up
his
watch
at
the
other
end
and
arrived
at
the
critical
moment
our
parties
proceeded
down
the
street
exactly
opposite
to
each
other
i
thought
not
of
danger
though
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
drawn
a
sword
in
anger
against
a
and
i
was
about
to
precipitate
myself
into
what
might
be
a
sudden
and
desperate
combat
our
shields
apparently
hung
loosely
and
easily
on
our
arms
but
they
were
tightly
grasped
and
our
swords
were
free
in
their
scabbards
i
saw
the
party
approach
they
marched
carelessly
and
had
not
the
arms
of
my
companions
been
tightly
bound
and
the
whole
tied
together
by
a
rope
which
the
leader
of
the
party
held
in
his
hand
they
might
have
easily
escaped
our
men
joined
together
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
when
we
were
close
to
the
coming
party
i
cried
in
a
loud
tone
bahee
pan
lao
it
was
the
signal
our
swords
flashed
from
their
scabbards
and
we
threw
ourselves
on
the
sepoys
i
cut
right
and
left
and
two
men
fell
the
others
were
as
successful
i
rushed
to
the
prisoners
and
a
few
strokes
of
my
sword
and
of
those
who
were
nearest
cut
their
bonds
and
they
were
free
as
himmat
khan
had
said
the
whole
of
the
sepoys
fled
on
the
instant
of
the
attack
fly
to
the
gates
my
brothers
or
they
will
be
shut
i
cried
fly
through
these
narrow
dark
streets
no
one
will
know
who
you
are
nor
trouble
themselves
about
you
we
all
dispersed
in
an
instant
i
cast
a
hurried
look
around
me
as
i
returned
my
bloody
sword
into
its
scabbard
and
saw
five
poor
wretches
lying
on
the
ground
and
groaning
it
was
enough
i
too
fled
down
the
nearest
street
which
offered
reached
the
gate
i
had
entered
by
and
when
i
got
on
the
embankment
of
the
meer
joomla
tank
i
plunged
among
the
gardens
and
inclosures
which
are
below
it
and
by
the
various
lanes
which
led
through
them
soon
reached
my
father
house
the
attack
on
the
escort
of
the
prisoners
sahib
was
so
sudden
and
over
so
quickly
that
i
can
give
you
but
a
faint
idea
how
soon
it
was
made
and
finished
it
occupied
less
time
than
i
have
taken
to
tell
it
and
i
have
often
wondered
since
that
the
noise
and
confusion
not
only
caused
by
us
but
by
a
few
passengers
who
witnessed
the
fray
did
not
alarm
the
whole
street
and
cause
the
inhabitants
to
rise
on
us
by
morning
all
our
companions
were
present
at
the
different
places
of
rendezvous
but
thinking
we
were
no
longer
safe
about
the
city
my
father
sent
them
all
out
of
the
way
to
the
camp
at
hassain
sagor
where
he
bid
them
wait
for
we
knew
that
it
would
never
be
searched
for
us
nothing
now
remained
to
detain
us
but
to
dispose
of
the
plunder
we
had
gained
during
the
last
ten
days
and
there
was
none
of
much
value
a
few
strings
of
pearls
several
shawls
and
some
unset
precious
stones
were
the
best
and
they
were
soon
sold
the
gold
and
silver
as
before
had
been
melted
down
chapter
xix
i
had
now
only
two
matters
on
my
hands
one
to
discover
zora
if
i
could
the
other
to
endeavour
to
get
the
bills
of
exchange
i
had
brought
with
me
cashed
of
the
first
i
had
but
little
hope
for
since
the
day
i
went
to
her
house
although
i
had
constantly
men
on
the
watch
about
it
i
could
discover
nothing
of
her
or
of
the
old
nurse
the
latter
i
had
bribed
handsomely
and
i
knew
if
it
was
possible
to
convey
to
me
any
information
of
her
i
loved
she
would
do
so
i
had
several
times
passed
the
house
myself
in
the
hope
of
seeing
zora
by
some
accident
or
other
but
it
was
in
vain
and
at
the
time
i
now
speak
of
i
had
almost
given
her
up
in
despair
had
it
not
been
sahib
for
the
wild
interest
of
my
trade
i
should
have
sunk
into
apathy
and
wretchedness
so
fondly
so
deeply
did
i
love
her
it
was
this
which
rescued
me
from
myself
for
i
could
not
be
behind
the
rest
in
seeking
adventures
and
once
that
i
had
a
band
entirely
under
my
own
direction
i
was
incessantly
occupied
in
finding
employment
for
it
and
taking
my
own
part
in
the
catastrophes
which
ensued
the
day
after
the
rescue
of
our
brethren
we
held
a
consultation
at
which
the
principal
members
of
the
band
were
present
i
need
not
relate
particulars
suffice
it
to
say
that
all
agreed
in
thinking
we
had
remained
long
enough
consistently
with
our
safety
and
it
was
resolved
to
depart
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
or
at
most
the
day
after
one
by
one
the
parties
as
they
were
then
divided
were
to
take
the
nearest
road
towards
beeder
which
led
through
puttuncherroo
and
the
place
was
to
be
the
rendezvous
whence
we
should
proceed
in
company
little
time
therefore
remained
to
me
and
as
soon
as
i
possibly
could
i
took
bhudrinath
and
with
me
and
we
went
into
the
city
we
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
the
char
minar
wonderful
indeed
were
the
stories
we
heard
of
our
skirmish
with
the
kotwal
soldiers
the
accounts
of
the
killed
and
wounded
on
each
side
were
ludicrously
inconsistent
and
you
may
imagine
how
we
enjoyed
the
various
relations
we
heard
all
either
from
persons
who
declared
that
they
had
been
eyewitnesses
of
the
matter
or
who
had
heard
it
from
undoubted
authority
but
it
was
not
our
errand
to
waste
time
by
listening
to
idle
tales
not
one
of
which
contained
a
word
of
truth
but
to
get
the
money
for
the
bills
we
had
found
among
the
effects
of
syud
mahomed
ali
alias
kumal
khan
and
we
had
repaired
to
the
char
minar
as
the
most
likely
place
to
meet
with
a
person
who
could
read
them
and
without
suspicion
tell
us
upon
whom
they
were
drawn
observing
as
we
sat
a
miserable
wretch
with
a
pen
stuck
between
his
turban
and
his
ear
an
hanging
by
his
side
and
a
roll
of
paper
under
his
arm
i
fixed
upon
him
as
a
likely
person
to
suit
our
purpose
i
beckoned
to
him
and
he
ran
eagerly
towards
us
canst
thou
read
goozerattee
i
asked
noble
sir
i
can
not
only
read
but
write
it
for
it
is
my
native
tongue
what
are
my
lord
commands
simply
said
i
to
read
a
hoondee
no
great
matter
and
i
handed
him
one
of
the
bills
it
is
an
order
sahib
drawn
in
favour
of
kumal
khan
my
lord
name
i
presume
by
bearee
mul
of
nandair
upon
gopal
chund
bisn
chund
of
the
begum
bazar
for
four
hundred
rupees
at
nine
days
sight
is
it
correctly
drawn
i
asked
the
fellow
looked
at
the
bill
and
turned
it
round
and
round
examining
every
part
of
it
does
your
worship
suspect
it
alla
forbid
said
i
for
if
it
is
wrong
i
and
these
worthy
associates
of
mine
are
ruined
for
we
have
more
like
it
and
for
larger
sums
i
see
nothing
wrong
in
the
bill
said
the
man
but
let
me
see
the
others
i
showed
them
they
are
all
correct
said
he
you
have
only
to
take
them
for
acceptance
and
you
are
sure
of
your
money
is
the
firm
upon
whom
they
are
drawn
well
known
they
have
a
great
deal
of
country
business
in
hoondees
said
the
man
and
are
on
that
account
perhaps
less
known
than
many
of
our
leading
bankers
but
nevertheless
the
firm
is
most
respectable
where
did
you
say
they
live
in
the
begum
bazar
if
your
worships
wish
it
i
will
accompany
you
thither
good
said
i
do
so
we
are
strangers
and
might
not
readily
find
the
house
you
shall
be
rewarded
for
your
trouble
we
went
out
of
the
city
by
a
small
gate
at
the
end
of
a
street
which
led
down
from
the
char
minar
i
think
it
is
called
the
delhi
gate
and
turning
to
the
left
after
crossing
the
river
we
were
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
populous
and
wealthy
suburb
in
which
the
bankers
we
sought
resided
the
road
through
the
principal
street
was
almost
entirely
blocked
up
by
bags
of
grain
bales
of
merchandize
tethered
bullocks
belonging
to
the
and
empty
carts
and
it
was
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
keep
together
both
from
these
causes
and
the
crowd
of
people
the
noise
too
of
the
crowd
of
the
buying
and
selling
in
the
bazar
the
curses
and
execrations
of
and
unloaders
the
cries
of
men
measuring
grain
and
a
thousand
others
made
a
din
and
confusion
which
i
had
never
heard
equalled
however
by
dint
of
pushing
and
elbowing
our
way
we
reached
a
house
and
were
introduced
to
one
of
the
partners
by
the
man
we
had
taken
with
us
i
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
and
presented
one
of
the
hoondees
the
sahoukar
was
an
old
man
and
taking
a
pair
of
spectacles
from
a
fold
in
his
turban
he
placed
them
on
the
end
of
his
nose
and
carefully
read
the
hoondee
he
afterwards
turned
it
round
and
round
and
examined
it
most
carefully
looking
from
time
to
time
most
suspiciously
at
me
over
his
glasses
i
own
this
would
have
been
unpleasant
had
i
been
alone
but
with
the
two
companions
i
had
brought
with
me
i
cared
not
had
it
come
to
the
worst
our
weapons
were
ready
and
we
would
have
used
them
for
our
liberty
i
wish
to
speak
a
few
words
with
you
if
you
will
follow
me
into
the
next
room
said
the
sahoukar
pointing
to
one
which
led
from
that
in
which
we
sat
he
rose
and
i
followed
him
how
came
you
to
be
possessed
of
this
said
he
anxiously
and
who
are
you
it
matters
not
who
i
am
i
replied
and
it
must
suffice
for
you
to
know
that
i
am
to
receive
the
money
for
that
hoondee
and
for
these
also
and
i
showed
him
the
others
most
extraordinary
he
exclaimed
after
he
had
examined
them
i
can
not
understand
it
it
is
most
strange
that
they
should
be
presented
by
another
young
man
by
what
authority
are
you
here
to
receive
this
money
by
his
for
whom
they
were
drawn
i
replied
his
name
and
the
sahoukar
who
drew
them
kumal
khan
and
the
sahoukar
bearee
mul
that
will
not
do
said
the
sahoukar
you
have
blundered
in
your
errand
young
man
the
drawer
name
any
one
could
have
told
you
perhaps
this
may
enlighten
you
further
upon
the
subject
said
i
and
i
took
from
my
waistband
the
seal
of
the
syud
he
examined
it
and
going
to
a
box
in
the
room
he
took
from
it
a
bundle
of
papers
he
turned
them
over
rapidly
ay
here
they
are
said
he
reading
of
syud
mahomed
ali
and
now
young
man
if
there
is
deceit
in
that
seal
it
can
be
easily
proved
for
behold
the
seal
of
the
worthy
syud
himself
and
he
showed
me
an
impression
on
one
of
the
papers
i
confess
i
had
been
in
much
suspense
for
had
i
by
any
unlucky
chance
got
hold
of
the
wrong
seal
my
detection
would
have
certainly
followed
but
still
i
had
taken
the
ring
from
the
man
own
finger
and
it
was
not
likely
that
he
had
any
other
the
instant
i
saw
the
impression
however
i
was
satisfied
that
it
was
the
right
one
now
for
the
proof
said
the
sahoukar
rubbing
the
seal
over
with
ink
and
wetting
a
piece
of
paper
with
his
tongue
if
you
have
attempted
deceit
young
man
your
detection
is
certain
shall
i
stamp
it
certainly
said
i
i
am
innocent
of
any
attempt
to
deceive
you
the
worthy
syud
gave
me
the
seal
in
order
that
you
might
be
satisfied
he
pressed
the
seal
to
the
paper
and
withdrew
it
the
impression
was
perfect
and
exactly
corresponded
with
that
on
the
paper
of
accounts
this
is
correct
he
said
at
length
though
i
can
not
read
persian
the
letters
appear
the
same
and
the
size
is
exact
i
can
not
therefore
doubt
longer
but
still
it
is
most
strange
i
can
only
say
said
i
that
i
am
the
syud
confidential
agent
whom
he
has
sent
to
you
for
the
money
if
you
will
not
pay
it
say
so
that
i
may
write
to
him
by
no
means
said
the
sahoukar
the
money
is
here
but
why
did
not
the
syud
come
himself
the
bills
are
made
payable
to
him
alone
true
said
i
they
are
but
if
you
are
in
his
confidence
as
you
seem
to
be
you
will
know
that
there
are
good
reasons
for
his
absence
from
the
city
at
present
and
as
he
wanted
the
money
he
has
sent
me
for
it
and
where
is
he
that
i
can
not
tell
you
said
i
it
can
be
divulged
to
no
one
suffice
it
for
you
to
know
that
when
the
proper
time
comes
he
will
emerge
from
his
place
of
concealment
and
i
told
the
truth
sahib
for
will
he
not
rise
at
the
day
of
judgment
and
ameer
ali
laughed
heartily
at
his
own
conceit
well
said
the
sahoukar
no
doubt
remains
as
to
your
right
to
the
money
when
do
you
want
it
the
bills
are
at
nine
days
sight
now
i
have
no
time
to
lose
i
must
depart
in
the
morning
you
can
deduct
the
interest
for
nine
days
but
stay
i
continued
the
syud
told
me
that
if
he
owed
you
anything
you
were
to
deduct
it
and
if
any
balance
of
his
remained
in
your
hands
you
were
to
pay
it
to
me
good
replied
the
sahoukar
i
will
see
and
he
turned
to
his
books
ah
here
is
the
account
last
balance
struck
the
fifteenth
of
suffer
nearly
a
year
ago
in
his
favour
three
hundred
and
twelve
rupees
four
annas
so
much
the
better
said
i
now
pay
me
the
moneys
and
write
a
receipt
i
will
sign
it
with
the
seal
which
i
must
take
back
with
me
the
sahoukar
called
to
a
man
inside
here
said
he
register
these
hoondees
and
get
the
money
for
them
and
make
out
a
receipt
your
name
said
he
to
me
ameer
ali
an
unworthy
syud
the
money
was
duly
counted
out
a
trifling
deduction
made
for
interest
and
the
whole
paid
to
me
i
put
my
own
seal
as
well
as
that
of
the
syud
to
the
receipt
and
after
seeing
the
balance
in
the
sahoukar
books
duly
cancelled
there
was
no
longer
cause
to
delay
how
will
you
carry
all
that
money
said
the
sahoukar
this
is
not
a
safe
place
for
people
to
be
seen
out
at
so
late
an
hour
for
the
evening
was
now
closing
fast
with
such
a
sum
in
their
possession
content
yourself
said
i
we
are
three
stout
fellows
and
well
able
to
defend
our
charge
you
had
better
take
two
of
my
men
at
any
rate
to
carry
the
money
i
will
carry
some
if
i
am
permitted
said
the
man
we
had
brought
with
us
bughwan
knows
i
have
eaten
nothing
and
knew
not
where
to
get
a
meal
till
these
kind
gentlemen
met
me
and
i
may
perhaps
earn
a
trifling
sum
above
what
they
have
promised
me
good
said
i
how
much
can
you
carry
two
thousand
rupees
he
replied
if
my
lord
will
try
me
very
well
then
take
up
that
bag
the
rest
we
divided
between
ourselves
and
departed
we
did
not
return
as
we
had
gone
but
avoiding
the
city
passed
by
the
house
of
the
english
resident
crossed
the
river
below
it
and
on
the
other
side
struck
into
some
close
lanes
which
led
to
the
suburb
we
lived
in
as
we
went
along
i
said
to
bhudrinath
in
ramasee
which
i
had
now
learned
that
fellow
must
not
live
our
secret
is
safe
with
the
sahoukar
but
not
with
another
what
do
you
say
i
agree
with
you
said
he
we
can
throw
the
body
into
a
well
and
there
is
one
not
far
off
i
think
i
bathed
there
this
morning
very
well
said
i
when
you
see
the
place
give
the
signal
i
will
settle
all
our
accounts
with
him
for
his
trouble
and
carriage
of
our
money
we
came
to
the
well
and
the
signal
was
given
i
was
ready
and
my
victim
also
but
he
struggled
hard
as
the
bag
of
rupees
was
on
his
shoulders
and
my
roomal
had
not
fair
play
he
died
however
and
we
threw
him
into
the
well
with
a
large
stone
tied
in
his
clothes
to
sink
him
strange
sahib
that
after
protesting
his
poverty
as
he
had
done
we
should
have
found
rupees
in
his
girdle
you
may
judge
of
my
father
joy
at
my
success
and
to
prove
his
sense
of
the
value
of
my
address
and
ready
wit
he
presented
me
with
five
hundred
rupees
out
of
the
sum
i
had
brought
with
this
at
my
disposal
i
determined
to
make
a
last
attempt
for
zora
for
i
thought
that
with
it
i
might
bribe
the
old
woman
who
called
herself
her
mother
and
late
as
it
was
i
pleaded
some
excuse
and
set
off
for
the
city
i
soon
reached
the
now
street
and
finding
the
door
open
i
entered
and
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
old
woman
and
zora
sister
zenat
they
rose
on
seeing
me
and
welcomed
me
kindly
you
have
not
been
with
us
meer
sahib
since
the
mohorum
said
the
old
woman
as
she
cracked
all
her
fingers
against
her
temples
you
knew
that
you
would
always
be
our
most
favoured
guest
and
yet
we
have
not
seen
you
why
has
there
been
this
estrangement
from
us
i
did
not
like
to
accuse
the
old
woman
of
turning
me
from
the
door
as
i
have
related
before
so
i
said
i
had
been
absent
from
the
city
and
having
only
just
returned
had
come
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
and
now
mother
said
i
where
is
zora
why
is
the
rose
separated
from
the
nightingale
zora
said
the
old
woman
why
have
you
not
forgotten
that
foolish
girl
is
there
not
zenatbee
who
is
dying
for
you
and
has
raved
about
you
ever
since
she
saw
you
toba
toba
cried
zenat
covering
her
face
affectedly
for
shame
mother
how
can
you
speak
so
how
can
you
tell
such
lies
i
say
the
truth
meer
sahib
i
swear
the
foolish
girl
head
has
been
turned
by
your
beauty
and
she
stroked
my
chin
caressingly
what
could
i
do
i
saw
at
once
that
if
i
did
not
affect
love
for
zenat
i
should
never
hear
aught
of
zora
but
i
could
not
forget
her
so
easily
and
i
hated
zenat
for
her
love
i
thought
it
better
to
come
to
terms
at
once
if
i
could
mother
said
i
i
am
proud
of
your
daughter
love
and
to
one
so
young
as
i
am
such
marks
of
preference
as
you
say
she
is
inclined
to
show
me
are
most
flattering
nevertheless
i
can
not
forget
zora
and
tell
me
by
your
soul
am
i
to
see
her
or
not
now
hear
me
i
am
not
a
rich
man
not
one
who
could
lavish
thousands
upon
her
but
what
i
have
is
hers
for
ever
and
yours
too
if
you
will
give
her
to
me
will
you
part
with
her
what
do
you
offer
said
the
old
woman
methinks
you
must
be
one
of
our
nobles
in
disguise
to
come
here
with
such
a
proposition
i
am
no
noble
said
i
but
a
poor
syud
i
have
five
hundred
rupees
and
they
are
yours
if
you
make
zora
mine
for
ever
say
the
word
and
i
will
be
present
we
will
send
for
a
moola
and
the
nika
shall
be
performed
five
hundred
rupees
cried
the
old
woman
and
she
and
her
daughter
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
five
hundred
rupees
continued
she
at
length
when
she
could
speak
oh
man
thou
art
either
mad
or
drunk
i
am
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
i
replied
very
angrily
i
am
as
sober
as
either
of
you
nay
far
more
so
then
if
you
are
so
said
the
old
wretch
what
in
the
name
of
alla
has
come
to
you
that
you
think
we
would
part
with
zora
for
five
hundred
rupees
five
thousand
and
twice
as
much
would
not
be
sufficient
then
said
i
you
are
a
pair
of
the
devil
children
and
i
spit
at
you
not
content
with
spurning
me
from
your
house
like
a
dog
you
now
deny
me
the
only
happiness
i
looked
to
on
earth
women
have
you
no
hearts
yes
cried
the
old
hag
in
a
fury
yes
we
did
spurn
you
as
i
do
now
begone
and
never
dare
to
intrude
as
you
have
done
this
night
or
i
will
see
if
i
can
not
bring
a
few
stout
fellows
together
to
beat
you
out
with
sticks
like
a
dog
and
a
son
of
a
dog
as
you
are
peace
woman
cried
i
beware
how
you
revile
my
father
may
his
mouth
be
filled
with
earth
and
his
grave
defiled
may
your
mother
i
could
bear
this
no
longer
i
ran
to
the
door
for
my
shoes
and
held
one
in
my
hand
threateningly
now
said
i
another
word
of
abuse
and
i
will
beat
you
on
the
mouth
it
did
not
check
her
a
fresh
torrent
poured
from
her
lips
and
i
was
really
provoked
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
rushed
at
her
beat
her
on
the
face
with
my
shoe
and
spat
on
her
the
daughter
hurried
to
the
and
raised
cries
of
alarm
thief
thief
he
is
murdering
us
kasim
mahomed
ali
where
are
ye
we
are
murdered
we
are
defamed
bring
your
swords
and
kill
him
i
had
pretty
well
belaboured
the
old
woman
and
thought
it
high
time
to
be
off
so
i
rushed
to
the
door
and
seizing
zenat
threw
her
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
with
all
my
force
i
saw
that
she
had
a
heavy
fall
and
i
ran
down
the
stairs
about
half
way
i
met
a
man
with
a
drawn
sword
he
stood
and
was
about
to
make
a
cut
at
me
but
i
seized
his
arm
and
hurled
him
down
the
steps
and
as
he
rolled
to
the
bottom
i
leaped
over
him
and
was
outside
the
house
in
a
moment
well
thought
i
as
i
went
along
i
have
not
got
zora
but
i
have
slippered
the
old
shitan
her
mother
which
is
some
satisfaction
and
bhudrinath
will
laugh
rarely
when
he
hears
of
my
exploit
chapter
xx
for
the
love
of
alla
young
man
cried
a
low
and
sweet
voice
as
i
passed
under
the
gateway
of
a
house
for
the
love
of
alla
enter
and
save
my
mistress
fresh
adventures
thought
i
as
i
looked
at
the
speaker
a
young
girl
dressed
like
a
slave
who
are
you
it
matters
not
said
the
speaker
did
you
not
pass
this
way
yesterday
afternoon
in
company
with
two
others
i
did
and
what
of
that
everything
my
mistress
who
is
more
beautiful
than
the
moon
at
its
full
saw
you
and
has
gone
mad
about
you
i
am
sorry
said
i
but
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
help
her
but
you
must
said
the
girl
you
must
or
she
will
die
follow
me
and
i
will
lead
you
to
her
i
hesitated
for
i
had
heard
strange
stories
of
lures
spread
for
unwary
persons
how
they
were
enticed
into
houses
for
the
gratification
of
wicked
women
and
then
murdered
but
the
thought
was
only
momentary
courage
ameer
ali
said
i
to
myself
trust
to
your
good
nusseeb
and
follow
it
up
inshalla
there
will
be
some
fun
look
you
said
i
to
the
girl
you
see
i
am
well
armed
i
will
follow
you
but
if
violence
is
shown
those
who
oppose
me
will
feel
the
edge
of
a
sharp
sword
i
swear
by
your
head
said
the
girl
there
is
no
danger
my
lord
is
gone
into
the
country
and
has
taken
all
the
men
with
him
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
beside
myself
but
two
slaves
and
three
old
women
then
lead
on
said
i
i
follow
you
she
entered
the
gateway
and
conducted
me
through
a
court
into
an
open
room
where
sat
a
girl
richly
dressed
and
of
great
beauty
but
she
covered
herself
immediately
with
her
dooputta
and
cried
when
she
saw
me
ya
alla
it
is
he
am
i
so
fortunate
yes
lady
said
i
your
slave
is
at
your
feet
and
prays
you
to
remove
that
veil
which
hides
a
hoori
of
paradise
from
the
gaze
of
a
true
believer
go
said
she
faintly
now
that
you
are
here
i
dare
not
look
on
you
go
in
the
name
of
alla
what
will
you
not
have
thought
of
me
that
your
slave
is
the
most
favoured
of
his
race
said
i
i
beseech
you
to
look
on
me
and
then
bid
me
depart
if
you
will
i
can
not
said
the
fair
girl
i
can
not
i
dare
not
ah
nurse
what
have
you
made
me
do
the
old
woman
made
me
a
sign
to
take
the
veil
from
her
face
and
i
did
so
gently
she
faintly
opposed
me
but
it
was
in
vain
in
an
instant
i
had
removed
it
and
a
pair
of
the
loveliest
eyes
i
had
ever
seen
fixed
their
trembling
gaze
upon
me
another
and
i
had
clasped
her
to
my
heart
that
is
right
said
the
old
woman
i
like
to
see
some
spirit
in
a
lover
mashalla
he
is
a
noble
youth
and
she
came
and
cracked
her
fingers
over
my
head
now
i
will
leave
you
said
she
you
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
and
the
night
is
wearing
fast
no
no
no
cried
the
girl
do
not
leave
us
stay
good
nurse
i
dare
not
trust
myself
with
him
alone
nonsense
cried
the
old
woman
this
is
foolishness
do
not
mind
her
noble
sir
and
she
left
the
room
lady
said
i
fear
not
your
slave
may
be
trusted
and
i
removed
from
her
and
sat
down
at
the
edge
of
the
carpet
i
know
not
what
you
will
think
of
me
sahib
she
said
and
i
am
at
a
loss
how
to
confess
that
i
was
enamoured
of
you
as
i
saw
you
pass
my
house
yesterday
but
so
it
was
my
liver
turned
to
water
as
i
looked
on
your
beauty
and
i
pined
for
you
till
my
attendants
thought
i
should
have
died
they
said
they
would
watch
for
you
and
alla
has
heard
my
prayer
and
sent
you
he
has
sent
a
devoted
slave
said
i
one
whose
soul
burns
with
love
such
as
that
of
the
bulbul
to
the
rose
speak
and
i
will
do
your
bidding
hear
my
history
and
you
will
know
then
how
i
am
to
be
pitied
said
the
fair
girl
and
it
is
told
in
a
few
words
i
was
the
daughter
of
humble
parents
but
i
was
as
you
see
me
they
say
i
am
beautiful
they
married
me
to
my
husband
so
they
said
but
they
sold
me
sahib
he
is
old
he
is
a
tyrant
he
has
beaten
me
with
his
shoe
and
i
have
sworn
on
his
koran
that
i
will
no
longer
remain
under
his
roof
yes
i
have
sworn
it
i
would
have
fled
yesterday
but
i
saw
you
and
i
prayed
alla
to
send
you
and
he
has
done
so
now
think
of
me
what
you
please
but
save
me
and
she
arose
and
throwing
herself
at
my
feet
clasped
my
knees
you
will
not
refuse
me
protection
if
you
do
and
your
heart
is
hard
towards
me
one
thing
alone
remains
i
have
prepared
a
bitter
draught
and
sun
will
look
upon
my
dead
body
alla
forbid
lady
said
i
he
who
has
sent
me
to
you
has
sent
you
a
willing
and
a
fearless
slave
fly
with
me
this
instant
and
i
will
lead
you
to
a
father
who
will
welcome
you
and
a
land
far
away
where
our
flight
will
never
be
discovered
now
so
soon
she
exclaimed
ay
lady
now

your
house
this
moment
i
will
protect
you
with
my
life
i
dare
not
sahib
i
dare
not

become
of
us
if

is
detected
in

an
intensity
of
passion

was
willing
that

your
head
and
eyes

poor

bidding
azima
gathered
courage
at
my
words
and
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
old
woman
kulloo
she
cried

house

the
nurse

old
woman

exclaimed
woman

a
vow

azima
and
did
not
you
say
you
would
take
me
to
present
a
nuzzur
at
the
shrine
of
the
holy
saint
if
i
recovered

my
last
illness

hit

the
nurse

generosity

she
sahib

have
loved

fair
girl
from
her
infancy
and
though
it
will
go
sorely
against
my
heart
i
will
give
her
into
your
hands

than
she
should
be
further
exposed
to
the
indignities
she
has
already
undergone

faith

the
old
woman
placing
her
hands
on
azima

swear

thine
enough
i
cried
i
am
content
now
one
embrace
and
i
leave

shall
be
missed
by
my
father
and
he
will
fear

murdered
in
this
wild
city

took
a
long
passionate
embrace
and
i
tore
myself
from
her

cried

the
durgah

the
street

and
the
same
slave
who
had
ushered

in
led
the

the
door

your
soul

your
father
and
mother
do

be
unfaithful
or
it
will
kill
her
i
need
not
swear
pretty
maiden
said
i
your
mistress
beauty
has
melted
my
heart
and
i
am
hers
for
ever
then
may
alla
protect
you
stranger
that
is
your
road
if
you
go
by
the
one
you
came
yesterday
i
turned
down
the
street
and
was
soon
at
home
my
father
was
asleep
and
i
lay
down
but
alla
alla
how
my
heart
beat
and
my
head
throbbed
a
thousand
times
i
wished
i
had
carried
off
the
beautiful
azima
a
thousand
times
i
cursed
my
own
folly
for
having
left
her
when
by
a
word
from
me
she
would
have
forsaken
home
and
every
tie
and
followed
me
but
it
was
too
late
in
the
midst
of
conflicting
thoughts
and
vain
regrets
i
fell
asleep
but
i
had
disturbed
dreams
i
thought
her
dishonoured
lord
had
surprised
us
as
we
tasted
draughts
of
love
and
a
sword
glittered
over
his
head
with
which
he
was
about
to
revenge
his
disgrace
again
i
fancied
one
of
the
moolas
of
the
durgah
to
be
him
and
just
as
she
was
about
to
depart
with
us
and
was
stepping
into
a
cart
he
rushed
to
her
and
seized
her
and
i
vainly
endeavoured
to
drag
her
from
him
i
woke
in
the
excitement
of
the
dream
and
my
father
stood
over
me
what
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
is
the
matter
with
you
ameer
ali
my
son
cried
the
old
man
it
is
the
hour
of
prayer
i
came
to
awake
you
and
i
find
you
tossing
wildly
in
your
sleep
and
calling
on
some
one
though
i
could
not
distinguish
the
name
it
sounded
like
a
woman
azima
i
think
what
have
you
been
about
had
you
any
bunij
last
night
bunij
was
the
cant
phrase
for
our
victims
and
i
shuddered
at
the
ideas
it
called
up
no
no
i
said
nothing
let
me
go
and
perform
my
ablutions
i
will
join
you
in
the
namaz
it
will
compose
my
thoughts
and
i
will
tell
you
our
prayers
finished
i
related
my
adventures
of
the
past
night
he
laughed
heartily
at
my
relation
of
the
scene
with
zora
mother
and
declared
i
had
served
her
rightly
but
when
i
came
to
that
with
azima
his
countenance
was
changed
and
troubled
however
he
heard
me
to
the
end
without
interruption
and
i
augured
favourably
from
it
i
concluded
all
by
throwing
myself
at
his
feet
and
imploring
his
sanction
to
our
union
you
have
gone
too
far
to
retract
ameer
ali
said
he
if
you
do
not
fulfil
your
promise
to
azima
she
will
drink
the
poison
she
has
prepared
you
will
be
one
cause
of
her
death
and
it
will
lie
heavy
on
your
conscience
therefore
on
this
account
i
give
you
my
sanction
i
am
now
old
a
few
years
must
see
my
end
and
all
i
have
long
wished
for
is
to
marry
you
respectably
and
to
see
your
children
i
endeavoured
to
effect
a
in
hindostan
before
we
left
but
i
was
unable
to
do
so
there
is
now
no
occasion
for
one
you
have
made
your
choice
and
must
abide
by
it
alla
has
sent
you
your
bride
and
you
must
take
her
take
her
with
my
blessing
and
you
say
she
is
beautiful
in
which
you
are
fortunate
money
you
will
want
as
you
have
promised
some
to
the
nurse
if
she
is
faithful
give
her
from
me
an
additional
fifty
rupees
and
you
had
better
take
gold
with
you
it
will
be
easier
carried
spoken
like
my
beloved
and
honoured
father
i
exclaimed
and
i
am
now
happy
i
ask
your
blessing
and
leave
you
to
carry
our
plans
into
execution
we
shall
meet
again
at
puttuncherroo
in
the
evening
inshalla
we
shall
he
replied
be
wary
and
careful
i
apprehend
no
danger
but
you
had
better
take
some
men
with
you
i
will
said
i
as
i
rose
to
depart
i
will
take
some
of
my
own
whom
i
can
trust
and
i
left
him
my
horse
was
soon
ready
and
my
men
prepared
but
some
conveyance
was
necessary
for
azima
and
i
ran
to
a
house
a
short
distance
off
where
dwelt
a
man
who
had
a
cart
for
hire
i
had
been
in
previous
treaty
with
him
to
be
ready
in
case
i
should
get
intelligence
of
zora
and
had
engaged
him
to
go
as
far
as
beeder
come
said
i
fazil
i
am
ready
and
the
time
is
come
and
the
lady
said
the
fellow
grinning
ah
she
is
ready
too
only
make
haste
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
give
me
twenty
rupees
for
my
mother
and
i
will
harness
the
bullocks
and
put
in
the
cushions
and
pillows
here
they
are
said
i
now
be
quick
by
your
soul
be
quick
i
will
be
back
instantly
said
he
and
he
disappeared
inside
his
house
but
returned
almost
immediately
with
the
cushions
and
curtains
of
his
cart
there
said
he
as
he
completed
his
preparations
and
jumped
on
the
pole
where
was
his
you
see
i
have
not
been
long
now
whither
shall
i
drive
to
the
city
no
said
i
to
hussain
shah
wullee
durgah
do
you
precede
and
we
will
follow
you
for
i
know
not
the
road
i
know
it
well
said
he
follow
me
closely
does
it
lead
through
the
begum
bazar
or
the
karwan
i
asked
through
both
or
either
just
as
you
please
and
is
there
no
other
way
there
is
but
it
is
somewhat
longer
we
must
go
by
the
english
residence
and
turn
up
towards
the
gosha
mahal
the
road
will
lead
us
far
behind
both
the
karwan
and
begum
bazar
that
will
do
said
i
i
wish
to
avoid
both
bismilla
then
cried
the
driver
let
us
proceed
and
twisting
the
tails
of
his
bullocks
a
few
gentle
hints
from
his
toes
about
their
set
them
off
into
a
trot
which
however
they
exchanged
for
a
more
sober
pace
before
we
had
got
far
i
allowed
him
to
proceed
to
some
distance
and
then
put
my
small
party
in
motion
chapter
xxi
we
soon
passed
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
held
on
our
way
towards
the
durgah
i
was
not
without
hope
that
we
might
fall
in
with
azima
on
the
road
but
in
this
i
was
disappointed
as
we
passed
over
the
brow
of
an
eminence
the
tombs
of
the
kings
of
golconda
broke
on
our
sight
occupying
the
whole
of
a
rising
ground
in
front
i
had
never
before
seen
them
indeed
i
knew
not
of
their
existence
and
they
were
the
more
striking
on
this
account
i
was
astonished
at
their
size
and
magnificence
even
from
that
distance
but
how
much
more
so
when
we
approached
them
nearer
we
had
plenty
of
time
before
us
and
i
proposed
if
the
durgah
should
not
be
much
further
to
diverge
from
the
road
and
examine
them
i
rode
up
to
the
driver
of
the
cart
and
asked
him
how
far
we
were
from
the
place
of
our
destination
you
can
not
see
the
durgah
yet
said
the
man
but
it
is
just
behind
the
tombs
on
the
border
of
a
large
tank
you
can
not
miss
it
you
will
see
its
white
dome
and
gilt
spire
above
the
tamarind
trees
which
surround
it
very
good
said
i
do
you
go
on
thither
and
if
you
are
asked
any
questions
say
that
you
belong
to
a
party
which
is
coming
out
from
the
city
we
shall
go
to
the
tombs
and
will
join
you
shortly
the
driver
kept
to
the
road
and
we
diverging
from
it
directed
our
way
to
the
mausoleums
of
the
departed
kings
as
we
approached
them
their
immense
size
and
the
beautiful
groups
which
they
assumed
as
our
point
of
view
shifted
struck
forcibly
on
the
mind
while
the
desolation
around
them
added
to
their
solemn
appearance
what
a
pity
said
peer
khan
who
accompanied
me
that
the
good
people
of
the
city
do
not
make
gardens
about
these
proud
buildings
the
spot
seems
to
be
utterly
neglected
even
as
a
they
are
better
as
they
are
said
i
the
dust
of
the
present
miserable
generation
would
hardly
mix
with
that
of
so
noble
a
one
as
that
which
has
left
such
a
monument
of
its
glory
ay
continued
i
as
we
entered
the
first
immense
tomb
these
were
kings
and
princes
who
lie
here
men
who
won
their
kingdoms
at
the
sword
point
and
kept
them
how
different
to
the
present
degenerate
race
who
are
indebted
for
the
bread
they
eat
to
the
generosity
of
the
feringhees
we
ascended
by
a
narrow
stair
to
the
top
of
the
tomb
and
from
the
terrace
out
of
which
the
huge
dome
proudly
reared
itself
the
view
of
the
city
was
superb
but
it
was
not
equal
to
the
one
i
have
before
described
to
you
for
we
saw
none
of
the
white
buildings
the
mecca
mosque
and
the
char
minar
were
alone
distinguishable
over
the
mass
of
trees
if
i
except
the
innumerable
white
minarets
which
rose
out
from
the
foliage
in
every
direction
from
the
other
side
of
the
terrace
the
whole
of
the
large
tombs
were
seen
at
a
glance
each
by
itself
a
noble
and
striking
object
but
rendered
still
more
so
when
grouped
with
others
of
smaller
size
whose
contrast
increased
their
massiveness
not
a
creature
was
to
be
seen
the
old
fort
itself
its
gray
mouldering
walls
covering
the
face
of
a
huge
pile
of
rocks
seemed
tenantless
and
was
in
unison
with
the
abodes
of
the
illustrious
dead
who
had
built
it
the
silence
and
desolation
were
oppressive
and
we
scarcely
made
a
remark
to
each
other
as
we
traversed
one
by
one
the
interiors
of
the
noble
edifices
some
of
them
dark
and
gloomy
and
filled
with
bats
and
wild
pigeons
whose
cooing
within
the
lofty
domes
and
others
whose
wide
arches
admitted
the
light
of
day
and
were
more
cheerful
in
appearance
enough
said
i
after
we
had
examined
some
of
the
largest
we
do
but
loiter
here
while
we
may
even
now
be
expected
yonder
is
the
durgah
and
we
had
better
go
to
it
and
be
prepared
she
can
not
now
be
long
absent
i
saw
as
we
approached
the
sacred
edifice
that
our
cart
was
ready
but
there
was
no
other
and
my
mind
somewhat
misgave
me
that
azima
had
been
unable
to
keep
her
appointment
and
i
resolved
within
myself
that
should
she
not
arrive
before
noon
i
would
return
to
the
city
and
seek
my
bride
for
such
i
now
considered
her
i
could
not
leave
so
lovely
a
creature
to
the
rude
treatment
she
would
experience
from
him
to
whom
she
was
united
one
who
was
undeserving
to
possess
a
jewel
such
as
she
was
but
it
was
still
early
and
perhaps
some
hours
must
elapse
before
she
could
reach
the
durgah
which
was
further
from
the
city
than
i
had
anticipated
i
entered
the
holy
precincts
and
after
offering
up
a
gift
upon
the
shrine
of
the
saint
i
put
up
a
fervent
prayer
that
the
object
we
had
come
for
should
end
successfully
this
done
i
sat
down
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
entered
into
conversation
with
one
of
the
many
moolas
who
attended
on
the
tomb
and
who
were
constantly
employed
in
reading
the
koran
over
the
grave
of
the
saint
he
asked
me
who
i
was
i
told
him
i
belonged
to
the
city
and
had
brought
my
wife
to
perform
a
vow
to
the
saint
on
her
recovering
from
a
dangerous
illness
but
she
is
not
yet
come
said
i
i
rode
on
with
some
of
my
attendants
and
she
will
follow
and
will
soon
be
here
hour
after
hour
passed
and
yet
azima
did
not
come
sahib
i
was
in
a
torment
of
suspense
and
anxiety
could
she
have
met
with
any
misfortune
could
her
lord
have
returned
home
unexpectedly
could
she
have
played
me
false
ah
not
the
last
her
grief
her
misery
were
too
strong
to
be
feigned
and
what
object
could
she
have
had
in
dissembling
noon
came
and
the
music
of
the
nobut
began
to
play
still
no
signs
of
her
my
patience
was
fairly
exhausted
and
i
went
to
the
place
where
my
horse
stood
mounted
him
and
bidding
the
men
remain
where
they
were
i
rode
on
towards
the
city
i
had
scarcely
got
beyond
the
small
village
by
which
the
durgah
was
surrounded
when
i
saw
three
carts
with
curtains
to
them
carefully
closed
approaching
my
heart
beat
quickly
with
hope
and
i
determined
to
return
one
of
them
surely
is
hers
thought
i
and
i
will
await
her
coming
in
the
durgah
she
comes
cried
i
to
peer
khan
as
he
eagerly
asked
the
cause
of
my
quick
return
she
comes
bid
fazil
have
his
cart
in
readiness
and
take
it
round
to
the
gate
which
leads
towards
puttuncherroo
i
dismounted
and
stood
at
the
gate
the
first
cart
arrived
it
was
filled
with
who
had
a
vow
to
sing
at
the
shrine
one
of
them
having
lost
her
voice
some
time
before
but
had
recovered
it
as
they
supposed
at
the
intercession
of
the
holy
wullee
they
passed
me
and
i
soon
heard
their
voices
singing
one
of
their
melodies
inside
the
tomb
the
second
arrived
three
old
women
got
out
who
were
the
bearers
of
some
trays
of
sweetmeats
for
the
moolas
the
offering
of
some
lady
of
rank
who
was
ill
and
begged
their
prayers
and
intercession
with
the
saint
for
her
recovery
mother
said
i
to
one
of
them
saw
you
aught
of
a
cart
with
three
females
in
it
my
zenana
in
fact
on
the
road
from
the
city
yes
said
the
woman
they
are
close
behind
us
their
vehicle
broke
down
in
a
rivulet
we
had
to
pass
and
is
coming
very
slowly
but
it
will
be
here
directly
and
the
ladies
are
safe
for
i
spoke
to
them
and
offered
to
bring
them
on
but
the
damage
had
been
repaired
somehow
or
other
and
they
declined
my
offer
i
cried
they
are
safe
then
i
have
been
waiting
here
since
morning
and
in
anxiety
enough
about
them
no
wonder
said
the
old
lady
for
the
khanum
seemed
to
be
pale
and
but
mashalla
she
is
beautiful
and
my
lord
too
is
in
every
way
worthy
of
her
she
has
been
ill
said
i
carelessly
and
her
coming
is
in
consequence
of
a
vow
she
made
may
alla
give
her
a
long
life
and
many
children
i
feel
an
involuntary
interest
in
a
pair
whom
he
hath
joined
together
in
every
way
so
fitted
for
each
other
but
i
go
noble
sir
my
companions
await
my
coming
she
also
passed
on
and
in
a
few
moments
more
the
cart
i
so
longed
to
see
turned
the
corner
of
some
projecting
houses
and
advanced
slowly
towards
the
gate
how
my
heart
throbbed
was
it
her
my
life
my
soul
or
was
i
doomed
to
a
third
disappointment
it
stopped
and
i
could
have
fallen
down
and
worshipped
the
old
nurse
who
first
emerged
from
the
vehicle
i
ran
towards
her
but
was
stopped
by
the
driver
it
is
a
zenana
noble
sir
he
said
and
courtesy
requires
you
to
go
out
of
sight
lest
their
faces
should
be
seen
in
descending
peace
fool
the
women
are
my
own
that
alters
the
case
said
the
man
and
my
lord
displeasure
must
not
fall
on
his
slave
for
this
delay
the
axletree
cracked
in
passing
a
rivulet
which
is
a
circumstance
no
foresight
could
have
prevented
seeing
that
it
was
newly
fitted
after
the
mohorum
it
matters
not
said
i
but
you
may
now
leave
us
i
will
return
and
pay
you
your
hire
there
is
an
empty
cart
yonder
which
i
will
engage
for
them
to
return
in
the
fellow
retired
to
a
short
distance
and
my
breath
went
and
came
as
i
put
my
head
into
the
curtains
and
saw
my
beloved
sitting
unveiled
beautiful
beyond
description
and
her
fine
features
glowing
with
the
excitement
of
her
success
shookur
khoda
she
exclaimed
you
are
here
my
own
best
and
dearest
you
have
not
been
unfaithful
to
your
poor
slave
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
imprinted
numberless
kisses
on
her
lips
toba
toba
for
shame
cried
the
old
nurse
can
not
you
refrain
for
a
while
assist
her
to
dismount
and
we
will
go
into
the
durgah
i
did
so
and
closely
enveloped
in
a
boorka
and
leaning
on
the
old
woman
and
nurgiz
azima
followed
me
into
the
inclosure
our
first
care
was
to
offer
up
at
the
shrine
some
money
and
a
few
sweetmeats
which
azima
had
brought
with
her
the
old
moola
to
whom
i
had
before
spoken
received
them
and
laid
them
on
the
tomb
they
are
accepted
said
he
and
whatever
prayers
you
may
offer
up
our
kind
saint
will
intercede
with
the
holy
prophet
for
you
that
they
be
granted
thanks
good
moola
said
i
all
i
desire
is
that
the
pearl
of
my
eyes
may
be
protected
in
health
and
long
spared
to
me
truly
an
anxious
time
have
we
had
of
it
with
her
but
she
is
now
restored
to
health
and
may
alla
grant
it
be
continued
it
will
be
he
replied
our
blessed
saint
prayers
are
wonderfully
efficacious
and
i
could
relate
to
my
lord
many
miracles
which
have
been
performed
here
no
doubt
said
i
the
fame
of
hoosain
shah
wullee
is
spread
far
and
wide
and
we
of
the
city
have
reason
to
be
thankful
that
such
blessed
saints
were
led
in
days
of
old
to
take
up
their
residence
near
it
for
our
present
generation
is
so
degraded
that
without
the
aid
of
his
prayers
the
displeasure
of
the
supreme
one
would
fall
heavily
on
us
my
lord
words
have
a
sweet
and
holy
savour
said
the
moola
and
show
that
though
his
bearing
is
that
of
a
soldier
his
heart
is
filled
with
religion
and
blessed
is
he
in
whom
both
are
seen
united
but
i
could
tell
my
lord
of
many
of
the
saint
miracles
if
he
has
leisure
to
hear
them
and
as
he
will
not
return
till
the
afternoon
we
can
sit
down
under
the
trees
and
i
will
relate
them
excuse
me
good
moola
said
i
time
presses
and
i
have
promised
the
syudanee
mother
that
i
will
return
before
the
cold
of
evening
sets
in
and
it
is
now
past
noon
as
you
will
said
he
yet
perhaps
these
few
pages
which
i
have
compiled
during
my
leisure
hours
may
entertain
as
well
as
instruct
if
my
lord
will
accept
them
of
course
he
can
read
persian
indifferently
well
said
i
we
soldiers
are
rarely
good
scholars
nevertheless
i
will
keep
the
book
and
here
is
a
trifle
which
may
prove
acceptable
and
i
put
an
ashruffee
into
his
hand
the
old
man
eyes
glistened
as
he
saw
it
and
after
a
profusion
of
compliments
he
left
us
to
ourselves
now
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
said
old
kulloo
we
must
travel
far
and
fast
this
day
you
have
brought
a
cart
with
you
i
have
it
is
ready
if
there
be
aught
in
the
one
you
came
in
tell
me
and
i
will
have
it
put
into
the
other
send
a
man
or
two
with
us
said
the
nurse
i
and
nurgiz
will
arrange
the
new
vehicle
and
return
instantly
they
too
left
us
and
we
were
alone
no
one
remained
in
the
large
inclosure
the
women
were
still
singing
in
the
tomb
and
all
the
moolas
were
sitting
round
them
listening
can
you
support
the
fatigue
of
further
travel
azima
said
i
i
am
strong
and
can
bear
anything
so
i
am
with
thee
and
thou
with
me
she
replied
dearest
i
am
now
secure
but
oh
the
suspense
i
have
endured
since
i
last
saw
you
and
until
i
was
fairly
out
of
that
vile
city
tell
me
said
i
how
did
you
contrive
to
elude
suspicion
when
you
left
us
replied
azima
i
thought
my
happiness
had
fled
for
ever
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
called
you
back
and
to
have
fled
with
you
then
i
had
seen
your
noble
face
i
had
heard
your
vows
of
love
alla
had
sent
me
a
lover
such
as
my
warmest
fancy
had
painted
to
me
while
i
was
daily
suffering
torments
which
the
fond
and
loving
only
can
feel
when
their
affection
is
returned
by
severe
and
bitter
insult
and
i
thought
i
had
lost
him
that
i
had
only
gained
a
few
moments
of
bliss
which
would
appear
like
one
of
those
dreams
that
had
often
cheated
my
sleeping
fancy
to
leave
me
when
i
awoke
to
the
bitter
realities
of
my
sad
lot
and
i
was
inconsolable
but
my
kind
old
nurse
and
nurgiz
soothed
me
they
told
me
they
would
die
for
me
and
assured
me
you
would
be
faithful
so
i
gathered
courage
and
kulloo
proposed
that
we
should
make
immediate
preparations
for
flight
we
packed
up
some
clothes
and
my
jewels
and
all
the
money
which
had
been
left
with
us
a
few
hundred
rupees
and
before
morning
we
lay
down
to
take
a
little
sleep
at
daylight
kulloo
told
the
other
slaves
and
the
two
old
servants
that
i
was
going
to
this
durgah
and
sent
one
of
them
for
a
cart
it
came
about
sunrise
and
concealing
the
articles
we
had
packed
up
in
two
large
bundles
of
carpets
and
sheets
which
we
said
we
should
require
to
sit
on
at
the
durgah
we
put
them
into
the
cart
got
in
ourselves
and
the
driver
made
the
best
of
his
way
hither
she
had
just
spoken
when
kulloo
came
to
us
all
is
prepared
said
she
i
have
dismissed
the
other
cart
and
your
new
one
is
now
ready
do
not
delay
there
was
no
occasion
for
her
to
hurry
us
we
were
as
well
inclined
to
set
off
as
she
was
and
we
rose
and
followed
her
the
cart
was
ready
my
men
with
it
and
nurgiz
already
inside
azima
got
in
and
her
old
nurse
followed
you
too
cried
i
yes
meer
sahib
my
home
is
at
beeder
whither
i
will
accompany
you
the
city
is
no
longer
safe
for
me
my
life
would
be
forfeited
were
i
ever
to
enter
it
again
and
fall
in
with
that
prince
of
devils
nusrut
ali
khan
whose
house
is
now
dishonoured
and
whose
beard
we
have
spat
upon
drive
on
i
exclaimed
to
fazil
go
as
fast
as
you
can
we
must
reach
puttuncherroo
before
nightfall
the
road
from
the
durgah
after
passing
the
tank
upon
which
it
was
situated
led
through
a
wild
pass
piles
of
rocks
frowned
over
us
and
the
road
was
at
times
so
narrow
that
the
cart
could
scarcely
proceed
a
rare
place
for
a
little
work
said
i
to
peer
khan
as
we
reached
a
low
thrown
across
the
road
and
pierced
with
holes
for
musketry
many
a
wild
deed
has
been
done
here
in
times
past
warrant
they
tell
queer
stories
of
the
place
he
replied
and
we
have
used
it
ourselves
in
some
of
our
late
expeditions
from
the
city
there
lie
the
seven
bunneas
you
heard
of
and
he
pointed
out
a
remarkable
rock
not
far
from
the
road
a
sad
business
we
had
with
the
grave
it
was
all
rock
underneath
and
the
bodies
were
hardly
covered
but
who
asks
about
them
in
this
country
why
as
we
accompanied
the
travellers
we
saw
lying
in
this
very
pass
the
bodies
of
two
men
who
had
been
murdered
and
dreadfully
mangled
well
said
i
we
have
left
our
marks
behind
us
at
any
rate
and
all
things
considered
we
have
been
lucky
it
matters
not
if
we
get
no
more
bunij
all
the
way
to
hindostan
we
have
enough
to
make
us
comfortable
for
some
years
said
he
nevertheless
one
hand
gets
out
of
practice
and
you
are
but
young
at
the
work
the
more
you
have
for
a
few
years
to
come
the
better
we
reached
puttuncherroo
late
in
the
evening
and
to
my
inexpressible
joy
found
my
father
and
the
whole
band
safely
arrived
and
comfortably
encamped
under
a
large
banian
tree
by
which
was
a
fakeer
tomb
one
of
our
small
tents
had
been
pitched
for
azima
and
after
seeing
her
settled
for
the
night
i
joined
my
father
you
are
a
lucky
fellow
said
he
when
i
had
told
him
of
all
my
success
i
have
been
in
anxious
suspense
about
you
especially
when
the
evening
set
in
and
you
came
not
but
now
there
is
no
danger
we
are
once
again
in
the
country
and
the
roads
are
our
own
and
now
tell
me
what
is
your
new
bride
like
is
she
as
handsome
as
zora
she
is
quite
as
handsome
said
i
the
full
moon
is
not
more
beautiful
she
is
tender
in
her
love
and
of
an
affectionate
and
kind
disposition
you
must
see
her
she
is
now
fatigued
with
travel
and
you
must
be
fatigued
also
my
son
and
hungry
too
i
have
a
rare
pilau
ready
for
you
it
was
brought
and
after
sending
a
portion
to
azima
my
fingers
were
very
soon
busied
with
the
rest
of
the
contents
of
the
dish
and
i
enjoyed
it
for
i
had
tasted
nothing
but
a
few
of
the
sweetmeats
azima
had
brought
with
her
during
the
whole
day
chapter
xxii
on
the
fourth
morning
we
reached
beeder
if
not
so
striking
in
its
outward
appearance
as
we
approached
it
as
hyderabad
this
city
was
nevertheless
interesting
the
summit
of
a
long
tableland
broke
into
a
gentle
descent
and
from
it
beeder
suddenly
opened
on
our
view
the
walls
of
the
town
occupied
the
crest
of
a
high
ridge
and
over
them
one
tall
minaret
and
what
appeared
another
rude
unfinished
one
of
great
height
towered
proudly
on
the
right
hand
the
large
white
domes
of
some
tombs
peeped
out
of
a
grove
of
mango
trees
with
which
the
hill
was
clothed
from
top
to
bottom
and
there
was
a
quiet
solemnity
about
the
approach
to
the
now
nearly
deserted
capital
of
dukhun
the
favourite
residence
of
the
once
proud
and
powerful
bhamunee
kings
which
accorded
well
with
our
feelings
and
formed
a
powerful
contrast
to
the
busy
city
we
had
just
left
some
of
our
men
who
had
gone
on
in
advance
had
chosen
a
spot
for
our
encampment
near
the
gate
of
the
city
upon
the
road
we
were
to
take
in
the
morning
but
separating
from
my
party
i
rode
through
the
town
which
though
now
mean
in
comparison
to
what
it
must
have
been
was
more
striking
than
i
had
expected
to
find
it
i
joined
the
encampment
on
the
other
side
which
now
presented
its
usual
bustling
appearance
some
were
already
cooking
their
morning
meal
by
the
edge
of
the
well
others
were
bathing
and
all
talking
and
conversing
in
that
joyous
manner
which
showed
their
minds
were
free
from
care
and
full
of
happiness
at
the
prospect
of
a
speedier
return
to
their
home
than
they
had
anticipated
and
well
laden
with
a
rich
booty
my
father
this
is
a
city
full
of
true
believers
said
i
as
i
joined
him
moolas
there
must
be
in
plenty
and
i
pray
you
to
send
for
one
that
the
nika
may
be
performed
and
that
i
may
receive
azima
at
your
hands
as
my
wife
i
will
not
oppose
it
my
son
but
the
old
moola
whoever
he
may
be
will
think
it
strange
he
may
think
what
he
pleases
said
i
but
i
can
no
longer
live
without
her
therefore
pray
consider
the
point
settled
and
send
for
him
at
once
accordingly
peer
khan
was
despatched
for
the
holy
person
who
duly
arrived
he
was
received
with
the
greatest
courtesy
by
my
father
and
the
object
for
which
he
was
required
was
explained
to
him
he
expressed
the
utmost
astonishment
it
was
a
proceeding
he
had
never
heard
of
for
persons
to
celebrate
a
marriage
on
a
journey
and
was
in
every
respect
improper
and
indelicate
when
he
had
exhausted
his
protestations
my
father
replied
to
him
look
you
good
moola
said
he
there
is
no
one
who
pays
more
respect
to
the
forms
and
usages
of
our
holy
faith
than
i
do
am
i
not
a
syud
of
hindostan
do
i
not
say
the
namaz
five
times
a
day
fast
in
the
ramzan
and
keep
every
festival
enjoined
by
the
law
and
unwilling
as
i
am
to
do
anything
which
may
be
thought
a
breach
of
the
rules
of
our
faith
yet
circumstances
which
i
can
not
explain
render
it
imperative
that
this
ceremony
should
be
performed
and
if
you
refuse
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
is
no
want
of
moolas
in
beeder
and
if
you
do
not
perform
it
some
less
scrupulous
person
must
and
earn
the
reward
which
i
now
offer
to
you
and
my
father
laid
two
ashrufees
before
him
that
alters
the
case
materially
said
the
moola
pocketing
the
money
since
the
ceremony
must
be
performed
in
alla
name
let
it
take
place
it
was
no
doubt
fated
that
it
should
be
so
and
you
will
therefore
find
no
person
in
beeder
more
willing
to
read
the
form
of
the
nika
than
myself
let
me
i
pray
you
return
for
my
book
i
will
be
back
instantly
and
he
departed
there
cried
my
father
i
thought
it
would
be
so
no
one
can
withstand
the
sight
of
gold
from
the
prince
on
the
throne
to
the
meanest
peasant
it
is
the
same
its
influence
is
with
it
a
man
may
purchase
his
neighbour
conscience
his
neighbour
wife
or
his
daughter
with
it
a

rules

as

alla
ke
qoodrut
said
i
with
a
sigh
your
words
are
true
my
father
now
that
one
thinks
on
them
and
we
have
had
a
precious
specimen
in
the
sudden
change
of
opinion
in
the
worthy
moola
who
asked
no
further
questions
when
he
saw
your
gold
no
cried
my
father
and
if
one
only
had
enough
one
might
rule
the
world
who
was
sikundur
by
all
accounts
a
petty
prince
not
half
so
powerful
as
he
who
rules
this
country
and
yet
when
he
gained
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
jins
and
afterwards
by
his
magic
got
dominion
over
them
did
they
not
place
the
treasures
heaped
up
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
at
his
disposal
and
who
could
then
stop
his
career
is
not
this
all
written
in
a
book
and
is
it
not
as
true
as
the
koran
it
were
heresy
to
doubt
it
said
i
but
here
comes
the
subject
of
our
conversation
with
his
book
under
his
arm
i
will
prepare
azima
i
went
to
her
dearest
cried
i
seating
myself
and
passing
my
arm
round
her
waist
dearest
the
time
is
come
when
with
the
blessing
of
alla
and
my
father
sanction
you
will
be
mine
for
ever
and
when
the
law
shall
bind
us
together
for
death
alone
to
separate
us
a
moola
has
come
and
with
your
permission
now
even
now
the
nika
shall
be
performed
further
delay
is
idle
and
i
am
consumed
with
the
burnings
of
my
love
so
soon
ameer
ali
oh
not
till
we
reach
your
home
what
will
your
father
think
of
my
consenting
to
this
wild
union
he
sanctions
it
beloved
was
he
who
sent
for
the
moola
was
he
who
persuaded
him
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
they
but
await
my
return
to
the
tent
to
read
the
words
which
make
you
mine
for
ever
alas
i
know
not
said
the
fair
girl
i
am
another
wife
how
can
this
be
done
forget
the
hateful
marriage
i
cried
azima
these
objections
will
kill
me
am
i
not
your
slave
are
we
not
now
on
our
way
to
a
distant
land
where
he
from
whom
you
have
fled
will
never
again
hear
of
you
ah
do
not
continue
to
talk
thus
for
it
seems
like
a
bitter
mockery
that
you
should
have
fled
with
me
now
to
deny
yourself
to
me
no
no
no
do
not
say
so
ameer
ali
you
saved
me
from
insult
and
from
a
miserable
death
to
which
i
had
doomed
myself
i
am
your
slave
not
you
mine
do
as
you
choose
with
me
let
it
be
even
as
you
will
i
will
follow
you
till
death
and
she
hid
her
face
in
my
bosom
then
cried
i
beloved
the
preparations
are
soon
made
call
kulloo
and
let
her
know
all
the
old
woman
came
and
was
overjoyed
to
hear
of
my
proposal
i
had
feared
you
would
not
have
bound
yourself
by
this
tie
meer
sahib
said
she
and
my
mind
sorely
troubled
me
on
the
subject
but
now
i
am
easy
and
i
will
give
my
precious
child
to
you
with
joy
and
confidence
may
you
be
blessed
in
her
and
see
your
children
children
would
that
i
could
proceed
with
you
but
i
am
old
and
my
bones
and
spirit
would
not
rest
easily
in
a
strange
land
your
generosity
and
what
i
have
scraped
together
is
enough
to
make
me
comfortable
for
life
and
when
my
hour
comes
i
shall
die
content
then
be
quick
said
i
put
up
a
screen
and
i
will
call
the
moola
you
can
all
three
of
you
sit
behind
it
while
the
ceremony
is
read
a
cloth
was
stretched
from
one
side
of
the
tent
to
the
other
and
fastened
to
the
ground
my
father
myself
and
the
moola
sat
on
one
side
the
females
on
the
other
all
is
ready
moolajee
said
i
begin
he
opened
his
book
and
read
the
usual
service
in
arabic
i
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
neither
indeed
did
he
but
it
was
sufficient
that
it
had
been
read
the
ceremony
was
complete
and
azima
was
mine
for
ever
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
have
left
beeder
without
seeing
more
of
the
town
and
fort
of
which
i
had
heard
many
praises
and
in
the
evening
therefore
my
father
myself
and
a
few
others
strolled
into
the
town
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
what
we
could
first
we
passed
the
old
madressa
a
noble
mass
of
ruins
the
front
was
covered
with
beautiful
enamel
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
immense
minaret
which
we
had
seen
from
a
distance
in
the
morning
was
also
covered
with
the
same
the
huge
round
fragments
of
another
lay
scattered
about
in
every
direction
and
i
could
well
picture
to
myself
the
noble
building
it
must
have
been
ere
by
an
unfortunate
explosion
of
gunpowder
when
used
as
a
magazine
by
aurungzebe
its
front
was
blown
out
one
minaret
destroyed
and
the
whole
rent
and
torn
as
if
by
an
earthquake
passing
onwards
we
arrived
at
an
open
space
before
the
ancient
and
majestic
ruins
of
the
fort
piles
upon
piles
of
old
ruined
palaces
in
many
places
built
upon
the
walls
themselves
and
all
nodding
to
their
fall
while
they
impressed
us
with
a
stronger
idea
of
the
magnificence
of
their
builders
than
anything
we
had
as
yet
seen
were
a
lesson
to
humble
proud
man
to
teach
him
that
he
too
must
moulder
in
the
dust
as
their
founders
had
done
they
had
stood
for
centuries
yet
now
the
owl
the
bat
and
the
wild
pigeon
were
the
only
tenants
of
these
splendid
halls
where
once
beauty
had
dwelt
and
had
been
the
adoration
of
the
brave
and
glorious
where
were
now
the
princely
state
the
pomp
of
royalty
the
gallant
warriors
who
had
of
old
manned
these
lofty
walls
and
towers
and
so
oft
bidden
defiance
to
hosts
of
invaders
all
were
gone
all
was
now
lonely
and
desolate
and
the
stillness
accorded
well
with
the
ruinous
appearance
of
the
scene
before
us
not
however
that
the
walls
were
dilapidated
or
overthrown
remained
as
firm
and
solid
as
ever
and
here
and
there
the
muzzle
of
a
cannon
pointing
from
a
loophole
or
rude
embrasure
showed
that
they
were
still
capable
of
defence
though
alas
defenders
there
were
none
we
thought
the
place
absolutely
deserted
and
went
on
to
the
gateway
it
was
massive
and
highly
ornamented
with
enamel
work
such
as
we
had
seen
before
in
the
old
madressa
and
the
tombs
at
golconda
while
we
thus
stood
admiring
the
outside
a
soldier
approached
us
and
asked
us
our
business
we
are
strangers
who
have
put
up
in
the
town
for
the
day
answered
my
father
and
we
could
not
leave
the
spot
without
looking
at
the
venerable
fort
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
may
we
be
permitted
to
enter
certainly
he
replied
persons
of
your
respectable
appearance
are
always
gladly
admitted
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
show
you
over
the
interior
which
is
worthy
your
inspection
we
followed
him
and
passing
through
two
gateways
which
were
defended
by
traverses
so
as
to
be
impenetrable
to
invaders
we
stopped
under
the
third
and
our
conductor
said
the
rooms
above
this
are
well
worth
seeing
if
you
will
ascend
surely
said
i
we
would
willingly
see
everything
we
ascended
a
narrow
stair
which
at
the
top
opened
into
a
small
but
beautiful
suite
of
rooms
profusely
adorned
with
enamel
far
surpassing
in
its
brilliancy
of
colours
and
minuteness
of
design
any
that
we
had
before
seen
on
the
outside
sentences
of
the
koran
in
white
letters
on
a
brilliant
azure
ground
were
all
round
the
cornices
and
the
ceilings
and
walls
were
covered
with
flowers
of
every
hue
and
design
their
colours
and
the
enamel
in
which
they
were
worked
being
as
fresh
and
bright
as
the
day
they
were
first
painted
these
are
imperishable
said
i
to
my
father
would
that
the
buildings
which
hold
them
could
be
so
too
to
remain
to
generations
yet
unborn
a
proof
of
the
magnificence
and
wealth
to
which
they
owed
their
erection
ay
said
he
there
requires
no
better
proof
than
these
of
the
present
degeneracy
the
monarchs
of
those
times
were
just
and
liberal
as
well
as
powerful
the
wealth
their
dominions
brought
them
was
freely
expended
in
beautifying
their
cities
and
raising
edifices
by
which
they
might
be
remembered
now
with
the
same
dominions
the
wealth
they
bring
is
either
uselessly
hoarded
or
wastefully
expended
now
no
buildings
arise
as
monuments
of
a
dynasty
no
armies
rejoice
in
the
presence
of
a
brave
and
noble
sovereign
and
stimulated
by
his
example
win
for
him
renown
at
the
points
of
their
bright
swords
all
now
is
mean
and
sordid
from
the
poor
pensioned
descendant
of
shah
jhan
and
alumgeer
to
the
representative
of
the
once
proud
soobahs
of
the
dukhun
yes
said
our
conductor
what
is
the
use
of
now
calling
oneself
a
soldier
with
scarcely
bread
to
eat
the
few
of
us
who
are
in
the
fort
wander
about
the
ruins
of
the
noble
palaces
and
the
deserted
walls
and
our
only
enemies
are
the
panthers
and
hyænas
who
have
taken
advantage
of
the
yearly
increasing
jungle
and
desolation
and
bid
fair
to
expel
us
altogether
but
look
from
the
window
sirs
the
open
ground
over
which
you
came
is
called
the
fatteh
mydan
the
plain
of
victory
here
the
proud
monarchs
of
beeder
first
the
bhamunee
and
afterwards
the
beereed
dynasties
used
to
sit
while
their
gallant
troops
poured
forth
from
the
gates
and
amused
while
they
gratified
their
sovereign
with
feats
of
arms
and
yonder
added
he
taking
us
to
another
window
yonder
are
their
tombs
where
their
mortal
remains
rest
though
their
spirits
are
in
the
blessed
paradise
of
our
prophet
we
looked
and
the
view
was
as
lovely
as
it
was
unexpected
we
were
on
the
top
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
lofty
mountain
so
far
and
so
deep
did
the
noble
expanse
of
valley
before
us
descend
the
blue
distance
melted
into
the
blue
of
the
heavens
while
nearer
and
nearer
to
us
the
villages
and
fields
became
more
and
more
distinct
till
close
under
us
they
seemed
as
it
were
drawn
out
on
a
map
and
among
them
stood
the
tombs
a
cluster
of
edifices
their
white
domes
glaring
in
the
red
light
of
the
declining
sun
ay
cried
i
they
must
have
felt
that
they
were
kings
while
they
gazed
admiringly
on
their
gallant
soldiers
and
looked
forth
over
the
lovely
country
which
they
ruled
come
said
my
father
breaking
in
upon
my
reflections
which
were
rapidly
peopling
the
open
space
of
the
fatteh
mydan
with
the
troops
and
warriors
of
past
ages
and
picturing
to
me
their
manly
games
their
the
shouts
of
the
contending
parties
while
from
the
spot
whereon
i
stood
the
praises
of
the
king
and
acclamations
of
his
courtiers
were
ringing
through
the
arched
roofs
and
by
the
multitudes
without
come
it
is
growing
late
and
we
must
soon
return
we
again
followed
our
guide
and
as
we
passed
over
a
causeway
which
was
built
across
the
moat
we
had
a
noble
view
of
its
great
width
and
depth
the
bottom
was
partially
covered
by
stagnant
pools
the
remains
of
the
water
the
monsoon
had
deposited
for
the
rainy
season
was
now
past
the
fosse
was
very
curiously
dug
with
a
view
to
defence
having
been
excavated
out
of
the
solid
rock
to
a
considerable
depth
three
walls
had
been
left
standing
with
large
intervals
between
each
and
they
would
certainly
oppose
a
most
formidable
interruption
to
an
invader
we
entered
the
fort
by
a
large
gloomy
archway
within
which
some
soldiers
were
lounging
and
from
thence
traversing
a
large
covered
with
fragments
of
ruins
and
rank
brushwood
we
emerged
into
an
open
space
beyond
here
a
scene
of
still
greater
desolation
than
even
the
outside
presented
opened
on
our
view
ruins
of
all
descriptions
of
palaces
stables
offices
baths
magazines
for
arms
and
ammunition
strewed
the
ground
it
was
a
melancholy
sight
but
the
whole
was
evidently
far
beyond
repair
and
fast
hastening
to
destruction
we
left
the
spot
to
see
the
only
remaining
real
curiosity
of
the
place
an
immense
cannon
the
as
our
guide
told
us
of
one
at
beejapoor
it
was
on
a
high
bastion
from
which
there
was
a
magnificent
view
of
the
plain
below
us
over
which
the
huge
fort
now
flung
its
broad
deep
shadow
while
the
distant
country
was
fast
fading
into
obscurity
under
the
growing
darkness
of
the
evening
the
herds
of
the
town
winding
up
the
steep
ascent
from
the
plain
alone
broke
the
impressive
silence
as
their
lowings
the
tinkling
of
their
numberless
bells
and
the
melancholy
yet
sweet
notes
of
the
shepherd
rude
pipe
ascended
to
our
lofty
station
but
we
could
stay
no
longer
we
returned
by
the
way
we
had
come
and
though
i
longed
to
have
roamed
over
the
ruined
and
deserted
palaces
and
explored
their
recesses
it
was
too
late
dismissing
our
guide
therefore
with
a
small
present
for
his
civility
we
retraced
our
steps
to
our
encampment
from
beeder
sahib
we
had
no
adventures
worth
relating
till
we
reached
ellichpoor
by
which
town
we
directed
our
route
homewards
however
we
did
not
travel
by
the
same
road
as
we
had
done
in
coming
down
which
would
have
led
us
by
mungrool
and
oomraotee
and
we
had
good
reasons
for
avoiding
both
places
the
remembrance
of
the
fate
of
the
sahoukar
would
necessarily
be
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
latter
place
and
our
appearance
was
too
remarkable
to
be
easily
forgotten
so
we
struck
off
from
nandair
on
the
godavery
towards
boorhanpoor
and
when
we
reached
akola
in
the
berar
valley
we
turned
again
towards
ellichpoor
and
reached
it
in
safety
you
must
not
think
however
that
during
this
long
journey
we
were
idle
on
the
contrary
we
pursued
our
avocation
with
the
same
spirit
and
success
with
which
we
had
commenced
and
continued
our
fortunate
expedition
and
no
traveller
however
humble
who
joined
our
party
or
was
decoyed
among
us
escaped
and
by
this
means
though
our
booty
was
not
materially
increased
yet
we
collected
sufficient
to
support
us
without
taking
aught
from
the
general
stock
which
was
to
be
divided
when
we
reached
our
home
at
ellichpoor
we
encamped
under
some
large
tamarind
trees
close
to
the
durgah
of
rhyman
shah
doolah
it
was
a
quiet
lovely
spot
below
the
durgah
ran
a
small
river
which
had
its
rise
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
and
over
its
stream
the
hallowed
buildings
of
the
saint
embowered
in
thick
trees
seemed
to
be
the
abode
of
peace
and
repose
thither
azima
and
myself
attended
by
some
of
our
men
went
as
soon
as
we
had
rested
ourselves
a
little
and
changed
our
garments
to
present
our
offerings
at
the
shrine
and
to
offer
up
our
thanksgivings
for
the
continued
care
and
protection
of
alla
this
done
i
sent
her
back
to
our
camp
and
entered
into
general
conversation
with
the
moolas
as
was
my
wont
in
order
to
gather
information
to
guide
us
in
our
enterprises
and
from
so
large
a
city
as
ellichpoor
i
had
some
hope
that
we
should
gain
a
valuable
booty
we
conversed
upon
many
topics
of
occurrence
at
last
one
of
the
moolas
asked
me
where
i
had
come
from
and
whither
i
was
going
i
said
i
was
a
who
had
been
down
to
hyderabad
with
horses
from
hindostan
and
was
now
returning
having
disposed
of
them
and
the
men
who
accompany
you
who
are
they
asked
the
moola
my
father
who
is
a
merchant
is
one
said
i
besides
him
there
are
the
grooms
and
attendants
who
accompanied
us
and
several
travellers
who
have
joined
us
from
time
to
time
as
we
journeyed
hither
then
you
are
a
kafila
said
the
moola
exactly
so
said
i
and
feeling
ourselves
to
be
strong
we
are
determined
to
try
the
road
to
jubbulpoor
by
baitool
which
though
unsafe
for
small
bodies
presents
no
obstacle
to
our
numerous
party
certainly
not
he
replied
and
the
road
will
save
you
a
long
distance
which
you
would
have
had
to
travel
had
you
gone
round
by
nagpoor
and
since
you
are
bent
on
trying
the
jungle
road
perhaps
you
would
not
have
any
objection
to
an
increase
to
your
party
and
i
think
i
could
get
you
one
certainly
not
said
i
if
the
travellers
are
respectable
highly
so
said
the
moola
the
person
of
whom
i
speak
is
a
man
of
rank
no
less
than
a
nuwab
who
is
returning
to
his
nephew
who
rules
over
bhopal
ah
i
have
heard
of
him
i
think
said
i
you
do
not
mean
the
nuwab
subzee
khan
as
he
is
called
the
very
person
and
a
fine
old
soldier
he
is
it
is
a
pity
he
is
so
addicted
to
the
subzee
or
bhang
from
which
however
he
has
gained
a
name
which
it
is
well
known
has
struck
terror
into
his
enemies
on
the
and
has
fairly
superseded
any
other
he
may
have
had
it
is
a
pity
i
said
for
report
speaks
well
of
the
noble
khan
and
his
deeds
of
arms
are
known
to
all
who
have
sojourned
in
hindostan
i
shall
be
right
glad
to
accompany
him
for
is
said
also
that
he
is
a
rare
companion
you
have
heard
rightly
said
the
moola
the
nuwab
will
be
here
before
sunset
as
he
always
comes
to
converse
with
us
and
drink
his
bhang
if
you
will
step
over
from
your
encampment
when
i
send
to
you
i
will
introduce
you
to
him
thanks
worthy
moola
said
i
you
only
need
to
summon
me
and
i
will
attend
your
call
with
pleasure
i
left
him
soon
after
here
was
the
commencement
of
an
adventure
which
promised
fairly
to
eclipse
all
our
former
ones
the
rank
of
the
nuwab
the
number
of
followers
he
would
necessarily
have
with
him
and
the
noise
there
would
be
made
about
him
when
he
was
missed
all
contributed
to
render
this
as
pretty
an
adventure
as
a
thug
seeking
plunder
and
fame
could
desire
i
did
not
mention
a
word
of
my
hopes
to
any
one
i
was
determined
to
have
this
matter
all
to
myself
both
in
plan
and
execution
if
i
succeeded
my
fame
and
character
were
established
for
ever
and
i
could
not
fail
with
so
many
to
back
me
a
momentary
thought
flashed
across
me
that
the
nuwab
was
a
man
of
war
that
he
would
be
armed
to
the
teeth
and
who
was
i
that
i
could
oppose
him
but
i
dismissed
it
in
an
instant
as
unworthy
my
confidence
in
my
own
prowess
both
as
a
thug
and
with
every
weapon
whether
on
foot
or
on
horseback
was
unbounded
it
had
never
as
yet
been
checked
and
i
feared
nothing
living
i
believe
in
the
form
of
man
yes
ameer
ali
said
i
you
and
all
your
tribe
have
ever
feared
us
englishmen
you
have
never
yet
attacked
one
of
us
nor
dared
you
the
thug
no
sahib
you
are
wrong
we
never
feared
you
but
to
attack
any
of
you
would
have
been
impossible
when
you
travel
on
horseback
you
are
not
worth
attacking
for
you
never
carry
anything
about
your
persons
in
your
tents
you
are
surrounded
by
a
host
of
servants
and
at
night
you
are
always
guarded
when
you
travel
post
we
might
possibly
get
a
few
rupees
from
your
palankeens
but
you
are
generally
armed
you
usually
carry
pistols
and
some
of
us
must
undoubtedly
fall
before
we
could
effect
our
object
but
above
all
there
would
be
such
a
hue
and
cry
if
any
of
you
were
missing
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
escape
especially
as
any
property
we
might
take
from
you
would
assuredly
lead
to
our
detection
your
reasons
are
weighty
said
i
laughing
but
i
suspect
ameer
ali
you
do
not
like
the
pistols
and
that
is
the
reason
we
have
escaped
you
but
go
on
with
your
story
i
have
interrupted
you
well
then
sahib
to
continue
i
waited
very
impatiently
till
towards
evening
when
as
i
was
sitting
at
the
door
of
my
tent
i
saw
a
man
on
horseback
attended
by
a
small
retinue
among
whom
to
my
great
astonishment
was
a
young
girl
mounted
on
a
spirited
pony
coming
down
the
road
from
the
city
he
passed
near
our
camp
and
crossing
the
river
ascended
the
opposite
bank
and
entered
the
durgah
was
this
my
new
victim
i
was
not
long
in
suspense
a
message
soon
came
from
the
moola
requesting
my
company
and
taking
my
sword
and
shield
with
me
i
followed
the
man
who
had
come
to
call
me
chapter
xxiii
seated
with
the
old
moola
i
have
before
mentioned
the
nuwab
subzee
khan
buhadoor
for
by
that
name
alone
i
knew
him
was
quaffing
his
bitter
and
intoxicating
draught
around
him
stood
some
of
his
retainers
fellows
one
or
two
of
them
with
deep
scars
on
their
rough
visages
which
showed
they
had
bravely
followed
their
noble
master
through
many
a
field
behind
him
sat
the
slave
i
have
mentioned
a
slender
fair
girl
who
was
busily
employed
in
making
a
fresh
bowl
of
the
infusion
the
nuwab
was
so
fond
of
the
moola
introduced
me
this
said
he
my
lord
is
the
young
man
i
spoke
of
i
need
repeat
no
praises
of
him
for
no
doubt
your
discerning
eyes
will
at
once
observe
that
he
is
a
person
of
respectability
and
good
breeding
and
a
fit
companion
for
one
of
my
lord
exalted
rank
i
presented
the
hilt
of
my
sword
as
a
nuzzur
and
after
touching
it
with
his
hand
he
bid
me
be
seated
near
him
on
the
carpet
this
i
was
too
polite
to
do
so
excusing
myself
on
the
ground
of
unworthiness
of
such
honour
i
seated
myself
on
my
heels
on
the
edge
of
the
carpet
and
placed
my
sword
and
shield
before
me
the
sword
immediately
attracted
his
attention
that
is
a
noble
weapon
meer
sahib
said
he
may
i
be
allowed
to
look
at
it
certainly
said
i
presenting
the
hilt
the
sword
is
at
my
service
nay
meer
sahib
i
want
it
not
but
i
am
curious
in
these
matters
and
have
a
choice
collection
which
i
will
one
day
show
you
he
drew
it
carefully
from
the
scabbard
and
as
the
blade
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
he
looked
on
it
with
a
smile
of
delight
such
as
one
would
greet
an
intimate
friend
with
after
a
long
absence
i
must
however
describe
him
in
person
he
was
tall
and
strongly
made
his
arms
in
particular
which
were
distinctly
seen
through
his
thin
muslin
dress
were
remarkably
muscular
and
very
long
his
figure
was
slightly
inclined
to
corpulency
perhaps
the
effect
of
age
which
had
also
sprinkled
his
curling
beard
and
mustachios
with
gray
hairs
or
it
might
be
that
these
had
been
increased
in
number
by
the
dangerous
use
of
the
drug
he
drank
in
such
quantities
his
face
was
strikingly
handsome
and
at
once
bespoke
his
high
birth
a
noble
forehead
which
was
but
little
concealed
by
his
turban
was
covered
with
veins
which
rose
above
its
surface
as
though
the
proud
blood
which
flowed
in
them
almost
scorned
confinement
his
eyes
were
large
and
piercing
like
an
eagle
and
but
that
they
were
swollen
and
reddened
by
habitual
intemperance
would
have
been
pronounced
beautiful
he
had
a
prominent
thin
nose
large
nostrils
almost
transparent
and
a
mouth
small
and
curved
like
a
bow
which
when
the
features
were
at
rest
wore
an
habitual
expression
of
scorn
his
flowing
and
graceful
beard
and
mustachios
which
i
have
already
mentioned
completed
a
countenance
such
as
i
had
never
seen
the
like
of
before
and
have
not
met
with
since
the
whole
was
inexpressibly
striking
and
in
the
meanest
apparel
the
nuwab
would
at
once
have
been
pronounced
by
any
one
to
be
a
man
of
high
family
and
a
gallant
soldier
a
rosary
of
large
pearls
was
about
his
neck
and
with
this
exception
he
wore
no
ornaments
his
dress
was
studiously
plain
while
it
was
neat
in
the
extreme
i
remarked
two
deep
scars
one
on
the
back
of
his
head
where
it
joined
the
neck
the
other
on
his
broad
chest
and
its
deep
seam
was
not
concealed
by
the
thin
dress
he
wore
such
was
subzee
khan
who
had
won
his
renown
in
many
a
hard
fight
and
whom
i
was
determined
to
destroy
on
the
very
first
opportunity
he
continued
looking
at
the
blade
so
earnestly
and
so
long
that
i
began
to
think
that
it
had
possibly
belonged
to
some
victim
of
my
father
who
might
have
been
known
to
the
nuwab
and
i
was
mentally
framing
a
reply
in
case
he
should
ask
me
where
i
got
it
when
he
suddenly
said
as
he
passed
his
finger
along
the
edge
so
you
too
have
seen
battles
my
friend
there
are
some
slight
dents
in
this
good
sword
which
have
not
escaped
the
touch
of
an
old
soldier
how
did
it
come
by
them
oh
a
trifling
skirmish
with
robbers
as
i
came
down
from
hindostan
said
i
and
i
related
to
him
our
affair
with
the
thieves
in
the
nirmul
road
it
was
well
done
said
he
when
i
ended
my
account
but
methinks
you
might
have
followed
up
your
success
and
sliced
some
more
of
the
rogues
a
little
this
weapon
would
not
have
failed
you
if
your
heart
had
not
my
heart
never
failed
me
yet
nuwab
i
replied
those
who
know
me
well
also
know
that
i
burn
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
i
am
a
man
and
no
coward
but
what
could
i
do
in
that
instance
there
were
but
few
of
us
and
the
jungle
was
terribly
thick
we
could
not
have
followed
them
in
the
dark
you
are
right
he
replied
and
what
say
you
my
young
friend
to
following
the
fortunes
of
subzee
khan
he
has
at
present
naught
to
give
thee
but
inshalla
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
men
of
tried
valour
may
win
something
my
friend
dost
mahomed
writes
to
me
to
come
quickly
for
he
has
need
of
leaders
in
his
new
enterprises
and
methinks
your
figure
and
address
would
find
favour
with
him
what
say
you
you
are
not
fit
to
sell
horses
all
the
days
of
your
life
and
if
you
have
turned
any
money
in
your
present
expedition
you
can
not
expend
it
in
a
manner
more
befitting
your
appearance
than
in
getting
a
few
men
together
and
offering
your
service
dost
mahomed
has
need
of
such
youths
as
you
and
inshalla
we
will
yet
do
something
to
win
us
fame
may
your
favour
increase
bundé
nuwaz
cried
i
it
is
the
very
thing
my
soul
longs
for
with
your
introduction
i
can
not
fail
of
obtaining
service
and
if
once
we
have
anything
to
do
you
will
find
i
shall
not
be
backward
then
you
will
accompany
me
said
he
i
am
glad
of
it
you
have
some
men
with
you
i
perceive
and
some
travellers
what
say
you
to
taking
the
direct
road
to
jubbulpoor
it
is
a
rough
one
but
i
am
pressed
for
time
and
that
by
nagpoor
though
free
from
interruption
or
danger
of
robbers
is
much
longer
i
had
determined
on
taking
it
nuwab
sahib
i
replied
even
before
i
saw
you
for
we
are
a
strong
party
and
well
armed
but
now
i
can
have
no
hesitation
as
for
thieves
or
robbers
i
have
no
dread
of
them
and
my
lord
assuredly
can
have
none
none
since
you
have
joined
me
he
said
but
with
the
few
fellows
i
have
i
confess
i
hardly
liked
to
brave
the
jungle
for
the
bands
who
roam
through
it
are
strong
and
merciless
and
it
would
be
a
sorry
fate
for
subzee
khan
to
fall
in
an
unknown
spot
after
a
life
spent
in
and
yet
you
will
do
so
nuwab
sahib
said
i
internally
your
will
reach
you
in
that
jungle
you
dread
and
no
monument
will
mark
the
spot
where
the
remains
of
subzee
khan
will
lie
and
when
shall
you
be
ready
to
move
meer
sahib
continued
he
have
you
aught
to
delay
you
here
nothing
i
replied
i
had
purposed
marching
morning
but
if
my
lord
wishes
i
can
wait
a
few
days
ah
no
morning
i
can
not
move
conveniently
but
the
day
after
i
will
join
you
here
by
daylight
and
we
will
travel
together
jo
hookum
i
replied
i
shall
be
ready
and
now
have
i
permission
to
depart
certainly
he
said
i
will
no
longer
detain
you
for
i
must
be
off
myself
my
friend
sulabut
khan
has
an
entertainment
of
some
kind
and
i
have
promised
to
attend
it
i
returned
to
my
tent
and
though
i
longed
to
break
the
matter
to
my
father
yet
i
refrained
from
doing
so
until
the
nuwab
had
fairly
joined
us
when
i
would
introduce
him
properly
as
we
were
preparing
to
start
the
third
morning
before
daylight
the
nuwab
rode
into
our
camp
and
inquired
for
me
i
was
speedily
with
him
and
my
father
coming
up
to
us
i
introduced
them
to
each
other
after
the
usual
compliments
had
passed
my
father
unobserved
by
the
nuwab
threw
me
a
significant
glance
i
returned
it
and
he
understood
me
a
look
of
triumph
passed
across
his
features
which
gratified
me
because
to
me
alone
was
the
band
indebted
for
the
adventure
which
was
to
follow
our
party
was
soon
in
motion
and
as
the
light
increased
with
the
dawning
day
it
revealed
to
me
the
person
and
dress
of
the
nuwab
who
now
rode
by
my
side
he
was
mounted
on
a
splendid
bay
horse
which
moved
proudly
and
spiritedly
beneath
his
noble
master
the
trappings
of
the
animal
were
of
crimson
velvet
somewhat
soiled
but
still
exceedingly
handsome
for
the
saddlecloth
and
headstall
were
embroidered
with
gold
thread
in
a
rich
pattern
but
the
rider
chiefly
attracted
my
observation
he
wore
a
shirt
of
mail
composed
of
the
finest
steel
links
exquisitely
polished
over
his
ordinary
clothes
at
his
waist
it
was
confined
by
a
handsome
green
shawl
which
he
had
tied
round
him
and
in
which
were
stuck
two
or
three
daggers
mounted
in
gold
and
silver
his
arms
were
cased
in
steel
gauntlets
as
far
as
the
elbows
and
greaves
of
steel
protected
his
thighs
on
his
head
was
a
bright
steel
cap
from
the
top
of
which
a
crimson
silk
tassel
depended
and
a
shawl
handkerchief
was
folded
round
it
to
protect
his
head
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
at
his
back
hung
a
shield
of
rhinoceros
hide
richly
painted
and
gilt
a
long
sword
hung
at
his
side
from
an
embroidered
velvet
belt
which
passed
over
his
shoulder
and
at
his
was
fastened
a
small
with
a
long
and
brightly
polished
steel
handle
well
did
his
appearance
accord
with
his
fame
as
a
warrior
i
had
seen
hundreds
of
soldiers
at
hyderabad
but
i
had
never
yet
looked
on
one
so
perfectly
equipped
as
he
who
now
rode
beside
me
nor
one
could
i
but
have
attached
myself
to
him
in
whom
i
should
have
placed
such
confidence
and
followed
readily
into
the
deadliest
strife
but
what
was
the
use
of
his
weapons
or
his
armour
they
would
not
avail
him
his
hours
were
numbered
and
his
breath
already
in
his
nostrils
you
observe
me
intently
said
he
i
do
i
replied
for
i
have
never
yet
seen
so
perfect
a
cavalier
horse
arms
and
accoutrements
all
agree
in
setting
off
their
noble
owner
do
you
always
travel
thus
always
meer
sahib
a
soldier
should
never
be
out
of
his
harness
the
short
time
i
have
spent
in
idleness
with
that
luxurious
dog
sulabut
khan
has
softened
my
body
and
even
now
i
feel
my
armour
chafe
me
but
the
time
comes
when
i
shall
need
it
and
i
had
as
well
accustom
myself
to
it
we
continued
the
whole
of
the
march
together
and
he
beguiled
the
way
with
relations
of
his
adventures
battles
and
escapes
i
was
as
much
fascinated
by
them
as
by
his
powers
of
conversation
which
were
remarkable
and
i
often
wished
that
i
had
met
him
as
a
friend
or
enrolled
myself
under
him
when
i
might
have
followed
his
banner
and
endeavoured
to
equal
his
deeds
of
valour
but
he
was
marked
in
our
emphatic
language
he
was
become
a
bunij
and
he
was
doomed
to
die
by
every
rule
and
sacred
obligation
of
our
profession
we
reached
our
first
stage
without
any
adventure
beyond
it
the
villagers
told
us
that
the
jungle
grew
thicker
and
thicker
that
the
road
was
very
bad
and
stony
and
above
all
that
the
gonds
were
in
arms
and
plundered
all
whom
they
met
with
let
them
try
us
said
the
nuwab
as
he
listened
to
the
relations
let
them
try
us
inshalla
they
will
do
us
no
harm
and
it
may
be
some
of
them
will
get
broken
crowns
for
their
pains
but
the
next
morning
we
moved
with
more
caution
our
men
were
desired
to
keep
well
together
and
i
picked
out
a
trusty
few
to
surround
the
cart
which
moved
on
with
difficulty
over
the
rough
and
stony
roads
the
nuwab
and
myself
rode
at
the
head
of
the
party
as
we
advanced
the
road
grew
wilder
and
wilder
in
many
places
it
was
narrowed
almost
to
a
footpath
and
the
men
were
obliged
to
cut
away
the
branches
which
often
nearly
met
across
the
road
so
as
to
allow
the
cart
to
proceed
at
other
times
it
ran
between
high
banks
which
almost
overhung
us
and
from
which
missiles
might
have
been
showered
on
our
heads
without
a
possibility
of
our
being
able
to
strike
a
blow
in
that
was
an
ugly
place
nuwab
sahib
said
i
as
we
emerged
from
one
of
these
narrow
passes
into
a
more
open
country
though
still
covered
with
jungle
had
we
been
attacked
there
we
should
assuredly
have
fallen
victims
it
was
indeed
said
he
and
i
am
thankful
we
have
got
out
of
it
if
i
remember
aright
it
has
a
bad
name
from
hence
however
i
think
there
are
no
more
the
jungle
becomes
a
forest
and
there
is
not
so
much
underwood
but
look
cried
he
what
is
that
by
alla
the
gonds
are
upon
us
shumshere
alum
cried
he
in
a
voice
which
rang
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
sumshere
bu
dust
and
his
glittering
blade
flashed
from
the
scabbard
checking
his
horse
and
at
the
same
time
touching
its
flanks
with
his
heels
the
animal
made
two
or
three
bounds
after
which
the
nuwab
fixed
himself
firmly
in
his
seat
pressed
down
his
cap
upon
his
head
and
cried
to
me
to
be
ready
i
was
not
behindhand
my
sword
was
drawn
and
my
shield
disengaged
which
i
placed
before
me
to
guard
me
from
the
arrows
a
few
bounds
of
my
horse
which
was
scarcely
second
to
the
nuwab
brought
me
to
his
side
and
we
were
followed
by
bhudrinath
and
a
few
others
mounted
on
ponies
and
some
men
on
foot
with
their
matchlocks
come
on
ye
sons
of
defiled
mothers
cried
the
nuwab
come
on
and
prove
yourselves
true
men
come
on
and
try
your
cowardly
arrows
against
stout
hearts
and
ready
weapons
kafirs
are
ye
and
cowards
inshalla
your
sisters
are
vile
and
asses
have
loved
your
mothers
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
nuwab
gesticulations
and
abuse
as
he
poured
it
upon
the
gonds
and
shook
his
sword
at
them
they
would
not
move
and
perched
up
as
they
were
on
the
side
of
a
hill
they
prepared
their
bows
to
give
us
a
volley
and
down
it
came
certainly
the
arrows
whistled
past
us
and
one
wounded
the
nuwab
horse
slightly
in
the
neck
at
which
the
gonds
set
up
a
shout
of
triumph
ah
my
poor
motee
thou
art
wounded
cried
he
drawing
the
arrow
from
the
wound
meer
sahib
those
rogues
will
never
come
down
you
had
better
give
them
a
volley
and
disperse
them
now
my
sons
cried
i
to
my
followers
whenever
a
fellow
raises
his
body
to
fire
do
you
mark
him
they
did
so
one
gond
in
particular
who
was
sitting
on
a
rock
drawing
a
large
bow
which
he
placed
against
his
feet
was
a
conspicuous
object
and
apparently
careless
of
his
safety
surfuraz
khan
aimed
at
him
fired
and
in
an
instant
he
rolled
over
and
over
almost
to
our
feet
the
ball
had
hit
him
in
the
throat
and
he
was
quite
dead
the
rest
seeing
his
fate
set
up
loud
yells
and
for
a
moment
we
thought
they
would
have
charged
us
however
another
of
their
number
fell
badly
wounded
and
carrying
him
off
they
rapidly
retreated
to
their
mountain
fastnesses
pursuit
would
have
been
vain
as
it
was
impracticable
we
met
with
no
further
adventure
during
our
march
and
duly
arrived
at
our
stage
by
the
usual
hour
ameer
ali
said
my
father
coming
to
me
shortly
afterwards
is
the
nuwab
to
be
ours
or
not
if
you
have
invited
him
as
a
guest
say
so
if
not
you
had
better
arrange
something
a
guest
cried
i
oh
no
he
must
be
disposed
of
there
can
be
no
difficulty
where
there
so
many
good
places
to
destroy
him
impossible
said
my
father
on
horseback
it
would
be
madness
he
is
a
beautiful
rider
and
his
horse
is
too
spirited
the
least
confusion
would
make
him
bound
and
who
could
hold
him
we
must
devise
some
other
plan
leave
all
to
me
said
i
if
there
is
no
absolute
necessity
for
selecting
a
place
i
will
watch
my
opportunity
chapter
xxiv
i
suppose
you
have
long
ere
this
guessed
my
friends
said
i
to
bhudrinath
and
surfuraz
khan
next
day
why
the
nuwab
is
in
our
company
we
can
have
little
doubt
replied
the
former
since
you
have
brought
him
so
far
but
tell
us
what
are
your
wishes
how
is
it
to
be
managed
it
will
be
impossible
to
attack
him
on
the
road
he
would
cut
down
some
of
us
to
a
certainty
and
i
for
one
have
no
ambition
to
be
made
an
end
of
just
at
present
you
are
right
said
i
we
must
not
risk
anything
still
i
think
an
opportunity
will
not
long
be
wanting
how
cried
both
at
the
same
moment
listen
said
i
and
tell
me
whether
my
plan
meets
with
your
approval
during
the
march
yesterday
the
nuwab
was
regretting
that
we
did
not
fall
in
with
a
good
stream
of
clear
water
that
he
might
take
his
usual
sherbet
you
know
that
the
slave
girl
he
has
with
him
always
prepares
it
now
i
am
in
hopes
that
we
may
meet
one
in
march
and
i
will
try
all
i
can
to
persuade
him
to
alight
and
refresh
himself
while
he
is
engaged
in
conversation
with
me
if
we
find
him
off
his
guard
we
can
fall
on
him
nothing
is
easier
replied
surfuraz
khan
we
can
not
fail
if
he
once
sits
down
his
weapons
will
not
then
serve
him
i
do
not
half
like
the
job
said
bhudrinath
suppose
he
were
to
be
on
his
guard
he
would
assuredly
escape
and
though
both
myself
and
the
khan
here
fear
neither
man
nor
devil
yet
it
is
something
out
of
the
way
to
kill
a
nuwab
he
is
not
a
regular
bunij
and
i
think
ought
to
be
allowed
to
pass
free
of
harm
nonsense
cried
i
this
from
you
bhudrinath
i
am
astonished
what
if
he
be
a
nuwab
is
he
not
a
man
and
have
i
not
fairly
enticed
him
according
to
every
rule
of
our
vocation
it
may
be
something
new
to
kill
a
nuwab
but
think
man
think
on
the
glory
of
being
able
to
say
we
had
killed
subzee
khan
that
valiant
among
the
valiant
why
our
fathers
and
grandfathers
never
did
such
an
act
before
that
is
the
very
reason
why
i
raise
my
voice
against
it
said
he
anything
unusual
is
improper
and
is
often
offensive
to
bhowanee
then
take
the
omens
upon
it
said
i
and
see
what
she
says
inshalla
we
shall
have
the
nuwab
yet
ay
replied
he
now
you
speak
like
a
thug
and
a
proper
one
i
will
take
the
omens
this
evening
and
report
the
result
should
they
be
favourable
you
will
find
bhudrinath
the
last
man
to
desert
you
in
the
evening
the
omens
were
duly
taken
and
proved
to
be
favourable
bhudrinath
came
to
tell
me
the
news
with
great
delight
i
said
how
it
would
be
i
cried
you
were
owls
to
doubt
our
patroness
after
the
luck
she
has
given
us
hitherto
and
now
listen
i
have
not
been
idle
i
have
found
out
from
the
villagers
that
about
four
coss
hence
there
is
a
small
stream
with
plenty
of
water
the
banks
are
covered
with
jungle
as
thick
as
we
could
desire
and
i
have
fixed
on
that
as
the
place
shall
we
send
on
the
lughaees
certainly
said
bhudrinath
we
may
as
well
be
prepared
but
no
continued
he
what
would
be
the
use
of
it
if
the
jungle
is
as
thick
as
you
say
it
is
we
can
easily
conceal
the
bodies
and
at
any
rate
as
there
is
a
river
a
grave
can
soon
be
made
in
the
sand
or
gravel
but
the
nuwab
is
a
powerful
man
meer
sahib
you
had
better
not
risk
yourself
alone
with
him
as
for
the
rest
the
men
have
secured
them
that
is
they
have
arranged
already
who
are
to
do
their
business
so
much
the
better
said
i
for
there
is
little
time
now
to
think
about
it
i
have
selected
one
continued
bhudrinath
the
fellow
who
calls
himself
the
nuwab
jemadar
i
have
scraped
an
intimacy
with
him
and
am
sure
of
him
the
others
have
done
the
same
but
we
left
the
nuwab
to
you
he
is
mine
cried
i
i
did
not
wish
to
be
interfered
with
if
surfuraz
khan
has
not
selected
any
one
i
will
get
him
to
help
me
he
has
not
meer
sahib
that
i
know
of
and
he
is
as
strong
a
man
as
any
we
have
with
us
with
him
and
another
of
his
men
you
can
not
fail
but
let
surfuraz
khan
be
the
shumshea
he
is
a
good
one
i
scarcely
need
one
if
the
nuwab
is
sitting
said
i
though
perhaps
it
is
better
to
have
one
in
case
of
any
difficulty
we
made
all
our
arrangements
that
night
and
next
morning
started
on
our
journey
in
high
spirits
the
nuwab
and
i
as
usual
rode
together
at
the
head
of
the
party
this
is
an
unblest
country
meer
sahib
said
he
as
we
rode
along
didst
thou
ever
see
so
dreary
a
jungle
and
not
a
drop
of
water
to
moisten
the
lips
of
a
true
believer
from
one
end
of
the
stage
to
the
other
it
is
well
the
weather
is
cool
or
we
should
be
sorely
tired
in
our
long
stages
and
here
have
i
subzee
khan
gone
without
my
usual
sherbet
for
three
days
on
this
very
account
by
alla
i
am
now
as
thirsty
as
a
crow
in
the
hot
weather
and
my
mouth
opens
in
spite
of
me
oh
that
we
could
light
on
a
river
or
a
well
in
this
parched
desert
i
would
have
a
glorious
draught
patience
khodawund
cried
i
who
knows
but
we
may
be
near
a
stream
and
then
we
will
make
a
halt
and
refresh
ourselves
i
am
hungry
myself
and
should
not
care
for
an
hour
delay
to
break
my
fast
with
some
dates
i
have
with
me
ha
dates
i
will
have
some
too
my
fellows
may
find
something
to
eat
in
my
wallets
and
thou
sayest
truly
the
cold
wind
of
these
mountains
makes
one
hungry
indeed
but
coss
after
coss
was
left
behind
and
as
yet
no
river
appeared
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
had
received
false
information
and
was
in
no
very
good
humour
at
my
disappointment
when
to
my
joy
on
passing
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
i
saw
the
small
river
the
villagers
had
spoken
of
below
me
there
said
i
khodawund
there
at
last
is
a
river
and
the
sparkling
of
the
water
promises
it
to
be
good
will
you
now
halt
for
an
hour
we
can
have
a
pipe
all
round
and
your
slave
can
prepare
your
sherbet
surely
cried
he
we
may
not
meet
with
another
and
this
is
just
the
time
when
i
like
my
sherbet
best
send
some
one
to
the
rear
for
my
slave
and
bid
her
come
on
quickly
i
dispatched
a
man
for
her
and
reaching
the
stream
we
chose
a
smooth
grassy
spot
and
spreading
the
covers
of
our
saddles
sat
down
one
by
one
as
the
men
arrived
they
also
rested
or
wading
into
the
water
refreshed
themselves
by
washing
their
hands
and
faces
in
the
pure
stream
which
glided
sparkling
over
its
pebbly
bed
the
beasts
too
were
allowed
to
drink
and
all
the
men
sitting
down
in
groups
the
rude
hooka
passed
round
among
them
while
they
cheerfully
discussed
the
merits
of
the
road
they
had
passed
and
what
was
likely
to
be
before
them
casting
a
hasty
glance
around
i
saw
that
all
the
men
were
at
their
posts
three
thugs
to
each
of
the
nuwab
servants
and
retainers
they
were
therefore
sure
azima
cart
was
standing
in
the
road
and
in
order
to
get
her
away
i
went
to
her
beloved
said
i
we
have
halted
here
for
a
short
time
to
allow
of
the
people
taking
some
refreshment
but
you
had
better
proceed
the
road
appears
smooth
and
we
shall
travel
the
faster
to
overtake
you
certainly
she
replied
bid
them
drive
on
for
i
long
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
journey
poor
nurgiz
and
myself
are
well
nigh
jolted
to
death
ah
well
i
said
bear
up
against
it
for
another
stage
or
two
i
promise
you
to
get
a
dooly
if
i
can
at
the
first
large
village
or
town
we
come
to
and
then
you
will
be
comfortable
now
proceed
said
i
to
the
thug
who
acted
as
driver
for
i
had
purchased
a
cart
on
the
road
soon
after
we
left
beeder
and
he
had
driven
it
ever
since
proceed
but
do
not
go
too
fast
she
left
me
and
i
returned
to
the
nuwab
he
was
sitting
in
conversation
with
my
father
and
even
now
was
evidently
partially
intoxicated
with
his
detestable
beverage
ho
meer
sahib
cried
he
what
dost
think
here
have
i
been
endeavouring
to
persuade
this
worthy
father
of
thine
to
take
some
of
my
sherbet
by
alla
is
a
drink
worthy
of
paradise
and
yet
he
swears
it
is
bitter
and
does
not
agree
with
his
stomach
wilt
thou
take
a
drink
and
he
tendered
me
the
cup
drink
man
do
thee
good
and
keep
the
cold
wind
out
of
thee
and
as
to
the
preparation
i
warrant
it
good
for
there
breathes
not
in
the
ten
kingdoms
of
hind
a
slave
so
skilled
in
the
art
of
preparing
subzee
as
kureena
yonder
is
it
not
so
girl
my
lord
favour
is
great
toward
his
slave
said
the
maiden
and
if
he
is
pleased
is
all
she
cares
for
then
bring
another
cup
cried
the
nuwab
now
with
a
few
fair
girls
to
sing
a
ghuzul
or
two
to
us
methinks
a
heaven
might
be
made
out
of
this
wild
spot
it
is
a
good
thought
nuwab
cried
i
chiming
in
with
his
humour
we
will
get
a
set
of
tuwaifs
from
the
next
village
we
come
to
i
dare
say
they
will
accompany
us
for
a
march
or
two
you
say
well
meer
sahib
yours
are
good
words
very
good
words
and
inshalla
we
will
have
the
women
said
the
nuwab
slowly
and
indistinctly
for
he
had
now
swallowed
a
large
quantity
of
the
infusion
which
had
affected
his
head
by
alla
they
should
dance
too
like
this
continued
he
with
energy
and
he
got
up
and
twirled
himself
round
once
or
twice
with
his
arms
extended
throwing
leering
glances
around
upon
us
all
it
was
irresistibly
ludicrous
to
behold
him
his
splendid
armour
and
dress
but
ill
assorted
with
the
mincing
gait
and
absurd
motions
he
was
going
through
and
we
all
laughed
heartily
but
the
farce
was
proceeding
too
long
and
we
had
sterner
matter
in
hand
than
to
waste
our
time
and
opportunity
in
such
fooleries
so
i
begged
him
again
to
be
seated
and
motioned
to
surfuraz
khan
to
be
ready
the
instant
he
should
see
me
go
round
to
his
back
ho
kureena
cried
he
when
he
had
again
seated
himself
bring
more
subzee
my
girl
by
alla
this
thirst
is
unquenchable
and
thou
art
excelling
thyself
in
preparing
it
i
must
have
more
or
i
shall
never
get
to
the
end
of
this
vile
stage
i
feel
now
as
if
i
could
sleep
and
some
more
will
revive
me
fazil
khan
bring
my
hooka
cried
i
as
loud
as
i
could
it
was
the
signal
we
had
agreed
on
ay
cried
the
nuwab
i
will
beg
a
whiff
or
two
be
agreeable
with
my
sherbet
i
had
now
moved
round
behind
him
my
roomal
was
in
my
hand
and
i
signalled
to
surfuraz
khan
to
seize
him
look
nuwab
cried
he
and
he
laid
hold
on
his
right
arm
with
a
firm
grasp
how
dare
you
touch
me
slave
ejaculated
subzee
khan
how
dare
you
touch
a
nuwab
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
i
had
thrown
the
cloth
about
his
neck
surfuraz
khan
still
held
his
hand
and
my
father
pulled
at
his
legs
with
all
his
force
the
nuwab
snored
several
times
like
a
man
in
a
deep
sleep
but
my
grip
was
firm
and
did
not
relax
a
horse
would
have
died
under
it
suddenly
as
he
writhed
under
me
every
muscle
in
his
body
quivered
he
snored
again
still
louder
and
the
now
yielding
form
offered
no
resistance
i
gazed
upon
his
features
and
saw
that
the
breath
of
life
had
passed
from
the
body
it
had
but
now
animated
subzee
khan
was
dead
i
had
destroyed
the
slayer
of
hundreds
but
no
one
had
thought
of
his
poor
slave
girl
who
at
some
distance
and
with
her
back
turned
to
us
had
been
busily
engaged
in
preparing
another
rich
draught
for
her
now
unconscious
master
she
had
not
heard
the
noise
of
our
scuffle
nor
the
deep
groans
which
had
escaped
from
some
of
the
nuwab
people
and
she
approached
the
spot
where
surfuraz
khan
was
now
employed
in
stripping
the
armour
and
dress
from
the
dead
body
ya
alla
sahib
what
a
piercing
shriek
escaped
her
when
she
saw
what
had
been
done
i
shall
never
forget
it
nor
her
look
of
horror
and
misery
as
she
rushed
forward
and
threw
herself
on
the
body
although
master
and
slave
sahib
they
had
loved
her
lips
were
glued
to
those
of
the
unconscious
corpse
which
had
so
often
returned
her
warm
caresses
and
she
murmured
in
her
agony
all
the
endearing
terms
by
which
she
had
used
in
their
private
hours
to
call
him
and
implored
him
to
awake
he
can
not
be
dead
he
can
not
be
dead
cried
the
fair
girl
for
she
was
beautiful
to
look
on
sahib
as
she
partly
rose
and
brushed
back
her
dishevelled
hair
from
her
eyes
and
yet
he
moves
not
he
speaks
not
and
she
gazed
on
his
features
for
a
moment
ah
she
screamed
look
at
his
eyes
look
at
them
they
will
fall
out
of
his
head
and
his
countenance
is
not
my
own
lord
those
are
not
the
lips
which
have
often
spoken
kind
words
to
his
poor
kureena
oh
my
heart
what
a
pain
is
there
this
will
never
do
cried
i
some
of
you
put
her
out
of
her
misery
for
my
part
i
war
not
with
women
the
girl
is
fair
said
surfuraz
khan
i
will
give
her
a
last
chance
for
life
hark
you
cried
he
to
her
this
is
no
time
for
fooling
and
as
he
rudely
shook
her
by
the
arm
she
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
piteous
expression
and
pointed
to
the
body
by
which
she
was
kneeling
and
mourning
as
she
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
hear
me
cried
the
khan
those
who
have
done
that
work
will
end
thy
miserable
life
unless
thou
hearkenest
to
reason
i
have
no
wife
no
child
thou
shalt
be
both
to
me
if
thou
wilt
rise
and
follow
me
why
waste
further
thought
on
the
dead
and
thou
wast
his
slave
too
rise
i
say
again
and
thy
life
is
spared
thou
shalt
be
free
who
spoke
to
me
said
she
in
tones
scarcely
audible
ah
do
not
take
me
from
him
my
heart
is
broken
i
am
dying
and
you
would
not
part
us
listen
fool
exclaimed
the
khan
before
this
assembly
i
promise
thee
life
and
a
happy
home
yet
thou
hearkenest
not
tempt
not
thy
fate
a
word
from
me
and
thou
diest
wilt
thou
then
follow
me
my
horse
is
ready
we
will
leave
the
dead
and
think
no
more
on
the
fate
of
him
who
lies
there
think
no
more
on
him
forget
him
my
own
my
noble
lover
oh
no
no
no
is
he
not
dead
and
i
too
am
dying
again
i
warn
thee
miserable
girl
cried
surfuraz
khan
urge
me
not
to
use
force
i
would
that
you
followed
me
willingly
as
yet
i
have
not
laid
hands
on
thee
a
low
moan
was
her
only
reply
as
she
turned
again
to
the
dead
and
caressed
the
distorted
and
now
stiffening
features
away
with
the
body
cried
i
to
some
of
the
lughaees
who
were
waiting
to
do
their
office
one
would
think
ye
were
all
a
parcel
of
girls
like
that
mourning
wretch
there
are
we
to
stay
loitering
here
because
of
her
fooling
away
with
it
my
order
was
obeyed
four
of
them
seized
the
body
and
bore
it
off
in
spite
of
the
now
frantic
exertions
of
the
slave
they
were
of
no
avail
she
was
held
by
two
men
and
her
struggles
to
free
herself
gradually
exhausted
her
now
is
your
time
cried
i
to
surfuraz
khan
lay
hold
of
her
in
the
name
of
the
thousand
shitans
since
you
must
have
her
and
put
her
on
your
horse
you
can
hold
her
on
and
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
can
not
keep
her
quiet
surfuraz
khan
raised
her
in
his
arms
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
though
now
restored
to
consciousness
as
she
by
turns
reviled
us
denounced
us
as
murderers
and
implored
us
to
kill
her
he
bore
her
off
and
placed
her
on
his
horse
but
it
was
of
no
use
her
screams
were
terrific
and
her
struggles
to
be
free
almost
defied
the
efforts
of
surfuraz
khan
on
one
side
and
one
of
his
men
on
the
other
to
hold
her
on
we
proceeded
about
half
a
coss
in
this
manner
when
my
father
who
had
hitherto
been
a
silent
spectator
rode
up
as
i
was
again
vainly
endeavouring
to
persuade
the
slave
to
be
quiet
and
to
bear
with
her
fate
this
is
worse
than
folly
cried
he
it
is
madness
and
you
above
all
surfuraz
khan
to
be
enamoured
of
a
girl
in
such
a
hurry
what
could
we
do
were
we
to
meet
travellers
she
would
denounce
us
to
them
and
then
a
fine
piece
of
business
we
should
have
made
of
it
shame
on
you
do
you
not
know
your
duty
better
i
have
no
more
to
say
to
the
devil
said
the
man
on
the
left
of
the
horse
doggedly
you
may
even
get
her
on
the
best
way
you
can
what
with
her
and
the
horse
a
pretty
time
i
am
likely
to
have
of
it
to
the
end
of
the
journey
and
he
quitted
his
hold
ay
said
i
and
think
you
that
tongue
of
hers
will
be
silent
when
we
reach
our
stage
what
will
you
do
with
her
then
devil
cried
the
khan
striking
her
violently
on
the
face
with
his
sheathed
sword
will
you
not
sit
quiet
and
let
me
lead
the
horse
the
violence
with
which
he
had
struck
caused
the
sword
to
cut
through
its
wooden
scabbard
and
it
had
inflicted
a
severe
wound
on
her
face
there
cried
my
father
you
have
spoilt
her
beauty
at
any
rate
by
your
violence
what
do
you
now
want
with
her
she
is
quiet
at
all
events
said
the
khan
and
he
led
the
horse
a
short
distance
but
the
blow
had
only
partly
stunned
her
and
she
recovered
to
a
fresh
consciousness
of
her
situation
the
blood
trickled
down
her
face
and
she
wiped
it
away
with
her
hand
she
looked
piteously
at
it
for
an
instant
and
the
next
dashed
herself
violently
to
the
earth
one
of
you
hold
the
animal
cried
the
khan
till
i
put
her
up
again
but
she
struggled
more
than
ever
and
rent
the
air
with
her
screams
he
drew
his
sword
and
raised
it
over
her
strike
she
cried
murderer
and
villain
as
you
are
strike
and
end
the
wretched
life
of
the
poor
slave
you
have
already
wounded
me
and
another
blow
will
free
me
from
my
misery
i
thought
i
could
have
died
then
but
death
will
not
come
to
me
will
you
not
kill
me
and
she
spat
on
him
this
is
not
to
be
borne
fool
that
i
was
to
take
so
much
trouble
to
preserve
a
worthless
life
cried
the
khan
sheathing
his
sword
thou
shalt
die
and
that
quickly
he
threw
his
roomal
about
her
neck
and
she
writhed
in
her
death
agonies
under
his
fatal
grasp
there
cried
he
quitting
his
hold
i
would
it
had
been
otherwise
but
it
was
her
fate
and
i
have
accomplished
it
and
he
left
the
body
and
strode
on
in
moody
silence
some
of
the
lughaees
coming
up
the
body
was
hastily
interred
among
the
bushes
which
skirted
the
road
and
nothing
now
preventing
us
we
pursued
our
journey
with
all
the
speed
we
could
thankful
was
i
that
i
had
sent
on
azima
in
her
cart
she
was
far
beyond
the
scene
of
violence
which
had
happened
and
of
which
she
must
have
guessed
the
cause
had
she
been
within
hearing
but
the
driver
of
her
cart
had
hurried
on
and
we
had
travelled
some
coss
ere
we
overtook
her
strange
sahib
that
after
that
day
surfuraz
khan
was
no
longer
the
merry
being
he
had
used
to
be
he
was
no
novice
at
his
work
hundreds
of
human
beings
both
male
and
female
had
died
under
his
hand
but
from
the
hour
he
killed
the
slave
he
was
an
altered
being
he
used
to
sit
in
silent
moody
abstraction
his
eyes
gazing
on
vacancy
and
when
we
rallied
him
upon
it
his
only
reply
was
a
melancholy
smile
as
he
shook
his
head
and
declared
that
his
spirit
was
gone
his
eyes
too
would
on
these
occasions
sometimes
fill
with
tears
and
sighs
enough
to
break
his
heart
would
escape
from
him
he
accompanied
us
to
our
home
got
his
share
of
the
booty
which
he
immediately
distributed
among
the
poorer
members
of
the
band
and
after
bidding
us
a
melancholy
farewell
stripped
himself
of
all
his
clothes
covered
his
body
with
ashes
and
went
forth
into
the
rude
world
to
bear
its
buffets
and
scorn
in
the
guise
of
a
fakeer
i
heard
years
afterwards
that
he
returned
to
the
spot
where
he
had
killed
the
girl
constructed
a
hut
by
the
and
ministered
to
the
wants
of
travellers
in
that
wild
region
where
his
only
companions
must
have
been
the
bear
the
tiger
and
the
wolf
i
never
saw
him
again
after
he
parted
from
us
and
many
among
us
regretted
his
absence
and
his
daring
skill
and
bravery
in
the
expeditions
in
which
we
afterwards
engaged
his
place
was
never
filled
among
us
i
have
no
more
adventures
of
this
expedition
to
relate
to
you
we
reached
our
home
in
due
course
without
any
accident
or
interruption
and
who
will
not
say
that
we
enjoyed
its
quiet
sweets
and
appreciated
them
the
more
after
our
long
absence
and
the
excitement
and
perils
of
our
journey
i
was
completely
happy
secure
in
the
increasing
love
and
affection
of
azima
whose
sweet
disposition
developed
itself
more
and
more
every
day
i
was
raised
to
a
high
rank
among
my
associates
for
what
i
had
achieved
was
duly
related
to
those
who
had
stayed
in
our
village
and
to
others
who
had
been
out
on
small
expeditions
about
the
country
and
the
immense
booty
we
had
acquired
and
my
determination
to
retire
from
active
life
pointed
me
out
as
a
leader
of
great
fortune
and
one
to
whom
many
would
be
glad
to
entrust
themselves
in
any
subsequent
expedition
as
i
appeared
to
be
an
especial
favourite
of
our
patroness
the
return
of
hoosein
party
about
two
months
after
we
had
arrived
was
an
event
of
great
rejoicing
to
us
all
when
they
reached
our
village
as
we
had
agreed
beforehand
at
our
separation
the
whole
of
the
proceeds
of
the
expeditions
of
both
parties
were
put
into
one
for
general
distribution
and
on
a
day
appointed
it
took
place
sahib
you
will
hardly
believe
it
when
i
tell
you
that
the
whole
amounted
to
very
nearly
a
lakh
of
rupees
it
was
carried
by
general
acclamation
that
i
should
share
as
a
jemadar
and
according
to
the
rules
of
our
band
i
received
of
the
whole
bhudrinath
and
surfuraz
khan
received
what
i
did
but
the
latter
only
of
such
portion
as
we
had
won
since
he
had
joined
us
i
forget
how
much
it
was
but
as
i
have
told
you
he
divided
it
among
the
poorer
members
of
the
band
and
having
apparently
stayed
with
us
only
for
this
purpose
he
left
us
immediately
as
i
have
before
mentioned
upon
the
sum
i
had
thus
acquired
i
lived
peacefully
two
years
i
longed
often
to
go
out
on
small
expeditions
about
the
country
but
my
father
would
not
hear
of
it
what
is
the
use
he
would
say
you
have
ample
means
of
subsistence
for
two
years
to
come
my
wealth
you
know
is
also
large
and
until
we
find
the
supply
running
short
why
should
you
risk
life
in
an
attempt
to
gain
more
riches
which
you
do
not
need
but
my
spirit
sorely
rebelled
against
leading
such
an
inactive
and
inglorious
life
and
every
deed
i
heard
of
only
made
me
more
impatient
to
cast
off
the
sloth
which
i
feared
would
gain
hold
on
me
and
to
mingle
once
more
in
the
exciting
and
daring
exploits
of
my
profession
still
i
was
fond
of
my
home
azima
had
presented
me
with
a
lovely
boy
who
was
the
pride
of
my
existence
and
about
the
time
i
am
speaking
of
i
expected
another
addition
to
my
family
i
had
already
seen
two
seasons
for
departure
pass
and
a
third
was
close
at
hand
but
i
suffered
this
also
to
elapse
in
inactivity
although
i
was
repeatedly
and
strongly
urged
by
bhudrinath
and
others
to
try
my
fortune
and
head
another
band
to
penetrate
into
bengal
where
we
were
assured
of
ample
employment
and
success
but
much
as
i
wished
to
accompany
them
my
father
still
objected
something
had
impressed
him
with
an
idea
that
the
expedition
would
be
unfortunate
and
so
in
truth
it
turned
out
a
large
gang
under
several
leaders
set
out
from
our
village
at
the
usual
time
but
the
omens
although
not
absolutely
bad
were
not
very
encouraging
and
this
had
a
dire
effect
on
the
whole
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
jealousies
and
quarrels
sprang
up
among
the
several
leaders
they
separated
from
each
other
and
pursued
different
ways
one
by
one
they
returned
disappointed
with
their
expedition
having
gained
very
little
booty
scarcely
sufficient
to
support
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
but
one
party
was
never
heard
of
more
it
consisted
of
my
poor
friend
bhudrinath
and
six
noble
fellows
he
had
taken
with
him
years
afterwards
we
heard
his
fate
he
had
gone
down
into
bengal
had
visited
calcutta
and
up
to
that
period
had
been
most
successful
but
there
his
men
dissipated
their
gains
in
debauchery
and
they
set
out
on
their
return
with
barely
sufficient
to
carry
them
a
few
marches
they
had
nearly
reached
benares
when
absolute
starvation
staring
them
in
the
face
they
attacked
some
travellers
and
as
they
thought
killed
them
they
neglected
however
to
bury
their
victims
and
one
who
was
not
dead
revived
he
gave
information
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
nearest
village
my
poor
friends
were
overtaken
seized
the
property
they
had
about
them
immediately
recognized
and
the
evidence
given
by
the
survivor
of
the
party
they
had
attacked
was
convincing
what
could
oppose
this
the
law
had
its
course
and
they
were
tried
and
hanged
ameer
ali
here
stopped
in
his
narrative
and
promising
to
resume
it
in
a
few
days
he
requested
permission
to
withdraw
and
making
his
usual
salam
departed
a
strange
page
in
the
book
of
human
life
is
this
thought
i
as
he
left
the
room
that
man
the
perpetrator
of
so
many
hundred
murders
thinks
on
the
past
with
satisfaction
and
pleasure
nay
he
takes
a
pride
in
recalling
the
events
of
his
life
almost
every
one
of
which
is
a
murder
and
glories
in
describing
the
minutest
particulars
of
his
victims
and
the
share
he
had
in
their
destruction
with
scarcely
a
symptom
of
remorse
once
or
twice
only
has
he
winced
while
telling
his
fearful
story
and
what
agitated
him
most
at
the
commencement
of
his
tale
i
have
yet
to
hear
with
almost
only
that
exception
his
spirit
has
seemed
to
rise
with
the
relation
of
the
past
and
his
own
native
eloquence
at
times
when
warmed
with
his
tale
and
under
the
influence
of
his
vivid
imagination
and
faithful
memory
has
been
worthy
of
a
better
pen
and
a
more
able
translator
than
i
am
but
let
this
pass
i
repeat
it
is
a
strange
and
horrible
page
in
the
varied
record
of
humanity
murderers
there
have
been
in
every
country
under
heaven
from
the
time
of
cain
to
the
present
murderers
from
hate
from
revenge
from
jealousy
from
fear
from
the
instigation
of
any
and
every
evil
passion
of
our
nature
but
a
murderer
life
has
ever
been
depicted
as
one
of
constant
misery
the
worm
that
dieth
not
the
agony
and
reproach
of
a
guilty
conscience
gnawing
at
the
heart
corroding
and
blasting
every
enjoyment
of
life
and
either
causing
its
wretched
victim
to
end
his
existence
by
suicide
to
deliver
himself
up
to
justice
or
to
be
worn
down
by
mental
suffering
a
more
dreadful
fate
perhaps
than
the
others
such
are
the
descriptions
we
have
heard
and
read
of
murderers
but
these
thugs
are
unlike
any
others
no
remorse
seems
to
possess
their
souls
in
the
weariness
of
perpetual
imprisonment
one
would
think
their
imaginations
and
recollections
of
the
past
would
be
insupportable
to
them
but
no
they
eat
drink
and
sleep
like
others
are
solicitous
about
their
dress
ever
ready
to
talk
over
the
past
and
would
if
released
again
follow
their
dreadful
profession
with
a
fresh
zest
after
their
temporary
preclusion
from
it
strange
too
that
hindoo
and
moslem
of
every
sect
and
denomination
should
join
with
one
accord
in
the
superstition
from
which
this
horrible
trade
has
arisen
in
the
hindoo
perhaps
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
as
the
goddess
who
protects
him
is
one
whom
all
castes
regard
with
reverence
and
hold
in
the
utmost
dread
but
as
for
the
moslem
unless
his
conduct
springs
from
that
terrible
doctrine
of
fatalism
with
which
every
true
believer
is
thoroughly
imbued
from
the
first
dawn
of
his
reason
it
is
difficult
to
assign
a
reason
for
the
horrible
pursuit
he
has
engaged
in
his
koran
denounces
murderers
blood
for
blood
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
is
the
doctrine
of
his
prophet
which
he
trembles
at
while
he
and
ameer
ali
is
a
bhula
admee
even
in
the
eyes
of
his
jailers
a
respectable
man
a
religious
man
one
who
from
his
youth
up
has
said
his
namaz
five
times
a
day
is
most
devout
in
his
life
and
conduct
is
most
particular
in
his
ablutions
keeps
the
fast
of
the
ramzan
and
every
saint
day
in
his
calendar
dresses
in
green
clothes
in
the
mohorum
and
beats
his
breast
and
tears
his
hair
as
a
good
syud
of
hindostan
ought
to
do
in
short
he
performs
the
thousand
and
one
ceremonies
of
his
religion
and
believes
himself
as
sure
of
heaven
and
all
the
houris
promised
there
as
he
now
is
of
a
good
dinner
and
yet
ameer
ali
is
a
murderer
one
before
whom
every
murderer
of
the
known
world
in
times
past
or
present
except
perhaps
some
of
his
own
profession
the
free
bands
of
germany
the
lanzknechts
the
banditti
condottieri
of
italy
the
buccaneers
and
pirates
and
in
our
own
time
the
fraternity
of
burkes
and
hares
a
degenerate
system
of
thuggee
by
the
bye
at
which
ameer
ali
when
i
told
him
of
them
laughed
heartily
and
said
they
were
sad
bunglers
must
be
counted
men
of
small
account
reader
these
thoughts
were
passing
in
my
mind
when
at
last
i
cried
aloud
pshaw
is
vain
to
attempt
to
account
for
it
but
thuggee
seems
to
be
the
offspring
of
fatalism
and
superstition
cherished
and
perfected
by
the
wildest
excitement
that
ever
urged
human
beings
to
deeds
at
which
humanity
shudders
did
khodawund
call
said
a
bearer
who
had
gradually
nodded
to
sleep
as
he
was
pulling
the
punkah
above
my
head
and
who
was
roused
by
my
exclamation
did
the
sahib
call
no
boodun
i
did
not
but
since
you
are
awake
bid
some
one
bring
me
a
chilum
my
nerves
require
to
be
composed
chapter
xxv
at
the
expiration
of
a
week
ameer
ali
sent
word
to
me
that
he
was
ready
to
resume
his
narrative
and
i
lost
no
time
in
requesting
him
to
repair
to
my
residence
he
arrived
and
making
his
usual
graceful
obeisance
i
desired
him
to
be
seated
the
reader
will
perhaps
like
to
know
something
of
the
appearance
of
the
man
with
whom
he
and
i
have
had
these
long
conversations
and
no
longer
to
keep
him
in
the
dark
on
so
important
a
subject
i
will
describe
ameer
ali
to
him
he
is
what
would
be
called
a
short
man
about
five
feet
seven
inches
in
height
his
figure
is
now
slender
which
may
be
the
effect
of
his
long
imprisonment
imprisonment
it
can
hardly
be
called
except
that
to
one
of
his
formerly
free
and
unrestrained
habits
and
pursuits
the
smallest
restraint
must
of
course
be
irksome
in
the
highest
degree
and
painful
to
bear
his
age
may
be
about
or
forty
years
but
it
sits
lightly
on
him
for
a
native
of
india
and
it
has
not
in
the
least
whitened
a
beard
and
mustachios
on
which
he
evidently
expends
great
care
and
pains
and
which
are
always
trimmed
and
curled
with
the
greatest
neatness
his
figure
as
i
have
said
is
slight
but
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
compact
agile
and
muscular
and
his
arms
are
remarkable
for
the
latter
quality
combined
with
unusual
length
and
sinewiness
his
dress
is
always
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
and
put
on
with
more
attention
to
effect
than
is
usual
with
his
brother
approvers
his
turban
being
always
tied
with
a
smart
cock
and
his
waist
tightly
girded
with
an
english
shawl
or
a
handkerchief
where
once
a
shawl
of
cashmere
or
a
handkerchief
of
brocade
was
better
suited
to
his
pretensions
in
complexion
he
is
fair
for
a
native
his
face
is
even
now
strikingly
handsome
and
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
accounts
of
his
youthful
appearance
have
not
been
exaggerated
his
forehead
is
high
and
broad
his
eyes
large
sparkling
and
very
expressive
especially
when
his
eloquence
kindles
and
bursts
forth
in
a
torrent
of
figurative
language
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
render
into
english
or
if
it
were
rendered
would
appear
to
the
english
reader
unused
to
such
forms
of
speech
highly
exaggerated
and
absurd
his
cheeks
are
somewhat
sunken
but
his
nose
is
aquiline
and
elegantly
formed
and
his
mouth
small
and
beautifully
chiselled
and
his
teeth
are
exquisitely
white
and
even
his
upper
lip
is
graced
with
a
pair
of
small
mustachios
which
would
be
the
envy
of
many
a
gay
lieutenant
of
hussars
while
a
beard
close
and
wavy
from
which
a
straggling
hair
is
never
suffered
to
escape
descends
nearly
to
his
breast
and
hides
a
throat
and
neck
which
would
be
a
study
for
a
painter
or
a
sculptor
to
complete
all
his
chest
is
very
broad
and
prominent
and
well
contrasts
with
the
effect
of
his
small
waist
his
manner
is
graceful
bland
and
polite
it
is
indeed
more
than
it
is
courtly
and
i
have
not
seen
it
equalled
even
by
the
mahomedan
noblemen
with
many
of
whom
i
have
associated
any
of
my
readers
who
may
have
been
in
india
and
become
acquainted
with
its
nobles
and
men
of
rank
will
estimate
at
once
how
high
is
the
meed
of
praise
on
this
score
which
i
give
to
ameer
ali
his
language
is
pure
and
fluent
perhaps
a
little
affected
from
his
knowledge
of
persian
which
though
slight
is
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
introduce
words
and
expressions
in
that
language
often
when
they
are
not
needed
but
still
it
is
pure
oordoo
he
prides
himself
upon
it
and
holds
in
supreme
contempt
those
who
speak
the
corrupt
patois
of
the
dukhun
or
the
still
worse
one
of
hindostan
altogether
ameer
ali
is
a
character
and
a
man
of
immense
importance
in
his
own
opinion
and
that
of
every
one
else
and
the
swagger
which
he
has
now
adopted
in
his
gait
but
which
is
evidently
foreign
to
him
does
not
sit
amiss
on
his
now
reduced
condition
reader
if
you
can
embody
these
descriptions
you
have
ameer
ali
before
you
and
while
you
gaze
on
the
picture
in
your
imagination
and
look
on
the
mild
and
expressive
face
you
may
have
fancied
you
as
i
was
would
be
the
last
person
to
think
that
he
was
a
professed
murderer
and
one
who
in
the
course
of
his
life
has
committed
upwards
of
seven
hundred
murders
i
mean
by
this
that
he
has
been
actively
and
personally
engaged
in
the
destruction
of
that
number
of
human
beings
now
ameer
ali
said
i
since
i
have
finished
describing
your
appearance
i
hope
you
are
ready
to
contribute
more
to
the
stock
of
adventures
you
have
already
related
your
slave
is
ready
sahib
he
replied
and
inshalla
he
will
not
disappoint
you
but
why
has
my
lord
described
my
poor
appearance
which
is
now
miserable
enough
but
might
your
slave
ask
what
you
have
written
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
implied
that
he
had
concluded
it
could
not
be
favourable
listen
said
i
and
i
will
read
it
to
you
at
every
sentence
the
expression
of
his
face
brightened
when
i
had
concluded
he
said
it
is
a
faithful
picture
such
as
i
behold
myself
when
i
look
in
a
glass
you
have
omitted
nothing
even
to
the
most
trifling
particulars
nay
i
may
even
say
my
lord
has
flattered
and
he
arose
and
made
a
profound
salam
no
said
i
i
have
not
flattered
your
external
appearance
which
is
prepossessing
but
of
your
heart
i
fear
those
who
read
will
judge
for
themselves
and
their
opinions
will
not
be
such
as
you
could
wish
but
such
as
you
deserve
you
think
my
heart
bad
then
sahib
certainly
i
do
but
it
is
not
so
he
continued
have
i
not
ever
been
a
kind
husband
and
a
faithful
friend
did
i
not
love
my
children
and
wife
while
he
who
is
above
spared
them
to
me
and
do
i
not
even
now
bitterly
mourn
their
deaths
where
is
the
man
existing
who
can
say
a
word
against
ameer
ali
honour
which
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
remain
pure
and
unsullied
have
i
ever
broken
a
social
tie
ever
been
unfaithful
or
unkind
to
a
comrade
ever
failed
in
my
duty
or
in
my
trust
ever
neglected
a
rite
or
ceremony
of
my
religion
i
tell
you
sahib
the
man
breathes
not
who
could
point
his
finger
at
me
on
any
one
of
these
points
and
if
you
think
on
them
they
are
those
which
if
rigidly
kept
gain
for
a
man
esteem
and
honour
in
the
world
but
the
seven
hundred
murders
ameer
ali
what
can
you
say
to
them
they
make
a
fearful
balance
against
you
in
the
other
scale
ah
those
are
a
different
matter
said
the
thug
laughing
quite
a
different
matter
i
can
never
persuade
you
that
i
was
fully
authorized
to
commit
them
and
only
a
humble
instrument
in
the
hands
of
alla
did
i
kill
one
of
those
persons
no
it
was
he
had
my
roomal
been
a
thousand
times
thrown
about
their
necks
and
the
strength
of
an
elephant
in
my
arms
could
i
have
done
aught
would
they
have
died
without
it
was
his
will
i
tell
you
sahib
they
would
not
they
could
not
but
as
i
shall
never
be
able
to
persuade
you
to
think
otherwise
and
as
it
is
not
respectful
in
me
to
bandy
words
with
my
lord
i
think
it
is
time
for
me
to
recommence
my
tale
if
he
is
ready
to
listen
for
i
have
still
much
to
relate
i
have
been
so
minute
in
the
particulars
of
my
first
expedition
that
perhaps
i
need
not
make
the
narrative
of
the
other
events
of
my
life
so
prolix
indeed
were
i
to
do
so
you
sahib
would
be
tired
of
writing
and
your
countrymen
of
reading
for
it
would
be
an
almost
endless
task
to
follow
me
in
every
expedition
i
undertook
i
shall
therefore
with
your
permission
confine
myself
to
the
narration
of
those
which
i
think
will
most
interest
you
and
which
i
remember
to
possess
remarkable
incidents
go
on
said
i
i
listen
well
then
said
the
thug
khodawund
must
remember
that
i
told
him
i
passed
over
three
expeditions
and
that
i
had
partly
determined
to
go
on
the
third
it
is
of
that
expedition
i
would
now
speak
as
it
was
marked
by
an
extraordinary
circumstance
which
will
show
you
at
once
that
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
avoid
his
fate
if
it
be
the
will
of
alla
that
he
should
die
at
the
time
i
speak
of
i
had
been
obliged
to
form
another
set
of
intimates
in
consequence
of
the
loss
of
bhudrinath
and
surfuraz
khan
for
both
of
whom
i
had
the
sincerest
regard
hoosein
though
i
loved
and
revered
him
as
my
father
dearest
friend
was
now
too
old
and
grave
to
participate
in
all
my
thoughts
and
perhaps
wild
aspirations
for
distinction
so
as
peer
khan
and
with
whose
names
you
are
familiar
had
now
risen
to
my
own
rank
and
proved
themselves
to
be
good
men
and
true
in
various
expeditions
i
took
them
into
my
confidence
and
we
planned
an
enterprise
of
which
i
was
to
be
the
leader
and
they
my
subordinates
fifty
of
the
youngest
stoutest
and
most
active
and
enterprising
of
our
acquaintance
were
fixed
on
as
the
band
and
all
having
been
previously
warned
we
met
a
few
days
before
the
dussera
of
the
year
in
a
grove
near
our
village
which
was
shady
and
well
adapted
for
large
assemblies
and
was
always
used
as
a
place
of
meeting
and
deliberation
it
was
considered
a
lucky
spot
no
unfortunate
expedition
ever
having
set
out
from
it
we
were
all
assembled
it
was
a
lovely
morning
and
the
grass
as
yet
not
even
browned
by
the
sun
and
drought
was
as
if
a
soft
and
beautiful
carpet
had
been
spread
on
purpose
for
us
the
surrounding
fields
many
of
them
tilled
by
our
own
hands
waved
in
green
luxuriance
and
the
wind
as
it
passed
over
them
in
gentle
gusts
caused
each
stalk
of
tall
jowaree
to
be
agitated
while
the
sun
shining
brightly
made
the
whole
glitter
so
that
it
was
almost
painful
to
look
on
for
a
continuance
birds
sang
in
the
lofty
banian
trees
which
overshadowed
us
hundreds
of
green
parroquets
sported
and
screamed
in
their
branches
as
they
flew
from
bough
to
bough
some
in
apparent
sport
others
to
feed
on
the
now
ripening
berries
of
the
trees
and
the
whole
grove
resounded
with
the
cooing
of
innumerable
whose
gentle
and
loving
murmurs
soothed
the
turbulence
of
the
heart
and
bade
it
be
at
peace
and
rest
and
as
happy
as
they
were
my
father
and
hoosein
were
present
to
guide
us
by
their
counsels
and
experience
and
the
matter
in
hand
was
commenced
by
a
sacrifice
and
invocation
to
bhowanee
but
as
i
have
before
described
these
ceremonies
it
is
needless
to
repeat
them
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
omens
were
taken
and
were
favourable
in
the
highest
degree
they
assured
us
and
though
i
had
little
faith
in
them
notwithstanding
all
i
had
heard
to
convince
me
of
their
necessity
they
inspirited
the
whole
band
and
i
partook
of
the
general
hilarity
consequent
upon
them
my
father
opened
the
object
of
the
meeting
in
a
short
address
he
said
he
was
old
and
no
longer
fitted
for
the
fatigues
and
privations
of
a
journey
he
recapitulated
all
i
had
done
on
the
former
expedition
pointed
out
the
various
instances
in
which
i
had
displayed
activity
daring
and
prudence
beyond
my
years
and
concluded
by
imploring
the
men
to
place
implicit
confidence
in
me
to
obey
me
in
all
things
as
though
he
himself
were
present
and
above
all
not
to
give
way
to
any
disposition
to
quarrel
among
themselves
which
would
infallibly
lead
to
the
same
disastrous
results
as
had
overtaken
the
expedition
which
had
gone
out
the
previous
year
they
one
and
all
rose
after
this
address
and
by
mutual
consent
swore
on
the
sacred
pickaxe
to
obey
me
the
most
impressive
oath
they
could
take
and
any
deviation
from
which
they
all
firmly
believed
would
draw
down
the
vengeance
of
our
protectress
upon
them
and
lead
to
their
destruction
i
will
not
occupy
your
time
sahib
by
a
narration
of
what
i
myself
said
suffice
it
to
say
i
proposed
that
the
band
should
take
the
high
road
to
the
dukhun
and
penetrate
as
far
as
jubbulpoor
or
nagpoor
from
thence
we
would
take
a
direction
eastward
or
westward
as
hope
of
booty
offered
and
so
return
to
our
home
khândésh
i
mentioned
as
being
but
little
known
to
us
thugs
and
where
i
thought
it
likely
we
might
meet
with
good
booty
as
i
had
heard
that
the
traders
of
bombay
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
large
quantities
of
treasure
to
their
correspondents
in
malwa
for
the
purchase
of
opium
and
other
products
of
that
district
i
concluded
by
assuring
them
that
i
had
a
strong
presentiment
of
great
success
that
i
felt
confidence
in
myself
and
that
if
they
would
only
follow
me
faithfully
and
truly
we
might
return
in
a
few
months
as
well
laden
with
spoil
as
we
had
on
the
former
occasion
again
they
rose
and
pledged
their
faith
and
truly
it
was
a
solemn
sight
to
see
those
determined
men
nerve
themselves
for
an
enterprise
which
might
end
happily
but
which
exposed
them
to
fearful
risk
of
detection
dishonour
and
death
chapter
xxvi
our
meeting
broke
up
and
i
returned
to
prepare
azima
for
my
departure
i
had
invented
a
tale
to
excuse
my
absence
i
told
her
that
the
money
which
i
had
gained
on
my
mercantile
expedition
to
the
dukhun
was
now
nearly
expended
and
although
in
her
society
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
happiness
such
as
i
had
never
hoped
for
i
had
been
hitherto
unwilling
to
leave
my
home
yet
i
could
delay
to
do
so
no
longer
without
absolute
ruin
staring
us
in
the
face
i
added
that
my
father
had
placed
a
sum
of
money
at
my
disposal
for
the
purposes
of
trade
with
which
if
i
met
with
the
success
i
had
reasonable
ground
to
hope
for
from
the
letters
of
my
correspondents
at
nagpoor
and
other
places
i
could
not
fail
of
realizing
a
handsome
profit
enough
to
allow
us
another
continued
enjoyment
of
peace
and
affluence
long
and
vainly
she
strove
to
overrule
my
determination
pointed
out
the
dangers
of
the
road
the
risks
to
which
i
should
be
necessarily
exposed
the
pain
my
absence
would
cause
to
her
but
finding
these
were
of
no
avail
as
i
told
her
my
plans
had
been
long
laid
and
that
i
was
even
now
expected
at
saugor
where
my
agents
had
collected
the
horses
i
was
to
take
for
sale
she
implored
me
to
take
her
and
our
children
with
me
adding
that
travelling
was
a
matter
of
no
difficulty
to
her
and
that
the
children
would
enjoy
the
change
of
scene
and
the
bustle
and
novelty
of
the
camp
but
this
also
i
overruled
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
take
her
not
to
mention
the
expense
of
her
and
at
last
after
much
pleading
and
objections
of
the
description
i
have
mentioned
she
consented
to
remain
and
placing
her
under
my
father
care
on
the
morning
we
were
to
depart
i
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
her
many
were
the
charms
and
amulets
she
bound
about
my
arms
and
hung
round
my
neck
which
she
had
purchased
from
various
wandering
fakeers
and
holy
moolas
and
with
streaming
eyes
she
placed
my
hands
upon
the
heads
of
my
children
and
bade
me
bless
them
i
did
so
fervently
and
truly
for
i
loved
them
sahib
with
a
love
as
intense
as
were
the
other
passions
of
my
nature
at
last
i
left
her
leaving
one
home
is
never
agreeable
often
painful
for
the
mind
is
oppressed
with
indistinct
visions
of
distress
to
those
one
leaves
behind
and
is
too
prone
to
imagine
sources
from
which
it
might
spring
though
in
reality
they
exist
not
it
was
thus
with
me
but
the
appearance
of
my
gallant
band
as
they
greeted
my
arrival
among
them
with
a
hearty
shout
soon
dispelled
my
vague
apprehensions
and
my
spirit
rose
when
i
found
myself
in
the
condition
which
had
been
the
object
of
many
a
fervent
aspiration
i
was
my
own
master
with
men
willing
to
obey
me
and
inshalla
i
exclaimed
to
myself
now
ameer
ali
star
is
in
the
ascendant
and
long
will
it
gleam
in
brightness
i
have
told
you
of
the
ceremonies
which
immediately
preceded
our
departure
on
a
former
occasion
of
course
they
were
repeated
on
this
the
omens
were
again
declared
to
be
favourable
by
who
was
our
and
director
of
all
our
ceremonies
as
bhudrinath
had
been
and
we
proceeded
accompanied
for
some
coss
by
my
father
and
hoosein
who
stored
my
mind
with
the
results
of
their
long
experience
among
other
things
both
particularly
urged
me
to
avoid
the
destruction
of
women
in
olden
times
said
my
father
they
were
always
spared
even
parties
in
which
there
might
by
chance
be
any
although
in
other
respects
good
bunij
were
abandoned
on
their
account
as
our
patroness
being
a
female
the
destruction
of
her
sex
was
considered
obnoxious
to
her
and
avoided
on
every
occasion
moreover
men
are
the
only
fit
prey
for
men
no
soldier
wars
with
women
no
man
of
honour
would
lift
a
finger
against
them
and
you
of
all
my
son
who
have
a
beauteous
wife
of
your
own
will
be
the
last
to
offer
violence
to
any
of
her
sex
rely
upon
me
that
i
will
not
said
i
i
was
as
you
know
strongly
against
the
fate
of
the
unhappy
women
who
died
on
my
first
expedition
and
you
will
remember
i
had
no
hand
in
their
deaths
but
i
was
overruled
in
my
objections
first
by
bhudrinath
and
afterwards
by
surfuraz
khan
and
what
could
i
do
and
it
would
be
terrible
indeed
to
think
that
the
distresses
of
their
party
and
the
unknown
fate
of
poor
bhudrinath
were
owing
to
the
tardy
but
too
sure
vengeance
of
our
patroness
it
may
be
so
said
my
father
but
let
not
that
prey
on
your
mind
both
myself
and
hoosein
have
killed
many
a
woman
in
our
time
and
as
you
know
no
ill
effects
have
resulted
from
it
but
bear
in
mind
what
i
have
said
act
with
wisdom
and
discretion
and
above
all
pay
implicit
attention
to
the
omens
and
your
success
and
protection
are
sure
we
rode
on
conversing
thus
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
of
our
village
we
dismounted
and
embraced
each
other
and
i
left
them
and
rode
on
with
my
men
according
to
our
rules
no
one
was
to
shave
or
eat
until
our
first
victim
fell
and
as
this
was
a
matter
of
inconvenience
to
many
of
the
men
you
may
be
sure
we
had
our
eyes
in
all
directions
and
our
scouts
well
occupied
in
every
village
we
passed
through
or
halted
at
but
it
was
not
till
the
fifth
day
that
we
met
with
any
one
who
offered
a
secure
and
in
every
way
eligible
sacrifice
we
had
fallen
in
with
bands
of
travellers
some
going
to
and
others
departing
from
their
homes
but
they
had
invariably
women
in
their
company
and
them
i
was
determined
to
spare
as
well
for
my
wife
sake
as
from
the
injunctions
of
my
father
however
as
i
have
said
on
the
fifth
day
early
in
the
morning
we
came
to
a
and
were
glad
to
see
a
party
of
nine
travellers
three
upon
ponies
having
the
appearance
of
respectable
men
and
the
rest
on
foot
coming
up
the
road
a
short
distance
from
us
to
our
great
joy
they
struck
into
the
road
we
were
about
to
take
we
had
halted
in
pretended
indecision
as
to
the
road
and
when
they
came
up
we
asked
it
of
them
they
readily
pointed
to
the
one
before
us
and
although
expressing
themselves
astonished
at
our
numbers
they
agreed
to
accompany
us
to
the
village
where
we
proposed
to
halt
and
the
road
to
which
we
had
inquired
of
them
i
soon
entered
into
conversation
with
the
most
respectable
of
their
party
and
i
replied
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
that
we
were
soldiers
proceeding
after
our
leave
to
hindostan
to
nagpoor
where
we
were
in
service
he
told
me
in
return
that
he
and
his
brother
one
of
the
two
others
mounted
with
a
friend
and
some
attendants
were
on
a
travelling
expedition
that
they
had
come
from
indoor
and
were
going
to
benares
as
well
for
the
purchase
of
cloths
and
brocades
as
to
visit
that
sacred
place
of
hindoo
pilgrimage
ho
ho
thought
i
these
are
assuredly
men
of
consequence
going
in
disguise
and
i
have
no
doubt
are
well
furnished
with
ready
cash
no
time
must
be
lost
as
they
have
come
by
a
and
have
not
been
seen
in
our
company
there
can
consequently
be
no
trace
by
which
we
could
possibly
be
suspected
on
their
disappearance
so
the
sooner
they
are
dealt
with
the
better
to
this
end
i
lagged
behind
a
little
and
imparted
my
determination
to
peer
khan
who
rode
in
the
rear
of
all
by
him
it
was
told
to
another
and
thus
it
circulated
throughout
the
band
before
we
had
gone
far
i
was
gratified
and
delighted
to
see
how
as
they
became
aware
of
what
was
to
be
done
each
took
his
station
three
thugs
to
each
traveller
and
the
rest
disposed
themselves
around
the
whole
so
as
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
escape
i
remembered
the
road
well
for
it
was
that
upon
which
we
had
travelled
before
and
what
thug
ever
forgets
a
road
i
knew
also
that
although
the
country
around
us
was
open
and
bare
there
was
a
river
not
far
off
the
sandy
bed
of
which
was
full
of
the
wild
cypress
and
the
bodies
could
be
easily
disposed
of
in
the
brushwood
when
we
arrived
at
the
brink
of
the
river
the
man
i
had
continued
to
converse
with
begged
for
a
short
halt
we
have
been
travelling
since
midnight
said
he
and
i
for
one
am
well
tired
and
should
be
glad
of
rest
i
made
no
objection
of
course
for
it
was
the
very
thing
i
wished
and
dismounting
and
leading
my
horse
to
the
water
i
allowed
him
to
drink
and
then
joined
the
party
which
had
all
collected
and
were
now
seated
the
travellers
discussing
a
hasty
meal
they
had
brought
with
them
and
the
thugs
sitting
or
standing
around
them
but
all
in
their
proper
places
i
was
on
the
point
of
giving
the
and
i
saw
the
bhuttotes
handling
their
roomals
in
a
significant
manner
when
thanks
to
my
quick
sense
of
hearing
i
distinguished
voices
at
a
distance
it
was
well
for
us
that
i
had
not
given
the
signal
we
should
have
been
busily
engaged
in
stripping
the
bodies
when
the
party
i
had
heard
would
have
come
upon
us
of
course
they
would
have
seen
at
a
glance
what
we
were
about
and
have
taken
the
alarm
but
our
good
destiny
saved
us
i
hesitated
as
i
have
said
and
in
a
few
minutes
fourteen
travellers
made
their
appearance
and
came
directly
up
to
where
we
were
sitting
they
were
persons
of
all
descriptions
who
had
associated
for
mutual
protection
and
i
had
half
determined
to
destroy
them
also
which
i
think
we
could
have
done
when
they
relieved
me
greatly
by
taking
their
departure
wishing
us
success
and
a
pleasant
and
safe
journey
on
one
pretence
or
another
i
delayed
our
associates
until
the
other
party
had
proceeded
far
beyond
the
risk
of
hearing
any
noise
should
there
be
any
and
now
seeing
everything
ripe
for
the
purpose
i
called
out
for
some
tobacco
the
word
we
had
agreed
to
use
as
being
least
likely
to
attract
attention
or
inspire
suspicion
i
had
planted
myself
behind
the
man
i
had
been
speaking
to
and
as
i
spoke
my
handkerchief
was
thrown
three
years
rest
had
not
affected
the
sureness
of
my
hold
and
he
lay
a
corpse
at
my
feet
in
an
instant
my
work
was
done
and
i
looked
around
to
see
the
fate
of
the
rest
one
poor
wretch
alone
struggled
but
his
sufferings
were
quickly
ended
and
the
party
was
no
more
quick
my
lads
cried
i
to
the
lughaees
quick
about
your
work
one
of
them
grinned
why
said
he
did
you
not
observe
doolum
and
four
others
go
away
to
yon
brushwood
when
we
reached
this
spot
depend
upon
it
they
have
the
grave
ready
or
they
have
been
idle
dogs
and
it
was
even
so
the
grave
had
been
dug
while
the
unsuspecting
travellers
sat
and
conversed
with
us
we
were
so
busily
engaged
in
stripping
the
dead
that
no
one
observed
the
approach
of
two
travellers
who
had
come
upon
us
unawares
never
shall
i
forget
their
horror
when
they
saw
our
occupation
they
were
rooted
to
the
spot
from
extreme
terror
they
spoke
not
but
their
eyes
glared
wildly
as
they
gazed
now
at
us
and
now
at
the
dead
miserable
men
said
i
approaching
them
prepare
for
death
you
have
been
witnesses
of
our
work
and
we
have
no
resource
but
your
destruction
for
our
own
preservation
sahib
said
one
of
them
collecting
his
energies
we
are
men
and
fear
not
to
die
since
our
hour
is
come
and
he
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
gazed
at
me
he
was
a
tall
powerful
man
well
armed
and
i
hesitated
to
attack
him
i
give
you
one
alternative
said
i
become
a
thug
and
join
our
band
you
shall
be
well
cared
for
and
you
will
prosper
never
he
exclaimed
never
shall
it
be
said
that
tilluk
sing
the
descendant
of
a
noble
race
of
rajpoots
herded
with
murderers
and
lived
on
their
unblessed
gains
no
if
i
am
to
die
let
it
be
now
ye
are
many
but
if
one
among
you
is
a
man
let
him
step
forward
and
here
on
this
even
sand
i
will
strike
one
blow
for
my
deliverance
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
stood
on
the
defensive
i
am
that
man
cried
i
though
the
band
with
one
voice
earnestly
dissuaded
me
from
the
encounter
and
declared
that
he
was
more
than
a
match
for
me
i
am
that
man
now
take
your
last
look
on
the
heavens
and
the
earth
for
by
alla
you
never
quit
this
spot
come
on
boasting
boy
he
exclaimed
give
me
but
fair
play
and
bid
none
of
your
people
interfere
and
it
may
not
be
as
you
say
hear
all
of
you
cried
i
to
them
meddle
not
in
this
matter
is
mine
and
mine
only
as
for
the
other
deal
with
him
as
ye
list
and
in
an
instant
more
he
was
numbered
with
the
dead
these
are
your
cowardly
tricks
cried
the
rajpoot
now
advancing
on
me
for
he
had
stood
contemplating
the
fate
of
his
companion
my
end
may
follow
his
but
i
shall
die
the
death
of
a
soldier
and
not
that
of
a
mangy
dog
as
he
has
done
i
have
before
told
you
sahib
that
my
skill
in
the
use
of
every
weapon
was
perfect
thanks
to
my
good
instructor
and
i
had
never
relaxed
in
those
manly
exercises
which
fit
a
man
for
active
combat
whenever
he
shall
be
called
into
it
my
sword
was
the
one
nuwab
subzee
khan
had
so
much
admired
and
i
felt
the
confidence
of
a
man
when
he
has
a
trusty
weapon
in
his
hand
and
knows
how
to
wield
it
i
have
said
that
the
rajpoot
advanced
on
me
he
had
no
shield
which
gave
me
an
immense
advantage
but
the
odds
were
in
his
favour
from
his
height
and
strength
yet
these
are
a
poor
defence
against
skill
and
temper
he
assailed
me
with
all
his
force
and
fury
blow
after
blow
i
caught
on
my
sword
and
shield
without
striking
one
myself
he
danced
round
me
after
the
fashion
of
his
people
and
now
on
one
leg
now
on
the
other
he
made
wild
gyrations
and
at
intervals
rushed
upon
me
and
literally
rained
his
blows
at
my
person
but
i
stood
fixed
to
the
spot
for
i
knew
how
soon
this
mode
of
attack
must
exhaust
him
and
the
loose
sand
of
the
river
added
to
his
fatigue
at
length
he
stood
still
and
glared
on
me
panting
for
breath
dog
of
a
kafir
cried
he
son
of
an
unchaste
mother
will
nothing
provoke
thee
to
quit
that
spot
kafir
i
exclaimed
and
son
of
a
kafir
thy
base
words
have
sealed
thy
fate
and
i
rushed
on
him
he
was
unprepared
for
my
attack
made
a
feeble
and
uncertain
blow
at
me
which
i
caught
on
my
shield
and
the
next
instant
my
sword
had
buried
itself
deep
in
his
neck
he
fell
and
the
blood
gushed
from
the
wound
and
from
his
mouth
shookur
khoda
exclaimed
peer
khan
you
have
settled
his
business
nobly
let
me
embrace
thee
and
he
folded
me
in
his
arms
the
rajpoot
was
not
dead
he
had
sufficient
strength
remaining
to
raise
himself
up
on
his
arm
and
he
looked
at
me
like
a
devil
he
made
many
attempts
to
speak
his
lips
moved
but
no
sound
followed
as
the
blood
prevented
utterance
some
of
you
put
him
out
of
his
pain
said
i
the
man
behaved
well
and
ought
not
to
suffer
peer
khan
took
my
sword
and
passed
it
through
his
heart
he
writhed
for
an
instant
and
the
breath
left
his
body
away
with
him
cried
i
we
have
loitered
too
long
already
the
lughaees
took
him
by
his
legs
and
arms
to
avoid
his
blood
and
carried
him
away
others
strewed
a
quantity
of
dry
sand
over
the
spot
where
he
had
fallen
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
we
were
pursuing
our
way
as
if
nothing
had
happened
after
this
proof
of
my
personal
courage
and
skill
i
may
safely
say
i
was
almost
adored
by
the
whole
band
they
all
assured
me
that
a
thug
having
killed
a
traveller
and
a
soldier
in
fair
open
combat
was
an
unprecedented
circumstance
and
only
required
to
be
known
to
make
me
the
envy
of
old
and
young
and
i
gloried
in
what
i
had
done
their
praise
was
sweet
incense
to
my
vanity
the
booty
we
got
from
the
merchant
and
his
brother
was
rich
and
was
of
itself
a
fair
amount
of
booty
for
any
expedition
some
were
even
for
turning
back
but
they
were
only
two
or
three
voices
and
were
easily
overruled
it
would
be
a
shame
i
said
if
while
fortune
favoured
us
we
did
not
take
advantage
of
our
good
luck
sahib
we
continued
our
march
and
when
we
had
reached
saugor
we
had
killed
nineteen
other
travellers
without
however
having
obtained
much
plunder
ten
fifteen
and
on
one
occasion
only
nearly
a
hundred
rupees
were
as
much
as
any
of
them
afforded
us
the
town
of
saugor
was
and
is
now
a
large
and
busy
place
built
on
the
edge
of
an
immense
lake
nearly
as
large
as
that
of
the
hoosein
sagor
the
cooling
breezes
which
travel
over
it
make
it
a
delightful
spot
we
encamped
on
the
border
of
the
lake
near
the
town
for
the
four
days
we
remained
there
we
daily
perambulated
the
bazars
and
frequented
the
shops
of
bhuttearas
one
of
whom
was
well
known
to
peer
khan
and
whom
we
paid
handsomely
for
information
he
promised
to
be
on
the
for
us
and
on
the
third
day
after
our
arrival
peer
khan
came
to
me
in
the
evening
as
i
sat
before
the
entrance
of
my
little
tent
smoking
and
enjoying
the
delightful
breeze
which
came
over
the
vast
sheet
of
water
spread
before
me
meer
sahib
said
he
the
bhutteara
is
faithful
he
has
got
news
of
a
sahoukar
going
our
road
who
is
to
leave
this
place
in
about
a
week
he
says
we
are
certain
of
him
but
that
we
must
quit
this
spot
and
march
about
within
a
few
coss
of
the
town
leaving
two
or
three
men
with
him
to
carry
information
cried
i
he
is
a
worthy
man
we
will
listen
to
his
advice
and
be
off
early
three
of
the
best
runners
shall
stay
here
as
he
counsels
to
bring
us
the
news
but
he
stipulates
for
a
large
reward
in
case
we
are
successful
i
see
nothing
against
it
said
i
he
will
be
worthy
of
it
if
he
is
true
to
his
word
oh
for
that
you
need
not
fear
he
is
faithful
so
long
as
you
pay
him
then
he
shall
have
it
how
much
does
he
want
two
hundred
rupees
if
we
get
five
thousand
he
replied
double
if
we
get
ten
and
in
proportion
if
between
one
and
the
other
if
the
sahoukar
is
rich
khan
said
i
we
can
well
spare
what
he
asks
so
go
and
tell
him
he
shall
have
it
i
go
he
said
should
i
not
return
conclude
that
i
have
stayed
with
him
he
sought
out
the
men
he
required
to
accompany
him
and
taking
them
and
a
small
bundle
of
clothes
with
him
i
watched
him
far
beyond
the
precincts
of
our
camp
on
his
way
to
the
town
chapter
xxvii
we
travelled
from
village
to
village
for
four
days
meeting
with
no
adventure
and
in
truth
i
was
beginning
to
be
weary
of
the
delay
and
inactivity
when
on
the
fifth
morning
one
of
the
men
we
had
left
behind
to
bring
information
arrived
peer
khan
sahib
sends
his
salam
said
he
and
requests
you
will
return
immediately
as
the
bunij
has
been
secured
and
is
about
to
leave
the
city
know
you
aught
of
who
he
is
no
i
do
not
meer
sahib
i
lived
at
the
bhutteara
and
he
and
the
jemadar
were
often
in
earnest
conversation
about
him
but
i
was
not
let
into
the
secret
is
well
i
replied
refresh
yourself
and
be
ready
to
accompany
us
how
far
are
we
from
saugor
by
the
way
i
came
about
fourteen
coss
said
he
but
by
a
path
which
i
know
the
city
is
not
more
than
half
the
distance
then
we
may
be
there
by
evening
certainly
by
noon
if
you
please
and
i
will
conduct
you
now
accordingly
guided
by
him
through
a
wild
track
which
i
should
never
have
found
alone
we
reached
saugor
towards
evening
and
after
occupying
our
former
ground
i
hurried
to
the
bhutteara
where
i
was
pretty
sure
of
meeting
my
friends
peer
khan
was
there
and
welcomed
me
i
was
fearful
the
messenger
would
miss
you
said
he
but
praise
to
alla
you
are
come
and
this
is
our
worthy
ally
i
suppose
said
i
making
a
salutation
to
the
bhutteara
the
same
he
answered
your
poor
slave
peroo
is
always
happy
when
he
can
serve
his
good
friends
i
have
not
forgotten
what
you
are
to
get
my
friend
said
i
and
you
may
depend
on
the
word
of
a
true
thug
for
it
are
we
sure
of
the
man
as
sure
said
peer
khan
as
of
those
who
have
hitherto
fallen
he
will
take
his
last
look
on
saugor
i
exclaimed
so
much
the
better
and
he
will
be
a
good
bunij
you
think
he
will
be
worth
seven
or
eight
thousand
good
rupees
to
you
said
the
bhutteara
and
all
ready
money
too
good
again
friend
but
why
do
you
not
take
to
the
road
you
are
a
likely
fellow
enough
oh
i
have
tried
it
already
said
he
laughing
i
was
out
on
two
expeditions
with
ganesha
jemadar
do
you
know
him
i
have
heard
of
him
i
replied
he
is
a
leader
of
note
he
is
said
the
bhutteara
but
he
is
a
cruel
dog
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
fear
you
will
think
me
a
coward
for
it
i
did
not
like
the
way
he
treated
the
poor
people
he
fell
in
with
so
i
quitted
active
work
and
only
do
a
little
business
as
you
see
now
by
which
i
pick
up
a
trifle
now
and
then
well
said
i
you
do
good
it
appears
but
beware
how
you
act
and
see
that
you
do
not
bully
poor
thugs
out
of
their
money
by
threatening
to
denounce
them
the
fellow
winced
a
little
at
my
observation
but
recovering
himself
stoutly
protested
he
had
never
been
guilty
of
so
base
an
act
peer
khan
threw
me
a
sly
look
as
much
as
to
say
you
have
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
but
i
did
not
press
the
matter
further
for
we
were
completely
in
his
power
then
said
i
we
start
in
the
morning
i
suppose
do
so
replied
the
man
the
sahoukar
goes
to
jubbulpoor
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
show
yourselves
for
some
days
as
he
might
take
the
alarm
and
some
people
of
note
have
disappeared
of
late
on
the
road
now
said
i
to
peer
khan
we
have
no
further
business
here
and
i
am
tired
let
us
go
to
the
camp
we
can
send
two
scouts
to
remain
here
to
give
us
intelligence
of
the
sahoukar
departure
if
necessary
the
men
were
instructed
in
what
they
had
to
do
and
we
left
them
and
the
bhutteara
you
probed
that
rascal
deeply
by
what
you
said
said
peer
khan
as
we
walked
along
it
is
the
very
practice
by
which
he
gets
his
money
the
fellow
is
as
rich
as
a
sahoukar
by
this
means
and
never
omits
to
levy
a
contribution
on
every
gang
which
passes
saugor
then
said
i
my
mind
is
made
up
as
to
his
fate
such
a
wretch
is
not
fit
to
live
a
cowardly
rascal
who
sits
at
his
ease
runs
no
risk
undergoes
no
fatigue
and
yet
gets
the
largest
share
of
any
one
he
ought
to
die
what
say
you
to
putting
him
to
death
it
is
a
rare
plan
replied
he
but
how
to
get
him
out
of
the
town
i
know
not
he
is
as
wary
as
a
fox
oh
said
i
that
is
more
easily
managed
than
you
think
the
kafir
is
fond
of
money
as
fond
as
he
is
of
his
own
miserable
existence
then
peer
khan
we
have
him
directly
we
get
to
the
camp
i
will
send
a
man
with
a
message
which
you
shall
hear
me
deliver
and
if
it
does
not
bring
him
call
ameer
ali
a
father
and
grandfather
of
jackasses
good
said
he
laughing
we
will
see
this
rare
plan
of
yours
but
i
tell
you
the
villain
is
most
wary
i
never
knew
him
come
out
except
in
broad
daylight
when
there
was
no
danger
and
then
only
to
small
parties
here
junglee
said
i
to
a
smart
young
fellow
who
always
attended
my
person
you
know
peroo
the
bhutteara
certainly
my
lord
was
with
him
this
afternoon
i
know
his
house
for
i
was
in
the
bazar
purchasing
some
flour
and
saw
my
lord
at
the
shop
good
said
i
then
you
will
have
no
need
to
inquire
for
it
now
go
to
the
bhutteara
and
take
my
with
you
mind
you
do
let
it
go
out
of
your
hand
tell
him
with
many
compliments
from
me
that
as
we
are
so
sure
by
his
kindness
of
the
bunij
in
prospect
and
have
some
money
with
us
i
will
pay
him
what
he
asks
if
he
will
come
here
to
receive
it
say
that
i
do
so
as
our
return
by
this
road
is
uncertain
and
may
be
at
a
distant
period
and
that
i
shall
have
no
means
of
sending
him
the
coin
and
add
that
i
do
this
favour
to
him
as
i
am
convinced
of
his
good
faith
and
have
placed
implicit
reliance
in
his
assertions
now
can
you
remember
all
this
mind
you
speak
to
him
in
ramasee
he
understands
it
certainly
said
the
lad
i
know
all
and
he
repeated
what
i
had
told
him
word
for
word
that
will
do
said
i
and
here
is
the
ring
now
be
off
run
fly
and
let
us
see
how
soon
you
will
earn
two
rupees
i
am
gone
jemadar
sahib
cried
he
joyfully
i
will
be
back
instantly
that
is
a
sharp
lad
said
peer
khan
he
takes
one
meaning
so
readily
but
oh
meer
sahib
peroo
will
never
come
for
that
message
he
is
too
old
a
bird
to
be
caught
with
chaff
depend
on
it
he
will
he
will
hear
the
tinkling
of
the
silver
and
will
run
to
it
as
ever
lover
did
to
his
mistress
signal
besides
he
has
no
chaff
in
prospect
but
rupees
man
rupees
the
fellow
would
run
to
delhi
for
as
much
we
shall
see
said
peer
khan
if
it
be
written
in
his
fate
that
he
is
to
come
why
alla
help
him
come
he
must
there
is
no
avoiding
destiny
what
peroo
the
bhutteara
come
out
of
his
house
at
night
to
visit
thugs
i
say
the
thing
is
impossible
it
has
often
been
tried
and
failed
utterly
the
fellow
laughed
at
them
as
well
he
might
for
all
your
doubts
khan
said
i
inshalla
we
will
throw
earth
on
his
beard
and
as
we
may
as
well
be
ready
call
motee
and
two
or
three
lughaees
the
grave
must
be
dug
and
that
immediately
motee
came
but
was
as
desponding
of
success
as
peer
khan
you
will
never
take
him
he
said
did
not
ganesha
offer
to
divide
a
large
booty
here
last
year
and
that
peroo
should
have
a
share
if
he
would
come
to
take
it
and
he
sent
word
that
he
laughed
at
our
beards
and
we
had
better
leave
his
share
in
the
hollow
of
an
old
tree
known
to
us
or
he
would
send
the
whole
police
of
saugor
after
us
in
the
morning
and
so
you
left
the
share
we
did
and
it
was
a
good
one
too
then
ganesha
was
an
owl
and
i
will
tell
him
so
if
i
ever
meet
him
peroo
should
not
have
had
a
cowree
from
me
nor
will
he
now
unless
he
comes
to
take
it
we
were
silent
for
some
time
and
i
could
hear
the
dull
blows
of
the
pickaxe
as
the
sound
was
borne
by
the
chill
from
the
place
where
the
grave
was
preparing
he
will
come
thought
i
and
his
iniquity
will
be
ended
shame
on
the
coward
who
can
sell
men
lives
as
he
does
without
striking
a
blow
against
them
as
i
was
thus
musing
our
messenger
was
seen
in
the
dusky
light
returning
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
alone
we
told
you
so
cried
both
my
associates
triumphantly
we
told
you
how
it
would
be
i
was
vexed
and
bit
my
lips
to
conceal
my
chagrin
let
us
hear
what
he
says
at
any
rate
said
i
well
what
news
junglee
cried
i
as
he
ran
up
quite
out
of
breath
wait
a
moment
jemadar
said
he
till
i
can
speak
i
have
run
hard
here
drink
some
water
it
will
compose
you
what
has
happened
is
there
any
alarm
ah
no
alarm
replied
the
lad
but
listen
i
went
as
fast
as
i
could
without
running
for
i
thought
if
i
appeared
out
of
breath
when
i
reached
him
he
might
suspect
something
so
when
i
got
to
the
town
gate
i
walked
slowly
till
i
reached
his
shop
he
was
busy
frying
kabobs
for
some
travellers
and
told
me
to
go
into
his
private
room
and
wait
for
him
in
a
short
time
he
came
to
me
said
he
news
why
have
you
come
the
bunij
is
safe
it
was
but
just
now
that
one
of
your
scouts
came
and
said
he
had
heard
orders
given
for
his
departure
what
do
you
want
so
i
repeated
your
message
word
for
word
as
you
delivered
it
to
me
and
he
seemed
much
agitated
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
some
time
talking
to
himself
and
i
could
hear
the
words
once
or
twice
repeated
so
at
last
i
grew
tired
of
this
and
said
to
him
can
not
wait
i
have
orders
to
return
immediately
will
you
come
or
not
and
this
stopped
him
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
me
severely
me
said
he
man
was
present
when
this
message
was
delivered
he
was
not
i
replied
he
know
it
he
had
not
returned
from
the
town
when
i
received
it
at
any
rate
neither
i
nor
the
jemadar
sahib
saw
him
peer
khan
present
said
i
stoutly
was
not
he
left
this
place
in
company
with
your
master
may
have
done
so
said
i
i
did
not
see
him
i
was
preparing
the
jemadar
bedding
when
he
returned
and
the
message
was
delivered
to
me
privately
for
after
he
lay
down
to
rest
he
called
to
me
and
delivered
it
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
he
counted
out
the
money
from
a
bag
which
was
under
his
pillow
much
was
there
set
apart
for
me
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
he
was
counting
more
but
he
stopped
short
put
the
rest
into
the
bag
and
said
it
would
be
enough
how
much
is
in
the
bag
maloom
said
i
should
i
know
anything
about
it
sleep
in
the
tent
with
the
jemadar
he
asked
after
another
silence
and
a
few
more
turns
about
the
room
one
said
i
sleep
across
the
doorway
but
no
one
is
ever
allowed
to
enter
are
a
good
lad
he
rejoined
a
smart
fellow
how
should
you
like
to
be
a
bhutteara
enough
said
i
for
i
wanted
to
see
what
he
was
driving
at
and
i
suspected
no
good
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
rascal
said
peer
khan
oh
if
we
only
had
him
i
would
wring
the
base
neck
off
his
shoulders
let
him
go
on
said
i
do
interrupt
him
well
continued
junglee
he
paced
to
and
fro
again
several
times
and
at
last
came
and
sat
by
me
and
took
my
hand
in
his
i
did
not
like
it
so
i
laid
my
other
on
the
hilt
of
my
dagger
which
was
concealed
in
my
waistband
said
he
to
me
art
a
good
lad
and
may
be
to
me
a
son
if
thou
wilt
aid
me
in
this
matter
young
as
thou
art
this
bloody
trade
can
have
no
charms
for
thee
besides
i
warrant
your
jemadar
does
not
make
a
pet
of
you
as
i
would
and
obliges
you
to
work
hard
i
nodded
it
is
even
so
said
he
thou
wouldst
be
free
speak
boy
and
fear
not
thou
shalt
be
a
son
to
me
alla
help
me
i
have
neither
wife
nor
child
i
nodded
again
is
right
continued
he
you
are
ill
used
you
do
not
like
to
abuse
the
salt
you
have
eaten
and
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
now
listen
to
me
i
will
come
but
not
now
you
say
you
lie
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
good
you
must
sleep
as
sound
as
if
you
had
taken
opium
do
you
hear
i
shall
step
quietly
over
you
and
i
know
an
old
trick
of
tickling
with
a
straw
do
you
understand
do
said
i
would
have
the
large
bag
so
my
son
said
he
have
guessed
rightly
trust
me
i
will
have
it
as
i
go
away
i
will
touch
you
you
need
not
follow
me
then
but
you
can
watch
your
opportunity
the
scouts
added
i
have
not
thought
of
them
i
can
easily
avoid
them
the
night
is
dark
and
cloudy
and
no
one
will
see
me
i
shall
strip
myself
naked
and
throw
a
black
blanket
over
me
i
agree
said
i
i
will
quit
those
horrid
people
and
become
an
honest
man
now
what
am
i
to
say
to
the
jemadar
replied
he
the
herdsman
flock
has
often
been
robbed
by
the
wolf
of
its
fattest
sheep
and
the
herdsman
said
to
himself
i
will
catch
the
wolf
and
put
him
to
death
and
he
dug
a
hole
and
suspended
a
fat
lamb
over
it
in
a
basket
and
sat
and
watched
and
the
wolf
came
and
saw
from
afar
off
that
there
was
something
unusual
in
the
generosity
of
the
herdsman
and
he
said
to
himself
wolf
thou
art
hungry
but
why
should
one
lamb
tempt
thee
the
time
will
come
when
thou
mayest
find
the
herdsman
asleep
so
wait
although
thy
stomach
is
empty
say
this
to
the
jemadar
and
he
will
understand
thee
by
alla
thou
hast
done
well
junglee
said
i
and
thy
faithfulness
shall
surely
be
well
rewarded
what
think
you
my
friends
of
this
villain
ah
we
are
not
astonished
cried
both
it
is
just
like
him
but
inshalla
he
will
fall
into
his
own
snare
now
said
i
call
two
of
the
scouts
and
they
came
after
i
had
told
them
of
the
plot
peeroo
had
formed
my
friends
i
continued
you
must
allow
this
rascal
to
come
into
the
camp
one
of
you
lie
down
close
to
my
tent
and
pretend
to
be
asleep
but
have
your
eyes
open
and
directly
you
see
him
enter
rouse
peer
khan
and
motee
and
bring
them
to
the
entrance
and
do
you
two
then
place
yourselves
one
on
each
side
of
the
door
so
that
he
can
not
see
you
i
shall
feign
to
be
asleep
and
shall
let
him
take
the
bag
though
he
should
even
fall
over
me
in
doing
so
as
he
comes
out
you
can
seize
him
and
hold
him
fast
do
him
no
harm
till
i
come
and
as
for
you
junglee
if
you
do
not
sleep
as
sound
as
though
a
seer
of
opium
was
in
your
stomach
i
swear
by
alla
you
shall
lie
in
the
same
grave
with
him
do
not
fear
me
said
the
lad
i
have
eaten
your
salt
you
are
my
father
and
my
mother
you
have
treated
me
kindly
and
how
could
i
deceive
you
had
i
intended
it
i
had
not
mentioned
a
word
of
what
he
told
me
then
we
are
all
prepared
said
i
did
he
say
when
he
would
come
he
did
said
junglee
in
the
second
watch
of
the
night
when
he
had
no
more
business
good
then
mind
you
are
all
ready
and
we
will
spit
on
his
beard
anxiously
to
me
did
the
hours
pass
till
the
time
came
when
i
might
expect
him
i
went
out
of
my
little
tent
repeatedly
to
see
that
all
were
at
their
proper
posts
and
returned
as
often
satisfied
that
they
were
peer
khan
was
lying
near
my
tent
apparently
in
a
sound
sleep
but
i
knew
he
was
awake
the
scouts
were
wandering
lazily
about
above
all
the
night
was
so
dark
that
i
could
not
see
my
hand
before
me
and
the
splashing
and
murmuring
of
the
tiny
waves
of
the
lake
upon
the
shore
would
prevent
any
noise
of
his
footsteps
being
heard
yes
i
said
half
aloud
as
i
retired
to
my
carpet
for
the
last
time
he
will
come
thief
as
he
is
he
will
not
miss
such
a
night
as
this
but
the
darkness
favours
us
as
much
as
it
does
him
now
junglee
said
i
this
is
the
last
time
i
stir
out
mind
your
watch
my
good
lad
and
i
will
not
forget
you
peer
khan
is
close
at
the
back
of
the
tent
i
care
not
much
about
the
rest
they
will
soon
be
collected
when
he
is
caught
do
not
fear
me
said
the
boy
my
eyes
are
not
heavy
with
sleep
and
when
i
move
from
this
spot
to
call
peer
khan
a
rat
will
not
hear
me
i
went
in
and
lay
down
i
drew
my
trusty
blade
and
laid
it
close
to
my
right
hand
so
that
i
could
grasp
it
in
a
moment
and
covering
myself
up
with
my
quilt
as
well
to
hide
it
as
to
assure
me
when
he
came
for
i
knew
he
would
endeavour
to
pull
it
off
me
i
continued
to
stare
steadfastly
on
the
entrance
of
the
tent
and
my
eyes
becoming
sensible
of
the
greater
darkness
of
the
inside
than
of
the
outside
i
was
certain
that
if
any
one
entered
or
even
passed
the
door
i
should
see
him
long
long
did
i
lie
in
this
position
i
hardly
stirred
lest
peeroo
should
be
outside
listening
whether
i
was
awake
it
was
now
i
guessed
considerably
past
midnight
still
no
one
came
and
i
should
have
been
inclined
to
despair
did
i
not
feel
certain
that
his
fate
would
lead
him
to
destruction
why
is
it
sahib
that
one
has
these
presentiments
i
have
often
felt
them
during
my
lifetime
but
i
never
could
account
for
them
at
last
he
came
i
saw
an
object
darken
the
doorway
hesitate
for
a
moment
and
then
pass
in
over
the
body
of
junglee
who
snored
so
loudly
and
naturally
that
i
could
have
declared
he
was
asleep
had
i
not
known
the
contrary
by
having
spoken
to
him
a
short
time
before
alla
alla
sahib
how
my
heart
beat
i
could
hear
its
throbbings
and
they
seemed
to
be
so
loud
in
my
breast
that
i
thought
he
would
hear
them
too
another
thought
flashed
across
me
could
he
be
armed
and
would
he
attempt
to
destroy
me
it
might
be
and
i
almost
trembled
as
i
thought
how
i
was
to
lie
inactive
and
in
his
power
while
he
abstracted
the
bag
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaping
up
and
passing
my
weapon
through
his
body
but
i
dismissed
the
idea
he
is
a
thief
a
miserable
thief
and
has
not
courage
to
bring
a
weapon
much
less
to
use
it
and
he
will
want
both
his
hands
too
he
can
not
have
one
so
i
lay
quiet
with
my
hands
on
the
hilt
of
my
sword
the
tent
was
very
low
and
he
was
obliged
to
advance
stooping
he
reached
my
side
and
knelt
down
and
as
i
feigned
the
hard
breathing
of
sleep
i
felt
his
warm
breath
when
he
looked
over
me
and
into
my
eyes
to
see
whether
i
really
slept
or
not
he
appeared
satisfied
that
i
did
for
he
instantly
thrust
his
hand
under
the
pillow
but
so
quietly
that
i
could
not
have
felt
it
had
i
been
asleep
but
the
bag
was
not
on
that
side
it
was
under
my
other
ear
he
felt
it
but
found
i
suppose
that
he
could
not
abstract
it
without
his
awakening
me
so
he
felt
about
on
the
ground
for
a
piece
of
straw
or
a
blade
of
grass
and
began
tickling
my
ear
on
the
side
next
to
him
i
obeyed
the
intention
of
the
action
and
turned
towards
him
with
a
grunt
it
startled
him
and
he
was
still
for
a
moment
but
again
his
hand
was
groping
i
felt
the
bag
recede
recede
till
it
was
withdrawn
from
the
pillow
i
heard
the
clink
of
the
money
as
he
placed
it
on
his
shoulder
and
i
was
content
i
saw
too
that
junglee
was
not
at
the
door
though
when
he
had
gone
i
know
not
having
been
too
much
occupied
by
my
own
situation
and
that
the
bhutteara
was
aware
of
it
he
stopped
and
murmured
in
a
low
tone
strange
that
he
should
be
gone
but
he
knows
the
way
and
will
not
disappoint
me
another
step
and
he
was
beyond
the
threshold
and
in
the
rough
grasp
of
peer
khan
motee
and
a
dozen
others
capitally
managed
cried
i
as
i
ran
to
the
door
and
joined
the
group

the
wolf
who

so
wary

fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
shepherds
at
last
he
would
not
take
the
little
bait
but
the
large
flock

well
watched

he

others
you

thousands
of
rupees
which
you
have
bullied
poor
thugs
out
of
we
could
name
a
hundred
instances
in
which
you
have
taken
money
from
us
how
dare
you
deny
it
look
here
said
i
here

the
roomal
and
you

the
use

it
say
whether

said
he
i
will

pickaxe

said
i
and
be
taken
too
ourselves
no
no

bhutteara

try
to
throw
dust
on
our
beards
after
that
fashion
inshalla
the
people
who
could
catch
you
have
sharper
wits
than
you
seemed
to
give
them
credit
for
no
man
i
was
but
joking
with
thee
where
is
all
thy
wealth
concealed
you
may
kill
me
if
you
will
said
he
but
i
give
no
answer
to
that
question
ah
well
cried
i
you
may
think
better
of
it
when
you
are
choking
now
you
two
hold
him
fast
and
take
the
bag
off
his
shoulders
they
did
so
i
threw
the
roomal
about
his
neck
and
tightened
it
till
he
was
almost
choked
he
made
several
attempts
to
speak
and
at
last
i
relaxed
my
hold
a
little
but
he
could
not
utter
a
word
fear
of
death
had
paralyzed
his
powers
of
utterance
give
him
some
water
said
i
it
will
wash
down
his
fright
he
took
it
and
fell
at
my
feet
and
implored
me
to
spare
him
i
spurned
and
kicked
him
where
is
the
treasure
i
said
you
have
felt
the
tightening
of
the
roomal
once
beware
how
you
risk
it
again
where
is
the
treasure
promise
to
let
me
live
and
i
will
tell
cried
the
bhutteara
trembling
in
every
limb
i
will
promise
said
i
you
shall
remain
here
and
i
will
send
people
to
bring
it
you
well
know
we
have
no
time
for
delay
and
if
you
trifle
with
us
you
know
the
result
you
have
already
half
felt
it
where
is
he
knows
the
spot
liar
i
know
it
not
cried
motee
stepping
forward
do
you
wish
to
make
me
out
to
be
a
participator
in
your
base
gains
you
know
the
spot
continued
the
bhutteara
but
you
do
not
know
that
there
is
aught
there
you
remember
the
old
hollow
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
where
you
left
the
last
share
i
got
from
ganesha
i
do
well
then
you
must
dig
in
the
hollow
of
the
trunk
about
a
cubit
deep
you
will
find
all
i
have
gold
silver
and
ornaments
now
said
i
villain
i
have
kept
my
word
you
remain
here
the
grave
is
dug
which
shall
hold
thee
and
has
been
ready
for
hours
i
swore
that
i
would
spit
on
thy
beard
before
morning
and
bhowanee
whose
votaries
thou
hast
bullied
and
threatened
has
delivered
thee
into
my
hands
and
i
spat
on
him
all
the
men
who
were
near
me
did
the
same
again
cried
i
hold
him
fast
and
bring
the
tobacco
he
knew
the
fatal
jhirnee
and
struggled
to
be
free
but
he
was
a
child
in
the
power
of
those
who
held
him
in
an
instant
more
he
was
dead
off
with
you
motee
cried
i
take
ten
men
and
go
to
the
spot
he
mentioned
he
may
have
told
the
truth
and
we
shall
be
the
richer
for
it
then
will
many
a
man
cry
wah
when
he
hears
of
this
deed
the
body
was
taken
away
and
buried
the
grave
was
smoothed
over
and
beaten
down
the
place
plastered
over
some
made
and
fires
lighted
to
blacken
them
and
our
work
was
concealed
now
did
not
that
villain
deserve
his
fate
sahib
to
my
perception
his
work
was
far
worse
than
our
legitimate
proceedings
and
as
for
his
treachery
he
paid
the
forfeit
of
it
it
was
a
fearful
revenge
said
i
but
you
spoilt
the
justice
of
it
by
your
vile
love
of
plunder
why
should
you
have
promised
him
his
life
and
then
have
murdered
him
that
was
base
i
did
not
promise
it
to
him
i
said
he
should
remain
where
he
was
and
he
did
remain
ay
he
is
there
now
it
was
a
nice
distinction
certainly
ameer
ali
and
only
shows
the
more
how
little
you
are
to
be
trusted
but
how
did
you
get
on
afterwards
had
he
told
the
truth
about
his
money
he
had
replied
the
thug
long
before
morning
motee
returned
and
rousing
me
poured
at
my
feet
a
heap
of
gold
and
silver
coins
necklaces
armlets
bracelets
and
anklets
they
were
worth
nearly
three
thousand
rupees
and
not
one
article
of
them
was
there
but
had
been
given
him
by
thugs
motee
peer
khan
and
others
recognised
most
of
the
property
we
melted
all
the
ornaments
and
divided
the
whole
at
our
next
stage
and
it
was
a
good
booty
and
enriched
us
for
a
long
time
indeed
i
may
say
it
lasted
till
our
return
home
and
the
sahoukar
i
asked
was
the
news
true
about
him
oh
quite
true
said
ameer
ali
i
will
tell
you
of
him
we
left
saugor
early
and
at
a
short
distance
on
the
road
sat
down
to
eat
the
goor
as
is
usual
with
us
after
any
adventure
while
we
were
thus
employed
one
of
the
scouts
came
up
and
told
us
the
joyful
news
that
the
sahoukar
had
left
the
town
and
was
close
behind
us
and
that
the
other
whose
name
was
bhikaree
had
taken
service
with
him
as
far
as
jubbulpoor
as
an
attendant
to
watch
at
night
while
the
sahoukar
slept
and
how
does
he
travel
i
asked
he
is
on
a
tattoo
a
good
strong
beast
said
the
scout
and
has
two
others
laden
with
him
and
there
are
four
men
besides
himself
and
bhikaree
good
said
i
now
my
lads
we
must
push
on
the
sahoukar
must
see
nothing
of
us
for
some
days
and
till
then
i
shall
avoid
all
others
we
hastened
on
and
got
to
the
end
of
our
stage
three
days
we
travelled
quietly
and
from
time
to
time
observed
the
omens
they
were
all
favourable
and
cheered
us
on
on
the
fourth
as
if
by
accident
we
contrived
to
fall
in
with
the
sahoukar
and
his
people
our
faithful
bhikaree
we
rejoiced
to
see
in
his
train
it
was
in
the
road
that
we
met
with
him
or
rather
allowed
him
to
overtake
us
and
the
usual
salutations
passed
i
was
well
dressed
and
well
mounted
and
looked
a
soldier
he
inquired
our
destination
and
business
to
which
the
old
story
was
answered
and
we
proceeded
merrily
along
the
sahoukar
was
a
fat
jolly
fellow
and
witty
in
his
way
and
stories
were
interchanged
and
we
all
laughed
heartily
at
his
jokes
it
is
astonishing
sahib
how
soon
these
trifles
engender
good
will
and
friendship
among
travellers
the
loneliness
of
the
road
and
the
weariness
of
the
stage
are
forgotten
in
such
pleasant
conversation
and
before
we
had
reached
the
end
of
the
stage
we
were
as
great
friends
as
though
we
had
travelled
together
for
months
or
known
each
other
for
years
a
kind
farewell
was
interchanged
as
we
parted
at
the
village
he
to
put
up
inside
it
in
the
bazar
and
we
to
our
old
plan
of
encampment
said
i
to
the
assembled
men
is
a
good
day
it
is
friday
we
must
finish
this
business
all
were
agreed
upon
it
and
at
midnight
the
bélhas
and
lughaees
went
on
the
former
to
choose
a
spot
for
the
affair
and
the
latter
to
dig
the
grave
at
daylight
a
man
our
bhikaree
it
was
came
to
say
the
sahoukar
would
wait
for
us
at
the
other
side
of
the
village
and
begged
we
would
be
quick
as
he
liked
our
company
and
wished
for
the
safety
of
our
escort
i
have
been
frightening
him
a
little
continued
he
and
in
truth
he
has
been
in
alarm
ever
since
he
left
saugor
for
he
had
heard
of
the
disappearance
of
some
parties
on
the
road
last
year
so
when
we
met
you
yesterday
he
was
highly
delighted
and
afterwards
spoke
warmly
of
you
jemadar
sahib
and
said
he
could
feel
no
fear
in
your
society
well
done
cried
i
thou
too
hast
played
thy
part
well
and
it
shall
not
be
forgotten
but
my
friends
the
sahoukar
waits
and
we
had
better
be
moving
do
you
all
surround
his
party
as
you
did
yesterday
ply
them
with
tales
and
stories
and
keep
their
minds
quiet
jey
bhowanee
jey
ameer
ali
was
the
shout
of
the
party
as
we
quitted
the
ground
and
took
our
way
to
the
spot
where
the
sahoukar
awaited
us
chapter
xxviii
ram
ram
meer
sahib
was
the
salutation
of
the
sahoukar
as
we
met
at
the
spot
whither
bhikaree
had
guided
us
ram
ram
i
am
glad
you
have
condescended
to
keep
company
with
your
poor
servant
for
truly
the
sweet
savour
of
your
fluent
discourse
has
left
a
longing
in
my
heart
to
hear
more
of
it
and
happily
i
am
so
far
favoured
i
returned
the
usual
compliments
and
we
set
forward
on
our
journey
gradually
my
band
arranged
themselves
around
their
new
victims
all
were
at
their
places
and
i
eagerly
looked
out
for
the
first
scout
who
should
give
us
intelligence
that
the
bhil
was
ready
a
strange
feeling
it
is
sahib
that
comes
over
us
thugs
at
such
moments
not
a
feeling
of
interest
or
pity
for
our
victims
or
compunction
for
the
deed
we
are
about
to
do
as
perhaps
you
might
expect
to
hear
but
an
anxiety
for
the
issue
of
the
adventure
an
intense
longing
for
its
consummation
and
a
dread
of
interruption
from
passing
travellers
and
though
i
had
become
now
callous
in
a
great
measure
still
my
heart
was
throbbing
with
anxiety
and
apprehension
and
my
replies
to
the
sahoukar
witty
and
jolly
remarks
were
vague
and
abstracted
my
whole
thoughts
were
concentrated
upon
the
affair
in
hand
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
he
remarked
my
altered
behaviour
and
i
rallied
myself
and
was
soon
able
to
amuse
him
as
i
had
done
before
ah
that
is
like
yourself
meer
sahib
said
he
as
i
had
just
given
utterance
to
a
joke
which
caused
his
fat
sides
to
shake
that
is
like
yourself
why
man
whose
face
did
your
first
glance
on
awaking
from
sleep
rest
on
surely
on
some
melancholy
being
and
you
have
partaken
of
his
thoughts
ever
since
i
know
not
séthjee
i
replied
but
you
know
that
a
man
can
not
always
command
the
same
evenness
of
temper
and
i
confess
that
my
thoughts
were
far
away
at
my
home
well
said
he
all
i
wish
for
you
and
myself
is
a
safe
return
to
our
homes
for
this
travelling
is
poor
work
and
i
have
been
unlucky
enough
to
start
on
a
very
indifferent
day
after
all
my
waiting
i
had
determined
on
leaving
saugor
nearly
a
month
ago
but
on
consulting
the
astrologer
he
delayed
me
from
time
to
time
declaring
this
day
was
bad
and
that
day
was
worse
until
i
could
stay
no
longer
and
it
was
all
to
little
purpose
and
i
pray
naraynu
to
protect
me
and
you
from
all
thugs
thieves
and
dacoos
ameen
said
i
i
respond
to
your
prayer
most
fervently
for
i
am
on
my
way
to
my
service
where
we
chance
often
to
get
harder
knocks
than
we
can
bear
but
do
they
say
there
are
thugs
on
the
road
and
who
or
what
are
they
the
term
is
new
to
me
why
truly
i
can
hardly
tell
you
meer
sahib
the
thugs
they
say
are
people
who
feign
one
thing
or
other
till
they
get
unwary
travellers
into
their
power
and
then
destroy
them
i
have
heard
too
that
they
have
handsome
women
with
them
who
pretend
distress
on
the
roads
and
decoy
travellers
who
may
have
soft
hearts
to
help
them
then
they
fasten
on
them
and
they
have
some
charm
from
the
shitan
which
enables
them
to
keep
their
hold
till
their
associates
come
up
despite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
person
so
ensnared
to
gain
his
liberty
and
that
either
thieves
or
thugs
or
rascals
of
some
kind
or
other
do
infest
the
highways
is
most
true
for
many
travellers
disappear
in
an
unaccountable
manner
but
i
do
not
fear
i
am
in
the
company
of
honest
men
and
we
are
a
large
party
and
they
must
be
stout
men
or
devils
who
would
assail
us
i
laughed
inwardly
at
the
sahoukar
idea
of
thugs
and
had
no
doubt
that
ganesha
jemadar
was
if
the
truth
were
known
at
the
bottom
of
the
disappearance
of
the
travellers
but
i
answered
gaily
ah
no
fear
my
friend
these
thugs
as
you
say
may
now
and
then
light
upon
an
unsuspecting
single
traveller
and
kill
him
but
no
one
would
dare
to
touch
a
party
like
ours
and
inshalla
if
any
appear
we
will
let
daylight
into
some
of
their
skins
there
is
nothing
i
love
better
than
making
keema
mincemeat
of
these
rascals
i
have
done
so
once
or
twice
already
and
i
never
found
them
stand
when
a
sword
was
drawn
but
yonder
i
see
is
one
of
my
men
sitting
i
wonder
how
he
got
on
before
us
i
will
ask
him
he
must
have
started
early
to
get
a
rest
on
the
road
and
as
we
reached
him
he
slowly
raised
himself
from
the
ground
and
made
his
salutation
to
me
and
the
sahoukar
he
appeared
tired
and
acted
his
part
well
how
is
this
ameer
singh
said
i
how
is
it
that
you
are
so
much
in
advance
of
us
oh
replied
he
readily
a
thorn
ran
into
my
foot
yesterday
and
as
i
knew
you
would
not
wait
for
me
i
started
at
midnight
with
a
few
others
who
said
they
would
be
my
companions
and
we
travelled
on
leisurely
but
i
could
not
proceed
farther
as
my
foot
was
painful
and
i
determined
to
wait
for
the
party
here
to
get
a
lift
on
a
pony
you
shall
have
it
said
i
mount
the
one
which
carries
my
baggage
and
i
will
see
that
a
barber
examines
your
foot
when
we
reach
the
end
of
the
stage
but
where
are
your
companions
they
said
there
was
a
small
river
in
advance
about
half
a
coss
off
and
they
would
proceed
thither
and
wash
their
hands
and
faces
they
bade
me
tell
you
that
if
i
could
not
follow
them
you
would
find
them
there
good
said
i
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
there
is
water
near
we
can
dismount
and
refresh
ourselves
for
the
stage
is
a
long
one
how
say
you
séth
sahib
you
hindoos
are
as
particular
about
your
morning
ablutions
as
we
moslems
are
true
true
he
replied
the
news
is
welcome
for
my
mouth
is
dry
and
i
have
not
as
yet
washed
it
we
will
stop
for
a
short
time
besides
my
stomach
is
empty
and
i
have
sweetmeats
with
me
which
i
will
share
with
you
meer
sahib
it
is
ill
travelling
without
something
in
the
inside
a
good
thought
i
replied
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
them
i
usually
bring
some
myself
but
have
neglected
to
do
so
in
this
instance
the
scout
was
right
the
rivulet
he
mentioned
was
scarcely
as
far
as
he
had
said
and
we
reached
it
after
a
few
minutes
riding
and
sure
enough
there
were
my
men
sitting
unconcernedly
by
the
edge
of
the
water
busily
discussing
a
hasty
meal
of
some
cakes
they
had
brought
with
them
bhillmanjeh
have
you
cleaned
the
hole
i
eagerly
inquired
of
the
belha
manjeh
he
replied
what
did
you
ask
said
the
sahoukar
if
they
have
not
a
clean
vessel
for
you
to
drink
out
of
you
can
have
one
of
mine
thanks
for
your
kindness
i
replied
but
my
good
fellow
here
tells
me
that
he
has
brought
one
and
cleaned
it
ready
for
me
we
all
dismounted
the
men
rushed
into
the
water
and
were
each
and
all
busily
engaged
in
washing
their
mouths
and
teeth
and
drinking
of
the
pure
element
which
murmured
over
its
pebbly
bed
beneath
their
feet
but
none
of
them
quitted
their
stations
and
only
awaited
the
signal
to
do
their
work
is
the
bhil
far
distant
i
asked
of
the
belha
who
presented
me
with
a
lota
of
water
for
the
purposes
of
ablution
about
an
arrow
flight
said
he
down
yonder
in
that
thicket
it
is
a
good
place
and
a
one
it
was
on
this
spot
that
ganesha
jemadar
had
a
rare
bunij
last
year
but
do
not
delay
for
the
sun
is
high
and
travellers
may
be
coming
from
the
stage
before
us
this
is
the
only
running
water
on
the
road
and
all
hasten
to
it
to
refresh
themselves
then
i
am
ready
said
i
and
when
you
see
me
close
to
the
sahoukar
i
will
give
the
signal
i
see
the
men
are
all
prepared
and
i
walked
towards
him
why
do
you
give
the
jhirnee
said
to
me
as
i
passed
him
we
are
all
waiting
for
it
now
said
i
be
ready
i
go
to
my
station
the
fellow
near
whom
he
was
standing
turned
round
hearing
us
converse
in
a
strange
language
but
he
immediately
afterwards
sat
down
and
resumed
the
operation
of
cleaning
his
teeth
with
great
assiduity
there
were
two
men
behind
him
who
would
shortly
save
him
the
trouble
why
séthjee
said
i
i
wonder
you
do
not
go
up
higher
here
you
have
the
water
muddied
by
all
the
fellows
above
you
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
a
deep
place
where
i
have
just
washed
and
where
the
water
is
clear
ah
i
did
not
think
of
it
said
he
i
will
follow
you
he
had
been
washing
low
down
and
as
i
got
him
into
the
middle
of
the
party
i
gave
the
jhirnee
sahib
though
i
had
not
killed
a
man
with
the
roomal
for
nearly
four
years
i
had
not
forgotten
my
old
trick
he
was
dead
i
think
ere
he
reached
my
feet
stupid
it
was
in
us
to
delay
and
i
prevented
the
like
in
future
every
man
resumed
his
employment
of
washing
himself
as
though
nothing
had
happened
and
there
lay
the
bodies
on
the
sand
we
were
once
again
fated
to
be
interrupted
two
travellers
were
seen
approaching
and
the
bodies
were
hastily
covered
with
sheets
as
if
those
who
lay
beneath
them
were
asleep
and
i
cried
to
the
men
for
some
of
them
to
sit
and
others
lie
down
and
all
to
feign
great
weariness
they
did
so
and
the
men
came
up
they
were
poor
creatures
hardly
worth
killing
and
i
proposed
to
peer
khan
to
let
them
go
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
let
them
go
he
cried
are
you
mad
do
you
not
think
that
these
fellows
already
suspect
who
we
are
does
a
man
ever
come
into
the
presence
of
the
dead
be
they
ever
so
well
covered
or
disguised
without
a
feeling
that
they
are
dead
and
see
some
of
our
men
are
speaking
to
them
they
are
true
bunij
and
davee
has
sent
them
as
you
will
said
i
but
there
may
be
more
of
them
hardly
so
soon
replied
he
these
fellows
must
have
left
in
the
night
to
be
here
so
early
but
come
let
us
ask
them
and
we
walked
up
to
them
salam
said
i
where
are
you
from
so
early
you
have
travelled
fast
if
you
have
come
from
the
stage
we
hope
to
reach
in
the
course
of
the
day
how
far
is
it
it
is
seven
long
coss
said
the
man
and
the
sun
will
be
high
and
hot
before
you
reach
it
but
we
are
in
haste
and
must
proceed
stay
said
i
dare
not
move
till
you
are
allowed
and
tell
me
how
many
travellers
put
up
last
night
in
the
village
from
whence
you
have
come
two
besides
ourselves
replied
the
other
of
the
two
evidently
in
alarm
at
my
question
why
do
you
ask
are
you
sure
there
were
no
more
certain
he
replied
we
travelled
together
from
jubbulpoor
and
put
up
in
the
same
house
and
how
far
are
they
behind
you
they
will
be
here
immediately
i
should
think
for
we
started
at
the
same
time
but
have
outstripped
them
good
said
i
now
sit
down
there
and
wait
till
they
come
why
is
this
cried
both
by
what
right
do
you
detain
travellers
we
will
go
on
dare
to
stir
at
your
peril
said
i
you
have
intruded
on
us
and
must
pay
the
penalty
what
penalty
are
you
thieves
if
so
take
what
you
will
from
us
and
let
us
go
we
are
not
thieves
said
peer
khan
but
stay
quiet
we
are
worse
worse
then
brother
we
are
lost
cried
one
to
the
other
these
villains
are
thugs
it
is
even
as
i
whispered
to
you
when
you
must
needs
stop
among
them
they
have
been
at
their
horrid
work
and
yonder
lie
those
whom
they
have
destroyed
yes
said
i
unhappy
men
you
have
guessed
right
yonder
lie
the
dead
and
you
will
soon
be
numbered
with
them
it
is
useless
to
strive
against
your
destiny
i
turned
away
for
i
felt
sahib
i
felt
sick
at
the
thoughts
of
destroying
these
inoffensive
people
they
might
have
passed
on
but
peer
khan
was
right
they
had
detected
the
dead
though
the
bodies
had
been
laid
out
and
covered
as
if
the
senseless
forms
were
sleeping
but
they
lay
like
lumps
of
clay
no
measured
breathing
disturbed
the
folds
of
the
sheets
which
covered
them
and
a
glance
had
been
sufficient
to
tell
the
tale
to
the
unfortunate
people
who
had
seen
them
but
i
shook
off
the
feeling
as
best
i
could
had
i
given
way
to
it
or
betrayed
its
existence
to
my
associates
the
power
i
possessed
over
them
would
have
been
lost
and
it
was
the
spirit
of
my
existence
they
must
die
said
i
to
peer
khan
you
were
right
and
they
had
guessed
the
truth
but
i
wish
it
had
been
otherwise
and
the
lazy
lughaees
had
done
their
work
quickly
they
might
have
passed
on
and
we
have
had
a
good
morning
work
without
them
they
are
not
worth
having
i
would
not
exchange
places
with
them
for
anything
you
could
name
meer
sahib
and
perhaps
it
were
well
to
put
them
out
of
their
suspense
do
so
peer
khan
and
get
the
rest
with
them
removed
i
will
deal
with
one
of
the
other
two
coming
up
these
fellows
are
half
dead
already
with
fear
and
the
others
i
will
fall
on
in
my
own
way
i
hate
such
passive
victims
as
these
will
be
peer
khan
and
another
went
to
the
miserable
wretches
who
remained
sitting
on
the
ground
where
we
had
left
them
i
watched
them
they
stood
up
mechanically
when
they
were
ordered
to
do
so
and
stretched
out
their
necks
for
the
fatal
roomal
and
were
slain
as
unresistingly
as
sheep
beneath
the
knife
of
the
butcher
the
rest
of
the
travellers
were
not
long
coming
and
were
only
two
as
the
others
had
said
now
said
i
to
motee
these
fellows
must
be
dealt
with
at
once
you
take
one
i
will
the
other
they
must
not
utter
a
word
i
am
ready
said
he
and
we
arose
and
lounged
about
the
road
the
travellers
came
up
one
was
a
young
and
the
other
an
old
man
i
marked
the
young
one
and
as
he
passed
me
a
thug
laid
hold
of
his
arm
he
turned
round
to
resent
it
and
i
was
ready
these
too
were
carried
away
and
after
collecting
our
dispersed
party
we
once
more
pursued
our
route
without
interruption
it
had
been
a
good
morning
work
the
sahoukar
was
as
rich
as
the
bhutteara
had
said
and
four
thousand
three
hundred
rupees
greeted
our
expectant
eyes
as
the
contents
of
the
laden
ponies
were
examined
besides
these
there
were
six
handsome
shawls
worth
better
than
a
thousand
more
and
a
few
pieces
of
cotton
cloth
which
were
torn
up
and
immediately
distributed
the
other
four
travellers
had
upwards
of
a
hundred
rupees
a
sum
not
to
be
despised
and
which
i
divided
equally
among
the
band
reserving
the
large
booty
and
adding
it
to
the
sum
we
had
already
gained
chapter
xxix
we
reached
jubbulpoor
without
another
adventure
of
any
kind
and
rested
there
for
two
days
peer
khan
motee
and
myself
perambulated
the
bazars
during
the
whole
time
but
not
a
traveller
could
we
meet
with
nor
could
we
learn
that
any
were
expected
it
was
therefore
of
no
use
to
remain
and
as
we
had
still
plenty
of
time
before
us
we
could
travel
as
leisurely
as
we
pleased
so
on
the
third
morning
we
again
proceeded
the
country
between
jubbulpoor
and
nagpoor
is
a
wild
waste
villages
are
not
met
with
for
miles
and
miles
the
road
is
stony
and
uneven
and
the
jungle
thick
and
dangerous
for
nearly
the
whole
way
on
this
account
the
tract
has
always
been
a
favourite
resort
of
thugs
and
more
affairs
have
come
off
in
those
few
marches
than
perhaps
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
frequented
by
us
we
were
all
regretting
that
we
had
not
met
with
some
bunij
at
jubbulpoor
wherewith
to
beguile
the
weariness
of
the
road
when
at
our
second
stage
soon
after
we
had
arrived
motee
who
had
gone
to
look
out
for
work
for
us
returned
with
the
glad
news
that
there
was
a
palankeen
at
the
door
of
a
shop
surrounded
by
bearers
and
a
few
soldiers
which
looked
very
much
as
if
it
belonged
to
a
traveller
but
he
must
be
of
rank
said
motee
therefore
i
humbly
suggest
that
you
meer
sahib
should
undertake
to
see
who
he
is
and
to
secure
him
if
possible
i
followed
his
advice
and
changing
my
travelling
attire
for
a
dress
which
would
ensure
my
civil
reception
i
armed
myself
and
attended
by
a
thug
who
carried
my
hooka
i
sauntered
into
the
village
i
soon
saw
the
palankeen
and
men
about
it
and
in
order
to
gain
some
intelligence
to
guide
me
i
went
to
a
tumbolee
shop
directly
opposite
to
it
and
sitting
down
entered
into
conversation
with
the
vendor
of
tobacco
and
pan
this
a
wild
country
you
live
in
my
friend
said
i
yes
it
is
indeed
as
you
say
he
replied
and
were
it
not
for
you
travellers
a
poor
man
would
have
little
chance
of
filling
his
belly
by
selling
pan
and
tobacco
but
as
it
is
my
trade
thrives
well
there
do
not
seem
to
be
many
on
the
road
said
i
i
have
come
from
jubbulpoor
without
meeting
a
soul
why
the
roads
are
hardly
much
frequented
yet
he
rejoined
but
in
a
month
more
there
will
be
hundreds
and
there
he
continued
pointing
to
the
house
over
the
way
there
is
almost
the
only
one
i
have
seen
for
some
time
who
is
it
i
asked
and
where
has
he
come
from
he
was
not
with
us
i
know
not
replied
the
tumbolee
nor
do
i
care
whoever
he
is
he
has
bought
a
quantity
of
my
stuff
and
it
was
the
first
silver
which
crossed
my
hands
this
morning
i
saw
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
this
man
so
i
went
to
a
bunnea
a
little
further
off
and
after
a
few
preparatory
and
indifferent
questions
asked
him
whether
he
knew
aught
of
the
traveller
but
he
knew
nothing
either
except
that
a
had
bought
some
flour
of
him
they
say
said
he
that
it
is
a
gentleman
of
rank
who
is
travelling
privately
and
does
not
wish
to
be
known
at
any
rate
sahib
i
know
nothing
about
him
i
suppose
however
he
will
come
out
in
a
short
time
this
is
very
strange
thought
i
here
is
a
gay
palankeen
eight
bearers
and
some
soldiers
with
it
come
into
this
wretched
place
and
yet
no
one
curiosity
is
aroused
who
can
it
be
i
will
return
to
the
tumbolee
and
sit
awhile
i
may
see
though
i
can
not
hear
anything
of
this
mysterious
person
i
sat
down
at
the
shop
and
calling
to
my
attendant
for
my
hooka
remained
there
smoking
in
the
hope
that
some
one
might
appear
from
behind
the
cloths
which
were
stretched
across
the
verandah
nor
did
i
stay
long
in
vain
i
saw
them
gently
move
once
or
twice
and
thought
i
could
perceive
the
sparkle
of
a
brilliant
eye
directed
to
me
i
riveted
my
gaze
on
the
envious
purdah
and
after
along
interval
it
was
quickly
opened
and
afforded
me
a
transient
momentary
view
of
a
face
radiant
with
beauty
but
it
was
as
instantly
closed
again
and
i
was
left
in
vain
conjecture
as
to
the
beautiful
but
mysterious
person
who
had
thus
partially
discovered
herself
to
me
it
would
not
have
suited
my
purpose
to
have
personally
interrogated
any
of
the
bearers
who
were
lying
and
sitting
about
the
palankeen
as
it
would
have
rendered
them
suspicious
and
would
have
been
impertinent
after
all
it
was
only
a
woman
what
had
i
to
do
with
women
now
and
had
i
not
made
an
inward
resolution
never
to
seek
them
as
bunij
nay
even
to
avoid
parties
in
which
there
might
be
any
so
i
arose
and
took
my
way
to
our
camp
firmly
resolving
that
i
would
pursue
my
march
the
next
morning
for
thought
i
she
must
be
some
lady
of
rank
travelling
to
her
lord
and
alla
forbid
that
i
should
raise
a
hand
against
one
so
defenceless
and
unprotected
and
i
thought
of
my
own
lovely
azima
and
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
her
ever
being
placed
within
reach
of
other
members
of
my
profession
who
might
not
be
so
scrupulous
as
i
was
but
sahib
the
resolves
of
men
what
are
they
passing
thoughts
which
fain
would
excite
the
mind
to
good
only
to
be
driven
away
by
the
wild
and
overpowering
influences
of
passion
despite
of
my
resolve
my
mind
was
unquiet
and
a
thousand
times
fancy
brought
to
my
view
the
look
she
had
cast
on
me
and
whispered
that
it
was
one
of
love
i
could
not
shake
it
off
and
sought
in
the
conversation
of
my
associates
wherewith
to
drive
her
from
my
thoughts
but
it
was
in
vain
that
passionate
glance
was
before
me
and
the
beauteous
eyes
which
threw
it
seemed
to
ask
for
another
a
nearer
and
more
loving
in
this
state
i
passed
the
day
now
determining
that
i
would
resist
the
temptation
which
was
gnawing
at
my
heart
and
now
almost
on
the
point
of
once
more
proceeding
to
the
village
and
seeking
out
the
unknown
object
of
my
disquietude
and
i
was
irresolute
when
towards
evening
i
saw
a
making
towards
the
camp
and
i
went
to
meet
her
but
not
with
the
intention
of
speaking
to
her
should
she
prove
to
be
only
a
village
girl
we
met
and
i
passed
her
but
i
saw
instantly
that
she
was
in
search
of
some
one
for
she
turned
round
hesitatingly
and
spoke
to
me
forgive
my
boldness
sahib
said
she
but
i
am
in
search
of
some
one
and
your
appearance
tells
me
that
it
must
be
you
speak
said
i
if
i
can
aid
you
in
anything
command
me
i
know
not
she
replied
whether
you
are
he
or
not
but
tell
me
did
you
sit
at
the
tumbolee
shop
this
morning
for
some
time
smoking
a
hooka
i
did
my
pretty
maiden
said
i
and
what
of
that
there
is
nothing
so
unusual
in
it
as
to
attract
attention
ah
no
said
the
girl
archly
but
one
saw
you
who
wishes
to
see
you
again
and
if
you
will
now
follow
me
i
will
guide
you
and
who
may
this
person
be
i
asked
and
what
can
be
his
or
her
business
with
a
traveller
your
first
question
i
may
not
answer
said
the
girl
and
as
to
the
second
i
am
ignorant
but
by
your
soul
follow
me
for
the
matter
is
urgent
and
i
have
most
express
commands
to
bring
you
if
i
possibly
can
i
follow
you
said
i
lead
on
then
keep
behind
me
at
some
distance
she
said
and
when
you
see
me
enter
the
house
step
boldly
in
after
me
as
if
you
were
the
master
i
followed
her
but
ah
sahib
observe
the
power
of
destiny
i
might
have
sat
in
my
tent
and
denied
myself
to
the
girl
who
something
told
me
had
come
to
seek
me
when
i
first
saw
her
approach
i
might
when
i
did
advance
to
meet
her
have
passed
on
indifferently
and
even
when
she
spoke
to
me
i
might
have
denied
that
i
was
the
person
she
was
sent
after
or
i
might
have
refused
to
accompany
her
but
destiny
impelled
me
on
nay
it
led
me
by
the
nose
after
a
to
plunge
into
an
adventure
i
fain
would
have
avoided
and
which
my
heart
told
me
must
end
miserably
sahib
there
is
no
opposing
fate
by
the
meanest
ends
it
works
out
the
greatest
deeds
and
we
are
its
slaves
body
and
soul
blindly
to
do
as
its
will
works
i
say
not
thugs
only
but
the
whole
human
race
is
it
not
so
it
appears
to
me
ameer
ali
said
i
that
poor
destiny
has
the
blame
whenever
your
own
wicked
hearts
fixed
themselves
on
any
object
and
you
followed
their
suggestions
nay
but
i
would
have
avoided
this
cried
the
thug
and
have
i
not
told
you
so
alla
knows
i
would
not
have
entered
into
this
matter
but
what
could
i
do
what
were
my
weak
resolves
compared
with
his
will
and
yet
you
will
not
believe
me
sahib
i
do
not
tell
a
lie
i
dare
say
not
said
i
but
the
beautiful
eyes
were
too
much
for
you
so
go
on
with
your
story
the
thug
laughed
they
were
indeed
said
he
and
accursed
be
the
hour
in
which
i
saw
them
but
i
will
proceed
the
slave
preceded
me
at
some
distance
i
followed
her
through
the
village
and
its
bazars
and
saw
her
enter
the
house
before
which
i
had
sat
in
the
morning
i
too
entered
it
leaving
my
slippers
at
the
door
and
with
the
confident
air
of
a
man
who
goes
into
his
own
house
i
had
just
passed
the
threshold
when
the
slave
stopped
me
wait
a
moment
said
she
i
go
to
announce
you
and
she
pulled
aside
the
temporary
screen
and
went
in
in
a
few
moments
she
returned
and
bade
me
follow
her
i
obeyed
her
and
in
the
next
instant
was
in
the
presence
of
the
unknown
who
was
hidden
from
my
sight
by
an
envious
sheet
which
covered
the
whole
of
her
person
and
her
face
was
turned
away
from
me
towards
the
wall
lady
said
i
your
slave
is
come
and
aught
that
he
can
do
for
one
so
lovely
he
will
perform
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
speak
your
commands
are
on
my
head
and
eyes
byto
she
said
in
a
low
timid
voice
i
have
somewhat
to
ask
thee
i
obeyed
and
seated
myself
at
a
respectful
distance
from
her
on
the
carpet
you
will
think
me
bold
and
shameless
i
fear
stranger
said
she
for
thus
admitting
you
to
my
presence
nay
even
to
my
chamber
but
alas
i
am
a
widow
and
need
the
protection
you
are
able
perhaps
to
afford
me
which
way
do
you
travel
towards
nagpoor
i
replied
i
purpose
leaving
this
miserable
place
early
and
i
have
come
from
jubbulpoor
from
whence
i
have
also
come
she
said
and
i
am
going
too
to
nagpoor
ah
my
destiny
is
good
which
has
sent
me
one
who
will
protect
the
lonely
and
friendless
widow
it
is
strange
lady
said
i
that
we
did
not
meet
before
having
come
the
same
road
no
she
replied
it
is
not
since
i
was
behind
you
i
heard
you
were
before
me
and
i
travelled
fast
to
overtake
you
we
have
now
met
and
as
i
must
proceed
the
remainder
of
my
journey
alone
i
implore
you
to
allow
me
for
the
stage
to
join
your
party
with
which
as
i
hear
it
is
a
large
one
i
shall
be
safe
and
free
from
anxiety
your
wish
is
granted
lady
i
said
and
any
protection
against
the
dangers
of
the
way
which
your
poor
slave
can
afford
shall
be
cheerfully
given
i
will
send
a
man
early
to
awaken
you
and
promise
that
i
will
not
leave
the
village
without
you
she
salamed
to
me
gracefully
and
in
doing
so
the
sheet
as
if
by
accident
partly
fell
from
her
face
and
disclosed
again
to
my
enraptured
view
the
features
i
had
beheld
from
a
distance
sahib
the
shock
was
overpowering
and
every
nerve
in
my
body
tingled
only
that
a
sense
of
decency
restrained
me
i
had
risen
and
thrown
myself
at
her
feet
but
while
a
blush
as
though
of
shame
mantled
over
her
countenance
and
she
hastily
withdrew
the
glance
she
had
for
an
instant
fixed
on
me
she
replaced
the
sheet
and
again
turned
to
the
wall
bending
her
head
towards
the
ground
i
thought
it
had
been
purely
accidental
and
the
action
at
the
time
convinced
me
that
she
was
really
what
she
represented
herself
to
be
and
fearing
that
my
longer
presence
would
not
be
agreeable
or
decent
i
asked
her
if
she
had
any
further
commands
and
for
permission
to
depart
no
said
she
i
have
no
further
favour
to
beg
save
to
know
the
name
of
him
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
this
act
of
kindness
my
name
is
ameer
ali
said
i
a
poor
syud
of
hindostan
your
fluent
speech
assured
me
you
were
of
that
noble
race
i
could
not
be
mistaken
is
seldom
one
hears
it
fazil
bring
the
pan
and
utr
she
did
so
and
after
taking
the
complimentary
gift
of
dismissal
and
anointing
my
breast
and
beard
with
the
fragrant
utr
i
rose
and
made
my
obeisance
she
saluted
me
in
return
and
again
bade
me
not
forget
my
promise
i
assured
her
that
she
might
depend
upon
me
and
departed
she
must
be
what
she
says
thought
i
the
very
act
of
presenting
pan
and
utr
to
me
proves
her
rank
no
common
person
no
courtesan
would
have
thought
of
it
i
shall
only
have
to
bear
a
little
jeering
from
motee
and
peer
khan
which
i
will
resist
and
laugh
away
and
this
poor
widow
will
reach
nagpoor
in
safety
without
knowing
that
she
has
been
in
the
hands
of
murderers
but
i
said
nothing
that
night
to
any
of
them
in
reply
to
their
numerous
questions
as
to
the
fortune
i
had
met
with
in
the
village
and
whether
i
had
discovered
the
unknown
i
only
laughed
and
said
i
believed
it
was
some
for
i
knew
the
mention
of
one
would
turn
their
minds
from
the
thoughts
of
bunij
as
it
is
forbidden
to
kill
those
persons
by
the
laws
of
our
profession
and
with
my
supposition
they
appeared
satisfied
great
however
was
their
surprise
when
in
the
morning
after
having
delayed
our
departure
longer
than
usual
i
joined
the
party
of
the
lady
outside
the
village
and
they
understood
that
we
were
to
travel
in
company
i
was
overpowered
by
jokes
and
witticisms
from
peer
khan
and
motee
who
declared
i
was
a
sly
dog
thus
to
secure
the
lady
all
to
myself
and
after
protesting
vehemently
that
i
cared
not
about
her
which
only
made
them
laugh
the
more
i
became
half
angry
look
you
my
friends
said
i
this
is
a
matter
which
has
been
in
a
manner
forced
upon
me
who
the
lady
is
i
know
not
she
has
begged
of
me
to
allow
her
to
accompany
us
as
she
supposes
us
to
be
travellers
and
i
have
permitted
it
and
whether
she
be
old
or
young
ugly
or
beautiful
i
am
alike
ignorant
we
may
hereafter
find
out
her
history
but
whoever
she
be
she
has
my
promise
of
safe
escort
and
she
is
not
bunij
you
remember
my
resolution
and
you
will
see
i
can
keep
it
nay
said
motee
be
not
angry
if
a
friend
is
not
privileged
to
crack
a
joke
now
and
then
who
in
bhugwan
name
is
and
as
for
us
we
are
your
servants
and
bound
to
obey
you
by
our
oath
so
you
may
have
as
many
women
in
your
train
as
you
please
and
not
one
shall
be
bunij
so
we
pursued
our
road
several
times
i
could
not
resist
riding
up
to
the
palankeen
and
making
my
noble
horse
curvet
and
prance
beside
it
the
doors
were
at
first
closely
shut
but
one
was
gradually
opened
and
the
same
sparkling
eyes
threw
me
many
a
smiling
and
approving
look
though
the
face
was
still
hidden
alas
sahib
those
eyes
did
me
great
mischief
i
could
not
withstand
them
about
noon
when
we
had
rested
from
our
fatigue
and
my
men
were
dispersed
in
various
directions
scarcely
any
of
them
remaining
in
the
camp
the
again
came
for
me
and
i
followed
her
to
her
mistress
we
sat
a
long
time
in
silence
and
the
lady
was
muffled
up
as
i
had
before
seen
her
despite
of
all
my
conflicting
feelings
i
own
sahib
that
in
her
presence
my
home
was
forgotten
and
my
burning
desire
was
fixed
upon
the
veiled
being
before
me
of
whose
countenance
i
was
even
still
ignorant
she
spake
at
last
but
it
was
to
the
slave
go
said
she
and
wait
without
far
out
of
hearing
i
have
that
to
say
to
this
gentleman
which
must
not
enter
even
your
ears
my
fazil
she
departed
and
i
was
alone
with
the
other
and
again
there
was
a
long
and
to
me
a
painful
silence
meer
sahib
she
said
at
length
what
will
you
think
of
me
what
will
you
think
of
one
who
thus
exposes
herself
to
the
gaze
of
a
man
and
a
stranger
but
it
matters
not
now
it
has
been
done
and
it
is
idle
to
think
on
the
past
i
am
the
widow
of
a
nuwab
whose
estate
is
near
agra
he
died
a
short
time
ago
at
nagpoor
on
his
way
from
hyderabad
whither
he
had
gone
to
see
his
brother
and
i
was
left
friendless
but
not
destitute
he
had
abundance
of
wealth
with
him
and
i
was
thus
enabled
to
live
at
nagpoor
after
sending
news
of
his
death
to
my
estate
in
comfort
and
affluence
the
messengers
i
sent
at
length
returned
and
brought
me
the
welcome
news
that
there
was
no
one
to
dispute
my
right
to
my
husband
property
and
that
my
own
family
which
is
as
noble
and
as
powerful
as
his
was
had
taken
possession
of
the
estate
and
held
it
on
my
account
and
they
wrote
to
me
to
return
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
among
the
respectable
men
of
the
land
choose
a
new
husband
by
whom
i
might
have
children
to
inherit
the
estate
i
immediately
set
off
on
my
return
ah
ameer
ali
how
can
i
tell
the
rest
my
tongue
from
shame
cleaves
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
my
lips
refuse
utterance
to
the
words
which
are
at
my
heart
speak
lady
said
i
by
your
soul
speak
i
burn
with
impatience
and
you
have
excited
my
curiosity
now
too
powerfully
for
it
to
rest
unsatisfied
then
i
must
speak
she
said
though
i
die
of
shame
in
the
effort
i
heard
at
the
last
village
that
you
had
arrived
i
say
you
because
my
faithful
slave
who
finds
out
everything
came
shortly
after
your
arrival
and
told
me
that
she
had
seen
the
most
beautiful
cavalier
her
thoughts
had
ever
pictured
to
her
she
recounted
your
noble
air
the
beauty
of
your
person
the
grace
with
which
you
managed
your
fiery
steed
and
above
all
the
sweet
and
amiable
expression
of
your
countenance
the
account
inflamed
me
i
had
married
an
old
man
who
was
jealous
of
my
person
and
who
never
allowed
me
to
see
any
one
but
my
poor
slave
but
i
had
heard
of
manly
beauty
and
i
longed
for
the
time
when
his
death
should
free
me
from
this
hated
thraldom
long
i
deliberated
between
the
uncontrollable
desire
which
possessed
me
and
a
sense
of
shame
and
womanly
dignity
and
perhaps
the
latter
might
have
conquered
but
you
came
and
sat
opposite
to
the
hovel
in
which
i
was
resting
my
slave
told
me
you
were
there
and
i
looked
alla
alla
once
my
eyes
had
fixed
themselves
on
you
i
could
not
withdraw
them
and
as
the
hole
through
which
i
gazed
did
not
afford
me
a
full
view
of
your
person
i
partially
opened
the
curtain
and
feasted
my
soul
with
your
appearance
you
went
away
and
i
fell
back
on
my
carpet
in
despair
my
slave
at
last
restored
me
to
consciousness
but
i
raved
about
you
and
fearful
that
my
senses
would
leave
me
she
went
and
brought
you
when
you
entered
how
i
longed
to
throw
myself
at
your
feet
but
shame
prevailed
and
after
a
commonplace
conversation
though
my
soul
was
on
fire
and
my
liver
had
turned
into
water
i
suffered
you
to
depart
i
told
my
people
that
i
must
return
to
nagpoor
as
i
had
forgotten
to
redeem
some
jewels
i
had
left
in
pledge
which
were
valuable
and
they
believed
me
ameer
ali
cried
she
suddenly
throwing
off
her
veil
and
casting
herself
at
my
feet
while
she
buried
her
head
in
my
lap
ameer
ali
this
is
my
tale
of
shame
i
love
you
alla
only
knows
how
my
soul
burns
for
you
i
will
be
your
slave
for
ever
whither
you
go
thither
will
i
follow
whoever
you
are
and
whatever
you
are
i
am
yours
and
yours
only
but
i
shall
die
without
you
alas
why
did
you
come
to
me
chapter
xxx
and
where
now
were
all
my
resolutions
by
alla
sahib
i
had
forgotten
all
home
wife
children
i
thought
not
of
them
but
i
drank
deeply
of
love
wild
passionate
burning
love
from
her
eyes
and
i
caressed
her
as
though
she
were
mine
own
there
we
sat
and
though
guilt
was
in
my
soul
and
it
accused
me
of
infidelity
to
my
oft
repeated
vows
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
her
and
i
suffered
her
caresses
in
return
though
they
often
struck
to
my
heart
like
the
blows
of
a
sharp
knife
hours
passed
thus
i
thought
not
of
them
she
seated
at
my
feet
and
i
with
my
hands
entwined
in
her
long
silken
hair
and
gazing
at
her
face
of
such
loveliness
that
never
had
my
wildest
dreams
pictured
anything
like
it
zora
was
beautiful
azima
was
even
more
so
but
shurfun
surpassed
them
both
in
as
great
a
degree
as
they
excelled
any
of
their
sex
i
had
ever
seen
fain
would
she
have
had
me
stay
with
her
fain
would
she
the
temptress
have
then
and
there
separated
me
from
my
band
and
led
me
with
herself
whither
she
cared
not
so
i
was
with
her
and
she
with
me
wealth
she
said
she
had
in
abundance
and
we
could
fly
to
some
undiscoverable
spot
where
we
should
pass
years
of
bliss
together
and
where
she
would
by
communication
with
her
family
procure
such
money
from
time
to
time
as
would
enable
us
to
live
in
affluence
ameer
ali
said
she
you
are
young
you
are
unknown
you
have
to
fight
your
way
to
fame
upon
a
bare
pittance
and
for
this
will
you
risk
your
precious
life
when
i
offer
you
everything
i
possess
and
swear
that
i
am
your
slave
ah
you
will
not
you
can
not
now
leave
me
to
perish
in
despair
and
die
of
unrequited
love
speak
my
soul
you
will
not
leave
me
wretch
and
perjured
that
i
was
i
swore
to
obey
her
wishes
sahib
it
was
a
sore
temptation
and
it
overcame
me
at
last
i
tore
myself
away
from
her
but
not
till
i
had
sworn
by
her
head
and
eyes
to
return
the
following
day
when
being
more
calm
we
might
arrange
our
plans
for
the
future
i
returned
to
my
little
tent
and
there
in
the
agony
of
my
soul
i
rolled
on
the
ground
i
raved
i
refused
to
eat
and
was
as
one
bereft
of
sense
i
spoke
rudely
to
peer
khan
who
having
been
called
by
my
attendant
came
to
comfort
me
and
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
driving
my
dagger
to
my
heart
to
end
a
life
which
though
a
splendid
prospect
was
open
to
it
could
never
afterwards
be
aught
but
one
of
guilty
misery
but
the
passion
reached
its
height
and
as
a
which
after
a
burst
of
internal
commotion
after
its
deep
peal
has
gone
forth
and
it
has
ejected
the
lightning
from
its
bosom
gradually
pours
its
flood
of
waters
to
soothe
and
refresh
the
earth
so
did
mine
eyes
now
rain
tears
and
they
calmed
me
i
can
now
ask
and
take
advice
thought
i
and
peer
khan
who
is
fondly
attached
to
me
will
give
it
as
he
would
to
a
brother
i
sent
for
him
and
after
apologizing
for
my
rudeness
said
he
would
find
the
cause
of
it
in
the
relation
i
would
give
of
the
last
few
hours
i
told
him
all
and
awaited
his
answer
my
heart
was
relieved
of
a
load
of
oppressive
thought
and
i
was
the
better
for
it
he
pondered
long
ere
he
spoke
at
last
he
said
meer
sahib
this
is
a
difficult
business
indeed
and
i
hardly
know
what
to
advise
go
to
her
be
a
man
and
give
not
way
to
this
boyish
passion
which
ill
suits
you
try
to
persuade
her
that
you
can
not
do
as
she
wishes
speak
to
her
kindly
yet
firmly
of
her
home
of
her
relatives
and
of
the
guilt
which
must
cleave
to
you
both
from
the
connection
she
proposes
tell
her
you
have
a
wife
and
two
children
and
if
she
is
a
true
woman
she
will
be
fired
with
jealousy
and
will
quarrel
with
you
do
you
then
become
irritated
in
your
turn
and
leave
her
to
go
her
own
way
and
find
some
one
who
may
not
be
so
scrupulous
and
may
take
advantage
of
her
blind
passions
and
if
all
this
fail
if
no
words
of
yours
can
drive
these
foolish
ideas
from
her
brain
we
have
only
to
make
a
long
march
in
some
unknown
direction
and
at
once
be
quit
of
her
i
know
the
paths
through
the
jungles
and
by
them
difficult
as
they
are
we
can
easily
reach
berar
where
she
will
never
again
hear
of
us
i
thanked
him
cordially
for
his
advice
and
that
part
of
it
which
related
to
azima
and
my
children
struck
forcibly
on
my
heart
i
was
as
yet
thanks
to
the
protection
of
the
prophet
pure
and
by
his
aid
i
would
remain
so
i
determined
i
would
urge
my
previous
ties
to
her
so
forcibly
and
i
would
depict
my
love
for
my
wife
in
such
colours
that
she
should
at
once
reject
me
full
of
these
resolutions
i
once
more
obeyed
her
summons
sent
me
by
her
slave
and
followed
the
girl
and
as
we
had
made
a
long
march
of
twelve
coss
it
was
now
late
in
the
day
i
need
not
again
tell
you
sahib
of
all
her
love
for
me
which
she
now
poured
forth
without
check
or
reserve
she
had
fairly
cast
away
all
shame
and
would
hear
of
nothing
i
could
represent
as
to
the
consequence
of
our
connection
with
her
family
i
had
only
now
one
resource
and
as
a
man
in
alarm
for
his
life
fires
the
train
of
a
mine
so
did
i
hurriedly
and
perhaps
incoherently
mention
my
wife
and
children
the
effect
was
as
peer
khan
had
expected
instantaneous
she
had
been
sitting
at
my
feet
listening
to
my
objections
and
playfully
reasoning
with
me
against
them
but
at
these
words
she
suddenly
started
to
her
feet
and
drew
her
noble
figure
up
to
its
full
height
while
her
eyes
flashed
as
she
smoothed
back
her
flowing
hair
from
her
brow
the
veins
of
her
forehead
and
neck
swelled
and
she
was
terrible
to
look
on
i
confess
i
quailed
beneath
the
glances
of
scorn
she
cast
on
me
man
she
cried
at
length
ah
vile
and
faithless
wretch
say
did
i
hear
thee
aright
dare
to
say
again
that
thou
hast
a
wife
and
children
what
dirt
hast
thou
eaten
it
was
my
time
and
my
good
resolutions
came
to
my
aid
i
rose
and
confronted
her
with
a
look
as
proud
and
unflinching
as
her
own
yes
shurfun
i
said
i
have
spoken
the
truth
one
as
beautiful
as
thou
art
believes
me
faithful
and
faithful
i
will
remain
to
her
long
i
reasoned
with
thee
and
hadst
thou
not
been
carried
away
and
thy
good
feelings
deadened
by
an
idle
and
sudden
passion
thou
hadst
heard
my
words
and
submitted
to
them
for
the
sake
of
thy
family
and
hitherto
untarnished
honour
for
my
unfortunate
share
in
this
matter
may
alla
forgive
me
lady
it
was
thy
maddening
beauty
which
caused
me
to
err
but
he
has
strengthened
my
heart
and
again
i
implore
thee
to
hear
the
words
of
friendship
and
be
thyself
again
how
can
i
tell
you
sahib
of
her
despair
and
the
bitterness
of
her
expressions
as
she
upbraided
me
with
my
deceit
i
deserved
them
all
and
not
a
word
did
i
answer
in
return
i
could
not
and
i
dared
not
approach
her
lest
my
heart
should
again
yield
to
her
blandishments
for
i
felt
that
a
kind
word
or
action
would
renew
them
and
cause
her
to
forget
the
past
and
it
was
pitiable
to
see
her
as
she
now
sat
on
the
ground
moaning
and
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
while
at
intervals
she
tore
her
hair
and
beat
her
breasts
in
her
agony
of
spirit
leave
me
she
said
at
last
ah
ameer
ali
thou
hast
broken
a
heart
which
could
have
loved
thee
for
ever
i
do
not
complain
it
is
the
will
of
alla
that
the
only
man
i
could
ever
have
loved
and
honoured
should
deceive
me
and
i
submit
shurfun
is
not
yet
reduced
so
low
that
she
could
put
up
with
the
second
place
in
any
man
heart
were
he
the
monarch
of
delhi
itself
go
the
sight
of
you
is
painful
to
my
soul
and
may
alla
forgive
us
both
i
left
her
i
hastened
to
peer
khan
and
related
the
whole
to
him
and
he
was
delighted
now
said
he
to
make
the
matter
sure
let
us
retrace
our
steps
it
is
not
attended
with
any
risk
for
we
can
put
up
anywhere
and
we
need
not
visit
the
village
we
before
halted
at
we
have
no
hope
of
booty
at
nagpoor
and
if
you
like
we
can
penetrate
as
i
said
before
into
berar
and
return
by
khândésh
which
was
our
original
idea
i
agree
said
i
this
woman
must
be
avoided
at
every
risk
to
save
appearances
she
must
go
on
to
nagpoor
with
her
people
and
we
shall
by
following
your
advice
avoid
her
altogether
accordingly
the
next
morning
instead
of
pursuing
the
road
we
had
taken
we
turned
back
and
after
a
few
hours
travel
halted
at
a
small
village
a
few
coss
distant
from
the
one
we
had
left
but
little
had
i
calculated
on
that
woman
love
and
wild
passions
before
the
day
was
half
spent
we
saw
her
palankeen
attended
by
her
men
advancing
towards
the
village
by
the
way
we
had
come
what
was
to
be
done
i
was
for
instant
flight
into
the
wild
jungles
by
which
we
were
surrounded
and
where
she
would
soon
have
lost
all
traces
of
us
but
peer
khan
and
motee
would
not
hear
of
it
it
would
be
cowardly
said
they
there
is
no
occasion
thus
to
run
before
a
woman
and
why
should
we
expose
ourselves
to
dangers
from
wild
beasts
and
the
unhealthiness
of
the
forest
on
her
account
and
added
motee
if
she
follow
us
now
depend
upon
it
it
is
not
on
your
account
but
because
she
is
now
determined
to
go
to
her
home
as
quickly
as
possible
it
may
be
so
said
i
whatever
her
plans
may
be
they
will
not
influence
my
determinations
yet
my
mind
misgave
me
that
she
would
again
follow
us
and
a
short
time
proved
that
my
suspicions
were
right
the
slave
came
by
stealth
to
my
tent
disguised
as
a
seller
of
milk
and
i
followed
her
for
i
knew
not
why
her
mistress
had
sent
for
me
and
why
she
now
sought
me
after
our
last
meeting
i
reached
her
presence
and
again
we
were
alone
i
armed
myself
against
her
blandishments
and
determined
to
oppose
them
with
scorn
that
she
might
again
quarrel
with
me
and
leave
me
for
ever
i
can
not
relate
to
you
sahib
all
that
passed
between
us
at
one
time
she
was
all
love
seeking
to
throw
herself
into
my
arms
and
beseeching
me
to
have
pity
on
her
for
she
felt
that
her
reputation
was
gone
in
words
that
would
have
moved
a
heart
of
stone
at
another
violently
upbraiding
me
for
my
perfidy
and
bidding
me
begone
from
her
sight
yet
each
time
as
i
turned
to
depart
she
would
prevent
me
and
again
implore
me
to
listen
and
agree
to
her
proposals
at
last
i
could
bear
with
her
no
longer
i
was
provoked
with
her
importunities
and
vexed
at
my
own
irresolute
conduct
i
bade
her
farewell
and
was
quitting
the
shed
where
she
had
put
up
for
the
day
when
she
screamed
to
me
to
come
back
i
returned
shurfun
said
i
this
is
foolishness
and
the
conduct
of
children
why
should
we
thus
torment
each
other
you
have
heard
my
determination
and
could
you
offer
me
the
throne
of
delhi
i
might
share
it
with
you
but
my
heart
would
be
hers
who
now
possesses
it
and
you
would
live
a
torment
to
yourself
and
me
jealousy
even
now
possesses
your
heart
and
what
would
not
that
passion
become
when
you
were
in
intercourse
with
the
object
you
even
now
hate
and
whom
you
could
not
separate
from
me
i
care
not
for
your
words
said
she
i
care
not
for
the
consequences
i
have
set
my
life
and
my
fame
on
the
issue
of
this
and
refuse
me
at
your
peril
as
for
your
wife
i
hate
her
not
does
not
our
law
allow
you
four
wives
is
it
not
so
written
in
the
blessed
koran
you
can
not
deny
it
even
i
who
am
a
woman
know
it
i
would
love
azima
as
a
sister
and
your
children
for
your
sake
and
can
you
refuse
wealth
and
a
future
life
of
distinction
for
them
oh
man
are
you
bereft
of
sense
see
i
speak
to
you
calmly
and
reason
with
you
as
i
would
were
i
your
sister
i
would
to
alla
thou
wert
my
sister
i
said
i
could
love
thee
fondly
as
a
sister
but
never
never
can
i
consent
to
this
unhallowed
and
disgraceful
union
yes
shurfun
disgraceful
disguise
it
with
all
thy
flattering
and
sweet
words
yet
it
is
disgraceful
do
you
dream
for
a
moment
that
your
proud
family
would
receive
as
your
husband
as
the
sharer
of
your
property
and
wealth
a
man
unknown
to
them
one
who
has
no
family
honours
no
worldly
distinction
to
boast
of
and
with
whom
you
have
picked
up
a
casual
acquaintance
on
the
road
i
tell
you
they
would
not
go
therefore
i
beseech
you
to
your
home
and
in
after
years
i
will
send
my
azima
to
see
you
and
she
shall
pray
for
blessings
on
the
noble
woman
who
preserved
her
husband
to
her
she
sat
silent
for
some
time
but
the
fire
was
not
quenched
within
her
it
burst
forth
with
increased
violence
when
i
vainly
thought
that
my
temperate
words
had
quenched
it
for
ever
again
she
bade
me
go
but
it
was
sullenly
and
i
left
her
i
had
not
been
an
hour
in
my
tent
when
the
slave
again
came
to
but
perhaps
sahib
you
are
tired
of
my
minuteness
in
describing
all
my
interviews
with
the
moghulanee
no
said
i
ameer
ali
i
suppose
you
have
some
object
in
it
therefore
go
on
well
then
resumed
the
thug
the
slave
came
to
me
and
i
was
alone
for
the
love
of
alla
said
she
meer
sahib
do
something
for
my
poor
mistress
ever
since
you
left
her
she
has
been
in
a
kind
of
stupor
and
has
hardly
spoken
she
just
now
told
me
to
go
and
purchase
a
quantity
of
opium
for
her
and
when
i
refused
and
fell
at
her
feet
imploring
her
to
recall
her
words
she
spoke
angrily
to
me
and
said
if
i
did
not
go
she
would
go
herself
so
i
have
purchased
it
but
alas
i
know
its
fatal
use
and
you
alone
can
save
her
come
quickly
then
and
speak
a
kind
word
to
her
i
have
heard
all
that
has
passed
and
you
have
behaved
like
a
man
of
honour
but
since
you
can
not
persuade
her
to
forget
you
and
relinquish
her
intentions
at
least
for
the
time
fall
in
with
her
humour
and
agree
to
accompany
her
on
the
promise
that
she
will
not
seek
to
see
you
on
the
road
and
say
that
when
you
reach
her
jagheer
you
will
have
your
marriage
duly
solemnized
oh
do
this
for
her
sake
you
said
you
could
love
her
as
a
sister
and
this
would
be
the
conduct
of
a
brother
well
said
i
since
the
matter
has
come
to
this
issue
that
her
life
or
death
is
in
my
hands
i
consent
and
i
arose
and
went
with
her
oh
with
what
joy
the
unhappy
girl
received
me
long
she
hung
upon
my
bosom
and
blessed
me
as
her
preserver
and
kissed
her
slave
when
she
related
what
she
had
said
to
me
and
that
i
had
agreed
to
her
wishes
it
is
to
save
your
precious
life
i
cried
that
i
thus
expose
myself
to
the
sneers
and
taunts
of
my
friends
and
your
own
think
on
the
sacrifice
i
make
in
losing
their
love
and
you
will
behave
cautiously
and
decently
on
the
road
we
need
not
meet
nay
we
must
not
the
temptation
would
be
too
strong
for
us
both
but
i
swear
by
your
head
and
eyes
i
will
not
leave
you
and
you
shall
travel
in
our
company
the
slave
had
gone
out
and
she
drew
towards
me
beware
said
she
how
you
deceive
me
for
i
know
your
secret
and
if
you
are
unfaithful
i
will
expose
it
your
life
is
in
my
hands
and
you
know
it
what
secret
cried
i
in
alarm
what
can
you
mean
i
know
that
you
are
a
thug
she
said
in
a
low
and
determined
voice
my
slave
has
discovered
you
and
a
thousand
circumstances
impress
the
belief
that
you
are
one
upon
my
mind
your
men
the
way
you
encamp
the
ceremonies
my
slave
has
seen
your
men
performing
and
the
freedom
with
which
you
go
forward
or
return
at
your
pleasure
all
these
are
conclusive
and
i
bid
you
beware
for
nothing
that
you
can
say
will
persuade
me
to
the
contrary
you
have
even
now
the
property
of
those
you
have
killed
in
your
camp
you
can
not
deny
it
your
looks
confirm
my
words
i
inwardly
cursed
the
prying
curiosity
of
the
slave
and
feared
she
had
discovered
us
through
one
of
our
men
with
whom
i
had
seen
her
conversing
and
i
determined
to
destroy
him
but
i
had
now
fairly
met
my
match
and
though
abashed
for
a
moment
i
replied
to
her
then
shurfun
since
you
have
discovered
us
i
have
no
alternative
we
must
be
united
i
to
save
my
life
and
the
lives
of
my
men
you
to
save
your
own
it
is
a
fearful
tie
which
binds
us
but
it
can
not
be
broken
i
thought
so
she
said
fool
that
i
was
not
to
have
urged
this
before
i
might
have
saved
myself
the
agony
which
i
have
endured
now
go
i
will
hear
of
you
from
day
to
day
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
conversing
unobserved
now
i
am
sure
of
you
and
my
mind
is
at
ease
i
left
her
but
my
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
she
had
discovered
us
and
by
the
rules
of
our
profession
i
could
not
conceal
it
from
my
associates
alla
alla
to
what
would
the
communication
i
must
make
to
them
lead
alas
i
dreaded
to
think
yet
it
must
be
done
a
long
time
i
deliberated
with
myself
whether
i
should
expose
the
truth
to
my
associates
and
fain
would
i
not
have
done
so
but
the
peril
we
were
in
was
so
imminent
and
the
lives
of
my
fifty
brave
fellows
were
so
completely
at
the
mercy
of
a
woman
that
i
could
not
overlook
the
strict
rules
of
my
profession
i
knew
that
it
could
only
lead
to
one
alternative
but
it
was
her
fate
and
it
could
not
be
avoided
either
by
her
or
me
as
i
expected
the
fatal
mandate
went
forth
among
us
my
men
were
astonished
and
terrified
at
the
information
shurfun
possessed
and
after
a
very
brief
consultation
her
fate
was
determined
on
sahib
you
will
think
the
worse
of
me
for
this
but
what
could
be
done
we
could
not
leave
her
she
would
have
alarmed
the
villagers
and
they
would
have
pursued
us
true
they
could
have
done
but
little
against
us
there
but
they
would
have
dogged
us
through
the
jungles
and
at
last
have
watched
their
opportunity
and
seized
us
our
next
care
was
to
endeavour
to
find
out
the
person
from
whom
she
had
gained
the
information
and
i
mentioned
the
name
of
him
with
whom
i
had
seen
the
slave
conversing
sahib
as
i
did
it
his
face
bore
the
evidence
of
conscious
guilt
he
was
a
young
man
but
little
known
to
any
of
us
and
was
one
of
the
lughaees
he
had
accompanied
peer
khan
in
his
last
expedition
and
had
behaved
well
so
well
as
to
induce
him
to
allow
his
accompanying
us
but
by
this
act
he
had
forfeited
everything
and
it
was
but
too
plain
that
he
had
been
seduced
by
the
wiles
of
that
intriguing
and
artful
slave
observing
his
altered
looks
i
at
once
accused
him
of
treachery
and
my
accusation
was
by
the
voices
of
the
band
he
must
die
cried
one
and
all
we
could
never
carry
on
our
work
with
the
knowledge
that
there
was
one
treacherous
person
with
us
and
it
is
the
rule
of
our
order
too
who
ever
spared
a
traitor
miserable
wretch
said
i
to
him
why
hast
thou
done
this
why
hast
thou
been
unfaithful
to
thine
oath
and
the
salt
thou
hast
eaten
didst
thou
not
know
the
penalty
hast
thou
not
heard
of
hundreds
of
instances
of
treachery
and
was
ever
one
pardoned
unhappy
man
thou
sayest
nothing
for
thyself
and
the
sentence
must
be
passed
upon
thee
shame
that
the
wiles
of
a
wretched
slave
should
so
far
have
led
thee
from
thy
duty
and
exposed
us
all
to
peril
jemadar
said
he
rising
i
have
sinned
and
my
hour
is
come
i
ask
not
for
mercy
for
i
know
too
well
that
it
can
not
be
shown
me
let
me
die
by
the
hands
of
my
own
people
and
i
am
content
and
if
my
fate
be
a
warning
to
them
i
am
satisfied
i
was
pure
in
my
honour
till
i
met
that
slave
she
told
me
that
you
were
to
marry
her
mistress
and
that
you
had
told
her
who
you
were
i
thought
it
true
and
i
conversed
with
her
on
the
secrets
of
our
band
i
boasted
to
her
of
the
deeds
we
had
done
and
she
consented
to
be
mine
whenever
we
could
meet
with
a
fitting
opportunity
fool
that
i
was
i
was
deceived
yet
i
offer
this
as
no
palliation
for
my
offence
let
therefore
goordut
kill
me
his
is
a
sure
hand
and
he
will
not
fail
in
his
duty
goordut
the
chief
of
our
lughaees
stepped
forward
forgive
me
your
death
said
he
to
the
fated
wretch
i
have
no
enmity
against
you
but
this
is
my
duty
and
i
must
do
it
i
forgive
you
he
replied
let
your
hand
be
firm
i
shall
offer
no
resistance
nor
struggle
let
my
be
short
goordut
looked
to
me
for
the
signal
i
gave
it
and
in
another
instant
his
victim
had
expiated
his
crime
by
death
he
suffered
passively
and
goordut
hand
never
trembled
the
body
was
taken
from
among
us
and
interred
and
henceforward
we
had
no
treachery
among
us
nor
did
i
ever
meet
with
another
instance
save
one
and
that
was
successful
you
shall
hear
of
it
hereafter
there
but
remained
to
allot
to
the
different
members
of
the
band
their
separate
places
in
the
ensuing
catastrophe
and
this
done
i
felt
that
i
had
acted
as
a
good
thug
and
that
a
misplaced
pity
had
not
influenced
me
during
the
transactions
of
the
day
strange
was
it
sahib
that
shurfun
knowing
who
we
were
should
not
when
she
had
discovered
it
at
once
have
fled
from
us
how
she
a
woman
unused
to
and
unacquainted
with
deeds
of
blood
could
have
borne
to
look
on
nay
more
to
have
caressed
and
loved
one
a
murderer
by
profession
whose
hand
was
raised
against
the
whole
human
race
is
more
than
i
have
ever
been
able
to
understand
i
can
only
say
it
was
her
fate
she
might
she
ought
to
have
avoided
me
in
every
principle
of
human
conduct
her
love
for
me
was
wicked
and
without
shame
and
a
virtuous
woman
would
have
died
before
she
had
ever
allowed
it
to
possess
her
bosom
she
might
have
cast
me
off
when
she
said
she
would
and
when
her
resolution
was
made
to
see
me
no
more
but
her
blind
passion
led
her
on
into
the
net
fate
had
spread
for
her
and
she
was
as
unable
to
avoid
it
as
you
or
i
shall
be
to
die
sahib
when
our
hour
comes
we
started
in
company
with
her
the
next
morning
i
was
determined
i
would
take
no
active
part
in
her
death
for
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
lifting
my
hand
against
one
whose
caresses
i
had
allowed
and
whose
kisses
were
i
may
say
still
warm
upon
my
lips
motee
and
peer
khan
were
allotted
to
her
and
one
of
her
attendants
was
my
share
but
hers
was
a
large
party
she
had
eight
bearers
four
sepoys
as
her
guards
and
her
slave
rode
on
a
pony
which
was
led
by
another
servant
in
all
therefore
they
were
fifteen
individuals
and
to
make
sure
of
my
best
men
were
to
fall
on
them
whenever
we
should
meet
a
fitting
place
i
knew
one
a
wild
spot
it
was
where
the
jungle
was
almost
a
forest
and
where
for
miles
on
either
side
there
was
no
human
habitation
and
i
intended
for
greater
security
to
lead
the
party
by
a
path
which
i
had
discovered
on
our
way
down
and
which
led
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
jungle
where
i
knew
our
deadly
work
would
be
sure
of
no
interruption
we
reached
the
spot
where
the
road
diverged
which
i
intended
to
take
and
after
much
opposition
on
the
part
of
her
bearers
i
succeeded
in
persuading
them
to
follow
me
by
telling
them
both
that
the
road
was
a
short
one
and
that
there
was
a
stream
of
water
which
crossed
it
whereas
on
the
main
track
there
was
none
we
gained
the
small
rivulet
and
i
dismounted
my
band
surrounded
their
unsuspecting
victims
and
eagerly
awaited
the
signal
but
i
wished
to
spare
shurfun
the
sight
of
the
dead
which
she
would
be
exposed
to
were
she
not
the
first
to
fall
i
went
to
her
palankeen
and
asked
her
to
get
out
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
i
had
brought
with
me
she
objected
at
first
as
she
would
have
to
expose
herself
to
the
rash
gaze
of
my
men
but
i
told
her
i
had
put
up
a
cloth
against
a
tree
that
it
was
but
a
few
steps
off
and
that
veiled
as
she
was
no
one
would
see
her
your
slave
is
there
already
said
i
so
come
she
is
preparing
our
meal
the
first
we
have
ever
eaten
together
she
stepped
out
cautiously
closely
muffled
in
a
sheet
so
that
she
saw
not
those
who
were
with
me
the
palankeen
too
concealed
her
person
and
as
she
arose
from
her
sitting
posture
the
roomal
of
motee
was
around
her
and
she
died
instantly
peer
khan
held
her
hands
and
the
moment
her
breath
was
gone
he
put
the
body
into
the
palankeen
and
shut
the
door
now
thus
much
is
done
said
he
we
must
finish
the
rest
and
that
quickly
they
are
all
off
their
guard
and
washing
and
drinking
in
the
stream
the
men
are
at
their
posts
bismilla
give
the
jhirnee
i
sought
my
place
and
gave
it
my
own
share
was
quickly
done
and
the
rest
too
but
one
or
two
were
unskilful
and
the
shrieks
of
the
unfortunate
but
too
guilty
slave
among
the
rest
smote
on
my
ear
and
caused
a
pang
to
shoot
to
my
heart
at
the
thought
that
they
had
all
died
for
the
wretched
caprice
of
a
wicked
woman
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
shurfun
the
sight
of
her
beautiful
features
would
have
overpowered
me
i
saw
the
lughaees
bear
her
away
but
i
followed
not
her
palankeen
was
broken
into
pieces
and
buried
with
her
wretch
that
i
am
cried
i
ah
ameer
ali
hadst
thou
no
pity
no
remorse
for
one
so
young
and
so
lovely
i
might
have
felt
it
sahib
but
the
fate
of
him
who
had
died
the
day
before
was
too
fresh
in
my
mind
to
allow
me
to
show
it
that
might
have
been
mine
had
i
done
so
besides
can
you
deny
that
it
was
her
fate
and
above
all
had
i
not
eaten
the
goor
of
the
tupounee
chapter
xxxi
after
all
had
been
completed
we
travelled
on
until
we
reached
a
small
and
wretched
village
some
coss
from
the
scene
of
our
late
adventure
where
after
the
customary
sacrifice
of
goor
the
considerable
booty
we
had
gained
was
produced
and
distributed
there
soon
arose
a
discussion
as
to
our
future
proceedings
some
advised
that
we
should
return
and
go
on
to
nagpoor
many
indeed
were
for
this
and
i
also
inclined
to
it
but
peer
khan
gave
better
counsel
saying
that
by
our
thus
going
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
same
road
we
should
certainly
be
suspected
and
perhaps
attacked
and
that
to
expose
ourselves
to
this
was
not
to
be
put
in
comparison
with
any
chance
of
booty
he
advised
that
we
should
make
the
best
of
our
way
towards
ellichpoor
avoiding
that
town
and
keeping
near
the
hills
until
we
got
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
sulabat
khan
who
if
he
heard
of
us
would
assuredly
suspect
us
of
the
death
of
the
nuwab
subzee
khan
who
had
been
his
guest
and
whose
fate
was
generally
known
over
the
country
and
attributed
with
justice
to
thugs
after
some
further
deliberation
we
all
agreed
to
his
plan
and
the
next
day
leaving
the
high
road
we
struck
into
a
and
pursued
it
and
i
was
heartily
glad
after
some
days
of
weary
travel
when
arriving
at
the
pass
near
the
deserted
temples
of
mookhtagherry
we
saw
the
wide
valley
of
berar
stretched
out
before
us
covered
with
the
still
green
and
luxuriant
crops
of
jowaree
for
some
days
previous
i
had
had
shiverings
and
pains
all
over
my
body
and
my
mind
was
restless
and
ill
at
ease
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
throw
them
off
horrible
dreams
haunted
me
at
night
and
the
figure
of
shurfun
constantly
presented
itself
to
my
fancy
now
in
the
fulness
of
her
beauty
and
now
changed
and
distorted
as
she
must
have
been
in
death
while
at
one
time
she
was
pouring
out
her
tale
of
love
to
me
and
at
another
upbraiding
me
with
her
fate
i
had
mentioned
this
to
my
companions
and
many
were
the
ceremonies
which
they
performed
over
me
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirits
which
motee
declared
had
possessed
me
but
they
were
of
no
avail
and
on
the
morning
we
reached
the
top
of
the
pass
i
was
so
ill
that
i
was
obliged
to
be
supported
on
my
horse
what
was
to
be
done
to
go
into
ellichpoor
was
to
run
into
the
mouth
and
all
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
whither
to
proceed
however
on
clearing
the
mouth
of
the
glen
through
which
the
road
ran
some
of
the
men
discerned
a
large
village
a
very
short
way
off
and
came
back
with
the
welcome
intelligence
i
was
sitting
or
rather
lying
at
a
miserable
goand
hamlet
on
the
road
and
when
i
heard
the
news
i
remembered
the
village
they
spoke
of
which
i
had
passed
the
morning
we
left
ellichpoor
with
subzee
khan
though
i
had
forgotten
its
name
thither
therefore
i
begged
they
would
carry
me
and
placing
me
upon
my
good
horse
i
was
soon
there
and
made
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
admit
of
in
the
empty
shop
of
a
bunnea
but
the
fever
raged
within
me
my
whole
frame
was
first
convulsed
with
violent
shiverings
which
were
succeeded
by
intense
burnings
i
remember
no
more
of
that
day
nor
indeed
of
many
days
after
for
i
lay
insensible
and
my
spirit
hovered
between
life
and
death
the
first
words
i
recollect
after
that
terrible
time
were
from
my
faithful
attendant
shooke
khoda
he
exclaimed
at
last
he
has
opened
his
eyes
and
he
ran
and
called
peer
khan
and
others
to
me
where
am
i
i
faintly
asked
for
in
the
violence
of
the
fever
i
had
forgotten
everything
shooke
khoda
again
exclaimed
all
he
speaks
at
last
i
again
repeated
my
question
and
it
was
answered
by
peer
khan
why
do
you
not
remember
said
he
here
you
are
in
the
good
village
of
surrusgaum
within
three
coss
of
ellichpoor
and
now
that
you
have
spoken
all
will
be
right
you
will
soon
recover
but
we
have
been
sadly
anxious
about
you
for
a
worthy
mussulman
who
is
a
hukeem
said
only
yesterday
that
you
would
die
and
bade
us
prepare
for
your
burial
however
he
was
wrong
and
inshalla
you
will
soon
see
yourself
at
the
head
of
your
brave
fellows
again
alas
khan
i
fear
not
said
i
for
i
am
weak
and
helpless
and
your
staying
with
me
only
delays
you
to
little
purpose
leave
me
to
my
fate
and
if
it
is
the
will
of
alla
that
i
should
recover
i
will
rejoin
you
at
our
home
i
feel
that
i
should
be
only
a
useless
clog
on
your
movements
for
if
i
even
get
over
this
fever
i
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
sit
on
my
horse
for
many
a
day
to
come
forsake
you
meer
sahib
never
exclaimed
all
who
were
sitting
round
me
who
will
bury
you
if
you
die
or
who
will
tend
you
if
you
recover
what
words
are
these
are
you
not
our
brother
and
more
our
leader
and
what
would
become
of
us
if
we
left
you
well
my
friends
said
i
deeply
affected
by
their
kindness
since
you
prefer
the
of
a
sick
man
to
roaming
in
the
wide
and
open
country
even
be
it
so
a
few
days
will
end
your
suspense
and
either
you
will
have
to
bury
me
here
or
if
it
be
the
pleasure
of
alla
i
shall
once
more
lead
you
to
new
enterprises
but
you
must
be
silent
said
peer
khan
for
the
hukeem
said
so
and
told
us
if
you
roused
at
all
to
send
him
word
as
he
had
prepared
some
medicine
for
you
which
he
would
administer
and
hoped
it
would
hasten
your
recovery
i
will
go
and
tell
him
the
good
news
in
a
short
time
the
khan
returned
accompanied
by
an
old
and
venerable
person
who
after
feeling
my
head
and
body
turned
to
the
khan
and
declared
that
my
state
was
satisfactory
but
said
he
as
the
fever
proceeded
from
cold
which
is
still
in
his
stomach
we
must
give
him
the
medicine
i
spoke
of
i
have
prepared
it
and
being
compounded
of
heating
drugs
it
will
soon
expel
the
cold
induce
perspiration
and
inshalla
he
will
be
a
different
being
though
he
will
be
weak
for
some
time
to
come
the
draught
was
prepared
and
though
nauseous
in
the
extreme
i
swallowed
it
and
by
his
directions
covered
myself
with
quilts
and
i
was
quickly
in
a
profuse
perspiration
and
when
the
hukeem
who
sat
by
my
side
all
the
time
thought
i
had
been
long
enough
under
this
treatment
he
withdrew
the
coverings
one
by
one
and
taking
my
wet
clothes
from
me
i
soon
fell
into
a
sound
and
refreshing
sleep
from
which
i
did
not
awake
till
the
next
morning
sun
was
shining
on
my
eyelids
i
felt
so
much
refreshed
when
i
awoke
that
i
arose
but
my
head
swam
round
and
i
fell
i
did
not
essay
to
repeat
the
exertion
but
i
was
well
i
felt
that
i
had
thrown
off
the
disease
and
i
was
thankful
soon
i
had
an
inclination
to
eat
and
after
a
slight
meal
of
kicheree
i
was
indeed
a
different
being
two
days
more
restored
me
to
convalescence
and
i
heartily
wished
to
be
again
on
the
road
toward
home
but
travelling
on
horseback
was
out
of
the
question
as
i
could
only
walk
a
few
steps
with
assistance
so
as
peer
khan
volunteered
his
services
i
despatched
him
to
ellichpoor
to
endeavour
to
hire
a
palankeen
or
dooly
with
bearers
to
carry
me
a
few
stages
or
as
long
as
i
should
find
them
necessary
he
returned
with
them
and
the
next
day
having
remunerated
the
good
hukeem
i
gladly
set
out
once
again
in
company
with
my
gallant
fellows
we
took
the
best
road
to
boorhanpoor
that
through
the
valley
of
berar
and
close
to
the
hills
and
when
we
reached
the
old
town
of
julgaum
i
felt
myself
so
strong
that
i
dismissed
the
palankeen
and
once
more
mounted
my
good
horse
a
joyful
and
inspiriting
thing
it
is
sahib
to
mount
one
horse
after
a
long
and
painful
illness
and
to
feel
once
more
the
bounds
of
the
generous
animal
under
you
as
though
he
too
rejoiced
at
his
master
recovery
he
was
like
myself
in
high
spirits
and
i
never
enjoyed
a
ride
so
much
as
i
did
on
that
morning
the
cool
breeze
fanned
my
thinned
cheek
as
i
rode
along
now
humouring
my
horse
by
allowing
him
to
bound
and
caracol
as
he
pleased
now
exercising
him
on
the
plain
and
again
rejoicing
my
band
as
they
walked
merrily
along
apparently
under
the
influence
of
the
same
joy
as
myself
and
rejoicing
to
see
me
once
more
at
their
head
we
met
with
no
adventure
till
we
reached
boorhanpoor
where
we
arrived
on
the
tenth
day
after
leaving
the
village
at
which
i
had
been
so
near
dying
indeed
we
sought
none
we
found
good
quarters
in
one
of
the
old
serais
in
the
town
and
i
was
determined
to
stay
there
until
we
met
with
something
to
lead
us
on
accordingly
men
were
daily
sent
into
the
different
bazars
but
seven
days
passed
in
idleness
and
i
began
seriously
to
think
that
the
death
of
shurfun
which
though
an
inevitable
deed
was
against
my
faithful
promises
had
caused
me
to
forfeit
the
protection
of
our
patroness
in
other
words
i
feared
my
good
fortune
had
deserted
me
and
for
once
i
proposed
a
grand
sacrifice
to
davee
and
that
the
omens
should
be
consulted
in
order
to
afford
us
some
clue
to
our
future
proceedings
it
was
done
and
the
omens
were
good
propitious
to
a
degree
said
motee
who
was
our
conductor
in
these
matters
we
shall
have
good
bunij
soon
or
these
would
never
have
been
vouchsafed
to
us
but
another
day
passed
and
still
the
sothaees
reported
nothing
the
day
after
however
about
noon
motee
came
to
me
you
may
know
said
he
that
this
place
from
its
wealth
is
frequented
by
rokurreas
or
who
bring
money
from
bombay
and
take
it
into
malwa
to
purchase
opium
i
do
said
i
what
of
that
i
heard
as
much
from
my
father
who
bade
me
return
this
way
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
some
of
them
then
said
he
i
wish
you
to
come
with
me
you
and
peer
khan
you
have
both
sharp
eyes
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
i
have
not
discovered
eight
of
them
i
have
killed
others
of
their
tribe
before
now
and
i
think
i
am
not
wrong
when
i
say
that
these
are
some
also
good
i
replied
i
will
come
and
accompanied
by
peer
khan
and
motee
we
set
forth
to
examine
the
men
whom
the
latter
had
spoken
of
in
an
empty
shop
we
found
them
wary
as
these
people
are
it
was
highly
necessary
that
we
should
not
excite
their
suspicion
so
we
hurriedly
passed
them
concealing
our
faces
in
our
handkerchiefs
yet
from
the
casual
glance
i
threw
at
them
i
was
certain
from
their
sturdy
forms
and
the
one
camel
they
had
with
them
as
well
as
from
a
kind
of
restless
and
suspicious
bearing
that
they
were
the
men
we
were
in
search
of
this
was
just
the
season
too
they
would
be
bearing
treasure
to
make
advances
to
the
poppy
cultivators
in
malwa
as
the
seed
of
the
plant
would
not
be
sown
for
another
month
at
least
i
was
satisfied
yet
how
to
ensure
their
company
i
knew
not
and
many
schemes
passed
through
my
mind
before
i
could
determine
on
anything
at
length
i
formed
one
as
i
sat
with
my
companions
on
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
river
and
whither
we
often
resorted
to
enjoy
the
fresh
breezes
and
pure
air
from
the
noble
river
which
flowed
beneath
us
i
have
been
thinking
said
i
what
we
are
to
do
to
secure
these
fellows
you
know
they
are
proverbially
wary
both
nodded
assent
well
i
continued
what
think
you
of
the
following
scheme
you
and
i
peer
khan
will
pretend
to
be
travellers
we
will
go
now
to
our
serai
throw
dust
and
mud
over
our
horses
and
dirty
our
clothes
and
taking
two
men
and
a
pony
heavily
laden
with
us
we
will
go
round
the
city
enter
by
the
gate
under
the
old
palace
and
pretending
to
be
weary
halt
close
to
them
we
shall
easily
be
able
to
worm
ourselves
into
their
confidence
and
will
then
accompany
them
you
motee
i
will
leave
in
charge
of
the
band
and
send
you
word
what
road
we
are
to
take
you
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
and
contrive
to
let
the
men
overtake
me
by
twos
and
threes
some
must
go
on
before
so
that
we
may
come
up
to
them
and
in
this
manner
though
the
band
will
be
scattered
yet
inshalla
in
a
few
marches
we
shall
muster
strong
enough
to
do
the
work
we
can
keep
up
a
communication
with
each
other
so
that
when
the
business
is
done
we
can
assemble
and
then
hurry
forward
to
our
home
but
on
no
account
must
you
be
more
than
a
stage
behind
us
and
you
must
contrive
to
reach
our
a
short
time
after
we
have
left
it
now
say
my
friends
will
this
plan
do
or
can
you
advise
any
other
more
practicable
if
so
speak
it
is
excellent
cried
both
and
had
wisdom
for
its
father
no
time
ought
to
be
lost
we
returned
to
our
serai
and
towards
the
afternoon
two
as
and
weary
travellers
in
appearance
as
ever
came
off
a
long
and
fatiguing
march
were
seen
to
enter
the
south
gate
of
boorhanpoor
and
traverse
the
bazars
in
search
of
shelter
these
were
myself
and
peer
khan
attended
by
my
good
lad
junglee
and
two
other
thugs
we
passed
and
the
shed
which
was
a
large
one
in
which
the
rokurreas
were
and
feigning
to
have
been
denied
room
everywhere
that
we
had
applied
i
at
last
rode
up
to
them
and
addressed
myself
to
the
most
respectable
among
them
a
fine
tall
fellow
with
huge
whiskers
and
mustachios
yaro
said
i
you
seem
to
be
travellers
as
well
as
ourselves
and
for
the
love
of
alla
allow
us
a
little
room
to
spread
our
carpets
here
you
have
seen
us
pass
backwards
and
forwards
for
many
times
and
yet
there
is
not
a
soul
who
will
say
to
us
dismount
and
refresh
yourselves
nay
we
have
been
refused
admittance
into
many
empty
places
may
their
owners
sisters
be
defiled
go
to
the
serai
said
the
man
there
is
room
there
and
you
will
be
comfortable
indeed
said
i
we
have
tried
it
already
and
it
is
full
some
forty
or
fifty
fellows
were
in
it
who
bade
us
begone
in
no
measured
terms
and
in
truth
we
liked
not
their
appearance
having
some
valuables
about
us
they
looked
very
like
thieves
or
dacoos
did
they
not
brother
said
i
turning
to
peer
khan
ay
indeed
said
he
who
knows
if
we
had
put
up
among
them
whether
we
should
not
have
had
our
throats
cut
it
was
the
mercy
of
alla
continued
he
looking
up
devoutly
that
the
place
was
full
or
weary
as
we
are
we
should
have
been
right
glad
to
have
rested
ourselves
anywhere
for
indeed
i
can
hardly
sit
on
my
horse
you
see
said
i
how
we
are
situated
hindoos
though
you
be
you
will
not
refuse
us
the
evening
is
drawing
in
and
we
have
ridden
all
day
a
slight
meal
is
all
that
we
can
hope
to
get
and
then
sleep
will
be
welcome
well
said
the
fellow
it
will
be
uncivil
to
turn
you
away
so
alight
and
cried
he
to
one
of
his
companions
do
you
doorjun
and
some
others
move
the
camel
saddles
and
those
bags
nearer
this
way
and
there
will
be
room
for
these
bhula
admees
as
they
were
being
moved
i
heard
the
money
chink
we
dismounted
and
in
a
short
time
our
horses
were
rubbed
down
and
a
meal
prepared
for
we
had
fasted
that
day
on
purpose
when
we
had
eaten
it
behold
us
seated
in
conversation
with
the
rokurreas
and
having
already
possessed
ourselves
of
their
intended
route
we
agreed
to
accompany
them
for
mutual
security
and
in
short
were
on
as
good
terms
with
them
as
if
we
had
travelled
hitherto
together
our
appearance
our
good
horses
and
arms
assured
them
that
we
were
soldiers
for
i
had
told
them
we
were
in
the
service
of
holkar
returning
from
poona
where
we
had
been
on
a
mission
to
the
peshwa
and
bearing
with
us
not
only
despatches
but
some
hoondees
of
large
amount
in
proof
of
this
i
pulled
forth
a
bundle
of
papers
from
my
inner
vest
and
touching
my
head
and
eyes
with
them
praised
the
munificence
of
bajee
rao
and
extolled
the
friendly
terms
he
was
on
with
holkar
this
was
my
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
when
i
was
at
the
serai
and
i
had
hastily
collected
a
bundle
of
and
accounts
made
them
up
into
a
packet
directed
it
to
holkar
and
sealed
it
with
my
own
seal
which
was
as
large
as
that
of
any
prince
in
the
country
by
alla
sahib
they
believed
me
to
be
what
i
represented
as
surely
as
that
they
had
heads
on
their
shoulders
and
forthwith
began
questioning
me
on
the
possibility
of
the
peshwa
and
holkar
uniting
to
overthrow
the
feringhees
but
i
was
mysteriously
close
in
my
replies
just
hinting
that
it
was
possible
and
turning
off
the
conversation
to
the
marks
of
favour
which
had
been
shown
me
by
bajee
rao
about
which
i
told
enough
lies
to
have
choked
myself
and
i
pointed
to
my
own
noble
horse
as
one
of
the
peshwa
gifts
they
all
declared
that
he
was
worthy
of
the
giver
and
of
the
possessor
and
after
agreeing
on
our
stage
for
the
morrow
which
was
distant
eight
coss
they
went
to
sleep
with
the
exception
of
two
who
sat
guarding
the
treasure
with
drawn
swords
and
all
believing
that
they
were
in
company
with
an
unknown
great
personage
before
i
lay
down
to
rest
i
despatched
junglee
with
the
information
to
motee
i
spoke
to
him
openly
in
ramasee
and
he
set
off
on
his
errand
that
is
a
queer
language
said
the
jemadar
of
the
rokurreas
what
is
it
is
teloogoo
said
i
carelessly
i
picked
the
lad
up
at
hyderabad
two
years
ago
for
a
small
sum
and
he
is
my
slave
he
understands
our
hindoo
but
does
not
speak
it
perhaps
it
was
unwise
to
have
done
it
but
i
spoke
in
so
careless
a
manner
that
they
concluded
i
had
sent
him
out
on
some
casual
errand
indeed
i
told
him
to
buy
some
tobacco
and
pan
on
his
way
back
and
as
the
serai
was
not
far
from
where
we
were
the
time
occupied
in
his
going
to
it
would
not
exceed
that
of
an
ordinary
errand
he
returned
with
the
pan
and
tobacco
and
told
me
they
were
ready
but
that
the
majority
would
remain
the
next
day
and
that
seven
of
the
best
under
goordut
were
then
about
to
depart
the
rest
leaving
one
of
their
number
as
a
scout
in
the
village
we
were
to
halt
at
would
push
on
as
far
as
they
could
beyond
i
was
satisfied
and
so
sure
did
i
feel
of
the
success
of
this
adventure
that
i
would
have
wagered
all
i
possessed
that
i
killed
the
rokurreas
in
three
days
we
started
the
next
morning
and
for
two
days
saw
none
of
our
men
however
peer
khan
augured
well
from
it
saying
the
fellows
were
up
to
their
work
and
would
appear
in
good
time
and
that
if
they
came
too
soon
our
companions
would
take
the
alarm
and
be
off
on
the
fourth
day
one
of
our
companions
appeared
we
overtook
him
on
the
road
and
as
i
lagged
purposely
in
the
rear
i
learned
from
him
that
goordut
and
his
remaining
men
were
in
advance
of
us
one
march
and
that
some
would
join
us
that
day
and
the
rest
the
next
this
was
as
it
should
be
four
men
joined
us
at
the
village
we
encamped
at
and
as
we
were
now
nine
to
eight
i
began
to
think
on
the
probability
of
putting
them
to
death
by
violence
i
mean
attacking
them
with
our
swords
on
any
opportunity
which
might
offer
but
it
was
dangerous
as
they
were
individually
stouter
men
than
we
were
good
hands
at
their
weapons
and
as
watchful
as
cats
the
second
day
goordut
and
his
party
joined
us
but
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
persuade
the
rokurreas
to
allow
them
to
travel
in
our
company
they
declared
it
was
directly
against
their
rules
that
we
must
be
aware
of
this
and
that
if
it
was
known
by
their
employers
that
they
even
admitted
one
traveller
into
their
society
on
the
road
they
would
lose
their
reputation
and
means
of
subsistence
but
you
continued
the
jemadar
whose
name
was
bheem
singh
you
are
respectable
persons
who
for
the
honour
of
the
government
you
serve
would
assist
us
against
thieves
or
robbers
and
we
travel
in
your
company
through
these
territories
of
sindia
as
safely
as
though
we
had
a
rissala
of
cavalry
to
guard
us
however
for
our
sakes
let
not
the
tales
of
wayfarers
make
any
impression
on
your
mind
depend
upon
a
experience
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
and
even
when
by
yourself
always
avoid
associating
with
any
one
no
good
can
come
of
it
and
much
harm
may
ensue
i
promised
to
take
his
advice
and
as
i
saw
clearly
that
they
would
not
admit
any
more
of
our
band
into
their
company
and
that
a
quarrel
and
separation
from
them
would
inevitably
be
the
consequence
if
i
persisted
in
forcing
any
more
upon
them
i
determined
to
finish
the
matter
as
i
best
could
with
the
twelve
men
i
had
junglee
was
worth
but
little
at
least
i
counted
not
upon
him
as
he
was
a
mere
stripling
but
the
rest
were
the
very
best
of
my
band
all
noted
bhuttotes
and
fellows
who
had
good
swords
and
knew
right
well
how
to
use
them
in
the
day
therefore
we
had
a
consultation
we
met
in
a
field
of
jowaree
which
concealed
us
and
there
we
discussed
the
affair
peer
khan
proposed
to
send
one
of
the
men
back
for
motee
and
the
rest
to
tell
them
to
pass
us
in
the
night
without
stopping
and
to
allow
us
to
overtake
them
early
in
the
morning
and
as
soon
as
the
two
parties
were
mingled
together
in
passing
each
other
that
i
should
give
the
jhirnee
the
plan
was
very
feasible
and
the
advice
was
good
as
it
placed
the
issue
beyond
a
doubt
i
inclined
to
it
myself
still
there
was
no
honour
to
be
gained
by
it
it
would
be
large
odds
against
a
few
and
this
i
did
not
like
as
i
had
a
choice
in
the
matter
at
last
i
said
after
musing
some
time
and
listening
to
peer
khan
as
he
discussed
the
measure
no
no
peer
khan
we
are
all
of
us
young
and
fame
is
dear
to
us
if
we
kill
these
people
in
the
old
way
and
the
booty
is
large
we
shall
no
doubt
get
praise
but
think
man
on
the
honour
to
be
gained
the
good
name
if
we
risk
ourselves
against
these
fellows
and
are
victorious
will
not
every
thug
in
the
land
cry
shabash
and
wah
wah
and
is
not
this
worth
an
effort
i
tell
you
a
good
name
is
better
than
riches
and
if
it
is
our
time
to
die
we
can
not
avoid
it
by
calling
up
motee
and
his
people
they
are
after
all
only
the
refuse
and
are
we
not
the
picked
men
of
the
band
and
those
on
whom
the
matter
would
fall
even
were
the
whole
now
present
say
therefore
will
ye
risk
your
lives
against
these
fellows
and
fall
on
them
morning
sahib
they
did
not
hesitate
one
and
all
pledged
themselves
to
follow
me
and
die
with
me
should
it
be
their
fate
then
see
your
swords
are
loose
in
their
scabbards
said
i
and
let
each
of
you
plant
himself
within
striking
distance
of
his
enemy
on
his
left
hand
peer
khan
and
myself
are
mounted
and
we
can
not
fail
i
feel
assured
that
there
will
be
no
danger
and
that
we
shall
succeed
we
dispersed
and
rejoined
our
associates
the
evening
was
spent
in
singing
and
playing
on
the
sitar
on
which
two
of
the
rokurreas
and
some
of
my
men
were
adepts
and
we
retired
to
rest
at
a
late
hour
fully
prepared
to
do
our
work
well
and
bravely
on
the
morrow
and
the
morrow
came
and
the
sun
rose
in
splendour
we
set
out
soon
afterwards
for
the
rokurreas
would
not
travel
before
it
had
risen
for
fear
of
surprise
from
thieves
or
dacoos
who
generally
fall
on
travellers
in
the
dark
somewhat
to
my
mortification
two
of
the
rokurreas
mounted
the
camel
they
had
with
them
saying
their
feet
were
cracked
and
sore
and
they
could
not
walk
this
disconcerted
me
for
a
moment
for
i
thought
they
had
suspected
us
and
i
knew
that
most
if
not
all
the
treasure
was
laden
upon
it
but
i
affected
no
surprise
and
was
determined
if
they
showed
the
least
symptoms
of
flight
to
wound
the
camel
and
thereby
prevent
its
getting
away
from
us
by
the
great
speed
i
knew
it
possessed
for
they
had
put
it
to
its
utmost
the
day
before
to
show
me
that
it
could
outstrip
a
horse
we
travelled
along
until
and
the
fatigue
and
heat
made
us
glad
to
dismount
at
a
stream
which
crossed
the
road
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
fall
on
them
but
i
was
disappointed
they
all
kept
together
and
i
was
then
satisfied
that
they
half
suspected
our
intentions
but
i
could
not
delay
the
attack
long
and
was
determined
to
make
it
under
any
circumstances
for
the
rapid
rate
at
which
the
rokurreas
travelled
was
exhausting
my
men
who
had
much
ado
to
keep
up
with
them
by
the
merest
good
luck
about
a
coss
after
we
left
the
nulla
we
entered
on
a
rough
and
stony
track
which
diminished
the
speed
of
the
camel
whose
feet
were
hurt
by
the
stones
and
he
picked
his
way
cautiously
though
i
saw
the
men
on
his
back
used
every
exertion
to
urge
him
on
this
slowness
enabled
my
men
to
take
their
places
and
we
continued
to
proceed
a
short
distance
but
ready
at
any
moment
for
the
onset
i
wished
to
get
as
near
the
camel
as
i
could
in
order
to
prevent
its
escape
but
the
road
became
worse
our
pace
still
slower
and
i
was
satisfied
it
could
not
be
urged
quicker
we
were
at
this
time
all
in
a
group
and
i
saw
that
the
time
had
come
how
my
heart
beat
not
with
fear
sahib
but
with
excitement
excitement
like
that
of
a
gambler
who
has
risked
his
all
on
a
stake
and
who
with
clenched
hands
set
teeth
and
breath
watches
the
turn
of
the
cowrees
which
is
either
to
ruin
him
or
better
his
fortunes
peer
khan
threw
a
glance
towards
me
one
of
the
rokurreas
was
trudging
along
at
his
horse
shoulders
another
was
at
the
same
place
near
mine
and
the
fellows
on
the
camel
with
their
backs
turned
towards
us
were
singing
merrily
one
of
the
wild
lays
of
the
rajpoots
in
which
from
time
to
time
they
were
joined
in
chorus
by
those
on
foot
and
by
some
of
my
men
who
knew
the
words
junglee
was
close
behind
the
camel
leading
my
pony
and
the
others
in
the
rear
but
all
in
their
places
i
cast
but
one
look
behind
to
see
that
they
were
so
and
being
satisfied
i
gave
the
jhirnee
junglee
pan
lao
i
cried
with
a
loud
voice
the
swords
of
my
party
flashed
brightly
from
their
scabbards
and
in
an
instant
were
buried
deeply
in
the
bodies
of
their
victims
and
crimsoned
with
gore
as
for
myself
i
had
cloven
the
skull
of
the
fellow
beneath
me
and
my
sword
sticking
in
the
wound
escaped
from
my
hand
as
he
fell
i
threw
myself
from
my
horse
to
recover
it
and
only
then
saw
the
camel
prostrate
on
the
ground
moaning
terribly
the
men
upon
it
had
fallen
with
it
but
both
had
gained
their
legs
one
had
thrown
himself
upon
junglee
and
the
poor
lad
waged
an
unequal
combat
with
him
the
other
rushed
on
me
with
his
sword
uplifted
sahib
i
thought
my
end
was
come
but
i
had
time
to
disengage
my
shield
from
my
back
and
held
it
before
me
in
defence
while
i
tugged
in
very
desperation
at
my
weapon
praise
be
to
alla
it
yielded
to
my
great
exertion
and
we
were
on
equal
terms
i
have
before
told
you
of
my
skill
as
a
swordsman
but
i
had
met
my
match
in
the
rokurrea
he
though
all
his
men
were
lying
around
him
save
one
who
having
sorely
wounded
my
poor
attendant
was
now
closely
pressed
by
peer
khan
and
another
was
as
cool
and
wary
as
myself
we
fought
well
and
for
a
long
time
the
contest
was
equal
we
were
both
out
of
breath
and
our
shields
hacked
with
the
repeated
blows
we
had
each
caught
on
them
at
last
as
my
foot
slipped
on
a
stone
he
made
a
stroke
at
my
head
the
blow
was
weak
from
his
exhausted
state
or
it
would
have
ended
me
it
cut
through
my
turban
and
slightly
wounded
my
head
i
did
not
fall
though
i
was
somewhat
stunned
by
the
stroke
he
might
have
taken
advantage
of
the
moment
yet
he
neglected
it
maddened
by
the
thought
of
defeat
i
rushed
on
him
and
by
the
violence
of
my
attack
forced
him
backward
at
last
he
too
slipped
as
he
retreated
and
lost
his
balance
he
raised
his
sword
wildly
in
the
air
to
recover
himself
but
i
did
not
lose
my
opportunity
as
he
had
done
my
blow
descended
with
its
full
force
increased
by
a
sudden
leap
i
made
towards
him
and
he
fell
to
the
earth
cloven
through
the
neck
and
shoulder
he
was
dead
almost
ere
he
fell
a
moment
i
gazed
on
the
features
of
the
brave
rajpoot
and
then
sought
my
poor
lad
from
whom
the
was
fast
ebbing
away
his
wound
was
also
in
the
neck
and
the
blood
rushing
into
his
throat
was
choking
him
i
tried
to
stanch
it
with
my
waistband
but
ineffectually
it
relieved
him
for
a
moment
and
he
asked
for
water
a
leathern
bag
containing
some
had
been
tied
to
the
camel
by
one
of
the
men
and
i
put
the
mouth
of
it
to
his
lips
he
drank
a
little
and
sat
up
supported
by
goordut
i
am
killed
said
he
jemadar
i
die
my
own
blood
chokes
me
i
can
not
recover
do
not
leave
my
body
to
be
eaten
by
the
beasts
but
bury
it
that
fellow
continued
he
after
a
short
interval
and
pointing
to
one
of
the
dead
that
fellow
sword
killed
me
i
cut
the
hind
sinews
of
the
camel
leg
and
it
fell
i
thought
they
would
both
be
stunned
but
he
got
up
and
attacked
me
and
i
was
no
match
for
him
all
the
rest
of
you
were
engaged
or
you
would
have
helped
me
but
it
was
my
fate
to
die
and
i
felt
it
yesterday
the
bitterness
of
death
then
passed
over
me
but
now
i
am
content
the
pain
will
soon
be
over
here
he
sunk
insensible
and
we
stood
around
him
weeping
for
he
was
an
affectionate
lad
and
we
all
loved
him
as
a
brother
but
he
recovered
again
slightly
though
the
rattle
was
in
his
throat
and
the
blood
hardly
allowed
him
to
speak
my
mother
he
said
faintly
jemadar
my
mother
you
know
her
and
my
little
sister
they
will
starve
now
but
you
will
protect
them
for
poor
junglee
sake
and
he
strove
to
bend
his
head
on
my
hand
as
though
to
supplicate
my
assistance
for
them
fear
not
said
i
they
shall
be
well
cared
for
and
while
ameer
ali
lives
they
shall
know
no
want
but
i
could
hardly
speak
for
weeping
for
i
knew
the
old
woman
and
many
were
the
prayers
she
made
for
his
safe
return
as
she
confided
him
to
my
care
alas
how
should
we
be
able
to
tell
her
his
fate
the
poor
boy
was
satisfied
with
my
words
he
would
fain
have
replied
to
them
and
his
lips
moved
but
a
torrent
of
blood
checked
his
utterance
and
raising
his
dull
and
glazed
eyes
to
mine
he
bowed
his
head
on
my
hand
and
died
in
the
effort
now
said
i
to
the
assembled
thugs
i
here
swear
to
one
thing
and
ye
are
none
of
mine
unless
ye
agree
to
it
i
swear
that
whatever
share
would
have
come
to
this
poor
lad
it
shall
be
doubled
for
his
mother
as
yet
we
know
not
what
it
is
but
whatever
it
be
it
shall
be
doubled
we
agree
cried
all
nay
every
man
of
us
will
add
to
it
what
we
can
had
junglee
not
hamstrung
the
camel
which
none
of
us
thought
of
doing
it
might
nay
would
have
escaped
for
we
saw
its
speed
yesterday
and
the
two
good
rajpoots
who
were
on
it
would
have
carried
it
off
ye
are
my
own
brothers
for
this
good
promise
i
said
and
now
some
of
you
dig
a
grave
for
the
poor
lad
we
must
unload
that
beast
and
strip
the
bodies
for
myself
i
am
in
some
pain
and
will
wash
my
head
and
tie
up
the
cut
so
set
about
your
work
quickly
the
camel
still
lay
groaning
they
tried
to
raise
it
up
but
in
vain
the
stroke
had
divided
the
sinew
above
the
hock
and
it
could
not
raise
itself
so
one
of
the
men
cut
its
throat
and
ended
its
pain
the
bags
of
treasure
were
transferred
to
my
pony
and
peer
khan
horse
and
mine
and
every
man
also
filled
his
waistband
so
that
we
were
enabled
to
carry
it
all
off
we
took
the
swords
of
the
rajpoots
but
everything
else
and
their
bodies
were
dragged
into
the
jungle
to
some
distance
and
hastily
covered
with
earth
and
stones
the
bloody
earth
on
the
scene
of
the
conflict
was
collected
and
thrown
away
and
in
a
very
short
time
nothing
remained
to
mark
the
spot
but
the
carcass
of
the
camel
which
we
could
not
dispose
of
and
leaving
the
usual
marks
for
the
guidance
of
motee
and
his
party
we
continued
our
march
on
the
main
road
ah
how
great
was
our
joy
when
before
we
reached
the
stage
we
were
to
encamp
at
and
as
we
sat
at
the
edge
of
a
stream
washing
ourselves
we
saw
on
the
brow
of
a
rising
ground
we
had
just
passed
our
party
coming
up
they
ran
towards
us
in
breathless
anxiety
and
hope
motee
was
first
and
he
threw
himself
into
my
arms
we
hastened
on
he
said
from
the
last
stage
hoping
to
overtake
you
in
time
and
when
we
saw
the
dead
camel
how
great
was
our
suspense
till
we
could
find
you
we
saw
the
traces
of
the
conflict
and
some
blood
which
had
escaped
your
notice
which
i
have
removed
and
that
added
to
our
anxiety
but
davee
be
praised
we
have
found
you
at
last
and
you
are
all
safe
is
it
not
so
not
quite
i
said
we
have
lost
poor
junglee
who
was
killed
in
the
fight
and
i
am
wounded
but
is
only
a
slight
cut
and
a
few
days
will
heal
it
some
of
the
treasure
was
instantly
distributed
to
the
other
ponies
and
encamping
outside
the
village
when
we
reached
it
after
the
accustomed
sacrifice
i
had
my
small
tent
pitched
and
all
the
treasure
was
conveyed
to
it
one
by
one
the
bags
were
opened
and
glorious
indeed
was
the
booty
well
worth
the
risk
we
had
encountered
it
consisted
of
dollars
gold
mohurs
and
rupees
to
the
value
of
sixty
thousand
rupees
in
all
and
there
were
also
six
strings
of
large
pearls
in
a
small
box
sewn
up
in
which
could
not
be
worth
less
than
ten
thousand
more
i
need
not
describe
our
joy
we
had
comfort
nay
affluence
before
us
for
years
and
every
one
sat
and
gazed
at
the
heap
of
treasure
in
silent
thankfulness
finally
it
was
all
collected
and
put
into
bags
which
i
sealed
with
my
own
seal
we
now
hurried
to
our
home
for
we
sought
no
adventure
nor
needed
any
only
two
unfortunate
wretches
who
insisted
on
joining
us
were
killed
and
in
less
than
a
month
we
were
within
three
marches
of
our
village
i
despatched
a
man
in
advance
to
give
notice
of
our
approach
and
alla
how
my
heart
beat
with
love
and
fond
anxiety
to
see
azima
and
to
press
once
more
my
children
to
my
heart
after
all
the
perils
i
had
encountered
how
intense
was
my
anxiety
to
reach
my
own
threshold
when
i
saw
the
grove
appear
in
view
the
spot
from
whence
i
had
departed
so
full
of
hope
and
the
walls
and
white
musjid
of
the
village
peeping
from
amidst
the
trees
by
which
they
were
surrounded
i
urged
my
horse
into
a
gallop
and
i
saw
my
father
and
moedeen
approaching
to
meet
me
to
give
me
the
the
welcome
of
return
but
as
i
neared
them
they
hung
their
heads
and
advanced
with
slow
and
mournful
steps
a
sudden
pang
shot
through
my
heart
i
threw
myself
from
my
horse
and
ran
towards
them
my
father
was
weeping
speak
for
the
sake
of
alla
i
cried
what
can
this
be
oh
say
the
worst
at
once
and
tell
me
is
azima
dead
this
suspense
will
kill
me
a
few
words
only
the
old
man
spake
as
he
told
me
that
my
child
my
beautiful
boy
was
dead
and
ameer
ali
wept
chapter
xxxii
although
the
mind
would
ordinarily
reject
sympathy
with
the
joys
or
sorrows
of
a
murderer
like
ameer
ali
one
so
deeply
stained
with
crime
of
the
most
revolting
nature
yet
for
the
moment
i
was
moved
to
see
that
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
twenty
years
by
his
account
the
simple
mention
of
the
death
of
his
favourite
child
could
so
much
affect
him
even
to
tears
and
they
were
genuine
i
leave
others
to
speculate
on
the
peculiar
frame
of
the
thug
mind
how
this
one
feeling
of
tenderness
escaped
being
choked
by
the
rank
guilt
that
had
sprung
up
around
it
and
will
pursue
my
relation
of
his
adventures
sahib
he
said
why
should
i
now
trouble
you
with
an
account
of
my
miserable
meeting
with
my
loved
azima
you
can
picture
it
to
yourself
our
souls
had
been
bound
up
in
that
boy
and
it
was
long
ere
we
could
bring
ourselves
to
submit
to
the
blow
which
the
hand
of
alla
had
inflicted
but
the
poignancy
of
the
grief
passed
away
and
our
girl
growing
up
in
beauty
occupied
our
thoughts
and
engaged
our
care
and
attention
some
time
after
we
returned
my
father
one
day
came
to
me
and
with
concern
on
his
countenance
declared
there
was
a
rumour
that
we
were
suspected
and
that
he
thought
our
village
was
no
longer
a
safe
abode
for
us
we
could
risk
nothing
there
might
or
might
not
be
truth
in
the
report
but
it
was
our
duty
to
secure
a
safe
asylum
and
accordingly
he
and
i
set
out
to
make
a
tour
of
the
different
states
as
yet
independent
of
the
english
and
to
find
out
whether
any
of
their
rulers
would
allow
us
a
residence
on
payment
of
a
fixed
tribute
such
as
our
fraternity
had
used
to
pay
to
sindia
government
when
our
village
belonged
to
that
prince
we
accordingly
departed
and
after
visiting
many
rulers
in
bundelkund
for
we
were
averse
to
going
farther
from
our
home
we
were
received
by
the
rajah
of
jhalone
and
were
introduced
to
him
by
ganesha
jemadar
who
was
under
his
protection
and
who
made
him
handsome
returns
from
the
booty
he
collected
for
his
friendly
conduct
our
negotiation
was
a
long
one
the
rajah
was
fearful
for
some
time
of
the
consequences
of
harbouring
us
or
pretended
to
be
so
in
order
to
enhance
the
favour
he
was
conferring
but
we
distributed
bribes
plentifully
to
his
attendants
and
confidential
servants
and
at
last
succeeded
in
our
object
we
were
to
pay
a
tax
of
three
hundred
rupees
a
year
to
his
government
present
him
with
anything
rare
or
valuable
we
might
pick
up
and
to
preserve
appearances
my
father
agreed
to
farm
three
villages
situated
a
short
distance
from
his
capital
the
whole
concluded
by
our
presenting
to
him
one
of
the
strings
of
pearls
we
had
taken
on
the
last
expedition
my
own
beautiful
sword
and
other
articles
valued
at
nearly
five
thousand
rupees
when
we
were
thus
mutually
satisfied
my
father
and
some
of
the
men
remained
behind
while
i
and
the
rest
returned
to
our
village
to
bring
away
our
families
i
confess
i
left
our
home
with
regret
many
many
happy
days
had
been
passed
there
and
we
were
beloved
by
the
villagers
to
whom
we
had
endeared
ourselves
by
our
inoffensive
conduct
we
were
now
to
seek
a
new
country
and
form
new
ties
and
connections
a
disagreeable
matter
under
any
circumstances
but
my
father
wisdom
had
saved
us
the
information
the
english
officers
had
obtained
alla
only
knows
how
was
correct
in
a
very
few
months
after
we
were
settled
in
our
new
abode
we
heard
that
the
whole
purgunna
of
murnae
had
been
attacked
village
by
village
many
of
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
thugs
had
died
defending
their
homes
the
survivors
had
fled
routed
and
utterly
disorganized
and
had
taken
refuge
with
those
who
had
made
previous
settlements
as
we
had
done
for
my
own
part
so
long
as
my
money
lasted
i
was
in
no
humour
to
expose
myself
to
fresh
risks
i
had
too
attained
the
highest
rank
possible
among
thugs
for
i
had
been
declared
a
soobehdar
immediately
upon
my
return
from
the
last
expedition
and
i
was
content
to
enjoy
my
ease
and
assist
my
father
in
the
management
of
the
villages
which
had
been
confided
to
us
and
by
which
we
realized
a
comfortable
income
for
the
time
therefore
thuggee
was
abandoned
and
though
often
urged
by
ganesha
who
had
a
wild
and
restless
spirit
to
join
him
in
an
expedition
we
refrained
from
doing
so
and
lived
peacefully
and
respectably
there
was
something
about
ganesha
which
to
me
was
mysterious
and
the
instant
i
saw
him
at
the
court
of
the
rajah
a
thought
flashed
into
my
mind
that
i
had
met
him
before
under
painful
circumstances
in
spite
of
all
my
endeavours
i
could
hardly
ever
shake
it
off
sufficiently
to
be
on
any
terms
of
cordiality
with
him
and
i
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust
his
intimacy
with
my
father
and
the
evident
effect
his
counsels
had
upon
him
in
person
ganesha
was
tall
and
strong
but
his
face
was
more
forbidding
than
any
one
i
had
ever
before
seen
and
there
was
a
savage
ferocity
about
his
manner
which
disgusted
me
but
let
him
pass
at
present
he
has
now
little
to
do
with
my
story
hereafter
i
shall
be
obliged
to
bring
him
prominently
and
disagreeably
before
you
nearly
three
years
passed
quietly
and
unmarked
by
anything
which
i
can
recall
to
my
memory
i
had
no
more
children
and
my
daughter
was
growing
up
a
model
of
beauty
and
grace
i
was
happy
and
never
should
have
dreamed
of
leaving
home
had
it
not
been
for
the
bad
faith
of
the
rajah
and
one
unfortunate
season
of
drought
by
the
former
we
were
obliged
to
pay
five
thousand
rupees
which
he
demanded
under
threats
of
discovering
us
and
by
the
latter
we
lost
considerably
in
the
villages
we
farmed
which
were
now
seven
in
number
and
for
which
he
obliged
us
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
revenue
these
sums
seriously
diminished
our
resources
and
i
began
to
look
about
me
for
men
to
compose
a
band
to
go
in
search
of
more
plunder
but
they
were
not
easily
collected
for
my
own
men
had
dispersed
to
distant
parts
of
the
country
and
could
not
be
brought
together
save
at
great
expense
and
sacrifice
of
time
just
at
this
period
it
was
rumoured
through
the
country
that
cheetoo
and
other
pindharee
chiefs
of
note
would
assemble
their
forces
after
the
rains
at
the
festival
of
the
dussera
and
had
planned
an
expedition
of
greater
magnitude
than
any
ever
before
undertaken
an
expedition
which
was
sure
to
enrich
all
its
members
and
strike
terror
into
the
english
government
the
idea
suited
me
exactly
i
was
a
soldier
by
inclination
if
not
by
profession
and
i
thought
if
i
could
join
any
of
the
durras
with
a
few
choice
men
well
mounted
we
might
make
as
good
a
thing
of
it
as
if
we
went
out
on
an
expedition
of
our
own
the
latter
scheme
moreover
promised
no
success
for
the
roads
would
be
infested
by
straggling
parties
of
pindharees
who
were
well
known
to
spare
neither
travellers
nor
thugs
they
looked
on
the
last
indeed
with
great
enmity
accordingly
i
set
to
work
to
make
my
preparations
peer
khan
and
motee
still
remained
near
us
and
when
i
disclosed
my
plans
to
them
they
entered
into
them
with
great
readiness
and
alacrity
they
had
enough
money
to
mount
themselves
well
and
after
a
short
absence
returned
fully
equipped
for
the
journey
i
had
told
them
to
look
out
for
a
few
really
fine
fellows
to
accompany
us
whom
they
brought
but
our
united
means
would
not
allow
of
our
purchasing
horses
for
them
and
on
foot
they
would
be
of
no
use
in
debating
on
our
dilemma
an
idea
occurred
to
me
that
the
rajah
would
perhaps
lend
or
sell
the
horses
on
the
promise
of
after
and
double
payment
i
had
heard
of
such
things
and
i
determined
to
try
what
could
be
done
to
my
great
joy
the
rajah
consented
and
with
less
difficulty
than
i
had
anticipated
for
i
had
become
a
great
favourite
with
him
i
was
allowed
to
take
five
horses
from
his
stables
which
were
valued
at
three
hundred
rupees
each
with
their
saddles
and
accoutrements
and
this
sum
was
to
be
doubled
in
case
we
returned
successful
the
rajah
indeed
thanked
me
for
the
hint
i
had
given
him
and
many
others
obtained
horses
on
the
same
terms
on
giving
security
for
the
performance
of
the
conditions
under
which
they
took
them
my
final
arrangements
were
soon
completed
we
were
all
armed
and
accoutred
in
the
handsomest
manner
we
could
afford
and
a
or
more
little
party
never
set
out
in
quest
of
adventure
than
i
and
my
seven
associates
before
we
started
we
consulted
the
omens
which
were
favourable
and
we
performed
all
the
ceremonies
of
departure
exactly
as
if
we
had
been
going
on
an
expedition
of
thuggee
in
due
time
we
arrived
at
nemawur
the
residence
of
cheetoo
here
were
collected
men
from
every
part
of
hindostan
as
various
in
their
tribes
as
they
were
in
their
dresses
arms
and
accoutrements
the
country
round
nemawur
was
full
of
them
and
the
town
itself
appeared
a
moving
mass
of
human
beings
attracted
by
the
hope
of
active
service
and
above
all
of
plunder
we
lost
no
time
in
presenting
ourselves
at
the
durbar
of
the
chief
and
were
graciously
received
by
him
i
opened
our
conference
in
the
usual
manner
by
presenting
the
hilt
of
my
sword
as
a
nuzzur
and
having
dressed
myself
in
my
richest
clothes
i
was
instantly
welcomed
as
if
i
had
been
a
sirdar
of
rank
and
had
the
command
not
of
seven
men
but
of
as
many
hundreds
cheetoo
was
a
man
and
a
gallant
leader
he
ought
to
have
died
on
the
field
of
battle
instead
of
in
the
miserable
manner
he
did
no
man
that
ever
led
a
lubhur
was
juster
in
the
division
of
plunder
no
one
was
ever
more
attentive
to
the
wants
and
complaints
of
those
under
him
than
was
cheetoo
pindharee
it
was
this
which
gained
him
so
many
followers
while
his
personal
activity
and
hardihood
stimulated
his
soldiers
to
exertion
and
emulation
nothing
could
tire
him
often
have
i
seen
him
after
a
long
and
weary
march
when
it
was
as
much
as
most
of
us
could
do
to
sit
on
our
horses
dash
out
to
the
front
and
exercise
his
noble
steed
which
bore
him
gallantly
as
though
he
were
only
returning
from
a
morning
ride
of
a
few
miles
cheetoo
was
as
i
said
struck
with
my
appearance
as
i
introduced
myself
as
a
poor
syud
of
jhalone
desirous
of
serving
under
him
in
his
ensuing
campaign
oh
said
he
from
jhalone
you
have
travelled
far
my
friend
but
nevertheless
you
are
welcome
as
every
brave
cavalier
is
who
brings
a
good
horse
and
a
willing
heart
to
the
service
of
cheetoo
you
know
my
conditions
of
service
i
give
no
pay
but
as
much
plunder
as
your
own
activity
can
procure
the
people
will
tell
you
what
my
share
of
it
is
and
i
look
to
your
honesty
for
your
face
belies
you
if
you
are
a
rogue
i
know
the
conditions
said
i
and
will
accept
them
but
i
have
brought
a
few
friends
with
me
who
are
desirous
of
sharing
my
fortunes
and
if
it
be
the
pleasure
of
the
huzoor
i
will
bring
them
surely
he
replied
but
now
i
am
engaged
meet
me
with
your
men
at
the
place
of
assembly
in
the
evening
and
i
will
see
them
and
your
horses
for
the
station
i
shall
allot
you
in
the
durra
depends
on
their
fitness
i
made
my
obeisance
and
retired
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
cheetoo
sirdars
a
man
by
name
ghuffoor
khan
a
perfect
savage
in
appearance
and
deportment
a
fellow
who
had
pindharee
written
on
his
face
and
had
served
with
much
distinction
in
the
durras
of
dost
mahomed
and
kureem
khan
he
had
introduced
me
to
cheetoo
and
now
as
he
accompanied
me
from
the
durbar
he
gave
me
instructions
how
i
was
to
proceed
you
will
meet
us
he
said
on
the
plain
beyond
the
town
and
see
that
all
your
horses
look
well
that
your
men
are
well
dressed
and
armed
and
i
will
venture
to
declare
that
you
are
all
placed
in
my
division
which
has
the
honour
of
leading
and
is
the
first
for
fighting
and
for
plunder
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
and
i
will
try
whether
i
can
not
get
you
the
command
of
a
hundred
or
two
of
my
own
risala
we
want
leaders
and
from
your
appearance
i
judge
that
you
will
do
justice
to
my
patronage
it
is
the
very
thing
i
have
ever
wished
for
i
said
and
if
you
will
but
favour
me
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
please
you
it
is
true
i
have
as
yet
seen
no
service
but
that
is
easily
learned
when
the
heart
is
willing
we
separated
and
i
hastened
to
my
men
to
get
them
in
readiness
for
the
inspection
of
our
new
chief
our
horses
had
now
rested
from
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
and
were
in
high
condition
our
arms
were
cleaned
and
sharpened
we
provided
ourselves
with
the
long
spear
which
is
peculiar
to
the
pindharees
and
of
which
thousands
were
on
sale
and
at
the
appointed
hour
i
led
my
little
band
to
the
place
where
some
hundred
horsemen
were
already
assembled
i
had
dressed
myself
in
the
armour
of
subzee
khan
which
was
a
magnificent
suit
and
my
noble
horse
as
he
bounded
and
caracoled
with
me
seemed
proud
of
his
rider
and
glad
that
he
had
at
last
got
into
a
scene
suited
to
his
fiery
spirit
peer
khan
and
motee
were
also
striking
figures
and
nearly
as
well
mounted
as
i
was
and
the
rest
were
as
good
if
not
better
than
the
majority
of
those
who
were
now
assembled
keep
all
together
said
i
to
them
do
not
straggle
or
our
party
will
appear
more
insignificant
than
it
really
is
when
you
see
the
chief
coming
watch
my
movements
and
follow
me
long
before
sunset
cheetoo
issued
from
the
town
accompanied
by
as
gallant
a
company
as
could
well
be
imagined
the
leaders
of
the
different
durras
were
all
around
him
each
surpassing
the
other
in
the
richness
and
martial
air
of
his
dress
his
arms
and
the
trappings
of
his
horse
before
him
making
his
horse
leap
and
bound
in
a
wonderful
manner
rode
ghuffoor
khan
clad
in
which
glittered
in
the
red
rays
of
the
setting
sun
no
one
equalled
him
in
appearance
though
many
were
cavaliers
and
no
one
appeared
to
manage
his
steed
with
the
ease
and
grace
that
he
did
that
is
the
man
i
cried
with
enthusiasm
to
peer
khan
that
is
the
man
we
are
to
serve
under
is
he
not
a
gallant
fellow
now
follow
me
and
i
gave
my
impatient
horse
the
rein
and
dashing
onwards
was
in
an
instant
at
the
side
of
cheetoo
accompanied
by
my
men
i
dropped
my
spear
to
the
ground
as
i
threw
my
horse
back
on
his
haunches
close
to
him
and
making
an
obeisance
down
to
my
said
that
i
had
brought
my
men
as
he
had
directed
and
awaited
his
orders
cheetoo
checked
his
horse
and
for
a
moment
surveyed
me
with
delight
you
are
a
fine
young
fellow
he
said
at
length
and
your
men
are
excellently
mounted
i
would
there
were
as
many
hundreds
of
you
as
you
have
companions
however
something
may
be
done
what
say
you
ghuffoor
khan
will
the
meer
sahib
serve
with
you
and
have
you
a
few
hundred
men
to
put
under
him
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
cried
the
khan
is
the
very
thing
your
servant
would
have
proposed
i
liked
the
meer
sahib
from
the
moment
i
saw
him
and
now
that
he
is
properly
dressed
by
alla
he
is
a
very
roostum
and
the
only
fit
companion
for
himself
forgive
my
insolence
that
ghuffoor
khan
sees
then
be
it
so
said
cheetoo
take
him
with
you
and
see
that
you
treat
him
kindly
come
cried
the
khan
to
me
come
then
meer
sahib
take
a
from
one
of
those
fellows
here
is
a
rare
piece
of
ground
and
i
must
see
whether
you
are
master
of
your
weapon
i
fear
not
said
i
i
know
little
about
the
spear
on
foot
and
with
the
sword
i
should
not
fear
the
best
man
of
the
army
nevertheless
to
please
you
i
will
try
i
took
the
spear
a
long
light
bamboo
with
a
large
stuffed
ball
of
cotton
at
the
end
of
it
from
which
depended
a
number
of
small
streamers
of
red
cloth
and
following
ghuffoor
khan
dashed
forwards
into
the
plain
we
pursued
each
other
alternately
now
advancing
to
the
attack
now
retreating
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
assembled
horsemen
who
looked
on
with
curiosity
to
see
how
an
utter
stranger
would
behave
against
the
most
accomplished
cavalier
of
the
army
for
a
long
time
neither
of
us
had
any
advantage
over
the
other
our
horses
were
admirably
trained
and
neither
allowed
the
other
to
approach
within
reach
of
the
this
was
the
great
nicety
of
the
tilt
and
cries
of
shabash
shabash
resounded
at
every
baffling
turn
or
successful
escape
from
a
meditated
blow
at
last
the
khan
touched
me
it
was
but
a
graze
which
i
received
on
my
arm
having
delayed
for
an
instant
to
turn
my
horse
and
he
cried
out
that
he
had
won
i
own
it
said
i
as
our
horses
stood
panting
for
breath
for
i
am
as
you
know
a
novice
at
the
use
of
the
weapon
yet
if
you
will
give
me
another
trial
i
will
again
cross
spears
with
you
and
see
if
i
have
not
better
luck
good
cried
he
laughing
but
look
out
for
i
warn
you
i
shall
not
be
merciful
a
sharp
blow
on
the
ribs
of
a
young
hand
teaches
him
his
vulnerable
point
and
causes
him
to
be
careful
ever
after
come
on
cried
i
if
i
can
i
will
return
the
compliment
we
again
took
a
large
circle
and
at
a
good
canter
approached
each
other
till
we
were
nearly
within
the
khan
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
made
several
desperate
lunges
at
me
i
avoided
them
however
by
the
quickness
of
my
horse
and
i
plainly
saw
that
he
could
by
no
endeavour
approach
near
enough
to
me
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
his
horse
too
being
fatter
was
more
blown
than
my
own
and
after
allowing
him
to
weary
it
still
more
for
some
time
in
a
vain
pursuit
of
me
i
suddenly
changed
my
position
and
became
his
assailant
i
believe
i
was
more
cool
and
wary
than
he
was
for
he
appeared
vexed
that
a
stranger
should
be
on
such
equal
terms
with
him
at
his
favourite
exercise
he
did
not
parry
my
lunges
with
the
same
precision
as
in
the
first
encounter
when
notwithstanding
all
my
efforts
to
touch
him
he
avoided
and
laughed
at
me
still
i
had
not
touched
him
and
growing
weary
of
my
close
pursuit
he
endeavoured
to
turn
again
and
become
the
assailant
but
whether
his
horse
was
slow
in
wheeling
round
or
whether
i
was
too
near
to
allow
of
his
avoiding
the
blow
i
know
not
but
as
he
endeavoured
to
cross
behind
me
i
wheeled
my
horse
suddenly
struck
my
heels
into
his
sides
and
as
he
gave
his
accustomed
bound
of
some
yards
struck
my
spear
full
on
the
broad
chest
of
the
khan
who
was
somewhat
stunned
by
the
blow
a
loud
shout
from
those
around
us
proclaimed
my
victory
and
the
khan
himself
though
abashed
at
his
defeat
was
one
of
the
loudest
in
my
praises
to
the
chief
himself
by
alla
said
he
thou
art
no
stranger
at
this
work
meer
sahib
thou
hast
played
me
a
trick
i
swear
by
your
beard
and
the
koran
that
i
have
not
khan
i
cried
it
was
the
result
of
chance
alla
knows
that
two
days
ago
i
had
never
had
a
spear
in
my
hand
i
only
observed
what
you
did
when
you
hit
me
and
to
my
good
horse
i
owe
my
fortune
but
it
was
all
chance
and
though
i
prize
the
victory
yet
i
regret
that
such
a
chance
should
have
hurt
you
nay
i
am
not
hurt
syud
he
replied
and
i
bear
these
things
with
good
humour
but
if
you
are
as
good
a
hand
with
the
sword
as
you
promise
to
be
with
the
spear
there
will
not
be
a
man
in
the
camp
to
stand
before
you
it
would
be
boastful
in
me
to
challenge
any
one
said
i
seeing
that
i
am
a
stranger
among
you
yet
if
the
noble
cheetoo
wishes
to
try
me
i
will
essay
what
i
can
do
good
good
cried
all
and
cheetoo
himself
vastly
pleased
with
the
result
of
my
encounter
with
ghuffoor
khan
bade
me
present
myself
early
at
his
residence
where
he
would
invite
a
few
good
swordsmen
to
attend
and
see
us
exercise
chapter
xxxiii
the
next
afternoon
we
were
all
assembled
on
a
small
plain
outside
the
town
cheetoo
had
spread
his
carpet
after
the
manner
of
a
pindharee
and
sat
with
his
chiefs
around
him
promising
by
his
demeanour
to
be
an
eager
spectator
of
the
encounter
he
was
remarkably
civil
to
me
and
asked
me
to
sit
by
him
until
a
few
men
who
were
ready
had
displayed
their
dexterity
and
prowess
on
the
signal
being
given
by
him
two
stout
rajpoots
leaped
into
the
circle
and
clattered
their
sticks
on
each
other
shield
for
some
time
without
either
touching
the
other
does
this
please
you
said
cheetoo
to
me
those
fellows
are
good
hands
you
see
at
their
weapons
neither
would
have
drawn
blood
had
they
had
swords
in
their
hands
they
are
expert
enough
said
i
but
methinks
they
have
played
together
before
and
know
each
other
ways
they
make
a
great
show
but
if
i
may
be
pardoned
i
think
neither
has
much
real
skill
if
my
lord
wishes
i
will
try
either
of
them
take
care
you
are
not
overmatched
said
he
i
would
not
have
your
fair
fame
sullied
you
have
already
interested
me
much
in
your
behalf
do
not
fear
for
me
said
i
i
will
do
my
best
i
stripped
myself
to
my
trousers
and
girding
a
handkerchief
tightly
about
my
waist
i
stepped
into
the
circle
where
one
of
the
men
who
had
now
rested
from
his
first
encounter
awaited
me
i
took
a
stick
and
a
small
shield
made
of
from
peer
khan
who
had
brought
them
and
advanced
to
the
centre
there
were
murmurs
among
the
assembly
that
i
was
overmatched
for
they
contrasted
my
slight
form
with
the
tall
and
brawny
one
of
my
antagonist
but
i
was
not
to
be
deterred
by
this
i
knew
my
skill
and
that
mere
personal
strength
would
avail
but
little
against
it
how
is
it
to
be
said
i
to
the
rajpoot
does
the
first
fair
blow
decide
between
us
certainly
he
replied
i
shall
strike
hard
so
be
on
your
guard
good
said
i
now
take
your
post
he
did
he
retired
to
one
edge
of
the
circle
and
advanced
on
me
leisurely
now
stooping
and
leaning
his
on
his
knee
as
he
rested
a
moment
to
survey
me
and
now
circling
round
me
first
rising
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
and
waving
his
stick
in
the
air
i
stood
perfectly
still
and
in
a
careless
attitude
but
well
on
my
guard
for
i
knew
that
i
should
hazard
something
in
moving
after
him
it
was
evident
to
me
he
did
not
expect
this
for
he
seemed
for
a
moment
irresolute
but
at
last
he
rushed
on
me
with
two
or
three
bounds
and
aimed
a
blow
at
my
head
i
was
perfectly
prepared
for
i
knew
his
mode
of
attack
i
received
the
blow
on
my
shield
caught
the
stick
under
it
and
rained
such
a
shower
of
blows
on
his
undefended
person
as
completely
astonished
him
the
assembly
rang
with
plaudits
and
the
other
rajpoot
stepped
forward
and
saluted
me
you
have
had
but
short
work
with
my
friend
bheem
singh
said
he
but
now
you
must
try
me
i
am
ready
i
replied
so
get
to
your
post
i
had
now
an
antagonist
worthy
of
me
he
knew
my
system
of
play
and
verily
i
thought
myself
for
the
moment
engaged
with
my
old
instructor
but
i
had
used
to
vanquish
him
and
i
did
not
fear
the
man
before
me
we
were
soon
hotly
engaged
he
was
as
cool
and
wary
as
myself
and
after
a
long
conflict
in
which
neither
had
the
advantage
we
rested
awhile
both
out
of
breath
enough
enough
cried
cheetoo
you
have
both
done
bravely
neither
has
won
and
you
had
better
let
the
matter
stand
as
it
is
not
so
khodawund
said
i
let
us
finish
it
one
of
us
must
win
and
my
friend
here
desires
as
much
as
myself
to
see
which
of
us
is
the
better
man
is
it
not
so
ay
said
the
fellow
laughingly
the
nuwab
sahib
knows
that
no
one
as
yet
has
overcome
me
but
i
have
fairly
met
my
match
and
whoever
taught
you
was
a
good
master
and
has
had
a
disciple
worthy
of
him
as
you
will
said
cheetoo
only
play
in
good
humour
let
no
feud
grow
out
of
it
we
both
saluted
him
and
assured
him
we
could
not
quarrel
and
that
whoever
was
victor
must
entertain
a
high
respect
for
his
opponent
and
to
it
we
set
again
as
we
had
now
recovered
our
breath
victory
for
a
long
time
hovered
between
us
now
inclining
to
the
one
and
now
to
the
other
we
had
both
lost
our
footing
once
or
twice
and
the
spectators
would
have
had
us
leave
off
but
excited
as
we
were
it
was
impossible
we
stopped
not
for
their
exclamations
i
was
put
to
my
last
shifts
to
avoid
the
blows
of
the
rajpoot
he
had
better
wind
than
i
and
this
obliged
me
to
alter
my
mode
of
play
hitherto
i
had
attacked
him
i
now
only
warded
off
his
cuts
but
watched
my
opportunity
in
his
eagerness
thinking
by
a
succession
of
blows
he
could
beat
down
my
guard
he
exposed
his
side
and
my
stick
descended
on
his
ribs
with
a
sound
which
was
heard
by
all
and
with
a
force
which
fairly
took
away
his
breath
had
my
weapon
been
a
sword
i
think
i
should
have
cut
him
in
two
fairly
won
cried
cheetoo
fairly
and
bravely
won
ramdeen
singh
thou
hast
lost
but
it
is
no
disgrace
to
thee
come
to
me
and
i
will
reward
thee
the
rajpoot
laughed
and
i
was
glad
he
bore
the
defeat
so
for
i
had
expected
the
contrary
he
allowed
that
he
had
been
vanquished
and
cried
out
to
all
that
it
had
been
a
fair
encounter
and
that
he
had
used
the
utmost
of
his
skill
so
beware
he
continued
how
any
of
you
engage
the
meer
sahib
you
all
know
what
i
am
and
i
have
been
fairly
beaten
i
was
delighted
with
the
noble
fellow
and
addressed
cheetoo
himself
i
crave
a
boon
khodawund
and
if
i
may
hope
to
have
it
granted
i
will
speak
say
on
he
replied
i
will
grant
it
readily
then
said
i
let
this
brave
fellow
be
placed
under
me
by
your
favour
a
stranger
has
been
entrusted
with
the
command
of
part
of
the
harawul
and
i
would
have
both
these
rajpoots
with
me
and
be
allowed
to
entrust
fifty
men
to
the
one
and
to
the
other
good
said
cheetoo
let
it
be
so
and
do
you
ghuffoor
khan
look
to
it
that
it
is
done
these
are
the
men
who
will
serve
us
in
the
time
of
need
a
few
days
more
and
i
was
fairly
installed
into
my
new
charge
fortune
had
favoured
me
far
above
my
expectations
and
i
saw
nought
before
me
but
a
career
of
distinction
under
my
new
master
true
i
was
no
longer
a
leader
on
my
own
responsibility
but
the
rank
i
held
was
honourable
and
perhaps
far
above
my
deserts
i
seized
an
opportunity
which
presented
itself
and
wrote
a
full
account
of
the
whole
to
my
father
and
azima
for
i
knew
that
they
would
rejoice
at
tidings
so
new
and
unexpected
our
time
passed
in
the
camp
in
the
manner
i
have
related
in
the
mornings
i
was
a
constant
attendant
upon
cheetoo
who
rarely
allowed
me
to
leave
his
person
during
his
inspections
of
the
constantly
arriving
new
adventurers
and
the
evenings
closed
with
feats
of
strength
and
trials
of
skill
in
which
i
sustained
the
reputation
i
had
begun
with
i
never
spent
a
happier
time
than
the
month
i
was
at
nemawur
in
every
way
so
gratifying
to
me
and
so
consonant
to
my
previously
formed
wishes
at
last
the
festival
of
the
dussera
arrived
and
it
was
held
with
great
pomp
and
show
a
grand
review
of
all
the
assembled
adventurers
was
held
a
muster
taken
and
it
was
reported
that
five
thousand
good
horsemen
were
present
and
this
number
with
their
followers
and
those
indifferently
mounted
was
augmented
to
nearly
eight
thousand
a
gallant
band
ready
to
do
the
bidding
of
their
chief
and
to
carry
war
and
devastation
into
the
countries
before
them
it
was
planned
that
we
should
separate
into
two
bodies
soon
after
passing
the
nurbudda
penetrate
as
far
as
the
kistna
river
to
the
south
and
should
we
find
that
fordable
then
press
on
as
far
south
as
we
could
without
exposing
ourselves
to
encounters
with
the
regular
armies
of
the
feringhees
which
we
were
assured
although
at
present
inactive
could
speedily
be
sent
in
pursuit
of
us
accordingly
as
the
morning
broke
the
whole
camp
was
in
motion
and
a
noble
sight
it
was
to
see
durra
after
durra
defile
before
their
chief
and
hurry
onwards
at
a
rapid
pace
boats
had
been
provided
at
the
nurbudda
which
we
crossed
the
same
day
and
took
up
our
ground
near
the
town
of
hindia
on
its
southern
bank
at
this
point
the
army
separated
i
remained
with
my
division
and
cheetoo
and
we
pushed
on
the
day
after
taking
a
direction
to
the
westward
so
as
to
come
upon
the
river
taptee
up
the
valley
of
which
we
were
to
proceed
till
we
should
reach
the
territories
of
the
rajah
of
nagpoor
with
whom
a
treaty
had
been
previously
made
to
allow
us
a
free
and
unmolested
passage
through
his
dominions
on
the
condition
that
they
were
not
to
be
plundered
the
other
division
under
syud
bheekoo
a
leader
of
note
and
only
second
to
cheetoo
took
a
direction
to
the
eastward
along
the
bank
of
the
nurbudda
until
they
reached
the
grand
road
to
nagpoor
by
which
it
was
their
intention
to
travel
meanwhile
we
proceeded
by
rapid
marches
for
we
were
eager
to
reach
the
scene
of
our
operations
as
our
money
was
running
short
and
without
plunder
we
should
starve
we
heard
that
there
was
a
small
detachment
of
regular
troops
under
major
fraser
watching
our
movements
but
our
spies
told
us
they
were
few
in
number
and
we
were
under
no
apprehension
of
an
attack
from
them
it
was
reported
that
they
did
not
exceed
three
hundred
men
and
we
vainly
thought
they
would
not
dare
to
face
as
many
thousands
but
we
had
not
sufficiently
estimated
their
bravery
we
knew
they
were
upwards
of
fifteen
coss
distant
from
us
and
what
infantry
could
make
that
march
and
attack
a
body
of
horse
like
ours
they
did
however
attack
us
we
had
arrived
at
our
ground
near
a
village
on
the
taptee
and
some
were
cooking
their
morning
meal
others
lounging
idly
about
the
camp
or
lying
at
full
length
on
their
when
the
alarm
was
given
that
the
feringhees
were
upon
us
the
scene
of
confusion
which
ensued
is
indescribable
men
hurried
hither
and
thither
anything
like
organization
was
past
all
hope
each
as
he
could
gain
his
horse
threw
himself
upon
it
and
fled
for
his
life
not
a
man
stood
in
vain
i
entreated
those
with
me
to
rally
and
make
a
charge
on
the
small
body
of
which
was
now
drawn
up
in
line
close
to
our
camp
and
was
pouring
volley
after
volley
amongst
us
with
destructive
precision
not
a
man
would
hear
me
and
though
my
own
thugs
and
a
few
of
my
division
swore
they
would
die
if
i
were
to
lead
them
on
i
saw
no
chance
of
success
and
as
one
or
two
of
my
men
had
fallen
near
me
we
too
at
length
turned
our
horses
heads
and
fled
we
were
not
pursued
though
there
were
some
horsemen
with
the
infantry
who
had
they
not
been
the
most
arrant
cowards
would
have
charged
after
and
engaged
us
i
must
say
i
longed
that
they
should
and
i
kept
my
men
nearly
a
hundred
in
a
close
body
while
from
time
to
time
we
faced
about
and
shook
our
spears
in
defiance
at
the
body
of
horse
about
our
own
number
who
however
did
not
stir
we
saw
the
infantry
once
more
put
in
motion
to
take
possession
of
our
camp
which
with
the
thousands
of
temporary
screens
from
the
sun
standing
here
and
there
and
the
fires
burning
under
victuals
must
have
been
a
welcome
to
them
after
their
long
march
they
must
have
gained
a
considerable
booty
for
many
a
man
threw
himself
on
the
bare
back
of
his
horse
leaving
a
saddle
behind
him
to
the
victors
our
surprise
and
route
was
complete
and
if
the
enemy
had
had
a
larger
body
of
infantry
or
any
good
cavalry
with
them
to
have
followed
us
we
might
have
bid
adieu
to
all
hopes
of
future
plunder
and
most
likely
should
have
taken
our
way
to
our
respective
homes
and
abandoned
the
expedition
as
it
was
however
we
found
we
had
not
lost
more
than
a
hundred
men
and
three
days
afterwards
we
were
again
reunited
and
in
as
good
spirits
as
ever
at
length
we
debouched
by
almost
untrodden
paths
from
the
hills
to
the
eastward
of
ellichpoor
and
from
among
the
dense
jungles
i
had
before
traversed
after
the
affair
with
the
moghulanee
we
entered
the
territories
of
the
nizam
near
the
river
wurda
which
we
crossed
and
in
one
march
of
nearly
coss
reached
oomraotee
which
it
appeared
had
been
the
object
of
our
leader
from
the
first
i
have
once
before
described
its
riches
and
prosperity
and
it
was
then
far
richer
than
it
is
now
as
we
rushed
along
more
like
the
flood
of
a
mighty
river
than
aught
else
every
village
on
our
route
was
instantly
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
and
left
to
our
mercy
they
were
one
by
one
ransacked
for
treasure
and
in
some
of
the
largest
much
booty
was
obtained
i
was
fortunate
in
leading
the
on
this
day
and
well
do
i
remember
the
excitement
of
the
moment
as
we
passed
the
last
defile
in
the
hills
and
rushed
in
a
body
into
the
plain
well
do
i
remember
waving
my
sword
to
my
companions
whose
numbers
were
now
swelled
to
nearly
five
hundred
splendid
fellows
often
increased
by
parties
from
the
rear
as
i
showed
them
the
broad
plains
of
berar
and
told
them
that
we
had
unlimited
power
to
plunder
as
we
listed
ghuffoor
khan
envied
me
that
day
he
had
been
detained
with
cheetoo
who
remained
with
the
main
body
while
my
own
harawul
was
increased
in
order
that
i
might
advance
and
surround
oomraotee
on
we
dashed
the
few
villages
we
surprised
were
quickly
laid
under
contribution
and
rupees
and
gold
and
silver
ornaments
were
tendered
almost
without
our
asking
by
their
terrified
inhabitants
as
we
proceeded
the
news
that
we
were
coming
had
spread
through
every
village
and
thousands
of
the
people
were
seen
flying
from
their
homes
while
a
few
only
remained
in
each
with
an
offering
to
me
accompanied
by
entreaties
not
to
burn
their
villages
nor
did
i
though
from
the
pillars
of
smoke
which
not
long
afterwards
arose
in
every
direction
behind
us
i
too
justly
thought
the
main
body
had
been
less
merciful
than
we
had
we
reached
oomraotee
towards
evening
there
were
but
few
soldiers
to
guard
this
important
post
and
they
had
fled
on
the
news
of
our
approach
we
therefore
entered
the
town
unchecked
and
unopposed
how
different
was
my
present
from
my
former
visit
i
directed
my
course
to
the
main
street
where
i
knew
i
should
find
the
principal
sahoukars
and
after
stationing
parties
of
my
men
at
each
end
and
at
the
different
outlets
i
rode
into
the
middle
of
the
chouke
or
and
dismounted
among
the
leading
men
of
the
town
who
had
a
carpet
spread
and
were
prepared
as
they
said
to
do
us
honour
but
few
words
of
greeting
passed
for
ours
was
no
cordial
visit
and
each
party
was
bent
on
driving
the
hardest
bargain
come
gentlemen
said
i
after
i
had
listened
for
some
time
to
their
vain
protestations
of
poverty
and
inability
to
raise
a
sum
adequate
to
my
desires
this
is
mere
fooling
you
have
offered
a
lakh
of
rupees
do
you
think
the
noble
cheetoo
will
be
satisfied
with
this
i
swear
by
the
koran
he
will
not
and
you
had
better
at
once
be
reasonable
and
listen
to
my
words
the
whole
lubhur
will
be
here
before
it
is
dark
and
if
any
of
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
ascend
one
of
your
tall
houses
or
one
of
the
bastions
you
will
see
how
pindharees
mark
their
progress
many
a
fine
village
behind
me
has
not
now
a
roof
or
tree
standing
and
your
good
town
will
assuredly
share
the
same
fate
if
you
trifle
with
us
and
not
only
will
it
be
burned
but
your
property
will
be
handed
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
my
men
ay
and
your
wives
and
daughters
also
so
i
give
you
fair
warning
you
have
no
force
to
oppose
us
and
if
you
refuse
i
am
desired
to
tell
you
that
we
shall
stay
here
for
some
days
and
amuse
ourselves
by
inspecting
the
interior
of
your
houses
go
therefore
be
wise
consult
among
yourselves
and
before
the
shadow
of
this
tree
has
lengthened
the
measure
of
my
sword
and
i
laid
it
on
the
ground
bring
me
an
answer
worthy
of
your
name
for
wisdom
and
liberal
withal
beyond
that
time
i
give
you
not
a
moment
your
houses
are
close
at
hand
and
inshalla
we
will
help
ourselves
well
spoken
cried
all
the
men
who
were
around
me
but
meer
sahib
why
not
help
ourselves
at
once
these
stingy
merchants
can
have
no
idea
of
the
wants
of
men
of
honour
like
us
who
have
a
long
journey
before
us
you
shall
hear
what
they
say
replied
i
meanwhile
let
us
be
quiet
and
orderly
and
let
none
of
you
interrupt
their
consultations
or
offer
violence
to
any
of
the
townspeople
the
time
had
nearly
elapsed
and
the
hilt
of
my
sword
was
all
that
remained
in
the
sunlight
the
council
of
the
merchants
was
from
all
appearances
as
far
from
a
decision
as
ever
if
i
might
judge
from
their
angry
debate
and
the
unsettled
and
anxious
expressions
of
their
countenances
eagerly
i
watched
the
increasing
shadow
as
from
time
to
time
i
called
to
them
that
the
period
allowed
had
nearly
elapsed
at
last
the
bright
hilt
of
my
sword
glittered
no
longer
and
i
took
it
up
amidst
a
shout
from
my
men
the
merchants
saw
my
action
and
again
advanced
in
a
body
towards
me
sit
down
meer
sahib
said
the
fattest
of
them
who
appeared
to
be
the
chief
sit
down
let
us
talk
over
this
matter
calmly
and
deliberately
that
business
is
always
unsatisfactory
which
is
done
in
a
hurry
and
with
heated
minds
no
i
exclaimed
i
will
not
standing
as
i
am
i
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
remember
when
i
draw
my
sword
the
plunder
begins
and
though
i
have
some
influence
over
these
brave
fellows
while
they
expect
a
reasonable
offer
from
you
yet
the
instant
they
are
disappointed
my
power
ends
and
i
will
not
answer
for
any
of
your
lives
come
aside
with
me
for
a
moment
said
the
chief
merchant
i
would
speak
with
you
apart
you
need
fear
no
treachery
from
a
sahoukar
we
all
laughed
heartily
no
no
said
i
i
fear
nought
and
will
come
and
do
you
my
good
fellows
i
added
turning
to
my
men
see
that
none
of
these
worthy
persons
escape
well
said
i
when
we
had
gone
a
few
paces
from
the
group
what
would
you
say
be
quick
my
men
are
impatient
and
your
houses
and
shops
are
provokingly
and
temptingly
near
listen
then
replied
he
you
are
a
leader
and
by
your
conduct
doubtless
have
the
influence
you
appear
to
have
you
have
not
more
than
five
hundred
men
with
you
we
offer
you
therefore
ten
thousand
rupees
as
your
own
share
one
thousand
to
each
of
your
sirdars
and
one
hundred
apiece
to
your
men
this
will
be
nearly
a
lakh
of
rupees
and
we
will
take
our
chance
with
the
main
body
what
do
you
say
be
quick
and
tell
me
for
the
money
is
at
hand
and
can
be
easily
distributed
before
the
main
body
comes
up
i
pondered
awhile
i
knew
cheetoo
would
make
his
own
terms
and
i
did
not
see
any
harm
in
getting
as
much
as
i
could
of
the
spoil
before
he
came
i
knew
also
that
he
expected
ten
lakhs
and
would
get
it
or
nearly
the
sum
by
fair
means
or
foul
listen
again
said
the
sahoukar
you
are
in
advance
you
have
nought
to
do
but
take
your
money
and
push
on
and
any
village
before
you
will
shelter
you
for
the
night
what
will
cheetoo
know
of
it
nay
said
i
here
we
remain
after
a
march
of
coss
we
are
in
no
humour
to
proceed
but
i
will
take
my
men
outside
the
town
on
the
instant
payment
of
one
lakh
of
rupees
remember
one
third
of
what
we
get
goes
to
the
chief
and
our
share
after
all
is
not
much
agreed
said
he
now
come
to
your
men
and
persuade
them
to
be
quiet
they
will
not
get
so
much
by
violence
as
by
treating
us
well
we
returned
to
the
group
we
had
left
and
i
unfolded
to
them
the
proposition
which
had
been
made
to
me
it
was
welcomed
with
a
loud
shout
which
made
the
air
ring
and
was
then
succeeded
by
loud
cries
for
the
money
the
sum
had
evidently
been
collected
previously
for
in
a
few
moments
a
line
of
men
heavily
laden
with
bags
of
rupees
issued
from
a
lane
close
to
where
we
were
sitting
duffa
by
duffa
of
the
pindharees
each
headed
by
its
own
duffadar
was
brought
up
to
the
spot
each
man
received
his
hundred
rupees
each
leader
his
thousand
which
were
stowed
away
in
the
capacious
bags
of
their
saddles
you
have
not
cared
for
yourself
meer
sahib
said
peer
khan
you
have
taken
nothing
oh
do
not
fear
for
me
i
replied
i
have
got
my
share
the
bag
does
not
look
large
but
it
holds
gold
his
eyes
brightened
that
is
right
he
said
the
others
must
not
know
of
it
not
a
syllable
it
is
known
only
to
you
and
myself
now
we
must
take
care
these
rascals
commit
no
excesses
they
seem
half
in
the
humour
to
run
riot
in
the
town
they
seem
content
he
replied
at
least
i
for
one
am
by
alla
meer
sahib
this
is
rare
work
a
thousand
rupees
in
a
morning
ride
is
better
than
our
own
profession
though
we
have
been
lucky
in
our
time
choop
said
i
silence
this
is
no
time
for
our
secrets
away
with
you
see
that
the
men
take
up
ground
before
the
town
i
will
remain
here
with
some
others
and
see
what
becomes
of
the
place
when
cheetoo
arrives
one
by
one
the
pindharees
left
me
except
a
few
who
stayed
by
my
desire
and
our
business
at
an
end
i
sat
down
and
awaited
arrival
what
do
you
think
he
will
ask
said
my
fat
friend
to
me
i
know
not
i
answered
but
you
had
better
be
liberal
at
once
or
he
will
sack
your
town
and
you
know
what
pindharees
are
they
have
few
scruples
and
some
of
you
may
be
tortured
a
general
shudder
ran
through
the
assembly
at
the
thought
of
the
torture
and
i
saw
i
had
made
a
hit
yes
i
continued
there
are
such
things
as
korlas
and
your
fat
backs
would
soon
be
laid
open
besides
there
are
fellows
who
are
rare
hands
at
tying
up
fingers
and
hitting
them
on
the
ends
which
is
not
agreeable
i
should
think
also
at
mixing
compositions
for
those
bags
to
be
tied
over
your
mouths
i
have
heard
of
even
still
worse
contrivances
to
persuade
obstinate
sahoukars
but
ye
are
wise
men
ye
will
be
warned
say
at
once
meer
sahib
said
another
of
the
merchants
who
had
not
yet
spoken
say
what
we
should
offer
and
how
many
pindharees
are
there
we
have
heard
there
are
five
thousand
somewhat
below
the
mark
séthjee
said
i
we
are
little
under
ten
thousand
i
think
however
you
will
see
the
lubhur
and
judge
for
yourselves
as
for
the
sum
i
should
say
in
the
first
place
a
lakh
of
rupees
for
cheetoo
himself
i
know
he
expects
as
much
then
there
are
three
sirdars
heeroo
ghuffoor
khan
and
rajun
fifty
thousand
apiece
then
each
minor
leader
and
duffadar
a
thousand
and
every
good
pindharee
a
hundred
say
have
i
spoken
well
bhugwan
protect
us
cried
one
and
all
we
are
ruined
and
dead
men
why
this
would
be
at
least
eight
lakhs
of
rupees
where
are
we
to
get
such
a
sum
we
are
ruined
and
better
kill
us
at
once
no
no
my
good
friends
not
so
said
i
all
the
world
knows
that
oomraotee
is
the
richest
town
in
the
country
ay
richer
than
hyderabad
itself
and
that
the
money
maybe
counted
not
by
lakhs
but
by
crores
so
talk
not
to
cheetoo
of
your
poverty
for
he
will
presently
prove
whether
you
lie
or
not
trust
me
your
safest
plan
is
to
offer
him
a
large
sum
at
once
for
he
has
a
long
journey
before
him
the
men
have
got
nothing
since
we
left
nemawur
and
they
are
hungry
and
thirsty
i
tell
you
all
said
the
fat
sahoukar
the
worthy
meer
sahib
speaks
the
truth
bhugwan
has
sent
this
gurdee
calamity
and
we
must
be
resigned
to
our
fate
better
far
is
it
to
give
the
uttermost
farthing
than
to
see
our
wives
and
daughters
dishonoured
before
our
eyes
i
have
spoken
good
cried
i
now
you
speak
like
wise
men
and
i
will
give
you
further
advice
cheetoo
is
a
great
man
and
loves
to
be
paid
honour
as
indeed
is
due
to
him
so
also
do
the
other
leaders
now
get
your
pan
uttur
and
spices
make
up
a
proper
tray
of
them
bring
a
few
handsome
shawls
and
as
he
takes
his
seat
one
of
you
throw
a
pair
of
the
best
over
his
shoulders
and
those
of
the
other
chiefs
and
lay
your
nuzzurs
before
him
as
you
would
before
sikundur
jah
himself
inshalla
you
will
find
favour
in
his
sight
and
where
you
would
have
to
pay
ten
lakhs
you
will
get
off
with
half
the
sum
and
save
your
town
besides
by
gunga
is
well
said
cried
several
meer
sahib
you
are
a
kind
friend
and
give
good
advice
without
you
we
should
not
have
known
what
to
do
again
said
i
let
none
of
you
have
long
faces
but
all
look
as
if
you
were
rejoiced
at
his
coming
be
none
of
you
alarmed
before
you
have
cause
pay
you
must
and
therefore
do
it
with
as
good
a
grace
as
you
can
the
assembly
drank
in
my
words
as
i
by
turns
advised
and
alarmed
them
in
order
to
keep
up
the
spirit
i
had
infused
and
in
this
manner
the
time
passed
until
the
dusk
of
evening
when
by
the
noise
of
the
tread
of
many
horses
feet
and
the
firing
of
matchlocks
we
were
assured
of
the
approach
of
the
main
body
now
stick
by
us
cried
the
sahoukars
as
they
crowded
round
me
you
are
our
friend
and
must
present
us
we
will
not
be
afraid
but
their
words
belied
them
for
the
teeth
of
one
and
all
were
chattering
with
fear
and
their
cheeks
blanched
at
the
thoughts
of
confronting
the
pindharee
chief
cheetoo
came
and
riding
into
the
chouke
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
figures
the
effect
of
whose
appearance
was
materially
increased
by
the
dusk
of
the
evening
his
titles
were
screamed
out
by
a
dozen
mouths
each
vying
with
the
other
in
exaggeration
of
his
powers
the
group
of
sahoukars
headed
by
me
advanced
towards
him
and
the
head
merchant
rubbing
his
forehead
on
the
chief
stirrup
implored
him
to
alight
and
refresh
himself
adding
that
a
zeafut
had
been
prepared
and
all
were
desirous
of
presenting
their
nuzzurs
i
seconded
the
request
and
he
exclaimed
surely
i
know
that
voice
whose
in
the
name
of
shitan
is
it
that
of
your
slave
ameer
ali
said
i
oh
then
all
is
right
he
cried
and
thou
too
hast
turned
sahoukar
how
is
this
meer
sahib
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
nuwab
said
i
i
have
but
mingled
with
these
worthy
persons
because
they
declared
they
should
be
annihilated
at
the
sight
of
the
splendour
of
your
appearance
i
did
but
console
them
and
keep
up
their
spirits
till
my
lord
arrived
thou
hast
done
well
said
cheetoo
is
everything
prepared
all
cried
the
sahoukars
if
the
noble
cheetoo
will
but
alight
we
are
prepared
to
do
him
honour
he
alighted
and
led
by
the
hand
by
the
chief
merchant
he
was
conducted
into
an
adjoining
house
which
belonged
to
one
of
the
merchants
and
where
a
clean
white
had
been
spread
and
a
musnud
placed
the
room
too
was
well
lighted
cheetoo
took
his
seat
and
looked
around
him
with
evident
gratification
savage
as
his
countenance
was
it
now
wore
a
smile
of
triumph
yet
mixed
with
an
expression
of
extreme
pleasure
these
are
civilised
people
said
he
to
rajun
his
favourite
who
was
close
to
him
i
little
expected
this
did
you
indeed
no
said
he
i
thought
we
should
have
had
to
cut
our
way
into
the
town
depend
on
it
this
is
some
of
ameer
ali
doing
likely
enough
said
cheetoo
he
is
a
gentleman
and
knows
how
a
gentleman
ought
to
be
received
but
for
him
it
is
most
probable
these
swine
would
have
shut
themselves
up
in
their
houses
and
given
us
the
trouble
of
pulling
them
out
but
see
what
are
they
about
i
was
nudged
by
the
sahoukar
who
whispering
implored
me
to
ask
cheetoo
to
accept
their
nuzzur
five
hundred
rupees
for
you
if
he
takes
it
again
he
whispered
as
i
pretended
to
hesitate
agreed
said
i
i
will
revenge
myself
if
it
is
not
paid
by
gunga
by
my
junwa
again
said
he
most
earnestly
nay
i
will
double
it
speak
for
us
good
meer
sahib
are
you
not
our
friend
and
our
brother
what
are
those
sons
of
asses
talking
to
you
about
cried
cheetoo
why
do
they
speak
out
khodawund
i
said
the
terror
of
your
name
has
preceded
you
and
he
smiled
grimly
and
your
appearance
is
in
every
way
so
imposing
and
surpassing
the
accounts
these
men
have
heard
that
by
alla
they
are
dumb
and
though
they
would
fain
lay
a
nuzzur
at
your
feet
in
every
way
befitting
your
high
rank
they
have
not
words
to
express
their
desires
and
have
begged
your
slave
to
inform
my
lord
of
them
kabool
kabool
i
agree
cried
cheetoo
let
the
trays
be
brought
verily
a
nuzzur
from
the
sahoukars
of
oomraotee
ought
to
be
worth
seeing
fifteen
trays
were
brought
in
covered
with
rich
velvet
coverings
and
set
down
before
the
musnud
one
by
one
their
covers
were
removed
and
indeed
it
was
a
goodly
sight
dates
pistachio
nuts
sweetmeats
and
filled
four
the
rest
contained
cloths
of
various
kinds
european
and
indian
muslins
chintzes
rich
turbans
and
benares
brocades
it
was
a
nuzzur
fit
for
a
prince
and
cheetoo
was
delighted
now
said
i
to
the
sahoukar
this
is
a
happy
moment
where
are
the
shawls
and
the
ashruffees
have
a
stout
heart
and
throw
the
shawls
over
him
as
you
would
over
one
of
your
own
tribe
at
a
marriage
the
sahoukar
took
the
shawls
from
an
attendant
and
putting
five
ashruffees
upon
them
advanced
to
the
feet
of
cheetoo
and
having
made
the
tusleemât
or
three
obeisances
he
presented
the
gold
and
unfolding
the
shawls
which
were
very
splendid
dexterously
enveloped
the
person
in
them
and
then
retreating
stood
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
breast
in
an
attitude
of
respectful
humility
chapter
xxxiv
cheetoo
was
evidently
flattered
by
the
distinction
with
which
he
had
been
received
and
as
he
examined
the
beautiful
shawls
which
now
enveloped
his
person
a
grim
smile
of
delight
lighted
up
his
coarse
features
these
men
have
sense
said
he
to
ghuffoor
khan
and
are
evidently
accustomed
to
the
visits
of
persons
of
quality
we
little
expected
this
civility
and
in
truth
it
is
most
acceptable
after
our
long
ride
but
they
have
forgotten
you
not
so
noble
cheetoo
cried
the
sahoukar
advancing
with
several
pairs
of
shawls
over
his
arm
we
are
not
forgetful
of
our
distinguished
guests
and
he
threw
a
pair
over
each
of
the
chiefs
which
they
received
with
complacency
let
the
room
be
cleared
cried
cheetoo
we
have
business
with
these
worthy
gentlemen
which
i
have
sworn
to
do
before
we
touch
any
refreshment
it
was
quickly
done
and
there
only
remained
our
leaders
and
the
sahoukars
who
huddled
together
like
wild
fowl
on
the
approach
of
a
hawk
come
forward
said
cheetoo
to
them
come
and
sit
near
us
we
would
speak
to
you
they
all
arose
and
as
they
were
directed
seated
themselves
in
respectful
attitudes
on
the
edge
of
the
musnud
now
continued
cheetoo
you
are
doubtless
aware
of
our
object
we
want
money
and
money
we
will
have
by
fair
means
or
foul
if
ye
are
wise
ye
will
pay
me
handsomely
to
be
rid
of
me
and
my
people
who
are
savage
fellows
i
desire
not
to
harm
you
and
on
your
own
heads
be
it
if
any
disaster
befalls
you
say
therefore
how
much
are
ye
prepared
to
give
truly
said
the
sahoukar
my
friend
who
was
the
spokesman
we
have
been
duly
advised
of
your
highness
coming
and
as
a
proof
that
we
did
not
dread
you
you
see
us
here
and
we
have
done
our
poor
ability
to
welcome
so
distinguished
a
person
we
have
also
received
good
counsel
from
your
servant
the
meer
sahib
and
agreeably
to
his
instructions
we
have
drawn
up
a
list
of
a
few
trifles
and
some
ready
money
which
we
are
desirous
of
laying
at
the
feet
of
your
highness
and
the
sahoukar
handed
to
him
a
paper
written
in
persian
this
is
unintelligible
to
me
for
i
am
no
moonshee
but
can
any
of
you
read
brothers
asked
cheetoo
of
the
other
leaders
not
a
word
not
a
letter
cried
one
and
all
none
of
us
know
one
letter
from
another
i
can
send
for
a
moonshee
said
the
sahoukar
one
is
in
attendance
if
i
am
permitted
said
i
i
will
read
the
list
i
may
be
able
to
make
it
out
ha
thou
art
a
clerk
as
well
as
a
good
soldier
cried
cheetoo
laughing
well
take
the
paper
and
let
us
hear
our
good
fortune
first
then
said
i
after
i
had
glanced
over
the
document
this
paper
sets
forth
that
the
sahoukars
and
others
of
the
of
oomraotee
in
council
assembled
having
heard
of
the
near
approach
of
the
mighty
cheetoo
and
his
army
and
being
desirous
of
approaching
his
feet
with
a
small
tribute
of
respect
have
put
down
the
following
articles
and
sums
of
ready
money
which
are
prepared
and
ready
for
his
acceptance
on
no
condition
save
that
they
may
find
favour
in
his
sight
and
be
the
humble
means
of
insuring
his
clemency
to
others
good
said
cheetoo
now
get
thee
to
the
marrow
of
the
matter
as
speedily
as
may
be
for
my
stomach
craves
food
and
i
doubt
not
these
worthy
gentleman
families
have
prepared
a
repast
for
me
it
is
ready
noble
cheetoo
cried
the
sahoukar
and
if
the
order
is
given
it
will
be
set
out
but
the
food
of
us
poor
hindoos
would
be
tasteless
to
my
lord
and
therefore
we
have
had
the
repast
cooked
by
the
best
bawurchees
of
the
town
silence
cried
the
chief
speak
when
you
are
allowed
to
do
so
we
are
in
no
humour
to
be
interrupted
the
sahoukar
shrank
back
intimidated
and
raising
my
voice
i
proceeded
the
first
item
protector
of
the
poor
cried
i
is
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
rupees
for
yourself
is
that
all
cried
he
his
brow
contracting
stay
said
i
more
follows
tray
of
choice
jewels
gold
and
silver
valued
at
fifteen
thousand
rupees
and
three
trays
of
shawls
and
brocades
for
my
lord
muhal
valued
at
ten
thousand
rupees
in
all
thousand
rupees
secondly
a
sum
of
ten
thousand
rupees
to
each
leader
of
rank
of
whom
we
learn
from
the
worthy
syud
ameer
ali
there
are
three
a
tray
of
jewels
to
each
of
five
thousand
rupees
and
three
trays
each
valued
at
five
thousand
more
in
all
twenty
thousand
rupees
each
go
on
cried
cheetoo
you
have
not
done
yet
i
suppose
no
said
i
glancing
down
the
paper
there
is
more
following
a
sum
of
one
thousand
rupees
to
each
duffadar
we
are
uninformed
of
their
number
but
we
have
supposed
thirty
good
cried
cheetoo
what
more
the
sum
of
fifty
rupees
to
each
deserving
person
to
be
given
at
the
discretion
of
the
mighty
cheetoo
by
report
we
hear
there
are
four
thousand
also
food
grain
and
forage
for
as
many
days
as
the
army
may
remain
with
us
this
is
all
said
i
what
are
my
orders
the
list
is
well
enough
said
cheetoo
but
they
are
wrong
in
some
particulars
first
there
are
fifty
duffadars
are
there
not
ghuffoor
khan
there
are
he
replied
i
told
them
off
myself
put
that
down
meer
sahib
said
cheetoo
again
there
are
five
thousand
good
pindharees
am
i
not
right
true
again
cried
all
the
leaders
were
they
not
counted
at
nemawur
this
was
a
lie
there
were
hardly
four
thousand
for
nearly
half
the
lubhur
had
gone
off
in
a
different
direction
from
the
nurbudda
but
it
signified
little
for
cheetoo
i
knew
was
determined
to
make
the
best
terms
he
could
with
the
sahoukars
put
down
five
thousand
said
cheetoo
and
now
see
how
much
you
have
got
i
hastily
arranged
the
amount
and
read
the
paper
to
him
first
said
i
there
is
your
highness
share
thousand
rupees
secondly
on
account
of
the
leaders
sixty
thousand
rupees
then
the
fifty
duffadars
each
man
a
thousand
fifty
thousand
rupees
lastly
five
thousand
men
each
forty
two
hundred
thousand
and
the
sum
of
the
whole
is
three
lakhs
and
thousand
rupees
and
said
cheetoo
to
ghuffoor
khan
the
horses
shoes
must
be
worn
out
i
think
we
require
new
ones
certainly
cried
the
khan
with
a
merry
grin
put
down
fifteen
thousand
rupees
for
the
this
meer
sahib
will
make
the
sum
an
even
four
lakhs
and
gentlemen
continued
he
to
the
sahoukars
i
must
trouble
you
to
pay
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
or
we
must
help
ourselves
there
was
a
hurried
conference
for
a
few
moments
among
the
sahoukars
and
a
few
angry
words
passed
among
them
but
they
were
wise
my
fat
friend
rose
and
making
a
lowly
obeisance
declared
the
money
was
at
hand
and
should
be
brought
immediately
good
cried
cheetoo
now
let
me
have
my
dinner
and
do
you
all
see
that
the
duffadars
are
present
at
this
house
by
dawn
to
receive
their
shares
and
those
of
their
men
the
lubhur
must
move
on
for
after
this
kind
reception
i
would
not
have
my
friends
the
sahoukars
exposed
to
the
chance
of
being
plundered
by
my
lawless
bands
the
chiefs
separated
and
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
room
with
them
when
chetoo
called
me
back
come
and
take
your
dinner
with
me
said
he
i
doubt
not
your
friends
the
sahoukars
have
prepared
enough
for
us
two
i
obeyed
the
order
and
seated
myself
at
the
edge
of
the
musnud
the
dinner
was
soon
brought
and
a
choice
repast
it
was
we
did
justice
to
it
for
in
truth
our
travel
had
sharpened
our
appetites
these
satisfied
and
inhaling
the
fragrant
smoke
of
our
pipes
cheetoo
asked
me
how
i
had
managed
to
bring
about
so
advantageous
a
reception
as
he
had
met
with
i
related
the
whole
to
him
suppressing
however
the
fact
that
i
had
secured
for
myself
so
large
a
sum
as
ten
thousand
rupees
for
had
i
disclosed
that
he
would
presently
have
helped
himself
to
half
of
it
at
least
peer
khan
was
the
only
person
who
knew
of
it
and
to
him
alone
was
i
determined
to
entrust
it
he
was
delighted
he
had
i
knew
determined
to
raise
a
large
sum
and
i
had
purposely
exaggerated
his
probable
demand
to
the
sahoukars
this
and
my
threats
and
hints
of
the
place
being
given
up
to
plunder
on
the
least
demur
on
their
parts
of
paying
handsomely
had
been
successful
you
see
meer
sahib
said
he
by
your
excellent
conduct
i
have
secured
first
thousand
rupees
and
what
is
over
after
every
proper
pindharee
has
got
his
forty
rupees
will
make
the
sum
pretty
near
a
lakh
which
is
you
will
say
a
good
beginning
may
your
prosperity
increase
noble
cheetoo
said
i
if
your
slave
can
help
you
to
a
few
more
sums
like
the
present
he
will
only
feel
himself
too
happy
and
too
honoured
by
distinction
like
the
present
for
the
men
i
had
with
me
i
made
the
same
terms
as
you
have
accepted
for
the
whole
and
they
were
well
satisfied
and
for
yourself
meer
sahib
i
have
not
got
much
said
i
perhaps
i
might
have
arrogated
to
myself
the
distinction
of
one
of
the
leaders
but
i
refrained
they
gave
me
five
thousand
rupees
however
and
i
am
satisfied
nay
said
cheetoo
it
was
too
little
my
friend
and
i
advise
you
to
get
as
much
as
you
can
next
time
and
as
you
have
behaved
so
well
in
this
instance
at
the
head
of
the
i
will
give
it
into
your
command
in
future
and
must
satisfy
ghuffoor
khan
as
well
as
i
can
he
is
a
good
soldier
but
a
fellow
who
is
always
for
helping
himself
and
setting
fire
to
towns
and
villages
by
which
we
seldom
get
half
as
much
especially
from
these
rich
places
as
we
could
do
by
a
little
management
and
a
few
soft
words
may
your
condescension
increase
nuwab
cried
i
your
servant
inshalla
will
never
disappoint
you
i
took
leave
of
him
soon
afterwards
and
joined
the
sahoukars
who
were
sitting
below
counting
the
money
which
lay
in
large
heaps
on
the
floor
they
received
me
joyfully
and
expressed
in
forcible
language
how
much
they
were
indebted
to
me
for
my
active
interference
in
their
behalf
they
would
have
pressed
on
me
the
five
hundred
rupees
they
had
promised
when
i
presented
them
to
cheetoo
but
i
refused
it
no
said
i
if
i
have
done
you
service
and
i
think
i
have
i
will
not
sell
my
good
offices
you
have
dealt
as
well
by
me
as
i
have
by
you
so
the
balance
is
even
all
i
pray
of
you
is
to
let
me
have
my
money
in
gold
bars
which
i
can
easily
conceal
except
a
few
hundred
rupees
for
present
expenses
it
is
granted
said
the
sahoukar
and
i
had
shortly
afterwards
the
gold
in
my
possession
and
taking
a
few
of
the
sahoukars
men
to
guard
me
i
bent
my
way
to
the
camp
the
bright
fires
of
which
sparkled
through
the
darkness
on
the
plain
beyond
the
town
revealing
many
a
wild
group
which
huddled
round
them
to
warm
themselves
from
the
effects
of
the
almost
chilling
night
breeze
i
was
soon
at
my
little
tent
which
consisted
of
a
cloth
stretched
over
three
spears
two
of
which
were
stuck
into
the
ground
and
another
tied
across
them
as
a
ridge
pole
and
assisted
by
peer
khan
i
put
the
gold
into
the
bags
i
had
made
in
the
flaps
of
my
saddle
and
sewed
them
over
i
was
ten
thousand
rupees
richer
in
one
night
this
is
grand
work
said
peer
khan
here
we
have
had
no
trouble
and
if
we
go
on
at
this
rate
we
shall
return
far
richer
than
after
the
toil
and
risk
of
a
hundred
thuggee
expeditions
i
am
to
have
the
always
said
i
and
it
shall
be
my
own
fault
if
we
do
not
always
secure
a
good
share
for
my
own
part
i
have
foresworn
thuggee
as
long
as
there
is
a
pindharee
chief
to
erect
his
standard
and
we
will
all
follow
you
he
replied
motee
and
the
others
are
delighted
with
their
success
and
are
in
high
spirits
there
is
not
one
of
them
but
has
got
a
good
share
of
work
for
we
stuck
near
you
and
were
bribed
well
to
use
our
influence
with
you
they
thought
us
all
duffadars
and
you
know
motee
and
myself
shared
as
such
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
said
i
if
you
are
not
all
duffadars
in
reality
before
long
let
the
men
make
themselves
active
and
dress
handsomely
you
are
all
well
mounted
and
will
catch
the
eye
of
the
chief
by
dawn
the
next
morning
i
was
with
cheetoo
the
sahoukars
had
collected
the
whole
of
the
money
by
subscriptions
among
themselves
and
collections
from
the
town
and
the
whole
was
distributed
fairly
i
must
say
among
the
pindharees
each
duffadar
bore
away
the
share
of
his
duffa
and
they
knew
too
well
the
risk
they
would
run
if
they
defrauded
any
man
of
his
just
due
a
few
hours
elapsed
and
after
a
hurried
meal
every
man
was
on
his
horse
and
the
lubhur
departed
to
seek
fresh
plunder
in
the
country
before
them
yet
before
he
set
out
cheetoo
promised
in
consequence
of
the
ready
payment
of
the
sum
he
received
that
in
every
future
expedition
he
might
undertake
the
town
of
oomraotee
should
be
exempted
from
contributions
and
he
kept
his
word
oomraotee
was
never
again
plundered
and
a
large
body
of
troops
which
were
stationed
there
afterwards
effectually
deterred
small
and
straggling
parties
from
surprising
it
as
we
had
done
onwards
we
dashed
i
at
the
head
of
my
band
who
had
now
implicit
confidence
in
me
caracoled
along
on
my
gallant
horse
with
a
heart
as
light
and
happy
as
the
unlimited
freedom
of
action
i
possessed
could
make
it
no
thought
of
care
intruded
and
i
was
spared
the
pain
of
seeing
the
villages
we
passed
through
from
each
of
which
we
levied
at
much
as
we
could
which
was
instantly
laden
on
the
shootur
camels
that
accompanied
us
burned
or
plundered
and
the
inoffensive
inhabitants
subjected
to
the
cruel
tortures
of
the
men
in
the
rear
who
were
often
disappointed
of
booty
we
halted
at
karinjah
a
few
soldiers
who
were
in
the
town
made
a
feeble
defence
and
wounded
a
few
of
my
men
as
we
rushed
into
the
place
but
they
were
soon
killed
or
dispersed
and
as
a
warning
to
other
villages
it
was
given
up
to
sack
and
ruin
i
could
never
bear
the
sight
of
wanton
cruelty
and
i
repaired
to
my
place
in
the
camp
shortly
afterwards
i
could
see
from
the
bright
blaze
which
rose
from
different
parts
of
the
village
almost
simultaneously
against
the
clear
gray
evening
sky
that
it
was
doomed
to
destruction
rapidly
the
fire
spread
while
the
shouts
of
the
pindharees
engaged
in
their
horrid
work
and
the
screams
of
the
inhabitants
those
of
the
women
were
fearfully
shrill
and
distinct
made
a
fit
accompaniment
but
it
was
a
work
in
which
the
pindharees
delighted
order
which
never
existed
save
when
there
was
no
excitement
was
completely
at
an
end
and
any
attempt
to
have
checked
the
mad
riot
which
was
going
on
would
have
been
attended
most
likely
with
death
to
the
interferer
my
own
thugs
too
sat
around
me
for
a
thug
is
not
savage
and
they
had
no
inclination
to
join
in
the
excesses
we
sat
in
silence
but
our
attention
was
soon
arrested
by
the
figure
of
a
man
dragging
along
a
girl
who
resisted
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
but
who
was
evidently
nearly
exhausted
i
rushed
forward
to
her
rescue
and
my
eyes
fell
on
the
person
of
ghuffoor
khan
his
savage
features
exaggerated
in
their
ferocious
expression
by
lust
and
the
scene
he
had
been
engaged
in
ha
cried
he
meer
sahib
is
that
you
here
have
i
been
working
like
a
true
pindharee
and
have
brought
off
something
worth
having
look
at
her
man
is
she
not
a
peri
a
hoori
the
fool
her
mother
must
needs
oppose
me
when
i
got
into
their
house
but
i
silenced
her
with
a
thrust
of
my
sword
and
lo
here
is
her
fair
daughter
a
worthy
mate
for
a
prince
speak
my
pretty
one
art
not
thou
honoured
at
the
prospect
of
the
embraces
of
ghuffoor
khan
by
alla
sahib
i
could
have
killed
him
and
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
have
done
so
as
he
stood
unprepared
i
had
half
drawn
my
sword
from
its
scabbard
but
i
returned
it
i
made
an
inward
determination
as
to
his
fate
and
i
kept
it
i
vainly
endeavoured
to
induce
him
to
give
up
the
girl
and
let
her
go
but
he
laughed
in
my
face
and
dragged
her
off
she
would
fain
have
fled
from
him
and
attempted
to
do
so
but
he
pursued
and
caught
her
for
her
tender
feet
were
cut
by
the
rough
ground
and
i
lost
sight
of
them
both
in
the
quickly
closing
darkness
miserable
girl
she
was
a
brahmin
daughter
and
was
spared
the
degradation
of
seeing
the
light
of
another
day
and
the
misery
of
returning
to
her
desolate
home
polluted
and
an
outcast
ghuffoor
khan
told
me
in
the
morning
with
a
hellish
laugh
that
he
had
murdered
her
as
she
tried
to
possess
herself
of
his
dagger
to
plunge
it
into
her
own
heart
i
spared
her
the
trouble
he
said
gradually
the
fire
lessened
in
its
fury
as
there
remained
but
few
houses
unconsumed
but
the
pindharees
were
still
at
their
wild
and
horrible
work
as
the
shrieks
borne
to
us
on
the
night
wind
too
well
testified
i
had
heard
that
these
excesses
were
sometimes
committed
but
i
had
formed
no
idea
of
the
terrible
reality
a
thousand
times
i
formed
the
resolution
to
quit
the
lubhur
and
return
to
my
home
but
again
the
thought
that
a
few
straggling
horsemen
who
could
give
no
proper
account
of
themselves
would
be
immediately
taken
for
pindharees
and
sacrificed
by
the
now
infuriated
people
of
the
country
this
and
i
must
add
a
restless
desire
for
further
adventures
caused
me
to
dismiss
it
from
my
mind
it
began
to
rain
too
and
we
all
huddled
together
in
my
little
tent
and
passed
a
weary
night
till
the
morning
broke
then
we
were
again
in
motion
and
the
town
of
karinjah
now
a
heap
of
smouldering
ruins
was
soon
far
behind
us
we
passed
mungrool
and
beyond
the
town
now
in
the
broad
daylight
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
spot
where
my
first
victim
had
fallen
i
had
thought
that
the
place
where
he
fell
was
in
a
large
and
dense
jungle
so
at
least
it
appeared
that
night
in
the
moonlight
but
it
was
not
so
the
rivulet
was
the
same
as
when
we
had
passed
it
and
i
stood
once
more
on
the
very
spot
where
the
sahoukar
had
fallen
a
thin
belt
of
bushes
fringed
the
stream
and
peer
khan
pointed
with
a
significant
gesture
a
little
higher
up
than
the
place
at
which
we
crossed
it
was
the
where
they
were
buried
and
it
now
seemed
a
fearfully
insecure
spot
for
the
concealment
of
our
victims
so
close
to
the
road
and
apparently
so
thinly
screened
from
observation
yet
many
years
had
now
passed
since
they
were
deposited
in
their
last
and
a
succession
of
rainy
seasons
had
either
washed
away
their
remains
or
covered
them
still
deeper
with
sand
we
passed
the
spot
too
where
our
bands
had
encamped
and
separated
and
before
me
was
now
a
new
country
though
it
little
differed
in
character
from
that
we
had
already
traversed
we
halted
at
basim
and
i
greatly
feared
a
repetition
of
the
scenes
of
the
past
night
but
the
men
were
to
my
astonishment
quiet
and
orderly
and
a
handsome
contribution
levied
in
the
town
in
all
probability
saved
it
from
hence
in
five
marches
we
reached
nandair
on
the
godavery
a
rich
town
and
one
which
promised
as
large
a
supply
to
our
army
as
we
had
got
at
oomraotee
we
had
feared
the
news
of
our
approach
would
have
reached
it
and
that
the
sahoukars
and
wealthy
inhabitants
would
have
fled
but
it
was
not
so
they
were
completely
surprised
and
at
our
mercy
for
not
a
single
soldier
worth
mentioning
was
there
to
guard
the
place
a
few
there
certainly
were
who
shut
themselves
up
in
an
old
fort
which
overhangs
the
river
and
commands
the
ford
but
they
kept
within
the
walls
only
firing
a
or
two
whenever
any
of
our
marauders
approached
too
near
we
did
not
molest
them
but
set
ourselves
to
work
to
levy
as
large
a
sum
as
possible
as
before
the
advance
guard
had
been
entrusted
to
me
and
i
pursued
the
same
system
i
had
done
at
oomraotee
i
will
not
weary
you
with
a
repetition
of
almost
the
same
tale
suffice
it
to
say
that
one
lakh
and
a
half
of
rupees
were
collected
and
paid
to
the
army
and
i
got
for
my
own
share
nearly
three
thousand
rupees
some
jewels
and
a
pair
of
shawls
the
town
was
not
destroyed
indeed
that
would
have
been
impossible
as
the
houses
were
substantial
ones
with
terraced
roofs
but
the
suburbs
suffered
and
the
huts
of
the
unfortunate
weavers
were
sacked
for
the
fine
cloths
for
which
the
place
is
famous
nor
in
vain
for
half
the
army
the
next
day
appeared
in
new
turbans
and
waistbands
the
river
was
not
fordable
and
there
was
but
one
boat
we
therefore
pushed
along
the
northern
bank
till
we
reached
gunga
khair
where
we
were
told
there
were
boats
and
a
more
convenient
ferry
nor
were
we
disappointed
we
crossed
with
ease
during
the
day
on
which
we
arrived
opposite
the
place
the
men
swimming
their
horses
across
and
the
plunder
and
baggage
being
brought
over
by
the
boats
a
few
hundred
men
attempted
to
defend
the
town
but
it
was
carried
by
forcing
open
the
gate
and
plundered
we
lost
some
of
our
men
and
i
was
grazed
on
the
leg
by
a
bullet
and
disabled
from
taking
any
active
part
in
the
sack
of
the
place
peer
khan
and
motee
were
however
not
idle
and
brought
a
goodly
heap
of
jewels
and
coin
to
swell
the
general
stock
from
hence
we
penetrated
southward
beeder
bhalkee
the
fine
and
flourishing
town
of
hoomnabad
a
second
oomraotee
were
severally
plundered
or
laid
under
heavy
contributions
while
every
village
which
lay
in
our
route
was
sacked
and
too
often
burned
and
destroyed
from
hoomnabad
i
led
three
hundred
men
to
kullianee
a
few
coss
distant
but
we
found
the
alarm
had
been
given
and
that
all
the
rich
inhabitants
had
taken
refuge
in
the
fort
which
is
a
very
strong
one
and
to
us
was
impregnable
such
was
the
dread
we
inspired
however
that
the
defenders
of
it
remained
quietly
within
it
and
allowed
us
to
keep
quiet
possession
of
the
town
till
the
next
morning
when
we
again
rejoined
the
main
body
we
descended
by
a
pass
in
the
hills
to
the
village
of
chincholee
which
was
of
course
plundered
and
we
followed
a
direct
southwardly
route
burning
and
plundering
every
place
in
our
way
till
the
broad
and
deep
stream
of
the
krishna
effectually
opposed
our
further
progress
here
the
lubhur
halted
for
some
days
forage
was
plentiful
every
one
was
loaded
with
money
and
we
enjoyed
ourselves
in
our
encampment
as
true
pindharees
were
seized
from
all
parts
of
the
surrounding
country
though
no
violence
was
ever
offered
to
them
and
they
amused
us
with
their
songs
and
performances
and
left
us
when
we
were
again
put
in
motion
well
satisfied
and
well
rewarded
and
regretting
that
they
could
not
accompany
us
cheetoo
was
wrong
to
have
halted
for
the
alarm
that
pindharees
were
out
had
flown
through
the
country
and
in
our
march
towards
koolburgah
we
got
no
plunder
worth
mentioning
koolburgah
we
found
garrisoned
and
prepared
for
our
reception
so
relinquishing
our
designs
upon
sholapoor
and
the
rich
towns
of
barsee
and
wyrag
we
struck
off
in
the
direction
of
bheer
pyetun
and
aurungabad
hoping
to
surprise
the
latter
though
we
feared
it
would
be
well
garrisoned
but
i
was
determined
to
surprise
barsee
and
wyrag
if
i
could
and
i
laid
my
proposals
for
the
expedition
before
cheetoo
he
readily
acceded
to
my
request
at
which
ghuffoor
khan
was
extremely
savage
and
taking
with
me
three
hundred
men
the
best
i
could
select
and
dividing
them
into
duffas
under
my
own
thugs
i
left
the
main
body
at
the
town
of
allund
and
dashed
on
towards
toljapoor
from
whence
there
is
a
pass
into
the
low
country
toljapoor
has
little
to
recommend
it
but
the
temple
of
bhowanee
which
is
a
place
of
pilgrimage
and
though
i
knew
there
were
hoards
of
jewels
in
the
possession
of
the
brahmins
yet
as
many
of
my
men
were
hindoos
they
would
not
hear
of
the
temples
being
sacked
and
i
was
forced
to
content
myself
with
levying
a
few
thousand
rupees
from
the
inhabitants
wyrag
was
our
next
aim
and
we
were
successful
our
force
was
supposed
to
be
a
risala
of
mahratta
horse
who
were
known
to
be
in
the
district
and
we
were
allowed
to
enter
the
town
unopposed
we
sacked
it
and
got
a
large
booty
for
there
was
no
time
for
a
proposal
of
contribution
indeed
i
thought
not
of
that
alternative
nor
could
i
restrain
my
men
after
their
long
march
yet
they
were
not
cruel
nor
did
i
hear
of
any
of
them
having
tortured
any
one
and
the
inhabitants
gave
up
enough
of
their
valuables
to
satisfy
them
easily
here
we
heard
that
the
risala
we
had
been
mistaken
for
was
at
barsee
and
as
that
place
lay
in
our
direct
road
to
bheer
where
we
were
to
join
the
main
body
i
was
obliged
to
give
up
my
intention
of
proceeding
through
it
there
was
also
a
large
body
of
the
nizam
horse
at
puréndah
and
i
feared
that
we
might
be
cut
off
an
instant
return
by
the
road
we
had
come
was
our
only
alternative
and
after
a
few
hours
rest
we
were
again
in
our
saddles
and
travelling
as
fast
as
we
could
urge
our
horses
towards
toljapoor
nobly
did
my
gallant
horse
carry
me
that
day
most
of
the
men
dosed
theirs
with
opium
to
insure
their
bottom
but
my
good
charger
needed
it
not
and
he
was
almost
as
fresh
when
we
again
reached
toljapoor
as
when
he
had
left
it
here
we
rested
a
day
to
refresh
ourselves
and
after
that
pushing
on
we
overtook
the
main
body
at
bheer
where
they
were
encamped
i
had
been
baffled
in
part
of
my
design
yet
cheetoo
received
with
great
complacency
ten
thousand
rupees
in
money
and
nearly
the
same
amount
in
jewels
which
i
presented
to
him
in
full
durbar
as
the
results
of
my
enterprise
for
this
he
invested
me
with
a
dress
of
honour
and
presented
me
with
a
good
horse
from
among
his
own
chapter
xxxv
bheer
was
sacked
and
given
up
to
rapine
and
excess
for
two
whole
days
and
when
we
left
it
scarcely
a
rag
remained
to
the
miserable
inhabitants
it
was
piteous
to
see
them
raking
together
a
few
posts
of
wood
many
of
them
half
burned
and
erecting
wretched
hovels
which
they
covered
with
green
boughs
to
screen
themselves
from
the
cold
winds
of
the
night
they
suffered
the
ravage
of
their
town
passively
for
there
were
no
soldiers
to
protect
it
and
what
could
they
have
done
against
a
and
savage
horde
like
ours
pyetun
on
the
godavery
shared
the
same
fate
and
though
many
of
the
rich
inhabitants
had
fled
for
refuge
to
aurungabad
yet
enough
remained
for
our
purpose
you
know
perhaps
that
this
place
is
celebrated
for
a
manufacture
of
brocaded
muslins
only
inferior
to
those
of
benares
and
at
that
time
there
was
an
active
demand
for
them
to
supply
the
courts
of
poona
and
hyderabad
you
may
judge
therefore
of
the
value
of
the
plunder
we
got
cheetoo
camels
and
elephants
were
laden
to
the
utmost
none
of
us
fared
badly
and
our
own
stock
was
now
so
large
of
one
valuable
or
another
that
i
hardly
thought
we
should
have
been
enabled
to
carry
it
with
us
i
need
not
follow
our
track
much
further
with
minuteness
suffice
it
therefore
to
say
that
we
passed
the
adjuntah
ghat
not
however
without
being
closely
pressed
by
some
troops
of
the
feringhees
but
we
eluded
them
by
a
rapid
march
or
two
and
after
a
vain
attempt
on
boorhanpoor
we
struck
off
to
the
right
by
the
valley
of
the
taptee
and
in
a
few
days
were
safely
returned
to
the
camp
at
nemawur
in
a
little
more
than
three
months
we
had
traversed
the
richest
part
of
the
broad
territory
of
the
nizam
we
had
eluded
his
troops
and
those
of
the
feringhees
and
laughed
at
their
beards
we
had
plundered
his
richest
towns
with
impunity
and
we
had
returned
with
scarcely
the
loss
of
a
man
laden
with
plunder
of
enormous
value
so
rich
was
it
that
the
sahoukars
of
nemawur
after
purchasing
all
they
could
from
us
were
unable
to
find
further
funds
to
buy
up
the
whole
and
merchants
from
oojein
and
indoor
and
all
the
neighbouring
large
cities
were
sent
for
to
our
rich
market
in
due
time
all
had
been
purchased
and
every
man
prepared
to
return
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
his
home
with
the
proceeds
of
his
booty
i
need
not
say
how
my
heart
bounded
at
the
prospect
of
again
seeing
mine
and
laying
at
my
azima
feet
the
wealth
i
had
acquired
nor
the
pleasure
she
would
experience
in
hearing
me
recount
the
wild
adventures
i
had
gone
through
i
accordingly
purchased
all
the
gold
i
could
as
also
did
my
men
and
hiring
two
swift
camels
i
loaded
them
with
it
and
the
valuable
cloths
we
had
received
for
our
own
use
and
was
ready
for
a
rapid
march
to
jhalone
when
i
could
receive
my
dismissal
from
durbar
this
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
attain
for
i
had
served
the
chief
faithfully
he
had
confidence
in
my
address
and
activity
and
was
loath
to
part
with
me
fearing
i
would
not
return
to
his
standard
the
day
i
went
to
take
leave
he
would
not
receive
my
parting
gift
nor
give
me
the
usual
ceremonial
return
of
uttur
and
pan
on
my
departure
and
i
sat
in
the
durbar
in
gloomy
thought
that
perhaps
treachery
was
intended
towards
me
a
poor
return
for
my
exertions
but
i
was
wrong
he
called
me
towards
him
when
but
few
remained
and
appointing
a
late
hour
in
the
night
for
an
interview
and
private
conversation
desired
me
to
be
punctual
for
that
he
had
matters
of
importance
to
reveal
to
me
i
returned
to
my
abode
in
better
hope
yet
still
suspecting
and
almost
inclined
to
follow
the
advice
of
peer
khan
and
the
rest
who
would
fain
have
had
me
fly
as
the
only
means
of
preserving
our
money
i
did
not
however
entirely
mistrust
cheetoo
but
i
determined
if
he
put
me
off
with
further
words
and
caused
me
more
delay
that
i
would
at
once
leave
him
in
the
best
way
i
could
i
accordingly
attended
at
the
hour
appointed
which
was
past
midnight
i
found
the
chief
alone
i
had
never
before
been
so
honoured
as
to
be
admitted
to
an
entirely
private
conference
though
i
had
been
allowed
a
seat
in
his
councils
and
my
suggestions
had
been
followed
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
could
not
divine
what
was
to
ensue
be
seated
syud
said
cheetoo
i
have
much
to
say
to
thee
speak
on
nuwab
i
replied
your
words
are
sweet
to
your
servant
and
they
will
fall
on
ears
which
will
convey
their
meaning
to
a
heart
devoted
to
your
service
listen
then
said
he
but
first
i
will
ask
you
what
you
thought
the
object
of
the
last
expedition
to
be
its
object
cried
i
why
i
suppose
only
to
get
as
much
money
as
you
could
for
yourself
and
your
men
so
as
to
be
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
war
which
sooner
or
later
must
ensue
between
the
mahrattas
and
the
feringhees
may
their
race
be
accursed
i
never
could
divine
a
deeper
object
though
i
have
thought
upon
the
subject
myself
and
heard
many
opinions
expressed
by
others
you
are
partly
right
said
he
but
not
entirely
now
you
shall
hear
the
whole
and
what
my
further
projects
are
i
settled
myself
into
an
attitude
of
profound
attention
and
drank
in
his
words
as
he
proceeded
you
have
had
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
times
meer
sahib
and
i
expected
it
from
you
you
may
have
heard
that
tippoo
sultan
on
whose
memory
be
peace
would
fain
have
enlisted
the
nizam
and
the
whole
of
the
mahrattas
in
one
confederacy
to
overthrow
and
extirpate
the
feringhees
had
his
plans
been
successful
he
would
have
done
it
but
a
curse
on
his
avarice
he
had
an
to
divide
the
territories
with
the
mahrattas
which
was
discovered
alla
only
knows
how
and
a
curse
on
the
luck
of
the
feringhees
who
overthrew
the
only
power
which
while
it
lasted
upheld
the
dignity
of
the
faith
tippoo
is
gone
and
his
power
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
at
this
moment
though
holkar
is
sorely
disabled
from
what
he
was
and
sindia
has
made
a
base
league
of
passiveness
with
the
feringhees
a
deep
confederacy
exists
among
the
mahratta
states
and
particularly
between
those
of
poona
and
nagpoor
to
rise
simultaneously
and
declare
war
against
the
usurping
and
europeans
sikundur
jah
will
join
with
the
feringhees
not
that
he
can
do
much
for
his
army
is
miserable
and
his
leaders
have
neither
skill
nor
bravery
but
still
he
will
befriend
them
to
the
utmost
and
his
dominions
are
open
to
the
passage
and
subsistence
of
their
troops
and
in
them
positions
can
be
taken
up
which
will
sorely
harass
the
future
operations
of
the
mahratta
leaders
my
last
expedition
was
therefore
intended
and
by
the
favour
of
alla
it
has
succeeded
to
impoverish
sikundur
jah
country
to
keep
the
people
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
and
need
i
add
to
till
our
own
purses
now
listen
again
to
effect
my
purpose
thoroughly
and
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
europeans
from
the
preparations
of
the
mahrattas
these
expeditions
must
be
rapid
in
succession
to
have
their
due
effect
one
half
of
the
huzoor
dominions
have
been
sacked
and
the
other
half
remains
inshalla
it
shall
share
the
same
fate
the
feringhees
will
be
kept
in
a
perpetual
state
of
alarm
they
will
follow
us
vainly
from
place
to
place
but
i
fear
them
not
i
have
laughed
at
their
beards
once
and
will
do
so
again
they
shall
know
who
cheetoo
pindharee
is
and
to
their
cost
not
only
shall
the
cowardly
nizam
suffer
but
the
rich
provinces
of
the
feringhees
shall
be
wasted
i
will
cross
the
krishna
the
river
will
be
fordable
or
nearly
so
and
the
whole
of
the
provinces
which
are
not
overrun
by
their
troops
shall
be
prostrated
before
my
power
this
will
exhaust
their
resources
and
paralyze
their
efforts
the
mahrattas
will
then
rise
to
a
man
i
will
join
them
for
i
have
been
promised
a
high
command
in
their
armies
and
territories
after
their
conquest
and
we
will
rise
meer
sahib
yes
i
say
for
these
stirring
times
are
the
fit
ones
for
such
as
myself
and
you
inshalla
we
will
take
advantage
of
them
and
win
fame
for
ourselves
which
posterity
shall
wonder
at
it
is
a
rare
plan
said
i
and
a
deep
one
while
the
game
seems
easy
to
play
i
can
find
no
fault
with
it
but
will
not
the
feringhees
be
prepared
for
us
and
meet
us
wherever
we
show
our
faces
no
cried
he
vehemently
they
will
not
cunning
as
they
are
i
will
be
before
them
in
the
field
they
now
think
that
glutted
with
plunder
we
shall
remain
quietly
here
and
be
fools
enough
to
wait
for
another
dussera
before
we
are
again
on
the
move
but
they
are
wrong
to
a
man
and
here
has
lain
the
cause
of
my
apparent
secrecy
with
you
i
could
not
proclaim
it
in
my
durbar
that
i
had
planned
another
expedition
some
prating
fool
would
have
blabbed
of
it
at
his
home
and
the
news
would
have
flown
over
the
country
in
a
week
no
i
have
kept
it
secret
except
from
a
few
and
they
are
my
chief
leaders
every
one
of
whom
has
a
thousand
men
at
his
back
hear
me
i
am
determined
by
the
favour
of
alla
to
move
hence
at
the
head
of
a
larger
army
than
the
last
has
been
in
a
space
of
time
under
two
months
say
will
you
come
i
will
give
you
the
command
of
a
thousand
horse
for
i
love
you
and
depend
upon
you
can
you
return
from
jhalone
in
that
time
i
have
no
wish
to
detain
you
here
a
man
home
is
dear
to
him
wherever
it
is
and
you
are
right
to
return
to
it
yet
tell
me
that
you
will
join
me
within
two
months
and
what
i
have
promised
i
will
perform
i
will
cried
i
may
your
condescension
increase
your
slave
will
take
advantage
of
your
bounty
in
less
than
two
months
though
i
travel
night
and
day
i
will
come
and
bring
more
men
with
me
the
more
the
better
said
cheetoo
take
the
best
horse
from
my
stable
if
you
wish
it
he
can
not
be
in
better
hands
than
your
own
and
as
you
will
want
camels
take
too
as
many
as
you
require
from
my
own
fleet
ones
load
them
lightly
and
they
will
keep
up
with
you
and
now
go
i
am
weary
in
mind
and
body
and
need
repose
you
i
doubt
not
will
start
with
the
morning
dawn
go
and
may
peace
be
with
you
i
left
him
and
joyfully
rejoined
my
associates
i
knew
the
secret
was
safe
with
them
and
as
i
unfolded
the
deep
plan
to
them
they
were
lost
in
wonder
and
admiration
at
cheetoo
sagacity
and
forethought
to
a
man
they
swore
to
join
me
and
to
follow
my
fortunes
through
good
or
merrily
we
set
off
the
next
morning
and
quickly
miles
and
miles
of
road
disappeared
under
the
hoofs
of
our
fleet
and
hardy
steeds
in
far
less
time
than
it
had
taken
us
to
come
we
had
reached
jhalone
unlooked
for
and
unexpected
and
with
a
joyful
bound
i
crossed
my
own
threshold
and
was
again
clasped
in
the
embrace
of
my
azima
what
words
can
paint
our
joy
i
can
not
describe
it
my
heart
was
too
full
for
utterance
as
i
was
again
seated
in
my
own
zenana
and
beheld
the
frolics
and
gambols
of
my
beauteous
child
my
father
too
he
rejoiced
with
me
but
there
was
an
eye
of
evil
upon
us
our
cup
of
joy
was
fated
to
be
no
sooner
filled
to
the
brim
than
to
be
dashed
from
our
lips
that
eye
was
the
rajah
but
more
of
that
hereafter
not
that
i
neglected
him
the
prices
of
his
horses
were
duly
paid
and
i
presented
to
him
a
valuable
string
of
pearls
with
some
beautiful
cloths
the
plunder
of
pyetun
and
a
tray
of
gold
pieces
one
would
have
thought
he
would
have
been
satisfied
but
it
was
not
so
yet
he
was
all
smiles
and
congratulations
i
was
invested
with
a
dress
of
honour
and
encouraged
privately
for
he
secretly
knew
of
the
new
enterprise
to
further
exertions
and
cheered
on
by
him
to
win
distinction
and
renown
base
liar
and
murderer
he
deceived
me
but
who
could
have
guessed
his
thoughts
as
soon
as
i
could
i
dispatched
peer
khan
and
motee
with
two
of
the
others
in
various
directions
to
offer
terms
of
employment
and
the
prospect
of
booty
to
as
many
thugs
as
they
knew
to
be
good
men
and
good
horsemen
the
latter
was
a
qualification
in
which
but
few
thugs
excelled
nevertheless
in
the
space
of
ten
days
they
returned
with
twelve
others
some
of
whom
i
knew
and
all
were
stated
to
be
resolute
men
well
acquainted
with
the
use
of
their
weapons
they
were
easily
provided
with
horses
from
the
rajah
stables
as
the
first
had
been
for
he
had
received
more
than
double
their
value
and
would
now
have
risked
his
whole
stud
on
the
same
terms
i
examined
their
arms
and
rejected
such
as
were
defective
supplying
them
with
others
our
saddles
were
newly
stuffed
and
every
preparation
which
our
experience
could
suggest
was
made
for
even
a
longer
and
more
arduous
enterprise
than
that
from
which
we
had
just
returned
but
little
time
now
remained
to
me
to
enjoy
the
quiet
peacefulness
of
my
home
and
now
that
i
was
there
i
would
fain
have
never
again
left
it
wealth
i
had
in
abundance
enough
for
many
years
and
i
was
in
a
situation
from
which
i
could
have
risen
to
a
high
civil
employment
in
the
management
of
revenue
in
the
rajah
country
still
the
desire
for
adventure
was
not
blunted
and
above
all
the
promise
i
had
given
to
cheetoo
could
not
be
evaded
or
neglected
and
had
he
not
promised
me
the
command
of
a
thousand
men
this
had
many
charms
in
my
sight
and
should
his
plans
succeed
to
what
rank
might
i
not
rise
by
my
exertions
when
the
mahrattas
overthrew
the
europeans
and
the
nizam
and
their
broad
dominions
were
portioned
out
to
the
government
of
their
faithful
leaders
these
thoughts
urged
me
to
a
speedy
departure
and
tearing
myself
from
my
wife
i
left
the
town
with
the
blessings
of
my
father
and
the
apparent
goodwill
of
the
rajah
who
wished
me
every
success
and
presented
me
with
a
valuable
sword
as
a
mark
of
his
especial
favour
i
was
soon
again
with
cheetoo
who
received
me
with
great
joy
i
found
him
busied
with
the
large
preparations
he
was
making
for
his
intended
expedition
by
this
time
the
news
of
the
immense
booty
he
had
collected
in
his
first
expedition
had
spread
through
all
lands
far
and
near
thousands
had
flocked
to
nemawur
to
offer
themselves
to
his
service
in
the
hope
that
they
might
partake
in
the
next
and
hundreds
were
arriving
daily
to
swell
the
numbers
of
the
already
assembled
multitude
a
difficult
task
it
was
to
allot
the
various
tribes
and
individuals
to
the
command
of
the
different
leaders
and
my
aid
was
asked
by
cheetoo
and
as
readily
given
to
organize
as
far
as
we
could
the
heterogeneous
mass
it
was
no
easy
task
for
the
men
would
have
preferred
acting
independently
and
on
their
own
account
but
this
did
not
suit
cheetoo
intentions
as
his
irruption
though
for
the
sole
purpose
of
ravage
and
plunder
was
to
be
of
a
more
regular
kind
than
the
preceding
ghuffoor
khan
was
there
in
all
his
savageness
looking
forward
to
the
burning
of
towns
and
the
torture
of
inoffensive
persons
with
a
desire
which
had
received
additional
zest
from
his
previous
experience
we
were
on
civil
terms
but
i
had
never
forgotten
that
night
at
karinjah
and
the
memory
of
the
wretched
hindoo
girl
and
her
sufferings
and
murder
in
this
expedition
i
felt
assured
that
he
would
give
no
check
to
his
passions
and
i
only
waited
a
favourable
opportunity
to
arrest
his
career
of
crime
by
a
stroke
of
retributive
justice
until
this
arrived
i
was
determined
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
as
closely
as
possible
in
order
that
he
might
be
the
more
surely
my
own
our
preparations
were
now
made
upwards
of
ten
thousand
good
horse
were
already
enrolled
and
the
number
of
their
followers
was
beyond
computation
how
they
existed
on
their
own
resources
i
know
not
but
they
did
so
and
right
merrily
too
for
our
camp
was
one
scene
of
revelry
and
enjoyment
as
a
final
ceremony
cheetoo
held
a
general
durbar
at
which
all
the
chiefs
and
leaders
were
present
he
disclosed
his
plan
of
operations
which
was
to
penetrate
through
the
territories
of
the
rajah
of
nagpoor
to
the
and
passing
through
the
forests
and
jungles
of
gondwana
to
pour
his
forces
on
the
almost
unprotected
provinces
north
of
masulipatam
from
thence
to
cross
the
krishna
to
ravage
the
country
as
far
as
kurnool
and
to
return
from
thence
in
the
best
way
we
could
to
nemawur
this
plan
of
operations
was
received
with
glad
shouts
by
the
assembly
the
army
outside
the
tent
took
them
up
and
the
air
was
rent
with
cries
of
exultation
it
was
a
moment
all
partook
of
the
joy
and
the
chiefs
eagerly
besought
cheetoo
to
lose
no
time
in
his
departure
nor
did
he
prepared
as
the
whole
were
to
move
at
a
moment
warning
the
order
was
given
that
the
army
should
cross
the
nurbudda
the
next
day
chapter
xxxvi
at
the
head
of
the
advance
which
consisted
of
my
thousand
splendid
horsemen
i
was
the
first
to
cross
the
river
now
fordable
and
we
encamped
on
its
further
bank
in
the
same
spot
we
had
occupied
scarcely
five
months
before
almost
doubled
in
numbers
and
with
the
prospect
of
a
brilliant
foray
before
us
i
shall
not
speak
of
how
we
traversed
the
rajah
of
nagpoor
territories
or
penetrated
through
jungles
and
forests
which
till
now
had
hardly
ever
been
traversed
by
armies
we
suffered
often
sad
straits
for
the
want
of
water
but
all
bore
up
nobly
and
at
last
our
horde
rushed
upon
the
fertile
plains
of
the
northern
circars
and
everything
fell
before
it
mercy
was
shown
to
none
our
army
spread
itself
over
a
tract
of
country
many
miles
in
breadth
and
every
village
in
its
route
was
sacked
and
reduced
to
ashes
on
we
rushed
at
the
rate
of
ten
and
fifteen
coss
daily
neither
mountains
nor
rivers
impeded
us
in
the
language
of
hyperbole
we
devoured
the
former
and
drank
up
the
latter
troops
there
were
none
to
oppose
us
and
if
there
had
been
any
they
would
have
been
trampled
under
the
feet
of
our
victorious
squadrons
yet
we
had
no
disposition
to
fight
it
was
no
part
of
our
plan
if
we
heard
of
resistance
likely
to
be
offered
we
diverged
from
the
spot
for
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
exposing
ourselves
to
encounters
in
which
though
sure
of
victory
we
should
have
lost
many
of
our
men
and
crippled
our
future
operations
after
some
days
we
reached
guntoor
where
we
knew
there
was
a
large
treasure
collected
the
revenue
of
the
province
we
had
desolated
to
gain
this
was
an
object
on
which
cheetoo
had
set
his
heart
as
he
had
heard
it
amounted
to
many
lakhs
of
rupees
and
it
belonged
to
the
detested
europeans
my
men
rushed
with
yells
more
like
those
of
demons
than
men
upon
the
devoted
town
to
restrain
them
would
have
been
vain
and
i
did
not
attempt
it
it
was
thoroughly
sacked
in
the
presence
of
the
british
officers
who
confined
themselves
to
a
building
in
which
was
the
treasure
and
i
must
say
they
defended
their
charge
nobly
no
pindharee
could
show
himself
near
the
spot
without
being
a
target
for
a
volley
of
musquetry
and
though
i
importuned
cheetoo
to
allow
me
to
storm
the
building
at
the
head
of
my
risala
he
would
not
hear
of
it
he
had
been
deceived
he
said
about
there
being
troops
to
defend
it
and
though
i
always
thought
there
were
but
few
yet
he
exaggerated
their
numbers
and
relinquished
his
determination
in
revenge
however
for
our
disappointment
we
plundered
the
houses
of
the
officers
broke
all
their
furniture
and
set
fire
to
many
of
them
afterwards
in
the
hope
that
this
would
draw
them
from
their
post
and
expose
them
to
the
charge
of
the
horse
they
were
too
wise
however
to
venture
forth
and
reluctantly
we
left
the
place
from
which
we
had
promised
ourselves
so
large
a
booty
not
however
that
what
we
did
get
was
inconsiderable
though
many
were
disappointed
i
was
not
so
i
had
with
my
own
thugs
seized
upon
a
house
which
we
defended
against
the
pindharees
who
attempted
to
enter
and
we
despoiled
its
inmates
a
large
family
of
rich
hindoos
of
all
their
wealth
and
ornaments
to
the
amount
of
nearly
thirty
thousand
rupees
we
did
it
too
without
torture
for
i
never
permitted
it
though
we
were
obliged
to
use
threats
in
abundance
laden
with
our
spoil
we
left
the
town
in
the
afternoon
and
by
night
the
straggling
army
was
again
encamped
at
a
distance
of
nearly
ten
coss
from
it
secure
against
any
pursuit
we
crossed
the
krishna
and
penetrated
nearly
as
far
as
kurpah
where
he
heard
there
was
more
treasure
belonging
to
the
english
government
but
we
were
disappointed
in
this
also
the
officers
who
guarded
it
were
on
the
alert
and
the
station
was
guarded
by
troops
we
therefore
avoided
any
collision
with
them
and
directed
our
course
towards
kurnool
here
also
we
were
beaten
off
but
we
crossed
the
river
and
again
entered
the
nizam
territory
closely
pursued
by
a
body
of
english
cavalry
who
however
did
not
cross
after
us
a
consultation
was
now
held
and
it
was
determined
that
our
lubhur
should
separate
into
three
bodies
both
for
the
sake
of
destroying
and
ravaging
a
larger
tract
of
country
than
we
could
do
united
and
of
more
easily
evading
the
troops
which
now
watched
our
movements
in
every
direction
one
body
therefore
took
a
western
course
along
the
banks
of
the
river
another
an
eastern
one
and
a
third
a
middle
course
that
which
took
the
eastern
road
was
the
one
with
which
cheetoo
remained
and
with
it
were
ghuffoor
khan
and
myself
we
were
to
pass
through
the
country
to
the
eastward
of
hyderabad
and
regain
the
nagpoor
territories
by
the
great
north
road
through
nirmul
i
was
now
the
sole
companion
of
ghuffoor
khan
so
long
as
the
other
leaders
remained
he
was
mostly
in
their
company
but
now
their
absence
drew
us
together
and
i
may
almost
say
that
we
lived
in
the
same
tent
if
tent
it
could
be
called
which
served
to
shelter
us
from
the
excessive
heat
of
the
weather
need
i
mention
that
i
was
a
constant
witness
to
his
cruelties
they
were
of
occurrence
and
to
show
you
the
nature
i
shall
relate
one
as
a
specimen
of
thousands
of
a
similar
kind
that
he
committed
we
reached
a
town
the
name
of
which
i
forget
nor
does
it
signify
now
as
usual
it
was
entered
by
the
horde
and
the
work
of
destruction
commenced
why
should
i
conceal
it
i
was
as
busy
as
the
rest
and
not
a
house
or
hut
of
any
description
escaped
my
followers
and
myself
ghuffoor
khan
was
busy
too
i
had
completed
my
work
i
had
torn
ornaments
from
the
females
terrified
their
husbands
and
fathers
into
giving
up
their
small
hoards
of
money
and
having
got
all
i
could
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
town
in
company
with
my
thugs
who
never
separated
from
me
we
were
passing
through
the
main
street
on
our
return
when
our
attention
was
attracted
to
a
house
from
which
issued
the
most
piercing
screams
of
terror
and
agony
i
instantly
dismounted
and
bidding
my
men
follow
me
we
rushed
into
the
house
never
shall
i
forget
the
scene
which
met
my
eyes
when
we
reached
the
place
from
whence
the
screams
proceeded
there
was
ghuffoor
khan
with
seven
or
eight
of
his
men
engaged
in
a
horrid
work
three
dead
bodies
lay
on
the
floor
weltering
in
their
blood
which
poured
from
the
still
warm
corpses
two
were
fine
young
men
the
other
an
elderly
woman
before
ghuffoor
khan
stood
a
venerable
man
suffering
under
the
torture
of
having
a
horse
full
of
hot
ashes
tied
over
his
mouth
while
one
of
the
khan
followers
struck
him
incessantly
on
the
back
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
the
miserable
wretch
was
half
choked
and
it
was
beyond
his
power
to
have
uttered
a
word
in
reply
to
the
interrogations
which
were
thundered
in
his
ear
by
the
khan
himself
as
to
where
his
treasure
was
concealed
three
young
women
of
great
beauty
were
engaged
in
a
fruitless
scuffle
with
the
others
of
ghuffoor
khan
party
and
their
disordered
appearance
and
shrieks
too
well
told
what
had
been
their
fate
previous
to
my
entrance
what
could
i
do
i
dared
not
openly
have
attacked
the
khan
though
i
half
drew
my
sword
from
its
scabbard
and
would
have
rushed
on
him
but
he
was
my
superior
and
had
i
then
put
him
and
his
men
to
death
it
could
not
have
been
concealed
from
cheetoo
and
what
would
have
been
my
fate
so
checking
the
momentary
impulse
which
i
had
so
nearly
followed
i
approached
him
and
endeavoured
to
withdraw
his
attention
from
the
horrible
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
come
khan
sahib
i
cried
near
us
is
a
house
which
has
resisted
my
utmost
efforts
to
enter
i
want
you
to
aid
me
and
inshalla
it
will
repay
the
trouble
for
i
have
heard
that
it
is
full
of
money
and
jewels
as
the
family
is
rich
i
did
not
tell
a
lie
for
i
had
endeavoured
to
break
open
the
gate
of
a
large
house
but
desisted
when
i
was
informed
that
it
was
uninhabited
wait
awhile
said
he
i
have
had
rare
sport
here
these
fools
must
needs
oppose
our
entrance
with
drawn
weapons
and
i
got
a
scratch
on
the
arm
from
one
of
them
myself
but
what
could
they
do
the
kafirs
against
a
true
believer
they
fell
in
this
room
and
their
old
mother
too
by
my
own
sword
my
men
have
been
amusing
themselves
with
their
wives
whilst
i
you
see
am
trying
to
get
what
i
can
out
of
this
obstinate
old
villain
but
he
will
not
listen
to
reason
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
make
him
taste
hot
ashes
perhaps
he
has
naught
to
give
said
i
at
any
rate
he
can
not
speak
while
that
bag
is
over
his
mouth
let
it
be
removed
and
we
will
hear
what
he
has
to
say
try
it
said
the
khan
but
we
shall
make
nothing
of
him
you
will
see
remove
the
bag
cried
i
to
the
pindharee
who
was
behind
him
let
him
speak
and
bring
some
water
his
throat
is
full
of
ashes
the
bag
was
removed
and
a
vessel
full
of
water
which
was
in
a
corner
of
the
room
was
brought
and
put
to
his
lips
but
he
rejected
it
with
loathing
for
he
was
a
hindoo
and
a
brahmin
drink
cried
the
infuriated
khan
at
beholding
his
gesture
drink
or
by
alla
i
will
force
it
down
thy
throat
kafir
to
whom
the
urine
of
a
cow
is
a
delicacy
darest
thou
refuse
water
from
the
hands
of
a
moslem
devil
said
the
old
man
in
a
husky
voice
water
from
thy
hands
or
any
of
thy
accursed
race
would
poison
me
i
would
rather
drink
my
own
son
blood
which
is
flowing
yonder
than
such
pollution
ha
sayest
thou
so
then
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
prophet
thou
shalt
taste
it
here
sumund
khan
get
some
up
from
the
floor
yonder
is
a
cup
fill
it
to
the
brim
the
old
man
shall
drink
it
as
he
would
the
wine
of
paradise
hold
cried
i
to
ghuffoor
khan
you
would
not
do
so
inhuman
an
act
nay
interfere
not
said
the
khan
setting
his
teeth
you
and
i
meer
sahib
are
friends
let
us
remain
so
but
we
shall
quarrel
if
i
am
hindered
in
my
purpose
and
has
he
not
said
he
preferred
it
to
pure
water
sumund
khan
had
collected
the
blood
and
the
cup
was
half
filled
with
the
warm
red
liquid
a
horrible
draught
which
he
now
presented
to
the
miserable
father
drink
said
he
offering
the
cup
with
a
mock
polite
gesture
think
it
ganges
water
and
it
will
open
thy
heart
to
tell
us
where
thy
treasures
are
ghuffoor
khan
laughed
loudly
by
alla
thou
hast
a
rare
wit
sumund
khan
the
idea
should
be
written
in
a
book
i
will
tell
cheetoo
of
it
but
the
old
man
turned
from
them
with
loathing
and
his
chest
heaved
as
though
he
were
about
to
be
sick
there
no
use
wasting
time
cried
ghuffoor
khan
open
his
mouth
with
your
dagger
and
pour
the
draught
into
it
it
was
done
by
alla
sahib
the
two
did
it
before
my
eyes
fiends
that
they
were
not
only
did
they
pour
the
blood
down
the
old
man
throat
but
in
forcing
open
his
mouth
they
cut
his
lips
in
a
ghastly
manner
and
his
cheek
was
laid
open
now
tell
us
where
the
gold
is
cried
ghuffoor
khan
of
what
use
is
this
obstinacy
knowest
thou
not
that
thy
life
is
in
my
power
and
that
one
blow
of
my
sword
will
send
thee
to
jehanum
where
those
fools
are
gone
before
thee
and
he
pointed
to
the
dead
strike
cried
the
sufferer
strike
your
blow
will
be
welcome
i
am
old
and
fit
for
death
why
do
ye
delay
but
the
gold
the
treasures
roared
the
khan
stamping
on
the
ground
why
are
you
a
fool
gold
i
have
told
ye
i
have
none
he
replied
i
told
you
so
at
first
but
ye
would
not
listen
we
gave
you
all
we
had
and
ye
were
not
satisfied
ye
have
murdered
my
sons
and
my
wife
and
dishonoured
my
daughters
kill
us
all
and
we
will
be
thankful
hear
him
cried
the
khan
savagely
he
mocks
us
oh
the
wilful
wickedness
of
age
is
it
not
proverbial
one
of
you
bring
some
oil
and
a
light
we
will
see
whether
this
humour
can
stand
my
final
test
which
has
never
yet
failed
by
this
time
the
house
was
full
of
pindharees
and
if
i
had
wished
it
i
had
not
dared
to
interfere
further
i
stood
looking
on
determined
to
let
him
have
his
course
he
was
only
hastening
his
own
fate
and
why
should
i
prevent
it
the
oil
was
brought
and
a
quantity
of
rags
were
torn
from
the
dhotees
or
of
the
murdered
men
they
were
dipped
in
the
oil
and
wound
round
the
fingers
of
the
old
man
to
as
great
a
thickness
as
was
possible
now
bring
a
light
cried
the
khan
and
hold
him
fast
a
light
was
kindled
and
the
man
held
it
in
his
hand
i
give
you
a
last
chance
said
the
khan
speaking
from
between
his
closed
teeth
you
know
i
dare
say
the
use
your
fingers
will
be
put
to
be
quick
and
answer
or
i
will
make
torches
of
them
and
they
shall
light
me
to
your
treasures
which
i
warrant
are
hidden
in
some
dark
hole
do
your
worst
answered
the
old
man
in
a
desperate
tone
ye
will
not
kill
me
and
if
my
sufferings
will
in
any
way
gratify
you
even
let
it
be
so
for
narayun
has
given
me
into
your
power
and
it
is
his
will
and
not
yours
which
does
this
you
will
not
hear
me
cry
out
though
my
arms
were
burnt
off
to
the
sockets
i
spit
at
you
light
the
rags
roared
ghuffoor
khan
this
is
not
to
be
endured
they
were
lit
one
by
one
they
blazed
up
while
his
hands
were
forcibly
held
down
to
his
sides
to
accelerate
the
effect
of
the
fire
alla
alla
it
was
a
sickening
sight
the
warm
flesh
of
the
fingers
hissed
under
the
blaze
of
the
oiled
rags
which
were
fed
from
time
to
time
with
fresh
oil
as
men
pour
it
upon
a
torch
the
old
man
had
overrated
his
strength
what
nerves
could
bear
such
exquisite
torture
his
shrieks
were
piteous
and
would
have
melted
a
heart
of
stone
but
ghuffoor
khan
heeded
them
not
he
stood
glutting
his
savage
soul
with
the
sufferings
of
the
wretched
creature
before
him
and
asking
him
from
time
to
time
with
the
grin
of
a
devil
whether
he
would
disclose
his
treasures
but
the
person
he
addressed
was
speechless
and
after
nature
was
fairly
exhausted
he
sank
down
in
utter
insensibility
you
have
killed
him
i
exclaimed
for
the
love
of
alla
let
him
alone
and
let
us
depart
what
more
would
you
have
either
he
has
no
money
or
he
will
not
give
it
up
where
be
those
daughters
of
a
defiled
mother
cried
he
to
his
followers
not
heeding
what
i
said
to
him
where
are
they
bring
them
forward
that
i
may
ask
them
about
the
money
for
money
there
must
be
but
they
too
were
dead
ay
they
had
been
murdered
also
by
whom
i
know
not
but
their
bodies
were
found
in
the
next
room
weltering
in
their
blood
the
news
was
brought
to
the
khan
and
he
was
more
savage
than
ever
he
gnashed
his
teeth
like
a
wild
beast
he
was
fearful
to
look
on
the
old
man
had
revived
for
water
had
been
poured
on
his
face
and
on
his
fingers
he
raised
himself
up
looked
wildly
about
him
and
then
gazed
piteously
on
his
mutilated
hands
were
they
men
or
devils
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
by
alla
sahib
they
were
not
men
for
they
laughed
at
him
and
his
almost
unconscious
actions
speak
cried
the
khan
striking
him
with
his
sword
speak
kafir
or
more
tortures
are
in
store
for
thee
but
he
spoke
not
he
was
more
than
misery
and
torture
had
done
their
utmost
the
khan
drew
his
sword
again
he
cried
speak
as
he
raised
the
weapon
above
his
head
i
fancied
i
saw
the
old
man
lips
smile
and
move
as
though
he
would
have
spoken
he
cast
his
eyes
upwards
but
no
word
escaped
him
the
sword
was
quivering
above
his
head
in
the
nervous
grasp
of
the
khan
and
seeing
he
got
no
answer
it
descended
with
its
full
force
on
the
old
man
forehead
almost
dividing
the
head
in
two
need
i
say
he
was
instantly
dead
i
was
satisfied
ghuffoor
khan
cup
too
was
full
for
my
own
determination
was
made
on
that
spot
i
swore
it
to
myself
as
i
looked
at
the
dead
and
rushed
from
the
house
chapter
xxxvii
from
that
hour
i
made
a
determination
to
destroy
him
no
sooner
had
i
reached
the
camp
than
i
assembled
all
my
thugs
and
laid
before
them
a
scheme
i
had
long
been
revolving
in
my
mind
i
spoke
to
them
as
follows
you
have
seen
my
brethren
that
ghuffoor
khan
is
a
devil
such
a
person
can
hardly
be
called
a
man
bad
as
these
pindharees
are
he
is
the
worst
among
them
and
is
unfit
to
live
you
motee
and
peer
khan
remember
the
fate
of
the
brahmin
girl
at
karinjah
you
may
remember
my
indignation
which
then
almost
impelled
me
to
destroy
this
fiend
and
i
would
have
done
it
but
that
i
felt
his
fate
was
not
in
my
hands
i
felt
that
alla
would
sooner
or
later
urge
me
on
to
be
the
humble
means
of
a
retributive
justice
overtaking
him
i
have
hitherto
refrained
though
i
have
sometimes
fancied
his
hour
was
come
i
thought
that
some
crime
blacker
than
any
previous
one
would
at
last
be
committed
by
him
and
it
has
been
done
you
all
saw
what
it
was
can
he
ever
do
worse
he
can
not
cried
my
men
with
one
voice
he
has
reached
the
mark
and
he
is
ours
he
shall
be
so
said
i
now
listen
you
know
i
have
still
three
bottles
of
the
sweet
wine
of
the
feringhees
which
i
brought
with
me
from
guntoor
he
is
very
fond
of
it
and
will
easily
be
persuaded
to
come
here
and
drink
it
with
us
i
will
dose
his
share
with
opium
and
after
a
few
cups
he
will
become
stupified
and
will
fall
an
easy
prey
to
us
good
cried
peer
khan
it
is
an
excellent
plan
what
say
you
to
putting
it
into
execution
this
very
night
not
i
said
we
must
be
cautious
in
this
immense
camp
let
my
tent
be
pitched
on
the
utmost
verge
of
it
nay
a
short
distance
beyond
it
and
in
the
dead
of
the
night
when
all
are
overpowered
by
sleep
he
can
be
despatched
i
beg
to
represent
said
peer
khan
that
ghuffoor
khan
saddle
is
well
lined
could
we
not
get
possession
of
it
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
replied
i
but
i
do
not
see
how
we
are
to
get
it
without
much
risk
and
fear
of
discovery
peer
khan
pondered
for
a
moment
he
then
said
i
have
a
plan
jemadar
which
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
improve
upon
and
inshalla
we
will
have
the
saddle
what
i
say
is
this
when
the
khan
is
pretty
well
intoxicated
do
you
propose
to
him
to
sleep
in
your
tent
and
to
send
for
his
horse
and
saddle
so
as
to
be
near
him
to
mount
in
the
morning
if
the
saddle
is
brought
we
can
empty
it
of
its
contents
and
bury
it
with
him
if
not
we
can
only
rejoice
at
having
done
a
good
action
in
having
destroyed
him
i
am
not
sure
observed
motee
that
the
omens
will
be
good
we
had
better
try
them
do
so
said
i
i
will
think
over
peer
khan
plan
and
see
what
can
be
done
we
then
separated
for
the
night
during
the
next
morning
travel
when
we
were
not
separated
by
the
confusion
which
ensued
on
a
village
or
town
being
plundered
i
purposely
threw
myself
as
much
in
ghuffoor
khan
way
as
i
could
and
we
conversed
on
the
success
of
our
expedition
and
the
adventures
which
had
befallen
us
do
you
remember
khan
sahib
said
i
the
attack
on
the
houses
at
guntoor
and
how
we
ravaged
the
feringhees
in
a
vain
search
for
valuables
my
curses
on
them
they
are
as
rich
as
nuwabs
and
yet
not
one
of
them
has
a
gold
or
silver
dish
in
his
possession
nor
a
jewel
or
valuable
of
any
kind
nothing
but
and
do
you
remember
how
we
smashed
it
all
ay
i
remember
growled
the
khan
and
but
for
our
cowardice
between
you
and
me
i
say
it
we
might
have
attacked
and
carried
the
place
where
the
treasure
was
and
enriched
ourselves
not
a
little
whereas
as
it
was
we
got
nothing
for
our
trouble
we
destroyed
their
houses
however
and
that
was
some
satisfaction
true
said
i
it
was
khan
how
their
hearts
must
have
burned
as
they
saw
the
bright
flames
devouring
their
abodes
do
you
remember
too
the
precious
stuff
i
got
hold
of
and
recommended
to
your
notice
the
wine
in
the
small
bottles
with
printed
papers
upon
them
it
was
rare
good
stuff
mashalla
it
was
indeed
cried
the
khan
the
flavour
of
it
did
not
leave
my
lips
for
some
days
these
infidels
know
what
good
wine
is
that
is
certain
would
that
i
had
brought
some
with
me
a
few
bottles
would
have
been
easily
carried
and
one
would
have
enjoyed
it
after
a
day
toil
i
was
more
careful
than
you
were
khan
such
wine
is
not
always
to
be
got
i
brought
away
some
bottles
and
i
have
them
still
i
believe
if
they
be
not
broken
some
with
you
nay
then
be
not
niggardly
of
your
treasure
let
me
taste
it
again
for
i
swear
to
you
i
believe
there
will
be
no
such
nectar
in
paradise
it
is
at
your
service
khan
but
to
escape
scandal
what
do
you
say
to
coming
to
my
tent
when
it
is
dusk
that
is
if
any
remains
of
which
i
will
give
you
notice
one
of
my
fellows
shall
cook
a
good
pilao
and
after
it
we
will
enjoy
the
wine
quietly
your
words
are
as
sweet
as
the
wine
itself
good
meer
sahib
truly
i
will
be
with
thee
i
will
tell
my
saees
to
bring
my
horse
and
picket
him
among
yours
no
one
will
see
me
and
i
will
bring
no
one
with
me
i
might
exceed
you
know
and
i
would
not
be
an
open
scandal
to
the
faith
my
heart
leaped
to
my
mouth
as
he
uttered
the
words
the
saddle
then
would
be
ours
without
any
trouble
or
risk
of
detection
how
i
blessed
him
for
acceding
so
readily
to
my
plans
true
khan
said
i
it
will
not
do
to
be
observed
we
must
be
secret
i
will
have
no
one
in
my
tent
but
peer
khan
whom
you
know
he
is
my
and
a
rare
companion
we
will
have
a
pleasant
carouse
i
will
send
him
to
you
when
the
pilao
is
ready
no
no
cried
he
do
not
there
is
no
need
of
it
i
will
stroll
to
your
tent
after
dusk
and
hark
ye
said
he
to
his
saees
who
was
trotting
after
him
mind
you
are
to
bring
my
horse
and
saddle
to
the
meer
sahib
tent
as
soon
as
you
see
me
going
towards
it
remember
you
are
to
lead
it
after
me
as
though
i
were
going
to
ride
and
when
you
arrive
there
you
are
to
picket
it
among
his
horses
jo
hookum
replied
the
fellow
your
orders
shall
be
obeyed
and
mind
continued
the
khan
you
are
not
to
tell
any
one
where
i
am
going
nor
to
answer
any
questions
if
any
are
put
to
you
as
you
lead
the
horse
along
certainly
not
since
such
is
my
lord
pleasure
i
dare
not
disobey
you
had
better
not
cried
the
khan
or
i
will
try
and
find
a
korla
for
you
the
fellow
dropped
behind
again
and
we
resumed
our
desultory
conversation
chatting
as
we
rode
along
on
the
merits
of
the
different
leaders
and
how
they
had
behaved
ghuffoor
khan
was
a
pleasant
companion
and
his
remarks
were
full
of
wit
and
satire
i
had
put
him
in
good
humour
by
the
prospect
of
a
deep
carouse
and
we
rode
on
cheerfully
we
reached
our
for
the
day
after
a
long
and
intensely
hot
march
and
glad
were
we
to
get
under
the
cover
of
our
tents
to
screen
ourselves
from
the
noonday
heat
i
had
several
messages
from
the
khan
in
the
course
of
the
day
to
know
whether
the
repast
was
ready
but
it
would
not
have
answered
my
purpose
to
have
allowed
that
it
was
or
to
have
had
it
prepared
one
moment
before
the
time
fixed
you
have
been
riding
with
the
khan
sahib
all
the
morning
said
motee
to
me
and
have
not
i
suppose
observed
the
omens
i
have
not
said
i
anxiously
but
surely
you
have
done
so
for
i
knew
how
much
they
would
influence
my
men
nay
that
without
favourable
ones
they
would
have
absolutely
refused
any
participation
in
the
matter
i
have
not
been
negligent
replied
motee
last
night
after
i
parted
with
you
peer
khan
myself
and
the
others
made
an
offering
of
goor
to
the
nishan
and
blessed
be
bhowanee
she
has
vouchsafed
us
the
thibao
and
pilhao
you
need
therefore
be
under
no
apprehensions
for
she
is
favourable
i
was
sure
she
would
be
motee
for
i
observe
the
hand
of
alla
guiding
me
and
i
verily
believe
i
should
have
followed
the
influence
of
my
own
desires
in
this
matter
even
had
they
been
unfavourable
nay
say
not
so
jemadar
said
he
laughing
you
are
too
good
a
thug
for
that
but
there
is
now
no
fear
for
the
omens
were
indeed
cheering
if
we
succeed
said
i
i
have
some
thoughts
of
further
work
in
our
own
way
but
of
this
more
hereafter
there
will
be
a
stir
when
his
disappearance
is
known
and
we
must
be
quiet
for
a
time
ay
that
is
like
you
jemadar
we
have
been
consulting
among
ourselves
and
had
come
to
the
determination
of
proposing
some
adventures
to
you
for
here
these
dogs
of
pindharees
lie
night
after
night
and
each
fellow
is
worth
some
hundreds
of
rupees
yet
we
have
been
content
to
remain
inactive
and
i
for
one
say
shame
on
us
we
need
not
pass
a
night
without
some
work
wait
good
motee
let
us
secure
the
khan
first
and
now
to
arrange
matters
we
must
be
our
own
lughaees
for
that
we
are
prepared
meer
sahib
a
thug
must
do
his
duty
in
any
grade
when
occasion
calls
for
his
services
we
are
all
ready
for
work
then
we
must
lose
no
time
you
must
join
your
own
pall
to
mine
and
put
some
screen
or
other
between
them
in
the
empty
space
the
grave
must
be
prepared
it
had
better
be
ready
before
he
comes
but
no
he
will
perhaps
suspect
us
it
can
soon
be
made
afterwards
you
are
right
jemadar
he
would
suspect
he
need
not
be
buried
deep
and
there
are
three
of
our
men
who
are
old
lughaees
they
will
prepare
it
in
a
few
minutes
and
his
saees
he
must
die
also
motee
certainly
he
replied
do
you
and
peer
khan
deal
with
the
khan
and
leave
the
saees
to
us
we
will
manage
him
good
our
arrangements
are
then
complete
remember
that
peer
khan
alone
eats
with
us
you
must
be
all
outside
and
see
that
the
horses
are
kept
saddled
for
we
must
fly
instantly
if
we
are
discovered
or
suspected
i
have
no
fears
however
on
either
score
nor
have
i
said
motee
the
matter
will
create
a
stir
as
he
is
a
leader
of
note
but
it
will
be
supposed
either
that
he
has
gone
off
with
his
plunder
or
that
some
one
has
murdered
him
i
tell
you
meer
sahib
that
many
a
pindharee
has
died
by
the
hand
of
his
fellow
since
we
left
nemawur
i
do
not
doubt
it
motee
i
have
heard
of
many
brawls
and
men
of
this
kind
have
but
few
scruples
they
are
a
wicked
set
and
far
worse
than
those
who
formed
the
first
expedition
but
now
go
get
the
pall
ready
and
send
peer
khan
to
me
the
evening
came
the
calls
of
the
faithful
to
evening
prayers
resounded
through
the
camp
with
the
last
red
streak
of
day
men
were
assembled
in
knots
kneeling
on
their
carpets
addressing
their
prayers
to
alla
men
whose
hands
were
scarcely
cleansed
from
the
blood
they
had
that
day
shed
the
ceremony
over
each
separated
from
his
fellow
to
lie
beside
his
faithful
horse
and
to
enjoy
a
night
of
repose
to
fit
him
for
the
toil
the
rapine
and
plunder
of
the
ensuing
day
the
time
approached
and
as
i
sat
in
my
tent
awaiting
the
khan
arrival
my
heart
exulted
within
me
that
for
once
in
my
life
i
should
do
a
good
action
in
revenging
the
murdered
peer
khan
was
with
me
we
scarcely
spoke
our
minds
were
too
full
of
what
was
to
follow
to
speak
much
have
you
drugged
the
bottle
he
asked
i
have
i
have
put
two
tolas
of
opium
into
it
i
have
tasted
it
and
the
flavour
of
the
drug
is
perceptible
but
it
will
be
the
second
bottle
and
he
will
not
discover
it
and
if
he
does
we
can
not
help
it
we
must
take
our
chance
do
you
think
we
can
manage
him
between
us
without
any
noise
shame
on
us
if
we
do
not
meer
sahib
i
am
as
strong
a
man
as
he
is
and
your
roomal
never
fails
but
to
prevent
any
noise
being
heard
suppose
we
propose
to
admit
motee
and
two
or
three
others
to
sing
and
play
i
mean
when
the
khan
has
swallowed
his
first
bottle
motee
has
a
sitar
and
a
small
drum
with
him
and
its
noise
will
drown
all
others
no
no
said
i
others
might
be
attracted
by
the
singing
and
come
to
hear
it
it
will
not
do
we
must
do
our
best
and
leave
the
rest
to
alla
however
we
will
see
when
the
time
comes
the
evening
was
far
advanced
and
everything
around
us
was
quiet
a
few
fires
here
and
there
throughout
the
camp
marked
where
at
each
a
solitary
pindharee
cooked
his
last
meal
of
the
day
the
rest
were
already
buried
in
profound
slumber
and
all
nearest
to
us
were
still
i
stood
at
the
door
of
my
humble
tent
looking
anxiously
for
the
coming
and
at
length
i
observed
a
figure
stealing
along
in
the
dusk
carefully
avoiding
the
prostrate
forms
which
lay
in
his
path
was
it
the
khan
yes
by
alla
he
comes
said
i
to
peer
khan
i
see
him
now
and
there
is
his
horse
behind
him
and
the
saees
leading
it
shookur
khoda
exclaimed
my
companion
he
has
not
deceived
us
i
feared
he
had
since
it
is
so
late
is
that
you
meer
sahib
cried
the
voice
of
ghuffoor
khan
i
feared
i
should
have
missed
your
tent
in
this
cursed
darkness
here
am
i
khan
and
you
are
welcome
to
the
poor
tent
of
your
servant
so
you
have
found
the
wine
eh
said
the
khan
rubbing
his
hands
in
glee
you
have
not
cheated
me
by
your
soul
no
khan
i
have
not
there
it
is
you
see
and
peer
khan
is
gone
for
the
pilao
khoob
by
alla
meer
sahib
i
have
fasted
all
day
on
purpose
to
do
justice
to
it
and
i
should
have
been
here
an
hour
sooner
but
i
was
summoned
to
the
durbar
about
some
trifle
or
other
and
i
have
kept
you
waiting
and
your
horse
khan
oh
he
is
here
my
saees
has
picketed
him
among
yours
i
have
deceived
my
other
servants
i
swore
i
had
a
headache
and
could
not
eat
and
pretended
to
lie
down
to
sleep
having
given
them
all
strict
orders
not
to
disturb
me
the
knaves
knew
better
than
to
do
so
and
so
after
lying
quiet
awhile
i
stole
out
of
my
tent
behind
and
have
fairly
given
them
the
slip
i
suppose
your
people
can
throw
some
fodder
before
the
animal
surely
i
have
cared
for
that
already
peer
khan
now
entered
with
the
pilao
and
seating
ourselves
our
fingers
were
soon
buried
in
the
midst
of
it
now
for
the
wine
meer
sahib
the
pilao
is
dry
without
it
and
my
throat
lacks
moisture
here
it
is
said
i
pouring
it
out
into
a
cup
see
how
it
sparkles
like
the
fire
of
a
ruby
ay
said
the
khan
after
he
had
drained
it
to
the
bottom
this
is
wine
for
the
hooris
how
one
enjoys
it
think
meer
sahib
how
we
true
believers
will
quaff
in
paradise
if
what
we
get
there
will
be
as
good
surrounded
by
twenty
hooris
and
each
vying
with
the
other
to
please
us
but
drink
man
i
would
not
take
the
whole
nay
that
bottle
is
your
own
share
khan
and
there
is
besides
another
for
you
peer
khan
and
i
will
divide
this
one
between
us
is
a
pity
there
is
not
more
or
that
the
bottles
were
not
larger
ay
it
is
to
be
regretted
certainly
meer
sahib
but
what
there
is
we
must
make
the
most
of
and
he
took
another
draught
only
think
continued
he
of
those
infidels
the
feringhees
drinking
such
stuff
as
this
every
day
i
now
scarcely
marvel
at
their
doing
great
deeds
when
they
are
drunk
and
is
it
not
the
case
meer
sahib
that
they
all
sit
round
a
table
and
drink
and
roar
out
songs
till
they
fall
down
intoxicated
so
i
have
been
credibly
informed
khan
by
alla
they
are
jolly
dogs
i
wish
i
was
in
their
service
said
ghuffoor
khan
after
a
short
silence
do
you
think
they
would
give
one
wine
to
drink
when
one
wanted
it
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
replied
then
i
will
take
employ
with
them
meer
sahib
this
stuff
would
tempt
many
a
better
moosulman
than
i
am
to
serve
an
infidel
but
they
say
sikundar
jah
drinks
it
also
so
i
heard
when
i
was
at
hyderabad
said
i
indeed
it
was
there
i
first
tasted
this
liquor
and
i
knew
the
bottles
again
when
i
saw
them
in
the
feringhees
houses
at
guntoor
it
is
fit
drink
for
a
prince
sighed
the
khan
when
he
had
finished
the
bottle
and
looking
at
it
with
a
most
rueful
countenance
that
is
finished
meer
sahib
thou
saidst
thou
hadst
another
ay
khan
but
only
this
one
i
replied
handing
him
the
other
i
feel
happy
now
meer
sahib
by
alla
i
could
sing
i
could
dance
i
think
though
it
would
be
a
scandal
to
do
so
the
prophet
however
has
not
forbidden
a
moslem
to
sing
may
his
name
be
honoured
have
any
of
you
a
sitar
people
say
that
i
have
a
good
hand
go
and
fetch
said
i
to
peer
khan
it
is
a
good
one
shall
the
owner
of
it
come
also
khan
nay
i
care
not
meer
sahib
though
the
devil
came
i
would
pluck
him
by
the
beard
let
him
come
can
he
sing
like
a
bulbul
khan
i
have
rarely
heard
a
better
voice
from
a
man
oh
for
some
women
sighed
the
khan
one
misses
the
glances
of
their
antelope
eyes
and
the
tinkle
of
their
anklets
in
moments
like
these
ah
meer
sahib
we
were
happy
dogs
when
we
were
encamped
in
the
krishna
there
was
one
charmer
but
why
speak
of
them
meer
sahib
why
speak
of
them
we
shall
enjoy
their
company
the
more
when
we
get
to
nemawur
said
i
but
here
is
motee
with
his
sitar
motee
made
his
salam
and
sat
down
is
the
instrument
tuned
motee
thou
pearl
of
singers
cried
the
khan
bursting
into
a
laugh
at
his
play
upon
motee
name
hast
thou
tuned
it
i
have
noble
khan
though
it
is
not
worthy
the
touch
of
so
exalted
a
person
nay
is
a
good
sitar
and
a
sweet
one
said
the
khan
as
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
strings
in
a
manner
which
showed
him
to
be
a
proficient
wah
cried
all
of
us
at
once
play
noble
khan
the
hand
which
could
execute
such
a
prelude
as
that
can
do
wonders
give
me
some
more
drink
cried
he
and
i
will
try
knowest
thou
any
ghuzuls
motee
i
am
indifferently
skilled
in
them
khan
sahib
nevertheless
if
my
lord
will
mention
one
i
will
try
the
tuppas
of
my
own
country
i
know
most
of
pah
cried
the
khan
who
would
sing
tuppas
i
will
name
a
ghuzul
which
is
in
every
one
mouth
sing
i
warrant
me
thou
knowest
it
but
the
wine
meer
sahib
pour
it
out
for
me
thou
art
my
saqi
thou
knowest
i
will
sing
an
ode
to
thee
as
hafiz
has
written
and
sung
many
a
one
to
his
peace
be
to
his
memory
ah
that
was
good
but
oh
meer
sahib
it
hath
a
different
flavour
from
the
last
very
likely
said
i
the
bottle
you
see
hath
a
different
paper
on
it
perhaps
it
is
a
better
kind
it
is
good
and
that
is
all
i
care
for
meer
sahib
now
proceed
good
motee
motee
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
his
voice
and
the
accompaniment
were
worthy
of
a
better
audience
than
that
which
heard
them
wah
wah
shabash
cried
peer
khan
and
i
when
it
was
ended
this
is
rare
fortune
to
hear
two
such
skilful
musicians
in
this
unsainted
jungle
now
it
is
your
turn
khan
sahib
more
wine
meer
sahib
mera
more
wine
for
the
sake
of
the
twelve
imams
oh
that
there
were
a
thousand
bottles
that
we
could
meet
as
we
have
done
now
every
night
good
wine
and
good
companions
have
they
not
been
ever
the
burthen
of
the
songs
of
the
poets
is
there
much
left
he
continued
when
he
had
drained
the
cup
about
half
the
bottle
said
i
then
give
motee
a
cup
meer
sahib
he
deserves
it
excuse
me
said
motee
but
i
am
a
hindoo
and
a
brahmin
thou
shouldst
have
been
a
true
believer
motee
khan
would
sound
as
well
after
thy
name
as
ram
why
man
our
blessed
prophet
would
have
had
thee
to
sing
to
him
when
thou
hadst
reached
paradise
ghuffoor
khan
voice
was
now
rather
thick
and
he
made
but
a
poor
hand
of
the
ghuzul
he
attempted
but
it
was
very
laughable
to
see
him
roll
his
eyes
from
side
to
side
like
a
and
to
hear
him
trying
to
imitate
their
quavers
and
shakes
pah
cried
he
when
he
had
sung
a
verse
my
throat
is
dry
i
want
more
wine
i
think
meer
sahib
but
the
truth
is
i
caught
a
cold
some
days
ago
and
am
still
hoarse
he
tried
again
after
a
fresh
draught
but
with
no
better
success
in
vain
he
coughed
and
hemmed
to
clear
his
throat
the
wine
and
the
still

this
country
which
spoils
a
man
singing

and
i
will
play
it
can
not
spoil
that
at
any
rate
and
the
meer
sahib
hath
provided
an
antidote
for
this
night
at
least
motee
sang
again
but
the
accompaniment
was
wild
and
irregular
and
the
khan
at
last
threw
down
the
sitar
it
will
not
do
meer
sahib
after
the
fatigue
a
hiccup
and
the
trouble
i
have
had
hiccup
all

shouting
and
bullying
these
rascally
pindharees
hiccup
how
can
it
be
expected

ghuffoor
khan
the
leader
of
three
thousand
horse
should
play
and
sing

and
there

the
khan

will
drink

and
their
mothers
too
nevertheless
as
i
said
i
will
serve
them
and
drink
among
them
and
none
shall
drink
more
than
ghuffoor
khan
thou
saidst
they
drink
standing
and
what
do
they
say
hip
hip
hip
said
i
i
learned
the
words
from
a
vagabond
who
had
been
a
khidmutgar
among
them
and
had
seen
their
wild
orgies
what
hip
hip
hip
those
are
the
words
eh
i
wonder
what
they
mean
they
are
an
invocation
to
their
prophet

i
much
as
we
say

ruhman
ir
ruheem
i
do
not
doubt
it

my
brain

round
about

say
and
i
will
quaff
the
last
drop
both
as
a
true
moslem
and
as
a
feringhee
ha
said
i
not
well
excellently
well
great
khan
said
i
as
i
helped
him
to
his
feet
now
here
is
the
wine
bismilla
shouted
the
khan
hip
hip
hip
and
he
drained
the
cup
to
the
bottom
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
his
eyes
rolled
wildly
he
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
rush
forward
and
fell
at
his
full
length
upon
the
ground
bus
cried
peer
khan
as
he
got
out
of
the
way
enough
great
khan
noble
khan

a
dead
man
now
feringhee
and

made
rare
fun
for
us

said
i
to
them
seat
him
on
his
end
i
am
ready
and
do
one
of
ye
give
the
jhirnee
they
raised
him
up
and
as
he
was
seated
his
head
again
sunk
on
his
shoulder
and
some
froth
came
from
his
mouth
he
is
dying
said
motee
we
ought
not
to
touch
him
it
is
forbidden
not
a
bit
of
it
said
i
all
drunken
men
are
in
this
way
i
have
seen
hundreds
in
the
same
state
so
hold
his
head
up
and
give
the
jhirnee
for
i
had
taken
my
post
behind
him
they
did
so
peer
khan
uttered
the
fatal
words
and
ghuffoor
khan
wrestled
out
his
last
agony
under
my
gripe
enough
meer
sahib
said
peer
khan
who
was
holding
his
feet
enough
he
is
dead
i
exclaimed
it
is
finished
blessed
be
the
prophet
and
bhowanee
go
for
the
lughaees
he
must
be
put
under
ground
immediately
now
for
the
saees
we
left
the
khan
body
and
went
out
the
others
were
waiting
for
us
where
does
he
lie
i
asked
there
said
one
of
the
men
he
is
fast
asleep
and
has
been
so
for
an
hour
so
much
the
better
said
peer
khan
leave
him
to
me
i
watched
him
and
motee
as
they
approached
the
sleeper
peer
khan
touched
him
with
his
foot
he
started
up
to
a
sitting
position
and
rubbed
his
eyes
but
peer
khan
threw
himself
upon
him
and
he
was
dead
in
an
instant
ere
he
had
become
conscious
nothing
now
remained
but
the
disposal
of
the
bodies
and
the
saddle
the
grave
a
shallow
one
was
quickly
dug
and
while
the
lughaees
were
preparing
it
myself
peer
khan
and
motee
unripped
the
lining
and
pockets
of
the
saddle
and
took
out
the
gold
there
was
naught
else
it
was
in
coin
and
in
small
lumps
as
the
jewels
he
had
gotten
in
plunders
had
been
melted
down
from
time
to
time
we
had
no
leisure
then
to
speculate
on
its
value
but
we
cut
the
saddle
to
pieces
with
our
knives
to
make
sure
that
none
remained
in
it
and
the
fragments
were
buried
with
the
bodies
what
shall
we
do
with
the
horse
meer
sahib
asked
motee
we
can
not
take
him
with
us
for
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
camp
who
does
not
know
ghuffoor
khan
horse
and
we
have
no
time
to
stain
him
i
was
puzzled
for
a
while
to
have
retained
the
noble
animal
would
have
ensured
our
detection
and
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
at
last
i
hit
upon
an
expedient
he
must
be
destroyed
said
i
is
a
splendid
beast
certainly
yet
our
lives
are
worth
more
than
his
beyond
the
camp
about
an
arrow
flight
is
a
deep
ravine
do
any
of
you
know
it
none
of
us
have
seen
it
said
all
at
once
then
i
must
go
myself
and
do
you
ghous
khan
he
was
one
of
my
men
accompany
me
we
will
throw
him
into
it
go
and
loosen
him
from
his
pickets
i
followed
him
and
we
conducted
the
animal
to
the
edge
of
the
ravine
it
was
deep
and
just
suited
our
purpose
as
the
banks
were
precipitous
that
will
do
said
i
when
he
had
brought
the
horse
to
the
edge
now
rein
his
head
to
one
side
we
must
kill
him
before
he
falls
in
he
did
so
i
had
prepared
my
sword
and
drew
it
sharply
across
the
poor
brute
throat
the
blood
gushed
out
he
reeled
backwards
fell
into
the
dark
ravine
and
we
heard
his
carcase
reach
the
bottom
with
a
heavy
fall
i
looked
over
but
all
i
saw
was
an
indistinct
mass
at
the
bottom
while
a
few
groans
of
its
reached
my
ears
enough
said
i
come
away
the
jackals
will
have
a
glorious
feast
ere
morning
and
no
one
will
ever
think
of
looking
here
but
it
was
a
pity
to
kill
the
brute
he
was
worth
a
good
thousand
rupees
and
would
have
fetched
that
price
at
hyderabad
why
did
you
not
send
him
there
i
would
have
taken
him
i
did
not
think
of
that
said
i
but
no
matter
now
we
will
earn
more
than
that
before
we
reach
nemawur
how
meer
sahib
we
get
but
little
in
this
poor
country
trust
me
ghous
khan
said
i
we
have
begun
and
inshalla
we
will
go
on
with
the
work
i
reached
the
tent
and
the
lughaees
had
done
their
business
well
our
carpets
had
been
spread
over
the
spot
where
the
khan
lay
in
his
last
and
we
all
lay
down
and
slept
soundly
ghuffoor
khan
was
missed
at
his
accustomed
post
the
next
morning
a
thousand
conjectures
were
hazarded
as
to
his
fate
but
no
one
could
account
for
his
disappearance
some
said
the
devil
had
taken
him
for
his
wickedness
others
that
he
had
amassed
an
immense
plunder
and
was
fearful
of
its
being
wrested
from
him
and
he
had
therefore
escaped
with
it
as
it
was
known
to
be
sewed
up
in
his
saddle
when
we
reached
our
next
encampment
cheetoo
sent
for
me
i
went
and
found
him
seated
in
full
durbar
and
the
khan
servants
as
prisoners
before
him
i
made
my
usual
salam
and
he
requested
me
to
be
seated
near
him
this
is
a
most
mysterious
affair
meer
sahib
said
he
ghuffoor
khan
is
gone
and
alla
or
the
shitan
only
knows
whither
if
he
has
fled
it
is
as
extraordinary
a
thing
as
i
ever
heard
of
for
he
has
been
attached
to
me
from
his
youth
and
i
have
ever
been
kind
to
him
what
think
you
i
am
at
a
loss
also
said
i
your
servant
knows
not
what
to
say
there
are
a
thousand
conjectures
afloat
but
no
one
can
give
any
probable
solution
to
the
mystery
but
have
you
examined
the
servants
surely
they
must
know
something
i
have
not
meer
sahib
as
yet
but
here
they
are
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
question
them
you
may
think
of
some
things
which
may
escape
me
i
will
do
my
best
nuwab
but
you
had
better
begin
they
will
be
afraid
of
you
and
speak
the
truth
call
one
of
them
said
cheetoo
to
an
attendant
the
man
came
trembling
in
every
joint
and
prostrated
himself
before
our
leader
what
is
thy
name
he
asked
syud
ebrahim
said
the
fellow
and
what
service
didst
thou
perform
to
ghuffoor
khan
i
am
a
khidmutgar
o
asylum
of
the
world
said
the
man
i
used
to
keep
the
khan
clothes
assist
him
to
bathe
and
attend
him
at
night
i
was
always
about
his
person
now
speak
the
truth
ebrahim
and
fear
not
but
i
swear
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
if
i
detect
thee
lying
i
will
have
thee
cut
to
pieces
before
my
face
as
a
warning
to
thy
comrades
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
cried
the
man
i
will
not
lie
why
should
i
what
i
know
is
easily
told
and
is
but
little
proceed
cried
cheetoo
and
remember
what
i
have
said
alla
is
my
witness
said
the
man
i
know
but
little
my
noble
master
came
from
your
highness
durbar
late
in
the
afternoon
we
had
prepared
dinner
for
him
but
he
said
he
was
ill
and
would
not
eat
and
that
we
ourselves
might
eat
what
we
had
cooked
for
him
he
then
went
into
his
tent
took
off
his
durbar
dress
put
away
his
arms
and
then
lay
down
i
was
with
him
till
this
time
and
sat
down
to
shampoo
him
but
he
bade
me
begone
and
i
left
him
i
was
weary
with
running
all
day
by
his
side
and
i
also
lay
down
and
did
not
wake
till
the
people
roused
me
for
the
march
i
went
into
the
tent
to
arouse
him
and
give
him
his
clothes
but
i
found
him
not
the
bedding
was
just
as
when
he
had
lain
down
but
his
sword
was
not
there
nor
a
stick
he
always
walked
with
this
is
all
i
know
but
shekh
qadir
knows
something
more
if
you
will
call
him
he
saw
the
khan
after
i
did
shekh
qadir
was
accordingly
sent
for
and
after
being
cautioned
and
threatened
as
the
other
had
been
he
spoke
as
follows
i
am
also
a
khidmutgar
but
my
office
was
not
about
the
khan
person
i
used
to
give
him
his
hooka
and
prepare
the
opium
he
ate
soon
after
dusk
i
heard
him
moving
in
the
tent
and
i
watched
him
he
lifted
up
the
back
part
of
it
and
came
out
i
saw
him
walk
towards
the
middle
of
the
camp
and
followed
him
he
observed
me
and
turned
round
sharp
upon
me
said
he
can
not
i
walk
out
for
a
few
yards
to
breathe
the
air
without
some
of
you
rascals
following
me
begone
nuwab
i
was
frightened
lest
he
should
order
me
the
korla
and
i
went
away
to
the
tent
of
a
friend
i
heard
in
the
morning
that
he
had
not
returned
this
is
very
unsatisfactory
said
i
we
have
as
yet
no
clue
to
his
disappearance
if
he
has
gone
away
he
must
have
ridden
where
is
his
horse
ay
where
is
it
cried
cheetoo
who
can
tell
us
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
said
shekh
qadir
the
horse
is
not
here
nor
his
saees
the
khan
had
two
horses
but
the
saddle
of
the
one
missing
is
that
in
which
all
the
gold
was
sewed
up
ha
said
cheetoo
is
it
so
where
is
the
other
saees
cried
an
attendant
he
is
waiting
without
let
him
too
be
called
the
man
entered
what
knowest
thou
asked
cheetoo
i
only
know
said
the
fellow
that
the
gray
horse
was
kept
saddled
all
the
afternoon
this
was
contrary
to
custom
for
its
saddle
was
always
placed
in
the
tent
near
the
khan
head
when
he
slept
i
asked
my
fellow
saees
the
reason
of
its
being
so
but
he
was
angry
with
me
and
said
it
was
no
business
of
mine
that
the
khan
had
ordered
it
and
it
was
his
pleasure
i
saw
him
take
the
horse
from
his
picket
after
dark
but
i
asked
no
questions
there
remains
but
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
nuwab
sahib
said
i
ghuffoor
khan
has
fled
and
made
off
with
the
booty
he
had
got
by
all
accounts
he
had
been
very
fortunate
and
every
one
said
his
saddle
was
stuffed
with
gold
so
i
have
also
heard
said
cheetoo
but
yet
it
is
hard
to
think
of
that
man
ingratitude
here
have
i
been
associated
with
him
from
boyhood
i
have
raised
him
from
obscurity
to
be
a
leader
of
three
thousand
horse
and
this
has
been
a
scurvy
ending
to
my
kindness
go
said
he
to
the
servants
i
find
no
fault
with
any
of
you
take
the
horse
to
my
pagah
and
let
him
be
tied
up
among
my
own
thus
ended
this
adventure
no
suspicion
fell
upon
us
nor
on
any
one
the
khan
was
known
to
have
friends
at
hyderabad
and
thither
it
was
supposed
he
had
fled
we
alone
knew
his
fate
and
it
was
one
he
had
deserved
by
a
thousand
crimes
too
horrible
to
mention
but
after
this
we
were
not
idle
having
begun
our
work
we
had
constant
employment
scarcely
a
night
passed
that
one
or
two
pindharees
did
not
fall
by
our
hands
they
were
missed
too
as
the
khan
had
been
but
we
were
favoured
by
the
constant
desertions
which
took
place
from
the
lubhur
for
as
we
approached
nemawur
men
daily
made
off
in
every
direction
to
their
houses
little
relishing
the
fatigues
of
the
camp
and
the
constant
alarms
we
had
from
reports
of
the
vicinity
of
the
feringhee
troops
by
whom
we
were
several
times
nearly
surprised
yet
i
was
not
fated
to
have
the
uniform
success
which
had
hitherto
attended
me
treachery
was
at
work
and
the
blow
we
least
feared
fell
with
a
heavy
hand
at
last
and
dispersed
us
i
will
tell
you
how
it
happened
and
what
befel
us
chapter
xxxviii
among
the
men
whom
i
had
brought
with
me
from
jhalone
was
one
by
name
hidayut
khan
i
had
never
seen
him
before
but
he
was
slightly
known
to
peer
khan
as
having
served
with
him
and
was
represented
to
be
an
able
thug
of
the
extent
of
his
accomplishments
i
was
ignorant
as
he
never
had
any
hand
in
the
destruction
of
those
who
died
in
the
pindharee
camp
for
i
preferred
allowing
my
own
men
upon
whom
i
could
depend
to
do
the
work
but
hidayut
khan
was
certainly
a
capital
horseman
a
good
hand
with
his
sword
and
spear
and
an
active
enterprising
fellow
as
a
pindharee
i
have
said
we
never
employed
him
as
a
bhuttote
nor
even
as
a
shumshea
why
i
can
hardly
say
yet
so
it
was
he
acted
always
as
a
scout
and
kept
watch
at
the
door
of
the
tent
while
our
work
went
on
within
many
days
after
the
death
of
ghuffoor
khan
indeed
when
we
had
again
reached
the
nagpoor
territory
and
when
a
few
days
march
would
have
brought
us
to
nemawur
peer
khan
motee
and
one
or
two
others
came
to
me
one
evening
after
it
was
dark
with
faces
full
of
concern
and
alarm
for
the
sake
of
bhowanee
cried
i
what
is
the
matter
why
are
ye
thus
agitated
speak
brothers
and
say
the
worst
are
we
discovered
alas
i
fear
treachery
said
motee
for
some
time
past
we
have
suspected
hidayut
khan
who
has
absented
himself
from
us
of
late
in
an
extraordinary
manner
to
have
disclosed
what
we
are
to
a
person
in
cheetoo
confidence
we
have
dogged
them
several
times
about
the
camp
have
detected
them
in
earnest
conversation
and
this
night
we
too
greatly
fear
he
is
even
now
in
the
durbar
what
can
be
done
we
must
fly
at
once
said
i
now
that
you
mention
the
name
of
hidayut
khan
i
too
have
my
suspicions
are
the
horses
saddled
they
are
said
peer
khan
they
are
always
so
good
said
i
then
there
is
no
fear
yet
i
should
like
much
to
satisfy
myself
of
the
fact
of
our
being
suspected
ay
and
by
alla
i
will
ascertain
it
at
once
ah
do
not
cried
they
for
the
sake
of
bhowanee
do
not
throw
yourself
into
peril
what
can
be
gained
by
it
our
horses
are
ready
let
us
mount
them
leave
the
tent
where
it
is
and
fly
would
to
alla
that
i
had
followed
this
wise
counsel
matters
would
not
have
turned
out
as
they
did
but
i
was
possessed
by
the
idea
a
headstrong
man
is
never
to
be
restrained
and
i
would
hear
nothing
they
had
to
say
is
there
not
among
you
cried
i
who
will
accompany
me
the
night
is
dark
and
we
can
reach
cheetoo
tent
unobserved
we
will
lie
down
with
our
ears
to
the
kanât
and
hear
what
passes
if
the
worst
comes
if
we
really
are
denounced
we
shall
have
ample
time
to
fly
before
they
can
get
from
the
inside
i
will
cried
peer
khan
but
no
one
else
stirred
they
were
all
paralysed
by
fear
and
were
incapable
of
action
that
is
spoken
like
yourself
brother
cried
i
thou
hast
a
gallant
soul
now
do
ye
all
prepare
the
horses
for
instant
flight
let
their
be
loosened
and
the
bridles
put
in
their
mouths
do
not
move
them
from
their
places
and
no
one
will
suspect
us
and
come
cried
i
to
peer
khan
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
we
stole
out
of
the
tent
and
stealthily
crept
along
towards
cheetoo
which
was
fortunately
at
no
great
distance
no
one
was
about
it
but
we
could
see
from
the
outside
that
by
the
side
of
a
dim
lamp
three
persons
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
we
lay
down
of
the
edge
of
the
kanât
and
my
ears
eagerly
drank
in
the
words
which
fell
on
them
ajaib
said
a
voice
which
i
knew
at
once
to
be
cheetoo
and
so
he
murdered
the
khan
you
said
did
it
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
said
hidayut
khan
i
knew
his
voice
too
immediately
he
did
i
can
not
say
i
saw
him
die
with
my
own
eyes
but
they
made
him
drunk
and
they
buried
him
and
ameer
ali
himself
destroyed
the
noble
horse
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
cheetoo
with
a
sigh
i
have
done
his
memory
foul
wrong
in
thinking
him
ungrateful
and
the
others
they
were
men
of
scarcely
any
note
said
the
informer
nor
do
i
know
the
names
of
all
one
only
i
remember
for
they
had
hard
work
to
despatch
him
he
was
a
strong
man
by
name
hubeeb
oola
and
belonged
to
my
lord
own
pagah
i
knew
him
well
said
cheetoo
he
was
a
worthy
man
and
a
brave
one
and
ameer
ali
slew
him
he
did
nuwab
with
his
own
hands
and
motee
and
peer
khan
held
him
or
he
could
not
have
done
it
this
was
only
three
nights
ago
when
i
would
fain
have
denounced
them
but
i
feared
no
one
would
believe
me
and
as
i
knew
ameer
ali
was
in
your
favour
i
thought
no
one
would
have
listened
to
an
accusation
against
him
nor
would
i
by
alla
cried
cheetoo
rising
up
and
striking
his
forehead
in
extreme
agitation
i
had
made
a
hole
in
the
cloth
with
the
point
of
my
dagger
and
could
see
all
distinctly
i
would
never
have
believed
your
tale
but
that
circumstances
so
strongly
bear
out
what
you
have
said
who
could
have
believed
that
ameer
ali
the
kind
the
benevolent
one
who
opposed
every
scheme
of
violence
and
protested
against
our
ravages
till
i
was
ashamed
of
them
myself
who
could
have
thought
a
thug
but
it
is
the
truth
nuwab
said
the
vile
wretch
when
you
have
seized
them
you
will
find
ample
evidence
of
what
i
tell
you
the
sword
of
ghuffoor
khan
is
at
this
moment
girded
to
the
side
of
peer
khan
who
threw
away
his
own
that
will
be
conclusive
indeed
said
cheetoo
but
how
came
you
to
join
them
i
was
at
my
village
near
jhalone
said
hidayut
khan
i
had
formerly
known
peeroo
as
we
call
peer
khan
and
he
asked
me
to
join
him
and
his
jemadar
and
to
follow
the
pindharees
i
never
suspected
them
to
be
thugs
who
could
when
ameer
ali
and
his
father
were
high
in
favour
with
the
rajah
and
it
was
not
till
the
khan
death
that
they
began
their
horrible
work
well
said
cheetoo
you
have
laid
the
plan
the
sooner
you
put
it
into
execution
the
better
you
have
prepared
the
horsemen
have
you
not
said
he
to
the
other
man
whose
face
i
knew
i
have
he
replied
they
are
standing
by
their
horses
all
ready
for
the
signal
to
set
on
fifty
good
fellows
none
of
the
thugs
will
escape
us
ya
alla
cried
cheetoo
how
will
he
look
on
me
and
how
can
i
bring
myself
to
order
the
punishment
he
deserves
ah
ameer
ali
how
thou
hast
deceived
me
how
could
any
one
read
deceit
in
that
honest
face
of
thine
go
said
he
to
hidayut
khan
and
the
others
bring
them
to
me
without
delay
i
will
not
forget
thy
reward
thou
hast
for
the
saddle
of
peer
khan
no
more
no
more
cried
the
villain
is
all
i
want
ay
said
peer
khan
to
me
in
a
whisper
but
he
has
not
got
it
yet
and
he
is
a
cunning
fellow
if
he
does
get
it
come
meer
sahib
we
must
be
off
they
are
moving
i
was
almost
fascinated
to
the
spot
i
could
have
lain
there
and
listened
to
the
discourse
but
the
peril
was
too
imminent
too
deadly
for
a
moment
delay
i
got
up
and
sneaking
along
we
saw
the
two
figures
cross
the
threshold
of
the
tent
and
with
hurried
steps
direct
their
course
to
a
part
of
the
camp
where
the
pagah
was
and
which
was
close
to
our
tent
fear
lent
us
speed
we
flew
to
our
tent
and
for
a
few
moments
were
engaged
in
tying
up
some
valuables
we
had
brought
out
for
division
having
done
this
we
hurried
to
our
horses
some
of
the
men
were
already
in
their
saddles
i
leaped
on
my
spirited
animal
and
drew
my
sword
ready
for
the
worst
i
wished
all
to
move
off
in
a
body
for
as
yet
there
was
no
alarm
but
i
was
deceived
we
were
surrounded
the
instant
we
were
in
motion
a
body
of
horse
dashed
at
us
and
we
were
at
once
engaged
in
a
conflict
for
life
or
death
what
happened
i
know
not
i
cut
down
the
only
man
who
was
opposed
to
me
peer
khan
was
equally
fortunate
i
received
a
slight
wound
from
another
which
i
little
heeded
we
urged
our
horses
to
their
utmost
speed
and
the
darkness
favoured
our
escape
i
soon
found
as
i
slackened
my
pace
a
little
that
some
of
my
men
were
with
me
we
had
agreed
to
take
a
northerly
direction
and
rendezvous
near
a
small
village
which
could
be
seen
from
the
camp
and
by
this
precaution
those
who
had
escaped
were
soon
collected
together
we
were
not
pursued
though
we
heard
the
shouts
of
the
pindharees
as
they
hallooed
to
each
other
in
and
about
their
camp
and
the
shots
from
their
matchlocks
and
we
afterwards
heard
they
had
grievously
wounded
many
of
each
other
in
mistake
i
almost
dreaded
to
call
over
the
names
of
those
who
stood
around
me
for
i
could
not
see
their
faces
and
no
one
spoke
a
word
to
his
companion
we
waited
for
a
considerable
time
for
an
hour
or
more
gradually
the
noise
and
shouting
in
the
pindharee
camp
died
away
and
by
the
straggling
alone
could
one
have
told
that
a
mighty
army
was
encamped
there
now
and
then
the
shrill
neigh
of
a
horse
was
borne
to
us
upon
the
night
wind
and
when
it
ceased
there
was
again
a
melancholy
silence
the
little
village
too
was
deserted
part
of
it
had
been
burned
and
the
embers
of
the
houses
still
emitted
sparks
now
and
then
sending
up
a
flame
as
portions
of
dry
grass
of
the
thatched
huts
which
had
escaped
became
ignited
further
delay
was
useless
i
therefore
broke
the
silence
which
was
painful
to
all
how
many
are
there
of
us
peer
khan
i
asked
in
a
low
tone
eleven
said
he
the
rest
i
fear
have
fallen
i
pray
alla
they
have
better
far
to
fall
by
a
or
a
than
to
be
exposed
to
torture
but
who
are
absent
is
motee
here
alas
no
meer
sahib
motee
i
saw
struck
down
i
made
a
cut
at
the
pindharee
who
wounded
him
but
the
darkness
deceived
me
i
missed
him
and
who
else
are
absent
said
i
stifling
my
grief
for
motee
had
been
as
a
brother
to
me
let
those
who
are
here
tell
their
names
they
did
so
ghous
khan
was
away
and
nuzzur
ali
and
ramdeen
singh
three
of
our
best
men
motee
was
a
fourth
hidayut
khan
the
traitor
was
a
fifth
and
all
our
attendants
and
grooms
is
no
use
staying
here
said
i
we
must
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
jhalone
there
we
will
wait
the
usual
time
and
if
none
return
the
ceremonies
for
the
dead
must
be
performed
for
them
none
of
ye
will
grudge
your
share
of
the
booty
we
have
blessed
be
bhowanee
brought
away
with
us
to
their
wives
and
families
swear
this
unto
me
ye
that
are
willing
we
swear
cried
the
whole
almost
with
one
voice
i
am
satisfied
said
i
now
let
us
proceed
we
must
turn
off
the
main
road
when
it
is
light
we
all
know
the
paths
through
the
jungles
and
by
them
we
will
travel
till
we
are
safely
beyond
hussingabad
beyond
that
i
fear
not
proceed
cried
peer
khan
we
follow
you
and
we
rode
on
in
silence
with
heavy
hearts
we
travelled
thus
for
many
days
through
the
country
we
passed
we
represented
ourselves
as
long
as
the
nagpoor
territory
lasted
to
be
servants
of
the
government
on
a
secret
mission
and
though
we
were
often
suspected
and
questioned
yet
by
my
address
i
brought
my
band
clear
out
of
all
the
difficulties
and
our
hearts
bounded
with
joy
when
at
length
we
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
noble
nurbudda
and
dashing
our
steeds
into
the
ford
soon
left
its
waters
between
us
and
our
enemies
inured
as
we
were
to
the
fatigues
of
long
and
severe
marches
and
our
horses
also
not
a
day
passed
but
fifteen
or
twenty
coss
were
travelled
and
at
this
rate
we
were
not
long
in
reaching
our
home
blessed
be
alla
we
did
reach
it
and
glad
was
my
heart
once
again
to
see
the
groves
of
jhalone
after
my
weary
pilgrimage
no
notice
had
we
been
able
to
give
of
our
approach
and
i
alighted
at
the
door
of
my
own
house
unattended
and
alone
covered
with
dust
and
worn
by
fatigue
and
exposure
to
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sun
and
as
much
changed
by
anxiety
for
the
fate
of
my
poor
comrades
as
though
ten
additional
years
had
gone
over
my
head
instead
of
only
a
few
weeks
my
servants
scarcely
knew
me
but
when
i
was
recognised
the
glad
tidings
of
my
return
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
i
waited
not
even
to
quench
my
raging
thirst
before
i
was
again
in
the
embrace
of
azima
my
own
loved
one
and
peril
was
once
more
forgotten
we
assembled
in
the
evening
and
as
the
pockets
of
our
saddles
were
one
by
one
unripped
and
their
contents
heaped
on
the
floor
before
us
a
glorious
pile
indeed
met
our
view
of
lumps
of
gold
and
silver
the
produce
of
the
jewels
we
had
seized
which
we
had
melted
down
as
we
got
them
there
were
a
few
strings
of
pearls
one
of
which
i
laid
aside
for
the
rajah
and
the
whole
was
then
weighed
valued
and
distributed
those
whom
we
supposed
to
be
dead
were
not
forgotten
their
shares
were
laid
aside
and
afterwards
delivered
to
their
families
i
now
again
enjoyed
peace
and
rest
all
idea
of
joining
cheetoo
or
any
other
of
the
pindharee
leaders
was
out
of
the
question
for
though
i
might
have
done
so
under
an
assumed
name
yet
the
chance
of
being
recognised
would
have
been
too
great
and
i
was
rich
enough
for
the
present
cheetoo
too
had
reached
the
summit
of
his
fame
and
his
prosperity
his
plans
were
all
frustrated
by
the
rash
and
sudden
rise
of
the
mahratta
powers
all
they
could
do
was
of
no
avail
against
the
skill
and
bravery
of
the
europeans
one
by
one
they
were
conquered
and
cheetoo
though
he
might
have
profited
by
the
generosity
of
his
enemies
and
accepted
a
large
estate
which
he
was
offered
by
them
could
not
curb
his
restless
spirit
a
few
of
his
men
followed
his
fortunes
but
his
standard
was
in
vain
raised
for
fresh
adherents
these
even
deserted
him
one
by
one
his
prospects
were
blasted
he
became
a
miserable
fugitive
and
pursued
from
haunt
to
haunt
from
fastness
to
fastness
he
at
last
perished
miserably
by
a
tiger
in
the
dense
jungles
about
the
fort
of
asseer
ghur
peace
be
to
his
memory
he
was
a
great
man
and
a
skilful
and
brave
leader
and
whatever
crimes
he
may
have
committed
in
his
wild
career
as
a
pindharee
chieftain
his
dreadful
death
has
been
some
atonement
for
them
i
pass
over
two
more
years
why
should
i
fatigue
you
sahib
with
a
relation
of
daily
occurrences
monotonous
in
themselves
and
presenting
to
my
memory
not
one
incident
worthy
of
remark
i
will
again
lead
you
to
the
road
and
to
further
adventures
but
ameer
ali
said
i
did
you
never
hear
aught
of
motee
and
your
other
companions
who
were
seized
by
cheetoo
i
had
forgotten
them
sahib
theirs
was
a
sad
fate
as
you
shall
hear
one
evening
about
three
months
after
my
return
home
as
i
was
sitting
in
the
dewan
khana
of
my
house
surrounded
by
some
friends
an
attendant
brought
me
word
that
a
man
was
without
closely
wrapped
in
a
sheet
who
desired
to
speak
with
me
he
will
not
enter
said
he
and
says
that
you
will
know
him
when
you
see
him
i
took
up
my
sword
and
followed
him
it
was
dusk
and
i
did
not
recognise
the
features
of
the
person
who
had
sent
for
me
indeed
he
was
so
closely
muffled
that
i
could
hardly
see
them
what
is
your
purpose
friend
i
asked
as
the
man
did
not
speak
but
motioned
with
his
arms
under
his
cloth
for
my
attendant
to
go
away
i
bid
him
begone
jemadar
cried
the
figure
when
we
were
alone
do
you
not
know
me
the
voice
said
i
is
familiar
to
mine
ears
step
into
the
light
that
i
may
see
your
face
no
no
said
the
man
in
a
hollow
voice
i
can
not
bear
the
light
mutilated
and
disgraced
as
i
am
the
darkness
scarcely
hides
my
shame
i
am
ghous
khan
ghous
khan
i
cried
in
amazement
he
is
dead
he
perished
at
it
is
even
so
said
the
man
with
a
melancholy
voice
ghous
khan
is
before
you
to
prove
it
send
for
a
light
and
look
at
me
i
brought
one
myself
and
held
it
to
his
face
i
was
indeed
shocked
ghous
khan
before
me
but
oh
how
changed
his
features
were
worn
and
sunken
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
was
dimmed
his
beard
was
matted
and
uncombed
and
a
few
dirty
rags
covered
his
head
but
what
above
all
shocked
me
was
that
his
nose
had
been
cut
off
close
to
his
face
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
and
mouth
had
been
drawn
together
by
the
healed
wound
so
that
it
was
tight
over
them
and
imparted
to
his
features
a
ghastly
expression
my
poor
friend
i
exclaimed
embracing
him
how
is
this
how
have
you
been
reduced
to
this
condition
speak
for
the
love
of
alla
and
tell
me
what
you
have
suffered
the
disfigurement
of
my
face
is
not
all
meer
sahib
said
he
throwing
off
the
dirty
ragged
sheet
which
covered
him
behold
these
and
the
poor
fellow
held
up
to
my
view
the
stumps
of
his
arms
his
hands
had
both
been
cut
off
between
the
wrist
and
the
elbow
and
the
wounds
were
scarcely
healed
having
done
this
he
sunk
down
on
the
floor
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
shame
i
raised
him
up
and
comforted
him
as
well
as
i
could
i
ordered
a
bath
for
him
and
clean
apparel
had
his
wounds
dressed
by
a
skilful
barber
and
after
seeing
him
eat
or
rather
fed
with
a
hearty
meal
i
left
him
to
his
repose
i
need
not
tell
you
now
that
one
of
my
lost
companions
had
arrived
how
i
longed
to
hear
the
fate
of
the
rest
that
night
i
was
sleepless
and
restless
but
the
next
day
closeted
with
me
in
a
private
room
apart
from
observation
he
gave
me
the
following
account
of
his
adventures
and
sufferings
adventures
indeed
there
were
few
but
sufferings
many
you
of
course
remember
meer
sahib
said
he
that
fatal
night
when
just
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
making
off
with
our
booty
we
were
attacked
the
darkness
favoured
your
escape
but
on
the
first
onset
of
the
pindharee
horsemen
i
received
a
severe
spear
wound
in
the
back
which
threw
me
from
my
horse
i
was
seized
by
the
pindharees
bound
hand
and
foot
and
carried
to
the
tent
of
cheetoo
where
there
was
now
a
large
concourse
of
people
assembled
the
wound
in
my
back
was
staunched
and
bound
up
and
in
a
few
moments
afterwards
other
pindharees
entered
bearing
who
was
desperately
wounded
in
the
head
and
the
two
others
nuzzur
ali
and
ramdeen
singh
who
were
untouched
hidayut
khan
was
there
the
villain
and
traitor
and
his
triumphant
glance
quailed
under
mine
when
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
him
and
would
not
withdraw
them
silence
was
ordered
and
cheetoo
demanded
with
a
loud
voice
of
hidayut
khan
whether
he
knew
any
of
the
persons
before
him
do
nuwab
said
the
wretch
and
he
named
us
one
by
one
and
pointed
us
out
what
have
you
to
say
against
them
asked
the
chief
accuse
them
of
being
thugs
said
he
accuse
them
of
murder
of
the
murder
of
ghuffoor
khan
and
of
fourteen
other
good
pindharees
they
dare
not
deny
it
their
jemadar
as
he
is
called
said
cheetoo
he
can
speak
answer
to
this
but
poor
motee
spirit
was
fast
departing
he
was
senseless
and
never
spoke
afterwards
will
reply
said
i
say
it
is
a
lie
a
base
lie
i
defy
that
man
to
bring
proofs
have
we
not
served
well
in
your
camp
oh
nuwab
have
we
not
ever
been
foremost
in
danger
and
more
merciful
than
all
the
rest
of
these
murdering
villains
him
on
the
mouth
with
a
shoe
cut
him
down
for
his
insolence
cried
several
again
exclaimed
cheetoo
first
man
who
disturbs
this
inquiry
by
alla
i
will
behead
him
on
he
continued
addressing
me
more
have
you
to
say
nuwab
i
rely
on
your
justice
thou
shalt
have
but
tell
me
why
your
chief
has
fled
this
confused
me
a
little
but
after
a
moment
thought
i
replied
stoutly
you
nuwab
i
am
a
plain
soldier
and
can
not
please
your
ear
with
fine
words
my
leader
has
fled
it
is
true
but
not
from
guilt
that
villain
hidayut
khan
wanted
more
than
his
share
of
plunder
on
many
occasions
and
was
refused
it
he
separated
from
us
we
dogged
him
about
the
camp
and
detected
him
in
close
conversation
with
a
man
who
is
known
to
be
in
your
favour
this
excited
our
suspicion
this
evening
we
watched
him
to
your
tent
i
gave
the
information
to
our
jemadar
he
and
peer
khan
stole
towards
it
they
lay
down
outside
and
heard
his
vile
accusations
of
murder
and
had
only
time
to
fly
and
mount
their
horses
we
were
not
all
prepared
and
have
fallen
into
your
hands
of
what
use
would
it
have
been
for
him
to
have
braved
your
presence
the
disgrace
alone
to
such
a
man
as
he
is
would
have
been
insupportable
he
would
have
destroyed
himself
i
know
no
more
do
with
us
as
you
please
cheetoo
seemed
struck
with
what
i
had
said
and
mused
for
a
moment
proofs
of
their
guilt
cried
he
to
hidayut
khan
proofs
bring
them
or
it
will
be
worse
for
thee
their
swords
be
brought
said
he
khan
has
made
off
with
that
of
ghuffoor
khan
but
that
man
pointing
to
ramdeen
has
one
which
was
the
property
of
a
pindharee
who
was
murdered
two
nights
ago
and
other
articles
may
be
discovered
in
the
linings
of
their
saddles
me
the
swords
cried
a
pindharee
in
the
crowd
brother
disappeared
two
nights
ago
and
i
have
sought
him
in
vain
since
they
were
brought
ah
meer
sahib
how
can
i
tell
you
that
ramdeen
singh
was
instantly
recognised
by
the
pindharee
who
vehemently
demanded
our
blood
from
cheetoo
is
conclusive
against
you
said
cheetoo
can
you
say
ramdeen
muttered
a
few
words
in
exculpation
but
they
were
unheeded
beg
further
to
represent
cried
hidayut
khan
if
you
have
any
further
doubts
of
what
i
have
declared
to
be
the
fact
i
am
ready
to
accompany
any
men
you
may
choose
to
select
i
will
guide
them
to
the
spot
where
that
man
unfortunate
brother
lies
in
his
unblessed
grave
and
not
only
him
will
i
disinter
but
march
after
march
beyond
that
one
will
i
dig
up
at
one
place
one
body
at
another
two
until
we
come
to
where
ghuffoor
khan
and
his
unfortunate
saees
lie
both
in
the
same
hole
cheetoo
shuddered
is
too
true
said
he
my
brave
men
have
fallen
by
the
base
hands
of
these
stranglers
men
who
ought
to
have
purchased
their
martyrdom
by
death
on
the
where
are
the
saddles
and
their
contents
let
them
be
produced
this
was
worse
and
worse
nuzzur
ali
saddle
you
may
remember
was
old
and
worn
and
he
had
taken
that
of
the
pindharee
we
last
killed
the
brother
knew
it
and
wept
over
it
in
the
lining
was
all
the
plunder
he
had
got
just
as
we
had
received
it
and
around
my
own
waist
was
the
man
humeana
with
which
i
had
replaced
my
own
it
had
his
name
on
it
written
in
persian
which
i
had
not
observed
it
was
enough
we
were
convicted
i
repeated
the
belief
and
gave
myself
up
to
death
yet
i
once
more
uplifted
my
voice
i
exclaimed
is
of
no
use
to
contend
further
with
destiny
were
we
a
thousand
times
innocent
this
array
of
facts
against
us
would
convict
us
i
now
conceal
not
that
we
are
thugs
followers
of
the
blessed
bhowanee
who
will
receive
us
into
paradise
we
shall
die
by
your
command
but
why
should
that
vile
wretch
live
he
who
for
a
greedy
demand
of
more
than
his
share
which
he
knew
he
could
not
receive
according
to
our
laws
has
denounced
us
has
broken
his
oath
and
been
unfaithful
to
the
salt
he
has
eaten
is
he
not
a
thug
has
he
not
joined
me
and
a
hundred
others
in
our
work
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
he
can
not
deny
it
look
at
him
look
at
his
cowardly
features
convulsed
by
terror
show
that
what
i
say
is
true
if
he
had
been
as
he
says
he
is
an
honest
man
why
did
he
not
cause
us
to
be
seized
when
we
were
in
the
act
of
murder
upon
the
very
bodies
he
might
have
done
so
for
the
deeds
except
that
of
ghuffoor
khan
were
committed
in
the
first
watch
of
the
night
when
the
camp
was
awake
and
every
one
engaged
in
his
own
business
why
did
he
not
then
denounce
us
he
would
have
been
believed
but
no
he
wanted
half
of
the
plunder
of
that
man
brother
it
was
denied
him
as
similar
requests
had
been
before
and
he
has
become
a
thing
for
men
to
spit
at
if
we
die
he
should
not
be
spared
because
he
is
a
thug
as
we
are
because
he
is
a
traitor
and
a
coward
cried
hidayut
khan
scarcely
able
to
speak
between
rage
and
fear
i
defy
thee
to
say
i
ever
strangled
a
person
said
i
to
cheetoo
was
too
great
a
coward
he
dared
not
and
my
lord
may
have
remarked
that
he
used
the
slang
term
to
express
his
meaning
in
the
last
words
he
uttered
wretch
cried
cheetoo
to
him
art
worse
than
they
they
are
brave
and
undaunted
thou
art
a
coward
thy
head
shall
be
struck
from
thy
body
his
cries
for
pardon
for
life
were
horrible
he
besought
he
threatened
but
of
what
avail
was
it
he
was
dragged
to
the
doorway
of
the
tent
a
pindharee
stepped
behind
him
and
while
he
still
pleaded
for
mercy
his
head
was
struck
from
his
shoulders
and
rolled
forwards
you
not
dismayed
cried
cheetoo
to
us
will
follow
cried
we
one
and
all
must
come
sooner
or
later
and
ours
is
now
we
fear
not
fear
it
not
said
he
to
another
chieftain
would
be
welcome
to
them
but
their
punishment
shall
be
worse
they
shall
linger
out
a
miserable
existence
ho
cried
he
to
his
furashes
off
these
villains
noses
and
hands
and
bring
them
to
me
it
was
done
meer
sahib
i
alone
have
lived
to
tell
it
our
noses
were
cut
off
next
our
hands
the
bleeding
stumps
were
thrust
into
boiling
oil
and
we
were
driven
from
the
camp
there
and
then
to
perish
as
they
thought
we
should
in
the
wild
jungles
and
the
other
two
did
perish
we
had
no
one
to
bind
up
our
wounds
those
of
nuzzur
ali
and
ramdeen
broke
out
bleeding
several
days
afterwards
and
they
died
within
two
days
of
each
other
so
long
as
we
were
together
we
supported
ourselves
by
begging
in
the
villages
representing
ourselves
to
be
villagers
from
a
distant
country
whom
the
pindharees
had
brought
thus
far
and
mutilated
and
we
procured
enough
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
hunger
but
we
could
get
no
one
to
dress
our
wounds
which
were
inflamed
by
the
scorching
heat
of
the
weather
and
as
i
said
the
two
died
motee
we
never
saw
but
he
must
have
died
also
for
the
wound
in
his
head
had
cut
through
the
brain
and
he
never
spoke
his
was
a
happy
fate
compared
to
ours
i
have
wandered
from
place
to
place
proceeding
a
few
coss
a
day
i
have
been
fed
and
my
blessings
are
on
those
who
gave
me
food
for
the
sake
of
the
prophet
what
i
have
suffered
i
can
not
describe
but
i
am
now
with
you
again
and
your
kindness
has
obliterated
it
all
from
my
memory
i
will
live
and
die
with
you
if
you
will
grant
enough
to
feed
your
faithful
slave
who
will
now
be
only
a
burthen
to
you
i
was
deeply
affected
at
his
story
i
took
the
poor
fellow
under
my
care
and
his
wounds
were
healed
but
he
never
held
up
his
head
afterwards
he
died
before
the
year
was
ended
i
believe
of
shame
and
a
sense
of
his
helpless
condition
chapter
xxxix
three
years
as
i
have
before
told
you
sahib
passed
in
inactivity
my
father
and
myself
were
in
high
favour
at
least
so
we
thought
with
the
rajah
who
protected
us
and
bestowed
flattering
marks
of
kindness
upon
us
our
revenue
business
was
increased
we
had
now
the
management
of
a
large
tract
of
country
and
i
believe
we
gave
satisfaction
to
the
people
as
well
as
to
their
prince
the
revenue
was
never
in
arrears
and
many
persons
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
hearing
of
our
mild
and
equitable
mode
of
government
came
and
settled
with
us
in
our
villages
our
perquisites
as
revenue
collectors
yielded
a
handsome
income
and
we
lived
happy
and
tranquilly
still
a
restless
spirit
was
within
me
i
heard
of
the
successes
of
various
bands
of
thugs
in
different
directions
men
came
and
boasted
of
their
exploits
and
again
i
longed
to
be
at
the
head
of
my
gallant
fellows
and
to
roam
awhile
striking
terror
into
the
country
is
true
i
had
gained
the
highest
rank
i
could
i
possessed
fame
not
a
jemadar
or
soobehdar
of
thugs
could
compare
his
actions
with
mine
but
i
vainly
thought
that
there
was
more
to
be
gained
and
that
i
had
only
to
propose
an
expedition
to
be
joined
by
a
larger
number
of
thugs
than
had
collected
together
for
many
years
in
this
i
was
not
disappointed
as
you
shall
hear
i
have
before
mentioned
to
you
the
name
of
ganesha
jemadar
he
was
always
with
us
when
not
on
the
road
envying
our
quiet
and
respectable
mode
of
life
which
he
could
not
attain
by
any
means
though
he
left
none
untried
he
bribed
all
the
rajah
court
nay
the
rajah
himself
to
procure
employment
but
there
was
something
so
harsh
and
forbidding
in
his
aspect
and
so
uncouth
were
his
manners
that
he
did
not
succeed
in
what
he
so
much
longed
for
he
came
in
despair
to
us
and
after
rating
in
no
measured
terms
the
conduct
of
the
rajah
and
his
officers
said
that
he
was
determined
again
to
take
to
the
road
for
there
alone
he
found
occupation
and
amusement
he
pressed
me
to
accompany
and
join
him
pictured
in
strong
terms
the
booty
we
should
gain
and
the
glory
we
should
win
and
after
many
demurs
and
objections
on
my
part
i
finally
agreed
notice
was
given
out
to
all
the
thugs
of
that
part
of
the
country
that
an
expedition
of
great
magnitude
would
be
undertaken
after
the
ensuing
dussera
accustomed
as
azima
had
become
to
my
temporary
absences
after
the
period
of
quiet
i
had
passed
with
her
she
now
did
not
oppose
my
leaving
her
as
she
had
done
before
she
thought
it
was
some
mercantile
speculation
which
led
me
from
home
and
as
you
may
believe
i
did
not
undeceive
her
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
again
serving
under
me
all
my
own
band
and
many
more
flocked
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
which
was
at
some
distance
from
jhalone
ganesha
had
upwards
of
a
hundred
followers
and
finally
on
the
day
of
the
dussera
the
usual
ceremonies
were
concluded
in
the
presence
of
upwards
of
three
hundred
thugs
than
whom
a
finer
or
more
experienced
band
were
never
gathered
under
any
leader
i
was
justly
proud
of
my
charge
and
my
father
who
had
accompanied
me
to
the
rendezvous
felt
all
his
former
fire
kindle
within
him
i
pressed
him
to
accompany
us
and
the
old
man
consented
some
were
for
trying
a
new
line
of
road
and
for
penetrating
into
guzerat
through
rajpootana
this
question
was
fairly
discussed
in
a
general
assembly
and
opinions
being
much
balanced
between
that
route
and
our
old
one
by
saugor
and
jubbulpoor
to
nagpoor
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
decision
of
the
omens
they
were
consulted
as
i
have
before
described
and
as
they
decidedly
pointed
to
the
south
no
further
doubt
could
be
entertained
upon
the
subject
and
again
we
moved
on
in
our
old
direction
to
us
familiar
for
there
was
not
a
man
among
us
who
did
not
know
every
step
of
the
road
and
the
best
places
for
the
destruction
of
any
persons
whom
chance
might
throw
in
our
way
we
had
proceeded
nearly
as
far
as
saugor
with
but
indifferent
success
considering
our
large
body
having
only
killed
fourteen
travellers
and
got
but
little
booty
when
one
night
as
my
father
and
myself
with
a
few
others
sat
in
our
little
tent
we
heard
the
that
most
dreadful
of
all
omens
to
a
thug
the
ekarea
is
the
short
sharp
bark
or
call
of
the
jackal
uttered
in
the
first
watch
of
the
night
in
itself
there
is
something
peculiarly
melancholy
and
appalling
but
to
a
thug
the
sound
is
one
of
horror
in
an
instant
all
conversation
was
at
an
end
and
we
gazed
on
each
other
in
consternation
and
alarm
no
one
spoke
we
all
listened
intently
it
might
be
repeated
which
would
be
worse
than
ever
it
was
the
sharp
short
bark
was
again
heard
and
there
was
but
little
time
for
deliberation
all
started
to
their
feet
we
must
return
instantly
said
my
father
bhowanee
is
unpropitious
or
danger
threatens
at
any
rate
to
go
on
is
impossible
for
mark
you
not
that
the
sound
came
from
the
very
direction
of
march
all
agreed
that
it
did
and
were
unanimous
in
their
desire
to
return
still
i
could
not
divine
why
the
bark
of
a
jackal
should
change
the
determination
of
three
hundred
men
and
i
ventured
to
say
that
i
was
sure
it
was
some
mistake
and
that
even
if
it
were
not
we
ought
to
proceed
since
the
omens
had
been
so
propitious
at
the
commencement
why
said
i
to
my
father
were
they
not
so
have
we
not
worshipped
the
pickaxe
every
seventh
day
according
to
the
law
have
we
not
performed
all
the
necessary
ceremonies
on
the
death
of
every
traveller
that
is
all
true
said
my
father
but
it
is
madness
to
think
of
proceeding
foolish
boy
you
have
never
known
a
reverse
thanks
to
your
good
fortune
and
the
excellent
advice
by
which
you
have
been
guided
but
beware
how
you
disregard
omens
it
will
one
day
lead
you
to
destruction
as
to
this
matter
the
designs
of
bhowanee
are
inscrutable
and
she
must
be
obeyed
other
thugs
too
had
heard
the
ekarea
and
many
came
in
a
clamorous
body
to
the
tent
begging
either
to
be
allowed
to
disperse
or
to
be
led
back
to
jhalone
any
words
of
mine
would
have
been
useless
for
the
whole
band
seemed
infected
by
superstitious
fear
i
therefore
held
my
peace
our
encampment
was
broken
up
instantly
and
late
as
it
was
we
that
night
retrograded
a
few
coss
on
the
road
by
which
we
had
come
no
fresh
omen
of
favour
was
vouchsafed
to
us
and
we
retraced
our
steps
to
jhalone
disappointed
wearied
and
dispirited
a
month
passed
in
idleness
but
having
formed
my
determination
again
to
take
to
the
road
i
was
not
to
be
put
off
and
again
i
assembled
my
men
and
sought
for
omens
they
were
favourable
and
i
heartily
prayed
to
bhowanee
that
they
might
not
deceive
us
again
into
a
fruitless
expedition
they
pointed
too
to
a
different
direction
that
of
the
west
and
we
knew
that
between
bombay
and
indoor
and
indeed
through
all
parts
of
malwa
large
treasures
were
constantly
passing
we
had
before
as
you
have
heard
reaped
the
largest
booty
i
had
ever
got
in
that
quarter
and
i
hoped
to
secure
a
like
one
again
we
accordingly
left
our
home
one
hundred
and
twenty
thugs
under
myself
and
peer
khan
who
still
stuck
to
me
ganesha
had
gone
off
in
a
different
direction
whither
i
knew
not
his
presence
was
always
hateful
to
me
why
i
could
not
tell
and
i
could
but
ill
disguise
the
feelings
i
entertained
towards
him
it
was
too
long
an
expedition
for
my
father
to
undertake
and
accordingly
he
stayed
at
our
village
we
met
with
no
adventures
worth
recording
sahib
on
our
road
to
bombay
for
thither
we
were
determined
to
proceed
in
quest
of
plunder
besides
i
had
heard
much
of
its
importance
and
i
felt
a
curiosity
to
behold
the
sea
and
the
ships
of
the
feringhees
which
came
over
trackless
waters
from
their
far
country
but
when
i
say
that
we
met
with
no
particular
adventures
or
any
worth
recording
you
must
not
think
that
we
were
idle
travellers
died
by
our
hands
several
escaped
us
the
omens
being
against
their
destruction
and
finally
we
reached
bombay
with
about
four
thousand
rupees
worth
of
plunder
enough
to
enable
us
to
live
respectably
in
bombay
we
put
up
in
the
large
bazar
which
is
without
the
fort
and
although
from
the
danger
of
detection
we
could
not
keep
together
yet
a
constant
communication
was
kept
up
among
us
and
every
man
held
himself
in
readiness
to
start
in
any
direction
on
a
warning
i
had
appointed
too
a
rendezvous
the
town
of
tannah
which
being
close
to
the
continent
is
a
place
where
travellers
congregate
in
large
numbers
previous
to
passing
over
i
saw
the
sea
day
after
day
i
went
down
to
its
edge
and
gazed
on
its
magnificence
i
used
to
lie
on
the
grass
of
the
plain
before
the
fort
and
pass
hours
of
a
sort
of
dreamy
ecstasy
looking
on
its
varying
aspect
like
that
of
a
beautiful
woman
now
all
smiles
and
again
agitated
by
the
passions
of
love
or
listening
to
its
monotonous
and
sullen
roar
as
wave
after
wave
bowed
its
crest
and
broke
into
sparkling
foam
on
the
white
sand
i
was
lying
thus
one
day
about
the
seventh
after
our
arrival
meditating
on
our
inactive
life
and
had
almost
determined
to
depart
the
next
day
when
a
man
came
up
to
me
salam
aliekoom
said
he
you
are
evidently
a
stranger
for
your
dress
and
carriage
bespeak
you
to
be
an
inhabitant
of
hindostan
i
have
watched
you
for
two
days
coming
to
this
spot
and
gazing
on
the
sea
have
you
never
seen
it
before
never
replied
i
my
home
is
as
you
say
far
inland
and
in
hindostan
you
have
thus
guessed
rightly
and
to
me
a
stranger
can
it
be
otherwise
than
that
i
should
be
struck
with
a
sight
so
novel
and
so
overpowering
as
this
expanse
of
water
is
which
seems
to
melt
into
the
sky
the
tones
of
your
voice
are
music
in
my
ears
said
the
stranger
i
have
heard
many
from
my
country
for
that
is
also
hindostan
but
never
any
which
reminded
me
so
strongly
of
my
own
home
as
yours
may
i
ask
your
village
i
lived
formerly
in
murnae
in
the
sindousé
pergunna
said
i
but
now
reside
in
jhalone
murnae
cried
the
man
in
astonishment
but
he
lowered
his
voice
as
he
said
ah
i
remember
now
is
on
the
borders
of
sindia
country
and
belongs
to
him
not
now
said
i
the
feringhees
have
had
it
ceded
to
them
and
they
possess
it
but
said
the
man
changing
the
topic
you
love
to
look
on
the
sea
have
you
ever
been
on
its
surface
have
you
visited
the
ships
you
may
have
seen
moored
before
the
town
i
have
not
replied
i
i
several
times
determined
to
go
but
my
heart
failed
me
when
i
saw
the
frail
boat
which
should
take
me
besides
i
am
a
stranger
no
one
would
have
admitted
me
were
i
to
have
gone
to
them
will
you
accompany
me
said
the
man
i
have
an
idle
day
before
me
and
shall
be
glad
to
pass
it
in
your
company
i
gladly
assented
and
we
took
our
way
to
a
stone
pier
which
ran
into
the
sea
on
the
outside
of
the
fort
i
could
not
divine
with
whom
i
had
thus
scraped
an
acquaintance
all
the
peons
on
the
bunder
for
so
the
pier
was
called
paid
the
greatest
respect
to
my
new
friend
all
made
low
obeisances
to
him
and
a
scramble
ensued
among
the
owners
of
the
small
boats
which
were
tied
to
the
for
the
honour
of
conveying
us
to
the
shipping
he
selected
one
however
and
pushing
off
we
were
on
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
i
confess
i
was
afraid
though
jhalone
was
not
far
from
the
jumna
i
had
never
seen
that
river
nor
had
i
ever
seen
a
boat
before
my
arrival
at
bombay
now
each
succeeding
wave
as
we
descended
from
the
top
of
the
last
one
appeared
as
though
it
would
roll
over
us
but
the
men
were
fearless
and
experienced
and
after
a
few
qualms
i
was
reconciled
to
our
situation
we
rowed
for
the
wind
was
against
us
close
round
several
of
the
ships
which
lay
at
anchor
and
at
last
ascended
with
the
permission
of
a
feringhee
officer
who
was
on
board
the
side
of
an
immense
ship
which
my
friend
told
me
was
one
of
war
and
belonged
to
the
king
of
england
after
looking
over
the
upper
part
a
small
gratuity
of
two
rupees
to
a
sailor
enabled
us
to
proceed
below
to
see
the
guns
i
was
astonished
at
their
size
and
at
the
exactness
with
which
everything
was
fitted
the
ropes
even
were
twisted
down
into
coils
like
huge
snakes
sleeping
and
the
whole
was
a
picture
of
neatness
and
cleanliness
which
i
little
expected
to
have
seen
but
these
matters
sahib
are
doubtless
familiar
to
you
so
i
will
pass
them
over
we
returned
to
the
shore
with
a
fair
wind
and
as
the
boatmen
spread
a
small
sail
we
danced
merrily
along
over
the
swelling
waters
i
was
about
to
separate
from
my
companion
and
again
protested
my
sense
of
his
kindness
when
he
stopped
me
no
meer
sahib
said
he
i
must
have
further
converse
with
you
i
am
much
mistaken
if
you
are
not
what
i
was
once
and
am
still
whenever
i
can
seize
an
opportunity
i
stared
at
him
could
he
be
a
thug
if
he
was
not
he
would
not
understand
our
words
of
recognition
if
he
was
i
should
be
right
i
did
not
hesitate
ali
khan
bhaee
salam
said
i
gazing
intently
at
him
salam
aliekoom
cried
he
it
was
enough
he
also
was
a
thug
those
words
i
have
not
heard
for
many
a
year
said
he
they
remind
me
of
my
early
days
and
the
goor
of
the
tupounee
then
you
have
eaten
it
said
i
i
have
replied
the
man
enough
cried
i
i
have
met
with
a
friend
but
who
you
are
i
am
as
yet
ignorant
have
you
not
ever
heard
of
soobhan
khan
jemadar
he
asked
you
say
you
came
from
murnae
surely
i
must
be
remembered
there
i
have
answered
i
those
who
knew
you
have
believed
you
dead
how
is
it
that
you
are
here
and
a
person
of
authority
i
will
tell
you
hereafter
of
my
situation
but
at
present
i
have
many
questions
to
ask
of
you
and
first
is
my
good
friend
ismail
jemadar
alive
my
father
said
i
surely
he
is
the
good
old
man
has
attained
a
fine
age
and
is
well
shookur
khoda
cried
he
but
you
said
he
was
your
father
surely
he
had
no
children
he
was
not
even
married
when
i
left
ah
said
i
so
it
might
have
been
then
but
here
am
i
to
speak
for
myself
and
hoosein
his
and
my
friend
does
he
too
live
alas
no
he
died
two
years
ago
full
of
age
and
honour
i
have
not
mentioned
this
event
to
you
sahib
but
it
had
taken
place
soon
after
i
returned
from
my
pindharee
expedition
he
continued
to
ask
after
many
of
his
old
friends
and
at
last
inquired
how
many
men
i
had
with
me
i
told
him
and
he
was
somewhat
astonished
at
their
number
well
said
he
you
are
here
and
it
will
be
hard
if
i
can
not
find
some
work
for
you
i
have
told
you
i
am
a
thug
and
have
been
so
from
my
youth
my
father
and
ancestors
were
thugs
before
me
but
many
years
ago
i
came
here
as
the
servant
to
a
sahoukar
of
indoor
i
liked
the
place
and
not
long
after
got
employment
as
a
government
peon
in
the
service
of
the
english
they
have
been
kind
and
generous
masters
to
me
i
have
served
them
well
and
have
risen
by
degrees
to
the
rank
i
now
hold
which
is
that
of
jemadar
why
i
left
my
station
as
a
jemadar
of
thugs
is
perhaps
unknown
to
you
i
replied
that
i
did
not
know
it
was
in
consequence
of
a
foolish
quarrel
with
your
father
said
he
we
were
on
an
expedition
and
i
thought
he
assumed
too
much
we
were
both
young
men
of
fiery
blood
we
had
a
sharp
altercation
and
both
drew
our
swords
he
was
my
superior
and
i
feared
that
he
would
condemn
me
to
death
i
fled
entered
the
service
of
the
sahoukar
as
one
of
his
escort
from
indoor
and
you
see
what
i
am
yet
i
have
never
forsaken
the
thugs
whenever
i
have
met
with
them
i
am
too
old
to
seek
adventures
myself
but
i
put
the
young
and
active
in
the
way
of
them
and
thus
have
kept
up
my
connexion
with
them
not
it
is
true
with
those
of
hindostan
for
a
feeling
of
shame
has
hitherto
prevented
my
doing
so
but
since
bhowanee
has
thrown
you
in
my
way
you
shall
not
regret
it
my
acquaintance
has
been
with
the
thugs
of
the
dukhun
and
i
have
headed
one
or
two
expeditions
towards
poona
when
i
could
get
leave
of
absence
for
a
while
from
my
duties
but
when
i
could
not
do
this
i
have
secured
bands
of
travellers
for
my
associates
and
they
have
been
successful
i
have
too
by
the
share
of
the
booty
i
was
entitled
to
been
able
to
purchase
the
goodwill
of
those
who
could
befriend
me
and
your
servant
soobhan
khan
enjoys
a
high
character
among
the
for
honesty
and
fidelity
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
i
your
appearance
insures
respect
your
manners
are
courtly
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
thus
conversing
we
reached
his
house
it
was
not
far
from
where
i
was
residing
and
as
he
told
me
afterwards
he
had
discovered
who
we
were
and
had
followed
me
from
place
to
place
until
he
got
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
me
unobserved
from
this
time
as
you
may
believe
sahib
we
were
sworn
friends
i
listened
to
his
details
of
roguery
for
rogue
he
was
in
his
heart
with
great
interest
and
i
accompanied
him
several
times
to
the
durbar
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
his
duties
were
connected
he
was
evidently
a
person
well
thought
of
and
as
far
as
his
office
was
concerned
that
of
keeping
the
peace
was
zealous
and
active
still
there
was
something
forbidding
to
me
in
the
way
he
now
followed
his
profession
of
a
thug
and
as
we
became
more
intimately
acquainted
he
unfolded
to
me
his
plans
and
operations
i
can
not
tell
you
sahib
of
their
extent
he
introduced
me
to
the
jemadars
of
dukhun
thugs
who
scoured
the
roads
to
poona
to
nassuk
to
sholapoor
and
hyderabad
to
others
from
guzerat
who
were
engaged
in
that
part
of
the
country
but
all
under
his
control
and
from
all
of
whom
he
exacted
a
high
rate
of
tribute
as
the
price
of
the
information
he
was
able
to
give
them
as
to
the
despatch
of
treasure
in
various
directions
by
the
sahoukars
and
merchants
of
bombay
i
had
remained
with
him
a
week
and
our
stock
of
money
was
sensibly
diminishing
what
was
to
be
done
he
had
promised
assistance
in
giving
me
information
of
the
despatch
of
treasure
in
our
direction
and
i
had
hitherto
waited
in
expectation
that
he
would
fulfil
his
promise
i
was
tired
too
of
bombay
the
season
was
advancing
and
i
hardly
thought
we
should
reach
jhalone
before
the
setting
in
of
the
rains
i
therefore
went
to
him
and
frankly
told
him
our
money
was
running
short
and
that
in
a
place
like
bombay
where
my
men
were
exposed
to
so
many
temptations
they
could
not
be
expected
to
keep
what
they
had
i
was
therefore
anxious
to
depart
and
if
he
could
give
me
no
hope
of
any
speedy
booty
that
i
should
set
off
in
two
days
and
take
my
chance
on
the
road
my
plans
are
not
quite
matured
in
your
direction
said
he
i
have
heard
that
one
of
the
greatest
traders
to
indoor
and
malwa
is
about
to
send
not
less
than
two
lakhs
of
rupees
thither
i
know
that
the
rokurreas
are
hired
but
as
yet
i
can
not
say
whether
they
carry
hoondees
or
money
three
days
ought
to
determine
this
and
in
the
mean
time
as
you
want
money
a
thousand
rupees
are
at
your
service
which
you
can
repay
me
with
interest
at
three
per
cent
per
month
on
your
arrival
at
jhalone
i
will
trust
to
your
good
faith
as
the
son
of
my
old
friend
i
am
obliged
to
you
replied
i
but
the
money
is
not
quite
so
necessary
as
i
said
i
believe
every
man
has
some
twenty
or
thirty
rupees
in
his
possession
but
it
was
to
prevent
their
spending
this
that
i
spoke
to
you
as
i
did
only
say
that
within
a
week
we
may
start
and
my
men
will
be
careful
certainly
said
he
before
a
week
time
come
to
me
evening
after
and
you
shall
have
further
news
about
your
bunij
the
rascal
said
i
as
i
left
him
he
a
true
believer
strange
i
have
never
heard
of
him
from
my
father
but
i
will
ask
him
about
the
fellow
on
my
return
home
and
doubt
not
i
shall
hear
some
evil
or
rascality
of
him
not
a
rupee
of
his
money
will
i
touch
the
kafir
a
thug
to
take
interest
from
a
thug
who
ever
heard
of
it
i
dare
say
he
is
as
bad
as
the
villanous
bhutteara
we
killed
at
saugor
nor
was
i
wrong
sahib
i
became
intimate
with
a
dukhun
jemadar
who
was
waiting
for
bunij
who
told
me
that
he
ground
the
thugs
unmercifully
threatened
to
denounce
them
if
they
ever
demurred
and
got
from
them
double
the
share
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
had
he
shared
the
risk
and
the
danger
on
the
road
but
said
the
jemadar
there
is
no
doing
without
him
much
as
he
oppresses
us
he
throws
the
most
valuable
booty
into
our
hands
which
we
never
could
get
scent
of
by
ourselves
he
has
a
number
of
thugs
who
are
his
servants
and
whom
he
pays
liberally
to
get
him
information
he
possesses
the
confidence
of
the
sahoukars
as
he
assists
them
to
smuggle
they
pay
him
too
for
a
kind
word
now
and
then
with
the
in
fine
he
is
paid
both
by
them
and
us
and
he
contrives
to
sell
all
our
valuable
plunder
then
his
receipts
must
be
enormous
said
i
they
are
said
the
jemadar
and
we
all
grudge
them
to
him
but
still
he
protects
us
and
we
could
not
do
without
him
has
he
ever
been
treacherous
i
asked
for
by
alla
i
was
inclined
to
mistrust
the
rascal
there
are
some
stories
of
the
kind
he
replied
but
in
the
main
he
is
to
be
trusted
still
as
i
said
if
he
were
not
we
could
do
nothing
without
him
he
knows
every
jemadar
of
the
dukhun
and
could
if
he
chose
blow
up
the
whole
system
but
it
does
not
suit
his
interest
to
do
so
and
we
are
all
his
slaves
long
may
ye
continue
to
be
so
cried
i
to
peer
khan
when
he
had
left
me
but
as
for
us
brother
is
the
last
time
he
will
catch
us
here
what
say
you
certainly
said
peer
khan
these
fellows
are
never
to
be
trusted
they
exist
everywhere
in
all
shapes
they
are
zemindars
and
potails
of
villages
they
are
fakeers
and
bhuttearas
they
are
goosaens
sahoukars
servants
and
mutsuddees
nay
the
rajah
of
jhalone
is
one
himself
they
are
an
evil
is
true
but
we
could
not
do
without
them
i
have
done
so
as
yet
said
i
and
by
alla
i
will
never
trust
one
of
them
may
you
never
have
occasion
meer
sahib
and
the
conversation
dropped
i
went
as
i
had
promised
and
found
soobhan
khan
in
high
glee
i
have
secured
the
bunij
said
he
are
you
ready
i
am
what
are
your
orders
listen
he
replied
i
was
right
in
saying
the
sum
was
two
lakhs
contrary
to
my
expectations
the
sum
is
in
gold
and
silver
and
jewels
there
are
about
ten
thousand
rupees
in
hoondees
bills
but
that
is
all
now
before
i
tell
you
more
we
must
make
our
bargain
speak
cried
i
i
am
ready
to
give
anything
in
reason
ay
you
are
my
old
friend
son
so
i
must
not
treat
you
as
i
do
the
others
i
associate
with
said
he
from
them
i
get
a
third
of
the
whole
but
from
you
i
ask
only
a
fifth
a
fifth
will
be
twenty
thousand
rupees
will
you
give
it
with
pleasure
said
i
you
may
trust
to
my
word
directly
i
get
the
money
and
reach
jhalone
i
will
purchase
a
hoondee
on
bombay
and
send
it
you
capital
cried
he
you
are
a
man
i
like
to
deal
with
no
unnecessary
talk
no
haggling
like
a
bunnea
but
you
speak
like
a
soldier
as
you
are
now
give
me
a
promise
under
your
seal
that
i
shall
have
the
money
and
i
will
detail
the
plan
to
you
the
paper
is
a
mere
matter
of
form
and
i
am
methodical
i
objected
to
this
and
his
brow
darkened
i
saw
it
and
instantly
altered
what
i
had
expressed
get
me
writing
materials
and
i
will
write
it
out
what
you
write
a
thug
write
but
never
mind
since
you
are
able
to
do
it
so
much
the
better
there
will
be
no
need
of
a
third
person
i
wrote
the
paper
and
handed
it
to
him
having
sealed
it
with
my
seal
he
folded
it
carefully
up
and
tucked
it
into
a
fold
of
his
turban
now
we
are
all
right
meer
sahib
this
treasure
goes
under
the
escort
of
fifteen
rokurreas
they
have
three
camels
and
will
be
disguised
as
soldiers
going
from
poona
to
indoor
they
left
this
place
yesterday
with
part
of
the
treasure
the
rest
is
at
poona
from
poona
they
will
go
to
nassuk
where
you
will
fall
in
with
them
trust
me
my
information
is
correct
to
the
minutest
particular
i
know
the
sahoukars
who
send
it
i
have
spoken
with
the
rokurreas
and
to
ensure
your
being
unsuspected
by
them
here
is
a
pass
written
in
persian
and
mahratta
signed
and
sealed
by
the
english
officers
of
customs
here
it
represents
you
as
persons
who
have
come
from
benares
in
charge
of
goods
for
a
sahoukar
by
name
and
directs
that
no
one
shall
molest
you
on
your
return
the
men
who
brought
the
goods
are
still
here
and
likely
to
remain
till
the
end
of
the
rains
their
leader
name
is
futih
mahomed
so
futih
mahomed
you
must
be
if
you
please
he
too
is
about
your
own
age
and
appearance
and
thus
you
will
be
better
able
to
personate
him
you
see
i
have
laid
a
good
plan
and
i
leave
all
the
rest
to
your
own
judgment
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
nassuk
wait
there
four
days
and
on
the
fifth
you
will
see
your
bunij
if
you
keep
a
proper
look
out
now
go
make
your
preparations
and
may
bhowanee
send
you
success
remember
soobhan
khan
and
return
as
speedily
as
you
like
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
have
found
fresh
work
for
you
you
may
depend
on
me
khan
sahib
said
i
i
will
not
be
long
away
from
you
your
plan
is
an
admirable
one
and
inshalla
your
twenty
thousand
rupees
are
as
safe
to
you
as
though
you
even
now
had
them
in
your
possession
remember
me
with
many
kind
words
to
your
father
ameer
ali
continued
he
would
he
come
thus
far
to
see
an
old
friend
and
forgive
him
for
the
past
of
that
i
have
but
little
hope
said
i
he
is
old
and
infirm
and
never
leaves
his
village
but
he
shall
write
to
you
enough
enough
said
the
khan
i
have
much
to
accuse
myself
of
in
the
past
but
is
a
long
time
ago
and
he
has
most
likely
forgotten
my
foolish
conduct
i
left
him
but
made
an
inward
determination
to
be
guided
entirely
by
my
father
counsel
as
to
whether
one
cowree
of
the
twenty
thousand
rupees
should
be
paid
or
not
and
said
peer
khan
afterwards
twenty
thousand
rupees
the
old
villain
get
it
ah
meer
sahib
we
shall
be
the
brothers
of
owls
and
jackasses
if
he
ever
sees
one
rupee
the
next
morning
we
were
on
our
return
to
jhalone
and
we
halted
between
bombay
and
tannah
for
the
day
our
pass
was
of
much
use
for
it
was
respected
and
obeyed
and
the
day
after
we
passed
tannah
and
the
different
revenue
without
interruption
chapter
xl
shookur
khoda
cried
peer
khan
as
he
rushed
into
my
presence
on
the
fourth
day
after
we
had
arrived
at
nassuk
soobhan
khan
was
right
they
are
come
are
you
sure
khan
certain
he
replied
the
description
we
had
of
them
tallies
with
what
i
have
seen
in
every
point
come
and
see
yourself
there
are
the
camels
and
the
men
disguised
but
i
could
have
sworn
had
i
met
them
anywhere
that
they
were
rokurreas
they
have
the
air
and
bearing
of
the
tribe
enough
said
i
can
not
be
deceived
they
do
not
know
we
are
here
and
we
will
do
the
same
as
we
did
at
boorhanpoor
get
the
men
ready
we
will
go
round
the
town
travel
a
coss
or
two
and
enter
by
the
same
gate
they
did
we
will
then
put
up
in
the
bazar
with
them
we
were
all
shortly
in
motion
and
as
i
had
planned
after
going
round
the
outside
of
the
town
we
entered
it
on
the
other
side
and
were
soon
in
our
new
quarters
in
the
bazar
travellers
soon
get
acquainted
the
shop
i
chose
adjoined
the
one
they
occupied
and
i
had
quickly
scraped
an
acquaintance
with
the
jemadar
of
the
rokurreas
narrayun
das
for
that
was
his
name
was
a
tall
and
very
powerful
man
he
had
small
twinkling
eyes
and
long
straight
eyebrows
which
by
binding
his
turban
tightly
over
his
temples
he
had
drawn
up
in
diagonal
lines
to
either
side
and
this
imparted
to
them
a
very
peculiar
expression
long
mustachios
which
were
twisted
out
to
each
side
and
thick
bushy
whiskers
and
his
whole
appearance
proved
him
to
be
an
experienced
rokurrea
and
one
to
whom
deceit
and
stratagem
were
familiar
i
shall
have
a
cunning
hand
to
deal
with
here
thought
i
as
i
scanned
his
features
no
common
pretences
will
go
down
with
him
but
have
him
i
must
and
will
ay
and
his
two
lakhs
too
two
lakhs
it
is
worth
an
effort
were
he
roostum
himself
yet
he
was
not
slow
in
forming
an
acquaintance
with
me
our
salutations
passed
in
due
form
and
after
we
had
all
cooked
our
morning
meal
and
sat
on
our
carpets
we
soon
entered
into
familiar
conversation
a
pretty
business
bajee
rao
has
made
of
it
said
he
as
i
had
asked
him
the
news
from
poona
the
coward
had
he
but
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
army
when
the
fight
took
place
at
kirkee
he
might
have
annihilated
the
feringhees
and
do
you
wish
that
he
had
said
i
certainly
what
do
we
know
of
them
while
they
confined
themselves
to
the
fort
of
bombay
it
was
all
very
well
and
i
remember
the
time
when
they
had
hardly
a
foot
of
ground
beyond
it
but
now
little
by
little
they
have
advanced
until
they
have
upset
the
mahratta
empire
and
are
in
a
fair
way
to
take
it
but
said
i
bajee
rao
has
a
good
army
all
the
country
is
his
own
and
surely
he
will
do
something
the
mahrattas
are
good
soldiers
and
he
has
leaders
of
renown
with
him
he
will
do
nothing
meer
sahib
he
will
run
from
place
to
place
and
his
army
may
fight
if
they
can
or
will
he
will
never
draw
a
sword
the
cowardly
wretch
has
not
the
soul
of
a
flea
well
jemadar
to
me
it
matters
little
i
have
forsworn
soldiering
and
find
that
i
can
get
a
good
livelihood
by
escorting
treasure
and
goods
i
am
just
come
from
benares
and
the
sahoukar
who
employed
me
has
sent
for
more
which
i
am
to
bring
down
to
him
ah
cried
he
so
you
are
in
that
line
well
it
is
a
good
one
if
you
have
plenty
of
men
but
a
sorely
troublesome
and
difficult
one
if
you
have
few
i
speak
from
experience
for
i
am
in
the
same
business
myself
i
have
been
lucky
but
my
poor
brother
was
otherwise
he
fell
by
the
hands
of
thieves
between
here
and
indoor
we
heard
of
him
from
boorhanpoor
but
beyond
that
we
could
get
no
tidings
of
him
strange
said
i
i
never
heard
of
thieves
on
the
road
though
my
kafila
would
have
been
worth
plundering
but
now
i
am
under
the
protection
of
the
i
care
not
they
will
soon
have
all
the
country
and
there
will
be
no
danger
in
another
year
under
the
protection
of
the
feringhees
how
do
you
mean
i
thought
you
said
you
served
a
sahoukar
so
i
do
i
replied
but
to
ensure
my
safe
return
his
friend
soobhan
khan
got
me
this
pass
which
he
said
would
be
respected
throughout
the
country
and
i
pulled
out
the
document
which
i
had
carefully
folded
up
in
and
showed
it
to
him
you
are
fortunate
meer
sahib
and
particularly
in
knowing
soobhan
khan
who
is
a
worthy
man
and
one
deservedly
respected
i
have
known
him
for
many
years
he
has
always
been
a
good
friend
to
me
and
has
got
me
employment
when
i
most
required
it
by
becoming
security
for
me
to
a
large
amount
but
you
said
that
you
had
given
up
soldiering
in
this
you
have
been
wise
far
preferable
is
it
to
gain
an
honourable
livelihood
than
be
marched
in
all
directions
with
but
little
pay
and
hard
fighting
for
that
with
whom
have
you
served
you
must
not
tell
any
one
said
i
for
every
man
who
has
served
the
man
i
have
would
desire
it
to
be
a
secret
and
perhaps
the
knowledge
of
my
former
life
might
be
against
my
present
interests
i
served
under
cheetoo
pindharee
and
led
three
thousand
of
his
best
horse
under
cheetoo
cried
the
jemadar
this
is
most
strange
and
you
are
not
joking
i
am
not
i
swear
by
your
head
i
dare
say
i
could
find
some
papers
to
convince
you
of
the
fact
if
you
doubt
it
but
as
i
said
i
do
not
like
to
tell
any
one
you
need
not
fear
me
said
he
i
am
as
close
as
a
rokurrea
and
you
know
the
saying
is
proverbial
but
you
must
have
seen
strange
adventures
and
strange
lands
for
they
say
he
got
nearly
to
madras
and
left
the
feringhees
country
a
desert
behind
him
i
shall
be
glad
to
tell
you
some
of
my
adventures
jemadar
sahib
and
perhaps
they
may
interest
you
though
it
hardly
befits
a
man
to
speak
of
his
own
deeds
nay
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
meer
sahib
and
as
for
being
a
pindharee
the
best
in
the
land
were
with
him
and
a
gallant
army
they
were
when
the
first
lubhur
assembled
at
nemawur
then
you
were
there
i
was
i
brought
some
treasure
from
indoor
and
oojein
to
the
sahoukars
at
nemawur
and
saw
the
whole
of
the
preparations
for
the
campaign
and
bhugwan
knows
i
was
so
taken
with
the
appearance
of
the
whole
that
could
i
have
got
a
horse
i
verily
believe
i
should
have
turned
pindharee
myself
they
say
every
man
filled
his
saddle
with
gold
and
pearls
we
were
lucky
enough
said
i
especially
in
the
first
expedition
had
you
come
to
nemawur
before
the
second
had
set
out
you
would
have
heard
of
me
i
had
a
good
name
and
a
high
rank
in
the
first
i
was
nobody
and
gained
cheetoo
favour
solely
because
i
was
a
better
swordsman
than
any
in
his
camp
then
i
have
heard
of
you
said
the
man
but
surely
you
can
not
be
that
syud
ameer
ali
who
was
only
second
to
ghuffoor
khan
i
am
the
very
person
and
no
other
i
replied
true
my
rank
is
fallen
but
whose
has
not
cheetoo
is
dead
ghuffoor
khan
has
disappeared
and
is
supposed
to
have
gone
to
hyderabad
syud
bheekoo
is
god
knows
where
and
shekh
dulla
still
roams
about
the
hills
between
boorhanpoor
and
ellichpoor
with
a
price
set
on
his
head
no
one
knew
much
of
me
and
i
suspect
so
long
as
i
behave
peacefully
and
follow
my
present
calling
no
one
will
ask
after
me
i
had
enough
of
being
a
pindharee
after
the
second
foray
and
got
to
my
home
at
jhalone
as
soon
as
i
could
if
the
others
had
been
wise
they
would
have
sought
their
safety
as
i
did
yes
said
the
jemadar
cheetoo
was
a
sad
fate
he
deserved
a
better
but
they
say
the
offered
him
a
jagheer
is
this
true
so
i
have
heard
said
i
fool
that
he
was
he
would
not
accept
it
but
no
wonder
his
whole
soul
was
bound
up
in
his
plans
for
driving
out
the
feringhees
he
thought
the
mahrattas
would
beat
them
and
when
they
had
gained
the
first
victory
he
was
to
have
joined
them
with
fifteen
thousand
horse
and
become
a
great
commander
i
should
have
followed
him
too
had
they
been
successful
but
they
were
not
nor
ever
will
be
and
i
am
what
you
see
me
a
strange
history
said
the
man
and
you
have
told
me
more
than
i
ever
knew
before
had
the
peshwa
and
the
rajah
of
nagpoor
played
their
parts
as
well
as
cheetoo
all
would
have
gone
right
but
it
is
useless
to
think
of
them
and
i
suppose
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
our
new
masters
now
however
you
and
i
meer
sahib
must
not
separate
i
am
going
to
indoor
for
some
treasure
and
your
best
way
lies
through
it
i
will
keep
with
you
for
your
party
is
a
large
one
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
like
passing
those
jungles
by
the
sindwah
ghat
with
my
own
the
bheels
are
taking
advantage
of
the
present
disturbances
to
be
all
in
arms
bands
of
deserters
from
the
peshwa
traverse
the
country
in
all
directions
helping
themselves
to
what
they
can
and
they
are
not
over
scrupulous
either
so
we
will
keep
together
if
you
like
for
mutual
protection
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
so
said
i
though
i
have
nothing
to
lose
except
two
or
three
thousand
rupees
and
whoever
comes
to
take
them
will
get
more
blows
than
money
and
i
have
still
less
said
he
i
have
only
enough
to
pay
my
expenses
and
feed
my
camels
but
i
am
no
great
hand
at
fighting
and
am
not
mounted
as
you
are
to
run
from
danger
but
the
belied
his
words
i
was
not
to
be
deceived
and
felt
as
sure
that
the
coveted
treasure
was
there
as
that
the
rokurrea
who
guarded
it
was
before
me
we
shortly
afterwards
separated
and
when
i
was
alone
with
peer
khan
i
told
him
what
i
had
said
and
how
i
had
deceived
the
rokurrea
a
long
and
hearty
laugh
we
had
over
it
but
i
fear
for
you
meer
sahib
said
he
compare
his
power
and
your
own
slight
frame
you
must
risk
nothing
now
i
laughed
his
power
khan
i
said
what
is
it
to
that
of
many
who
have
fallen
under
my
hand
before
now
besides
he
is
the
brother
of
the
rokurrea
we
killed
beyond
boorhanpoor
and
he
must
be
mine
at
all
hazards
i
would
not
miss
this
adventure
for
thousands
i
will
tell
you
what
said
peer
khan
it
will
never
do
to
kill
them
so
far
from
indoor
let
us
get
them
as
near
to
the
city
as
possible
and
we
shall
be
the
nearer
our
own
home
this
matter
will
cause
a
stir
and
we
had
better
not
risk
anything
well
be
it
as
you
will
i
had
intended
to
have
killed
them
near
boorhanpoor
and
then
to
have
turned
off
directly
into
the
hills
we
should
never
be
followed
ay
and
risk
shekh
dulla
and
his
party
who
are
out
said
peer
khan
that
would
never
do
he
would
plunder
us
and
as
he
knows
us
would
most
like
serve
us
as
cheetoo
did
the
poor
fellows
who
were
caught
astaffur
alla
cried
i
shuddering
god
forbid
no
your
plan
is
the
best
we
will
entice
them
out
of
the
towns
before
we
have
gone
many
marches
and
then
they
are
our
own
when
and
wherever
we
please
i
pass
over
our
journey
sahib
all
journeys
are
alike
devoid
of
interest
and
only
one
routine
of
dusty
roads
parching
sun
for
the
rokurreas
would
not
travel
by
night
bad
food
and
discomfort
of
all
kinds
we
met
with
no
adventure
except
being
robbed
of
trifling
articles
at
different
places
and
we
fully
succeeded
in
persuading
the
rokurreas
to
encamp
with
us
as
we
adhered
to
our
old
custom
of
preferring
the
outside
of
the
villages
to
entering
them
where
besides
the
additional
fear
of
thieves
there
was
more
dust
more
dirt
more
heat
and
continual
squabbles
with
the
villagers
my
men
had
behaved
admirably
no
one
could
have
told
from
the
broad
patois
they
spoke
that
they
were
aught
but
what
they
represented
themselves
to
be
and
bhojpoorees
they
looked
as
stupid
a
set
of
owls
as
could
well
be
collected
together
but
they
played
their
parts
to
a
man
with
the
extreme
caution
and
cunning
on
which
rested
the
success
of
our
enterprise
after
all
sahib
can
not
you
now
understand
the
excitement
which
possesses
the
soul
of
a
thug
in
his
pursuit
of
men
can
not
you
feel
with
us
as
you
hear
my
story
and
follow
us
in
my
recital
here
had
we
kept
company
with
these
rokurreas
for
twenty
days
we
had
become
intimate
they
told
their
adventures
we
told
ours
the
evenings
passed
in
singing
or
telling
tales
until
one
by
one
we
sunk
down
wearied
upon
our
carpets
can
not
you
appreciate
the
intense
interest
with
which
we
watched
their
every
movement
nay
every
word
which
fell
from
them
and
our
terrible
alarms
as
sometimes
our
minds
misgave
us
that
we
were
suspected
yet
still
we
stuck
to
them
through
everything
they
were
never
lost
sight
of
for
a
moment
and
above
all
their
minds
were
kept
happy
as
to
their
leader
he
was
delighted
with
me
my
accounts
of
my
adventures
as
a
pindharee
the
plunder
we
had
got
the
towns
we
had
burned
and
sacked
all
were
to
him
interesting
and
day
by
day
i
told
him
of
new
exploits
he
used
to
sit
and
the
rest
of
his
men
too
listening
with
unfeigned
pleasure
to
the
accounts
which
i
and
peer
khan
gave
cunning
as
they
were
at
heart
they
were
honest
and
simple
and
they
readily
believed
all
we
told
them
but
their
time
had
drawn
near
indoor
was
five
marches
further
and
delay
was
now
impracticable
and
useless
besides
to
insure
their
safe
arrival
i
knew
they
had
determined
on
going
thirty
coss
in
one
march
and
my
men
could
not
keep
up
with
these
hardy
fellows
come
what
will
said
i
to
peer
khan
they
die
night
the
time
came
we
were
sitting
as
usual
under
the
same
noble
one
by
one
we
had
sung
our
song
or
related
our
adventures
and
who
could
have
guessed
had
he
seen
us
thus
engaged
that
a
work
of
death
was
to
ensue
every
tongue
was
employed
and
the
hearty
laugh
which
broke
at
times
from
one
or
other
of
the
assembly
showed
how
light
and
merry
were
our
hearts
we
at
the
certainty
of
our
success
the
rokurreas
at
the
thought
that
the
peril
of
the
road
was
past
and
that
their
large
amount
of
treasure
would
reach
its
destination
in
safety
there
was
not
a
grave
face
among
us
there
cried
the
jemadar
of
the
rokurreas
there
is
the
moon
when
she
has
risen
over
the
trees
yonder
we
will
bid
you
farewell
kind
meer
sahib
we
have
been
happy
in
your
company
and
free
from
alarms
and
danger
bhugwan
grant
that
we
may
hereafter
journey
in
company
and
as
safely
as
we
have
done
thanks
to
your
care
in
protecting
us
outside
the
villages
we
have
not
lost
a
cowree
and
we
have
been
taught
a
new
mode
of
encamping
which
we
will
follow
in
future
the
moon
will
last
us
the
whole
night
and
we
shall
have
twenty
coss
of
ground
behind
us
by
the
time
you
wake
from
your
night
sleep
the
thugs
had
taken
their
places
to
each
rokurrea
were
four
stout
men
allotted
and
i
marvelled
that
they
should
have
thus
allowed
themselves
to
be
separated
from
each
other
but
they
had
not
suspected
who
have
done
so
the
moon
rose
majestically
above
the
distant
trees
her
full
round
and
yellow
orb
cast
a
mellow
light
upon
our
group
the
rokurreas
rose
with
one
accord
and
each
turned
to
the
men
he
was
near
to
give
them
his
parting
benediction
and
salutation
nay
said
i
we
part
not
thus
narrayun
das
let
us
separate
as
friends
receive
my
embrace
we
are
friends
and
brothers
by
profession
we
embraced
and
before
the
others
could
press
forward
to
salute
me
i
gave
the
jhirnee
pan
lao
i
exclaimed
it
was
enough
the
jemadar
fell
beneath
my
own
handkerchief
and
a
few
shrieks
and
groans
told
the
rest
all
had
died
haste
ye
my
good
fellows
cried
i
to
the
lughaees
the
same
bright
moon
which
was
to
have
served
these
fellows
shines
brightly
upon
us
quick
with
your
work
the
camels
are
ready
and
a
few
hours
will
see
us
safe
from
pursuit
though
indeed
none
is
to
be
apprehended
from
this
small
place
the
bodies
were
stripped
every
fellow
had
a
heavy
humeana
besides
what
was
laden
on
the
camels
we
stopped
not
to
count
our
money
but
hastened
on
when
the
interment
was
finished
and
only
tarrying
for
a
few
moments
at
the
next
village
we
came
to
to
purchase
the
goor
for
the
tupounee
we
found
ourselves
in
the
morning
nearly
twenty
coss
from
the
scene
of
our
last
night
adventure
we
halted
till
the
evening
and
again
pushed
on
but
by
a
different
road
and
leaving
indoor
about
fifteen
coss
to
the
right
we
directed
our
course
to
a
small
village
named
dehalpoor
from
this
leaving
oojein
also
to
the
right
we
hastened
on
always
travelling
by
night
on
account
of
the
extreme
heat
of
the
weather
and
by
way
of
buhadoorgurh
and
aorcha
we
reached
jhalone
in
safety
no
alarm
had
we
but
one
the
revenue
officers
on
the
frontier
of
holkar
dominions
insisted
on
knowing
who
we
were
and
what
we
had
with
us
and
so
strict
were
their
inquiries
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
english
pass
i
had
with
me
we
must
have
been
suspected
and
apprehended
but
thanks
to
soobhan
khan
it
was
not
questioned
as
futih
mahomed
i
passed
free
a
duty
or
rather
an
exaction
of
fifty
rupees
was
levied
on
the
treasure
and
a
fresh
pass
given
to
us
by
which
we
escaped
further
questioning
and
detention
who
can
describe
my
father
joy
at
seeing
the
treasure
the
old
man
was
in
ecstasy
he
kissed
me
he
embraced
me
called
me
by
every
endearing
name
and
extolled
my
conduct
in
glowing
terms
to
ganesha
who
happened
to
be
with
him
it
was
easy
to
see
however
that
to
that
worthy
they
might
well
have
been
spared
jealousy
possessed
him
which
he
could
ill
disguise
and
i
verily
believe
had
he
dared
that
he
would
have
informed
the
rajah
of
the
treasure
we
had
secured
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
thug
no
such
booty
had
ever
been
gained
and
i
was
classed
by
the
thugs
with
jhora
naeck
and
kuduk
bunwaree
fabled
votaries
of
bhowanee
of
whom
stories
were
told
which
though
implicitly
believed
by
most
nay
all
of
our
fraternity
i
never
credited
but
it
was
enough
for
me
i
had
never
met
a
reverse
and
every
thug
of
hindostan
i
verily
believe
only
thought
he
must
join
me
to
secure
to
himself
a
booty
which
would
support
him
for
years
i
have
forgotten
however
to
mention
to
you
an
incident
which
befell
us
at
buhadoorgurh
we
were
encamped
outside
the
town
and
late
in
the
evening
we
saw
a
body
of
men
whom
we
at
first
took
to
be
thugs
coming
towards
our
camp
who
can
they
be
said
i
to
peer
khan
they
look
like
thugs
yet
it
is
late
for
any
party
to
be
out
some
straggling
party
i
suppose
said
he
i
will
go
and
see
if
they
are
thugs
and
you
know
them
i
added
bring
them
but
say
not
a
word
of
our
booty
no
no
i
am
not
such
a
fool
said
he
laughing
but
i
will
bring
you
the
news
he
went
and
returned
with
the
leader
of
the
party
i
had
purposely
kept
in
my
little
tent
in
order
that
my
face
might
not
be
seen
in
case
they
were
strangers
and
to
conceal
it
effectually
i
tied
a
handkerchief
over
my
mouth
and
chin
salam
aliekoom
said
a
gruff
voice
as
a
man
with
peer
khan
entered
the
tent
you
are
welcome
friend
said
i
sit
down
he
was
evidently
weary
with
travel
and
seated
himself
slowly
your
name
said
i
and
who
are
you
my
name
replied
the
man
is
well
known
i
dare
say
to
most
people
and
they
are
afraid
of
it
i
am
called
lall
khan
or
familiarly
lalloo
i
have
not
heard
it
before
said
i
but
who
are
you
and
your
men
oh
we
are
free
traders
who
help
ourselves
to
what
we
can
get
with
a
strong
hand
some
wandering
pindharees
thought
i
and
i
asked
him
if
they
were
such
not
exactly
said
he
we
are
dacoos
worse
and
worse
said
i
laughing
and
i
suppose
you
are
from
delhi
ay
replied
he
even
so
we
know
you
though
you
do
not
know
us
we
know
you
to
be
thugs
by
your
encampment
but
never
fear
us
brethren
should
not
interfere
with
each
other
we
have
different
ways
of
helping
ourselves
to
spoil
but
what
matter
we
are
brothers
in
a
general
sense
of
the
word
good
we
are
and
if
i
can
help
you
say
so
in
no
wise
said
he
but
to
give
us
room
among
ye
for
the
night
we
will
be
off
early
if
you
do
not
go
the
same
road
room
ye
shall
have
khan
till
the
moon
rises
and
food
too
but
after
that
we
are
off
we
travel
northwards
then
it
can
not
be
helped
he
replied
we
will
stay
here
till
you
go
and
occupy
your
ground
afterwards
we
shall
not
be
suspected
and
where
are
you
going
i
asked
to
hyderabad
said
the
man
no
one
suspects
dacoos
to
be
out
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
we
shall
have
the
whole
road
to
ourselves
we
shall
return
after
the
rains
about
the
dussera
by
the
nagpoor
road
now
we
are
going
by
bhopal
and
boorhanpoor
and
your
luck
said
i
have
you
had
good
bunij
for
this
word
was
understood
by
them
and
is
common
to
all
classes
of
people
who
do
their
work
on
the
roads
middling
said
he
neither
good
nor
bad
we
have
had
a
few
affairs
but
nothing
to
boast
of
well
said
i
you
have
taken
a
good
line
the
road
from
boorhanpoor
to
hyderabad
is
a
good
one
and
you
will
be
in
sikundur
jah
country
where
no
one
asks
questions
about
the
people
who
are
left
on
the
highways
i
wish
you
good
luck
and
my
friend
will
look
after
your
comforts
you
must
excuse
me
as
i
am
in
pain
from
a
swelled
face
and
toothache
salam
said
he
as
he
departed
if
you
were
going
instead
of
returning
we
might
get
good
plunder
in
company
we
dacoos
are
rare
hands
at
rough
work
i
had
spoken
in
a
disguised
voice
and
it
was
impossible
he
could
recognize
me
again
if
he
met
me
i
did
this
for
an
object
which
occurred
to
me
at
the
moment
as
you
shall
learn
hereafter
i
mentioned
this
meeting
to
my
father
what
hinders
us
said
i
from
meeting
them
as
they
come
up
they
will
be
laden
with
spoil
and
will
be
an
easy
prey
brave
and
reckless
as
they
are
they
have
no
wit
and
will
never
find
us
out
i
do
know
that
said
my
father
they
are
not
so
stupid
as
you
think
i
know
much
of
them
have
killed
some
of
them
and
they
were
cunning
enough
several
gangs
of
them
have
escaped
thugs
by
being
able
to
detect
them
however
i
see
nothing
objectionable
in
your
plan
and
at
any
rate
it
will
furnish
excuse
for
a
new
expedition
ay
said
ganesha
who
was
present
let
us
go
i
long
to
see
the
meer
sahib
act
we
hear
so
much
of
him
that
by
bhowanee
perhaps
an
unlucky
old
thug
like
myself
may
pick
up
something
new
will
you
let
me
come
also
certainly
said
i
but
you
will
see
no
more
than
you
know
already
lucky
i
have
been
but
you
know
my
pretensions
to
knowledge
are
very
small
and
i
have
never
boasted
of
them
to
my
perception
the
whole
art
consists
in
having
a
smooth
tongue
in
one
head
and
a
man
who
is
a
good
bhuttote
rarely
makes
a
good
sotha
yet
you
are
both
meer
sahib
said
ganesha
with
a
malicious
grin
and
your
men
would
follow
you
to
the
death
so
they
will
said
i
for
i
am
kind
and
considerate
to
them
and
reward
them
handsomely
this
stung
him
to
the
quick
for
he
was
a
rough
bully
and
though
perhaps
one
of
the
best
bhuttotes
then
living
was
no
hand
at
inveigling
travellers
and
as
he
always
persisted
in
being
a
sotha
himself
he
was
notoriously
unlucky
but
few
men
too
would
serve
under
him
he
was
preparing
to
retort
sharply
when
my
father
stopped
him
let
him
alone
said
he
he
is
a
proud
boy
and
bickerings
among
us
lead
to
no
good
you
must
not
think
on
what
he
has
said
nay
ismail
said
he
with
the
air
of
an
offended
child
i
care
not
what
he
says
pride
will
have
its
fall
and
i
may
live
to
see
it
i
was
very
angry
but
there
was
no
use
in
saying
more
had
we
been
alone
he
should
have
answered
for
so
you
see
sahib
out
of
a
trifling
incident
a
new
expedition
was
determined
on
we
all
prayed
it
might
be
more
favourable
than
the
former
one
which
was
planned
in
that
direction
and
i
confess
that
my
success
in
the
last
had
strengthened
my
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
the
omens
though
as
yet
by
no
means
established
it
experience
they
say
is
always
bought
at
a
costly
price
and
is
bitter
when
you
have
got
it
and
i
had
to
buy
mine
though
the
time
was
not
yet
come
but
soobhan
khan
who
was
he
said
i
to
ameer
ali
and
did
you
pay
him
his
price
of
blood
not
a
cowree
of
it
said
ameer
ali
but
you
shall
hear
i
asked
my
father
who
he
was
and
detailed
the
whole
of
my
adventures
with
him
he
remembered
the
man
the
instant
i
spoke
of
him
the
rascal
cried
my
father
and
is
he
so
rich
and
honoured
the
son
of
a
vile
woman
to
think
that
he
should
be
in
such
a
situation
the
scoundrel
but
the
deeds
of
alla
are
inscrutable
listen
my
son
to
his
story
which
can
be
told
in
a
few
words
he
and
i
were
jemadars
together
i
never
liked
him
and
he
had
a
bad
reputation
he
was
never
a
good
bhuttote
for
the
fellow
was
an
arrant
coward
but
he
was
a
capital
sotha
and
his
smooth
tongue
gained
him
more
bunij
than
we
could
gain
by
straightforward
work
well
many
years
ago
we
joined
together
he
to
be
sotha
and
i
to
manage
the
other
work
we
had
killed
a
large
body
of
travellers
near
jeypoor
for
we
had
a
numerous
gang
two
were
sahoukars
and
the
booty
was
large
among
it
were
some
pearls
and
precious
stones
they
were
given
over
to
his
party
as
their
share
and
he
said
he
would
go
to
indoor
to
sell
them
but
i
had
lent
him
nearly
a
thousand
rupees
at
different
times
when
he
had
no
money
to
make
advances
to
men
to
induce
them
to
serve
under
him
and
i
pressed
him
for
some
of
the
pearls
which
i
wanted
for
my
wife
in
payment
of
the
money
this
was
late
one
night
after
we
had
divided
the
spoil
he
said
he
would
give
me
them
in
the
morning
when
i
could
pick
out
the
strings
i
liked
best
and
he
spoke
so
winningly
that
i
fool
as
i
was
never
doubted
him
that
night
he
absconded
and
i
never
heard
of
him
till
this
extraordinary
account
of
yours
pay
him
continued
my
father
not
the
value
of
a
broken
cowree
shall
he
ever
get
in
any
other
man
i
might
have
pardoned
it
but
in
him
the
conduct
was
ingratitude
in
the
highest
degree
for
had
i
not
assisted
and
upheld
him
he
would
have
been
neglected
and
have
starved
this
then
was
the
secret
of
soobhan
khan
wealth
he
must
have
sold
his
pearls
one
by
one
as
he
had
hinted
to
me
that
he
had
traded
in
them
and
raised
himself
by
bribery
to
the
state
he
was
in
of
course
i
neither
sent
him
his
money
as
i
had
promised
nor
wrote
him
a
line
to
say
that
i
had
arrived
safely
at
jhalone
i
destroyed
his
pass
too
as
it
might
have
led
to
detection
chapter
xli
i
have
told
you
of
my
popularity
among
the
thugs
and
when
it
became
known
that
a
new
expedition
was
planned
and
would
set
out
after
the
dussera
so
many
men
offered
themselves
that
i
was
obliged
to
reject
numbers
and
select
those
whom
i
knew
from
experience
and
character
would
be
likely
to
behave
best
among
them
were
a
few
who
were
excellent
musicians
and
singers
i
had
before
on
many
occasions
felt
the
want
of
such
men
to
amuse
travellers
with
whom
i
had
fallen
in
and
these
were
particularly
acceptable
to
me
at
the
present
time
as
the
expedition
was
a
large
one
and
the
country
being
quieter
and
more
settled
than
it
had
been
for
some
years
we
were
assured
that
the
roads
would
be
full
of
persons
of
rank
and
consequence
travelling
to
and
from
their
homes
in
order
that
our
band
might
have
the
greater
appearance
of
respectability
i
begged
of
my
father
to
accompany
us
for
his
venerable
appearance
and
polished
manners
would
i
was
certain
do
more
to
insure
us
success
than
all
our
most
cunning
stratagems
nor
was
i
neglectful
of
the
rajah
from
time
to
time
i
visited
his
durbar
and
was
always
received
with
the
greatest
civility
and
attention
as
indeed
i
deserved
for
not
only
was
i
a
good
servant
to
him
but
as
numbers
of
thugs
had
settled
around
me
in
different
villages
the
revenue
they
paid
for
his
protection
and
connivance
at
our
work
amounted
to
a
handsome
sum
yearly
and
i
need
not
say
it
was
punctually
paid
for
upon
this
mainly
depended
our
concealment
in
the
last
expedition
however
i
had
pleaded
poverty
on
my
return
and
though
i
could
have
well
spared
five
thousand
rupees
from
my
own
share
i
was
content
with
presenting
as
my
nuzzur
a
gun
i
had
purchased
in
bombay
for
two
hundred
rupees
and
a
small
string
of
pearls
which
i
had
found
among
the
treasure
of
the
rokurreas
and
he
seemed
satisfied
but
it
was
merely
the
feigned
content
which
precedes
a
violent
outbreak
of
discontent
or
passion
he
was
our
bitter
deadly
enemy
though
he
cloaked
his
designs
under
the
garb
of
friendship
and
was
gradually
perfecting
his
schemes
for
our
destruction
we
set
out
i
have
nothing
new
or
interesting
to
relate
to
you
of
the
manner
in
which
our
preparations
were
made
and
completed
azima
too
poor
soul
never
dreamed
of
what
we
were
it
was
enough
for
her
to
know
that
every
new
expedition
brought
her
new
ornaments
and
better
clothes
and
enabled
her
to
live
in
a
higher
and
more
expensive
manner
i
had
been
enabled
to
add
greatly
to
my
house
and
it
was
now
as
comfortable
and
spacious
as
i
could
desire
she
knew
too
that
with
increased
wealth
she
could
look
for
a
higher
alliance
for
our
daughter
our
only
child
and
she
had
even
now
received
proposals
of
marriage
for
her
some
of
which
were
in
every
way
advantageous
and
with
persons
unconnected
with
our
profession
of
which
i
was
glad
for
knowing
full
well
that
one
mischance
or
one
traitor
among
us
would
hurl
me
at
once
from
my
prosperity
i
was
desirous
of
marrying
her
to
some
one
who
could
protect
her
and
be
free
from
any
dangers
similar
to
those
i
was
myself
exposed
to
i
however
bade
azima
wait
because
as
i
told
her
the
journey
i
was
about
to
undertake
would
be
infallibly
prosperous
and
a
fresh
addition
to
our
already
ample
means
would
enable
us
to
have
the
marriage
ceremony
performed
in
a
manner
fitting
or
perhaps
exceeding
our
pretensions
she
readily
acceded
to
my
request
for
if
there
be
one
thing
more
than
another
about
which
a
matron
of
hindostan
is
solicitous
it
is
the
marriage
of
her
child
not
as
regards
happiness
i
must
own
though
perhaps
there
may
be
a
lurking
wish
that
she
may
be
happy
but
the
main
matter
is
that
her
clothes
shall
be
of
the
best
and
richest
materials
her
jewels
many
and
of
value
and
the
whole
of
the
establishment
which
she
takes
to
her
new
lord
of
the
most
substantial
description
that
they
may
last
her
for
years
and
procure
for
her
mother
the
goodwill
of
the
female
members
of
her
family
nothing
is
productive
of
more
quarrels
among
the
females
than
that
anything
should
appear
indifferent
remarks
are
made
and
reproaches
are
bandied
about
between
the
united
families
and
out
of
these
soon
grows
an
enmity
which
never
cools
many
a
marriage
which
promised
well
at
its
outset
has
been
marred
in
its
joyous
termination
by
fault
being
found
with
the
equipments
of
the
bride
which
are
always
submitted
for
inspection
to
her
female
relations
before
they
become
her
own
property
for
ever
but
i
am
digressing
and
must
return
to
my
own
adventures
we
left
jhalone
as
before
upwards
of
three
hundred
thugs
under
my
father
ganesha
peer
khan
and
myself
we
gave
out
along
the
road
that
we
were
servants
of
the
nizam
and
were
returning
to
our
service
at
hyderabad
after
our
periodical
leave
of
absence
this
was
necessary
for
our
numbers
without
it
would
have
provoked
suspicion
never
shall
i
forget
the
first
matter
we
took
in
hand
not
that
there
was
anything
remarkable
in
the
destruction
of
four
men
but
it
was
attended
by
a
sad
result
which
damped
the
spirits
of
the
party
for
many
days
afterwards
and
from
which
never
recovered
peer
khan
had
a
nephew
a
boy
of
about
ten
years
old
a
noble
little
fellow
beautiful
in
his
features
and
intelligent
beyond
his
years
as
you
may
imagine
he
was
a
great
favourite
among
us
all
and
i
had
repeatedly
asked
peer
khan
to
allow
me
to
adopt
him
as
my
son
to
supply
the
place
of
the
child
i
had
lost
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
for
the
child
was
the
son
of
a
beloved
sister
who
was
dead
the
boy
father
had
also
died
about
two
years
before
and
peer
khan
had
taken
him
to
his
home
and
loved
him
as
his
own
the
little
fellow
rode
a
spirited
pony
which
i
had
given
him
was
always
in
the
van
of
the
party
and
amused
us
by
his
mimic
feats
of
horsemanship
and
by
his
intelligent
prattle
he
could
never
be
kept
behind
and
when
the
time
came
that
the
four
men
were
to
meet
their
fate
we
had
given
him
in
charge
to
those
who
brought
up
the
rear
with
strict
orders
that
on
no
account
was
he
to
be
permitted
to
come
on
after
us
peer
khan
also
had
desired
him
to
keep
with
these
people
as
he
was
going
off
the
road
to
a
village
at
some
distance
and
he
had
promised
obedience
yet
all
our
precautions
were
of
no
avail
how
could
they
be
when
what
followed
had
evidently
been
written
in
his
destiny
i
had
just
given
the
jhirnee
and
the
four
miserable
men
were
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
death
one
of
them
too
was
shrieking
when
ya
alla
who
should
come
galloping
up
but
alum
khan
the
boy
i
have
mentioned
his
first
exclamation
was
of
triumph
that
he
had
caught
us
but
how
can
i
tell
the
look
of
horror
to
which
his
countenance
was
instantly
changed
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on
his
eyes
became
fixed
and
were
wide
open
his
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
uttered
no
sound
but
clasped
his
hands
in
agony
and
before
i
could
dismount
or
even
peer
khan
who
was
superintending
the
work
he
had
fallen
from
his
pony
insensible
what
shall
we
do
cried
i
to
peer
khan
as
we
raised
him
up
and
strove
to
comfort
him
speak
to
him
a
word
from
you
may
arouse
him
my
child
my
child
cried
peer
khan
in
accents
of
terror
and
misery
oh
speak
to
me
one
word
only
you
are
killing
your
parent
ya
alla
continued
he
raising
his
hands
to
heaven
grant
that
this
swoon
may
pass
away
and
that
he
may
speak
i
will
feed
a
hundred
fakeers
in
thy
name
o
merciful
prophet
if
thou
wilt
but
intercede
and
grant
my
prayer
but
it
was
of
no
avail
the
poor
boy
lay
senseless
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
staring
and
not
a
word
could
he
utter
the
thugs
too
had
left
the
dead
and
were
all
around
us
there
was
a
rivulet
close
by
in
which
the
bhil
had
been
prepared
i
thought
of
water
and
bid
one
of
the
men
run
for
some
it
was
brought
and
i
poured
it
into
his
mouth
he
revives
his
lips
move
cried
peer
khan
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
he
speaks
and
the
poor
boy
did
speak
where
am
i
uncle
said
he
in
a
faint
voice
where
am
i
what
have
i
seen
and
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
nothing
nothing
cried
his
uncle
you
have
fallen
from
your
pony
that
is
all
you
should
not
ride
so
hard
my
child
you
might
have
been
killed
no
no
said
the
boy
i
did
not
fall
i
saw
alla
save
me
save
me
uncle
oh
look
at
their
eyes
and
faces
there
they
lie
oh
kill
me
i
can
not
bear
it
i
shall
die
unhappy
child
he
had
again
seen
their
faces
we
had
never
thought
of
the
dead
one
of
the
bodies
lay
close
to
us
the
distorted
features
grinning
horribly
and
it
had
fallen
against
a
bank
so
that
he
saw
it
sitting
half
upright
a
dreadful
spectacle
for
a
child
take
it
away
take
it
away
he
shouted
in
his
infant
voice
i
shall
die
oh
bury
me
i
shall
never
forget
the
face
and
the
eyes
they
will
be
ever
before
me
away
with
them
cried
i
and
as
i
turned
again
to
the
child
he
had
sunk
on
his
face
in
the
sand
of
the
road
and
was
endeavouring
to
hide
himself
in
it
he
was
in
strong
convulsions
alla
alla
what
shall
i
do
cried
peer
khan
oh
meer
sahib
by
your
soul
by
your
mother
honour
do
something
save
that
child
and
i
will
be
your
slave
till
the
end
of
my
days
i
will
serve
you
on
my
knees
i
will
be
your
menial
what
can
be
done
said
i
all
we
can
do
is
to
stay
with
him
and
comfort
him
when
the
paroxysm
is
past
he
will
revive
soon
and
forget
all
poor
boy
how
he
strove
in
his
convulsions
he
could
not
speak
intelligibly
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
his
lips
grew
livid
and
contracted
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
seemed
sunk
into
his
head
i
had
never
seen
such
terror
before
nor
could
i
have
believed
that
it
would
have
had
such
an
effect
on
any
one
we
carried
him
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
by
dint
of
bathing
his
face
and
forcing
water
into
his
mouth
he
partly
revived
he
had
just
opened
his
eyes
again
when
by
a
miserable
chance
they
fell
upon
one
of
the
turbans
of
the
dead
men
with
which
i
had
been
wiping
his
face
it
had
an
instantaneous
effect
on
him
his
screams
broke
out
afresh
nothing
could
console
him
and
we
were
in
dreadful
alarm
about
him
what
to
do
we
knew
not
we
were
far
away
from
any
human
habitation
and
even
had
we
been
near
one
we
dared
not
have
called
in
any
hukeem
to
see
him
for
his
incoherent
ravings
would
have
too
truly
exposed
our
doings
we
sat
by
the
boy
in
fearful
apprehensions
that
every
throe
and
convulsion
would
cause
his
death
at
last
we
raised
him
up
and
placed
him
on
his
pony
and
had
succeeded
in
conveying
him
about
a
coss
while
he
was
in
a
state
of
insensibility
but
it
was
of
no
avail
again
he
awoke
from
his
temporary
unconsciousness
and
we
were
obliged
to
take
him
down
and
lay
him
on
a
bank
at
the
side
of
the
road
while
we
fanned
his
face
and
endeavoured
to
compose
him
but
he
was
greatly
reduced
in
strength
his
moans
were
feebler
and
feebler
and
though
he
now
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
calmly
around
him
it
was
but
too
plain
to
us
that
the
delicate
flower
had
been
blighted
and
was
fast
withering
under
the
terror
which
possessed
him
peer
khan
was
in
a
dreadful
state
he
raved
he
entreated
he
prayed
he
knelt
down
beside
the
poor
sufferer
and
bedewed
his
face
with
his
tears
which
were
fast
falling
but
no
mercy
was
shown
him
we
sat
thus
till
long
past
numerous
travellers
passed
us
all
commiserating
the
child
state
of
suffering
but
they
shook
their
heads
as
they
left
us
with
a
firm
conviction
that
he
must
die
and
he
did
die
towards
evening
the
pure
spirit
fled
from
the
suffering
body
and
we
were
left
alone
in
the
wild
waste
with
the
dead
it
is
of
no
use
lamenting
now
said
i
to
peer
khan
as
he
sat
his
hands
clasped
in
anguish
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
and
moaning
and
sobbing
as
though
his
spirit
would
break
it
is
of
no
use
brother
the
boy
is
dead
and
we
must
carry
the
body
on
to
the
stage
which
is
not
very
far
distant
do
as
you
will
he
replied
as
for
me
my
heart
is
broken
i
shall
never
look
up
again
he
was
the
life
of
my
soul
and
without
him
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
but
we
raised
the
body
up
and
at
times
carrying
it
at
others
placing
it
before
us
on
our
horses
we
conveyed
it
to
the
camp
our
absence
had
been
known
but
as
its
cause
was
also
known
none
of
the
thugs
had
come
out
to
meet
us
we
laid
down
our
sad
burden
in
my
tent
a
grave
was
quickly
dug
and
it
was
buried
by
amidst
the
tears
and
lamentations
of
the
whole
band
for
the
boy
was
beloved
by
all
peer
khan
came
to
me
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
awoke
me
from
a
restless
slumber
in
which
the
dreams
of
the
sad
scene
had
fearfully
mingled
i
was
glad
that
he
had
come
but
not
for
what
followed
meer
sahib
said
he
after
a
long
silence
i
am
not
what
i
was
i
never
shall
be
again
i
am
broken
in
spirit
and
am
no
longer
fit
for
my
profession
my
fate
too
points
against
it
and
after
this
dreadful
catastrophe
i
should
be
useless
to
you
permit
me
therefore
to
depart
you
see
i
am
calm
and
composed
and
i
do
not
say
what
i
now
urge
on
you
in
passion
or
grief
therefore
let
me
depart
i
will
go
to
my
home
and
in
solitude
endeavour
to
make
the
remainder
of
my
life
acceptable
to
alla
who
has
visited
me
with
this
affliction
nor
will
it
be
long
ere
the
earth
covers
me
i
feel
that
this
blow
has
shaken
me
to
my
soul
and
it
will
bow
me
down
to
the
grave
i
saw
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
him
his
features
were
stamped
with
despair
and
to
contravene
a
man
fate
is
impossible
it
is
the
will
of
alla
and
what
mortal
can
oppose
it
it
must
have
its
course
go
said
i
peer
khan
may
peace
be
with
you
and
the
blessing
of
the
prophet
i
feel
for
you
i
shall
ever
grieve
with
you
but
if
in
your
inclination
leads
you
to
join
me
i
need
not
say
how
gladly
i
shall
avail
myself
of
your
services
we
have
been
friends
and
brothers
and
we
part
such
i
hope
after
years
of
a
sincere
and
mutual
affection
he
could
not
reply
to
me
he
wrung
my
hands
while
the
big
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
over
his
manly
features
he
made
attempts
to
address
me
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
and
at
length
throwing
himself
at
my
feet
he
kissed
them
and
embraced
my
knees
he
then
arose
and
after
gazing
on
me
for
a
moment
with
features
working
under
the
effects
of
suppressed
emotion
he
rushed
from
my
presence
for
ever
ay
for
ever
when
we
returned
to
jhalone
he
was
dead
his
grief
had
killed
him
he
had
been
more
to
me
than
any
of
my
other
companions
and
deeply
i
sorrowed
over
his
untimely
fate
i
said
this
event
threw
a
gloom
over
our
party
which
did
not
pass
away
for
many
days
but
gradually
the
men
assumed
their
wonted
cheerfulness
and
again
the
song
the
jest
and
the
tale
were
heard
in
our
merry
and
camp
nor
was
the
more
serious
part
of
our
object
neglected
within
a
march
or
two
of
jubbulpoor
we
had
heard
that
a
moonshee
stated
to
be
a
man
of
great
wealth
was
travelling
before
us
to
nagpoor
and
we
made
an
effort
to
overtake
him
we
effected
this
march
from
jubbulpoor
on
the
nagpoor
side
and
were
now
entering
on
our
best
ground
i
say
our
best
as
there
were
but
few
inhabitants
in
that
miserable
country
we
overtook
the
moonshee
but
had
it
not
been
that
we
were
nearly
three
hundred
thugs
in
number
we
should
have
hesitated
to
attack
so
large
a
party
as
his
he
had
two
tents
horses
camels
a
palankeen
and
bearers
and
servants
and
we
deliberated
long
over
the
matter
the
omens
however
having
been
consulted
were
found
to
be
favourable
and
therefore
we
hesitated
no
longer
but
now
laid
our
plans
to
effect
an
object
which
promised
so
much
plunder
we
encamped
close
to
the
moonshee
for
two
days
of
course
this
led
to
intercourse
hearing
that
we
were
respectable
persons
he
sent
to
my
father
and
myself
to
come
to
him
on
the
second
evening
and
we
went
the
moonshee
was
in
the
employment
of
the
europeans
he
had
served
with
the
force
at
jalna
under
general
doveton
though
we
could
not
make
out
whether
he
was
a
servant
of
that
officer
or
not
but
he
spoke
of
him
in
such
terms
as
led
us
to
suppose
he
was
he
told
us
that
now
the
country
was
settled
he
had
obtained
leave
to
go
to
hindostan
and
was
returning
with
his
wife
and
child
we
spent
a
pleasant
evening
with
him
for
he
was
a
man
of
extensive
information
and
amused
us
with
many
anecdotes
and
accounts
of
the
feringhees
of
whom
he
spoke
in
terms
of
the
highest
praise
and
undeceived
us
as
to
many
particulars
we
had
heard
of
them
and
materially
removed
many
of
our
prejudices
against
them
i
respected
them
more
from
what
he
said
than
i
had
ever
done
before
for
though
every
one
acknowledged
they
were
good
and
brave
soldiers
it
was
said
they
were
vicious
and
debauched
and
drunken
at
one
or
two
questions
of
mine
the
moonshee
laughed
immoderately
i
asked
him
once
why
the
europeans
eat
with
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
instead
of
with
their
fingers
which
god
had
given
them
yes
said
my
father
old
as
i
am
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
this
out
tell
us
for
you
know
as
you
have
yourself
seen
them
eat
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
said
the
moonshee
and
i
will
give
you
an
answer
it
appears
so
extraordinary
said
i
that
i
can
hardly
believe
it
for
why
should
not
all
men
be
the
same
nevertheless
i
have
heard
and
from
what
i
thought
to
be
good
authority
that
their
contain
poison
and
therefore
they
dare
not
risk
the
chance
of
their
drawing
blood
nay
more
of
touching
their
food
how
he
laughed
i
thought
he
would
never
have
ended
and
i
felt
nettled
that
my
remark
should
have
given
rise
to
such
immoderate
mirth
i
could
hear
too
from
the
tittering
behind
the
division
of
the
tent
that
the
women
were
also
provoked
to
merriment
at
my
expense
at
last
he
said
no
no
meer
sahib
this
is
folly
who
could
have
told
you
such
a
lie
what
if
their
skins
be
white
and
their
faces
ruddy
are
they
not
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
we
are
they
eat
with
spoons
and
knives
because
it
is
the
custom
of
their
country
and
because
they
do
not
like
to
soil
their
hands
besides
their
style
of
cookery
is
different
to
ours
for
instance
they
roast
half
a
sheep
and
eat
it
and
how
could
they
do
so
without
the
implements
they
use
i
confess
my
ignorance
said
i
and
am
ashamed
to
put
any
more
questions
to
you
about
them
so
shall
believe
henceforward
that
all
i
have
heard
are
lies
yet
i
longed
at
the
same
time
to
ask
more
about
their
drinking
scenes
and
the
meaning
of
the
words
hip
hip
hip
which
i
fully
believed
to
be
of
mystic
import
it
was
late
when
we
separated
but
before
we
did
so
we
agreed
to
travel
in
company
and
to
pass
our
evenings
together
this
was
what
we
wanted
our
success
was
inevitable
should
we
succeed
in
getting
him
on
one
or
two
marches
further
as
the
villagers
there
knew
us
were
our
friends
and
for
a
small
consideration
would
keep
themselves
to
their
houses
and
allow
us
to
do
what
we
liked
i
have
not
mentioned
this
before
sahib
for
you
very
well
know
that
it
is
the
case
we
have
friends
wherever
we
go
we
bribe
all
we
can
and
have
our
agents
in
every
part
of
the
country
in
the
disguise
of
fakeers
or
merchants
some
zemindars
fear
us
others
bully
us
and
extort
large
sums
from
us
but
they
are
generally
faithful
and
without
their
help
and
connivance
do
you
think
we
could
effect
anything
we
could
not
in
the
country
particularly
we
are
well
aided
many
of
the
zemindars
have
thugs
in
regular
pay
whom
they
have
been
in
the
habit
of
sending
out
on
the
road
some
are
content
with
a
certain
sum
a
year
others
who
fear
so
close
a
connexion
with
us
now
and
then
pretend
to
arrest
us
and
get
as
much
as
they
can
and
as
there
is
no
police
of
any
kind
they
are
not
afraid
of
their
dealings
being
brought
to
light
i
myself
know
but
little
of
how
these
matters
are
managed
there
i
mean
from
personal
experience
but
i
have
heard
from
others
and
in
particular
from
motee
who
led
a
gang
of
thugs
for
some
years
all
over
the
huzoor
dominions
and
told
me
that
so
long
as
he
paid
the
potails
of
villages
the
zemindars
and
the
revenue
servants
he
had
no
obstruction
that
hundreds
of
others
did
the
same
and
practised
their
profession
so
openly
that
they
often
never
took
the
trouble
of
burying
the
bodies
of
those
they
destroyed
you
know
that
this
is
truth
sahib
and
therefore
i
need
hardly
mention
it
but
to
my
story
we
reached
the
village
we
wished
to
gain
a
miserable
hamlet
called
biseynee
but
the
potail
was
in
our
interest
and
a
present
of
twenty
rupees
now
and
then
with
sometimes
a
new
turban
gained
us
his
silence
and
i
say
for
he
often
gave
over
passengers
to
thugs
by
declaring
that
his
village
was
unsafe
and
that
they
must
go
and
encamp
outside
with
the
rest
who
were
the
thugs
he
knew
well
what
would
become
of
them
but
he
was
as
i
have
said
paid
for
his
treachery
well
we
reached
biseynee
i
had
purchased
for
the
worthy
potail
a
handsome
turban
and
waistband
and
had
prepared
for
him
a
number
of
other
articles
one
of
which
was
an
english
pistol
which
he
had
sent
word
by
a
thug
that
i
was
to
purchase
for
him
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
went
into
the
village
to
him
and
in
his
own
house
tied
the
turban
on
his
head
presented
him
with
the
gifts
i
had
prepared
and
added
a
purse
of
twenty
rupees
ha
said
he
what
now
meer
sahib
you
are
not
used
to
be
so
liberal
what
bunij
have
you
that
you
are
come
with
it
to
my
poor
place
to
give
it
a
worse
name
than
it
has
already
oh
none
said
i
carelessly
you
know
i
have
not
been
this
way
for
some
years
and
these
are
to
prove
that
i
have
not
forgotten
you
thanks
for
your
kindness
may
your
condescension
increase
said
he
but
the
bunij
meer
sahib
you
are
a
cunning
gentleman
i
know
you
of
old
who
is
he
in
the
tents
yonder
and
why
have
so
many
thugs
collected
here
you
can
not
conceal
your
designs
from
me
nor
do
i
wish
it
said
i
but
remember
our
old
compact
i
do
i
do
said
he
hurriedly
but
times
are
changed
and
with
them
my
masters
know
you
not
that
this
country
belongs
to
the
and
what
of
that
potailjee
said
i
what
difference
does
it
make
none
he
replied
to
but
have
you
not
seen
the
horsemen
what
horsemen
cried
i
six
said
he
and
a
duffadar
my
poor
village
it
seems
has
a
bad
name
for
thieves
and
they
have
sent
a
party
here
to
guard
it
alla
help
us
and
keep
the
bread
in
our
mouths
and
the
duffadar
what
is
he
like
he
is
a
hindoo
said
the
potail
and
a
bhojpooree
he
is
called
hittah
singh
his
men
too
are
all
of
his
tribe
bhojpoorees
said
i
then
i
dare
say
they
are
thugs
what
bhojpooree
was
ever
an
honest
man
no
they
are
not
thugs
meer
sahib
for
i
have
tried
them
with
the
password
but
between
you
and
me
i
think
my
friend
hittah
singh
only
wants
an
opportunity
to
be
as
great
a
rascal
as
i
am
myself
may
alla
pardon
me
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
i
where
is
he
shall
i
call
him
do
so
said
i
if
i
can
not
persuade
him
i
will
bully
him
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
you
know
we
are
more
than
three
hundred
to
six
and
they
would
have
but
little
chance
true
meer
sahib
but
no
violence
i
pray
have
some
consideration
for
my
good
name
if
the
europeans
heard
of
violence
having
been
done
they
would
turn
me
out
of
my
place
and
you
would
turn
thug
i
suppose
but
quick
potailjee
call
the
man
here
he
was
absent
for
a
short
time
and
returned
with
a
short
fellow
and
i
could
plainly
see
that
rascal
was
written
on
his
countenance
you
know
the
old
proverb
chor
ke
daree
men
tinka
there
is
always
a
straw
in
a
thief
beard
salutations
were
exchanged
and
i
came
to
the
point
at
once
look
you
duffadar
sahib
said
i
to
him
you
may
have
guessed
what
we
are
he
nodded
assent
this
is
good
i
continued
as
perhaps
you
may
have
guessed
at
our
object
partly
said
he
but
what
do
i
know
about
you
exactly
said
i
the
very
thing
i
want
you
need
know
nothing
and
you
will
have
nothing
to
tell
if
you
are
ever
asked
take
my
advice
and
remain
quietly
within
your
village
and
if
the
earth
turns
upside
down
you
are
not
to
stir
out
for
this
you
shall
be
well
paid
but
if
you
molest
us
remember
we
are
three
hundred
to
seven
fearful
odds
my
friend
nay
i
am
wise
said
he
what
bhojpooree
is
not
nor
do
i
wish
to
interfere
do
what
you
like
neither
i
nor
my
men
will
stir
a
foot
can
you
depend
on
them
said
i
can
they
be
close
as
close
as
you
wish
them
to
be
jemadar
but
we
must
be
paid
certainly
said
i
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
but
the
reward
depends
on
what
we
get
say
two
hundred
rupees
said
the
fellow
it
is
worth
your
while
well
it
is
a
bargain
duffadar
i
replied
and
the
potail
is
witness
and
now
i
will
give
you
further
advice
which
is
that
you
are
to
know
nothing
and
see
nothing
if
even
the
lord
sahib
were
to
ask
you
you
are
to
know
only
that
travellers
came
and
departed
and
you
kept
no
account
of
them
of
course
said
the
fellow
i
know
this
of
old
i
have
met
parties
of
your
people
in
my
own
country
and
have
no
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
them
they
have
always
behaved
like
men
of
honour
and
kept
their
words
with
me
then
we
are
agreed
said
i
certainly
you
will
see
nought
of
us
and
i
will
come
to
you
at
night
for
my
money
you
had
better
come
now
duffadar
as
i
think
we
shall
move
on
after
it
is
all
over
do
you
go
potailjee
it
would
not
look
well
for
me
to
go
with
the
syud
sahib
do
you
go
and
bring
the
money
come
then
said
i
we
are
losing
time
shall
you
return
soon
asked
the
duffadar
of
me
i
know
not
i
replied
but
it
is
probable
at
any
rate
as
this
country
always
produces
good
booty
for
us
you
will
see
us
here
pretty
often
the
oftener
the
better
said
he
and
i
must
continue
to
keep
my
station
here
it
would
be
hard
to
lose
such
good
friends
you
potailjee
can
help
me
to
a
few
low
caste
rascals
from
time
to
time
to
send
in
as
thieves
we
have
caught
certainly
said
the
potail
there
are
plenty
of
gonds
and
dhérs
in
the
country
every
one
knows
they
are
thieves
and
if
they
may
not
immediately
have
committed
any
robberies
they
have
been
engaged
in
them
some
time
or
other
so
that
it
is
all
the
same
i
will
get
you
a
few
from
time
to
time
as
you
want
them
now
and
then
i
shall
require
a
few
said
he
just
to
keep
up
my
character
and
appearances
and
a
few
years
in
irons
will
do
none
of
them
any
harm
the
government
will
take
care
of
them
i
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
the
cool
manner
in
which
this
was
proposed
and
accepted
but
it
was
the
truth
and
i
know
that
it
was
and
is
now
a
matter
of
occurrence
many
a
duffadar
of
police
has
won
a
good
name
with
his
officers
in
this
way
and
for
one
guilty
man
he
has
seized
a
dozen
innocent
people
who
cares
about
mangs
and
dhérs
they
are
always
villains
and
robbers
chapter
xlii
that
is
a
bhula
admee
a
respectable
man
said
i
to
the
potail
as
he
walked
to
our
camp
he
suits
my
purpose
exactly
he
has
been
on
the
for
some
of
you
said
he
for
a
long
time
we
have
never
spoken
openly
on
the
subject
but
he
has
hinted
as
much
many
times
and
i
suspect
he
chose
this
post
if
he
had
any
choice
in
the
matter
because
he
was
likely
to
meet
thugs
here
if
you
pay
him
well
he
will
help
you
materially
do
you
think
i
have
given
enough
said
i
quite
he
replied
i
do
think
he
expected
you
would
agree
to
so
much
it
is
certainly
a
large
sum
said
i
but
it
is
the
first
and
the
money
is
well
spent
but
you
have
forgotten
me
meer
sahib
am
i
not
to
partake
of
your
bounty
of
course
potailjee
what
i
brought
was
only
a
trifle
i
have
more
for
you
in
the
camp
you
shall
have
your
share
how
much
meer
sahib
i
want
money
my
rents
are
in
arrears
and
i
am
in
distress
thirty
rupees
said
i
make
it
fifty
i
beseech
you
you
know
not
in
what
a
strait
i
am
i
can
not
borrow
the
money
and
you
have
been
sent
by
alla
for
my
deliverance
you
will
lend
me
the
money
if
you
will
not
give
it
me
and
you
will
have
good
bunij
in
this
business
well
said
i
you
shall
have
it
but
on
one
condition
we
may
not
be
on
the
road
when
some
people
whom
we
are
looking
out
for
pass
this
place
they
are
dacoos
they
have
some
tattoos
with
them
and
great
wealth
if
they
pass
either
way
you
must
send
men
after
us
with
a
letter
i
will
send
my
own
sons
well
mounted
replied
he
they
will
easily
find
you
out
and
you
may
depend
on
me
where
will
these
fellows
come
from
they
have
gone
to
hyderabad
now
said
i
and
will
return
by
nagpoor
if
we
meet
them
all
very
well
but
they
may
escape
us
they
shall
not
by
alla
said
the
potail
i
will
watch
for
them
myself
and
if
you
get
them
i
shall
hope
for
a
handsome
present
i
will
not
forget
you
but
here
we
are
at
the
camp
take
care
no
one
sees
the
money
as
you
carry
it
away
trust
an
old
hand
for
that
said
he
with
a
knowing
wink
i
must
go
after
i
have
got
it
to
the
moonshee
who
has
sent
for
me
about
fodder
for
his
horses
i
should
like
to
see
him
too
to
see
a
man
whose
breath
is
in
his
nostrils
and
he
has
a
wife
too
yes
said
i
there
is
no
getting
her
out
of
the
way
so
she
must
die
which
is
a
pity
he
has
a
child
also
about
four
years
old
which
i
want
myself
he
is
a
pretty
boy
and
i
have
no
son
to
bless
me
he
will
never
know
the
difference
between
me
and
his
father
after
a
few
days
i
paid
the
money
and
dismissed
him
ganesha
came
to
me
i
have
been
looking
at
the
ground
said
he
and
there
is
a
hole
near
the
moonshee
tent
which
has
been
dug
for
some
purpose
or
other
apparently
the
commencement
of
a
well
it
will
save
us
the
trouble
of
digging
the
earth
too
lies
close
to
it
and
will
only
have
to
be
filled
in
have
the
lughaees
seen
it
said
i
yes
he
replied
i
took
bhowanee
with
me
he
says
it
is
the
very
thing
now
ganesha
said
i
how
shall
we
manage
oh
do
you
take
the
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
i
will
settle
all
outside
you
have
a
smooth
tongue
and
the
moonshee
is
alone
i
will
be
close
at
hand
in
case
of
anything
going
wrong
but
i
do
not
apprehend
anything
nor
i
either
none
of
the
saeeses
or
camel
men
must
escape
there
are
many
of
them
sixteen
in
all
i
have
counted
them
let
me
see
eight
bearers
two
camel
men
one
of
them
has
a
wife
two
khidmutgars
one
female
servant
and
four
saeeses
how
many
is
that
eighteen
said
i
ah
well
it
does
not
matter
towards
evening
i
will
surround
the
whole
most
of
them
will
be
listening
to
the
songs
and
the
rest
we
must
overpower
in
the
best
way
we
can
the
night
will
be
dark
too
which
is
in
our
favour
i
then
told
him
of
the
horsemen
in
the
village
and
what
i
had
done
he
knew
hittah
singh
the
duffadar
and
told
me
that
in
his
excursions
into
the
district
of
arrah
in
bengal
he
had
met
with
him
and
that
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
been
arrested
for
murder
this
hittah
singh
had
got
him
off
by
swearing
to
the
collector
that
he
knew
him
and
by
being
security
for
him
to
a
large
amount
he
is
a
good
fellow
for
a
bhojpooree
said
ganesha
but
requires
to
be
well
paid
and
you
have
given
him
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
the
evening
came
my
father
and
i
went
to
the
moonshee
but
after
the
evening
prayer
time
he
had
his
son
on
his
knee
and
a
noble
little
fellow
he
was
how
i
shall
love
that
boy
said
i
inwardly
as
i
looked
on
his
fair
and
beautiful
features
and
expressive
eyes
he
came
to
me
readily
and
i
fondled
him
and
displayed
to
his
admiring
eyes
my
beautiful
sword
and
dagger
azima
too
will
love
him
thought
i
and
he
will
supply
the
place
of
our
daughter
when
she
is
married
and
gone
from
us
you
have
no
children
said
the
moonshee
or
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
ask
you
may
have
lost
them
your
brow
darkens
at
the
question
one
replied
i
a
daughter
a
son
the
counterpart
of
the
sahib
zada
it
pleased
allah
to
take
from
me
when
he
was
about
his
age
it
is
indeed
his
will
said
the
moonshee
there
is
no
striving
against
fate
this
boy
is
my
only
offspring
for
many
years
i
had
been
married
and
my
case
was
somewhat
like
that
of
the
sultan
in
the
of
the
parrot
grey
hairs
were
coming
and
i
despaired
but
at
last
alla
was
gracious
and
you
see
the
boy
may
god
grant
he
live
a
hundred
years
and
be
prosperous
said
i
i
have
no
hope
myself
we
conversed
together
for
some
time
and
on
a
message
being
given
from
without
i
said
you
have
been
so
pleased
with
the
singing
of
some
of
my
men
moonshee
sahib
that
they
have
arranged
a
little
masque
after
the
manner
of
the
byroopeas
which
they
are
anxious
to
perform
before
you
it
will
be
absurd
enough
i
dare
say
yet
it
will
serve
to
pass
the
evening
and
your
son
too
may
be
amused
by
all
means
said
he
anything
in
the
jungle
is
acceptable
but
for
your
company
meer
sahib
we
should
have
had
a
dull
march
i
will
prepare
those
within
so
pray
call
in
the
performers
the
men
came
six
stout
fellows
dressed
fantastically
two
of
them
as
women
with
sitars
and
drums
in
their
hands
they
personated
a
body
of
goosaeens
and
danced
and
sang
in
a
ridiculous
manner
where
they
had
learned
their
parts
i
know
not
but
the
whole
was
well
done
and
the
moonshee
little
son
laughed
immoderately
as
we
had
expected
the
whole
of
the
moonshee
people
gathered
round
the
tent
which
was
open
on
one
side
to
admit
of
their
seeing
the
tumasha
and
i
observed
with
secret
exultation
that
every
man
had
two
or
three
thugs
close
to
him
and
one
in
particular
behind
each
of
them
all
was
ready
as
i
thought
and
i
was
about
to
give
the
signal
when
one
of
the
thugs
called
to
me
that
i
was
wanted
without
what
it
could
be
i
knew
not
but
excusing
myself
for
a
moment
i
went
out
what
shall
we
do
said
ganesha
to
me
in
a
voice
full
of
alarm
and
apprehension
meer
sahib
the
feringhees
are
upon
us
the
feringhees
yes
he
replied
and
what
can
we
do
this
good
bunij
will
escape
us
of
course
the
moonshee
will
join
them
and
we
may
then
as
well
think
of
strangling
the
king
of
delhi
as
of
getting
him
but
how
said
i
how
are
the
feringhees
upon
us
have
you
seen
them
no
said
ganesha
but
i
have
seen
their
people
a
long
string
of
camels
have
just
arrived
with
i
know
not
how
many
sepoys
to
guard
them
my
curse
be
on
them
all
and
where
are
they
why
they
are
gone
into
the
village
they
wanted
this
ground
but
i
told
them
i
would
not
give
it
up
that
the
moonshee
was
a
gentleman
of
rank
and
could
not
be
disturbed
and
that
there
was
better
ground
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
then
never
fear
said
i
the
work
must
be
done
immediately
i
will
go
in
and
give
the
jhirnee
and
if
any
of
those
prying
rascals
the
lascars
come
about
us
you
know
what
to
do
but
i
fear
not
the
potail
will
help
us
and
hittah
singh
too
and
there
need
be
no
great
noise
my
father
will
have
to
personate
the
moonshee
for
a
while
if
necessary
but
that
does
not
matter
good
said
ganesha
but
be
quick
meer
sahib
i
shall
be
in
a
torment
of
apprehension
until
the
whole
are
fairly
under
the
ground
i
left
him
and
carelessly
playing
with
my
roomal
again
entered
the
tent
what
is
it
asked
the
moonshee
oh
nothing
i
replied
only
some
tents
which
have
arrived
their
servants
wanted
this
ground
to
encamp
on
but
seeing
us
here
the
lascars
have
taken
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
village
the
troops
will
be
here
early
that
will
suit
me
exactly
said
he
i
will
stay
with
them
and
bid
you
gentlemen
farewell
but
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
be
the
less
merry
i
warrant
these
good
fellows
have
another
song
or
two
in
store
have
you
he
asked
of
them
a
hundred
replied
one
of
them
but
perhaps
the
next
will
be
rather
a
noisy
one
never
mind
said
he
play
on
you
shall
have
as
good
a
reward
as
i
can
afford
to
bestow
i
waited
till
the
noise
was
at
its
height
to
give
the
jhirnee
yet
i
had
not
the
opportunity
i
wished
for
the
moonshee
sat
with
his
back
to
the
kanât
and
to
get
behind
him
was
impossible
one
of
the
thugs
saw
my
embarrassment
and
relieved
it
by
begging
him
to
rise
and
advance
a
few
paces
what
are
they
going
to
do
asked
he
i
know
not
i
replied
but
you
had
as
well
comply
he
arose
and
i
slipped
behind
him
now
i
shouted
bring
the
pan
and
my
hand
was
on
the
moonshee
neck
one
wild
shriek
he
gave
and
fell
his
wife
had
been
looking
on
through
a
hole
in
the
kanât
she
had
seen
the
work
and
rushed
out
into
the
midst
of
us
with
her
boy
in
her
arms
i
shall
never
forget
her
never
i
shall
never
forget
her
wild
look
and
her
screams
i
tore
the
boy
from
her
arms
and
left
her
in
the
midst
of
the
thugs
i
ran
out
into
the
air
and
the
first
person
i
met
was
ganesha
his
face
flushed
with
triumph
which
i
saw
by
the
glare
of
the
torches
from
the
tent
all
is
done
cried
he
they
have
all
fallen
two
i
killed
myself
where
are
the
lughaees
we
must
be
quick
he
ran
on
and
i
stood
in
the
open
space
before
the
tent
parties
of
thugs
passed
rapidly
to
and
fro
bearing
the
bodies
of
the
dead
which
were
one
by
one
thrown
into
the
hole
but
the
singing
and
music
went
on
as
merrily
as
ever
and
looking
into
the
tent
i
saw
my
father
sitting
in
the
place
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
moonshee
my
little
charge
was
crying
terribly
imploring
me
in
tones
and
words
that
would
have
moved
any
one
heart
but
mine
to
take
him
to
his
mother
i
soothed
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
was
going
to
my
tent
but
curiosity
impelled
me
to
return
and
see
the
hole
in
which
the
business
of
interment
was
going
on
i
went
to
the
edge
ganesha
was
standing
by
it
encouraging
the
lughaees
he
saw
the
boy
in
my
arms
what
folly
is
this
meer
sahib
said
he
you
are
not
going
to
spare
that
boy
when
we
are
even
now
in
such
danger
it
will
be
madness
give
him
to
me
i
will
silence
the
crying
wretch
and
send
him
with
his
parents
never
cried
i
the
boy
is
mine
you
may
have
all
the
spoil
but
give
him
up
to
death
i
will
not
have
i
not
lost
a
son
and
is
it
not
lawful
to
adopt
a
child
of
this
age
madness
madness
cried
ganesha
the
boy
must
die
are
you
a
fool
meer
sahib
to
risk
such
a
chance
he
will
never
find
out
the
difference
between
us
and
his
parents
said
i
and
i
will
not
be
interfered
with
fool
said
ganesha
setting
his
teeth
i
spared
a
child
once
and
will
never
spare
another
i
have
sworn
it
on
the
pickaxe
i
care
not
for
a
thousand
oaths
i
cried
the
boy
is
mine
and
you
had
better
not
oppose
me
if
you
wish
to
avoid
a
quarrel
and
i
was
going
away
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
let
me
go
i
exclaimed
and
i
felt
for
my
dagger
or
by
alla
i
will
strike
this
steel
into
you
boy
cried
he
you
are
mad
i
fear
you
not
talk
of
daggers
to
others
than
ganesha
he
has
seen
too
much
of
you
to
fear
you
give
me
the
child
i
say
his
very
cries
will
alarm
the
sepoys
i
felt
for
my
dagger
or
sword
but
i
had
left
them
in
the
tent
i
tried
if
pity
could
move
him
have
you
no
compassion
i
said
more
gently
ganesha
have
you
no
pity
for
a
child
can
you
bear
to
kill
him
i
was
off
my
guard
and
he
saw
his
opportunity
quicker
than
thought
he
had
rudely
snatched
the
child
from
my
arms
and
as
he
hurled
him
into
the
pit
he
cried
scornfully
pity
no
i
know
it
not
now
go
and
cry
meer
sahib
for
the
loss
of
your
plaything
i
started
forward
and
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
hole
which
was
being
rapidly
filled
the
poor
boy
lay
senseless
and
dead
at
the
bottom
one
shriek
alone
had
escaped
him
as
he
was
dashed
with
passionate
force
into
it
i
gazed
for
an
instant
to
satisfy
myself
that
he
was
dead
and
some
of
the
earth
which
was
being
thrown
in
hid
him
almost
instantly
from
my
view
i
turned
to
ganesha
in
savage
anger
dog
cried
i
and
son
of
a
dog
you
shall
answer
for
this
had
i
my
sword
now
with
me
i
would
cut
you
in
two
pieces
an
idle
threat
and
one
befitting
what
i
have
heard
of
you
said
he
go
meer
sahib
you
are
a
boy
and
a
fool
i
do
not
fear
you
villain
he
had
destroyed
my
son
situated
as
i
was
i
could
then
do
nothing
but
i
was
determined
to
have
my
revenge
and
i
took
it
too
i
mentioned
what
had
occurred
to
my
father
and
to
three
of
my
intimate
associates
they
were
determined
to
stick
by
me
whenever
i
chose
to
attack
ganesha
and
would
fain
have
done
so
the
next
day
but
this
did
not
suit
me
though
his
words
rankled
in
my
heart
and
the
deed
he
had
done
made
me
hate
him
more
than
ever
i
deferred
my
revenge
to
the
last
moment
but
i
took
it
as
you
shall
hear
we
stayed
on
the
ground
that
night
the
palankeen
had
been
broken
in
pieces
and
thrown
into
the
hole
but
my
father
personated
the
moonshee
the
next
morning
as
we
rode
through
the
camp
of
the
feringhees
which
had
been
pitched
so
near
us
that
indeed
i
have
often
wondered
they
heard
not
the
cries
of
the
party
as
we
despatched
them
but
we
had
taken
good
precautions
the
noise
of
the
drums
and
the
confusion
occasioned
by
letting
loose
two
of
the
moonshee
horses
which
were
here
and
there
pursued
by
a
number
of
thugs
shouting
and
screaming
after
them
had
drowned
the
cries
of
our
victims
and
we
had
effected
the
whole
without
suspicion
our
good
friends
the
potail
and
the
duffadar
had
kept
the
sepoys
in
conversation
and
they
had
not
noticed
the
noise
beyond
hazarding
a
passing
remark
as
to
its
cause
again
therefore
we
were
on
the
road
we
had
not
got
all
the
booty
we
expected
it
did
not
indeed
amount
to
three
thousand
rupees
and
we
earnestly
looked
out
for
the
dacoos
who
were
we
hoped
to
be
our
next
bunij
we
went
on
to
nagpoor
and
sold
the
moonshee
camels
and
horses
here
the
gang
divided
one
part
under
a
jemadar
named
emom
buksh
took
our
old
road
towards
oomraotee
and
through
the
valley
of
berar
to
khândésh
and
boorhanpoor
the
rest
of
us
returned
by
the
road
we
had
come
after
staying
four
days
in
the
city
of
nagpoor
on
our
second
or
third
march
homewards
we
overtook
the
dacoos
they
had
been
seen
by
our
spies
the
moment
we
entered
the
village
we
had
encamped
at
and
as
much
caution
was
requisite
in
managing
them
my
father
at
once
proposed
to
be
alone
the
sotha
or
inveigler
i
shall
feign
to
be
a
hindoo
said
he
these
rascals
will
suspect
me
if
i
go
by
my
own
name
and
indeed
they
would
know
me
i
will
be
a
rajpoot
jemadar
come
from
hyderabad
and
you
shall
see
i
have
not
forgotten
my
old
trade
accordingly
he
painted
his
forehead
and
breast
after
the
fashion
of
the
hindoos
covered
his
eyes
with
wood
ashes
put
on
a
waistcloth
and
dress
he
borrowed
from
one
of
the
men
and
attended
by
another
went
into
the
village
how
anxiously
i
expected
his
return
i
feared
he
would
fail
in
his
mission
but
ganesha
was
confident
he
never
fails
said
he
to
me
he
is
one
of
bhowanee
own
favourites
nothing
he
ever
did
failed
would
that
i
had
his
luck
but
he
was
absent
so
long
that
i
became
apprehensive
for
his
safety
and
was
on
the
point
of
setting
out
to
gain
tidings
of
him
when
to
my
great
joy
i
saw
him
approaching
i
ran
to
meet
him
what
news
cried
i
oh
my
father
my
liver
has
been
burnt
during
your
absence
why
did
you
stay
so
long
never
mind
my
son
said
he
when
he
had
dismounted
you
would
have
been
wrong
to
come
after
me
but
ah
the
owls
i
have
entrapped
them
they
are
ours
cried
i
this
is
rare
news
but
how
did
you
manage
it
why
replied
he
it
was
done
easily
enough
though
i
feared
for
my
success
when
i
saw
that
one
of
the
dacoos
was
a
fellow
i
had
known
a
long
time
ago
however
he
did
not
recognize
me
thanks
to
my
white
beard
and
these
marks
of
the
infidels
he
never
thought
i
was
ismail
thug
i
sat
and
conversed
with
their
leader
who
told
me
very
gravely
he
was
a
servant
of
the
english
going
to
hindostan
on
leave
of
absence
i
said
i
was
one
also
and
had
come
from
jalna
where
i
was
a
collector
of
duties
on
spirits
we
then
became
intimate
and
the
upshot
of
the
whole
was
that
we
agreed
to
travel
together
and
by
alla
if
the
omens
are
good
they
shall
die
delay
is
useless
with
these
fellows
for
they
evidently
think
from
the
signs
i
saw
them
making
among
themselves
which
are
known
to
me
that
we
are
certain
bunij
to
them
and
if
we
do
not
attack
them
they
will
fall
upon
us
we
shall
need
good
hands
said
i
and
i
will
take
the
leader
i
will
be
a
bhuttote
also
said
ganesha
i
never
killed
a
dacoo
are
they
stout
fellows
very
answered
my
father
but
like
all
their
tribe
they
are
heavily
armed
and
can
do
but
little
against
us
if
we
manage
properly
we
had
better
fall
on
them
with
our
swords
i
observed
not
so
my
son
but
we
will
surround
them
and
if
there
is
not
a
good
opportunity
the
men
can
use
their
weapons
we
were
soon
agreed
on
this
point
and
in
the
morning
the
dacoos
joined
us
as
we
moved
round
the
village
into
the
main
road
they
were
in
number
stout
but
men
armed
to
the
teeth
with
their
heads
enveloped
in
folds
of
cloth
they
had
with
them
thirteen
tattoos
heavily
laden
and
it
was
well
that
they
had
this
encumbrance
as
it
served
to
separate
them
as
each
tattoo
required
a
man
to
drive
it
had
they
kept
in
a
body
we
could
have
made
but
little
impression
on
them
and
dared
hardly
to
have
attacked
them
now
look
out
said
my
father
to
the
men
if
you
see
them
leaving
their
beasts
and
collecting
in
two
and
threes
fall
on
them
at
once
or
they
will
attack
us
they
know
well
enough
who
we
are
though
they
pretend
they
do
not
we
journeyed
on
in
company
after
i
had
ridden
for
some
distance
i
dismounted
and
walking
beside
the
leader
i
entered
into
conversation
with
him
he
did
not
recognize
me
in
the
least
and
very
gravely
began
telling
me
how
he
had
met
with
thugs
on
his
way
down
how
he
had
fought
with
and
overpowered
a
large
band
and
carried
off
their
plunder
amounting
to
some
thousand
rupees
i
could
have
struck
him
on
the
mouth
with
my
shoe
but
i
refrained
yet
it
was
enough
to
have
provoked
me
being
so
barefaced
a
lie
still
i
applauded
his
bravery
and
he
continued
yes
meer
sahib
these
thugs
are
the
greatest
villains
unhung
and
i
praise
the
prophet
that
i
have
gained
some
information
about
them
which
i
will
give
to
my
masters
the
europeans
the
fool
of
a
thug
or
rather
one
of
his
people
told
me
they
belonged
to
jhalone
i
am
going
that
way
and
if
i
do
not
tell
the
rajah
of
their
being
in
his
city
call
me
an
owl
and
a
father
of
jackasses
i
expect
too
he
will
reward
me
handsomely
ay
you
will
tell
him
thought
i
but
you
must
get
there
first
my
friend
mashalla
words
are
one
thing
but
deeds
are
another
and
were
they
such
fools
i
asked
all
the
world
say
that
thugs
are
never
to
be
taken
in
the
fellow
laughed
scornfully
never
taken
in
said
he
did
not
i
deceive
them
they
are
swine
they
are
asses
they
murder
poor
travellers
but
they
have
no
wit
not
so
much
as
children
their
fool
of
a
jemadar
tried
to
deceive
me
by
wrapping
his
face
in
a
cloth
but
i
saw
him
dark
as
it
was
and
could
swear
to
him
among
a
thousand
what
was
he
like
inquired
i
i
am
curious
to
know
if
it
were
only
to
avoid
him
in
future
especially
as
i
am
a
constant
traveller
on
this
road
but
you
said
you
attacked
them
yes
said
he
i
am
an
old
traveller
too
and
as
we
were
a
large
body
and
the
thugs
not
more
than
treble
our
number
i
said
to
my
companions
that
though
i
knew
we
were
with
thugs
they
ought
not
to
fear
and
if
they
would
only
watch
me
we
might
attack
and
disperse
them
and
get
their
plunder
and
by
alla
we
did
sahib
late
at
night
we
rose
on
them
killed
some
and
the
rest
ran
away
among
them
the
cowardly
jemadar
we
got
enough
too
to
take
us
to
hyderabad
comfortably
so
we
had
a
narrow
escape
thought
i
these
fellows
would
have
attacked
us
i
doubt
not
had
we
not
gone
on
that
night
but
the
lie
sahib
was
it
not
an
impudent
one
yet
i
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
his
relation
which
he
swore
was
true
by
alla
and
the
prophet
by
my
beard
and
by
every
saint
in
his
calendar
we
trudged
on
till
we
came
in
sight
of
two
trees
on
the
road
on
which
travellers
hung
bits
of
rag
as
offerings
to
the
guardian
saint
of
the
place
i
saw
very
plainly
that
this
was
their
bhil
one
by
one
they
began
to
forsake
their
tattoos
and
collect
more
delay
on
our
part
would
have
been
fatal
and
my
father
saw
this
he
was
as
prompt
as
i
could
have
desired
he
had
seen
their
movements
and
just
as
i
had
disengaged
my
roomal
from
my
waist
he
gave
the
jhirnee
eleven
of
the
dacoos
fell
at
the
same
moment
the
leader
by
my
hand
i
had
my
roomal
round
his
throat
and
before
i
gave
the
fatal
wrench
i
shouted
in
his
ear
that
i
was
ameer
ali
the
leader
of
the
thugs
he
had
met
and
that
i
had
sworn
to
kill
him
and
had
done
it
the
rest
were
cut
down
with
swords
my
men
were
prepared
they
were
not
and
were
heavily
encumbered
yet
had
we
delayed
for
another
three
or
four
hundred
paces
they
would
have
fallen
upon
us
and
i
think
sahib
the
thugs
would
have
run
away
as
it
was
however
we
were
victorious
we
threw
the
bodies
as
they
were
into
the
jungle
and
pushed
on
laughing
heartily
and
in
the
highest
spirits
at
the
issue
of
our
adventure
the
booty
too
was
good
thirteen
thousand
rupees
worth
of
gold
silver
and
ready
money
met
our
admiring
eyes
when
the
packages
of
the
loaded
tattoos
were
opened
for
our
inspection
well
sahib
we
had
proceeded
as
far
as
sehora
on
our
return
when
we
fell
in
with
a
great
european
who
was
also
travelling
we
did
not
fear
him
but
on
the
contrary
determined
to
keep
with
him
because
we
well
knew
that
he
had
many
travellers
in
his
train
who
profited
by
the
protection
of
his
troops
so
we
divided
into
two
parties
one
under
myself
and
my
father
the
other
under
ganesha
our
object
was
to
separate
the
travellers
from
him
and
we
hoped
by
representing
the
inconvenience
they
were
put
to
by
delay
on
account
of
his
slow
marches
and
the
scarcity
of
provisions
they
would
experience
on
the
road
to
induce
them
to
accompany
us
i
need
not
follow
the
adventure
further
for
it
differed
not
from
the
rest
suffice
it
to
say
that
after
a
few
marches
a
large
party
of
travellers
had
joined
with
us
we
left
the
to
proceed
by
footpaths
through
the
jungles
and
near
the
village
of
shirkarpoor
we
selected
the
bhil
the
place
was
a
favourite
one
and
well
known
to
our
party
the
travellers
fell
men
some
women
and
children
all
were
buried
in
one
grave
for
the
spot
where
they
were
killed
was
a
desolate
one
the
deed
was
done
in
the
night
but
by
the
light
of
as
fair
a
moon
as
ever
shone
on
us
one
child
i
saved
from
the
general
slaughter
ganesha
was
not
present
to
oppose
me
and
though
the
boy
was
a
hindoo
yet
i
determined
to
adopt
him
as
my
own
and
to
bring
him
up
in
the
holy
faith
i
professed
myself
and
this
would
enhance
the
merit
of
having
spared
him
but
when
his
mother
died
i
could
not
force
him
away
from
the
body
he
clung
to
it
young
as
he
was
with
frantic
force
he
screamed
and
kicked
whenever
i
attempted
to
lay
hold
of
him
and
bit
me
in
the
arms
and
the
hands
i
thought
if
the
body
was
removed
from
his
sight
he
would
be
quiet
and
submit
to
his
fate
but
no
when
it
was
gone
he
grew
worse
and
worse
nothing
would
pacify
or
tranquillize
him
and
i
fairly
grew
impatient
and
angry
i
drew
my
sword
and
threatened
him
but
he
was
insensible
to
his
danger
he
reviled
me
he
spat
at
me
with
a
virulence
i
once
more
raised
him
up
in
my
arms
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
seized
my
ear
in
his
teeth
and
bit
it
till
the
blood
came
in
the
agony
of
the
pain
and
in
my
rage
i
knew
not
what
i
did
sahib
how
shall
i
tell
you
what
followed
it
was
the
worst
act
of
my
life
but
one
which
i
have
yet
to
tell
you
of
you
killed
him
i
suppose
ameer
ali
said
i
yes
sahib
i
killed
him
but
oh
how
did
i
do
it
it
was
the
work
not
mine
i
never
was
cruel
but
now
the
shitan
possessed
me
here
ameer
ali
put
his
hands
to
his
eyes
and
finding
my
heart
sicken
i
begged
him
to
refrain
from
reciting
the
dreadful
particulars
after
a
pause
he
continued
wretch
that
i
was
i
did
this
no
one
was
near
me
but
the
thug
who
held
my
horse
and
even
he
was
and
uttered
a
loud
scream
of
terror
i
silenced
him
and
leaving
the
mangled
body
i
mounted
my
horse
and
galloped
after
my
party
yes
sahib
i
deserved
to
be
hanged
for
that
deed
had
i
never
done
another
but
i
was
spared
for
a
different
fate
we
were
in
full
march
on
the
third
day
after
this
happened
when
we
saw
a
body
of
horsemen
coming
after
us
my
mind
misgave
me
when
i
observed
them
and
i
hastened
to
collect
the
straggling
thugs
and
form
them
into
a
close
body
in
case
the
horsemen
should
prove
to
be
enemies
or
make
any
hostile
demonstration
on
they
came
shouting
and
abusing
us
in
every
term
of
vile
reproach
their
tongues
could
utter
there
were
about
forty
of
them
and
i
verily
believe
that
had
i
not
been
at
the
head
of
the
band
they
would
have
fled
as
one
man
however
i
cheered
them
up
and
was
determined
to
show
a
good
front
in
my
retreat
i
knew
there
was
a
village
in
our
interest
within
a
few
coss
which
possessed
a
worthy
potail
like
him
i
have
told
you
of
and
that
if
we
could
but
reach
it
we
might
man
the
walls
and
towers
and
bid
defiance
to
our
pursuers
be
not
afraid
cried
i
to
my
men
let
the
best
of
ye
come
behind
with
me
and
we
will
stop
these
marauding
rascals
i
know
they
are
pindharees
and
the
veriest
cowards
in
existence
only
be
firm
you
who
have
matchlocks
take
good
aim
and
when
they
are
near
enough
every
one
mark
his
man
and
see
if
as
many
saddles
are
not
emptied
on
they
came
fortunately
the
road
was
narrow
and
had
thick
thorny
brushwood
on
each
side
of
it
so
that
they
could
not
pass
us
they
were
within
speaking
distance
and
i
shouted
are
ye
friends
or
enemies
if
the
former
keep
behind
us
if
enemies
begone
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
my
friends
or
ye
are
likely
to
get
a
sharp
reception
stop
shouted
the
leader
of
the
party
who
among
you
is
leader
i
would
speak
to
him
i
am
leader
said
i
come
out
alone
and
i
will
meet
you
but
if
any
of
ye
stir
by
alla
we
will
fire
on
you
the
fellow
advanced
and
seeing
that
none
followed
him
i
rode
out
in
front
of
my
men
if
there
is
treachery
said
i
to
them
fire
never
mind
me
jemadar
said
the
man
our
thakoor
has
sent
for
you
you
may
possibly
have
guessed
why
you
had
better
come
you
will
only
have
to
pay
a
fine
and
will
be
released
i
swear
this
to
you
on
the
faith
of
a
rajpoot
i
will
neither
trust
you
nor
your
master
said
i
you
are
a
parcel
of
vagabond
pindharees
i
laugh
at
you
and
spit
on
your
beards
if
you
want
us
come
and
take
us
but
of
our
own
accord
we
come
not
are
we
fools
are
we
asses
oh
man
art
one
to
talk
thus
go
back
to
him
that
sent
thee
and
say
the
man
is
yet
unborn
who
will
take
ameer
ali
thug
so
long
as
he
has
a
weapon
in
his
hand
or
a
few
gallant
fellows
by
his
side
have
you
no
shame
to
deliver
such
a
message
he
made
no
answer
but
urged
his
horse
and
cut
at
me
with
his
sword
fool
he
did
not
think
that
a
thug
could
fight
and
still
less
that
he
had
engaged
one
whom
no
one
had
ever
yet
defeated
i
caught
the
blow
on
my
shield
and
returned
it
on
his
head
as
he
passed
me
the
fellow
fell
front
his
horse
a
dead
man
my
own
men
set
up
a
shout
and
discharged
their
matchlocks
one
horseman
and
a
horse
fell
wounded
and
struggled
in
the
dust
had
only
my
own
good
companions
in
the
pindharee
affairs
been
with
me
i
would
have
charged
them
and
put
them
to
flight
but
i
could
do
nothing
alone
we
had
checked
them
however
and
retired
slowly
followed
by
the
troop
who
kept
out
of
shot
but
evidently
waiting
for
a
piece
of
level
and
fair
ground
to
charge
us
in
this
way
we
retreated
till
the
welcome
walls
of
the
village
whither
i
had
directed
the
main
body
appeared
to
our
view
we
redoubled
our
efforts
to
gain
the
shelter
they
would
afford
us
and
the
men
were
in
some
disorder
as
we
passed
over
a
level
plain
in
front
of
the
village
they
were
even
beginning
to
run
but
i
checked
them
for
the
love
of
alla
cried
i
for
your
own
sakes
keep
together
and
have
brave
hearts
so
long
as
we
are
firm
they
will
not
dare
to
come
near
us
but
if
once
we
separate
we
are
lost
see
even
now
they
are
preparing
to
charge
as
a
hawk
stoops
on
his
quarry
and
down
they
came
thundering
along
brandishing
their
spears
and
reviling
us
some
of
my
men
fled
at
their
utmost
speed
to
the
gate
but
most
of
them
stood
again
i
dashed
at
one
of
our
enemies
and
wounded
him
but
the
odds
were
against
us
one
of
my
own
men
fell
pierced
through
the
breast
to
the
backbone
by
a
spear
another
was
wounded
but
they
could
not
take
further
advantage
of
us
those
who
had
fled
joined
by
others
of
my
men
and
some
villagers
headed
by
my
brave
old
father
issued
from
the
gate
which
the
horsemen
seeing
they
drew
off
and
we
got
within
the
village
in
safety
they
kept
hovering
about
till
but
out
of
the
reach
of
our
shot
and
soon
after
noon
they
all
departed
and
we
saw
no
more
of
them
we
had
to
pay
for
our
shelter
handsomely
however
for
the
potail
shut
the
gates
of
his
village
and
declared
we
should
not
pass
out
without
having
paid
him
a
thousand
rupees
i
was
for
attacking
him
plundering
his
village
and
burning
it
after
the
pindharee
fashion
and
we
could
have
done
it
easily
but
my
father
would
not
hear
of
it
the
country
would
rise
on
us
he
said
and
besides
it
would
ill
requite
the
potail
hospitality
and
protection
even
though
we
had
to
pay
for
it
so
he
paid
the
money
and
after
a
thousand
protestations
of
mutual
goodwill
we
left
the
village
in
the
evening
intending
to
push
on
as
far
as
we
could
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
pursuit
nor
were
we
followed
though
this
exploit
made
a
noise
in
the
country
and
was
known
far
and
wide
we
were
not
molested
we
heard
afterwards
that
the
thakoor
flew
into
a
furious
passion
when
he
heard
of
his
defeat
and
dismissed
them
from
his
service
as
a
parcel
of
cowards
as
indeed
they
were
moreover
he
swore
he
would
be
revenged
upon
every
thug
he
might
ever
catch
afterwards
and
i
believe
he
kept
his
word
and
put
some
to
death
but
we
laughed
at
his
beard
and
many
a
merry
jest
had
we
over
the
adventure
afterwards
it
seems
the
day
after
some
herdsmen
were
passing
the
spot
where
the
travellers
had
been
killed
and
they
saw
the
body
of
the
lad
lying
in
the
road
all
the
remains
were
discovered
and
information
was
given
to
the
ruler
of
the
village
and
tract
of
country
in
which
the
deed
had
been
done
we
pursued
our
route
ganesha
too
had
been
fortunate
he
had
decoyed
a
large
body
of
travellers
consisting
of
a
jemadar
who
had
lost
an
arm
and
his
family
with
some
others
along
the
in
another
direction
and
he
had
killed
them
all
you
know
sahib
that
it
is
forbidden
to
us
to
kill
persons
who
may
in
any
way
be
deformed
i
was
amused
afterwards
to
hear
the
accounts
which
were
given
of
the
deliberations
made
upon
the
jemadar
fate
by
ganesha
and
his
gang
he
told
them
to
me
himself
when
we
met
some
indeed
most
of
the
men
said
he
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
should
be
strangled
or
not
there
was
no
means
of
separating
him
from
the
party
and
they
said
the
whole
ought
to
be
abandoned
on
his
account
as
he
had
lost
an
arm
and
therefore
was
not
a
fit
sacrifice
to
bhowanee
i
replied
that
he
was
not
deformed
that
if
he
had
lost
an
arm
he
had
had
one
once
and
the
losing
of
it
was
not
the
work
of
alla
but
of
man
and
that
when
he
died
he
would
appear
in
the
form
in
which
he
had
been
created
therefore
he
was
not
forbidden
but
was
true
bunij
and
i
asked
them
how
they
would
show
their
faces
to
you
and
to
their
brethren
at
the
rendezvous
with
no
deed
to
boast
of
and
more
than
all
no
plunder
i
prevailed
the
whole
were
strangled
the
jemadar
by
my
own
hand
for
no
one
else
would
touch
him
despite
of
all
i
said
to
convince
them
there
was
no
harm
in
it
the
worst
of
all
was
however
that
there
were
two
young
girls
of
a
marriageable
age
the
daughters
of
the
jemadar
two
of
my
men
took
a
fancy
to
them
and
would
fain
have
carried
them
off
to
be
their
wives
but
they
would
not
consent
and
they
were
strangled
with
the
rest
we
were
now
somewhat
at
a
loss
for
a
route
or
whither
to
go
the
omens
were
consulted
at
saugor
which
was
our
place
of
rendezvous
and
as
they
pointed
to
the
northward
we
struck
off
the
to
the
north
at
saugor
and
took
that
to
seronje
but
my
father
returned
to
jhalone
we
divided
into
two
bodies
each
a
day
march
from
the
other
for
we
were
fearful
of
being
suspected
if
we
travelled
in
large
numbers
and
since
the
europeans
had
got
a
footing
in
the
country
we
found
that
we
were
asked
more
questions
at
the
different
posts
and
guards
than
we
had
used
to
be
besides
large
bodies
of
travellers
had
disappeared
in
various
directions
by
the
hands
of
other
bands
of
thugs
and
the
authorities
were
suspicious
and
inquisitive
to
a
degree
however
now
with
bullying
now
with
bribes
we
contrived
to
pass
on
leaving
our
fruit
as
we
went
in
many
a
sly
place
which
the
choukedars
never
suspected
and
although
we
got
no
large
booty
yet
scarcely
a
day
passed
but
one
two
or
more
travellers
met
their
death
at
our
hands
it
was
at
the
village
of
ekléra
in
holkar
dominions
alas
i
shall
never
forget
it
that
our
sothas
brought
us
word
they
had
secured
a
small
party
of
travellers
who
they
had
heard
were
about
to
proceed
to
a
village
a
few
coss
distant
of
course
our
men
told
them
of
the
danger
of
travelling
alone
of
the
alarms
there
were
of
thugs
and
begged
of
them
to
accompany
our
large
party
for
safety
which
had
collected
for
the
same
purpose
and
they
consented
the
sothas
offered
to
introduce
them
to
me
as
the
leader
of
the
kafila
and
accordingly
at
sunset
one
of
them
returned
to
the
bazar
and
brought
two
of
the
men
to
me
i
received
them
cordially
repeated
the
same
stories
as
my
men
had
done
and
frightened
them
quite
sufficiently
for
my
purpose
listen
said
one
though
i
have
never
seen
a
thug
nor
know
of
any
existing
in
this
part
yet
that
they
have
been
here
there
is
no
doubt
my
wife
father
was
killed
by
them
how
said
i
it
is
horrible
to
think
on
how
did
this
happen
know
you
aught
of
the
particulars
no
replied
he
none
but
what
i
have
heard
from
others
i
was
a
boy
at
the
time
but
the
old
men
of
the
village
know
them
well
and
often
speak
of
them
even
to
this
day
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
as
i
justly
call
him
and
he
shall
tell
you
the
tale
himself
mashalla
he
tells
it
with
much
spirit
and
is
worth
hearing
i
confess
i
was
interested
why
i
should
have
been
so
at
a
common
tale
of
thuggee
was
more
than
i
can
imagine
i
rose
and
followed
the
man
to
his
house
determined
to
hear
the
whole
story
from
his
mouth
i
have
said
it
was
yet
day
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
village
was
a
scene
of
bustle
and
noise
as
is
always
the
case
in
an
evening
the
herds
which
had
been
out
to
graze
were
pouring
in
at
the
gates
raising
clouds
of
dust
through
which
the
walls
were
but
dimly
seen
yet
still
as
i
advanced
i
fancied
them
familiar
to
me
i
imagined
i
knew
the
names
of
different
places
near
them
one
in
particular
the
abode
of
a
fakeer
around
which
was
a
small
garden
i
almost
started
when
i
approached
it
for
it
seemed
like
the
face
of
a
familiar
friend
one
meets
after
a
long
long
absence
when
one
hesitates
to
accost
him
by
name
though
almost
assured
of
his
identity
but
in
spite
of
my
desire
to
know
the
name
of
the
garden
i
walked
on
for
it
would
not
have
suited
my
purpose
to
have
appeared
to
recognize
any
object
having
represented
myself
to
be
an
utter
stranger
as
we
passed
through
the
gate
objects
more
and
more
familiar
to
my
eyes
presented
themselves
the
bazar
the
little
mosque
the
kotwal
chowree
the
temple
of
mahadeo
i
could
have
named
them
all
and
one
house
in
particular
my
heart
leaped
within
me
as
i
passed
it
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
it
but
it
seemed
unaccountably
fresh
to
me
as
though
i
had
but
left
it
yesterday
still
i
walked
on
silently
and
my
companion
did
not
notice
the
agitation
and
surprise
which
must
have
been
depicted
on
my
features
we
reached
the
house
a
respectable
one
in
appearance
and
desiring
me
to
be
seated
he
left
me
to
bring
the
old
man
of
whom
we
had
spoken
when
we
entered
alla
alla
i
could
have
called
him
too
by
name
though
his
features
were
shrunken
and
withered
i
was
almost
about
to
exclaim
rheim
khan
but
i
checked
myself
and
as
he
was
presented
to
me
under
another
name
futih
mahomed
khan
i
was
silent
the
whole
after
this
thought
i
must
be
a
wild
dream
or
i
may
have
visited
the
place
in
my
wanderings
perhaps
stayed
a
few
days
at
it
and
it
is
thus
familiar
to
me
after
some
desultory
conversation
my
new
friend
stated
what
he
had
told
me
and
requested
his
to
relate
the
story
of
peer
khan
with
all
its
particulars
chapter
xliii
the
old
man
returned
my
salutations
cordially
and
when
we
were
fairly
seated
and
the
hookah
had
passed
round
he
related
the
sad
history
of
the
parents
of
the
girl
he
had
adopted
his
version
of
the
tale
differed
little
from
that
of
my
new
acquaintance
and
indeed
the
whole
affair
appeared
to
have
been
as
successful
a
piece
of
thuggee
as
i
had
ever
listened
to
i
wonder
who
they
were
thought
i
i
will
mention
the
story
to
my
father
perhaps
he
may
have
heard
of
it
and
can
give
me
some
clue
to
the
boy
whose
fate
is
buried
in
uncertainty
yet
the
lad
may
even
now
be
among
us
and
as
this
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
a
half
conviction
forced
itself
upon
me
that
i
was
the
man
but
i
checked
it
it
was
a
foolish
thought
such
as
one
harbours
sometimes
upon
the
slightest
cause
and
dismisses
after
a
moment
reflection
and
you
never
heard
aught
of
them
afterwards
nor
of
the
boy
i
asked
never
said
the
old
man
never
years
have
passed
since
then
and
the
lad
if
he
lives
is
about
your
own
age
meer
sahib
and
ya
alla
cried
he
gazing
on
me
as
a
gust
of
wind
caused
the
lamp
to
flare
towards
me
those
features
are
familiar
to
me
speak
man
thou
art
not
the
son
of
him
who
was
murdered
i
confess
that
his
earnest
gaze
and
manner
with
my
previous
convictions
that
the
village
was
familiar
to
me
almost
overpowered
me
but
i
was
too
old
an
adept
in
deceit
to
be
long
staggered
by
a
suspicion
which
he
had
no
means
of
confirming
and
i
replied
carelessly
and
with
a
laugh
no
no
that
can
not
be
my
father
still
lives
though
my
mother
is
dead
indeed
i
have
but
little
remembrance
of
her
besides
we
are
pure
syuds
by
descent
and
reside
in
a
distant
country
and
you
spoke
of
your
old
friend
as
a
pathan
it
can
not
be
then
said
the
old
man
turning
away
with
an
air
of
disappointment
yet
the
resemblance
is
very
striking
and
i
pray
you
meer
sahib
to
pardon
an
old
man
mistake
it
may
be
that
my
eyes
are
failing
me
yet
look
at
him
my
son
and
say
does
he
not
resemble
he
does
so
certainly
replied
the
other
and
i
was
struck
with
the
similarity
of
features
when
i
first
saw
him
but
it
must
be
imaginary
or
it
is
perhaps
one
of
those
unaccountable
resemblances
which
one
often
sees
without
being
able
to
discover
any
cause
why
it
should
exist
but
you
spoke
of
a
coin
said
i
which
you
hold
to
be
possessed
of
peculiar
virtues
i
did
meer
sahib
and
my
father
will
tell
you
that
i
have
not
overrated
its
efficacy
nor
has
he
said
the
other
many
charms
have
i
seen
but
none
equal
to
it
when
around
the
neck
of
the
wearer
no
evil
comes
to
her
no
disease
attacks
her
and
the
eye
of
the
malevolent
or
envious
rests
in
vain
upon
her
assuredly
it
possesses
wonderful
virtues
for
if
it
is
ever
absent
from
her
she
suffers
from
disease
or
is
unquiet
in
mind
alla
ke
qoodrut
i
exclaimed
it
is
the
work
of
god
such
charms
are
indeed
precious
and
lucky
is
the
possessor
of
them
i
had
once
a
son
he
became
the
victim
of
an
evil
glance
cast
by
a
fakeer
to
whom
alms
were
denied
he
cursed
my
house
and
the
boy
pined
and
died
i
was
absent
from
my
home
and
you
may
judge
sirs
of
my
agony
when
i
arrived
and
learned
my
boy
was
dead
i
have
never
been
blessed
with
another
but
a
girl
still
survives
upon
whom
every
care
is
lavished
and
no
charm
is
offered
for
sale
by
the
wandering
fakeers
moslem
or
hindoo
but
it
is
eagerly
purchased
and
hung
around
her
neck
in
this
manner
i
have
spent
much
money
but
as
yet
without
effect
for
my
child
is
delicate
and
afflicted
with
dreams
which
disturb
her
rest
and
disquiet
her
gentle
spirit
and
i
would
to
alla
i
could
become
the
possessor
of
some
charm
similar
to
the
one
you
mention
keep
a
stout
heart
meer
sahib
said
the
old
man
you
have
bought
your
experience
with
sorrow
to
be
sure
yet
a
constant
attention
to
the
wants
of
the
holy
wanderers
will
no
doubt
have
its
effect
in
the
end
and
their
prayers
will
be
offered
for
the
health
of
your
child
and
her
long
life
may
alla
listen
to
them
said
i
fervently
for
my
heart
was
then
with
my
child
and
my
loved
wife
i
arose
to
take
my
leave
and
as
my
new
friend
insisted
on
accompanying
me
to
our
camp
we
walked
thither
you
will
be
ready
then
at
the
first
dawn
observed
i
we
travel
early
for
the
sake
of
the
cool
morning
air
and
my
companions
bestir
themselves
as
soon
as
the
first
blush
of
light
spreads
over
the
east
depend
on
me
said
he
i
will
not
keep
you
waiting
we
have
a
long
stage
before
us
he
left
me
i
will
have
the
charm
thought
i
as
i
lay
down
to
rest
my
child
shall
be
protected
by
its
extraordinary
virtue
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
constant
searchings
for
amulets
which
do
no
good
and
cost
much
money
besides
i
could
not
bring
azima
a
gift
she
would
prize
more
highly
better
far
in
her
eyes
than
strings
of
pearls
or
costly
jewels
thus
musing
my
thoughts
wandered
to
my
home
my
treasures
were
before
me
in
imagination
and
i
compared
this
my
wild
and
exciting
life
with
the
peaceful
moments
i
enjoyed
when
i
was
there
with
them
azima
lying
beside
me
and
our
child
amusing
us
with
her
innocent
gambols
the
contrast
was
forcible
and
appealed
to
my
best
feelings
i
fell
asleep
nor
did
i
awake
until
the
bustle
of
preparation
for
the
journey
warned
me
that
it
was
time
to
rise
having
performed
my
ablutions
i
repeated
the
morning
prayer
and
thanksgiving
and
issuing
from
my
little
tent
i
saw
the
band
was
in
readiness
to
move
on
but
my
new
acquaintance
and
his
family
were
as
yet
not
with
us
shall
we
move
on
asked
laloo
who
was
now
my
confidant
being
the
second
of
the
bhuttotes
as
i
stood
near
my
horse
prepared
to
mount
not
yet
said
i
i
expect
some
bunij
from
the
village
they
promised
not
to
be
late
yet
the
day
advances
send
some
one
to
hurry
them
ay
our
friends
of
last
night
i
suppose
meer
sahib
of
course
we
will
wait
for
them
and
i
will
send
a
fellow
to
quicken
them
know
you
how
many
there
will
be
to
deal
with
not
i
i
replied
there
are
a
man
and
his
wife
but
how
many
more
i
know
not
we
shall
soon
see
however
our
messenger
returned
almost
immediately
they
come
said
he
i
had
not
reached
the
village
gate
when
i
saw
them
issue
forth
and
how
many
are
there
i
asked
there
are
two
women
on
ponies
one
old
one
on
foot
and
three
men
armed
with
sword
and
matchlock
six
in
all
said
i
do
you
laloo
tell
off
the
bhuttotes
if
we
find
a
good
place
i
will
give
the
jhirnee
if
not
the
business
can
be
done
true
meer
sahib
he
replied
but
we
had
better
put
it
off
to
tell
you
the
truth
there
was
an
objectionable
omen
this
morning
and
you
know
there
is
no
need
of
risking
anything
certainly
not
we
can
send
on
the
bélhas
and
things
are
best
done
which
are
conducted
regularly
the
village
party
now
approached
us
and
salutations
were
exchanged
we
stayed
not
but
pushed
on
at
as
rapid
a
pace
as
allowed
the
villagers
to
keep
up
with
us
and
we
travelled
thus
to
the
end
of
the
stage
i
saw
no
likely
place
for
the
deed
on
our
way
for
the
country
was
thickly
peopled
and
the
villages
were
close
to
each
other
but
i
heard
with
inward
satisfaction
from
my
acquaintance
that
the
next
march
was
through
a
lonely
tract
and
i
was
urged
by
him
to
be
on
the
alert
and
careful
for
that
robbers
were
plentiful
and
we
might
be
attacked
they
rested
in
our
camp
that
day
and
night
i
watched
eagerly
to
see
if
it
were
possible
the
face
of
the
woman
who
bore
the
prize
i
so
eagerly
coveted
but
i
could
not
discern
it
she
was
strictly
secluded
or
if
she
moved
out
of
the
temporary
screen
her
husband
had
erected
she
was
enveloped
in
a
thick
wrapper
which
defied
my
utmost
attempts
to
discover
her
countenance
but
she
was
and
i
gloried
in
the
thought
that
ere
another
day
should
pass
over
me
she
would
have
fallen
under
my
hand
and
the
charm
would
be
mine
also
you
sahib
will
perhaps
wonder
at
my
eagerness
to
possess
it
but
you
know
us
not
if
you
do
what
mother
is
there
in
hindostan
ay
or
father
who
does
not
covet
a
potent
charm
against
the
evil
eye
for
his
child
or
for
his
wife
far
more
than
riches
nay
the
commonest
necessaries
or
comforts
of
life
a
child
falls
sick
the
glance
of
some
of
one
is
declared
to
have
rested
on
it
ceremonies
are
performed
without
number
pepper
is
burned
placed
in
the
room
and
other
things
done
which
you
would
laugh
at
were
i
to
relate
them
all
and
hence
comes
the
necessity
of
charms
holy
men
are
besought
to
give
them
and
are
paid
for
them
highly
fakeers
are
implored
to
pronounce
mystic
words
over
the
suffering
infant
and
women
will
sell
anything
they
possess
even
their
jewels
to
purchase
an
amulet
which
is
said
to
be
efficacious
sahib
i
had
lost
one
child
another
my
sole
offspring
was
constantly
ailing
and
we
were
tormented
by
a
thousand
miserable
anticipations
regarding
her
within
my
reach
was
a
sovereign
remedy
for
all
so
at
least
i
firmly
believed
can
you
wonder
at
my
eagerness
my
impatience
to
possess
it
laloo
came
to
me
and
with
him
the
chief
of
the
bélhas
we
are
to
go
on
i
suppose
as
soon
as
we
can
said
the
latter
certainly
replied
i
i
hear
the
road
lies
through
a
lonely
tract
which
commences
a
few
coss
from
here
see
that
you
choose
a
good
place
and
that
the
grave
will
hold
six
bodies
jo
hookum
rejoined
the
fellow
but
i
hope
the
information
is
correct
about
the
road
and
that
it
is
not
like
the
last
stage
cultivated
ground
from
first
to
last
i
would
have
defied
the
best
belha
that
ever
drew
breath
to
have
selected
a
spot
free
from
a
chance
of
interruption
rest
content
said
i
the
information
is
good
i
had
it
from
our
who
have
passed
that
way
a
hundred
times
then
i
will
start
by
sunset
continued
he
i
suppose
the
nearer
to
this
the
place
is
selected
consistently
with
security
the
better
certainly
said
i
go
you
have
your
leave
midnight
soon
arrived
we
had
arisen
and
had
proceeded
about
three
coss
on
our
way
we
had
passed
every
village
and
entered
on
the
desolate
tract
i
have
mentioned
the
hot
night
wind
still
sighed
over
the
waste
and
through
the
thorny
bushes
by
which
it
was
thinly
covered
no
sound
broke
the
silence
save
a
shrill
neigh
from
one
of
our
at
intervals
or
the
wild
and
melancholy
note
of
the
plover
as
it
piped
its
song
to
its
mate
and
was
answered
again
from
afar
once
or
twice
the
half
shriek
half
howl
of
a
hyæna
might
be
heard
and
so
like
was
the
cry
to
that
of
a
wretch
under
the
knife
of
an
assassin
that
my
blood
curdled
in
my
veins
as
the
sound
thrilled
through
me
i
rode
on
first
of
the
party
eagerly
looking
for
the
belha
who
should
give
the
welcome
intelligence
that
the
grave
was
ready
and
that
we
were
secure
from
interruption
nor
had
i
long
to
wait
for
this
at
a
turning
in
the
road
i
saw
the
trusty
messenger
seated
and
as
he
espied
me
and
arose
i
hastened
to
meet
him
bhil
manjeh
i
asked
in
our
slang
language
manjeh
was
the
reply
is
ready
meer
sahib
and
how
far
gopal
scarcely
a
from
hence
a
dry
nulla
with
a
sandy
bed
crosses
the
road
and
a
tributary
streamlet
course
between
high
and
narrow
banks
was
the
best
place
we
could
find
good
said
i
you
are
always
careful
now
keep
near
me
and
hold
my
horse
when
i
dismount
i
have
a
share
in
this
affair
which
i
would
not
trust
to
another
i
slackened
my
horse
pace
and
the
party
soon
overtook
me
i
stopped
as
they
came
up
and
dismounted
a
plague
on
these
roads
of
yours
khan
said
i
to
my
acquaintance
my
horse
has
lost
a
shoe
and
his
foot
is
somewhat
tender
so
i
will
walk
a
coss
or
two
to
ease
him
of
my
weight
surely
there
can
not
be
much
more
of
this
stony
track
not
much
a
coss
or
two
perhaps
we
ought
to
be
near
a
dry
nulla
if
i
am
not
mistaken
and
from
thence
the
next
village
is
a
coss
and
a
half
after
that
the
road
is
good
let
the
meer
sahib
ride
on
my
tattoo
said
a
voice
like
music
i
am
cramped
and
stiff
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
walk
awhile
it
was
that
of
my
victim
she
who
was
to
die
under
my
hand
ere
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
she
must
be
beautiful
with
that
voice
thought
i
but
i
shall
see
no
no
khan
said
i
that
must
not
be
i
am
soldier
enough
to
walk
when
i
have
no
horse
mashalla
my
limbs
are
strong
and
supple
and
i
would
not
mind
trying
you
at
a
long
stage
as
you
will
meer
sahib
but
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
and
she
dismounts
alla
knows
is
a
small
recompense
for
your
safe
protection
over
this
dreary
tract
which
never
man
yet
passed
but
with
fear
and
apprehension
the
nulla
too
we
shall
reach
it
soon
they
say
many
a
brave
fellow
blood
has
moistened
its
sand
i
saw
the
woman
shudder
at
her
husband
speech
and
i
checked
him
shame
on
you
khan
said
i
think
who
hears
you
women
ears
are
not
fitted
to
listen
to
tales
of
blood
save
when
they
are
of
a
and
of
scenes
in
which
honour
is
gained
and
fame
won
at
the
sword
point
here
you
are
safe
no
rascally
dacoo
would
dare
to
meddle
with
a
kafila
like
ours
and
we
shall
pass
the
nulla
as
we
have
those
behind
us
without
a
thought
of
its
dangers
or
what
has
ever
happened
in
it
but
what
was
that
i
eagerly
asked
as
something
crossed
our
path
close
to
my
feet
nothing
but
a
hare
said
the
khan
some
prowling
jackal
has
scared
her
from
her
form
and
she
seeks
another
a
hare
i
repeated
the
current
of
my
blood
seeming
to
be
suddenly
arrested
as
i
thought
on
the
fearful
omen
to
a
thug
one
that
could
not
be
disregarded
or
if
disregarded
was
certain
to
be
followed
by
the
most
dire
calamities
nothing
less
than
death
or
long
imprisonment
yes
meer
sahib
a
hare
why
should
it
astonish
you
but
across
my
very
path
i
muttered
involuntarily
was
chance
said
the
man
what
of
it
nothing
replied
i
nothing
we
have
an
old
superstition
about
it
in
my
country
but
is
an
old
woman
tale
i
dare
say
i
paced
on
in
silence
ya
alla
what
a
conflict
was
raging
in
my
heart
i
have
told
you
i
disregarded
omens
i
cared
not
for
them
only
as
they
were
the
soul
of
thuggee
as
far
as
my
men
were
concerned
and
to
humour
them
i
feigned
to
be
particular
in
their
observance
but
my
soul
quailed
when
i
was
put
to
the
proof
every
tale
i
had
heard
of
the
vengeance
of
bhowanee
at
a
conscious
neglect
of
her
commands
and
omens
flashed
in
rapid
succession
across
my
mind
how
one
had
died
eaten
by
worms
another
been
overtaken
by
what
the
world
called
justice
how
another
had
lost
his
wife
or
children
and
i
too
had
yet
a
child
i
say
i
quailed
in
mental
terror
for
awhile
but
mine
was
a
stout
heart
a
noble
spirit
and
it
roused
at
my
call
like
that
of
a
good
steed
which
worn
and
weary
with
travel
yet
at
the
approach
of
strife
or
danger
bears
his
master
as
gallantly
as
though
he
were
fresh
from
his
stall
yes
my
soul
rallied
away
with
such
idle
tales
fit
only
to
be
bugbears
to
children
said
i
mentally
ameer
ali
is
not
to
be
frightened
by
them
and
to
lose
the
charm
the
object
of
my
anxiety
when
almost
within
my
grasp
i
laughed
aloud
you
are
merry
meer
sahib
cried
laloo
who
i
saw
was
at
his
place
tell
us
your
thoughts
that
we
may
laugh
too
and
by
alla
we
need
it
for
a
more
unsainted
country
i
never
saw
was
but
a
thought
said
i
know
you
where
my
hookah
is
i
do
not
he
replied
but
i
will
call
for
it
and
the
word
was
passed
by
those
who
followed
us
for
it
to
be
brought
this
was
the
preparatory
signal
every
one
heard
it
and
took
his
post
the
place
could
not
be
far
and
with
my
last
words
had
passed
away
every
chance
of
life
to
our
companions
nor
was
it
far
off
a
few
moments
walking
brought
us
to
the
brink
of
the
nulla
i
first
descended
into
it
and
disengaged
my
roomal
i
was
ready
one
by
one
the
others
followed
me
and
we
were
now
in
the
middle
of
the
dry
and
sandy
bed
mingled
together
the
victims
and
their
destroyers
i
saw
the
time
was
come
and
i
gave
the
jhirnee
they
fell
ay
all
and
almost
at
the
same
time
there
was
no
sound
no
cry
all
that
i
heard
was
a
faint
gurgling
noise
from
the
husband
of
the
woman
who
had
writhed
in
her
under
my
fatal
grip
a
few
convulsive
throes
and
she
was
dead
i
tore
away
the
bodice
which
covered
her
bosom
i
thrust
my
hands
into
it
and
groped
upon
the
still
warm
breast
for
the
prize
i
had
so
earnestly
longed
for
i
found
it
tied
to
a
silk
cord
which
defied
my
utmost
efforts
to
break
but
i
unsheathed
my
dagger
and
cut
it
and
i
hugged
the
treasure
to
my
heart
in
a
frenzy
of
exultation
one
look
at
the
face
thought
i
and
the
lughaees
may
do
their
work
and
i
gazed
on
it
it
was
beautiful
very
beautiful
but
the
expression
and
the
eyes
sahib
why
did
i
look
at
it
i
might
have
spared
myself
years
of
torment
had
i
not
done
so
that
face
of
all
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
death
haunts
me
still
and
will
ever
haunt
me
sleeping
or
waking
not
that
it
had
any
particular
effect
on
me
then
no
it
was
afterwards
as
you
shall
hear
and
when
i
had
discovered
what
i
had
done
yes
she
was
beautiful
fair
as
my
own
azima
as
delicate
and
faultless
in
form
the
lughaees
shall
not
behold
these
beauties
thought
i
nor
could
i
listen
to
their
coarse
remarks
so
i
covered
up
the
bosom
folded
the
body
decently
in
the
sheet
which
had
been
around
her
and
sat
down
by
it
to
await
their
coming
how
jemadar
sahib
said
gopal
as
he
came
up
to
me
have
you
not
stripped
the
body
but
let
me
do
so
yonder
sheet
is
worth
two
rupees
let
it
alone
cried
i
touch
her
not
she
is
too
fair
for
the
like
of
you
to
look
on
and
hark
ye
my
friend
let
her
be
buried
as
you
see
her
now
whatever
the
others
may
say
tell
them
that
it
is
my
order
and
for
your
own
share
you
shall
have
a
new
sheet
when
we
reach
jhalone
jo
hookum
said
the
man
you
shall
be
obeyed
but
have
you
searched
for
jewels
i
have
she
had
none
away
with
her
and
see
that
i
am
obeyed
yet
stay
i
will
accompany
you
i
went
with
him
the
grave
was
where
they
had
described
it
between
the
high
and
narrow
banks
of
a
small
watercourse
it
was
deep
and
already
contained
some
bodies
i
saw
that
of
the
fair
girl
laid
carefully
down
over
them
and
i
prevented
their
mutilating
it
with
their
knives
as
they
had
done
the
others
i
waited
till
all
had
been
finished
and
the
grave
covered
in
and
collecting
my
scattered
party
we
pursued
our
journey
it
was
well
we
had
been
so
expeditious
for
scarcely
half
a
coss
from
the
spot
we
met
a
large
party
of
travellers
who
confident
in
their
numbers
had
pushed
on
by
night
as
we
had
done
short
greetings
were
exchanged
between
us
a
few
inquiries
as
to
the
road
whether
water
was
to
be
had
and
where
and
we
passed
on
our
booty
was
small
enough
as
you
may
conceive
about
forty
rupees
a
few
changes
of
raiment
the
tattoo
of
the
deceased
and
the
few
and
simple
ornaments
of
the
women
worth
perhaps
a
hundred
rupees
were
all
we
got
but
i
had
the
real
prize
worth
in
my
eyes
thousands
of
rupees
no
one
knew
i
had
it
and
i
kept
it
hung
round
my
own
neck
and
close
to
my
heart
a
thousand
times
i
took
it
out
and
gazed
at
it
there
was
something
about
it
which
had
a
mysterious
effect
on
me
many
times
i
thought
i
had
seen
it
before
and
i
fancied
its
old
and
battered
surface
was
familiar
to
me
but
my
mind
gave
me
no
clue
to
the
idea
and
i
attributed
the
effect
i
have
described
to
the
influence
of
the
charm
itself
and
i
was
assured
of
its
potency
how
azima
will
prize
it
thought
i
in
itself
valueless
yet
a
treasure
in
her
eyes
and
mine
for
it
will
protect
our
child
and
many
an
envious
eye
is
upon
her
we
were
still
far
from
jhalone
and
the
season
admitted
of
farther
wanderings
but
i
was
sated
strange
to
say
i
no
longer
thirsted
for
adventure
and
though
it
came
and
men
were
delivered
into
our
hands
yet
i
sought
not
for
them
those
we
destroyed
were
casual
travellers
who
joined
our
party
and
whose
destruction
was
unavoidable
we
held
a
general
deliberation
at
a
village
on
the
confines
of
malwa
and
though
some
were
for
travelling
northward
as
far
as
agra
and
thence
to
jhalone
i
overruled
this
and
indeed
had
the
majority
on
my
side
who
were
satisfied
with
what
we
had
got
and
longed
for
their
homes
as
i
did
however
my
friends
said
i
our
proceeding
homewards
need
not
bring
us
worse
booty
than
we
should
get
by
going
north
roads
are
roads
and
travellers
will
surely
be
on
them
wherever
we
go
let
us
not
relax
in
our
vigilance
and
do
you
trust
in
the
lucky
fortune
of
ameer
ali
victory
has
always
followed
him
and
his
star
is
still
high
in
the
ascendant
above
all
let
us
consult
the
omens
and
by
them
be
guided
if
it
is
our
fate
soon
to
see
our
homes
they
will
determine
our
actions
and
proceedings
my
speech
was
received
with
plaudits
the
omens
were
consulted
and
though
none
remarkable
were
observed
yet
in
the
opinion
of
the
thugs
we
were
justified
in
holding
our
present
direction
till
it
should
be
changed
either
by
meeting
with
new
adventures
or
adverse
omens
accordingly
we
pursued
our
route
i
forget
how
many
days
it
was
afterwards
but
we
were
encamped
at
tearee
a
large
town
in
bundelkhund
and
had
been
there
two
days
in
the
hope
of
bunij
we
had
been
unlucky
in
not
meeting
with
any
till
then
but
our
tilhaees
were
actively
employed
and
i
was
determined
not
to
quit
the
town
without
an
adventure
as
it
was
the
last
place
on
the
road
to
jhalone
where
we
could
hope
to
meet
with
any
of
consequence
the
sothas
and
tilhaees
however
returned
in
the
afternoon
with
downcast
faces
declaring
they
could
meet
with
no
one
except
miserable
creatures
hardly
worth
the
trouble
of
destroying
and
all
were
for
moving
off
the
next
morning
i
was
piqued
at
our
ill
luck
i
know
not
why
stay
however
said
i
to
them
all
for
the
morrow
something
tells
me
it
will
be
a
lucky
day
and
one
is
not
of
much
consequence
my
will
was
of
course
law
to
them
and
early
the
next
day
i
dressed
myself
in
my
best
clothes
armed
myself
with
my
most
showy
weapons
and
taking
some
of
the
thugs
with
me
as
it
were
a
personal
escort
i
rode
into
the
town
causing
my
horse
to
caracole
as
i
went
in
order
to
show
off
my
admirable
horsemanship
twice
did
i
ride
up
and
down
the
bazar
and
the
principal
streets
but
without
meeting
with
any
hope
of
adventure
or
bunij
at
last
observing
three
mahomedans
seated
on
a
chubootra
or
terrace
under
the
shade
of
a
large
i
rode
up
to
them
and
inquired
whether
they
could
direct
me
to
the
abode
of
any
dealer
in
pearls
or
precious
stones
as
i
wished
to
purchase
some
are
you
in
earnest
said
the
oldest
of
the
three
or
do
you
merely
ask
to
find
out
whether
our
poor
town
would
afford
you
such
precious
commodities
god
forbid
sirs
said
i
that
one
so
young
as
i
am
should
dare
to
endeavour
to
jest
with
men
of
your
age
and
respectable
appearance
i
do
indeed
seek
what
i
have
said
and
shall
rejoice
if
any
of
you
can
direct
my
steps
for
here
i
am
a
stranger
since
such
is
the
case
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
am
happy
in
being
able
even
at
this
moment
to
present
you
to
shekh
who
sits
here
beside
me
and
who
follows
the
respectable
calling
you
are
in
search
of
but
you
had
better
dismount
and
if
such
is
your
pleasure
join
our
mujlis
for
as
long
as
you
feel
inclined
my
worthy
friend
will
then
i
doubt
not
be
happy
to
accompany
you
to
his
abode
and
show
you
the
articles
you
require
you
are
kind
said
i
and
i
accept
of
your
civil
invitation
so
saying
i
dismounted
and
ascended
by
a
few
steps
to
where
they
were
sitting
a
few
moments
were
occupied
in
the
ceremonies
of
being
seated
my
new
acquaintance
called
for
a
hookah
and
sherbet
and
in
a
few
moments
we
were
on
excellent
terms
and
what
may
be
your
distinguished
name
said
the
elder
of
the
three
who
had
first
accosted
me
i
named
myself
a
poor
syud
said
i
an
unworthy
descendant
of
our
prophet
on
whose
name
be
peace
mashalla
i
told
you
so
cried
the
old
man
mashalla
there
is
no
mistaking
the
noble
race
and
his
speech
too
how
say
ye
my
friends
is
it
not
sweet
and
mellifluous
like
a
verse
of
hafiz
ameen
ameen
cried
both
is
even
so
the
young
syud
is
a
worthy
representative
of
his
tribe
and
we
are
fortunate
in
having
made
his
acquaintance
you
overpower
me
worthy
sirs
said
i
i
little
merit
these
encomiums
for
having
spent
all
my
days
in
camps
and
in
strife
i
have
learned
few
of
those
courtesies
which
ought
to
adorn
the
manners
of
every
true
believer
you
have
served
then
with
sindia
asked
the
no
said
i
not
in
his
armies
though
there
has
been
tough
fighting
enough
to
be
seen
with
them
i
have
served
in
the
dukhun
and
i
am
proud
to
say
under
the
banners
of
salabut
khan
of
ellichpoor
a
good
name
cried
all
the
noble
khan
too
has
won
it
bravely
though
not
on
our
side
in
the
late
contests
it
matters
not
said
i
wherever
a
blow
was
to
be
struck
or
there
was
hope
of
a
fight
or
a
foray
salabut
khan
was
ever
first
in
the
fray
and
the
last
to
leave
it
and
your
destination
syud
asked
the
jhalone
i
replied
salabut
khan
has
reduced
his
force
and
there
being
no
longer
hope
of
employment
for
a
cavalier
like
myself
i
returned
home
to
my
father
and
have
taken
quiet
service
with
the
rajah
whom
alla
preserve
for
he
is
as
generous
a
prince
as
any
of
hindostan
and
on
his
behalf
i
have
recently
been
on
a
mission
to
the
durbar
of
doulut
rao
on
some
matters
which
have
been
in
dispute
between
them
i
am
proud
too
to
say
that
all
has
been
quietly
settled
soobhan
alla
cried
the
third
worthy
how
could
it
be
otherwise
since
our
honoured
guest
has
managed
the
negotiation
again
i
bowed
my
head
to
the
earth
and
acknowledged
the
compliment
some
desultory
conversation
followed
and
i
rose
to
depart
my
time
is
precious
said
i
and
i
implore
you
to
excuse
me
i
have
much
to
arrange
about
the
men
who
accompany
me
and
i
go
on
to
the
chowree
to
settle
their
accounts
with
the
kotwal
if
the
worthy
shekh
will
allow
one
of
his
attendants
to
point
out
his
abode
i
will
notice
it
and
visit
him
ere
sunset
nay
meer
sahib
this
can
not
be
replied
the
shekh
behold
i
am
ready
i
will
accompany
you
my
poor
house
is
not
far
off
and
alla
forbid
i
should
be
the
means
of
trespassing
upon
your
time
he
arose
girded
up
his
loins
threw
his
shawl
over
his
shoulders
and
thrusting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
prepared
to
accompany
me
i
take
my
leave
then
worthy
sirs
said
i
to
the
others
may
health
be
with
you
not
without
the
pan
and
utr
meer
sahib
said
the
elder
it
can
not
be
that
we
should
let
you
go
like
a
dog
and
calling
to
an
attendant
the
articles
were
brought
the
pan
was
presented
to
me
i
was
duly
anointed
on
my
beard
and
under
my
arms
and
after
a
few
more
salams
and
compliments
i
was
following
my
new
acquaintance
the
pearl
merchant
is
he
to
be
bunij
whispered
one
of
my
attendant
thugs
to
me
in
ramasee
as
i
passed
him
hush
said
i
speak
not
a
word
but
run
all
of
ye
before
us
and
clear
the
way
as
if
i
were
a
great
man
they
obeyed
me
and
ran
forward
shouting
and
pushing
the
crowd
to
and
fro
as
though
i
had
been
a
nobleman
of
fifty
descents
and
a
hundred
titles
we
soon
reached
the
house
of
the
merchant
and
leaving
our
slippers
at
the
door
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
at
once
into
the
private
apartment
where
i
suppose
he
transacted
his
business
or
received
his
best
customers
it
was
a
dahlan
or
verandah
opening
into
a
court
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
small
fountain
its
edges
were
planted
with
red
poppies
and
larkspur
in
various
figures
and
a
plantain
tree
or
two
flung
their
broad
green
leaves
over
all
the
place
looked
cool
and
was
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
the
room
where
we
sat
had
been
newly
whitewashed
and
its
floor
covered
with
a
white
cloth
except
the
musnud
itself
which
was
of
yellow
cloth
bordered
with
blue
velvet
a
few
large
pillows
invited
me
to
recline
and
forget
the
world
and
its
cares
such
shall
be
my
own
home
thought
i
after
awhile
a
fountain
is
easily
made
and
i
will
enjoy
my
peace
and
quiet
even
as
this
worthy
does
i
had
seen
a
hundred
such
but
the
unobtrusive
neatness
and
comfort
of
the
spot
struck
me
forcibly
and
whilst
envying
the
possessor
his
peaceful
lot
i
was
inwardly
forming
a
plan
to
decoy
him
with
me
which
i
had
leisure
to
mature
for
he
had
left
me
seated
and
was
for
some
time
absent
chapter
xliv
he
returned
after
some
time
bringing
with
him
a
small
casket
and
leading
by
the
hand
a
boy
whom
he
presented
to
me
as
his
son
his
firstborn
he
was
about
twelve
years
of
age
intelligent
in
feature
and
withal
handsome
and
possessing
a
confidence
of
manner
i
had
never
seen
surpassed
alla
has
been
merciful
to
you
my
friend
said
i
and
the
sahib
zadah
is
worthy
of
his
sire
i
had
a
son
too
once
who
promised
to
be
such
a
one
as
the
boy
before
me
but
it
was
his
will
and
i
have
now
a
lonely
house
yet
why
obtrude
my
griefs
upon
a
stranger
you
have
doubtless
other
flowers
of
the
same
tree
there
are
three
of
them
said
the
merchant
and
they
are
the
pride
of
my
existence
for
after
all
what
is
wealth
what
is
honour
what
is
or
respect
in
the
world
without
some
one
to
inherit
it
and
to
tell
of
his
father
to
yet
unborn
generations
and
you
are
yet
young
why
be
without
hope
alla
will
not
fail
to
listen
to
the
prayers
of
a
devout
syud
alas
said
i
i
think
not
of
it
a
girl
remains
to
me
who
is
contracted
in
marriage
to
the
son
of
a
worthy
neighbour
and
upon
her
rest
my
hopes
at
present
it
is
on
her
account
that
i
seek
a
few
pearls
for
the
marriage
ceremonies
and
they
are
here
meer
sahib
pearls
from
surat
and
from
serendeeb
jewels
that
a
monarch
might
be
proud
to
wear
and
he
opened
the
casket
and
displayed
its
beautiful
contents
to
my
admiring
eyes
they
are
indeed
beautiful
said
i
but
a
poor
soldier
like
myself
has
little
to
do
with
such
costly
ornaments
show
me
i
pray
you
a
few
of
a
lower
price
such
as
will
suit
my
present
wants
which
do
not
reach
further
than
three
hundred
rupees
worth
he
selected
a
string
and
held
them
out
to
me
they
were
what
i
really
required
and
the
purchase
was
quickly
concluded
still
however
the
glittering
strings
lay
before
me
and
as
i
took
up
one
in
particular
of
great
beauty
from
the
evenness
of
the
pearls
and
their
bright
water
i
said
as
if
involuntarily
would
that
my
patron
could
see
these
eh
what
cried
the
merchant
do
you
think
he
would
purchase
them
assuredly
said
i
for
shortly
before
i
left
jhalone
the
rajah
was
in
the
greatest
need
of
pearls
and
sent
hither
and
thither
for
them
but
without
success
none
were
to
be
procured
and
he
was
even
talking
of
sending
to
surat
for
some
but
the
length
of
the
journey
and
the
risk
put
the
matter
out
of
his
head
the
merchant
mused
for
awhile
at
last
he
said
and
you
really
think
he
would
purchase
them
i
do
his
daughter
will
be
married
next
year
and
he
is
collecting
jewels
for
the
ceremony
they
are
very
beautiful
said
the
merchant
taking
up
the
string
are
they
not
i
have
had
them
now
for
two
years
and
no
one
here
is
rich
enough
to
purchase
them
yet
they
are
cheap
i
swear
by
your
beard
they
are
and
i
look
for
but
little
profit
upon
them
the
price
i
asked
from
a
poor
man
like
you
meer
sahib
a
syud
and
a
soldier
i
would
take
six
thousand
rupees
but
from
a
rajah
and
an
infidel
i
would
ask
eight
good
said
i
now
listen
to
me
i
am
as
you
say
poor
and
i
have
the
heavy
expense
of
this
marriage
coming
upon
me
what
say
you
to
accepting
my
aid
and
taking
the
pearls
to
jhalone
and
selling
them
there
the
rajah
is
much
guided
by
me
and
if
i
get
him
to
pay
eight
thousand
rupees
you
will
pay
me
back
the
three
hundred
i
now
owe
you
for
those
i
have
purchased
turn
it
over
in
your
mind
and
tell
me
your
determination
jhalone
is
a
long
way
said
the
merchant
and
if
i
sell
my
pearls
how
am
i
to
get
back
with
the
money
thieves
will
hear
of
the
transaction
and
i
may
be
waylaid
and
murdered
fear
not
replied
i
be
at
rest
on
that
score
to
one
who
has
come
so
far
from
his
home
to
oblige
him
the
rajah
will
give
an
escort
to
return
of
this
i
am
confident
and
if
this
is
all
that
prevents
your
making
the
determination
to
accompany
me
you
had
better
dismiss
it
from
your
mind
at
once
i
will
consult
the
astrologer
said
he
nay
shekhjee
i
replied
this
is
too
ridiculous
what
have
we
true
believers
to
do
with
astrologers
the
man
you
would
consult
is
a
hindoo
and
there
is
abomination
in
the
very
word
besides
what
danger
is
there
i
have
some
fifty
men
with
me
my
own
attendants
and
the
rajah
sepoys
therefore
no
harm
can
come
to
you
as
for
your
return
you
will
have
a
few
horsemen
who
will
afford
you
ample
protection
again
you
said
you
have
had
the
necklace
for
two
years
and
never
had
an
offer
for
it
why
therefore
keep
your
money
unemployed
be
wise
man
and
come
with
me
yes
father
said
the
lad
listen
to
what
the
brave
meer
sahib
says
and
i
will
accompany
you
and
see
the
world
beyond
our
town
you
know
you
have
promised
to
take
me
with
you
the
first
journey
you
make
well
it
is
very
tempting
certainly
said
the
merchant
eight
thousand
rupees
you
said
meer
sahib
that
is
worth
going
for
and
these
baubles
are
useless
to
me
here
to
tell
you
the
truth
continued
he
i
got
them
from
a
pindharee
who
served
with
cheetoo
or
dost
mahomed
i
know
not
which
he
kept
them
as
long
as
he
could
but
the
lubhurs
were
broken
up
by
the
feringhees
a
sad
blow
to
our
free
trade
and
though
a
few
horsemen
his
own
followers
stuck
to
him
yet
he
had
nothing
to
give
them
at
last
when
they
became
mutinous
and
threatened
his
life
for
their
pay
he
was
obliged
to
sell
these
and
i
was
the
purchaser
and
you
got
them
cheap
said
i
yes
they
were
not
dear
meer
sahib
a
man
in
necessity
rarely
drives
a
hard
bargain
i
got
them
cheap
and
yet
i
swear
to
you
that
they
are
cheap
at
eight
thousand
rupees
i
say
this
from
experience
for
i
have
sold
worse
to
mahdajee
sindia
himself
for
ten
thousand
but
he
will
not
purchase
now
and
they
lie
heavy
on
my
hands
all
therefore
considered
shekhjee
said
i
you
had
by
far
better
accompany
me
to
jhalone
as
to
the
journey
a
month
will
see
you
back
again
the
season
is
favourable
for
travel
and
as
we
are
a
strong
party
and
march
by
night
you
will
never
be
incommoded
by
the
sun
well
meer
sahib
i
have
almost
determined
but
it
will
be
necessary
to
tell
those
inside
and
he
pointed
with
his
thumb
to
the
zenana
and
as
you
said
you
had
to
go
to
the
kotwal
on
some
business
if
you
could
look
in
here
after
it
is
all
over
about
the
time
of
evening
prayer
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
a
decisive
answer
much
as
we
affect
to
despise
women
you
know
i
dare
say
meer
sahib
that
it
makes
one
uncomfortable
to
undertake
anything
more
especially
a
journey
without
consulting
them
as
you
will
said
i
i
am
indifferent
about
the
matter
it
is
for
your
good
alone
that
i
have
offered
this
counsel
and
in
this
world
of
infidelity
and
selfishness
it
is
refreshing
to
the
heart
either
to
assist
a
brother
moslem
or
to
be
assisted
by
one
without
selfish
motives
alla
hafiz
i
take
my
leave
and
i
will
return
by
the
moghreb
and
bring
the
money
for
my
pearls
i
left
him
is
he
to
be
bunij
again
asked
the
thug
peace
fool
said
i
laughing
he
has
gorged
the
bait
but
the
hook
is
not
yet
struck
wait
inshalla
ameer
ali
is
not
the
son
of
an
owl
or
a
jackass
and
inshalla
we
will
yet
throw
dirt
on
his
beard
for
all
he
is
so
cautious
i
had
no
business
with
the
kotwal
as
you
may
have
imagined
i
rode
to
my
tent
and
assembling
the
leaders
of
the
band
developed
to
them
my
plans
and
gave
them
instructions
as
to
their
demeanour
and
conduct
before
our
new
guest
in
prospect
this
done
i
was
easy
about
the
rest
if
he
came
it
was
almost
too
much
to
hope
for
yet
i
had
confidence
in
myself
and
in
my
fate
and
the
boy
that
beautiful
boy
i
had
for
once
no
heart
to
be
a
participator
in
his
death
i
must
not
allow
him
to
accompany
us
i
said
to
myself
enough
that
the
house
is
made
desolate
by
the
death
of
the
father
i
was
thus
musing
when
laloo
came
to
me
you
are
mad
meer
sahib
said
he
this
plan
is
not
feasible
bunij
met
with
on
the
road
is
well
enough
but
to
drag
a
man
out
of
his
house
as
i
may
say
to
destroy
him
is
too
bad
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
justifiable
ha
cried
i
so
you
are
turned
against
me
how
is
this
god
forbid
that
you
should
say
so
meer
sahib
but
look
at
the
matter
you
are
known
in
the
town
people
have
seen
you
enter
the
house
of
the
merchant
and
they
will
know
that
he
accompanies
you
will
they
not
hunt
us
out
you
are
an
owl
said
i
laughing
trust
me
there
is
no
fear
and
as
for
taking
the
man
out
of
his
house
i
tell
thee
i
see
no
more
difference
in
it
than
in
having
met
him
on
the
road
in
a
regular
way
let
me
alone
i
know
my
work
and
when
we
have
got
him
you
shall
yourself
applaud
what
i
have
done
nay
it
was
but
a
friendly
remonstrance
said
he
and
as
you
feel
confident
go
on
with
the
matter
he
will
be
good
bunij
assuredly
to
the
tune
of
some
thousand
rupees
by
alla
i
was
tired
of
the
humdrum
work
we
have
been
at
lately
and
my
blood
stagnated
in
my
veins
this
has
stirred
it
and
i
have
set
myself
to
the
work
you
know
i
seldom
fail
seldom
indeed
meer
sahib
but
can
i
do
aught
yes
you
can
said
i
follow
me
at
a
little
distance
and
note
the
house
the
fool
i
am
after
will
depend
on
his
astrologer
for
a
good
day
to
quit
his
home
i
am
sure
of
this
for
he
said
he
would
and
he
took
my
bantering
against
it
with
an
ill
grace
find
out
his
servants
and
from
them
the
brahmin
take
money
with
you
and
pay
him
there
is
enough
of
daylight
yet
and
remember
morning
is
to
be
a
lucky
one
and
the
next
a
bad
one
mind
this
and
do
your
best
for
much
depends
upon
it
nay
everything
on
my
head
and
eyes
be
it
said
he
and
therefore
meer
sahib
i
pray
you
accompany
me
even
now
better
in
disguise
perhaps
and
show
me
the
house
leave
the
rest
to
me
and
i
will
not
fail
a
good
thought
said
i
the
sun
will
not
set
for
the
next
four
hours
i
can
easily
return
and
equip
myself
afresh
so
saying
i
stripped
myself
of
my
fine
clothes
put
on
others
which
were
soiled
and
dirty
tied
up
my
face
except
my
eyes
and
tucking
my
sword
under
my
arm
looked
as
disreputable
a
brawler
or
smoker
of
ganja
as
any
in
the
good
town
of
tearee
come
said
i
our
errand
is
soon
done
and
so
it
was
we
walked
past
the
house
and
i
left
my
ally
at
the
corner
of
the
street
with
a
hundred
rupees
in
his
waistband
and
a
cunning
heart
in
his
breast
i
returned
and
myself
i
mounted
my
horse
and
took
my
way
to
the
merchant
with
the
money
i
owed
him
i
found
him
in
the
same
spot
but
as
the
evening
was
sultry
he
led
me
to
the
terrace
of
his
house
where
carpets
had
been
spread
for
our
convenience
i
paid
my
money
and
received
the
pearls
and
then
entered
upon
the
main
object
of
my
visit
you
will
go
then
shekhjee
said
i
or
is
your
mind
against
it
not
at
all
not
at
all
replied
he
it
is
my
wish
to
go
my
great
wish
meer
sahib
but
when
i
mentioned
it
in
my
zenana
though
the
proposition
met
with
no
opposing
words
or
tears
they
one
and
all
declared
that
a
lucky
day
must
be
fixed
without
which
it
would
be
clearly
of
no
use
my
going
at
all
you
know
what
women
are
meer
sahib
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
could
not
overcome
their
scruples
for
the
more
i
argued
and
persuaded
the
more
strongly
they
opposed
and
in
fact
the
matter
became
so
serious
that
to
pacify
them
mind
you
to
pacify
them
i
sent
ten
rupees
to
a
brahmin
who
lives
hard
by
who
is
a
noted
astrologer
and
the
only
one
here
in
whom
any
confidence
is
placed
alla
is
my
witness
i
cared
not
what
he
said
but
when
a
message
came
back
to
say
that
was
an
unlucky
day
the
whole
wives
slaves
and
asseels
set
up
such
a
howl
of
lamentation
at
what
might
have
happened
and
afterwards
of
congratulation
at
my
having
escaped
the
threatened
evil
that
i
was
fairly
stunned
and
have
given
up
the
idea
of
the
journey
for
at
any
rate
but
you
know
meer
sahib
conjunction
of
planets
may
have
a
different
effect
and
as
you
will
stay
indeed
shekhjee
said
i
i
can
not
stay
here
have
i
idled
away
three
whole
days
and
i
can
remain
no
longer
for
time
is
precious
to
me
my
patron
will
even
now
wonder
what
has
delayed
me
and
to
lose
his
favour
will
be
the
loss
of
my
means
of
maintenance
so
i
start
most
assuredly
whether
you
come
or
not
and
as
to
your
accompanying
me
that
is
your
matter
i
am
perfectly
indifferent
to
it
except
that
i
shall
lose
your
pleasant
society
on
the
road
he
was
fairly
perplexed
he
had
evidently
reckoned
on
my
stay
but
my
careless
yet
determined
manner
of
speaking
left
him
no
hope
of
a
change
in
my
opinions
and
as
a
persian
would
have
said
he
held
the
finger
of
deliberation
between
the
teeth
of
impatient
desire
there
he
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
on
the
ground
in
silence
it
was
a
struggle
between
the
love
of
gain
and
superstition
for
though
he
had
wished
me
to
believe
the
contrary
he
was
as
fully
imbued
with
the
belief
of
lucky
and
unlucky
days
as
any
of
his
wives
slaves
or
asseels
at
length
he
said
meer
sahib
you
remember
our
agreement
the
two
hundred
rupees
i
will
make
it
another
hundred
if
you
stay
one
more
day
you
are
a
poor
man
and
a
hundred
rupees
will
buy
many
clothes
for
your
marriage
here
was
a
direct
attempt
to
cheat
me
out
of
a
hundred
rupees
and
for
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
i
could
have
strangled
him
on
the
spot
yet
i
kept
my
temper
i
was
playing
too
deep
a
game
to
lose
it
and
for
a
trifle
too
no
shekh
said
i
it
can
not
be
i
would
not
for
a
thousand
rupees
stay
an
hour
after
daylight
you
can
not
tempt
me
but
have
you
ever
thought
that
your
nujoomee
may
have
played
you
false
and
that
it
requires
a
few
more
rupees
than
ten
to
make
the
heavens
propitious
i
have
heard
of
such
things
ay
and
proved
them
too
or
perhaps
i
might
believe
in
the
aspect
of
the
stars
as
you
do
ay
say
you
so
my
friend
cried
he
by
alla
i
would
beat
the
rogue
with
a
shoe
in
his
own
temple
with
a
shoe
of
cow
leather
too
if
i
could
think
he
was
trying
to
cheat
me
but
that
is
impossible
how
can
he
help
the
position
of
the
stars
and
yet
say
shall
i
send
more
money
no
said
i
surely
not
if
he
is
honest
he
will
fling
it
in
your
servant
face
if
he
is
a
rogue
he
will
keep
it
and
send
word
that
the
stars
have
changed
in
the
first
case
you
will
eat
dirt
in
the
second
you
will
be
cheated
and
he
will
laugh
at
your
beard
no
i
see
no
help
for
you
but
to
go
in
defiance
of
him
the
zenana
and
the
stars
and
this
will
prove
you
to
be
a
man
impossible
meer
sahib
said
he
despondingly
putting
the
nujoomee
out
of
the
question
i
have
four
wives
alla
help
me
the
lawful
number
you
know
but
oh
my
friend
their
wrath
is
dreadful
and
i
dare
not
provoke
it
it
is
enough
said
i
you
will
not
go
because
you
dare
not
not
because
you
do
not
wish
it
exactly
meer
sahib
you
have
hit
upon
the
very
cause
my
own
heart
is
willing
and
the
prospect
of
gain
leads
me
but
those
women
it
was
prayer
time
and
the
muezzin
sonorous
voice
proclaimed
the
hour
from
the
roof
of
a
neighbouring
mosque
we
performed
our
ablutions
and
as
good
mussulmans
we
spread
our
carpets
and
turning
to
the
still
glowing
west
poured
forth
our
evening
praise
and
thanksgiving
i
was
determined
to
stay
till
the
last
moment
i
could
to
give
my
emissary
time
for
his
proceedings
and
if
no
message
came
from
the
astrologer
to
try
some
other
plan
or
even
to
agree
to
stay
another
day
ah
gold
thought
i
if
thou
desertest
me
now
at
my
best
need
i
will
forswear
thy
worship
our
prayers
were
ended
and
still
we
sat
and
conversed
but
no
message
came
to
suit
my
purpose
i
had
gradually
led
the
merchant
back
to
the
subject
of
the
journey
and
was
picturing
to
him
in
terms
suited
to
his
avaricious
soul
the
reception
he
would
assuredly
meet
with
at
jhalone
and
i
was
preparing
my
words
to
introduce
a
change
in
my
opinions
as
to
staying
another
day
when
a
servant
came
up
the
steps
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
at
which
he
started
yet
at
the
same
time
his
face
put
on
a
joyous
appearance
excuse
me
for
an
instant
my
friend
said
he
i
am
wanted
below
some
one
awaits
me
in
the
dewan
khana
wait
here
and
i
will
rejoin
you
instantly
my
heart
beat
loud
and
quick
in
my
bosom
as
i
watched
him
down
the
steps
could
it
be
that
i
had
succeeded
or
was
there
any
fear
of
danger
to
my
own
person
i
looked
over
the
terrace
it
was
far
too
high
to
leap
from
escape
if
there
was
danger
was
impracticable
but
a
moment
thought
rallied
me
and
as
i
disengaged
my
trusty
sword
and
held
it
ready
for
action
i
laughed
at
my
own
fears
for
i
knew
that
i
could
defend
that
narrow
stair
against
a
host
i
looked
over
into
the
of
the
dewan
khana
but
saw
no
one
i
could
hear
two
loud
voices
in
low
and
earnest
conversation
and
as
i
stretched
forth
my
neck
and
bent
over
the
parapet
of
the
terrace
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
catch
a
syllable
i
was
suddenly
gratified
by
seeing
the
merchant
and
a
figure
robed
in
white
which
i
knew
at
once
to
be
that
of
a
hindoo
while
his
bare
and
shaven
head
proved
him
to
be
a
priest
emerge
from
the
dewan
khana
and
now
their
words
came
clearly
to
me
then
there
is
no
obstacle
said
the
merchant
none
said
the
brahmin
for
so
he
was
as
i
have
said
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
tables
and
calculations
which
i
have
just
discovered
my
art
also
told
me
that
thou
wert
anxious
to
go
am
i
right
right
ah
virtuous
brahmin
assuredly
thou
art
i
am
promised
gain
nay
wealth
and
thou
wilt
be
successful
said
the
other
may
narayun
grant
it
i
will
pray
for
thy
good
fortune
do
so
do
so
good
brahmin
good
seonath
i
will
not
forget
thee
on
my
return
inshalla
i
can
be
grateful
i
will
make
a
nuzzur
through
thee
to
the
temple
you
will
not
fail
to
do
so
i
think
shekhjee
for
ballajee
hath
been
propitious
to
thee
ever
since
thy
nuzzurs
have
been
offered
up
at
his
shrine
but
i
go
to
present
thy
gift
though
it
is
a
small
one
narayun
keep
thee
it
shall
be
doubled
trebled
seonath
i
swear
to
thee
by
alla
i
will
not
forget
when
i
return
thou
goest
well
alla
hafiz
my
friend
awaits
me
he
returned
to
me
rejoice
with
me
my
friend
cried
he
my
kind
meer
sahib
after
all
is
the
lucky
day
my
friend
the
brahmin
sent
one
of
his
disciples
to
say
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
calculations
upon
his
tablets
and
that
the
aspect
of
the
heavens
was
favourable
to
me
for
an
unlimited
period
ah
how
wise
he
is
meer
sabib
and
how
honest
you
called
him
a
rogue
but
see
he
might
have
kept
me
in
suspense
for
a
month
and
refused
to
consult
the
stars
at
all
until
he
had
been
well
paid
well
after
all
it
is
the
power
of
alla
and
doubtless
these
infidels
hold
some
communion
with
him
which
is
denied
to
those
of
the
true
faith
so
it
would
seem
shekhjee
said
i
humouring
him
it
is
no
doubt
wonderful
that
your
friend
for
an
astrologer
is
for
once
honest
of
course
you
paid
him
liberally
for
his
new
discovery
the
merchant
winced
a
trifle
meer
sahib
a
few
pice
to
purchase
oil
for
the
temple
was
all
he
wanted
oh
rare
disinterestedness
cried
i
truly
it
is
grateful
to
the
heart
to
see
such
conduct
in
this
selfish
world
where
every
one
appears
to
strive
how
he
can
overreach
his
neighbour
of
course
he
has
no
prospective
advantage
none
meer
sahib
none
how
could
a
true
believer
have
dealings
or
connection
with
an
infidel
do
i
not
take
advantage
of
his
learning
for
my
own
convenience
and
then
laugh
at
his
beard
and
he
chuckled
liar
said
i
to
myself
as
i
clenched
my
hand
and
ground
my
teeth
thou
shalt
answer
to
alla
for
this
perjury
before
thou
art
many
days
older
verily
this
is
a
meritorious
deed
and
therefore
hast
thou
been
delivered
into
my
hands
a
hajji
too
oh
shame
shame
yet
then
i
remembered
the
arab
verse
which
saith
if
thy
neighbour
hath
performed
the
haj
trust
him
not
and
if
he
hath
done
it
twice
haste
thee
to
remove
thine
abode
from
his
vicinity
good
o
hajji
said
i
and
you
do
right
but
the
night
wanes
you
had
better
make
preparations
for
the
journey
and
let
me
offer
you
counsel
bring
no
one
with
you
but
a
servant
or
two
my
company
is
ample
for
your
protection
i
have
a
small
pal
which
will
hold
us
both
and
above
all
bring
not
your
son
he
will
but
fatigue
himself
for
no
good
purpose
and
be
a
clog
on
our
rapid
movements
for
rapid
they
must
be
i
will
follow
your
advice
in
all
things
meer
sahib
i
shall
bring
no
servants
the
man
who
will
drive
my
spare
tattoo
can
attend
me
when
i
require
it
and
the
less
show
i
make
the
less
i
shall
be
suspected
of
carrying
money
with
me
remember
then
said
i
you
come
to
my
camp
by
the
time
the
rises
we
shall
all
be
ready
for
you
and
the
sun
will
not
be
powerful
ere
we
reach
our
stage
he
promised
to
be
there
by
the
appointed
time
and
i
left
him
i
found
my
trusty
emissary
waiting
for
me
in
my
tent
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
when
he
saw
me
is
he
safe
he
asked
at
length
ah
meer
sahib
i
have
had
great
amusement
as
no
doubt
you
have
also
he
is
he
is
fairly
caught
the
net
is
around
him
one
pull
and
he
is
a
lost
man
and
you
my
faithful
friend
you
have
succeeded
so
that
i
marvel
at
your
success
marvel
not
he
replied
the
task
was
easier
than
i
thought
but
hear
my
adventures
surely
said
i
and
i
called
for
a
chilum
while
he
proceeded
you
remember
when
you
left
me
i
nodded
well
it
was
a
long
time
ere
i
could
find
a
servant
and
in
despair
i
lay
down
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
but
kept
awake
at
last
a
fellow
came
out
a
hindoo
as
luck
would
have
it
and
i
followed
him
thou
direct
me
to
a
kulal
shop
said
i
have
travelled
far
and
my
throat
is
dry
i
saw
that
the
fellow
himself
drank
from
the
colour
of
his
eyes
and
they
sparkled
at
the
mention
of
the
kulal
shop
is
one
close
by
he
replied
will
show
it
said
i
shalt
share
my
potations
well
we
entered
the
shop
and
went
into
the
inner
room
i
called
for
a
bottle
of
liquor
and
paid
for
it
the
place
was
somewhat
dark
and
i
poured
what
i
took
on
the
ground
but
he
drank
every
drop
he
finished
the
bottle
as
though
it
had
been
water
and
i
sent
for
more
at
last
i
began
by
asking
him
who
his
master
was
and
what
service
he
did
and
mashalla
i
heard
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
all
about
him
and
lastly
that
he
was
going
on
a
journey
but
had
been
prevented
by
an
astrologer
having
declared
the
morrow
to
be
an
unlucky
day
in
fine
my
friend
sumbhoo
for
such
was
his
name
got
very
drunk
and
having
told
me
much
of
his
master
private
history
which
did
not
redound
to
his
credit
he
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
and
there
i
left
him
but
not
before
i
had
ascertained
that
the
astrologer
resided
at
a
temple
in
the
next
street
and
that
his
name
was
seonath
i
have
seen
him
said
i
a
tall
fair
man
a
priest
and
stout
enough
for
a
thug
you
saw
him
how
and
where
i
told
him
and
we
had
a
hearty
laugh
as
i
described
the
scene
in
the
and
mimicked
the
cringing
tones
of
the
merchant
and
the
haughty
ones
of
the
brahmin
but
listen
said
laloo
and
wonder
as
i
did
i
soon
found
the
temple
and
the
brahmin
and
accosting
him
i
begged
for
a
charm
against
the
evil
eye
for
my
child
he
looked
at
me
ya
alla
how
he
looked
i
quailed
under
his
gaze
and
my
flesh
crept
as
if
i
were
in
an
ague
fit
for
once
i
was
afraid
for
i
knew
not
the
man
and
yet
he
seemed
as
if
he
could
read
my
heart
me
said
he
would
speak
with
thee
apart
from
these
prying
people
he
spoke
kindly
and
i
followed
him
though
almost
mechanically
he
went
before
me
your
shoes
said
he
place
must
not
be
polluted
it
is
sacred
at
last
we
were
alone
in
a
small
court
where
there
was
a
shrine
of
the
god
again
he
turned
on
me
and
looked
into
my
face
i
really
knew
not
what
to
think
and
oh
how
glad
i
was
when
he
put
an
end
to
my
suspense
by
repeating
our
signal
words
our
signal
yes
meer
sahib
even
so
i
was
as
much
astounded
as
you
are
but
the
mystery
was
soon
solved
he
proved
to
be
a
priest
of
our
holiest
of
temples
bindachul
who
had
travelled
into
these
parts
and
having
picked
up
some
astronomical
lore
at
benares
set
up
here
for
an
astrologer
and
found
the
trade
so
profitable
that
he
has
not
returned
to
bindachul
of
course
i
had
no
reservation
with
him
i
developed
our
plan
from
which
he
at
first
drew
back
but
i
opened
my
purse
and
five
ashruffees
worked
such
a
change
in
his
sentiments
that
he
listened
to
my
words
with
complacency
altered
the
face
of
the
heavens
as
far
as
they
concerned
your
friend
and
in
fine
offered
there
and
then
to
go
and
say
that
his
calculations
were
wrong
and
that
everything
boded
prosperity
to
the
poor
shekh
he
has
not
failed
us
said
i
no
replied
laloo
i
know
that
but
we
have
to
pay
handsomely
he
wanted
a
hundred
rupees
more
but
i
represented
that
we
were
a
large
band
and
there
would
not
be
much
to
divide
and
i
obliged
him
to
be
content
with
a
bhuttote
share
added
to
whatever
a
general
subscription
might
amount
to
when
the
band
should
be
informed
of
the
part
he
had
played
and
he
is
content
you
have
had
the
best

has
he
not
done
the
errand
he
promised
and
when
did
a
brahmin
of
bindachul
ever
break
his
faith
he
dare
not
bhowanee
would
smite
him
on
the
spot
or
kill
him
by
lingering
torments
and
how
i
asked
are
we
to
convey
this
share
to
him
whatever
it
may
turn
out
to
be
easily
enough
we
can
get
a
hoondee
on
this
place
and
send
it
to
him
in
a
letter
or
we
can
despatch
a
man
with
it
true
we
can
said
i
and
so
now
go
repeat
to
the
men
the
lesson
i
taught
them
and
enjoin
them
to
be
circumspect
and
wary
we
have
good
bunij
in
prospect
and
inshalla
we
will
get
it
too
but
i
wish
i
could
see
the
brahmin
who
has
done
us
so
good
a
turn
in
this
matter
let
him
alone
said
he
he
told
me
that
although
he
wished
much
to
see
you
having
often
heard
of
your
conduct
it
was
better
to
avoid
suspicion
and
that
any
open
intercourse
between
him
and
you
would
expose
him
to
the
inquiries
of
those
with
whom
he
was
associated
and
had
better
be
avoided
and
he
is
right

four
days
passed
and
the
merchant
was
still
in
our
company
he
was
slightly
attended
and
we
could
have
terminated
his
existence
whenever
we
pleased
but
we
were
anxious
to
carry
him
on
as
much
of
the
journey
as
we
could
and
to
baffle
any
traces
of
our
route
by
turning
to
the
right
and
left
away
from
the
regular
tracks
and
by
footpaths
and
byways
only
known
to
ourselves
yet
we
had
got
far
enough
and
i
knew
that
the
next
day
march
would
lead
us
through
a
jungle
which
was
one
of
our
favourite
bhils
and
where
i
had
from
the
first
determined
that
he
should
die
we
were
on
the
road
early
on
the
fifth
morning
and
as
before
indeed
as
was
my
wont
i
was
riding
at
the
head
of
my
party
it
was
now
daylight
but
we
were
entering
the
jungle
and
i
was
merry
in
my
heart
to
think
that
he
was
in
my
power
and
that
a
large
and
valuable
booty
would
be
our
prize
in
the
course
of
a
short
hour
when
i
saw
an
animal
move
in
the
bushes
on
my
right
hand
another
instant
and
a
hare
again
crossed
my
path
i
laughed
within
myself
fools
that
they
are
thought
i
these
brethren
of
mine
no
jemadar
but
myself
would
dare
to
pursue
this
track
after
so
dire
an
omen
himself
and
his
whole
band
would
fly
as
though
a
hundred
tigers
were
in
their
path
and
would
leave
their
bunij
to
escape
or
to
follow
them
as
his
destiny
might
guide
him
but
i
i
laugh
at
it
once
i
have
proved
that
the
omen
is
harmless
and
shall
it
deter
me
now
ah
no
no
my
game
is
sure
and
within
my
grasp
and
so
it
was
sahib
we
had
not
gone
a
coss
when
i
saw
the
place
i
had
determined
on
and
there
the
merchant
died
and
his
two
servants
yes
he
died
by
my
own
hand
i
pulled
him
off
his
pony
and
strangled
him
and
the
servants
were
cared
for
by
the
others
but
not
before
one
of
them
had
cut
down
one
of
my
men
for
in
my
eagerness
to
possess
myself
of
the
prize
before
me
i
had
not
seen
that
the
servants
of
the
merchant
could
observe
my
actions
the
poor
fellow
who
had
fallen
was
dreadfully
wounded
yet
he
still
breathed
what
to
do
with
him
i
knew
not
we
could
not
wait
and
to
transport
him
with
us
was
out
of
the
question
what
shall
we
do
with
anundee
said
i
to
laloo
we
are
far
from
our
stage
and
we
can
not
with
our
large
party
say
we
have
fallen
among
thieves
he
solved
my
doubts
at
once
put
him
out
of
his
pain
said
he
the
man
is
dying
what
matters
another
thrust
he
can
be
buried
with
the
rest
the
men
might
not
like
it
if
they
saw
it
but
all
here
are
engaged
and
most
of
the
band
have
gone
on
we
can
wrap
him
up
in
his
sheet
afterwards
i
drew
my
sword
and
stepped
towards
the
dying
wretch
he
looked
supplicatingly
towards
me
and
strove
to
speak
but
my
heart
was
hard
i
was
sickened
by
the
deed
i
had
done
and
i
prayed
alla
to
forgive
me
the
blood
of
the
miserable
creature
wretch
said
i
interrupting
ameer
ali
and
you
murdered
your
own
companion
your
brother
to
whom
you
were
sworn
i
did
sahib
i
did
yet
why
call
it
murder
he
would
have
died
in
a
short
time
i
did
but
rid
him
of
his
misery
it
was
a
foul
deed
ameer
ali
and
one
that
haunts
your
memory
i
doubt
not
sometimes
was
the
careless
answer
of
the
thug
and
i
bade
him
proceed
we
wrapped
the
body
in
the
sheet
which
was
around
its
waist
having
taken
the
money
from
the
waistband
laloo
and
myself
carried
it
to
the
grave
now
nearly
filled
to
the
top
so
he
is
dead
cried
the
lughaees
he
could
not
have
lived
long
after
that
cut
the
fellow
who
gave
it
would
have
done
for
more
of
us
had
not
some
of
us
seized
on
him
but
we
have
laid
him
quietly
he
will
break
no
more
good
men
heads
and
as
for
poor
anundee
he
must
be
buried
with
the
rest
for
to
burn
him
is
impossible
in
this
lonely
place
and
he
buried
they
deepened
the
centre
of
the
pit
put
some
heavy
stones
over
him
and
covered
him
with
earth
and
i
felt
a
load
taken
from
my
heart
as
he
was
covered
from
my
sight
for
ever
only
laloo
knew
what
i
had
done
and
i
knew
him
to
be
faithful
and
silent
nevertheless
i
often
afterwards
wished
either
that
another
had
done
the
deed
or
that
i
had
let
him
die
a
rare
booty
we
had
sahib
after
we
had
eaten
the
goor
at
the
next
village
we
hastened
on
to
the
end
of
the
stage
and
before
we
ungirded
our
loins
i
opened
the
caskets
and
divided
the
spoil
not
only
had
the
merchant
brought
the
necklace
i
have
mentioned
before
but
a
heap
of
unstrung
pearls
and
on
reckoning
up
their
probable
value
we
estimated
the
amount
at
thousand
rupees
now
therefore
we
had
no
inducement
to
tarry
away
from
our
homes
we
needed
no
fresh
adventure
to
enrich
us
and
we
pushed
on
to
jhalone
we
reached
it
in
safety
and
again
i
clasped
azima
to
my
heart
and
rejoiced
to
see
that
my
child
was
well
and
with
a
girl
eagerness
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
her
marriage
ceremony
was
to
take
place
my
father
too
was
well
and
had
reached
jhalone
without
any
adventure
worth
recording
so
at
least
he
told
me
but
of
ganesha
there
was
no
news
save
that
he
had
diverged
to
the
eastward
and
was
supposed
to
have
gone
in
the
direction
of
benares
and
i
little
cared
except
that
the
revenge
for
the
destruction
of
the
moonshee
son
rankled
in
my
heart
and
was
not
forgotten
months
passed
at
my
home
without
care
and
in
peace
alas
now
that
i
think
on
it
i
can
only
compare
the
course
of
that
time
to
the
gentle
stream
of
a
river
which
as
it
winds
among
peaceful
scenes
and
between
green
and
flowery
banks
ruffled
only
by
the
soft
winds
playing
over
its
bosom
is
suddenly
arrested
dashed
among
rocks
and
its
current
changed
to
turmoil
and
furious
contention
with
its
stony
opposers
i
saw
no
mark
of
my
future
lot
no
warning
was
given
to
me
destruction
came
upon
me
in
one
fell
swoop
and
i
was
overwhelmed
i
and
mine
but
for
that
stroke
of
fortune
i
had
lived
till
now
an
honest
and
gentle
life
for
i
abandoned
thuggee
and
the
more
i
experienced
of
the
soothing
pleasures
of
my
home
the
more
i
became
estranged
from
my
habits
of
wandering
and
of
plunder
and
destruction
nor
was
the
least
urgent
reason
in
the
meditated
change
of
my
life
that
i
dreaded
every
day
more
and
more
that
some
unlucky
chance
would
reveal
to
azima
the
dreadful
trade
i
followed
i
could
paint
to
myself
the
effect
it
would
have
on
her
loving
and
gentle
disposition
and
the
prostration
of
every
faculty
of
her
existence
under
the
shock
of
knowing
that
i
was
a
murderer
and
often
as
she
lay
upon
my
heart
in
the
dead
of
night
these
thoughts
have
come
so
thick
on
me
that
could
her
soul
have
held
any
mysterious
communion
with
mine
she
would
have
recoiled
in
horror
from
my
embrace
and
fled
from
me
for
ever
and
these
fancies
recurred
so
frequently
and
forcibly
that
sometimes
i
almost
thought
them
a
warning
of
coming
evil
and
i
had
fully
determined
to
remove
my
abode
and
my
wealth
to
delhi
after
my
daughter
marriage
there
to
reside
for
the
remainder
of
the
days
which
might
be
allotted
to
me
i
have
said
months
passed
without
incident
i
should
have
mentioned
that
an
english
gentleman
some
time
after
my
arrival
came
to
jhalone
and
in
the
many
conferences
he
held
in
secret
with
the
rajah
we
were
given
to
understand
that
a
treaty
of
some
kind
or
other
had
been
made
and
that
he
had
placed
himself
under
the
protection
of
the
english
government
i
thought
not
of
it
yet
even
then
a
system
was
working
silently
yet
surely
which
for
a
time
struck
at
the
power
and
confederacy
of
the
thugs
a
blow
as
severe
nay
more
so
as
being
more
lasting
than
any
they
had
yet
experienced
the
englishman
had
left
jhalone
some
time
and
his
visit
was
nearly
forgotten
by
us
my
daughter
marriage
had
begun
and
everything
was
rejoicing
in
my
house
about
noon
one
day
one
of
the
rajah
hurkaras
came
with
a
message
that
he
required
my
presence
and
my
father
in
the
durbar
on
particular
business
in
vain
was
it
that
i
excused
myself
on
the
plea
of
the
marriage
ceremony
the
messenger
would
take
no
excuse
and
at
last
seeing
no
alternative
we
girded
our
loins
and
accompanied
the
hurkara
we
were
ushered
through
the
various
courts
to
the
dewan
khana
where
the
rajah
sat
in
durbar
surrounded
by
his
mutsuddees
and
soldiers
leaving
our
shoes
at
the
entrance
we
were
as
usual
advancing
towards
his
guddee
to
make
the
customary
salutations
when
a
sudden
rush
was
made
upon
us
from
both
sides
of
the
hall
and
we
were
at
once
seized
and
disarmed
in
vain
i
struggled
with
my
captors
in
vain
i
attempted
to
shake
them
off
by
the
most
strenuous
exertions
it
was
useless
i
was
surrounded
and
overpowered
my
turban
was
torn
rudely
from
my
head
and
my
arms
were
bound
so
tightly
with
it
that
i
thought
the
blood
would
have
burst
from
under
my
nails
i
desisted
at
last
and
remained
passive
in
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
my
hour
is
come
and
my
fate
has
led
me
on
thus
far
to
desert
me
at
last
thought
i
it
is
the
will
of
bhowanee
and
of
alla
why
should
i
resist
seeing
me
quiet
the
rajah
addressed
me
ah
ameer
ali
said
he
what
is
this
i
hear
of
thee
that
thou
art
a
thug
a
common
murderer
can
this
be
true
of
one
who
was
looked
up
to
in
jhalone
as
a
merchant
and
a
respectable
man
what
hast
thou
to
say
speak
man
and
prove
if
thou
canst
to
me
that
the
accusations
i
hear
against
thee
are
false
rajah
said
i
i
know
not
who
hath
poisoned
thy
mind
against
me
or
mine
is
there
any
one
in
your
city
who
can
speak
one
word
against
me
have
i
not
been
fair
and
honourable
in
my
dealings
with
all
and
with
thyself
too
have
not
i
managed
villages
and
brought
them
to
prosperity
from
desolation
and
can
any
one
young
or
old
in
this
durbar
say
that
i
have
ever
wronged
him
or
defrauded
him
of
a
fraction
rajah
none
can
say
this
and
therefore
why
am
i
and
my
old
father
thus
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
the
city
and
torn
from
our
houses
in
the
midst
of
the
rejoicings
of
marriage
accuse
thee
not
said
the
rajah
bhugwan
alone
knows
whether
what
i
hear
is
the
truth
or
not
but
witnesses
are
many
against
thee
and
the
old
man
let
them
speak
and
we
will
afterwards
decide
in
your
case
bring
them
forth
cried
he
to
an
attendant
one
by
one
let
them
give
their
evidence
before
these
unhappy
men
we
desire
no
secrecy
in
this
matter
there
was
a
moment
pause
in
the
assembly
and
every
eye
a
hundred
eyes
were
upon
us
i
looked
to
my
father
to
see
the
effect
his
situation
had
on
him
but
i
read
no
hope
in
the
glance
he
threw
on
me
his
energy
had
deserted
him
and
he
looked
like
a
convicted
felon
long
before
he
was
so
in
reality
he
returned
my
anxious
and
meaning
glances
by
a
stare
of
stupid
apathy
or
extreme
fear
i
know
not
which
and
it
was
pitiable
to
behold
him
for
his
venerable
and
respectable
appearance
but
ill
assorted
with
the
disgraceful
situation
he
was
in
i
turned
away
from
him
to
look
at
the
man
who
entered
and
then
i
felt
that
my
doom
was
sealed
i
have
never
mentioned
him
but
he
had
been
connected
with
our
gang
from
the
first
as
a
tilhaee
or
scout
and
had
afterwards
assisted
as
a
bhuttote
on
many
occasions
his
name
was
sooruj
he
had
accompanied
me
on
all
my
first
expeditions
and
had
served
under
my
father
for
some
time
before
i
became
a
thug
he
therefore
knew
every
particular
of
my
career
and
until
i
became
a
pindharee
described
every
event
with
minuteness
and
fidelity
omitting
not
one
nor
adding
in
any
way
to
those
i
had
been
so
deeply
concerned
in
he
offered
to
point
out
the
spots
upon
which
travellers
had
been
destroyed
declared
the
amount
of
booty
we
had
gained
on
many
occasions
and
ended
by
denouncing
both
my
father
and
myself
as
the
greatest
leaders
in
bundelkhund
as
men
who
could
take
the
field
at
any
time
with
two
hundred
followers
or
more
and
as
cruel
and
remorseless
thugs
he
dared
me
to
disprove
his
words
and
indeed
i
quailed
under
his
accusations
for
they
were
true
and
truth
searches
the
heart
and
overwhelms
the
guilty
but
against
my
father
he
was
the
most
bitter
look
on
him
rajah
cried
he
look
on
this
hoary
wretch
one
would
think
that
old
as
he
is
he
would
have
ceased
to
deprive
his
of
life
that
he
would
have
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
propitiating
bhowanee
by
sacrifices
and
his
own
prophet
by
prayers
yet
it
has
not
been
so
within
the
last
two
months
he
has
returned
from
an
expedition
laden
with
spoil
and
the
last
man
he
strangled
was
one
of
thine
own
subjects
oh
rajah
one
who
was
respected
and
beloved
here
and
whose
bereaved
family
will
rue
this
day
that
i
have
declared
his
fate
in
your
durbar
one
of
my
subjects
cried
the
rajah
thou
canst
not
mean
it
speak
and
let
not
fear
prevent
your
disclosing
the
truth
fear
rajah
i
know
it
not
if
i
feared
him
that
old
man
should
i
have
dared
to
speak
as
i
have
done
listen
you
knew
jeswunt
mul
one
of
the
most
respectable
of
the
shroffs
of
jhalone
knew
him
oh
messenger
of
ill
tidings
jeswunt
mul
is
not
dead
ask
said
the
man
hoarsely
or
stay
ask
the
other
man
you
have
here
let
him
be
brought
forward
he
will
tell
the
tale
i
saw
it
not
but
jeswunt
mul
will
never
speak
more
and
let
those
who
believe
the
good
man
safe
at
saugor
shave
their
mustachios
and
mourn
for
he
will
never
more
be
seen
yes
he
is
dead
and
old
man
looked
on
while
he
writhed
out
his
last
agony
under
the
roomal
of
the
bhuttote
and
he
pointed
at
my
father
while
he
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
grim
and
revengeful
pleasure
there
was
a
general
shudder
through
the
assembly
as
the
deep
tones
of
the
informer
voice
fell
on
the
ears
of
those
who
heard
it
and
jeswunt
mul
dead
was
repeated
by
many
in
an
incredulous
tone
as
they
drew
into
knots
and
whispered
together
nor
was
the
rajah
himself
least
struck
by
the
melancholy
information
he
sat
on
his
musnud
in
silence
though
it
could
be
seen
by
the
working
of
his
features
how
much
he
was
affected
but
he
aroused
himself
at
last
thou
didst
not
then
see
this
murder
said
he
to
the
informer
i
did
not
maha
rajah
but
send
for
bodhee
he
will
relate
the
particulars
bodhee
thought
i
then
there
is
indeed
no
hope
until
his
name
was
mentioned
i
had
a
faint
idea
that
the
accusation
might
be
a
fabricated
one
especially
as
i
had
heard
nothing
of
the
sahoukar
fate
from
my
father
but
bodhee
had
been
with
him
and
he
was
the
chief
of
the
lughaees
and
it
was
more
than
probable
that
he
had
dug
the
grave
for
the
victim
let
bodhee
be
brought
forward
cried
the
rajah
he
came
his
fetters
clanked
as
he
moved
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
advanced
into
the
midst
of
the
durbar
that
he
beheld
my
father
and
myself
bound
and
as
criminals
the
sight
staggered
him
and
well
it
might
he
had
been
trusted
by
us
raised
to
the
rank
he
held
by
my
father
and
ever
treated
by
him
as
a
son
though
he
was
of
a
different
faith
to
ours
his
face
was
convulsed
by
his
emotions
they
might
have
been
those
of
a
faithful
heart
struggling
against
ingratitude
and
i
looked
with
a
breathless
anxiety
to
the
first
words
which
should
fall
from
him
but
before
he
spoke
the
rajah
addressed
him
miserable
wretch
said
he
your
life
has
been
spared
on
the
condition
that
you
speak
the
truth
and
reveal
without
reservation
of
a
single
circumstance
every
deed
of
murder
you
have
been
engaged
in
this
has
been
promised
you
by
the
english
and
you
have
now
to
prove
that
you
will
perform
your
engagement
if
you
do
perform
it
well
if
not
though
the
english
are
your
protectors
i
swear
to
you
that
you
shall
be
dragged
to
death
by
my
elephants
ere
a
ghurree
of
time
has
passed
over
you
bid
the
elephant
be
brought
cried
he
to
an
attendant
and
see
that
the
chains
are
ready
by
gunga
there
will
be
work
for
him
ere
long
and
now
continued
he
to
the
approver
knowest
thou
aught
of
the
death
of
jeswunt
mul
of
this
town
he
who
used
to
manage
my
private
affairs
or
if
he
indeed
be
dead
speak
and
remember
that
truth
alone
can
save
you
there
was
a
breathless
silence
my
father
gazed
at
the
informer
with
an
intense
anxiety
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
thought
one
word
from
him
would
seal
his
fate
for
ever
or
that
should
he
deny
the
deed
he
would
escape
earnestly
imploringly
he
looked
at
him
and
the
informer
was
well
nigh
overcome
he
trembled
in
every
limb
and
the
big
drops
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
face
while
the
veins
of
his
forehead
swelled
almost
to
bursting
speak
bodhee
said
my
father
in
a
hollow
voice
yet
still
he
smiled
speak
and
tell
the
rajah
that
his
poor
servant
ismail
is
not
guilty
of
this
deed
silence
exclaimed
the
rajah
gag
him
if
he
attempts
to
utter
a
word
to
influence
the
informer
we
will
do
justice
in
this
matter
and
you
meer
sahib
turning
to
a
person
who
was
seated
near
him
you
shall
be
able
to
tell
the
that
justice
can
be
done
in
the
durbar
of
jhalone
bring
up
the
elephant
he
cried
to
the
attendants
and
do
you
bodhee
look
your
last
on
the
earth
and
sky
for
by
gunga
i
swear
thou
art
nigh
to
death
if
thou
deceivest
me
i
read
it
in
thy
face
that
this
matter
is
known
to
thee
but
still
bodhee
hesitated
there
was
evidently
a
struggle
within
him
whether
he
should
die
in
defence
of
his
old
protector
or
betray
him
to
save
his
own
life
for
a
moment
the
former
feeling
prevailed
he
turned
to
the
rajah
and
said
distinctly
and
firmly
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
maha
rajah
i
know
nothing
of
this
matter
of
other
murders
i
can
tell
you
but
i
know
nought
of
this
he
lies
said
the
other
approver
he
was
with
ismail
jemadar
he
is
afraid
to
speak
out
and
has
lied
to
you
o
prince
you
hear
him
cried
the
rajah
to
bodhee
you
hear
what
your
fellow
thug
says
yet
much
as
you
have
deserved
death
i
give
you
a
few
moments
more
the
shadow
of
the
verandah
is
now
close
on
my
musnud
till
it
reaches
it
thou
shalt
live
beyond
it
one
breadth
and
you
die
there
was
not
an
eye
in
the
crowd
that
was
not
fixed
on
the
advancing
shadow
barely
a
hand
breadth
of
light
remained
and
the
thug
gazed
on
it
as
though
he
were
fascinated
by
the
eye
of
a
tiger
my
father
oh
he
was
fearful
to
look
on
his
eyes
were
glazed
his
lips
were
tightened
across
his
teeth
fear
was
depicted
in
his
countenance
in
stronger
lines
than
i
had
ever
before
seen
i
could
not
look
on
him
his
face
was
altered
and
his
usual
bland
expression
had
been
usurped
by
that
i
have
described
i
felt
sick
i
could
have
died
i
thought
and
would
that
i
died
to
have
been
spared
what
followed
fool
cried
the
other
approver
will
you
sacrifice
your
life
for
those
who
will
be
instantly
put
to
death
he
spoke
in
ramasee
the
words
rallied
the
man
to
whom
he
addressed
them
and
they
saved
him
pardon
pardon
he
cried
o
mighty
prince
i
have
told
lies
jeswunt
mul
is
indeed
dead
these
hands
dug
his
grave
and
bore
his
yet
warm
body
to
it
ai
bhugwan
ai
cried
the
rajah
and
is
it
even
so
my
poor
friend
and
art
thou
dead
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
wept
this
is
womanly
said
he
rallying
himself
proceed
o
kumbukht
let
me
know
all
and
what
share
had
in
it
we
met
the
sahoukar
at
said
the
thug
ismail
well
knew
that
if
we
were
all
seen
by
him
he
would
suspect
us
so
he
sent
the
greater
part
of
the
band
out
of
the
village
and
prevailed
upon
jeswunt
mul
to
come
and
sleep
in
our
camp
instead
of
remaining
where
he
was
he
went
to
the
village
and
brought
him
away
himself
else
he
would
not
have
come
the
grave
was
dug
long
before
he
arrived
and
he
had
not
been
an
hour
with
us
after
the
sun
had
set
when
he
was
strangled
in
the
jemadar
presence
by
two
bhuttotes
and
his
two
servants
shared
the
same
fate
i
buried
them
all
the
sahoukar
pony
we
sold
the
next
day
for
rupees
and
we
got
but
little
else
for
he
had
no
money
but
in
hoondees
which
we
burned
enough
enough
said
the
rajah
this
is
ample
proof
nay
if
your
greatness
requires
more
proof
i
can
give
you
some
now
continued
the
approver
look
at
the
jemadar
hand
he
wears
on
it
a
ring
he
took
from
the
body
himself
and
it
may
be
recognized
even
by
you
maha
rajah
my
heart
sank
within
me
at
this
new
and
desperate
stroke
of
fortune
i
saw
the
ring
torn
from
my
father
finger
all
examined
it
a
sahoukar
who
was
in
the
assembly
declared
it
to
have
belonged
to
jeswunt
mul
and
more
than
all
his
name
was
engraven
on
its
inner
surface
enough
again
cried
the
rajah
i
know
it
myself
i
could
have
sworn
to
that
diamond
among
a
thousand
away
with
him
chain
him
to
the
elephant
let
him
be
dragged
through
the
town
and
proclamation
made
that
he
was
a
thug
stay
cried
the
syud
who
had
not
as
yet
spoken
he
may
have
something
to
urge
in
his
defence
ask
him
and
hear
him
speak
cried
the
rajah
to
my
miserable
father
speak
o
kumbukht
and
then
my
father
proud
spirit
broke
out
with
the
certainty
of
death
before
his
eyes
he
quailed
not
while
hope
remained
of
life
he
had
clung
to
it
as
every
man
will
and
when
i
had
expected
a
grovelling
entreaty
for
his
life
to
be
spared
from
his
previous
demeanour
he
asked
it
not
but
gloried
in
the
cause
for
which
he
died
yes
said
he
drawing
himself
up
while
his
eye
glistened
proudly
i
scorn
to
die
with
a
lie
upon
my
lips
i
killed
jeswunt
mul
because
he
was
a
villain
as
you
are
rajah
because
he
employed
thugs
and
would
not
reward
them
but
wrung
from
them
every
rupee
he
could
as
you
do
i
have
murdered
hundreds
of
men
because
they
were
given
into
my
hands
by
alla
but
i
never
destroyed
one
with
the
satisfaction
i
did
your
friend
ay
you
were
friends
and
brothers
in
guilt
and
you
know
it
my
life
i
care
not
for
it
what
has
an
old
man
to
do
with
life
his
enjoyments
are
gone
his
existence
is
a
burthen
to
him
a
short
time
and
nature
would
have
claimed
me
you
have
anticipated
the
period
yet
o
rajah
bhowanee
will
question
you
for
this
deed
for
the
destruction
of
her
votary
my
blood
be
on
your
head
and
the
curse
of
a
dying
man
be
with
you
you
have
deceived
me
robbed
me
shared
my
spoils
taken
the
produce
of
murder
nay
be
not
impatient
you
know
it
is
the
truth
and
that
alla
who
is
the
judge
of
all
knows
it
also
he
will
cast
your
portion
in
jehanum
as
a
kafir
and
bhowanee
will
rejoice
that
the
destroyer
of
her
votary
writhes
in
the
torments
of
the
damned
gag
him
strike
the
kafir
mouth
with
a
shoe
roared
the
rajah
in
a
fury
more
like
that
of
a
beast
than
a
man
as
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
away
with
him
and
let
his
son
look
on
his
dying
agony
and
they
dragged
us
both
forth
i
should
not
say
my
father
for
his
step
was
firm
i
struggled
against
my
tormentors
but
it
availed
me
not
one
word
my
father
cried
i
to
him
as
we
were
brought
near
each
other
wilt
thou
not
speak
to
thy
son
he
turned
his
head
and
a
tear
stood
in
his
eye
i
leave
thee
ameer
ali
but
thou
knowest
a
believer
paradise
and
the
joys
which
await
him
the
seventy
virgins
and
everlasting
youth
thou
art
not
my
son
but
i
have
loved
thee
as
one
and
may
alla
keep
thee
no
more
cried
the
rough
soldiers
striking
him
on
the
mouth
and
dragging
him
forward
revenge
me
exclaimed
my
father
in
ramasee
tell
the
english
of
that
monster
conduct
to
us
and
when
he
is
torn
from
his
seat
of
pride
my
soul
will
be
happy
in
paradise
he
spoke
no
more
i
was
held
forcibly
so
that
i
saw
the
end
of
that
butchery
they
secured
him
by
a
chain
round
his
loins
to
the
of
the
elephant
and
they
tied
his
hands
behind
him
so
that
he
could
not
save
himself
by
clinging
to
it
he
still
continued
repeating
the
kulma
but
now
all
was
ready
the
mahout
drove
his
ankoos
into
the
head
of
the
noble
beast
which
uttering
a
loud
scream
dashed
forward
a
few
steps
and
my
father
soul
must
have
been
in
paradise
chapter
xlvi
sahib
can
i
describe
to
you
the
passions
which
then
burned
in
my
heart
i
can
not
a
thousand
thoughts
whirled
through
my
brain
till
i
thought
myself
mad
perhaps
i
was
revenge
for
my
father
was
uppermost
and
oh
that
i
could
have
got
loose
by
alla
unarmed
as
i
was
methinks
i
would
have
sprung
on
the
rajah
and
strangled
him
but
resistance
was
unavailing
the
more
i
struggled
the
tighter
my
arms
were
bound
until
they
swelled
so
that
the
pain
became
excruciating
and
i
well
nigh
sunk
under
it
i
suffered
my
guards
to
lead
me
away
from
the
durbar
i
was
thrust
into
a
vile
hole
and
at
last
my
arms
were
unbound
that
day
alla
how
it
passed
men
gazed
at
me
in
my
cage
as
though
i
had
been
a
tiger
and
mocked
and
derided
me
the
boys
of
the
town
hooted
me
and
thrust
sticks
at
me
through
the
iron
gratings
one
and
all
reviled
me
in
the
most
opprobrious
terms
they
could
devise
me
the
respectable
nay
the
wealthy
to
whom
they
had
bowed
before
when
i
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
the
rajah
favour
but
i
was
degraded
now
alas
my
dreams
my
forebodings
had
come
to
pass
they
had
been
indefinite
shadows
this
was
the
reality
alla
alla
i
raved
i
called
upon
azima
name
i
implored
those
who
still
lingered
about
my
prison
to
fly
and
bring
me
news
of
her
and
to
comfort
her
and
i
cursed
them
when
they
derided
me
and
mocked
my
cries
azima
the
name
that
might
not
have
been
breathed
by
mortal
out
of
the
precincts
of
my
zenana
became
a
word
in
the
mouths
of
the
rabble
and
they
jested
on
it
they
loaded
it
with
obscene
abuse
and
i
heard
it
all
in
vain
i
strove
to
stop
my
ears
it
provoked
them
the
more
they
shouted
it
close
to
the
iron
bars
and
spat
at
me
night
came
and
i
was
left
in
my
loneliness
i
should
have
been
in
her
fond
embrace
now
i
shared
the
company
of
the
rat
the
lizard
and
the
scorpion
it
was
in
vain
that
i
courted
sleep
to
steep
my
senses
in
a
temporary
oblivion
of
their
misery
my
frame
was
too
strong
and
my
anguish
too
great
for
it
to
come
to
me
i
wrestled
with
my
agony
but
i
overcame
it
not
and
i
had
to
drink
the
bitter
cup
to
the
dregs
at
last
the
morning
broke
i
performed
the
namaz
the
dust
of
the
floor
served
me
instead
of
sand
or
water
for
my
ablutions
water
i
had
none
i
had
begged
for
it
for
my
mouth
was
parched
and
dry
with
anxiety
yet
no
one
gave
it
again
the
court
was
filled
old
and
young
women
and
children
all
came
to
look
at
the
syud
to
look
at
ameer
ali
the
thug
to
deride
him
and
torment
him
but
i
was
now
sullen
like
a
tiger
when
his
first
rage
after
he
has
been
entrapped
has
subsided
i
cowered
into
the
corner
of
my
cell
and
covered
my
face
with
my
waistband
nor
heeded
their
savage
unfeeling
mirth
nor
the
bitter
words
they
poured
out
against
me
in
vain
was
it
that
i
now
and
then
looked
around
to
see
whether
one
kind
pitying
glance
rested
on
me
alas
not
one
every
face
was
familiar
to
me
but
the
eyes
either
spoke
a
brutal
satisfaction
at
my
sufferings
or
turned
on
me
with
the
cold
leaden
stare
of
indifference
i
tried
to
speak
several
times
but
every
murmur
was
hailed
with
shouts
from
the
rabble
before
me
and
my
throat
was
parched
and
my
tongue
swelled
from
raging
thirst
the
whole
day
passed
i
had
no
food
no
water
it
was
in
the
height
of
the
burning
season
and
i
who
had
been
pampered
with
luxuries
who
in
my
own
abode
should
have
drunk
of
refreshing
sherbets
prepared
by
azima
was
denied
a
drop
of
water
to
cool
my
burning
throat
in
vain
i
implored
those
nearest
to
me
in
words
that
would
have
moved
aught
but
hearts
of
stone
to
intercede
with
the
jemadar
who
guarded
my
prison
to
allow
me
a
draught
of
the
pure
element
i
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
scorching
blast
that
whistled
into
my
cage
bringing
with
it
clouds
of
dust
which
were
increased
by
the
unfeeling
boys
when
they
saw
i
shrank
from
them
thus
the
day
passed
evening
came
and
still
no
water
no
relief
no
inquiry
into
my
condition
had
i
been
placed
there
to
die
and
no
sooner
had
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
than
i
brooded
over
it
yes
i
was
to
die
to
expire
of
thirst
and
hunger
and
then
oh
how
i
envied
my
father
fate
his
was
a
quick
transition
from
the
sorrows
and
suffering
he
had
undergone
during
one
short
hour
to
paradise
and
the
houris
and
from
evening
night
i
had
watched
the
declining
sun
till
its
last
fiery
and
scorching
beams
fell
no
longer
on
my
i
watched
the
reddened
west
until
no
glare
remained
and
one
by
one
the
stars
shone
out
dimly
through
the
thick
and
heated
air
and
i
thought
i
should
see
the
blessed
day
no
more
for
i
was
sick
and
exhausted
even
to
death
i
lay
me
down
and
moaned
in
my
agony
of
spirit
and
of
body
and
at
last
sleep
came
to
my
relief
for
a
time
all
was
oblivion
but
horrible
dreams
began
to
crowd
my
prison
with
unsightly
shapes
and
harrowing
visions
my
life
passed
as
though
in
review
before
me
and
the
features
of
many
i
had
strangled
rose
up
in
fierce
mockery
against
me
faces
with
protruding
tongues
and
eyes
even
as
i
had
left
them
strangled
why
describe
them
to
you
sahib
why
detain
you
with
a
description
of
the
horrors
of
the
scenes
which
rose
to
my
distempered
fancy
and
at
last
woke
me
burning
as
though
a
fire
raged
in
my
bowels
and
would
not
be
quenched
but
morning
broke
at
last
and
the
cool
air
once
more
played
over
my
heated
and
fevered
frame
and
refreshed
me
yet
i
was
still
in
agony
who
can
describe
the
sufferings
of
thirst
hunger
i
felt
not
thirst
consumed
me
and
dried
up
my
bowels
how
anxiously
and
impatiently
i
looked
for
the
first
man
who
should
enter
the
court
where
my
prison
was
one
came
he
passed
through
and
heeded
not
my
piteous
cries
another
and
another
none
looked
on
me
and
again
i
thought
i
was
to
die
another
came
i
called
and
he
turned
to
regard
me
he
was
one
that
i
knew
one
who
had
eaten
of
my
bread
and
my
salt
and
had
been
employed
about
my
house
and
he
had
pity
he
had
a
remembrance
of
what
i
had
done
for
him
he
came
and
looked
on
me
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
started
for
my
voice
was
hollow
and
thin
and
hoarse
water
cried
i
for
the
sake
of
the
blessed
prophet
for
the
sake
of
your
mother
one
drop
of
water
i
have
tasted
none
since
i
was
confined
alas
said
he
in
a
low
tone
how
can
it
be
meer
sahib
the
rajah
has
threatened
any
one
with
death
who
speaks
to
you
or
brings
you
food
again
i
implored
and
i
who
had
been
his
master
prostrated
myself
on
the
ground
and
rubbed
my
forehead
in
the
dust
he
was
moved
he
had
pity
and
went
to
fetch
some
fortunately
no
one
saw
him
and
he
brought
a
small
earthen
pot
full
which
i
drank
as
though
it
had
been
that
of
the
well
of
paradise
again
and
again
he
took
it
and
refilled
it
and
at
last
he
left
me
but
not
before
he
had
promised
to
visit
me
in
the
night
bring
me
a
cake
of
bread
if
he
could
and
more
than
all
news
of
azima
and
of
my
house
the
next
day
passed
and
i
had
no
food
i
treasured
up
the
water
which
had
been
left
with
me
and
sipped
it
now
and
then
but
by
nightfall
again
i
was
in
torment
yet
i
had
hopes
for
i
knew
that
the
young
man
would
not
deceive
me
he
had
sworn
by
his
mother
head
to
bring
me
food
and
he
could
not
break
his
oath
and
he
came
i
had
sat
watching
with
that
anxiety
which
can
only
be
known
by
those
who
have
been
in
a
situation
like
mine
listening
to
every
distant
footfall
to
every
noise
as
though
it
were
the
step
of
him
i
looked
for
i
have
said
he
came
he
was
muffled
in
a
blanket
and
had
stolen
in
unobserved
by
the
lazy
sentinel
at
the
gate
he
brought
me
food
a
few
coarse
cakes
and
an
earthen
pot
of
milk
eat
said
he
in
a
low
tone
i
will
sit
here
and
will
tell
you
the
news
you
bade
me
inquire
for
afterwards
i
was
ravenous
and
i
ate
coarse
bread
such
as
i
should
have
loathed
three
days
before
was
now
a
luxury
sweet
and
grateful
i
ate
it
drank
the
milk
and
was
thankful
and
i
called
him
and
blessed
him
for
his
venturous
daring
and
for
his
gratitude
to
one
who
could
no
longer
do
him
a
kind
turn
and
the
news
gholam
nubbee
can
you
tell
me
aught
of
and
my
child
my
news
is
bad
meer
sahib
and
i
am
the
unwilling
messenger
of
tidings
which
will
grieve
your
soul
and
add
to
your
misery
say
on
said
i
tell
me
the
worst
tell
me
she
is
dead
and
you
will
only
say
what
my
soul
has
forewarned
me
of
he
paused
for
a
while
you
must
know
it
sooner
or
later
meer
sahib
she
is
dead
and
my
child
she
is
with
the
good
moola
who
protected
your
wife
when
she
had
no
longer
a
house
to
cover
her
and
who
performed
the
last
rites
of
our
faith
to
her
when
she
was
dead
no
home
cried
i
they
did
not
drive
her
forth
they
did
meer
sahib
the
rajah
sent
soldiers
your
house
was
stripped
of
everything
and
your
gold
and
silver
they
say
was
a
prize
he
little
expected
your
wife
and
child
were
turned
into
the
street
with
only
the
clothes
they
had
upon
their
persons
but
to
her
it
little
mattered
for
i
have
heard
she
never
spoke
from
the
time
she
knew
of
your
father
fate
and
the
cause
of
your
imprisonment
they
say
she
sat
in
stupor
like
a
breathing
corpse
without
speaking
a
word
to
say
where
her
pain
was
enough
said
i
go
may
alla
keep
you
i
would
now
be
alone
for
grief
sits
heavy
on
me
then
she
was
dead
my
azima
my
beloved
she
for
whom
i
could
myself
have
died
she
whom
i
had
loved
as
man
can
only
love
once
she
was
dead
she
had
known
that
i
was
a
thug
and
that
had
killed
her
it
was
well
better
far
that
she
should
have
died
than
lingered
on
to
be
scoffed
at
and
insulted
as
the
wife
of
one
who
was
now
a
convicted
murderer
had
she
lived
i
could
never
have
dared
to
approach
her
for
she
was
pure
and
i
i
may
say
i
almost
rejoiced
at
her
death
sahib
i
did
not
grieve
as
i
should
have
done
had
the
blow
fallen
on
me
while
i
was
yet
in
prosperity
then
it
would
have
been
hard
indeed
to
bear
but
now
i
was
altered
and
she
was
dead
and
again
i
say
it
was
well
alla
in
his
mercy
had
taken
her
from
her
scene
of
suffering
almost
before
she
knew
to
its
full
extent
the
horrible
reality
and
my
child
too
was
safe
she
was
in
friendly
hands
and
the
moola
would
be
a
father
to
her
the
day
after
the
nocturnal
visit
of
my
humble
friend
food
was
allowed
me
it
was
scanty
to
be
sure
but
still
i
existed
though
worn
down
by
sufferings
which
i
have
no
words
to
express
to
a
shadow
of
what
i
was
three
months
passed
thus
and
they
appeared
to
me
like
years
when
i
looked
back
on
them
at
the
end
of
this
time
i
was
taken
to
the
rajah
durbar
few
were
the
words
he
spoke
to
me
but
those
were
bitter
ones
for
he
had
shared
my
spoil
taxed
me
for
protection
and
after
putting
my
father
to
death
he
had
plundered
my
home
and
his
booty
was
the
accumulation
of
mine
for
years
past
i
say
my
father
and
yet
he
had
told
me
he
was
not
my
parent
but
what
mattered
that
now
he
was
dead
and
the
mystery
of
my
birth
if
any
had
ever
existed
was
gone
with
him
what
mattered
it
too
who
was
my
father
i
was
alone
in
the
world
not
a
tie
save
one
bound
me
to
existence
my
daughter
was
with
strangers
and
in
a
few
years
she
would
forget
me
truly
i
might
say
i
was
alone
i
was
in
the
rajah
durbar
i
had
no
friend
no
one
of
all
those
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
who
had
formerly
courted
me
eaten
of
my
bread
and
flattered
me
that
i
was
yet
to
rise
to
greatness
under
his
patronage
not
one
spoke
for
me
not
one
interceded
to
avert
my
shame
the
rajah
spoke
to
me
ameer
ali
said
he
i
had
trusted
thee
i
had
thought
thee
honest
how
he
lied
as
he
spoke
i
had
believed
thee
a
rich
and
fortunate
merchant
but
o
man
thou
hast
deceived
me
and
not
me
alone
but
thousands
and
thou
art
a
thug
and
a
murderer
still
because
i
have
a
lingering
sentiment
of
kindness
towards
thee
i
do
not
seek
thy
death
justice
has
been
satisfied
in
the
destruction
of
the
hoary
villain
who
made
thee
what
thou
art
and
who
led
one
who
might
have
been
an
ornament
to
the
world
to
be
a
wretch
upon
whose
head
is
the
blood
of
hundreds
yes
ameer
ali
i
speak
truth
and
thou
knowest
it
and
though
i
desire
not
thy
death
yet
thou
canst
not
be
released
without
a
mark
on
thy
brow
that
men
may
know
and
beware
of
throw
him
down
cried
he
to
the
attendants
and
let
him
be
branded
they
threw
me
down
sahib
what
could
my
attenuated
and
wasted
frame
do
against
men
who
had
suffered
no
misery
like
mine
i
struggled
yet
it
was
unavailing
they
held
my
arms
and
legs
and
head
and
a
pice
was
pressed
upon
my
forehead
it
was
held
there
as
it
burnt
down
to
the
bone
ay
my
very
brain
seemed
to
be
scorched
and
withered
by
the
burning
copper
they
took
it
off
and
raised
me
up
alla
alla
the
agony
that
i
endured
the
agony
of
pain
and
more
than
that
of
shame
to
be
branded
publicly
that
the
world
might
think
me
a
thief
to
have
a
mark
set
on
my
forehead
that
i
must
carry
to
my
grave
a
mark
only
set
on
the
vile
and
on
the
outcasts
from
society
sahib
it
was
a
bitter
cup
to
quaff
away
with
him
cried
the
rajah
away
with
him
release
him
at
the
boundary
of
my
territory
and
mark
me
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
me
i
have
given
thee
thy
life
ameer
ali
go
and
be
wise
learn
by
what
has
happened
to
be
an
honest
man
for
the
future
and
above
all
remember
that
if
ever
thou
art
seen
in
jhalone
again
or
in
any
of
my
towns
or
villages
nothing
will
be
able
to
save
thee
from
the
feet
of
an
elephant
he
rose
and
strode
out
of
the
durbar
and
in
pain
and
misery
i
was
conducted
in
two
days
to
the
frontier
of
his
country
and
unbound
two
rupees
were
given
to
me
and
again
the
wide
and
cruel
world
was
before
me
i
hurried
from
my
late
keepers
i
bound
my
turban
over
my
still
burning
and
aching
brow
so
that
man
might
not
see
my
shame
and
took
the
road
before
me
i
wandered
almost
unconscious
of
anything
save
the
pain
i
was
suffering
until
night
fell
around
me
and
i
directed
my
steps
to
a
village
the
lights
of
which
were
a
short
distance
before
me
exchanging
one
of
my
rupees
i
sat
down
at
the
shop
of
a
bhutteara
and
satisfied
my
craving
appetite
there
i
slept
and
when
i
arose
i
was
refreshed
and
again
believed
myself
to
be
ameer
ali
the
morning
breeze
blew
fresh
on
my
face
as
i
took
my
way
out
of
the
town
the
refreshing
rest
of
the
night
had
invigorated
me
and
i
bounded
along
with
a
light
heart
yes
with
a
light
heart
for
i
was
free
i
had
no
thought
for
the
past
now
it
was
my
fate
which
had
been
fulfilled
what
had
been
written
in
my
destiny
had
come
to
pass
as
i
proceeded
a
jackass
brayed
on
my
right
hand
and
i
hailed
the
favourable
omen
with
a
joy
i
can
feebly
express
yes
great
bhowanee
mother
of
men
cried
i
aloud
i
answer
to
thy
omen
i
am
ready
and
again
devoted
to
thy
service
i
have
sinned
against
thee
i
had
wilfully
avoided
thy
warning
omens
led
on
by
an
irresistible
destiny
and
by
a
proud
heart
i
have
been
punished
and
have
bought
a
dear
experience
but
henceforward
no
votary
of
thine
breathing
shall
excel
ameer
ali
in
devotion
to
thee
and
therefore
great
goddess
vouchsafe
the
thibao
and
pilhaoo
and
they
were
granted
the
omen
on
the
right
was
followed
by
that
on
the
left
and
i
felt
that
i
was
pardoned
and
again
accepted
as
a
thug
and
so
you
believe
ameer
ali
said
i
that
your
not
observing
the
omens
in
the
instances
you
related
was
the
cause
of
your
father
death
and
your
misfortunes
assuredly
sahib
i
was
a
sceptic
till
then
as
i
have
told
you
but
i
was
now
no
longer
one
had
i
not
cause
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
omens
and
had
i
obeyed
them
then
should
i
have
the
heavy
crime
i
had
committed
still
rooted
in
my
heart
no
no
omens
can
not
dare
not
be
disobeyed
and
i
have
never
known
an
instance
in
which
they
were
or
where
a
band
had
been
led
to
destroy
a
person
against
the
wishes
of
bhowanee
that
they
were
not
all
punished
by
her
vengeance
either
with
domestic
misfortune
imprisonment
or
death
ask
any
thug
you
know
and
he
will
tell
you
the
same
i
never
doubted
omens
afterwards
and
have
allowed
some
rich
prizes
to
escape
me
because
i
feared
that
they
were
not
completely
propitious
well
sahib
to
continue
i
pressed
forward
i
again
untied
my
roomal
for
that
had
never
quitted
my
waist
and
i
welcomed
it
to
my
grasp
as
i
should
have
done
the
embrace
of
an
old
and
valued
friend
with
such
omens
thought
i
i
can
not
be
unsuccessful
and
over
any
single
traveller
were
he
roostum
himself
i
can
gain
a
victory
i
had
but
one
rupee
and
some
pice
my
clothes
were
in
rags
about
me
and
i
must
have
others
before
i
could
venture
to
associate
myself
with
thugs
and
hope
to
lead
them
but
i
travelled
long
and
met
no
person
alone
and
when
noon
came
and
the
sun
heat
had
overcome
me
i
lay
down
under
a
tree
by
the
road
side
near
which
was
a
well
and
having
washed
and
bathed
and
said
the
namaz
i
waited
to
see
what
chance
would
throw
in
my
way
there
i
sat
a
long
time
but
no
one
passed
me
and
overcome
by
fatigue
i
dropped
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
a
touch
from
some
one
and
looking
up
i
beheld
a
mussulman
gazing
upon
me
i
arose
rapidly
and
returned
his
salam
aleikoom
as
kindly
as
he
had
given
it
fortunately
my
face
remained
well
wrapped
up
and
the
brand
on
my
forehead
could
not
be
seen
he
took
me
to
be
a
traveller
like
himself
and
as
he
was
weary
he
sat
down
and
we
entered
into
conversation
such
as
usually
passes
between
persons
situated
as
we
were
after
he
had
been
seated
for
a
few
minutes
he
loosed
a
small
wallet
from
his
shoulder
and
opening
it
displayed
some
cakes
and
mango
pickle
to
which
he
seemed
to
be
inclined
to
do
ample
justice
but
seeing
that
i
looked
wistfully
at
them
he
invited
me
to
join
his
repast
which
i
was
right
glad
to
do
as
i
had
fasted
since
the
morning
when
we
had
finished
our
meal
he
said
to
me
meer
sahib
you
say
there
is
no
water
for
some
coss
in
the
direction
i
am
going
and
therefore
if
you
will
kindly
watch
my
clothes
and
arms
i
will
bathe
in
this
well
surely
i
replied
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
be
gone
and
you
will
not
delay
me
as
i
said
it
he
began
to
strip
and
taking
with
him
a
lota
he
descended
the
steps
of
the
well
and
i
soon
after
heard
the
splashing
of
the
water
as
he
poured
it
over
himself
now
is
my
time
thought
i
he
will
be
defenceless
and
will
fall
an
easy
prey
to
me
and
i
prepared
my
roomal
for
work
he
soon
returned
and
began
to
dress
i
loitered
near
him
till
i
saw
him
take
up
his
garment
and
put
both
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
to
draw
it
over
him
it
was
a
capital
opportunity
and
i
closed
behind
him
as
if
to
assist
him
he
turned
to
me
and
as
he
had
just
accomplished
his
purpose
i
had
finished
mine
the
roomal
was
about
his
neck
and
in
a
few
moments
he
was
dead
at
my
feet
i
had
no
time
to
lose
so
hastily
stripping
the
band
from
his
waist
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
money
i
dragged
the
body
to
the
edge
of
the
well
and
threw
it
in
i
then
arranged
his
clothes
at
the
head
of
the
steps
as
though
he
had
taken
them
off
to
bathe
and
left
them
there
his
lota
i
left
also
with
them
and
taking
up
his
sword
and
shield
i
girded
the
first
to
my
waist
and
the
shield
to
my
back
and
pursued
my
way
at
as
quick
a
pace
as
i
could
no
one
will
imagine
he
has
been
murdered
thought
i
the
clothes
on
the
brink
of
the
well
will
cause
it
to
be
supposed
that
he
died
in
the
water
and
i
chuckled
over
my
success
and
strode
along
joyfully
but
the
more
to
avoid
detection
i
struck
off
from
the
road
i
was
travelling
and
seeing
the
groves
and
white
temple
of
a
village
at
some
distance
i
bent
my
steps
towards
it
there
i
purchased
some
goor
and
ate
the
tupounee
as
a
good
thug
ought
to
do
and
after
that
i
opened
the
humeana
to
see
what
my
good
fortune
had
sent
me
and
so
you
murdered
the
first
man
who
had
shown
you
any
kindness
after
your
misfortunes
oh
ameer
ali
you
are
indeed
a
villain
you
ate
of
his
bread
and
salt
and
murdered
him
the
recompense
of
a
thug
certainly
but
what
could
i
do
sahib
i
should
have
starved
most
likely
had
i
not
killed
him
besides
he
was
the
first
traveller
i
met
after
those
good
omens
he
was
neither
blind
nor
lame
assuredly
therefore
he
was
bunij
it
must
have
been
his
fate
to
die
or
i
should
not
have
gone
to
sleep
under
that
tree
had
i
met
him
in
the
road
i
should
have
hesitated
to
attack
him
indeed
unarmed
as
i
was
i
dared
not
have
done
so
but
as
i
was
saying
i
examined
the
humeana
i
found
in
it
nineteen
rupees
a
gold
and
two
gold
rings
for
the
fingers
which
were
worth
at
least
forty
rupees
i
cried
this
is
rare
fortune
here
is
enough
to
last
me
for
three
months
and
to
provide
me
with
new
clothes
and
it
will
be
hard
but
in
that
time
i
find
out
some
of
my
brethren
i
searched
around
the
village
to
endeavour
to
find
some
traces
of
thugs
in
the
mango
and
tamarind
groves
by
which
it
was
environed
and
though
i
discovered
some
with
the
peculiar
marks
of
my
brethren
in
them
yet
they
were
old
the
rain
had
more
than
half
washed
them
away
and
the
marks
would
have
been
undistinguishable
to
a
less
experienced
thug
than
myself
i
could
discover
no
further
clue
from
them
though
i
walked
for
some
time
in
the
direction
they
pointed
wandering
along
the
next
day
i
reached
calpee
on
the
jumna
and
sitting
one
morning
at
the
shop
of
a
some
persons
stopped
at
it
and
talking
among
themselves
i
understood
that
they
were
going
to
chutterpoor
chutterpoor
thought
i
what
an
owl
i
have
been
there
must
be
thugs
there
and
i
had
forgotten
it
so
i
immediately
determined
if
possible
to
accompany
them
i
watched
them
to
a
bunnea
empty
shop
before
which
in
the
street
were
tied
four
tattoos
and
some
bullocks
and
without
ceremony
i
told
them
i
had
overheard
their
conversation
that
i
was
also
going
to
the
town
to
which
they
were
journeying
and
if
they
would
allow
me
and
pardon
my
intrusion
i
should
be
glad
to
travel
in
their
company
as
i
was
alone
knew
not
the
road
and
was
afraid
of
robbers
since
you
are
alone
you
may
come
and
welcome
said
the
man
i
addressed
but
we
are
going
by
bandah
which
is
not
exactly
in
the
direct
road
to
chutterpoor
and
our
business
may
detain
us
there
a
day
or
two
if
therefore
delay
is
of
no
consequence
to
you
come
with
us
you
seem
to
be
a
soldier
and
we
are
poor
merchants
who
would
be
glad
of
your
protection
such
as
i
am
good
sir
said
i
i
am
at
your
service
and
will
gladly
accompany
you
to
bandah
good
replied
the
man
we
start
early
and
you
had
better
be
with
us
betimes
or
you
can
spread
your
carpet
here
as
you
please
i
will
do
the
latter
replied
i
and
be
with
you
by
the
evening
bandah
thought
i
another
place
full
of
thugs
at
least
it
used
to
be
i
shall
see
at
any
rate
and
if
i
find
any
i
may
then
alter
my
route
i
joined
them
in
the
evening
as
i
had
promised
and
we
reached
bandah
in
a
few
days
by
long
marches
here
they
declared
they
would
stay
four
days
so
that
i
had
ample
time
before
me
to
search
the
place
for
thugs
should
any
reside
there
nor
was
i
disappointed
in
my
hope
of
meeting
them
i
was
sauntering
through
the
town
in
the
evening
of
the
day
we
arrived
when
i
met
hoormut
an
old
follower
of
ganesha
he
did
not
at
first
recognise
me
as
may
readily
be
imagined
and
when
i
gave
him
our
token
of
recognition
he
stared
as
though
i
had
been
an
apparition
however
he
was
soon
convinced
of
my
reality
and
i
accompanied
him
to
his
house
the
relation
of
my
adventures
and
mishaps
occupied
a
long
time
and
after
i
had
finished
them
i
naturally
asked
for
an
account
of
my
old
associate
ganesha
what
i
heard
was
gratifying
to
me
hoormut
declared
him
to
be
in
misfortune
abandoned
by
his
followers
and
that
he
was
wandering
with
one
or
two
men
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
saugor
preferring
the
precarious
chance
of
booty
in
the
jungles
between
that
place
and
nagpoor
to
frequenting
the
more
open
and
travelled
country
next
followed
questions
as
to
my
present
plans
and
when
he
heard
i
was
alone
and
travelling
with
merchants
of
course
it
naturally
followed
that
some
plan
should
be
undertaken
for
their
destruction
look
you
meer
sahib
said
he
i
believe
i
can
muster
as
many
as
fifteen
thugs
in
and
near
this
place
i
am
not
suspected
as
yet
but
the
country
is
getting
too
hot
for
us
and
we
must
either
quit
it
or
give
up
thuggee
which
no
man
you
well
know
can
do
after
he
has
eaten
the
goor
the
others
are
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
and
we
had
determined
that
we
would
leave
this
place
for
good
after
the
rains
and
go
wherever
our
fate
might
lead
us
we
soon
afterwards
separated
for
the
time
hoormut
promising
to
collect
the
men
by
the
next
evening
i
joined
him
again
by
the
time
appointed
and
found
the
whole
assembled
i
was
received
with
exultation
for
they
had
wanted
a
leader
in
whom
they
could
confide
and
mine
was
a
name
which
in
spite
of
my
recent
misfortunes
they
could
look
up
to
i
knew
none
of
them
but
they
swore
on
the
pickaxe
to
follow
me
hoormut
vouched
for
their
several
capabilities
and
fidelity
and
i
was
satisfied
our
plan
was
soon
formed
they
were
to
go
by
two
stages
to
a
village
they
knew
there
they
were
to
wait
for
my
arrival
with
the
merchants
beyond
the
village
was
a
favourite
bhil
of
theirs
and
they
would
have
everything
prepared
against
our
coming
up
all
this
being
settled
we
fixed
the
next
morning
it
being
monday
and
a
lucky
day
to
observe
the
omens
and
open
the
expedition
with
due
form
the
omens
were
declared
to
be
satisfactory
and
by
noon
my
new
companions
had
started
with
their
families
for
their
station
on
the
road
chapter
xlvii
we
strangled
the
merchants
at
the
place
we
had
fixed
on
them
and
their
nine
in
all
and
yet
we
were
only
seventeen
thugs
but
we
were
desperate
in
our
route
we
had
travelled
towards
jhalone
and
i
could
no
longer
delay
my
project
of
proceeding
thither
and
making
over
my
concealed
treasure
to
the
good
moola
who
had
charge
of
my
child
hoormut
volunteered
to
accompany
me
and
desiring
the
remainder
of
the
band
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
to
calpee
and
there
to
await
our
arrival
we
pushed
on
to
jhalone
considering
the
risk
we
ran
in
approaching
a
place
where
inevitable
death
awaited
should
i
be
discovered
we
did
well
to
disguise
ourselves
as
gosaeens
we
covered
our
bodies
with
ashes
matted
the
hair
on
our
heads
with
mud
hung
gourds
at
our
waist
and
in
this
mean
and
wretched
disguise
we
entered
the
town
that
spot
where
i
had
passed
so
many
years
of
happiness
where
my
fairest
prospects
had
been
blighted
and
the
resolutions
i
had
formed
of
leading
a
new
life
and
forsaking
thuggee
rendered
alike
impracticable
and
distasteful
to
me
my
emotions
on
entering
the
town
and
more
than
all
on
passing
the
house
where
i
had
resided
were
overpowering
but
i
rallied
my
heart
i
passed
through
the
city
and
my
friend
and
myself
took
up
our
abode
for
the
day
near
a
well
outside
the
gates
which
was
not
far
from
the
spot
where
i
had
buried
my
treasure
we
had
selected
the
best
disguise
possible
for
my
purpose
we
were
visited
during
the
day
by
some
hindoos
who
came
some
out
of
curiosity
and
a
few
to
offer
alms
to
us
my
companion
replied
to
their
inquiries
and
declared
me
to
be
under
a
vow
of
silence
which
satisfied
them
and
they
departed
leaving
us
to
prosecute
our
plans
as
the
evening
approached
i
strolled
towards
the
trees
under
which
was
deposited
the
sum
i
had
hoarded
up
to
serve
me
at
any
time
of
need
it
was
a
deserted
overgrown
by
bushes
and
other
brushwood
and
the
rank
grass
had
sprung
up
from
the
frequent
rain
my
heart
beat
quick
as
i
approached
the
spot
my
hoard
might
have
been
discovered
and
if
it
had
been
removed
my
child
would
be
a
beggar
dependent
upon
the
charity
of
strangers
she
might
even
be
thrust
into
the
street
to
herd
with
the
vile
and
worthless
when
the
care
of
her
became
irksome
or
expensive
to
her
present
protectors
but
anything
thought
i
is
better
than
that
she
should
accompany
me
where
a
life
of
hardship
would
be
her
portion
and
where
she
could
not
escape
the
contamination
which
scenes
of
guilt
and
murder
would
effect
in
a
short
time
and
from
which
alone
as
i
was
i
could
not
protect
her
i
reached
the
tomb
in
which
by
removing
a
stone
i
had
placed
the
vessel
containing
the
money
i
hardly
dared
look
at
the
spot
hardly
dared
attempt
to
remove
the
stone
but
i
did
remove
it
and
o
joy
of
joys
there
was
my
treasure
undisturbed
i
hastily
seized
the
earthen
vessel
and
crawled
with
it
into
the
thickest
of
the
underwood
ere
i
ventured
to
open
and
examine
it
i
had
forgotten
what
it
contained
and
the
contents
surpassed
my
expectations
i
found
thirty
ashruffees
and
four
small
bars
of
gold
a
box
containing
two
strings
of
pearls
of
some
value
and
some
jewels
and
tied
up
in
a
rag
were
some
loose
stones
of
value
one
of
them
a
diamond
of
great
lustre
and
beauty
the
jewels
i
determined
to
keep
as
they
might
be
afterwards
of
use
to
me
not
only
from
their
value
but
to
enable
me
to
assume
the
character
of
a
dealer
in
precious
stones
which
is
always
a
respectable
calling
and
for
which
in
the
jewels
before
me
i
had
ample
stock
for
trade
i
replaced
the
vessel
and
its
precious
contents
which
could
not
have
been
worth
less
than
a
thousand
rupees
and
i
felt
my
heart
lightened
of
a
load
both
at
seeing
my
treasure
safe
and
at
the
assurance
it
gave
me
that
by
means
of
it
my
daughter
would
be
decently
provided
for
i
returned
to
my
companion
who
had
been
anxiously
watching
my
proceedings
and
he
too
rejoiced
at
my
good
fortune
i
did
not
proceed
into
the
town
till
it
was
dusk
the
gates
i
knew
would
be
open
until
long
after
dark
and
i
went
alone
to
avoid
any
chance
of
being
remarked
i
soon
reached
the
house
of
the
moola
when
abandoning
my
character
of
a
gosaeen
i
asked
for
alms
in
a
lusty
voice
in
the
name
of
moula
ali
of
hyderabad
fortunately
the
old
moola
was
sitting
alone
in
his
verandah
i
saw
him
through
the
open
gate
and
advanced
rapidly
shutting
it
behind
me
he
was
engaged
in
reading
his
koran
and
was
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
apparently
absorbed
in
the
book
before
him
so
that
he
did
not
observe
my
approach
nor
was
he
aware
of
my
presence
till
i
had
prostrated
myself
before
him
punah
i
khoda
he
exclaimed
what
is
this
a
gosaeen
thou
must
be
mad
good
friend
or
what
seekest
thou
with
the
old
moola
speak
thou
hast
almost
frightened
me
and
disturbed
my
meditations
on
the
holy
volume
pardon
moolajee
i
cried
you
see
one
before
you
who
has
risked
his
life
to
speak
with
you
and
you
must
listen
to
me
for
a
few
moments
i
know
you
well
though
you
do
not
recognise
me
in
this
disguise
i
know
thee
not
friend
he
said
nevertheless
if
i
can
do
aught
to
serve
thee
speak
yet
it
is
seldom
that
the
hindoo
seeks
the
house
of
the
priest
of
the
moslem
faith
and
i
am
in
astonishment
at
thy
garb
and
address
moola
i
said
i
would
fain
speak
with
thee
in
absolute
secrecy
are
we
secure
from
interruption
here
fear
me
not
i
come
with
good
intent
and
am
not
what
you
think
me
but
one
of
thine
own
faith
and
i
repeated
the
belief

strange
is
this
said
the
old
man
rising
i
doubt
thee
not
no
one
would
do
the
old
moola
harm
and
so
as
thou
requirest
secrecy
i
will
but
fasten
the
outer
gate
and
join
thee
instantly
he
did
so
and
returned
moola
said
i
when
he
was
once
more
seated
and
was
prying
into
my
face
with
a
look
of
mingled
curiosity
and
wonder
moolajee
o
wullee
mahomed
dost
thou
not
recognise
me
thy
voice
is
familiar
to
mine
ears
said
the
old
man
yet
i
remember
not
thy
features
who
art
thou
mine
is
a
name
which
may
hardly
be
pronounced
in
jhalone
i
replied
but
we
are
alone

you
forgotten
ameer
ali
punah
exclaimed
the
moola
sidling
away
from
me
to
the
edge
of
his
carpet
punah
i
khoda
do
i
behold
that
bad
and
reckless
man
bad
i
may
be
moola
said
i
quietly
and
reckless
i
certainly
am
yet
i
wish
thee
no
harm
you
were
kind
to
one
i
loved
you
have
my
child
in
your
house
it
is
of
them
i
would
speak
not
of
myself
tell
me
for
the
sake
of
alla
whether
my
child
is
well
tell
me
whether
she
lives
and
i
will
bless
you
i
gasped
for
breath
while
he
replied
lest
i
should
perchance
have
to
hear
of
further
misfortune
this
is
madness
ameer
ali
said
he
know
you
not
that
your
fate
awaits
you
if
you
are
discovered
here
i
know
i
know
all
said
i
and
i
have
braved
everything
i
have
sought
you
despite
of
danger
for
my
heart
clove
to
my
child
and
i
would
fain
hear
of
her
ah
moola
think
not
of
what
i
was
and
be
merciful
to
me
unhappy
man
he
cried
thy
crimes
brought
with
them
their
own
reward
but
i
will
not
speak
of
the
past
know
then
that
thy
daughter
is
well
but
she
grieves
still
for
thee
and
for
her
mother
whom
alla
in
mercy
removed
from
her
sufferings
before
she
knew
her
degradation
shookr
khoda
i
exclaimed
ah
alla
thou
art
merciful
even
to
me
and
my
child
is
well
and
remembers
me
she
does
meer
sahib
she
often
speaks
of
you
but
we
have
told
her
you
are
dead
and
she
no
longer
thinks
of
you
as
one
whom
she
may
ever
meet
again
and
you
are
right
moola
said
i
you
are
wise
in
having
done
this
may
alla
repay
your
kindness
to
a
deserted
child
for
i
can
not
i
have
sought
you
for
a
purpose
which
you
must
promise
to
agree
to
even
before
i
speak
it
it
is
the
only
request
i
shall
ever
make
for
my
child
and
from
henceforth
you
will
never
see
my
face
again
nor
hear
my
name
speak
said
the
moola
i
promise
nothing
ameer
ali
thou
hast
deceived
thousands
and
the
old
moola
is
no
match
for
thee
in
deceit
briefly
then
said
i
there
was
a
small
treasure
which
i
buried
in
a
field
here
long
ago
i
have
returned
and
found
it
safe
it
is
a
trifle
yet
it
is
of
no
use
to
me
and
i
would
give
it
over
to
you
both
as
a
portion
for
my
daughter
when
she
is
married
and
as
some
provision
for
her
until
that
can
be
effected
the
spoil
of
the
murdered
said
the
old
man
drawing
himself
up
proudly
can
never
enter
the
house
of
the
moola
it
would
bring
a
curse
with
it
and
i
will
have
none
of
it
keep
it
yourself
ameer
ali
and
may
alla
give
you
the
grace
to
use
it
in
regaining
the
honest
reputation
you
have
lost
no
no
cried
i
the
money
was
my
wife
she
had
hoarded
it
up
for
our
child
she
brought
it
with
her
from
the
dukhun
and
it
has
remained
as
she
placed
it
in
the
vessel
i
swear
to
you
that
it
is
honest
money
would
i
curse
my
child
with
the
spoil
of
murders
swear
to
me
on
the
koran
that
it
is
and
i
will
believe
you
ameer
ali
but
not
else
and
he
tendered
me
the
holy
book
i
raised
it
to
my
lips
i
kissed
it
and
touched
my
forehead
and
eyes
with
it
i
swore
to
what
was
false
but
it
was
for
my
child
are
you
satisfied
now
i
asked
now
that
you
have
humbled
me
by
obliging
me
to
swear
i
am
he
replied
your
trust
shall
be
carefully
and
religiously
kept
have
you
the
money
with
you
no
said
i
but
i
will
go
and
return
with
it
instantly
admit
me
alone
i
will
cough
at
your
gate
when
i
arrive
i
hastened
to
the
spot
i
have
before
described
i
hastily
seized
my
treasure
and
returned
to
the
moola
he
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
gate
of
his
house
and
we
entered
it
together
here
is
all
i
have
said
i
pouring
out
the
contents
of
the
vessel
on
the
carpet
it
is
not
much
but
it
is
the
only
portion
of
my
wealth
which
remains
to
me
think
not
of
the
past
meer
sahib
what
happened
was
predestinated
and
was
the
will
of
the
i
have
indeed
no
alternative
but
to
submit
good
moola
but
my
time
is
short
and
night
advances
ere
morning
breaks
i
must
be
far
away
from
this
where
my
associates
expect
me
one
favour
i
would
beg
it
is
to
see
my
child
one
look
will
be
sufficient
for
my
soul
to
dwell
on
in
after
years
for
i
am
assured
that
it
will
be
the
last
you
will
not
deny
me
i
will
not
meer
sahib
she
is
now
at
play
with
a
neighbour
child
in
the
zenana
and
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
show
her
to
you
one
look
must
be
sufficient
for
you
after
that
she
is
mine
and
i
will
be
a
father
to
her
follow
me
i
did
i
followed
him
through
a
to
the
door
of
a
second
which
was
the
entrance
to
his
zenana
i
heard
the
merry
voices
of
the
children
as
they
played
with
light
and
joyful
hearts
and
i
could
distinguish
the
silvery
tones
of
my
precious
child
voice
so
like
those
of
her
mother
which
were
now
silent
for
ever
we
will
not
disturb
them
meer
sahib
said
the
moola
in
a
whisper
as
he
pushed
open
the
door
gently
look
in
so
that
you
may
not
be
seen
you
will
easily
distinguish
your
daughter
yes
she
was
there
my
child
my
beautiful
child
still
delicate
and
fragile
as
she
had
ever
been
but
her
face
had
a
joyous
expression
and
she
was
as
merry
as
those
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
long
long
i
gazed
and
oh
my
heart
yearned
to
rush
in
and
for
the
last
time
to
clasp
her
to
my
bosom
and
bless
her
but
i
restrained
myself
she
would
not
could
not
have
recognized
me
in
the
disguise
i
wore
and
i
should
have
only
needlessly
alarmed
and
terrified
her
yet
i
put
up
a
fervent
prayer
to
alla
for
her
protection
and
happiness
and
i
tore
myself
from
the
spot
dejected
yet
satisfied
that
she
still
lived
and
was
happy
enough
said
i
to
the
moola
when
we
regained
the
outer
apartment
i
now
leave
you
be
kind
to
my
child
and
alla
will
more
than
repay
you
for
aught
of
care
or
anxiety
she
may
cause
you
what
i
have
given
you
will
be
ample
for
a
dowry
to
her
in
marriage
with
any
person
you
may
select
any
one
who
may
be
ignorant
of
her
father
shame
i
will
and
rest
assured
that
wherever
you
are
whatever
your
after
lot
in
life
may
be
you
never
need
give
one
anxious
thought
about
meeran
for
i
again
repeat
it
i
am
now
her
parent
and
she
has
also
found
another
mother
i
believe
you
said
i
and
if
ever
i
am
again
favoured
by
fortune
and
in
a
situation
to
come
to
you
without
shame
to
her
you
shall
take
me
to
her
and
present
a
father
to
his
child
until
then
you
hear
not
of
me
again
i
left
him
i
had
borne
up
against
my
feelings
i
had
struggled
against
and
overcome
them
so
long
as
i
was
with
him
but
as
i
passed
his
threshold
the
fond
love
of
a
parent
would
not
be
stifled
i
was
overcome
by
bitter
grief
and
i
sat
down
and
wept
for
i
felt
that
i
had
seen
my
child
for
the
last
time
and
it
was
even
so
i
have
never
beheld
her
since
sahib
nor
ever
been
able
to
get
a
clue
to
her
fate
may
alla
grant
she
is
happy
and
knows
not
of
mine
but
of
this
more
hereafter
i
wept
yes
i
sat
at
the
threshold
of
what
had
been
my
own
home
and
wept
yet
not
aloud
my
eyes
were
a
fountain
of
tears
and
they
welled
over
their
lids
and
coursed
down
my
rough
visage
and
fell
hot
upon
my
hands
my
memory
was
busy
with
the
past
that
period
of
bliss
when
all
earthly
joy
was
my
portion
and
with
it
wealth
and
fame
all
was
gone
gone
like
the
fleeting
dream
a
mockery
which
gorgeous
or
blissful
as
it
may
be
while
it
possesses
the
sleeping
senses
is
broken
even
the
remembrance
of
it
lost
by
awakening
to
reality
alla
help
me
i
said
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
at
that
moment
i
am
indeed
desolate
and
it
matters
not
what
becomes
of
me
i
have
no
hope
how
long
i
thus
sat
i
know
not
but
arousing
myself
by
a
sudden
thought
of
the
danger
i
was
in
i
rose
up
took
one
long
sad
survey
of
what
was
once
my
own
but
which
was
now
deserted
and
hurrying
away
from
the
spot
i
reached
the
gate
as
it
was
about
to
be
shut
and
soon
afterwards
joined
my
companion
at
length
we
reached
calpee
where
we
found
the
band
and
their
families
and
at
a
council
of
all
assembled
after
many
plans
of
proceeding
had
been
discussed
and
many
plans
proposed
for
our
final
by
the
different
members
i
opened
to
them
one
of
my
own
which
i
had
long
entertained
it
was
to
proceed
to
lukhnow
by
a
boat
which
could
be
easily
hired
and
to
remain
there
as
it
was
a
city
which
promised
an
ample
harvest
to
a
thug
and
from
the
not
character
of
its
government
a
more
likely
one
than
any
other
to
enable
us
to
pursue
our
calling
with
security
the
plan
was
agreed
on
and
the
next
morning
i
betook
myself
to
the
ghaut
to
hold
communication
with
the
manjees
of
the
boats
and
to
strike
a
bargain
for
their
conveyance
of
my
party
all
was
arranged
to
the
satisfaction
of
my
associates
and
at
the
hour
appointed
which
had
been
declared
a
lucky
moment
by
some
astrologer
employed
by
the
boatmen
the
anchor
was
raised
and
a
fair
wind
carried
us
rapidly
over
the
smooth
waters
day
after
day
passed
in
this
manner
and
there
was
a
kind
of
dreamy
pleasure
about
the
voyage
which
was
indescribably
grateful
to
me
here
i
had
no
alarms
no
fatiguing
journeys
no
anxiety
my
mind
became
calm
and
unruffled
and
i
was
once
more
at
peace
at
lukhnow
we
lived
for
some
time
upon
the
proceeds
of
our
last
booty
and
i
established
a
small
traffic
in
precious
stones
upon
those
i
had
brought
with
me
but
it
yielded
small
returns
to
me
and
i
only
delayed
commencing
operations
till
i
could
fix
upon
some
settled
plans
i
had
erred
deeply
in
leaving
my
own
country
if
i
needs
must
have
left
it
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
dukhun
there
i
should
have
succeeded
i
should
have
risen
for
the
dukhun
thugs
required
leaders
and
as
you
may
have
heard
whenever
a
hindostan
jemadar
led
them
they
behaved
well
and
became
the
terror
of
the
country
here
i
was
in
a
place
of
which
i
was
ignorant
and
i
dared
not
venture
to
take
to
the
roads
at
length
i
thought
i
would
attempt
the
same
system
we
had
practised
so
successfully
at
hyderabad
no
sooner
had
the
idea
possessed
me
than
i
longed
to
put
it
into
execution
the
more
so
as
my
associates
received
it
with
ardour
and
seemed
strongly
convinced
of
its
practicability
we
were
unknown
in
that
crowded
and
vicious
city
lived
in
an
obscure
part
and
could
never
be
suspected
in
our
daily
perambulations
through
the
bazars
in
search
of
bunij
and
so
it
turned
out
we
were
in
great
luck
for
two
months
money
flowed
in
upon
us
and
we
had
killed
upwards
of
thirty
persons
mostly
travellers
to
distant
parts
whom
we
decoyed
from
the
serais
and
as
we
succeeded
i
had
more
money
at
my
disposal
and
was
enabled
to
bribe
several
of
the
and
by
allowing
them
to
participate
to
a
large
amount
in
our
gains
i
secured
admission
to
the
serais
and
had
facilities
of
speaking
with
travellers
which
i
should
never
have
enjoyed
had
i
neglected
to
secure
their
goodwill
but
fortune
was
against
me
despite
of
this
cheering
commencement
and
we
did
not
long
enjoy
our
easy
and
profitable
career
we
had
one
day
taken
out
of
the
city
a
party
of
seven
travellers
we
being
sixteen
thugs
in
number
i
well
remember
it
was
a
friday
an
unlucky
day
at
best
among
the
thugs
was
an
old
man
one
of
the
old
murnae
stock
a
capital
bhuttote
who
had
joined
us
a
short
time
before
he
had
known
my
father
and
me
when
a
child
and
had
recognized
me
in
a
street
in
lukhnow
which
led
to
his
joining
us
we
had
taken
the
travellers
to
a
favourite
bhil
of
ours
about
four
coss
distant
and
were
in
the
act
of
strangling
them
some
even
lay
dead
on
the
ground
and
the
rest
were
in
their
last
agonies
when
by
the
merest
chance
a
body
of
horse
which
were
on
their
way
from
the
city
to
a
distant
pergunnah
came
upon
us
we
had
grown
too
confident
from
our
frequent
successes
it
was
still
far
from
morning
and
we
had
neglected
to
place
scouts
the
horse
came
upon
us
unheard
and
unseen
and
as
i
have
told
you
caught
us
in
the
very
act
nine
of
us
were
seized
after
a
faint
resistance
the
rest
fortunate
men
made
their
escape
our
hands
were
bound
behind
us
and
we
were
dragged
into
the
city
objects
of
wonder
and
terror
to
the
inhabitants
the
bodies
were
brought
in
after
us
and
two
of
the
travellers
who
had
been
only
half
strangled
and
were
revived
by
the
horsemen
gave
so
clear
an
account
of
our
whole
proceedings
how
we
had
inveigled
them
and
accompanied
them
on
their
march
till
we
attacked
them
unawares
that
no
doubt
remained
of
our
guilt
and
after
our
brief
trial
had
been
concluded
before
the
kazee
we
were
cast
into
prison
to
await
our
fate
the
old
thug
and
myself
had
been
bound
together
and
we
were
in
this
state
thrust
into
one
of
the
narrow
cells
of
the
jail
there
we
were
told
we
should
remain
till
the
pleasure
of
the
king
was
known
regarding
us
chapter
xlviii
again
i
was
in
prison
and
although
not
in
such
wretched
plight
as
i
had
been
at
jhalone
for
the
cell
was
roomy
and
tolerably
clean
yet
still
it
was
a
prison
confinement
to
my
limbs
and
to
my
spirit
a
conviction
which
threatened
my
life
hung
over
me
and
as
i
saw
no
prospect
of
escape
i
was
resigned
to
die
and
to
meet
my
fate
like
a
man
and
a
thug
who
had
been
familiar
with
death
from
his
childhood
we
sat
in
silence
and
my
wretched
companion
old
as
he
was
clung
to
the
idea
of
life
with
a
fondness
that
i
felt
not
he
had
no
ties
on
earth
to
bind
him
to
it
he
had
never
had
any
yet
he
longed
to
live
i
possessed
them
they
were
all
broken
and
life
had
no
charms
for
me
i
could
not
say
that
i
wished
for
death
but
i
was
indifferent
to
my
fate
a
week
passed
thus
a
long
interminable
week
in
vain
was
it
that
i
implored
my
jailors
to
relieve
me
from
suspense
to
tell
me
whether
i
was
to
live
or
die
either
they
knew
not
or
their
hearts
were
hardened
towards
me
they
would
not
tell
me
but
after
the
expiration
of
this
period
we
were
not
long
ignorant
of
our
sentence
we
were
informed
that
seven
of
our
companions
had
been
hanged
as
they
had
been
detected
in
the
act
of
strangling
the
travellers
but
there
was
no
evidence
against
us
so
conclusive
the
merchants
who
had
escaped
the
fate
of
their
associates
could
not
swear
that
we
had
murdered
any
of
those
who
had
perished
and
the
horsemen
who
had
captured
us
knew
no
more
than
that
we
were
of
the
party
if
this
had
been
all
we
should
probably
have
been
released
but
one
of
the
miserable
men
who
had
been
executed
in
a
vain
attempt
to
preserve
his
life
confessed
his
crimes
and
by
this
last
stroke
of
ill
fortune
we
were
convicted
and
the
decree
went
forth
that
we
were
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
despair
seized
on
my
faculties
at
the
announcement
of
this
hard
sentence
death
in
its
most
horrible
shape
would
have
been
courted
joyfully
by
me
in
preference
to
it
to
linger
out
years
and
years
in
that
wretched
hole
never
to
be
free
again
i
could
not
believe
it
i
tried
to
shut
out
the
dreadful
reality
from
my
mind
but
in
vain
i
implored
that
they
would
lead
me
to
instant
execution
that
i
might
be
impaled
or
blown
away
from
a
gun
or
hanged
anything
rather
than
have
my
miserable
existence
protracted
in
the
solitude
and
suffering
of
a
prison
but
my
entreaties
were
laughed
at
or
scorned
i
was
loaded
with
a
heavy
chain
which
confined
my
legs
my
companion
the
same
and
we
were
left
to
our
fate
still
my
restless
spirit
held
out
to
me
hopes
of
escape
hopes
that
only
mocked
me
for
every
plan
i
formed
became
utterly
impracticable
and
this
only
increased
my
misery
one
day
i
bethought
me
of
the
money
i
had
collected
before
i
was
seized
it
was
hidden
and
it
was
not
improbable
that
my
hoard
had
remained
undiscovered
with
this
i
fondly
hoped
i
should
be
enabled
to
bribe
one
of
my
jailors
and
the
idea
comforted
me
for
many
days
while
i
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
put
it
into
execution
there
was
one
among
the
guards
of
the
prison
a
young
man
who
was
always
kinder
in
his
deportment
to
us
than
any
of
the
others
the
food
he
brought
us
was
better
and
the
water
always
pure
and
in
a
clean
vessel
he
used
to
cheer
us
too
sometimes
with
the
hope
that
our
imprisonment
would
not
last
so
long
as
had
been
decreed
and
he
instanced
the
cases
of
several
criminals
who
had
been
sentenced
like
us
but
who
had
been
released
when
the
memory
of
their
crimes
had
ceased
to
occupy
the
minds
of
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
prison
he
had
our
clothes
washed
for
us
and
did
a
thousand
kind
acts
trifles
perhaps
but
still
more
than
we
experienced
from
any
other
of
his
companions
it
was
with
him
therefore
that
i
proposed
to
my
to
try
our
and
cherished
scheme
of
deliverance
the
next
time
it
was
his
turn
to
attend
us
i
begged
he
would
come
to
the
cell
at
night
or
in
the
evening
when
he
would
be
secure
from
observation
for
that
i
had
something
particular
to
communicate
to
him
he
came
in
the
evening
of
that
day
and
seated
himself
muffled
in
a
blanket
close
to
the
bars
of
our
cell
you
have
something
to
say
i
think
said
he
in
a
low
tone
and
i
have
done
your
bidding
i
am
here
i
have
good
meer
sahib
said
i
for
he
was
also
a
syud
listen
for
what
i
would
communicate
to
you
will
be
for
your
benefit
if
you
will
enter
into
my
plans
say
on
replied
the
youth
you
may
command
my
utmost
exertions
to
be
brief
then
i
continued
you
must
endeavour
to
effect
our
escape
it
is
impossible
he
said
not
so
cried
i
nothing
is
impossible
to
willing
hands
and
stout
hearts
you
can
manage
everything
if
you
will
but
listen
to
me
when
we
were
apprehended
we
had
saved
a
round
sum
of
money
which
is
concealed
in
a
spot
i
can
tell
you
of
if
you
will
be
faithful
to
us
half
of
it
shall
be
yours
if
you
will
only
aid
us
how
much
is
it
he
asked
upwards
of
five
hundred
rupees
said
i
it
was
securely
hidden
and
no
one
can
have
discovered
it
i
repeat
half
of
it
shall
be
yours
if
you
will
assist
us
how
can
i
cried
he
in
a
tone
of
perplexity
how
is
it
possible
that
you
can
pass
these
doors
and
walls
even
were
you
as
free
as
i
am
at
this
moment
leave
that
to
me
said
i
do
you
accept
the
offer
i
will
consider
of
the
matter
and
will
be
here
at
this
time
to
give
you
a
final
answer
may
alla
send
you
kind
thoughts
to
the
distressed
we
shall
look
for
your
decision
with
impatience
the
next
evening
he
came
at
the
same
time
and
seated
himself
as
before
what
would
you
have
me
do
meer
sahib
he
asked
i
am
ready
to
obey
your
commands
if
they
are
practicable
first
however
i
must
be
secure
of
the
money
you
have
mentioned
i
must
receive
it
before
i
peril
my
situation
and
more
than
that
my
life
in
your
behalf
listen
then
meer
sahib
said
i
i
trust
you
you
are
a
syud
and
i
also
am
one
you
dare
not
deceive
me
and
incur
the
wrath
of
alla
i
will
not
by
the
prophet
whose
descendant
i
am
said
he
were
the
koran
in
my
hands
this
moment
i
would
swear
upon
it
no
no
said
i
do
not
swear
the
word
of
an
honest
man
is
far
more
binding
than
an
oath
i
believe
that
you
are
true
and
therefore
it
is
that
i
trust
you
first
then
as
regards
the
money
do
you
remember
two
old
tombs
one
of
them
much
broken
which
stand
near
the
brink
over
the
the
north
side
of
the
city
about
a
from
the
wall
i
do
perfectly
then
i
continued
in
that
broken
one
is
an
earthen
vessel
containing
the
money
the
vault
where
of
old
the
body
of
the
person
over
whom
the
tomb
was
erected
was
deposited
can
be
opened
by
removing
four
stones
which
are
loose
from
the
eastern
side
of
it
they
are
neither
large
nor
heavy
and
you
can
manage
the
matter
alone
in
the
cavity
you
will
find
the
vessel
and
the
money
is
in
it
i
shall
require
half
for
my
expenses
now
all
i
ask
you
for
the
present
to
do
in
return
is
to
procure
us
two
small
and
sharp
files
and
some
ghee
and
when
we
have
cut
through
our
chains
and
one
of
these
bars
i
will
tell
you
how
you
can
aid
us
further
i
will
perform
all
you
wish
said
the
youth
and
inshalla
you
shall
have
the
files
night
by
this
time
if
i
find
that
your
statement
about
the
money
is
true
he
then
left
us
and
we
anxiously
and
impatiently
awaited
his
coming
the
next
day
nor
did
he
disappoint
us
i
have
come
as
you
see
meer
sahib
he
said
and
behold
here
are
the
files
for
you
they
are
english
and
new
and
sharp
here
too
is
the
ghee
i
have
fulfilled
my
promise
and
the
money
i
asked
without
it
you
would
not
have
seen
me
i
can
tell
you
meer
sahib
i
have
got
it
the
amount
is
five
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
and
you
shall
be
welcome
to
your
share
when
you
have
got
out
of
this
hole
and
how
do
you
intend
to
manage
this
part
of
your
scheme
are
the
gates
of
the
prison
shut
at
night
i
asked
no
he
replied
that
is
the
gate
is
shut
but
the
wicket
is
always
open
and
how
many
men
guard
it
only
one
meer
sahib
the
rest
sleep
soundly
after
midnight
it
is
well
said
i
we
can
but
perish
in
the
attempt
and
i
for
one
would
gladly
die
rather
than
linger
out
a
wretched
existence
here
and
i
also
said
my
companion
i
fear
i
can
not
assist
you
said
the
man
yet
stay
suppose
you
were
to
attempt
your
escape
when
i
am
on
guard
i
shall
have
the
last
watch
night
may
the
blessing
of
alla
rest
on
you
said
i
you
have
anticipated
my
thoughts
we
will
attempt
it
then
and
may
the
prophet
aid
us
all
night
we
will
work
at
our
irons
and
one
of
these
bars
and
night
we
shall
be
free
go
kind
friend
you
do
but
risk
detection
in
being
seen
here
he
left
us
and
we
set
to
work
with
a
good
will
to
cut
the
irons
on
our
legs
and
the
bar
all
night
we
worked
and
the
morning
light
saw
the
iron
bar
nearly
cut
through
at
the
top
and
bottom
to
cut
it
at
the
top
one
of
us
sat
down
by
turns
while
the
other
standing
on
his
shoulders
filed
till
his
arm
was
tired
despite
of
the
ghee
however
the
files
made
a
creaking
noise
we
tried
to
prevent
this
by
using
them
slowly
but
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
this
was
at
times
forgotten
for
we
worked
hard
for
our
liberty
the
morning
broke
and
we
rested
from
our
labour
one
strong
shake
would
have
separated
the
bar
and
our
irons
were
so
nearly
cut
through
at
the
ancles
and
the
waist
that
a
slight
wrench
would
have
divided
them
our
friend
we
knew
was
faithful
for
he
had
proved
himself
so
and
we
enjoyed
a
silent
anticipation
of
our
eventual
triumph
this
time
i
exclaimed
we
shall
be
free
far
from
lukhnow
and
the
world
again
before
us
wherein
to
choose
a
residence
my
companion
was
as
full
of
hope
as
i
was
and
we
passed
most
of
the
morning
in
debating
whither
we
should
go
and
calling
to
mind
the
names
of
our
former
associates
who
would
welcome
us
and
join
us
in
seeking
new
adventures
it
was
about
noon
i
think
that
a
party
of
the
soldiers
of
the
prison
headed
by
the
darogha
approached
our
cell
my
heart
sunk
within
me
as
i
saw
them
coming
and
the
haste
with
which
they
advanced
towards
us
increased
my
alarm
and
apprehension
we
are
lost
said
i
to
my
companion
they
have
discovered
our
plans
he
did
not
reply
but
despair
was
written
on
his
countenance
the
darogha
applied
his
key
to
the
lock
it
was
opened
and
the
whole
party
rushed
in
and
seized
us
what
new
tyranny
is
this
i
exclaimed
what
new
crime
have
we
committed
that
we
are
again
to
be
look
to
their
irons
cried
the
darogha
to
his
men
you
have
been
busy
it
seems
said
he
to
us
when
they
found
them
in
the
state
i
have
described
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
when
you
next
file
your
irons
either
use
more
ghee
or
make
less
noise
but
you
will
hardly
have
another
opportunity
i
think
search
them
well
continued
he
to
the
men
see
where
these
instruments
are
which
they
have
used
so
cleverly
they
stripped
us
stark
naked
and
the
files
were
found
in
the
bands
of
our
trowsers
through
which
the
string
that
ties
them
runs
the
darogha
examined
them
carefully
these
are
new
meer
sahib
and
english
inshalla
we
will
find
out
who
supplied
you
with
them
the
fellow
who
has
done
this
assuredly
has
eaten
dirt
we
brought
them
here
with
us
said
i
doggedly
ye
were
sons
of
asses
that
ye
did
not
search
us
when
we
entered
your
den
of
tyranny
we
may
be
sons
of
asses
he
replied
grinning
but
we
are
not
such
owls
as
to
believe
you
o
wise
and
cunning
syud
thug
as
you
are
we
are
not
going
to
eat
dirt
at
your
hands
some
friend
you
have
had
among
my
men
one
is
suspected
and
if
these
files
can
help
us
to
trace
him
and
it
is
probable
enough
he
had
better
say
the
kulma
for
his
head
and
shoulders
will
not
long
remain
together
but
come
said
he
to
his
men
your
work
is
only
half
done
examine
every
foot
of
these
bars
for
my
worthy
friends
here
rely
upon
it
have
not
half
done
their
business
they
obeyed
him
and
as
you
may
suppose
soon
found
the
bar
which
had
been
cut
enough
said
the
darogha
you
were
a
fool
o
meer
sahib
for
this
wild
attempt
had
you
been
content
to
bear
your
deserved
imprisonment
mercy
might
in
time
have
been
shown
to
you
but
now
give
up
all
hope
you
have
forfeited
that
mercy
by
your
own
imprudence
and
you
will
long
live
to
repent
it
bring
them
along
said
he
to
his
men
we
must
put
them
into
narrower
and
safer
lodgings
ya
alla
sahib
what
a
place
they
led
us
to
a
narrow
passage
between
two
high
walls
which
but
just
admitted
of
a
man
passing
along
it
contained
about
down
two
cells
more
like
the
dens
of
wild
beasts
than
aught
else
they
were
more
strongly
grated
than
the
last
we
had
been
in
and
were
not
half
the
size
far
heavier
irons
than
those
we
had
last
worn
were
fastened
on
our
legs
by
a
blacksmith
and
we
were
thrust
into
our
horrible
abodes
now
said
the
darogha
get
out
if
you
can
meer
sahib
if
walls
and
iron
bars
can
hold
you
you
are
pretty
safe
here
i
think
they
left
us
and
once
more
we
were
cast
into
the
abyss
of
despair
nor
was
there
one
ray
of
hope
left
to
cheer
our
gloomy
and
wretched
thoughts
here
am
i
to
live
here
am
i
to
die
thought
i
as
i
surveyed
the
narrow
chamber
i
who
have
roamed
for
years
over
the
world
i
who
have
never
known
restraint
alla
alla
what
have
i
done
that
this
should
be
o
bhowanee
hast
thou
so
utterly
forsaken
ameer
ali
i
cast
myself
down
on
the
rough
floor
and
groaned
in
agony
i
could
not
weep
tears
were
denied
me
they
would
have
soothed
my
overburthened
soul
a
cup
of
misery
was
before
me
and
i
was
to
drain
it
to
the
dregs
hope
had
fled
and
despair
had
seized
and
benumbed
every
faculty
of
my
mind
months
rolled
on
though
only
a
strong
grating
of
iron
bars
divided
me
from
my
old
companion
we
seldom
spoke
to
each
other
at
most
it
was
a
word
a
passing
remark
hazarded
by
the
one
and
scarcely
heeded
by
the
other
so
absorbed
were
we
in
our
misery
i
ate
and
drank
mechanically
i
had
no
craving
for
food
and
what
they
gave
us
to
eat
was
of
the
coarsest
kind
the
filth
which
accumulated
in
our
cells
was
removed
only
once
a
week
and
it
bred
vermin
which
sorely
tormented
us
oh
that
i
could
die
i
cried
a
thousand
times
a
day
alas
my
prayer
was
not
granted
the
second
year
of
our
captivity
passed
the
same
unvarying
rotation
of
misery
no
change
no
amelioration
of
our
condition
we
existed
but
no
more
the
energies
of
life
were
dead
within
us
i
used
to
think
were
i
ever
released
that
i
could
not
bear
the
rude
bustle
of
the
world
that
i
should
even
prefer
my
captivity
to
its
anxieties
and
cares
it
was
a
foolish
thought
for
i
often
yearned
for
freedom
and
occupied
my
mind
with
vain
thoughts
and
plans
for
future
action
should
any
lucky
chance
give
me
my
liberty
but
no
ray
of
hope
broke
in
upon
the
misery
of
my
dungeon
i
mean
not
to
say
that
my
companion
the
old
thug
and
i
never
conversed
we
did
so
now
and
then
we
recounted
our
exploits
again
and
again
and
by
thus
recalling
mine
to
my
memory
from
the
beginning
of
my
career
i
stored
up
in
my
mind
the
adventures
and
vicissitudes
i
have
related
to
you
one
day
we
had
been
talking
of
my
father
and
his
parting
words
to
me
i
am
not
your
father
flashed
across
my
thoughts
i
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
the
old
thug
and
earnestly
requested
him
to
tell
me
what
he
knew
of
ismail
and
of
my
early
state
what
he
asked
so
you
know
not
of
it
meer
sahib
surely
ismail
must
have
told
you
all
and
yet
continued
he
after
a
pause
he
would
not
have
done
it
he
dared
not
what
can
you
mean
cried
i
by
saying
he
dared
not
was
i
his
son
or
did
he
say
truly
when
he
declared
i
was
not
he
spoke
the
truth
meer
sahib
i
know
your
origin
and
it
is
just
possible
there
may
be
one
or
two
others
who
do
also
and
who
are
still
living
one
of
these
is
ganesha
ganesha
i
exclaimed
by
alla
my
soul
has
ever
told
me
that
he
knew
something
of
me
i
have
striven
in
vain
to
bring
any
scene
in
which
he
was
concerned
with
me
to
my
recollection
and
always
failed
by
your
soul
tell
me
who
and
what
i
was
is
a
long
tale
ameer
ali
said
the
old
man
but
i
will
endeavour
to
remember
all
i
can
of
it
it
is
one
too
which
were
you
not
what
you
are
would
horrify
you
my
parents
were
murdered
then
said
i
my
heart
sinking
within
me
i
have
sometimes
thought
so
but
my
conjectures
were
vague
and
unsatisfactory
you
have
guessed
truly
meer
sahib
but
listen
my
memory
is
still
fresh
and
you
shall
know
all
ismail
your
father
as
he
called
himself
to
you
became
a
thug
under
hoosein
jemadar
whom
no
doubt
you
remember
i
well
recollect
the
day
he
joined
us
at
a
village
not
very
far
from
delhi
i
was
then
a
youth
and
belonged
to
the
band
of
which
hoosein
was
one
of
the
best
bhuttotes
i
know
ismail
history
said
i
he
related
it
to
me
then
i
need
not
repeat
it
he
continued
in
time
ismail
by
his
bravery
and
wisdom
rose
far
above
hoosein
and
became
the
jemadar
of
a
band
of
thirty
thugs
it
is
of
this
time
i
would
speak
we
were
one
day
at
a
village
called
ekléra
in
malwa
encamped
outside
the
place
in
a
grove
of
trees
near
a
well
we
had
been
unlucky
for
some
time
before
as
it
was
the
season
of
the
rains
when
but
few
travellers
are
abroad
and
we
were
eagerly
looking
for
bunij
ismail
and
ganesha
had
been
into
the
bazar
and
returned
with
the
joyful
news
that
a
party
was
about
to
set
off
towards
indoor
and
that
we
were
to
precede
them
by
a
march
and
halt
whenever
we
thought
them
secure
to
us
i
and
another
thug
were
directed
to
watch
their
movements
while
the
main
body
went
on
the
information
was
correct
and
we
dogged
them
till
the
third
or
fourth
march
when
at
a
village
whose
name
i
forget
we
found
the
band
halted
and
rejoined
it
the
party
consisted
of
a
respectable
man
and
his
wife
and
child
an
old
woman
and
some
young
men
of
the
village
who
accompanied
them
the
man
rode
a
good
horse
and
his
wife
travelled
in
a
palankeen
they
were
your
parents
meer
sahib
go
on
said
i
in
a
hoarse
voice
my
memory
seems
to
follow
your
narration
o
sahib
i
was
fearfully
interested
and
excited
well
continued
he
not
long
after
they
had
arrived
ismail
and
ganesha
went
into
the
bazar
dressed
in
their
best
clothes
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
your
father
and
as
ismail
told
us
afterwards
this
was
effected
through
you
he
saw
you
playing
in
the
streets
gave
you
some
sweetmeats
and
afterwards
rescued
you
from
the
violence
of
some
of
the
village
boys
who
would
have
robbed
you
of
them
this
led
to
his
speaking
with
your
mother
and
eventually
to
his
becoming
acquainted
with
your
father
the
end
of
all
was
that
they
agreed
to
accompany
us
and
dismissed
the
young
men
by
whom
they
had
been
previously
attended
does
your
memory
aid
you
now
meer
sahib
or
shall
i
finish
the
relation
it
does
said
i
most
vividly
as
you
proceed
but
go
on
without
your
assistance
i
lose
the
thread
of
my
sad
history
he
resumed
ismail
in
those
days
always
rode
a
good
horse
as
also
did
ganesha
he
grew
fond
of
you
and
you
of
him
and
he
used
to
take
you
up
before
him
and
carry
you
most
part
of
the
march
or
till
you
became
fatigued
this
went
on
for
some
days
but
we
were
approaching
indoor
and
it
was
necessary
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
close
besides
our
cupidity
was
strongly
excited
by
the
accounts
we
heard
from
ismail
of
your
wealth
as
he
had
told
him
that
he
carried
a
large
sum
of
ready
money
with
him
at
last
the
bhil
was
determined
i
could
show
it
you
now
it
was
close
to
a
river
and
before
the
party
had
crossed
the
jhirnee
was
given
we
strangled
them
all
ganesha
killed
your
mother
the
old
woman
was
allotted
to
me
ismail
had
his
share
also
and
i
believe
it
was
your
father
you
had
been
riding
upon
ismail
horse
all
the
morning
at
least
after
the
rain
had
ceased
and
when
the
jhirnee
was
given
you
were
half
across
the
river
i
saw
you
fall
and
as
you
did
not
move
afterwards
i
thought
you
were
killed
you
moved
however
and
ganesha
ran
towards
you
he
threw
the
roomal
about
your
neck
and
was
in
the
act
of
strangling
you
when
ismail
who
had
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
on
seeing
ganesha
action
arrived
just
in
time
to
prevent
his
deadly
purpose
they
had
a
serious
quarrel
about
you
and
even
drew
their
swords
but
ismail
prevailed
and
led
you
to
where
the
bodies
were
lying
and
being
stripped
by
the
lughaees
you
became
frantic
when
you
saw
your
mother
you
clung
to
her
body
and
could
hardly
be
torn
from
it
you
raved
and
cursed
us
all
but
terror
overcame
you
at
last
and
perhaps
pain
also
for
you
fainted
ismail
when
the
bodies
had
been
disposed
of
and
the
plunder
collected
mounted
his
horse
and
took
you
up
before
him
and
turning
off
the
road
we
travelled
in
another
direction
how
you
ever
bore
that
journey
i
know
not
you
were
a
thin
and
delicate
child
and
we
all
said
you
would
die
but
you
bore
it
well
and
when
we
reached
a
place
in
the
jungle
i
was
sent
to
a
village
for
milk
and
you
drank
some
here
again
ismail
and
ganesha
had
a
second
quarrel
about
you
ganesha
said
you
were
too
old
to
adopt
that
you
would
remember
all
that
had
happened
and
that
he
would
strangle
you
and
the
abuse
that
you
poured
upon
him
made
him
still
more
savage
again
they
drew
their
swords
and
would
have
fought
about
you
but
we
prevented
them
you
were
taken
away
by
me
to
a
distance
i
rubbed
your
swollen
neck
and
ismail
gave
you
a
strong
dose
of
opium
which
put
you
to
sleep
and
we
again
resumed
our
flight
ganesha
and
he
were
never
cordial
friends
after
that
day
they
never
acted
in
concert
again
until
as
i
heard
in
your
last
expedition
and
though
they
preserved
an
outward
show
of
civility
to
each
other
their
hate
was
as
strong
as
ever
ismail
took
you
to
his
home
he
was
married
but
had
no
children
and
as
you
grew
up
and
improved
under
his
kind
and
fatherly
treatment
he
became
proud
of
you
and
used
often
to
say
to
us
that
he
regretted
your
father
had
left
your
sister
behind
when
he
undertook
his
fatal
journey
to
indoor
my
sister
cried
i
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
yes
meer
sahib
your
sister
i
for
one
heard
your
father
say
that
he
left
her
behind
as
she
was
too
young
to
be
moved
you
might
get
news
of
her
at
ekléra
if
you
ever
get
out
of
this
cursed
hole
but
he
now
spoke
to
one
bereft
of
sense
of
any
feeling
save
that
of
choking
withering
blighting
agony
why
did
not
my
heartstrings
crack
in
that
moment
why
did
i
live
to
drag
a
load
of
remorse
with
me
to
my
grave
yet
it
has
even
been
so
i
live
and
i
have
borne
my
misery
as
best
i
could
to
most
i
appear
calm
and
cheerful
but
the
wound
rankles
in
my
heart
and
could
you
but
know
my
sufferings
sahib
you
would
perhaps
pity
me
not
in
the
daytime
is
my
mind
disturbed
by
the
thoughts
of
the
past
it
is
at
night
when
all
is
still
around
me
and
sleep
falls
not
upon
my
weary
eyelids
that
i
see
again
before
me
the
form
of
my
unfortunate
sister
again
i
fancy
my
hands
busy
with
her
beautiful
neck
and
the
vile
piece
of
coin
for
which
i
killed
her
seems
again
in
my
grasp
as
i
tore
it
from
her
warm
bosom
sahib
there
is
no
respite
from
these
hideous
thoughts
if
i
eat
opium
which
i
do
in
large
quantities
to
produce
a
temporary
oblivion
i
behold
the
same
scene
in
the
dreams
which
it
causes
and
it
is
distorted
and
exaggerated
by
the
effects
of
the
drug
nay
this
is
worse
to
bear
than
the
simple
reality
to
which
i
sometimes
become
accustomed
until
one
vision
more
vivid
that
its
predecessors
again
plunges
me
into
despair
of
its
ever
quitting
me
sahib
after
that
fatal
relation
i
know
not
what
i
did
for
many
days
i
believe
i
raved
and
they
thought
me
mad
but
my
mind
was
strong
and
not
to
be
overthrown
i
recovered
though
slowly
and
again
and
again
i
retraced
in
my
memory
the
whole
of
my
life
till
that
miserable
day
on
which
i
murdered
my
sister
it
could
have
been
no
other
i
tried
in
vain
to
cheat
myself
into
the
belief
that
it
was
another
but
no
effort
that
i
made
could
shake
the
conviction
that
it
was
she
my
unaccountable
recollection
of
ekléra
the
relation
of
my
death
by
the
old
man
there
his
almost
recognition
of
me
and
more
than
all
the
old
and
worthless
coin
for
which
i
destroyed
her
and
which
i
now
remembered
perfectly
all
were
undeniable
proofs
of
my
crime
and
conviction
though
i
tried
to
shut
it
out
entered
into
my
soul
and
abode
there
alla
help
me
i
was
a
wretched
being
my
hair
turned
gray
my
form
and
strength
wasted
and
any
one
who
had
seen
me
before
i
listened
to
the
old
thug
tale
would
not
have
recognized
me
two
months
afterwards
a
kind
of
burning
fever
possessed
me
my
blood
felt
hot
as
it
coursed
through
my
veins
and
the
night
oh
how
i
dreaded
it
i
never
slept
except
by
day
when
exhausted
nature
at
length
claimed
some
respite
night
after
night
for
months
and
months
i
either
rolled
to
and
fro
on
my
miserable
pallet
or
sat
up
and
rocked
myself
groaning
the
while
in
remorse
and
anguish
no
other
act
of
my
life
rose
up
in
judgment
against
me
none
but
that
one
i
tried
even
to
think
on
others
but
they
passed
from
my
mind
as
quickly
as
they
entered
it
and
my
sister
was
ever
before
me
you
know
the
worst
sahib
think
of
me
as
you
will
i
deserve
it
i
can
not
justify
the
deed
to
myself
much
less
to
you
and
the
only
consolation
i
have
that
it
was
the
work
of
fate
of
unerring
destiny
is
but
a
weak
one
that
gives
way
before
the
conviction
of
my
own
guilt
i
must
bear
my
curse
i
must
wither
under
it
i
pray
for
death
and
as
often
too
pray
that
i
may
live
and
that
my
measure
of
punishment
may
be
allotted
to
me
here
that
my
soul
may
not
burn
in
jehanum
i
may
now
as
well
bring
my
history
to
a
close
to
the
time
when
by
accepting
your
boon
of
life
i
became
dead
to
the
world
my
old
companion
died
in
the
fourth
year
of
our
captivity
i
would
fain
have
had
him
deny
the
tale
he
told
me
of
my
father
destruction
but
he
would
not
he
was
dying
when
i
urged
him
to
do
so
and
again
declared
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
what
he
had
related
was
true
in
every
particular
and
again
he
referred
me
to
ganesha
my
murderer
for
confirmation
of
the
whole
he
died
and
i
was
left
to
solitude
to
utter
solitude
which
was
only
broken
by
the
daily
visit
of
my
jailor
who
brought
me
food
and
attended
me
during
a
short
walk
up
and
down
the
passage
this
favour
alone
had
i
extorted
after
those
years
of
misery
and
it
was
grateful
to
me
to
stretch
my
cramped
limbs
and
again
to
feel
the
pure
air
of
heaven
breathe
over
my
wasted
features
the
seventh
year
had
half
passed
the
darogha
of
the
jail
was
dead
or
had
been
removed
another
supplied
his
place
and
some
amelioration
of
my
condition
ensued
i
was
removed
from
the
lonely
cell
into
one
near
where
i
had
been
first
confined
it
was
more
spacious
and
airy
and
people
passed
to
and
fro
before
it
i
used
to
watch
their
motions
with
interest
and
this
in
some
degree
diverted
my
mind
from
brooding
over
the
past
in
the
twelfth
year
of
my
imprisonment
the
old
king
died
and
his
successor
the
late
monarch
ascended
the
musnud
many
a
heart
beat
quickly
and
with
renewed
hope
hope
that
had
almost
died
within
the
hearts
of
those
wretches
who
were
immured
within
the
walls
and
of
mine
among
the
rest
we
had
heard
that
it
was
customary
to
release
all
who
had
been
sentenced
to
perpetual
imprisonment
and
you
can
hardly
imagine
sahib
the
intense
anxiety
with
which
i
looked
for
the
time
when
the
mandate
should
be
issued
for
our
release
or
when
i
should
no
longer
dare
to
hope
it
came
at
last
after
some
days
of
weary
expectation
the
order
reached
the
darogha
and
it
was
quickly
conveyed
to
me
i
was
brought
forth
the
chains
were
knocked
off
my
legs
and
i
was
free
five
rupees
were
given
to
me
and
a
suit
of
coarse
clothes
in
place
of
those
which
hung
in
rags
about
my
person
after
more
than
twelve
weary
years
i
issued
from
those
prison
walls
and
was
again
thrown
upon
the
world
to
seek
my
fortune
beware
meer
sahib
said
the
darogha
as
he
presented
me
with
the
money
beware
of
following
your
old
profession
you
are
old
your
blood
no
longer
flows
as
it
used
and
what
you
have
been
you
should
forget
go
follow
some
peaceful
calling
and
fortune
may
yet
smile
upon
you
i
thanked
him
and
departed
i
roamed
through
the
city
till
nightfall
and
after
satisfying
my
hunger
at
the
shop
of
a
bhutteara
i
begged
from
him
shelter
for
the
night
it
was
readily
granted
and
i
lay
down
and
enjoyed
the
first
quiet
and
refreshing
sleep
i
had
known
for
years
i
arose
with
the
dawn
and
went
forth
whither
i
cared
not
all
places
in
the
wide
world
seemed
alike
to
me
i
knew
no
one
i
could
find
no
one
who
knew
me
in
that
large
city
and
i
felt
the
desolation
of
my
condition
press
heavily
upon
me
what
to
do
or
whither
to
go
i
knew
not
but
a
faint
hope
that
i
might
discover
some
of
my
old
associates
if
i
could
reach
bundelkhund
impelled
me
to
travel
thither
a
change
in
my
dress
was
soon
effected
from
a
kalundur
fakeer
i
purchased
a
high
felt
hat
and
a
chequered
garment
for
a
small
sum
and
thus
equipped
with
a
staff
in
my
hand
i
left
the
city
by
the
north
gate
and
travelled
onwards
it
was
as
i
thought
i
was
never
without
a
meal
though
it
might
be
of
the
coarsest
food
and
when
i
reached
jhalone
my
little
stock
of
money
was
nearly
as
large
as
when
i
had
left
lukhnow
i
went
direct
to
the
house
of
the
moola
for
my
thoughts
were
ever
with
my
daughter
and
my
soul
yearned
to
know
her
fate
alas
i
was
disappointed
his
house
was
inhabited
by
another
whom
i
knew
not
and
all
he
could
tell
me
was
that
the
old
man
had
gone
to
delhi
he
believed
some
years
before
and
that
he
had
not
heard
any
tidings
of
him
since
i
asked
after
his
daughters
but
the
man
knew
nothing
of
them
except
that
one
he
had
adopted
had
been
married
in
jhalone
to
a
person
who
resided
in
a
village
of
the
country
but
of
his
name
or
direction
he
was
ignorant
i
turned
away
from
the
door
i
dared
not
pass
my
own
and
i
withdrew
to
an
obscure
part
of
the
town
where
there
was
a
small
garden
in
which
a
fakeer
usually
resided
him
i
had
known
of
old
he
had
eaten
of
my
bread
and
received
my
alms
and
now
i
was
his
equal
he
will
not
recognize
me
thought
i
in
this
dress
and
changed
as
i
am
no
one
knows
me
i
will
seek
him
however
and
if
he
is
as
he
used
to
be
i
may
learn
some
news
of
my
old
friends
i
found
the
fakeer
i
sought
old
i
had
left
him
he
was
now
aged
and
infirm
his
garden
which
he
had
always
kept
with
scrupulous
neatness
was
overgrown
with
weeds
and
neglected
and
he
had
barely
strength
remaining
to
crawl
about
the
town
for
the
small
supply
of
flour
or
grain
which
sufficed
for
his
daily
wants
i
was
much
shocked
to
see
him
thus
and
representing
myself
to
be
a
wandering
kalundur
desirous
of
remaining
in
jhalone
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
reside
and
share
with
him
whatever
i
got
my
offer
was
readily
accepted
and
there
i
took
up
my
abode
in
the
hope
that
some
wandering
party
of
thugs
might
pass
jhalone
to
whom
i
could
disclose
myself
gradually
i
discovered
myself
to
the
old
man
i
led
him
to
speak
of
old
times
and
of
persons
by
allusion
to
whom
he
must
know
i
was
a
thug
he
did
not
hesitate
to
speak
of
them
and
in
particular
of
myself
whose
fate
he
mourned
with
such
true
grief
that
i
could
control
myself
no
longer
and
to
his
wondering
ear
i
related
the
whole
of
my
adventures
from
the
time
i
had
been
released
by
the
rajah
to
the
period
of
my
taking
up
my
abode
with
him
and
much
had
i
to
hear
from
him
in
return
much
that
distressed
and
grieved
me
many
of
my
old
companions
were
dead
others
had
been
seized
and
executed
and
hardly
one
of
the
old
leaders
of
bundelkhund
were
in
the
country
or
in
the
exercise
of
their
vocation
new
leaders
had
sprung
up
and
he
spoke
in
warm
terms
of
a
young
man
named
feringhea
who
when
i
had
last
seen
him
was
a
mere
boy
four
months
passed
thus
to
support
the
old
fakeer
as
well
as
myself
i
was
obliged
to
perambulate
the
town
daily
and
i
asked
and
received
alms
given
in
the
meanest
portions
in
the
place
where
my
hand
had
ever
been
open
to
the
poor
a
sad
change
in
my
fortune
sahib
yet
i
bore
up
against
it
with
resignation
if
not
with
fortitude
hoping
for
better
days
and
new
adventures
new
adventures
ameer
ali
i
exclaimed
had
not
the
punishments
you
had
received
turned
your
heart
from
thuggee
no
sahib
cried
the
thug
with
fervour
why
should
they
had
not
my
heart
become
hardened
by
oppression
and
misery
they
had
aroused
within
me
a
spirit
of
revenge
against
the
whole
human
race
i
burned
to
throw
off
my
wretched
disguise
and
again
take
to
the
road
it
mattered
not
whether
as
a
leader
or
a
subordinate
so
that
i
could
once
more
be
a
thug
nor
was
i
old
true
my
beard
had
become
grizzled
and
gray
and
care
had
seamed
my
countenance
with
many
wrinkles
but
i
was
still
strong
and
powerful
and
my
hands
had
not
forgotten
their
cunning
four
months
i
have
said
had
elapsed
and
as
no
thugs
came
near
jhalone
i
set
off
with
a
few
rupees
i
had
saved
from
the
produce
of
my
daily
alms
for
tearee
where
i
hoped
to
meet
the
brahmin
astrologer
who
had
so
materially
aided
me
in
the
affair
of
the
pearl
merchant
his
share
of
that
booty
had
been
duly
remitted
to
him
immediately
on
my
arrival
at
jhalone
and
though
i
had
never
heard
from
him
afterwards
yet
i
felt
assured
that
the
letter
could
not
have
miscarried
i
reached
tearee
after
many
days
i
knew
that
bands
of
thugs
were
abroad
for
i
saw
their
and
marks
at
many
villages
and
upon
the
roads
but
i
met
with
none
to
my
disappointment
and
on
my
arrival
i
hastened
at
once
to
the
temple
where
i
found
the
brahmin
and
notwithstanding
my
misfortunes
i
was
kindly
nay
warmly
welcomed
the
brahmin
still
kept
up
his
connection
with
thugs
and
i
learned
from
him
to
my
joy
that
a
band
under
a
jemadar
named
ramdeen
about
twenty
in
number
had
passed
through
the
town
only
the
day
before
and
were
on
their
road
towards
the
nerbudda
you
can
easily
overtake
them
meer
sahib
he
said
and
if
your
old
fame
as
a
leader
fails
in
procuring
you
a
welcome
reception
a
few
lines
from
me
may
aid
you
and
he
wrote
a
note
to
the
jemadar
informing
him
who
i
was
and
how
i
had
been
connected
with
him
of
old
i
did
not
long
delay
after
i
had
received
it
and
again
set
off
in
search
of
my
future
companions
i
came
up
with
them
on
the
second
day
and
warm
indeed
was
the
welcome
i
received
one
and
all
were
amazed
to
see
me
whom
they
had
long
thought
dead
i
was
clothed
in
decent
raiment
by
them
admitted
as
one
of
their
band
and
treated
as
a
brother
truly
their
kindness
was
refreshing
to
my
almost
withered
heart
ramdeen
insisted
that
i
should
take
an
equal
rank
with
him
in
the
band
and
after
the
necessary
ceremonies
i
resumed
my
roomal
and
in
a
few
days
again
ate
the
goor
of
the
tupounee
sahib
you
must
by
this
time
be
weary
of
my
adventures
with
travellers
and
i
met
with
none
during
my
connection
with
ramdeen
party
worthy
of
relation
we
avoided
the
company
territories
and
kept
to
those
of
sindia
penetrating
as
far
as
boorhanpoor
and
on
our
return
visiting
the
shrine
of
oonkar
manduttee
on
the
nerbudda
from
this
latter
place
we
were
fortunate
in
enticing
a
party
of
pilgrims
and
a
large
booty
fell
into
our
hands
at
the
bottom
of
the
jam
ghat
whither
we
escorted
them
on
their
return
to
oojein
upwards
of
four
hundred
rupees
was
my
share
of
this
so
again
you
see
me
independent
and
fortune
smiling
upon
me
but
ramdeen
became
jealous
of
me
and
of
my
superior
skill
and
intelligence
we
had
many
quarrels
and
at
last
i
left
him
and
determined
with
what
i
had
to
travel
to
the
dukhun
and
to
seek
my
fortune
in
the
nizam
country
where
i
knew
that
thuggee
still
flourished
unchecked
but
it
was
fated
not
to
be
so
my
road
from
where
i
left
ramdeen
lay
through
saugor
and
there
i
met
with
my
old
acquaintance
ganesha
at
the
head
of
a
small
band
apparently
in
wretched
plight
i
could
but
ill
dissemble
my
feelings
of
abhorrence
at
meeting
with
him
my
own
misfortunes
and
history
and
the
tale
of
my
companion
in
imprisonment
were
fresh
in
my
recollection
nevertheless
i
disguised
the
dislike
i
felt
though
revenge
still
rankled
in
my
heart
and
i
would
gladly
have
seized
any
opportunity
to
satisfy
it
among
his
band
was
a
thug
i
had
known
in
former
days
he
was
weary
of
ganesha
whose
temper
was
not
improved
by
age
and
he
advised
me
to
put
myself
at
the
head
of
a
few
men
he
could
point
out
to
me
who
would
be
faithful
and
who
he
thought
would
prove
the
nucleus
of
a
large
band
for
my
name
was
still
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
older
thugs
who
would
gladly
flock
to
me
when
they
heard
i
was
determined
to
set
up
for
myself
without
connexion
with
others
and
he
was
right
in
a
few
months
i
was
at
the
head
of
forty
men
and
we
were
fortunate
taking
a
new
direction
we
passed
through
the
territories
of
the
rewah
rajah
returning
to
our
home
which
we
fixed
in
a
village
not
far
from
hindia
in
a
wild
and
unfrequented
tract
where
we
were
secure
from
treachery
and
from
the
operations
against
the
thugs
then
being
carried
on
from
saugor
two
years
passed
in
this
manner
and
i
was
content
for
i
was
as
i
wished
to
be
powerful
and
actively
employed
two
seasons
we
went
out
and
returned
laden
with
plunder
and
the
name
of
ameer
ali
was
again
known
and
feared
another
season
and
it
shall
be
my
last
said
i
i
had
discovered
some
clue
to
my
daughter
and
thought
vain
idea
if
i
could
only
collect
a
few
thousand
rupees
that
i
could
dare
to
seek
her
to
live
near
her
and
to
abandon
thuggee
for
ever
why
was
i
thus
infatuated
what
else
could
it
have
been
but
that
inexorable
fate
forbade
it
the
destiny
which
had
been
marked
out
for
me
by
alla
i
was
to
fulfil
and
i
blindly
strove
against
it
the
vain
purposes
of
man
urge
him
to
pursue
some
phantom
of
his
imagination
which
is
never
overtaken
but
which
leads
him
on
often
by
smooth
paths
and
buoyed
up
by
hope
till
he
is
suddenly
precipitated
into
destruction
i
had
planned
an
expedition
on
a
larger
scale
than
ever
towards
calcutta
and
we
had
sworn
to
bhowanee
to
pay
our
devotions
at
her
shrines
of
bindachul
and
calcutta
the
omens
were
favourable
and
we
left
our
home
in
joy
and
high
excitement
and
what
cared
i
then
though
i
knew
that
the
english
had
set
a
price
of
five
hundred
rupees
upon
me
it
was
a
proof
that
i
was
dreaded
and
feared
and
i
rejoiced
that
ameer
ali
the
oppressed
and
despised
for
a
time
had
again
emerged
from
his
obscurity
and
i
braved
the
danger
which
threatened
me
i
was
a
fool
for
this
yet
it
was
my
destiny
that
impelled
me
and
of
what
avail
would
have
been
precautions
even
had
i
taken
any
i
knew
that
treachery
could
not
reach
me
where
i
was
and
i
trusted
to
my
apparently
lasting
new
run
of
good
fortune
and
to
the
omens
with
which
our
expedition
had
begun
to
escape
apprehension
in
the
districts
of
the
company
territories
where
operations
against
thugs
were
being
carried
on
with
much
success
saugor
lay
directly
in
the
route
which
we
proposed
taking
and
it
was
here
that
the
greatest
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
i
might
have
avoided
it
perhaps
but
i
trusted
to
the
celerity
and
secrecy
of
my
movements
for
a
few
days
until
we
should
pass
it
and
as
my
band
were
unanimous
in
refusing
to
change
the
route
after
it
had
been
determined
on
and
sanctioned
by
favourable
omens
i
undertook
to
lead
them
at
all
hazards
we
travelled
by
night
therefore
and
avoided
all
large
villages
resting
either
in
waste
spots
or
near
miserable
hamlets
nor
did
we
seek
for
bunij
the
danger
was
too
imminent
for
any
time
to
be
lost
and
though
one
or
two
persons
died
by
our
hands
yet
this
was
rather
to
enable
us
to
eat
the
goor
of
the
tupounee
and
to
perform
such
ceremonies
as
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
propitiation
of
our
patroness
and
our
consequent
success
conclusion
saugor
i
have
said
lay
directly
in
our
route
and
we
reached
a
village
close
to
it
on
the
evening
of
a
day
of
severe
travel
we
were
fatigued
already
but
the
town
was
now
so
close
to
us
that
we
did
not
hesitate
to
push
on
and
we
arrived
at
the
spot
shortly
after
dark
selecting
an
empty
shed
in
as
lonely
a
part
of
the
town
as
we
could
we
cooked
a
hasty
meal
and
lay
down
determined
to
rise
before
dawn
and
again
pursue
our
journey
one
of
our
number
was
set
to
watch
ere
we
retired
to
rest
and
we
depended
upon
him
to
give
us
warning
should
any
suspicious
person
be
observed
the
night
passed
and
i
arose
roused
my
followers
and
long
before
day
had
dawned
we
were
beyond
the
gates
of
the
town
see
said
i
to
my
friend
our
danger
is
past
we
are
now
again
on
our
way
and
we
shall
leave
this
spot
at
least
ten
coss
behind
us
before
noon
beyond
that
there
is
nothing
to
fear
and
we
shall
travel
with
light
hearts
alas
i
spoke
as
my
sanguine
hope
prompted
me
to
do
but
it
was
not
fated
to
be
as
we
thought
again
treachery
had
been
at
work
and
when
i
conceived
i
possessed
a
band
free
from
all
suspicion
two
traitors
as
i
afterwards
heard
had
already
laid
a
deep
plan
for
my
apprehension
of
this
however
i
will
tell
you
hereafter
you
are
now
with
me
on
the
road
and
you
see
us
urging
our
course
with
the
utmost
speed
already
had
we
lost
sight
of
the
town
and
before
us
was
a
broad
road
which
i
well
remembered
yet
i
feared
so
public
a
route
and
determined
to
strike
off
into
a
as
soon
as
i
could
see
one
which
diverged
in
the
direction
we
were
going
we
might
have
proceeded
a
coss
or
two
perhaps
and
the
day
was
now
beginning
to
dawn
a
nulla
was
before
us
at
a
short
distance
and
as
none
of
us
had
washed
before
leaving
the
town
i
proposed
that
we
should
perform
our
ablutions
there
the
better
to
enable
us
to
sustain
the
fatigue
of
the
stage
before
us
my
proposal
was
agreed
to
and
when
we
reached
the
running
stream
one
and
all
ungirded
their
loins
and
sat
down
by
the
water
we
had
not
been
engaged
thus
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
a
sudden
rush
was
made
upon
us
by
a
number
of
horse
and
foot
soldiers
who
must
have
been
lying
in
wait
for
us
on
the
road
we
were
to
travel
i
had
left
my
weapons
at
some
little
distance
from
the
water
and
my
first
impulse
was
to
endeavour
to
possess
myself
of
them
but
in
this
i
was
foiled
two
of
my
own
men
threw
themselves
upon
me
and
held
me
and
as
i
vainly
struggled
to
free
myself
some
seized
me
i
was
thrown
down
and
bound
the
surprise
was
most
complete
a
few
of
my
band
drew
their
swords
and
some
blows
were
exchanged
between
them
and
the
party
who
had
come
upon
us
and
a
few
of
my
thugs
were
wounded
but
we
were
all
overpowered
and
the
whole
affair
was
concluded
in
less
time
than
it
requires
to
relate
it
only
a
few
of
my
men
escaped
bitterly
did
i
upbraid
the
men
who
had
prevented
my
getting
at
my
weapons
had
i
but
possessed
them
ameer
ali
would
never
have
been
taken
alive
i
would
have
sold
my
life
dearly
sahib
and
sooner
than
have
been
seized
i
would
have
plunged
my
sword
into
my
heart
and
ended
a
life
which
had
no
charms
for
me
and
which
i
only
wished
to
prolong
to
wreak
vengeance
on
mankind
the
source
of
all
my
misery
as
i
reviled
them
they
mocked
and
jeered
at
me
where
is
now
your
journey
to
calcutta
o
meer
sahib
said
one
behold
the
long
travel
is
saved
thee
and
thou
art
returning
to
saugor
to
live
in
a
fine
house
and
to
keep
company
with
many
old
friends
who
are
in
it
yes
said
the
other
the
jemadar
day
is
past
and
his
wit
deserted
him
when
he
must
needs
approach
the
den
of
the
tiger
as
if
he
would
not
be
smelt
out
why
didst
thou
come
to
saugor
o
jemadar
hadst
thou
forgotten
the
promise
of
reward
and
free
pardon
which
was
offered
for
thy
apprehension
truly
we
have
done
a
good
deed
said
he
to
the
other
and
the
will
be
pleased
with
us
but
their
idle
talk
was
silenced
by
the
leader
of
the
party
who
warned
them
to
be
careful
and
not
to
boast
lest
their
expectations
should
not
be
realized
and
they
shrunk
behind
unable
to
bear
the
glances
of
scorn
and
contempt
which
were
cast
on
them
by
all
by
i
say
for
even
the
soldiers
who
had
seized
us
cursed
the
means
of
their
success
for
having
been
treacherous
and
unfaithful
to
the
salt
they
had
eaten
and
thus
in
bitter
agony
of
spirit
and
indulging
vain
regrets
at
my
senseless
imprudence
in
approaching
saugor
they
led
me
bound
and
guarded
by
the
road
i
had
just
travelled
free
then
as
the
morning
breeze
which
played
on
me
for
the
third
time
i
was
a
prisoner
and
now
i
saw
no
hope
i
had
retained
some
on
each
of
the
former
occasions
but
it
all
vanished
now
then
i
was
young
and
a
young
heart
is
always
buoyant
and
but
the
fire
of
my
spirit
had
long
been
quenched
and
it
was
only
in
the
wild
excitement
of
a
life
of
continual
adventure
and
unrestrained
freedom
when
i
resembled
what
i
had
formerly
been
that
it
rekindled
within
me
death
too
was
now
before
me
for
i
knew
the
inexorable
laws
of
the
europeans
and
that
no
mercy
was
shown
to
thugs
of
any
grade
how
much
less
to
me
for
whom
a
reward
had
been
offered
it
was
a
bitter
thought
i
should
be
hung
hung
like
a
dog
i
who
ought
to
have
died
on
a
death
would
have
been
sweet
and
followed
by
an
everlasting
paradise
alas
even
this
hope
deserted
me
now
and
i
felt
that
the
load
of
crime
with
which
my
soul
was
oppressed
would
weigh
me
down
into
hell
who
can
describe
the
myriad
thoughts
which
crowd
into
the
heart
at
such
a
moment
one
by
one
they
hurry
in
each
striving
to
displace
the
foregoing
none
staying
for
an
instant
till
the
brain
reels
under
the
confusion
it
was
thus
with
me
i
walked
mechanically
surrounded
by
the
soldiers
vainly
striving
to
collect
my
wandering
senses
to
sustain
me
in
the
coming
scene
the
scene
of
death
for
i
verily
believed
i
should
be
led
to
instant
execution
why
should
the
mockery
of
a
trial
be
given
to
one
so
steeped
in
crime
as
i
was
a
short
time
after
our
arrival
at
the
town
i
was
conducted
closely
guarded
to
the
officer
who
was
employed
by
the
english
government
to
apprehend
thugs
a
tall
person
he
was
and
from
the
severe
glance
he
cast
on
me
i
thought
my
hour
was
come
and
that
ere
night
i
should
cease
to
exist
i
had
prepared
myself
however
for
the
worst
i
saw
no
pity
in
his
stern
countenance
and
i
confess
i
trembled
when
he
addressed
me
so
you
are
ameer
ali
jemadar
said
he
and
at
last
you
are
in
my
power
know
you
aught
of
the
accusations
against
you
and
wherefore
you
are
here
read
them
he
continued
to
an
attendant
moonshee
read
the
list
which
has
been
drawn
up
yonder
villain
looks
as
though
he
would
deny
them
the
man
unfolded
a
roll
of
paper
written
in
persian
and
read
a
catalogue
of
crime
of
murders
every
one
of
which
i
knew
to
be
true
a
faithful
record
it
was
of
my
past
life
with
but
few
omissions
alla
defend
me
thought
i
there
is
no
hope
yet
still
i
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
the
proof
sahib
bahadur
said
i
you
english
are
praised
for
your
justice
and
long
as
that
list
is
of
crimes
i
never
before
heard
of
you
will
not
deny
me
a
fair
hearing
and
the
justice
you
give
to
thousands
surely
not
whatever
your
crimes
may
be
do
not
fear
that
your
case
shall
be
inquired
into
call
the
approvers
said
he
to
an
attendant
bring
them
in
one
by
one
and
the
jemadar
shall
hear
what
they
have
told
me
about
him
the
first
man
who
entered
was
an
old
associate
of
mine
in
former
days
before
my
misfortunes
commenced
he
had
been
with
me
in
the
expedition
just
before
my
father
had
been
put
to
death
by
the
rajah
of
jhalone
which
i
have
minutely
described
to
you
and
he
related
the
whole
from
the
murder
of
the
moonshee
and
his
child
down
to
the
last
event
the
destruction
of
the
his
story
took
a
long
time
in
relating
and
the
whole
was
so
fresh
in
my
recollection
and
he
was
so
exact
and
true
in
its
details
that
i
could
not
answer
a
word
nor
put
a
single
question
to
shake
his
testimony
in
conclusion
he
referred
the
officer
to
the
rajah
of
jhalone
for
corroboration
of
the
whole
and
he
appealed
to
me
to
declare
whether
aught
he
had
said
was
false
not
only
said
he
do
you
know
meer
sahib
that
it
is
all
true
but
there
are
others
as
well
as
myself
who
can
speak
to
these
facts
and
know
moreover
that
many
graves
have
been
opened
and
the
remains
of
your
victims
have
been
disinterred
say
as
well
as
mine
i
replied
thrown
completely
off
my
guard
at
last
and
nettled
by
the
emphasis
he
had
placed
on
the
words
your
victims
you
had
as
much
to
do
with
them
as
myself
besides
did
you
not
aid
that
villain
ganesha
when
i
would
have
saved
the
child
of
the
moonshee
he
has
confessed
cried
many
voices
silence
said
the
officer
let
no
one
dare
to
speak
do
you
know
ameer
ali
what
you
have
said
are
you
aware
that
you
have
admitted
you
are
a
thug
it
is
useless
now
to
attempt
to
recall
my
words
said
i
doggedly
make
the
most
of
them
for
after
this
you
shall
wring
no
more
from
me
no
not
by
the
most
horrible
tortures
you
can
inflict
the
examination
however
proceeded
others
were
brought
forward
who
had
known
me
or
been
connected
with
me
in
thuggee
and
at
last
those
who
had
earned
the
reward
of
the
government
by
betraying
me
they
had
been
associated
with
me
for
the
last
two
years
and
they
related
what
i
had
done
and
where
the
bodies
of
the
murdered
were
lying
after
this
was
finished
and
all
the
depositions
recorded
i
was
remanded
to
prison
and
the
better
to
secure
me
i
was
not
only
loaded
with
irons
but
confined
in
a
cell
by
myself
after
many
days
which
elapsed
without
my
being
sent
for
and
when
i
had
concluded
that
my
fate
was
decided
the
moonshee
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
court
with
a
jemadar
of
nujeeb
and
two
of
the
approvers
came
to
me
ameer
ali
said
the
first
we
are
sent
by
the
sahib
bahadur
to
tell
you
of
your
fate
i
can
guess
it
said
i
i
am
to
suffer
with
the
rest
well
many
a
good
thug
has
thus
died
before
me
and
you
shall
see
that
ameer
ali
fears
not
death
you
have
guessed
rightly
said
the
moonshee
there
is
no
hope
for
you
your
final
trial
will
come
on
in
a
day
or
two
and
there
is
such
an
array
of
facts
against
you
and
the
accounts
from
the
rajah
of
jhalone
so
entirely
agree
with
the
statements
of
all
the
approvers
that
it
is
impossible
you
can
escape
death
or
if
you
do
escape
it
nothing
can
save
you
from
the
kala
panee
death
cried
i
death
at
once
ah
moonshee
you
have
influence
with
my
judges
you
can
prevent
my
being
sent
away
over
the
far
sea
never
to
behold
my
country
more
and
to
linger
out
the
remnant
of
my
days
in
a
strange
land
condemned
to
work
in
irons
these
hands
have
never
been
used
to
labour
how
shall
i
endure
it
death
is
indeed
welcome
compared
with
the
kala
panee
but
why
should
it
be
either
meer
sahib
asked
the
jemadar
your
life
or
death
is
in
your
own
hands
these
men
will
tell
you
how
they
are
treated
by
the
master
they
serve
and
you
may
be
like
them
if
you
are
wise
never
cried
i
never
shall
it
be
said
of
ameer
ali
that
he
betrayed
an
associate
listen
kumbukht
said
the
moonshee
we
are
not
come
to
use
entreaties
to
one
who
deserves
to
die
a
thousand
deaths
to
one
whose
name
is
a
terror
to
the
country
you
are
in
our
power
and
there
is
no
averting
your
fate
an
alternative
is
offered
which
you
may
accept
or
not
as
you
please
no
force
is
used
no
argument
shall
be
wasted
on
you
say
at
once
will
you
live
and
become
an
approver
like
the
rest
have
good
clothes
to
wear
and
food
to
eat
and
be
treated
with
consideration
or
wilt
you
die
the
death
of
a
dog
speak
my
time
is
precious
and
i
have
no
orders
to
bandy
words
with
you
accept
the
terms
ameer
ali
said
both
the
approvers
do
not
be
a
fool
and
throw
your
last
chance
of
life
away
i
mused
for
a
moment
what
was
life
to
me
should
it
ever
be
said
that
ameer
ali
had
become
a
traitor
and
for
the
sake
of
a
daily
pittance
of
food
and
the
boon
of
life
had
abandoned
his
profession
and
assisted
to
suppress
it
no
i
would
die
first
and
i
told
them
so
begone
said
i
take
this
message
to
your
employer
that
the
soul
of
ameer
ali
is
too
proud
to
accept
his
offer
and
that
he
scorns
it
death
has
no
terrors
for
him
yet
shame
everlasting
shame
has
they
left
me
and
i
mused
over
my
lot
i
was
to
die
that
was
determined
did
i
fear
death
not
at
first
i
looked
at
the
transition
as
one
that
would
lead
me
to
eternal
joys
to
paradise
to
my
father
and
azima
but
as
i
thought
again
and
again
other
reflections
crowded
on
my
spirit
i
was
to
die
but
how
not
like
a
man
or
a
soldier
but
like
a
miserable
thief
the
scorn
of
thousands
who
would
exult
in
my
dying
struggles
and
then
i
remembered
those
of
the
wretch
who
had
been
hung
before
my
eyes
when
bhudrinath
was
with
me
and
i
pictured
to
myself
the
agony
he
must
have
suffered
ere
life
was
extinct
the
shame
of
the
death
the
ignominy
which
would
never
leave
my
memory
all
these
weighed
heavily
on
me
on
the
other
hand
was
life
one
of
servitude
it
was
true
but
still
it
was
life
i
should
be
protected
and
i
might
once
more
perhaps
be
free
if
the
europeans
relented
towards
me
and
i
did
them
faithful
service
thus
i
debated
with
myself
for
many
days
at
last
i
was
warned
that
my
trial
would
come
on
the
next
day
it
was
clearly
the
crisis
of
my
fate
and
i
must
confess
it
the
fear
of
the
horrible
death
of
hanging
the
dread
of
the
kala
panee
and
the
advice
of
the
moonshee
caused
my
resolutions
of
dying
with
the
rest
to
give
way
to
a
desire
of
life
ganesha
too
crossed
my
thoughts
i
can
revenge
myself
now
thought
i
and
his
death
will
not
lie
at
my
door
i
knew
too
how
earnestly
his
capture
was
desired
and
that
i
alone
could
tell
where
he
was
to
be
found
and
of
his
probable
in
case
he
ever
escaped
from
us
my
determination
was
made
and
i
requested
that
the
moonshee
who
had
formerly
spoken
with
me
on
the
subject
might
be
sent
for
he
came
and
i
told
him
at
once
that
i
was
willing
to
accept
the
alternative
he
had
offered
ah
you
speak
like
a
wise
man
now
said
he
and
if
you
exert
yourself
in
the
service
you
have
embraced
and
prove
yourself
faithful
and
trustworthy
you
may
rely
upon
it
indulgences
as
far
as
can
be
granted
to
a
person
in
your
condition
will
be
allowed
to
you
hereafter
but
you
must
first
deserve
them
for
with
the
europeans
nothing
goes
by
favour
i
am
ready
i
replied
point
out
what
i
am
to
do
and
you
will
find
that
ameer
ali
can
be
true
to
the
salt
he
eats
then
come
it
is
still
early
and
i
will
take
you
at
once
to
the
court
there
you
will
receive
your
instructions
my
prison
irons
were
struck
off
and
a
light
steel
rod
with
a
ring
attached
to
it
fastened
about
my
right
leg
so
that
it
left
me
at
perfect
liberty
to
walk
but
not
to
run
and
i
was
duly
admitted
as
an
approver
under
the
threat
of
instant
execution
in
case
i
ever
neglected
my
duty
failed
to
give
information
where
i
really
possessed
it
or
abused
in
any
way
the
confidence
which
had
been
reposed
in
me
know
you
aught
of
ganesha
said
the
officer
to
me
i
do
sahib
bahadur
i
replied
i
know
him
well
you
have
offered
a
reward
for
him
as
you
did
for
me
and
yet
you
know
not
that
even
at
this
moment
he
is
within
a
few
coss
of
saugor
can
you
guide
my
people
to
him
he
asked
remember
this
is
the
first
matter
with
which
you
are
intrusted
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
require
you
to
use
your
utmost
intelligence
in
it
ganesha
is
wary
and
has
hitherto
evaded
every
attempt
which
has
been
made
to
apprehend
him
i
will
undertake
it
i
exclaimed
it
is
possible
he
does
not
know
of
my
capture
and
if
you
will
give
me
six
of
your
own
men
i
will
disguise
them
and
pledge
myself
to
bring
him
to
you
and
not
only
him
but
himmut
who
is
i
know
with
him
ha
cried
the
officer
himmut
also
he
is
as
bad
as
the
other
he
is
as
good
a
thug
i
replied
and
more
can
not
be
said
but
we
lose
time
select
your
men
let
them
be
the
bravest
and
most
active
you
have
their
weapons
may
be
needed
i
will
too
ask
you
for
a
sword
impossible
said
he
you
must
go
as
you
are
what
if
you
were
to
lead
my
men
into
destruction
i
drew
myself
up
proudly
trust
me
or
not
as
you
will
ameer
ali
is
no
liar
no
deceitful
villain
to
the
cause
he
serves
trust
me
and
you
make
me
doubly
true
to
your
interests
doubt
me
and
i
may
doubt
you
thou
speakest
boldly
said
he
and
i
will
trust
thee
let
him
have
his
own
weapon
he
added
to
an
attendant
and
now
you
must
be
gone
early
ameer
ali
the
men
await
you
without
this
instant
food
shall
not
pass
my
lips
till
i
have
taken
ganesha
i
left
him
i
found
the
men
six
fellows
well
armed
i
stripped
them
of
their
badges
of
office
and
made
them
throw
dust
on
their
garments
so
that
it
should
appear
they
had
travelled
far
the
iron
on
my
leg
i
secured
so
that
it
should
make
no
noise
and
not
be
visible
under
my
trowsers
and
i
put
the
party
in
motion
it
was
nearly
evening
and
avoiding
the
town
i
struck
at
once
into
the
open
country
if
we
travel
well
said
i
to
the
men
we
may
be
up
with
him
by
midnight
where
is
he
asked
the
leader
of
the
party
at
he
lives
with
the
potail
there
and
passes
for
a
hindoo
fakeer
by
gunga
i
have
seen
him
then
rejoined
the
fellow
he
is
tall
and
squints
does
he
not
that
is
the
man
said
i
you
would
hardly
have
thought
of
looking
for
him
so
near
you
no
indeed
had
we
known
it
we
might
have
captured
him
a
week
ago
now
you
are
sure
of
him
said
i
but
we
must
be
wary
will
you
trust
me
i
will
but
beware
how
you
attempt
to
escape
or
mislead
me
i
have
a
heavy
reckoning
to
settle
with
ganesha
he
murdered
my
mother
was
my
only
reply
we
reached
the
village
in
the
very
dead
of
night
everything
was
still
and
it
was
perfectly
dark
which
aided
my
purpose
for
my
face
could
not
be
distinguished
and
my
own
approach
to
the
house
would
not
be
noticed
now
said
i
to
the
nujeeb
you
alone
must
accompany
me
let
the
rest
of
your
men
stay
here
i
will
bring
ganesha
here
and
then
you
must
bind
him
do
you
fear
me
for
he
appeared
irresolute
nay
then
i
will
go
alone
and
tell
your
master
that
ye
are
cowards
that
will
not
do
either
cried
the
man
i
must
not
let
you
out
of
my
sight
my
orders
are
positive
so
go
i
must
and
if
i
do
not
return
said
he
to
his
associates
do
you
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
saugor
alone
and
say
that
i
am
murdered
i
laughed
there
is
no
fear
said
i
in
half
an
hour
or
less
we
shall
return
are
you
ready
i
am
meer
sahib
lead
on
and
remember
that
my
sword
is
loose
in
the
scabbard
i
may
die
but
thou
shalt
also
fool
said
i
can
not
you
trust
me
not
yet
he
replied
i
may
do
so
hereafter
remember
i
continued
that
you
are
neither
to
speak
to
ganesha
nor
the
other
if
he
is
here
i
will
get
them
out
of
the
house
after
that
look
well
to
your
weapon
if
they
attempt
to
escape
or
show
suspicion
of
our
real
errand
fall
on
himmut
when
i
ask
you
how
far
it
is
to
saugor
leave
me
to
deal
with
ganesha
we
are
two
to
two
and
ganesha
is
a
better
swordsman
than
the
other
you
will
remember
this
i
will
he
replied
i
will
stick
by
you
i
fear
not
now
for
i
see
you
are
faithful
a
few
more
steps
brought
us
to
the
potail
house
and
i
called
for
him
by
name
jeswunt
jeswunt
rouse
yourself
and
come
out
man
thou
knowest
who
i
am
i
spoke
in
ramasee
which
i
knew
he
understood
he
answered
me
from
within
and
soon
after
i
heard
the
bars
and
bolts
of
his
door
removed
and
he
came
forth
wrapped
in
a
sheet
who
calls
me
he
asked
i
your
friend
ameer
ali
i
replied
where
is
ganesha
asleep
within
why
do
you
ask
and
himmut
asleep
also
what
do
ye
want
with
either
and
what
brings
you
here
meer
sahib
so
late
or
so
early
which
you
please
we
thought
you
were
half
way
to
calcutta
ah
said
i
that
matter
has
been
given
up
the
nujeebs
were
out
and
there
was
risk
but
go
and
rouse
ganesha
i
have
some
work
in
hand
for
him
and
have
no
time
to
lose
it
must
be
finished
by
daylight
i
understand
said
the
potail
some
bunij
eh
do
not
stand
chattering
there
or
your
share
may
be
forgotten
potailjee
bring
ganesha
to
me
or
tell
him
i
am
here
he
will
come
fast
enough
he
went
in
now
be
ready
said
i
to
the
nujeeb
do
as
i
do
and
remember
the
signal
i
heard
the
potail
awaken
ganesha
i
heard
the
growling
tones
of
his
voice
as
he
first
abused
him
for
rousing
him
and
afterwards
his
eager
question
ameer
ali
here
ai
bhowanee
what
can
he
require
of
me
at
length
his
gaunt
figure
appeared
at
the
doorway
ya
alla
how
my
heart
bounded
within
me
and
then
sickened
so
intense
was
my
excitement
on
beholding
him
where
art
thou
ameer
ali
said
he
i
can
see
nought
in
this
accursed
darkness
here
said
i
you
will
see
well
enough
when
your
eye
is
accustomed
to
it
give
me
your
hand
now
descend
the
step
that
is
right
we
embraced
each
other
are
you
ready
for
work
i
asked
i
have
only
two
men
with
me
and
we
have
picked
up
some
bunij
there
will
be
good
spoil
too
if
you
will
join
us
alone
we
can
do
nothing
there
are
four
of
them
where
he
asked
yonder
in
the
lane
i
have
pretended
to
come
for
fire
who
is
that
with
you
a
friend
no
fear
of
him
he
is
one
of
us
does
he
speak
ramasee
not
yet
said
i
he
is
a
new
hand
but
a
promising
one
but
where
is
himmut
within
snoring
there
you
may
even
hear
him
wait
for
me
a
moment
i
will
go
for
my
sword
and
shoes
and
rouse
him
up
four
men
you
said
and
we
are
five
enough
by
bhowanee
we
will
share
the
spoil
before
you
are
two
hours
older
be
quick
or
they
may
suspect
me
he
went
in
and
returned
in
a
short
time
fully
equipped
himmut
accompanied
him
and
we
exchanged
salutations
now
come
along
said
i
there
is
no
time
to
lose
hark
ye
said
ganesha
there
is
a
well
in
yonder
lane
will
that
do
for
the
bhil
certainly
i
replied
you
will
see
the
men
directly
soon
after
i
had
spoken
we
approached
our
party
who
goes
there
cried
one
of
them
a
friend
ameer
ali
then
all
is
right
was
the
reply
and
in
another
instant
we
had
joined
them
there
are
your
men
seize
them
cried
i
throwing
myself
upon
ganesha
with
such
violence
that
we
fell
to
the
ground
together
struggling
with
deadly
hate
but
two
of
the
nujeebs
came
to
my
aid
just
as
ganesha
had
succeeded
in
drawing
a
small
dagger
he
wore
in
his
girdle
and
as
i
had
fortunately
seized
his
hand
bind
him
hand
and
foot
said
i
disengaging
myself
from
him
and
gag
him
or
he
may
alarm
the
village
by
his
cries
this
was
done
and
he
was
disarmed
a
cloth
was
tied
round
his
mouth
so
that
he
could
not
speak
and
we
hurried
our
prisoners
along
as
fast
as
the
darkness
and
the
roughness
of
the
road
would
allow
none
of
us
spoke
nor
was
it
till
the
day
had
fully
dawned
that
i
looked
upon
ganesha
then
our
eyes
met
and
the
furious
expression
of
his
face
i
shall
never
forget
take
the
gag
from
his
mouth
said
i
to
one
of
the
nujeebs
let
him
speak
if
he
wishes
it
was
done
you
are
revenged
at
last
ameer
ali
he
said
may
my
curses
cleave
to
you
for
ever
and
the
curses
of
bhowanee
fall
on
you
for
the
destruction
of
her
votary
may
the
salt
you
eat
be
bitter
in
your
mouth
and
your
food
poison
to
you
ameen
said
i
you
have
spoken
like
ganesha
i
am
indeed
revenged
but
the
debt
is
not
paid
yet
the
debt
you
owe
me
for
my
mother
life
devil
you
murdered
her
ay
and
would
have
murdered
you
when
you
were
a
weak
puling
child
but
for
that
fool
ismail
he
met
his
fate
however
and
yours
is
yet
in
store
for
you
you
will
not
see
it
said
i
and
when
i
behold
you
hung
up
like
a
dog
i
shall
be
happy
peace
exclaimed
the
leader
of
the
nujeebs
why
do
you
waste
words
on
him
ameer
ali
because
i
am
glutting
my
soul
with
his
sufferings
i
answered
and
had
i
my
will
i
would
stand
by
and
taunt
him
till
the
hour
of
his
death
did
he
not
murder
my
mother
and
if
he
had
not
should
i
have
murdered
my
sister
have
i
not
cause
for
deep
and
deadly
hate
yet
i
will
be
silent
now
we
reached
saugor
and
the
delight
with
which
the
officer
received
ganesha
from
my
hands
could
not
be
concealed
a
deep
blow
has
been
struck
at
thuggee
in
the
capture
of
this
villain
said
he
and
thou
hast
done
thy
duty
well
ameer
ali
from
that
hour
i
rose
in
his
confidence
and
estimation
and
i
have
never
forfeited
it
ganesha
trial
came
on
and
i
was
the
principal
witness
against
him
i
told
all
i
knew
of
the
murders
he
had
committed
and
others
corroborated
my
statements
in
the
fullest
manner
he
was
sentenced
to
die
in
vain
was
it
that
i
entreated
to
see
him
before
his
execution
i
wanted
to
taunt
him
with
his
fate
and
to
embitter
his
last
hours
if
anything
i
could
have
said
might
have
done
so
it
was
denied
me
the
officer
knew
of
my
purpose
and
was
too
humane
to
allow
it
but
i
saw
him
die
him
and
twenty
others
all
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
me
too
and
cursed
me
but
his
curses
were
impotent
they
all
ascended
the
fatal
drop
together
refused
the
polluting
touch
of
the
hangman
adjusted
the
ropes
round
their
own
necks
and
exclaiming
victory
to
bhowanee
seized
each
other
hands
and
leaped
from
the
platform
into
eternity
i
watched
ganesha
and
i
joyed
to
see
that
his
struggles
were
protracted
beyond
those
of
the
others
i
was
satisfied
he
had
paid
the
debt
he
owed
me
and
now
sahib
after
this
event
my
life
became
one
of
dull
routine
and
inactivity
one
by
one
i
tracked
and
apprehended
my
old
associates
till
none
of
them
remained
at
large
the
usefulness
of
my
life
to
you
has
passed
away
and
all
that
i
can
do
is
at
times
to
relate
the
details
of
some
affair
i
may
either
have
witnessed
or
heard
from
others
why
should
i
live
is
a
question
i
often
ask
myself
why
should
an
existence
be
continued
to
me
in
which
i
have
no
enjoyment
no
pleasure
no
care
not
even
grief
i
have
remorse
but
for
one
act
and
that
will
never
leave
me
yet
i
must
support
it
until
alla
pleases
to
send
the
angel
to
loose
the
cord
which
binds
my
life
to
the
clay
it
inhabits
i
used
often
to
think
on
my
daughter
but
her
too
i
have
almost
forgotten
yet
i
should
not
say
forgotten
for
i
love
her
with
a
parent
affection
which
will
last
to
the
latest
moment
of
my
existence
but
she
is
happy
and
why
should
she
know
of
me
i
fear
that
i
have
often
wearied
you
by
the
minute
relation
of
my
history
but
i
have
told
all
nor
concealed
from
you
one
thought
one
feeling
much
less
any
act
which
at
this
distance
of
time
i
can
remember
possibly
you
may
have
recorded
what
may
prove
fearfully
interesting
to
your
friends
if
it
be
so
your
end
is
answered
you
have
given
a
faithful
portrait
of
a
