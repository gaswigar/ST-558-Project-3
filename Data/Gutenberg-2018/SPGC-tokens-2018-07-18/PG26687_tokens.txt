when
in
may
i
found
myself
at
last
in
paris
i
naturally
determined
to
throw
myself
on
the
charity
of
an
old
chum
of
mine
eugene
marie
who
had
forsaken
boston
a
year
or
more
ago
on
receiving
word
of
the
death
of
an
aunt
who
had
left
him
such
property
as
she
possessed
i
fancy
this
windfall
surprised
him
not
a
little
for
the
relations
between
the
aunt
and
nephew
had
never
been
cordial
judging
from
eugene
remarks
touching
the
lady
who
was
it
seems
a
more
or
less
wicked
and
old
person
with
a
penchant
for
black
magic
at
least
such
was
the
common
report
why
she
should
leave
all
her
property
to
no
one
could
tell
unless
it
was
that
she
felt
his
rather
hobbledehoy
tendencies
towards
buddhism
and
occultism
might
some
day
lead
him
to
her
own
unhallowed
height
of
questionable
illumination
to
be
sure
reviled
her
as
a
bad
old
woman
being
himself
in
that
state
of
enthusiastic
exaltation
which
sometimes
accompanies
a
boyish
fancy
for
occultism
but
in
spite
of
his
distant
and
repellent
attitude
mlle
blaye
de
tartas
made
him
her
sole
heir
to
the
violent
wrath
of
a
questionable
old
party
known
to
infamy
as
the
sar
torrevieja
the
king
of
the
sorcerers
this
malevolent
old
portent
whose
gray
and
crafty
face
was
often
seen
in
the
rue
le
prince
during
the
life
of
mlle
de
tartas
had
it
seems
fully
expected
to
enjoy
her
small
wealth
after
her
death
and
when
it
appeared
that
she
had
left
him
only
the
contents
of
the
gloomy
old
house
in
the
quartier
latin
giving
the
house
itself
and
all
else
of
which
she
died
possessed
to
her
nephew
in
america
the
sar
proceeded
to
remove
everything
from
the
place
and
then
to
curse
it
elaborately
and
comprehensively
together
with
all
those
who
should
ever
dwell
therein
whereupon
he
disappeared
this
final
episode
was
the
last
word
i
received
from
eugene
but
i
knew
the
number
of
the
house
rue
le
prince
so
after
a
day
or
two
given
to
a
first
cursory
survey
of
paris
i
started
across
the
seine
to
find
eugene
and
compel
him
to
do
the
honors
of
the
city
every
one
who
knows
the
latin
quarter
knows
the
rue
le
prince
running
up
the
hill
towards
the
garden
of
the
luxembourg
it
is
full
of
queer
houses
and
odd
corners
or
was
in
and
certainly
no
was
when
i
found
it
quite
as
queer
as
any
it
was
nothing
but
a
doorway
a
black
arch
of
old
stone
between
and
under
two
new
houses
painted
yellow
the
effect
of
this
bit
of
masonry
with
its
dirty
old
doors
and
rusty
broken
lantern
sticking
gaunt
and
grim
out
over
the
narrow
sidewalk
was
in
its
frame
of
fresh
plaster
sinister
in
the
extreme
i
wondered
if
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
number
it
was
quite
evident
that
no
one
lived
behind
those
cobwebs
i
went
into
the
doorway
of
one
of
the
new
hôtels
and
interviewed
the
concierge
no
did
not
live
there
though
to
be
sure
he
owned
the
mansion
he
himself
resided
in
meudon
in
the
country
house
of
the
late
mlle
de
tartas
would
monsieur
like
the
number
and
the
street
monsieur
would
like
them
extremely
so
i
took
the
card
that
the
concierge
wrote
for
me
and
forthwith
started
for
the
river
in
order
that
i
might
take
a
steamboat
for
meudon
by
one
of
those
coincidences
which
happen
so
often
being
quite
inexplicable
i
had
not
gone
twenty
paces
down
the
street
before
i
ran
directly
into
the
arms
of
eugene
in
three
minutes
we
were
sitting
in
the
queer
little
garden
of
the
chien
bleu
drinking
vermouth
and
absinthe
and
talking
it
all
over
you
do
not
live
in
your
aunt
house
i
said
at
last
interrogatively
no
but
if
this
sort
of
thing
keeps
on
i
shall
have
to
i
like
meudon
much
better
and
the
house
is
perfect
all
furnished
and
nothing
in
it
newer
than
the
last
century
you
must
come
out
with
me
and
see
it
i
have
got
a
jolly
room
fixed
up
for
my
buddha
but
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
house
opposite
i
ca
keep
a
tenant
in
it
not
four
days
i
have
had
three
all
within
six
months
but
the
stories
have
gone
around
and
a
man
would
as
soon
think
of
hiring
the
cour
des
comptes
to
live
in
as
no
it
is
notorious
the
fact
is
it
is
haunted
the
worst
way
i
laughed
and
ordered
more
vermouth
that
is
all
right
it
is
haunted
all
the
same
or
enough
to
keep
it
empty
and
the
funny
part
is
that
no
one
knows
it
is
haunted
nothing
is
ever
seen
nothing
heard
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
people
just
have
the
horrors
there
and
have
them
so
bad
they
have
to
go
to
the
hospital
afterwards
i
have
one
in
the
bicêtre
now
so
the
house
stands
empty
and
as
it
covers
considerable
ground
and
is
taxed
for
a
lot
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
i
think
i
either
give
it
to
that
child
of
sin
torrevieja
or
else
go
and
live
in
it
myself
i
should
mind
the
ghosts
i
am
sure
did
you
ever
stay
there
no
but
i
have
always
intended
to
and
in
fact
i
came
up
here
to
see
a
couple
of
fellows
i
know
fargeau
and
duchesne
doctors
in
the
clinical
hospital
beyond
here
up
by
the
parc
mont
souris
they
promised
that
they
would
spend
the
night
with
me
some
time
in
my
house
which
is
called
around
here
you
must
know
bouche
and
i
thought
perhaps
they
would
make
it
this
week
if
they
can
get
off
duty
come
up
with
me
while
i
see
them
and
then
we
can
go
across
the
river
to
véfour
and
have
some
luncheon
you
can
get
your
things
at
the
chatham
and
we
will
go
out
to
meudon
where
of
course
you
will
spend
the
night
with
me
the
plan
suited
me
perfectly
so
we
went
up
to
the
hospital
found
fargeau
who
declared
that
he
and
duchesne
were
ready
for
anything
the
nearer
the
real
bouche
the
better
that
the
following
thursday
they
would
both
be
off
duty
for
the
night
and
that
on
that
day
they
would
join
in
an
attempt
to
outwit
the
devil
and
clear
up
the
mystery
of
no
does
go
with
us
asked
fargeau
why
of
course
i
replied
i
intend
to
go
and
you
must
not
refuse
me
i
decline
to
be
put
off
here
is
a
chance
for
you
to
do
the
honors
of
your
city
in
a
manner
which
is
faultless
show
me
a
real
live
ghost
and
i
will
forgive
paris
for
having
lost
the
jardin
mabille
so
it
was
settled
later
we
went
down
to
meudon
and
ate
dinner
in
the
terrace
room
of
the
villa
which
was
all
that
had
said
and
more
so
utterly
was
its
atmosphere
that
of
the
seventeenth
century
at
dinner
eugene
told
me
more
about
his
late
aunt
and
the
queer
goings
on
in
the
old
house
mlle
blaye
lived
it
seems
all
alone
except
for
one
female
servant
of
her
own
age
a
severe
taciturn
creature
with
massive
breton
features
and
a
breton
tongue
whenever
she
vouchsafed
to
use
it
no
one
ever
was
seen
to
enter
the
door
of
no
except
jeanne
the
servant
and
the
sar
torrevieja
the
latter
coming
constantly
from
none
knew
whither
and
always
entering
indeed
the
neighbors
who
for
eleven
years
had
watched
the
old
sorcerer
sidle
up
to
the
bell
almost
every
day
declared
vociferously
that
had
he
been
seen
to
leave
the
house
once
when
they
decided
to
keep
absolute
guard
the
watcher
none
other
than
maître
garceau
of
the
chien
bleu
after
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
from
ten
one
morning
when
the
sar
arrived
until
four
in
the
afternoon
during
which
time
the
door
was
unopened
he
knew
this
for
had
he
not
gummed
a
stamp
over
the
joint
and
was
not
the
stamp
unbroken
nearly
fell
down
when
the
sinister
figure
of
torrevieja
slid
wickedly
by
him
with
a
dry
pardon
monsieur
and
disappeared
again
through
the
black
doorway
this
was
curious
for
no
was
entirely
surrounded
by
houses
its
only
windows
opening
on
a
courtyard
into
which
no
eye
could
look
from
the
hôtels
of
the
rue
le
prince
and
the
rue
de
and
the
mystery
was
one
of
the
choice
possessions
of
the
latin
quarter
once
a
year
the
austerity
of
the
place
was
broken
and
the
denizens
of
the
whole
quarter
stood
watching
many
carriages
drive
up
to
no
many
of
them
private
not
a
few
with
crests
on
the
door
panels
from
all
of
them
descending
veiled
female
figures
and
men
with
coat
collars
turned
up
then
followed
curious
sounds
of
music
from
within
and
those
whose
houses
joined
the
blank
walls
of
no
became
for
the
moment
popular
for
by
placing
the
ear
against
the
wall
strange
music
could
distinctly
be
heard
and
the
sound
of
monotonous
chanting
voices
now
and
then
by
dawn
the
last
guest
would
have
departed
and
for
another
year
the
hôtel
of
mlle
de
tartas
was
ominously
silent
eugene
declared
that
he
believed
it
was
a
celebration
of
walpurgisnacht
and
certainly
appearances
favored
such
a
fancy
a
queer
thing
about
the
whole
affair
is
he
said
the
fact
that
every
one
in
the
street
swears
that
about
a
month
ago
while
i
was
out
in
concarneau
for
a
visit
the
music
and
voices
were
heard
again
just
as
when
my
revered
aunt
was
in
the
flesh
the
house
was
perfectly
empty
as
i
tell
you
so
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
good
people
were
enjoying
an
hallucination
i
must
acknowledge
that
these
stories
did
not
reassure
me
in
fact
as
thursday
came
near
i
began
to
regret
a
little
my
determination
to
spend
the
night
in
the
house
i
was
too
vain
to
back
down
however
and
the
perfect
coolness
of
the
two
doctors
who
ran
down
tuesday
to
meudon
to
make
a
few
arrangements
caused
me
to
swear
that
i
would
die
of
fright
before
i
would
flinch
i
suppose
i
believed
more
or
less
in
ghosts
i
am
sure
now
that
i
am
older
i
believe
in
them
there
are
in
fact
few
things
i
can
believe
two
or
three
inexplicable
things
had
happened
to
me
and
although
this
was
before
my
adventure
with
rendel
in
pæstum
i
had
a
strong
predisposition
to
believe
some
things
that
i
could
not
explain
wherein
i
was
out
of
sympathy
with
the
age
well
to
come
to
the
memorable
night
of
the
twelfth
of
june
we
had
made
our
preparations
and
after
depositing
a
big
bag
inside
the
doors
of
no
went
across
to
the
chien
bleu
where
fargeau
and
duchesne
turned
up
promptly
and
we
sat
down
to
the
best
dinner
père
garceau
could
create
i
remember
i
hardly
felt
that
the
conversation
was
in
good
taste
it
began
with
various
stories
of
indian
fakirs
and
oriental
jugglery
matters
in
which
eugene
was
curiously
well
read
swerved
to
the
horrors
of
the
great
sepoy
mutiny
and
thus
to
reminiscences
of
the
by
this
time
we
had
drunk
more
or
less
and
duchesne
launched
into
a
photographic
and
zolaesque
account
of
the
only
time
as
he
said
when
he
was
possessed
of
the
panic
of
fear
namely
one
night
many
years
ago
when
he
was
locked
by
accident
into
the
of
the
loucine
together
with
several
cadavers
of
a
rather
unpleasant
nature
i
ventured
to
protest
mildly
against
the
choice
of
subjects
the
result
being
a
perfect
carnival
of
horrors
so
that
when
we
finally
drank
our
last
de
and
started
for
la
bouche
my
nerves
were
in
a
somewhat
rocky
condition
it
was
just
ten
when
we
came
into
the
street
a
hot
dead
wind
drifted
in
great
puffs
through
the
city
and
ragged
masses
of
vapor
swept
the
purple
sky
an
unsavory
night
altogether
one
of
those
nights
of
hopeless
lassitude
when
one
feels
if
one
is
at
home
like
doing
nothing
but
drink
mint
juleps
and
smoke
cigarettes
eugene
opened
the
creaking
door
and
tried
to
light
one
of
the
lanterns
but
the
gusty
wind
blew
out
every
match
and
we
finally
had
to
close
the
outer
doors
before
we
could
get
a
light
at
last
we
had
all
the
lanterns
going
and
i
began
to
look
around
curiously
we
were
in
a
long
vaulted
passage
partly
carriageway
partly
footpath
perfectly
bare
but
for
the
street
refuse
which
had
drifted
in
with
eddying
winds
beyond
lay
the
courtyard
a
curious
place
rendered
more
curious
still
by
the
fitful
moonlight
and
the
flashing
of
four
dark
lanterns
the
place
had
evidently
been
once
a
most
noble
palace
opposite
rose
the
oldest
portion
a
wall
of
the
time
of
francis
with
a
great
wisteria
vine
covering
half
the
wings
on
either
side
were
more
modern
seventeenth
century
and
ugly
while
towards
the
street
was
nothing
but
a
flat
unbroken
wall
the
great
bare
court
littered
with
bits
of
paper
blown
in
by
the
wind
fragments
of
packing
cases
and
straw
mysterious
with
flashing
lights
and
flaunting
shadows
while
low
masses
of
torn
vapor
drifted
overhead
hiding
then
revealing
the
stars
and
all
in
absolute
silence
not
even
the
sounds
of
the
streets
entering
this
place
was
weird
and
uncanny
in
the
extreme
i
must
confess
that
already
i
began
to
feel
a
slight
disposition
towards
the
horrors
but
with
that
curious
inconsequence
which
so
often
happens
in
the
case
of
those
who
are
deliberately
growing
scared
i
could
think
of
nothing
more
reassuring
than
those
delicious
verses
of
lewis
carroll
just
the
place
for
a
snark
i
have
said
it
twice
that
alone
should
encourage
the
crew
just
the
place
for
a
snark
i
have
said
it
thrice
what
i
tell
you
three
times
is
true
which
kept
repeating
themselves
over
and
over
in
my
brain
with
feverish
insistence
even
the
medical
students
had
stopped
their
chaffing
and
were
studying
the
surroundings
gravely
there
is
one
thing
certain
said
fargeau
might
have
happened
here
without
the
slightest
chance
of
discovery
did
ever
you
see
such
a
perfect
place
for
lawlessness
and
might
happen
here
now
with
the
same
certainty
of
impunity
continued
duchesne
lighting
his
pipe
the
snap
of
the
match
making
us
all
start
your
lamented
relative
was
certainly
well
fixed
she
had
full
scope
here
for
her
traditional
experiments
in
demonology
curse
me
if
i
do
believe
that
those
same
traditions
were
more
or
less
founded
on
fact
said
eugene
i
never
saw
this
court
under
these
conditions
before
but
i
could
believe
anything
now
what
that
nothing
but
a
door
slamming
said
duchesne
loudly
well
i
wish
doors
would
slam
in
houses
that
have
been
empty
eleven
months
it
is
irritating
and
duchesne
slipped
his
arm
through
mine
but
we
must
take
things
as
they
come
remember
we
have
to
deal
not
only
with
the
spectral
lumber
left
here
by
your
scarlet
aunt
but
as
well
with
the
supererogatory
curse
of
that
torrevieja
come
on
let
get
inside
before
the
hour
arrives
for
the
sheeted
dead
to
squeak
and
gibber
in
these
lonely
halls
light
your
pipes
your
tobacco
is
a
sure
protection
against
whoreson
dead
bodies
light
up
and
move
on
we
opened
the
hall
door
and
entered
a
vaulted
stone
vestibule
full
of
dust
and
cobwebby
there
is
nothing
on
this
floor
said
eugene
except
servants
rooms
and
offices
and
i
do
believe
there
is
anything
wrong
with
them
i
never
heard
that
there
was
any
way
let
go
up
stairs
so
far
as
we
could
see
the
house
was
apparently
perfectly
uninteresting
inside
all
work
the
façade
of
the
main
building
being
with
the
vestibule
the
only
portion
of
the
francis
work
the
place
was
burned
during
the
terror
said
eugene
for
my
from
whom
mlle
de
tartas
inherited
it
was
a
good
and
true
royalist
he
went
to
spain
after
the
revolution
and
did
not
come
back
until
the
accession
of
charles
when
he
restored
the
house
and
then
died
enormously
old
this
explains
why
it
is
all
so
new
the
old
spanish
sorcerer
to
whom
mlle
de
tartas
had
left
her
personal
property
had
done
his
work
thoroughly
the
house
was
absolutely
empty
even
the
wardrobes
and
bookcases
built
in
had
been
carried
away
we
went
through
room
after
room
finding
all
absolutely
dismantled
only
the
windows
and
doors
with
their
casings
the
parquet
floors
and
the
florid
renaissance
mantels
remaining
i
feel
better
remarked
fargeau
the
house
may
be
haunted
but
it
do
look
it
certainly
it
is
the
most
respectable
place
imaginable
just
you
wait
replied
eugene
these
are
only
the
state
apartments
which
my
aunt
seldom
used
except
perhaps
on
her
annual
come
up
stairs
and
i
will
show
you
a
better
en
on
this
floor
the
rooms
fronting
the
court
the
were
quite
small
they
are
the
bad
rooms
all
the
same
said
eugene
four
of
them
all
just
as
ordinary
in
appearance
as
those
below
a
corridor
ran
behind
them
connecting
with
the
wing
corridor
and
from
this
opened
a
door
unlike
any
of
the
other
doors
in
that
it
was
covered
with
green
baize
somewhat
eugene
selected
a
key
from
the
bunch
he
carried
unlocked
the
door
and
with
some
difficulty
forced
it
to
swing
inward
it
was
as
heavy
as
the
door
of
a
safe
we
are
now
he
said
on
the
very
threshold
of
hell
itself
these
rooms
in
here
were
my
scarlet
aunt
unholy
of
unholies
i
never
let
them
with
the
rest
of
the
house
but
keep
them
as
a
curiosity
i
only
wish
torrevieja
had
kept
out
as
it
was
he
looted
them
as
he
did
the
rest
of
the
house
and
nothing
is
left
but
the
walls
and
ceiling
and
floor
they
are
something
however
and
may
suggest
what
the
former
condition
must
have
been
tremble
and
enter
the
first
apartment
was
a
kind
of
anteroom
a
cube
of
perhaps
twenty
feet
each
way
without
windows
and
with
no
doors
except
that
by
which
we
entered
and
another
to
the
right
walls
floor
and
ceiling
were
covered
with
a
black
lacquer
brilliantly
polished
that
flashed
the
light
of
our
lanterns
in
a
thousand
intricate
reflections
it
was
like
the
inside
of
an
enormous
japanese
box
and
about
as
empty
from
this
we
passed
to
another
room
and
here
we
nearly
dropped
our
lanterns
the
room
was
circular
thirty
feet
or
so
in
diameter
covered
by
a
hemispherical
dome
walls
and
ceiling
were
dark
blue
spotted
with
gold
stars
and
reaching
from
floor
to
floor
across
the
dome
stretched
a
colossal
figure
in
red
lacquer
of
a
nude
woman
kneeling
her
legs
reaching
out
along
the
floor
on
either
side
her
head
touching
the
lintel
of
the
door
through
which
we
had
entered
her
arms
forming
its
sides
with
the
fore
arms
extended
and
stretching
along
the
walls
until
they
met
the
long
feet
the
most
astounding
misshapen
absolutely
terrifying
thing
i
think
i
ever
saw
from
the
navel
hung
a
great
white
object
like
the
traditional
roe
egg
of
the
arabian
nights
the
floor
was
of
red
lacquer
and
in
it
was
inlaid
a
pentagram
the
size
of
the
room
made
of
wide
strips
of
brass
in
the
centre
of
this
pentagram
was
a
circular
disk
of
black
stone
slightly
with
a
small
outlet
in
the
middle
the
effect
of
the
room
was
simply
crushing
with
this
gigantic
red
figure
crouched
over
it
all
the
staring
eyes
fixed
on
one
no
matter
what
his
position
none
of
us
spoke
so
oppressive
was
the
whole
thing
the
third
room
was
like
the
first
in
dimensions
but
instead
of
being
black
it
was
entirely
sheathed
with
plates
of
brass
walls
ceiling
and
floor
tarnished
now
and
turning
green
but
still
brilliant
under
the
lantern
light
in
the
middle
stood
an
oblong
altar
of
porphyry
its
longer
dimensions
on
the
axis
of
the
suite
of
rooms
and
at
one
end
opposite
the
range
of
doors
a
pedestal
of
black
basalt
this
was
all
three
rooms
stranger
than
these
even
in
their
emptiness
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
in
egypt
in
india
they
would
not
be
entirely
out
of
place
but
here
in
paris
in
a
commonplace
in
the
rue
le
prince
they
were
incredible
we
retraced
our
steps
eugene
closed
the
iron
door
with
its
baize
covering
and
we
went
into
one
of
the
front
chambers
and
sat
down
looking
at
each
other
nice
party
your
aunt
said
fargeau
nice
old
party
with
amiable
tastes
i
am
glad
we
are
not
to
spend
the
night
in
rooms
what
do
you
suppose
she
did
there
inquired
duchesne
i
know
more
or
less
about
black
art
but
that
series
of
rooms
is
too
much
for
me
my
impression
is
said
that
the
brazen
room
was
a
kind
of
sanctuary
containing
some
image
or
other
on
the
basalt
base
while
the
stone
in
front
was
really
an
altar
what
the
nature
of
the
sacrifice
might
be
i
do
even
guess
the
round
room
may
have
been
used
for
invocations
and
incantations
the
pentagram
looks
like
it
any
way
it
is
all
just
about
as
queer
and
de
as
i
can
well
imagine
look
here
it
is
nearly
twelve
let
dispose
of
ourselves
if
we
are
going
to
hunt
this
thing
down
the
four
chambers
on
this
floor
of
the
old
house
were
those
said
to
be
haunted
the
wings
being
quite
innocent
and
so
far
as
we
knew
the
floors
below
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
each
occupy
a
room
leaving
the
doors
open
with
the
lights
burning
and
at
the
slightest
cry
or
knock
we
were
all
to
rush
at
once
to
the
room
from
which
the
warning
sound
might
come
there
was
no
communication
between
the
rooms
to
be
sure
but
as
the
doors
all
opened
into
the
corridor
every
sound
was
plainly
audible
the
last
room
fell
to
me
and
i
looked
it
over
carefully
it
seemed
innocent
enough
a
commonplace
square
rather
lofty
parisian
finished
in
wood
painted
white
with
a
small
marble
mantel
a
dusty
floor
of
inlaid
maple
and
cherry
walls
hung
with
an
ordinary
french
paper
apparently
quite
new
and
two
deeply
embrasured
windows
looking
out
on
the
court
i
opened
the
swinging
sash
with
some
trouble
and
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
with
my
lantern
beside
me
trained
on
the
only
door
which
gave
on
the
corridor
the
wind
had
gone
down
and
it
was
very
still
without
still
and
hot
the
masses
of
luminous
vapor
were
gathering
thickly
overhead
no
longer
urged
by
the
gusty
wind
the
great
masses
of
rank
wisteria
leaves
with
here
and
there
a
second
blossoming
of
purple
flowers
hung
dead
over
the
window
in
the
sluggish
air
across
the
roofs
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
belated
in
the
streets
below
i
filled
my
pipe
again
and
waited
for
a
time
the
voices
of
the
men
in
the
other
rooms
were
a
companionship
and
at
first
i
shouted
to
them
now
and
then
but
my
voice
echoed
rather
unpleasantly
through
the
long
corridors
and
had
a
suggestive
way
of
reverberating
around
the
left
wing
beside
me
and
coming
out
at
a
broken
window
at
its
extremity
like
the
voice
of
another
man
i
soon
gave
up
my
attempts
at
conversation
and
devoted
myself
to
the
task
of
keeping
awake
it
was
not
easy
why
did
i
eat
that
lettuce
salad
at
père
garceau
i
should
have
known
better
it
was
making
me
irresistibly
sleepy
and
wakefulness
was
absolutely
necessary
it
was
certainly
gratifying
to
know
that
i
could
sleep
that
my
courage
was
by
me
to
that
extent
but
in
the
interests
of
science
i
must
keep
awake
but
almost
never
it
seemed
had
sleep
looked
so
desirable
half
a
hundred
times
nearly
i
would
doze
for
an
instant
only
to
awake
with
a
start
and
find
my
pipe
gone
out
nor
did
the
exertion
of
relighting
it
pull
me
together
i
struck
my
match
mechanically
and
with
the
first
puff
dropped
off
again
it
was
most
vexing
i
got
up
and
walked
around
the
room
it
was
most
annoying
my
cramped
position
had
almost
put
both
my
legs
to
sleep
i
could
hardly
stand
i
felt
numb
as
though
with
cold
there
was
no
longer
any
sound
from
the
other
rooms
nor
from
without
i
sank
down
in
my
window
seat
how
dark
it
was
growing
i
turned
up
the
lantern
that
pipe
again
how
obstinately
it
kept
going
out
and
my
last
match
was
gone
the
lantern
too
was
going
out
i
lifted
my
hand
to
turn
it
up
again
it
felt
like
lead
and
fell
beside
me
i
awoke
absolutely
i
remembered
the
story
of
the
haunters
and
the
haunted
was
the
horror
i
tried
to
rise
to
cry
out
my
body
was
like
lead
my
tongue
was
paralyzed
i
could
hardly
move
my
eyes
and
the
light
was
going
out
there
was
no
question
about
that
darker
and
darker
yet
little
by
little
the
pattern
of
the
paper
was
swallowed
up
in
the
advancing
night
a
prickling
numbness
gathered
in
every
nerve
my
right
arm
slipped
without
feeling
from
my
lap
to
my
side
and
i
could
not
raise
it
it
swung
helpless
a
thin
keen
humming
began
in
my
head
like
the
cicadas
on
a
hillside
in
september
the
darkness
was
coming
fast
yes
this
was
it
something
was
subjecting
me
body
and
mind
to
slow
paralysis
physically
i
was
already
dead
if
i
could
only
hold
my
mind
my
consciousness
i
might
still
be
safe
but
could
i
could
i
resist
the
mad
horror
of
this
silence
the
deepening
dark
the
creeping
numbness
i
knew
that
like
the
man
in
the
ghost
story
my
only
safety
lay
here
it
had
come
at
last
my
body
was
dead
i
could
no
longer
move
my
eyes
they
were
fixed
in
that
last
look
on
the
place
where
the
door
had
been
now
only
a
deepening
of
the
dark
utter
night
the
last
flicker
of
the
lantern
was
gone
i
sat
and
waited
my
mind
was
still
keen
but
how
long
would
it
last
there
was
a
limit
even
to
the
endurance
of
the
utter
panic
of
fear
then
the
end
began
in
the
velvet
blackness
came
two
white
eyes
milky
opalescent
small
far
away
awful
eyes
like
a
dead
dream
more
beautiful
than
i
can
describe
the
flakes
of
white
flame
moving
from
the
perimeter
inward
disappearing
in
the
centre
like
a
never
ending
flow
of
opal
water
into
a
circular
tunnel
i
could
not
have
moved
my
eyes
had
i
possessed
the
power
they
devoured
the
fearful
beautiful
things
that
grew
slowly
slowly
larger
fixed
on
me
advancing
growing
more
beautiful
the
white
flakes
of
light
sweeping
more
swiftly
into
the
blazing
vortices
the
awful
fascination
deepening
in
its
insane
intensity
as
the
white
vibrating
eyes
grew
nearer
larger
like
a
hideous
and
implacable
engine
of
death
the
eyes
of
the
unknown
horror
swelled
and
expanded
until
they
were
close
before
me
enormous
terrible
and
i
felt
a
slow
cold
wet
breath
propelled
with
mechanical
regularity
against
my
face
enveloping
me
in
its
fetid
mist
in
its
deadliness
with
ordinary
fear
goes
always
a
physical
terror
but
with
me
in
the
presence
of
this
unspeakable
thing
was
only
the
utter
and
awful
terror
of
the
mind
the
mad
fear
of
a
prolonged
and
ghostly
nightmare
again
and
again
i
tried
to
shriek
to
make
some
noise
but
physically
i
was
utterly
dead
i
could
only
feel
myself
go
mad
with
the
terror
of
hideous
death
the
eyes
were
close
on
me
their
movement
so
swift
that
they
seemed
to
be
but
palpitating
flames
the
dead
breath
was
around
me
like
the
depths
of
the
deepest
sea
suddenly
a
wet
icy
mouth
like
that
of
a
dead
shapeless
fell
over
mine
the
horror
began
slowly
to
draw
my
life
from
me
but
as
enormous
and
shuddering
folds
of
palpitating
jelly
swept
sinuously
around
me
my
will
came
back
my
body
awoke
with
the
reaction
of
final
fear
and
i
closed
with
the
nameless
death
that
enfolded
me
what
was
it
that
i
was
fighting
my
arms
sunk
through
the
unresisting
mass
that
was
turning
me
to
ice
moment
by
moment
new
folds
of
cold
jelly
swept
round
me
crushing
me
with
the
force
of
titans
i
fought
to
wrest
my
mouth
from
this
awful
thing
that
sealed
it
but
if
ever
i
succeeded
and
caught
a
single
breath
the
wet
sucking
mass
closed
over
my
face
again
before
i
could
cry
out
i
think
i
fought
for
hours
desperately
insanely
in
a
silence
that
was
more
hideous
than
any
sound
fought
until
i
felt
final
death
at
hand
until
the
memory
of
all
my
life
rushed
over
me
like
a
flood
until
i
no
longer
had
strength
to
wrench
my
face
from
that
hellish
succubus
until
with
a
last
mechanical
struggle
i
fell
and
yielded
to
death
then
i
heard
a
voice
say
if
he
is
dead
i
can
never
forgive
myself
i
was
to
blame
another
replied
he
is
not
dead
i
know
we
can
save
him
if
only
we
reach
the
hospital
in
time
drive
like
hell
twenty
francs
for
you
if
you
get
there
in
three
minutes
then
there
was
night
again
and
nothingness
until
i
suddenly
awoke
and
stared
around
i
lay
in
a
hospital
ward
very
white
and
sunny
some
yellow
stood
beside
the
head
of
the
pallet
and
a
tall
sister
of
mercy
sat
by
my
side
to
tell
the
story
in
a
few
words
i
was
in
the
hôtel
dieu
where
the
men
had
taken
me
that
fearful
night
of
the
twelfth
of
june
i
asked
for
fargeau
or
duchesne
and
by
and
by
the
latter
came
and
sitting
beside
the
bed
told
me
all
that
i
did
not
know
it
seems
that
they
had
sat
each
in
his
room
hour
after
hour
hearing
nothing
very
much
bored
and
disappointed
soon
after
two
fargeau
who
was
in
the
next
room
called
to
me
to
ask
if
i
was
awake
i
gave
no
reply
and
after
shouting
once
or
twice
he
took
his
lantern
and
came
to
investigate
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
he
instantly
called
and
duchesne
and
together
they
hurled
themselves
against
the
door
it
resisted
within
they
could
hear
irregular
footsteps
dashing
here
and
there
with
heavy
breathing
although
frozen
with
terror
they
fought
to
destroy
the
door
and
finally
succeeded
by
using
a
great
slab
of
marble
that
formed
the
shelf
of
the
mantel
in
fargeau
room
as
the
door
crashed
in
they
were
suddenly
hurled
back
against
the
walls
of
the
corridor
as
though
by
an
explosion
the
lanterns
were
extinguished
and
they
found
themselves
in
utter
silence
and
darkness
as
soon
as
they
recovered
from
the
shock
they
leaped
into
the
room
and
fell
over
my
body
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
they
lighted
one
of
the
lanterns
and
saw
the
strangest
sight
that
can
be
imagined
the
floor
and
walls
to
the
height
of
about
six
feet
were
running
with
something
that
seemed
like
stagnant
water
thick
glutinous
sickening
as
for
me
i
was
drenched
with
the
same
cursed
liquid
the
odor
of
musk
was
nauseating
they
dragged
me
away
stripped
off
my
clothing
wrapped
me
in
their
coats
and
hurried
to
the
hospital
thinking
me
perhaps
dead
soon
after
sunrise
left
the
hospital
being
assured
that
i
was
in
a
fair
way
to
recovery
with
time
and
with
fargeau
went
up
to
examine
by
daylight
the
traces
of
the
adventure
that
was
so
nearly
fatal
they
were
too
late
fire
engines
were
coming
down
the
street
as
they
passed
the
académie
a
neighbor
rushed
up
to
o
monsieur
what
misfortune
yet
what
fortune
it
is
true
bouche
i
beg
pardon
the
residence
of
the
lamented
mlle
de
tartas
was
burned
but
not
wholly
only
the
ancient
building
the
wings
were
saved
and
for
that
great
credit
is
due
the
brave
firemen
monsieur
will
remember
them
no
doubt
it
was
quite
true
whether
a
forgotten
lantern
overturned
in
the
excitement
had
done
the
work
or
whether
the
origin
of
the
fire
was
more
supernatural
it
was
certain
that
the
mouth
of
hell
was
no
more
a
last
engine
was
pumping
slowly
as
came
up
half
a
dozen
limp
and
one
distended
hose
stretched
through
the
and
within
only
the
façade
of
francis
remained
draped
still
with
the
black
stems
of
the
wisteria
beyond
lay
a
great
vacancy
where
thin
smoke
was
rising
slowly
every
floor
was
gone
and
the
strange
halls
of
mlle
blaye
de
tartas
were
only
a
memory
with
i
visited
the
place
last
year
but
in
the
stead
of
the
ancient
walls
was
then
only
a
new
and
ordinary
building
fresh
and
respectable
yet
the
wonderful
stories
of
the
old
still
lingered
in
the
quarter
and
will
hold
there
i
do
not
doubt
until
the
day
of
judgment
in
kropfsberg
keep
in
kropfsberg
keep
to
the
traveller
from
innsbrück
to
munich
up
the
lovely
valley
of
the
silver
inn
many
castles
appear
one
after
another
each
on
its
beetling
cliff
or
gentle
hill
appear
and
disappear
melting
into
the
dark
fir
trees
that
grow
so
thickly
on
every
side
laneck
lichtwer
ratholtz
tratzberg
matzen
kropfsberg
gathering
close
around
the
entrance
to
the
dark
and
wonderful
zillerthal
but
to
us
tom
rendel
and
myself
there
are
two
castles
only
not
the
gorgeous
and
princely
ambras
nor
the
noble
old
tratzberg
with
its
crowded
treasures
of
solemn
and
splendid
mediævalism
but
little
matzen
where
eager
hospitality
forms
the
new
life
of
a
chivalry
and
kropfsberg
ruined
tottering
blasted
by
fire
and
smitten
with
grievous
years
a
dead
thing
and
haunted
full
of
strange
legends
and
eloquent
of
mystery
and
tragedy
we
were
visiting
the
von
c
s
at
matzen
and
gaining
our
first
wondering
knowledge
of
the
courtly
cordial
castle
life
in
the
tyrol
of
the
gentle
and
delicate
hospitality
of
noble
austrians
brixleg
had
ceased
to
be
but
a
mark
on
a
map
and
had
become
a
place
of
rest
and
delight
a
home
for
homeless
wanderers
on
the
face
of
europe
while
schloss
matzen
was
a
synonym
for
all
that
was
gracious
and
kindly
and
beautiful
in
life
the
days
moved
on
in
a
golden
round
of
riding
and
driving
and
shooting
down
to
landl
and
thiersee
for
chamois
across
the
river
to
the
magic
achensee
up
the
zillerthal
across
the
schmerner
joch
even
to
the
railway
station
at
steinach
and
in
the
evenings
after
the
late
dinners
in
the
upper
hall
where
the
sleepy
hounds
leaned
against
our
chairs
looking
at
us
with
suppliant
eyes
in
the
evenings
when
the
fire
was
dying
away
in
the
hooded
fireplace
in
the
library
stories
stories
and
legends
and
fairy
tales
while
the
stiff
old
portraits
changed
countenance
constantly
under
the
flickering
firelight
and
the
sound
of
the
drifting
inn
came
softly
across
the
meadows
far
below
if
ever
i
tell
the
story
of
schloss
matzen
then
will
be
the
time
to
paint
the
too
inadequate
picture
of
this
fair
oasis
in
the
desert
of
travel
and
tourists
and
hotels
but
just
now
it
is
kropfsberg
the
silent
that
is
of
greater
importance
for
it
was
only
in
matzen
that
the
story
was
told
by
fräulein
e
the
niece
of
frau
von
c
one
hot
evening
in
july
when
we
were
sitting
in
the
great
west
window
of
the
after
a
long
ride
up
the
stallenthal
all
the
windows
were
open
to
catch
the
faint
wind
and
we
had
sat
for
a
long
time
watching
the
otzethaler
alps
turn
over
distant
innsbrück
then
deepen
to
violet
as
the
sun
went
down
and
the
white
mists
rose
slowly
until
lichtwer
and
laneck
and
kropfsberg
rose
like
craggy
islands
in
a
silver
sea
and
this
is
the
story
as
fräulein
e
told
it
to
us
the
story
of
kropfsberg
keep
a
great
many
years
ago
soon
after
my
grandfather
died
and
matzen
came
to
us
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
so
young
that
i
remember
nothing
of
the
affair
except
as
something
dreadful
that
frightened
me
very
much
two
young
men
who
had
studied
painting
with
my
grandfather
came
down
to
brixleg
from
munich
partly
to
paint
and
partly
to
amuse
themselves
as
they
said
for
they
were
very
sensible
young
men
and
prided
themselves
on
it
laughing
at
all
kinds
of
superstition
and
particularly
at
that
form
which
believed
in
ghosts
and
feared
them
they
had
never
seen
a
real
ghost
you
know
and
they
belonged
to
a
certain
set
of
people
who
believed
nothing
they
had
not
seen
themselves
which
always
seemed
to
me
conceited
well
they
knew
that
we
had
lots
of
beautiful
castles
here
in
the
lower
valley
and
they
assumed
and
rightly
that
every
castle
has
at
least
ghost
story
connected
with
it
so
they
chose
this
as
their
hunting
ground
only
the
game
they
sought
was
ghosts
not
chamois
their
plan
was
to
visit
every
place
that
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
and
to
meet
every
reputed
ghost
and
prove
that
it
really
was
no
ghost
at
all
there
was
a
little
inn
down
in
the
village
then
kept
by
an
old
man
named
peter
rosskopf
and
the
two
young
men
made
this
their
headquarters
the
very
first
night
they
began
to
draw
from
the
old
innkeeper
all
that
he
knew
of
legends
and
ghost
stories
connected
with
brixleg
and
its
castles
and
as
he
was
a
most
garrulous
old
gentleman
he
filled
them
with
the
wildest
delight
by
his
stories
of
the
ghosts
of
the
castles
about
the
mouth
of
the
zillerthal
of
course
the
old
man
believed
every
word
he
said
and
you
can
imagine
his
horror
and
amazement
when
after
telling
his
guests
the
particularly
story
of
kropfsberg
and
its
haunted
keep
the
elder
of
the
two
boys
whose
surname
i
have
forgotten
but
whose
christian
name
was
rupert
calmly
said
your
story
is
most
satisfactory
we
will
sleep
in
kropfsberg
keep
night
and
you
must
provide
us
with
all
that
we
may
need
to
make
ourselves
comfortable
the
old
man
nearly
fell
into
the
fire
what
for
a
blockhead
are
you
he
cried
with
big
eyes
the
keep
is
haunted
by
count
albert
ghost
i
tell
you
that
is
why
we
are
going
there
night
we
wish
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
count
albert
but
there
was
a
man
stayed
there
once
and
in
the
morning
he
was
dead
very
silly
of
him
there
are
two
of
us
and
we
carry
revolvers
but
it
a
i
tell
you
almost
screamed
the
innkeeper
are
ghosts
afraid
of
firearms
whether
they
are
or
not
we
are
afraid
of
here
the
younger
boy
broke
in
he
was
named
otto
von
kleist
i
remember
the
name
for
i
had
a
music
teacher
once
by
that
name
he
abused
the
poor
old
man
shamefully
told
him
that
they
were
going
to
spend
the
night
in
kropfsberg
in
spite
of
count
albert
and
peter
rosskopf
and
that
he
might
as
well
make
the
most
of
it
and
earn
his
money
with
cheerfulness
in
a
word
they
finally
bullied
the
old
fellow
into
submission
and
when
the
morning
came
he
set
about
preparing
for
the
suicide
as
he
considered
it
with
sighs
and
mutterings
and
ominous
shakings
of
the
head
you
know
the
condition
of
the
castle
now
nothing
but
scorched
walls
and
crumbling
piles
of
fallen
masonry
well
at
the
time
i
tell
you
of
the
keep
was
still
partially
preserved
it
was
finally
burned
out
only
a
few
years
ago
by
some
wicked
boys
who
came
over
from
jenbach
to
have
a
good
time
but
when
the
ghost
hunters
came
though
the
two
lower
floors
had
fallen
into
the
crypt
the
third
floor
remained
the
peasants
said
it
not
fall
but
that
it
would
stay
until
the
day
of
judgment
because
it
was
in
the
room
above
that
the
wicked
count
albert
sat
watching
the
flames
destroy
the
great
castle
and
his
imprisoned
guests
and
where
he
finally
hung
himself
in
a
suit
of
armor
that
had
belonged
to
his
mediæval
ancestor
the
first
count
kropfsberg
no
one
dared
touch
him
and
so
he
hung
there
for
twelve
years
and
all
the
time
venturesome
boys
and
daring
men
used
to
creep
up
the
turret
steps
and
stare
awfully
through
the
chinks
in
the
door
at
that
ghostly
mass
of
steel
that
held
within
itself
the
body
of
a
murderer
and
suicide
slowly
returning
to
the
dust
from
which
it
was
made
finally
it
disappeared
none
knew
whither
and
for
another
dozen
years
the
room
stood
empty
but
for
the
old
furniture
and
the
rotting
hangings
so
when
the
two
men
climbed
the
stairway
to
the
haunted
room
they
found
a
very
different
state
of
things
from
what
exists
now
the
room
was
absolutely
as
it
was
left
the
night
count
albert
burned
the
castle
except
that
all
trace
of
the
suspended
suit
of
armor
and
its
ghastly
contents
had
vanished
no
one
had
dared
to
cross
the
threshold
and
i
suppose
that
for
forty
years
no
living
thing
had
entered
that
dreadful
room
on
one
side
stood
a
vast
canopied
bed
of
black
wood
the
damask
hangings
of
which
were
covered
with
mould
and
mildew
all
the
clothing
of
the
bed
was
in
perfect
order
and
on
it
lay
a
book
open
and
face
downward
the
only
other
furniture
in
the
room
consisted
of
several
old
chairs
a
carved
oak
chest
and
a
big
inlaid
table
covered
with
books
and
papers
and
on
one
corner
two
or
three
bottles
with
dark
solid
sediment
at
the
bottom
and
a
glass
also
dark
with
the
dregs
of
wine
that
had
been
poured
out
almost
half
a
century
before
the
tapestry
on
the
walls
was
green
with
mould
but
hardly
torn
or
otherwise
defaced
for
although
the
heavy
dust
of
forty
years
lay
on
everything
the
room
had
been
preserved
from
further
harm
no
spider
web
was
to
be
seen
no
trace
of
nibbling
mice
not
even
a
dead
moth
or
fly
on
the
sills
of
the
windows
life
seemed
to
have
shunned
the
room
utterly
and
finally
the
men
looked
at
the
room
curiously
and
i
am
sure
not
without
some
feelings
of
awe
and
unacknowledged
fear
but
whatever
they
may
have
felt
of
instinctive
shrinking
they
said
nothing
and
quickly
set
to
work
to
make
the
room
passably
inhabitable
they
decided
to
touch
nothing
that
had
not
absolutely
to
be
changed
and
therefore
they
made
for
themselves
a
bed
in
one
corner
with
the
mattress
and
linen
from
the
inn
in
the
great
fireplace
they
piled
a
lot
of
wood
on
the
caked
ashes
of
a
fire
dead
for
forty
years
turned
the
old
chest
into
a
table
and
laid
out
on
it
all
their
arrangements
for
the
evening
amusement
food
two
or
three
bottles
of
wine
pipes
and
tobacco
and
the
that
was
their
inseparable
travelling
companion
all
this
they
did
themselves
the
innkeeper
would
not
even
come
within
the
walls
of
the
outer
court
he
insisted
that
he
had
washed
his
hands
of
the
whole
affair
the
silly
dunderheads
might
go
to
their
death
their
own
way
would
not
aid
and
abet
them
one
of
the
stable
boys
brought
the
basket
of
food
and
the
wood
and
the
bed
up
the
winding
stone
stairs
to
be
sure
but
neither
money
nor
prayers
nor
threats
would
bring
him
within
the
walls
of
the
accursed
place
and
he
stared
fearfully
at
the
boys
as
they
worked
around
the
dead
old
room
preparing
for
the
night
that
was
coming
so
fast
at
length
everything
was
in
readiness
and
after
a
final
visit
to
the
inn
for
dinner
rupert
and
otto
started
at
sunset
for
the
keep
half
the
village
went
with
them
for
peter
rosskopf
had
babbled
the
whole
story
to
an
crowd
of
wondering
men
and
women
and
as
to
an
execution
the
crowd
followed
the
two
boys
dumbly
curious
to
see
if
they
surely
would
put
their
plan
into
execution
but
none
went
farther
than
the
outer
doorway
of
the
stairs
for
it
was
already
growing
twilight
in
absolute
silence
they
watched
the
two
foolhardy
youths
with
their
lives
in
their
hands
enter
the
terrible
keep
standing
like
a
tower
in
the
midst
of
the
piles
of
stones
that
had
once
formed
walls
joining
it
with
the
mass
of
the
castle
beyond
when
a
moment
later
a
light
showed
itself
in
the
high
windows
above
they
sighed
resignedly
and
went
their
ways
to
wait
stolidly
until
morning
should
come
and
prove
the
truth
of
their
fears
and
warnings
in
the
mean
time
the
ghost
hunters
built
a
huge
fire
lighted
their
many
candles
and
sat
down
to
await
developments
rupert
afterwards
told
my
uncle
that
they
really
felt
no
fear
whatever
only
a
contemptuous
curiosity
and
they
ate
their
supper
with
good
appetite
and
an
unusual
relish
it
was
a
long
evening
they
played
many
games
of
chess
waiting
for
midnight
hour
passed
after
hour
and
nothing
occurred
to
interrupt
the
monotony
of
the
evening
ten
eleven
came
and
went
it
was
almost
midnight
they
piled
more
wood
in
the
fireplace
lighted
new
candles
looked
to
their
pistols
and
waited
the
clocks
in
the
village
struck
twelve
the
sound
coming
muffled
through
the
high
windows
nothing
happened
nothing
to
break
the
heavy
silence
and
with
a
feeling
of
disappointed
relief
they
looked
at
each
other
and
acknowledged
that
they
had
met
another
rebuff
finally
they
decided
that
there
was
no
use
in
sitting
up
and
boring
themselves
any
longer
they
had
much
better
rest
so
otto
threw
himself
down
on
the
mattress
falling
almost
immediately
asleep
rupert
sat
a
little
longer
smoking
and
watching
the
stars
creep
along
behind
the
shattered
glass
and
the
bent
leads
of
the
lofty
windows
watching
the
fire
fall
together
and
the
strange
shadows
move
mysteriously
on
the
mouldering
walls
the
iron
hook
in
the
oak
beam
that
crossed
the
ceiling
midway
fascinated
him
not
with
fear
but
morbidly
so
it
was
from
that
hook
that
for
twelve
years
twelve
long
years
of
changing
summer
and
winter
the
body
of
count
albert
murderer
and
suicide
hung
in
its
strange
casing
of
mediæval
steel
moving
a
little
at
first
and
turning
gently
while
the
fire
died
out
on
the
hearth
while
the
ruins
of
the
castle
grew
cold
and
horrified
peasants
sought
for
the
bodies
of
the
score
of
gay
reckless
wicked
guests
whom
count
albert
had
gathered
in
kropfsberg
for
a
last
debauch
gathered
to
their
terrible
and
untimely
death
what
a
strange
and
fiendish
idea
it
was
the
young
handsome
noble
who
had
ruined
himself
and
his
family
in
the
society
of
the
splendid
debauchees
gathering
them
all
together
men
and
women
who
had
known
only
love
and
pleasure
for
a
glorious
and
awful
riot
of
luxury
and
then
when
they
were
all
dancing
in
the
great
ballroom
locking
the
doors
and
burning
the
whole
castle
about
them
the
while
he
sat
in
the
great
keep
listening
to
their
screams
of
agonized
fear
watching
the
fire
sweep
from
wing
to
wing
until
the
whole
mighty
mass
was
one
enormous
and
awful
pyre
and
then
clothing
himself
in
his
armor
hanging
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
ruins
of
what
had
been
a
proud
and
noble
castle
so
ended
a
great
family
a
great
house
but
that
was
forty
years
ago
he
was
growing
drowsy
the
light
flickered
and
flared
in
the
fireplace
one
by
one
the
candles
went
out
the
shadows
grew
thick
in
the
room
why
did
that
great
iron
hook
stand
out
so
plainly
why
did
that
dark
shadow
dance
and
quiver
so
mockingly
behind
it
why
but
he
ceased
to
wonder
at
anything
he
was
asleep
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
woke
almost
immediately
the
fire
still
burned
though
low
and
fitfully
on
the
hearth
otto
was
sleeping
breathing
quietly
and
regularly
the
shadows
had
gathered
close
around
him
thick
and
murky
with
every
passing
moment
the
light
died
in
the
fireplace
he
felt
stiff
with
cold
in
the
utter
silence
he
heard
the
clock
in
the
village
strike
two
he
shivered
with
a
sudden
and
irresistible
feeling
of
fear
and
abruptly
turned
and
looked
towards
the
hook
in
the
ceiling
yes
it
was
there
he
knew
that
it
would
be
it
seemed
quite
natural
he
would
have
been
disappointed
had
he
seen
nothing
but
now
he
knew
that
the
story
was
true
knew
that
he
was
wrong
and
that
the
dead
sometimes
return
to
earth
for
there
in
the
shadow
hung
the
black
mass
of
wrought
steel
turning
a
little
now
and
then
with
the
light
flickering
on
the
tarnished
and
rusty
metal
he
watched
it
quietly
he
hardly
felt
afraid
it
was
rather
a
sentiment
of
sadness
and
fatality
that
filled
him
of
gloomy
forebodings
of
something
unknown
unimaginable
he
sat
and
watched
the
thing
disappear
in
the
gathering
dark
his
hand
on
his
pistol
as
it
lay
by
him
on
the
great
chest
there
was
no
sound
but
the
regular
breathing
of
the
sleeping
boy
on
the
mattress
it
had
grown
absolutely
dark
a
bat
fluttered
against
the
broken
glass
of
the
window
he
wondered
if
he
was
growing
mad
for
he
hesitated
to
acknowledge
it
to
himself
he
heard
music
far
curious
music
a
strange
and
luxurious
dance
very
faint
very
vague
but
unmistakable
like
a
flash
of
lightning
came
a
jagged
line
of
fire
down
the
blank
wall
opposite
him
a
line
that
remained
that
grew
wider
that
let
a
pale
cold
light
into
the
room
showing
him
now
all
its
details
the
empty
fireplace
where
a
thin
smoke
rose
in
a
spiral
from
a
bit
of
charred
wood
the
mass
of
the
great
bed
and
in
the
very
middle
black
against
the
curious
brightness
the
armored
man
or
ghost
or
devil
standing
not
suspended
beneath
the
rusty
hook
and
with
the
rending
of
the
wall
the
music
grew
more
distinct
though
sounding
still
very
very
far
away
count
albert
raised
his
mailed
hand
and
beckoned
to
him
then
turned
and
stood
in
the
riven
wall
without
a
word
rupert
rose
and
followed
him
his
pistol
in
hand
count
albert
passed
through
the
mighty
wall
and
disappeared
in
the
unearthly
light
rupert
followed
mechanically
he
felt
the
crushing
of
the
mortar
beneath
his
feet
the
roughness
of
the
jagged
wall
where
he
rested
his
hand
to
steady
himself
the
keep
rose
absolutely
isolated
among
the
ruins
yet
on
passing
through
the
wall
rupert
found
himself
in
a
long
uneven
corridor
the
floor
of
which
was
warped
and
sagging
while
the
walls
were
covered
on
one
side
with
big
faded
portraits
of
an
inferior
quality
like
those
in
the
corridor
that
connects
the
pitti
and
uffizzi
in
florence
before
him
moved
the
figure
of
count
albert
a
black
silhouette
in
the
light
and
always
the
music
grew
stronger
and
stranger
a
mad
evil
seductive
dance
that
bewitched
even
while
it
disgusted
in
a
final
blaze
of
vivid
intolerable
light
in
a
burst
of
hellish
music
that
might
have
come
from
bedlam
rupert
stepped
from
the
corridor
into
a
vast
and
curious
room
where
at
first
he
saw
nothing
distinguished
nothing
but
a
mad
seething
whirl
of
sweeping
figures
white
in
a
white
room
under
white
light
count
albert
standing
before
him
the
only
dark
object
to
be
seen
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
fearful
brightness
he
knew
that
he
was
looking
on
a
dance
such
as
the
damned
might
see
in
hell
but
such
as
no
living
man
had
ever
seen
before
around
the
long
narrow
hall
under
the
fearful
light
that
came
from
nowhere
but
was
omnipresent
swept
a
rushing
stream
of
unspeakable
horrors
dancing
insanely
laughing
gibbering
hideously
the
dead
of
forty
years
white
polished
skeletons
bare
of
flesh
and
vesture
skeletons
clothed
in
the
dreadful
rags
of
dried
and
rattling
sinews
the
tags
of
tattering
flaunting
behind
them
these
were
the
dead
of
many
years
ago
then
the
dead
of
more
recent
times
with
yellow
bones
showing
only
here
and
there
the
long
and
insecure
hair
of
their
hideous
heads
writhing
in
the
beating
air
then
green
and
gray
horrors
bloated
and
shapeless
stained
with
earth
or
dripping
with
spattering
water
and
here
and
there
white
beautiful
things
like
chiselled
ivory
the
dead
of
yesterday
locked
it
may
be
in
the
mummy
arms
of
rattling
skeletons
round
and
round
the
cursed
room
a
swaying
swirling
maelstrom
of
death
while
the
air
grew
thick
with
miasma
the
floor
foul
with
shreds
of
shrouds
and
yellow
parchment
clattering
bones
and
wisps
of
tangled
hair
and
in
the
very
midst
of
this
ring
of
death
a
sight
not
for
words
nor
for
thought
a
sight
to
blast
forever
the
mind
of
the
man
who
looked
upon
it
a
leaping
writhing
dance
of
count
albert
victims
the
score
of
beautiful
women
and
reckless
men
who
danced
to
their
awful
death
while
the
castle
burned
around
them
charred
and
shapeless
now
a
living
of
nameless
horror
count
albert
who
had
stood
silent
and
gloomy
watching
the
dance
of
the
damned
turned
to
rupert
and
for
the
first
time
spoke
we
are
ready
for
you
now
dance
a
prancing
horror
dead
some
dozen
years
perhaps
flaunted
from
the
rushing
river
of
the
dead
and
leered
at
rupert
with
eyeless
skull
dance
rupert
stood
frozen
motionless
dance
his
hard
lips
moved
not
if
the
devil
came
from
hell
to
make
me
count
albert
swept
his
vast
sword
into
the
f
oe
tid
air
while
the
tide
of
corruption
paused
in
its
swirling
and
swept
down
on
rupert
with
gibbering
grins
the
room
and
the
howling
dead
and
the
black
portent
before
him
circled
dizzily
around
as
with
a
last
effort
of
departing
consciousness
he
drew
his
pistol
and
fired
full
in
the
face
of
count
albert
perfect
silence
perfect
darkness
not
a
breath
not
a
sound
the
dead
stillness
of
a
tomb
rupert
lay
on
his
back
stunned
helpless
his
pistol
clenched
in
his
frozen
hand
a
smell
of
powder
in
the
black
air
where
was
he
dead
in
hell
he
reached
his
hand
out
cautiously
it
fell
on
dusty
boards
outside
far
away
a
clock
struck
three
had
he
dreamed
of
course
but
how
ghastly
a
dream
with
chattering
teeth
he
called
softly
otto
there
was
no
reply
and
none
when
he
called
again
and
again
he
staggered
weakly
to
his
feet
groping
for
matches
and
candles
a
panic
of
abject
terror
came
on
him
the
matches
were
gone
he
turned
towards
the
fireplace
a
single
coal
glowed
in
the
white
ashes
he
swept
a
mass
of
papers
and
dusty
books
from
the
table
and
with
trembling
hands
cowered
over
the
embers
until
he
succeeded
in
lighting
the
dry
tinder
then
he
piled
the
old
books
on
the
blaze
and
looked
fearfully
around
no
it
was
gone
thank
god
for
that
the
hook
was
empty
but
why
did
otto
sleep
so
soundly
why
did
he
not
awake
he
stepped
unsteadily
across
the
room
in
the
flaring
light
of
the
burning
books
and
knelt
by
the
mattress
so
they
found
him
in
the
morning
when
no
one
came
to
the
inn
from
kropfsberg
keep
and
the
quaking
peter
rosskopf
arranged
a
relief
party
found
him
kneeling
beside
the
mattress
where
otto
lay
shot
in
the
throat
and
quite
dead
the
white
villa
the
white
villa
when
we
left
naples
on
the
train
for
pæstum
tom
and
i
we
fully
intended
returning
by
the
not
because
two
hours
time
seemed
enough
wherein
to
exhaust
the
interests
of
those
deathless
ruins
of
a
dead
civilization
but
simply
for
the
reason
that
as
our
informed
us
there
was
but
one
other
train
and
that
at
which
would
land
us
in
naples
too
late
for
the
dinner
at
the
turners
and
the
san
carlo
afterwards
not
that
i
cared
in
the
least
for
the
dinner
or
the
theatre
but
then
i
was
not
so
obviously
in
miss
turner
good
graces
as
tom
rendel
was
which
made
a
difference
however
we
had
promised
so
that
was
an
end
of
it
this
was
in
the
spring
of
and
at
that
time
the
railroad
which
was
being
pushed
onward
to
reggio
whereby
travellers
to
sicily
might
be
spared
the
agonies
of
a
night
on
the
fickle
mediterranean
reached
no
farther
than
agropoli
some
twenty
miles
beyond
pæstum
but
although
the
trains
were
as
yet
few
and
slow
we
accepted
the
road
with
gratitude
for
it
penetrated
the
very
centre
of
campanian
brigandage
and
made
it
possible
for
us
to
see
the
matchless
temples
in
safety
while
a
few
years
before
it
was
necessary
for
intending
visitors
to
obtain
a
military
escort
from
the
government
and
military
escorts
are
not
for
young
architects
so
we
set
off
contentedly
that
white
may
morning
determined
to
make
the
best
of
our
few
hours
little
thinking
that
before
we
saw
naples
again
we
were
to
witness
things
that
perhaps
no
american
had
ever
seen
before
for
a
moment
when
we
left
the
train
at
pesto
and
started
to
walk
up
the
flowery
lane
leading
to
the
temples
we
were
almost
inclined
to
curse
this
same
railroad
we
had
thought
in
our
innocence
that
we
should
be
alone
that
no
one
else
would
think
of
enduring
the
long
four
hours
ride
from
naples
just
to
spend
two
hours
in
the
ruins
of
these
temples
but
the
event
proved
our
unwisdom
we
were
alone
it
was
a
compact
little
party
of
conventional
that
accompanied
us
the
inevitable
english
family
with
the
three
daughters
prominent
of
teeth
flowing
of
hair
aggressive
of
scarlet
murrays
and
baedekers
the
two
blond
and
untidy
germans
a
french
couple
from
the
pages
of
vie
and
our
old
man
of
the
sea
the
presbyterian
minister
from
pennsylvania
who
had
made
our
life
miserable
in
rome
at
the
time
of
the
pope
jubilee
fortunately
for
us
this
terrible
old
man
had
fastened
himself
upon
a
party
of
american
travelling
and
for
the
time
we
were
safe
but
our
vision
of
two
hours
of
dreamy
solitude
faded
lamentably
away
yet
how
beautiful
it
was
this
golden
meadow
walled
with
far
violet
mountains
breathless
under
a
may
sun
and
in
the
midst
rising
from
tangles
of
asphodel
and
acanthus
vast
in
the
vacant
plain
three
temples
one
silver
gray
one
golden
gray
and
one
flushed
with
intangible
rose
and
all
around
nothing
but
velvet
meadows
stretching
from
the
dim
mountains
behind
away
to
the
sea
that
showed
only
as
a
thin
line
of
silver
just
over
the
edge
of
the
still
grass
the
tide
of
tourists
swept
noisily
through
the
basilica
and
the
temple
of
poseidon
across
the
meadow
to
the
distant
temple
of
ceres
and
tom
and
i
were
left
alone
to
drink
in
all
the
fine
wine
of
dreams
that
was
possible
in
the
time
left
us
we
gave
but
little
space
to
examining
the
temples
the
tourists
had
left
but
in
a
few
moments
found
ourselves
lying
in
the
grass
to
the
east
of
poseidon
looking
dimly
out
towards
the
sea
heard
now
but
not
seen
a
vague
and
pulsating
murmur
that
blended
with
the
humming
of
bees
all
about
us
a
small
shepherd
boy
with
a
woolly
dog
made
shy
advances
of
friendship
and
in
a
little
time
we
had
set
him
to
gathering
flowers
for
us
asphodels
and
anemones
and
the
little
thin
green
iris
so
fairylike
and
frail
the
murmur
of
the
tourist
crowd
had
merged
itself
in
the
moan
of
the
sea
and
it
was
very
still
suddenly
i
heard
the
words
i
had
been
waiting
for
the
suggestion
i
had
refrained
from
making
myself
for
i
knew
thomas
i
say
old
man
shall
we
let
the
go
to
thunder
i
chuckled
to
myself
but
the
turners
they
be
blowed
we
can
tell
them
we
missed
the
train
that
is
just
exactly
what
we
shall
do
i
said
pulling
out
my
watch
unless
we
start
for
the
station
right
now
but
tom
drew
an
acanthus
leaf
across
his
face
and
showed
no
signs
of
moving
so
i
filled
my
pipe
again
and
we
missed
the
train
as
the
sun
dropped
lower
towards
the
sea
changing
its
silver
line
to
gold
we
pulled
ourselves
together
and
for
an
hour
or
more
sketched
vigorously
but
the
mood
was
not
on
us
it
was
too
jolly
fine
to
waste
time
working
as
tom
said
so
we
started
off
to
explore
the
single
street
of
the
squalid
town
of
pesto
that
was
lost
within
the
walls
of
dead
poseidonia
it
was
not
a
pretty
village
if
you
can
call
a
lane
and
a
dozen
houses
a
village
nor
were
the
inhabitants
thereof
reassuring
in
appearance
there
was
no
sign
of
a
church
nothing
but
dirty
huts
and
in
the
midst
one
of
two
stories
rejoicing
in
the
name
of
del
the
first
story
of
which
was
a
black
and
cavernous
smithy
where
certain
swarthy
knaves
looking
like
banditti
out
of
a
job
sat
smoking
sulkily
we
might
stay
here
all
night
said
tom
grinning
askance
at
this
choice
company
but
his
suggestion
was
not
received
with
enthusiasm
down
where
the
lane
from
the
station
joined
the
main
road
stood
the
only
sign
of
modern
civilization
a
great
square
structure
half
villa
half
fortress
with
round
turrets
on
its
four
corners
and
a
wall
surrounding
it
there
were
no
windows
in
its
first
story
so
far
as
we
could
see
and
it
had
evidently
been
at
one
time
the
fortified
villa
of
some
campanian
noble
now
however
whether
because
brigandage
had
been
stamped
out
or
because
the
villa
was
empty
and
deserted
it
was
no
longer
formidable
the
gates
of
the
great
wall
hung
sagging
on
their
hinges
brambles
growing
all
over
them
and
many
of
the
windows
in
the
upper
story
were
broken
and
black
it
was
a
strange
place
weird
and
mysterious
and
we
looked
at
it
curiously
there
is
a
story
about
that
place
said
tom
with
conviction
it
was
growing
late
the
sun
was
near
the
edge
of
the
sea
as
we
walked
down
the
walls
of
the
vanished
city
for
the
last
time
and
as
we
turned
back
a
red
flush
poured
from
the
west
and
painted
the
doric
temples
in
pallid
rose
against
the
evanescent
purple
of
the
apennines
already
a
thin
mist
was
rising
from
the
meadows
and
the
temples
hung
pink
in
the
misty
grayness
it
was
a
sorrow
to
leave
the
beautiful
things
but
we
could
run
no
risk
of
missing
this
last
train
so
we
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
temples
what
is
that
johnny
waving
his
arm
at
us
for
asked
tom
suddenly
how
should
i
know
we
are
not
on
his
land
and
the
walls
do
matter
we
pulled
out
our
watches
simultaneously
what
time
are
you
i
said
six
minutes
before
six
and
i
am
seven
minutes
it
ca
take
us
all
that
time
to
walk
to
the
station
are
you
sure
the
train
goes
at
dead
sure
i
answered
and
showed
him
the
by
this
time
a
woman
and
two
children
were
shrieking
at
us
hysterically
but
what
they
said
i
had
no
idea
their
italian
being
of
a
strange
and
awful
nature
look
here
i
said
let
run
perhaps
our
watches
are
both
slow
or
perhaps
the
is
changed
then
we
ran
and
the
populace
cheered
and
shouted
with
enthusiasm
our
dignified
run
became
a
rout
for
as
we
turned
into
the
lane
smoke
was
rising
from
beyond
the
bank
that
hid
the
railroad
a
bell
rang
we
were
so
near
that
we
could
hear
the
interrogative
the
impatient
and
the
definitive
but
the
train
was
five
hundred
yards
away
steaming
towards
naples
when
we
plunged
into
the
station
as
the
clock
struck
six
and
yelled
for
the
he
came
and
we
indulged
in
crimination
and
recrimination
when
we
could
regard
the
situation
calmly
it
became
apparent
that
the
been
changed
two
days
before
the
now
leaving
at
a
came
in
and
we
four
sat
down
and
regarded
the
situation
judicially
was
there
any
other
train
no
could
we
stay
at
the
albergo
del
sole
a
forefinger
drawn
across
the
throat
by
the
capo
stazione
with
a
significant
cluck
closed
that
question
then
we
must
stay
with
you
here
at
the
station
but
signori
i
am
not
married
i
live
here
only
with
the
i
have
only
one
room
to
sleep
in
it
is
impossible
but
we
must
sleep
somewhere
likewise
eat
what
can
we
do
and
we
shifted
the
responsibility
deftly
on
the
shoulders
of
the
poor
old
man
who
was
growing
excited
again
he
trotted
nervously
up
and
down
the
station
for
a
minute
then
he
called
the
giuseppe
go
up
to
the
villa
and
ask
if
two
who
have
missed
the
last
train
can
stay
there
all
night
protests
were
useless
the
was
gone
and
we
waited
anxiously
for
his
return
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
never
come
darkness
had
fallen
and
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
mountains
at
last
he
appeared
the
signori
may
stay
all
night
and
welcome
but
they
can
not
come
to
dinner
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
house
to
eat
this
was
not
reassuring
and
again
the
old
lost
himself
in
meditation
the
results
were
admirable
for
in
a
little
time
the
table
in
the
had
been
transformed
into
a
and
tom
and
i
were
ravenously
devouring
a
big
omelette
and
bread
and
cheese
and
drinking
a
most
shocking
sour
wine
as
though
it
were
château
yquem
a
served
us
with
clumsy
and
when
we
had
induced
our
nervous
old
host
to
sit
down
with
us
and
partake
of
his
own
hospitality
we
succeeded
in
forming
a
passably
jolly
forgetting
over
our
sour
wine
and
cigarettes
the
coming
hours
from
ten
until
sunrise
which
lay
before
us
in
a
dubious
mist
it
was
with
crowding
apprehensions
which
we
strove
in
vain
to
joke
away
that
we
set
out
at
last
to
retrace
our
steps
to
the
mysterious
villa
the
giuseppe
leading
the
way
by
this
time
the
moon
was
well
overhead
and
just
behind
us
as
we
tramped
up
the
dewy
lane
white
in
the
moonlight
between
the
hedgerows
on
either
side
how
still
it
was
not
a
breath
of
air
not
a
sound
of
life
only
the
awful
silence
that
had
lain
almost
unbroken
for
two
thousand
years
over
this
vast
graveyard
of
a
dead
world
as
we
passed
between
the
shattered
gates
and
wound
our
way
in
the
moonlight
through
the
maze
of
gnarled
decaying
farm
implements
and
piles
of
lumber
towards
the
small
door
that
formed
the
only
opening
in
the
first
story
of
this
deserted
fortress
the
cold
silence
was
shattered
by
the
harsh
baying
of
dogs
somewhere
in
the
distance
to
the
right
beyond
the
barns
that
formed
one
side
of
the
court
from
the
villa
came
neither
light
nor
sound
giuseppe
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
sound
echoed
cavernously
within
but
there
was
no
other
reply
he
knocked
again
and
again
and
at
length
we
heard
the
rasping
jar
of
sliding
bolts
and
the
door
opened
a
little
showing
an
old
old
man
bent
with
age
and
gaunt
with
malaria
over
his
head
he
held
a
big
roman
lamp
with
three
wicks
that
cast
strange
shadows
on
his
face
a
face
that
was
harmless
in
its
senility
but
intolerably
sad
he
made
no
reply
to
our
timid
salutations
but
motioned
tremblingly
to
us
to
enter
and
with
a
last
to
giuseppe
we
obeyed
and
stood
up
the
stone
stairs
that
led
directly
from
the
door
while
the
old
man
tediously
shot
every
bolt
and
adjusted
the
heavy
bar
then
we
followed
him
in
the
up
the
steps
into
what
had
been
the
great
hall
of
the
villa
a
fire
was
burning
in
a
great
fireplace
so
beautiful
in
design
that
tom
and
i
looked
at
each
other
with
interest
by
its
fitful
light
we
could
see
that
we
were
in
a
huge
circular
room
covered
by
a
flat
dome
a
room
that
must
once
have
been
superb
and
splendid
but
that
now
was
a
lamentable
wreck
the
frescoes
on
the
dome
were
stained
and
mildewed
and
here
and
there
the
plaster
was
gone
altogether
the
carved
doorways
that
led
out
on
all
sides
had
lost
half
the
gold
with
which
they
had
once
been
covered
and
the
floor
was
of
brick
sunken
into
treacherous
valleys
rough
chests
piles
of
old
newspapers
fragments
of
harnesses
farm
implements
a
heap
of
rusty
carbines
and
cutlasses
nameless
litter
of
every
possible
kind
made
the
room
into
a
wilderness
which
under
the
firelight
seemed
even
more
picturesque
than
it
really
was
and
on
this
inexpressible
confusion
of
lumber
the
pale
shapes
of
the
nymphs
startling
in
their
nudity
looked
down
with
vacant
smiles
for
a
few
moments
we
warmed
ourselves
before
the
fire
and
then
in
the
same
dejected
silence
the
old
man
led
the
way
to
one
of
the
many
doors
handed
us
a
brass
lamp
and
with
a
stiff
bow
turned
his
back
on
us
once
in
our
room
alone
tom
and
i
looked
at
each
other
with
faces
that
expressed
the
most
complex
emotions
well
of
all
the
rum
goes
said
tom
this
is
the
rummiest
go
i
ever
experienced
right
my
boy
as
you
very
justly
remark
we
are
in
for
it
help
me
shut
this
door
and
then
we
will
reconnoitre
take
account
of
stock
and
size
up
our
chances
but
the
door
showed
no
sign
of
closing
it
grated
on
the
brick
floor
and
stuck
in
the
warped
casing
and
it
took
our
united
efforts
to
jam
the
two
inches
of
oak
into
its
place
and
turn
the
enormous
old
key
in
its
rusty
lock
better
now
much
better
now
said
tom
now
let
us
see
where
we
are
the
room
was
easily
feet
square
and
high
in
proportion
evidently
it
had
been
a
state
apartment
for
the
walls
were
covered
with
carved
panelling
that
had
once
been
white
and
gold
with
mirrors
in
the
panels
the
wood
now
stained
every
imaginable
color
the
mirrors
cracked
and
broken
and
dull
with
mildew
a
big
fire
had
just
been
lighted
in
the
fireplace
the
shutters
were
closed
and
although
the
only
furniture
consisted
of
two
massive
bedsteads
and
a
chair
with
one
leg
shorter
than
the
others
the
room
seemed
almost
comfortable
i
opened
one
of
the
shutters
that
closed
the
great
windows
that
ran
from
the
floor
almost
to
the
ceiling
and
nearly
fell
through
the
cracked
glass
into
the
floorless
balcony
tom
come
here
quick
i
cried
and
for
a
few
minutes
neither
of
us
thought
about
our
dubious
surroundings
for
we
were
looking
at
pæstum
by
moonlight
a
flat
white
mist
like
water
lay
over
the
entire
meadow
from
the
midst
rose
against
the
sky
the
three
ghostly
temples
black
and
silver
in
the
vivid
moonlight
floating
it
seemed
in
the
fog
and
behind
them
seen
in
broken
glints
between
the
pallid
shafts
stretched
the
line
of
the
silver
sea
perfect
silence
the
silence
of
implacable
death
we
watched
the
white
tide
of
mist
rise
around
the
temples
until
we
were
chilled
through
and
so
presently
went
to
bed
there
was
but
one
door
in
the
room
and
that
was
securely
locked
the
great
windows
were
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
so
we
felt
reasonably
safe
from
all
possible
attack
in
a
few
minutes
tom
was
asleep
and
breathing
audibly
but
my
constitution
is
more
nervous
than
his
and
i
lay
awake
for
some
little
time
thinking
of
our
curious
adventure
and
of
its
possible
outcome
finally
i
fell
asleep
for
how
long
i
do
not
know
but
i
woke
with
the
feeling
that
some
one
had
tried
the
handle
of
the
door
the
fire
had
fallen
into
a
heap
of
coals
which
cast
a
red
glow
in
the
room
whereby
i
could
see
dimly
the
outline
of
tom
bed
the
chair
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
the
door
in
its
deep
casing
by
the
chimney
directly
in
front
of
my
bed
i
sat
up
nervous
from
my
sudden
awakening
under
these
strange
circumstances
and
stared
at
the
door
the
latch
rattled
and
the
door
swung
smoothly
open
i
began
to
shiver
coldly
that
door
was
locked
tom
and
i
had
all
we
could
do
to
jam
it
together
and
lock
it
but
we
lock
it
and
now
it
was
opening
silently
in
a
minute
more
it
as
silently
closed
then
i
heard
a
footstep
i
swear
i
heard
a
footstep
the
and
with
it
the
of
trailing
skirts
my
breath
stopped
and
my
teeth
grated
against
each
other
as
i
heard
the
soft
footfalls
and
the
feminine
rustle
pass
along
the
room
towards
the
fireplace
my
eyes
saw
nothing
yet
there
was
enough
light
in
the
room
for
me
to
distinguish
the
pattern
on
the
carved
panels
of
the
door
the
steps
stopped
by
the
fire
and
i
saw
the
chair
lean
to
the
left
with
a
little
jar
as
its
short
leg
touched
the
floor
i
sat
still
frozen
motionless
staring
at
the
vacancy
that
was
filled
with
such
terror
for
me
and
as
i
looked
the
seat
of
the
chair
creaked
and
it
came
back
to
its
upright
position
again
and
then
the
footsteps
came
down
the
room
lightly
towards
the
window
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
great
shutters
swung
back
and
the
white
moonlight
poured
in
its
brilliancy
was
unbroken
by
any
shadow
by
any
sign
of
material
substance
i
tried
to
cry
out
to
make
some
sound
to
awaken
tom
this
sense
of
utter
loneliness
in
the
presence
of
the
inexplicable
was
maddening
i
do
know
whether
my
lips
obeyed
my
will
or
no
at
all
events
tom
lay
motionless
with
his
deaf
ear
up
and
gave
no
sign
the
shutters
closed
as
silently
as
they
had
opened
the
moonlight
was
gone
the
firelight
also
and
in
utter
darkness
i
waited
if
i
could
only
if
something
were
visible
i
should
not
mind
it
so
much
but
this
ghastly
hearing
of
every
little
sound
every
rustle
of
a
gown
every
breath
yet
seeing
nothing
was
i
think
in
my
abject
terror
i
prayed
that
i
might
see
only
see
but
the
darkness
was
unbroken
then
the
footsteps
began
to
waver
fitfully
and
i
heard
the
rustle
of
garments
sliding
to
the
floor
the
clatter
of
little
shoes
flung
down
the
rattle
of
buttons
and
of
metal
against
wood
rigors
shot
over
me
and
my
whole
body
shivered
with
collapse
as
i
sank
back
on
the
pillow
waiting
with
every
nerve
tense
listening
with
all
my
life
the
coverlid
was
turned
back
beside
me
and
in
another
moment
the
great
bed
sank
a
little
as
something
slipped
between
the
sheets
with
an
audible
sigh
i
called
to
my
aid
every
atom
of
remaining
strength
and
with
a
cry
that
shivered
between
my
clattering
teeth
i
hurled
myself
headlong
from
the
bed
on
to
the
floor
i
must
have
lain
for
some
time
stunned
and
unconscious
for
when
i
finally
came
to
myself
it
was
cold
in
the
room
there
was
no
last
glow
of
lingering
coals
in
the
fireplace
and
i
was
stiff
with
chill
it
all
flashed
over
me
like
the
haunting
of
a
heavy
dream
i
laughed
a
little
at
the
dim
memory
with
the
thought
i
must
try
to
recollect
all
the
details
they
will
do
to
tell
tom
and
rose
stiffly
to
return
to
bed
when
there
it
was
again
and
my
heart
stopped
the
hand
on
the
door
i
paused
and
listened
the
door
opened
with
a
muffled
creak
closed
again
and
i
heard
the
lock
turn
rustily
i
would
have
died
now
before
getting
into
that
bed
again
but
there
was
terror
equally
without
so
i
stood
trembling
and
listened
listened
to
heavy
stealthy
steps
creeping
along
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
i
clutched
the
coverlid
staring
across
into
the
dark
there
was
a
rush
in
the
air
by
my
face
the
sound
of
a
blow
and
simultaneously
a
shriek
so
awful
so
despairing
so
that
i
felt
my
senses
leaving
me
again
as
i
sank
crouching
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
and
then
began
the
awful
duel
the
duel
of
invisible
audible
shapes
of
things
that
shrieked
and
raved
mingling
thin
feminine
cries
with
low
stifled
curses
and
indistinguishable
words
round
and
round
the
room
footsteps
chasing
footsteps
in
the
ghastly
night
now
away
by
tom
bed
now
rushing
swiftly
down
the
great
room
until
i
felt
the
flash
of
swirling
drapery
on
my
hard
lips
round
and
round
turning
and
twisting
till
my
brain
whirled
with
the
mad
cries
they
were
coming
nearer
i
felt
the
jar
of
their
feet
on
the
floor
beside
me
came
one
long
gurgling
moan
close
over
my
head
and
then
crushing
down
upon
me
the
weight
of
a
collapsing
body
there
was
long
hair
over
my
face
and
in
my
staring
eyes
and
as
awful
silence
succeeded
the
less
awful
tumult
life
went
out
and
i
fell
unfathomable
miles
into
nothingness
the
gray
dawn
was
sifting
through
the
chinks
in
the
shutters
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
i
lay
stunned
and
faint
staring
up
at
the
mouldy
frescoes
on
the
ceiling
struggling
to
gather
together
my
wandering
senses
and
knit
them
into
something
like
consciousness
but
now
as
i
pulled
myself
little
by
little
together
there
was
no
thought
of
dreams
before
me
one
after
another
the
awful
incidents
of
that
unspeakable
night
came
back
and
i
lay
incapable
of
movement
of
action
trying
to
piece
together
the
whirling
fragments
of
memory
that
circled
dizzily
around
me
little
by
little
it
grew
lighter
in
the
room
i
could
see
the
pallid
lines
struggling
through
the
shutters
behind
me
grow
stronger
along
the
broken
and
dusty
floor
the
tarnished
mirrors
reflected
dirtily
the
growing
daylight
a
door
closed
far
away
and
i
heard
the
crowing
of
a
cock
then
by
and
by
the
whistle
of
a
passing
train
years
seemed
to
have
passed
since
i
first
came
into
this
terrible
room
i
had
lost
the
use
of
my
tongue
my
voice
refused
to
obey
my
desire
to
cry
out
once
or
twice
i
tried
in
vain
to
force
an
articulate
sound
through
my
rigid
lips
and
when
at
last
a
broken
whisper
rewarded
my
feverish
struggles
i
felt
a
strange
sense
of
great
victory
how
soundly
he
slept
ordinarily
rousing
him
was
no
easy
task
and
now
he
revolted
steadily
against
being
awakened
at
this
untimely
hour
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
called
him
for
ages
almost
before
i
heard
him
grunt
sleepily
and
turn
in
bed
tom
i
cried
weakly
tom
come
and
help
me
what
do
you
want
what
is
the
matter
with
you
do
ask
come
and
help
me
fallen
out
of
bed
i
guess
and
he
laughed
drowsily
my
abject
terror
lest
he
should
go
to
sleep
again
gave
me
new
strength
was
it
the
actual
physical
paralysis
born
of
killing
fear
that
held
me
down
i
could
not
have
raised
my
head
from
the
floor
on
my
life
i
could
only
cry
out
in
deadly
fear
for
tom
to
come
and
help
me
why
do
you
get
up
and
get
into
bed
he
answered
when
i
implored
him
to
come
to
me
you
have
got
a
bad
nightmare
wake
up
but
something
in
my
voice
roused
him
at
last
and
he
came
chuckling
across
the
room
stopping
to
throw
open
two
of
the
great
shutters
and
let
a
burst
of
white
light
into
the
room
he
climbed
up
on
the
bed
and
peered
over
jeeringly
with
the
first
glance
the
laugh
died
and
he
leaped
the
bed
and
bent
over
me
my
god
man
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
hurt
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
lift
me
up
get
me
away
from
here
and
i
tell
you
all
i
know
but
old
chap
you
must
be
hurt
awfully
the
floor
is
covered
with
blood
he
lifted
my
head
and
held
me
in
his
powerful
arms
i
looked
down
a
great
red
stain
blotted
the
floor
beside
me
but
apart
from
the
black
bruise
on
my
head
there
was
no
sign
of
a
wound
on
my
body
nor
stain
of
blood
on
my
lips
in
as
few
words
as
possible
i
told
him
the
whole
story
let
get
out
of
this
he
said
when
i
had
finished
this
is
no
place
for
us
brigands
i
can
stand
but
he
helped
me
to
dress
and
as
soon
as
possible
we
forced
open
the
heavy
door
the
door
i
had
seen
turn
so
softly
on
its
hinges
only
a
few
hours
before
and
came
out
into
the
great
circular
hall
no
less
strange
and
mysterious
now
in
the
half
light
of
dawn
than
it
had
been
by
firelight
the
room
was
empty
for
it
must
have
been
very
early
although
a
fire
already
blazed
in
the
fireplace
we
sat
by
the
fire
some
time
seeing
no
one
presently
slow
footsteps
sounded
in
the
stairway
and
the
old
man
entered
silent
as
the
night
before
nodding
to
us
civilly
but
showing
by
no
sign
any
surprise
which
he
may
have
felt
at
our
early
rising
in
absolute
silence
he
moved
around
preparing
coffee
for
us
and
when
at
last
the
frugal
breakfast
was
ready
and
we
sat
around
the
rough
table
munching
coarse
bread
and
sipping
the
black
coffee
he
would
reply
to
our
overtures
only
by
monosyllables
any
attempt
at
drawing
from
him
some
facts
as
to
the
history
of
the
villa
was
received
with
a
grave
and
frigid
repellence
that
baffled
us
and
we
were
forced
to
say
with
our
hunger
for
some
explanation
of
the
events
of
the
night
still
unsatisfied
but
we
saw
the
temples
by
sunrise
when
the
mistlike
lambent
opals
bathed
the
bases
of
the
tall
columns
salmon
in
the
morning
light
it
was
a
rhapsody
in
the
pale
and
unearthly
colors
of
puvis
de
chavannes
vitalized
and
made
glorious
with
splendid
sunlight
the
apotheosis
of
mist
a
vision
never
before
seen
never
to
be
forgotten
it
was
so
beautiful
that
the
memory
of
my
ghastly
night
paled
and
faded
and
it
was
tom
who
assailed
the
with
questions
while
we
waited
for
the
train
from
agropoli
luckily
he
was
more
than
loquacious
he
was
voluble
under
the
ameliorating
influence
of
the
money
we
forced
upon
him
and
this
in
few
words
was
the
story
he
told
us
while
we
sat
on
the
platform
smoking
marvelling
at
the
mists
that
rose
to
the
east
now
veiling
now
revealing
the
lavender
apennines
is
there
a
story
of
villa
ah
signori
certainly
and
a
story
very
strange
and
very
terrible
it
was
much
time
ago
a
hundred
two
hundred
years
i
do
not
know
well
the
duca
di
san
damiano
married
a
lady
so
fair
so
most
beautiful
that
she
was
called
luna
di
but
she
was
of
the
people
more
she
was
of
the
banditti
her
father
was
of
calabria
and
a
terror
of
the
campagna
but
the
duke
was
young
and
he
married
her
and
for
her
built
the
white
villa
and
it
was
a
wonder
throughout
campania
you
have
seen
it
is
splendid
now
even
if
a
ruin
well
it
was
less
than
a
year
after
they
came
to
the
villa
before
the
duke
grew
jealous
jealous
of
the
new
captain
of
the
banditti
who
took
the
place
of
the
father
of
himself
killed
in
a
great
battle
up
there
in
the
mountains
was
there
cause
who
shall
know
but
there
were
stories
among
the
people
of
terrible
things
in
the
villa
and
how
was
seen
almost
never
outside
the
walls
then
the
duke
would
go
for
many
days
to
napoli
coming
home
only
now
and
then
to
the
villa
that
was
become
a
fortress
so
many
men
guarded
its
gates
and
once
it
was
in
the
spring
the
duke
came
silently
down
from
napoli
and
there
by
the
three
poplars
you
see
away
towards
the
north
his
carriage
was
set
upon
by
armed
men
and
he
was
almost
killed
but
he
had
with
him
many
guards
and
after
a
terrible
fight
the
brigands
were
beaten
off
but
before
him
wounded
lay
the
captain
the
man
whom
he
feared
and
hated
he
looked
at
him
lying
there
under
the
torchlight
and
in
his
hand
saw
own
then
he
became
a
devil
with
the
same
sword
he
ran
the
brigand
through
leaped
in
the
carriage
and
entering
the
villa
crept
to
the
chamber
of
and
killed
her
with
the
sword
she
had
given
to
her
lover
this
is
all
the
story
of
the
white
villa
except
that
the
duke
came
never
again
to
pesto
he
went
back
to
the
king
at
napoli
and
for
many
years
he
was
the
scourge
of
the
banditti
of
campania
for
the
king
made
him
a
general
and
san
damiano
was
a
name
feared
by
the
lawless
and
loved
by
the
peaceful
until
he
was
killed
in
a
battle
down
by
mormanno
and
some
say
she
comes
back
to
the
villa
once
a
year
when
the
moon
is
full
in
the
month
when
she
was
slain
for
the
duke
buried
her
they
say
with
his
own
hands
in
the
garden
that
was
once
under
the
window
of
her
chamber
and
as
she
died
unshriven
so
was
she
buried
without
the
pale
of
the
church
therefore
she
can
not
sleep
in
peace
è
i
do
not
know
if
the
story
is
true
but
this
is
the
story
signori
and
there
is
the
train
for
napoli
grazie
signori
grazie
tanto
a
rivederci
signori
a
rivederci
sister
maddelena
sister
maddelena
across
the
valley
of
the
oreto
from
monreale
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
just
above
the
little
village
of
parco
lies
the
old
convent
of
sta
catarina
from
the
cloister
terrace
at
monreale
you
can
see
its
pale
walls
and
the
slim
campanile
of
its
chapel
rising
from
the
crowded
citron
and
mulberry
orchards
that
flourish
rank
and
wild
no
longer
cared
for
by
pious
and
loving
hands
from
the
rough
road
that
climbs
the
mountains
to
assunto
the
convent
is
invisible
a
gnarled
and
ragged
olive
grove
intervening
and
a
spur
of
cliffs
as
well
while
from
palermo
one
sees
only
the
speck
of
white
flashing
in
the
sun
indistinguishable
from
the
many
similar
gleams
of
desert
monastery
or
pauper
village
partly
because
of
this
seclusion
partly
by
reason
of
its
extreme
beauty
partly
it
may
be
because
the
present
owners
are
more
than
charming
and
gracious
in
their
pressing
hospitality
sta
catarina
seems
to
preserve
an
element
of
the
poetic
almost
magical
and
as
i
drove
with
the
cavaliere
valguanera
one
evening
in
march
out
of
palermo
along
the
garden
valley
of
the
oreto
then
up
the
mountain
side
where
the
warm
light
of
the
spring
sunset
swept
across
from
monreale
lying
golden
and
mellow
on
the
luxuriant
growth
of
figs
and
olives
and
and
fantastic
cacti
and
so
up
to
where
the
path
of
the
convent
swung
off
to
the
right
round
a
dizzy
point
of
cliff
that
reached
out
gaunt
and
gray
from
the
olives
below
as
i
drove
thus
in
the
balmy
air
and
saw
of
a
sudden
a
vision
of
creamy
walls
and
orange
roofs
draped
in
fantastic
festoons
of
roses
with
a
single
curving
stuck
black
and
feathery
against
the
gold
sunset
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
i
should
slip
into
a
mood
of
visionary
enjoyment
looking
for
a
time
on
the
whole
thing
as
the
misty
phantasm
of
a
summer
dream
the
cavaliere
had
introduced
himself
to
us
tom
rendel
and
me
one
morning
soon
after
we
reached
palermo
when
in
the
first
bewilderment
of
architects
in
this
paradise
of
art
and
color
we
were
working
nobly
at
our
sketches
in
that
dream
of
delight
the
capella
palatina
he
was
himself
an
amateur
archæologist
he
told
us
and
passionately
devoted
to
his
island
so
he
felt
impelled
to
speak
to
any
one
whom
he
saw
appreciating
the
almost
and
in
a
way
fortunately
unknown
beauties
of
palermo
in
a
little
time
we
were
fully
acquainted
and
talking
like
the
oldest
friends
of
course
he
knew
acquaintances
of
rendel
some
one
always
does
this
time
they
were
officers
on
the
tubby
quinebaug
that
during
the
summer
of
was
trying
to
uphold
the
maritime
honor
of
the
united
states
in
european
waters
luckily
for
us
one
of
the
officers
was
a
kind
of
cousin
of
rendel
and
came
from
baltimore
as
well
so
as
he
had
visited
at
the
cavaliere
place
we
were
soon
invited
to
do
the
same
it
was
in
this
way
that
with
the
luck
that
attends
rendel
wherever
he
goes
we
came
to
see
something
of
domestic
life
in
italy
and
that
i
found
myself
involved
in
another
of
those
adventures
for
which
i
naturally
sought
so
little
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
other
place
in
sicily
so
faultless
as
sta
catarina
taormina
is
a
paradise
an
epitome
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
italy
venice
excepted
girgenti
is
a
solemn
epic
with
its
golden
temples
between
the
sea
and
hills
cefalù
is
wild
and
strange
and
monreale
a
vision
out
of
a
fairy
tale
but
sta
catarina
fancy
a
convent
of
creamy
stone
and
brick
perched
on
a
ledge
of
rock
midway
between
earth
and
heaven
the
cliff
falling
almost
sheer
to
the
valley
two
hundred
feet
and
more
the
mountain
rising
behind
straight
towards
the
sky
all
the
rocks
covered
with
cactus
and
dwarf
the
convent
draped
in
smothering
roses
and
in
front
a
terrace
with
a
fountain
in
the
midst
and
then
nothing
between
you
and
the
sapphire
sea
six
miles
away
below
stretches
the
eden
valley
the
concha
fig
orchards
alternating
with
olives
the
mountains
rising
on
either
hand
and
sinking
undulously
away
towards
the
bay
where
like
a
magic
city
of
ivory
and
nacre
palermo
lies
guarded
by
the
twin
mountains
monte
pellegrino
and
capo
zafferano
arid
rocks
like
dull
amethysts
rose
in
sunlight
violet
in
shadow
lions
couchant
guarding
the
sleeping
town
seen
as
we
saw
it
for
the
first
time
that
hot
evening
in
march
with
the
golden
lambent
light
pouring
down
through
the
valley
making
it
in
verity
a
shell
of
gold
sitting
in
indian
chairs
on
the
terrace
with
the
perfume
of
roses
and
jasmines
all
around
us
the
valley
of
the
oreto
palermo
sta
catarina
monreale
all
were
but
parts
of
a
dreamy
vision
like
the
heavenly
city
of
sir
percivale
to
attain
which
he
passed
across
the
golden
bridge
that
burned
after
him
as
he
vanished
in
the
intolerable
light
of
the
beatific
vision
it
was
all
so
unreal
so
phantasmal
that
i
was
not
surprised
in
the
least
when
late
in
the
evening
after
the
ladies
had
gone
to
their
rooms
and
the
cavaliere
tom
and
i
were
stretched
out
in
chairs
on
the
terrace
smoking
lazily
under
the
multitudinous
stars
the
cavaliere
said
there
is
something
i
really
must
tell
you
both
before
you
go
to
bed
so
that
you
may
be
spared
any
unnecessary
alarm
you
are
going
to
say
that
the
place
is
haunted
said
rendel
feeling
vaguely
on
the
floor
beside
him
for
his
glass
of
amaro
thank
you
it
is
all
it
needs
the
cavaliere
smiled
a
little
yes
that
is
just
it
sta
catarina
is
really
haunted
and
much
as
my
reason
revolts
against
the
idea
as
superstitious
and
savoring
of
priestcraft
yet
i
must
acknowledge
i
see
no
way
of
avoiding
the
admission
i
do
not
presume
to
offer
any
explanations
i
only
state
the
fact
and
the
fact
is
that
one
or
other
of
you
will
in
all
human
or
unhuman
probability
receive
a
visit
from
sister
maddelena
you
need
not
be
in
the
least
afraid
the
apparition
is
perfectly
gentle
and
harmless
and
moreover
having
seen
it
once
you
will
never
see
it
again
no
one
sees
the
ghost
or
whatever
it
is
but
once
and
that
usually
the
first
night
he
spends
in
the
house
i
myself
saw
the
thing
eight
nine
years
ago
when
i
first
bought
the
place
from
the
marchese
di
muxaro
all
my
people
have
seen
it
nearly
all
my
guests
so
i
think
you
may
as
well
be
prepared
then
tell
us
what
to
expect
i
said
what
kind
of
a
ghost
is
this
nocturnal
visitor
it
is
simple
enough
some
time
you
will
suddenly
awake
and
see
before
you
a
carmelite
nun
who
will
look
fixedly
at
you
say
distinctly
and
very
sadly
can
not
sleep
and
then
vanish
that
is
all
it
is
hardly
worth
speaking
of
only
some
people
are
terribly
frightened
if
they
are
visited
unwarned
by
strange
apparitions
so
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
be
prepared
this
was
a
carmelite
convent
then
i
said
yes
it
was
suppressed
after
the
unification
of
italy
and
given
to
the
house
of
muxaro
but
the
family
died
out
and
i
bought
it
there
is
a
story
about
the
ghostly
nun
who
was
only
a
novice
and
even
that
unwillingly
which
gives
an
interest
to
an
otherwise
very
commonplace
and
uninteresting
ghost
i
beg
that
you
will
tell
it
us
cried
rendel
there
is
a
storm
coming
i
added
see
the
lightning
is
flashing
already
up
among
the
mountains
at
the
head
of
the
valley
if
the
story
is
tragic
as
it
must
be
now
is
just
the
time
for
it
you
will
tell
it
will
you
not
the
cavaliere
smiled
that
slow
cryptic
smile
of
his
that
was
so
unfathomable
as
you
say
there
is
a
shower
coming
and
as
we
have
fierce
tempests
here
we
might
not
sleep
so
perhaps
we
may
as
well
sit
up
a
little
longer
and
i
will
tell
you
the
story
the
air
was
utterly
still
hot
and
oppressive
the
rich
sick
odor
of
the
oranges
just
bursting
into
bloom
came
up
from
the
valley
in
a
gently
rising
tide
the
sky
thick
with
stars
seemed
mirrored
in
the
rich
foliage
below
so
numerous
were
the
under
the
still
trees
and
the
fireflies
that
gleamed
in
the
hot
air
lightning
flashed
fitfully
from
the
darkening
west
but
as
yet
no
thunder
broke
the
heavy
silence
the
cavaliere
lighted
another
cigar
and
pulled
a
cushion
under
his
head
so
that
he
could
look
down
to
the
distant
lights
of
the
city
this
is
the
story
he
said
once
upon
a
time
late
in
the
last
century
the
duca
di
castiglione
was
attached
to
the
court
of
charles
king
of
the
two
sicilies
down
at
palermo
they
tell
me
he
was
very
ambitious
and
not
content
with
marrying
his
son
to
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
house
of
tuscany
had
betrothed
his
only
daughter
rosalia
to
prince
antonio
a
cousin
of
the
king
his
whole
life
was
wrapped
up
in
the
fame
of
his
family
and
he
quite
forgot
all
domestic
affection
in
his
madness
for
dynastic
glory
his
son
was
a
worthy
scion
cold
and
proud
but
rosalia
was
according
to
legend
utterly
the
reverse
a
passionate
beautiful
girl
wilful
and
headstrong
and
careless
of
her
family
and
the
world
the
time
had
nearly
come
for
her
to
marry
prince
antonio
a
typical
of
the
spanish
court
when
through
the
treachery
of
a
servant
the
duke
discovered
that
his
daughter
was
in
love
with
a
young
military
officer
whose
name
i
do
remember
and
that
an
elopement
had
been
planned
to
take
place
the
next
night
the
fury
and
dismay
of
the
old
autocrat
passed
belief
he
saw
in
a
flash
the
downfall
of
all
his
hopes
of
family
aggrandizement
through
union
with
the
royal
house
and
knowing
well
the
spirit
of
his
daughter
despaired
of
ever
bringing
her
to
subjection
nevertheless
he
attacked
her
unmercifully
and
by
bullying
and
threats
by
imprisonment
and
even
bodily
chastisement
he
tried
to
break
her
spirit
and
bend
her
to
his
indomitable
will
through
his
power
at
court
he
had
the
lover
sent
away
to
the
mainland
and
for
more
than
a
year
he
held
his
daughter
closely
imprisoned
in
his
palace
on
the
toledo
that
one
you
may
remember
on
the
right
just
beyond
the
via
del
collegio
dei
gesuiti
with
the
beautiful
grilles
at
all
the
windows
and
the
painted
frieze
but
nothing
could
move
her
nothing
bend
her
stubborn
will
and
at
last
furious
at
the
girl
he
could
not
govern
castiglione
sent
her
to
this
convent
then
one
of
the
few
houses
of
barefoot
carmelite
nuns
in
italy
he
stipulated
that
she
should
take
the
name
of
maddelena
that
he
should
never
hear
of
her
again
and
that
she
should
be
held
an
absolute
prisoner
in
this
conventual
castle
rosalia
or
sister
maddelena
as
she
was
now
believed
her
lover
dead
for
her
father
had
given
her
good
proofs
of
this
and
she
believed
him
nevertheless
she
refused
to
marry
another
and
seized
upon
the
convent
life
as
a
blessed
relief
from
the
tyranny
of
her
maniacal
father
she
lived
here
for
four
or
five
years
her
name
was
forgotten
at
court
and
in
her
father
palace
rosalia
di
castiglione
was
dead
and
only
sister
maddelena
lived
a
carmelite
nun
in
her
place
in
ferdinand
iv
found
himself
driven
from
his
throne
on
the
mainland
his
kingdom
divided
and
he
himself
forced
to
flee
to
sicily
with
him
came
the
lover
of
the
dead
rosalia
now
high
in
military
honor
he
on
his
part
had
thought
rosalia
dead
and
it
was
only
by
accident
that
he
found
that
she
still
lived
a
carmelite
nun
then
began
the
second
act
of
the
romance
that
until
then
had
been
only
sadly
commonplace
but
now
became
dark
and
tragic
michele
michele
biscari
that
was
his
name
i
remember
now
haunted
the
region
of
the
convent
striving
to
communicate
with
sister
maddelena
and
at
last
from
the
cliffs
over
us
up
there
among
the
citrons
you
will
see
by
the
next
flash
of
lightning
he
saw
her
in
the
great
cloister
recognized
her
in
her
white
habit
found
her
the
same
dark
and
splendid
beauty
of
six
years
before
only
made
more
beautiful
by
her
white
habit
and
her
rigid
life
by
and
by
he
found
a
day
when
she
was
alone
and
tossed
a
ring
to
her
as
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
cloister
she
looked
up
saw
him
and
from
that
moment
lived
only
to
love
him
in
life
as
she
had
loved
his
memory
in
the
death
she
had
thought
had
overtaken
him
with
the
utmost
craft
they
arranged
their
plans
together
they
could
not
speak
for
a
word
would
have
aroused
the
other
inmates
of
the
convent
they
could
make
signs
only
when
sister
maddelena
was
alone
michele
could
throw
notes
to
her
from
the
cliff
a
feat
demanding
a
strong
arm
as
you
will
see
if
you
measure
the
distance
with
your
eye
and
she
could
drop
replies
from
the
window
over
the
cliff
which
he
picked
up
at
the
bottom
finally
he
succeeded
in
casting
into
the
cloister
a
coil
of
light
rope
the
girl
fastened
it
to
the
bars
of
one
of
the
windows
and
so
great
is
the
madness
of
love
biscari
actually
climbed
the
rope
from
the
valley
to
the
window
of
the
cell
a
distance
of
almost
two
hundred
feet
with
but
three
little
craggy
in
all
that
height
for
nearly
a
month
these
nocturnal
visits
were
undiscovered
and
michele
had
almost
completed
his
arrangements
for
carrying
the
girl
from
sta
catarina
and
away
to
spain
when
unfortunately
one
of
the
sisters
suspecting
some
mystery
from
the
changed
face
of
sister
maddelena
began
investigating
and
at
length
discovered
the
rope
neatly
coiled
up
by
the
nun
window
and
hidden
under
some
clinging
vines
she
instantly
told
the
mother
superior
and
together
they
watched
from
a
window
in
the
crypt
of
the
chapel
the
only
place
as
you
will
see
from
which
one
could
see
the
window
of
sister
maddelena
cell
they
saw
the
figure
of
michele
daringly
ascending
the
slim
rope
watched
hour
after
hour
the
sister
remaining
while
the
superior
went
to
say
the
hours
in
the
chapel
at
each
of
which
sister
maddelena
was
present
and
at
last
at
prime
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
they
saw
the
figure
slip
down
the
rope
watched
the
rope
drawn
up
and
concealed
and
knew
that
sister
maddelena
was
in
their
hands
for
vengeance
and
punishment
a
criminal
the
next
day
by
the
order
of
the
mother
superior
sister
maddelena
was
imprisoned
in
one
of
the
cells
under
the
chapel
charged
with
her
guilt
and
commanded
to
make
full
and
complete
confession
but
not
a
word
would
she
say
although
they
offered
her
forgiveness
if
she
would
tell
the
name
of
her
lover
at
last
the
superior
told
her
that
after
this
fashion
would
they
act
the
coming
night
she
herself
would
be
placed
in
the
crypt
tied
in
front
of
the
window
her
mouth
gagged
that
the
rope
would
be
lowered
and
the
lover
allowed
to
approach
even
to
the
sill
of
her
window
and
at
that
moment
the
rope
would
be
cut
and
before
her
eyes
her
lover
would
be
dashed
to
death
on
the
ragged
cliffs
the
plan
was
feasible
and
sister
maddelena
knew
that
the
mother
was
perfectly
capable
of
carrying
it
out
her
stubborn
spirit
was
broken
and
in
the
only
way
possible
she
begged
for
mercy
for
the
sparing
of
her
lover
the
mother
superior
was
deaf
at
first
at
last
she
said
is
your
life
or
his
i
will
spare
him
on
condition
that
you
sacrifice
your
own
life
sister
maddelena
accepted
the
terms
joyfully
wrote
a
last
farewell
to
michele
fastened
the
note
to
the
rope
and
with
her
own
hands
cut
the
rope
and
saw
it
fall
coiling
down
to
the
valley
bed
far
below
then
she
silently
prepared
for
death
and
at
midnight
while
her
lover
was
wandering
mad
with
the
horror
of
impotent
fear
around
the
white
walls
of
the
convent
sister
maddelena
for
love
of
michele
gave
up
her
life
how
was
never
known
that
she
was
indeed
dead
was
only
a
suspicion
for
when
biscari
finally
compelled
the
civil
authorities
to
enter
the
convent
claiming
that
murder
had
been
done
there
they
found
no
sign
sister
maddelena
had
been
sent
to
the
parent
house
of
the
barefoot
carmelites
at
avila
in
spain
so
the
superior
stated
because
of
her
incorrigible
contumacy
the
old
duke
of
castiglione
refused
to
stir
hand
or
foot
in
the
matter
and
michele
after
fruitless
attempts
to
prove
that
the
superior
of
sta
catarina
had
caused
the
death
was
forced
to
leave
sicily
he
sought
in
spain
for
very
long
but
no
sign
of
the
girl
was
to
be
found
and
at
last
he
died
exhausted
with
suffering
and
sorrow
even
the
name
of
sister
maddelena
was
forgotten
and
it
was
not
until
the
convents
were
suppressed
and
this
house
came
into
the
hands
of
the
muxaros
that
her
story
was
remembered
it
was
then
that
the
ghost
began
to
appear
and
an
explanation
being
necessary
the
story
or
legend
was
obtained
from
one
of
the
nuns
who
still
lived
after
the
suppression
i
think
the
fact
for
it
is
a
fact
of
the
ghost
rather
goes
to
prove
that
michele
was
right
and
that
poor
rosalia
gave
her
life
a
sacrifice
for
love
whether
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
legend
or
not
i
can
not
say
one
or
the
other
of
you
will
probably
see
her
you
might
ask
her
for
the
facts
well
that
is
all
the
story
of
sister
maddelena
known
in
the
world
as
rosalia
di
castiglione
do
you
like
it
it
is
admirable
said
rendel
enthusiastically
but
i
fancy
i
should
rather
look
on
it
simply
as
a
story
and
not
as
a
warning
of
what
is
going
to
happen
i
do
much
fancy
real
ghosts
myself
but
the
poor
sister
is
quite
harmless
and
valguanera
rose
stretching
himself
my
servants
say
she
wants
a
mass
said
over
her
or
something
of
that
kind
but
i
have
much
love
for
such
priestly
i
beg
your
pardon
turning
to
me
i
had
forgotten
that
you
were
a
catholic
forgive
my
rudeness
my
dear
cavaliere
i
beg
you
not
to
apologize
i
am
sorry
you
can
not
see
things
as
i
do
but
do
for
a
moment
think
i
am
hypersensitive
i
have
an
excuse
perhaps
you
will
say
only
an
explanation
but
i
live
where
i
see
all
the
absurdities
and
corruptions
of
the
church
perhaps
you
let
the
accidents
blind
you
to
the
essentials
but
do
not
let
us
quarrel
see
the
storm
is
close
on
us
shall
we
go
in
the
stars
were
blotted
out
through
nearly
all
the
sky
low
thunderous
clouds
massed
at
the
head
of
the
valley
were
sweeping
over
so
close
that
they
seemed
to
brush
the
black
pines
on
the
mountain
above
us
to
the
south
and
east
the
had
shut
down
almost
to
the
sea
leaving
a
space
of
black
sky
where
the
moon
in
its
last
quarter
was
rising
just
to
the
left
of
monte
pellegrino
a
black
silhouette
against
the
pallid
moonlight
the
rosy
lightning
flashed
almost
incessantly
and
through
the
fitful
darkness
came
the
sound
of
bells
across
the
valley
the
rushing
torrent
below
and
the
dull
roar
of
the
approaching
rain
with
a
deep
organ
point
of
solemn
thunder
through
it
all
we
fled
indoors
from
the
coming
tempest
and
taking
our
candles
said
and
sought
each
his
respective
room
my
own
was
in
the
southern
part
of
the
old
convent
giving
on
the
terrace
we
had
just
quitted
and
about
over
the
main
doorway
the
rushing
storm
as
it
swept
down
the
valley
with
the
swelling
torrent
beneath
was
very
fascinating
and
after
wrapping
myself
in
a
i
stood
for
some
time
by
the
deeply
embrasured
window
watching
the
blazing
lightning
and
the
beating
rain
whirled
by
fitful
gusts
of
wind
around
the
spurs
of
the
mountains
gradually
the
violence
of
the
shower
seemed
to
decrease
and
i
threw
myself
down
on
my
bed
in
the
hot
air
wondering
if
i
really
was
to
experience
the
ghostly
visit
the
cavaliere
so
confidently
predicted
i
had
thought
out
the
whole
matter
to
my
own
satisfaction
and
fancied
i
knew
exactly
what
i
should
do
in
case
sister
maddelena
came
to
visit
me
the
story
touched
me
the
thought
of
the
poor
faithful
girl
who
sacrificed
herself
for
her
lover
himself
very
likely
quite
unworthy
and
who
now
could
never
sleep
for
reason
of
her
unquiet
soul
sent
out
into
the
storm
of
eternity
without
spiritual
aid
or
counsel
i
could
not
sleep
for
the
still
vivid
lightning
the
crowding
thoughts
of
the
dead
nun
and
the
shivering
anticipation
of
my
possible
visitation
made
slumber
quite
out
of
the
question
no
suspicion
of
sleepiness
had
visited
me
when
perhaps
an
hour
after
midnight
came
a
sudden
vivid
flash
of
lightning
and
as
my
dazzled
eyes
began
to
regain
the
power
of
sight
i
saw
her
as
plainly
as
in
life
a
tall
figure
shrouded
in
the
white
habit
of
the
carmelites
her
head
bent
her
hands
clasped
before
her
in
another
flash
of
lightning
she
slowly
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
long
and
earnestly
she
was
very
beautiful
like
the
virgin
of
beltraffio
in
the
national
gallery
more
beautiful
than
i
had
supposed
possible
her
deep
passionate
eyes
very
tender
and
pitiful
in
their
pleading
beseeching
glance
i
hardly
think
i
was
frightened
or
even
startled
but
lay
looking
steadily
at
her
as
she
stood
in
the
beating
lightning
then
she
breathed
rather
than
articulated
with
a
voice
that
almost
brought
tears
so
infinitely
sad
and
sorrowful
was
it
i
can
not
sleep
and
the
liquid
eyes
grew
more
pitiful
and
questioning
as
bright
tears
fell
from
them
down
the
pale
dark
face
the
figure
began
to
move
slowly
towards
the
door
its
eyes
fixed
on
mine
with
a
look
that
was
weary
and
almost
agonized
i
leaped
from
the
bed
and
stood
waiting
a
look
of
utter
gratitude
swept
over
the
face
and
turning
the
figure
passed
through
the
doorway
out
into
the
shadow
of
the
corridor
it
moved
like
a
drift
of
pallid
and
i
followed
all
natural
and
instinctive
fear
or
nervousness
quite
blotted
out
by
the
part
i
felt
i
was
to
play
in
giving
rest
to
a
tortured
soul
the
corridors
were
velvet
black
but
the
pale
figure
floated
before
me
always
an
unerring
guide
now
but
a
thin
mist
on
the
utter
night
now
white
and
clear
in
the
bluish
lightning
through
some
window
or
doorway
down
the
stairway
into
the
lower
hall
across
the
refectory
where
the
great
frescoed
crucifixion
flared
into
sudden
clearness
under
the
fitful
lightning
out
into
the
silent
cloister
it
was
very
dark
i
stumbled
along
the
heaving
bricks
now
guiding
myself
by
a
hand
on
the
whitewashed
wall
now
by
a
touch
on
a
column
wet
with
the
storm
from
all
the
eaves
the
rain
was
dripping
on
to
the
pebbles
at
the
foot
of
the
arcade
a
pigeon
startled
from
the
capital
where
it
was
sleeping
beat
its
way
into
the
cloister
close
still
the
white
thing
drifted
before
me
to
the
farther
side
of
the
court
then
along
the
cloister
at
right
angles
and
paused
before
one
of
the
many
doorways
that
led
to
the
cells
a
sudden
blaze
of
fierce
lightning
the
last
now
of
the
fleeting
trail
of
storm
leaped
around
us
and
in
the
vivid
light
i
saw
the
white
face
turned
again
with
the
look
of
overwhelming
desire
of
beseeching
pathos
that
had
choked
my
throat
with
an
involuntary
sob
when
first
i
saw
sister
maddelena
in
the
brief
interval
that
ensued
after
the
flash
and
before
the
roaring
thunder
burst
like
the
crash
of
battle
over
the
trembling
convent
i
heard
again
the
sorrowful
words
i
can
not
sleep
come
from
the
impenetrable
darkness
and
when
the
lightning
came
again
the
white
figure
was
gone
i
wandered
around
the
courtyard
searching
in
vain
for
sister
maddelena
even
until
the
moonlight
broke
through
the
torn
and
sweeping
fringes
of
the
storm
i
tried
the
door
where
the
white
figure
vanished
it
was
locked
but
i
had
found
what
i
sought
and
carefully
noting
its
location
went
back
to
my
room
but
not
to
sleep
in
the
morning
the
cavaliere
asked
rendel
and
me
which
of
us
had
seen
the
ghost
and
i
told
him
my
story
then
i
asked
him
to
grant
me
permission
to
sift
the
thing
to
the
bottom
and
he
courteously
gave
the
whole
matter
into
my
charge
promising
that
he
would
consent
to
anything
i
could
hardly
wait
to
finish
breakfast
but
no
sooner
was
this
done
than
forgetting
my
morning
pipe
i
started
with
rendel
and
the
cavaliere
to
investigate
i
am
sure
there
is
nothing
in
that
cell
said
valguanera
when
we
came
in
front
of
the
door
i
had
marked
it
is
curious
that
you
should
have
chosen
the
door
of
the
very
cell
that
tradition
assigns
to
sister
maddelena
but
i
have
often
examined
that
room
myself
and
i
am
sure
that
there
is
no
chance
for
anything
to
be
concealed
in
fact
i
had
the
floor
taken
up
once
soon
after
i
came
here
knowing
the
room
was
that
of
the
mysterious
sister
and
thinking
that
there
if
anywhere
the
monastic
crime
would
have
taken
place
still
we
will
go
in
if
you
like
he
unlocked
the
door
and
we
entered
one
of
us
at
all
events
with
a
beating
heart
the
cell
was
very
small
hardly
eight
feet
square
there
certainly
seemed
no
opportunity
for
concealing
a
body
in
the
tiny
place
and
although
i
sounded
the
floor
and
walls
all
gave
a
solid
heavy
answer
the
unmistakable
sound
of
masonry
for
the
innocence
of
the
floor
the
cavaliere
answered
he
had
he
said
had
it
all
removed
even
to
the
curving
surfaces
of
the
vault
below
yet
somewhere
in
this
room
the
body
of
the
murdered
girl
was
concealed
of
this
i
was
certain
but
where
there
seemed
no
answer
and
i
was
compelled
to
give
up
the
search
for
the
moment
somewhat
to
the
amusement
of
valguanera
who
had
watched
curiously
to
see
if
i
could
solve
the
mystery
but
i
could
not
forget
the
subject
and
towards
noon
started
on
another
tour
of
investigation
i
procured
the
keys
from
the
cavaliere
and
examined
the
cells
adjoining
they
were
apparently
the
same
each
with
its
window
opposite
the
door
and
nothing
stay
were
they
the
same
i
hastened
into
the
suspected
cell
it
was
as
i
thought
this
cell
being
on
the
corner
could
have
had
two
windows
yet
only
one
was
visible
and
that
to
the
left
at
right
angles
with
the
doorway
was
it
imagination
as
i
sounded
the
wall
opposite
the
door
where
the
other
window
should
be
i
fancied
that
the
sound
was
a
trifle
less
solid
and
dull
i
was
becoming
excited
i
dashed
back
to
the
cell
on
the
right
and
forcing
open
the
little
window
thrust
my
head
out
it
was
found
at
last
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
yellow
wall
was
a
rough
space
following
approximately
the
shape
of
the
other
cell
windows
not
plastered
like
the
rest
of
the
wall
but
showing
the
shapes
of
bricks
through
its
thick
coatings
of
whitewash
i
turned
with
a
gasp
of
excitement
and
satisfaction
yes
the
embrasure
of
the
wall
was
deep
enough
what
a
wall
it
was
four
feet
at
least
and
the
opening
of
the
window
reached
to
the
floor
though
the
window
itself
was
hardly
three
feet
square
i
felt
absolutely
certain
that
the
secret
was
solved
and
called
the
cavaliere
and
rendel
too
excited
to
give
them
an
explanation
of
my
theories
they
must
have
thought
me
mad
when
i
suddenly
began
scraping
away
at
the
solid
wall
in
front
of
the
door
but
in
a
few
minutes
they
understood
what
i
was
about
for
under
the
coatings
of
paint
and
plaster
appeared
the
original
bricks
and
as
my
architectural
knowledge
had
led
me
rightly
the
space
i
had
cleared
was
directly
over
a
vertical
joint
between
firm
workmanlike
masonry
on
one
hand
and
rough
amateurish
work
on
the
other
bricks
laid
anyway
and
without
order
or
science
rendel
seized
a
pick
and
was
about
to
assail
the
rude
wall
when
i
stopped
him
let
us
be
careful
i
said
who
knows
what
we
may
find
so
we
set
to
work
digging
out
the
mortar
around
a
brick
at
about
the
level
of
our
eyes
how
hard
the
mortar
had
become
but
a
brick
yielded
at
last
and
with
trembling
fingers
i
detached
it
darkness
within
yet
beyond
question
there
was
a
cavity
there
not
a
solid
wall
and
with
infinite
care
we
removed
another
brick
still
the
hole
was
too
small
to
admit
enough
light
from
the
dimly
illuminated
cell
with
a
chisel
we
pried
at
the
sides
of
a
large
block
of
masonry
perhaps
eight
bricks
in
size
it
moved
and
we
softly
slid
it
from
its
bed
valguanera
who
was
standing
watching
us
as
we
lowered
the
bricks
to
the
floor
gave
a
sudden
cry
a
cry
like
that
of
a
frightened
woman
terrible
coming
from
him
yet
there
was
cause
framed
by
the
ragged
opening
of
the
bricks
hardly
seen
in
the
dim
light
was
a
face
an
ivory
image
more
beautiful
than
any
antique
bust
but
drawn
and
distorted
by
unspeakable
agony
the
lovely
mouth
half
open
as
though
gasping
for
breath
the
eyes
cast
upward
and
below
slim
chiselled
hands
crossed
on
the
breast
but
clutching
the
folds
of
the
white
carmelite
habit
torture
and
agony
visible
in
every
tense
muscle
fighting
against
the
determination
of
the
rigid
pose
we
stood
there
breathless
staring
at
the
pitiful
sight
fascinated
bewitched
so
this
was
the
secret
with
fiendish
ingenuity
the
rigid
ecclesiastics
had
blocked
up
the
window
then
forced
the
beautiful
creature
to
stand
in
the
alcove
while
with
remorseless
hands
and
iron
hearts
they
had
shut
her
into
a
living
tomb
i
had
read
of
such
things
in
romance
but
to
find
the
verity
here
before
my
eyes
steps
came
down
the
cloister
and
with
a
simultaneous
thought
we
sprang
to
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
us
the
room
was
sacred
that
awful
sight
was
not
for
curious
eyes
the
gardener
was
coming
to
ask
some
trivial
question
of
valguanera
the
cavaliere
cut
him
short
pietro
go
down
to
parco
and
ask
padre
stefano
to
come
here
at
once
i
thanked
him
with
a
glance
stay
he
turned
to
me
signore
it
is
already
two
and
too
late
for
mass
is
it
not
i
nodded
valguanera
thought
a
moment
then
he
said
bring
two
horses
the
signor
americano
will
go
with
you
do
you
understand
then
turning
to
me
you
will
go
will
you
not
i
think
you
can
explain
matters
to
padre
stefano
better
than
i
of
course
i
will
go
more
than
gladly
so
it
happened
that
after
a
hasty
luncheon
i
wound
down
the
mountain
to
parco
found
padre
stefano
explained
my
errand
to
him
found
him
intensely
eager
and
sympathetic
and
by
five
had
him
back
at
the
convent
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
the
resting
of
the
soul
of
the
dead
girl
in
the
warm
twilight
with
the
last
light
of
the
sunset
pouring
into
the
little
cell
through
the
window
where
almost
a
century
ago
rosalia
had
for
the
last
time
said
farewell
to
her
lover
we
gathered
together
to
speed
her
tortured
soul
on
its
journey
so
long
delayed
nothing
was
omitted
all
the
needful
offices
of
the
church
were
said
by
padre
stefano
while
the
light
in
the
window
died
away
and
the
flickering
flames
of
the
candles
carried
by
two
of
the
acolytes
from
san
francesco
threw
fitful
flashes
of
pallid
light
into
the
dark
recess
where
the
white
face
had
prayed
to
heaven
for
a
hundred
years
finally
the
padre
took
the
asperge
from
the
hands
of
one
of
the
acolytes
and
with
a
sign
of
the
cross
in
benediction
while
he
chanted
the
gently
sprinkled
the
holy
water
on
the
upturned
face
instantly
the
whole
vision
crumbled
to
dust
the
face
was
gone
and
where
once
the
candlelight
had
flickered
on
the
perfect
semblance
of
the
girl
dead
so
very
long
it
now
fell
only
on
the
rough
bricks
which
closed
the
window
bricks
laid
with
frozen
hearts
by
pitiless
hands
but
our
task
was
not
done
yet
it
had
been
arranged
that
padre
stefano
should
remain
at
the
convent
all
night
and
that
as
soon
as
midnight
made
it
possible
he
should
say
the
first
mass
for
the
repose
of
the
girl
soul
we
sat
on
the
terrace
talking
over
the
strange
events
of
the
last
crowded
hours
and
i
noted
with
satisfaction
that
the
cavaliere
no
longer
spoke
of
the
church
with
that
hardness
which
had
hurt
me
so
often
it
is
true
that
the
padre
was
with
us
nearly
all
the
time
but
not
only
was
valguanera
courteous
he
was
almost
sympathetic
and
i
wondered
if
it
might
not
prove
that
more
than
one
soul
benefited
by
the
untoward
events
of
the
day
with
the
aid
of
the
astonished
and
delighted
servants
and
no
little
help
as
well
from
signora
valguanera
i
fitted
up
the
long
cold
altar
in
the
chapel
and
by
midnight
we
had
the
gloomy
sanctuary
beautiful
with
flowers
and
candles
it
was
a
curiously
solemn
service
in
the
first
hour
of
the
new
day
in
the
midst
of
blazing
candles
and
the
thick
incense
the
odor
of
the
opening
drifting
up
in
the
fresh
morning
air
and
mingling
with
the
incense
smoke
and
the
perfume
of
flowers
within
many
prayers
were
said
that
night
for
the
soul
of
the
dead
girl
and
i
think
many
afterwards
for
after
the
benediction
i
remained
for
a
little
time
in
my
place
and
when
i
rose
from
my
knees
and
went
towards
the
chapel
door
i
saw
a
figure
kneeling
still
and
with
a
start
recognized
the
form
of
the
cavaliere
i
smiled
with
quiet
satisfaction
and
gratitude
and
went
away
softly
content
with
the
chain
of
events
that
now
seemed
finished
the
next
day
the
alcove
was
again
walled
up
for
the
precious
dust
could
not
be
gathered
together
for
transportation
to
consecrated
ground
so
i
went
down
to
the
little
cemetery
at
parco
for
a
basket
of
earth
which
we
cast
in
over
the
ashes
of
sister
maddelena
by
and
by
when
rendel
and
i
went
away
with
great
regret
valguanera
came
down
to
palermo
with
us
and
the
last
act
that
we
performed
in
sicily
was
assisting
him
to
order
a
tablet
of
marble
whereon
was
carved
this
simple
inscription
here
lies
the
body
of
rosalia
di
castiglioni
called
sister
maddelena
her
soul
is
with
him
who
gave
it
to
this
i
added
in
thought
let
him
that
is
without
sin
among
you
cast
the
first
stone
notre
dame
des
eaux
notre
dame
des
eaux
west
of
pol
de
leon
on
the
of
finisterre
stands
the
ancient
church
of
notre
dame
des
eaux
five
centuries
of
beating
winds
and
sweeping
rains
have
moulded
its
angles
and
worn
its
carvings
and
sculpture
down
to
the
very
semblance
of
the
ragged
cliffs
themselves
until
even
the
breton
fisherman
looking
lovingly
from
his
boat
as
he
makes
for
the
harbor
of
morlaix
hardly
can
say
where
the
crags
end
and
where
the
church
begins
the
teeth
of
the
winds
of
the
sea
have
devoured
bit
by
bit
the
fine
sculpture
of
the
doorway
and
the
thin
cusps
of
the
window
tracery
gray
moss
creeps
caressingly
over
the
worn
walls
in
ineffectual
protection
gentle
vines
turned
crabbed
by
the
harsh
beating
of
the
fierce
winds
clutch
the
crumbling
buttresses
climb
up
over
the
sinking
roof
reach
in
even
at
the
louvres
of
the
belfry
holding
the
little
sanctuary
safe
in
desperate
arms
against
the
savage
warfare
of
the
sea
and
sky
many
a
time
you
may
follow
the
rocky
highway
from
pol
even
around
the
last
land
of
france
and
so
to
brest
yet
never
see
sign
of
notre
dame
des
eaux
for
it
clings
to
a
cliff
somewhat
lower
than
the
road
and
between
grows
a
stunted
thicket
of
harsh
and
ragged
trees
their
skeleton
white
branches
tortured
and
contorted
thrusting
sorrowfully
out
of
the
hard
dark
foliage
that
still
grows
below
where
the
rise
of
land
below
the
highway
gives
some
protection
you
must
leave
the
wood
by
the
two
cottages
of
yellow
stone
about
twenty
miles
beyond
pol
and
go
down
to
the
right
around
the
old
stone
quarry
then
bearing
to
the
left
by
the
little
cliff
path
you
will
in
a
moment
see
the
pointed
roof
of
the
tower
of
notre
dame
and
later
come
down
to
the
side
porch
among
the
crosses
of
the
arid
little
graveyard
it
is
worth
the
walk
for
though
the
church
has
outwardly
little
but
its
sad
picturesqueness
to
repay
the
artist
within
it
is
a
dream
and
a
delight
a
norman
nave
of
round
red
stone
piers
and
arches
a
delicate
choir
of
the
richest
flamboyant
a
high
altar
of
the
time
of
francis
form
only
the
mellow
background
and
frame
for
carven
tombs
and
dark
old
pictures
hanging
lamps
of
iron
and
brass
and
black
heavily
carved
of
the
renaissance
so
has
the
little
church
lain
unnoticed
for
many
centuries
for
the
horrors
and
follies
of
the
revolution
have
never
come
near
and
the
hardy
and
faithful
people
of
finisterre
have
feared
god
and
loved
our
lady
too
well
to
harm
her
church
for
many
years
it
was
the
church
of
the
comtes
de
jarleuc
and
these
are
their
tombs
that
mellow
year
by
year
under
the
warm
light
of
the
painted
windows
given
long
ago
by
comte
robert
de
jarleuc
when
the
heir
of
poullaouen
came
safely
to
shore
in
the
harbor
of
morlaix
having
escaped
from
the
isle
of
wight
where
he
had
lain
captive
after
the
awful
defeat
of
the
fleet
of
charles
of
valois
at
sluys
and
now
the
heir
of
poullaouen
lies
in
a
carven
tomb
forgetful
of
the
world
where
he
fought
so
nobly
the
dynasty
he
fought
to
establish
only
a
memory
the
family
he
made
glorious
a
name
the
château
poullaouen
a
single
crag
of
riven
masonry
in
the
fields
of
du
bois
mayor
of
morlaix
it
was
julien
comte
de
bergerac
who
rediscovered
notre
dame
des
eaux
and
by
his
picture
of
its
dreamy
interior
in
the
salon
of
brought
once
more
into
notice
this
forgotten
corner
of
the
world
the
next
year
a
party
of
painters
settled
themselves
near
by
roughing
it
as
best
they
could
and
in
the
year
following
mme
de
bergerac
and
her
daughter
héloïse
came
with
julien
and
buying
the
old
farm
of
pontivy
on
the
highway
over
notre
dame
turned
it
into
a
summer
house
that
almost
made
amends
for
their
lost
château
on
the
dordogne
stolen
from
them
as
virulent
royalists
by
the
triumphant
republic
in
little
by
little
a
summer
colony
of
painters
gathered
around
pontivy
and
it
was
not
until
the
spring
of
that
the
peace
of
the
colony
was
broken
it
was
a
sorrowful
tragedy
jean
the
youngest
and
merriest
devil
of
all
the
jolly
crew
became
suddenly
moody
and
morose
at
first
this
was
attributed
to
his
undisguised
admiration
for
mlle
héloïse
and
was
looked
on
as
one
of
the
vagaries
of
boyish
passion
but
one
day
while
riding
with
de
bergerac
he
suddenly
seized
the
bridle
of
julien
horse
wrenched
it
from
his
hand
and
turning
his
own
horse
head
towards
the
cliffs
lashed
the
terrified
animals
into
a
gallop
straight
towards
the
brink
he
was
only
thwarted
in
his
mad
object
by
julien
who
with
a
quick
blow
sent
him
headlong
in
the
dry
grass
and
reined
in
the
terrified
animals
hardly
a
yard
from
the
cliffs
when
this
happened
and
no
word
of
explanation
was
granted
only
a
sullen
silence
that
lasted
for
days
it
became
clear
that
poor
brain
was
wrong
in
some
way
héloïse
devoted
herself
to
him
with
infinite
patience
though
she
felt
no
special
affection
for
him
only
pity
and
while
he
was
with
her
he
seemed
sane
and
quiet
but
at
night
some
strange
mania
took
possession
of
him
if
he
had
worked
on
his
prix
de
rome
picture
in
the
daytime
while
héloïse
sat
by
him
reading
aloud
or
singing
a
little
no
matter
how
good
the
work
it
would
have
vanished
in
the
morning
and
he
would
again
begin
only
to
erase
his
labor
during
the
night
at
last
his
growing
insanity
reached
its
climax
and
one
day
in
notre
dame
when
he
had
painted
better
than
usual
he
suddenly
stopped
seized
a
palette
knife
and
slashed
the
great
canvas
in
strips
héloïse
sprang
forward
to
stop
him
and
in
crazy
fury
he
turned
on
her
striking
at
her
throat
with
the
palette
knife
the
thin
steel
snapped
and
the
white
throat
showed
only
a
scarlet
scratch
héloïse
without
that
ordinary
terror
that
would
crush
most
women
grasped
the
thin
wrists
of
the
madman
and
though
he
could
easily
have
wrenched
his
hands
away
sank
on
his
knees
in
a
passion
of
tears
he
shut
himself
in
his
room
at
pontivy
refusing
to
see
any
one
walking
for
hours
up
and
down
fighting
against
growing
madness
soon
charpentier
came
from
paris
summoned
by
mme
de
bergerac
and
after
one
short
forced
interview
left
at
once
for
paris
taking
with
him
a
few
days
later
came
a
letter
for
mme
de
bergerac
in
which
charpentier
confessed
that
jean
had
disappeared
that
he
had
allowed
him
too
much
liberty
owing
to
his
apparent
calmness
and
that
when
the
train
stopped
at
le
mans
he
had
slipped
from
him
and
utterly
vanished
during
the
summer
word
came
occasionally
that
no
trace
had
been
found
of
the
unhappy
man
and
at
last
the
pontivy
colony
realized
that
the
merry
boy
was
dead
had
he
lived
he
have
been
found
for
the
exertions
of
the
police
were
perfect
yet
not
the
slightest
trace
was
discovered
and
his
lamentable
death
was
acknowledged
not
only
by
mme
de
bergerac
and
jean
family
sorrowing
for
the
death
of
their
away
in
the
warm
hills
of
lozère
but
by
charpentier
as
well
so
the
summer
passed
and
the
autumn
came
and
at
last
the
cold
rains
of
november
the
skirmish
line
of
the
advancing
army
of
winter
drove
the
colony
back
to
paris
it
was
the
last
day
at
pontivy
and
mlle
héloïse
had
come
down
to
notre
dame
for
a
last
look
at
the
beautiful
shrine
a
last
prayer
for
the
repose
of
the
tortured
soul
of
poor
jean
the
rains
had
ceased
for
a
time
and
a
warm
stillness
lay
over
the
cliffs
and
on
the
creeping
sea
swaying
and
lapping
around
the
ragged
shore
héloïse
knelt
very
long
before
the
altar
of
our
lady
of
the
waters
and
when
she
finally
rose
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
as
yet
that
place
of
sorrowful
beauty
all
warm
and
golden
with
the
last
light
of
the
declining
sun
she
watched
the
old
verger
pierre
polou
stumping
softly
around
the
darkening
building
and
spoke
to
him
once
asking
the
hour
but
he
was
very
deaf
as
well
as
nearly
blind
and
he
did
not
answer
so
she
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
aisle
by
the
altar
of
our
lady
of
the
waters
watching
the
checkered
light
fade
in
the
advancing
shadows
dreaming
sad
of
the
dead
summer
until
the
merged
in
and
she
fell
asleep
then
the
last
light
of
the
early
sunset
died
in
the
gleaming
quarries
of
the
west
window
pierre
polou
stumbled
uncertainly
through
the
dusky
shadow
locked
the
sagging
doors
of
the
mouldering
south
porch
and
took
his
way
among
the
leaning
crosses
up
to
the
highway
and
his
little
cottage
a
good
mile
away
the
nearest
house
to
the
lonely
church
of
notre
dame
des
eaux
with
the
setting
of
the
sun
great
clouds
rose
swiftly
from
the
sea
the
wind
freshened
and
the
gaunt
branches
of
the
trees
in
the
churchyard
lashed
themselves
beseechingly
before
the
coming
storm
the
tide
turned
and
the
waters
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
swept
uneasily
up
the
narrow
beach
and
caught
at
the
weary
cliffs
their
sobbing
growing
and
deepening
to
a
threatening
solemn
roar
whirls
of
dead
leaves
rose
in
the
churchyard
and
threw
themselves
against
the
blank
windows
the
winter
and
the
night
came
down
together
héloïse
awoke
bewildered
and
wondering
in
a
moment
she
realized
the
situation
and
without
fear
or
uneasiness
there
was
nothing
to
dread
in
notre
dame
by
night
the
ghosts
if
there
were
ghosts
would
not
trouble
her
and
the
doors
were
securely
locked
it
was
foolish
of
her
to
fall
asleep
and
her
mother
would
be
most
uneasy
at
pontivy
if
she
realized
before
dawn
that
héloïse
had
not
returned
on
the
other
hand
she
was
in
the
habit
of
wandering
off
to
walk
after
dinner
often
not
coming
home
until
late
so
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
return
before
madame
knew
of
her
absence
for
polou
came
always
to
unlock
the
church
for
the
low
mass
at
six
so
she
arose
from
her
cramped
position
in
the
aisle
and
walked
slowly
up
to
the
entered
the
chancel
and
felt
her
way
to
one
of
the
stalls
on
the
south
side
where
there
were
cushions
and
an
easy
back
it
was
really
very
beautiful
in
notre
dame
by
night
she
had
never
suspected
how
strange
and
solemn
the
little
church
could
be
when
the
moon
shone
fitfully
through
the
south
windows
now
bright
and
clear
now
blotted
out
by
sweeping
clouds
the
nave
was
barred
with
the
long
shadows
of
the
heavy
pillars
and
when
the
moon
came
out
she
could
see
far
down
almost
to
the
west
end
how
still
it
was
only
a
soft
low
murmur
without
of
the
restless
limbs
of
the
trees
and
of
the
creeping
sea
it
was
very
soothing
almost
like
a
song
and
héloïse
felt
sleep
coming
back
to
her
as
the
clouds
shut
out
the
moon
and
all
the
church
grew
black
she
was
drifting
off
into
the
last
delicious
moment
of
vanishing
consciousness
when
she
suddenly
came
fully
awake
with
a
shock
that
made
every
nerve
tingle
in
the
midst
of
the
far
faint
sounds
of
the
tempestuous
night
she
had
heard
a
footstep
yet
the
church
was
utterly
empty
she
was
sure
and
again
a
footstep
dragging
and
uncertain
stealthy
and
cautious
but
an
unmistakable
step
away
in
the
blackest
shadow
at
the
end
of
the
church
she
sat
up
frozen
with
the
fear
that
comes
at
night
and
that
is
overwhelming
her
hands
clutching
the
coarse
carving
of
the
arms
of
the
stall
staring
down
into
the
dark
again
the
footstep
and
again
slow
measured
one
after
another
at
intervals
of
perhaps
half
a
minute
growing
a
little
louder
each
time
a
little
nearer
would
the
darkness
never
be
broken
would
the
cloud
never
pass
minute
after
minute
went
like
weary
hours
and
still
the
moon
was
hid
still
the
dead
branches
rattled
clatteringly
on
the
high
windows
unconsciously
she
moved
as
under
a
magician
spell
down
to
the
straining
her
eyes
to
pierce
the
thick
night
and
the
step
it
was
very
near
ah
the
moon
at
last
a
white
ray
fell
through
the
westernmost
window
painting
a
bar
of
light
on
the
floor
of
sagging
stone
then
a
second
bar
then
a
third
and
a
fourth
and
for
a
moment
héloïse
could
have
cried
out
with
relief
for
nothing
broke
the
lines
of
light
no
figure
no
shadow
in
another
moment
came
a
step
and
from
the
shadow
of
the
last
column
appeared
in
the
pallid
moonlight
the
figure
of
a
man
the
girl
stared
breathless
the
moonlight
falling
on
her
as
she
stood
rigid
against
the
low
parapet
another
step
and
another
and
she
saw
before
her
was
it
ghost
or
living
man
a
white
mad
face
staring
from
matted
hair
and
beard
a
tall
thin
figure
half
clothed
in
rags
limping
as
it
stepped
towards
her
with
wounded
feet
from
the
dead
face
stared
mad
eyes
that
gleamed
like
the
eyes
of
a
cat
fixed
on
hers
with
insane
persistence
holding
her
fascinating
her
as
a
cat
fascinates
a
bird
one
more
step
it
was
close
before
her
now
those
awful
luminous
eyes
dilating
and
contracting
in
awful
palpitations
and
the
moon
was
going
out
the
shadows
swept
one
by
one
over
the
windows
she
stared
at
the
moonlit
face
for
a
last
fascinated
glance
mother
of
god
it
was
the
shadow
swept
over
them
and
now
only
remained
the
blazing
eyes
and
the
dim
outline
of
a
form
that
crouched
waveringly
before
her
as
a
cat
crouches
drawing
its
vibrating
body
together
for
the
spring
that
blots
out
the
life
of
the
victim
in
another
instant
the
mad
thing
would
leap
but
just
as
the
quiver
swept
over
the
crouching
body
héloïse
gathered
all
her
strength
into
one
action
of
desperate
terror
jean
stop
the
thing
crouched
before
her
paused
chattering
softly
to
itself
then
it
articulated
dryly
and
with
all
the
trouble
of
a
learning
child
the
one
word
without
a
thought
héloïse
sang
it
was
the
first
thing
that
she
remembered
an
old
provençal
song
that
had
always
loved
while
she
sang
the
poor
mad
creature
lay
huddled
at
her
feet
separated
from
her
only
by
the
choir
parapet
its
dilating
contracting
eyes
never
moving
for
an
instant
as
the
song
died
away
came
again
that
awful
tremor
indicative
of
the
coming
and
again
she
sang
this
time
the
old
its
sonorous
latin
sounding
in
the
deserted
church
like
the
voice
of
dead
centuries
and
so
she
sang
on
and
on
hour
after
hour
hymns
and
and
bits
from
comic
operas
songs
of
the
boulevards
alternating
with
the
and
the
filii
et
it
mattered
little
what
she
sang
at
last
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
mattered
little
whether
she
sang
or
no
for
her
brain
whirled
round
and
round
like
a
dizzy
maelstrom
her
icy
hands
griping
the
hard
rail
alone
supported
her
dying
body
she
could
hear
no
sound
of
her
song
her
body
was
numb
her
mouth
parched
her
lips
cracked
and
bleeding
she
felt
the
drops
of
blood
fall
from
her
chin
and
still
she
sang
with
the
yellow
palpitating
eyes
holding
her
as
in
a
vice
if
only
she
could
continue
until
dawn
it
must
be
dawn
so
soon
the
windows
were
growing
gray
the
rain
lashed
outside
she
could
distinguish
the
features
of
the
horror
before
her
but
the
night
of
death
was
growing
with
the
coming
day
blackness
swept
down
upon
her
she
could
sing
no
more
her
tortured
lips
made
one
last
effort
to
form
the
words
mother
of
god
save
me
and
night
and
death
came
down
like
a
crushing
wave
but
her
prayer
was
heard
the
dawn
had
come
and
polou
unlocked
the
for
father
augustin
just
in
time
to
hear
the
last
agonized
cry
the
maniac
turned
in
the
very
act
of
leaping
on
his
victim
and
sprang
for
the
two
men
who
stopped
in
dumb
amazement
poor
old
pierre
polou
went
down
at
a
blow
but
father
augustin
was
young
and
fearless
and
he
grappled
the
mad
animal
with
all
his
strength
and
will
it
would
have
gone
ill
even
with
him
for
no
one
can
stand
against
the
bestial
fury
of
a
man
in
whom
reason
is
dead
had
not
some
sudden
impulse
seized
the
maniac
who
pitched
the
priest
aside
with
a
single
movement
and
leaping
through
the
door
vanished
forever
did
he
hurl
himself
from
the
cliffs
in
the
cold
wet
morning
or
was
he
doomed
to
wander
a
wild
beast
until
captured
he
beat
himself
in
vain
against
the
walls
of
some
asylum
an
unknown
pauper
lunatic
none
ever
knew
the
colony
at
pontivy
was
blotted
out
by
the
dreary
tragedy
and
notre
dame
des
eaux
sank
once
more
into
silence
and
solitude
once
a
year
father
augustin
said
mass
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
jean
but
no
other
memory
remained
of
the
horror
that
blighted
the
lives
of
an
innocent
girl
and
of
a
mother
mourning
for
her
dead
boy
in
far
lozère
the
dead
valley
the
dead
valley
i
have
a
friend
olof
ehrensvärd
a
swede
by
birth
who
yet
by
reason
of
a
strange
and
melancholy
mischance
of
his
early
boyhood
has
thrown
his
lot
with
that
of
the
new
world
it
is
a
curious
story
of
a
headstrong
boy
and
a
proud
and
relentless
family
the
details
do
not
matter
here
but
they
are
sufficient
to
weave
a
web
of
romance
around
the
tall
man
with
the
sad
eyes
and
the
voice
that
gives
itself
perfectly
to
plaintive
little
swedish
songs
remembered
out
of
childhood
in
the
winter
evenings
we
play
chess
together
he
and
i
and
after
some
close
fierce
battle
has
been
fought
to
a
finish
usually
with
my
own
defeat
we
fill
our
pipes
again
and
ehrensvärd
tells
me
stories
of
the
far
days
in
the
fatherland
before
he
went
to
sea
stories
that
grow
very
strange
and
incredible
as
the
night
deepens
and
the
fire
falls
together
but
stories
that
nevertheless
i
fully
believe
one
of
them
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
so
i
set
it
down
here
only
regretting
that
i
can
not
reproduce
the
curiously
perfect
english
and
the
delicate
accent
which
to
me
increased
the
fascination
of
the
tale
yet
as
best
i
can
remember
it
here
it
is
i
never
told
you
how
nils
and
i
went
over
the
hills
to
hallsberg
and
how
we
found
the
dead
valley
did
i
well
this
is
the
way
it
happened
i
must
have
been
about
twelve
years
old
and
nils
sjöberg
whose
father
estate
joined
ours
was
a
few
months
younger
we
were
inseparable
just
at
that
time
and
whatever
we
did
we
did
together
once
a
week
it
was
market
day
in
engelholm
and
nils
and
i
went
always
there
to
see
the
strange
sights
that
the
market
gathered
from
all
the
surrounding
country
one
day
we
quite
lost
our
hearts
for
an
old
man
from
across
the
elfborg
had
brought
a
little
dog
to
sell
that
seemed
to
us
the
most
beautiful
dog
in
all
the
world
he
was
a
round
woolly
puppy
so
funny
that
nils
and
i
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
laughed
at
him
until
he
came
and
played
with
us
in
so
jolly
a
way
that
we
felt
that
there
was
only
one
really
desirable
thing
in
life
and
that
was
the
little
dog
of
the
old
man
from
across
the
hills
but
alas
we
had
not
half
money
enough
wherewith
to
buy
him
so
we
were
forced
to
beg
the
old
man
not
to
sell
him
before
the
next
market
day
promising
that
we
would
bring
the
money
for
him
then
he
gave
us
his
word
and
we
ran
home
very
fast
and
implored
our
mothers
to
give
us
money
for
the
little
dog
we
got
the
money
but
we
could
not
wait
for
the
next
market
day
suppose
the
puppy
should
be
sold
the
thought
frightened
us
so
that
we
begged
and
implored
that
we
might
be
allowed
to
go
over
the
hills
to
hallsberg
where
the
old
man
lived
and
get
the
little
dog
ourselves
and
at
last
they
told
us
we
might
go
by
starting
early
in
the
morning
we
should
reach
hallsberg
by
three
and
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
stay
there
that
night
with
nils
aunt
and
leaving
by
noon
the
next
day
be
home
again
by
sunset
soon
after
sunrise
we
were
on
our
way
after
having
received
minute
instructions
as
to
just
what
we
should
do
in
all
possible
and
impossible
circumstances
and
finally
a
repeated
injunction
that
we
should
start
for
home
at
the
same
hour
the
next
day
so
that
we
might
get
safely
back
before
nightfall
for
us
it
was
magnificent
sport
and
we
started
off
with
our
rifles
full
of
the
sense
of
our
very
great
importance
yet
the
journey
was
simple
enough
along
a
good
road
across
the
big
hills
we
knew
so
well
for
nils
and
i
had
shot
over
half
the
territory
this
side
of
the
dividing
ridge
of
the
elfborg
back
of
engelholm
lay
a
long
valley
from
which
rose
the
low
mountains
and
we
had
to
cross
this
and
then
follow
the
road
along
the
side
of
the
hills
for
three
or
four
miles
before
a
narrow
path
branched
off
to
the
left
leading
up
through
the
pass
nothing
occurred
of
interest
on
the
way
over
and
we
reached
hallsberg
in
due
season
found
to
our
inexpressible
joy
that
the
little
dog
was
not
sold
secured
him
and
so
went
to
the
house
of
nils
aunt
to
spend
the
night
why
we
did
not
leave
early
on
the
following
day
i
ca
quite
remember
at
all
events
i
know
we
stopped
at
a
shooting
range
just
outside
of
the
town
where
most
attractive
pasteboard
pigs
were
sliding
slowly
through
painted
foliage
serving
so
as
beautiful
marks
the
result
was
that
we
did
not
get
fairly
started
for
home
until
afternoon
and
as
we
found
ourselves
at
last
pushing
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
with
the
sun
dangerously
near
their
summits
i
think
we
were
a
little
scared
at
the
prospect
of
the
examination
and
possible
punishment
that
awaited
us
when
we
got
home
at
midnight
therefore
we
hurried
as
fast
as
possible
up
the
mountain
side
while
the
blue
dusk
closed
in
about
us
and
the
light
died
in
the
purple
sky
at
first
we
had
talked
hilariously
and
the
little
dog
had
leaped
ahead
of
us
with
the
utmost
joy
latterly
however
a
curious
oppression
came
on
us
we
did
not
speak
or
even
whistle
while
the
dog
fell
behind
following
us
with
hesitation
in
every
muscle
we
had
passed
through
the
foothills
and
the
low
spurs
of
the
mountains
and
were
almost
at
the
top
of
the
main
range
when
life
seemed
to
go
out
of
everything
leaving
the
world
dead
so
suddenly
silent
the
forest
became
so
stagnant
the
air
instinctively
we
halted
to
listen
perfect
silence
the
crushing
silence
of
deep
forests
at
night
and
more
for
always
even
in
the
most
impenetrable
fastnesses
of
the
wooded
mountains
is
the
multitudinous
murmur
of
little
lives
awakened
by
the
darkness
exaggerated
and
intensified
by
the
stillness
of
the
air
and
the
great
dark
but
here
and
now
the
silence
seemed
unbroken
even
by
the
turn
of
a
leaf
the
movement
of
a
twig
the
note
of
night
bird
or
insect
i
could
hear
the
blood
beat
through
my
veins
and
the
crushing
of
the
grass
under
our
feet
as
we
advanced
with
hesitating
steps
sounded
like
the
falling
of
trees
and
the
air
was
stagnant
dead
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
lie
upon
the
body
like
the
weight
of
sea
on
a
diver
who
has
ventured
too
far
into
its
awful
depths
what
we
usually
call
silence
seems
so
only
in
relation
to
the
din
of
ordinary
experience
this
was
silence
in
the
absolute
and
it
crushed
the
mind
while
it
intensified
the
senses
bringing
down
the
awful
weight
of
inextinguishable
fear
i
know
that
nils
and
i
stared
towards
each
other
in
abject
terror
listening
to
our
quick
heavy
breathing
that
sounded
to
our
acute
senses
like
the
fitful
rush
of
waters
and
the
poor
little
dog
we
were
leading
justified
our
terror
the
black
oppression
seemed
to
crush
him
even
as
it
did
us
he
lay
close
on
the
ground
moaning
feebly
and
dragging
himself
painfully
and
slowly
closer
to
nils
feet
i
think
this
exhibition
of
utter
animal
fear
was
the
last
touch
and
must
inevitably
have
blasted
our
reason
mine
anyway
but
just
then
as
we
stood
quaking
on
the
bounds
of
madness
came
a
sound
so
awful
so
ghastly
so
horrible
that
it
seemed
to
rouse
us
from
the
dead
spell
that
was
on
us
in
the
depth
of
the
silence
came
a
cry
beginning
as
a
low
sorrowful
moan
rising
to
a
tremulous
shriek
culminating
in
a
yell
that
seemed
to
tear
the
night
in
sunder
and
rend
the
world
as
by
a
cataclysm
so
fearful
was
it
that
i
could
not
believe
it
had
actual
existence
it
passed
previous
experience
the
powers
of
belief
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
the
result
of
my
own
animal
terror
an
hallucination
born
of
tottering
reason
a
glance
at
nils
dispelled
this
thought
in
a
flash
in
the
pale
light
of
the
high
stars
he
was
the
embodiment
of
all
possible
human
fear
quaking
with
an
ague
his
jaw
fallen
his
tongue
out
his
eyes
protruding
like
those
of
a
hanged
man
without
a
word
we
fled
the
panic
of
fear
giving
us
strength
and
together
the
little
dog
caught
close
in
nils
arms
we
sped
down
the
side
of
the
cursed
mountains
anywhere
goal
was
of
no
account
we
had
but
one
impulse
to
get
away
from
that
place
so
under
the
black
trees
and
the
far
white
stars
that
flashed
through
the
still
leaves
overhead
we
leaped
down
the
mountain
side
regardless
of
path
or
landmark
straight
through
the
tangled
underbrush
across
mountain
streams
through
fens
and
copses
anywhere
so
only
that
our
course
was
downward
how
long
we
ran
thus
i
have
no
idea
but
by
and
by
the
forest
fell
behind
and
we
found
ourselves
among
the
foothills
and
fell
exhausted
on
the
dry
short
grass
panting
like
tired
dogs
it
was
lighter
here
in
the
open
and
presently
we
looked
around
to
see
where
we
were
and
how
we
were
to
strike
out
in
order
to
find
the
path
that
would
lead
us
home
we
looked
in
vain
for
a
familiar
sign
behind
us
rose
the
great
wall
of
black
forest
on
the
flank
of
the
mountain
before
us
lay
the
undulating
mounds
of
low
foothills
unbroken
by
trees
or
rocks
and
beyond
only
the
fall
of
black
sky
bright
with
multitudinous
stars
that
turned
its
velvet
depth
to
a
luminous
gray
as
i
remember
we
did
not
speak
to
each
other
once
the
terror
was
too
heavy
on
us
for
that
but
by
and
by
we
rose
simultaneously
and
started
out
across
the
hills
still
the
same
silence
the
same
dead
motionless
air
air
that
was
at
once
sultry
and
chilling
a
heavy
heat
struck
through
with
an
icy
chill
that
felt
almost
like
the
burning
of
frozen
steel
still
carrying
the
helpless
dog
nils
pressed
on
through
the
hills
and
i
followed
close
behind
at
last
in
front
of
us
rose
a
slope
of
moor
touching
the
white
stars
we
climbed
it
wearily
reached
the
top
and
found
ourselves
gazing
down
into
a
great
smooth
valley
filled
half
way
to
the
brim
with
what
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
stretched
a
level
plain
of
ashy
white
faintly
phosphorescent
a
sea
of
velvet
fog
that
lay
like
motionless
water
or
rather
like
a
floor
of
alabaster
so
dense
did
it
appear
so
seemingly
capable
of
sustaining
weight
if
it
were
possible
i
think
that
sea
of
dead
white
mist
struck
even
greater
terror
into
my
soul
than
the
heavy
silence
or
the
deadly
cry
so
ominous
was
it
so
utterly
unreal
so
phantasmal
so
impossible
as
it
lay
there
like
a
dead
ocean
under
the
steady
stars
yet
through
that
mist
must
there
seemed
no
other
way
home
and
shattered
with
abject
fear
mad
with
the
one
desire
to
get
back
we
started
down
the
slope
to
where
the
sea
of
milky
mist
ceased
sharp
and
distinct
around
the
stems
of
the
rough
grass
i
put
one
foot
into
the
ghostly
fog
a
chill
as
of
death
struck
through
me
stopping
my
heart
and
i
threw
myself
backward
on
the
slope
at
that
instant
came
again
the
shriek
close
close
right
in
our
ears
in
ourselves
and
far
out
across
that
damnable
sea
i
saw
the
cold
fog
lift
like
a
and
toss
itself
high
in
writhing
convolutions
towards
the
sky
the
stars
began
to
grow
dim
as
thick
vapor
swept
across
them
and
in
the
growing
dark
i
saw
a
great
watery
moon
lift
itself
slowly
above
the
palpitating
sea
vast
and
vague
in
the
gathering
mist
this
was
enough
we
turned
and
fled
along
the
margin
of
the
white
sea
that
throbbed
now
with
fitful
motion
below
us
rising
rising
slowly
and
steadily
driving
us
higher
and
higher
up
the
side
of
the
foothills
it
was
a
race
for
life
that
we
knew
how
we
kept
it
up
i
can
not
understand
but
we
did
and
at
last
we
saw
the
white
sea
fall
behind
us
as
we
staggered
up
the
end
of
the
valley
and
then
down
into
a
region
that
we
knew
and
so
into
the
old
path
the
last
thing
i
remember
was
hearing
a
strange
voice
that
of
nils
but
horribly
changed
stammer
brokenly
dog
is
dead
and
then
the
whole
world
turned
around
twice
slowly
and
resistlessly
and
consciousness
went
out
with
a
crash
it
was
some
three
weeks
later
as
i
remember
that
i
awoke
in
my
own
room
and
found
my
mother
sitting
beside
the
bed
i
could
not
think
very
well
at
first
but
as
i
slowly
grew
strong
again
vague
flashes
of
recollection
began
to
come
to
me
and
little
by
little
the
whole
sequence
of
events
of
that
awful
night
in
the
dead
valley
came
back
all
that
i
could
gain
from
what
was
told
me
was
that
three
weeks
before
i
had
been
found
in
my
own
bed
raging
sick
and
that
my
illness
grew
fast
into
brain
fever
i
tried
to
speak
of
the
dread
things
that
had
happened
to
me
but
i
saw
at
once
that
no
one
looked
on
them
save
as
the
hauntings
of
a
dying
frenzy
and
so
i
closed
my
mouth
and
kept
my
own
counsel
i
must
see
nils
however
and
so
i
asked
for
him
my
mother
told
me
that
he
also
had
been
ill
with
a
strange
fever
but
that
he
was
now
quite
well
again
presently
they
brought
him
in
and
when
we
were
alone
i
began
to
speak
to
him
of
the
night
on
the
mountain
i
shall
never
forget
the
shock
that
struck
me
down
on
my
pillow
when
the
boy
denied
everything
denied
having
gone
with
me
ever
having
heard
the
cry
having
seen
the
valley
or
feeling
the
deadly
chill
of
the
ghostly
fog
nothing
would
shake
his
determined
ignorance
and
in
spite
of
myself
i
was
forced
to
admit
that
his
denials
came
from
no
policy
of
concealment
but
from
blank
oblivion
my
weakened
brain
was
in
a
turmoil
was
it
all
but
the
floating
phantasm
of
delirium
or
had
the
horror
of
the
real
thing
blotted
mind
into
blankness
so
far
as
the
events
of
the
night
in
the
dead
valley
were
concerned
the
latter
explanation
seemed
the
only
one
else
how
explain
the
sudden
illness
which
in
a
night
had
struck
us
both
down
i
said
nothing
more
either
to
nils
or
to
my
own
people
but
waited
with
a
growing
determination
that
once
well
again
i
would
find
that
valley
if
it
really
existed
it
was
some
weeks
before
i
was
really
well
enough
to
go
but
finally
late
in
september
i
chose
a
bright
warm
still
day
the
last
smile
of
the
dying
summer
and
started
early
in
the
morning
along
the
path
that
led
to
hallsberg
i
was
sure
i
knew
where
the
trail
struck
off
to
the
right
down
which
we
had
come
from
the
valley
of
dead
water
for
a
great
tree
grew
by
the
hallsberg
path
at
the
point
where
with
a
sense
of
salvation
we
had
found
the
home
road
presently
i
saw
it
to
the
right
a
little
distance
ahead
i
think
the
bright
sunlight
and
the
clear
air
had
worked
as
a
tonic
to
me
for
by
the
time
i
came
to
the
foot
of
the
great
pine
i
had
quite
lost
faith
in
the
verity
of
the
vision
that
haunted
me
believing
at
last
that
it
was
indeed
but
the
nightmare
of
madness
nevertheless
i
turned
sharply
to
the
right
at
the
base
of
the
tree
into
a
narrow
path
that
led
through
a
dense
thicket
as
i
did
so
i
tripped
over
something
a
swarm
of
flies
sung
into
the
air
around
me
and
looking
down
i
saw
the
matted
fleece
with
the
poor
little
bones
thrusting
through
of
the
dog
we
had
bought
in
hallsberg
then
my
courage
went
out
with
a
puff
and
i
knew
that
it
all
was
true
and
that
now
i
was
frightened
pride
and
the
desire
for
adventure
urged
me
on
however
and
i
pressed
into
the
close
thicket
that
barred
my
way
the
path
was
hardly
visible
merely
the
worn
road
of
some
small
beasts
for
though
it
showed
in
the
crisp
grass
the
bushes
above
grew
thick
and
hardly
penetrable
the
land
rose
slowly
and
rising
grew
clearer
until
at
last
i
came
out
on
a
great
slope
of
hill
unbroken
by
trees
or
shrubs
very
like
my
memory
of
that
rise
of
land
we
had
topped
in
order
that
we
might
find
the
dead
valley
and
the
icy
fog
i
looked
at
the
sun
it
was
bright
and
clear
and
all
around
insects
were
humming
in
the
autumn
air
and
birds
were
darting
to
and
fro
surely
there
was
no
danger
not
until
nightfall
at
least
so
i
began
to
whistle
and
with
a
rush
mounted
the
last
crest
of
brown
hill
there
lay
the
dead
valley
a
great
oval
basin
almost
as
smooth
and
regular
as
though
made
by
man
on
all
sides
the
grass
crept
over
the
brink
of
the
encircling
hills
dusty
green
on
the
crests
then
fading
into
ashy
brown
and
so
to
a
deadly
white
this
last
color
forming
a
thin
ring
running
in
a
long
line
around
the
slope
and
then
nothing
bare
brown
hard
earth
glittering
with
grains
of
alkali
but
otherwise
dead
and
barren
not
a
tuft
of
grass
not
a
stick
of
brushwood
not
even
a
stone
but
only
the
vast
expanse
of
beaten
clay
in
the
midst
of
the
basin
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
away
the
level
expanse
was
broken
by
a
great
dead
tree
rising
leafless
and
gaunt
into
the
air
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
started
down
into
the
valley
and
made
for
this
goal
every
particle
of
fear
seemed
to
have
left
me
and
even
the
valley
itself
did
not
look
so
very
terrifying
at
all
events
i
was
driven
by
an
overwhelming
curiosity
and
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
thing
in
the
world
to
do
to
get
to
that
tree
as
i
trudged
along
over
the
hard
earth
i
noticed
that
the
multitudinous
voices
of
birds
and
insects
had
died
away
no
bee
or
butterfly
hovered
through
the
air
no
insects
leaped
or
crept
over
the
dull
earth
the
very
air
itself
was
stagnant
as
i
drew
near
the
skeleton
tree
i
noticed
the
glint
of
sunlight
on
a
kind
of
white
mound
around
its
roots
and
i
wondered
curiously
it
was
not
until
i
had
come
close
that
i
saw
its
nature
all
around
the
roots
and
barkless
trunk
was
heaped
a
wilderness
of
little
bones
tiny
skulls
of
rodents
and
of
birds
thousands
of
them
rising
about
the
dead
tree
and
streaming
off
for
several
yards
in
all
directions
until
the
dreadful
pile
ended
in
isolated
skulls
and
scattered
skeletons
here
and
there
a
larger
bone
appeared
the
thigh
of
a
sheep
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
and
to
one
side
grinning
slowly
a
human
skull
i
stood
quite
still
staring
with
all
my
eyes
when
suddenly
the
dense
silence
was
broken
by
a
faint
forlorn
cry
high
over
my
head
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
great
falcon
turning
and
sailing
downward
just
over
the
tree
in
a
moment
more
she
fell
motionless
on
the
bleaching
bones
horror
struck
me
and
i
rushed
for
home
my
brain
whirling
a
strange
numbness
growing
in
me
i
ran
steadily
on
and
on
at
last
i
glanced
up
where
was
the
rise
of
hill
i
looked
around
wildly
close
before
me
was
the
dead
tree
with
its
pile
of
bones
i
had
circled
it
round
and
round
and
the
valley
wall
was
still
a
mile
and
a
half
away
i
stood
dazed
and
frozen
the
sun
was
sinking
red
and
dull
towards
the
line
of
hills
in
the
east
the
dark
was
growing
fast
was
there
still
time
it
was
not
i
wanted
it
was
my
feet
seemed
clogged
as
in
a
nightmare
i
could
hardly
drag
them
over
the
barren
earth
and
then
i
felt
the
slow
chill
creeping
through
me
i
looked
down
out
of
the
earth
a
thin
mist
was
rising
collecting
in
little
pools
that
grew
ever
larger
until
they
joined
here
and
there
their
currents
swirling
slowly
like
thin
blue
smoke
the
western
hills
halved
the
copper
sun
when
it
was
dark
i
should
hear
that
shriek
again
and
then
i
should
die
i
knew
that
and
with
every
remaining
atom
of
will
i
staggered
towards
the
red
west
through
the
writhing
mist
that
crept
clammily
around
my
ankles
retarding
my
steps
and
as
i
fought
my
way
off
from
the
tree
the
horror
grew
until
at
last
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
the
silence
pursued
me
like
dumb
ghosts
the
still
air
held
my
breath
the
hellish
fog
caught
at
my
feet
like
cold
hands
but
i
won
though
not
a
moment
too
soon
as
i
crawled
on
my
hands
and
knees
up
the
brown
slope
i
heard
far
away
and
high
in
the
air
the
cry
that
already
had
almost
bereft
me
of
reason
it
was
faint
and
vague
but
unmistakable
in
its
horrible
intensity
i
glanced
behind
the
fog
was
dense
and
pallid
heaving
undulously
up
the
brown
slope
the
sky
was
gold
under
the
setting
sun
but
below
was
the
ashy
gray
of
death
i
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
brink
of
this
sea
of
hell
and
then
leaped
down
the
slope
the
sunset
opened
before
me
the
night
closed
behind
and
as
i
crawled
home
weak
and
tired
darkness
shut
down
on
the
dead
valley
postscript
there
seem
to
be
certain
roots
existing
in
all
countries
from
which
spring
the
current
legends
of
the
supernatural
and
therefore
for
the
germs
of
the
stories
in
this
book
the
author
claims
no
originality
these
legends
differ
one
from
the
other
only
in
local
color
and
in
individual
treatment
if
the
author
has
succeeded
in
clothing
one
or
two
of
these
norms
in
some
slightly
new
vesture
