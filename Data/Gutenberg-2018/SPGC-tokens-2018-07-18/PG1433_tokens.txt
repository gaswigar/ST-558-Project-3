the
red
inn
in
i
know
not
what
year
a
parisian
banker
who
had
very
extensive
commercial
relations
with
germany
was
entertaining
at
dinner
one
of
those
friends
whom
men
of
business
often
make
in
the
markets
of
the
world
through
correspondence
a
man
hitherto
personally
unknown
to
him
this
friend
the
head
of
a
rather
important
house
in
nuremburg
was
a
stout
worthy
german
a
man
of
taste
and
erudition
above
all
a
man
of
pipes
having
a
fine
broad
nuremburgian
face
with
a
square
open
forehead
adorned
by
a
few
sparse
locks
of
yellowish
hair
he
was
the
type
of
the
sons
of
that
pure
and
noble
germany
so
fertile
in
honorable
natures
whose
peaceful
manners
and
morals
have
never
been
lost
even
after
seven
invasions
this
stranger
laughed
with
simplicity
listened
attentively
and
drank
remarkably
well
seeming
to
like
champagne
as
much
perhaps
as
he
liked
his
johannisburger
his
name
was
hermann
which
is
that
of
most
germans
whom
authors
bring
upon
their
scene
like
a
man
who
does
nothing
frivolously
he
was
sitting
squarely
at
the
banker
table
and
eating
with
that
teutonic
appetite
so
celebrated
throughout
europe
saying
in
fact
a
conscientious
farewell
to
the
cookery
of
the
great
careme
to
do
honor
to
his
guest
the
master
of
the
house
had
invited
a
few
intimate
friends
capitalists
or
merchants
and
several
agreeable
and
pretty
women
whose
pleasant
chatter
and
frank
manners
were
in
harmony
with
german
cordiality
really
if
you
could
have
seen
as
i
saw
this
joyous
gathering
of
persons
who
had
drawn
in
their
commercial
claws
and
were
speculating
only
on
the
pleasures
of
life
you
would
have
found
no
cause
to
hate
usurious
discounts
or
to
curse
bankruptcies
mankind
ca
always
be
doing
evil
even
in
the
society
of
pirates
one
might
find
a
few
sweet
hours
during
which
we
could
fancy
their
sinister
craft
a
rocking
on
the
deep
before
we
part
monsieur
hermann
will
i
trust
tell
one
more
german
story
to
terrify
us
these
words
were
said
at
dessert
by
a
pale
fair
girl
who
had
read
no
doubt
the
tales
of
hoffmann
and
the
novels
of
walter
scott
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
the
banker
a
charming
young
creature
whose
education
was
then
being
finished
at
the
gymnase
the
plays
of
which
she
adored
at
this
moment
the
guests
were
in
that
happy
state
of
laziness
and
silence
which
follows
a
delicious
dinner
especially
if
we
have
presumed
too
far
on
our
digestive
powers
leaning
back
in
their
chairs
their
wrists
lightly
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
they
were
indolently
playing
with
the
gilded
blades
of
their
when
a
dinner
comes
to
this
declining
moment
some
guests
will
be
seen
to
play
with
a
pear
seed
others
roll
crumbs
of
bread
between
their
fingers
and
thumbs
lovers
trace
indistinct
letters
with
fragments
of
fruit
misers
count
the
stones
on
their
plate
and
arrange
them
as
a
manager
marshals
his
supernumeraries
at
the
back
of
the
stage
these
are
little
gastronomic
felicities
which
otherwise
so
complete
an
author
overlooked
in
his
book
the
footmen
had
disappeared
the
dessert
was
like
a
squadron
after
a
battle
all
the
dishes
were
disabled
pillaged
damaged
several
were
wandering
around
the
table
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
to
keep
them
in
their
places
some
of
the
persons
present
were
gazing
at
pictures
of
swiss
scenery
symmetrically
hung
upon
the
walls
of
the
not
a
single
guest
was
bored
in
fact
i
never
yet
knew
a
man
who
was
sad
during
his
digestion
of
a
good
dinner
we
like
at
such
moments
to
remain
in
quietude
a
species
of
middle
ground
between
the
reverie
of
a
thinker
and
the
comfort
of
the
ruminating
animals
a
condition
which
we
may
call
the
material
melancholy
of
gastronomy
so
the
guests
now
turned
spontaneously
to
the
excellent
german
delighted
to
have
a
tale
to
listen
to
even
though
it
might
prove
of
no
interest
during
this
blessed
interregnum
the
voice
of
a
narrator
is
always
delightful
to
our
languid
senses
it
increases
their
negative
happiness
i
a
seeker
after
impressions
admired
the
faces
about
me
enlivened
by
smiles
beaming
in
the
light
of
the
wax
candles
and
somewhat
flushed
by
our
late
good
cheer
their
diverse
expressions
producing
piquant
effects
seen
among
the
porcelain
baskets
the
fruits
the
glasses
and
the
candelabra
all
of
a
sudden
my
imagination
was
caught
by
the
aspect
of
a
guest
who
sat
directly
in
front
of
me
he
was
a
man
of
medium
height
rather
fat
and
smiling
having
the
air
and
manner
of
a
and
apparently
endowed
with
a
very
ordinary
mind
hitherto
i
had
scarcely
noticed
him
but
now
his
face
possibly
darkened
by
a
change
in
the
lights
seemed
to
me
to
have
altered
its
character
it
had
certainly
grown
ghastly
violet
tones
were
spreading
over
it
you
might
have
thought
it
the
cadaverous
head
of
a
dying
man
motionless
as
the
personages
painted
on
a
diorama
his
stupefied
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
sparkling
facets
of
a
stopper
but
certainly
without
observing
them
he
seemed
to
be
engulfed
in
some
weird
contemplation
of
the
future
or
the
past
when
i
had
long
examined
that
puzzling
face
i
began
to
reflect
about
it
is
he
ill
i
said
to
myself
has
he
drunk
too
much
wine
is
he
ruined
by
a
drop
in
the
funds
is
he
thinking
how
to
cheat
his
creditors
look
i
said
to
my
neighbor
pointing
out
to
her
the
face
of
the
unknown
man
is
that
an
embryo
bankrupt
oh
no
she
answered
he
would
be
much
gayer
then
nodding
her
head
gracefully
she
added
if
that
man
ever
ruins
himself
i
tell
it
in
pekin
he
possesses
a
million
in
real
estate
that
a
former
purveyor
to
the
imperial
armies
a
good
sort
of
man
and
rather
original
he
married
a
second
time
by
way
of
speculation
but
for
all
that
he
makes
his
wife
extremely
happy
he
has
a
pretty
daughter
whom
he
refused
for
many
years
to
recognize
but
the
death
of
his
son
unfortunately
killed
in
a
duel
has
compelled
him
to
take
her
home
for
he
could
not
otherwise
have
children
the
poor
girl
has
suddenly
become
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
paris
the
death
of
his
son
threw
the
poor
man
into
an
agony
of
grief
which
sometimes
reappears
on
the
surface
at
that
instant
the
purveyor
raised
his
eyes
and
rested
them
upon
me
that
glance
made
me
quiver
so
full
was
it
of
gloomy
thought
but
suddenly
his
face
grew
lively
he
picked
up
the
stopper
and
put
it
with
a
mechanical
movement
into
a
decanter
full
of
water
that
was
near
his
plate
and
then
he
turned
to
monsieur
hermann
and
smiled
after
all
that
man
now
beatified
by
gastronomical
enjoyments
had
probably
two
ideas
in
his
brain
and
was
thinking
of
nothing
consequently
i
felt
rather
ashamed
of
wasting
my
powers
of
divination
in
anima
vili
of
a
doltish
financier
while
i
was
thus
making
at
a
dead
loss
these
phrenological
observations
the
worthy
german
had
lined
his
nose
with
a
good
pinch
of
snuff
and
was
now
beginning
his
tale
it
would
be
difficult
to
reproduce
it
in
his
own
language
with
his
frequent
interruptions
and
wordy
digressions
therefore
i
now
write
it
down
in
my
own
way
leaving
out
the
faults
of
the
nuremburger
and
taking
only
what
his
tale
may
have
had
of
interest
and
poesy
with
the
coolness
of
writers
who
forget
to
put
on
the
title
pages
of
their
books
translated
from
the
german
thought
and
act
toward
the
end
of
venemiaire
year
a
republican
period
which
in
the
present
day
corresponds
to
october
two
young
men
leaving
bonn
in
the
early
morning
had
reached
by
nightfall
the
environs
of
andernach
a
small
town
standing
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
a
few
leagues
from
coblentz
at
that
time
the
french
army
commanded
by
augereau
was
manoeuvring
before
the
austrians
who
then
occupied
the
right
bank
of
the
river
the
headquarters
of
the
republican
division
was
at
coblentz
and
one
of
the
belonging
to
augereau
corps
was
stationed
at
andernach
the
two
travellers
were
frenchmen
at
sight
of
their
uniforms
blue
mixed
with
white
and
faced
with
red
velvet
their
sabres
and
above
all
their
hats
covered
with
a
green
and
adorned
with
a
tricolor
plume
even
the
german
peasants
had
recognized
army
surgeons
a
body
of
men
of
science
and
merit
liked
for
the
most
part
not
only
in
our
own
army
but
also
in
the
countries
invaded
by
our
troops
at
this
period
many
sons
of
good
families
taken
from
their
medical
studies
by
the
recent
conscription
law
due
to
general
jourdan
had
naturally
preferred
to
continue
their
studies
on
the
rather
than
be
restricted
to
mere
military
duty
little
in
keeping
with
their
early
education
and
their
peaceful
destinies
men
of
science
pacific
yet
useful
these
young
men
did
an
actual
good
in
the
midst
of
so
much
misery
and
formed
a
bond
of
sympathy
with
other
men
of
science
in
the
various
countries
through
which
the
cruel
civilization
of
the
republic
passed
the
two
young
men
were
each
provided
with
a
pass
and
a
commission
as
signed
coste
and
bernadotte
and
they
were
on
their
way
to
join
the
to
which
they
were
attached
both
belonged
to
moderately
rich
families
in
beauvais
a
town
in
which
the
gentle
manners
and
loyalty
of
the
provinces
are
transmitted
as
a
species
of
birthright
attracted
to
the
theatre
of
war
before
the
date
at
which
they
were
required
to
begin
their
functions
they
had
travelled
by
diligence
to
strasburg
though
maternal
prudence
had
only
allowed
them
a
slender
sum
of
money
they
thought
themselves
rich
in
possessing
a
few
louis
an
actual
treasure
in
those
days
when
assignats
were
reaching
their
lowest
depreciation
and
gold
was
worth
far
more
than
silver
the
two
young
surgeons
about
twenty
years
of
age
at
the
most
yielded
themselves
up
to
the
poesy
of
their
situation
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
between
strasburg
and
bonn
they
had
visited
the
electorate
and
the
banks
of
the
rhine
as
artists
philosophers
and
observers
when
a
man
destiny
is
scientific
he
is
at
their
age
a
being
who
is
truly
even
in
making
love
or
in
travelling
an
should
be
gathering
up
the
rudiments
of
his
fortune
or
his
coming
fame
the
two
young
had
therefore
given
themselves
wholly
to
that
deep
admiration
which
must
affect
all
educated
men
on
seeing
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
the
scenery
of
suabia
between
mayenne
and
cologne
a
strong
rich
vigorously
varied
nature
filled
with
feudal
memories
ever
fresh
and
verdant
yet
retaining
at
all
points
the
imprints
of
fire
and
sword
louis
xiv
and
turenne
have
cauterized
that
beautiful
land
here
and
there
certain
ruins
bear
witness
to
the
pride
or
rather
the
foresight
of
the
king
of
versailles
who
caused
to
be
pulled
down
the
ancient
castles
that
once
adorned
this
part
of
germany
looking
at
this
marvellous
country
covered
with
forests
where
the
picturesque
charm
of
the
middle
ages
abounds
though
in
ruins
we
are
able
to
conceive
the
german
genius
its
reverie
its
mysticism
the
stay
of
the
two
friends
at
bonn
had
the
double
purpose
of
science
and
pleasure
the
grand
hospital
of
the
army
and
of
augereau
division
was
established
in
the
very
palace
of
the
elector
these
of
recent
date
went
there
to
see
old
comrades
to
present
their
letters
of
recommendation
to
their
medical
chiefs
and
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
first
aspects
of
their
profession
there
as
elsewhere
they
got
rid
of
a
few
prejudices
to
which
we
cling
so
fondly
in
favor
of
the
beauties
of
our
native
land
surprised
by
the
aspect
of
the
columns
of
marble
which
adorn
the
electoral
palace
they
went
about
admiring
the
grandiose
effects
of
german
architecture
and
finding
everywhere
new
treasures
both
modern
and
antique
from
time
to
time
the
highways
along
which
the
two
friends
rode
at
leisure
on
their
way
to
andernach
led
them
over
the
crest
of
some
granite
hill
that
was
higher
than
the
rest
thence
through
a
clearing
of
the
forest
or
cleft
in
the
rocky
barrier
they
caught
sudden
glimpses
of
the
rhine
framed
in
stone
or
festooned
with
vigorous
vegetation
the
valleys
the
forest
paths
the
trees
exhaled
that
autumnal
odor
which
induced
to
reverie
the
wooded
summits
were
beginning
to
gild
and
to
take
on
the
warm
brown
tones
significant
of
age
the
leaves
were
falling
but
the
skies
were
still
azure
and
the
dry
roads
lay
like
yellow
lines
along
the
landscape
just
then
illuminated
by
the
oblique
rays
of
the
setting
sun
at
a
mile
and
a
half
from
andernach
the
two
friends
walked
their
horses
in
silence
as
if
no
war
were
devastating
this
beautiful
land
while
they
followed
a
path
made
for
the
goats
across
the
lofty
walls
of
bluish
granite
between
which
foams
the
rhine
presently
they
descended
by
one
of
the
declivities
of
the
gorge
at
the
foot
of
which
is
placed
the
little
town
seated
coquettishly
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
offering
a
convenient
port
to
mariners
germany
is
a
beautiful
country
cried
one
of
the
two
young
men
who
was
named
prosper
magnan
at
the
moment
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
painted
houses
of
andernach
pressed
together
like
eggs
in
a
basket
and
separated
only
by
trees
gardens
and
flowers
then
he
admired
for
a
moment
the
pointed
roofs
with
their
projecting
eaves
the
wooden
staircases
the
galleries
of
a
thousand
peaceful
dwellings
and
the
vessels
swaying
to
the
waves
in
the
port
at
the
moment
when
monsieur
hermann
uttered
the
name
of
prosper
magnan
my
opposite
neighbor
seized
the
decanter
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
and
emptied
it
at
a
draught
this
movement
having
attracted
my
attention
i
thought
i
noticed
a
slight
trembling
of
the
hand
and
a
moisture
on
the
brow
of
the
capitalist
what
is
that
man
name
i
asked
my
neighbor
taillefer
she
replied
do
you
feel
ill
i
said
to
him
observing
that
this
strange
personage
was
turning
pale
not
at
all
he
said
with
a
polite
gesture
of
thanks
i
am
listening
he
added
with
a
nod
to
the
guests
who
were
all
simultaneously
looking
at
him
i
have
forgotten
said
monsieur
hermann
the
name
of
the
other
young
man
but
the
confidences
which
prosper
magnan
subsequently
made
to
me
enabled
me
to
know
that
his
companion
was
dark
rather
thin
and
jovial
i
will
if
you
please
call
him
wilhelm
to
give
greater
clearness
to
the
tale
i
am
about
to
tell
you
the
worthy
german
resumed
his
narrative
after
having
without
the
smallest
regard
for
romanticism
and
local
color
baptized
the
young
french
surgeon
with
a
teutonic
name
by
the
time
the
two
young
men
reached
andernach
the
night
was
dark
presuming
that
they
would
lose
much
time
in
looking
for
their
chiefs
and
obtaining
from
them
a
military
billet
in
a
town
already
full
of
soldiers
they
resolved
to
spend
their
last
night
of
freedom
at
an
inn
standing
some
two
or
three
hundred
feet
from
andernach
the
rich
color
of
which
embellished
by
the
fires
of
the
setting
sun
they
had
greatly
admired
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
above
the
town
painted
entirely
red
this
inn
produced
a
most
piquant
effect
in
the
landscape
whether
by
detaching
itself
from
the
general
background
of
the
town
or
by
contrasting
its
scarlet
sides
with
the
verdure
of
the
surrounding
foliage
and
the
tints
of
the
water
this
house
owed
its
name
the
red
inn
to
this
external
decoration
imposed
upon
it
no
doubt
from
time
immemorial
by
the
caprice
of
its
founder
a
mercantile
superstition
natural
enough
to
the
different
possessors
of
the
building
among
the
sailors
of
the
rhine
had
made
them
scrupulous
to
preserve
the
title
hearing
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
the
master
of
the
red
inn
came
out
upon
the
threshold
of
his
door
by
heavens
gentlemen
he
cried
a
little
later
and
you
have
had
to
sleep
beneath
the
stars
like
a
good
many
more
of
your
compatriots
who
are
bivouacking
on
the
other
side
of
andernach
here
every
room
is
occupied
if
you
want
to
sleep
in
a
good
bed
i
have
only
my
own
room
to
offer
you
as
for
your
horses
i
can
litter
them
down
in
a
corner
of
the
courtyard
the
stable
is
full
of
people
do
these
gentlemen
come
from
france
he
added
after
a
slight
pause
from
bonn
cried
prosper
and
we
have
eaten
nothing
since
morning
oh
as
to
provisions
said
the
innkeeper
nodding
his
head
people
come
to
the
red
inn
for
their
wedding
feast
from
thirty
miles
round
you
shall
have
a
princely
meal
a
rhine
fish
more
i
need
not
say
after
confiding
their
weary
steeds
to
the
care
of
the
landlord
who
vainly
called
to
his
hostler
the
two
young
men
entered
the
public
room
of
the
inn
thick
white
clouds
exhaled
by
a
numerous
company
of
smokers
prevented
them
from
at
first
recognizing
the
persons
with
whom
they
were
thrown
but
after
sitting
awhile
near
the
table
with
the
patience
practised
by
philosophical
travellers
who
know
the
inutility
of
making
a
fuss
they
distinguished
through
the
vapors
of
tobacco
the
inevitable
accessories
of
a
german
inn
the
stove
the
clock
the
pots
of
beer
the
long
pipes
and
here
and
there
the
eccentric
physiognomies
of
jews
or
germans
and
the
faces
of
mariners
the
epaulets
of
several
french
officers
were
glittering
through
the
mist
and
the
clank
of
spurs
and
sabres
echoed
incessantly
from
the
brick
floor
some
were
playing
cards
others
argued
or
held
their
tongues
and
ate
drank
or
walked
about
one
stout
little
woman
wearing
a
black
velvet
cap
blue
and
silver
stomacher
pincushion
bunch
of
keys
silver
buckles
braided
hair
all
distinctive
signs
of
the
mistress
of
a
german
inn
a
costume
which
has
been
so
often
depicted
in
colored
prints
that
it
is
too
common
to
describe
here
well
this
wife
of
the
innkeeper
kept
the
two
friends
alternately
patient
and
impatient
with
remarkable
ability
little
by
little
the
noise
decreased
the
various
travellers
retired
to
their
rooms
the
clouds
of
smoke
dispersed
when
places
were
set
for
the
two
young
men
and
the
classic
carp
of
the
rhine
appeared
upon
the
table
eleven
was
striking
and
the
room
was
empty
the
silence
of
night
enabled
the
young
surgeons
to
hear
vaguely
the
noise
their
horses
made
in
eating
their
provender
and
the
murmur
of
the
waters
of
the
rhine
together
with
those
indefinable
sounds
which
always
enliven
an
inn
when
filled
with
persons
preparing
to
go
to
bed
doors
and
windows
are
opened
and
shut
voices
murmur
vague
words
and
a
few
interpellations
echo
along
the
passages
at
this
moment
of
silence
and
tumult
the
two
frenchmen
and
their
landlord
who
was
boasting
of
andernach
his
inn
his
cookery
the
rhine
wines
the
republican
army
and
his
wife
were
all
three
listening
with
a
sort
of
interest
to
the
hoarse
cries
of
sailors
in
a
boat
which
appeared
to
be
coming
to
the
wharf
the
innkeeper
familiar
no
doubt
with
the
guttural
shouts
of
the
boatmen
went
out
hastily
but
presently
returned
conducting
a
short
stout
man
behind
whom
walked
two
sailors
carrying
a
heavy
valise
and
several
packages
when
these
were
deposited
in
the
room
the
short
man
took
the
valise
and
placed
it
beside
him
as
he
seated
himself
without
ceremony
at
the
same
table
as
the
surgeons
go
and
sleep
in
your
boat
he
said
to
the
boatmen
as
the
inn
is
full
considering
all
things
that
is
best
monsieur
said
the
landlord
to
the
these
are
all
the
provisions
i
have
left
pointing
to
the
supper
served
to
the
two
frenchmen
i
have
so
much
as
another
crust
of
bread
nor
a
bone
no
not
enough
to
put
in
my
wife
thimble
as
i
had
the
honor
to
tell
you
just
now
you
can
have
no
bed
but
the
chair
on
which
you
are
sitting
and
no
other
chamber
than
this
public
room
at
these
words
the
little
man
cast
upon
the
landlord
the
room
and
the
two
frenchmen
a
look
in
which
caution
and
alarm
were
equally
expressed
here
said
monsieur
hermann
interrupting
himself
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
we
have
never
known
the
real
name
nor
the
history
of
this
man
his
papers
showed
that
he
came
from
he
called
himself
wahlenfer
and
said
that
he
owned
a
rather
extensive
pin
manufactory
in
the
suburbs
of
neuwied
like
all
the
manufacturers
of
that
region
he
wore
a
surtout
coat
of
common
cloth
waistcoat
and
breeches
of
dark
green
velveteen
stout
boots
and
a
broad
leather
belt
his
face
was
round
his
manners
frank
and
cordial
but
during
the
evening
he
seemed
unable
to
disguise
altogether
some
secret
apprehension
or
possibly
some
anxious
care
the
innkeeper
opinion
has
always
been
that
this
german
merchant
was
fleeing
his
country
later
i
heard
that
his
manufactory
had
been
burned
by
one
of
those
unfortunate
chances
so
frequent
in
times
of
war
in
spite
of
its
anxious
expression
the
face
showed
great
kindliness
his
features
were
handsome
and
the
whiteness
of
his
stout
throat
was
well
set
off
by
a
black
cravat
a
fact
which
wilhelm
showed
jestingly
to
prosper
here
monsieur
taillefer
drank
another
glass
of
water
prosper
courteously
proposed
that
the
merchant
should
share
their
supper
and
wahlenfer
accepted
the
offer
without
ceremony
like
a
man
who
feels
himself
able
to
return
a
civility
he
placed
his
valise
on
the
floor
and
put
his
feet
on
it
took
off
his
hat
and
gloves
and
removed
a
pair
of
pistols
from
his
belt
the
landlord
having
by
this
time
set
a
knife
and
fork
for
him
the
three
guests
began
to
satisfy
their
appetites
in
silence
the
atmosphere
of
this
room
was
hot
and
the
flies
were
so
numerous
that
prosper
requested
the
landlord
to
open
the
window
looking
toward
the
outer
gate
so
as
to
change
the
air
this
window
was
barricaded
by
an
iron
bar
the
two
ends
of
which
were
inserted
into
holes
made
in
the
window
casings
for
greater
security
two
bolts
were
screwed
to
each
shutter
prosper
accidentally
noticed
the
manner
in
which
the
landlord
managed
these
obstacles
and
opened
the
window
as
i
am
now
speaking
of
localities
this
is
the
place
to
describe
to
you
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
inn
for
on
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
premises
depends
an
understanding
of
my
tale
the
public
room
in
which
the
three
persons
i
have
named
to
you
were
sitting
had
two
outer
doors
one
opened
on
the
main
road
to
andernach
which
skirts
the
rhine
in
front
of
the
inn
was
a
little
wharf
to
which
the
boat
hired
by
the
merchant
for
his
journey
was
moored
the
other
door
opened
upon
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
this
courtyard
was
surrounded
by
very
high
walls
and
was
full
for
the
time
being
of
cattle
and
horses
the
stables
being
occupied
by
human
beings
the
great
gate
leading
into
this
courtyard
had
been
so
carefully
barricaded
that
to
save
time
the
landlord
had
brought
the
merchant
and
sailors
into
the
public
room
through
the
door
opening
on
the
roadway
after
having
opened
the
window
as
requested
by
prosper
magnan
he
closed
this
door
slipped
the
iron
bars
into
their
places
and
ran
the
bolts
the
landlord
room
where
the
two
young
surgeons
were
to
sleep
adjoined
the
public
room
and
was
separated
by
a
somewhat
thin
partition
from
the
kitchen
where
the
landlord
and
his
wife
intended
probably
to
pass
the
night
the
had
left
the
premises
to
find
a
lodging
in
some
crib
or
hayloft
it
is
therefore
easy
to
see
that
the
kitchen
the
chamber
and
the
public
room
were
to
some
extent
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
house
in
the
courtyard
were
two
large
dogs
whose
barking
showed
vigilant
and
easily
roused
guardians
what
silence
and
what
a
beautiful
night
said
wilhelm
looking
at
the
sky
through
the
window
as
the
landlord
was
fastening
the
door
the
lapping
of
the
river
against
the
wharf
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
messieurs
said
the
merchant
permit
me
to
offer
you
a
few
bottles
of
wine
to
wash
down
the
carp
we
ease
the
fatigues
of
the
day
by
drinking
from
your
manner
and
the
state
of
your
clothes
i
judge
that
you
have
made
like
me
a
good
bit
of
a
journey
the
two
friends
accepted
and
the
landlord
went
out
by
a
door
through
the
kitchen
to
his
cellar
situated
no
doubt
under
this
portion
of
the
building
when
five
venerable
bottles
which
he
presently
brought
back
with
him
appeared
on
the
table
the
wife
brought
in
the
rest
of
the
supper
she
gave
to
the
dishes
and
to
the
room
generally
the
glance
of
a
mistress
and
then
sure
of
having
attended
to
all
the
wants
of
the
travellers
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
the
four
men
for
the
landlord
was
invited
to
drink
did
not
hear
her
go
to
bed
but
later
during
the
intervals
of
silence
which
came
into
their
talk
certain
strongly
accentuated
snores
made
the
more
sonorous
by
the
thin
planks
of
the
loft
in
which
she
had
ensconced
herself
made
the
guests
laugh
and
also
the
husband
towards
midnight
when
nothing
remained
on
the
table
but
biscuits
cheese
dried
fruit
and
good
wine
the
guests
chiefly
the
young
frenchmen
became
communicative
the
latter
talked
of
their
homes
their
studies
and
of
the
war
the
conversation
grew
lively
prosper
magnan
brought
a
few
tears
to
the
merchant
eyes
when
with
the
frankness
and
naivete
of
a
good
and
tender
nature
he
talked
of
what
his
mother
must
be
doing
at
that
hour
while
he
was
sitting
drinking
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
i
can
see
her
he
said
reading
her
prayers
before
she
goes
to
bed
she
wo
forget
me
she
is
certain
to
say
to
herself
poor
prosper
i
wonder
where
he
is
now
if
she
has
won
a
few
sous
from
her
neighbors
your
mother
perhaps
he
added
nudging
elbow
she
go
and
put
them
in
the
great
red
earthenware
pot
where
she
is
accumulating
a
sum
sufficient
to
buy
the
thirty
acres
adjoining
her
little
estate
at
lescheville
those
thirty
acres
are
worth
at
least
sixty
thousand
francs
such
fine
fields
ah
if
i
had
them
i
live
all
my
days
at
lescheville
without
other
ambition
how
my
father
used
to
long
for
those
thirty
acres
and
the
pretty
brook
which
winds
through
the
meadows
but
he
died
without
ever
being
able
to
buy
them
many
the
time
i
played
there
monsieur
wahlenfer
have
you
also
your
erat
in
votis
asked
wilhelm
yes
monsieur
but
it
came
to
pass
and
now
the
good
man
was
silent
and
did
not
finish
his
sentence
as
for
me
said
the
landlord
whose
face
was
rather
flushed
i
bought
a
field
last
spring
which
i
had
been
wanting
for
ten
years
they
talked
thus
like
men
whose
tongues
are
loosened
by
wine
and
they
each
took
that
friendly
liking
to
the
others
of
which
we
are
never
stingy
on
a
journey
so
that
when
the
time
came
to
separate
for
the
night
wilhelm
offered
his
bed
to
the
merchant
you
can
accept
it
without
hesitation
he
said
for
i
can
sleep
with
prosper
it
wo
be
the
first
nor
the
last
time
either
you
are
our
elder
and
we
ought
to
honor
age
bah
said
the
landlord
my
wife
bed
has
several
mattresses
take
one
off
and
put
it
on
the
floor
so
saying
he
went
and
shut
the
window
making
all
the
noise
that
prudent
operation
demanded
i
accept
said
the
merchant
in
fact
i
will
admit
he
added
lowering
his
voice
and
looking
at
the
two
frenchmen
that
i
desired
it
my
boatmen
seem
to
me
suspicious
i
am
not
sorry
to
spend
the
night
with
two
brave
young
men
two
french
soldiers
for
between
ourselves
i
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
gold
and
diamonds
in
my
valise
the
friendly
caution
with
which
this
imprudent
confidence
was
received
by
the
two
young
men
seemed
to
reassure
the
german
the
landlord
assisted
in
taking
off
one
of
the
mattresses
and
when
all
was
arranged
for
the
best
he
bade
them
and
went
off
to
bed
the
merchant
and
the
surgeons
laughed
over
the
nature
of
their
pillows
prosper
put
his
case
of
surgical
instruments
and
that
of
wilhelm
under
the
end
of
his
mattress
to
raise
it
and
supply
the
place
of
a
bolster
which
was
lacking
wahlenfer
as
a
measure
of
precaution
put
his
valise
under
his
pillow
we
shall
both
sleep
on
our
fortune
said
prosper
you
on
your
gold
i
on
my
instruments
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
my
instruments
will
ever
bring
me
the
gold
you
have
now
acquired
you
may
hope
so
said
the
merchant
work
and
honesty
can
do
everything
have
patience
however
wahlenfer
and
wilhelm
were
soon
asleep
whether
it
was
that
his
bed
on
the
floor
was
hard
or
that
his
great
fatigue
was
a
cause
of
sleeplessness
or
that
some
fatal
influence
affected
his
soul
it
is
certain
that
prosper
magnan
continued
awake
his
thoughts
unconsciously
took
an
evil
turn
his
mind
dwelt
exclusively
on
the
hundred
thousand
francs
which
lay
beneath
the
merchant
pillow
to
prosper
magnan
one
hundred
thousand
francs
was
a
vast
and
fortune
he
began
to
employ
it
in
a
hundred
different
ways
he
made
castles
in
the
air
such
as
we
all
make
with
eager
delight
during
the
moments
preceding
sleep
an
hour
when
images
rise
in
our
minds
confusedly
and
often
in
the
silence
of
the
night
thought
acquires
some
magical
power
he
gratified
his
mother
wishes
he
bought
the
thirty
acres
of
meadow
land
he
married
a
young
lady
of
beauvais
to
whom
his
present
want
of
fortune
forbade
him
to
aspire
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
he
planned
a
lifetime
of
happiness
he
saw
himself
prosperous
the
father
of
a
family
rich
respected
in
his
province
and
possibly
mayor
of
beauvais
his
brain
heated
he
searched
for
means
to
turn
his
fictions
to
realities
he
began
with
extraordinary
ardor
to
plan
a
crime
theoretically
while
fancying
the
death
of
the
merchant
he
saw
distinctly
the
gold
and
the
diamonds
his
eyes
were
dazzled
by
them
his
heart
throbbed
deliberation
was
undoubtedly
already
crime
fascinated
by
that
mass
of
gold
he
intoxicated
himself
morally
by
murderous
arguments
he
asked
himself
if
that
poor
german
had
any
need
to
live
he
supposed
the
case
of
his
never
having
existed
in
short
he
planned
the
crime
in
a
manner
to
secure
himself
impunity
the
other
bank
of
the
river
was
occupied
by
the
austrian
army
below
the
windows
lay
a
boat
and
boatman
he
would
cut
the
throat
of
that
man
throw
the
body
into
the
rhine
and
escape
with
the
valise
gold
would
buy
the
boatman
and
he
could
reach
the
austrians
he
went
so
far
as
to
calculate
the
professional
ability
he
had
reached
in
the
use
of
instruments
so
as
to
cut
through
his
throat
without
leaving
him
the
chance
for
a
single
cry
here
monsieur
taillefer
wiped
his
forehead
and
drank
a
little
water
prosper
rose
slowly
making
no
noise
certain
of
having
waked
no
one
he
dressed
himself
and
went
into
the
public
room
there
with
that
fatal
intelligence
a
man
suddenly
finds
on
some
occasions
within
him
with
that
power
of
tact
and
will
which
is
never
lacking
to
prisoners
or
to
criminals
in
whatever
they
undertake
he
unscrewed
the
iron
bars
slipped
them
from
their
places
without
the
slightest
noise
placed
them
against
the
wall
and
opened
the
shutters
leaning
heavily
upon
their
hinges
to
keep
them
from
creaking
the
moon
was
shedding
its
pale
pure
light
upon
the
scene
and
he
was
thus
enabled
to
faintly
see
into
the
room
where
wilhelm
and
wahlenfer
were
sleeping
there
he
told
me
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
the
throbbing
of
his
heart
was
so
strong
so
deep
so
sonorous
that
he
was
terrified
he
feared
he
could
not
act
with
coolness
his
hands
trembled
the
soles
of
his
feet
seem
planted
on
coal
but
the
execution
of
his
plan
was
accompanied
by
such
apparent
good
luck
that
he
fancied
he
saw
a
species
of
predestination
in
this
favor
bestowed
upon
him
by
fate
he
opened
the
window
returned
to
the
bedroom
took
his
case
of
instruments
and
selected
the
one
most
suitable
to
accomplish
the
crime
when
i
stood
by
the
bed
he
said
to
me
i
commended
myself
mechanically
to
god
at
the
moment
when
he
raised
his
arm
collecting
all
his
strength
he
heard
a
voice
as
it
were
within
him
he
thought
he
saw
a
light
he
flung
the
instrument
on
his
own
bed
and
fled
into
the
next
room
and
stood
before
the
window
there
he
conceived
the
utmost
horror
of
himself
feeling
his
virtue
weak
fearing
still
to
succumb
to
the
spell
that
was
upon
him
he
sprang
out
upon
the
road
and
walked
along
the
bank
of
the
rhine
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
sentinel
before
the
inn
sometimes
he
went
as
far
as
andernach
in
his
hurried
tramp
often
his
feet
led
him
up
the
slope
he
had
descended
on
his
way
to
the
inn
and
sometimes
he
lost
sight
of
the
inn
and
the
window
he
had
left
open
behind
him
his
object
he
said
was
to
weary
himself
and
so
find
sleep
but
as
he
walked
beneath
the
cloudless
skies
beholding
the
stars
affected
perhaps
by
the
purer
air
of
night
and
the
melancholy
lapping
of
the
water
he
fell
into
a
reverie
which
brought
him
back
by
degrees
to
sane
moral
thoughts
reason
at
last
dispersed
completely
his
momentary
frenzy
the
teachings
of
his
education
its
religious
precepts
but
above
all
so
he
told
me
the
remembrance
of
his
simple
life
beneath
the
parental
roof
drove
out
his
wicked
thoughts
when
he
returned
to
the
inn
after
a
long
meditation
to
which
he
abandoned
himself
on
the
bank
of
the
rhine
resting
his
elbow
on
a
rock
he
could
he
said
to
me
not
have
slept
but
have
watched
untempted
beside
millions
of
gold
at
the
moment
when
his
virtue
rose
proudly
and
vigorously
from
the
struggle
he
knelt
down
with
a
feeling
of
ecstasy
and
happiness
and
thanked
god
he
felt
happy
content
as
on
the
day
of
his
first
communion
when
he
thought
himself
worthy
of
the
angels
because
he
had
passed
one
day
without
sinning
in
thought
or
word
or
deed
he
returned
to
the
inn
and
closed
the
window
without
fearing
to
make
a
noise
and
went
to
bed
at
once
his
moral
and
physical
lassitude
was
certain
to
bring
him
sleep
in
a
very
short
time
after
laying
his
head
on
his
mattress
he
fell
into
that
first
fantastic
somnolence
which
precedes
the
deepest
sleep
the
senses
then
grew
numb
and
life
is
abolished
by
degrees
thoughts
are
incomplete
and
the
last
quivering
of
our
consciousness
seems
like
a
sort
of
reverie
how
heavy
the
air
is
he
thought
i
seem
to
be
breathing
a
moist
vapor
he
explained
this
vaguely
to
himself
by
the
difference
which
must
exist
between
the
atmosphere
of
the
close
room
and
the
purer
air
by
the
river
but
presently
he
heard
a
periodical
noise
something
like
that
made
by
drops
of
water
falling
from
a
robinet
into
a
fountain
obeying
a
feeling
of
panic
terror
he
was
about
to
rise
and
call
the
innkeeper
and
waken
wahlenfer
and
wilhelm
but
he
suddenly
remembered
alas
to
his
great
misfortune
the
tall
wooden
clock
he
fancied
the
sound
was
that
of
the
pendulum
and
he
fell
asleep
with
that
confused
and
indistinct
perception
do
you
want
some
water
monsieur
taillefer
said
the
master
of
the
house
observing
that
the
banker
was
mechanically
pouring
from
an
empty
decanter
monsieur
hermann
continued
his
narrative
after
the
slight
pause
occasioned
by
this
interruption
the
next
morning
prosper
magnan
was
awakened
by
a
great
noise
he
seemed
to
hear
piercing
cries
and
he
felt
that
violent
shuddering
of
the
nerves
which
we
suffer
when
on
awaking
we
continue
to
feel
a
painful
impression
begun
in
sleep
a
physiological
fact
then
takes
place
within
us
a
start
to
use
the
common
expression
which
has
never
been
sufficiently
observed
though
it
contains
very
curious
phenomena
for
science
this
terrible
agony
produced
possibly
by
the
too
sudden
reunion
of
our
two
natures
separated
during
sleep
is
usually
transient
but
in
the
poor
young
surgeon
case
it
lasted
and
even
increased
causing
him
suddenly
the
most
awful
horror
as
he
beheld
a
pool
of
blood
between
wahlenfer
bed
and
his
own
mattress
the
head
of
the
unfortunate
german
lay
on
the
ground
his
body
was
still
on
the
bed
all
its
blood
had
flowed
out
by
the
neck
seeing
the
eyes
still
open
but
fixed
seeing
the
blood
which
had
stained
his
sheets
and
even
his
hands
recognizing
his
own
surgical
instrument
beside
him
prosper
magnan
fainted
and
fell
into
the
pool
of
blood
it
was
he
said
to
me
the
punishment
of
my
thoughts
when
he
recovered
consciousness
he
was
in
the
public
room
seated
on
a
chair
surrounded
by
french
soldiers
and
in
presence
of
a
curious
and
observing
crowd
he
gazed
stupidly
at
a
republican
officer
engaged
in
taking
the
testimony
of
several
witnesses
and
in
writing
down
no
doubt
the
he
recognized
the
landlord
his
wife
the
two
boatmen
and
the
servant
of
the
red
inn
the
surgical
instrument
which
the
murderer
had
used
here
monsieur
taillefer
coughed
drew
out
his
handkerchief
to
blow
his
nose
and
wiped
his
forehead
these
perfectly
natural
motions
were
noticed
by
me
only
the
other
guests
sat
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
monsieur
hermann
to
whom
they
were
listening
with
a
sort
of
avidity
the
purveyor
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
put
his
head
into
his
right
hand
and
gazed
fixedly
at
hermann
from
that
moment
he
showed
no
other
sign
of
emotion
or
interest
but
his
face
remained
passive
and
ghastly
as
it
was
when
i
first
saw
him
playing
with
the
stopper
of
the
decanter
the
surgical
instrument
which
the
murderer
had
used
was
on
the
table
with
the
case
containing
the
rest
of
the
instruments
together
with
prosper
purse
and
papers
the
gaze
of
the
assembled
crowd
turned
alternately
from
these
convicting
articles
to
the
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
dying
and
whose
eyes
apparently
saw
nothing
a
confused
murmur
which
was
heard
without
proved
the
presence
of
a
crowd
drawn
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
inn
by
the
news
of
the
crime
and
also
perhaps
by
a
desire
to
see
the
murderer
the
step
of
the
sentries
placed
beneath
the
windows
of
the
public
room
and
the
rattle
of
their
accoutrements
could
be
heard
above
the
talk
of
the
populace
but
the
inn
was
closed
and
the
courtyard
was
empty
and
silent
incapable
of
sustaining
the
glance
of
the
officer
who
was
gathering
his
testimony
prosper
magnan
suddenly
felt
his
hand
pressed
by
a
man
and
he
raised
his
eyes
to
see
who
his
protector
could
be
in
that
crowd
of
enemies
he
recognized
by
his
uniform
the
of
the
then
stationed
at
andernach
the
glance
of
that
man
was
so
piercing
so
stern
that
the
poor
young
fellow
shuddered
and
suffered
his
head
to
fall
on
the
back
of
his
chair
a
soldier
put
vinegar
to
his
nostrils
and
he
recovered
consciousness
nevertheless
his
haggard
eyes
were
so
devoid
of
life
and
intelligence
that
the
surgeon
said
to
the
officer
after
feeling
prosper
pulse
captain
it
is
impossible
to
question
the
man
at
this
moment
very
well
take
him
away
replied
the
captain
interrupting
the
surgeon
and
addressing
a
corporal
who
stood
behind
the
prisoner
you
cursed
coward
he
went
on
speaking
to
prosper
in
a
low
voice
try
at
least
to
walk
firmly
before
these
german
curs
and
save
the
honor
of
the
republic
this
address
seemed
to
wake
up
prosper
magnan
who
rose
and
made
a
few
steps
forward
but
when
the
door
was
opened
and
he
felt
the
fresh
air
and
saw
the
crowd
before
him
he
staggered
and
his
knees
gave
way
under
him
this
coward
of
a
sawbones
deserves
a
dozen
deaths
get
on
cried
the
two
soldiers
who
had
him
in
charge
lending
him
their
arms
to
support
him
there
he
is
oh
the
villain
the
coward
here
he
is
there
he
is
these
cries
seemed
to
be
uttered
by
a
single
voice
the
tumultuous
voice
of
the
crowd
which
followed
him
with
insults
and
swelled
at
every
step
during
the
passage
from
the
inn
to
the
prison
the
noise
made
by
the
tramping
of
the
crowd
and
the
soldiers
the
murmur
of
the
various
colloquies
the
sight
of
the
sky
the
coolness
of
the
air
the
aspect
of
andernach
and
the
shimmering
of
the
waters
of
the
rhine
these
impressions
came
to
the
soul
of
the
young
man
vaguely
confusedly
torpidly
like
all
the
sensations
he
had
felt
since
his
waking
there
were
moments
he
said
when
he
thought
he
was
no
longer
living
i
was
then
in
prison
enthusiastic
as
we
all
are
at
twenty
years
of
age
i
wished
to
defend
my
country
and
i
commanded
a
company
of
free
lances
which
i
had
organized
in
the
vicinity
of
andernach
a
few
days
before
these
events
i
had
fallen
plump
during
the
night
into
a
french
detachment
of
eight
hundred
men
we
were
two
hundred
at
the
most
my
scouts
had
sold
me
i
was
thrown
into
the
prison
of
andernach
and
they
talked
of
shooting
me
as
a
warning
to
intimidate
others
the
french
talked
also
of
reprisals
my
father
however
obtained
a
reprieve
for
three
days
to
give
him
time
to
see
general
augereau
whom
he
knew
and
ask
for
my
pardon
which
was
granted
thus
it
happened
that
i
saw
prosper
magnan
when
he
was
brought
to
the
prison
he
inspired
me
with
the
profoundest
pity
though
pale
distracted
and
covered
with
blood
his
whole
countenance
had
a
character
of
truth
and
innocence
which
struck
me
forcibly
to
me
his
long
fair
hair
and
clear
blue
eyes
seemed
german
a
true
image
of
my
hapless
country
i
felt
he
was
a
victim
and
not
a
murderer
at
the
moment
when
he
passed
beneath
my
window
he
chanced
to
cast
about
him
the
painful
melancholy
smile
of
an
insane
man
who
suddenly
recovers
for
a
time
a
fleeting
gleam
of
reason
that
smile
was
assuredly
not
the
smile
of
a
murderer
when
i
saw
the
jailer
i
questioned
him
about
his
new
prisoner
he
has
not
spoken
since
i
put
him
in
his
cell
answered
the
man
he
is
sitting
down
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
is
either
sleeping
or
reflecting
about
his
crime
the
french
say
he
get
his
reckoning
morning
and
be
shot
in
hours
that
evening
i
stopped
short
under
the
window
of
the
prison
during
the
short
time
i
was
allowed
to
take
exercise
in
the
prison
yard
we
talked
together
and
he
frankly
related
to
me
his
strange
affair
replying
with
evident
truthfulness
to
my
various
questions
after
that
first
conversation
i
no
longer
doubted
his
innocence
i
asked
and
obtained
the
favor
of
staying
several
hours
with
him
i
saw
him
again
at
intervals
and
the
poor
lad
let
me
in
without
concealment
to
all
his
thoughts
he
believed
himself
both
innocent
and
guilty
remembering
the
horrible
temptation
which
he
had
had
the
strength
to
resist
he
feared
he
might
have
done
in
sleep
in
a
fit
of
somnambulism
the
crime
he
had
dreamed
of
awake
but
your
companion
i
said
to
him
oh
he
cried
eagerly
wilhelm
is
incapable
of
he
did
not
even
finish
his
sentence
at
that
warm
defence
so
full
of
youth
and
manly
virtue
i
pressed
his
hand
when
he
woke
continued
prosper
he
must
have
been
terrified
and
lost
his
head
no
doubt
he
fled
without
awaking
you
i
said
then
surely
your
defence
is
easy
wahlenfer
valise
can
not
have
been
stolen
suddenly
he
burst
into
tears
oh
yes
he
cried
i
am
innocent
i
have
not
killed
a
man
i
remember
my
dreams
i
was
playing
at
base
with
my
schoolmates
i
could
have
cut
off
the
head
of
a
man
while
i
dreamed
i
was
running
then
in
spite
of
these
gleams
of
hope
which
gave
him
at
times
some
calmness
he
felt
a
remorse
which
crushed
him
he
had
beyond
all
question
raised
his
arm
to
kill
that
man
he
judged
himself
and
he
felt
that
his
heart
was
not
innocent
after
committing
that
crime
in
his
mind
and
yet
i
good
he
cried
oh
my
poor
mother
perhaps
at
this
moment
she
is
cheerfully
playing
boston
with
the
neighbors
in
her
little
tapestry
salon
if
she
knew
that
i
had
raised
my
hand
to
murder
a
man
oh
she
would
die
of
it
and
i
in
prison
accused
of
committing
that
crime
if
i
have
not
killed
a
man
i
have
certainly
killed
my
mother
saying
these
words
he
wept
no
longer
he
was
seized
by
that
short
and
rapid
madness
known
to
the
men
of
picardy
he
sprang
to
the
wall
and
if
i
had
not
caught
him
he
would
have
dashed
out
his
brains
against
it
wait
for
your
trial
i
said
you
are
innocent
you
will
certainly
be
acquitted
think
of
your
mother
my
mother
he
cried
frantically
she
will
hear
of
the
accusation
before
she
hears
anything
else
it
is
always
so
in
little
towns
and
the
shock
will
kill
her
besides
i
am
not
innocent
must
i
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
feel
that
i
have
lost
the
virginity
of
my
conscience
after
that
terrible
avowal
he
sat
down
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
bowed
his
head
upon
it
gazing
gloomily
on
the
ground
at
this
instant
the
turnkey
came
to
ask
me
to
return
to
my
room
grieved
to
leave
my
companion
at
a
moment
when
his
discouragement
was
so
deep
i
pressed
him
in
my
arms
with
friendship
saying
have
patience
all
may
yet
go
well
if
the
voice
of
an
honest
man
can
still
your
doubts
believe
that
i
esteem
you
and
trust
you
accept
my
friendship
and
rest
upon
my
heart
if
you
can
not
find
peace
in
your
own
the
next
morning
a
corporal
guard
came
to
fetch
the
young
surgeon
at
nine
hearing
the
noise
made
by
the
soldiers
i
stationed
myself
at
my
window
as
the
prisoner
crossed
the
courtyard
he
cast
his
eyes
up
to
me
never
shall
i
forget
that
look
full
of
thoughts
presentiments
resignation
and
i
know
not
what
sad
melancholy
grace
it
was
as
it
were
a
silent
but
intelligible
last
will
by
which
a
man
bequeathed
his
lost
existence
to
his
only
friend
the
night
must
have
been
very
hard
very
solitary
for
him
and
yet
perhaps
the
pallor
of
his
face
expressed
a
stoicism
gathered
from
some
new
sense
of
perhaps
he
felt
that
his
remorse
had
purified
him
and
believed
that
he
had
blotted
out
his
fault
by
his
anguish
and
his
shame
he
now
walked
with
a
firm
step
and
since
the
previous
evening
he
had
washed
away
the
blood
with
which
he
was
involuntarily
stained
my
hands
must
have
dabbled
in
it
while
i
slept
for
i
am
always
a
restless
sleeper
he
had
said
to
me
in
tones
of
horrible
despair
i
learned
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
appear
before
the
council
of
war
the
division
was
to
march
on
the
following
morning
and
the
did
not
wish
to
leave
andernach
without
inquiry
into
the
crime
on
the
spot
where
it
had
been
committed
i
remained
in
the
utmost
anxiety
during
the
time
the
council
lasted
at
last
about
prosper
magnan
was
brought
back
i
was
then
taking
my
usual
walk
he
saw
me
and
came
and
threw
himself
into
my
arms
lost
he
said
lost
without
hope
here
to
all
the
world
i
am
a
murderer
he
raised
his
head
proudly
this
injustice
restores
to
me
my
innocence
my
life
would
always
have
been
wretched
my
death
leaves
me
without
reproach
but
is
there
a
future
the
whole
eighteenth
century
was
in
that
sudden
question
he
remained
thoughtful
tell
me
i
said
to
him
how
you
answered
what
did
they
ask
you
did
you
not
relate
the
simple
facts
as
you
told
them
to
me
he
looked
at
me
fixedly
for
a
moment
then
after
that
awful
pause
he
answered
with
feverish
excitement
first
they
asked
me
you
leave
the
inn
during
the
night
i
said
i
answered
the
window
you
must
have
taken
great
precautions
the
innkeeper
heard
no
noise
i
was
stupefied
the
sailors
said
they
saw
me
walking
first
to
andernach
then
to
the
forest
i
made
many
trips
they
said
no
doubt
to
bury
the
gold
and
diamonds
the
valise
had
not
been
found
my
remorse
still
held
me
dumb
when
i
wanted
to
speak
a
pitiless
voice
cried
out
to
me
meant
to
commit
that
crime
all
was
against
me
even
myself
they
asked
me
about
my
comrade
and
i
completely
exonerated
him
then
they
said
to
me
crime
must
lie
between
you
your
comrade
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
this
morning
all
the
windows
and
doors
were
found
securely
fastened
at
those
words
continued
the
poor
fellow
i
had
neither
voice
nor
strength
nor
soul
to
answer
more
sure
of
my
comrade
than
i
could
be
of
myself
i
could
not
accuse
him
i
saw
that
we
were
both
thought
equally
guilty
of
the
murder
and
that
i
was
considered
the
most
clumsy
i
tried
to
explain
the
crime
by
somnambulism
and
so
protect
my
friend
but
there
i
rambled
and
contradicted
myself
no
i
am
lost
i
read
my
condemnation
in
the
eyes
of
my
judges
they
smiled
incredulously
all
is
over
no
more
uncertainty
i
shall
be
shot
i
am
not
thinking
of
myself
he
went
on
after
a
pause
but
of
my
poor
mother
then
he
stopped
looked
up
to
heaven
and
shed
no
tears
his
eyes
were
dry
and
strongly
convulsed
frederic
ah
true
cried
monsieur
hermann
with
an
air
of
triumph
yes
the
other
name
was
frederic
frederic
i
remember
now
my
neighbor
touched
my
foot
and
made
me
a
sign
to
look
at
monsieur
taillefer
the
former
purveyor
had
negligently
dropped
his
hand
over
his
eyes
but
between
the
interstices
of
his
fingers
we
thought
we
caught
a
darkling
flame
proceeding
from
them
hein
she
said
in
my
ear
what
if
his
name
were
frederic
i
answered
with
a
glance
which
said
to
her
silence
hermann
continued
frederic
cried
the
young
surgeon
frederic
basely
deserted
me
he
must
have
been
afraid
perhaps
he
is
still
hidden
in
the
inn
for
our
horses
were
both
in
the
courtyard
this
morning
what
an
incomprehensible
mystery
he
went
on
after
a
moment
silence
somnambulism
somnambulism
i
never
had
but
one
attack
in
my
life
and
that
was
when
i
was
six
years
old
must
i
go
from
this
earth
he
cried
striking
the
ground
with
his
foot
carrying
with
me
all
there
is
of
friendship
in
the
world
shall
i
die
a
double
death
doubting
a
fraternal
love
begun
when
we
were
only
five
years
old
and
continued
through
school
and
college
where
is
frederic
he
wept
can
it
be
that
we
cling
more
to
a
sentiment
than
to
life
let
us
go
in
he
said
i
prefer
to
be
in
my
cell
i
do
not
wish
to
be
seen
weeping
i
shall
go
courageously
to
death
but
i
can
not
play
the
heroic
at
all
moments
i
own
i
regret
my
beautiful
young
life
all
last
night
i
could
not
sleep
i
remembered
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
i
fancied
i
was
running
in
the
fields
ah
i
had
a
future
he
said
suddenly
interrupting
himself
and
now
twelve
men
a
shouting
aim
fire
a
roll
of
drums
and
infamy
that
my
future
now
oh
there
must
be
a
god
or
it
would
all
be
too
senseless
then
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
pressed
me
to
him
with
all
his
strength
you
are
the
last
man
the
last
friend
to
whom
i
can
show
my
soul
you
will
be
set
at
liberty
you
will
see
your
mother
i
do
know
whether
you
are
rich
or
poor
but
no
matter
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
they
wo
fight
always
well
when
there
peace
will
you
go
to
beauvais
if
my
mother
has
survived
the
fatal
news
of
my
death
you
will
find
her
there
say
to
her
the
comforting
words
was
innocent
she
will
believe
you
i
am
going
to
write
to
her
but
you
must
take
her
my
last
look
you
must
tell
her
that
you
were
the
last
man
whose
hand
i
pressed
oh
she
love
you
the
poor
woman
you
my
last
friend
here
he
said
after
a
moment
silence
during
which
he
was
overcome
by
the
weight
of
his
recollections
all
officers
and
soldiers
are
unknown
to
me
i
am
an
object
of
horror
to
them
if
it
were
not
for
you
my
innocence
would
be
a
secret
between
god
and
myself
i
swore
to
sacredly
fulfil
his
last
wishes
my
words
the
emotion
i
showed
touched
him
soon
after
that
the
soldiers
came
to
take
him
again
before
the
council
of
war
he
was
condemned
to
death
i
am
ignorant
of
the
formalities
that
followed
or
accompanied
this
judgment
nor
do
i
know
whether
the
young
surgeon
defended
his
life
or
not
but
he
expected
to
be
executed
on
the
following
day
and
he
spent
the
night
in
writing
to
his
mother
we
shall
both
be
free
he
said
smiling
when
i
went
to
see
him
the
next
morning
i
am
told
that
the
general
has
signed
your
pardon
i
was
silent
and
looked
at
him
closely
so
as
to
carve
his
features
as
it
were
on
my
memory
presently
an
expression
of
disgust
crossed
his
face
i
have
been
very
cowardly
he
said
during
all
last
night
i
begged
for
mercy
of
these
walls
and
he
pointed
to
the
sides
of
his
dungeon
yes
yes
i
howled
with
despair
i
rebelled
i
suffered
the
most
awful
moral
agony
i
was
alone
now
i
think
of
what
others
will
say
of
me
courage
is
a
garment
to
put
on
i
desire
to
go
decently
to
death
therefore
a
double
retribution
oh
stop
stop
cried
the
young
lady
who
had
asked
for
this
history
interrupting
the
narrator
suddenly
say
no
more
let
me
remain
in
uncertainty
and
believe
that
he
was
saved
if
i
hear
now
that
he
was
shot
i
shall
not
sleep
all
night
you
shall
tell
me
the
rest
we
rose
from
table
my
neighbor
in
accepting
monsieur
hermann
arm
said
to
him
i
suppose
he
was
shot
was
he
not
yes
i
was
present
at
the
execution
oh
monsieur
she
said
how
could
you
he
desired
it
madame
there
was
something
really
dreadful
in
following
the
funeral
of
a
living
man
a
man
my
heart
cared
for
an
innocent
man
the
poor
young
fellow
never
ceased
to
look
at
me
he
seemed
to
live
only
in
me
he
wanted
he
said
that
i
should
carry
to
his
mother
his
last
sigh
and
did
you
at
the
peace
of
amiens
i
went
to
france
for
the
purpose
of
taking
to
the
mother
those
blessed
words
was
innocent
i
religiously
undertook
that
pilgrimage
but
madame
magnan
had
died
of
consumption
it
was
not
without
deep
emotion
that
i
burned
the
letter
of
which
i
was
the
bearer
you
will
perhaps
smile
at
my
german
imagination
but
i
see
a
drama
of
sad
sublimity
in
the
eternal
secrecy
which
engulfed
those
parting
words
cast
between
two
graves
unknown
to
all
creation
like
the
cry
uttered
in
a
desert
by
some
lonely
traveller
whom
a
lion
seizes
and
if
i
said
interrupting
him
you
were
brought
face
to
face
with
a
man
now
in
this
room
and
were
told
is
the
murderer
would
not
that
be
another
drama
and
what
would
you
do
monsieur
hermann
looked
for
his
hat
and
went
away
you
are
behaving
like
a
young
man
and
very
heedlessly
said
my
neighbor
look
at
taillefer
there
seated
on
that
sofa
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
mademoiselle
fanny
is
offering
him
a
cup
of
coffee
he
smiles
would
a
murderer
to
whom
that
tale
must
have
been
torture
present
so
calm
a
face
is
his
whole
air
patriarchal
yes
but
go
and
ask
him
if
he
went
to
the
war
in
germany
i
said
why
not
and
with
that
audacity
which
is
seldom
lacking
to
women
when
some
action
attracts
them
or
their
minds
are
impelled
by
curiosity
my
neighbor
went
up
to
the
purveyor
were
you
ever
in
germany
she
asked
taillefer
came
near
dropping
his
cup
and
saucer
i
madame
no
never
what
are
you
talking
about
taillefer
said
our
host
interrupting
him
were
you
not
in
the
commissariat
during
the
campaign
of
wagram
ah
true
replied
taillefer
i
was
there
at
that
time
you
are
mistaken
said
my
neighbor
returning
to
my
side
that
a
good
man
well
i
cried
before
the
end
of
this
evening
i
will
hunt
that
murderer
out
of
the
slough
in
which
he
is
hiding
every
day
before
our
eyes
a
moral
phenomenon
of
amazing
profundity
takes
place
which
is
nevertheless
so
simple
as
never
to
be
noticed
if
two
men
meet
in
a
salon
one
of
whom
has
the
right
to
hate
or
despise
the
other
whether
from
a
knowledge
of
some
private
and
latent
fact
which
degrades
him
or
of
a
secret
condition
or
even
of
a
coming
revenge
those
two
men
divine
each
other
souls
and
are
able
to
measure
the
gulf
which
separates
or
ought
to
separate
them
they
observe
each
other
unconsciously
their
minds
are
preoccupied
by
themselves
through
their
looks
their
gestures
an
indefinable
emanation
of
their
thought
transpires
there
a
magnet
between
them
i
do
know
which
has
the
strongest
power
of
attraction
vengeance
or
crime
hatred
or
insult
like
a
priest
who
can
not
consecrate
the
host
in
presence
of
an
evil
spirit
each
is
ill
at
ease
and
distrustful
one
is
polite
the
other
surly
but
i
know
not
which
one
colors
or
turns
pale
the
other
trembles
often
the
avenger
is
as
cowardly
as
the
victim
few
men
have
the
courage
to
invoke
an
evil
even
when
just
or
necessary
and
men
are
silent
or
forgive
a
wrong
from
hatred
of
uproar
or
fear
of
some
tragic
ending
this
introsusception
of
our
souls
and
our
sentiments
created
a
mysterious
struggle
between
taillefer
and
myself
since
the
first
inquiry
i
had
put
to
him
during
monsieur
hermann
narrative
he
had
steadily
avoided
my
eye
possibly
he
avoided
those
of
all
the
other
guests
he
talked
with
the
youthful
inexperienced
daughter
of
the
banker
feeling
no
doubt
like
many
other
criminals
a
need
of
drawing
near
to
innocence
hoping
to
find
rest
there
but
though
i
was
a
long
distance
from
him
i
heard
him
and
my
piercing
eye
fascinated
his
when
he
thought
he
could
watch
me
unobserved
our
eyes
met
and
his
eyelids
dropped
immediately
weary
of
this
torture
taillefer
seemed
determined
to
put
an
end
to
it
by
sitting
down
at
a
i
at
once
went
to
bet
on
his
adversary
hoping
to
lose
my
money
the
wish
was
granted
the
player
left
the
table
and
i
took
his
place
face
to
face
with
the
murderer
monsieur
i
said
while
he
dealt
the
cards
may
i
ask
if
you
are
monsieur
frederic
taillefer
whose
family
i
know
very
well
at
beauvais
yes
monsieur
he
answered
he
dropped
the
cards
turned
pale
put
his
hands
to
his
head
and
rose
asking
one
of
the
bettors
to
take
his
hand
it
is
too
hot
here
he
cried
i
fear
he
did
not
end
the
sentence
his
face
expressed
intolerable
suffering
and
he
went
out
hastily
the
master
of
the
house
followed
him
and
seemed
to
take
an
anxious
interest
in
his
condition
my
neighbor
and
i
looked
at
each
other
but
i
saw
a
tinge
of
bitter
sadness
or
reproach
upon
her
countenance
do
you
think
your
conduct
is
merciful
she
asked
drawing
me
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
just
as
i
was
leaving
the
having
lost
all
my
money
would
you
accept
the
power
of
reading
hearts
why
not
leave
things
to
human
justice
or
divine
justice
we
may
escape
one
but
we
can
not
escape
the
other
do
you
think
the
privilege
of
a
judge
of
the
court
of
assizes
so
much
to
be
envied
you
have
almost
done
the
work
of
an
executioner
after
sharing
and
stimulating
my
curiosity
why
are
you
now
lecturing
me
on
morality
you
have
made
me
reflect
she
answered
so
then
peace
to
villains
war
to
the
sorrowful
and
let
deify
gold
however
we
will
drop
the
subject
i
added
laughing
do
you
see
that
young
girl
who
is
just
entering
the
salon
yes
what
of
her
i
met
her
three
days
ago
at
the
ball
of
the
neapolitan
ambassador
and
i
am
passionately
in
love
with
her
for
pity
sake
tell
me
her
name
no
one
was
able
that
is
mademoiselle
victorine
taillefer
i
grew
dizzy
her
continued
my
neighbor
has
lately
taken
her
from
a
convent
where
she
was
finishing
rather
late
in
the
day
her
education
for
a
long
time
her
father
refused
to
recognize
her
she
comes
here
for
the
first
time
she
is
very
beautiful
and
very
rich
these
words
were
accompanied
by
a
sardonic
smile
at
this
moment
we
heard
violent
but
smothered
outcries
they
seemed
to
come
from
a
neighboring
apartment
and
to
be
echoed
faintly
back
through
the
garden
is
that
the
voice
of
monsieur
taillefer
i
said
we
gave
our
full
attention
to
the
noise
a
frightful
moaning
reached
our
ears
the
wife
of
the
banker
came
hurriedly
towards
us
and
closed
the
window
let
us
avoid
a
scene
she
said
if
mademoiselle
taillefer
hears
her
father
she
might
be
thrown
into
hysterics
the
banker
now
the
salon
looked
round
for
victorine
and
said
a
few
words
in
her
ear
instantly
the
young
girl
uttered
a
cry
ran
to
the
door
and
disappeared
this
event
produced
a
great
sensation
the
paused
every
one
questioned
his
neighbor
the
murmur
of
voices
swelled
and
groups
gathered
can
monsieur
taillefer
be
i
dead
said
my
sarcastic
neighbor
you
would
wear
the
gayest
mourning
i
fancy
but
what
has
happened
to
him
the
poor
dear
man
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
subject
to
attacks
of
a
disease
the
name
of
which
i
never
can
remember
though
monsieur
brousson
has
often
told
it
to
me
and
he
has
just
been
seized
with
one
what
is
the
nature
of
the
disease
asked
an
oh
it
is
something
terrible
monsieur
she
replied
the
doctors
know
no
remedy
it
causes
the
most
dreadful
suffering
one
day
while
the
unfortunate
man
was
staying
at
my
he
had
an
attack
and
i
was
obliged
to
go
away
and
stay
with
a
neighbor
to
avoid
hearing
him
his
cries
were
terrible
he
tried
to
kill
himself
his
daughter
was
obliged
to
have
him
put
into
a
and
fastened
to
his
bed
the
poor
man
declares
there
are
live
animals
in
his
head
gnawing
his
brain
every
nerve
quivers
with
horrible
shooting
pains
and
he
writhes
in
torture
he
suffers
so
much
in
his
head
that
he
did
not
even
feel
the
moxas
they
used
formerly
to
apply
to
relieve
it
but
monsieur
brousson
who
is
now
his
physician
has
forbidden
that
remedy
declaring
that
the
trouble
is
a
nervous
affection
an
inflammation
of
the
nerves
for
which
leeches
should
be
applied
to
the
neck
and
opium
to
the
head
as
a
result
the
attacks
are
not
so
frequent
they
appear
now
only
about
once
a
year
and
always
late
in
the
autumn
when
he
recovers
taillefer
says
repeatedly
that
he
would
far
rather
die
than
endure
such
torture
then
he
must
suffer
terribly
said
a
broker
considered
a
wit
who
was
present
oh
continued
the
mistress
of
the
house
last
year
he
nearly
died
in
one
of
these
attacks
he
had
gone
alone
to
his
on
pressing
business
for
want
perhaps
of
immediate
help
he
lay
hours
stiff
and
stark
as
though
he
were
dead
a
very
hot
bath
was
all
that
saved
him
it
must
be
a
species
of
lockjaw
said
one
of
the
guests
i
do
know
she
answered
he
got
the
disease
in
the
army
nearly
thirty
years
ago
he
says
it
was
caused
by
a
splinter
of
wood
entering
his
head
from
a
shot
on
board
a
boat
brousson
hopes
to
cure
him
they
say
the
english
have
discovered
a
mode
of
treating
the
disease
with
prussic
acid
at
that
instant
a
still
more
piercing
cry
echoed
through
the
house
and
froze
us
with
horror
there
that
is
what
i
listened
to
all
day
long
last
year
said
the
banker
wife
it
made
me
jump
in
my
chair
and
rasped
my
nerves
dreadfully
but
strange
to
say
poor
taillefer
though
he
suffers
untold
agony
is
in
no
danger
of
dying
he
eats
and
drinks
as
well
as
ever
during
even
short
cessations
of
the
pain
nature
is
so
queer
a
german
doctor
told
him
it
was
a
form
of
gout
in
the
head
and
that
agrees
with
brousson
opinion
i
left
the
group
around
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
went
away
on
the
staircase
i
met
mademoiselle
taillefer
whom
a
footman
had
come
to
fetch
oh
she
said
to
me
weeping
what
has
my
poor
father
ever
done
to
deserve
such
suffering
so
kind
as
he
is
i
accompanied
her
downstairs
and
assisted
her
in
getting
into
the
carriage
and
there
i
saw
her
father
bent
almost
double
mademoiselle
taillefer
tried
to
stifle
his
moans
by
putting
her
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
unhappily
he
saw
me
his
face
became
even
more
distorted
a
convulsive
cry
rent
the
air
and
he
gave
me
a
dreadful
look
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
that
dinner
that
evening
exercised
a
cruel
influence
on
my
life
and
on
my
feelings
i
loved
mademoiselle
taillefer
precisely
perhaps
because
honor
and
decency
forbade
me
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
murderer
however
good
a
husband
and
father
he
might
be
a
curious
fatality
impelled
me
to
visit
those
houses
where
i
knew
i
could
meet
victorine
often
after
giving
myself
my
word
of
honor
to
renounce
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
i
found
myself
that
same
evening
beside
her
my
struggles
were
great
legitimate
love
full
of
chimerical
remorse
assumed
the
color
of
a
criminal
passion
i
despised
myself
for
bowing
to
taillefer
when
by
chance
he
accompanied
his
daughter
but
i
bowed
to
him
all
the
same
alas
for
my
misfortune
victorine
is
not
only
a
pretty
girl
she
is
also
educated
intelligent
full
of
talent
and
of
charm
without
the
slightest
pedantry
or
the
faintest
tinge
of
assumption
she
converses
with
reserve
and
her
nature
has
a
melancholy
grace
which
no
one
can
resist
she
loves
me
or
at
least
she
lets
me
think
so
she
has
a
certain
smile
which
she
keeps
for
me
alone
for
me
her
voice
grows
softer
still
oh
yes
she
loves
me
but
she
adores
her
father
she
tells
me
of
his
kindness
his
gentleness
his
excellent
qualities
those
praises
are
so
many
with
which
she
stabs
me
to
the
heart
one
day
i
came
near
making
myself
the
accomplice
as
it
were
of
the
crime
which
led
to
the
opulence
of
the
taillefer
family
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
the
father
for
victorine
hand
but
i
fled
i
travelled
i
went
to
germany
to
andernach
and
then
i
returned
i
found
victorine
pale
and
thinner
if
i
had
seen
her
well
in
health
and
gay
i
should
certainly
have
been
saved
instead
of
which
my
love
burst
out
again
with
untold
violence
fearing
that
my
scruples
might
degenerate
into
monomania
i
resolved
to
convoke
a
sanhedrim
of
sound
consciences
and
obtain
from
them
some
light
on
this
problem
of
high
morality
and
philosophy
a
problem
which
had
been
as
we
shall
see
still
further
complicated
since
my
return
two
days
ago
therefore
i
collected
those
of
my
friends
to
whom
i
attribute
most
delicacy
probity
and
honor
i
invited
two
englishmen
the
secretary
of
an
embassy
and
a
puritan
a
former
minister
now
a
mature
statesman
a
priest
an
old
man
also
my
former
guardian
a
being
who
rendered
so
loyal
a
guardianship
account
that
the
memory
of
it
is
still
green
at
the
palais
besides
these
there
were
present
a
judge
a
lawyer
and
a
notary
in
short
all
social
opinions
and
all
practical
virtues
we
began
by
dining
well
talking
well
and
making
some
noise
then
at
dessert
i
related
my
history
candidly
and
asked
for
advice
concealing
of
course
the
taillefer
name
a
profound
silence
suddenly
fell
upon
the
company
then
the
notary
took
leave
he
had
he
said
a
deed
to
draw
the
wine
and
the
good
dinner
had
reduced
my
former
guardian
to
silence
in
fact
i
was
obliged
later
in
the
evening
to
put
him
under
guardianship
to
make
sure
of
no
mishap
to
him
on
his
way
home
i
understand
i
cried
by
not
giving
an
opinion
you
tell
me
energetically
enough
what
i
ought
to
do
on
this
there
came
a
stir
throughout
the
assembly
a
capitalist
who
had
subscribed
for
the
children
and
tomb
of
general
foy
exclaimed
like
virtue
self
a
crime
has
its
degrees
rash
tongue
said
the
former
minister
in
a
low
voice
nudging
me
with
his
elbow
where
your
difficulty
asked
a
duke
whose
fortune
is
derived
from
the
estates
of
stubborn
protestants
confiscated
on
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
the
lawyer
rose
and
said
in
law
the
case
submitted
to
us
presents
no
difficulty
monsieur
le
duc
is
right
cried
the
legal
organ
there
are
time
limitations
where
should
we
all
be
if
we
had
to
search
into
the
origin
of
fortunes
this
is
simply
an
affair
of
conscience
if
you
must
absolutely
carry
the
case
before
some
tribunal
go
to
that
of
the
confessional
the
code
incarnate
ceased
speaking
sat
down
and
drank
a
glass
of
champagne
the
man
charged
with
the
duty
of
explaining
the
gospel
the
good
priest
rose
god
has
made
us
all
frail
beings
he
said
firmly
if
you
love
the
heiress
of
that
crime
marry
her
but
content
yourself
with
the
property
she
derives
from
her
mother
give
that
of
the
father
to
the
poor
but
cried
one
of
those
pitiless
who
are
often
to
be
met
with
in
the
world
perhaps
the
father
could
make
a
rich
marriage
only
because
he
was
rich
himself
consequently
the
marriage
was
the
fruit
of
the
crime
this
discussion
is
in
itself
a
verdict
there
are
some
things
on
which
a
man
does
not
deliberate
said
my
former
guardian
who
thought
to
enlighten
the
assembly
with
a
flash
of
inebriety
yes
said
the
secretary
of
an
embassy
yes
said
the
priest
but
the
two
men
did
not
mean
the
same
thing
a
doctrinaire
who
had
missed
his
election
to
the
chamber
by
one
hundred
and
fifty
votes
out
of
one
hundred
and
here
rose
messieurs
he
said
this
phenomenal
incident
of
intellectual
nature
is
one
of
those
which
stand
out
vividly
from
the
normal
condition
to
which
sobriety
is
subjected
consequently
the
decision
to
be
made
ought
to
be
the
spontaneous
act
of
our
consciences
a
sudden
conception
a
prompt
inward
verdict
a
fugitive
shadow
of
our
mental
apprehension
much
like
the
flashes
of
sentiment
which
constitute
taste
let
us
vote
let
us
vote
cried
all
my
guests
i
have
each
two
balls
one
white
one
red
the
white
symbol
of
virginity
was
to
forbid
the
marriage
the
red
ball
sanctioned
it
i
myself
abstained
from
voting
out
of
delicacy
my
friends
were
seventeen
in
number
nine
was
therefore
the
majority
each
man
put
his
ball
into
the
wicker
basket
with
a
narrow
throat
used
to
hold
the
numbered
balls
when
draw
for
their
places
at
pool
we
were
all
roused
to
a
more
or
less
keen
curiosity
for
this
balloting
to
clarify
morality
was
certainly
original
inspection
of
the
showed
the
presence
of
nine
white
balls
the
result
did
not
surprise
me
but
it
came
into
my
heard
to
count
the
young
men
of
my
own
age
whom
i
had
brought
to
sit
in
judgment
these
casuists
were
precisely
nine
in
number
they
all
had
the
same
thought
oh
oh
i
said
to
myself
here
is
secret
unanimity
to
forbid
the
marriage
and
secret
unanimity
to
sanction
it
how
shall
i
solve
that
problem
where
does
the
live
asked
one
my
heedlessly
being
less
sophisticated
than
the
others
there
no
longer
a
i
replied
hitherto
my
conscience
has
spoken
plainly
enough
to
make
your
verdict
superfluous
if
its
voice
is
weakened
here
is
the
cause
of
my
cowardice
i
received
about
two
months
ago
this
letter
and
i
showed
them
the
following
invitation
which
i
took
from
my
you
are
invited
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
procession
burial
services
and
interment
of
monsieur
taillefer
of
the
house
of
taillefer
and
company
formerly
purveyor
of
in
his
lifetime
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
of
the
golden
spur
captain
of
the
first
company
of
the
grenadiers
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
deceased
may
at
his
residence
rue
joubert
which
will
take
place
at
etc
on
the
part
of
etc
now
what
am
i
do
to
i
continued
i
will
put
the
question
before
you
in
a
broad
way
there
is
undoubtedly
a
sea
of
blood
in
mademoiselle
taillefer
estates
her
inheritance
from
her
father
is
a
vast
aceldama
i
know
that
prosper
magnan
left
no
heirs
again
i
have
been
unable
to
discover
the
family
of
the
merchant
who
was
murdered
at
andernach
to
whom
therefore
can
i
restore
that
fortune
and
ought
it
to
be
wholly
restored
have
i
the
right
to
betray
a
secret
surprised
by
me
to
add
a
murdered
head
to
the
dowry
of
an
innocent
girl
to
give
her
for
the
rest
of
her
life
bad
dreams
to
deprive
her
of
all
her
illusions
and
say
gold
is
stained
with
blood
i
have
borrowed
the
of
cases
of
conscience
from
an
old
ecclesiastic
but
i
can
find
nothing
there
to
solve
my
doubts
shall
i
found
pious
masses
for
the
repose
of
the
souls
of
prosper
magnan
wahlenfer
and
taillefer
here
we
are
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
shall
i
build
a
hospital
or
institute
a
prize
for
virtue
a
prize
for
virtue
would
be
given
to
scoundrels
and
as
for
hospitals
they
seem
to
me
to
have
become
in
these
days
the
protectors
of
vice
besides
such
charitable
actions
more
or
less
profitable
to
vanity
do
they
constitute
reparation
and
to
whom
do
i
owe
reparation
but
i
love
i
love
passionately
my
love
is
my
life
if
i
without
apparent
motive
suggest
to
a
young
girl
accustomed
to
luxury
to
elegance
to
a
life
fruitful
of
all
enjoyments
of
art
a
young
girl
who
loves
to
idly
listen
at
the
opera
to
rossini
music
if
to
her
i
should
propose
that
she
deprive
herself
of
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
in
favor
of
old
men
or
scrofulous
paupers
she
would
turn
her
back
on
me
and
laugh
or
her
confidential
friend
would
tell
her
that
i
a
crazy
jester
if
in
an
ecstasy
of
love
i
should
paint
to
her
the
charms
of
a
modest
life
and
a
little
home
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
if
i
were
to
ask
her
to
sacrifice
her
parisian
life
on
the
altar
of
our
love
it
would
be
in
the
first
place
a
virtuous
lie
in
the
next
i
might
only
be
opening
the
way
to
some
painful
experience
i
might
lose
the
heart
of
a
girl
who
loves
society
and
balls
and
personal
adornment
and
for
the
time
being
some
slim
and
jaunty
officer
with
a
moustache
who
can
play
the
piano
quote
lord
byron
and
ride
a
horse
elegantly
may
get
her
away
from
me
what
shall
i
do
for
heaven
sake
give
me
some
advice
the
honest
man
that
species
of
puritan
not

the

already
told

up

the
