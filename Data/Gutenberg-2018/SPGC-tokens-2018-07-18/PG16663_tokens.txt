solomon

sat
up
and

the
tale
of
solomon
owl
i
scaring
johnny
green
when
johnnie
green
was
younger
it
always
scared
him
to
hear
solomon
owl
s
voice
calling
in
the
woods
after
dark
that
weird
cry
was
enough
to
send
johnnie
green
hurrying
into
the
farmhouse
though
sometimes
he
paused
in
the
doorway
to
if
solomon
owl
happened
to
be
laughing
his
booming
across
the
meadow
on
a
crisp
fall
evening
when
the
big
yellow
moon
hung
over
the
fields
of
and
pumpkins
sounded
almost
as
if
solomon
were
laughing
at
the
little
boy
he
had
frightened
there
was
certainly
a
mocking
jeering
note
in
his
laughter
of
course
as
he
grew
older
johnnie
green
no
longer
shivered
on
hearing
solomon
s
rolling
call
when
solomon
laughed
johnnie
green
would
laugh
too
but
solomon
owl
never
knew
that
for
often
he
was
half
a
mile
from
the
farm
buildings
a
hoot
owl
johnnie
green
termed
him
and
anyone
who
heard
solomon
hooting
of
an
evening
or
just
before
sunrise
would
have
agreed
that
it
was
a
good
name
for
him
but
he
was
really
a
owl
for
he
had
bars
of
white
across
his
feathers
if
you
had
happened
to
catch
solomon
owl
resting
among
the
thick
hemlocks
near
the
foot
of
blue
mountain
where
he
lived
you
would
have
thought
that
he
looked
strangely
like
a
human
being
he
had
no
horns
or
such
as
some
of
the
other
owls
wore
and
his
great
pale
face
with
its
black
eyes
made
him
seem
very
wise
and
solemn
in
spite
of
the
mild
questioning
look
upon
his
face
whenever
anyone
surprised
him
in
the
daytime
solomon
owl
was
the
noisiest
of
all
the
different
families
of
owls
in
pleasant
valley
there
were
the
barn
owls
the
owls
the
owls
the
owls
the
screech
there
there
s
no
use
of
naming
them
all
there
wasn
t
one
of
them
that
could
equal
solomon
owl
s
laughing
and
hooting
and
shrieking
and
night
during
the
day
however
solomon
owl
he
was
quiet
about
it
one
reason
for
his
silence
then
was
that
he
generally
slept
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
when
most
people
were
sleeping
solomon
owl
was
as
wide
awake
as
he
could
be
he
was
a
ever
there
was
one
and
he
could
see
a
mouse
on
the
darkest
night
even
if
it
stirred
ever
so
slightly
that
was
unfortunate
for
the
mice
but
luckily
for
them
solomon
owl
couldn
t
be
in
more
than
one
place
at
a
time
otherwise
there
wouldn
t
have
been
a
mouse
left
in
pleasant
he
could
have
had
way
and
though
he
didn
t
help
the
mice
he
helped
farmer
green
by
catching
them
if
he
did
take
a
fat
pullet
once
in
a
while
it
is
certain
that
he
more
than
paid
for
it
so
on
the
whole
farmer
green
did
not
and
for
a
long
time
solomon
raised
no
objection
to
farmer
green
s
living
near
swift
river
but
later
solomon
owl
claimed
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
forest
folk
if
they
could
get
rid
of
the
whole
green
the
hired
man
too
ii
a
newcomer
upon
his
arrival
as
a
stranger
in
pleasant
valley
solomon
owl
looked
about
carefully
for
a
place
to
live
what
he
wanted
especially
was
a
good
hole
for
he
thought
that
sunshine
was
very
dismal
though
he
was
willing
to
bestir
himself
enough
to
suit
anybody
when
it
came
to
solomon
owl
did
not
like
to
work
he
was
no
busy
like
rusty
wren
in
his
search
for
a
house
he
looked
several
times
at
the
home
of
old
crow
if
it
had
suited
him
better
solomon
would
not
have
hesitated
to
take
that
it
was
altogether
to
please
him
that
was
lucky
for
old
crow
and
the
black
rascal
knew
it
too
he
had
noticed
that
solomon
owl
was
hanging
about
the
neighborhood
and
several
times
he
caught
solomon
examining
his
nest
but
crow
did
not
have
to
worry
long
for
as
it
happened
solomon
owl
at
last
found
exactly
what
he
wanted
in
an
old
hollow
hemlock
he
came
across
a
cozy
dark
cavity
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
he
knew
that
it
was
the
very
thing
so
he
moved
in
at
once
and
except
for
the
time
that
he
spent
in
the
was
considerably
lived
there
for
a
good
many
years
once
fatty
coon
thought
that
he
would
drive
solomon
out
of
his
snug
house
and
live
in
it
himself
but
he
soon
changed
solomon
fatty
sharp
strong
claws
and
a
sharp
strong
beak
as
well
which
curled
over
his
face
in
a
cruel
hook
it
was
really
a
good
thing
for
solomon
fight
he
had
with
fatty
coon
for
afterward
his
neighbors
seldom
troubled
when
jasper
jay
brought
a
crowd
of
his
noisy
friends
to
tease
solomon
or
reddy
woodpecker
annoyed
him
by
rapping
on
his
door
when
he
was
asleep
but
those
rowdies
always
took
good
care
to
skip
out
of
solomon
s
reach
and
when
jasper
jay
met
solomon
alone
in
the
woods
at
dawn
or
dusk
he
was
most
polite
to
the
solemn
old
chap
it
was
owl
and
i
hope
you
re
well
and
when
solomon
jasper
that
bold
fellow
always
felt
quite
uneasy
and
he
was
glad
when
solomon
owl
looked
away
if
solomon
owl
chanced
to
on
those
occasions
jasper
jay
would
jump
almost
out
of
his
bright
blue
coat
then
solomon
s
deep
laughter
would
echo
mockingly
through
the
woods
you
see
though
not
nearly
so
wise
as
he
appeared
solomon
owl
knew
well
enough
how
to
frighten
some
people
iii
solomon
likes
frogs
it
was
a
warm
summer
s
warm
that
frog
the
tailor
had
taken
his
sewing
outside
his
tailor
s
shop
and
seated
himself
upon
the
bank
of
the
brook
where
he
sang
and
sewed
without
to
take
a
swim
now
and
then
in
the
cool
water
to
stretch
his
legs
as
he
claimed
he
was
making
a
new
suit
of
blue
clothes
for
jasper
jay
and
since
jasper
was
a
great
dandy
and
very
particular
frog
was
taking
special
pains
with
his
sewing
usually
he
did
his
work
quickly
but
now
after
every
five
stitches
that
he
put
into
his
work
he
stopped
to
take
out
ten
and
naturally
he
was
not
getting
on
very
fast
he
had
been
working
busily
since
early
morning
and
jasper
jay
s
suit
was
further
than
ever
from
being
finished
since
he
was
a
most
cheerful
person
frog
did
not
mind
that
indeed
he
was
more
than
pleased
because
the
oftener
he
took
a
swim
the
fewer
stitches
he
lost
so
he
sang
the
merriest
songs
he
knew
the
light
was
fast
fading
when
a
hollow
laugh
startled
frog
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
willow
tree
right
over
his
head
and
he
knew
without
looking
up
that
it
was
solomon
owl
s
deep
voice
frog
tried
to
leap
into
the
brook
but
when
he
uncrossed
his
legs
in
his
haste
he
tangled
them
up
in
his
sewing
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
turn
a
somersault
backward
among
some
bulrushes
hoping
that
solomon
owl
had
not
seen
him
it
is
no
secret
that
frog
was
terribly
afraid
of
solomon
owl
some
of
frog
s
friends
had
mysteriously
disappeared
and
they
had
last
been
seen
in
solomon
s
company
as
it
happened
frog
had
hoped
in
vain
for
solomon
owl
only
laughed
more
loudly
than
before
and
then
he
said
what
are
you
afraid
of
frog
the
tailor
knew
at
once
that
he
was
caught
so
he
hopped
nimbly
to
his
feet
and
answered
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
so
far
as
he
could
see
it
was
a
true
statement
too
because
frog
had
not
yet
discovered
solomon
owl
s
exact
whereabouts
but
he
learned
them
soon
for
solomon
immediately
dropped
down
from
the
big
willow
and
alighted
on
the
bank
near
him
in
fact
for
the
tailor
s
comfort
solomon
looked
at
frog
very
solemnly
and
he
thought
that
he
shivered
what
s
the
matter
are
you
ill
solomon
owl
inquired
you
seem
to
be
just
a
touch
of
chills
and
fever
probably
replied
frog
with
an
uneasy
smile
you
know
it
s
very
damp
you
don
t
look
in
the
best
of
s
a
fact
solomon
owl
remarked
you
appear
to
me
to
be
somewhat
green
in
the
and
he
laughed
once
same
hollow
mirthless
laugh
frog
couldn
t
help
jumping
because
the
sound
alarmed
him
don
t
be
disturbed
said
solomon
owl
i
like
all
the
frog
at
that
remark
frog
started
violently
that
was
exactly
the
trouble
solomon
owl
was
too
of
frogs
whether
they
were
old
or
young
big
or
little
it
was
no
wonder
that
frog
swallowed
rapidly
sixteen
times
before
he
could
say
another
word
iv
an
odd
bargain
while
frog
was
swallowing
nothing
rapidly
he
was
thinking
rapidly
too
there
was
something
about
solomon
owl
s
big
staring
eyes
that
made
frog
feel
uncomfortable
and
if
he
had
thought
he
had
any
chance
of
escaping
he
would
have
dived
into
the
brook
and
swum
under
the
bank
but
solomon
owl
was
too
near
him
for
that
and
frog
was
afraid
his
caller
would
pounce
upon
him
any
moment
so
he
quickly
thought
of
a
plan
to
save
himself
no
he
began
but
solomon
owl
interrupted
him
there
cried
solomon
you
speak
after
all
i
supposed
you
d
swallowed
your
tongue
and
i
was
just
waiting
to
see
what
you
d
do
next
i
thought
maybe
you
would
swallow
your
frog
managed
to
laugh
at
the
joke
though
to
tell
the
truth
he
felt
more
nervous
than
ever
he
saw
what
was
in
solomon
owl
s
mind
for
solomon
was
thinking
of
swallowing
frog
s
head
himself
no
frog
no
doubt
you
ve
come
to
ask
me
to
make
you
a
new
suit
of
now
solomon
owl
had
had
no
such
idea
at
all
but
when
it
was
mentioned
to
him
he
rather
liked
it
will
you
he
inquired
with
a
highly
interested
air
why
certainly
the
tailor
replied
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
turned
his
backward
somersault
into
the
bulrushes
he
smiled
widely
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
he
said
first
i
ll
make
you
a
coat
free
and
second
if
you
like
it
i
will
then
make
you
a
waistcoat
and
trousers
at
double
solomon
owl
liked
the
thought
of
getting
a
coat
for
nothing
but
for
all
that
he
looked
at
the
tailor
somewhat
doubtfully
will
it
take
you
long
he
asked
no
indeed
frog
told
him
i
ll
make
your
coat
while
you
oh
i
wasn
t
going
away
solomon
assured
him
with
an
odd
look
which
made
frog
shiver
again
be
quick
please
because
i
have
some
important
business
to
attend
frog
couldn
t
help
wondering
if
it
wasn
t
he
himself
that
solomon
owl
was
going
to
attend
to
in
spite
of
his
fears
to
work
to
cut
up
some
cloth
that
hung
just
outside
his
door
stop
solomon
owl
cried
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
shake
the
very
ground
you
haven
t
measured
me
yet
it
s
not
necessary
frog
explained
glibly
i
ve
become
so
skilful
that
one
look
at
an
elegant
figure
like
yours
is
all
that
i
naturally
frog
s
remark
pleased
solomon
owl
and
he
uttered
ten
rapid
hoots
which
served
to
make
frog
s
fingers
fly
all
the
faster
soon
he
was
sewing
solomon
s
coat
with
long
stitches
and
though
his
needle
slipped
now
and
then
he
did
not
pause
to
take
out
a
single
stitch
for
some
reason
frog
was
in
a
great
hurry
solomon
owl
did
not
appear
to
notice
that
the
tailor
was
not
taking
much
pains
with
his
sewing
perhaps
frog
worked
so
fast
that
solomon
could
not
see
what
he
was
doing
anyhow
he
was
delighted
when
frog
suddenly
cried
it
s
finished
and
then
he
tossed
the
coat
to
solomon
try
it
on
he
said
i
want
to
see
how
well
it
fits
solomon
owl
held
up
the
garment
and
looked
at
it
very
carefully
and
as
he
examined
it
a
puzzled
look
came
over
his
great
pale
face
there
was
something
about
his
new
coat
that
he
did
not
understand
v
the
cold
weather
coat
yes
as
he
held
up
his
new
coat
and
looked
at
it
solomon
owl
was
puzzled
he
turned
his
head
toward
frog
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
he
turned
his
head
away
from
the
tailor
and
gazed
upon
the
coat
again
frog
was
most
when
solomon
looked
at
everything
s
all
right
isn
t
it
he
inquired
solomon
owl
slowly
shook
his
head
this
is
a
queer
coat
he
said
what
s
this
bag
at
the
top
of
it
oh
exclaimed
frog
that
s
the
hood
knowing
that
you
spend
your
winters
here
in
pleasant
valley
i
made
a
hood
to
go
over
your
head
you
ll
find
it
very
comfortable
in
cold
it
s
the
latest
style
too
all
the
winter
coats
this
year
will
have
hoods
with
holes
to
see
through
you
solomon
owl
looked
relieved
at
frog
s
explanation
but
there
was
still
something
more
that
appeared
to
trouble
him
how
shall
i
get
into
the
coat
he
inquired
it
doesn
t
open
in
front
as
it
another
style
frog
assured
him
it
s
and
instead
of
buttoning
the
coat
you
pull
it
on
over
your
solomon
owl
said
he
didn
t
like
that
style
very
well
then
i
can
easily
change
it
the
tailor
told
him
but
just
try
it
on
he
urged
it
may
please
you
after
so
solomon
owl
pulled
the
coat
over
his
head
and
it
fell
down
about
him
almost
reaching
his
feet
but
the
coat
did
not
seem
to
suit
him
at
all
for
he
began
to
splutter
and
choke
what
s
the
matter
now
frog
asked
him
i
can
t
s
what
s
the
matter
solomon
owl
cried
in
a
voice
that
sounded
hollower
than
ever
because
it
was
muffled
by
the
hood
which
covered
his
head
i
haven
t
cut
the
holes
for
your
eyes
the
tailor
exclaimed
just
wait
a
moment
and
i
ll
make
everything
he
clinked
his
shears
together
sharply
as
he
spoke
but
solomon
owl
told
him
that
he
wouldn
t
of
letting
anybody
use
shears
so
near
his
eyes
solomon
found
frog
s
shop
was
closed
i
ll
take
off
the
coat
he
said
and
i
know
now
that
you
re
a
very
poor
tailor
or
you
wouldn
t
have
made
such
a
he
began
to
tug
at
the
coat
but
he
soon
found
that
taking
it
off
was
not
so
easy
as
putting
it
on
solomon
s
sharp
claws
caught
in
the
cloth
and
his
hooked
beak
too
fastened
itself
in
the
hood
the
moment
he
tried
to
pull
the
coat
over
his
head
here
he
cried
to
frog
just
lend
me
a
hand
i
can
t
see
to
help
but
frog
did
not
even
answer
him
don
t
you
hear
me
solomon
owl
shouted
as
he
struggled
with
his
new
coat
only
to
become
tangled
in
it
more
than
ever
still
the
tailor
said
never
a
word
though
something
very
like
a
giggle
followed
by
a
splash
caught
solomon
s
ear
he
s
left
me
solomon
owl
groaned
mr
frog
has
left
me
to
get
out
of
this
coat
alone
and
goodness
knows
how
i
m
ever
to
do
he
threshed
about
so
vigorously
that
he
tripped
himself
and
fell
upon
the
bank
of
the
brook
rolling
over
and
over
toward
the
water
he
had
a
very
narrow
escape
if
he
hadn
t
happened
to
bring
up
against
an
old
stump
he
would
certainly
have
tumbled
into
the
stream
though
solomon
couldn
t
see
he
knew
that
he
was
in
danger
so
he
lay
on
his
back
on
the
ground
and
carefully
tore
his
new
coat
into
strings
and
ribbons
at
last
he
was
free
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
feeling
very
sheepish
for
he
knew
that
frog
had
played
a
sly
trick
on
him
nevermind
said
solomon
owl
as
he
flew
way
i
ll
come
back
and
ask
frog
to
make
me
a
waistcoat
and
trousers
and
he
did
not
finish
what
he
was
saying
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
whatever
it
was
it
could
not
have
been
very
pleasant
for
frog
just
as
he
had
planned
solomon
owl
returned
to
the
brook
the
next
day
and
he
was
both
surprised
and
disappointed
at
what
he
found
the
door
of
frog
s
tailor
s
shop
was
shut
and
locked
and
on
it
there
was
a
sign
which
said
to
let
he
s
moved
away
cried
solomon
owl
and
he
went
off
feeling
that
he
had
been
cheated
out
of
a
good
say
nothing
of
a
new
new
trousers
too
he
had
not
been
gone
long
when
the
door
opened
and
frog
leaped
nimbly
outside
he
took
the
sign
off
the
door
and
sitting
down
upon
the
bank
he
began
to
sew
upon
jasper
jay
s
new
blue
suit
while
his
face
wore
a
wider
smile
than
ever
he
had
suddenly
decided
not
to
let
his
shop
after
all
vi
solomon
needs
a
change
for
some
time
solomon
owl
had
known
that
a
queer
feeling
was
coming
over
him
and
he
could
not
think
what
it
meant
he
noticed
too
that
his
appetite
was
leaving
him
nothing
seemed
to
taste
good
any
more
so
at
last
one
fine
fall
evening
he
went
to
see
aunt
polly
woodchuck
who
was
an
herb
doctor
for
he
had
begun
to
worry
about
his
health
it
s
lucky
you
came
said
aunt
polly
because
i
m
going
to
begin
my
winter
s
nap
and
you
couldn
t
have
seen
me
again
till
you
happened
to
come
here
on
day
next
february
what
appears
to
be
your
trouble
she
inquired
it
s
my
appetite
partly
solomon
owl
said
nothing
tastes
as
it
did
when
i
was
a
youngster
and
i
keep
longing
for
something
though
what
it
is
i
can
t
just
aunt
polly
woodchuck
nodded
her
head
wisely
what
have
you
been
eating
lately
she
asked
solomon
owl
replied
that
he
hadn
t
eaten
anything
but
mice
since
the
leaves
began
to
turn
leaves
are
nearly
all
off
the
trees
now
the
old
lady
remarked
how
many
mice
have
you
eaten
in
that
time
solomon
said
that
as
nearly
as
he
could
remember
he
had
eaten
a
hundred
and
he
couldn
t
say
one
of
those
numbers
was
correct
aunt
polly
woodchuck
threw
up
her
hands
sakes
alive
she
cried
it
s
no
wonder
you
don
t
feel
well
what
you
need
is
a
change
of
food
and
it
s
lucky
you
came
to
me
now
if
you
d
gone
on
like
that
much
longer
i
d
hate
to
say
what
might
have
happened
to
you
you
d
have
had
dyspepsia
or
some
other
sort
of
misery
in
your
what
shall
i
do
asked
solomon
owl
insects
are
scarce
at
this
season
of
the
year
of
course
there
are
i
don
t
seem
to
care
for
them
and
there
are
they
re
not
easy
to
get
for
they
don
t
come
out
of
the
water
and
sit
on
the
bank
as
the
frogs
how
about
pullets
aunt
polly
inquired
at
that
solomon
owl
let
out
a
long
row
of
hoots
because
he
was
pleased
the
very
thing
he
cried
that
s
what
i
ve
been
wanting
all
this
time
and
i
never
guessed
it
i
ll
pay
you
for
your
advice
the
next
time
i
see
you
he
told
aunt
polly
and
solomon
owl
hurried
away
before
she
could
stop
him
since
he
had
no
intention
of
visiting
her
on
day
he
knew
it
would
be
spring
before
he
saw
aunt
polly
woodchuck
again
the
old
lady
scolded
a
bit
and
it
did
not
make
her
feel
any
pleasanter
to
hear
solomon
s
mocking
laughter
which
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
left
the
pasture
behind
him
then
she
went
inside
her
house
for
she
was
fast
growing
sleepy
and
she
wanted
to
set
things
to
rights
before
she
began
her
long
winter
s
nap
meanwhile
solomon
owl
roamed
restlessly
through
the
woods
there
was
only
one
place
in
the
neighborhood
where
he
could
get
a
pullet
that
was
at
farmer
green
s
chicken
house
and
for
some
reason
he
did
not
care
to
visit
the
farm
buildings
until
it
grew
darker
so
he
amused
himself
by
making
the
woods
echo
with
his
strange
cry
and
now
and
then
he
threw
in
a
few
just
for
extra
measure
many
of
the
forest
folk
who
heard
him
remarked
that
solomon
owl
seemed
to
be
in
extra
fine
spirits
probably
it
s
the
hunter
s
moon
that
pleases
him
jimmy
rabbit
remarked
to
a
friend
of
his
i
ve
always
noticed
that
old
solomon
makes
more
noise
on
moonlight
nights
than
at
any
other
the
hunter
s
moon
big
and
yellow
and
round
was
just
rising
over
blue
mountain
but
for
once
it
was
not
the
moon
that
made
solomon
owl
so
talkative
he
was
in
fine
feather
so
to
speak
because
he
was
hoping
to
have
a
fat
pullet
for
his
supper
and
as
for
the
moon
he
would
have
been
just
as
pleased
had
there
been
none
at
all
that
night
for
solomon
owl
never
cared
to
be
seen
when
he
visited
farmer
green
s
chicken
house
vii
the
blazing
eyes
it
was
some
three
hours
after
sunset
when
solomon
owl
at
last
reached
farmer
green
s
place
all
was
quiet
in
the
chicken
house
because
the
hens
and
roosters
and
their
families
had
long
since
gone
to
roost
and
except
for
a
light
that
shone
through
a
window
the
farmhouse
showed
not
a
sign
of
life
everything
was
as
solomon
owl
wished
so
he
thought
at
least
as
he
alighted
in
a
tree
in
the
yard
to
look
about
him
he
wanted
no
one
to
interrupt
him
when
he
should
go
nosing
around
the
chicken
house
to
find
an
opening
to
his
annoyance
he
had
not
sat
long
in
the
tree
when
the
door
opened
and
solomon
stared
in
amazement
at
the
strange
sight
he
saw
a
great
head
appeared
with
eyes
and
and
nose
a
glaring
flame
color
solomon
had
never
seen
such
a
horrible
face
on
man
or
bird
or
beast
but
he
was
sure
it
was
a
man
for
he
heard
a
laugh
that
was
not
to
be
mistaken
for
either
a
beast
s
or
a
bird
s
and
the
worst
of
it
was
those
blazing
eyes
were
turned
squarely
toward
farmer
green
s
chicken
house
solomon
owl
was
too
wary
to
go
for
his
fat
pullet
just
then
he
decided
that
he
would
wait
quietly
in
the
tree
for
a
time
hoping
that
the
man
would
go
away
while
solomon
watched
him
the
stranger
neither
moved
nor
spoke
and
of
course
solomon
owl
was
growing
hungrier
every
minute
so
at
last
he
felt
that
he
simply
say
something
he
called
out
from
his
tree
but
the
strange
man
did
not
answer
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
he
must
be
some
city
person
solomon
owl
said
to
himself
he
thinks
he
s
too
good
to
speak
to
a
countryman
like
then
solomon
sat
up
and
listened
he
heard
a
scratching
sound
and
soon
he
saw
a
plump
figure
crawl
right
up
into
his
it
was
fatty
coon
what
are
you
doing
here
solomon
owl
asked
in
a
low
voice
which
was
not
any
too
pleasant
i
m
out
for
an
airing
fatty
answered
beautiful
t
it
but
solomon
owl
was
not
interested
in
the
weather
i
don
t
suppose
you
ve
come
down
here
to
get
a
chicken
have
you
he
inquired
fatty
coon
seemed
greatly
surprised
at
the
question
he
exclaimed
but
now
that
you
speak
of
it
it
reminds
me
that
farmer
green
s
saving
a
pullet
for
me
he
was
heard
to
say
not
long
ago
that
he
would
like
to
catch
me
taking
one
of
his
hens
so
he
must
have
one
for
me
and
i
don
t
want
to
disappoint
at
first
solomon
owl
didn
t
know
what
answer
to
make
but
at
last
he
turned
his
head
toward
fatty
why
don
t
you
go
and
get
your
pullet
now
he
asked
there
s
that
man
down
below
with
the
glaring
said
fatty
coon
i
ve
been
waiting
around
here
for
quite
a
long
time
and
he
hasn
t
looked
away
from
the
chicken
house
even
once
do
you
know
him
no
and
i
don
t
want
to
said
solomon
owl
fatty
coon
held
up
a
warning
hand
who
s
that
he
asked
peering
down
at
a
dark
object
at
the
foot
of
their
tree
then
both
he
and
solomon
saw
that
it
was
tommy
fox
sitting
on
his
haunches
and
staring
at
the
big
head
with
its
blazing
eyes
and
nose
and
mouth
not
looking
for
chickens
i
suppose
solomon
owl
called
in
a
low
tone
which
was
hardly
more
than
a
whisper
but
tommy
fox
s
sharp
ears
heard
him
easily
and
he
looked
up
licking
his
chops
as
if
he
were
very
hungry
indeed
and
all
the
while
the
stranger
continued
to
stare
straight
at
the
chicken
house
as
if
he
did
not
intend
to
let
anybody
go
prowling
about
that
long
low
building
to
steal
any
of
farmer
green
s
poultry
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
three
two
in
the
tree
and
one
beneath
it
hesitated
if
the
queer
man
had
only
spoken
they
might
not
have
been
so
timid
but
he
said
never
a
word
viii
watching
the
chickens
solomon
owl
and
fatty
coon
couldn
t
help
laughing
at
what
tommy
fox
said
to
them
as
they
sat
in
their
tree
near
the
farmhouse
looking
down
at
him
in
the
moonlight
i
m
here
to
watch
farmer
green
s
chickens
for
said
to
see
that
no
anybody
away
with
a
farmer
green
has
someone
else
watching
for
him
said
solomon
owl
when
he
had
stopped
laughing
there
s
that
strange
man
you
can
see
how
he
keeps
his
glaring
eyes
fixed
on
the
chicken
house
and
unless
i
m
mistaken
he
s
on
the
lookout
for
no
such
thing
tommy
fox
snapped
and
he
looked
up
at
solomon
as
if
he
wished
that
he
could
climb
the
tree
here
comes
somebody
else
fatty
coon
exclaimed
suddenly
his
keen
eyes
had
caught
sight
of
jimmy
rabbit
hopping
along
on
his
way
to
the
vegetable
garden
to
see
if
he
couldn
t
find
a
stray
cabbage
or
a
turnip
solomon
owl
called
to
him
whereupon
jimmy
rabbit
promptly
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
odd
trio
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
tommy
fox
he
would
have
drawn
nearer
do
you
know
that
stranger
solomon
owl
asked
him
pointing
out
the
horrible
head
to
jimmy
i
haven
t
the
pleasure
said
jimmy
rabbit
after
he
had
taken
a
good
look
well
said
solomon
won
t
you
kindly
speak
to
him
and
ask
him
to
go
away
certainly
answered
jimmy
rabbit
who
always
tried
to
be
obliging
i
hope
the
stranger
won
t
eat
him
remarked
tommy
fox
because
i
hope
to
do
that
some
day
it
was
jimmy
rabbit
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
that
wasn
t
afraid
of
those
glaring
features
he
hopped
straight
up
to
the
big
round
head
which
was
just
a
bit
higher
than
one
of
the
fence
posts
against
which
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
leaning
and
after
a
moment
or
two
jimmy
rabbit
called
to
solomon
and
fatty
and
tommy
fox
he
won
t
go
away
he
s
going
to
stay
right
where
he
is
come
here
a
minute
said
tommy
jimmy
rabbit
shook
his
head
you
come
over
here
he
answered
and
he
did
not
stir
from
the
side
of
the
stranger
he
knew
very
well
that
tommy
fox
was
afraid
of
the
man
with
the
head
with
the
glaring
eyes
as
for
tommy
fox
he
did
not
even
is
to
jimmy
rabbit
but
he
spoke
his
mind
freely
enough
to
his
two
friends
in
the
tree
it
seems
to
me
one
of
you
ought
to
do
something
said
he
we
ll
eat
no
pullets
if
we
can
t
get
rid
of
this
meddlesome
fatty
coon
quite
agreed
with
him
the
one
who
was
here
first
is
the
one
to
act
fatty
declared
that
s
he
told
solomon
owl
so
solomon
owl
felt
most
uncomfortable
i
don
t
know
what
i
can
do
he
said
i
spoke
to
the
him
who
he
was
and
he
wouldn
t
answer
can
t
you
frighten
him
away
tommy
fox
inquired
fly
right
over
his
head
and
give
him
a
blow
with
your
wing
as
you
pass
solomon
owl
coughed
he
was
embarrassed
to
say
the
least
he
s
afraid
fatty
coon
cried
and
both
he
and
tommy
fox
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
he
s
afraid
he
s
afraid
he
s
afraid
it
was
really
more
than
solomon
owl
could
stand
i
m
not
he
retorted
angrily
watch
me
and
you
ll
see
and
without
another
word
he
darted
out
of
the
tree
and
swooped
down
upon
the
stranger
just
brushing
the
top
of
his
head
solomon
owl
knew
at
once
that
he
had
knocked
something
off
the
top
of
that
dreadful
that
fell
to
the
ground
and
made
jimmy
rabbit
jump
nervously
then
solomon
returned
to
his
perch
in
the
tree
he
hasn
t
moved
he
said
but
i
knocked
off
his
you
took
off
the
top
of
his
head
cried
fatty
coon
in
great
excitement
look
the
inside
of
his
head
is
and
peering
down
from
the
solomon
owl
saw
that
fatty
coon
had
told
the
truth
ix
hallowe
en
solomon
owl
was
afraid
of
fire
and
when
he
looked
down
from
his
perch
in
the
tree
and
saw
through
the
hole
in
the
stranger
s
crown
that
all
was
aglow
inside
his
big
round
head
solomon
couldn
t
help
voicing
his
horror
he
so
loudly
that
tommy
fox
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
asked
him
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
his
head
s
all
afire
solomon
owl
told
him
that
s
what
makes
his
eyes
glare
so
and
that
s
why
the
fire
shines
through
his
mouth
and
his
nose
too
it
s
no
wonder
he
didn
t
answer
my
of
course
his
tongue
must
certainly
be
burned
to
a
then
it
ought
to
be
safe
for
anybody
to
enter
the
chicken
house
tommy
fox
observed
what
could
the
stranger
do
when
he
s
in
such
a
fix
he
could
set
the
chicken
house
afire
if
he
followed
you
inside
replied
solomon
owl
wisely
and
i
for
one
am
not
going
near
the
pullets
nor
i
fatty
coon
echoed
i
m
going
straight
to
the
cornfield
the
corn
is
still
standing
there
in
shocks
and
i
ought
to
find
enough
ears
to
make
a
good
but
solomon
owl
and
tommy
fox
were
not
interested
in
corn
they
never
ate
it
and
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
should
be
greatly
disappointed
after
a
person
has
his
mouth
all
made
up
for
chicken
it
is
hard
to
think
of
anything
that
would
taste
even
half
as
good
it
s
queer
he
doesn
t
go
and
hold
his
head
under
the
pump
said
solomon
owl
that
s
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
jimmy
rabbit
had
better
not
go
too
near
him
or
he
ll
get
singed
said
tommy
fox
anxiously
i
don
t
want
anything
to
happen
to
jimmy
rabbit
is
very
careless
solomon
declared
i
don
t
see
what
he
s
thinking
so
near
a
fire
it
makes
me
altogether
too
nervous
to
stay
here
and
i
m
going
away
at
tommy
fox
said
that
he
felt
the
same
way
and
the
moment
fatty
coon
with
his
sharp
claws
started
to
crawl
down
the
tree
on
his
way
to
the
cornfield
tommy
fox
hurried
off
without
even
stopping
to
say
laughed
solomon
owl
tommy
fox
is
afraid
of
you
he
told
fatty
coon
but
fatty
didn
t
seem
to
hear
him
he
was
thinking
only
of
the
supper
of
corn
that
he
was
going
to
have
better
come
away
solomon
owl
called
to
jimmy
rabbit
turning
his
head
toward
the
fence
where
jimmy
had
been
lingering
near
the
stranger
but
jimmy
rabbit
didn
t
answer
him
either
he
was
no
longer
there
the
moment
he
had
seen
tommy
fox
bounding
off
across
the
meadow
jimmy
had
started
at
once
for
farmer
green
s
vegetable
garden
so
solomon
owl
was
the
last
to
leave
there
s
really
nothing
else
i
can
do
he
remarked
to
himself
i
don
t
know
what
aunt
polly
woodchuck
would
say
if
she
knew
that
i
didn
t
follow
her
advice
and
eat
a
pullet
for
my
supper
but
i
ve
tried
my
best
and
that
s
all
anybody
can
solomon
owl
was
upset
all
the
rest
of
that
night
and
just
before
daybreak
he
visited
the
farmyard
again
to
see
whether
the
strange
man
with
the
flaring
head
still
watched
the
chicken
house
and
solomon
found
that
he
had
vanished
so
solomon
owl
alighted
on
the
fence
there
was
nothing
there
except
a
pumpkin
with
a
few
holes
cut
in
it
which
someone
had
left
on
one
of
the
good
said
he
maybe
i
can
get
my
pullet
after
all
he
turned
to
fly
to
the
chicken
house
but
just
then
the
woodshed
door
opened
again
and
farmer
green
stepped
outside
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
he
was
going
to
the
barn
to
milk
the
cows
but
solomon
owl
did
not
wait
to
learn
anything
more
he
hurried
away
to
his
house
among
the
hemlocks
and
having
quickly
settled
himself
for
a
good
nap
he
was
soon
fast
asleep
that
was
how
johnnie
green
s
kept
tommy
fox
and
fatty
coon
and
solomon
owl
from
taking
any
chickens
on
hallowe
en
x
a
troublesome
wishbone
solomon
owl
had
his
waistcoat
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
he
set
off
at
once
for
aunt
polly
woodchuck
s
house
under
the
hill
in
the
pasture
which
he
had
not
visited
since
the
previous
fall
luckily
he
found
the
old
lady
at
home
and
quickly
he
told
her
of
his
trouble
what
have
you
been
eating
she
inquired
i
ve
followed
your
advice
i
ve
been
eating
chickens
said
very
small
chickens
because
they
were
all
i
could
aunt
polly
woodchuck
who
was
an
herb
a
good
him
through
her
spectacles
i
m
afraid
said
she
you
don
t
chew
your
food
properly
bolting
one
s
food
is
very
harmful
it
s
as
bad
as
not
eating
anything
at
all
solomon
owl
showed
plainly
that
her
remark
surprised
him
why
he
exclaimed
i
always
swallow
my
food
it
isn
t
too
big
gracious
me
cried
aunt
polly
throwing
up
both
her
hands
it
s
no
wonder
you
re
it
s
no
wonder
you
have
pains
and
now
i
know
exactly
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
have
a
wishbone
inside
you
i
can
feel
it
she
told
him
as
she
prodded
him
in
the
waistcoat
i
wish
you
could
get
it
out
for
me
said
solomon
with
a
look
of
distress
all
the
wishing
in
the
world
won
t
help
you
she
answered
unless
we
can
find
some
way
of
removing
the
wishbone
so
you
can
wish
on
that
then
i
m
sure
you
would
feel
better
at
this
is
strange
solomon
mused
all
my
life
i
ve
been
swallowing
my
food
without
chewing
it
and
it
has
never
given
me
any
trouble
before
what
shall
i
do
don
t
eat
anything
for
a
week
she
directed
and
fly
against
as
hard
as
you
can
then
come
back
here
after
seven
solomon
owl
went
off
in
a
most
doleful
frame
of
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
so
many
mice
and
frogs
and
chipmunks
as
he
came
across
during
the
following
week
but
he
didn
t
dare
catch
a
single
one
on
account
of
what
aunt
polly
woodchuck
had
said
his
pains
however
grew
less
from
day
to
least
the
pains
that
had
first
troubled
him
but
he
had
others
to
take
their
place
hunger
pangs
these
were
and
they
were
almost
as
bad
as
those
that
had
sent
him
hurrying
to
see
aunt
polly
woodchuck
on
the
whole
solomon
passed
a
very
unhappy
week
flying
head
foremost
into
as
aunt
polly
had
instructed
him
to
do
gave
him
many
bumps
and
bruises
so
he
was
glad
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
return
to
her
house
in
the
pasture
solomon
s
neighbors
had
been
so
interested
in
watching
him
that
they
were
all
sorry
when
he
ceased
his
strange
actions
indeed
there
was
a
rumor
that
solomon
had
become
very
angry
with
farmer
green
and
that
he
was
trying
to
knock
down
some
of
farmer
green
s
trees
before
the
end
of
that
unpleasant
week
solomon
had
often
noticed
as
many
as
of
the
forest
folk
following
him
about
hoping
to
see
a
tree
fall
but
they
were
all
disappointed
however
they
enjoyed
the
sight
of
solomon
hurling
himself
against
and
the
louder
he
groaned
the
more
people
gathered
around
him
xi
cured
at
last
how
do
you
feel
now
aunt
polly
woodchuck
asked
solomon
owl
when
he
had
come
back
to
her
house
after
a
week
s
absence
no
better
he
groaned
i
still
have
pains
but
they
seem
to
have
moved
and
scattered
all
over
good
she
exclaimed
with
a
smile
you
much
better
though
you
didn
t
know
it
the
wishbone
is
broken
you
broke
it
by
flying
against
the
trees
and
you
ought
not
to
have
any
more
trouble
but
let
me
examine
you
she
said
prodding
him
in
the
waistcoat
once
more
this
is
odd
she
continued
a
bit
later
i
can
feel
the
wishbone
more
plainly
than
that
s
my
own
wishbone
solomon
cried
indignantly
i
ve
grown
so
thin
through
not
eating
that
it
s
a
wonder
you
can
t
feel
my
backbone
aunt
polly
woodchuck
looked
surprised
perhaps
you
re
right
said
she
not
having
a
wishbone
of
my
own
i
forgot
that
you
had
a
look
of
disgust
came
over
solomon
owl
s
face
you
re
a
very
poor
doctor
he
told
her
here
you
ve
kept
me
from
eating
for
a
whole
i
don
t
believe
it
was
necessary
at
all
well
you
re
better
aren
t
you
she
asked
him
i
shall
be
as
soon
as
i
have
a
good
meal
replied
solomon
owl
hopefully
you
ought
not
to
eat
anything
for
another
week
aunt
polly
told
him
solemnly
nonsense
he
cried
i
m
a
doctor
and
i
ought
to
know
best
she
insisted
but
solomon
owl
hooted
rudely
i
ll
never
come
to
you
for
advice
any
more
he
declared
i
firmly
believe
that
my
whole
trouble
was
simply
that
i
ve
been
eating
too
sparingly
and
i
shall
take
good
care
to
see
that
it
doesn
t
happen
no
one
had
ever
spoken
to
aunt
polly
in
quite
that
old
crow
had
complained
one
time
that
she
had
cured
him
but
she
did
not
lose
her
temper
in
spite
of
solomon
s
jeers
you
ll
be
back
here
again
the
very
next
time
you
re
ill
she
remarked
and
if
you
continue
to
swallow
your
food
but
solomon
owl
did
not
even
wait
to
hear
what
she
said
he
was
so
impolite
that
he
flew
away
while
she
was
talking
and
since
it
was
then
almost
dark
and
a
good
time
to
look
for
field
mice
he
began
his
night
s
hunting
right
there
in
farmer
green
s
pasture
by
morning
solomon
was
so
plump
that
aunt
polly
woodchuck
would
have
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
finding
his
wishbone
but
since
he
did
not
visit
her
again
she
had
no
further
chance
to
prod
him
in
the
waistcoat
afterward
solomon
heard
a
bit
of
gossip
that
annoyed
him
a
friend
of
his
reported
that
aunt
polly
woodchuck
was
going
about
and
telling
everybody
how
she
had
saved
solomon
s
life
mice
he
exclaimed
he
often
said
that
when
some
would
have
said
rats
there
s
not
a
word
of
truth
in
her
claim
and
if
people
in
this
neighborhood
keep
on
taking
her
advice
and
her
catnip
tea
they
re
going
to
be
sorry
some
day
for
they
ll
be
really
ill
the
first
thing
they
know
and
then
what
will
they
do
xii
benjamin
bat
solomon
owl
was
by
no
means
the
only
in
pleasant
valley
he
had
neighbors
that
chose
to
sleep
in
the
daytime
so
they
might
roam
through
the
woods
and
fields
after
dark
one
of
these
was
benjamin
bat
and
furthermore
he
was
the
color
of
night
itself
now
benjamin
bat
was
an
odd
chap
when
he
was
still
he
liked
to
hang
by
his
feet
upside
down
and
when
he
was
flying
he
sailed
about
in
a
zigzag
fashion
he
went
in
so
many
different
directions
turning
this
way
and
that
one
could
never
tell
where
he
was
going
one
might
say
that
his
life
was
just
one
continual
he
wasn
t
resting
with
his
heels
where
his
head
ought
to
be
a
good
many
of
benjamin
bat
s
friends
said
he
certainly
must
be
crazy
because
he
didn
t
do
as
they
did
but
that
never
made
the
slightest
difference
in
benjamin
bat
s
habits
he
continued
to
zigzag
through
hang
by
his
the
same
perhaps
he
thought
that
all
other
people
were
crazy
because
they
didn
t
do
likewise
benjamin
often
dodged
across
solomon
owl
s
path
when
solomon
was
hunting
for
field
mice
and
since
benjamin
was
the
least
bit
like
a
mouse
for
his
was
a
time
once
when
solomon
tried
to
catch
him
but
solomon
owl
soon
found
that
chasing
benjamin
bat
made
him
dizzy
if
benjamin
hadn
t
been
used
to
hanging
head
downward
maybe
he
would
have
been
dizzy
too
though
the
two
often
saw
each
other
benjamin
bat
never
seemed
to
care
to
stop
for
a
chat
with
solomon
owl
one
night
however
benjamin
actually
called
to
solomon
and
asked
his
advice
he
was
in
trouble
and
he
knew
that
solomon
owl
was
supposed
by
some
to
be
the
wisest
old
fellow
for
miles
around
it
was
almost
morning
and
solomon
owl
was
hurrying
home
because
a
terrible
storm
had
arisen
the
lightning
was
flashing
and
peals
of
thunder
crashed
through
the
woods
big
drops
of
rain
were
already
pattering
down
but
solomon
owl
did
not
care
for
he
had
almost
reached
his
house
in
the
hollow
hemlock
near
the
foot
of
blue
mountain
it
was
different
with
benjamin
bat
that
night
he
had
strayed
a
long
distance
from
his
home
in
cedar
swamp
and
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
i
want
to
get
under
cover
somewhere
he
told
solomon
owl
you
don
t
know
of
a
good
place
do
you
where
i
can
get
out
of
the
storm
and
take
a
nap
why
yes
answered
solomon
owl
come
right
along
to
my
house
and
spend
the
day
with
me
but
benjamin
bat
did
not
like
the
suggestion
at
all
i
m
afraid
i
might
crowd
you
he
said
he
was
thinking
of
the
time
when
solomon
owl
had
chased
him
and
sleeping
in
solomon
owl
s
house
seemed
far
from
a
safe
thing
to
do
benjamin
asked
solomon
s
advice
solomon
was
wise
enough
to
guess
what
was
going
on
inside
benjamin
s
head
come
along
he
said
we
ll
both
be
asleep
before
we
know
it
i
m
sorry
i
can
t
offer
you
something
to
eat
but
i
haven
t
a
morsel
of
food
in
my
house
no
doubt
though
you
ve
just
had
a
good
meal
ate
seven
mice
and
i
certainly
couldn
t
eat
anything
when
solomon
owl
told
him
that
benjamin
bat
thought
perhaps
there
was
no
danger
after
all
and
since
the
rain
was
falling
harder
and
harder
every
moment
he
thanked
solomon
and
said
he
would
be
glad
to
accent
his
invitation
follow
me
then
said
solomon
owl
and
he
led
the
way
to
his
home
in
the
hemlock
for
once
benjamin
bat
flew
in
a
fairly
straight
line
though
he
did
a
little
dodging
because
he
couldn
t
help
it
there
was
more
room
inside
solomon
s
house
than
benjamin
bat
had
supposed
while
benjamin
was
looking
about
and
telling
solomon
that
he
had
a
fine
home
his
host
quickly
made
a
bed
of
leaves
in
one
corner
of
the
was
only
one
room
of
course
that
s
for
you
said
solomon
owl
i
always
sleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
and
without
waiting
even
to
make
sure
that
his
guest
was
comfortable
solomon
owl
lay
down
and
began
to
he
was
very
sleepy
it
was
so
cozy
there
that
benjamin
bat
was
glad
already
that
he
had
accepted
solomon
s
invitation
xiii
the
lucky
guest
in
the
middle
of
the
day
solomon
owl
happened
to
awake
he
was
sorry
that
he
hadn
t
slept
until
sunset
because
he
was
very
hungry
knowing
that
it
was
light
outside
his
hollow
tree
he
didn
t
want
to
leave
home
to
find
something
to
eat
then
suddenly
he
remembered
that
he
had
brought
benjamin
bat
to
his
house
early
that
morning
so
benjamin
might
escape
the
storm
why
not
eat
benjamin
bat
as
soon
as
the
thought
occurred
to
him
solomon
owl
liked
it
and
he
moved
stealthily
over
to
the
bed
of
leaves
he
had
made
for
his
guest
just
before
daybreak
but
benjamin
bat
was
not
there
though
solomon
looked
in
every
nook
and
cranny
of
his
house
he
did
not
find
him
he
must
have
left
as
soon
as
it
stopped
raining
said
solomon
owl
to
himself
he
might
at
least
have
waited
to
thank
me
for
giving
him
a
day
s
lodging
it
s
the
last
time
i
ll
ever
bring
any
worthless
vagabond
into
my
house
and
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
crazy
person
like
benjamin
anybody
can
see
that
solomon
owl
was
displeased
but
it
was
not
at
all
astonishing
if
one
stops
to
remember
how
hungry
he
was
and
that
he
had
expected
to
enjoy
a
good
meal
without
the
trouble
of
going
away
from
home
to
get
it
solomon
owl
went
to
the
door
of
his
house
and
looked
out
the
sun
was
shining
so
brightly
that
after
blinking
in
his
doorway
for
a
few
minutes
he
decided
that
he
would
go
to
bed
again
and
try
to
sleep
until
dusk
he
never
liked
bright
days
they
re
so
dismal
he
used
to
say
give
me
a
good
dark
night
and
i
m
happy
for
there
s
nothing
more
cheering
than
in
spite
of
the
pangs
of
hunger
that
gnawed
inside
him
solomon
at
last
succeeded
in
falling
asleep
once
more
and
he
dreamed
that
he
chased
benjamin
bat
three
times
around
blue
mountain
and
then
three
times
back
again
in
the
opposite
direction
but
he
never
could
catch
him
because
benjamin
bat
simply
wouldn
t
fly
straight
his
zigzag
course
was
so
confusing
that
even
in
his
dream
solomon
owl
grew
dizzy
now
benjamin
bat
was
in
solomon
s
house
all
the
time
and
the
reason
why
solomon
owl
hadn
t
found
him
was
a
very
simple
one
it
was
merely
that
solomon
hadn
t
looked
in
the
right
place
benjamin
bat
was
you
might
his
hungry
host
never
once
thought
of
looking
for
him
and
being
asleep
all
the
while
benjamin
didn
t
once
move
or
make
the
slightest
noise
if
he
had
snored
or
sneezed
or
rustled
his
wings
no
doubt
solomon
owl
would
have
found
him
when
benjamin
awakened
late
in
the
afternoon
solomon
was
still
sleeping
and
benjamin
crept
through
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
gathering
twilight
without
arousing
solomon
i
ll
thank
him
the
next
time
i
meet
him
benjamin
bat
decided
and
he
staggered
away
through
the
air
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
himself
where
he
was
going
but
of
course
that
was
only
his
queer
way
of
flying
when
he
told
his
friends
where
he
had
spent
the
day
they
were
astonished
how
did
you
ever
dare
do
anything
so
dangerous
as
sleeping
in
solomon
owl
s
house
they
all
asked
him
but
benjamin
bat
only
said
oh
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
and
he
began
to
feel
quite
important
xiv
hanging
by
the
heels
it
was
several
nights
before
solomon
owl
and
benjamin
bat
chanced
to
meet
again
in
the
forest
hullo
said
solomon
hullo
said
benjamin
bat
i
m
glad
to
see
you
because
i
want
to
thank
you
for
letting
me
spend
the
day
in
your
house
so
i
wouldn
t
have
to
stay
out
in
the
you
must
be
a
light
sleeper
solomon
observed
he
did
not
tell
benjamin
that
he
was
welcome
what
makes
you
think
that
benjamin
bat
inquired
left
my
house
before
noon
solomon
told
him
oh
no
said
benjamin
i
slept
soundly
until
sunset
when
i
came
away
the
crickets
were
chirping
and
i
was
surprised
that
you
hadn
t
waked
up
you
were
gone
before
midday
solomon
owl
insisted
and
they
had
something
very
like
a
dispute
while
solomon
owl
sat
in
one
tree
and
benjamin
bat
hung
head
downward
from
another
i
ought
to
know
said
solomon
i
was
awake
about
noon
and
i
looked
everywhere
for
what
for
asked
benjamin
naturally
solomon
didn
t
like
to
tell
him
that
he
had
intended
to
eat
him
so
he
looked
said
nothing
you
didn
t
look
on
the
ceiling
did
you
benjamin
bat
inquired
no
indeed
solomon
owl
exclaimed
well
that
s
where
i
was
hanging
by
my
feet
benjamin
bat
informed
him
solomon
owl
certainly
was
surprised
to
hear
that
the
idea
he
cried
you
re
a
queer
one
i
never
once
thought
of
looking
the
for
a
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
spoke
before
he
thought
how
oddly
his
remark
would
sound
to
another
when
he
heard
what
solomon
owl
said
benjamin
bat
knew
at
once
that
solomon
had
meant
to
eat
him
and
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
dropped
from
the
limb
to
which
he
was
clinging
and
flew
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
for
once
in
his
life
he
flew
in
a
straight
line
with
no
zigzags
at
all
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
solomon
owl
all
he
still
be
very
hungry
but
solomon
owl
had
caught
so
many
mice
that
night
that
he
didn
t
feel
like
chasing
anybody
so
he
sat
motionless
in
the
tree
merely
turning
his
head
to
watch
benjamin
sailing
away
through
the
dusky
woods
he
noticed
that
benjamin
didn
t
dodge
at
when
there
was
a
tree
in
his
way
and
he
wondered
what
the
reason
was
perhaps
he
s
not
so
crazy
as
i
supposed
said
solomon
owl
to
himself
and
ever
afterward
when
he
happened
to
awake
and
feel
hungry
solomon
owl
used
to
look
up
at
the
ceiling
above
him
and
wish
that
benjamin
bat
was
there
but
benjamin
bat
never
cared
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
solomon
owl
he
said
he
had
a
good
reason
for
avoiding
him
and
ever
afterward
he
passed
for
a
very
brave
person
among
his
friends
they
often
pointed
him
out
to
strangers
saying
there
s
benjamin
bat
doesn
t
know
what
fear
is
why
once
he
even
spent
a
whole
day
asleep
in
solomon
owl
s
house
and
if
you
don
t
think
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
then
i
guess
you
don
t
know
solomon
xv
disputes
settled
solomon
owl
looked
so
wise
that
many
of
his
neighbors
fell
into
the
habit
of
going
to
him
for
advice
if
two
of
the
forest
folk
chanced
to
have
a
dispute
which
they
could
not
settle
between
them
they
frequently
visited
solomon
and
asked
him
to
decide
which
was
in
the
right
and
in
the
course
of
time
solomon
became
known
far
and
wide
for
his
ability
to
patch
up
a
quarrel
at
last
jimmy
rabbit
stopped
solomon
owl
one
night
and
suggested
that
he
hang
a
sign
outside
his
house
so
that
there
shouldn
t
be
anybody
in
the
whole
valley
that
wouldn
t
know
what
to
do
in
case
he
found
himself
in
an
argument
solomon
decided
on
the
spot
that
jimmy
rabbit
s
idea
was
a
good
one
so
he
hurried
home
and
before
morning
he
had
his
sign
made
and
put
out
where
everyone
could
see
it
it
looked
like
this
disputes
settled
within
there
was
only
one
objection
to
the
sign
as
soon
as
jimmy
rabbit
saw
it
he
told
solomon
that
it
should
have
said
disputes
settled
without
without
what
solomon
owl
inquired
why
without
going
into
your
house
said
jimmy
rabbit
i
can
t
climb
a
tree
you
know
and
neither
can
tommy
fox
we
might
have
a
dispute
and
how
could
you
ever
settle
it
oh
i
shall
be
willing
to
step
outside
solomon
told
him
and
he
refused
to
change
the
sign
declaring
that
he
liked
it
just
as
it
was
now
there
was
only
one
trouble
with
solomon
owl
s
settling
of
disputes
many
of
the
forest
folk
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
daytime
and
was
the
only
time
was
willing
to
see
them
but
he
heard
so
many
objections
to
that
arrangement
that
in
the
end
solomon
agreed
to
meet
people
at
dusk
and
at
dawn
when
it
was
neither
very
dark
nor
very
light
on
the
whole
he
found
that
way
very
satisfactory
because
there
was
just
enough
light
at
dusk
and
at
dawn
to
make
him
blink
and
when
solomon
blinked
he
looked
even
wiser
than
ever
well
the
first
disputing
pair
that
came
to
solomon
s
tree
after
he
hung
out
his
new
sign
were
old
crow
and
jasper
jay
they
reached
the
hemlock
grove
soon
after
sunset
and
squalled
loudly
for
solomon
hurry
crow
cried
as
soon
as
solomon
owl
stepped
outside
his
door
it
will
be
dark
before
we
know
it
and
it
s
almost
our
what
s
your
difficulty
solomon
asked
them
crow
looked
at
jasper
jay
and
then
he
looked
at
solomon
again
maybe
you
won
t
like
to
hear
it
he
said
and
he
winked
at
jasper
but
you
ve
put
out
this
we
ve
come
you
ve
done
just
right
exclaimed
solomon
owl
and
as
for
my
not
liking
to
hear
the
trouble
it
s
your
dispute
and
not
mine
so
i
don
t
see
how
it
concerns
to
settle
very
well
crow
answered
the
dispute
then
is
this
jasper
says
that
in
spite
of
your
looking
so
wise
you
re
really
the
stupidest
person
in
pleasant
he
does
eh
cried
solomon
owl
while
jasper
jay
laughed
loudly
and
you
of
course
do
not
agree
with
him
solomon
continued
i
do
not
crow
declared
good
said
solomon
nodding
his
head
approvingly
no
i
do
not
agree
with
jasper
jay
crow
said
i
claim
that
there
s
one
other
person
more
stupid
than
you
that
s
fatty
well
solomon
owl
certainly
was
displeased
and
it
didn
t
make
him
feel
any
happier
to
hear
jasper
jay
s
boisterous
shouts
or
the
hoarse
of
old
crow
i
hope
you
can
decide
which
one
of
us
is
right
crow
ventured
i
am
of
course
cried
jasper
jay
you
re
not
crow
shouted
and
to
solomon
owl
he
said
we
ve
been
disputing
like
this
all
day
solomon
owl
didn
t
know
what
to
say
if
he
announced
that
jasper
was
right
it
would
be
the
same
as
admitting
that
he
was
the
stupidest
person
in
the
whole
neighborhood
and
if
he
said
that
old
crow
s
opinion
was
correct
he
would
not
be
much
better
off
naturally
he
didn
t
want
to
tell
either
of
them
that
he
was
right
i
ll
have
to
think
about
this
solomon
observed
at
last
we
don
t
want
to
wait
said
crow
if
we
keep
on
disputing
we
re
likely
to
have
a
now
solomon
owl
hoped
that
they
would
have
a
fight
so
he
was
determined
to
keep
them
waiting
for
his
decision
come
back
at
this
time
he
said
xvi
nine
fights
the
next
evening
just
at
dusk
jasper
jay
and
old
crow
returned
to
solomon
owl
s
house
looking
much
bedraggled
one
of
crow
s
eyes
was
almost
closed
and
jasper
jay
s
crest
seemed
to
have
been
torn
half
off
his
head
what
s
the
matter
asked
solomon
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
we
ve
had
three
fights
said
jasper
jay
yes
and
i
ve
whipped
him
each
time
cried
crow
so
i
must
be
in
the
right
and
you
d
better
decide
our
dispute
in
my
favor
at
but
solomon
owl
was
still
in
no
hurry
it
s
a
difficult
question
to
settle
said
he
i
don
t
want
to
make
any
mistake
so
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
come
back
here
at
this
both
jasper
and
crow
seemed
disappointed
although
crow
had
won
each
fight
he
was
very
weary
for
he
was
older
than
jasper
jay
as
they
went
off
solomon
owl
began
to
feel
much
pleased
with
himself
the
following
evening
at
sunset
old
crow
and
jasper
jay
visited
solomon
owl
once
more
and
they
looked
more
battered
than
ever
we
ve
had
three
more
fights
said
crow
yes
and
i
won
each
time
jasper
jay
piped
up
so
i
must
be
in
the
right
and
you
d
better
decide
in
my
favor
without
any
further
solomon
owl
thought
deeply
for
some
time
maybe
i
ought
to
wait
until
he
began
but
his
callers
both
shouted
no
well
said
solomon
mr
crow
has
won
three
fights
and
jasper
jay
has
won
three
so
it
is
certain
that
each
must
be
in
the
but
that
announcement
did
not
satisfy
jasper
and
crow
and
they
left
the
hemlock
grove
disputing
more
loudly
than
ever
and
the
next
day
at
dusk
they
came
back
again
we
ve
had
three
more
fights
and
i
won
they
both
cried
at
the
same
time
that
proves
my
claim
said
solomon
owl
you
re
both
they
whispered
together
for
a
few
minutes
we
don
t
like
your
way
of
settling
disputes
crow
remarked
shortly
but
we
ve
decided
to
stop
good
said
solomon
owl
that
shows
that
you
are
yes
replied
jasper
we
ve
decided
to
stop
quarreling
and
fight
wait
a
moment
said
solomon
owl
hastily
as
they
drew
nearer
i
don
t
want
my
new
suit
and
he
ducked
inside
the
hollow
tree
before
they
could
reach
him
jasper
and
crow
waited
and
waited
but
solomon
owl
did
not
reappear
and
since
his
two
visitors
did
not
dare
follow
him
into
the
dark
cavern
where
he
lived
they
decided
at
last
that
they
would
go
get
into
bed
let
s
take
away
his
sign
anyhow
jasper
jay
suggested
so
they
pulled
down
solomon
s
sign
which
said
disputes
settled
within
and
they
carried
it
off
with
them
and
hid
it
in
some
bushes
that
same
night
solomon
owl
hunted
for
it
for
a
long
time
but
he
never
found
it
he
decided
not
to
hang
out
another
for
he
saw
that
settling
disputes
was
a
dangerous
business
xvii
cousin
simon
screecher
solomon
owl
had
a
small
cousin
named
simon
screecher
he
was
unlike
solomon
in
some
respects
because
he
always
wore
and
his
eyes
were
yellow
instead
of
black
but
in
some
other
ways
he
was
no
different
from
solomon
owl
for
he
was
a
noisy
chap
and
dearly
loved
eat
it
happened
that
the
two
met
in
the
woods
one
fine
fall
evening
and
they
agreed
to
go
hunting
mice
together
now
being
so
much
smaller
than
solomon
simon
screecher
was
all
the
spryer
in
fact
he
was
so
active
that
he
could
catch
mice
faster
than
solomon
owl
could
capture
them
and
they
had
not
hunted
long
before
solomon
discovered
that
simon
had
succeeded
in
disposing
of
six
mice
to
his
three
that
discovery
did
not
please
solomon
at
all
look
here
he
said
since
we
are
hunting
together
it
s
only
fair
to
divide
what
we
catch
half
and
simon
screecher
hesitated
but
after
reflecting
that
his
cousin
was
very
big
and
very
strong
he
agreed
to
solomon
s
suggestion
so
they
resumed
their
hunting
and
every
time
one
of
them
caught
two
mice
he
gave
one
mouse
to
his
cousin
still
solomon
owl
was
not
satisfied
wait
a
moment
solomon
called
to
simon
screecher
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
i
am
more
than
twice
as
big
as
you
are
so
i
ought
to
have
twice
as
many
mice
as
this
time
simon
screecher
hesitated
longer
he
did
not
like
the
second
suggestion
even
as
well
as
the
first
and
in
the
end
he
said
as
much
too
but
solomon
owl
insisted
that
it
was
only
fair
you
surely
ought
to
be
glad
to
please
your
own
cousin
he
told
simon
it
s
not
that
said
simon
screecher
it
seems
to
me
that
since
i
m
not
half
your
size
i
ought
to
have
twice
as
many
mice
to
eat
so
i
ll
grow
well
solomon
owl
hadn
t
thought
of
that
he
was
puzzled
to
know
what
to
say
and
he
wanted
time
in
which
to
ponder
i
ll
think
over
what
you
say
he
told
simon
screecher
and
now
since
it
s
almost
dawn
we
d
better
not
hunt
any
longer
but
i
ll
meet
you
again
at
dusk
if
you
ll
come
to
my
very
well
cousin
solomon
simon
answered
i
m
sure
that
after
you
ve
had
a
good
sleep
you
ll
be
ready
to
agree
with
if
that
s
the
case
i
may
not
take
any
nap
at
all
solomon
replied
oh
you
ought
to
have
your
rest
his
cousin
exclaimed
simon
knew
that
if
solomon
went
all
day
without
sleep
he
would
be
frightfully
peevish
by
nightfall
ll
try
to
get
forty
winks
solomon
promised
but
i
don
t
believe
i
can
get
more
than
that
because
i
have
so
much
on
my
mind
that
i
m
sure
to
be
simon
screecher
was
somewhat
worried
as
they
parted
his
wailing
tremulous
whistle
which
floated
through
the
shadowy
woods
showed
that
he
was
far
from
happy
xviii
xviii
a
cousinly
quarrel
it
proved
to
be
just
as
solomon
owl
had
told
his
cousin
simon
screecher
solomon
had
so
much
on
his
mind
that
he
had
no
sooner
fallen
asleep
than
he
awoke
again
to
study
over
the
question
that
perplexed
him
he
certainly
did
not
want
simon
to
have
twice
as
many
mice
as
he
but
simon
s
argument
was
a
good
one
he
had
said
that
since
solomon
was
more
than
twice
his
size
it
was
proper
that
he
should
have
a
chance
to
grow
and
everybody
knew
that
made
one
larger
the
longer
solomon
pondered
the
farther
he
seemed
from
any
answer
that
he
liked
and
he
had
begun
to
fear
that
he
would
not
succeed
in
getting
more
than
winks
all
of
all
at
once
an
idea
came
into
his
mind
solomon
knew
right
away
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
worry
about
he
dropped
into
a
sound
sleep
with
a
pleasant
smile
upon
his
usually
solemn
face
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
it
was
time
for
simon
screecher
to
arrive
yes
solomon
could
hear
his
cousin
s
whistle
even
then
so
he
hurried
to
his
door
and
there
was
simon
sitting
on
a
limb
of
the
big
hemlock
waiting
for
him
it
s
all
right
said
solomon
to
his
cousin
i
agree
to
your
suggestion
we
ll
hunt
together
again
and
if
you
will
give
me
of
all
the
mice
you
catch
i
promise
to
give
you
of
all
the
mice
that
i
good
said
simon
screecher
and
he
looked
vastly
relieved
just
hoot
when
you
have
any
mice
for
me
whistle
when
you
have
any
for
me
solomon
owl
replied
and
at
that
they
started
out
for
their
night
s
sport
it
was
not
long
before
simon
screecher
s
well
known
whistle
brought
solomon
hurrying
to
him
simon
already
had
three
mice
one
of
which
he
gave
to
solomon
according
to
their
agreement
that
same
thing
happened
several
times
until
at
last
simon
screecher
began
to
grumble
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
his
cousin
you
are
not
hooting
as
you
promised
you
but
i
haven
t
caught
any
mice
yet
solomon
owl
replied
it
s
all
right
said
solomon
again
and
again
and
again
simon
s
call
summoned
solomon
but
not
once
did
solomon
s
summon
simon
and
all
the
time
simon
screecher
grew
more
discontented
toward
the
end
of
the
night
he
declared
flatly
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
hunt
any
more
with
his
cousin
i
ve
done
exactly
as
i
agreed
solomon
owl
protested
you
re
altogether
too
slow
and
clumsy
simon
screecher
told
him
bluntly
if
i
m
going
to
hunt
with
anybody
after
this
i
m
going
to
choose
someone
that
s
as
spry
as
i
am
there
s
no
sense
in
my
working
for
you
here
i
ve
toiled
all
night
long
and
i
m
still
hungry
for
i
ve
given
you
a
third
of
my
they
parted
none
too
pleasantly
in
simon
s
whistle
as
he
flew
away
toward
his
home
there
was
unmistakable
anger
but
solomon
owl
s
answering
they
were
not
exactly
to
carry
more
than
a
hint
of
laughter
one
would
naturally
think
that
solomon
might
have
been
even
hungrier
than
his
small
cousin
but
it
was
not
so
he
had
had
more
to
eat
than
usual
for
he
had
been
very
busy
catching
locusts
and
frogs
too
solomon
owl
had
not
tried
to
catch
a
single
mouse
that
night
you
know
now
the
idea
that
had
come
to
him
while
he
was
lying
awake
in
his
house
during
the
daytime
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
hunt
for
and
since
he
had
not
promised
simon
to
give
him
anything
else
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
eat
all
the
frogs
and
katydids
and
locusts
that
he
could
find
perhaps
it
was
not
surprising
that
simon
screecher
never
guessed
the
truth
but
he
seemed
to
know
that
there
was
something
queer
about
that
night
s
hunting
for
he
never
came
to
solomon
owl
s
house
again
xix
the
sleet
storm
it
was
winter
and
for
several
days
a
strong
south
wind
had
swept
up
pleasant
valley
solomon
owl
knew
very
meant
a
thaw
was
coming
he
was
not
sorry
because
the
weather
had
been
bitterly
cold
well
the
thaw
came
and
the
weather
grew
so
warm
that
solomon
owl
could
stay
out
all
night
without
once
feeling
chilled
he
found
the
change
so
agreeable
that
he
strayed
further
from
home
than
was
his
custom
indeed
he
was
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
blue
mountain
at
midnight
when
it
began
to
rain
now
that
was
not
quite
so
pleasant
but
still
solomon
did
not
mind
greatly
it
was
not
until
later
that
he
began
to
feel
alarmed
when
he
noticed
that
flying
did
not
seem
so
easy
as
usual
solomon
had
grown
heavy
all
at
goodness
knows
it
was
not
because
he
had
overeaten
for
food
was
scarce
at
that
season
of
the
year
moreover
solomon
s
wings
were
strangely
stiff
when
he
moved
them
they
it
must
be
my
joints
he
said
to
himself
i
m
afraid
this
wetting
has
given
me
so
he
started
home
at
it
was
only
midnight
but
the
further
he
went
the
worse
he
the
harder
it
was
to
fly
i
ll
have
to
rest
a
while
he
said
to
himself
at
last
so
he
alighted
on
a
limb
for
he
was
more
tired
than
he
had
ever
been
in
all
his
life
but
he
soon
felt
so
much
better
that
he
was
ready
to
start
on
again
and
then
to
his
dismay
solomon
owl
found
that
he
could
hardly
stir
the
moment
he
left
his
perch
he
floundered
down
upon
the
ground
and
though
he
tried
his
hardest
he
couldn
t
reach
the
tree
again
the
rain
was
still
beating
down
steadily
and
solomon
began
to
think
it
a
bad
night
to
be
out
what
was
worse
the
weather
was
fast
turning
cold
i
m
afraid
i
ll
have
to
stay
in
bed
a
week
after
this
he
groaned
if
i
sit
here
long
as
wet
as
i
am
while
the
thaw
turns
into
a
i
shall
certainly
be
now
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
rain
solomon
owl
would
have
had
no
trouble
at
all
or
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
freezing
cold
he
would
have
been
in
no
difficulty
though
he
didn
t
know
it
his
trouble
was
simply
this
the
rain
froze
upon
him
as
fast
as
it
fell
covering
him
with
a
coating
of
ice
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
felt
strangely
wonder
that
he
couldn
t
fly
there
he
crouched
on
the
ground
while
the
rain
and
sleet
beat
upon
him
and
the
only
comforting
thought
that
entered
his
head
was
that
on
so
stormy
a
night
tommy
fox
and
fatty
coon
would
be
snug
and
warm
in
their
beds
wouldn
t
go
out
in
such
weather
and
solomon
owl
wished
that
he
too
had
stayed
at
home
that
night
from
midnight
until
almost
dawn
solomon
owl
sat
there
now
and
then
he
tried
to
fly
but
it
was
no
use
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
off
the
ground
at
last
he
decided
he
would
have
to
home
fortunately
a
hard
crust
covered
the
soft
snow
so
solomon
started
off
on
his
long
journey
flying
solomon
could
have
covered
the
distance
in
a
few
minutes
but
he
was
a
slow
walker
by
the
time
he
reached
his
home
among
the
hemlocks
the
sun
was
shining
the
rain
had
stopped
before
daybreak
solomon
wondered
how
he
would
ever
succeed
in
reaching
his
doorway
high
up
in
the
hollow
tree
he
gazed
helplessly
upward
and
as
he
sat
there
mournfully
the
bright
sunshine
melted
the
ice
that
bound
his
wings
after
a
time
he
discovered
that
he
could
move
freely
once
more
and
then
he
rose
quickly
in
the
air
and
in
a
twinkling
he
had
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
his
darkness
which
to
him
was
always
so
pleasant
xx
a
pair
of
in
the
woods
there
was
hardly
one
of
solomon
owl
s
neighbors
that
couldn
t
point
out
the
big
hemlock
tree
where
he
lived
and
mischievous
fellows
like
reddy
woodpecker
sometimes
annoyed
solomon
a
good
deal
by
rapping
loudly
on
his
door
when
he
thrust
his
head
angrily
out
of
his
house
and
blinked
in
the
sunlight
his
tormentors
would
skip
away
and
laugh
they
laughed
because
they
knew
that
they
had
awakened
solomon
owl
and
they
dodged
out
of
his
reach
because
he
was
always
when
anybody
disturbed
his
rest
in
the
daytime
solomon
owl
did
not
mind
so
much
so
long
as
that
trick
was
not
played
on
him
too
often
but
after
a
time
it
became
one
of
reddy
woodpecker
s
favorite
sports
not
only
once
but
several
times
a
day
did
he
go
to
the
hemlock
grove
to
hammer
upon
solomon
s
hollow
tree
and
each
time
that
he
brought
solomon
owl
to
his
door
reddy
woodpecker
laughed
more
loudly
than
ever
before
once
solomon
forgot
to
take
off
his
nightcap
though
he
wore
it
in
the
daytime
it
really
was
a
nightcap
and
reddy
woodpecker
was
so
amused
that
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
what
s
the
joke
asked
solomon
owl
in
his
deep
rumbling
voice
he
tried
to
look
very
severe
but
it
is
hard
to
look
any
way
except
funny
with
a
nightcap
on
one
s
head
as
luck
had
it
jasper
jay
came
hurrying
up
just
then
he
had
heard
reddy
woodpecker
s
laughter
and
if
there
was
a
joke
he
wanted
to
enjoy
it
too
jasper
jay
alighting
in
a
small
hemlock
near
reddy
woodpecker
asked
the
same
question
that
solomon
owl
had
just
put
to
his
rude
caller
what
s
the
joke
inquired
jasper
jay
reddy
could
not
speak
he
was
rocking
back
and
forth
upon
a
limb
choking
and
gasping
for
breath
but
he
managed
to
point
to
the
big
tree
where
solomon
owl
lived
and
when
jasper
looked
and
saw
solomon
s
great
round
pale
questioning
face
all
tied
up
in
a
red
nightcap
he
began
to
scream
they
were
no
ordinary
shrieks
of
jasper
jay
s
that
rascal
was
the
noisiest
of
all
the
feathered
folk
in
pleasant
valley
and
now
he
fairly
made
the
woods
echo
with
his
hoarse
cries
this
is
the
funniest
sight
i
ve
ever
seen
jasper
jay
said
at
last
to
nobody
in
particular
i
declare
there
s
a
pair
of
them
at
that
reddy
woodpecker
suddenly
stopped
laughing
a
pair
of
what
he
asked
a
pair
of
of
course
jasper
jay
replied
you
ve
a
red
so
has
he
jasper
pointed
at
solomon
owl
a
very
rude
thing
to
do
then
two
things
happened
all
at
once
solomon
owl
snatched
off
his
red
he
had
quite
forgotten
and
reddy
woodpecker
dashed
at
jasper
jay
he
couldn
t
pull
off
red
cap
for
it
grew
right
on
his
head
so
that
s
what
you
re
laughing
at
is
it
he
cried
angrily
and
then
nobody
laughed
any
is
nobody
but
solomon
owl
solomon
was
so
pleased
by
the
fight
that
followed
between
jasper
jay
and
reddy
woodpecker
that
his
deep
rumbling
laughter
could
be
heard
for
half
an
if
it
midday
the
sound
reached
the
ears
of
farmer
green
who
was
just
crossing
a
neighboring
field
on
his
way
home
to
dinner
well
well
he
exclaimed
i
wonder
what
s
happened
to
that
old
owl
something
must
have
tickled
i
never
heard
an
owl
laugh
in
broad
daylight
xxi
at
home
in
the
haystack
after
what
happened
when
he
came
to
his
door
without
remembering
to
take
off
his
red
nightcap
solomon
owl
hoped
that
reddy
woodpecker
would
stop
teasing
him
but
it
was
not
so
having
once
viewed
solomon
s
red
cap
reddy
woodpecker
wanted
to
see
it
some
more
so
he
came
again
and
again
and
knocked
on
solomon
s
door
solomon
owl
however
remembered
each
time
to
remove
his
nightcap
before
sticking
his
head
out
and
it
might
be
said
that
neither
of
them
was
exactly
pleased
for
reddy
woodpecker
was
disappointed
and
solomon
owl
was
angry
not
a
day
passed
that
reddy
woodpecker
didn
t
disturb
solomon
s
rest
at
least
a
dozen
times
perhaps
if
solomon
had
just
kept
still
inside
his
house
reddy
would
have
grown
tired
of
bothering
him
but
solomon
all
he
looked
so
thought
of
that
but
he
saw
before
a
great
while
that
he
would
have
to
make
a
change
of
some
he
wanted
to
enjoy
a
good
quiet
sleep
again
for
a
long
time
solomon
owl
pondered
it
was
a
great
know
just
how
to
outwit
reddy
woodpecker
and
solomon
almost
despaired
of
finding
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
at
last
an
idea
came
to
him
all
in
a
flash
he
would
take
his
daytime
naps
somewhere
else
solomon
spent
several
nights
looking
for
a
good
place
to
pass
his
days
and
in
the
end
he
decided
on
the
meadow
it
would
be
convenient
he
thought
when
he
was
hunting
meadow
mice
at
dawn
if
he
could
stay
right
there
without
bothering
to
go
into
the
woods
to
sleep
since
there
were
no
trees
in
the
meadow
but
only
a
few
scrubby
bushes
along
the
stone
wall
one
might
naturally
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
there
could
not
possibly
be
a
nook
of
any
kind
that
would
suit
solomon
owl
who
could
never
sleep
soundly
unless
his
bedroom
was
quite
dark
but
there
was
one
hiding
place
that
solomon
liked
almost
as
well
as
his
home
in
the
hollow
hemlock
and
that
was
farmer
green
s
haystack
he
burrowed
into
one
side
of
it
and
made
himself
a
snug
chamber
which
was
as
dark
as
a
ever
so
much
quieter
what
pleased
solomon
most
however
was
this
nobody
knew
about
that
new
retreat
except
himself
even
if
reddy
woodpecker
should
succeed
in
finding
it
he
never
could
disturb
solomon
by
drumming
upon
the
haystack
if
reddy
tried
that
trick
his
bill
would
merely
sink
noiselessly
into
the
hay
so
solomon
owl
at
last
had
a
good
day
s
rest
and
when
he
met
reddy
woodpecker
just
after
sunset
solomon
was
feeling
so
cheerful
that
he
said
quite
pleasantly
before
he
remembered
that
it
was
reddy
who
had
teased
him
so
often
reddy
woodpecker
replied
he
seemed
much
surprised
that
solomon
owl
should
be
so
agreeable
can
you
hear
me
reddy
asked
him
perfectly
said
solomon
that
s
strange
reddy
woodpecker
exclaimed
i
was
almost
sure
you
had
suddenly
grown
and
he
could
not
understand
why
solomon
owl
laughed
loud
and
long
solomon
s
laughter
rolled
and
echoed
through
the
woodland
but
reddy
woodpecker
did
not
laugh
at
all
xxii
it
was
solomon
s
fault
reddy
woodpecker
had
a
very
good
reason
for
not
laughing
when
he
met
solomon
owl
of
course
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
solomon
s
new
hiding
place
in
the
haystack
and
that
very
morning
reddy
had
invited
a
party
of
friends
to
go
with
him
to
the
hemlock
grove
where
solomon
owl
had
always
lived
to
have
some
fun
as
reddy
had
explained
for
a
long
time
he
had
knocked
and
hammered
and
pounded
at
solomon
owl
s
door
but
for
once
solomon
s
great
pale
face
did
not
appear
where
s
the
fun
reddy
s
friends
had
wanted
to
know
after
they
had
waited
until
they
were
impatient
and
reddy
woodpecker
could
only
shake
his
head
and
say
i
can
t
understand
it
it
s
never
happened
like
this
before
i
m
afraid
solomon
owl
has
lost
his
reddy
woodpecker
s
friends
were
no
more
polite
than
he
and
they
began
to
jeer
at
him
you
didn
t
hammer
loud
enough
one
of
them
told
him
so
he
set
to
work
again
and
rapped
and
rapped
until
his
head
felt
as
if
it
would
fly
off
and
his
neck
began
to
ache
still
solomon
owl
did
not
appear
and
the
party
broke
up
in
something
very
like
a
quarrel
for
reddy
woodpecker
lost
his
temper
when
his
friends
teased
him
and
a
good
many
unpleasant
remarks
passed
back
and
forth
somehow
reddy
felt
that
it
was
all
solomon
owl
s
fault
because
he
hadn
t
come
to
the
door
of
course
reddy
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
all
that
time
solomon
owl
was
sleeping
peacefully
in
farmer
green
s
haystack
in
the
meadow
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
it
was
a
good
joke
on
reddy
woodpecker
and
though
no
one
had
told
solomon
owl
about
it
he
was
not
so
stupid
that
he
couldn
t
guess
at
least
that
had
happened
solomon
owl
continued
to
have
a
very
pleasant
time
living
in
the
meadow
since
there
were
many
mice
right
close
at
hand
little
by
little
he
visited
the
woods
less
and
less
and
there
came
a
time
at
last
when
he
hardly
left
the
meadow
at
all
not
flying
any
more
than
he
could
help
and
eating
too
much
and
sleeping
very
soundly
each
day
he
grew
stouter
than
ever
until
his
friends
hardly
knew
him
when
they
saw
him
solomon
owl
is
a
s
so
fat
people
began
to
say
but
his
size
never
worried
solomon
owl
in
the
least
when
he
became
too
big
for
his
doorway
in
the
haystack
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
make
the
opening
simpler
than
it
would
have
been
to
make
himself
and
that
was
another
reason
why
he
was
delighted
with
his
new
home
at
last
however
something
happened
to
put
an
end
to
his
lazy
way
of
living
one
day
the
sound
of
men
s
voices
awakened
him
when
he
was
having
a
good
nap
in
the
haystack
and
he
felt
his
bedroom
quiver
as
if
an
earthquake
had
shaken
it
scrambling
to
his
doorway
and
peeping
slyly
out
solomon
saw
a
sight
that
made
him
very
angry
a
hayrack
stood
alongside
the
stack
and
on
it
stood
farmer
green
and
his
hired
man
each
had
a
pitchfork
in
his
hands
with
which
he
tore
great
forkfuls
of
hay
off
the
stack
and
piled
it
upon
the
wagon
solomon
owl
knew
then
that
his
fine
hiding
place
was
going
to
be
spoiled
as
soon
as
the
horses
had
pulled
the
load
of
hay
away
with
farmer
green
and
the
hired
man
riding
on
top
of
it
solomon
owl
crept
out
of
his
snug
bedroom
and
hurried
off
to
the
woods
he
was
so
fat
that
it
was
several
days
before
he
could
squeeze
inside
his
old
home
in
the
hollow
hemlock
and
for
the
time
being
he
had
to
sit
on
a
limb
and
sleep
in
the
daylight
as
best
he
could
but
to
his
surprise
reddy
woodpecker
troubled
him
no
more
reddy
had
drummed
so
hard
on
solomon
s
door
in
the
effort
to
awake
him
when
he
wasn
t
there
that
aunt
polly
woodchuck
told
him
he
would
ruin
his
bill
if
he
didn
t
look
out
and
since
the
warning
thoroughly
alarmed
him
reddy
stopped
visiting
the
hemlock
grove
in
time
solomon
owl
grew
to
look
like
himself
again
and
people
never
really
knew
just
what
had
happened
to
him
but
they
noticed
that
he
always
hooted
angrily
whenever
anybody
mentioned
farmer
green
s
name
