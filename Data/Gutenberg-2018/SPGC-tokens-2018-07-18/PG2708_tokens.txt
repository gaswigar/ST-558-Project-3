early
in
the
month
of
october
colonel
sir
thomas
nevil
a
distinguished
irish
officer
of
the
english
army
alighted
with
his
daughter
at
the
hotel
beauveau
marseilles
on
their
return
from
a
tour
in
italy
the
perpetual
and
universal
admiration
of
enthusiastic
travellers
has
produced
a
sort
of
reaction
and
many
tourists
in
their
desire
to
appear
singular
now
take
the
of
horace
for
their
motto
to
this
dissatisfied
class
the
colonel
s
only
daughter
miss
lydia
belonged
the
transfiguration
has
seemed
to
her
mediocre
and
vesuvius
in
eruption
an
effect
not
greatly
superior
to
that
produced
by
the
birmingham
factory
chimneys
her
great
objection
to
italy
on
the
whole
was
its
lack
of
local
colour
and
character
my
readers
must
discover
the
sense
of
these
expressions
as
best
they
may
a
few
years
ago
i
understood
them
very
well
myself
but
at
the
present
time
i
can
make
nothing
of
them
at
first
miss
lydia
had
flattered
herself
she
had
found
things
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
which
nobody
had
ever
before
seen
about
which
she
could
converse
les
honnetes
as
jourdain
calls
them
but
soon
anticipated
in
every
direction
by
her
countrymen
she
despaired
of
making
any
fresh
discoveries
and
went
over
to
the
party
of
the
opposition
it
is
really
very
tiresome
not
to
be
able
to
talk
abut
the
wonders
of
italy
without
hearing
somebody
say
of
course
you
know
the
raphael
in
the
palazzo
at
it
is
the
finest
thing
in
italy
and
just
the
thing
happen
to
have
overlooked
as
it
would
take
too
long
to
see
everything
the
simplest
course
is
to
resort
to
deliberate
and
universal
censure
at
the
hotel
beauveau
miss
lydia
met
with
a
bitter
disappointment
she
had
brought
back
a
pretty
sketch
of
the
pelasgic
or
cyclopean
gate
at
segni
which
as
she
believed
all
other
artists
had
completely
overlooked
now
at
marseilles
she
met
lady
frances
fenwick
who
showed
her
her
album
in
which
appeared
between
a
sonnet
and
a
dried
flower
the
very
gate
in
question
brilliantly
touched
in
with
sienna
miss
lydia
gave
her
drawing
to
her
maid
and
lost
all
admiration
for
pelasgic
structures
this
unhappy
frame
of
mind
was
shared
by
colonel
nevil
who
since
the
death
of
his
wife
looked
at
everything
through
his
daughter
s
eyes
in
his
estimation
italy
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
of
boring
his
child
and
was
in
consequence
the
most
wearisome
country
on
the
face
of
the
earth
he
had
no
fault
to
find
indeed
with
the
pictures
and
statues
but
he
was
in
a
position
to
assert
that
italian
sport
was
utterly
wretched
and
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
tramp
ten
leagues
over
the
roman
campagna
under
a
burning
sun
to
kill
a
few
worthless
partridges
the
morning
after
his
arrival
at
marseilles
he
invited
captain
ellis
his
former
adjutant
who
had
just
been
spending
six
weeks
in
corsica
to
dine
with
him
the
captain
told
miss
lydia
a
story
about
bandits
which
had
the
advantage
of
bearing
no
resemblance
to
the
robber
tales
with
which
she
had
been
so
frequently
regaled
on
the
road
between
naples
and
rome
and
he
told
it
well
at
dessert
the
two
men
left
alone
over
their
claret
talked
of
hunting
and
the
colonel
learned
that
nowhere
is
there
more
excellent
sport
or
game
more
varied
and
abundant
than
in
corsica
there
are
plenty
of
wild
boars
said
captain
ellis
and
you
have
to
learn
to
distinguish
them
from
the
domestic
pigs
which
are
astonishingly
like
them
for
if
you
kill
a
pig
you
find
yourself
in
difficulties
with
the
they
rush
out
of
the
thickets
which
they
call
armed
to
the
teeth
make
you
pay
for
their
beasts
and
laugh
at
you
besides
then
there
is
the
mouflon
a
strange
animal
which
you
will
not
find
anywhere
else
splendid
game
but
hard
to
get
and
stags
deer
pheasants
and
partridges
it
would
be
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
kinds
with
which
corsica
swarms
if
you
want
shooting
colonel
go
to
corsica
there
as
one
of
my
entertainers
said
to
me
you
can
get
a
shot
at
every
imaginable
kind
of
game
from
a
thrush
to
a
man
at
tea
the
captain
once
more
delighted
lydia
with
the
tale
of
a
a
vendetta
in
which
vengeance
falls
on
a
more
or
less
distant
relation
of
the
author
of
the
original
offence
even
more
strange
than
his
first
story
and
he
thoroughly
stirred
her
enthusiasm
by
his
descriptions
of
the
strange
wild
beauty
of
the
country
the
peculiarities
of
its
inhabitants
and
their
primitive
hospitality
and
customs
finally
he
offered
her
a
pretty
little
stiletto
less
remarkable
for
its
shape
and
copper
mounting
than
for
its
origin
a
famous
bandit
had
given
it
to
captain
ellis
and
had
assured
him
it
had
been
buried
in
four
human
bodies
miss
lydia
thrust
it
through
her
girdle
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
her
bed
and
unsheathed
it
twice
over
before
she
fell
asleep
her
father
meanwhile
was
dreaming
he
had
slain
a
mouflon
and
that
its
owner
insisted
on
his
paying
for
it
a
demand
to
which
he
gladly
acceded
seeing
it
was
a
most
curious
creature
like
a
boar
with
stag
s
horns
and
a
pheasant
s
tail
ellis
tells
me
there
s
splendid
shooting
in
corsica
said
the
colonel
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
alone
with
his
daughter
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
distance
i
should
like
to
spend
a
fortnight
well
replied
miss
lydia
why
shouldn
t
we
go
to
corsica
while
you
are
hunting
i
can
sketch
i
should
love
to
have
that
grotto
captain
ellis
talked
about
where
napoleon
used
to
go
and
study
when
he
was
a
child
in
my
it
was
the
first
time
probably
that
any
wish
expressed
by
the
colonel
had
won
his
daughter
s
approbation
delighted
as
he
was
by
the
unexpected
harmony
on
their
opinions
he
was
nevertheless
wise
enough
to
put
forward
various
objections
calculated
to
sharpen
miss
lydia
s
welcome
whim
in
vain
did
he
dwell
on
the
wildness
of
the
country
and
the
difficulties
of
travel
there
for
a
lady
nothing
frightened
her
she
liked
travelling
on
horseback
of
all
things
she
delighted
in
the
idea
of
bivouacking
in
the
open
she
even
threatened
to
go
as
far
as
asia
minor
in
short
she
found
an
answer
to
everything
no
englishwoman
had
ever
been
to
corsica
therefore
she
must
go
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
when
she
got
back
to
james
s
place
to
exhibit
her
album
but
my
dear
creature
why
do
you
pass
over
that
delightful
drawing
that
s
only
a
trifle
just
a
sketch
i
made
of
a
famous
corsican
bandit
who
was
our
what
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
have
been
to
corsica
as
there
were
no
steamboats
between
france
and
corsica
in
those
days
inquiries
were
made
for
some
ship
about
to
sail
for
the
island
miss
lydia
proposed
to
discover
that
very
day
the
colonel
wrote
to
paris
to
countermand
his
order
for
the
suite
of
apartments
in
which
he
was
to
have
made
some
stay
and
bargained
with
the
skipper
of
a
corsican
schooner
just
about
to
set
sail
for
ajaccio
for
two
poor
cabins
but
the
best
that
could
be
had
provisions
were
sent
on
board
the
skipper
swore
that
one
of
his
sailors
was
an
excellent
cook
and
had
not
his
equal
for
he
promised
mademoiselle
should
be
comfortable
and
have
a
fair
wind
and
a
calm
sea
the
colonel
further
stipulated
in
obedience
to
his
daughter
s
wishes
that
no
other
passenger
should
be
taken
on
board
and
that
the
captain
should
skirt
the
coast
of
the
island
so
that
miss
lydia
might
enjoy
the
view
of
the
mountains
chapter
ii
on
the
day
of
their
departure
everything
was
packed
and
sent
on
board
early
in
the
morning
the
schooner
was
to
sail
with
the
evening
breeze
meanwhile
as
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
were
walking
on
the
canebiere
the
skipper
addressed
them
and
craved
permission
to
take
on
board
one
of
his
relations
his
eldest
son
s
godfather
s
second
cousin
who
was
going
back
to
corsica
his
native
country
on
important
business
and
could
not
find
any
ship
to
take
him
over
he
s
a
charming
fellow
added
captain
mattei
a
soldier
an
officer
in
the
infantry
of
the
guard
and
would
have
been
a
colonel
already
if
meaning
napoleon
had
still
been
emperor
as
he
is
a
soldier
began
the
colonel
he
was
about
to
add
i
shall
be
very
glad
he
should
come
with
us
when
miss
lydia
exclaimed
in
english
an
infantry
officer
her
father
had
been
in
the
cavalry
and
she
consequently
looked
down
on
every
other
branch
of
the
service
an
uneducated
man
very
likely
who
would
be
and
spoil
all
the
pleasure
of
our
trip
the
captain
did
not
understand
a
word
of
english
but
he
seemed
to
catch
what
miss
lydia
was
saying
by
the
pursing
up
of
her
pretty
mouth
and
immediately
entered
upon
an
elaborate
panegyric
of
his
relative
which
he
wound
up
by
declaring
him
to
be
a
gentleman
belonging
to
a
family
of
and
that
he
would
not
be
in
the
very
least
in
the
colonel
s
way
for
that
he
the
skipper
would
undertake
to
stow
him
in
some
corner
where
they
should
not
be
aware
of
his
presence
the
colonel
and
miss
nevil
thought
it
peculiar
that
there
should
be
corsican
families
in
which
the
dignity
of
corporal
was
handed
down
from
father
to
son
but
as
they
really
believed
the
individual
in
question
to
be
some
infantry
corporal
they
concluded
he
was
some
poor
devil
whom
the
skipper
desired
to
take
out
of
pure
charity
if
he
had
been
an
officer
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
speak
to
him
and
live
with
him
but
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
put
themselves
out
for
a
corporal
who
is
a
person
of
no
consequence
unless
his
detachment
is
also
at
hand
with
bayonets
fixed
ready
to
convey
a
person
to
a
place
to
which
he
would
rather
not
be
taken
is
your
kinsman
ever
demanded
miss
nevil
sharply
never
mademoiselle
he
is
as
steady
as
a
rock
either
on
sea
or
land
very
good
then
you
can
take
him
said
she
you
can
take
him
echoed
the
colonel
and
they
passed
on
their
way
toward
five
o
clock
in
the
evening
captain
mattei
came
to
escort
them
on
board
the
schooner
on
the
jetty
near
the
captain
s
gig
they
met
a
tall
young
man
wearing
a
blue
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
his
face
was
tanned
his
eyes
were
black
brilliant
wide
open
his
whole
appearance
intelligent
and
frank
his
shoulders
well
thrown
back
and
his
little
twisted
mustache
clearly
revealed
the
soldier
for
at
that
period
mustaches
were
by
no
means
common
and
the
national
guard
had
not
carried
the
habits
and
appearance
of
the
into
the
bosom
of
every
family
when
the
young
man
saw
the
colonel
he
doffed
his
cap
and
thanked
him
in
excellent
language
and
without
the
slightest
shyness
for
the
service
he
was
rendering
him
delighted
to
be
of
use
to
you
my
good
fellow
said
the
colonel
with
a
friendly
nod
and
he
stepped
into
the
gig
he
s
not
very
ceremonious
this
englishman
of
yours
said
the
young
man
in
italian
and
in
an
undertone
to
the
captain
the
skipper
laid
his
forefinger
under
his
left
eye
and
pulled
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
to
a
man
acquainted
with
the
language
of
signs
this
meant
that
the
englishman
understood
italian
and
was
an
oddity
into
the
bargain
the
young
man
smiled
slightly
and
touched
his
forehead
in
answer
to
mattei
s
sign
as
though
to
indicate
that
every
englishman
had
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
then
he
sat
down
beside
them
and
began
to
look
very
attentively
though
not
impertinently
at
his
pretty
these
french
soldiers
all
have
a
good
appearance
remarked
the
colonel
in
english
to
his
daughter
and
so
it
is
easy
to
turn
them
into
then
addressing
the
young
man
in
french
he
said
tell
me
my
good
man
what
regiment
have
you
served
in
the
young
man
nudged
his
second
cousin
s
godson
s
father
gently
with
his
elbow
and
suppressing
an
ironic
smile
replied
that
he
had
served
in
the
infantry
of
the
guard
and
that
he
had
just
quitted
the
seventh
regiment
of
light
infantry
were
you
at
waterloo
you
are
very
young
i
beg
your
pardon
colonel
that
was
my
only
it
counts
as
two
said
the
colonel
the
young
corsican
bit
his
lips
papa
said
miss
lydia
in
english
do
ask
him
if
the
corsicans
are
very
fond
of
their
before
the
colonel
could
translate
her
question
into
french
the
young
man
answered
in
fairly
good
english
though
with
a
marked
accent
you
know
mademoiselle
that
no
man
is
ever
a
prophet
in
his
own
country
we
who
are
napoleon
s
are
perhaps
less
attached
to
him
than
the
french
as
for
myself
though
my
family
was
formerly
at
enmity
with
his
i
both
love
and
admire
you
speak
english
exclaimed
the
colonel
very
ill
as
you
may
perceive
miss
lydia
though
somewhat
shocked
by
the
young
man
s
easy
tone
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
idea
of
a
personal
enmity
between
a
corporal
and
an
emperor
she
took
this
as
a
foretaste
of
corsican
peculiarities
and
made
up
her
mind
to
note
it
down
in
her
journal
perhaps
you
were
a
prisoner
in
england
asked
the
colonel
no
colonel
i
learned
english
in
france
when
i
was
very
young
from
a
prisoner
of
your
then
addressing
miss
nevil
mattei
tells
me
you
have
just
come
back
from
italy
no
doubt
mademoiselle
you
speak
the
purest
tuscan
i
fear
you
ll
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
understand
our
my
daughter
understands
every
italian
dialect
said
the
colonel
she
has
the
gift
of
languages
she
doesn
t
get
it
from
would
mademoiselle
understand
for
instance
these
lines
from
one
of
our
corsican
songs
in
which
a
shepherd
says
to
his
shepherdess
s
entrassi
ndru
paradisu
santu
santu
e
nun
truvassi
a
tia
mi
n
if
i
entered
the
holy
land
of
paradise
and
found
thee
not
i
would
depart
di
miss
lydia
did
understand
she
thought
the
quotation
bold
and
the
look
which
accompanied
it
still
bolder
and
replied
with
a
blush
and
are
you
going
back
to
your
own
country
on
furlough
inquired
the
colonel
no
colonel
they
have
put
me
on
because
i
was
at
waterloo
probably
and
because
i
am
napoleon
s
i
am
going
home
as
the
song
says
low
in
hope
and
low
in
purse
and
he
looked
up
to
the
sky
and
sighed
the
colonel
slipped
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
tried
to
think
of
some
civil
phrase
with
which
he
might
slip
the
gold
coin
he
was
fingering
into
the
palm
of
his
unfortunate
enemy
and
i
too
he
said
have
been
put
on
but
your
can
hardly
give
you
enough
to
buy
tobacco
here
corporal
and
he
tried
to
force
the
gold
coin
into
the
young
man
s
closed
hand
which
rested
on
the
gunwale
of
the
gig
the
young
corsican
reddened
drew
himself
up
bit
his
lips
and
seemed
for
a
moment
on
the
brink
of
some
angry
reply
then
suddenly
his
expression
changed
and
he
burst
out
laughing
the
colonel
grasping
his
gold
piece
still
in
his
hand
sat
staring
at
him
colonel
said
the
young
man
when
he
had
recovered
his
gravity
allow
me
to
offer
you
two
pieces
of
advice
the
first
is
never
to
offer
money
to
a
corsican
for
some
of
my
would
be
rude
enough
to
throw
it
back
in
your
face
the
second
is
not
to
give
people
titles
they
do
not
claim
you
call
me
corporal
and
i
am
a
lieutenant
the
difference
is
not
very
great
no
doubt
still
lieutenant
lieutenant
exclaimed
sir
thomas
but
the
skipper
told
me
you
were
a
corporal
and
that
your
father
and
all
your
family
had
been
corporals
before
you
at
these
words
the
young
man
threw
himself
back
and
laughed
louder
than
ever
so
merrily
that
the
skipper
and
his
two
sailors
joined
the
chorus
forgive
me
colonel
he
cried
at
last
the
mistake
is
so
comical
and
i
have
only
just
realized
it
it
is
quite
true
that
my
family
glories
in
the
fact
that
it
can
reckon
many
corporals
among
its
ancestors
but
our
corsican
corporals
never
wore
stripes
upon
their
sleeves
toward
the
year
of
grace
certain
villages
revolted
against
the
tyranny
of
the
great
mountain
nobles
and
chose
leaders
of
their
own
whom
they
called
in
our
island
we
think
a
great
deal
of
being
descended
from
these
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
exclaimed
the
colonel
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
as
you
understand
the
cause
of
my
mistake
i
hope
you
will
do
me
the
kindness
of
forgiving
it
and
he
held
out
his
hand
it
is
the
just
punishment
of
my
petty
pride
said
the
young
man
still
laughing
and
cordially
shaking
the
englishman
s
hand
i
am
not
at
all
offended
as
my
friend
mattei
has
introduced
me
so
unsuccessfully
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
my
name
is
orso
della
rebbia
i
am
a
lieutenant
on
and
if
as
the
sight
of
those
two
fine
dogs
of
yours
leads
me
to
believe
you
are
coming
to
corsica
to
hunt
i
shall
be
very
proud
to
do
you
the
honours
of
our
mountains
and
our
if
indeed
i
have
not
forgotten
them
altogether
he
added
with
a
sigh
at
this
moment
the
gig
came
alongside
the
schooner
the
lieutenant
offered
his
hand
to
miss
lydia
and
then
helped
the
colonel
to
swing
himself
up
on
deck
once
there
sir
thomas
who
was
still
very
much
ashamed
of
his
blunder
and
at
a
loss
to
know
what
he
had
better
do
to
make
the
man
whose
ancestry
dated
from
the
year
forget
it
invited
him
to
supper
without
waiting
for
his
daughter
s
consent
and
with
many
fresh
apologies
and
handshakes
miss
lydia
frowned
a
little
but
after
all
she
was
not
sorry
to
know
what
a
corporal
really
was
she
rather
liked
there
guest
and
was
even
beginning
to
fancy
there
was
something
aristocratic
about
him
only
she
thought
him
too
frank
and
merry
for
a
hero
of
romance
lieutenant
della
rebbia
said
the
colonel
bowing
to
him
english
fashion
over
a
glass
of
madeira
i
met
a
great
many
of
your
countrymen
in
spain
they
were
splendid
yes
and
a
great
many
of
them
have
stayed
in
spain
replied
the
young
lieutenant
gravely
i
shall
never
forget
the
behaviour
of
a
corsican
battalion
at
the
battle
of
vittoria
said
the
colonel
i
have
good
reason
to
remember
it
indeed
he
added
rubbing
his
chest
all
day
long
they
had
been
skirmishing
in
the
gardens
behind
the
hedges
and
had
killed
i
don
t
know
how
many
of
our
horses
and
men
when
the
retreat
was
sounded
they
rallied
and
made
off
at
a
great
pace
we
had
hoped
to
take
our
revenge
on
them
in
the
open
plain
but
the
scoundrels
i
beg
your
pardon
lieutenant
the
brave
fellows
i
should
have
said
had
formed
a
square
and
there
was
no
breaking
it
in
the
middle
of
the
square
i
fancy
i
can
see
him
still
rode
an
officer
on
a
little
black
horse
he
kept
close
beside
the
standard
smoking
his
cigar
as
coolly
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
café
every
now
and
then
their
bugles
played
a
flourish
as
if
to
defy
us
i
sent
my
two
leading
squadrons
at
them
whew
instead
of
breaking
the
front
of
the
square
my
dragoons
passed
along
the
sides
wheeled
and
came
back
in
great
disorder
and
with
several
riderless
horses
and
all
the
time
those
cursed
bugles
went
on
playing
when
the
smoke
which
had
hung
over
the
battalion
cleared
away
i
saw
the
officer
still
puffing
at
his
cigar
beside
his
eagle
i
was
furious
and
led
a
final
charge
myself
their
muskets
foul
with
continual
firing
would
not
go
off
but
the
men
had
drawn
up
six
deep
with
their
bayonets
pointed
at
the
noses
of
our
horses
you
might
have
taken
them
for
a
wall
i
was
shouting
urging
on
my
dragoons
and
spurring
my
horse
forward
when
the
officer
i
have
mentioned
at
length
throwing
away
his
cigar
pointed
me
out
to
one
of
his
men
and
i
heard
him
say
something
like
al
capello
bianco
i
wore
a
white
plume
then
i
did
not
hear
any
more
for
a
bullet
passed
through
my
chest
that
was
a
splendid
battalion
della
rebbia
that
first
battalion
of
the
eighteenth
all
of
them
corsicans
as
i
was
afterward
told
yes
said
orso
whose
eyes
had
shone
as
he
listened
to
the
story
they
covered
the
retreat
and
brought
back
their
eagle
two
thirds
of
those
brave
fellows
are
sleeping
now
on
the
plains
of
vittoria
and
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
the
name
of
the
officer
in
command
it
was
my
father
he
was
then
a
major
in
the
eighteenth
and
was
promoted
colonel
for
his
conduct
on
that
terrible
your
father
upon
my
word
he
was
a
brave
man
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
again
and
i
am
certain
i
should
recognise
him
is
he
still
alive
no
colonel
said
the
young
man
turning
slightly
pale
was
he
at
waterloo
yes
colonel
but
he
had
not
the
happiness
of
dying
on
the
field
of
battle
he
died
in
corsica
two
years
ago
how
beautiful
the
sea
is
it
is
ten
years
since
i
have
seen
the
mediterranean
don
t
you
think
the
mediterranean
much
more
beautiful
than
the
ocean
mademoiselle
i
think
it
too
blue
and
its
waves
lack
you
like
wild
beauty
then
mademoiselle
in
that
case
i
am
sure
you
will
be
delighted
with
my
daughter
said
the
colonel
delights
in
everything
that
is
out
of
the
common
and
for
that
reason
she
did
not
care
much
for
the
only
place
in
italy
that
i
know
said
orso
is
pisa
where
i
was
at
school
for
some
time
but
i
can
not
think
without
admiration
of
the
the
duomo
and
the
leaning
tower
especially
of
the
do
you
remember
orcagna
s
death
i
think
i
could
draw
every
line
of
it
it
is
so
graven
on
my
miss
lydia
was
afraid
the
lieutenant
was
going
to
deliver
an
enthusiastic
tirade
it
is
very
pretty
she
said
with
a
yawn
excuse
me
papa
my
head
aches
a
little
i
am
going
down
to
my
she
kissed
her
father
on
the
forehead
inclined
her
head
majestically
to
orso
and
disappeared
then
the
two
men
talked
about
hunting
and
war
they
discovered
that
at
waterloo
they
had
been
posted
opposite
each
other
and
had
no
doubt
exchanged
many
a
bullet
this
knowledge
strengthened
their
good
understanding
turning
about
they
criticised
napoleon
wellington
and
blucher
and
then
they
hunted
buck
boar
and
mountain
sheep
in
company
at
last
when
night
was
far
advanced
and
the
last
bottle
of
claret
had
been
emptied
the
colonel
wrung
the
lieutenant
s
hand
once
more
and
wished
him
expressing
his
hope
that
an
acquaintance
which
had
begun
in
such
ridiculous
fashion
might
be
continued
they
parted
and
each
went
to
bed
chapter
iii
it
was
a
lovely
night
the
moonlight
was
dancing
on
the
waves
the
ship
glided
smoothly
on
before
a
gentle
breeze
miss
lydia
was
not
sleepy
and
nothing
but
the
presence
of
an
unpoetical
person
had
prevented
her
from
enjoying
those
emotions
which
every
human
being
possessing
a
touch
of
poetry
must
experience
at
sea
by
moonlight
when
she
felt
sure
the
young
lieutenant
must
be
sound
asleep
like
the
prosaic
creature
he
was
she
got
up
took
her
cloak
woke
her
maid
and
went
on
deck
nobody
was
to
be
seen
except
the
sailor
at
the
helm
who
was
singing
a
sort
of
dirge
in
the
corsican
dialect
to
some
wild
and
monotonous
tune
in
the
silence
of
the
night
this
strange
music
had
its
charm
unluckily
miss
lydia
did
not
understand
perfectly
what
the
sailor
was
singing
amid
a
good
deal
that
was
commonplace
a
passionate
line
would
occasionally
excite
her
liveliest
curiosity
but
just
at
the
most
important
moment
some
words
of
would
occur
the
sense
of
which
utterly
escaped
her
yet
she
did
make
out
that
the
subject
was
connected
with
a
murder
curses
against
the
assassin
threats
of
vengeance
praise
of
the
dead
were
all
mingled
confusedly
she
remembered
some
of
the
lines
i
will
endeavour
to
translate
them
here
neither
cannon
nor
bayonets
brought
pallor
to
his
brow
as
serene
on
the
battlefield
as
a
summer
sky
he
was
the
falcon
the
eagle
s
friend
honey
of
the
sand
to
his
friends
to
his
enemies
a
tempestuous
sea
prouder
than
the
sun
gentler
than
the
moon
he
for
whom
the
enemies
of
france
never
waited
murderers
in
his
own
land
struck
him
from
behind
as
vittolo
slew
sampiero
corso
never
would
they
have
dared
to
look
him
in
the
face
set
up
on
the
wall
before
my
bed
my
cross
of
honour
red
is
its
ribbon
redder
is
my
shirt
for
my
son
my
son
in
a
far
country
keep
my
cross
and
my
shirt
he
will
see
two
holes
in
it
for
each
hole
a
hole
in
another
shirt
but
will
that
accomplish
the
vengeance
i
must
have
the
hand
that
fired
the
eye
that
aimed
the
heart
that
planned
suddenly
the
sailor
stopped
short
why
don
t
you
go
on
my
good
man
inquired
miss
nevil
the
sailor
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
pointed
to
a
figure
appearing
through
the
main
hatchway
of
the
schooner
it
was
orso
coming
up
to
enjoy
the
moonlight
pray
finish
your
song
said
miss
lydia
it
interests
me
greatly
the
sailor
leaned
toward
her
and
said
in
a
very
low
tone
i
don
t
give
the
to
anybody
the
what
the
sailor
without
replying
began
to
whistle
i
have
caught
you
admiring
our
mediterranean
miss
nevil
said
orso
coming
toward
her
you
must
allow
you
never
see
a
moon
like
this
anywhere
else
i
was
not
looking
at
it
i
was
altogether
occupied
in
studying
corsican
that
sailor
who
has
been
singing
a
most
tragic
dirge
stopped
short
at
the
most
interesting
the
sailor
bent
down
as
if
to
see
the
compass
more
clearly
and
tugged
sharply
at
miss
nevil
s
fur
cloak
it
was
quite
evident
his
lament
could
not
be
sung
before
lieutenant
orso
what
were
you
singing
paolo
france
said
orso
was
it
a
or
a
mademoiselle
understands
you
and
would
like
to
hear
the
i
have
forgotten
it
ors
anton
said
the
sailor
and
instantly
he
began
a
hymn
to
the
virgin
at
the
top
of
his
voice
miss
lydia
listened
to
the
hymn
and
did
not
press
the
singer
any
further
though
she
was
quite
resolved
in
her
own
mind
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
the
riddle
later
but
her
maid
who
being
a
florentine
could
not
understand
the
corsican
dialect
any
better
than
her
mistress
was
as
eager
as
miss
lydia
for
information
and
turning
to
orso
before
the
english
lady
could
warn
her
by
a
nudge
she
said
captain
what
does
the
mean
the
rimbecco
said
orso
why
it
s
the
most
deadly
insult
that
can
be
offered
to
a
corsican
it
means
reproaching
him
with
not
having
avenged
his
wrong
who
mentioned
the
rimbecco
to
you
yesterday
at
marseilles
replied
miss
lydia
hurriedly
the
captain
of
the
schooner
used
the
and
whom
was
he
talking
about
inquired
orso
eagerly
oh
he
was
telling
us
some
odd
story
about
the
time
yes
i
think
it
was
about
vannina
d
i
suppose
mademoiselle
that
vannina
s
death
has
not
inspired
you
with
any
great
love
for
our
national
hero
the
brave
sampiero
but
do
you
think
his
conduct
was
so
very
heroic
the
excuse
for
his
crime
lies
in
the
savage
customs
of
the
period
and
then
sampiero
was
waging
deadly
war
against
the
genoese
what
confidence
could
his
have
felt
in
him
if
he
had
not
punished
his
wife
who
tried
to
treat
with
genoa
vannina
said
the
sailor
had
started
off
without
her
husband
s
leave
sampiero
did
quite
right
to
wring
her
neck
but
said
miss
lydia
it
was
to
save
her
husband
it
was
out
of
love
for
him
that
she
was
going
to
ask
his
pardon
from
the
to
ask
his
pardon
was
to
degrade
him
exclaimed
orso
and
then
to
kill
her
himself
said
miss
lydia
what
a
monster
he
must
have
been
you
know
she
begged
as
a
favour
that
she
might
die
by
his
hand
what
about
othello
mademoiselle
do
you
look
on
him
too
as
a
monster
there
is
a
difference
he
was
jealous
sampiero
was
only
vain
and
after
all
is
not
jealousy
a
kind
of
vanity
it
is
the
vanity
of
love
will
you
not
excuse
it
on
account
of
its
motive
miss
lydia
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
great
dignity
and
turning
to
the
sailor
inquired
when
the
schooner
would
reach
port
the
day
after
said
he
if
the
wind
i
wish
ajaccio
were
in
sight
already
for
i
am
sick
of
this
she
rose
took
her
maid
s
arm
and
walked
a
few
paces
on
the
deck
orso
stood
motionless
beside
the
helm
not
knowing
whether
he
had
better
walk
beside
her
or
end
a
conversation
which
seemed
displeasing
to
her
blood
of
the
madonna
what
a
handsome
girl
said
the
sailor
if
every
flea
in
my
bed
were
like
her
i
shouldn
t
complain
of
their
biting
me
miss
lydia
may
possibly
have
overheard
this
artless
praise
of
her
beauty
and
been
startled
by
it
for
she
went
below
almost
immediately
shortly
after
orso
also
retired
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
deck
the
maid
reappeared
and
having
the
sailor
carried
back
the
following
information
to
her
mistress
the
which
had
been
broken
off
on
orso
s
appearance
had
been
composed
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
his
father
colonel
della
rebbia
who
had
been
murdered
two
years
previously
the
sailor
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
orso
was
coming
back
to
corsica
fare
la
such
was
his
expression
and
he
affirmed
that
before
long
there
would
be
to
be
seen
in
the
village
of
pietranera
this
national
expression
being
interpreted
meant
that
signor
orso
proposed
to
murder
two
or
three
individuals
suspected
of
having
assassinated
his
father
individuals
who
had
indeed
been
prosecuted
on
that
account
but
had
come
out
of
the
trial
as
white
as
snow
for
they
were
hand
and
glove
with
the
judges
lawyers
prefect
and
gendarmes
there
is
no
justice
in
corsica
added
the
sailor
and
i
put
much
more
faith
in
a
good
gun
than
in
a
judge
of
the
royal
court
if
a
man
has
an
enemy
he
must
choose
one
of
the
three
s
a
national
expression
meaning
that
is
or
these
interesting
pieces
of
information
wrought
a
notable
change
in
miss
lydia
s
manner
and
feeling
with
regard
to
lieutenant
della
rebbia
from
that
moment
he
became
a
person
of
importance
in
the
romantic
englishwoman
s
eyes
his
careless
air
his
frank
and
good
humour
which
had
at
first
impressed
her
so
unfavourably
now
seemed
to
her
an
additional
merit
as
being
proofs
of
the
deep
dissimulation
of
a
strong
nature
which
will
not
allow
any
inner
feeling
to
appear
upon
the
surface
orso
seemed
to
her
a
sort
of
fieschi
who
hid
mighty
designs
under
an
appearance
of
frivolity
and
though
it
is
less
noble
to
kill
a
few
rascals
than
to
free
one
s
country
still
a
fine
deed
of
vengeance
is
a
fine
thing
and
besides
women
are
rather
glad
to
find
their
hero
is
not
a
politician
then
miss
nevil
remarked
for
the
first
time
that
the
young
lieutenant
had
large
eyes
white
teeth
an
elegant
figure
that
he
was
and
possessed
the
habits
of
good
society
during
the
following
day
she
talked
to
him
frequently
and
found
his
conversation
interesting
he
was
asked
many
questions
about
his
own
country
and
described
it
well
corsica
which
he
had
left
when
young
to
go
first
to
college
and
then
to
the
ecole
militaire
had
remained
in
his
imagination
surrounded
with
poetic
associations
when
he
talked
of
its
mountains
its
forests
and
the
quaint
customs
of
its
inhabitants
he
grew
eager
and
animated
as
may
be
imagined
the
word
occurred
more
than
once
in
the
stories
he
told
for
it
is
impossible
to
speak
of
the
corsicans
without
either
attacking
or
justifying
their
proverbial
passion
orso
somewhat
surprised
miss
nevil
by
his
general
condemnation
of
the
undying
hatreds
nursed
by
his
as
regarded
the
peasants
however
he
endeavoured
to
excuse
them
and
claimed
that
the
is
the
poor
man
s
duel
so
true
is
this
he
said
that
no
assassination
takes
place
till
a
formal
challenge
has
been
delivered
be
on
your
guard
yourself
i
am
on
mine
are
the
sacramental
words
exchanged
from
time
immemorial
between
two
enemies
before
they
begin
to
lie
in
wait
for
each
other
there
are
more
assassinations
among
us
he
added
than
anywhere
else
but
you
will
never
discover
an
ignoble
cause
for
any
of
these
crimes
we
have
many
murderers
it
is
true
but
not
a
single
when
he
spoke
about
vengeance
and
murder
miss
lydia
looked
at
him
closely
but
she
could
not
detect
the
slightest
trace
of
emotion
on
his
features
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
however
that
he
possessed
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
be
able
to
hide
his
thoughts
from
every
eye
her
own
of
course
excepted
she
continued
in
her
firm
belief
that
colonel
della
rebbia
s
shade
would
not
have
to
wait
long
for
the
atonement
it
claimed
the
schooner
was
already
within
sight
of
corsica
the
captain
pointed
out
the
principal
features
of
the
coast
and
though
all
of
these
were
absolutely
unknown
to
miss
lydia
she
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
hearing
their
names
nothing
is
more
tiresome
than
an
anonymous
landscape
from
time
to
time
the
colonel
s
telescope
revealed
to
her
the
form
of
some
islander
clad
in
brown
cloth
armed
with
a
long
gun
bestriding
a
small
horse
and
galloping
down
steep
slopes
in
each
of
these
miss
lydia
believed
she
beheld
either
a
brigand
or
a
son
going
forth
to
avenge
his
father
s
death
but
orso
always
declared
it
was
some
peaceful
denizen
of
a
neighbouring
village
travelling
on
business
and
that
he
carried
a
gun
less
from
necessity
than
because
it
was
the
fashion
just
as
no
dandy
ever
takes
a
walk
without
an
elegant
cane
though
a
gun
is
a
less
noble
and
poetic
weapon
than
a
stiletto
miss
lydia
thought
it
much
more
stylish
for
a
man
than
any
cane
and
she
remembered
that
all
lord
byron
s
heroes
died
by
a
bullet
and
not
by
the
classic
poniard
after
three
days
sailing
the
ship
reached
les
sanguinaires
the
bloody
islands
and
the
magnificent
panorama
of
the
gulf
of
ajaccio
was
unrolled
before
our
travellers
eyes
it
is
compared
with
justice
to
the
bay
of
naples
and
just
as
the
schooner
was
entering
the
harbour
a
burning
which
covered
the
punta
di
girato
brought
back
memories
of
vesuvius
and
heightened
the
resemblance
to
make
it
quite
complete
naples
should
be
seen
after
one
of
attila
s
armies
had
devastated
its
suburbs
for
round
ajaccio
everything
looks
dead
and
deserted
instead
of
the
handsome
buildings
observable
on
every
side
from
castellamare
to
cape
misena
nothing
is
to
be
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
gulf
of
ajaccio
but
gloomy
with
bare
mountains
rising
behind
them
not
a
villa
not
a
dwelling
of
any
kind
only
here
and
there
on
the
heights
about
the
town
a
few
isolated
white
structures
stand
out
against
a
background
of
green
these
are
mortuary
chapels
or
family
tombs
everything
in
this
landscape
is
gravely
and
sadly
beautiful
the
appearance
of
the
town
at
that
period
especially
deepened
the
impression
caused
by
the
loneliness
of
its
surroundings
there
was
no
stir
in
the
streets
where
only
a
few
listless
idlers
always
the
same
were
to
be
seen
no
women
at
all
except
an
odd
peasant
come
in
to
sell
her
produce
no
loud
talk
laughter
and
singing
as
in
the
italian
towns
sometimes
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
on
the
public
promenade
a
dozen
armed
peasants
will
play
at
cards
or
watch
each
other
play
they
never
shout
or
wrangle
if
they
get
hot
over
the
game
pistol
shots
ring
out
and
this
always
before
the
utterance
of
any
threat
the
corsican
is
grave
and
silent
by
nature
in
the
evening
a
few
persons
come
out
to
enjoy
the
cool
air
but
the
promenaders
on
the
corso
are
nearly
all
of
them
foreigners
the
islanders
stay
in
front
of
their
own
doors
each
one
seems
on
the
watch
like
a
falcon
over
its
nest
chapter
iv
when
miss
lydia
had
visited
the
house
in
which
napoleon
was
born
and
had
procured
by
means
more
or
less
moral
a
fragment
of
the
belonging
to
it
she
within
two
days
of
her
landing
in
corsica
began
to
feel
that
profound
melancholy
which
must
overcome
every
foreigner
in
a
country
whose
unsociable
inhabitants
appear
to
condemn
him
or
her
to
a
condition
of
utter
isolation
she
was
already
regretting
her
headstrong
caprice
but
to
go
back
at
once
would
have
been
to
risk
her
reputation
as
an
intrepid
traveller
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
be
patient
and
kill
time
as
best
she
could
with
this
noble
resolution
she
brought
out
her
crayons
and
colours
sketched
views
of
the
gulf
and
did
the
portrait
of
a
sunburnt
peasant
who
sold
melons
like
any
on
the
continent
but
who
wore
a
long
white
beard
and
looked
the
fiercest
rascal
that
had
ever
been
seen
as
all
that
was
not
enough
to
amuse
her
she
determined
to
turn
the
head
of
the
descendant
of
the
corporals
and
this
was
no
difficult
matter
since
far
from
being
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
his
village
orso
seemed
very
happy
at
ajaccio
although
he
knew
nobody
there
furthermore
miss
lydia
had
a
lofty
purpose
in
her
mind
it
was
nothing
less
than
to
civilize
this
mountain
bear
and
induce
him
to
relinquish
the
sinister
design
which
had
recalled
him
to
his
island
since
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
study
the
young
man
she
had
told
herself
it
would
be
a
pity
to
let
him
rush
upon
his
ruin
and
that
it
would
be
a
glorious
thing
to
convert
a
corsican
our
travellers
spent
the
day
in
the
following
manner
every
morning
the
colonel
and
orso
went
out
shooting
miss
lydia
sketched
or
wrote
letters
to
her
friends
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
dating
them
from
ajaccio
toward
six
o
clock
the
gentlemen
came
in
laden
with
game
then
followed
dinner
miss
lydia
sang
the
colonel
went
to
sleep
and
the
young
people
sat
talking
till
very
late
some
formality
or
other
connected
with
his
passports
had
made
it
necessary
for
colonel
nevil
to
call
on
the
prefect
this
gentleman
who
like
most
of
his
colleagues
found
his
life
very
dull
had
been
delighted
to
hear
of
the
arrival
of
an
englishman
who
was
rich
a
man
of
the
world
and
the
father
of
a
pretty
daughter
he
had
therefore
given
him
the
most
friendly
reception
and
overwhelmed
him
with
offers
of
service
further
within
a
very
few
days
he
came
to
return
his
visit
the
colonel
who
had
just
dined
was
comfortably
stretched
out
upon
his
sofa
and
very
nearly
asleep
his
daughter
was
singing
at
a
piano
orso
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
her
music
and
gazing
at
the
fair
singer
s
shoulders
and
golden
hair
the
prefect
was
announced
the
piano
stopped
the
colonel
got
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
introduced
the
prefect
to
his
daughter
i
do
not
introduce
della
rebbia
to
you
said
he
for
no
doubt
you
know
him
is
this
gentleman
colonel
della
rebbia
s
son
said
the
prefect
looking
a
trifle
embarrassed
yes
monsieur
replied
orso
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
your
the
ordinary
commonplaces
of
conversation
were
soon
exhausted
the
colonel
in
spite
of
himself
yawned
pretty
frequently
orso
as
a
liberal
did
not
care
to
converse
with
a
satellite
of
the
government
the
burden
of
the
conversation
fell
on
miss
lydia
the
prefect
on
his
side
did
not
let
it
drop
and
it
was
clear
that
he
found
the
greatest
pleasure
in
talking
of
paris
and
of
the
great
world
to
a
woman
who
was
acquainted
with
all
the
foremost
people
in
european
society
as
he
talked
he
now
and
then
glanced
at
orso
with
an
expression
of
singular
curiosity
was
it
on
the
continent
that
you
made
della
rebbia
s
acquaintance
he
inquired
somewhat
embarrassed
miss
lydia
replied
that
she
had
made
his
acquaintance
on
the
ship
which
had
carried
them
to
corsica
he
is
a
very
gentlemanly
young
fellow
said
the
prefect
in
an
undertone
and
has
he
told
you
he
added
dropping
his
voice
still
lower
why
he
has
returned
to
corsica
miss
lydia
put
on
her
most
majestic
air
and
answered
i
have
not
asked
him
she
said
you
may
do
the
prefect
kept
silence
but
an
instant
later
hearing
orso
speak
a
few
words
of
english
to
the
colonel
he
said
you
seem
to
have
travelled
a
great
deal
monsieur
you
must
have
forgotten
corsica
and
corsican
it
is
quite
true
that
i
was
very
young
when
i
went
you
still
belong
to
the
army
i
am
on
you
have
been
too
long
in
the
french
army
not
to
have
become
a
thorough
frenchman
i
have
no
doubt
the
last
words
of
the
sentence
were
spoken
with
marked
emphasis
the
corsicans
are
not
particularly
flattered
at
being
reminded
that
they
belong
to
the
great
they
claim
to
be
a
people
apart
and
so
well
do
they
justify
their
claim
that
it
may
very
well
be
granted
them
somewhat
nettled
orso
replied
do
you
think
le
prefet
that
a
corsican
must
necessarily
serve
in
the
french
army
to
become
an
honourable
man
no
indeed
said
the
prefect
that
is
not
my
idea
at
all
i
am
only
speaking
of
certain
belonging
to
this
country
some
of
which
are
not
such
as
a
government
official
would
like
to
he
emphasized
the
word
and
put
on
as
grave
an
expression
as
his
features
could
assume
soon
after
he
got
up
and
took
his
leave
bearing
with
him
miss
lydia
s
promise
that
she
would
go
and
call
on
his
wife
at
the
prefecture
when
he
had
departed
i
had
to
come
to
corsica
said
miss
lydia
to
find
out
what
a
prefect
is
like
this
one
strikes
me
as
rather
for
my
part
said
orso
i
can
t
say
as
much
he
strikes
me
as
a
very
queer
individual
with
his
airs
of
emphasis
and
the
colonel
was
extremely
drowsy
miss
lydia
cast
a
glance
in
his
direction
and
lowering
her
voice
and
i
she
said
do
not
think
him
so
mysterious
as
you
pretend
for
i
believe
i
understood
him
then
you
are
indeed
miss
nevil
if
you
have
seen
any
wit
in
what
he
has
just
said
you
must
certainly
have
put
it
there
it
is
the
marquis
de
mascarille
i
think
who
says
that
della
rebbia
but
would
you
like
me
to
give
you
a
proof
of
my
i
am
something
of
a
witch
and
i
can
read
the
thoughts
of
people
i
have
seen
only
good
heavens
you
alarm
me
if
you
really
can
read
my
thoughts
i
don
t
know
whether
i
should
be
glad
or
m
della
rebbia
went
on
miss
lydia
with
a
blush
we
have
only
known
each
other
for
a
few
days
but
at
sea
and
in
savage
countries
you
will
excuse
me
i
hope
in
savage
countries
friendships
grow
more
quickly
than
they
do
in
society
so
you
must
not
be
astonished
if
i
speak
to
you
as
a
friend
upon
private
matters
with
which
perhaps
a
stranger
ought
not
to
ah
do
not
say
that
word
miss
nevil
i
like
the
other
far
well
then
monsieur
i
must
tell
you
that
without
having
tried
to
find
out
your
secrets
i
have
learned
some
of
them
and
they
grieve
me
i
have
heard
monsieur
of
the
misfortune
which
has
overtaken
your
family
a
great
deal
has
been
said
to
me
about
the
vindictive
nature
of
your
and
the
fashion
in
which
they
take
their
vengeance
was
it
not
to
that
the
prefect
was
alluding
miss
lydia
can
you
believe
it
and
orso
turned
deadly
pale
no
della
rebbia
she
said
interrupting
him
i
know
you
to
be
a
most
honourable
gentleman
you
have
told
me
yourself
that
it
was
only
the
common
people
in
your
country
who
still
practised
the
which
you
are
pleased
to
describe
as
a
kind
of
do
you
then
believe
me
capable
of
ever
becoming
a
murderer
since
i
have
mentioned
the
subject
at
all
monsieur
orso
you
must
clearly
see
that
i
do
not
suspect
you
and
if
i
have
spoken
to
you
at
all
she
added
dropping
her
eyes
it
is
because
i
have
realized
that
surrounded
it
may
be
by
barbarous
prejudices
on
your
return
home
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
there
is
somebody
who
esteems
you
for
having
the
courage
to
resist
them
come
said
she
rising
to
her
feet
don
t
let
us
talk
again
of
such
horrid
things
they
make
my
head
ache
and
besides
it
s
very
late
you
are
not
angry
with
me
are
you
let
us
say
in
the
english
fashion
and
she
held
out
her
hand
orso
pressed
it
looking
grave
and
deeply
moved
mademoiselle
he
said
do
you
know
that
there
are
moments
when
the
instincts
of
my
country
wake
up
within
me
sometimes
when
i
think
of
my
poor
father
horrible
thoughts
assail
me
thanks
to
you
i
am
rid
of
them
forever
thank
you
thank
you
he
would
have
continued
but
miss
lydia
dropped
a
teaspoon
and
the
noise
woke
up
the
colonel
della
rebbia
we
ll
start
at
five
o
clock
morning
be
punctual
yes
chapter
v
the
next
day
a
short
time
before
the
sportsmen
came
back
miss
nevil
returning
with
her
maid
from
a
walk
along
the
seashore
was
just
about
to
enter
the
inn
when
she
noticed
a
young
woman
dressed
in
black
riding
into
the
town
on
a
small
but
strong
horse
she
was
followed
by
a
sort
of
peasant
also
on
horseback
who
wore
a
brown
cloth
jacket
cut
at
the
elbows
a
gourd
was
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
a
pistol
was
hanging
at
his
belt
his
hand
grasped
a
gun
the
butt
of
which
rested
in
a
leathern
pocket
fastened
to
his
in
short
he
wore
the
complete
costume
of
a
brigand
in
a
melodrama
or
of
the
corsican
on
his
travels
miss
nevil
s
attention
was
first
attracted
by
the
woman
s
remarkable
beauty
she
seemed
about
twenty
years
of
age
she
was
tall
and
pale
with
dark
blue
eyes
red
lips
and
teeth
like
enamel
in
her
expression
pride
anxiety
and
sadness
were
all
legible
on
her
head
she
wore
a
black
silk
veil
called
a
which
the
genoese
introduced
into
corsica
and
which
is
so
becoming
to
women
long
braids
of
chestnut
hair
formed
a
sort
of
turban
round
her
head
her
dress
was
neat
but
simple
in
the
extreme
miss
nevil
had
plenty
of
time
to
observe
her
for
the
lady
in
the
had
halted
in
the
street
and
was
questioning
somebody
on
a
subject
which
to
judge
from
the
expression
of
her
eyes
must
have
interested
her
exceedingly
then
as
soon
as
she
received
an
answer
she
touched
her
mount
with
her
and
breaking
into
a
quick
trot
never
halted
till
she
reached
the
door
of
the
hotel
in
which
sir
thomas
nevil
and
orso
were
staying
there
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
host
the
girl
sprang
nimbly
from
her
saddle
and
seated
herself
on
a
stone
bench
beside
the
entrance
door
while
her
groom
led
the
horses
away
to
the
stable
miss
lydia
in
her
paris
gown
passed
close
beside
the
stranger
who
did
not
raise
her
eyes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
opened
her
window
and
saw
the
lady
in
the
still
sitting
in
the
same
place
and
in
the
same
attitude
not
long
afterward
the
colonel
and
orso
returned
from
hunting
then
the
landlord
said
a
few
words
to
the
young
lady
in
mourning
and
pointed
to
della
rebbia
with
his
finger
she
coloured
deeply
rose
eagerly
went
a
few
paces
forward
and
then
stopped
short
apparently
much
confused
orso
was
quite
close
to
her
and
was
looking
at
her
curiously
are
you
orso
antonio
della
rebbia
said
she
in
a
tremulous
voice
i
am
colomba
cried
orso
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
he
kissed
her
tenderly
somewhat
to
the
surprise
of
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
but
in
england
people
do
not
kiss
each
other
in
the
street
brother
said
colomba
you
must
forgive
me
for
having
come
without
your
permission
but
i
heard
from
our
friends
that
you
had
arrived
and
it
is
such
a
great
consolation
to
me
to
see
again
orso
kissed
her
then
turning
to
the
colonel
this
is
my
sister
said
he
whom
i
never
should
have
recognised
if
she
had
not
told
me
her
name
colomba
colonel
sir
thomas
nevil
colonel
you
will
kindly
excuse
me
but
i
can
not
have
the
honour
of
dining
with
you
my
sister
but
my
dear
fellow
where
the
devil
do
you
expect
to
dine
you
know
very
well
there
is
only
one
dinner
in
this
infernal
tavern
and
we
have
bespoken
it
it
will
afford
my
daughter
great
pleasure
if
this
young
lady
will
join
colomba
looked
at
her
brother
who
did
not
need
much
pressing
and
they
all
passed
together
into
the
largest
room
in
the
inn
which
the
colonel
used
as
his
sitting
and
dining
room
mademoiselle
della
rebbia
on
being
introduced
to
miss
nevil
made
her
a
deep
courtesy
but
she
did
not
utter
a
single
word
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
very
much
frightened
at
finding
herself
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
in
the
company
of
strangers
belonging
to
the
great
world
yet
there
was
nothing
provincial
in
her
manners
the
novelty
of
her
position
excused
her
awkwardness
miss
nevil
took
a
liking
to
her
at
once
and
as
there
was
no
room
disengaged
in
the
hotel
the
whole
of
which
was
occupied
by
the
colonel
and
his
attendants
she
offered
either
out
of
condescension
or
curiosity
to
have
a
bed
prepared
in
her
own
room
for
mademoiselle
della
rebbia
colomba
stammered
a
few
words
of
thanks
and
hastened
after
miss
nevil
s
maid
to
make
such
changes
in
her
toilet
as
were
rendered
necessary
by
a
journey
on
horseback
in
the
dust
and
heat
when
she
the
she
paused
in
front
of
the
colonel
s
guns
which
the
hunters
had
left
in
a
corner
what
fine
weapons
said
she
are
they
yours
brother
no
they
are
the
colonel
s
english
guns
and
they
are
as
good
as
they
are
how
much
i
wish
you
had
one
like
them
said
colomba
one
of
those
three
certainly
does
belong
to
della
rebbia
exclaimed
the
colonel
he
really
shoots
almost
too
well
he
fired
fourteen
shots
and
brought
down
fourteen
head
of
a
friendly
dispute
at
once
ensued
in
which
orso
was
vanquished
to
his
sister
s
great
satisfaction
as
it
was
easy
to
perceive
from
the
childish
expression
of
delight
which
illumined
her
face
so
serious
a
moment
before
choose
my
dear
fellow
said
the
colonel
but
orso
refused
very
well
then
your
sister
shall
choose
for
colomba
did
not
wait
for
a
second
invitation
she
took
up
the
plainest
of
the
guns
but
it
was
a
manton
of
large
calibre
this
one
she
said
must
carry
a
ball
a
long
her
brother
was
growing
quite
confused
in
his
expressions
of
gratitude
when
dinner
appeared
very
opportunely
to
help
him
out
of
his
embarrassment
miss
lydia
was
delighted
to
notice
that
colomba
who
had
shown
considerable
reluctance
to
sit
down
with
them
and
had
yielded
only
at
a
glance
from
her
brother
crossed
herself
like
a
good
catholic
before
she
began
to
eat
good
said
she
to
herself
that
is
primitive
and
she
anticipated
acquiring
many
interesting
facts
by
observing
this
youthful
representative
of
ancient
corsican
manners
as
for
orso
he
was
evidently
a
trifle
uneasy
fearing
doubtless
that
his
sister
might
say
or
do
something
which
savoured
too
much
of
her
native
village
but
colomba
watched
him
constantly
and
regulated
all
her
own
movements
by
his
sometimes
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
with
a
strange
expression
of
sadness
and
then
if
orso
s
eyes
met
hers
he
was
the
first
to
turn
them
away
as
though
he
would
evade
some
question
which
his
sister
was
mentally
addressing
to
him
the
sense
of
which
he
understood
only
too
well
everybody
talked
french
for
the
colonel
could
only
express
himself
very
badly
in
italian
colomba
understood
french
and
even
pronounced
the
few
words
she
was
obliged
to
exchange
with
her
entertainers
tolerably
well
after
dinner
the
colonel
who
had
noticed
the
sort
of
constraint
which
existed
between
the
brother
and
sister
inquired
of
orso
with
his
customary
frankness
whether
he
did
not
wish
to
be
alone
with
mademoiselle
colomba
offering
in
that
case
to
go
into
the
next
room
with
his
daughter
but
orso
hastened
to
thank
him
and
to
assure
him
they
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
talk
at
pietranera
this
was
the
name
of
the
village
where
he
was
to
take
up
his
abode
the
colonel
then
resumed
his
customary
position
on
the
sofa
and
miss
nevil
after
attempting
several
subjects
of
conversation
gave
up
all
hope
of
inducing
the
fair
colomba
to
talk
and
begged
orso
to
read
her
a
canto
out
of
dante
her
favourite
poet
orso
chose
the
canto
of
the
inferno
containing
the
episode
of
francesca
da
rimini
and
began
to
read
as
impressively
as
he
was
able
the
glorious
tiercets
which
so
admirably
express
the
risk
run
by
two
young
persons
who
venture
to
read
a
together
as
he
read
on
colomba
drew
nearer
to
the
table
and
raised
her
head
which
she
had
kept
lowered
her
eyes
shone
with
extraordinary
fire
she
grew
red
and
pale
by
turns
and
stirred
convulsively
in
her
chair
how
admirable
is
the
italian
organization
which
can
understand
poetry
without
needing
a
pedant
to
explain
its
beauties
when
the
canto
was
finished
how
beautiful
that
is
she
exclaimed
who
wrote
it
brother
orso
was
a
little
disconcerted
and
miss
lydia
answered
with
a
smile
that
it
was
written
by
a
florentine
poet
who
had
been
dead
for
centuries
you
shall
read
dante
said
orso
when
you
are
at
good
heavens
how
beautiful
it
is
said
colomba
again
and
she
repeated
three
or
four
tiercets
which
she
had
remembered
speaking
at
first
in
an
undertone
then
growing
excited
she
declaimed
them
aloud
with
far
more
expression
than
her
brother
had
put
into
his
reading
miss
lydia
was
very
much
astonished
you
seem
very
fond
of
poetry
she
said
how
i
envy
you
the
delight
you
will
find
in
reading
dante
for
the
first
time
you
see
miss
nevil
said
orso
what
a
power
dante
s
lines
must
have
when
they
so
move
a
wild
young
savage
who
knows
nothing
but
her
but
i
am
mistaken
i
recollect
now
that
colomba
belongs
to
the
guild
even
when
she
was
quite
a
little
child
she
used
to
try
her
hand
at
and
my
father
used
to
write
me
word
that
she
was
the
best
in
pietranera
and
for
two
leagues
round
colomba
cast
an
imploring
glance
at
her
brother
miss
nevil
had
heard
of
the
corsican
and
was
dying
to
hear
one
she
begged
colomba
then
to
give
her
a
specimen
of
her
powers
very
much
vexed
now
at
having
made
any
mention
of
his
sister
s
poetic
gifts
orso
interposed
in
vain
did
he
protest
that
nothing
was
so
insipid
as
a
corsican
and
that
to
recite
the
corsican
verses
after
those
of
dante
was
like
betraying
his
country
all
he
did
was
to
stimulate
miss
nevil
s
curiosity
and
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
say
to
his
sister
well
well
improvise
something
but
let
it
be
short
colomba
heaved
a
sigh
looked
fixedly
for
a
moment
first
at
the
and
then
at
the
rafters
of
the
ceiling
at
last
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand
like
those
birds
that
gather
courage
and
fancy
they
are
not
seen
when
they
no
longer
see
themselves
she
sang
or
rather
declaimed
in
an
unsteady
voice
the
following
the
maiden
and
the
in
the
valley
far
away
among
the
mountains
the
sun
only
shines
for
an
hour
every
day
in
the
valley
there
stands
a
gloomy
house
and
grass
grows
on
its
threshold
doors
and
windows
are
always
shut
no
smoke
rises
from
the
roof
but
at
noon
when
the
sunshine
falls
a
window
opens
and
the
orphan
girl
sits
spinning
at
her
wheel
she
spins
and
as
she
works
she
sings
a
song
of
sadness
but
no
other
song
comes
to
answer
hers
one
day
a
day
in
a
settled
on
a
tree
hard
by
and
heard
the
maiden
s
song
maiden
it
said
thou
art
not
the
only
mourner
a
cruel
hawk
has
snatched
my
mate
from
me
show
me
that
cruel
hawk
were
it
to
soar
higher
than
the
clouds
i
would
soon
bring
it
down
to
earth
but
who
will
restore
to
me
unhappy
that
i
am
my
brother
now
in
a
far
country
maiden
tell
me
where
thy
brother
is
and
my
wings
shall
bear
me
to
a
indeed
exclaimed
orso
and
the
emotion
with
which
he
kissed
his
sister
contrasted
strongly
with
the
jesting
tone
in
which
he
spoke
your
song
is
delightful
said
miss
lydia
you
must
write
it
in
my
album
i
ll
translate
it
into
english
and
have
it
set
to
the
worthy
colonel
who
had
not
understood
a
single
word
added
his
compliments
to
his
daughter
s
and
added
is
this
dove
you
speak
of
the
bird
we
ate
broiled
at
dinner
miss
nevil
fetched
her
album
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
the
write
down
her
song
with
so
much
care
in
the
matter
of
economizing
space
the
lines
instead
of
being
separate
were
all
run
together
as
far
as
the
breadth
of
the
paper
would
permit
so
that
they
did
not
agree
with
the
accepted
definition
of
poetic
composition
short
lines
of
unequal
length
with
a
margin
on
each
side
of
mademoiselle
colomba
s
somewhat
fanciful
spelling
might
also
have
excited
comment
more
than
once
miss
nevil
was
seen
to
smile
and
orso
s
fraternal
vanity
suffered
tortures
bedtime
came
and
the
two
young
girls
retired
to
their
room
there
while
miss
lydia
unclasped
her
necklace
and
bracelets
she
watched
her
companion
draw
something
out
of
her
gown
something
as
long
as
a
but
very
different
in
shape
carefully
almost
stealthily
colomba
slipped
this
object
under
her
which
she
laid
on
the
table
then
she
knelt
down
and
said
her
prayers
devoutly
two
minutes
afterward
she
was
in
her
bed
miss
lydia
naturally
very
inquisitive
and
as
slow
as
every
englishwoman
is
about
undressing
herself
moved
over
to
the
table
pretended
she
was
looking
for
a
pin
lifted
up
the
and
saw
a
long
stiletto
curiously
mounted
in
silver
and
the
workmanship
was
remarkably
fine
it
was
an
ancient
weapon
and
just
the
sort
of
one
an
amateur
would
have
prized
very
highly
is
it
the
custom
here
inquired
miss
nevil
with
a
smile
for
young
ladies
to
wear
such
little
instruments
as
these
in
their
bodices
it
is
answered
colomba
with
a
sigh
there
are
so
many
wicked
people
about
and
would
you
really
have
the
courage
to
strike
with
it
like
this
and
miss
nevil
dagger
in
hand
made
a
gesture
of
stabbing
from
above
as
actors
do
on
the
stage
yes
said
colomba
in
her
soft
musical
voice
if
i
had
to
do
it
to
protect
myself
or
my
friends
but
you
must
not
hold
it
like
that
you
might
wound
yourself
if
the
person
you
were
going
to
stab
were
to
draw
then
sitting
up
in
bed
see
she
added
you
must
strike
like
this
upward
if
you
do
so
the
thrust
is
sure
to
kill
they
say
happy
are
they
who
never
need
such
she
sighed
dropped
her
head
back
on
the
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
a
more
noble
beautiful
virginal
head
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
phidias
would
have
asked
no
other
model
for
minerva
chapter
vi
it
is
in
obedience
to
the
precept
of
horace
that
i
have
begun
by
plunging
media
now
that
every
one
is
asleep
the
beautiful
colomba
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
i
will
seize
the
opportunity
to
acquaint
my
reader
with
certain
details
of
which
he
must
not
be
ignorant
if
he
desires
to
follow
the
further
course
of
this
veracious
history
he
is
already
aware
that
colonel
della
rebbia
orso
s
father
had
been
assassinated
now
in
corsica
people
are
not
murdered
as
they
are
in
france
by
the
first
escaped
convict
who
can
devise
no
better
means
of
relieving
a
man
of
his
in
corsica
a
man
is
murdered
by
his
enemies
but
the
reason
he
has
enemies
is
often
very
difficult
to
discover
many
families
hate
each
other
because
it
has
been
an
habit
of
theirs
to
hate
each
other
but
the
tradition
of
the
original
cause
of
their
hatred
may
have
completely
disappeared
the
family
to
which
colonel
della
rebbia
belonged
hated
several
other
families
but
that
of
the
barricini
particularly
some
people
asserted
that
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
della
rebbia
had
seduced
a
lady
of
the
barricini
family
and
had
afterward
been
poniarded
by
a
relative
of
the
outraged
damsel
others
indeed
told
the
story
in
a
different
fashion
declaring
that
it
was
a
della
rebbia
who
had
been
seduced
and
a
barricini
who
had
been
poniarded
however
that
may
be
there
was
to
use
the
expression
blood
between
the
two
nevertheless
and
contrary
to
custom
this
murder
had
not
resulted
in
others
for
the
della
rebbia
and
the
barricini
had
been
equally
persecuted
by
the
genoese
government
and
as
the
young
men
had
all
left
the
country
the
two
families
were
deprived
during
several
generations
of
their
more
energetic
representatives
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
one
of
the
della
rebbias
an
officer
in
the
neapolitan
service
quarrelled
in
a
gambling
hell
with
some
soldiers
who
called
him
a
corsican
goatherd
and
other
insulting
names
he
drew
his
sword
but
being
only
one
against
three
he
would
have
fared
very
ill
if
a
stranger
who
was
playing
in
the
same
room
had
not
exclaimed
i
too
am
a
corsican
and
come
to
his
rescue
this
stranger
was
one
of
the
barricini
who
for
that
matter
was
not
acquainted
with
his
countryman
after
mutual
explanations
they
interchanged
courtesies
and
vowed
eternal
friendship
for
on
the
continent
quite
contrary
to
their
practice
in
their
own
island
corsicans
quickly
become
friends
this
fact
was
clearly
exemplified
on
the
present
occasion
as
long
as
della
rebbia
and
barricini
remained
in
italy
they
were
close
friends
once
they
were
back
in
corsica
they
saw
each
other
but
very
seldom
although
they
both
lived
in
the
same
village
and
when
they
died
it
was
reported
that
they
had
not
spoken
to
each
other
for
five
or
six
years
their
sons
lived
in
the
same
fashion
on
ceremony
as
they
say
in
the
island
one
of
them
ghilfuccio
orso
s
father
was
a
soldier
the
other
giudice
barricini
was
a
lawyer
having
both
become
heads
of
families
and
being
separated
by
their
professions
they
scarcely
ever
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
or
hearing
of
each
other
one
day
however
about
the
year
giudice
read
in
a
newspaper
at
bastia
that
captain
ghilfuccio
had
just
been
decorated
and
remarked
before
witnesses
that
he
was
not
at
all
surprised
considering
that
the
family
enjoyed
the
protection
of
general
this
remark
was
reported
at
vienna
to
ghilfuccio
who
told
one
of
his
countrymen
that
when
he
got
back
to
corsica
he
would
find
giudice
a
very
rich
man
because
he
made
more
money
out
of
the
suits
he
lost
than
out
of
those
he
won
it
was
never
known
whether
he
meant
this
as
an
insinuation
that
the
lawyer
cheated
his
clients
or
as
a
mere
allusion
to
the
commonplace
truth
that
a
bad
cause
often
brings
a
lawyer
more
profit
than
a
good
one
however
that
may
have
been
the
lawyer
barricini
heard
of
the
epigram
and
never
forgot
it
in
he
applied
for
the
post
of
mayor
of
his
commune
and
had
every
hope
of
being
appointed
when
general
wrote
to
the
prefect
to
recommend
one
of
ghilfuccio
s
wife
s
relations
the
prefect
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
the
general
s
wish
and
barricini
felt
no
doubt
that
he
owed
his
failure
to
the
intrigues
of
ghilfuccio
in
after
the
emperor
s
fall
the
general
s
protégé
was
denounced
as
a
bonapartist
and
his
place
was
taken
by
barricini
he
in
his
turn
was
dismissed
during
the
hundred
days
but
when
the
storm
had
blown
over
he
again
took
possession
with
great
pomp
of
the
mayoral
seal
and
the
municipal
registers
from
this
moment
his
star
shone
brighter
than
ever
colonel
della
rebbia
now
living
on
at
pietranera
had
to
defend
himself
against
covert
and
repeated
attacks
due
to
the
pettifogging
malignity
of
his
enemy
at
one
time
he
was
summoned
to
pay
for
the
damage
his
horse
had
done
to
the
mayor
s
fences
at
another
the
latter
under
pretence
of
repairing
the
floor
of
the
church
ordered
the
removal
of
a
broken
flagstone
bearing
the
della
rebbia
arms
which
covered
the
grave
of
some
member
of
the
family
if
the
village
goats
ate
the
colonel
s
young
plants
the
mayor
always
protected
their
owners
the
grocer
who
kept
the
at
pietranera
and
the
old
maimed
soldier
who
had
been
the
village
policeman
both
of
them
attached
to
the
della
rebbia
family
were
turned
adrift
and
their
places
filled
by
barricini
s
creatures
the
colonel
s
wife
died
and
her
last
wish
was
that
she
might
be
buried
in
the
middle
of
the
little
wood
in
which
she
had
been
fond
of
walking
forthwith
the
mayor
declared
she
should
be
buried
in
the
village
cemetery
because
he
had
no
authority
to
permit
burial
in
any
other
spot
the
colonel
in
a
fury
declared
that
until
the
permit
came
his
wife
would
be
interred
in
the
spot
she
had
chosen
he
had
her
grave
dug
there
the
mayor
on
his
side
had
another
grave
dug
in
the
cemetery
and
sent
for
the
police
that
the
law
so
he
declared
might
be
duly
enforced
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
two
parties
came
face
to
face
and
for
a
moment
there
was
reason
to
fear
a
struggle
might
ensue
for
the
possession
of
signora
della
rebbia
s
corpse
some
forty
peasants
mustered
by
the
dead
woman
s
relatives
forced
the
priest
when
he
issued
from
the
church
to
take
the
road
to
the
wood
on
the
other
hand
the
mayor
at
the
head
of
his
two
sons
his
dependents
and
the
gendarmes
advanced
to
oppose
their
march
when
he
appeared
and
called
on
the
procession
to
turn
back
he
was
greeted
with
howls
and
threats
the
advantage
of
numbers
was
with
his
opponents
and
they
seemed
thoroughly
determined
at
sight
of
him
several
guns
were
loaded
and
one
shepherd
is
even
said
to
have
levelled
his
musket
at
him
but
the
colonel
knocked
up
the
barrel
and
said
let
no
man
fire
without
my
orders
the
mayor
who
like
panurge
had
a
natural
fear
of
blows
refused
to
give
battle
and
retired
with
his
escort
then
the
funeral
procession
started
carefully
choosing
the
longest
way
so
as
to
pass
in
front
of
the
mayor
s
house
as
it
was
filing
by
an
idiot
who
had
joined
its
ranks
took
it
into
his
head
to
shout
vive
l
empereur
two
or
three
voices
answered
him
and
the
rebbianites
growing
hotter
proposed
killing
one
of
the
mayor
s
oxen
which
chanced
to
bar
their
way
fortunately
the
colonel
stopped
this
act
of
violence
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
mention
that
an
official
statement
was
at
once
drawn
up
or
that
the
mayor
sent
the
prefect
a
report
in
his
sublimest
style
describing
the
manner
in
which
all
laws
human
and
divine
had
been
trodden
under
foot
how
the
majesty
of
himself
the
mayor
and
of
the
priest
had
been
flouted
and
insulted
and
how
colonel
della
rebbia
had
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
bonapartist
plot
to
change
the
order
of
succession
to
the
throne
and
to
excite
peaceful
citizens
to
take
arms
against
one
another
crimes
provided
against
by
articles
and
of
the
penal
code
the
exaggerated
tone
of
this
complaint
diminished
its
effect
the
colonel
wrote
to
the
prefect
and
to
the
public
prosecutor
one
of
his
wife
s
kinsmen
was
related
to
one
of
the
deputies
of
the
island
another
was
cousin
to
the
president
of
the
royal
court
thanks
to
this
interest
the
plot
faded
out
of
sight
signora
della
rebbia
was
left
quiet
in
the
wood
and
the
idiot
alone
was
sentenced
to
a
fortnight
s
imprisonment
lawyer
barricini
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
this
affair
turned
his
batteries
in
a
different
direction
he
dug
out
some
old
claim
whereby
he
undertook
to
contest
the
colonel
s
ownership
of
a
certain
which
turned
a
a
lawsuit
began
and
dragged
slowly
along
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
the
court
was
about
to
give
its
decision
and
according
to
all
appearances
in
favour
of
the
colonel
when
barricini
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
public
prosecutor
a
letter
signed
by
a
certain
agostini
a
bandit
threatening
him
the
mayor
with
fire
and
sword
if
he
did
not
relinquish
his
pretensions
it
is
well
known
that
in
corsica
the
protection
of
these
brigands
is
much
sought
after
and
that
to
oblige
their
friends
they
frequently
intervene
in
private
quarrels
the
mayor
was
deriving
considerable
advantage
from
this
letter
when
the
business
was
further
complicated
by
a
fresh
incident
agostini
the
bandit
wrote
to
the
public
prosecutor
to
complain
that
his
handwriting
had
been
counterfeited
and
his
character
aspersed
by
some
one
who
desired
to
represent
him
as
a
man
who
made
a
traffic
of
his
influence
if
i
can
discover
the
forger
he
said
at
the
end
of
his
letter
i
will
make
a
striking
example
of
it
was
quite
clear
that
agostini
did
not
write
the
threatening
letter
to
the
mayor
the
della
rebbia
accused
the
barricini
of
it
and
both
parties
broke
into
open
threats
and
the
authorities
did
not
know
where
to
find
the
culprit
in
the
midst
of
all
this
colonel
ghilfuccio
was
murdered
here
are
the
facts
as
they
were
elicited
at
the
official
inquiry
on
the
of
august
toward
nightfall
a
woman
named
maddalena
pietri
who
was
carrying
corn
to
pietranera
heard
two
shots
fired
very
close
together
the
reports
as
it
seemed
to
her
coming
from
the
deep
lane
leading
to
the
village
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
from
the
spot
on
which
she
stood
almost
immediately
afterward
she
saw
a
man
running
crouching
along
a
footpath
among
the
vines
and
making
for
the
village
the
man
stopped
for
a
minute
and
turned
round
but
the
distance
prevented
the
woman
pietri
from
seeing
his
features
and
besides
he
had
a
in
his
mouth
which
hid
almost
the
whole
of
his
face
he
made
a
signal
with
his
head
to
some
comrade
whom
the
witness
could
not
see
and
then
disappeared
among
the
vines
the
woman
pietri
dropped
her
burden
ran
up
the
path
and
found
colonel
della
rebbia
bathed
in
his
own
blood
from
two
bullet
wounds
but
still
breathing
close
beside
him
lay
his
gun
loaded
and
cocked
as
if
he
had
been
defending
himself
against
a
person
who
had
attacked
him
in
front
just
when
another
had
struck
him
from
behind
although
the
rattle
was
in
his
throat
he
struggled
against
the
grip
of
death
but
he
could
not
utter
a
word
this
the
doctors
explained
by
the
nature
of
the
wounds
which
had
cut
through
his
lungs
the
blood
was
choking
him
it
flowed
slowly
like
red
froth
in
vain
did
the
woman
lift
him
up
and
ask
him
several
questions
she
saw
plainly
enough
that
he
desired
to
speak
but
he
could
not
make
himself
understood
noticing
that
he
was
trying
to
get
his
hand
to
his
pocket
she
quickly
drew
out
of
it
a
little
which
she
opened
and
gave
to
him
the
wounded
man
took
the
pencil
out
of
the
and
tried
to
write
in
fact
the
witness
saw
him
form
several
letters
but
with
great
difficulty
as
she
could
not
read
however
she
was
unable
to
understand
their
meaning
exhausted
by
the
effort
the
colonel
left
the
in
the
woman
s
hand
which
he
squeezed
tightly
looking
at
her
strangely
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
these
are
the
witness
s
own
words
it
is
important
it
is
my
murderer
s
name
maddalena
pietri
was
going
up
to
the
village
when
she
met
barricini
the
mayor
with
his
son
vincentello
it
was
then
almost
dark
she
told
them
what
she
had
seen
the
mayor
took
the
hurried
up
to
his
house
put
on
his
sash
and
fetched
his
secretary
and
the
gendarmes
left
alone
with
young
vincentello
maddalena
pietri
suggested
that
he
should
go
to
the
colonel
s
assistance
in
case
he
was
still
alive
but
vincentello
replied
that
if
he
were
to
go
near
a
man
who
had
been
the
bitter
enemy
of
his
family
he
would
certainly
be
accused
of
having
killed
him
a
very
short
time
afterward
the
mayor
arrived
found
the
colonel
dead
had
the
corpse
carried
away
and
drew
up
his
report
in
spite
of
the
agitation
so
natural
on
such
an
occasion
monsieur
barricini
had
hastened
to
place
the
colonel
s
under
seal
and
to
make
all
the
inquiries
in
his
power
but
none
of
them
resulted
in
any
discovery
of
importance
when
the
examining
magistrate
arrived
the
was
opened
and
on
a
page
were
seen
letters
written
in
a
trembling
hand
but
still
quite
legible
the
sheet
bore
the
word
and
the
judge
did
not
doubt
that
the
colonel
had
intended
to
point
out
agostini
as
his
murderer
nevertheless
colomba
della
rebbia
who
had
been
summoned
by
the
magistrate
asked
leave
to
examine
the
after
turning
the
leaves
for
a
few
moments
she
stretched
out
her
hand
toward
the
mayor
and
cried
there
stands
the
murderer
then
with
a
precision
and
a
clearness
which
were
astonishing
considering
the
passion
of
sorrow
that
shook
her
she
related
that
a
few
days
previously
her
father
had
received
a
letter
from
his
son
which
he
had
burned
but
that
before
doing
so
he
had
written
orso
s
address
he
had
just
changed
his
garrison
in
the
with
his
pencil
now
his
address
was
no
longer
in
the
and
colomba
concluded
that
the
mayor
had
torn
out
the
leaf
on
which
it
was
written
which
probably
was
that
on
which
her
father
had
traced
the
murderer
s
name
and
for
that
name
the
mayor
according
to
colomba
had
substituted
agostini
s
the
magistrate
in
fact
noticed
that
one
sheet
was
missing
from
the
quire
on
which
the
name
was
written
but
he
remarked
also
that
leaves
were
likewise
missing
from
other
quires
in
the
same
and
certain
witnesses
testified
that
the
colonel
had
a
habit
of
tearing
out
pages
when
he
wanted
to
light
a
cigar
therefore
nothing
was
more
probable
than
that
by
an
oversight
he
had
burned
the
address
he
had
copied
further
it
was
shown
that
the
mayor
could
not
have
read
the
on
receiving
it
from
maddalena
pietri
on
account
of
the
darkness
and
it
was
proved
that
he
had
not
stopped
an
instant
before
he
went
into
his
house
that
the
sergeant
of
the
gendarmes
had
gone
there
with
him
and
had
seen
him
light
a
lamp
and
put
the
into
an
envelope
which
he
had
sealed
before
his
eyes
when
this
officer
had
concluded
his
deposition
colomba
cast
herself
at
his
feet
and
besought
him
by
all
he
held
most
sacred
to
say
whether
he
had
not
left
the
mayor
alone
for
a
single
moment
after
a
certain
amount
of
hesitation
the
man
who
was
evidently
affected
by
the
young
girl
s
excitement
admitted
that
he
had
gone
into
the
next
room
to
fetch
a
sheet
of
foolscap
but
that
he
had
not
been
away
a
minute
and
that
the
mayor
had
talked
to
him
all
the
time
he
was
groping
for
the
paper
in
a
drawer
moreover
he
deposed
that
when
he
came
back
the
was
still
on
the
table
in
the
very
place
where
the
mayor
had
thrown
it
when
he
first
came
in
monsieur
barricini
gave
his
evidence
with
the
utmost
coolness
he
made
allowances
he
said
for
mademoiselle
della
rebbia
s
excitement
and
was
ready
to
condescend
to
justify
himself
he
proved
that
he
had
spent
his
whole
evening
in
the
village
that
his
son
vincentello
had
been
with
him
in
front
of
the
house
at
the
moment
when
the
crime
was
committed
and
that
his
son
orlanduccio
who
had
had
an
attack
of
fever
that
very
day
had
never
left
his
bed
he
produced
every
gun
in
his
house
and
not
one
of
them
had
been
recently
discharged
he
added
that
as
regarded
the
he
had
at
once
realized
its
importance
that
he
had
sealed
it
up
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
his
deputy
foreseeing
that
he
himself
might
be
suspected
on
account
of
his
quarrel
with
the
colonel
finally
he
reminded
the
court
that
agostini
had
threatened
to
kill
the
man
who
had
written
a
letter
in
his
name
and
he
insinuated
that
this
ruffian
had
probably
suspected
the
colonel
and
murdered
him
such
a
vengeance
for
a
similar
reason
is
by
no
means
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
brigandage
five
days
after
colonel
della
rebbia
s
death
agostini
was
surprised
by
a
detachment
of
riflemen
and
killed
fighting
desperately
to
the
last
on
his
person
was
found
a
letter
from
colomba
beseeching
him
to
declare
whether
he
was
guilty
of
the
murder
imputed
to
him
or
not
as
the
bandit
had
sent
no
answer
it
was
pretty
generally
concluded
that
he
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
a
daughter
he
had
murdered
her
father
yet
those
who
claimed
to
know
agostini
s
nature
thoroughly
whispered
that
if
he
had
killed
the
colonel
he
would
have
boasted
of
the
deed
another
bandit
known
by
the
name
of
brandolaccio
sent
colomba
a
declaration
in
which
he
bore
witness
on
his
honour
to
his
comrade
s
innocence
but
the
only
proof
he
put
forward
was
that
agostini
had
never
told
him
that
he
suspected
the
colonel
the
upshot
was
that
the
barricini
suffered
no
inconvenience
the
examining
magistrate
was
loud
in
his
praise
of
the
mayor
and
the
mayor
on
his
side
crowned
his
handsome
behaviour
by
relinquishing
all
his
claims
over
the
stream
concerning
which
he
had
brought
the
lawsuit
against
colonel
della
rebbia
according
to
the
custom
of
her
country
colomba
improvised
a
in
presence
of
her
father
s
corpse
and
before
his
assembled
friends
in
it
she
poured
out
all
her
hatred
against
the
barricini
formally
charged
them
with
the
murder
and
threatened
them
with
her
brother
s
vengeance
it
was
this
same
which
had
grown
very
popular
that
the
sailor
had
sung
before
miss
lydia
when
orso
who
was
in
the
north
of
france
heard
of
his
father
s
death
he
applied
for
leave
but
failed
to
obtain
it
a
letter
from
his
sister
led
him
to
believe
at
first
in
the
guilt
of
the
barricini
but
he
soon
received
copies
of
all
the
documents
connected
with
the
inquiry
and
a
private
letter
from
the
judge
which
almost
convinced
him
that
the
bandit
agostini
was
the
only
culprit
every
three
months
colomba
had
written
to
him
reiterating
her
suspicions
which
she
called
her
in
spite
of
himself
these
accusations
made
his
corsican
blood
boil
and
sometimes
he
was
very
near
sharing
his
sister
s
prejudices
nevertheless
every
time
he
wrote
to
her
he
repeated
his
conviction
that
her
allegations
possessed
no
solid
foundation
and
were
quite
unworthy
of
belief
he
even
forbade
her
but
always
vainly
to
mention
them
to
him
again
thus
two
years
went
by
at
the
end
of
that
time
orso
was
placed
on
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
go
back
to
his
own
country
not
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
taking
vengeance
on
people
whom
he
believed
innocent
but
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
his
sister
and
the
sale
of
his
own
small
property
if
its
value
should
prove
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
live
on
the
continent
chapter
vii
whether
it
was
that
the
arrival
of
his
sister
had
reminded
orso
forcibly
of
his
paternal
home
or
that
colomba
s
unconventional
dress
and
manners
made
him
feel
shy
before
his
civilized
friends
he
announced
the
very
next
day
his
determination
to
leave
ajaccio
and
to
return
to
pietranera
but
he
made
the
colonel
promise
that
when
he
went
to
bastia
he
would
come
and
stay
in
his
modest
and
undertook
in
return
to
provide
him
with
plenty
of
buck
pheasant
boar
and
other
game
on
the
day
before
that
of
his
departure
orso
proposed
that
instead
of
going
out
shooting
they
should
all
take
a
walk
along
the
shores
of
the
gulf
with
miss
lydia
on
his
arm
he
was
able
to
talk
in
perfect
freedom
for
colomba
had
stayed
in
the
town
to
do
her
shopping
and
the
colonel
was
perpetually
leaving
the
young
people
to
fire
shots
at
and
gannets
greatly
to
the
astonishment
of
the
who
could
not
conceive
why
any
man
should
waste
his
powder
on
such
paltry
game
they
were
walking
along
the
path
leading
to
the
greek
chapel
which
commands
the
finest
view
to
be
had
of
the
bay
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
miss
lydia
said
orso
after
a
silence
which
had
lasted
long
enough
to
become
embarrassing
tell
me
frankly
what
do
you
think
of
my
sister
i
like
her
very
much
answered
miss
nevil
better
than
you
she
added
with
a
smile
for
she
is
a
true
corsican
and
you
are
rather
too
civilized
a
savage
too
civilized
well
in
spite
of
myself
i
feel
that
i
am
growing
a
savage
again
since
i
have
set
my
foot
on
the
island
a
thousand
horrid
thoughts
disturb
and
torment
me
and
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
a
little
before
i
plunge
into
my
desert
you
must
be
brave
monsieur
look
at
your
sister
s
resignation
she
sets
you
an
example
ah
do
not
be
deceived
do
not
believe
in
her
resignation
she
has
not
said
a
word
to
me
as
yet
but
every
look
of
hers
tells
me
what
she
expects
of
what
does
she
expect
of
you
then
oh
nothing
except
that
i
should
try
whether
your
father
s
gun
will
kill
a
man
as
surely
as
it
kills
a
what
an
idea
you
can
actually
believe
that
when
you
have
just
acknowledged
that
she
has
said
nothing
to
you
yet
it
really
is
too
dreadful
of
you
if
her
thoughts
were
not
fixed
on
vengeance
she
would
have
spoken
to
me
at
once
about
our
father
she
has
never
done
it
she
would
have
mentioned
the
names
of
those
she
considers
wrongly
i
know
to
be
his
murderers
but
no
not
a
word
that
is
because
we
corsicans
you
see
are
a
cunning
race
my
sister
realizes
that
she
does
not
hold
me
completely
in
her
power
and
she
does
not
choose
to
startle
me
while
i
may
still
escape
her
once
she
has
led
me
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
once
i
turn
giddy
there
she
will
thrust
me
into
the
then
orso
gave
miss
nevil
some
details
of
his
father
s
death
and
recounted
the
principal
proofs
which
had
culminated
in
his
belief
that
agostini
was
the
assassin
nothing
he
added
has
been
able
to
convince
colomba
i
saw
that
by
her
last
letter
she
has
sworn
the
barricini
shall
die
and
you
see
miss
nevil
what
confidence
i
have
in
you
they
would
not
be
alive
now
perhaps
if
one
of
the
prejudices
for
which
her
uncivilized
education
must
be
the
excuse
had
not
convinced
her
that
the
execution
of
this
vengeance
belongs
to
me
as
head
of
her
family
and
that
my
honour
depends
upon
it
really
and
truly
monsieur
della
rebbia
said
miss
nevil
you
slander
your
sister
no
as
you
have
said
it
yourself
she
is
a
corsican
she
thinks
as
they
all
think
do
you
know
why
i
was
so
sad
yesterday
no
but
for
some
time
past
you
have
been
subject
to
these
fits
of
sadness
you
were
much
pleasanter
in
the
earlier
days
of
our
yesterday
on
the
contrary
i
was
more
cheery
and
happy
than
i
generally
am
i
had
seen
how
kind
how
indulgent
you
were
to
my
sister
the
colonel
and
i
were
coming
home
in
a
boat
do
you
know
what
one
of
the
boatmen
said
to
me
in
his
infernal
you
ve
killed
a
deal
of
game
ors
anton
but
you
ll
find
orlanduccio
barricini
a
better
shot
than
you
well
what
was
there
so
very
dreadful
in
that
remark
are
you
so
very
much
set
upon
being
considered
a
skilful
sportsman
but
don
t
you
see
the
ruffian
was
telling
me
i
shouldn
t
have
courage
to
kill
orlanduccio
do
you
know
della
rebbia
you
frighten
me
the
air
of
this
island
of
yours
seems
not
only
to
give
people
fevers
but
to
drive
them
mad
luckily
we
shall
be
leaving
it
soon
not
without
coming
to
pietranera
you
have
promised
my
sister
and
if
we
were
to
fail
in
that
promise
we
should
bring
down
some
terrible
vengeance
on
our
heads
no
doubt
do
you
remember
that
story
your
father
was
telling
us
the
other
day
about
the
indians
who
threatened
the
company
s
agents
that
if
they
would
not
grant
their
prayer
they
would
starve
themselves
to
death
that
means
that
you
would
starve
yourself
to
death
i
doubt
it
very
much
you
would
go
hungry
for
one
day
and
then
mademoiselle
colomba
would
bring
you
such
a
tempting
that
you
would
quite
relinquish
your
a
sort
of
baked
cream
cheese
a
national
dish
in
corsica
your
jests
are
cruel
miss
nevil
you
might
spare
me
listen
i
am
alone
here
i
have
no
one
but
you
to
prevent
me
from
going
mad
as
you
call
it
you
have
been
my
guardian
angel
and
now
now
said
miss
lydia
gravely
to
steady
this
reason
of
yours
which
is
so
easily
shaken
you
have
the
honour
of
a
soldier
and
a
man
and
she
added
turning
away
to
pluck
a
flower
if
that
will
be
any
help
to
you
you
have
the
memory
of
your
guardian
angel
too
ah
miss
nevil
if
i
could
only
think
you
really
take
some
interest
listen
della
rebbia
said
miss
nevil
with
some
emotion
as
you
are
a
child
i
will
treat
you
as
i
would
treat
a
child
when
i
was
a
little
girl
my
mother
gave
me
a
beautiful
necklace
which
i
had
longed
for
greatly
but
she
said
to
me
every
time
you
put
on
this
necklace
remember
you
do
not
know
french
the
necklace
lost
some
of
its
value
in
my
eyes
it
was
a
source
of
constant
but
i
wore
it
and
in
the
end
i
knew
french
do
you
see
this
ring
it
is
an
egyptian
scarabaeus
found
if
you
please
in
a
pyramid
that
strange
figure
which
you
may
perhaps
take
for
a
bottle
stands
for
there
are
certain
people
in
my
country
to
whom
this
hieroglyphic
should
appear
exceedingly
appropriate
this
which
comes
after
it
is
a
shield
upon
an
arm
holding
a
lance
that
means
thus
the
two
characters
together
form
this
motto
which
strikes
me
as
a
fine
one
is
a
pray
do
not
fancy
i
can
translate
hieroglyphics
at
sight
it
was
a
man
learned
in
such
matters
who
explained
these
to
me
here
i
will
give
you
my
scarabaeus
whenever
you
feel
some
wicked
corsican
thought
stir
in
you
look
at
my
talisman
and
tell
yourself
you
must
win
the
battle
our
evil
passions
wage
against
us
why
really
i
don
t
preach
at
all
badly
i
shall
think
of
you
miss
nevil
and
i
shall
say
to
myself
say
to
yourself
you
have
a
friend
who
would
be
in
despair
at
the
idea
of
your
being
hanged
and
besides
it
would
be
too
distressing
for
your
ancestors
the
corporals
with
these
words
she
dropped
orso
s
arm
laughing
and
running
to
her
father
papa
she
said
do
leave
those
poor
birds
alone
and
come
and
make
up
poetry
with
us
in
napoleon
s
grotto
chapter
viii
there
is
always
a
certain
solemnity
about
a
departure
even
when
the
separation
is
only
to
be
a
short
one
orso
and
his
sister
were
to
start
very
early
in
the
morning
and
he
had
taken
his
leave
of
miss
lydia
the
night
before
for
he
had
no
hope
that
she
would
disturb
her
indolent
habits
on
his
account
their
farewells
had
been
cold
and
grave
since
that
conversation
on
the
miss
lydia
had
been
afraid
she
had
perhaps
shown
too
strong
an
interest
in
orso
and
on
the
other
hand
her
jests
and
more
especially
her
careless
tone
lay
heavy
on
orso
s
heart
at
one
moment
he
had
thought
the
young
englishwoman
s
manner
betrayed
a
budding
feeling
of
affection
but
now
put
out
of
countenance
by
her
jests
he
told
himself
she
only
looked
on
him
as
a
mere
acquaintance
who
would
be
soon
forgotten
great
therefore
was
his
surprise
next
morning
when
as
he
sat
at
coffee
with
the
colonel
he
saw
miss
lydia
come
into
the
room
followed
by
his
sister
she
had
risen
at
five
o
clock
and
for
an
englishwoman
and
especially
for
miss
nevil
the
effort
was
so
great
that
it
could
not
but
give
him
some
cause
for
vanity
i
am
so
sorry
you
should
have
disturbed
yourself
so
early
said
orso
no
doubt
my
sister
woke
you
up
in
spite
of
my
injunctions
and
you
must
hate
us
heartily
perhaps
you
wish
i
was
hanged
already
no
said
miss
lydia
very
low
and
in
italian
evidently
so
that
her
father
might
not
hear
her
but
you
were
somewhat
sulky
with
me
yesterday
because
of
my
innocent
jokes
and
i
would
not
have
you
carry
away
an
unpleasant
recollection
of
your
humble
servant
what
terrible
people
you
are
you
corsicans
well
we
shall
meet
soon
i
and
she
held
out
her
hand
a
sigh
was
the
only
answer
orso
could
find
colomba
came
to
his
side
led
him
into
a
window
and
spoke
to
him
for
a
moment
in
an
undertone
showing
him
something
she
held
under
her
mademoiselle
said
orso
to
miss
nevil
my
sister
is
anxious
to
give
you
a
very
odd
present
but
we
corsicans
have
not
much
to
offer
except
our
affection
which
time
never
wipes
out
my
sister
tells
me
you
have
looked
with
some
curiosity
at
this
dagger
it
is
an
ancient
possession
in
our
family
it
probably
hung
once
upon
a
time
at
the
belt
of
one
of
those
corporals
to
whom
i
owe
the
honour
of
your
acquaintance
colomba
thinks
it
so
precious
that
she
has
asked
my
leave
to
give
it
to
you
and
i
hardly
know
if
i
ought
to
grant
it
for
i
am
afraid
you
ll
laugh
at
us
the
dagger
is
beautiful
said
miss
lydia
but
it
is
a
family
weapon
i
can
not
accept
it
it
s
not
my
father
s
dagger
exclaimed
colomba
eagerly
it
was
given
to
one
of
mother
s
ancestors
by
king
theodore
if
the
signorina
will
accept
it
she
will
give
us
great
come
miss
lydia
said
orso
don
t
scorn
a
king
s
dagger
to
a
collector
relics
of
king
theodore
are
infinitely
more
precious
than
those
of
the
most
powerful
of
monarchs
the
temptation
was
a
strong
one
and
already
miss
lydia
could
see
the
effect
the
weapon
would
produce
laid
out
on
a
lacquered
table
in
her
room
at
james
s
place
but
said
she
taking
the
dagger
with
the
hesitating
air
of
one
who
longs
to
accept
and
casting
one
of
her
most
delightful
smiles
on
colomba
dear
signorina
colomba
i
can
not
i
should
not
dare
to
let
you
depart
thus
my
brother
is
with
me
said
colomba
proudly
and
we
have
the
good
gun
your
father
has
given
us
orso
have
you
put
a
bullet
in
it
miss
nevil
kept
the
dagger
and
to
avert
the
danger
consequent
on
instruments
that
cut
or
pierce
to
a
friend
colomba
insisted
on
receiving
a
soldo
in
payment
a
start
had
to
be
made
at
last
yet
once
again
orso
pressed
miss
nevil
s
hand
colomba
kissed
her
and
then
held
up
her
rosy
lips
to
the
colonel
who
was
enchanted
with
this
corsican
politeness
from
the
window
of
the
miss
lydia
watched
the
brother
and
sister
mount
their
horses
colomba
s
eyes
shone
with
a
malignant
joy
which
she
had
never
remarked
in
them
before
the
sight
of
this
tall
strong
creature
with
her
fanatical
ideas
of
savage
honour
pride
written
on
her
forehead
and
curled
in
a
sardonic
smile
upon
her
lips
carrying
off
the
young
man
with
his
weapons
as
though
on
some
errand
recalled
orso
s
fears
to
her
and
she
fancied
she
beheld
his
evil
genius
dragging
him
to
his
ruin
orso
who
was
already
in
the
saddle
raised
his
head
and
caught
sight
of
her
either
because
he
had
guessed
her
thought
or
desired
to
send
her
a
last
farewell
he
took
the
egyptian
ring
which
he
had
hung
upon
a
ribbon
and
carried
it
to
his
lips
blushing
miss
lydia
stepped
back
from
the
window
then
returning
to
it
almost
at
once
she
saw
the
two
corsicans
cantering
their
little
ponies
rapidly
toward
the
mountains
half
an
hour
later
the
colonel
showed
them
to
her
through
his
glasses
riding
along
the
end
of
the
bay
and
she
noticed
that
orso
constantly
turned
his
head
toward
the
town
at
last
he
disappeared
behind
the
marshes
the
site
of
which
is
now
filled
by
a
flourishing
nursery
garden
miss
lydia
glanced
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
thought
she
looked
pale
what
must
that
young
man
think
of
me
said
she
and
what
did
i
think
of
him
and
why
did
i
think
about
him
a
travelling
acquaintance
what
have
i
come
to
corsica
for
oh
i
don
t
care
for
him
no
no
and
besides
the
thing
is
impossible
and
colomba
fancy
me
to
a
who
wears
a
big
dagger
and
she
noticed
she
was
still
holding
king
theodore
s
dagger
in
her
hand
she
tossed
it
on
to

of

he
is
the

of
a

and
i
have
interrupted
his
adventurous

but
did
he
really
long
to
avenge
his
father
in
true
corsican
fashion
he
was
something
between
a
conrad
and
a
dandy
i
ve
turned
him
into
nothing
but
a
dandy
and
a
dandy
with
a
corsican
tailor
at
this
period
this
name
was
used
in
england
for
people
who
were
the
fashion
because
they
had
something
extraordinary
about
them
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
but
that
proved
an
impossibility
and
i
will
not
undertake
to
continue
her
soliloquy
during
which
she
declared
more
than
a
hundred
times
over
that

was
not
and
never
should
be
anything
to
her
chapter

meanwhile
orso
was
riding
along
beside
his
sister
at
first
the
speed
at
which
their
horses
moved
prevented
all
conversation
but
when
the
hills
grew
so
steep
that
they
were
obliged
to
go
at
a
foot
s
pace
they
began
to
exchange
a
few
words
about
the
friends
from
whom
they
had
just
parted
colomba
spoke
with
admiration
of
miss
nevil
s
beauty
of
her
golden
hair
and
charming
ways
then
she
asked
whether
the
colonel
was
really
as
rich
as
he
appeared
and
whether
miss
lydia
was
his
only
child
she
would
be
a
good
match
said
she
her
father
seems
to
have
a
great
liking
for
you
and
as
orso
made
no
response
she
added
our
family
was
rich
in
days
gone
by
it
is
still
one
of
the
most
respected
in
the
island
all
these
about
us
are
bastards
the
only
noble
blood
left
is
in
the
families
of
the
corporals
and
as
you
know
orso
your
ancestors
were
the
chief
corporals
in
the
island
you
know
our
family
came
from
beyond
the
hills
and
it
was
the
civil
wars
that
forced
us
over
to
this
side
if
i
were
you
orso
i
shouldn
t
hesitate
i
should
ask
colonel
nevil
for
his
daughter
s
orso
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
her
fortune
you
might
buy
the
falsetta
woods
and
the
vineyards
below
ours
i
would
build
a
fine
stone
house
and
add
a
story
to
the
old
tower
in
which
sambucuccio
killed
so
many
moors
in
the
days
of
count
henry
bel
colomba
you
re
talking
nonsense
said
orso
cantering
forward
you
are
a
man
ors
anton
and
of
course
you
know
what
you
ought
to
do
better
than
any
woman
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
objection
that
englishman
could
have
to
the
marriage
are
there
any
corporals
in
england
after
a
somewhat
lengthy
ride
spent
in
talking
in
this
fashion
the
brother
and
sister
reached
a
little
village
not
far
from
bocognano
where
they
halted
to
dine
and
sleep
at
a
friend
s
house
they
were
welcomed
with
a
hospitality
which
must
be
experienced
before
it
can
be
appreciated
the
next
morning
their
host
who
had
stood
godfather
to
a
child
to
whom
madame
della
rebbia
had
been
godmother
accompanied
them
a
league
beyond
his
house
do
you
see
those
woods
and
thickets
said
he
to
orso
just
as
they
were
parting
a
man
who
had
met
with
a
misfortune
might
live
there
peacefully
for
ten
years
and
no
gendarme
or
soldier
would
ever
come
to
look
for
him
the
woods
run
into
the
vizzavona
forest
and
anybody
who
had
friends
at
bocognano
or
in
the
neighbourhood
would
want
for
nothing
that
s
a
good
gun
you
have
there
it
must
carry
a
long
way
blood
of
the
madonna
what
calibre
you
might
kill
better
game
than
boars
with
it
orso
answered
coldly
that
his
gun
was
of
english
make
and
carried
the
lead
a
long
distance
the
friends
embraced
and
took
their
different
ways
our
travellers
were
drawing
quite
close
to
pietranera
when
at
the
entrance
of
a
little
gorge
through
which
they
had
to
pass
they
beheld
seven
or
eight
men
armed
with
guns
some
sitting
on
stones
others
lying
on
the
grass
others
standing
up
and
seemingly
on
the
lookout
their
horses
were
grazing
a
little
way
off
colomba
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
through
a
which
she
took
out
of
one
of
the
large
leathern
pockets
all
corsicans
wear
when
on
a
journey
those
are
our
men
she
cried
with
a
air
pieruccio
had
done
his
errand
well
what
men
inquired
orso
our
herdsmen
she
replied
i
sent
pieruccio
off
yesterday
evening
to
call
the
good
fellows
together
so
that
they
may
attend
you
home
it
would
not
do
for
you
to
enter
pietranera
without
an
escort
and
besides
you
must
know
the
barricini
are
capable
of
anything
colomba
said
orso
and
his
tone
was
severe
i
have
asked
you
over
and
over
again
not
to
mention
the
barricini
and
your
groundless
suspicions
to
me
i
shall
certainly
not
make
myself
ridiculous
by
riding
home
with
all
these
loafers
behind
me
and
i
am
very
angry
with
you
for
having
sent
for
them
without
telling
brother
you
have
forgotten
the
ways
of
your
own
country
it
is
my
business
to
protect
you
when
your
own
imprudence
exposes
you
to
danger
it
was
my
duty
to
do
what
i
have
just
at
that
moment
the
herdsmen
who
had
caught
sight
of
them
hastened
to
their
horses
and
galloped
down
the
hill
to
meet
them

a

despite

in

in

the
group

all
talking
at

and
crowding
round
to
shake
hands
with
him
for
some
time
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
at

with
the

he
put
on
when
he
used
to
reprimand
the
men
of
his
company
or
send
one
of
them
to
the
he
said
i
thank
you

for
the
affection
you
show
for
me
and
for
that
which
you
felt
for
my

but
i

not

of
you
and
you
must
not

it
i

cried
the

yes

do

but
at
this
moment
i

the

departed
trotting
rapidly
off
toward
the
village
but
they
stopped
every
here
and
there
at
all
the
highest
spots
on
the
road
as
though
they
were
looking
out
for
some
hidden
ambuscade
always
keeping

of
skirmishers
the
last
descendant
of
the
della

entered
the
village
and
proceeded
to
the
old
mansion
of
his
forefathers
the
corporals
the
rebbianites
who
had
long
been
leaderless
had
gathered
to
welcome
him
and
those
dwellers
in
the
village
who
observed

doorsteps

and
peeped
out
of

in
their
shutters
the
village
of
pietranera
is
very
irregularly
built
like
most
corsican
villages
for
indeed
to
see
a
street
the
traveller
must
betake
himself
to
cargese
which
was
built
by
monsieur
de
marboeuf
the
houses
scattered
irregularly
about
without
the
least
attempt
at
orderly
arrangement
cover
the
top
of
a
small
plateau
or
rather
of
a
ridge
of
the
mountain
toward
the
centre
of
the
village
stands
a
great
evergreen
oak
and
close
beside
it
may
be
seen
a
granite
trough
into
which
the
water
of
a
neighbouring
spring
is
conveyed
by
a
wooden
pipe
this
monument
of
public
utility
was
constructed
at
the
common
expense
of
the
della
rebbia
and
barricini
families
but
the
man
who
imagined
this
to
be
a
sign
of
former
friendship
between
the
two
families
would
be
sorely
mistaken
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
outcome
of
their
mutual
jealousy
once
upon
a
time
colonel
della
rebbia
sent
a
small
sum
of
money
to
the
municipal
council
of
his
commune
to
help
to
provide
a
fountain
the
lawyer
barricini
hastened
to
forward
a
similar
gift
and
to
this
generous
strife
pietranera
owes
its
water
supply
round
about
the
evergreen
oak
and
the
fountain
there
is
a
clear
space
known
as
the
square
on
which
the
local
idlers
gather
every
night
sometimes
they
play
at
cards
and
once
a
year
in
they
dance
at
the
two
ends
of
the
square
stands
two
edifices
of
greater
height
than
breadth
built
of
a
mixture
of
granite
and
schist
these
are
the
of
the
two
opposing
families
the
barricini
and
the
della
rebbia
their
architecture
is
exactly
alike
their
height
is
similar
and
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
rivalry
of
the
two
families
has
never
been
absolutely
decided
by
any
stroke
of
fortune
in
favor
of
either
it
may
perhaps
be
well
to
explain
what
should
be
understood
by
this
word
it
is
a
square
building
some
forty
feet
in
height
which
in
any
other
country
would
be
simply
described
as
a
a
narrow
eight
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ground
is
reached
by
a
very
steep
flight
of
steps
above
the
door
is
a
window
in
front
of
which
runs
a
sort
of
balcony
the
floor
of
which
is
pierced
with
openings
like
a
machicolation
through
which
the
inhabitants
may
destroy
an
unwelcome
visitor
without
any
danger
to
themselves
between
the
window
and
the
door
are
two
escutcheons
roughly
carved
one
of
these
bears
what
was
originally
a
genoese
cross
now
so
battered
that
nobody
but
an
antiquary
could
recognise
it
on
the
other
are
chiselled
the
arms
of
the
family
to
whom
the
tower
belongs
if
the
reader
will
complete
this
scheme
of
decoration
by
imagining
several
bullet
marks
on
the
escutcheons
and
on
the
window
frames
he
will
have
a
fair
idea
of
a
corsican
mansion
dating
from
the
middle
ages
i
had
forgotten
to
add
that
the
adjoins
the
tower
and
is
frequently
connected
with
it
by
some
interior
passage
the
della

house
and
tower
stand
on
the
northern
side
of
the
square
at
pietranera
the
barricini
house
and
tower
are
on
the
southern
side
since
the
colonel

wife
had
been
buried
no
member
of
either
family
had
ever
been
seen
on
any
side
of
the

that

by
tacit
agreement
to
its
own
party
orso
was
about
to
ride
past
the
mayor

house
when
his
sister
checked
him
and
suggested
his
turning
down
a
lane
that
would
take
them
to
their
own
dwelling
without
crossing
the
square
at
all
why
should
we
go
out
of
our
way
said
orso
doesn

the

belong
to
everybody

he
rode
on

my

you
will
be
avenged

they
reached

put

big
logs

used
to
close

the
lower
parts
of
the
windows
when
an
onslaught
is
expected
this

of

used

from
behind

fire
at

safety

cowards

look
brother
they
have
begun
to
protect
themselves
they

put
up

but
some
day
or
other
they
ll
have
to
come
orso
s
presence
on
the
southern
side
of
the
square
made
a
great
sensation
at
pietranera
and
was
taken
to
be
a
proof
of
boldness
savouring
of
temerity
it
was
subject
of
endless
comment
on
the
part
of
the
neutrals
when
they
gathered
around
the
evergreen
oak
that
night
it
is
a
good
thing
they
said
that
barricini
s
sons
are
not
back
yet
for
they
are
not
so
patient
as
the
lawyer
and
very
likely
they
would
not
have
let
their
enemy
set
his
foot
on
their
ground
without
making

orso
had
been
parted
from
his
father
at
so
early
an
age
that
he
had
scarcely
had
time
to
know
him
he
had
left
pietranera
to
pursue
his
studies
at
pisa
when
he
was
only
fifteen
thence
he
had
passed
into
the
military
school
and
ghilfuccio
meanwhile
was
bearing
the
imperial
eagles
all
over
europe
on
the
mainland
orso
only
saw
his
father
at
rare
intervals
and
it
was
not
until
that
he
found
himself
in
the
regiment
he
commanded
but
the
colonel
who
was
an
inflexible
disciplinarian
treated
his
son
just
like
any
other
in
other
words
with
great
severity
orso
s
memories
of
him
were
of
two
kinds
he
recollected
him
at
pietranera
as
the
father
who
would
trust
him
with
his
sword
and
would
let
him
fire
off
his
gun
when
he
came
in
from
a
shooting
expedition
or
who
made
him
sit
down
for
the
first
time
tiny
urchin
as
he
was
at
the
family
then
he
remembered
the
colonel
della
rebbia
who
would
put
him
under
arrest
for
some
blunder

who
never
called
him
anything
but

you
are
not
in
your
right
place
on
parade
you
will
be
confined
to
barracks
three
your
skirmishers
are
five
yards
too
far
from
your
main
body
five
days
in
it
is
five
minutes
past
noon
and
you
are
still
in
your
a
week
in
only
once
at
he
had
said
to
him
well
done
orso
but
be
cautious
but
after
all
these
later
memories
were
not
connected
in
his
mind
with
pietranera
the
sight
of
the
places
so
familiar
to
him
in
his
childish
days
of
the
furniture
he
had
seen
used
by
his
mother
to
whom
he
had
been
fondly
attached
filled
his
soul
with
a
host
of
tender
and
painful
emotions
then
the
gloomy
future
that
lay
before
him
the
vague
anxiety
he
felt
about
his
sister
and
above
all
other
things
the
thought
that
miss
nevil
was
coming
to
his
house
which
now
struck
him
as
being
so
small
so
poor
so
unsuited
to
a
person
accustomed
to
luxury
the
idea
that
she
might
possibly
despise
it
all
these
feelings
made
his
brain
a
chaos
and
filled
him
with
a
sense
of
deep
discouragement
at
supper
he
sat
in
the
great
oaken
chair
blackened
with
age
in
which
his
father
had
always
presided
at
the
head
of
the
family
table
and
he
smiled
when
he
saw
that
colomba
hesitated
to
sit
down
with
him
but
he
was
grateful
to
her
for
her
silence
during
the
meal
and
for
her
speedy
retirement
afterward
for
he
felt
he
was
too
deeply
moved
to
be
able
to
resist
the
attack
she
was
no
doubt
preparing
to
make
upon
him
colomba
however
was
dealing
warily
with
him
and
meant
to
give
him
time
to
collect
himself
he
sat
for
a
long
time
motionless
with
his
head
on
his
hand
thinking
over
the
scenes
of
the
last
fortnight
of
his
life
he
saw
with
alarm
how
every
one
seemed
to
be
watching
what
would
be
his
behaviour
to
the
barricini
already
he
began
to
perceive
that
the
opinion
of
pietranera
was
beginning
to
be
the
opinion
of
all
the
world
to
him
he
would
have
to
avenge
himself
or
be
taken
for
a
coward
but
on
whom
was
he
to
take
vengeance
he
could
not
believe
the
barricini
to
be
guilty
of
murder
they
were
his
family
enemies
certainly
but
only
the
vulgar
prejudice
of
his
could
accuse
them
of
being
murderers
sometimes
he
would
look
at
miss
nevil
s
talisman
and
whisper
the
motto
life
is
a
battle
over
to
himself
at
last
in
a
resolute
voice
he
said
i
will
win
it
strong
in
that
thought
he
rose
to
his
feet
took
up
the
lamp
and
was
just
going
up
to
his
room
when
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
house
it
was
a
very
unusual
hour
for
any
visitor
to
appear
colomba
instantly
made
her
appearance
followed
by
the
woman
who
acted
as
their
servant
it
s
nothing
she
said
hurrying
to
the
door
yet
before
she
opened
it
she
inquired
who
knocked
a
gentle
voice
answered
it
is
instantly
the
wooden
bar
across
the
door
was
withdrawn
and
colomba
reappeared
in
the
followed
by
a
little
ragged
girl
of
about
ten
years
old
her
head
bound
with
a
shabby
kerchief
from
which
escaped
long
locks
of
hair
as
black
as
the
raven
s
wing
the
child
was
thin
and
pale
her
skin
was
sunburnt
but
her
eyes
shone
with
intelligence
when
she
saw
orso
she
stopped
shyly
and
courtesied
to
him
peasant
fashion
then
she
said
something
in
an
undertone
to
colomba
and
gave
her
a
freshly
killed
pheasant
thanks
chili
said
colomba
thank
your
uncle
for
me
is
he
well
very
well
signorina
at
your
service
i
couldn
t
come
sooner
because
he
was
late
i
waited
for
him
in
the
for
three
and
you
ve
had
no
supper
why

signorina
i
ve
not
had
you

have
some

your
uncle

little
signorina
but
what
he
is
most
short
of
is
powder

the
chestnuts

in
the
only
other
thing
he
wants
is
i
will
give
you
a
loaf
for
him
and
some
powder

him
to
use
it
sparingly
it
is
very
colomba
said
orso
in
french
on
whom
are
you
bestowing
your
charity
on
a
poor
bandit
belonging
to
this
village
replied
colomba
in
the
same
language
this
little
girl
is
his
it
strikes
me
you
might
place
your
gifts
better
why
should
you
send
powder
to
a
ruffian
who
will
use
it
to
commit
crimes
but
for
the
deplorable
weakness
every
one
here
seems
to
have
for
the
bandits
they
would
have
disappeared
out
of
corsica
long
the
worst
men
in
our
country
are
not
those
who
are
in
the
give
them
bread
if
it
so
please
you
but
i
will
not
have
you
supply
them
with
brother
said
colomba
in
a
serious
voice
you
are
master
here
and
everything
in
this
house
belongs
to
you
but
i
warn
you
that
i
will
give
this
little
girl
my
so
that
she
may
sell
it
rather
than
refuse
powder
to
a
bandit
refuse
to
give
him
powder
i
might
just
as
well
make
him
over
to
the
gendarmes
what
has
he
to
protect
him
against
them
except
his
cartridges
all
this
while
the
little
girl
was
ravenously
devouring
a
bit
of
bread
and
carefully
watching
colomba
and
her
brother
turn
about
trying
to
read
the
meaning
of
what
they
were
saying
in
their
eyes
and
what
has
this
bandit
of
yours
done
what
crime
has
driven
him
into
the
brandolaccio
has
not
committed
any
crime
exclaimed
colomba
he
killed
giovan
oppizo
who
murdered
his
father
while
he
was
away
serving
in
the
army
orso
turned
away
his
head
took
up
the
lamp
and
without
a
word
departed
to
his
bedroom
then
colomba
gave
the
child
food
and
gunpowder
and
went
with
her
as
far
as
the
saying
over
and
over
again
mind
your
uncle
takes
good
care
of
orso
chapter
xi
it
was
long
before
orso
fell
asleep
and
as
a
consequence
he
woke
late
late
for
a
corsican
at
all
events
when
he
left
his
bed
the
first
object
that
struck
his
gaze
was
the
house
of
his
enemies
and
the
with
which
they
had
furnished
it
he
went
downstairs
and
asked
for
his
sister
she
is
in
the
kitchen
melting
bullets
answered
saveria
the
so
he
could
not
take
a
step
without
being
pursued
by
the
image
of
war
he
found
colomba
sitting
on
a
stool
surrounded
by
freshly
cast
bullets
and
cutting
up
strips
of
lead
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
inquired
her
brother
you
had
no
bullets
for
the
colonel
s
gun
she
answered
in
her
soft
voice
i
found
i
had
a
mould
for
that
calibre
and
you
shall
have
cartridges
i
don
t
need
them
thank
god
you
mustn
t
be
taken
at
a
disadvantage
ors
anton
you
have
forgotten
your
country
and
the
people
who
are
about
if
i
had
forgotten
you
would
soon
have
reminded
me
tell
me
did
not
a
big
trunk
arrive
here
some
days
ago
yes
brother
shall
i
take
it
up
to
your
room
you
take
it
up
why
you
d
never
be
strong
enough
even
to
lift
it
is
there
no
man
about
who
can
do
it
i
m
not
so
weak
as
you
think
said
colomba
turning
up
her
sleeves
and
displaying
a
pair
of
round
white
arms
perfect
in
shape
but
looking
more
than
ordinarily
strong
here
saveria
said
she
to
the
servant
come
and
help
me
she
was
already
lifting
the
trunk
alone
when
orso
came
hastily
to
her
assistance
there
is
something
for
you
in
this
trunk
my
dear
colomba
said
he
you
must
excuse
the
modesty
of
my
gifts
a
lieutenant
on
hasn
t
a
very
purse
as
he
spoke
he
opened
the
trunk
and
took
out
of
it
a
few
gowns
a
shawl
and
some
other
things
likely
to
be
useful
to
a
young
girl
what
beautiful
things
cried
colomba
i
ll
put
them
away
at
once
for
fear
they
should
be
spoiled
i
ll
keep
them
for
my
wedding
she
added
with
a
sad
smile
for
i
am
in
mourning
now
and
she
kissed
her
brother
s
hand
it
looks
affected
my
dear
sister
to
wear
your
mourning
for
so
i
have
sworn
an
oath
said
colomba
resolutely
i
ll
not
take
off
my
mourning
and
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
barricini
mansion
until
your
wedding
day
said
orso
trying
to
avoid
the
end
of
her
sentence
i
shall
never
marry
any
man
said
colomba
unless
he
has
done
three
things
and
her
eyes
still
rested
gloomily
on
the
house
of
the
enemy
you
are
so
pretty
colomba
that
i
wonder
you
are
not
married
already
come
you
must
tell
me
about
your
suitors
and
besides
i
m
sure
to
hear
their
serenades
they
must
be
good
ones
to
please
a
great
like
who
would
seek
the
hand
of
a
poor
orphan
girl
and
then
the
man
for
whom
i
would
change
my
will
have
to
make
the
women
over
there
put
on
mourning
this
is
becoming
a
perfect
mania
said
orso
to
himself
but
to
avoid
discussion
he
said
nothing
at
all
brother
said
colomba
caressingly
i
have
something
to
give
you
too
the
clothes
you
are
wearing
are
much
too
grand
for
this
country
your
fine
cloth
would
be
in
tatters
in
two
days
if
you
wore
it
in
the
you
must
keep
it
for
the
time
when
miss
nevil
then
opening
a
cupboard
she
took
out
a
complete
hunting
dress
i
ve
made
you
a
velvet
jacket
and
here
s
a
cap
such
as
our
smart
young
men
wear
i
embroidered
it
for
you
ever
so
long
ago
will
you
try
them
on
and
she
made
him
put
on
a
loose
green
velvet
jacket
with
a
huge
pocket
at
the
back
on
his
head
she
set
a
pointed
black
velvet
cap
embroidered
with
jet
and
silk
of
the
same
colour
and
finished
with
a
sort
of
tassel
here
is
our
father
s
she
said
his
stiletto
is
in
the
pocket
of
the
jacket
i
ll
fetch
you
his
carchera
a
belt
for
cartridges
a
pistol
is
worn
fastened
to
the
left
side
of
it
i
look
like
a
brigand
at
the
said
orso
as
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
little
glass
saveria
was
holding
up
for
him
indeed
you
look
dressed
like
that
ors
anton
said
the
old
servant
and
the
smartest
in
bocognano
or
bastelica
is
not
pinsuto
the
name
given
to
men
who
wear
the
pointed
cap
orso
wore
his
new
clothes
at
breakfast
and
during
that
meal
he
told
his
sister
that
his
trunk
contained
a
certain
number
of
books
that
he
was
going
to
send
to
france
and
italy
for
others
and
intended
she
should
study
a
great
deal
for
it
really
is
disgraceful
colomba
he
added
that
a
girl
like
you
should
still
be
ignorant
of
things
that
children
on
the
mainland
know
as
soon
as
they
are
you
are
right
brother
said
colomba
i
know
my
own
shortcomings
quite
well
and
i
shall
be
too
glad
to
learn
especially
if
you
are
kind
enough
to
teach
some
days
went
by
and
colomba
never
mentioned
the
name
of
barricini
she
lavished
care
and
attention
on
her
brother
and
often
talked
to
him
about
miss
nevil
orso
made
her
read
french
and
italian
books
and
was
constantly
being
surprised
either
by
the
correctness
and
good
sense
of
her
comments
or
by
her
utter
ignorance
on
the
most
ordinary
subjects
one
morning
after
breakfast
colomba
left
the
room
for
a
moment
and
instead
of
returning
as
usual
with
a
book
and
some
sheets
of
paper
reappeared
with
her
on
her
head
the
expression
of
her
countenance
was
even
more
serious
than
it
generally
was
brother
she
said
i
want
you
to
come
out
with
where
do
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
said
orso
holding
out
his
arm
i
don
t
want
your
arm
brother
but
take
your
gun
and
your
a
man
should
never
go
abroad
without
his
so
be
it
i
must
follow
the
fashion
where
are
we
going
colomba
without
answering
drew
her
closer
about
her
head
called
the
and
went
out
followed
by
her
brother
striding
swiftly
out
of
the
village
she
turned
into
a
sunken
road
that
wound
among
the
vineyards
sending
on
the
dog
to
whom
she
made
some
gesture
which
he
seemed
to
understand
in
front
of
her
he
instantly
began
to
run
zigzag
fashion
through
the
vines
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
always
keeping
within
about
fifty
paces
of
his
mistress
and
occasionally
stopping
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
wagging
his
tail
he
seemed
to
perform
his
duties
as
a
scout
in
the
most
perfect
fashion
imaginable
if
muschetto
begins
to
bark
brother
said
colomba
cock
your
gun
and
stand
half
a
mile
beyond
the
village
after
making
many
detours
colomba
stopped
short
just
where
there
was
a
bend
in
the
road
on
that
spot
there
rose
a
little
pyramid
of
branches
some
of
them
green
some
withered
heaped
about
three
feet
high
above
them
rose
the
top
of
a
wooden
cross
painted
black
in
several
of
the
corsican
cantons
especially
those
among
the
mountains
a
very
ancient
custom
connected
it
may
be
with
some
pagan
superstition
constrains
every
to
cast
either
a
stone
or
a
branch
on
the
spot
whereon
a
man
has
died
a
violent
death
for
years
and
years
as
long
as
the
memory
of
his
tragic
fate
endures
this
strange
offering
goes
on
accumulating
from
day
to
day
this
is
called
the
dead
man
s
his
colomba
stopped
before
the
heap
of
foliage
broke
off
an
arbutus
branch
and
cast
it
on
the
pile
orso
she
said
this
is
where
your
father
died
let
us
pray
for
his
soul
and
she
knelt
down
orso
instantly
followed
her
example
at
that
moment
the
village
tolled
slowly
for
a
man
who
had
died
during
the
preceding
night
orso
burst
into
tears
after
a
few
minutes
colomba
rose
her
eyes
were
dry
but
her
face
was
eager
she
hastily
crossed
herself
with
her
thumb
after
the
fashion
generally
adopted
by
her
companions
to
seal
any
solemn
oath
then
hurrying
her
brother
with
her
she
took
her
way
back
to
the
village
they
their
house
in
silence
orso
went
up
to
his
room
a
moment
afterward
colomba
followed
him
carrying
a
small
casket
which
she
set
upon
the
table
opening
it
she
drew
out
a
shirt
covered
with
great
stains
of
blood
here
is
your
father
s
shirt
orso
and
she
threw
it
across
his
knees
here
is
the
lead
that
killed
him
and
she
laid
two
blackened
bullets
on
the
shirt
orso
brother
she
cried
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
and
clasping
him
desperately
to
her
orso
you
will
avenge
him
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
she
kissed
him
then
kissed
the
shirt
and
the
bullets
and
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
her
brother
sitting
on
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
turned
to
stone
for
some
time
orso
sat
motionless
not
daring
to
put
the
terrible
relics
away
at
last
with
an
effort
he
laid
them
back
in
their
box
rushed
to
the
opposite
end
of
his
room
and
threw
himself
on
his
bed
with
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
his
head
buried
in
his
pillow
as
though
he
were
trying
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
some
ghost
his
sister
s
last
words
rang
unceasingly
in
his
ears
like
the
words
of
an
oracle
fatal
inevitable
calling
out
to
him
for
blood
and
for
innocent
blood
i
shall
not
attempt
to
depict
the
unhappy
young
man
s
sensations
which
were
as
confused
as
those
that
overwhelm
a
madman
s
brain
for
a
long
time
he
lay
in
the
same
position
without
daring
to
turn
his
head
at
last
he
got
up
closed
the
lid
of
the
casket
and
rushed
headlong
out
of
the
house
into
the
open
country
moving
aimlessly
forward
whither
he
knew
not
by
degrees
the
fresh
air
did
him
good
he
grew
calmer
and
began
to
consider
his
position
and
his
means
of
escape
from
it
with
some
composure
he
did
not
as
my
readers
already
know
suspect
the
barricini
of
the
murder
but
he
did
accuse
them
of
having
forged
agostini
s
letter
and
this
letter
he
believed
at
any
rate
had
brought
about
his
father
s
death
he
felt
it
was
impossible
to
prosecute
them
for
the
forgery
now
and
then
when
the
prejudices
or
the
instincts
of
his
race
assailed
him
and
suggested
an
easy
vengeance
a
shot
fired
at
the
corner
of
some
path
the
thought
of
his
of
parisian
and
above
all
of
miss
nevil
made
him
shrink
from
them
in
horror
then
his
mind
dwelt
on
his
sister
s
reproaches
and
all
the
corsican
within
him
justified
her
appeal
and
even
intensified
its
bitterness
one
hope
alone
remained
to
him
in
this
battle
between
his
conscience
and
his
prejudices
the
hope
that
on
some
pretext
or
other
he
might
pick
a
quarrel
with
one
of
the
lawyer
s
sons
and
fight
a
duel
with
him
the
idea
of
killing
the
young
man
either
by
a
bullet
or
a
reconciled
his
french
and
corsican
ideas
this
expedient
adopted
he
began
to
meditate
means
for
its
execution
and
was
feeling
relieved
already
of
a
heavy
burden
when
other
and
gentler
thoughts
contributed
still
further
to
calm
his
feverish
agitation
cicero
in
his
despair
at
the
death
of
his
daughter
tullia
forgot
his
sorrow
when
he
mused
over
all
the
fine
things
he
might
say
about
it
shandy
consoled
himself
by
discourses
of
the
same
nature
for
the
loss
of
his
son
orso
cooled
his
blood
by
thinking
that
he
would
depict
his
state
of
mind
to
miss
nevil
and
that
such
a
picture
could
not
fail
to
interest
that
fair
lady
deeply
he
was
drawing
near
the
village
from
which
he
had
unconsciously
travelled
a
considerable
distance
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
a
little
girl
who
probably
believed
herself
to
be
quite
alone
singing
in
a
path
that
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
it
was
one
of
those
slow
monotonous
airs
consecrated
to
funeral
dirges
and
the
child
was
singing
the
words
and
when
my
son
shall
see
again
the
dwelling
of
his
father
give
him
that
murdered
father
s
cross
show
him
my
shirt
what
s
that
you
re
singing
child
said
orso
in
an
angry
voice
as
he
suddenly
appeared
before
her
is
that
you
ors
anton
exclaimed
the
child
rather
startled
it
is
signorina
colomba
s
i
forbid
you
to
sing
it
said
orso
in
a
threatening
voice
the
child
kept
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
as
though
looking
about
for
a
way
of
escape
and
she
would
certainly
have
run
off
had
she
not
been
held
back
by
the
necessity
of
taking
care
of
a
large
bundle
which
lay
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
orso
felt
ashamed
of
his
own
vehemence
what
are
you
carrying
there
little
one
said
he
with
all
the
gentleness
he
could
muster
and
as
chilina
hesitated
he
lifted
up
the
linen
that
was
wrapped
round
the
bundle
and
saw
it
contained
a
loaf
of
bread
and
other
food
to
whom
are
you
bringing
the
loaf
my
dear
he
asked
again
you
know
quite
well
ors
anton
to
my
and
isn
t
your
uncle
a
bandit
at
your
service
ors
anton
if
you
met
the
gendarmes
they
would
ask
you
where
you
were
going
i
should
tell
them
the
child
replied
at
once
that
i
was
taking
food
to
the
men
from
lucca
who
were
cutting
down
the
and
if
you
came
across
some
hungry
hunter
who
insisted
on
dining
at
your
expense
and
took
your
provisions
away
from
you
nobody
would
dare
i
would
say
they
are
for
my
uncle
well
he
s
not
the
sort
of
man
to
let
himself
be
cheated
of
his
dinner
is
your
uncle
very
fond
of
you
oh
yes
ors
anton
ever
since
my
father
died
he
has
taken
care
of
my
whole
family
my
mother
and
my
little
sister
and
me
before
mother
was
ill
he
used
to
recommend
her
to
rich
people
who
gave
her
employment
the
mayor
gives
me
a
frock
every
year
and
the
priest
has
taught
me
my
catechism
and
how
to
read
ever
since
my
uncle
spoke
to
them
about
us
but
your
sister
is
kindest
of
all
to
us
just
at
this
moment
a
dog
ran
out
on
the
pathway
the
little
girl
put
two
of
her
fingers
into
her
mouth
and
gave
a
shrill
whistle
the
dog
came
to
her
at
once
fawned
upon
her
and
then
plunged
swiftly
into
the
thicket
soon
two
men
but
very
well
armed
rose
up
out
of
a
clump
of
young
wood
a
few
paces
from
where
orso
stood
it
was
as
though
they
had
crawled
up
like
snakes
through
the
tangle
of
cytisus
and
myrtle
that
covered
the
ground
oh
ors
anton
you
re
welcome
said
the
elder
of
the
two
men
why
don
t
you
remember
me
no
said
orso
looking
hard
at
him
queer
how
a
beard
and
a
peaked
cap
alter
a
man
come
monsieur
look
at
me
well
have
you
forgotten
your
old
waterloo
men
don
t
you
remember
brando
savelli
who
bit
open
more
than
one
cartridge
alongside
of
you
on
that
unlucky
day
what
is
it
you
said
orso
and
you
deserted
in
even
so
sir
faith
soldiering
grows
tiresome
and
besides
i
had
a
job
to
settle
over
in
this
country
aha
chili

re
a
good
girl
give
us
our
dinner
at
once

re
hungry
you
ve
no
notion
what
an
appetite

gets
in
the
who
sent
us
this
was
it
signorina
colomba
or
the
mayor
no
uncle
it
was
the
miller
s
wife
she
gave
me
this
for
you
and
a
blanket
for
my
what
does
she
want
of
me
she
says
the
lucchesi
she
hired
to
clear
the
are
asking
her
sous
and
chestnuts
as
well
because
of
the
fever
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
lazy
scamps
i
ll
see
to
them
will
you
share
our
dinner
monsieur
without
any
ceremony
we
ve
eaten
worse
meals
together
in
the
days
of
that
poor
compatriot
of
ours
whom
they
have
discharged
from
the
no
i
thank
you
heartily
they
have
discharged
me
too
yes
so
i
heard
but
i
ll
wager
you
weren
t
sorry
for
it
you
have
your
own
account
to
settle
too
come
along
cure
said
the
bandit
to
his
comrade
let
s
dine
signor
orso
let
me
introduce
the
cure
i
m
not
quite
sure
he
is
a
cure
but
he
knows
as
much
as
any
priest
at
all
events
a
poor
student
of
theology
monsieur
quoth
the
second
bandit
who
has
been
prevented
from
following
his
vocation
who
knows
brandolaccio
i
might
have
been
pope
what
was
it
that
deprived
the
church
of
your
learning
inquired
orso
a
mere
nothing
a
bill
that
had
to
be
settled
as
my
friend
brandolaccio
puts
it
one
of
my
sisters
had
been
making
a
fool
of
herself
while
i
was
devouring
at
pisa
university
i
had
to
come
home
to
get
her
married
but
her
future
husband
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
he
died
of
fever
three
days
before
i
arrived
then
i
called
as
you
would
have
done
in
my
place
on
the
dead
man
s
brother
i
was
told
he
was
married
what
was
i
to
do
it
really
was
puzzling
what
did
you
do
it
was
one
of
those
cases
in
which
one
has
to
resort
to
the
in
other
words
i
put
a
bullet
in
his
head
said
the
bandit
coolly
orso
made
a
horrified
gesture
nevertheless
curiosity
and
it
may
be
his
desire
to
put
off
the
moment
when
he
must
return
home
induced
him
to
remain
where
he
was
and
continue
his
conversation
with
the
two
men
each
of
whom
had
at
least
one
murder
on
his
conscience
while
his
comrade
was
talking
brandolaccio
was
laying
bread
and
meat
in
front
of
him
he
helped
himself
then
he
gave
some
food
to
this
dog
whom
he
introduced
to
orso
under
the
name
of
brusco
as
an
animal
possessing
a
wonderful
instinct
for
recognising
a
soldier
whatever
might
be
the
disguise
he
had
assumed
lastly
he
cut
off
a
hunch
of
bread
and
a
slice
of
raw
ham
and
gave
them
to
his
niece
oh
the
merry
life
a
bandit
lives
cried
the
student
of
theology
after
he
had
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
you
ll
try
it
some
day
perhaps
signor
della
rebbia
and
you
ll
find
out
how
delightful
it
is
to
acknowledge
no
master
save
one
s
own
fancy
hitherto
the
bandit
had
talked
italian
he
now
proceeded
in
french
corsica
is
not
a
very
amusing
country
for
a
young
man
to
live
in
but
for
a
bandit
there
s
the
difference
the
women
are
all
wild
about
us
i
as
you
see
me
now
have
three
mistresses
in
three
different
villages
i
am
at
home
in
every
one
of
them
and
one
of
the
ladies
is
married
to
a
gendarme
you
know
many
languages
monsieur
said
orso
gravely
if
i
talk
french
tis
because
look
you
debetur
pueris
we
have
made
up
our
minds
brandolaccio
and
i
that
the
little
girl
shall
turn
out
well
and
go
when
she
is
turned
fifteen
remarked
chilina
s
uncle
i
ll
find
a
good
husband
for
her
i
have
one
in
my
eye
shall
you
make
the
proposal
yourself
said
orso
of
course
do
you
suppose
that
any
man
in
this
neighbourhood
to
whom
i
said
i
should
be
glad
to
see
a
marriage
between
your
son
and
michilina
savelli
would
require
any
pressing
i
wouldn
t
advise
him
to
quoth
the
other
bandit
friend
brandolaccio
has
rather
a
heavy
hand
if
i
were
a
rogue
continued
brandolaccio
a
blackguard
a
forger
i
should
only
have
to
hold
my
wallet
open
and
the
pieces
would
rain
into
then
is
there
something
inside
your
wallet
that
attracts
them
said
orso
nothing
but
if
i
were
to
write
to
a
rich
man
as
some
people
have
written
i
want
a
hundred
francs
he
would
lose
no
time
about
sending
them
to
me
but
i
m
a
man
of
honour
do
you
know
signor
della
rebbia
said
the
bandit
whom
his
comrade
called
the
cure
do
you
know
that
in
this
country
with
all
its
simple
habits
there
are
some
wretches
who
make
use
of
the
esteem
our
passports
and
he
touched
his
gun
insure
us
to
draw
forged
bills
in
our
handwriting
i
know
it
said
orso
in
a
gruff
tone
but
what
bills
six
months
ago
said
the
bandit
i
was
taking
my
walks
abroad
near
orezza
when
a
sort
of
lunatic
came
up
to
me
pulling
off
his
cap
to
me
even
in
the
distance
and
said
oh
le
cure
they
always
call
me
that
please
excuse
me
give
me
time
i
have
only
been
able
to
get
francs
together
honour
bright
that
s
all
i
ve
been
able
to
scrape
i
in
my
astonishment
said
francs
what
do
you
mean
you
rascal
i
mean
he
replied
but
as
for
the
hundred
francs
you
asked
me
to
give
you
it
s
not
what
you
villain
i
ask
you
for
a
hundred
francs
i
don
t
know
who
you
then
he
showed
me
a
letter
or
rather
a
dirty
rag
of
paper
whereby
he
was
summoned
to
deposit
a
hundred
francs
on
a
certain
spot
on
pain
of
having
his
house
burned
and
his
cows
killed
by
giocanto
castriconi
that
s
my
name
and
they
had
been
vile
enough
to
forge
my
signature
what
annoyed
me
most
was
that
the
letter
was
written
in
and
was
full
of
mistakes
in
spelling
i
who
won
every
prize
at
the
university
i
began
by
giving
my
rascal
a
cuff
that
made
him
twist
round
and
round
aha
you
take
me
for
a
thief
blackguard
that
you
are
i
said
and
i
gave
him
a
hearty
kick
you
know
where
then
feeling
rather
better
i
went
on
when
are
you
to
take
the
money
to
the
spot
mentioned
in
the
letter
this
very
very
good
then
take
it
there
it
was
at
the
foot
of
a
and
the
place
had
been
exactly
described
he
brought
the
money
buried
it
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
came
and
joined
me
i
had
hidden
myself
close
by
there
i
stayed
with
my
man
for
six
mortal
hours
della
rebbia
i
d
have
staid
three
days
if
it
had
been
necessary
at
the
end
of
six
hours
a
a
vile
made
his
appearance
as
he
bent
down
to
take
up
the
money
i
fired
and
i
had
aimed
so
well
that
as
he
fell
his
head
dropped
upon
the
coins
he
was
unearthing
now
rascal
said
i
to
the
peasant
take
your
money
and
never
dare
to
suspect
giocanto
castriconi
of
a
mean
trick
again
the
poor
devil
all
of
a
tremble
picked
up
his
francs
without
taking
the
trouble
to
wipe
them
he
thanked
me
i
gave
him
a
good
parting
kick
and
he
may
be
running
away
still
for
all
i
ah
cure
said
brandolaccio
i
envy
you
that
shot
how
you
must
have
laughed
i
had
hit
the
in
the
temple
the
bandit
went
on
and
that
reminded
me
of
virgil
s
lines
liquefacto
tempora
plumbo
diffidit
ac
multa
porrectum
extendit
do
you
think
signor
orso
that
the
rapidity
with
which
a
bullet
flies
through
the
air
will
melt
it
you
who
have
studied
projectiles
tell
me
whether
you
think
that
idea
is
truth
or
fiction
orso
infinitely
preferred
discussing
this
question
of
physics
to
arguing
with
the
licentiate
as
to
the
morality
of
his
action
brandolaccio
who
did
not
find
their
scientific
disquisition
entertaining
interrupted
it
with
the
remark
that
the
sun
was
just
going
to
set
as
you
would
not
dine
with
us
ors
anton
he
said
i
advise
you
not
to
keep
mademoiselle
colomba
waiting
any
longer
and
then
it
is
not
always
wise
to
be
out
on
the
roads
after
sunset
why
do
you
come
out
without
a
gun
there
are
bad
folk
about
here
beware
of
them
you
have
nothing
to
fear
the
barricini
are
bringing
the
prefect
home
with
them
they
have
gone
to
meet
him
on
the
road
and
he
is
to
stop
a
day
at
pietranera
before
he
goes
on
to
corte
to
lay
what
they
call
a
such
stupid
nonsense
he
will
sleep
with
the
barricini
but
they
ll
be
disengaged
there
is
vincentello
who
is
a
fellow
and
orlanduccio
who
is
not
much
better
try
to
come
on
them
separately
one
the
other
but
be
on
the
lookout
that
s
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
thanks
for
the
warning
said
orso
but
there
is
no
quarrel
between
us
until
they
come
to
look
for
me
i
shall
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
bandit
stuck
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
and
smacked
it
ironically
but
he
made
no
reply
orso
got
up
to
go
away
by
the
way
said
brandolaccio
i
haven
t
thanked
you
for
your
powder
it
came
just
when
i
needed
it
now
i
have
everything
i
want
at
least
i
do
still
want
shoes
but
i
ll
make
myself
a
pair
out
of
the
skin
of
a
moufflon
one
of
these
orso
slipped
two
pieces
into
the
bandit
s
hand
it
was
colomba
who
sent
you
the
powder
this
is
to
buy
the
nonsense
lieutenant
cried
brandolaccio
handing
him
back
the
two
coins
d
ye
take
me
for
a
beggar
i
accept
bread
and
powder
but
i
won
t
have
anything
else
we
are
both
old
soldiers
so
i
thought
we
might

the

we
shall
meet
again
in

then
we

continue
our
study
of
quite
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
orso
had
parted
company
with
these
worthies
he
heard
a
man
running
after
him
as
fast
as
he
could
go
it
was
brandolaccio
this
is
too
bad
lieutenant
he
shouted
breathlessly
really
it
is
too
bad
i
wouldn

overlook
the
trick
if
any
other
man
had
played
it
on
me
here

have

quite
out

chapter
xii
orso
found
colomba
in
a
state
of
considerable
anxiety
because
of
his
prolonged
absence
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
recovered
her
usual
serene
though
sad
expression
during
the
evening
meal
the
conversation
turned
on
trivial
subjects
and
orso
emboldened
by
his
sister
s
apparent
calm
related
his
encounter
with
the
bandits
and
even
ventured
on
a
joke
or
two
concerning
the
moral
and
religious
education
that
was
being
imparted
to
little
chilina
thanks
to
the
care
of
her
uncle
and
of
his
worthy
colleague
signor
castriconi
brandolaccio
is
an
upright
man
said
colomba
but
as
to
castriconi
i
have
heard
he
is
quite
i
think
said
orso
that
he
is
as
good
as
brandolaccio
and
brandolaccio
is
as
good
as
he
both
of
them
are
at
open
war
with
society
their
first
crime
leads
them
on
to
fresh
ones
every
day
and
yet
they
are
very
likely
not
half
so
guilty
as
many
people
who
don
t
live
in
the
a
flash
of
joy
shone
in
his
sister
s
eyes
yes
he
continued
these
wretches
have
a
code
of
honour
of
their
own
it
is
a
cruel
prejudice
not
a
mean
instinct
of
greed
that
has
forced
them
into
the
life
they
are
there
was
a
silence
brother
said
colomba
as
she
poured
out
his
coffee
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
pietri
died
last
night
yes
he
died
of
the
who
is
pietri
a
man
belonging
to
this
village
the
husband
of
maddalena
who
took
the
out
of
our
father
s
hand
as
he
was
dying
his
widow
has
been
here
to
ask
me
to
join
the
watchers
and
sing
something
you
ought
to
come
too
they
are
our
neighbours
and
in
a
small
place
like
this
we
can
not
do
otherwise
than
pay
them
this
confound
these
wakes
colomba
i
don
t
at
all
like
my
sister
to
perform
in
public
in
this
orso
replied
colomba
every
country
pays
honour
to
its
dead
after
its
own
fashion
the
has
come
down
to
us
from
our
forefathers
and
we
must
respect
it
as
an
ancient
custom
maddalena
does
not
possess
the
gift
and
old
fiordispina
the
best
in
the
country
is
ill
they
must
have
somebody
for
the
do
you
believe
won
t
find
his
way
safely
into
the
next
world
unless
somebody
sings
bad
poetry
over
his
bier
go
if
you
choose
colomba
i
ll
go
with
you
if
you
think
i
ought
but
don
t
improvise
it
really
is
not
fitting
at
your
age
and
sister
i
beg
you
not
to
do
it
brother
i
have
promised
it
is
the
custom
here
as
you
know
and
i
tell
you
again
there
is
nobody
but
me
to
an
idiotic
custom
it
is
it
costs
me
a
great
deal
to
sing
in
this
way
it
brings
back
all
our
own
sorrows
to
me
i
shall
be
ill
after
it
but
i
must
do
it
give
me
leave
to
do
it
brother
remember
that
when
we
were
at
ajaccio
you
told
me
to
improvise
to
amuse
that
young
english
lady
who
makes
a
mock
of
our
old
customs
so
why
should
i
not
do
it
for
these
poor
people
who
will
be
grateful
to
me
and
whom
it
will
help
to
bear
their
grief
well
well
as
you
will
i
ll
go
bail
you
ve
composed
your
already
and
don
t
want
to
waste
no
brother
i
couldn
t
compose
it
beforehand
i
stand
before
the
dead
person
and
i
think
about
those
he
has
left
behind
him
the
tears
spring
into
my
eyes
and
then
i
sing
whatever
comes
into
my
all
this
was
said
so
simply
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
suspect
signorina
colomba
of
the
smallest
poetic
vanity
orso
let
himself
be
persuaded
and
went
with
his
sister
to
pietri
s
house
the
dead
man
lay
on
a
table
in
the
largest
room
with
his
face
uncovered
all
the
doors
and
windows
stood
open
and
several
tapers
were
burning
round
the
table
at
the
head
stood
the
widow
and
behind
her
a
great
many
women
who
filled
all
one
side
of
the
room
on
the
other
side
were
the
men
in
rows
bareheaded
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
corpse
all
in
the
deepest
silence
each
new
arrival
went
up
to
the
table
kissed
the
dead
face
bowed
his
or
her
head
to
the
widow
and
her
son
and
joined
the
circle
without
uttering
a
word
nevertheless
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
persons
present
would
break
the
solemn
silence
with
a
few
words
addressed
to
the
dead
man
why
has
thou
left
thy
good
wife
said
one
old
crone
did
she
not
take
good
care
of
thee
what
didst
thou
lack
why
not
have
waited
another
month
thy
would
have
borne
thee
a
grandson
a
tall
young
fellow
pietri
s
son
pressed
his
father
s
cold
hand
and
cried
oh
why
hast
thou
not
died
of
the
then
we
could
have
avenged
thee
mala
a
violent
death
these
were
the
first
words
to
fall
on
orso
s
ear
as
he
entered
the
room
at
the
sight
of
him
the
circle
parted
and
a
low
murmur
of
curiosity
betrayed
the
expectation
roused
in
the
gathering
by
the
presence
colomba
embraced
the
widow
took
one
of
her
hands
and
stood
for
some
moments
wrapped
in
meditation
with
her
eyelids
dropped
then
she
threw
back
her
gazed
fixedly
at
the
corpse
and
bending
over
it
her
face
almost
as
waxen
as
that
of
the
dead
man
she
began
thus
may
christ
receive
thy
soul
to
live
is
to
suffer
thou
goest
to
a
place
where
there
is
neither
sun
nor
cold
no
longer
dost
thou
need
thy
nor
thy
heavy
pick
there
is
no
more
work
for
thee
henceforward
all
thy
days
are
sundays
may
christ
receive
thy
soul
thy
son
rules
in
thy
house
i
have
seen
the
oak
fall
dried
up
by
the
i
thought
it
was
dead
indeed
but
when
i
passed
it
again
its
root
had
thrown
up
a
sapling
the
sapling
grew
into
an
oak
of
mighty
shade
under
its
great
branches
maddele
rest
thee
well
and
think
of
the
oak
that
is
no
more
here
maddalena
began
to
sob
aloud
and
two
or
three
men
who
on
occasion
would
have
shot
at
a
christian
as
coolly
as
at
a
partridge
brushed
big
tears
off
their
sunburnt
faces
for
some
minutes
colomba
continued
in
this
strain
addressing
herself
sometimes
to
the
corpse
sometimes
to
the
family
and
sometimes
by
a
personification
frequently
employed
in
the
making
the
dead
man
himself
speak
words
of
consolation
or
counsel
to
his
kinsfolk
as
she
proceeded
her
face
assumed
a
sublime
expression
a
delicate
pink
tinge
crept
over
her
features
heightening
the
brilliancy
of
her
white
teeth
and
the
lustre
of
her
flashing
eyes
she
was
like
a
pythoness
on
her
tripod
save
for
a
sigh
here
and
there
or
a
strangled
sob
not
the
slightest
noise
rose
from
the
assembly
that
crowded
about
her
orso
though
less
easily
affected
than
most
people
by
this
wild
kind
of
poetry
was
soon
overcome
by
the
general
emotion
hidden
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
he
wept
as
heartily
as
pietri
s
own
son
suddenly
a
slight
stir
was
perceptible
among
the
audience
the
circle
opened
and
several
strangers
entered
the
respect
shown
them
and
the
eagerness
with
which
room
was
made
for
them
proved
them
to
be
people
of
importance
whose
advent
was
a
great
honour
to
the
household
nevertheless
out
of
respect
for
the
nobody
said
a
word
to
them
the
man
who
had
entered
first
seemed
about
forty
years
of
age
from
his
black
coat
his
red
rosette
his
confident
air
and
look
of
authority
he
was
at
once
guessed
to
be
the
prefect
behind
him
came
a
bent
old
man
with
a
complexion
whose
furtive
and
anxious
glance
was
only
partially
concealed
by
his
green
spectacles
he
wore
a
black
coat
too
large
for
him
and
which
though
still
quite
new
had
evidently
been
made
several
years
previously
he
always
kept
close
beside
the
prefect
and
looked
as
though
he
would
fain
hide
himself
under
his
shadow
last
of
all
behind
him
came
two
tall
young
men
with
sunburnt
faces
their
cheeks
hidden
by
heavy
whiskers
proud
and
and
showing
symptoms
of
an
impertinent
curiosity
orso
had
had
time
to
forget
the
faces
of
his
village
neighbours
but
the
sight
of
the
old
man
in
green
spectacles
instantly
called
up
old
memories
in
his
mind
his
presence
in
attendance
on
the
prefect
sufficed
to
insure
his
recognition
this
was
barricini
the
lawyer
mayor
of
pietranera
who
had
come
with
his
two
sons
to
show
the
prefect
what
a
was
it
would
be
difficult
exactly
to
describe
what
happened
within
orso
s
soul
at
that
moment
but
the
presence
of
his
father
s
foe
filled
him
with
a
sort
of
horror
and
more
than
ever
he
felt
inclined
to
yield
to
the
suspicions
with
which
he
had
been
battling
for
so
long
as
to
colomba
when
she
saw
the
man
against
whom
she
had
sworn
a
deadly
hatred
her
mobile
countenance
assumed
a
most
threatening
aspect
she
turned
pale
her
voice
grew
hoarse
the
line
she
had
begun
to
declaim
died
on
her
lips
but
soon
taking
up
her
afresh
she
proceeded
with
still
greater
vehemence
when
the
hawk
bemoans
himself
beside
his
harried
nest
the
starlings
flutter
round
him
insulting
his
a
smothered
laugh
was
heard
the
two
young
men
who
had
just
come
in
doubtless
considered
the
metaphor
too
bold
the
falcon
will
rouse
himself
he
will
spread
his
wings
he
will
wash
his
beak
in
blood
now
to
thee
let
thy
friends
bid
an
eternal
farewell
long
enough
have
their
tears
flowed
only
the
poor
orphan
girl
will
not
weep
for
thee
wherefore
should
she
moan
thou
has
fallen
asleep
full
of
years
in
the
midst
of
thine
own
kin
ready
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
the
almighty
the
orphan
weeps
for
her
father
overtaken
by
vile
murderers
struck
from
behind
for
her
father
whose
blood
lies
red
beneath
the
green
leaves
but
she
has
gathered
up
this
blood
this
innocent
and
noble
blood
she
has
poured
it
out
over
pietranera
that
it
may
become
a
deadly
poison
and
the
mark
shall
be
on
pietranera
until
the
blood
of
the
guilty
shall
have
wiped
out
the
blood
of
the
innocent
man
as
colomba
pronounced
the
last
words
she
dropped
into
a
chair
drew
her
over
her
face
and
was
heard
sobbing
beneath
it
the
weeping
women
crowded
round
the
several
of
the
men
were
casting
savage
glances
at
the
mayor
and
his
sons
some
of
the
elders
began
to
protest
against
the
scandal
to
which
their
presence
had
given
rise
the
dead
man
s
son
pushed
his
way
through
the
throng
and
was
about
to
beg
the
mayor
to
clear
out
with
all
possible
speed
but
this
functionary
had
not
waited
for
the
suggestion
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
door
and
his
two
sons
were
already
in
the
street
the
prefect
said
a
few
words
of
condolence
to
young
pietri
and
followed
them
out
almost
immediately
orso
went
to
his
sister
s
side
took
her
arm
and
drew
her
out
of
the
room
go
with
them
said
young
pietri
to
some
of
his
friends
take
care
no
harm
comes
to
them
hastily
two
or
three
young
men
slipped
their
stilettos
up
the
left
sleeves
of
their
jackets
and
escorted
orso
and
his
sister
to
their
own
door
chapter
xiii
panting
exhausted
colomba
was
utterly
incapable
of
uttering
a
single
word
her
head
rested
on
her
brother
s
shoulder
and
she
clasped
one
of
his
hands
tightly
between
her
own
orso
though
secretly
somewhat
annoyed
by
her
peroration
was
too
much
alarmed
to
reprove
her
even
in
the
mildest
fashion
he
was
silently
waiting
till
the
nervous
attack
from
which
she
seemed
to
be
suffering
should
have
passed
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
saveria
very
much
flustered
announced
the
prefect
at
the
words
colomba
rose
as
though
ashamed
of
her
weakness
and
stood
leaning
on
a
chair
which
shook
visibly
beneath
her
hand
the
prefect
began
with
some
commonplace
apology
for
the
unseasonable
hour
of
his
visit
condoled
with
mademoiselle
colomba
touched
on
the
danger
connected
with
strong
emotions
blamed
the
custom
of
composing
funeral
dirges
which
the
very
talent
of
the
rendered
the
more
harrowing
to
her
auditors
skilfully
slipped
in
a
mild
reproof
concerning
the
tendency
of
the
improvisation
just
concluded
and
then
changing
his
tone
m
della
rebbia
he
said
i
have
many
messages
for
you
from
your
english
friends
miss
nevil
sends
her
affectionate
regards
to
your
sister
i
have
a
letter
for
you
from
a
letter
from
miss
nevil
cried
orso
unluckily
i
have
not
got
it
with
me
but
you
shall
have
it
within
five
minutes
her
father
has
not
been
well
for
a
little
while
we
were
afraid
he
had
caught
one
of
our
terrible
fevers
luckily
he
is
all
right
again
as
you
will
observe
for
yourself
for
i
fancy
you
will
see
him
very
miss
nevil
must
have
been
very
much
alarmed
fortunately
she
did
not
become
aware
of
the
danger
till
it
was
quite
gone
by
della
rebbia
miss
nevil
has
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
about
you
and
about
your
orso
bowed
she
has
a
great
affection
for
you
both
under
her
charming
appearance
and
her
apparent
frivolity
a
fund
of
good
sense
lies
she
is
a
very
fascinating
person
said
orso
i
have
come
here
monsieur
almost
at
her
prayer
nobody
is
better
acquainted
than
i
with
a
fatal
story
which
i
would
fain
not
have
to
recall
to
you
as
barricini
is
still
the
mayor
of
pietranera
and
as
i
am
prefect
of
the
department
i
need
hardly
tell
you
what
weight
i
attach
to
certain
suspicions
which
if
i
am
rightly
informed
some
incautious
individuals
have
communicated
to
you
and
which
you
i
know
have
spurned
with
the
indignation
your
position
and
your
character
would
have
led
me
to
colomba
said
orso
moving
uneasily
to
his
chair
you
are
very
tired
you
had
better
go
to
colomba
shook
her
head
she
had
recovered
all
her
usual
composure
and
her
burning
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
prefect
m
barricini
the
prefect
continued
is
exceedingly
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
the
sort
of
enmity
or
rather
the
condition
of
uncertainty
existing
between
yourself
and
him
on
my
part
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
you
both
in
those
relations
of
friendly
intercourse
appropriate
to
people
who
certainly
ought
to
esteem
each
monsieur
replied
orso
in
a
shaking
voice
i
have
never
charged
barricini
with
my
father
s
murder
but
he
committed
an
act
which
must
always
prevent
me
from
having
anything
to
do
with
him
he
forged
a
threatening
letter
in
the
name
of
a
certain
bandit
or
at
least
he
hinted
in
an
underhand
sort
of
way
that
it
was
forged
by
my
father
that
letter
monsieur
was
probably
the
indirect
cause
of
my
father
s
the
prefect
sat
thinking
for
a
moment
that
your
father
should
have
believed
that
when
his
own
hasty
nature
led
him
into
a
lawsuit
with
signor
barricini
is
excusable
but
such
blindness
on
your
part
really
can
not
be
admitted
pray
consider
that
barricini
could
have
served
no
interest
of
his
own
by
forging
the
letter
i
will
not
talk
to
you
about
his
character
for
you
are
not
acquainted
with
it
and
are
prejudiced
against
it
but
you
can
not
suppose
that
a
man
conversant
with
the
law
but
monsieur
said
orso
rising
to
his
feet
be
good
enough
to
recollect
that
when
you
tell
me
the
letter
was
not
barricini
s
work
you
ascribe
it
to
my
father
and
my
father
s
honour
monsieur
is
mine
no
man
on
earth
sir
is
more
convinced
of
colonel
della
rebbia
s
honour
than
myself
but
the
writer
of
the
letter
is
now
who
wrote
it
exclaimed
colomba
making
a
step
toward
the
prefect
a
villain
guilty
of
several
crimes
such
crimes
as
you
corsicans
never
pardon
a
thief
one
tomaso
bianchi
at
present
confined
in
the
prison
at
bastia
has
acknowledged
that
he
wrote
the
fatal
i
know
nothing
of
the
man
said
orso
what
can
have
been
his
object
he
belongs
to
this
neighbourhood
said
colomba
he
is
brother
to
a
man
who
was
our
miller
a
scamp
and
a
liar
unworthy
of
you
will
soon
see
what
his
interest
in
the
matter
was
continued
the
prefect
the
miller
of
whom
your
sister
speaks
i
think
his
name
was
teodoro
was
the
tenant
of
a
mill
belonging
to
the
colonel
standing
on
the
very
stream
the
ownership
of
which
barricini
was
disputing
with
your
father
the
colonel
always
a
generous
man
made
very
little
profit
out
of
the
mill
now
tomaso
thought
that
if
barricini
got
possession
of
the
stream
there
would
be
a
heavy
rent
to
pay
for
it
is
well
known
that
barricini
is
rather
fond
of
money
in
short
to
oblige
his
brother
tomaso
forged
the
letter
from
the
bandit
and
there
s
the
whole
story
you
know
that
in
corsica
the
strength
of
the
family
tie
is
so
great
that
it
does
sometimes
lead
to
crime
please
read
over
this
letter
to
me
from
the
it
confirms
what
i
have
just
told
orso
looked
through
the
letter
which
gave
a
detailed
relation
of
tomaso
s
confession
and
colomba
read
it
over
his
shoulder
when
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
it
she
exclaimed
orlanduccio
barricini
went
down
to
bastia
a
month
ago
when
it
became
known
that
my
brother
was
coming
home
he
must
have
seen
tomaso
and
bought
this
lie
of
him
signorina
said
the
prefect
out
of
patience
you
explain
everything
by
odious
imputations
is
that
the
way
to
find
out
the
truth
you
sir
can
judge
more
coolly
tell
me
what
you
think
of
the
business
now
do
you
believe
like
this
young
lady
that
a
man
who
has
only
a
slight
sentence
to
fear
would
deliberately
charge
himself
with
forgery
just
to
oblige
a
person
he
doesn
t
know
orso
read
the
s
letter
again
weighing
every
word
with
the
greatest
care
for
now
that
he
had
seen
the
old
lawyer
he
felt
it
more
difficult
to
convince
himself
than
it
would
have
been
a
few
days
previously
at
last
he
found
himself
obliged
to
admit
that
the
explanation
seemed
to
him
to
be
satisfactory
but
colomba
cried
out
vehemently
tomaso
bianchi
is
a
knave
he
ll
not
be
convicted
or
he
ll
escape
from
prison
i
am
certain
of
it
the
prefect
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
laid
the
information
i
have
received
before
you
monsieur
i
will
now
depart
and
leave
you
to
your
own
reflections
i
shall
wait
till
your
own
reason
has
enlightened
you
and
i
trust
it
may
prove
stronger
than
your
sister
s
orso
after
saying
a
few
words
of
excuse
for
colomba
repeated
that
he
now
believed
tomaso
to
be
the
sole
culprit
the
prefect
had
risen
to
take
his
leave
if
it
were
not
so
late
said
he
i
would
suggest
your
coming
over
with
me
to
fetch
miss
nevil
s
letter
at
the
same
time
you
might
repeat
to
barricini
what
you
have
just
said
to
me
and
the
whole
thing
would
be
orso
della
rebbia
will
never
set
his
foot
inside
the
house
of
a
barricini
exclaimed
colomba
impetuously
this
young
lady
appears
to
be
the
of
the
family
remarked
the
prefect
with
a
touch
of
irony
this
is
the
name
given
to
the
ram
or
which
wears
a
bell
and
leads
the
flock
and
it
is
applied
metaphorically
to
any
member
of
a
family
who
guides
it
in
all
important
matters
monsieur
replied
colomba
resolutely
you
are
deceived
you
do
not
know
the
lawyer
he
is
the
most
cunning
and
knavish
of
men
i
beseech
you
not
to
make
orso
do
a
thing
that
would
overwhelm
him
with
dishonour
colomba
exclaimed
orso
your
passion
has
driven
you
out
of
your
senses
orso
orso
by
the
casket
i
gave
you
i
beseech
you
to
listen
to
me
there
is
blood
between
you
and
the
barricini
you
shall
not
go
into
their
house
sister
no
brother
you
shall
not
go
or
i
will
leave
this
house
and
you
will
never
see
me
again
have
pity
on
me
orso
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
i
am
grieved
said
the
prefect
to
find
mademoiselle
colomba
so
unreasonable
you
will
convince
her
i
am
he
opened
the
door
and
paused
seeming
to
expect
orso
to
follow
him
i
can
not
leave
her
now
said
orso
if
i
shall
be
starting
very
early
said
the
prefect
brother
cried
colomba
clasping
her
hands
wait
till
morning
in
any
case
let
me
look
over
my
father
s
papers
you
can
not
refuse
me
that
well
you
shall
look
them
over
but
at
all
events
you
shall
not
torment
me
afterward
with
your
violent
hatreds
a
thousand
pardons
monsieur
i
am
so
upset
myself
it
had
better
be
the
night
brings
counsel
said
the
prefect
as
he
went
out
i
hope
all
your
uncertainty
will
have
disappeared
by
saveria
colomba
called
take
the
lantern
and
attend
the
signor
prefetto
he
will
give
you
a
letter
to
bring
back
to
my
she
added
a
few
words
which
reached
saveria
s
ear
alone
colomba
said
orso
when
the
prefect
was
gone
you
have
distressed
me
very
much
will
no
evidence
convince
you
you
have
given
me
till
she
replied
i
have
very
little
time
but
i
still
have
some
then
she
took
a
bunch
of
keys
and
ran
up
to
a
room
on
the
upper
story
there
he
could
hear
her
pulling
open
drawers
and
rummaging
in
the
in
which
colonel
della
rebbia
had
kept
his
business
papers
chapter
xiv
saveria
was
a
long
time
away
and
when
she
at
last
reappeared
carrying
a
letter
and
followed
by
little
chilina
rubbing
her
eyes
and
evidently
just
waked
out
of
her
beauty
sleep
orso
was
wound
up
to
the
highest
possible
pitch
of
impatience
chili
said
orso
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
the
signorina
sent
for
me
replied
chilina
what
the
devil
does
she
want
with
her
thought
orso
to
himself
but
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
open
miss
lydia
s
letter
and
while
he
was
reading
it
chilina
went
upstairs
to
his
sister
s
room
my
father
dear
sir
has
not
been
well
miss
nevil
wrote
and
he
is
so
indolent
besides
that
i
am
obliged
to
act
as
his
secretary
you
remember
that
instead
of
admiring
the
landscape
with
you
and
me
the
other
day
he
got
his
feet
wet
on
the
and
in
your
delightful
island
that
is
quite
enough
to
give
one
a
fever
i
can
see
the
face
you
are
making
no
doubt
you
are
feeling
for
your
dagger
but
i
will
hope
you
have
none
now
well
my
father
had
a
little
fever
and
i
had
a
great
fright
the
prefect
whom
i
persist
in
thinking
very
pleasant
sent
us
a
doctor
also
a
very
pleasant
man
who
got
us
over
our
trouble
in
two
days
there
has
been
no
return
of
the
attack
and
my
father
would
like
to
begin
to
shoot
again
but
i
have
forbidden
that
how
did
you
find
matters
in
your
mountain
home
is
your
north
tower
still
in
its
old
place
are
there
any
ghosts
about
it
i
ask
all
these
questions
because
my
father
remembers
you
have
promised
him
buck
and
boar
and
moufflon
is
that
the
right
name
for
those
strange
creatures
we
intend
to
crave
your
hospitality
on
our
way
to
bastia
where
we
are
to
embark
and
i
trust
the
della
rebbia
castle
which
you
declare
is
so
old
and
will
not
fall
in
upon
our
heads
though
the
prefect
is
so
pleasant
that
subjects
of
conversation
are
never
lacking
to
us
i
flatter
myself
by
the
way
that
i
have
turned
his
head
we
have
been
talking
about
your
worshipful
self
the
legal
people
at
bastia
have
sent
him
certain
confessions
made
by
a
rascal
they
have
under
lock
and
key
which
are
calculated
to
destroy
your
last
remaining
suspicions
the
enmity
which
sometimes
alarmed
me
for
you
must
therefore
end
at
once
you
have
no
idea
what
a
pleasure
this
has
been
to
me
when
you
started
hence
with
the
fair
with
your
gun
in
hand
and
your
brow
lowering
you
struck
me
as
being
more
corsican
than
ever
too
corsican
indeed
i
write
you
this
long
letter
because
i
am
dull
the
prefect
alas
is
going
away
we
will
send
you
a
message
when
we
start
for
your
mountains
and
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
writing
to
signorina
colomba
to
ask
her
to
give
me
a
ma
meanwhile
give
her
my
love
i
use
her
dagger
a
great
deal
to
cut
the
leaves
of
a
novel
i
brought
with
me
but
the
doughty
steel
revolts
against
such
usage
and
tears
my
book
for
me
after
a
most
pitiful
fashion
farewell
sir
my
father
sends
you
his
best
listen
to
what
the
prefect
says
he
is
a
sensible
man
and
is
turning
out
of
his
way
i
believe
on
your
account
he
is
going
to
lay
a
at
corte
i
should
fancy
the
ceremony
will
be
very
imposing
and
i
am
very
sorry
not
to
see
it
a
gentleman
in
an
embroidered
coat
and
silk
stockings
and
a
white
scarf
wielding
a
trowel
and
a
speech
and
at
the
end
of
the
performance
manifold
and
reiterated
shouts
of
god
save
the
i
say
again
sir
it
will
make
you
very
vain
to
think
i
have
written
you
four
whole
pages
and
on
that
account
i
give
you
leave
to
write
me
a
very
long
letter
by
the
way
i
think
it
very
odd
of
you
not
to
have
let
me
hear
of
your
safe
arrival
at
the
castle
of
pietranera
lydia
i
beg
you
will
listen
to
the
prefect
and
do
as
he
bids
you
we
have
agreed
that
this
is
the
course
you
should
pursue
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
do
orso
read
the
letter
three
or
four
times
over
making
endless
mental
comments
each
time
as
he
read
then
he
wrote
a
long
answer
which
he
sent
by
saveria
s
hand
to
a
man
in
the
village
who
was
to
go
down
to
ajaccio
the
very
next
day
already
he
had
almost
dismissed
the
idea
of
discussing
his
grievance
true
or
false
against
the
barricini
with
his
sister
miss
lydia
s
letter
had
cast
a
tint
over
everything
about
him
he
felt
neither
hatred
nor
suspicion
now
he
waited
some
time
for
his
sister
to
come
down
and
finding
she
did
not
reappear
he
went
to
bed
with
a
lighter
heart
than
he
had
carried
for
many
a
day
colomba
having
dismissed
chilina
with
some
secret
instructions
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
reading
old
papers
a
little
before
daybreak
a
few
tiny
pebbles
rattled
against
the
at
the
signal
she
went
down
to
the
garden
opened
a
back
door
and
conducted
two
very
rough
men
into
her
house
her
first
care
was
to
bring
them
into
the
kitchen
and
give
them
food
my
readers
will
shortly
learn
who
these
men
were
chapter
xv
toward
six
o
clock
next
morning
one
of
the
prefect
s
servants
came
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
orso
s
house
he
was
received
by
colomba
and
informed
her
the
prefect
was
about
to
start
and
was
expecting
her
brother
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
colomba
replied
that
her
brother
had
just
had
a
fall
on
the
stairs
and
sprained
his
foot
and
he
was
unable
to
walk
a
single
step
that
he
begged
the
prefect
to
excuse
him
and
would
be
very
grateful
if
he
would
condescend
to
take
the
trouble
of
coming
over
to
him
a
few
minutes
after
this
message
had
been
despatched
orso
came
downstairs
and
asked
his
sister
whether
the
prefect
had
not
sent
for
him
with
the
most
perfect
assurance
she
rejoined
he
begs
you
ll
wait
for
him
half
an
hour
went
by
without
the
slightest
perceptible
stir
in
the
barricini
dwelling
meanwhile
orso
asked
colomba
whether
she
had
discovered
anything
she
replied
that
she
proposed
to
make
her
statement
when
the
prefect
came
she
affected
an
extreme
composure
but
her
colour
and
her
eyes
betrayed
her
state
of
feverish
excitement
at
last
the
door
of
the
barricini
mansion
was
seen
to
open
the
prefect
came
out
first
in
travelling
garb
he
was
followed
by
the
mayor
and
his
two
sons
what
was
the
stupefaction
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
of
pietranera
who
had
been
on
the
watch
since
sunrise
for
the
departure
of
the
chief
magistrate
of
their
department
when
they
saw
him
go
straight
across
the
square
and
enter
the
della
rebbia
dwelling
accompanied
by
the
three
barricini
they
are
going
to
make
peace
exclaimed
the
village
politicians
just
as
i
told
you
one
old
man
went
on
ors
anton
has
lived
too
much
on
the
mainland
to
carry
things
through
like
a
man
of
yet
responded
a
rebbianite
you
may
notice
it
is
the
barricini
who
have
gone
across
to
him
they
are
suing
for
it
s
the
prefect
who
had
wheedled
them
all
round
answered
the
old
fellow
there
is
no
such
thing
as
courage
nowadays
and
the
young
chaps
make
no
more
fuss
about
their
father
s
blood
than
if
they
were
all
the
prefect
was
not
a
little
astounded
to
find
orso
up
and
walking
about
with
perfect
ease
in
the
briefest
fashion
colomba
avowed
her
own
lie
and
begged
him
to
forgive
it
if
you
had
been
staying
anywhere
else
monsieur
my
brother
would
have
gone
to
pay
his
respects
to
you
orso
made
endless
apologies
vowing
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
sister
s
absurd
stratagem
by
which
he
appeared
deeply
mortified
the
prefect
and
the
elder
barricini
appeared
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
his
regret
and
indeed
this
belief
was
justified
by
his
evident
confusion
and
the
reproaches
he
addressed
to
his
sister
but
the
mayor
s
two
sons
did
not
seem
satisfied
we
are
being
made
to
look
like
fools
said
orlanduccio
audibly
if
my
sister
were
to
play
me
such
tricks
said
vincentello
i
d
soon
cure
her
fancy
for
beginning
them
the
words
and
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
offended
orso
and
diminished
his
glances
that
were
anything
but
friendly
were
exchanged
between
him
and
the
two
young
men
meanwhile
everybody
being
seated
save
colomba
who
remained
standing
close
to
the
kitchen
door
the
prefect
took
up
his
parable
and
after
a
few
as
to
local
prejudices
he
recalled
the
fact
that
the
most
inveterate
enmities
generally
have
their
root
in
some
mere
misunderstanding
next
turning
to
the
mayor
he
told
him
that
signor
della
rebbia
had
never
believed
the
barricini
family
had
played
any
part
direct
or
indirect
in
the
deplorable
event
which
had
bereft
him
of
his
father
that
he
had
indeed
nursed
some
doubts
as
to
one
detail
in
the
lawsuit
between
the
two
families
that
signor
orso
s
long
absence
and
the
nature
of
the
information
sent
him
excused
the
doubt
in
question
that
in
the
light
of
recent
revelations
he
felt
completely
satisfied
and
desired
to
friendly
and
neighbourly
relations
with
signor
barricini
and
his
sons
orso
bowed
stiffly
signor
barricini
stammered
a
few
words
that
nobody
could
hear
and
his
sons
stared
steadily
at
the
ceiling
rafters
the
prefect
was
about
to
continue
his
speech
and
address
the
counterpart
of
the
remarks
he
had
made
to
signor
barricini
to
orso
when
colomba
stepped
gravely
forward
between
the
contracting
parties
at
the
same
time
drawing
some
papers
from
beneath
her
neckerchief
i
should
be
happy
indeed
she
said
to
see
the
quarrel
between
our
two
families
brought
to
an
end
but
if
the
reconciliation
is
to
be
sincere
there
must
be
a
full
explanation
and
nothing
must
be
left
in
doubt
signor
prefetto
tomaso
bianchi
s
declaration
coming
from
a
man
of
such
vile
report
seemed
to
me
justly
open
to
doubt
i
said
your
sons
had
possibly
seen
this
man
in
the
prison
at
it
s
false
interrupted
orlanduccio
i
didn
t
see
him
colomba
cast
a
scornful
glance
at
him
and
proceeded
with
great
apparent
composure
you
explained
tomaso
s
probable
interest
in
threatening
signor
barricini
in
the
name
of
a
dreaded
bandit
by
his
desire
to
keep
his
brother
teodoro
in
possession
of
the
mill
which
my
father
allowed
him
to
hire
at
a
very
low
that
s
quite
clear
assented
the
prefect
where
was
tomaso
bianchi
s
interest
exclaimed
colomba
triumphantly
his
brother
s
lease
had
run
out
my
father
had
given
him
notice
on
the
of
july
here
is
my
father
s
here
is
his
note
of
warning
given
to
teodoro
and
the
letter
from
a
business
man
at
ajaccio
suggesting
a
new
as
she
spoke
she
gave
the
prefect
the
papers
she
had
been
holding
in
her
hand
there
was
an
astonished
pause
the
mayor
turned
visibly
pale
orso
knitting
his
brows
leaned
forward
to
look
at
the
papers
which
the
prefect
was
perusing
most
attentively
we
are
being
made
to
look
like
fools
cried
orlanduccio
again
springing
angrily
to
his
feet
let
us
be
off
father
we
ought
never
to
have
come
here
one
instant
s
delay
gave
signor
barricini
time
to
recover
his
composure
he
asked
leave
to
see
the
papers
without
a
word
the
prefect
handed
them
over
to
him
pushing
his
green
spectacles
up
to
his
forehead
he
looked
through
them
with
a
somewhat
indifferent
air
while
colomba
watched
him
with
the
eyes
of
a
tigress
who
sees
a
buck
drawing
near
to
the
lair
where
she
had
hidden
her
cubs
well
said
signor
barricini
as
he
pulled
down
his
spectacles
and
returned
the
documents
knowing
the
late
colonel
s
kind
heart
tomaso
thought
most
likely
he
thought
that
the
colonel
would
change
his
mind
about
the
notice
as
a
matter
of
fact
bianchi
is
still
at
the
mill
so
it
was
i
said
colomba
and
there
was
scorn
in
her
voice
who
left
him
there
my
father
was
dead
and
situated
as
i
was
i
was
obliged
to
treat
my
brother
s
dependents
with
yet
quoth
the
prefect
this
man
tomaso
acknowledges
that
he
wrote
the
letter
that
much
is
the
thing
that
is
clear
to
me
broke
in
orso
is
that
there
is
some
vile
infamy
underneath
this
whole
i
have
to
contradict
another
assertion
made
by
these
gentlemen
said
colomba
she
threw
open
the
door
into
the
kitchen
and
instantly
brandolaccio
the
licentiate
in
theology
and
brusco
the
dog
marched
into
the
room
the
two
bandits
were
unarmed
apparently
at
all
events
they
wore
their
cartridge
belts
but
the
pistols
which
are
their
necessary
complement
were
absent
as
they
entered
the
room
they
doffed
their
caps
respectfully
the
effect
produced
by
their
sudden
appearance
may
be
conceived
the
mayor
almost
fell
backward
his
sons
threw
themselves
boldly
in
front
of
him
each
one
feeling
for
his
dagger
in
his
coat
pocket
the
prefect
made
a
step
toward
the
door
and
orso
seizing
brandolaccio
by
the
collar
shouted
what
have
you
come
here
for
you
villain
this
is
a
trap
cried
the
mayor
trying
to
get
the
door
open
but
by
the
bandits
orders
as
was
afterward
discovered
saveria
had
locked
it
on
the
outside
good
people
said
brandolaccio
don
t
be
afraid
of
me
i
m
not
such
a
devil
as
i
look
we
mean
no
harm
at
all
signor
prefetto

m
your
very
humble
servant

strangling
me
we
re
here
as
witnesses
now
then

speak
up
your
tongue
s
glib
enough
signor
prefetto
quoth
the
licentiate
i
have
not
the
honour
of
being
known
to
you
my
name
is
giocanto
castriconi
better
known
as
the
padre
aha
it
s
coming
back
to
you
the
signorina
here
whom
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
either
has
sent
to
ask
me
to
supply
some
information
about
a
fellow
of
the
name
of
tomaso
bianchi
with
whom
i
chanced
to
be
shut
up
about
three
weeks
ago
in
the
prison
at
bastia
this
is
what
i
have
to
tell
spare
yourself
the
trouble
said
the
prefect
i
can
not
listen
to
anything
from
such
a
man
as
you
signor
della
rebbia
i
am
willing
to
believe
you
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
detestable
plot
but
are
you
master
in
your
own
house
will
you
have
the
door
opened
your
sister
may
have
to
give
an
account
of
the
strange
relations
in
which
she
lives
with
a
set
of
signor
prefetto
cried
colomba
i
beseech
you
to
listen
to
what
this
man
has
to
say
you
are
here
to
do
justice
to
everybody
and
it
is
your
duty
to
search
out
the
truth
speak
giocanto
castriconi
don
t
listen
to
him
chorused
the
three
barricini
if
everybody
talks
at
once
remarked
the
bandit
with
a
smile
nobody
can
contrive
to
hear
what
anybody
says
well
in
the
prison
at
bastia
i
had
as
my
companion
not
as
my
friend
this
very
man
tomaso
he
received
frequent
visits
from
signor
you
lie
shouted
the
two
brothers
together
two
negatives
make
an
affirmative
pursued
castriconi
coolly
tomaso
had
money
he
ate
and
drank
of
the
best
i
have
always
been
fond
of
good
cheer
that
s
the
least
of
my
failings
and
in
spite
of
my
repugnance
to
rubbing
shoulders
with
such
a
wretch
i
let
myself
be
tempted
several
times
over
into
dining
with
him
out
of
gratitude
i
proposed
he
should
escape
with
me
a
young
person
to
whom
i
had
shown
some
kindness
had
provided
me
with
the
necessary
means
i
don
t
intend
to
compromise
anybody
tomaso
refused
my
offer
telling
me
he
was
certain
to
be
all
right
as
lawyer
barricini
had
spoken
to
all
the
judges
for
him
and
he
was
sure
to
get
out
of
prison
with
a
character
as
white
as
snow
and
with
money
in
his
pocket
too
as
for
me
i
thought
it
better
to
get
into
the
fresh
air
everything
that
fellow
has
said
is
a
heap
of
lies
reiterated
orlanduccio
stoutly
if
we
were
in
the
open
country
and
each
of
us
had
his
gun
he
wouldn
t
talk
in
that
here
s
a
pretty
folly
cried
brandolaccio
don
t
you
quarrel
with
the
padre
orlanduccio
will
you
be
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
leave
this
room
signor
della
rebbia
said
the
prefect
and
he
stamped
his
foot
in
his
impatience
saveria
saveria
shouted
orso
open
the
door
in
the
devil
s
name
one
moment
said
brandolaccio
we
have
to
slip
away
first
on
our
side
signor
prefetto
the
custom
when
people
meet
in
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
is
to
allow
each
other
half
an
hour
s
law
after
the
prefect
cast
a
scornful
glance
at
him
your
servant
signorina
and
gentlemen
all
said
brandolaccio
then
stretching
out
his
arm
hi
brusco
he
cried
to
his
dog
jump
for
the
signor
prefetto
the
dog
jumped
the
bandits
swiftly
snatched
up
their
arms
in
the
kitchen
fled
across
the
garden
and
at
a
shrill
whistle
the
door
of
the
room
flew
open
as
though
by
magic
signor
barricini
said
orso
and
suppressed
fury
vibrated
in
his
voice
i
hold
you
to
be
a
forger
this
very
day
i
shall
charge
you
before
the
public
prosecutor
with
forgery
and
complicity
with
bianchi
i
may
perhaps
have
a
still
more
terrible
accusation
to
bring
against
you
and
i
signor
della
rebbia
replied
the
mayor
shall
lay
my
charge
against
you
for
conspiracy
and
complicity
with
bandits
meanwhile
the
prefect
will
desire
the
gendarmes
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
prefect
will
do
his
duty
said
that
gentleman
sternly
he
will
see
the
public
order
is
not
disturbed
at
pietranera
he
will
take
care
justice
is
done
i
say
this
to
you
all
gentlemen
the
mayor
and
vincentello
were
outside
the
room
already
and
orlanduccio
was
following
them
stepping
backward
when
orso
said
to
him
in
an
undertone
your
father
is
an
old
man
one
cuff
from
me
would
kill
him
it
is
with
you
and
with
your
brother
that
i
intend
to
orlanduccio
s
only
response
was
to
draw
his
dagger
and
fly
like
a
madman
at
orso
but
before
he
could
use
his
weapon
colomba
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
twisted
it
violently
while
orso
gave
him
a
blow
in
the
face
with
his
fist
which
made
him
stagger
several
paces
back
and
come
into
violent
collision
with
the
door
frame
orlanduccio
s
dagger
dropped
from
his
hand
but
vincentello
had
his
ready
and
was
rushing
back
into
the
room
when
colomba
snatching
up
a
gun
convinced
him
that
the
struggle
must
be
unequal
at
the
same
time
the
prefect
threw
himself
between
the
combatants
we
shall
soon
meet
ors
anton
shouted
orlanduccio
and
slamming
the
door
of
the
room
violently
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
so
as
to
insure
himself
time
to
retreat
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
orso
and
the
prefect
kept
their
places
in
dead
silence
at
opposite
ends
of
the
room
colomba
the
pride
of
triumph
shining
on
her
brow
gazed
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
as
she
leaned
on
the
gun
that
had
turned
the
scale
of
victory
what
a
country
oh
what
a
country
cried
the
prefect
at
last
rising
hastily
from
his
chair
signor
della
rebbia
you
did
wrong
you
must
give
me
your
word
of
honour
to
abstain
from
all
violence
and
to
wait
till
the
law
settles
this
cursed
yes
signor
prefetto
i
was
wrong
to
strike
that
villain
but
i
did
strike
him
after
all
and
i
can
t
refuse
him
the
satisfaction
he
has
demanded
of
pooh
no
he
doesn
t
want
to
fight
you
but
supposing
he
murders
you
you
ve
done
everything
you
could
to
insure
we
ll
protect
ourselves
said
colomba
orlanduccio
said
orso
strikes
me
as
being
a
plucky
fellow
and
i
think
better
of
him
than
that
monsieur
he
was
very
quick
about
drawing
his
dagger
but
perhaps
i
should
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
place
and
i
m
glad
my
sister
has
not
an
ordinary
fine
lady
s
you
are
not
to
fight
exclaimed
the
prefect
i
forbid
it
allow
me
to
say
monsieur
that
in
matters
that
affect
my
honour
the
only
authority
i
acknowledge
is
that
of
my
own
you
sha
n
t
fight
i
tell
you
you
can
put
me
under
arrest
monsieur
that
is
if
i
let
you
catch
me
but
if
you
were
to
do
that
you
would
only
delay
a
thing
that
has
now
become
inevitable
you
are
a
man
of
honour
yourself
monsieur
you
know
there
can
be
no
other
if
you
were
to
have
my
brother
arrested
added
colomba
half
the
village
would
take
his
part
and
we
should
have
a
fine
i
give
you
fair
notice
monsieur
and
i
entreat
you
not
to
think
i
am
talking
mere
bravado
i
warn
you
that
if
signor
barricini
abuses
his
authority
as
mayor
to
have
me
arrested
i
shall
defend
from
this
very
day
said
the
prefect
signor
barricini
is
suspended
i
trust
he
will
exculpate
himself
listen
to
me
my
young
gentleman
i
have
a
liking
for
you
what
i
ask
of
you
is
nothing
to
speak
of
just
to
stay
quietly
at
home
till
i
get
back
from
corte
i
shall
only
be
three
days
away
i
ll
bring
back
the
public
prosecutor
with
me
and
then
we
ll
sift
this
wretched
business
to
the
bottom
will
you
promise
me
you
will
abstain
from
all
hostilities
till
then
i
can
not
promise
that
monsieur
if
as
i
expect
orlanduccio
asks
me
to
meet
what
signor
della
rebbia
would
you
a
french
officer
think
of
going
out
with
a
man
you
suspect
of
being
a
forger
i
struck
him
monsieur
but
supposing
you
struck
a
convict
and
he
demanded
satisfaction
of
you
would
you
fight
him
come
come
signor
orso
but
i
ll
ask
you
to
do
even
less
do
nothing
to
seek
out
orlanduccio
i
ll
consent
to
your
fighting
him
if
he
asks
you
for
a
he
will
ask
for
it
i
haven
t
a
doubt
of
that
but
i
ll
promise
i
won
t
give
him
fresh
cuffs
to
induce
him
to
do
what
a
country
cried
the
prefect
once
more
as
he
strode
to
and
fro
shall
i
never
get
back

colomba
in
her
most
dulcet
tones

honour
of
breakfasting
here
the
prefect
could
not
help
laughing

look
like
partiality

there

what
calamities
you
may
have
prepared

day

signor
prefetto
you
will
do
my
sister
the
justice
of
believing
her
convictions

deeply
rooted

i
am

now
that
you
yourself
believe
them
to

the
prefect
waving
his

i

you
that

have
just
perused
and
delivered
it
into
orlanduccio
s
own
hands
the
answer
was
not
prompt
and
did
not
arrive
till
evening
it
bore
the
signature
of
the
elder
barricini
and
informed
orso
that
he
was
laying
the
threatening
letter
sent
to
his
son
before
the
public
prosecutor
his
missive
concluded
thus
strong
in
the
sense
of
a
clear
conscience
i
patiently
wait
till
the
law
has
pronounced
on
your
meanwhile
five
or
six
herdsmen
summoned
by
colomba
arrived
to
garrison
the
della
rebbia
tower
in
spite
of
orso
s
protests
were
arranged
in
the
windows
looking
onto
the
square
and
all
through
the
evening
offers
of
service
kept
coming
in
from
various
persons
belonging
to
the
village
there
was
even
a
letter
from
the
undertaking
for
himself
and
brandolaccio
that
in
the
event
of
the
mayor
s
calling
on
the
gendarmes
they
themselves
would
straightway
intervene
the
following
postscript
closed
the
letter
dare
i
ask
you
what
the
signor
prefetto
thinks
of
the
excellent
education
bestowed
by
my
friend
on
brusco
the
dog
next
to
chilina
he
is
the
most
docile
and
promising
pupil
i
have
ever
come
chapter
xvi
the
following
day
went
by
without
any
hostile
demonstration
both
sides
kept
on
the
defensive
orso
did
not
leave
his
house
and
the
door
of
the
barricini
dwelling
remained
closely
shut
the
five
gendarmes
who
had
been
left
to
garrison
pietranera
were
to
be
seen
walking
about
the
square
and
the
outskirts
of
the
village
in
company
with
the
village
constable
the
sole
representative
of
the
urban
police
force
the
never
put
off
his
sash
but
there
was
no
actual
symptom
of
war
except
the
loopholes
in
the
two
opponents
houses
nobody
but
a
corsican
would
have
noticed
that
the
group
round
the
evergreen
oak
in
the
middle
of
the
square
consisted
solely
of
women
at
colomba
gleefully
showed
her
brother
a
letter
she
had
just
received
from
miss
nevil
my
dear
signorina
colomba
it
ran
i
learn
with
great
pleasure
through
a
letter
from
your
brother
that
your
enmities
are
all
at
an
end
i
congratulate
you
heartily
my
father
can
not
endure
ajaccio
now
your
brother
is
not
there
to
talk
about
war
and
go
out
shooting
with
him
we
are
starting
and
shall
sleep
at
the
house
of
your
kinswoman
to
whom
we
have
a
letter
the
day
after
somewhere
about
eleven
o
clock
i
shall
come
and
ask
you
to
let
me
taste
that
mountain
of
yours
which
you
say
is
so
vastly
superior
to
what
we
get
in
the
town
farewell
dear
signorina
colomba
your
affectionate
lydia
then
she
hasn
t
received
my
second
letter
exclaimed
orso
you
see
by
the
date
of
this
one
that
miss
lydia
must
have
already
started
when
your
letter
reached
ajaccio
but
did
you
tell
her
not
to
come
i
told
her
we
were
in
a
state
of
siege
that
does
not
seem
to
me
a
condition
that
permits
of
our
receiving
bah
these
english
people
are
so
odd
the
very
last
night
i
slept
in
her
room
she
told
me
she
would
be
sorry
to
leave
corsica
without
having
seen
a
good
if
you
choose
orso
you
might
let
her
see
an
assault
on
our
enemies
do
you
know
colomba
said
orso
nature
blundered
when
she
made
you
a
woman
you
d
have
made
a
maybe
anyhow
i
m
going
to
make
my
don
t
waste
your
time
we
must
send
somebody
down
to
warn
them
and
stop
them
before
they
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
send
a
messenger
out
in
such
weather
to
have
him
and
your
letter
both
swept
away
by
a
torrent
how
i
pity
those
poor
bandits
in
this
storm
luckily
they
have
good
thick
cloth
cloaks
with
hoods
do
you
know
what
you
ought
to
do
orso
if
the
storm
clears
you
should
start
off
very
early
morning
and
get
to
our
kinswoman
s
house
before
they
leave
it
that
will
be
easy
enough
for
miss
lydia
always
gets
up
so
late
you
can
tell
them
everything
that
has
happened
here
and
if
they
still
persist
in
coming
why
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
welcome
orso
lost
no
time
in
assenting
to
this
plan
and
after
a
few
moments
silence
colomba
continued
perhaps
orso
you
think
i
was
joking
when
i
talked
of
an
assault
on
the
barricini
s
house
do
you
know
we
are
in
force
two
to
one
at
the
very
least
now
that
the
prefect
has
suspended
the
mayor
every
man
in
the
place
is
on
our
side
we
might
cut
them
to
pieces
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
bring
it
about
if
you
liked
i
could
go
over
to
the
fountain
and
begin
to
jeer
at
their
women
folk
they
would
come
out
perhaps
they
are
such
cowards
they
would
fire
at
me
through
their
loopholes
they
wouldn
t
hit
me
then
the
thing
would
be
done
they
would
have
begun
the
attack
and
the
beaten
party
must
take
its
chance
how
is
anybody
to
know
which
person
s
aim
has
been
true
in
a
scuffle
listen
to
your
own
sister
orso
these
lawyers
who
are
coming
will
blacken
lots
of
paper
and
talk
a
great
deal
of
useless
stuff
nothing
will
come
of
it
all
that
old
fox
will
contrive
to
make
them
think
they
see
stars
in
broad
midday
ah
if
the
prefect
hadn
t
thrown
himself
in
front
of
vincentello
we
should
have
had
one
less
to
deal
all
this
was
said
with
the
same
calm
air
as
that
with
which
she
had
spoken
an
instant
previously
of
her
preparations
for
making
the
orso
quite
dumfounded
gazed
at
his
sister
with
an
admiration
not
unmixed
with
alarm
my
sweet
colomba
he
said
as
he
rose
from
the
table
i
really
am
afraid
you
are
the
very
devil
but
make
your
mind
easy
if
i
don
t
succeed
in
getting
the
barricini
hanged
i
ll
contrive
to
get
the
better
of
them
in
some
other
fashion
hot
bullet
or
cold
steel
you
see
i
haven
t
forgotten
my
the
sooner
the
better
said
colomba
with
a
sigh
what
horse
will
you
ride
ors
anton
the
black
why
do
you
ask
so
as
to
make
sure
he
has
some
when
orso
went
up
to
his
room
colomba
sent
saveria
and
the
herdsmen
to
their
beds
and
sat
on
alone
in
the
kitchen
where
the
was
simmering
now
and
then
she
seemed
to
listen
and
was
apparently
waiting
very
anxiously
for
her
brother
to
go
to
bed
at
last
when
she
thought
he
was
asleep
she
took
a
knife
made
sure
it
was
sharp
slipped
her
little
feet
into
thick
shoes
and
passed
noiselessly
out
into
the
garden
this
garden
which
was
inclosed
by
walls
lay
next
to
a
piece
of
hedged
ground
into
which
the
horses
were
turned
for
corsican
horses
do
not
know
what
a
stable
means
they
are
generally
turned
loose
into
a
field
and
left
to
themselves
to
find
pasture
and
shelter
from
cold
winds
as
best
they
may
colomba
opened
the
garden
gate
with
the
same
precaution
entered
the
inclosure
and
whistling
gently
soon
attracted
the
horses
to
whom
she
had
often
brought
bread
and
salt
as
soon
as
the
black
horse
came
within
reach
she
caught
him
firmly
by
the
mane
and
split
his
ear
open
with
her
knife
the
horse
gave
a
violent
leap
and
tore
off
with
that
shrill
cry
which
sharp
pain
occasionally
extorts
from
his
kind
quite
satisfied
colomba
was
making
her
way
back
into
the
garden
when
orso
threw
open
his
window
and
shouted
who
goes
there
at
the
same
time
she
heard
him
cock
his
gun
luckily
for
her
the
lay
in
the
blackest
shadow
and
was
partly
screened
by
a
large
she
very
soon
gathered
from
the
light
she
saw
glancing
up
and
down
in
her
brother
s
room
that
he
was
trying
to
light
his
lamp
she
lost
no
time
about
closing
the
and
slipping
along
the
wall
so
that
the
outline
of
her
black
garments
was
lost
against
the
dark
foliage
of
the
and
succeeded
in
getting
back
into
the
kitchen
a
few
moments
before
orso
entered
it
what
s
the
matter
she
inquired
i
fancied
i
heard
somebody
opening
the
said
orso
impossible
the
dog
would
have
barked
but
let
us
go
and
see
orso
went
round
the
garden
and
having
made
sure
that
the
outer
door
was
safely
secured
he
was
going
back
to
his
room
rather
ashamed
of
his
false
alarm
i
am
glad
brother
remarked
colomba
that
you
are
learning
to
be
prudent
as
a
man
in
your
position
ought
to
you
are
training
me
well
said
orso
by
dawn
the
next
morning
orso
was
up
and
ready
to
start
his
style
of
dress
betrayed
the
desire
for
smartness
felt
by
every
man
bound
for
the
presence
of
the
lady
he
would
fain
please
combined
with
the
caution
of
a
corsican
over
a
blue
coat
that
sat
closely
to
his
figure
he
wore
a
small
tin
case
full
of
cartridges
slung
across
his
shoulder
by
a
green
silk
cord
his
dagger
lay
in
his
side
pocket
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
his
handsome
manton
ready
loaded
while
he
was
hastily
swallowing
the
cup
of
coffee
colomba
had
poured
out
for
him
one
of
the
herdsmen
went
out
to
put
the
bridle
and
saddle
on
the
black
horse
orso
and
his
sister
followed
close
on
his
heels
and
entered
the
field
the
man
had
caught
the
horse
but
he
had
dropped
both
saddle
and
bridle
and
seemed
quite
paralyzed
with
horror
while
the
horse
remembering
the
wound
it
had
received
during
the
night
and
trembling
for
its
other
ear
was
rearing
kicking
and
neighing
like
twenty
fiends
now
then
make
haste
shouted
orso
ho
ors
anton
ho
ors
anton
yelled
the
herdsman
holy
madonna
and
he
poured
out
a
string
of
imprecations
numberless
endless
and
most
of
them
quite
untranslatable
what
can
be
the
matter
inquired
colomba
they
all
drew
near
to
the
horse
and
at
the
sight
of
the
creature
s
bleeding
head
and
split
ear
there
was
a
general
outcry
of
surprise
and
indignation
my
readers
must
know
that
among
the
corsicans
to
mutilate
an
enemy
s
horse
is
at
once
a
vengeance
a
challenge
and
a
mortal
threat
nothing
but
a
can
expiate
such
a
though
orso
having
lived
so
long
on
the
mainland
was
not
so
sensitive
as
other
corsicans
to
the
enormity
of
the
insult
still
if
any
supporter
of
the
barricini
had
appeared
in
his
sight
at
that
moment
he
would
probably
have
taken
vengeance
on
him
for
the
outrage
he
ascribed
to
his
enemies
the
cowardly
wretches
he
cried
to
avenge
themselves
on
a
poor
brute
when
they
dare
not
meet
me
face
to
face
what
are
we
waiting
for
exclaimed
colomba
vehemently
they
come
here
and
brave
us
they
mutilate
our
horses
and
we
are
not
to
make
any
response
are
you
men
vengeance
shouted
the
herdsmen
let
us
lead
the
horse
through
the
village
and
attack
their
house
there
s
a
thatched
barn
that
touches
their
tower
said
old
polo
griffo
i
d
set
fire
to
it
in
a
another
man
wanted
to
fetch
the
ladders
out
of
the
church
steeple
a
third
proposed
they
should
break
in
the
doors
of
the
house
with
a
heavy
beam
intended
for
some
house
in
course
of
building
which
had
been
left
lying
in
the
square
amid
all
the
angry
voices
colomba
was
heard
telling
her
satellites
that
before
they
went
to
work
she
would
give
each
man
of
them
a
large
glass
of
anisette
unluckily
or
rather
luckily
the
impression
she
had
expected
to
produce
by
her
own
cruel
treatment
of
the
poor
horse
was
largely
lost
on
orso
he
felt
no
doubt
that
the
savage
mutilation
was
due
to
one
of
his
foes
and
he
specially
suspected
orlanduccio
but
he
did
not
believe
that
the
young
man
whom
he
himself
had
provoked
and
struck
had
wiped
out
his
shame
by
slitting
a
horse
s
ear
on
the
contrary
this
mean
and
ridiculous
piece
of
vengeance
had
increased
orso
s
scorn
for
his
opponents
and
he
now
felt
with
the
prefect
that
such
people
were
not
worthy
to
try
conclusions
with
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
make
himself
heard
he
informed
his
astonished
partisans
that
they
would
have
to
relinquish
all
their
bellicose
intentions
and
that
the
power
of
the
law
which
would
shortly
be
on
the
spot
would
amply
suffice
to
avenge
the
hurt
done
to
a
horse
s
ear
i
m
master
here
he
added
sternly
and
i
insist
on
being
obeyed
the
first
man
who
dares
to
say
anything
more
about
killing
or
burning
will
quite
possibly
get
a
scorching
at
my
hands
be
off
saddle
me
the
gray
horse
what
s
this
orso
said
colomba
drawing
him
apart
you
allow
these
people
to
insult
us
no
barricini
would
have
dared
to
mutilate
any
beast
of
ours
in
my
father
s
i
promise
you
they
shall
have
reason
to
repent
it
but
it
is
gendarme
s
and
jailer
s
work
to
punish
wretches
who
only
venture
to
raise
their
hands
against
brute
beasts
i
ve
told
you
already
the
law
will
punish
them
and
if
not
you
will
not
need
to
remind
me
whose
son

answered
colomba
with
a
sigh

this

continued
orso
if
i
find
when
i
come
back
that
any
demonstration
whatever
has
been
made
against
the
barricini
i
shall
never
forgive
then
in
a
gentler
tone
he
added
very
possibly
very
probably
i
shall
bring
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
back
with
me

that
their
rooms
are
well
prepared
and
that
the
breakfast
is
good
in

let
us
make
our
guests
as
comfortable
as
we
can
it

a
very
good
thing
to
be

know
how
to
manage
her
household

replied
orso
and
i

promise
you
nobody
shall
slit

to
your
going

with
my
after
a
somewhat
lively
argument
orso
had
to
give
in
and
accept
an
escort
from
the
most
excited
of
the
herdsmen
he
chose
out
those
who
had
been
loudest
in
their
desire
to
commence
hostilities
then
after
laying
fresh
injunctions
on
his
sister
and
the
men
he
was
leaving
behind
he
started
making
a
detour
this
time
so
as
to
avoid
the
barricinis
dwelling
they
were
a
long
way
from
pietranera
and
were
travelling
along
at
a
great
pace
when
as
they
crossed
a
streamlet
that
ran
into
a
marsh
polo
griffo
noticed
several
porkers
wallowing
comfortably
in
the
mud
in
full
enjoyment
at
once
of
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
the
coolness
of
the
water
instantly
he
took
aim
at
the
biggest
fired
at
its
head
and
shot
it
dead
the
dead
creature
s
comrades
rose
and
fled
with
astonishing
swiftness
and
though
another
herdsman
fired
at
them
they
reached
a
thicket
and
disappeared
into
it
safe
and
sound
idiots
cried
orso
you
ve
been
taking
pigs
for
wild
boars
not
a
bit
ors

replied
polo

but
that
herd
belongs
to
the

the
herdsmen
stared
at

quite
dumb
orso
spurred
his
horse
galloped
off
and
was
soon
out

s
a
pretty
thing
you
devote
yourself
to
people
and
then
this
is
how
they
treat
you
his
father
the
colonel
was
angry
with
you
long
ago
because
you
levelled
your
gun
at
the
lawyer
great
idiot
you
were
not
to
shoot
and
now
here
is
his
son
you
saw
what
i
did
for
him
and
he
talks
about
cracking
my
skull
just
as
he
would
crack
a
gourd
that
lets
the
wine
leak
out
that
s
what
people
learn
on
the
mainland
memmo
yes
and
if
any
one
finds
out
it
was
you
who
killed
that
pig
there
ll
be
a
suit
against
you
and
ors
anton
won
t
speak
to
the
judges
nor
buy
off
the
lawyer
for
you
luckily
nobody
saw
and
you
have
saint
nega
to
help
you
after
a
hasty
conclave
the
two
herdsmen
concluded
their
wisest
plan
was
to
throw
the
dead
pig
into
a
bog
and
this
project
they
carefully
executed
after
each
had
duly
carved
himself
several
slices
out
of
the
body
of
this
innocent
victim
of
the
feud
between
the
barricini
and
the
della
rebbia
chapter
xvii
once
rid
of
his
unruly
escort
orso
proceeded
calmly
on
his
way
far
more
absorbed
by
the
prospective
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
nevil
than
stirred
by
any
fear
of
coming
across
his
enemies
the
lawsuit
i
must
bring
against
these
barricini
villains
he
mused
will
necessitate
my
going
down
to
bastia
why
should
i
not
go
there
with
miss
nevil
and
once
at
bastia
why
shouldn
t
we
all
go
together
to
the
springs
of
orezza
suddenly
his
childish
recollections
of
that
picturesque
spot
rose
up
before
him
he
fancied
himself
on
the
verdant
lawn
that
spreads
beneath
the
ancient
on
the
lustrous
green
sward
studded
with
blue
flowers
like
eyes
that
smiled
upon
him
he
saw
miss
lydia
seated
at
his
side
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
her
fair
hair
softer
and
finer
than
any
silk
shone
like
gold
in
the
sunlight
that
glinted
through
the
foliage
her
clear
blue
eyes
looked
to
him
bluer
than
the
sky
itself
with
her
cheek
resting
on
one
hand
she
was
listening
thoughtfully
to
the
words
of
love
he
poured
tremblingly
into
her
ear
she
wore
the
muslin
gown
in
which
she
had
been
dressed
that
last
day
at
ajaccio
from
beneath
its
folds
peeped
out
a
tiny
foot
shod
with
black
satin
orso
told
himself
that
he
would
be
happy
indeed
if
he
might
dare
to
kiss
that
little
foot
but
one
of
miss
lydia
s
hands
was
bare
and
held
a
daisy
he
took
the
daisy
from
her
and
lydia
s
hand
pressed
his
and
then
he
kissed
the
daisy
and
then
he
kissed
her
hand
and
yet
she
did
not
chide
him
and
all
these
thoughts
prevented
him
from
paying
any
attention
to
the
road
he
was
travelling
and
meanwhile
he
trotted
steadily
onward
for
the
second
time
in
his
fancy
he
was
about
to
kiss
miss
nevil
s
hand
when
as
his
horse
stopped
short
he
very
nearly
kissed
its
head
in
stern
reality
little
chilina
had
barred
his
way
and
seized
his
bridle
where
are
you
going
to
ors
anton
she
said
don
t
you
know
your
enemy
is
close
by
my
enemy
cried
orso
furious
at
being
interrupted
at
such
a
delightful
moment
where
is
he
orlanduccio
is
close
by
he
s
waiting
for
you
go
back
go
back
ho
ho
so
he
s
waiting
for
me
did
you
see
him
yes
ors
anton
i
was
lying
down
in
the
heather
when
he
passed
by
he
was
looking
round
everywhere
through
his
and
which
way
did
he
go
he
went
down
there
just
where
you
were
going
thank
you
ors
anton
hadn
t
you
better
wait
for
my
uncle
he
must
be
here
soon
and
with
him
you
would
be
don
t
be
frightened
chili
i
don
t
need
your
if
you
would
let
me
i
would
go
in
front
of
no
thanks
no
thanks
and
orso
spurring
his
horse
rode
rapidly
in
the
direction
to
which
the
little
girl
had
pointed
his
first
impulse
had
been
one
of
blind
fury
and
he
had
told
himself
that
fortune
was
offering
him
an
excellent
opportunity
of
punishing
the
coward
who
had
avenged
the
blow
he
had
received
by
mutilating
a
horse
but
as
he
moved
onward
the
thought
of
his
promise
to
the
prefect
and
above
all
his
fear
of
missing
miss
nevil
s
visit
altered
his
feelings
and
made
him
almost
wish
he
might
not
come
upon
orlanduccio
soon
however
the
memory
of
his
father
the
indignity
offered
to
his
own
horse
and
the
threats
of
the
barricini
stirred
his
rage
afresh
and
incited
him
to
seek
his
foe
and
to
provoke
and
force
him
to
a
fight
thus
tossed
by
conflicting
feelings
he
continued
his
progress
though
now
he
carefully
scrutinized
every
thicket
and
hedge
and
sometimes
even
pulled
up
his
horse
to
listen
to
the
vague
sounds
to
be
heard
in
any
open
country
ten
minutes
after
he
had
left
little
chilina
it
was
then
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
found
himself
on
the
edge
of
an
exceedingly
steep
declivity
the
road
or
rather
the
very
slight
path
which
he
was
following
ran
through
a
that
had
been
lately
burned
the
ground
was
covered
with
whitish
ashes
and
here
and
there
some
shrubs
and
a
few
big
trees
blackened
by
the
flames
and
entirely
stripped
of
their
leaves
still
stood
erect
though
life
had
long
since
departed
out
of
them
the
sight
of
a
burned
is
enough
to
make
a
man
fancy
he
has
been
transported
into
midwinter
in
some
northern
clime
and
the
contrast
between
the
barrenness
of
the
ground
over
which
the
flames
have
passed
with
the
luxuriant
vegetation
round
about
it
heightens
this
appearance
of
sadness
and
desolation
but
at
that
moment
the
only
thing
that
struck
orso
in
this
particular
landscape
was
one
point
an
important
one
it
is
true
in
his
present
circumstances
the
bareness
of
the
ground
rendered
any
kind
of
ambush
impossible
and
the
man
who
has
reason
to
fear
that
at
any
moment
he
may
see
a
thrust
out
of
a
thicket
straight
at
his
own
chest
looks
on
a
stretch
of
smooth
ground
with
nothing
on
it
to
intercept
his
view
as
a
kind
of
oasis
after
this
burned
came
a
number
of
cultivated
fields
inclosed
according
to
the
fashion
of
that
country
with
walls
built
of
dry
stones
the
path
ran
between
these
fields
producing
from
a
distance
the
effect
of
a
thick
wood
the
steepness
of
the
declivity
made
it
necessary
for
orso
to
dismount
he
was
walking
quickly
down
the
hill
which
was
slippery
with
ashes
he
had
thrown
the
bridle
on
his
horse
s
neck
and
was
hardly
paces
from
one
of
these
stone
fences
when
just
in
front
of
him
on
the
side
of
the
road
he
perceived
first
of
all
the
barrel
of
a
gun
and
then
a
head
rising
over
the
top
of
the
wall
the
gun
was
levelled
and
he
recognised
orlanduccio
just
ready
to
fire
orso
swiftly
prepared
for
and
the
two
men
taking
deliberate
aim
stared
at
each
other
for
several
seconds
with
that
thrill
of
emotion
which
the
bravest
must
feel
when
he
knows
he
must
either
deal
death
or
endure
it
vile
coward
shouted
orso
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
he
saw
the
flash
of
orlanduccio
s
gun
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
second
shot
rang
out
on
his
left
from
the
other
side
of
the
path
fired
by
a
man
whom
he
had
not
noticed
and
who
was
aiming
at
him
from
behind
another
wall
both
bullets
struck
him
the
first
orlanduccio
s
passed
through
his
left
arm
which
orso
had
turned
toward
him
as
he
aimed
the
second
shot
struck
him
in
the
chest
and
tore
his
coat
but
coming
in
contact
with
the
blade
of
his
dagger
it
luckily
flattened
against
it
and
only
inflicted
a
trifling
bruise
orso
s
left
arm
fell
helpless
at
his
side
and
the
barrel
of
his
gun
dropped
for
a
moment
but
he
raised
it
at
once
and
aiming
his
weapon
with
his
right
hand
only
he
fired
at
orlanduccio
his
enemy
s
head
which
was
only
exposed
to
the
level
of
the
eyes
disappeared
behind
the
wall
then
orso
swinging
round
to
the
left
fired
the
second
barrel
at
a
man
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
whom
he
could
hardly
see
this
face
likewise
disappeared
the
four
shots
had
followed
each
other
with
incredible
swiftness
no
trained
soldiers
ever
fired
their
volleys
in
quicker
succession
after
orso
s
last
shot
a
great
silence
fell
the
smoke
from
his
weapon
rose
slowly
up
into
the
sky
there
was
not
a
movement
not
the
slightest
sound
from
behind
the
wall
but
for
the
pain
in
his
arm
he
could
have
fancied
the
men
on
whom
he
had
just
fired
had
been
phantoms
of
his
own
imagination
fully
expecting
a
second
volley
orso
moved
a
few
steps
to
place
himself
behind
one
of
the
burned
trees
that
still
stood
upright
in
the
thus
sheltered
he
put
his
gun
between
his
knees
and
hurriedly
reloaded
it
meanwhile
his
left
arm
began
to
hurt
him
horribly
and
felt
as
if
it
were
being
dragged
down
by
a
huge
weight
what
had
become
of
his
adversaries
he
could
not
understand
if
they
had
taken
to
flight
if
they
had
been
wounded
he
would
certainly
have
heard
some
noise
some
stir
among
the
leaves
were
they
dead
then
or
what
was
far
more
likely
were
they
not
waiting
behind
their
wall
for
a
chance
of
shooting
at
him
again
in
his
uncertainty
and
feeling
his
strength
fast
failing
him
he
knelt
down
on
his
right
knee
rested
his
wounded
arm
upon
the
other
and
took
advantage
of
a
branch
that
protruded
from
the
trunk
of
the
burned
tree
to
support
his
gun
with
his
finger
on
the
trigger
his
eye
fixed
on
the
wall
and
his
ear
strained
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
he
knelt
there
motionless
for
several
minutes
which
seemed
to
him
a
century
at
last
behind
him
in
the
far
distance
he
heard
a
faint
shout
and
very
soon
a
dog
flew
like
an
arrow
down
the
slope
and
stopped
short
close
to
him
wagging
its
tail
it
was
brusco
the
comrade
and
follower
of
the
bandits
the
herald
doubtless
of
his
master
s
approach
never
was
any
honest
man
more
impatiently
awaited
with
his
muzzle
in
the
air
and
turned
toward
the
nearest
fence
the
dog
sniffed
anxiously
suddenly
he
gave
vent
to
a
low
growl
sprang
at
a
bound
over
the
wall
and
almost
instantly
reappeared
upon
its
crest
whence
he
gazed
steadily
at
orso
with
eyes
that
spoke
surprise
as
clearly
as
a
dog
s
may
do
it
then
he
sniffed
again
this
time
toward
the
other
inclosure
the
wall
of
which
he
also
crossed
within
a
second
he
was
back
on
the
top
of
that
with
the
same
air
of
astonishment
and
alarm
and
straightway
he
bounded
into
the
thicket
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
still
gazing
at
orso
and
retiring
from
him
slowly
and
sideways
until
he
had
put
some
distance
between
them
then
off
he
started
again
tearing
up
the
slope
almost
as
fast
as
he
had
come
down
it
to
meet
a
man
who
in
spite
of
its
steepness
was
rapidly
descending
help
brando
shouted
orso
as
soon
as
he
thought
he
was
within
hearing
hallo

ran
up
panting

and
the
other
fellow
i

hit
brandolaccio
ran
after
the
dog
to
the
nearest
field
and
leaned
over
to
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
wall
then
pulling
off
his
cap
signor
orlanduccio
i
salute

said
he
then
turning
toward
orso
he
bowed
to
him
also
gravely
that
he
remarked

what
i
call
a
man
who
has
been
properly
done
is
he
still
alive
asked
orso
who
could
hardly

too
much
vexed
about
the
bullet
you

into
his
eye

the

to

utterly

the
good
point

is
that
you

just
come
over
and
look
at
vincentello
he
s
kneeling
here
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
if
he
were
asleep
you
may
say
he
sleeps
like

in

just
where

from

two
gendarmes
as
he
talked
the
bandit
was
scanning
orso

arm
and
splitting
up
his
sleeve
with
his
dagger

again
he
broke
off
the
dressing
of
the
wound
to
exclaim
a

and
left
both
of
them
stone
dead
how
the

onto

wall
and

moment

caught

a

on
you
you

for

was
superstitious
like
most
bandits
feared
he
might
cast
a
spell
on
a
child
if
he
blessed
it
or
praised
it
seeing
it
is
a
fact
that
the
mysterious
powers
that
rule
the
have
a
vile
habit
of
fulfilling
our
wishes
in
the
very
opposite
sense
to
that
we
give
them
an
involuntary
spell
cast
either
by

chapter
xviii
meanwhile
very
shortly
after
orso
s
departure
colomba
s
spies
had
warned
her
that
the
barricini
were
out
on
the
warpath
and
from
that
moment
she
was
racked
by
the
most
intense
anxiety
she
was
to
be
seen
moving
hither
and
thither
all
over
the
house
between
the
kitchen
and
the
rooms
that
were
being
made
ready
for
her
guests
doing
nothing
yet
always
busy
and
constantly
stopping
to
look
out
of
a
window
for
any
unusual
stir
in
the
village
toward
eleven
o
clock
a
somewhat
numerous
cavalcade
rode
into
pietranera
this
was
the
colonel
with
his
daughter
their
servants
and
their
guide
colomba
s
first
word
as
she
welcomed
them
was
have
you
seen
my
brother
then
she
questioned
the
guide
as
to
the
road
they
had
taken
and
the
hour
of
their
departure
and
having
heard
his
answers
she
could
not
understand
why
they
had
not
met
him
perhaps
said
the
guide
your
brother
took
the
higher
path
we
came
by
the
lower
but
colomba
only
shook
her
head
and
asked
more
questions
in
spite
of
her
natural
firmness
of
character
increased
as
it
was
by
her
proud
desire
to
conceal
any
sign
of
weakness
before
strangers
she
could
not
hide
her
anxiety
and
as
soon
as
she
had
informed
them
of
the
attempted
reconciliation
and
of
its
unfortunate
issue
this
was
shared
by
the
colonel
and
miss
lydia
miss
nevil
became
very
uneasy
and
wanted
to
have
messengers
sent
off
in
every
direction
and
her
father
offered
to
remount
at
once
and
set
out
with
the
guide
in
search
of
orso
her
guests
alarm
recalled
colomba
to
a
sense
of
her
duties
as
a
hostess
she
strove
to
force
a
smile
as
she
pressed
the
colonel
to
come
to
table
and
suggested
twenty
plausible
reasons
which
she
herself
demolished
within
an
instant
to
account
for
her
brother
s
delay
the
colonel
feeling
it
to
be
his
duty
as
a
man
to
reassure
the
ladies
put
forward
his
own
explanation
i
ll
wager
he
said
that
della
rebbia
has
come
across
some
game
or
other
he
has
not
been
able
to
stand
out
against
that
temptation
and
we
shall
soon
see
him
come
in
with
a
heavy
bag
pon
my
soul
he
went
on
we
did
hear
four
shots
fired
on
the
road
two
of
them
were
louder
than
the
others
and
i
said
to
my
girl
i
ll
bet
anything
that
s
della
rebbia
out
shooting
my
gun
is
the
only
one
that
would
make
that
colomba
turned
pale
and
lydia
who
was
watching
her
closely
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
the
suspicions
with
which
the
colonel
s
conjecture
had
inspired
her
after
a
few
minutes
silence
colomba
eagerly
inquired
whether
the
two
louder
reports
had
been
heard
before
or
after
the
others
but
neither
the
colonel
his
daughter
nor
the
guide
had
paid
much
attention
to
this
detail
toward
one
o
clock
as
none
of
colomba
s
messengers
had
yet
returned
she
gathered
all
her
courage
and
insisted
that
her
guests
should
sit
down
to
table
with
her
but
except
the
colonel
none
of
them
could
eat
at
the
slightest
sound
in
the
square
colomba
ran
to
the
window
then
drearily
she
returned
to
her
place
and
struggled
yet
more
drearily
to
carry
on
a
trivial
conversation
to
which
nobody
paid
the
slightest
attention
and
which
was
broken
by
long
intervals
of
silence
all
at
once
they
heard
a
horse
s
gallop
ah
that
must
be
my
brother
at
last
said
colomba
rising
from
her
chair
but
when
she
saw
chilina
astride
on
orso
s
horse
my
brother
is
dead
she
cried
in
a
voice
the
colonel
dropped
his
glass
miss
lydia
screamed
they
all
rushed
to
the
door
of
the
house
before
chilina
could
jump
off
her
steed
she
was
snatched
up
like
a
feather
by
colomba
who
held
her
so
tight
that
she
almost
choked
her
the
child
understood
her
agonized
look
and
her
first
words
were
those
of
the
chorus
in
othello
he
lives
colomba
s
grasp
relaxed
and
nimbly
as
a
kitten
chilina
dropped
upon
the
ground
the
others
queried
colomba
hoarsely
chilina
crossed
herself
with
her
first
and
middle
finger
a
deep
flush
instantly
replaced
the
deadly
pallor
of
colomba
s
face
she
cast
one
fierce
look
at
the
barricini
dwelling
and
then
with
a
smile
she
turned
to
her
guests
let
us
go
in
and
drink
our
coffee
she
said
the
story
the
bandit
s
iris
had
to
tell
was
a
long
one
her
narrative
translated
literally
into
italian
by
colomba
and
then
into
english
by
miss
nevil
wrung
more
than
one
oath
from
the
colonel
more
than
one
sigh
from
the
fair
lydia
but
colomba
heard
it
all
unmoved
only
she
twisted
her
damask
napkin
till
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
tear
it
in
pieces
she
interrupted
the
child
five
or
six
times
over
to
make
her
repeat
again
that
brandolaccio
had
said
the
wound
was
not
dangerous
and
that
he
had
seen
many
worse
when
she
had
finished
her
tale
chilina
announced
that
orso
earnestly
begged
he
might
be
sent
writing
materials
and
that
he
desired
his
sister
would
beseech
a
lady
who
might
be
staying
in
his
house
not
to
depart
from
it
until
she
had
received
a
letter
from
him
that
is
what
was
worrying
him
most
the
child
added
and
even
after
i
had
started
he
called
me
back
to
bid
me
not
forget
the
message
it
was
the
third
time
he
had
given
it
to
when
colomba
heard
of
her
brother
s
injunction
she
smiled
faintly
and
squeezed
the
fair
englishwoman
s
hand
that
young
lady
burst
into
tears
and
did
not
seem
to
think
it
advisable
to
translate
that
particular
part
of
the
story
to
her
father
yes
my
dear
cried
colomba
kissing
miss
nevil
you
shall
stay
with
me
and
you
shall
help
then
taking
a
pile
of
old
linen
out
of
a
cupboard
she
began
to
cut
it
up
to
make
lint
and
bandages
any
one
who
saw
her
flashing
eyes
her
heightened
colour
her
alternate
fits
of
anxiety
and
composure
would
have
found
it
hard
to
say
whether
distress
at
her
brother
s
wound
or
delight
at
the
extinction
of
her
foes
were
most
affecting
her
one
moment
she
was
pouring
out
the
colonel
s
coffee
and
telling
him
how
well
she
made
it
the
next
she
was
setting
miss
lydia
and
chilina
to
work
exhorting
them
to
sew
bandages
and
roll
them
up
then
for
the
twentieth
time
she
would
ask
whether
orso
s
wound
was
very
painful
she
constantly
broke
off
her
own
work
to
exclaim
to
the
colonel
two
such
cunning
men
such
dangerous
fellows
and
he
alone
wounded
with
only
one
arm
he
killed
the
two
of
them
what
courage
colonel
isn
t
he
a
hero
ah
miss
nevil
how
good
it
is
to
live
in
a
peaceful
country
like
yours
i
m
sure
you
did
not
really
know
my
brother
till
now
i
said
it
the
falcon
will
spread
his
wings
you
were
deceived
by
his
gentle
look
that
s
because
with
you
miss
nevil
ah
if
he
could
see
you
working
for
him
now
my
poor
orso
miss
lydia
was
doing
hardly
any
work
and
could
not
find
a
single
word
to
say
her
father
kept
asking
why
nobody
went
to
lay
a
complaint
before
a
magistrate
he
talked
about
a
coroner
s
inquest
and
all
sorts
of
other
proceedings
quite
unknown
to
corsican
economy
and
then
he
begged
to
be
told
whether
the
country
house
owned
by
that
worthy
signor
brandolaccio
who
had
brought
succour
to
the
wounded
man
was
very
far
away
from
pietranera
and
whether
he
could
not
go
there
himself
to
see
his
friend
and
colomba
replied
with
her
usual
composure
that
orso
was
in
the
that
he
was
being
taken
care
of
by
a
bandit
that
it
would
be
a
great
risk
for
him
to
show
himself
until
he
was
sure
of
the
line
the
prefect
and
the
judges
were
likely
to
take
and
finally
that
she
would
manage
to
have
him
secretly
attended
by
a
skilful
surgeon
above
all
things
colonel
she
added
remember
that
you
heard
the
four
shots
and
that
you
told
me
orso
fired
the
colonel
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
business
and
his
daughter
did
nothing
but
heave
sighs
and
dry
her
eyes
the
day
was
far
advanced
when
a
gloomy
procession
wended
its
way
into
the
village
the
bodies
of
his
two
sons
were
brought
home
to
lawyer
barricini
each
corpse
thrown
across
a
mule
which
was
led
by
a
peasant
a
crowd
of
dependents
and
idlers
followed
the
dreary
with
it
appeared
the
gendarmes
who
always
came
in
too
late
and
the
throwing
up
his
hands
and
incessantly
repeating
what
will
signor
prefetto
say
some
of
the
women
among
them
orlanduccio
s
were
tearing
their
hair
and
shrieking
wildly
but
their
clamorous
grief
was
less
impressive
than
the
dumb
despair
of
one
man
on
whom
all
eyes
were
fixed
this
was
the
wretched
father
who
passed
from
one
corpse
to
the
other
lifting
up
the
heads
kissing
the
blackened
lips
supporting
the
limbs
that
were
stiff
already
as
if
he
would
save
them
from
the
jolting
of
the
road
now
and
then
he
opened
his
mouth
as
though
about
to
speak
but
not
a
cry
came
not
a
word
his
eyes
never
left
the
dead
bodies
and
as
he
walked
he
knocked
himself
against
the
stones
against
the
trees
against
every
obstacle
that
chanced
to
lie
in
his
path
the
women
s
lamentations
grew
louder
and
the
men
s
curses
deeper
when
orso
s
house
appeared
in
sight
when
some
shepherds
of
the
della
rebbia
party
ventured
on
a
triumphant
shout
their
enemy
s
indignation
became
ungovernable
vengeance
vengeance
exclaimed
several
voices
stones
were
thrown
and
two
shots
fired
at
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
colomba
and
her
guests
were
sitting
pierced
the
outside
shutters
and
carried
splinters
of
wood
on
to
the
table
at
which
the
two
ladies
were
working
miss
lydia
screamed
violently
the
colonel
snatched
up
a
gun
and
colomba
before
he
could
stop
her
rushed
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
threw
it
violently
open
there
standing
high
on
the
threshold
with
her
two
hands
outstretched
to
curse
her
enemies
cowards
she
cried
you
fire
on
women
and
on
foreigners
are
you
corsicans
are
you
men
wretches
who
can
only
murder
a
man
from
behind
come
on
i
defy
you
i
am
alone
my
brother
is
far
away
come
kill
me
kill
my
guests
it
would
be
worthy
of
you
but
you
dare
not
cowards
that
you
are
you
know
we
avenge
our
wrongs
away
with
you
go
weep
like
women
and
be
thankful
we
do
not
ask
you
for
more
blood
there
was
something
terrible
and
imposing
in
colomba
s
voice
and
mien
at
the
sight
of
her
the
crowd
recoiled
as
though
it
beheld
one
of
those
evil
fairies
of
which
so
many
tales
are
told
on
long
winter
evenings
in
corsica
the
the
gendarmes
and
a
few
women
seized
the
opportunity
and
threw
themselves
between
the
two
factions
for
the
della
rebbia
herdsmen
were
already
loading
their
guns
and
for
a
moment
a
general
fight
in
the
middle
of
the
square
had
appeared
imminent
but
the
two
parties
were
both
leaderless
and
corsicans
whose
rage
is
always
subject
to
discipline
seldom
come
to
blows
unless
the
chief
authors
of
their
internecine
quarrels
are
present
besides
colomba
who
had
learned
prudence
from
victory
restrained
her
little
garrison
let
the
poor
folks
weep
in
peace
she
said
let
the
old
man
carry
his
own
flesh
home
what
is
the
good
of
killing
an
old
fox
who
has
no
teeth
left
to
bite
with
giudice
barricini
remember
the
of
august
remember
the
in
which
you
wrote
with
your
forger
s
hand
my
father
had
written
down
your
debt
your
sons
have
paid
it
you
may
go
free
old
barricini
with
folded
arms
and
a
scornful
smile
upon
her
lips
colomba
watched
the
bearers
carry
the
corpses
of
her
enemies
into
their
home
and
the
crowd
without
it
melt
gradually
away
then
she
closed
her
own
door
and
going
back
into
the
she
said
to
the
colonel
i
beg
sir
you
will
forgive
my
i
never
could
have
believed
that
any
corsican
would
have
fired
on
a
house
that
sheltered
strangers
and
i
am
ashamed
of
my
that
night
when
miss
lydia
had
gone
up
to
her
room
the
colonel
followed
her
and
inquired
whether
they
had
not
better
get
out
of
a
village
where
they
ran
incessant
risk
of
having
a
bullet
through
their
heads
the
very
next
morning
and
leave
this
country
seething
with
treachery
and
murder
as
soon
as
possible
miss
nevil
did
not
answer
for
some
time
and
her
father
s
suggestion
evidently
caused
her
considerable
perplexity
at
last
she
said
how
can
we
leave
this
poor
young
creature
just
when
she
is
so
much
in
need
of
consolation
don
t
you
think
that
would
be
cruel
father
i
only
spoke
on
your
account
child
said
the
colonel
and
i
assure
you
that
if
i
once
felt
you
were
safe
in
the
hotel
at
ajaccio
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
leave
this
cursed
island
myself
without
shaking
that
plucky
fellow
della
rebbia
s
hand
well
then
father
let
us
wait
a
while
and
before
we
start
let
us
make
quite
sure
we
can
not
be
of
any
use
to
kind
soul
said
the
colonel
as
he
kissed
his
daughter
s
forehead
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
the
sake
of
softening
other
people
s
suffering
let
us
stay
on
we
shall
never
have
to
repent
having
done
miss
lydia
tossed
sleeplessly
to
and
fro
in
her
bed
sometimes
she
took
the
vague
night
sounds
for
preparations
for
an
attack
on
the
house
sometimes
less
alarmed
on
her
own
account
she
thought
of
poor
wounded
orso
who
was
probably
lying
on
the
cold
earth
with
no
help
beyond
what
she
might
expect
from
a
bandit
s
charity
she
fancied
him
covered
with
blood
and
writhing
in
hideous
suffering
and
the
extraordinary
thing
was
that
whenever
orso
s
image
rose
up
before
her
mind
s
eye
she
always
beheld
him
as
she
had
seen
him
when
he
rode
away
pressing
the
talisman
she
had
bestowed
upon
him
to
his
lips
then
she
mused
over
his
courage
she
told
herself
he
had
exposed
himself
to
the
frightful
danger
he
had
just
escaped
on
her
account
just
for
the
sake
of
seeing
her
a
little
sooner
a
very
little
more
and
she
would
have
persuaded
herself
that
orso
had
earned
his
broken
arm
in
her
defence
she
reproached
herself
with
being
the
cause
of
his
wound
but
she
admired
him
for
it
all
the
more
and
if
that
celebrated
right
and
left
was
not
so
splendid
a
feat
in
her
sight
as
in
brandolaccio
s
or
colomba
s
still
she
was
convinced
few
heroes
of
romance
could
ever
had
behaved
with
such
intrepidity
and
coolness
in
so
dangerous
a
pinch
her
room
was
that
usually
occupied
by
colomba
above
a
kind
of
oaken
and
beside
a
sprig
of
blessed
palm
a
little
miniature
of
orso
in
his
s
uniform
hung
on
the
wall
miss
nevil
took
the
portrait
down
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
and
laid
it
at
last
on
the
table
by
her
bed
instead
of
hanging
it
up
again
in
its
place
she
did
not
fall
asleep
till
daybreak
and
when
she
woke
the
sun
had
travelled
high
above
the
horizon
in
front
of
her
bed
she
beheld
colomba
waiting
motionless
till
she
should
open
her
eyes
well
dear
lady
are
you
not
very
uncomfortable
in
this
poor
house
of
ours
said
colomba
to
her
i
fear
you
have
hardly
slept
at
have
you
any
news
dear
friend
cried
miss
nevil
sitting
up
in
bed
her
eye
fell
on
orso
s
picture
and
she
hastily
tossed
her
handkerchief
upon
it
yes
i
have
news
said
colomba
with
a
smile
then
she
took
up
the
picture
do
you
think
it
like
him
he
is
better
looking
than
that
really
stammered
miss
nevil
quite
confused
i
took
down
that
picture
in
a
fit
of
absence
i
have
a
horrid
habit
of
touching
everything
and
never
putting
anything
back
how
is
your
brother
fairly
well
giocanto
came
here
before
four
o
clock
this
morning
he
brought
me
a
letter
for
you
miss
lydia
orso
hasn
t
written
anything
to
me
it
is
addressed
to
colomba
indeed
but
underneath
that
he
has
written
for
miss
but
sisters
are
never
jealous
giocanto
says
it
hurt
him
dreadfully
to
write
giocanto
who
writes
a
splendid
hand
offered
to
do
it
at
his
dictation
but
he
would
not
let
him
he
wrote
it
with
a
pencil
lying
on
his
back
brandolaccio
held
the
paper
for
him
my
brother
kept
trying
to
raise
himself
and
then
the
very
slightest
movement
gave
him
the
most
dreadful
agony
in
his
arm
giocanto
says
it
was
pitiful
here
is
his
miss
nevil
read
the
letter
which
as
an
extra
precaution
no
doubt
was
written
in
english
its
contents
were
as
follows
mademoiselle
an
unhappy
fate
has
driven
me
on
i
know
not
what
my
enemies
will
say
what
slanders
they
will
invent
i
care
little
so
long
as
you
mademoiselle
give
them
no
credence
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
i
have
been
nursing
wild
dreams
i
needed
this
catastrophe
to
show
me
my
own
folly
i
have
come
back
to
my
senses
now
i
know
the
future
that
lies
before
me
and
i
shall
face
it
with
resignation
i
dare
not
keep
this
ring
you
gave
me
and
which
i
believed
to
be
a
lucky
talisman
i
fear
miss
nevil
you
may
regret
your
gift
has
been
so
or
rather
i
fear
it
may
remind
me
of
the
days
of
my
own
madness
colomba
will
give
it
to
you
farewell
mademoiselle
you
are
about
to
leave
corsica
and
i
shall
never
see
you
again
but
tell
my
sister
at
least
that
i
still
possess
your
esteem
and
i
tell
you
confidently
that
i
am
still
worthy
of
it
miss
lydia
had
turned
away
while
she
read
the
letter
and
colomba
who
was
watching
her
closely
gave
her
the
egyptian
ring
with
an
inquiring
glance
as
to
what
it
all
meant
but
miss
lydia
dared
not
raise
her
head
and
looked
dejectedly
at
the
ring
alternately
putting
it
on
her
finger
and
pulling
it
off
again
dear
miss
nevil
said
colomba
may
i
not
know
what
my
brother
says
to
you
does
he
say
anything
about
his
health
indeed
said
miss
lydia
colouring
he
doesn
t
mention
it
his
letter
is
in
english
he
desires
me
to
tell
my
father
he
hopes
the
prefect
will
be
able
to
arrange
with
a
mischievous
smile
colomba
sat
down
on
the
bed
took
hold
of
both
miss
nevil
s
hands
and
looking
at
her
with
her
piercing
eyes
will
you
be
kind
she
said
won
t
you
answer
my
brother
s
letter
you
would
do
him
so
much
good
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
waking
you
when
his
letter
came
and
then
i
didn
t
dare
you
did
very
wrong
replied
miss
nevil
if
a
word
from
me
could
i
can
t
send
him
any
letter
now
the
prefect
has
arrived
and
pietranera
is
full
of
his
policemen
later
on
we
ll
see
what
we
can
do
oh
miss
nevil
if
you
only
knew
my
brother
you
would
love
him
as
dearly
as
i
do
he
s
so
good
he
s
so
brave
just
think
of
what
he
has
done
one
man
against
two
and
wounded
as
well
the
prefect
had
returned
warned
by
an
express
messenger
sent
by
the
he
had
brought
over
the
public
prosecutor
the
registrar
and
all
their
myrmidons
to
investigate
the
fresh
and
terrible
catastrophe
which
had
just
complicated
or
it
may
be
ended
the
warfare
between
the
chief
families
of
pietranera
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
saw
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
and
did
not
conceal
his
fear
that
the
business
might
take
on
an
ugly
aspect
you
know
he
said
that
the
fight
took
place
without
witnesses
and
the
reputation
of
these
two
unhappy
men
stood
so
high
both
for
bravery
and
cunning
that
nobody
will
believe
signor
della
rebbia
can
have
killed
them
without
the
help
of
the
bandits
with
whom
he
is
now
supposed
to
have
taken
it
s
not
possible
said
the
colonel
orso
della
rebbia
is
a
most
honourable
fellow
i
ll
stake
my
life
on
i
believe
you
said
the
prefect
but
the
public
prosecutor
those
gentry
always
are
suspicious
does
not
strike
me
as
being
particularly
well
disposed
toward
him
he
holds
one
bit
of
evidence
which
goes
rather
against
our
friend
a
threatening
letter
to
orlanduccio
in
which
he
suggests
a
meeting
and
is
inclined
to
think
that
meeting
was
a
that
fellow
orlanduccio
refused
to
fight
it
out
like
a
that
is
not
the
custom
here
in
this
country
people
lie
in
ambush
and
kill
each
other
from
behind
there
is
one
deposition
in
his
favour
that
of
a
child
who
declares
she
heard
four
reports
two
of
which
were
louder
than
the
others
and
produced
by
a
heavy
weapon
such
as
signor
della
rebbia
s
gun
unluckily
the
child
is
the
niece
of
one
of
the
bandits
suspected
of
being
his
accomplices
and
has
probably
been
taught
her
sir
broke
in
miss
lydia
reddening
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
we
were
on
the
road
when
those
shots
were
fired
and
we
heard
the
same
really
that
s
most
important
and
you
colonel
no
doubt
you
remarked
the
very
same
thing
yes
responded
miss
lydia
quickly
it
was
my
father
who
is
so
accustomed
to
firearms
who
said
to
me
there
s
signor
della
rebbia
shooting
with
my
gun
and
you
are
sure
those
shots
you
recognised
were
the
last
the
two
last
weren
t
they
papa
memory
was
not
the
colonel
s
strong
point
but
as
a
standing
rule
he
knew
better
than
to
contradict
his
daughter
i
must
mention
this
to
the
public
prosecutor
at
once
colonel
and
besides
we
expect
a
surgeon
this
evening
who
will
make
an
examination
of
the
two
bodies
and
find
out
whether
the
wounds
were
caused
by
that
particular
i
gave
it
to
orso
said
the
colonel
and
i
wish
i
knew
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
at
least
plucky
boy
i
m
heartily
glad
he
had
it
with
him
for
i
don
t
quite
know
how
he
would
have
got
off
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
my
chapter
xix
it
was
rather
late
when
the
surgeon
put
in
an
appearance
on
his
road
up
he
had
met
with
an
adventure
of
his
own
he
had
been
stopped
by
giocanto
castriconi
who
with
the
most
scrupulous
politeness
called
on
him
to
come
and
attend
a
wounded
man
he
had
been
conducted
to
orso
s
retreat
and
had
applied
the
first
dressings
to
his
wound
the
bandit
had
then
accompanied
the
doctor
some
distance
on
his
way
and
had
greatly
edified
him
by
his
talk
concerning
the
most
celebrated
professors
at
pisa
whom
he
described
as
his
intimate
friends
doctor
said
the
theologian
as
they
parted
you
have
inspired
me
with
such
a
feeling
of
respect
that
i
think
it
hardly
necessary
to
remind
you
that
a
physician
should
be
as
discreet
as
a
and
as
he
said
the
words
he
clicked
the
trigger
of
his
gun
you
have
quite
forgotten
the
spot
at
which
we
have
had
the
honour
of
meeting
fare
you
well
i
m
delighted
to
have
made
your
colomba
besought
the
colonel
to
be
present
at
the
examination
you
know
my
brother
s
gun
better
than
anybody
she
said
and
your
presence
will
be
most
valuable
besides
there
are
so
many
wicked
people
here
that
we
should
run
a
great
risk
if
there
were
nobody
present
to
protect
our
when
she
was
left
alone
with
miss
lydia
she
complained
that
her
head
ached
terribly
and
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
walk
just
outside
the
village
the
fresh
air
will
do
me
good
she
said
it
is
so
long
since
i
ve
been
out
of
as
they
walked
along
she
talked
about
her
brother
and
miss
lydia
who
found
the
subject
tolerably
interesting
did
not
notice
that
they
had
travelled
a
long
way
from
pietranera
the
sun
was
setting
when
she
became
aware
of
this
fact
and
she
begged
colomba
to
return
colomba
said
she
knew
a
which
would
greatly
shorten
the
walk
back
and
turning
out
of
the
path
she
took
another
which
seemed
much
less
frequented
soon
she
began
to
climb
a
hill
so
steep
that
to
keep
her
balance
she
was
continually
obliged
to
catch
hold
of
branches
with
one
hand
while
she
pulled
her
companion
up
after
her
with
the
other
after
about
twenty
minutes
of
this
trying
ascent
they
found
themselves
on
a
small
plateau
clothed
with
arbutus
and
myrtle
growing
round
great
granite
boulders
that
jutted
above
the
soil
in
every
direction
miss
lydia
was
very
tired
there
was
no
sign
of
the
village
and
it
was
almost
quite
dark
do
you
know
colomba
my
dear
she
said
i
m
afraid
we
ve
lost
our
way
no
fear
answered
colomba
let
us
get
on
you
follow
but
i
assure
you
we
re
going
wrong
the
village
can
t
be
over
there
i
m
certain
we
re
turning
our
backs
on
it
why
look
at
those
lights
far
away
pietranera
must
be
in
that
my
dear
soul
said
colomba
and
she
looked
very
much
agitated
you
re
perfectly
right
but
in
the
less
than
a
hundred
yards
from
here
well
my
brother
is
lying
if
you
choose
i
might
see
him
and
give
him
one
miss
nevil
made
a
gesture
of
astonishment
i
got
out
of
pietranera
without
being
noticed
continued
colomba
because
i
was
with
you
otherwise
i
should
have
been
followed
to
be
so
close
to
him
and
not
to
see
him
why
shouldn
t
you
come
with
me
to
see
my
poor
brother
you
would
make
him
so
happy
but
colomba
that
wouldn
t
be
at
all
proper
on
my
part
i
see
with
you
women
who
live
in
towns
your
great
anxiety
is
to
be
proper
we
village
women
only
think
of
what
is
but
it
s
so
late
and
then
what
will
your
brother
think
of
me
he
ll
think
his
friends
have
not
forsaken
him
and
that
will
give
him
courage
to
bear
his
and
my
father
he
ll
be
so
anxious
he
knows
you
are
with
me
come
make
up
your
mind
you
were
looking
at
his
picture
this
morning
she
added
with
a
sly
smile
no
really
and
truly
i
don
t
dare
colomba
think
of
the
bandits
who
are
well
what
matter
the
bandits
don
t
know
you
and
you
were
longing
to
see
oh
dear
come
signorina
settle
something
i
can
t
leave
you
alone
here
i
don
t
know
what
might
happen
to
you
let
us
go
on
to
see
orso
or
else
let
us
go
back
to
the
village
together
i
shall
see
my
brother
again
god
knows
when
never
perhaps
what
s
that
you
are
saying
colomba
well
well
let
us
go
but
only
for
a
minute
and
then
we
ll
get
home
at
colomba
squeezed
her
hand
and
without
making
any
reply
walked
on
so
quickly
that
miss
lydia
could
hardly
keep
up
with
her
she
soon
halted
luckily
and
said
to
her
companion
we
won
t
go
any
farther
without
warning
them
we
might
have
a
bullet
flying
at
our
she
began
to
whistle
through
her
fingers
soon
they
heard
a
dog
bark
and
the
bandits
advanced
sentry
shortly
came
in
sight
this
was
our
old
acquaintance
brusco
who
recognised
colomba
at
once
and
undertook
to
be
her
guide
after
many
windings
through
the
narrow
paths
in
the
they
were
met
by
two
men
armed
to
the
teeth
is
that
you
brandolaccio
inquired
colomba
where
is
my
brother
just
over
there
replied
the
bandit
but
go
quietly
he
s
asleep
and
for
the
first
time
since
his
accident
zounds
it
s
clear
that
where
the
devil
gets
through
a
woman
will
get
through
too
the
two
girls
moved
forward
cautiously
and
beside
a
fire
the
blaze
of
which
was
carefully
concealed
by
a
little
wall
of
stones
built
round
it
they
beheld
orso
lying
on
a
pile
of
heather
and
covered
with
a
he
was
very
pale
and
they
could
hear
his
laboured
breathing
colomba
sat
down
near
him
and
gazed
at
him
silently
with
her
hands
clasped
as
though
she
were
praying
in
her
heart
miss
lydia
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
nestled
close
against
her
friend
but
every
now
and
then
she
lifted
her
head
to
take
a
look
at
the
wounded
man
over
colomba
s
shoulder
thus
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
by
without
a
word
being
said
by
anybody
at
a
sign
from
the
theologian
brandolaccio
had
plunged
with
him
into
the
to
the
great
relief
of
miss
lydia
who
for
the
first
time
fancied
the
local
colour
of
the
bandits
wild
beards
and
warlike
equipment
was
a
trifle
too
strong
at
last
orso
stirred
instantly
colomba
bent
over
him
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
pouring
out
questions
anent
his
wound
his
suffering
and
his
needs
after
having
answered
that
he
was
doing
as
well
as
possible
orso
inquired
in
his
turn
whether
miss
nevil
was
still
at
pietranera
and
whether
she
had
written
to
him
colomba
bending
over
her
brother
completely
hid
her
companion
from
his
sight
and
indeed
the
darkness
would
have
made
any
recognition
difficult
she
was
holding
one
of
miss
nevil
s
hands
with
the
other
she
slightly
raised
her
wounded
brother
s
head
no
brother
she
replied
she
did
not
give
me
any
letter
for
you
but
are
you
still
thinking
about
miss
nevil
you
must
love
her
very
much
love
her
colomba
but
but
now
she
may
despise
me
at
this
point
miss
nevil
made
a
struggle
to
withdraw
her
fingers
but
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
colomba
to
slacken
her
grasp
small
and
though
her
hand
was
it
possessed
a
strength
of
which
we
have
already
noticed
certain
proofs
despise
you
cried
colomba
after
what
you
ve
done
no
indeed
she
praises
you
oh
orso
i
could
tell
you
so
many
things
about
her
lydia
s
hand
was
still
struggling
for
its
freedom
but
colomba
kept
drawing
it
closer
to
orso
but
after
all
said
the
wounded
man
why
didn
t
she
answer
me
if
she
had
sent
me
a
single
line
i
should
have
been
by
dint
of
pulling
at
miss
nevil
s
hand
colomba
contrived
at
last
to
put
it
into
her
brother
s
then
moving
suddenly
aside
she
burst
out
laughing
orso
she
cried
mind
you
don
t
speak
evil
of
miss
lydia
she
understands
corsican
quite
miss
lydia
took
back
her
hand
at
once
and
stammered
some
unintelligible
words
orso
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
you
here
miss
nevil
good
heavens
how
did
you
dare
oh
how
happy
you
have
made
me
and
raising
himself
painfully
he
strove
to
get
closer
to
her
i
came
with
your
sister
said
miss
lydia
so
that
nobody
might
suspect
where
she
was
going
and
then
i
i
wanted
to
make
sure
for
myself
alas
how
uncomfortable
you
are
here
colomba
had
seated
herself
behind
orso
she
raised
him
carefully
so
that
his
head
might
rest
on
her
lap
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
signed
to
miss
lydia
to
come
near
him
closer
closer
she
said
a
sick
man
mustn
t
talk
too
and
when
miss
lydia
hesitated
she
caught
her
hand
and
forced
her
to
sit
down
so
close
to
orso
that
her
dress
touched
him
and
her
hand
still
in
colomba
s
grasp
lay
on
the
wounded
man
s
shoulder
now
he
s
very
comfortable
said
colomba
cheerily
isn
t
it
good
to
lie
out
in
the
on
such
a
lovely
night
eh
orso
how
you
must
be
suffering
exclaimed
miss
lydia
my
suffering
is
all
gone
now
said
orso
and
i
should
like
to
die
here
and
his
right
hand
crept
up
toward
miss
lydia
s
which
colomba
still
held
captive
you
really
must
be
taken
to
some
place
where
you
can
be
properly
cared
for
signor
della
rebbia
said
miss
nevil
i
shall
never
be
able
to
sleep
in
my
bed
now
that
i
have
seen
you
lying
here
so
uncomfortable
in
the
open
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
of
meeting
you
miss
nevil
i
should
have
tried
to
get
back
to
pietranera
and
i
should
have
given
myself
up
to
the
and
why
were
you
afraid
of
meeting
her
orso
inquired
colomba
i
had
disobeyed
you
miss
nevil
and
i
should
not
have
dared
to
look
at
you
just
do
you
know
you
make
my
brother
do
everything
you
choose
miss
lydia
said
colomba
laughing
i
won
t
let
you
see
him
any
i
hope
this
unlucky
business
will
soon
be
cleared
up
and
that
you
will
have
nothing
more
to
fear
said
miss
nevil
i
shall
be
so
happy
when
we
go
away
to
know
justice
has
been
done
you
and
that
both
your
loyalty
and
your
bravery
have
been
going
away
miss
nevil
don
t
say
that
word
yet
what
are
we
to
do
my
father
can
not
spend
his
whole
life
shooting
he
wants
to
orso
s
hand
which
had
been
touching
miss
lydia
s
dropped
away
and
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
nonsense
said
colomba
we
won
t
let
you
go
yet
we
have
plenty
of
things
to
show
you
still
at
pietranera
besides
you
have
promised
to
paint
my
picture
and
you
haven
t
even
begun
it
so
far
and
then
i
ve
promised
to
compose
you
a
with
verses
and
then
but
what
can
brusco
be
growling
about
and
here
s
brandolaccio
running
after
him
i
must
go
and
see
what
s
she
rose
at
once
and
laying
orso
s
head
without
further
ceremony
on
miss
lydia
s
lap
she
ran
after
the
bandits
miss
nevil
somewhat
startled
at
finding
herself
thus
left
in
sole
charge
of
a
handsome
young
corsican
gentleman
in
the
middle
of
a
was
rather
puzzled
what
to
do
next
for
she
was
afraid
that
any
sudden
movement
on
her
part
might
hurt
the
wounded
man
but
orso
himself
resigned
the
exquisite
pillow
on
which
his
sister
had
just
laid
his
head
and
raising
himself
on
his
right
arm
he
said
so
you
will
soon
be
gone
miss
lydia
i
never
expected
your
stay
in
this
unhappy
country
would
have
been
a
long
one
and
yet
since
you
have
come
to
me
here
the
thought
that
i
must
bid
you
farewell
has
grown
a
hundred
times
more
bitter
to
me
i
am
only
a
poor
lieutenant
i
had
no
future
and
now
i
am
an
outlaw
what
a
moment
in
which
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
miss
lydia
but
no
doubt
this
is
my
only
chance
of
saying
it
and
i
think
i
feel
less
wretched
now
i
have
unburdened
my
heart
to
miss
lydia
turned
away
her
head
as
if
the
darkness
were
not
dark
enough
to
hide
her
blushes
signor
della
rebbia
she
said
and
her
voice
shook
should
i
have
come
here
at
all
if
and
as
she
spoke
she
laid
the
egyptian
talisman
in
orso
s
hand
then
with
a
mighty
effort
to
recover
her
usual
bantering
tone
it
s
very
wrong
of
you
signor
orso
to
say
such
things
you
know
very
well
that
here
in
the
middle
of
the
and
with
your
bandits
all
about
me
i
should
never
dare
to
be
angry
with
orso
made
an
attempt
to
kiss
the
hand
that
held
out
the
talisman
miss
lydia
drew
it
quickly
back
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
on
his
wounded
arm
he
could
not
stifle
a
moan
of
pain
oh
dear
you
ve
hurt
yourself
and
it
was
my
fault
she
cried
as
she
raised
him
up
forgive
me
they
talked
for
some
time
longer
very
low
and
very
close
together
colomba
running
hastily
up
found
them
in
the
very
same
position
in
which
she
had
left
them
the
soldiers
she
cried
orso
try
to
get
up
and
walk
i
ll
help

me
said
orso
tell
the
bandits
to
escape
what

i
care
if
i
am
taken
but

away
miss
lydia
for
god
s
sake

t
let
anybody

brandolaccio
who
had
come
up
on
colomba
s
heels

sergeant
in
charge

the
lawyer
s
godson
he
ll
shoot
you
instead
of
arresting
you
and
then
he
ll
say
he
didn
t
do
it
on
orso
tried
to
rise
he
even
took
a
few
steps
but
he
soon
halted
i
can
t
walk
he
said
fly
all
of
you
miss
nevil
give
me
your
hand
farewell
we
won
t
leave

cried
the
two
girls
if

said
brandolaccio
i
must
carry
you
come
sir
a
little
courage
we
shall
have
time
to
slip
away
by
the
ravine
the
signor
padre
will
keep
them
no
leave
me
said
orso
lying
down
on
the
ground
colomba
take
miss
nevil
away
for
god
s
sake
you
re
strong
signorina
colomba
said
brandolaccio
catch
hold
of
his
shoulders
i
ll
take
his
feet
that
s
it
now
then
march
in
spite
of
his
protests
they
began
to
carry
him
rapidly
along
miss
lydia
was
following
them
in
a
terrible
fright
when
a
gun
was
fired
and
five
or
six
other
reports
instantly
responded
miss
lydia
screamed
and
brandolaccio
swore
an
oath
but
he
doubled
his
pace
and
colomba
imitating
him
tore
through
the
thicket
without
paying
the
slightest
heed
to
the
branches
that
slashed
her
face
and
tore
her
dress
bend
down
bend
down
dear
she
called
out
to
her
companion
you
may
be
hit
by
some
stray
bullet
they
had
walked
or
rather
run
some
five
hundred
paces
in
this
fashion
when
brandolaccio
vowed
he
could
go
no
further
and
dropped
on
the
ground
regardless
of
all
colomba
s
exhortations
and
reproaches
where
is
miss
nevil
was
orso
s
one
inquiry
terrified
by
the
firing
checked
at
every
step
by
the
thick
growth
of
the
miss
nevil
had
soon
lost
sight
of
the
fugitives
and
been
left
all
alone
in
a
state
of
the
most
cruel
alarm
she
has
been
left
behind
said
brandolaccio
but
she
ll
not
be
lost
women
always
turn
up
again
do
listen
to
the
row
the
padre
is
making
with
your
gun
ors
anton
unluckily
it
s
as
black
as
pitch
and
nobody
takes
much
harm
from
being
shot
at
in
the
hush
cried
colomba
i
hear
a
horse
we
re
saved
startled
by
the
firing
a
horse
which
had
been
wandering
through
the
was
really
coming
close
up
to
them
saved
indeed
repeated
brandolaccio
it
did
not
take
the
bandit
more
than
an
instant
to
rush
up
to
the
creature
catch
hold
of
his
mane
and
with
colomba
s
assistance
bridle
him
with
a
bit
of
knotted
rope
now
we
must
warn
the
padre
he
said
he
whistled
twice
another
distant
whistle
answered
the
signal
and
the
loud
voice
of
the
manton
gun
was
hushed
then
brandolaccio
sprang
on
the
horse
s
back
colomba
lifted
her
brother
up
in
front
of
the
bandit
who
held
him
close
with
one
hand
and
managed
his
bridle
with
the
other
in
spite
of
the
double
load
the
animal
urged
by
a
brace
of
hearty
kicks
started
off
nimbly
and
galloped
headlong
down
a
steep
declivity
on
which
anything
but
a
corsican
steed
would
have
broken
its
neck
a
dozen
times
then
colomba
retraced
her
steps
calling
miss
nevil
at
the
top
of
her
voice
but
no
answering
cry
was
heard
after
walking
hither
and
thither
for
some
time
trying
to
recover
the
path
she
stumbled
on
two
riflemen
who
shouted
who
goes
there
well
gentlemen
cried
colomba
jeeringly
here
s
a
pretty
racket
how
many
of
you
are
killed
you
were
with
the
bandits
said
one
of
the
soldiers
you
must
come
with
with
pleasure
she
replied
but
there
s
a
friend
of
mine
somewhere
close
by
and
we
must
find
her
you
friend
is
caught
already
and
both
of
you
will
sleep
in
jail
in
jail
you
say
well
that
remains
to
be
seen
but
take
me
to
her
the
soldiers
led
her
to
the
bandits
camp
where
they
had
collected
the
trophies
of
their
raid
to
wit
the
cloak
which
had
covered
orso
an
old
and
a
pitcher
of
cold
water
on
the
same
spot
she
found
miss
nevil
who
had
fallen
among
the
soldiers
and
being
half
dead
with
terror
did
nothing
but
sob
in
answer
to
their
questions
as
to
the
number
of
the
bandits
and
the
direction
in
which
they
had
gone
colomba
threw
herself
into
her
arms
and
whispered
in
her
ear
they
are
safe
then
turning
to
the
sergeant
she
said
sir
you
can
see
this
young
lady
knows
none
of
the
things
you
are
trying
to
find
out
from
her
give
us
leave
to
go
back
to
the
village
where
we
are
anxiously
you
ll
be
taken
there
and
faster
than
you
like
my
beauty
rejoined
the
sergeant
and
you
ll
have
to
explain
what
you
were
after
at
this
time
of
night
with
the
ruffians
who
have
just
got
away
i
don
t
know
what
witchcraft
those
villains
practise
but
they
certainly
do
bewitch
the
women
for
wherever
there
are
bandits
about
you
are
dead
certain
to
find
pretty
you
re
very
flattering
sergeant
said
colomba
but
you
ll
do
well
to
be
careful
what
you
say
this
young
lady
is
related
to
the
prefect
and
you
d
better
be
careful
of
your
language
before
a
relation
of
the
prefect
s
whispered
one
of
the
soldiers
to
his
chief
why
she
does
wear
a
hat
hats
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
the
sergeant
they
were
both
of
them
with
the
padre
the
greatest
in
the
whole
country
so
it
s
my
business
to
march
them
off
and
indeed
there
s
nothing
more
for
us
to
do
here
but
for
that
d
d
corporal
taupin
the
drunken
frenchman
showed
himself
before
i
d
surrounded
the
we
should
have
had
them
all
like
fish
in
a
are
there
only
seven
of
you
here
inquired
colomba
it
strikes
me
gentlemen
that
if
the
three
poli
brothers
gambini
sarocchi
and
teodoro
should
happen
to
be
at
the
cross
of
santa
christina
with
brandolaccio
and
the
padre
they
might
give
you
a
good
deal
of
corn
to
grind
if
you
mean
to
have
a
talk
with
the
commandante
della
campagna
i
d
just
as
soon
not
be
there
in
the
dark
bullets
don
t
show
any
respect
for
the
idea
of
coming
face
to
face
with
the
dreaded
bandits
mentioned
by
colomba
made
an
evident
impression
on
the
soldiers
the
sergeant
still
cursing
corporal
taupin
that
dog
of
a
frenchman
gave
the
order
to
retire
and
his
little
party
moved
toward
pietranera
carrying
the
and
the
as
for
the
pitcher
its
fate
was
settled
with
a
kick
one
of
the
men
would
have
laid
hold
of
miss
lydia
s
arm
but
colomba
instantly
pushed
him
away
let
none
of
you
dare
to
lay
a
finger
on
her
she
said
do
you
fancy
we
want
to
run
away
come
lydia
my
dear
lean
on
me
and
don
t
cry
like
a
baby
we
ve
had
an
adventure
but
it
will
end
all
right
in
half
an
hour
we
shall
be
at
our
supper
and
for
my
part
i
m
dying
to
get
to
what
will
they
think
of
me
miss
nevil
whispered
they
ll
think
you
lost
your
way
in
the
that
s
what
will
the
prefect
say
above
all
what
will
my
father
say
the
prefect
you
can
tell
him
to
mind
his
own
business
your
father
i
should
have
thought
from
the
way
you
and
orso
were
talking
that
you
had
something
to
say
to
your
miss
nevil
squeezed
her
arm
and
answered
nothing
doesn
t
my
brother
deserve
to
be
loved
whispered
colomba
in
her
ear
don
t
you
love
him
a
little
oh
colomba
answered
miss
nevil
smiling
in
spite
of
her
blushes
you
ve
betrayed
me
and
i
trusted
you
so
colomba
slipped
her
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
forehead
little
sister
she
whispered
very
low
will
you
forgive
me
why
i
suppose
i
must
my
masterful
sister
answered
lydia
as
she
kissed
her
back
the
prefect
and
the
public
prosecutor
were
staying
with
the
and
the
colonel
who
was
very
uneasy
about
his
daughter
was
paying
them
his
twentieth
call
to
ask
if
they
had
heard
of
her
when
a
rifleman
whom
the
sergeant
had
sent
on
in
advance
arrived
with
the
full
story
of
the
great
fight
with
the
brigands
a
fight
in
which
nobody
had
been
either
killed
or
wounded
but
which
had
resulted
in
the
capture
of
a
a
and
two
girls
whom
the
man
described
as
the
mistresses
or
the
spies
of
the
two
bandits
thus
heralded
the
two
prisoners
appeared
surrounded
by
their
armed
escort
my
readers
will
imagine
colomba
s
radiant
face
her
companion
s
confusion
the
prefect
s
surprise
the
colonel
s
astonishment
and
joy
the
public
prosecutor
permitted
himself
the
mischievous
entertainment
of
obliging
poor
lydia
to
undergo
a
kind
of
which
did
not
conclude
until
he
had
quite
put
her
out
of
countenance
it
seems
to
me
said
the
prefect
that
we
may
release
everybody
these
young
ladies
went
out
for
a
walk
nothing
is
more
natural
in
fine
weather
they
happened
to
meet
a
charming
young
man
who
has
been
lately
wounded
nothing
could
be
more
natural
then
taking
colomba
aside
signorina
he
said
you
can
send
word
to
your
brother
that
this
business
promises
to
turn
out
better
than
i
had
expected
the
examination
and
the
colonel
s
deposition
both
prove
that
he
only
defended
himself
and
that
he
was
alone
when
the
fight
took
place
everything
will
be
settled
only
he
must
leave
the
and
give
himself
up
to
the
it
was
almost
eleven
o
clock
when
the
colonel
his
daughter
and
colomba
sat
down
at
last
to
their
supper
which
had
grown
cold
colomba
ate
heartily
and
made
great
fun
of
the
prefect
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
soldiers
the
colonel
ate
too
but
never
said
a
word
and
gazed
steadily
at
his
daughter
who
would
not
lift
her
eyes
from
her
plate
at
last
gently
but
seriously
he
said
in
english
lydia
i
suppose
you
are
engaged
to
della
rebbia
yes
father
she
answered
steadily
though
she
blushed
then
she
raised
her
eyes
and
reading
no
sign
of
anger
in
her
father
s
face
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
kissed
him
as
all
young
ladies
do
on
such
occasions
with
all
my
heart
said
the
colonel
he
s
a
fine
fellow
but
by
g
d
we
won
t
live
in
this
d
country
of
his
or
i
ll
refuse
my
i
don
t
know
english
said
colomba
who
was
watching
them
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
curiosity
but
i
ll
wager
i
ve
guessed
what
you
are
saying
we
are
saying
quoth
the
colonel
that
we
are
going
to
take
you
for
a
trip
to
yes
with
pleasure
and
i
ll
be
the
surella
colomba
is
it
settled
colonel
shall
we
shake
hands
on
it
in
such
a
case
remarked
the
colonel
people
exchanges
kisses
chapter
xx
one
afternoon
a
few
months
after
the
double
shot
which
as
the
newspapers
said
plunged
the
village
of
pietranera
into
a
state
of
consternation
a
young
man
with
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
rode
out
of
bastia
toward
the
village
of
cardo
celebrated
for
its
spring
which
in
summer
supplies
the
more
fastidious
inhabitants
of
the
town
with
delicious
water
he
was
accompanied
by
a
young
lady
tall
and
remarkably
handsome
mounted
on
a
small
black
horse
the
strength
and
shape
of
which
would
have
attracted
the
admiration
of
a
connoisseur
although
by
some
strange
accident
one
of
its
ears
had
been
lacerated
on
reaching
the
village
the
girl
sprang
nimbly
to
the
ground
and
having
helped
her
comrade
to
dismount
she
unfastened
the
somewhat
heavy
wallets
strapped
to
his
the
horses
were
left
in
charge
of
a
peasant
the
girl
laden
with
the
wallets
which
she
had
concealed
under
her
and
the
young
man
carrying
a
gun
took
their
way
toward
the
mountain
along
a
very
steep
path
that
did
not
appear
to
lead
to
any
dwelling
when
they
had
climbed
to
one
of
the
lower
ridges
of
the
monte
querico
they
halted
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
they
were
evidently
expecting
somebody
for
they
kept
perpetually
looking
toward
the
mountain
and
the
young
lady
often
consulted
a
pretty
gold
watch
as
much
it
may
be
for
the
pleasure
of
admiring
what
appeared
a
somewhat
newly
acquired
trinket
as
in
order
to
know
whether
the
hour
appointed
for
some
meeting
or
other
had
come
they
had
not
long
to
wait
a
dog
ran
out
of
the
and
when
the
girl
called
out
brusco
it
approached
at
once
and
fawned
upon
them
presently
two
bearded
men
appeared
with
guns
under
their
arms
round
their
waists
and
pistols
hanging
at
their
sides
their
torn
and
patched
garments
contrasted
oddly
with
their
weapons
which
were
brilliantly
polished
and
came
from
a
famous
continental
factory
in
spite
of
the
apparent
inequality
of
their
positions
the
four
actors
in
this
scene
greeted
one
another
in
terms
of
old
and
familiar
friendship
well
ors
anton
said
the
elder
bandit
to
the
young
man
so
your
business
is
settled
the
indictment
against
you
has
fallen
through
i
congratulate
you
i
m
sorry
the
lawyer
has
left
the
island
i
d
like
to
see
his
rage
and
how
s
your
arm
they
tell
me
i
shall
get
rid
of
my
sling
in
a
fortnight
said
the
young
man
brando
my
good
friend
i
m
going
to
italy
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
and
to
the
cure
that
s
why
i
asked
you
to
come
you
re
in
a
fine
hurry
said
brandolaccio
only
acquitted
yesterday
and
you
re
off
business
must
be
attended
to
said
the
young
lady
merrily
gentlemen
i
ve
brought
some
supper
fall
to
if
you
please
and
don
t
you
forget
my
friend
you
spoil
brusco
mademoiselle
colomba
but
he
s
a
grateful
dog
you
shall
see
here
brusco
and
he
held
out
his
gun
horizontally
jump
for
the
barricini
the
dog
stood
motionless
licking
his
chops
and
staring
at
his
master
jump
for
the
della
rebbia
and
he
leaped
two
feet
higher
than
he
need
have
done
look
here
my
friends
said
orso
you
re
plying
a
bad
trade
and
even
if
you
don
t
end
your
career
on
that
square
below
us
the
best
you
can
look
for
is
to
die
in
the
by
some
gendarme
s
the
square
at
bastia
on
which
executions
take
place
well
well
said
castriconi
that
s
no
more
than
death
anyhow
and
it
s
better
than
being
killed
in
your
bed
by
a
fever
with
your
heirs
snivelling
more
or
less
honestly
all
round
you
to
men
who
are
accustomed
to
the
open
air
like
us
there
s
nothing
so
good
as
to
die
in
your
shoes
as
the
village
folk
i
should
like
to
see
you
get
out
of
this
country
said
orso
and
lead
a
quieter
life
for
instance
why
shouldn
t
you
settle
in
sardinia
as
several
of
your
comrades
have
done
i
could
make
the
matter
easy
for
in
sardinia
cried
brandolaccio
sardos
devil
take
them
and
their
lingo
we
couldn
t
live
in
such
bad
sardinia
s
a
country
without
resources
added
the
theologian
for
my
part
i
despise
the
sardinians
they
keep
mounted
men
to
hunt
their
bandits
that
s
a
stigma
on
both
the
bandits
and
the
country
out
upon
sardinia
say
i
the
thing
that
astounds
me
signor
della
rebbia
is
that
you
who
are
a
man
of
taste
and
understanding
should
not
have
taken
to
our
life
in
the
after
having
once
tried
it
as
you
i
owe
this
criticism
of
sardinia
to
an
of
my
acquaintance
and
he
alone
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
it
he
means
that
bandits
who
let
themselves
be
caught
by
horse
soldiers
are
idiots
and
that
soldiers
who
try
to
catch
bandits
on
horseback
have
very
little
chance
of
getting
at
them
well
said
orso
with
a
smile
when
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
your
guest
i
wasn
t
in
very
good
case
for
enjoying
the
charms
of
your
position
and
my
ribs
still
ache
when
i
think
of
the
ride
i
took
one
lovely
night
thrown
like
a
bundle
across
an
unsaddled
horse
that
my
good
friend
brandolaccio
and
the
delight
of
escaping
from
your
pursuers
rejoined
castriconi
is
that
nothing
to
you
how
can
you
fail
to
realize
the
charm
of
absolute
freedom
in
such
a
beautiful
climate
as
ours
with
this
to
insure
respect
and
he
held
up
his
gun
we
are
kings
of
everything
within
its
range
we
can
give
orders
we
can
redress
wrongs
that
s
a
highly
moral
entertainment
monsieur
and
a
very
pleasant
one
which
we
don
t
deny
ourselves
what
can
be
more
beautiful
than
a
s
life
when
he
has
good
weapons
and
more
common
sense
than
don
quixote
had
listen
the
other
day
i
was
told
that
little
lilla
luigi
s
uncle
old
miser
that
he
is
wouldn
t
give
her
a
dowry
so
i
wrote
to
him
i
didn
t
use
threats
that
s
not
my
way
well
well
in
one
moment
the
man
was
convinced
he
married
his
niece
and
i
made
two
people
happy
believe
me
orso
there
s
no
life
like
the
bandit
s
life
pshaw
you
d
have
joined
us
perhaps
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
a
certain
young
englishwoman
whom
i
have
scarcely
seen
myself
but
about
whose
beauty
every
one
in
bastia
is
my
future
doesn
t
like
the
laughed
colomba
she
got
too
great
a
fright
in
one
of
well
said
orso
you
are
resolved
to
stay
here
so
be
it
but
tell
me
whether
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
said
brandolaccio
you
ve
heaped
kindnesses
upon
us
here
s
little
chilina
with
her
dowry
ready
so
that
there
ll
be
no
necessity
for
my
friend
the
cure
to
write
one
of
his
persuasive
letters
to
insure
her
marrying
well
we
know
the
man
on
your
farm
will
give
us
bread
and
powder
whenever
we
need
them
so
fare
you
well
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
back
in
corsica
one
of
these
in
case
of
pressing
need
said
orso
a
few
gold
coins
are
very
useful
now
we
are
such
old
friends
you
won
t
refuse
this
little
it
will
help
you
to
provide
cartridges
of
another
means
a
collection
of
gold
pieces
as
well
as
a
cartridge
no
money
between
you
and
me
sir
said
brandolaccio
resolutely
in
the
world
money
is
everything
remarked
castriconi
but
in
the
all
a
man
need
care
for
is
a
brave
heart
and
a
gun
that
carries
i
don
t
want
to
leave
you
without
giving
you
something
to
remember
me
by
persisted
orso
come
brandolaccio
what
can
i
leave
with
you
the
bandit
scratched
his
head
and
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
orso
s
gun
by
my
faith
if
i
dared
but
no
you
re
too
fond
of
what
would
you
like
nothing
tisn
t
anything
at
all
it
s
knowing
how
to
use
it
as
well
i
keep
thinking
of
that
devil
of
a
of
yours
and
with
only
one
hand
too
oh
that
never
could
happen
twice
over
is
it
the
gun
you
fancy
i
bought
it
for
you
but
see
you
don
t
use
it
more
than
you
are
oh
i
won
t
promise
to
make
as
good
use
of
it
as
you
but
make
your
mind
easy
when
any
other
man
has
it
you
may
be
certain
it
s
all
over
with
brando
and
you
castriconi
what
am
i
to
give
you
since
you
really
insist
on
giving
me
some
tangible
keepsake
i
ll
simply
ask
you
to
send
me
the
smallest
horace
you
can
get
it
will
amuse
me
and
prevent
me
from
forgetting
all
my
latin
there
s
a
little
woman
who
sells
cigars
on
the
jetty
at
bastia
if
you
give
it
to
her
she
ll
see
i
get
you
shall
have
an
elzevir
my
erudite
friend
there
just
happens
to
be
one
among
some
books
i
was
going
to
take
away
with
me
well
good
friends
we
must
part
give
me
your
hands
if
you
should
ever
think
of
sardinia
write
to
me
signor
the
notary
will
give
you
my
address
on
the
lieutenant
said
brando
when
you
get
out
in
the
harbour
look
up
to
this
spot
on
the
we
shall
be
here
and
we
ll
wave
our
handkerchiefs
to
and
so
they
parted
orso
and
his
sister
took
their
way
back
to
cardo
and
the
bandits
departed
up
the
mountain
chapter
xxi
one
lovely
april
morning
sir
thomas
nevil
his
daughter
a
newly
made
bride
orso
and
colomba
drove
out
of
pisa
to
see
a
lately
discovered
etruscan
vault
to
which
all
strangers
who
came
to
that
part
of
the
country
paid
a
visit
orso
and
his
wife
went
down
into
the
ancient
building
pulled
out
their
pencils
and
began
to
sketch
the
mural
paintings
but
the
colonel
and
colomba
who
neither
of
them
cared
much
for
archaeology
left
them
to
themselves
and
walked
about
in
the
neighbourhood
my
dear
colomba
said
the
colonel
we
shall
never
get
back
to
pisa
in
time
for
lunch
aren
t
you
hungry
there
are
orso
and
his
wife
buried
in
their
antiquities
when
once
they
begin
sketching
together
it
lasts
forever
yes
remarked
colomba
and
yet
they
never
bring
the
smallest
sketch
home
with
i
think
proceeded
the
colonel
our
best
plan
would
be
to
make
our
way
to
that
little
yonder
we
should
find
bread
there
and
perhaps
some
who
knows
we
might
even
find
strawberries
and
cream
and
then
we
should
be
able
to
wait
patiently
for
our
you
are
quite
right
colonel
you
and
i
are
the
reasonable
members
of
this
family
we
should
be
very
foolish
if
we
let
ourselves
by
martyrized
by
that
pair
of
lovers
who
live
on
poetry
give
me
your
arm
don
t
you
think
i
m
improving
i
lean
on
people
s
arms
wear
fashionable
hats
and
gowns
and
trinkets
i
m
learning
i
don
t
know
how
many
fine
things
i
m
not
at
all
a
young
savage
any
more
just
observe
the
grace
with
which
i
wear
this
shawl
that
spark
that
officer
belonging
to
your
regiment
who
came
to
the
wedding
oh
dear
i
can
t
recollect
his
name
a
tall
man
whom
i
could
knock
over
with
one
hand
chatsworth
suggested
the
colonel
that
s
it
but
i
never
shall
be
able
to
say
it
well
you
know
he
s
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
me
o
colomba
you
re
growing
a
terrible
flirt
we
shall
have
another
wedding
before
i
marry
and
then
who
will
there
be
to
bring
up
my
nephew
when
orso
provides
me
with
a
nephew
and
who
ll
teach
him
to
talk
corsican
yes
he
shall
talk
corsican
and
i
ll
make
him
a
peaked
cap
just
to
vex
well
well
wait
till
you
have
your
nephew
and
then
you
shall
teach
him
to
use
a
dagger
if
you
farewell
to
daggers
said
colomba
merrily
i
have
a
fan
now
to
rap
your
fingers
with
when
you
speak
ill
of
my
chatting
thus
they
reached
the
where
they
found
wine
strawberries
and
cream
colomba
helped
the
farmer
s
wife
to
gather
the
strawberries
while
the
colonel
drank
his
at
the
turning
of
a
path
she
caught
sight
of
an
old
man
sitting
in
the
sun
on
a
straw
chair
he
seemed
ill
his
cheeks
were
fallen
in
his
eyes
were
hollow
he
was
frightfully
thin
as
he
sat
there
motionless
pallid
staring
fixedly
in
front
of
him
he
looked
more
like
a
corpse
than
like
a
living
creature
colomba
watched
him
for
some
minutes
and
with
a
curiosity
so
great
that
it
attracted
the
woman
s
attention
that
poor
old
fellow
is
a
countryman
of
yours
she
said
for
i
know
you
are
from
corsica
by
the
way
you
talk
signorina
he
has
had
great
trouble
in
his
own
country
his
children
met
with
some
terrible
death
they
say
you
ll
excuse
me
signorina
that
when
they
quarrel
your
compatriots
don
t
show
each
other
very
much
mercy
then
the
poor
old
gentleman
being
left
all
alone
came
over
to
pisa
to
a
distant
relation
of
his
who
owns
this
farm
between
his
misfortunes
and
his
sorrow
the
good
man
is
a
little
cracked
the
lady
found
him
troublesome
for
she
sees
a
great
deal
of
company
so
she
sent
him
out
here
he
s
very
gentle
no
worry
at
all
he
doesn
t
speak
three
words
the
whole
day
long
in
fact
his
brain
s
quite
gone
the
doctor
comes
to
see
him
every
week
he
says
he
won
t
live
there
s
no
hope
for
him
then
said
colomba
in
such
a
case
death
will
be
a
you
might
say
a
word
to
him
in
corsican
signorina
perhaps
it
would
cheer
him
up
to
hear
the
speech
of
his
own
i
ll
see
said
colomba
and
her
smile
was
mysterious
she
drew
nearer
to
the
old
man
till
her
shadow
fell
across
his
chair
then
the
poor
idiot
lifted
his
head
and
stared
at
colomba
while
she
looked
at
him
smiling
still
after
a
moment
the
old
man
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
closed
his
eyes
as
though
he
would
have
shut
out
the
sight
of
colomba
he
opened
them
again
desperately
wide
this
time
his
lips
began
to
work
he
tried
to
stretch
out
his
hands
but
fascinated
by
colomba
s
glance
he
sat
nailed
as
it
were
to
his
chair
unable
to
move
or
utter
a
word
at
last
great
tears
dropped
from
his
eyes
and
a
few
sobs
escaped
from
his
heaving
chest
tis
the
first
time
i
ve
seen
him
like
this
said
the
good
woman
this
signorina
belongs
to
your
own
country
she
has
come
to
see
you
said
she
to
the
old
man
mercy
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
mercy
are
you
not
content
the
leaf
i
burned
how
did
you
read
it
but
why
did
you
take
them
both
orlanduccio
you
can
t
have
read
anything
against
him
you
should
have
left
me
one
only
one
orlanduccio
you
didn
t
read
name
i
had
to
have
them
both
answered
colomba
speaking
low
and
in
the
corsican
dialect
the
branches
are
topped
off
if
the
stem
had
not
been
rotten
i
would
have
torn
it
up
come
make
no
moan
you
will
not
suffer
long
suffered
for
two
years
the
old
man
cried
out
and
then
his
head
dropped
on
his
breast
colomba
turned
her
back
on
him
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
humming
some
meaningless
lines
out
of
a
i
must
have
the
hand
that
fired
the
eye
that
aimed
the
heart
that
while
the
farmer
s
wife
ran
to
attend
on
the
old
man
colomba
with
blazing
eyes
and
brilliant
cheeks
sat
down
to
luncheon
opposite
the
colonel
what
s
the
matter
with
you
he
said
you
look
just
as
you
did
that
day
at
pietranera
when
they
fired
at
us
while
we
were
at
old
corsican
memories
had
come
back
to
me
but
all
that

done
with

shall
be
godmother
sha
n
t
i
oh

fine
names

ll
give
him
ghilfuccio
tomaso
orso
leone
the
farmer
s
wife
came
back
into
the
room
well
inquired
colomba
with
the
most
perfect
composure
is
he
dead
or
had
he
only
fainted
it
was
nothing
signorina
but
it
s
curious
what
an
effect
the
sight
of
you
had
on
and
the
doctor
says
he
won
t
last
long
not
two
months
very
he
ll
be
no
great
loss
remarked
colomba
what
the
devil
are

talking
about

the
colonel
about
an
idiot
from
my
own
country
who
is
boarded
out
here

time
to
time

how
he
is
why
colonel
nevil
aren
t
you

to
leave

strawberries

and
my
brother
when
colomba
left
the
and
got
into
the
carriage
the
farmer
s
wife
looked
after
her
for
a
while
then
turning
to
her
daughter

pretty
young
lady

said
well

the
evil
eye
