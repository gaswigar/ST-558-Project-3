a
fool
jimmy
turned
to
step
from
the
gutter
to
the
sidewalk
two
things
happened
to
him
simultaneously
mickey
became
a
projectile
he
smashed
with
the
force
of
a
wiry
fist
on
the
larger
boy
head
while
above
both
an
athletic
arm
gripped
him
by
the
collar
douglas
bruce
was
hurrying
to
see
a
client
before
he
should
leave
his
office
but
in
passing
a
florist
window
his
eye
was
attracted
by
a
sight
so
beautiful
he
paused
an
instant
considering
it
was
spring
the
indians
were
coming
down
to
multiopolis
to
teach
people
what
the
wood
gods
had
put
into
their
hearts
about
flower
magic
the
watcher
scarcely
had
realized
the
exquisite
loveliness
of
a
birch
basket
filled
with
bog
moss
of
silvery
green
in
which
were
set
maidenhair
and
three
yellow
lady
slippers
until
beside
it
was
placed
another
woven
of
osiers
blood
red
moss
carpeted
and
bearing
five
pink
moccasin
flowers
faintly
fined
with
red
lavender
between
them
rosemary
and
white
ladies
tresses
a
flush
crept
over
the
lean
face
of
the
scotsman
he
saw
a
vision
over
those
baskets
bent
a
girl
beautiful
as
the
flowers
plainly
as
he
visualized
the
glory
of
the
swamp
douglas
bruce
pictured
the
woman
he
loved
above
the
orchids
while
he
lingered
his
heart
warmed
glowing
his
wonderful
spring
day
made
more
wonderful
by
a
vision
not
adequately
describable
on
his
ear
fell
mickey
admonition
be
square
he
sent
one
hasty
glance
toward
the
gutter
he
saw
a
newsboy
of
a
size
that
precluded
longer
success
at
paper
selling
because
public
sympathy
goes
to
the
little
fellows
before
him
stood
one
of
these
same
little
fellows
lean
and
clean
of
face
neat
in
dress
with
a
peculiar
modulation
in
his
voice
that
caught
douglas
squarely
in
the
heart
he
turned
again
to
the
flowers
but
as
his
eyes
revelled
in
beauty
his
ears
despite
the
shuffle
of
passing
feet
and
the
clamour
of
cars
lost
not
one
word
of
what
was
passing
in
the
gutter
while
with
each
slow
anger
surged
higher
mickey
well
aware
that
his
first
blow
would
be
all
the
satisfaction
coming
to
him
put
the
force
of
his
being
into
his
punch
at
the
same
instant
douglas
thrust
forth
a
hand
that
had
pulled
for
oxford
and
was
yet
in
condition
aw
you
big
stiff
gasped
jimmy
twisting
an
astonished
neck
to
see
what
was
happening
above
and
in
his
rear
so
surprisingly
had
that
little
mickey
gone
mad
to
hit
mickey
standing
back
his
face
upturned
was
quite
as
surprised
as
jimmy
what
did
he
promise
you
for
selling
his
papers
demanded
a
deep
voice
twen
answered
mickey
with
all
the
force
of
inflection
in
his
power
and
if
you
heard
us
mister
you
heard
him
own
up
he
was
owing
it
i
did
answered
douglas
bruce
tersely
then
to
jimmy
hand
him
over
cents
jimmy
glared
upward
but
what
he
saw
and
the
tightening
of
the
hand
on
his
collar
were
convincing
he
drew
from
his
pocket
five
nickels
dropping
them
into
the
outstretched
hand
of
douglas
who
passed
them
to
mickey
the
soiled
fingers
of
whose
left
hand
closed
over
them
while
his
right
snatched
off
his
cap
fear
was
on
his
face
excitement
was
in
his
eyes
triumph
was
in
his
voice
while
a
grin
of
comradeship
curved
his
lips
many
thanks
boss
he
said
and
would
you
add
to
them
by
keeping
that
strangle
hold
you
give
me
just
two
seconds
the
start
of
him
he
wheeled
darting
through
the
crowd
mickey
cried
douglas
bruce
mickey
wait
but
mickey
was
half
a
block
away
turning
into
an
alley
the
man
grip
tightened
a
twist
you
find
mickey
admonition
good
he
said
i
advise
you
to
take
it
square
and
two
things
first
i
got
an
eye
on
the
mickeys
of
this
city
if
i
ever
again
find
you
imposing
on
him
or
any
one
else
i
put
you
where
you
ca
understand
second
who
is
he
mickey
answered
the
boy
mickey
who
asked
douglas
how
i
know
queried
jimmy
you
do
know
his
name
pursued
douglas
naw
i
do
said
the
boy
where
does
he
live
continued
douglas
i
do
know
answered
jimmy
if
you
have
a
charge
to
prefer
i
take
that
youngster
in
for
you
offered
a
policeman
passing
on
his
beat
he
was
imposing
on
a
smaller
newsboy
i
made
him
quit
douglas
explained
that
all
oh
said
the
officer
withdrawing
his
hand
away
sped
jimmy
with
him
went
all
chance
of
identifying
mickey
but
bruce
thought
he
would
watch
for
him
he
was
such
an
attractive
little
fellow
mickey
raced
through
the
first
alley
down
a
street
then
looked
behind
jimmy
was
not
in
sight
got
to
dodge
now
he
muttered
if
he
ever
gets
a
grip
on
me
he
hammer
me
meller
i
going
to
have
a
bulldog
if
i
half
starve
to
buy
it
maybe
the
pound
would
give
me
one
i
see
he
looked
long
then
started
homeward
which
meant
to
jump
on
a
car
and
ride
for
miles
then
follow
streets
and
alleys
again
finally
he
entered
a
last
alley
that
faced
due
east
a
compass
could
not
have
pointed
more
directly
toward
the
rising
sun
while
there
was
at
least
half
an
hour
each
clear
morning
when
rickety
stairs
wavering
flapping
washes
and
unkept
children
were
submerged
in
golden
light
long
ago
it
had
been
named
by
the
time
of
advent
sunrise
alley
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
map
of
multiopolis
as
biddle
boulevard
and
infinitely
more
pleasing
in
name
he
began
climbing
interminable
stairs
at
the
top
of
the
last
flight
he
unlocked
his
door
to
enter
his
happy
home
for
mickey
had
a
home
and
it
was
a
happy
one
no
one
else
lived
in
it
while
all
it
contained
was
his
mickey
knew
three
things
about
his
father
he
had
had
one
he
was
not
square
and
he
drank
himself
to
death
he
could
not
remember
his
father
but
he
knew
many
men
engaged
in
the
occupation
of
his
passing
so
he
well
understood
why
his
mother
never
expressed
any
regrets
vivid
in
his
mind
was
her
face
anxious
and
pale
but
twinkling
her
body
frail
and
overtaxed
but
hitting
back
at
life
uncomplainingly
bad
things
happened
but
she
explained
how
they
might
have
been
worse
so
fed
on
this
sop
and
watching
her
example
mickey
grew
like
her
the
difficult
time
was
while
she
sat
over
a
sewing
machine
to
be
with
him
when
he
grew
and
he
could
be
sent
after
the
food
to
carry
the
rent
and
to
sell
papers
then
she
could
work
by
the
day
earn
more
have
better
health
while
what
both
brought
home
paid
the
rent
of
the
top
room
back
of
as
bad
a
shamble
as
a
city
would
allow
kept
them
fed
satisfyingly
if
not
nourishingly
and
allowed
them
to
slip
away
many
a
nickel
for
the
rainy
day
that
she
always
explained
would
come
and
it
did
one
morning
she
could
not
get
up
the
following
mickey
gave
all
their
savings
to
a
man
with
a
wagon
to
take
her
to
a
nice
place
to
rest
the
man
was
sure
about
it
being
a
nice
place
she
had
told
mickey
so
often
what
to
do
if
this
ever
happened
that
when
it
did
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
remember
what
he
had
been
told
after
it
was
over
and
the
nice
place
had
been
paid
for
with
the
nickels
and
the
sewing
machine
with
enough
left
for
the
first
month
rent
mickey
faced
life
alone
but
he
knew
exactly
what
to
do
because
she
had
told
him
she
had
even
written
it
down
lest
he
forget
it
was
so
simple
that
only
a
boy
who
did
not
mind
his
mother
could
have
failed
the
formula
worked
perfectly
get
up
early
wash
your
face
brush
your
clothes
eat
what
was
left
from
supper
for
breakfast
put
your
bed
to
air
then
go
out
with
your
papers
do
be
afraid
to
offer
them
or
to
do
work
of
any
sort
you
have
strength
for
but
be
deathly
afraid
to
beg
to
lie
or
to
steal
while
if
you
starve
freeze
or
die
never
never
touch
any
kind
of
any
fellow
could
do
that
mickey
told
dozens
of
them
so
he
got
along
so
well
he
could
pay
the
rent
each
month
dress
in
whole
clothing
have
enough
to
eat
often
cooked
food
on
the
little
gasoline
stove
if
he
were
not
too
tired
to
cook
it
and
hide
nickels
in
the
old
place
daily
he
had
a
bed
and
enough
cover
he
could
get
water
in
the
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
his
room
for
his
bath
to
scrub
the
floor
and
wash
the
dishes
from
two
years
on
he
had
helped
his
mother
with
every
detail
of
her
housekeeping
he
knew
exactly
what
must
be
done
it
was
much
more
dreadful
than
he
thought
it
would
be
to
come
home
alone
and
eat
supper
by
himself
but
if
he
sold
papers
until
he
was
almost
asleep
where
he
stood
he
found
he
went
to
sleep
as
soon
as
he
reached
home
and
had
supper
he
did
not
awaken
until
morning
then
he
could
hurry
his
work
and
get
ahead
of
the
other
boys
and
maybe
sell
to
their
customers
it
might
be
bad
to
be
alone
but
always
he
could
remember
her
and
make
her
seem
present
by
doing
every
day
exactly
what
she
told
him
then
after
all
being
alone
was
a
very
wonderful
thing
compared
with
having
parents
who
might
beat
and
starve
him
and
take
the
last
penny
he
earned
not
leaving
enough
to
keep
him
from
being
hungry
half
the
time
when
mickey
looked
at
some
of
the
other
boys
and
heard
many
of
them
talk
he
almost
forgot
the
hourly
hunger
for
his
mother
in
thankfulness
that
he
did
not
have
a
father
and
that
his
mother
had
been
herself
mickey
felt
sure
that
if
she
had
been
any
one
of
the
mothers
of
most
other
boys
he
knew
he
would
not
have
gone
home
at
all
he
could
endure
cold
hunger
and
loneliness
but
he
felt
that
he
had
no
talent
for
being
robbed
beaten
and
starved
while
lately
he
had
fully
decided
upon
a
dog
for
company
when
he
could
find
the
right
one
mickey
unlocked
his
door
entering
for
his
water
bucket
such
was
his
faith
in
his
environment
that
he
relocked
the
door
while
he
went
to
the
water
tap
returning
to
the
room
he
again
turned
the
key
then
washed
his
face
and
hands
he
looked
at
the
slip
nailed
on
the
wall
where
she
had
put
it
he
knew
every
word
of
it
but
always
it
comforted
him
to
see
her
familiar
writing
to
read
aloud
what
to
do
next
as
if
it
were
her
voice
speaking
to
him
evening
make
up
your
bed
mickey
made
his
wash
any
dirty
dishes
he
had
a
few
so
he
washed
them
sweep
your
floor
he
swept
always
prepare
at
least
one
hot
thing
for
supper
he
shook
the
gasoline
tank
to
the
little
stove
it
sounded
full
enough
so
he
went
to
the
cupboard
his
mother
had
made
from
a
small
packing
case
there
were
half
a
loaf
of
bread
wrapped
in
its
oiled
paper
with
two
bananas
discarded
by
joe
of
the
fruit
stand
he
examined
his
pocket
although
he
knew
perfectly
what
it
contained
laying
back
enough
to
pay
for
his
stock
the
next
day
then
counting
in
his
cents
he
had
forty
cents
left
he
put
thirty
in
the
rent
box
starting
out
with
ten
five
paid
for
a
bottle
of
milk
three
for
cheese
two
for
an
egg
for
breakfast
then
he
went
home
at
the
foot
of
the
that
he
used
in
preference
to
the
stairs
he
met
a
boy
he
knew
tugging
a
heavy
basket
take
an
end
for
a
nickel
said
the
boy
thanks
said
mickey
it
my
time
to
dine
i
been
done
once
if
you
take
it
i
pay
first
he
offered
how
far
questioned
mickey
oh
right
over
here
said
the
boy
indefinitely
sure
said
mickey
cross
my
palm
with
the
silver
the
nickel
changed
hands
mickey
put
the
cheese
and
egg
in
his
pocket
the
milk
in
the
basket
then
started
the
place
where
they
delivered
the
wash
made
mickey
feel
almost
prosperous
he
picked
up
his
milk
bottle
and
stepped
from
the
door
when
a
long
low
wail
that
made
him
shudder
reached
his
ear
what
that
he
asked
the
woman
a
stiff
was
carried
past
mebby
they
ai
took
the
kids
yet
mickey
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
his
face
sober
that
was
what
his
mother
had
feared
for
him
that
was
why
she
had
trained
him
to
care
for
himself
to
save
the
pennies
so
that
when
she
was
taken
away
he
still
would
have
a
home
sounded
like
a
child
he
was
halfway
up
the
long
flight
of
stairs
before
he
realized
that
he
was
going
he
found
the
door
at
last
then
stood
listening
he
heard
moaning
presently
he
knocked
a
child
shriek
was
the
answer
mickey
straightway
opened
the
door
the
voice
guided
him
to
a
heap
of
misery
in
a
corner
what
the
matter
kid
inquired
mickey
huskily
the
bundle
stirred
while
a
cry
issued
he
glanced
around
the
room
what
he
saw
reassured
him
he
laid
hold
of
the
tatters
beginning
to
uncover
what
was
under
them
he
dropped
his
hands
stepping
back
when
a
tangled
yellow
mop
and
a
weazened
bloated
face
peered
at
him
with
wildly
frightened
eyes
if
you
put
the
wind
you
wastin
into
words
we
get
something
done
quicker
advised
mickey
the
tiny
creature
clutched
the
filthy
covers
still
staring
did
you
come
to
me
she
quavered
no
said
mickey
i
heard
you
from
below
so
i
came
to
see
what
hurt
you
ai
you
got
folks
she
shook
her
head
they
took
granny
in
a
box
and
they
said

back
and
me
oh
please
please
do
let
them
why
they
be
good
to
you
said
mickey
largely
they
give
you
he
glanced
at
all
the
things
the
room
lacked
then
enumerated
a
clean
bed
lots
to
eat
a
window
you
could
be
seeing
from
a
doll
maybe
no

she
cried
granny

day

she
growled
how

he
said
at
the
point
of
rebellion
mickey

basket
down

here
he
ordered
i
be
back
in
no

with
the
he

in
a
few

into
her
outstretched
palm
he
counted

from

around
a
corner
calling

minute
and

mickey
climbed
a
flight
then
sat
down
until
he
could
manage
another
the
last
flight
he
rested
three
times
one
reason
he
laid
peaches
on
the
floor
was
because
he
could
reach
the
bed
after
a
second
pause
he
made
a
light
and
opened
the
milk
bottle
connect
with
that

the
rich
folks
dolling
up
the
dogs
feeding
them
candy
and

hurried
back
to
his
room
the
milk
bottle
lay
on
the
floor
the
child
asleep
beside
it
the
boy
gazed
at
her
there
were
strange
and
peculiar
stirrings
in
his
lonely
little
heart
she
was
so
grimy
he
scarcely
could
tell
what
she
looked
like

the
grip

oh
mickey

she
cried
sure
said
mickey
now
you
sit
up
and
i
wash
you
like
mammy
always
did
me
peaches
obeyed
mickey
soaped
a
cloth
knelt
beside
her
then
he
paused
say
peaches
when
was
your
hair
combed
last
i
do
know
mickey
she
answered
there
more
dirt
in
it
than
there
is
on
your
face
if
you
got
shears
just
cut
it
off
she
suggested
sure
said
mickey
he
produced
shears
and
lifting
string
after
string
cut
all
of
them
the
same
distance
from
her
head
girls
should
be
short
like
boys
he
explained
now
hang
your
head
over
the
edge
of
the
tub
and
shut
your
eyes
so
i
can
wash
it
he
ordered
mickey
soaped
and
scoured
until
the
last
tangle
was
gone
then
rinsed
and
partly
dried
the
hair
which
felt
soft
and
fine
to
his
fingers
it
going
to
curl
he
said
always
did
she
answered
mickey
emptied
and
rinsed
the
tub
at
the
drain
then
started
again
on
her
face
and
ears
which
he
washed
thoroughly
he
pinned
a
sheet
around
her
neck
then
she
divested
herself
of
the
rags
mickey
lifted
her
into
the
tub
draped
the
sheet
over
the
edge
poured
in
the
water
and
handed
her
the
soap
now
you
scour
while
i
get
supper
he
said
peaches
did
her
best
mickey
locked
her
in
and
went
after
more
milk
he
wanted
to
add
several
extras
but
remembering
the
awful
hole
the
dollar
had
made
in
his
finances
he
said
grimly
with
a
family
to
keep
and
likely
to
need
a
doctor
at
any
time
and
a
carrel
back
to
buy
there
no
frills
for
mickey
seeing
what
she
ai
had
she
ought
to
be
thankful
for
just
milk
so
he
went
back
lifted
peaches
from
the
tub
and
laid
her
on
the
floor
where
he
dried
her
with
the
sheet
then
he
put
the
nightdress
over
her
head
she
slipped
her
arms
in
the
sleeves
and
he
stretched
her
on
his
bed
she
was
so
lost
in
the
garment
he
tied
a
string
under
her
arms
to
hold
it
and
cut
off
the
sleeves
at
her
elbows
the
pieces
he
saved
for
washcloths
mickey
spread
his
sheet
over
her
rolled
the
bed
before
the
window
where
she
could
have
air
see
sky
and
housetops
then
brought
her
supper
it
was
a
cup
of
milk
with
half
the
bread
broken
in
and
a
banana
peaches
was
too
tired
to
eat
so
she
drank
the
milk
while
mickey
finished
the
remainder
then
he
threw
her
rags
from
the
window
and
spread
his
winter
covers
on
the
floor
for
his
bed
soon
both
of
them
were
asleep
chapter
ii
and
lady
no
messenger
boy
for
those
said
douglas
bruce
as
he
handed
the
florist
the
price
set
on
the
lady
slippers
leave
them
where
people
may
enjoy
them
until
i
call
as
he
turned
another
man
was
inquiring
about
the
orchids
he
too
preferred
the
slippers
but
when
he
was
told
they
were
taken
he
had
wanted
the
moccasins
all
the
time
anyway
the
basket
was
far
more
attractive
he
refused
delivery
returning
to
his
waiting
car
smiling
over
the
flowers
he
also
saw
a
vision
of
the
woman
into
whose
sated
life
he
hoped
to
bring
a
breath
of
change
with
the
wonderful
gift
he
saw
the
basket
in
her
hands
and
thrilled
in
anticipation
of
the
favours
her
warmed
heart
might
prompt
her
to
bestow
upon
him
in
the
mists
of
early
morning
the
pink
orchids
surrounded
by
rosemary
and
ladies
tresses
had
glowed
and
gleamed
from
the
top
of
a
silvery
moss
mound
four
feet
deep
under
a
big
tamarack
in
a
swamp
through
the
bog
of
which
the
squaw
plunged
to
her
knees
at
each
step
to
uproot
them
in
the
evening
glow
of
electricity
snapped
from
their
stems
the
beautiful
basket
untouched
the
moccasins
lay
on
the
breast
of
a
woman
of
fashion
while
with
every
second
of
contact
with
the
warmth
of
her
body
they
drooped
lower
until
clasped
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
they
were
quite
crushed
then
flung
from
an
automobile
to
be
ground
to
pulp
by
passing
wheels
the
slippers
had
a
happier
fate
douglas
bruce
carried
them
reverently
he
was
sure
he
knew
the
swamp
in
which
they
grew
as
he
went
his
way
he
held
the
basket
in
strong
hands
swaying
his
body
with
the
motion
of
the
car
lest
one
leaf
be
damaged
when
he
entered
the
hall
down
the
stairs
came
leslie
winton
why
douglas
i
was
expecting
you
she
said
douglas
bruce
held
up
the
basket
joy
she
cried
oh
joy
unspeakable
who
has
been
to
the
tamarack
swamp
a
squaw
was
leaving
lowry
as
he
put
these
in
his
window
answered
douglas
bring
them
she
said
he
followed
to
a
wide
side
veranda
set
the
basket
on
a
table
in
a
cool
spot
then
drew
a
chair
near
it
leslie
winton
seated
herself
leaning
on
the
table
to
study
the
orchids
unconsciously
she
made
the
picture
douglas
had
seen
she
reached
up
slim
fingers
in
delicate
touchings
here
and
there
of
moss
corolla
and
slipper
never
in
all
my
days
she
said
never
in
all
my
days
i
shall
keep
the
basket
always
and
the
slippers
as
long
as
i
possibly
can
see
this
one
it
is
fully
open
i
should
have
them
for
a
week
at
least
please
hand
me
a
glass
of
water
douglas
started
to
say
that
ice
water
would
be
too
cold
but
with
the
wisdom
of
a
wise
man
waited
and
as
always
was
joyed
by
the
waiting
for
the
girl
took
the
glass
and
cupping
her
hands
around
it
sat
talking
to
the
flowers
and
to
him
as
she
warmed
the
water
with
heat
from
her
body
douglas
was
so
delighted
with
the
unforeseen
second
that
had
given
him
first
chance
at
the
orchids
and
so
this
unexpected
call
that
he
did
not
mind
the
attention
she
gave
the
flowers
he
had
reasons
for
not
being
extravagant
but
seldom
had
a
like
sum
brought
such
returns
he
began
drawing
interest
as
he
watched
leslie
never
had
her
form
seemed
so
perfect
her
dress
so
becoming
and
simple
how
could
other
women
make
a
vulgar
display
in
the
same
pattern
that
clothed
her
modestly
how
wonderful
were
the
soft
coils
of
her
hair
the
tints
paling
and
flushing
on
her
cheeks
her
shining
eyes
why
could
not
all
women
use
her
low
even
perfectly
accented
speech
and
deliberate
he
was
in
daily
intercourse
with
her
father
a
high
official
of
the
city
a
man
of
education
social
position
and
wealth
winton
had
reared
his
only
child
according
to
his
ideas
but
douglas
knowing
these
things
believed
in
blood
also
as
leslie
turned
and
warmed
the
water
watching
her
the
thought
was
strong
in
his
mind
what
a
woman
her
mother
must
have
been
each
day
he
was
with
leslie
he
saw
her
do
things
that
no
amount
of
culture
could
instil
instinct
and
tact
are
inborn
careful
rearing
may
produce
a
good
imitation
they
are
genuine
only
with
blood
leslie
had
always
filled
his
ideal
of
a
true
woman
to
ignore
him
for
his
gift
would
have
piqued
many
a
man
douglas
bruce
was
pleased
you
wonders
she
said
softly
oh
you
wonders
when
the
mists
lifted
in
the
marshes
this
morning
and
the
first
ray
of
gold
touched
you
to
equal
goldness
you
did
know
you
were
coming
to
me
i
almost
wish
i
could
put
you
back
just
now
you
should
be
in
such
cool
mistiness
while
you
should
be
hearing
a
hermit
thrush
sing
vespers
a
cedar
bird
call
and
a
cry
but
i
glad
i
have
you
oh
i
so
glad
you
came
to
me
i
never
materialized
a
whole
swamp
with
such
vividness
as
only
this
little
part
of
it
brings
douglas
when
you
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
these
how
far
into
the
swamp
did
you
see
past
them
to
the
heart
of
the
swamp
and
of
my
heart
i
can
see
it
as
perfectly
as
i
ever
did
she
said
but
i
eliminate
the
squaw
possibly
because
i
did
see
her
and
however
exquisite
the
basket
is
she
broke
the
law
when
she
peeled
a
birch
tree
i
wager
she
brought
this
to
lowry
carefully
covered
and
i
not
sure
but
there
should
have
been
a
law
she
broke
when
she
uprooted
these
orchids
much
as
i
love
them
i
doubt
if
i
can
keep
them
alive
and
bring
them
to
bloom
next
season
i
try
but
i
do
possess
flower
magic
in
the
highest
degree
she
turned
the
glass
touching
it
with
questioning
palm
was
it
near
the
warmth
of
bog
water
after
all
was
bog
water
warm
next
time
she
was
in
a
swamp
she
would
plunge
her
hand
deeply
in
the
mosses
to
feel
the
exact
temperature
to
which
those
roots
had
been
accustomed
then
she
spoke
again
yes
i
eliminate
the
squaw
she
said
these
golden
slippers
are
the
swamp
to
me
but
i
see
you
kneeling
to
lift
them
i
am
so
glad
i
the
woman
they
made
you
see
douglas
sat
forward
and
opened
his
lips
was
not
this
the
auspicious
moment
did
the
squaw
bring
more
she
questioned
yes
he
answered
pink
moccasins
in
a
basket
of
red
osiers
with
the
same
moss
rosemary
and
white
tresses
would
you
rather
those
she
set
down
the
glass
drawing
the
basket
toward
her
with
both
hands
as
she
parted
the
mosses
to
drop
in
the
water
she
slowly
shook
her
head
one
must
have
seen
them
to
understand
what
that
would
be
like
she
said
i
know
it
was
beautiful
but
i
sure
i
should
have
selected
the
gold
had
i
been
there
oh
i
wonder
if
the
woman
who
has
the
moccasins
will
give
them
a
drink
and
will
she
try
to
preserve
their
roots
she
will
not
said
douglas
emphatically
how
can
you
possibly
know
queried
the
girl
i
saw
the
man
who
ordered
them
laughed
douglas
oh
cried
leslie
comprehendingly
i
stake
all
i
worth
the
moccasins
are
drooping
against
a
lavender
dress
the
roots
are
in
the
garbage
can
while
the
cook
or
maid
has
the
basket
he
said
douglas
how
can
you
exclaimed
leslie
i
could
positively
could
mine
are
here
the
slow
colour
crept
into
her
cheek
i
make
those
roots
bloom
next
spring
you
shall
see
them
in
perfection
she
promised
that
would
be
wonderful
he
exclaimed
warmly
tell
me
were
there
yet
others
she
asked
hastily
only
these
he
said
but
there
was
something
else
i
came
near
losing
them
while
i
debated
or
rather
while
i
possessed
these
and
worshipped
the
others
there
was
a
gutter
row
that
almost
made
me
lose
yours
in
the
gutter
again
she
laughed
once
again
he
admitted
such
a
little
chap
with
an
appealing
voice
while
his
inflection
was
the
smallest
part
of
what
he
was
saying
kid
come
on
be
square
oh
leslie
why
douglas
the
girl
cried
tell
me
of
all
the
slowness
he
exclaimed
i
let
him
slip
again
let
who
again
questioned
leslie
my
little
brother
answered
he
oh
douglas
you
did
really
she
protested
yes
i
did
he
said
i
heard
a
little
lad
saying
the
things
that
are
in
the
blood
and
bone
of
the
men
money
ca
buy
and
corruption
break
i
heard
him
plead
like
a
lawyer
and
argue
his
case
straight
i
lent
a
hand
when
his
eloquence
failed
got
him
his
deserts
then
let
him
go
i
did
have
an
impulse
to
keep
him
i
did
call
after
him
but
he
disappeared
douglas
we
can
find
him
she
comforted
i
have
found
either
of
the
others
i
realized
i
have
been
interested
in
after
i
let
them
slip
he
answered
while
this
boy
was
both
of
them
rolled
into
one
and
ten
more
like
them
oh
douglas
i
so
sorry
but
maybe
some
other
man
has
already
found
him
said
leslie
no
you
can
always
pick
the
brothered
boys
said
douglas
the
first
thing
that
happens
to
them
is
a
and
better
clothing
then
an
air
of
possessed
importance
no
man
has
attached
this
one
douglas
describe
him
she
commanded
i
watch
for
him
how
did
he
look
what
was
the
trouble
one
at
a
time
cautioned
the
man
he
was
a
little
chap
a
white
clean
threadbare
little
chap
with
such
a
big
voice
so
wonderfully
intoned
and
such
a
bigger
principle
for
which
he
was
fighting
one
of
these
overgrown
newsboys
the
public
wo
stand
for
unless
he
is
in
the
way
when
they
are
making
a
car
had
hired
him
to
sell
his
papers
while
he
loafed
mickey
repeated
leslie
questioningly
the
big
fellow
called
him
no
doubt
a
mother
who
adored
him
named
him
michael
and
thought
him
unto
god
when
she
did
it
the
big
fellow
had
loafed
all
afternoon
when
mickey
came
back
and
turned
over
the
money
and
waited
to
be
paid
off
his
employer
laughed
at
the
boy
for
not
keeping
it
when
he
had
it
mickey
begged
him
be
and
told
him
that
not
business
mind
you
but
the
big
fellow
jeered
at
him
and
was
starting
away
mickey
and
i
reached
him
at
the
same
time
so
i
got
in
the
gutter
again
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
so
slow
i
do
see
how
i
did
it
i
do
either
she
said
with
a
twinkle
that
might
have
referred
to
the
first
of
the
two
exclamations
it
must
be
your
scotch
habit
of
going
slowly
and
surely
but
cheer
up
we
find
him
i
help
you
have
you
reflected
on
the
fact
that
this
city
covers
many
square
miles
of
which
a
fourth
is
outskirts
while
from
them
three
thousand
newsboys
gathered
at
the
last
salvation
army
banquet
for
them
that
where
we
can
find
him
she
cried
thanksgiving
or
christmas
of
course
we
see
him
then
mickey
did
have
a
salvation
army
face
he
said
i
am
sure
he
is
a
free
lance
and
a
rare
one
besides
this
is
may
i
want
my
little
brother
to
go
on
my
vacation
with
me
i
want
him
now
would
it
help
any
if
i
be
a
sister
to
you
not
a
bit
said
douglas
i
do
in
the
very
least
wish
to
consider
you
in
the
light
of
a
sister
you
have
another
place
in
my
heart
very
different
yet
all
your
own
but
i
do
wish
to
make
of
mickey
the
little
brother
i
never
have
had
minturn
was
telling
me
what
a
rejuvenation
he
getting
from
the
boy
he
picked
up
already
he
has
him
in
his
office
and
is
planning
school
and
partnership
with
a
man
he
can
train
as
he
chooses
but
minturn
has
sons
of
his
own
protested
leslie
oh
no
not
in
the
least
exclaimed
douglas
minturn
has
sons
of
his
she
persistently
upsets
and
frustrates
minturn
every
idea
for
them
while
he
is
helpless
you
will
remember
she
has
millions
he
has
what
he
earns
he
ca
separate
his
boys
splendid
physical
little
chaps
from
their
mother
money
and
influence
and
educate
them
to
be
a
help
to
him
they
are
to
be
made
into
men
of
wealth
and
leisure
minturn
will
evolve
his
little
brother
into
a
man
of
brains
and
efficiency
but
minturn
is
a
power
cried
the
girl
not
financially
explained
douglas
nothing
but
money
counts
with
his
wife
in
telling
me
of
this
boy
minturn
confessed
that
he
was
forced
mind
you
to
see
his
sons
ruined
while
he
is
building
a
street
gamin
as
he
would
them
if
permitted
how
sad
douglas
cried
leslie
your
voice
is
bitter
ca
he
do
something
not
a
blooming
thing
answered
douglas
she
has
the
money
she
is
their
mother
her
character
is
unimpeachable
if
minturn
went
to
extremes
the
law
would
give
them
to
her
she
would
turn
them
over
to
ignorant
servants
who
would
corrupt
them
and
be
well
paid
for
doing
it
why
minturn
told
me
but
i
ca
repeat
that
anyway
he
made
me
eager
to
try
my
ideas
on
a
lad
who
would
be
company
for
me
when
i
ca
be
here
and
do
wish
to
be
with
other
men
are
you
still
going
to
those
brotherhood
meetings
i
am
and
i
always
shall
be
nothing
in
life
gives
me
such
big
returns
for
the
time
invested
there
is
a
world
of
talk
breaking
loose
about
the
present
among
women
i
happen
to
know
that
the
is
as
deep
with
men
for
each
woman
i
personally
know
bitten
by
i
know
two
men
in
the
same
condition
as
long
as
men
and
women
are
forced
to
combine
to
uphold
society
it
is
my
idea
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
there
were
to
be
a
sisterhood
organized
then
the
two
societies
frankly
brought
together
and
allowed
to
clear
up
the
differences
between
them
but
why
not
asked
the
girl
eagerly
because
we
are
pursuing
false
ideals
we
have
a
wrong
conception
of
what
is
while
in
answered
the
scotsman
because
the
sexes
except
in
rare
very
rare
instances
do
not
understand
each
other
and
every
day
are
drifting
farther
apart
while
most
of
the
married
folk
i
know
are
farthest
apart
of
all
leslie
what
is
it
in
marriage
that
constrains
people
we
can
talk
argue
and
agree
or
disagree
on
anything
why
ca
the
minturns
from
what
you
say
it
would
seem
to
me
it
her
idea
of
what
is
worth
while
in
life
said
leslie
exactly
cried
douglas
but
he
can
sway
men
he
can
do
powerful
work
he
could
induce
her
to
marry
him
why
ca
he
control
his
own
blood
if
she
should
lose
her
money
and
become
dependent
upon
him
for
support
he
could
said
leslie
he
should
do
it
anyway
insisted
douglas
do
you
think
you
could
she
queried
i
never
thought
myself
in
his
place
said
douglas
but
i
believe
i
will
and
if
i
see
glimmerings
i
suggest
them
to
him
good
boy
said
the
girl
lightly
and
then
she
added
do
you
mind
if
i
think
myself
in
her
place
and
see
if
i
can
suggest
a
possible
point
at
which
she
could
be
reached
i
know
her
i
should
consider
her
happy
at
least
not
with
what
i
call
joy
what
do
you
call
joy
asked
douglas
being
satisfied
with
your
environment
douglas
glanced
at
her
then
at
her
surroundings
and
looking
into
her
eyes
laughed
quizzically
but
if
it
were
different
i
am
perfectly
confident
that
i
should
work
out
joy
from
life
insisted
leslie
it
owes
me
joy
i
have
it
if
i
fight
for
it
leslie
leslie
be
careful
you
are
challenging
providence
stronger
men
than
i
have
wrought
chaos
for
their
children
said
a
warning
voice
as
her
father
came
behind
her
chair
chaos
or
no
still
i
put
up
my
fight
for
joy
daddy
laughed
the
girl
only
see
preciousest
one
minute
said
her
father
shaking
hands
with
douglas
now
what
is
it
leslie
oh
i
do
see
take
my
chair
and
make
friends
said
the
girl
winton
seated
himself
then
began
examining
and
turning
the
basket
indians
he
queried
yes
said
douglas
a
particularly
greasy
squaw
i
wish
i
might
truthfully
report
an
artist
indian
of
the
minnehaha
type
but
alack
it
was
the
same
one
i
seen
ever
since
i
been
in
the
city
and
that
you
seen
for
years
before
my
arrival
winton
still
turned
the
basket
i
bought
their
stuff
for
years
because
neither
leslie
nor
her
mother
ever
would
tolerate
fat
carnations
and
overgrown
roses
so
long
as
i
could
find
a
scrap
of
arbutus
a
violet
or
a
from
the
woods
we
often
motored
up
and
penetrated
the
swamp
i
fancy
these
came
from
for
some
distance
but
later
in
the
season
it
so
very
boggy
now
are
these
rather
wonderful
he
turned
to
his
daughter
perfectly
daddy
she
said
perfectly
but
i
do
mean
for
the
creator
explained
winton
i
am
accustomed
to
his
miracles
every
day
i
see
a
number
of
them
i
mean
for
the
squaw
i
have
to
know
the
squaw
and
understand
her
viewpoint
said
leslie
she
had
it
in
her
tightly
clenched
fist
laughed
douglas
one
sure
anyway
not
over
two
that
has
a
thing
to
do
with
the
with
which
she
made
the
basket
and
filled
it
with
just
three
perfect
plants
said
leslie
you
think
there
is
real
art
in
her
anatomy
queried
winton
bear
witness
o
you
treasures
of
gold
cried
leslie
waving
toward
the
basket
there
was
another
explained
douglas
as
he
again
described
the
osier
basket
winton
nodded
he
looked
at
his
daughter
i
like
to
think
young
woman
that
you
were
born
with
and
i
have
cultivated
what
might
be
called
artistic
taste
in
you
he
said
granted
the
freedom
of
the
tamarack
swamp
could
you
have
done
better
not
so
well
daddy
not
nearly
so
well
i
never
could
have
defaced
what
you
can
see
was
a
noble
big
tree
by
cutting
that
piece
of
bark
while
i
might
have
worshipped
until
dragged
away
but
so
far
as
art
and
i
are
concerned
the
slippers
would
still
be
under
their
tamarack
you
are
begging
the
question
leslie
laughed
her
father
i
was
not
discussing
the
preservation
of
the
wild
i
was
inquiring
into
the
state
of
your
artistic
ability
if
you
had
no
hesitation
about
taking
the
flowers
could
you
have
gone
to
that
swamp
collected
the
material
and
fashioned
and
filled
a
more
beautiful
basket
that
this
how
can
i
tell
daddy
asked
the
girl
there
only
one
way
to
learn
i
forget
my
scruples
you
get
me
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
then
we
drive
to
the
tamarack
swamp
and
experiment
we
do
it
cried
winton
the
very
first
half
day
i
can
spare
we
do
it
and
you
douglas
you
will
want
to
come
with
us
of
course
why
course
laughed
leslie
because
he
started
the
expedition
with
his
golden
slippers
when
it
come
to
putting
my
girl
and
incidentally
my
whole
family
in
competition
with
an
indian
squaw
on
a
question
of
art
naturally
her
father
and
one
of
her
best
friends
would
want
to
be
present
but
maybe
went
alone
and
what
chance
would
her
work
have
with
you
two
for
judges
asked
leslie
we
need
be
the
judges
said
douglas
bruce
quietly
we
can
put
this
basket
in
the
basement
in
a
cool
damp
place
where
it
will
keep
perfectly
for
a
week
when
you
make
your
basket
we
can
find
the
squaw
and
bring
her
down
with
us
lowry
could
display
the
results
side
by
side
he
could
call
up
whomever
you
consider
the
most
artistic
man
and
woman
in
the
city
and
get
their
decision
you
be
willing
to
abide
by
that
would
you
surely
but
it
would
be
fair
to
the
squaw
explained
leslie
have
had
the
benefit
of
her
art
to
begin
on
it
would
said
winton
does
not
every
artist
living
painter
sculptor
writer
what
you
will
have
the
benefit
of
all
art
that
has
gone
before
you
agree
leslie
turned
to
douglas
your
father
argument
is
a
truism
but
i
will
know
that
i
am
on
trial
she
did
is
it
fair
to
her
persisted
leslie
for
begging
the
question
commend
me
to
a
woman
said
winton
the
point
we
began
at
was
not
what
you
could
do
in
a
contest
with
her
she
went
to
the
swamp
and
brought
from
it
some
flower
baskets
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
her
to
suppose
that
they
are
her
best
art
now
what
we
are
proposing
to
test
is
whether
the
finest
product
of
our
civilization
as
embodied
in
you
can
go
to
the
same
swamp
and
from
the
same
location
surpass
her
work
do
i
make
myself
clear
perfectly
clear
daddy
and
it
would
be
fair
conceded
leslie
but
it
is
an
offence
punishable
with
a
heavy
fine
to
peel
a
birch
tree
while
i
would
do
it
if
it
were
not
got
her
to
respect
the
law
anyway
said
winton
to
douglas
the
proposition
leslie
was
not
that
you
do
the
same
thing
but
that
from
the
same
source
you
outdo
her
you
need
use
birch
bark
if
it
involves
your
soul
then
it
all
settled
you
must
hurry
and
take
me
before
the
lovely
plants
have
flowered
said
leslie
i
go
day
after
promised
winton
in
order
to
make
our
plan
work
it
is
necessary
that
i
keep
these
orchids
until
that
time
said
leslie
you
have
a
better
chance
than
the
lady
who
drew
the
osier
basket
has
of
keeping
hers
said
winton
if
i
remember
i
have
seen
the
slippers
in
common
earth
quite
a
distance
from
the
lake
while
the
moccasins
demand
bog
moss
water
and
swamp
mists
and
dampness
i
have
seen
slippers
in
the
woods
myself
said
leslie
i
think
the
conservatory
will
do
so
they
shall
go
there
right
now
i
have
to
be
fair
to
let
me
carry
them
for
you
offered
douglas
arising
us
back
in
a
second
daddy
said
leslie
i
am
interested
excited
and
eager
to
make
the
test
yet
in
a
sense
i
do
not
like
it
but
why
asked
douglas
ca
you
see
countered
leslie
no
said
douglas
it
shifting
my
sense
of
possession
explained
the
girl
the
slippers
are
no
longer
my
beautiful
gift
from
you
they
are
perishable
things
that
belong
to
an
indian
squaw
in
justice
to
her
i
have
to
keep
them
in
perfect
condition
so
that
my
work
may
not
surpass
hers
with
the
unspeakable
art
of
flower
freshness
while
instead
of
thinking
them
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
world
i
will
now
lie
awake
half
the
night
no
doubt
studying
what
i
can
possibly
find
that
is
more
beautiful
douglas
bruce
opened
his
slow
lips
taking
a
step
in
her
direction
dinner
is
served
announced
her
father
he
looked
inquiringly
toward
his
daughter
she
turned
to
douglas
unless
you
have
a
previous
engagement
you
will
dine
with
us
you
she
asked
i
should
be
delighted
he
said
heartily
when
the
meal
was
over
and
they
had
returned
to
the
veranda
leslie
listened
quietly
while
the
men
talked
most
of
the
time
but
when
she
did
speak
what
she
said
proved
that
she
always
had
listened
to
and
taken
part
in
the
discussions
of
men
until
she
understood
and
could
speak
of
business
or
politics
intelligently
have
you
ever
considered
an
official
position
douglas
inquired
winton
i
have
an
office
within
my
gift
or
so
nearly
so
that
i
can
control
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
be
a
good
man
surely
we
could
work
together
in
harmony
it
never
has
appealed
to
me
that
i
wanted
work
of
that
nature
answered
douglas
it
unusually
kind
of
you
to
think
of
me
and
make
the
offer
but
i
am
satisfied
with
what
i
am
doing
while
there
is
a
steady
increase
in
my
business
that
gives
me
confidence
what
your
objection
to
office
asked
winton
that
it
takes
your
time
from
your
work
answered
douglas
that
it
changes
the
nature
of
your
work
that
if
you
let
the
leaders
of
a
party
secure
you
a
nomination
and
the
party
elect
you
you
are
bound
to
their
principles
at
least
there
is
a
tacit
understanding
that
you
are
and
if
you
should
happen
to
be
afflicted
with
principles
of
your
own
then
you
have
got
to
sacrifice
them
is
a
good
word
in
this
instance
said
winton
it
is
painful
to
a
man
of
experience
to
see
you
young
fellows
of
such
great
promise
come
up
and
yourself
half
to
death
the
of
established
business
parties
and
customs
but
half
of
you
do
it
in
the
end
all
of
you
come
limping
in
poor
disheartened
defeated
and
then
swing
to
the
other
extreme
by
being
so
willing
for
a
change
you
take
almost
anything
and
so
the
dirty
jobs
naturally
fall
to
you
i
grant
much
of
that
douglas
said
in
his
deliberate
way
but
happily
i
have
sufficient
annual
income
from
my
father
estate
to
enable
me
to
live
until
i
become
acquainted
in
a
strange
city
and
have
time
to
establish
the
kind
of
business
i
should
care
to
handle
i
am
thinking
of
practising
corporation
law
i
specialized
in
that
so
i
may
have
the
pleasure
before
so
very
long
of
going
after
some
of
the
men
who
do
what
you
so
aptly
term
the
jobs
a
repetition
of
the
customary
chorus
said
winton
differing
only
in
that
it
is
a
little
more
emphatic
than
usual
i
predict
that
you
will
become
an
having
party
affiliations
inside
ten
years
possibly
said
douglas
but
i
promise
you
this
it
will
be
a
new
office
no
man
ever
before
has
held
in
the
gift
of
a
party
not
now
in
existence
oh
you
dreamers
cried
winton
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
is
to
be
young
and
setting
out
to
reform
the
world
especially
on
a
permanent
income
that
where
you
surpass
most
reformers
but
i
said
nothing
about
reform
corrected
douglas
i
said
i
was
thinking
of
corporation
law
i
accustomed
to
it
while
you
would
scare
leslie
if
you
said
remarked
winton
she
a
reformer
herself
you
know
but
only
child
labour
civic
improvement
preservation
of
the
wild
and
things
like
that
cried
leslie
so
quickly
and
eagerly
that
both
men
laughed
god
be
praised
exclaimed
her
father
god
be
praised
echoed
her
lover
before
she
retired
leslie
visited
the
slippers
i
like
to
know
she
said
softly
as
she
touched
a
bronze
striped
calyx
i
like
to
know
how
i
am
to
penetrate
your
location
and
find
and
fashion
anything
to
outdo
you
and
the
squaw
you
wood
creatures
you
then
she
bent
above
the
flowers
and
whispered
tuck
this
in
the
toe
of
your
slipper
three
times
it
was
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
tongue
but
his
slowness
let
the
moment
pass
i
can
a
for
my
scotsman
i
can
bide
forever
if
i
must
for
it
he
only
and
no
other
the
moccasins
soon
had
been
ground
to
pulp
and
carried
away
on
a
tire
while
at
three
in
the
morning
a
cross
dishevelled
society
woman
in
passing
from
her
dressing
room
to
her
bed
stumbled
over
the
osier
basket
kicking
it
from
her
way
chapter
iii
mickey
his
responsibility
weighing
upon
him
slept
lightly
and
awakened
early
his
first
thought
of
peaches
he
slipped
into
his
clothing
and
advancing
peered
at
her
through
the
grayness
his
heart
beat
wildly
aw
you
poor
kid
you
poor
little
kid
he
whispered
to
himself
as
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
doing
for
company
the
scaring
the
jolting
the
scouring
and
everything
were
too
much
for
you
gone
sure
you
just
like
them
at
the
morgue
aw
peaches
i
mean
to
hurt
you
peaches
i
was
to
be
good
to
you
honest
i
was
peaches
aw
as
his
fright
increased
mickey
raised
his
voice
until
his
last
wail
reached
the
consciousness
of
the
sleeping
child
she
stirred
slightly
her
head
moving
on
the
pillow
mickey
almost
fell
so
great
was
his
relief
he
stepped
closer
gazing
in
awe
the
sheared
hair
had
dried
in
the
night
tumbling
into
a
hundred
golden
ringlets
the
tiny
clean
face
was
white
so
white
that
the
blue
of
the
closed
eyes
showed
darkly
through
the
lids
the
blue
veins
streaked
the
temples
and
the
little
claws
lying
relaxed
on
the
sheet
mickey
slowly
broke
up
inside
a
big
hard
lump
grew
in
his
throat
he
shut
his
lips
tight
and
bored
the
tears
from
his
eyes
with
his
wiry
fists
he
began
to
mutter
his
thoughts
to
regain
gee
kid
but
you
had
me
scared
to
the
limit
he
said
i
thought
you
were
gone
sure
honest
i
did
ai
i
glad
though
but
you
the
whitest
thing
you
like
i
tell
you
what
you
like
like
the
lily
flowers
in
the
store
windows
at
easter
you
white
like
them
and
your
hair
is
the
little
bit
of
gold
decorating
them
if
known
it
was
like
that

to
time
to

on

stand
it
if
i
was
to
hurt

before
the
cars
or
jump
down
an
elevator
hole

i
would
trade
you
for
the
smartest
dog
that

nor
the
trees
nor

glanced
at
the
sky
clearing
from
the
graying

up
to
him

wonderful
no
cursing

over
a

to

mickey
named
her
for
the
wonderful
flower
like
granny

picked
up
before
a
church
one
day
a
few
weeks
ago
and
in
a
rare
sober
moment
had
carried
to
her
mickey
had
made
her
feel
clean
so
rested
and
so
fresh
she
wanted
to
roll
over
the
bed
with
child
impulse
she
put
up
her
arms
mickey
stooped
to
them
you
goin
to

you
going

she
paused
in
a
deep
study
to
think
of
a
word
anywhere
nearly
adequate
then
ended
in
a
burst
that
was
her
best
emanation
lovest
she
hugged
him
closely
then
lifted
her
chin
and
pursed
her
lips
mickey
pulled
back
a
dull
colour
in
his
face
now
nix
on
the
mushing
he
said
i

a
hug
once
a

far
back
as
he
could

over
and
swept
the
hair
from
his
forehead
which
he
brought
in
range
of
her
lips
he
had
to
brace
himself
to
keep
from
flinching
at
their
cold
touch
and
straightened
in
relief

trifle
at

pillow

said
mickey
then
i
get
my
own
if
you

he
laid
the
pillow
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
saying
politely
me
lily
till
i
get
a
bottle
of
milk
soon
he
returned
and
with
his
first
glimpse
of
the
bed
stood
aghast
it
was
empty
his
eyes
searched
the
room
his
pallet
on
the
floor
outlined
a
tiny
form
a
dismayed
half
smile
flashed
over
his
face
he
took
a
step
toward
her
and
then
turned
getting
out
a
cloth
he
had
not
used
since
being
alone
near
the
bed
he
set
the
table
and
laid
a
plate
knife
fork
and
spoon
because
he
was
watching
peaches
he
soon
discovered
she
was
peeking
out
at
him
so
he
paid
strict
attention
to
the
burner
he
was
lighting
then
he
sliced
bread
put
on
a
toaster
set
the
milk
on
the
table
broke
an
egg
in
a
saucer
and
turned
the
toast
soon
the
odours
filled
the
room
also
a
pitiful
sound
mickey
knew
peaches
must
have
hurt
herself
sliding
from
the
bed
although
her
arms
were
strong
for
the
remainder
of
her
body
she
had
no
way
to
reach
his
pallet
but
to
roll
across
the
floor
she
might
have
bruised
herself
badly
he
was
amazed
disgusted
yet
compassionate
he
went
to
her
and
turned
back
the
comfort
you
must
be
speaking
a
little
louder
lily
he
said
gently
i
quite
hearing
you
only
muffled
sobbing
mickey
dropped
the
cover
i
want
my
breakfast
said
a
very
small
voice
you
mean
please
my
breakfast
he
corrected
gently
oh
i
hurt
myself
so
peaches
wailed
oh
mickey
i
fell
an
broke
my
back
clear
in
two
like
rollin
off
my
rags
oh
mickey
it
so
to
the
floor
from
your
bed
oh
mickey
even
another
girl
back
or
yours
or
a
dog
or
anybody
would
fix
it
now
it
hurt
for
days
mickey
why
did
i
ever
oh
what
made
me
please
please
put
me
back
on
the
nice
fine
bed
an
do
please
give
me
some
of
that
bread
mickey
lifted
her
crooning
incoherent
things
he
wiped
her
face
and
hands
combed
her
hair
and
pushed
the
table
against
the
bed
he
broke
toast
in
a
glass
and
poured
milk
over
it
then
he
cooked
the
egg
and
gave
her
that
keeping
only
half
the
milk
and
one
slice
of
bread
he
made
a
sandwich
of
more
bread
and
the
cheese
put
a
banana
with
it
set
a
cup
of
water
in
reach
and
told
her
that
was
her
lunch
to
eat
it
when
the
noon
whistles
blew
then
he
laid
all
the
picture
books
he
had
on
the
back
of
the
bed
put
the
money
for
his
papers
in
his
pocket
and
locking
her
in
ran
down
sunrise
alley
fast
as
he
could
he
was
one
hour
late
he
had
missed
two
regular
customers
they
must
be
made
up
and
more
light
air
cleanliness
and
kindness
would
increase
peaches
appetite
which
seemed
big
now
for
the
size
of
her
body
mickey
face
was
very
sober
when
he
allowed
himself
to
think
of
his
undertaking
how
would
he
make
it
he
had
her
now
he
simply
must
succeed
the
day
was
half
over
before
mickey
began
to
laugh
for
no
apparent
reason
he
had
realized
that
she
had
not
said
what
he
had
required
of
her
after
all
gee
i
up
against
it
said
mickey
i
did
she
act
like
that
i
thought
she
keep
on
being
like
when
she
woke
up
i
never
behaved
like
that
then
in
swift
remorse
but
i
had
the
finest
mother
a
fellow
ever
had
to
tell
me
while
she
ai
had
any
one
and
only
got
me
now
so
have
to
tell
her
course
i
ca
do
everything
at
once
so
far
as
that
goes
she
did
do
any
worse
than
the
millyingaires
kids
in
the
park
who
roll
themselves
in
the
dirt
bump
their
own
heads
and
scream
and
fight
i
guess
my
kid
no
worse
than
other
people
i
can
train
her
like
mother
did
me
then
we
be
enough
alike
we
can
live
together
and
even
when
she
was
the
worst
i
liked
her
i
liked
her
cartloads
so
mickey
shouldered
the
duties
of
paternity
and
began
thinking
for
his
child
his
little
neglected
bad
sick
child
his
wits
and
feet
always
had
been
nimble
that
day
he
excelled
himself
anxiety
as
to
how
much
he
must
carry
home
at
night
to
replace
what
he
had
spent
in
moving
peaches
to
his
room
three
extra
meals
to
provide
before
night
something
to
interest
her
through
the
long
day
it
was
a
contract
surely
mickey
faced
it
gravely
but
he
did
not
flinch
he
did
not
know
how
it
was
to
be
done
but
he
did
know
it
must
be
done
her
they
should
not
whatever
it
had
been
his
mother
had
feared
for
him
nameless
though
the
horror
was
from
he
must
save
lily
mickey
had
thought
it
must
be
careless
nurses
or
lack
of
love
yesterday
papers
had
said
there
were
some
children
at
one
of
the
homes
no
one
ever
visited
they
were
sick
for
love
would
not
some
kind
people
come
to
see
them
it
must
have
been
she
feared
he
could
not
possibly
know
it
was
the
stigma
of
having
been
a
charity
child
she
had
been
combating
with
all
her
power
they
had
not
got
him
they
must
not
get
his
lily
yet
stirrings
in
mickey
brain
told
him
he
was
not
going
to
be
sufficient
alone
there
were
emergencies
he
did
not
know
how
to
manage
he
must
have
help
mickey
revolved
the
problem
in
his
worried
head
without
reaching
a
solution
his
necessity
drove
him
he
darted
dodged
and
took
chances
far
down
the
street
he
selected
his
victim
and
studied
his
method
of
assault
as
he
approached
for
mickey
did
victimize
people
that
day
he
sold
them
papers
when
they
did
not
want
them
he
bettered
that
and
sold
them
papers
when
they
had
them
he
snatched
up
lost
papers
smoothed
and
sold
them
over
every
gay
picture
or
broken
toy
dropped
from
an
automobile
he
caught
up
and
pocketed
for
her
a
woman
stumbled
alighting
from
a
passing
car
mickey
dropped
his
papers
and
sprang
forward
her
weight
bore
him
to
the
pavement
but
he
kept
her
from
falling
and
even
as
he
felt
her
on
her
feet
he
snatched
under
the
wheels
for
her
purse
is
that
all
your
stuff
lady
he
asked
thank
you
i
think
so
she
said
wait
a
minute
to
lend
help
was
an
hourly
occurrence
with
mickey
had
been
most
particular
to
teach
him
that
he
was
gathering
up
and
smoothing
his
papers
several
of
which
were
soiled
the
woman
opened
the
purse
he
had
rescued
taking
therefrom
a
bill
which
she
offered
him

care
of

herself
mickey
backed
away
swallowing
a
big
lump
in
his
throat
and
blinking
down
angry
tears
he
said
i
asked
god
to
help
me
and
for
a
minute
i
was
so
glad
i
thought
he
helped
by

white
wonderful
jesus
at
the
cathedral
door
holding

little

arms
so
loving

he
stopped
to
ask
whether
it
was
a
girl
or
a
boy
he
took
it
up
he
just
opened
his
arms
to
the
first

mickey
wheeled
vanishing
it
was
a
wonderful
exhibition
of
curves
leaps
and
darts
he
paused
for
breath
when
he
felt
safe
so
that
the
dope
he
marvelled
i
ca
take
care
of
a
girl
going
to
take
her
away
from
me
i
like
to
know
men
all
the
time

care
of
women
i
see
boys
taking
care
of
girls
i
know
their
mothers

every
day
i

to
know
mother
said
i
was
to
take
care
of
she
said
that

made

care
of
her
was
why
she
was
glad
my
father
was
i
guess
i
know
what
i
doing
but
i
learned
something
nix
on
the
easy
talk
after
this
and
telling
anybody
you
meet
all
you
know
shut
mouth
from
now
on
your
name
little
boy
carnegie
live
on
the
hudson
a
mouth
just
tight
shut
about
lily
after
this
and
nix
on
the
swell
dames
next
one
can
bust
her
crust
for
all
i
care
i
wo
touch
her
on
the
instant
precisely
that
thing
occurred
at
mickey
very
feet
with
his
lips
not
yet
closed
he
knelt
to
shove
his
papers
under
a
woman
head
then
went
racing
up
the
stone
steps
she
had
rolled
down
his
quick
eye
catching
and
avoiding
the
bit
of
fruit
on
which
she
had
slipped
he
returned
in
a
second
with
help
as
the
porter
lifted
the
inert
body
mickey
slid
his
hands
under
her
head
and
advised
keep
her
straight
into
one
of
the
big
hospitals
he
helped
carry
a
blue
and
white
clad
nurse
on
and
on
up
elevators
and
into
a
white
porcelain
room
where
they
laid
her
on
a
glass
table
mickey
watched
with
frightened
eyes
doctors
and
nurses
came
running
he
stood
waiting
for
his
papers
he
was
rather
sick
yet
he
remembered
he
had
five
there
he
must
sell
better
clear
out
of
here
now
suggested
a
surgeon
my
papers
said
mickey
she
fell
right
cross
my
feet
i
slid
them
under
to
make
her
head
more
pillowlike
on
the
stones
maybe
i
can
sell
some
of
them
the
surgeon
motioned
to
a
nurse
at
the
door
take
this
youngster
to
the
office
and
pay
him
for
the
papers
he
has
spoiled
he
ordered
will
she
is
she
going
to
wavered
mickey
i
not
sure
said
the
surgeon
from
the
bleeding
probably
concussion
but
she
will
live
do
you
know
how
she
came
to
fall
there
was
a
smear
of
something
on
the
steps
she
did
see
explained
mickey
thank
you
go
with
the
nurse
said
the
surgeon
then
to
an
attendant
take
miss
alden
number
and
see
to
her
case
she
was
going
after
something
mickey
turned
back
paper
maybe
he
suggested
pointing
to
her
closed
hand
the
surgeon
opened
it
and
found
a
nickel
he
handed
it
to
mickey
if
you
have
a
clean
one
left
let
this
nurse
take
it
to
miss
alden
case
and
say
she
has
been
assigned
other
duty
see
to
sending
a
substitute
at
once
every
paper
proved
to
be
marked
i
can
bring
you
a
fresh
one
in
a
second
lady
offered
mickey
i
got
the
money
all
right
she
said
wait
with
it
in
the
office
and
then
i
pay
you
i
sent
for
a
paper
i
to
be
let
in
as
soon
as
i
get
it
announced
mickey
to
the
porter
i
ai
taking
chances
of
being
turned
down
he
said
to
himself
as
he
stopped
a
second
to
clean
the
step
he
returned
and
was
waiting
when
the
nurse
came
she
was
young
and
fair
faced
her
hair
was
golden
and
as
she
paid
mickey
for
his
papers
he
wondered
how
soon
he
could
have
lily
looking
like
her
he
took
one
long
survey
as
he
pocketed
the
money
thinking
he
would
rush
home
at
once
but
he
wanted
to
fix
in
his
mind
how
lily
must
appear
to
be
right
for
he
thought
a
nurse
in
the
hospital
would
be
right
the
nurse
knew
she
was
beautiful
and
to
her
mickey
long
look
was
tribute
male
tribute
a
small
male
indeed
but
such
a
winning
one
so
she
took
the
occasion
to
be
her
loveliest
and
smile
her
most
attractive
smile
mickey
surrendered
he
thought
she
was
like
an
angel
that
made
him
think
of
heaven
heaven
made
him
think
of
god
god
made
him
think
of
his
call
for
help
that
morning
the
call
made
him
think
of
the
answer
the
beautiful
woman
before
him
made
him
think
that
possibly
might
be
the
answer
instead
of
the
other
one
he
rather
doubted
it
but
it
might
be
a
chance
mickey
was
alert
for
chances
for
peaches
so
he
smiled
again
then
he
asked
are
you
in
such
an
awful
hurry
i
think
we
owe
you
more
than
merely
paying
for
your
papers
she
said
what
is
it
again
mickey
showed
how
long
and
how
wide
lily
was
and
with
hair
like
yours
and
eyes
and
cheeks
that
would
be
if
she
had
her
chance
and
nobody
to
give
her
that
chance
but
just
me
he
said
me
and
lily
are
all
each
other
got
he
explained
hastily
we
folks
a
family
we
do
want
no
bunching
in
corps
and
squads
we
nix
on
the
orphings
home
business
but
you
would
you
oh
would
you
tell
me
just
how
i
should
be
taking
care
of
her
i
doing
everything
like
my
mother
did
to
me
but
i
was
well
and
strong
maybe
lily
being
a
girl
should
have
things
different
so
beautiful
as
you
would
tell
me
would
you
then
a
miracle
happened
the
nurse
so
clean
she
smelled
like
a
drug
store
so
lovely
she
shone
as
a
sunrise
laid
an
arm
across
shoulders
you
come
with
me
she
said
she
went
to
a
little
room
and
all
alone
she
asked
mickey
questions
with
his
eyes
straight
on
hers
he
answered
she
told
him
surely
he
could
take
care
of
lily
she
explained
how
she
rang
for
a
basket
and
packed
it
full
of
things
he
must
have
showing
him
how
to
use
them
she
told
him
to
come
each
saturday
at
four
as
she
was
going
off
duty
and
tell
her
how
he
was
getting
along
she
gave
him
a
thermometer
and
told
him
how
to
learn
if
the
child
had
fever
she
told
him
about
food
and
she
put
in
an
ointment
instructing
him
to
rub
the
little
back
with
it
so
the
bed
would
not
be
so
tiresome
she
showed
him
how
to
arrange
the
pillows
when
he
left
the
tears
were
rolling
down
mickey
cheeks
both
of
them
were
so
touched
she
laid
her
arm
across
his
shoulder
again
and
went
as
far
as
the
elevator
while
a
passport
to
her
at
any
time
was
in
his
pocket
i
other
folks
tell
you
you
are
beautiful
like
flowers
or
music
or
colours
said
mickey
in
farewell
but
you
look
like
a
window
in
heaven
to
me
and
i
can
see
right
through
you
to
god
and
all
the
beautiful
angels
but
what
gets
me
is
why
the
other
one
had
to
bust
her
crust
to
make
you
come
true
the
nurse
was
laughing
and
wiping
her
eyes
at
the
same
time
mickey
gripped
the
basket
until
his
hands
were
stiff
as
he
sped
homeward
at
least
two
hours
early
and
happy
about
it
at
the
last
grocery
he
remembered
every
word
and
bought
bread
milk
and
fruit
with
care
for
a
sick
lady
he
explained
so
the
grocer
who
knew
him
used
care
triumphing
mickey
climbed
the
stairs
he
paused
a
second
in
deep
thought
at
the
foot
of
the
last
flight
then
ascended
whistling
to
let
peaches
know
that
he
was
coming
then
on
his
threshold
recited
a
little
kid
named
lily
was
so
sweet
she
knock
you
silly
yellow
hair
in
millying
curls
beat
a
mile
all
other
she
was
on
his
bed
she
was
on
his
pillow
she
had
been
lonely
both
arms
were
stretched
toward
him
mickey
hurry
she
cried
mickey
lem
me
hold
you
i
sure
mickey
all
day
i
did
hardly
durst
breathe
fear
the
door
open
they
me
oh
mickey
you
wo
let
them
will
you
mickey
dropped
his
bundles
and
ran
to
the
bed
this
time
he
did
not
shrink
from
her
wavering
clasp
it
was
delight
to
come
home
to
something
alive
something
that
belonged
to
him
something
to
share
with
something
to
work
and
think
for
something
that
depended
upon
him
now
nix
on
the
scare
talk
he
comforted
forget
it
i
lived
here
three
years
alone
and
not
a
single
time
has
anybody
come
to
me
so
they
wo
you
there
only
one
thing
can
happen
us
if
i
get
sick
or
spend
too
much
on
eating
and
do
pay
the
rent
the
man
that
owns
this
building
will
fire
us
out
if
we
mickey
repeated
impressively
pay
our
rent
regular
in
advance
nobody
will
come
not
so
do
worry
then
what
all
them
bundles
fretted
peaches
you
ort
so
much
you
never
get
the
rent
paid
they
me
sure
now
throttle
your
engine
advised
mickey
stop
your
car
smash
down
on
the
brakes
they
are
things
the
city
you
reside
in
furnishes
its
taxpayers
or
something
like
that
i
pay
my
rent
so
this
is
my
and
it
things
for
you
to
make
you
comfortable
which
are
you
worst
tiredest
or
hungriest
or

know
she
said
then
i
make
a
clean
said
mickey
washing
is
cooling
and
it
freshens
you
up
a
lot
so
mickey
brought
his
basin
again
bathing
the
tired
child
gently
as
any
woman
could
have
done
it
see
what
i
got
he
cried
as
he
opened
bundles
and
explained
going
to
see
if
you
have
fever
peaches
rebelled
at
the
thermometer
now
come
on
in
urged
mickey
slide
straight
home
to
your
base
if
i
going
to
take
care
of
you
i
going
to
right
you
ca
lay
here
eating
wrong
things
if
you
have
you
do
get
to
see

any
more
of
these
bundles
nor
any
supper

and
taking
both
her
hands
he
held

mickey

then
began
softly
rubbing
it
into
the
dreadful
back
his
face
was
drawn
with
anxiety
and
filled
with
horror
he
was
afraid
but
the
nurse
said
this
he
should
do
while
first
lesson
had
been
implicit
obedience
so
he
rubbed
gently
as
he
was
fearful
when
peaches
made
no
complaint
a
little
stronger
and
a
little
stronger
until
he
was
tired
then
he
covered
her
telling
her
to
lie
on
it
and
see
how
it
felt
peaches
looked
at
him
with
wondering
eyes

what
queried
mickey
a
little
kid
named
lily
prompted
peaches
mickey
laughed
and
obeyed
neatly
he
put
away
all
that
had
been
supplied
him
before
lighting
the
burner
he
gave
lily
a
drink
of
milk
and
tried
arranging
both
pillows
to
prop
her
up
as
he
had
been
shown
when
the
water
boiled
he
dropped
in
two
bouillon
cubes
the
nurse
had
given
him
and
set
out
some
crackers
he
had
bought
he
put
the
milk
in
two
cups
and
when
he
cut
the
bread
he
carefully
collected
every
crumb
putting
it
on
the
sill
in
the
hope
that
a
bird
might
come
the
thieving
sparrows
used
to
watching
windows
and
stealing
from
stores
set
out
to
cool
were
soon
there
peaches
to
whom
anything
with
feathers
was
a
bird
was
filled
with
joy
the
odour
of
the
broth
was
delicious
mickey
danced
turned
handsprings
and
made
the
funniest
remarks
then
he
fixed
the
bowl
on
a
paper
broke
the
crackers
in
her
broth
growing
unspeakably
happy
at
her
delight
as
she
tasted
it
every
saturday

mickey
stopped
short
he
had
started
to
say
go
to
the
parks
but
if
other
ladies
were
like
the
first
one
he
had
talked
with
and
if

she
said
the
law

not
let

to
take
her
where
people

susceptible
to
poison
vines
i
have
handled
anything
wild
as
i
pleased
all
my
life
she
said
i
am
sure
there
is
no
danger
from
that
source
but
douglas
did
you
ever
hear
of
or
see
a
massasauga
you
are
perfectly
safe
on
that
score
he
said
i

lingered
on
the
borders

be
my
initiation
by
night
i
have
learned
the
state
of
my
artistic
ability
with
natural
resources
and
i
know
whether
the
heart
of
the
swamp
is
the
loveliest
sight
i
ever
have
seen
and
i
will
have
proved
how
i
up
with
a
leslie
i
now
reading
a
most
interesting
human
document
said
douglas
and
in
it
i
have
reached
the
place
where
indians
in
the
heart
of
terrific
winter
killed
and
heaped
up
a
pile
of
deer
in
early
day
in
minnesota
then
went
to
camp
rejoicing
while
their
squaws
were
left
to
walk
miles
and
each
carry
back
on
her
shoulder
a
deer
frozen
stiff
leslie
you
do
line
up
you
are
not
expected
to
do
you
believe
that
douglas
asked
the
girl
it
history

not
fiction
he
answered
douglas
she
warned
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon
that
was
a
slip
cried
he
oh
she
breathed
leslie
will

do
something
for
me
he
questioned
what
she
retorted
listen
with
one
ear
stop
the
other
and
tell
me
what
you
hear
he
ordered
yes
she
said
did
you
hear
leslie
he
asked
anxiously
i
heard
something
i
do
know
what
she
answered
can
you
describe
it
leslie
just
a
rushing
beating
sound
what
is
it
douglas
my
heart
leslie
sending
to
you
each
throbbing
stroke
of
my
manhood
pouring
out
its
love

the
astonished
girl

leslie
begged
the
man

said

want
to
hear
what
my
heart
has
to
say
to
you
he
asked
not
over
a
wire
not
so
far
away
she
panted
then
i
shorten
the
distance
i
coming
leslie
what
shall
i
do
she
gasped
she
stared
around
her
trying
to
decide
whether
she
should
follow
her
impulse
to
hide
when
her
father
entered
the
room
daddy
she
cried
if
you
want
to
be

to

a
little
while

somewhere
a
few
minutes
and
stay
until

bruce
entered
rushing
to
leslie
he
caught
her
to
his
breast
roughly
while
with
a
strong
hand
he
pressed
her
ear
against
his
heart
now
you
listen
my
girl
he
cried
you
listen
at
close
range
leslie
remained
quiet
a
long
second
then
she
lifted
her
face
adorable
misty
eyed
and
tenderly
smiling
douglas
i
never
listened
to
a
heart
before
how

for

early
the
next
morning
they
inspected
their
equipment
carefully
then
drove
north
to
the
tamarack
swamp
where
they
arranged
that
leslie
and
douglas
were
to
hunt
material
while
winton
and
the
driver
went
to
the
nearest
indian
settlement
to
find
the
squaw
who
had
made
the
other
basket
and
bring
her
to
the
swamp
if
you
have
experienced
the
same
emotions
you
will
know
how
douglas
and
leslie
felt
when
hand
in
hand
they
entered
the
swamp
on
a
perfect
morning
in
late
may
if
you
have
not
mere
words
are
inadequate
through
fern
and
brake
head
high
through
sumac
willow
elder
buttonbush
and
osiers
past
northern
holly
over
spongy
moss
carpet
of
palest
silvery
green
for
ages
over
pitcher
plants
spilling
their
fullness
among
scraggy
odorous
tamaracks
beneath
which
cranberries
and
rosemary
were
blooming
through
ethereal
pale
mists
of
dawn
in
their
ears
lark
songs
of
morning
from
the
fields
hermit
thrushes
in
the
swamp
bell
birds
tolling
molten
notes
in
a
minor
strain
a
swelling
chorus
of
sparrows
titmice
warblers
vireos
went
two
strong
healthy
young
people
newly
promised
for
better
or
worse
they
could
only
look
stammer
flush
and
utter
broken
exclamations
all
about
better
they
could
not
remotely
conceive
that
life
might
serve
them
the
cruel
trick
of
worse
leslie
sank
to
her
knees
douglas
lifted
her
up
set
her
on
the
firmest
location
he
could
see
adoring
her
with
his
eyes
and
reverent
touch
since
that
first
rough
grasp
as
he
drew
her
to
him
leslie
had
felt
positively
fragile
in
his
hands
she
smiled
at
him
her
most
beautiful
smile
when
with
emotion
douglas
why
just
now
when
you
waited
two
years
she
asked
wanted
a
degree
of
success
to
offer
he
answered
leslie
disdained
the
need
for
success
wanted
you
to
have
time
to
know
me
as
completely
as
possible
leslie
intimated
that
she
could
learn
faster
wanted
to
have
the
acknowledged
right
to
put
my
body
between
yours
and
any
danger
this
swamp
might
have
to
offer
exactly
what
i
thought
cried
she
wise
girl
commented
the
man
douglas
i
must
hurry
said
leslie
it
may
take
a
long
time
to
find
the
flowers
i
want
while
i
no
idea
what
i
shall
do
for
a
basket
i
saw
osiers
yellow
and
red
in
quantities
but
where
are
the
orchids
we
must
make
our
way
farther
in
and
search
he
said
douglas
listen
breathed
leslie
i
hear
exquisite
music
he
answered
but
do
you
recognize
it
she
cried
it
does
seem
familiar
but
i
am
not
sufficiently
schooled
in
music
the
girl
began
softly
to
whistle
by
jove
cried
the
man
what
is
that
leslie
di
provenza
from
traviata
she
answered
but
i
must
stop
listening
for
birds
douglas
when
i
can
scarcely
watch
for
flowers
or
vines
i
have
to
keep
all
the
time
looking
to
make
sure
that
you
are
really
my
man
and
i
that
you
are
my
woman
leslie
that
expression
and
this
location
the
fact
that
you
are
in
competition
with
a
squaw
and
the
indian
talk
we
have
indulged
in
lately
all
conspire
to
remind
me
that
a
few
days
ago
while
i
was
still
a
myself
i
read
a
poem
called
of
the
search
that
was
the
biggest
thing
of
its
kind
that
i
have
yet
found
in
our
language
it
was
so
great
that
i
reread
it
until
i
am
sure
i
can
do
it
justice
listen
my
of
morning
my
of
song
douglas
stood
straight
as
the
tamaracks
his
feet
sinking
in
the
little
moss
while
from
his
heart
he
quoted
constance
wonderful
poem
descend
through
the
forest
alone
are
the
willows
stark
and
in
the
warm
sudden
grasp
of
spring
like
a
woman
when
her
lover
has
suddenly
swiftly
taken
her
i
hear
the
secret
rustle
of
little
leaves
waiting
to
be
born
the
air
is
a
wind
of
love
from
the
wings
of
eagles
mating
o
eagles
my
sky
is
dark
with
your
wings
the
hills
and
the
waters
pity
me
the
reproach
me
the
little
moss
whispers
under
my
feet
son
of
earth
brother
why
comest
thou
hither
alone
oh
the
wolf
has
his
mate
on
the
mountain
where
art
thou
i
tremble
with
love
as
reeds
by
the
river
i
burn
as
the
dusk
in
the
west
i
call
thee
aloud
as
the
deer
calls
the
doe
i
await
thee
as
hills
wait
the
morning
i
desire
thee
as
eagles
the
storm
i
yearn
to
thy
breast
as
night
to
the
sea
i
claim
thee
as
the
silence
claims
the
stars
o
earth
earth
great
earth
mate
of
god
and
mother
of
me
say
where
is
she
the
bearer
of
morning
my
bringer
of
song
love
in
me
waits
to
be
born
where
is
she
the
woman
is
she
the
woman
the
answer
is
of
morning
of
song
i
adore
you
oh
douglas
how
beautiful
cried
leslie
my
man
can
we
think
of
anything
save
ourselves
can
we
make
that
basket
it
would
be
a
bad
start
to
give
up
our
first
undertaking
together
he
said
of
course
she
cried
we
must
we
simply
must
find
things
father
may
call
any
minute
let
go
my
hand
and
follow
behind
me
keep
close
douglas
i
should
go
before
to
clear
the
way
he
suggested
no
i
may
miss
rare
flowers
if
you
do
she
objected
go
slowly
so
i
can
watch
before
and
overhead
yes
she
answered
there
there
douglas
ah
there
they
are
he
exulted
but
i
ca
take
them
she
protested
only
a
few
leslie
look
before
you
see
how
many
there
are
he
said
douglas
could
there
be
more
wonderful
flowers
than
the
moccasins
and
slippers
she
asked
scarcely
more
wonderful
there
might
be
more
delicate
and
lovely
farther
let
us
go
farther
she
urged
her
cry
closed
the
man
arms
around
her
then
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
small
open
space
breathlessly
worshipping
but
it
was
the
almighty
they
were
now
adoring
here
the
moss
lay
in
a
flat
carpet
tinted
deeper
green
water
willow
rolled
its
ragged
hoops
with
swelling
bloom
and
leaf
buds
overflowing
pitcher
plants
grew
in
irregular
beds
on
slender
stems
lifting
high
their
flat
buds
but
scattered
in
groups
here
and
there
sometimes
with
massed
similar
colours
sometimes
in
clumps
and
variegated
patches
stood
the
rare
early
fringed
orchis
some
almost
white
others
pale
lavender
and
again
the
deeper
colour
of
the
moccasins
while
everywhere
on
stems
some
a
foot
high
nodded
the
exquisite
lavender
and
white
showy
orchis
count
he
commanded
leslie
pointed
a
slender
finger
indicating
each
as
she
spoke
one
two
three
under
the
sweep
of
your
arms
douglas
and
more
more
by
the
hundred
surely
if
we
are
careful
not
to
kill
them
the
lord
wo
mind
if
we
take
out
a
few
for
people
to
see
will
he
he
must
have
made
them
to
be
seen
said
douglas
and
worshipped
cried
the
girl
douglas
why
did
the
squaw
asked
leslie
maybe
she
did
come
this
far
he
said
perhaps
she
knows
by
experience
that
these
are
too
fragile
to
remove
you
may
not
be
able
to
handle
them
leslie
i
going
to
try
she
said
but
first
i
must
make
my
basket
go
back
to
the
osiers
to
weave
it
and
then
come
here
to
fill
it
oh
douglas
did
you
ever
see
such
flower
perfection
in
all
your
life
only
in
books
in
my
home
country
applied
botany
is
a
part
of
every
man
education
i
never
have
seen
ragged
or
fringed
orchids
growing
before
i
have
read
of
many
fruitless
searches
for
the
white
ones
so
have
i
they
seem
to
be
the
rarest
douglas
look
there
there
was
a
group
of
bloom
made
by
years
of
spreading
from
one
root
until
above
the
rank
moss
and
beneath
the
dark
tamarack
branch
the
picture
appeared
inconceivably
delicate
yes
the
most
exquisite
flowers
i
ever
have
seen
and
there
douglas
she
pointed
to
another
group
just
the
shade
of
the
lavender
on
the
toe
of
the
moccasin
and
in
a
great
ragged
mass
would
any
one
believe
it
not
without
seeing
it
he
said
emphatically
and
there
douglas
exactly
the
colour
of
the
moccasins
see
that
cluster
there
are
no
words
douglas
shall
you
go
farther
he
asked
no
she
answered
i
going
back
to
weave
my
basket
there
is
nothing
to
surpass
the
orchids
in
rarity
and
wondrous
beauty
good
he
cried
i
go
ahead
and
you
follow
so
they
returned
to
the
osiers
leslie
pondered
deeply
a
few
seconds
then
resolutely
putting
douglas
aside
she
began
cutting
armloads
of
pale
yellow
osiers
finding
a
suitable
place
to
work
she
swiftly
and
deftly
selected
perfect
straight
evenly
coloured
ones
cutting
them
the
same
length
then
binding
the
tip
ends
firmly
with
raffia
she
had
brought
to
substitute
for
grass
then
with
fine
slips
she
began
weaving
gradually
spreading
the
twigs
while
inwardly
giving
thanks
for
the
lessons
she
had
taken
in
basketry
at
last
she
held
up
a
big
pointed
yellow
basket
ready
she
said
beautiful
cried
douglas
leslie
carefully
lined
the
basket
with
moss
in
which
the
flowers
grew
working
the
heads
between
the
open
spaces
she
had
left
she
bent
three
twigs
dividing
her
basket
top
in
exact
thirds
one
of
these
she
filled
with
the
whitest
one
with
stronger
and
one
with
the
deepest
lavender
placing
the
tallest
plants
in
the
centre
so
that
the
outside
ones
would
show
completely
then
she
lifted
by
the
root
exquisite
showy
orchis
the
tiniest
plants
she
could
select
and
set
them
around
the
edge
she
bedded
the
roots
in
the
basket
and
began
bordering
the
rim
and
entwining
the
handle
with
a
delicate
vine
she
looked
up
at
douglas
her
face
thrilled
with
triumph
flushed
with
exertion
her
eyes
humid
with
feeling
while
he
gazed
at
her
stirred
to
the
depth
of
his
heart
with
sympathy
and
the
wonder
of
possession
of
morning
you
win
he
cried
triumphantly
there
is
no
use
going
farther
let
me
carry
that
to
your
father
and
he
too
will
say
so
i
have
a
reason
for
working
out
our
plan
she
said
yes
may
i
know
he
asked
surely
she
answered
you
remember
what
you
told
me
about
the
minturns
i
ca
live
in
a
city
and
not
have
my
feelings
harrowed
every
day
and
while
i
like
to
change
everything
wrong
i
know
i
ca
all
of
it
so
what
i
ca
cope
with
must
be
put
aside
but
this
refuses
it
is
insistent
when
you
really
think
of
it
that
is
so
douglas
if
they
once
felt
what
we
do
now
could
it
go
there
must
be
something
left
you
mention
him
oftener
than
any
other
one
man
so
you
must
admire
him
deeply
i
know
her
as
well
as
any
woman
i
meet
in
society
better
than
most
i
had
thought
of
asking
them
to
be
the
judges
she
is
interested
in
music
and
art
it
would
please
her
and
be
perfectly
natural
for
me
to
ask
her
you
are
on
intimate
terms
with
him
from
your
offices
being
opposite
there
could
be
no
suspicion
of
any
ulterior
motive
in
having
them
i
do
know
that
it
would
accomplish
anything
but
it
would
let
them
know
to
begin
with
that
we
consider
them
friends
so
it
would
be
natural
for
them
to
come
with
us
if
we
ca
manage
more
than
that
it
will
give
us
ground
to
try
again
splendid
he
said
a
splendid
plan
it
would
let
them
see
that
at
least
our
part
of
the
world
thinks
of
them
together
and
expects
them
to
be
friends
splendid
i
have
finished
said
leslie
i
quite
agree
answered
douglas
no
one
could
do
better
that
is
the
ultimate
beauty
of
the
swamp
made
manifest
there
is
the
horn
your
father
is
waiting
a
surprise
was
also
waiting
winton
had
not
only
found
the
squaw
who
brought
the
first
basket
but
he
had
made
her
understand
so
thoroughly
what
was
wanted
that
she
had
come
with
him
while
at
his
suggestion
she
had
replaced
the
moccasin
basket
as
exactly
as
she
could
and
also
made
an
effort
at
decoration
she
was
smiling
woodenly
when
leslie
and
douglas
approached
but
as
leslie
father
glimpsed
and
cried
out
over
her
basket
the
squaw
frowned
drawing
back
where
you
find
she
demanded
in
the
swamp
leslie
nodded
backward
the
squaw
grunted
disapprovingly
lowry
no
buy
sell
slipper
sell
moccasin
no
sell
weed
leslie
looked
with
shining
eyes
at
her
father
that
lies
with
lowry
he
said
i
drive
you
there
and
bring
you
back
and
you
have
the
ride
and
the
money
for
your
basket
all
that
concerns
you
we
wo
come
here
to
make
any
more
the
squaw
smiled
again
so
they
started
to
the
city
they
drove
straight
to
the
winton
residence
for
the
slippers
while
winton
and
the
squaw
went
to
take
the
baskets
to
lowry
and
leave
douglas
at
his
office
leslie
in
his
car
went
to
minturn
do
think
i
crazy
laughed
leslie
as
minturn
came
down
to
meet
her
i
want
to
use
your
exquisite
taste
and
art
instinct
a
few
minutes
please
do
come
with
me

question
up

the
wonderful
stuff

indians

down
from
the
swamps
to
sell
on
the
streets
and
to
the
florists
indeed
yes
i
often
buy
of
them
in
the
spring
i
love
the
wild
white
violets
especially
what
is
it
you
want
why
you
see
said
leslie
looking
eagerly
at
minturn
you
see
there
are
three
flower
baskets
at
lowry
douglas
bruce
is
going
to
buy
me
the
one
i
want
most
for
a
present
to
celebrate
a
very
important
occasion
and
i
ca
tell
which
is
most
artistic
i
want
you
to
decide
your
judgment
is
so
unfailing
will
you
come
only
a
little
spin
leslie
you
are
by
any
chance
asking
me
to
select
your
betrothal
gift

you
leslie
face
was
smiling
wonderment
she
had
hastily
slipped
off
her
swamp
costume
joy
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
imperishable
shone
on
her
brightly
illumined
face
with
tightly
closed
lips
she
vigorously
nodded
the
elder
woman
bent
to
kiss
her
of
course
i
come
she
laughed
i
feel
thrilled
and
flattered
and
i
congratulate
you
sincerely
bruce
is
a
fine
man
he
make
a
big
fortune
soon
oh
i
hope
not
said
leslie
are
you
crazy
demanded
minturn
you
said
you
did
want
me
to
think
you
so
you
see
said
leslie
bruce
has
a
living
income
so
have
i
from
my
mother
fortunes
seem
to
me
to
work
more
trouble
than
they
do
good
i
believe
poor
folks
are
happiest
they
get
most
out
of
life
and
after
all
what
gives
deep
joy
is
the
thing
to
live
for
it
but
we
must
hurry
lowry
did
promise
to
hold
the
flowers
long
i
be
ready
in
a
minute
but
i
see
where
douglas
bruce
is
giving
you
wrong
ideas
said
minturn
he
needs
a
good
talking
to
money
is
the
only
thing
worth
while
and
the
comfort
and
the
pleasure
it
brings
without
it
you
are
crippled
handicapped
a
slave
crawling
while
others
step
over
you
i
convince
back
in
a
minute
when
minturn
returned
she
was
in
a
delightful
mood
her
face
eager
her
dress
beautiful
leslie
wondered
if
this
woman
ever
had
known
a
care
then
remembered
that
not
long
before
she
had
lost
a
little
daughter
leslie
explained
as
they
went
swiftly
through
the
streets
you
wo
mind
waiting
only
a
second
until
i
run
up
to
offices
she
asked
he
was
ready
so
together
they
stopped
at
minturn
door
douglas
whispered
watch

office
boy

is
minturn
little
brother

told

about
leslie
nodded
and
entered
gaily
please

minturn
if
he
will
see
miss
winton
and
douglas
bruce
a
minute
she
said
an
alert
lad

politely
laid
aside
a
book
and
entered
the
inner
office
now
let
me
said
leslie

she
cried
positively
enchanting

that
forbidding

face

a
few
minutes
maying

you
much

asked
minturn
retaining
the
hand
leslie
offered
him
as
he
turned
to
douglas
bruce
you
must
ask
miss
winton
he
said
minturn
eyes
questioned
her
sparkling
face
while
again
with
closed
lips
she
nodded
my
most
earnest
congratulations
to
each
of
you
may
life
grant
you
even
more
than
you
hope
for
and
from
your
faces
that
is
no
small
wish
to
make
for
you
surely
i
come
what
is
it
you
have
planned
something
lovely

leslie
at
lowry

three
flower
baskets
that
are
rather
bewildering
i
am
to
have
one
for
my
betrothal
gift
but
i
ca
decide
i
appealed
to
minturn
to
help
me
and
she
agreed
she
is
waiting
below
bruce
named
you
for
him
so
you
two
and
lowry
are
to
choose
the
most
artistic
basket
for
me
then
if
i
do
agree
i
need
take
it
but
i
want
to
see
what
you
think
you
come
of
course
minturn
face
darkened
at
the
mention
of
his
wife
while
he
hesitated
and
looked
penetratingly
at
leslie
she
was
guileless
charming
and
eager
very
well
minturn
said
gravely
i
surprised
but
also
pleased
beautiful
young
ladies
have
not
appealed
to
me
so
often
of
late
that
i
can
afford
to
miss
the
chance
of
humouring
the
most
charming
of
her
sex
how
lovely
laughed
leslie
douglas
did
you
ever
know
minturn
could
flatter
like
that
it
most
enjoyable
i
shall
insist
on
more
of
it
at
every
opportunity
really
minturn
society
has
missed
you
of
late
and
it
is
our
loss
we
need
men
who
are
worth
while
now
it
is
you
who
flatter
smiled
minturn
see
my
captive
cried
leslie
as
she
emerged
from
the
building
and
crossed
the
walk
to
the
car
bruce
and
minturn
are
great
friends
so
as
we
passed
his
door
we
brought
him
along
by
force
it
certainly
would
require
that
to
bring
him
anywhere
in
my
company
said
minturn
coldly
the
shock
of
the
cruelty
of
the
remark
closed
douglas
lips
but
it
was
leslie
day
to
bubble
so
she
resolutely
set
herself
to
heal
and
cover
the
hurt
i
think
business
is
a
perfect
bugbear
she
said
as
she
entered
the
car
i
going
to
have
a
agreement
as
to
just
how
far
work
may
trespass
on
douglas
time
and
how
much
belongs
to
me
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
daddy
and
i
always
have
had
lovely
times
together
and
i
would
call
him
successful
would
you
a
fine
business
man
said
minturn
heartily
you
could
have
had
much
greater
advantages
if
he
had
made
more
money
said
minturn
the
advantage
of
more
money
yes
retorted
leslie
quickly
but
would
the
money
have
been
of
more
advantage
to
me
than
the
benefits
of
his
society
and
his
personal
hand
in
my
rearing
i
think
not
i
prefer
my
daddy
when
you
take
your
place
in
society
as
the
mistress
of
a
home
you
will
find
that
millions
will
not
be
too
much
said
minturn
if
i
had
millions
i
give
most
of
them
away
and
just
go
on
living
about
as
i
do
now
with
daddy
said
leslie
leslie
where
did
you
get
bitten
with
this
awful
common
what
kind
of
an
idea
shall
i
call
it
you
have
imbibed
socialistic
tendencies
have
you
have
a
smattering
of
what
they
mean
laughed
leslie
the
scare
me
completely
just
ideas
are
all
i
have
thinking
home
better
than
any
other
place
on
earth
the
way
you
can
afford
to
have
it
merely
being
human
kind
and
interested
in
what
my
men
are
doing
and
enjoying
and
helping
any
one
who
crosses
my
path
and
seems
to
need
me
oh
i
get
such
joy
such
delicious
from
life
if
i
were
undertaking
reform
i
sell
my
car
and
walk
and
do
settlement
work
said
minturn
scornfully
then
leslie
surprised
all
of
them
she
leaned
forward
looked
beamingly
into
the
elder
woman
face
and
cried
enthusiastically
i
am
positive
you
be
stronger
and
much
happier
if
you
would
you
know
there
is
no
greater
fun
than
going
to
the
end
of
the
car
line
and
then
walking
miles
into
the
country
especially
now
in
you
see
sights
no
painter
ever
transferred
even
a
good
imitation
of
to
canvas
you
hear
music
i
wish
every
music
lover
with
your
trained
ear
could
have
spent
an
hour
in
that
swamp
this
morning
you
soon
know
where
verdi
and
strauss
found
some
of
their
loveliest
themes
and
where
beethoven
got
the
bird
notes
for
the
brook
scene
of
the
pastoral
symphony
think
how
interested
you
be
in
a
yellow
and
black
bird
singing
the
spinning
song
from
martha
while
you
could
accuse
the
bird
of
having
stolen
it
from
flotow
could
you
surely
the
bird
holds
right
of
priority
if
you
were
a
little
fool
and
talking
purposely
to
irritate
me
you
almost
cause
me
to
ask
if
you
seriously
mean
that
said
minturn
why
laughed
leslie
determined
not
to
become
provoked
on
this
her
great
day
that
is
a
matter
you
can
test
for
yourself
if
you
a
score
of
martha
get
one
and
i
take
you
where
you
can
hear
a
bird
sing
that
strain
then
you
may
judge
for
yourself
i
do
believe
it
said
minturn
tersely
but
if
it
were
true
that
would
be
the
wonderful
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
it
would
cost
you
only
ten
cents
scored
leslie
you
ride
beyond
the
end
of
the
car
line
for
that
while
a
woman
who
can
dance
all
night
surely
could
far
enough
to
reach
any
old
orchard
that
what
i
am
trying
to
you
money
in
large
quantities
is
necessary
to
provide
the
things
in
the
world
while
millions
do
bring
happiness
i
can
find
more
in
what
you
would
class
almost
poverty
why
do
you
try
it
suggested
minturn
but
i
said
leslie
and
i
enjoy
it
i
could
go
with
a
man
i
love
as
i
do
daddy
and
make
a
home
and
get
joy
i
never
have
found
in
society
from
just
what
we
two
could
do
with
our
own
hands
in
the
woods
i
do
like
a
city
if
daddy
business
did
keep
him
here
i
would
be
in
the
country
this
minute
look
at
us
poor
souls
trying
to
find
pleasure
in
a
basket
from
the
swamp
when
we
might
have
the
whole
swamp
i
be
happy
to
live
at
its
door
now
try
a
basket
full
of
it
there
are
three
you
are
to
examine
each
of
them
carefully
then
write
on
a
slip
of
paper
which
you
think
the
you
are
not
to
say
things
that
will
influence
each
other
decisions
or
lowry
i
want
a
straight
opinion
from
each
of
you
they
entered
the
florist
and
on
a
glass
table
faced
the
orchids
the
slippers
the
fringed
basket
and
the
moccasins
winton
and
the
squaw
were
waiting
while
the
florist
was
smiling
in
gratification
but
the
minturns
went
to
the
flowers
without
a
word
they
simply
stood
and
looked
each
of
the
baskets
was
in
perfect
condition
the
flowers
were
as
fresh
as
at
home
in
the
swamp
each
was
a
thing
of
wondrous
beauty
each
deserved
the
mute
tribute
it
was
exacting
minturn
studied
them
with
gradually
darkening
face
minturn
repeatedly
opened
her
lips
as
if
she
would
speak
but
did
not
she
stepped
closer
and
gently
turned
the
flowers
and
lightly
touched
the
petals
beautiful
she
said
at
last
beautiful
another
long
silence
then
leslie
did
you
hear
a
bird
sing
that
strain
from
martha
yes
said
leslie
i
did
and
if
you
will
go
with
me
to
the
swamp
where
those
flowers
came
from
you
shall
hear
one
sing
a
strain
that
will
instantly
remind
you
of
the
opening
chorus
while
another
renders
di
provenza
il
mar
from
traviata
the
lady
turned
again
to
the
flowers
she
was
thinking
something
deep
and
absorbing
but
no
one
could
have
guessed
exactly
what
it
might
be
finally
i
have
decided
she
said
shall
we
number
these
one
two
and
three
and
so
indicate
them
yes
said
leslie
a
little
breathlessly
put
your
initials
to
the
slips
and
i
read
them
offered
douglas
then
he
smilingly
read
aloud
lowry
one
minturn
two
minturn
three
i
cast
the
deciding
vote
cried
leslie
one
the
squaw
seemed
to
think
of
a
but
decided
against
it
now
be
good
enough
to
state
your
reasons
said
winton
do
you
prefer
the
slipper
basket
mr
lowry
it
satisfies
my
sense
of
the
artistic
why
the
fringed
basket
mrs
minturn
because
it
contains
daintier
more
wonderful
flowers
than
the
others
and
is
by
far
the
most
pleasing
production
now
minturn
your
turn
why
do
you
like
the
moccasin
basket
it
makes
the
deepest
appeal
to
me
he
answered
but
why
persisted
winton
if
you
will
have
it
the
moccasins
are
the
colour
i
once
loved
on
the
face
of
my
little
daughter
now
leslie
said
winton
hurriedly
as
he
noted
displeased
look
must
i
tell
she
asked
yes
said
her
father
douglas
selected
it
for
me
so
i
like
it
best
but
leslie
cried
douglas
there
were
only
two
baskets
when
i
favoured
that
had
the
fringed
orchids
been
here
then
i
most
certainly
should
have
chosen
them
i
think
yours
far
the
most
exquisite
i
claim
it
now
will
you
give
it
to
me
surely
i
love
to
laughed
the
girl
you
have
done
your
most
exquisite
work
on
the
fringed
basket
said
minturn
to
the
squaw
no
make
said
she
promptly
pointing
to
leslie
leslie
winton
did
you
go
to
the
swamp
to
make
that
basket
demanded
minturn
yes
answered
leslie
did
you
make
all
of
them
only
that
one
replied
leslie
why
marvelled
the
lady
to
see
if
i
could
go
to
the
tamarack
swamp
and
bring
from
it
with
the
same
tools
and
material
a
more
artistic
production
than
an
indian
woman
well
you
have
conceded
minturn
the
majority
is
against
me
said
leslie
majorities
mean
masses
and
masses
are
notoriously
insane
said
minturn
but
this
is
a
small
select
majority
said
leslie
craziest
of
all
said
minturn
decidedly
if
you
have
finished
with
us
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
these
and
leslie
some
day
i
really
think
i
shall
try
that
bird
music
the
idea
interests
me
more
than
anything
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
if
it
were
true
it
would
indeed
be
wonderful
it
would
be
a
new
experience
if
you
want
to
hear
for
yourself
make
it
soon
because
now
is
nesting
time
not
again
until
next
spring
will
the
music
be
so
entrancing
i
can
go
any
day
i
look
over
my
engagements
and
call
you
if
one
ever
had
a
minute
to
spare
another
of
the
joys
of
wealth
said
leslie
only
the
poor
can
afford
to
and
invite
their
souls
the
flowers
you
will
see
will
delight
your
eyes
quite
as
much
as
the
music
your
ears
i
doubt
your
logic
but
i
try
the
birds
are
you
coming
mr
minturn
not
unless
you
especially
wish
me
are
these
for
sale
he
asked
picking
up
the
moccasins
only
those
replied
the
florist
send
your
bill
he
said
turning
with
the
basket
how
shining
a
thing
is
consistency
sneered
his
wife
you
condemn
the
riches
you
never
have
been
able
to
amass
but
at
the
same
time
spend
like
a
millionaire
i
never
said
i
was
not
able
to
gain
millions
replied
minturn
coldly
i
have
had
frequent
opportunities
i
merely
refused
them
because
i
did
not
consider
them
legitimate
as
for
my
method
in
buying
flowers
in
this
one
instance
price
does
not
matter
you
can
guess
what
i
shall
do
with
them
i
could
possibly
answered
minturn
the
only
sure
venture
i
could
make
is
that
they
will
not
by
any
chance
come
to
me
no
these
go
to
baby
elizabeth
he
said
do
you
want
to
come
with
me
to
take
them
to
her
with
an
audible
sneer
she
passed
him
he
stepped
aside
gravely
raising
his
hat
while
the
others
said
to
him
and
followed
positively
insufferable
cried
minturn
every
one
of
my
friends
say
they
do
not
know
how
i
endure
his
insults
and
i
certainly
will
not
many
more
i
do
i
really
do
know
what
he
expects
winton
and
douglas
bruce
were
confused
while
leslie
was
frightened
but
she
tried
turning
the
distressing
occurrence
off
with
excuses
of
course
he
intended
no
insult
she
soothed
he
must
have
adored
his
little
daughter
and
the
flowers
reminded
him
i
am
so
much
obliged
for
your
opinion
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
take
you
to
the
swamp
any
time
your
little
sons
would
they
like
to
go
it
is
a
most
interesting
and
instructive
place
for
children
for
heaven
sake
do
mention
children
cried
minturn
they
are
a
bother
and
a
curse
oh
mrs
minturn
exclaimed
leslie
of
course
i
do
mean
that
but
i
do
very
near
mine
are
perfect
little
devils
all
the
trouble
james
and
i
ever
had
came
through
them
his
idea
of
a
mother
is
a
combined
doctor
and
nursery
maid
while
i
must
say
i
far
from
agree
with
him
what
are
servants
for
if
not
to
take
the
trouble
of
children
off
your
hands
leslie
was
glad
to
reach
the
rich
woman
door
and
deposit
her
there
as
the
car
sped
away
the
girl
turned
a
despairing
face
toward
douglas
for
the
love
of
moike
she
cried
is
that
shocking
poor
mr
minturn
i
do
pity
him
half
so
much
as
i
do
her
he
answered
what
must
a
woman
have
suffered
or
been
through
to
warp
twist
and
harden
her
like
that
society
life
answered
leslie
as
it
is
lived
by
people
of
wealth
who
are
aping
royalty
and
the
titled
classes
a
branch
of
them
possibly
conceded
douglas
i
know
some
titled
and
wealthy
people
who
would
be
dumbfounded
over
that
woman
ideas
so
do
i
said
leslie
of
course
there
are
exceptions
sometimes
the
exception
becomes
bigger
than
the
rule
but
not
in
our
richest
society
douglas
let
keep
close
together
oh
do
let
ever
drift
into
such
a
state
as
that
i
should
have
asked
them
to
lunch
but
i
could
if
that
is
the
way
she
is
talking
before
her
friends
surely
she
have
many
soon
then
her
need
for
a
real
woman
like
you
will
be
all
the
greater
answered
douglas
i
suppose
you
should
have
asked
her
but
delighted
that
you
did
began
so
nearly
perfect
i
want
to
end
it
with
only
you
and
your
father
will
he
resent
me
leslie
it
all
depends
on
us
if
we
are
selfish
and
leave
him
alone
he
will
feel
it
if
we
can
make
him
realize
gain
instead
of
loss
he
will
be
happier
than
he
is
now
i
wish
i
had
felt
obliged
to
reject
his
offer
the
other
night
very
sorry
about
it
i
not
said
leslie
you
have
a
right
to
live
your
life
in
your
own
way
i
have
seen
enough
of
running
for
office
elections
and
appointments
that
i
hate
it
you
do
the
work
you
educated
yourself
for
and
i
help
you
then
my
success
is
assured
laughed
douglas
leslie
may
i
leave
my
basket
here
will
you
care
for
it
like
yours
and
may
i
come
to
see
it
often
no
you
may
come
to
see
me
and
look
at
the
basket
incidentally
she
answered
do
you
think
minturn
will
go
to
the
swamp
to
listen
to
those
birds
he
asked
eventually
she
will
answered
the
girl
i
may
have
to
begin
by
taking
her
to
an
orchard
to
hear
a
bird
of
gold
sing
a
golden
song
about
and
mending
and
baby
tending
to
start
on
but
when
she
hears
that
she
will
be
eager
for
more
how
interesting
cried
douglas
of
morning
sing
that
song
to
me
now
leslie
whistled
the
air
beating
time
with
her
hand
then
sang
the
words
can
wash
sir
i
can
spin
sir
i
can
sew
and
mend
and
babies
oh
you
of
song
exulted
douglas
i
rather
hear
you
sing
that
than
any
bird
but
from
what
she
said
nellie
minturn
wo
care
particularly
for
it
she
may
not
approve
of
or
practise
the
sentiment
said
leslie
but
she
love
the
music
and
possibly
the
musician
chapter
v
now
what
am
i
going
to
do
yet
to
make
the
day
shorter
lily
asked
mickey
i
guess
i
got
everything
she
answered
there
my
lunch
here
my
pictures
to
cut
here
my
lesson
to
learn
there
my
sky
and
bird
crumbs
mickey
sometimes
they
hop
right
in
on
the
sheet
one
tried
to
get
my
lunch
ai
they
sassy
yes
said
mickey
they
fight
worse
than
rich
folks
i
do
know
why
the
almighty
pays
attention
if
they
fall
mebby
nobody
else
cares
said
peaches
and
he
feels
obliged
to
he

suggested
peaches
well
we

one
consoling
thing

mickey
if

any
of
them
he
made
us
and
if
he
did
make
us
he
did
none
of
them
everybody
comes
in
and
goes
out
the
same
way
she
said
so
then
of
course
it
so
agreed
peaches
that
gives
us
as
good
a
chance
as
anybody
course
it
does
if
we
got
sense
to
take
it
said
mickey
we
got
to
wake
up
and
make
something
of
ourselves
let
me
see
if
you
know
your
lesson
for
yet
there
is
the
picture
of
the
animal
there
is
the
word
that
spells
its
name
now
what
is
it
milk
answered
peaches
her
eyes
mischievous
mickey
held
over
the
book
chuckling
all
right
there
is
the
word
for
that
too
for
being
so
smart
miss
chicken
you
can
learn
it
you
get
any
more
to
drink
if
i
have
good
luck
i
going
to
blow
in
about
six
with
a
slate
and
pencil
for
you
and
then
you
can
print
the
words

peaches
i

to
the

all
the

mickey
where
there

and

and

cried
peaches
sooner

the
sooner
i
get
my
next
verse
i
want
just
norful
good
one
she
held
up
her
arms
mickey
submitted
to
a
hug
and
a
little
cold
dab
on
his
forehead
counted
his
money
locked
the
door
and
ran
on
the
car
he
sat
in
deep
thought
then
suddenly
sniggered
aloud
he
had
achieved
the
next
installment
of
the
doggerel
to
which
every
night
peaches
insisted
on
having
a
new
verse
added
as
he
entered
he
secured
his
papers
and
glimpsing
the
headlines
started
on
his
beat
crying
them
lustily
mickey
knew
that
washing
better
air
enough
food
and
oil
rubbing
were
improving
peaches
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
adding
the
interest
of
her
presence
to
his
life
even
though
it
made
his
work
heavier
was
showing
on
him
he
actually
seemed
bigger
stronger
and
his
face
brighter
and
fuller
he
swung
down
the
street
thrusting
his
papers
right
and
left
crossed
and
went
up
the
other
side
watching
closely
for
a
customer
it
was
ten
and
opportunities
with
the
men
were
almost
over
mickey
turned
to
scan
the
street
for
anything
even
suggesting
a
sale
he
saw
none
and
started
with
his
old
cry
watching
as
he
went
i
to
sell
papers
i
sell
them
sometimes
i
then
he
saw
her
she
was
so
fresh
and
joyous

a
beautiful
slate
small
so
it
would
not

her
bits
of
hands
and
its
frame
was
covered
with
red
his
face
sobered
his
voice
changed
taking
on
unexpected
modulations

in
a
firm
grip
looking
intently
into
his
face
just
by
the
merest
chance

asked

minute
she
said
she
stepped
to
the
inside
of
the
walk

her
purse
wrote
a
line
on
a
card
slipped
it
in
an
envelope
addressed
it
and
handed
it
to
mickey
you
can
read
that
she
asked
i
read
worse
writing
than

he
assured
her
you
ought
to
see
the
hieroglyphics
some
of
the
dames
put
up
mickey
took
a
last
glimpse
at
the
laughing
face
then
wheeling
ran
presently
he
went
into
a
big
building
studied
the
address
board
then
entered
the
elevator
and
following
a
corridor
reached
the
number
he
paused
a
second
glancing
around
when
he
saw
the
name
on
the
opposite
door
a
flash
passed
over
his
face
ugh
he
muttered
now
been
to
this
place
before
glad
she
ai
sending
a
letter
to
man
he
stepped
inside
the
open
door
before
him
crossed
the
room
and
laid
the
note
near
a
man
who
was
bending
over
some
papers
on
a
desk
the
man
reached
a
groping
hand
tore
open
the
envelope
taking
therefrom
a
card
on
which
was
pencilled
could
this
by
any
chance
be
your
little
brother
he
turned
hastily
glancing
at
mickey
then
in
a
continuous
movement
arose
with
outstretched
hand
why
little
brother
he
cried
i
so
glad
to
see
you
mickey
smile
slowly
vanished
as
he
whipped
his
hands
behind
him
stepping
back
nothin
doing
boss
he
said

off
your
trolley

mickey
but

the
next
question
selling
papers

the
answer
trying
to
be
a
corporation
lawyer
explained
douglas

slow

a
start
i
often

more
time
to
spare
than
i
wish
i
had
while
i
lonesome
no

your
mother

asked
mickey
solicitously
yes

douglas

a
good
one
the
very
finest
mickey
said
douglas

mister
said
mickey
with
conviction
well
since
we
are
both
motherless
and
lonesome

suggested
douglas
mickey
shook
his
head
no
questioned
douglas
what
the
use
cried
mickey
you
could
help
me
with
my
work
and
share
my
play
while
possibly
i
could
be
of
benefit
to
you
i
just
wondered
if
you
was
getting
to
that
commented
mickey
getting
to
what
inquired
douglas
going
to
do
me
good
explained
mickey
the
swell
stiffs

always
going
to
do
us
fellows
good
mostly
they
do
they
do
us
good
and
brown
they
pick
us
up
a
while
and
make
lap
dogs
of
us
then
when
we
lost
our
appetites
for
our
jobs
and
got
to
having
a
hankerin
for
the
fetch
and
carry
business
away
they
go
and
forget
us
so
we
a
lot
worse
off
than
we
were
before
some
of
the
fellows
come
out
of
it
knowing
more
ways
to
be
mean
than
they
ever
learned
on
the
street
explained
mickey
if
it
that
big
brother
bee
you
got
in
your
bonnet
pull
its
stinger
and
let
it
die
an
unnatural
death
nope
none
mickey
wait
cried
douglas
me
business
calls
an
i
must
go
to
my
ranch
in
idaho
gaily
sang
mickey
i
like
to
shake
you
said
douglas
bruce
well
go
on
said
mickey
i
here
and
you
big
enough
if
i
thought
it
would
jolt
out
your
fool
notions
and
shake
some
sense
in
i
would
said
douglas
indignantly
now
look
here
kitchener
said
mickey
did
i
say
one
word
that
so
and
that
you
do
know
is
so
what
you
said
is
not
even
half
a
truth
young
man
i
do
know
cases
where
idle
rich
men
have
tried
the
little
brother
plan
as
a
fad
and
made
a
failure
of
it
but
for
a
few
like
that
i
know
dozens
of
sincere
educated
men
who
are
honestly
giving
a
boy
they
fancy
a
chance
i
can
take
you
into
the
office
of
one
of
the
most
influential
men
in
this
city
right
across
the
hall
there
and
show
you
a
boy
he
liked
who
has
in
a
short
time
become
his
friend
an
invaluable
helper
and
hourly
companion
and
out
of
it
that
boy
will
get
a
fine
education
good
business
training
and
a
start
in
life
that
will
give
him
a
better
chance
to
begin
on
than
the
man
who
is
helping
him
had
mickey
laughed
boisterously
then
sobered
suddenly
me
brother
he
said
politely
but
that
most
for
any
use
once
i
took
a
whirl
with
that
gentleman
myself
whether
he
does
or
not
i
know
the
place
where
he
ought
to
get
off
see
answer
me
this
why
would
he
be
spending
money
and
taking
all
that
time
for
a
when
he
hardly
knows
his
own
kids
if
he
sees
them
and
the
wickedest
little
rippers
in
the
park
just
now
douglas
bruce
closed
the
door
then
he
came
back
and
placing
a
chair
for
mickey
he
took
one
opposite
sit
down
mickey
he
said
patiently
there
a
reason
for
my
being
particularly
interested
in
james
minturn
and
the
reason
hinges
on
the
fact
you
mention
that
he
ca
control
his
own
sons
yet
can
make
a
boy
he
takes
comfort
in
of
a
street
gamin
mickey
eyes
narrowed
while
he
sat
very
straight
in
the
chair
he
had
accepted
if
he
made
so
much
of
him
it
sort
of
proves
that
he
a
gamin
some
of
the
boys
are
a
long
shot
closer
gentlemen
than
the
guys
who
are
experimenting
with
them
they
were
born
rich
and
can
afford
it
if
your
friend
going
to
train
his
to
be
what
is
then
that
boy
would
stand
a
better
chance
on
his
own
side
the
curb
see
i
been
right
up
against
that
gentleman
with
the
documents
so
i
know
him
also
her
gee
up
de
choild
and
gim
me
de
papers
was
meant
for
a
joke
but
i
saw
that
lady
and
gentleman
do
it
see
and
she
was
the
prettiest
little
pink
and
yellow
thing
lord
i
can
see
her
gasping
and
blinking
now
makes
me
sick
if
the
boy
across
the
hall
had
seen
what
i
did
he
run
a
mile
and
never
stop
gee
douglas
bruce
stared
aghast
at
last
he
said
slowly
mickey
you
are
getting
mighty
close
the
very
thing
i
wish
to
know
if
i
tell
you
what
i
know
of
james
minturn
will
you
tell
me
what
you
know
and
think
sure
said
mickey
readily
i
got
no
reasons
for
loving
him
i
would
convoy
a
millying
to
the
mint
for
that
gentleman
mickey
shall
i
go
first
or
will
you
i
will
replied
mickey
instantly
when
i
finish
you
save
your
breath
see
i
see
said
douglas
bruce
proceed
well
was
over
two
years
ago
said
mickey
leaning
forward
to
look
bruce
in
the
eyes
i
had
been
up
against
the
game
so
awful
long
alone
was
summer
and
my
papers
were
all
gone
and
i
was
tired
so
i
went
over
in
the
park
and
sat
on
a
seat
just
watching
folks
pretty
soon
comes
walking
a
nice
lady
with
a
sweet
voice
and
kind
eyes
she
sat
down
close
me
and
says
a
nice
day
we
got
when
right
up
at
the
fountain
before
us
stops
as
swell
an
automobile
as
there
is
one
of
the
brown
with
the
hatchet
face
got
out
and
unloaded
three
kids
two
boys
and
a
girl
she
told
the
kids
if
they
did
sit
on
the
benches
she
socked
them
on
hard
and
keep
their
clothes
clean
so
she
would
have
to
wash
and
dress
them
again
that
day
she
knock
the
livers
out
of
them
and
walked
off
with
the
entrance
policeman
soon
as
she
and
bobbie
got
interested
the
kids
began
sliding
off
the
bench
and
running
around
the
fountain
the
girl
was
only
two
or
three
a
fat
toddly
thing
trying
to
do
what
her
brothers
did
and
taking
it
like
the
gamest
kid
you
ever
saw
when
they
pushed
her
off
the
seat
and
tripped
her
and
her
like
a
dog
me
and
the
woman
were
getting
madder
every
minute
tell
your
nurse
says
she
but
the
baby
thing
just
glanced
where
nurse
was
and
kind
of
shivered
and
laughed
and
ran
on
round
the
fountain
when
the
big
boy
stuck
his
foot
out
so
she
fell
nursie
saw
and
started
for
her
but
she
scrambled
up
and
went
kiting
for
the
bench
and
climbed
on
it
so
nurse
told
her
she
cut
the
blood
out
of
her
if
she
did
that
again
then
went
back
to
her
policeman
soon
as
she
was
gone
those
little
devils
began
coaxing
their
sister
to
get
down
and
run
again
at
last
she
began
to
smile
the
cunningest
and
slipped
to
the
walk
then
a
little
farther
and
a
little
farther
all
the
time
laughing
and
watching
the
nurse
the
big
boy
he
said
ai
nothing
but
a
you
ca
step
on
the
edge
like
i
can
and
then
step
back
she
says
too
she
did
to
show
him
and
just
as
she
did
she
saw
that
he
was
going
to
push
her
then
she
tried
to
get
back
but
he
did
push
and
over
she
went
not
real
in
but
her
arms
in
and
her
dress
front
some
wet
she
screamed
while
the
little
devil
that
pushed
her
grabbed
her
pretending
to
be
her
honest
he
did
up
came
nurse
just
frothing
and
in
language
we
could
understand
she
ripped
and
raved
she
dragged
little
pink
back
grabbed
her
by
the
hair
and
cracked
her
head
two
or
three
times
against
the
the
lady
screamed
and
so
did
i
and
we
both
ran
at
her
the
boys
just
shouted
and
laughed
and
the
smallest
one
he
up
and
kicked
her
while
she
was
down
the
policeman
walked
over
laughing
too
but
he
told
nurse
that
was
then
my
lady
pitched
in
so
he
told
her
to
tend
to
her
business
that
those
kids
were
too
tough
to
live
and
deserved
all
they
got
the
nurse
laughed
at
her
and
went
back
to
the
grass
with
the
policeman
the
baby
lay
there
on
the
stones
and
never
made
a
sound
she
just
kind
of
gasped
and
blinked
and
lay
there
till
my
lady
went
almost
wild
she
went
to
her
and
stooped
to
lift
her
up
when
she
got
awful
sick
the
policeman
said
something
to
the
nurse
so
she
came
and
dragged
the
kid
away
and
said
little
pig
has
gone
and
eaten
too
much
again
and
now
i
have
to
take
her
home
and
wash
and
dress
her
all
over
then
she
gave
her
an
awful
shake
the
policeman
said
she
better
cut
that
out
because
it
have
been
the
bumping
and
she
said
for
her
if
was
the
driver
pulled
up
just
then
and
he
asked
the
brat
had
been
stuffin
too
much
again
she
said
and
the
littlest
boy
he
said
pounded
her
head
on
the
stone
good
and
the
nurse
hit
him
the
mouth
till
she
knocked
him
against
the
car
and
she
said
to
try
again
open
your
head
to
say
again
and
i
smash
you
too
too
much
made
her
she
looked
at
the
big
boy
fierce
like
so
he
laughed
and
said
eating
too
much

said

she
loaded
them
in

said
something
fierce
to
the
boys

they
went
inside

saw
a
footman

and
i
said
well
we
rang
and
she
asked
pleasant
to
see
the
lady
of
the
house
on
a
little
matter
of
important
business
so
pretty
soon
here
comes
one
of
the
ladies
all
smiling
sweet
as
honey
and
asked
what
the
business
was
my
nice
lady
she
said
her
name
was
john
wilson
and
her
husband
was
a
banker
in
plymouth
illinois
and
she
was
in
the
city
shopping
and
went
to
the
park
to
rest
and
was
talking
to
me
when
an
automobile
let
out
a
nurse
and
two
boys
and
a
lovely
little
pink
girl
and
she
give
the
number
and
asked
the
car
and
the
children
hers
the
slowly
sort
of
began
to
freeze
over
and
when
the
nice
lady
got
that
far
she
said
have
an
engagement
kindly
state
in
a
words
what
you
want
my
lady
sort
of
stiffened
up
and
then
she
said
saw
this
boy
here
saw
and
the
park
policeman
nearest
the
entrance
fountain
saw
your
nurse
take
your
little
girl
by
the
hair
and
strike
her
head
against
the
fountain
curb
three
times
because
her
brother
pushed
her
in
she
lay
insensible
until
the
car
came
and
she
has
just
been
carried
into
your
house
in
that
condition
i
could
see
the
footman
peeking
and
at
that
he
cut
up
the
stairs
the
stiffened
up
and
she
said
you
are
one
of
those
meddling
interfering
country
jays
that
come
here
and
try
to
make
us
lose
our
good
servants
so
you
can
hire
them
later
i
seen
that
done
before
lucette
is
invaluable
said
she
perfectly
reliable
takes
all
the
care
of
those
dreadful
little
imps
from
me
now
you
get
out
of
here
and
she
reached
for
the
button
my
lady
just
sat
still
and
smiled
you
really
think
i
take
the
trouble
to
come
here
in
this
way
if
i
could
i
had
seen
the
thing
happen
she
asked
only
knows
what
you
country
women
would
do
the
woman
answered
would
stand
between
our
children
and
beastly
cruelty
my
lady
said
child
is
all
the
proof
my
words
need
you
go
examine
her
head
and
feel
the
welt
on
it
see
hew
ill
she
is
and
you
will
thank
me
your
nurse
is
reliable
keep
her
and
your
children
will
be
ruined
if
not
killed
sneered
the
i
know
your
kind
so
i
go
as
it
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
you
now
what
do
you
think
happened
next
well
sir
three
minutes
in
walked
the
footman
and
salutes
sneering
like
a
cat
and
he
said
compliments
she
finds
her
little
daughter
in
perfect
condition
sweetly
sleeping
and
her
sons
having
dinner
she
asks
you
to
see
how
quickly
you
can
leave
her
residence
the
woman
looked
at
me
so
i
said
all
over
but
burying
the
kid
if
it
dies
come
on
lady
they
be
to
plant
it
and
get
it
out
of
the
way
so
i
started
and
she
followed
and
just
as
he
let
me
out
the
door
i
handed
him
this
saw
you
listen
and
cut
to
tell
and
i
bet
you
helped
put
the
kid
to
sleep
but
you
better
look
out
she
gave
it
to
that
baby
too
rough
for
any
use
he
started
for
me
but
i
flew
when
we
got
on
the
street
the
lady
was
all
used
up
so
she
could
say
anything
she
had
me
call
a
taxi
to
take
her
to
her
hotel
i
set
down
her
name
she
gave
me
and
her
house
and
street
number
i
cut
to
a
newsies
directory
and
got
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
and
it
was
james
minturn
next
morning
coming
down
on
the
cars
i
was
hunting
headliners
to
make
up
a
new
call
like
i
always
do
and
there
i
saw
in
big
type
and
james
minturn
prostrate
over
the
sudden
death
of
their
lovely
little
daughter
from
poisoning
from
an
ice
she
ate
i
read
it
every
word
even
what
the
doctors
said
and
how
investigation
of
the
source
of
the
ice
came
from
was
to
be
made
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
have
no
doubt
but
it
every
word
horrible
truth
answered
douglas
said
mickey
i
just
hiked
to
the
park
and
walked
up
to
the
cop
and
showed
him
the
paper
and
he
looked
awful
glum
i
can
point
him
out
to
you
and
give
you
the
lady
address
and
there
were
plenty
more
who
saw
parts
of
it
could
be
found
if
anybody
was
on
the
side
sure
it
the
truth
well
i
kept
it
over
one
day
about
three
weeks
later
blest
if
the
same
car
did
stop
at
the
same
fountain
and
the
same
nurse
got
out
with
the
boys
and
she
set
them
on
the
same
bench
and
told
them
the
same
thing
and
then
she
went
into
another
palaver
with
the
same
i
looked
on
pretty
much
interested
and
before
long
the
boys
got
to
running
again
and
one
tripped
the
other
and
she
saw
and
come
running
and
fetched
him
a
crack
like
to
split
his
head
and
pushed
him
down
still
and
white
so
i
said
to
myself
right
for
you
lady
tried
a
lady
and
got
nothing
here
where
a
gentleman
tries
a
gentleman
and
sees
what
he
gets
i
marched
into
the
door
just
across
the
hall
from
you
here
and
faced
james
minturn
and
gave
him
names
and
dates
and
addresses
even
the
copper
name
i
got
and
i
told
him
all
i
told
you
and
considerable
more
he
was
so
fiery
as
the
lady
so
i
told
him
the
whole
thing
but
he
never
opened
his
trap
he
just
sat
still
and
stony
listened
till
i
quit
and
finally
he
heaved
a
big
breath
and
looked
at
me
sort
of
dazed
like
and
he
said
do
you
want
boy
that
made
me
red
hot
so
i
said
want
you
to
know
that
i
saw
the
same
woman
bust
one
of
your
a
good
crack
over
the
head
a
few
minutes
ago
that
made
him
jump
but
he
did
say
or
do
anything
so
i
got
up
and
went
and
the
same
woman
was
in
the
park
with
the
same
boys
yesterday
and
they
the
biggest
little
devils
there
what
the
answer
a
heartbroken
man
said
douglas
bruce
now
let
me
tell
you
mickey
then
he
told
mickey
all
he
knew
of
james
minturn
all
the
same
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
his
own
kids
of
boys
who
do
need
it
so
bad
commented
mickey
why
honest
i
do
know
one
street
kid
so
low
that
he
kick
a
little
girl
after
she
been
beat
up
scandalous
for
his
meanness
to
start
on
honest
i
do
i
do
care
what
he
is
doing
for
the
boy
he
has
got
that
boy
does
need
help
half
so
much
as
his
i
can
prove
it
to
you
if
you
come
with
me
to
the
park
any
morning
all
right
i
come
said
douglas
promptly
well
i
could
say
that
they
would
be
there
this
minute
said
mickey
but
i
can
call
you
up
the
first
time
i
see
they
are
all
right
i
come
if
it
possible
i
like
to
see
for
myself
so
this
gives
you
a
settled
prejudice
against
the
big
brother
movement
mickey
in
my
brogans
what
would
it
give
you
a
hard
jolt
said
douglas
emphatically
then
what
the
answer
that
it
is
more
unfair
than
i
thought
you
could
be
to
deprive
me
of
my
little
brother
because
you
deem
the
man
across
the
hall
unfit
to
have
one
do
i
look
as
if
you
could
trust
me
mickey
no
you
do
but
neither
does
james
minturn
he
as
if
a
fellow
could
get
a
grip
on
him
and
pull
safe
across
belgium
hanging
on
but
you
know
i
said
the
i
know
mickey
but
that
only
proves
that
there
are
times
when
even
the
strongest
man
ca
help
himself
then
like
ulhan
i
trot
to
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
said
mickey
and
i
yell
long
and
loud
and
i
put
up
the
that
would
get
the
lady
down
to
brass
tacks
see
but
with
minturn
position
and
the
stain
such
a
proceeding
would
put
on
the
boys
cut
out
the
boys
advised
mickey
they
gold
plated
staining
would
stick
to
them
so
you
are
going
to
refuse
education
employment
and
a
respectable
position
because
you
disapprove
of
one
man
among
millions
demanded
douglas
that
lets
me
out
said
mickey
educated
me
a
lot
no
day
is
long
enough
for
the
work
i
do
right
now
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
that
i
respectable
same
as
i
taking
yours
that
you
are
all
right
said
douglas
we
will
let
it
go
then
maybe
you
are
right
at
least
you
are
not
worth
the
bother
it
requires
to
wake
you
up
will
you
take
an
answer
to
the
note
you
brought
me
now
the
returns
are
coming
in
said
mickey
sure
i
will
but
she
is
in
the
big
stores
shopping
i
find
out
said
douglas
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
called
the
winton
residence
on
learning
leslie
was
still
away
he
left
a
request
that
she
call
him
when
she
returned
i
would
spend
the
time
talking
with
you
he
said
to
mickey
if
i
could
accomplish
anything
as
i
ca
i
go
on
with
my
work
you
busy
yourself
with
anything
around
the
rooms
that
interests
you
mickey
grinned
half
abashed
he
took
a
long
survey
of
the
room
they
were
in
arose
and
standing
in
the
door
leading
to
the
next
he
studied
that
to
him
busy
meant
work
presently
he
went
into
the
hall
and
returned
with
a
hand
broom
and
dust
pan
he
had
secured
from
the
janitor
he
carefully
went
over
the
floor
removing
anything
he
could
see
that
he
thought
should
not
be
there
and
then
began
on
the
room
adjoining
next
he
appeared
with
a
cloth
and
dusted
the
furniture
and
window
seats
once
he
met
douglas
eye
and
smiled
your
janitor
have
much
of
a
mother
he
commented
i
could
beat
him
to
his
base
a
rod
job
is
yours
any
time
you
want
it
morning
papers
carrolled
mickey
sterilized
deodorized
vulcanized
i
to
sell
them
defeated
again
bruce
turned
to
his
work
and
mickey
to
his
he
straightened
every
rug
pulled
a
curtain
set
a
blind
at
an
angle
that
gave
the
worker
more
light
and
better
air
he
was
investigating
the
glass
when
the
telephone
rang
hello
leslie
it
certainly
was
how
did
you
do
it
not
so
hilarious
as
you
might
suppose
leslie
i
want
to
say
something
not
for
the
wire
will
you
hold
the
line
a
second
until
i
start
mickey
with
it
all
right
she
is
there
now
mickey
can
you
find
your
way
sure
laughed
mickey
if
you
put
the
address
on
she
started
me
from
the
street
the
address
is
plain
for
straightening
my
rooms
and
carrying
the
note
will
that
be
about
right
a
gee
cried
mickey
i
did
you
was
a
plute
and
i
do
so
yet
you
want
a
little
brother
bad
if
you
willing
to
one
this
number
ai
far
out
and
i
would
have
sold
more
than
three
papers
this
time
of
day
is
about
right
but
you
forget
cleaning
my
rooms
said
douglas
mickey
grinned
his
face
flushed
me
to
you
he
said
nothing
just
a
little
matter
of
keeping
in
practice
and
be
good
to
yourself
douglas
turned
to
the
telephone
leslie
he
said
i
sending
mickey
back
to
you
with
a
note
not
because
i
had
anything
to
say
i
could
say
now
but
because
i
manage
him
i
pretended
i
did
care
and
let
him
go
ca
you
help
me
see
if
you
ca
interest
him
in
something
that
at
least
will
bring
him
back
or
show
us
where
to
find
him
certainly
thank
you
very
much
when
mickey
delivered
the
letter
the
lovely
young
woman
just
happened
to
be
in
the
hall
she
told
him
to
come
in
until
she
read
it
to
learn
what
bruce
wanted
mickey
followed
into
a
big
room
looked
around
then
a
speculative
appreciative
gleam
crossed
his
face
he
realized
the
difference
between
a
home
and
a
show
room
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
seeing
or
why
it
affected
him
as
it
did
really
the
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
was
that
this
woman
was
far
more
attractive
but
had
less
money
to
spend
on
her
home
than
many
others
he
missed
the
glitter
but
enjoyed
the
comfort
for
he
leaned
back
against
the
chair
offered
him
thinking
what
a
cool
restful
place
it
was
the
girl
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
open
the
letter
have
trouble
finding
mr
bruce
she
asked
easy
i
been
to
the
same
building
before
and
i
suppose
you
be
there
many
times
again
she
suggested
i
going
back
right
now
if
you
want
to
send
an
answer
to
that
letter
he
said
and
if
it
requires
none
she
questioned
then
i
going
to
try
to
sell
the
rest
of
these
papers
get
a
slate
for
lily
and
go
home
is
lily
your
little
sister
she
asked
mickey
straightened
firmly
closing
his
lips
he
had
done
it
again
just
a
little
girl
i
know
he
said
cautiously
a
little
bit
of
a
girl
she
asked
the
littlest
girl
you
ever
saw
said
mickey
unconsciously
interested
in
the
subject
and
you
are
going
to
take
her
a
slate
to
draw
pictures
on
how
fine
i
wish
you
carry
her
a
package
for
me
too
i
was
arranging
my
dresser
this
morning
and
i
put
the
ribbons
i
do
want
into
a
box
for
some
child
maybe
lily
would
like
them
for
her
doll
lily
has
any
doll
he
said
she
had
one
but
her
granny
sold
it
and
got
drunk
on
the
money
mickey
stopped
suddenly
in
a
minute
more
he
would
have
another
orphans
home
argument
on
his
hands
scandalous
cried
leslie
in
my
room
there
is
a
doll
just
begging
to
go
to
some
little
girl
if
you
took
it
to
lily
would
her
granny
sell
it
again
not
this
morning
said
mickey
you
see
miss
a
few
days
ago
she
lost
her
breath
permanent
no
if
lily
had
a
doll
nobody
would
take
it
from
her
now
i
bring
it
at
once
she
offered
and
the
ribbons
never
mind
said
mickey
i
can
get
her
a
doll
but
you
have
seen
this
one
cried
leslie
you
save
your
money
for
oranges
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
left
the
room
presently
returning
with
a
box
and
a
doll
that
seemed
to
mickey
quite
as
large
as
peaches
it
had
a
beautiful
face
hair
real
hair
that
could
be
combed
and
real
clothes
that
could
be
taken
off
leslie
had
dressed
it
for
a
birthday
gift
for
the
little
daughter
of
one
of
her
friends
but
by
making
haste
she
could
prepare
another
mickey
gazed
in
bewilderment
he
had
seen
dolls
even
larger
and
more
wonderful
than
that
in
the
shop
windows
but
connecting
such
a
creation
with
his
room
and
peaches
required
mental
adjustments
i
guess
you
better
not
he
said
with
conviction
but
why
not
asked
leslie
in
amazement
well
for
fifty
reasons
replied
mickey
you
see
lily
is
a
poor
kid
and
her
back
is
bad
that
doll
is
so
big
she
could
dress
it
without
getting
all
tired
out
and
what
the
use
showing
her
such
dresses
when
she
ca
have
any
herself
she
got
the
best
she
ever
had
and
the
best
she
can
have
right
now
so
that
ai
the
kind
of
a
doll
for
lily
it
too
big
and
too
too
gladsome
i
see
laughed
leslie
well
mickey
you
show
me
what
would
be
the
right
size
of
a
doll
for
lily
i
get
another
and
dress
it
as
you
say
how
would
that
do
you
need
said
mickey
lily
is
happy
now
but
would
she
a
doll
persisted
leslie
i
never
knew
a
girl
who
did
love
a
doll
would
she
a
doll
to
death
i
said
mickey
i
know
she
said
she
cried
for
the
one
her
granny
sold
she
beat
her
yes
i
guess
she
a
doll
but
i
can
get
her
one
but
you
ca
make
white
nighties
for
lily
to
put
on
it
to
take
to
bed
with
her
and
cunning
little
dresses
for
morning
and
a
street
dress
for
afternoon
and
a
party
dress
for
evening
tempted
the
girl
lily
has
been
on
the
street
twice
and
she
never
heard
of
a
party
just
nighties
and
the
morning
dress
would
do
and
there
no
use
for
me
to
be
sticking
if
you
like
to
give
away
dolls
lily
might
as
well
have
one
for
she
just
i
do
know
what
she
would
do
about
it
conceded
mickey
all
right
said
leslie
i
dress
it
this
afternoon
and
tomorrow
you
can
come
for
it
in
the
evening
before
you
go
home
if
i
am
not
here
the
package
will
be
ready
take
the
ribbons
now
she
like
them
for
her
hair
her
hair
too
short
for
a
ribbon
said
mickey
then
a
headband
this
way
said
leslie
she
opened
a
box
and
displayed
a
wonderment
of
ribbon
bands
and
bits
of
gay
colour
gee
gasped
mickey
i
could
pick
up
that
much
brightness
for
her
in
a
year
you
save
what
you
find
for
her
asked
leslie
sure
said
mickey
you
see
miss
things

pretty
plain
where
she
is
so

the
brightness
i
can
take
her
ai
going
to
hurt
her
eyes

you
heaps

there
going
to
be
any

the
letter
why

yet
cried
the
girl

see
that
some
one
else

rustling

your
grub
commented
mickey
that
so
too
laughed
leslie
darling
old
daddy
just
about

is
he
queried
mickey
interestedly
just
exactly
right
said
leslie
said
mickey
some
of
them
ai
so
well
fixed
and
he
that
wrote
the
note
i
guess
he
about
as
fine
as
you
make
them
too
he
the
finest
man
i
ever
have
known
mickey
said
the
girl
earnestly
barring
daddy
suggested
mickey
not
barring
anybody
cried
she
daddy
is
lovely
but
he
daddy
bruce
is
different
no
letter
questioned
mickey
rising
none
said
the
girl
come
night
you
are
sure
lily
is
so
very
little
mickey
you
would
call
me
big
would
you
he
asked
well
i
can
lift
her
with
one
hand
such
a
large
doll
as
that
would
be
tiring
and
confusing
please
make
lily
like
she
used
see
mickey
i
do
see
said
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon
lily
doll
shall
not
tire
her
or
make
her
discontented
with
what
she
has
thank
you
for
a
good
idea
mickey
returned
to
the
street
shortly
after
noon
with
more
in
his
pocket
than
he
usually
earned
in
a
day
where
by
expert
work
he
soon
disposed
of
his
last
paper
he
bought
the
slate
then
hurried
home
carrying
it
and
the
box
at
the
grocery
he
carefully
selected
food
again
then
he
threw
open
his
door
and
achieved
this
a
little
kid
named
peaches
swelled
my
heart
until
it
eatches
if
you
think
i
trade
her
for
a
dog
your
has
slipped
a
cog
peaches
laughed
stretching
her
hands
as
usual
mickey
stooped
for
her
caress
scattering
the
ribbons
over
her
as
he
arose
she
gasped
in
delighted
amazement
oh
mickey
where
did
you
ever
mickey
where
did
you
get
them
mickey
you
did
st
you
just
better
choke
on

miss
yelled
mickey

do

and
nothing

be
st
and
you
need
ever

more
st
at

mickey
i
did
that
course
i
know
you
course
i
know
you
mickey
that
the
best
poetry
piece
yet
did
you
bring
the
slate
sure
said
mickey
somewhat
mollified
but
still
injured
i
must
have
dropped
it
with
the
banquet
peaches
pushed
away
the
billow
of
colour
taking
the
slate
her
fingers
picking
at
the
string
reminded
mickey
of
sparrow
feet
but
he
watched
until
she
untied
and
removed
the
paper
which
he
folded
to
lay
away
she
picked
up
the
pencil
meditating
mickey
she
said
make
my
hand
do
a
word
sure
said
mickey
what
do
you
want
to
write
first
peaches
looked
at
him
reproachfully
course
there
would
be
but
i
want
to
do
first
of
all
she
said
hold
my
hand
tight
and
big
and
plain
up
at
the
top
make
it
write
sure
said
the
boy
in
a
hushed
voice
he
gripped
the
hand
bending
above
her
but
suddenly
collapsed
buried
his
face
in
her
hair
and
sobbed
until
he
shook
peaches
crouched
down
lying
rigidly
she
was
badly
frightened
at
last
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
mickey
she
gasped
mickey
what
did
i
do
mickey
do
write
it
if
you
do
to
mickey
arose
wiping
his
face
on
the
sheet
you
just
bet
i
want
to
write
that
lily
he
said
i
never
wanted
to
do
anything
in
all
my
life
then
why
she
began
never
you
mind
miss
said
mickey
grasping
her
hand
he
traced
the
words
peaches
looked
at
them
a
long
time
then
carefully
laid
the
slate
aside
she
began
fingering
the
ribbons
let
me
wash
you
said
mickey
and
rub
your
back
to
rest
you
from
all
this
day
then
i
comb
your
hair
and
you
pick
the
prettiest
one
put
it
on
the
way
she
showed
me
so
you
be
a
lady
who
showed
you
mickey
and
gave
you
such
pretties
a
girl
i
carried
a
letter
to
after
you
bathed
and
have
had
supper
i
tell
you
then
mickey
began
work
he
sponged
peaches
rubbed
her
back
laid
her
on
his
pallet
putting
fresh
sheets
on
her
bed
and
carefully
preparing
her
supper
after
she
had
eaten
he
again
ran
the
comb
through
her
ringlets
telling
her
to
select
the
ribbon
he
should
use
no
you
said
peaches
mickey
squinted
so
exacting
was
the
work
of
deciding
red
he
discarded
with
one
sweep
against
her
white
cheeks
green
went
with
it
blue
almost
made
him
shudder
but
a
soft
warm
pink
pleased
him
so
mickey
folded
it
into
the
bands
in
which
it
had
been
creased
before
binding
it
around
peaches
head
as
leslie
had
shown
him
then
with
awkward
fingers
did
his
best
on
a
big
bow
he
crossed
the
room
and
picked
up
a
mirror
which
he
held
before
her
reciting
once
a
little
kid
named
peaches
swelled
my
heart
peaches
took
the
mirror
studying
the
face
intently
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
so
mickey
piled
the
pillows
higher
then
she
looked
at
him
mickey
scrutinized
her
closely
you
clean
kid
clean
as
a
plate
he
assured
her
honest
you
are
you
need
worry
about
that
i
always
keep
you
washed
clean
was
more
particular
about
that
than
anything
else
do
you
fret
about
my
having
a
dirty
girl
around
you
clean
all
right
peaches
sighed
as
she
returned
the
mirror
mickey
replaced
it
laid
the
slate
and
ribbons
in
reach
washed
the
dishes
then
the
sheets
he
had
removed
and
their
soiled
clothing
peaches
lay
folding
and
unfolding
the
ribbons
asking
questions
while
mickey
worked
or
with
the
pencil
tracing
her
best
imitations
of
the
name
on
the
slate
by
the
time
he
had
finished
everything
to
be
done
and
drawn
a
chair
beside
the
bed
to
see
if
she
had
learned
her
lesson
for
the
day
it
was
cool
evening
she
knew
all
the
words
he
had
given
her
so
he
proceeded
to
write
them
on
the
slate
then
told
her
about
the
big
man
named
douglas
bruce
and
the
lovely
girl
named
leslie
winton
also
every
word
he
could
remember
about
the
house
she
lived
in
then
he
added
lily

you

to
be
surprised

you
like
to
think
things
over

do

chapter
vi
song
of
a
leslie
said
the
voice
of
james
minturn
over
the
telephone
is
there
any
particular
time
of
the
day
when
that
bird
of
yours
sings
better
than
at
another
morning
minturn
five
the
latest
at
that
time
one
hears
the
full
chorus
and
sees
the
perfect
beauty
really
i
would
ask
you
if
i
were
not
sure
positively
sure
that
you
find
the
trip
worth
while
i
be
ready
in
the
morning
but
that
an
unearthly
hour
came
the
protest
it
is
almost
unearthly
sights
and
sounds
to
which
you
are
going
answered
leslie
and
be
sure
you
wear
suitable
clothing
what
do
you
call
suitable
clothing
high
heavy
shoes
said
leslie
short
stout
skirts
as
if
i
had
such
things
laughed
minturn
let
me
send
you
something
of
mine
offered
leslie
i
enough
for
two
you
not
figuring
on
really
going
in
one
of
those
awful
places
are
you
questioned
minturn
surely
cried
leslie
the
birds
wo
sing
to
an
automobile
and
you
would
miss
seeing
such
flowers
on
their
stems
as
you
saw
at
for
any
money
it
will
be
something
to
tell
your
friends
about
send
what
i
should
have
i
ride
a
llama
through
a
sea
of
champagne
for
a
new
experience
minturn
turned
from
the
telephone
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
on
her
face
but
leslie
gay
laugh
persisted
in
her
ears
restlessly
she
moved
through
her
rooms
thinking
what
she
might
do
to
divert
herself
and
shrinking
from
all
the
tiresome
things
she
had
been
doing
for
years
until
there
was
not
a
drop
of
the
fresh
juice
of
life
to
be
extracted
from
them
i
going
to
take
a
bath
go
to
bed
early
and
see
if
i
can
sleep
she
muttered
i
do
know
what
it
is
that
james
is
contemplating
but
his
face
haunts
me
really
if
he
does
be
more
civil
and
stop
his
morose
glowering
when
i
do
see
him
i
put
him
or
myself
where
we
wo
come
in
contact
he
makes
it
plain
every
day
that
he
blames
me
about
elizabeth
why
should
he
he
could
possibly
know
of
the
call
of
that
reformer
so
unfortunate
that
she
should
come
just
at
that
time
too
of
course
hundreds
of
children
die
from
spoiled
milk
every
summer
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor
i
never
get
over
regretting
that
i
did
finish
what
i
started
to
do
but
i
scarcely
touched
her
in
her
life
she
always
was
so
pink
and
warm
and
that
awful
whiteness
chilled
me
to
the
soul
i
wish
i
had
driven
forced
myself
then
i
could
defy
james
with
more
spirit
that
what
i
lack
maybe
this
trip
to
the
swamp
will
steady
my
nerves
something
must
be
done
soon
and
i
believe
actually
i
believe
he
is
thinking
of
doing
it
pooh
what
he
do
there
is
an
irregularity
in
my
life
he
can
lay
his
fingers
on
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
cancelling
two
engagements
for
the
evening
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
when
she
was
called
early
in
the
morning
she
gladly
arose
and
was
dressed
in
leslie
winton
short
skirts
a
waist
of
khaki
and
high
shoes
near
enough
her
size
to
be
comfortable
her
bath
had
refreshed
her
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
stimulated
her
and
despite
the
lack
of
sleep
she
felt
better
than
she
had
that
spring
as
she
went
down
to
the
car
on
the
threshold
she
met
her
husband
evidently
he
had
been
out
all
night
on
strenuous
business
his
face
was
haggard
his
eyes
bloodshot
while
in
both
hands
he
gripped
a
small
square
package
they
looked
at
each
other
a
second
that
seemed
long
to
both
then
the
woman
laughed
evidently
an
accounting
is
expected
she
said
leslie
winton
at
the
door
and
the
roll
of
music
i
carry
should
be
sufficient
to
prove
why
i
am
going
out
at
this
hour
you
heard
us
make
the
arrangement
thank
heaven
i
no
interest
in
knowing
where
you
have
been
or
what
your
precious
package
contains
his
expression
and
condition
frightened
her
for
the
weight
of
a
straw
overbalance
he
said
only
for
a
hint
that
you
have
a
soul
i
freeze
it
for
all
time
with
the
contents
of
this
package
a
threat
you
to
me
she
cried
in
amazement
verily
madam
he
said
i
wish
you
all
the
joy
of
the
birds
and
flowers
this
morning
you
gone
mad
she
cried
contrarily
i
have
come
to
my
senses
after
years
of
insanity
he
said
i
will
see
you
when
you
return
she
stood
bewildered
watching
him
go
down
the
hall
and
enter
his
library
that
and
his
sleeping
room
were
the
only
places
in
the
house
sacred
to
him
no
one
entered
no
one
not
even
the
incorrigible
children
touched
anything
there
she
slowly
went
to
the
car
trying
to
rally
to
leslie
greeting
struggling
to
fix
her
mind
on
anything
pointed
out
to
her
as
something
she
might
enjoy
at
last
she
said
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
leslie
james
is
planning
something
i
have
an
idea
what
but
his
grim
reproachful
face
is
slowly
driving
me
wild
i
getting
so
i
sleep
you
saw
him
come
home
as
i
left
he
talked
positively
crazy
as
if
he
had
the
crack
of
doom
in
his
hands
and
were
prepared
to
crack
it
he
said
he
see
me
when
i
came
back
indeed
he
will
to
his
sorrow
he
will
be
as
he
used
to
be
or
we
will
separate
the
idea
with
scarcely
a
cent
to
his
name
of
him
undertaking
to
dictate
to
me
me
do
you
blame
me
leslie
you
heard
him
the
other
day
you
know
how
he
insulted
me
leslie
leaned
forward
laying
a
firm
hand
in
a
grip
on
arm
since
you
ask
me
she
said
i
will
answer
if
you
find
life
with
minturn
insufferable
an
agony
to
both
of
you
i
separate
and
if
it
has
come
to
the
place
where
you
ca
see
each
other
or
speak
without
falling
into
unpleasantness
then
i
keep
apart
that
is
exactly
the
case
cried
minturn
oh
leslie
i
am
so
glad
you
agree
with
me
but
i
have
finished
said
leslie
you
interrupted
me
in
the
middle
if
you
are
absolutely
sure
you
ca
go
on
peaceably
i
would
stop
but
if
i
once
had
loved
a
man
enough
to
give
my
life
and
my
happiness
into
his
keeping
to
make
him
the
father
of
my
children
i
would
not
separate
from
him
until
i
had
exhausted
every
resource
to
see
if
i
could
in
some
possible
way
end
with
credit
if
you
had
been
through
what
i
have
said
minturn
you
endure
it
any
longer
perhaps
said
leslie
but
you
see
dear
minturn
i
am
handicapped
by
not
knowing
you
have
been
through
to
your
world
you
appear
to
be
a
woman
of
great
wealth
who
does
exactly
as
she
pleases
and
pays
her
own
bills
you
seem
to
have
unlimited
money
power
position
leisure
for
anything
you
fancy
i
wager
you
know
the
names
of
half
the
servants
in
your
house
a
skillful
housekeeper
takes
the
responsibility
off
your
hands
you
never
are
seen
in
public
with
your
children
competent
nurses
care
for
them
you
appear
with
your
husband
any
more
yet
he
is
a
man
of
fine
brain
unimpeachable
character
who
handles
big
affairs
for
other
men
and
father
says
he
believes
his
bank
account
would
surprise
you
he
has
been
in
business
for
years
surely
all
he
makes
does
go
to
other
men
you
know
i
never
thought
of
that
cried
minturn
he
had
nothing
to
begin
on
and
i
always
kept
our
establishment
he
never
paid
for
more
than
his
clothing
do
you
suppose
that
he
has
made
money
i
know
that
he
has
said
leslie
not
so
fast
as
he
might
not
so
much
as
he
could
for
he
is
incorruptible
but
money
yes
he
is
a
powerful
man
not
only
in
the
city
but
all
over
the
state
some
of
these
days
you
going
to
wake
up
to
find
him
a
senator
or
governor
you
seem
to
be
the
only
person
who
does
know
it
or
who
does
care
if
you
do
but
when
it
comes
about
as
it
will
you
be
so
proud
of
him
dear
minturn
please
please
go
slowly
do
oh
do
let
anything
happen
that
will
make
a
big
regret
for
both
leslie
where
did
you
get
all
this
asked
minturn
in
tones
of
mingled
interest
and
surprise
from
my
father
answered
leslie
and
from
douglas
bruce
office
is
across
the
hall
from
minturn
they
meet
daily
and
from
the
first
they
have
been
friends
minturn
took
douglas
to
his
clubs
introduced
him
and
helped
him
into
business
so
often
they
work
together
why
only
yesterday
douglas
came
to
me
filled
with
delight
minturn
secured
an
appointment
for
him
to
make
an
investigation
for
the
city
which
will
be
a
great
help
to
douglas
it
will
bring
him
in
contact
with
prominent
men
give
him
big
work
and
a
sample
of
how
mercenary
i
am
it
will
bring
him
big
pay
and
he
knows
how
to
use
the
money
in
a
big
way
douglas
knows
minturn
so
well
and
respects
him
so
highly
yet
no
one
can
know
him
as
you
do
that
is
quite
true
i
live
with
him
i
know
the
real
man
cried
minturn
how
mean
of
you
laughed
leslie
to
distort
my
reasoning
like
that
i
do
ask
you
to
think
up
all
the
little
things
that
have
massed
into
one
big
grievance
against
him
i
mean
stop
that
for
out
here
in
the
country
where
everything
is
so
lovely
and
go
back
where
i
am
he
surely
has
an
advocate
leslie
when
did
you
start
making
an
especial
study
of
mr
minturn
when
douglas
bruce
began
speaking
to
me
so
frequently
of
him
answered
leslie
then
i
commenced
to
watch
him
and
to
listen
to
what
people
were
saying
about
him
and
to
ask
daddy
it
very
funny
that
every
one
seems
so
well
informed
and
so
enthusiastic
just
at
the
time
when
i
feel
that
life
is
unendurable
with
him
said
minturn
i
ca
understand
it
minturn
try
oh
do
try
to
get
my
viewpoint
before
you
do
anything
irreparable
begged
leslie
away
up
here
in
the
woods
think
it
out
let
discuss
james
minturn
in
every
phase
of
his
nature
and
see
if
the
big
manly
part
does
far
outweigh
the
little
irritations
let
see
if
you
ca
possibly
go
to
the
meeting
he
wants
when
we
return
with
a
balance
struck
in
his
favour
a
divorced
woman
is
always
well
it
disagreeable
alone
you
feel
stranded
attempt
marrying
again
where
would
you
find
a
man
with
half
the
points
that
count
for
good
to
replace
him
in
after
years
when
your
children
realize
the
man
he
is
how
are
you
going
to
explain
to
them
why
you
could
live
with
him
from
your
rush
of
words
it
is
evident
you
have
your
arguments
at
hand
said
minturn
you
been
thinking
more
about
my
affairs
than
i
ever
did
you
bring
up
points
i
never
have
thought
of
you
make
me
see
things
that
would
not
have
occurred
to
me
yet
as
you
put
them
they
have
awful
force
you
have
exactly
said
it
but
what
you
mean
is
that
you
believe
in
the
wrong
so
do
all
my
friends
all
of
you
sympathize
with
minturn
all
of
you
think
him
a
big
man
worthy
of
every
consideration
and
me
deserving
none
you
putting
that
too
strong
retorted
leslie
you
are
right
about
minturn
but
i
wo
admit
that
i
find
you
of
no
consideration
at
all
or
i
would
be
imploring
you
to
give
yourself
a
chance
at
happiness
myself
a
chance
at
happiness
dear
minturn
yes
said
leslie
all
your
life
so
far
you
have
lived
absolutely
for
yourself
for
your
personal
pleasure
has
happiness
resulted
happiness
cried
minturn
in
amazement
you
little
fool
with
my
husband
practically
a
madman
my
children
incorrigible
my
nerves
on
edge
until
i
ca
sleep
because
one
thought
comes
over
and
over
well
you
achieved
it
in
society
said
leslie
it
the
result
of
doing
exactly
what
you
to
you
ca
say
james
minturn
was
to
blame
for
what
you
had
the
money
and
the
desire
to
do
you
ca
think
your
babies
would
have
preferred
their
mother
to
the
nurses
and
governesses
they
have
had
if
you
say
another
word
about
that
i
jump
from
the
car
and
break
my
neck
threatened
minturn
no
one
sympathizes
with
me
that
is
untrue
said
leslie
i
care
or
i
would
be
doing
what
i
am
now
and
as
for
sympathy
i
have
a
doubt
but
every
woman
of
your
especial
set
will
weep
tears
of
condolence
with
you
if
you
tell
them
what
you
have
me
there
is
clinton
and
farley
and
a
dozen
women
among
your
dearest
friends
who
have
divorced
their
husbands
and
are
free
lances
or
remarried
you
can
have
friends
enough
to
suit
you
in
any
event
fools
fools
cried
minturn
they
never
read
anything
their
idea
of
any
art
would
convulse
you
they
do
know
a
note
of
real
music
but
they
are
your
best
friends
interposed
leslie
what
then
is
their
attraction
i
am
sure
i
do
know
said
minturn
i
suppose
it
unlimited
means
to
follow
any
fad
or
fancy
to
live
extravagantly
as
they
choose
to
dress
faultlessly
as
they
have
taste
freedom
to
go
as
they
please
oh
they
do
have
a
good
time
are
you
sure
that
they
did
go
through
the
same
time
you
are
having
right
now
before
they
lost
the
men
they
loved
and
married
and
then
became
mothers
who
later
deliberately
orphaned
their
own
children
leslie
for
god
sake
where
did
you
learn
it
cried
minturn
how
can
you
hit
like
that
you
make
me
feel
like
a
like
a
oh
lord
do
let
talk
any
more
minturn
suggested
leslie
you
know
what
all
refined
people
think
you
know
society
and
what
it
has
to
offer
you
making
yourself
unhappy
while
i
am
helping
you
but
if
some
one
does
stop
you
you
may
lose
the
love
of
a
good
man
the
respect
of
the
people
worth
while
and
later
of
your
own
children
see
here
is
the
swamp
and
this
is
as
close
as
we
can
go
with
the
car
is
this
where
you
found
the
flowers
for
your
basket
yes
said
leslie
no
snakes
no
quicksands
snakes
do
like
this
kind
of
moss
answered
leslie
this
is
an
old
lake
bed
grown
up
with
tamaracks
and
the
bog
of
a
thousand
years
looks
as
if
ten
thousand
might
come
closer
where
you
ever
in
such
a
place
asked
leslie
never
said
minturn
well
to
do
this
to
perfection
said
leslie
we
should
go
far
enough
for
you
to
see
the
home
life
of
our
rarest
wild
flowers
and
to
get
the
music
full
effect
we
must
look
for
a
high
place
to
spread
this
waterproof
sheet
i
have
brought
along
then
nestle
down
and
keep
still
the
birds
will
see
us
going
in
but
if
we
make
ourselves
inconspicuous
they
will
soon
forget
us
have
you
the
score
yes
answered
minturn
go
ahead
leslie
had
not
expected
minturn
calm
tones
and
placid
acceptance
of
the
swamp
the
girl
sent
one
searching
look
the
woman
way
then
came
enlightenment
this
was
a
stunt
minturn
had
been
doing
stunts
in
the
hope
of
new
sensations
all
her
life
what
others
could
do
she
could
if
she
chose
in
this
instance
she
chose
to
penetrate
a
tamarack
swamp
at
six
in
the
morning
to
listen
to
the
notes
of
a
bird
i
select
the
highest
places
and
go
as
nearly
where
we
were
as
i
can
said
leslie
if
you
step
in
my
tracks
you
be
all
right
why
you
not
afraid
are
you
asked
minturn
not
in
the
least
said
leslie
are
you
no
said
minturn
one
strikes
almost
everything
motoring
through
the
country
in
the
mountains
or
at
sea
and
travelling
this
looks
interesting
how
deep
could
one
sink
anyway
deeply
enough
to
satisfy
you
laughed
leslie
come
quietly
now
grasping
the
score
she
carried
minturn
unconcernedly
plunged
after
leslie
purposely
the
girl
went
slowly
stooping
beneath
branches
skirting
too
wet
places
slipping
over
the
high
hummocks
turning
to
indicate
by
gesture
a
moss
bed
a
flower
or
glancing
upward
to
try
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
some
entrancing
musician
once
leslie
turned
to
look
back
and
saw
minturn
on
her
knees
separating
the
silvery
green
moss
heads
and
thrusting
her
hand
deeply
to
learn
the
length
of
the
roots
she
noticed
the
lady
absorbed
face
and
the
wet
patches
spreading
around
her
knees
leslie
fancied
she
could
see
minturn
entering
the
next
gathering
of
her
friends
smiling
faintly
and
crying
dear
people
i
had
a
perfectly
new
experience
she
could
hear
every
tone
of
minturn
voice
saying
ferns
as
luxuriant
as
anything
in
florida
moss
beds
several
feet
deep
a
hundred
birds
singing
and
all
before
sunrise
my
dears
when
minturn
arose
leslie
went
forward
slowly
until
she
reached
the
moccasin
flowers
but
remembering
she
did
not
stop
the
woman
did
she
stooped
and
leslie
winced
as
she
snapped
one
to
examine
it
critically
she
held
it
up
in
the
gray
light
turning
it
did
you
ever
see
little
elizabeth
she
asked
yes
said
leslie
do
you
think
she
stopped
abruptly
that
one
is
too
deep
said
leslie
the
colour
he
saw
was
on
a
freshly
opened
one
like
that
she
pointed
to
a
paler
moccasin
of
exquisite
pink
with
red
lavender
veining
minturn
assented
he
ca
forget
anything
she
said
or
let
any
one
else
he
always
will
keep
harping
we
were
peculiarly
unfortunate
that
day
said
leslie
he
really
had
no
intention
of
saying
anything
if
he
had
been
forced
oh
he
does
require
forcing
said
minturn
he
always
at
the
overflow
point
about
her
perhaps
he
was
very
fond
of
her
suggested
leslie
he
was
perfectly
foolish
about
her
said
minturn
impatiently
i
lost
a
nurse
or
two
through
his
interference
when
i
got
such
a
treasure
as
lucette
i
just
told
her
to
take
complete
charge
make
him
attend
his
own
affairs
and
not
try
being
a
nursery
maid
it
really
is
done
these
days
leslie
closed
her
lips
moving
forward
until
she
reached
the
space
where
the
ragged
boys
and
the
fringed
girls
floated
their
white
banners
where
lacy
yellow
and
lavender
blooms
caressed
each
other
there
on
the
highest
place
she
could
select
across
a
log
she
spread
the
waterproof
sheet
and
seating
herself
motioned
minturn
to
do
the
same
she
reached
for
the
music
and
opening
it
ran
over
the
score
her
finger
paused
on
the
notes
she
had
whistled
while
with
eager
face
she
sat
waiting
minturn
dropped
into
an
attitude
of
tense
listening
the
sun
began
dissipating
the
gray
mists
and
heightening
the
exquisite
tints
on
all
sides
every
green
imaginable
was
there
from
palest
silver
to
the
deepest
darkest
shades
all
dew
wet
rankly
growing
gold
tinted
and
showing
clearer
each
minute
gradually
minturn
relaxed
made
herself
comfortable
as
possible
then
turned
to
the
orchids
of
the
open
space
the
colour
flushed
and
faded
on
her
tired
face
she
nervously
rolled
the
moccasin
stem
in
her
fingers
or
looked
long
at
the
delicate
flower
she
was
thinking
so
intently
that
leslie
saw
she
was
neither
seeing
the
swamp
nor
hearing
the
birds
it
was
then
that
a
little
gray
singer
straying
through
the
tamaracks
sent
a
wireless
to
his
mate
in
the
bushes
of
borderland
in
which
he
wished
to
convey
to
her
all
there
was
in
his
heart
about
the
wonders
of
spring
the
joy
of
mating
the
love
of
her
and
their
nest
he
waited
a
second
then
tucking
his
tail
swelled
his
throat
and
made
sure
he
had
done
his
best
at
the
first
measure
leslie
thrust
the
sheet
before
minturn
pointing
to
the
place
instantly
the
woman
scanned
the
score
then
leaned
forward
listening
as
the
bird
flew
leslie
faced
minturn
with
questioning
eyes
she
cried
softly
he
did
it
perfectly
if
i
had
heard
i
never
would
have
believed
there
is
another
that
can
do
this
from
verdi
leslie
whistled
the
notes
we
may
hear
him
also
again
they
waited
leslie
realized
that
minturn
was
not
listening
and
would
have
to
be
recalled
if
the
bird
sang
leslie
sat
silent
the
same
bird
sang
and
others
but
to
the
girl
had
come
the
intuition
that
minturn
was
having
her
hour
in
the
garden
so
wisely
she
remained
silent
after
an
interminable
time
she
arose
making
her
way
forward
as
far
as
she
could
penetrate
and
still
see
the
figure
of
the
woman
then
hunting
an
old
stump
climbed
upon
it
and
did
some
thinking
herself
at
last
she
returned
to
the
motionless
figure
minturn
was
leaning
against
the
tamarack
scraggy
trunk
her
head
resting
on
a
branch
lightly
sleeping
a
rivulet
staining
her
cheeks
from
each
eye
showed
where
slow
tears
had
slipped
from
under
her
closed
lids
leslie
heart
ached
with
pity
she
thought
she
never
had
seen
any
one
seem
so
sad
so
alone
so
punished
for
sins
of
inheritance
and
rearing
she
sat
beside
minturn
waiting
until
she
awakened
why
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
she
cried
for
a
minute
said
leslie
but
i
feel
as
if
i
had
rested
soundly
a
whole
night
said
minturn
i
so
refreshed
and
there
goes
that
bird
again
verdi
to
take
his
notes
who
ever
would
have
thought
of
it
leslie
did
you
bring
any
lunch
i
famished
we
must
go
back
to
the
car
said
leslie
they
spread
the
waterproof
sheet
on
the
ground
where
it
would
be
bordered
with
daintily
traced
partridge
berry
and
plantain
leaves
and
sitting
on
it
ate
their
lunch
leslie
did
what
she
could
to
interest
minturn
and
cheer
her
but
at
last
that
lady
said
thank
you
dear
you
are
very
good
to
me
but
you
ca
entertain
me
some
other
time
we
come
back
and
bring
the
scores
you
suggest
and
see
what
we
can
really
hear
from
these
birds
but
i
got
the
battle
of
my
life
to
fight
something
is
coming
i
should
be
in
a
measure
prepared
and
as
i
do
know
what
to
expect
it
takes
all
the
brains
i
have
to
figure
things
out
you
do
know
mrs
minturn
asked
leslie
no
she
said
wearily
i
know
james
hates
the
life
i
lead
he
thinks
my
time
wasted
i
know
he
a
disappointed
man
because
he
thought
when
he
married
me
he
could
cut
me
out
of
everything
worth
while
in
the
world
and
set
me
to
waiting
on
him
and
nursing
his
children
every
single
thing
i
have
done
since
or
wanted
or
had
has
been
a
disappointment
to
him
i
know
now
he
never
would
have
married
me
if
he
had
figured
he
was
going
to
make
me
over
shape
me
and
my
life
to
suit
his
whims
and
throw
away
my
money
to
please
his
fancies
been
utterly
discontented
since
elizabeth
was
born
why
leslie
we
have
lived
together
since
then
he
said
if
i
were
going
to
persist
in
bringing
into
the
world
babies
i
would
mother
myself
or
would
allow
him
to
father
there
would
be
no
more
children
i
laughed
at
him
because
i
did
think
he
meant
it
but
he
did
so
that
ended
even
a
semblance
of
content
half
the
time
i
do
know
where
he
is
or
what
he
is
doing
he
seldom
knows
where
i
am
if
we
appear
together
it
is
accidental
i
thought
i
had
my
mind
made
up
to
leave
him
and
soon
but
what
you
say
coupled
with
doubts
i
had
myself
have
set
me
to
thinking
till
i
do
know
i
hate
a
scandal
you
know
how
careful
i
always
have
been
all
my
closest
friends
have
jeered
me
for
a
prude
there
is
a
flaw
he
can
find
there
has
been
none
certainly
not
said
leslie
every
one
knows
that
leslie
you
do
know
do
you
asked
minturn
he
did
say
anything
to
bruce
did
he
you
want
an
honest
answer
questioned
leslie
of
course
i
do
cried
minturn
douglas
did
tell
me
in
connection
with
minturn
joining
the
brotherhood
and
taking
a
gamin
from
the
streets
into
his
office
that
he
said
he
was
scarcely
allowed
to
see
his
own
sons
not
to
exercise
the
slightest
control
so
he
was
going
to
try
his
theories
on
a
little
brother
but
douglas
would
mention
it
only
to
me
and
of
course
i
would
repeat
it
to
any
one
minturn
seemed
to
feel
that
douglas
thought
it
peculiar
for
a
man
having
sons
to
take
so
much
pains
with
a
newsboy
they
great
friends
so
he
said
that
much
to
bruce
said
that
much
scoffed
minturn
well
even
so
that
is
very
little
compared
with
what
you
said
about
him
to
me
retorted
leslie
you
should
complain
on
that
score
i
suppose
in
your
eyes
i
should
complain
about
anything
said
minturn
a
world
of
things
minturn
but
not
the
ones
you
do
said
leslie
oh
cried
minturn
i
think
your
grievance
is
that
you
were
born
in
and
reared
for
society
said
leslie
and
in
your
extremity
it
has
failed
you
i
believe
i
can
give
you
more
help
than
any
woman
of
your
age
and
intimate
association
that
true
leslie
quite
true
exclaimed
minturn
eagerly
and
i
need
help
oh
i
do
you
poor
soul
you
comforted
leslie
turn
where
you
belong
turn
to
your
own
blood
my
mother
would
jeer
me
for
a
weakling
said
minturn
she
has
urged
me
to
divorce
james
ever
since
elizabeth
was
born
i
did
mean
your
mother
said
leslie
i
meant
closer
relatives
i
meant
your
husband
and
sons
my
husband
would
probably
tell
me
he
had
lost
all
respect
for
me
while
my
sons
would
very
likely
pull
my
hair
and
kick
my
shins
if
i
knelt
to
them
for
sympathy
said
minturn
they
are
perfect
little
animals
oh
mrs
minturn
cried
leslie
amazed
then
you
simply
must
take
them
in
charge
and
save
them
they
are
so
fine
looking
while
you
their
mother
you
are
it
means
giving
up
life
as
i
have
known
it
always
just
about
everything
said
minturn
look
at
yourself
now
said
leslie
i
should
think
you
would
be
glad
to
give
up
your
present
state
leslie
do
you
think
it
wrong
to
gather
those
orchids
i
think
it
unpardonable
sin
to
them
answered
leslie
if
you
have
any
reason
for
wanting
a
few
and
merely
gather
the
flowers
leaving
the
roots
to
spread
and
bloom
another
year
i
should
say
take
them
will
you
wait
in
the
car
until
i
go
back
she
asked
but
i
wish
to
be
alone
said
minturn
you
not
afraid
you
wo
become
lost
i
am
not
afraid
and
i
will
not
lose
myself
said
minturn
must
i
hurry
take
all
the
time
you
want
said
leslie
it
was
when
she
returned
her
hands
filled
with
a
dripping
moss
ball
in
which
she
had
embedded
the
stems
of
a
mass
of
feathery
orchids
her
face
was
flushed
with
tears
but
her
eyes
were
bright
her
step
quick
and
alert
leslie
what
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
do
she
cried
then
without
awaiting
a
reply
i
going
to
ask
james
to
go
with
me
to
take
these
to
elizabeth
to
beg
him
to
forgive
my
neglect
of
her
to
pledge
the
rest
of
my
life
to
him
and
the
boys
leslie
caught
minturn
in
her
arms
oh
you
darling
she
exulted
oh
you
brave
wonderful
girl
after
all
it
no
more
than
fair
minturn
said
i
have
had
everything
my
way
since
we
were
married
and
i
did
love
james
he
the
only
man
i
have
ever
really
wanted
leslie
he
will
forgive
me
and
start
over
wo
he
he
be
at
your
feet
cried
leslie
fortunately
i
have
decided
to
be
at
his
said
minturn
reached
the
place
where
i
will
even
wipe
james
nose
and
dress
malcolm
and
fix
james
studs
if
it
will
help
me
to
sleep
and
have
only
a
tinge
of
what
you
seem
to
be
running
over
with
leslie
you
are
the
most
joyous
soul
you
see
i
never
had
to
think
about
myself
said
leslie
daddy
always
thought
for
me
so
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
spend
my
time
and
thought
on
but
him
it
was
a
beautiful
arrangement
leslie
this
is
your
car
but
wo
you
dear
drive
fast
begged
minturn
of
course
nellie
exclaimed
the
girl
leslie
will
you
stand
by
me
and
show
me
the
way
all
you
can
asked
minturn
anxiously
i
lose
every
friend
i
have
got
my
house
must
be
torn
down
and
built
up
from
the
basement
on
a
new
system
as
to
management
and
i
have
an
idea
to
do
it
oh
i
hope
james
can
help
me
you
may
be
sure
james
will
know
and
can
help
you
comforted
leslie
you
be
leaving
for
the
seashore
in
a
few
days
install
a
complete
new
retinue
and
begin
all
fresh
half
the
servants
you
keep
really
interested
in
their
work
would
make
you
far
more
comfortable
than
you
are
now
yes
i
think
that
too
agreed
minturn
eagerly
some
way
i
feel
as
if
i
were
turning
against
lucette
i
never
want
to
see
her
again
after
i
tell
her
to
go
not
that
i
know
what
i
shall
do
without
her
the
boys
will
probably
burn
down
the
house
and
where
i
find
a
woman
who
will
tolerate
them
i
do
know
employ
a
man
until
you
get
control
suggested
leslie
they
are
both
old
enough
hire
a
man
and
explain
all
you
want
to
him
they
be
afraid
of
a
man
afraid
cried
minturn
they
are
afraid
of
lucette
i
understand
it
i
wonder
if
james
poor
james
laughed
leslie
honestly
nellie
do
impose
too
much
of
your
your
work
on
him
undertake
it
yourself
show
him
what
a
woman
you
are
great
heavens
leslie
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
cried
minturn
my
only
hope
lies
in
deceiving
him
if
i
showed
him
the
woman
i
am
as
i
saw
myself
back
there
in
that
swamp
an
hour
ago
he
take
one
look
and
strangle
me
for
the
public
good
how
ridiculous
exclaimed
leslie
why
must
a
woman
always
rush
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
choose
a
middle
course
and
keep
it
that
what
i
am
telling
you
i
must
do
said
minturn
leslie
it
is
wonderful
how
i
feel
i
almost
flying
do
you
honestly
think
it
is
possible
that
there
is
going
to
be
something
new
something
interesting
something
really
worth
while
in
the
world
for
me
i
know
it
said
leslie
such
interest
such
novelty
such
joy
as
you
never
have
experienced
with
that
hope
in
her
heart
her
eyes
filled
with
excitement
nellie
minturn
rang
her
bell
ran
past
her
footman
and
hurried
up
the
stairs
she
laid
her
flowers
on
a
table
summoned
her
maid
then
began
throwing
off
her
hat
and
outer
clothing
do
you
know
if
minturn
is
here
yes
he
began
the
maid
never
mind
what
get
out
the
prettiest
simplest
dress
i
own
and
the
most
becoming
she
ordered
be
quick
ca
you
see
i
in
a
hurry
minturn
i
think
you
will
thank
me
for
telling
you
there
is
an
awful
row
in
the
library
said
the
maid
awful
row
minturn
paused
yes
i
think
they
are
killing
lucette
explained
the
maid
shrieked
bloody
murder
two
or
three
times
who
what
do
you
mean
demanded
minturn
she
slipped
on
the
bathrobe
she
had
picked
up
and
stood
holding
it
together
gazing
at
the
maid
minturn
came
with
two
men
one
was
a
park
policeman
we
know
they
went
into
the
library
and
sent
for
lucette
there
she
goes
again
is
there
any
way
i
could
see
could
hear
what
is
going
on
without
being
seen
there
a
door
to
the
den
from
the
back
hall
and
that
leads
to
the
library
suggested
the
maid
show
me
help
me
begged
minturn
as
they
passed
the
table
the
orchids
hanging
over
the
edge
caught
on
the
trailing
robe
and
started
to
fall
minturn
paused
to
push
them
back
then
studied
the
flowers
an
instant
and
catching
up
the
bunch
carried
it
along
she
closed
the
den
door
after
her
without
a
sound
and
creeping
beside
the
wall
hid
behind
the
door
curtain
and
peeped
into
the
library
there
were
two
men
who
evidently
were
a
detective
and
a
policeman
she
saw
lucette
backed
against
the
wall
her
hands
clenched
her
eyes
wild
with
fear
she
saw
her
husband
back
and
on
the
table
beside
him
a
little
box
open
its
wrappings
near
its
contents
terrifying
to
the
woman
to
sum
up
then
said
minturn
in
tones
she
never
before
had
heard
i
can
put
on
oath
this
man
who
will
be
forced
to
tell
what
he
witnessed
or
be
impeached
by
others
who
saw
it
at
the
same
time
and
ready
to
testify
to
what
he
said
i
can
produce
the
boy
who
came
to
tell
me
the
part
he
took
in
it
i
have
the
affidavit
and
have
just
come
from
the
woman
who
interfered
and
followed
you
here
in
an
effort
to
save
elizabeth
i
have
this
piece
of
work
in
my
hands
done
by
one
of
the
greatest
scientists
and
two
of
the
best
surgeons
living
although
you
shrink
from
it
i
take
pleasure
in
showing
it
to
you
this
ragged
seam
is
an
impress
of
the
crack
you
made
in
a
tiny
skull
lying
in
a
vault
out
at
forest
hill
he
paused
holding
a
plaster
cast
before
the
woman
it
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
he
said
deliberately
she
was
a
tiny
creature
to
have
been
done
to
death
at
your
hands
i
hope
you
will
see
that
small
pink
face
as
i
see
it
and
feel
the
soft
hair
in
your
fingers
and
after
all
i
ca
go
on
with
that
but
i
am
telling
you
and
showing
you
exactly
what
you
are
facing
because
you
must
go
from
this
house
with
these
men
your
things
will
be
sent
you
must
leave
this
city
and
this
country
on
the
boat
they
take
you
to
and
where
you
go
you
will
be
watched
if
ever
you
dare
take
service
handling
a
again
i
shall
have
you
promptly
arrested
and
forced
to
answer
for
the
murder
of
my
little
daughter
live
you
must
i
suppose
but
not
longer
by
the
torture
of
children
go
before
i
strangle
you
as
you
deserve
how
minturn
came
to
be
standing
beside
her
husband
she
never
afterward
knew
only
that
she
was
pulling
down
his
arm
to
stare
at
the
white
cast
then
she
looked
up
at
him
and
said
simply
but
lucette
did
murder
her
it
was
i
was
her
mother
i
knew
she
was
beaten
i
knew
she
was
abused
i
did
stop
my
pleasure
to
interfere
lest
i
should
lose
a
minute
by
having
to
see
to
her
myself
a
woman
did
come
to
me
and
a
boy
i
knew
they
were
telling
the
truth
i
did
know
it
was
so
bad
but
i
knew
it
must
have
been
dreadful
to
bring
them
i
had
my
chance
to
save
her
i
went
to
her
as
the
woman
told
me
to
and
because
she
was
quiet
i
did
even
turn
her
over
i
did
run
a
finger
across
her
little
head
i
did
call
a
surgeon
i
preferred
an
hour
of
pleasure
to
taking
the
risk
of
being
disturbed
i
am
quite
as
guilty
as
lucette
have
them
take
me
with
her
james
minturn
stepped
back
gazing
at
his
wife
then
he
motioned
the
men
toward
the
door
so
with
the
woman
they
left
the
room
lucette
just
had
her
sentence
he
said
now
for
yours
words
are
useless
i
am
leaving
your
house
with
my
sons
they
my
sons
and
with
the
proof
i
hold
you
will
not
claim
them
if
you
do
you
will
not
get
them
i
am
taking
them
to
the
kind
of
a
house
i
deem
suitable
for
them
and
to
such
care
as
i
can
provide
i
shall
keep
them
in
my
presence
constantly
as
possible
until
i
see
just
what
harm
has
been
done
and
how
to
remedy
what
can
be
changed
i
shall
provide
such
teachers
as
i
see
fit
for
them
and
devote
the
remainder
of
my
life
to
them
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
spare
them
the
disgrace
of
forcing
me
to
my
right
to
them
or
ever
having
them
realize
just
happened
to
their
sister
and
part
in
it
she
held
the
flowers
toward
him
i
brought
these
she
began
then
paused
you
would
believe
me
if
i
should
tell
you
you
are
right
perfectly
justified
of
course
i
shall
not
bring
this
before
the
public
go
at
the
door
he
looked
back
she
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
holding
the
cast
in
one
hand
the
fringed
orchids
in
the
other
chapter

an
awful
whopper

the
cross

thus
chanted
mickey
at
his
door
his
hands
behind
him
peaches
stretched
both
hers
toward
him
as
usual
but
he
stood
still
swinging
in
front
of
him
a
beautiful
doll
for
a
little
sick
girl
a
baby
doll
in
a
long
snowy
dress
and
a

held

hands
peaches
lunged
forward
until
only
mickey
agility
saved
her
from
falling
he
tossed
the
doll
on
the
bed
and
caught
the
child
the
lump
in
his
throat
so
big
his
voice
was
strained
as
he
cried
why
you
silly
thing
with
her
safe
he
again
proffered
it
peaches
shut
her
eyes
and
buried
her
face
on
his
breast
oh
do
let
me
see
it
take
it
away
why
lily
i
thought
you
be
crazy

it
marvelled
mickey

prettiest
lady

it
to
you

me
tell
you
giving
them
up
is
worser
never
having
them
take
it
away
wailed
peaches
well
lily
said
mickey
i
never
was
stuck
up
about
my
looks
but
i
did
i
looked
so
like
a
granny
that
you
think
of
me
do
i
seem
man
enough
to
take
care
of
a
little
selling
her
doll
there
where
i
got
your
granny
skinned
a
mile
i
do
booze
and
i
never
will
mother
hammered
that
into
me
now
look
what
a
pretty
it
is
you
just
love
it
i
would
take
it
i
lay
out
anybody
who
would
come
on
now
negotiate
it
get
your
flippers
on
it
he
was
holding
the
child
gently
and
stroking
her
tumbled
hair
when
he
put
her
from
him
to
see
her
face
mickey
was
filled
with
envy
because
he
had
been
forced
to
admit
the
gift
was
not
from
him
he
shut
his
lips
tight
but
his
face
was
grim
as
he
studied
peaches
flushed
cheeks
and
wet
eyes
and
noted
the
shaking
eagerness
for
the
doll
she
was
afraid
to
look
at
he
reached
over
and
put
it
into
her
arms
then
piled
the
pillows
so
she
could
see
better
talking
the
while
to
comfort
her
course
it
is
yours
course
nobody
is
going
to
take
it
course
you
shall
have
it
and
maybe
a
lady
doll
by
christmas
who
knows
in
utter
content
peaches
sank
against
the
pillows
watching
mickey
while
she
gripped
the
baby
thank
you
she
said
oh
thank
you
for
this
precious
child
you
got
to
thank
a
lady
about
twice
my
height
with
dark
hair
pink
cheeks
and
beautiful
dresses
she
got
a
big
rest
house
a
lover
man
and
an
automobile
i
wish
you
could
see
lily
he
said
if
i
was
on
the
rags
in
the
corner
i
have
this
child
would
i
scoffed
peaches
still
clutching
the
doll
but
her
gaze
on
mickey
what
happened
was
she
for
something
and
you
the
baby
so
you
brought
it
to
me
thank
you
mickey
for
this
precious
child
peaches
lifted
her
lips
mickey
met
them
more
obsessed
than
before
then
she
turned
away
clasping
the
doll
mickey
could
see
that
the
tears
were
slipping
from
under
the
child
closed
lids
but
her
lips
were
on
the
doll
face
so
he
knew
she
was
happy
he
stole
out
to
bring
in
his
purchases
for
supper
and
begin
his
evening
work
he
gave
peaches
a
drink
her
daily
rub
cleaned
the
room
without
making
dust
as
the
nurse
had
shown
him
and
brought
water
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
faucet
now
hereafter
nix
on
the
butting
in
he
said
belligerently
mebby
i
could
have
got
doll
but
i
could
have
got
one
she
have
just
as
well
and
earned
it
extra
in
one
day
there
one
feature
of
the
big
brother
business
that
i
was
a
little
too
fast
on
he
the
finest
man
that
ever
wanted
me
while
his
rooms
are
done
shameful
i
could
put
a
glitter
on
them
so
he
could
see
himself
with
the
things
he
has
to
work
with
and
he
said
any
time
i
wanted
it
the
job
was
mine
it
would
be
cheating
him
any
if
i
took
it
and
did
better
work
than
he
getting
and
my
steady
papers
are
sure
in
the
morning
that
would
be
sure
in
the
afternoon
and
if
i
cut
ice
with
a
buzz
saw
i
might
get
through
in
time
to
pick
up
something
else
before
coming
home
and
being
sure
beats
a
mile
yes
ten
miles
mebby
i
investigate
that
business
a
little
further
hereafter
i
provide
for
my
own
family
see
lily
was
grand
about
it
gee
smart
to
think
it
out
that
way
all
in
a
minute
but
by
and
by
going
to
have
a
lot
of
time
to
think
then
she
be
remembering
about
the
lady
i
got
to
tell
her
of
of
as
she
guess
i
run
my
own
family
i
take
another
look
at
cleaning
that
office
there
ai
any
business
in
a
job
and
being
paid
for
it
if
you
do
it
well
mickey
turned
the
faucet
and
marched
up
the
stairs
with
head
high
and
shoulders
square
his
face
was
grave
while
he
worked
but
peaches
was
so
happy
she
did
not
notice
when
he
came
with
her
supper
she
kissed
the
doll
then
insisted
on
mickey
kissing
it
also
such
was
the
state
of
his
subjugation
he
commenced
with
aw
and
ended
by
doing
as
he
was
told
he
even
helped
lay
the
doll
beside
peaches
exactly
as
her
fancy
dictated
and
covered
it
with
her
sheet
putting
its
hands
outside
peaches
was
enchanted
she
insisted
on
offering
it
a
drink
of
her
milk
first
and
was
so
tremulously
careful
lest
she
spill
a
drop
that
mickey
had
to
guide
her
hand
he
promised
to
wash
the
doll
dress
if
she
did
have
an
accident
or
when
it
became
soiled
and
bowed
his
head
meekly
to
the
crowning
concession
by
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
after
he
had
finished
his
evening
work
and
holding
the
doll
where
she
could
see
it
exactly
as
instructed
while
he
told
her
about
his
wonderful
adventure
began
yesterday
explained
mickey

told
you

when
she

you
never

a
box
of

wholly
i

mickey
when
shall
i
you
go
to
sleep
said
mickey
now
tell
me
about
the
baby
urged
peaches
sure
i
i
it
myself
like
i
was
telling
you
but
the
ones
in
the
stores
have
such
funny
clothes
they
look
so
silly
i
knew
i
could
wash
them
and
of
course
they
get
dirty
like
everything
does
and
we
could
them
dirty
so
i
thought
it
over
and
i
said
to
the
joy
lady
is
so
anxious
to
get
the
baby
and
sew
its
clothes
herself
why
i
just
let
her
so
i
did
her
but
it
took
some
time
to
make
them
so
i
had
to
wait
to
bring
it
tonight
i
was
to
go
to
her
house
after
it
and
when
i
got
there
she
was
coming
home
in
her
car
from
a
long
drive
and
gee
lily
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
she
the
prettiest
lady
and
the
most
joyous
lady
i
ever
saw
prettier
than
the
nurse
lady
asked
peaches
well
different
explained
mickey
nurse
lady
is
all
gold
like
the
end
of
sunrise
alley
at
four
in
the
morning
this
lady
has
dark
hair
and
eyes
both
of
them
are
as
pretty
as
women
are
made
but
they
are
not
the
same
nurse
lady
is
when
the
sun
comes
up
and
warms
and
comforts
the
world
but
the
is
like
all
the
stars
twinkling
in
the
moonlight
on
the
park
lake
and
music
playing
and
everybody
dancing
the
is
joy
just
the
joy
lady
gee
lily
you
should
have
seen
her
face
when
the
car
stopped
while
i
was
coming
down
the
steps
was
she
so
glad
to
see
you
asked
peaches
was
me
said
mickey
was
on
her
face
she
saw
me
she
was
just
gleaming
and
shining
and
spilling
over
joy
she
is
the
kind
that
would
dance
on
the
street
nor
where
it
ai
nice
to
dance
but
she
was
dancing
inside
just
the
same
she
pulled
me
right
into
that
big
fine
car
so
i
sat
on
the
seat
with
her
and
we
went
sailing
and
skating
and
flying
along
and
all
the
boys
guying
me
but
i
care
i
like
to
ride
in
her
car
i
never
rode
in
a
car
like
that
before
she
went
right
to
the
office
of
the
big
man
where
maybe
i
work
i
guess
i
go
see
him
tomorrow
i
got
a
hankering
for
knowing
what
i
going
to
and
i
going
to
be
paid
for
it
well
she
went
spinning
there
and
she
said
wait
a
minute
then
she
ran
in
and
pretty
soon
out
she
came
with
him
his
name
is
douglas
bruce
and
i
guess
it
would
be
a
little
closer
what
think
right
if
i
use
it
and
hers
he
calls
her
by
is
leslie
that
pretty
when
he
says
sounds
as
if
he
kissed
the
name
as
it
came
through
honest
it
does
i
bet
he
says
it
just
like
you
say
i
wonder
now
grinned
mickey
well
he
came
out
and
what
she
had
told
him
set
him
crazy
too
they
just
talked
a
streak
but
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
she
said
tell
the
driver
where
to
go
mickey
and
i
said
where
miss
and
she
said
take
you
home
and
i
said
do
need
and
she
said
like
to
and
i
saw
she
care
she
did
so
i
just
sent
him
to
the
end
of
the
car
line
and
saved
my
nickel
and
then
i
come
on
here
and
both
of
them
what
asked
peaches
eagerly
mickey
changed
the
wanted
to
come
to
see
you
that
had
been
on
his
lips
if
he
told
peaches
that
and
she
asked
for
them
to
come
and
they
came
and
then
thought
he
was
not
taking
care
of
her
right
and
took
her
away
from
him
then
what
said
the
nicest
he
substituted
and
i
going
to
see
if
she
wants
any
more
letters
carried
as
soon
as
my
papers
are
gone
in
the
morning
and
if
she
does
i
going
to
take
them
and
if
one
is
to
him
i
going
to
ask
him
more
about
the
job
he
offered
me
and
if
we
can
agree
i
going
to
take
it
then
i
can
buy
you
what
you
want
myself
because
i
know
every
day
exactly
what
i
have
and
when
the
rent
is
counted
out
and
for
the
papers
all
the

peaches

mickey

burn
down
each
other

wavering
lines
and
tremulous
curves

her
first
day
work
alone
over
erasures
and
with
relinings
in
hills
and
deep
depressions
which
it
is
possible
mickey
read
because
he
knew
what
it
had
to
be
he
proudly
translated
then
the
lines
of
the
night
before
then
cow
and
milk
and
then
mickey
whooped
because
he
faintly
recognized
an
effort
to
draw
a
picture
of

the
milk
bottle
grand
lily
he
cried

inquired
peaches
well
for
smart
as
you
are
in
some
spots
you
awful
dumb
in
others
commented
mickey
what
you
do
saphead
gee
ai
you
ai
you
my
ai
good
enough
for
you
your
name
will
be
miss
lily
peaches
that
a
name
good
enough
for
a
queen
lady
what
a
queen
inquired
peaches
wife
of
those
kings
we
were
just
talking
about
sure
said
peaches
none
of
them
have
a
nicer
name
than
that
mickey
is
my
bow
straight
naw
it
ai
said
mickey
take
the
baby
i
fix
it
it
about
slipped
off
there
that
better
mickey
let
me
see
it
suggested
peaches
mickey
brought
the
mirror
she
looked
so
long
he
grew
tired
and
started
to
put
it
back
but
she
clung
to
it
just
lay
it
on
the
bed
she
said
naw
i
do
miss
chicken
he
said
mirrors
cost
money
and
if
you
pull
the
sheet
in
the
night
and
slide
ours
off
and
it
breaks
we
got
seven
years
of
bad
luck
coming
and
we
are
nix
on
changing
the
luck
we
have
right
now
it
good
enough
for
us
think
of
them
belgium
kids
where
the
kings
are
making
the
fathers
fight
this
goes
where
it
belongs
then
you
take
your
drink
and
let
me
beat
your
pillow
and
you
fix
your
baby
and
then
we
say
our
prayers
and
go
to
sleep
mickey
replaced
the
mirror
and
carried
out
the
program
he
had
outlined
when
he
came
to
the
prayer
he
ordered
peaches
to
shut
her
eyes
fold
her
hands
and
repeat
after
him
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
peaches
eyes
opened
oh
is
it
a
poetry
prayer
mickey
she
asked
yes
kind
of
a
one
say
it
answered
mickey
peaches
obeyed
repeating
the
words
lingeringly
and
in
her
sweetest
tones
mickey
thrilled
to
his
task
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
keep
he
proceeded
what
my
soul
mickey
she
asked
the
very
nicest
thing
inside
of
you
explained
mickey

on
like
my
heart

mickey
opened
his
eyes
looking
at
peaches
his
lips
in
a
set
line
his
brow
wrinkled
in
thought
well
i
do
know
what
they
went
and
put
in
for
he
said
indignantly
scaring
little
kids
into
fits

all

prompted
mickey
and
the
child
smilingly
repeated
the
words
now
comes
some
said
mickey
i
do
know
just
how
to
manage
them
you
have
a
father
to
bless
and
your
mother

what

her
long
ago

more
recent
i
tell
you

the
sunshine

the
things
to

me
comfortable
and
bless
the
moonshine
lady
for
the
ribbons
and
the
doll
aw
cried
peaches
staring
up
at
him
in
rebellion
now
you
go
on
miss
chicken
ordered
mickey
losing
patience
and
then
you
end
with
which
means
be
it
or
it
happen
that
way
or
something
like
that
go
to
it
now
peaches
shut
her
eyes
refolded
her
hands
and
lifted
her
chin
after
a
long
pause
mickey
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
she
said
sweetly
bless
an
bless
him
an
bless
him
million
times
bless
him
for
the
bed
an
the
window
an
bless
him
for
finding
the
nurse
lady
an
bringing
the
ribbons
an
the
doll
an
bless
him
for
the
slate
an
the
teachin
an
bless
him
for
everything
i
just
love
an
love
amen
hard
when
peaches
opened
her
eyes
she
found
mickey
watching
her
a
commingling
of
surprise
and
delight
on
his
face
then
he
bent
over
and
laid
his
cheek
against
hers
you
fool
little
kid
he
whispered
tenderly
you
precious
fool
little
you
make
a
fellow
love
you
he
nearly
busts
inside
kiss
me
lily
he
slipped
the
ribbon
from
her
hair
straightened
the
sheets
arranged
as
the
nurse
had
taught
him
laid
the
doll
as
peaches
desired
and
then
screened
by
the
foot
of
the
bed
undressed
and
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
the
same
moon
that
peeped
in
the
window
to
smile
her
broadest
at
peaches
and
her
precious
child
and
touched
mickey
face
to
wondrous
beauty
at
that
hour
also
sent
shining
bars
of
light
across
the
veranda
where
leslie
sat
and
told
douglas
bruce
about
the
trip
to
the
swamp
i
never
knew
i
could
be
so
happy
over
anything
in
all
this
world
that
did
include
you
and
daddy
but
of
course
this
does
in
a
way
you
at
least
much
as
you
think
of
and
are
with
minturn
you
ca
help
being
glad
that
joy
has
come
to
him
at
last
why
do
you
say
something
douglas
i
have
been
effervescing
ever
since
you
came
to
the
office
after
me
and
i
find
now
that
the
froth
is
off
i
getting
to
the
solid
facts
in
the
case
and
well
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
to
spoil
your
joyous
day
but
i
worried
of
song
worried
cried
leslie
why
you
do
think
he
would
be
pleased
you
do
think
he
might
not
be
responsive
do
you
think
of
the
past
years
of
neglect
insult
and
humiliation
suggested
douglas
think
of
the
future
years
of
loving
care
reparation
and
joy
commented
leslie
please
god
they
outweigh
said
douglas
of
course
they
will
it
must
be
a
few
things
i
seen
lately
that
keep
puzzling
me
what
have
you
seen
douglas
questioned
leslie
deals
in
real
estate
he
answered
consultations
with
detectives
and
policemen
scientists
and
surgeons
but
what
could
that
have
to
do
with
nellie
minturn
nothing
i
hope
said
douglas
but
there
has
been
a
grimness
about
minturn
lately
a
going
ahead
with
jaws
set
that
looks
ugly
for
what
opposes
him
and
you
tell
me
they
have
been
in
opposition
ever
since
they
married
i
ca
put
him
from
my
thoughts
as
i
saw
him
last
and
i
ca
her
said
leslie
she
was
a
lovely
picture
as
she
came
across
the
silver
moss
carpet
you
know
that
gray
green
douglas
her
face
flushed
her
eyes
wet
her
arms
full
of
those
perfectly
beautiful
fringed
orchids
she
a
handsome
woman
dearest
and
she
never
looked
quite
so
well
to
me
as
when
she
came
picking
her
way
beneath
the
dark
tamarack
boughs
she
was
going
to
ask
him
to
go
with
her
to
take
her
flowers
to
elizabeth
and
over
that
little
white
casket
she
intended
why
douglas
he
could
he
simply
could
suppose
he
had
something
previously
worked
out
that
cut
her
off
oh
douglas
what
makes
you
think
such
a
thing
what
minturn
said
to
me
this
morning
with
such
bitterness
on
his
face
and
in
his
voice
as
i
never
before
encountered
in
man
douglas
answered
he
said
prompted
leslie
this
is
my
day
as
a
for
my
fellowmen
i
shall
hold
up
my
head
why
did
you
tell
me
that
did
realize
until
just
now
that
you
and
she
had
him
that
you
were
acting
on
presumption
i
going
to
call
her
cried
leslie
i
would
advised
douglas
why
not
after
as
far
as
she
went
if
she
had
anything
she
wanted
you
to
know
would
she
feel
free
to
call
you
you
are
right
conceded
leslie
even
after
for
me
to
call
would
be
an
intrusion
let
not
talk
of
it
further
do
you
wish
we
could
take
a
peep
at
mickey
carrying
the
doll
to
the
little
sick
girl
i
surely
do
answered
douglas
what
do
you
think
of
him
leslie
great
simply
great
cried
the
girl
douglas
you
should
have
heard
him
educate
me
on
the
doll
question
how
he
asked
interestedly
from
the
first
glimpse
i
had
of
him
the
thought
came
to
me
douglas
little
brother
she
explained
when
you
telephoned
and
said
you
were
sending
him
to
me
just
one
idea
possessed
me
to
get
what
you
wanted
almost
without
thought
at
all
i
tried
the
first
thing
he
mentioned
which
happened
to
be
a
little
sick
neighbour
girl
he
told
me
about
all
girls
like
a
doll
and
i
had
one
dressed
for
a
birthday
gift
for
a
namesake
of
mine
and
time
plenty
to
fix
her
another
i
brought
it
to
mickey
and
thought
he
be
delighted
was
he
rude
inquired
douglas
anxiously
not
in
the
least
she
answered
only
casual
merely
made
me
see
how
thoughtless
and
unkind
and
positively
vulgar
my
idea
of
pleasing
a
poor
child
was
leslie
you
shock
me
exclaimed
douglas
i
mean
every
word
of
it
said
the
girl
now
listen
to
me
it
thoughtless
to
offer
a
gift
headlong
without
considering
a
second
is
it
not
merely
impulsive
replied
douglas
identically
the
same
thing
declared
leslie
listen
i
said
without
a
thought
about
suitability
i
offered
an
extremely
poor
child
the
gift
i
had
prepared
for
a
very
rich
one
mickey
made
me
see
in
ten
words
that
it
would
be
no
kindness
to
fill
his
little
friend
head
with
thoughts
that
would
sadden
her
heart
with
envy
make
her
feel
all
she
lacked
more
keenly
than
ever
give
her
a
gift
that
would
breed
dissatisfaction
instead
of
joy
if
that
is
vulgarity
what
is
mickey
lily
has
no
business
with
a
doll
so
gorgeous
the
very
sight
of
it
brings
longing
instead
of
comfort
it
was
unkind
to
offer
a
gift
so
big
and
heavy
it
would
tire
and
worry
her
there
some
ideas
there
on
giving
are
there
though
said
leslie
mickey
took
about
three
minutes
to
show
me
that
lily
was
as
she
was
so
no
one
would
thank
me
for
awakening
discontent
in
her
heart
he
measured
off
her
size
and
proved
to
me
that
a
small
doll
that
would
not
tire
her
to
handle
would
be
suitable
and
so
dressed
that
its
clothes
could
be
washed
and
would
be
plain
as
her
own
even
further
once
my
brain
began
working
i
saw
that
a
lady
doll
with
shoes
and
stockings
to
suggest
outdoors
and
walking
was
not
a
kind
gift
to
make
a
bedridden
child
douglas
after
mickey
started
me
i
arose
by
myself
to
the
point
of
seeing
that
a
little
cuddly
baby
doll
helpless
as
she
one
that
she
could
nestle
and
play
with
lying
in
bed
would
be
the
proper
gift
for
lily
think
of
a
making
me
see
is
he
wonderful
you
should
have
heard
him
making
me
see
things
said
douglas
yours
are
faint
and
feeble
to
the
ones
he
taught
me
refused
me
at
every
point
and
marched
away
leaving
me
in
utter
rout
outside
wanting
you
for
my
wife
more
than
anything
else
on
earth
i
wanted
mickey
for
my
little
brother
you
have
him
comforted
the
girl
the
lord
arranged
that
you
remember
he
said
men
are
brothers
and
was
it
tolstoy
who
wrote
people
would
only
understand
that
they
are
not
the
sons
of
some
fatherland
or
other
nor
of
governments
but
are
sons
of
god
you
and
mickey
will
get
your
brotherhood
arranged
to
suit
both
of
you
some
of
these
days
exactly
conceded
douglas
but
i
wanted
mickey
at
hand
now
i
wanted
him
to
come
and
go
with
me
to
be
educated
with
what
i
consider
education
it
will
come
yet
prophesied
leslie
your
ideas
are
splendid
i
see
how
fine
they
are
the
trouble
is
this
you
had
a
plan
mapped
out
at
which
mickey
was
to
jump
mickey
happened
to
have
preconceived
ideas
on
the
subject
so
he
did
jump
you
wanted
to
be
the
king
on
the
throne
and
stretch
out
a
royal
hand
laughed
leslie
you
wanted
to
lift
mickey
to
your
level
and
with
the
inherent
fineness
in
him
have
him
feel
eternal
love
and
gratitude
toward
you
that
sounds
different
but
it
is
the
real
truth
and
mickey
does
care
to
be
brother
to
kings
he
does
perceive
the
throne
even
he
wants
you
to
understand
at
the
start
that
you
will
as
well
as
refusing
pay
for
tidying
your
office
was
his
first
inning
that
to
you
was
great
i
can
see
the
accompanying
gesture
it
was
the
same
one
he
used
in
demolishing
my
doll
something
vital
and
inborn
something
loneliness
work
the
crowd
and
raw
life
have
taught
mickey
that
we
do
know
learn
all
you
can
from
him
i
had
one
good
lesson
i
receptive
and
ready
for
the
next
call
the
car
and
drive
an
hour
that
will
be
pleasant
agreed
douglas
anywhere
in
the
suburbs
to
avoid
the
crowds
was
leslie
order
to
her
driver
slowly
under
traffic
regulations
the
car
ran
through
the
pleasant
spring
night
the
occupants
talking
without
caring
where
they
were
so
long
as
they
were
together
in
motion
and
it
was
may
they
were
passing
residences
where
city
and
country
met
the
dwellings
of
people
city
bound
country
determined
homes
where
men
gave
so
many
hours
to
earning
money
then
sped
away
to
train
vines
prune
trees
dig
in
warm
earth
and
make
things
grow
such
men
now
crossed
green
lawns
and
talked
fertilizers
new
annuals
tree
surgery
and
carried
gifts
of
fragrant
blooming
things
to
their
friends
here
the
verandas
were
wide
and
children
ran
from
them
to
grassy
playgrounds
on
them
women
read
or
sat
with
embroidery
hoops
or
visited
in
small
groups
let
move
said
leslie
let
coax
daddy
to
sell
our
place
and
come
here
one
would
ever
need
go
summering
it
cool
and
pleasant
always
i
love
it
there
a
new
house
and
a
lawn
under
old
trees
to
shelter
playing
children
is
it
charming
quite
but
that
small
specimen
seems
refractory
leslie
leaned
forward
to
see
past
him
in
an
open
door
stood
a
man
clearly
silhouetted
against
the
light
down
the
steps
sped
a
screaming
boy
about
nine
after
him
ran
another
five
or
six
years
older
when
the
child
saw
he
would
be
overtaken
he
headed
straight
for
the
street
as
the
pursuer
hand
brushed
him
he
threw
himself
kicking
and
clawing
the
elder
boy
hesitated
looking
for
an
opening
to
find
a
hold
the
car
was
half
a
block
away
when
leslie
turned
a
white
face
to
douglas
and
gasped
inarticulately
he
understood
something
was
wrong
so
signalled
the
driver
to
stop
turn
and
pass
those
children
again
ordered
leslie
as
the
car
went
by
slowly
the
second
time
the
child
still
fought
the
boy
stepped
back
while
james
minturn
with
grim
face
bent
under
the
light
and
by
force
took
into
his
arms
the
twisting
fighting
boy
heaven
help
him
cried
douglas
not
a
sign
of
happy
reconciliation
there
leslie
tried
to
choke
down
her
sobs
oh
nellie
minturn
poor
woman
she
wailed
so
what
he
was
doing
marvelled
douglas
a
house
he
has
built
to
suit
himself
training
his
sons
personally
with
the
assistance
of
his
little
brother
that
boy
was
william
i
see
him
in
minturn
office
every
day
oh
i
think
he
might
have
given
her
a
chance
protested
leslie
remember
how
she
was
reared
think
what
a
struggle
it
was
for
her
even
to
contemplate
trying
to
be
different
evidently
she
was
too
late
said
douglas
he
must
have
been
gone
before
you
returned
from
the
swamp
i
going
back
there
and
tell
him
a
few
things
i
think
he
might
have
waited
douglas
i
afraid
he
did
wait
she
said
he
told
her
he
wanted
to
talk
with
her
when
she
came
back
and
oh
douglas
she
said
he
had
a
small
box
and
he
threatend
to
her
soul
with
its
contents
douglas
could
he
have
had
her
soul
let
me
think
said
douglas
i
met
professor
tickner
and
wills
coming
from
his
offices
a
few
days
ago
while
he
just
back
from
a
trip
that
he
did
tell
me
he
was
taking
you
mean
tickner
the
scientist
wills
the
surgeon
yes
answered
douglas
but
those
children
are
they
perfectly
healthy
they
look
it
lord
leslie
cried
douglas
i
have
it
he
made
good
his
threat
he
has
frozen
her
soul
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
go
to
her
leslie
douglas
tell
me
she
demanded
i
ca
said
douglas
i
may
be
mistaken
i
think
i
am
not
but
there
is
always
a
chance
drive
to
the
minturn
residence
he
ordered
they
found
a
closed
dark
pile
of
stone
go
past
that
place
where
the
children
were
again
said
leslie
the
upper
story
was
quiet
outlined
by
veranda
lights
the
massive
form
of
james
minturn
paced
back
and
forth
under
the
big
trees
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
his
head
bowed
and
he
walked
alone
douglas
i
going
to
speak
to
him
i
going
to
tell
him
declared
leslie
but
you
now
conceding
that
saw
him
douglas
pointed
out
then
what
have
you
to
tell
him
that
she
would
not
if
she
move
him
with
what
she
said
and
while
you
do
know
his
side
what
could
you
say
to
him
nothing
she
conceded
precisely
my
opinion
said
douglas
remember
leslie
i
am
a
little
ahead
of
you
in
this
you
know
side
i
know
all
you
have
told
me
of
her
also
i
know
what
he
has
told
me
while
putting
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
at
the
office
and
him
here
with
the
boys
in
a
house
she
would
consider
too
plebeian
for
words
no
douglas
no
she
is
changed
cried
leslie
completely
changed
i
tell
you
she
said
she
would
wipe
malcolm
nose
and
fix
studs
mere
figures
of
speech
remarked
douglas
they
meant
she
was
ready
to
work
with
her
own
hands
for
happiness
said
leslie
indignantly
i
think
she
too
late
said
douglas
i
am
afraid
she
is
one
of
the
unhappiest
women
in
the
world
douglas
it
wrings
my
heart
cried
leslie
mine
also
but
what
can
we
do
he
answered
for
ten
years
she
has
persisted
in
having
her
way
you
tell
me
what
could
she
have
expected
that
he
would
have
some
heart
protested
leslie
that
he
would
forgive
when
he
was
asked
as
all
of
us
are
commanded
to
does
it
occur
to
you
that
he
might
have
confronted
her
with
something
that
prevented
her
from
asking
suggested
douglas
she
may
never
have
reached
her
flowers
and
her
proposed
concessions
what
makes
you
think
so
queried
leslie
what
i
see
and
surmise
and
a
thing
i
know
what
can
i
do
asked
leslie
nothing
douglas
said
with
finality
if
either
of
them
wants
you
they
know
where
to
find
you
but
you
tired
now
let
give
the
order
for
home
sha
sleep
a
wink
prophesied
leslie
i
was
afraid
of
that
exclaimed
douglas
there
may
be
a
message
there
for
you
that
will
be
a
comfort
so
there
may
be
let
hurry
urged
the
girl
there
was
they
found
a
brief
pencilled
note
dear
leslie
it
was
due
you
to
send
a
word
you
tried
so
hard
dear
and
you
gave
me
real
joy
for
an
hour
then
james
carried
out
his
threat
he
did
all
to
me
he
intended
and
more
than
he
can
ever
know
i
have
agreed
to
him
taking
full
possession
of
the
boys
and
going
into
a
home
such
as
he
thinks
suitable
they
will
be
far
better
off
and
since
they
scarcely
know
me
they
ca
miss
me
before
you
receive
this
i
shall
have
left
the
city
i
ca
state
just
now
where
i
am
going
or
what
i
shall
do
you
can
realize
a
little
of
my
condition
if
ever
you
are
tired
of
home
life
and
faintly
tempted
to
neglect
it
for
society
use
me
for
your
horrible
example
nellie
minturn
leslie
read
this
aloud
it
a
relief
to
know
that
much
she
said
with
a
deep
breath
i
ca
imagine
myself
ever
being
tempted
but
if
i
am
surely
she
is
right
about
the
example
douglas
whatever
did
james
minturn
have
in
that
box
i
could
tell
you
what
i
surmise
but
so
long
as
i
do
better
not
he
answered
as
our
mutual
friend
mickey
would
say
on
the
swell
dames
for
me
said
leslie
determinedly
thank
god
with
all
my
heart
cried
douglas
bruce
chapter
viii
i
no
time
to
talk
said
douglas
bruce
as
mickey
appeared
the
following
day
my
work
seems
too
much
for
one
man
can
you
help
me
sure
said
mickey
wadding
his
cap
into
his
back
pocket
then
he
rolled
his
sleeves
a
turn
higher
lifted
his
chin
a
trifle
and
stepped
forward
say
what
it
caught
douglas
so
suddenly
there
was
no
time
for
concealment
he
laughed
heartily
that
good
he
cried
mickey
grinned
in
comradeship
first
these
letters
to
the
box
in
the
hall
next
mickey
queried
as
he
came
through
the
door
this
package
to
the
room
of
the
clerk
in
the
city
hall
and
bring
back
a
receipt
bearing
his
signature
mickey
saluted
laid
the
note
inside
the
cover
of
a
book
put
it
in
the
middle
of
the
package
and
a
second
later
his
gay
whistle
receded
down
the
hall
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
douglas
quoted
mickey
has
been
trained
until
he
would
make
a
good
trainer
himself
in
the
time
the
trip
had
taken
the
messenger
boys
douglas
was
accustomed
to
employing
mickey
was
back
like
the
gulf
in
the
forum
demanding
more
see
what
you
can
do
for
these
rooms
until
the
next
errand
is
ready
suggested
douglas
mickey
began
gathering
up
the
morning
papers
straightening
the
rugs
curtains
and
arranging
the
furniture
hand
this
check
to
the
janitor
said
douglas
and
mickey
kindly
ask
him
if
two
dollars
was
what
i
agreed
to
pay
him
for
my
extras
this
week
sure
said
mickey
douglas
would
have
preferred
yes
sir
but
sure
was
a
permanent
ejaculation
decorating
the
tip
of
mickey
tongue
the
man
watching
closely
did
not
fail
to
catch
the
flash
of
interest
and
the
lifting
of
the
boy
figure
as
he
paused
for
instructions
when
he
returned
douglas
said
casually
while
i
am
at
it
i
pay
off
my
messenger
service
take
this
check
to
the
address
and
bring
a
receipt
for
the
amount
mickey
comment
came
swiftly
gee
that
boy
would
be
sore
if
he
lost
his
job
messenger
service
agency
douglas
said
busy
at
his
desk
no
boy
would
lose
his
job
oh
exclaimed
mickey
comprehendingly
his
face
lighted
at
the
information
next
he
carried
a
requisition
for
books
to
another
city
official
and
telephoned
a
café
to
deliver
a
pitcher
of
lemonade
and
some
small
cakes
and
handed
the
boy
a
dime
why
did
you
send
me
and
save
your
silver
i
did
not
think
answered
bruce
some
one
gets
the
tip
you
might
as
well
have
had
it
i
did
mean
me
it
i
meant
you
it
mickey
said
douglas
you
know
perfectly
i
ca
take
your
time
unless
you
accept
from
me
what
i
am
accustomed
to
paying
other
boys
letting
others
bleed
you
you
mean
said
mickey
indignantly
why
glad
to
brought
the
juice
for
five
you
never
ought
to
paid
more
should
have
paid
more
corrected
douglas
have
paid
more
repeated
mickey
thanks
now
try
this
said
douglas
filling
two
glasses
usual
said
mickey
you
drink
that
yourself
or
save
it
for
friends
that
may
drop
in
very
well
said
douglas
of
course
you
might
have
it
instead
of
the
boy
who
comes
after
the
pitcher
but
if
you
do
like
it
all
right
if
that
the
way
agreed
mickey
he
retired
to
a
window
seat
enjoyed
the
cool
drink
and
nibbled
the
cake
his
eyes
deeply
thoughtful
when
offered
a
second
glass
mickey
did
not
hesitate
nope
he
said
conclusively
a
fellow
head
and
heels
work
better
when
his
stomach
is
running
light
i
can
earn
more
not
to
load
up
with
a
lot
of
stuff
i
eat
at
home
when
my
work
is
finished
she
showed
me
that
she
showed
you
a
good
many
things
did
she
sure
said
mickey
she
was
my
mother
so
we
had
to
look
out
for
ourselves
when
you
got
nothing
but
yourself
between
you
and
the
wolf
you
learn
to
fly
and
keep
your
in
running
order
she
knew
just
what
was
coming
to
me
so
she
me
and
single
thing
she
said
has
come
and
then
some
i
see
said
douglas
a
wise
mother
sure
agreed
mickey
but
i
guess
it
would
have
done
either
of
us
much
good
if
i
had
remembered
and
kept
straight
on
doing
what
she
taught
me
you
are
right
it
would
conceded
douglas
that
where
i
going
to
climb
above
some
of
the
other
fellows
announced
mickey
confidently
either
they
did
have
mothers
to
teach
them
or
else
they
did
and
forget
or
think
the
teaching
was
worth
anything
now
me
i
she
was
right
she
always
it
she
had
been
up
against
it
longer
than
i
had
and
she
knew
so
i
am
going
to
go
right
along
doing
as
she
said
i
beat
them
and
carry
double
at
that
how
double
mickey
inquired
douglas
i
did
mean
to
say
that
he
explained
that
was
a
slip
a
there
something
something
i
trying
to
do
that
costs
more
than
it
does
to
live
i
bound
to
do
it
so
i
got
to
run
light
and
keep
my
lamps
polished
for
chances
what
next
sir
call
and
order
my
car
here
said
douglas
he
bent
over
his
papers
to
hide
his
face
when
from
an
adjoining
room
drifted
mickey
voice
in
clear
enunciation
and
suave
intonation
douglas
bruce
desires
his
car
to
be
sent
immediately
to
the
iroquois
building
his
mental
comment
was
the
little
scamp
has
drifted
to
street
lingo
when
he
lacked
his
mother
to
restrain
him
he
can
speak
a
fairly
clean
grade
of
english
now
if
he
chooses
next
briskly
inquired
mickey
now
look
here
said
douglas
this
is
a
horse
race
i
earn
my
living
with
my
brains
not
my
heels
i
must
have
time
to
think
things
out
when
your
next
job
arrives
i
tell
you
if
you
are
tired
take
a
nap
on
that
couch
in
there
asleep
at
the
switch
marvelled
mickey
he
went
to
the
adjoining
room
but
did
not
sleep
he
quietly
polished
and
straightened
furniture
lingered
before
bookcases
and
was
at
douglas
elbow
as
he
turned
to
call
him
then
they
closed
the
offices
and
went
to
the
car
each
carrying
a
load
of
ledgers
you
do
an
awful
business
commented
mickey
your
car
yes
answered
douglas
you
doing
grand
for
young
as
you
are
i
have
done
it
all
myself
mickey
explained
douglas
i
happened
to
select
a
father
who
was
of
an
acquisitive
turn
of
mind
he
left
me
enough
that
i
can
have
a
comfortable
living
in
a
small
way
from
him
gee
it
lucky
you
got
the
joy
lady
then
exclaimed
mickey
maybe
you
would
ever
work
if
you
did
have
her
to
scratch
for
i
always
have
worked
and
tried
to
make
something
of
myself
said
douglas
yes
i
guess
you
have
conceded
mickey
i
think
it
shows
when
a
man
does
it
just
shows
a
lot
on
you
thank
you
mickey
same
to
you
aw
nix
on
me
said
mickey
i
ai
nothing
on
looks
i
ai
ever
looked
at
myself
enough
that
if
i
was
sent
to
find
michael
i
might
bring
in
some
other
fellow
but
you
enough
acquainted
with
yourself
that
you
would
bring
in
a
dirty
boy
with
a
mouth
full
of
swearing
and
beer
suggested
douglas
well
not
this
evening
cried
mickey
on
a
gamble
that
ai
my
picture
if
it
were
you
would
be
here
said
douglas
no
nor
much
of
any
place
else
the
gutters
alleys
and
the
police
court
affirmed
mickey
that
ai
my
style
i
like
to
be
well
about
like
you
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
all
i
have
and
am
said
douglas
if
you
fail
to
take
advantage
of
the
offer
it
will
be
your
own
fault
yes
i
guess
it
will
reflected
mickey
you
gave
me
the
chance
i
am
to
blame
if
i
do
cop
on
to
it
and
get
in
the
game
i
like
you
fine
your
work
is
more
interesting
than
odd
jobs
on
the
street
and
you
pay
like
a
plute
you
being
worked
though
you
pay
too
much
if
i
work
for
you
it
would
save
you
money
to
let
me
manage
that
i
could
get
you
help
and
things
a
lot
cheaper
then
you
could
spend
what
you
save
on
the
joy
lady
making
her
more
joyous
you
are
calling
miss
winton
the
joy
lady
yes
said
mickey
does
she
just
look
it
she
surely
does
agreed
douglas
it
a
good
title
i
know
only
two
that
are
better
she
sows
happiness
everywhere
what
about
your
lily
girl
and
her
doll
doll
does
go
that
a
precious
child
i
see
lily
is
a
little
girl
you
like
mickey
lily
is
the
littlest
girl
you
ever
saw
answered
mickey
with
a
bad
back
so
that
she
has
ever
walked
and
she
so
sweet
she
the
only
thing
i
got
to
love
so
i
love
her
it
hurts
her
back
is
one
thing
i
saving
for
i
going
to
have
it
carreled
as
soon
as
i
get
money
and
she
grows
strong
enough
to
stand
it
queried
douglas
wonderingly
you
know
the
man
who
put
different
legs
on
a
dog
said
mickey
i
often
read
about
him
in
papers
i
sell
i
think
he
can
fix
her
back
but
not
yet
a
sunshine
nurse
i
know
says
nobody
can
help
her
back
she
grows
a
lot
stronger
and
fatter
she
has
to
have
milk
and
be
rubbed
with
oil
and
not
be
jerked
for
a
while
before
it
any
use
to
begin
on
her
back
and
has
she
the
milk
and
the
oil
and
the
kindness
you
just
bet
she
has
said
mickey
her
family
tends
to
that
and
she
has
got
a
bed
and
a
window
and
her
precious
child
and
a
slate
and
books
that
all
right
then
said
douglas
any
time
you
see
she
needs
anything
mickey
i
be
glad
if
you
would
tell
me
or
miss
winton
she
loves
to
do
kind
things
to
little
sick
children
to
make
them
happier
so
do
i
said
mickey
and
lily
is
job
but
that
is
robbing
miss
joy
lady
she
can
love
herself
to
death
if
she
wants
to
on
hundreds
of
little
sick
cold
miserable
children
in
every
cellar
and
garret
and
tenement
of
the
east
end
of
multiopolis
the
only
kind
thing
god
did
for
them
out
there
was
to
give
them
the
first
chance
at
sunrise
multiopolis
has
ever
followed
his
example
by
giving
them
anything
you
mean
miss
winton
can
find
some
other
child
to
love
and
care
for
asked
douglas
sure
said
mickey
emphatically
it
hands
off
lily
her
family
is
taking
care
of
her
so
she
got
all
she
needs
right
now
that
good
said
bruce
here
we
unload
they
entered
a
building
and
exchanged
the
books
they
carried
for
others
which
douglas
selected
with
care
then
returning
to
the
office
locked
them
in
a
safe
now
i
am
driving
to
the
golf
grounds
for
an
hour
play
said
douglas
will
you
go
and
caddy
for
me
i
never
did
i
do
know
how
answered
mickey
you
can
learn
ca
you
suggested
douglas
sure
said
mickey
i
seen
boys
carrying
golf
clubs
that
enough
sense
to
break
stone
right
i
can
learn
but
my
learning
might
spoil
your
day
sport
it
would
be
no
big
price
to
pay
for
an
intelligent
caddy
replied
douglas
bruce
what
price
is
an
intelligent
caddy
worth
our
scotch
club
pays
fifty
cents
a
game
and
each
man
employs
his
own
boy
if
he
chooses
the
club
used
to
furnish
boys
but
since
the
big
brother
movement
began
so
many
of
the
men
have
boys
in
their
offices
they
are
accustomed
to
and
want
to
give
a
run
over
the
hills
after
the
day
work
that
the
rule
has
been
changed
i
can
employ
you
if
you
want
to
serve
me
i
go
to
the
in
the
car
with
you
every
day
you
play
and
carry
your
clubs
asked
mickey
wonderingly
yes
answered
douglas
over
real
hills
where
there
trees
grass
cows
and
water
questioned
mickey
yes
repeated
douglas
what
time
would
we
get
back
he
asked
depends
on
how
late
i
play
and
whether
i
have
dinner
at
the
club
house
say
seven
as
a
rule
maybe
ten
or
later
at
times
nothing
doing
said
mickey
promptly
i
got
to
be
home
at
six
by
the
clock
every
day
even
if
we
were
engaged
in
back
the
enemy
see
but
mickey
that
spoils
everything
cried
douglas
of
course
you
could
work
for
me
the
remainder
of
the
day
if
you
wanted
to
and
i
could
keep
my
old
clubhouse
caddy
but
i
want
you
want
the
ride
in
the
country
you
want
the
walk
you
the
change
and
recreation
you
are
not
a
real
boy
if
you
do
want
that
i
so
real
i
two
boys
if
it
counts
but
it
does
said
mickey
you
see
i
got
a
for
evening
i
promised
rather
do
what
you
want
than
anything
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
except
just
this
i
given
my
word
and
i
depended
on
i
could
give
up
this
work
and
i
would
if
i
could
even
golf
ai
in
it
with
this
job
that
i
on
what
is
your
work
mickey
oh
i
ai
ever
exactly
certain
said
mickey
sometimes
it
is
one
thing
sometimes
it
is
another
but
always
it
something
and
work
for
a
party
i
could
disappoint
not
noways
not
for
all
the
golf
in
the
world
you
are
sure
persisted
douglas
dead
sure
with
no
changing
said
mickey
all
right
then
i
sorry
exclaimed
douglas
so
am
i
said
mickey
but
not
about
the
job
douglas
laughed
well
come
along
this
evening
and
look
on
i
be
back
before
six
and
i
run
you
where
we
did
last
night
if
that
is
close
your
home
thanks
said
mickey
i
love
to
but
you
need
bother
about
taking
me
home
i
can
make
it
if
i
start
at
six
shall
i
take
the
things
back
to
the
café
let
them
go
until
morning
said
douglas
what
becomes
of
the
little
cakes
their
fate
is
undecided
have
you
any
suggestions
i
should
worry
he
exclaimed
they
fit
my
pocket
i
could
hike
past
the
hospital
and
ask
the
sunshine
lady
if
she
said
so
i
could
take
them
to
lily
bet
she
never
tasted
any
like
them
if
it
between
her
and
the
café
selling
them
over
she
takes
the
cake
mickey
face
was
one
big
insinuating
suggestive
smile
douglas
was
another
suppose
she
does
he
agreed
i
must
wrap
them
said
mickey
have
to
be
careful
about
lily
if
she
fed
dirty
wrong
stuff
it
will
make
fever
so
her
back
will
get
worse
instead
of
better
will
a
clean
envelope
do
suggested
douglas
that
would
cost
you
two
cents
said
mickey
have
you
something
cheaper
what
about
a
sheet
of
paper
hazarded
douglas
fine
said
mickey
and
only
half
as
expensive
so
they
wrapped
the
little
cakes
and
closed
the
office
then
douglas
said
now
this
ends
work
for
the
day
next
comes
playtime
then
before
we
begin
to
play
we
ought
to
finish
business
said
mickey
i
have
been
thinking
over
what
you
said
the
other
day
and
while
i
was
right
about
some
of
it
i
was
mistaken
about
part
i
changing
anything
i
said
about
minturn
men
and
his
sort
and
millyingaire
men
and
their
sort
but
you
ai
that
kind
of
a
man
thank
you
mickey
said
douglas
no
you
ai
that
of
a
man
continued
mickey
and
you
are
just
the
kind
of
a
man
i
to
be
so
if
the
door
ai
shut
guess
i
stick
around
afternoons
not
all
day
inquired
douglas
well
you
see
i
am
in
the
paper
business
and
that
takes
all
morning
explained
mickey
i
can
always
finish
my
first
batch
by
noon
lots
of
times
by
ten
from
that
on
to
six
i
could
work
for
you
do
you
think
you
could
earn
more
with
me
and
in
the
winter
at
least
be
more
comfortable
asked
douglas
winter
cried
mickey
his
face
whitening
yes
said
douglas
the
newsboys
always
look
frightfully
cold
in
winter
winter
it
was
a
piteous
cry
what
is
it
mickey
questioned
bruce
kindly
you
know
i
it
he
said
i
was
so
took
up
with
what
i
was
doing
and
thinking
right
now
that
i
forgot
a
time
ever
was
coming
when
it
gets
blue
cold
and
little
kids
freeze
gee
i
almost
wish
i
had
thought
of
it
i
guess
i
better
sell
my
paper
business
and
come
with
you
all
day
i
i
could
earn
more
i
just
sort
of
to
give
up
the
papers
i
been
at
them
so
long
i
had
such
a
good
time
like
to
sell
papers
that
the
way
i
always
start
my
cry
and
i
do
i
just
love
to
i
sell
to
about
the
same
bunch
every
morning
and
most
of
my
men
know
me
and
they
always
say
a
word
and
i
like
the
rush
and
excitement
and
the
things
that
happen
and
the
looking
for
chances
on
the
side
there
messenger
work
in
my
business
i
see
i
like
that
i
like
your
work
all
right
said
mickey
gim
me
a
few
days
to
sell
my
route
to
the
best
advantage
i
can
and
i
come
all
day
i
come
for
about
a
half
what
you
are
paying
now
but
you
admit
you
need
money
urgently
well
not
so
urgently
as
to
skin
a
friend
to
get
it
not
even
with
the
winter
i
had
thought
of
coming
gee
i
do
know
just
what
i
am
going
to
do
about
that
for
yourself
mickey
inquired
douglas
well
in
a
way
yes
hesitated
mickey
there
are
things
to
about
gee
i
got
to
hump
myself
while
the
sun
shines
if
you
say
so
then
i
get
out
of
the
paper
business
as
soon
as
i
can
and
begin
work
for
you
steady
at
noon
i
seen
you
pay
out
over
seven
i
come
for
six
is
it
a
bargain
no
said
douglas
it
is
the
janitor
bill
was
for
a
week
of
work
the
messenger
bill
was
for
two
days
no
caddying
at
all
if
you
come
you
will
come
for
not
less
than
eight
and
what
you
earn
extra
over
that
i
do
agree
to
better
service
for
less
pay
if
you
will
have
things
between
us
on
a
commercial
basis
so
will
i
oh
the
big
brother
business
would
be
all
right
with
you
conceded
mickey
but
i
do
just
like
the
way
it
managed
mostly
god
make
us
brothers
no
more
than
he
did
all
men
so
we
better
not
butt
in
and
try
to
fix
things
over
for
him
looks
to
me
like
we
might
cut
the
brother
business
and
just
be
i
could
be
an
awful
good
to
you
honest
i
could
and
i
to
you
mickey
said
douglas
bruce
holding
out
his
hand
have
it
as
you
will
friends
then
look
for
you
at
noon
now
we
play
hop
in
and
we
run
to
my
rooms
and
get
my
clubs
shall
i
sit
up
with
your
man
asked
mickey
my
friends
sit
beside
me
said
douglas
mickey
spoke
softly
yes
but
if
i
watched
him
sharp
maybe
i
could
get
the
hang
of
driving
for
you
think
what
a
lump
that
would
save
when
i
going
i
love
to
drive
just
for
the
fun
of
it
and
i
would
allow
you
to
drive
for
less
than
i
pay
him
said
douglas
i
do
see
why
exclaimed
mickey
when
you
grow
older
and
know
me
better
you
will
while
the
car
was
running
its
smoothest
while
the
country
mickey
had
not
seen
save
on
rare
newsboy
excursions
flashed
past
while
the
wonder
of
the
club
house
the
links
and
the
work
he
would
have
loved
to
do
developed
he
shivered
and
cried
in
his
tormented
little
soul
gee
how
will
i
ever
keep
lily
warm
douglas
noticed
his
abstraction
and
wondered
he
had
expected
more
appreciation
of
what
mickey
was
seeing
and
doing
he
was
coming
to
the
realization
that
he
would
find
out
what
was
in
the
boy
heart
in
his
own
time
and
way
on
the
home
run
when
douglas
reached
his
rooms
he
told
the
driver
to
take
mickey
to
the
end
of
the
car
line
the
boy
shyly
interposed
to
ask
if
he
might
go
to
the
star
of
hope
hospital
so
douglas
changed
the
order
mickey
passport
held
good
at
the
hospital
the
sunshine
nurse
inspected
the
cakes
and
approved
them
she
was
so
particular
she
even
took
a
tiny
nibble
of
one
and
said
sugar
flour
egg
and
shortening
all
right
mickey
those
ca
hurt
her
and
how
is
she
fine
cried
mickey
she
is
getting
a
lot
stronger
already
she
can
sit
up
longer
and
help
herself
better
and
she
got
ribbons
the
prettiest
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
that
a
lady
gave
me
for
her
hair
and
they
make
her
pink
and
nicer
and
she
got
a
baby
doll
in
long
clean
white
dresses
to
snuggle
down
and
stay
with
her
all
day
and
she
got
a
slate
and
a
book
and
she
knows
and
and
my
name
and
she
is
learning
i
am
going
to
teach
her
and
she
can
say
her
prayer
too
nice
for
anything
once
we
got
it
fixed
so
she
say
it
at
all
what
did
you
teach
her
mickey
i
lay
me
only
lily
would
say
it
the
way
she
taught
me
you
see
lily
was
all
alone
with
her
granny
when
she
winked
out
and
it
scared
her
most
stiff
so
when
i
got
to
that
i
should
die
before
i
wake
line
she
just
went
into
fits
and
remembering
what
i
seen
myself
i
did
blame
her
so
i
changed
it
for
her
she
liked
it
tell
me
about
it
mickey
said
the
nurse
well
you
see
she
has
a
window
so
she
can
see
the
stars
and
the
sun
she
knows
them
so
i
just
shifted
the
old
sad
scary
lines
to
me
through
the
starry
night
wake
me
safe
with
sunshine
bright
but
mickey
that
lovely
cried
the
nurse
wait
till
i
write
it
down
i
teach
it
to
my
little
people
half
of
them
come
here
knowing
that
prayer
and
when
they
are
ill
they
begin
to
think
about
it
some
of
them
are
old
enough
to
worry
over
it
why
you
a
poet
mickey
sure
conceded
mickey
that
what
i
going
to
be
when
i
get
through
school
i
going
to
write
a
poetry
piece
about
lily
for
the
first
sheet
of
the
that
be
so
good
they
pay
me
to
write
one
every
day
but
all
of
them
will
be
about
her
mickey
is
there
enough
of
such
a
little
girl
to
furnish
one
every
day
asked
the
nurse
surest
thing
you
know
cried
mickey
enthusiastically
why
there
are
the
hundred
gold
rings
on
her
head
one
for
each
and
her
eyes
tender
and
teasy
and
sad
and
glad
one
for
each
and
the
colour
of
them
different
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
her
little
white
face
and
her
lips
and
her
smile
and
when
she
good
and
when
she
bad
why
miss
there
enough
of
lily
for
a
book
big
as
bruce
biggest
law
book
well
mickey
cried
the
girl
laughing
there
no
question
but
you
will
write
the
poetry
only
i
ca
reconcile
it
with
the
kind
of
a
hustler
you
are
i
thought
poets
were
languid
dreamy
kind
of
people
so
they
are
explained
mickey
comes
later
first
i
got
to
hustle
to
get
lily
back
carreled
and
us
through
school
and
ready
to
the
poetry
then
it
will
take
so
much
dreaming
to
think
out
what
is
nicest
about
her
and
how
to
say
it
best
that
it
would
make
any
fellow
languid
you
can
see
how
that
would
be
yes
i
see
conceded
the
nurse
mickey
by
carreling
her
back
do
you
mean
dr
carrel
sure
cried
mickey
you
see
i
read
a
lot
about
him
in
the
papers
i
sell
he
the
biggest
man
in
the
he
bigger
than
emperors
and
kings
they
why
the
biggest
thing
they
can
is
to
kill
all
their
strongest
bravest
men
he
so
much
bigger
than
kings
that
he
can
take
men
they
shoot
to
pieces
and
put
them
together
again
killing
men
ai
much
anybody
can
do
killing
look
at
him
making
folks
live
he
big
and
you
think
he
can
make
lily
back
better
why
i
he
can
said
mickey
earnestly
that
would
be
a
patching
to
what
he
done
soon
as
you
say
she
is
strong
enough
i
going
to
write
to
him
and
tell
him
all
about
her
and
when
i
get
the
money
saved
he
come
and
fix
her
sure
he
will
if
you
could
get
to
him
and
tell
him
yourself
i
really
believe
he
would
marvelled
the
nurse
but
you
see
it
like
this
mickey
when
men
are
as
great
as
he
is
just
thousands
of
people
want
everything
of
them
and
write
letters
by
the
hundreds
and
if
all
of
them
were
read
there
would
be
time
for
nothing
else
so
a
secretary
opens
the
mail
and
decides
what
is
important
and
that
way
the
big
people
do
always
know
about
the
ones
they
would
answer
if
they
were
doing
it
he
been
here
in
this
very
hospital
i
seen
him
operate
once
next
time
a
perfectly
wonderful
case
comes
in
that
is
in
his
peculiar
line
no
doubt
he
will
be
notified
and
come
again
then
if
i
could
get
word
to
you
and
you
could
get
lily
here
possibly
just
possibly
he
would
listen
to
you
and
look
at
her
of
course
i
ca
say
surely
he
would
but
i
think
he
would
why
of
course
he
would
triumphed
mickey
of
course
he
would
be
tickled
to
pieces
he
just
love
to
any
man
would
why
a
white
little
who
ca
walk
if
you
could
reach
him
i
really
think
he
would
said
the
nurse
positively
well
just
you
gim
me
a
hint
that
he
here
and
see
if
i
do
get
to
him
said
mickey
is
there
any
place
i
be
certain
to
find
you
quickly
if
a
chance
should
come
she
asked
one
never
can
tell
he
might
not
be
here
in
years
but
he
might
be
called
and
come
why
yes
cried
mickey
why
of
course
why
the
telephone
call
me
where
i
work
but
i
thought
you
were
a
said
the
nurse
well
i
was
explained
mickey
lifting
his
head
but
i
give
up
the
papers
i
graduated
i
going
to
sell
out
tomorrow

going
to
work
permanent
for
douglas

of
having
the
nerve
to

him
i
do
get
up
against
it
my
head
swims
and
there
is
coming
too
the
nurse
put
her
arm
around
mickey
again
and
gently
propelled
him
toward
the
elevator
mickey
she
said
softly
her
lips
nipping
his
fair
hair
god
give
many
of
us
your
clear
vision
and
your
big
heart
i
have
asked
him
that
with
never
a
thought
of
who
would
have
to
be
ill
to
bring
carrel
here
but
i
tell
you
you
can
pray
with
a
clean
conscience
you
can
ask
god
if
the
doctor
come
to
put
it
into
his
heart
to
hear
you
and
to
examine
lily
that
would
be
asking
ill
for
anyone
else
so
that
you
might
profit
by
it
and
dear
laddie
worry
about
this
city
is
still
taking
care
of
its
taxpayers
you
do
your
best
for
lily
all
summer
and
when
winter
comes
if
not
fixed
for
it
i
will
see
what
your
share
is
and
you
can
have
it
in
a
stove
that
will
burn
warm
a
whole
day
and
lots
of
coal
of
it
i
know
i
can
arrange
that
gee
you
great
he
cried
this
is
the
biggest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
i
see
now
what
i
can
ask
him
on
the
square
so
and
all
right
and
bruce
or
miss
leslie
will
loan
me
a
car
and
if
you
see
about
the
stove
and
the
coal
the
city
has
for
me
in
came
mickey
royal
flourish
why
dearest
nurse
lady
lily
is
as
good
as
walking
right
now
gee
in
my
place
would
you
tell
her
i
surely
would
said
the
nurse
it
will
do
her
good
it
will
give
her
hope
carrel
is
the
only
one
who
can
perform
miracles
if
he
come
by
the
time
lily
is
strong
enough
to
bear
the
strain
of
being
operated
we
can
try
some
other
great
man
and
if
she
is
shy
and
timid
from
having
been
alone
so
much
expecting
it
will
make
it
easier
for
her
by
the
way
wait
until
i
bring
some
little
gifts
i
and
three
of
my
friends
have
made
for
her
in
our
spare
time
i
think
your
mother
night
dresses
must
be
big
and
uncomfortable
for
her
even
as
you
cut
them
off
try
these
give
her
a
fresh
one
each
day
it
is
going
to
be
dreadfully
hot
soon
when
she
has
used
two
bring
them
here
and
i
have
them
washed
for
you
now
nix
on
that
said
mickey
you
a
shining
angel
bright
to
sew
them
for
her
i
crazy
over
them
but
i
wash
them
mother
showed
me
that
will
be
share
i
can
do
it
fine
and
they
be
better
she
so
lost
in
mother
i
have
to
shake
them
to
find
her
they
laughed
together

mickey
sped
to
the
sidewalk
and
ordered
the
car

it
mickey
flushed
and
grinned
in
embarrassment
when
people
half
a
block
away
turned
to
look
at
his
driver
and
the
boy
mouth
opened
as
a
traffic
policeman
smiled
in
sympathy
when
he
waved
his
club
signalling
them
to
cross
mickey
straightened
up
reassured

inquired

the
driver

over
promised
the
driver
mickey
hurried
home
to
peaches
he
hid
the
cake
and
the
hospital
box
under
the
things
he
bought
for
supper
and
went
to
her
with
empty
hands
he
could
see
she
was
tired
and
hungry
so
he
gave
her
a
drink
of
milk
and
proceeded
to
the
sponge
bath
and
oil
rub
these
rested
and
refreshed
her
so
that
mickey
demanded
closed
eyes
while
he
slipped
the
dainty
over
her
head
and
tied
the
pink
ribbon
on
her
curls
then
he
piled
the
pillows
leaned
her
against
them
and
brought
the
mirror
now
open
your
peepers
and
tell
me
how
miss
strikes
you
he
exulted
peaches
took
one
long
look
she
opened
her
mouth
then
she
turned
to
mickey
and
shut
her
mouth
shut
it
and
clapped
both
hands
over
it
so
that
he
saw
the
very
act
of
strangling
a
phrase
he
would
have
condemned
that
a
nice
lady
he
commented
in
joy
now
let
me
tell
you
you
got
four
of
these
gorgeous
garments
each
one
made
by
a
different
while
she
was
resting
every
day

get
a
clean
one
and
i
wash
the
one
you
wore
last
careful
and
easy
not
to
tear
the
lacy
places
ai
they
the
gladdest
rags
you
ever
saw
peaches
gasped
mickey
i
bust
go
on
and
bust
then
conceded
mickey
bust
if
you
must
but
you
dare
say
no
words
that
ai
for
the
ladiest
of
ladies
in
that
beautiful
softy
white
dress
peaches
set
her
lips
stretching
her
arms
widely
she
sat
straighter
than
mickey
ever
had
seen
her
lifting
her
head
higher
gradually
a
smile
crept
over
her
face
she
was
seeing
a
very
pinched
white
little
girl
with
a
shower
of
yellow
curls
bound
with
a
pink
ribbon
tied
in
a
big
bow
wearing
a
dainty
night
dress
with
a
fancy
yoke
run
with
pink
ribbons
tied
under
her
chin
and
at
her
elbows
she
crooked
an
arm
primped
her
mouth
and
peered
at
the
puffed
sleeves
then
hastily
gulped
down
whatever
she
had
been
tempted
to
say
again
mickey
approved
despite
protests
he
removed
the
mirror
then
put
the
doll
in
her
arms
now
you
line
up
he
said
now
you
look
alike
after
you
get
your
supper

joy

for

joyous
than
this
peaches
surveyed
herself
yes

the
joyousest
thing
of
all
the
world
that

happen
to
you
he
said
but
she
cried
in
protest

mickey
i
do
believe
it
it
never
could
she
cried
there

demanded
i

ordered
the
child
well

a

until
she
made
me
snicker
if
she
had
wings
she
could
fly
she
be
too
stubborn
to
a
belligerent
look
slowly
spread
over
peaches
face

scoffed

i

it
if

i
would
i
had
my
piece
in
consideration
of

poetry
piece
mickey
desisted
the
inference
was
too
flattering
between
narrowed
lids
he
looked
at
lily
you
fool
sweet
little
kid
he
muttered
then
he
prepared
supper
when
he
set
it
on
the
table
he
bent
over
and
taking
both
hands
he
said
gently
of
moonbeam
white
golden
head
of
sunshine
bright
dancing
eyes
of
sky
own
blue
no
other
flower
in
the
world
like
get
the
slate
cried
peaches
get
the
slate
now
a
piece
that
the
best
one
yet
i
going
to
put
that
right
under
the
cow
sure
said
mickey
i
think
that
the
best
yet
myself
you
see
you
make
them
come
better
every
time
you
get
so
much
sweeter
every
day
then
why
did
you
make
the
bad
one
she
pouted
well
every
time
you
just
yell
wo
without
ever
giving
me
a
chance
to
tell
you
i
going
to
do
or
why
explained
mickey
if
only
you
learn
to
wait
a
little
you
do
better
if
i
was
to
tell
you
that
carrel
man
was
at
the
door
with
a
new
back
for
you
if
you
turn
over
and
let
him
put
it
in
i
you
yell
wo
the
first
tinge
of
colour
mickey
had
seen
almost
invisibly
faint
crept
to
the
surface
of
peaches
white
cheek
just
you
try
it
she
exclaimed
finish
your
supper
and
see
what
i
try
peaches
obeyed
she
had
stopped
grabbing
and
cramming
she
ate
slowly
masticating
each
morsel
as
the
nurse
told
mickey
she
should
he
found
her
so
dainty
and
charming
as
she
instinctively
tried
to
be
as
nice
as
her
dress
and
supper
demanded
that
he
forgot
himself
until
she
reminded
him
then
he
rallied
and
ate
his
share
he
presented
the
cakes
and
while
they
enjoyed
them
he
described
every
detail
of
the
day
he
thought
would
interest
her
until
she
had
finished
he
told
her
of
the
nurse
and
the
dresses
and
when
she
wanted
to
see
the
others
he

but
if
the

back
she
pursued

mickey

silly
give
the
man
some
chance
chapter
ix
and
nellie
minturn
returned
to
her
room
too
dazed
to
realize
her
suffering
she
had
intended
doing
something
the
fringed
orchids
reminded
her
she
rang
for
water
to
put
them
in
while
her
maid
with
shaking
fingers
dressed
her
then
ordered
the
car
the
girl
understood
that
some
terrible
thing
had
happened
and
offered
to
go
with
the
woman
who
moved
so
mechanically
she
proved
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
doing
no
said
minturn
no
the
little
soul
has
been
out
there
a
long
time
alone
her
mother
had
better
go
alone
and
see
how
it
is
she
entered
the
car
gave
her
order
and
sank
back
against
the
seat
when
the
car
stopped
she
descended
and
found
the
gates
guarding
the
doors
of
the
onyx
vault
locked
she
pushed
her
flowers
between
the
bars
dropping
them
before
the
doors
then
wearily
sank
on
the
first
step
leaning
her
head
against
the
gate
trying
to
think
but
she
could
not
near
dawn
her
driver
spoke
to
her
it
almost
morning
he
said
you
barely
time
to
reach
home
before
the
city
will
be
stirring
she
paid
no
attention
so
at
last
he
touched
her
you
weston
she
asked
yes
madam
he
said
i
afraid
for
you
i
ventured
to
come
closer
than
you
said
excuse
me
thank
you
weston
she
answered
let
me
drive
you
home
now
madam
he
begged
just
where
would
you
take
me
if
you
were
taking
me
home
weston
where
we
came
from
he
replied
do
you
think
that
has
ever
been
a
home
weston
i
have
thought
it
the
finest
home
in
multiopolis
madam
said
the
driver
in
surprise
she
laughed
bitterly
so
have
i
weston
and
i
have
learned
what
it
really
is
help
me
weston
take
me
back
to
the
home
of
my
making
when
he
rang
for
her
she
gave
him
an
order
find
john
haynes
and
bring
him
here
immediately
bring
him
now
madam
he
questioned
immediately
i
said
she
repeated
i
will
try
madam
said
weston
you
will
bring
him
at
once
if
he
is
in
multiopolis
she
said
with
finality
weston
knew
that
john
haynes
was
her
lawyer
he
had
brought
him
from
his
residence
or
office
at
her
order
many
times
he
brought
him
again
at
once
john
haynes
dismissed
all
the
servants
in
the
minturn
household
arranged
everything
necessary
and
saw
minturn
aboard
a
train
in
company
with
a
new
maid
of
his
selection
then
he
mailed
a
deed
of
gift
of
the
minturn
residence
to
the
city
of
multiopolis
for
an
endowed
children
hospital
the
morning
papers
briefly
announced
the
departure
and
the
gift
at
his
breakfast
table
james
minturn
read
both
items
then
sat
in
deep
thought
not
like
her
was
his
mental
comment
i
can
understand
how
that
place
would
become
intolerable
to
her
but
i
never
knew
her
to
give
a
dollar
to
the
suffering
now
she
makes
a
princely
gift
not
because
she
is
generous
but
because
the
house
has
become
unbearable
and
as
usual
with
no
thought
of
any
one
save
herself
if
the
city
dares
accept
how
her
millionaire
neighbours
will
rage
at
disease
and
sickness
being
brought
into
the
finest
residence
district
probably
the
city
will
be
compelled
to
sell
it
and
build
somewhere
else
but
there
is
something
fitting
in
the
reparation
of
turning
a
building
that
has
been
a
place
of
torture
to
children
into
one
of
healing
it
proves
that
she
has
a
realizing
sense
he
glanced
around
the
bright
cheerful
breakfast
room
with
its
carefully
set
table
at
his
sister
at
its
head
at
a
son
on
either
hand
at
a
young
tutor
on
one
side
and
his
little
brother
on
the
other
for
so
had
james
minturn
ordered
his
household
winslow
had
left
a
home
she
loved
to
come
at
her
brother
urgent
call
for
help
to
save
his
boys
the
tutor
had
only
a
few
hours
of
his
position
and
thus
far
his
salary
seemed
the
attractive
feature
james
and
malcolm
were
too
dazed
to
be
natural
for
a
short
time
they
had
been
picked
up
bodily
and
carried
kicking
and
screaming
to
this
place
where
they
had
been
dressed
in
plain
durable
clothing
malcolm
bed
stood
beside
little
brother
in
a
big
sunny
room
james
was
near
the
tutor
in
a
chamber
the
counterpart
of
the
other
save
for
its
bookcases
lining
one
wall
there
was
a
schoolroom
not
yet
furnished
with
more
than
tables
and
chairs
its
floors
and
walls
bare
its
windows
having
shades
only
when
worn
out
with
the
struggle
the
amazed
boys
had
succumbed
to
sleep
on
little
hard
white
beds
with
plain
covers
had
awakened
to
a
cold
bath
at
the
hands
of
a
man
and
when
they
rebelled
and
called
for
lucette
and
their
accustomed
clothing
were
forcibly
dressed
in
linen
and
khaki
in
a
few
minutes
together
before
they
were
called
to
breakfast
james
had
confided
to
malcolm
that
he
thought
if
they
rushed
into
back
with
all
their
strength
on
the
top
step
they
could
roll
him
downstairs
and
bang
him
up
good
malcolm
had
doubts
but
he
was
willing
to
try
william
was
alert
because
as
many
another
newsy
he
had
known
these
boys
in
the
park
so
when
the
rush
came
a
movement
too
quick
for
untrained
eyes
to
follow
swung
him
around
a
newel
post
while
both
boys
bumping
screaming
rolled
to
the
first
landing
and
rebounded
from
a
wall
harder
than
they
when
no
one
hastened
at
their
screams
to
pick
them
up
they
arose
fighting
each
other
the
tutor
passed
and
james
tried
to
kick
him
merely
because
he
could
he
was
not
there
either
but
he
stopped
for
this
advice
to
the
astonished
boy
if
i
were
you
i
would
do
that
this
is
a
free
country
and
if
you
have
a
right
to
kick
me
i
have
the
same
right
to
kick
you
i
would
like
to
do
it
i
rather
allow
mules
and
vicious
horses
to
do
the
kicking
still
if
you
bound
to
kick
i
can
but
my
foot
is
so
much
bigger
than
yours
and
if
i
forgot
and
took
you
for
a
football
you
probably
have
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
lie
in
a
plaster
cast
a
week
or
so
if
i
were
you
i
would
let
go
watch
the
birds
till
breakfast
is
called
instead
the
invitation
was
not
accepted
the
tutor
descended
alone
as
he
stepped
to
the
veranda
he
met
minturn
well
that
gentleman
asked
tersely
tower
shook
his
head
he
was
studying
law
he
needed
money
to
complete
his
course
he
needed
many
things
he
could
acquire
from
james
minturn
it
a
problem
he
said
guardedly
you
draw
your
salary
for
its
solution
minturn
said
tartly
work
on
the
theory
i
outlined
if
it
fails
after
a
fair
test
we
try
another
those
boys
have
got
to
be
saved
they
are
handsome
little
chaps
with
fine
bodies
and
good
ancestry
what
happened
just
now
they
tried
to
rush
william
on
the
top
step
william
evaporated
so
they
took
the
fall
themselves
exactly
right
commented
minturn
get
the
idea
and
work
on
it
every
rough
heartless
thing
they
attempt
if
at
all
possible
make
it
a
boomerang
to
strike
them
their
own
blow
but
you
reserve
blows
as
a
last
resort
there
is
the
bell
minturn
called
boys
the
breakfast
bell
is
ringing
come
there
was
not
a
sound
minturn
nodded
to
the
tutor
together
they
ascended
the
stairs
they
found
the
boys
hidden
in
a
wardrobe
minturn
opened
the
door
gravely
looking
at
them
boys
he
said
you
going
to
live
with
me
after
this
so
you
to
come
when
i
call
you
you
going
to
eat
the
food
that
makes
of
boys
where
i
can
see
what
you
get
you
are
going
to
do
what
i
believe
best
for
you
until
you
are
so
educated
that
you
are
capable
of
thinking
for
yourselves
now
what
you
must
do
is
to
come
downstairs
and
take
your
places
at
the
table
if
you
do
feel
hungry
you
need
eat
but
i
would
advise
you
to
make
a
good
meal
i
intend
to
send
you
to
the
country
in
the
car
you
soon
want
food
with
me
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
lunch
at
any
hour
in
cafes
and
restaurants
if
you
do
eat
your
breakfast
you
will
get
nothing
until
noon
it
is
up
to
you
come
on
neither
boy
moved
minturn
smiled
at
them
the
sooner
you
quit
this
the
sooner
all
of
us
will
be
comfortable
he
said
casually
observe
my
size
see
tower
a
college
athlete
who
will
teach
you
ball
football
tennis
swimming
in
lakes
and
riding
all
the
things
that
make
boys
manly
men
better
stop
sulking
in
a
closet
and
show
your
manhood
with
one
finger
either
of
us
can
lift
you
out
and
carry
you
down
by
force
and
we
will
but
why
not
be
gentlemen
and
walk
down
as
we
do
both
boys
looked
at
him
then
at
each
other
but
remained
where
they
were
time
is
up
said
minturn
they
had
their
chance
tower
if
they
wo
take
it
they
must
suffer
the
consequences
take
malcolm
i
bring
james
instantly
both
boys
began
to
fight
no
one
bribed
them
to
stop
struck
them
or
did
anything
at
all
according
to
precedent
they
raged
until
they
exposed
a
vulnerable
point
then
each
man
laid
hold
lifted
and
carefully
carried
down
a
boy
placing
him
on
a
chair
james
instantly
slid
to
the
floor
take
james
chair
away
ordered
minturn
he
prefers
to
be
served
on
the
floor
malcolm
laughed
i
do
either
i
slipped
cried
james
then
excuse
yourself
resume
your
chair
and
be
mighty
careful
you
do
slip
again
james
looked
at
his
father
sullenly
but
at
last
muttered
excuse
me
and
took
the
chair
with
bright
inflamed
eyes
they
stared
at
their
almost
unknown
father
who
now
had
them
in
his
power
at
a
woman
they
scarcely
knew
whom
they
were
told
to
call
aunt
margaret
at
a
strange
man
who
was
to
take
lucette
place
and
who
had
a
grip
that
made
hers
seem
feeble
and
who
was
to
teach
them
the
things
of
which
they
knew
nothing
and
therefore
hated
and
at
a
boy
nearer
their
own
size
and
years
whom
their
father
called
william
both
boys
refused
fruit
and
cereal
rudely
demanding
cake
and
ice
cream
margaret
winslow
looked
at
her
brother
in
despair
he
placidly
ate
his
breakfast
remarking
that
the
cook
was
a
treasure
as
he
left
the
table
minturn
laid
the
papers
before
his
sister
indicating
the
paragraphs
he
had
read
then
calling
for
his
car
he
took
the
tutor
and
the
boys
and
left
for
his
office
he
ordered
them
to
return
for
him
at
eleven
and
with
minute
instructions
as
to
how
they
were
to
proceed
tower
and
william
drove
to
the
country
to
begin
the
breaking
in
of
the
minturn
boys
they
disdained
ball
did
not
care
for
football
improvised
golf
clubs
and
a
baseball
were
not
interesting
further
than
the
use
of
the
clubs
on
each
other
which
was
not
allowed
they
did
not
care
what
the
flowers
were
they
jerked
them
up
by
the
roots
when
they
saw
it
annoyed
tower
while
every
bird
in
range
flew
from
a
badly
aimed
stone
they
tried
chasing
a
flock
of
sheep
which
chased
beautifully
for
a
short
distance
then
a
ram
declined
to
run
farther
and
butted
the
breath
from
malcolm
small
body
until
it
had
to
be
shaken
in
again
they
ran
amuck
and
on
finding
they
were
not
pursued
gave
up
stopping
on
the
bank
of
a
creek
there
they
espied
tiny
shining
fish
swimming
through
the
water
and
plunged
in
to
try
to
capture
them
when
tower
and
william
came
up
both
boys
were
busy
chasing
fish
from
a
bank
where
they
sat
watching
came
a
proposal
from
william
i
tell
you
fellows
i
believe
if
we
could
build
a
dam
we
could
catch
them
gather
stones
and
pile
them
up
till
i
get
my
shoes
off
instantly
both
boys
obeyed
tower
and
william
stripped
their
feet
and
rolled
their
trousers
into
the
creek
they
went
setting
stones
packing
with
sod
and
muck
using
sticks
and
leaves
until
in
a
short
time
they
had
a
dam
before
which
the
water
began
rising
then
overflowing
now
we
must
wait
until
it
clears
said
william
so
they
sat
under
a
tree
to
watch
until
in
the
clean
pool
formed
they
could
see
little
fish
gathering
then
the
boys
lay
on
the
banks
and
tried
to
catch
them
with
their
hands
and
succeeded
in
getting
a
few
tower
suggested
they
should
make
pools
one
on
each
side
of
the
creek
for
their
fish
so
they
eagerly
went
to
work
they
pushed
and
slapped
each
other
they
fought
over
the
same
stone
but
each
constructed
with
his
own
hands
a
stone
and
mud
enclosed
pool
in
which
to
pen
his
fish
they
were
really
interested
in
what
they
were
doing
they
really
worked
also
soon
they
were
really
tired
they
were
really
hungry
with
imperative
voice
they
demanded
food
you
forget
what
your
father
told
you
at
breakfast
said
tower
he
knew
you
were
coming
to
the
country
where
you
could
get
food
william
and
i
are
not
hungry
we
want
to
catch
these
little
fish
and
see
who
can
get
the
most
we
think
it
fun
we
ca
take
the
car
back
until
your
father
said
to
come
you
take
us
back
right
now
and
order
meat
and
cake
and
salad
and
ice
cream
lots
of
it
stormed
james
i
have
to
obey
your
father
said
tower
i
just
hate
fathers
cried
james
i
wager
you
do
conceded
tower
james
stared
open
mouthed
i
can
see
how
you
feel
said
tower
companionably
when
a
fellow
has
been
coddled
by
nurses
all
his
life
has
no
muscle
no
appetite
except
for
the
things
he
should
have
and
never
has
done
anything
but
silly
it
must
be
a
great
change
to
be
out
with
men
and
doing
as
they
do
both
boys
were
listening
so
he
went
on
but
do
feel
badly
and
do
waste
breath
hating
save
it
for
the
grand
fun
we
are
going
to
have
and
next
time
good
food
is
before
you
eat
like
men
we
start
back
for
an
hour
yet
see
which
can
catch
the
most
fish
in
that
time
where
is
lucette
demanded
james
gone
back
to
her
home
across
the
ocean
you
never
see
her
again
said
tower
wish
i
could
her
head
before
she
went
said
james
regretfully
no
doubt
laughed
tower
but
break
your
own
and
see
how
it
feels
before
you
try
it
on
any
one
else
i
wish
i
could
break
yours
cried
james
angrily
no
doubt
again
agreed
the
tutor
but
if
you
do
the
man
who
takes
my
place
may
not
know
how
to
make
bows
and
arrows
or
build
dams
or
anything
that
fun
while
he
may
not
be
so
patient
as
i
am
being
hungry
ai
fun
growled
malcolm
that
your
own
fault
tower
reminded
him
you
would
eat
that
was
a
good
breakfast
was
a
thing
lucette
gave
us
scoffed
james
but
you
do
like
lucette
very
well
said
tower
after
been
a
man
six
months
you
wo
eat
cake
for
breakfast
or
much
of
it
at
any
time
lucette
is
never
coming
back
marvelled
malcolm
never
said
tower
conclusively
how
soon
are
we
going
home
demanded
james
never
replied
tower
you
are
going
to
live
where
you
were
last
night
after
this
where
is
mamma
cried
malcolm
gone
for
the
summer
explained
tower
i
know
she
always
goes
said
james
but
she
took
us
before
i
just
hate
it
i
like
this
better
we
make
no
difference
to
her
anyway
let
her
go
ai
we
rich
boys
any
more
inquired
malcolm
i
do
know
said
tower
that
is
your
father
business
i
think
you
have
as
much
money
as
ever
but
from
now
on
you
are
going
to
live
like
men
we
wo
live
like
men
cried
both
boys
now
look
here
said
tower
kindly
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
a
big
boy
almost
ten
years
old
and
another
nearly
his
age
who
can
barely
read
who
ca
throw
straight
who
ca
swim
or
row
or
walk
a
mile
without
puffing
like
an
engine
who
begins
to
sweat
over
lifting
a
few
stones
is
a
mighty
poor
specimen
you
think
you
are
wonders
because
you
heard
yourself
called
big
fine
boys
you
are
soft
fatties
i
can
take
you
to
the
park
and
pick
out
any
number
of
boys
half
your
size
and
age
who
can
make
either
of
you
yell
for
mercy
in
three
seconds
you
are
boys
at
all
if
you
had
to
get
on
your
feet
and
hike
back
to
town
before
a
mile
you
be
lying
beside
the
road
bellowing
worse
than
i
heard
you
yet
you
are
as
tough
and
game
as
half
the
girls
of
your
age
i
know
you
shut
your
mouth
cried
james
in
rage
mother
fire
you
it
is
you
who
are
fired
young
man
said
the
tutor
your
mother
is
far
away
by
this
time
she
left
you
boys
with
your
father
who
pays
me
to
make
of
you
so
i
going
to
do
it
you
are
big
enough
to
know
that
you
never
be
men
motoring
around
with
nurses
like
small
babies
eating
cake
and
ice
cream
when
your
bones
and
muscles
are
in
need
of
stiffening
and
toughening
william
peel
off
your
shirt
and
show
these
chaps
how
a
man
muscle
should
be
william
obeyed
swelling
his
muscles
now
you
try
that
suggested
tower
to
james
and
see
how
much
muscle
you
can
raise
i
no
gutter
snipe
he
sneered
i
a
gentleman
i
do
need
muscle
i
never
going
to
work
but
you
just
been
working
cried
the
tutor
carrying
those
stones
was
work
and
you
remember
it
took
both
of
you
to
lift
one
that
william
who
is
only
a
little
older
than
you
james
moved
with
one
hand
you
ca
without
working
you
got
to
pull
to
row
a
boat
or
hold
a
horse
you
must
step
out
lively
to
play
tennis
or
golf
or
to
skate
while
if
you
try
to
swim
without
work
you
drown
i
ai
going
to
do
those
things
retorted
james
no
you
are
going
to
spend
your
life
riding
in
an
automobile
with
a
nurse
feeding
you
cake
scoffed
the
tutor
william
shouted
and
turned
a
cart
wheel
so
flashingly
quick
that
both
boys
jumped
james
face
coloured
a
slow
red
so
the
tutor
took
hope
i
see
that
makes
you
blush
he
said
no
wonder
you
should
be
as
tough
as
leather
and
spinning
along
this
creek
bank
like
william
instead
you
are
a
big
bloated
softy
you
carry
too
much
fat
for
your
size
while
you
are
mushy
as
pudding
if
i
were
you
i
show
my
father
how
much
of
a
man
i
could
be
instead
of
how
much
of
a
baby
father
is
a
gentleman
announced
malcolm
lucette
said
so
hush
cried
tower
do
you
ever
say
that
again
your
father
is
one
of
the
big
men
of
this
great
city
one
of
the
men
who
think
plan
and
make
things
happen
that
result
in
health
safety
and
comfort
for
all
of
us
one
of
the
men
who
is
going
to
rule
not
only
his
own
home
but
this
city
and
this
whole
state
one
of
these
days
you
your
father
you
do
know
what
men
say
and
think
of
him
you
do
know
that
lucette
was
fit
for
nothing
but
to
wash
and
dress
you
like
babies
big
boys
who
should
have
been
to
let
a
woman
wait
on
them
you
do
know
that
she
is
on
her
way
back
where
she
came
from
because
she
could
not
do
her
work
right
and
you
have
the
nerve
to
tell
me
what
she
said
about
a
fine
man
like
your
father
i
amazed
at
you
gentlemen
do
work
persisted
malcolm
mother
said
so
i
sorry
to
contradict
your
mother
but
she
forgot
something
said
tower
if
the
world
has
any
gentlemen
it
surely
should
be
those
born
for
generations
of
royal
and
titled
blood
and
reared
from
their
cradles
in
every
tradition
of
their
rank
europe
is
full
of
them
and
many
are
superb
men
i
know
a
few
now
will
you
tell
me
where
they
are
they
are
down
in
trenches
six
feet
under
ground
shivering
in
mud
and
water
half
dead
for
sleep
food
and
rest
trying
to
save
the
land
of
their
birth
the
homes
they
own
to
protect
the
women
and
children
they
love
they
are
marching
miles
being
shot
down
in
cavalry
rushes
and
blown
up
in
boats
they
are
manning
in
their
fight
to
save
their
countries
do
work
you
are
too
much
of
an
idiot
to
talk
with
if
you
do
know
how
gentlemen
of
birth
rank
and
by
nature
are
working
this
very
day
the
descent
on
him
was
precipitate
and
tumultuous
the
war
shouted
both
boys
in
chorus
tell
us
about
the
war
oh
i
just
love
the
war
cried
malcolm
when
i
a
man
i
going
to
have
a
big
shiny
sword
and
ride
and
fight
and
make
the
enemy
fly
you
ought
to
seen
gretchen
and
lucette
fight
they
ai
either
one
got
much
hair
left
the
tutor
could
not
help
laughing
but
he
made
room
for
a
boy
on
either
side
of
him
and
began
on
the
war
it
was
a
big
subject
there
were
phases
of
it
that
shocked
and
repulsed
him
but
it
was
his
task
to
undo
the
wrong
work
of
ten
years
he
was
forced
to
use
the
instrument
that
would
accomplish
that
end
with
so
much
material
he
could
tell
of
things
unavoidable
that
men
of
strength
and
courage
were
doing
not
forgetting
the
boys
and
the
william
stretched
at
his
feet
and
occasionally
made
a
suggestion
or
asked
a
question
while
james
and
malcolm
were
interested
in
something
at
last
when
it
was
time
to
return
neither
wanted
to
go
your
father
orders
were
to
come
for
him
at
eleven
reminded
tower
i
work
for
him
so
i
must
obey
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
father
cried
james
i
order
you
to
stay
here
and
tell
of
the
fighting
tell
about
the
french
boy
who
would
show
where
the
troops
were
oh
i
am
to
take
orders
from
you
am
i
queried
tower
all
right
pay
my
salary
and
give
me
the
money
to
buy
our
lunch
james
stood
thinking
a
second
i
have
all
the
money
i
want
he
said
i
go
to
ranger
for
my
money
mother
always
makes
her
give
me
what
i
ask
for
you
have
forgotten
that
you
have
moved
and
brought
only
yourselves
said
tower
your
mother
and
the
money
are
gone
your
father
pays
the
bills
now
and
if
you
watch
sharp
you
see
that
things
have
changed
since
this
time
yesterday
every
one
pays
all
the
attention
there
is
to
now
what
we
have
and
do
and
want
must
come
from
him
and
as
it
a
big
contract
and
he
needed
to
help
manage
this
city
we
better
begin
thinking
about
father
and
taking
care
of
him
as
much
as
we
can
now
we
are
to
obey
him
come
on
william
lunch
time
and
i
hungry
the
boys
climbed
into
the
car
without
a
word
and
before
it
had
gone
a
mile
malcolm
slipped
against
the
tutor
and
shortly
thereafter
james
slid
to
the
floor
tired
to
insensibility
and
sound
asleep
so
minturn
found
them
when
he
came
from
his
office
he
looked
them
over
carefully
wet
grimy
bruised
and
sleeping
in
exhaustion
poor
little
soldiers
he
said
your
battle
has
been
a
hard
one
i
see
i
hope
to
god
you
gained
a
victory
he
entered
the
car
picked
up
james
and
taking
him
in
his
arms
laid
the
tired
head
on
his
breast
leaning
his
face
against
the
boy
hair
when
the
car
stopped
at
the
new
house
the
tutor
waited
for
instructions
wake
them
up
make
them
wash
themselves
and
come
to
lunch
said
minturn
afterward
if
they
are
sleepy
let
them
nap
they
must
establish
regular
habits
at
the
beginning
it
the
only
way
dashes
of
cold
water
helped
so
william
and
the
tutor
telling
each
other
how
hungry
they
were
brought
two
boys
ready
to
eat
anything
to
the
table
cake
and
cream
were
not
mentioned
bread
and
milk
cold
meat
salad
and
a
plain
pudding
were
delicious
between
bites
james
studied
his
father
then
suddenly
burst
forth
are
you
a
gentleman
i
try
to
be
answered
minturn
are
you
running
this
city
put
in
malcolm
i
am
doing
what
i
can
to
help
said
his
father
make
johnston
take
me
home
to
get
my
money
you
have
no
home
but
this
said
minturn
your
old
home
now
belongs
to
the
city
of
multiopolis
it
is
to
be
torn
up
and
made
over
into
a
place
where
sick
children
can
be
cured
if
you
are
ever
too
ill
for
us
to
manage
we
take
you
there
to
be
doctored
will
mother
and
lucette
be
there
asked
james
malcolm
nudged
his
brother
ca
you
remember
he
said
lucette
has
gone
across
the
ocean
and
she
is
never
coming
back
goody
goody
and
you
know
about
how
much
mother
cares
when
we
are
sick
she
the
other
when
anybody
is
she
just
hates
sick
people
let
go
and
get
your
thus
reminded
james
began
again
i
want
to
get
my
money
your
money
came
from
your
mother
so
it
went
with
your
home
your
clothes
and
your
playthings
explained
minturn
you
have
none
until
you
some
i
can
give
you
a
home
education
and
a
fine
position
when
you
are
old
enough
to
hold
it
but
i
give
you
money
no
one
ever
gave
me
any
i
always
had
to
work
for
mine
from
now
on
you
are
going
to
live
with
me
so
if
you
have
money
you
have
to
go
to
work
and
earn
both
boys
looked
aghast
at
him
ai
we
rich
any
more
no
said
minturn
merely
comfortable
james
leaned
back
in
his
chair
twisting
his
body
in
its
smooth
linen
covering
he
looked
intently
at
the
room
table
and
people
surrounding
it
he
glanced
from
the
window
at
the
wide
green
lawn
the
big
trees
and
for
an
instant
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
birds
singing
there
he
laid
down
his
fork
turning
to
his
brother
then
he
exploded
the
bomb
that
shattered
the
family
oh
damn
being
rich
he
cried
i
like
being
a
better
malcolm
being
rich
has
put
us
about
ten
miles
behind
where
we
ought
to
be
we
softies
we
would
the
guns
and
told
where
the
soldiers
were
for
cake
brace
up
let
get
in
the
game
father
have
we
got
to
go
on
the
street
and
hunt
work
or
can
you
give
us
a
job
james
minturn
tried
to
speak
then
pushing
back
his
chair
left
the
table
precipitately
james
looked
after
him
doubtfully
he
turned
to
aunt
margaret
please
excuse
me
he
said
i
guess
he
choked
i
better
go
pound
him
on
the
back
like
lucette
does
us
malcolm
looked
at
aunt
margaret
mother
wo
let
us
work
he
announced
it
like
this
malcolm
said
aunt
margaret
gently
mother
had
charge
of
you
for
ten
years
the
women
she
employed
did
train
you
as
boys
should
be
so
mother
has
turned
you
over
to
father
for
the
next
ten
years
you
will
try
plan
after
that
you
will
be
big
enough
to
decide
how
you
want
to
live
but
now
i
think
you
will
just
love
father
way
if
you
will
behave
yourself
long
enough
to
find
out
what
fun
it
is
mother
wo
like
it
said
malcolm
positively
i
think
she
does
dear
or
she
would
have
gone
and
left
you
to
try
it
said
aunt
margaret
she
knew
what
your
father
would
think
you
should
do
if
she
had
thought
he
was
she
would
have
taken
you
with
her
as
before
i
just
hate
being
taken
on
trains
and
boats
with
her
so
does
james
we
like
the
dam
the
fish
and
we
going
to
have
bows
and
arrows
to
shoot
at
mark
and
we
are
going
to
swim
and
row
added
william
and
we
are
going
to
be
soldiers
and
hurl
back
the
enemy
boasted
malcolm
ai
we
mr
tower
indian
scouts
are
more
fun
suggested
the
tutor
and
there
is
the
money
we
must
earn
if
we
to
said
malcolm
i
guess
father
is
telling
james
how
i
go
ask
him
too
excuse
me
aunt
margaret
of
all
the
surprises
i
ever
did
have
this
is
the
biggest
one
said
aunt
margaret
i
was
afraid
i
never
could
like
them
i
thought
this
morning
it
would
take
years
there
is
nothing
like
the
receptivity
and
plasticity
of
children
said
the
tutor
later
james
minturn
appeared
on
his
veranda
with
a
small
boy
clinging
to
each
hand
the
trio
came
forth
with
red
eyes
but
firmly
allied
call
the
car
if
you
please
william
said
senior
i
am
going
to
help
build
that
dam
higher
and
see
how
many
fish
i
can
catch
for
my
pool
malcolm
walked
beside
him
rubbing
his
head
caressingly
across
an
arm
we
do
have
to
go
on
the
streets
and
hunt
he
announced
father
is
going
to
find
us
work
while
the
war
is
so
bad
we
drink
milk
and
send
what
we
earn
to
boys
who
have
no
father
the
war
wo
take
our
father
will
it
we
will
pray
god
not
to
let
that
happen
said
aunt
margaret
is
there
room
in
the
car
for
me
too
james
i
have
seen
one
of
those
little
brook
fish
in
years
james
went
to
her
and
leaned
against
her
chair
i
got
three
in
my
pool
you
may
see
mine
i
give
you
one
i
love
to
see
them
said
aunt
margaret
i
go
bring
my
hat
but
i
think
you
should
give
the
fish
away
james
they
belong
to
god
he
made
their
home
in
the
water
if
you
take
them
out
you
will
kill
them
and
he
wo
like
that
let
just
look
at
them
and
leave
them
in
the
water
malcolm
the
fish
to
god
said
james
turning
to
his
brother
we
may
play
with
them
but
we
must
take
them
out
of
the
water
and
hurt
them
well
who
going
to
take
them
out
of
the
water
cried
malcolm
just
going
to
scoot
one
over
into
father
pool
to
start
him
will
you
give
him
one
too
yes
said
james
the
next
money
i
earn
i
shall
send
to
the
war
but
the
first
time
i
rake
the
lawn
and
clean
the
rugs
i
give
what
i
earn
to
father
so
he
will
have
more
time
to
play
with
us
father
is
the
biggest
man
in
this
city
it
may
take
a
few
days
to
get
a
new
régime
started
said
father
i
lived
only
for
work
so
long
but
as
soon
as
it
possible
my
day
will
be
so
arranged
that
some
part
of
it
shall
be
yours
boys
to
show
me
what
you
are
doing
i
think
one
day
can
be
given
wholly
to
going
to
the
country
with
an
ecstatic
whoop
they
rushed
james
minturn
whose
wide
aching
arms
opened
to
them
chapter
x
wheel
of
what
are
your
plans
for
this
summer
leslie
asked
winton
over
his
paper
at
breakfast
the
real
question
is
what
are
yours
i
have
none
said
winton
i
ca
see
my
way
to
making
any
for
myself
between
us
strictly
swain
has
been
hard
hit
he
gave
me
my
chance
in
life
it
is
in
my
skin
to
pack
up
and
leave
for
the
or
the
mountains
on
the
results
of
what
he
helped
me
to
and
allow
him
to
put
up
his
fight
if
you
understood
you
be
ashamed
of
me
if
i
did
leslie
but
i
do
understand
daddy
cried
the
girl
what
makes
you
think
i
do
all
my
life
you
been
telling
me
how
you
love
swain
and
what
a
splendid
big
thing
he
did
for
you
when
you
were
young
is
the
war
making
business
awfully
hard
for
you
men
close
my
girl
said
winton
bed
rock
close
that
is
what
cramps
mr
swain
she
continued
it
is
what
cramps
all
of
us
said
winton
it
hit
him
with
peculiar
force
because
he
had
made
bad
investments
he
was
running
light
anyway
in
an
effort
to
recoup
all
of
us
are
on
a
tension
brought
about
by
the
result
of
political
changes
to
which
we
were
struggling
to
adjust
ourselves
when
the
war
began
working
greater
hardships
and
entailing
millions
of
loss
and
expenses
i
see
and
that
why
i
said
the
real
question
was
are
your
plans
explained
leslie
because
when
i
find
out
if
perchance
they
should
involve
staying
on
the
job
this
summer
why
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
on
the
job
too
i
thought
out
the
grandest
scheme
yes
leslie
tell
me
said
winton
it
like
this
said
leslie
everybody
is
economizing
shamelessly
and
that
a
bully
word
daddy
for
in
most
instances
it
is
shameless
open
faced
save
me
and
my
wife
and
my
son
john
and
his
wife
in
our
women
clubs
and
lectures
magazines
and
sermons
we
had
a
steady
dose
all
winter
of
hard
times
and
economy
and
tried
to
make
my
friends
see
that
their
efforts
at
economy
are
responsible
for
the
very
hardest
crux
of
the
hard
times
you
mean
leslie
suggested
winton
eagerly
i
mean
all
of
us
quit
using
eggs
dealers
become
frightened
eggs
soar
higher
economize
on
meat
packers
buy
less
meat
goes
up
all
of
us
discharge
our
help
army
of
unemployed
swells
by
millions
it
works
two
ways
and
every
friend
i
got
is
economizing
for
herself
and
with
every
stroke
for
herself
she
is
weakening
her
nation
financial
position
and
putting
a
bigger
burden
on
the
man
she
is
trying
to
help
well
leslie
cried
her
father
the
time
has
come
for
women
to
find
out
what
it
is
all
about
then
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
of
life
and
push
but
before
we
gain
enough
force
to
start
with
any
momentum
women
must
get
together
and
decide
what
they
want
what
they
are
pushing
for
have
you
decided
what
you
are
pushing
for
unalterably
cried
the
girl
and
what
is
it
asked
her
father
my
happiness
my
joy
in
life
she
exclaimed
and
exactly
in
what
do
you
feel
your
happiness
consists
leslie
he
asked
you
and
douglas
my
home
and
my
men
and
what
they
imply
she
answered
instantly
as
i
figure
it
it
that
count
daddy
if
the
nation
prospers
the
birth
rate
of
americans
has
got
to
keep
up
or
soon
the
immigrants
will
be
in
control
everywhere
as
they
are
in
places
right
now
births
imply
homes
homes
suggest
men
to
support
them
women
to
control
them
if
the
present
unrest
resolves
itself
into
a
personal
question
so
far
as
the
women
are
concerned
at
least
if
you
are
going
to
get
to
primal
things
whether
she
realizes
it
or
no
what
each
woman
really
she
learns
as
nellie
minturn
learned
when
she
took
her
naked
soul
into
the
swamp
and
showed
it
to
her
god
what
each
woman
is
her
man
her
cave
and
her
baby
if
the
world
is
to
prosper
is
woman
work
why
do
you
men
who
are
doing
big
things
it
and
do
yourselves
what
women
are
going
to
be
forced
from
home
to
mighty
soon
now
if
you
do
well
leslie
cried
winton
you
said
that
before
daddy
exclaimed
the
girl
yet
what
you
truly
want
of
a
woman
is
a
home
and
children
children
imply
to
all
men
what
i
am
to
you
if
some
men
have
not
reared
their
children
so
that
they
receive
from
them
what
you
get
from
me
it
is
time
for
the
men
to
this
and
change
their
methods
of
their
daughters
and
sons
a
home
should
mean
to
every
man
what
your
home
does
to
you
if
all
men
do
not
get
from
their
homes
what
you
do
in
most
cases
it
is
own
of
course
i
know
there
are
women
so
abominably
obsessed
with
self
they
refuse
to
become
mothers
and
prefer
a
café
with
tangoing
between
courses
to
a
home
such
women
should
have
first
the
ducking
stool
and
if
that
is
efficacious
extermination
they
are
a
disgrace
to
our
civilization
and
the
weakest
spot
we
have
they
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
present
boiling
discontent
of
women
who
really
want
to
be
home
loving
home
keeping
they
are
directly
responsible
for
the
fathers
sons
brothers
and
lovers
with
two
standards
of
morals
a
man
reared
in
the
right
kind
of
a
home
by
a
real
mother
who
goes
into
other
homes
of
the
same
kind
ruled
by
similar
mothers
when
he
leaves
his
and
marries
the
right
girl
and
establishes
for
himself
a
real
home
is
not
going
to
go
it
is
the
sons
lovers
and
husbands
of
the
women
who
refuse
home
and
children
and
carry
their
men
into
a
perpetual
round
of
what
they
deem
pleasure
in
their
youth
who
find
life
desolate
when
age
begins
to
come
and
who
instantly
rebel
strongest
against
the
very
conditions
they
have
made
i
been
listening
to
you
all
my
life
daddy
and
remembering
mother
reading
thinking
and
watching
for
what
really
pays
and
believe
me
found
i
gave
nellie
minturn
the
best
in
my
heart
the
other
day
but
you
should
see
what
i
got
back
horrors
daddy
just
plain
horrors
i
said
to
douglas
that
night
when
i
read
him
the
letter
i
afterward
showed
you
that
if
as
she
suggested
i
was
faintly
tempted
to
neglect
home
life
for
society
in
her
i
would
have
all
the
example
i
ever
need
and
rest
assured
i
shall
poor
woman
exclaimed
winton
exactly
cried
leslie
and
the
poorest
thing
about
it
is
that
is
not
to
in
the
least
you
and
my
mother
could
have
made
the
same
kind
of
a
woman
of
me
if
you
had
fed
me
cake
instead
of
bread
if
you
had
given
me
candy
instead
of
fruit
if
you
had
taken
me
to
the
show
instead
of
entertaining
me
at
home
if
you
had
sent
me
to
summer
resorts
instead
of
summering
with
me
in
the
country
you
have
had
another
nellie
on
your
hands
the
world
is
full
of
nellies
but
where
one
woman
flees
too
strict
and
monotonous
a
home
to
make
a
nellie
out
of
herself
ten
are
taken
out
and
deliberately
moulded
drilled
and
fashioned
into
nellies
by
their
own
parents
i
have
lain
awake
at
nights
figuring
this
daddy
some
woman
is
urging
me
every
day
to
join
different
movements
and
i
been
forced
to
study
this
out
i
know
the
cause
of
the
present
unrest
among
women
and
it
is
suggested
winton
it
is
the
rebound
from
the
pioneer
lives
of
our
grandmothers
they
and
their
mothers
were
at
one
extreme
we
are
at
the
widest
sweep
of
the
other
they
were
forced
to
enter
the
forest
and
in
most
cases
defend
themselves
from
savages
and
animals
to
work
without
tools
to
live
with
few
comforts
in
their
determination
to
save
their
children
from
hardships
they
lost
sense
ballast
and
reason
they
have
saved
them
to
such
an
extent
they
have
them
by
the
very
method
of
their
rearing
they
have
robbed
their
children
of
love
for
and
interest
in
home
life
and
with
their
own
hands
sent
them
to
cafés
and
dance
halls
when
they
should
be
at
their
homes
training
their
children
for
the
fashioning
of
future
homes
i
tell
you
daddy
leslie
tell
me
this
interposed
winton
did
you
get
any
small
part
of
what
you
have
been
saying
to
me
from
me
do
you
feel
what
i
have
tried
to
teach
you
and
the
manner
in
which
i
have
tried
to
rear
you
have
put
your
love
for
me
into
your
heart
and
such
ideas
as
you
are
propounding
into
your
head
of
course
daddy
cried
the
girl
who
else
mother
was
dear
and
wonderful
but
i
scarcely
remember
her
what
you
put
into
the
growth
of
me
that
is
what
is
bound
to
come
out
when
i
begin
to
live
independently
this
is
the
best
moment
of
my
life
said
winton
from
your
birth
you
have
been
the
better
part
of
me
to
me
and
with
all
my
heart
i
have
to
fashion
you
into
such
a
woman
for
a
future
home
as
your
mother
began
and
you
have
completed
for
me
other
things
have
failed
me
i
count
you
my
success
leslie
oh
daddy
cried
the
happy
girl
now
go
back
to
our
start
said
winton
you
have
plans
for
the
summer
of
course
i
realized
that
at
the
beginning
are
you
ready
to
tell
me
i
am
ready
to
ask
you
she
said
thank
you
said
winton
i
appreciate
the
difference
surely
a
man
does
enjoy
counting
for
something
with
his
women
spoiled
shamelessly
dearest
that
what
you
are
said
leslie
a
spoiled
pampered
father
but
to
conclude
swain
helped
you
pay
back
daddy
no
matter
what
the
cost
pay
you
help
help
my
idea
was
this
for
weeks
i
foreseen
that
you
like
to
leave
business
this
summer
douglas
is
delving
into
that
investigation
minturn
started
him
on
and
he
could
be
dragged
away
he
perfectly
possessed
of
course
where
my
men
are
like
ruth
will
be
i
also
so
for
days
i
been
working
on
a
plan
and
now
it
all
finished
and
waiting
your
veto
or
approval
thrilling
leslie
tell
quickly
i
all
agog
it
this
let
not
go
away
and
spend
big
sums
on
travel
dress
and
close
the
house
and
throw
our
people
out
of
work
do
you
realize
daddy
how
long
you
had
the
same
housekeeper
cook
maid
and
driver
do
you
know
how
badly
i
feel
to
let
them
go
and
risk
getting
them
back
in
the
fall
my
scheme
is
to
rent
for
practically
nothing
a
log
cabin
i
know
a
little
over
an
hour
run
from
here
a
log
cabin
with
four
rooms
and
a
and
a
log
stable
beside
a
lake
where
there
is
grand
fishing
and
swimming
but
leslie
protested
winton
now
listen
cried
the
girl
the
rent
is
nominal
we
get
the
house
stable
orchard
garden
a
few
acres
and
a
rented
cow
the
cabin
has
two
tiny
rooms
above
one
for
you
the
other
for
douglas
below
it
has
a
room
for
me
a
and
a
kitchen
the
big
log
barn
close
beside
has
space
in
the
for
the
women
and
in
one
side
below
for
our
driver
the
other
for
the
cars
over
the
cabin
is
a
grapevine
around
it
there
are
fruit
trees
there
is
a
large
rich
garden
if
i
had
your
permission
i
could
begin
putting
in
vegetables
tomorrow
that
would
make
our
summer
supply
rogers
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
rogers
would
touch
a
garden
queried
winton
i
am
going
to
tell
you
that
rogers
has
been
with
me
in
every
step
of
my
investigations
replied
leslie
yesterday
i
called
in
my
household
and
gave
them
a
lecture
on
the
present
crisis
i
found
them
a
remarkably
audience
they
had
a
very
distinct
idea
that
if
i
economized
by
dismissing
them
for
the
summer
and
leaving
the
house
with
a
caretaker
what
it
would
mean
to
then
i
took
my
helpers
into
the
car
and
drove
out
the
atwater
road
you
know
it
well
daddy
the
road
that
runs
smooth
over
miles
of
country
and
then
instead
of
jumping
into
a
lake
as
it
seems
to
be
going
to
it
swings
into
corduroy
through
a
marsh
runs
up
on
a
little
bridge
spanning
the
channel
between
two
lakes
lifts
to
atwater
lake
shore
than
which
none
is
more
lovely
you
remember
the
white
sand
floor
and
the
clean
water
for
swimming
climbs
another
hill
and
opposite
beautiful
wood
there
stands
the
log
cabin
i
told
you
of
there
i
took
them
and
explained
they
could
clean
up
in
a
day
rogers
could
plant
the
garden
and
take
enough
on
one
truck
load
for
a
beginning
we
may
have
wood
for
the
fireplace
by
gathering
it
from
the
forest
floor
rogers
again
are
you
quite
about
rogers
suppose
you
ride
with
him
going
down
and
ask
him
yourself
suggested
leslie
rogers
is
anxious
to
hold
his
place
you
see
it
like
this
all
of
them
get
regular
wages
have
a
chance
at
the
swimming
rowing
gardening
and
the
country
the
saving
comes
in
on
living
expenses
out
there
we
have
the
cow
flour
fish
and
poultry
from
the
neighbours
fresh
eggs
butter
and
the
garden

serve
cooking
fuel
gasoline
daddy
will
you
go
and
see
no
i
wo
go
and
see
i
go
swim
and
fish
said
winton
great
heavens
leslie
do
you
really
mean
to
live
all
beside
a
lake
where
a
man
can
expand
absorb
and
exercise
i
must
get
out
my
fishing
tackle
i
wonder
what
douglas
has
i
tried
that
lake
when
bass
were
slashing
around
wild
thorn
and
crab
trees
shedding
petals
and
bugs
it
is
man
sport
there
i
like
black
bass
fishing
i
remember
that
water
fine
for
swimming
not
the
exhilaration
of
salt
perhaps
but
grand
clean
old
northern
indiana
water
cooled
by
springs
i
love
it
lord
leslie
why
do
we
that
place
why
have
we
homed
there
and
been
comfortable
for
years
i
shall
go
ahead
then
queried
leslie
you
shall
go
miss
hurry
cried
winton
i
give
you
just
two
days
one
to
clean
the
other
to
move
night
send
for
me
i
want
a
swim
and
cornbread
milk
and
three
rashers
of
bacon
for
my
dinner
and
nothing
else
and
ca
the
maids
have
my
room
and
let
me
have
a
blanket
on
the
hay
but
father
the
garden
cautioned
leslie
oh
drat
the
garden
cried
winton
but
if
you
go
dratting
things
i
ca
economize
the
girl
reminded
him
rogers
and
i
have
that
garden
down
on
paper
and
it
now
leslie
do
the
golf
links
lie
half
a
mile
from
there
closer
daddy
said
the
girl
right
around
the
corner
i
do
see
why
you
did
think
of
it
before
he
said
have
you
told
douglas
not
a
word
exclaimed
leslie
i
going
to
invite
him
out
when
everything
is
in
fine
order
do
make
things
fine
said
winton
let
have
them
rough
they
will
be
rough
enough
to
suit
you
daddy
laughed
leslie
but
a
few
things
have
got
to
be
done
then
hurry
but
do
forget
the
snake
question
people
are
and
have
been
living
there
for
generations
common
care
is
all
that
is
required
said
leslie
i
be
careful
but
if
you
tell
bruce
until
i
am
ready
i
never
forgive
you
winton
arose
to
me
arms
he
laughed
spreading
them
wide
i
wonder
if
douglas
bruce
knows
what
a
treasure
he
is
going
to
possess
certainly
not
said
leslie
emphatically
i
would
have
him
know
for
the
world
i
am
going
to
be
his
progressive
housekeeping
party
to
which
he
is
invited
every
day
after
we
are
married
and
each
day
he
has
got
a
new
surprise
coming
that
i
hope
he
will
like
the
woman
who
endures
and
wears
well
in
matrimony
is
the
one
who
something
to
herself
it
my
opinion
that
modern
marriage
would
be
more
satisfactory
if
the
engaged
parties
would
not
come
so
nearly
being
married
for
so
long
before
they
are
there
is
so
little
left
for
afterward
in
most
cases
that
it
soon
grows
monotonous
leslie
where
did
you
get
all
of
this
he
asked
i
told
you
from
you
mostly
explained
the
girl
and
from
watching
my
friends
go
on
daddy
and
send
rogers
back
soon
i
want
to
begin
buying
radish
seed
and
onion
sets
so
leslie
telephoned
douglas
bruce
that
she
would
be
very
busy
with
housekeeping
affairs
the
coming
two
days
she
made
a
list
of
what
would
be
required
for
that
day
left
the
maids
to
collect
it
and
went
to
buy
seeds
and
a
few
tools
then
returning
she
divided
her
forces
and
leaving
part
to
pack
the
bedding
old
dishes
and
things
absolutely
required
for
living
she
took
the
loaded
car
and
drove
to
atwater
lake
the
owner
of
the
land
a
cultured
refined
gentleman
who
spoke
the
same
brand
of
english
used
by
the
wintons
and
evinced
a
knowledge
of
the
same
books
was
genuinely
interested
in
leslie
and
her
plans
it
was
a
land
owner
busiest
season
but
he
spared
a
man
an
hour
with
a
plow
to
turn
up
the
garden
and
came
down
himself
and
with
practiced
hand
swung
the
scythe
and
made
sure
about
the
snakes
soon
the
maids
had
the
cabin
walls
swept
the
floors
scrubbed
the
windows
washed
and
that
was
all
that
could
be
done
the
seeds
were
earth
enfolded
in
warm
black
beds
with
flower
seeds
tucked
in
for
borders
the
cut
grass
was
raked
back
and
spread
to
dry
for
the
rented
cow
when
nothing
further
was
to
be
accomplished
there
they
returned
to
multiopolis
to
hasten
preparations
for
the
coming
day
it
was
all
so
good
leslie
stopped
at
her
father
office
and
poured
a
flood
of
cloverbloom
bird
notes
and
water
shimmer
into
his
willing
ears
she
seldom
went
to
douglas
bruce
offices
but
she
ran
up
a
few
moments
to
try
in
person
to
ease
what
she
felt
would
be
disappointment
in
not
spending
the
evening
with
her
the
day
would
be
full
far
into
the
night
with
affairs
at
home
he
would
notice
the
closing
of
the
house
and
she
could
not
risk
him
spoiling
her
plans
by
finding
out
what
they
were
before
she
was
ready
she
found
him
surrounded
with
huge
ledgers
delving
and
already
fretting
for
mickey
she
stood
laughing
in
his
doorway
half
piqued
to
find
him
so
absorbed
in
his
work
and
so
full
of
the
boy
he
was
missing
that
he
seemed
to
take
her
news
that
she
was
too
busy
to
see
him
that
night
with
quite
too
bearable
calmness
but
his
earnestness
about
coming
the
following
night
worked
his
pardon
so
leslie
left
laughing
to
herself
over
the
surprise
in
store
for
him
bruce
bent
over
his
work
praying
for
mickey
everything
went
wrong
without
him
he
was
enough
irritated
by
the
boy
who
was
not
mickey
that
when
the
boy
who
was
mickey
came
to
his
door
he
was
delighted
to
see
him
he
wanted
to
say
hello
little
friend
come
get
in
the
game
quickly
but
two
considerations
withheld
him
mickey
manners
were
a
trifle
too
casual
at
times
they
irritated
douglas
and
if
he
took
the
boy
into
his
life
as
he
hoped
to
he
would
come
into
constant
contact
with
leslie
and
her
friends
who
were
cultured
people
of
homing
instincts
mickey
manners
must
be
polished
and
the
way
to
do
it
was
not
to
drop
to
his
level
but
to
improve
mickey
and
again
the
day
before
he
had
told
mickey
to
sit
down
and
wait
until
an
order
was
given
him
to
invite
him
to
get
in
the
game
now
was
good
alliteration
it
pleased
the
formal
scotch
ear
as
did
many
another
united
states
phrase
of
the
street
so
musical
concise
and
packed
with
meaning
as
to
become
almost
classic
but
in
his
heart
he
meant
as
mickey
had
suspected
to
do
him
good
so
he
must
lay
his
foundations
with
care
what
he
said
was
a
cordial
and
cheerful
good
morning
noon
corrected
mickey
right
ye
are
good
it
is
what
my
job
me
i
wo
ask
that
again
plenty
douglas
admitted
but
first
any
luck
with
the
paper
route
all
over
but
killing
the
boy
i
sold
it
to
if
he
does
do
right
i
ai
perfectly
crazy
about
him
he
a
papa
boy
and
pretty
soft
but
maybe
he
learn
it
was
a
fine
chance
for
me
so
i
soaked
it
to
whom
did
you
sell
mickey
asked
douglas
to
your
driver
for
his
boy
answered
mickey
we
talked
it
over
last
night
say
was
your
driver
same
continued
or
did
you
detect
glimmerings
of
beefsteak
and
blood
in
him
this
morning
why
asked
douglas
curiously
oh
he
such
a
stiff
explained
mickey
he
looks
about
as
lively
as
a
salted
herring
and
did
you
make
an
effort
to
enliven
him
mickey
sure
cried
mickey
the
operation
was
highly
successful
the
patient
made
a
fine
recovery
right
on
the
job
right
on
the
street
right
at
the
thickest
traffic
corner
right
at
man
crossing
he
let
out
a
whoop
that
split
the
features
of
a
copper
who
had
smiled
in
years
it
was
a
double
play
and
it
worked
fine
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
it
was
fleeting
or
holds
over
it
must
be
mickey
said
douglas
since
you
mention
it
he
opened
the
door
with
the
information
that
it
was
a
fine
morning
while
i
recall
that
there
was
colour
on
his
face
and
light
in
his
usually
dull
eyes
good
cried
mickey
then
there
some
hope
that
his
kid
may
go
and
do
likewise
the
boy
who
takes
your
route
has
to
smile
mickey
well
you
see
most
of
my
morning
customers
are
regulars
so
they
are
used
to
it
said
mickey
the
minute
one
goes
into
his
paper
lost
knocking
off
time
but
if
he
starts
on
a
smile
he
a
chance
of
reproducing
it
before
the
day
is
over
leastwise
he
has
chance
than
if
he
never
smiles
so
it
is
a
part
of
the
contract
that
the
boy
smiles
at
his
work
questioned
douglas
is
so
exclaimed
mickey
i
asked
chaffner
at
the
office
what
was
a
fair
price
for
my
route
you
see
i
sold
the
from
the
word
go
and
we
pretty
thick
so
he
told
me
what
he
thought
it
lifted
my
lid
but
when
i
communicated
it
to
henry
casual
like
he
never
batted
an
eye
so
i
am
going
to
try
his
boy
i
satisfied
if
he
can
swing
the
job
it
a
go
your
customers
should
give
you
a
vote
of
thanks
and
so
they
will
cried
mickey
you
see
the
men
who
buy
of
me
are
the
top
crust
of
multiopolis
the
big
fine
men
who
can
smile
and
open
their
heads
and
say
a
pleasant
word
and
they
like
to
it
does
them
good
i
live
on
it
i
always
get
my
papers
close
home
as
i
can
so
i
have
time
coming
down
on
the
cars
to
take
a
peep
myself
and
nearly
always
there
are
at
least
three
things
on
the
first
page
that
hit
you
in
the
eye
once
long
ago
i
was
in
the
office
with
a
note
to
chaffner
the
big
chief
and
i
gave
him
a
little
word
jostle
as
i
passed
it
over
he
looked
at
me
and
laughed
good
natured
like
so
i
handed
him
this
you
the
big
stiff
that
bosses
the
he
says
i
can
control
it
if
i
want
to
right
for
you
i
said
live
by
selling
your
papers
but
i
could
sell
a
heap
more
if
i
had
a
better
chance
in
what
way
said
he
your
first
page
said
i
he
said
what
is
it
that
you
want
show
you
said
i
give
you
the
call
i
used
this
morning
then
i
cut
loose
and
just
like
on
the
street
i
cried
it
and
he
yelled
some
himself
more
do
you
want
he
asked
me
lot
i
said
see
i
only
got
a
little
time
on
the
cars
before
my
men
begin
to
get
on
and
my
time
is
precious
i
ca
read
second
third
and
pages
hunting
up
i
must
get
them
page
short
time
and
got
my
pack
to
hang
on
to
now
if
that
germans
driven
from
the
last
foot
of
belgian
soil
first
it
would
better
that
what
every
living
soul
wants
then
the
biggest
thing
about
place
it
prominent
in
big
black
letters
where
i
get
it
quick
and
easy
and
then
put
me
in
a
scream
get
me
a
laugh
in
my
call
and
i
sell
you
out
all
by
myself
folks
are
spending
millions
per
annum
for
the
glad
scream
at
night
they
pay
just
the
same
morning
give
them
a
chance
i
live
on
a
laugh
said
i
to
chaffner
he
looked
me
over
and
he
said
you
get
too
big
for
the
papers
you
come
to
me
and
i
make
a
reporter
out
of
you
boss
said
i
could
graft
that
job
on
to
me
with
asphaltum
and
a
buzz
saw
i
going
to
be
on
your
front
page
you
know
it
but
it
going
to
be
a
poetry
piece
that
will
raise
your
hair
i
ai
going
to
frost
my
cake
poking
into
folks
private
business
telling
shameful
things
on
them
that
half
kills
them
lots
of
times
i
see
them
getting
their
dose
on
the
cars
and
they
just
shiver
and
go
white
and
shake
nix
on
the
printing
about
shame
and
sin
and
trouble
in
the
papers
for
me
i
said
and
he
just
laughed
and
looked
at
me
closer
and
he
said
right
bring
your
poetry
yourself
and
if
they
do
let
you
in
give
them
this
and
he
wrote
a
line
i
got
at
home
yet
is
that
all
about
chaffner
asked
douglas
oh
no
said
mickey
he
said
here
is
a
batch
of
items
being
written
up
for
first
page
according
to
you
i
should
give
belgian
citizens
flocking
back
to
search
for
devastated
homes
the
first
place
got
the
first
place
in
the
heart
of
every
man
in
god
world
giving
it
first
place
is
putting
it
where
it
belongs
the
rest
of
it
said
he
do
you
want
next
the
same
glance
i
always
take
said
i
pointing
to
where
it
said
on
foot
to
eliminate
graft
from
city
offices
think
that
comes
next
said
he
said
i
the
pocketbook
sure
heart
first
money
next
you
so
sure
it
is
exactly
the
reverse
asked
he
it
said
i
the
crowds
any
day
and
every
clip
you
see
that
loving
a
man
country
and
his
home
and
his
kids
and
getting
fair
play
comes
money
i
guess
it
does
he
said
thoughtful
like
it
we
make
it
the
policy
of
this
paper
to
put
it
that
way
anyhow
what
next
your
laugh
said
i
while
you
are
at
it
make
it
a
scream
right
he
said
have
anything
funny
in
yet
but
i
get
it
now
show
me
where
you
want
these
spaced
so
i
showed
him
and
every
single
time
you
look
you
see
is
made
up
that
way
and
you
ought
to
hear
me
trolling
out
that
belgian
line
soft
and
easy
snapping
in
the
graft
quicklike
and
then
yelling
out
the
scream
you
bet
it
catches
them
if
i
ca
get
that
kid
on
to
his
job
have
to
take
it
back
myself
least
if
he
ca
get
on
he
doomed
to
get
off
i
gave
him
a
three
days
try
and
if
he
does
catch
by
that
time
he
never
will
but
how
are
you
going
to
know
asked
douglas
i
going
down
early
and
follow
him
and
drill
him
like
a
dutch
recruit
and
he
wake
up
my
men
and
interest
them
and
fetch
the
laugh
or
he
stop
you
think
you
got
a
fair
price
asked
douglas
know
it
all
it
worth
and
it
looks
like
a
margin
to
me
said
mickey
that
all
right
then
and
thank
you
for
telling
me
about
the
papers
said
douglas
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
i
see
you
are
a
keen
student
of
human
nature
all
the
studying
i
get
a
chance
at
said
mickey
you
have
opportunity
at
other
things
now
said
douglas
since
you
mention
it
i
see
your
point
about
the
papers
and
if
that
works
on
business
men
going
to
business
it
should
work
on
a
i
think
i
had
it
in
mind
that
i
was
to
be
a
compendium
of
information
and
impress
on
a
judge
or
jury
what
i
know
and
why
what
i
say
is
you
give
me
the
idea
that
a
better
way
would
be
to
impress
on
them
what

my
living
selling

papers
for
this
long
not

big
boys
and
more
each
man
is
different
but
you
can
cod
him
or
bluff
him
or
scare
him
or
let
down
the
floodgates
some
way
you
can
put
it
over
if
you
take
each
one
separate
and
hit
him
where
he
lives
see
finding
his
dwelling
place

douglas
what
you

be
invaluable
to
me
you

personal
ways
of
thinking
and
the
men

these
books
and

said
douglas
i
spent
one
of
the
most
profitable
hours
of
my
life
but
concretely
it
is
an
hour
and
going
to
the
country
club
and
may
stay
as
long
as
we
choose
and
we
going
to
have
a
grand
time
you
like
going
to
the
country
do
you
ai
words
for
telling
said
mickey
gathering
his
armload
of
books
and
racing
down
the
hall
when
the
day
work
was
finished
with
a
load
of
books
to
deliver
before
an
office
closed
they
started
on
the
run
to
the
club
house
bruce
waited
in
the
car
while
mickey
sped
in
with
the
books
and
returning
to
save
opening
the
door
and
crossing
before
the
man
he
was
fast
beginning
to
idolize
mickey
took
one
of
his
swift
cuts
across
the
back
end
of
the
car
while
his
hand
was
outstretched
and
his
foot
uplifted
to
enter
from
a
passing
truck
toppled
a
box
not
a
big
box
but
large
enough
to
knock
mickey
senseless
and
breathless
when
it
struck
him
between
the
shoulders
douglas
had
mickey
in
the
car
with
orders
for
the
nearest
hospital
toward
which
they
were
hurrying
when
the
boy
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
he
looked
inquiringly
at
douglas
across
whose
knees
he
had
found
himself
wha
what
happened
he
questioned
with
his
first
good
indrawing
of
recovered
breath
a
box
fell
from
a
truck
loaded
past
reason
and
almost
knocked
the
life
out
of
you
cried
douglas
the
life
out
of
me
repeated
mickey
you
been
senseless
for
three
blocks
mickey
a
slow
horror
spread
over
mickey
face
wha
what
was
you
going
to
do
he
wavered
running
for
a
hospital
said
douglas
my
head
had
been
busted
and
i
been
stretched
on
the
glass
table
and
maybe
laid
up
for
days
or
knocked
out
altogether
demanded
mickey
you
have
had
the
best
surgeon
in
multiopolis
and
every
care
mickey
assured
douglas
ugh
mickey
collapsed
utterly
must
be
hurt
worse
than
i
thought
was
douglas
mental
comment
he
could
be
a
coward
but
mickey
almost
proved
that
very
thing
by
regaining
his
senses
again
and
immediately
falling
into
spasms
of
shuddering
sobbing
douglas
held
him
carefully
every
moment
becoming
firmer
in
his
conviction
of
one
of
two
things
either
he
was
hurt
worse
or
he
was
he
would
not
let
himself
think
it
but
never
did
boy
appear
to
less
advantage
douglas
urged
the
driver
to
speed
mickey
heard
and
understood
never
mind
he
sobbed
i
all
right
bruce
i
ai
hurt
not
much
i
be
all
right
in
a
minute
if
you
not
hurt
what
the
matter
with
you
a
minute
gasped
mickey
as
another
spasm
of
sobbing
caught
him
i
am
amazed
cried
douglas
a
little
jolt
like
that
you
are
acting
like
a
coward
mickey
the
word
straightened
mickey
coward
who
me
he
cried
me
that
made
my
way
since
i
can
remember
coward
did
you
say
of
course
not
mickey
cried
douglas
excuse
me
i
should
have
said
that
but
it
is
unlike
you
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
i
helped
carry
in
a
busted
head
and
saw
the
glass
table
once
he
cried
inch
more
and
it
would
my
head
and
i
might
have
been
knocked
out
for
days
o
lord
what
will
i
mickey
you
not
afraid
asked
douglas
me
as
good
as
coward
what
is
the
matter
with
you
demanded
douglas
mickey
stared
at
him
amazedly
o
lord

panted

i
was
thinking
about
do
you
i

know
what
to
think
exclaimed
douglas
sure
how
could
you
conceded
mickey
he
choked
back
another
big
dry
sob
gim
me
a
minute
to
think
he
said
o
god
what
have
i
been
doing
i
see
now

against

said
douglas
bruce
suddenly
filled
with
compassion

of

more
than

winton

douglas

to
the
nurse
lady
she
used
to
folks
in
trouble
she

why

mickey
questioned
douglas

back

back
cried
mickey
roughly
i
hurt
honest
i
ai
douglas
took
a
long
penetrating
look
at
the
small
shaking
figure
then
he
said
softly
i
wish
you
wanted
to
confide
in
me
mickey
i
tell
you
how
glad
i
be
if
you

one
else

it
you
want
to
be
driven
there
ai
any
one
i
better
than
you
he
caught
a
name
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
paused
you
see
it
like
this
i
been
to
this
nurse
lady
before
and
i
know
exactly
what
she
say
and
think
if
you
do
think

and
if

and
take
gracious
heaven
mickey

do
think
i

demanded
douglas

mickey
i
only

said
douglas
when
i
do

what
you

thinking
about

i
give
considerable
if

i

you
about

cried
mickey
this
is
about
some
one
else
asked
douglas
casually
mickey
leaned
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
head
bent
with
intense
thinking
much
as
you
are
doing
for
me
he
muttered
if
you
really
care
if
it
makes
a
difference
to
you
of
course
i
can
you
if
you
think
as
i
do

cried
douglas
bruce
now
mickey

of

too
shaken
to

the
country

home
with
you
and

we

mickey

he
said
though
you
would
want
to
come
more
than
once
that
ai
what
i
was
thinking
about
think
all
you
like
mickey
said
douglas
henry
drive
to
the
end
of
the
car
line
where
you
gone
before
on
the
way
he
stopped
at
a
grocery
then
a
café
and
at
each
place
piles
of
tempting
packages
were
placed
in
the
car
mickey
brain
was
working
fast
one
big
fact
was
beginning
to
lift
above
all
the
others
his
treasure
was
slipping
from
him
and
for
her
safety
it
had
to
be
so
if
he
had
been
struck
on
the
head
forced
to
undergo
an
operation
and
had
lain
insensible
for
hours
mickey
could
go
no
further
with
that
thought
he
had
to
stop
and
proceed
with
the
other
part
of
his
problem
of
course
she
was
better
off
with
him
than
where
she
had
been
no
sane
person
could
dispute
that
she
was
happy
and
looking
improved
each
day
but
could
she
be
made
happier
and
cared
for
still
better
by
some
one
else
and
cured
without
the
long
wait
for
him
to
earn
the
money
if
she
could
what
would
be
the
right
name
for
him
if
he
kept
her
on
what
he
could
do
so
they
came
at
last
as
near
as
the
car
could
go
to
home
in
sunrise
alley
at
the
foot
of
the
last
flight
mickey
paused
package
laden
now
i
have
to
ask
you
to
wait
a
minute
he
said
he
ascended
unlocked
the
door
and
stepped
inside
peaches
eyes
gleamed
with
interest
at
the
packages
but
she
waved
him
back
as
mickey
closed
the
door
she
cried
my
piece
say
it
mickey
you
have
to
wait
again
said
mickey
i
got
hit
in
the
back
with
a
box
and
it
knocked
the
poetry
out
of
me
you
have
to
wait
after
supper
and
then
i
fix
the
grandest
one
yet
will
that
do
yes

hit
hard
mickey
conceded
peaches
it
hit
so
blame
hard
miss
chicken
that
it
knocked
me
down
and
knocked
me
out
and
bruce
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
three
blocks
in
his
car
before
i
got
my
wind
or
knew
what
ailed
me
peaches
face
was
tragic
her
hands
stretched
toward
him
mickey
was
young
and
his
brain
was
whirling
so
it
whirled
off
the
thought
that
came
first
and
if
it
had
hit
me
enough
to
bust
my
head
and
i
been
carried

mickey
brutal
with
emotion
if

her
mouth
and
stared
while
it
was
closed
at

ventured
a
solution

impatient

and

douglas
bruce
climbed
the
stairs
and
entered
the
door
as
mickey
expected
his
gaze
centred
and
stopped
mickey
began
taking
packages
from

gazing
douglas
yielded
them
then
he
stepped
forward
when

and
said
douglas

peaches
clung
to
mickey
and
past
him
peered
at
her
visitor
and
the
visitor
smiled
his
most
winning
smile
he
recognized
leslie
ribbon
and
noted
the
wondrous
beauty
of
the
small
white
face

slowly
flushing
the
faintest
pink
with
excitement
still
clinging
she
smiled
back
wordless
douglas
reached
over
to
pick
up
the
doll

the
right
thought

asked
peaches

mickey
dropping
back
against
her
pillows
her
smile

dazzling
jus
as
she
said

said
douglas
straightening
the
long
dress
an
that
my
slate

lesson

peaches
fine
he
said
again
as
if
it
were

only

at
him
grinning
sympathetically

mickey
pushed
up
the
table
then
began
opening
packages
and
setting
forth
their
contents
watching
him
as
he
moved
swiftly
and
with
assurance
his
head
high
his
lips
even
a
slow
deep
respect
for
the
big
soul
in
the
little
body
began
to
dawn
in
the
heart
of
douglas
bruce
understanding
of
mickey
came
in
rivers
swift
and
strong
so
while
he
wondered
and
while
he
watched
entranced
over
and
over
in
his
head
went
the
line
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
with
every
gentle
act
of
mickey
for
the
child
douglas
liking
for
him
grew
when
he
went
over
the
supper
and
with
the
judgment
of
a
nurse
selected
the
most
delicate
and
suitable
food
for
her
in
the
heart
of
the
scotsman
swelled
the
marvel
and
the
miracle
that
silenced
criticism
chapter
xi
advent
of
nancy
and
when
leslie
began
the
actual
work
of
closing
her
home
and
loading
what
would
be
wanted
for
the
country
she
found
the
task
too
big
for
the
time
allotted
so
wisely
telephoned
douglas
that
she
would
be
compelled
to
postpone
seeing
him
until
the
following
day
leslie
laughed
douglas
over
the
telephone
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
man
who
cut
off
his
dog
tail
an
inch
at
a
time
so
it
would
hurt
so
badly
i
have
heard
of
that
particular
dog
well
this
process
of
cutting
me
out
of
seeing
you
a
day
at
a
time
reminds
me
of
particular
dog
and
evokes
my
sympathy
for
the
canine
as
never
before
it
a
surprise
i
am
getting
ready
for
you
douglas
it
a
surprise
all
right
answered
douglas
and
of
morning
i
have
got
a
surprise
for
you
too
oh
goody
cried
leslie
i
adore
surprises
you
adore
this
one
you
might
give
me
a
hint
she
suggested
very
well
he
laughed
since
last
i
saw
you
i
have
seen
the
loveliest
girl
of
my
experience
delightful
am
i
to
see
her
also
undoubtedly
explained
douglas
and
you
succumb
to
her
charms
just
as
i
did
when
may
i
meet
her
asked
leslie
eagerly
i
ca
say
but
soon
now
all
right
agreed
the
girl
be
ready
at
four
tomorrow
leslie
sat
in
frowning
thought
a
moment
before
the
telephone
then
her
laugh
bubbled
why
did
i
think
of
it
while
i
was
talking
she
wondered
of
course
mickey
has
taken
him
to
visit
his
lily
i
must
see
about
that
wrong
back
before
bone
and
muscle
harden
then
she
began
her
task
by
evening
she
had
a
gasoline
stove
set
up
the
kitchen
provisioned
her
father
room
ready
and
arrangements
sufficiently
completed
that
she
sent
the
car
to
bring
him
to
his
dinner
of
cornbread
and
bacon
under
an
apple
tree
scattering
pink
petals
beside
the
kitchen
door
with
every
lake
breeze
then
they
went
fishing
and
landed
three
black
bass
douglas
bruce
did
not
mind
one
day
so
much
but
he
resented
two
when
he
greeted
mickey
that
morning
it
was
not
with
the
usual
salutation
of
his
friends
so
the
boy
knew
there
was
something
not
exactly
right
he
was
not
feeling
precisely
jovial
himself
he
was
under
suspended
judgment
he
knew
that
when
bruce
had
time
to
think
and
talk
over
the
situation
with
miss
winton
both
of
them
might
very
probably
agree
with
the
woman
who
said
the
law
would
take
lily
from
him
and
send
her
to
a
charity
home
for
children
mickey
with
his
careful
drilling
on
the
subject
was
in
rebellion
could
the
law
take
lily
from
him
did
the
law
know
anything
her
was
she
in
the
of
the
law
when
he
found
her
would
the
law
have
allowed
her
to
grovelling
in
filth
and
rags
inside
a
few
more
hours
he
had
not
infringed
on
the
law
in
any
way
he
had
merely
saved
a
life
the
law
had
forgotten
to
save
now
when
he
had
it
in
his
possession
and
in
far
better
condition
than
he
found
it
how
had
the
law
to
step
in
and
rob
him
mickey
did
not
understand
while
there
was
nothing
in
his
heart
that
could
teach
him
he
had
found
her
he
would
keep
her
the
orphans
home
should
not
have
her
the
law
should
not
have
her
only
one
possibility
had
any
weight
with
mickey
if
some
one
like
bruce
or
miss
winton
wanted
to
give
her
a
home
of
luxury
could
provide
care
at
once
for
which
he
would
be
forced
to
wait
years
to
earn
the
money
if
they
wanted
her
and
the
carrel
man
of
many
miracles
would
come
for
them
did
he
dare
leave
her
lying
an
hour
when
there
was
even
hope
she
might
be
on
her
feet
there
was
only
one
answer
to
that
with
mickey
but
it
pained
his
heart
so
his
greeting
lacked
its
customary
spontaneity
by
noon
bruce
was
irritable
while
mickey
was
as
nearly
sullen
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
be
at
two
bruce
surrendered
summoned
the
car
and
started
to
the
golf
grounds
he
had
played
three
holes
when
he
overtook
a
man
who
said
a
word
that
arrested
his
attention
so
both
of
them
stopped
and
with
notebooks
and
pencils
under
the
shade
of
a
big
tree
began
discussing
the
question
that
meant
more
to
douglas
than
anything
save
leslie
he
dismissed
mickey
for
the
afternoon
promising
him
that
if
he
would
be
ready
by
six
he
should
be
driven
back
to
the
city
mickey
wanted
to
be
alone
to
concentrate
on
his
problem
but
people
were
everywhere
and
more
coming
by
the
carload
he
could
see
no
place
that
was
then
or
would
be
undisturbed
the
long
road
with
grassy
sides
gave
big
promises
of
leading
somewhere
to
the
quiet
retreat
he
sought
telling
the
driver
that
if
he
were
not
back
by
six
he
would
be
waiting
down
the
road
mickey
started
on
foot
in
thought
so
deep
he
scarcely
appreciated
the
grasses
he
trod
the
perfume
in
his
nostrils
the
concert
in
his
ears
what
did
at
last
arouse
him
was
the
fact
that
he
was
very
thirsty
that
made
him
realize
that
this
was
the
warmest
day
of
the
season
instantly
his
mind
flew
to
the
mite
of
a
girl
lying
so
patiently
watching
the
clock
for
his
coming
living
for
the
sound
of
his
feet
mickey
stopped
studying
the
landscape
a
cool
gentle
breeze
crossed
the
clover
field
beside
the
way
refreshing
him
in
its
passing
he
sucked
his
lungs
full
then
lifted
his
cap
shaking
the
hair
from
his
forehead
he
stuffed
the
cap
into
his
pocket
walking
slowly
along
intending
to
stop
at
the
nearest
farmhouse
to
ask
for
water
but
the
first
home
was
not
to
mickey
liking
he
went
on
passing
another
and
another
then
he
came
to
land
that
attracted
him
the
fences
were
so
straight
the
corners
so
clean
where
they
were
empty
so
delightful
where
they
were
filled
with
alder
wild
plum
hawthorn
attractive
locations
for
the
birds
of
the
bushes
that
were
field
and
orchard
feeders
then
the
barn
and
outbuildings
looked
so
neat
and
prosperous
grazing
cattle
in
rank
meadows
were
so
sleek
then
a
big
white
house
began
to
peep
from
the
screen
of
vines
bushes
and
trees
well
if
the
water
here
gives
you
fever
it
will
anywhere
said
mickey
and
turning
in
at
the
open
gate
started
up
a
walk
having
flower
beds
on
each
side
there
was
a
wide
grassy
lawn
where
the
big
trees
scattered
around
afforded
almost
complete
shade
mickey
never
had
seen
a
home
like
it
closely
he
scarcely
could
realize
that
there
were
places
in
the
world
where
families
lived
alone
like
this
he
tried
to
think
how
he
would
feel
if
he
belonged
there
when
he
reached
the
place
where
he
saw
lily
on
a
comfort
under
a
big
pear
tree
his
throat
grew
hard
his
eyes
dry
and
his
feet
heavy
then
the
screen
to
the
front
door
swung
back
as
a
smiling
woman
in
a
tidy
gingham
dress
came
through
and
stood
awaiting
mickey
i
just
told
peter
when
he
came
back
alone
i
bet
a
penny
you
got
off
at
the
wrong
stop
she
cried
i
so
glad
you
found
your
way
by
yourself
but
you
must
be
tired
and
hot
walking
come
right
in
and
have
a
glass
of
milk
then
strip
your
feet
and
i
ring
for
junior
for
one
second
mickey
was
dazed
the
next
he
knew
what
it
must
mean
these
people
were
the
kind
whom
god
had
made
so
big
and
generous
they
divided
home
and
summer
with
tenement
children
from
the
big
city
thirty
miles
away
some
boy
was
coming
for
a
week
maybe
into
what
exactly
filled
mickey
idea
of
heaven
but
he
was
not
the
boy
breaks
my
heart
to
tell
you
he
said
but
i
ai
the
boy
you
expecting
i
just
taking
a
walk
and
i
thought
maybe
you
let
me
have
a
drink
i
wanted
one
past
the
last
three
houses
but
none
looked
as
if
they
have
half
such
good
cool
water
as
this
now
do
that
beat
the
nation
exclaimed
the
woman
the
multiopolis
papers
are
just
oozing
sympathy
for
the
poor
city
children
who
are
wild
for
woods
and
water
and
when
i
got
myself
nerved
up
to
try
one
and
thought
it
over
till
i
was
really
anxious
about
it
and
got
my
children
all
worked
up
too
here
for
the
second
time
peter
knocks
off
plowing
and
goes
to
the
trolley
to
meet
one
and
he
does
come
i
got
a
notion
to
write
the
editor
of
the
and
tell
him
my
experience
i
think
it
funny
but
you
wanted
water
come
this
way
mickey
followed
a
footpath
white
with
pear
petals
around
the
big
house
and
standing
beside
a
pump
waited
while
the
woman
stepped
to
the
back
porch
for
a
cup
he
took
it
drinking
slowly
thank
you
he
said
as
he
handed
it
back
turning
to
the
path
yesterday
had
weakened
his
nerve
he
was
going
to
cry
again
he
took
a
quick
step
forward
but
the
woman
was
beside
him
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
wait
a
minute
she
said
sit
on
this
bench
under
the
pear
tree
i
want
to
ask
you
something
excuse
me
and
rest
until
i
come
back
mickey
leaned
against
the
tree
shutting
his
eyes
fighting
with
all
his
might
he
was
too
big
to
cry
the
woman
would
think
him
a
coward
as
bruce
had
then
things
happened
as
they
actually
do
at
times
the
woman
hurriedly
came
from
the
door
sat
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
said
i
went
in
there
to
watch
you
through
the
window
but
i
stand
this
a
second
longer
you
poor
child
you
now
tell
me
right
straight
what
the
matter
mickey
tried
but
no
sound
came
the
woman
patted
his
shoulder
now
does
it
beat
the
band
she
said
to
the
backyard
in
general
just
a
little
fellow
not
in
long
trousers
yet
and
bearing
such
a
burden
he
ca
talk
i
guess
maybe
god
has
a
hand
in
this
i
not
so
sure
my
boy
has
come
after
all
who
are
you
and
where
are
you
going
you
want
to
send
your
ma
word
you
will
stay
here
a
week
with
me
mickey
lifted
a
bewildered
face
why
i
could
lady
he
said
brokenly
but
gaining
control
as
he
went
on
i
must
work
bruce
needs
me
i
a
regular
plute
compared
with
most
of
the
you
would
want
to
do
anything
for
me
who
has
so
much
but
if
you
honestly
thinking
about
taking
a
boy
and
he
has
come
how
would
you
like
to
have
a
little
girl
in
his
place
a
little
girl
about
long
and
wide
with
a
face
like
easter
church
flowers
and
rings
of
gold
on
her
head
and
who
would
be
half
the
trouble
a
boy
would
because
she
has
ever
walked
so
she
could
get
into
things
oh
my
goodness
a
crippled
little
girl
she
is
crippled
said
mickey
she
as
straight
as
you
are
what
there
is
of
her
she
had
so
little
food
and
care
her
back
did
seem
to
stiffen
so
her
legs
wo
walk
she
would
be
half
so
much
trouble
as
a
boy
honest
dearest
lady
she
would
who
are
you
asked
the
woman
mickey
produced
a
satisfactory
pedigree
and
gave
unquestionable
references
which
she
recognized
for
she
slowly
nodded
at
the
names
of
chaffner
and
bruce
and
who
is
the
little
girl
you
are
asking
me
to
take
mickey
studied
the
woman
and
then
began
to
talk
cautiously
at
first
ashamed
to
admit
the
squalor
and
the
awful
truth
of
how
he
had
found
the
thing
he
loved
then
gathering
courage
he
began
what
ended
in
an
outpouring
the
woman
watched
him
listening
and
when
mickey
had
no
further
word
she
is
only
a
tiny
girl
she
asked
wonderingly
the
littlest
girl
you
ever
saw
said
mickey
perfectly
helpless
marvelled
the
woman
oh
no
she
can
sit
up
and
use
her
hands
said
mickey
she
can
feed
herself
write
on
her
slate
and
learn
her
lessons
it
only
that
she
stays
put
she
has
to
be
lifted
if
she
moved
you
lift
her
queried
the
woman
could
with
one
hand
said
mickey
tersely
you
say
this
young
lawyer
you
work
for
whose
name
i
see
in
the
connected
with
the
investigation
going
on
is
at
the
club
house
now
she
asked
yes
answered
mickey
he
coming
past
here
this
evening
she
pursued
mickey
explained
about
how
much
waiting
on
would
your
little
girl
take
she
asked
next
well
just
at
present
she
does
the
waiting
on
me
said
mickey
you
see
dearest
lady
i
have
to
get
her
washed
and
fix
her
breakfast
and
her
lunch
beside
the
bed
and
be
downtown
by
seven
and
i
get
back
six
then
i
wash
her
again
to
freshen
her
up
and
cook
her
supper
then
she
says
her
lesson
her
prayers
and
goes
to
sleep
so
you
see
it
mostly
waiting
on
a
boy
could
be
less
trouble
than
that
could
he
it
does
seem
like
it
said
the
woman
and
no
matter
how
much
bother
she
was
i
guess
i
could
stand
it
for
a
week
if
she
such
a
little
girl
and
ca
walk
the
difficulty
is
this
i
promised
my
son
junior
a
boy
and
his
heart
is
so
set
he
wild
about
the
city
going
to
be
gone
before
we
know
it
he
does
seem
to
care
for
anything
we
have
or
do
i
do
know
just
what
he
hoped
to
get
out
of
a
city
boy
but
i
promised
him
one
then
i
felt
scared
and
wrote
chaffner
how
it
was
and
asked
him
to
send
me
a
real
nice
boy
who
could
be
trusted
if
it
were
not
for
junior
mary
and
the
little
man
would
be
delighted
well
never
mind
said
mickey
i
go
see
the
nurse
lady
and
maybe
she
can
think
of
a
plan
anyway
i
do
know
as
it
would
be
best
for
lily
if
she
came
here
a
week
seems
like
it
would
kill
me
to
take
her
back
and
i
do
know
how
she
bear
staying
alone
all
day
after
she
had
got
used
to
company
and
pretty
soon
now
it
going
to
get
so
hot
top
floors
in
the
city
that
if
she
had
a
week
like
this
going
back
would
make
her
sick
you
must
give
me
time
to
think
said
the
woman
peter
will
soon
be
home
to
supper
i
talk
it
over
with
him
and
with
junior
and
see
what
they
think
where
could
you
be
found
in
multiopolis
we
drive
in
every
few
days
we
like
to
go
ourselves
and
there
no
other
way
to
satisfy
the
children
they
get
so
tired
and
lonesome
in
the
country
mickey
was
aghast
they
why
it
does
seem
possible
i
wish
i
could
trade
jobs
with
junior
for
a
while
what
is
his
work
he
drives
the
creamery
wagon
answered
the
woman
o
lord
mickey
burst
forth
excuse
me
i
mean
oh
my
drives
a
real
live
horse
along
these
streets
and
gathers
up
the
cream
cans
we
pass
at
the
gates
and
takes
them
to
the
trolley
yes
she
said
and
he
give
up
job
for
blacking
somebody
shoes
or
carrying
papers
or
running
errands
or
being
shut
up
all
summer
in
a
big
hot
building
oh
my
when
will
you
be
our
way
again
asked
the
woman
i
talk
this
over
with
peter
if
we
decided
to
try
the
little
girl
and
she
did
the
as
you
say
she
could
be
much
trouble
i
should
think
we
could
manage
her
and
a
boy
too
i
wish
you
could
be
the
boy
i
like
to
have
i
been
thinking
if
we
could
get
a
boy
to
show
junior
what
it
is
he
wants
to
know
about
a
city
he
be
better
satisfied
at
home
but
i
do
know
it
just
possible
it
might
make
him
worse
now
such
an
understanding
boy
as
you
seem
to
be
maybe
you
could
teach
junior
things
about
the
city
that
would
make
him
contented
at
do
you
think
you
could
dearest
lady
i
you
said
mickey
i
think
i
could
well
if
you
really
wished
me
to
i
could
take
your
junior
to
multiopolis
with
me
for
a
week
and
make
him
so
sick
he
never
want
to
see
a
city
again
while
his
palpitator
was
running
said
the
lady
slowly
her
eyes
on
far
distance
let
me
think
i
do
know
but
that
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
all
of
us
we
have
land
enough
for
a
nice
farm
for
both
boys
and
the
way
things
look
now
land
seems
about
as
sure
as
anything
we
could
give
them
a
farm
apiece
when
we
are
done
with
it
and
the
girl
the
money
to
take
to
her
home
when
she
marries
i
would
love
to
know
that
junior
was
going
to
live
on
land
as
his
father
does
but
all
his
life
he
talked
about
working
in
the
city
when
he
grows
up
well
if
you
want
him
cured
of
that
gim
me
the
job
he
grinned
you
see
lady
i
know
the
city
inside
out
and
outside
in
again
i
been
playing
the
game
with
it
since
i
can
remember
you
ca
tell
me
anything
i
do
know
about
the
lowest
poorest
side
of
it
oh
i
could
tell
you
things
that
would
make
your
head
swim
if
you
want
your
boy
dosed
just
sick
as
a
horse
on
what
a
workingman
gets
in
multiopolis
sunrise
alley
and
biddle
boulevard
just
you
turn
him
over
to
me
a
week
i
fix
him
i
make
the
creamery
job
look
like
charioteering
for
the
angels
to
him
honest
i
will
lady
and
he
ever
it
either
he
come
through
with
a
lump
in
his
neck
and
a
twist
in
his
stummick
that
means
home
and
mother
see
the
woman
looked
at
mickey
in
and
amazement
well
if
i
ever
she
gasped
if
you
do
believe
me
try
it
said
mickey
well
well
i
have
to
think
she
said
i
do
know
but
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
it
could
be
done
well
do
you
have
any
misgivings
about
it
being
done
said
mickey
it
being
every
day
i
know
men
hundreds
of
them
just
scraping
and
slaving
and
half
starving
to
get
together
the
dough
to
pull
out
i
hear
it
on
the
cars
on
the
streets
and
see
it
in
the
papers
they
jumping
their
jobs
and
going
every
day
while
hundreds
of
schmeltzenschimmers
hansons
and
pietros
are
coming
in
to
take
their
places
multiopolis
is
more
than
half
filled
with
from
across
the
ocean
now
instead
of
home
folks
cradles
as
it
should
be
if
junior
has
got
a
hankering
for
multiopolis
that
is
going
to
cut
him
out
of
owning
a
place
like
this
and
bossing
his
own
job
dearest
lady
cook
him
cook
him
quick
would
you
come
here
she
questioned
would
i
cried
mickey
well
try
me
and
see
i
deeply
interested
in
what
you
say
about
junior
she
said
talk
it
over
with
peter
well
i
do
know
said
mickey
he
might
put
the
grand
kibosh
on
it
hard
but
if
junior
came
back
asking
polite
for
his
mush
and
milk
and
offering
his
christmas
pennies
for
the
privilege
of
plowing
or
driving
the
cream
wagon
believe
me
dear
lady
then
peter
would
fall
on
your
neck
and
weep
for
joy
yes
in
that
event
he
would
said
the
lady
and
the
temptation
is
so
great
that
i
believe
if
you
give
me
your
address
i
look
you
up
the
next
time
i
come
to
multiopolis
which
will
be
soon
i
like
to
see
your
lily
before
i
make
any
promises
if
i
thought
i
could
manage
i
could
bring
her
right
out
in
the
car
tell
me
where
to
find
you
and
i
see
what
peter
thinks
mickey
grinned
widely
you
ai
no
suffragette
lady
are
you
he
commented
well
i
do
know
about
that
said
the
lady
there
are
a
good
many
things
to
think
of
these
days
yes
i
know
said
mickey
but
as
long
as
everything
you
say
swings
the
circle
and
rounds
up
with
peter
it
no
job
to
guess
what
most
important
in
your
peter
must
be
some
pumpkins
come
to
think
of
it
he
is
mickey
she
said
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
sort
of
revolve
around
peter
we
always
plan
together
not
that
we
always
alike
there
are
some
things
i
just
make
peter
see
that
i
wish
i
but
i
would
trade
peter
no
i
guess
he
top
crust
laughed
mickey
he
is
so
said
the
woman
how
did
you
say
i
could
reach
you
well
the
easiest
way
would
be
this
here
i
write
the
number
for
you
fine
said
the
woman
i
hurry
through
my
shopping
and
call
you
when
would
it
suit
you
best
never
mind
me
said
mickey
for
this
i
come
when
you
say
what
about
three
in
the
afternoon
then
sure
cried
mickey
suits
me
splendid
mostly
quit
for
the
day
then
but
i
do
know
about
this
lily
is
used
to
anybody
but
me
she
may
be
afraid
to
come
with
you
and
i
may
think
i
would
scarcely
want
to
try
to
take
care
of
her
for
a
week
when
i
see
her
said
the
woman
you
may
think
that
now
but
you
change
your
mind
when
you
see
her
said
mickey
dearest
lady
when
you
see
a
little
white
girl
that
has
ever
walked
smiling
up
at
you
shy
and
timid
you
wo
be
any
more
anxious
for
orphings
homes
and
charity
palaces
to
swallow
her
up
than
i
am
not
a
bit
all
i
must
think
of
is
what
lily
will
say
about
coming
she
never
been
out
of
my
room
since
i
found
her
and
she
has
seen
any
one
but
bruce
so
she
be
afraid
and
worried
is
all
i
ask
of
what
i
up
against
is
what
going
to
say
and
how
i
going
to
take
her
after
a
week
here
when
it
will
be
hotter
there
and
lonesomer
than
ever
you
surely
give
one
things
to
think
about
commented
the
woman
do
i
queried
mickey
well
i
do
know
as
i
should
probably
with
peter
and
three
children
of
your
own
and
this
farm
to
run
you
are
busy
enough
without
spending
any
of
your
time
on
me
the
command
in
the
good
book
is
plain
ye
one
burdens
quoted
the
woman
oh
yes
of
course
agreed
mickey
but
that
could
mean
lily
she
nothing
but
joy
just
pure
joy
all
about
her
is
that
a
fellow
loves
her
so
that
it
keeps
him
laying
awake
at
nights
thinking
how
to
do
what
would
be
for
her
she
mine
and
going
to
her
that
the
surest
thing
you
know
if
i
take
you
to
see
lily
and
if
i
decide
to
let
you
have
her
a
few
days
to
rest
her
and
fresh
her
up
you
would
go
and
want
to
put
her
the
orphings
home
kids
would
you
you
would
think
she
ought
to
be
took
from
me
and
raised
in
a
flock
of
every
kind
from
every
place
would
you
lady
no
i
would
said
the
lady
i
see
how
you
feel
and
i
am
sure
i
would
want
that
for
one
of
mine
well
there
no
question
about
her
being
said
mickey
but
i
like
you
so
maybe
i
let
you
me
a
a
big
boy
that
can
run
and
play
does
need
you
dearest
lady
half
so
much
as
my
little
girl
do
you
think
he
does
no
i
think
the
lord
sent
you
straight
here
if
you
do
stop
i
be
so
worked
up
i
ca
rest
i
may
come
mickey
arose
holding
out
his
hand
thank
you
dearest
lady
he
said
i
must
be
getting
out
where
the
car
wo
pass
without
my
seeing
it
you
wait
at
the
gate
a
minute
she
said
i
want
to
send
in
a
little
basket
of
things
i
have
it
ready
in
a
jiffy
mickey
slowly
walked
to
the
gate
when
the
woman
came
with
a
basket
covered
with
a
white
cloth
he
thanked
her
again
as
he
took
it
he
rested
his
head
against
her
arm
smiling
up
at
her
with
his
wide
true
eyes
a
thing
i
ca
understand
is
he
said
why
when
the
lord
was
making
mothers
he
did
cut
all
of
them
from
the
same
piece
he
did
you
just
walk
on
down
the
road
and
smell
june
beside
this
clover
field
is
it
yours
yes
she
said
would
you
care
if
i
take
just
a
few
to
lily
i
know
she
never
saw
any
take
a
bunch
as
big
as
your
head
if
you
want
them
lily
is
so
little
three
will
do
her
just
as
well
besides
she
got
to
remember
how
we
are
fixed
so
she
need
begin
to
expect
things
to
come
her
way
by
baskets
and
bunches
said
mickey
she
bound
to
be
spoiled
bad
enough
as
it
is
i
ca
see
how
i
going
to
come
out
with
her
but
she
mine
and
i
going
to
keep
her
mickey
laughed
the
woman
do
you
think
you
swing
around
to
lily
just
about
the
way
i
do
to
peter
well
maybe
i
do
conceded
mickey
what
kind
of
a
car
did
you
say
bruce
has
oh
the
car
is
dark
green
and
the
driver
has
sandy
hair
and
bruce
why
you
know
him
anywhere
just
look
for
the
finest
man
you
ever
saw
if
you
are
out
when
he
goes
by
and
that
will
be
douglas
bruce
i
guess
i
know
him
if
i
happen
to
be
out
sure
lady
you
could
miss
him
replied
mickey
carefully
holding
his
basket
he
went
down
the
road
the
woman
made
supper
an
hour
late
standing
beside
the
gate
watching
for
a
green
car
many
whirled
past
then
at
last
one
with
the
right
look
came
gliding
along
so
she
stepped
out
and
raised
her
hand
for
a
parley
the
car
stopped
douglas
bruce
she
asked
at
your
service
madam
he
answered
just
a
word
with
you
she
said
he
arose
instantly
swung
open
the
car
door
and
stepping
down
walked
with
her
to
the
shade
of
a
big
widely
branching
maple
the
woman
looked
at
him
and
said
flushing
and
half
confused
please
to
excuse
me
for
halting
you
but
i
had
a
reason
this
afternoon
such
an
attractive
little
fellow
stopped
here
to
ask
for
a
drink
in
passing
now
peter
and
i
had
decided
we
try
our
hand
at
taking
a
city
boy
for
a
week
or
so
for
his
vacation
and
twice
peter
has
left
his
work
and
gone
to
the
trolley
station
to
fetch
him
and
he
failed
us
i
supposed
peter
had
missed
him
so
when
i
saw
the
boy
coming
just
the
first
glimpse
my
heart
went
right
out
to
him
very
likely
assented
bruce
he
surely
is
the
most
winning
little
chap
i
ever
saw
with
his
keen
blue
eyes
and
that
sort
of
light
on
his
forehead
said
the
woman
i
noticed
that
put
in
the
man
yes
she
said
anybody
would
see
that
almost
the
first
thing
so
i
thought
he
was
the
boy
i
was
to
mother
coming
and
i
went
right
at
the
job
he
told
me
quick
enough
that
i
was
mistaken
but
i
could
see
he
was
in
trouble
someway
i
trust
him
with
my
character
or
my
money
but
i
got
to
be
perfectly
sure
before
i
trust
him
with
my
children
you
see
i
have
three
and
if
ever
any
of
them
go
wrong
i
do
want
it
to
be
because
i
was
i
thought
i
like
to
have
him
around
some
my
oldest
boy
is
bigger
but
just
about
his
age
he
said
he
might
be
out
this
way
with
you
this
summer
and
i
wanted
to
ask
him
in
and
do
what
i
could
to
entertain
him
but
first
i
wanted
to
inquire
of
you
i
see
said
douglas
bruce
i
have
known
mickey
so
long
but
owing
to
the
circumstances
in
which
i
met
him
and
the
association
with
him
since
i
feel
that
i
know
him
better
than
i
could
most
boys
in
a
longer
time
the
strongest
thing
i
can
say
to
you
is
this
had
i
a
boy
of
my
own
i
should
be
proud
if
mickey
liked
him
and
would
consider
being
friends
with
him
he
is
absolutely
trustworthy
that
i
know
then
i
wo
detain
your
further
she
said
mickey
cheered
in
mind
and
heart
had
walked
ahead
briskly
with
his
basket
while
as
he
went
he
formulated
his
plans
he
would
go
straight
to
the
sunshine
nurse
tell
her
about
the
heat
and
this
possible
chance
to
take
lily
to
the
country
for
a
week
and
consult
with
her
as
to
what
the
effect
of
the
trip
might
be
and
what
he
could
do
with
her
afterward
then
he
would
understand
better
he
kept
watching
the
clover
field
beside
the
way
when
he
decided
he
had
reached
the
finest
best
perfumed
place
he
saw
a
man
plowing
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
and
thought
it
might
be
peter
and
that
peter
would
wonder
what
he
was
doing
in
his
field
so
mickey
set
the
basket
in
a
corner
and
advanced
he
was
wonderfully
elated
by
what
had
happened
to
him
and
the
conclusions
at
which
he
had
arrived
as
he
came
across
the
deep
grasses
beside
the
fence
where
the
pink
of
wild
rose
and
the
snow
of
alder
commingled
where
song
sparrows
trilled
and
larks
and
quail
were
calling
he
approached
smiling
in
utter
confidence
as
he
looked
at
the
man
at
his
height
his
strong
open
face
his
grip
on
the
plow
he
realized
why
the
world
of
the
little
woman
revolved
around
peter
mickey
could
have
conceived
of
few
happier
fates
than
being
attached
to
peter
so
he
thought
in
amazement
of
the
boy
who
wanted
to
leave
him
then
a
slow
grin
spread
over
his
face
for
by
this
time
peter
had
stopped
his
horses
and
was
awaiting
him
with
an
answering
smile
and
hand
outstretched
why
son
i
glad
to
see
you
he
cried
how
did
i
come
to
miss
you
did
you
get
off
at
the
wrong
stop
mickey
shook
his
head
as
he
took
the
proffered
hand
you
are
peter
he
asked
yes
i
peter
confirmed
the
man
well
you
making
the
same
mistake
your
pleasant
lady
did
explained
mickey
she
thought
i
was
the
boy
who
had
been
sent
to
visit
you
so
she
gave
me
the
glad
hand
too
i
wish
i
was
in
his
shoes
but
i
not
your
boy
gee
your
lady
is
a
nice
gentle
lady
you
all
correct
there
agreed
peter
and
so
you
are
not
the
boy
who
was
to
be
sent
us
pshaw
now
i
wish
you
were
i
disappointed
i
been
watching
you
coming
down
the
road
and
the
way
you
held
together
and
stepped
up
so
brisk
and
neat
took
my
eye
i
been
up
brisk
and
neat
to
sell
papers
run
errands
hop
cars
dodge
cars
and
automobiles
and
climbing
instead
of
stairs
and
keeping
from
under
foot
since
i
can
remember
laughed
mickey
you
learn
on
the
streets
of
multiopolis
to
step
up
and
watch
sharp
without
knowing
you
are
doing
it
you
a
newsboy
asked
peter
i
was
all
my
life

few
days

mickey

i
went
into
the
office
of
douglas
bruce

corporation

the
iriquois

mickey

after

of
them
big

bleeding
the
taxpayers
of
multiopolis
some
of
these
days
if
you
watch
your
sharp
you
going
to
see
the
lid
fly
off
of
two
or
three
things
at
once
he
on
a
hot
trail
now
why
i
have
seen
that

the
papers

peter

given
the
job
of

james
minturn

your
pleasant
lady

a
few
clover
flowers

little
sick
girl
and
just
as
i
came
to
the
finest
ones
in
the
field
i
saw
you
so
i
thought
maybe
i
better
tell
you
what
i
was
doing
before
you
fired
me
take
all
you
want
said
peter
i
like
to
send
the
whole
field
larks
and
all
to
a
little
sick
girl
i
like
especial
to
send
her
some
of
these
clowny
bobolink
fellows
to
puff
up
and
spill
music
by
the
quart
for
her
i
guess
nothing
else
runs
so
smooth
except
water
i
do
know
what
she
say
said
mickey
gazing
around
him
you
see
she
has
ever
walked
so
all
she
seen
in
her
life
has
been
the
worst
kind
of
bare
dark
tenement
walls
lately
she
got
a
high
window
where
she
can
see
sky
and
a
few
sparrows
that
come
for
crumbs
this
mickey
swept
his
arm
toward
the
landscape
i
do
know
what
she
say
to
this
pshaw
now
cried
peter
why
bring
her
out
you
bring
her
right
out
that
what
we
been
wanting
to
know
just
what
a
city
child
would
of
country
things
she
never
seen
before
bring
her
to
see
us
she
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
and
she
ca
walk
you
know
explained
mickey
poor
little
mite
that
too
bad
lamented
peter
wonder
if
she
could
be
doctored
up
it
a
shame
she
ca
walk
but
taking
care
of
her
must
be
easy
oh
she
takes
care
of
herself
said
mickey
you
see
she
is
alone
all
day
from
six
six
she
must
take
care
of
herself
so
she
studies
her
lesson
and
plays
with
her
doll
i
mean
her
precious
child
too
bad
said
peter
by
jacks
that
a
sin
did
you
happen
to
speak
to
ma
about
her
we
did
talk
a
little
admitted
mickey
she
was
telling
me
of
the
visitor
boy
who
did
come
and
your
son
who
does
think
he
want
to
stay
so
we
got
to
talking
she
said
just
what
you
did
about
wanting
to
see
how
a
city
child
who
had
ever
seen
a
chicken
or
a
cow
or
horse
would
act
good
lord
cried
peter
there
a
child
in
multiopolis
who
ever
seen
a
little
chicken
or
a
calf
hundreds
of
them
said
mickey
i
scarcely
seen
a
cow
myself
seen
hens
and
little
chickens
in
shop
windows
at
easter
time
but
not
in
the
orchard
in
june
queried
peter
no
in
the
orchard
in
june
said
mickey
well
well
marvelled
peter
there
nothing
so
true
as
that
half
does
know
how
the
other
half
lives
i
heard
that
but
i
did
quite
sense
it
and
i
do
know
as
i
do
yet
you
bring
her
right
out
your
pleasant
lady
talked
about
that
but
you
see
bringing
her
out
and
showing
her
these
things
and
getting
her
used
to
them
is
thing
then
taking
her
back
to
a
room
so
hot
i
always
sleep
on
the
and
where
she
has
to
stay
all
day
alone
is
i
do
know
but
so
long
as
she
must
go
to
what
she
has
now
it
would
be
better
to
her
there
humph
i
see
what
a
pity
exclaimed
peter
well
if
you
be
coming
this
way
again
stop
and
see
us
i
talk
to
ma
about
her
we
often
take
a
little
run
to
multiopolis
junior
would
be
satisfied
till
we
got
a
car
and
i
ca
say
we
ai
enjoying
it
ourselves
what
was
that
you
were
saying
about
my
boy
not
thinking
he
stay
told
me
said
mickey
about
the
city
bug
he
had
in
his
system
why
do
you
swat
it
immediate
what
do
you
mean
inquired
peter
turn
him
over
to
me
a
week
or
two
suggested
mickey
i
can
give
him
a
dose
of
working
in
a
city
that
will
send
him
hiking
back
to
home
and
father
it
worth
considering
said
peter
i
know
that
what
i
got
of
multiopolis
would
make
me
feel
like
von
hindenberg
if
i
had
the
job
of
handling
the
ribbons
of
your
creamery
wagon
and
so
i
know
about
what
would
put
sonny
back
on
the
farm
tickled
to
death
to
be
here
by
gum
well
i
give
you
just
one
hundred
dollars
if
you
do
it
exclaimed
peter
you
see
my
grandfather
and
father
owned
this
land
before
me
we
been
on
the
plowing
job
so
long
we
have
it
reduced
to
a
system
so
it
comes
easy
for
me
and
i
take
pride
and
pleasure
in
it
i
had
supposed
my
boys
would
be
the
same
do
you
really
think
you
could
manage
it
sure
said
mickey
only
if
you
really
mean
it
not
now
nor
ever
do
you
want
son
to
it
see
the
medicine
would
work
if
he
knew
he
took
it
well
i
be
jiggered
laughed
peter
i
guess
you
could
do
it
if
you
went
at
it
right
well
you
trust
me
to
do
it
right
grinned
mickey
loan
me
sonny
for
a
week
or
two
and
you
can
have
him
back
for
keeps
well
it
worth
trying
said
peter
say
when
will
you
be
this
way
again
any
day
said
mickey
and
your
lady
said
she
be
in
multiopolis
soon
so
we
are
sure
to
have
a
happy
meeting
before
long
i
think
that
is
bruce
car
coming
goodbye
be
good
to
yourself
with
a
spring
from
where
he
was
standing
mickey
arose
in
air
alighted
on
the
top
rail
of
the
division
fence
then
balancing
he
raced
down
it
toward
the
road
peter
watched
him
in
astonishment
then
went
back
to
his
plowing
with
many
new
things
on
his
mind
thus
it
happened
that
after
supper
when
the
children
were
in
bed
and
he
and
his
wife
went
to
the
front
veranda
for
their
usual
evening
visit
and
talk
over
the
day
she
had
very
little
to
tell
him
as
was
her
custom
she
removed
her
apron
brushed
her
waving
hair
and
wore
a
fresh
dress
she
rocked
gently
in
her
wicker
chair
while
her
voice
was
moved
to
unusual
solicitude
as
she
spoke
peter
also
had
performed
a
rite
he
spoke
of
as
brushing
up
for
evening
he
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
soap
and
water
so
his
body
as
well
as
his
clothing
was
clean
he
sat
on
the
top
step
leaning
against
the
pillar
where
the
moonlight
emphasized
his
big
frame
accented
the
strong
lines
of
his
face
and
crowned
his
thick
hair
as
nancy
harding
thought
it
should
be
with
glory
peter
she
said
did
you
notice
anything
about
that
boy
this
afternoon
different
from
other
boys
yes
answered
peter
slowly
i
did
nancy
he
did
strike
me
as
being
boy
he
has
the
best
of
three
or
four
concealed
in
his
lean
person
he
had
a
pretty
tough
time
i
judge
said
nancy
yet
you
never
saw
a
boy
who
took
your
heart
like
he
did
and
neither
did
i
answered
peter
mickey
holding
his
basket
and
clover
flowers
was
waiting
when
the
car
drew
up
and
to
bruce
inquiry
answered
that
a
lady
where
he
stopped
for
a
drink
had
given
him
something
for
lily
he
left
the
car
in
the
city
sought
the
nurse
and
luckily
found
her
at
leisure
she
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
to
all
he
had
to
say
it
a
problem
she
said
as
he
finished
to
take
her
to
such
a
place
for
a
week
and
then
bring
her
back
where
she
is
would
be
harder
for
her
than
never
going
i
got
that
figured
said
mickey
but
i
about
made
up
my
mind
after
seeing
the
place
and
thinking
over
the
folks
that
it
that
way
once
they
see
her
and
find
how
little
trouble
she
is
they
not
people
who
would
send
her
back
it
cool
if
they
want
to
then
and
there
this
too
there
are
other
folks
who
would
take
her
now
and
see
about
her
back
have
i
got
the
right
to
let
it
go
a
day
waiting
to
earn
the
money
myself
when
some
one
else
maybe
the
moonshine
lady
or
bruce
would
do
it
and
not
put
her
in
an
orphings
home
either
no
mickey
you
have
said
the
nurse
just
the
way
i
have
it
figured
said
mickey
but
she
mine
and
going
to
her
if
her
back
is
fixed
i
going
to
have
it
done
i
do
want
any
one
else
meddling
with
my
family
you
have
heard
anything
from
the
carrel
man
yet
no
she
said
my
i
wish
he
come
cried
mickey
so
do
i
said
the
nurse
but
so
far
mickey
i
think
you
are
doing
all
right
if
she
must
be
operated
she
have
to
be
put
in
condition
for
it
and
while
i
suspect
i
could
beat
you
at
your
job
i
am
positive
you
are
far
surpassing
what
she
did
have
well
i
know
that
too
said
mickey
but
surpassing
nothing
at
all
is
going
either
far
or
fast
i
must
do
something
if
you
could
bring
yourself
to
consent
to
giving
her
up
suggested
the
nurse
well
i
ca
interposed
mickey
just
for
a
while
continued
the
nurse
not
for
a
minute
i
found
her
she
mine
yes
i
know
but
began
the
nurse
i
know
too
said
mickey
gim
me
a
little
time
he
studied
the
problem
till
he
reached
his
grocery
there
he
thriftily
lifted
the
cloth
to
peep
and
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
pursued
his
way
presently
he
opened
his
door
to
be
struck
by
a
wave
of
hot
air
and
to
note
a
flushed
little
face
and
drawn
mouth
as
he
went
into
outstretched
arms
then
he
delivered
the
carefully
carried
clover
and
the
following
got
these
from
a
big
pink
field
bewildering
that
god
made
for
cows
and
childering
her
share
is
being
consumed
by
the
cow
let
go
roll
in
ours
right
again
demanded
peaches
mickey
repeated
slowly
how
could
we
asked
peaches
easy
said
mickey
repeated
peaches
just
as
easy
reiterated
mickey
did
you
see
it
demanded
peaches
yes
i
saw
it
said
mickey
it
like
this
you
see
some
folks
live
in
houses
all
built
together
and
work
at
selling
things
to
eat
and
wear
and
making
things
and
doing
other
work
that
must
be
done
like
doctors
and
lawyers
and
hospitals
a
then
to
other
folks
live
on
big
pieces
of
land
the
houses
are
far
apart
with
streets
between
and
beside
them
the
big
fields
where
the
wheat
grows
for
our
bread
and
our
potatoes
and
the
grass
and
the
clover
like
this
to
feed
the
cows
bruce
did
play
long
so
i
went
walking
and
stopped
at
a
house
for
a
drink
and
there
was
the
nicest
lady
we
talked
some
and
she
give
me
our
supper
in
that
pretty
basket
and
she
sent
you
the
clovers
from
a
big
pink
field
so
sweet
smelly
it
would
make
you
sick
and
there
are
trees
through
it
and
lots
of
birds
sing
and
there
are
wild
roses
and
fringy
white
flowers
and
it
quiet
the
birds
and
the
roosters
crowing
and
the
wind
comes
in
little
perfumery
blows
on
you
and
such
milk
better
our
milk
asked
peaches
their
milk
is
so
rich
it
makes
ours
look
like
a
poorhouse
relation
scoffed
mickey

me

demanded
peaches

get
the
water
to
wash

pretty
warm
lady
just
the
same
said
mickey
then
he
brought
water
and
leaving
the
door
ajar
for
the
first
time
he
soon
started
a
draft
that
with
the
coming
of
cooler
evening
lowered
the
child
temperature
and
made
her
hungry
as
he
worked
mickey
talked
the
grass
the
blooming
orchard
the
hen
and
her
little
downy
chickens
the
big
cool
porch
the
wonderful
woman
and
man
the
boy
whom
they
expected
and
who
did
not
come
and
then
cautiously
slowly
making
sure
she
understood
he
developed
his
plan
to
take
her
to
the
country
peaches
drew
back
and
opened
her
lips
mickey
promptly
laid
the
washcloth
over
them

a
supper
as
they
neither
one
ever
had
known
during
which
mickey
explained
wheat
fields
and
bread
bees
and
honey
cows
and
clover
pigs
and
ham
as
he
understood
them
peaches
repeated
her
lesson
and
her
prayers
and
then
as
had
become
her
custom
demanded
that
mickey
write
his
last
verse
on
the
slate
so
she
might
learn
and
copy
it
on
the
morrow
she
was
asleep
before
he
finished
mickey
walked
softly
cleared
the
table
placed
it
before
the
window
and
taking
from
his
pocket
an
envelope
bruce
had
given
him
drew
out
a
sheet
of
folded
paper
on
which
he
wrote
long
and
laboriously
then
locking
peaches
in
he
slipped
down
to
the
and
posted
this
letter
dear
mister
carrel
saw
in
papers
i
sold
how
you
put
different
legs
on
a
dog
i
have
a
little
white
that
has
ever
walked
it
her
back
a
nurse
lady
told
me
at
the
star
of
hope
how
you
came
there
sometimes
and
the
next
time
you
come
i
guess
i
will
let
you
see
my
little
girl
and
maybe
i
have
you
fix
her
back
when
you
see
her
you
will
know
that
to
fix
her
back
would
be
the
biggest
thing
you
ever
did
or
ever
could
do
i
got
a
job
that
i
can
pay
her
way
and
mine
and
save
two
dollars
a
week
for
you
i
could
pay
all
at
once
but
i
could
pay
steady
and
if
you
lose
all
you
have
in
any
way
it
would
come
in
real
handy
to
have
that
much
skating
in
steady
as
the
clock
every
week
for
as
long
as
you
say
and
soon
as
i
can
i
make
it
more
i
give
all
i
got
or
ever
can
get
to
cure
lily
back
and
because
you
fixed
the
dog
i
like
you
to
fix
her
i
do
hope
you
will
come
soon
but
of
course
i
do
wish
anybody
else
would
get
sick
so
you
have
to
you
can
ask
if
i
am
square
of
douglas
bruce
iriquois
building
multiopolis
indiana
or
of
chaffner
editor
of
herald
papers
i
sold
since
i
was
big
michael
chapter
xii
with
vigour
renewed
by
a
night
of
rest
leslie
began
her
second
day
at
atwater
cabin
she
had
so
many
and
such
willing
helpers
that
before
noon
she
could
find
nothing
more
to
do
after
lunch
she
felt
a
desire
to
explore
her
new
world
choosing
the
shady
side
she
followed
the
road
toward
the
club
house
but
one
thought
in
her
mind
she
must
return
in
time
to
take
the
car
and
meet
douglas
bruce
as
she
had
promised
she
felt
elated
that
she
had
so
planned
her
summer
as
to
spend
it
with
her
father
while
of
course
it
was
going
to
be
delightful
to
have
her
lover
with
her
so
going
she
came
to
a
most
attractive
lane
that
led
from
the
road
between
tilled
fields
back
to
a
wood
on
one
side
and
open
pasture
on
the
other
faintly
she
heard
the
shouts
of
children
and
yielding
to
sudden
impulse
she
turned
and
followed
the
grassy
path
a
few
more
steps
then
she
stopped
in
surprise
an
automobile
was
standing
on
the
bank
of
a
brook
on
an
indian
blanket
under
a
tree
sat
a
woman
of
fine
appearance
holding
a
book
but
watching
with
smiling
face
the
line
of
the
water
which
spread
in
a
wide
pool
above
a
rudely
constructed
dam
overflowing
it
in
a
small
waterfall
on
either
bank
lay
one
of
the
minturn
boys
muddy
and
damp
trying
with
his
hands
to
catch
something
in
the
water
below
the
dam
in
a
blue
balbriggan
bathing
suit
stood
james
minturn
his
hands
filled
with
a
big
piece
of
sod
which
he
bent
and
applied
to
a
leak
leslie
untied
the
ribbons
of
her
sunshade
and
rumpling
her
hair
to
the
light
breeze
came
forward
laughing
well
mr
minturn
she
cried
what
is
going
to
become
of
the
taxpayers
of
multiopolis
while
their
champion
builds
a
sod
dam
whether
the
flush
on
james
minturn
face
as
he
turned
to
her
was
exertion
embarrassment
or
unpleasant
memory
leslie
could
not
decide
but
she
remembered
after
her
impulsive
greeting
that
she
had
been
with
his
wife
in
that
early
morning
meeting
the
day
of
the
trip
to
the
swamp
she
thought
of
many
things
as
she
went
forward
james
minturn
held
out
his
muddy
hands
as
he
said
laughingly
you
see
i
not
in
condition
for
our
customary
greeting
surely
cried
leslie
it
is
going
to
wash
off
is
it
if
from
you
why
not
from
me
of
course
if
you
want
to
play
he
said
playing
you
honestly
queried
leslie
honestly
playing
answered
the
man
the
playing
in
all
the
world
not
the
political
game
not
the
money
game
not
anything
called
manly
sport
just
a
day
off
with
my
boys
being
a
boy
again
heavens
leslie
i
wild
about
it
i
could
scarcely
sleep
last
night
for
eagerness
to
get
started
but
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
my
family
my
sister
winslow
a
friend
of
mine
miss
leslie
winton
my
sons
tutor
tower
my
little
brother
william
minturn
my
boys
junior
and
malcolm
anyway
we
can
shake
hands
said
leslie
to
winslow
the
habit
is
so
ingrained
i
am
scandalized
on
meeting
people
if
i
forced
to
neglect
it
will
you
share
my
blanket
asked
winslow
thanks
yes
for
a
little
time
said
leslie
i
am
greatly
interested
in
what
is
going
on
here
so
am
i
said
winslow
we
are
engaged
in
the
evolution
of
an
idea
a
real
it
seems
to
be
doing
them
good
commented
leslie
never
mind
the
boys
said
minturn
i
object
to
such
small
men
monopolizing
your
attention
look
at
the
this
is
doing
me
and
would
you
please
tell
me
why
you
are
here
instead
of
disporting
yourself
at
say
lenox
how
funny
laughed
leslie
i
am
out
in
search
of
amusement
and
finding
it
i
think
i
perhaps
a
mile
from
our
home
for
the
summer
you
amaze
me
cried
minturn
i
saw
douglas
this
morning
and
told
him
where
i
was
coming
but
he
never
said
a
word
he
did
know
one
to
say
on
this
subject
explained
leslie
you
see
i
rented
a
cabin
over
at
atwater
and
had
my
plans
made
before
i
told
even
father
what
a
delightful
thing
was
in
store
for
him
but
how
did
it
happen
through
my
seeing
how
desperately
busy
daddy
and
douglas
have
been
all
spring
daddy
especially
replied
leslie
douglas
is
bad
enough
but
father
just
obsessed
so
much
so
that
i
think
he
carrying
double
i
know
he
is
said
minturn
and
so
you
made
a
plan
to
allow
him
to
proceed
with
his
work
all
day
and
then
have
the
delightful
ride
fishing
and
swimming
in
atwater
morning
and
evening
how
wonderful
and
of
course
douglas
will
be
there
also
of
course
agreed
leslie
at
least
he
shall
have
an
invitation
going
to
surprise
him
with
it
this
very
evening
how
do
you
think
like
it
i
think
he
will
be
so
overjoyed
he
wo
know
how
to
express
himself
said
james
minturn
but
is
it
going
to
be
lonely
for
you
wo
you
miss
your
friends
your
frocks
and
your
usual
summer
round
you
forget
said
leslie
my
friends
and
my
frocks
always
have
been
for
winter
all
my
life
i
have
summered
with
father
how
will
you
amuse
yourself
he
asked
it
will
take
some
time
each
day
to
plan
what
to
do
the
next
that
will
bring
most
refreshment
and
joy
i
often
will
be
compelled
to
drive
in
of
mornings
with
orders
for
my
and
when
other
things
are
exhausted
i
am
going
to
make
an
especial
study
of
music
that
is
an
attractive
subject
said
minturn
have
you
really
made
any
progress
little
more
than
verifying
a
few
songs
already
recorded
replied
leslie
i
hear
smatterings
and
snatches
but
they
are
elusive
while
i
not
always
sure
of
the
identity
of
the
bird
but
the
subject
is
thrillingly
tempting
it
surely
is
conceded
minturn
i
could
see
that
nellie
was
alert
the
instant
you
mentioned
it
come
over
here
to
the
shade
and
tell
me
how
far
you
have
gone
you
see
i
undertaken
the
education
malcolm
inherits
his
mother
musical
ability
to
a
wonderful
degree
it
is
possible
that
he
could
be
started
on
this
and
so
begin
his
work
while
he
thinks
he
playing
leslie
walked
to
the
spot
indicated
far
enough
away
that
conversation
would
not
interrupt
winslow
reading
and
near
enough
to
watch
the
boys
she
and
minturn
sat
on
the
grass
and
talked
it
might
be
the
very
thing
said
leslie
whatever
gives
even
a
faint
hope
of
attracting
a
boy
to
an
educational
subject
is
worth
testing
one
thing
i
missed
i
always
have
regretted
said
minturn
i
never
had
educated
musical
comprehension
nellie
performed
and
sang
so
well
and
in
my
soul
i
knew
what
i
could
understand
and
liked
in
music
she
scorned
sometimes
i
thought
if
i
had
known
only
enough
to
appreciate
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
it
might
have
formed
a
slender
tie
between
us
so
i
want
the
boys
both
to
recognize
good
music
when
they
hear
it
but
they
have
so
much
to
learn
all
at
once
poor
little
chaps
i
scarcely
see
where
to
begin
and
in
a
musical
way
i
do
even
know
how
to
begin
tell
me
about
the
birds
leslie
just
what
is
it
you
are
studying
the
strains
of
our
famous
composers
that
are
lifted
bodily
for
measures
at
a
time
from
the
song
of
a
bird
or
indisputably
based
upon
it
answered
leslie
did
you
and
nellie
have
any
success
indeed
yes
we
had
the
royal
luck
to
hear
exactly
the
song
i
had
hoped
and
besides
we
talked
of
many
things
and
nellie
settled
her
future
course
in
her
mind
when
she
went
into
the
swamp
alone
and
came
out
with
an
armload
of
lavender
fringed
orchids
she
meant
to
carry
to
elizabeth
and
her
heart
firmly
resolved
to
begin
a
new
life
with
you
she
told
me
she
felt
like
flying
that
never
had
she
been
so
happy
leslie
paused
glancing
at
james
minturn
he
seemed
puzzled
i
understand
but
nothing
matters
now
tell
me
about
the
birds
he
said
and
it
is
what
you
admit
you
do
understand
that
i
must
tell
you
of
said
leslie
i
been
afraid
horribly
afraid
you
understand
and
that
you
took
some
course
you
would
have
taken
if
you
did
what
happened
in
the
swamp
was
all
my
fault
the
birds
leslie
tell
me
of
the
birds
commanded
james
minturn
you
ca
possibly
know
what
occurred
that
separated
nellie
and
me
no
i
do
know
your
side
of
it
but
i
do
know
hers
and
i
think
you
do
persisted
leslie
now
if
you
would
be
big
enough
to
let
me
tell
you
how
it
was
with
her
that
day
and
what
she
said
to
me
your
mind
would
be
perfectly
at
rest
as
to
the
course
you
have
taken
my
mind
is
at
rest
now
as
to
the
course
i
have
taken
said
minturn
i
realize
that
a
man
should
meet
life
as
it
comes
to
him
i
endured
mine
in
sweating
humiliation
for
years
and
i
would
have
gone
on
to
the
end
if
it
had
been
a
question
of
me
only
but
when
the
girl
was
sacrificed
and
the
boys
in
a
fair
way
to
meet
a
worse
fate
than
hers
the
question
no
longer
hinged
on
me
you
have
seen
my
sons
during
their
mother
régime
when
they
were
children
of
wealth
in
the
care
of
servants
look
at
them
now
and
dare
to
tell
me
that
they
are
not
greatly
improved
surely
they
are
said
leslie
you
did
right
to
rescue
them
from
their
environment
all
the
fault
that
lies
with
you
so
far
is
that
you
did
not
do
from
the
start
what
you
are
now
doing
the
thing
that
haunts
me
is
this
minturn
and
i
must
get
it
out
of
my
mind
before
i
can
sleep
soundly
again
you
will
let
me
tell
you
you
wo
think
me
meddling
in
what
must
be
dreadful
heartache
oh
you
wo
will
you
no
i
wo
said
minturn
but
it
is
prolonging
heartache
to
discuss
this
matter
and
wasting
time
better
used
in
the
building
of
a
sod
dam
indeed
leslie
tell
me
about
the
birds
i
will
if
you
answer
one
question
said
leslie
dangerous
but
i
risk
it
replied
minturn
i
must
ask
two
or
three
minor
ones
to
reach
the
real
one
explained
the
girl
oh
leslie
laughed
minturn
i
did
think
you
were
so
like
the
average
woman
a
large
number
of
men
are
finding
average
woman
quite
delightful
said
leslie
men
respect
a
masculine
argumentative
woman
but
every
time
they
love
and
marry
the
impulsive
changeable
companionable
one
provided
she
be
endowed
with
truth
character
and
common
mother
instinct
enough
to
protect
her
young
yes
i
grant
it
and
glory
in
it
said
minturn
i
can
furnish
logic
for
one
family
and
most
men
i
know
feel
qualified
to
do
the
same
surely
agreed
leslie
you
were
waiting
for
nellie
the
night
she
came
from
the
tamarack
swamp
with
me
and
she
told
me
you
had
a
little
box
and
that
with
its
contents
you
had
threatened
to
her
soul
if
she
had
a
soul
i
be
logical
and
fair
and
ask
but
the
question
i
first
stipulated
here
it
is
did
you
wait
until
you
made
sure
she
had
a
soul
worthy
of
your
consideration
before
you
froze
it
james
minturn
laugh
was
ugly
to
hear
my
dear
girl
he
said
i
made
sure
she
had
three
years
ago
and
i
made
equally
sure
that
she
had
said
leslie
in
the
tamarack
swamp
when
she
wrestled
as
jacob
at
peniel
against
her
birth
her
environment
her
wealth
and
triumphed
over
all
of
them
for
you
and
her
sons
i
ca
go
on
with
my
own
plan
for
personal
happiness
until
i
know
for
sure
if
you
perfectly
understand
that
she
came
to
you
that
night
to
confess
to
you
her
faults
errors
mistakes
sins
if
need
be
and
ask
you
to
take
the
head
of
your
household
and
to
help
her
fashion
each
hour
of
her
life
anew
did
she
have
a
chance
to
tell
you
all
this
no
said
minturn
but
it
would
have
made
difference
if
she
had
it
came
too
late
you
have
not
the
right
to
say
that
to
any
living
suffering
human
being
protested
leslie
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
say
it
to
her
said
minturn
a
right
that
would
be
justified
in
any
court
in
the
world
either
of
lawyers
or
people
then
thank
god
nellie
gets
her
trial
higher
he
will
understand
and
forgive
her
you
do
know
what
she
did
said
minturn
what
she
stood
before
me
and
the
officers
of
the
law
and
admitted
she
did
i
do
care
what
she
did
there
were
men
forgiven
on
the
cross
because
they
sincerely
repented
god
had
mercy
on
them
so
he
will
on
her
and
what
more
he
wo
have
any
on
unless
you
follow
his
example
and
forgive
when
you
are
asked
by
a
woman
who
is
as
deeply
repentant
as
she
was
her
repentance
comes
too
late
said
minturn
with
finality
her
error
is
there
is
no
such
thing
as
true
repentance
being
too
late
insisted
leslie
you
are
distinctly
commanded
to
forgive
you
have
got
to
do
it
there
is
no
error
that
is
reparable
since
you
hint
tragedy
i
will
concede
it
if
she
had
been
directly
responsible
for
the
death
of
her
child
it
was
a
mistake
criminal
carelessness
but
not
a
thing
purposely
planned
so
she
could
atone
for
it
by
doing
her
best
for
you
and
the
boys
any
mother
who
once
did
the
things
she
did
is
not
fit
to
be
trusted
again
what
nonsense

minturn
you
amaze
me
said
leslie
that
is
a
little
too
cold
masculine
logic
that
is
taking
from
the
whole
human
race
the
power
to
repent
of
and
repair
a
mistake
there
are
some
mistakes
that
can
not
be
repaired
i
grant
it
said
leslie
there
are
are
making
one
right
now
that
the
most
strictly
feminine
utterance
i
ever
heard
said
minturn
with
a
short
laugh
thank
you
retorted
leslie
the
compliment
is
high
but
i
accept
it
i
ask
nothing
better
at
the
hands
of
fate
than
to
be
the
most
feminine
of
women
and
i
told
you
what
i
feel
forced
to
you
can
now
go
on
with
your
plans
knowing
they
are
exactly
what
she
had
mapped
out
hastily
but
surely
she
said
to
me
that
she
must
build
from
the
foundations
which
meant
a
new
home
you
are
fatuously
mistaken
said
minturn
she
said
to
me
reiterated
leslie
forcefully
that
for
ten
years
she
had
done
exactly
what
she
pleased
lived
only
for
her
own
pleasure
now
she
would
do
as
dictated
for
a
like
time
live
your
way
i
never
was
farther
from
a
mistake
in
my
life
if
you
think
it
does
take
courage
to
tell
you
this
and
if
you
think
i
enjoy
it
and
if
you
think
i
do
wish
i
were
a
mile
away
i
still
maintain
i
know
the
lady
better
than
you
do
said
minturn
but
you
are
wonderful
leslie
and
i
always
shall
respect
and
honour
you
for
your
effort
in
our
behalf
it
does
credit
to
your
head
and
heart
i
envy
douglas
bruce
if
ever
an
hour
of
trial
comes
to
you
i
would
feel
honoured
for
a
chance
to
prove
to
you
how
much
i
appreciate
do
talk
like
that
wailed
leslie
it
all
a
failure
if
you
do
promise
me
that
you
will
this
let
me
send
you
the
note
nellie
wrote
me
before
she
went
away
wo
you
try
to
imagine
what
she
is
suffering
in
the
change
from
what
she
went
to
you
hoping
and
what
she
received
at
your
hands
let
me
see
said
james
minturn
at
this
hour
she
is
probably
enduring
the
pangs
of
wearing
the
most
tasteful
afternoon
gown
on
the
veranda
of
whatever
summer
resort
suits
her
variable
fancy
also
the
discomfiture
of
the
woman
she
induced
to
bid
high
and
is
now
winning
from
at
bridge
i
am
particularly
intimate
with
her
forms
of
suffering
you
see
i
judge
them
by
my
own
and
my
children
during
the
past
years
then
you
think
i
not
sincere
asked
leslie
surely
my
dear
girl
said
minturn
with
all
my
heart
i
believe
you
i
know
you
are
loyal
to
her
and
to
me
it
is
i
disbelieve
child
it
is
my
wife
but
i
told
you
over
and
over
that
she
changed
and
i
refuse
to
believe
in
her
power
to
undergo
the
genuine
and
permanent
change
that
would
make
her
an
influence
for
good
with
her
sons
or
anything
but
an
uncontrollable
element
in
my
home
said
minturn
why
leslie
if
i
were
to
hunt
her
up
and
ask
her
to
come
to
my
house
do
you
think
she
would
do
it
i
know
she
would
be
most
happy
said
leslie
small
plain
rooms
wait
on
herself
children
over
the
house
and
lawn
at
all
times
nellie
minturn
you
amuse
me
he
said
there
no
amusement
in
it
for
me
it
is
pitiful
tragedy
said
leslie
she
is
willing
she
has
offered
to
change
you
are
denying
her
the
opportunity
you
do
think
deeply
enough
said
the
man
suppose
knowing
her
as
i
do
i
agreed
to
her
coming
to
my
house
suppose
i
filled
it
with
servants
to
wait
on
her
and
ruin
and
make
snobs
of
the
boys
it
could
only
result
in
a
fiasco
all
around
and
bring
me
again
to
the
awful
thing
i
have
been
through
once
in
forcing
a
separation
the
present
is
too
good
for
the
boys
and
now
they
are
my
first
consideration
so
i
see
said
leslie
nellie
is
getting
a
particle
and
she
their
mother
and
once
she
really
awakened
to
the
situation
she
was
hungry
to
mother
them
and
to
take
her
place
in
their
hearts
i
know
where
she
is
but
feeling
as
she
did
when
we
parted
i
know
not
at
any
summer
resort
playing
bridge
at
this
minute
you
are
a
friend
worth
having
leslie
i
congratulate
my
wife
on
so
staunch
an
advocate
said
james
minturn
and
i
promise
you
this
i
go
back
to
the
hateful
subject
just
when
i
felt
i
was
free
from
it
i
think
on
both
sides
and
i
weigh
all
you
said
if
i
see
a
glimmering
i
will
do
this
much
i
will
locate
her
and
learn
how
genuine
was
the
change
you
witnessed
and
i
rather
think
i
manage
for
you
to
see
also
will
that
satisfy
you
that
will
make
me
radiant
because
the
change
i
witnessed
was
genuine
i
know
that
wherever
nellie
is
and
whatever
she
is
doing
she
is
still
firm
as
when
she
left
me
in
her
desire
for
reparation
toward
you
and
her
sons
please
think
fast
and
find
her
quickly
leslie
you
incorrigible
go
bring
douglas
to
his
surprise
he
has
a
right
to
be
happy
so
have
you
insisted
leslie
more
than
he
because
you
have
had
such
deep
sorrow
then
leslie
took
leave
of
the
others
returned
to
the
cabin
and
hurried
to
her
room
to
dress
for
her
trip
to
bring
her
lover
douglas
bruce
was
waiting
when
she
stopped
at
the
iriquois
and
his
greeting
was
joyous
winton
was
cordial
but
douglas
noticed
that
he
seemed
tired
and
worried
and
inquired
if
he
were
working
unusually
hard
he
replied
that
he
was
and
beginning
to
feel
the
heat
a
little
then
we
will
drive
to
the
country
before
dinner
to
cool
off
said
leslie
seeing
her
opportunity
both
men
agreed
that
would
be
enjoyable
after
a
few
minutes
of
casual
talk
they
relaxed
while
making
smooth
passage
over
city
streets
and
the
almost
equally
level
highways
of
the
country
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
douglas
sat
upright
looking
around
him
i
do
recognize
this
he
said
have
we
been
here
before
leslie
i
think
not
she
answered
i
do
know
why
it
is
one
of
my
best
loved
drives
always
before
we
have
taken
the
road
to
the
club
house
or
some
of
its
branches
they
began
a
gentle
ascent
when
directly
across
their
way
stretched
the
blue
water
of
a
lake
is
here
where
we
take
the
plunge
inquired
douglas
no
indeed
answered
leslie
here
we
speed
until
we
gather
such
momentum
that
we
shoot
across
the
water
and
alight
on
the
opposite
bank
without
stopping
make
your
landing
neatly
rogers
why
have
we
never
been
here
before
marvelled
douglas
i
remember
any
other
road
so
inviting
just
look
ahead
here
see
what
a
beautiful
picture
he
indicated
a
vine
of
creeping
blackberry
spreading
over
gold
sand
its
rough
deeply
serrated
leaves
of
most
artistic
cutting
with
tufts
of
snowy
bloom
surrounding
stamens
in
their
centres
is
it
answered
winton
you
know
what
whitman
said
of
it
i
not
so
well
read
in
whitman
as
you
are
which
is
your
distinct
loss
said
winton
it
was
he
who
wrote
running
blackberry
would
adorn
the
parlours
of
heaven
and
so
it
would
exclaimed
douglas
what
a
frieze
that
would
make
for
a
have
you
ever
seen
it
used
never
answered
leslie
or
many
other
of
our
most
exquisite
forms
of
wild
growth
what
beautiful
country
douglas
commented
a
minute
later
as
the
car
sped
from
the
swamp
ran
uphill
and
down
a
valley
between
stretches
of
tilled
farm
land
on
either
side
sloping
back
to
the
lakes
now
growing
distant
then
creeping
up
a
gradual
incline
until
atwater
flashed
into
sight
man
that
fine
he
said
rising
in
the
car
to
better
admire
the
view
at
which
leslie
signalled
the
driver
to
run
slower
i
remember
that
i
ever
saw
anything
quite
so
attractive
as
this
and
if
ever
water
invited
a
swimmer
that
white
sand
bed
seems
to
extend
as
far
into
the
lake
as
you
can
see
jove
was
that
a
black
bass
under
that
thorn
bush
leslie
eyes
were
shining
while
her
laugh
was
as
joyous
as
any
of
the
birds
he
need
not
say
more
there
was
a
bathing
suit
in
his
room
in
ten
minutes
he
could
be
cleaving
the
water
to
the
opposite
shore
and
have
time
to
return
before
dinner
the
car
sped
down
where
the
road
ran
level
with
the
water
a
flock
of
waders
arose
and
circled
the
lake
on
the
right
was
the
orchard
the
newly
made
garden
the
tiny
cabin
with
green
lawn
hammocks
swinging
between
trees
indian
blankets
spread
and
the
odour
of
cooking
food
in
the
air
the
car
stopped
douglas
sprang
out
and
offered
his
hand
as
he
saw
leslie
intended
descending
she
took
the
hand
and
kept
it
in
her
left
with
her
right
she
included
woods
water
orchard
and
cabin
these
are
my
surprise
for
you
she
said
i
am
going
to
live
here
this
summer
and
keep
house
for
you
and
dad
while
you
run
and
reform
the
world
welcome
home
douglas
he
slowly
looked
around
then
at
winton
do
you
believe
her
he
asked
incredulously
yes
indeed
leslie
has
the
faculty
of
making
good
and
i
one
day
ahead
of
you
she
tried
this
on
me
last
night
hurry
into
your
bathing
suit
we
swim
before
dinner
and
then
we
fish
it
was
great
going
in
this
morning
i
sure
you
enjoy
it
enjoy
it
cried
douglas
here
is
where
the
paucity
of
our
language
is
made
manifest
too
happy
herself
for
the
right
word
leslie
showed
douglas
to
his
room
with
its
white
bed
and
row
of
hooks
on
one
of
which
hung
the
bathing
suit
then
she
went
to
put
on
her
own
and
they
hurried
to
the
lake
you
are
happy
here
leslie
asked
douglas
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
so
happy
as
i
am
this
moment
said
leslie
skifting
the
clear
water
with
her
hands
while
she
waited
for
her
father
before
starting
the
swim
to
the
opposite
shore
i
got
the
most
joyous
thing
to
tell
you
go
on
and
tell
of
morning
he
said
i
am
so
delighted
maudlin
right
over
there
on
the
road
to
the
club
house
while
new
worlds
to
conquer
this
afternoon
i
ran
into
james
minturn
wearing
a
bathing
suit
to
his
knees
in
mud
and
water
building
a
sod
dam
for
his
boys
you
did
cried
douglas
i
did
said
leslie
here
the
picture
a
beautiful
winding
stream
big
trees
like
these
on
the
banks
shade
and
flowers
birds
and
air
a
fine
appearing
woman
he
introduced
as
his
sister
a
minturn
boy
catching
fish
with
his
bare
hands
on
either
bank
the
brother
minturn
must
have
adopted
legally
since
he
gave
him
his
name
he
did
interrupted
douglas
he
told
me
so
i
was
sure
of
it
said
leslie
and
an
interesting
young
man
a
tutor
bringing
up
more
sod
the
boys
acted
quite
like
any
other
agreeably
engaged
children
but
minturn
himself
looking
like
a
man
i
never
saw
before
down
in
the
sand
and
water
building
a
sod
dam
a
sod
dam
i
telling
you
i
notice
what
you
are
telling
me
cried
douglas
it
is
duly
impressing
me
is
all
i
can
think
of
it
no
wonder
exclaimed
leslie
what
did
he
say
to
you
queried
douglas
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
say
anything
said
leslie
i
could
see
he
is
making
over
his
boys
and
in
order
to
do
it
sympathetically
and
win
their
confidence
and
love
he
is
being
a
boy
himself
again
he
has
the
little
chaps
under
control
now
there
are
love
and
admiration
in
their
tones
when
they
speak
to
him
while
they
him
think
of
it
it
is
something
worth
thinking
of
said
douglas
he
was
driven
to
action
but
his
methods
must
have
been
heroic
for
they
seem
to
have
worked
yes
for
him
and
the
boys
said
leslie
but
they
are
not
all
his
family
the
remainder
of
his
family
always
has
looked
out
for
herself
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
in
life
you
have
told
me
i
imagine
she
is
still
doing
it
with
wonderful
success
hazarded
douglas
it
amazes
me
how
men
can
be
so
unfeeling
so
you
talked
to
him
about
her
i
surely
did
asserted
leslie
and
i
wager
you
wasted
words
said
douglas
not
one
cried
the
girl
he
will
remember
each
one
i
spoke
if
i
do
hear
of
him
taking
some
action
soon
i
find
another
occasion
and
try
again
he
shall
divide
the
joy
of
remaking
those
boys
with
their
mother
she
will
respectfully
i
mean
disdainfully
decline
you
do
believe
she
was
in
earnest
in
what
she
said
to
me
then
asked
the
girl
i
am
quite
sure
she
was
he
answered
but
a
few
days
of
her
former
life
with
her
old
friends
will
take
her
back
to
her
previous
ways
with
greater
abandon
than
ever
you
mark
my
words
bother
your
words
cried
leslie
emphatically
i
tell
you
douglas
i
went
through
the
fire
with
her
i
watched
her
soul
come
out
white
promise
me
that
if
ever
he
talks
to
you
you
wo
say
anything
against
her
it
would
be
a
temptation
he
said
minturn
is
a
different
man
so
is
she
a
different
woman
come
on
dad
we
are
waiting
for
you
called
leslie
what
kept
you
so
a
paper
fell
from
my
pocket
so
i
picked
it
up
and
in
glancing
at
it
i
became
interested
in
a
thought
that
had
occurred
to
me
before
and
i
forgot
you
must
forgive
your
old
daddy
his
hands
are
about
full
these
days
between
my
job
for
the
city
and
my
own
affairs
and
those
of
a
friend
i
have
all
i
can
carry
now
let
me
forget
business
i
call
this
great
of
the
girl
and
one
of
the
biggest
appeals
to
me
is
the
bill
of
fare
i
had
a
dinner
for
a
king
last
night
what
have
we
but
wo
anticipation
spoil
it
she
asked
not
a
particle
he
declared
it
the
fish
we
caught
last
night
baked
potatoes
cress
salad
from
minturn
brook
strawberries
from
atwaters
cream
from
our
rented
cow
real
clover
cream
james
says
and
biscuit
that
all
glory
cried
winton
does
that
thrill
you
let
head
for
the
tallest
tamarack
of
the
swamp
and
then
have
a
feast
on
the
opposite
bank
they
rested
a
few
minutes
then
returned
to
dinner
afterward
with
rogers
rowing
for
winton
and
leslie
for
douglas
they
went
bass
fishing
when
the
boats
passed
on
the
far
shore
leslie
and
douglas
had
three
and
winton
five
this
did
not
prove
that
he
was
the
better
fisherman
only
that
he
worked
constantly
they
lost
much
time
in
conversation
which
interested
them
but
as
they
enjoyed
what
they
had
to
say
more
than
the
sport
while
leslie
only
wished
them
to
take
the
fish
they
would
use
it
was
their
affair
the
girl
soon
returned
to
the
minturns
and
secured
a
promise
from
douglas
that
if
minturn
talked
with
him
at
least
he
would
say
nothing
to
discourage
his
friend
about
the
sincerity
of
his
wife
motives
leslie
thoughts
then
turned
to
the
surprise
douglas
had
mentioned
oh
that
pretty
girl
he
inquired
casually
yes
lily
she
said
of
course
mickey
took
you
to
see
her
is
she
really
a
lovable
child
and
attractive
could
you
get
any
idea
of
what
is
her
trouble
douglas
carefully
reeled
while
looking
at
leslie
with
a
speculative
smile
you
refuse
to
consider
an
attractive
young
lady
of
greater
beauty
than
i
have
previously
seen
he
queried
absolutely
do
waste
time
on
it
she
said
you
have
to
begin
again
and
ask
me
one
at
a
time
he
laughed
what
was
your
first
is
she
really
a
lovable
child
repeated
leslie
she
most
certainly
is
said
douglas
i
could
love
her
dearly
plain
that
mickey
adores
her
why
when
a
boy
gives
up
trips
to
the
country
the
chance
to
pick
up
good
money
in
order
to
stand
over
wash
and
cook
for
a
little
sick
girl
what
is
the
answer
the
one
you
have
given
that
he
adores
her
conceded
leslie
the
next
was
she
attractive
wonderfully
cried
douglas
and
what
she
would
be
in
health
with
flesh
to
cover
her
bones
and
colour
on
her
lips
and
cheeks
is
now
only
dimly
foreshadowed
she
must
have
her
chance
said
leslie
i
was
thinking
of
her
i
go
to
see
her
at
once
and
bring
her
here
i
will
get
the
best
surgeon
in
multiopolis
to
examine
her
and
a
nurse
if
need
be
then
mickey
can
come
out
with
you
would
you
really
leslie
asked
douglas
but
why
not
cried
she
that
one
of
the
things
worth
while
in
the
world
i
love
to
go
halvers
with
you
proposed
douglas
let
do
it
when
will
you
go
to
see
her
in
a
few
days
said
leslie
the
last
one
was
you
get
any
idea
of
what
is
the
trouble
very
little
said
douglas
she
can
sit
up
and
move
her
hands
he
is
teaching
her
to
read
and
write
she
had
her
lesson
very
creditably
copied
out
on
her
slate
she
practises
in
his
absence
on
poems
mickey
makes
poems
doggerel
explained
douglas
four
lines
at
a
time
some
of
it
is
pathetic
some
of
it
is
witty
some
of
it
presages
possibilities
he
may
make
a
poet
she
requires
a
verse
each
evening
so
he
recites
it
then
writes
it
out
and
she
uses
it
for
copy
the
next
day
the
finished
product
is
to
have
a
cover
and
be
decorated
either
with
an
english
sparrow
the
only
bird
she
has
seen
or
a
cow
she
likes
milk
and
the
pictures
of
cows
give
her
an
idea
that
she
can
handle
them
like
her
doll
oh
douglas
protested
leslie
i
believe
she
thinks
a
whole
herd
of
cows
could
be
kept
on
her
bed
while
she
finds
them
quite
suitable
to
decorate
mickey
volume
said
douglas
why
has
she
seen
anything
at
all
she
has
been
on
the
street
twice
in
her
life
that
she
knows
of
answered
douglas
it
will
be
kind
of
you
to
take
her
and
cure
her
if
it
can
be
done
but
you
have
to
consult
mickey
she
is
his
find
so
he
claims
her
belligerently
i
might
warn
you
claims
her
has
her
marvelled
leslie
surely
in
his
room
on
his
bed
taking
care
of
her
himself
and
doing
a
mighty
fine
job
of
it
best
she
ever
had
i
am
quite
sure
said
douglas
but
douglas
cried
leslie
in
amazement
me
no
buts
my
lady
warned
douglas
i
know
what
you
would
say
save
it
you
ca
do
anything
that
way
mickey
is
right
she
his
he
found
her
in
her
last
extremity
in
rags
on
the
floor
in
a
dark
corner
of
an
attic
he
carried
her
home
in
that
condition
to
a
clean
bed
his
mother
left
him
since
he
has
been
her
gallant
little
knight
lying
on
the
floor
on
his
winter
bedding
feeding
her
first
and
most
not
a
thought
for
himself
god
leslie
i
do
stand
for
anything
coming
between
mickey
and
his
child
his
he
calls
her
he
the
biggest
small
specimen
i
ever
have
seen
i
fight
his
cause
in
any
court
in
the
country
if
his
right
to
her
is
questioned
as
it
will
be
the
minute
she
is
taken
to
a
surgeon
or
a
hospital
how
old
is
she
asked
leslie
neither
of
them
knows
about
ten
i
should
think
how
has
he
managed
to
keep
her
hidden
this
long
he
lives
in
an
attic
the
first
woman
he
tried
to
get
help
from
started
the
home
question
and
frightened
him
so
he
appealed
to
a
nurse
he
met
through
being
connected
with
an
accident
she
gave
him
supplies
instructions
and
made
lily
gowns
but
why
did
she
began
leslie
she
may
have
thought
the
child
was
his
sister
said
douglas
the
loveliest
little
thing
leslie
very
little
asked
leslie
tiny
is
the
word
said
douglas
it
the
prettiest
sight
i
ever
saw
to
watch
him
wait
on
her
and
to
see
her
big
starved
scared
eyes
follow
him
with
adoring
trust
adoration
on
both
sides
then
laughed
leslie
you
imply
i
selecting
too
big
words
said
douglas
wait
till
you
see
her
and
see
them
together
it
a
problem
said
leslie
yes
i
admit
that
conceded
douglas
but
it
is
problem
but
they
ca
go
on
that
way
cried
leslie
i
grant
that
said
douglas
all
i
stipulate
is
that
mickey
shall
be
left
to
plan
their
lives
himself
and
in
a
way
that
makes
him
happy
that
only
fair
to
him
said
leslie
now
you
are
grasping
and
assimilating
the
situation
properly
commented
douglas
when
they
returned
to
the
cabin
they
found
winton
stretched
in
a
hammock
smoking
douglas
took
a
blanket
and
leslie
a
cushion
on
the
steps
while
all
of
them
watched
the
moon
pass
slowly
across
atwater
how
are
you
progressing
with
the
sinners
of
multiopolis
asked
winton
of
douglas
fine
he
answered
i
found
what
i
think
will
turn
out
to
be
a
big
defalcation
somebody
drops
out
in
disgrace
with
probably
a
penitentiary
sentence
oh
douglas
how
can
you
cried
leslie
how
can
a
man
live
in
luxury
when
he
is
stealing
other
people
money
to
pay
the
bills
he
retorted
yes
i
know
but
douglas
i
wish
you
would
buy
this
place
and
plow
corn
or
fish
for
a
living
sometimes
i
have
an
inkling
that
before
i
finish
with
this
i
shall
wish
so
too
replied
he
what
do
you
think
daddy
asked
leslie
i
think
the
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
and
that
as
always
he
pays
in
the
end
go
ahead
son
but
let
me
know
before
you
reach
my
office
or
any
of
my
men
i
hope
i
have
my
department
in
perfect
order
but
sometimes
a
man
gets
a
surprise
of
course
agreed
douglas
look
at
that
water
will
you
just
beyond
that
ragged
old
sycamore
that
fellow
must
have
been
a
whale
this
great
the
best
of
life
said
winton
stooping
to
kiss
leslie
as
he
said
to
both
chapter
xiii
safe
when
mickey
posted
his
letter
in
deep
thought
he
slowly
walked
home
that
night
his
eyes
closed
with
a
feeling
of
relief
he
was
certain
that
when
peter
and
his
wife
and
children
talked
over
the
plan
he
had
suggested
they
would
be
anxious
to
have
such
a
nice
girl
as
lily
in
their
home
for
a
week
he
even
went
so
far
as
the
vague
thought
that
if
they
kept
her
until
fall
they
never
would
be
able
to
give
her
up
and
possibly
she
could
remain
with
them
until
he
could
learn
whether
her
back
could
be
cured
and
make
arrangements
suitable
for
her
in
his
heart
he
felt
sure
that
bruce
or
miss
leslie
would
help
him
take
care
of
her
but
he
had
strong
objections
to
them
he
thought
the
country
with
its
clean
air
birds
flowers
and
quiet
the
best
place
for
her
if
he
allowed
them
to
take
her
she
would
be
among
luxuries
which
would
make
all
he
could
do
unappreciated
she
was
born
to
things
like
that
what
the
use
to
spoil
her
with
them
he
argued
course
they
have
spoiled
miss
leslie
but
she
was
a
poor
kid
to
start
on
and
she
has
a
father
to
take
care
of
her
and
bruce
lily
has
only
me
and
i
going
to
manage
my
family
myself
pretty
soon
those
nice
folks
will
come
and
if
she
likes
them
maybe
i
let
them
take
her
it
cooler
mickey
had
thought
they
would
come
soon
but
he
had
not
supposed
it
would
be
the
following
day
he
went
downtown
early
spent
some
time
drilling
his
protégé
in
the
paper
business
and
had
the
office
ready
when
douglas
bruce
arrived
an
hour
late
during
that
hour
call
came
he
made
an
appointment
to
meet
and
peter
harding
at
marsh
jordan
at
four
peter
must
have
wanted
to
see
her
so
bad
he
quit
plowing
to
come
commented
mickey
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
he
could
have
finished
that
field
last
night
they
just
crazy
to
see
lily
and
when
they
do
they
be
worse
yet
but
of
course
they
would
want
to
take
her
from
me
they
got
three
of
their
own
i
guess
peter
is
the
safest
proposition
i
know
course
he
would
ever
put
a
little
in
any
old
orphings
home
sure
he
would
he
put
his
own
there
course
he
would
mine
mickey
what
do
you
think
asked
douglas
as
he
entered
i
moved
to
the
country
mickey
stared
then
came
his
slow
comment
gee
the
cows
an
the
clover
gets
all
of
us
i
can
beat
that
said
douglas
i
going
to
live
beside
a
lake
where
i
can
swim
every
night
and
morning
and
catch
big
bass
and
live
on
strawberries
from
the
vines
and
cream
straight
from
the
cow
i
thought
you
get
to
the
cow
before
long
and
you
are
invited
to
go
out
with
me
as
often
as
you
want
to
and
you
may
arrange
to
have
lily
out
too
wo
that
be
fine
mickey
hesitated
while
his
eyes
grew
speculative
before
he
answered
with
his
ever
ready
sure
miss
winton
made
a
plan
for
her
father
and
me
explained
douglas
she
knew
we
would
lose
our
vacations
this
summer
so
she
took
an
old
cabin
on
atwater
and
moved
out
we
are
to
go
back
and
forth
each
morning
and
evening
i
never
was
at
the
lake
before
but
it
not
far
from
the
club
house
and
it
beautiful
i
think
most
of
all
i
shall
enjoy
the
swimming
and
fishing
i
have
had
experience
with
water
enough
to
swim
in
said
mickey
a
tub
has
been
my
limit
you
have
a
fine
time
all
right
and
thank
you
for
asking
me
i
think
miss
winton
is
great
ai
it
funny
how
many
fine
folks
there
are
in
the
world
every
one
i
meet
is
too
nice
for
any
use
but
i
do
know
any
swell
dames
my
people
are
just
common
folks
you
would
call
miss
winton
a
dame
then
well
i
should
say
nix
cried
mickey
you
would
catch
her
motoring
away
to
a
party
and
leaving
her
baby
to
be
slapped
and
shook
out
of
its
breath
by
a
mad
nurselady
she
left
it
herself
where
the
sun
hurt
its
eyes
she
would
put
a
little
girl
that
could
walk
in
any
orphings
home
where
no
telling
what
might
happen
to
her
she
fix
her
a
precious
child
and
take
her
for
a
ride
in
her
car
and
be
careful
with
her
are
you
quite
sure
about
that
mickey
surest
thing
you
know
said
mickey
emphatically
why
look
her
straight
in
the
eyes
and
you
can
tell
i
saw
her
coming
away
down
the
street
and
the
minute
i
got
my
peepers
on
her
i
picked
her
for
a
winner
i
guess
you
did
too
i
certainly
did
said
douglas
but
it
is
most
important
that
i
be
perfectly
sure
so
i
should
like
to
have
your
approval
of
my
choice
i
guess
you
kidding
now
ventured
mickey
no
i
in
earnest
said
douglas
bruce
you
see
mickey
as
i
have
said
before
your
education
and
mine
have
been
different
but
yours
is
equally
valuable
what
shall
i
do
now
me
i
mean
what
do
i
mean
asked
mickey
to
wait
until
i
ready
for
you
suggested
douglas
sure
conceded
mickey
it
because
i
used
to
hopping
so
lively
on
the
streets
do
you
miss
the
streets
inquired
douglas
well
not
so
much
as
i
thought
i
would
said
mickey
in
a
way
i
still
on
the
job
but
i
guess
i
get
henry
boy
so
he
can
go
it
all
right
he
seems
to
be
doing
fairly
well
so
does
the
old
man
have
you
got
him
in
training
too
asked
douglas
oh
it
his
mug
explained
mickey
impatiently
you
do
own
a
grouch
what
the
use
of
displaying
it
in
your
show
window
those
things
are
dangerous
they
contagious
seeing
a
fellow
on
the
street
looking
like
he
never
smile
again
makes
other
folks
think
of
their
woes
so
pretty
soon
everybody
gets
sorry
for
themselves
i
like
to
see
the
whole
world
happy
mickey
what
makes
so
happy
i
scent
somepin
nice
in
the
air
said
mickey
i
hear
the
rumble
of
the
joy
wagon
coming
my
way
you
surely
look
it
declared
douglas
it
a
mighty
fine
thing
to
be
happy
i
am
especially
thinking
that
because
it
looks
like
this
last
batch
you
brought
me
has
a
bad
dose
in
it
for
a
man
i
know
he
wo
be
happy
when
he
sees
his
name
in
letters
an
inch
high
on
the
front
page
of
the
no
he
wo
agreed
mickey
his
face
dulling
that
in
my
i
seen
men
forced
to
take
it
right
on
the
cars
open
a
paper
slide
down
turn
white
shiver
then
take
a
brace
and
try
to
sit
up
and
look
like
they
did
care
when
you
could
see
it
was
all
up
with
them
gee
it
tough
i
wish
we
were
in
other
business
but
what
about
the
men
who
work
hard
for
their
money
not
to
mince
matters
that
these
men
you
are
pitying
steal
asked
douglas
yes
i
know
said
mickey
but
there
a
big
bunch
of
taxpayers
so
it
does
hit
any
so
hard
it
tough
on
them
but
honest
bruce
it
ai
as
tough
to
lose
your
coin
as
it
is
to
lose
your
glad
face
you
can
earn
more
money
or
slide
along
without
so
much
but
once
you
get
the
slick
shamed
look
on
your
show
window
you
ca
ever
wash
it
off
since
your
face
is
what
your
friends
know
you
by
it
an
awful
pity
to
spoil
it
that
so
too
mickey
laughed
bruce
but
keep
this
clearly
in
your
mind
not
spoiling
any
one
if
any
man
loses
his
right
to
look
his
neighbour
frankly
in
the
eye
from
the
job
we
on
it
is
fault
not
if
men
have
lived
straight
we
ca
find
defalcations
in
their
books
can
we
nope
agreed
mickey
just
the
same
i
wish
we
were
plowing
corn
of
looking
for
them
that
plowing
job
is
awful
nice
i
watched
a
man
the
other
day
the
grandest
big
bunch
of
bone
and
muscle
driving
a
team
it
took
a
gladiator
to
handle
first
time
i
ever
saw
it
done
at
close
range
and
it
got
me
he
looked
like
a
man
you
want
to
tie
to
and
stick
the
war
is
over
if
he
ever
has
a
case
he
is
going
to
bring
it
to
you
but
where
he
get
a
case
out
there
ten
miles
from
anybody
with
the
bluest
sky
you
ever
saw
over
his
head
and
black
fields
under
his
feet
i
ca
see
yes
i
wish
we
were
plowing
for
corn
of
trouble
you
little
dunce
laughed
douglas
we
make
a
fortune
plowing
corn
what
the
difference
how
much
you
make
if
something
black
keeps
at
your
heels
how
you
make
it
asked
mickey
there
a
good
strong
kick
in
my
heels
and
the
is
for
the
feet
of
the
man
i
after
yes
i
know
said
mickey
but
we
get
through
with
this
i
just
got
a
hunch
that
you
wish
we
had
been
plowing
corn
too
what
makes
you
so
sure
mickey
said
douglas
oh
things
i
hear
men
say
when
i
get
the
books
keep
me
thinking
replied
mickey
what
things
queried
douglas
oh
about
who
going
to
get
the
axe
next
said
mickey
but
what
of
that
asked
douglas
why
it
might
be
somebody
you
know
he
cried
when
you
find
these
wrong
entries
you
ca
tell
who
made
them
i
know
that
the
man
who
made
them
deserves
what
he
gets
said
douglas
yes
i
guess
he
does
agreed
mickey
well
go
on
but
when
i
grow
up
i
going
to
plow
corn
what
about
the
poetry
queried
douglas
they
go
together
fine
explained
mickey
when
the
book
is
finished
i
like
clover
on
the
cover
better
than
the
cow
but
if
lily
wants
the
live
stock
it
goes
of
course
assented
douglas
but
when
she
sees
a
real
cow
she
may
change
her
mind
right
in
style
ladies
do
it
often
conceded
mickey
i
seen
them
so
changeful
they
could
tell
when
they
called
a
taxi
where
they
wanted
to
be
taken
mickey
your
observations
on
human
nature
would
make
a
better
book
than
your
poetry
oh
i
do
know
said
mickey
you
see
i
ai
really
got
the
poetry
job
yet
i
have
to
be
educated
a
lot
to
do
it
right
what
i
do
now
i
would
show
to
anybody
else
it
just
fooling
for
lily
but
i
got
an
address
that
gives
me
a
on
the
paper
business
if
i
ever
want
it
i
ai
got
at
the
poetry
yet
but
i
been
on
the
job
from
the
start
when
you
go
cold
and
hungry
if
you
do
know
human
nature
why
you
it
that
all
you
surely
do
said
douglas
now
let
hustle
this
forenoon
and
then
you
may
have
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
am
going
fishing
thank
you
said
mickey
i
hope
you
get
a
bass
as
long
as
your
arm
and
i
hope
the
man
you
are
chasing
breaks
his
neck
before
you
get
him
mickey
grinned
at
douglas
laugh
and
went
racing
about
his
work
then
he
helped
on
his
paper
route
until
four
when
he
hurried
to
his
meeting
with
nancy
and
peter
when
everybody
is
so
nice
if
you
give
them
any
show
at
all
i
understand
where
the
grouchers
get
their
grouch
muttered
mickey
as
he
hopped
from
one
toe
to
the
other
and
tried
to
select
the
car
at
the
curb
which
would
be
peter
hey
you
presently
called
a
voice
from
one
of
them
mickey
sent
a
keen
glance
over
a
boy
who
had
come
up
and
entered
the
car
straw
you
retorted
mickey
landing
on
the
curb
in
a
flying
leap
is
your
name
mickey
inquired
the
boy
yep
is
your
father
name
peter
asked
mickey
yep
and
mine
is
peter
too
so
to
avoid
two
peters
i
am
junior
come
on
in
the
folks
come
formalities
were
over
mickey
laughed
as
he
entered
the
car
and
straightway
began
an
investigation
of
its
machinery
now
any
boy
is
proud
to
teach
another
something
he
wants
to
know
and
does
not
so
by
the
time
the
car
was
thoroughly
explained
any
listener
would
have
thought
them
acquaintances
from
birth
hurry
cried
junior
when
his
parents
came
i
want
to
get
home
with
mickey
i
want
him
to
show
me
do
you
hurry
your
folks
junior
said
mickey
i
show
you
all
right
well
it
about
time
i
was
seeing
something
sure
it
is
agreed
mickey
come
on
with
me
here
and
i
show
you
what
real
boys
are
say
father
i
coming
you
know
cried
junior
i
tired
poking
in
the
country
just
look
what
being
in
the
city
has
made
of
mickey
yes
just
look
cried
mickey
waving
both
hands
and
bracing
on
feet
wide
apart
do
look
your
age
or
more
and
about
your
beefsteak
and
bone
but
you
got
muscle
i
bet
i
could
throw
you
i
bet
you
could
either
retorted
mickey
i
survived
multiopolis
by
being
johnny
on
the
spot
i
dodged
for
my
life
and
my
living
since
i
can
remember
i
champeen
on
that
but
you
come
on
with
me
and
i
get
you
a
job
and
let
you
try
yourself
i
coming
said
junior
then
remembering
he
was
not
independent
he
turned
to
his
mother
ca
i
take
a
job
and
work
here
harding
braced
herself
and
succumbed
to
habit
that
will
be
as
your
father
says
junior
turned
toward
his
father
doubt
in
his
eye
to
receive
a
shock
there
was
not
a
trace
of
surprise
or
disapproval
on
the
face
of
peter
now
maybe
that
would
be
the
best
way
in
the
world
for
you
to
help
me
out
he
said
you
see
me
through
planting
and
harvest
and
then
arrange
to
spare
you
and
you
can
see
how
you
like
it
till
fall
but
you
are
too
young
to
give
up
school
and
i
do
agree
to
interrupting
your
education
harding
entered
the
car
now
mickey
she
said
as
she
distributed
parcels
you
sit
up
there
with
peter
and
show
him
the
way
and
we
will
go
see
if
we
want
to
undertake
the
care
of
your
little
girl
for
a
week
drop
the
anchor
furl
the
sail
right
here
directed
mickey
when
they
reached
sunrise
alley
you
know
i
told
you
dearest
lady
about
how
scared
my
little
girl
is
having
seen
so
few
folks
and
not
expecting
you
so
i
have
to
ask
you
to
wait
a
few
minutes
i
go
up
and
get
her
used
to
your
being
here
and
then
i
have
to
sort
of
work
her
up
to
you
one
at
a
time
i
you
ca
hardly
believe
that
anything
in
all
the
world
so
small
and
so
white
that
lived
to
have
the
brains
she
has
and
yet
has
seen
the
streets
of
this
city
but
for
a
short
ride
on
a
twice
in
her
life
and
has
talked
to
half
a
dozen
people
she
may
take
you
for
a
bear
peter
you
will
be
quiet
and
easy
wo
you
why
mickey
said
peter
why
of
course
son
mickey
bounded
up
the
stairs
and
swung
wide
his
door
again
the
awful
heat
hit
him
in
the
face
he
swallowed
a
mouthful
hastily
shutting
the
door
it
hard
on
lily
was
his
mental
comment
but
i
guess
just
that
for
and
peter
i
think
a
few
gulps
of
it
will
do
them
good
it
will
show
them
better
than
talking
why
once
of
it
she
should
come
back
cold
weather
at
least
if
at
all
yes
i
guess
most
baked
honey
he
asked

her
hot
hands

hours

mickey

announced
peaches
well
if
i
ever

mickey

a
great
big
man
twice
as
big
as
bruce
you

either

up
to

and
not
let

all
if
you

peter
you
want
to

the
nice
lady

do
you
lily
yes

i

see
the
cow
but

said
lily
i

i

peter
the
now
you
look

miss
chicken
do

a
tantrum
cried
mickey
if
you

this
nice
lady
first
and
be
pretty
to
her
i
just
go
down
and
tell
them
you
lying
here
roasting
and
they
can
go
back
to
their
and
berries
see
peaches
drew
a
deep
breath
but
her
eyes
were
wilful
a
wave
of
heat
seemed
to
envelop
them
sweat
it
out
right
now
ordered
mickey
when
people
do
things
for
you
they
are
sorry
for
you
it
up
to
you
to
be
polite
to
pay
back
with
manners
at
least
see
peaches
smile
was
irresistible
mickey
i
feel
so
i
see
the
nice
lady
first
now
there
a
real
lady
mickey
stooped
to
kiss
peaches
again
take
a
last
look
at
the
hair
ribbon
and
straighten
the
sheet
then
he
ran
but
he
closed
in
the
heat
quickly
as
he
slipped
through
the
doorway
a
few
seconds
later
with
the
harding
family
at
his
heels
he
again
approached
it
there
he
made
his
second
speech
he
addressed
it
to
peter
and
junior
she
so
little
and
so
scared
i
guess
the
nice
lady
better
go
in
first
and
make
up
with
her
then
one
at
a
time
you
can
come
so
so
many
strangers
wo
upset
her
peter
assented
heartily
but
with
a
suffocating
gesture
removed
his
coat
so
junior
followed
his
example
mickey
cut
short
something
about
extreme
heat
on
the
lips
of
harding
by
indicating
the
door
and
opening
it
he
quickly
closed
it
after
her
advancing
to
peaches
lily
this
is
the
nice
lady
i
was
telling
you
of
who
has
got
the
bird
singing
and
the
he
began
peaches
drew
back
her
eyes
wide
with
wonder
and
excitement
but
her
mind
followed
lead
for
she
shocked
his
sense
of
propriety
by
adding
and
the
good
red
berries
but
harding
came
from
an
environment
where
to
have
good
red
berries
spicy
smoked
ham
fat
chickens
and
golden
loaves
constituted
a
first
test
of
efficiency
to
have
her
red
berries
appreciated
did
not
offend
her
if
peaches
had
said
the
sweetest
biggest
red
berries
in
noble
country
the
woman
would
have
been
delighted
because
that
was
her
private
opinion
but
she
was
not
so
certain
that
corroboration
was
unpleasant
she
advanced
gazing
at
the
child
unconsciously
gasping
the
stifling
air
she
took
one
hurried
glance
at
the
room
in
its
scrupulous
bareness
with
waves
of
heat
pouring
in
the
open
window
and
bent
over
peaches
wo
you
come
out
of
this
awful
heat
quickly
and
let
us
carry
you
away
to
a
cool
shady
place
dear
little
girl
do
you
want
to
come
she
questioned
is
mickey
coming
too
asked
peaches
of
course
mickey
is
coming
too
said
the
lady
will
he
hold
me
he
will
if
you
want
him
to
said
harding
but
peter
is
so
much
bigger
it
would
tire
him
a
mite
mickey
shifted
on
his
feet
and
gazed
at
peaches
as
her
eyes
sought
his
the
message
he
telegraphed
her
was
so
plain
that
she
caught
it
right
mickey
is
just
awful
strong
she
said
i
go
if
he
hold
me
but
i
want
to
peter
i
peter
why
you
darling
cried
the
nice
lady
and
i
like
junior
that
mickey
told
me
about
and
your
nice
little
girl
that
i
must
ever
say
no
sw
mickey
promptly
applied
the
flat
of
his
hand
to
the
lips
of
the
astonished
child
and
you
like
the
little
girl
and
the
fat
toddly
baby
he
prompted
yes
agreed
peaches
enthusiastically
twisting
away
her
head
and
i
like
the
milk
and
the
meat
gee
i
like
the
only
mickey
would
give
me
but
a
tiny
speck
he
asked
the
sunshine
nurse
lady
you
blessed
child
cried
nancy
harding
call
peter
quickly
mickey
opened
the
door
and
signalled
peter
and
junior
she
likes
you
she
asked
for
you
you
can
both
come
at
once
he
announced
holding
the
door
at
a
narrow
crack
until
they
reached
it
both
red
faced
dripping
and
fanning
with
their
hats
peter
gasped
for
air
my
god
has
any
living
child
been
cooped
in
this
all
day
he
roared
get
her
out
get
her
out
quick
get
her
out
first
and
talk
afterward
this
will
give
her
scarlet
fever
a
shrill
shout
came
from
behind
the
intervening
lady
who
arose
and
stepped
back
as
peaches
raised
to
her
elbow
and
stretched
a
shaking
hand
toward
peter
gee
peter
you
get
your
mouth
soaped
out
first
she
cried
gee
peter
i
you
peter
peter
bent
over
her
and
then
stooping
to
her
level
he
explored
her
with
astonished
eyes
as
he
cried
why
child
you
ai
big
enough
for
an
exclamation
point
peaches
did
know
what
an
exclamation
point
was
but
mickey
did
his
laugh
brought
him
again
into
her
thought
mickey
let
beat
it
take
me
quick
she
panted
take
me
first
and
talk
afterward
mickey
we
just
love
these
nice
people
let
go
drink
their
milk
and
eat
their
red
berries
well
miss

said
mickey
turning
a
dull
red
the
harding
family
were
laughing
all
right
everybody
move
said
peter
what
do
you
want
to
take

peter

harding
mickey
and
i

exactly
right

it
to
be
taken
from
such
heat

the
conditions

interposed
mickey
dreading
the
next
word
for
the
memories
it

peaches

and
nobody

so

peter
yes

the
ticket

peaches
i
ai
heavy
mickey
carried
me
up
down
is
easier
sure
said
mickey
take
my
own
you
take
yours
we
be
there
in
a
minute
peter
and
junior
disappeared
with
thankfulness
and
speed
harding
and
mickey
wrapped
peaches
in
the
sheet
and
took
along
a
comfort
for
shelter
from
the
air
stirred
by
motion
steadying
his
arm
which
he
wished
she
would
not
they
descended
did
she
think
he
wanted
peaches
to
suppose
he
could
carry
her
he
ran
down
the
last
flight
to
show
her
frightening
her
into
protest
and
had
the
reward
of
a
giggle
against
his
neck
and
the
tightening
of
small
arms
clinging
to
him
he
settled
in
the
car
and
wrapped
lily
in
the
comfort
until
she
had
only
a
small
peep
of
daylight
mickey
knew
from
peaches
laboured
breathing
and
the
grip
of
her
hands
how
agitated
she
was
but
as
the
car
glided
smoothly
along
driven
skilfully
by
mentality
guided
by
the
controlling
thought
of
a
tiny
lame
back
she
became
easier
and
clutched
less
frantically
he
kept
the
comfort
over
her
head
she
had
enough
to
make
the
change
to
see
so
many
strangers
all
at
once
without
being
excited
by
unfamiliar
things
that
would
bewilder
and
positively
frighten
her
mickey
stoutly
clung
to
a
load
that
soon
grew
noticeably
heavy
while
over
and
over
he
repeated
in
his
heart
with
fortifying
intent
she
is
my
family
i
take
care
of
her
i
let
them
keep
her
a
while
because
it
is
too
hot
for
her
there
but
they
sha
her
and
they
got
to
know
it
first
off
and
they
sha
take
her
from
me
and
they
got
to
understand
it
right
at
that
point
mickey
grip
tightened
until
the
child
in
his
arms
shivered
with
delight
of
being
so
enfolded
in
her
old
and
only
security
she
turned
her
head
to
work
her
face
level
with
the
comfort
and
whisper
in
glee
mickey
we
are
going
just
stylish
like
millyingaire
folks
ai
we
you
just
bet
we
are
he
whispered
back
mickey
you
would
let
them
me
would
you
not
on
your
life
said
mickey
gripping
her
closer
and
peter
would
let
them
me
no
peter
would
just
wipe
them
clear
off
the
slate
if
they
tried
to
get
you
comforted
mickey
we
in
the
country
now
lily
nobody
will
even
think
of
you
away
out
here
mickey
i
want
to
see
the
country
said
peaches
no
miss
i
scared
now
replied
mickey
it
was
awful
hot
there
and
it
lots
cooler
here
even
slow
and
careful
as
peter
is
driving
if
you
get
all
excitement
and
rearing
around
and
take
a
chill
and
your
back
gets
worse
just
when
we
have
such
a
grand
good
chance
to
make
it
better
you
duck
and
lay
low
and
if
you
good
and
going
out
make
you
sick
after
supper
when
you
rest
up
maybe
i
let
you
have
a
little
peepy
yellow
chicken
in
your
hand
to
hold
a
minute
and
maybe
i
let
you
see
a
cow
you
give
a
good
deal
to
see
the
cow
going
on
your
book
would
you
peaches
snuggled
down
in
pure
content
and
proved
her
femininity
as
she
did
every
day
yes
but
when
i
see
them
maybe
i
like
a
chicken
better
and
put
it
on
all
right
with
me
agreed
mickey
you
just
hold
still
so
this
does
make
you
sick
and
you
can
see
things
when
you
are
all
nice
and
rested
mickey
she
whispered
mickey
bent
and
what
he
heard
buried
his
face
against
peaches
a
second
and
when
lifted
it
radiated
a
shining
for
she
had
whispered
mickey
i
going
to
always
mind
you
and
love
you
best
of
anybody
because
she
had
expected
the
trip
to
result
in
the
bringing
home
of
the
child
harding
had
made
ready
a
low
folding
davenport
in
her
bedroom
beside
a
window
where
grass
birds
and
trees
were
almost
in
touch
and
where
it
would
be
convenient
to
watch
and
care
for
her
visitor
there
in
the
light
pretty
room
mickey
gently
laid
peaches
down
and
said
now
if
you
just
give
me
time
to
get
her
rested
and
settled
a
little
you
can
see
her
a
peep
but
there
going
to
be
seeing
or
talking
if
she
has
such
a
lot
she
ai
used
to
and
gets
sick
it
will
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
and
all
of
us
so
we
better
just
go
slow
and
easy
right
you
are
young
man
said
peter
come
out
of
here
you
kids
come
to
the
back
yard
and
play
quietly
when
little
white
butterfly
gets
rested
and
fed
we
come
one
at
a
time
and
kiss
her
hand
and
wish
her
pleasant
dreams
with
us
and
then
we
every
one
of
us
get
down
on
our
knees
and
ask
god
to
help
us
take
such
good
care
of
her
that
she
will
get
well
at
our
house
mickey
suddenly
turned
his
back
on
them
and
tried
to
swallow
the
lump
in
his
throat
then
he
arranged
his
family
so
it
was
not
in
a
draft
sponged
and
fed
it
and
failed
in
the
remainder
of
his
promise
because
it
went
to
sleep
with
the
last
bite
and
lay
in
deep
exhaustion
so
mickey
smoothed
the
sheet
slipped
off
the
ribbon
brushed
back
the
curls
shaded
the
light
marshalled
them
in
on
tiptoe
and
with
anxious
heart
studied
their
compassionate
faces
then
he
telephoned
douglas
bruce
to
ask
permission
to
be
away
from
the
office
the
following
day
and
ventured
as
far
from
the
house
as
he
felt
he
dared
with
junior
but
so
anxious
was
he
that
he
kept
in
sight
of
the
window
and
so
manly
and
tender
was
his
scrupulous
care
so
tiny
and
delicate
his
small
charge
as
she
lay
waxen
lightly
breathing
to
show
she
really
lived
that
in
the
hearts
of
the
harding
family
grew
a
deep
respect
for
mickey
and
such
was
their
trust
in
him
that
when
he
folded
his
comfort
and
stretched
it
on
the
floor
beside
the
child
not
even
to
each
other
did
they
think
of
uttering
an
objection
so
peaches
spent
her
first
night
in
the
country
breathing
clover
air
watched
constantly
by
her
staunch
protector
and
carried
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
on
the
lips
of
one
entire
family
for
even
bobbie
was
told
to
add
to
his
prayer
god
bless
the
little
sick
girl
and
make
her
well
at
our
house
chapter
xiv
orphans
margaret
i
want
a
few
words
with
you
some
time
soon
said
james
minturn
to
his
sister
why
not
right
now
she
proposed
i
not
busy
and
for
days
known
you
were
in
trouble
tell
me
at
once
and
possibly
i
can
help
you
you
would
deserve
my
gratitude
if
you
could
he
said
i
suffered
until
i
reduced
to
the
extremity
that
drives
me
to
put
into
words
the
thing
i
have
thrashed
over
in
my
heart
day
and
night
for
weeks
come
to
my
room
james
she
said
james
minturn
followed
his
sister
now
go
on
and
tell
me
boy
she
ordered
of
course
it
about
nellie
yes
it
about
nellie
he
repeated
did
you
hear
any
part
of
what
that
very
charming
young
lady
had
to
say
to
me
at
our
chosen
playground
not
long
ago
yes
i
did
answered
winslow
but
not
enough
to
comprehend
thoroughly
did
she
convince
you
that
you
are
mistaken
no
but
this
she
did
do
said
minturn
she
battered
the
walls
of
what
i
had
believed
to
be
unalterable
decision
until
she
made
this
opening
i
must
go
into
our
affairs
again
i
have
got
to
find
out
where
my
wife
is
and
what
she
is
doing
and
if
the
things
miss
leslie
thinks
are
true
margaret
i
thought
it
was
i
was
happy
in
a
way
actually
happy
no
biblical
miracle
ever
seemed
to
me
half
so
wonderful
as
the
change
in
the
boys
the
difference
in
them
is
quite
as
much
of
a
marvel
as
you
think
it
agreed
winslow
it
is
greater
than
i
would
have
thought
possible
in
any
circumstances
said
minturn
do
they
ever
mention
their
mother
to
you
incidentally
she
replied
just
as
they
do
maids
footman
or
governess
in
referring
to
their
past
life
they
never
ask
for
her
in
the
sense
of
wanting
her
that
i
know
of
malcolm
resembles
her
in
appearance
and
any
one
could
see
that
she
liked
him
best
she
always
discriminated
against
james
in
his
favour
if
any
question
between
them
were
ever
carried
to
her
malcolm
is
like
her
in
more
than
looks
he
has
her
musical
ability
in
a
marked
degree
said
minturn
i
have
none
but
miss
winton
suggested
a
thing
to
me
that
tower
has
been
able
to
work
up
some
and
while
both
boys
are
deeply
interested
it
malcolm
who
is
beginning
to
slip
away
alone
and
listen
to
and
practise
bird
cries
until
he
deceives
the
birds
themselves
yesterday
he
called
a
catbird
to
within
a
few
feet
of
him
by
reproducing
the
notes
as
uttered
and
inflected
by
the
female
i
know
it
was
a
triumph
he
told
me
about
it
james
is
well
named
said
minturn
he
is
my
boy
already
beginning
to
ask
questions
that
are
filled
with
intelligence
solicitude
and
interest
about
my
business
what
things
mean
what
i
am
doing
and
why
he
going
to
make
the
man
who
will
come
into
my
office
who
in
a
few
more
years
will
be
offering
his
shoulder
for
part
of
my
load
you
ca
understand
what
the
change
is
from
the
old
attitude
of
regarding
me
as
worth
no
consideration
not
even
a
gentleman
as
my
wife
servants
were
teaching
my
sons
to
think
margaret
how
am
i
going
back
even
to
the
thought
that
i
may
be
making
a
mistake
would
the
unpardonable
error
be
to
again
risk
those
boys
an
hour
in
the
company
and
influence
which
brought
them
once
to
what
they
were
you
poor
soul
exclaimed
winslow
never
mind
that
warned
minturn
i
not
accustomed
to
it
and
it
does
help
have
you
any
faith
in
nellie
none
whatever
exclaimed
winslow
she
so
selfish
it
simply
fiendish
i
as
soon
bury
you
as
to
see
you
subject
to
her
again
and
i
much
sooner
be
buried
were
it
not
that
my
heart
is
set
on
winning
out
with
those
boys
said
minturn
there
is
material
for
fine
men
in
them
but
there
is
also
depravity
that
would
shock
you
inexpressibly
instilled
by
ignorant
malicious
servants
i
wish
leslie
winton
had
kept
quiet
and
so
do
i
agreed
winslow
i
could
scarcely
endure
it
as
i
realized
what
was
going
on
while
nellie
had
you
there
was
no
indignity
no
public
humiliation
at
which
she
stopped
for
my
own
satisfaction
i
examined
elizabeth
before
she
was
laid
away
and
i
held
my
tongue
because
i
thought
you
did
know
when
you
find
out
a
newsboy
told
me
he
went
with
a
woman
who
was
in
the
park
where
it
happened
to
tell
nellie
but
they
were
insulted
for
their
pains
some
way
my
best
friend
douglas
bruce
picked
him
up
and
attached
him
as
i
did
william
it
was
at
my
suggestion
of
course
i
could
imagine
that
out
of
several
thousand
newsies
douglas
would
select
the
one
who
knew
my
secret
and
who
daily
blasts
me
with
his
scorn
if
he
runs
into
an
elevator
where
i
am
the
whistle
dies
on
his
lips
his
smile
fades
and
he
actually
shrinks
from
my
presence
you
ca
blame
him
a
man
be
able
to
protect
the
children
he
what
he
said
to
me
stunned
me
so
he
thought
me
indifferent
in
my
place
would
you
stop
him
some
day
and
explain
i
most
certainly
would
said
winslow
a
child
scorn
is
withering
and
you
do
deserve
it
i
have
often
wondered
what
or
how
much
he
told
bruce
said
minturn
could
you
detect
any
change
in
bruce
after
the
boy
came
into
his
office
asked
winslow
only
that
he
was
kinder
and
friendlier
than
ever
that
probably
means
that
the
boy
told
him
and
that
bruce
understood
and
was
sorry
no
doubt
he
said
you
talk
to
the
boy
then
now
what
would
you
do
about
nellie
what
was
it
miss
winton
thought
you
do
see
nellie
take
her
back
he
exclaimed
give
her
further
opportunity
to
exercise
her
brand
of
wifehood
on
me
and
motherhood
on
the
boys
james
if
you
do
i
never
forgive
you
cried
his
sister
if
you
tear
up
this
comfortable
healthful
place
where
you
are
the
honoured
head
of
your
house
and
put
your
boys
back
where
you
found
them
go
home
and
stay
there
and
you
ca
blame
me
miss
winton
did
ask
me
to
go
back
he
explained
that
could
be
done
i
saw
and
examined
the
deed
of
gift
of
the
premises
to
the
city
the
only
thing
she
could
do
would
be
to
buy
it
back
and
it
torn
up
inside
and
will
be
in
shape
for
opening
any
day
now
i
hear
the
city
needed
a
children
hospital
to
get
a
place
like
that
free
in
so
beautiful
and
convenient
a
location
and
her
old
friends
are
furious
at
her
for
bringing
sickness
and
crooked
bodies
among
them
no
doubt
they
would
welcome
her
there
but
they
would
welcome
her
anywhere
else
she
must
have
endowed
it
liberally
no
hospital
in
the
city
has
a
staff
of
the
strength
announced
for
it
james
you
are
wandering
she
interrupted
you
started
to
tell
me
what
miss
winton
asked
of
you
that
i
bring
nellie
here
he
explained
that
i
make
her
mistress
of
this
house
that
i
put
myself
and
the
boys
in
her
hands
again
oh
good
lord
ejaculated
winslow
james
are
you
actually
thinking
of
mind
i
do
care
for
myself
i
have
a
home
and
all
i
want
but
for
you
and
those
boys
are
you
really
contemplating
it
no
he
said
all
i
thinking
of
is
whether
it
is
my
duty
to
hunt
her
up
and
once
more
convince
myself
that
she
is
heartless
vanity
personified
and
utterly
indifferent
to
me
personally
as
i
am
to
her
suppose
you
do
go
to
her
and
find
that
through
pique
because
you
made
the
move
for
separation
yourself
she
wants
to
try
it
over
or
to
get
the
boys
again
she
got
a
mint
of
money
do
you
know
just
how
much
she
has
i
do
not
and
i
never
did
he
replied
her
funds
never
in
any
part
were
in
my
hands
i
felt
capable
of
making
all
i
needed
myself
and
i
have
i
earn
as
much
as
it
is
right
i
should
have
but
she
scorn
my
plan
for
life
and
what
satisfies
me
and
she
think
the
boys
disgraced
living
as
they
are
james
was
there
an
hour
even
in
your
honeymoon
when
nellie
forgot
herself
and
was
a
lovable
woman
it
is
painful
to
recall
but
yes
yes
indeed
he
answered
never
did
a
man
marry
with
higher
hope
then
what
marvelled
winslow
primarily
her
mother
then
her
society
friends
then
the
power
of
her
money
he
answered
just
how
did
it
happen
she
queried
it
began
with
blondon
violent
opposition
to
children
when
she
knew
a
child
was
coming
she
practically
moved
in
with
us
and
spent
hours
pitying
her
daughter
sending
for
a
doctor
at
each
inevitable
consequence
keeping
up
an
exciting
rush
of
friends
coming
when
the
girl
should
have
had
quiet
and
rest
treating
me
with
contempt
and
daily
holding
me
up
as
the
monster
responsible
for
all
these
things
the
result
was
nervousness
and
discontent
bred
by
such
a
course
at
such
a
time
until
it
amounted
to
actual
pain
and
lastly
unlimited
money
with
which
to
indulge
every
fancy
in
such
circumstances
delivery
became
the
horror
they
made
of
it
although
several
of
the
doctors
told
me
privately
not
to
have
the
slightest
alarm
it
was
simply
the
method
of
rich
selfish
women
to
make
such
a
bugbear
of
childbirth
a
wife
might
well
be
excused
for
refusing
to
endure
it
sifted
to
the
bottom
that
was
what
it
i
did
know
until
the
birth
of
james
that
they
had
neglected
to
follow
the
instructions
of
their
doctors
and
made
no
preparation
for
nursing
the
child
as
a
result
when
i
insisted
that
it
must
be
done
shrieks
of
pain
painful
enough
as
i
could
see
resulted
in
a
nervous
chill
for
the
mother
more
inhumanity
in
me
and
the
boy
was
turned
over
to
a
hired
woman
with
his
first
breath
and
to
begin
unnatural
life
i
watched
the
little
chap
all
i
could
he
was
strong
and
healthy
and
while
skilled
nurses
were
available
he
upset
every
rule
by
thriving
which
was
one
more
count
against
me
and
the
lesson
pointed
out
and
driven
home
that
no
young
wife
could
give
a
child
such
attention
so
the
baby
was
better
off
in
the
hands
of
the
nurse
that
he
was
reared
without
love
that
his
mother
took
not
an
iota
of
responsibility
in
his
care
developed
not
a
trait
of
motherhood
simply
went
on
being
a
society
belle
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
did
so
well
nellie
escaped
so
much
better
than
many
of
her
friends
that
in
time
she
seemed
to
forget
it
and
did
rebel
at
malcolm
advent
or
elizabeth
but
by
that
time
i
had
been
practically
ostracized
from
the
nursery
governesses
were
empowered
to
flout
and
insult
me
i
scarcely
saw
my
children
and
what
i
did
see
made
me
furious
so
i
vetoed
more
orphans
bearing
my
name
and
gave
up
doing
anything
then
came
the
tragedy
of
elizabeth
surely
you
understand
how
it
was
done
margaret
of
course
i
had
an
idea
but
i
never
before
got
just
the
perfect
picture
and
now
i
have
it
though
it
the
last
word
i
to
say
to
you
god
made
me
so
that
i
forced
to
say
it
although
it
furnishes
one
more
example
of
what
is
called
inconsistency
be
careful
what
you
say
margaret
i
must
say
it
she
replied
i
encouraged
you
to
talk
in
detail
because
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
was
right
in
the
position
i
was
taking
but
you
given
me
a
different
viewpoint
why
james
think
it
over
yourself
in
the
light
of
what
you
just
have
told
me
nellie
never
has
been
a
mother
at
all
her
heart
is
more
barren
than
that
of
a
woman
to
whom
motherhood
is
physical
impossibility
yet
whose
heart
aches
with
maternal
instinct
margaret
cried
james
minturn
james
it
true
she
persisted
i
never
have
understood
for
fear
of
that
i
led
you
on
and
now
look
what
you
told
me
nellie
never
had
a
chance
at
natural
motherhood
the
thing
called
society
made
a
foolish
mother
to
begin
with
while
she
in
turn
ruined
her
daughter
and
if
elizabeth
had
lived
it
would
have
been
passed
on
to
her
you
throw
a
new
light
on
nellie
as
long
as
she
was
herself
she
was
tender
and
loving
and
you
adored
her
if
you
had
been
alone
and
moderately
circumstanced
she
would
have
continued
being
so
lovable
that
after
ten
years
your
face
flushes
with
painful
memory
as
you
speak
of
it
always
thought
her
abandoned
as
to
wifely
and
motherly
instinct
what
you
say
proves
she
was
a
lovable
girl
ruined
by
society
through
the
medium
of
her
mother
and
friends
if
she
cared
for
me
as
she
said
she
should
have
been
enough
of
a
woman
began
minturn
maybe
she
but
you
must
take
into
consideration
that
she
was
not
herself
when
the
trouble
began
she
was
as
are
all
women
even
those
most
delighted
over
the
prospect
in
an
unnatural
condition
so
far
that
usual
conditions
were
and
probably
made
her
ill
nervous
apprehensive
not
herself
at
all
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
changing
worse
than
that
she
said
emphatically
i
have
positively
and
permanently
changed
even
at
your
expense
i
will
do
nellie
justice
james
your
grievance
is
not
against
your
wife
it
is
against
the
mother
who
bore
her
the
society
that
moulded
her
she
should
have
been
woman
enough
he
began
left
alone
she
was
insisted
winslow
with
the
ills
and
apprehensions
of
motherhood
upon
her
she
yielded
as
most
young
inexperienced
women
would
yield
to
what
came
under
the
guise
of
tender
solicitude
and
no
doubt
eased
or
banished
pain
which
all
of
us
avoid
when
possible
and
the
pain
connected
with
motherhood
is
a
thing
in
awe
of
which
the
most
practised
physicians
admit
themselves
almost
stunned
the
woman
who
would
put
aside
pampering
and
stoically
endure
what
money
and
friends
could
alleviate
is
rare
jim
pain
or
no
pain
to
you
you
must
find
your
wife
and
learn
for
yourself
if
she
is
heartless
or
whether
in
some
miraculous
way
some
one
has
proved
to
her
what
you
have
made
plain
as
possible
to
me
you
must
hunt
her
up
and
if
she
is
still
under
her
mother
and
society
influence
and
refuses
let
her
remain
but
but
if
she
has
changed
as
you
have
just
seen
me
change
then
you
should
give
her
another
chance
if
she
asks
it
i
ca
he
cried
you
must
the
evidence
is
in
her
favour
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
impatiently
her
acquiescence
in
your
right
to
take
the
boys
and
alter
their
method
of
life
her
agreement
that
for
their
sakes
you
might
do
as
you
chose
with
no
interference
from
her
both
those
are
the
acknowledgment
of
failure
on
her
part
and
willingness
for
you
to
repair
the
damages
if
you
can
she
explained
her
gift
of
a
residence
the
furnishings
of
which
would
have
paid
for
the
slight
alterations
necessary
to
transform
a
modern
home
into
the
most
beautiful
of
modern
hospitals
in
a
wonderfully
lovely
location
and
leave
enough
to
start
it
with
as
fine
a
staff
as
money
can
provide
that
gift
is
a
deliberately
planned
effort
at
reparation
the
limiting
of
patients
to
children
under
ten
is
her
heart
trying
to
tell
yours
that
she
would
atone
o
lord
cried
james
minturn
yes
i
know
said
winslow
call
on
him
you
need
him
there
is
no
question
but
that
he
put
into
her
head
the
idea
of
setting
a
home
for
the
healing
of
little
children
in
the
most
exclusive
residence
district
of
multiopolis
where
women
of
millions
are
forced
to
see
it
every
time
they
look
from
a
window
or
step
from
their
door
have
you
seen
it
yourself
james
naturally
i
would
haunt
the
location
i
would
and
i
did
said
winslow
a
few
days
ago
i
went
over
it
from
basement
to
garret
you
go
and
see
it
and
i
recall
now
that
her
lawyer
was
there
with
sheets
of
paper
in
his
hand
talking
with
workmen
i
think
he
working
for
nellie
and
that
she
is
probably
directing
the
changes
and
personally
evolving
a
big
white
shining
reparation
it
a
late
date
to
talk
about
reparation
he
said
which
simply
drives
me
to
the
truism
late
than
never
and
to
the
addition
of
the
comment
that
nellie
is
only
thirty
and
that
but
ten
years
of
your
lives
have
been
wasted
if
you
hurry
and
save
the
remainder
you
should
have
fifty
apiece
coming
to
you
if
you
breathe
deep
sleep
cool
and
dine
sensibly
said
winslow
she
walked
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
james
minturn
sat
thinking
a
long
time
then
called
his
car
and
drove
to
atwater
alone
he
found
leslie
in
the
orchard
a
book
of
bird
scores
in
her
hands
and
several
sheets
of
music
beside
her
her
greeting
was
so
cordial
so
frankly
sweet
and
womanly
he
could
scarcely
endure
it
because
his
head
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
his
wife
you
are
still
at
your
bird
study
he
asked
yes
it
the
most
fascinating
thing
she
said
i
know
he
conceded
i
want
the
titles
of
the
books
you
using
i
mentioned
it
to
tower
our
tutor
and
he
was
interested
instantly
and
far
more
capable
of
going
at
it
intelligently
than
i
am
because
he
has
some
musical
training
ever
since
we
talked
it
over
he
and
the
boys
have
been
at
work
in
a
crude
way
you
might
be
amused
at
their
results
but
to
me
they
are
wonderful
they
began
hiding
in
bird
haunts
and
listening
working
on
imitations
of
cries
and
calls
and
reproducing
what
they
heard
until
in
a
few
weeks
time
why
i
do
even
know
their
repertoire
but
they
can
call
quail
larks
owls
orioles
so
perfectly
they
get
answers
james
will
never
do
anything
worth
while
in
music
he
too
much
like
me
but
malcolm
is
saving
his
money
and
working
to
buy
a
violin
he
going
to
read
a
music
score
faster
than
he
will
a
book
i
hunting
an
instructor
for
him
who
will
start
his
education
on
the
subjects
which
interest
him
most
do
you
know
any
one
leslie
no
one
who
could
do
more
than
study
with
him
it
a
branch
that
is
just
being
taken
up
but
i
have
talked
of
it
quite
a
bit
with
dovesky
the
harmony
director
of
the
conservatory
if
you
go
to
him
and
make
him
understand
what
you
want
along
every
line
i
think
he
take
malcolm
as
a
special
student
i
love
to
help
him
as
far
as
i
gone
but
i
only
a
beginner
myself
and
i
no
such
ability
as
it
is
very
possible
he
may
have
he
has
it
said
minturn
conclusively
he
has
his
mother
fine
ear
and
artistic
perception
if
she
undertook
it
what
a
success
she
could
make
i
never
saw
her
so
interested
in
anything
as
she
was
that
day
at
the
tamarack
swamp
said
leslie
and
her
heart
was
full
of
other
matters
too
but
she
recognized
the
songs
i
took
her
to
hear
she
said
she
never
had
been
so
attracted
by
a
new
idea
in
her
whole
life
leslie
i
came
to
you
this
morning
about
nellie
i
promised
you
to
think
matters
over
and
i
done
nothing
else
since
i
last
saw
you
hateful
as
has
been
the
occupation
you
still
sure
of
what
you
said
about
her
then
positively
cried
leslie
do
you
hear
from
her
he
asked
no
she
answered
you
spoke
of
a
letter
he
suggested
a
note
she
wrote
me
before
leaving
explained
leslie
you
see
been
with
her
all
day
and
we
had
raced
home
so
joyously
and
when
things
came
out
as
they
did
she
knew
i
would
understand
might
i
see
it
he
asked
surely
said
leslie
i
spoke
of
that
the
other
day
i
bring
it
when
leslie
returned
james
minturn
read
the
missive
several
times
then
he
handed
it
back
saying
what
is
there
in
that
leslie
to
prove
your
points
three
things
said
leslie
with
conviction
the
statement
that
for
an
hour
after
she
reached
her
decision
she
experienced
real
joy
and
expected
to
render
the
same
to
you
the
acknowledgment
that
she
understood
that
you
did
know
what
you
were
doing
to
her
in
your
reception
of
her
and
the
final
admission
that
life
now
held
so
little
for
her
that
she
would
gladly
end
it
if
she
dared
without
making
what
reparation
she
could
what
more
do
you
want
you
very
sure
you
are
drawing
the
right
deductions
he
asked
i
wish
you
would
sit
down
and
let
me
tell
you
of
that
day
said
leslie
i
have
come
to
you
for
help
said
james
minturn
i
would
be
more
than
glad
if
you
be
so
kind
at
the
end
i
do
think
i
missed
a
word
said
leslie
that
day
is
and
always
will
be
sharply
outlined
you
not
heard
from
her
since
that
note
he
asked
you
do
know
where
she
is
no
said
leslie
i
have
an
idea
where
you
could
find
her
but
because
of
her
lawyer
superintending
the
hospital
repairs
because
of
the
wonderful
way
things
are
being
done
daddy
thinks
it
sure
that
the
work
is
in
john
haynes
hands
and
that
she
is
directing
it
through
him
if
it
were
not
for
the
war
i
would
know
said
minturn
but
understanding
her
as
i
do
i
think
instead
of
understanding
her
so
well
you
scarcely
know
her
at
all
said
leslie
gently
you
may
have
had
a
few
months
of
her
real
nature
to
begin
with
but
when
her
rearing
and
environment
ruled
her
life
the
real
woman
was
either
perverted
or
had
small
chance
do
you
ever
stop
to
think
what
kind
of
a
man
you
might
have
been
if
all
your
life
you
had
been
forced
and
influenced
as
nellie
was
good
lord
cried
minturn
exactly
agreed
leslie
that
what
i
telling
you
she
had
got
to
the
realization
of
the
fact
that
her
life
had
been
husks
and
ashes
so
she
went
to
beg
you
to
help
her
to
a
better
way
and
you
failed
her
i
not
saying
it
was
your
fault
i
not
saying
i
blame
you
merely
stating
facts
margaret
blames
me
said
minturn
she
thinks
i
enough
at
fault
that
i
never
can
find
happiness
until
i
locate
nellie
and
learn
whether
she
is
with
her
mother
and
friends
or
if
she
really
meant
what
she
said
about
changing
enough
to
go
ahead
and
be
different
from
principle
her
change
was
radical
and
permanent
i
got
to
know
said
minturn
but
i
no
faith
in
her
ability
to
change
and
no
desire
to
meet
her
if
she
has
humph
said
leslie
that
proves
that
you
need
some
changing
yourself
i
certainly
do
said
james
minturn
if
i
could
have
an
operation
on
my
brain
which
would
remove
that
particular
cell
in
which
is
stored
the
memory
of
the
past
ten
years
you
will
when
you
see
her
said
leslie
and
she
be
your
surgeon
impossible
he
cried
go
find
her
said
leslie
you
must
to
regain
peace
for
yourself
james
minturn
returned
a
troubled
man
but
with
viewpoint
shifting
so
imperceptibly
he
did
not
realize
what
was
happening
on
his
way
he
decided
to
visit
the
hospital
repugnant
as
the
thought
was
to
him
from
afar
he
was
amazed
at
sight
of
the
building
he
knew
instantly
that
it
must
have
been
the
leading
topic
of
conversation
among
his
friends
purposely
avoided
in
his
presence
marble
pillars
and
decorations
had
been
freshly
cleaned
the
building
was
snowdrift
white
it
shone
through
the
branches
of
big
trees
surrounding
it
like
a
fairy
palace
at
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
entrance
stood
a
marble
group
of
heroic
proportions
that
was
wonderful
it
was
a
seated
figure
of
christ
but
cut
with
the
face
of
a
man
of
his
station
occupation
and
race
garbed
in
simple
robe
and
in
his
arms
at
his
knees
leaning
against
him
a
group
of
children
the
lean
sick
and
ailing
such
as
were
carried
to
him
for
healing
cut
in
the
wall
above
it
in
large
letters
was
the
admonition
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
that
group
was
the
work
of
a
student
and
a
thinker
who
could
carry
an
idea
to
a
logical
conclusion
and
then
carve
it
from
marble
the
thought
it
gave
james
minturn
arrested
before
it
was
not
the
stereotyped
idea
of
christ
not
the
conventional
reproduction
of
childhood
it
impressed
on
minturn
brain
that
the
man
of
galilee
had
lived
in
the
form
of
other
men
of
his
day
and
that
such
a
face
filled
with
infinite
compassion
was
much
stronger
and
more
forceful
than
that
of
the
mild
feminine
countenance
he
had
been
accustomed
to
associating
with
the
saviour
he
entered
the
door
to
find
his
former
home
filled
with
workmen
and
the
opening
day
almost
at
hand
everywhere
was
sanitary
whiteness
the
reception
hall
was
ready
for
guests
his
library
occupied
by
the
matron
the
a
storeroom
the
second
and
third
floors
in
separate
wards
save
the
big
ballroom
now
whiter
than
ever
its
touches
of
gold
freshly
gleaming
beautiful
flowers
in
tubs
canaries
singing
in
a
brass
house
filling
one
end
of
the
room
tiny
chairs
cots
every
conceivable
form
of
comfort
and
amusement
for
convalescing
little
children
the
pipe
organ
remained
in
place
music
boxes
and
wonderful
mechanical
toys
had
been
added
rugs
that
had
been
in
the
house
were
spread
on
the
floor
no
normal
man
could
study
and
interpret
the
intention
of
that
place
unmoved
all
over
the
building
was
the
same
beautiful
whiteness
the
same
comfort
and
thoughtful
preparation
for
the
purpose
it
was
designed
to
fill
the
operating
rooms
were
perfect
the
whole
the
result
of
loving
thought
careful
execution
and
uncounted
expense
he
came
in
time
to
the
locked
door
of
his
wife
suite
and
before
he
left
the
building
he
met
her
lawyer
he
offered
his
hand
and
said
heartily
my
sister
told
me
of
the
wonderful
work
going
on
here
she
advised
me
to
come
and
see
for
myself
i
am
very
glad
i
did
something
bigger
than
the
usual
idea
in
this
that
keeps
obtruding
itself
i
think
that
too
agreed
john
haynes
i
almost
quit
my
practice
to
work
out
these
plans
they
are
my
wife
by
any
chance
all
hers
said
haynes
i
only
carry
out
her
instructions
as
they
come
to
me
will
you
give
me
her
address
asked
minturn
i
should
like
to
tell
her
how
great
i
think
this
i
carry
a
packet
for
you
that
came
with
a
bundle
of
plans
this
morning
said
haynes
perhaps
her
address
is
in
it
if
it
is
i
ca
give
it
to
you
because
i
have
it
myself
she
not
in
the
city
all
her
instructions
she
sends
some
one
possibly
at
her
home
and
they
are
delivered
to
me
i
give
my
communications
to
the
boy
who
brings
her
orders
then
i
write
my
note
and
you
give
it
to
him
i
sorry
minturn
said
haynes
but
i
have
my
orders
in
the
event
you
should
wish
to
reach
her
through
me
she
does
wish
to
hear
from
me
i
sorry
no
end
minturn
but
possibly
this
contains
what
i
want
to
know
said
minturn
thank
you
and
i
congratulate
you
on
your
work
here
it
is
humane
in
the
finest
degree
james
minturn
went
to
his
office
and
opened
the
packet
it
was
a
complete
accounting
of
every
dollar
his
wife
was
worth
this
divided
exactly
into
thirds
one
of
which
she
kept
one
she
transferred
to
him
and
the
other
she
placed
in
his
care
for
her
sons
to
be
equally
divided
between
them
at
his
discretion
he
returned
and
found
the
lawyer
had
gone
to
his
office
he
followed
and
showed
him
the
documents
what
she
places
to
my
credit
for
our
sons
that
i
will
handle
with
the
utmost
care
he
said
what
she
puts
at
my
personal
disposal
i
do
not
accept
we
are
living
comfortably
and
as
expensively
as
i
desire
to
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
take
such
a
sum
at
her
hands
even
though
she
has
more
than
i
would
have
estimated
you
will
kindly
return
this
deed
of
transfer
to
her
with
my
thanks
and
a
note
i
will
enclose
sorry
minturn
but
as
i
told
you
before
i
have
her
address
working
on
a
salary
i
should
dislike
to
forfeit
and
my
orders
are
distinct
concerning
you
you
could
give
me
no
idea
where
to
find
her
not
the
slightest
said
the
lawyer
will
you
take
charge
of
these
papers
he
questioned
i
dare
not
replied
haynes
will
you
ask
her
if
you
may
persisted
minturn
sorry
minturn
but
perhaps
if
you
should
see
my
instructions
in
the
case
you
understand
better
i
do
wish
you
to
think
me
disobliging
minturn
took
the
sheet
and
read
the
indicated
paragraph
written
in
his
wife
clear
hand
winton
was
very
good
to
me
my
last
day
in
multiopolis
she
was
with
me
when
i
reached
a
decision
concerning
my
future
relations
with
minturn
as
i
would
have
arranged
them
and
i
am
quite
sure
when
she
knows
of
our
separation
she
will
feel
that
it
would
not
have
occurred
had
james
known
of
this
decision
of
mine
it
would
have
made
no
difference
but
i
am
convinced
leslie
will
think
it
would
and
that
she
will
go
to
james
about
it
i
doubt
if
it
will
change
his
attitude
but
if
by
any
possibility
it
should
and
if
in
any
event
whatever
he
comes
to
you
seeking
my
address
or
me
i
depend
on
you
to
in
no
way
help
him
if
it
should
happen
that
you
could
for
this
reason
i
am
keeping
it
out
of
your
power
unless
i
make
some
misstep
that
points
to
where
i
am
i
do
wish
to
make
any
mystery
of
my
location
or
to
disregard
any
intention
that
it
is
barely
possible
leslie
could
bring
minturn
to
concerning
me
i
merely
wish
to
be
left
alone
for
a
time
to
work
out
my
own
expiation
if
there
be
any
and
to
test
my
soul
until
i
know
for
myself
whether
it
is
possible
for
a
social
leopard
to
change
her
spots
i
have
got
to
know
absolutely
that
i
am
beyond
question
a
woman
fit
to
be
a
wife
and
mother
before
i
again
trust
myself
in
any
relation
of
life
toward
any
minturn
returned
the
sheet
his
face
deeply
thoughtful
i
see
her
point
he
said
i
will
deposit
the
papers
in
a
safety
vault
until
she
comes
and
in
accordance
with
this
i
shall
make
no
effort
to
find
her
my
wife
feels
that
she
must
work
out
her
own
salvation
and
i
am
beginning
to
realize
that
a
thorough
and
revelation
will
not
hurt
me
thank
you
good
morning
chapter
xv
particular
peaches
awakened
early
the
following
morning
but
mickey
was
watching
beside
her
to
help
her
remember
to
prompt
to
soothe
to
comfort
and
to
teach
he
followed
harding
to
the
kitchen
and
from
the
prepared
food
selected
what
he
thought
came
closest
filling
the
diet
prescribed
by
the
sunshine
nurse
and
then
he
carried
the
tray
to
a
fresh
cool
peaches
beside
a
window
opening
on
a
grassy
lawn
her
room
was
bewildering
on
account
of
its
many
and
to
the
child
magnificent
furnishings
she
found
herself
stretching
twisting
and
filled
with
a
wild
desire
to
walk
to
see
the
house
the
little
girl
and
the
real
baby
the
lawn
beyond
her
window
the
the
red
berries
where
they
grew
and
the
birds
and
animals
from
which
came
the
most
amazing
sounds
after
doing
everything
for
peaches
he
could
mickey
went
to
his
breakfast
mary
harding
and
bobbie
were
so
anxious
to
see
the
visitor
they
could
scarcely
eat
knowing
it
was
no
use
to
try
forcing
them
their
mother
excused
them
and
they
ventured
as
far
as
the
door
there
they
stopped
gazing
at
the
little
stranger
while
she
stared
back
at
them
but
she
was
not
frightened
because
she
knew
who
they
were
and
that
they
would
be
good
to
her
else
mickey
would
not
let
them
come
so
when
mary
holding
little
brother
hand
came
peeping
around
the
peaches
withdrew
her
attention
from
exploration
of
the
strip
of
lawn
in
her
range
and
concentrated
on
them
if
they
had
come
bounding
at
her
she
would
have
been
frightened
but
they
did
not
they
stood
still
half
afraid
watching
the
tiny
white
creature
till
suddenly
she
smiled
at
them
and
held
out
her
hand
i
like
you
she
said
did
you
have
red
berries
for
breakfus
mary
nodded
and
smiled
back
i
think
you
a
pretty
little
girl
said
peaches
i
ai
half
as
pretty
as
you
said
mary
no
you
ai
she
admitted
your
family
do
put
your
ribbon
on
you
night
do
they
mickey
put
mine
on
this
morning
i
have
to
look
nice
and
be
jus
as
good
else
i
have
to
be
took
back
to
the
hot
room
do
you
have
to
be
nice
too
yes
i
have
to
be
a
good
girl
said
mary
what
does
your
family
do
to
you
if
you
do
mind
i
ai
going
to
tell
but
it
makes
me
said
mary
what
does
yours
do
to
you
i
ai
going
to
tell
either
said
peaches
but
i
get
jus
as
good
what
your
name
mary
what
his
bobbie
mostly
we
call
him
little
brother
ai
he
sweet
asked
mary
jus
a
precious
child
let
him
mark
on
my
slate
mickey
hurried
to
the
room
as
he
neared
the
door
he
stepped
softly
and
peeped
inside
it
was
a
problem
with
him
as
to
how
far
mary
and
bobbie
could
be
trusted
having
been
with
peaches
every
day
he
could
not
accurately
mark
improvements
but
he
could
see
that
her
bones
did
not
protrude
so
far
that
her
skin
was
not
the
yellow
glisteny
horror
it
had
been
that
the
calloused
spots
were
going
under
the
steady
rubbing
of
nightly
oil
massage
so
lately
he
had
added
the
same
treatment
to
her
feet
if
they
were
not
less
bony
if
the
skin
were
not
soft
and
taking
on
a
pinkish
colour
mickey
felt
that
his
eyes
were
unreliable
surely
she
was
better
of
course
she
was
better
she
had
to
be
she
ate
more
she
sat
up
longer
she
moved
her
feet
where
first
they
had
hung
helpless
she
was
better
much
better
and
for
that
especial
reason
now
was
the
time
to
watch
closer
than
before
now
he
must
make
sure
that
a
big
strong
child
did
not
drag
her
from
the
bed
and
forever
undo
all
he
had
gained
since
he
had
written
carrel
mickey
had
rubbed
in
desperation
not
only
nights
but
mornings
also
lest
he
had
asked
help
before
he
was
ready
for
it
for
the
sunshine
lady
had
said
explicitly
that
the
sick
back
could
not
be
operated
until
the
child
was
stronger
he
was
working
according
to
instructions
mickey
watched
any
one
could
have
seen
the
delicate
flush
on
cheek
that
morning
the
hint
of
red
on
her
lips
the
clearing
whites
of
her
lovely
eyes
she
was
helping
bobbie
as
mickey
had
taught
her
and
bobbie
approved
mightily
he
lifted
his
face
put
up
his
arms
and
issued
his
command
take
bobbie
no
no
bobbie
cautioned
mary
mother
said
no
you
must
stay
on
the
floor
sister
will
take
you
you
must
touch
peaches
god
makes
her
well
you
asked
him
last
night
do
you
know
mother
will
spank
something
awful
if
you
touch
her
you
must
be
careful
her
back
is
well
mother
said
so
and
father
too
father
said
it
crosser
than
mother
do
you
remember
must
touch
repeated
bobbie
drawing
back
mickey
was
satisfied
with
harding
instructions
but
he
took
the
opportunity
to
emphasize
a
few
points
himself
he
even
slipped
one
white
bony
foot
from
under
the
sheet
and
showed
mary
how
sick
it
was
and
how
carefully
it
must
be
rubbed
before
it
would
walk
i
can
rub
it
announced
mary
well
do
you
try
that
cautioned
mickey
why
go
on
and
let
her
interposed
peaches
go
on
and
let
her
after
today
you
said
you
be
gone
all

if

she
stretched
up
her
arms
and
mickey
sank
into
them
he
buried
his
face
beside
hers
and
for
the
first
time
she
patted
him
and
whispered
to
him
as
she
did
to
her
doll
she
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his

over
him
and
held
him
tight

she
promised
and
lifted
her
lips
to
seal
the
pact
with
a
kiss
that
meant
more
to
mickey
than
all
that
had
preceded
it
just
how
do
you
feel
anyway
fine
said
peaches
i
can
tell
by
how
it
is
right
now
that
it
going
to
get
all
smothery
an
sweatin
here
whoohoo
it
so
good
mickey
mickey
bent
over
her
holding
both
hands
and
whispered
then
just
you
keep
right
before
your
eyes
where
you
came
from
miss
and
what
you
must
go
to
if
you
do
behave
you
will
be
a
good
girl
you
honest
jus
as
good
well
how
goes
it
with
the
little
white
butterfly
asked
peter
at
the
door
mickey
looked
at
peaches
to
slightly
nod
encouragement
then
he
slipped
from
the
room
she
gave
peter
a
smile
of
wonderment
and
answered
readily
grand
as
you
jus
so
nice
and
fine
now
peter
had
known
it
but
all
his
life
he
had
been
big
handled
rough
tools
tasks
implements
and
animals
while
his
body
grew
sinewy
and
hard
to
cope
with
his
task
his
heart
demanded
more
refined
things
so
if
peaches
had
known
the
most
musical
languages
on
earth
she
could
not
have
used
words
to
peter
that
would
have
served
her
better
he
radiated
content
good
he
cried
that
grand
and
good
i
did
take
a
fair
look
at
you
last
night
it
was
so
sissing
hot
in
that
place
and
you
went
to
sleep
before
i
got
my
chores
done
but
now
we
must
get
acquainted
tell
me
honey
does
any
particular
place
in
your
little
body
hurt
you
if
there
does
put
your
hand
and
show
peter
where
peaches
stared
at
peter
then
she
faintly
smiled
at
him
and
laid
a
fluttering
hand
on
her
left
side
oh
shockings
mourned
peter
that
too
bad
that
vital
your
heart
right
under
there
honey
is
there
a
pain
in
your
peaches
nodded
solemnly
not
the
time
she
explained
only
like
now
when
you
are
so
to
me
jus
so
fine
and
good
then
and
there
peter
surrendered
he
bent
and
kissed
the
hand
he
held
and
said
with
tears
saturating
his
words
just
as
tears
do
permeate
speech
sometimes
pshaw
now
little
white
butterfly
i
never
was
more
pleased
to
hear
anything
in
my
life
ma
and
i
have
talked
for
years
of
having
some
city
children
here
for
summer
but
we
been
slow
trying
it
because
we
hear
such
bad
reports
from
many
of
them
and
it
natural
for
people
to
shield
their
own
but
i
guess
instead
of
shielding
we
may
have
been
denying
i
ca
see
anything
about
you
children
to
hurt
ours
and
i
notice
a
number
of
ways
where
it
is
beneficial
to
have
you
here
it
surely
good
for
all
of
us
you
the
nicest
little
folks
peaches
sat
up
suddenly
and
smiled
on
peter
mickey
is
nice
an
fine
she
told
him
not
even
you
or
anybody
is
nice
as
mickey
an
i
to
be
i
to
be
but
you
see
i
laid
alone
all
day
in
a
dark
corner
so
long
an
i
got
so
wild
like
when
granny
did
come
i
done
an
said
jus
like
she
did
but
mickey
does
like
it
he
scairt
stiff
fear
i
forget
an
say
bad
swearin
an
you
send
me
back
to
the
hotness
so
i
wo
get
better
would
you
send
me
back
if
i
forget
peter
why
pshaw
now
said
peter
pshaw
little
soul
do
you
worry
about
that
you
try
to
remember
and
be
like
mickey
wants
you
to
and
if
you
make
a
slip
i
speak
to
ma
about
it
and
we
just
turn
a
deaf
ear
and
away
out
here
you
soon
forget
it
just
then
mickey
trailing
a
rope
passed
before
the
window
there
was
a
crunching
sound
a
lumbering
cow
stopped
lifted
a
mouth
half
filled
with
grass
and
bawled
her
loudest
protest
at
being
separated
from
her
calf
peaches
had
only
half
a
glance
but
her
shriek
was
utter
terror
she
launched
herself
on
peter
and
climbed
him
until
her
knees
were
on
his
chest
and
her
fingers
clutching
his
hair
god
jesus
she
screamed
it
eat
me
peter
caught
her
in
his
arms
turning
his
back
mickey
heard
and
saw
and
realized
that
the
cow
was
too
big
and
had
appeared
too
precipitately
and
bellowed
too
loudly
he
should
have
begun
on
the
smallest
calf
on
the
place
he
rushed
the
cow
back
to
junior
and
himself
to
peaches
who
sobbing
wildly
still
clung
to
peter
as
mickey
entered
frightened
and
despairing
he
saw
that
peter
was
much
concerned
but
laughing
until
his
shoulders
shook
and
in
relief
that
he
was
and
that
none
of
the
children
were
present
mickey
grinned
acquired
a
slow
red
and
tried
to
quiet
peaches
shut
that
window
she
screamed
shut
it
quick
why
honey
that
the
cow
you
wanted
to
see
soothed
mickey
the
nice
cow
that
gave
the
very
milk

mickey

peaches
wiped
her
eyes

at
the
window
and
still
clinging
to
mickey
explained
i

her
mickey

of

and
in
an
effort

her
back
to

and

still
so
your
back
will

and

the
bundle

night
peaches
shivered
in
delight
mickey
proceeded
slowly
followed
by
the
entire
family
mickey
it
so
big
she
marvelled
everything
is
so
far
away
so
big
now
is
it
agreed
mickey
you
see
it
like
i
told
you
now
let
me
show
you
the
garden
he
selected
that
as
a
safe
proposition
peaches
grasped
the
idea
readily
enough
harding
gathered
vegetables
for
her
to
see
when
they
reached
the
strawberry
bed
mickey
knelt
and
with
her
own
fingers
peaches
pulled
a
berry
and
ate
it
then
laughed
exclaimed
and
cried
in
delight
she
picked
a
flower
and
from
the
safe
vantage
of
the
garden
viewed
the
cows
and
horses
afar
and
the
fields
and
sheep
were
explained
to
her
mickey
carried
her
across
the
road
mary
brought
a
comfort
and
for
a
whole
hour
the
child
lay
under
a
big
tree
with
pink
and
white
clover
in
a
border
around
her
when
they
lifted
her
she
said
mickey
we
put
in
the
biggest
blesses
of
all
what
inquired
mickey
bless
the
nice
people
for
such
grand
things
an
the
berries
but
never
mind
about
the
cow
then
mickey
took
her
back
to
the
house
she
awoke
from
a
restful
nap
to
find
a
basket
of
chickens
waiting
for
her
barely
down
dry
from
their
shells
she
caught
up
a
little
yellow
ball
and
with
both
hands
clutched
it
exclaiming
and
crying
in
joy
until
mickey
saw
the
chicken
was
drooping
he
pried
open
her
excited
little
fingers
but
the
chicken
remained
limp
soon
it
became
evident
that
she
had
squeezed
the
life
from
it
oh
peaches
you
held
it
too
tight
wailed
mickey
i
afraid
made
it
sick
i
did
mean
to
mickey
she
protested
harding
reached
over
and
picked
the
chicken
from
mickey
fingers
that
chicken
was
very
well
to
begin
with
she
said
give
it
to
me
and
i
doctor
it
up
while
you
take
another
one
which
do
you
want
yellow
sniffed
peaches
but
please
hurry
and
mickey
you
hold
this
one

hard

laughed
peter
but
we
wanted
to

a
small
price

a
family
of
your
own
so
you
understand
what
mickey
asked
peter
oh
how
to
be
easy
with
little
sick
people
answered
mickey
and
that
a
man
family
is
family
and
he
do
want
anybody
else
butting
in
i
see
said
peter
struggling
with
his
facial
muscles
of
course
but
this
sheet
is
going
to
be
rather
bunglesome
ma
could
you
do
anything
about
it
yes
said
harding
mary
you
run
up
to
the
flannel
chest
and
get
bobbie
little
blue
blanket
peter
lifted
the
child
to
his
broad
breast
she
slipped
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
bloom
time
was
past
but
bird
time
was
not
while
the
leaves
were
still
freshly
green
and
tender
some
of
them
reached
to
touch
peaches
gold
hair
in
passing
she
was
held
high
to
see
into
nests
and
the
hollow
in
the
apple
tree
peaches
gripped
peter
and
cried
do
let
it
get
my
feet
when
the
old
turkey
gobbler
came
rasping
strutting
and
spitting
at
the
party
mickey
pointed
to
mary
who
was
unafraid
and
peaches
clutch
grew
less
frantic
but
she
defended
well
i
care
i
bet
if
she
had
ever
seen
one
before
an
then
a
big
thing
like
that
would
come
right
at
her
tellin
plain
it
was
goin
to
eat
her
alive
it
would
scare
the
livers
out
of
her
yes
i
guess
it
would
conceded
peter
but
you
got
the
eating
end
of
it
wrong
it
is
going
to
eat
us
we
are
going
to
eat
it
about
thanksgiving
we
lay
its
head
on
the
block
and
ma
will
stuff
it
i
quit
stuffing
turkeys
peter
said
harding
i
find
it
spoils
the
flavour
of
the
meat
well
then
it
will
stuff
us
said
peter
all
we
can
hold
and
mince
pie
plum
pudding
and
every
good
thing
we
can
think
of
what
piece
of
turkey
do
you
like
best
butterfly
mickey
instantly
scanned
peter
then
peter
and
tensely
waited
oh
stop
stop
is
a
turkey
bird
cried
peaches
surely
it
is
said
harding
why
childie
have
you
ever
seen
a
turkey
either
no
i
did
ever
said
peaches
can
turkey
birds
sing
just
then
the
gobbler
stuck
forward
his
head
and
sang
gehobble
hobble
hobble
peaches
gripped
peter
hair
and
started
to
ascend
him
again
harding
waved
her
apron
the
turkey
suddenly
reduced
its
size
skipped
aside
and
a
neat
trim
bird
high
stepping
and
dainty
walked
through
the
orchard
peaches
collapsed
in
arms
in
wonder
gosh
how
did
it
cave
in
like
that
she
cried
peter
shoulders
were
shaking
but
he
answered
gravely
well
that
a
way
it
has
of
puffing
itself
up
and
making
a
great
big
pretense
that
it
is
going
to
flop
us
and
then
if
just
little
bobbie
or
ma
waves
an
apron
or
a
stick
it
gets
out
of
the
way
in
a
hurry
i
seen
multiopolis
millyingaires
cave
in
like
that
sometimes
when
i
waved
a
morning
paper
with
an
headline
about
them
commented
mickey
peter
harding
glanced
at
his
wife
then
they
laughed
together
peter
stepped
over
a
snake
fence
went
carefully
down
a
hill
crossed
the
meadow
to
the
shade
of
a
tree
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
and
watched
peaches
as
she
studied
first
the
clear
babbling
water
then
the
grass
trailing
in
the
stream
the
bushes
trees
and
then
the
water
again
mickey
come
here
she
commanded
put
your
head
right
down
beside
mine
now
look
just
the
way
i
do
an
tell
me
what
you
see
i
see
running
water
grassy
banks
trees
the
birds
the
sky
and
the
clouds
the
water
shows
what
above
it
like
a
mirror
lily
peaches
pointed
mickey
watched
intently
sure
he
cried
little
fish
with
red
speckles
on
them
shall
i
catch
you
one
to
see
my
eyes
then
questioned
peaches
your
eyes
miss
asked
mickey
bewildered
my
eyes
seein
things
that
yours
does
mickey
took
her
hand
and
drew
closer
well
it
is
any
wonder
you
almost
doubt
it
honey
he
said
i
would
too
if
i
had
ever
seen
it
before
but
i
been
on
the
trolley
and
on
a
few
newsboys
excursions
and
in
the
car
with
bruce
and
i
got
to
walk
along
the
str
roads
some
so
i
know
it
real
let
me
show
you
mickey
slipped
down
the
bank
scooped
his
hands
full
of
water
and
lifted
them
letting
it
drip
through
his
fingers
then
he
made
a
sweep
and
brought
up
one
of
the
fish
brightly
marked
as
a
flower
and
gasping
in
the
air
look
quick
he
cried
see
it
good
it
used
to
water
and
the
air
chokes
it
just
like
the
water
would
you
if
a
big
fish
would
take
you
and
hold
your
head
under
i
got
to
put
it
back
quick
mickey
lay
it
in
my
hand
just
a
little
bit
mickey
obeyed
while
peaches
examined
it
hurriedly
put
it
back
she
cried
i
guess
that
as
long
as
i
want
to
be
choked
while
a
fish
looked
at
me
mickey
exchanged
the
fish
for
a
handful
of
wet
vividly
coloured
pebbles
then
brought
a
bunch
of
cowslips
yellow
as
gold
and
a
long
willow
whip
with
leaves
on
and
when
she
had
examined
these
she
looked
inquiringly
at
harding
nicest
lady
may
i
put
my
feet
in
your
water
how
about
the
temperature
of
it
mickey
inquired
harding
it
all
right
said
mickey
i
washed
her
in
colder
water
lots
of
times
the
sunshine
lady
said
i
should
to
toughen
her
up
then
go
ahead
said
harding
peter
may
i
asked
peaches
surely
agreed
peter
whole
bunch
may
get
in
if
ma
says
so
well
i
do
say
so
exclaimed
harding
the
children
have
their
good
clothes
on
and
they
always
get
to
romping
and
dirty
themselves
and
then
it
bigger
washings
and
mine
are
enough
to
break
my
back
right
now
peter
looked
at
his
wife
intently
why
nancy
i
had
heard
you
complain
before
he
said
if
they
too
big
we
must
wear
less
and
make
them
smaller
and
i
take
an
hour
at
the
machine
and
junior
can
turn
the
wringer
all
of
you
children
listen
to
me
your
ma
is
feeling
the
size
of
the
that
means
we
must
be
more
careful
of
our
clothes
and
help
her
better
if
ma
gets
sick
or
tired
of
us
we
be
in
a
fix
i
tell
you
i
did
say
i
was
sick
or
tired
of
you
i
just
tired
of
washing
said
harding
i
see
said
peter
but
it
is
a
thing
that
has
got
to
be
done
like
plowing
and
sowing
yes
i
know
said
harding
but
plowing
and
sowing
only
come
once
a
year
washing
comes
once
and
twice
a
week
let
me
said
mickey
i
always
helped
mother
and
i
do
my
own
and
lily
at
home
of
course
i
will
here
and
i
can
help
you
a
lot
with
yours
yes
a
boy
scoffed
harding
well
i
show
you
that
a
boy
can
work
as
well
as
a
girl
if
he
been
taught
right
said
mickey
i
was
bringing
up
any
question
of
work
said
harding
i
just
did
want
the
children
to
dirty
a
round
of
clothing
apiece
they
may
wade
when
their
things
are
ready
for
the
wash
anyway
go
on
peaches
peter
moved
down
the
bank
and
prepared
to
lower
her
to
the
water
but
she
reached
her
arms
for
mickey
he
promised
me
she
said
back
there
on
his
nice
bed
in
the
hot
room
he
promised
me
this
so
i
did
said
mickey
radiating
satisfaction
he
could
not
conceal
so
i
did
now
i
let
you
put
your
feet
in
like
i
said
will
the
fish
bite
me
she
questioned
timidly
those
little
things
what
if
they
did
thus
encouraged
she
put
her
toes
in
the
water
gripping
mickey
and
waiting
breathlessly
to
see
what
happened
nothing
happened
while
the
warm
running
water
felt
pleasant
so
she
dipped
lower
and
then
did
her
best
to
make
it
splash
it
was
much
of
a
splash
but
it
was
a
satisfying
performance
to
the
parties
most
interested
and
from
their
eagerness
the
watchers
understood
what
it
meant
to
them
junior
sidled
up
to
his
mother
ai
that
tough
he
whispered
she
bit
her
lip
and
silently
nodded
look
at
her
feet
will
you
he
breathed
she
looked
at
him
instead
then
suddenly
her
eyes
filled
with
a
mist
like
that
clouding
his
they
ever
walk
he
questioned
i
do
know
she
said
softly
but
it
looks
as
if
god
has
given
us
the
chance
to
make
them
if
it
possible
well
say
what
my
share
he
said
just
anything
you
see
that
you
think
will
help
if
i
be
more
careful
not
to
dirty
so
many
clothes
will
it
help
he
asked
it
would
leave
me
that
much
more
time
and
strength
to
give
to
her
she
said
will
all
i
can
save
you
in
any
way
be
helping
her
that
much
he
persisted
surely
she
said
soon
as
he
out
of
sight
i
going
to
begin
on
her
but
do
let
them
hear
junior
nodded
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
watching
as
if
fascinated
the
feet
trying
to
splash
in
the
water
mickey
could
feel
the
effort
of
the
small
body
you
take
her
now
he
said
to
peter
then
he
threw
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
turned
up
his
knee
breeches
and
stepped
into
the
water
where
he
helped
the
feet
to
kick
and
splash
he
rubbed
them
and
at
last
picked
up
handfuls
of
fine
sand
and
lightly
massaged
with
it
until
he
brought
a
pink
glow
that
the
stuff
indorsed
peter
look
at
that
you
pulling
the
blood
down
where
the
blood
asked
peaches
peter
explained
the
circulatory
system
and
why
all
the
years
of
lying
with
no
movement
had
made
her
so
helpless
he
told
her
why
scarce
and
wrong
food
had
not
made
good
blood
to
push
down
and
strengthen
her
feet
so
they
would
walk
he
told
her
the
friction
of
the
would
pull
it
down
while
the
sun
water
and
earth
would
help
peaches
with
wide
eyes
listened
her
breath
coming
faster
and
faster
until
suddenly
she
leaned
forward
and
cried
rub
mickey
rub
the
blood
flies
rub
hot
as
hell
well
miss
chicken
he
cried
in
despair
peaches
buried
her
shamed
face
on
peter
breast
he
screened
her
with
a
big
hand
now
never
you
mind
never
you
mind
he
repeated
everybody
turn
a
deaf
ear
that
was
a
slip
nobody
heard
it
you
mean
little
butterfly
white
hard
say
rub
hard
and
that
will
fix
it
mickey
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
so
subdued
and
contrite
as
to
be
ridiculous
wo
you
please
to
rub
hard
rub
jus
as
hard
mickey
suddenly
bent
to
kiss
the
bony
little
foot
he
was
chafing
yes
darling
i
rub
it
bleeds
he
said
when
the
feet
were
glowing
with
alternate
and
splashing
in
cold
water
peter
looked
at
his
wife
i
think
that
the
ticket
he
said
nancy
do
you
that
pulls
down
the
blood
with
rubbing
and
drives
it
back
with
cold
water
and
pulls
it
down
to
be
pushed
back
again
ai
that
helping
the
heart
get
in
its
work
now
if
we
strengthen
her
with
right
food
and
make
lots
of
pure
blood
to
run
in
these
little
blue
canals
on
her
temples
and
hands
and
feet
ai
we
gaining
ground
ai
we
making
headway
we
just
got
to
be
said
harding
there
no
other
way
to
figure
it
but
this
is
enough
for
a
start
peaches
leaned
toward
her
and
asked

do
this
again

mickey

something

as

a
bucket
of
sand
up
to
the
house
and

her

a
smile

acting
like

nice
lady
peaches
radiated
pride
while
peter
returned
her
to
the
couch
brought
her
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
cracker
pulled
the
shade
and
going
out
softly
closed
the
door
in
five
minutes
she
was
asleep
an
hour
before
supper
time
mickey
appeared
and
without
a
word
began
watching
harding
suddenly
her
work
lightened
when
she
was
ready
for
water
the
bucket
was
filled
saving
her
a
trip
to
the
pump
when
she
lifted
the
dishpan
and
started
toward
the
back
door
mickey
met
her
with
the
potato
basket
when
she
glanced
questioningly
at
the
stove
he
put
in
more
wood
he
went
to
the
and
set
the
table
exactly
as
it
had
been
for
dinner
he
made
the
trip
to
the
cellar
with
her
and
brought
up
bread
and
milk
while
she
carried
butter
and
preserves
as
she
told
peter
that
night
no
strange
woman
ever
had
helped
her
as
quickly
and
understandingly
with
dishwashing
he
was
on
hand
for
he
knew
that
peaches
fate
hung
on
how
much
additional
work
was
made
for
harding
that
surprised
woman
found
herself
seated
in
a
cool
place
on
the
back
porch
preparing
things
for
breakfast
while
mickey
washed
the
dishes
and
mary
carried
them
peaches
was
moved
to
the
couch
in
the
where
she
could
look
on
then
wrapped
in
bobbie
blanket
and
held
closely
in
mickey
arms
the
child
lay
quivering
with
delight
while
the
big
car
made
the
trip
to
the
club
house
and
stopped
under
the
trees
to
show
peaches
where
bruce
played
and
then
slowly
ran
along
the
country
road
with
all
its
occupants
talking
at
once
in
their
effort
to
point
out
everything
to
her
no
one
realized
how
tired
she
was
until
in
calling
her
attention
to
a
colt
beside
its
mother
she
made
no
response
then
it
was
discovered
that
she
was
asleep
so
they
took
her
home
and
put
her
to
bed
chapter
xvi
fingers
in
the
when
mickey
went
the
following
morning
to
bring
water
for
the
inevitable
washing
harding
said
to
him
is
it
possible
that
child
is
awake
this
early
no
she
is
sleeping
like
she
never
come
to
said
mickey
i
wait
the
last
minute
before
i
touch
her
you
should
wake
her
said
harding
but
i
must
said
mickey
i
ca
go
away
and
leave
her
not
washed
fed
and
fixed
the
best
i
can
of
course
i
understand
that
said
harding
but
now
different
then
you
were
forced
this
is
merely
a
question
of
what
is
best
for
her
now
mickey
we
all
worked
up
over
this
till
we
most
beside
ourselves
so
we
want
to
help
suppose
you
humour
us
by
letting
us
please
ourselves
a
trifle
how
does
that
proposition
strike
you
square
from
the
ground
up
answered
mickey
promptly
but
what
would
please
you
well
said
harding
it
would
please
me
to
keep
this
house
quiet
and
let
that
child
sleep
till
the
demands
of
her
satisfied
body
wake
her
up
then
i
love
to
bathe
her
as
a
woman
would
her
own
in
like
case
and
cook
her
such
dainties
as
she
should
have
things
with
lots
of
lime
in
them
i
think
her
bones
have
been
built
right
i
believe
i
could
make
her
fifty
per
cent
better
in
three
months
myself
and
as
far
as
taking
her
away
when
this
week
is
up
you
might
as
well
begin
to
make
different
plans
right
now
if
she
does
well
here
and
likes
it
she
ca
be
taken
back
where
i
found
her
till
cool
weather
if
i
can
get
the
consent
of
my
mind
to
let
her
go
then
of
course
i
know
she
yours
so
things
will
be
as
you
say
but
think
a
while
before
you
go
against
me
if
i
do
all
i
can
for
her
i
ought
to
earn
the
privilege
of
having
my
finger
in
the
pie
a
little
bit
so
far
as
lily
goes
said
mickey
i
be
tickled
to
death
i
ai
anxious
to
pull
and
haul
and
wake
up
the
poor
little
sleepy
thing
every
morning
it
makes
me
sick
i
a
lot
rather
let
her
sleep
it
out
as
you
say
but
while
lily
is
mine
and
i
got
to
do
the
best
by
her
i
can
you
are
peter
so
he
must
do
the
best
by
you
he
can
and
did
you
notice
how
he
jumped
on
that
washing
business
yesterday
how
we
going
to
square
up
with
peter
i
perfectly
willing
to
do
what
i
said
for
the
sake
of
that
child
i
come
to
be
mighty
fond
of
you
mickey
in
the
little
time
known
you
if
i
did
like
and
want
to
help
peaches
i
do
a
lot
for
her
just
to
please
you
gee
you
something
grand
cried
mickey
just
common
clay
commonest
kind
of
clay
mickey
said
harding
but
if
you
want
to
know
how
you
could
it
with
me
which
will
it
with
peter
i
tell
you
you
may
think
i
silly
but
as
we
made
we
made
and
this
is
how
it
is
with
me
of
course
i
love
peter
my
children
my
home
and
i
love
my
work
but
i
had
this
job
without
or
tittle
of
change
for
fifteen
years
and
i
about
stalled
with
the
sameness
of
it
i
know
you
think
i
crazy
i
wo
interrupted
mickey
you
go
on
and
tell
me
the
sameness
of
it
is
getting
you
and
just
the
way
you
flew
around
and
did
things
last
night
perfectly
amazed
me
i
never
saw
a
boy
like
you
before
you
helped
me
better
and
with
more
sense
than
any
woman
i
ever
hired
and
thinking
it
over
last
night
i
said
to
myself
if
mickey
would
be
willing
to
trade
jobs
with
me
it
would
give
me
a
change
and
it
would
be
any
more
work
for
him
than
what
he
doing
well
never
you
mind
about
the
work
part
of
it
said
mickey
that
does
cut
any
ice
with
me
it
men
work
to
eat
and
i
know
who
made
a
law
that
it
was
any
more
work
to
cook
for
men
than
it
is
their
own
if
there
a
law
of
that
kind
i
bet
a
the
made
it
i
have
had
my
show
at
yet
but
when
i
get
it
there
are
some
things
i
can
see
right
now
that
i
going
to
fix
for
lily
and
i
sooner
fix
them
for
you
too
than
not
just
were
you
thinking
harding
went
to
mickey
took
him
by
the
shoulder
turned
him
toward
the
back
door
and
piloted
him
to
the
porch
where
she
pointed
east
indicating
an
open
line
it
began
as
high
as
his
head
against
the
side
of
the
harding
back
wall
and
ran
straight
it
crossed
the
yard
between
trees
that
through
no
design
at
all
happened
to
stand
in
line
with
those
of
the
orchard
so
that
they
formed
a
narrow
emerald
wall
on
each
side
of
a
space
that
led
to
the
meadow
where
it
widened
ran
down
hill
and
crossed
lush
grass
where
cattle
grazed
then
it
climbed
a
far
hill
tree
crested
cloud
capped
and
in
a
mist
of
glory
the
faint
red
of
the
rising
sun
worked
colour
miracles
with
the
edges
of
cloud
rims
tinted
them
with
flushes
of
rose
lavender
streaks
of
vivid
red
and
a
broad
stripe
of
pale
green
alone
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
stood
one
giant
old
apple
tree
the
remains
of
an
orchard
it
was
widely
branching
symmetrically
outlined
backed
and
coloured
by
cloud
wonder
above
and
around
it
the
woman
pointed
down
the
avenue
with
a
shaking
finger
and
asked
see
that
mickey
start
slow
and
get
all
of
it
every
time
i
stepped
on
this
back
porch
for
fifteen
years
summer
or
winter
i
seen
that
just
as
it
is
now
or
as
it
was
three
weeks
ago
when
the
world
was
blooming
or
as
it
will
be
in
the
red
and
gold
of
fall
or
the
later
grays
and
browns
and
when
it
ice
coated
and
the
sun
comes
up
i
think
sometimes
it
will
kill
me
i
neglected
my
work
to
stand
staring
many
the
time
in
summer
and
i
taken
more
than
one
chill
in
winter
i
tried
to
show
peter
and
a
few
times
i
suggested
he
ought
to
have
seen
for
himself
that
you
should
have
had
a
window
cut
there
the
first
thing
said
mickey
well
he
did
and
he
does
said
harding
but
mickey
for
fifteen
years
has
been
a
single
morning
when
i
went
to
the
back
porch
for
and
you
ought
to
have
had
water
inside
fifteen
years
ago
cried
mickey
so
i
had
exclaimed
harding
and
come
to
think
of
it
i
mentioned
to
peter
over
and
over
too
but
mickey
what
i
started
to
say
was
that
i
been
perfectly
possessed
to
follow
that
path
and
watch
the
sun
rise
while
sitting
under
that
apple
tree
and
never
yet
have
i
got
to
the
place
where
there
was
bread
or
churning
or
a
baby
or
visitors
or
a
wash
or
ironing
or
some
reason
why
i
could
go
maybe
i
a
fool
but
sure
as
you
a
foot
high
i
got
to
take
that
trip
pretty
soon
now
or
my
family
is
going
to
see
trouble
and
last
night
thinking
it
over
for
the
thousandth
time
i
said
to
myself
since
he
so
handy
if
he
keep
things
going
just
one
morning
just
one
morning
mickey
handed
her
a
sun
hat
he
said
gruffly
i
do
your
work
and
i
do
it
right
lily
can
have
her
sleep
the
woman
hesitated
a
second
pushed
away
the
hat
took
her
bearings
and
crossed
the
walk
heading
directly
toward
the
old
apple
tree
on
the
far
crest
her
eyes
were
set
on
the
rising
sun
and
as
she
turned
to
close
the
yard
gate
mickey
could
see
that
there
was
an
awed
unnatural
expression
on
her
face
he
stepped
into
the
by
the
time
peter
and
junior
came
with
big
buckets
of
milk
mickey
had
the
cream
separator
rinsed
and
together
as
he
had
helped
harding
fix
it
the
day
before
with
his
first
glance
peter
inquired
where
ma
she
doing
something
she
been
crazy
to
for
fifteen
years
answered
mickey
calmly
as
he
set
the
gauge
and
poured
in
the
first
bucket
of
milk
which
ai
answering
where
she
is
so
said
mickey
starting
the
machine
well
if
you
line
up
i
show
you
train
your
peepers
down
that
green
subway
and
on
out
to
glory
as
presented
by
the
almighty
in
this
particular
stretch
of
country
and
just
beyond
your
cows
there
you
see
a
spot
about
as
big
as
bobbie
and
that
will
be
your
nice
lady
heading
straight
for
sunrise
she
said
she
wanted
to
go
for
fifteen
years
but
there
always
had
been
churning
or
baking
or
something
so
this
morning
as
there
was
a
thing
but
what
i
could
do
as
good
as
she
could
why
we
made
it
up
that
i
finish
her
work
and
let
her
see
her
sunrise
since
she
seems
to
be
set
on
it
and
when
she
gets
back
she
going
to
wash
and
dress
lily
for
a
strange
how
women
folks
get
discouraged
on
their
job
among
their
best
friends
who
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
them
just
to
see
that
a
little
bit
of
change
would
help
them
it
will
be
a
dandy
scheme
for
lily
it
lets
her
get
her
sleep
out
and
it
will
be
good
for
you
if
harding
does
get
to
sit
under
that
apple
tree
and
watch
sunup
pretty
soon
things
are
going
to
go
wrong
at
this
house
peter
lower
jaw
slowly
sagged
if
you
do
hurry
said
mickey
even
loving
her
like
you
do
and
loving
you
as
she
does
she
going
to
have
them
nervous
prostrations
like
the
swell
dames
in
multiopolis
get
when
they
ask
a
fellow
to
carry
a
package
and
ca
remember
where
they
want
to
send
it
she
not
there
she
ahead
of
them
now
for
she
to
sit
under
that
apple
tree
and
watch
sunup
but
if
she
had
got
there
this
morning
or
soon
now
she
to
get
mixed
i
could
see
that
plain
as
the
city
hall
mickey
what
else
can
you
see
asked
peter
enough
to
make
your
head
swim
said
mickey
out
with
it
ordered
peter
well
said
mickey
gravely
and
seemingly
intent
on
the
separator
but
covertly
watching
peter
well
if
you
that
window
she
wanted
for
fifteen
years
right
over
her
table
there
where
the
line
comes
she
would
seeing
that
particular
bit
of
glory
you
notice
peter
that
probably
there
nothing
niftier
on
earth
than
just
the
little
spot
she
been
pining
for
look
good
yourself
and
you
see
there
she
just
climbing
the
hill
to
the
apple
tree
look
at
it
carefully
and
then
step
inside
and
focus
on
what
she
faced
instead
what
else
does
she
want
inquired
peter
she
did
mention
anything
but
to
watch
sunup
just
once
under
that
apple
tree
said
mickey
i
do
know
she
wants
but
from
one
day
here
i
could
tell
you
things
she
have
well
go
ahead
and
tell
said
peter
will
you
agree
not
to
break
my
neck
i
get
this
cream
in
the
can
and
what
she
keeps
strained
and
these
buckets
washed
asked
mickey
i
want
to
have
her
job
all
done
when
she
gets
back
i
promised
her
and
that
quite
a
hike
she
taking
well
i
was
for
a
minute
but
i
might
as
well
hold
myself
said
peter
looks
like
you
were
right
strangers
coming
in
can
always
see
things
that
folks
on
the
job
ca
consoled
mickey
well
go
on
and
tell
me
what
you
seen
here
mickey
mickey
hoisted
the
fourth
bucket
well
i
seen
the
very
nicest
lady
i
ever
saw
excepting
my
mother
said
mickey
i
seen
a
man
your
size
that
i
like
better
than
any
man
i
know
barring
douglas
bruce
and
the
bar
is
such
a
little
one
it
would
take
a
microscope
to
find
it
peter
laughed
which
was
what
mickey
hoped
he
would
do
for
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
went
on
with
greater
assurance
i
seen
a
place
that
i
thought
was
a
new
edition
of
heaven
and
it
is
only
it
needs
a
few
modern
improvements
yes
mickey
the
window
and
what
else
you
have
looked
at
what
i
told
you
to
about
the
window
yet
said
mickey
well
since
you
insist
on
it
i
will
said
peter
and
while
you
are
in
there
suggested
mickey
after
you
finish
with
that
strip
of
brown
oilcloth
and
the
pans
and
skillets
adorning
it
cotton
up
to
that
cook
stove
and
imagine
standing
over
it
while
it
is
roaring
to
get
three
meals
a
day
and
all
the
baking
fruit
canning
boiling
clothes
and
such
and
tell
me
if
lily
bed
was
in
so
much
hotter
a
place
than
your
wife
is
all
but
about
three
hours
each
day
mickey
listened
as
intently
as
he
could
for
the
separator
he
dared
not
stop
heard
not
a
sound
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
and
then
came
amazing
ones
he
grinned
sympathetically
as
peter
emerged
red
faced
and
raging
and
you
about
the
finest
man
i
ever
met
too
commented
mickey
still
busy
with
the
cream
you
can
see
what
a
comfort
this
separator
must
be
but
it
the
thing
your
nice
lady
has
got
against
so
many
for
your
work
it
takes
quite
a
large
building
to
keep
them
in
junior
was
showing
me
last
night
and
telling
me
what
all
those
machines
were
made
for
you
know
peter
if
there
was
money
for
a
hay
rake
and
a
manure
spreader
and
a
wheel
plow
and
a
disk
and
a
reaper
and
a
mower
and
a
corn
planter
and
a
corn
cutter
and
a
cider
press
and
a
windmill
and
a
silo
and
an
automobile
you
know
peter
there
have
been
enough
for
that
window
and
the
pump
inside
and
a
kitchen
sink
and
a
and
a
and
if
there
was
any
other
single
thing
there
ought
to
be
some
way
you
sell
the
wood
and
use
the
money
for
the
kind
of
a
summer
stove
that
only
hot
under
what
you
are
cooking
and
turns
off
the
flame
the
minute
you
finish
honest
there
had
peter
i
got
a
little
gasoline
one
in
my
room
that
better
than
what
your
nice
lady
has
the
things
she
should
have
would
cost
something
cost
a
lot
for
all
i
know
but
i
bet
what
she
needs
take
half
the
things
in
the
building
junior
showed
me
did
and
it
could
be
the
start
of
what
a
sick
wife
and
doctor
bills
and
strange
women
coming
and
going
and
abusing
you
and
the
children
would
cost
shut
up
cried
peter
that
will
do
now
you
listen
to
me
young
man
since
you
are
so
expert
at
seeing
things
and
since
you
traded
work
with
my
wife
to
by
her
suppose
you
just
keep
your
eyes
open
and
make
out
a
list
of
what
she
should
have
to
do
her
work
convenient
and
easy
as
can
be
and
of
course
comfortably
that
stove
hot
yet
and
breakfast
been
over
an
hour
too
nothing
like
it
must
be
going
full
blast
and
things
steaming
and
frying
sure
said
mickey
watch
a
few
days
and
then
we
talk
it
over
if
it
is
your
train
time
ride
down
with
junior
and
i
stay
in
the
house
till
she
comes
i
guess
little
white
butterfly
wo
wake
up
and
if
she
does
be
all
right
with

our
secret
answered
peter
gravely
mickey
took
one
long
look
at
peaches
and
went
running
to
the
milk
wagon
junior
offered
to
let
him
drive
so
for
the
first
time
he
took
the
lines
and
guided
a
horse
he
was
a
happy
boy
as
he
spun
on
his
heel
waiting
a
few
minutes
for
the
trolley
he
sat
in
the
car
with
no
paper
in
which
to
search
for
headlines
no
anxiety
as
to
whether
he
could
dispose
of
enough
to
keep
peaches
from
hunger
that
night
sure
of
her
safety
and
comfort
the
future
coloured
by
what
harding
had
said
to
him
took
on
such
a
rosy
glow
it
almost
hurt
his
mental
eyes
he
revelled
in
greater
freedom
from
care
than
he
ever
had
known
he
sat
straighter
and
curiously
watched
the
people
in
the
car
when
they
entered
the
city
and
the
car
swung
down
his
street
near
the
business
centre
mickey
stepped
off
and
hiding
himself
watched
for
the
passing
of
the
boy
on
his
old
route
before
long
it
came
i
to
sell
papers
in
such
good
imitation
of
his
tone
and
call
that
mickey
face
grew
grave
and
a
little
ache
began
in
his
heart
course
we
better
off
he
commented
course
i
ca
go
back
now
and
i
would
if
i
could
but
it
makes
me
want
to
swat
any
fellow
using
my
call
and
taking
my
men
gee
the
kid
is
doing
better
than
i
thought
he
could
he
got
the
idea
all
right
i
just
join
the
procession
mickey
stepped
into
line
and
followed
pausing
whenever
a
paper
was
sold
until
he
was
sure
that
his
men
were
patronizing
his
substitute
then
he
overtook
him
good
work

applauded

following

asked
the
boy

shouted
holding
his
side
with
one
hand
and
waving
a
paper
with
the
other
all
the
old
boys
hiking
to
the
beauty
parlours
pinking
up

glow
of

when
the
policemen
scattered
the
crowd
mickey
substitute
had
not
a
paper
remaining
with
his
pocket
full
of
change
he
was
running
to
the
nearest
stand
for
a
fresh
supply
mickey
went
with
him
and
watched
with
critical
eye
while
the
boy
tried
a
reproduction
of
what
he
called
a
daily
scream
the
first
time
it
was
rather
flat
you
ai
going
at
it
right
explained
mickey
you
can
make
anybody
laugh
on
this
job
you
must
see
the
fun
of
life
yourself
beauty
parlours
have
always
been
for
the
swell
dames
and
the
theatre
ladies
who
pink
up
while
their
gents
hump
to
pay
the
bill
you
ought
always
take
one
paper
home
and
it
so
you
know
what
going
on
in
the
world
now
from
what
i
read
i
know
that
the
of
the
beauty
parlours
is
cold
cream
and
one
of
the
show
ladies
the
boys
are
always
wild
over
told
the
papers
long
ago
how
she
used
icicles
on
her
face
to
pink
it
up
now
if
you
this
like
you
should
the
minute
you
clapped
your
peepers
on
that
wrinkles
where
your
laugh
came
in
today
like
i
told
you
over
and
over
you
get
it
bet
chaffner
put
that
there
on
purpose
for
me
which
same
gives
me
an
idea
you
been
calling
the
hoc
de
geezer
war
and
the
champeen
of
mexico
and
psychological
something
fine
but
did
you
sell
out
on
them
not
on
your
topknot
you
lost
your
load
on
the
scream
the
joke
of
life
soaked
in
your
system
on
this
you
make
yourself
see
the
plutes
and
the
magnates
and
the
city
officials
leaving
their
jobs
and
hiking
to
the
beauty
parlours
to
beat
the
dames
at
their
daily
stunt
of
being
creamed
and
icicled
and
it
funny
when
it
so
funny
to
you
that
you
just
howl
about
it
why
it
catching
did
you
see
me
catch
them
with
it
now
go
on
and
do
it
again
and
get
the
in
the
boy
began
the
cry
with
tears
of
laughter
in
his
eyes
he
kept
it
up
as
he
handed
out
papers
and
took
in
change
satisfied
mickey
called
to
him
tell
your
sire
it
all
over
but
polishing
the
silver
he
started
down
the
street
glancing
at
clocks
he
was
passing
with
nimble
feet
threading
the
crowds
until
he
reached
the
office
there
he
dodged
in
and
making
his
way
to
the
editorial
desk
he
waited
his
chance
when
he
saw
an
instant
of
pause
in
the
work
of
the
busy
man
he
started
his
cry
morning
papers
i
to
sell
them
and
so
on
to
the
chasing
wrinkles
there
because
he
was
excited
for
he
knew
that
his
reception
would
depend
on
how
good
a
laugh
he
gave
them
mickey
outdid
himself
reporters
waiting
assignments
crowded
around
him
chaffner
beckoned
and
mickey
stepped
to
him
found
it
all
right
did
you
young
man
the
scream
lifted
the
load
cried
mickey
war
and
waste
and
wickedness
did
get
a
look
in
i
thought
you
like
that
laughed
the
editor
biggest
scoop
yet
said
mickey
why
it
took
the
police
to
scatter
the
crowd
they
struggled
to
get
papers
they
looked
like
the
bird
on
the
coin
they
were
passing
in
trying
to
escape
the
awful
things
it
goes
through
on
the
money
and
get
back
to
nature
where
perfectly
good
birds
belong
honest
they
did
have
you
any
poetry
for
me
yet
no
but
i
headed
that
way
answered
mickey
how
so
inquired
the
editor
why
i
got
another
kid
so
he
can
do
my
stunt
nobody
knows
the
difference
and
i
gone
into
bruce
office
and
we
after
the
grafters
douglas
bruce
queried
chaffner
yes
said
mickey
he
my
boss
and
say
he
the
finest
man
you
ever
met
and
his
joy
lady
is
nice
as
he
is
and
prettier
than
moonshine
on
the
park
lake
i
never
saw
a
lady
who
could
hold
a
candle
to
miss
leslie
winton
and
they
just
love
to
tell
folks
engaged
suddenly
the
editor
arose
from
his
chair
gripped
his
desk
leaned
across
it
toward
mickey
and
almost
knocked
him
from
his
feet
with
one
word
mickey
staggered
at
last
he
recovered
his
breath
bruce
and
miss
leslie
do
care
if
i
tell
he
defended
they
all
the
time
tell
it
why
that
they
are
going
to
be
married
soon
as
bruce
gets
the
grafter
who
robbing
the
taxpayers
of
multiopolis
and
collects
his
big
fee
that
what
as
suddenly
as
he
had
arisen
chaffner
dropped
back
and
in
a
stupefied
way
still
looked
at
mickey
then
you
come
with
me
chaffner
said
rising
and
he
entered
a
small
room
and
closed
the
door
now
you
tell
me
all
about
this
engagement
maybe
they
do
want
it
in
the
papers
yet
said
mickey
i
guess
i
let
bruce
do
his
own
talking
but
you
said
they
told
everybody
so
they
do
said
mickey
and
of
course
they
tell
you
you
can
call
him
his
number
is
the
editor
made
a
note
of
it
studying
mickey
yes
that
would
be
the
better
way
of
course
he
agreed
you
have
a
long
head
young
man
and
so
you
think
miss
leslie
winton
is
a
fine
young
lady
surest
thing
you
know
said
mickey
why
let
me
tell
you
and
then
in
a
few
swift
words
mickey
sketched
in
the
young
woman
so
intelligent
she
had
selected
him
from
all
the
other
newsies
by
a
description
and
sent
him
to
bruce
how
she
had
dolls
ready
to
give
away
and
poor
children
might
ride
in
her
car
how
she
lived
with
darling
old
daddy
and
there
mickey
grew
enthusiastic
and
told
of
the
rest
house
and
then
the
renting
of
the
cabin
on
atwater
by
the
most
considerate
of
daughters
for
her
father
and
her
lover
and
when
he
could
not
think
of
another
commendatory
word
to
say
mickey
paused
while
a
dazed
man
muttered
a
word
so
low
the
boy
scarcely
heard
it
i
do
know
why
you
say
cried
mickey
ommh
said
chaffner
slowly
i
do
either
only
i
understand
they
were
it
my
business
to
find
and
distribute
news
and
get
it
fresh
it
as
our
term
is
and
so
mickey
when
investigations
are
going
on
and
everybody
knows
a
denou
a
big
surprise
is
coming
in
order
to
make
sure
that
my
paper
gets
in
on
the
ground
floor
i
make
some
investigation
for
myself
and
sometimes
by
accident
sometimes
by
intuition
sometimes
by
sharp
deduction
we
to
land
before
the
investigators
of
course
we
have
personal
financial
and
political
reasons
for
not
spoiling
the
game
now
we
have
gone
into
the
city
hall
investigation
as
bruce
has
and
we
show
figures
but
we
know
enough
to
understand
where
he
coming
out
so
when
the
gig
upsets
we
have
our
side
ready
and
we
embroider
his
figures
with
what
the
public
is
entitled
to
in
the
way
of
news
sure
but
i
do
see
why
you
act
so
funny
oh
it
barely
possible
that
i
got
ahead
of
your
boss
on
a
few
features
of
his
investigation
said
mickey
well
i
hope
you
ai
going
to
rush
in
and
spoil
scoop
you
see
he
does
know
who
he
after
himself
we
talk
about
it
a
lot
of
times
i
tell
him
how
i
sold
papers
and
seen
men
like
he
chasing
get
their
dose
and
go
sick
and
white
and
ever
face
men
straight
again
but
he
says
stealing
is
stealing
and
cut
where
it
will
those
who
rob
the
taxpayers
must
be
exposed
i
told
him
maybe
he
be
surprised
and
maybe
he
be
sorry
but
he
says
it
got
to
be
stopped
no
matter
who
gets
hurt
well
he
got
his
nerve
cried
the
editor
yes
agreed
mickey
he
so
fine
himself
he
thinks
no
other
men
worth
saving
could
go
wrong
i
told
him
i
wished
the
men
he
was
after
would
break
their
necks
he
gets
them
but
he
goes
right
on
mickey
you
figure
closer
than
your
boss
does
in
one
way
i
conceded
mickey
it
like
this
he
knows
books
and
men
and
how
things
be
but
i
know
how
they
see
i
certainly
see
said
the
intent
listener
mickey
when
it
comes
to
the
place
where
you
think
you
know
better
than
your
boss
while
bad
business
for
me
to
tell
you
keep
your
eye
open
and
maybe
you
can
save
him
books
and
theories
are
all
right
but
there
are
times
when
a
man
comes
a
cropper
on
them
you
watch
and
if
you
think
he
riding
for
a
fall
you
come
skinning
and
tell
me
not
over
the
and
tell
here
take
this
it
will
get
you
to
me
any
time
no
matter
where
i
am
or
what
i
doing
understand
you
think
bruce
is
going
to
get
into
trouble
his
job
is
to
get
other
people
into
trouble
but
he
says
he
ai
got
a
thing
to
do
with
it
said
mickey
he
says
they
get
themselves
into
trouble
that
so
too
commented
chaffner
anyway
keep
your
mouth
tight
shut
and
your
eyes
wide
open
and
if
you
think
your
boss
is
getting
into
deep
water
you
come
and
tell
me
i
want
things
to
go
right
with
because
i
depending
on
that
poem
for
my
front
page
soon
mickey
held
out
his
hand
sure
he
agreed
i
in
an
awful
good
place
now
to
work
up
the
poetry
piece
being
right
out
among
the
cows
and
clover
and
about
bruce
gee
i
wish
he
was
plowing
corn
i
just
hate
his
job
he
doing
now
sure
if
i
see
rocks
i
make
a
run
for
you
thanks
boss
mickey
had
lost
time
and
he
hurried
but
things
seemed
to
be
happening
for
as
he
left
the
elevator
and
sped
down
the
hall
he
ran
into
james
minturn
with
a
hasty
glance
he
drew
back
and
darted
for
the
office
door
minturn
face
turned
a
dull
red
one
minute
young
man
he
called
i
late
said
mickey
shortly
i
must
hurry
bruce
is
late
too
i
just
came
from
his
office
and
he
is
there
answered
minturn
well
i
want
to
get
it
in
order
before
he
comes
in
fact
you
want
anything
but
to
have
a
word
to
say
to
me
hazarded
minturn
well
then
since
you
are
such
a
good
guesser
i
ai
just
crazy
about
you
said
mickey
shortly
and
i
tired
of
having
you
run
from
me
as
if
i
were
afflicted
with
smallpox
said
minturn
if
your
blood
is
right
smallpox
ai
much
said
mickey
i
a
picture
of
myself
running
from
if
it
really
wanted
a
word
with
me
but
you
have
a
picture
of
yourself
running
from
me
maybe
i
do
conceded
mickey
i
noticed
it
on
occasions
so
frequent
and
conspicuous
that
others
no
doubt
will
do
the
same
said
minturn
if
you
are
all
bruce
thinks
you
then
you
should
give
a
man
credit
for
what
he
tries
to
do
you
surprised
me
too
deeply
for
words
with
the
story
you
brought
me
one
day
i
knew
most
of
your
facts
from
experience
better
than
you
did
except
the
one
horrible
thing
that
shocked
me
speechless
but
mickey
when
i
had
time
to
adjust
myself
i
made
the
investigations
you
suggested
and
proved
what
you
said
i
deserve
your
scorn
for
not
acting
faster
but
what
i
had
to
do
could
be
done
in
a
day
and
for
the
boys
sake
it
had
to
be
done
as
privately
as
possible
there
no
longer
any
reason
why
you
should
regard
me
as
a
monster
i
awful
glad
you
told
me
mickey
said
i
surely
did
have
you
sized
up
something
scandalous
and
yet
i
could
quite
make
out
how
if
my
view
was
right
bruce
and
miss
leslie
would
think
so
much
of
you
they
are
friends
i
proud
to
have
said
minturn
and
i
hope
you
consider
being
a
friend
to
me
and
to
my
boys
also
if
ever
a
times
comes
when
i
can
do
anything
for
you
let
me
know
now
right
on
that
point
pause
a
moment
said
mickey
you
a
friend
to
my
boss
i
certainly
am
and
i
under
deep
obligations
to
miss
winton
if
ever
my
home
becomes
once
more
what
it
was
to
start
with
it
will
be
her
work
could
a
man
bear
heavier
obligation
than
that
well
hardly
said
mickey
course
there
would
likely
ever
be
anything
you
could
do
for
miss
leslie
that
would
square
deal
but
i
worried
about
my
boss
something
awful
why
mickey
asked
minturn
that
investigation
you
started
him
on
i
did
start
him
on
that
what
the
matter
well
the
returns
are
about
all
in
said
mickey
and
the
man
who
draws
the
candy
suit
is
about
ready
to
put

minturn
you

i
started
bruce
on
this
trying
to
help
him
to
a
case
that
would
bring
him
into
prominence
so
if
it
should
go
wrong
it
in
a
way
through
me
if
you
think
douglas
is
unlike
himself
or
worried
will
you
tell
me
will
you
why
surest
thing
you
know
cried
mickey
why
i
should
say
i
would
gee
you
great
too
i
think
i
like
you
awful
well
when
we
get
acquainted
mickey
was
busy
when
bruce
entered
and
with
him
was
leslie
winton
they
brought
the
breath
of
spring
mellowing
into
summer
freighted
with
emanations
of
real
love
touched
and
tinctured
with
joy
so
habitual
it
had
become
spontaneous
on
the
part
of
leslie
winton
and
this
morning
contagious
with
douglas
bruce
mickey
stood
silent
watched
them
closely
and
listened
so
in
three
minutes
from
ragged
scraps
and
ejaculations
effervescing
from
what
was
running
over
in
their
brains
he
knew
that
they
had
taken
an
early
morning
plunge
into
atwater
landed
a
black
bass
had
a
breakfast
of
their
own
making
at
least
in
so
far
as
gathering
wild
red
raspberries
from
the
sand
pit
near
the
bridge
and
then
they
had
raced
to
the
multiopolis
station
to
start
winton
on
a
trip
west
to
try
to
sell
his
interest
in
some
large
land
holdings
there
the
care
of
which
he
was
finding
burdensome
heavens
how
i
hope
daddy
makes
that
sale
cried
leslie
i
been
so
worried
about
him
this
summer
i
wondered
at
you
not
going
with
him
said
douglas
he
did
seem
to
want
me
said
leslie
he
said
it
was
a
flying
trip
and
he
was
forced
to
be
back
before
some
reports
from
his
office
were
filed
so
he
thought
i
would
enjoy
it
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
he
told
me
distinctly
that
he
did
have
for
me
fancy
daddy
i
ca
understand
it
i
noticed
that
he
has
been
brooding
and
preoccupied
of
late
not
at
all
like
himself
said
douglas
have
you
any
idea
what
troubles
him
of
course
he
told
me
said
leslie
it
swain
when
daddy
was
a
boy
swain
was
his
father
best
friend
and
when
grandfather
died
he
asked
him
to
guide
daddy
and
he
not
only
did
that
but
he
opened
his
purse
and
started
him
in
business
now
swain
is
growing
old
and
some
of
his
investments
have
gone
wrong
just
when
political
changes
made
business
close
as
could
be
he
lost
heavily
and
then
came
the
war
there
was
no
way
but
for
daddy
to
stay
here
and
fight
to
save
what
he
could
for
him
he
told
me
early
last
fall
we
talked
of
it
again
in
the
winter
and
this
spring
most
of
all
i
told
you
yes
i
know
i
wish
i
could
help
said
douglas
i
do
too
i
wish
it
intensely
said
leslie
when
father
comes
ask
him
we
young
and
strong
and
we
should
stand
by
i
never
saw
daddy
in
such
a
state
he
sell
that
land
he
so
he
said
last
night
he
be
forced
to
sell
if
he
only
got
half
its
value
and
that
would
be
enough
enough
for
what
asked
douglas
to
help
swain
said
leslie
he
going
to
use
his
fortune
queried
douglas
i
do
know
that
daddy
has
holdings
large
enough
to
deserve
the
word
said
leslie
he
going
to
use
what
he
has
i
urged
him
to
it
all
he
can
do
did
you
take
into
consideration
that
it
may
end
in
his
failure
asked
douglas
i
did
said
leslie
and
i
forgot
to
tell
him
but
i
will
as
soon
as
he
comes
back
he
can
have
all
mother
left
me
too
if
he
needs
it
leslie
you
a
darling
but
have
you
ever
had
even
a
small
taste
of
poverty
asked
douglas
no
but
i
always
been
curious
if
i
did
have
to
see
if
i
so
manage
whatever
might
be
my
share
that
it
would
appear
to
the
world
without
that
peculiar
state
of
grime
which
always
seems
to
distinguish
it
said
the
girl
i
not
afraid
of
poverty
and
i
not
afraid
of
work
it
dishonour
that
would
kill
me
daddy
accepted
obligations
if
they
involve
him
which
includes
me
also
then
to
the
last
cent
we
possess
we
pay
back
mickey
drew
the
duster
he
handled
between
vacuum
days
across
a
table
and
steadily
watched
first
douglas
then
leslie
both
of
whom
had
forgotten
him
that
should
be
good
enough
for
daddy
what
about
me
asked
douglas
if
ever
i
get
in
a
close
place
does
the
same
hold
good
if
i
know
what
you
are
doing
surely
i
knew
you
were
a
of
morning
first
time
i
saw
you
said
douglas
but
we
are
forgetting
mickey
mickey
promptly
stepped
forward
putting
away
the
duster
to
be
ready
for
errands
how
are
you
this
morning
asked
douglas
fine
answered
mickey
i
taken
my
family
to
the
country
too
why
mickey
without
saying
a
word
cried
douglas
well
it
happened
so
fast
said
mickey
and
i
did
want
to
bother
you
when
your
head
was
so
full
of
your
old
investigation
and
your
own
moving
did
you
hear
that
leslie
he
asked
mickey
dislikes
my
investigation
as
much
as
the
man
who
comes
out
short
is
going
to
any
day
now
so
you
moved
peaches
to
the
country
you
should
have
told
me
first
i
sorry
if
you
do
like
it
said
mickey
you
see
my
room
was
getting
awful
hot
i
never
was
there
days
this
time
of
year
and
nights
i
slept
on
the
all
right
for
me
but
it
would
do
for
lily
why
should
i
have
told
you
because
miss
winton
had
plans
for
her
explained
douglas
she
intended
to
take
her
to
atwater
and
she
even
contemplated
having
her
back
examined
for
you
mickey
eyes
danced
and
over
his
face
spread
a
slow
grin
of
comprehension
well
ejaculated
douglas
nothing
said
mickey
well
demanded
douglas
mickey
laughed
outright
then
he
sobered
suddenly
and
spoke
gravely
directly
to
miss
winton
thank
you
for
thinking
of
it
and
planning
for
her
he
said
i
was
afraid
you
would
thank
me
for
something
you
feared
i
would
do
mickey
are
you
getting
things
mixed
thank
you
for
thinking
of
lily
and
wanting
to
help
her
explained
mickey
but
she
does
need
you
she
mine
and
i
going
to
keep
her
so
what
i
can
do
for
her
will
have
to
be
enough
until
i
can
do
better
i
see
said
leslie
but
suppose
that
she
should
have
attention
at
once
that
you
ca
give
her
and
i
can
then
i
be
forced
to
let
you
even
if
it
took
her
from
me
agreed
mickey
but
thank
the
lord
things
ai
that
way
i
did
take
my
for
it
i
went
to
the
head
nurse
of
the
star
of
hope
she
gone
to
the
new
elizabeth
home
now
she
loves
to
nurse
children
best
all
the
time
from
the
first
day
she
told
me
how
and
showed
me
so
lily
has
been
taken
care
of
right
you
need
worry
about
that
and
where
she
is
now
if
she
was
a
she
could
have
grander
honest
she
could
but
mickey
how
are
you
going
to
pay
for
all
that
queried
douglas
easy
as
falling
off
a
car
in
a
narrow
skirt
said
mickey
that
big
house
where
things
are
and
a
yard
full
of
trees
and
the
fence
corners
are
cut
with
the
shears
and
the
street
i
mean
the
road
swept
with
a
broom
this
side
the
golf
grounds
about
two
miles
yes
said
douglas
the
woman
there
halted
my
car
one
evening
and
spoke
to
me
about
you
oh
she
did
exclaimed
mickey
well
i
hope
you
gave
me
a
good
she
a
lady
i
most
particular
about
you
see
i
stopped
there
for
a
drink
the
day
you
figured
instead
of
playing
and
she
told
me
about
a
boy
who
was
to
be
sent
out
by
the
and
had
come
and
as
she
was
ready
and
interested
she
was
disappointed
so
i
just
said
to
her
if
the
boy
did
come
how
she
like
to
have
a
nice
good
little
girl
that
would
ever
be
the
least
bother
next
day
she
came
to
see
us
and
away
lily
went
sailing
to
the
country
in
a
big
automobile
and
she
is
coming
back
my
rooms
are
cool
if
she
can
be
spared
then
but
how
are
you
going
to
pay
mickey
most
people
only
take
children
for
a
week
yes
i
know
said
mickey
but
these
folks
have
ever
tried
it
before
and
they
do
know
the
ropes
so
we
doing
it
our
own
way
and
it
works
something
grand
if
they
are
suited
said
douglas
that
place
is
far
better
than
where
we
feel
so
comfortable
we
started
this
morning
said
mickey
the
lady
and
i
traded
jobs
she
sat
on
a
hill
under
an
apple
tree
and
watched
sunrise
i
washed
the
dishes
the
cream
and
scrubbed
the
porch
for
her
when
lily
wakes
up
the
lady
is
going
to
bathe
rub
feed
her
and
see
to
her
like
she
owned
her
to
pay
me
back
it
a
bargain
you
could
beat
it
could
you
of
course
if
you
want
to
turn
yourself
into
a
housemaid
said
douglas
irritably
mickey
laughed
and
leslie
sent
a
slightly
frowning
glance
toward
douglas
you
can
search
me
cried
the
boy
throwing
out
his
hands
in
his
familiar
gesture
why
i
just
love
to
i
always
helped
mother
pay
i
pay
all
right
the
nice
lady
will
say
i
do
and
so
will
peter
it
my
most
important
job
to
make
her
glad
of
me
as
i
am
of
her
and
if
you
put
it
up
to
me
i
a
lot
rather
have
my
job
than
yours
and
i
bet
i
get
more
joy
from
it
for
my
family
croaker
laughed
bruce
going
to
be
a
scream
for
the
fellow
who
comes
short
warned
mickey
so
you
planning
not
to
allow
me
to
do
anything
for
lily
inquired
miss
winton
well

something
you
can
do
this
minute
if
you
like
said
mickey
i
was
going
to
hurry
up
and
see
my
sunshine
nurse
but
it
a
long
way
to
the
new
hospital
and
you
could
do
as
well
if
you
would
mickey
i
love

it

your
family

said
mickey
you
see
i

quite
ready
mickey
what
do
you

about
the
new
elizabeth

douglas
only
that
a
rich
lady
gave
her
house
and
money
and
that
my
sunshine
nurse
is
going
to
be
there
after
this
i
was
going

my
first
trip
i
wondered
said
douglas
mickey
when

that

there
my
eye
cried
mickey
fact
minturn
did
put
his
foot
down
and
took
his
boys
began
douglas
yes

was
telling
me
this
morning
that
what
i
get
for
stopping
at
the
first
page
if
i
inside

known
that
long
ago

queried
douglas
yes

guess

must

of
shied
at
him
he
noticed
it
i
i
did
but
he
caught
me
and
told
me
his
troubles
by
force
we
shook
hands
to
quit
on
say
he
just
fine
when
you
know
him
and
there
does
seem
to
be
a
thing
on
earth
he
would
do
for
you
miss
leslie
why
he
said
if
ever
he
found
happiness
again
and
his
home
become
what
it
should
it
would
be
because
you
were
sorry
for
him
and
fixed
things
mickey
did
he
really
rejoiced
the
girl
douglas
when
may
mickey
show
me
what
he
wants
me
to
do
right

he
answered
i
got
a
load
of
books
while
he
was
away
yesterday
and
i
have
started
them
yet
now
is
the
best
time
when
mickey
made
a
leap
from
the
trolley
platform
that
night
at
what
he
already
had
named
cold
cream
junction
he
was
almost
buried
under
boxes
he
stepped
high
and
prideful
for
he
had
collected
the
money
from
his
paper
route
and
immediately
spent
some
of
it
under
leslie
winton
supervision

on
the
front
porch

comfort

the
tiny

a
detailed
inspection
peaches
leaned
forward
and
reached
toward
him
her
greeting
was
indescribably
sweet
mickey
dropped
the
bundles
and
went
into
her
arms
even
in
his
joy
he
noted
a
new
strength
in
her
grip
on
him
an
unusual
clinging
he
drew
back
half
alarmed

a
good

for
you
ooh
mickey
those
bundles
jus
look
now
you
hold
on
you
wait
and
see
miss
mickey
carried
her
in
then
he
returned
for
the
boxes
he
opened
one
and
from
it
selected
a
pair
of
pink
stockings
and
slipped
them
on
peaches
then
tiny
soft
buckskin
moccasins
embroidered
and
tied
with
ribbons
to
match
the
hose
peaches
squealed
and
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
to
muffle
the
sound
but
harding
heard
and
came
to
the
door
mickey
asked
for
help
young
ladies
who
are
going
automobiling
and
taking
walks
are
well
enough
to
have
dresses
and
things
that
all
girls
have
he
announced
but
i
a
little
dubious
about
how
these
things
go
will
you
dress
her
yes
said
harding
you
fill
the
water
bucket
and
the
wood
box
and
start
the
fire
for
supper
harding
looked
over
the
contents
of
the
box
and
from
plain
soft
pieces
of
underwear
chose
a
gauze
shirt
a
dainty
combination
suit
and
a
tucked
and
trimmed
petticoat
while
peaches
laughed
and
sobbed
for
pure
joy
then
mickey
came
and
harding
went
away
after
various
trials
he
decided
on
a
white
dress
with
pink
ribbons
run
in
the
neck
sleeves
and
belt
slipping
it
on
her
and
carefully
fastening
it
mickey
i
want
the
glass
she
begged
please
oh
please
hurry
mickey
now
you
just
wait
miss
chicken
said
mickey
then
he
brushed
her
hair
and
put
on
a
new
pink
ribbon
not
so
large
as
those
she
had
but
much
more
becoming
he
laid
a
soft
warm
little
gray
sweater
with
white
collar
and
cuffs
in
reach
and
in
turning
it
she
discovered
a
handkerchief
and
a
pair
of
gloves
in
one
pocket
immediately
she
searched
the
other
and
produced
a
purse
with
five
pennies
in
it
then
for
no
reason
at
all
peaches
began
to
cry
well
miss
chicken
exclaimed
mickey
in
surprise
i
thought
you
be
pleased
pleased
sobbed
peaches
pleased
mickey
i
dam
i
busted
oh
well
then
go
on
and
cry
if
you
want
to
agreed
mickey
but
you
look
much
nicer
to
show
harding
and
peter
if
you
would
peaches
immediately
wiped
her
eyes
mickey
lifted
and
carried
her
back
to
the
porch
placing
her
in
a
big
chair
then
he
put
the
gloves
on
her
hands
set
a
hat
on
her
head
and
tied
the
pink
ribbons
peaches
both
laughed
and
cried
at
that
while
the
harding
family
came
in
because
they
could
not
wait
mickey
raised
and
put
in
shaking
fingers
the
crowning
glory
of
any
small
girl
a
wonderful
little
pink
parasol
peaches
appeared
for
a
minute
as
if
a
faint
were
imminent
now
do
you
see
why
i
could
come
with
a
poetry
piece
when
my
head
was
so
full
of
these
things
yes
mickey
but
you
will
before
night
she
begged
you
want
it
even
now
he
marvelled
more
the
passol
even
she
declared
well
you
fool
little
sweet
kid
cried
mickey
and
choked
he
fled
around
the
house
as
peter
came
out
in
his
ears
as
he
went
sounded
peter
big
voice
and
the
delighted
cries
of
the
family
i
want
mickey
wailed
peaches
he
heard
her
call
and
ran
back
fast
for
fear
he
might
be
so
slow
reaching
her
that
peter
would
serve
but
to
his
joy
he
found
that
he
alone
would
answer
i
want
to
see
me
demanded
peaches
sure
you
do
cried
peter
i
just
hand
down
the
big
hall
mirror
so
you
can
see
all
of
you
at
once
he
brought
it
and
set
it
before
her
peaches
stared
and
drew
back
she
cried
ah
in
a
harsh
voice
she
gripped
mickey
with
one
hand
and
the
parasol
with
the
other
she
leaned
and
peeped
and
marvelled
and
smiled
at
a
fully
clothed
little
girl
in
the
glass
while
the
image
smiled
back
peaches
thought
of
letting
go
of
mickey
to
touch
her
hat
and
straighten
her
skirt
but
felt
so
lost
without
him
that
she
handed
peter
the
parasol
and
used
that
hand
while
the
other
clung
to
her
refuge
when
mickey
saw
the
treasure
go
in
his
favour
he
swallowed
lumps
of
emotion
so
big
that
the
hardings
could
see
them
running
down
his
throat
peaches
intent
on
the
glass
smiled
grimaced
tilted
her
head
and
finally
began
flirting
outrageously
with
herself
until
all
of
them
laughed
and
recalled
her
she
looked
at
peter
smiled
her
most
winsome
smile
and
exclaimed
well
ai
i
the
now
you
go
easy
miss
chicken
warned
mickey
mickey
if
you
had
stopped
me
i
done
it
sure
sobbed
peaches
collapsing
against
him
i
had
would
you
these
things
from
me
no
i
would
said
mickey
i
could
to
save
me
but
i
mickey
i
so
tired
she
said
take
my
hat
an
put
it
where
i
can
see
it
an
my
passol
an
my
coat
gee
i
do
have
to
be
wrapped
in
sheets
no
more
an
lay
me
down
quick
mickey
i
well
i
ought
to
had
the
sense
not
to
spring
so
much
all
at
once
said
mickey
but
it
all
seemed
to
belong
sure
i
will
you
poor
kid
and
mickey
you
wo
forget
the
lesson
and
the
piece
she
panted
no
i
wo
forget
promised
mickey
as
he
stretched
her
among
her
treasures
and
watched
her
fall
asleep
even
while
he
slipped
the
gloves
from
her
fingers
next
morning
she
found
the
lesson
and
the
poetry
on
her
slate
harding
bathed
and
clothed
her
in
the
little
garments
and
showed
her
enough
more
for
the
changes
she
would
need
even
two
finer
dresses
for
sunday
she
left
the
coat
hat
and
parasol
in
reach
then
peaches
resolutely
took
up
her
pencil
and
set
herself
to
copy
the
lines
without
knowing
enough
of
the
words
to
really
understand
but
she
was
extremely
well
acquainted
with
one
word
that
mickey
had
said
just
flew
out
of
his
mouth
when
he
looked
at
her
and
in
her
supreme
satisfaction
over
her
new
possessions
she
was
sure
the
lines
must
be
concerning
them
most
of
all
she
was
delighted
with
her
slippers
a
hundred
times
that
morning
she
looked
down
wiggled
her
toes
and
moved
her
feet
so
that
she
could
see
them
better
between
whiles
she
copied
over
and
over
miss
daily
went
walking
in
slippers
so
nifty
the
neighbours
were
talking
the
minute
she
raised
her
gay
pink
parasol
the
old
red
cow
began
to
friskily
bawl
when
they
observed
the
neat
coat
on
her
back
all
the
guineas
in
the
orchard
cried
rack
pot
rack
she
was
so
lovely
a
bird
flying
her
way
sang
sweet
sweet
sweet
all
the
rest
of
the
peter
came
in
to
visit
a
few
minutes
so
she
gave
him
the
slate
to
see
if
he
could
read
her
copy
and
by
this
ruse
she
found
what
the
lines
were
she
was
so
overjoyed
she
opened
her
lips
and
then
clapped
both
hands
over
them
to
smother
the
ejaculation
at
her
tongue
end
to
distract
peter
she
stuck
out
her
foot
and
moved
it
for
him
to
see
ai
that
pretty
an
jus
as
soft
and
fine
she
asked
yes
said
peter
they
remind
me
of
a
flower
called
slipper
that
grows
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
it
that
shape
and
the
prettiest
gold
yellow
but
little
they
about
fit
your
doll
oh
peter
could
you
get
me
one
i
want
to
see
why
i
would
but
they
are
all
gone
now
honey
answered
peter
next
year
i
remember
and
bring
you
some
when
they
bloom
but
it
likely
by
that
time
you
can
go
yourself
and
see
them
do
you
honest
think
it
peter
asked
peaches
leaning
forward
eagerly
yes
i
honest
think
it
repeated
peter
emphatically
but
i
wo
be
here
then
peaches
reminded
him
well
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
you
not
said
peter
chapter
xvii
in
an
ancient
and
honourable
now
father
you
said
if
i
help
till
after
harvest
i
could
go
to
multiopolis
and
hunt
a
job
junior
reminded
peter
when
may
i
i
remember
said
peter
you
may
start
monday
morning
if
you
want
to
ma
and
i
have
talked
it
over
and
if
you
bound
to
leave
us
i
guess
there
never
be
a
better
time
i
can
get
jud
jason
to
drive
the
cream
wagon
for
me
and
i
do
the
best
i
can
at
the
barn
i
had
hoped
that
we
be
partners
and
work
together
all
our
days
but
if
you
have
decided
upon
leaving
us
of
course
you
wo
be
satisfied
till
done
it
well
i
can
try
said
junior
and
if
i
do
like
it
i
can
come
back
i
do
know
about
that
objected
peter
of
course
i
have
other
help
hired
your
room
would
be
occupied
and
your
work
contracted
for
well
i
had
figured
on
that
he
said
i
supposed
i
could
go
and
try
it
and
if
i
did
like
it
i
could
come
home
could
i
come
home
ma
nancy
slowly
became
a
greenish
white
colour
but
the
situation
had
been
discussed
so
often
it
worried
her
dreadfully
now
that
it
had
to
be
met
evasion
would
do
no
good
peter
grimly
watched
her
he
knew
she
was
struggling
with
a
woman
inborn
impulse
to
be
the
haven
of
her
children
her
son
her
especially
he
was
surprised
to
hear
her
saying
why
i
hardly
think
so
junior
it
would
be
a
right
start
in
life
you
must
figure
that
whatever
kind
of
work
you
find
or
whoever
you
work
for
there
will
be
things
you
wo
like
or
think
fair
but
if
you
are
going
to
be
your
own
man
you
must
begin
like
a
man
and
of
course
a
man
does
go
into
business
with
his
mind
made
up
to
run
for
his
mother
petticoats
the
first
thing
that
displeases
him
no
i
guess
if
you
go
you
must
start
with
your
mind
made
up
to
stay
till
the
october
term
of
school
opens
anyway
then
we
call
that
settled
said
peter
you
may
go
with
mickey
on
the
monday
morning
car
and
we
probably
wo
see
you
again
till
you
are
one
of
the
leading
business
men
of
multiopolis
and
drive
out
in
your
automobile
have
you
decided
which
make
you
get
well
from
what
i
learned
driving
yours
if
i
were
buying
one
myself
i
get
a
said
junior
they
strike
me
as
the
best
car
on
the
market
peter
glanced
sharply
at
his
son
when
he
saw
that
the
answer
was
perfectly
sincere
his
heart
almost
played
him
the
trick
he
had
expected
from
his
wife
all
right
ma
gather
up
his
clothes
and
get
them
washed
and
have
him
ready
said
peter
i
thought
maybe
you
take
me
in
the
car
and
sort
of
look
around
with
me
said
junior
i
do
see
how
i
am
going
to
do
it
with
both
our
work
piled
on
me
said
peter
and
besides
i
a
farmer
born
and
bred
i
would
have
the
first
idea
about
how
to
get
a
boy
a
job
in
the
city
or
what
he
ought
to
do
or
have
mickey
is
on
to
all
that
he
go
with
you
you
mickey
sure
said
mickey
and
you
can
save
a
lot
by
using
my
room
it
is
high
but
it
clean
junior
scowled
but
mickey
proceeded
calmly
and
while
it
gets
hot
in
the
daytime
if
you
open
the
door
at
night
and
push
the
bed
before
the
window
it
soon
cools
off
while
very
hottest
times
i
always
take
to
the
it
nice
and
cool
there
of
course
that
will
be
the
ticket
said
peter
heartily
a
boy
starting
with
everything
to
learn
could
expect
to
earn
much
and
when
you
have
ma
and
me
to
depend
on
for
your
board
you
be
glad
to
have
the
bed
free
thank
you
mickey
that
fine
junior
did
not
look
as
if
he
thought
it
were
presently
he
asked
how
much
money
ought
i
to
take
to
start
on
mickey
hully
gee
said
mickey
why
your
fare
in
you
going
to
make
money
kid
not
to
spend
it
if
i
was
turned
loose
there
with
just
one
cent
i
be
flying
by
night
and
if
i
had
the
cent
i
soon
earn
it
how
could
you
mickey
asked
junior
eagerly
with
or
without
queried
mickey
both
exclaimed
junior
well
said
mickey
i
keep
my
lamps
trimmed
and
burning
and
i
catch
a
lady
falling
off
a
car
or
pick
up
a
purse
or
a
kid
or
run
an
errand
there
be
only
one
thing
i
think
of
because
papers
are
my
game
i
buy
one
for
a
penny
and
sell
it
for
two
buy
two
sell
for
four
you
know
the
multiplication
table
you
but
of
course
you
do
want
a
street
job
you
want
in
a
factory
or
a
store
if
you
could
do
what
you
like
best
what
would
it
be
junior
junior
opened
his
mouth
several
times
and
at
last
admitted
he
thought
that
far
why
i
do
know
well
said
mickey
calmly
there
making
things
that
factories
there
selling
them
that
stores
there
doctors
and
lawyers
that
professional
like
my
boss
and
there
like
the
men
he
is
after
but
of
course
you
have
to
be
old
enough
to
vote
and
educated
enough
to
do
business
and
have
enough
money
earned
at
something
else
to
buy
your
office
that
too
far
away
now
if
you
do
like
the
street
there
the
other
three
the
quickest
money
would
be
in
the
first
two
if
you
were
making
things
what
would
you
make
automobiles
said
junior
all
right
said
mickey
we
can
try
them
first
if
we
ca
find
a
factory
that
you
like
what
would
you
rather
sell
automobiles
said
junior
promptly
gee
said
mickey
i
see
where
we
hit
that
business
at
both
ends
if
we
miss
what
next
i
do
know
said
junior
i
make
up
my
mind
when
i
have
looked
around
some
you
can
come
closer
deciding
out
here
than
you
can
in
the
rush
of
the
streets
said
mickey
there
you
be
rustling
for
your
supper
and
you
find
boys
hunting
jobs
thick
as
men
at
a
ball
game
and
lots
of
them
with
dads
to
furnish
their
room
and
board
junior
hesitated
but
mickey
excused
himself
and
without
having
been
told
what
to
do
he
accomplished
half
a
day
work
for
harding
then
began
some
of
peter
jobs
and
afterward
turned
his
attention
to
hearing
peaches
lesson
and
setting
her
new
copy
when
junior
paid
his
fare
monday
morning
mickey
judging
by
the
change
he
exhibited
realized
that
both
his
mother
and
father
had
given
him
to
start
on
a
dollar
to
spend
mickey
would
have
preferred
that
he
be
penniless
he
decided
as
they
ran
cityward
that
the
first
thing
was
to
part
junior
from
his
money
so
he
told
him
he
would
be
compelled
to
work
in
the
forenoon
and
for
a
while
in
the
afternoon
and
left
him
to
his
own
devices
on
the
street
with
a
agreed
on
at
noon
when
mickey
reached
the
spot
he
found
junior
with
a
pocket
full
of
candy
eating
early
peaches
and
instead
of
hunting
work
he
had
attended
three
picture
shows
mickey
could
have
figured
to
within
ten
cents
of
what
was
left
of
one
of
junior
dollars
but
as
the
cure
did
not
really
begin
until
the
money
disappeared
the
quicker
it
went
the
better
as
he
ate
his
sandwich
and
drank
his
milk
he
watched
junior
making
a
dinner
of
meat
potatoes
pie
and
and
made
a
mental
estimate
of
the
remains
of
the
other
dollar
as
a
basis
for
a
later
i
told
you
so
he
remonstrated
and
pointed
out
the
fact
that
there
were
hundreds
of
unemployed
men
of
strength
skilled
artisans
with
families
to
support
looking
for
work
that
minute
i
know
your
dad
signed
up
that
contract
with
jud
jason
he
said
i
saw
him
and
that
means
that
he
got
no
use
for
you
for
three
months
so
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
for
that
long
at
least
if
you
got
any
ginger
in
you
of
course
explained
mickey
i
know
that
most
city
men
think
country
boys
wo
stick
and
are
big
cowards
but
i
expecting
you
to
show
them
just
where
they
are
mistaken
i
know
you
not
lazy
and
i
know
you
got
as
much
sand
and
grit
as
any
city
boy
but
you
must
to
the
rest
of
them
you
must
show
up
sure
said
junior
i
convince
them
by
night
the
last
penny
of
the
second
dollar
was
gone
so
junior
borrowed
his
fare
to
his
room
from
mickey
who
was
to
remain
with
him
to
show
him
the
way
back
and
forth
and
to
spend
an
early
hour
in
search
of
employment
it
was
mickey
first
night
away
from
peaches
and
while
he
knew
she
was
safe
he
felt
that
when
night
came
she
would
miss
him
the
thought
that
she
might
cry
for
him
tormented
him
to
speech
he
pointed
out
to
junior
very
clearly
that
he
would
have
to
mark
corners
and
keep
his
eyes
open
because
he
need
not
expect
that
he
could
leave
her
longer
than
that
junior
agreed
with
him
for
he
had
promised
peaches
in
saying
to
keep
mickey
only
one
night
he
had
treated
himself
to
candy
and
unusual
fruits
until
his
money
was
gone
while
by
night
these
and
a
walk
of
miles
on
hot
pavement
had
bred
such
an
appetite
that
he
felt
he
had
not
eaten
a
full
meal
in
years
so
when
mickey
brought
out
the
remains
of
the
food
harding
had
given
him
her
son
felt
insulted
but
mickey
figured
a
day
on
the
basis
of
what
he
had
earned
what
he
had
expended
what
he
must
save
to
be
ready
when
the
great
surgeon
came
and
prepared
exactly
as
he
would
have
done
for
himself
and
peaches
on
reaching
the
tenement
and
climbing
until
his
legs
ached
junior
faced
stifling
heat
but
mickey
opened
the
window
and
started
a
draft
by
setting
the
door
wide
while
they
ate
supper
mickey
talked
unceasingly
but
junior
was
sulkily
silent
he
tried
the
but
one
glance
from
the
rickety
affair
hung
a
mile
above
the
ground
it
seemed
to
him
was
enough
so
he
climbed
back
in
the
window
and
tossed
on
the
bed
junior
did
his
first
real
thinking
that
night
he
was
ravenous
before
morning
and
aghast
at
what
he
was
offered
for
breakfast
he
was
eager
to
find
work
and
he
knew
for
what
his
first
day
wage
would
go
in
justice
to
his
own
sense
of
honour
and
in
justice
to
junior
mere
common
fairness
such
as
he
would
have
wanted
in
like
case
for
the
first
few
days
mickey
honestly
and
unceasingly
hunted
employment
with
junior
at
his
elbow
he
suffered
one
rebuff
after
another
until
it
was
clear
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
country
boy
unused
to
the
ways
of
the
city
to
find
or
to
hold
a
job
at
which
he
could
survive
even
with
his
room
provided
while
the
city
swarmed
with
unemployed
men
everywhere
they
found
the
work
they
would
have
liked
done
by
an
italian
greek
swede
german
or
polander
who
seemed
strong
as
oxen
oblivious
as
no
doubt
they
were
to
treatment
junior
never
had
seen
accorded
a
balky
mule
and
able
to
live
on
a
chunk
of
black
bread
a
bit
of
cheese
and
a
few
cents
worth
of
stale
beer
when
mickey
had
truly
convinced
himself
of
what
he
had
believed
with
a
free
conscience
he
then
began
allowing
junior
to
find
out
for
himself
exactly
what
he
was
facing
by
that
time
junior
had
lost
himself
on
the
way
to
rooms
spent
a
night
wandering
the
streets
and
breakfastless
was
waiting
before
the
iriquois
mickey
listened
sympathetically
supplied
a
dime
which
seemed
to
be
all
he
had
for
breakfast
and
said
as
he
entered
the
building
well
kid
we
can
find
a
job
you
just
have
to
go
up
against
the
street
if
i
can
live
and
save
money
at
it
you
ought
to
be
smart
enough
to
go
to
it
i
get
my
day
work
done
you
just
ca
go
home
because
they
think
you
do
amount
to
anything
the
fellows
will
make
game
of
you
and
besides
jud
is
doing
wonderfully
well
your
father
said
so
he
seemed
so
tickled
over
him
i
guess
the
fact
is
he
is
getting
more
help
from
him
that
he
ever
did
from
junior
boy
so
your
job
there
is
open
go
at
whatever
you
can
see
that
needs
to
be
done
i
get
my
work
over
and
we
try
again
i
be
out
about
three
and
you
can
meet
me
here
empty
and
disheartened
junior
squeezed
the
dime
and
hurried
toward
the
nearest
restaurant
but
the
transaction
had
been
witnessed
by
a
boy
as
hungry
as
he
and
hardened
to
the
street
how
junior
came
to
be
sprawling
on
the
sidewalk
he
never
knew
only
that
his
hand
involuntarily
opened
in
falling
and
he
threw
it
out
to
catch
himself
so
he
could
find
the
dime
before
noon
he
was
sick
and
reeling
with
sleeplessness
and
hunger
he
was
waiting
when
it
was
mickey
time
to
lunch
but
he
did
not
come
and
in
desperation
junior
really
tried
the
street
at
last
he
achieved
a
nickel
by
snatching
a
dropped
bundle
from
under
a
car
he
sat
a
long
time
in
a
stairway
looking
at
it
and
then
having
reached
a
stage
where
he
was
more
sick
and
less
hungry
he
hunted
a
telephone
booth
and
tried
to
get
his
home
only
to
learn
that
the
family
was
away
gladdened
by
the
thought
that
they
might
be
in
the
city
he
walked
miles
watching
the
curb
before
stores
where
they
shopped
searching
for
their
car
and
he
told
himself
that
if
he
found
it
nothing
could
separate
him
from
the
steering
gear
until
he
sped
past
all
regulation
straight
to
his
mother
cupboard
he
had
wanted
ham
and
chicken
in
the
beginning
later
helping
himself
to
cold
food
in
the
cellar
seemed
a
luxury
then
crackers
and
cookies
in
the
cupboard
would
have
satisfied
his
wildest
desire
and
before
three
junior
in
mad
rebellion
remembered
his
mother
slop
bucket
how
did
she
dare
put
big
pieces
of
bread
and
things
good
enough
for
any
one
to
eat
in
feed
for
pigs
and
poultry
if
he
ever
reached
home
he
resolved
he
would
put
a
stop
to
that
at
three
to
mickey
cheerful
now
we
find
a
job
or
make
it
he
answered
no
we
will
find
a
square
meal
or
steal
it
and
then
he
told
mickey
watched
him
reflectively
but
as
he
figured
the
case
it
was
not
for
him
to
suggest
retreat
he
condoled
paid
for
the
meal
and
started
hunting
work
again
with
junior
silent
and
dogged
beside
him
to
the
surprise
of
both
almost
at
once
they
found
a
place
for
a
week
with
a
florist
junior
went
to
work
after
a
few
tasks
bunglingly
performed
he
was
tried
on
messenger
service
and
started
with
his
carfare
to
deliver
a
box
containing
a
funeral
piece
he
had
no
idea
where
he
was
to
go
or
what
car
line
to
take
in
his
extremity
a
bootblack
came
to
his
aid
he
safely
delivered
the
box
at
a
residence
where
the
owner
was
leaving
his
door
for
his
car
he
gave
junior
half
a
dollar
junior
met
the
first
friendly
greeting
he
had
encountered
in
multiopolis
as
he
reached
the
street
two
boys
larger
than
he
walked
beside
him
and
talked
so
frankly
that
before
he
reached
his
car
line
he
felt
he
had
made
friends
they
offered
to
show
him
a
shorter
cut
to
the
car
line
just
by
going
up
an
alley
and
out
on
a
side
street
at
the
proper
place
for
seclusion
the
one
behind
knocked
him
senseless
and
the
one
before
wheeled
and
relieved
him
of
money
and
both
fled
junior
lay
for
a
time
then
slowly
came
back
but
he
was
weak
and
ill
he
knew
without
investigating
what
had
happened
and
preferring
the
mercy
that
might
be
inside
to
that
of
the
alley
he
crawled
into
a
back
door
it
proved
to
be
a
morgue
a
workman
came
to
his
assistance
felt
the
lump
on
his
head
noticed
the
sickness
on
his
face
and
gave
him
a
place
to
rest
junior
was
dubious
from
the
start
about
feeling
better
as
he
watched
the
surroundings
the
proprietor
came
past
and
inquired
who
he
was
and
why
he
was
there
junior
told
him
and
showed
the
lumps
behind
his
ear
and
on
his
forehead
to
prove
his
words
the
man
was
human
he
gave
junior
another
nickel
and
told
him
which
car
to
take
from
his
front
door
he
had
to
stand
aside
and
see
five
pieces
of
charred
humanity
from
a
explosion
carried
through
the
door
before
he
had
a
chance
to
leave
it
he
reached
the
florist
two
hours
late
and
in
spite
of
his
story
and
his
perfectly
discernible
bumps
to
prove
it
he
was
discharged
as
a
fool
for
following
strangers
into
an
alley
on
the
streets
once
more
and
penniless
he
started
to
walk
the
miles
to
his
room
when
he
found
the
building
he
thought
it
would
be
cooler
to
climb
the
and
sit
on
it
until
he
decided
what
to
do
then
he
could
open
the
door
from
the
inside
at
the
top
he
thrust
a
foot
head
and
shoulders
into
the
room
and
realized
he
had
selected
the
wrong
escape
he
tried
to
draw
back
but
two
men
leaped
for
him
and
as
he
was
doubled
in
the
window
he
could
not
make
a
swift
movement
he
was
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
cursed
for
a
prowling
thief
his
protestations
silenced
his
pockets
searched
and
when
they
yielded
nothing
his
body
stripped
of
its
clean
wholesome
clothing
and
he
was
pitched
down
the
stairs
he
appealed
to
several
people
and
found
that
the
less
he
said
the
safer
he
was
he
snatched
a
towel
from
a
basket
of
clothes
before
a
door
twisted
it
around
him
and
ran
down
the
street
to
mickey
front
entrance
with
all
his
remaining
breath
he
sped
up
flight
after
flight
of
stairs
and
at
last
reached
the
locked
door
only
to
find
that
the
key
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
stolen
trousers
and
he
could
not
force
his
way
with
his
bare
hands
he
could
only
get
to
his
clothing
by
trying
the
again
he
was
almost
too
sick
to
see
or
cling
to
the
narrow
iron
steps
but
that
time
he
counted
carefully
and
looked
until
he
was
sure
before
he
entered
he
found
his
clothes
and
in
the
intense
heat
dressed
himself
but
he
could
not
open
the
door
he
sat
on
the
to
think
presently
he
espied
one
of
the
men
who
had
robbed
him
watching
him
from
another
escape
and
being
afraid
and
beaten
sore
he
crept
into
the
heat
and
lay
on
the
bed
beside
the
window
after
a
while
a
breath
of
air
came
in
and
junior
slept
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
when
he
awoke
it
was
morning
his
head
aching
his
mouth
dry
and
the
room
cooler
glancing
toward
the
door
he
saw
it
standing
open
and
then
noticed
the
disorder
of
the
room
and
of
himself
and
sat
up
to
find
he
was
on
the
floor
once
more
disrobed
and
the
place
stripped
of
every
portable
thing
in
it
even
the
bed
little
stove
and
the
trunk
filled
with
clothes
and
a
few
personal
possessions
sacred
to
mickey
because
they
had
been
his
mother
the
men
had
used
the
key
in
junior
pocket
to
enter
while
he
slept
drugged
him
and
carried
away
everything
he
crept
to
the
door
and
closed
it
then
sank
on
the
floor
and
cried
until
he
again
became
unconscious
it
was
four
that
afternoon
when
mickey
looked
in
and
understood
the
situation
he
bent
over
bruised
and
battered
body
stared
at
his
swollen
face
and
darting
from
the
room
brought
water
and
then
food
and
clothing
redressed
and
fed
junior
lay
on
the
floor
and
said
to
mickey
go
to
the
nearest
and
call
father
tell
him
i
sick
to
come
in
a
hurry
with
the
car
sure
said
mickey
but
had
we
better
wait
morning
now
and
get
you
rested
and
fed
up
a
little
no
said
junior
the
sooner
he
sees
the
fix
i
in
the
better
he
will
realize
that
i
not
a
quitter
but
that
this
ai
just
the
place
for
me
mickey
did
you
ever
go
through
this
why
do
i
get
it
so
awful
hard
it
because
the
regulars
can
tell
a
mile
off
you
are
country
junior
said
mickey
all
my
life
i
been
on
the
streets
so
they
knew
me
for
city
born
and
supposed
i
friends
to
trace
them
and
back
me
if
they
abused
me
and
then
i
always
look
ahead
sharp
and
trust
a
living
soul
about
alleys
you
say
the
next
escape
but
one
got
to
find
them
and
get
back
my
things
i
want
mother
and
lily
and
i
ca
live
this
winter
with
no
bed
and
no
stove
and
nothing
at
all
i
sorry
about
your
mother
things
mickey
but
do
worry
over
the
rest
said
junior
pa
and
ma
wo
ever
be
willing
to
give
up
peaches
again
i
can
see
that
right
now
and
if
they
keep
her
they
will
have
to
take
you
too
because
of
course
you
ca
be
separated
from
her
your
goods
i
pay
back
i
owe
you
a
lot
as
it
is
but
i
got
some
money
in
the
bank
and
i
have
to
sell
my
sheep
junior
laid
his
head
on
his
arm
and
sobbed
weakly
do
junior
said
mickey
i
feel
just
awful
about
this
i
thought
you
had
a
place
that
would
earn
your
supper
and
you
had
the
room
and
would
be
all
right
why
of
course
said
junior
mickey
looked
intently
at
him
now
look
here
junior
he
said
i
got
to
square
myself
on
this
i
did
think
all
the
time
you
like
multiopolis
when
you
saw
it
with
the
bark
off
course
viewing
it
on
a
full
stomach
from
an
automobile
with
spending
money
in
your
pocket
and
a
smooth
run
to
a
good
home
before
you
is
one
thing
facing
up
to
it
and
asking
it
to
hand
out
those
things
to
you
in
return
for
work
you
can
do
here
without
knowing
the
ropes
is
another
you
stuck
it
out
longer
than
i
would
honest
you
have
but
it
is
your
game
and
you
do
know
how
and
you
be
a
fool
to
learn
i
thought
you
get
enough
to
satisfy
you
when
you
came
but
seeing
for
yourself
seemed
to
be
the
only
way
to
cure
you
oh
do
start
the
told
you
so
said
junior
father
and
mother
will
hand
it
out
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
as
lief
die
as
go
back
but
i
going
not
because
i
ca
get
in
the
game
and
make
a
living
if
you
can
even
if
i
have
to
go
out
and
start
as
you
did
with
a
penny
i
going
back
but
not
for
the
reason
you
think
it
because
seen
at
close
range
multiopolis
ai
what
it
looks
like
from
an
automobile
i
know
something
that
i
really
know
and
that
comes
natural
to
me
that
beats
it
a
mile
and
now
i
had
my
chance
and
made
my
choice
i
so
sore
i
ca
walk
but
if
you
just
call
father
and
tell
him
to
come
in
on
high
i
settle
with
you
later
course
if
that
the
way
you
feel
i
call
him
said
mickey
but
junior
let
me
finish
this
much
i
was
trying
to
say
i
knew
multiopolis
would
do
to
you
all
it
had
done
to
me
and
i
knew
you
would
like
it
but
i
figure
on
your
big
frame
and
fresh
face
spelling
country
it
would
show
a
mile
down
the
street
i
figure
on
you
getting
the
show
i
would
and
i
intend
anything
worse
should
happen
to
you
than
has
to
me
honest
i
did
i
just
about
sick
over
this
junior
do
you
want
to

time

well
come
at
once
then
let
go
out
on
the
car
said
mickey
i
guess
you
do
realize
just
how
bad
this
is
said
junior
you
call
father
and
call
him
quick
and
emphatic
enough
to
bring
him
all
right
then
said
mickey
here
goes
and
put
the
call
in
nearest
place
you
can
find
and
hustle
back
said
junior
i
done
with
alleys
and
sluggers
and
robbers
goliath
could
have
held
his
own
against
two
big
men
when
he
was
fifteen
and
i
guess
father
wo
think
i
a
coward
because
they
got
away
with
me
but
you
hurry
sure
i
fly
and
i
get
him
if
i
can
there
no
doubt
about
getting
him
this
is
baked
potato
bacon
blackberry
roll
honey
and
bread
time
at
our
house
they
would
be
away
just
now
and
it
strange
they
have
been
so
much
this
week
mickey
gave
junior
a
swift
glance
then
raced
to
the
nearest
telephone
you
mickey
queried
peter
yes
it
you
for
and
i
to
tell
you
to
come
on
high
and
lose
no
time
in
starting
am
i
to
come
mickey
or
am
i
too
busy
you
are
to
come
peter
to
my
room
and
in
a
hurry
things
did
work
according
to
program
why
what
the
matter
mickey
just
what
i
told
you
would
be
when
it
came
to
getting
a
job
here
but
i
did
figure
on
street
sharks
picking
on
junior
and
robbing
him
and
following
him
to
my
room
and
slugging
him
he
ca
walk
you
come
peter
and
come
in
a
hurry
and
peter
you
better
let
me
start
said
peter
yes
but
peter
one
minute
insisted
mickey
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
this
did
work
out
as
i
planned
and
i
awful
sorry
and
you
be
too
but
junior
is
cured
done
enough
to
suit
you
he
ever
want
to
leave
you
again
you
can
bank
on
that
and
he
ai
hurt
permanent
but
if
you
have
got
anything
in
your
system
that
sounds
even
a
little
bit
like
told
you
so
forget
it
on
the
way
in
and
leave
instructions
with
the
family
to
do
the
same
see
junior
is
awful
sore
he
do
need
anything
rubbed
in
in
the
way
of
reminiscences
ready
to
do
the
talking
see
yes
you
sure
he
ai
really
hurt
sure
said
mickey
three
days
will
fix
him
but
peter
it
been
mighty
rough
go
easy
will
you
mickey
have
you
got
money
all
we
need
just
you
get
here
with
the
car
and
put
in
a
comfort
and
pillow
all
my
stuff
is
gone
peter
senior
arrived
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
knelt
on
the
floor
and
looked
closely
at
his
sleeping
boy
naked
and
beaten
to
insensibility
you
say
mickey
nodded
nothing
to
eat
for
nearly
two
days
another
affirmation
peter
arose
pushed
back
his
hat
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
i
have
been
thinking
about
anything
but
him
ever
since
he
left
he
said
and
what
makes
me
the
sorest
is
that
the
longer
i
think
of
it
the
surer
i
get
that
this
is
my
fault
i
did
raise
him
right
peter
protested
mickey
i
got
it
all
studied
out
said
peter
and
i
did
there
have
been
two
mistakes
junior
and
mine
and
of
the
two
mine
is
twice
as
big
as
the
boy
peter
stooped
and
picked
up
his
son
who
stirred
and
awakened
when
he
found
himself
in
his
father
arms
junior
clung
to
him
and
whispered
over
and
over
father
dear
father
peter
gripped
him
with
all
his
might
and
whispered
back
forgive
me
son
forgive
me
well
i
do
know
what
for
sobbed
junior
you
will
before
long
said
peter
he
drove
to
a
cool
place
and
let
the
car
stand
while
he
called
his
wife
and
explained
all
of
the
situation
he
saw
fit
she
was
waiting
at
the
gate
when
they
came
she
never
said
a
word
except
to
urge
junior
to
eat
his
supper
but
junior
had
no
appetite
i
want
to
run
things
here
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
when
the
children
finish
put
them
to
bed
and
then
let
me
tell
you
and
you
can
decide
what
you
do
to
me
well
do
you
worry
about
that
said
peter
no
i
wo
said
junior
because
there
nothing
you
can
do
that
will
be
half
i
deserve
when
the
little
folks
were
asleep
and
mickey
had
helped
harding
finish
the
work
and
jud
jason
had
been
paid
five
dollars
for
his
contract
and
had
gone
home
junior
lay
in
the
hammock
on
the
front
porch
while
his
father
mother
and
mickey
sat
close
when
he
started
to
speak
peter
said
now
junior
wait
a
minute
you
been
gone
a
week
and
during
that
time
i
used
my
brains
more
than
i
ever
did
in
a
like
period
even
when
i
was
courting
your
ma
and
the
subject
i
laboured
on
was
what
took
you
away
from
us
i
found
out
why
you
were
not
satisfied
and
who
made
you
dissatisfied
the
guilty
party
is
peter
harding
aided
and
abetted
by
one
nancy
harding
otherwise
known
as
ma
why
father
interrupted
junior
silence
said
peter
i
just
found
out
that
it
a
man
job
to
be
the
of
his
and
i
going
to
be
the
head
of
mine
after
this
and
like
mickey
here
going
to
keep
it
let
me
finish
spent
this
week
thinking
and
all
the
things
i
have
thought
would
make
a
bigger
book
than
the
dictionary
if
they
were
set
down
why
should
you
ask
to
be
forgiven
for
a
desire
to
go
to
multiopolis
when
i
carried
you
there
as
a
baby
led
you
as
a
toddler
and
went
with
you
every
chance
i
could
trump
up
as
a
man
who
bought
and
fed
you
painted
adulterated
candy
as
a
child
when
your
ma
should
have
made
you
pure
clean
taffy
at
home
from
our
maple
syrup
or
as
good
sugar
as
we
could
buy
often
spent
money
that
now
should
be
on
interest
for
fruit
that
looked
fine
to
you
there
and
proved
to
be
grainy
too
mellow
sour
or
not
half
so
good
as
what
you
had
at
home
i
never
took
you
hunting
or
fishing
or
camping
or
swimming
in
your
life
but
i
have
had
a
mite
of
trouble
to
find
time
and
money
to
take
you
to
circuses
which
i
do
regret
i
do
again
and
picture
shows
which
i
do
also
and
other
shows
i
not
condemning
any
form
of
amusement
we
ever
patronized
so
much
we
probably
do
all
of
it
again
but
what
gets
me
now
is
how
i
ever
came
to
think
that
the
only
and
those
worth
taking
time
and
spending
money
on
were
running
to
multiopolis
to
eat
to
laugh
to
look
and
getting
little
to
show
for
it
but
disappointment
and
suffering
for
all
of
us
you
have
had
the
only
punishment
that
struck
the
harding
family
this
week
junior
your
ma
and
i
have
had
our
share
and
i
asked
her
if
she
has
got
enough
but
speaking
strictly
for
myself
i
have
i
would
live
through
it
again
for
the
farm
sobbed
harding
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at
pa
and
it
we
who
are
the
guilty
parties
just
as
you
say
junior
sat
up
and
stared
at
them
i
do
so
much
regret
the
things
i
did
said
peter
as
i
condemn
myself
for
the
things
i
have
done
i
have
taught
you
to
ride
so
you
do
look
a
spectacle
on
a
horse
and
yet
horses
should
come
as
natural
as
breathing
to
you
you
should
be
a
skilled
marksman
you
could
hit
a
at
ten
paces
you
should
swim
like
a
fish
with
a
hundred
lakes
in
your
country
you
drown
if
you
were
thrown
in
the
middle
of
one
and
left
to
yourself
you
ought
to
be
able
to
row
a
boat
as
well
as
it
can
be
done
and
cast
a
line
with
all
the
skill
any
lad
of
your
age
possesses
that
you
ca
make
even
a
fair
showing
at
any
sport
results
from
the
fact
that
every
time
your
father
had
a
minute
to
spare
he
took
you
and
headed
straight
for
multiopolis
here
the
golf
links
at
our
door
and
if
ever
any
game
was
a
farmer
game
and
if
any
man
has
a
right
to
hold
up
his
head
and
tramp
his
own
hills
and
swing
a
strong
arm
and
a
free
one
and
make
a
masterly
stroke
a
there
no
reason
why
plowing
and
tilling
should
dull
the
brains
bend
the
back
or
make
a
of
a
man
modern
methods
show
you
how
to
do
the
same
thing
a
better
way
how
to
work
one
machine
instead
of
ten
men
how
to
have
time
for
a
vacation
just
as
city
men
do
and
how
to
have
money
for
books
and
music
and
school
instead
of
loading
with
so
much
land
it
a
burden
to
pay
the
taxes
i
have
quite
a
bunch
of
land
for
sale
and
i
see
a
way
open
to
make
three
times
the
money
i
ever
did
with
half
the
hard
work
we
turned
over
a
new
leaf
at
this
place
from
start
to
finish
including
the
house
barn
land
and
family
a
year
from
now
you
wo
know
any
of
us
but
that
later
just
now
it
this
i
pointing
out
to
you
junior
exactly
how
you
came
to
have
your
hankering
for
multiopolis
i
can
see
you
followed
the
way
we
set
you
thinking
that
all
the
amusing
things
were
there
the
smart
people
the
fine
clothes
the
wealth
and
the
freedom
yes
you
ought
to
see
the
things
and
the
people
when
your
stomach
cramping
and
your
head
splitting
cried
junior
i
tell
you
down
among
them
it
looks
different
from
riding
past
in
an
automobile
exactly
conceded
peter
exactly
what
i
coming
at
all
your
life
i
given
you
the
wrong
viewpoint
now
you
can
busy
yourselves
planning
how
to
make
our
share
of
the
world
over
so
it
will
bring
all
the
joy
of
life
right
to
the
front
door
i
guess
the
first
big
thing
is
to
currycomb
the
whole
place
and
fix
it
as
it
should
be
to
be
most
convenient
for
us
then
we
better
take
a
course
of
training
in
making
up
our
minds
to
be
with
what
we
can
afford
junior
does
home
look
better
to
you
than
it
did
this
time
last
week
father
began
junior
and
sobbed
aloud
the
answer
is
sufficient
said
peter
dryly
never
mind
son
when
with
our
heads
put
together
we
get
our
buildings
and
land
fixed
right
i
suggest
that
we
also
fix
our
clothes
and
our
belongings
right
i
ca
see
any
reason
why
a
woman
as
lovely
as
ma
should
be
told
from
any
other
pretty
woman
by
her
walk
or
dress
i
do
know
why
a
man
as
well
set
up
as
i
am
should
wear
his
clothes
as
easy
as
the
men
at
the
club
house
i
ca
see
why
we
should
be
at
that
same
club
house
for
a
meal
once
in
a
while
just
to
keep
us
satisfied
with
home
cooking
and
that
game
looks
interesting
next
trip
to
multiopolis
i
make
i
going
to
get
saddles
for
junior
and
mickey
and
teach
them
what
i
know
about
how
to
sit
and
handle
a
horse
properly
and
it
need
be
a
plow
horse
either
next
day
off
i
have
i
going
to
spend
hauling
lumber
to
one
of
these
lakes
we
decide
on
to
build
a
house
for
a
launch
and
for
us
then
when
we
have
a
vacation
drive
there
shelter
our
car
and
enjoy
ourselves
like
the
city
folks
by
the
thousand
since
we
think
what
they
do
so
right
and
fine
showed
us
what
they
like
flocking
five
thousand
at
a
clip
to
red
wing
lake
a
few
miles
from
us
since
we
live
among
what
they
are
spending
their
thousands
every
summer
to
enjoy
let
help
ourselves
to
a
little
pleasure
i
am
going
to
buy
each
of
us
a
fishing
rod
and
get
a
box
of
tackle
soon
as
i
reach
it
and
i
going
fast
i
wasted
sixteen
years
now
i
on
the
homestretch
and
it
going
to
be
a
stretch
of
all
there
is
in
me
to
make
our
home
the
sweetest
grandest
place
on
earth
to
us
will
you
help
me
nancy
i
think
maybe
i
be
saved
nervous
prostration
if
i
can
help
just
a
few
of
these
things
to
take
place
yes
i
sensed
that
said
peter
mickey
pointed
that
out
to
me
the
morning
you
jumped
your
job
and
headed
for
sunup
for
years
just
your
time
and
strength
has
been
thrown
away
using
old
methods
and
implements
in
your
work
and
having
the
kitchen
unhandy
and
inconvenient
and
i
the
man
who
should
have
seen
it
and
got
you
right
tools
for
your
job
at
the
same
time
i
bought
a
houseful
for
myself
and
my
we
must
stir
up
this
whole
neighbourhood
and
build
a
big
entertainment
house
where
we
can
have
a
library
suitable
for
country
folks
and
satisfying
to
their
ways
of
life
it
got
to
have
music
boxes
in
it
and
a
floor
fit
for
dancing
and
skating
and
a
stage
for
our
own
entertainments
and
the
folks
we
decide
to
bring
here
to
amuse
us
we
can
put
in
a
picture
machine
and
a
screen
that
we
can
pay
for
by
charging
a
few
cents
admission
the
nights
we
run
it
and
rent
films
once
or
twice
a
week
from
a
good
city
show
we
could
fix
up
a
place
like
that
and
get
no
end
of
fun
and
education
out
of
it
without
going
thirty
miles
and
spending
enough
money
in
one
night
to
get
better
entertainment
for
a
month
at
home
and
in
a
cool
comfortable
hall
and
where
we
can
go
from
it
to
bed
in
a
few
minutes
once
i
am
started
with
mickey
and
junior
to
help
me
i
going
to
call
a
meeting
and
talk
these
things
over
with
my
neighbours
and
get
them
to
join
in
if
i
can
if
i
ca
i
go
on
and
put
up
the
building
and
start
things
as
i
think
they
should
be
and
charge
enough
admittance
to
get
back
what
i
invest
and
after
that
just
enough
to
pay
running
expenses
and
for
the
talent
we
use
i
so
sure
it
can
be
done
going
to
do
it
will
you
help
me
son
yes
father
i
think
it
was
fine
to
help
do
that
said
junior
may
i
say
what
i
want
to
why
yes
you
might
son
said
peter
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
see
that
you
have
anything
to
say
if
you
have
got
the
idea
junior
that
you
have
wronged
us
any
and
that
it
your
job
to
ask
us
to
forgive
you
for
wanting
to
try
the
things
we
started
and
kept
you
hankering
after
all
your
life
so
far
why
you
mistaken
if
trained
you
from
your
cradle
to
love
your
home
as
i
trained
you
to
love
multiopolis
you
never
would
have
left
us
so
if
there
is
forgiving
in
the
air
you
please
forgive
me
and
this
includes
your
ma
as
well
i
should
ask
her
forgiveness
too
for
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
i
bungled
about
when
i
thought
i
was
loving
her
all
i
possibly
could
i
got
a
new
idea
of
love
so
big
and
it
includes
a
fireless
cooker
and
a
machine
i
going
to
put
it
in
practice
for
a
year
then
if
my
family
wants
to
change
back
we
talk
about
it
but
father
began
junior
go
to
bed
son
said
peter
you
can
tell
us
what
happened
when
you
ai
as
sleepy
as
you
are
right
now
junior
arose
and
followed
his
mother
to
the
kitchen
ai
he
going
to
let
me
tell
what
a
fool
i
been
at
all
he
demanded
i
guess
your
pa
felt
that
when
he
got
through
telling
what
fools
been
there
was
anything
left
for
you
to
say
i
know
i
feel
that
way
this
neighbourhood
does
all
in
its
power
from
the
day
their
children
are
born
to
teach
them
that
is
only
a
to
eat
and
sleep
and
work
and
be
sick
in
and
that
every
desirable
thing
in
life
is
to
be
found
the
else
being
in
most
cases
multiopolis
just
look
at
it
year
after
year
gobbling
up
our
boys
and
girls
and
think
over
the
ones
you
know
who
have
gone
and
see
what
they
come
to
among
the
men
as
far
as
i
remember
joel
harris
went
into
a
law
office
and
made
a
rich
respectable
man
and
two
girls
married
and
have
good
homes
the
others
many
of
them
i
could
name
to
you
the
places
they
are
in
this
neighbourhood
needs
reforming
and
if
pa
has
set
out
to
attempt
it
i
lend
a
hand
and
i
guess
from
what
you
got
this
week
you
be
in
a
position
to
help
better
than
you
could
have
helped
before
yes
i
guess
so
too
said
junior
emphatically
he
gladly
went
back
to
the
cream
wagon
peter
did
want
him
to
but
there
was
a
change
in
junior
he
was
no
longer
a
wilful
discontented
boy
he
was
a
partner
who
was
greatly
interested
in
a
business
and
felt
dissatisfied
if
he
were
not
working
at
furthering
it
he
had
little
to
say
but
his
eyes
were
looking
far
ahead
in
deep
thought
the
first
morning
he
started
out
while
junior
unhitched
his
horse
peter
filled
the
wagon
and
went
back
to
the
barn
where
mickey
was
helping
him
junior
passing
remembered
he
had
promised
jud
jason
to
bring
a
bundle
he
had
left
there
and
stopped
for
it
he
stepped
into
the
small
front
door
and
bent
for
the
package
lying
in
sight
when
clearly
and
distinctly
arose
mickey
voice
lifted
to
reach
peter
at
another
task
course
i
meant
him
to
get
enough
to
make
him
good
and
sick
of
it
like
we
agreed
on
but
i
never
intended
him
to
get
any
such
a
dose
as
he
had
junior
straightened
swiftly
and
his
lower
jaw
dropped
his
reply
was
equally
audible
of
course
i
understand
mickey
surest
thing
you
know
said
mickey
i
like
junior
i
like
him
better
than
any
other
boy
i
ever
knew
and
i
known
hundreds
i
tell
you
peter
he
was
gamer
than
you
ever
believe
to
hang
on
as
long
as
he
did
yes
i
think
that
too
said
peter
you
know
he
did
come
because
he
was
all
in
explained
mickey
you
can
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
that
he
about
been
the
limit
when
he
quit
and
he
quit
not
because
he
was
robbed
and
knocked
out
but
because
what
he
had
seen
showed
him
that
multiopolis
was
the
job
he
wanted
for
a
life
sentence
see
i
hope
you
are
right
about
that
said
peter
i
glad
to
my
soul
to
get
him
home
cured
in
any
way
but
it
sort
of
gags
me
to
think
of
him
as
having
been
scared
out
it
salves
my
vanity
considerable
to
feel
as
you
say
that
he
had
the
brains
to
sense
the
situation
and
quit
because
he
felt
it
was
the
work
for
which
he
was
born
then
mickey
voice
came
eagerly
earnestly
warming
the
cockles
of
junior
heart
now
lem
me
tell
you
peter
i
was
there
and
i
it
that
way
was
just
that
way
exact
he
was
scared
out
he
have
gone
at
it
again
all
right
if
he
seen
anything
in
it
he
it
was
just
as
his
mother
felt
when
she
first
talked
it
over
with
me
and
the
same
with
you
later
that
if
he
got
to
the
city
and
got
right
up
against
earning
a
living
there
he
would
find
it
was
what
he
wanted
and
he
did
like
all
of
us
thought
course
i
meant
to
put
it
to
him
stiff
i
meant
to
him
in
the
ancient
and
honourable
third
degree
of
multiopolis
all
right
so
he
have
enough
to
last
a
lifetime
but
i
only
meant
to
put
him
up
against
what
i
had
myself
on
the
streets
i
was
just
going
to
test
his
ginger
i
was
counting
on
the
robbing
and
the
alleys
and
the
knockout
and
the
morgue
gee
peter
then
they
laughed
a
dull
red
surged
up
junior
neck
and
flooded
his
face
he
picked
up
the
bundle
went
silently
from
the
barn
and
climbed
on
the
wagon
the
jerk
of
the
horse
stopping
at
its
accustomed
place
told
him
when
to
load
the
first
can
he
had
been
thinking
so
deeply
he
was
utterly
oblivious
to
everything
save
the
thought
that
it
had
been
prearranged
among
them
to
cure
him
even
his
mother
knew
about
if
he
heard
aright
had
been
the
instigator
of
the
scheme
to
let
him
go
to
be
what
mickey
called
initiated
in
the
ancient
and
honourable
third
degree
of
multiopolis
once
he
felt
so
outraged
he
thought
of
starting
the
horse
home
taking
the
trolley
going
back
to
multiopolis
and
fighting
his
way
to
what
his
father
would
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
success
he
knew
that
he
could
do
it
he
was
on
the
point
of
vowing
that
he
do
it
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
better
than
any
one
else
how
repulsed
he
was
how
he
hated
it
and
against
a
vision
of
weary
years
of
fighting
came
that
other
vision
of
himself
planning
and
working
beside
his
father
to
change
and
improve
their
home
life
say
junior
are
you
asleep
called
jud
jason
you
sit
there
like
you
could
move
d
bring
my
bundle
yes
it
back
there
answered
junior
get
it
how
you
like
multiopolis
asked
jud
junior
knew
he
had
that
to
face
it
a
sell
jud
he
said
promptly
i
glad
i
went
when
i
did
and
found
out
for
myself
you
see
it
like
this
jud
i
have
stayed
and
made
my
way
but
i
found
out
in
a
few
days
that
i
would
give
a
snap
for
the
way
when
it
was
made
we
fellows
are
better
off
right
where
we
are
and
a
lot
of
us
are
ready
to
exactly
what
of
the
men
in
multiopolis
are
wild
to
now
let
me
tell
you
junior
told
him
and
through
putting
his
experience
into
words
he
eased
his
heart
and
cleared
his
brain
he
came
to
hints
of
great
and
things
that
were
going
to
happen
soon
there
was
just
a
possibility
that
jud
gleaned
an
idea
that
the
experience
in
multiopolis
had
brought
his
friend
home
to
astound
and
benefit
the
neighbourhood
at
any
rate
junior
picked
up
the
lines
with
all
the
sourness
gone
from
his
temperament
which
was
usually
sweet
except
that
one
phrase
of
mickey
and
the
laughter
suddenly
he
leaned
forward
jud
come
here
he
said
junior
began
to
speak
and
jud
began
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
the
boy
he
had
known
from
childhood
could
we
asked
junior
we
well
i
just
guess
we
when
queried
junior
this
afternoon
if
he
going
to
be
off
said
jud
well
i
do
know
what
his
plans
are
but
i
could
telephone
from
here
and
by
rustling
i
could
get
back
by
two
i
done
it
on
a
bet
where
will
we
go
and
what
for
to
atwater
fishing
is
good
enough
excuse
all
right
father
will
let
me
take
the
car
hayseed
is
walking
good
enough
to
suit
you
what
the
matter
with
the
elkhart
swale
atwater
marsh
and
the
woods
around
the
head
of
the
lake
hold
the
horse
till
i
run
in
and
him
when
he
came
down
the
walk
he
reported
he
wants
to
go
fishing
awful
bad
and
he
be
ready
by
two
that
all
settled
then
we
have
a
fine
time
bully
said
jud
laconically
and
started
to
the
house
of
another
friend
where
a
few
words
secured
a
boy
of
his
age
a
holiday
junior
drove
fast
as
he
dared
and
hurried
with
his
work
so
he
reached
home
a
little
before
two
where
he
found
mickey
with
poles
and
a
big
can
of
worms
ready
despite
the
pressing
offer
of
the
car
they
walked
in
order
to
show
mickey
the
country
which
he
was
eager
to
explore
on
foot
junior
said
the
sunfish
were
big
as
lunch
plates
at
atwater
the
perch
fine
and
often
if
you
caught
a
grasshopper
or
a
cricket
for
bait
you
got
a
big
bass
around
the
shore
and
if
they
had
the
luck
to
reach
the
lake
when
there
was
no
one
ahead
of
them
and
secured
a
boat
they
were
sure
of
taking
some
would
i
like
to
see
lily
eating
a
fish
i
caught
said
mickey
searching
the
grass
and
kicking
rotting
wood
as
he
saw
junior
doing
to
find
bass
bait
minnies
are
the
real
thing
explained
junior
when
we
get
the
scheme
father
laid
out
going
before
we
start
fishing
you
and
i
will
take
a
net
and
come
to
this
creek
and
catch
a
bucketful
of
right
bait
and
then
we
have
man
sport
for
sure
wo
it
be
great
exactly
what
the
plutes
are
doing
said
mickey
gee
junior
if
your
pa
does
all
the
things
he
said
he
was
going
to
you
be
a
plute
yourself
never
heard
him
say
anything
in
my
life
he
did
do
said
junior
and
did
you
notice
that
he
put
in
too
you
be
just
as
much
of
a
plute
as
i
will
not
on
your
bromide
said
mickey
he
is
father
and
you
be
in
business
with
him
i
just
be
along
sometimes
as
a
friend
maybe
i
usually
take
father
at
just
what
he
says
i
guess
he
means
you
to
stay
in
our
family
if
you
like
i
wonder
now
said
mickey
looks
like
it
to
me
father
and
mother
both
like
you
and
daffy
about
peaches
it
because
she
so
little
and
so
white
and
so
helpless
mickey
hastened
to
explain
and
so
awful
sweet
well
for
what
ever
it
is
it
said
junior
and
i
just
as
crazy
about
her
as
the
rest
look
out
kid
that
fellow
coming
right
at
us
junior
dashed
for
the
fence
while
mickey
lost
time
in
turning
to
see
what
that
fellow
might
be
so
he
faced
the
ram
that
had
practised
on
malcolm
minturn
with
lowered
head
the
ram
sprang
at
mickey
he
flew
in
air
and
it
butted
space
and
whirled
again
so
that
before
the
breath
was
fully
recovered
he
lifted
once
more
with
all
the
agility
learned
on
the
streets
of
multiopolis
but
that
time
the
broad
straw
hat
he
wore
to
protect
his
eyes
on
the
water
sailed
from
his
head
he
dropped
the
poles
and
as
the
ram
came
back
at
him
he
hit
it
squarely
in
the
face
with
the
bait
can
which
angered
rather
than
daunted
it
then
for
a
few
minutes
mickey
was
too
busy
to
know
exactly
what
happened
and
movements
were
too
quick
for
junior
when
he
saw
that
mickey
was
tiring
and
the
ram
was
not
he
caught
a
rail
from
the
fence
and
helped
subdue
the
ram
panting
they
climbed
the
fence
and
sat
resting
why
i
did
know
higgins
had
that
ram
said
junior
we
fellows
always
crossed
that
field
before
say
there
ai
much
in
that
sheep
pray
tell
me
why
in
the
pleasant
fields
you
lie
business
is
there
not
much
but
the
lie
said
mickey
earnestly
junior
dropped
from
the
fence
and
led
the
way
toward
a
wood
thick
with
underbrush
laughing
until
his
heart
pained
as
they
proceeded
they
heard
voices
why
that
sounds
like
my
bunch
said
junior
he
whistled
shrilly
which
brought
an
immediate
response
and
soon
two
boys
appeared
hello
said
junior
hello
answered
they
where
you
going
asked
junior
to
atwater
lake
fishing
where
you
there
too
said
junior
why
great
we
go
together
sam
this
is
mickey
mickey
offered
his
hand
and
formalities
were
over
but
i
threw
our
worms
at
the
ram
said
mickey
well
that
was
a
smart
trick
cried
junior
was
it
agreed
mickey
but
you
see
the
ram
was
coming
and
i
had
the
worms
in
my
strong
right
so
i
did
stop
to
think
i
spent
an
hour
digging
them
i
just
whaled
away
never
mind
worms
said
jud
i
guess
we
got
enough
to
divide
if
you
fellows
want
to
furnish
something
for
your
share
you
can
find
some
grubs
in
these
woods
and
we
get
more
chance
at
the
bass
sure
said
mickey
what
are
grubs
and
where
do
you
look
for
them
oh
anywhere
under
rotting
wood
and
round
old
logs
said
jud
it
a
good
place
right
here
mickey
dig
in
till
i
cut
a
stick
to
help
with
mickey
pushed
aside
the
bushes
dropped
on
his
knees
and
dug
in
a
second
later
with
a
wild
shriek
he
rolled
over
and
over
striking
and
screaming
yellow
jackets
shouted
jud
quick
fellers
help
mickey
he
got
too
close
to
a
nest
armed
with
branches
they
came
beating
the
air
and
him
until
mickey
had
a
fleeting
thought
that
if
the
needles
piercing
him
did
not
kill
the
boys
would
presently
he
found
himself
beside
a
mudhole
and
as
the
others
ouched
and
and
bewailed
their
fate
and
grabbed
mud
and
plastered
it
on
he
did
the
same
jud
generously
offered
as
he
had
not
so
many
stings
to
help
mickey
soon
even
the
adoring
eyes
of
peaches
could
not
have
told
her
idol
from
the
mudhole
he
twisted
away
from
an
approaching
handful
crying
gee
jud
leave
a
feller
room
to
breathe
if
you
are
going
to
smother
me
i
might
as
well
die
from
bites
bites
cried
the
boys
while
all
of
them
laughed
wildly
so
wildly
that
mickey
flushed
with
shame
to
think
he
had
so
little
appreciation
of
the
fun
calling
a
sting
a
bite
when
it
was
explained
to
him
well
they
sure
do
get
down
to
business
he
chattered
chilling
from
the
exquisite
pain
of
a
dozen
stings
one
of
which
on
his
left
eyelid
was
rapidly
closing
that
important
organ
he
bowed
a
willing
head
for
jud
application
of
cold
mud
finally
they
gathered
up
their
poles
and
bait
and
again
started
toward
the
lake
the
day
was
warm
and
there
was
little
air
in
the
marsh
and
on
the
swampy
shore
they
followed
suddenly
jud
cried
i
tell
you
fellows
what
the
use
of
walking
all
the
way
round
the
lake
bet
the
boats
will
be
taken
when
we
get
there
let
cut
fishing
and
go
swimming
right
here
where
there
a
cool
shady
place
it
will
be
good
for
you
mickey
it
will
cool
off
your
stings
a
lot
mickey
promptly
began
to
unbutton
and
the
others
did
the
same
then
they
made
their
way
through
the
swamp
tangle
lining
the
shore
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
tried
to
reach
the
water
beside
the
tamaracks
sam
and
junior
found
solid
footing
and
waded
toward
deep
water
jud
piloted
mickey
to
a
spot
he
thought
sufficiently
treacherous
and
said
looks
good
here
you
go
ahead
mickey
and
i
come
after
you
mickey
was
unaccustomed
to
the
water
he
waded
in
with
the
assurance
he
had
seen
the
others
use
but
suddenly
he
cried
gee
boys
i
sucking
right
down
then
on
his
ears
fell
a
deafening
clamour
help
help
quicksands
mickey
sinking
help
him
mickey
threw
out
his
arms
he
grabbed
wildly
while
a
force
seemingly
gentle
but
irresistible
sucked
him
lower
and
lower
and
with
each
inch
it
bore
him
down
gripped
tighter
and
pulled
faster
when
he
glanced
at
the
boys
he
saw
panic
in
their
faces
and
he
realized
that
he
was
probably
lost
and
they
were
terror
stricken
the
first
gulp
of
tepid
shore
water
that
strangled
him
in
running
across
his
gasping
lips
made
him
think
of
peaches
struggling
he
threw
back
his
head
and
so
saw
a
widespreading
branch
of
a
big
maple
not
far
above
him
all
that
was
left
of
mickey
went
into
the
cry
junior
bend
me
that
branch
junior
swiftly
climbed
the
tree
crept
on
the
limb
and
swayed
it
till
it
swept
the
water
then
mickey
laid
hold
just
a
few
twigs
and
then
as
junior
backed
and
the
branch
lifted
higher
and
higher
mickey
worked
hand
over
hand
and
finally
grasped
twigs
that
promised
to
stand
a
gentle
pull
then
jud
began
to
shout
instructions
little
lower
junior
get
a
better
grip
before
you
pull
hard
mickey
maple
is
brittle
easy
it
will
snap
with
you
kind
of
roll
yourself
and
turn
to
let
the
water
in
and
loosen
the
sand
now
roll
again
now
pull
a
little
you
making
it
you
are
out
to
your
shoulders
back
farther
junior
do
you
fall
in
or
you
both
go
down
mickey
was
very
quiet
now
his
small
face
was
pallid
with
the
terror
of
leaving
peaches
forever
with
no
provision
for
her
safety
the
grip
of
the
sucking
sand
was
yet
pulling
at
his
legs
and
body
while
if
the
branch
broke
he
knew
what
it
meant
that
sucking
insistent
pulling
and
caving
away
beneath
his
feet
told
him
suddenly
mickey
gave
up
struggling
set
his
teeth
and
began
fighting
by
instinct
he
moved
his
shoulders
gently
until
he
let
the
water
flow
in
then
instead
of
trying
to
work
his
feet
he
held
them
rigid
and
flattened
as
he
could
and
with
the
upper
part
of
his
body
still
rolling
he
reached
higher
and
kept
inching
up
the
branch
as
junior
backed
away
until
with
sickening
slowness
he
at
last
reached
wood
thick
as
his
wrist
then
he
dragged
his
helpless
body
after
him
to
safety
where
he
sank
in
a
heap
to
rest
jud
it
a
good
thing
i
went
in
there
first
he
said
heavy
as
you
are
you
at
the
bottom
by
now
if
there
any
bottom
mickey
gaze
travelled
slowly
over
his
lumpy
purple
frame
and
then
he
looked
closely
at
the
others
why
them
stingers
must
about
all
of
it
to
me
he
commented
i
do
see
any
lumps
on
the
rest
of
you
oh
we
are
used
to
it
scoffed
jud
they
do
show
on
you
after
you
get
used
to
them
most
all
mine
are
on
my
head
i
kept
off
with
the
bushes
so
did
i
chimed
in
sam
and
junior
with
one
voice
i
guess
i
did
get
a
lot
the
worst
of
it
conceded
mickey
but
if
they
only
stung
your
heads
it
funny
you
did
know
where
to
put
your
mud
well
i
tell
you
said
jud
earnestly
on
your
head
they
hurt
worst
of
all
they
hurt
so
blame
bad
you
get
so
wild
like
you
do
know
where
you
stung
and
you
think
till
you
cool
off
a
little
you
got
them
all
over
yes
i
guess
you
do
agreed
mickey
the
boys
were
slowly
putting
on
their
clothing
and
junior
was
scowling
darkly
jud
edged
close
gosh
he
whispered
i
thought
it
was
only
a
little
spring
i
think
it
was
a
quicksand
you
cut
out
anything
more
said
junior
tersely
jud
nodded
after
a
while
they
started
home
walking
slowly
and
each
one
being
particularly
careful
of
and
good
to
mickey
when
he
had
rested
he
could
see
that
it
was
only
an
accident
such
an
astounding
one
he
forgot
his
bites
and
could
talk
of
little
else
they
made
another
long
pause
under
a
big
tree
and
mickey
felt
so
much
better
as
they
again
started
home
that
junior
lagged
behind
and
jud
seeing
joined
him
junior
asked
softly
have
any
more
jud
nodded
what
whispered
junior
jud
told
him
oh
that
nothing
in
that
go
on
so
they
struck
into
the
path
they
had
followed
from
the
swamp
to
the
woods
when
suddenly
a
warm
yielding
coiling
thing
slipped
under
mickey
feet
with
a
wild
cry
he
leaped
across
the
body
of
a
big
rattlesnake
that
had
been
coiled
in
the
path
as
he
arose
clear
cut
against
the
light
launched
the
ugly
head
and
wide
jaws
of
the
rattler
then
came
the
sickening
buzz
of
its
rattles
in
mad
recoil
for
a
second
stroke
run
mickey
jump
screamed
junior
what
is
it
asked
mickey
bewildered
rattlesnakes
sure
death
yelled
jud
run
fool
but
mickey
stood
perfectly
still
and
looked
not
where
the
increasing
buzz
came
from
but
at
them
they
had
no
choice
jud
carried
a
heavy
club
he
threw
himself
in
front
of
mickey
and
as
the
second
stroke
came
he
swung
at
the
snake
head
the
other
boys
collected
their
senses
and
beat
it
to
pulp
then
the
dead
mate
it
watched
beside
junior
glared
at
jud
but
when
he
saw
how
frightened
he
was
he
knew
what
had
happened
mickey
gazed
at
the
snakes
in
horror
ai
that
a
pretty
small
parcel
to
deal
out
sudden
death
in
he
asked
and
if
they
laying
round
like
that
ai
we
taking
an
awful
risk
to
be
wading
through
here
this
way
gee
they
the
worst
sight
i
ever
saw
mickey
became
violently
ill
he
lay
down
for
a
time
while
the
boys
waited
on
him
and
at
last
when
he
could
slowly
walk
toward
home
they
went
on
jud
and
sam
left
them
at
the
creek
and
junior
and
mickey
started
up
the
harding
lane
suddenly
mickey
sat
down
in
a
fence
corner
leaned
against
the
rails
and
closed
his
eyes
gee
he
said
never
felt
so
rotten
in
all
my
life
maybe
that
snake
grazed
you
if
it
did
would
it
kill
me
asked
mickey
dully
well
after
the
poison
in
your
blood
and
being
so
tired
and
hot
you
would
stand
the
chance
you
had
when
we
first
started
said
junior
do
you
know
where
it
came
closest
to
you
back
of
my
legs
i
said
mickey
if
it
had
hit
you
it
would
leave
two
places
like
needles
stuck
in
just
the
width
of
its
head
apart
i
ca
find
that
looks
like
it
thank
the
lord
here
too
said
mickey
you
see
if
it
or
the
quicksands
had
finished
me
i
have
things
fixed
for
lily
they
might
her
yet
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
she
would
be
left
with
no
one
to
take
care
of
her
father
would
offered
junior
mother
never
would
let
anybody
take
her
i
know
she
would
well
i
do
said
mickey
and
here
is
where
guessing
does
cut
any
ice
i
must
be
i
ask
him
i
like
to
know
how
it
happens
that
sudden
death
has
just
been
rampaging
after
me
all
this
trip
anyway
i
seemed
to
get
it
coming
or
going
junior
did
not
hide
his
grin
quickly
enough
grated
mickey
suddenly
tense
and
alert
he
sprang
to
his
feet
so
did
junior
say
look
here
cried
mickey
all
right
here
retorted
junior
his
face
flamed
ted
then
paled
and
his
hands
gripped
while
his
jaw
protruded
in
an
ugly
scowl
then
slowly
and
distinctly
he
quoted
course
i
meant
to
put
it
to
you
stiff
i
meant
to
you
in
the
ancient
and
honourable
third
degree
of
the
country
all
right
so
you
have
enough
to
last
a
lifetime
but
i
only
meant
to
put
you
up
against
what
i
had
myself
in
the
fields
and
woods
i
was
just
going
to
test
your
ginger
i
counting
on
the
and
the
snake
finding
its
dead
mate
jud
fixed
for
you
so
you
were
sneaking
in
the
barn
this
morning
when
we
thought
you
were
gone
demanded
mickey
easy
you
cautioned
junior
going
after
the
bundle
i
promised
jud
was
sneaking
so
was
conceded
mickey
instantly
so
was
he
looked
at
junior
a
second
you
heard
us
then
he
demanded
all
of
it
i
do
know
answered
junior
i
heard
what
i
just
repeated
and
what
you
said
about
my
being
game
and
exactly
why
i
came
back
thank
you
for
even
if
i
lick
you
half
to
death
in
a
minute
and
i
heard
that
my
own
mother
first
fixed
it
up
with
you
and
then
father
agreed
oh
i
heard
enough
and
so
you
got
a
grouch
commented
mickey
yes
i
did
admitted
junior
but
i
got
over
all
of
it
after
i
had
time
to
think
but
that
third
degree
business
that
made
me
so
sore
i
told
jud
about
it
and
he
said
he
help
me
pay
you
up
but
we
struck
the
same
rock
you
did
in
giving
you
a
bigger
dose
than
we
meant
to
honest
mickey
jud
did
know
there
was
a
quicksand
there
and
of
course
we
did
dream
a
live
snake
would
follow
and
find
the
one
the
boys
hunted
killed
and
set
for
you
this
morning
awful
innocent
scoffed
mickey
you
did
know
about
the
ram
either
honest
i
mickey
persisted
junior
i
thought
steering
you
into
the
yellow
jackets
was
to
be
the
first
degree
cross
my
heart
i
did
suddenly
mickey
whooped
he
tumbled
on
the
grass
in
the
fence
corner
and
twisted
in
wild
laughter
until
he
was
worn
out
then
he
struggled
up
and
held
out
his
hand
to
junior
if
you
willing
he
said
i
give
you
the
grip
and
the
password
will
be
chapter
xviii
and
the
hermit
dovesky
i
want
a
minute
with
you
said
james
minturn
all
right
minturn
what
is
it
you
are
well
acquainted
with
mrs
minturn
very
well
indeed
said
dovesky
i
have
had
the
honour
of
working
with
her
in
many
concerts
and
of
her
musical
ability
you
are
convinced
brilliant
is
the
only
word
exclaimed
the
professor
my
reason
for
asking
is
this
said
minturn
one
of
our
boys
the
second
malcolm
is
like
his
mother
and
lately
we
discovered
that
he
has
her
gift
in
music
we
ran
on
it
through
miss
leslie
winton
who
interested
minturn
in
certain
wild
birds
yes
i
know
cried
the
professor
eagerly
when
she
became
certain
that
she
had
heard
a
i
think
she
said
song
sparrow
sing
di
provenza
from
traviata
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
until
she
felt
that
verdi
copied
the
bird
or
the
bird
copied
the
master
she
told
my
wife
and
nellie
was
greatly
interested
yes
i
know
repeated
the
musician
she
stopped
here
one
day
in
passing
and
told
me
what
she
had
heard
from
miss
winton
she
asked
me
if
i
thought
there
were
enough
in
the
subject
to
pay
for
spending
a
day
investigating
it
i
knew
very
little
but
on
the
chance
that
she
would
have
a
more
profitable
time
in
the
woods
than
in
society
i
strongly
urged
her
to
go
she
heard
enough
to
convince
her
for
shortly
after
leaving
for
her
usual
summer
trip
she
wrote
me
twice
concerning
it
you
mean
she
wrote
you
about
studying
bird
music
yes
said
the
professor
the
first
letter
if
i
remember
came
from
boston
where
she
found
much
progress
had
been
made
there
she
heard
of
a
man
who
had
gone
into
the
subject
more
deeply
than
any
one
ever
before
had
investigated
and
written
a
book
her
second
letter
was
from
the
country
near
boston
where
she
had
gone
to
study
under
his
direction
i
have
thought
about
taking
it
up
myself
at
odd
times
this
spring
that
is
why
i
am
here
said
minturn
i
want
you
to
begin
at
once
and
go
as
far
as
you
are
able
taking
malcolm
with
you
the
boys
have
been
spending
much
of
their
time
in
the
country
lately
hiding
in
blinds
selecting
a
bird
and
practising
its
notes
until
they
copy
them
so
perfectly
they
induce
it
to
answer
they
are
proud
as
pompey
when
they
succeed
and
it
teaches
them
to
recognize
the
birds
i
believe
this
is
setting
their
feet
in
the
right
way
but
malcolm
has
gone
so
fast
and
so
far
that
he
may
be
reproducing
some
of
the
most
wonderful
of
the
songs
for
all
i
know
for
the
birds
come
peering
calling
searching
even
to
the
very
branch
which
conceals
him
is
it
enough
for
a
beginning
certainly
said
the
musician
he
been
badly
spoiled
by
women
servants
said
minturn
but
the
men
are
taking
that
out
of
him
as
fast
as
it
can
be
eliminated
i
believe
he
is
interested
enough
to
work
i
think
his
mother
will
be
delighted
on
her
return
to
find
him
working
at
what
she
so
enjoys
does
the
proposition
interest
you
deeply
cried
the
professor
matters
musical
are
extremely
dull
here
now
and
i
ca
make
my
usual
trip
abroad
on
account
of
the
war
i
should
be
delighted
to
take
up
this
new
subject
which
i
could
make
serve
me
in
many
ways
with
my
advanced
conservatory
pupils
may
i
make
a
suggestion
asked
minturn
most
assuredly
exclaimed
the
professor
you
noticed
i
began
by
admitting
i
did
know
a
thing
about
it
so
i
not
be
at
all
offended
if
you
indorse
the
statement
my
boys
are
large
and
old
for
the
beginning
they
must
make
i
have
to
go
carefully
to
find
what
they
care
for
and
will
work
at
so
that
i
get
them
started
without
making
them
feel
confined
and
forced
and
so
conceive
a
dislike
for
the
study
to
which
i
think
them
best
adapted
would
you
find
the
idea
of
going
to
the
country
putting
a
tuned
violin
in
the
hands
of
the
lad
and
letting
him
search
for
the
notes
he
hears
and
then
playing
the
composers
selections
to
him
and
giving
his
ear
a
chance
at
all
feasible
it
a
reversal
but
he
could
try
it
very
well
then
said
minturn
rising
all
i
stipulate
is
that
you
allow
the
other
boys
and
the
tutor
to
go
along
and
assimilate
what
they
can
and
that
when
you
not
occupied
with
malcolm
their
tutor
shall
have
a
chance
to
work
in
what
he
can
in
the
way
of
spelling
numbers
and
nature
study
is
it
a
bargain
a
most
delightful
one
on
my
part
minturn
said
dovesky
when
shall
i
begin
whenever
you
have
selected
the
instrument
you
want
the
boy
to
have
call
tower
at
my
residence
and
arrange
with
him
to
come
for
you
said
minturn
you
ca
start
too
soon
to
suit
the
boy
or
me
very
well
then
i
make
my
plans
and
call
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
said
the
professor
james
minturn
went
home
and
told
what
he
had
done
wo
that
be
great
malcolm
cried
james
maybe
you
can
do
the
music
so
well
you
can
be
a
birdman
and
stand
upon
a
stage
before
a
thousand
people
and
make
all
of
them
think
you
a
bird
i
believe
i
like
to
do
it
said
malcolm
if
i
find
out
the
people
who
make
music
have
gone
and
copied
in
what
the
birds
sing
and
told
they
did
it
i
tell
on
them
it
no
fair
way
of
course
the
birds
sang
their
songs
before
men
did
they
father
i
think
so
but
i
ca
prove
it
said
minturn
can
you
prove
it
mr
tower
asked
malcolm
yes
said
tower
science
proves
that
the
water
forms
developed
first
crickets
were
singing
before
the
birds
and
both
before
man
appeared
then
that
what
i
think
said
malcolm
when
are
they
to
begin
james
asked
winslow
dovesky
is
to
call
tower
in
the
morning
and
tell
him
what
arrangements
he
has
been
able
to
make
answered
minturn
malcolm
you
are
old
enough
to
recognize
that
he
is
a
great
man
and
it
is
a
big
thing
for
him
to
leave
his
conservatory
and
his
work
and
go
to
the
woods
to
help
teach
one
small
boy
what
the
birds
say
you
be
very
polite
and
obey
him
instantly
will
you
not
do
i
have
to
mind
him
just
like
he
was
mr
tower
i
do
think
you
are
obeying
tower
because
you
must
said
aunt
margaret
seems
to
me
i
saw
you
with
your
arms
around
his
neck
last
night
and
i
think
i
heard
you
tell
him
that
you
give
him
all
your
money
except
for
your
violin
if
he
would
go
away
this
winter
honestly
malcolm
do
you
obey
tower
because
you
feel
forced
to
no
cried
malcolm
we
have
dandy
times
and
we
are
learning
a
lot
too
i
wonder
if
dovesky
will
join
our
campfire
very
probably
he
be
eager
to
said
winslow
and
more
than
likely
you
obey
him
just
as
you
do
father
and
tower
because
you
love
to
father
are
william
and
i
going
to
study
the
birds
asked
james
if
you
like
said
minturn
it
would
please
me
greatly
if
each
of
you
would
try
hard
to
understand
what
dovesky
teaches
malcolm
and
to
learn
all
of
it
you
can
and
to
produce
creditable
bird
calls
if
possible
and
of
course
these
days
you
not
really
educated
unless
you
know
the
birds
flowers
and
animals
around
you
it
is
now
a
component
and
delightful
part
of
life
gee
it
a
pity
mother
is
here
said
malcolm
i
bet
she
knows
more
about
it
than
mr
dovesky
i
bet
she
does
too
agreed
james
but
she
would
go
where
we
do
there
is
a
party
there
and
if
a
mosquito
bit
her
she
have
a
fit
aw
she
would
if
she
wanted
to
insisted
malcolm
well
she
would
to
said
james
well
she
might
smarty
said
malcolm
she
did
once
i
saw
the
boots
and
skirt
she
was
going
to
wear
do
you
wish
she
liked
the
things
we
do
better
than
parties
father
yes
i
wish
she
did
said
minturn
maybe
she
will
if
she
hear
me
call
the
quail
and
the
she
like
it
said
malcolm
she
would
like
it
well
enough
to
stay
away
from
a
party
to
go
with
you
to
hear
it
said
james
she
might
persisted
malcolm
she
did
know
about
this
when
she
went
to
the
parties
when
she
comes
back
i
going
to
tell
her
and
going
to
take
her
to
hear
me
and
i
show
her
the
flowers
and
my
and
yours
and
father
would
it
be
fun
if
she
wear
the
boots
again
and
make
a
too
yes
she
wear
boots
scoffed
james
well
she
would
if
she
wanted
to
reiterated
malcolm
she
wore
them
when
she
wanted
to
hear
the
birds
if
she
did
once
she
would
again
if
she
pleased
well
she
would
please
laughed
james
well
she
said
malcolm
stubbornly
might
she
father
if
she
went
once
i
see
no
reason
why
she
should
again
said
minturn
course
she
go
again
triumphed
malcolm
i
make
her
when
she
comes
yes
she
comes
jeered
james
she
wo
ever
live
here
she
would
think
this
was
good
enough
for
lucette
and
gretchen
and
she
gave
away
our
house
for
the
sick
children
and
she
hates
it
at
grandmother
bet
she
does
ever
come
again
bet
she
does
said
malcolm
instantly
would
you
like
to
have
mother
come
here
malcolm
interrupted
minturn
quietly
why
he
said
and
shifted
his
questioning
gaze
toward
aunt
margaret
why
why
well
i
tell
you
father
if
she
would
wear
boots
and
go
see
the
birds
and
the
flowers
if
she
would
do
as
we
do
sometimes
in
the
night
i
wake
up
and
think
how
pretty
she
is
and
i
just
get
hungry
to
see
her
but
of
course
it
would
only
kick
up
a
row
for
her
to
come
here
of
course
she
better
stay
away
but
father
if
she
come
and
if
she
wear
the
boots
and
if
she
let
old
slapping
lucette
go
and
live
as
we
do
father
that
be
great
yes
i
think
it
would
said
james
minturn
conclusively
as
he
excused
himself
and
arose
from
the
table
james
said
malcolm
when
they
went
to
their
schoolroom
if
dovesky
goes
to
shutting
us
up
in
the
study
and
wo
let
us
play
while
we
learn
what
will
we
do
to
him
to
make
him
sick
of
his
job
oh
things
would
turn
up
replied
james
but
malcolm
would
you
kind
o
hate
to
have
him
see
you
be
mean
well
father
saw
us
be
mean
said
malcolm
yes
but
what
would
you
give
if
he
i
not
proud
of
it
replied
malcolm
yes
and
that
just
it
cried
james
that
just
what
comes
of
living
here
all
of
them
are
so
polite
and
if
you
are
halfway
decent
they
are
so
good
to
you
and
they
help
you
to
do
things
that
will
make
you
into
a
man
who
need
be
ashamed
of
himself
that
just
it
how
would
you
like
to
go
back
and
be
so
rough
and
so
mean
nobody
at
all
would
care
for
us
father
would
let
us
would
he
asked
malcolm
he
would
if
he
could
help
it
said
james
he
did
used
to
seem
as
if
he
could
help
it
do
you
remember
he
would
tell
us
it
was
not
the
right
way
and
try
to
have
us
be
decent
and
lucette
would
tell
mother
and
mother
would
fire
him
i
wonder
how
she
could
and
if
she
could
then
why
does
she
now
i
guess
he
does
want
to
stop
her
party
to
bother
with
us
but
if
she
ever
conies
and
wants
to
take
us
back
like
we
were
malcolm
i
not
going
i
what
we
got
now
mother
always
said
we
were
to
be
gentlemen
but
we
never
could
be
that
way
father
and
tower
and
dovesky
are
gentlemen
just
as
kind
and
easy
and
fine
when
we
were
mean
as
could
be
and
acted
like
you
remember
father
and
tower
only
us
they
did
get
mad
and
beat
us
if
mother
comes
you
may
go
with
her
if
you
want
to
i
wish
she
come
with
us
said
malcolm
not
mother
we
ai
her
kind
of
a
party
i
know
it
admitted
malcolm
slowly
sometimes
i
want
her
just
awful
i
wonder
why
i
guess
it
a
boy
is
born
wanting
his
mother
i
want
her
myself
a
lot
of
times
but
i
would
go
with
her
if
she
come
today
so
i
do
know
i
want
her
but
i
sometimes
i
did
know
you
did
said
malcolm
well
i
do
said
james
but
i
ai
ever
going
often
i
think
the
queerest
things
what
queer
things
do
you
think
james
why
like
this
said
james
that
it
ai
to
let
children
be
jerked
and
their
heads
knocked
you
know
what
lucette
did
to
elizabeth
i
think
she
hit
her
head
too
hard
she
gave
me
more
cake
and
said
i
was
a
good
boy
for
saying
the
ice
made
her
sick
but
all
the
time
i
thought
it
was
hitting
her
head
i
would
be
the
boy
who
said
that
again
if
i
had
to
be
shot
for
saying
it
like
the
french
boy
was
about
the
soldiers
that
day
yes
i
do
said
malcolm
shortly
you
know
you
coaxed
her
off
the
bench
and
i
pushed
her
in
said
james
slowly
yes
said
malcolm
and
i
kicked
her
and
i
was
mad
at
her
a
bit
i
wonder
i
did
it
i
guess
you
did
it
because
you
were
more
of
an
animal
than
a
decent
boy
same
as
i
pushed
her
said
james
i
guess
i
wo
ever
forget
that
i
pushed
her
pushing
her
was
as
bad
as
what
i
did
said
malcolm
i
guess
either
one
of
us
going
to
feel
right
about
elizabeth
again
long
as
we
live
malcolm
we
ca
get
her
back
said
james
but
if
any
way
happens
that
we
ever
get
another
little
sister
we
take
care
of
her
like
father
you
bet
we
will
said
malcolm
next
morning
the
boys
had
the
car
ready
they
packed
in
all
their
bird
books
their
flower
records
and
botanies
and
were
eagerly
waiting
when
the
call
from
dovesky
came
at
once
they
drove
to
his
home
for
him
and
from
there
to
a
music
store
where
a
violin
was
selected
for
malcolm
dovesky
was
so
big
the
boys
stood
in
awe
of
his
size
he
was
so
clean
no
boy
would
want
him
to
see
him
dirty
he
was
so
handsome
it
was
good
to
watch
his
face
because
you
had
to
like
him
when
he
smiled
he
was
so
polite
that
you
never
for
a
minute
forgot
that
soon
you
were
going
to
be
a
man
and
if
you
could
be
the
man
you
wished
you
would
be
exactly
like
him
both
boys
were
very
shy
of
him
and
very
much
afraid
his
entrance
into
their
party
would
spoil
their
fun
when
they
left
the
music
store
malcolm
carefully
carrying
his
new
violin
dovesky
his
and
a
roll
of
music
the
boys
with
anxious
hearts
awaited
developments
now
tower
said
dovesky
suppose
we
drive
wherever
you
are
likely
to
find
the
birds
you
have
been
practising
on
and
for
a
start
let
me
hear
just
what
you
have
done
and
can
do
and
then
i
can
plan
better
to
work
in
with
you
when
they
reached
the
brook
they
stopped
to
show
the
fish
pools
and
then
entered
an
old
orchard
long
abandoned
for
fruit
growing
and
so
worm
infested
as
to
make
it
a
bird
paradise
cuckoos
jays
robins
bluebirds
thrashers
orioles
sparrows
and
vireos
nested
there
singing
on
wing
among
the
trees
on
the
fences
and
from
bushes
in
the
corners
malcolm
and
dovesky
secreted
themselves
on
a
board
laid
across
the
rails
of
an
fence
corner
then
the
boy
began
pointing
out
the
birds
he
knew
and
giving
his
repetition
of
their
calls
cries
bits
of
song
sometimes
whistled
sometimes
half
spoken
half
whistled
any
vocal
rendition
that
would
produce
the
bird
tones
he
had
practised
carefully
he
was
slightly
excited
and
sooner
than
usual
he
received
replies
little
feathered
folk
came
peeping
peering
calling
and
beyond
question
answering
malcolm
notes
in
an
hour
dovesky
was
holding
his
breath
with
interest
suggesting
corrections
trying
notes
himself
and
when
he
felt
he
had
whistled
accurately
and
heard
a
bird
reply
he
was
as
proud
as
the
boy
then
a
thing
happened
that
none
of
them
had
mentioned
because
they
were
not
sure
enough
that
it
would
a
brown
thrush
catching
the
unusual
atmosphere
of
the
orchard
that
morning
selected
the
tallest
twig
of
an
apple
tree
and
showed
that
orchard
what
real
music
was
the
thrush
preened
flirted
his
feathers
opened
his
beak
widely
and
sang
his
first
liquid
notes
starts
on
c
commented
dovesky
softly
three
times
and
does
it
over
to
show
us
we
need
think
it
was
an
accident
and
he
ca
do
it
as
often
as
he
pleases
whispered
malcolm
dovesky
glanced
at
the
boy
and
nodded
there
he
goes
from
c
to
e
he
commented
an
instant
later
repeats
that
c
again
falls
to
b
up
to
g
repeats
that
i
wish
he
would
wait
till
i
get
my
pencil
i
can
give
it
to
you
said
malcolm
he
does
each
strain
over
as
soon
as
he
sings
it
i
know
his
song
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
dovesky
was
sketching
a
staff
of
music
in
natural
key
setting
off
measures
and
filling
in
notes
as
the
bird
confused
him
with
repetitions
or
trills
on
e
or
c
so
high
he
had
to
watch
sharply
to
catch
just
what
it
was
his
fingers
trembled
when
he
added
lines
to
the
staff
for
the
highest
notes
for
fifteen
minutes
the
blessed
bird
sang
and
at
each
rendition
of
its
full
strain
it
seemed
to
grow
more
intoxicated
with
its
own
performance
finishing
the
last
notes
perfectly
the
bird
gave
a
hop
glanced
around
as
if
he
were
saying
now
any
one
who
thinks
he
can
surpass
that
has
my
permission
to
try
from
a
bush
a
small
gray
bird
meouwed
in
derision
and
accepted
the
challenge
the
watchers
could
not
see
him
but
he
came
so
close
singing
the
same
song
that
he
deceived
dovesky
for
he
said
going
to
do
it
over
from
the
bushes
now
listen
cautioned
malcolm
do
you
hear
the
difference
he
starts
the
same
but
he
runs
higher
he
drops
lower
and
does
it
quicker
and
i
think
the
notes
clearer
and
sweeter
when
the
little
gray
fellow
sings
them
and
you
should
see
his
nest
do
you
like
him
better
humph
said
dovesky
why
i
was
so
entranced
with
the
first
performance
i
did
suppose
anything
could
be
better
i
must
have
time
to
learn
both
songs
and
analyze
and
compare
i
ca
do
gray
yet
said
malcolm
it
so
fine
and
cut
up
with
going
up
and
down
on
the
jump
but
i
got
the
start
of
it
and
the
part
that
goes
this
way
this
is
my
work
cried
dovesky
is
there
any
chance
the
bird
will
repeat
his
performance
mostly
he
does
till
evening
answered
malcolm
he
pretty
sure
to
again
morning
but
old
cat
of
the
bushes
he
sings
any
time
it
suits
him
all
day
his
nest
is
where
he
sings
and
he
does
ever
perch
up
so
high
and
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
but
i
think
mother
would
like
his
notes
best
first
said
dovesky
i
take
down
what
brown
bird
sang
and
learn
it
i
call
that
a
good
start
and
when
i
get
his
song
so
i
can
whistle
and
play
it
on
the
instruments
then
we
go
at
song
and
see
if
i
can
learn
why
and
in
what
way
you
think
it
finer
oh
it
goes
from
high
to
low
quicker
more
notes
in
a
bunch
and
sweeter
tones
trilling
explained
malcolm
dovesky
laughed
saying
in
a
question
of
music
that
would
constitute
quite
a
difference
they
went
to
the
brook
and
lunched
and
made
easy
records
of
syllabic
calls
that
could
be
rendered
in
words
and
by
whistling
then
all
of
them
gathered
around
dovesky
while
he
drew
lines
crossed
them
with
bands
and
explained
the
staff
and
different
time
and
signatures
and
together
they
had
their
first
music
lesson
malcolm
whistled
the
thrush
song
while
dovesky
copied
the
notes
tuned
the
violin
and
showed
the
boy
how
the
strings
corresponded
to
the
lines
he
had
made
where
the
notes
lay
on
them
and
how
to
draw
them
out
with
the
bow
he
could
not
explain
fast
enough
to
satisfy
the
eager
lad
after
dovesky
had
gone
as
far
as
he
thought
wise
and
left
off
with
music
he
wandered
with
tower
hunting
flowers
in
which
he
seemed
almost
as
much
interested
as
the
music
malcolm
clung
to
the
violin
and
over
and
over
ran
the
natural
scale
he
had
been
taught
then
slowly
softly
with
wavering
awkward
bow
he
began
whistling
plain
easy
calls
and
hunting
up
and
down
the
strings
for
them
that
day
was
the
beginning
others
did
not
dawn
fast
enough
to
suit
malcolm
while
the
ease
with
which
he
mastered
the
songs
of
the
orchard
and
reproduced
them
in
a
few
days
set
him
begging
to
be
taken
to
the
swamp
to
hear
the
bird
that
sang
from
the
book
leslie
winton
was
added
to
the
party
that
day
malcolm
came
from
the
land
of
the
tamarack
obsessed
james
william
and
the
tutor
did
not
care
for
that
location
but
malcolm
and
dovesky
wanted
to
erect
a
tent
and
take
provisions
and
their
instruments
and
live
among
the
dim
coolness
where
miracles
of
song
burst
on
the
air
at
any
moment
they
heard
and
identified
the
veery
they
went
on
their
knees
at
their
first
experience
with
the
clear
notes
of
the
wood
thrush
with
a
little
practice
malcolm
could
reproduce
the
song
from
the
book
he
talked
of
it
incessantly
sang
and
whistled
it
making
patent
to
every
member
of
the
family
that
what
was
in
his
heart
was
fully
as
much
a
desire
to
do
the
notes
so
literally
that
he
would
win
the
commendation
of
his
mother
as
to
obtain
an
answer
from
an
unsuspecting
bird
for
that
was
the
sport
the
big
thing
for
which
to
strive
they
worked
to
obtain
a
record
so
accurately
to
reproduce
it
so
perfectly
that
the
bird
making
it
would
answer
and
come
at
their
call
the
day
malcolm
hidden
in
the
tamarack
swamp
coaxed
the
sparrow
now
flitting
widely
in
feeding
its
young
he
knew
not
how
far
to
the
bush
sheltering
him
and
with
its
own
notes
set
it
singing
against
him
as
a
rival
the
boy
was
no
happier
than
dovesky
minturn
could
not
quite
agree
to
the
camp
at
the
swamp
but
he
provided
a
car
and
a
driver
and
allowed
them
to
go
each
morning
and
often
to
remain
late
at
night
to
practise
owl
and
nighthawk
calls
veery
notes
chat
cries
and
the
unsurpassed
melody
of
the
evening
vespers
of
the
hermit
bird
this
song
once
heard
comprehended
copied
and
reproduced
the
musician
and
the
boy
with
music
in
his
heart
brain
and
finger
tips
clung
to
each
other
and
suffered
the
exquisite
pain
of
the
artist
experiencing
joy
so
poignant
it
hurt
after
a
mastery
of
those
notes
as
to
time
tone
and
grouping
came
the
task
of
perfecting
them
so
that
the
bird
would
reply
hours
they
practised
until
far
in
the
night
and
when
malcolm
felt
he
really
had
located
a
bird
gained
its
attention
and
set
it
singing
against
him
he
was
wild
and
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
that
his
father
should
go
to
the
swamp
with
him
and
well
hidden
hear
and
see
that
he
called
the
bird
gladly
minturn
assented
whether
the
boy
succeeded
in
this
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
his
father
but
it
was
not
paramount
the
thing
that
concerned
him
most
was
that
malcolm
interest
in
what
he
was
doing
his
joy
in
the
study
he
was
making
had
bred
a
deep
regard
in
his
heart
for
his
instructor
the
boy
loved
the
man
intensely
in
a
few
days
and
immediately
began
studying
with
him
watching
him
copying
him
he
moved
with
swift
alertness
spoke
with
care
to
select
the
best
word
and
was
fast
becoming
punctiliously
polite
on
their
return
dovesky
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
lunching
with
the
minturns
the
things
of
which
he
and
the
boy
reminded
each
other
the
notes
they
reproduced
by
whistling
calling
or
a
combination
the
execution
of
these
on
the
violin
the
references
dovesky
made
to
certain
bird
songs
which
recalled
to
his
mind
passages
in
operas
in
secular
and
sacred
productions
his
rendition
of
the
wild
music
and
then
the
human
notes
his
comparison
of
the
two
and
his
remarks
on
different
composers
his
mastery
of
the
violin
and
his
ability
to
play
long
passages
preceding
and
following
the
parts
taken
from
the
birds
were
intensely
absorbing
and
educative
to
all
of
them
then
tower
would
add
the
description
and
history
of
each
bird
in
question
minturn
started
the
boys
library
with
interesting
works
on
ornithology
everything
that
had
been
written
concerning
strains
in
bird
and
human
music
the
lives
and
characters
of
the
musicians
in
whose
work
the
bird
passages
appeared
or
who
used
melodies
so
like
the
birds
it
made
the
fact
apparent
the
feathered
folk
had
inspired
them
this
led
to
minute
examination
of
the
lives
of
the
composers
in
an
effort
to
discover
which
of
them
were
country
born
and
had
worked
in
haunts
where
birds
might
be
heard
the
differing
branches
of
information
opened
up
seemed
endless
the
change
this
work
made
in
the
boys
appeared
to
james
minturn
and
his
sister
as
something
marvellous
that
the
work
was
also
making
a
change
in
the
heart
of
the
man
himself
was
an
equal
miracle
he
did
not
realize
as
each
day
new
avenues
opened
he
began
to
understand
dimly
how
much
it
would
have
meant
to
him
in
his
relations
with
his
wife
if
he
had
begun
long
ago
under
her
tuition
and
learned
at
least
enough
to
appreciate
the
one
thing
outside
society
which
she
found
absorbing
he
began
to
see
that
if
he
had
listened
and
tried
and
had
induced
her
to
repeat
to
him
parts
of
the
great
composers
she
so
loved
on
her
instruments
when
they
reached
home
he
soon
could
have
come
to
recognize
them
and
so
an
evening
at
the
opera
with
her
would
have
meant
pleasure
to
himself
instead
of
stolid
endurance
ultimately
it
might
have
meant
an
effective
wedge
with
which
to
pry
against
the
waste
of
time
strength
and
money
on
the
sheer
amusement
of
herself
in
society
once
he
started
searching
for
them
he
found
many
ways
in
which
he
might
have
made
his
life
with
his
wife
different
if
indeed
he
had
not
had
it
in
his
power
to
effect
a
complete
change
by
having
been
firm
in
the
beginning
of
this
one
thing
he
was
sure
to
certainty
that
if
he
had
been
able
to
introduce
any
such
element
of
interest
into
his
wife
residence
as
he
had
through
merely
saying
the
word
in
his
own
it
surely
would
have
made
some
of
the
big
difference
then
it
was
making
now
he
found
himself
brooding
yearning
over
his
sons
and
his
feeling
for
them
broadening
and
deepening
as
he
daily
saw
james
seeking
more
and
more
to
be
with
him
to
understand
what
he
was
doing
his
pride
in
being
able
to
feel
that
he
had
helped
if
it
were
no
more
than
to
sit
in
court
and
hand
a
marked
book
at
the
right
moment
he
began
to
make
a
comrade
of
and
to
develop
a
feeling
of
dependence
on
the
boy
he
watched
malcolm
with
his
quicker
intellect
his
daily
evidence
of
temperament
his
rapidly
developing
musical
ability
and
felt
the
tingle
of
pride
in
his
lithe
ruddy
beauty
so
like
his
mother
and
his
talent
so
like
hers
the
boy
under
the
interest
of
the
music
and
with
the
progress
he
was
making
in
doing
a
new
unusual
thing
soon
began
to
develop
her
mannerisms
when
he
was
most
polite
her
charm
was
apparent
when
he
was
offended
her
hauteur
enveloped
him
when
he
was
pleased
and
happy
her
delicate
tinge
of
rose
flushed
his
transparent
cheek
while
the
lights
on
his
hair
glinted
with
her
colour
he
shut
himself
in
his
room
and
worked
with
his
violin
until
time
to
start
to
the
tamarack
swamp
when
minturn
promptly
appeared
with
the
car
he
found
malcolm
had
borrowed
dovesky
khaki
suit
and
waders
for
him
and
on
the
advice
of
the
boy
he
wore
the
stiff
coarse
clothing
which
the
tamaracks
would
not
tear
the
mosquitoes
could
not
bite
through
and
muck
and
water
would
not
easily
penetrate
there
were
many
reasons
when
they
reached
the
swamp
both
of
them
put
on
boots
and
then
following
his
son
and
doing
exactly
what
he
was
told
james
minturn
forgot
law
politics
and
business
with
anxious
heart
he
prayed
that
the
bird
the
lad
wished
to
sing
would
evolve
its
sweetest
notes
and
that
his
high
hope
of
reproducing
the
music
perfectly
enough
to
induce
the
singer
to
answer
would
be
fulfilled
malcolm
advanced
softly
slipping
under
branches
around
bushes
over
deep
moss
beds
that
sank
in
an
ooze
of
water
at
the
pressure
of
a
step
and
sprung
back
on
release
imitating
every
caution
stepping
in
the
boy
tracks
and
keeping
a
few
rods
behind
followed
his
father
he
had
rolled
his
sleeves
to
the
elbow
left
his
shirt
open
at
the
throat
while
for
weeks
the
joy
of
wind
and
weather
on
his
bared
head
had
been
his
so
that
as
he
silently
followed
his
son
he
made
an
impressive
figure
at
a
certain
point
malcolm
stopped
motioning
his
father
to
come
to
him
now
this
is
as
far
as
i
gone
yet
he
whispered
you
stay
here
and
we
wait
till
the
music
begins
if
i
can
do
it
as
well
as
i
have
for
three
nights
and
get
an
answer
i
going
to
try
to
call
the
hermit
bird
i
sing
with
if
a
hen
answers
i
do
the
male
notes
and
try
to
coax
her
where
you
can
see
if
a
male
sings
i
do
his
song
once
or
twice
to
show
you
how
close
i
can
come
and
then
i
do
the
hen
call
note
and
see
if
i
can
coax
him
out
for
you
if
i
creep
ahead
you
keep
covered
as
much
as
you
can
and
follow
but
stay
as
far
as
that
big
tree
behind
me
and
do
for
your
life
move
or
make
a
noise
when
i
still
i
go
far
ahead
as
i
want
to
be
to
start
on
now
do
forget
to
be
quiet
and
listen
hard
i
wo
forget
said
james
minturn
oh
but
it
will
be
awful
if
one
does
sing
not
at
all
answered
minturn
this
is
a
new
experience
for
me
i
get
the
benefit
of
a
sight
of
the
swamp
that
will
pay
for
the
trip
if
i
do
even
see
a
bird
by
the
boy
sigh
of
relief
the
father
knew
he
had
quieted
his
anxiety
malcolm
went
softly
ahead
a
few
yards
and
stopped
sheltering
himself
in
a
clump
of
willow
and
button
bushes
his
father
made
himself
as
inconspicuous
as
he
could
and
waited
he
studied
the
trunks
of
the
big
scaly
trees
the
intermingled
branches
covered
with
tufts
of
tiny
spines
and
here
and
there
the
green
cones
nestling
upright
the
cool
water
rising
around
his
feet
called
his
attention
to
the
deep
moss
bed
silvery
green
in
the
evening
light
here
and
there
on
moss
mounds
at
the
tree
bases
he
could
see
the
broad
leaves
and
ripening
pods
that
he
thought
must
be
moccasins
seeding
then
his
eye
sought
the
crouching
boy
and
he
again
prayed
that
he
would
not
be
disappointed
with
his
prayer
came
the
answer
a
sweep
of
wings
overhead
a
brown
flash
through
the
tamaracks
and
then
a
burst
of
slow
sweet
notes
then
silence
james
minturn
leaned
forward
his
eyes
on
his
son
his
precious
little
lad
how
the
big
strong
man
hoped
until
it
became
the
very
essence
of
prayer
that
he
would
be
granted
the
pride
and
pleasure
the
triumph
of
success
for
his
ears
told
him
that
to
reproduce
the
notes
he
had
just
heard
would
undoubtedly
be
the
crowning
performance
of
bird
music
surely
there
could
be
no
other
songster
gifted
like
that
the
bird
made
a
short
flight
and
sang
again
across
the
swamp
came
a
repetition
of
his
notes
from
another
of
his
kind
so
the
brown
streak
moved
in
that
direction
at
its
next
pause
its
voice
arose
again
sweeter
for
the
mellowing
distance
and
then
another
bird
not
so
far
away
answered
the
bird
replied
and
came
winging
in
sight
this
time
peering
uttering
a
short
note
unlike
its
song
and
not
until
it
came
searching
where
he
could
see
it
distinctly
did
james
minturn
awake
to
the
realization
that
the
last
notes
had
been
malcolm
his
heart
swelled
big
with
prideful
possession
what
a
wonderful
accomplishment
what
a
fine
boy
how
careful
he
must
be
to
help
and
to
guide
him
again
the
bird
across
the
swamp
sang
and
the
one
in
sight
turned
in
that
direction
then
began
a
duet
that
was
a
marvellous
experience
the
far
bird
called
malcolm
answered
soon
they
heard
a
reply
minturn
saw
the
boy
beckoning
him
and
crept
to
his
side
it
a
female
whispered
malcolm
i
going
to
sing
the
male
notes
and
calls
and
try
to
toll
her
you
follow
but
do
get
too
close
and
scare
her
the
father
could
see
the
tense
poise
of
malcolm
stepping
lightly
avoiding
the
open
stooping
beneath
branches
hiding
in
bushes
making
his
way
onward
at
every
complete
ambush
sending
forth
those
wonderful
notes
at
each
repetition
it
seemed
to
the
father
that
the
song
grew
softer
more
pleading
of
fuller
intonation
and
then
his
heart
almost
stopped
for
he
began
to
realize
that
each
answer
to
the
boy
call
was
closer
than
the
one
before
malcolm
would
sleep
that
night
with
a
joyful
heart
he
was
tolling
the
bird
he
imitated
it
was
coming
at
his
call
of
that
there
could
be
no
question
his
last
notes
came
from
a
screen
of
spreading
button
bushes
and
northern
holly
at
the
usual
interval
they
heard
the
reply
but
recognizably
closer
malcolm
raised
his
hand
without
moving
or
looking
back
but
his
father
saw
and
interpreted
the
gesture
to
mean
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
stop
he
took
a
few
steps
to
conceal
himself
for
he
was
between
trees
when
the
signal
came
and
paused
already
so
elated
he
wanted
to
shout
he
scarcely
could
restrain
the
impulse
what
was
the
use
in
going
farther
his
desire
was
to
race
back
to
multiopolis
at
speed
limit
to
tell
dovesky
margaret
and
tower
what
a
triumph
he
had
witnessed
he
wanted
to
talk
about
it
to
his
men
friends
and
business
associates
distinctly
through
the
slowly
darkening
green
he
could
see
the
boy
putting
all
his
heart
into
the
song
james
minturn
watched
so
closely
he
was
not
mistaken
in
thinking
he
could
see
the
lad
figure
grow
tense
as
he
delivered
the
notes
and
relax
when
the
answer
relieved
his
anxiety
as
to
whether
it
would
come
again
and
then
gather
for
another
trial
at
the
last
call
the
reply
came
from
such
a
short
distance
that
minturn
began
intently
watching
from
his
shelter
to
witness
the
final
triumph
of
seeing
the
bird
malcolm
had
called
across
the
swamp
come
into
view
he
could
see
that
the
boy
was
growing
reckless
for
as
he
delivered
the
strain
he
stepped
almost
into
the
open
watching
before
him
and
slowly
going
ahead
with
the
answer
there
was
a
discernible
movement
a
few
yards
away
minturn
saw
the
boy
start
and
gazed
at
him
with
bent
body
malcolm
stared
before
him
and
then
his
father
heard
his
amazed
awed
cry
mother
is
that
mother
are
you
malcolm
came
the
incredulous
answer
james
minturn
was
stupefied
distinctly
he
could
see
now
he
did
not
recognize
the
knee
boots
the
outing
suit
of
coarse
green
material
but
the
beautiful
pink
face
slowly
paling
the
bright
waving
hair
framing
it
he
knew
very
well
astonishment
bound
him
malcolm
advanced
another
step
still
half
dazed
and
cried
why
have
i
been
calling
i
thought
it
was
the
bird
i
saw
still
answering
and
i
believed
you
were
the
hermit
singing
she
said
but
you
fooled
the
bird
said
the
boy
close
here
it
answered
you
and
near
me
it
called
you
said
minturn
your
notes
were
quite
as
perfect
malcolm
straightened
and
seemed
reassured
why
mother
he
exclaimed
when
did
you
study
music
have
you
just
come
back
i
been
away
only
two
weeks
malcolm
she
answered
and
if
it
had
been
for
learning
the
bird
notes
i
have
returned
sooner
but
where
have
you
cried
the
boy
at
home
i
reserved
my
suite
she
answered
but
home
all
torn
up
and
pounding
and
sick
people
and
you
hate
pounding
and
sick
people
he
reminded
her
there
was
so
very
much
noise
malcolm
she
said
and
i
changed
about
sickness
you
have
to
suffer
yourself
to
do
that
once
you
learn
how
dreadful
pain
is
you
feel
only
pity
for
those
who
endure
it
every
night
when
the
nurses
are
resting
i
change
so
no
one
knows
me
and
slip
into
the
rooms
of
the
suffering
little
children
who
ca
sleep
and
try
to
comfort
them
mother
who
takes
care
of
he
questioned
a
very
sensible
girl
named
susan
she
answered
the
boy
went
a
step
closer
mother
have
you
changed
about
anything
besides
sickness
he
asked
eagerly
yes
malcolm
said
his
mother
i
changed
about
every
single
thing
in
all
this
world
that
i
ever
said
or
did
or
loved
when
you
knew
me
you
have
he
cried
in
amazement
would
you
wear
that
dress
and
come
to
the
woods
with
us
now
and
do
some
of
the
things
we
like
i
rather
come
here
with
you
and
sing
these
bird
notes
than
anything
else
i
ever
did
she
answered
malcolm
advanced
another
long
stride
mother
is
susan
a
pounding
beating
person
like
lucette
he
asked
anxiously
no
she
said
softly
susan
likes
children
when
she
not
busy
for
me
she
goes
into
the
music
room
and
plays
games
and
sings
songs
to
little
sick
people
because
you
know
said
malcolm
james
and
i
talk
it
over
when
we
are
alone
we
never
let
father
hear
because
he
loved
elizabeth
so
and
so
fine
mother
you
were
about
father
not
being
a
gentleman
not
even
dovesky
is
a
finer
gentleman
than
father
and
father
loved
her
so
but
mother
james
and
i
we
believe
if
it
had
been
the
cream
it
would
have
made
us
sick
too
and
we
so
of
what
we
did
if
we
had
another
we
be
as
good
to
a
little
sister
as
father
is
to
us
mother
we
wish
we
had
her
back
so
we
could
try
nellie
minturn
shut
her
eyes
and
swayed
on
her
feet
but
presently
she
spoke
in
a
harsh
breathless
whisper
yet
it
carried
even
to
the
ears
of
the
listening
man
yes
malcolm
i
give
my
life
oh
so
gladly
if
i
could
bring
her
back
and
try
over
you
would
have
any
person
like
lucette
around
would
you
mother
he
questioned
not
ever
again
malcolm
she
answered
i
have
little
sister
back
if
it
were
possible
but
that
ca
ever
be
because
when
we
lose
people
as
elizabeth
went
they
never
can
come
back
but
i
offer
my
life
to
come
as
near
replacing
her
as
possible
and
everywhere
i
neglected
you
and
james
and
father
i
do
the
best
there
is
in
me
if
any
of
you
love
me
or
me
in
the
least
or
will
give
me
an
opportunity
to
try
mother
would
you
come
where
we
are
would
you
live
as
we
do
marvelled
the
boy
gladly
she
answered
it
about
the
only
way
i
could
live
now
given
away
so
much
of
the
money
then
i
ask
father
cried
the
boy
why
i
forgot
father
is
right
back
here
father
father
father
come
quick
father
it
was
the
hermit
bird
at
all
it
was
mother
and
oh
joy
father
joy
she
just
changed
and
changed
till
she
as
changed
as
we
are
come
back
father
and
she
go
to
the
woods
with
us
oh
she
will
father
you
are
you
when
nellie
minturn
saw
her
husband
coming
across
the
mosses
his
arms
outstretched
his
face
she
came
swiftly
forward
and
as
she
reached
malcolm
minturn
caught
both
of
them
in
his
arms
crying
my
sweetheart
my
beautiful
sweetheart
give
me
another
chance
and
this
time
i
be
the
head
of
my
family
in
deed
and
in
truth
and
i
make
life
go
right
for
all
of
us
chapter
xix
i
sorry
no
end
said
mickey
first
time
i
ever
been
late
i
was
helping
peter
we
were
so
busy
that
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
heard
the
hum
of
her
gliding
past
the
clover
field
so
i
was
left
i
know
how
hard
you
working
it
wo
happen
again
mickey
studied
his
friend
closely
he
decided
the
time
had
come
to
watch
douglas
bruce
was
pale
and
restless
he
spent
long
periods
in
frowning
thought
he
aroused
from
one
of
these
and
asked
what
were
you
and
peter
doing
that
was
so
very
absorbing
well
about
the
most
interesting
thing
that
ever
happened
said
mickey
you
see
peter
is
one
of
the
grandest
men
who
ever
lived
so
fine
and
doing
so
many
things
in
a
way
he
kind
of
fell
behind
in
the
ones
i
heard
of
men
doing
that
before
commented
douglas
ca
you
tell
me
a
new
one
sure
said
mickey
you
know
the
place
and
how
good
it
seems
on
the
outside
well
it
did
look
so
good
inside
in
the
part
that
counted
most
you
noticed
the
big
barns
sheds
and
outbuildings
all
the
modern
conveniences
for
a
man
from
an
electric
lantern
to
a
stump
puller
everything
i
telling
you
and
for
the
nice
lady
nix
her
work
table
faced
a
wall
covered
with
brown
oilcloth
and
frying
pans
heavy
enough
to
sprain
willard
a
wood
fire
to
boil
clothes
and
bake
bread
in
this
hot
weather
the
room
so
low
and
dark
no
ice
box
with
acres
of
ice
close
every
winter
no
water
inside
no
furnace
and
carrying
washtubs
to
the
kitchen
for
bathing
as
well
as
washing
aw
gee
you
get
the
picture
i
certainly
do
agreed
douglas
and
yet
she
was
a
neat
little
woman
sure
said
mickey
if
she
had
to
set
up
housekeeping
in
sunrise
alley
in
one
day
you
could
tell
her
place
from
anybody
else
sure
she
a
nice
lady
but
she
has
troubles
of
her
own
i
guess
everybody
has
yes
i
think
they
have
assented
douglas
i
could
muster
a
few
right
now
myself
yes
cried
mickey
that
bad
let
drop
this
and
cut
them
out
presently
said
douglas
my
head
is
so
tired
it
will
do
me
good
to
think
about
something
else
a
few
minutes
you
were
saying
harding
had
trouble
what
is
it
mickey
returned
to
his
subject
with
a
chuckle
she
was
ready
to
tackle
them
nervous
prostrations
so
popular
with
the
swell
dames
he
explained
because
every
morning
for
fifteen
years
she
faced
the
brown
oilcloth
and
pots
and
pans
while
been
wild
to
watch
sunup
from
under
a
particular
old
apple
tree
when
she
might
have
seen
it
every
morning
if
peter
had
been
on
his
job
enough
to
saw
a
window
in
the
right
place
get
that
yes
i
get
it
conceded
douglas
go
on
well
i
began
her
work
so
she
started
right
away
and
before
she
got
back
in
comes
peter
when
he
asks
where
she
was
and
why
she
went
i
was
afraid
but
for
her
sake
i
told
him
i
told
him
everything
i
had
noticed
at
first
he
did
like
it
it
a
wonder
he
did
break
your
neck
well
said
mickey
judicially
as
i
size
peter
up
he
fight
an
awful
fight
if
he
was
fighting
but
he
ai
much
on
a
fight
i
worked
the
separator
steady
and
by
and
by
when
i
up
the
argument
as
a
friend
of
mine
says
i
guess
that
cream
separator
did
look
any
bigger
to
peter
set
beside
a
full
house
and
two
or
three
sheds
for
the
stuff
he
brought
to
make
work
easier
than
it
did
to
me
i
wager
it
did
laughed
douglas
no
it
did
cried
mickey
earnestly
and
when
he
stood
over
it
awhile
that
big
iron
stove
made
his
kitchen
where
his
wife
lived
most
of
her
day
seem
as
hot
as
my
room
where
he
was
raving
over
lily
having
been
and
when
he
faced
the
brown
oilcloth
and
the
old
iron
skillets
for
a
few
minutes
of
silent
thought
he
bolted
at
about
two
peter
ai
so
slow
what
did
he
do
asked
douglas
why
we
planned
to
send
her
on
a
visit
said
mickey
and
cut
that
window
and
move
in
the
pump
and
invest
in
one
of
those
country
gas
plants
run
on
a
big
tank
of
gasoline
away
outside
where
it
all
safe
and
a
and
a
dishwasher
and
some
lighter
cooking
things
but
we
got
interned
how
mickey
interestedly
inquired
douglas
remember
i
told
you
about
junior
coming
in
to
hunt
work
because
he
was
tired
of
the
country
and
how
it
turned
out
said
mickey
yes
i
recall
perfectly
answered
douglas
there
a
good
one
on
me
about
that
i
have
told
you
yet
but
i
will
said
mickey
well
when
son
came
home
wrapped
in
a
comfort
there
was
a
ripping
up
on
the
part
of
peter
he
just
back
the
enemy
and
who
do
you
think
he
hit
the
hardest
i
have
an
idea
said
douglas
in
your
shoes
i
would
one
either
said
mickey
well
he
did
go
for
junior
or
his
ma
or
me
peter
stood
mister
peter
harding
out
before
us
and
then
did
leave
him
a
leg
to
stand
on
he
proved
conclusive
he
used
every
spare
moment
he
had
since
junior
was
in
short
clothes
carrying
him
to
multiopolis
to
amuse
him
and
feed
him
treats
and
show
him
shows
so
he
was
to
blame
if
junior
developed
a
big
consuming
appetite
for
such
things
how
does
the
argument
strike
you
sound
cried
douglas
perfectly
sound
it
precisely
what
the
land
owners
are
doing
every
day
of
their
lives
and
then
wailing
because
the
cities
take
their
children
i
had
that
studied
out
for
a
year
past
well
peter
figured
it
right
there
for
us
in
detail
said
mickey
then
he
tackled
ma
harding
and
her
sunup
and
then
he
thought
out
a
way
to
furnish
entertainment
and
all
the
modern
comforts
right
there
at
home
what
entertainment
said
douglas
well
he
specified
saddles
and
horses
to
ride
grinned
mickey
and
swimming
and
a
and
tackle
for
all
of
us
a
launch
on
whatever
lake
we
like
best
a
big
entertainment
house
with
a
floor
for
skating
and
dancing
and
a
stage
for
plays
we
will
get
up
ourselves
and
a
movie
machine
i
to
find
out
how
to
run
one
and
teach
them
and
then
he
rent
reels
and
open
it
twice
a
week
the
big
hole
that
will
cave
in
on
the
north
side
of
multiopolis
soon
now
will
be
caused
by
the
slump
when
our
neighbourhood
withdraws
its
patronage
and
begins
being
entertained
by
peter
and
you
see
that
it
will
work
too
of
course
it
will
agreed
douglas
once
the
country
folk
get
the
idea
it
will
go
like
a
landslide
so
that
what
made
you
late
well
connected
with
that
explained
mickey
peter
did
do
a
thing
but
figure
up
the
price
he
paid
for
every
he
ever
bought
for
himself
and
he
came
out
a
little
over
six
thousand
he
said
he
would
have
wanted
ma
in
a
hardware
store
selecting
his
implements
so
he
guessed
he
would
choose
hers
he
just
drew
a
check
for
what
he
said
was
her
due
with
interest
and
put
it
in
her
name
in
the
bank
and
told
her
to
cut
loose
and
spend
it
exactly
as
she
pleased
what
did
she
do
marvelled
douglas
well
she
was
tickled
silly
but
she
did
lose
her
head
she
began
investigating
what
had
been
put
on
the
market
to
meet
her
requirements
at
present
we
are
living
on
the
threshing
floor
mostly
and
the
whole
house
is
packed
up
when
it
is
unpacked
there
be
a
bathroom
on
the
second
floor
and
a
lavatory
on
the
first
there
be
a
furnace
in
one
room
of
the
basement
and
a
coal
bin
big
enough
for
a
winter
supply
we
can
hitch
on
to
the
trolley
line
for
electric
lights
all
over
the
house
and
barn
and
outbuildings
and
fireless
cooker
iron
and
vacuum
cleaner
and
a
whole
bunch
of
conveniences
for
ma
including
a
washing
machine
and
stationary
tubs
in
the
basement
gee
get
the
picture
i
surely
do
what
else
mickey
asked
douglas
you
know
i
a
house
to
furnish
soon
myself
well
a
new
kitchen
on
the
other
end
of
the
building
where
there
a
breeze
and
a
big
clover
field
and
a
wood
and
her
work
table
right
where
it
is
in
line
with
her
private
and
particular
sunup
there
a
big
sink
with
hot
and
cold
water
and
a
dishwasher
there
a
and
a
little
glass
churn
both
of
which
can
be
hitched
to
the
electricity
to
run
there
a
big
register
from
the
furnace
close
the
work
table
for
winter
and
a
gas
cook
stove
that
has
more
works
than
a
watch
what
does
the
lady
say
about
it
little
said
mickey
she
just
stands
and
wipes
the
shiny
places
with
her
apron
or
handkerchief
and
laughs
and
cries
so
it
ai
set
up
yet
but
you
can
see
just
standing
before
it
what
it
going
to
mean
for
her
and
there
a
chute
from
the
upstairs
to
the
basement
to
scoot
the
wash
down
to
the
electric
machine
to
rub
them
and
a
little
gas
stove
with
two
burners
to
boil
them
and
the
iron
i
told
you
of
hanging
it
up
is
the
hardest
part
of
the
wash
these
days
and
since
they
have
three
big
rooms
in
the
basement
peter
thought
this
morning
that
he
could
put
all
the
food
in
one
and
stretch
her
lines
in
the
winter
for
the
clothes
to
dry
in
the
washroom
the
furnace
will
heat
it
and
it
light
and
clean
we
are
going
to
paint
it
when
everything
is
in
place
is
that
all
queried
douglas
it
a
running
start
said
mickey
i
do
know
as
peter
will
ever
get
to
the
kitchen
is
going
to
have
white
woodwork
and
blue
walls
and
blue
linoleum
and
new
enamelled
cooking
things
from
start
to
finish
with
no
iron
in
the
bunch
except
two
skillets
saved
for
frying
even
the
dishpan
is
going
to
be
blue
and
she
crying
and
laughing
same
time
while
she
hems
wash
curtains
for
the
windows
all
the
house
is
going
to
have
hardwood
floors
the
rooms
cut
more
convenient
out
goes
the
old
hall
into
just
a
small
place
to
take
off
your
wraps
and
the
remainder
added
to
the
parlour
all
the
carpets
and
the
old
heavy
curtains
are
being
ground
up
and
woven
into
rugs
gee
it
an
insurrection
ma
harding
and
i
surely
started
things
when
we
planned
to
dose
junior
on
multiopolis
and
let
her
the
landscape
you
can
tell
by
her
face
she
seeing
it
if
she
sails
into
the
port
o
glory
looking
more
glorified
be
a
wonder
and
peter
you
ought
to
see
peter
and
junior
you
should
see
junior
planning
his
room
and
mickey
you
must
see
mickey
planning
his
and
mary
and
bobbie
and
above
all
you
should
see
lily
last
i
saw
of
her
peter
was
holding
her
under
her
arms
and
she
was
shoving
her
feet
before
her
trying
to
lift
them
up
a
little
we
most
rubbed
them
off
her
with
fine
sand
and
then
stuck
them
in
cold
water
and
then
sanded
them
again
and
they
not
the
same
feet
that
a
cinch
is
that
the
sum
of
the
harding
improvements
asked
douglas
drawing
fine
lines
on
a
sheet
of
figures
before
him
well
it
a
fair
showing
said
mickey
we
ai
got
the
new
rugs
and
the
music
box
and
the
books
or
the
old
furniture
rubbed
and
oiled
yet
when
the
house
is
finished
peter
expressly
specified
that
his
lady
was
to
get
her
clothes
so
she
could
go
to
the
club
house
and
not
be
picked
for
a
country
woman
by
what
she
mickey
this
is
so
interesting
it
has
given
my
head
quite
a
rest
maybe
now
i
can
see
my
way
clearly
but
one
thing
more
how
long
are
you
planning
to
stay
there
you
talk
as
if
there
said
mickey
did
you
hear
me
say
there
was
a
horse
and
saddle
and
a
room
for
me
and
a
room
for
lily
there
why
for
ever
and
ever
more
that
when
i
got
into
trouble
and
called
on
peter
to
throw
a
lifeline
he
did
it
up
browner
than
his
job
for
ma
a
was
all
i
asked
peter
established
a
regular
can
us
you
mean
peter
adopted
both
of
you
cried
douglas
sure
indorsed
mickey
with
a
flourish
you
see
it
was
like
this
when
we
dosed
junior
with
multiopolis
the
old
threshing
machine
took
a
hand
and
did
some
things
to
him
that
was
on
the
program
he
found
out
about
it
and
it
made
him
mad
when
he
got
his
dander
up
he
hit
back
by
turning
old
miss
country
loose
on
me
first
i
tried
a
ram
and
yellow
jackets
then
only
a
little
bunch
of
maple
twigs
was
all
the
pull
i
had
to
keep
me
from
going
to
the
bottomless
pit
by
the
way
of
the
nastiest
quicksand
on
atwater
lake
us
fellows
went
back
one
day
and
fed
it
logs
bigger
than
i
am
and
it
sucked
them
down
like
peter
does
a
plate
of
noodles
then
junior
thought
curling
a
big
dead
rattler
in
the
path
and
shunting
me
so
i
step
right
on
it
would
be
a
prime
joke
but
he
did
figure
on
the
snake
he
had
fixed
for
me
having
a
mate
as
big
and
ugly
as
it
was
that
would
follow
and
coil
zipping
mad
over
the
warm
twisting
body
mickey
gasped
douglas
just
so
exactly
what
i
thought
and
then
some
when
i
dragged
what
was
left
of
me
home
that
night
and
figured
out
where
i
been
if
the
big
maple
had
spread
its
branch
just
as
wide
as
it
did
or
if
the
snake
had
hit
my
leg
of
my
britches
when
i
took
my
bearings
and
saw
where
i
was
at
the
thing
that
really
hurt
me
worst
was
that
if
gone
either
down
or
up
i
had
done
anything
for
lily
but
give
her
a
worse
horror
than
she
had
of
being
by
them
orphings
home
people
when
i
should
have
made
her
i
took
peter
to
the
barn
and
told
him
just
how
it
was
i
felt
mighty
queer
i
so
sure
that
one
scratch
on
my
leg
that
looked
ugly
might
the
snake
striking
through
the
cloth
and
dosing
me
some
i
was
so
sick
and
swelled
up
it
turned
out
to
be
yellow
jackets
but
it
might
snakes
and
i
was
a
little
upset
as
man
to
man
i
asked
him
what
i
ought
to
do
for
my
i
took
any
more
would
have
thought
the
jolt
the
box
gave
me
would
have
been
enough
but
it
was
it
took
the
snake
and
the
quicksand
to
just
right
real
wake
me
up
first
i
was
some
sore
on
junior
but
pretty
quick
i
saw
how
funny
it
was
so
i
got
over
it
he
should
have
had
his
neck
broken
wope
wope
back
up
cautioned
mickey
nothing
of
the
kind
you
ai
figuring
on
the
starving
the
beating
being
knocked
senseless
robbed
of
all
his
clothes
and
landing
in
the
morgue
with
the
victims
gee
junior
had
reasons
for
his
grouch
douglas
bruce
suddenly
began
to
laugh
wildly
umhum
that
what
i
told
you
said
mickey
well
that
night
i
laid
the
case
before
peter
out
on
the
hay
wagon
in
the
barnyard
so
moon
white
you
could
have
read
the
the
cattle
grunting
satisfied
all
around
us
katydids
insisting
on
it
emphatic
crickets
chirping
and
the
old
rooster
calling
off
the
night
watches
same
as
he
did
for
that
first
peter
who
denied
his
lord
i
thought
about
that
as
i
sat
and
watched
the
big
fellow
slowly
whittling
the
rack
and
once
in
a
while
putting
in
a
question
and
when
i
told
him
all
there
was
to
tell
he
said
this
he
said
lily
was
and
i
had
a
perfect
to
her
but
the
law
butt
in
there
a
law
we
could
evade
that
step
in
and
take
her
any
day
he
said
too
that
if
she
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
sudden
first
question
a
surgeon
would
ask
was
who
were
her
parents
and
if
she
had
none
who
in
their
place
could
give
him
a
right
to
operate
he
said
while
she
was
and
it
was
my
and
the
law
and
the
surgeon
would
say
we
were
not
related
and
i
was
not
of
age
he
said
there
were
times
when
the
law
got
its
paddle
in
and
went
to
fooling
with
red
tape
it
let
a
sick
person
lay
and
die
while
it
decided
what
to
do
he
said
he
known
a
few
just
exactly
such
cases
so
to
keep
the
law
from
making
a
fool
of
itself
as
it
often
did
better
step
in
and
fix
things
to
suit
us
before
it
ever
got
a
showdown
what
did
he
do
asked
douglas
bruce
eagerly
well
after
we
talked
it
over
we
moved
up
to
the
back
porch
and
peter
explained
to
ma
who
is
the
boss
of
that
family
only
she
it
and
she
said
for
him
to
do
exactly
what
his
conscience
and
his
god
dictated
that
where
his
namesake
put
it
over
that
first
peter
our
peter
said
if
god
is
to
dictate
my
course
you
remember
what
he
said
about
suffering
the
little
children
to
come
to
him
and
we
are
commanded
to
be
like
him
so
there
no
way
to
it
but
that
it
means
them
to
come
to
he
said
ma
she
spoke
quick
and
said
we
got
them
peter
said
we
got
them
now
the
question
is
whether
we
them
or
send
them
to
an
orphings
home
the
nice
lady
she
said
faster
than
i
can
tell
you
harding
ashamed
of
you
there
no
question
of
that
kind
there
never
going
to
be
do
get
het
up
about
it
said
peter
knew
all
the
time
there
i
just
to
hear
you
say
so
plain
and
so
far
as
i
concerned
my
way
is
clear
as
noonday
sun
said
peter
you
go
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
adopt
them
and
adopt
them
said
ma
will
make
mary
just
as
good
a
sister
as
she
could
ever
have
said
she
and
then
she
reached
over
and
put
her
arms
right
around
me
and
she
said
if
you
think
i
going
to
keep
on
trying
to
run
this
house
without
mickey
you
mistaken
i
began
to
cry
i
had
had
a
big
day
and
i
was
shaking
on
my
feet
anyway
then
peter
said
you
figured
it
out
to
the
end
is
it
to
be
they
are
of
age
or
forever
she
just
gripped
tighter
and
said
fast
as
words
can
come
say
make
it
forever
and
share
and
share
alike
willing
if
you
are
peter
he
said
willing
they
pay
their
way
any
place
forever
and
share
and
share
alike
is
my
idea
do
you
agree
mickey
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
and
peter
told
me
it
was
making
me
and
lily
both
his
just
as
far
as
the
law
could
do
it
we
could
go
all
the
farther
we
wanted
to
ourselves
he
said
it
meant
him
getting
the
same
for
me
and
lily
as
he
did
for
his
own
and
leaving
us
the
same
when
he
died
i
told
him
he
do
if
he
just
keep
off
the
old
orphings
home
devil
that
had
me
scared
stiff
all
my
days
i
tend
to
so
now
me
and
lily
belong
to
peter
our
mickey
why
did
you
tell
me
asked
douglas
why
did
you
want
me
to
adopt
you
well
so
far
as
is
concerned
said
mickey
i
ai
about
it
with
anybody
but
that
the
you
men
have
made
a
boy
must
obey
it
even
if
he
rather
be
skinned
alive
and
when
he
it
ai
or
that
the
law
i
was
up
against
it
and
i
did
know
but
i
have
the
snake
and
peter
was
on
hand
and
made
that
offer
and
he
was
grand
and
big
about
it
i
do
love
him
any
more
than
i
do
you
but
i
just
this
minute
discovered
that
it
in
my
skin
to
love
any
man
more
than
i
do
peter
so
you
have
to
get
used
to
the
fact
that
i
love
him
just
as
well
and
say
bruce
peter
is
the
finest
man
you
ever
knew
if
you
come
out
and
get
acquainted
you
just
be
tickled
to
have
him
in
the
golf
club
and
to
come
to
his
house
and
to
have
him
at
yours
his
nice
lady
is
exactly
like
miss
winton
only
older
say
she
and
peter
will
adopt
you
too
if
you
say
so
and
between
us
just
as
man
to
man
peter
is
a
regular
lifesaver
if
you
got
a
chance
you
better
catch
on
no
telling
what
you
might
want
of
him
mickey
you
do
say
the
most
poignant
things
cried
douglas
i
give
all
i
worth
to
catch
on
to
peter
right
now
and
cling
for
much
than
life
but
what
i
started
i
must
finish
and
peter
is
here
well
what
the
matter
with
me
asked
mickey
have
you
run
into
the
yellow
jackets
too
if
you
have
i
ahead
of
you
so
i
know
what
to
do
just
catch
on
to
me
think
you
are
big
enough
to
serve
as
a
straw
for
a
drowning
man
mickey
inquired
douglas
sure
i
big
enough
to
establish
a
over
you
this
minute
the
weight
of
my
body
has
anything
to
do
with
the
size
of
my
heart
or
how
fast
i
can
work
my
brains
and
feet
if
i
must
mickey
said
douglas
despairingly
it
my
candid
opinion
that
no
one
can
save
me
right
now
mickey
opened
his
lips
and
showed
that
his
brain
working
by
shutting
them
abruptly
on
something
that
seemed
very
much
as
if
it
had
started
to
be
sure
is
that
so
he
substituted
yes
i
in
the
sweat
box
admitted
douglas
and
it
uncomfortable
and
weakening
what
the
first
thing
we
must
do
to
get
you
out
what
i
facing
now
is
the
prospect
that
there
no
way
for
me
to
get
out
or
for
my
friends
to
get
me
out
admitted
douglas
i
wish
i
been
plowing
corn
the
boy
eyes
were
gleaming
he
was
stepping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
as
if
the
floor
burned
him
gosh
we
must
saw
wood
he
cried
you
go
on
and
tell
me
i
been
up
against
a
lot
of
things
maybe
i
can
think
up
something
honest
maybe
i
can
no
mickey
there
nothing
you
or
any
one
can
do
a
miracle
is
required
now
and
miracles
have
ceased
oh
i
do
know
exclaimed
mickey
look
how
they
been
happening
to
me
and
lily
right
along
i
ca
see
why
one
might
be
performed
for
you
just
as
well
i
wish
you
would
waste
so
much
time
i
wish
you
had
spent
an
hour
fooling
with
what
i
was
telling
you
would
keep
i
wish
you
give
me
a
job
and
let
me
get
busy
douglas
bruce
smiled
forlornly
i
gladly
give
you
the
job
of
saving
me
my
dear
friend
he
said
but
the
fact
is
i
have
a
notion
of
how
to
go
to
work
to
achieve
salvation
is
somebody
else
getting
ahead
of
you
not
that
i
know
of
no
i
do
think
so
that
is
the
trouble
said
douglas
i
do
wish
you
just
plain
tell
me
said
mickey
now
that
i
got
the
all
safe
over
lily
i
do
anything
for
you
maybe
i
could
think
up
some
scheme
i
an
awful
schemer
i
wish
you
me
you
need
think
i
come
on
now
suddenly
douglas
bruce
long
arms
stretched
across
the
table
before
him
his
head
fell
on
them
and
shuddering
sobs
shook
him
dance
steps
became
six
inches
high
while
in
desperation
he
began
polishing
the
table
with
his
cap
then
he
reached
a
wiry
hand
and
commenced
rubbing
douglas
up
and
down
the
spine
the
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
but
his
voice
was
even
and
clear
aw
come
on
now
he
begged
cut
that
out
that
wo
help
none
what
shall
i
shall
i
call
minturn
shall
i
get
miss
leslie
on
the
wire
bruce
arose
and
began
walking
the
floor
yes
he
said
yes
of
morning
call
her
mickey
ran
to
the
telephone
in
a
minute
here
she
is
he
announced
shall
i
go
no
stay
right
where
you
are
hello
leslie
are
you
all
right
i
sorry
to
say
i
am
not
i
up
against
a
proposition
i
do
know
how
to
handle
why
just
this
remember
your
father
told
me
in
your
presence
that
if
in
the
course
of
my
investigations
i
reached
his
office
i
was
to
wait
until
he
got
back
yes
i
thought
you
remember
you
know
the
order
of
the
court
gave
me
access
to
the
records
but
the
officials
whose
books
i
have
gone
over
have
been
pleased
about
it
although
reflection
would
have
told
them
if
it
had
been
i
it
would
have
been
some
other
man
but
the
point
is
this
i
almost
at
the
finish
and
i
have
found
what
obviously
exists
somewhere
i
now
up
to
the
last
office
which
is
your
father
the
shortage
either
has
to
be
there
or
in
other
departments
outside
those
i
was
delegated
to
search
so
that
further
pursuit
will
be
necessary
two
or
three
times
officials
have
suggested
to
me
that
i
go
over
your
father
records
first
as
an
evidence
that
there
was
no
favouritism
now
i
have
reached
them
and
this
proposition
if
i
go
ahead
in
his
as
i
have
in
other
offices
i
disobey
his
express
order
if
i
do
not
the
gang
will
set
up
a
howl
in
morning
paper
and
they
will
start
an
investigation
of
their
own
did
you
get
anything
from
him
this
morning
leslie
not
for
four
days
and
he
a
week
past
the
time
he
thought
he
would
be
back
i
see
leslie
what
shall
i
do
in
my
morning
mail
there
is
a
letter
from
the
men
whose
records
i
have
been
over
giving
me
this
ultimatum
on
winton
office
immediately
or
we
will
tell
them
to
go
ahead
but
leslie
yes
i
know
but
leslie
yes
you
are
ordering
me
to
tell
them
that
i
propose
to
conduct
the
search
in
his
department
as
i
did
theirs
and
if
they
will
not
await
his
return
from
this
business
trip
they
are
perfectly
free
to
go
ahead
you
are
that
is
the
thing
you
want
said
but
leslie
yes
i
know
but
leslie
it
is
him
and
it
barely
possible
there
might
be
a
traitor
there
better
men
than
he
have
been
betrayed
by
their
employees
i
admit
i
all
in
i
wish
you
would
come
and
bring
your
last
letter
from
him
we
see
if
we
ca
locate
him
by
wire
it
an
ugly
situation
of
course
i
did
think
it
would
come
to
this
yes
i
wish
you
would
if
you
say
so
i
will
but
all
right
then
come
at
once
douglas
turned
to
his
desk
wrote
a
few
hasty
lines
and
said
to
mickey
deliver
that
to
muller
at
the
city
hall
mickey
took
the
envelope
and
went
racing
in
half
the
time
he
would
have
used
in
going
to
the
city
hall
he
was
in
the
building
making
straight
for
the
office
of
the
editor
chaffner
was
standing
with
a
group
of
men
earnestly
discussing
some
matter
when
his
eye
was
attracted
by
mickey
directly
in
range
and
with
the
tip
of
his
index
finger
he
was
cutting
in
air
letters
plainly
to
be
followed
chaffner
nodded
slightly
and
continued
his
talk
a
second
later
he
excused
himself
and
mickey
followed
to
the
private
room
well
he
shot
at
the
boy

sunk
our

cotton
humph

chaffner

explained
and

would

that
he
said
but

against

dripping
tears

voice
controlled
and
steady

mickey

old
daddy
could
ever
have
done
it
and
if
somebody
under
him
has
gone
wrong
maybe
he

make
it
up
if

an
hour
or
so
that
day
miss
leslie
said
he
should
give

of
hers

be
willing
for
the
money
to
go
for
her
old
daddy
course
she
be
glad
to
use
it
for
her
daddy
and
she
got
a
lot
from
her
mother
and
maybe
daddy
has
sold
the
land
he
went
to
sell
and
all
of
that
ought
to
be
enough

he
and
miss

i
thought
minturn
ought
to
know
so
i
slipped
in
and
told
him
what
is
the
trouble
lad
asked
minturn
why
you
see
miss
leslie
old
daddy
is
one
of
the
city
officials
and
of
course
bruce
left
him
last
because
he
would
his
life
he
find
the
man
he
was
hunting
before
he
got
to
his
office
and
he
what
james
said
the
lady
turning
hurriedly
tell
her
about
it
mickey
said
minturn
calmly
well
there
ai
much
to
tell
said
mickey
my
boss
he
just
kept
stacking
up
figures
two
or
three
times
he
thought
he
had
his
man
and
then
he
strike
a
balance
and
the
men
whose
records
he
searched
kept
getting
madder
and
winton
went
west
to
sell
some
land
someway
he
been
gone
a
week
longer
than
he
expected
and
my
boss
is
all
through
except
him
and
now
the
other
men
say
if
he
does
begin
on
winton
books
right
away
will
and
he
told
my
boss
to
he
got
a
while
ago
i
was
in
the
office
talking
to
chaffner
whose
papers
i
sold
since
i
started
and
i
was
telling
him
what
nice
friends
i
had
and
how
bruce
and
miss
leslie
were
engaged
and
he
like
to
ate
me
up
when
i
could
see
why
he
told
me
about
investigations
he
had
his
men
like
i
going
to
be
make
and
sometimes
they
get
a
on
the
men
appointed
to
do
the
job
and
he
told
me
he
had
a
on
this
and
if
i
saw
trouble
coming
toward
my
boss
i
was
to
tell
him
and
maybe
he
did
say
sure
but
do
something
oh
james
cried
minturn
wait
dear
go
on
mickey
said
minturn
well
said
mickey
the
elevated
jumped
the
track
this
morning
when
my
boss
got
a
letter
saying
if
he
did
go
on
at
once
with
winton
office
somebody
else
would
and
the
people
who
have
been
in
the
air
ever
since
are
due
to
land
at
noon
and
it
pretty
quick
now
and
they
are
too
nice
for
any
use
did
you
ever
know
finer
people
no
i
never
did
said
minturn
but
james
i
do
understand
tell
me
quickly
and
plainly
chaffner
just
gave
me
the
figures
he
said
holding
over
a
slip
of
paper
if
that
amount
is
to
winton
credit
on
his
account
with
the
city
at
the
universal
bank
before
noon
nothing
at
all
if
disgrace
for
them
and
i
started
it
by
putting
bruce
on
the
case
i
raise
as
much
as
i
can
but
i
ca
secure
enough
by
that
time
without
men
knowing
it
winton
has
undoubtedly
gone
to
try
to
secure
what
he
needs
but
he
going
to
be
too
late
there
never
has
been
a
worse
time
to
raise
money
in
the
history
of
this
country
but
if
is
the
trouble
said
minturn
you
said
you
never
would
touch
what
i
put
in
your
name
for
yourself
why
not
use
it
for
him
if
that
is
enough
i
will
gladly
furnish
the
remainder
that
i
not
a
stranded
forsaken
woman
is
due
to
leslie
winton
all
i
have
would
be
big
enough
price
to
pay
for
you
and
my
boys
and
my
precious
home
be
quick
james
minturn
was
calling
the
universal
bank
mickey
and
minturn
waited
anxiously
they
involuntarily
drew
together
and
the
woman
held
the
boy
in
a
close
grip
while
her
face
alternately
paled
and
flushed
and
both
of
them
were
breathing
short
i
want
the
cashier
minturn
was
saying
do
his
voice
just
make
you
feel
like
you
were
on
the
rock
of
ages
whispered
mickey
minturn
smiling
nodded
hello
freeland
this
is
minturn
talking
james
minturn
you
will
remember
some
securities
i
deposited
with
you
not
long
ago
i
wish
to
use
a
part
of
them
to
pay
a
debt
i
owe
winton
kindly
credit
his
account
with
oh
he
there
in
the
bank
well
never
mind
then
i
did
know
he
was
back
yet
let
it
go
i
see
him
in
person
and
you
might
tell
him
that
his
daughter
is
at
my
office
yes
thank
you
no
you
need
say
anything
about
that
to
him
we
arrange
it
ourselves
now
where
am
i
at
demanded
mickey
i
do
think
you
know
mickey
said
minturn
and
i
am
sure
i
do
but
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
winton
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
if
his
mission
has
been
successful
his
face
will
tell
it
and
if
he
in
trouble
that
will
show
and
then
we
will
know
what
to
do
bruce
would
like
to
know
he
is
here
and
at
the
bank
i
think
i
go
tell
him
right
away
said
mickey
douglas
was
walking
the
floor
as
mickey
entered
you
delivered
the
letter
he
cried
mickey
shook
his
head
producing
the
envelope
you
did
shouted
bruce
you
did
thank
god
oh
thank
god
you
protested
mickey
why
did
you
demanded
douglas
well
you
see
said
mickey
me
and
chaffner
of
the
were
talking
a
while
ago
about
some
poetry
i
going
to
write
for
his
first
page
soon
now
i
always
sold
his
papers
you
know
so
i
sort
of
belong
and
i
happened
to
tell
him
i
was
working
for
you
and
how
fine
you
were
and
about
your
being
engaged
to
miss
leslie
and
he
seemed
to
kind
of
think
you
was
heading
for
trouble
he
just
plain
i
was
so
scared
i
begged
him
not
to
let
happen
i
told
him
how
everything
was
and
finally
i
got
him
to
promise
that
if
you
get
into
trouble
he
help
you
at
least
he
promised
you
see
been
a
newspaper
man
so
long
he
eats
it
and
sleeps
it
and
he
had
a
had
a
scoop
repeated
douglas
yes
a
great
one
biggest
one
in
ten
years
said
the
boy
he
loved
it
so
that
me
trying
to
pry
him
loose
from
it
was
about
like
working
to
move
the
iriquois
building
with
a
handspike
all
he
promise
that
first
trip
was
that
if
i
come
and
tell
him
when
i
saw
you
got
into
trouble
he
what
he
could
do
wanted
to
pump
you
for
material
for
his
scoop
i
suppose
commented
douglas
wope
wope
back
up
warned
mickey
he
did
pump
me
a
little
bit
and
he
did
to
he
told
me
nearly
three
weeks
ago
just
what
happen
about
now
as
he
had
things
doped
out
and
they
have
i
did
that
letter
should
be
delivered
this
morning
you
had
no
business
in
old
daddy
office
if
he
said
out
in
came
mickey
best
flourish
he
might
ready
he
exclaimed
he
had
his
friend
to
help
you
remember
i
heard
miss
leslie
tell
you
he
did
and
she
told
him
to
she
told
you
he
could
have
what
she
had
you
remember
of
course
he
might
to
use
some
of
his
office
money
real
quick
to
save
a
friend
that
he
to
save
if
it
took
all
he
had
and
all
miss
leslie
had
and
was
right
i
asked
you
the
other
day
if
a
man
might
use
the
money
he
handled
and
you
said
yes
he
was
to
if
he
had
his
books
straight
and
the
money
in
the
bank
when
his
time
for
accounting
came
time
to
account
yet
but
you
was
doing
this
investigating
among
his
bunch
and
so
i
guess
if
he
did
use
the
money
for
his
friend
he
had
to
go
on
that
trip
he
was
too
busy
to
take
miss
leslie
and
sell
something
or
do
something
to
get
ready
for
you
all
right
ai
it
yes
if
he
could
it
conceded
douglas
well
he
can
triumphed
mickey
he
can
just
as
easy
he
down
at
the
universal
bank
doing
it
right
now
what
cried
douglas

your
letter
over
and
tell
them
anxious
irritated
gents
that
you
investigate
the
basement
and
cupola
are
finished
just
as
soon
as
you
make
out
the
reports
you
are
figuring
up
that
will
give
you
time
to
act
independent
and
it
will
give
daddy
time
to
be
ready
for
you
mickey
what
if
he
did
get
the
land
sold
wavered
douglas
what
if
his
trip
was
a
failure
well
that

mickey
stepping
from

toe
to
the
other
do
ruffle
your
down
about

bad
luck
and

he
called
the
bank
to
tell
them
when
he
got
the
cashier
he
found
that
old
daddy
was
there
that
minute
there
cried
douglas
repeated
mickey
so
minturn
backed
water
and
he
told
the
cashier
he
need
mention
to
winton
that
he
was
going
to
turn
over
some
securities
he
had
there
to
pay
a
debt
he
owed
him
now
that
he
was
home
they
could
fix
it
up
between
themselves
but
he
told
the
cashier
to
tell
winton
that
miss
leslie
was
in
his
office
he
said
would
come
to
her
the
minute
he
could
and
then
if
he
was
happy
and
all
right
it
meant
that
he
had
sold
his
land
and
made
good
and
if
he
was
broke
up
we
would
know
what
to
do
about
putting
the
money
to
his
credit
the
nice
lady
said
to
put
a
lot
more
than
he
needed
so
if
they
did
investigate
they
could
see
he
had
plenty
see
minturn
said
we
could
tell
the
minute
we
saw
him
well
young
man
can
you
inquired
a
voice
behind
them
with
the
same
impulse
douglas
and
mickey
turned
to
winton
and
leslie
standing
far
enough
inside
the
door
to
have
heard
all
that
had
been
said
a
slow
red
crept
over
mickey
fair
face
douglas
sprang
to
his
feet
his
hand
outstretched
words
of
welcome
on
his
lips
winton
put
him
aside
with
a
gesture
i
asked
this
youngster
a
question
he
said
and
i
deeply
interested
in
the
answer
you
mickey
stepped
forward
taking
one
long
straight
look
into
the
face
of
the
man
before
him
then
his
exultant
laugh
trilled
as
the
notes
of
peter
old
bobolink
bird
on
the
meadow
fence
surest
thing
you
know
he
cried
in
ringing
joy
you
tired
you
need
washing
sleep
and
a
long
rest
but
there
is
any
glisteny
green
look
on
your
face
it
been
with
you
like
i
told
chaffner
it
in
the
bible
only
with
you
it
been
even
more
than
a
man
down
his
life
for
his
friend
it
was
a
near
squeak
but
you
made
it
gee
you
made
it
i
should
say
i
tell
winton
caught
mickey
lifting
him
from
his
feet
god
made
a
jewel
after
my
heart
when
he
made
you
lad
he
said
if
you
have
got
a
father
i
a
candidate
for
the
place
gee
you
the
nicest
man
said
mickey
if
i
was
out
with
a
telescope
searching
for
a
father
i
make
a
home
run
for
you
but
you
see
i
fairly
well
fixed
here
my
boss
too
fine
to
talk
about
that
i
work
for
to
earn
money
to
keep
me
and
my
family
there
peter
better
than
gold
who
annexed
both
me
and
my
child
there
chaffner
punching
me
up
every
time
i
see
him
about
my
job
for
him
soon
as
i
finish
school
i
you
for
a
father
only
i
crazy
about
peter
just
you
come
and
see
and
you
understand
i
be
there
soon
said
winton
i
have
reasons
for
wanting
to
know
him
thoroughly
and
by
the
way
how
do
you
do
douglas
how
is
the
great
investigation
coming
on
i
glad
to
hear
it
push
it
with
all
your
might
and
finish
up
so
we
can
have
a
month
on
atwater
without
coming
back
and
forth
i
feel
as
if
i
need
about
that
much
swimming
to
make
me
clean
as
the
young
man
here
suggests
travelling
over
the
west
in
midsummer
is
neither
cool
nor
cleanly
but
it
great
when
things
sell
as
ours
did
land
seems
to
be
moving
and
money
under
the
surface
nobody
has
lost
so
much
they
are
only
economizing
we
must
do
that
ourselves
but
swain
and
i
are
both
safe
so
we
shall
enjoy
a
few
years
of
work
to
recoup
some
pretty
heavy
losses
we
not
worth
what
we
were
but
we
are
even
with
a
home
base
the
love
of
god
big
in
our
hearts
and
doubly
all
right
since
if
we
could
have
righted
ourselves
our
friends
would
have
saved
us
thanks
to
this
little
live
wire
on
my
left
oh
daddy
if
you
searched
forever
you
could
have
found
a
better
name
for
mickey
cried
leslie
come
on
douglas
let
go
home
and
rest
just
as
soon
as
i
write
and
start
mickey
with
a
note
said
douglas
go
ahead
i
be
down
soon
he
turned
to
his
desk
wrote
a
few
lines
and
sealing
them
handed
the
envelope
to
the
waiting
boy
city
hall
he
said
and
mickey
i
see
the
whole
thing
it
will
take
some
time
to
figure
just
what
i
do
owe
you
broke
in
mickey
backing
away
mickey
we
drive
you
to
take
the
note
and
then
you
come
with
us
said
douglas
thanks
but
it
would
try
my
nerve
said
mickey
and
i
must
help
peter
move
in
the
pump
chapter
xx
that
night
mickey
voice
shrill
in
exuberant
rejoicing
preceded
him
down
the
highway
so
the
hardings
all
busy
working
out
their
new
plans
for
comfort
understood
that
something
unusually
joyous
had
happened
peaches
sat
straighter
in
her
big
chair
leaned
forward
and
smilingly
waited
ai
he
happy
soundin
she
said
to
harding
who
sat
near
her
sewing
i
guess
he
has
thought
out
the
best
piece
yet
mebby
this
time
it
will
be
good
enough
for
the
first
page
of
the
young
as
he
is
that
not
likely
said
the
literal
woman
no
manner
of
doubt
in
my
mind
but
that
he
do
great
newspaper
work
when
he
finishes
his
education
and
makes
his
start
but
i
think
bruce
will
use
all
his
influence
to
turn
him
toward
law
douglas
bruce
is
a
swell
said
peaches
and
me
and
mickey
just
loves
him
for
his
niceness
to
us
but
we
got
all
settled
mickey
is
going
to
write
the
piece
for
the
first
page
of
the
that
our
paper
and
then
we
are
going
to
make
all
my
pieces
into
a
book
like
i
got
it
started
here
peaches
picked
up
a
small
notebook
scrupulously
kept
and
lovingly
glanced
over
the
pages
on
each
of
which
she
had
induced
mickey
to
write
in
his
plainest
script
one
section
of
her
nightly
doggerel
and
if
he
failed
from
the
intense
affairs
of
the
day
she
left
a
blank
page
for
him
to
fill
later
taken
together
the
remainder
of
her
possessions
were
as
nothing
to
peaches
compared
with
that
book
not
an
hour
of
the
day
passed
that
it
was
not
in
her
fingers
every
line
of
it
she
knew
by
heart
and
she
learned
more
from
it
than
all
mickey
other
educational
efforts
peter
scraped
a
piece
of
fine
black
walnut
furniture
free
from
the
accumulated
varnish
of
years
and
ran
an
approving
hand
over
the
smooth
dark
surface
seasoned
with
long
use
he
smiled
at
her
she
smiled
back
falling
into
a
little
chant
that
had
been
on
her
lips
much
of
the
time
of
late
you
know
peter
you
know
peter
we
know
somepin
we
wo
tell
peter
nodded
beaming
on
her
just
listen
to
that
boy
peter
he
must
be
perfectly
possessed
said
nancy
he
did
ever
sound
so
glad
before
cried
the
child
eagerly
mickey
came
up
the
walk
radiant
he
divided
a
smile
between
harding
and
peter
and
bowed
low
before
peaches
as
he
laid
a
package
at
her
feet
then
he
struck
an
attitude
of
exaggerated
obeisance
and
recited
like
this
i
tickled
silly
when
i
see
my
august
lily
no
other
fellow
dude
or
gawk
owns
a
flower
that
can
laugh
and
peaches
immediately
laughed
so
did
all
of
them
peter
asked
mickey
were
you
ever
so
glad
that
you
thought
you
would
bust
wide
open
i
was
said
peter
i
am
this
minute
would
you
mind
specifying
circumstances
not
a
bit
said
peter
first
time
was
when
ma
said
she
marry
me
and
i
got
my
betrothal
kiss
second
was
the
day
she
said
she
forgive
my
years
of
selfish
dunderheadedness
and
start
over
now
you
mickey
what
yours
the
great
investigation
is
over
so
far
as
our
commission
goes
answered
mickey
multiopolis
is
robbed
where
she
was
sure
she
was
her
accounts
balance
in
the
departments
we
gone
over
nobody
gets
the
slick
face
the
glass
eye
the
lawn
mower
on
his
cocoanut
or
dons
the
candy
suit
from
our
work
but
some
folks
i
love
had
a
near
squeak
and
i
got
a
month
vacation
think
of
that
miss
lily
peaches
gee
let
get
things
fixed
up
here
and
have
a
party
to
show
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
what
coming
to
them
before
the
weather
gets
so
cold
they
wo
have
time
to
finish
their
jobs
this
fall
some
of
them
will
squirm
but
we
do
care
some
of
them
will
think
they
wo
do
it
but
they
kiss
me
lily
hug
me
tight
and
let
me
go
dig
on
the
furnace
foundation
i
sweat
this
out
of
me
when
the
children
were
sleeping
that
night
he
sat
on
the
veranda
and
told
harding
and
peter
exactly
what
he
thought
wise
to
repeat
of
the
day
experience
and
no
more
so
that
when
he
finished
all
they
knew
was
that
the
investigation
was
over
so
far
as
bruce
was
concerned
mickey
had
a
vacation
and
was
a
happy
boy
as
she
came
to
dinner
the
next
day
mary
laid
a
bundle
of
mail
beside
her
father
plate
when
he
saw
it
peter
as
was
his
custom
reached
for
the
to
read
the
war
headlines
he
opened
the
paper
gave
it
a
shake
stared
at
it
in
amazement
scanned
a
few
lines
and
muttered
well
for
the
lord
sake
then
he
glanced
over
the
sheets
at
mickey
and
back
again
the
family
arose
and
hurried
to
a
point
of
vantage
at
peter
shoulder
while
he
spread
the
paper
wide
and
held
it
high
so
that
all
of
them
could
see
enclosed
in
a
small
ruled
space
they
read
to
the
memory
of
the
biggest
scoop
that
ever
fell
in
mister
chaffner
soup
and
was
pitched
by
this
nicest
where
it
belonged
in
the
garbage
can
to
please
his
friend
michael
whoop
fellers
whoop
for
the
drownded
scoop
that
departed
this
life
in
our
editor
soup
all
together
boys
scoop
soup
whoop
they
rushed
at
mickey
shook
hands
thumped
patted
and
praised
him
when
a
wail
arose
to
the
point
of
reaching
his
consciousness
mickey
what
cried
peaches
let
me
take
it
just
a
minute
peter
said
mickey
wait
a
second
suggested
harding
picking
up
a
big
roll
that
they
had
knocked
to
the
floor
this
does
look
like
catalogues
and
it
addressed
to
you
likely
they
sent
you
some
of
your
own
now
maybe
chaffner
did
said
mickey
almost
at
the
bursting
point
course
he
is
awful
busy
the
busiest
man
in
the
world
i
expect
but
he
have
sent
me
a
copy
of
my
poetry
since
he
used
it
with
shaking
fingers
he
opened
the
roll
and
there
were
several
copies
of
the
similar
to
the
one
peter
held
and
on
the
top
of
one
was
scrawled
in
pencil
your
place
your
desk
and
your
salary
are
ready
whenever
you
want
to
begin
work
you
ca
come
too
soon
to
suit
chaffner
mickey
read
it
aloud
gee
he
said
i
wish
i
had
education
enough
to
begin
right
now
i
it
i
could
just
go
about
that
job
yes
honey
yes
i
coming
he
caught
up
another
paper
and
hurried
across
the
room
quietly
but
decidedly
closing
the
door
behind
him
so
when
mary
started
to
follow
junior
interposed
better
not
molly
he
said
mickey
wants
to
be
alone
with
his
family
for
a
few
minutes
say
father
ai
there
a
good
many
newspaper
men
worked
all
their
lives
and
got
no
such
show
as
that
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
said
peter
mickey
must
have
written
that
and
sent
it
in
before
he
came
home
yesterday
said
harding
i
call
it
pretty
bright
i
bet
if
the
truth
was
told
something
went
wrong
and
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
shutting
it
up
do
you
call
that
pretty
bright
pa
i
guess
i
no
fair
judge
said
peter
i
that
prejudiced
in
his
favour
that
when
he
said
the
cat
negotiate
the
rat
out
in
the
barn
i
thought
it
was
smart
yes
and
it
was
commented
junior
it
been
funny
for
everybody
to
all
sorts
of
things
ever
since
that
north
pole
business
so
it
was
funny
for
the
cat
too
father
do
you
think
that
note
really
means
that
chaffner
would
give
mickey
a
place
on
his
paper
and
pay
him
right
now
i
do
know
why
chaffner
would
write
it
out
and
sign
his
name
to
it
if
he
mean
it
said
peter
you
know
he
is
full
of
stuff
like
that
said
junior
he
could
do
some
every
day
about
people
other
than
peaches
if
he
wanted
to
father
ai
you
glad
he
in
our
family
are
you
going
to
tell
him
to
take
that
job
if
he
asks
you
no
i
ai
said
peter
he
too
young
and
not
the
book
learning
to
do
himself
justice
while
that
place
is
too
grown
up
and
exciting
for
a
boy
of
his
nerve
force
do
you
think
nancy
yes
i
do
but
you
need
worry
said
harding
mickey
knows
that
himself
did
you
hear
him
say
soon
as
he
read
it
that
he
had
the
education
yet
he
taken
care
of
himself
too
long
to
spoil
his
life
now
and
he
will
see
it
but
i
marvel
at
chaffner
he
ought
to
have
known
better
and
among
us
i
wonder
at
mickey
where
did
he
get
it
from
easy
said
peter
from
a
intelligent
mother
and
an
irresponsible
irish
father
from
inborn
ingrained
sense
of
right
and
a
scuffle
with
life
in
multiopolis
gutters
mickey
is
all
right
and
thank
god
he
if
he
does
show
signs
of
wanting
to
go
to
the
office
discourage
him
all
you
can
ma
it
be
good
for
him
yet
no
it
would
but
it
would
be
because
he
needs
solid
study
and
school
routine
to
settle
him
and
make
him
instead
of
a
clown
as
that
would
at
his
age
but
if
you
think
there
is
anything
in
the
office
that
could
mickey
you
got
another
think
coming
it
would
hurt
mickey
but
it
would
be
mighty
good
for
the
rest
of
them
the
has
more
honour
and
conscience
than
most
some
of
the
papers
are
just
disgraceful
in
what
they
publish
and
then
take
back
next
day
while
folks
are
forced
to
endure
it
sit
up
and
eat
your
dinners
now
i
want
to
get
on
with
my
work
mickey
what
happened
begged
peaches
as
mickey
came
in
sight
carrying
the
papers
he
was
trembling
and
tensely
excited
as
her
sharp
eyes
could
see
they
rested
probingly
a
second
on
him
then
on
the
paper
her
lips
tightened
while
her
eyes
darkened
she
stretched
out
her
hand
mickey
let
me
see
she
commanded
mickey
knelt
beside
her
spreading
out
the
sheet
then
he
took
her
hand
setting
a
finger
on
the
first
letter
of
his
name
and
slowly
moved
along
as
she
repeated
the
letters
she
knew
best
of
all
then
softly
pronounced
the
name
she
knew
the
too
she
sat
so
straight
mickey
was
afraid
she
would
strain
her
back
lifting
her
head
like
a
queen
if
a
queen
lifts
her
head
just
as
high
as
her
neck
can
possibly
stretch
and
smiled
a
cold
little
smile
of
supreme
now
mickey
go
on
and
read
what
you
wrote
about
her
highness
commanded
the
collapse
of
mickey
was
sudden
and
complete
he
stared
at
peaches
at
the
paper
opened
his
lips
thought
a
lie
and
discarded
it
shut
his
lips
to
pen
the
lie
in
for
sure
and
humbly
and
contritely
waited
a
silent
candidate
for
mercy
peaches
had
none
to
her
this
was
the
logical
outcome
of
what
she
had
been
led
to
expect
there
was
the
paper
the
paper
was
the
there
was
the
front
page
there
was
mickey
name
she
had
no
conception
of
mickey
writing
a
line
which
did
concern
her
also
he
had
expressly
stated
that
all
of
them
and
the
whole
book
were
to
be
about
her
she
indicated
the
paper
and
his
name
while
the
condescension
of
her
waiting
began
to
be
touched
with
impatience
mickey
why
do
you
go
on
and
read
what
it
says
about
me
she
demanded
mickey
saw
plainly
what
must
be
done
he
gazed
at
her
and
suddenly
for
the
first
time
a
wave
of
something
new
and
undefined
rushed
through
him
this
exquisitely
delicate
and
beautiful
little
highness
sitting
so
proudly
straight
and
so
uncompromisingly
demanding
that
he
redeem
his
promises
made
a
double
appeal
to
mickey
her
highness
scared
him
until
he
was
cold
inside
he
was
afraid
and
he
knew
it
he
wanted
to
run
and
he
knew
it
yet
no
band
of
steel
could
have
held
him
as
this
bit
of
white
femininity
beginning
to
glow
a
soft
pink
from
slowly
enriching
blood
now
held
and
forever
would
hold
him
and
best
of
all
he
knew
that
it
was
in
his
heart
to
be
a
gentleman
there
was
nothing
left
save
to
be
one
now
he
took
both
peaches
hands
and
began
preparing
her
gently
as
was
in
his
power
for
what
had
to
come
yes
he
said
i
read
it
to
you
but
you
understand
i
tell
you
i
always
understand
she
said
sweepingly
you
know
how
wild
like
i
came
home
last
night
explained
mickey
well
i
had
reason
some
folks
who
have
been
good
to
us
and
that
i
love
like
we
love
peter
and
ma
had
been
in
awful
danger
of
something
that
would
make
them
sore
all
their
lives
and
maybe
i
had
some
little
part
in
putting
it
over
so
it
never
touched
them
anyway
they
thought
so
and
i
was
tickled
past
all
sense
and
reason
about
it
it
was
up
to
the
editor
of
the
to
decide
and
what
he
did
was
what
i
begged
him
to
course
left
to
himself
he
would
it
anyway
he
had
time
to
mickey
read
my
piece
about
me
an
then
talk
urged
peaches
honey
you
make
me
so
sick
i
ca
tell
you
mickey
what
the
matter
peaches
penetrating
eyes
were
slowly
changing
to
accusing
she
drew
a
deep
breath
giving
him
his
first
cold
unrelenting
look
mister
michael
she
said
in
incisive
tones
did
you
write
a
piece
for
the
first
page
of
the
about
me
well
miss
chicken
he
cried
i
wish
you
would
talk
so
much
i
wish
you
let
me
you
i
guess
you
ai
got
anything
to
tell
said
peaches
folding
her
arms
and
tilting
her
chin
so
high
mickey
feared
she
might
topple
backward
i
guess
i
have
shouted
mickey
did
put
that
there
i
it
to
there
if
i
it
there
and
it
there
and
knowed
it
would
there

miss
any
single
time

i
said
i
would

this
admitted
peaches

mickey
i

you
i
do
and
when
i
tell
you
i
tell
true
miss

that
in
your
system
if
you
let
me
explain
how
it
was
you
see
that
i
did
have
a
single
thing
to
do
with
it
peaches
accomplished
a
shrug
that
was
wonderful
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
her
lips
closed
mickey
watched
her
a
second
then
he
began
softly
i
do
see
what
you
mean
i
do
know
why
you
act
like
this
i
do
know
what
to
have
a
tantrum
for
when
i
it
to
be
there
and
did
it
would
be
there
honest
i
do
go
on
an
read
it
she
commanded
mickey
obeyed
as
he
finished
she
faced
him
in
wonder
why
they
ai
a
damn
bit
of
sense
to
it
she
cried
there
ai
agreed
mickey
course
there
no
sense
to
anything
that
was
about
then
what
did
you
put
it
there
in
my
place
for
i
did
i
trying
to
tell
you
persisted
mickey
peaches
shed
one
degree
of
royal
hauteur
well
why
do
you
go
on
tell
then
well
if
you
do
maneuver
to
beat
a
monoplane
i
tried
to
tell
you
and
you
wo
me
if
you
stop
me
again
i
going
to
march
out
of
this
room
and
stay
you
bawl
your
eyes
red
for
me
if
you
go
i
call
junior
said
peaches
instantly
well
go
on
and
call
him
he
turned
his
heart
throbbing
his
eyes
burning
with
repressed
tears
the
big
gulp
in
his
throat
audible
to
peaches
as
her
little
wail
was
to
him
he
whirled
and
dropping
on
his
knees
took
her
in
his
arms
she
threw
hers
around
his
neck
buried
her
face
against
his
cheek
and
they
cried
it
out
together
at
last
she
produced
a
bit
of
linen
and
mopped
mickey
eyes
and
face
then
her
own
while
still
clinging
to
him
she
whispered
mickey
i
jus
about
to
have
it
be
the
an
the
an
an
about
i
just
as
sorry
as
you
are
said
mickey
it
was
this
way
i
was
just
crazy
over
things
our
did
that
saved
our
dear
boss
and
the
lovely
moonshine
lady
who
gave
you
your
precious
child
and
her
old
daddy
from
such
awful
trouble
it
would
just
them
honest
it
would
lily
when
our
was
so
great
and
nice
and
did
what
he
did
to
at
all
i
went
sort
of
wild
like
and
when
i
was
off
for
the
day
and
got
on
the
streets
everything
pulled
me
his
way
i
was
anxious
just
to
see
him
again
and
if
i
done
what
i
wanted
to
i
in
the
office
and
knelt
down
and
said
you
oh
thank
you
and
kissed
his
feet
but
of
course
i
knew
men
did
do
like
that
and
it
would
have
shamed
him
but
i
had
to
do
something
or
bust
and
i
went
running
for
the
office
like
flying
and
my
mind
got
whirling
around
and
that
stuff
began
to
come
i
slipped
in
and
back
to
his
desk
like
i
may
if
i
want
to
and
there
he
sat
he
had
a
big
white
sheet
just
like
this
before
it
is
printed
spread
out
and
a
pencil
in
his
fingers
and
about
a
dozen
of
his
best
men
were
crowding
with
what
they
had
for
the
paper
told
you
how
they
do
it
often
and
when
i
edged
up
some
of
the
men
saw
me
they
knew
i
had
a
pass
to
him
so
they
stepped
back
just
as
he
said
boys
who
got
some
to
fill
the
space
of
our
departed
scoop
that
word
means
lost
gone
and
it
what
they
say
about
people
when
they
they
go
for
good
then
he
looked
up
to
see
who
would
speak
first
and
noticed
me
there
is
the
little
villain
who
scooped
our
scoop
right
now
he
said
make
him
fill
the
space
he
cut
us
out
of
i
thought
it
was
a
joke
but
i
was
going
to
have
all
that
bunch
of
the
swellest
smarties
who
work
for
him
put
it
clear
over
me
i
kidded
back
with
my
paper
men
too
long
for
that
so
i
stepped
back
and
shot
it
at
him
that
printed
there
and
when
i
got
to
the
end
and
invited
the
fellows
to
lily
you
could
them
a
mile
i
saw
they
was
starting
for
me
so
i
just
slung
in
a
you
something
awful
boss
and
ducked
through
and
between
and
cut
for
life
if
they
me
i
might
there
yet
they
are
the
men
on
earth
but
they
get
a
little
keyed
up
sometimes
and
a
kid
like
me
could
keep
even
now
that
all
there
is
to
it
lily
honest
cross
my
heart
i
know
they
would
put
it
there
i
did
know
they
thought
it
was
enough
i
would
them
for
the
life
of
them
if
they
was
going
to
you
jus
said
it
once
mickey
inquired
peaches
jus
once
fast
as
i
could
rattle
it
twice
as
long
as
mine
ever
are
she
said
i
do
see
how
they
oh
that
cried
mickey
why
honey
that
easy
those
fellows
jump
on
to
a
thing
like
chained
lightning
and
they
got
a
way
of
writing
that
is
just
a
lot
of
little
twists
and
curls
but
one
means
a
whole
sentence
they
call
it
and
doing
that
way
they
can
set
down
talk
as
fast
as
anybody
can
speak
and
there
were
a
dozen
of
them
there
with
pencils
and
paper
in
their
fingers
that
was
anything
for
them
mickey
are
you
going
to
learn
to
write
that
way
sure
said
mickey
before
i
go
to
the
to
take
my
desk
and
my
i
got
to
know
and
you
ought
to
know
too
i
always
have
to
bring
what
i
write
to
you
first
to
see
if
you
like
it
yes
if
the
mean
old
things
do
go
an
steal
my
place
again
when
you
do
know
it
protested
peaches
well
do
you
fret
about
that
said
mickey
they
got
away
with
me
this
time
but
they
wo
ever
again
i
be
on
to
their
tricks
see
now
say
you
forgive
me
and
eat
your
dinner
it
will
be
spoiled
and
you
must
have
a
good
rest
for
there
going
to
be
something
lovely
afterward
you
ai
mad
at
me
any
more
lily
no
i
ai
mad
at
you
but
i
just
so
wope
wope
cautioned
mickey
peaches
pulled
away
so
so
so
at
those
paper
men
mickey
i
do
think
i
ever
let
you
be
a
man
at
all
if
they
going
to
leave
me
out
like
that
what
do
you
care
about
an
old
paper
sold
on
the
streets
and
ground
up
for
buckets
and
used
to
start
fires
anyway
scoffed
mickey
why
do
you
sit
up
on
the
shelf
in
a
nice
pretty
silk
dress
and
be
a
book
lady
i
would
be
in
the
papers
at
all
if
i
were
you
no
an
i
wo
either
cried
peaches
instantly
take
the
old
paper
an
put
what
you
please
in
it
i
shall
have
all
about
in
the
nice
silky
covered
book
on
the
shelf
so
there
you
need
try
to
make
me
do
anything
else
i
sha
ever
course
you
sha
agreed
mickey
he
went
back
to
the
dinner
table
to
find
the
family
finished
and
gone
he
carried
what
had
been
left
for
him
to
the
back
porch
and
eating
hastily
began
helping
to
get
things
in
place
as
always
he
went
to
harding
for
orders
she
was
a
little
woman
so
very
like
his
mother
in
size
colouring
speech
and
manner
that
mickey
could
almost
forget
she
was
not
truly
his
when
every
hour
she
made
him
feel
her
motherly
kindness
so
from
early
habit
it
was
natural
with
him
to
seek
her
first
and
do
what
he
could
to
assist
her
before
he
attempted
anything
else
all
the
help
peter
had
from
him
came
when
he
found
no
more
to
do
for
harding
as
he
washed
the
dishes
while
she
sat
sewing
for
the
renovation
of
the
house
he
said
to
her
when
you
dress
lily
for
this
afternoon
i
wish
you
make
her
just
as
pretty
as
you
can
and
put
her
very
nicest
dress
on
her
why
mickey
is
some
one
coming
she
asked
i
do
know
said
mickey
but
i
have
a
hunch
that
my
boss
and
miss
leslie
and
her
father
may
be
out
this
afternoon
they
have
been
talking
about
it
a
long
time
but
i
kept
making
every
excuse
i
could
think
up
to
keep
them
away
why
mickey
asked
harding
looking
at
him
intently
she
paused
in
her
sewing
running
the
needle
slowly
across
the
curtain
material
well
for
a
lot
of
reasons
said
mickey
a
fellow
of
my
size
often
tackle
a
family
and
when
he
does
if
he
going
to
be
square
about
it
he
has
got
to
do
a
lot
of
one
thing
was
that
hard
for
me
to
get
lily
out
my
head
like
i
first
saw
her
i
guess
i
could
tell
you
so
you
get
a
fair
idea
of
how
dark
dirty
alone
and
little
and
miserable
she
was
just
with
all
my
heart
i
was
ashamed
of
her
folks
and
sick
sorry
for
her
but
i
ca
bear
for
anybody
else
to
be
i
did
want
any
of
them
to
see
her
she
was
fed
and
fatted
up
a
lot
and
trained
how
nice
she
really
is
shows
plain
it
just
hurt
me
to
think
of
it
agreed
harding
differing
emotions
showing
on
her
face
i
see
mickey
then
continued
mickey
i
sticking
sore
and
mean
on
one
point
i
find
her
she
mine
i
going
to
keep
her
nobody
in
all
this
world
takes
her
nor
god
in
heaven
mickey
be
careful
what
you
say
she
cautioned
i
do
mean
anything
wicked
explained
mickey
i
just
telling
you
that
nobody
on
earth
can
have
her
and
i
fight
i
die
with
her
before
even
heaven
gets
her
i
do
mean
anything
ugly
about
it
just
telling
you
friendly
like
how
i
about
her
i
see
mickey
said
harding
go
on
well
lots
of
reasons
said
mickey
she
was
used
to
folks
so
they
scared
her
she
was
crazy
with
fear
about
the
orphings
home
getting
her
while
i
was
any
too
sure
myself
i
flagged
one
swell
dame
and
like
to
got
caught
in
a
trap
and
lost
her
then
my
sunshine
nurse
helped
me
all
i
needed
so
not
knowing
how
much
women
were
alike
i
did
care
to
go
rushing
in
a
lot
on
lily
just
to
find
out
she
was
a
little
too
precious
to
experiment
with
that
home
business
has
been
a
big
grinning
devil
peeping
the
corner
at
me
ever
since
mother
went
i
could
dodge
him
for
myself
but
i
could
take
any
for
lily
orphings
homes
ai
no
place
for
of
the
law
building
them
and
penning
the
little
souls
starving
for
home
and
love
in
them
what
it
do
is
to
make
people
who
pay
the
money
to
run
them
take
the
children
in
their
and
love
and
raise
them
if
every
family
in
the
world
that
has
no
children
would
take
two
and
them
that
has
would
take
just
one
all
the
homes
would
make
good
hospitals
and
schools
while
the
orphings
would
be
fixed
like
lily
and
i
are
course
i
know
all
folks
ai
the
same
as
you
and
peter
but
in
the
long
run
children
are
in
than
they
are
in
any
kind
of
a
home
beats
no
home
at
all
you
can
stake
your
on
that
you
surely
can
agreed
harding
you
just
bet
persisted
mickey
when
i
did
know
what
they
would
do
i
did
want
them
pestering
maybe
to
ruin
everything
and
when
i
i
did
want
them
any
more
then
i
saw
their
idea
would
be
to
take
her
themselves
and
in
one
day
they
would
all
i
could
do
look
like
thirty
cents
she
was
mine
and
what
she
had
with
me
was
so
much
better
than
what
she
would
without
me
or
if
the
law
got
her
that
i
thought
she
was
doing
well
enough
i
see
now
she
could
more
but
i
thought
then
it
was
all
right
now
mickey
do
begin
that
said
harding
what
you
did
was
to
find
her
and
without
a
doubt
save
her
life
at
least
if
you
did
you
landed
her
in
a
fairly
decent
home
where
all
of
us
will
help
you
do
you
think
best
for
her
and
there
small
question
but
we
can
beat
any
orphans
home
yet
in
existence
and
as
for
the
condition
in
which
i
found
her
it
growing
warm
in
that
room
but
i
face
any
court
in
the
universe
and
swear
i
never
saw
a
cleaner
child
or
one
in
better
condition
for
what
you
had
to
begin
on
the
almighty
himself
could
have
covered
those
awful
bones
with
flesh
and
muscle
and
smoothed
the
bed
sores
and
scars
from
that
little
body
and
gone
much
faster
training
her
right
unless
he
was
going
back
to
miracles
again
as
far
as
miracles
are
concerned
i
think
from
what
you
tell
me
and
what
the
child
condition
proves
that
you
have
performed
the
miracle
yourself
to
the
day
of
my
death
i
honour
respect
and
love
you
mickey
for
the
way
in
which
you
done
it
i
yet
to
see
a
woman
who
could
have
done
better
so
i
want
you
to
know
it
i
do
know
the
right
words
to
say
to
you
and
peter
never
mind
that
said
harding
we
owe
you
quite
as
much
and
something
we
are
equally
as
thankful
for
it
an
even
break
with
us
mickey
and
no
talk
of
obligations
on
either
side
we
prize
junior
as
he
is
just
now
fully
as
much
as
you
do
anything
you
gained
mickey
polished
the
plates
and
studied
harding
then
he
spoke
again
there
one
more
obligation
i
just
itching
to
owe
you
tell
me
about
it
mickey
she
said
well
right
in
line
with
what
we
been
talking
of
said
mickey
just
suppose
a
big
car
comes
chuffing
up
here
this
afternoon
like
i
have
a
hunch
it
will
and
all
those
nice
folks
so
polite
and
beautifully
dressed
come
to
see
us
i
know
you
are
busy
but
i
work
afterward
to
pay
back
if
you
and
peter
will
dust
up
a
little
course
i
know
the
upset
fix
we
are
in
but
just
glorify
a
trifle
and
lay
off
and
right
on
the
job
without
a
second
of
letting
they
are
gone
see
you
mean
you
do
want
to
be
left
with
them
you
get
me
cried
mickey
you
get
me
clearly
i
do
want
to
be
left
alone
with
them
for
them
to
put
ideas
in
lily
head
about
a
nicer
car
than
ours
and
a
bigger
house
and
finer
dolls
and
dresses
and
going
to
the
city
to
stay
with
them
on
visits
or
me
going
to
live
with
winton
to
be
the
son
he
should
have
found
for
himself
long
ago
i
guess
i
have
lily
sized
up
about
as
close
as
the
next
one
and
she
has
got
all
that
is
for
her
right
now
she
make
the
worst
spoiled
kid
you
ever
saw
if
she
had
half
a
chance
what
she
needs
to
make
a
grand
woman
of
her
like
you
and
mother
is
clean
air
quiet
good
food
like
she
got
here
with
bone
as
well
as
muscle
in
it
and
just
enough
lessons
and
child
play
with
children
to
keep
her
brains
going
as
fast
as
her
body
and
no
silly
pampering
to
make
her
foolish
and
disagreeable
i
know
how
little
and
sick
she
is
but
she
sha
use
it
for
capital
to
spoil
her
whole
life
see
a
glass
darkly
quoted
harding
laughing
oh
mickey
i
did
think
it
of
you
you
deeper
than
the
well
that
all
right
said
mickey
his
face
flushing
often
i
hear
you
say
good
enough
alone
my
sentiments
exact
lily
is
fine
and
so
am
i
let
us
alone
if
you
and
peter
will
do
me
the
favour
as
he
would
say
you
dust
up
and
up
and
the
very
first
hint
that
comes
it
coming
at
the
very
first
hint
of
how
miss
leslie
would
love
to
take
care
of
the
dear
little
darling
awhile
smash
down
with
the
nix
like
sixty
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
and
if
you
could
dearest
lady
beat
them
to
it
i
be
tickled
silly
if
you
manage
if
you
could
only
tell
them
how
careful
she
has
to
be
handled
and
taken
care
of
and
how
strangers
and
many
around
would
be
bad
for
her
mickey
the
minute
they
see
the
shape
things
are
in
here
it
will
give
them
the
chance
they
are
after
so
they
will
begin
that
very
thing
she
said
i
know
it
conceded
mickey
that
why
i
put
them
off
if
i
could
we
were
fixed
and
quiet
again
but
at
their
chance
so
grand
this
is
worrying
lily
any
she
saw
all
of
it
happen
she
knows
what
going
on
what
i
want
dearest
lady
is
for
you
to
get
on
the
job
and
spunk
up
to
them
just
like
you
did
about
junior
going
away
i
did
think
you
get
through
with
that
and
i
know
peter
did
but
you
fine
now
if
you
and
peter
would
have
a
little
private
understanding
and
engineer
this
visit
that
i
scent
in
the
air
so
that
when
you
see
they
are
going
to
offer
pressing
invitations
to
take
lily
and
to
take
me
and
put
me
at
work
that
i
was
born
to
do
if
you
only
have
a
receiver
out
and
when
your
wires
warn
you
coming
down
the
line
first
and
beforehand
and
fix
things
so
the
nix
would
even
be
needed
do
you
get
me
dearest
mother
harding
do
you
see
that
i
do
said
harding
rising
abruptly
i
go
and
speak
to
peter
at
once
then
we
shift
these
workmen
back
and
quiet
them
as
much
as
we
can
i
slip
on
a
fresh
dress
and
put
some
buttermilk
in
the
well
and
fix
peaches
right
away
if
she
finished
her
nap
harding
voice
trailed
back
telling
what
she
would
do
as
she
hastened
to
peter
mickey
with
anxious
heart
helped
all
he
could
washed
slipped
on
a
fresh
shirt
and
watched
the
process
of
adjusting
peaches
hair
ribbon
now
understand
i
do
they
coming
he
said
i
just
they
will
because
he
thought
so
for
an
hour
the
harding
premises
wore
a
noticeable
air
of
expectation
all
the
family
were
clean
and
purposely
keeping
so
but
the
waiting
was
long
while
work
was
piled
high
in
any
direction
peaches
started
the
return
to
normal
conditions
by
calling
for
her
slate
and
beginning
to
copy
her
lesson
mary
with
many
promises
not
to
scatter
her
scraps
sat
beside
the
couch
cutting
bright
pictures
from
the
papers
mickey
grew
restless
and
began
breaking
up
the
remains
of
packing
cases
while
junior
went
after
the
wheelbarrow
harding
brought
out
her
sewing
and
peter
went
back
to
scraping
black
walnut
furniture
mickey
passed
him
on
an
errand
to
the
kitchen
and
asked
anxiously
did
she
tell
you
yes
said
peter
will
you
make
it
a
plain
case
of
home
nobody
home
questioned
mickey
i
will
said
peter
emphatically
being
busy
the
big
car
ran
to
the
gate
before
they
saw
it
coming
leslie
winton
and
douglas
bruce
came
up
the
walk
together
while
winton
and
minturn
waited
in
the
car
in
accordance
with
a
suggestion
from
douglas
that
the
little
sick
girl
must
not
see
too
many
strange
people
at
once
mickey
went
to
meet
them
and
peaches
watching
half
in
fear
and
wholly
in
pride
saw
douglas
bruce
shake
his
hand
until
she
frowned
lest
it
hurt
clap
him
on
the
back
and
cry
oh
but
i
proud
of
you
say
that
was
great
leslie
purposely
dressed
to
emphasize
her
beauty
slipped
an
arm
across
his
shoulders
and
drawing
him
to
her
kissed
his
brow
our
poet
she
said
oh
mickey
hurry
i
so
eager
to
hear
the
ones
in
the
book
douglas
tells
me
you
are
making
wo
you
please
read
them
to
us
mickey
smiled
as
he
led
the
way
just
nonsense
stuff
for
lily
he
said
nothing
but
fooling
only
the
prayer
one
and
maybe
two
others
an
abrupt
movement
from
peaches
as
they
advanced
made
harding
glance
her
way
in
time
to
see
the
first
wave
of
deep
colour
that
ever
had
flooded
the
child
white
face
come
creeping
up
her
neck
and
begin
tinging
her
cheeks
even
her
forehead
with
a
swift
movement
she
snatched
her
poetry
book
which
always
lay
with
her
slate
and
primer
thrusting
it
under
her
pillow
when
she
saw
harding
watching
her
she
tilted
her
head
and
pursed
her
lips
in
scorn
she
mimicked
wonder
whose
she
thinks
he
is
nix
on
her
harding
caught
surprisedly
struggled
to
suppress
a
laugh
as
she
turned
to
meet
her
guests
mickey
noticed
this
he
made
his
introductions
and
swiftly
thrust
peaches
precious
child
into
her
arms
warning
in
a
whisper
be
careful
miss
peaches
needed
the
reminder
she
loved
the
doll
she
had
been
drilled
so
often
on
the
thanks
she
was
to
tender
for
it
that
with
it
in
her
fingers
she
thought
of
nothing
else
so
her
smile
as
leslie
approached
was
lovely
she
held
out
her
hand
and
before
mickey
could
speak
announced
jus
as
glad
to
see
you
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
my
precious
child
nothing
more
was
necessary
leslie
was
captivated
and
would
scarcely
make
way
for
douglas
to
offer
his
greeting
mary
ran
to
call
her
father
while
the
visitors
seated
themselves
to
say
the
customary
polite
things
but
each
of
them
watched
a
tiny
creature
with
pink
ribbons
to
match
the
colour
in
a
flawless
little
face
rounded
to
the
point
of
delicate
beauty
overshadowed
by
a
shower
of
gold
curls
having
red
lips
and
lighted
by
a
pair
of
big
eyes
with
long
dark
lashes
when
harding
saw
both
visitors
look
so
intently
at
peaches
and
intercepted
their
glance
of
admiration
toward
each
other
she
looked
again
herself
and
then
once
more
peaches
spoke
imperiously
come
here
and
bend
down
your
head
mickey
slipped
behind
douglas
chair
knelt
on
one
knee
and
leaned
to
see
what
peaches
desired
of
him
she
drew
her
hankerchief
from
her
waist
ribbon
rubbed
it
across
his
forehead
looked
at
the
spot
with
frowning
intentness
rubbed
again
and
then
dropping
the
handkerchief
laid
a
hand
on
each
side
of
his
head
bent
it
to
her
and
kissed
the
spot
fervently
then
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
said
with
solicitous
but
engaging
sweetness
i
do
wish
you
would
be
more
careful
what
you
get
on
your
face
mickey
drew
back
thrilled
with
delight
but
extremely
embarrassed
you
fool
little
kid
he
muttered
and
could
not
look
at
his
friends
watching
douglas
almost
shouted
while
the
flush
deepened
on
miss
winton
cheeks
peter
began
talking
to
help
the
situation
so
all
of
them
joined
in
you
are
making
improvements
that
look
very
interesting
around
here
said
douglas
to
harding
we
are
doing
our
level
best
to
evolve
a
sanitary
modern
home
for
all
of
us
and
to
set
an
example
for
our
neighbours
she
said
quietly
we
always
got
along
very
well
as
we
were
but
lately
we
have
found
we
could
have
things
much
more
convenient
and
when
god
gave
us
two
more
dear
children
we
needed
room
for
them
and
comforts
and
appliances
to
take
care
of
our
little
new
daughter
right
when
we
got
started
one
thing
led
to
another
until
we
are
pretty
well
torn
up
but
we
saved
the
best
place
for
her
and
the
worst
is
over
yes
we
are
on
the
finish
now
said
peter
i
did
think
of
taking
her
and
going
to
my
sister
continued
harding
but
peaches
is
accustomed
to
meeting
people
while
mickey
and
i
both
thought
being
among
strangers
and
changing
beds
and
food
would
be
worse
for
her
than
the
annoyance
of
remodelling
then
too
i
wanted
very
much
to
see
the
work
here
done
as
i
desired
at
first
i
was
doubtful
about
keeping
her
but
she
does
mind
in
the
least
she
even
takes
her
afternoon
naps
with
hammers
pounding
not
so
far
from
her
gee
there
is
no
noise
and
jar
here
to
compare
with
multiopolis
said
mickey
she
all
right
getting
stronger
every
day
peaches
spread
both
hands
looking
at
them
critically
back
and
palm
they
are
better
she
said
you
ought
to
seen
them
when
they
was
so
clawy
they
made
mickey
shiver
if
i
touched
him
and
first
time
i
wanted
to
kiss
something
or
go
like
granny
did
he
would
let
me
i
cried
an
then
he
made
me
put
it
on
his
forehead
long
time
i
got
so
the
bones
did
scratch
him
did
you
mickey
well
i
wish
you
would
tell
everything
then
i
wo
said
peaches
your
an
i
must
do
what
say
an
are
an
you
must
do
what
say
are
you
a
she
questioned
leslie
and
douglas
we
hope
to
be
soon
laughed
leslie
then
said
peaches
you
can
look
how
we
fixing
our
house
so
you
can
make
yours
nice
as
this
mickey
i
want
to
show
that
pretty
lady
in
the
my
precious
child
sure
said
mickey
i
go
tell
her
and
the
man
with
her
is
miss
leslie
father
just
like
peter
is
ours
you
want
to
show
him
the
child
do
you
maybe
said
peaches
with
a
tantalizing
smirk
miss
chicken
you
getting
well
too
fast
commented
mickey
in
amazement
as
he
started
to
the
car
because
of
what
winton
had
said
to
him
the
previous
day
he
composed
and
delivered
this
greeting
when
he
reached
it
lily
is
asking
to
show
you
her
precious
child
minturn
and
i
want
both
of
you
to
see
our
home
and
meet
our
new
father
and
mother
letting
us
have
them
is
one
thing
the
law
does
that
makes
up
a
little
for
the
orphings
homes
most
kids
get
who
have
had
the
bad
luck
to
lose
their
own
folks
mickey
are
you
prejudiced
against
orphans
homes
asked
minturn
as
she
stepped
from
the
car
ai
no
name
for
it
said
mickey
i
dead
against
bunching
children
in
squads
if
rich
folks
want
to
do
something
worth
while
with
their
money
they
can
do
it
by
each
family
taking
as
many
orphings
as
they
can
afford
and
raising
them
personal
see
i
should
say
i
do
exclaimed
the
lady
i
must
speak
to
james
about
that
we
have
two
of
our
own
and
william
but
i
believe
we
could
manage
a
few
more
i
know
one
i
like
very
much
to
try
said
winton
but
mickey
never
appeared
so
unconscious
he
managed
his
introductions
very
well
while
again
peaches
justified
her
appellation
by
being
temptingly
sweet
and
conspicuously
acid
when
mickey
reached
peter
in
his
round
of
making
friends
acquainted
he
slid
his
arm
through
that
of
the
big
man
and
said
smilingly
nobody
is
going
to
mix
me
with
peter
son
by
blood
see
what
a
fine
chap
junior
is
but
peter
and
i
fixed
up
my
sonship
with
the
almighty
whom
my
peter
did
deny
when
he
took
me
in
and
with
the
judge
of
the
multiopolis
courts
so
even
if
it
does
show
on
the
outside
i
belong
do
i
peter
threw
his
left
arm
around
mickey
even
as
he
shook
hands
with
his
right
you
surely
do
he
said
by
law
and
by
love
to
the
bottom
of
all
our
hearts
the
visit
was
a
notable
success
the
buttermilk
was
cold
the
spice
cake
was
fresh
the
apples
and
peaches
were
juicy
the
improvements
highly
commendable
peter
was
asked
if
he
would
consider
a
membership
in
the
golf
club
the
playhouse
was
discussed
and
three
hours
later
a
group
of
warm
friends
parted
with
the
agreement
that
mickey
was
to
spend
a
day
of
the
latter
part
of
the
week
fishing
on
atwater
the
hardings
smiled
broadly
well
son
did
we
manage
that
to
your
satisfaction
asked
peter
sure
said
mickey
i
might
have
been
mistaken
in
what
half
of
that
trip
was
for
but
i
think
not
so
do
i
said
harding
emphatically
they
were
just
itching
to
get
their
fingers
on
peaches
while
bruce
and
winton
both
were
chagrined
over
our
getting
you
first
we
feel
bad
about
that
too
do
we
peter
laughed
mickey
well
i
would
said
peter
if
it
were
the
other
way
around
i
mind
the
young
fellow
you
be
with
him
every
day
and
he
soon
have
boys
of
his
own
no
doubt
but
i
feel
sorry
for
winton
he
looks
hungry
when
he
watches
you
he
could
work
you
into
his
business
fine
he
all
right
he
a
nice
man
said
mickey
but
i
lived
off
the
all
my
life
this
summer
so
when
school
is
over
i
go
straight
to
mr
chaffner
the
winton
car
ran
to
the
club
house
sitting
in
a
group
the
occupants
looked
at
each
other
rather
foolishly
seems
to
me
you
were
going
to
bring
peaches
right
along
if
you
liked
her
leslie
laughed
douglas
the
little
vixen
she
said
flushing
sorry
you
did
care
for
her
he
commented
it
is
a
pity
said
leslie
but
i
did
bringing
her
any
farther
than
minturn
missed
taking
her
to
the
hospital
to
be
examined
and
treated
i
have
to
go
again
about
that
said
minturn
i
just
seem
to
get
at
it
someway
no
you
could
seem
to
agreed
douglas
and
winton
could
seem
to
lay
covetous
hands
on
mickey
and
bear
him
away
to
be
his
assistant
any
more
than
i
could
force
him
to
be
my
little
brother
i
hope
all
of
us
have
a
realizing
sense
that
we
are
permitted
to
be
good
and
loyal
friends
but
we
will
kindly
leave
mickey
to
make
his
own
arrangements
and
work
out
his
own
salvation
and
that
of
his
child
and
leslie
i
did
hear
you
offering
to
buy
any
of
the
quaint
dishes
and
old
furniture
you
hoped
you
might
pick
up
there
either
heavens
cried
leslie
half
tearfully
how
would
any
one
go
about
offering
to
buy
an
old
platter
that
was
wrapped
in
a
silk
shawl
and
kept
in
the
dresser
drawer
during
repairs
or
ask
a
man
to
set
a
price
on
old
furniture
when
he
was
scraping
off
the
varnish
of
generations
and
showing
you
wood
grain
and
colouring
with
the
pride
of
a
veteran
collector
i
feel
so
silly
let
play
off
our
chagrin
and
then
be
in
condition
for
friendship
which
is
the
part
that
falls
to
us
if
i
understand
mickey
well
considering
the
taste
i
had
of
the
quality
of
his
friendship
i
hope
you
wo
be
surprised
at
the
statement
that
i
feel
highly
honoured
said
winton
leading
the
way
while
the
others
thoughtfully
followed
with
four
days
work
the
harding
home
began
to
show
what
was
being
accomplished
the
song
of
the
housewife
carried
to
the
highway
neighbours
passing
went
home
to
silent
overworked
drudges
and
critically
examined
for
the
first
time
stuffy
dark
kitchens
reeking
with
steam
heat
and
the
odour
of
cooking
and
decorated
with
the
grime
of
years
the
little
leaven
of
one
home
in
the
neighbourhood
as
all
homes
should
be
set
them
thinking
a
week
had
not
passed
until
people
began
calling
harding
to
the
telephone
to
explain
just
what
she
was
doing
and
why
men
would
stop
to
ask
peter
what
was
going
on
so
every
time
he
caught
a
victim
he
never
released
him
until
the
man
saw
sunrise
above
a
kitchen
table
a
line
in
the
basement
for
a
winter
wash
kitchen
implements
from
a
pot
scraper
and
food
pusher
to
a
gas
range
and
electric
washing
machine
with
a
furnace
and
hardwood
floors
thrown
in
soon
the
rip
of
shovelled
shingles
the
sound
of
sawing
and
the
ring
of
hammers
filled
the
air
the
harding
improvements
improved
so
fast
that
sand
cement
and
the
big
pile
of
lumber
began
accumulating
at
peter
corner
of
the
crossroads
below
the
home
for
the
playhouse
men
who
started
by
calling
peter
a
fool
ended
by
borrowing
his
plans
and
belabouring
themselves
for
their
foolishness
for
the
neighbourhood
was
awakening
and
beginning
to
develop
a
settled
conviction
as
to
what
constituted
the
joy
of
life
and
that
the
place
to
enjoy
it
was
at
home
and
the
time
immediately
peter
reward
was
not
only
in
renewed
happiness
for
himself
and
nancy
equal
to
it
was
his
pleasure
over
the
same
renewal
for
many
of
his
lifelong
friends
mickey
started
on
his
day
to
atwater
with
joyful
anticipation
but
he
jumped
from
douglas
car
and
ran
up
the
harding
front
walk
at
three
his
face
anxious
he
saw
the
harding
car
at
the
gate
and
wondered
at
peter
sitting
dressed
for
leisure
on
the
veranda
got
anxious
about
lily
he
explained
out
on
the
lake
i
thought
i
heard
her
call
me
then
i
had
the
notion
she
was
crying
for
me
they
laughed
at
me
but
i
could
stand
it
is
she
asleep
as
they
said
she
be
peter
opened
his
lips
but
no
word
came
mickey
slowly
turned
a
ghastly
white
peter
reached
in
his
side
pocket
drew
out
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
boy
mickey
pulled
the
sheet
from
the
envelope
still
staring
at
peter
then
glanced
at
what
he
held
and
collapsed
on
the
step
peter
moved
beside
him
laid
a
steadying
arm
across
his
shoulders
and
proved
his
fear
was
as
great
as
mickey
by
being
unable
to
speak
at
last
the
boy
produced
articulate
words
came
he
marvelled
about
ten
this
morning
said
peter

took
her
to
the
hospital

mickey

peter

said
emphatically

me
to

her
so
i
could
give
him
orders
to

ahead
when
he
came
why

you
telephone
me

mickey

said
peter
the
woman
who
answered
did
know
where
you
were
but
she
said
their
car
had
gone
to
town
so
i
thought
maybe
they
find
you
there
i
was
just
going
to
call
them
again

she
afraid

mickey
yes

think

said
peter
did
she
cry
for
me
asked
mickey
yes
she
did
admitted
peter
who
had
a
social
lie
in
his
being
but
when
he
offered
to
put
off
the
examination
till
he
might
come
again
she
climbed
from
the
cot
and
made
him
take
her
ma
went
with
her
the
sunshine
nurse
came
questioned
mickey
yes
said
peter
and
minturn
she
sent
for
him
to
see
about
an
operation
on
a
child
she
is
trying
to
save
so
when
it
was
over
he
showed
her
your
letter
she
brought
them
out
in
her
car
and
ma
went
back
with
them
she
may
be
on
that
glass
table
right
now
gulped
mickey
what
time
is
it
when
the
next
car

me
to
the
station
will
you
and
if
you
got
any
money

me
have
it
i
get
to
mine
of
course
said
peter
will
junior
and
mary
be
all
right
asked
mickey
pausing
in
his
extremity
to
think
of
others
yes
they
often
stay
while
we
go
hurry
begged
mickey
peter
took
hold
of
the
gear
and
faced
straight
ahead
she
oiled
the
tank
full
the
engine
purring
like
a
kitten
he
said
mickey
i
always
wanted
to
beat
that
trolley
just
once
to
show
it
i
if
i
was
loaded
with
women
and
children
awful
nice
road
go
on
said
mickey
peter
smiled
sliding
across
the
starter
sit
tight
he
said
tersely
the
big
car
slipped
up
the
road
no
faster
than
it
had
gone
frequently
passed
the
station
then
on
and
on
mickey
twisted
to
look
back
at
the
rattle
of
the
trolley
stopping
behind
them
watching
it
with
wishful
eye
peter
opened
his
lips
to
say
just
warmed
up
enough
and
an
even
start
the
trolley
came
abreast
and
whistled
peter
blew
his
horn
glancing
that
way
with
a
little
come
on
forward
jerk
of
his
head
the
motorman
nodded
touched
his
gear
and
the
car
started
peter
laid
prideful
loving
hands
on
his
machinery
for
the
first
time
with
legitimate
racing
excuse
as
he
long
had
wished
to
he
tried
out
his
engine
mickey
could
see
the
faces
of
the
protesting
passengers
and
the
conductor
grinning
in
the
door
but
peter
could
not
have
heard
if
he
had
tried
to
tell
him
flying
it
was
smooth
and
even
past
fields
orchards
and
houses
past
people
who
cried
out
at
them
and
shook
their
fists
mickey
looked
at
peter
and
registered
for
life
each
line
of
his
big
frame
and
lineament
of
his
face
as
he
gripped
the
gear
and
put
his
car
over
the
highway
when
they
reached
the
pavement
mickey
touched
peter
arm
wo
make
anything
by
getting
arrested
he
cautioned
no
police
for
blocks
yet
said
peter
well
there
risk
of
life
and
damage
suit
at
each
crossing
shouted
mickey
so
peter
slowed
a
degree
but
he
was
miles
ahead
of
all
regulations
as
he
stopped
before
the
gleaming
entrance
mickey
sprang
from
the
car
and
hurried
up
the
steps
minturn
arose
from
a
seat
and
came
to
meet
him
take
me
to
her
quick
begged
mickey
silently
she
led
the
way
to
her
suite
in
her
old
home
and
opened
the
door
mickey
had
a
glimpse
of
harding
his
sunshine
nurse
and
three
men
one
of
whom
he
recognized
from
reproductions
of
his
features
in
the
papers
a
very
white
peaches
stretched
both
hands
and
uttered
a
shrill
cry
as
mickey
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
answer
was
inarticulate
while
his
arms
spread
widely
then
peaches
arose
and
in
a
few
shuffling
but
sustained
steps
fell
on
his
breast
gripping
him
with
all
her
strength
oh
darling
you
kill
yourself
wailed
mickey
he
laid
her
on
the
davenport
and
knelt
clasping
her
peaches
regained
first
she
sat
up
shamelessly
wiping
mickey
eyes
and
her
own
alternately
did
you
hurt
yourself
awful
i
know
something
i
wo
tell
chanted
peaches
as
she
had
been
doing
for
days
mickey
looked
at
her
then
up
at
peter
who
had
entered
and
come
to
them
you
eagerly
asked
peter
of
the
child
peaches
nodded
proudly
to
meet
mickey
she
triumphed
i
for
anybody
else
the
longest
piece
yet
and
it
did
hurt
and
i
did
fall
good
shouted
peter
that
the
ticket
you
look
here
miss
chicken
what
do
you
mean
cried
mickey
wonderingly
oh
the
doctor
carrel
man
you
sent
for
came
explained
peaches
and
you
was
there
but
he
had
your
name
on
the
letter
you
wrote
he
showed
me
so
i
came
and
let
him
examination
me
but
peter
and
i
been
standing
alone
and
taking
steps
when
nobody
was
looking
surprised
me
joyful
so
much
it
takes
one
as
big
as
that
to
pay
you
back
mickey
clung
to
his
treasure
while
turning
to
peter
an
awed
questioning
face
that
it
said
peter
she
been
on
her
feet
for
ten
days
or
such
a
matter
mickey
appealed
to
carrel
how
about
this
he
demanded
she
going
to
walk
said
the
great
man
assuringly
it
all
over
you
performed
your
miracle
asked
mickey
yes
said
carrel
it
all
over
mickey
but
you
had
the
miracle
performed
before
i
saw
her
lad
mickey
retreated
to
peaches
neck
again
while
she
smiled
over
and
comforted
him
mickey
i
knew
you
be
crazy
she
said
i
knew
you
be
glad
but
i
did
know
you
could
be
so
mickey
took
her
in
his
arms
a
second
then
slowly
recovered
his
feet
and
a
small
amount
of
again
he
turned
to
the
surgeons
you
sure
will
it
hurt
her
will
it
last
very
sure
said
carrel
calm
yourself
lad
her
case
is
not
so
unusual
only
more
aggravated
than
usual
i
examined
her
from
crown
to
sole
and
she
straight
and
sound
you
have
started
her
permanent
cure
all
you
need
is
to
keep
on
exactly
as
you
are
going
and
limit
her
activities
so
that
in
her
joy
she
does
overdo
and
tire
herself
you
are
her
doctor
i
congratulate
you
carrel
came
forward
holding
out
his
hand
and
mickey
took
it
with
the
one
of
his
that
was
not
gripping
peaches
and
said
but
he
was
a
radiant
boy
thank
you
sir
he
said
thank
everybody
but
thank
you
especial
over
and
over
i
do
know
how
i
ever
square
up
with
you
but
pay
you
all
i
have
to
start
on
i
some
money
i
saved
from
my
wages
and
i
be
working
harder
and
earning
more
all
the
time
but
mickey
protested
the
surgeon
you
do
owe
me
anything
i
did
operate
you
had
the
work
done
before
i
arrived
i
would
have
come
sooner
but
i
knew
she
could
be
operated
even
if
her
case
demanded
it
until
she
had
gained
more
strength
he
was
watching
mickey
face
and
he
read
aright
so
he
continued
i
like
that
suggestion
you
made
in
your
letter
very
much
something
in
steadily
is
a
good
thing
for
any
man
to
have
for
the
next
three
months
suppose
you
send
me
that
two
dollars
a
week
you
offered
me
if
i
come
how
would
that
be
mickey
gathered
peaches
in
his
arms
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
started
on
the
homeward
trip
thank
you
sir
he
said
tersely
that
would
be
square
the
end
