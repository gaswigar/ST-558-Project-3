introduction
observation
and
imagination
are
the
basic
principles
of
all
poetry
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
poetical
work
from
which
one
of
them
is
wholly
absent
observation
without
imagination
makes
for
obviousness
imagination
without
observation
turns
into
nonsense
what
marks
the
world
greatest
poetry
is
perhaps
the
presence
in
almost
equal
proportion
of
both
these
principles
but
as
a
rule
we
find
one
of
them
predominating
and
from
this
emphasis
the
poetry
of
the
period
derives
its
character
as
realistic
or
idealistic
the
poetry
of
the
middle
nineteenth
century
made
a
fetish
of
observation
it
came
as
near
excluding
imagination
as
it
could
without
ceasing
entirely
to
be
poetry
that
such
exaggeration
should
sooner
or
later
result
in
a
sharp
reaction
was
natural
the
change
began
during
the
eighties
and
gathered
full
headway
in
the
early
nineties
imagination
so
long
scorned
came
into
its
rights
once
more
and
it
is
rapidly
becoming
the
dominant
note
in
the
literary
production
of
our
own
day
the
new
movement
has
been
called
and
symbolistic
both
these
names
apply
but
neither
of
them
exhausts
the
contents
or
meaning
of
the
movement
which
received
its
first
impetus
from
ibsen
and
which
later
found
its
typical
embodiment
in
maeterlinck
from
this
movement
came
much
of
the
inspiration
that
produced
the
poetical
of
ireland
out
of
which
has
sprung
the
man
whom
i
have
now
the
pleasure
of
introducing
to
american
readers
a
man
with
imagination
as
elfish
as
moonlight
mist
edward
john
moreton
drax
plunkett
lord
dunsany
is
the
eighteenth
member
of
his
family
to
bear
the
title
which
gives
him
a
place
in
the
irish
peerage
he
was
born
in
and
received
his
education
at
eton
and
sandhurst
in
he
succeeded
his
father
to
the
title
and
the
family
estate
in
meath
ireland
during
the
south
african
war
he
served
at
the
front
with
the
coldstream
guards
he
is
passionately
fond
of
outdoor
life
and
often
spends
the
whole
day
in
the
saddle
before
sitting
down
at
his
desk
to
write
late
at
night
his
work
proves
however
that
he
is
as
fond
of
spiritual
as
of
physical
exercise
and
that
he
is
an
inveterate
traveller
in
those
mysterious
regions
of
the
partly
known
or
wholly
unknown
where
the
imagination
alone
can
guide
us
his
first
literary
heroes
were
the
brothers
grimm
and
andersen
then
the
greek
world
of
olympians
was
revealed
to
him
making
a
lasting
impression
on
his
mind
but
it
was
the
bible
that
gave
him
the
limpid
style
which
makes
his
most
fantastic
tales
as
real
as
government
reports
or
rather
much
more
so
for
years
no
style
seemed
to
me
natural
but
that
of
the
bible
he
said
not
long
ago
and
i
feared
that
i
would
never
become
a
writer
when
i
saw
that
other
people
did
not
use
it
for
something
like
ten
years
he
has
been
a
pretty
frequent
and
increasingly
valued
contributor
to
english
and
periodicals
he
has
previously
published
five
volumes
the
gods
of
pegana
time
and
the
gods
the
sword
of
welleran
a
tales
and
the
book
of
wonder
all
are
collections
of
prose
pieces
that
defy
accepted
classifications
they
are
fairy
tales
and
short
stories
and
essays
and
prose
poems
at
the
same
time
the
reader
has
only
to
take
a
brief
glance
at
one
of
those
works
to
make
the
astounding
discovery
that
he
is
being
introduced
to
worlds
of
which
he
has
never
heard
before
even
the
arabian
nights
have
a
clearly
identifiable
background
of
popular
legend
and
myth
nothing
of
the
kind
is
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
lord
dunsany
he
may
be
said
to
have
created
a
new
mythology
wholly
his
own
he
is
not
only
the
master
but
the
maker
of
the
countries
to
which
he
takes
us
on
such
fascinating
jaunts
his
commonest
name
for
them
is
the
edge
of
the
world
but
sometimes
he
speaks
of
them
as
the
lands
of
wonder
this
latter
name
is
doubly
significant
for
the
whole
movement
of
which
he
forms
such
a
striking
manifestation
has
been
defined
as
a
renascence
of
wonder
the
names
of
places
and
persons
appearing
in
the
stories
of
lord
dunsany
are
worth
a
study
in
themselves
there
are
hundreds
of
them
giving
evidence
of
an
inexhaustible
imagination
and
each
one
of
them
is
as
aptly
suggestive
as
if
generations
of
men
had
been
at
work
shaping
them
to
hear
of
sardathion
the
city
built
by
the
gods
of
old
is
to
see
its
domes
of
marble
rising
in
the
air
to
hear
of
slith
and
sippy
and
slorg
the
three
thieves
who
went
to
the
edge
of
the
world
in
quest
of
the
golden
box
is
to
feel
as
if
one
were
dealing
with
historical
characters
like
aaron
burr
or
chinese
gordon
and
as
we
learn
more
about
them
these
fanciful
creatures
of
lord
dunsany
brain
assume
still
more
familiar
characteristics
as
if
they
had
been
studied
in
some
irish
village
or
english
street
it
is
this
fact
that
reveals
one
of
the
main
secrets
of
lord
appeal
that
behind
all
his
exuberant
imagination
lies
a
solid
basis
of
observation
enabling
him
to
endow
the
most
impossible
adventures
with
a
homely
and
convincing
air
the
five
plays
contained
in
the
present
volume
have
all
been
produced
on
the
stage
the
golden
doom
and
the
gods
of
the
mountain
have
been
staged
most
successfully
at
the
haymarket
theatre
london
king
argimenes
and
the
glittering
gate
have
been
given
by
the
irish
players
and
the
lost
silk
hat
has
been
put
on
by
iden
payne
at
manchester
in
america
the
first
three
have
been
in
the
repertoire
of
stuart
walker
portmanteau
theatre
and
the
glittering
gate
has
been
given
by
the
neighborhood
players
after
seeing
the
gods
of
the
mountain
frank
harris
wrote
it
was
one
of
the
nights
of
my
life
the
only
play
i
said
to
myself
which
meant
anything
to
me
in
twenty
years
or
more
without
sharing
the
opinion
of
harris
about
the
dramatic
output
of
the
last
twenty
years
i
share
fully
his
enthusiasm
in
regard
to
the
play
that
caused
his
remark
the
note
struck
in
it
is
so
distinctly
new
as
to
make
one
gasp
as
under
a
sharp
shock
but
the
surprise
turns
quickly
into
pleasure
such
as
only
the
originality
of
genius
can
confer
it
is
hard
to
define
just
what
makes
these
plays
what
they
are
but
certain
qualities
are
tangible
their
deep
and
rich
symbolism
is
one
it
is
the
kind
of
symbolism
for
which
the
advances
of
modern
psychology
had
prepared
us
the
kind
that
is
inseparable
from
life
itself
as
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
understand
it
another
quality
is
their
capacity
for
suggesting
at
once
the
intimate
unity
and
appalling
vastness
of
life
in
the
golden
doom
the
fate
of
an
empire
and
a
little
boy
desire
for
a
new
plaything
become
linked
as
facts
of
equal
importance
in
the
web
of
fate
in
the
gods
of
the
mountain
we
meet
with
an
atmosphere
of
fatality
comparable
only
to
that
found
in
the
greek
dramas
the
crime
of
which
to
the
greeks
was
the
unforgivable
sin
is
here
made
as
real
to
us
as
it
was
to
them
but
these
remarks
of
mine
about
the
inner
significance
of
the
plays
should
not
tempt
anybody
into
thinking
them
deficient
in
that
element
of
formal
perfection
without
which
they
could
not
be
classed
as
works
of
art
they
are
indeed
things
of
beauty
and
their
beauty
inheres
in
their
design
as
well
as
in
their
style
through
all
of
them
the
greatest
possible
economy
of
means
has
been
observed
so
that
not
a
word
not
a
tone
not
a
gesture
is
wasted
in
obtaining
the
effect
aimed
at
the
dialogue
of
maeterlinck
is
suggested
but
not
more
than
suggested
the
words
spoken
by
the
characters
of
maeterlinck
are
often
so
vague
as
to
be
practically
meaningless
the
characters
of
lord
dunsany
speak
as
simply
as
those
of
maeterlinck
but
always
sharply
to
the
point
there
can
be
no
mistaking
of
what
they
mean
and
that
meaning
serves
always
to
carry
the
action
of
the
play
forward
and
each
play
of
lord
dunsany
is
an
exciting
adventure
conveying
to
the
reader
an
exhilarating
sense
of
motion
without
ever
descending
to
stage
tricks
for
the
production
of
that
sense
this
means
that
they
combine
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
qualities
which
make
separately
for
theatrical
or
literary
success

reverenced

they
are
drowsy

are
of
green
jade
they
sit
with
their
right
elbows
resting
on
their
left
hands
the
right
forefinger
pointing
upward
we
will
come
into
the
city
disguised
from
the
direction
of
marma
and
will
claim
to
be
these
gods
we
must
be
seven
as
they
are
and
when
we
sit
we
must
sit
as
they
do
with
the
right

uplifted
ulf
this
is
a
bad
city
in
which
to
fall
into

of
oppressors
for

judges
lack
amiability
here
as
the
merchants
lack
benevolence
ever
since
the
gods
forgot
them
agmar
in
our
ancient
calling
a
man
may
sit
at
one
street
corner
for
fifty
years
doing
the
one
thing
and
yet
a
day
may
come
when
it
is
well
for
him
to
rise
up
and
do
another
thing
while
the
timorous
man
starves
ulf
also
it
were
well
not
to
anger
the
gods
agmar
is
not
all
life
a
beggary
to
the
gods
do
they
not
see
all
men
always
begging
of
them
and
asking
alms
with
incense
and
bells
and
subtle
devices

royal
temple

we
sit
at
a
street
corner
or
by
a
palace
gate
ulf
it
is
even
so
agmar
then
will
the
gods
be
glad
when
we
follow
the
holy
calling
with
new
devices

with
subtlety
as
they
are
glad
when
the
priests
sing
a
new
song

the
eldest
of
the
gods
he
is
no
common
god
like
us
once
a
shepherd
went
by
him
in

went
he
sent
a
doom
after
that
shepherd
citizen

hand
to
a
lamb
upon
an
that
leg
is
not
being
cooked
at

it
is
strange
that
gods
should
be
thus
anxious
about
the
cooking
of
a
leg
of
lamb
oorander
it
is
strange
certainly
illanaun
almost
i
had
said
that
it
was
a
man
spoke
then
oorander
his
beard
and
regarding
the
second
strange
strange
certainly
agmar
is
it
then
strange
that
the
gods
love
roasted
flesh
for
this
purpose
they
keep
the
lightning
when
the
lightning
flickers
about
the
limbs
of
men
there
comes
to
the
gods
in
marma
a
pleasant
smell
even
a
smell
of
roasting
sometimes
the
gods
being
pacific
are
pleased
to
have
roasted
instead
the
flesh
of
lamb
it
is
all
one
to
the
gods
let
the
roasting
stop
oorander
no
no
gods
of
the
mountains
others
no
no
oorander
quick
let
us
offer
the
flesh
to
them
if
they
eat
all
is
well
offer
it
the
beggars
eat
all
but
agmar
who
illanaun
one
who
was
ignorant
one
who
did
not
know
had
almost
said
that
they
ate
like
hungry
men
others
hush
akmos
yet
they
look
as
though
they
had
not
had
a
meal
like
this
for
a
long
time
oorander
they
have
a
hungry
look
agmar
has
not
i
have
not
eaten
since
the
world
was
very
new
and
the
flesh
of
men
was
tenderer
than
now
these
younger
gods
have
learned
the
habit
of
eating
from
the
lions
oorander
o
oldest
of
divinities
partake
partake
agmar
it
is
not
fitting
that
such
as
i
should
eat
none
eat
but
beasts
and
men
and
the
younger
gods
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
nimble
lightning
and
i
we
may
kill
and
we
may
madden
but
we
do
not
eat
akmos
if
he
but
eat
of
our
offering
he
can
not
overwhelm
us
all
oh
ancient
deity

partake
agmar
enough
let
it
be
enough
that
these
have
condescended
to
this
bestial
and
human
habit
illanaun
and
yet
he
is
not
unlike
a
beggar
whom
i
saw
no
so
long
since
oorander
but
beggars
eat
illanaun
now
i
never
knew
a
beggar
yet
who
would
refuse
a
bowl
of
woldery
wine
akmos
this
is
no
beggar
illanaun
nevertheless
let
us
offer
him
a
bowl
of
woldery
wine
akmos
you
do
wrong
to
doubt
him
illanaun
i
do
but
wish
to
prove
his
divinity
i
will
fetch
the
woldery
wine
akmos
he
will
not
drink
yet
if
he
does
then
he
will
not
overwhelm
us
let

offer
him
the
wine

the
hour
at
which
the

speak
to
the

language
of

points
one
by

at

of
the
seven

shooting
out
his
forefinger
at

does
this
each
beggar
in
his
turn
gathers
himself
back
on
to
his
throne
and
crosses
his
legs
his
right
arm
goes
stiffly
upward
with
forefinger
erect
and
a
staring
look
of
horror
comes
into
his
eyes
in
this
attitude
the
beggars
sit
motionless

a
green
light
falls
upon

sometimes
the

laugh
second

at
whom
first
sentry
at
kings
second
sentry
why
have
you
grown
uneasy
about
this
war
in
the
hills
first
sentry
because
the
king
is
powerful
beyond
any
of
his
fathers
and
has
more
fighting
men
more
horses
and
wealth
that
could
have
ransomed
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
dowered
their
queens
and
daughters
and
every
year
his
miners
bring
him
more
from
the

from

has
grown
very
mighty
second

he
will
the

him
away
king
how

first
sentry
i

majesty
king
which
way

with
one
of
his
spies
who
stoops
and
examines
the
ground
and
steals
away
the
sentry
king
his
two
remaining
what
does
this
writing
say
a
spy
we
can
not
read
majesty
king
a
good
spy
should
know
everything
second
spy
we
watch
majesty
and
we
search
out
majesty
we
read
shadows
and
we
read
footprints
and
whispers
in
secret
places
but
we
do
not
read
writing
king
the
see
what
it
is
chamberlain
up
and
it
is
treason
majesty
king
read
it
chamberlain
i
saw
a
purple
bird
go
up
against
the

and
it
went
up
and
up
and
round
about
did
fly
i
saw
it
die
first

the

have
spoken
king
the
has
anyone
been
here

the
stranger
from
thessaly
sentry
as
nobody
majesty
king
you
saw

but
a
dog
far
out
upon
the
plain
and
the
children
of
the
guard
at
play
king
the
second
and
you
second
sentry
nothing
majesty
chamberlain
that
is
strange
king
it
is
some
secret
warning
chamberlain
it
is
treason
king
it
is
from
the
stars
chamberlain
no
no
majesty
not
from
the
stars
not
from
the
stars
some
man
has
done
it
yet
the
thing
should
be
interpreted
shall
i
send
for
the
prophets
of
the
stars
king
beckons
to
his
spies
they
run
up
to
king
find
me
some
prophet
of
the
stars
i
fear
that
we
may
go
no
more
my
chamberlain
along
the
winding
ways
of
unequalled
zericon
nor
play
dahoori
with
the
golden
balls
i
have
thought
more
of
my
people
than
of
the
stars
and
more
of
zericon
than
of
windy
heaven
chamberlain
believe
me
majesty
some
idle
man
has
written
it
and
passed
by
your
spies
shall
find
him
and
then
his
name
will
be
soon
forgotten
king
yes
yes
perhaps
you
are
right
though
the
sentries
saw
no
one
no
doubt
some
beggar
did
it
chamberlain
yes
majesty
some
beggar
has
surely
done
it
but
look
here
come
two
prophets
of
the
stars
they
shall
tell
us
that
this
is
idle
two
prophets
and
a
boy
attending
them
all
bow
deeply
to
the
king
the
two
spies
steal
in
again
and
stand
at
king
some
beggar
has
written
a
rhyme
on
the
iron
gate
and
as
the
ways
of
rhyme
are
known
to
you
i
desired
you
rather
as
poets
than
as
prophets
to
say
whether
there
was
any
meaning
in
it
chamberlain
but
an
idle
rhyme
first
prophet
again
and
goes
up
to
door
he
glances
at
the
come
hither
servant
of
those
that
serve
the
stars
first
prophet
bring
hither
our
golden
cloaks
for
this
may
be
a
matter
for
rejoicing
and
bring
our
green
cloaks
also
for
this
may
tell
of
young
new
beautiful
things
with
which
the
stars
will
one
day
gladden
the
king
and
bring
our
black
cloaks
also
for
it
may
be
a
doom
the
boy
the
prophet
goes
up
to
the
door
and
reads
the
stars
have
spoken
attendant
with
king
i
tell
you
that
some
beggar
has
written
this
first
prophet
it
is
written
in
pure
gold
dons
the
black
cloak
over
body
and
king
what
do
the
stars
mean
what
warning
is
it
first
prophet
i
can
not
say
king
second
come
you
then
and
tell
us
what
the
warning
is
second
prophet
up
to
the
door
and
the
stars
have
spoken
cloaks
himself
in
king
what
is
it
what
does
it
mean
second
prophet
we
do
not
know
but
it
is
from
the
stars
chamberlain
it
is
a
harmless
thing
there
is
no
harm
in
it
majesty
why
should
not
birds
die
king
why
have
the
prophets
covered
themselves
in
black
chamberlain
they
are
a
secret
people
and
look
for
inner
meanings
there
is
no
harm
in
it
king
they
have
covered
themselves
in
black
chamberlain
they
have
not
spoken
of
any
evil
thing
they
have
not
spoken
of
it
king
if
the
people
see
the
prophets
covered
in
black
they
will
say
that
the
stars
are
against
me
and
believe
that
my
luck
has
turned
chamberlain
the
people
must
not
know
king
some
prophet
must
interpret
to
us
the
doom
let
the
chief
prophet
of
the
stars
be
sent
for
chamberlain
toward
left
summon
the
chief

will
put
a
necklace
of
turquoises
round
his
neck
with
opals
from

mines

he
will
not
fail
he
is
a
very
cunning
interpreter
king
what
if
he
covers
himself
with
a
huge
black
cloak
and
does
not
speak
and
goes
muttering
away
slowly
with
bended
head
till
our
fear
spreads
to
the
sentries
and
they
cry
aloud
chamberlain
this
is
no
doom
from
the
stars
but
some
idle
scribe
hath
written
it
in
his
insolence
upon
the
iron
door
wasting
his
hoard
of
gold
king
not
for
myself
i
have
a
fear
of
doom
not
for
myself
but
i
inherited
a
rocky
land
windy
and
and
nursed
it
to
prosperity
by
years
of
peace
and
spread
its
boundaries
by
years
of
war
i
have
brought
up
harvests
out
of
barren
acres
and
given
good
laws
unto
naughty
towns
and
my
people
are
happy
and
lo
the
stars
are
angry
chamberlain
it
is
not
the
stars
it
is
not
the
stars
majesty
for
the
prophets
of
the
stars
have
not
interpreted
it
indeed
it
was
only
some
reveller
wasting
his
gold
enter
chief
prophet
of
the
stars
that
look
on
king
chief
prophet
of
the
stars
that
look
on
zericon
i
would
have
you
interpret
the
rhyme
upon
yonder
door
chief
prophet
up
to
the
door
and
it
is
from
the
stars
king
interpret
it
and
you
shall
have
great
turquoises
round
your
neck
with
opals
from
the
mines
in
the
frozen
mountains
chief
prophet
himself
like
the
others
in
a
great
black
who
should
wear
purple
in
the
land
but
a
king
or
who
go
up
against
the
sky
but
he
who
has
troubled
the
stars
by
neglecting
their
ancient
worship
such
a
one
has
gone
up
and
up
increasing
power
and
wealth
such
a
one
has
soared
above
the
crowns
of
those
that
went
before
him
such
a
one
the
stars
have
doomed
the
undying
ones
the
illustrious
king
who
wrote
it
chief
prophet
it
is
pure
gold
some
god
has
written
it
chamberlain
some
god
chief
prophet
some
god
whose
home
is
among
the
undying
stars
first
sentry
to
the
second
last
night
i
saw
a
star
go
flaming
earthward
king
is
this
a
warning
or
is
it
a
doom
chief
prophet
the
stars
have
spoken
king
it
is
then
a
doom
chief
prophet
they
speak
not
in
jest
king
i
have
been
a
great
king
let
it
be
said
of
me
the
stars
overthrew
him
and
they
sent
a
god
for
his
doom
for
i
have
not
met
my
equal
among
kings
that
man
should
overthrow
me
and
i
have
not
oppressed
my
people
that
man
should
rise
up
against
me
chief
prophet
it
is
better
to
give
worship
to
the
stars
than
to
do
good
to
man
it
is
better
to
be
humble
before
the
gods
than
proud
in
the
face
of
your
enemy
though
he
do
evil
king
let
the
stars
hearken
yet
and
i
will
sacrifice
a
child
to
them
i
will
sacrifice
a
girl
child
to
the
twinkling
stars
and
a
male
child
to
the
stars
that
blink
not
the
stars
of
the
steadfast
eyes
his
let
a
boy
and
girl
be
brought
for
sacrifice
a
spy
to
the
right
looking
at
will
you
accept
this
sacrifice
to
the
god
that
the
stars
have
sent
they
say
that
the
gods
love
children
chief
prophet
i
may
refuse
no
sacrifice
to
the
stars
nor
to
the
gods
whom
they
send
the
other
make
ready
the
sacrificial
knives
prophets
draw
knives
and
sharpen
king
is
it
fitting
that
the
sacrifice
take
place
by
the
iron
door
where
the
god
from
the
stars
has
trod
or
must
it
be
in
the
temple
chief
prophet
let
it
be
offered
by
the
iron
door
the
other
fetch
hither
the
altar
stone
whistle
is
heard
off
right
the
third
spy
runs
crouching
toward
it
king
will
this
sacrifice
avail
to
avert
the
doom
chief
prophet
who
knows
king
i
fear
that
even
yet
the
doom
will
fall
chief
prophet
it
were
wise
to
sacrifice
some
greater
thing
king
what
more
can
a
man
offer
chief
prophet
his
pride
king
what
pride
chief
prophet
your
pride
that
went
up
against
the
sky
and
troubled
the
stars
king
how
shall
i
sacrifice
my
pride
to
the
stars
chief
prophet
it
is
upon
your
pride
that
the
doom
will
fall
and
will
take
away
your
crown
and
will
take
away
your
kingdom
king
i
will
sacrifice
my
crown
and
reign
uncrowned
amongst
you
so
only
i
save
my
kingdom
chief
prophet
if
you
sacrifice
your
crown
which
is
your
pride
and
if
the
stars
accept
it
perhaps
the
god
that
they
sent
may
avert
the
doom
and
you
may
still
reign
in
your
kingdom
though
humbled
and
uncrowned
king
shall
i
burn
my
crown
with
spices
and
with
incense
or
cast
it
into
the
sea
chief
prophet
let
it
be
laid
here
by
the
iron
door
where
the
god
came
who
wrote
the
golden
doom
when
he
comes
again
by
night
to
shrivel
up
the
city
or
to
pour
an
enemy
in
through
the
iron
door
he
will
see
your
pride
and
perhaps
accept
it
and
take
it
away
to
the
neglected

king
the
go
after
my

that
i
make

bowed
ragged
and
dirty
gnawing
a
bone
he
has
uncouth
hair
and
a
dishevelled
beard
a
battered
spade
lies
near
him
two
or
three
slaves
sit
at
back
of
stage
eating
raw
the
the
chant
of
the
rises
at
intervals
monotonous
and
mournful
coming
from
distant
king
argimenes
this
is
a
good
bone
there
is
juice
in
this
bone
zarb
i
wish
i
were
you
argimenes
king
argimenes
i
am
not
to
be
envied
any
longer
i
have
eaten
up
my
bone
zarb
i
wish
i
were
you
because
you
have
been
a
king
because
men
have
prostrated
themselves
before
your
feet
because
you
have
ridden
a
horse
and
worn
a
crown
and
have
been
called
majesty
king
argimenes
when
i
remember
that
i
have
been
a
king
it
is
very
terrible
zarb
but
you
are
lucky
to
have
such
things
in
your
memory
as
you
have
i
have
nothing
in
my
memory
once
i
went
for
a
year
without
being
flogged
and
i
remember
my
cleverness
in
contriving
it
i
have
nothing
else
to
remember
king
argimenes
it
is
very
terrible
to
have
been
a
king
zarb
but
we
have
nothing
who
have
no
good
memories
in
the
past
it
is
not
easy
for
us
to
hope
for
the
future
here
king
argimenes
have
you
any
god
zarb
we
may
not
have
a
god
because
he
might
make
us
brave
and
we
might
kill
our
guards
he
might
make
a
miracle
and
give
us
swords
king
argimenes
ah
you
have
no
hope
then
zarb
i
have
a
little
hope
hush
and
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
the
great
dog
is
ill
and
like
to
die
they
will
throw
him
to
us
we
shall
have
beautiful
bones
then
king
argimenes
ah
bones
zarb
yes
that
is
what
hope
for
and
have
no
other
hope
do
you
not
hope
that
your
nation
will
arise
some
day
and
rescue
you
and
cast
off
the
king
and
hang
him
up
by
his
thumbs
from
the
palace
gateway
king
argimenes
no
i
have
no
other
hope
for
my
god
was
cast
down
in
the
temple
and
broken
into
three
pieces
on
the
day
that
they
surprised
us
and
took
me
sleeping
but
will
they
throw
him
to
us
will
so
honorable
a
brute
as
the
king
dog
be
thrown
to
us
zarb
when
he
is
dead
his
honors
are
taken
away
even
the
king
when
he
is
dead
is
given
to
the
worms
then
why
should
not
his
dog
be
thrown
to
us
king
argimenes
we
are
not
worms
zarb
you
do
not
understand
argimenes
the
worms
are
little
and
free
while
we
are
big
and
enslaved
i
did
not
say
we
were
worms
but
we
are
worms
and
if
they
have
the
king
when
he
is
dead
why
then
king
argimenes
tell
me
more
of
the
king
dog
are
there
big
bones
on
him
zarb
ay
he
is
a
big
dog
a
high
big
black
one
king
argimenes
you
know
him
then
zarb
oh
yes
i
know
him
i
know
him
well
i
was
beaten
once
because
of
him
strokes
from
the
treble
whips
two
men
beating
me
king
argimenes
how
did
they
beat
you
because
of
the
king
dog
zarb
they
beat
me
because
i
spoke
to
him
without
making
obeisance
he
was
coming
dancing
along
over
the
and
i
spoke
to
him
he
was
a
friendly
great
dog
and
i
spoke
to
him
and
patted
his
head
and
did
not
make
obeisance
king
argimenes
and
they
saw
you
do
it
zarb
yes
the
saw
me
they
came
and
seized
me
at
once
and
bound
my
arms
the
great
dog
wanted
me
to
speak
to
him
again
but
i
was
hurried
away
king
argimenes
you
should
have
made
obeisance
zarb
the
great
dog
seemed
so
friendly
that
i
forgot
he
was
the
king
great
dog
king
argimenes
but
tell
me
more
was
he
hurt
or
is
it
a
sickness
zarb
they
say
that
it
is
a
sickness
king
argimenes
ah
then
he
will
grow
thin
if
he
does
not
die
soon
if
it
had
been
a
hurt
but
we
should
not
complain
i
complain
more
often
than
you
do
because
i
had
not
learned
to
submit
while
i
was
yet
young
zarb
if
your
beautiful
memories
do
not
please
you
you
should
hope
more
i
wish
i
had
your
memories
i
should
not
trouble
to
hope
then
it
is
very
hard
to
hope
king
argimenes
there
will
be
nothing
more
to
hope
for
when
we
have
eaten
the
dog
zarb
why
you
might
find
gold
in
the
earth
while
you
were
digging
then
you
might
bribe
the
commander
of
the
guard
to
lend
you
his
sword
we
would
all
follow
you
if
you
had
a
sword
then
we
might
take
the
king
and
bind
him
and
lay
him
on
the
ground
and
fasten
his
tongue
outside
his
mouth
with
thorns
and
put
honey
on
it
and
sprinkle
honey
near
then
the
gray
ants
would
come
from
one
of
their
big
mounds
my
father
found
gold
once
when
he
was
digging
king
argimenes
did
your
father
free
himself
zarb
no
because
the
king
overseer
found
him
looking
at
the
gold
and
killed
him
but
he
would
have
freed
himself
if
he
could
have
bribed
the
guard
prophet
walks
across
the
stage
attended
by
two
slaves
he
is
going
to
the
king
he
is
going
to
the
king
zarb
he
is
going
to
the
king
king
argimenes
going
to
prophesy
good
things
to
the
king
it
is
easy
to
prophesy
good
things
to
a
king
and
be
rewarded
when
the
good
things
come
what
else
should
come
to
a
king
a
prophet
a
prophet
deep
bell
tolls
slowly
king
argimenes
and
zarb
pick
up
their
spades
at
once
and
the
old
slaves
at
the
back
of
the
stage
go
down
on
their
knees
immediately
and
grub
in
the
soil
with
their
hands
the
white
beard
of
the
oldest
trails
in
the
dirt
as
he
works
king
argimenes
king
argimenes
what
is
the
name
of
that
song
that
we
always
sing
i
like
the
song
zarb
it
has
no
name
it
is
our
song
there
is
no
other
song
king
argimenes
once
there
were
other
songs
has
this
no
name
zarb
i
think
the
soldiers
have
a
name
for
it
king
argimenes
what
do
the
soldiers
call
it
zarb
the
soldiers
call
it
the
the
chant
of
the
king
argimenes
it
is
a
good
song
i
could
sing
no
other
now
moves
away
king
argimenes
himself
as
his
spade
touches
something
in
the
metal
with
his
spade
gold
perhaps
it
is
of
no
use
here
earth
leisurely
suddenly
he
drops
on
his
knees
and
works
excitedly
in
the
earth
with
his
hands
then
very
slowly
still
kneeling
he
lifts
lying
flat
on
his
hands
a
long
greenish
sword
his
eyes
intent
on
it
about
the
level
of
his
uplifted
forehead
he
holds
it
still
flat
on
both
hands
and
addresses
it
o
holy
and
blessed
thing
he
lowers
it
slowly
till
his
hands
rest
on
his
knees
and
looking
all
the
while
at
the
sword
three
years
ago
king
darniak
spat
at
me
having
taken
my
kingdom
from
me
three
times
in
that
year
i
was
flogged
with
twelve
stripes
with
seventeen
stripes
and
with
twenty
stripes
a
year
and
eleven
months
ago
come
the
king
overseer
struck
me
in
the
face
and
nine
times
in
that
year
he
called
me
dog
for
one
month
two
weeks
and
a
day
i
was
yoked
with
a
bullock
and
pulled
a
rounded
stone
all
day
over
the
paths
except
while
we
were
fed
i
was
flogged
twice
that
year
with
eighteen
stripes
and
with
ten
stripes
this
year
the
roof
of
the
has
fallen
in
and
king
darniak
will
not
repair
it
five
weeks
ago
one
of
his
queens
laughed
at
me
as
she
came
across
the
i
was
flogged
again
this
year
and
with
thirteen
stripes
and
twelve
times
they
have
called
me
dog
and
these
things
they
have
done
to
a
king
and
a
king
of
the
house
of
ithara
listens
attentively
for
a
moment
then
buries
the
sword
again
and
pats
the
earth
over
it
with
his
hands
then
digs
old
slaves
do
not
see
him
their
faces
are
to
the
earth
enter
the
king
overseer
carrying
a
whip
the
slaves
and
king
argimenes
kneel
with
their
foreheads
to
the
ground
as
he
passes
across
the
stage
exit
the
king
king
argimenes
hands
outspread
o
warrior
spirit
wherever
thou
wanderest
whoever
be
thy
gods
whether
they
punish
thee
or
whether
they
bless
thee
o
kingly
spirit
that
once
laid
here
this
sword
behold
i
pray
to
thee
having
no
gods
to
pray
to
for
the
god
of
my
nation
was
broken
in
three
by
night
mine
arm
is
stiff
with
three
years
slavery
and
remembers
not
the
sword
but
guide
thy
sword
till
i
have
slain
six
men
and
armed
the
strongest
slaves
and
thou
shalt
have
the
sacrifice
every
year
of
a
hundred
goodly
oxen
and
i
will
build
in
ithara
a
temple
to
thy
memory
wherein
all
that
enter
in
shall
remember
thee
so
shalt
thou
be
honored
and
envied
among
the
dead
for
the
dead
are
very
jealous
of
remembrance
ay
though
thou
wert
a
robber
that
took
men
lives
unrighteously
yet
shall
rare
spices
smoulder
in
thy
temple
and
little
maidens
sing
and
flowers
deck
the
solemn
aisles
and
priests
shall
go
about
it
ringing
bells
that
thy
soul
shall
find
repose
oh
but
it
has
a
good
blade
this
old
green
sword
thou
wouldst
not
like
to
see
it
miss
its
mark
if
the
dead
see
at
all
as
wise
men
teach
thou
wouldst
not
like
to
see
it
go
thirsting
into
the
air
so
huge
a
sword
should
find
its
marrowy
bone
his
right
hand
come
into
my
right
arm
o
ancient
spirit
o
unknown
warrior
soul
and
if
thou
hast
the
ear
of
any
gods
speak
there
against
illuriel
god
of
king
darniak
rises
and
goes
on
the
king
overseer
so
you
have
been
praying
king
argimenes
no
master
the
king
overseer
the
saw
you
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
slave
to
pray
king
argimenes
i
did
but
pray
to
illuriel
to
make
me
a
good
slave
to
teach
me
to
dig
well
and
to
pull
the
rounded
stone
and
to
make
me
not
to
die
when
the
food
is
scarce
but
to
be
a
good
slave
to
my
master
the
great
king
the
king
overseer
who
art
thou
to
pray
to
illuriel
dogs
may
not
pray
to
an
immortal
god
comes
back
king
argimenes
zarb
zarb
do
not
look
at
me
when
you
speak
the
guards
are
watching
us
look
at
your
digging
king
argimenes
how
do
the
guards
know
we
are
speaking
because
we
look
at
one
another
zarb
you
are
very
witless
of
course
they
know
king
argimenes
zarb
zarb
what
is
it
king
argimenes
how
many
guards
are
there
in
sight
zarb
there
are
six
of
them
over
there
they
are
watching
us
king
argimenes
are
there
other
guards
in
sight
of
these
six
guards
zarb
no
king
argimenes
how
do
you
know
zarb
because
whenever
their
officer
leaves
them
they
sit
upon
the
ground
and
play
with
dice
king
argimenes
how
does
that
show
that
there
are
not
another
six
in
sight
of
them
zarb
how
witless
you
are
argimenes
of
course
it
shows
there
are
not
because
if
there
were
another
officer
would
see
them
and
their
thumbs
would
be
cut
off
king
argimenes
ah
zarb
would
the
slaves
follow
me
if
i
tried
to
kill
the
guards
zarb
no
argimenes
king
argimenes
why
would
they
not
follow
me
zarb
because
you
look
like
a
slave
they
will
never
follow
a
slave
because
they
are
slaves
themselves
and
know
how
mean
a
creature
is
a
slave
if
you
looked
like
a
king
they
would
follow
you
king
argimenes
but
i
am
a
king
they
know
that
i
am
a
king
zarb
it
is
better
to
look
like
a
king
it
is
looks
that
they
would
go
by
king
argimenes
if
i
had
a
sword
would
they
follow
me
a
beautiful
huge
sword
of
bronze
zarb
i
wish
i
could
think
of
things
like
that
it
is
because
you
were
once
a
king
that
you
can
think
of
a
sword
of
bronze
i
tried
to
hope
once
that
i
should
some
day
fight
the
guards
but
i
could
picture
a
sword
i
could
imagine
it
i
could
only
picture
whips
king
argimenes
dig
a
little
nearer
zarb
both
edge
i
have
found
a
very
old
sword
in
the
earth
it
is
not
a
sword
such
as
common
soldiers
wear
a
king
must
have
worn
it
and
an
angry
king
it
must
have
done
fearful
things
there
are
little
dints
in
it
perhaps
there
was
a
battle
here
long
ago
where
all
were
slain
and
perhaps
that
king
died
last
and
buried
his
sword
but
the
great
birds
swallowed
him
zarb
you
have
been
thinking
too
much
of
the
king
dog
argimenes
and
that
has
made
you
hungry
and
hunger
has
driven
you
mad
king
argimenes
i
found
such
a
sword
zarb
why
then
you
will
wear
a
purple
cloak
again
and
sit
on
a
great
throne
and
ride
a
prancing
horse
and
we
shall
call
you
majesty
king
argimenes
i
shall
break
a
long
fast
first
and
drink
much
water
and
sleep
but
will
the
slaves
follow
me
zarb
you
will
them
follow
you
if
you
have
a
sword
yet
is
illuriel
a
very
potent
god
they
say
that
none
have
prevailed
against
king
darniak
dynasty
so
long
as
illuriel
stood
once
an
enemy
cast
illuriel
into
the
river
and
overthrew
the
dynasty
but
a
fisherman
found
him
again
and
set
him
up
and
the
enemy
was
driven
out
and
the
dynasty
returned
king
argimenes
if
illuriel
could
be
cast
down
as
my
god
was
cast
down
perhaps
king
darniak
could
be
overcome
as
i
was
overcome
in
my
sleep
zarb
if
illuriel
were
cast
down
all
the
people
would
utter
a
cry
and
flee
away
it
would
be
a
fearful
portent
king
argimenes
how
many
men
are
there
in
the
armory
at
the
palace
zarb
there
are
ten
men
in
the
palace
armory
when
all
the
are
out
dig
awhile
in
zarb
the
officer
of
the
has
gone
away
they
are
playing
with
dice
now
throws
down
his
spade
and
stretches
his
the
man
with
the
big
beard
has
won
again
he
is
very
nimble
with
his
thumbs
they
are
playing
again
but
it
is
getting
dark
i
can
not
clearly
see
argimenes
furtively
uncovers
the
sword
he
picks
it
up
and
grips
it
in
his
zarb
majesty
argimenes
crouches
and
steals
away
towards
the
zarb
the
other
argimenes
has
found
a
terrible
sword
and
has
gone
to
slay
the
it
is
not
a
common
sword
it
is
some
king
sword
an
old
slave
argimenes
will
be
dreadfully
flogged
we
shall
hear
him
cry
all
night
his
cries
will
frighten
us
and
we
shall
not
sleep
zarb
no
no
the
guards
flog
poor
slaves
but
argimenes
had
an
angry
look
the
guards
will
be
afraid
when
they
see
him
look
so
angry
and
see
his
terrible
sword
it
was
a
huge
sword
and
he
looked
very
angry
he
will
bring
us
the
swords
of
the
we
must
prostrate
ourselves
before
him
and
kiss
his
feet
or
he
will
be
angry
with
us
too
old
slave
will
argimenes
give
me
a
sword
zarb
he
will
have
swords
for
six
of
us

he
slays

yes
he
will
give
you
a
sword
slave

and
the

grow
idle
they
even
become
insolent
and

queen
cahafra
the
king
then
why
are
they
not
flogged
queen
it

so
simple
they
have
to

but
these
people

so
silly

unto

the

at
once
in
a
loud
there
was
once
a
king
that
had
slaves
to
hate
him
and
to
toil
for
him
and
he
had
soldiers
to
guard
him

to
die
for
him
and
the
number
of
the
slaves
that
he
had
to

for

was
greater
than
the
number
of
the
soldiers
that
he
had
to
guard
him
and
to
die
for
him
and
the
days
of
that
king
were
few
and
the
number
of
thy
slaves
o
king
that
thou
hast
to
hate
thee
is
greater
than
the
number
of
thy
soldiers
queen
cahafra
queen
and
i
wore
the
crown
with
the
sapphires
and
the
big
emerald
in

prince
said

very
sweet

him
stop
speaking
when

see
the

nod
graciously
they
applaud
the

by
idly
clapping
their
third
queen
do
ask
him
to
make
us
another
prophecy

he
is
so
interesting
he
looks
so
clever
the

prophesy
unto
us
the

thine
armies
camped
upon
thy
mountainous
borders
descry
no
enemy
in
the
plains
afar
and
within
thy
gates
lurks
he
for
whom
thy
sentinels
seek
upon
lonely
guarded
frontiers
there
is
a
fear
upon
me
and
a
boding
even
yet
there
is
time
even
yet
but
time
and
my
mind
is
dark
with
trouble
for
thy
kingdom
queen
cahafra
queen
i
do
not
like
the
way
he
does
his
hair
queen
thragolind
it
would
be
all
right
if
he
would
only
have
it
cut
the
king
the
prophet
dismissing
him
with
a
nod
of
the
thank
you
that
has
been
very
interesting
queen
thragolind
how
clever
he
is
i
wonder
how
he
thinks
of
things
like
that
queen
cahafra
yes
but
i
hate
a
man
who
is
conceited
about
it
look
how
he
wears
his
hair
queen
thragolind
yes
of
course
it
is
perfectly
dreadful
queen
cahafra
why
ca
he
wear
his
hair
like
other
people
even
if
he
does
say
clever
things
queen
thragolind
yes
i
hate
a
conceited
man

cottage
roof
the
day
before

orchards
full
of
apples
as
far
as
you
can
see
and
the
rivers
of
tigris
and
euphrates

the
bible
says
and

city
of
gold
for

care
for
cities

full
of
precious
stones

a
bit
tired
of
cities

the
orchards
are
by
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates

should
be
surprised
if
my
old
mother
was
there

never
cared

way
i
earned
my
livelihood
but
she
was
a
good
mother
to
me

do
know
if
they
want
a
good
mother
in
there
who
would
be
kind
to
the
angels
and
sit
and
smile
at
them
when
they
sang
and
soothe
them
if
they
were
cross

the
good
ones
in

be
there
all
right

they
wo
have
brought
me
up
against
her

glass
of
beer
to

know
when
to
expect
me

anywhere

the
window
at
any
hour
and
she
always
knew

i
should
be
immensely
obliged
to
you
if

a
very
great
favor
i
have
unfortunately
left
my
hat
behind
while
calling
at
this
house
it
is
half
under
the
long
sofa
at
the
far
end
if
you
could
possibly
be
so
kind
as
to
pretend
you
have
come
to
tune
the
piano
and
fetch
my
hat
for
me
i
should
be
enormously
grateful
to
you
poet
but
why
can
not
you
get
it
for
yourself
caller
i
can
not
poet
if
you
would
tell
me
the
reason
perhaps
i
could
help
you
caller
i
can
not
i
can
never
enter
that
house
again
poet
if
you
have
committed
a
murder
by
all
means
tell
me
i
am
not
sufficiently
interested
in
ethics
to
wish
to
have
you
hanged
for
it
caller
do
i
look
like
a
murderer
poet
no
of
course
not
i
am
only
saying
that
you
can
safely
trust
me
for
not
only
does
the
statute
book
and
its
penalties
rather
tend
to
bore
me
but
murder
itself
has
always
had
a
certain
fascination
for
me
i
write
delicate
and
fastidious
lyrics
yet
strange
as
it
may
appear
i
read
every
murder
trial
and
my
sympathies
are
always
with
the
prisoner
caller
but
i
tell
you
i
am
not
a
murderer
poet
then
what
have
you
done
caller
i
have
quarrelled
with
a
lady
in
that
house
and
have
sworn
to
join
the
bosnians
and
die
in
africa
poet
but
this
is
beautiful
caller
unfortunately
i
forgot
my
hat
poet
you
go
to
die
for
a
hopeless
love
and
in
a
far
country
it
was
the
wont
of
the
troubadours
caller
but
you
will
get
my
hat
for
me
poet
that
i
will
gladly
do
for
you
but
we
must
find
an
adequate
reason
for
entering
the
house
caller
you
pretend
to
tune
the
piano
poet
that
unfortunately
is
impossible
the
sound
of
a
piano
being
unskilfully
handled
is
to
me
what
the
continual
drop
of
cold
water
on
the
same
part
of
the
head
is
said
to
be
in
countries
where
that
interesting
torture
is
practised
there
is
caller
but
what
are
we
to
do
poet
there
is
a
house
where
kind
friends
of
mine
have
given
me
that
security
and
comfort
that
are
a
poet
necessity
but
there
was
a
governess
there
and
a
piano
it
is
years
and
years
since
i
was
able
even
to
see
the
faces
of
those
friends
without
an
inward
shudder
caller
well
we
have
to
think
of
something
else
poet
you
are
bringing
back
to
these
unhappy
days
the
romance
of
an
age
of
which
the
ballads
tell
us
that
kings
sometimes
fought
in
no
other
armor
than
their
lady
nightshirt
caller
yes
but
you
know
first
of
all
i
must
get
my
poet
but
why
caller
i
can
not
possibly
be
seen
in
the
streets
without
a
hat
poet
why
not
caller
it
ca
be
done
poet
but
you
confuse
externals
with
essentials
caller
i
do
know
what
you
call
essentials
but
being
decently
dressed
in
london
seems
pretty
essential
to
me
poet
a
hat
is
not
one
of
the
essential
things
of
life
caller
i
do
want
to
appear
rude
but
my
hat
is
quite
like
yours
poet
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
of
things
that
matter
things
that
will
be
remembered
after
a
hundred
years
regarded
in
this
light
one
sees
at
once
the
triviality
of
hats
but
to
die
and
die
beautifully
for
a
hopeless
love
that
is
a
thing
one
could
make
a
lyric
about
that
is
the
test
of
essential
things
try
and
imagine
them
in
a
lyric
one
could
not
write
a
lyric
about
a
hat
caller
i
do
care
whether
you
could
write
a
lyric
about
my
hat
or
whether
you
could
all
i
know
is
that
i
am
not
going
to
make
myself
absolutely
ridiculous
by
walking
about
in
london
without
a
hat
will
you
get
it
for
me
or
will
you
not
poet
to
take
any
part
in
the
tuning
of
a
piano
is
impossible
to
me
caller
well
pretend
you
come
to
look
at
the
radiator
they
have
one
under
the
window
and
i
happen
to
know
it
leaks
poet
i
suppose
it
has
an
artistic
decoration
on
it
caller
yes
i
think
so
poet
then
i
decline
to
look
at
it
or
to
go
near
it
i
know
these
decorations
in
cast
iron
i
once
saw
a
egyptian
god
named
bes
and
he
was
to
be
ugly
but
he
was
as
ugly
as
these
decorations
that
the
twentieth
century
can
make
with
machinery
what
has
a
plumber
got
to
do
with
art
that
he
should
dare
to
attempt
decoration
caller
then
you
wo
help
me
poet
i
wo
look
at
ugly
things
and
i
wo
listen
to
ugly
noises
but
if
you
can
think
of
any
reasonable
plan
i
do
mind
helping
you
caller
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
you
do
look
like
a
plumber
or
a
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
i
have
had
a
terrible
ordeal
and
i
am
not
in
the
condition
to
think
calmly
poet
then
you
will
have
to
leave
your
hat
to
its
altered
destiny
caller
why
ca
you
think
of
a
plan
if
you
a
poet
thinking
rather
in
your
line
poet
if
i
could
bring
my
thoughts
to
contemplate
so
absurd
a
thing
as
a
hat
for
any
length
of
time
no
doubt
i
could
think
of
a
plan
but
the
very
triviality
of
the
theme
seems
to
scare
them
away
caller
then
i
must
get
it
myself
poet
for
heaven
sake
do
do
that
think
what
it
means
caller
i
know
it
will
seem
absurd
but
not
so
absurd
as
walking
through
london
without
it
poet
i
do
mean
that
but
you
will
make
it
up
you
will
forgive
each
other
and
you
will
marry
her
and
have
a
family
of
noisy
pimply
children
like
everyone
else
and
romance
will
be
dead
no
do
ring
that
bell
go
and
buy
a
bayonet
or
whatever
one
does
buy
and
join
the
bosnians
caller
i
tell
you
i
ca
without
a
hat
poet
what
is
a
hat
will
you
sacrifice
for
it
a
beautiful
doom
think
of
your
bones
neglected
and
forgotten
lying
forlornly
because
of
hopeless
love
on
endless
golden
sands
lying
forlorn
as
keats
said
what
a
word
forlorn
in
africa
the
careless
bedouins
going
past
by
day
at
night
the
lion
roar
the
grievous
voice
of
the
desert
caller
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
think
you
right
in
speaking
of
it
as
desert
the
bosnians
i
believe
are
only
taking
it
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
most
fertile
land
in
the
world
poet
what
of
that
you
will
not
be
remembered
by
geography
and
statistics
but
by
romance
and
that
is
how
romance
sees
africa
caller
well
i
going
to
get
my
hat
poet
think
think
if
you
enter
by
that
door
you
will
never
fall
among
the
foremost
bosnians
you
will
never
die
in
a
lonely
land
to
lie
by
immense
sahara
and
she
will
never
weep
for
your
beautiful
doom
and
call
herself
cruel
in
vain
caller
hark
she
is
playing
the
piano
it
seems
to
me
that
she
might
be
unhappy
about
it
for
years
i
do
see
much
good
in
that
poet
no
will
comfort
her
caller
i
damned
if
you
do
look
here
i
do
mind
saying
i
damned
if
you
do
poet
calm
yourself
calm
yourself
i
do
not
mean
in
that
way
caller
then
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
poet
i
will
make
songs
about
your
beautiful
death
glad
songs
and
sad
songs
they
shall
be
glad
because
they
tell
again
the
noble
tradition
of
the
troubadours
and
sad
because
they
tell
of
your
sorrowful
destiny
and
of
your
hopeless
love
i
shall
make
legends
also
about
your
lonely
bones
telling
perhaps
how
some
arabian
men
finding
them
in
the
desert
by
some
oasis
memorable
in
war
wonder
who
loved
them
and
then
as
i
read
them
to
her
she
weeps
perhaps
a
little
and
i
read
instead
of
the
glory
of
the
soldier
how
it
overtops
our
transitory
caller
look
here
i
not
aware
that
you
ever
been
introduced
to
her
poet
a
trifle
a
trifle
caller
it
seems
to
me
that
you
in
rather
an
undue
hurry
for
me
to
get
a
jubu
spear
in
me
but
i
going
to
get
my
hat

poet
i
appeal
to
you
i
appeal
to
you
in
the
name
of
beautiful
battles
high
deeds
and
lost
causes
in
the
name
of
told
to
cruel
maidens
and
told
in
vain
in
the
name
of
stricken
hearts
broken
like
beautiful
i
appeal
to
you
i
appeal
in
the
ancient
holy
name
of
romance

ring
that
rings
the
poet
down
you
will
marry
you
will
sometimes
take
a
ticket
with
your
wife
as
far
as
paris
perhaps
as
far
as
cannes
then
the
family
will
come
a
large
sprawling
family
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
i
speak
in
hyperbole

earn
money
and
feed
it
and
be
like
all

be
set
up
to
your
memory
