a
word
of
explanation
have
not
attempted
in
this
book
to
write
an
autobiography
this
is
not
my
story
it
is
the
story
of
the
people
the
pioneers
who
settled
on
that
part
of
the
public
lands
called
the
great
american
desert
and
wrested
a
living
from
it
at
a
personal
cost
of
privation
and
there
is
an
infinite
deal
of
talk
about
dust
bowls
of
prairie
grass
which
should
never
have
been
plowed
under
for
farming
of
land
which
should
be
abandoned
yet
much
of
this
is
the
land
which
during
the
crucial
years
of
the
war
was
the
section
of
the
united
states
regiments
of
men
have
marched
to
war
with
drums
beating
and
flags
flying
but
the
regiments
who
marched
into
the
desert
and
faced
fire
and
thirst
and
cold
and
hunger
and
who
stayed
to
build
up
a
new
section
of
the
country
a
huge
empire
in
the
west
have
been
ignored
and
their
problems
largely
history
of
the
homesteaders
is
paradoxical
beginning
as
it
does
in
the
spirit
of
a
great
gamble
with
the
government
lotteries
with
land
as
the
stakes
and
developing
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
own
part
in
so
tremendous
a
migration
of
a
people
was
naturally
a
slight
one
but
for
me
it
has
been
a
rewarding
adventure
leading
men
and
women
onto
the
land
then
against
organized
interests
and
finally
into
the
widespread
use
of
cooperative
methods
most
of
that
story
belongs
beyond
the
confines
of
the
present
thousands
of
acres
today
in
the
west
men
and
women
are
still
fighting
to
control
that
last
frontier
and
wherever
there
are
farmers
the
methods
of
cooperation
will
spread
for
decades
it
is
a
good
fight
i
hope
i
shall
be
in
land

a
shack
on
the
prairie
at
sunset
we
came
up
out
of
the
draw
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
perched
on
the
high
seat
of
the
old
spring
wagon
we
looked
into
a
desolate
land
which
reached
to
the
horizon
on
every
side
prairie
which
had
lain
untouched
since
the
creation
save
for
buffalo
and
roving
bands
of
indians
its
brown
grass
scorched
and
crackling
from
the
sun
no
trees
to
break
the
endless
monotony
or
to
provide
a
moment
respite
from
the
sun
the
driver
sitting
stooped
over
on
the
front
seat
half
asleep
straightened
up
and
looked
around
sizing
up
the
vacant
prairie
well
he
announced
i
reckon
this
might
be
it
but
this
could
be
it
there
was
nothing
but
space
and
plains
and
the
sun
blazing
down
on
our
heads
my
sister
pulled
out
the
filing
papers
looking
for
the
description
the
united
states
land
office
had
given
her
section
range
about
thirty
miles
from
pierre
south
dakota
three
miles
from
the
buffalo
waller
our
driver
said
mumbling
to
himself
ignoring
the
official
location
and
looking
back
as
though
measuring
the
distance
with
his
eye
yeah
right
in
here
somewhere
but
faltered
ida
mary
there
was
to
be
a
house
thar
she
is
he
announced
pointing
his
long
whip
in
the
direction
of
the
setting
sun
see
that
shack
over
yonder
whipping
up
the
tired
team
with
a
flick
of
the
rawhide
he
angled
off
across
the
trackless
prairie
one
look
at
the
black
shack
standing
alone
in
that
barren
expanse
and
the
last
spark
of
our
dwindling
enthusiasm
for
homesteading
was
snuffed
out
the
house
which
had
seemed
such
an
extraordinary
stroke
of
luck
when
we
had
heard
of
it
looked
like
a
large
but
none
too
substantial
tossed
haphazardly
on
the
prairie
which
crept
in
at
its
very
door
the
driver
stopped
the
team
in
front
of
the
shack
threw
the
lines
to
the
ground
stretched
his
long
lank
frame
over
the
wheel
and
began
to
unload
the
baggage
he
pushed
open
the
unbolted
door
with
the
grass
grown
up
to
the
very
sill
and
set
the
boxes
and
trunk
inside
grass
dry
yellow
grass
crackling
under
his
feet
here
why
do
you
get
out
he
said
sharply
it
sundown
and
a
long
trip
back
to
town
automatically
we
obeyed
as
ida
mary
paid
him
the
fee
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
sizing
us
up
homesteaders
were
all
in
his
work
they
came
some
stayed
to
prove
up
the
land
some
did
we
would
do
to
me
like
you
gals
are
big
enough
to
homestead
he
took
his
own
filled
water
jug
from
the
wagon
and
set
it
down
at
the
door
thus
expressing
his
compassion
then
as
unconcerned
as
a
taxi
driver
leaving
his
passengers
at
a
city
door
he
drove
away
leaving
us
alone
ida
mary
and
i
fought
down
the
impulse
to
run
after
him
implore
him
to
take
us
back
with
him
not
to
leave
us
alone
with
the
prairie
and
the
night
with
nothing
but
the
for
shelter
i
think
we
were
too
overwhelmed
by
the
magnitude
of
our
disaster
even
to
ask
for
help
we
stared
after
him
until
the
sudden
evening
chill
which
comes
with
the
dusk
of
the
frontier
roused
us
to
action
hesitantly
we
stepped
over
the
low
sill
of
the
little
shack
feeling
like
intruders
ida
mary
who
had
been
so
proud
of
finding
a
claim
with
a
house
already
built
stared
at
it
without
a
word
her
round
young
face
shadowed
by
the
brim
of
her
straw
hat
drawn
and
tired
it
was
a
typical
homestead
shack
about
feet
containing
only
one
room
and
built
of
rough
boards
with
a
small
cellar
window
on
either
side
of
the
room
like
the
walls
the
door
was
of
wide
boards
the
whole
house
was
covered
on
the
outside
with
tar
paper
it
had
obviously
been
put
together
with
small
concern
for
the
fine
points
of
carpentry
and
none
whatever
for
appearance
it
looked
as
though
the
first
wind
would
pick
it
up
and
send
it
flying
through
the
air
it
was
as
unprepossessing
within
as
it
was
outside
in
one
corner
a
homemade
bunk
was
fastened
to
the
wall
with
ropes
and
run
through
holes
in
the
inch
pieces
of
lumber
which
formed
the
bed
to
take
the
place
of
springs
in
another
corner
a
rusty
oil
stove
stood
on
a
drygoods
box
above
it
another
box
with
a
shelf
in
it
for
a
cupboard
two
rickety
homemade
chairs
completed
the
furnishings
we
tried
to
tell
ourselves
that
we
were
lucky
shacks
were
not
provided
for
homesteaders
they
had
to
build
their
own
but
ida
mary
had
succeeded
in
finding
one
not
only
ready
built
but
furnished
as
well
we
did
not
deceive
ourselves
or
each
other
we
were
frightened
and
homesick
whatever
we
had
pictured
in
our
imaginations
it
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
shack
without
creature
comforts
nor
had
we
counted
on
the
desolation
of
prairie
on
which
we
were
marooned
before
darkness
should
shut
us
in
we
hurriedly
scrambled
through
our
provisions
for
a
can
of
kerosene
down
in
the
trunk
was
a
small
lamp
we
got
it
out
and
filled
it
and
then
we
faced
each
other
speechless
each
knowing
the
other
fear
afraid
to
voice
it
matches
they
had
not
been
on
our
list
i
fumbled
hastily
through
the
old
box
cupboard
with
its
few
odds
and
ends
back
in
a
corner
was
an
old
tobacco
can
something
rattled
lightly
as
i
picked
it
up
matches
we
were
too
weary
to
light
a
fire
on
a
trunk
which
we
used
as
a
table
we
spread
a
cold
lunch
tried
to
swallow
a
few
bites
and
gave
it
up
the
empty
space
and
the
black
night
had
swallowed
us
up
we
might
as
well
go
to
bed
said
ida
mary
dully
we
start
back
home
in
the
morning
i
declared
as
soon
as
it
is
daylight
oddly
enough
we
had
never
questioned
the
impulse
which
led
two
young
city
girls
to
go
alone
into
unsettled
land
homesteading
our
people
had
been
pioneers
always
among
those
who
pushed
back
the
frontier
the
ammonses
had
come
up
from
tennessee
into
illinois
in
the
early
days
and
cleared
the
timberland
along
the
mississippi
valley
some
forty
miles
out
of
louis
they
built
their
houses
of
the
logs
and
became
land
and
stock
owners
they
were
not
sturdy
pioneers
but
they
were
tenacious
some
of
them
went
on
into
what
grandma
ammons
called
the
santa
fe
bottoms
a
low
marshy
country
along
the
river
where
they
became
wealthy
or
at
least
by
fattening
droves
of
hogs
on
acorns
generally
speaking
my
mother
family
ran
to
professions
and
my
father
family
to
land
though
there
was
father
cousin
jack
hunter
who
had
been
west
and
when
he
came
to
visit
us
now
and
then
told
wild
tales
about
the
frontier
to
which
my
sister
and
i
as
little
children
listened
he
wove
glowing
accounts
of
the
range
country
where
he
was
going
to
make
a
million
dollars
raising
cattle
cousin
jack
always
talked
big
it
was
from
his
highly
colored
yarns
that
we
had
learned
all
we
knew
of
the
west
and
from
the
western
magazines
which
pictured
it
as
an
exciting
place
where
people
were
mostly
engaged
in
shooting
one
another
while
ida
mary
and
i
were
still
very
young
our
mother
died
and
after
that
we
divided
our
time
between
our
father
home
he
had
married
again
and
had
a
second
family
to
take
care
of
and
the
home
of
his
sister
as
a
result
my
sister
and
i
came
to
depend
on
ourselves
and
on
each
other
more
than
two
girls
of
our
age
usually
do
by
the
time
we
were
old
enough
to
see
that
things
were
not
going
well
financially
at
home
we
knew
we
must
make
our
own
way
some
of
the
girls
we
knew
talked
about
going
homesteading
as
a
wild
adventure
they
boasted
of
friends
or
relatives
who
had
gone
to
live
on
a
claim
as
though
they
had
gone
in
africa
or
in
alaska
a
homestead
at
first
thought
the
idea
was
absurd
we
were
both
very
young
both
unusually
slight
anything
but
hardy
pioneers
and
neither
of
us
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
homesteading
conditions
or
experience
extending
beyond
the
conventional
sheltered
life
of
the
normal
city
girl
in
the
first
decade
of
the
century
we
were
wholly
unfitted
for
the
frontier
we
had
neither
training
nor
physical
stamina
for
roughing
it
when
i
tried
to
explain
to
an
uncle
of
mine
that
i
wanted
to
go
west
to
make
something
of
myself
he
retorted
that
it
was
a
hell
of
a
place
to
do
it
in
spite
of
the
discussion
which
our
decision
occasioned
we
made
our
plans
deciding
to
risk
the
hazards
of
a
raw
country
alone
cutting
ourselves
off
from
the
world
of
everyone
and
everything
we
had
ever
known
and
with
little
money
to
provide
against
hardships
and
emergencies
at
that
time
the
country
was
emerging
from
the
era
of
straggling
settlers
immigration
was
moving
west
in
a
steady
stream
the
tidal
wave
which
swept
the
west
from
to
the
world
war
was
almost
upon
us
although
we
could
not
see
it
then
but
we
thought
there
would
be
new
people
new
interests
and
in
the
end
acres
of
land
for
ida
mary
perhaps
for
me
the
health
i
had
sought
so
unsuccessfully
primarily
a
of
land
was
the
reason
for
almost
everyone
coming
west
as
people
in
the
early
pioneer
days
had
talked
of
settling
in
nebraska
and
kansas
and
the
eastern
dakotas
they
now
talked
about
the
country
lying
farther
on
the
western
dakotas
wyoming
montana
colorado
over
the
midwest
the
homestead
idea
was
spreading
rapidly
to
farm
and
hamlet
and
city
one
heard
a
great
deal
about
families
leaving
their
farms
and
going
west
to
get
cheap
land
of
young
college
men
who
went
out
to
prove
up
a
the
land
would
always
be
worth
something
and
the
experience
even
for
a
short
time
was
a
fruitful
one
in
many
ways
to
the
public
however
not
so
romantically
inclined
the
homesteaders
were
the
peasantry
of
america
through
the
early
homesteading
days
folk
who
picked
up
and
set
themselves
down
to
grub
on
a
piece
of
land
were
not
of
the
world
or
important
to
it
but
the
stream
of
immigration
to
the
land
was
widening
flowing
steadily
on
how
did
one
go
about
homesteading
we
asked
well
all
you
had
to
do
to
get
a
deed
to
a
acres
of
land
was
to
file
on
it
at
the
nearest
land
office
live
on
it
eight
months
pay
the
government
an
acre
and
the
land
was
yours
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
the
only
improvement
required
by
the
government
was
some
sort
of
abode
as
proof
that
one
had
made
the
land
his
residence
for
the
full
eight
months
what
would
that
cost
and
the
whole
undertaking
it
depended
partly
on
what
kind
of
shack
one
built
and
whether
he
did
it
himself
or
hired
it
done
a
shack
cost
all
the
way
from
to
or
more
some
of
those
who
had
families
and
intended
to
stay
built
cheap
houses
of
course
it
cost
women
who
had
to
hire
things
done
more
to
homestead
but
with
grub
fuel
and
other
necessities
we
figured
it
would
cost
not
more
than
all
told
then
we
learned
of
this
with
a
shack
already
built
bunk
and
all
it
had
been
filed
on
and
the
owner
had
left
before
time
so
that
the
claim
shack
and
all
had
reverted
to
the
government
we
had
about
saved
up
and
this
was
enough
we
decided
to
cover
homesteading
expenses
inasmuch
as
the
shack
was
provided
so
we
had
all
but
the
final
payment
of
to
the
government
which
would
be
due
when
we
had
made
proof
we
decided
to
let
the
money
for
that
final
payment
take
care
of
itself
the
thing
to
do
was
to
get
hold
of
a
piece
of
land
before
it
was
all
gone
to
hear
people
talk
it
was
the
last
day
of
grace
to
apply
for
a
claim
they
talked
like
that
for
ten
years
we
did
not
know
there
were
several
million
acres
lying
out
there
between
the
missouri
and
the
pacific
waiting
to
be
settled
we
would
have
all
winter
to
figure
out
how
to
prove
up
and
we
found
that
one
could
get
to
for
a
raw
claim
after
getting
a
deed
to
it
the
claim
with
the
shack
on
it
was
in
south
dakota
thirty
miles
from
a
town
called
pierre
we
looked
that
up
in
the
geography
to
make
sure
it
really
existed
but
when
we
tried
to
get
detailed
information
facts
and
figures
to
help
us
prepare
for
what
was
to
come
we
got
only
printed
pamphlets
of
rules
and
regulations
which
were
of
no
real
help
at
all
land
offices
were
so
busy
in
those
days
that
all
they
could
do
was
to
send
out
a
package
of
printed
information
that
no
one
could
understand
armed
with
our
meager
array
of
facts
we
talked
to
our
father
as
though
the
information
we
gave
him
so
glibly
had
any
real
bearing
on
this
precarious
undertaking
of
his
two
young
daughters
whatever
his
doubts
and
hesitations
he
let
us
decide
for
ourselves
it
was
only
when
we
boarded
the
old
bald
eagle
at
louis
one
summer
day
in
bound
up
the
river
that
he
clung
to
our
hands
as
though
unable
to
let
us
go
saying
i
afraid
you
are
making
a
mistake
take
care
of
yourselves
it
will
be
all
right
ida
mary
told
him
cheerfully
it
is
only
for
eight
months
nothing
can
happen
in
eight
months
the
first
emergency
arose
almost
at
once
we
started
up
the
mississippi
in
high
spirits
but
by
the
time
we
reached
moline
illinois
i
was
taken
from
the
boat
on
a
stretcher
the
aftermath
of
typhoid
fever
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
ill
it
was
worse
to
have
an
unexpected
drain
on
our
funds
but
worst
of
all
was
the
fear
that
someone
might
file
on
the
claim
ahead
of
us
for
a
week
or
ten
days
i
could
not
travel
but
ida
mary
went
ahead
to
attend
to
the
and
the
buying
of
supplies
so
that
we
could
start
for
the
homestead
as
soon
as
i
arrived
the
trip
from
moline
to
pierre
i
made
by
train
ida
mary
was
at
the
depot
to
meet
me
and
at
once
we
took
a
ferry
across
the
river
to
pierre
the
river
was
low
and
the
sandbars
rose
up
to
meet
the
skiffs
pierre
was
a
typical
frontier
town
unkempt
and
unfinished
its
business
buildings
hotel
and
stores
none
of
more
than
two
stories
on
the
wide
dirt
road
called
main
street
at
one
end
of
main
street
flowed
the
old
missouri
at
the
other
it
branched
off
into
trails
that
lost
themselves
in
the
prairie
beyond
main
street
the
houses
of
the
little
town
were
scattered
looking
raw
and
new
and
uncomfortable
most
of
them
with
small
sunburned
stunted
gardens
but
there
was
nothing
apologetic
about
pierre
we
done
mighty
well
with
what
we
had
to
work
with
was
its
attitude
section
range
about
thirty
miles
from
pierre
it
seemed
more
real
now
the
hotel
proprietor
promised
to
find
us
a
claim
locator
to
whom
that
cryptic
number
made
sense
the
next
morning
at
we
were
on
our
way
at
that
hour
the
little
homestead
town
of
pierre
lay
quiet
other
homesteaders
were
ready
to
start
out
a
farmer
and
his
wife
from
wisconsin
who
were
busy
sandwiching
their
four
children
into
a
wagon
already
filled
with
immigrant
goods
a
cow
and
horse
tied
on
behind
at
a
long
table
in
the
hotel
dining
room
we
ate
flapjacks
and
fried
potatoes
and
drank
strong
coffee
in
big
heavy
cups
then
at
long
last
perched
on
the
seat
of
the
claim
locator
high
spring
wagon
we
jolted
out
of
town
swerving
to
let
a
stagecoach
loaded
with
passengers
whip
past
us
waiting
while
a
team
of
buffalo
ambled
past
and
finally
jogged
along
the
beaten
road
through
the
bad
lands
outside
of
town
beyond
the
rough
bad
lands
we
came
upon
the
prairie
we
traveled
for
miles
along
a
narrow
rutted
road
crossed
now
and
then
by
dim
trails
leading
nowhere
it
seemed
our
own
road
dwindled
to
a
rough
trail
and
the
spring
wagon
lurched
over
it
while
we
clung
to
the
sides
to
ease
the
constant
jolting
letting
go
to
pull
our
hats
over
our
eyes
which
ached
with
the
glare
or
over
the
back
of
our
necks
which
were
blistered
from
the
sun
our
frantic
haste
to
arrive
while
the
land
lasted
seemed
absurd
now
there
was
land
enough
for
all
who
wanted
it
and
few
enough
to
claim
it
all
that
weary
day
we
saw
no
people
save
in
the
distance
a
few
homesteaders
mowing
strips
of
the
short
dry
grass
for
hay
now
and
then
we
passed
a
few
head
of
horses
and
a
cow
grazing
here
and
there
over
the
hot
dusty
plain
we
saw
shacks
and
makeshift
houses
surrounded
by
patches
of
corn
or
flax
or
garden
why
were
the
houses
so
scattered
looking
as
though
they
had
been
thrown
down
at
random
they
had
to
be
set
on
the
claims
our
locator
said
dryly
about
noon
we
stopped
at
a
deserted
ranch
house
surrounded
by
corrals
a
camp
our
driver
explained
where
some
stockman
held
his
cattle
overnight
in
driving
them
to
market
here
we
ate
a
lunch
and
the
locator
fed
and
watered
the
team
refilling
the
jars
from
an
old
well
with
its
long
wooden
water
troughs
there
the
trail
ended
now
we
struck
out
over
a
trackless
land
that
grew
rougher
the
farther
we
went
to
look
for
a
here
was
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
it
was
late
summer
and
the
sun
beat
down
on
the
hot
prairie
grass
and
upon
our
heads
we
had
driven
all
day
without
sign
of
shade
and
save
for
that
brief
interval
at
noon
without
sight
of
water
our
faces
and
hands
were
blistered
our
throats
parched
from
the
hot
wind
this
was
not
the
west
as
i
had
dreamed
of
it
not
the
west
even
of
banditry
and
violent
action
it
was
a
desolate
forgotten
land
without
vegetation
save
for
the
dry
crackling
grass
without
visible
tokens
of
fertility
drab
and
gray
and
empty
stubborn
resisting
land
heroics
would
count
for
much
here
it
would
take
slow
labor
and
time
and
the
action
of
the
seasons
to
make
the
prairie
bloom
people
had
said
this
was
no
place
for
two
girls
it
began
to
seem
that
they
were
right
and
this
was
the
goal
of
our
long
journey
the
shack
we
pushed
the
trunk
over
in
front
of
the
door
which
had
no
lock
piled
the
chairs
and
suitcases
on
top
of
the
trunk
spread
a
comfort
over
the
rope
bed
and
threw
ourselves
across
it
without
undressing
we
had
no
gun
or
other
weapon
for
protection
and
were
not
brave
enough
to
use
one
had
we
possessed
it
the
little
cellar
windows
which
stood
halfway
between
the
low
ceiling
and
the
floor
were
nailed
shut
but
we
needed
neither
window
nor
door
so
far
as
air
was
concerned
it
poured
through
the
wide
cracks
like
water
through
a
sieve
while
we
tossed
too
tired
and
sick
at
heart
to
sleep
i
asked
what
became
of
the
young
man
who
built
this
shack
he
lived
here
only
a
few
weeks
and
abandoned
it
ida
mary
explained
the
claim
reverted
to
the
government
shack
bunk
and
all
he
stick
it
out
the
next
morning
we
awoke
to
a
world
flooded
with
sunshine
and
it
was
the
surprise
of
our
lives
that
we
had
lived
to
see
it
ida
started
the
oil
stove
and
put
on
the
coffee
wearily
i
dragged
myself
out
of
bed
we
fried
bacon
made
toast
unpacked
our
few
dishes
discovering
that
a
hinged
shelf
on
the
wall
was
intended
for
a
table
we
put
it
up
and
set
our
breakfast
on
it
we
found
that
we
were
really
hungry
our
determination
to
start
back
home
was
still
unshaken
but
we
had
reckoned
without
the
prairies
we
were
marooned
as
on
a
desert
island
and
more
pressing
even
than
some
way
of
getting
back
to
pierre
and
home
was
the
need
for
water
we
must
get
a
jug
of
water
somewhere
water
did
come
from
a
tap
on
the
prairies
we
began
to
wonder
where
it
did
come
from
certainly
there
was
a
drop
to
be
found
on
ida
mary
claim
in
the
glaring
morning
sun
which
blazed
on
the
earth
we
saw
a
shack
in
the
distance
the
reflection
of
the
sun
on
yellow
boards
it
was
farther
away
than
it
appeared
to
be
with
the
bright
light
against
it
this
new
home
was
larger
than
the
regulation
shack
and
it
had
a
gable
a
roof
which
in
itself
was
a
symbol
of
permanence
in
contrast
to
the
temporary
huts
that
dotted
the
plains
it
was
made
of
which
did
away
with
the
need
of
tar
paper
and
in
the
homestead
country
marked
a
man
prestige
and
solidity
we
were
met
at
the
open
door
by
a
pretty
plump
young
woman
a
little
girl
of
seven
stood
quietly
at
one
side
and
a
little
boy
perhaps
five
at
the
other
as
we
stood
there
with
the
jug
she
broke
into
a
pleasant
laugh
you
come
for
water
we
have
no
well
but
huey
hauled
two
barrels
this
morning
from
crooks
several
miles
away
we
were
led
into
a
large
room
clean
and
cool
after
one
has
been
in
a
low
shack
that
becomes
an
oven
when
the
sun
shines
on
it
entering
a
house
with
a
gable
is
almost
like
going
into
a
refrigerator
there
was
much
in
the
room
except
beds
and
a
sewing
machine
the
floor
on
which
a
smaller
child
was
playing
was
bare
except
for
a
few
rag
rugs
but
shining
an
opening
led
into
a
small
kitchen
with
a
range
in
one
corner
in
the
other
a
large
square
table
spread
with
a
checked
tablecloth
was
set
ready
for
the
next
meal
and
covered
with
a
mosquito
bar
the
home
the
family
gave
one
a
feeling
of
coming
to
anchor
in
a
sea
of
grass
and
sky
we
learned
that
the
name
was
dunn
and
that
they
were
dirt
farmers
from
iowa
but
they
had
not
come
in
time
to
do
much
farming
that
season
they
had
thrown
up
a
makeshift
barn
as
a
temporary
shelter
for
the
horses
and
one
cow
until
they
could
build
a
real
barn
after
they
found
out
what
the
soil
would
do
dunn
explained
she
hurried
out
to
the
kitchen
talking
as
she
moved
about
and
came
in
with
coffee
and
a
plate
of
oatmeal
cookies
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
live
here
she
told
us
neighbors
within
a
mile
and
a
half
i
wo
feel
so
much
alone
with
neighbors
close
by
to
chat
with
we
had
the
courage
to
tell
her
that
we
were
going
to
stay
you
must
have
found
the
shack
dirty
she
said
with
a
glance
at
her
spotless
house
a
bachelor
homesteader
had
it
and
they
are
always
the
worst
they
wait
until
the
floor
is
thick
with
dirt
and
grease
and
then
spread
newspapers
over
it
to
cover
up
the
dirt
you
have
a
time
getting
it
fixed
as
you
want
it
we
wondered
how
anyone
made
a
home
of
a
shack
to
hear
dunn
casual
remarks
one
would
think
it
no
more
of
a
problem
than
redecorating
a
city
home
as
we
started
on
the
trek
back
she
called
after
us
huey
will
haul
you
over
a
keg
of
water
tomorrow
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
earshot
i
said
we
can
hire
dunn
to
take
us
back
to
pierre
that
an
idea
ida
mary
agreed
by
the
time
we
had
walked
back
the
mile
and
a
half
which
seemed
five
in
the
scorching
heat
it
was
past
noon
and
we
were
completely
exhausted
so
we
did
not
get
started
back
to
pierre
that
day
but
we
felt
a
little
easier
there
was
a
way
to
get
out
illustration
ii
down
to
grass
roots
there
is
a
lot
of
sound
common
sense
in
the
saying
about
leaving
the
cage
door
open
as
long
as
we
knew
we
could
be
taken
back
to
town
we
were
content
to
stay
for
a
day
or
two
and
take
a
look
at
the
country
while
we
were
there
by
which
we
meant
that
we
would
gaze
out
over
the
empty
spaces
with
a
little
more
interest
we
strained
our
eyes
for
sight
of
moving
objects
for
signs
of
life
once
we
saw
a
team
and
wagon
moving
toward
the
south
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
it
dropped
out
of
sight
into
a
ravine
a
horseman
crossing
the
plains
faded
into
the
horizon
as
our
vision
gradually
adjusted
itself
to
distance
we
saw
other
homestead
abodes
the
eye
picked
up
these
little
shacks
across
the
plains
one
by
one
for
years
straggling
settlers
had
moved
on
and
off
the
prairie
and
those
who
stayed
barely
made
a
mark
on
the
engulfing
spaces
the
unyielding
harsh
life
had
routed
the
majority
of
homesteaders
they
had
shut
the
door
behind
them
and
left
the
land
to
its
own
all
over
the
plains
empty
shacks
told
the
tale
they
stood
there
with
the
grass
grown
up
around
them
the
unwritten
inscription
this
has
been
taken
dilapidated
the
tiny
window
or
two
boarded
up
boards
cracked
or
fallen
apart
they
too
had
not
been
able
to
weather
the
hard
forces
of
nature
on
the
frontier
if
the
shack
had
gone
down
or
had
been
moved
in
the
night
by
some
more
ambitious
homesteader
there
was
always
the
pile
of
tin
cans
to
mark
the
spot
they
stayed
and
rusted
and
from
the
tin
cans
ye
knew
them
bachelors
huts
were
always
surrounded
where
there
was
a
woman
to
do
the
cooking
there
were
fewer
cans
but
as
a
rule
the
shack
dwellers
lived
out
of
tin
cans
like
city
apartment
dwellers
but
for
the
most
part
the
land
was
inhabited
by
coyotes
and
prairie
dogs
with
a
few
herds
of
range
sheep
and
cattle
few
of
the
homesteaders
were
permanent
they
stayed
their
eight
months
if
they
could
stick
it
out
and
left
at
once
their
uneasy
stay
on
the
land
was
like
the
brief
pause
of
migratory
birds
or
the
haphazard
drifting
of
tumble
weeds
that
go
rolling
across
the
plains
before
the
wind
landing
against
a
fence
or
any
other
object
that
blocked
their
way
the
empty
shacks
reminded
one
of
the
phantom
towns
which
men
had
thrown
up
breathlessly
and
abandoned
when
the
search
for
gold
had
proved
illusory
only
permanency
could
dig
the
gold
of
fertility
from
the
prairie
and
thus
far
the
people
who
had
made
a
brief
attempt
to
cope
with
it
had
been
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
those
abandoned
had
defeated
the
men
who
would
have
taken
them
the
main
movement
over
the
plains
was
that
of
hauling
water
from
the
few
wells
in
the
country
or
from
one
of
two
narrow
creeks
that
twisted
through
the
parched
land
and
vanished
into
dry
gulches
they
were
now
as
dry
as
a
bone
i
have
a
well
huey
dunn
said
if
i
could
stop
hauling
water
long
enough
to
dig
one
that
was
the
situation
of
most
of
the
homesteaders
most
of
these
migratory
homesteaders
wanted
the
land
as
an
investment
to
own
it
and
sell
it
to
some
eastern
farmer
or
to
a
rancher
some
like
huey
dunn
came
to
make
a
permanent
home
and
till
the
land
these
few
dirt
farmers
raised
patches
of
corn
and
while
the
farmers
from
iowa
and
illinois
were
scornful
of
the
miniature
stalks
the
flavor
of
the
sweet
corn
grown
on
the
dry
sod
was
unsurpassed
the
few
patches
of
potatoes
were
sweet
and
mealy
but
the
perfect
sod
crop
was
flax
already
the
frontier
was
becoming
known
for
its
flax
raising
we
saw
no
large
range
herds
though
there
were
no
herd
laws
to
keep
them
off
private
property
one
could
drive
straight
as
the
crow
flies
from
pierre
to
presho
forty
or
fifty
miles
without
stopping
to
open
a
gate
if
one
struck
a
fence
around
a
here
or
there
he
either
got
out
and
cut
the
wire
in
two
or
drove
around
the
corner
of
the
fence
depending
upon
how
he
felt
about
fences
being
in
the
way
no
wonder
went
crazy
we
thought
swallowed
up
by
that
sea
of
brown
dry
grass
by
the
endless
monotony
of
space
i
think
what
struck
us
most
those
first
days
was
the
realization
that
the
era
of
pioneers
had
not
ended
with
covered
wagon
days
that
there
were
men
and
women
thousands
of
them
in
our
own
times
living
under
pioneer
conditions
fighting
the
same
hardships
the
same
obstacles
the
same
primitive
surroundings
which
had
beset
that
earlier
generation
toward
evening
that
first
day
sitting
on
the
little
board
platform
in
front
of
the
door
where
there
was
a
hint
of
shade
and
a
suggestion
of
coolness
in
the
air
we
saw
two
animals
approaching
i
never
saw
dogs
like
that
did
you
i
said
to
ida
mary
when
they
came
a
little
closer
she
jumped
up
crying
wolves
we
had
seen
one
on
the
road
out
from
pierre
we
ran
into
the
shack
nailed
the
door
shut
that
night
no
risking
of
trunks
or
boxes
against
it
crawled
into
bed
and
lay
there
for
hours
afraid
to
speak
out
loud
huey
dunn
came
next
day
with
the
keg
of
water
wolves
he
said
as
we
told
him
of
the
experience
they
would
hurt
anyone
unless
they
were
cornered
or
hungry
but
how
demanded
ida
mary
were
we
to
tell
when
they
were
hungry
huey
laughed
at
that
when
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
ground
for
a
long
time
after
a
blizzard
and
there
was
no
way
to
get
food
they
sometimes
attacked
sheep
or
cattle
and
they
had
been
known
to
attack
persons
but
not
often
they
generally
went
in
packs
to
do
their
foraging
goin
back
tomorrow
dunn
ejaculated
as
we
interrupted
his
talk
about
the
country
to
ask
him
to
take
us
to
pierre
why
my
wife
planned
on
your
comin
over
to
dinner
tomorrow
but
if
we
wanted
to
go
the
next
day
sure
he
could
take
us
oh
he
would
charge
us
much
as
he
drove
away
he
called
back
do
get
scared
when
you
hear
the
coyotes
get
used
to
if
you
stay
and
that
night
they
howled
we
were
awakened
by
the
eerie
cry
that
traveled
so
far
over
the
open
prairie
and
seemed
so
near
a
wild
desolate
cry
with
an
uncannily
human
quality
that
mournful
sound
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
prairie
as
is
the
wind
which
blows
unchecked
over
the
vast
stretches
the
dreary
inescapable
voice
of
the
plains
the
first
time
we
heard
the
coyotes
there
seemed
to
be
a
hundred
of
them
though
there
were
probably
half
a
dozen
all
huey
dunn
assurance
that
they
were
harmless
and
that
it
was
a
nightly
occurrence
failed
to
calm
us
when
huey
got
home
his
wife
asked
what
he
thought
of
their
new
neighbors
right
nice
girls
to
talk
to
huey
said
but
damn
poor
homesteaders
beats
the
devil
the
kind
of
people
that
are
taking
up
land
develop
a
country
with
landowners
like
that
those
girls
want
to
go
home
already
i
said
you
wanted
to
come
over
to
dinner
tomorrow
noon
maybe
you
can
fix
up
something
kinda
special
i
drop
a
few
extra
spuds
into
the
pot
and
bake
a
pan
of
cornbread
they
eat
it
dunn
predicted
cheerfully
she
was
right
bringing
us
back
to
the
claim
the
next
afternoon
huey
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
promised
a
neighbor
to
help
string
the
following
day
but
sure
he
could
take
us
to
town
any
day
after
that
the
next
day
we
began
to
discover
the
women
who
were
living
on
homesteads
and
who
in
their
own
way
played
so
vital
a
part
in
developing
the
west
one
of
our
nearest
neighbors
by
straining
our
eyes
we
could
see
her
little
shack
perched
up
against
the
horizon
put
on
her
starched
calico
dress
and
gingham
apron
and
came
right
over
to
call
the
widow
fergus
she
said
she
was
she
sat
down
laid
her
big
straw
hat
on
the
floor
beside
her
no
just
let
it
lie
there
she
always
threw
it
off
like
that
and
made
herself
comfortable
her
graying
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
done
up
in
a
knot
in
the
back
was
freshly
and
sleekly
combed
she
was
brown
as
a
berry
and
just
the
type
of
woman
to
make
a
good
homesteader
with
calloused
capable
tireless
hands
she
was
round
bustling
and
kind
the
widow
fergus
had
taken
up
a
homestead
with
her
young
son
she
looked
at
the
unopened
baggage
the
dirty
shack
now
that
was
sensible
she
said
to
rest
a
few
days
it
was
so
nice
and
quiet
out
here
homesick
my
no
there
was
no
time
to
get
homesick
too
much
to
do
getting
by
on
a
homestead
women
like
the
widow
fergus
we
were
to
discover
had
no
time
for
or
lamenting
their
rigorous
hard
lives
they
did
not
indeed
think
in
terms
of
and
they
managed
on
the
whole
to
live
rich
satisfying
lives
and
at
the
same
time
to
prepare
the
way
for
easier
pleasanter
lives
for
the
women
who
were
to
follow
them
when
she
left
she
said
now
come
over
girls
and
anything
you
want
let
me
know
a
little
later
that
same
day
we
saw
three
riders
galloping
across
the
plains
headed
straight
for
our
shack
they
stopped
short
swung
off
their
ponies
three
girl
homesteaders
they
rode
astride
wore
plain
shirtwaists
and
divided
skirts
two
of
them
wore
cheap
straw
hats
much
like
those
worn
by
farmers
in
the
fields
everywhere
they
swung
from
their
saddles
as
easily
as
though
they
wore
breeches
and
boots
how
did
you
learn
we
were
here
i
asked
curious
to
know
how
news
could
travel
over
these
outlying
spaces
huey
dunn
told
it
over
at
the
road
ranch
while
i
was
waiting
there
for
the
mail
the
oldest
of
the
girls
explained
so
i
just
rode
around
and
picked
up
the
girls
one
would
think
they
lived
in
the
same
city
block
so
nonchalant
was
she
over
the
but
only
eighteen
miles
she
explained
easily
her
name
was
wilomene
white
she
told
us
and
she
came
from
chicago
she
had
been
out
here
most
of
the
time
for
almost
two
years
what
with
leaves
of
absence
in
the
winter
prolonging
the
term
of
residence
she
was
a
short
plump
woman
whom
we
judged
to
be
in
her
early
thirties
and
she
had
a
sense
of
humor
that
was
an
invaluable
asset
in
a
country
like
that
she
was
an
artist
and
head
of
her
father
household
her
brother
was
a
prominent
surgeon
in
chicago
and
for
several
years
wilomene
besides
being
active
in
club
work
had
been
on
the
board
of
the
presbyterian
hospital
there
when
her
health
failed
from
overwork
and
strenuous
public
activities
her
brother
ordered
a
complete
change
and
plenty
of
pure
fresh
air
so
with
a
little
group
of
acquaintances
she
had
come
west
and
taken
up
a
homestead
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
she
had
found
a
change
and
fresh
air
what
surprised
us
was
that
she
took
such
delight
in
the
country
and
the
pioneer
life
about
her
that
she
no
longer
wanted
to
return
to
her
full
life
in
chicago
the
three
girls
stayed
on
and
on
talking
girl
homesteaders
had
no
reason
for
going
home
days
and
nights
days
of
the
week
and
month
were
all
the
same
to
them
there
were
so
few
places
to
go
and
the
distance
was
so
great
that
it
was
a
custom
to
stay
long
enough
to
make
a
visit
worth
while
the
moon
would
come
up
about
ten
that
night
so
nothing
mattered
afraid
to
ride
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
what
was
there
to
fear
out
here
ida
mary
and
i
still
hesitated
about
going
far
from
the
shack
the
prairie
about
us
was
so
unsettled
so
lacking
in
trees
that
there
were
practically
no
landmarks
for
the
unaccustomed
eye
to
follow
we
became
confused
as
to
direction
and
distance
three
miles
from
the
buffalo
waller
our
locator
had
said
no
trouble
to
locate
your
claim
but
if
we
got
far
enough
away
from
it
we
could
even
find
the
buffalo
waller
even
against
our
will
the
bigness
and
the
peace
of
the
open
spaces
were
bound
to
soak
in
despite
the
isolation
the
hardships
and
the
awful
crudeness
we
could
not
but
respond
to
air
that
was
like
old
wine
as
sparkling
in
the
early
morning
as
mellow
in
the
soft
nights
never
were
moon
and
stars
so
gloriously
bright
it
was
the
thinness
of
the
atmosphere
that
made
them
appear
so
near
the
earth
we
were
told
while
the
middle
of
the
day
was
often
so
hot
we
panted
for
breath
mornings
and
evenings
were
always
gloriously
cool
and
invigorating
and
we
slept
with
the
two
comforters
spread
on
the
rope
bed
we
fell
asleep
and
woke
ravenously
hungry
each
morning
that
first
letter
home
was
a
difficult
task
and
we
found
it
safer
to
stick
to
facts
the
trip
had
been
pleasant
ida
mary
had
filed
on
the
claim
but
to
prepare
for
our
arrival
at
home
we
added
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
if
we
think
it
is
best
we
will
come
home
this
was
eventually
sent
off
after
we
had
discussed
what
we
had
better
tell
our
father
and
crossed
out
the
sentences
that
might
worry
him
waste
so
much
paper
ida
mary
warned
me
it
is
thirty
miles
to
another
writing
tablet
we
were
eating
supper
one
evening
when
four
or
five
coyotes
slipped
up
out
of
the
draw
and
came
close
to
the
shack
almost
one
in
color
with
the
yellow
grass
they
stood
poised
alert
ready
to
run
at
the
slightest
sound
graceful
little
animals
their
pointed
noses
turned
upward
a
great
deal
like
a
collie
dog
we
did
not
make
a
move
but
they
seemed
to
sense
life
in
the
once
deserted
cabin
and
like
a
phantom
they
faded
into
the
night
huey
dunn
was
one
of
those
homesteaders
who
believed
the
world
the
frontier
at
least
was
not
made
in
a
day
he
was
slow
getting
around
to
things
he
never
did
get
around
to
taking
ida
mary
and
me
back
to
pierre
and
to
our
dismay
a
homesteader
drove
up
one
day
with
the
big
box
of
household
goods
we
had
shipped
out
the
stage
express
had
brought
it
out
from
pierre
to
mcclure
and
it
had
been
hauled
the
rest
of
the
way
by
the
first
homesteader
coming
our
way
altogether
it
cost
twenty
dollars
to
get
that
box
and
there
was
ten
dollars
worth
of
stuff
in
it
ida
mary
and
i
had
collected
the
odds
and
ends
it
contained
from
stores
in
louis
selecting
every
article
after
eager
discussion
of
its
future
use
picturing
its
place
in
our
western
cabin
we
had
known
about
the
shack
then
its
arrival
stressed
our
general
disillusionment
we
had
now
seen
the
inside
of
a
few
shacks
over
the
prairie
the
attempts
the
women
had
made
to
convert
them
into
homes
were
pitiful
although
some
of
them
had
really
accomplished
wonders
with
practically
nothing
it
is
pretty
hard
to
crush
the
average
woman
instinct
the
very
grimness
of
the
prairie
increased
their
determination
to
raise
a
bulwark
against
it
up
to
now
we
had
been
uneasy
guests
in
the
shack
ready
for
flight
whenever
huey
dunn
got
around
to
taking
us
back
to
pierre
but
trying
to
dig
out
a
few
things
now
and
then
from
grips
and
trunks
without
unpacking
from
top
to
bottom
is
an
unsatisfactory
procedure
so
we
unpacked
then
we
had
to
find
a
place
for
our
things
and
thought
we
might
as
well
try
to
make
the
cabin
more
comfortable
at
the
same
time
even
if
we
were
staying
we
looked
about
us
there
was
much
to
work
with
in
the
walls
of
our
shack
the
boards
ran
up
and
down
with
a
scantling
midway
between
floor
and
ceiling
running
all
the
way
around
the
room
this
piece
of
lumber
served
two
purposes
it
held
the
shack
together
and
served
as
a
for
everything
from
toilet
articles
to
hammer
and
nails
the
room
had
been
lined
with
patches
of
building
paper
some
red
some
blue
and
finished
out
with
old
newspapers
the
patchwork
lining
had
become
torn
in
long
cracks
where
the
boards
of
the
shack
were
split
and
through
the
holes
the
dry
wind
drove
dust
and
sand
the
shack
would
have
to
be
relined
for
there
was
not
sufficient
protection
from
the
weather
and
we
would
freeze
in
the
first
cold
spell
this
regulation
shack
lining
was
a
great
factor
in
the
settlement
we
should
all
have
frozen
to
death
without
it
it
came
in
rolls
and
was
hauled
out
over
the
plains
like
ammunition
to
an
army
and
paper
factories
boomed
there
were
two
kinds
red
and
blue
and
the
color
indicated
the
grade
the
red
was
a
thinner
inferior
quality
and
cost
about
three
dollars
a
roll
while
the
heavy
blue
cost
six
blue
paper
on
the
walls
was
as
much
a
sign
of
class
on
the
frontier
as
blue
blood
in
boston
we
lined
our
shack
with
red
the
floor
was
full
of
knotholes
and
the
boards
had
shrunk
leaving
wide
cracks
between
the
bachelor
homesteader
had
left
it
black
with
grease
when
huey
hauled
us
an
extra
keg
of
water
we
proceeded
to
take
off
at
least
a
few
layers
we
were
filling
the
cracks
with
putty
when
a
bachelor
homesteader
stopped
by
and
watched
the
operation
in
disgust
where
you
goin
to
run
your
he
wanted
to
know
with
the
cracks
and
knotholes
stopped
up
in
the
box
was
a
faded
brussels
rug
with
a
couple
of
rolls
of
cheap
wallpaper
from
a
homesteader
who
was
proving
up
and
leaving
we
bought
an
old
wire
cot
with
cretonnes
we
made
pillows
stuffed
with
prairie
grass
hung
bright
curtains
at
the
little
windows
which
opened
by
sliding
back
between
strips
of
wood
in
the
big
wooden
box
we
had
also
packed
a
small
light
willow
rocker
in
one
corner
we
nailed
up
a
few
boards
for
a
bookcase
painting
it
bright
red
little
by
little
the
old
shack
took
on
a
homelike
air
it
is
curious
how
much
value
a
thing
has
if
one
has
put
some
effort
into
it
we
were
still
as
disillusioned
with
the
country
as
we
had
been
the
first
day
we
felt
as
out
of
place
on
a
homestead
as
a
coyote
sauntering
up
fifth
avenue
we
felt
the
shack
to
be
the
most
unhomelike
contraption
we
had
ever
seen
but
from
the
moment
we
began
to
make
improvements
transforming
the
shack
it
took
on
an
interest
for
us
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
changes
we
were
able
to
make
slowly
we
were
making
friends
learning
to
find
space
restful
and
reassuring
instead
of
intimidating
adapting
our
restless
natures
to
a
country
that
measured
time
in
seasons
imperceptibly
we
were
putting
down
our
first
roots
into
that
stubborn
soil
at
first
we
read
and
reread
the
letters
from
home
talking
of
it
constantly
and
wistfully
like
exiles
drawn
constantly
toward
the
place
we
had
left
almost
without
our
being
aware
of
it
we
ceased
to
feel
that
we
had
left
louis
it
was
louis
which
was
receding
from
us
while
we
turned
more
and
more
toward
the
new
country
identified
ourselves
with
it
ida
mary
and
i
woke
up
one
day
a
few
weeks
after
our
arrival
to
find
our
grubstake
almost
gone
back
home
we
had
figured
that
there
were
ample
funds
for
filing
fees
for
transportation
and
food
now
we
began
to
figure
backwards
which
we
found
was
a
poor
way
to
figure
there
was
no
money
to
take
us
back
home
we
had
burned
our
bridges
not
only
behind
but
in
front
of
us
it
was
the
incidentals
which
had
cut
into
our
small
reserve
the
expense
of
my
illness
on
the
road
had
been
heavy
the
rest
of
the
money
seemed
to
have
evaporated
like
water
in
dry
air
fixing
up
the
shack
had
been
an
unexpected
expense
and
we
had
overlooked
the
cost
of
hauling
altogether
in
a
country
where
everything
had
to
be
hauled
we
had
paid
for
a
stiff
old
indian
cayuse
the
cheapest
thing
in
horseflesh
that
we
could
find
in
order
to
be
safe
we
had
figured
on
standard
prices
for
commodities
but
we
found
that
all
of
them
were
much
higher
out
here
coal
the
only
fuel
obtainable
ran
as
high
as
a
ton
with
the
hauling
and
high
freight
merchants
blamed
the
freight
cost
for
the
high
price
of
everything
from
coal
to
a
package
of
needles
i
laid
the
blame
for
our
predicament
on
huey
dunn
but
ida
mary
thought
it
went
farther
back
than
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
government
women
should
not
be
allowed
to
file
on
land
regardless
of
where
the
blame
lay
we
were
now
reduced
to
a
state
of
had
not
the
majority
of
the
settlers
taken
this
gambling
chance
of
pulling
through
somehow
the
west
would
never
have
been
settled
it
is
curious
how
quickly
one
animal
instinct
of
survival
comes
to
the
fore
in
primitive
lands
if
we
ran
out
of
bacon
we
stirred
flour
into
a
little
grease
added
water
and
a
few
drops
of
condensed
milk
if
we
had
it
and
turned
out
a
filling
dish
of
gravy
if
we
ran
out
of
coal
we
pulled
the
dried
prairie
grass
to
burn
in
the
little
monkey
stove
which
we
had
bought
with
the
cot
laundry
stoves
some
called
them
to
keep
the
water
from
becoming
warm
as
dishwater
we
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
to
set
the
water
can
in
the
earth
became
so
cool
at
night
that
anything
set
down
in
a
shallow
hole
on
the
shady
side
of
the
house
kept
cool
all
day
we
learned
that
it
took
twice
as
long
to
cook
beans
or
other
vegetables
in
that
high
altitude
that
one
must
put
more
flour
in
the
cake
and
not
so
much
shortening
or
it
would
surely
fall
that
meat
hung
in
the
dry
air
would
keep
fresh
indefinitely
but
we
had
not
tasted
a
bite
of
fresh
meat
since
we
came
our
homestead
not
only
had
a
cabin
but
it
boasted
a
small
patch
of
sweet
corn
planted
by
the
first
filer
on
the
land
it
would
make
food
for
both
man
and
beast
for
the
ammons
girls
and
the
pinto
it
was
a
frontier
saying
that
homesteading
was
a
gamble
yeah
the
united
states
government
is
betting
you
acres
of
land
that
you
live
on
it
eight
months
ida
and
i
were
betting
we
were
holding
on
living
down
to
the
grass
roots
the
big
problem
was
no
longer
how
to
get
off
the
homestead
but
how
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
on
it
if
one
were
in
a
country
where
he
could
live
by
foraging
we
can
live
on
jack
rabbits
next
winter
homesteaders
would
say
but
ida
mary
and
i
would
have
to
depend
on
someone
to
get
them
for
us
we
realized
more
every
day
how
unequipped
we
were
for
plains
life
lacking
the
sturdy
health
of
most
frontier
women
both
of
us
unusually
small
and
slight
back
of
ida
mary
round
youthful
face
and
steady
eyes
however
there
were
grit
and
stamina
and
common
sense
she
would
never
stampede
with
the
herd
and
for
all
my
fragility
i
had
the
will
to
hang
on
well
we
would
eat
corncakes
with
bacon
grease
a
while
longer
they
were
really
good
i
became
an
expert
in
making
them
and
we
still
had
some
bacon
left
and
the
corn
a
little
syrup
in
the
pail
would
take
the
place
of
sugar
uncle
sam
had
won
that
bet
yet
on
the
ammons
homestead
though
most
of
the
settlers
thought
he
would
three
or
four
miles
from
the
claim
was
mcclure
a
ranch
house
combined
with
a
general
store
and
a
post
office
walking
there
one
day
for
groceries
and
our
mail
we
passed
a
group
of
men
lounging
in
front
of
the
old
log
ranch
house
now
such
as
that
wo
ever
be
any
good
to
the
country
one
of
them
said
of
us
what
the
country
needs
is
people
with
guts
there
ought
to
be
a
law
against
women
filing
on
government
land
and
against
all
these
city
folks
coming
out
here
just
to
get
a
deed
and
then
leaving
the
country
added
another
if
they
ai
going
to
improve
the
land
they
ought
to
have
it
most
of
take
their
trunks
along
when
they
go
to
town
to
prove
up
put
in
the
stage
driver
and
that
the
last
you
ever
see
of
they
gone
on
the
next
train
out
landgrabbers
the
native
westerners
called
the
settlers
no
good
to
the
country
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
it
we
began
to
check
up
on
the
homesteaders
of
whom
we
knew
probably
of
them
would
go
back
home
as
soon
as
they
proved
up
leaving
their
shack
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
the
prairie
to
wait
as
it
had
always
waited
for
a
conquering
hand
huey
dunn
and
the
cooks
and
the
wickershams
were
dirt
farmers
come
to
stay
some
of
the
homesteaders
would
come
back
in
the
summertime
putting
out
a
little
patch
of
garden
and
a
few
rows
of
corn
each
season
but
for
the
most
part
there
would
be
no
record
of
these
transient
guests
of
the
prairie
but
abandoned
shacks
those
who
took
up
claims
only
as
an
investment
either
sold
the
land
for
whatever
price
they
could
get
for
it
or
let
it
lie
there
to
increase
in
value
some
of
the
did
object
to
this
system
when
the
land
is
all
taken
up
people
will
have
to
pay
more
for
it
they
explained
but
on
the
whole
they
eyed
with
humorous
intolerance
the
settlers
who
departed
leaving
their
claims
as
they
had
found
them
a
great
blessing
of
the
plains
was
the
absence
of
vermin
i
do
not
remember
having
seen
a
rat
or
a
weasel
on
the
frontier
at
that
time
and
many
of
the
natives
had
never
seen
a
potato
bug
or
chinch
bug
or
cockroach
but
one
day
after
a
short
pelting
rain
i
came
home
and
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
the
moving
crawling
walls
and
could
not
believe
my
eyes
worms
small
brown
slick
worms
an
inch
to
an
inch
and
a
half
long
the
walls
the
door
the
ground
were
alive
with
them
they
were
crawling
through
the
cracks
into
the
shack
wriggling
along
the
floor
and
walls
with
their
tiny
legs
they
infested
the
plains
for
miles
around
at
night
one
could
feel
them
crawling
over
the
bed
the
neighbors
got
together
to
find
means
of
exterminating
these
obnoxious
vermin
we
burned
sulfur
inside
and
used
torches
of
twisted
prairie
hay
on
the
outside
of
the
house
just
near
enough
to
the
walls
to
scorch
the
creepers
but
as
one
regiment
burned
up
another
came
one
day
ida
mary
and
i
in
doing
a
little
research
work
of
our
own
we
had
no
biologists
to
consult
on
plagues
and
no
exterminators
lifted
up
a
wide
board
platform
in
front
of
our
shack
and
ran
screaming
the
pests
were
nested
thick
and
began
to
scatter
rapidly
in
every
direction
a
fermenting
mass
they
were
not
dangerous
they
injured
neither
men
nor
crops
but
they
were
harder
to
endure
than
a
major
disaster
one
was
aware
of
them
everywhere
on
the
chair
one
sat
in
on
the
food
one
ate
on
one
body
they
were
a
crawling
maddening
nightmare
a
number
of
homesteaders
were
preparing
to
leave
the
country
driven
out
by
an
army
of
insects
when
as
suddenly
as
they
came
the
worms
disappeared
where
they
came
from
where
they
went
no
one
knew
i
mention
this
episode
as
one
without
precedent
or
repetition
in
the
history
of
the
frontier
so
far
as
i
know
a
number
of
theories
were
advanced
regarding
this
worm
plague
some
said
they
had
rained
down
in
cell
or
germ
form
others
that
they
had
developed
with
the
sudden
moisture
from
some
peculiar
embryo
in
the
dry
soil
finding
from
my
own
further
observation
that
they
were
segregated
in
the
damper
sections
where
the
soil
had
not
yet
dried
out
after
the
rain
i
concluded
they
had
been
bred
in
the
ground
our
need
for
money
had
become
acute
but
before
we
were
quite
desperate
a
ray
of
hope
appeared
there
were
quite
a
few
children
scattered
over
the
neighborhood
and
the
homesteaders
decided
that
there
must
be
a
school
in
the
center
of
the
district
the
directors
found
that
ida
mary
had
taught
school
a
term
or
two
back
east
and
teachers
were
scarce
as
hens
teeth
out
there
so
she
got
the
school
at
a
month
the
little
schoolhouse
was
built
close
to
the
far
end
of
our
claim
which
was
a
mile
long
instead
of
half
a
mile
square
as
it
should
have
been
we
had
just
finished
breakfast
one
morning
when
huey
dunn
and
another
homesteader
drove
up
to
the
door
with
their
teams
dragging
some
heavy
timbers
along
huey
stood
in
the
door
his
old
straw
hat
in
hand
with
that
placid
expression
on
his
smooth
features
a
man
of
medium
height
shoulders
slightly
rounded
rather
gaunt
in
the
middle
where
the
suspenders
hitched
onto
the
overalls
came
to
move
your
shack
he
said
in
an
offhand
tone
move
it
we
demanded
where
to
the
other
end
of
the
claim
over
by
the
schoolhouse
and
that
as
far
as
i
goin
to
move
you
until
you
prove
up
he
added
he
moved
us
off
the
land
when
we
wanted
to
go
he
would
move
us
up
to
the
line
now
but
not
an
inch
over
it
until
we
had
our
patent
the
men
stuck
the
timbers
under
the
shack
hitched
the
horses
to
it
and
ida
mary
and
i
did
the
housework
en
route
suddenly
she
laughed
if
we
had
been
trying
to
get
huey
dunn
to
move
this
shack
he
would
have
got
to
it
all
winter
when
they
set
us
down
on
the
proper
location
they
tied
the
shack
down
by
driving
stakes
two
or
three
feet
into
the
ground
then
running
wire
cords
like
clothesline
from
the
roof
of
the
shack
down
to
the
stakes
just
luck
there
has
been
much
wind
or
this
drygoods
box
would
have
been
turned
end
over
end
huey
said
was
staked
at
all
it
was
autumn
and
the
air
was
cold
early
in
the
mornings
and
sweet
with
the
smell
of
hay
we
hired
a
homesteader
who
had
a
mower
to
put
up
hay
for
us
and
had
a
frame
made
of
poles
for
a
small
barn
and
stacked
the
hay
on
top
around
it
against
the
winter
most
of
the
settlers
first
covered
this
frame
with
woven
wire
to
keep
the
stock
from
eating
into
the
hay
we
left
ours
open
between
the
poles
as
a
through
which
pinto
could
eat
hay
without
any
work
or
responsibility
on
our
part
then
one
day
ida
mary
went
swinging
down
the
trail
to
her
school
a
small
child
at
each
side
the
schoolhouse
was
much
like
any
country
school
but
smaller
and
more
cheaply
built
it
had
long
wooden
benches
and
a
rusty
stove
and
in
fine
weather
a
dozen
or
more
pupils
who
ranged
in
age
from
very
young
children
to
great
farm
boys
who
towered
over
ida
mary
but
whom
somehow
she
learned
to
manage
effortlessly
in
that
serene
fashion
of
hers
in
bad
weather
when
it
was
difficult
to
travel
across
the
prairie
her
class
dwindled
until
at
times
she
had
no
pupils
at
all
illustration
iii
any
fool
can
set
type
mcclure
south
dakota
it
on
the
map
was
the
halfway
point
on
the
stage
line
between
pierre
and
presho
three
or
four
miles
from
our
claim
it
consisted
of
the
halfway
house
which
combined
the
functions
of
a
general
store
a
post
office
a
restaurant
and
a
news
center
for
the
whole
community
with
the
barns
and
corrals
of
the
old
mcclure
ranch
and
set
off
a
few
rods
from
the
house
there
was
another
building
a
small
crude
affair
that
looked
like
a
homesteader
shack
across
its
rough
board
front
was
a
sign
painted
in
big
black
letters
the
mcclure
press
the
first
time
i
saw
that
sign
i
laughed
aloud
what
on
earth
is
a
newspaper
doing
out
here
i
asked
randall
the
proprietor
of
the
halfway
house
it
a
sheet
he
answered
not
realizing
that
the
brief
explanation
could
mean
little
to
a
stranger
these
sheets
however
were
becoming
an
important
branch
of
the
western
newspaper
industry
popping
up
over
the
frontier
for
the
sole
purpose
of
publishing
the
proof
notices
of
the
homesteaders
as
required
by
the
government
each
settler
must
have
published
for
five
consecutive
weeks
in
the
paper
nearest
his
land
his
intention
to
make
proof
secure
title
to
the
land
with
the
names
of
witnesses
to
attest
that
he
had
lived
up
to
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
government
also
according
to
government
ruling
such
newspapers
were
to
be
paid
five
dollars
by
the
landholder
for
each
final
proof
published
and
any
contestant
to
a
settler
right
to
the
land
must
pay
a
publication
fee
thereby
a
new
enterprise
was
created
the
newspaper
these
weeklies
carried
small
news
items
with
a
smattering
of
advertising
from
surrounding
trade
centers
but
they
were
made
up
mostly
of
proofs
and
material
supplied
by
the
newspaper
syndicates
that
furnished
the
prints
leaving
one
or
two
blank
sheets
as
required
by
the
publisher
for
home
print
the
mcclure
had
two
pages
of
home
print
including
the
legal
notices
this
paper
was
a
proof
sheet
pure
and
simple
run
by
a
girl
homesteader
who
had
worked
on
a
minneapolis
paper
myrtle
combs
was
a
printer
she
threw
the
type
together
threw
it
onto
the
press
and
off
again
slammed
the
door
shut
mounted
her
old
white
horse
and
with
a
gallon
pail
filled
with
water
at
the
trough
tied
to
the
saddlehorn
went
loping
back
to
her
claim
four
or
five
miles
away
but
myrtle
could
be
depended
upon
to
get
out
the
notices
which
was
all
the
owner
required
one
day
when
i
went
for
the
mail
she
called
to
me
say
you
want
the
job
of
running
this
newspaper
i
proving
up
going
home
we
needed
the
extra
money
badly
time
came
in
early
spring
to
get
our
deed
and
go
home
would
require
nearly
which
ida
a
month
would
not
cover
besides
i
felt
that
i
had
been
a
heavy
expense
to
ida
mary
because
of
my
illness
on
the
road
and
i
did
not
want
to
continue
to
be
a
burden
to
her
she
had
succeeded
in
finding
a
way
to
earn
money
and
i
was
eager
to
do
my
own
part
i
did
know
as
much
about
running
a
newspaper
as
a
hog
knows
about
sunday
it
was
a
hard
dirty
job
which
i
was
not
physically
equipped
to
handle
but
i
had
lived
on
a
homestead
long
enough
to
learn
some
fundamental
things
that
while
a
woman
had
more
independence
here
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
she
was
expected
to
contribute
as
much
as
a
man
not
in
the
same
way
it
is
true
but
to
the
same
degree
that
people
who
fought
the
frontier
had
to
be
prepared
to
meet
any
emergency
that
the
person
who
was
willing
to
try
anything
once
was
equipped
to
be
a
settler
i
try
it
anyhow
any
fool
can
learn
to
set
type
myrtle
said
cheerfully
then
throw
it
into
the
the
iron
rectangle
the
size
of
the
page
in
which
the
columns
of
type
are
encased
ready
to
print
if
it
do
stick
here
a
box
of
matches
whittle
down
and
just
keep
sticking
in
where
the
type
loose
until
it
does
stick
she
locked
the
form
by
means
of
hammering
tight
together
two
iron
pieces
several
sets
of
them
between
type
and
iron
frame
which
were
supposed
to
hold
the
type
in
the
form
like
a
vise
raised
it
carefully
and
there
remained
on
the
table
about
a
quarter
of
a
column
of
the
set
type
she
slammed
the
form
down
in
place
again
unlocked
it
with
an
iron
thing
she
called
the
key
inserted
more
leads
and
slugs
between
the
lines
of
type
jamming
them
closer
together
if
you
need
more
leads
or
slugs
between
the
lines
she
said
some
condensed
milk
cans
just
take
these
and
she
held
up
a
pair
of
long
shears
and
cut
you
some
leads
she
suited
the
words
to
action
took
the
mallet
and
smoothed
the
edges
of
the
oblong
she
had
cut
i
watched
her
ink
the
roller
run
it
over
the
form
on
the
press
put
the
blank
paper
on
give
the
press
a
few
turns
and
behold
the
printed
page
with
this
somewhat
limited
training
i
proceeded
to
get
out
the
paper
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
mechanics
and
it
was
a
hard
job
then
a
belated
thought
struck
me
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
owner
for
the
job
or
at
any
rate
inform
him
that
i
had
taken
it
from
i
found
the
publisher
name
was
senn
i
learned
that
he
owned
a
long
string
of
proof
sheets
a
monopoly
out
here
on
the
raw
prairie
folks
said
he
was
close
as
the
bark
on
a
tree
and
heartless
as
a
wall
street
corporation
with
this
encouragement
i
decided
to
ask
for
a
week
myrtle
had
received
only
of
course
i
had
no
experience
as
a
printer
but
i
explained
to
senn
my
plans
for
pushing
the
business
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
afford
that
extra
a
week
of
my
experience
as
a
typesetter
i
wisely
said
nothing
while
i
waited
for
the
owner
reply
i
went
on
getting
out
the
paper
there
was
no
holding
up
an
issue
of
a
proof
newspaper
like
the
show
it
must
go
on
the
department
of
the
interior
running
our
public
lands
saw
to
that
friday
paper
might
come
out
the
following
monday
or
wednesday
but
it
must
come
out
that
word
consecutive
in
the
proof
law
was
an
awful
stickler
but
everyone
who
had
hung
around
the
print
shop
watching
myrtle
work
took
a
hand
helping
me
when
the
publisher
replied
to
my
letter
he
asked
me
about
my
experience
as
a
printer
and
added
i
do
know
whether
you
are
worth
a
week
more
than
myrtle
or
not
but
anybody
that
has
the
nerve
you
exhibit
in
asking
for
it
no
doubt
deserves
it
moreover
i
like
to
flatter
such
youthful
vanity
he
called
it
nerve
and
i
had
thought
i
was
as
retiring
as
an
antelope
but
the
main
reason
for
his
granting
my
demand
was
that
he
could
not
find
anyone
else
to
do
the
work
on
short
notice
printers
were
not
to
be
picked
up
on
every
i
made
no
reply
to
this
letter
a
week
later
i
was
perched
on
my
high
stool
at
the
nonpareil
a
small
type
case
when
the
stage
rolled
in
from
presho
into
the
print
shop
walked
a
stranger
a
slender
energetic
man
of
medium
height
he
looked
things
over
including
me
and
so
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
king
it
did
not
take
long
to
find
out
how
little
i
knew
about
printing
a
newspaper
so
in
desperation
i
laid
before
him
an
ambitious
plan
for
adding
subscriptions
and
another
page
of
home
print
filled
with
advertising
from
pierre
the
trip
alone
he
reminded
me
would
cost
all
of
probably
and
besides
he
added
if
you
did
get
ads
you
could
set
them
up
with
that
final
fling
at
my
inefficiency
he
took
the
stage
on
to
pierre
the
average
newspaperman
would
have
sneered
at
these
plains
printing
outfits
and
thrown
the
junk
out
on
the
prairie
to
be
buried
under
the
snowdrifts
but
not
many
of
us
were
eligible
to
the
title
the
mcclure
consisted
of
a
few
cases
of
old
type
a
couple
of
forms
an
ink
roller
and
a
pot
of
ink
a
tin
slab
laid
on
top
of
a
rough
frame
for
a
table
completing
the
outfit
was
a
hand
press
that
what
they
called
it
but
it
needed
a
motor
to
run
it
a
flat
press
which
went
back
and
forth
under
a
heavy
iron
roller
that
was
turned
with
a
crank
like
a
clothes
wringer
my
whole
outfit
seemed
to
have
come
from
noah
ark
most
of
the
type
was
nicked
having
suffered
from
the
blows
of
wooden
hammer
she
used
the
hammer
when
it
failed
to
make
a
smooth
surface
in
the
form
that
would
pass
under
the
roller
readers
had
to
guess
at
about
half
the
news
i
printed
and
the
united
states
land
office
developed
a
sort
of
character
system
of
deciphering
the
notices
which
i
filed
every
week
but
running
proof
notices
was
not
merely
the
blacksmith
job
that
myrtle
had
made
it
appear
it
required
accuracy
to
the
degree
the
proofs
ran
something
like
this
blanche
bartine
of
mcclure
who
made
homestead
entry
no
serial
no
for
the
south
of
the
ne
and
north
of
se
of
section
township
north
range
west
of
the
fifth
principal
meridian
has
filed
notice
of
intention
to
make
final
computation
proof
to
establish
claim
etc
then
the
names
of
four
witnesses
were
added
and
the
signature
of
the
land
office
register
of
that
district
one
day
a
man
went
to
town
with
a
string
of
witnesses
to
prove
up
he
intended
to
go
on
to
iowa
without
returning
to
the
claim
that
night
he
walked
angrily
into
the
print
shop
and
laid
a
copy
of
his
published
notice
before
me
together
with
a
note
from
the
land
office
i
had
him
proving
up
somewhere
out
in
the
pacific
ocean
having
given
the
wrong
meridian
for
that
typographical
error
the
man
must
wait
until
i
republished
the
notice
washington
so
the
man
at
pierre
said
was
not
granting
deeds
for
claims
in
one
ca
be
inexact
with
the
government
red
tape
but
on
the
whole
the
work
was
not
as
trivial
as
it
may
appear
with
every
proof
notice
published
in
these
obscure
proof
sheets
acres
of
wasteland
passed
into
privately
owned
farm
units
and
for
this
gigantic
public
works
project
there
was
not
a
cent
appropriated
either
by
state
or
federal
government
one
day
when
the
corn
was
in
the
milk
that
season
which
the
indians
celebrate
with
their
famous
corn
dance
we
saw
wilomene
white
streaking
across
the
plains
on
old
buckskin
her
pony
wilomene
was
a
familiar
sight
on
the
prairie
and
the
sight
of
her
short
plump
figure
jolting
up
and
down
in
a
stiff
gallop
as
though
she
were
on
a
wooden
horse
water
keg
hanging
from
her
saddlehorn
just
in
case
she
come
across
any
water
was
welcome
wherever
she
went
it
does
matter
whether
it
illness
or
a
civic
problem
or
a
hoedown
wilomene
is
always
called
on
people
said
and
she
was
repaid
for
every
hardship
she
went
through
by
the
fun
she
had
telling
about
it
while
her
rich
contagious
laughter
rang
over
the
whole
country
today
there
was
no
water
keg
bouncing
up
and
down
behind
old
buckskin
that
in
itself
was
ominous
for
all
his
deformity
and
declining
years
she
descended
on
us
like
paul
revere
she
galloped
up
dismounted
jerked
a
chicago
newspaper
out
of
the
saddlebag
and
pointed
to
a
big
black
headline
look
at
this
the
reservation
is
going
to
be
thrown
open
the
east
is
all
excited
there
will
be
thousands
out
here
to
register
at
the
land
office
in
pierre
railroads
are
going
to
run
special
trains
what
reservation
we
wanted
to
know
the
indian
reservation
just
across
the
fence
wilomene
explained
the
fence
was
merely
a
string
of
barbed
wire
miles
long
which
marked
the
boundary
of
our
territory
and
separated
it
from
the
indian
reservation
i
glanced
at
the
paper
announcing
the
great
opening
of
the
lower
brulé
by
the
united
states
government
which
was
to
take
place
that
fall
some
hundred
thousand
acres
of
homestead
land
here
we
were
at
the
very
door
of
that
opening
and
had
to
be
told
about
it
by
eastern
newspapers
so
completely
cut
off
from
the
world
we
were
what
good
will
that
do
us
practical
ida
mary
inquired
it
will
help
develop
this
section
of
the
country
and
bring
up
the
price
of
our
land
that
was
worth
considering
but
ida
mary
and
i
were
not
dealing
in
futures
just
then
we
were
too
busy
putting
away
winter
food
corn
and
the
chokecherries
we
had
found
along
a
dry
creek
bank
patching
the
tar
paper
on
the
shack
like
most
of
the
settlers
we
were
busier
than
cranberry
merchants
getting
ready
for
the
long
winter
but
there
is
a
great
satisfaction
in
doing
simple
fundamental
things
with
one
hands
that
evening
however
i
picked
up
the
pamphlet
on
the
opening
which
wilomene
had
left
it
announced
that
the
united
states
government
would
open
the
lower
brulé
reservation
to
entry
for
homesteading
on
a
given
date
at
this
time
any
american
citizen
eligible
as
a
claimholder
could
register
as
an
entry
in
the
drawing
for
a
homestead
and
after
the
registrations
were
closed
there
would
be
a
drawing
out
up
to
the
number
of
claims
on
the
reservation
eligible
persons
were
to
register
at
the
united
states
land
offices
most
conveniently
located
and
designated
by
the
general
land
office
in
washington
for
a
of
the
land
the
next
day
i
was
a
stage
passenger
on
the
return
trip
to
pierre
to
get
detailed
information
on
the
lower
brulé
opening
from
the
united
states
land
office
with
a
new
and
reckless
abandon
i
listed
the
expenditure
and
received
a
prompt
reply
from
the
proof
magnate
i
note
an
unauthorized
expense
of
trip
to
pierre
you
are
getting
to
be
an
unruly
outlaw
of
a
printer
then
i
forgot
the
coming
land
opening
there
were
days
that
early
fall
when
mcclure
was
lifeless
and
i
would
work
all
day
without
seeing
a
human
being
anywhere
over
the
plains
in
the
drowsiness
of
the
clicking
of
my
type
falling
into
the
stick
and
the
pounding
of
the
form
with
the
mallet
would
echo
through
the
broad
silence
and
one
day
in
october
the
stage
driver
rushed
into
the
shop
shouting
say
printer
she
open
blowed
wide
open
illustration
iv
the
biggest
lottery
in
history
it
is
an
extraordinary
fact
that
one
of
the
most
gigantic
and
certainly
the
most
rapid
land
settlements
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
has
been
little
known
and
little
recognized
either
for
its
vast
scope
or
its
importance
the
passing
of
the
frontier
with
its
profound
effects
upon
american
life
is
not
a
part
of
our
early
history
it
ended
with
the
world
war
the
trek
of
early
settlers
in
covered
wagons
the
swift
and
colorful
growth
of
the
cattle
kingdom
the
land
rush
at
cimarron
are
a
part
of
our
familiar
history
but
the
greatest
of
all
these
expansion
movements
was
at
its
height
within
the
twentieth
century
with
acres
of
public
land
opened
by
the
government
for
settlement
waste
land
which
in
a
few
seasons
produced
crops
supported
villages
towns
and
finally
cities
in
their
lightning
growth
in
a
sense
the
united
states
government
conducted
a
vast
lottery
with
land
as
stakes
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
gambling
their
time
and
strength
and
hope
on
the
future
of
the
west
the
land
so
lavishly
disposed
of
was
the
white
man
last
raid
on
the
indian
the
period
of
bloody
warfare
was
long
past
the
last
struggle
against
confiscation
of
indian
land
was
over
and
the
indians
were
segregated
through
treaties
on
tracts
designated
by
the
government
like
the
cattle
on
the
range
being
driven
back
to
winter
pasture
or
the
buffalo
driven
off
the
plains
to
which
they
mournfully
compared
their
fate
and
if
there
is
anything
an
indian
hates
it
is
boundaries
the
migration
and
settlement
of
vast
numbers
of
people
has
changed
world
history
time
and
time
again
and
the
americans
have
been
a
migrating
people
from
the
early
years
of
their
first
settlement
of
the
colonies
there
had
been
a
steady
movement
toward
the
west
without
the
west
with
its
great
public
lands
the
united
states
as
it
has
become
could
hardly
have
existed
while
there
was
a
frontier
to
develop
land
for
the
small
owner
there
would
always
be
independence
european
theories
might
influence
the
east
from
time
to
time
but
there
was
always
a
means
of
escape
for
the
man
or
woman
oppressed
by
labor
conditions
by
tendencies
to
establish
class
distinctions
public
land
on
the
land
men
must
face
primitive
conditions
as
best
they
could
but
they
were
independent
because
the
land
was
their
own
their
earnings
their
own
for
many
years
the
public
land
seemed
inexhaustible
it
was
not
until
the
civil
war
had
been
waged
for
two
years
with
the
country
disrupted
by
conflict
and
people
looking
as
they
will
in
times
of
disaster
for
a
place
where
they
might
be
at
peace
that
they
realized
the
desirable
land
at
the
government
disposal
was
gone
but
there
remained
the
land
of
the
red
men
and
white
settlers
looked
on
it
and
found
it
good
they
raised
a
clamor
for
it
and
the
most
determined
staked
out
their
claims
and
lived
on
it
regardless
of
treaty
as
a
result
the
government
yielded
to
public
pressure
and
took
over
the
land
from
the
indians
forcing
them
back
once
more
it
was
quite
as
simple
as
it
sounds
of
course
it
took
some
years
and
nearly
a
thousand
battles
of
one
kind
and
another
to
do
it
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
land
again
had
been
absorbed
by
the
people
settled
in
accordance
with
the
homestead
act
of
and
the
demand
continued
the
government
then
bought
oklahoma
from
the
indians
in
it
was
impossible
to
satisfy
all
those
who
wanted
homesteads
and
difficult
to
choose
those
who
should
have
them
a
plan
was
therefore
hit
upon
to
give
everyone
a
chance
on
the
day
of
the
oklahoma
opening
throngs
of
white
settlers
stood
at
the
boundary
and
at
a
given
signal
rushed
upon
the
land
taking
it
by
speed
and
strategy
and
trickery
and
too
often
by
violence
within
hours
the
land
was
occupied
within
a
week
there
were
frame
buildings
over
the
prairie
and
villages
and
towns
followed
at
a
speed
inconceivable
to
the
foreign
nations
which
looked
on
breathless
and
staggered
at
the
energy
of
a
people
who
measured
the
building
of
a
western
empire
not
by
generations
but
by
seasons
and
the
demand
for
land
continued
there
was
a
depression
in
the
east
and
jobs
were
hard
to
get
with
the
growth
of
factories
many
young
men
and
women
had
flocked
from
farms
and
villages
to
cities
and
they
were
not
finding
conditions
to
their
liking
they
wanted
to
return
to
the
life
they
knew
best
the
life
of
the
farm
in
the
more
populous
sections
the
price
of
land
was
rising
and
was
already
beyond
the
reach
of
many
pocketbooks
there
remained
only
public
land
land
which
was
allotted
to
the
indians
the
government
accordingly
began
to
withdraw
from
the
indian
allotments
great
tracts
by
further
treaties
and
deals
slashing
boundary
lines
relegating
the
indians
to
the
unceded
part
of
the
land
the
great
tracts
thus
acquired
were
then
surveyed
into
and
thrown
open
to
homesteading
in
order
to
prevent
the
violence
which
had
attended
the
oklahoma
land
opening
a
new
method
was
hit
upon
a
proclamation
was
issued
by
president
theodore
roosevelt
announcing
the
opening
of
land
on
the
lower
brulé
indian
reservation
as
i
had
learned
on
that
flying
trip
to
pierre
the
operation
of
the
plan
was
very
simple
were
to
register
at
the
land
office
in
pierre
making
an
affidavit
showing
their
qualifications
to
enter
at
which
time
each
would
receive
a
number
on
a
given
day
october
the
numbered
envelopes
containing
the
affidavits
which
had
been
deposited
in
large
containers
fastened
and
sealed
so
that
they
could
not
be
opened
were
to
be
drawn
by
lot
after
having
been
thoroughly
mixed
as
many
numbers
drawn
as
there
were
to
dispose
of
the
first
person
whose
number
corresponded
with
the
number
drawn
had
first
choice
of
the
land
government
posters
and
advertisements
for
the
land
opening
were
published
in
every
section
of
the
country
and
along
with
the
government
publicity
appeared
the
advertisements
of
the
railroads
for
them
increased
population
in
this
area
was
a
crying
need
while
we
had
drowsed
through
the
lazy
autumn
days
advertising
campaigns
were
shrieking
to
the
people
all
over
the
country
of
the
last
frontier
and
that
october
day
it
blowed
wide
open
into
the
little
town
of
pierre
they
swarmed
by
train
by
stagecoach
by
automobile
by
wagon
on
foot
men
and
women
from
every
part
of
the
country
from
almost
every
state

who
had
been
crowded
out
of
cities
people
who
wanted
to
settle
as
real
dirt
farmers
people
who
wanted
cheap
land
and
the
inevitable
trailers
who
were
come
prepared
to
profit
by
someone
else
good
luck
like
a
thundering
herd
they
stampeded
the
united
states
land
office
at
pierre
the
strip
the
strip
one
heard
on
every
side
it
was
called
the
strip
because
the
tract
was
long
and
narrow
one
day
the
little
frontier
town
of
pierre
drowsed
through
a
hot
afternoon
and
the
broad
plains
lay
tenantless
devoid
of
any
sign
that
men
had
passed
that
way
the
next
day
the
region
swarmed
with
strangers
sturdy
farmers
city
boys
young
girls
alert
laughing
all
sons
and
daughters
of
america
not
an
immigrant
peasant
among
them
plumbers
and
lawyers
failures
and
people
weary
of
routine
young
men
from
agricultural
colleges
eager
to
try
scientific
methods
of
farming
and
older
men
from
europe
prepared
to
use
the
methods
they
had
found
good
for
generations
raucous
land
agents
and
quiet
racketeers
alert
for
some
way
of
making
easy
money
from
the
tense
anxious
excited
throng
for
many
of
that
jostling
bewildered
desperately
anxious
throng
the
land
was
their
last
chance
to
establish
themselves
and
yet
the
atmosphere
was
that
of
a
local
fair
loud
with
shouting
with
barkers
crying
their
wares
with
the
exclamations
of
wonder
of
people
looking
upon
a
new
country
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
tense
excitement
and
suspense
that
attends
any
gambling
game
mcclure
the
halfway
house
where
my
little
print
shop
had
been
thrown
up
was
the
only
stopping
place
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
at
the
end
of
the
main
road
from
pierre
to
the
reservation
which
lay
some
five
miles
on
across
the
prairie
all
that
day
the
landseekers
pushed
their
way
into
the
shed
annex
which
served
as
a
dining
room
of
the
halfway
house
and
filled
the
table
which
stretched
from
end
to
end
if
there
was
no
room
for
them
they
ate
lunches
from
the
store
food
supply
at
the
counter
we
who
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
empty
prairie
to
whom
the
arrival
of
the
stage
from
pierre
was
an
event
were
overwhelmed
by
the
confusion
the
avalanche
of
people
shouting
pushing
asking
questions
moving
steadily
across
the
trackless
plains
toward
the
reservation
every
homesteader
who
had
a
tug
that
would
fasten
over
a
doubletree
a
wagon
that
could
still
squeak
or
a
flivver
that
had
a
bolt
in
it
went
into
the
transportation
business
hauling
the
seekers
from
pierre
or
from
mcclure
to
look
at
the
land
a
generation
before
people
had
migrated
in
little
groups
in
covered
wagons
to
find
new
land
now
they
came
by
automobile
and
railroad
in
colonies
like
a
great
tidal
wave
but
the
spirit
that
drove
them
was
still
the
pioneer
spirit
and
the
conditions
to
be
faced
were
essentially
the
same
the
stubborn
earth
and
painful
labor
drought
and
famine
and
cold
and
the
revolving
cycle
of
the
seasons
shucks
it
simple
as
tying
your
shoe
stage
driver
bill
assured
the
excited
confused
landseekers
jest
take
enough
grub
to
last
a
coupla
days
and
a
bottle
or
two
of
strong
whisky
and
git
in
line
at
the
land
office
the
settlers
were
almost
as
excited
as
the
landseekers
for
many
of
them
it
was
the
first
opportunity
they
had
had
since
their
arrival
to
earn
a
cash
dollar
and
while
the
gambling
fever
was
high
it
was
easy
to
persuade
the
newcomers
to
spend
what
they
could
coffee
sandwiches
foods
of
every
description
were
prepared
in
great
quantities
and
disposed
of
to
clamoring
hordes
it
seemed
a
pity
i
could
find
some
way
of
making
some
money
too
i
would
without
wasting
time
i
wrote
some
verses
on
the
land
opening
made
a
drawing
to
accompany
them
and
sent
it
to
a
printer
at
pierre
to
have
postcards
made
of
it
wilomene
white
had
made
some
belts
and
hatbands
of
snakeskins
and
she
planned
to
put
them
together
with
my
cards
wherever
we
could
sell
them
as
souvenirs
i
rode
in
at
daylight
for
the
cards
but
the
town
was
already
astir
people
stood
in
line
in
front
of
the
land
office
waiting
to
get
in
to
register
some
of
them
had
stood
there
all
night
some
sat
on
the
steps
cold
hungry
and
exhausted
but
they
had
come
a
long
way
and
could
not
afford
to
miss
their
chance
every
train
that
came
in
was
loaded
with
men
and
women
the
little
state
capital
became
a
bedlam
and
the
land
office
was
besieged
they
crawled
along
in
a
line
that
did
not
seem
to
move
they
munched
little
lunches
a
few
fainted
from
exhaustion
and
hunger
but
they
never
gave
up
here
at
last
was
news
that
was
news
for
which
the
press
of
the
country
and
europe
clamored
these
land
openings
were
a
phenomenon
in
the
settling
of
new
territory
beyond
the
conception
of
foreign
countries
reporters
magazine
writers
free
lancers
pushed
in
for
their
stories
of
the
spectacular
event
the
mere
size
of
it
the
gambling
element
the
surging
mobs
who
had
risked
something
to
take
part
in
it
were
material
for
stories
the
real
hero
of
the
stories
of
course
was
the
land
itself
the
last
frontier
there
were
a
few
who
pondered
on
what
its
passing
would
mean
to
the
country
as
a
whole
i
ordered
extra
by
wire
from
the
newspaper
union
and
persuaded
a
to
turn
the
old
press
for
me
bronco
benny
rode
bucking
horses
during
the
day
for
the
entertainment
of
the
tenderfeet
passing
through
and
helped
me
at
night
relating
in
a
soft
western
drawl
the
events
of
the
day
as
he
worked
did
you
see
that
little
gal
wanted
one
o
my
spurs
as
a

wait
a
minute
i
would
interrupt
you
ruined
that
paper
spread
a
little
more

and
i
says
shore
miss
you
do
want
the
pony
throwed
in
pushing
the
roller
lazily
back
and
forth
over
the
inking
table
then
across
the
form
on
the
press
she
ups
and
takes
a
snapshot
he
rambled
on
to
my
delight
the
postcards
were
selling
like
hot
cakes
at
ten
cents
a
piece
the
ammons
finances
were
looking
up
in
many
homes
today
throughout
the
country
there
must
exist
yellowed
copies
of
the
card
the
only
tangible
reminder
of
an
unsuccessful
gamble
in
the
government
lottery
at
midnight
one
night
an
old
spring
wagon
rattled
up
to
the
shack
and
we
heard
the
voice
of
a
man
one
of
the
locators
who
had
been
hauling
seekers
he
held
out
a
handful
of
small
change
here
he
said
proudly
i
sold
every
card
and
here
he
pulled
out
a
note
and
a
small
package
the
note
read
your
poem
is
very
clever
but
your
drawing
is
damn
poor
if
i
a
lucky
number
i
see
you
in
the
spring
in
the
meantime
for
heaven
sake
do
try
any
more
art
stick
to
poetry
it
was
signed
alexander
van
leshout
and
was
accompanied
by
a
cut
this
newspaper
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
was
only
one
of
many
people
from
strange
walks
of
life
who
entered
that
lottery
there
were
others
whose
background
was
equally
alien
to
life
in
a
homestead
cabin
who
came
to
see
the
west
while
it
was
still
unchanged
drawn
for
reasons
of
personal
adventure
or
because
the
romantic
legends
of
the
west
attracted
them
people
drawn
by
the
intangibles
the
freedom
of
great
space
the
touch
of
the
wind
on
their
faces
a
return
to
the
simple
elements
of
living
standing
in
the
dreary
lines
in
the
land
office
where
some
of
them
waited
for
as
long
as
two
days
and
nights
at
a
time
we
saw
farmers
business
men
boys
men
and
women
a
woman
in
her
late
sixties
holding
tightly
to
an
old
man
kept
saying
encouragingly
just
hold
on
a
little
longer
and
whenever
we
passed
we
heard
her
asking
of
those
about
her
where
you
from
we
from
blue
springs
the
land
office
recorded
the
man
as
david
wagor
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
a
naturalized
citizen
in
order
to
register
but
it
was
necessary
to
have
filed
intention
to
become
a
citizen
one
must
be
either
single
or
the
head
of
a
family
wives
therefore
could
not
register
for
that
reason
we
were
interested
in
a
frail
young
woman
a
mere
girl
sagging
under
the
weight
of
a
baby
on
her
arm
patiently
waiting
her
turn
she
was
shabbily
dressed
with
a
trace
of
gentility
in
clothes
and
manner
whether
she
was
a
widow
or
unmarried
only
the
land
office
knew
but
it
pinched
the
heart
to
realize
the
straits
of
a
fragile
girl
who
was
ready
to
undertake
the
burden
of
a
homestead
alone
you
are
getting
to

wrote
me

authorized
to
incur
this
additional
expense
but
catching
the
excitement
of
the
crowds
and
perhaps
a
little
of
their
gambling
spirit
i
was
not
upset
by
his
reproof
i
filled
the
paper
with
the
news
items
about
the
opening
and
sold
out
every
copy
to
the
landseekers
passing
through
the
plains

overnight
and
swelled
with
pride
as
the
tenderfeet
said
you
westerners
responded
exuberantly
to
the
sudden
life
about
us
cowboys
rode
in
from
the
far
ranges
for
one
helluva
time
they
did
kowtow
to
this
game
but
they
could
play

and
they
gamblin
for

could

but
they
stake
two

three

they
rode
down

streets
gaudy
outfits
glittering
in
the
sun
with
spurs
clicking
they
swung
the
eastern
gals
at
a
big
dance
and
the
dignity
of
the
state

be
damned
the
whole

was
in
holiday
mood
ida
mary
dismissed
school
at
noon
no
one
cared
whether
school
kept
or
not
and
we
put
on
our
prettiest
dresses
to
join
the
crowd
through
the
throngs
pushed
the
land
locators
they
stood
on
curbs
in
front
of
the
land
office
and
the
hotels
grabbing
and
holding
onto
their
prospects
like
leeches
they
had
been
accustomed
to
landing
a
settler
once
in
a
blue
moon
driving
the
prospect
over
miles
of
plain
showing
him
land
in
various
remote
districts
in
the
hope
that
he
would
find
some
to
suit
him
now
they
had
dozens
clamoring
for
every
this
was
their
golden
harvest
nearly
all
the
seekers
were
too
avid
for
land
to
be
particular
about
its
location
and
many
of
them
too
ignorant
of
the
soil
to
know
which
was
the
best
plumb
locoed
bill
described
the
excited
seekers
the
charging
to
an
acre
for
that
land
i
drive
right
over
vacant
homesteads
just
as
good
for
think
they
look
at
it
but
we
are
a
gambling
people
and
the
grass
on
the
other
side
of
the
reservation
fence
looked
a
lot
better
after
they
registered
most
of
the
landseekers
wanted
to
see
the
land
and
pick
out
a
claim
just
in
case
they
won
one
the
chances
of
winning
must
have
seemed
slim
with
that
avalanche
of
people
registering
and
the
results
would
not
be
known
until
the
drawing
which
would
be
a
week
or
more
after
the
entry
closed
late
one
afternoon
a
crowd
stood
on
the
border
of
the
strip
on
the
outside
of
the
old
fence
that
divided
it
from
the
rest
of
space
and
the
wire
gate
stood
open
the
landseekers
who
had
driven
over
the
land
stood
looking
across
it
sobered
i
think
it
occurred
to
them
for
the
first
time
that
this
was
a
land
where
one
had
to
begin
at
the
beginning
the
buffalo
and
the
indian
had
each
had
his
day
on
this
land
and
each
had
gone
without
leaving
a
trace
it
was
untouched
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
it
stretched
golden
under
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
whether
the
magnitude
of
the
task
ahead
frightened
or
exhilarated
them
the
landseekers
were
all
a
little
awed
at
that
moment
even
i
seeing
the
endless
sweep
of
that
sea
of
golden
grass
forgot
for
the
moment
the
dry
crackling
sound
of
it
under
wheel
and
foot
and
the
awful
monotony
of
its
endlessness
which
could
be
so
and
by
the
gods
the
grass
was
higher
and
thicker
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
how
rich
the
soil
must
be
to
raise
grass
like
that
they
said
to
each
other
groups
of
men
and
women
gathered
closer
together
as
though
for
some
unconscious
protection
against
the
emptiness
around
the
fence
stood
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
saddle
horses
and
a
few
ponies
on
which
cowboys
sat
lazily
looking
on
even
those
who
had
come
only
for
adventure
were
silenced
they
felt
the
challenge
of
the
land
and
were
no
longer
in
a
mood
to
scoff
standing
at
that
fence
was
like
standing
at
the
gate
of
the
promised
land
and
the
only
way
in
was
through
the
casual
drawing
of
numbers
they
stood
long
staring
at
the
land
which
lay
so
golden
in
the
sun
and
which
only
a
few
could
possess
there
were
more
real
dirt
farmers
represented
here
than
there
had
been
in
most
of
the
homestead
projects
men
who
were
equipped
to
farm
but
they
were
still
in
the
minority
they
picked
up
handfuls
of
the
earth
that
the
locators
turned
over
with
spades
let
it
sift
through
their
fingers
and
pronounced
it
good
a
rich
loam
not
so
heavy
or
black
as
the
soil
back
east
but
better
adapted
perhaps
to
the
climate
aside
from
the
farmers
nobody
seemed
to
know
or
care
anything
about
the
soil
or
precipitation
and
ironically
enough
it
occurred
to
no
one
to
ask
about
the
water
supply
the
land
back
east
is
too
the
city
laborer
declared
we
can
never
hope
to
own
any
of
it
we
rather
risk
the
hazards
of
a
raw
country
said
the
tenant
farmer
than
be
tenants
always
we
sell
our
eastern
land
at
a
high
price
said
the
landowners
and
improve
new
land
my
mother
took
in
washing
to
save
money
said
an
boy
so
i
could
make
this
trip
but
if
i
win
a
whole
and
how
big
a
looked
to
a
city
dweller
i
make
a
good
home
for
her
a
widow
from

told
the
group
about
her
i
mortgaged
my
cottage
to
come
the
boys
are
growing
up
and
it
their
only
chance
to
own
land
others
in
the
group
nodded
their
heads
yes
land
is
solid
leaning
heavily
on
his
cane
a
little
old
man
with
a
long
white
mustache
and
sharp
eyes
denounced
the
lottery
method
right
do
give
a
feller
a
chanct
look
at
me
with
my
rheumatiz
and
i
got
as
good
a
chanct
as
any
of
brains
nor
legs
do
count
in
this
now
in
the
oklahomy
run
and
he
told
about
the
oklahoma
run
of
almost
a
generation
before
when
speed
and
strategy
were
necessary
if
one
were
to
be
first
on
the
land
to
stake
a
claim
but
the
oklahoma
run
for
all
its
drama
and
its
violence
dwindled
in
importance
beside
these
drawings
with
their
fabulous
areas
and
their
armies
of
people
across
the
prairie
came
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
heavy
rumbling
of
a
wagon
a
locator
with
a
hayrack
full
of
seekers
was
coming
at
a
reckless
pace
not
stopping
for
the
trails
at
the
reservation
gate
he
brought
the
team
to
a
quick
stop
that
almost
threw
his
passengers
off
the
wagon
some
of
them
were
so
stiff
and
sore
they
could
get
off
their
cushion
of
hay
others
were
unable
to
stand
after
they
got
up
but
the
locator
was
not
disturbed
by
a
little
thing
like
that
he
waved
his
right
arm
taking
in
at
one
sweep
the
vacant
expanse
to
the
rim
of
the
horizon
and
shouted
here
your
land
folks
here
your
land
he
was
locating
them
en
masse
at
to
a
head
no
hunting
up
corner
stakes
it
all
looked
alike
to
these
bewildered
people
anyhow
drunk
as
they
were
with
the
intoxication
that
land
lotteries
produce
he
turned
his
weary
team
and
human
cargo
around
and
started
back
to
town
a
wholesale
locator
had
no
time
for
sleep
he
must
collect
another
hayrackful
of
seekers
early
next
morning
some
of
these
landseekers
tried
to
analyze
the
reasons
for
this
great
movement
the
factors
which
had
swept
them
along
with
this
tidal
wave
of
human
migration
we
concentrated
too
much
in
cities
they
said
crowded
and
stifled
and
our
roots
are
choked
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
land
where
a
man
can
grow
himself
the
things
he
needs
to
live
on
and
where
his
children
can
grow
up
with
the
country
and
have
a
place
in
it
our
attitude
toward
the
land
is
peculiar
to
america
the
european
conception
of
a
plot
of
ground
on
which
a
family
is
rooted
for
generations
has
little
meaning
for
people
who
move
by
the
thousands
onto
untamed
acres
transform
it
into
plowed
fields
and
settlements
and
towns
and
move
on
endlessly
to
plow
new
fields
this
constantly
renewed
search
for
fresh
pastures
has
kept
the
country
vital
just
as
the
existence
of
its
western
public
lands
has
kept
it
democratic
for
its
endurance
the
american
spirit
owes
much
to
its
frontier
beside
me
stood
a
young
man
a
newspaper
reporter
from
chicago
he
ran
lean
fingers
through
brown
straggly
hair
looking
from
the
strip
reaching
to
the
horizon
to
the
people
waiting
to
shape
it
according
to
their
needs
great
copy
he
said
lamely
but
he
made
no
entry
in
his
notebook
outside
another
gate
five
miles
or
so
beyond
the
main
entrance
from
mcclure
was
a
little
trading
post
cedar
fork
on
the
smith
ranch
the
long
buildings
were
said
to
have
been
a
sort
of
fort
in
the
indian
war
days
the
seekers
overflowed
even
here
and
when
the
swift
darkness
settled
on
the
plains
stayed
for
the
night
the
women
filling
the
store
and
house
while
the
men
slept
in
the
barn
loft
or
haystacks
or
even
in
their
vehicles
they
wrapped
themselves
in
heavy
coats
or
blankets
against
the
biting
chill
of
an
october
night
after
a
day
so
hot
the
tenderfeet
sweltered
and
blistered
under
the
midday
sun
the
next
morning
there
was
frost
with
the
air
sharp
and
fresh
the
smiths
tried
to
feed
the
shivering
hungry
seekers
the
seekers
always
seemed
to
be
hungry
kettles
and
washboilers
full
of
coffee
slabs
of
bacon
sizzling
in
great
pans
and
one
after
another
into
the
hot
grease
slid
a
case
of
eggs
bread
was
sliced
into
a
washtub
shaking
with
cold
coat
collars
turned
up
shawls
and
blankets
wrapped
about
them
tired
and
disheveled
the
seekers
looked
like
a
banished
people
fleeing
from
persecution
but
they
were
not
disheartened
on
october
the
drawing
started
the
registrations
were
put
into
sealed
envelopes
tossed
into
boxes
shuffled
up
and
drawn
out
one
at
a
time
numbered
as
they
were
drawn
out
as
many
numbers
as
there
were
claims
with
an
additional
number
to
allow
for
those
who
did
not
file
or
whose
applications
were
rejected
then
the
filing
of
the
winners
began
most
of
the
seekers
had
already
selected
their
claims
they
had
six
months
time
in
which
to
establish
residence
on
the
land
the
stampede
was
over
after
three
weeks
of
excitement
the
seekers
were
gone
the
plains
regained
their
silence
and
the
settlers
around
mcclure
were
left
to
face
the
frontier
winter
with
its
desolation
and
hardships
the
void
after
the
crowds
had
gone
was
worse
than
if
they
had
never
come
the
weather
had
turned
raw
and
gray
and
there
was
a
threat
of
snow
in
the
air
exhausted
and
let
down
ida
mary
and
i
were
desperately
blue
and
then
we
saw
someone
coming
across
the
plains
the
only
moving
figure
to
be
seen
in
the
cold
gray
dusk
from
the
dim
outline
we
could
barely
make
out
horse
and
rider
but
we
knew
them
both
wilomene
on
old
buckskin
she
was
riding
slowly
as
though
there
were
nothing
left
out
here
now
but
time
she
wore
a
dark
red
flannel
shirtwaist
a
divided
skirt
of
black
wool
a
suede
jacket
and
black
cap
like
a
jockey
there
was
an
easy
strength
and
in
her
carriage
she
crossed
the
firebreak
and
rode
up
over
the
ridge
calling
her
cheery
she
going
to
stay
all
night
exclaimed
ida
mary
seeing
the
small
bag
dangling
from
the
saddlehorn
after
supper
we
counted
the
dimes
we
had
earned
from
the
postcards
more
than
and
far
into
the
night
we
talked
of
the
people
who
had
invaded
the
strip
next
spring
there
would
be
life
again
over
the
plains
when
the
lucky
numbers
came
out
to
live
on
the
strip
would
the
reporter
from
chicago
be
among
them
and
the
mystery
girl
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
pa
wagor
and
a
young
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
it
was
something
to
look
forward
to
when
the
blizzards
shut
us
off
from
the
world
illustration
v
no
place
for
clinging
vines
the
settlers
of
the
mcclure
district
went
on
with
their
work
as
though
there
had
never
been
a
land
opening
the
men
fed
their
stock
and
hauled
fuel
for
winter
while
the
women
tacked
comforters
and
sewed
and
patched
heavy
clothing
ida
mary
went
on
with
her
school
work
and
i
continued
to
wrestle
with
the
newspaper
we
put
a
little
shed
back
of
the
shack
where
we
could
set
buckets
of
coal
and
keep
the
water
can
handy
with
the
postcard
money
we
bought
a
drum
for
the
stovepipe
to
serve
as
an
oven
one
either
baked
his
own
bread
or
did
without
it
huey
dunn
did
some
late
fall
plowing
what
are
you
plowing
your
land
for
now
with
winter
coming
neighbors
asked
for
oats
next
spring
huey
replied
if
the
damn
threshing
machine
gets
around
to
thresh
out
the
oatstack
in
time
to
sow
the
homesteaders
shook
their
heads
there
was
no
figuring
out
when
huey
dunn
would
do
things
this
time
he
was
far
ahead
of
them
they
did
not
know
that
fall
plowing
to
mellow
and
absorb
the
moisture
from
winter
snow
and
spring
rain
was
the
way
to
conquer
the
virgin
soil
they
had
to
find
it
out
through
hard
experience
fallowing
huey
called
it
lasso
said
the
range
is
no
place
for
clingin
vines
there
hai
nothin
to
cling
to
ida
mary
under
that
quiet
manner
of
hers
had
always
been
and
i
was
learning
not
to
cling
i
lived
in
the
print
shop
a
great
deal
of
the
time
that
winter
an
unusually
open
winter
barring
a
few
blizzards
and
deep
snows
i
slept
on
a
rickety
cot
in
one
corner
of
the
room
cooking
my
meals
on
the
monkey
stove
and
often
i
ate
over
at
randall
who
served
meals
for
a
quarter
to
anyone
who
cared
to
stop
the
table
filled
with
steaming
dishes
of
food
i
liked
to
take
the
midday
meal
there
and
meet
people
coming
through
on
the
stage
they
furnished
most
of
the
news
for
the
mcclure
driving
back
and
forth
from
print
shop
to
claim
on
pinto
was
like
crossing
the
desert
on
a
camel
pinto
was
too
lazy
to
trot
uphill
and
too
stiff
to
trot
down
and
as
the
country
was
rough
and
rolling
there
was
not
much
of
the
trail
on
which
we
could
make
any
time
he
could
have
jogged
up
a
little
but
he
was
too
stubborn
he
had
lived
with
the
indians
too
long
that
old
pony
had
a
sly
artful
eye
and
a
way
of
shaking
his
head
that
was
tricky
and
try
to
catch
him
loose
on
the
prairie
with
a
bucket
of
oats
as
a
coaxer
there
were
times
on
the
trail
when
one
could
not
see
him
moving
except
at
close
range
when
he
took
such
a
spell
one
of
us
drove
while
the
other
walked
alongside
persuading
him
to
keep
ahead
of
the
buggy
as
there
was
a
tree
or
shrub
in
that
part
of
the
country
we
were
reduced
to
waving
a
hat
in
front
of
him
like
a
cowboy
taunting
a
bucking
horse
in
the
ring
or
waving
a
dry
cornstalk
at
him
but
all
with
the
same
effect
a
little
spotted
animal
with
long
brown
mane
and
tail
he
was
the
most
noticeable
as
well
as
notorious
piece
of
horseflesh
in
that
region
and
according
to
a
few
who
knew
him
when
he
had
a
past
a
reputation
as
an
outlaw
and
a
dislike
for
the
white
man
as
a
result
of
his
part
in
an
indian
skirmish
against
a
band
of
white
settlers
now
like
the
indian
he
had
become
subdued
with
age
and
conquest
but
like
the
indian
too
stubborn
and
resentful
from
him
we
learned
much
about
how
to
deal
with
the
indian
one
evening
when
i
had
stopped
at
the
school
for
ida
mary
we
saw
a
snowstorm
coming
like
a
white
smoke
we
were
only
half
a
mile
from
home
but
in
blizzards
we
had
been
warned
one
can
easily
become
lost
within
a
few
feet
of
his
own
door
many
plainsmen
have
walked
all
night
in
a
circle
trying
to
find
a
familiar
shack
or
barn
and
perished
within
a
few
yards
of
shelter
even
in
daytime
one
did
not
dare
in
some
of
those
blinding
furies
to
go
from
house
to
barn
without
holding
on
to
a
rope
or
clothesline
kept
stretched
from
one
building
to
the
other
for
that
purpose
we
could
not
take
a
chance
on
pinto
slow
pace
so
we
got
out
of
the
buggy
and
ran
as
fast
as
we
could
leaving
him
to
follow
we
were
barely
inside
when
the
storm
broke
over
the
shack
as
the
snow
came
in
blinding
sheets
we
became
anxious
about
the
pony
but
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
that
night
we
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
looked
out
we
could
not
see
our
hands
before
us
and
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
beating
of
snow
against
the
shack
made
it
impossible
to
hear
any
other
sound
cowering
in
that
tiny
shack
where
thin
took
the
place
of
plaster
the
wind
screaming
across
the
plains
hurling
the
snow
against
that
frail
protection
defenseless
against
the
elemental
fury
of
the
storm
was
like
drifting
in
a
small
boat
at
sea
tossed
and
buffeted
by
waves
each
one
threatening
to
engulf
you
next
day
the
blizzard
broke
and
we
found
pinto
standing
in
the
hayshed
still
hitched
to
the
buggy
quietly
munching
hay
when
the
landseekers
had
left
and
the
plains
had
seemed
emptier
and
more
silent
than
before
it
had
seemed
to
ida
mary
and
me
let
down
from
our
excitement
that
there
was
not
much
incentive
in
doing
anything
but
after
all
there
was
no
time
to
be
bored
that
winter
the
grim
struggle
to
hang
on
demanded
all
our
energy
when
i
had
first
visited
the
mcclure
i
had
looked
distastefully
at
myrtle
hands
and
face
and
at
the
black
apron
stiff
with
ink
which
she
wore
at
her
work
now
there
were
nights
when
after
turning
the
press
or
addressing
papers
still
wet
with
ink
until
midnight
i
fell
upon
the
cot
and
slept
without
washing
or
undressing
at
such
times
myrtle
with
her
cheerful
unconcern
became
an
exalted
creature
the
next
morning
i
would
make
a
stab
at
cleaning
myself
up
eat
breakfast
on
the
small
inking
table
drawn
close
to
the
fire
with
a
clean
paper
over
the
black
surface
for
a
tablecloth
and
go
to
work
again
when
blizzards
raged
they
drove
the
snow
through
the
shack
like
needles
of
steel
there
was
not
a
spot
where
i
could
put
that
cot
to
keep
dry
so
i
covered
my
face
with
the
blankets
which
in
the
morning
were
drifted
over
with
snow
where
did
the
lumber
industry
get
hold
of
all
the
knotholes
it
sold
the
poor
homesteader
for
a
girl
who
had
come
to
the
prairie
for
her
health
i
was
getting
heroic
treatment
wrestling
all
day
with
the
heavy
outworn
printing
press
heavy
manual
labor
for
long
hours
sleeping
with
the
snow
drifting
over
me
at
night
it
was
during
one
of
these
great
storms
that
i
rode
in
one
of
the
last
covered
wagons
one
of
the
few
tangible
links
between
the
pioneers
of
the
past
and
the
pioneers
of
the
present
and
a
poignant
graphic
reminder
that
men
and
women
had
endured
storm
and
discomfort
and
disaster
for
decades
as
we
were
enduring
them
now
and
as
people
would
continue
to
endure
them
as
long
as
the
land
remained
to
be
conquered
one
morning
after
the
hardest
snowstorm
i
had
seen
i
awoke
in
the
print
shop
to
find
myself
corralled
by
snowdrifts
which
the
wind
had
driven
up
over
the
windows
and
four
or
five
feet
high
in
front
of
the
door
i
could
barely
see
over
the
top
of
the
upper
panes
that
was
friday
until
sunday
i
waited
cut
off
from
the
world
wondering
about
ida
mary
if
she
were
alone
in
that
shack
what
chance
would
she
have
was
she
cold
and
frightened
with
the
snow
piled
in
mountainous
drifts
she
would
be
as
inexorably
cut
off
from
help
as
though
she
were
alone
on
the
plains
the
things
that
happen
to
the
people
one
loves
are
so
much
worse
than
the
ones
that
happen
to
ourselves
but
the
things
that
may
happen
are
a
nightmare
as
the
hours
dragged
on
i
paced
up
and
down
the
print
shop
partly
because
being
hemmed
in
made
me
restless
partly
to
keep
warm
wondering
whether
the
neighbors
would
remember
that
ida
mary
was
alone
fearing
that
they
might
think
she
was
in
mcclure
with
me
on
sunday
a
passage
was
dug
from
the
print
shop
so
that
i
could
get
out
not
a
path
so
much
as
a
canyon
between
the
walls
of
snow
and
a
neighbor
with
a
covered
wagon
offered
to
take
me
home
or
to
try
to
he
drove
a
big
heavy
draft
team
the
horses
floundered
and
stuck
and
fell
plunged
out
of
one
drift
into
another
galen
got
out
and
shoveled
ahead
while
i
drove
resting
the
horses
after
each
plunge
the
ravines
we
skirted
and
finally
got
up
onto
the
ridge
it
was
when
we
arrived
and
already
the
skies
were
closing
in
gray
upon
the
white
plains
the
canvas
of
the
wagon
and
the
team
almost
the
same
color
blended
into
the
drab
picture
darker
shadows
against
the
gray
curtain
of
earth
and
sky
until
we
came
to
the
shack
the
dunns
had
remembered
as
they
so
often
did
that
ida
mary
was
alone
and
they
had
shoveled
a
path
to
the
door
for
her
and
she
was
safe
waiting
tranquilly
until
it
would
be
possible
to
return
to
the
school
again
in
such
weather
the
school
remained
closed
as
there
was
no
way
for
the
children
to
reach
it
through
the
deep
drifts
without
the
risk
of
freezing
to
death
with
ida
mary
safe
in
the
covered
wagon
we
started
back
at
once
to
mcclure
having
broken
the
drifts
on
the
first
trip
it
was
not
hard
going
but
it
was
midnight
when
we
reached
the
print
shop
on
cold
bad
days
the
dunns
getting
their
own
children
home
from
school
would
see
to
it
that
ida
mary
got
back
safely
and
dunn
would
insist
that
she
stay
with
them
on
such
nights
now
you
go
huey
and
bring
teacher
back
tell
her
the
trapdoor
is
down
so
the
attic
will
be
warm
for
her
and
the
children
to
sleep
and
when
she
came
dunn
would
say
with
that
clear
jolly
laugh
of
hers
now
if
expecting
imbert
miller
he
can
come
right
on
over
which
he
did
imbert
miller
was
a
young
native
westerner
whose
family
had
been
ranchers
out
there
for
a
good
many
years
he
was
a
young
man
who
had
been
attracted
to
ida
mary
from
the
beginning
and
whatever
her
own
feelings
for
him
she
liked
claim
life
a
lot
better
after
she
met
him
all
during
that
bitter
winter
imbert
came
over
every
sunday
dressed
in
neat
blue
serge
and
white
collar
some
of
the
settlers
said
that
was
how
they
could
tell
when
sunday
came
seeing
imbert
ride
by
dressed
up
like
that
he
dropped
in
sometimes
through
the
week
in
clean
blue
shirt
and
corduroys
for
an
evening
of
cards
or
reading
or
talking
in
fact
the
evenings
were
no
longer
lonely
as
they
had
been
at
first
nor
were
we
always
exhausted
we
were
young
and
demanded
some
fun
and
feminine
enough
to
find
life
more
interesting
when
the
young
men
who
were
homesteading
began
to
gather
at
the
shack
in
little
groups
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
getting
any
place
in
the
winter
and
the
distances
which
had
to
be
traveled
the
young
people
began
to
see
a
lot
of
each
other
the
romances
which
naturally
developed
made
the
winter
less
desolate
sometimes
we
would
gather
at
wilomene
for
supper
honey
served
with
flaky
hot
biscuits
baked
in
one
of
the
very
few
real
cookstoves
to
be
found
on
a
homestead
wilomene
had
a
big
shack
with
blue
paper
on
the
wall
and
a
real
range
instead
of
a
monkey
stove
with
a
drum
set
up
in
the
stovepipe
for
an
oven
not
many
settlers
could
boast
even
a
drum
and
always
the
supper
was
seasoned
with
wilomene
laughter
in
fair
weather
i
printed
both
back
and
front
pages
of
the
paper
and
in
storms
when
ink
and
machinery
froze
up
another
complication
in
dealing
with
the
press
i
printed
the
front
page
only
with
headlines
that
rivaled
the
big
dailies
there
was
no
news
to
warrant
them
but
they
were
a
dance
at
mcclure
would
do
for
a
scarehead
i
put
in
the
legal
notices
whatever
news
items
i
had
handy
or
had
time
to
set
up
and
stuck
in
boilerplate
as
a
filler
i
could
not
count
the
times
i
used
the
same
plate
over
but
the
settlers
did
mind
reading
it
again
they
had
little
else
to
do
in
midwinter
one
day
there
came
an
indistinct
message
over
the
telephone
line
which
consisted
mainly
of
fences
saying
that
the
railroads
were
blocked
by
storm
and
the
stages
were
delayed
i
threw
down
my
mallet
and
went
home
there
would
be
nothing
on
which
to
print
the
paper
on
the
first
stage
to
get
through
four
or
five
days
later
there
was
a
note
from
the
proof
king
do
not
fail
to
publish
last
week
paper
properly
dated
along
with
the
current
issue
as
long
as
there
was
one
proof
notice
running
the
newspaper
could
not
skip
a
single
week
when
the
two
editions
were
printed
i
went
home
very
during
the
course
of
a
busy
and
eventful
life
i
have
managed
perhaps
i
should
say
happened
to
be
a
many
times
and
always
i
have
had
a
frail
body
which
seemed
bent
on
collapsing
at
the
wrong
time
robust
health
i
have
always
coveted
but
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
not
an
essential
in
getting
things
done
and
i
have
learned
to
ignore
as
far
as
possible
my
lack
of
physical
endurance
the
widow
fergus
came
over
and
waited
on
me
all
night
using
her
simple
home
remedies
it
cost
at
least
to
get
a
doctor
out
there
and
many
times
the
emergency
was
over
one
way
or
the
other
before
he
arrived
homesteaders
could
not
afford
to
call
a
doctor
except
in
critical
cases
and
they
relied
for
the
most
part
upon
the
amateur
knowledge
and
help
of
their
neighbors
from
the
beginning
cooperation
had
been
one
of
the
strongest
elements
in
western
life
when
no
foundation
for
a
civilized
life
has
been
laid
when
every
man
must
start
at
the
beginning
in
providing
himself
with
such
basic
necessities
as
food
and
shelter
when
water
holes
are
few
and
far
between
and
water
to
sustain
life
must
be
carried
many
miles
men
have
to
depend
on
each
other
only
together
could
the
western
settlers
have
stood
at
all
alone
they
would
have
perished
in
times
of
sickness
and
individual
disaster
it
was
the
community
that
came
to
the
rescue
if
only
for
it
had
to
the
next
time
the
prints
were
held
up
by
a
storm
i
bought
a
roll
of
wrapping
paper
at
randall
store
cut
it
into
strips
and
got
the
paper
out
when
i
took
the
papers
into
the
post
office
to
mail
randall
laughed
out
loud
but
randall
said
reassuringly
that
right
miss
ammons
learning
to
meet
emergencies
in
this
country
is
a
valuable
thing
the
king
wrote
it
is
regrettable
that
a
paper
like
that
should
go
into
the
government
land
offices
such
an
outlaw
printer
i
replied
cheerfully
oh
i
sent
the
land
officials
a
good
one
they
can
read
every
number
and
printers
were
not
to
be
found
on
every
meantime
while
i
was
hammering
the
paper
into
shape
ida
mary
had
settled
the
doubts
of
the
homesteaders
who
feared
that
a
slight
young
city
girl
could
not
handle
a
frontier
school
she
was
a
good
teacher
she
had
a
way
of
discipline
with
the
plains
boys
who
were
larger
and
stronger
than
she
and
who
but
for
her
serene
firmness
would
have
refused
to
accept
her
authority
instead
they
arrived
early
to
build
the
fire
for
her
in
the
mornings
carried
the
heavy
pails
of
drinking
water
and
responded
eagerly
to
her
teaching
by
means
of
the
school
she
began
to
create
a
new
community
interest
another
and
perhaps
the
biggest
factor
in
the
community
life
of
that
section
was
the
randall
settlement
at
mcclure
the
randalls
threw
up
a
crude
shell
of
a
building
for
a
community
hall
and
now
and
then
gave
a
party
or
a
dance
for
the
homesteaders
typical
of
the
complete
democracy
of
the
plains
everyone
was
invited
and
everyone
young
and
old
came
the
parents
put
their
children
to
bed
in
the
lodge
quarters
of
the
halfway
house
while
they
joined
in
the
festivity
the
older
ones
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
we
younger
ones
waltzed
and
polkaed
in
a
long
line
down
the
outside
ring
it
was
not
always
easy
to
get
music
for
both
round
and
square
dances
at
the
same
time
but
old
joe
a
fiddler
ever
since
the
custer
battle
was
it
would
strike
one
bar
in
waltz
time
and
the
next
in
rhythm
to
the
allemande
left
of
the
square
dances
and
we
got
along
beautifully
some
of
the
homesteaders
helped
out
with
guitars
a
few
cowboys
riding
in
from
remote
ranches
played
accompaniments
on
other
cow
punchers
contributed
to
the
music
as
they
danced
with
clicking
of
spurs
and
clatter
of
boots
and
always
the
randalls
had
a
big
kettle
of
coffee
to
serve
with
the
box
lunches
the
guests
provided
for
themselves
at
christmas
ida
mary
and
i
were
invited
by
the
millers
for
a
house
party
it
was
the
first
home
we
had
seen
since
we
reached
south
dakota
a
small
farm
house
plainly
furnished
but
it
had
been
a
home
for
a
long
time
the
millers
were
counted
a
little
above
the
average
westerner
in
their
method
of
living
stockmen
on
a
small
scale
they
ran
several
hundred
head
of
cattle
miller
was
a
dignified
reserved
woman
who
maintained
shiny
order
in
her
house
she
even
scalds
her
dishes
folks
said
which
by
the
populace
was
considered
unpardonable
aristocracy
imbert
was
the
pride
and
mainstay
of
his
parents
there
were
warm
fires
clean
soft
beds
and
a
real
christmas
dinner
there
was
and
with
jingling
bells
behind
a
prancing
team
with
imbert
and
ida
mary
sitting
together
as
imbert
drove
imbert
devotion
to
ida
was
casually
accepted
by
the
prairie
folk
they
all
knew
him
a
likable
steady
young
fellow
who
seemed
to
have
a
way
with
the
girls
homestead
girls
came
and
went
and
flirtations
to
break
the
monotony
while
they
stayed
were
nothing
unusual
but
when
imbert
paid
for
the
teacher
box
at
a
held
at
the
schoolhouse
one
night
the
gaped
it
looked
they
said
as
if
that
little
tenderfoot
teacher
had
imbert
miller
lariated
it
beat
thunder
how
the
western
fellows
did
fall
for
eastern
schoolmarms
ten
dollars
for
a
shoe
box
without
knowing
what
there
was
in
it
most
of
the
bachelor
homesteaders
bought
boxes
with
a
view
to
what
they
would
get
to
eat
potato
salad
and
homemade
cake
because
we
were
no
longer
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
loneliness
ida
and
i
came
to
love
best
of
all
the
evenings
at
home
in
the
tiny
shack
with
its
gay
cushions
and
bright
curtains
we
enjoyed
the
good
hot
supper
of
spuds
and
bacon
or
rabbit
which
some
neighbor
had
brought
hot
biscuits
chokecherry
jelly
and
coffee
simmering
gently
on
the
back
of
the
stove
such
a
feast
however
was
only
on
rare
occasions
after
supper
with
the
world
shut
out
we
read
the
mail
from
home
done
so
well
girls
i
proud
of
you
our
father
wrote
i
be
looking
to
see
you
home
next
spring
i
believe
ida
mary
was
happier
that
winter
than
she
had
ever
been
and
her
work
was
easier
for
her
than
mine
for
me
with
fewer
hardships
thanks
to
the
dunns
and
to
imbert
who
did
much
to
make
it
easier
for
her
during
that
whole
winter
the
randalls
were
the
mainstay
of
the
community
they
were
one
of
those
families
who
are
the
backbone
of
the
old
west
always
ready
to
serve
their
neighbors
they
were
like
old
trees
standing
alone
on
the
prairie
that
have
weathered
the
storms
and
grown
strong
with
their
sheltering
branches
outspread
when
there
were
signs
of
a
blizzard
in
the
air
it
was
the
randalls
who
sent
out
their
sleighs
to
round
up
the
women
who
lived
alone
and
bring
them
in
to
shelter
when
a
doctor
was
needed
the
randalls
got
one
young
layton
was
having
her
first
baby
sooner
than
she
expected
it
was
a
black
night
twenty
below
zero
the
makeshift
telephone
line
was
out
of
order
as
it
usually
was
when
it
was
needed
randall
called
his
sons
you
have
to
go
for
doc
newman
yes
i
know
it
a
bad
trip
but
you
boys
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourselves
make
it
if
you
can
and
they
rode
it
seemed
to
me
there
never
was
a
time
when
at
least
one
of
the
randalls
was
riding
horseback
over
the
prairie
with
an
urgent
message
or
errand
for
the
homesteaders
pay
hell
no
were
these
newcomers
funny
i
remember
one
evening
in
january
with
a
storm
raging
i
had
run
to
the
randalls
house
from
the
print
shop
they
sent
the
sleigh
to
pick
up
ida
mary
and
wilomene
by
dark
half
a
dozen
men
were
marooned
at
the
halfway
house
three
of
them
strangers
passing
through
three
of
them
plainsmen
unable
to
get
home
a
little
later
two
homestead
women
who
had
come
in
from
pierre
on
the
stage
and
could
not
go
on
joined
us
somehow
there
was
room
for
all
of
them
in
the
big
living
room
chairs
with
an
odd
assortment
of
cushions
were
scattered
over
the
room
crude
tables
were
set
here
and
there
each
with
a
lamp
by
the
light
from
the
brightly
polished
chimneys
some
read
newspapers
more
than
a
week
old
others
looked
hungrily
through
the
catalogs
which
always
piled
up
in
country
post
offices
and
wilomene
white
telling
some
of
her
homestead
anecdotes
filled
the
room
with
laughter
her
most
harassing
experiences
seemed
funny
to
wilomene
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
big
heating
stove
stoked
with
coal
grew
red
hot
as
the
wind
howled
and
whistled
down
the
chimney
and
the
snow
lashed
against
the
windows
of
the
old
log
house
opening
off
one
end
of
the
long
room
were
the
small
cubicles
that
served
as
bedrooms
where
the
women
guests
would
sleep
crowded
together
two
or
three
in
a
bed
cots
would
be
put
up
in
the
living
room
for
the
randall
young
ones
but
the
strangers
leave
that
to
the
randalls
always
room
for
a
few
more
do
you
know
said
randall
i
am
never
happier
than
on
a
night
like
this
sitting
around
the
fire
knowing
my
family
are
all
here
and
safe
and
that
strangers
from
out
of
the
storm
have
found
shelter
under
my
roof
when
the
weather
grew
milder
and
i
could
ride
back
and
forth
again
almost
daily
it
was
randall
who
had
one
of
the
boys
on
the
ranch
wrangle
me
a
range
pony
which
he
said
was
broke
to
ride
he
broke
to
ride
the
only
difficulty
was
to
mount
him
it
was
all
right
once
one
got
on
his
back
but
only
an
expert
bronco
buster
could
do
it
every
time
i
set
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
went
up
in
the
air
pitched
and
bucked
and
i
could
draw
a
week
as
a
printer
and
waste
my
time
on
an
outlaw
bronc
so
i
solved
it
by
tying
him
short
with
a
heavy
lariat
to
the
corner
post
of
the
hay
barn
so
that
he
could
not
get
his
head
up
or
down
nor
his
heels
up
very
far
then
i
gave
one
leap
into
the
saddle
ida
cut
the
rope
close
to
his
neck
and
away
we
went
to
the
print
shop
where
i
wrestled
with
the
old
press
fortunately
there
was
no
trick
to
dismounting
although
i
always
expected
the
worst
one
day
i
broke
loose
i
had
worked
all
morning
and
used
up
half
a
can
of
grease
on
the
press
and
still
it
stuck
i
picked
up
a
hammer
and
tried
to
break
it
to
pieces
i
threw
one
piece
of
battered
equipment
after
another
across
the
prairie
do
go
near
the
print
shop
a
little
randall
boy
warned
all
comers
the
printer
i
scrubbed
the
ink
from
my
hands
and
face
and
boarded
the
stage
i
was
off
to
presho
to
meet
the
king
senn
was
a
magnate
in
the
frontier
newspaper
field
his
career
is
particularly
interesting
because
it
is
in
more
ways
than
one
typical
of
the
qualities
which
made
many
western
men
successful
basically
he
was
a
reformer
a
man
who
backed
with
every
means
at
his
command
and
great
personal
courage
the
issues
he
believed
for
the
good
of
the
country
and
fought
with
equal
intensity
those
which
were
harmful
in
the
early
nineties
he
had
moved
out
to
a
homestead
and
started
a
small
cattle
ranch
in
itself
that
was
a
daring
gesture
as
outlaw
gangs
cattle
rustlers
and
horse
thieves
infested
the
region
and
had
become
so
bold
and
influential
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
any
settlers
to
take
up
land
in
it
he
started
his
first
newspaper
on
his
homestead
miles
from
a
post
office
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
his
fight
with
the
cattle
thieves
in
retaliation
the
outlaws
burned
him
out
senn
promptly
moved
his
paper
to
the
nearest
post
office
at
a
small
crossroads
station
to
continue
the
fight
he
incorporated
in
this
paper
final
proof
notices
for
the
settlers
when
the
fight
with
the
rustlers
had
been
waged
to
a
successful
close
he
expanded
his
business
now
he
owned
the
greatest
monopoly
that
ever
operated
in
the
west
with
a
chain
of
papers
strung
over
that
part
of
south
dakota
as
civilization
pushed
into
a
new
district
the
king
picked
up
another
printing
outfit
and
made
entry
to
the
post
office
department
at
washington
of
another
newspaper
sometimes
he
moved
his
own
outfits
from
one
region
to
another
but
often
he
merely
shut
the
door
on
an
old
plant
not
worth
moving
and
let
it
return
to
while
the
print
shop
tumbled
down
with
it
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
he
used
to
complain
with
investments
depreciating
like
that
and
the
proof
business
so
when
the
settlers
filled
a
section
and
all
proved
up
at
once
and
he
had
to
run
a
paper
a
year
before
it
became
a
legal
publication
but
the
proof
sheets
soon
became
gold
mines
the
plants
costing
but
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
the
expenses
of
operating
only
ten
to
fifteen
dollars
a
week
a
cheap
printer
the
prints
the
ink
established
at
inland
post
offices
they
became
the
nuclei
for
crossroad
trading
points
at
this
time
he
had
embarked
on
another
cause
prohibition
which
was
causing
great
excitement
in
south
dakota
a
few
years
later
with
his
proof
sheets
extending
through
the
black
hills
he
bought
a
newspaper
in
deadwood
the
notorious
old
mining
town
which
is
usually
associated
in
people
minds
with
the
more
lurid
aspects
of
the
wild
west
he
found
conditions
all
that
they
had
been
painted
dominated
by
underworld
vice
rings
with
saloons
for
its
population
of
and
gambling
halls
operated
as
openly
as
grocery
stores
running
hours
a
day
even
the
two
dance
halls
exceeded
all
that
has
been
written
about
similar
places
with
his
newspaper
as
his
only
weapon
senn
set
out
to
clean
up
deadwood
in
the
fight
he
sunk
his
own
profits
until
he
had
to
sell
most
of
his
newspapers
emerging
from
it
almost
penniless
it
was
this
doughty
warrior
whose
printing
press
i
had
strewn
widely
over
the
prairie
when
he
entered
the
hotel
in
presho
where
i
was
awaiting
him
my
courage
almost
failed
me
he
was
wise
enough
not
to
ask
me
what
was
wrong
he
must
have
been
secretly
amused
by
the
very
small
frightened
girl
with
the
determined
expression
in
her
direct
blue
eyes
to
my
surprise
he
asked
no
questions
instead
he
took
me
to
supper
and
then
to
a
moving
picture
the
first
i
had
seen
in
the
west
his
kindness
so
melted
my
exasperation
with
the
press
that
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
begin
the
fighting
talk
i
had
come
to
make
but
the
film
ended
with
a
woman
driving
sheepmen
off
her
claim
and
with
that
example
to
fortify
my
ebbing
courage
i
asked
for
a
new
printing
press
and
i
got
it
the
new
press
was
a
one
but
in
comparison
to
the
ark
model
it
was
a
mechanical
wonder
i
did
not
know
that
the
proof
king
was
facing
a
financial
crisis
at
that
time
but
i
always
thought
the
blow
of
having
to
buy
a
press
was
not
half
so
bad
as
the
shock
of
having
a
printer
who
would
ask
for
one
while
i
was
enjoying
the
new
press
one
day
the
reeds
came
by
mcclure
well
folks
oh
are
you
going
yes
proved
up
going
back
to
god
country
god
country
to
the
reeds
was
missouri
to
others
it
was
illinois
or
iowa
or
ohio
day
after
day
homesteaders
left
with
their
final
receipt
as
title
to
their
land
pending
issuance
of
a
government
patent
throwing
back
the
type
of
the
dead
notices
i
could
almost
tell
who
would
be
pulling
out
of
the
country
going
back
in
time
to
get
in
the
spring
crop
farmers
would
say
land
grabbers
they
were
called
taking
acres
of
land
with
them
and
leaving
nothing
most
of
them
never
came
back
and
while
this
exodus
was
taking
place
here
and
there
a
settler
was
drifting
onto
the
lower
brulé
a
lucky
number
who
had
come
ahead
of
time
there
was
so
much
to
do
getting
settled
and
by
these
restless
signs
of
change
over
the
plains
we
knew
that
it
was
spring
and
one
week
i
set
up
for
the
paper
notice
is
hereby
given
that
ida
mary
ammons
has
filed
her
intention
to
make
proof
illustration
vi
utopia
with
the
first
tang
of
spring
in
the
air
we
cleaned
the
shack
put
up
fresh
curtains
and
did
a
little
baking
then
we
grew
reckless
and
went
into
an
orgy
of
extravagance
we
took
a
bath
in
the
washtub
wash
basins
were
more
commensurate
with
the
water
supply
then
we
scrubbed
the
floor
with
the
bath
water
in
one
way
and
another
the
settlers
managed
to
develop
a
million
square
miles
of
frontier
dirt
without
a
bathtub
on
it
for
the
first
time
we
stopped
to
take
stock
to
look
ahead
for
months
there
had
been
time
and
energy
for
nothing
but
getting
through
the
winter
we
had
been
too
busy
to
discuss
any
plans
beyond
the
proving
up
what
are
we
going
to
do
after
we
prove
up
i
asked
and
ida
mary
shook
her
head
i
do
know
she
admitted
in
some
ways
it
was
a
relief
to
have
the
end
in
sight
i
hated
the
minute
routine
of
putting
a
paper
together
with
one
letter
of
type
at
a
time
i
hated
the
hard
mechanical
work
most
of
our
neighbors
were
proving
up
going
back
but
we
realized
with
a
little
shock
of
surprise
that
we
did
not
want
to
go
back
imperceptibly
we
had
come
to
identify
ourselves
with
the
west
we
were
a
part
of
its
life
it
was
a
part
of
us
its
hardships
were
more
than
compensated
for
by
its
unshackled
freedom
to
go
back
now
would
be
to
make
a
painful
readjustment
to
city
life
it
would
mean
hunting
jobs
being
tied
to
the
weariness
of
office
routine
the
opportunities
for
a
full
and
active
life
were
infinitely
greater
here
on
the
prairie
there
was
a
pleasant
glow
of
possession
in
knowing
that
the
land
beneath
our
feet
was
ours
for
a
little
while
we
faced
uncertainly
the
problem
that
other
homesteaders
were
facing
that
of
going
back
of
trying
to
fit
ourselves
in
again
to
city
ways
but
the
eagerness
to
return
to
city
life
had
gone
then
too
there
was
something
in
the
invigorating
winter
air
and
bright
sunshine
which
had
given
me
new
resistance
there
had
been
a
continuous
round
of
going
down
and
coming
back
with
a
second
wind
but
i
had
gained
a
little
each
time
and
was
stronger
now
than
before
in
the
after
our
orgy
of
spring
with
everything
fresh
and
clean
ida
mary
said
someone
is
coming
straight
across
our
land
who
is
it
i
asked
we
had
learned
to
recognize
every
horse
in
that
part
of
the
country
a
mile
away
but
this
was
not
a
plainsman
we
rushed
into
the
shack
and
made
a
mad
scramble
through
the
trunk
but
before
we
could
get
dressed
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
will
you
wait
a
moment
please
i
called
it
was
the
custom
of
the
plains
for
a
man
to
wait
outside
while
his
hostess
dressed
or
put
her
house
in
order
there
being
no
corner
where
he
could
stay
during
the
process
if
the
weather
prohibited
outdoor
waiting
he
could
retire
to
the
hayshed
a
pleasant
voice
said
i
be
glad
to
wait
but
as
i
whispered
throw
me
those
slippers
and
ida
mary
said
what
dress
shall
i
wear
we
heard
a
muffled
chuckle
through
the
thin
walls
when
we
threw
open
the
door
to
a
slightly
built
man
with
brown
hair
and
a
polished
air
about
him
i
knew
it
was
the
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
only
a
city
man
and
an
artist
could
look
like
that
how
do
you
do
van
leshout
how
did
you
know
he
said
as
he
came
in
so
you
were
a
lucky
number
after
all
seemed
a
more
appropriate
response
than
telling
him
that
it
was
spring
and
something
had
been
bound
to
happen
something
like
the
arrival
of
a
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
are
you
going
to
be
a
settler
ida
mary
asked
doubtfully
he
laughed
yes
he
had
taken
a
homestead
close
to
the
sioux
settlement
so
that
he
could
paint
some
indian
pictures
odd
how
we
kept
forgetting
the
indians
but
up
to
now
we
had
even
seen
one
nor
were
we
likely
to
we
thought
barricaded
as
they
were
in
their
own
settlement
but
they
are
wonderful
he
assured
us
enthusiastically
magnificent
people
to
paint
old
seamed
faces
and
some
really
beautiful
young
ones
character
too
and
glamor
we
invited
him
to
tea
but
he
explained
that
he
must
get
back
to
his
claim
before
dark
it
was
already
too
late
imbert
told
him
he
would
have
to
wait
for
the
moon
to
rise
imbert
had
dropped
in
as
he
had
a
habit
of
doing
and
seeing
him
through
the
eyes
of
an
easterner
we
realized
what
fascination
the
lives
of
these
plainsmen
had
for
city
men
in
honor
of
the
occasion
we
got
out
the
china
cups
a
wanton
luxury
on
the
plains
and
tea
and
cake
as
they
rode
off
van
leshout
called
to
us
come
over
to
the
shack
i
built
it
myself
you
know
it
by
the
crepe
on
the
door
as
the
two
men
melted
into
the
darkness
we
closed
the
door
reluctantly
against
the
soft
spring
air
strange
that
we
had
found
prairie
life
dull
one
morning
soon
after
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
milwaukee
cartoonist
i
awoke
to
find
the
prairie
in
blossom
only
in
the
spring
is
there
color
over
that
great
expanse
but
for
a
few
weeks
the
grass
is
green
and
the
wild
flowers
bloom
in
delicate
beauty
anemones
tiny
white
and
yellow
and
pink
blossoms
wherever
the
eye
rests
i
galloped
to
the
print
shop
with
the
wind
blowing
through
my
hair
rejoicing
in
the
sudden
beauty
and
found
myself
too
much
in
holiday
mood
to
get
to
work
suddenly
i
looked
up
from
the
type
case
to
find
an
arresting
figure
in
the
doorway
a
man
with
an
air
of
power
and
authority
about
him
i
waiting
for
the
stage
he
said
may
i
come
in
i
offered
him
the
only
chair
there
was
an
upturned
nail
keg
and
he
sat
down
where
do
you
come
from
he
asked
abruptly
louis
i
said
but
why
come
out
here
to
run
a
newspaper
i
did
i
came
to
homestead
with
my
sister
but
the
job
was
here
because
he
was
amused
at
the
idea
because
the
function
of
these
frontier
papers
seemed
unimportant
to
him
i
began
to
argue
the
point
and
finally
thoroughly
aroused
described
the
possibilities
which
grew
in
my
own
mind
as
i
discussed
them
there
was
a
tremendous
job
for
the
frontier
newspaper
to
do
i
pointed
out
did
he
know
the
extent
of
this
great
homestead
movement
and
the
future
it
promised
true
the
frontier
papers
were
small
in
size
but
they
could
become
a
power
in
the
development
of
this
raw
country
how
he
demanded
i
think
i
fully
realized
it
for
the
first
time
myself
then
as
a
medium
of
cooperation
i
told
him
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
hands
in
pockets
and
looked
out
over
the
prairie
then
he
turned
around
but
the
development
of
this
country
is
a
gigantic
enterprise
he
protested
it
would
require
the
backing
of
corporations
and
millions
of
dollars
in
fact
it
too
big
for
any
organization
but
the
government
to
tackle
it
no
job
for
a
woman
his
eyes
twinkled
as
he
contrasted
my
diminutive
size
with
the
great
expanse
of
undeveloped
plains
what
could
you
do
of
course
it
big
i
admitted
and
the
settlers
do
need
lots
of
money
but
they
need
cooperation
too
their
own
strength
acting
together
counts
more
than
you
know
and
a
newspaper
could
be
made
a
voice
for
these
people
utopian
he
decided
bill
appeared
at
the
door
to
tell
him
that
the
stage
has
been
ten
minutes
now
he
handed
me
his
card
shook
hands
and
rushed
out
i
looked
at
the
card
halbert
donovan
and
company
brokers
investment
bankers
new
york
city
the
fact
that
such
men
were
coming
into
the
country
looking
it
over
presaged
development
not
only
the
eyes
of
the
landseekers
but
those
of
industry
and
finance
were
turning
west
i
stared
after
the
stagecoach
until
it
was
swallowed
up
in
distance
my
own
phrases
kept
coming
back
to
me
there
was
a
job
to
be
done
a
job
for
a
frontier
newspaper
and
soon
the
mcclure
would
be
a
thing
of
the
past
as
soon
as
the
homesteaders
had
made
proof
slowly
an
idea
was
taking
shape
i
slammed
the
door
shut
mounted
pinto
and
loped
home
i
turned
the
horse
loose
to
graze
and
walked
into
the
shack
with
my
back
against
the
door
in
a
defensive
attitude
i
said
abruptly
i
going
to
start
a
newspaper
on
the
reservation
ida
mary
slowly
put
down
the
bread
knife
but
where
are
you
going
to
get
the
money
she
asked
practically
i
do
know
yet
i
have
to
plan
what
to
do
first
do
i
and
then
look
around
for
a
way
to
do
it
that
was
the
formula
followed
day
after
day
by
the
settlers
it
too
bad
you
did
register
for
a
claim
in
the
drawing
she
said
thoughtfully
after
all
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
have
a
claim
too
i
could
still
get
a
homestead
on
the
brulé
i
declared
and
i
can
run
the
newspaper
on
the
homestead
the
more
we
discussed
the
plan
the
more
ida
mary
liked
the
idea
of
moving
to
the
strip
where
so
many
new
people
would
be
coming
we
would
work
together
we
planned
and
the
influence
of
the
newspaper
would
radiate
all
over
the
reservation
but
it
occurred
to
us
coming
abruptly
down
to
earth
with
no
roads
or
telephones
or
mail
service
how
were
the
settlers
to
receive
the
radiation
this
was
a
stickler
but
having
gone
so
far
with
our
plans
we
were
reluctant
to
abandon
them
where
there
was
a
newspaper
there
should
be
a
post
office
then
we
would
start
a
post
office
through
it
the
land
notices
would
be
received
and
the
newspaper
mailed
to
the
subscribers
the
settlers
could
get
the
paper
and
their
mail
at
the
same
place
we
decided
that
ida
mary
would
run
it
somehow
it
did
not
occur
to
us
that
the
government
has
something
to
say
about
post
offices
and
who
shall
run
them
or
that
the
government
might
not
want
to
put
a
post
office
on
my
homestead
just
to
be
obliging
but
once
a
person
has
learned
to
master
difficulties
as
they
come
up
he
begins
to
feel
he
can
handle
anything
so
ida
took
her
final
proof
receipt
to
a
loan
office
in
presho
how
much
can
i
borrow
on
this
she
asked
handing
it
to
the
agent
oh
about
eight
hundred
dollars
that
is
enough
most
homesteaders
are
getting
a
loan
when
they
prove
up
yes
but
your
land
a
mile
long
and
only
a
quarter
wide
ida
mary
was
not
easily
bluffed
she
reached
for
the
receipt
i
try
sedgwick
at
the
bank
we
make
it
nine
hundred
the
agent
said
but
not
a
cent
more
i
know
that
quarter
section
it
pretty
rough
homesteading
was
no
longer
a
precarious
venture
a
homesteader
could
borrow
on
almost
any
in
the
west
more
on
good
land
well
located
it
was
a
criminal
offense
to
sell
or
mortgage
government
land
but
who
could
wait
six
months
or
a
year
for
the
government
to
issue
a
patent
deed
to
the
land
many
of
the
settlers
must
borrow
money
to
make
proof
so
the
homestead
loan
business
became
a
performance
the
homesteader
could
not
get
this
receipt
of
title
until
he
paid
the
land
office
for
the
land
and
he
could
not
pay
for
the
land
until
he
had
the
receipt
to
turn
over
to
the
loan
agent
so
it
was
all
done
simultaneously
money
mortgages
receipts
like
juggling
half
a
dozen
balls
in
the
air
at
once
it
was
one
of
the
most
ingenious
methods
of
finance
in
operation
banks
and
loan
companies
went
into
operation
to
handle
homestead
loans
and
eastern
capital
began
flowing
in
for
the
purpose
being
familiar
with
land
office
procedure
from
my
work
on
the
mcclure
i
knew
that
not
every
winner
of
a
claim
on
the
lower
brulé
reservation
would
come
to
prove
it
up
a
few
of
them
would
relinquish
their
rights
the
buying
and
selling
of
relinquishments
in
fact
became
a
big
business
for
the
land
agents
there
was
a
mad
rush
for
relinquishments
on
the
strip
where
landseekers
were
paying
as
high
as
to
for
the
right
to
file
on
a
claim
i
wanted
a
relinquishment
on
the
reservation
in
the
very
center
of
it
and
i
found
one
for
then
i
made
a
deal
with
a
printing
equipment
firm
for
a
small
plant
a
new
one
and
although
there
were
only
a
dozen
settlers
or
so
on
the
land
i
pledged
proof
notices
as
collateral
these
proofs
at
apiece
were
as
sure
as
government
bonds
that
is
if
the
settlers
on
the
brulé
stayed
long
enough
to
prove
up
if
the
newspaper
lived
and
if
no
one
else
started
a
paper
in
competition
but
on
that
score
the
printers
supply
company
was
satisfied
its
officers
thought
there
was
no
danger
of
anyone
else
trailing
an
outfit
into
that
region
we
arranged
for
straight
credit
on
lumber
for
a
print
shop
there
being
nothing
left
to
mortgage
from
now
on
we
were
dealing
in
futures
in
just
two
short
weeks
i
had
become
a
reckless
plunger
aided
and
abetted
by
ida
mary
the
whole
west
was
gambling
on
the
homesteaders
making
good
long
we
hesitated
over
the
letter
home
telling
of
our
new
plans
under
the
new
laws
one
must
stay
on
a
claim
fourteen
months
instead
of
the
eight
months
required
when
ida
mary
had
filed
at
last
we
wrote
to
explain
that
we
were
not
coming
home
this
spring
we
were
going
on
to
a
new
frontier
earnestly
as
we
believed
in
the
plans
we
had
made
it
was
hard
to
make
that
letter
carry
our
convictions
difficult
to
explain
the
logic
of
our
moving
to
an
indian
reservation
so
that
ida
mary
could
run
a
post
office
in
order
to
mail
copies
of
a
newspaper
to
settlers
looking
at
it
like
that
we
were
acting
in
blind
faith
and
one
day
a
funny
little
caravan
made
its
way
across
the
prairie
breaking
a
new
trail
as
it
went
a
shack
with
a
team
hitched
to
it
a
wagon
loaded
with
immigrant
goods
and
a
printing
press
ahead
leading
the
way
a
girl
on
horseback
again
it
was
huey
dunn
who
jacked
up
our
old
shack
that
morning
when
the
term
of
school
was
over
and
put
it
on
wheels
for
the
trip
to
the
reservation
twelve
miles
around
by
mcclure
a
few
miles
closer
by
a
across
the
plains
huey
decided
on
the
latter
way
and
i
rode
on
ahead
to
see
that
the
load
of
printing
equipment
should
be
put
on
the
right
while
ida
mary
came
in
the
shack
she
sat
in
the
rocking
chair
gazing
placidly
out
of
the
window
as
it
made
its
way
slowly
across
the
plains
we
had
hired
two
homesteaders
to
haul
out
lumber
and
put
up
a
small
building
for
the
newspaper
and
post
office
although
we
had
not
yet
got
the
necessary
petition
signed
for
a
post
office
we
could
not
do
that
before
the
settlers
arrived
a
small
shed
room
was
built
a
few
feet
from
the
business
structure
as
a
for
our
migratory
shack
when
i
arrived
at
the
claim
the
men
who
had
hauled
out
the
load
of
equipment
were
gone
suddenly
there
came
on
one
of
those
torrential
downpours
that
often
deluge
the
dry
plains
in
spring
it
was
pitch
black
as
night
came
on
and
no
sight
of
huey
and
ida
mary
the
rain
stopped
at
length
throwing
on
a
sweater
i
paced
back
and
forth
through
the
dripping
grass
listening
for
the
sound
of
the
horses
at
last
i
went
back
and
crouched
over
the
fire
in
the
little
waiting
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
at
midnight
huey
arrived
with
the
shack
he
and
ida
mary
were
cold
and
wet
and
hungry
they
had
not
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
early
morning
just
as
they
had
reached
cedar
creek
usually
a
little
dry
furrow
in
the
earth
a
flood
of
water
came
rushing
in
a
torrent
making
a
mad
swollen
stream
that
spread
rapidly
and
they
were
caught
in
it
when
they
got
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
the
shack
began
to
fill
with
water
huey
grabbed
ida
mary
and
got
her
on
one
horse
while
he
mounted
the
other
and
the
horses
swam
to
land
the
next
morning
the
sun
came
out
flooding
the
plains
it
was
a
different
world
from
the
harsh
drab
prairie
to
which
we
had
come
eight
months
ago
here
the
earth
was
a
soft
green
carpet
heavily
sprinkled
with
spring
flowers
white
and
lavender
hyacinths
bluebells
blossoms
flaming
red
yellow
and
blue
and
waxen
flowers
that
wither
at
the
touch
and
yet
bloom
on
the
hard
desert
huey
dunn
squared
the
migratory
shack
and
rolled
the
wheels
from
under
and
there
in
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
the
indians
name
for
the
brulé
i
filed
my
claim
and
started
a
newspaper
the
only
woman
so
it
was
recorded
ever
to
establish
a
newspaper
on
an
indian
reservation
and
if
one
were
to
pick
up
the
first
issues
of
that
newspaper
he
would
see
under
the
publisher
name
published
on
section
township
north
range
of
the
principal
meridian
the
only
way
of
describing
its
location
ida
claim
had
seemed
to
us
at
first
sight
to
be
in
the
midst
of
nowhere
compared
to
this
it
had
been
in
a
flourishing
neighborhood
for
here
there
was
nothing
but
the
land
waiting
no
sign
of
habitation
no
living
thing
yes
an
antelope
standing
rigid
against
the
horizon
for
a
terrified
moment
it
seemed
that
there
could
be
no
future
here
only
time
and
ida
mary
and
i
shrank
from
two
very
confident
young
women
to
two
very
young
and
frightened
girls
but
there
was
work
to
be
done
our
cabin
sat
parallel
to
and
perhaps
ten
feet
from
the
print
shop
a
crude
store
building
feet
which
we
called
the
brulé
business
block
we
had
a
side
door
put
on
near
the
back
end
of
each
building
so
that
we
could
slip
easily
from
house
to
shop
we
did
a
little
remodeling
of
our
old
shack
befitting
our
new
position
as
business
leaders
we
built
a
kitchen
onto
the
back
of
the
shack
and
a
clothes
closet
in
one
end
of
it
we
even
bought
a
little
cookstove
with
an
oven
in
it
one
morning
we
saw
a
team
and
wagon
angling
across
the
strip
toward
our
place
upon
the
top
of
the
wagon
there
perched
a
high
rectangular
object
a
thing
bobbing
up
and
down
as
the
wagon
jolted
over
the
rough
ground
it
was
harvey
with
the
outhouse
there
was
nothing
left
now
on
ida
mary
claim
but
the
mortgage
confronted
suddenly
by
so
many
problems
of
getting
started
i
stood
just
plumb
flabbergasted
as
coyote
cal
a
cowpuncher
always
remarked
when
unexpectedly
confronted
by
a
group
of
women
and
yet
i
knew
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
had
known
since
the
day
i
heard
myself
telling
the
new
york
broker
an
obscure
little
newspaper
in
a
desolate
homestead
country
but
given
courage
enough
that
little
printing
outfit
would
be
a
tool
a
voice
for
the
people
needs
it
was
a
gigantic
task
this
taming
of
the
frontier
and
meantime
getting
down
to
reality
i
had
a
newspaper
without
a
country
without
a
living
thing
but
prairie
dogs
and
rattlesnakes
to
read
it
and
around
us
a
hundred
thousand
acres
on
which
no
furrow
had
ever
been
turned
we
did
not
know
where
to
begin
there
was
a
piece
of
kindling
wood
on
the
whole
reservation
we
had
brought
what
food
and
water
we
could
with
us
food
fuel
water
those
were
basic
problems
that
had
to
be
met
and
then
within
a
week
almost
imperceptibly
a
change
began
to
come
over
the
reservation
the
lucky
numbers
were
coming
onto
the
land
on
the
claim
to
the
west
a
house
went
up
and
wagons
of
immigrant
goods
were
unloaded
ida
mary
rode
over
one
evening
and
found
that
our
new
neighbor
was
a
farmer
christopher
christopherson
from
minnesota
he
had
brought
plows
and
work
horses
and
was
ready
to
break
sod
another
example
of
the
farmers
who
were
leaving
the
settled
states
for
cheap
land
farther
west
christopherson
was
a
thrifty
swedish
farm
woman
who
would
manage
well
there
was
a
big
family
of
children
and
each
child
old
enough
to
work
was
given
work
to
do
around
us
new
settlers
were
arriving
daily
and
we
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
start
out
among
them
with
our
petition
with
pinto
as
our
only
means
of
transportation
it
proved
to
be
a
slow
job
one
day
dropping
suddenly
down
off
the
tableland
into
a
draw
i
came
squarely
upon
a
shack
i
rode
up
and
an
old
man
invited
me
in
his
wife
a
woman
appeared
to
me
much
younger
than
he
i
explained
my
errand
for
mercy
sake
the
woman
said
here
you
are
starting
a
post
office
and
i
thought
you
was
one
of
them
city
homesteaders
a
around
listen
to
that
pa
a
post
office
in
four
miles
of
us
the
woman
put
out
a
clean
cup
and
plate
set
up
she
said
we
signing
any
petition
till
you
had
your
dinner
there
plenty
of
biscuit
i
stirred
up
an
extry
cup
of
flour
and
i
said
to
pa
be
et
i
ate
salt
pork
biscuit
and
sorghum
while
she
talked
so
you
going
to
handle
newspapers
too
oh
print
one
she
sighed
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
pestiferous
job
we
going
to
have
a
newspaper
out
here
pa
did
you
ever
pa
never
did
where
had
i
seen
these
two
old
people
before
and
heard
this
woman
talk
where
you
from
she
asked
but
before
i
could
answer
she
went
on
we
from
blue
springs
pa
wrote
david
wagor
on
the
petition
one
morning
imbert
miller
came
with
his
team
and
buggy
to
take
us
out
into
a
more
remote
district
to
get
signers
we
found
two
or
three
farmers
a
couple
of
business
men
with
their
families
and
several
young
bachelors
each
building
the
regular
shack
they
were
surprised
and
elated
over
the
prospect
of
a
post
office
after
wandering
over
a
long
vacant
stretch
imbert
began
to
look
for
a
place
where
he
could
feed
the
horses
and
get
us
some
food
at
last
we
saw
bright
new
lumber
glistening
in
the
sun
as
we
drove
up
to
the
crudely
built
cabin
we
saw
an
emblem
painted
on
the
front
a
big
black
circle
with
the
letter
v
in
it
and
underneath
the
word
rancho
standing
before
the
open
doorway
was
an
easel
with
a
indian
head
on
it
van
leshout
ida
mary
exclaimed
he
came
out
unshaven
and
sweeping
an
old
hat
from
his
head
with
a
low
bow
it
been
years
since
i
saw
a
human
being
he
exclaimed
you
want
grub
building
a
cabin
learning
to
prepare
his
own
meals
getting
accustomed
to
solitude
were
new
experiences
for
the
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
not
many
courses
he
said
as
he
dragged
the
spuds
out
from
under
the
bunk
just
two
potatoes
first
course
flapjacks
and
second
course
and
coffee
you
discovered
the
indians
we
said
pointing
to
the
canvas
the
indians
yes
but
they
had
been
much
of
a
cure
for
loneliness
what
were
we
doing
on
the
reservation
we
brought
out
the
petition
and
told
him
about
the
newspaper
i
explained
that
i
had
filed
on
a
claim
on
the
reservation
i
looked
for
the
crepe
on
the
door
as
we
drove
up
i
told
him
you
have
a
claim
on
the
reservation
to
hell
with
the
crepe
he
said
in
high
spirits
on
the
road
home
seeing
imbert
elation
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
never
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
imbert
miller
lived
near
the
borders
of
the
reservation
and
that
the
fence
would
not
separate
him
from
ida
mary
now
how
deeply
she
had
weighed
the
question
i
did
not
know
we
sent
in
the
petition
and
the
federal
authorities
promptly
established
a
post
office
for
the
lower
brulé
on
my
homestead
and
appointed
ida
mary
postmistress
she
was
the
only
woman
ever
to
run
a
post
office
on
an
indian
reservation
the
data
gatherers
said
the
government
named
it
ammons
so
we
had
a
postmistress
and
a
post
office
with
its
tiers
of
empty
homemade
pigeonholes
ready
to
receive
the
mail
and
we
discovered
there
was
no
way
to
get
any
mail
in
or
out
illustration
vii
building
empires
overnight
that
spring
i
saw
a
country
grow
perhaps
rome
was
built
in
a
day
but
the
brulé
was
almost
the
incredible
speed
of
the
transformation
of
the
untouched
plains
the
invasion
of
the
settlers
in
droves
lighting
on
the
prairies
like
grasshoppers
the
appearance
morning
after
morning
of
new
shacks
as
though
they
had
sprung
up
overnight
the
sound
of
hammers
echoing
through
the
clear
light
air
plows
at
last
tearing
at
the
unbroken
ground
the
wonder
of
it
leaves
me
staggered
now
but
then
i
was
caught
up
in
the
breathless
rush
the
mad
activity
to
get
things
done
the
lucky
numbers
were
coming
coming
a
few
weeks
before
we
had
set
up
our
shack
in
a
wilderness
now
there
were
shacks
everywhere
and
frantic
activity
the
plains
had
come
to
life
over
them
where
there
had
been
bleak
emptiness
loomed
tents
white
against
the
green
background
where
the
settlers
could
sleep
until
they
were
able
to
build
houses
there
was
no
time
to
rest
no
time
to
pause
here
where
there
had
been
nothing
but
time
late
one
evening
a
wagon
loaded
with
immigrant
goods
and
a
shabby
car
loaded
with
children
passed
our
place
the
drivers
stopped
on
a
nearby
claim
threw
their
bedding
on
the
ground
and
slept
there
their
deadline
for
establishing
residence
was
up
that
night
all
over
the
plains
that
intensive
race
went
on
the
hurried
arrival
of
settlers
before
their
time
should
expire
the
hasty
throwing
up
of
shelter
against
the
weather
the
race
to
plant
crops
in
the
untamed
soil
so
that
there
would
be
food
later
on
a
land
where
one
must
begin
at
the
beginning
everything
to
be
done
and
things
crying
to
be
done
all
at
once
those
three
basic
needs
food
fuel
water
problems
which
must
be
solved
without
delay
moving
in
a
network
in
every
direction
wagons
and
teams
hauled
in
immigrant
goods
lumber
and
machinery
fence
posts
and
fuel
post
holes
supplemented
those
dug
by
the
prairie
dogs
strings
of
ran
threadlike
over
the
unbroken
stretch
from
day
to
day
we
saw
the
prairie
change
saw
new
crude
houses
thrown
up
saw
the
first
furrows
broken
in
the
stubborn
soil
saw
men
and
women
pit
themselves
against
the
frontier
and
shape
it
to
their
purpose
and
their
needs
among
these
people
there
were
many
more
dirt
farmers
than
had
settled
around
mcclure
but
at
least
per
cent
of
the
immigrants
were
young
men
and
women
from
various
walks
of
life
business
and
professions
who
had
come
for
health
or
adventure
or
because
the
land
through
sale
or
mortgage
would
give
them
a
start
in
life
while
it
is
doubtless
true
that
these
latter
contributed
little
to
the
permanent
building
of
the
west
the
zest
with
which
they
enjoyed
its
advantages
the
gallantry
with
which
they
faced
its
hardships
contributed
no
small
part
to
increasing
the
morale
of
the
settlers
as
a
whole
almost
every
settler
scooped
out
a
dam
at
the
foot
of
a
slope
for
water
supply
we
had
chris
christopherson
plow
one
for
us
these
dams
were
nothing
but
waterholes
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
and
two
or
three
feet
deep
there
should
be
late
spring
rains
to
fill
them
for
the
summer
there
were
while
the
settlers
were
still
plowing
and
planting
and
making
their
dams
it
began
to
rain
and
when
the
frontier
is
wet
it
wet
all
over
dry
creeks
swelled
to
overflowing
and
small
ravines
became
creeks
and
it
kept
on
raining
both
ida
mary
and
i
were
caught
in
one
of
those
downpours
and
had
to
swim
the
horses
across
cedar
creek
much
of
those
first
days
were
like
chapters
from
genesis
and
to
add
to
the
similarity
we
now
had
the
flood
the
seed
shot
out
of
the
ground
and
the
fields
were
green
the
gardens
grew
like
jack
beanstalk
the
thick
grass
stood
a
foot
high
and
the
dams
were
full
of
water
and
ida
mary
and
i
were
literally
in
the
center
of
this
maze
of
activity
this
mushroom
growth
of
a
country
and
ammons
was
actually
on
the
map
my
sister
wrote
to
the
postal
department
for
a
mail
carrier
and
found
out
she
would
have
to
solve
that
problem
for
herself
we
are
cut
out
to
cope
with
the
plains
i
said
how
did
you
happen
to
find
that
out
asked
ida
mary
i
did
a
new
york
broker
told
me
we
had
to
find
some
way
to
get
mail
in
and
out
we
could
back
up
on
the
trail
once
we
had
started
there
was
no
place
to
back
to
so
we
bought
a
team
and
started
a
mail
route
hauling
mail
three
times
a
week
from
the
stage
line
at
mcclure
it
was
the
thing
that
had
to
be
done
but
sometimes
when
we
had
a
moment
for
reflection
we
were
a
little
aghast
carrying
a
mail
route
in
homestead
country
was
a
far
cry
from
life
in
louis
it
began
to
seem
as
though
we
rarely
acted
according
to
plan
out
here
rather
we
were
acted
upon
by
unforeseen
factors
so
that
our
activities
were
constantly
shifting
taking
on
new
form
leading
in
new
directions
the
only
consistent
thing
about
them
was
that
they
never
now
and
then
we
hired
boys
to
help
us
with
heavy
jobs
which
were
beyond
our
strength
and
occasionally
a
young
prairie
girl
ada
long
fourteen
years
old
went
for
the
mail
it
was
against
the
law
to
let
anyone
who
happened
to
be
handy
carry
the
mail
but
the
settlers
had
to
have
postal
service
ada
was
fair
with
long
yellow
braids
strong
and
accustomed
to
the
hard
ways
of
the
prairie
she
could
hitch
up
a
team
and
drive
it
like
a
man
there
was
only
one
drawback
to
ada
on
saturday
when
we
were
busiest
she
went
home
and
to
church
and
on
sunday
she
hung
out
the
washing
ada
was
a
loyal
adventist
settlers
meeting
on
the
trail
hailed
one
another
with
hello
where
you
from
i
from
illinois
or
virginia
or
iowa
you
breakin
they
had
no
time
for
backgrounds
it
did
matter
what
the
newcomers
might
have
been
that
was
left
beyond
the
reservation
gate
one
standing
was
measured
by
what
he
could
do
and
what
kind
of
neighbor
he
would
make
and
always
the
question
where
you
from
missouri
michigan
wisconsin
bronco
benny
riding
through
one
day
said
i
never
seen
so
many
gals
in
my
life
must
be
a
trainload
of
some
pretty
fillies
among
too
bronco
benny
knew
no
other
language
than
that
of
the
horse
world
in
which
he
lived
not
only
dirt
farmers
but
many
others
became
sodbreakers
the
sod
was
heavy
and
with
the
great
growth
of
grass
it
took
all
the
strength
of
man
and
teams
four
to
six
horses
hitched
to
a
plow
to
turn
it
steady
slow
furrow
by
furrow
man
and
beast
dripping
with
sweat
they
broke
fields
of
the
virgin
earth
how
deep
to
plow
how
to
cultivate
this
land
few
of
them
knew
the
more
experienced
farmers
around
the
strip
like
huey
dunn
would
know
here
was
a
service
the
newspaper
could
perform
by
printing
such
information
for
the
newcomers
subscriptions
for
the
paper
began
coming
in
before
we
were
ready
to
print
it
we
named
it
reservation
and
how
it
ever
was
accepted
in
that
man
country
with
a
name
like
that
is
beyond
me
the
first
issue
was
distributed
by
homesteaders
passing
by
and
two
carriers
subscriptions
came
in
rapidly
at
a
dollar
a
year
not
only
did
most
of
the
settlers
subscribe
but
they
put
in
subscriptions
for
friends
and
relatives
so
that
these
might
know
something
of
the
country
and
its
activities
and
in
their
rush
of
getting
settled
it
was
easier
to
have
the
printer
set
up
the
news
and
run
it
off
on
a
press
than
to
take
the
time
to
write
a
letter
outsiders
could
not
send
in
subscriptions
by
mail
until
the
newspaper
had
an
address
other
than
a
section
number
of
the
claim
on
which
it
was
printed
food
shelter
fuel
were
still
the
pressing
problems
an
army
had
peopled
a
land
without
provisions
trade
was
overwhelmed
and
the
small
towns
could
not
get
supplies
shipped
in
fast
enough
new
business
enterprises
were
following
this
rush
as
lightning
does
a
lightning
rod
there
was
bedlam
one
could
not
get
a
plowshare
sharpened
a
bolt
or
a
bushel
of
coal
without
making
the
long
trip
to
town
one
could
not
get
a
pound
of
coffee
or
a
box
of
matches
on
the
whole
reservation
the
settlers
began
to
clamor
for
a
store
in
connection
with
the
newspaper
and
the
post
office
their
needs
ran
more
to
coffee
and
sugar
and
nails
than
to
newspapers
they
had
to
have
a
store
for
a
few
essential
commodities
at
least
a
store
i
objected
strenuously
we
had
already
embarked
on
enough
enterprises
and
running
a
store
had
no
place
among
them
but
practical
ida
was
really
interested
in
the
project
it
was
such
a
bad
idea
she
decided
our
money
was
dwindling
the
newspaper
would
not
become
a
paying
proposition
for
some
time
and
the
only
revenue
from
the
post
office
was
the
meager
cancellation
of
stamps
we
could
hire
the
hauling
done
she
pointed
out
grappling
at
once
with
the
details
and
it
would
be
a
real
service
to
the
settlers
that
was
what
we
had
wanted
to
provide
the
means
did
matter
so
much
so
we
planked
down
a
cash
payment
at
a
store
at
presho
for
a
bill
of
goods
got
credit
for
the
rest
of
it
threw
up
an
ell
addition
on
the
back
of
the
shop
for
the
newspaper
and
stuck
a
grocery
store
where
the
newspaper
had
been
all
this
time
we
had
been
so
submerged
in
activities
connected
with
getting
settled
starting
and
operating
a
newspaper
a
post
office
and
now
a
store
that
we
had
overlooked
a
rather
important
point
that
on
an
indian
reservation
one
might
reasonably
expect
indians
we
had
forgotten
the
indians
and
one
afternoon
they
came
on
horseback
and
in
wagons
war
bonnets
and
full
regalia
glittering
in
the
sun
the
indians
were
coming
straight
toward
the
ammons
settlement
neither
of
us
had
ever
seen
an
indian
outside
of
a
wild
west
show
we
were
terrified
into
the
shack
we
scurried
locked
doors
and
windows
and
peeped
out
through
a
crack
in
the
drawn
blind
the
indians
had
stopped
and
turned
their
horses
loose
to
graze
we
could
hear
them
walking
around
the
store
and
print
shop
and
then
came
savage
mutterings
outside
our
door
and
heavy
pounding
we
crawled
under
the
bed
a
woman
we
knew
had
escaped
being
scalped
once
by
hiding
behind
a
shock
of
corn
but
there
was
no
such
refuge
here
how
how
kill
an
old
indian
was
bellowing
no
use
trying
to
escape
this
was
the
end
trembling
hearts
pounding
we
opened
the
door
two
big
creatures
with
battered
faces
stood
there
motioning
toward
the
shop
where
a
group
of
them
were
sauntering
in
and
out
how
kill
they
still
muttered
dazed
we
followed
them
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
shop
women
were
sitting
on
the
floor
some
with
papooses
strapped
to
their
backs
men
with
hair
hanging
loose
or
braided
down
their
backs
tied
with
red
string
were
picking
up
everything
in
the
print
shop
playing
like
children
with
new
toys
they
led
us
into
the
store
muttering
as
they
pointed
to
the
shelves
at
last
we
found
they
wanted
sugar
and
tobacco
and
we
lost
no
time
in
filling
the
order
at
sunset
they
rode
away
toward
the
indian
settlement
and
we
discovered
that
we
had
been
misled
by
the
talk
of
segregation
to
us
that
had
meant
that
the
indians
were
behind
some
high
barricade
but
there
a
thing
to
separate
us
from
the
tribe
but
another
fence
with
the
gates
down
for
several
days
after
the
red
men
came
we
moved
in
a
nightmare
of
fear
the
sioux
had
cherished
this
tall
grass
country
as
a
hunting
ground
and
we
had
invaded
it
suppose
they
were
intent
upon
revenge
then
absorbed
in
our
many
duties
we
almost
forgot
about
the
indians
but
a
week
after
their
first
visit
they
came
again
they
arrived
shortly
before
sundown
adorned
in
beads
and
feathers
stopped
across
the
trail
and
to
our
horror
pitched
camp
pinto
commenced
to
neigh
and
kept
it
up
a
restless
whinny
eager
for
his
own
people
it
looked
as
though
the
whole
sioux
tribe
had
moved
over
to
ammons
while
the
men
unhitched
and
unsaddled
the
squaws
for
the
most
part
large
shapeless
creatures
totally
unlike
the
slim
indian
maid
of
fiction
and
indescribably
dirty
started
small
fires
with
twigs
they
had
brought
with
them
by
now
ma
wagor
the
woman
from
blue
springs
was
in
the
store
every
day
helping
out
and
she
was
as
terrified
as
ida
and
i
it
seems
there
were
no
indians
in
blue
springs
they
were
among
the
few
contingencies
for
which
ma
wagor
was
not
amply
prepared
by
chance
a
strange
cowboy
came
through
about
sundown
and
stopped
for
a
package
of
tobacco
while
he
dexterously
rolled
a
cigarette
with
one
hand
we
surrounded
him
three
women
did
he
think
the
indians
were
on
the
war
path
we
asked
our
teeth
chattering
oh
i
do
know
he
answered
carelessly
ca
tell
a
speck
about
an
indian
could
blame
could
you
with
these
landgrabbers
their
range
the
logic
of
this
had
already
occurred
to
us
and
we
were
not
particularly
cheered
by
the
cowboy
confirmation
of
our
worst
suspicions
what
do
you
suppose
they
buildin
them
fires
for
ma
wagor
was
anxious
to
know
sourdough
could
say
as
to
that
but
he
it
might
be
to
burn
the
scalps
in
at
that
we
missed
ma
she
had
slipped
into
the
house
to
wash
her
feet
ma
was
a
great
believer
in
preparedness
whether
having
something
cooked
ahead
for
supper
or
clean
feet
for
heaven
instinctively
i
put
my
hand
on
my
shock
of
fair
hair
to
make
sure
it
was
still
in
place
it
had
always
been
a
nuisance
but
now
i
felt
a
passionate
eagerness
to
keep
it
where
it
was
the
indians
stretched
their
tepees
and
cooked
their
supper
the
prairie
around
them
was
alive
with
bony
horses
and
dogs
it
was
the
impatient
yelping
of
the
dogs
about
the
kettles
rather
than
any
sounds
from
the
indians
which
we
heard
the
cowboy
threw
his
cigarette
on
the
floor
stamped
on
it
with
a
jingle
of
spurs
and
drawled
guess
i
be
percolatin
got
to
ride
ma
wagor
grabbed
him
by
his
wide
belt
you
goin
to
do
your
right
in
front
of
this
shack
she
declared
grimly
you
got
your
pistol
and
we
women
need
protection
looking
at
set
jaw
he
promised
to
hang
around
that
night
locked
in
the
shack
we
waited
for
the
cowboy
signal
of
attack
shoot
down
as
fast
as
they
crossed
the
trail
he
assured
us
but
we
were
not
so
confident
of
his
prowess
i
send
for
pa
ma
wagor
said
dismally
but
what
good
would
he
do
and
one
of
us
has
got
to
be
left
to
prove
up
the
claim
it
was
unlikely
according
to
ma
that
anyone
in
that
cabin
would
survive
but
as
the
night
wore
on
everything
across
the
trail
became
quiet
and
at
last
we
threw
ourselves
across
the
bed
exhausted
we
woke
next
morning
to
find
our
cowboy
gone
and
the
indians
cooking
breakfast
two
men
with
hair
hanging
loose
over
their
shoulders
and
faces
painted
in
red
and
copper
hues
led
a
horse
up
to
the
door
and
walked
into
the
store
they
pointed
to
the
shelves
held
up
ten
fingers
then
pointed
to
the
horse
they
wanted
to
trade
it
for
ten
dollars
worth
of
groceries
ida
mary
did
not
bother
to
look
at
the
horse
she
traded
the
last
thing
that
would
have
occurred
to
her
at
that
moment
was
to
disagree
with
any
wishes
the
indians
might
express
we
found
out
later
that
the
old
mare
was
and
locoed
within
a
week
we
had
the
corral
full
of
horses
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
we
would
have
traded
the
whole
store
for
anything
that
the
indians
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
sourdough
who
belonged
to
the
scotty
phillips
outfit
over
on
the
indian
lands
had
ridden
straight
on
to
do
duty
every
cowpuncher
it
seemed
must
play
at
least
one
trick
on
the
tenderfeet
then
one
day
a
handsomely
built
young
buck
straight
as
an
arrow
walked
into
the
print
shop
how
kola
he
said
and
then
introduced
himself
as
joe
he
was
a
college
graduate
it
appeared
and
he
explained
that
how
kola
was
the
friendly
greeting
of
the
sioux
a
welcome
to
the
two
white
girls
who
ran
the
settlement
many
of
these
young
indians
went
east
to
indian
colleges
acquiring
along
with
their
education
a
knowledge
of
civilized
ways
to
which
they
adapted
themselves
with
amazing
rapidity
on
returning
to
the
reservations
however
in
many
cases
perhaps
in
most
they
discarded
one
by
one
as
though
they
had
never
been
the
ways
of
the
white
man
and
reverted
to
their
primitive
customs
and
ways
of
life
nor
should
they
be
too
thoughtlessly
condemned
for
it
among
civilized
peoples
the
same
urge
for
an
escape
from
responsibility
exists
thwarted
often
enough
merely
by
necessity
or
by
the
pressure
of
convention
and
public
opinion
the
indians
who
have
reverted
to
type
discarded
the
ways
of
civilization
for
a
tepee
and
primitive
uncleanliness
follow
the
path
of
least
resistance
traditions
of
accomplishment
as
we
know
them
have
no
meaning
for
the
indians
and
the
way
of
life
for
which
his
own
traditions
have
fitted
him
has
been
denied
him
how
kola
that
must
be
what
the
old
warrior
was
bellowing
the
day
we
thought
he
had
said
he
would
kill
us
old
laughed
at
that
when
his
son
joe
interpreted
it
in
sioux
old
explained
us
to
his
son
of
whom
he
was
manifestly
very
proud
he
pointed
to
me
then
to
ida
mary
thus
the
brulé
indians
distinguished
us
from
each
other
joe
had
come
as
a
sort
of
emissary
from
the
brulés
they
wanted
us
he
explained
to
make
ammons
an
indian
trading
post
looking
at
the
corral
we
felt
to
our
sorrow
that
they
had
already
done
so
joe
said
they
had
wood
and
berries
in
abundance
along
the
missouri
river
which
ran
through
the
indian
lands
they
wanted
to
exchange
them
for
merchandise
and
the
settlers
we
knew
needed
the
indian
commodities
so
to
the
newspaper
the
post
office
the
store
the
mail
route
the
heavy
hauling
we
added
an
indian
trading
post
trading
groceries
for
fence
posts
subscriptions
to
for
berries
very
few
of
them
could
read
it
but
they
did
mind
that
it
was
a
trade
joe
became
a
mediator
and
interpreter
until
ida
mary
and
i
learned
enough
of
the
sioux
language
to
carry
on
we
tried
to
figure
out
a
way
in
this
trading
to
make
back
our
loss
on
the
menagerie
we
had
collected
at
ammons
those
bare
store
shelves
worried
us
then
one
morning
the
old
blind
locoed
mare
turned
up
with
a
fine
colt
by
her
side
we
were
getting
even
and
we
no
longer
minded
that
the
gate
was
open
between
the
indian
lands
and
the
section
of
the
brulé
which
had
been
thrown
open
to
white
settlers
while
the
gate
stood
open
enmity
and
mutual
suspicion
could
not
exist
and
the
path
between
it
and
ammons
was
beaten
hard
and
smooth
the
indians
came
in
processions
with
loaded
wagons
unloaded
turned
their
horses
loose
on
the
range
and
sat
around
men
and
women
for
hours
at
a
time
on
floor
or
ground
dickering
ida
mary
became
as
expert
at
it
as
they
were
it
was
not
long
before
had
legal
work
from
them
the
settling
of
estates
notices
pertaining
to
land
affairs
etc
and
that
led
logically
enough
to
ida
mary
being
appointed
a
notary
public
want
to
sell
your
land
girls
a
man
from
presho
asked
us
one
day
that
what
i
drove
out
for
i
have
a
buyer
anxious
to
get
a
claim
on
the
brulé
and
i
believe
he
would
pay
for
this
relinquishment
a
quick
profit
sell
no
we
declared
with
such
demand
for
land
on
the
strip
we
may
be
able
to
get
for
it
when
it
is
proved
up
he
agreed
a
raw
of
deeded
land
just
outside
the
border
had
sold
the
other
day
for
he
informed
us
with
all
the
breaking
and
improvement
going
on
over
the
brulé
it
was
predicted
by
boosters
that
choice
homesteads
here
would
be
worth
to
in
another
year
or
so
after
the
land
was
deeded
within
sixty
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
first
lucky
number
on
his
claim
the
square
miles
of
the
brulé
would
be
filled
the
winners
had
filed
consecutively
so
many
numbers
each
day
for
that
length
of
time
their
time
to
establish
residence
would
thus
expire
accordingly
already
the
broad
expanse
of
grassland
we
had
seen
during
our
first
week
on
the
brulé
was
changed
beyond
recognition
shacks
everywhere
fields
plowed
movement
and
activity
the
frontier
had
receded
once
more
before
the
advancing
tide
of
civilization
within
sixty
days
with
the
price
of
claims
soaring
it
became
a
mecca
for
claim
jumpers
they
circled
around
ready
to
light
on
the
land
like
buzzards
on
a
carcass
they
watched
every
for
the
arrival
of
the
settler
if
he
were
not
on
his
land
by
dark
of
the
last
day
some
spotter
was
likely
to
jump
the
claim
and
next
morning
rush
to
the
land
office
and
slap
a
contest
on
it
they
were
unlike
the
claim
jumpers
of
the
older
pioneer
days
who
jumped
the
land
because
they
wanted
it
for
a
home
many
of
these
men
would
not
have
proved
up
a
claim
at
any
price
but
in
many
instances
they
brought
landseekers
with
them
who
legally
filed
contests
and
homesteading
rights
over
the
settler
they
paid
the
claim
jumpers
well
for
their
services
in
getting
hold
of
the
land
often
being
strangers
the
landseekers
did
not
know
that
these
spotters
were
not
land
agents
they
were
a
ruthless
lot
as
a
whole
these
claim
jumpers
they
took
long
chances
illegally
selling
relinquishments
and
skipping
the
country
before
they
were
caught
some
of
them
even
threatened
or
intimidated
newcomers
who
knew
nothing
about
the
west
or
its
land
laws
of
a
different
type
were
unscrupulous
locating
agents
who
used
the
technicalities
of
the
homestead
law
to
operate
the
despicable
contest
business
whether
they
had
any
grounds
for
contesting
a
homestead
or
not
they
could
claim
they
had
and
the
settler
must
then
either
go
to
trial
to
defend
his
rights
or
give
up
the
land
it
was
a
serious
problem
for
the
settlers
so
many
strangers
came
and
went
that
the
homesteaders
seldom
identified
these
land
thieves
but
the
print
shop
set
high
in
the
middle
of
the
plains
was
like
a
ranger
lookout
where
we
could
watch
their
maneuvers
they
traveled
in
rickety
cars
or
with
team
and
buggy
often
carrying
camping
equipment
with
them
by
the
way
they
drove
or
rode
back
and
forth
we
could
spot
the
spotters
they
often
stopped
at
the
settlement
for
tobacco
or
a
lunch
out
of
the
store
and
a
little
information
whose
shack
is
that
off
to
the
southwest
a
man
asked
one
morning
reading
off
the
claim
numbers
from
a
slip
of
paper
he
was
a
man
dressed
in
a
baggy
checkered
suit
with
a
heavy
gold
watch
chain
across
the
front
of
his
vest
and
a
big
flashy
ring
belongs
to
a
woman
from
missouri
ida
mary
told
him
she
had
a
neighbor
build
the
shack
for
her
no
one
living
there
he
said
oh
yes
ida
mary
improvised
rapidly
she
was
in
here
yesterday
on
the
way
to
town
for
furniture
wo
be
back
until
tomorrow
night
he
looked
doubtful
does
look
to
me
as
though
anyone
ever
slept
there
not
a
thing
in
the
shack
no
bed
ida
mary
called
out
to
me
edith
did
you
lend
that
woman
some
bedding
yesterday
yes
i
declared
so
she
could
sleep
there
a
few
nights
before
the
deadline
all
our
early
training
in
was
lost
in
the
skirmish
and
sometimes
i
doubted
if
the
truth
was
left
in
us
but
there
was
zest
in
this
outwitting
of
men
who
would
have
defrauded
the
settlers
if
they
could
one
day
i
noticed
two
men
driving
back
and
forth
over
a
vacant
claim
nearby
at
sundown
no
one
had
established
residence
i
watched
the
maneuvers
of
the
two
men
ida
i
called
those
men
are
going
to
jump
that
claim
i
looked
over
my
land
plat
and
saw
that
the
homestead
belonged
to
rosie
carrigan
from
ohio
it
was
the
last
day
of
grace
she
had
until
midnight
to
get
there
it
was
a
moonlight
night
ida
mary
saddled
pinto
and
rode
down
the
draw
toward
the
claim
from
a
slope
where
she
could
not
be
seen
she
watched
the
two
men
the
evening
wore
on
at
eleven
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
owner
had
failed
to
arrive
the
men
pitched
camp
ida
mary
rode
quietly
up
the
draw
and
galloped
up
to
the
cabin
they
are
sleeping
on
the
claim
she
said
breathlessly
this
meant
that
next
morning
as
soon
as
the
land
office
opened
one
of
them
would
be
there
to
slap
a
contest
on
the
land
while
the
other
held
possession
it
also
meant
that
when
rosie
carrigan
arrived
she
would
find
her
homestead
gone
what
shall
we
do
i
asked
anxiously
ida
mary
considered
for
a
moment
one
of
us
must
be
rosie
carrigan
she
decided
she
ran
out
to
hitch
the
team
to
the
wagon
while
i
hurriedly
dragged
a
few
things
out
of
the
house
and
loaded
them
things
such
as
an
immigrant
must
carry
with
him
bedding
boxes
a
traveling
bag
or
two
we
threw
them
in
the
wagon
circled
off
a
mile
or
two
and
then
drove
straight
back
onto
the
land
a
few
rods
from
the
we
drove
a
stake
hung
a
lantern
on
it
and
began
to
unhitch
shivering
with
excitement
and
apprehension
the
noise
of
our
arrival
roused
the
two
men
who
stirred
and
then
with
an
exclamation
got
to
their
feet
we
saw
the
flare
of
a
match
one
of
them
had
drawn
out
his
watch
and
was
looking
at
it
under
the
light
we
looked
at
ours
it
was
ten
minutes
to
twelve
we
heard
them
murmur
to
each
other
but
continued
unhitching
the
horses
dragging
the
hastily
assembled
articles
out
of
the
wagon
then
my
heart
began
to
pound
one
of
the
men
walked
over
to
us
he
was
short
burly
here
you
ca
stay
here
where
do
you
think
you
are
he
demanded
we
made
no
answer
but
the
bed
i
contrived
to
make
under
his
watching
eyes
was
a
hopeless
tangle
we
on
this
land
he
blustered
he
was
trying
to
run
a
bluff
to
find
out
whether
we
were
on
the
right
or
whether
like
him
we
were
i
guess
i
have
to
have
your
identification
he
said
again
your
name
rosie
carrigan
i
answered
from
ohio
what
are
you
doing
on
my
land
anyway
you
have
no
right
here
he
hesitated
weighing
the
situation
and
the
possibilities
get
off
i
blazed
at
him
he
got
the
two
men
rolled
up
their
bedding
and
moved
on
and
ida
mary
and
i
sat
limply
on
the
ground
watching
them
go
in
case
they
should
come
back
we
decided
to
hold
the
land
for
the
night
gathered
up
the
bedding
and
slept
in
the
wagon
when
we
slept
at
daybreak
we
were
wakened
by
the
rumble
of
a
wagon
coming
slowly
over
the
prairie
behind
a
limping
team
a
tall
slim
girl
and
a
slight
boy
sat
high
on
the
front
seat
they
drove
up
beside
our
wagon
fastened
on
the
back
of
their
load
was
a
chicken
coop
and
as
they
stopped
a
rooster
stuck
its
head
out
and
crowed
the
girl
was
rosie
carrigan
the
boy
was
her
brother
and
the
rooster
was
the
first
of
his
kind
to
settle
on
the
reservation
they
had
been
delayed
by
footsore
horses
but
no
no
one
except
ourselves
ever
knew
that
rosie
carrigan
did
not
establish
residence
at
ten
minutes
before
midnight
not
long
after
this
a
stranger
rode
up
to
an
old
shack
and
took
some
papers
out
of
his
pocket
there
some
mistake
here
pardner
he
said
looks
like
you
on
the
wrong
quarter
this
is
section
he
read
the
description
and
it
happens
to
be
mine
but
that
the
number
of
the
claim
i
filed
on
at
the
drawing
the
old
man
assured
him
after
much
arguing
and
bullying
with
the
old
man
contending
he
was
right
the
stranger
ordered
him
off
the
land
you
do
pull
that
stuff
on
me
pardner
you
better
vacate
now
keep
your
shirt
on
stranger
the
old
man
said
with
a
twitching
of
his
long
white
mustache
inviting
him
in
for
a
bite
to
eat
while
he
hunted
up
his
land
receipts
i
all
crippled
up
with
the
rheumatiz
he
groaned
as
he
hobbled
back
into
a
corner
of
the
room
to
get
the
papers
a
pore
way
for
the
to
open
up
land
i
says
now
down
in
the
oklahomy
run
we
used
speed
and
brains
to
stake
a
claim
beating
the
other
fellow
to
it
but
it
was
a
tough
bunch
down
there
and
sometimes
stranger
we
he
turned
and
pointed
a
gun
straight
at
the
man
seated
at
the
table
we
used
a
gun
the
old
man
who
had
stood
leaning
on
his
cane
at
the
drawing
complaining
that
neither
legs
nor
brains
counted
in
winning
a
claim
used
his
ingenuity
to
hold
one
during
those
last
days
of
settling
ida
mary
and
i
lived
in
a
state
of
tension
and
suspense
we
watched
our
land
plat
and
often
rode
out
over
the
prairie
to
watch
for
the
arrival
of
settlers
whose
land
was
being
spotted
after
a
few
of
our
deceptions
the
claim
jumpers
became
wary
of
the
newspaper
and
cursed
that
snip
of
a
newspaper
woman
and
the
girl
who
ran
the
post
office
was
a
government
employee
here
was
a
job
for
in
the
next
issue
there
appeared
a
article
it
began
it
has
been
reported
that
owing
to
the
swift
settlement
of
the
brulé
secret
service
agents
from
the
federal
land
department
are
being
sent
out
to
protect
the
settlers
against
claim
jumpers
who
are
said
to
be
nesting
there
this
tampering
with
government
lands
is
a
criminal
offense
and
it
is
understood
that
legal
action
will
be
pushed
against
all
offenders
one
afternoon
some
two
weeks
later
there
walked
into
the
print
shop
a
man
with
an
official
manner
about
him
he
called
for
the
publisher
of
the
paper
what
do
you
know
about
this
he
demanded
pointing
to
the
article
what
authority
did
you
have
for
it
i
was
speechless
he
was
a
federal
agent
well
i
said
at
last
defiantly
if
the
government
is
not
furnishing
agents
on
the
land
to
look
after
these
things
it
should
and
it
did
the
agent
looked
into
the
matter
quieted
down
there
were
fewer
spotters
swarming
around
and
soon
when
their
six
months
of
grace
had
expired
the
lucky
numbers
were
all
on
the
ground

benny
remarked
one
day
coming
in
under
the
wire
that
counts
ida
mary
and
i
had
saddled
ourselves
with
a
newspaper
a
post
office
a
grocery
store
an
indian
trading
post
and
all
the
heavy
labor
of
hauling
delivery
of
mail
and
odd
jobs
that
were
entailed
we
were
appalled
to
realize
the
weight
of
the
responsibility
we
had
assumed
with
every
job
making
steady
daily
demands
on
us
with
the
ammons
finances
to
be
juggled
and
stretched
to
cover
constant
demands
on
them
and
there
was
no
turning
back
the
lucky
numbers
were
all
settled
on
their
claims
already
trails
were
broken
to
the
print
shop
from
every
direction
there
was
no
time
to
plan
no
time
in
which
to
wonder
how
one
was
to
get
things
done
the
important
thing
was
to
keep
doing
them
on
the
whole
strip
there
was
not
a
vacant
already
a
long
beaten
trail
led
past
the
door
north
and
south
from
pierre
to
presho
another
crossed
the
reservation
east
and
west
from
mcclure
to
the
indian
tepees
and
the
rangeland
beyond
paths
led
in
from
all
parts
of
the
strip
like
spokes
with
ammons
the
hub
around
which
the
wheel
of
the
activities
revolved
from
every
section
of
the
settlement
the
people
gravitated
to
my
claim
they
came
with
their
needs
with
their
plans
with
their
questions
in
the
first
days
we
heard
their
needs
rather
than
filled
them
and
the
store
and
print
shop
became
a
place
for
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
news
so
that
i
was
able
to
distinguish
before
long
between
the
needs
of
the
individual
and
those
which
were
common
to
all
to
clarify
in
my
own
mind
the
problems
that
beset
the
settlers
as
a
whole
and
to
learn
how
some
among
them
solved
these
problems
subscriptions
for
came
in
from
the
outside
world
from
people
who
had
friends
homesteading
on
the
brulé
and
from
people
interested
in
the
growth
of
the
west
we
had
almost
a
thousand
subscriptions
at
a
dollar
a
year
and
the
money
went
into
a
team
equipment
and
operation
expenses
ma
wagor
helped
in
the
store
she
liked
the
confusement
she
said
she
loved
having
people
around
her
and
her
curiosity
about
them
all
was
insatiable
ida
or
i
generally
made
the
mail
trip
the
heavy
labor
we
hired
done
when
we
could
but
many
times
we
hitched
the
team
to
the
big
lumber
wagon
and
drove
to
presho
to
bring
out
our
own
load
of
goods
including
barrels
of
and
gasoline
for
automobiles
for
there
were
quite
a
few
cars
on
the
reservation
automobiles
in
fact
were
the
only
modern
convenience
in
the
lives
of
these
modern
pioneers
who
stepped
from
the
running
board
straight
back
into
the
conditions
of
days
the
needs
of
the
people
were
tremendous
and
insistent
and
the
needs
of
the
people
had
to
find
expression
in
some
way
if
they
were
to
be
met
the
print
shop
was
ready
was
ready
i
was
ready
the
only
hitch
was
that
i
could
operate
the
new
press
we
had
bought
because
we
could
put
it
together
ida
mary
and
i
labored
futilely
with
bolts
and
screws
and
other
iron
parts
for
two
days
i
had
sat
down
in
the
doorway
to
rest
exhausted
by
my
tussle
with
the
machinery
when
i
saw
a
man
coming
from
the
indian
settlement
he
appeared
against
the
horizon
as
if
he
had
ridden
out
of
the
ether
riding
slowly
straight
as
an
indian
but
as
he
came
closer
i
saw
he
was
a
white
man
at
the
door
he
dismounted
threw
the
reins
on
the
ground
and
walked
past
me
into
the
store
lifting
his
slouch
hat
as
he
entered
a
man
rather
short
of
stature
sturdy
with
a
jaw
and
flat
features
that
would
have
been
homely
had
they
not
been
so
strong
he
looked
with
surprise
through
the
open
door
of
the
print
shop
with
its
stalled
machinery
what
the
trouble
he
asked
i
explained
my
predicament
i
ca
put
the
thing
together
and
i
know
what
to
do
about
it
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
get
an
experienced
printer
out
here
to
start
it
for
me
he
smiled
broadly
walked
into
the
shop
and
without
a
word
fixed
the
forms
adjusted
the
press
and
turned
out
the
first
issue
of
that
newspaper
he
would
accept
no
pay
and
no
thanks
my
name
is
farraday
fred
farraday
he
said
i
ride
over
next
friday
and
help
you
get
the
paper
out
with
that
he
mounted
his
pony
and
rode
away
as
deliberately
as
he
had
come
every
friday
after
that
he
returned
to
help
print
the
paper
naturally
we
were
curious
about
the
man
who
had
solved
our
desperate
need
for
a
printer
in
so
surprising
a
way
but
fred
was
content
to
come
week
after
week
and
disappear
again
on
the
horizon
without
any
explanation
as
to
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
where
he
went
when
he
rode
out
of
sight
each
friday
we
tried
him
with
hints
with
bland
suppositions
with
questions
and
could
not
break
through
his
taciturnity
but
even
fred
had
no
defense
against
ma
wagor
curiosity
and
little
by
little
through
her
persistent
questioning
we
learned
that
he
had
a
homestead
near
the
agency
that
he
had
run
a
newspaper
in
the
northwest
and
that
he
had
been
connected
with
the
indian
service
the
business
of
the
newspaper
increased
rapidly
and
advertising
began
to
come
in
from
the
small
surrounding
towns
ma
wagor
was
kept
busy
in
the
store
selling
groceries
to
the
indians
who
camped
around
for
a
day
dickering
and
to
the
white
settlers
who
were
generally
in
a
hurry
so
little
time
so
much
to
do
ida
mary
helped
me
in
the
print
shop
and
before
long
we
found
we
needed
an
expert
typesetter
and
i
found
one
unlikely
as
it
may
seem
on
an
adjoining
claim
kathryn
slattery
tall
and
slim
and
preferred
setting
type
to
sitting
alone
in
her
shack
and
with
her
striking
appearance
as
an
added
attraction
the
popularity
of
the
settlement
with
the
young
men
homesteaders
mounted
in
this
odd
fashion
i
found
on
the
prairie
both
a
printer
and
a
typesetter
and
for
problems
of
format
for
there
was
always
the
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
late
one
afternoon
i
spied
a
strange
moving
object
in
the
far
distance
something
that
bobbed
up
and
down
with
the
regularity
of
a
clock
pendulum
i
asked
ida
mary
in
some
bewilderment
whether
she
could
identify
it
at
last
we
saw
it
was
a
quadruped
with
some
sort
of
on
top
bouncing
up
and
down
at
every
step
as
it
drew
closer
heading
for
the
shop
ida
mary
began
to
laugh
it
alexander
van
leshout
she
said
the
cartoonist
scrambled
down
from
his
mount
and
led
the
old
horse
up
to
the
door
i
would
have
called
sooner
he
explained
sweeping
off
his
hat
in
a
low
bow
but
i
have
been
breaking
in
my
new
steed
let
me
introduce
cassidy
it
was
the
newspaper
that
had
brought
him
he
went
on
to
say
editorially
it
not
so
bad
but
the
would
give
anyone
sore
eyes
it
was
van
leshout
who
helped
with
the
of
the
paper
and
he
made
drawings
and
had
plates
made
that
would
do
credit
to
any
newspaper
he
was
a
strange
character
in
this
setting
like
an
exotic
plant
in
an
garden
and
his
eccentricities
aroused
considerable
amusement
among
the
settlers
although
he
became
in
time
a
favorite
with
them
serving
as
a
sort
of
to
the
strain
of
pioneer
life
men
who
trudged
all
day
through
the
broiling
sun
turning
furrows
in
that
stubborn
soil
were
entertained
by
the
strange
antics
of
a
man
who
sat
before
his
cabin
in
the
shade
when
there
was
any
painting
the
indians
it
was
a
rare
treat
to
hear
him
go
on
they
admitted
but
he
was
not
to
be
taken
seriously
among
the
subscriptions
i
received
for
was
one
from
the
new
york
broker
halbert
donovan
with
a
letter
addressed
to
mcclure
through
the
mcclure
which
i
had
sent
me
it
read
i
learned
that
you
are
running
a
newspaper
out
on
some
indian
reservation
i
remember
quite
well
the
fantastic
idea
you
had
about
doing
things
out
there
with
a
little
newspaper
but
it
does
not
seem
possible
you
would
be
so
foolhardy
i
afraid
your
aspirations
are
going
to
receive
a
great
blow
it
is
a
poor
place
for
dreams
imagine
your
trying
to
be
a
voice
of
the
frontier
as
you
put
it
to
a
bunch
of
homesteaders
in
a
country
like
that
if
i
can
be
of
help
to
you
in
some
way
you
might
let
me
know
you
have
shown
a
progressive
spirit
too
bad
to
waste
it
what
i
needed
at
the
moment
was
to
have
him
send
me
a
few
corporations
but
as
that
was
unlikely
i
pinned
my
faith
in
it
was
a
paper
which
carried
staunchly
a
strange
load
of
problems
and
responsibilities
in
spite
of
the
new
york
broker
blunt
disbelief
in
the
possibilities
of
a
frontier
newspaper
i
had
become
more
and
more
convinced
during
those
weeks
that
only
through
some
such
medium
could
the
homesteaders
express
their
own
needs
in
their
own
way
have
their
problems
discussed
in
terms
of
their
own
immediate
situation
we
needed
herd
laws
and
a
hundred
other
laws
we
needed
new
land
rulings
we
needed
schools
bridges
across
draws
and
dry
creeks
we
needed
roads
in
fact
there
was
nothing
which
we
did
not
need
and
most
of
all
we
needed
a
sense
of
cooperation
aside
from
these
matters
of
general
interest
relating
to
their
common
welfare
the
paper
attempted
to
acquaint
the
settlers
with
one
another
to
inform
them
of
the
activities
going
on
about
them
to
keep
them
advised
of
frontier
conditions
to
assist
those
who
knew
nothing
of
farming
conditions
in
the
west
and
often
enough
those
who
had
never
farmed
before
i
reprinted
articles
on
western
soil
and
crops
and
on
the
conservation
of
moisture
every
week
there
were
noticeable
strides
in
that
incredible
country
toward
civilization
changes
and
improvements
these
were
printed
as
quickly
as
i
learned
of
them
not
only
because
of
the
encouragement
this
record
of
tangible
results
might
bring
the
homesteaders
but
also
as
a
means
of
information
for
people
in
the
east
who
still
did
not
know
what
we
were
doing
and
who
did
not
see
the
possibilities
of
the
land
and
already
in
depicting
the
homestead
movement
i
had
begun
to
realize
that
the
lower
brulé
was
only
a
fraction
of
what
was
to
come
and
i
reached
out
in
panoramic
scope
to
other
parts
of
the
frontier
and
already
though
but
dimly
i
had
begun
to
see
that
the
system
of
cooperation
which
was
being
attempted
cautiously
and
on
a
small
scale
was
the
logical
solution
for
the
farmer
problems
not
alone
in
this
homesteading
area
not
alone
on
the
lower
brulé
but
that
like
a
pebble
thrown
into
a
quiet
stream
it
must
make
circles
until
it
encompassed
the
farmers
throughout
the
west
perhaps
naturally
public
issues
sprang
up
which
neither
ida
mary
nor
i
knew
how
to
handle
we
knew
nothing
about
politics
nothing
at
all
about
the
proper
way
to
go
about
setting
things
right
but
we
were
a
jump
ahead
of
the
lower
brulé
settlers
in
homesteading
experience
and
there
were
many
local
issues
with
which
to
make
a
start
one
of
the
first
public
issues
the
paper
took
up
was
an
attack
on
the
railroad
company
in
regard
to
the
old
bridge
spanning
the
missouri
river
at
chamberlain
every
time
a
shower
comes
up
that
bridge
goes
out
declared
and
it
was
much
of
an
exaggeration
the
homesteaders
were
dependent
on
the
bridge
to
get
immigrant
goods
across
and
with
the
heavy
rains
that
season
many
settlers
had
been
delayed
in
getting
on
their
land
or
in
getting
their
crops
planted
in
time
referred
to
the
railroad
report
that
this
was
the
biggest
immigration
period
of
the
state
history
with
carloads
of
immigrant
goods
moved
in
during
the
first
twelve
days
of
the
month
for
several
years
the
small
towns
west
of
the
missouri
had
been
making
a
fight
for
a
new
bridge
the
lower
brulé
settlers
want
a
new
bridge
i
wrote
and
if
the
milwaukee
does
not
build
one
we
are
going
to
do
our
shipping
over
the
northwestern
regardless
of
longer
hauls
i
had
not
talked
this
matter
over
with
the
settlers
but
they
would
do
it
all
right
a
flea
attacking
an
elephant
but
a
flea
can
be
annoying
and
we
would
keep
it
up
i
was
encouraged
when
civic
leaders
of
several
small
towns
sent
for
copies
of
the
article
to
use
in
their
petitions
to
the
company
it
was
the
voice
of
the
lower
brulé
and
already
the
lower
brulé
bore
weight
in
practical
ways
the
paper
also
tried
to
serve
the
homesteaders
keeping
them
posted
on
other
frontier
regions
and
the
methods
employed
there
to
bring
the
land
into
production
it
made
a
study
of
crops
best
adapted
to
the
frontier
it
became
the
strip
bureau
of
information
and
a
medium
of
exchange
not
only
of
ideas
but
of
commodities
in
new
country
where
money
is
scarce
people
resort
from
necessity
to
the
primitive
method
of
barter
exchanging
food
for
fuel
labor
for
commodities
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
its
favor
and
it
solved
a
lot
of
problems
in
those
early
penniless
days
we
had
started
the
post
office
mainly
as
a
means
of
getting
the
newspaper
into
circulation
and
it
had
developed
into
a
difficult
business
of
its
own
which
required
more
and
more
of
ida
mary
time
friday
was
publication
day
on
thursday
we
printed
the
paper
so
as
to
have
it
ready
for
friday
mail
and
on
thursday
night
the
tin
reflectors
of
the
lamps
threw
their
lights
out
for
miles
across
the
prairie
far
into
the
night
telling
a
lost
people
the
day
of
the
week
it
thursday
night
the
night
the
paper
goes
to
press
more
than
one
homesteader
said
as
he
saw
it
it
was
a
long
tedious
job
to
print
so
many
newspapers
on
a
hand
press
one
at
a
time
fold
and
address
them
it
took
the
whole
ammons
force
and
a
few
of
the
neighbors
to
get
it
ready
for
the
mail
which
must
meet
the
mcclure
mail
stage
at
noon
while
one
of
us
rushed
off
with
the
mail
others
at
home
would
address
the
local
list
of
papers
and
put
them
in
the
mail
boxes
by
the
time
the
return
mail
came
in
for
distribution
our
mail
transport
was
our
old
topless
shay
repaired
and
repainted
for
the
purpose
with
the
brown
team
hitched
to
it
it
was
a
long
hot
drive
eight
miles
to
meet
the
stage
which
reached
mcclure
at
noon
jolting
along
under
a
big
cotton
umbrella
wired
to
the
back
of
the
seat
for
shade
i
slapped
the
brown
team
with
the
lines
and
consoled
myself
that
if
roughing
it
put
new
life
into
one
body
i
should
be
good
for
a
hundred
years
when
we
were
behind
time
and
the
mail
was
light
or
there
was
money
going
out
we
ran
lakota
through
as
a
pony
express
lakota
was
a
gift
from
the
indians
whose
name
meant
banded
together
as
friends
one
day
running
deer
had
come
over
to
ammons
leading
a
little
bronc
he
had
caught
her
in
a
bunch
of
wild
horses
which
roamed
the
plains
a
great
white
stallion
at
their
head
one
day
two
day
three
day
i
have
made
run
so
swift
like
eagle
then
i
rope
her
and
make
broke
for
ride
she
was
a
beauty
graceful
proud
and
lawless
good
blood
like
indian
chief
said
running
deer
with
pride
in
this
gift
from
the
sioux
but
white
squaw
she
throw
um
mebbe
rub
like
fawn
and
he
stroked
her
curved
neck
there
was
no
mebbe
about
throw
um
white
squaw
one
had
to
be
on
the
lookout
or
swift
like
eagle
she
would
jump
from
under
one
at
the
slightest
provocation
but
we
trained
her
to
carry
the
mail
and
though
there
was
no
banditry
in
that
section
we
had
to
be
on
our
guard
with
money
coming
in
no
man
would
ever
grab
the
mail
sack
from
back
that
little
outlaw
would
paw
him
to
death
whether
we
caught
the
mail
stage
or
not
often
depended
upon
the
mood
of
the
stage
driver
if
he
felt
tired
and
lazy
he
patiently
sat
in
front
of
the
halfway
house
at
mcclure
and
chawed
and
spat
until
he
saw
the
ammons
mail
coming
over
the
trail
if
he
were
out
of
sorts
he
drove
on
all
we
got
out
of
the
job
was
the
cancellation
of
stamps
as
it
was
a
office
in
which
the
government
furnished
the
stamps
and
we
kept
the
money
for
all
stamps
canceled
in
our
office
but
the
settlers
were
too
busy
to
write
letters
so
the
income
was
small
and
the
incoming
mail
for
which
we
received
no
pay
weighed
us
down
with
work
for
months
after
the
settlers
came
west
they
ordered
many
commodities
by
mail
and
their
friends
sent
them
everything
from
postcards
to
homemade
cookies
and
jelly
so
as
mail
carriers
we
became
pack
mules
but
we
went
on
carrying
mail
it
is
easier
to
get
into
things
than
to
get
out
much
of
the
ordering
of
commodities
by
the
settlers
was
done
through
the
huge
catalogs
issued
by
half
a
dozen
large
companies
in
the
east
those
catalogs
were
of
enormous
importance
to
the
homesteaders
for
the
women
they
had
the
interest
of
a
vast
department
store
through
which
one
could
wander
at
will
in
a
country
where
possessions
were
few
and
limited
to
essentials
those
pages
with
their
intriguing
cuts
represented
most
of
the
highly
desirable
things
in
life
from
the
catalogs
they
ordered
their
stoves
most
of
their
farming
implements
and
later
when
the
contrast
between
the
alluring
advertisements
and
the
bleak
shacks
grew
too
strong
for
the
women
to
endure
fancy
lamps
for
the
table
and
inexpensive
odds
and
ends
which
began
to
transform
those
rough
barren
houses
into
livable
homes
running
a
newspaper
out
here
was
as
ma
wagor
had
predicted
a
pestiferous
job
one
day
we
hung
the
rubber
roller
out
to
dry
and
the
sun
melted
it
flat
as
a
result
ada
had
to
ride
to
mcclure
to
borrow
one
from
before
we
could
print
the
paper
there
was
no
way
to
get
the
without
making
the
long
trip
to
presho
finally
every
homesteader
around
ammons
who
went
to
town
stopped
in
at
the
express
office
to
get
them
for
us
it
was
a
multiplication
of
effort
but
we
generally
got
the
prints
but
hard
as
it
was
the
work
did
not
tire
me
as
much
as
the
mere
mechanical
grind
of
the
work
on
had
done
each
day
was
so
filled
with
new
problems
and
new
interests
so
crammed
with
activity
that
we
were
carried
along
by
the
exhilaration
of
it
one
can
not
watch
an
empire
shoot
up
around
him
like
jack
beanstalk
without
feeling
the
compulsion
to
be
a
part
of
that
movement
that
growth
and
the
worst
barrier
we
had
to
face
had
vanished
the
initial
prejudice
against
two
young
girls
attempting
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
forward
movement
of
the
community
the
obstacles
of
a
raw
country
had
no
effect
on
ada
long
our
helper
she
came
of
a
struggling
family
who
had
settled
on
an
alkali
claim
set
back
from
everything
until
the
brulé
settlers
had
broken
a
trail
past
it
so
ada
finding
herself
in
a
new
moving
world
was
happy
with
her
long
yellow
braids
hanging
beneath
a
man
straw
hat
strong
capable
hands
and
an
easy
stride
she
went
about
singing
hymns
as
she
worked
taking
upon
herself
many
tasks
that
she
was
not
called
upon
to
perform
and
fred
farraday
was
taking
much
of
the
heavy
work
of
the
print
shop
off
our
hands
ma
wagor
too
was
an
invaluable
help
to
us
all
my
life
i
wanted
to
run
a
store
she
admitted
i
like
the
confusement
every
morning
she
came
across
the
prairie
sitting
straight
as
a
board
in
the
old
buggy
behind
a
spotted
horse
that
held
his
head
high
and
his
neck
stretched
like
a
giraffe
the
few
dollars
she
got
for
helping
in
the
store
eked
out
pa
small
pension
which
had
been
their
only
revenue
the
commodities
handled
at
the
store
had
increased
from
coffee
and
matches
to
innumerable
supplies
the
faithful
team
fan
and
bill
were
kept
on
the
road
most
of
the
time
we
made
business
trips
to
presho
and
pierre
help
was
not
always
available
and
there
could
be
no
waste
movements
in
a
wasteland
on
some
of
these
trips
we
hitched
the
team
to
the
big
lumber
wagon
and
hauled
out
barrels
of
oil
flour
printers
ink
and
other
supplies
for
all
and
sundry
of
our
enterprises
it
had
come
to
that
there
go
the
ammons
sisters
people
would
say
as
the
wagon
started
barrels
rattling
down
the
little
main
street
of
presho
off
to
the
hard
trail
home
slim
and
straight
and
absurdly
small
in
trim
shirt
waists
big
sombreros
tilted
over
our
heads
we
bounced
along
on
the
wagon
trying
to
look
as
mature
and
dignified
as
our
position
of
business
women

once
when
i
was

ill
to

we
stayed
for
the
night
in

in

get
enough

he
asked
we
eat
up

the

lamented
ida

he
laughed
keep
on
eating
them
up
and
slow
down
pioneer
women
old
and
new
went
through
many
hardships
and
privations
the
sodbreakers
women
over
the
strip
worked
hard
but
their
greatest
strain
was
that
of
endurance
rather
than
heavy
labor
but
refreshing
nights
with
the
plains
at
rest
and
exhilarating
morning
air
were
the
restoratives
hard
and
unrelieved
as
their
lives
were
in
many
respects
gallantly
as
they
shouldered
their
part
of
the
burden
of
homesteading
the
women
inevitably
brought
one
important
factor
into
the
homesteaders
lives
they
inaugurated
some
form
of
social
life
and
with
the
exchange
of
visits
the
impromptu
parties
the
informal
gatherings
and
the
politeness
the
amenities
they
demanded
however
modified
to
meet
frontier
conditions
civilization
came
to
stay
the
instinct
of
women
to
build
up
the
forms
of
social
life
is
and
historically
sound
out
of
the
forms
grow
traditions
and
from
the
traditions
grow
permanency
which
is
woman
only
protection
with
the
first
conscious
development
of
social
life
on
the
brulé
the
strip
took
on
a
more
settled
air
meanwhile
out
of
the
labor
the
first
results
began
to
appear
the
sodbreakers
were
going
to
have
a
crop
and
hay
hay
to
feed
their
livestock
and
to
sell
everyone
passing
through
the
strip
stopped
to
look
at
the
many
small
fields
and
a
few
large
ones
dotting
the
prairie
people
came
from
other
parts
of
the
frontier
to
see
the
rapid
development
which
the
brulé
had
made
mein
gott
in
himmel
shouted
old
husmann
pointing
to
a
field
of
oats
look
at
them
oats
we
get
one
hell
of
a
crop
for
raw
land
on
the
other
side
of
us
chris
christopherson
big
field
of
flax
was
in
full
bloom
like
a
blue
flower
garden
i
come
by
ioway
husmann
went
on
when
she
was
a
raw
country
and
i
say
gott
what
grass
but
i
see
no
grass
so
high
and
rich
like
this
the
gardens
matured
late
as
all
growth
on
the
western
prairie
does
the
seed
which
was
sown
on
the
sod
so
unusually
late
that
year
never
would
have
come
up
but
for
the
soaking
rains
now
there
were
lettuce
radishes
onions
and
other
things
one
could
not
buy
fresh
green
vegetables
anywhere
in
the
homestead
country
and
they
were
like
manna
from
heaven
it
had
been
almost
a
year
since
ida
mary
and
i
had
tasted
green
foods
it
is
a
curious
paradox
that
people
living
on
the
land
depended
for
food
or
canned
goods
from
the
cities
and
that
the
fresh
milk
and
cream
and
green
vegetables
associated
with
farm
life
were
unattainable
most
of
the
settlers
lived
principally
on
beans
and
potatoes
with
some
dried
fruits
but
we
had
bought
canned
fruits
oranges
and
apples
pretending
to
ourselves
that
we
would
stock
them
for
the
store
some
of
the
settlers
could
buy
such
foods
in
small
quantities
for
they
had
a
little
money
that
first
summer
but
the
indians
were
our
main
customers
for
the
more
expensive
things
buying
anything
we
wanted
to
sell
them
when
they
got
their
government
allowances
while
their
money
lasted
they
had
no
sales
resistance
whatever
this
characteristic
apparently
was
peculiar
to
the
brulé
indians
but
was
equally
true
of
those
in
the
oklahoma
reservation
who
boomed
the
luxury
trades
when
oil
was
discovered
on
their
land
there
it
was
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
a
gaudy
limousine
parked
outside
a
tepee
and
a
grand
piano
on
the
ground
inside
but
what
the
indians
did
buy
of
these
foods
at
forbidden
costs
we
ate
ourselves
cutting
seriously
into
our
profits
and
when
christopherson
sent
her
little
heine
over
one
day
with
a
bucket
of
green
beans
we
almost
foundered
as
animals
do
with
the
first
taste
of
green
feed
after
a
winter
of
dry
hay
we
had
a
few
rows
of
garden
east
of
our
shack
i
remember
gathering
something
out
of
it
lettuce
and
onions
probably
which
grew
abundantly
without
any
care
it
was
hot
and
everybody
on
the
strip
worn
out
from
strenuous
weeks
slowed
down
the
plains
were
covered
with
roses
wild
roses
trying
to
push
their
heads
above
the
tall
grass
the
people
who
had
worked
so
frantically
building
houses
putting
in
crops
walked
more
slowly
now
stopped
to
talk
and
rest
a
little
and
sit
in
the
shade
they
discovered
how
tired
they
were
and
the
devitalizing
heat
added
to
the
general
torpor
it
this
confusement
ma
wagor
said
that
wore
everybody
out
she
was
the
only
one
on
the
strip
to
continue
at
the
same
energetic
pace
there
ai
a
bit
of
use
wearing
yourself
out
trying
to
do
the
things
here
the
almighty
himself
has
got
around
to
yet
flying
right
in
the
face
of
the
lord
i
says
to
myself
sometimes
but
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
the
general
weariness
the
work
was
unrelenting
the
mail
must
be
delivered
regularly
the
paper
must
be
printed
one
day
ida
mary
voice
burst
in
upon
the
clicking
of
type
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
the
rattlesnakes
she
said
tragically
they
taking
the
country
she
was
right
they
were
taking
the
reservation
they
wriggled
through
the
tall
grass
making
ribbon
waves
as
they
went
they
coiled
like
a
rubber
hose
along
the
trails
crawled
up
to
the
very
doors
stopped
there
only
by
screens
one
never
picked
up
an
object
without
first
investigating
with
a
board
or
stick
lest
there
be
a
snake
under
it
it
became
such
an
obsession
that
if
anyone
did
pick
up
something
without
finding
a
snake
under
it
he
felt
as
disappointed
as
if
he
had
run
to
a
fire
and
found
it
out
when
he
got
there
on
horseback
or
afoot
one
was
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
them
for
those
gray
coiled
horrors
were
deadly
we
knew
that
there
were
plenty
of
stories
of
people
who
heard
that
dry
rattle
saw
the
lightning
speed
of
the
strike
and
the
telltale
pricks
on
arm
or
ankle
and
waited
for
the
inevitable
agony
and
swift
death
the
snakes
always
sounded
their
warning
the
chilling
rattle
before
they
struck
but
they
rarely
gave
time
for
escape
sourdough
stopped
at
the
store
one
morning
for
tobacco
he
had
a
pair
of
boots
tied
to
his
saddle
and
when
ida
mary
stepped
to
the
door
to
hand
him
the
tobacco
a
rattlesnake
slithered
out
from
one
of
the
boots
he
jumped
off
his
horse
and
killed
it
damn
my
skin
sourdough
exclaimed
and
here
i
slept
on
them
boots
last
night
for
a
pillow
i
oughta
stretched
a
rope
plainsmen
camping
out
made
it
a
practice
to
stretch
a
rope
around
camp
or
pallet
as
a
barricade
against
snakes
they
would
not
cross
the
hairy
fuzzy
rope
we
were
told
it
may
be
true
but
there
was
not
a
rope
made
that
i
would
trust
to
keep
snakes
out
on
that
reservation
i
remember
camping
out
one
night
with
a
group
of
homesteaders
the
ground
was
carefully
searched
and
a
rope
stretched
before
we
turned
in
but
it
was
a
haggard
group
which
started
back
the
next
morning
true
there
had
been
any
rattlesnakes
but
from
the
amount
of
thinking
about
them
that
had
been
done
that
night
there
might
as
well
have
been
a
young
homesteader
rushed
into
the
print
shop
one
day
white
as
a
sheet
a
snake
he
gasped
a
big
rattler
across
the
trail
in
front
of
the
store
what
of
it
have
you
ever
seen
a
snake
before
have
i
he
replied
dismally
i
saw
them
for
six
months
back
there
in
cleveland
but
my
snakes
did
rattle
ours
rattled
the
rattle
of
the
snake
became
as
familiar
as
the
song
of
the
bird
the
settlers
were
losing
livestock
every
day
everyone
was
in
danger
with
the
hot
dry
weather
they
became
bigger
and
thicker
the
cutting
of
great
tracts
of
grass
for
hay
stirred
them
into
viperous
action
they
were
harder
to
combat
than
droughts
and
blizzards
not
many
regions
were
so
thickly
infested
as
that
reservation
those
snakes
are
a
part
of
its
history
could
be
many
in
other
regions
olaf
rasmusson
an
earnest
young
farmer
said
dryly
they
all
settled
here
look
out
for
snakes
became
the
watchword
on
the
strip
christopherson
little
heine
a
small
taciturn
boy
of
five
who
had
become
a
daily
silent
visitor
at
the
store
came
in
one
afternoon
roused
into
what
for
him
was
a
garrulous
outburst
there
a
snake
right
out
here
and
i
bet
it
six
feet
long
the
way
it
rattles
ada
grabbed
a
pole
and
tried
to
kill
it
the
monster
struck
back
like
the
cracking
of
a
whip
she
backed
off
and
with
her
strong
arm
hit
again
and
again
while
ida
mary
ran
with
a
pitchfork
keep
out
of
the
way
shouted
ada
you
may
get
bitten
winded
ada
fanned
herself
with
her
straw
hat
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
her
face
i
got
that
fellow
she
said
triumphantly
this
was
one
problem
about
which
seemed
helpless
ink
would
have
no
effect
on
the
snakes
and
if
this
horror
were
published
the
strip
would
be
isolated
like
a
leper
colony
after
using
so
much
ingenuity
in
building
up
the
achievements
of
that
country
the
announcement
of
this
plague
of
snakes
might
undo
all
that
had
been
accomplished
and
the
snakes
increased
when
ida
mary
was
out
of
sight
i
worried
constantly
it
was
like
one
fear
for
a
person
in
battle
who
may
be
struck
by
a
bullet
at
any
moment
but
the
rattler
was
more
surely
fatal
when
it
struck
than
the
bullet
something
had
to
be
done
to
hades
with
what
the
world
thought
about
our
having
snakes
we
had
to
do
something
that
would
bring
relief
from
this
horror
we
went
to
the
old
medicine
men
john
yellow
grass
i
think
was
one
of
them
to
find
out
how
the
indians
got
rid
of
snakes
they
did
but
at
least
they
knew
what
to
do
when
you
had
been
bitten
the
indian
medicine
men
said
to
bleed
the
wound
instantly
bandaging
the
flesh
tightly
above
and
below
to
keep
the
poison
from
circulating
that
was
the
indians
treatment
and
as
a
last
resort
suck
the
wound
printed
warnings
bank
your
houses
keep
doors
and
windows
tightly
screened
keep
a
bottle
of
whisky
close
at
hand
carry
vinegar
soda
and
bandages
with
you
and
a
sharp
knife
to
slash
and
bleed
the
wound
what
a
run
there
was
on
vinegar
and
pocket
knives
by
this
time
the
sight
of
a
coiled
rope
made
me
jumpy
and
i
dreamed
of
snakes
writhing
coiling
moving
in
undulating
lines
at
noon
one
day
i
was
alone
making
up
the
paper
i
stood
at
the
form
table
working
when
i
turned
abruptly
a
snake
slimy
head
was
thrust
through
a
big
knothole
in
the
floor
its
beady
eyes
held
me
for
a
moment
as
they
are
said
to
hypnotize
a
bird
i
could
neither
move
nor
scream
then
with
a
reflex
action
i
threw
an
empty
galley
an
oblong
metal
tray
used
to
put
the
set
type
in
square
over
the
hole
the
snake
moved
so
quickly
it
missed
the
blow
and
lay
under
the
floor
hissing
like
an
engine
letting
off
steam
it
would
have
been
in
the
print
shop
in
another
second
the
floor
was
laid
on
inch
scantlings
so
there
was
nothing
to
keep
snakes
from
working
their
way
under
it
should
have
been
banked
around
the
foundation
with
sod
the
next
day
a
homesteader
little
girl
was
bitten
oh
for
serum
but
if
there
were
any
such
on
the
market
we
had
no
way
of
getting
it
called
a
meeting
of
the
settlers
and
laid
plans
of
warfare
against
the
snakes
the
homesteaders
organized
small
posses
and
cowboys
and
indian
bucks
joined
in
that
war
against
the
reptiles
they
killed
them
by
the
dozens
in
every
conceivable
manner
the
cowboys
were
always
telling
about
shooting
their
heads
off
and
they
said
the
indians
used
an
arrow
spearing
them
in
the
neck
just
back
of
the
head
they
never
let
one
get
away
if
they
could
help
it
some
of
them
claimed
they
picked
up
rattlesnakes
by
the
tails
and
cracked
their
heads
off
the
snakes
wintered
in
the
holes
but
i
never
heard
of
a
prairie
dog
being
bitten
by
one
of
them
on
warm
days
in
late
fall
the
snakes
came
out
of
the
holes
and
lay
coiled
thick
on
the
ground
sunning
themselves
while
the
little
dogs
sat
up
on
their
hind
legs
and
yipped
in
their
squeaky
voices
the
settlers
and
cowboys
invaded
the
dog
towns
and
killed
off
the
snakes
by
the
hundred
dog
towns
were
the
tracts
where
the
prairie
dogs
made
their
homes
during
the
intensive
snake
war
a
homesteader
came
from
one
of
the
big
towns
to
take
us
over
to
look
at
the
kill
there
strung
on
wires
hung
more
than
a
hundred
huge
horrid
rattlers
many
of
them
still
wriggling
and
twisting
and
coiling
like
a
thrown
lariat
it
seems
too
bad
the
snakeskin
industry
of
today
missed
that
bonanza
of
supply
and
that
science
did
not
make
a
more
general
use
of
rattlesnake
serum
at
that
time
the
settlers
would
have
made
some
easy
money
and
science
would
have
got
serum
in
unlimited
quantity
this
is
a
gruesome
subject
the
constant
lurking
menace
of
the
snakes
was
one
of
the
hardest
things
the
frontier
had
to
endure
harder
than
drought
or
blizzard
but
in
one
way
and
another
we
came
through
instead
of
campaign
against
snakes
injuring
the
strip
it
created
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
people
said
we
were
subduing
the
frontier
easy
oh
yes
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
illustration
ix
the
opening
of
the
rosebud
the
settling
of
those
western
lands
was
as
elemental
as
the
earth
and
no
phase
of
its
settlement
was
as
dramatic
as
the
opening
of
the
rosebud
homesteading
was
now
the
biggest
movement
in
america
we
were
entering
a
great
period
of
land
development
running
its
course
between
and
our
entrance
into
the
world
war
in
the
people
were
land
crazy
the
western
fever
became
an
epidemic
that
spread
like
a
prairie
fire
day
by
day
we
watched
the
vast
voluntary
migration
of
a
people
men
with
families
to
support
frail
women
with
no
one
to
help
them
few
of
them
with
money
enough
to
carry
them
through
took
the
chance
with
the
odds
against
them
i
have
seen
men
appear
with
their
families
ten
dollars
in
their
pockets
or
only
five
after
the
filing
fee
on
the
land
was
paid
i
have
seen
them
sleep
on
the
prairie
get
odd
jobs
here
and
there
until
they
could
throw
up
a
shelter
out
of
scrap
lumber
and
slowly
get
a
foothold
often
becoming
substantial
citizens
of
a
community
they
helped
to
build
free
land
free
land
it
was
like
the
tune
piped
by
the
pied
piper
this
is
the
chance
for
the
poor
man
i
wrote
in
when
the
supply
of
free
land
is
exhausted
the
poor
man
can
not
hope
to
own
land
if
the
moneyed
powers
get
hold
of
this
cheap
land
as
an
investment
they
will
force
the
price
beyond
the
grasp
of
the
masses
the
west
is
the
reserve
upon
which
the
future
growth
and
food
supply
of
the
nation
must
depend
ida
mary
said
that
i
was
running
to
land
as
a
missourian
did
to
mules
but
was
fast
becoming
identified
with
the
land
movement
as
the
homesteaders
flowed
in
a
great
sea
out
of
the
towns
and
cities
into
the
west
one
wondered
at
their
courage
there
was
not
the
hope
which
inspires
a
gold
rush
the
possibility
of
a
gold
strike
which
may
bring
sudden
wealth
and
ease
the
road
was
long
the
only
likely
signs
of
achievement
an
extra
room
on
the
shack
a
few
more
acres
of
ground
turned
under
and
eventual
security
that
was
it
security
a
piece
of
ground
that
belonged
to
them
on
which
they
could
plant
their
feet
permanency
in
answer
to
that
cry
for
land
there
came
another
proclamation
from
the
president
theodore
roosevelt
another
great
tract
of
land
the
great
rosebud
indian
reservation
with
a
million
acres
of
homesteads
was
to
be
thrown
open
a
lottery
with
square
miles
of
territory
as
the
sweepstakes
and
people
playing
its
wheel
of
fortune
trying
to
describe
its
size
and
sweep
and
significance
i
find
myself
in
the
vernacular
of
the
range
plumb
flabbergasted
of
course
there
were
some
among
the
homesteaders
on
the
lower
brulé
who
found
the
grass
greener
on
the
rosebud
and
wanted
to
throw
up
their
claims
and
move
on
to
new
ground
but
the
government
informed
them
somewhat
grimly
that
they
could
prove
up
where
they
were
or
not
at
all
and
i
can
understand
their
restlessness
to
this
day
i
never
hear
of
some
new
frontier
being
developed
without
pricking
up
my
ears
and
quivering
like
a
circus
horse
when
he
hears
a
band
play
there
are
some
desert
products
that
ca
be
rooted
out
sagebrush
and
cactus
and
the
hold
of
the
open
spaces
the
rosebud
opening
was
one
of
the
most
famous
lotteries
of
them
all
the
rosebud
reservation
lay
in
tripp
county
across
white
river
from
the
brulé
its
conversion
into
homesteads
meant
an
immediate
income
for
the
united
states
treasury
but
according
to
a
recent
law
all
monies
received
from
the
sale
of
the
lands
were
to
be
deposited
to
the
credit
of
the
indians
belonging
to
and
having
tribal
rights
on
the
reservation
the
funds
thus
acquired
to
be
used
by
congress
for
the
education
support
and
civilization
of
the
indians
the
name
rosebud
was
emblazoned
across
the
nation
after
the
government
proclamation
in
the
newspapers
in
railroad
pamphlets
on
public
buildings
as
usual
the
railroads
played
a
major
part
in
aiding
prospective
settlers
to
reach
the
registration
points
a
little
western
villages
the
frontier
town
of
pierre
had
been
unprepared
for
the
avalanche
of
people
who
had
descended
upon
it
during
the
lower
brulé
opening
service
and
equipment
had
been
inadequate
in
the
great
bonesteel
opening
a
few
years
earlier
gambling
and
lawlessness
had
run
riot
therefore
superintendent
witten
formulated
and
revised
the
drawing
system
endeavoring
to
work
out
the
most
suitable
plan
for
disposing
of
these
tracts
so
that
there
might
be
no
suggestion
of
unfairness
railroads
traversing
the
west
had
already
begun
to
extend
their
lines
still
farther
into
the
section
starting
new
towns
along
their
lines
running
landseekers
excursions
in
an
effort
to
show
the
people
what
this
country
had
to
offer
them
in
preparation
for
the
rosebud
opening
they
prepared
for
the
influx
of
people
on
a
gigantic
scale
made
ready
to
take
whole
colonies
from
various
sections
of
the
east
and
middle
west
to
the
reservation
among
the
registration
points
was
the
little
town
of
presho
a
crude
unfinished
little
town
with
a
wild
west
flavor
about
it
presho
could
help
doing
things
in
a
spectacular
fashion
like
most
hurriedly
built
frontier
towns
there
was
little
symmetry
to
it
two
irregular
rows
of
small
business
places
most
of
them
structures
with
other
shops
and
offices
set
back
on
side
streets
its
houses
were
set
thickly
dotting
the
prairie
around
its
main
street
two
years
before
it
had
been
merely
an
unsettled
stretch
of
prairie
then
the
milwaukee
railroad
platted
the
town
bringing
out
carloads
of
people
to
the
auction
two
men
named
dirks
and
sedgwick
paid
for
the
first
lot
on
which
to
start
a
bank
that
was
more
than
the
list
price
they
had
a
little
building
like
a
sheep
wagon
or
a
cook
shack
on
wheels
which
they
rolled
onto
the
lot
within
eight
minutes
the
bank
was
open
for
business
the
first
deposit
in
fact
was
made
while
the
bank
rolled
along
two
barrels
and
a
plank
served
as
a
counter
the
two
founders
had
the
necessary
capital
and
when
the
cashier
went
to
dinner
he
took
all
the
money
with
him
with
two
for
protection
he
was
never
robbed
for
two
years
during
the
land
boom
the
bank
had
not
closed
day
or
night
locators
coming
in
in
the
middle
of
the
night
from
their
long
trips
over
the
territory
would
knock
on
the
door
in
the
back
end
of
the
bank
the
banker
would
open
the
door
a
crack
stick
his
gun
out
and
demand
who
there
it
kimball
got
a
bunch
of
seekers
here
they
have
to
catch
the
train
east
the
locator
or
other
person
wanting
to
transact
business
after
the
banker
had
gone
to
bed
had
to
identify
himself
before
the
door
was
opened
when
the
homestead
movement
of
that
region
was
at
its
height
thousands
of
dollars
passed
over
the
counter
in
the
bank
business
the
rosebud
has
been
throwed
open
went
the
cry
the
entire
western
country
made
ready
for
the
invasion
of
the
landseekers
the
government
red
tape
for
the
lottery
with
its
various
registration
points
would
require
a
small
army
to
handle
it
was
one
of
the
most
gigantic
governmental
programs
ever
known
notaries
had
to
be
appointed
to
take
care
of
the
affidavits
land
locators
selected
to
show
the
seekers
the
land
accommodations
provided
for
the
who
registered
in
that
drawing
even
the
brulé
was
crowded
with
people
ready
to
play
their
luck
in
the
land
lottery
every
available
corner
was
utilized
for
sleeping
space
and
the
store
at
ammons
did
a
record
business
that
would
help
pay
the
wholesale
bills
at
martin
store
ida
mary
was
busy
taking
care
of
postal
duties
handling
increased
mail
government
notices
etc
during
the
summer
our
financial
condition
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
do
you
know
those
ammons
girls
one
native
westerner
asked
another
came
out
from
louis
about
as
big
as
my
annie
annie
was
about
twelve
head
wranglers
out
on
the
lower
brulé
newspaper
trading
post
whole
works
well
they
last
till
their
money
is
gone
and
it
was
about
gone
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
meet
these
payments
edith
ida
mary
asked
one
day
in
a
breathing
spell
there
was
enough
money
to
pay
for
groceries
printing
equipment
interest
etc
if
we
could
only
hold
on
the
proof
notices
would
bring
in
or
more
which
was
big
money
out
there
but
the
proof
season
was
almost
a
year
ahead
and
the
money
had
already
been
pledged
profit
and
loss
my
head
ached
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
hit
on
the
head
by
square
miles
of
brulé
sod
ma
wagor
offered
us
a
way
out
of
one
of
our
difficulties
she
always
wanted
a
store
she
liked
the
confusement
so
we
turned
the
store
over
to
the
wagors
lock
stock
and
barrel
prunes
and
molasses
barrels
of
and
vinegar
padlocks
on
the
doors
they
had
no
money
but
ma
wanted
it
as
much
as
we
wanted
to
be
rid
of
it
so
it
was
a
satisfactory
deal
they
were
to
pay
us
on
a
percentage
basis
we
still
had
a
claim
a
post
office
and
a
newspaper
to
manage
and
the
indian
trade
to
handle
it
looks
as
though
the
ammons
venture
is
going
under
people
were
beginning
to
say
i
went
to
presho
and
the
small
towns
near
by
and
somewhat
to
my
own
surprise
succeeded
in
getting
more
advertising
for
but
it
was
enough
one
night
i
came
home
determined
that
something
must
be
done
the
whole
arrangement
seemed
to
me
unfair
to
ida
mary
sister
i
said
going
to
give
up
the
claim
she
quietly
put
down
her
book
open
so
as
not
to
lose
the
page
and
waited
for
me
to
go
on
i
told
west
today
that
we
would
sell
i
am
going
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
on
your
homestead
clean
up
the
other
debts
and
and
then
what
i
do
know
do
give
up
your
land
edith
something
will
happen
something
always
happens
she
went
back
to
her
book
something
did
happen
the
rosebud
opening
i
was
to
cover
it
for
a
western
newspaper
syndicate
and
this
time
i
had
the
inside
track
being
familiar
with
the
field
and
with
the
government
lottery
operations
i
would
be
able
to
get
my
stories
out
while
other
reporters
were
finding
out
what
it
was
all
about
remembering
the
money
i
had
made
with
the
little
verses
printed
on
a
postcard
at
the
brulé
opening
i
prepared
another
on
the
rosebud
with
the
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
helping
me
by
making
drawings
to
illustrate
it
then
armed
with
the
postcards
i
set
off
for
presho
and
the
rosebud
on
a
sunday
night
in
early
october
i
stood
on
a
corner
of
the
dark
main
street
of
presho
waiting
for
the
rosebud
to
open
i
had
appointed
agents
to
handle
my
postcards
and
i
was
free
to
cover
the
story
special
trains
loaded
with
landseekers
were
coming
the
confusion
of
preparations
to
receive
them
was
at
its
height
i
found
presho
as
mad
as
a
hornet
the
milwaukee
railroad
had
taken
the
turntable
out
and
special
trains
coming
in
from
chicago
and
other
points
east
must
thus
go
on
to
the
next
town
to
turn
around
this
was
bound
to
cut
into
presho
share
of
the
crowds
as
long
as
the
town
had
been
the
turning
point
of
the
road
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
trade
centers
in
that
part
of
the
west
the
lottery
was
to
start
monday
which
meant
the
stroke
of
midnight
the
little
town
was
ready
its
dark
streets
lighted
here
and
there
by
flaring
arc
lights
up
and
down
main
street
and
out
over
the
fields
tents
had
been
erected
to
take
care
of
the
crowd
and
the
trains
were
coming
in
unloading
their
human
cargo
others
poured
in
by
every
conceivable
means
of
transportation
invading
the
little
frontier
town
the
only
spot
of
civilization
in
the
vast
bare
stretch
of
plains
presho
woke
to
find
a
great
drove
of
tenderfeet
stampeding
down
its
little
main
street
they
thundered
down
the
board
sidewalk
and
milled
in
the
middle
of
the
road
kicking
up
dust
like
a
herd
of
range
cattle
as
they
went
aside
from
the
great
tents
put
up
by
some
of
the
towns
for
lodging
and
eating
quarters
small
tents
dotted
the
outskirts
people
were
bringing
their
own
camping
equipment
and
i
might
add
that
only
those
who
had
such
foresight
slept
during
those
turbulent
days
the
daily
train
was
an
event
in
these
frontier
towns
its
coming
watched
by
most
of
the
inhabitants
now
five
and
six
a
day
roared
in
spilled
to
passengers
into
the
packed
streets
and
roared
away
again
as
the
heavily
loaded
trains
met
or
passed
each
other
along
the
route
the
excited
crowds
called
jovially
to
one
another
suckers
suckers
with
but
claims
the
chance
to
win
was
slim
on
the
station
platform
in
the
thick
of
the
crowds
were
the
indians
after
all
it
appeared
they
were
learning
from
the
white
man
this
time
they
had
come
in
an
enlightened
and
wholly
commercial
spirit
brave
in
paint
and
feathers
and
beads
they
strolled
about
posing
for
the
landseekers
for
cents
a
picture
a
maze
of
activity
was
under
way
before
the
stroke
of
midnight
telephone
companies
installed
additional
equipment
and
service
telegraph
wires
were
being
strung
up
expert
men
were
being
rushed
out
from
kansas
city
and
omaha
to
take
care
of
the
flood
of
words
that
would
soon
go
pouring
out
to
the
nation
telling
the
story
of
the
gamble
for
land
a
magazine
editor
notebook
in
hand
moved
from
one
group
of
seekers
to
another
asking
do
you
think
taft
will
be
elected
he
did
seem
to
be
getting
far
on
the
eve
of
a
presidential
election
a
people
was
turning
to
the
soil
for
security
do
you
think
taft
will
be
elected
the
editor
repeated
patiently
who
gives
a
damn
shouted
a
steel
worker
from
philadelphia
a
train
lumbered
in
heavily
from
chicago
fourteen
coaches
crowded
to
standing
room
only
men
and
women
herded
and
tagged
like
sheep
they
stumbled
out
onto
the
dark
platform
jostled
among
the
mob
already
assembled
exhausted
dirty
yet
shaking
with
excitement
that
excitement
of
course
was
partly
due
to
strain
and
suspense
partly
to
the
gambling
spirit
in
which
the
lottery
was
carried
out
but
for
the
most
part
the
crowd
generated
its
own
excitement
through
its
great
numbers
and
consequent
rivalry
as
it
entered
the
dark
streets
with
their
glaring
lights
the
mad
confusion
of
shouting
and
band
playing
they
came
from
chicago
and
jerkwater
towns
in
nebraska
from
farms
and
steel
mills
from
the
stage
and
the
pulpit
school
teachers
and
farm
boys
clerks
and
stenographers
bookkeepers
and
mechanics
business
men
and
lawyers
perhaps
the
most
significant
thing
was
the
presence
of
those
business
men
often
coming
in
whole
groups
to
study
the
country
and
its
possibilities
to
be
on
hand
when
the
town
sites
were
opened
to
be
the
first
to
start
businesses
on
the
rosebud
on
the
brulé
there
had
been
nothing
but
the
land
here
the
plows
the
farm
implements
salesmen
of
every
conceivable
commodity
needed
by
settlers
were
on
hand
these
people
were
to
start
with
supplies
in
sight
with
business
organizing
in
advance
to
handle
their
problems
with
capital
waiting
for
their
needs
and
they
came
by
the
thousands
from
chicago
alone
there
came
one
group
of
seekers
move
on
came
the
endless
chant
move
on
it
matter
where
so
long
as
they
kept
moving
making
way
for
new
mobs
of
restless
people
move
on
wires
were
clicking
with
news
from
the
other
registration
points
presho
to
its
fury
could
compare
with
some
of
the
other
towns
the
little
town
of
dallas
had
gone
stark
mad
carloads
of
seekers
were
due
in
these
villages
between
midnight
and
morning
they
were
coming
from
every
direction
bringing
along
with
the
individual
seekers
whole
groups
of
new
england
farmers
iowa
business
men
an
organization
of
clerks
from
cleveland
and
from
everywhere
the
farmers
over
the
uproar
of
the
crowd
could
be
heard
the
sharp
staccato
click
of
the
telegraph
wires
special
trains
were
coming
from
omaha
came
the
news
the
police
force
had
tried
to
keep
the
crowds
from
smothering
each
other
but
they
had
torn
down
the
gate
of
the
station
and
rushed
through
afraid
to
be
left
behind
runners
came
overland
across
the
empty
rosebud
to
carry
the
news
from
the
little
towns
riding
their
horses
foaming
although
the
night
was
cold
you
ought
to
see
dallas
folks
people
lighting
like
grasshoppers
you
ought
to
see
gregory
the
rivalry
was
bitter
among
the
towns
each
trying
to
corner
as
much
of
the
crowd
as
possible
presho
was
sending
out
word
vehemently
denying
the
reports
that
an
epidemic
of
black
smallpox
had
broken
out
there
men
representing
everything
from
flop
tents
to
locating
agents
boarded
trains
en
route
trying
to
persuade
the
seekers
to
register
at
their
respective
towns
and
all
of
them
were
bitter
against
the
railroads
which
were
furnishing
return
accommodations
every
few
hours
giving
the
tradesmen
little
chance
to
make
their
fortunes
as
many
of
them
had
confidently
expected
to
do
automobiles
many
bought
for
the
occasion
lined
the
streets
of
these
border
towns
ready
to
take
the
seekers
over
the
land
if
they
stayed
long
enough
it
surprised
the
easterners
this
evidence
of
modernity
in
a
pioneer
world
and
here
and
there
a
new
automobile
parked
beside
a
prairie
schooner
curiously
enough
the
price
of
the
land
distributed
by
the
openings
was
higher
than
that
of
vast
tracts
of
untouched
land
in
the
west
which
was
also
available
to
the
public
and
yet
attention
was
concentrated
solely
on
the
rosebud
the
desire
for
land
there
was
at
fever
heat
while
other
land
was
regarded
with
apathy
whether
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
other
land
was
little
known
or
to
the
madness
that
attends
any
gambling
operation
and
the
intensive
advertising
which
had
called
attention
to
the
rosebud
i
do
not
know
but
this
land
was
not
free
for
these
indian
lands
the
government
charged
from
to
an
acre
according
to
classification
thus
acres
of
land
would
cost
the
homesteader
around
a
thousand
dollars
down
the
rest
in
annual
payments
under
the
proof
plan
if
he
made
commutation
proof
in
fourteen
months
the
minimum
residence
required
he
must
then
make
payment
in
full
the
hours
wore
on
toward
midnight
and
the
crowd
grew
denser
move
on
droned
the
chant
move
on
the
editor
had
turned
the
page
of
his
notebook
and
spoke
to
one
of
the
women
landseekers
are
you
a
suffragette
he
asked
politely
pushing
back
an
elbow
that
had
grazed
her
cheek
pulling
her
hat
firmly
over
her
head
clutching
her
handbag
firmly
she
looked
at
him
wonderingly
are
you
he
began
again
but
someone
shouted
move
on
and
the
woman
disappeared
in
the
throng
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
a
cry
went
up
from
the
registrars
at
under
the
dim
flicker
of
lanterns
and
torches
hung
on
posts
or
set
on
barrels
and
boxes
that
most
famous
of
lotteries
began
the
uproar
and
confusion
of
the
hours
before
midnight
were
like
a
desert
calm
compared
with
the
clamor
which
broke
out
registrars
lined
both
sides
of
the
street
right
this
way
folks
here
you
are
here
you
are
register
right
here
and
there
on
rough
tables
on
boxes
anything
upon
which
a
piece
of
paper
could
be
filled
out
and
a
notary
seal
stamped
thereon
the
crowd
put
in
their
applications
as
entries
in
the
gamble
raised
their
right
hands
and
swore
i
do
solemnly
swear
that
i
honestly
desire
to
enter
public
lands
for
my
own
personal
use
as
a
home
and
for
settlement
and
cultivation
and
not
for
speculation
or
in
the
interest
of
some
other
person
in
the
excitement
and
chill
of
the
october
night
fingers
shook
so
that
they
could
scarcely
hold
a
pen
commissioned
notaries
were
getting
cents
a
head
from
the
applicants
real
estate
offices
were
jammed
in
between
the
registration
stands
were
the
and
coffee
booths
with
the
tenders
yelling
while
thick
black
coffee
flowed
into
tin
cups
by
the
barrel
and
sandwiches
were
handed
out
by
the
tubful
popcorn
and
peanut
venders
pushed
through
the
crowd
crying
their
wares
and
among
the
voices
were
those
of
the
agents
who
were
selling
my
postcards
selling
them
like
liniment
in
a
show
spielers
shouted
the
virtues
of
the
food
or
drink
or
tent
or
land
locator
they
were
advertising
even
the
notaries
got
megaphones
to
announce
their
services
until
government
authorities
stepped
in
and
threatened
to
close
them
all
up
into
the
slits
in
the
huge
cans
which
held
the
applications
dropped
a
surprising
number
of
items
people
became
confused
and
used
it
as
a
mail
box
dropping
in
souvenir
cards
one
applicant
even
dropped
in
his
return
fare
and
some
shaking
uncontrollably
with
excitement
were
barely
able
to
drop
their
applications
in
at
all
and
somewhere
off
in
the
dark
spaces
beyond
the
flickering
lights
lay
the
million
acres
of
land
for
which
the
horde
was
clamoring
its
quiet
sleep
unbroken
there
was
a
sharp
tug
at
my
arm
and
i
turned
to
see
the
reporter
from
chicago
who
had
filed
on
the
brulé
opening
i
trying
my
luck
again
he
said
so
he
had
not
won
in
the
brulé
lottery
somehow
i
was
glad
to
know
that
was
the
reason
for
his
not
being
on
a
claim
there
sensing
this
he
said
grimly
so
you
thought
i
was
a
quitter
as
we
clung
to
each
other
to
keep
from
being
separated
in
the
hysterical
mob
i
heard
his
hollow
cough
are
you
ill
i
asked
it
this
crowd
and
the
dust
my
lungs
got
to
come
west
i
grabbed
him
by
the
coat
sleeve
trying
to
make
my
voice
carry
above
the
ballyhoo
if
you
do
not
win
here
come
and
see
me
i
can
get
you
a
claim
the
swaying
throng
separated
us
i
rushed
to
the
telegraph
office
and
sent
off
my
story
as
i
started
back
i
stopped
to
look
upon
the
little
town
which
had
been
started
at
the
end
of
the
iron
trail
revealed
in
the
light
of
torches
against
a
black
sky
and
at
the
faces
white
and
drawn
and
tense
move
on
move
on
at
that
monday
morning
four
hours
after
arrival
the
landseekers
who
had
registered
were
on
the
road
back
to
chicago
and
all
points
east
many
of
them
carrying
in
one
hand
a
chunk
of
sod
and
in
the
other
a
tuft
of
grass
tangible
evidence
that
they
had
been
on
the
land
and
other
trains
were
rushing
out
carrying
more
people
i
boarded
a
returning
special
which
was
packed
like
a
freight
train
full
of
range
cattle
men
and
women
tired
and
but
geared
up
by
hope
i
got
off
at
chamberlain
the
rumors
had
been
correct
that
seething
mob
at
presho
was
only
the
spray
cast
by
the
tidal
wave
at
chamberlain
long
heavily
loaded
trains
pulled
in
and
out
people
walked
ten
and
twelve
abreast
through
the
streets
some
strangers
besieged
that
frontier
town
a
mob
of
tried
to
fill
out
application
blanks
tried
to
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
some
place
to
sleep
while
the
saloons
were
overrun
there
was
little
drunkenness
no
man
could
stand
at
the
bar
long
enough
to
get
drunk
if
he
managed
to
get
one
drink
or
two
at
most
he
was
pushed
aside
before
he
could
get
another
to
make
room
for
someone
else
move
on
move
on
the
stockmen
were
shocked
they
had
not
dreamed
of
anything
like
this
invasion
their
range
was
going
and
they
owned
none
or
little
of
the
land
the
old
indians
looked
on
silent
and
morose
hotels
locating
agents
all
the
first
chance
and
last
chance
saloons
became
voluntary
distributors
of
my
postcards
it
looked
as
though
i
too
were
going
to
reap
a
harvest
from
the
rosebud
opening
and
they
continued
to
come
within
four
days
people
had
made
entry
and
the
trains
continued
to
pull
in
and
out
loaded
to
the
doors
unlike
the
lower
brulé
opening
there
was
no
dreary
standing
in
line
for
hours
even
days
at
a
time
the
seekers
passed
down
the
line
like
rapidly
inspected
herds
and
among
them
inevitably
came
the
parasites
who
live
on
crowds
gamblers
crooks
sharks
pickpockets
and
the
notorious
women
who
followed
border
boom
towns
the
pioneer
towns
were
outraged
and
every
citizen
automatically
became
a
peace
officer
shipping
the
crooks
out
as
fast
as
they
were
discovered
they
would
they
declared
virtuously
tolerate
anything
but
honest
gambling
and
their
own
gambling
rooms
continued
to
run
hours
a
day
in
spite
of
precautions
not
a
few
of
the
trusting
folk
from
farms
and
small
towns
to
whom
this
event
was
a
carnival
affair
found
themselves
shorn
like
sheep
at
shearing
time
before
they
knew
what
was
happening
one
farm
boy
lost
not
only
all
his
money
but
his
fine
team
and
wagon
as
well
a
carnival
it
was
of
course
in
some
respects
amusement
stands
in
tents
or
shacks
lined
the
streets
and
never
closed
warnings
came
by
letter
to
superintendent
witten
describing
crooks
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
rosebud
motion
pictures
ran
day
and
night
their
ballyhoo
added
to
the
outcries
of
the
other
barkers
and
the
registration
never
stopped
clerks
and
others
employed
as
assistants
by
the
government
were
hired
in
shifts
post
offices
stayed
open
all
night
the
government
headquarters
were
at
dallas
with
a
retinue
of
officials
in
charge
thus
the
little
town
at
the
end
of
the
north
western
railroad
was
the
mecca
of
that
lottery
there
the
hysterical
mob
spirit
appeared
and
one
day
in
the
midst
of
the
opening
a
prairie
fire
broke
out
sweeping
at
forty
miles
an
hour
over
the
land
the
people
had
come
to
claim
sweeping
straight
toward
dallas
the
whole
town
turned
out
to
fight
it
it
had
to
the
indians
pitched
in
to
help
and
the
tenderfeet
including
reporters
and
photographers
from
the
big
city
newspapers
turned
fire
fighters
fighting
to
save
the
town
in
spite
of
their
efforts
the
fire
reached
the
very
borders
of
the
town
destroying
a
few
buildings
and
at
the
sight
of
the
flames
the
government
employees
caught
up
the
great
cans
which
contained
the
seekers
applications
for
the
land
and
rushed
them
out
of
town
toward
safety
that
day
the
cans
contained
applications
that
great
black
charred
area
extending
for
miles
over
the
prairie
put
a
damper
on
the
spirits
of
the
locating
agents
but
these
people
had
come
for
land
and
they
were
not
to
be
daunted
all
over
the
great
reservation
groups
could
be
seen
investigating
the
soil
digging
under
the
surface
driving
on
into
the
regions
of
tall
grass
and
scattered
fields
bordering
the
rosebud
they
were
hoping
to
win
a
piece
of
that
good
earth
as
the
close
of
the
registration
drew
near
the
excitement
was
intensified
letters
to
superintendent
witten
poured
in
asking
him
to
hold
back
claims
for
people
who
were
unable
to
register
the
registration
closed
on
october
no
registrations
would
be
accepted
after
a
certain
hour
captain
yates
assistant
superintendent
of
the
opening
started
from
nebraska
bearing
the
applications
from
that
registration
point
so
that
there
would
be
no
danger
of
his
not
reaching
the
town
of
dallas
with
the
applications
before
the
deadline
a
special
train
was
waiting
for
him
in
his
excitement
captain
yates
rushed
past
the
men
waiting
for
him
crossed
the
track
where
his
special
was
getting
up
steam
and
took
a
train
going
the
wrong
way
telegrams
another
special
train
cleared
tracks
and
he
was
finally
able
to
rush
in
with
his
applications
at
the
last
moment
others
were
not
so
fortunate
tired
horses
a
missed
train
connection
some
unforeseen
delay
and
they
arrived
an
hour
half
an
hour
perhaps
only
a
few
minutes
after
the
registration
had
closed
too
late
oddly
enough
one
of
the
last
to
register
was
the
foreman
of
the
u
cross
ranch
who
came
galloping
across
the
prairie
at
the
last
moment
to
make
his
application
for
a
homestead
and
when
a
ranchman
turned
to
homesteading
that
was
news
on
october
the
drawing
began
the
government
saw
that
every
precaution
must
be
taken
to
make
sure
of
fair
play
any
suspicion
of
illegality
might
cause
an
uprising
of
the
mob
of
a
hundred
thousand
excited
disappointed
people
the
great
cans
were
pried
open
and
the
applications
put
onto
large
platforms
where
they
were
shuffled
and
mixed
symbolically
enough
with
rakes
and
hoes
for
it
was
of
land
they
were
handling
from
out
the
crowd
applicants
were
invited
onto
the
platform
and
if
one
succeeded
in
selecting
his
own
name
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
first
choice
of
land
and
location
business
firms
townsite
companies
were
making
open
offers
of
for
claim
no
then
two
little
girls
blindfolded
drew
the
sealed
envelopes
from
the
deep
pile
superintendent
witten
opened
them
and
announced
the
names
to
the
crowd
filling
the
huge
tent
where
the
drawing
was
held
the
hushed
suspense
of
that
drawing
was
like
that
of
a
regiment
waiting
to
go
over
the
top
the
noisy
excitement
of
registration
was
over
the
people
waited
tense
and
breathless
for
the
numbers
to
be
called
ironically
enough
a
great
number
of
the
winners
had
gone
home
they
would
be
notified
by
mail
of
course
it
was
largely
the
losers
who
had
waited
the
first
winner
to
be
present
as
his
number
was
called
was
greeted
with
generous
applause
and
cheers
and
demands
for
a
speech
he
was
a
farmer
from
oklahoma
and
instead
of
speaking
he
felt
in
his
pockets
and
held
up
with
a
rather
sheepish
smile
a
rabbit
foot
which
he
had
brought
with
him
press
agents
stood
by
waiting
for
the
outcome
daily
newspapers
printed
the
official
list
of
the
winners
as
the
numbers
came
out
and
all
over
the
united
states
people
waited
for
the
announcement
of
the
rosebud
lucky
numbers
the
rosebud
had
been
opened
up
and
swallowed
by
the
advancing
wave
of
people
westward
but
there
was
more
land
fred
farraday
drove
me
home
from
presho
weary
to
the
bone
and
content
to
ride
without
speaking
listening
to
the
steady
of
the
horses
over
that
quiet
road
on
which
we
did
not
meet
a
human
being
and
in
my
pocketbook
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
postcards
something
as
ida
mary
had
predicted
had
happened
ma
wagor
came
in
from
the
store
land
sakes
she
exclaimed
you
musta
been
through
some
confusement
you
look
like
a
ghost
it
did
matter
i
have
four
hundred
dollars
there
will
be
another
hundred
or
so
when
the
agents
finish
checking
up
on
the
card
sales
and
i
get
a
check
from
the
news
service
it
will
pay
the
bills
and
some
left
over
to
help
us
through
the
winter
we
saved
the
claim
after
a
pause
i
added
the
lower
brulé
seems
pretty
small
after
the
rosebud
i
like
to
go
over
there
to
start
a
newspaper
no
said
ida
mary
you
ca
do
that
your
claim
and
your
newspaper
and
your
job
are
here
after
all
anyone
can
file
on
a
claim
it
the
people
who
stay
who
build
the
country
illustration
x
the
harvest
i
was
the
mail
home
one
day
when
i
saw
a
great
eagle
with
wings
spread
flying
low
and
circling
around
as
though
ready
to
swoop
upon
its
prey
it
was
noon
on
a
late
fall
day
with
no
sight
or
sound
of
life
except
that
mammoth
eagle
craftily
soaring
i
turned
off
the
trail
to
follow
its
flight
it
was
the
kind
of
day
when
one
must
ride
off
the
beaten
trail
when
the
sun
is
warm
the
air
cool
and
sparkling
even
lakota
seemed
like
a
stodgy
animal
riveted
to
the
earth
and
the
only
proper
motion
was
that
of
an
eagle
soaring
abruptly
the
eagle
swooped
down
into
the
coulee
out
of
sight
and
came
up
a
hundred
yards
or
so
in
front
of
me
carrying
with
it
a
large
bulky
object
at
the
same
instant
a
shot
rang
out
the
eagle
fell
and
its
bulky
prey
came
down
with
a
thud
so
intent
was
i
upon
the
eagle
that
i
was
not
prepared
for
what
happened
at
the
shot
lakota
gave
a
leap
to
the
right
and
i
went
off
to
the
left
i
had
no
more
than
landed
when
a
rider
whom
i
had
seen
lope
up
out
of
the
coulee
as
the
eagle
fell
had
my
horse
by
the
bit
and
was
bending
over
me
hurt
he
asked
i
do
think
so
just
scared
i
replied
as
i
got
stiffly
to
my
feet
the
soft
thick
grass
had
provided
a
cushioned
landing
place
and
saved
my
bones
the
stranger
took
a
canteen
from
his
saddle
and
gave
me
a
drink
of
water
led
the
horses
up
to
form
a
shade
against
the
bright
noon
sun
and
bade
me
sit
quiet
while
he
went
back
to
see
what
the
eagle
had
swooped
down
upon
a
young
coyote
just
a
pup
he
announced
upon
his
return
i
glad
i
got
that
fellah
they
are
an
awful
pest
it
was
a
big
bird
with
an
stretch
from
wing
tip
to
tip
as
measured
by
this
rule
his
hands
they
carry
away
lambs
and
attack
calves
he
said
they
attack
people
sometimes
but
that
is
rare
he
helped
me
on
my
horse
all
my
fault
could
see
you
from
down
in
the
coulee
when
i
fired
at
that
bird
you
musta
just
tipped
the
ridge
from
the
other
side
he
reached
over
untied
the
mail
bag
and
tied
it
to
his
saddle
you
were
going
the
other
way
were
you
i
protested
no
hurry
i
go
back
with
you
first
you
do
know
where
i
live
do
you
yes
i
know
he
said
laconically
he
was
a
young
man
i
took
him
to
be
under
thirty
with
a
sort
of
agile
strength
in
every
movement
lean
virile
his
skin
sunburnt
and
firm
he
wore
a
flannel
shirt
open
at
the
throat
buckskin
chaps
a
plainsman
boots
and
his
sombrero
was
worn
at
an
angle
he
made
no
attempt
to
be
picturesque
as
did
many
of
the
range
riders
as
the
horses
started
off
at
an
easy
gallop
he
checked
them
better
go
slow
after
that
he
said
quietly
i
must
hurry
i
answered
i
late
with
the
mail
these
homesteaders
are
always
in
a
rush
shore
amusin
act
like
the
flood
would
be
here
tomorrow
and
no
ark
built
he
spoke
in
a
soft
southern
drawl
they
have
to
do
more
than
build
an
ark
i
told
him
they
have
to
make
time
count
the
country
is
too
new
to
accomplish
anything
easily
too
old
you
mean
these
plains
have
been
hyar
too
long
for
a
little
herd
of
humans
to
make
over
in
a
day
we
have
fourteen
months
to
do
it
in
i
reminded
him
referring
to
the
revised
period
you
be
mighty
sore
and
stiff
for
a
few
days
he
said
as
he
laid
the
mail
sack
down
on
the
floor
sorry
miss
i
scared
your
horse
and
touching
his
hat
he
was
gone
where
did
hail
from
ma
wagor
demanded
from
the
store
where
she
had
been
watching
he
not
from
blue
springs
ma
i
declare
you
are
as
tormentin
as
an
indian
when
it
comes
to
finding
out
things
ma
exclaimed
in
disappointment
she
could
understand
how
i
could
have
ridden
any
distance
with
the
man
without
learning
all
about
his
present
guessing
at
his
past
and
disposing
of
his
future
to
suit
myself
people
as
ma
frequently
pointed
out
were
made
to
be
talked
to
just
before
sunset
one
day
a
week
or
so
later
i
was
sitting
in
the
shop
when
the
cowboy
walked
in
got
to
thinkin
you
might
be
hurt
worse
than
you
appeared
to
be
he
said
he
was
top
hand
had
charge
of
a
roundup
outfit
over
in
the
white
river
country
some
fifty
miles
away
and
some
of
the
stock
had
roamed
over
on
the
reservation
name
was
lone
star
lone
star
len
and
then
one
gray
chilly
day
in
november
with
the
first
feathery
snowflakes
he
rode
up
on
his
cow
pony
to
say
he
was
leaving
the
country
taking
a
bunch
of
cattle
down
to
texas
for
winter
range
he
was
glad
to
be
going
do
see
how
folks
can
live
huddled
up
with
somebody
on
every
homesteaders
is
ruinin
the
country
makin
it
a
place
to
live
it
too
doggone
lonesome
with
all
this
millin
around
when
the
brulé
became
populated
lone
star
len
had
gone
into
the
empty
rosebud
country
where
i
not
hemmed
in
by
people
some
place
where
there
a
little
room
now
he
would
be
driven
on
and
on
and
in
the
spring
there
would
be
a
new
influx
of
people
in
our
section
of
the
frontier
meanwhile
fall
had
come
the
plains
which
had
stretched
to
the
horizon
that
spring
untouched
by
a
plow
unoccupied
by
white
men
were
now
unrecognizable
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
fertile
waste
land
had
been
haltered
hundreds
of
settlers
had
transplanted
their
roots
into
this
soil
and
had
made
it
a
thriving
dominion
fall
rains
filled
the
dams
and
creeks
there
were
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
in
abundance
think
of
it
caves
full
of
melons
small
but
sweet
told
of
one
small
field
that
yielded
twenty
bushels
of
wheat
another
bushels
of
oats
to
the
acre
there
was
fall
plowing
of
more
ground
schools
being
established
sunday
schools
preparations
for
the
winter
already
in
progress
never
had
a
raw
primitive
land
seen
such
progress
in
so
short
a
time
and
had
played
a
substantial
part
in
this
development
it
was
swamped
with
letters
of
inquiry
fall
was
roundup
time
on
the
range
the
indian
lands
were
so
that
there
were
no
nearby
ranches
but
the
herds
ranged
over
miles
of
territory
around
us
and
across
the
fence
on
the
unceded
strip
the
great
herds
of
scotty
phillips
outfit
roamed
over
his
own
and
the
indians
holdings
across
the
plains
came
the
ceaseless
bawling
of
thousands
of
cows
and
calves
being
separated
that
wild
mad
pitiful
bawling
rent
the
air
and
could
be
heard
through
the
stillness
of
night
for
miles
around
and
the
yelling
and
whooping
of
cowboys
the
stamping
of
cow
ponies
and
herds
the
chanting
and
of
the
indians
and
enveloping
it
all
the
infinite
plains
unmoved
undisturbed
by
all
that
was
taking
place
upon
them
so
the
homesteaders
gathered
their
first
harvest
and
the
goose
hung
high
there
was
hay
great
stacks
and
ricks
of
it
piles
of
yellow
corn
stacked
like
hay
in
enclosures
or
in
granaries
to
commemorate
that
first
golden
harvest
the
pilgrims
of
the
lower
brulé
celebrated
their
first
thanksgiving
seeing
the
stacks
of
grain
that
stood
ready
for
threshing
or
for
feeding
in
the
straw
old
man
husmann
pointed
to
the
field
mein
gott
in
himmel
vat
i
tell
you
das
oats
made
bushels
an
acre
and
flax
mein
gott
she
grow
on
raw
land
like
hair
on
a
hog
back
back
in
ioway
we
know
notings
about
flax
for
sod
crop
dakota
taught
the
united
states
that
flax
was
the
ideal
sod
crop
the
average
yield
of
oats
with
late
and
slipshod
sowing
had
been
around
fifteen
bushels
to
the
acre
some
fields
of
spring
wheat
had
run
fifteen
bushels
and
potatoes
had
fairly
cracked
the
ground
open
one
settler
an
experienced
potato
grower
had
four
acres
that
yielded
bushels
played
that
up
in
headlines
for
easterners
to
see
melons
lay
on
the
ground
green
and
yellow
watermelons
muskmelons
golden
pumpkins
ready
for
the
thanksgiving
pie
over
the
strip
women
and
children
were
gathering
them
in
against
a
sudden
freeze
the
reservation
fairly
subsisted
on
melons
that
fall
before
the
harvest
the
rations
had
been
getting
slim
with
the
settlers
money
and
food
supply
running
low
women
dried
corn
made
pumpkin
butter
and
watermelon
pickles
and
put
up
chokecherries
a
number
of
them
had
grown
in
their
gardens
a
fruit
they
called
ground
cherries
this
winter
there
would
be
baked
squash
and
pumpkin
pie
so
there
was
food
for
man
and
beast
and
scotty
phillips
who
owned
what
was
said
to
be
the
largest
buffalo
herd
in
america
killed
a
buffalo
and
divided
it
among
the
settlers
as
far
as
it
would
go
to
add
to
the
thanksgiving
cheer
of
the
brulé
there
was
a
genuine
sense
of
fruition
about
that
first
harvest
looking
back
to
the
empty
plains
as
they
had
stretched
that
spring
the
accomplishments
of
the
homesteaders
in
one
brief
summer
were
overwhelming
there
had
been
nothing
but
the
land
now
a
community
had
grown
up
with
houses
and
schools
and
the
ground
had
yielded
abundantly
in
other
ways
our
efforts
had
also
borne
fruit
there
was
to
be
a
new
bridge
at
cedar
creek
from
the
fight
had
carried
on
one
would
think
that
we
were
boring
a
moffat
tunnel
through
the
great
divide
and
fought
a
successful
battle
with
john
bartine
over
county
division
it
had
come
about
when
senator
phillips
came
by
one
day
during
the
summer
on
his
way
from
pierre
to
his
ranch
scotty
phillips
senator
cattleman
and
business
man
was
one
of
the
most
influential
citizens
a
heavyset
man
he
was
with
an
unconscious
dignity
and
a
strong
kindly
face
a
squaw
man
his
wife
was
a
indian
who
had
retained
many
of
her
tribal
habits
one
day
one
would
see
the
senator
ride
past
in
his
big
automobile
and
the
next
day
his
wife
would
go
by
riding
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
on
the
way
to
the
reservation
to
visit
her
relatives
i
stopped
in
to
see
if
you
wanted
to
go
to
the
county
division
meeting
tomorrow
at
presho
senator
phillips
said
it
a
rather
important
matter
to
the
settlers
will
represent
those
of
the
lower
brulé
of
course
what
was
county
division
we
set
out
the
next
morning
to
find
out
the
county
it
appeared
was
becoming
so
thickly
settled
that
the
people
of
the
western
part
wanted
it
divided
with
a
county
seat
of
their
own
we
learned
that
lyman
county
covered
approximately
square
miles
and
the
settlers
of
the
extreme
western
part
were
miles
from
the
county
seat
with
no
means
of
transportation
it
sounded
reasonable
enough
and
backed
those
who
wanted
county
division
the
speaker
for
that
little
meeting
was
a
slight
and
unassuming
young
man
who
was
greeted
with
cheers
who
is
he
i
asked
senator
phillips
why
that
he
said
is
john
bartine
john
bartine
was
one
of
the
most
noted
and
romantic
figures
of
the
western
plains
he
had
come
west
with
a
few
law
books
packed
in
his
trunk
and
no
money
a
young
tenderfoot
lawyer
he
almost
starved
waiting
for
a
case
there
were
no
law
cases
no
real
legal
difficulties
but
cattle
rustling
and
nothing
apparently
that
an
inexperienced
young
easterner
could
do
about
that
but
he
persuaded
stockmen
who
were
being
wiped
out
by
the
depredations
of
the
rustlers
to
let
him
take
their
cases
against
these
outlaw
gangs
he
had
himself
elected
judge
so
that
he
could
convict
the
thieves
and
he
had
convicted
them
right
and
left
until
a
band
of
rustlers
burned
down
the
courthouse
in
retaliation
but
he
kept
on
fighting
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
until
at
last
that
part
of
the
country
became
safe
for
the
cattlemen
after
we
had
heard
him
talk
we
discovered
that
the
county
division
problem
was
not
as
simple
as
it
appeared
at
first
it
was
merely
a
problem
of
dividing
territory
division
would
increase
the
taxes
the
said
we
had
thought
of
that
one
did
not
pay
taxes
on
the
land
of
course
until
he
got
his
deed
but
there
were
other
taxes
to
be
paid
and
the
homesteaders
felt
they
were
developing
resources
for
the
nation
at
their
own
expense
i
did
not
know
how
to
carry
on
a
campaign
like
that
but
put
facts
and
figures
before
the
settlers
to
bring
the
situation
clearly
before
them
and
let
them
do
the
deciding
when
a
frontier
newspaper
ran
out
of
something
to
do
it
could
always
enter
a
county
division
fight
as
there
were
always
counties
to
be
divided
as
soon
as
they
were
settled
up
many
of
them
larger
than
our
smaller
new
england
states
and
so
far
as
my
own
district
was
concerned
i
had
won
this
first
battle
with
judge
bartine
but
the
fight
against
the
measure
was
so
strong
that
lyman
county
was
not
divided
for
several
years
although
the
settlers
had
not
been
on
the
brulé
long
enough
to
vote
office
seekers
kept
coming
through
asking
the
indorsement
of
it
no
wonder
the
men
we
elect
to
run
things
make
such
a
fizzle
when
they
get
into
office
ma
wagor
snorted
one
day
with
impatience
they
wear
themselves
plumb
out
getting
there
old
porcupine
bear
wise
man
and
prophet
warned
us
that
it
would
be
a
hard
winter
and
the
plainsmen
agreed
that
it
was
a
humdinger
i
asked
the
wise
old
indian
how
he
could
foretell
the
winter
by
food
on
shrub
and
tree
he
said
heap
plenty
the
heavy
coat
of
the
animals
the
bear
and
squirrel
storing
heap
much
for
eat
and
the
bear
he
get
ready
go
sleep
early
and
so
the
winter
came
on
us
the
dams
froze
over
and
the
strip
was
a
great
white
expanse
which
appeared
level
at
first
sight
but
was
beautifully
undulating
now
there
was
a
shack
on
every
which
appeared
black
in
relief
against
the
white
the
atmosphere
did
curious
things
to
them
sometimes
they
looked
like
small
boxes
in
the
distance
sometimes
they
seemed
to
have
moved
up
to
the
very
door
a
coyote
off
a
mile
or
two
or
a
bunch
of
antelope
running
along
a
ridge
in
the
distance
appeared
to
be
just
across
the
trail
in
the
mornings
we
cut
a
hole
in
the
ice
of
our
dam
to
dip
out
the
water
for
household
use
and
then
led
the
livestock
down
to
drink
and
at
night
we
went
skating
on
the
larger
dams
with
the
stars
so
large
and
near
it
seemed
one
could
reach
up
and
touch
them
and
no
sound
on
the
sleeping
prairie
but
the
howling
of
a
pack
of
wolves
down
in
the
next
draw
but
there
were
tracks
on
the
white
floor
of
earth
tracks
of
the
living
things
which
inhabit
the
silent
areas
and
which
had
stealthily
traveled
across
the
plains
sometimes
tracks
of
the
larger
wild
beasts
and
everywhere
jack
rabbits
squatted
deep
in
the
snow
the
majority
of
the
settlers
wintered
in
little
hovels
of
single
thin
board
walls
the
boards
often
sprung
apart
and
cracked
by
the
dry
winds
a
thin
layer
of
tar
paper
outside
and
a
layer
of
building
paper
on
the
inside
which
as
a
rule
was
stretched
across
the
studding
to
provide
insulation
between
the
wall
and
lining
some
of
these
paper
linings
were
thin
and
light
the
average
settler
having
to
buy
the
cheapest
grade
he
could
find
we
got
along
fairly
well
unless
the
wind
blew
the
tar
paper
off
there
was
not
a
tree
not
a
of
any
kind
for
protection
sometimes
the
wind
coming
in
a
clean
sweep
would
riddle
the
tar
paper
and
take
it
in
great
sheets
across
the
prairie
so
fast
no
one
could
catch
up
with
it
the
covering
on
our
shack
had
seen
its
best
days
and
went
ripping
off
at
the
least
provocation
with
plenty
of
fuel
one
could
get
along
fairly
well
unless
the
tar
paper
was
torn
off
in
strips
leaving
the
cracks
and
knotholes
open
then
we
had
to
stop
up
the
holes
with
anything
we
had
and
patch
the
paper
as
best
we
could
we
had
our
piano
out
there
that
winter
and
ida
mary
bought
a
heating
stove
for
the
front
room
the
ammons
girls
are
riding
high
some
of
the
settlers
said
but
when
the
stove
the
cheapest
listed
in
the
catalog
arrived
ida
mary
cried
with
disappointment
and
then
began
to
laugh
it
was
so
small
we
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
a
round
heater
or
a
bulge
in
the
stovepipe
with
it
the
temperature
of
the
room
ran
automatically
from
roasting
to
freezing
point
unless
one
kept
stoking
in
fuel
in
some
ways
ida
mary
and
i
remained
objects
of
curiosity
occasionally
we
saw
indications
of
it
there
had
been
a
hot
sunday
afternoon
during
the
summer
when
ida
mary
and
i
were
sitting
in
the
open
door
of
the
shack
a
strange
cowboy
rode
up
to
the
door
is
this
the
place
where
the
newspaper
and
everything
is
we
told
him
that
it
was
he
threw
one
leg
over
the
saddlehorn
and
fanned
himself
with
his
sombrero
looking
us
over
gaudy
in
a
red
and
black
checkered
shirt
fringed
leather
chaps
and
bright
green
neckerchief
well
you
ai
the
ones
i
heard
about
that
runnin
it
are
you
he
seemed
puzzled
yes
we
were
the
ones
anything
he
wanted
no
i
a
new
wrangler
over
on
bad
horse
creek
i
come
from
montana
montana
joe
they
call
me
and
a
bunch
of
the
punchers
was
just
a
wondering
what
you
looked
like
wanted
me
to
come
over
and
find
out
he
admitted
candidly
but
and
he
stared
disapprovingly
at
our
slippered
feet
them
look
like
range
hoofs
to
me
they
look
like
ramblin
rosie
rosie
it
appeared
was
a
notorious
girl
and
about
that
time
a
chicago
newspaper
came
out
carrying
a
big
headline
story
complete
with
drawings
about
our
adventures
in
taming
the
frontier
it
pictured
ida
mary
and
me
with
chaps
and
running
off
our
land
and
fighting
indians
practically
plowing
the
land
in
overalls
two
large
buxom
hardy
girls
in
fact
it
had
us
shooting
and
tearing
up
the
west
in
general
a
friend
sent
us
a
copy
and
we
laughed
over
it
hysterically
marveling
at
this
transformation
of
two
girls
who
were
both
as
timid
as
field
mice
into
amazons
we
hid
it
quickly
so
that
no
one
could
see
it
and
forgot
about
it
until
long
afterwards
but
we
were
the
only
girls
on
the
plains
with
problems
a
surprising
number
of
homesteaders
were
girls
who
had
come
alone
they
had
a
purpose
in
being
there
with
the
proceeds
of
a
homestead
they
could
finish
their
education
or
go
into
business
many
of
these
girls
came
from
sheltered
homes
and
settled
out
in
the
wilderness
of
plains
living
alone
in
little
isolated
shanties
out
of
reach
of
human
aid
in
case
of
illness
or
other
emergency
they
had
no
telephones
or
other
means
of
communication
some
of
them
had
no
means
of
transportation
walking
miles
to
a
neighbor
in
order
to
send
to
town
for
a
little
food
or
fuel
sometimes
carrying
buckets
of
water
a
mile
or
two
over
the
plains
in
winter
they
were
marooned
for
days
and
nights
at
a
stretch
without
a
human
being
to
whom
they
could
speak
and
nothing
but
the
bloodcurdling
cry
of
coyotes
at
night
to
keep
them
company
they
tried
to
prepare
themselves
for
any
situation
so
that
they
would
neither
starve
nor
freeze
with
books
and
papers
to
read
and
the
daily
grinding
routine
of
work
to
be
done
on
every
homestead
where
each
job
required
the
effort
and
time
of
ten
in
modern
surroundings
they
managed
to
be
contented
but
it
took
courage
in
spite
of
the
rigors
of
the
winter
the
settlers
made
merry
our
piano
was
hauled
all
over
the
strip
for
entertainments
barring
storms
or
other
obstacles
it
was
brought
home
the
next
day
perhaps
not
quite
as
good
as
when
it
went
but
a
piano
scuffed
or
did
not
matter
compared
to
the
pleasure
ida
mary
had
that
winter
going
to
parties
and
dancing
i
did
not
always
go
along
my
strength
did
seem
to
stretch
far
enough
sometimes
a
group
of
homesteaders
would
drive
up
to
the
settlement
about
sundown
in
a
big
bobsled
behind
four
horses
the
sled
filled
with
hay
heavy
blankets
and
hot
bricks
we
would
shut
up
shop
and
the
whole
staff
would
crowd
into
the
sled
imbert
tucking
ida
mary
in
warm
and
snug
on
cold
winter
evenings
when
a
pall
encircled
the
earth
like
a
mantle
of
desolation
three
or
four
of
the
girls
were
likely
to
ride
up
each
with
a
bag
of
cooked
food
to
spend
the
night
one
never
waited
to
be
invited
to
a
friend
house
but
it
was
a
custom
of
the
homestead
country
to
take
along
one
own
grub
or
run
the
risk
of
going
hungry
it
might
be
the
time
when
the
flour
barrel
was
empty
so
our
guests
would
bring
a
jar
of
baked
beans
a
pan
of
fresh
rolls
potato
salad
or
a
pie
and
possibly
a
jack
rabbit
ready
baked
jack
rabbit
was
the
main
kind
of
fresh
meat
with
grouse
in
season
we
had
not
as
yet
been
reduced
to
eating
prairie
dog
as
the
indians
did
breaking
winter
quarantine
the
girls
would
announce
as
they
rode
up
late
in
the
evening
we
brought
in
the
ladder
opened
up
the
small
square
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
our
guests
ascended
to
the
attic
on
the
floor
next
to
the
hole
was
a
mattress
made
of
clean
sweet
prairie
hay
our
guest
climbed
the
ladder
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
mattress
feet
dangling
down
through
the
cubbyhole
until
she
undressed
and
then
tumbled
over
onto
the
bed
the
attic
was
entirely
too
low
to
attempt
a
standing
posture
on
one
such
night
with
three
girls
stowed
away
in
the
attic
we
lay
in
bed
singing
hello
hello
there
came
an
urgent
call
we
peered
through
the
frosted
window
trying
to
see
through
the
driving
snow
and
made
out
a
man
on
horseback
i
on
my
way
to
pierre
and
i
am
lost
i
am
trying
to
reach
the
cedar
creek
settlement
for
the
night
you
ca
make
it
stranger
if
you
do
know
the
country
ida
mary
called
out
well
what
have
i
struck
he
asked
perplexed
a
trading
post
a
trading
post
it
sounded
like
an
opera
house
we
do
know
who
you
are
ida
mary
called
through
the
thin
wall
of
the
shack
but
you
ca
get
on
tonight
in
this
snow
tie
your
horse
in
the
hayshed
and
we
will
fix
you
a
bed
in
the
store
next
morning
the
girls
rolled
down
the
ladder
one
at
a
time
clothes
in
hand
to
dress
by
the
toy
stove
while
ida
mary
and
i
started
the
wheels
of
industry
rolling
when
breakfast
was
ready
we
called
in
our
strange
guest
when
he
asked
for
his
bill
we
told
him
we
were
not
running
public
lodgings
but
that
we
took
in
strangers
when
it
was
dangerous
for
them
to
go
on
after
that
ida
mary
always
left
a
lamp
burning
low
in
the
kitchen
window
and
the
little
print
shop
set
on
the
high
tableland
served
as
a
beacon
for
travelers
who
were
lost
on
the
plains
many
a
night
stranded
strangers
sought
shelter
at
the
ammons
settlement
no
other
trading
center
in
the
middle
of
a
reservation
was
run
by
girls
so
strangers
took
it
for
granted
that
there
were
men
about
or
if
they
knew
we
were
alone
they
did
not
think
of
our
being
unarmed
in
that
country
where
guns
had
been
the
law
once
we
decided
we
should
have
a
watchdog
around
ida
mary
traded
a
bright
scarf
and
some
cigarettes
for
two
indian
mongrels
they
were
lean
and
lopeared
and
starved
the
only
way
they
ever
would
halt
an
intruder
was
by
his
falling
down
over
them
not
knowing
they
were
there
and
they
swallowed
food
like
alligators
van
leshout
named
them
eat
and
sleep
in
indignation
ida
mary
returned
them
to
their
owners
what
was
the
matter
they
wanted
to
know
no
barkum
no
bitem
ida
mary
explained
and
she
tied
them
firmly
to
the
back
of
the
first
indian
wagon
headed
for
the
indian
settlement
and
gave
up
the
idea
of
a
dog
for
protection
however
women
were
probably
safer
in
the
homestead
section
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
women
had
been
scarce
there
and
they
met
with
invariable
respect
wherever
they
went
it
was
practically
unheard
of
for
a
solitary
woman
to
be
molested
in
any
fashion
both
men
and
women
came
through
the
strip
that
winter
looking
for
friends
or
relatives
who
had
claims
or
in
quest
of
land
often
they
could
get
no
farther
than
the
print
shop
by
nightfall
and
never
was
any
such
person
refused
food
or
shelter
ida
mary
went
around
that
winter
with
one
of
the
city
boys
though
she
still
saw
imbert
we
take
each
other
too
much
for
granted
she
said
i
been
dependent
upon
him
for
companionship
and
diversion
and
help
in
many
ways
for
his
sake
and
mine
i
must
know
that
it
more
than
that
i
can
not
recall
that
we
ever
planned
ahead
of
proving
up
on
the
claim
we
measured
life
by
time
only
the
dirt
farmers
planned
ahead
and
ma
wagor
who
was
an
inveterate
matchmaker
i
can
see
her
now
driving
across
the
plains
holding
her
head
as
high
as
that
of
the
spotted
pony
she
drove
a
pony
which
though
blind
as
a
bat
held
its
head
in
the
air
like
a
giraffe
often
she
would
stay
with
us
at
night
pa
wo
mind
he
got
plenty
of
biscuit
left
she
would
say
the
cow
give
two
gallons
of
milk
today
and
he
got
and
the
blue
springs
paper
to
read
but
sometimes
when
business
had
kept
her
from
home
for
two
or
three
days
or
we
needed
her
she
would
gaze
out
of
the
window
watching
for
him
and
it
got
colder
getting
the
mail
back
and
forth
to
the
stage
line
became
a
major
problem
it
appears
to
me
said
ma
like
a
post
office
is
as
pestiferous
a
job
as
a
newspaper
but
ma
never
admitted
anything
pestiferous
about
running
the
store
the
post
office
receipts
picked
up
mail
bags
were
jammed
with
letters
written
by
the
settlers
through
long
lonely
evenings
the
profits
helped
to
pull
us
through
as
the
newspaper
business
slumped
to
almost
nothing
during
the
period
the
financial
operations
of
the
trading
post
in
fact
rose
and
fell
like
a
wall
street
market
we
struggled
through
sharp
wintry
squalls
to
the
stage
line
with
the
laden
sacks
of
mail
and
realized
that
when
the
winter
really
set
in
we
would
never
be
able
to
make
it
so
dave
dykstra
was
appointed
he
was
a
homesteader
who
taught
the
mcclure
school
that
winter
a
slim
chap
rather
frail
in
physique
dave
would
never
set
the
world
on
fire
but
he
would
keep
it
going
around
regularly
blizzard
rain
or
sun
he
came
to
the
post
office
every
morning
those
short
winter
days
before
it
was
light
at
night
ida
mary
as
postmistress
would
lock
the
mail
sack
and
carry
it
into
the
cabin
in
the
morning
we
would
hear
dave
horse
striking
the
ground
and
one
of
us
would
leap
to
the
icy
floor
wrap
up
in
a
heavy
blanket
stick
our
feet
into
moccasins
some
nights
we
slept
in
them
open
the
door
a
foot
or
so
and
hold
out
the
mail
bag
dave
would
grab
it
on
the
run
one
who
has
never
tried
it
has
no
idea
what
that
feat
meant
in
a
shell
of
a
hut
with
the
temperature
ten
or
twenty
degrees
below
zero
freezing
one
breath
in
the
performance
we
used
to
hope
dave
would
oversleep
or
that
his
coffee
would
fail
to
boil
so
that
we
might
have
a
few
more
moments
to
sleep
the
indians
were
always
underfoot
the
great
cold
did
not
keep
them
away
men
sauntered
around
trading
loafing
women
sat
on
the
floor
papooses
on
their
backs
beadwork
in
hand
our
trade
was
extended
to
indian
shawls
blankets
moccasins
and
furs
for
which
the
post
found
ready
and
profitable
markets
ida
mary
became
an
adept
at
indian
trading
by
that
time
we
had
a
smattering
of
the
sioux
language
although
we
were
never
really
expert
at
it
it
did
not
require
much
to
trade
with
the
indians
often
they
turned
their
horses
loose
built
campfires
and
spent
the
day
they
rolled
a
prairie
dog
in
the
wet
earth
roasted
it
in
the
fire
and
invited
us
to
eat
they
brought
us
dog
meat
there
was
a
time
when
we
actually
swallowed
it
because
we
were
afraid
to
refuse
but
now
we
shook
our
heads
it
was
season
and
women
came
sitting
flat
on
the
back
end
of
loads
among
the
indian
women
were
a
few
with
primitive
intelligence
and
wisdom
others
were
morose
and
taciturn
even
during
the
enforced
lull
of
the
deep
winter
there
seemed
to
be
much
to
do
and
the
routine
duties
of
the
post
office
and
appeared
to
require
most
of
our
time
the
opportunity
to
study
to
know
the
sioux
was
at
hand
but
we
never
took
advantage
of
it
like
most
people
we
were
too
busy
with
the
little
things
to
see
the
possibilities
around
us
perhaps
alexander
van
leshout
who
made
a
success
of
his
indian
art
came
to
know
these
people
better
than
any
of
us
but
he
was
an
artist
and
therefore
he
refused
to
let
the
little
things
clutter
up
his
life
and
take
his
attention
from
the
one
thing
that
was
important
to
him
seeing
clearly
and
honestly
the
world
about
him
when
the
indians
got
their
government
pay
they
celebrated
with
a
buying
spree
they
were
lavish
buyers
as
long
as
they
had
a
cent
and
they
bought
the
goods
that
had
the
most
alluring
picture
on
can
or
box
ida
mary
would
hold
up
something
of
staple
quality
but
they
would
shake
their
heads
and
turn
to
something
gaudily
wrapped
old
and
a
few
others
paid
their
yearly
subscriptions
to
every
time
they
got
their
government
allotment
your
subscription
is
already
paid
i
would
explain
but
they
would
shake
their
heads
and
mutter
this
was
their
newspaper
too
the
thing
that
had
signs
and
their
own
names
printed
on
a
machine
they
had
the
right
to
trade
beadwork
or
another
dollar
for
it
any
time
they
liked
our
subscription
list
looked
like
a
sioux
directory
with
such
names
as
julia
lame
walking
eagle
maggie
shoots
at
head
afraid
of
his
horses
paul
owns
the
fire
and
his
son
owns
the
fire
our
daily
visitors
were
the
rank
and
file
of
the
tribe
although
famous
old
warriors
and
medicine
men
came
now
and
then
the
high
rulers
of
the
brulé
who
were
among
the
most
reserved
and
intelligent
of
all
american
indians
did
not
come
in
this
manner
but
any
negotiations
between
the
brulé
whites
and
the
brulé
red
men
were
made
with
their
chief
and
council
a
few
of
the
indian
warriors
and
chiefs
always
would
hate
the
whites
but
the
rank
and
file
of
the
brulés
were
enjoying
the
strange
new
life
about
them
while
they
saw
no
advantage
in
an
active
life
for
themselves
they
found
activity
in
others
highly
entertaining
the
weather
with
its
dry
cold
was
sometimes
deceptive
for
several
days
we
had
had
urgent
business
to
attend
to
in
presho
but
the
weather
prohibited
the
trip
one
morning
we
awoke
to
see
the
sun
brilliant
on
the
snow
a
lovely
day
for
the
long
trip
and
we
hitched
the
team
to
a
light
buggy
so
that
we
might
wrap
up
better
the
farther
we
drove
the
colder
we
became
there
was
no
warmth
in
that
dazzling
sun
we
huddled
down
as
near
as
possible
to
the
hot
bricks
we
took
turns
driving
one
of
us
wrapped
up
head
and
ears
beneath
the
heavy
robes
on
that
whole
journey
we
did
not
meet
a
soul
we
were
frozen
stiff
and
had
to
have
our
hands
thawed
out
in
cold
water
when
we
reached
presho
a
homesteader
living
ten
miles
out
stepped
into
the
land
office
while
we
were
there
do
you
girls
know
enough
to
stay
at
home
on
a
day
like
this
i
did
dare
attempt
it
until
i
saw
you
go
by
i
said
to
the
family
go
the
ammons
girls
so
i
hitched
up
and
started
and
here
it
is
below
zero
the
land
commissioner
said
well
you
ca
depend
on
the
ammons
girls
as
a
thermometer
and
the
storms
came
illustration
xi
the
big
blizzard
several
miles
from
ammons
a
bachelor
gave
a
venison
dinner
on
his
claim
to
which
a
little
group
of
us
had
gone
about
noon
it
clouded
up
and
no
barometer
was
needed
to
tell
us
that
a
big
storm
was
on
the
way
as
soon
as
we
had
eaten
we
started
home
the
sky
was
ominous
antelope
went
fleeting
by
a
little
herd
of
horses
heads
high
went
snorting
over
the
prairie
coyotes
and
rabbits
were
running
to
shelter
and
a
drove
of
cattle
belonging
to
the
phillips
ranch
were
on
a
stampede
one
could
hear
them
bawling
madly
the
guests
had
gone
to
the
dinner
together
in
a
big
wagon
and
were
delivered
to
their
respective
shacks
on
the
way
back
we
raced
the
horses
ahead
of
the
storm
for
a
mile
or
two
but
it
was
upon
us
by
the
time
we
reached
margaret
houlihan
as
we
drove
on
up
the
draw
to
the
settlement
we
saw
the
chimney
of
our
cabin
consisting
of
a
joint
of
stovepipe
the
regulation
chimney
in
this
country
go
flying
across
the
prairie
and
there
was
not
an
extra
joint
of
pipe
on
the
place
probably
not
one
on
the
reservation
which
meant
that
we
would
not
be
able
to
build
a
fire
in
the
house
until
we
could
go
to
presho
or
the
state
capital
for
a
joint
hey
whata
you
goin
to
do
exclaimed
the
young
neighbor
boy
who
had
taken
us
to
the
dinner
you
ca
live
in
your
shack
through
the
storm
that
comin
without
a
fire
we
have
a
in
the
store
ida
mary
told
him
he
shook
his
head
but
before
hurrying
home
he
scooped
up
a
few
buckets
of
coal
we
had
on
hand
and
took
it
into
the
store
and
watered
and
fed
the
horses
knowing
we
might
not
be
able
to
reach
them
until
the
blizzard
had
passed
that
all
the
fuel
you
got
he
demanded
a
settler
went
to
town
this
morning
to
get
coal
for
us
but
he
ca
get
back
until
the
storm
is
over
how
you
goin
to
manage
no
fire
in
your
shack
no
fuel
for
the
we
be
all
right
we
assured
him
he
was
not
convinced
but
he
dared
not
linger
he
had
to
get
home
while
he
could
still
find
the
way
in
thirty
minutes
we
were
completely
shut
in
by
the
lashing
force
of
wind
and
snow
that
swept
across
the
plains
in
a
blinding
rage
ma
wagor
and
kathryn
our
typesetter
had
gone
home
and
we
were
alone
ida
mary
and
i
we
built
up
a
hot
fire
in
the
which
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
store
building
and
was
used
for
heating
both
store
and
print
shop
from
canned
goods
on
the
shelf
baked
beans
and
corned
beef
we
prepared
a
sketchy
supper
and
ate
on
the
counter
although
it
had
been
without
heat
only
a
few
hours
the
shack
was
already
like
an
iceberg
and
we
were
shaking
with
cold
by
the
time
we
managed
to
drag
the
couch
out
of
it
with
a
mighty
effort
and
into
the
store
it
was
warm
there
and
we
lay
safe
under
warm
blankets
listening
tranquilly
to
the
storm
hurling
its
strength
furiously
against
the
frail
defense
of
the
little
store
the
shriek
of
the
wind
the
beating
of
the
snow
on
the
roof
it
must
be
horrible
to
be
out
in
it
we
thought
pleasantly
aware
of
protection
and
warmth
and
safety
next
morning
there
was
a
real
blizzard
raging
we
could
barely
see
the
outline
of
the
shack
ten
feet
from
the
store
the
rest
of
the
world
was
blotted
out
and
the
wind
roared
like
an
incoming
tide
as
the
snow
and
sleet
pelted
like
shot
on
the
low
roof
a
primeval
force
drove
the
storm
before
it
all
over
the
plains
people
were
hemmed
in
shacks
the
world
diminished
for
them
to
the
dimensions
of
their
houses
as
alone
as
though
each
were
the
only
dweller
on
the
prairie
the
team
fan
and
bill
and
lakota
were
the
only
horses
tied
up
in
the
hay
barn
they
could
reach
the
hay
and
eat
snow
for
water
there
would
be
plenty
of
snow
our
menagerie
of
indian
plugs
including
pinto
was
loose
on
the
plains
but
they
were
accustomed
to
battling
storms
in
the
open
and
there
were
haystacks
now
to
provide
food
and
shelter
somewhere
in
the
open
they
were
standing
huddled
together
facing
the
onslaught
of
the
storm
the
west
end
wall
of
the
flimsy
ell
print
shop
exposed
to
the
full
force
of
the
storm
was
swaying
in
together
we
dragged
forth
some
boxes
of
canned
goods
heavy
cans
of
lard
and
molasses
and
propped
it
with
their
weight
we
watched
anxiously
for
a
time
but
the
heavy
boxes
seemed
to
provide
sufficient
support
there
were
no
further
signs
of
the
wall
collapsing
by
evening
the
storm
had
gripped
the
plains
like
a
demon
of
wrath
we
had
been
rather
enjoying
this
seclusion
no
indians
and
we
chuckled
like
a
victim
of
persecution
whose
persecutor
had
been
overtaken
there
would
be
no
mail
carrier
in
the
morning
no
mail
to
be
taken
care
of
exultant
we
tried
to
figure
how
many
days
dave
would
be
blockaded
and
we
would
be
spared
that
morning
penance
of
handing
the
mail
sack
out
from
the
icy
shack
on
the
second
morning
the
storm
was
still
raging
with
the
snow
two
feet
deep
between
the
store
and
the
barn
the
west
wall
still
held
and
between
glances
at
it
we
stoked
the
stoked
it
while
the
coal
dwindled
when
the
last
chunk
had
been
swallowed
up
we
hunted
around
for
something
else
to
burn
newspapers
cartons
wooden
boxes
everything
we
could
find
went
into
the
voracious
maw
of
the
stove
we
tended
it
as
religiously
as
priestesses
at
an
altar
or
as
primitive
men
building
up
a
fire
to
keep
off
wild
animals
only
under
such
conditions
does
one
fully
experience
that
elemental
worship
of
fire
it
literally
meant
life
to
us
searching
for
something
else
we
could
burn
something
else
to
keep
that
flame
going
even
a
little
while
longer
that
pleasant
glow
which
had
come
with
our
sense
of
protection
gradually
disappeared
the
blizzard
was
not
merely
a
gigantic
spectacle
put
on
by
nature
for
our
entertainment
it
was
a
menace
to
be
kept
at
bay
only
by
constant
alertness
on
our
part
now
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
store
that
we
could
burn
the
indians
brought
some
fence
posts
ida
mary
recalled
they
are
back
of
the
barn
where
they
unloaded
them
we
have
to
get
them
we
put
on
our
coats
pulled
fur
caps
close
down
around
our
faces
and
ears
wrapped
gunny
sacks
around
our
feet
and
legs
over
high
arctics
to
serve
as
snowshoes
it
took
our
combined
strength
to
push
the
door
open
against
the
storm
before
we
could
close
it
behind
us
snow
had
swept
into
the
store
and
was
making
little
mounds
clinging
to
each
other
we
plowed
our
way
through
the
loose
snow
to
the
fence
posts
and
dragged
in
a
few
making
two
trips
breaking
a
trail
with
them
as
we
went
the
snow
cut
our
faces
like
points
of
steel
hearing
the
restless
whinny
of
the
horses
we
stopped
to
untie
them
they
would
not
go
far
from
shelter
naturally
the
fence
posts
were
much
too
long
to
go
into
the
stove
and
we
had
no
way
of
chopping
them
up
so
we
lifted
up
a
cap
of
the
stove
and
stuck
one
end
of
a
post
into
the
fire
propped
the
other
end
up
against
the
counter
and
fed
the
fire
by
automatic
control
when
one
post
burned
down
to
the
end
we
stuck
in
another
it
seemed
to
us
that
they
burned
awfully
fast
and
that
the
store
was
getting
colder
and
colder
we
put
on
our
heavy
coats
for
warmth
and
finally
our
overshoes
storm
or
no
storm
however
had
to
be
printed
we
pulled
the
into
the
store
close
to
the
stove
in
those
heavy
coats
and
overshoes
we
went
to
work
on
the
newspaper
and
that
issue
was
one
of
the
best
we
ever
published
in
those
two
long
nights
shut
off
from
all
the
world
we
talked
and
planned
we
dared
not
take
the
risk
of
going
to
bed
if
we
should
sleep
and
let
the
fire
go
out
we
were
apt
to
freeze
so
we
huddled
around
the
stove
punching
fence
posts
down
into
the
fire
watching
the
blaze
flicker
at
least
there
was
time
to
look
ahead
time
to
think
time
to
weigh
what
we
had
done
and
what
we
wanted
to
do
so
that
week
came
out
with
ideas
for
cooperative
action
that
were
an
innovation
in
the
development
of
new
lands
a
banded
strength
for
the
protection
it
seemed
logical
and
simple
and
inevitable
to
me
then
as
it
does
now
banded
together
as
friends
the
indian
meaning
of
lakota
was
the
underlying
theme
of
what
i
wanted
to
tell
the
homesteaders
the
strength
and
the
potentialities
of
one
settler
counted
for
little
but
banded
together
our
enthusiasm
in
planning
and
talking
carried
us
through
most
of
that
day
but
toward
evening
there
were
more
immediate
problems
it
began
to
turn
bitter
cold
the
very
air
was
freezing
up
it
was
no
longer
snowing
but
the
wind
had
picked
up
the
snow
and
whirled
it
over
the
prairie
into
high
drifts
that
in
places
covered
up
the
fences
against
which
it
piled
and
under
the
piling
snow
our
fuel
lay
buried
a
long
windrow
drift
had
piled
high
between
the
posts
and
the
shop
and
the
shop
was
growing
colder
and
colder
even
with
the
heavy
coats
and
overshoes
we
stamped
our
feet
to
keep
out
the
chill
and
huddled
over
the
dying
fire
it
would
soon
be
freezing
cold
in
the
store
as
cold
as
the
icy
shack
which
we
had
abandoned
no
wonder
people
worshiped
fire
there
was
no
sense
of
snug
protection
against
the
storm
now
it
seemed
to
have
invaded
the
store
although
the
west
wall
still
held
have
to
go
somewhere
for
warmth
ida
mary
decided
margaret
shack
was
the
nearest
but
even
so
we
knew
the
grave
risk
we
took
of
perishing
on
the
way
there
action
however
is
nearly
always
easier
than
inaction
a
time
or
two
we
stuck
our
heads
out
of
the
door
and
the
cold
fairly
froze
our
breath
once
i
went
outside
and
when
i
tried
to
get
back
into
the
shack
the
wind
sucking
between
the
few
buildings
blew
me
back
as
though
an
iron
hand
held
me
if
we
stay
here
we
thought
we
may
be
walled
in
by
morning
by
the
snow
so
we
decided
on
margaret
a
down
the
draw
the
chief
difficulty
was
that
the
trip
must
be
made
against
the
storm
and
we
did
not
know
whether
we
could
make
it
or
not
we
each
wrapped
up
tightly
in
a
heavy
indian
shawl
tied
ourselves
together
with
a
light
blanket
picked
up
the
scoop
shovel
and
started
down
the
buried
trail
out
through
the
side
door
and
the
narrow
space
between
the
buildings
which
had
been
protected
against
the
drifts
we
made
our
way
then
facing
the
full
strength
of
the
storm
we
dug
our
way
shoveling
as
we
went
through
a
drift
that
had
piled
in
front
of
the
buildings
and
on
through
the
deep
level
of
snow
it
was
getting
dark
now
the
sudden
that
envelops
the
plains
early
on
a
winter
night
and
closes
in
around
the
white
stretches
holding
them
in
a
vise
the
only
sign
of
life
in
the
whole
blanketed
world
was
the
faint
glimmer
of
light
in
margaret
window
we
knew
now
how
the
light
in
the
print
shop
must
have
looked
many
a
night
to
strangers
lost
on
the
prairie
in
a
storm
such
lightweights
were
we
that
at
every
step
we
took
the
wind
blew
us
back
we
used
all
our
force
pushing
against
that
heavy
wall
of
wind
until
we
struck
drifts
that
almost
buried
us
for
all
our
clumsy
tying
the
blanket
held
us
together
or
we
would
have
lost
each
other
we
could
not
speak
because
if
we
so
much
as
parted
our
lips
they
seemed
to
freeze
to
our
teeth
and
the
cold
wind
rasped
in
our
throats
and
lungs
as
though
we
had
been
running
for
a
very
long
time
had
the
snow
been
tightly
packed
we
could
never
have
dug
our
way
out
of
some
of
the
drifts
but
it
had
been
picked
up
and
swirled
around
so
much
by
the
wind
that
it
was
loose
and
light
it
blew
up
off
the
ground
lashed
against
our
faces
like
sharp
knives
and
blinded
us
how
horrible
we
had
thought
from
the
shelter
of
the
store
to
be
out
in
the
storm
but
we
had
tasted
then
the
malignant
fury
of
the
thing
battling
with
us
for
every
step
we
made
at
last
we
turned
and
walked
backwards
resting
on
the
shovel
handle
for
fear
we
would
fall
from
exhaustion
every
few
steps
we
looked
around
to
see
whether
we
were
still
going
in
a
straight
line
toward
the
dim
light
that
shone
like
a
frosted
glimmer
from
the
tiny
shack
which
now
looked
like
a
dark
blur
we
realized
that
if
we
were
to
swerve
a
few
feet
in
either
direction
so
that
we
lost
sight
of
the
lamp
we
would
not
find
margaret
shack
that
night
it
was
quite
dark
now
and
no
sound
on
the
prairie
but
the
triumphant
howl
of
the
wind
and
the
dry
crunch
of
our
overshoes
on
the
snow
slipping
stumbling
we
were
pushing
ourselves
on
but
our
feet
were
so
numb
it
was
almost
impossible
to
walk
we
had
been
doing
it
for
hours
it
seemed
we
had
always
been
fighting
our
way
through
the
deep
snow
the
store
we
had
left
seemed
as
unreal
as
though
we
had
never
known
its
protection
ida
mary
still
walking
backwards
stumbled
and
fell
she
had
struck
margaret
shack
i
pushed
against
the
door
too
numb
to
turn
the
knob
the
door
opened
and
margaret
with
a
cry
pulled
us
in
swiftly
she
unbundled
us
taking
care
not
to
bring
us
near
the
fire
she
took
off
our
gloves
and
overshoes
then
ran
to
the
door
and
scooped
up
a
basin
of
snow
for
our
numb
hands
and
feet
snow
which
felt
curiously
warm
and
comforting
while
the
snow
drew
out
the
frost
she
hastened
about
making
strong
hot
tea
while
we
drank
the
tea
and
felt
warmth
slowly
creeping
over
us
why
on
earth
did
you
attempt
to
come
here
on
a
night
like
this
she
demanded
you
might
have
frozen
to
death
we
were
out
of
fuel
we
told
her
we
had
to
take
the
chance
the
shack
was
cheerful
and
warm
there
was
a
hot
supper
and
fuel
enough
to
last
through
the
storm
only
a
refuge
for
which
one
has
fought
as
ida
mary
and
i
fought
to
reach
that
shack
could
seem
as
warm
and
safe
as
margaret
shack
seemed
to
us
that
night
in
a
numb
delicious
lethargy
we
sat
around
the
stove
too
tired
and
contented
to
move
safe
from
the
fury
of
the
wind
we
listened
to
it
raging
about
the
cabin
as
though
cheated
of
its
victims
and
then
toward
midnight
it
died
away
there
was
a
hush
as
though
the
night
were
holding
its
breath
and
then
the
sky
cleared
the
stars
came
out
the
next
day
margaret
brother
took
up
a
sack
of
coal
on
his
bronco
so
we
made
our
way
back
over
the
trail
we
had
broken
the
night
before
to
the
store
and
he
built
a
fire
for
us
later
that
same
morning
chris
rode
over
with
a
sack
of
coal
tied
on
behind
the
saddle
yoost
in
case
you
should
run
out
once
he
said
as
he
brought
it
in
my
wife
she
bane
uneasy
when
she
see
no
light
last
night
when
we
told
him
what
had
happened
he
shook
his
head
in
concern
and
went
to
work
he
scooped
a
path
to
the
barn
and
attended
to
the
horses
from
under
the
snow
he
got
some
fence
posts
which
he
chopped
up
while
charlie
excavated
an
opening
to
the
front
door
in
case
anyone
should
be
mad
enough
to
try
to
reach
the
store
on
a
day
like
that
about
noon
a
cowboy
came
fighting
his
way
through
the
drifts
in
search
of
lost
cattle
which
the
storm
must
have
driven
in
this
direction
the
only
soul
who
dared
to
cross
the
plains
that
day
it
was
sourdough
i
never
knew
his
real
name
i
doubt
if
those
with
or
for
whom
he
worked
knew
he
stopped
at
the
print
shop
to
rest
his
horse
which
was
wringing
wet
with
sweat
though
the
day
was
piercing
cold
he
threw
the
saddle
blanket
over
the
horse
and
came
in
we
begged
him
to
go
and
find
out
whether
or
not
the
wagors
were
all
right
after
ida
mary
and
i
had
got
straightened
out
it
occurred
to
us
that
they
had
sent
in
their
order
for
coal
with
ours
like
us
they
might
be
imprisoned
in
their
shack
and
low
on
fuel
but
unlike
us
there
would
be
no
question
of
their
battling
their
way
across
the
prairie
to
shelter
sufferin
sinners
grumbled
sourdough
think
i
got
time
to
fool
around
with
homesteaders
when
a
bunch
of
critters
is
maybe
dead
or
starvin
to
death
godamighty
we
argued
and
insisted
telling
him
that
he
knew
better
how
to
break
a
trail
than
the
tenderfeet
around
here
that
his
horse
was
better
trained
for
it
this
country
war
made
for
no
humans
just
indians
and
rattlesnakes
and
cowhands
is
all
it
was
intended
for
i
agreed
with
him
i
was
ready
to
agree
with
anything
he
might
say
if
he
would
only
go
to
the
wagors
shack
at
last
after
we
had
exhausted
all
the
wiles
and
arts
of
persuasion
at
our
command
ida
mary
told
him
that
come
to
think
of
it
she
had
seen
a
bunch
of
cattle
drifting
in
the
direction
of
the
wagor
claim
he
started
out
saying
he
might
stop
in
if
he
happened
to
drift
by
and
it
come
handy
sourdough
found
the
wagors
covered
up
in
bed
they
had
been
in
bed
two
days
and
three
nights
the
fuel
had
given
out
as
we
had
feared
cow
chips
and
all
they
had
burned
hay
until
the
drifts
became
so
high
and
the
stack
so
deeply
covered
that
the
poor
old
man
could
no
longer
get
to
it
the
cow
and
the
blind
horse
had
barely
enough
feed
left
to
keep
alive
not
daring
to
burn
the
last
bit
of
hay
or
newspaper
which
would
not
have
warmed
the
house
anyhow
the
old
couple
had
gone
to
bed
piling
over
them
everything
that
could
conceivably
shut
out
that
penetrating
dead
cold
getting
up
just
long
enough
to
boil
coffee
fry
a
little
bacon
and
thaw
out
the
bread
they
dipped
up
snow
at
the
door
and
melted
it
for
water
the
bread
had
run
out
and
the
last
scrap
of
fuel
they
tore
down
the
kitchen
shelf
chopped
it
up
and
the
last
piece
of
it
had
gone
for
a
flame
to
make
the
morning
coffee
the
little
snugly
built
shack
was
freezing
cold
a
glass
jar
of
milk
in
the
kitchen
had
frozen
so
hard
that
it
broke
the
jar
when
sourdough
walked
in
and
learned
the
situation
he
bellowed
sufferin
sinners
and
tore
out
like
a
mad
steer
he
cut
into
the
haystack
cut
up
a
few
posts
from
the
corral
fence
and
made
a
fire
and
when
a
range
rider
makes
a
fire
it
burns
like
a
conflagration
he
fed
the
two
dumb
animals
meaning
the
cow
and
horse
he
explained
though
they
were
half
as
dumb
as
anyone
who
would
go
homesteading
while
ma
stirred
up
some
corn
cakes
and
made
coffee
for
them
all
milk
the
cow
what
the
hell
did
they
think
he
was
a
calf
sourdough
like
most
cowboys
had
never
milked
a
cow
the
only
milk
he
ever
used
came
out
of
a
can
he
reported
when
we
wondered
what
could
be
done
next
he
said
carelessly
godamighty
let
stay
in
bed
if
they
freeze
to
death
it
will
serve
right
for
comin
out
here
grumbling
ranting
on
he
slammed
the
door
and
strode
out
to
the
barn
saddled
bill
the
stronger
horse
of
the
brown
team
and
led
him
to
the
door
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
demanded
ride
this
plug
of
yourn
to
hunt
them
critters
you
never
saw
a
bunch
goin
that
way
he
accused
ida
mary
she
smiled
at
the
ruse
she
had
used
to
start
him
out
he
jumped
on
bill
leading
his
cow
pony
behind
a
range
rider
knows
how
to
conserve
a
horse
strength
and
followed
the
trail
he
had
broken
straight
back
toward
the
wagor
shack
now
we
knew
he
was
going
after
ma
and
pa
they
would
be
warm
and
nourished
with
strength
for
the
trip
and
good
old
bill
could
carry
them
both
a
few
days
later
when
we
asked
ma
about
the
harrowing
experience
she
laughed
and
said
oh
it
was
so
bad
pa
and
i
talked
over
our
whole
life
in
those
three
days
telling
each
other
about
our
young
days
pa
telling
me
about
some
girls
he
used
to
spark
that
i
never
woulda
heard
about
if
it
had
been
for
that
blizzard
i
told
him
about
my
first
husband
he
the
one
who
left
me
the
broach
we
did
get
pretty
cold
toward
the
last
i
burned
up
every
old
catalog
i
had
saved
i
always
told
pa
they
would
come
in
handy
what
afraid
we
would
freeze
to
death
well
we
woulda
gone
together
the
blizzard
was
over
but
the
snow
lay
deep
all
over
the
prairie
and
the
great
cold
lasted
so
that
few
of
the
settlers
ventured
outside
their
shacks
for
days
there
was
no
hauling
done
the
trails
that
had
been
worn
since
spring
were
buried
deep
and
the
drifts
were
treacherous
there
were
many
homesteaders
over
the
reservation
who
were
running
out
of
fuel
now
if
ever
was
a
time
for
cooperation
and
printed
a
list
of
those
who
could
spare
fuel
they
would
share
with
those
in
need
of
it
they
brought
what
they
could
to
the
settlement
and
pooled
it
chopping
up
all
the
poles
and
posts
they
could
find
into
stovewood
and
taking
home
small
loads
to
tide
them
over
with
the
fury
of
that
storm
one
of
the
hardest
blizzards
the
frontier
had
experienced
the
winter
spent
itself
under
the
soft
warm
breath
of
a
chinook
the
snow
disappeared
like
magic
melting
into
the
soil
preparing
it
for
the
onslaught
of
the
plow
illustration
xii
a
new
america
ida
mary
and
i
came
through
the
winter
stronger
than
we
had
ever
been
before
but
we
welcomed
the
spring
with
grateful
hearts
only
poets
can
describe
the
electric
sweet
quality
of
spring
but
only
the
young
as
we
were
young
that
year
receive
the
full
impact
of
its
beauty
the
deep
cloudless
blue
of
western
skies
the
vivid
colors
after
the
dead
white
of
winter
were
fresh
revelations
as
though
we
had
never
known
them
before
one
spring
day
i
was
making
up
the
paper
while
the
little
boy
watched
me
are
you
going
to
be
a
printer
when
you
grow
up
heine
nope
i
do
want
no
little
types
he
replied
i
like
traction
machines
better
they
go
my
pa
got
one
a
tractor
coming
on
the
strip
i
ran
to
tell
ida
mary
as
it
chugged
and
caterpillared
from
town
through
the
reservation
chris
christopherson
tractor
caused
almost
as
much
excitement
as
the
first
steamship
up
the
hudson
men
women
and
children
gathered
about
and
stared
at
the
new
machine
as
its
row
of
plows
cut
through
the
stubborn
sod
like
a
mighty
conqueror
he
was
plowing
a
hundred
acres
a
few
cattlemen
from
the
open
country
rode
into
the
strip
to
see
it
and
bowed
their
heads
to
this
evidence
of
the
coming
of
agriculture
old
ivar
eagleheart
and
others
of
the
indian
braves
looked
on
this
mystic
power
sealed
their
fate
it
was
in
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
save
territory
for
his
race
that
an
old
indian
chief
had
stood
indomitable
contending
with
the
white
fathers
wherever
you
find
a
sioux
grave
that
land
is
ours
in
this
plowing
up
of
the
hunting
grounds
no
one
thought
of
sioux
graves
the
mcclure
homesteaders
had
filed
on
their
claims
proved
up
and
gone
many
of
them
leaving
empty
shacks
here
on
the
strip
were
increasing
signs
of
permanency
many
brulé
settlers
went
back
home
and
disposed
of
whatever
property
they
had
in
order
to
make
permanent
improvements
on
their
claims
other
machinery
came
within
a
radius
of
three
miles
of
ammons
three
tractors
ran
all
day
all
night
one
could
see
their
bright
headlights
moving
and
hear
their
engines
over
the
dark
plain
turning
under
the
bluebells
and
anemones
as
they
went
and
the
tall
grass
where
buffalo
had
ranged
fragrant
scent
of
wild
flowers
blended
with
the
pungent
odor
of
earth
and
floated
across
the
plain
when
those
owning
tractors
got
through
breaking
for
themselves
they
turned
over
sod
for
other
settlers
in
every
direction
on
the
brulé
and
all
over
the
plains
which
had
been
settled
teams
went
up
and
down
making
a
black
and
green
checkerboard
of
the
prairie
ida
mary
and
i
had
chris
break
and
sow
sixty
acres
of
our
land
to
flax
it
cost
and
we
again
stretched
our
credit
to
the
breaking
point
to
borrow
the
money
try
out
fifteen
or
twenty
acres
first
not
we
if
we
had
a
good
crop
it
would
pay
for
the
land
the
winners
in
the
rosebud
drawing
were
swarming
onto
their
claims
moving
their
families
and
immigrant
goods
in
a
continuous
stream
towns
for
many
miles
around
were
deluged
with
trade
it
was
estimated
that
the
rosebud
alone
would
add
new
people
to
the
west
with
the
settlers
families
tradesmen
and
others
whom
the
rosebud
development
would
bring
a
few
groups
of
settlers
from
chicago
and
other
cities
came
with
a
fanfare
of
adventure
new
to
the
homestead
country
but
many
stolid
farmers
too
went
into
tripp
county
in
which
the
rosebud
lay
i
got
a
letter
from
the
chicago
reporter
saying
i
did
not
draw
a
lucky
number
but
i
came
in
on
the
second
series
to
take
the
place
of
those
who
dropped
out
am
out
on
my
land
and
feeling
better
it
was
sporting
of
you
to
offer
to
find
a
claim
for
me
things
are
moving
fast
on
the
rosebud
word
spread
that
homesteaders
were
flocking
farther
west
in
dakota
to
the
black
hills
and
on
to
the
vast
northwest
that
inexorable
tide
was
pressing
on
taking
up
the
land
transforming
the
prairie
forcing
it
to
yield
its
harvest
shaping
the
country
to
its
needs
creating
a
new
empire
we
peopled
and
stocked
the
west
by
rail
and
put
vast
millions
in
the
hands
of
the
railroads
wagon
caravans
moved
on
from
the
railroad
into
the
interior
many
going
as
far
as
fifty
sixty
a
hundred
miles
over
a
trailless
desert
homesteaders
who
had
no
money
and
nothing
to
haul
came
through
in
dilapidated
vehicles
and
lived
in
tents
until
they
got
jobs
and
earned
money
to
buy
lumber
a
few
came
in
automobiles
there
were
more
cars
seen
in
the
moving
caravans
now
it
was
not
only
settlers
the
railroads
carried
west
now
it
was
tools
and
machinery
and
the
vast
quantities
of
goods
needed
for
comfort
and
permanent
occupation
and
the
increasing
demand
for
these
materials
was
giving
extra
work
to
factories
and
businesses
in
the
east
on
the
brulé
we
watched
the
growth
of
other
sections
of
the
west
at
home
alone
one
evening
ida
mary
had
carried
her
supper
tray
outdoors
and
as
she
sat
there
a
rider
came
over
the
plains
she
could
barely
recognize
him
in
the
dusk
lone
star
she
exclaimed
as
he
stopped
beside
her
he
sat
silent
dejected
looking
over
the
broad
fields
he
had
brought
the
herd
north
to
summer
pasture
did
you
escape
the
pesky
homesteaders
by
going
south
she
laughed
no
he
said
soberly
they
all
over
not
near
as
thick
as
they
are
here
but
colorado
and
new
mexico
are
getting
all
cluttered
up
old
cattle
trails
broke
cai
drive
a
herd
straight
through
no
more
why
he
looked
at
her
as
though
some
great
calamity
had
befallen
i
bet
there
a
million
miles
o
wire
strung
between
here
and
texas
shore
got
the
old
brulé
tore
up
she
laughed
better
not
let
my
sister
hear
you
say
that
look
at
our
crop
coming
up
i
did
think
would
stick
it
out
this
winter
he
said
most
of
the
settlers
stayed
she
assured
him
looks
like
the
end
of
the
free
range
he
said
cattle
business
is
going
to
be
different
from
now
on
he
smiled
wanly
and
asked
for
his
mail
which
consisted
only
of
a
pile
of
copies
of
a
newspaper
he
took
them
and
rode
off
to
the
southeast
the
vague
description
he
had
given
us
as
to
where
he
belonged
but
he
had
brought
news
the
stream
of
immigration
was
flowing
in
to
the
south
and
west
of
us
into
country
which
was
talked
of
as
more
arid
and
more
barren
than
this
tall
grass
country
the
told
the
story
the
united
states
had
entered
an
era
of
western
development
when
the
homesteaders
not
only
settled
the
land
but
moved
together
acted
together
to
subdue
the
land
it
was
an
untried
hazardous
venture
on
which
they
staked
everything
they
had
but
that
is
the
way
empires
are
built
and
this
vast
frontier
was
conquered
in
the
first
two
decades
of
the
twentieth
century
a
victory
whose
significance
has
been
almost
totally
ignored
by
historical
studies
of
the
country
which
view
the
last
frontier
as
having
vanished
a
generation
or
more
before
iron
trails
pushed
through
new
regions
trails
crossing
the
network
of
new
civilization
broadened
into
highways
and
wagon
tracks
cut
their
way
where
no
trails
ever
led
before
new
towns
were
being
built
industry
and
commerce
were
coming
in
on
the
tidal
wave
a
new
america
no
laws
no
enforced
projects
or
programs
of
a
federal
administration
could
possibly
achieve
the
great
solid
expansion
which
this
voluntary
land
movement
by
the
masses
brought
about
naturally
it
takes
almost
every
commodity
to
develop
a
vast
dominion
that
has
lain
empty
since
genesis
it
took
steel
for
railroads
fences
and
plowshares
it
took
lumber
and
labor
labor
no
end
in
towns
and
out
on
the
land
it
took
farm
machinery
horses
harness
stoves
oil
food
and
clothing
to
build
this
new
world
i
was
delighted
when
one
day
there
came
a
letter
from
halbert
donovan
the
new
york
broker
it
contained
great
news
for
and
there
was
a
little
personal
touch
that
was
gratifying
we
are
beginning
to
feel
the
effect
of
a
business
expansion
back
here
he
wrote
which
the
western
land
development
seems
to
be
bringing
about
if
it
continues
with
all
the
public
domain
that
is
there
it
is
bound
to
create
an
enormous
demand
in
industry
and
commerce
and
i
emphasize
the
statement
i
made
to
you
that
it
is
a
gigantic
project
which
a
government
alone
could
finance
and
which
requires
the
work
of
powerful
industrial
corporations
but
looking
over
that
desolate
prairie
one
wonders
how
it
can
be
done
or
if
it
is
just
a
splurge
of
proving
up
and
deserting
however
it
is
surprising
what
these
homesteaders
are
doing
and
it
is
ironic
that
a
little
poetic
dreamer
should
have
foreseen
the
trend
which
things
are
taking
and
i
feel
you
deserve
this
acknowledgment
how
in
the
name
of
god
have
you
and
your
sister
stuck
it
out
the
reason
that
halbert
donovan
was
interested
in
the
progress
of
this
area
i
learned
was
that
his
company
had
mining
investments
in
the
black
hills
and
it
was
investigating
a
proposed
railroad
extension
through
the
section
the
expansion
which
was
beginning
to
be
felt
across
the
continent
grew
for
five
years
or
more
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
world
war
and
then
took
another
spurt
after
the
war
it
was
not
merely
a
boom
inflation
to
burst
like
a
bubble
it
grew
only
as
more
territory
was
settled
and
greater
areas
of
land
were
put
under
cultivation
do
you
know
what
we
need
out
here
most
of
all
i
said
to
chris
christopherson
one
day
having
in
mind
a
settlers
bank
yah
yah
chris
broke
in
his
ruddy
features
beaming
in
anticipation
a
blacksmith
shop
more
as
all
else
we
need
that
miles
we
bane
goin
to
sharpen
a
plowshare
or
shod
a
horse
yet
trade
business
industry
yes
of
course
but
first
the
plow
must
pave
the
way
during
those
years
money
flowed
from
the
farm
lands
rather
than
to
them
the
revenue
from
the
homestead
lands
was
bringing
millions
into
the
treasury
that
spring
the
newspaper
office
became
a
clearing
house
for
homestead
lands
people
wanting
either
to
buy
or
sell
relinquishments
came
there
for
information
all
kinds
of
notices
to
be
filed
with
the
department
of
the
interior
were
made
out
by
the
office
which
began
to
keep
legal
forms
in
stock
gradually
i
found
myself
becoming
an
interpreter
of
the
federal
land
laws
and
settlers
came
many
miles
for
advice
and
information
the
laws
governing
homesteading
were
technical
with
many
provisions
which
gave
rise
to
controversy
i
discovered
that
many
of
the
employees
in
the
department
knew
nothing
of
the
project
except
the
letter
of
the
law
through
my
work
in
handling
proofs
i
was
familiar
with
the
technicalities
from
actual
experience
i
had
learned
the
broader
fundamental
principles
as
they
could
be
applied
to
general
usage
i
became
a
sort
of
mediator
between
the
homesteader
and
the
united
states
land
office
it
was
a
unique
job
for
a
young
woman
and
brought
my
work
to
the
attention
of
officials
in
washington
and
several
congressional
public
land
committees
slowly
i
was
becoming
identified
with
the
land
movement
itself
and
i
had
learned
not
to
be
overawed
by
the
fact
that
some
of
the
government
who
came
out
to
the
strip
did
not
agree
with
my
opinions
i
had
clashed
already
with
several
of
them
who
had
been
sent
out
to
check
up
on
controversies
in
which
the
homesteaders
rights
were
disputed
they
knew
the
technicalities
better
perhaps
than
i
did
but
in
regard
to
conditions
on
the
frontier
they
were
rank
amateurs
and
i
knew
it
land
on
the
brulé
was
held
at
a
premium
and
landseekers
were
bidding
high
for
relinquishments
so
attractive
were
the
offers
that
a
few
settlers
who
were
hard
pressed
for
money
sold
their
rights
of
title
to
the
land
and
passed
it
on
to
others
who
would
the
claims
several
early
sold
their
deeded
quarters
raw
unimproved
miles
from
a
railroad
for
to
cash
money
real
estate
dealers
of
presho
pierre
and
other
small
towns
looked
to
the
brulé
as
a
plum
trying
to
list
relinquishments
there
for
their
customers
but
i
got
the
bulk
of
the
business
one
of
the
handy
men
around
the
place
sawed
boards
and
made
an
extra
table
with
rows
of
pigeonholes
on
it
and
we
installed
this
in
the
back
end
of
the
print
shop
for
the
heavy
business
most
of
our
work
on
land
affairs
was
done
free
in
connection
with
the
legal
work
of
the
newspaper
then
buyers
or
sellers
of
relinquishments
began
paying
us
a
commission
and
one
day
ida
mary
sold
a
claim
for
spot
cash
and
got
for
making
the
deal
selling
claims
she
said
was
as
easy
as
selling
tobacco
to
the
indians
the
difficulty
lay
in
finding
claims
for
sale
the
went
to
sedgwick
at
the
bank
on
an
overdue
note
he
had
moved
into
a
bank
building
now
set
on
a
solid
foundation
instead
of
the
rolling
sheep
wagon
whose
only
operating
expense
was
the
pistols
that
entire
section
of
the
frontier
was
making
ready
for
the
incoming
torrent
of
the
rosebud
settlers
to
take
possession
of
their
claims
droves
of
them
landed
at
presho
early
reawakening
the
town
and
the
plains
with
a
new
invasion
thousands
who
had
not
won
a
claim
followed
in
their
wake
and
everyone
when
he
had
crossed
the
missouri
river
heard
about
the
brulé
the
government
sent
out
notice
for
the
appointment
of
a
regular
mail
carrier
for
the
ammons
post
office
dave
dykstra
had
resigned
to
farm
his
land
and
sam
frye
a
young
homesteader
with
a
family
was
appointed
we
began
to
need
more
printing
equipment
to
carry
on
the
increased
newspaper
business
and
to
take
care
of
the
flood
of
proofs
which
would
come
in
that
summer
there
was
interest
and
a
payment
on
the
press
coming
due
so
there
was
a
day
when
ida
mary
said
we
were
going
to
go
under
unless
we
could
do
some
high
financing
within
thirty
days
oh
we
get
through
somehow
i
assured
her
it
like
a
poker
game
you
never
know
what
kind
of
hand
you
will
hold
in
the
next
deal
planning
ahead
did
help
much
because
something
unexpected
usually
happened
but
no
matter
what
hard
luck
a
homesteader
had
or
how
much
he
had
paid
the
government
unless
he
could
meet
the
payments
and
all
other
requirements
fully
he
lost
the
land
and
all
he
had
put
into
it
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
our
claim
so
i
concentrated
on
my
land
office
business
as
usual
something
happened
i
was
sitting
in
the
private
office
of
the
united
states
land
commissioner
in
presho
when
a
man
walked
into
the
front
office
and
put
a
contest
on
a
piece
of
land
i
heard
the
numbers
repeated
through
the
thin
partition
and
i
knew
exactly
where
the
land
lay
it
was
a
south
of
us
on
the
reservation
which
belonged
to
a
young
man
who
had
to
abandon
it
because
he
was
ill
and
penniless
he
had
got
a
leave
of
absence
which
had
run
out
and
he
had
no
funds
to
carry
on
and
prove
up
the
claim
yet
he
had
put
into
the
gamble
several
hundred
dollars
and
spent
almost
a
year
time
on
it
now
he
was
to
lose
it
to
the
man
who
had
contested
it
nothing
could
be
done
to
save
the
land
for
the
man
who
had
gone
home
he
had
forfeited
it
i
started
from
my
chair
the
contest
must
be
filed
in
pierre
if
i
could
get
one
in
first
i
could
help
out
the
man
whose
illness
had
deprived
him
of
his
land
and
help
out
the
ailing
ammons
finances
but
it
would
be
a
race
through
the
outer
office
i
rushed
while
the
land
agent
called
after
me
just
a
minute
edith
i
be
back
i
told
him
breathlessly
i
be
back
i
just
thought
of
something
i
made
the
trip
from
presho
to
ammons
in
record
time
raced
into
the
post
office
and
filled
out
a
legal
form
with
the
numbers
i
had
heard
through
the
thin
wall
but
i
needed
someone
not
already
holding
a
claim
to
sign
it
and
there
was
a
soul
at
the
settlement
who
would
do
it
was
getting
dark
when
ida
mary
finally
announced
jubilantly
that
someone
was
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
rangeland
it
was
coyote
cal
thus
called
because
he
ran
from
the
gals
like
a
skeered
coyote
talking
excitedly
i
dragged
him
into
the
print
shop
to
sign
the
paper
i
do
want
any
doggone
homestead
pushed
off
onto
me
he
protested
i
thrust
the
paper
into
his
hands
it
wo
obligate
you
in
any
way
i
explained
all
right
he
agreed
he
enjoyed
playing
jokes
and
this
one
amused
him
but
you
sure
i
wo
get
no
homestead
coyote
poised
the
pen
stiffly
in
his
hand
let
see
he
murmured
in
embarrassment
it
been
so
long
since
i
signed
my
name
danged
if
i
can
recollect
the
pen
stuck
in
his
awkward
fingers
as
he
swung
it
about
like
a
lariat
finally
he
wrote
laboriously
calvin
aloysius
bancroft
with
the
signed
paper
in
my
hands
i
saddled
lakota
and
streaked
off
for
the
trip
to
pierre
late
that
night
a
tired
horse
and
its
rider
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
little
hotel
in
pierre
i
routed
a
station
agent
out
of
bed
and
sent
a
telegram
to
the
young
man
who
had
left
his
claim
next
morning
when
the
land
office
at
pierre
opened
its
door
the
clerks
found
me
backed
up
against
it
with
a
paper
in
my
outstretched
hand
half
an
hour
later
when
the
morning
mail
was
opened
at
the
land
office
there
was
a
contest
in
it
filed
at
presho
but
i
had
slapped
a
contest
on
the
same
first
a
contest
filed
by
one
calvin
aloysius
bancroft
a
legal
applicant
for
the
claim
in
the
mail
i
received
a
signed
relinquishment
for
the
land
from
the
young
man
withdrew
the
contest
and
sold
the
relinquishment
which
is
the
filer
claim
to
the
land
for
i
had
made
enough
on
the
deal
to
meet
our
own
emergencies
and
had
saved
for
the
young
man
who
needed
it
badly
and
was
still
safe
all
around
us
the
land
was
being
harnessed
a
desert
being
conquered
with
plowshares
as
swords
scotty
phillips
stopped
in
at
the
print
shop
on
his
way
from
pierre
where
he
lived
to
his
ranch
the
stockmen
have
been
asleep
he
said
they
ridiculed
the
idea
that
the
range
could
ever
be
farmed
and
now
they
are
homesteading
trying
to
get
hold
of
land
as
fast
as
they
can
i
have
indian
lands
leased
so
i
am
all
right
as
a
squaw
man
he
naturally
owned
quite
a
bit
of
land
a
piece
for
each
child
and
he
had
three
children
panicky
some
of
the
stockmen
filed
on
land
but
a
homestead
for
them
was
just
big
enough
for
the
ranch
buildings
and
corrals
it
still
did
not
allow
for
the
essential
thing
large
range
for
the
cattle
they
began
to
buy
from
homesteaders
and
lease
lands
around
them
for
years
the
livestockman
of
the
west
had
been
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
and
the
end
of
his
reign
was
in
sight
like
all
classes
of
people
who
have
failed
to
keep
step
with
the
march
of
progress
he
would
have
to
follow
the
herd
a
strong
spirit
of
cooperation
and
harmony
had
developed
among
the
army
of
the
brulé
they
worked
together
like
clockwork
there
was
little
grumbling
or
just
how
much
had
done
in
creating
this
invaluable
asset
to
a
new
country
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
a
factor
we
were
a
people
dependent
upon
one
another
ours
was
a
land
without
established
social
law
or
custom
it
was
impossible
to
regulate
one
life
or
habits
by
any
set
rule
and
there
was
no
time
or
energy
for
idle
gossip
or
criticism
each
one
had
all
he
could
do
to
manage
his
own
business
i
had
been
working
at
high
pressure
and
as
summer
came
on
again
i
went
back
to
louis
for
a
few
weeks
of
rest
back
down
the
mississippi
on
the
old
bald
eagle
to
find
my
father
waiting
at
the
dock
i
had
half
expected
to
find
the
family
awaiting
roaring
stories
of
the
west
instead
they
listened
eagerly
and
asked
apt
questions
about
soil
and
costs
and
the
future
things
were
going
well
for
them
perhaps
for
my
father
and
the
two
small
boys
the
future
would
point
west
i
was
surprised
to
find
the
general
interest
that
people
in
louis
were
taking
in
the
west
and
in
homesteading
its
importance
something
even
of
its
significance
was
coming
to
be
realized
they
asked
serious
questions
and
demanded
more
and
more
information
about
the
land
business
men
talked
about
new
opportunities
there
bring
lots
of
new
business
this
land
movement
i
heard
on
many
sides
after
those
long
months
of
struggle
for
the
bare
necessities
i
was
greatly
struck
by
lavish
spending
it
seemed
startling
to
one
from
pioneer
country
where
did
the
money
come
from
i
wondered
that
city
folk
were
spending
like
water
i
had
come
to
think
of
wealth
as
coming
from
the
land
here
people
talked
of
capital
stocks
and
bonds
occasionally
of
trade
expansion
surely
this
western
development
i
protested
was
responsible
in
part
for
trade
expansion
ida
mary
had
said
i
ran
to
land
as
a
missourian
did
to
mules
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
consider
it
as
an
economic
issue
i
was
restless
during
my
stay
in
louis
the
city
seemed
to
have
changed
or
perhaps
i
had
changed
and
i
was
glad
to
get
back
home
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
called
the
west
home
unbelievably
unlike
my
first
sight
of
the
desolate
region
i
found
it
a
thriving
land
of
farms
and
plowed
fields
of
growing
crops
and
bustling
communities
whose
growth
had
already
begun
to
affect
the
east
bringing
increased
business
and
prosperity
whose
rapid
development
and
influence
people
were
only
slowly
beginning
to
comprehend
all
this
had
been
achieved
in
less
than
two
years
without
federal
aid
with
little
money
achieved
by
hard
labor
cooperation
and
unquenchable
hope
illustration
xiii
the
thirsty
land
you
better
do
a
little
exhortin
ma
told
me
on
my
return
to
the
claim
and
if
you
get
any
collections
turn
some
of
them
in
for
the
good
of
the
store
is
business
good
business
is
pouring
in
it
money
i
talking
about
there
wo
be
any
money
until
the
crops
are
threshed
which
will
be
about
christmas
time
out
here
now
in
blue
springs
i
did
hear
the
rest
of
it
in
the
city
i
had
been
struck
by
the
lavish
spending
of
money
money
which
was
at
such
a
premium
out
here
there
was
something
shockingly
disproportionate
in
the
capacity
to
spend
by
city
people
and
those
on
farms
at
least
the
crops
look
good
but
ida
mary
pointed
out
they
need
rain
and
the
dams
are
beginning
to
get
low
what
about
the
wells
the
settlers
are
digging
for
water
supply
they
get
nothing
but
dry
holes
she
told
me
some
of
the
settlers
brought
in
but
they
did
find
water
they
do
know
what
to
do
all
other
issues
faded
into
the
background
before
the
urgency
of
the
water
problem
i
packed
my
city
clothes
deep
down
in
the
trunk
never
to
be
worn
again
and
went
to
work
a
casual
glance
revealed
no
sign
of
the
emergency
we
were
facing
the
lower
brulé
was
a
broad
expanse
of
green
grass
and
grain
rippling
gently
in
the
breeze
like
water
on
a
quiet
sea
sufficient
moisture
from
the
snow
and
early
rain
had
been
retained
in
the
subsoil
for
vegetation
but
we
needed
water
with
the
hot
weather
the
dams
were
going
dry
there
had
been
increased
demands
for
water
this
summer
and
there
had
not
been
the
late
torrential
rains
to
fill
the
dams
as
there
had
been
the
year
before
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
asked
the
other
settlers
haul
water
until
we
can
get
wells
we
have
to
dig
deeper
perhaps
we
have
just
not
struck
the
water
veins
after
this
we
will
follow
the
draws
again
but
haul
it
from
where
there
was
no
supply
in
the
country
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
the
region
drills
would
cost
money
and
few
settlers
had
any
money
left
there
was
no
sign
of
rain
and
an
oppression
weighed
upon
everyone
as
of
impending
evil
the
fear
of
a
water
famine
first
we
had
come
to
understand
the
primitive
worship
of
fire
now
we
began
to
know
that
water
is
as
vital
to
life
as
air
itself
it
takes
experience
to
bring
home
the
meaning
of
familiar
words
in
the
meantime
the
tall
waving
crops
brought
land
agents
with
their
buyers
at
the
first
sign
of
water
shortage
more
claims
were
offered
for
sale
and
by
that
time
there
were
a
few
deeded
tracts
put
on
the
market
loan
agents
camped
at
the
settlement
following
up
settlers
ready
to
prove
up
one
could
borrow
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
on
a
homestead
now
the
money
coming
through
our
hands
on
relinquishments
options
government
payments
was
mainly
in
bulk
and
growing
beyond
the
coffee
cans
and
old
shoes
where
we
secreted
money
awaiting
deposit
at
the
bank
we
did
need
a
bank
on
the
brulé
during
the
long
hot
summer
weeks
when
it
did
not
grow
dark
on
the
open
plain
until
far
into
the
night
a
great
deal
of
traveling
was
done
at
night
it
was
easier
for
man
and
horse
on
moonlight
nights
that
white
light
shining
through
the
thin
atmosphere
made
the
prairie
as
light
as
day
but
ghostly
moonlight
softened
the
contours
of
the
plains
and
robbed
them
of
their
color
sounds
traveled
great
distances
seeming
to
come
from
space
the
howling
of
coyotes
down
the
draw
the
shrill
busy
sound
of
insects
in
the
long
grass
the
stamping
of
the
horses
in
the
barn
accentuated
the
stillness
they
did
not
break
it
even
the
prairie
wind
came
softly
sweet
with
the
scent
of
hay
not
lifting
its
voice
on
those
hushed
nights
with
the
stillness
invading
one
flesh
and
bones
and
the
prairie
washed
by
moonlight
stretching
out
beyond
one
imagination
i
wondered
that
i
had
ever
feared
space
and
quiet
but
out
of
the
silence
would
come
the
rhythmic
thud
of
a
horse
feet
and
a
loud
hail
the
ammons
settlement
was
a
institution
with
a
loud
knock
on
the
door
would
come
the
identification
alberts
or
kimball
or
pinchot
real
estate
agents
i
got
a
man
here
who
wants
to
pay
a
deposit
on
quarter
of
section
we
on
our
way
to
the
land
office
want
to
be
there
when
it
opens
one
of
us
would
light
the
lamp
make
out
the
papers
take
the
money
and
stumble
back
to
bed
a
sign
closed
or
never
closed
would
have
been
equally
ineffective
in
stopping
the
night
movement
on
the
strip
homesteaders
living
miles
away
came
after
the
long
day
work
to
put
in
their
notices
they
must
be
in
the
paper
the
following
day
to
go
through
the
five
weeks
publication
before
the
date
set
at
the
land
office
during
those
scorching
weeks
their
days
were
taken
up
by
hauling
water
and
caring
for
things
at
home
with
those
urgent
night
calls
we
did
not
stick
a
gun
out
as
had
the
presho
banker
we
were
not
greatly
perturbed
about
the
possibility
of
anyone
robbing
us
a
burglar
who
could
find
the
money
would
accomplish
more
than
we
could
do
half
the
time
so
outlandish
had
the
hiding
places
become
imbert
insisted
that
we
keep
a
loaded
gun
or
two
on
the
place
but
we
knew
nothing
about
handling
guns
and
were
more
afraid
of
them
than
of
being
molested
ada
put
up
her
folding
cot
at
night
in
the
kitchen
and
one
day
she
brought
a
rawhide
whip
from
home
and
laid
it
on
the
scantling
that
girded
the
walls
the
she
called
it
you
do
need
a
gun
she
said
in
her
slow
calm
voice
just
give
me
a
rawhide
with
that
sure
strong
arm
of
hers
and
the
keen
whip
one
would
never
enter
without
shooting
first
there
were
a
few
nights
when
we
woke
to
find
ada
standing
still
as
a
statue
in
her
long
white
cotton
nightgown
braids
hanging
down
her
back
rawhide
in
her
right
hand
only
to
find
whoever
had
prowled
around
had
driven
on
or
that
it
was
tim
carter
the
lawyer
coming
home
from
town
intoxicated
talking
and
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
during
that
period
the
days
were
usually
quiet
and
we
worked
in
shifts
as
much
as
our
many
duties
permitted
come
on
girls
ma
would
call
this
ice
tea
is
goin
to
be
hot
if
you
do
come
and
drink
it
now
this
is
made
from
dam

fred
hauled
it
over
from
the
crick
fred
farraday
did
things
like
that
without
mentioning
them
it
set
in
the
cave
all
day
now
the
ladies
aid
back
in
blue
springs
sticks
a
piece
of
lemon
on
the
glass
to
squeeze
in
just
to
get
your
fingers
all
stuck
up
with

never
was
one

an
extra
glass

the
one
thing
that
shook
his
calmness
you
do
expect
like
heine
to
drink
tea
protested
van
leshout
a
sly
grin
on
heine
face
which
the
artist
quickly
caught
on
paper
pa
drinks
it
from
ma
with
that
snapping
of
the
jaw
which
in
ma
expressed
emphasis
poor
old
pa
was
the
shining
example
of
masculinity
in
her
eyes
like
a
sudden
breath
the
hot
winds
came
the
dams
were
getting
dangerously
low
the
water
was
dirty
and
and
thick
and
ada
folks
lost
a
horse
and
a
cow
alkalied
the
drier
it
became
the
whiter
the
ground
on
the
alkali
spots
we
had
no
alkali
on
the
great
grassy
brulé
but
there
were
strips
outside
the
reservation
thick
with
it
and
the
water
in
those
sections
contained
enough
of
it
to
turn
one
stomach
into
stone
carrying
the
mail
from
the
stage
i
saw
along
the
trail
horses
and
cattle
leaning
against
the
fences
or
lying
down
fairly
eaten
up
with
it
mere
skin
and
bones
mane
and
tail
all
fallen
out
hoofs
dropped
off
a
number
of
settlers
had
not
a
horse
left
that
could
put
his
foot
to
the
ground
to
travel
every
day
there
were
a
few
more
horses
and
cows
lying
dead
over
the
pastures
gradually
however
most
of
the
afflicted
stock
picked
up
got
new
hoofs
new
manes
and
tails
the
livestock
even
the
dogs
and
the
wild
animals
on
the
plains
drank
from
little
holes
of
reservoirs
at
the
foot
of
the
slopes
until
the
water
became
so
hot
and
that
they
turned
away
from
it
but
the
settlers
skimmed
back
the
thick
green
scum
dipped
up
the
water
let
it
settle
and
used
it
the
dam
water
must
be
boiled
we
warned
each
other
yet
we
did
not
always
wait
for
a
drink
of
water
until
it
had
been
boiled
and
cooled
late
that
summer
when
the
drying
winds
parched
the
country
the
dams
became
the
only
green
spots
left
on
the
yellow
plains
but
the
cry
for
rain
was
no
longer
for
the
fields
it
was
for
the
people
themselves
a
few
narrow
crooked
creeks
cut
their
way
through
the
great
tableland
of
prairie
but
they
were
as
problematic
as
the
arkansas
traveler
roof
in
that
they
overflowed
in
the
rainy
season
when
we
did
not
need
water
and
were
dry
as
a
bone
when
we
did
need
it
the
creeks
were
dry
now
except
the
water
holes
in
the
creek
beds
and
a
few
seep
wells
which
homesteaders
living
near
the
creeks
had
dug
and
into
which
water
from
the
creeks
had
seeped
time
came
for
a
few
and
the
ones
who
had
not
come
to
farm
left
as
soon
as
they
proved
up
at
least
until
the
following
year
and
the
situation
was
so
serious
we
were
glad
to
have
them
go
the
fewer
there
were
of
us
the
less
water
we
would
need
to
add
to
the
troubles
of
the
homesteaders
there
were
increased
activities
by
claim
jumpers
almost
equal
to
the
old
gangs
were
the
land
rustlers
who
covered
up
land
as
the
cattle
thieves
did
brands
making
mavericks
out
of
branded
stock
technicalities
false
filings
or
open
crookedness
were
used
to
hold
rich
valleys
and
creeks
and
water
holes
open
or
to
block
the
settler
proof
title
because
the
problem
was
a
federal
one
the
courts
and
men
like
judge
bartine
were
powerless
to
act
in
the
matter
the
west
needed
fearless
representation
in
washington
if
john
bartine
were
elected
westerners
said
he
would
fight
the
land
graft
but
there
must
be
a
strong
campaign
against
it
on
the
ground
he
emphasized
the
frontier
newspapers
can
become
the
most
powerful
agency
in
abolishing
this
evil
could
help
i
asked
its
influence
not
only
would
be
effective
he
assured
me
but
it
would
set
a
precedent
and
give
courage
to
other
little
proof
sheets
so
took
up
the
issue
using
what
influence
it
had
to
bring
a
halt
to
the
activities
of
the
claim
jumpers
and
the
homesteaders
continued
their
battle
for
the
thirsty
land
whisky
barrels
and
milk
cans
were
the
artillery
most
essential
to
keep
this
valiant
army
from
going
down
in
defeat
they
were
as
scarce
as
hen
teeth
and
soared
sky
high
in
price
so
great
was
the
demand
on
the
frontier
barrel
and
can
manufacturers
must
have
made
fortunes
during
the
years
of
in
the
homestead
country
the
size
of
a
man
herd
and
thus
his
rank
as
a
farmer
was
judged
by
the
number
of
barrels
and
cans
surrounding
his
shack
or
barn
ida
mary
bought
a
barrel
and
several
new
milk
cans
you
can
not
use
the
barrel
for
water
joe
said
it
is
yet
wet
with
he
drained
a
pint
or
more
of
whisky
from
it
it
would
have
to
be
burned
out
no
one
wanted
these
days
across
the
hot
stretches
from
every
direction
there
moved
processions
of
livestock
being
driven
to
water
boards
nailed
across
two
runners
with
barrels
bobbing
up
and
down
on
them
buggies
wagons
all
loaded
with
cans
and
barrels
ida
mary
and
i
led
our
livestock
to
a
water
hole
three
miles
away
filling
water
cans
for
ourselves
the
ammons
caravan
moving
across
the
hot
dry
plain
was
a
sorry
spectacle
with
ida
in
the
vanguard
astride
old
pinto
her
hair
twisted
up
under
a
big
straw
hat
lakota
insisted
upon
jumping
the
creek
bed
and
we
were
not
trained
to
riding
to
hounds
in
the
flank
the
brown
team
and
lakota
the
menagerie
following
behind
coming
up
from
the
rear
i
sat
in
the
shay
behind
crazy
weed
the
blind
and
locoed
mare
with
the
water
cans
rattling
in
the
back
end
of
the
buggy
i
too
wore
an
old
straw
hat
big
as
a
sombrero
pushed
back
on
my
head
to
protect
my
sunburnt
neck
and
an
old
rag
of
a
dress
hanging
loose
on
my
small
body
which
was
becoming
thinner
the
sun
blazed
down
on
the
shadeless
prairie
and
the
very
air
smelled
of
heat
the
grain
was
shriveled
and
burnt
and
for
shelter
from
that
vast
furnace
a
shack
with
a
low
roof
as
we
reached
the
creek
crazy
weed
smelling
water
leaped
to
the
creek
bed
breaking
the
tugs
as
she
went
leaving
the
horseless
buggy
the
empty
cans
and
me
high
and
dry
on
the
bank
we
patched
up
the
tugs
fastened
them
to
the
singletree
with
hairpins
hitched
up
pinto
drove
down
to
the
water
hole
and
filled
our
cans
when
we
got
back
to
the
settlement
we
saw
lone
star
on
black
indian
waiting
for
us
he
dismounted
threw
the
reins
to
the
ground
and
carried
the
water
cans
into
the
cool
cave
do
know
what
we
goin
to
do
with
the
range
stock
he
said
anxiously
with
the
grass
dried
up
and
the
creeks
and
water
holes
on
the
range
goin
dry
lone
star
i
said
do
you
think
it
going
to
rain
soon
yesterday
i
had
asked
porcupine
bear
and
he
had
shaken
his
head
and
held
up
one
finger
after
another
counting
off
the
moons
before
rain
would
come
what
will
become
of
the
settlers
asked
ida
mary
the
quicker
these
homesteadin
herds
vacate
lone
star
answered
in
that
slow
drawl
of
his
the
better
for
everybody
the
hot
winds
have
come
too
early
goin
to
burn
the
pastures
looks
like
hard
to
find
water
now
for
the
cattle
he
handed
us
two
flasks
of
cold
water
brought
from
the
river
filled
while
the
water
was
cold
early
this
morning
cold
clear
water
we
drank
great
long
draughts
of
it
washed
ourselves
clean
and
fresh
in
a
basin
of
water
one
day
tim
carter
came
by
sober
the
damn
homestead
is
too
dry
for
a
man
to
drink
water
say
nothing
of
whisky
he
stormed
i
going
to
have
water
if
it
takes
my
last
dollar
he
brought
in
a
drill
for
several
days
neighbors
helped
with
the
drilling
others
flocked
around
with
strained
anxiety
waiting
waiting
for
that
drill
to
strike
water
then
one
scorching
afternoon
the
drillers
gave
a
whoop
as
they
brought
up
the
drill
oil
oil
there
oil
on
this
drill
damned
if
we
struck
oil
tim
carter
straight
portly
figure
drooped
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
aghast
at
the
evidence
before
him
oil
he
shouted
who
in
hell
wants
oil
nobody
but
rockefeller
it
water
we
want
pack
up
your
rig
boys
he
said
in
a
tone
of
defeat
as
though
made
a
final
plea
in
court
and
lost
the
case
a
discouraged
disheartened
group
they
turned
away
thirst
became
an
obsession
with
us
all
men
and
animals
alike
cattle
breaking
out
of
pastures
went
bawling
over
the
plains
horses
went
running
wildly
in
search
of
water
people
were
famished
for
a
cold
drink
i
do
believe
we
ought
to
drink
that
water
i
heard
ida
mary
tell
ma
wagor
as
she
stood
dipper
in
hand
looking
dubiously
into
the
bucket
oh
never
mind
about
the
germs
ma
said
just
pick
out
them
you
see
and
them
you
ca
see
ought
hurt
anybody
you
ca
be
persnickety
these
days
with
all
that
we
could
see
in
the
water
it
did
seem
as
though
the
invisible
ones
could
do
much
harm
with
the
perverseness
of
nature
the
less
water
one
has
the
thirstier
one
becomes
when
it
is
on
tap
one
does
think
of
it
but
down
to
the
last
our
thirst
was
unquenchable
the
store
supply
of
salmon
and
dried
beef
went
begging
while
it
kept
a
team
busy
hauling
canned
tomatoes
sauerkraut
vinegar
people
could
not
afford
lemons
so
vinegar
and
soda
were
used
to
make
a
refreshing
drink
homesteaders
reached
the
point
where
the
whole
family
washed
in
the
same
quart
of
water
a
little
more
soap
and
elbow
grease
the
women
said
was
the
secret
most
of
the
water
used
for
household
purposes
did
double
or
triple
duty
the
water
drained
from
potatoes
was
next
used
to
wash
face
or
hands
or
dishes
then
it
went
into
the
scrub
bucket
potato
water
kept
one
hands
and
face
soft
we
boasted
it
was
as
effective
as
face
cream
but
i
was
not
a
saver
by
nature
could
the
time
and
scheming
of
those
pioneer
women
to
save
water
have
been
utilized
in
some
water
project
it
would
have
watered
the
whole
frontier
but
gradually
we
were
becoming
listless
shiftless
we
were
in
a
stage
of
endurance
in
which
there
was
no
point
in
forging
ahead
we
merely
sat
and
waited
for
rain
or
wells
or
whatever
might
come
and
always
when
we
were
down
to
the
last
drop
someone
would
bring
us
water
i
never
knew
it
to
fail
one
such
time
we
looked
up
to
see
huey
dunn
coming
he
had
made
the
long
trip
just
to
bring
us
water
two
whole
barrels
of
it
although
we
had
not
seen
him
since
he
moved
us
to
the
reservation
it
was
so
hot
he
waited
until
evening
to
go
back
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
return
it
was
too
hot
to
work
but
when
had
huey
ever
been
in
a
hurry
we
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
shack
talking
he
had
dug
a
well
and
his
method
of
fall
plowing
fallowing
he
called
it
had
proved
successful
starting
home
toward
evening
he
called
back
if
you
girls
take
a
notion
to
leave
you
need
send
for
me
to
move
you
not
until
you
get
your
deed
anyhow
i
only
saw
him
once
after
that
ida
mary
never
again
ida
mary
was
seeing
a
lot
of
a
young
easterner
that
summer
an
attractive
cultured
boy
who
had
taken
a
claim
because
he
had
won
it
in
a
lottery
and
it
was
an
adventure
imbert
miller
had
gone
into
the
land
business
he
was
well
fitted
for
the
work
with
his
honest
open
manner
which
inspired
confidence
in
landseekers
and
his
knowledge
of
the
west
one
day
i
looked
up
from
my
work
with
a
belated
thought
imbert
has
been
here
for
some
time
what
the
matter
he
is
to
stay
away
until
i
send
him
word
i
got
to
be
sure
when
there
was
any
time
for
those
days
i
conjured
up
pictures
of
snow
banks
and
fountains
and
blessed
cooling
rain
and
long
icy
drinks
of
water
the
water
had
alkali
in
it
and
tasted
soapy
in
cooking
but
it
was
water
and
we
drank
it
gratefully
the
old
man
from
the
oklahoma
run
came
over
stooped
and
stiff
he
leaned
on
his
cane
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
settlers
who
had
met
to
discuss
the
drought
and
the
water
problem
now
down
in
oklahomy
he
began
it
was
hotter
than
brimstone
and
the
sooners
did
draw
ice
water
from
faucets
when
they
settled
there
sooners
we
took
it
were
those
who
got
on
the
land
sooner
than
the
others
water
was
imported
in
barrels
buying
water
was
like
buying
champagne
and
worse
to
drink
than
cawn
liquor
what
did
they
do
well
suh
he
went
on
the
long
mustache
twitching
one
of
the
fellahs
down
there
was
a
water
witch
he
pointed
out
where
the
water
could
be
got
divining
rods
that
the
solution
for
the
strip
but
finding
expert
water
witches
was
almost
as
difficult
as
finding
water
they
had
to
be
imported
from
some
remote
section
of
the
west
the
witches
as
we
called
them
went
over
various
parts
of
the
reservation
probing
poking
with
their
forked
sticks
the
divining
rod
was
a
simple
means
of
locating
water
and
it
had
been
in
common
use
through
the
ages
especially
in
arid
regions
it
was
used
in
some
instances
to
locate
other
underground
deposits
these
rods
were
pronged
branches
sometimes
of
willow
but
preferably
of
or
wild
cherry
if
there
were
water
close
to
the
surface
the
divining
rod
would
bend
and
turn
with
such
force
that
it
was
hard
to
keep
the
prongs
in
hand
it
was
said
to
work
by
a
process
of
natural
attraction
and
was
formerly
regarded
as
witchcraft
or
black
magic
our
divining
rods
refused
to
twist
or
bend
if
there
were
water
on
the
strip
the
witches
missed
it
either
that
or
it
was
too
deep
for
the
rods
to
detect
one
of
the
experts
said
there
was
indication
of
some
kind
of
liquid
deposit
far
underground
the
settlers
shook
their
heads
and
said
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
witches
or
the
divining
rod
and
ma
wagor
declared
i
never
did
have
any
faith
in
them
little
sticks
the
hot
winds
swept
the
plains
like
blasts
from
a
furnace
there
was
not
a
shelter
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
except
those
little
in
which
we
lived
as
the
sun
like
a
great
ball
of
fire
lowered
to
the
horizon
a
caravan
topped
the
ridge
from
the
north
and
moved
slowly
south
across
the
strip
a
wagon
and
a
buggy
its
dry
spokes
rattling
like
castanets
went
by
following
behind
were
the
few
head
of
stock
horses
whinnying
cows
bawling
for
water
a
panting
dog
tongue
hanging
out
trotted
beside
the
wagon
they
were
shipping
out
the
railroads
were
taking
emigrants
back
to
the
state
line
free
leaving
a
land
of
plenty
plenty
of
everything
but
water
a
number
of
homesteaders
who
had
come
to
stay
were
getting
out
settlers
were
proving
up
as
fast
as
they
could
they
wanted
to
prove
up
while
they
could
get
loans
on
the
land
loan
agencies
that
had
vied
with
one
another
for
the
business
were
closing
down
on
some
areas
despite
the
water
famine
the
brulé
had
built
such
prestige
had
made
such
a
record
of
progress
that
it
was
still
holding
the
business
western
bankers
kept
their
faith
in
it
but
the
lids
of
the
eastern
which
were
the
source
of
borrowing
power
might
be
clamped
down
any
day
the
railroads
were
taking
people
back
to
the
state
line
free
if
they
wished
to
go
it
seemed
to
me
exhausted
as
i
was
that
i
could
not
go
on
under
these
conditions
that
the
settlers
themselves
could
not
go
on
without
some
respite
i
walked
into
the
land
office
at
pierre
and
threw
a
sheaf
of
proof
notices
on
the
register
desk
he
looked
at
them
with
practiced
eyes
these
have
been
published
yet
he
said
i
do
want
them
i
leaving
the
country
i
came
to
get
nine
leave
of
absence
for
myself
and
all
those
whose
time
is
not
up
that
would
give
us
until
next
spring
to
come
back
and
get
our
deeds
he
leaned
over
his
desk
do
pull
up
and
leave
at
this
critical
time
edith
he
said
earnestly
there
are
the
legal
notices
the
loans
the
post
office
we
have
depended
on
you
so
much
it
would
be
putting
a
wrench
in
the
machinery
out
there
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
do
start
an
emigration
movement
like
that
he
warned
me
i
was
dumfounded
at
his
solemnity
at
the
responsibility
he
was
putting
upon
me
it
was
my
first
realization
of
the
fact
that
had
indeed
become
the
voice
of
the
brulé
that
where
it
led
people
would
follow
if
my
going
would
start
a
general
exodus
i
had
to
stay
i
walked
wearily
out
of
the
land
office
leaving
the
proofs
on
his
desk
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
endured
all
i
could
and
here
was
this
new
sense
of
community
responsibility
weighing
on
me
a
young
settler
drove
me
home
and
i
sat
bleakly
beside
him
it
was
late
when
we
got
near
my
claim
and
the
settlement
looked
dark
and
deserted
suddenly
i
screamed
startling
the
horses
and
leaped
from
the
wagon
as
there
was
a
loud
crash
the
heavy
timbers
of
the
cave
back
of
the
store
had
fallen
in
i
shouted
for
ida
mary
and
there
was
no
answer
from
the
shack
or
the
store
if
she
were
under
that
wreckage
frantically
we
clawed
at
the
timbers
clearing
a
space
looking
for
a
slip
of
a
girl
with
long
auburn
braids
of
hair
it
was
too
dark
to
see
clearly
and
in
my
terror
i
was
ripping
the
boards
in
any
fashion
while
jack
strove
to
quiet
me
what
the
matter
said
a
drowsy
voice
from
the
door
of
the
shack
it
was
ida
mary
who
had
slept
so
heavily
she
had
not
heard
our
arrival
or
our
shouts
or
the
crash
of
the
i
ran
to
her
sobbing
with
relief
the
cave
fallen
in
i
thought
maybe
you
were
in
it
she
blinked
sleepily
and
tried
to
comfort
me
i
all
right
sis
she
said
reassuringly
it
must
have
gone
down
after
i
went
to
bed
too
much
sod
piled
on
top
i
guess
now
we
have
to
have
that
fixed
as
i
lay
in
bed
shaking
with
fatigue
and
nerve
tension
ida
mumbled
drowsily
oh
the
fresh
butter
ma
brought
me
is
down
in
that
cave
and
she
fell
asleep
a
few
moments
later
i
too
was
sleeping
quietly
the
nights
were
the
the
evening
in
which
the
air
cooled
first
in
the
draws
then
lifted
softly
to
the
tableland
cooling
the
body
quenching
the
thirst
as
one
breathed
it
deeply
the
fresh
peaceful
night
the
early
dawn
which
like
a
rejuvenating
tonic
gave
one
new
hope
thus
we
got
our
second
wind
for
each
day
bout
the
next
day
the
proof
notices
i
had
turned
in
to
the
land
office
came
back
to
me
without
comment
i
explained
to
ida
mary
what
i
had
done
i
told
him
we
were
going
back
and
he
said
i
must
not
start
an
emigration
movement
i
applied
for
leaves
of
absence
while
the
railroads
are
taking
people
to
the
state
line
free
and
what
inquired
ida
mary
dryly
will
they
do
at
the
state
line
go
back
to
the
wife
kinfolk
i
suppose
she
was
right
of
course
i
began
to
see
what
this
trek
back
en
masse
would
mean
what
if
the
land
horde
went
marching
back
tens
of
thousands
of
them
milling
about
homeless
penniless
jobless
many
of
them
had
been
in
that
position
when
they
had
stampeded
the
frontier
looking
to
the
land
for
security
with
these
broad
areas
deserted
what
would
become
of
the
trade
and
business
of
the
new
railroads
and
other
developments
just
beginning
their
expansion
we
were
harder
hit
than
most
districts
by
the
lack
of
water
but
if
that
obstacle
could
be
solved
the
brulé
had
other
things
in
its
favor
the
words
of
the
register
came
back
to
me
do
start
an
emigration
movement
came
out
with
an
editorial
called
beyond
the
state
line
what
it
was
based
on
ida
mary
terse
comment
back
to
the
kinfolk
and
concluded
with
my
own
views
of
the
economic
disaster
which
such
a
general
exodus
would
cause
it
took
hold
settlers
who
were
ready
to
close
their
shacks
behind
them
paused
to
look
ahead
beyond
the
state
line
and
they
discovered
that
their
best
chance
was
to
fight
it
out
where
they
were
if
only
they
could
be
shown
how
to
get
water
no
trees
no
shade
hot
winds
sweeping
as
though
from
a
furnace
and
what
water
one
had
so
hot
and
stale
that
it
could
not
quench
thirst
we
could
ask
our
neighbors
to
share
their
last
loaf
of
bread
but
it
was
a
bold
selfish
act
to
ask
for
water
i
have
seen
a
gallon
bucket
of
drinking
water
going
down
have
seen
it
get
to
the
last
pint
have
held
the
hot
liquid
in
my
mouth
as
long
as
possible
before
swallowing
it
the
distances
to
water
were
so
long
that
many
times
we
found
it
impossible
with
all
the
work
we
had
on
hand
to
make
the
trip
so
we
would
save
every
drop
we
could
not
daring
to
cook
anything
which
required
water
one
of
the
girl
homesteaders
came
over
with
an
incredible
tale
to
tell
she
had
visited
one
of
the
settlers
outside
the
reservation
gate
who
had
a
real
well
and
his
wife
had
rinsed
the
dishes
when
she
washed
them
ma
prophesied
that
she
would
suffer
for
that
heine
said
one
day
my
pa
do
wanta
leave
we
ai
got
no
moneys
to
take
us
pa
says
there
were
many
families
in
the
same
position
get
out
where
how
one
day
when
chris
christopherson
came
in
i
asked
him
why
he
thought
the
water
supply
would
be
better
in
a
year
or
so
we
can
dig
better
dams
if
they
bane
twice
so
big
this
year
they
be
full
now
from
the
snows
and
rains
we
would
yet
have
water
plenty
we
could
dig
cisterns
could
we
cost
money
but
not
so
much
like
deep
wells
trouble
bane
we
not
have
money
yet
nor
time
to
make
ready
so
many
some
of
the
farmers
say
i
told
him
that
when
we
cultivate
large
areas
loosening
the
soil
for
moisture
absorption
they
will
be
able
to
get
surface
wells
especially
in
the
draws
they
say
the
tall
heavy
grass
absorbs
the
surface
and
underground
water
chris
nodded
thoughtfully
water
will
be
more
comin
in
time
he
declared
the
more
land
plowed
the
more
moisture
will
go
down
in
the
soil
it
all
the
time
costs
more
money
to
move
and
settle
yet
than
to
stay
where
you
are
and
nobody
knows
what
he
find
somewhere
else
again
and
we
got
thirstier
and
thirstier
i
got
to
have
a
drink
i
would
wail
you
get
over
it
ma
would
assure
me
but
we
did
not
always
get
over
it
i
remember
trying
to
go
to
bed
without
a
drink
one
night
and
thinking
i
could
not
stand
it
until
morning
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
woke
ida
mary
i
so
thirsty
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
let
hitch
up
and
go
for
some
water
so
off
we
went
in
the
middle
of
the
night
driving
over
to
mcclure
where
we
drank
long
and
long
at
the
watering
troughs
with
few
water
holes
left
some
of
the
settlers
went
over
the
border
hauling
water
from
outside
from
mcclure
even
from
presho
when
they
went
to
town
somehow
they
got
enough
to
keep
them
from
perishing
men
cleaned
out
their
dams
in
case
it
should
rain
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
drought
breaking
except
for
the
early
matured
crops
the
fields
were
burned
the
later
crops
were
dwarfed
our
spirits
fell
as
we
looked
at
our
big
field
of
flax
which
had
given
such
promise
seed
which
had
had
no
rain
lay
in
the
ground
unsprouted
some
of
the
farmers
turned
their
surplus
stock
loose
to
forage
for
themselves
men
like
senator
scotty
phillips
and
ben
smith
a
rancher
living
four
miles
from
the
settlement
dug
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
for
water
ben
smith
went
down
feet
there
was
no
sign
of
water
despondency
gripped
the
people
you
can
dig
clear
to
hell
and
you
wo
find
water
one
of
them
declared
all
right
boys
ben
smith
told
them
dig
to
hell
if
you
have
to
and
do
mind
the
cost
slowly
the
drill
bored
on
down
the
dry
hole
ben
smith
folly
they
called
it
urged
the
people
to
put
their
resources
together
water
food
everything
so
that
they
might
keep
going
until
water
was
found
or
until
it
rained
today
pooling
is
a
common
method
of
farm
marketing
we
have
great
wheat
pools
milk
pools
and
many
others
at
that
time
there
were
cooperative
pools
in
a
few
places
although
i
had
never
heard
of
one
nor
of
a
farm
organization
but
it
was
the
pooling
system
that
was
needed
to
carry
on
of
one
thing
there
was
no
doubt
the
grass
on
the
indian
lands
greener
than
the
grass
on
the
settlers
lands
through
their
land
ran
the
missouri
river
and
they
had
water
to
spare
while
the
homesteaders
were
famishing
and
their
stock
dying
for
water
it
was
going
to
waste
in
indian
territory
that
area
was
as
peaceful
as
though
the
whole
frontier
were
filled
with
clear
cool
streams
so
ida
mary
and
i
went
to
the
indians
for
help
i
presume
we
should
have
gone
to
the
agency
but
we
had
never
seen
the
government
officials
in
charge
and
we
did
know
our
indians
we
rode
over
into
the
little
indian
settlement
rows
of
and
canvas
wigwams
indians
sitting
around
on
the
ground
men
whittling
doing
beadwork
or
lounging
at
ease
squaws
sitting
like
mummies
or
cooking
over
open
fires
for
which
they
broke
or
chopped
wood
young
bucks
riding
about
horses
grazing
peacefully
mongrel
dogs
in
profusion
children
dirty
unconcerned
playing
in
the
sun
rows
of
meat
drying
on
the
lines
they
were
peaceful
and
unconcerned
the
whole
settlement
had
about
it
the
air
of
being
on
a
holiday
the
lazy
aftermath
of
a
holiday
remembering
the
hard
labor
the
anxiety
the
effort
and
strain
and
despair
in
the
white
settlement
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
this
life
effortless
without
responsibility
sprawling
in
the
shade
while
others
did
the
work
it
was
not
before
these
members
of
the
tribe
however
that
we
presented
our
request
we
went
before
the
chief
and
his
council
with
form
and
ceremony
the
old
chief
dressed
in
dignified
splendor
sat
on
a
stool
in
front
of
his
wigwam
a
rich
navajo
rug
under
his
feet
he
had
been
a
great
leader
wise
and
shrewd
in
making
negotiations
for
his
tribe
he
looked
at
me
and
grunted
i
explained
at
length
that
i
had
come
to
him
from
the
brulé
white
men
for
help
but
i
got
no
farther
he
threw
out
his
hand
in
a
negative
gesture
the
old
warriors
of
the
council
were
resentful
obstinate
they
muttered
and
shook
their
heads
angrily
no
favors
to
the
whites
who
had
robbed
them
of
their
lands
i
sat
down
beside
the
chief
while
i
talked
to
him
and
then
to
other
members
of
the
council
to
porcupine
bear
little
thunder
night
pipe
the
indian
demands
pomp
and
ceremony
in
the
transaction
of
affairs
these
wanted
to
hold
a
powwow
but
i
had
no
time
for
ceremony
the
indians
had
water
we
had
none
if
some
of
the
settlers
could
run
stock
on
their
hunting
ground
where
they
could
get
to
water
and
if
we
could
have
water
hauled
from
their
lands
we
would
pay
the
old
chief
sat
as
immobile
and
dignified
as
a
king
in
court
we
soon
learned
that
the
indian
traders
are
a
different
species
from
the
high
powers
of
the
tribe
sitting
in
council
making
treaties
it
was
like
appearing
before
a
high
tribunal
take
indian
lands
all
time
more
grunted
one
of
them
the
settlers
land
is
no
good
to
the
indian
i
argued
no
water
no
berries
no
wood
no
more
value
the
government
is
making
the
whites
pay
money
not
giving
them
allotments
as
they
do
the
red
men
if
they
would
not
give
us
i
went
on
we
could
not
print
the
paper
any
more
or
keep
or
trade
for
posts
they
went
into
ceremonious
council
and
delivered
their
concession
officially
by
an
interpreter
little
thunder
i
think
it
was
attired
in
all
his
regalia
of
headdress
with
eagle
feathers
beaded
coat
and
fringed
breeches
it
appealed
to
their
sense
of
power
to
grant
the
favor
at
last
the
whites
had
to
come
to
them
for
help
whether
the
deal
was
official
or
unofficial
no
one
cared
in
those
crucial
days
washington
seemed
to
the
homesteaders
as
remote
as
the
golden
gates
we
took
a
back
there
was
not
a
single
building
anywhere
in
sight
and
the
only
moving
thing
was
a
herd
of
range
cattle
going
slowly
toward
water
through
the
silence
came
a
deep
moaning
sound
the
most
eerie
distressed
sound
i
ever
heard
i
was
passing
an
indian
cemetery
and
beside
a
grave
stood
an
indian
woman
alone
with
her
dead
as
is
the
indian
custom
she
had
come
alone
walking
many
miles
across
the
plain
she
would
probably
slash
her
breast
or
mutilate
her
flesh
in
some
other
way
as
a
sacrament
to
her
grief
as
i
rode
on
slowly
her
wailing
cry
rose
and
fell
until
it
grew
dim
in
my
ears
blending
with
the
moaning
sound
of
the
wind
some
of
the
settlers
turned
stock
over
on
the
indian
lands
after
our
negotiations
and
the
indians
hauled
loads
of
water
to
the
print
shop
now
and
then
our
collection
of
antique
animals
we
turned
loose
to
go
back
and
live
off
the
indians
might
be
it
will
rain
heine
said
one
day
did
you
see
that
cloud
come
by
in
front
of
the
moon
last
night
but
it
was
a
cloud
it
was

xiv
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
we
were
living
in
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
the
famous
hunting
ground
of
the
brulé
indians
whose
name
was
derived
from
a
great
prairie
fire
which
had
once
swept
the
land
the
story
of
that
great
fire
was
told
me
by
a
famous
interpreter
who
had
heard
the
tale
many
times
from
his
grandfather
it
was
three
seasons
after
the
big
flood
of
he
said
and
the
grass
was
high
on
bad
river
bringing
many
buffalo
down
from
the
north
about
two
weeks
after
the
leaves
turned
they
went
to
the
prairie
to
get
the
winter
meat
being
a
hunting
party
the
women
and
children
accompanied
them
the
young
boys
wandered
from
the
camps
shooting
prairie
dogs
and
small
birds
one
day
when
a
number
of
boys
were
returning
to
camp
a
great
prairie
fire
swept
down
from
the
north
the
boys
ran
for
the
river
but
the
fire
was
too
swift
for
them
and
they
were
overtaken
throwing
themselves
on
the
ground
they
turned
their
faces
from
the
fire
and
wrapped
their
heads
and
bodies
in
their
robes
waiting
for
the
fire
to
pass
where
they
lay
the
grass
was
high
and
there
were
many
small
bushes
so
when
the
fire
came
the
ground
was
hot
and
they
were
all
burned
on
the
right
thigh
though
otherwise
unhurt
the
escape
of
the
boys
was
considered
so
remarkable
that
the
sioux
called
this
tribe
the
people
with
the
burnt
thigh
apparently
some
french
trader
rendered
the
name
into
his
language
and
thus
we
have
brulé
or
burned
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
was
famous
not
only
for
its
great
prairie
fire
and
the
fact
that
it
had
been
the
feeding
ground
of
the
buffalo
which
had
come
in
big
herds
to
winter
pasture
but
also
because
it
had
been
a
notorious
rendezvous
for
horse
thieves
in
the
early
days
lawless
gangs
turned
to
stealing
horses
instead
of
robbing
banks
a
bold
outfit
of
horse
thieves
plied
their
trade
over
a
vast
section
of
the
bad
river
country
of
which
the
brulé
had
been
a
part
here
in
the
tall
grass
they
found
refuge
and
feed
for
the
horses
with
water
in
the
creeks
and
water
holes
almost
the
year
around
in
the
night
they
would
drive
their
loot
in
and
the
law
was
helpless
in
dealing
with
them
much
has
been
said
of
indians
stealing
the
white
man
horses
and
little
of
the
depredations
of
the
whites
upon
the
indians
these
gangs
stole
constantly
from
the
indians
taking
the
best
of
their
herds
a
little
band
of
indians
realizing
that
they
must
get
back
their
horses
at
any
cost
tracked
the
thieves
and
here
on
the
burnt
thigh
attacked
them
but
they
were
driven
back
by
the
outlaws
who
had
their
lookout
according
to
the
indians
on
the
very
site
of
ammons
concealing
themselves
here
in
the
tall
grass
they
could
see
anyone
approaching
for
miles
around
they
had
seen
the
indians
coming
just
as
we
had
seen
them
that
first
day
at
the
settlement
the
gang
opened
fire
killed
several
of
their
number
and
routed
the
rest
the
indians
made
no
protest
all
they
knew
of
law
was
the
power
of
the
government
a
force
not
to
be
appealed
to
for
protection
but
rather
one
against
which
the
red
men
must
struggle
for
their
rights
they
had
no
recourse
therefore
against
the
thieves
and
it
was
not
until
the
national
guard
was
sent
to
round
them
up
that
this
lawless
band
was
tracked
to
its
lair
and
captured
on
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
that
summer
the
grass
was
dry
and
nowhere
was
there
water
with
which
to
fight
fire
heat
waves
like
vapor
came
up
from
the
hard
dry
earth
one
could
see
them
as
they
rose
from
the
parched
ground
like
thin
smoke
from
the
heat
expansion
and
the
sudden
contraction
when
the
cool
of
the
night
came
on
the
earth
cracked
open
in
great
crevices
like
wide
thirsty
mouths
into
which
horses
stumbled
and
fell
beneath
their
riders
a
young
couple
went
to
town
one
day
and
returned
that
night
looking
for
their
home
they
wandered
around
their
claim
seeking
their
shack
it
lay
in
ashes
destroyed
by
a
prairie
fire
heine
came
wading
through
the
hot
yellow
grass
did
you
carry
matches
with
you
heine
nope
he
answered
laconically
i
do
need
no
matches
suppose
a
prairie
fire
should
come
everyone
was
supposed
to
carry
matches
no
child
was
allowed
to
leave
home
without
matches
and
instructions
to
if
he
saw
a
fire
coming
heine
sat
down
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
with
the
sleeve
of
his
little
shirt
i
look
first
behind
when
i
start
ca
no
prairie
fire
come
till
i
get
here
but
with
these
hot
winds
we
watched
constantly
for
the
first
sign
of
smoke
sacks
old
heavy
comforts
and
pieces
of
carpet
were
kept
at
hand
as
fire
extinguishers
in
case
there
were
enough
water
on
hand
to
wet
them
which
was
seldom
there
were
no
more
water
holes
and
it
got
dryer
and
hotter
ben
men
were
still
drilling
for
water
they
were
down
feet
from
the
print
shop
we
could
hear
the
drill
grinding
through
hard
earth
prairie
fires
began
to
break
out
all
around
the
strip
the
homesteaders
began
to
be
afraid
to
leave
their
shacks
for
fear
they
would
find
them
gone
on
their
return
ammunition
for
the
fight
was
pitifully
meager
they
fought
with
plows
that
turned
firebreaks
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
fire
beat
it
out
with
their
wet
sacks
if
fire
ever
got
a
start
on
the
burnt
thigh
now
with
its
thick
high
grass
as
dry
as
powder
and
no
water
every
habitation
would
be
completely
annihilated
protests
about
our
lack
of
protection
seethed
until
they
found
expression
in
the
newspaper
we
had
no
equipment
no
fire
fighters
no
lookouts
no
rangers
surely
the
government
owed
us
some
means
of
fighting
the
red
devil
of
the
plains
one
evening
when
the
parched
ground
was
beginning
to
cool
we
noticed
a
strange
yellow
haze
settling
over
the
earth
felt
a
murky
heat
the
world
was
on
fire
not
near
the
settlement
miles
away
it
must
be
probably
on
the
indian
lands
beyond
the
strip
from
the
heat
in
the
air
the
threatening
stillness
the
alertness
of
the
animals
as
they
lifted
their
heads
high
in
the
air
with
nostrils
dilated
we
knew
it
was
coming
toward
us
the
heavy
reddish
fog
portended
a
big
fire
its
tongue
of
flame
lapping
up
everything
as
it
came
already
a
group
of
homesteaders
was
gathering
at
the
print
shop
organizing
systematic
action
men
from
every
section
hurrying
in
with
little
sacks
and
kegs
of
water
splashing
until
they
were
half
empty
a
pathetic
inadequate
defense
to
set
up
against
so
gigantic
an
enemy
chris
christopherson
rattled
by
with
his
tractor
to
turn
broad
furrows
dave
dykstra
who
would
never
set
the
world
on
fire
but
would
do
a
good
deal
in
putting
it
out
hastened
up
to
help
here
they
came
men
with
kegs
of
water
men
with
pieces
of
carpet
men
with
nothing
but
their
hands
and
their
fear
to
pit
against
the
fire
off
to
the
south
the
sky
was
red
now
and
the
smell
of
fire
was
in
our
nostrils
faint
but
unmistakable
none
of
us
knew
how
fast
a
big
fire
could
travel
the
settlers
still
knew
so
pitiably
little
about
combating
the
frontier
from
the
indian
settlement
came
swift
running
deer
on
the
horse
which
had
taken
the
state
fair
prize
last
year
in
sioux
the
young
buck
was
too
excited
to
remember
his
english
he
said
the
fire
was
on
beyond
the
brulé
somewhere
most
of
the
indians
had
ridden
off
to
it
while
he
had
come
to
tell
the
whites
if
the
wind
stay
down
it
mebbe
no
come
but
heap
big
fire
like
that
take
two
day
three
day
mebbe
seven
to
die
it
was
still
and
peaceful
now
but
there
was
little
hope
that
two
or
three
days
could
pass
without
wind
and
if
the
wind
came
from
that
direction
there
was
no
hope
for
the
brulé
coyote
cal
who
had
come
riding
through
the
strip
stopped
at
the
print
shop
ida
mary
tried
to
persuade
him
to
ride
around
to
the
homesteads
and
tell
the
girls
who
lived
alone
that
the
fire
was
still
a
long
way
off
and
that
men
had
gone
to
fight
it
coyote
cal
stretched
his
long
angular
figure
to
full
height
and
stood
there
hesitant
no
miss
i
ruther
fight
fire
he
said
at
length
but
the
girls
will
be
frantic
with
fear
hai
no
use
a
over
a
prairie
fire
if
it
gits
yuh
it
gits
yuh
an
that
all
there
is
to
it
with
these
consoling
words
he
swung
into
the
saddle
and
turned
his
horse
head
toward
the
fire
ma
wagor
came
outside
where
ida
mary
and
i
watched
the
reflection
of
flame
against
the
darkening
sky
the
air
was
still
there
was
no
wind
i
goin
home
to
milk
the
cow
ma
announced
she
had
paid
forty
dollars
for
that
cow
she
reminded
us
and
she
wanted
every
last
drop
of
milk
out
of
her
besides
she
did
believe
in
anybody
leaving
this
world
hungry
the
red
dusk
found
the
plains
stirring
the
ominous
silence
was
broken
by
rumbling
wagons
hurrying
with
their
barrels
of
water
tractors
chugging
turning
long
fresh
rows
of
dirt
as
breaks
teams
everywhere
plowing
around
shacks
and
corrals
night
came
on
inky
black
the
red
light
on
the
horizon
and
billowy
clouds
of
smoke
intensified
the
darkness
over
the
range
cattle
were
bellowing
in
their
mad
fear
of
fire
they
were
coming
closer
to
the
reservation
fence
running
from
danger
the
hours
crept
past
around
us
on
the
plains
the
settlers
had
done
all
they
could
and
they
were
waiting
as
ida
mary
and
i
were
waiting
watching
the
red
glow
on
the
sky
thinking
of
the
men
who
were
desperately
beating
out
the
advancing
flames
wondering
if
each
tiny
gust
foretold
the
coming
of
the
wind
inside
the
shack
we
moved
about
restlessly
putting
the
money
we
had
on
hand
in
tin
cans
the
legal
paper
in
the
little
strong
box
and
burying
them
in
the
small
shallow
cave
if
the
fire
came
we
would
seek
refuge
there
ourselves
but
it
would
be
much
use
we
knew
that
out
again
to
look
at
the
sky
and
then
up
and
down
the
print
shop
restlessly
up
and
down
ida
mary
made
coffee
we
had
to
do
something
and
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
wait
wait
and
listen
to
the
silence
and
look
our
own
fear
squarely
in
the
eyes
and
know
it
for
what
it
was
what
that
said
ida
mary
in
a
queer
hoarse
voice
she
put
down
her
cup
and
sat
rigid
listening
then
she
jumped
to
her
feet
her
face
white
edith
she
cried
it
the
wind
it
the
wind
out
of
nowhere
came
the
moaning
sound
of
the
wind
sweeping
unchecked
across
space
blowing
from
the
south
while
we
listened
with
caught
breath
it
seized
some
papers
and
sent
them
rattling
across
the
table
blew
a
lock
of
hair
in
my
eyes
made
the
dry
grass
rustle
so
that
it
sounded
for
one
glorious
moment
like
rain
we
ran
outside
and
stood
in
the
darkness
our
dresses
whipping
around
us
looking
at
the
sky
here
and
there
above
the
red
haze
we
saw
a
bright
jagged
tongue
of
flame
leap
up
licking
the
black
sky
the
homesteaders
who
had
not
gone
to
the
fire
found
waiting
alone
intolerable
and
one
by
one
they
drifted
in
to
the
store
waiting
taut
and
silent
at
midnight
we
heard
the
staccato
beats
of
a
horse
hoofs
a
messenger
was
coming
only
one
horse
on
the
plains
could
travel
like
that
it
was
black
indian
and
a
moment
later
lone
star
len
flung
himself
from
the
horse
and
came
in
he
had
been
fighting
flame
his
face
was
blackened
almost
beyond
recognition
it
all
right
he
said
at
once
before
we
could
question
him
the
fire
over
on
the
government
land
it
beyond
the
strip
his
eyes
and
lips
were
swollen
face
and
hands
blistered
it
still
ragin
he
went
on
but
there
is
a
little
creek
dry
mostly
between
the
fire
and
the
strip
it
not
likely
to
get
this
far
the
wind
is
bad
it
blowin
sparks
across
on
the
grass
this
side
of
the
creek
but
some
of
the
settlers
and
indians
are
watchin
it
ida
mary
came
in
from
the
shack
with
sandwiches
and
black
coffee
and
set
them
before
him
you
did
need
to
bother
doin
that
for
me
he
protested
you
girls
better
go
to
bed
when
did
you
have
anything
to
eat
ida
mary
asked
as
he
drank
the
hot
coffee
and
devoured
the
food
ravenously
moving
his
hands
as
though
they
hurt
him
unbearably
this
mornin
been
working
with
that
fire
since
noon
i
had
started
for
the
when
i
smelt
smoke
lone
star
why
did
you
risk
your
life
to
save
a
reservation
full
of
homesteaders
i
asked
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
a
chagrined
expression
on
his
face
cattle
needs
the
grass
he
replied
as
he
stalked
out
and
rode
slowly
wearily
away
into
the
night
the
fire
had
broken
out
on
range
and
government
land
off
toward
the
white
river
country
to
the
southeast
where
lone
star
rode
herd
as
the
country
for
the
most
part
was
uninhabited
the
fire
had
swept
the
plains
for
miles
before
the
fighters
reached
it
sparks
and
flames
had
jumped
the
creek
but
by
now
the
grass
was
burned
back
far
enough
on
both
sides
so
that
the
danger
for
this
region
was
past
the
amused
natives
told
how
a
man
had
jolted
up
on
a
stiff
horse
a
painting
outfit
in
his
saddlebag
to
watch
the
fire
this
is
great
he
exclaimed
as
he
plied
brush
and
color
then
as
a
volley
of
wild
sparks
shot
across
the
narrow
stream
and
went
into
flame
nearby
he
threw
down
the
brush
rushed
in
among
the
worked
madly
until
the
flames
were
extinguished
then
went
back
and
finished
the
picture
who
is
he
someone
in
the
gaping
crowd
asked
the
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
a
brulé
settler
answered
for
several
days
longer
the
fire
raged
with
the
air
smoky
and
a
red
and
black
pall
over
the
earth
then
it
faded
as
our
other
terrors
had
faded
and
was
gone
already
in
the
midst
of
fire
and
water
famine
there
stalked
ghosts
of
cold
and
hunger
the
coming
winter
with
no
money
left
to
provide
the
necessities
of
life
the
homesteaders
stared
into
the
face
of
a
food
famine
most
of
them
were
now
living
on
meager
rations
counting
every
penny
their
crops
shriveled
in
the
fields
ada
put
her
small
wages
into
flour
and
coffee
and
heine
remarked
my
ma
says
might
be
we
starve
and
freeze
yet
she
goin
to
pray
we
watched
him
trudge
back
across
the
plains
a
sturdy
little
fellow
one
suspender
holding
up
patched
overalls
over
a
faded
blue
shirt
bare
feet
which
walked
fearlessly
and
by
some
miracle
escaped
the
constant
menace
of
rattlesnakes
ragged
straw
hat
shading
the
serious
round
face
the
plains
had
made
him
old
beyond
his
six
years
with
the
realization
of
danger
which
the
prairie
fire
had
brought
began
to
advocate
government
rangers
and
lookouts
to
be
stationed
at
strategic
points
i
was
in
the
print
shop
writing
an
article
on
conditions
when
lone
star
came
in
i
want
to
get
my
paper
forwarded
miss
printer
he
stated
leavin
the
country
it
gettin
too
crowded
in
these
parts
too
lonesome
i
do
see
how
people
can
live
huddled
up
with
somebody
on
every
where
are
you
going
now
goin
to
an
range
country
he
said
a
country
but
rich
feed
you
can
get
away
from
landgrabbers
there
all
creation
where
shall
i
send
the
paper
wyoming
the
rawhide
country
just
send
the
paper
to
lost
trail
be
goin
on
there
i
know
a
cattleman
around
lost
trail
rawhide
country
lost
trail
about
them
was
the
atmosphere
of
space
of
solitude
and
peace
i
may
go
there
myself
some
day
i
told
him
if
you
do
he
said
soberly
leave
this
doggone
newspaper
shebang
behind
it
a
pest
to
the
country
do
clutter
up
any
more
range
with
homesteadin
herds
worse
than
grasshoppers
at
least
the
grasshoppers
leave
and
the
homesteaders
appear
to
be
here
to
stay
he
rode
off
a
strange
solitary
figure
topped
the
ridge
and
dropped
out
of
sight
as
swiftly
as
he
had
appeared
that
first
morning
stopping
the
eagle
in
its
flight
when
he
had
gone
i
turned
back
to
my
article
in
this
gigantic
homestead
project
declared
there
should
be
protection
we
demanded
of
the
local
land
offices
why
the
department
of
the
interior
did
not
establish
service
bureaus
on
government
territory
to
expedite
development
to
lessen
hardship
and
danger
but
the
land
offices
could
not
help
us
they
were
only
the
machines
of
the
public
lands
department
the
federal
government
was
taking
in
revenue
by
the
millions
from
the
homesteaders
millions
of
acres
of
homestead
land
at
from
to
an
acre
provided
a
neat
income
for
the
united
states
treasury
and
we
contended
the
homesteaders
of
america
should
be
given
consideration
there
was
nothing
radical
about
these
articles
but
here
again
i
became
known
as
that
little
outlaw
printer
had
i
been
experienced
i
might
have
carried
this
appeal
to
washington
and
said
put
the
revenue
from
these
lands
back
into
them
that
is
not
charity
it
is
development
of
natural
resources
any
such
entreaty
coming
from
an
upstart
of
a
girl
printer
would
have
been
like
a
lamb
bleating
at
a
blizzard
but
the
homesteaders
might
have
been
organized
as
a
unit
with
official
power
to
petition
for
aid
i
did
not
know
then
that
i
could
do
such
things
meantime
the
print
shop
buzzed
with
activity
the
harvest
of
proofs
on
which
i
had
gambled
the
paper
was
on
it
kept
one
person
busy
with
the
clerical
work
on
them
while
the
strip
was
yet
a
land
i
had
pledged
the
printing
equipment
company
proofs
as
collateral
that
was
a
low
estimate
as
a
matter
of
fact
won
an
record
publishing
in
one
week
proofs
the
highest
number
ever
to
be
published
in
any
issue
of
a
newspaper
of
which
the
government
had
record
from
the
department
of
the
interior
from
the
land
office
from
other
newspapers
congratulations
poured
in
it
seems
to
me
that
some
sort
of
medal
was
awarded
to
us
for
that
it
was
the
record
which
mattered
of
course
to
us
the
publication
of
these
notices
signified
that
the
settlers
had
stuck
it
out
with
parched
throats
to
get
their
deeds
that
some
acres
of
wasteland
had
passed
into
private
units
in
one
week
time
it
meant
endless
work
type
numbers
checking
straining
eyes
and
nerves
beyond
endurance
but
it
also
meant
for
that
one
lot
over
income
for
the
newspaper
proof
money
had
been
coming
in
for
several
weeks
every
mail
brought
long
heavy
envelopes
from
the
land
office
containing
proof
applications
made
there
from
among
the
homesteaders
we
hired
amateur
typesetters
to
help
out
and
anybody
who
happened
to
be
handy
turned
the
press
on
occasion
we
resorted
to
old
indian
warriors
and
once
to
a
notorious
cattle
rustler
and
all
this
time
we
watched
the
sky
for
rain
and
skimmed
the
green
scum
from
the
dam
water
to
drink
looking
up
from
the
type
one
morning
i
saw
an
old
indian
standing
before
me
old
porcupine
bear
slipping
in
on
moccasined
feet
an
indian
would
appear
before
one
without
warning
at
first
this
sudden
materializing
at
my
elbow
had
alarmed
me
but
i
had
long
grown
accustomed
to
it
old
porcupine
bear
was
a
character
one
of
the
very
old
warriors
who
seldom
left
camp
one
never
knew
how
old
some
of
these
aged
indians
were
and
many
of
them
did
not
know
themselves
how
many
seasons
they
had
lived
this
old
man
we
figured
must
be
a
hundred
years
old
will
there
be
rain
porcupine
i
asked
him
will
you
hold
your
rain
dance
soon
the
deep
wrinkles
in
his
leathery
face
were
hard
set
as
if
from
pain
his
hair
streaked
with
gray
and
hanging
loose
over
his
shoulders
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
combed
for
days
he
wailed
my
woman
him
sick
the
fever
goin
die
he
dropped
his
face
into
the
palm
of
his
hard
hand
and
let
it
lie
there
motionless
in
demonstration
of
her
passing
he
wanted
to
get
a
box
like
white
squaws
had
the
boxes
in
which
they
went
to
the
happy
hunting
ground
he
was
on
the
road
to
pierre
for
a
coffin
others
of
the
tribe
we
gathered
had
put
in
money
to
help
buy
it
he
opened
a
beaded
sack
and
showed
us
there
was
enough
to
buy
a
pretty
good
one
in
broken
sioux
and
signs
we
advised
him
to
wait
he
shook
his
head
stubbornly
his
herbs
he
was
a
medicine
man
who
had
healed
many
sick
ones
had
not
worked
even
his
had
failed
the
indian
was
his
shield
against
disease
against
all
evil
it
drives
the
evil
spirit
away
it
may
be
anything
he
selects
an
herb
a
stone
a
rabbit
foot
so
long
as
he
selects
it
secretly
and
divulges
to
no
one
what
it
is
the
is
invested
with
divine
curative
power
according
to
the
indians
when
he
got
back
to
his
wigwam
with
the
porcupine
bear
found
his
cooking
supper
so
the
old
brave
it
was
said
slept
in
the
good
soft
bed
himself
why
not
said
ida
mary
he
had
slept
on
the
ground
and
fought
many
hard
battles
let
him
have
his
cushioned
resting
place
while
he
could
enjoy
it
but
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
a
week
or
so
later
he
came
again
it
was
a
day
when
i
was
at
the
breaking
point
he
stood
looking
at
me
shaking
his
head
as
he
had
done
over
his
i
must
have
looked
like
a
ghost
for
in
a
gesture
of
friendship
he
said
you
want
my
the
prairie
fire
had
not
got
me
down
but
at
the
thought
of
that
box
i
went
to
bed
and
stayed
there
three
days
illustration
xv
up
in
smoke
there
was
almost
in
the
tin
box
down
in
the
trunk
ready
to
be
deposited
at
breakfast
we
exulted
over
it
the
ammons
sisters
were
always
draining
the
bank
dry
sedgwick
would
open
his
eyes
when
we
walked
into
the
bank
with
that
bag
of
money
we
planned
to
go
to
presho
that
day
it
was
hardly
safe
to
have
so
much
money
in
the
shack
and
we
were
eager
to
put
it
in
a
safe
place
it
represented
months
of
planning
and
effort
and
hard
work
but
the
labor
did
seem
bad
to
look
back
on
that
morning
not
with
the
reward
at
hand
it
had
been
worth
while
because
the
end
of
the
road
was
in
sight
and
we
had
accomplished
much
that
we
had
hoped
to
do
more
in
some
respects
it
was
unbearably
hot
that
morning
and
we
decided
against
the
trip
to
presho
after
all
one
more
day
would
matter
and
the
sun
was
so
scorching
we
quailed
at
the
thought
of
that
long
ride
there
was
an
ominous
oppression
in
the
air
and
heat
waves
made
the
ground
appear
to
waver
before
our
eyes
here
and
there
flames
flared
up
without
any
explainable
origin
as
though
from
the
heat
of
the
grass
itself
the
day
crept
on
to
and
the
hot
wind
came
up
from
the
ground
blistering
our
faces
there
was
no
one
near
the
print
shop
where
the
metal
was
hot
to
the
touch
no
movement
over
the
plains
we
sent
our
helpers
home
while
ma
ida
mary
and
i
moved
about
languidly
doing
only
what
was
absolutely
necessary
there
was
a
curious
acrid
smell
in
the
air
as
though
a
bolt
of
lightning
had
struck
i
stopped
my
work
on
the
paper
and
cried
out
what
that
fire
screamed
ida
mary
fire
smoke
enveloped
us
there
was
a
deafening
crackle
blinding
red
flame
we
ran
to
the
door
and
there
not
ten
feet
away
our
shack
was
burning
to
the
ground
the
little
kitchen
covered
with
tar
paper
was
sending
its
flames
high
into
the
air
frantically
we
ran
to
the
front
door
shouting
above
the
crackling
and
roar
of
flame
the
trunk
the
money
the
settlers
money
the
print
shop
would
go
too
and
the
notices
had
several
weeks
to
run
but
the
essential
thing
was
to
get
the
money
back
we
must
do
that
must
oh
for
a
rolling
bank
on
wheels
at
the
front
door
black
smoke
came
rolling
out
choking
us
ida
mary
threw
a
sack
over
her
head
and
started
into
the
shack
ma
wagor
and
i
dragged
her
back
into
the
open
air
the
building
was
burning
as
though
it
had
been
made
of
paper
a
torch
of
orange
flames
we
watched
it
go
home
money
clothes
a
few
valuable
keepsakes
furniture
everything
we
possessed
licked
up
by
the
flames
the
piano
too
i
was
glad
it
had
brought
so
much
pleasure
to
the
settlers
the
wind
now
the
fire
was
spreading
the
print
shop
was
burning
its
inflammable
tar
paper
and
dry
boards
blazing
like
powder
hurry
hurry
we
called
frantically
to
each
other
from
the
print
shop
i
grabbed
the
most
valuable
papers
while
ida
mary
snatched
what
she
could
from
the
post
office
stoical
silent
making
every
move
count
ma
wagor
was
busy
in
the
store
her
store
in
which
she
had
taken
such
pride
and
such
infinite
pleasure
ma
was
getting
more
confusement
now
than
she
had
bargained
for
blinded
with
smoke
we
caught
up
the
sacks
into
which
we
had
stuffed
the
papers
and
threw
them
into
the
cave
the
only
shelter
left
on
the
whole
claim
in
less
than
thirty
minutes
the
post
office
the
store
with
its
supply
of
food
the
print
shop
were
gone
the
harvest
of
long
months
of
labor
and
storm
thirst
and
fire
vanished
as
though
it
had
never
been
gone
up
in
clouds
of
heavy
black
smoke
if
the
wind
would
only
go
down
we
groaned
but
the
sparks
had
already
caught
the
grass
around
us
a
prairie
fire
if
it
ever
jumped
those
breaks
the
strip
would
be
devastated
with
the
wind
sweeping
the
plain
as
it
was
doing
what
irony
that
we
who
had
printed
our
precautions
and
warnings
for
others
should
burn
up
the
strip
we
who
had
labored
so
to
save
it
and
there
was
no
chance
for
us
we
could
not
outrun
a
prairie
fire
the
horses
which
were
untied
had
gone
full
speed
across
the
prairie
at
the
first
smell
and
sight
of
fire
now
the
oilhouse
had
caught
and
we
turned
running
headlong
across
the
plains
our
feet
burning
not
knowing
where
we
were
going
so
long
as
we
could
escape
the
explosion
of
the
oil
inside
the
firebreaks
the
grass
was
burning
listening
for
the
explosion
of
the
oil
was
like
waiting
for
the
crack
of
doom
then
we
remembered
pa
wagor
had
sunk
the
barrels
underground
using
siphons
just
in
case
of
fire
sparks
leaping
up
flying
across
the
breaks
the
prairie
was
on
fire
we
checked
our
flight
sanity
returning
with
the
emergency
we
had
to
go
back
simply
had
to
go
back
and
fight
that
first
outbreak
of
flame
the
strip
was
at
stake
life
and
property
were
at
stake
falling
rising
running
falling
again
dragging
each
other
up
we
went
back
help
we
called
to
the
empty
prairie
help
there
was
nothing
to
smother
the
blaze
not
a
thing
not
even
a
sack
or
a
hat
we
tore
off
parts
of
the
clothes
from
our
scantily
clad
bodies
ma
took
off
her
petticoat
there
was
a
sack
in
the
barn
which
we
wet
in
a
keg
set
in
the
yard
wet
the
canvas
which
covered
the
keg
with
that
with
our
feet
we
trampled
down
the
sparks
as
they
fell
the
flames
as
they
rose
shoes
hot
and
charred
holes
burning
through
across
the
prairie
a
team
was
coming
at
a
dead
run
bless
the
lord
ma
wagor
panted
it
sam
frye
a
bright
red
flare
shot
up
from
behind
and
around
me
my
dress
was
on
fire
ida
mary
clawed
dirt
from
the
ground
and
with
it
in
her
hands
twisted
my
burning
smock
into
knots
to
keep
the
flames
from
spreading
with
almost
animal
instinct
i
threw
myself
down
in
the
firebreak
pressing
hard
against
the
ground
to
extinguish
any
smoldering
sparks
on
my
clothing
and
lay
panting
cooling
in
the
dirt
sam
frye
the
was
there
taking
charge
all
at
once
a
crowd
had
gathered
attracted
by
the
leaping
flames
on
what
had
been
the
settlement
of
ammons
running
to
fight
the
threatening
prairie
fire
men
went
to
work
fighting
fresh
outbursts
of
flames
and
putting
out
fire
on
the
ruins
women
hovered
about
us
in
sympathy
some
with
tears
streaming
down
their
sunburned
cheeks
under
the
straw
hats
and
bonnets
neither
sister
nor
i
could
shed
a
tear
dazed
and
dizzy
we
stumbled
back
across
the
breaks
to
the
charred
ashes
of
our
labors
apart
from
the
tangible
losses
that
lay
in
coals
the
newspaper
the
voice
of
the
brulé
was
gone
down
into
frontier
history
senator
phillips
said
into
it
had
gone
the
ambitions
the
heartbreaking
labor
the
vision
of
two
girls
our
scanty
clothing
burned
and
torn
hair
singed
faces
and
parts
of
our
bodies
scorched
and
black
with
smoke
tar
paper
makes
black
smudgy
smoke
eyes
red
and
burning
we
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
open
spaces
that
had
dealt
us
their
blow
our
worked
that
was
all
but
at
least
we
had
checked
the
prairie
fire
we
had
won
that
much
from
the
brulé
the
burned
land
we
clung
to
each
other
wordlessly
there
was
nothing
to
say
everything
that
made
up
our
daily
life
and
our
plans
for
the
future
had
been
wiped
out
in
thirty
minutes
we
still
have
the
claim
ida
mary
murmured
at
last
nothing
can
destroy
the
land
but
all
our
bright
hopes
how
the
fire
got
such
a
start
before
we
detected
it
was
a
mystery
with
the
shack
walls
already
burning
hot
and
the
strong
wind
it
had
been
like
spontaneous
combustion
ma
wagor
was
baking
bread
on
an
old
oil
stove
perhaps
a
draft
from
the
open
window
had
fanned
the
fire
but
the
origin
did
matter
now
ma
wagor
had
worked
heroically
helping
us
to
save
the
important
records
the
mail
and
the
prairie
from
being
swept
by
fire
when
it
was
all
over
she
did
not
whimper
about
her
loss
when
i
saw
pa
coming
i
ran
to
her
ma
here
comes
pa
this
will
kill
him
you
had
better
go
meet
him
he
had
not
wanted
her
to
buy
the
store
in
the
first
place
now
there
were
debts
piled
up
and
only
the
homestead
to
pay
them
she
sat
on
the
ground
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
let
him
come
to
me
she
replied
it
his
place
to
comfort
me
in
time
of
trouble
true
to
her
feminine
intuition
he
went
to
her
and
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
elizabeth
he
said
no
response
elizabeth
he
entreated
do
give
way
like
this
we
will
pull
through
somehow
i
felt
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
alex
van
leshout
voice
hoarse
in
my
ear
the
latchkey
of
the
circle
v
is
on
the
outside
if
you
girls
will
come
over
i
move
out
if
you
need
me
or
all
i
have
is
at
your
service
you
a
good
indian
edith
sometimes
i
envy
the
women
who
are
able
during
a
catastrophe
to
stop
and
grieve
over
it
i
never
seem
to
have
had
the
time
there
was
always
something
that
demanded
to
be
done
whatever
the
circumstances
the
fire
had
no
sooner
been
put
out
the
claim
bare
as
the
day
i
first
saw
it
save
for
charred
grass
and
a
great
mound
of
ashes
and
the
smell
of
smoke
when
sam
frye
opened
the
mail
sacks
sitting
bedraggled
in
his
old
buggy
ida
mary
distributed
the
mail
to
the
patrons
who
had
gathered
even
though
the
post
office
was
gone
the
mail
must
go
on
we
were
never
destined
to
be
the
sultry
tragic
day
came
to
a
close
with
the
plains
light
long
after
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
the
ammons
settlement
gone
and
a
devastating
sense
of
emptiness
ida
mary
and
i
realized
that
we
had
no
place
to
go
with
typical
frontier
hospitality
every
home
on
the
reservation
was
open
to
us
but
that
night
we
longed
to
be
alone
it
commiseration
we
needed
but
quiet
in
which
to
grasp
what
had
happened
to
us
we
decided
on
margaret
shack
left
vacant
when
she
had
proved
up
she
had
left
a
few
household
essentials
there
there
some
of
the
frontier
women
followed
us
to
bathe
and
salve
the
burns
we
had
forgotten
bandaging
those
which
were
the
worst
i
had
suffered
most
when
my
clothing
caught
fire
but
miraculously
there
were
no
serious
burns
they
left
us
alone
as
night
came
ma
and
pa
wagor
ida
mary
and
me
it
was
ma
who
roused
first
from
the
general
lethargy
in
which
we
were
all
steeped
she
began
bustling
around
guess
we
better
have
something
to
eat
she
said
briskly
there
nothing
left
to
eat
ida
mary
reminded
her
triumphantly
ma
brought
forth
a
big
bundle
tied
up
in
her
old
gingham
apron
in
it
were
cans
of
salmon
tomatoes
and
other
essential
foods
and
a
can
of
pineapple
ma
panacea
for
all
ills
i
knew
we
be
hungry
after
all
that
so
i
jerked
up
a
little
stuff
while
you
were
getting
the
papers
out
she
brought
in
an
armful
of
prairie
hay
built
a
fire
in
the
cookstove
and
made
strong
tea
she
was
no
longer
the
clinging
vine
of
an
hour
before
and
there
in
the
little
shack
down
the
draw
penniless
almost
naked
all
our
belongings
and
our
plans
for
the
future
in
charred
ashes
on
the
claim
we
slept
from
exhaustion
no
matter
with
what
finality
things
seem
to
end
there
is
always
a
next
day
and
a
next
during
those
first
few
hours
the
extent
of
our
disaster
had
dazed
us
then
the
odds
seemed
so
overwhelmingly
against
us
that
there
was
no
use
in
going
on
the
only
trouble
was
that
we
stop
post
office
or
no
post
office
there
was
the
mail
print
shop
or
no
print
shop
there
were
the
proof
notices
we
were
like
the
cowboy
who
hanging
to
a
running
steer
tail
was
dragged
against
the
hard
ground
and
through
brush
until
he
was
cut
battered
and
bruised
fearing
he
would
be
killed
the
other
cowboys
who
watched
shouted
wildly
to
him
let
go
let
go
let
go
hell
he
yelled
back
it
all
i
can
do
to
hold
on
then
there
was
jack
ammons
back
in
the
earlier
days
of
illinois
who
had
become
critically
ill
from
some
lingering
disease
of
long
standing
one
day
the
doctor
called
aunt
jane
aside
and
said
jane
if
jack
has
any
business
matters
to
attend
to
it
had
better
be
done
at
once
i
do
think
he
can
last
another
hours
from
the
bedroom
came
a
weak
irritable
voice
jane
jane
where
my
boots
uncle
jack
got
up
fought
the
disease
and
lived
and
prospered
for
many
a
year
we
came
of
a
family
who
died
with
their
boots
on
i
do
know
whether
it
was
a
streak
of
jack
or
whether
like
the
cowboy
we
held
on
because
we
could
not
let
go
the
latter
perhaps
for
we
saw
no
way
of
escape
many
times
i
think
people
get
too
much
credit
for
hanging
on
to
things
as
a
virtue
when
they
are
simply
following
the
line
of
least
resistance
we
saw
no
means
of
escape
and
were
too
stunned
to
plan
of
one
thing
we
were
sure
we
would
not
go
back
home
for
help
there
would
have
to
be
some
way
of
telling
our
father
of
the
misfortune
so
as
to
soften
the
blow
as
much
as
possible
but
we
were
determined
not
to
add
to
his
burdens
which
were
already
too
heavy
for
him
if
the
railroad
company
takes
us
to
the
state
line
declared
ida
mary
it
will
have
to
take
us
crated
or
furnish
us
covering
in
the
garish
morning
light
indeed
we
felt
rather
naked
in
those
flimsy
torn
clothes
the
only
garments
we
now
owned
we
ca
go
back
anyhow
i
reminded
her
we
ca
leave
things
unfinished
the
proof
notices
have
to
finish
running
and
sam
frye
will
be
throwing
the
mail
sack
in
at
the
door
it
was
easier
to
get
into
things
than
to
get
out
the
settlers
came
that
day
with
their
widow
mite
of
food
and
clothes
the
women
clothing
too
large
the
children
too
small
but
it
covered
us
after
a
fashion
the
store
at
presho
sent
out
a
box
of
supplies
coyote
cal
and
sourdough
rode
up
beats
tarnation
now
do
it
coyote
cal
consoled
us
i
told
you
this
country
was
fit
for
nothin
but
cowhands
growled
sourdough
here
the
punchers
rounded
up
a
little
chicken
feed
he
fairly
threw
at
us
a
dirty
tobacco
pouch
filled
with
coins
coming
before
pay
day
like
this
tai
much
he
grumbled
as
though
the
catastrophe
might
have
waited
for
pay
day
things
could
be
done
to
suit
sourdough
a
wagonload
of
indians
drove
up
men
and
squaws
and
papooses
they
climbed
out
unhitched
turned
the
team
loose
to
graze
they
came
in
mumbling
in
a
sort
of
long
wail
but
gleeful
as
children
over
the
gifts
they
carried
a
shawl
thick
hot
blankets
beaded
moccasins
there
was
a
sack
of
corn
in
the
milk
roasting
ears
which
had
been
raised
over
by
the
river
and
stripped
dried
meat
we
did
not
know
whether
it
was
cow
horse
or
dog
but
we
knew
it
had
been
black
with
flies
as
it
hung
on
the
lines
drying
we
had
seen
them
drying
meat
however
parboiling
should
make
it
clean
and
early
that
morning
we
saw
imbert
coming
from
presho
hurrying
to
ida
mary
his
face
drawn
and
haggard
they
went
into
each
other
arms
without
a
word
and
at
last
ida
mary
was
able
to
cry
tears
of
sorrow
and
relief
with
her
face
against
his
breast
i
lay
weak
and
ill
wasting
from
a
slow
fever
i
slept
fitfully
while
streams
of
cool
water
went
gurgling
by
and
cool
lemonade
barrels
of
it
but
every
time
i
stooped
to
take
a
drink
the
barrels
went
rattling
across
the
plain
into
a
prairie
fire
maybe
you
got
typhoid
ma
would
say
as
she
bathed
my
hot
head
and
hands
with
towels
wrung
out
of
vinegar
and
warm
water
fanning
them
to
coolness
you
be
all
right
sis
ida
mary
would
say
just
hold
on
we
did
not
call
a
doctor
there
was
no
money
left
for
doctors
rest
sleep
and
nourishment
were
what
i
needed
but
conditions
were
far
from
favorable
for
such
a
cure
the
deserted
shack
was
baking
hot
it
was
not
the
cheerful
place
it
had
seemed
while
margaret
lived
in
it
with
the
bare
floor
the
old
kitchen
stove
the
sagging
wire
couch
and
a
couple
of
kitchen
chairs
we
had
scanty
sticky
food
and
warm
sickening
water
we
did
even
bother
to
keep
it
clean
the
routine
of
our
life
had
been
burned
away
the
handful
of
dishes
went
dirty
the
floor
went
unswept
but
ma
brought
milk
and
custards
that
she
had
made
at
home
i
drank
the
juice
of
dried
fruits
and
imbert
brought
us
water
from
the
millers
well
we
sank
jars
of
it
deep
into
the
ground
to
keep
cool
heine
broke
a
new
trail
across
the
plains
and
a
few
days
after
the
fire
the
horses
came
home
they
had
wandered
back
to
the
old
site
snorted
at
the
black
ruins
and
gone
thundering
across
the
prairie
led
by
lakota
with
the
wild
horse
fear
of
fire
we
never
expected
to
see
them
again
but
one
day
they
saw
sam
frye
coming
with
the
mail
they
followed
him
down
the
draw
and
when
he
stopped
and
threw
out
the
mail
sack
lakota
gave
a
loud
neigh
and
walked
straight
into
margaret
old
barn
where
the
mail
sacks
went
was
home
to
lakota
moving
the
post
office
around
the
prairie
piling
the
mail
in
an
open
box
in
the
corner
may
have
been
criminally
illegal
but
we
gave
it
no
thought
the
mail
in
a
haphazard
fashion
was
being
handled
our
next
problem
was
the
proof
notices
they
must
go
on
it
was
vital
to
the
settlers
many
of
them
could
not
live
without
the
money
they
were
borrowing
on
the
final
proofs
without
the
press
there
seemed
no
solution
to
that
problem
on
the
sixth
day
after
the
fire
ida
mary
got
up
early
while
i
slept
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
she
made
a
blast
from
the
dry
grass
under
one
cap
of
the
stove
boiled
coffee
ate
her
lean
breakfast
and
put
food
on
a
chair
beside
my
bed
then
she
darkened
the
room
slipped
out
saddled
lakota
rode
up
to
the
cave
and
brought
out
the
mail
sack
of
legal
papers
we
had
saved
from
the
fire
she
took
out
the
notices
those
in
course
of
publication
and
others
due
to
be
published
then
she
rode
on
to
mcclure
made
arrangements
with
the
printer
of
the
mcclure
and
began
setting
up
the
notices
when
the
stage
came
in
that
noon
with
the
ammons
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
senn
the
proof
king
offering
us
the
use
of
the
shop
and
service
of
his
printer
to
meet
the
emergency
although
we
had
cornered
the
great
proof
business
on
the
lower
brulé
he
was
coming
to
our
rescue
to
save
it
for
us
that
night
ida
mary
came
home
hot
weary
with
lines
of
fatigue
in
her
youthful
face
and
about
her
blue
eyes
but
there
was
a
resolute
look
too
marking
her
strong
will
and
in
her
voice
a
tone
of
satisfaction
it
was
a
long
arduous
task
setting
up
again
all
those
notices
in
small
type
the
type
of
the
mcclure
shop
would
not
set
half
of
the
notices
we
sent
the
balance
of
them
to
be
set
some
in
presho
some
in
pierre
got
them
back
by
stage
and
despite
fire
and
all
other
obstacles
went
on
with
its
work
a
few
days
late
strictly
a
proof
sheet
but
without
lapse
of
publication
and
ida
mary
kept
things
going
conserving
her
strength
as
well
as
she
could
with
imbert
and
ma
wagor
helping
ma
said
i
died
if
i
had
found
something
to
do
it
was
with
no
sign
of
the
drought
breaking
in
the
shack
down
the
draw
we
sat
during
spare
hours
sorting
type
at
kitchen
table
picking
separating
letters
and
spaces
leads
slugs
ma
wagor
and
other
neighbors
helped
at
odd
times
heine
separated
the
type
into
piles
of
like
sizes
sorting
that
was
a
job
to
which
no
one
in
the
world
but
a
printer
can
give
the
deserved
sympathy
heine
raking
around
in
the
cooling
embers
on
my
claim
had
found
several
cases
of
pied
type
and
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
printing
equipment
down
under
a
piece
of
heavy
tin
roofing
the
only
thing
salvaged
from
the
wreckage
a
committee
of
settlers
came
emptied
a
little
sack
on
the
table
in
a
little
heap
there
lay
pennies
dimes
quarters
a
few
silver
dollars
precious
coins
that
had
been
put
aside
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
and
a
separate
roll
of
bills
the
offering
of
the
lower
brulé
settlers
to
build
a
new
shack
and
print
shop
they
said
simply
the
homesteaders
will
do
the
building
of
course
we
must
build
another
shack
and
reestablish
residence
or
there
would
be
no
deed
to
the
land
the
money
represented
not
only
the
savings
but
the
loyal
support
of
the
settlers
when
we
protested
they
laughed
but
has
always
been
telling
us
to
share
they
said
some
of
the
business
men
of
the
towns
added
to
the
contribution
to
establish
the
newspaper
one
sweltering
day
with
everyone
seeking
escape
from
the
broiling
sun
all
movement
over
the
strip
was
suspended
as
i
lay
on
the
couch
recuperating
there
came
a
great
explosion
that
roared
through
the
dead
hush
like
all
the
cannons
of
war
gone
off
at
once
ida
mary
resting
in
the
shade
of
the
shack
came
running
in
it
could
not
be
thunder
for
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
it
had
come
from
over
cedar
fork
way
soon
the
plains
were
astir
with
settlers
rushing
in
the
direction
of
the
explosion
a
great
rumbling
force
was
sending
steam
high
into
the
air
it
was
ben
smith
folly
he
had
struck
gas
enough
to
pipe
house
and
barns
for
light
and
fuel
then
came
a
heaving
belching
from
far
down
in
the
earth
cavern
and
up
came
the
water
a
great
stream
of
it
that
ran
over
the
dry
hot
ground
water
overflowing
that
artesian
well
flowing
day
and
night
would
save
the
people
and
stock
until
it
rained
and
with
the
flowing
of
fresh
cool
water
on
the
lower
brulé
life
began
to
flow
through
my
veins
once
more
and
i
got
up
ready
for
what
was
to
come
illustration
xvi
fallowed
land
so
it
happened
that
only
a
few
weeks
before
time
ida
mary
and
i
had
to
start
all
over
again
but
with
the
coming
of
water
into
that
thirsty
land
it
did
seem
so
difficult
to
begin
again
and
we
were
doing
it
alone
it
was
the
settlers
who
built
a
new
shack
a
new
building
for
a
printing
press
the
settlers
who
clothed
us
during
those
first
destitute
days
this
is
cooperation
they
laughed
at
our
protests
has
always
preached
cooperation
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
i
rode
out
over
the
devastated
prairie
past
the
charred
timbers
and
ashes
of
my
claim
across
the
scorched
and
stunted
fields
blighted
by
drought
avoiding
the
great
cracks
which
had
opened
in
the
dry
earth
and
lay
gaping
like
thirsty
mouths
for
rain
the
crops
were
burnt
and
the
land
which
had
seemed
so
fertile
looked
bleak
and
sterile
i
rode
through
the
reservation
gate
there
was
no
one
at
home
at
huey
dunn
but
his
little
field
of
shocked
grain
lay
there
in
the
midst
of
burnt
grass
and
unharvested
fields
instead
of
dry
chaff
there
were
hard
fairly
heads
it
had
withstood
the
drought
sufficiently
to
mature
in
an
average
year
it
would
have
yielded
a
good
crop
on
his
claim
near
the
reservation
a
young
man
was
doing
quite
a
bit
of
experimenting
he
was
a
graduate
of
an
agricultural
school
i
looked
at
his
fields
which
also
had
come
through
the
drought
much
better
than
others
from
other
farmers
scattered
here
and
there
who
had
tried
the
fallowing
plan
i
got
records
of
methods
and
results
then
i
rode
back
slowly
thinking
of
what
might
be
done
for
the
brulé
country
drinking
water
supply
could
be
obtained
the
next
most
vital
problem
was
moisture
for
the
crops
most
of
the
rainfall
came
in
the
growing
season
but
in
dry
years
it
was
inadequate
and
much
of
it
wasted
on
packed
ground
to
produce
crops
in
the
arid
or
regions
moisture
heavy
snows
and
rains
must
be
conserved
there
must
be
a
way
to
harness
it
next
to
lack
of
moisture
was
the
short
growing
season
these
were
the
principal
barriers
to
converting
the
new
west
into
an
agricultural
domain
the
latter
problem
could
be
solved
the
farmers
said
progress
already
was
being
made
in
developing
seed
adapted
to
the
climate
the
indians
had
produced
corn
through
their
years
of
in
a
small
way
there
could
be
developed
a
hardier
grain
eating
up
less
moisture
agricultural
authorities
maintained
the
farmers
said
that
nature
itself
gradually
would
do
a
great
deal
toward
that
end
experience
science
time
of
course
this
was
a
land
of
the
future
not
of
today
the
homesteaders
had
expected
to
tame
it
in
a
year
or
two
when
many
years
must
be
spent
on
even
the
smallest
scientific
discoveries
they
had
demanded
miracles
that
was
because
they
had
no
resources
with
which
to
await
results
president
roosevelt
had
done
much
in
turning
public
attention
toward
the
necessity
of
reclaiming
these
public
lands
and
already
much
was
being
done
they
had
been
too
long
neglected
years
ago
when
the
supply
of
government
land
had
seemed
inexhaustible
the
tide
of
settlers
had
swept
around
the
forgotten
frontier
on
beyond
the
arid
and
land
to
the
fertile
soil
and
the
gold
fields
on
the
pacific
coast
but
the
time
had
come
when
this
neglected
prairie
was
the
only
land
left
for
a
people
some
way
had
to
be
found
to
make
the
great
arid
plains
productive
the
department
of
agriculture
was
turning
its
attention
to
the
frontier
establishing
bureaus
and
experiment
stations
in
various
western
states
making
scientific
research
at
the
request
of
two
agricultural
agents
from
the
state
experimental
farm
came
to
examine
the
soil
and
advise
us
as
to
its
possibilities
as
to
crops
and
cultivation
they
reported
it
rich
in
natural
resources
with
splendid
subsoil
we
would
have
to
depend
greatly
upon
the
subsoil
and
its
quality
and
over
the
frontier
there
was
talk
about
a
new
system
of
conserving
moisture
some
said
it
was
bound
to
sweep
the
west
the
method
was
called
fallowing
the
method
huey
dunn
had
used
it
was
a
radical
departure
from
anything
farmers
of
the
rain
belts
had
ever
used
the
few
sodbreakers
who
had
tried
it
thought
they
had
found
a
way
to
conserve
the
moisture
and
at
the
same
time
to
preserve
the
land
but
it
was
not
they
who
heralded
the
plan
as
a
great
new
discovery
to
them
it
was
a
way
to
raise
their
own
crops
they
may
have
learned
it
in
the
old
country
where
intensive
farming
was
carried
on
or
like
huey
dunn
figured
it
out
for
themselves
but
it
was
ahead
of
the
times
in
the
new
west
and
generally
looked
upon
as
an
impractical
idea
spread
largely
by
land
agents
as
propaganda
many
of
the
farmers
had
never
heard
of
it
what
i
had
heard
and
read
of
fallowing
now
came
back
to
mind
i
was
in
a
position
to
keep
better
posted
on
such
things
than
they
i
got
out
my
letters
and
records
and
spread
them
before
ida
mary
on
the
old
square
table
and
with
the
sweat
dripping
down
our
faces
from
the
heat
of
the
lamp
we
eagerly
devoured
their
contents
huey
dunn
plan
of
mellowing
or
rotting
the
soil
was
not
yet
the
true
fallowing
method
but
it
will
mean
cropping
the
land
only
every
other
year
and
plowing
and
raking
the
empty
soil
ida
mary
said
in
a
tone
of
misgiving
the
top
soil
is
kept
loosened
so
that
every
bit
of
moisture
will
be
absorbed
into
the
subsoil
suppose
it
does
mean
letting
the
land
lie
idle
every
other
year
alternating
the
fields
i
contended
there
is
plenty
of
cheap
land
here
it
will
be
a
way
to
utilize
waste
space
farmers
in
other
arid
regions
i
learned
as
i
scanned
the
letters
were
raising
forage
crops
on
the
land
in
the
off
year
but
it
will
take
two
years
ida
mary
reminded
me
the
settlers
had
no
money
to
wait
so
long
for
a
crop
and
all
that
labor
she
went
on
it
may
be
the
solution
but
i
doubt
if
the
settlers
would
listen
to
any
such
plan
i
knew
she
was
right
two
years
of
waiting
labor
and
expense
labor
was
no
small
item
with
the
poor
homesteaders
if
the
government
would
put
in
money
to
carry
out
this
new
system
until
the
farmers
could
get
returns
from
it
it
is
a
gigantic
project
for
the
government
to
finance
it
would
require
great
financial
corporations
to
develop
this
country
halbert
donovan
had
said
i
talked
it
over
with
some
of
the
more
experienced
farmers
on
the
strip
who
understood
the
processes
required
they
figured
they
could
plant
part
of
the
ground
while
the
other
lay
fallowing
if
it
happened
to
be
a
wet
year
that
would
give
them
something
to
go
on
but
mein
gott
how
we
goin
to
pull
next
winter
old
man
husmann
raved
even
chris
had
no
answer
in
the
years
of
experimenting
the
fallowing
system
underwent
a
number
of
changes
but
we
had
the
plan
in
its
fundamentals
after
each
rain
the
land
should
be
loosened
and
late
in
the
fall
it
should
be
plowed
rather
deeply
to
soak
up
the
winter
snows
the
top
soil
must
be
kept
from
packing
it
was
worth
trying
they
agreed
if
they
could
get
money
to
pull
through
this
drought
and
stay
on
the
land
this
might
be
a
solution
for
the
future
but
for
the
people
on
the
land
the
solution
must
be
immediate
empty
purses
could
not
wait
two
seasons
for
a
good
crop
empty
stomachs
could
not
await
the
future
and
famine
stared
the
homesteaders
on
the
lower
brulé
in
the
face
our
proof
sheet
came
out
with
the
message
we
can
fallow
there
was
encouragement
to
be
derived
from
it
of
course
but
it
was
hope
deferred
then
sitting
in
the
doorway
of
the
shack
leaning
against
the
jamb
for
support
my
pencil
held
in
tender
fingers
not
yet
healed
i
wrote
to
halbert
donovan
setting
forth
the
possibilities
of
the
strip
and
the
west
under
a
method
of
farming
it
was
a
morning
in
late
august
when
i
turned
to
see
a
man
standing
in
the
open
door
halbert
donovan
at
the
first
meeting
he
had
found
the
west
green
and
bright
with
spring
colors
and
the
outlaw
printer
of
the
mcclure
excited
and
voluble
over
the
possibilities
of
the
country
now
the
investment
broker
found
a
land
of
desolation
and
ruin
and
the
printer
in
sorry
plight
living
in
a
crude
bare
shack
clad
like
some
waif
of
the
streets
in
the
clothes
donated
by
the
settlers
but
he
had
come
he
had
driven
out
from
pierre
along
the
dusty
roads
through
the
sultry
heat
in
a
long
shiny
automobile
on
the
sagging
couch
leaning
against
the
hot
wall
he
sat
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
as
i
told
him
more
of
the
fallowing
idea
he
had
not
heard
of
it
he
knew
practically
nothing
about
agriculture
but
he
was
a
man
to
whom
any
method
of
developing
vast
resources
would
appeal
at
first
he
said
little
crinkles
breaking
around
his
eyes
relieving
the
sternness
of
his
face
i
read
how
i
did
laugh
at
the
name
you
gave
it
with
refreshing
amusement
out
of
a
personal
curiosity
you
had
aroused
i
wanted
to
see
how
long
you
would
hold
out
later
i
became
deeply
interested
in
this
western
activity
i
knew
in
what
mood
he
must
have
reached
the
shack
after
that
drive
from
pierre
across
parched
earth
seeing
the
ruined
crops
passing
settlers
homes
which
from
the
outside
looked
like
the
miserable
huts
one
sees
along
waterfronts
or
in
mean
outskirts
of
a
city
where
the
flotsam
of
humanity
live
and
cluttered
around
them
farm
machinery
washtubs
and
all
the
other
junk
that
could
be
left
outdoors
with
countless
barrels
for
hauling
water
and
the
inevitable
pile
of
tin
cans
it
was
dreary
it
was
unrelievedly
ugly
above
all
it
looked
like
grim
failure
earnestly
i
faced
him
we
are
done
i
told
him
we
just
begun
badly
i
know
but
we
can
fallow
make
reservoirs
put
down
artesian
wells
i
completely
forgot
in
putting
these
possibilities
of
the
strip
before
him
to
mention
the
gas
and
oil
deposits
which
we
had
discovered
during
our
frantic
search
for
water
i
did
not
think
of
saying
we
have
natural
gas
here
let
go
and
look
at
the
ben
smith
ranch
with
all
its
buildings
piped
with
gas
and
over
on
the
carter
place
a
drill
came
up
from
a
shallow
hole
sticky
with
oil
but
the
minds
of
the
settlers
were
so
focused
elsewhere
that
little
had
been
said
about
these
things
with
an
investment
broker
interested
in
mining
projects
under
my
very
roof
many
of
us
might
have
become
rich
and
the
brulé
prosperous
in
no
time
development
of
agriculture
to
my
mind
was
of
broader
importance
than
oil
strikes
anyhow
men
do
put
money
into
undeveloped
things
i
said
eastern
capitalists
risk
millions
in
undeveloped
mines
and
oil
fields
in
the
west
this
is
different
land
is
solid
he
answered
thoughtfully
as
an
investment
land
is
not
so
precarious
as
mines
but
there
are
no
big
profits
to
be
reaped
from
it
that
the
difference
my
girl
he
must
have
known
that
even
for
investors
western
land
was
going
to
be
a
big
thing
he
must
have
known
that
the
railroad
companies
were
buying
it
up
that
the
milwaukee
had
gone
into
a
spree
of
land
buying
in
lyman
county
i
poured
him
some
water
from
the
can
we
kept
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
back
of
the
shack
for
coolness
he
took
a
swallow
and
set
it
down
good
lord
how
can
anyone
drink
that
he
exclaimed
we
get
used
to
it
i
told
him
and
we
have
a
better
water
supply
in
time
it
will
rain
it
bound
to
rain
sooner
or
later
he
looked
out
at
the
blazing
sky
the
baked
earth
a
snake
slithering
from
the
path
back
into
the
dry
grass
which
rustled
as
it
moved
so
this
is
the
land
you
want
to
save
he
exclaimed
the
incredible
thing
is
that
people
have
managed
to
stay
on
it
at
all
they
will
stay
i
assured
him
remember
that
these
builders
have
had
nothing
to
work
with
no
direction
no
system
or
leadership
what
would
business
men
accomplish
in
such
an
undertaking
under
the
circumstances
if
they
had
experienced
leaders
men
like
you
in
other
words
he
smiled
laying
up
riches
where
moth
and
rust
do
corrupt
he
walked
to
the
door
and
stood
hands
in
pockets
looking
out
over
the
plains
then
he
turned
to
face
me
my
dear
girl
i
might
not
be
worth
a
hoot
at
the
job
oh
you
would
you
would
and
if
the
settlers
never
repaid
you
think
what
a
land
king
you
would
become
i
laughed
no
i
do
want
the
land
that
way
i
want
to
see
the
settlers
succeed
try
to
keep
them
from
being
squeezed
out
he
mopped
his
face
picked
up
the
glass
of
water
and
after
a
glance
at
it
set
it
down
untouched
now
i
been
thinking
of
this
western
development
for
some
time
it
going
to
open
up
new
business
in
almost
every
field
aside
from
all
that
it
is
worth
while
i
kept
track
of
you
and
your
brulé
if
one
gets
his
money
back
here
it
is
all
he
can
expect
how
much
would
be
needed
to
help
these
settlers
hold
on
a
little
grubstake
some
future
operating
money
i
like
this
fallowing
idea
he
talked
about
second
mortgages
collateral
on
personal
property
appointment
of
local
agents
etc
he
did
not
want
the
source
of
this
borrowing
power
to
become
known
as
yet
it
was
he
who
brought
me
back
to
my
personal
predicament
when
ready
to
leave
he
expressed
his
desire
to
help
me
asking
if
i
would
accept
a
check
for
you
and
your
sister
to
carry
on
but
i
refused
i
had
appealed
to
him
for
the
country
not
for
myself
but
his
offer
mortified
me
made
me
conscious
of
my
shabby
appearance
the
coarse
clothes
the
effects
of
the
fire
still
visible
in
rough
and
skin
the
splotches
of
new
skin
on
my
lips
the
face
pink
and
tender
altogether
the
surroundings
and
i
must
have
made
a
drab
spectacle
holding
out
his
hand
to
say
halbert
donovan
saw
my
shrinking
embarrassment
suddenly
he
put
his
arm
around
my
shoulders
drew
me
to
him
brushed
back
the
singed
hair
and
pressed
his
lips
to
my
forehead
turned
my
small
blackened
hand
palm
upward
looking
at
it
i
help
you
all
i
can
he
said
just
keep
your
utopian
dreams
so
it
happened
that
before
famine
could
touch
these
people
who
had
already
struggled
through
drought
and
blizzard
and
despair
they
found
help
in
sight
halbert
donovan
put
up
as
a
start
to
be
dealt
out
for
emergency
on
land
livestock
etc
heretofore
loans
had
been
made
on
land
only
now
the
reliability
of
the
borrower
himself
was
often
taken
into
account
as
collateral
it
was
enough
that
we
knew
the
borrower
was
honest
that
he
was
doing
his
best
to
conquer
the
land
and
to
make
it
yield
we
gambled
on
futures
then
as
we
had
done
before
that
it
was
eastern
capital
handled
through
a
system
of
exchange
and
agencies
was
all
that
those
who
borrowed
knew
or
cared
and
each
day
we
scanned
the
heavens
for
signs
of
rain
we
searched
for
a
cloud
like
a
starving
man
for
bread
the
settlers
went
stalking
about
with
necks
craned
heads
thrown
back
eyes
fixed
on
the
sky
and
the
cartoonist
from
milwaukee
took
to
looking
for
a
cloud
with
a
field
glass
a
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
would
raise
the
hopes
of
the
whole
reservation
but
in
vain
we
searched
the
metallic
blue
of
the
sky
with
spectacular
ceremonial
and
regalia
the
indians
staged
their
rain
dance
the
missionaries
had
long
opposed
this
form
of
expression
by
the
indians
and
their
objections
led
to
a
government
ban
which
was
finally
modified
to
permit
some
sort
of
ritual
these
symbolic
dances
were
not
mere
ceremonials
for
the
plains
indians
they
were
their
one
means
of
expressing
their
emotions
en
masse
rhythmically
of
maintaining
their
sense
of
tribal
unity
the
first
part
of
the
ceremony
was
secret
and
lasted
for
several
days
after
that
the
public
ceremony
began
painted
according
to
ritual
they
danced
in
a
line
from
east
to
west
and
back
again
whistling
as
they
danced
every
gesture
having
its
symbolic
meaning
the
whistle
symbolized
to
them
the
call
of
the
thunderbird
pioneers
belong
to
the
past
people
are
prone
to
say
savage
customs
belong
to
the
past
but
it
was
in
the
twentieth
century
that
primitive
men
their
bodies
streaked
with
black
paint
fasted
and
danced
overcoming
an
enemy
as
they
danced
compelling
the
thunderbird
to
release
the
rain
and
on
the
strip
men
and
women
prayed
as
fervently
to
their
own
god
each
in
his
own
way
that
night
something
breaking
the
dead
stillness
woke
me
a
soft
slow
tapping
on
the
roof
of
the
shack
like
ghostly
fingers
it
increased
in
tempo
as
though
birds
in
this
land
without
trees
were
pecking
at
the
roof
it
grew
to
a
regular
drumming
sound
i
lay
for
a
few
moments
listening
wondering
then
i
leaped
out
of
bed
ran
to
the
door
and
stepped
outside
rain
rain
rain
ida
mary
i
called
get
up
it
raining
she
was
out
of
bed
in
a
moment
as
though
someone
had
shouted
fire
in
nightdress
bare
feet
we
ran
out
on
the
prairie
reached
up
our
hands
to
the
soft
cool
soothing
drops
which
fell
slowly
as
though
hesitating
whether
to
fall
or
not
and
then
it
poured
the
grass
was
wet
beneath
our
feet
we
lifted
our
heads
opened
our
lips
and
drank
in
the
cool
fresh
drops
i
lay
down
on
the
cool
blanket
of
earth
absorbing
its
reviving
moisture
into
my
body
feeling
the
rain
pattering
on
my
flesh
over
the
prairie
dim
lights
flickered
through
the
rain
men
and
women
rushed
out
to
hail
its
coming
and
to
put
tubs
and
buckets
under
the
roofs
no
drop
of
this
miracle
must
be
wasted
in
their
joy
and
relief
some
of
the
homesteaders
unable
to
sleep
hitched
up
and
drove
across
the
plains
to
rejoice
with
their
friends
after
that
eternity
of
waiting
it
rained
and
rained
until
the
earth
all
about
was
green
and
fresh
native
hay
came
out
green
and
seed
burst
out
of
the
ground
some
of
the
late
crops
matured
there
was
water
in
the
dams
the
thirsty
land
drank
deep
of
the
healing
rains
the
air
grew
fresh
and
cool
haggard
faces
were
alight
with
hope
the
lower
brulé
became
a
different
place
where
once
again
people
planned
for
the
future
unafraid
to
look
ahead
with
the
mail
bag
the
salvaged
type
and
margaret
few
sticks
of
furniture
which
she
wrote
to
us
to
take
we
moved
back
to
the
homestead
to
the
site
of
ammons
the
settlers
had
the
building
up
this
time
it
was
a
little
house
made
of
drop
siding
no
more

a
thin
partition
running
halfway
to
the

divided
the
small

the
mcclure
had
died
the
natural

the

and
the

was
submerged
in
the
cause
of
prohibition
later
he
was
appointed
federal
prohibition
agent
for
the
state
of
south
dakota
he
gave
us
most
of
the
mcclure

so
i
got
that

after
all
what
few

were

to
be
made
in

were
thrown
to
with
the

bought
the

ida

were

at

ida

was
sure
and
there
was
no
need
of
waiting
any
longer
so
she
went
back
to
louis
for
the
first
time
and
two
weeks
later
the
wedding
took
place
when
they
returned
as
bride
and
groom
the
settlers
came
from
every
direction
accompanied
by
all
the
cow
and
sheep
bells
tin
cans
and
old
horns
on
the
strip
for
a

they
came

till
morning
imbert
took
over
the
cedar
fork
ranch
and
store
that
little
trade
center
outside
the
reservation
gate
where
a
disheveled
group
of
landseekers
had
faced
a
new
dawn
rising
upon
the
strip
and
ida
mary
who
so
loved
the
land
came
at
last
to
make
it
her
permanent
home
steady
practical
and
resourceful
it
was
such
women
the
west
needed
the
sturdily
built
log
house
was
a
real
home
no
shack
rustic
we
would
call
it
now
with
four
rooms
and
a
porch
there
were
beds
carpets
and
linoleum
on
the
kitchen
floor
ida
mary
was
so
proud
of
the
linoleum
that
she
wiped
it
up
with
skim
milk
to
make
it
shine
there
was
a
milk
cow
and
consequently
homemade
butter
and
cottage
cheese
all
the
makeshift
discomforts
of
homesteading
replaced
by
the
solid
and
enduring
qualities
of
home
peace
home
happiness
for
ida
mary
and
ma
wagor
problems
were
solved
too
it
appeared
that
her
first
husband
had
left
her
more
than
the
brooch
of
which
she
was
so
proud
he
had
left
her
a
son
who
had
grown
to
be
a
stalwart
young
man
who
worked
with
a
construction
company
out
in
western
nebraska
learning
of
the
wagors
misfortune
he
came
started
another
store
at
ammons
for
his
mother
and
helped
her
to
run
it
for
a
while
all
around
ammons
the
fields
lay
freshly
turned
fallowing
for
next
year
crop
our
field
of
flax
had
been
cut
for
what
little
it
would
make
and
the
ground
plowed
over
to
soak
up
the
winter
moisture
with
the
turning
of
the
ground
for
another
season
a
page
in
my
own
life
was
turning
what
am
i
going
to
do
now
that
i
come
in
under
the
wire
i
wondered
and
then
i
proved
up
and
got
my
patent
i
borrowed
a
thousand
dollars
on
it
to
pay
off
the
government
and
the
balance
due
our
financial
backers
who
had
gambled
on
us
without
security
but
i
did
not
borrow
the
money
through
the
halbert
donovan
company
the
loan
had
been
promised
me
by
the
banks
many
months
before
we
had
borrowed
on
the
first
homestead
to
get
the
second
borrowed
to
the
limit
on
the
second
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
helping
to
run
the
reservation
we
now
had
both
farms
mortgaged
to
the
hilt
but
the
hay
alone
would
pay
the
interest
and
taxes
land
would
increase
in
value
i
was
alone
at
the
shack
now
with
the
newspaper
still
to
get
out
riding
across
the
plains
toward
the
claim
one
afternoon
i
heard
the
swift
staccato
clicking
of
type
as
it
fell
rapidly
in
the
stick
the
metallic
sound
carried
across
the
prairie
as
i
neared
the
shop
as
i
walked
in
i
saw
perched
on
the
high
stool
in
front
of
the
type
case
a
little
hoydenish
figure
with
flying
hair
myrtle
coombs
the
printer
this
do
look
right
to
me
she
remarked
reading
her
stick
as
i
came
in
but
a
good
printer
follows
copy
even
if
it
flies
out
of
the
window
myrtle
had
come
back
on
vacation
to
see
how
her
homestead
was
progressing
seeing
that
i
needed
help
she
unrolled
a
newspaper
bundle
and
hung
her
extra
dress
and
nightgown
on
a
nail
laid
a
comb
and
a
toothbrush
on
the
dressing
table
and
for
two
weeks
she
threw
out
the
paper
with
a
bang
about
this
time
the
régime
of
our
government
was
changing
out
of
the
west
from
which
we
had
had
only
sheep
and
cattle
there
were
coming
men
destined
to
be
leaders
in
the
affairs
of
the
country
as
men
had
risen
from
the
ranks
to
guide
the
destinies
of
the
colonies
so
men
appeared
from
the
west
to
shape
this
new
america
they
came
from
a
world
where
land
was
king
it
was
a
boundless
territory
a
large
section
of
it
which
was
once
marked
on
the
map
as
the
great
american
desert
had
been
left
untouched
a
dead
possession
and
a
problem
to
the
government
who
did
not
know
what
use
to
make
of
it
until
the
homesteaders
pushed
west
in
the
past
two
or
three
years
homesteaders
had
taken
up
claims
filing
on
more
than
acres
making
a
solid
coverage
of
square
miles
those
settlers
and
their
families
constituted
a
million
people
ahead
of
this
tidal
wave
in
the
steady
stream
of
immigration
thousands
of
other
settlers
had
moved
west
now
there
were
several
million
people
who
must
subsist
on
the
raw
lands
they
with
others
who
had
followed
the
homesteaders
were
dependent
upon
their
success
or
failure
to
make
the
western
prairie
produce
it
had
to
produce
the
west
was
the
nation
reserve
of
natural
resources
the
soil
was
to
produce
cereal
gold
huge
fields
of
wheat
bread
for
a
new
people
bread
at
last
for
a
world
at
war
so
the
public
lands
question
was
of
first
importance
there
must
be
new
land
laws
and
other
measures
enacted
for
these
people
it
was
a
gigantic
task
set
for
the
men
from
out
the
west
to
perform
but
already
they
had
begun
to
wield
an
influence
on
the
affairs
of
the
nation
one
heard
of
a
man
from
utah
with
the
name
of
smoot
who
came
from
a
class
of
solid
builders
he
was
bound
to
be
heard
more
of
in
the
future
people
said
and
there
appeared
in
congress
a
man
whose
indomitable
force
soon
became
recognized
as
something
to
contend
with
a
man
from
idaho
named
william
borah
two
other
westerners
had
already
become
statesmen
of
note
they
had
sprung
from
the
sagebrush
country
senator
francis
warren
and
congressman
frank
mondell
both
of
wyoming
senator
warren
devoted
a
lifetime
to
the
interests
of
the
west
congressman
mondell
as
speaker
of
the
house
and
chairman
of
the
public
lands
committee
was
an
influence
for
the
homestead
country
and
from
our
own
state
progressive
fearless
was
senator
peter
norbeck
the
frontier
is
big
but
news
travels
over
it
in
devious
ways
and
the
work
of
and
of
ida
mary
and
me
began
to
be
known
in
washington
my
editorial
fight
for
the
settlers
attracted
the
attention
of
these
officials
from
the
west
from
several
of
them
we
received
messages
commending
our
efforts
and
offering
assistance
in
any
feasible
way
i
also
received
communications
from
senator
warren
and
congressman
mondell
commenting
upon
my
comprehension
of
the
homestead
issue
i
was
asked
to
submit
the
problems
of
my
people
and
in
return
i
sought
information
from
them
small
things
those
frontier
newspapers
but
had
achieved
what
ida
mary
and
i
had
hoped
of
it
it
had
been
the
voice
of
the
people
a
voice
heard
across
the
prairie
across
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
across
the
continent
to
the
doors
of
congress
itself
its
protests
its
recommendations
were
weighed
at
last
by
the
men
best
able
to
help
the
men
and
women
on
the
strip
and
the
little
outlaw
printer
to
her
overwhelming
surprise
was
being
recognized
not
only
on
the
strip
but
beyond
it
as
an
authority
on
the
homesteading
project
and
a
champion
of
the
homesteaders
it
was
back
on
the
lookout
of
the
outlaw
printer
and
the
outlaw
horse
thieves
that
i
got
another
letter
from
senator
warren
asking
what
my
plans
were
for
the
future
and
whether
i
had
thought
of
carrying
my
work
farther
on
work
where
the
harvest
was
great
and
the
laborers
few
he
said
should
i
decide
to
go
on
into
new
fields
i
could
depend
upon
his
support
he
would
recommend
my
newspaper
as
an
official
one
there
would
be
many
opportunities
probably
government
posts
for
which
my
particular
knowledge
would
qualify
me
while
i
was
still
undetermined
as
to
what
to
do
after
my
work
on
the
proof
sheet
was
finished
i
was
not
a
career
woman
and
senator
suggestions
received
little
serious
thought
ida
mary
i
thought
was
serving
the
west
in
the
best
way
for
a
woman
needles
and
thread
and
bread
dough
have
done
more
toward
preserving
nations
than
bullets
and
the
women
who
made
homes
on
the
prairie
working
valiantly
with
the
meager
tools
at
their
command
did
more
than
any
other
group
in
settling
the
west
it
was
their
efforts
which
turned
shacks
into
livable
houses
their
determination
to
provide
their
children
with
opportunities
which
built
schools
and
established
communities
i
was
content
for
a
while
to
thrust
the
thought
of
the
future
out
of
my
mind
but
i
continued
to
watch
with
tense
interest
what
was
happening
to
the
homestead
country
a
new
land
law
had
been
passed
which
had
a
strong
influence
on
the
agricultural
development
of
the
west
it
doubled
the
size
of
homesteads
to
acres
this
would
bring
farmers
and
families
for
permanent
building
it
would
give
them
more
pasture
and
plenty
of
land
to
carry
on
the
fallowing
method
to
discourage
the
settler
it
required
three
years
a
certain
amount
of
fencing
and
eighty
acres
plowed
to
get
a
deed
it
created
a
new
land
splurge
a
to
the
average
homeseeker
it
was
like
owning
the
whole
frontier
this
law
was
called
the
mondell
act
and
president
theodore
roosevelt
proclaimed
it
a
great
opportunity
for
the
poor
people
and
a
long
stride
in
the
west
progress
roosevelt
had
faith
in
the
future
of
a
greater
america
the
programs
which
he
initiated
were
to
accomplish
tremendous
results
in
the
building
of
the
western
lands
with
my
bent
for
delving
into
the
effect
of
land
rulings
on
the
settler
i
made
inquiry
regarding
certain
provisions
of
the
mondell
act
with
the
information
came
a
letter
from
its
author
expressing
his
belief
in
the
advantages
of
the
act
to
the
homeseeker
and
describing
what
it
would
do
in
developing
the
territory
farther
west
he
talked
too
about
my
work
and
my
carrying
it
into
new
fields
wyoming
was
bound
to
become
a
homestead
mecca
and
he
added
your
experience
in
south
dakota
could
no
doubt
be
made
of
great
value
in
aiding
in
the
development
of
wyoming
a
few
days
after
i
received
congressman
mondell
letter
west
arrived
usually
placid
and
genial
he
was
now
wrought
up
he
came
at
once
to
the
point
of
his
visit
under
the
enlarged
homestead
law
he
was
extending
operations
farther
west
where
he
was
going
to
settle
large
tracts
he
wanted
me
to
head
bands
of
homeseekers
into
this
new
territory
to
help
colonize
it
we
were
entering
an
era
of
colonization
of
doing
things
in
organized
groups
cooperative
bodies
to
the
progress
which
these
movements
have
made
in
the
united
states
much
is
owing
to
the
west
where
it
was
developed
through
necessity
eastern
men
were
forming
corporations
to
colonize
western
land
real
estate
dealers
were
organizing
colonies
groups
of
homeseekers
were
organizing
their
own
bands
west
had
many
inquiries
from
such
groups
and
he
had
determined
to
do
his
own
colonizing
they
would
want
me
to
go
to
eastern
cities
he
said
bring
the
colonists
west
and
help
locate
them
satisfactorily
the
locating
fees
according
to
west
would
run
into
money
and
he
proposed
to
give
me
per
cent
of
the
profits
in
addition
he
promised
we
will
advance
you
a
fair
salary
and
all
expenses
i
realized
that
i
must
face
the
future
the
proof
business
on
the
strip
was
almost
over
henceforth
the
paper
and
the
post
office
which
had
been
transferred
to
me
on
ida
mary
marriage
would
eke
out
a
bare
existence
and
as
ma
wagor
complained
the
brulé
was
becoming
so
settled
it
would
be
havin
a
ladies
aid
before
long
with
the
women
servin
tea
and
carryin
callin
cards
around
that
would
be
no
place
for
me
for
a
long
time
i
sat
gazing
out
of
the
window
over
the
open
spaces
what
would
this
mean
to
the
people
whom
i
was
to
bring
west
it
was
they
not
i
nor
any
other
individual
whose
future
must
be
weighed
the
tidal
wave
of
western
immigration
would
reach
its
crest
in
the
next
two
or
three
years
and
break
over
wyoming
montana
colorado
those
states
bordering
the
great
divide
it
was
to
reach
its
high
peak
in
when
the
united
states
entered
the
world
war
i
remembered
the
shaking
hands
the
faces
of
the
men
and
women
who
had
lost
at
the
rosebud
drawing
there
was
still
land
for
them
land
of
their
own
for
tenant
farmers
land
for
the
homeless
the
land
of
a
million
shacks
that
was
the
slogan
of
the
frontier
where
is
this
land
i
asked
finally
in
wyoming
across
the
line
reaching
into
the
rawhide
country
west
explained
rawhide
country
lost
trail
a
range
but
rich
lone
star
had
said
an
country
all
creation
i
turned
to
west
and
faced
him
squarely
has
it
got
water
he
smiled
at
the
sudden
vehemence
of
the
question
and
was
ready
for
it
yes
it
has
water
the
finest
in
the
world
water
clear
and
cold
he
told
me
could
be
obtained
at
two
to
three
hundred
feet
on
almost
any
spot
out
on
the
scattered
ranches
in
the
middle
of
the
range
one
found
windmills
pumping
all
day
long
there
would
be
plenty
of
water
for
stock
and
for
irrigating
small
patches
all
right
i
said
i
go
the
cartoonist
was
going
back
to
milwaukee
being
here
has
done
something
for
me
he
said
seeing
so
much
effort
given
ungrudgingly
for
small
results
i
think
i
going
back
and
do
something
with
my
art
but
it
odd
i
do
really
want
to
go
back
one
by
one
the
settlers
had
left
the
country
but
huey
dunn
chris
christopherson
and
others
like
them
were
learning
to
meet
the
country
on
its
own
terms
and
conquer
it
they
were
there
to
stay
a
young
man
appeared
who
was
willing
to
run
the
newspaper
and
i
turned
the
post
office
over
to
ma
wagor
amid
the
weird
beating
of
and
the
of
the
indians
across
the
trail
i
set
up
my
farewell
message
in
in
gorgeous
regalia
of
beads
and
quills
paint
and
eagle
feathers
the
indians
had
come
to
send
the
great
spirit
with
on
to
the
heap
big
hunting
grounds
it
was
the
time
of
year
when
paint
in
all
the
variegated
colors
was
plentiful
gathered
from
herbs
and
flowers
yellow
copper
red
the
affair
was
probably
more
of
an
excuse
to
celebrate
than
an
expression
of
esteem
the
indians
never
miss
an
opportunity
to
stage
a
show
when
they
attend
a
county
fair
or
other
public
gathering
they
load
up
children
dogs
and
worldly
goods
and
in
a
long
procession
they
set
out
arriving
several
days
before
the
event
and
celebrating
long
after
it
is
all
over
they
had
come
prepared
to
camp
for
the
night
at
the
print
shop
going
through
special
incantations
for
the
occasion
but
now
they
were
whooping
it
up
around
the
campfire
i
was
dragged
into
the
dance
and
went
careening
around
with
old
warriors
and
young
bucks
the
squaws
laughing
at
my
mistakes
as
a
farewell
editorial
i
quoted
the
epitaph
once
engraved
on
a
tombstone
he
done
his
damnedest
angels
could
do
no
more
the
eerie
sound
of
the
indian
dance
had
ceased
the
flickering
campfires
had
died
down
only
two
years
and
four
months
since
ida
mary
and
i
had
broken
a
trail
to
that
first
little
homestead
shack
and
a
chapter
of
my
life
was
closed
beyond
in
the
dark
slept
men
and
women
who
had
endured
hardships
and
struggles
and
heavy
labor
who
had
plowed
up
the
virgin
soil
and
set
their
own
roots
deep
in
it
they
were
here
to
stay
in
those
two
years
they
had
built
a
little
empire
that
would
endure
there
were
roads
and
fences
schools
and
thriving
towns
nearby
where
they
could
market
their
products
and
during
the
world
war
presho
became
the
second
largest
point
in
the
united
states
with
the
government
buying
trainloads
of
the
fine
native
hay
from
the
tall
grass
country
of
the
brulé
but
my
work
on
the
strip
was
ended
big
as
the
venture
had
seemed
to
me
in
the
beginning
it
was
only
a
fraction
of
the
country
waiting
to
be
tamed
and
beyond
there
was
wyoming
all
creation
i
was
going
with
no
fixed
program
or
goal
after
the
settlers
were
on
the
ground
there
would
be
many
obstacles
which
must
be
overcome
down
to
earth
again
even
in
the
initial
colonizing
i
would
have
to
depend
on
my
own
initiative
on
my
influence
with
the
people
and
on
my
understanding
of
the
homestead
project
my
experience
on
the
brulé
in
getting
settlers
to
work
together
would
be
invaluable
the
field
would
be
new
but
the
principles
of
cooperative
effort
were
always
the
same
upon
learning
that
i
was
going
on
with
the
development
work
senator
warren
wrote
a
letter
filled
with
encouragement
and
information
and
senator
borah
expressed
his
interest
wyoming
exemplified
all
the
romance
the
color
the
drama
of
the
old
wild
west
it
was
noted
as
a
land
of
cowboys
wild
horses
and
fearless
men
as
a
commonwealth
it
was
invincible
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
sheep
and
cattle
kingdoms
in
the
world
where
stockmen
grazed
their
herds
over
government
domain
lords
of
all
they
surveyed
in
the
past
the
big
cattle
and
sheep
outfits
had
brooked
no
interference
one
of
the
worst
wars
ever
waged
had
been
fought
in
wyoming
against
an
invasion
of
homesteaders
a
war
that
became
so
bloody
the
government
had
to
take
a
hand
calling
out
the
national
guards
to
settle
it
it
was
this
section
of
the
range
country
that
i
was
to
help
fill
with
sodbreakers
the
force
of
progress
made
it
safer
now
with
the
government
and
public
sentiment
back
of
the
homestead
movement
these
wars
however
were
not
yet
a
thing
of
the
past
and
despite
the
years
of
western
development
that
followed
they
continued
to
break
out
every
now
and
then
in
remote
range
country
in
stockmen
of
various
sections
were
making
it
difficult
for
the
homesteader
and
it
was
certain
that
colonies
of
them
would
not
be
welcomed
with
open
arms
i
knew
all
this
in
a
general
way
of
course
but
i
had
no
trepidation
over
the
undertaking
my
only
qualms
were
on
the
score
of
health
it
is
a
poor
who
can
not
travel
with
strong
people
and
that
was
a
drawback
i
could
overcome
all
i
could
do
was
hope
for
the
best
and
rely
on
my
ability
to
catch
up
if
i
should
have
to
fall
behind
i
took
a
chance
on
it
i
rode
to
ida
mary
and
found
her
rocking
and
sewing
and
humming
to
herself
in
her
new
home
i
going
to
help
colonize
wyoming
i
told
her
bluntly
she
let
her
sewing
fall
to
the
floor
and
sat
staring
at
me
standing
bold
and
defiant
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
but
my
voice
broke
and
i
threw
myself
across
her
bed
crying
it
was
my
first
venture
without
ida
mary
she
did
not
say
now
as
she
had
done
on
other
occasions
how
can
you
help
colonize
a
raw
range
country
you
could
manage
it
life
had
done
something
to
us
out
here
i
started
out
from
ida
mary
out
across
the
plain
i
turned
and
looked
back
she
was
still
standing
in
the
doorway
shading
her
eyes
so
as
to
see
me
longer
we
waved
and
waved
and
i
left
her
watching
as
the
distance
swallowed
me
up
at
the
shack
i
found
judge
bartine
waiting
for
me
he
observed
the
traces
of
tears
on
my
cheeks
but
made
no
comment
on
them
you
know
he
said
i
glad
you
and
your
sister
stuck
through
all
this
i
hesitated
on
the
verge
of
telling
him
how
near
i
had
come
to
giving
up
and
starting
a
when
the
gang
i
convicted
burned
the
courthouse
and
my
office
over
my
head
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
i
made
a
narrow
escape
i
did
have
a
penny
in
the
world
left
with
which
to
fight
and
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
i
was
in
danger
of
being
shot
down
every
time
i
went
out
of
the
door
but
i
had
to
stay
men
could
go
through
hades
out
here
for
years
to
get
a
foothold
and
raise
a
herd
of
cattle
and
wake
up
one
morning
to
find
it
gone
something
had
to
be
done
with
those
cattle
thieves
it
seems
to
me
i
told
him
the
stockmen
should
have
paid
you
awfully
well
i
got
my
pay
he
said
quietly
just
as
you
have
done
i
got
my
pay
in
the
doing
so
edith
i
am
glad
you
girls
did
not
run
away
i
come
before
because
i
did
want
to
influence
you
i
wanted
to
see
you
do
it
alone
when
he
had
gone
i
closed
the
door
of
the
shack
behind
me
a
man
was
riding
up
the
trail
to
meet
me
bringing
two
messages
one
from
the
house
of
representatives
in
washington
was
signed
mondell
i
am
delighted
it
read
to
know
of
your
faith
and
confidence
in
the
country
farther
west
particularly
the
region
to
which
you
are
going
i
trust
the
settlers
whom
you
are
instrumental
in
bringing
into
the
country
will
be
successful
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
will
if
they
are
the
right
sort
i
wish
you
godspeed
and
success
the
other
letter
was
from
west
who
was
awaiting
me
on
the
road
to
wyoming
with
a
group
of
landseekers
on
top
of
the
ridge
i
stopped
and
gazed
at
the
cabin
with
no
sign
of
life
around
it
took
my
last
look
at
the
land
of
the
burnt
thigh
a
wilderness
i
had
found
it
a
thriving
community
i
left
it
but
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
i
had
new
trails
to
break
i
