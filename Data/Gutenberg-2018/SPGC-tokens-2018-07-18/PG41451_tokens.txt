i
dedicate
this
book
with
love
to
the
memory
of
my
grandfather
william
weld
whose
ships
sailed
upon
these
tropical
seas
foreword
it
is
my
hope
that
this
book
about
our
islands
in
the
pacific
ocean
may
be
of
some
interest
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
there
is
at
present
so
much
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
keep
the
philippines
soon
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
my
father
who
was
a
naval
officer
was
sent
on
a
cruise
on
the
pacific
and
stopped
for
a
time
both
at
honolulu
and
manila
during
this
cruise
he
took
part
in
the
occupation
and
survey
of
midway
island
as
it
is
now
called
first
possession
in
pacific
many
years
later
when
my
husband
and
i
started
on
our
first
trip
to
the
east
i
asked
my
father
if
he
would
give
us
letters
of
introduction
to
his
many
friends
there
he
replied
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
visited
the
islands
in
the
pacific
if
my
friends
have
forgotten
me
letters
would
do
no
good
and
if
they
remember
me
letters
are
not
necessary
needless
to
say
they
did
remember
him
and
extended
to
us
the
most
cordial
hospitality
the
charm
of
hawaii
will
linger
forever
in
our
memory
those
happy
flower
islands
where
the
air
is
sweet
with
perfume
and
gay
with
the
musical
strains
of
the
ukulele
we
lived
there
for
a
time
before
the
islands
were
annexed
to
the
united
states
and
on
another
visit
we
had
the
privilege
of
accompanying
the
secretary
of
war
hon
dickinson
so
that
we
had
exceptional
opportunities
of
seeing
both
hawaii
and
the
philippines
and
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
leaders
among
the
americans
and
the
natives
we
found
the
philippines
especially
fascinating
on
account
of
the
great
variety
they
provide
the
old
world
plazas
the
flowering
spanish
courtyards
and
the
pretty
women
in
their
distinctive
costume
of
piña
are
all
enchanting
nowhere
else
in
the
far
east
are
the
those
of
mixed
blood
socially
above
the
natives
the
filipinos
are
unique
in
that
they
are
the
only
asiatics
who
are
christians
among
the
hills
near
civilization
live
the
savages
who
indulge
in
the
exciting
game
of
the
moros
the
mohammedans
of
the
southern
islands
stand
quite
by
themselves
they
are
very
picturesque
and
absolutely
unlike
their
neighbours
secretary
dickinson
and
governor
forbes
we
can
never
thank
enough
for
the
thousand
and
one
strange
sights
we
saw
as
enchanting
as
the
tales
which
scheherezade
told
during
those
arabian
nights
i
only
wish
i
could
describe
them
in
her
delightful
style
of
all
the
spells
what
is
more
puissant
than
the
spell
of
the
tropics
the
singing
of
dripping
water
the
rustle
of
the
palm
in
the
breeze
in
this
land
you
forget
all
trouble
and
dream
of
love
and
happiness
while
the
southern
cross
gleams
brightly
in
the
sky
there
it
is
indeed
true
that
the
flower
of
love
has
leisure
for
growing
music
is
heard
in
the
evening
breeze
the
mountain
stream
laughs
loud
in
its
flowing
and
poesy
wakes
by
the
eastern
seas
i
wish
especially
to
say
how
grateful
i
am
to
those
who

chapter
i
the
bright
land
on
our
first
trip
to
hawaii
we
sailed
from
san
francisco
aboard
the
with
good
jolly
captain
finch
he
was
a
regular
old
tar
and
we
liked
him
we
little
thought
that
in
he
would
have
the
misfortune
to
be
in
command
of
the
when
it
was
torpedoed
in
the
atlantic
he
showed
great
gallantry
standing
on
the
bridge
and
going
down
with
his
ship
but
i
take
pleasure
in
adding
that
he
was
saved
we
had
an
ideal
ocean
voyage
calm
blue
seas
with
a
favouring
trade
wind
a
glorious
moon
and
strange
sights
of
huge
turtles
tropic
birds
and
lunar
rainbows
we
had
too
an
unusual
company
on
board
captain
gridley
of
manila
bay
fame
then
on
his
way
to
take
command
of
the
judge
widemann
a
german
who
had
lived
for
many
years
in
honolulu
and
had
married
a
hawaiian
princess
irwin
a
distinguished
american
with
a
japanese
wife
all
old
friends
of
my
father
who
as
a
naval
officer
made
several
cruises
in
the
pacific
furness
of
philadelphia
a
classmate
of
my
husband
at
harvard
who
was
going
out
to
study
the
of
borneo
and
castle
grandson
of
one
of
the
early
missionaries
to
hawaii
he
has
since
written
a
charming
book
on
the
islands
after
six
days
on
the
smooth
pacific
we
caught
sight
of
oahu
the
fairy
island
on
which
honolulu
is
situated
diamond
head
stretches
far
out
into
the
blue
like
a
huge
lizard
guarding
its
treasure
a
land
of
fruits
and
flowers
of
and
palm
the
first
view
across
the
bay
of
the
town
with
its
wreath
of
foliage
down
by
the
shore
just
as
the
golden
sun
was
setting
over
the
mountain
range
was
a
picture
to
be
remembered
and
in
the
distance
above
honolulu
the
extinct
crater
called
punchbowl
could
be
seen
out
of
which
the
gods
of
old
no
doubt
drank
and
made
merry
an
ancient
hawaiian
myth
of
the
creation
tells
how
wakea
the
beginning
married
papa
the
earth
and
they
lived
in
darkness
until
papa
produced
a
gourd
calabash
wakea
threw
its
cover
into
the
air
and
it
became
heaven
the
pulp
and
seeds
formed
the
sky
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
juice
was
the
rain
and
out
of
the
bowl
the
land
and
sea
were
created
this
country
they
lived
in
and
called
it
hawaii
the
bright
land
there
are
many
legends
told
of
papa
by
the
islanders
of
the
pacific
she
traveled
far
and
had
many
husbands
and
children
among
whom
were
the
father
of
winds
and
storms
and
the
father
of
forests
as
we
approached
the
dock
we
forgot
to
watch
the
frolicking
porpoises
and
the
silver
flying
fish
at
sight
of
the
daring
natives
on
their
boards
riding
the
surf
that
broke
over
the
coral
reef
the
only
familiar
face
we
saw
on
the
wharf
as
we
landed
was
george
carter
a
friend
of
my
husband
who
has
since
been
governor
of
the
islands
oahu
is
a
beautiful
island
and
the
town
of
honolulu
at
once
casts
its
spell
upon
you
with
the
luxuriance
of
its
tropical
gardens
there
is
the
spreading
poinciana
regia
a
tree
gorgeous
with
flowers
of
flame
colour
and
the
pride
of
india
with
delicate
mauve
blossoms
there
are
trees
with
streaming
yellow
clusters
called
golden
showers
and
superb
date
and
cocoanut
and
royal
palms
and
various
kinds
of
acacia
bougainvilleas
alamanders
and
bignonias
drape
verandas
and
cover
walls
there
are
hedges
of
hibiscus
and
cereus
and
masses
of
flowering
shrubs
everywhere
there
is
perfume
colour
and
profusion
the
greatest
wealth
of
vegetation
all
kept
in
the
most
perfect
freshness
by
constant
little
passing
showers
marvelous
rain
that
powders
one
without
wetting
him
honolulu
is
well
named
the
word
meaning
abundance
of
peace
for
we
found
the
gardens
of
the
town
filled
with
cooing
doves
it
is
said
the
place
was
called
after
a
chief
by
that
name
in
the
time
of
kakuhihewa
the
only
great
king
of
oahu
who
is
mentioned
before
kamehameha
i
at
the
time
of
this
visit
in
the
total
isolation
of
the
islands
was
impressive
absolutely
cut
off
as
they
were
except
for
steamers
sometimes
moreover
hawaii
was
three
weeks
without
an
arrival
so
that
the
coming
of
a
steamer
was
a
real
event
to
cable
home
one
had
to
send
the
message
by
a
ship
to
japan
and
so
on
around
the
world
after
a
night
at
the
old
royal
hawaiian
hotel
big
and
rambling
in
the
center
of
a
pretty
garden
we
started
housekeeping
for
ourselves
in
a
little
bungalow
on
the
hotel
grounds
with
a
chinaman
for
maid
of
all
work
here
we
lived
as
if
in
a
dream
reveling
in
the
beauty
of
land
and
sea
of
trees
and
flowers
enjoying
the
hospitality
for
which
the
islands
are
famous
and
exploring
as
far
as
we
could
some
of
the
enchanting
spots
of
this
heaven
on
earth
illustration
royal
hawaiian
hotel
we
were
pleased
with
our
little
house
with
its
wide
veranda
or
as
it
is
called
there
which
we
made
comfortable
and
pretty
with
long
wicker
chairs
and
chinese
lanterns
mangoes
falling
with
a
thump
to
the
ground
outside
and
lizards
and
all
sorts
of
harmless
creatures
crawling
or
flying
about
the
house
helped
to
carry
out
the
tropical
effect
in
the
four
visits
that
we
have
made
on
different
occasions
we
have
found
the
climate
perfect
the
temperature
averages
about
degrees
the
trade
winds
blowing
from
the
northeast
across
the
pacific
are
refreshing
as
well
as
the
tiny
showers
which
follow
you
up
and
down
the
streets
there
is
not
a
poisonous
vine
or
a
snake
or
any
other
creature
more
harmful
than
the
bee
but
i
must
confess
that
the
first
night
at
the
old
hotel
the
apparently
black
washstand
turned
white
on
my
approach
as
the
water
bugs
scuttled
away
nothing
really
troubled
us
but
the
mosquitoes
which
by
the
way
did
not
exist
there
in
the
early
days
so
must
have
been
taken
in
on
ships
the
islands
have
been
well
called
the
paradise
of
the
pacific
and
the
playground
of
the
world
the
five
largest
in
the
group
and
the
only
important
ones
are
hawaii
about
the
size
of
connecticut
maui
oahu
kauai
and
molokai
the
small
ones
are
not
worth
mentioning
as
they
have
only
cattle
and
sheep
and
a
few
herdsmen
upon
them
they
are
formed
of
lava
the
product
of
numberless
volcanic
eruptions
and
the
action
of
the
sea
and
the
rain
combined
with
the
warm
climate
and
the
moisture
brought
by
the
trade
winds
has
resulted
in
the
most
varied
and
fascinating
scenery
mark
twain
who
spent
many
months
there
said
of
them
they
are
the
loveliest
group
of
islands
that
ever
anchored
in
an
ocean
and
indeed
we
were
of
his
opinion
at
that
time
the
islands
formed
an
independent
republic
under
sanford
dole
as
president
the
son
of
rev
daniel
dole
one
of
the
early
missionaries
he
was
educated
at
punahou
meaning
new
spring
now
called
oahu
college
and
at
williams
college
in
the
states
he
came
to
boston
to
study
law
and
was
admitted
to
the
bar
but
hawaii
called
him
as
if
with
a
forecast
of
the
need
she
would
have
of
his
services
in
later
days
and
he
went
back
to
oahu
where
he
took
high
rank
among
the
lawyers
in
the
land
of
his
birth
and
became
judge
of
the
supreme
court
after
the
direct
line
of
kamehameha
sovereigns
became
extinct
and
the
rule
of
their
successors
culminated
in
the
attempt
of
queen
liliuokalani
to
restore
the
ancient
rites
and
also
to
turn
the
island
into
a
monte
carlo
judge
dole
was
the
one
man
who
understood
both
parties
and
had
the
confidence
of
both
and
he
was
the
unanimous
choice
of
the
best
element
of
the
population
for
president

b
dole
of
course
we
visited
the
buildings
and
localities
in
honolulu
that
were
of
interest
because
of
their
connection
with
the
existing
government
or
their
history
in
the
past
the
executive
building
the
old
palace
built
by
king
kalakaua
and
finished
in
the
finest
native
woods
and
the
court
house
which
was
the
government
building
in
the
days
of
the
kings
the
big
kawaiahao
church
built
of
coral
blocks
in
and
the
hospital
all
are
in
the
city
but
they
have
often
been
described
so
i
pass
them
by
with
only
this
mention
the
first
frame
house
ever
erected
in
the
islands
deserves
a
word
as
it
was
sent
out
from
boston
for
the
missionaries
it
had
two
stories
and
in
the
early
days
its
tiny
rooms
were
made
to
shelter
four
mission
families
and
native
children
who
were
their
pupils
oahu
college
too
interested
us
it
was
built
on
the
land
given
by
chief
boki
to
hiram
bingham
one
of
the
earliest
missionaries
who
donated
it
to
his
coworkers
as
a
site
for
a
school
for

children
the
buildings
stand
in
a
beautiful
park
of
ninety
acres
in
which
are
superb
royal
palms
and
the
finest
algaroba
trees
in
honolulu
long
ago
in
the
days
of
the
rush
for
gold
to
california
boys
were
sent
there
for
an
education
from
the
pacific
coast
the
great
aquarium
at
waikiki
the
bathing
suburb
of
honolulu
i
found
particularly
fascinating
there
does
not
exist
in
the
world
an
aquarium
with
fishes
more
peculiar
in
form
or
colouring
than
those
at
waikiki
unless
the
new
one
in
the
philippines
now
surpasses
it
about
five
hundred
varieties
of
fish
are
to
be
found
in
the
vicinity
of
the
islands
the
fish
are
of
many
curious
shapes
and
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
some
have
long
swordlike
noses
and
others
have
fins
on
their
backs
that
look
like
feathers
one
called
the
bridal
veil
has
a
lovely
filmy
appendage
trailing
through
the
water
the
unusual
shapes
of
the
bodies
the
extraordinary
eyes
and
the
fine
colouring
give
many
of
them
a
lively
and
comical
appearance
even
the
octopus
the
sea
creature
seemed
wide
awake
and
gazed
at
the
onlookers
through
his
glass
window
an
afternoon
was
spent
in
the
bishop
museum
which
is
very
fine
and
well
equipped
its
collection
covering
all
the
pacific
islands
i
was
chiefly
interested
in
the
hawaiian
curios
the
finely
woven
mats
of
grass
work
and
the
implements
of
the
old
days
here
too
was
the
famous
royal
cloak
of
orange
made
of
feathers
from
the
bird
it
was
a
work
of
prodigious
labour
covering
a
hundred
years
this
robe
is
one
of
the
most
gorgeous
things
i
have
ever
seen
and
is
valued
at
a
million
dollars
there
were
others
of
lemon
yellow
and
of
reds
besides
the
plumed
insignia
of
office
called
which
were
carried
before
the
king
our
guide
through
the
museum
was
the
curator
professor
brigham
who
had
made
it
the
greatest
institution
of
its
kind
in
the
world
this
museum
is
a
memorial
created
by
her
husband
to
bernice
pauahi
bishop
of
kamehameha
i
and
the
last
descendant
of
his
line
bernice
pauahi
was
the
daughter
of
the
high
chief
paki
and
the
high
chieftainess
konia
she
was
born
in
and
was
adopted
in
native
fashion
by
kinau
sister
of
kamehameha
iii
who
at
that
time
had
no
daughters
of
her
own
her
foster
sister
queen
liliuokalani
said
of
her
she
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
i
ever
saw
at
nineteen
she
married
an
american
hon
charles
bishop
who
was
collector
of
customs
in
honolulu
at
that
time
she
led
a
busy
life
and
used
her
ability
and
her
wealth
to
help
others
she
understood
not
only
her
own
race
but
also
foreigners
and
she
used
her
influence
in
bringing
about
a
good
understanding
between
them
in
the
year
before
her
death
she
bequeathed
her
fortune
to
found
the
kamehameha
school
for
hawaiian
boys
and
girls
this
school
has
now
a
fine
group
of
stone
buildings
not
far
from
honolulu
the
lunalilo
home
was
founded
by
the
king
of
that
name
for
aged
hawaiians
when
we
visited
it
we
were
particularly
interested
in
one
old
native
who
was
familiar
with
the
use
of
the
musical
instruments
this
man
named
keanonako
was
still
alive
two
years
ago
he
was
taught
by
his
grandfather
who
was
retained
by
one
of
the
old
chiefs
he
played
on
three
primitive
instruments
a
conch
shell
a
and
a
nose
flute
the
last
is
made
of
bamboo
and
is
open
at
one
end
with
three
perforations
the
thumb
of
the
left
hand
is
placed
against
the
left
nostril
closing
it
the
flute
is
held
like
a
clarinet
and
the
fingers
are
used
to
operate
it
keanonako
played
the
different
notes
of
the
birds
of
the
forest
and
really
gave
us
a
lovely
imitation
the
musical
instruments
in
use
are
the
guitar
the
mandolin
and
the
the
native
hawaiians
are
very
musical
and
sing
and
play
well
but
the
music
is
now
greatly
mixed
with
american
and
european
airs
it
was
always
entertaining
to
drive
in
the
park
where
we
listened
to
the
band
and
watched
the
women
on
horseback
in
those
days
the
native
women
rode
astride
wonderfully
well
and
looked
very
dignified
and
stately
but
one
does
not
see
this
superb
horsemanship
and
the
old
costumes
any
more
they
did
indeed
make
a
fine
appearance
with
the
long
flowing
scarfs
of
gay
colours
which
some
of
them
wore
floating
over
their
knees
and
almost
reaching
the
ground
while
their
horses
curvetted
and
pranced
one
of
the
amusements
was
to
go
down
to
the
dock
to
see
a
steamer
off
and
watch
the
pretty
custom
of
decorating
those
who
went
away
with
wreaths
of
flowers
which
were
placed
around
the
neck
till
the
travelers
looked
like
moving
bouquets
and
the
whole
ship
at
last
became
a
garden
when
large
steamers
sailed
the
whole
town
went
to
the
wharf
and
the
famous
royal
hawaiian
band
which
captain
berger
a
german
led
for
forty
years
played
native
airs
for
an
hour
before
the
time
of
sailing
it
was
an
animated
and
pretty
sight
at
the
dock
for
the
natives
are
so
fond
of
flowers
that
they
too
wear
leis
continually
as
bands
around
their
hats
and
they
bring
and
send
them
as
presents
and
in
compliment
steamers
arriving
at
the
port
were
welcomed
in
the
same
charming
fashion
judge
widemann
kindly
asked
us
to
dine
and
view
his
wonderful
hedge
of
cereus
the
good
old
judge
who
had
married
the
princess
had
three
daughters
two
of
the
girls
were
married
to
two
brothers
who
were
americans
all
the
daughters
were
attractive
and
the
youngest
who
was
the
wife
of
a
german
was
remarkably
pretty
it
was
strange
at
first
to
see
people
in
white
satin
dinner
gowns
and
to
find
them
so
cultured
and
charming
we
dined
with
and
castle
also
with
old
macfarlane
at
waikiki
we
enjoyed
our
evening
there
immensely
sam
parker
the
prince
of
the
natives
and
paul
neumann
and
wilder
too
all
great
characters
in
those
days
were
very
kind
to
us
many
of
them
have
passed
away
but
i
shall
always
remember
them
as
we
knew
them
in
those
happy
honeymoon
months
all
the
mystic
spell
of
those
tropical
evenings
at
waikiki
lives
in
these
lines
by
rupert
brooke
warm
perfumes
like
a
breath
from
vine
and
tree
drift
down
the
darkness
plangent
hidden
from
eyes
somewhere
an
eukaleli
thrills
and
cries
and
stabs
with
pain
the
night
brown
savagery
and
dark
scents
whisper
and
dim
waves
creep
to
me
gleam
like
a
woman
hair
stretch
out
and
rise
and
new
stars
burn
into
the
ancient
skies
over
the
murmurous
soft
hawaiian
sea
i
took
great
pleasure
in
going
to
governor
cleghorn
place
he
is
a
scotchman
who
married
a
sister
of
the
last
king
and
was
at
one
time
governor
of
this
island
many
years
ago
my
father
brought
home
a
photograph
of
their
beautiful
daughter
then
a
girl
of
fourteen
who
died
not
long
after
cleghorn
grounds
were
superb
old
avenues
of
palms
and
flowering
shrubs
and
shady
walks
with
japanese
bridges
and
pools
of
water
filled
with
lilies
a
fine
view
of
the
valley
opened
out
near
the
house
there
were
really
two
connected
houses
which
were
large
and
built
of
wood
with
verandas
one
huge
room
was
filled
with
portraits
of
the
hawaiian
royal
family
and
some
prints
of
queen
victoria
and
prince
albert
there
were
knickknacks
everywhere
and
tables
and
chairs
bowls
made
by
hand
and
primitive
stone
tools
we
were
served
with
lemonade
by
two
japanese
servants
in
the
pretty
costume
of
their
land
while
tea
was
served
by
a
picturesque
chinese
woman
at
a
table
on
the
veranda
besides
these
informal
entertainments
there
were
various
official
functions
one
was
a
delightful
musicale
at
president
dole
house
in
the
midst
of
his
lovely
tropical
garden
also
a
dinner
at
the
consul
general
besides
several
parties
on
the
naval
vessels
at
the
station
captain
book
gave
us
a
dinner
and
dance
on
his
ship
the
we
had
breakfast
one
day
on
the
flagship
with
admiral
and
beardsley
the
admiral
was
in
command
of
the
station
captain
cotton
of
the
also
gave
us
a
boating
party
by
moonlight
followed
by
a
little
dance
aboard
ship
illustration
after
lunching
with
the
american
minister
sewall
one
day
we
sat
on
his
lanai
at
waikiki
and
watched
the
which
was
most
exciting
even
from
a
distance
as
the
canoes
came
in
at
racehorse
speed
on
the
crest
of
the
breakers
that
day
and
i
put
our
bathing
suits
on
as
we
did
indeed
several
times
got
into
an
outrigger
canoe
with
two
native
boys
to
handle
it
and
started
for
the
reef
they
skilfully
paddled
the
boat
out
between
the
broken
waves
waiting
for
the
chance
to
move
on
without
meeting
a
foaming
crester
and
then
hurrying
to
catch
a
smooth
place
at
last
we
got
out
far
enough
and
turned
watching
over
our
shoulders
for
a
big
fellow
to
come
rolling
in
then
the
boys
paddled
wildly
and
allowed
the
crest
as
it
broke
to
catch
and
lift
the
boat
and
rush
it
along
on
top
of
the
roaring
foam
right
up
to
the
beach
on
one
of
our
trips
our
oarsmen
were
a
little
careless
and
we
were
upset
but
instead
of
swimming
in
shore
we
swam
out
to
sea
and
pushed
the
boat
until
we
were
well
beyond
the
breakers
where
we
could
right
it
again
and
get
in
which
for
those
not
used
to
it
is
not
a
particularly
easy
thing
to
accomplish
the
people
on
the
shore
became
frightened
about
us
and
sent
out
another
boat
to
pick
us
up
for
we
were
quite
far
out
and
there
were
many
sharks
around
by
the
way
one
hears
it
questioned
even
whether
sharks
really
do
eat
men
notwithstanding
two
men
were
bitten
lately
while
bathing
as
far
north
as
on
the
new
jersey
coast
i
will
simply
say
i
have
seen
a
black
diving
boy
at
aden
with
only
one
leg
as
the
other
was
bitten
off
by
a
shark
and
have
myself
even
worn
black
stockings
when
bathing
in
tropical
seas
because
it
is
said
sharks
prefer
white
legs
to
black
an
old
friend
of
mine
an
admiral
in
the
navy
tells
this
extraordinary
story
that
a
sailor
was
lost
overboard
from
his
ship
and
that
inside
a
shark
caught
the
very
same
day
was
found
the
sailor
head
here
is
another
story
even
more
remarkable
than
that
taken
from
musick
book
on
hawaii
why
sharks
are
the
most
tractable
creatures
in
the
world
when
you
know
how
to
handle
them
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
experience
and
skill
to
handle
a
shark
one
of
the
species
but
the
kanaka
boys
know
exactly
how
to
master
them
i
used
to
have
a
fish
pond
over
on
the
other
side
of
oahu
and
at
high
tide
sometimes
as
many
as
half
a
dozen
sharks
would
come
in
the
pond
at
a
time
and
when
it
was
low
tide
it
left
them
in
the
pond
which
would
be
so
shallow
the
sharks
could
not
turn
over
the
native
boys
used
to
go
to
that
pond
jump
astride
the
sharks
and
ride
them
through
the
water
it
was
great
amusement
to
see
them
riding
races
around
the
pond
on
the
backs
of
the
sharks
now
if
you
do
believe
this
story
if
you
will
charter
the
ship
i
will
take
the
whole
party
to
the
very
pond
in
which
the
sharks
are
ridden
for
horses
if
i
ca
show
you
the
pond
i
will
pay
the
expense
of
the
ship
a
long
drive
up
into
the
mountains
back
of
the
town
one
morning
took
us
to
mt
tantalus
two
thousand
or
more
feet
high
from
which
there
are
splendid
views
of
the
plain
below
and
the
sea
beyond
and
mountain
ranges
on
each
side
there
are
many
pretty
summer
villas
built
on
its
slopes
while
we
were
looking
down
on
the
town
and
harbour
far
below
us
we
saw
little
puffs
of
white
smoke
and
long
after
could
just
hear
the
booming
of
the
guns
of
the
warships
american
english
and
japanese
saluting
in
honour
of
the
president
of
this
little
island
republic
who
was
visiting
one
of
the
vessels
then
we
climbed
higher
yet
through
woods
of
trees
bordered
by
thickets
of
the
lantana
with
its
flowers
up
till
we
could
look
down
into
the
dead
crater
of
punchbowl
and
over
diamond
head
and
far
off
across
the
sparkling
ocean
while
the
steeply
ravined
and
ribbed
mountains
seemed
to
fall
away
suddenly
beneath
our
feet
punchbowl
where
in
the
early
days
the
natives
offered
human
sacrifices
is
for
the
most
part
as
red
as
clay
though
a
tinge
of
green
in
its
chinks
suggests
those
bronzes
of
uncertain
antiquity
on
this
mountain
top
a
myth
tells
us
how
a
human
being
was
first
made
a
man
to
rule
over
this
island
the
gods
molded
him
from
the
clay
of
the
crater
and
as
they
were
successful
and
he
came
to
life
they
made
from
his
shadow
a
woman
to
keep
him
company
indeed
many
of
the
natives
still
believe
in
gods
and
fairies
in
shark
men
owls
and
ghosts
and
they
will
tell
you
stories
of
the
goddess
of
the
crater
even
when
we
last
visited
this
island
thirteen
years
later
with
our
secretary
of
war
dickinson
we
saw
many
changes
we
were
taken
to
the
alexander
young
hotel
in
the
center
of
the
town
and
to
the
great
hotel
at
waikiki
the
old
hotel
where
we
stayed
years
before
had
changed
hands
and
was
sadly
run
down
how
pretty
and
green
everything
was
and
how
marvelous
were
the
flowers
many
new
and
rare
species
had
been
planted
the
changes
have
been
gradual
but
honolulu
is
a
modern
american
town
with
business
blocks
of
brick
the
makapuu
point
light
is
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
and
diamond
head
crater
has
been
made
into
one
of
the
strongest
fortifications
of
modern
times
great
are
to
be
seen
off
honolulu
and
pearl
harbour
has
been
dredged
the
army
quarters
on
this
island
are
quite
fine
there
are
good
golf
links
and
on
the
polo
field
you
see
excellent
players
the
field
is
also
used
for
aviation
the
finely
equipped
children
hospital
the
normal
school
and
the
mckinley
high
school
were
interesting
institutions
that
had
sprung
up
since
our
first
visit
out
of
a
total
population
in
all
the
islands
of
honolulu
has
over
many
new
houses
and
beautiful
gardens
are
to
be
seen
the
island
now
has
of
course
cable
and
wireless
communication
with
the
mainland
electric
cars
and
lights
telephones
the
telegraph
and
numberless
motors
in
fact
every
luxury
is
to
be
found
there
are
a
number
of
clubs
of
which
the
university
is
especially
popular
and
the
pacific
or
british
club
is
the
oldest
the
graduates
of
colleges
have
formed
a
club
of
their
own
schools
and
charitable
institutions
and
missionary
societies
are
numerous
and
the
building
is
very
prominent
the
city
now
has
many
churches
which
are
well
attended
the
episcopal
cathedral
of
stone
brought
from
england
is
especially
fine
the
catholic
cathedral
and
convent
have
long
been
established
it
was
a
catholic
priest
who
first
brought
the
algaroba
tree
from
central
america
sixty
years
ago
and
planted
it
in
the
city
of
honolulu
the
descendants
of
that
one
tree
have
reclaimed
great
sandy
wastes
and
clothed
them
with
fodder
for
cattle
our
motor
trip
to
pearl
harbour
took
us
past
damon
charming
new
place
with
its
delightful
japanese
garden
we
motored
to
the
pali
a
precipice
that
drops
one
thousand
feet
to
the
plains
which
stretch
to
the
sea
where
in
the
old
days
we
had
gone
so
often
now
a
stone
tablet
on
its
summit
bears
the
following
inscription
erected
by
the
daughters
of
hawaii
in
to
commemorate
the
battle
of
nuuanu
fought
in
this
valley
in
when
the
invading
kamehameha
i
drove
the

the
pali
and
hurled
them
over
the
precipice
thus
establishing
the
kamehameha
dynasty
in
these
days
of
aeroplanes
i
gather
this
myth
of
the
of
the
pali
from
legends
of
old
honolulu
by
westervelt
namaka
was
a
noted
man
of
kauai
but
he
left
that
island
to
find
some
one
whom
he
would
like
to
call
his
lord
he
excelled
in
boxing
leaping
and
flying
he
went
first
to
oahu
and
in
nuuanu
valley
he
met
pakuanui
a
very
skilful
boxer
and
they
prepared
for
a
contest
at
the
pali
pakuanui
could
not
handle
namaka
who
was
a
whirlwind
around
a
man
so
he
became
angry
and
planned
to
kill
him
namaka
was
as
slimy
as
a
fish
the
hill
of
the
forehead
he
struck
the
hill
of
the
nose
he
caught
like
a
rainbow
bending
over
the
he
was
as
he
circled
around
pakuanui
at
a
narrow
place
pakuanui
gave
him
a
kick
that
knocked
him
over
the
precipice
expecting
him
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
but
namaka
flew
away
from
the
edge
the
people
who
were
watching
said
he
flew
off
from
the
pali
like
an
io
bird
leaping
into
the
air
spreading
out
his
arms
like
wings
this
panorama
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
land
and
sea
coral
reef
and

green
meadow
and
shining
sand
spread
out
before
one
eyes
at
the

as
the
road
makes
a
sharp
turn
and
begins
to
descend
toward
the
valley
we
encounter
the
full
force
of
the
trade
winds
for
through
this
pass
a
gale
is
always
blowing
to
quote
from
charles
stoddard
if
you
open
your
mouth
too
wide
you
ca
shut
it
again
without
getting
under
the
lee
of
something
the
wind
blows
so
hard
from
the
pali
we
went
on
to
pearl
harbour
where
the
united
states
government
is
constructing
a
great
naval
station
this
harbour
the
finest
in
the
islands
is
a
deep
lagoon
entered
from
the
ocean
by
a
narrow
channel
three
miles
in
length
at
the
inner
end
it
expands
and
divides
into
two
lochs
which
are
from
thirty
to
sixty
feet
deep
and
with
a
shore
line
of
some
thirty
miles
algaroba
forests
cover
the
shores
and
the
fertile
countryside
in
which
are
rice
sugar
and
banana
plantations
promises
abundant
supplies
for
the
troops
stationed
here
pearl
harbour
has
really
been
in
our
possession
ever
since
the
reciprocity
treaty
with
hawaii
was
signed
in
administration
as
it
covers
ten
square
miles
the
whole
navy
of
this
country
could
find
anchorage
there
and
be
in
perfect
safety
not
only
has
the
bar
that
obstructed
the
entrance
to
the
channel
been
removed
the
long
narrow
channel
straightened
and
a
huge
drydock
constructed
in
which
our
largest
ships
of
war
could
be
repaired
but
barracks
repair
shops
a
power
house
hospitals
a
powder
magazine
and
all
the
other
buildings
needed
to
make
a
complete
station
have
been
erected
at
a
cost
of
more
than
ten
millions
of
dollars
before
the
drydock
was
finished
it
was
partially
destroyed
by
an
upheaval
the
natives
explanation
was
that
the
dock
was
built
over
the
home
of
the
and
that
he
resented
this
invasion
of
his
domain
the
island
of
oahu
will
soon
be
a
second
gibraltar
we
hope
the
channel
from
the
sea
is
guarded
by

a
hawaiian
feast
such
as
they
had
in
the
old
days
was
given
in
honour
of
the
secretary
of
war
so
we
were
taken
to
the
house
of
a
member
of
the
royal
family
i
was
surprised
to
see
how
fine
these
residences
were
this
man
was
only
part
native
and
really
one
would
not
have
suspected
from
his
appearance
that
he
had
any
hawaiian
blood
at
all
his
wife
was
a
fat
native
in
a
a
mother
hubbard
who
directed
the
feast
but
did
not
receive
the
bedroom
in
which
we
took
off
our
wraps
opened
out
of
the
big
ball
room
there
was
a
quilt
on
the
bed
and
on
the
walls
were
many
photographs
and
cheap
prints
here
were
also
royal
feather
plumes
in
vases
and
more
polished
poi
bowls
the
inclosure
where
we
feasted
or
had
the
or
bake
which
led
out
of
the
ball
room
was
half
open
with
a
cover
of
canvas
and
banana
leaves
it
contained
a
long
table
covered
with
flowers
and
fruit
bowls
and
small
dishes
there
were
no
forks
nor
spoons
nor
anything
but
fingers
to
eat
with
at
the
end
of
the
meal
a
wooden
dish
was
passed
for
us
to
wash
our
fingers
some
of
the
dishes
contained
raw
fish
with
a
sauce
a
cocoanut
shell
held
rock
salt
the
kind
that
is
given
to
cattle
and
a
small
bowl
was
filled
with
a
mixture
of
sweet
potato
and
cocoanut
that
was
the
best
dish
of
all
the
roasted
sweet
potato
was
good
too
and
pork
sewed
up
in
leaves
and
roasted
with
hot
stones
was
another
delicacy
the
drink
was
made
of
fruits
and
was
very
sweet
and
of
course
we
had
poi
illustration
poi
is
described
as
or
poi
thick
or
thin
native
hawaiians
like
it
a
few
days
old
when
it
is
sour
fortunately
as
this
was
only
one
day
old
i
was
able
to
put
one
of
the
pasty
stuff
in
my
mouth
and
on
a
dare
i
ventured
another
poi
is
made
from
the
taro
root
which
is
boiled
till
soft
then
pounded
and
mixed
with
water
why
i
was
not
ill
after
this
feast
i
do
know
as
i
tried
mangoes
grapes
watermelon
and
pineapple
as
well
as
all
the
other
things
leis
of
pink
carnations
were
put
about
our
necks
hawaiian
music
with
singing
went
on
during
the
meal
and
afterward
we
danced
the
company
was
certainly
cosmopolitan
one
of
the
people
who
interested
me
most
was
a
hawaiian
princess
really
very
pretty
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
her
father
was
english
another
interesting
person
was
the
daughter
of
a
chinaman
her
mother
being
half
hawaiian
her
husband
was
an
american
she
told
me
with
great
pride
that
her
boys
were
both
very
blond
a
wild
texan
army
man
also
roused
my
interest
from
the
point
of
view
of
character
study
and
i
must
not
forget
an
englishwoman
who
said
on
departure
us
is
going
now
we
found
it
all
very
diverting
and
the
people
so
kind
and
hospitable
that
we
enjoyed
every
minute
of
our
stay
chapter
ii
myths
and
meles
native
hawaiians
big
generous
happy
folk
athletic
and
fond
of
music
are
in
physical
characteristics
in
temperament
in
language
traditions
and
customs
so
closely
related
to
the
samoans
the
maoris
of
new
zealand
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
polynesia
that
it
is
clear
they
belong
to
the
same
race
although
hawaii
is
two
thousand
miles
from
any
other
land
the
people
are
so
much
like
the
natives
of
the
south
sea
islands
that
i
do
not
see
how
the
relationship
can
be
questioned
distance
too
means
little
for
we
hear
that
only
lately
a
japanese
junk
was
caught
in
a
storm
and
the
mast
destroyed
yet
it
was
swept
along
by
the
japan
current
and
in
an
exceedingly
short
time
was
washed
up
on
the
shore
near
vancouver
with
most
of
the
sailors
still
alive
the
adventurous
boatmen
who
first
landed
on
the
island
of
hawaii
however
must
not
only
have
crossed
two
thousand
miles
of
ocean
in
their
canoes
but
crossed
it
in
the
face
of
opposing
trade
winds
and
ocean
currents
the
polynesians
of
those
early
days
like
the
ancient
chaldeans
studied
the
heavenly
bodies
and
so
on
their
long
voyages
were
able
to
guide
their
course
by
the
stars
their
vessels
which
were
double
canoes
like
those
of
the
modern
samoans
were
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
feet
long
and
carried
a
large
company
of
people
with
provisions
animals
idols
and
everything
that
was
needed
for
a
long
voyage
or
for
colonizing
a
strange
island
the
legends
of
that
earliest
time
tell
of
who
sailed
from
the
west
to
the
islands
which
he
named
for
himself
the
coming
of
wakea
and
papa
also
belonged
to
that
period
while
they
are
mentioned
as
the
creators
of
the
earth
they
are
said
in
another
version
of
the
story
to
have
come
from
savaii
in
samoa
they
brought
with
them
the
which
is
common
to
all
polynesia
little
is
to
be
learned
however
of
the
history
of
hawaii
from
the
folklore
of
pacific
islanders
until
about
the
year
if
we
may
believe
their
traditions
this
was
a
time
of
great
restlessness
throughout
all
polynesia
when
hawaii
was
again
visited
and
held
communication
with
other
islands
peopled
by
the
same
race
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
this
was
the
century
when
the
norsemen
were
striking
out
across
the
atlantic
showing
that
there
were
daring
navigators
on
both
sides
of
the
globe
paao
one
of
the
heroes
from
samoa
who
settled
in
hawaii
became
high
priest
he
introduced
the
worship
of
new
gods
and
increased
the
number
of
tabus
the
great
temple
built
by
him
was
the
first
in
the
shape
of
a
quadrangle
previously
they
had
been
afterward
he
went
back
to
samoa
and
returned
with
pili
whom
he
made
ruler
and
from
whom
the
kamehamehas
were
descended
from
the
hawaiian
or
songs
we
may
picture
their
life
the
men
were
skilful
fishermen
using
hooks
of
shell
bone
or
tortoise
shell
nets
of
or
long
spears
of
hard
wood
the
bait
used
in
shark
fishing
was
human
flesh
when
it
was
thrown
into
the
water
and
the
shark
was
attracted
to
it
the
fishermen
sprang
overboard
and
fought
the
fish
with
knives
of
stone
and
sharp
shark
teeth
no
doubt
it
was
an
extremely
exciting
sport
along
the
shores
of
the
islands
are
the
walls
of
many
some
of
which
though
very
old
are
still
in
use
and
bid
fair
to
last
for
centuries
longer
usually
they
were
made
by
building
a
wall
of
lava
rock
across
the
entrance
to
a
small
bay
and
the
fish
were
kept
in
the
inclosure
the
wall
was
built
loosely
enough
to
allow
the
water
to
percolate
through
it
and
sluice
gates
were
added
which
could
be
opened
and
closed
they
were
at
first
owned
by
kings
and
chiefs
and
were
probably
built
by
the
forced
labour
of
the
people
tradition
has
it
that
the
wall
of
wekolo
pond
at
pearl
harbour
was
built
by
natives
who
formed
a
line
from
shore
to
mountain
and
passed
lava
rock
from
hand
to
hand
until
it
reached
the
shores
over
a
mile
away
without
once
touching
the
ground
some
of
the
ponds
in
the
interior
of
the
islands
have
been
turned
into
rice
fields
and
taro
patches
especially
on
oahu
the
sports
and
games
of
the
hawaiians
of
which
there
were
many
were
nearly
all
associated
with
gambling
indeed
it
was
the
betting
that
furnished
most
of
the
excitement
connected
with
them
at
the
end
of
a
day
of
games
many
of
the
people
would
have
staked
and
lost
everything
they
owned
in
the
world
boxing
and
hurling
the
a
circular
stone
disk
three
or
four
inches
in
diameter
were
some
of
the
favourite
amusements
as
well
as
tobogganing
which
is
interesting
as
a
tropical
adaptation
of
something
that
we
consider
a
northern
sport
the
slide
was
laid
out
on
a
steep
hillside
that
was
made
slippery
with
dry
grass
the
sled
of
two
long
narrow
strips
of
wood
joined
together
by
wicker
work
was
on
runners
from
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
long
and
was
more
like
our
sleds
than
modern
toboggans
the
native
held
the
sled
by
the
middle
with
both
hands
and
ran
to
get
a
start
then
throwing
himself
face
downward
he
flew
down
the
hill
out
upon
the
plain
beyond
sometimes
to
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
or
more

interior

the
old
hawaiians
were
not
bad
farmers
indeed
i
think
we
may
call
them
very
good
farmers
when
we
consider
that
they
had
no
metal
tools
of
any
description
and
most
of
their
agricultural
work
was
done
with
the
which
was
only
a
stick
of
hard
wood
either
pointed
at
one
end
or
shaped
like
a
rude
spade
with
such
primitive
implements
they
terraced
their
fields
irrigated
the
soil
and
raised
crops
of
taro
bananas
yams
sweet
potatoes
and
most
of
the
houses
of
primitive
hawaiians
were
small
but
the
grass
houses
of
the
chiefs
were
sometimes
seventy
feet
long
they
were
all
simply
a
framework
of
poles
thatched
with
leaves
or
the
long
grass
of
the
islands
inside
the
few
rude
belongings
mats
calabashes
gourds
and
baskets
for
fish
were
all
in
strange
contrast
to
the
modern
luxury
which
many
of
their
descendants
enjoy
the
cooking
was
done
entirely
by
the
men
in
underground
ovens
stones
were
heated
in
these
the
food
wrapped
in
ti
leaves
was
laid
on
the
stones
and
covered
with
a
layer
of
grass
and
dirt
then
water
was
poured
in
through
a
small
opening
to
steam
the
food
the
mild
climate
of
hawaii
makes
very
little
clothing
necessary
for
warmth
and
before
the
advent
of
the
missionaries
the
women
wore
only
a
short
skirt
of
that
reached
just
below
the
knees
and
the
men
a
the
tapa
a
sort
of
papery
cloth
is
made
from
the
bark
of
the
paper
mulberry
hawaiians
say
that
in
the
earliest
days
their
forefathers
had
only
coverings
made
of
long
leaves
or
braided
strips
of
grass
until
two
of
the
great
gods
kane
and
kanaloa
took
pity
upon
them
and
taught
them
to
make
or
shoulder
capes
tapa
making
was
an
important
part
of
the
work
of
the
women
it
was
sometimes
brilliantly
coloured
with
vegetable
dyes
and
a
pattern
put
on
with
a
bamboo
stamp
unlike
the
patterns
which
our
indians
wove
into
their
baskets
and
blankets
each
one
of
which
had
its
meaning
these
figures
on
the
tapa
had
no
special
significance
so
far
as
is
known
by
lapping
strips
of
bark
over
each
other
and
beating
them
together
the
tapa
could
be
made
of
any
desired
size
or
thickness
in
the
old
legends
hina
the
mother
of
the
maui
figures
as
the
chief
tapa
maker
the
clouds
are
her
tapas
in
the
sky
on
which
she
places
stones
to
hold
them
down
when
the
winds
drive
the
clouds
before
them
loud
peals
of
thunder
are
the
noise
of
the
rolling
stones
when
hina
folds
up
her
clouds
the
gleams
of
sunlight
upon
them
are
seen
by
men
and
called
the
lightning
the
sound
of
the
tapa
beating
was
often
heard
in
the
islands
the
story
is
told
that
the
women
scattered
through
the
different
valleys
devised
a
code
of
signals
in
the
strokes
and
rests
of
the
mallets
by
which
they
sent
all
sorts
of
messages
to
one
another
a
sort
of
primitive
telegraphy
that
must
have
been
a
great
comfort
and
amusement
to
lonely
women
in
the
early
days
marriage
and
family
associations
fell
lightly
on
their
shoulders
and
even
they
are
somewhat
lax
in
their
morals
the
seamen
who
visited
the
islands
after
their
discovery
by
captain
cook
brought
corruption
with
them
so
that
the
condition
of
the
natives
when
the
first
missionary
arrived
was
indescribable
a
great
lack
of
family
affection
perhaps
naturally
followed
from
this
light
esteem
of
marriage
the
adoption
and
even
giving
away
of
children
was
the
commonest
thing
even
among
the
high
chiefs
and
kings
and
exists
more
or
less
there
were
three
distinctly
marked
classes
even
among
the
ancient
hawaiians
chiefs
priests
and
common
people
proving
that
social
distinctions
do
not
entirely
depend
upon
civilization
the
chief
was
believed
to
be
descended
from
the
gods
and
after
death
was
worshiped
as
a
deity
the
priestly
class
also
included
sorcerers
and
doctors
all
called
and
were
much
like
the
medicine
men
among
the
american
indians
as
with
most
primitive
peoples
for
after
all
when
compared
they
have
very
similar
tastes
and
customs
diseases
were
supposed
to
be
caused
by
evil
spirits
and
the
kahuna
was
credited
with
the
power
to
expel
them
or
even
to
install
them
in
a
human
body
the
masses
had
implicit
belief
in
this
power
and
praying
to
death
was
often
heard
of
in
the
old
days
ancient
hawaiians
wrapped
their
dead
in
tapa
with
fragrant
herbs
such
as
the
flowers
of
which
had
the
property
of
embalming
them
they
were
sometimes
buried
in
their
houses
or
in
grottoes
dug
in
the
solid
rock
but
more
frequently
in
natural
caves
where
the
bodies
were
dried
and
became
like
mummies
sometimes
the
remains
were
thrown
into
the
boiling
lava
of
a
volcano

a
sacrifice

it
is
said
no
hawaiians
were
ever
cannibals
but
in
the
early
days
from
the
south
visited
these
islands
and
cooked
their
victims
in
the
ovens
of
the
natives
human
bones
made
into
the
shape
of
fish
hooks
were
thought
to
bring
luck
especially
those
of
high
chiefs
so
as
only
part
of
captain
cook
body
was
found
and
he
was
considered
a
god
perhaps
his
bones
were
used
in
this
way
the
or
temples
developed
from
paao
time
into
stone
platforms
inclosed
by
walls

stone
within
this
inclosure
were
sacred
houses
for
the
king
and
the
priests

the

which
was
a
tall
tower

stood

the
most
important
heiaus
which
still
exists
although
in
ruins
is
the
temple
of
wahaula
on
the
island
of
hawaii
there
was
much
that
was
hard
and
cruel
about
this
religion
the
idols
were
made
hideous
that
they
might
strike
terror
to
the
worshipers
human
sacrifices
were
offered
at
times
to
the
chief
gods
the
idols
of
the
natives
were
much
like
those
of
the
north
american
indians
but
the
kanakas
are
not
like
the
indians
in
character
the
oppressive
tabu
was
part
of
the
religion
and
the
penalty
for
breaking
it
was
death
the
word
means
prohibited
and
the
system
was
a
set
of
rules
made
by
the
chiefs
and
high
priests
which
forbade
certain
things
for
instance
it
was
tabu
for
women
to
eat
with
men
or
enter
the
men
eating
house
or
to
eat
pork
turtles
cocoanuts
bananas
and
some
kinds
of
fish
there
were
many
tabu
periods
when
no
canoe
could
be
launched
no
fire
lighted
no
tapa
beaten
or
poi
pounded
and
no
sound
could
be
uttered
on
pain
of
death
when
even
the
dogs
had
to
be
muzzled
and
the
fowls
were
shut
up
in
calabashes
for
hours
at
a
time
besides
the
religious
tabus
there
were
civil
ones
which
could
be
imposed
at
any
time
at
the
caprice
of
king
or
chiefs
who
would
often
forbid
the
people
to
have
certain
things
because
they
wished
to
keep
them
for
themselves
one
is
apt
to
think
that
in
those
early
days
the
natives
of
these
heavenly
islands
must
have
been
happy
and
without
laws
and
doing
as
they
wished
with
plenty
of
fruit
and
fish
to
eat
but
it
was
not
so
at
all
for
they
were
obliged
to
crawl
in
the
dust
before
their
king
they
were
killed
if
they
even
crossed
his
shadow
as
a
pleasant
contrast
to
all
these
grim
features
the
hawaiians
like
the
ancient
israelites
had
cities
of
refuge
of
which
there
were
two
on
the
island
of
hawaii
here
the
murderer
was
safe
from
the
avenger
the
was
secure
from
the
penalty
of
death
and
in
time
of
war
old
men
and
women
and
children
could
dwell
in
peace
within
these
walls
the
curious
belief
in
a
second
soul
or
double
and
in
ghosts
the
doctrines
of
a
future
state
and
the
peculiar
funeral
rites
all
of
which
formed
part
of
the
native
religion
seem
strange
to
many
christian
hawaiians
in
all
polynesia
the
four
great
gods
were
kane
father
of
men
and
founder
of
the
world
kanaloa
his
brother
ku
the
cruel
one
and
lono
to
whom
the
new
year
games
were
sacred
these
four
were
also
the
chief
deities
of
hawaiians
besides
the
great
gods
there
was
a
host
of
inferior
deities
such
as
the
god
of
the
sea
the
god
of
the
fishermen
the
shark
god
the
goddess
of
the
tapa
beaters
laka
the
goddess
of
song
and
dance
who
was
very
popular
and
pele
the
goddess
of
volcanoes
still
lower
in
the
scale
were
the
and
magicians
of
marvelous
power
like
maui
for
whom
the
island
of
maui
is
said
to
be
named
who
pulled
new
zealand
out
of
the
sea
with
his
magic
fish
hook
and
stole
the
secret
of
making
fire
from
the
wise
mud
hens
his
greatest
achievement
was
that
of
lassoing
the
sun
and
forcing
him
to
slacken
his
speed
he
was
a
hero
throughout
polynesia
and
his
hook
is
said
to
have
been
still
preserved
on
the
island
of
tonga
in
the
eighteenth
century
like
most
primitive
peoples
the
hawaiians
danced
in
order
that
their
gods
might
smile
upon
them
and
bring
them
luck
or
to
appease
the
dreaded
pele
and
the
other
gods
of
evil

of
began
in
this
way
as
a
sacred
dance
before
the
altar
in
a
temple
inclosure
while
the
girls
clad
in
skirts
of
grass
and
wreaths
of
flowers
chanted
their
songs
there
was
grace
in
some
of
the
movements
but
on
the
whole
the
dances
are
said
to
have
been
indescribably
lascivious
after
the
missionaries
arrived
the
hula
was
modified
and
it
has
almost
died
out

some
concession
in

many
of
the
old
chants
were
addressed
to
laka
sometimes
called
the
goddess
of
the
wildwood
growths
these
meles
had
neither
rime
nor
meter
and
were
more
like
chants
or
recitatives
as
the
singers
used
only
two
or
three
tones

enough

verses
suggest
the
modern

chants
include
love

composed

to
tell
the

besides

the
hawaiian

i
find
are
not
nearly
so
original
or
so
full
of
charm
as
the
japanese
and
chinese
stories
and
the
long
names
are
tiresome
they
have
moreover
lost
their
freshness
their
individuality
and
their
primitive
quality
in
translation
and
through
american
influence
they
had
been
handed
down
entirely
by
word
of
mouth
until
the
missionaries
arrived
many
of
the
myths
bear
some
resemblance
to
old
testament
stories
as
well
as
to
the
traditions
told
by
the
of
the
philippines
the
legends
of
the
volcano
seem
more
distinctly
hawaiian
there
are
many
legends
of
pele
as
well
as
chants
in
her
honour
which
generally
represent
her
as
wreaking
her
vengeance
on
mortals
who
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
offend
her
i
quote
one
that
is
told
to
account
for
the
origin
of
a
stream
of
unusually
black
lava
which
long
long
ago
flowed
down
to
the
coast
on
maui
a
withered
old
woman
stopped
to
ask
food
and
hospitality
at
the
house
of
a
dweller
on
this
promontory
noted
for
his
penuriousness
his
taro
patches
flourished
cocoanuts
and
bananas
shaded
his
hut
nature
was
lavish
of
her
wealth
all
around
him
but
the
withered
hag
was
sent
away
unfed
and
as
she
turned
her
back
on
the
man
she
said
will
return
this
was
pele
goddess
of
the
volcano
and
she
kept
her
word
and
came
back
the
next
day
in
earthquakes
and
thunderings
rent
the
mountain
and
blotted
out
every
trace
of
the
man
and
his
dwelling
with
a
flood
of
fire
another
story
goes
that
in
the
form
of
a
maiden
the
goddess
appeared
to
a
young
chief
at
the
head
of
a
toboggan
slide
and
asked
for
a
ride
on
his
sled
he
refused
her
and
started
down
without
her
soon
hearing
a
roar
as
of
thunder
and
looking
back
he
saw
a
lava
torrent
chasing
him
and
bearing
on
its
highest
wave
the
maiden
whom
he
then
knew
to
be
the
goddess
pele
down
the
hill
and
across
the
plain
his
toboggan
shot
followed
by
the
flaming
river
of
molten
rock
the
chief
however
reached
the
ocean
at
last
and
found
safety
in
the
waters
this
condensed
story
of
the
shark
king
is
also
a
typical
hawaiian
tale
the
king
shark
while
sporting
in
the
water
watched
a
beautiful
maiden
diving
into
a
pool
and
fell
in
love
with
her
as
king
sharks
can
evidently
take
whatever
form
they
please
he
turned
himself
into
a
handsome
man
and
waited
for
her
on
the
rocks
here
the
maiden
came
one
day
to
seek
shellfish
which
she
was
fond
of
eating
while
she
was
gathering
them
a
huge
wave
swept
her
off
her
feet
and
the
handsome
shark
man
saved
her
life
as
a
matter
of
course
she
straightway
fell
in
love
with
him
so
it
happened
that
one
day
they
were
married
but
it
was
only
when
her
child
was
born
that
the
shark
man
confided
to
her
who
he
really
was
and
that
he
must
now
disappear
as
he
left
he
cautioned
her
never
to
give
their
child
any
meat
or
misfortune
would
follow
the
child
was
a
fine
boy
and
was
quite
like
other
children
except
that
he
bore
on
his
back
the
mark
of
the
great
mouth
of
the
shark
as
he
grew
older
he
ate
with
the
men
instead
of
the
women
as
was
the
custom
and
his
grandfather
not
heeding
the
warning
but
wishing
to
make
his
grandson
strong
so
that
some
day
he
might
become
a
chief
gave
him
the
forbidden
meat
when
in
company
the
boy
wore
a
cape
to
cover
the
scar
on
his
back
and
he
always
went
swimming
alone
but
when
in
the
water
he
remembered
his
father
and
it
was
then
that
he
would
turn
into
a
shark
himself
the
more
meat
the
boy
ate
the
more
he
wanted
and
in
time
it
was
noticed
that
children
began
to
disappear
they
would
go
in
bathing
and
never
return
the
people
became
suspicious
and
one
day
they
tore
the
boy
mantle
off
him
and
saw
the
shark
mouth
upon
his
back
there
was
great
consternation
and
at
last
he
was
ordered
to
be
burned
alive
he
had
been
bound
with
ropes
and
was
waiting
for
the
end
but
while
the
fire
was
kindling
he
called
on
his
father
king
shark
for
help
and
so
it
was
that
he
was
able
to
burst
the
ropes
and
rush
into
the
water
where
he
turned
into
a
shark
and
escaped
the
mother
then
confessed
that
she
had
married
the
shark
king
the
chiefs
and
the
high
priests
held
a
council
and
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
offer
sacrifices
to
appease
him
rather
than
to
kill
the
mother
this
they
did
and
for
that
reason
king
shark
promised
that
his
son
should
leave
the
shores
of
the
island
of
hawaii
forever
it
was
true
he
did
leave
this
island
but
he
visited
other
islands
and
continued
his
bad
habits
until
one
day
he
was
really
caught
just
as
he
was
turning
from
a
man
into
a
shark
on
the
beach
in
shallow
water
he
was
bound
and
hauled
up
a
canyon
where
they
built
a
fire
from
the
bamboo
of
the
sacred
grove
but
the
shark
was
so
large
that
they
had
to
chop
down
one
tree
after
another
for
his
funeral
pyre
until
the
sacred
grove
had
almost
disappeared
this
so
angered
the
god
of
the
forest
that
he
changed
the
variety
of
bamboo
in
this
region
it
is
no
longer
like
other
bamboo
on
the
islands
chapter
iii
the
five
kamehamehas
hawaiian
myths
and
traditions
are
confused
and
unreliable
and
we
know
little
real
history
of
the
bright
land
the
land
of
rainbows
before
the
coming
of
captain
cook
in
we
do
know
however
that
in
those
early
days
the
different
tribes
continually
carried
on
a
savage
warfare
among
themselves
not
until
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
did
there
arise
a
native
chieftain
powerful
enough
to
subdue
all
the
islands
under
his
sway
and
bring
peace
among
the
warring
tribes
this
chief
was
kamehameha
i
or
kamehameha
the
great
often
called
the
napoleon
of
the
pacific
the
authentic
history
of
hawaii
really
begins
with
his
reign
his
portrait
in
the
executive
building
in
honolulu
shows
him
as
a
stern
warrior
the
japanese
as
well
as
the
spaniards
had
long
known
of
the
existence
of
islands
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
tradition
tells
of
some
shipwrecked
spanish
sailors
and
some
japanese
who
settled
there
at
a
very
early
date
these
islands
were
however
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
civilized
world
for
the
first
time
by
captain
cook
the
englishmen
were
received
by
the
simple
natives
with
awe
and
wonder
captain
cook
himself
was
declared
by
the
priests
to
be
an
incarnation
of
lono
god
of
the
forest
and
husband
of
the
goddess
laka
and
abundant
provisions
were
brought
to
the
ship
as
an
offering
to
this
deity
had
the
natives
been
even
decently
treated
there
would
have
been
no
tragic
sequel
to
the
story
but
cook
crew
were
allowed
complete
and
unrestrained
license
on
shore
as
it
was
there
was
no
serious
trouble
during
their
first
visit
but
when
they
returned
in
a
few
months
and
again
exacted
contributions
the
supplies
were
given
grudgingly
the
english
vessel
sailed
away
but
was
unfortunately
obliged
to
put
back
for
repairs
and
it
was
then
that
the
fight
occurred
between
the
foreigners
and
the
natives
in
which
captain
cook
met
his
death
it
was
this
famous
voyager
who
gave
the
name
of
sandwich
islands
to
the
group
in
honour
of
his
patron
lord
sandwich
they
were
known
by
that
name
for
many
years
but
it
was
never
the
official
designation
and
is
now
seldom
used
the
discovery
of
the
islands
by
englishmen
and
americans
was
fraught
with
evil
consequences
to
the
natives
as
they
brought
with
them
new
diseases
and
they
also
introduced
intoxicating
liquors
and
it
soon
became
the
custom
for
whaling
vessels
in
the
pacific
to
call
there
and
make
them
the
scene
of
debauchery
and
licentiousness
it
has
been
said
that
at
that
time
sea
captains
recognized
no
laws
either
of
god
or
man
west
of
cape
horn
we
must
not
fail
to
note
however
that
even
in
those
early
days
there
were
a
few
white
men
who
really
sought
the
good
of
the
hawaiians
isaac
davis
and
john
young
were
two
of
these
men
when
the
crew
of
an
american
vessel
was
massacred
these
two
were
spared
and
they
continued
to
live
in
the
islands
until
their
death
they
were
a
bright
contrast
to
most
seamen
who
visited
hawaii
at
that
period
they
accepted
the
responsibility
imposed
by
their
training
in
civilization
exerting
a
great
influence
for
good
and
were
even
advisers
and
teachers
of
king
kamehameha
captain
george
vancouver
who
visited
the
islands
three
times
in
the
last
decade
of
the
eighteenth
century
under
commission
from
the
british
government
was
another
white
man
whose
work
there
was
wholly
good
he
landed
the
first
sheep
and
cattle
ever
seen
there
and
induced
the
king
to
proclaim
them
tabu
for
ten
years
so
that
they
might
have
time
to
increase
after
which
women
were
to
be
allowed
to
eat
them
as
well
as
men
he
introduced
some
valuable
plants
such
as
the
grapevine
the
orange
and
the
almond
and
brought
the
people
seeds
of
garden
vegetables
he
refused
them
firearms
under
his
direction
the
first
sailing
vessel
was
built
there
and
called
the
vancouver
so
won
over
the
natives
by
his
kind
treatment
that
the
chiefs
ceded
the
islands
to
great
britain
and
raised
the
british
flag
in
february
he
left
them
with
a
promise
to
come
again
and
bring
them
teachers
of
christianity
and
the
industries
of
civilization
his
death
however
prevented
his
return
and
great
britain
never
took
formal
possession
kamehameha
i
who
at
the
time
of
cook
arrival
was
only
a
chief
on
the
island
of
hawaii
joined
in
the
tribal
wars
conquered
the
other
chiefs
of
that
island
and
became
king
while
this
conquest
was
in
progress
an
eruption
of
kilauea
destroyed
a
large
part
of
the
opposing
army
and
convinced
kamehameha
that
pele
was
on
his
side
the
subjugation
of
maui
and
oahu
followed
at
the
great
battle
fought
in
the
nuuanu
valley
the
king
of
oahu
was
defeated
and
driven
with
his
army
over
the
pali
kamehameha
was
twice
prevented
from
invading
kauai
but
some
years
later
it
was
ceded
to
him
by
its
ruler
after
the
conquest
of
oahu
was
completed
in
it
was
work
to
build
up
a
strong
central
government
according
to
the
feudal
system
that
had
existed
in
the
islands
up
to
that
time
all
the
land
was
considered
to
belong
to
the
king
who
divided
it
among
the
great
chiefs
these
in
turn
apportioning
their
shares
among
the
lesser
chiefs
of
whom
the
people
held
their
small
plots
of
ground
all
paid
tribute
to
those
above
them
in
rank
kamehameha
i
in
order
to
increase
his
own
power
and
destroy
that
of
the
chiefs
distributed
their
lands
to
them
in
widely
separated
portions
rather
than
in
large
continuous
tracts
as
had
been
the
custom
previously
kamehameha
was
elected
by
the
chiefs
as
king
of
all
the
hawaiian
islands
and
founded
the
dynasty
called
by
his
name
under
which
his
people
had
peace
for
nearly
eighty
years
he
adroitly
used
the
tabu
to
strengthen
his
power
and
availing
himself
of
the
wise
advice
of
the
few
benevolent
foreigners
whom
he
knew
he
sought
in
every
way
to
further
the
best
interests
of
his
people
he
has
been
called
one
of
the
notable
men
of
the
earth
the
bronze
statue
of
kamehameha
i
stands
in
front
of
the
judiciary
building
in
honolulu
the
anniversary
of
the
birthday
of
the
great
ruler
occurs
in
june
and
is
celebrated
by
the
natives
far
and
near
his
statue
is
dressed
in
his
royal
cape
of
bird
feathers
and
decorated
with
leis
of
flowers
by
the
sons
and
daughters
of
hawaii
the
strength
of
character
of
kamehameha
i
is
shown
in
many
ways
but
especially
in
the
stand
he
took
in
regard
to
liquor
which
was
having
a
disastrous
effect
on
his
people
when
he
became
convinced
that
alcoholic
drinks
were
injurious
he
decided
never
to
taste
them
again
before
the
close
of
his
life
he
made
a
noble
effort
to
prevent
the
use
of
liquor
by
his
people
all
the
chiefs
on
the
island
of
hawaii
were
summoned
to
meet
in
an
immense
grass
house
which
he
had
ordered
built
at
kailua
the
ancient
capital
solely
for
this
council
when
they
were
all
assembled
the
king
entered
in
his
magnificent
cape
of
mamo
bird
feathers
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
uttered
this
command
return
to
your
homes
and
destroy
every
distillery
on
the
island
make
no
more
intoxicating
liquors
at
the
death
of
kamehameha
i
in
his
son
liholiho
succeeded
him
as
kamehameha
ii
unfortunately
he
did
not
carry
out
his
father
wishes
he
was
like
his
father
in
nothing
but
name
being
weak
and
dissipated
and
easily
influenced
by
the
unscrupulous
foreigners
who
surrounded
him
many
changes
took
place
in
his
reign
but
so
strong
had
the
government
been
made
by
his
father
that
it
survived
them
all
fortunately
too
an
able
woman
one
of
the
wives
of
the
first
kamehameha
was
associated
with
the
king
as
queen
regent
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
hawaiians
had
burned
their
idols
and
abolished
tabu
it
was
the
influence
of
europeans
that
had
led
to
these
radical
changes
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
trade
in
sandalwood
sprang
up
in
return
for
which
many
manufactured
articles
were
imported
especially
rum
firearms
and
cheap
ornaments
this
trade
brought
increased
numbers
of
foreigners
to
the
islands
and
their
sneers
undermined
the
faith
of
the
people
in
their
old
gods
without
offering
them
any
other
religion
as
a
substitute
in
this
connection
we
are
told
that
twice
kamehameha
i
made
an
effort
to
learn
something
about
christianity
when
he
heard
that
the
people
of
tahiti
had
embraced
the
new
faith
he
inquired
of
a
foreigner
about
it
but
the
man
could
tell
him
nothing
again
just
before
his
death
he
asked
an
american
trader
to
tell
him
about
the
white
man
god
but
as
a
native
afterward
reported
to
the
missionaries
he
no
tell
him
this
greatest
of
the
hawaiians
prepared
the
way
but
he
himself
died
without
hearing
of
christ
the
hawaiians
had
now
swept
their
house
clean
and
they
were
ready
for
an
entirely
new
set
of
furnishings
in
a
land
far
away
beyond
the
pacific
these
were
preparing
for
them
and
the
short
reign
of
this
second
kamehameha
was
made
memorable
not
only
by
the
changes
already
mentioned
but
also
by
the
coming
of
the
missionaries
in
obookiah
whose
real
name
was
opukahaia
was
a
young
hawaiian
who
shipped
as
seaman
on
a
whaler
about
and
was
taken
to
new
haven
where
he
found
people
who
befriended
him
and
undertook
to
give
him
an
education
they
sent
him
to
the
foreign
mission
school
which
had
been
established
at
cornwall
connecticut
for
young
men
from
heathen
lands
among
his
mates
were
four
others
from
his
native
islands
it
had
been
his
purpose
to
carry
the
christian
religion
to
his
home
but
he
was
taken
seriously
ill
at
the
school
and
on
his
he
pleaded
with
his
new
friends
not
to
forget
his
country
his
appeal
led
the
first
missionaries
to
embark
for
those
shores
three
young
hawaiians
from
the
school
went
with
them
as
assistants
when
the
christian
teachers
arrived
it
is
said
that
the
captain
of
the
ship
sent
an
officer
ashore
with
the
hawaiian
boys
after
awhile
they
returned
shouting
out
their
wonderful
news
liholiho
is
king
the
tabus
are
abolished
the
idols
are
burnt
there
has
been
war
now
there
is
peace
the
missionaries
received
a
cordial
welcome
from
some
of
the
natives
of
high
station
the
former
high
priest
met
them
with
the
words
i
knew
that
the
wooden
images
of
gods
carved
by
our
own
hands
could
not
supply
our
wants
but
i
worshiped
them
because
it
was
a
custom
of
our
fathers
my
thought
has
always
been
there
is
only
one
great
god
dwelling
in
the
heavens
the
chief
kalaimoku
neatly
dressed
in
foreign
clothes
boarded
the
ship
accompanied
by
the
two
queen
dowagers
and
welcomed
each
of
the
newcomers
in
turn
with
a
warm
hand
clasp
one
of
the
queens
asked
the
american
women
to
make
her
a
white
dress
while
they
were
sailing
along
the
coast
to
wear
on
meeting
the
king
when
she
went
ashore
in
her
new
white
mother
hubbard
a
shout
greeted
her
from
hundreds
of
throats
because
the
gown
was
so
loose
that
she
could
both
run
and
stand
in
it
the
natives
called
it
a
holoku
meaning
it
became
the
national
dress
the
queens
afterward
sent
the
missionaries
bananas
cocoanuts
and
other
foods
as
a
token
of
their
pleasure
the
americans
were
received
kindly
by
the
king
after
explaining
their
mission
and
were
allowed
to
remain
in
the
islands
they
had
many
trials
and
privations
but
they
were
strong
in
their
faith
and
within
twenty
years
they
had
the
joy
of
baptizing
thousands
of
converts
kamehameha
ii
fearing
the
russians
one
trader
had
actually
gone
so
far
as
to
hoist
the
russian
flag
over
some
forts
that
he
had
built
visited
the
united
states
with
his
queen
and
then
went
on
to
england
to
ask
for
protection
which
was
promised
them
by
george
iv
they
both
died
there
in
and
their
remains
were
sent
home
in
a
british
commanded
by
lord
byron
cousin
of
the
poet
when
kamehameha
iii
was
made
ruler
all
the
unprincipled
white
men
in
oahu
immediately
set
to
work
to
lead
him
into
every
form
of
dissipation
but
they
were
not
to
succeed
with
him
as
they
had
with
his
predecessor
there
were
men
of
ability
in
that
band
of
missionaries
and
they
had
great
influence
with
him
these
faithful
advisers
had
a
large
share
in
framing
the
liberal
constitution
which
he
granted
it
is
of
special
interest
to
note
that
the
year
before
the
constitution
was
adopted
a
bill
of
rights
was
promulgated
which
set
forth
the
fundamental
principles
of
government
and
is
often
called
the
hawaiian
magna
charta
an
eminent
writer
has
given
us
the
provisions
of
this
document
it
asserts
the
right
of
every
man
to
life
limb
liberty
freedom
from
oppression
the
earnings
of
his
hand
and
the
productions
of
his
mind
not
however
to
those
who
act
in
violation
of
the
laws
it
gave
natives
for
the
first
time
the
right
to
hold
land
in
fee
simple
before
that
the
king
had
owned
all
the
land
and
no
one
could
buy
it
in
this
document
it
is
also
declared
that
is
hereby
secured
to
the
persons
of
all
the
people
together
with
their
lands
their
building
lots
and
all
their
property
while
they
conform
to
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
and
that
laws
must
be
enacted
for
the
protection
of
subjects
as
well
as
rulers
a
commission
was
also
formed
to
determine
the
ownership
of
the
land
by
this
commission
of
all
the
land
was
confirmed
to
the
king
to
the
chiefs
and
to
the
common
people
as
far
as
possible
the
people
share
was
so
divided
that
each
person
received
the
piece
of
ground
that
he
was
living
on
the
king
and
many
of
the
chiefs
turned
over
of
their
share
to
the
government
which
soon
held
nearly
of
all
the
landed
property
in
the
kingdom
the
first
constitution
was
framed
in
about
ten
years
later
an
improved
one
was
adopted
the
legislature
was
to
meet
in
two
houses
the
nobles
were
to
be
chosen
by
the
king
for
life
and
were
not
to
be
more
than
thirty
in
number
there
were
to
be
not
less
than
representatives
who
were
to
be
elected
by
the
people
the
supreme
court
was
to
be
composed
of
three
members
a
chief
justice
and
two
associate
justices
four
circuit
courts
were
to
be
established
and
besides
the
judges
for
these
each
district
was
to
have
a
judge
who
should
settle
petty
cases
it
was
in
early
in
the
reign
of
kamehameha
iii
that
kapiolani
daughter
of
the
high
chief
of
hilo
defied
the
power
of
pele
having
become
a
christian
she
determined
to
give
her
people
an
object
lesson
on
the
powerlessness
of
their
gods
with
a
retinue
of
eighty
persons
she
journeyed
most
of
the
way
on
foot
one
hundred
miles
to
the
crater
of
kilauea
when
near
the
crater
she
was
met
by
the
priestess
of
pele
who
threatened
her
with
death
if
she
broke
the
tabus
but
kapiolani
ate
the
sacred
berries
without
first
offering
some
to
the
goddess
and
undaunted
made
her
way
with
her
followers
down
five
hundred
feet
to
the
black
ledge
there
on
the
very
margin
of
the
fiery
lake
of
halemaumau
she
addressed
her
followers
in
these
ringing
words
jehovah
is
my
god
he
kindled
these
fires
i
fear
not
pele
if
i
perish
by
the
anger
of
pele
then
you
may
fear
the
power
of
pele
but
if
i
trust
in
jehovah
and
he
should
save
me
from
the
wrath
of
pele
then
you
must
fear
and
serve
the
lord
jehovah
all
the
gods
of
hawaii
are
vain
then
they
sang
a
hymn
of
praise
to
jehovah
and
wended
their
way
back
to
the
crater
rim
in
safety
it
was
during
the
reign
of
kamehameha
iii
that
the
united
states
france
and
great
britain
recognized
the
independence
of
the
hawaiian
islands
before
this
news
reached
the
pacific
however
lord
george
paulet
a
british
naval
officer
took
possession
and
hoisted
the
british
flag
because
the
king
refused
to
yield
to
his
demands
five
months
later
admiral
thomas
in
command
of
great
britain
fleet
in
the
east
appeared
at
honolulu
and
restored
the
country
to
the
natives
in
recognition
an
attractive
public
park
was
named
for
him
at
the
thanksgiving
service
held
on
that
day
the
king
uttered
the
words
which
were
afterward
adopted
as
the
motto
of
the
nation
the
translation
of
which
is
in
righteousness
is
the
life
of
the
land
the
independence
of
hawaii
was
only
once
again
threatened
by
a
foreign
power
when
a
french
admiral
took
possession
of
the
fort
and
the
government
buildings
at
honolulu
for
a
few
days
indeed
that
independence
was
not
only
recognized
but
guaranteed
by
france
england
and
the
united
states
many
of
the
missionaries
settled
in
hawaii
and
their
descendants
have
become
rich
and
prominent
citizens
hawaii
owes
much
to
them
so
far
as
lay
in
their
power
they
taught
the
people
trades
and
introduced
new
england
ideals
of
government
and
education
two
years
after
they
arrived
a
spelling
book
was
printed
and
a
few
years
later
the
printing
office
sent
out
a
newspaper
in
the
native
language
the
first
boarding
school
for
boys
was
started
by
lorrin
andrews
in
on
maui
and
it
was
not
long
after
that
one
was
established
for
girls
the
hilo
boarding
school
which
came
later
was
the
one
that
general
armstrong
took
many
suggestions
from
for
his
work
for
the
coloured
people
at
hampton
institute
in
virginia
indeed
so
eager
were
the
hawaiians
to
learn
of
their
new
teachers
that
whole
villages
came
to
the
mission
stations
men
and
women
becoming
pupils
and
the
chiefs
leading
the
way
as
early
as
hoapili
governor
of
maui
made
the
rule
that
all
children
over
four
years
of
age
should
attend
school
and
no
man
or
woman
who
was
unable
to
read
and
write
should
hold
office
or
receive
a
license
to
marry
soon
after
that
laws
were
passed
making

any
man
who
had
a
child

years
of

did
not

the

set

an
anecdote
of
this
transition
period
is
found
in
a
book
written
by
one
who
styled
himself
simply
a
foreigner
in
the
valley
of
halawa
on
the
island
of
molokai
he
was
entertained
at
the
house
of
the
district
judge
a
hawaiian
among
the
furnishings
of
the
house
were
a
table
a
bedstead
some
chairs
even
a
rocking
chair
he
gives
an
amusing
description
of
his
evening
meal
in
this
house
first
of
all
the
table
was
covered
with
a
sheet
just
taken
off
the
bed
the
table
service
consisted
of
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
procured
from
the
foot
of
a
long
woolen
stocking
a
single
plate
a
tumbler
and
a
calabash
of
pure
water
from
a
neighbouring
spring
the
eatables
were
composed
of
fresh
fish
baked
in
wrappers
of
the
ti
leaf
a
couple
of
boiled
fowls
a
huge
dish
of
sweet
potatoes
and
another
of
boiled
tara
taro
the
last
thing
served
upon
the
table
was
something
which
the
family
had
learned
to
designate
by
the
name
of
in
english
this
was
emptied
into
large
bowls
and
was
intended
for
the
family
group
myself
included
the
cook
was
a
strapping
kanaka
rather
more
than
six
feet
in
height
and
would
have
weighed
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
while
i
was
the
only
occupant
of
the
table
the
family
had
formed
a
circle
on
their
mats
where
they
were
discussing
their
supper
with
the
utmost
eagerness
devoted
his
entire
attention
to
me
he
was
a
good
specimen
of
a
well
native
i
could
see
his
frame
to
advantage
for
his
sole
dress
consisted
of
a
short
woolen
shirt
and
the
malo
and
his
head
of
hair
resembled
that
of
the
pictured
medusa
when
i
first
sat
down
to
the
table
he
took
up
my
plate
and
with
a
mouthful
of
breath
which
was
really
a
small
breeze
he
blew
the
dust
from
it
this
act
occasioned
me
no
small
merriment
but
when
in
supplying
me
with
he
took
up
a
bowl
and
wiped
it
out
with
the
corner
of
his
flannel
shirt
i
could
refrain
no
longer
i
laughed
until
my
sides
fairly
ached
and
the
tears
streamed
down
my
face
for
a
moment
the
family
were
taken
by
surprise
and
so
was
this
presiding
deity
of
culinary
operations
but
on
a
second
outburst
from
myself
they
felt
reassured
and
joined
with
me
in
my
laughter
the
cook
however
seemed
to
feel
that
i
had
laughed
at
some
one
of
his
blunders
so
he
dipped
the
bowl
in
a
calabash
of
water
washed
it
out
with
his
greasy
fingers
and
again
wiped
it
out
with
that
same
shirt
lap
this
was
done
three
times
in
answer
to
the
laughter
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
restrain
and
when
he
had
filled
the
bowl
with
tea
and
saw
that
it
remained
untasted
he
put
a
large
quantity
of
sugar
into
the
huge
shook
it
up
placed
it
at
my
right
elbow
and
told
me
to
drink
the
evening
was
closed
with
solemn
devotions
the
best
bed
in
the
house
was
placed
at
my
disposal
and
upon
it
was
replaced
the
sheet
on
which
i
had
just
before
supped
and
on
which
i
slept
during
that
night
the
bed
was
carefully
stuffed
with
a
soft
downy
substance
resembling
raw
silk
but
called
by
the
natives
and
culled
from
the
the
pillows
were
stuffed
with
the
same
material

succeeded
by
his
nephew
and
adopted
son
kamehameha
iv
although
he
had
a
violent
temper
he
had
many
good
qualities
his
wife
was
queen
emma
granddaughter
of
john
young
who
was
very
english
in
her
tastes
it
was
in
her
honour
that
the
king
founded
the
hospital
and
it
was
probably
due
to
her
influence
that
he
started
the
anglican
mission
and
made
an
excellent
translation
of
the
english
prayer
book
into
the
hawaiian
language
the
harbour
of
honolulu
was
enlarged
by
him
and
other
improvements
were
made
and
the
cultivation
of
rice
was
introduced
after
his
death

occurred
in

queen
emma
made
an
attempt
to
obtain
the

but
was
unsuccessful
it
was
about
this
time
thirty
years
before
my
first
visit
to
hawaii
that
my
father
lieutenant
perkins
of
the
was
ordered
to
the
pacific
and
for
two
years
was
stationed
at
honolulu
he
spent
much
of
his
spare
time
in
traveling
over
the
islands
even
to
their
remotest
corners
he
enjoyed
visiting
the
ranches
and
joining
in
the
exciting
though
perilous
occupation
of
driving
wild
cattle
down
from
the
mountains
where
one
safety
depended
almost
wholly
on
skilful
horsemanship
he
ascended
to
the
great
crater
of
kilauea
went
to
every
interesting
locality
studied
the
natives
attended
their
feasts
and
learned
their
customs
these
things
were
described
in
his
letters
and
such
a
newspaper
bit
as
the
following
gives
a
glimpse
of
the
duties
of
a

arrived
at

after

immediately
sailed

the

retorted
with

while
the
was
at

an
event
occurred
which
was
referred
to
in
the
discussions
of
congress
with
regard
to
hawaiian
matters
in
the
session
of
as
illustrating
the
policy
of
our
government
the
official
record
of
the
government
affords
a
very
complete
story
of
how
the
united
states
became
the
possessor
of
what
is
now
called
midway
island
it
was
first
known
as
brooks
island
but
was
renamed
by
our
navy
department
principally
on
the
unofficial
suggestion
of
the
pacific
mail
steamship
company
in
recognition
of
its
geographical
position
on
the
route
from
hawaii
to
japan
the
attention
of
welles
then
secretary
of
the
navy
was
called
to
this
island
as
possibly
destined
to
prove
of
early
importance
as
a
coaling
station
for
united
states
vessels
cruising
in
these
waters
secretary
welles
issued
an
order
to
rear
admiral
thatcher
commanding
the
or
some
other
suitable
vessel
to
search
for
the
island
and
having
found
it
to
take
possession
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
my
father
letters
give
an
account
of
this
trip
august
he
wrote
just
now
we
are
sailing
along
quietly
although
we
have
been
greatly
startled
and
had
a
few
moments
of
terrible
anxiety
one
of
the
men
while
furling
the
sail
lost
his
hold
and
fell
overboard
of
course
falling
from
such
a
height
we
all
thought
he
was
killed
the
life
buoys
were
cut
away
and
the
ship
hove
to
and
the
boat
sent
for
him
which
picked
him
up
and
found
him
but
little
hurt
after
all
it
was
such
a
narrow
escape
we
were
all
greatly
relieved
when
we
got
him
aboard
all
right
except
this
we
are
sailing
along
day
after
day
in
perfect
monotony
and
for
two
months
or
more
we
shall
not
see
a
strange
face
or
hear
a
word
of
news
from
home
but
the
weather
is
delightful
and
my
health
is
good
august
breakers
have
been
reported
from
the

and
i
hope
it
is
the
island
we
are
looking
for

it
proved
to
be
the
land
we
were

off

called
after
the
captain
who
discovered
it
a
few
years

and
probably
never
before
or
since
has
there
been
any
one
there
it
is
low
and
sandy
about
six
miles
long
and
its
inhabitants
are
only
sea
gulls
and
other
sea
birds
seals
and
turtles
never
having
seen
human
beings
before
they
are
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
us
and
we
can
catch
as
many
of
them
as
we
wish
i
have
been
fishing
and
caught
a
boatload
of
fish
and
eleven
turtles
each
one
of
the
latter
weighing
two
hundred
pounds
and
over
we
are
going
to
remain
here
and
survey
the
island

it
has
come
on
to
rain
and
we
are
all
cooped
up

a
ceremony
and
take
possession

captain
william

the
officer
in

was
very
proud
of
having
been
concerned
in
taking
possession
of
the
first
island
beyond
our
own
shores
ever
added
to
the
dominion
of
the
united
states
in
his
report
he
well
describes
the
somewhat
dramatic
and
spectacular
performance
i
have
the
honour
to
report
that
on
wednesday
the
of
august
in
compliance
with
the
orders
of
the
hon
secretary
of
the
navy
of
may
i
took
formal
possession
of
brooks
island
and
reefs
for
the
united
states
having
previously
erected
a
suitable
flagstaff
i
landed
on
that
day
accompanied
by
all
the
officers
who
could
be
spared
from
the
ship
with
six
boats
armed
and
equipped
and
under
a
salute
of
guns
and
with
three
cheers
hoisted
the
national
ensign
and
called
on
all
hands
to
witness
the
act
of
taking
possession
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
the
ceremony
of
taking
possession
over
the
howitzers
and
men
and
marines
were
exercised
at
having
hauled
the
seine
and
procured
an
abundant
supply
of
fish
the
men
cooked
their
dinner
on
shore
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
pleasantly
picnic
fashion
upon
the
island
i
sincerely
hope
that
this
will
by
no
means
be
the
last
of
our
insular
annexations
i
venture
to
name
the
only
harbour
at
this
island
after

to
the

had

one
of
the
thrilling
tales
of
the
sea
nothing
further
seems
to
have
been
done
by
our
government
until
three
or
four
decades
later
when
it
sought
to
insure
safety
to
navigation
by
establishing
there
a
lighthouse
and
buoys
after
the
visits
of

was
started
in
an
effort
to
stop
the
spread
of
leprosy
as
every
one
knows
it
was
here
that
father
damien
the
catholic
priest
devoted
his
life
to
caring
for
the
sufferers
and

succumbed
to
the
disease
the
king
died
in

last
of
his
line
just
before
his
death
he
turned
to
bishop
and
asked
her
to
become
queen
she
refused
thinking
she
could
serve
her
people
better
in
some
other
way
and
the
king
passed
away
without
naming
his
successor
it
was
suggested
that
either
the
sister
of
kamehameha

or
one
of
the
high
chiefs
should
be
placed
on
the
throne
but
prince
lunalilo

was
thus

the
authority
lost
by
the
crown
when
the

was
granted
and
his
government
kept
growing
more
arbitrary
and
corrupt
finally
so
much
feeling
was
roused
that
the
foreign
element
compelled
kalakaua
to
proclaim
a
new
constitution
by
which
he
lost
the
power
he
had
previously
possessed
and
white
men
gained
more
control

two
years
later
the

kalakaua
was
only
a

in
no
way

sent

sent

to

to
report
on

there
after
receiving

from

the

sent

really
a
demand
to

to
restore
the

to
power
it
was
impossible
for
americans
to
accede
to
such
a
demand
and
they
replied
through
hon
dole
that
the

respectfully
and
unhesitatingly
declines
to
entertain
the
proposition
of
the
president
of

should
surrender
its
authority
to

then
in
despairing
of
immediate
annexation
they
formed
a

it
was
proposed
by
some
of
the
people
that
princess
kaiulani
cleghorn
daughter
and
the
queen
niece
should
be
proclaimed
queen
and
a
regency
with

at
its
head
established
until
the
princess
came
of
age
but
the
american
element
did
not
feel
that
an
honest
government
would
be
insured
by
this
means
kaiulani
who
was
being
educated
in
england
came
here
and
issued
an
appeal
to
americans
but
was
unable
to
awaken
sympathy
she
died
soon
after
the
new
republic
of
hawaii
thus
began
its
history
under
the
leadership
of
the
man
of
whom
it
is
said
that
he
throughout
his
life
had
been
identified
with
all
that
was
least
partizan
and
most
upright
in
the
islands
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
a
vast
amount
of
political
was
guarded
against
in
the
constitution
then
adopted
by
the
provision
that
the
president
at
the
close
of
his
term
of
six
years
should
be
ineligible
to
reëlection
for

succeeding

after

short

the
oceanic

all
formed
largely
because

the
favourable

they
were
able

make
for
carrying
sugar
and
the
pacific
mail
steamship
company
which
plied
between

and

stopped
at

because
of
the
profit
to
be
made
by
carrying

from

american
shipping
on
the
pacific
however
has
always
been
at
a
disadvantage
because
foreign
ships
can
be
built
more
cheaply
than
ours
and
are
usually
subsidized

if
these
drawbacks
were
not
enough

somewhat
modified

not
be
procured
in
sufficient
numbers
nor
can
such
boats
generally
be
run
with
sufficient
economy
to
compete
with
foreign
flags
so
trade
has
been
given
over
almost
entirely
to
the
japanese
who
have
especially
fine
passenger
ships
on
that
route
as
according
to
our
laws
these
boats
are
not
permitted
to
carry
passengers
or
freight
between
american
ports
the
service
between
the
islands
and
the
united
states
has
been
seriously
crippled
with
consequent
increase
in
rates

carriage
a
resident
in
the
islands
writes
when
the
last
pacific
mail
steamer
sailed
from
honolulu
harbour
all
flags
were
at
half
mast
and
hawaii
was
in
mourning
still
the
planters
are
cheerful
for
they
look
forward
to
an
estimated
production
of
tons
and
a
continuance
of
the
present
high
prices
which
will
enable
them
not
only
to
pay
good
dividends
but
also
to
install
machinery
and
to
make
other
improvements
by
which
they
will
produce
sugar
more
cheaply

the

of

importance
to

the

is
as
carefully
prepared
as
a

the

thoroughly
pulverized
the

are
set
in
furrows
and
there
are
sometimes
as
many
as
twelve
thousand

mature
their
fruit
in
about
two
years

the
pineapple
ripens
from
the

appear
which
bear

one

in

are

new

are
grown
not
only
from
suckers
and
slips
but
also
from
the
crowns
of
the

and
growers
consider
them
all
about
equally
good
the
plants
almost
never
produce
seeds
and
when
found
they
are
used
for
experimental
purposes
only
there
are
acres
of
land
in
the
pineapple
plantations
of
the

and
most
of
them
are
on
oahu
there
is
never
any
frost
and
as
there
are
no
serious
insect
pests
which
attack
the
fruit
the
crop
is
a
very
fine
one
nor
is
irrigation
necessary
so
that
thousands
of
acres
unavailable
for

have
brought

while
plantation
life
in

may
be
monotonous
for
the
resident
it
is
full
of
interest
for
the
tourist
who
really
takes
time
to
see
it
an
effort
is
made
by
the
planters
to
furnish
recreation
for
their

at
waialua
on

a
large
hall
has
been
built
where
shows
are
given
at
intervals
political
meetings
are
held
and
there
are
dances
for
the
white
colony
the
latter
have
tennis
courts
near
their
homes
and
hold
tournaments
to
which
they
invite
players
from

as
work
is
over
at
four
the
hours
being
from
five
to
eleven
in
the
morning
and
two
to
four
in

afternoon
the
men
who
work
in
mill
store
or
office
can
play
every
afternoon
the
portuguese
japanese
and
hawaiian
boys
have
formed
a
baseball
team
which
represents
the
plantation
in
a
league
of
such
teams
there
are
match
games
by
this
league
at
different
places
every
sunday
the
japanese
at
waialua
have
a
theater
the
occasional
performances
at
which
are
announced
during
the
day
by
a
man
who
drives
through
all
parts
of
the
plantation
in
a
hack
covered
with
japanese
signs
beating
a
drum
the
native
hawaiians
in
country
districts
often
present
tableaux
for
the
benefit
of
their
church
or
some
charity
fund
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
she
had
once
gone
to
a
representation
of
adam
and
eve
which
would
have
seemed
either
sacrilegious
or
ridiculous
if
done
by
any
but
these
ingenuous
children
the
minister
of
the
church
played
the
part
of
satan
in
a
bright
red
union
suit
with
a
long
tail
a
large
native
in
flowing
white
robes
with
a
santa
claus
beard
and
mask
took
the
part
of
the
deity
and
banished
adam
and
eve
in
brown
union
suits
the
colour
of
their
skin
from
the
garden
of
eden
other
tableaux
gave
very
vivid
portrayals
of
scenes
from
ancient
days
of
royalty
with
its
attendant
pomp
and
ceremony
and
old
hawaiian
legends
one
of
these
was
about
paahana
a
young
hawaiian
girl
who
was
afraid
of
the
white
settlers
and
ran
away
to
the
mountains
building
herself
a
shelter
of
grass
among
the
bushes
finally
she
was
discovered
by
the
white
missionaries
who
tried
to
approach
her
but
she
was
wild
with
fear
and
vanished
from
sight
into
the
forest
this
story
was
told
in
verse
sung
to
the
tune
of
mauna
kea
a
hula
dance
these
entertainments
are
never
complete
without
a
dance
for
young
and
old
to
music
sung
and
played
by
a
quintette
of
native
boys
besides
the
ukulele
and
the
which
is
a
large
ukulele
with
five
strings
instead
of
four
they
use
the
mandolin
violin
guitar
and
the
hawaiians
being
naturally
musical
have
a
keen
sense
of
time
and
rhythm
the
filipinos
are
also
fond
of
dancing
and
in
the
libby
mcniel
and
libby
pineapple
cannery
where
many
of
this
nationality
are
employed
dances
are
held
to
make
them
more
contented
with
their
isolated
life
among
the
plantation
labourers
there
is
never
the
abject
poverty
that
is
known
in
the
far
east
for
in
addition
to
steady
wages
houses
water
fuel
and
doctor
services
are
all
provided
for
them
although
the
climate
is
sunstroke
is
unknown
the
men
who
work
around
the
machinery
and
the
boiling
sugar
wear
as
few
clothes
as
possible
and
the
women
who
sew
up
the
bags
of
sugar
as
fast
as
they
are
filled
have
adopted
the
cool
and
comfortable
but
hideous
hawaiian
garb
of
the
holoku
the
heat
from
the
great
boilers
in
the
mill
is
sometimes
hard
for
the
white
men
to
bear
but
i
have
never
heard
of
a
case
of
as
a
large
part
of
the
school
work
must
be
done
on
the
plantations
i
insert
the
following
description
given
me
by
one
of
the
teachers
of
the
school
at
waialua
oahu
the
largest
outside
of
honolulu
as
the
pupils
are
almost
entirely
foreign
the
first
grade
has
three
divisions
to
accommodate
the
number
who
enter
it
until
they
are
able
to
speak
enough
english
to
be
properly
graded
sometimes
one
finds
here
children
of
twelve
to
fourteen
years
who
have
just
come
to
hawaii
as
a
rule
they
work
hard
to
get
out
of
the
and
are
quickly
promoted
i
was
the
only
white
teacher
in
the
school
besides
the
principal
the
other
teachers
were
hawaiian
and
chinese
hawaiian
girls
who
had
gone
through
the
honolulu
normal
school
they
are
good
teachers
kind
and
patient
and
can
instruct
children
in
the
same
slow
manner
in
which
they
themselves
learn
there
was
also
a
young
hawaiian
man
a
normal
graduate
who
could
help
in
many
extra
ways
such
as
games
etc
fifteen
nationalities
were
represented
in
the
various
grades
hawaiian
chinese
japanese
portuguese
filipino
spanish
korean
porto
rican
and
a
few
scotch
english
canadians
germans
and
americans
as
well
as
russians
and
italians
besides
the
pure
bloods
there
were
many
mixtures
such
as
etc
the
japanese
and
chinese
were
the
best
pupils
in
every
way
the
hawaiians
were
tractable
but
stupid
portuguese
smart
but
mischievous
school
hours
were
from
nine
to
twelve
and
from
half
past
twelve
to
two
most
of
the
children
came
from
long
distances
and
after
the
plantation
school
was
dismissed
the
japanese
children
went
to
a
japanese
school
for
two
hours
in
the
first
grade
i
taught
reading
writing
and
also
in
simple
form
folk
songs
and
dances
these
last
helped
them
a
great
deal
in
the
new
vocabulary
as
they
loved
that
part
of
the
day
program
it
was
interesting
to
note
the
habits
of
the
different
nationalities
at
recess
especially
in
regard
to
their
luncheon
the
japanese
usually
were
together
out
in
the
yard
they
each
had
their
little
tin
pail
with
top
and
bottom
section
in
which
they
carried
fish
and
cold
rice
i
never
got
a
very
close
look
at
it
to
know
how
the
fish
was
cooked
but
i
could
smell
it
afar
off
they
seemed
very
shy
and
would
try
to
hide
their
lunch
as
i
walked
past
the
chinese
were
even
shyer
about
their
lunch
for
they
never
gathered
together
as
the
other
nationalities
did
but
went
to
some
secluded
spot
and
nibbled
away
at
an
orange
or
something
else
the
portuguese
usually
brought
long
rolls
of
bread
which
had
been
cut
open
and
a
red
substance
spread
all
along
the
inside
they
also
had
fruit
and
especially
the
mango
in
its
season
a
little
japanese
store
nearby
kept
cakes
and
pastries
which
were
very
popular
when
the
children
had
money
but
the
greatest
delicacy
sold
there
seemed
to
be
a
rubbery
substance
which
looked
like
a
piece
of
resin
but
could
be
shaved
in
long
strips
they
called
it
dry
squid
but
it
did
not
seem
like
the
dry
squid
i
tried
to
masticate
at
native
luaus
and
i
never
did
find
out
just
what
it
was
the
schools
are
all
supported
by
the
territorial
government
which
in
turn
receives
the
plantation
taxes
so
the
plantations
themselves
do
not
directly
support
the
schools
although
the
children
of
the
labourers
comprise
of
the
pupils
outside
honolulu
there
is
compulsory
attendance
until
the
age
of
fourteen
and
at
waialua
a
school
policeman
a
hawaiian
went
all
over
the
plantations
on
horseback
and
found
out
if
any
of
the
children
were
ill
or
playing
truant
each
nationality
is
housed
more
or
less
by
itself
in
small
houses
built
in
rows
each
group
called
a
camp
the
white
men
employed
as
chemists
bookkeepers
and
clerks
in
the
general
store
usually
live
in
a
group
near
the
buildings
where
they
are
employed
they
are
german
scotch
norwegian
english
and
danish
few
americans
go
into
this
work
now
although
a
number
did
in
years
past
start
out
as
and
have
become
managers
the
kanaka
does
not
make
a
good
manager
but
if
he
has
some
one
to
direct
him
he
works
well
and
he
can
learn
almost
any
trade
of
course
he
is
at
his
best
as
a
sailor
and
he
is
such
a
wonderful
rider
that
he
makes
an
excellent
cowboy
at
waialua
there
is
a
small
hospital
where
the
labourers
are
treated
free
and
in
at
least
one
of
the
outlying
camps
there
is
a
small
cottage
that
is
used
as
a
dispensary
the
plantation
doctor
has
charge
of
the
school
children
vaccinating
all
that
need
it
at
the
opening
of
the
school
year
and
watching
them
for
signs
of
trachoma
or
leprosy
social
work
on
plantations
has
not
been
carried
on
with
a
central
organization
as
yet
and
the
welfare
of
the
labourers
depends
on
the
attitude
of
the
managers
who
all
belong
to
the
sugar
association
this
holds
yearly
meetings
of
a
week
or
more
in
honolulu
when
managers
from
all
the
islands
talk
over
questions
pertaining
to
their
interests
the
agricultural
situation
in
the
islands
has
been
carefully
studied
by
the
bureau
of
agriculture
and
forestry
which
reports
that
there
are
no
other
crops
than
sugar
and
pineapples
which
can
be
recommended
as
a
reliable
industry
for
the
territory
this
is
true
for
several
important
reasons
in
the
first
place
from
an
agricultural
point
of
view
hawaii
is
not
a
tropical
country
and
the
strictly
tropical
crops
do
not
find
optimum
climatic
conditions
neither
has
hawaii
a
temperate
climate
and
the
staple
products
of
the
temperate
zone
can
not
be
relied
upon
the
distance
from
the
mainland
markets
imposes
a
serious
handicap
moreover
both
and
transportation
is
difficult
and
expensive
because
hawaii
is
a
group
of
comparatively
small
mountainous
islands
with
very
few
harbours
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
moreover
that
the
area
of
cultivated
land
in
hawaii
is
very
small
the
amount
reclaimable
still
smaller
while
the
needs
of
a
growing
population
must
be
met
this
of
course
means
intensive
cultivation
and
a
high
average
rate
of
wealth
production
per
acre
in
the
period
from
to
the
population
increased
per
cent
and
the
area
of
tillable
land
per
cent
the
census
reports
also
show
that
hawaii
is
already
cultivating
its
land
far
more
intensively
than
the
mainland
states
for
example
it
supports
times
as
many
persons
per
acre
of
improved
arable
land
as
the
agricultural
state
of
north
dakota
clearly
the
problem
in
hawaii
is
peculiarly
difficult
it
is
true
also
that
practically
all
tropical
industries
demand
a
plentiful
supply
of
cheap
labour
labour
in
hawaii
is
neither
cheap
nor
plentiful
in
this
respect
the
islands
are
at
a
disadvantage
compared
with
nearly
all
tropical
countries
but
much
money
has
been
spent
on
the
industries
and
the
results
are
certainly
encouraging
how
to
secure
cheap
labour
has
always
been
a
serious
question
for
the
planters
the
bureau
of
immigration
was
established
in
when
the
reciprocity
treaty
with
the
united
states
was
signed
several
thousand
portuguese
were
sent
for
by
the
government
and
the
planters
and
many
of
them
have
remained
in
the
country
and
become
good
citizens
about
the
year
however
it
was
decided
that
the
chinese
and
the
japanese
should
be
encouraged
to
come
because
the
cost
of
transportation
for
them
was
so
much
less
for
some
years
the
larger
part
of
the
labourers
were
of
these
two
nationalities
the
japanese
are
still
far
in
excess
of
all
others
numbering
over
after
annexation
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
prohibited
immigration
by
the
yellow
races
hawaii
was
obliged
to
seek
a
supply
from
other
sources
filipinos
of
whom
there
are
only
are
next
in
number
to
the
japanese
portuguese
chinese
spaniards
and
porto
ricans
stand
next
after
the
expenses
of
the
voyage
were
paid
the
labourers
did
not
always
keep
their
agreement
to
work
so
contract
labour
was
introduced
although
some
objections
have
been
made
to
the
contract
system
in
hawaii
it
must
have
proved
fairly
satisfactory
to
both
parties
for
in
those
days
a
large
number
of
labourers
would
sign
a
second
contract
on
the
same
terms
showing
at
least
that
they
were
well
treated
and
paid
according
to
agreement
in
some
cases
chinese
and
japanese
labourers
remained
in
the
islands
after
their
contract
expired
and
settled
there
permanently
many
of
the
chinese
became
merchants
the
portuguese
went
into
fruit
raising
and
the
japanese
kept
mostly
to
the
coffee
plantations
in
those
days
the
japanese
had
labour
unions
and
they
were
sometimes
troublesome
hawaii
owing
to
the
lack
of
coal
and
iron
and
other
minerals
can
never
be
a
manufacturing
country
hence
must
always
depend
largely
upon
the
united
states
for
such
goods
the
islands
spend
a
large
part
of
yearly
for
imported
articles
although
since
hawaii
is
a
territory
of
the
united
states
goods
received
from
the
american
mainland
are
not
classified
in
census
returns
as
imports
with
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
the
hawaiian
islands
are
a
necessary
coaling
station
between
the
atlantic
coast
and
the
far
east
in
anticipation
of
increased
traffic
the
harbours
have
been
enlarged
new

indulge
in

you
must
stay
at

a
few
weeks
so
that
you
may
really
see
it
all
and
have
time
to
dream
of
its
wonderful
beauties
honolulu
is
the
oldest
and
so
by
far
the
most
attractive
town
in
the
islands
besides
visits
to
waikiki
the
pali
and
punchbowl
there
are
many
delightful
excursions
on
the
island
of
oahu
the
trail
and
mountain
club
has
made
excellent
paths
to
the
mountain
tops
where
you
can
get
superb
views
the
lovely
falls
of
kaliuwaa
are
especially
celebrated
while
a
trip
to
hauula
is
pleasant
the
coral
gardens
are
entrancing
and
near
these
one
can
see
the
largest
wireless
station
in
the
islands
in
the
great
pineapple
district
wahiawa
there
is
a
good
hotel
and
fine
bass
fishing
and
not
far
away
is
a
big
military
camp
the
excursion
to
the
other
islands
is
made
fairly
comfortable
on
the
steamers
of
the
navigation
company
and
one
can
motor
to
the
very
brink
of
kilauea
but
at
the
time
of
our
first
visit
the
journey
was
something
to
be
endured
for
the
sake
of
the
wonders
at
the
end
the
story
has
been
often
told
by
travelers
yet
it
may
be
worth
while
to
recount
our
own
experiences
the
trip
certainly
could
not
be
recommended
for
pleasure
in
those
days
the
tiny
boat
was
loaded
down
with
pigs
and
cattle
and
sickly
smelling
sugar
the
crossings
were
far
worse
than
the
english
channel
and
our
wretched
little
steamer
reeled
before
the
winds
and
tossed
upon
the
waves
to
add
to
our
discomfort
the
boat
was
by
no
means
swift
and
hours
were
consumed
between
the
innumerable
small
when
we
had
the
pleasure
of
stepping
on
solid
earth
once
more
we
found
very
poor
hotels
if
you
could
call
them
by
that
name
and
finally
we
were
disappointed
in
the
volcano
itself
which
was
not
active
enough
to
suit
us

leper
colony
island
of
molokai
at
our
departure
from
honolulu
we
were
quite
covered
with
leis
by
the
kind
friends
who
gathered
at
the
dock
to
see
us
off
our
boat
plunged
almost
immediately
into
the
high
seas
of
the
channel
between
oahu
and
molokai
as
we
passed
the
latter
island
we
had
a
distant
view
of
the
leper
colony
on
a
triangle
of
level
land
at
the
foot
of
a
precipice
three
thousand
feet
high
that
effectually
guards
the
patients
from
the
landward
side
at
first
the
lepers
resisted
the
attempt
to
banish
them
to
the
colony
and
their
relatives
who
seemed
to
have
no
fear
of
the
disease
concealed
those
who
were
afflicted
but
this
opposition
decreased
as
the
natives
learned
that
the
lepers
were
to
be
supported
in
comfort
by
the
government
they
have
a
school
a
library
newspapers
musical
instruments
a
theater
even
shows
now
i
am
told
in
short
everything
is
done
to
make
their
lives
as
pleasant
and
comfortable
as
possible
mark

writes
of
a
beautiful
custom
in
the
colony
would
you
expect
he
says
to
find
in
that
awful
leper
settlement
a
custom
worthy
of
transplanting
to
your
own
country

death
sets
open
the
prison

the
band
salutes
the
very
soul
with

the
natives
have
retained
their
primitive
habits
and
beliefs
more
than
on
the
others
of
the
group
the
poison
god
was
saved
at
the
time
the
idols
were
destroyed
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
kept
here
in
charge
of
kahunas
until
near
the
end
of
the
last
century
and
it
is
not
definitely
known
whether
it
may
not
even
now
be
in
existence
this
hideous
image
seems
to
have
had
the
power
to
kill
those
who
handled
it
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
was
made
of
some
poisonous
wood
and
only
the
priests
knew
how
to
hold
it
without
harm
the
boat
reeled
on
through
another
rough
passage
to
the
double
island
of
maui
consisting
of
two
great
mountain
peaks
joined
by
a
low
isthmus
of
lava
which
by
degrees
filled
up
the
channel
between
the
two
original
islands
we
made
endless
stops
and
by
means
of
small
boats
took

off

our
first

was
at

the
capital
of

and
the
rendezvous
for

only
for
its

the
northern
end
of
the
isthmus

the
home
of

known
as

the
name

battle
was
fought
near
here
by

unfortunately
we
were
unable
to
see
the

so
well
described
by
jack
london
or
visit
the
famous
iao
valley
of
which
we
had
read
such
glowing
descriptions
the
entrance
to
this
gulch
is
by
a
dark
wooded
gorge
that
broadens
out
into
an
amphitheater
surrounded
by
precipices
as
lofty
as
those
of
the
yosemite
these
cliffs
are
covered
with
masses
of
trees
shrubs
and
graceful
feathery
ferns
which
are
veiled
in
turn
by
the
mists
from
a
thousand
waterfalls
at
the
head
of
the
valley
stands
the
needle

entirely
of
the
huge
extinct
volcano

this
the
largest
extinct
volcano
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
lifts
its
enormous
crater
twenty
miles
in
circumference
to
the
height
of
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
some
titanic
eruption
blew
off
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
scooped
it
out
to
the
depth
of
two
thousand
feet
from
the
bottom
of
this
vast
cavity
rise
many
cones
the
largest
a
hill
of
seven
hundred
feet
and
there
are
two
great
gaps
in
the
walls
through
which
lava
flows
once
made
their
way
down
to
the
plain
here
and
there
on
the
desert
that
forms
the
floor
of
the
crater
are
scattered
clumps
of
silversword
with
long
leaves
shining
in
the
sun
this
plant
grows
only
at
a
high
altitude
hunting
for
it
is
like
hunting
for

nearest
botanical

is
found
in
the
himalaya
mountains
from
the
highest
point
of

are
said
to
appear
about

the
most
beautiful

the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean

with
glorious
palms

seem
eager

the
salt

their
heads
far
out
over
it
as
if
they
would
drink
it
up
as
it
is
on
the
windward
side
of
the
island
the
trade
winds
bring
hilo
a
yearly
rainfall
of
inches
and
the
result
is
seen
in
the
luxuriance
of
the
vegetation
which
nearly
hides
the
buildings
of
the
little
city
in
its
depths

dense

in
the
rear

situation
of

is
glorious
in
its
beauty
illustration
silversword
in
bloom
in
the
crater
of
haleakala
on
the
trail
to
the
crater
we
passed
first
between
the
brakes
of
cane
plantations
then
through
a
fine
tropical
forest
among
the
trees
we
could
see
many
gay
and
beautiful
flowers
curious
fruits
and
enormous
tree
ferns
while
in
the
interior
were
lovely
glades
and
the
little
bungalows
of
the
coffee
planters
but
the
island
was
only
just
being
developed
so
there
were
numbers
of
ranches
in
the
first
stages
of
raw
newness
a
search
through
the
forests
on
some
of
the
islands
would
disclose
the
beautifully
coloured
landshells
these
exquisite
little
creatures
grow
on
the
leaves
of
the
trees
many
of
the
native
birds
have
become
extinct
there
were
originally
seventy
varieties

have
been
introduced
from

china
and
from
other
countries
both
north

south
including
wild

pheasants
and
ducks
we
arrived
at
the
crater
late
at
night
to
find
only
a
miserable
hotel
with
a
drunken
proprietor
liars
had
told
us
it
was
good
we
were
forced
to
pass
the
night
there
but
stayed
the
next
day
only
long
enough
to
visit
the
crater
kilauea
was
for
us
a
great
disappointment
it
is
not
imposing
in
its
situation
lying
low
on
the
gradual
slope
of
mauna
loa
we
had
been
thrilled
by
pictures
of
the
great
pit
of
halemaumau
the
house
of
everlasting
fire
we
had
read
of
fountains
of
fire
thrown
a
thousand
feet
into
the
air
of
great
fissures
from
which
burst
clouds
of
deadly
sulphurous
vapours
of
indescribable
terrors
as
huge
billows
of
glowing
lava
surged
against
the
rim
of
the
pit
of
changing
colours
marvelous
beauty
of
ropes
and
serpents
of
cooling
rock
in
a
myriad
writhing
and
contorted
shapes
of
raging
floods
pouring
down
to
the
plain
in
rivers
of
fire
from
to
two
miles
in
width
but
alas
none
of
these
wonders
were
for
us
we
saw
only
a
lake
of
cold
black
lava
over
which
we
could
walk
for
miles
as
safe
as
if
we
were
at
home
out
of
a
pit
in
the
center
rose
a
column
of
white
vapour
which
did
not
even
smell
infernal
pele
was
sleeping
we
had
three
days
to
wait
in
hilo
until
our
steamer
should
be
ready
to
return
to
honolulu
the
hotel
was
a
funny
little
one
near
the
sea
but
we
were
fairly
comfortable
and
amused
ourselves
in
various
ways
for
one
thing
we
tried
several
of
the
delicious
tropical
fruits
that
were
to
be
had
here
mangoes
papayas
mountain
apples
and
guavas
we
went
on
a
picnic
and
some
one
was
kind
enough
to
lend
me
a
riding
habit
and
a
pony
that
had
won
some
races
i
rode
astride
in
native
fashion
this
was
my
first
but
by
no
means
my
last
experience
of
this
most
natural
and
comfortable
mode
of
riding
then
i
had
an
old
native
woman
to
me
hawaiian
for
massage
as
i
was
very
lame
from
my
long
rides
and
i
was
as
much
amused
by
her
as
benefited
by

treatment

we
decided
this
was
our
opportunity
to
see
a
hula
and
asked
the
coachman
at
the
hotel
to
make
arrangements
for
us
at
a
native
house
as
part
of
the
preparations
he
gave
the
performers
some
wine
so
the
dance
was
in
full
swing
when
we
arrived
they
had
made
leis
which
they
put
on
us
and
also
on
themselves
a
fat
but
good
looking
native
woman
in
a
holoku
danced
while
some
others
played
another
pretty
native
woman
said
she
was
dying
to
dance
but
her
husband
a
white
man
was
not
willing
and
the
last
time
she
did
it
he
beat
her
so
she
did
not
dare
to
try
again
it
was
a
strange
scene

dim

the
wild
suggestive
dance

trip
back

only

if

inclined
to
be

pessimistic
over

fate

perhaps
a
piece
of
recent
news
from

may
encourage
us
japan
has
just
passed
a
law
permitting
japanese
to
become
american
citizens
as
nearly
half
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
islands
are
japanese
and
japanese
children
are
born
there
in
a
year
this
is
an
interesting
consideration
when
difficulties
between
japan
and
america
are
talked
of
the
citizens
association
was
organized
by
a
few
japanese
who
are
citizens
by
right
of
birth
and
has
grown
to
a
membership
of
more
than
fifteen
hundred
it
takes
an
interest
in

discusses
the
questions
of

teaches
young

the
principles
and
duties
of
good

rev
sokabe
of
honolulu
gives
its
members
the
following
advice
japanese
have
a
great
mission
the
japanese
of
hawaii
must
become
the
pacificators
should
trouble
come
between
japan
and
america
you
owe
it
to
yourselves
to
do
this
learn
to
be
good
american
citizens
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
help
in
case
of
trouble
you
can
do
more
to
keep
peace
than
ambassadors
and
ministers
if
trouble
should
come
with
japan
you
must
remember
that
you
are
the
sons
of
the
president
not
the
sons
of
the
emperor
under
the
old
japanese
law
japanese
born
in
hawaii
were
still
subjects
of
japan
under
the
law
lately
enacted
by
the
diet
and
house
of
peers
of
japan
which
went
into
effect
june
all
japanese
born
in
a
foreign
country
have
the
right
at
the
age
of
fifteen
to
decide
whether
they
will
become
subjects
of
japan
or
of
the
country
of
their
birth
they
must
however
first
get
the
consent
of
their
parents
before
giving
up
their
citizenship
in
japan
patriotic
americans
should
no
longer
think
of
hawaii
as
she
was
eighteen
years
ago
at
the
time
of
annexation
then
the
japanese
labourer
on
the
sugar
plantations
was
an
alien
and
now
he
is
a
factor
and
his
children
a
greater
factor
in
the
american
civilization
of
the
pacific
moreover
to
show
how
american
and
patriotic
most
of
the
islanders
are
i

an
account
of
the

of

when
a

took

it
included
the
military

naval
forces
of
the

as
well
as
hawaiians
chinese
and

all
helping
to
make
it
a

of

on

dressed
in

followed
by

on

and
others
in
the
old

lay
very
realistically
dead
behind
their
guns
as
evening
came
on
the
japanese
people
began
to
assemble
in
the
park
down
in
the
oriental
quarter
and
from
there
marched
to
the
palace

then
past
the

american
battleships
at
the
docks
where
they
gave
their
for
the
sailors
and
were
given
in
return
a
hearty
american
three
cheers
showing
the
good
feeling
between
the
two
countries
in
view
of
the
strategic
value
of
the
islands
which
for
more
than
fifty
years
american
naval
officers
have
endeavoured
to
impress
upon
our
government
it
is
pleasant
to
learn
of
the
loyalty
and
americanism
of
the
people
of
hawaii
if
oahu
guam
and
the
panama
canal
are
well
fortified
and
sufficient
numbers
of
troops
and
warships
are
stationed
at
these
posts
they
will
protect
our
pacific
coast
better
than
any
number
of
harbour
defenses
and
now
with
the
banzai
of
these
newest
americans
ringing
in
our
ears
we
must
say
our
to
these
dream
islands
almost
too
perfect
to
be
real
we
say
farewell
but
the
spell
of
hawaii
will
always
be
upon

fortunate

we
were
at

going
to
see
the
interesting
results
of
spanish

for
three
centuries
upon
which
were
being
grafted
all
the
energy

social
knowledge
of
the

both
hawaii
and
the
philippines
are
under
american

they
are
like
different

the

a
much
bigger

for
the

than
hawaii
the
latter

are
malaysian

have
had
centuries
of
spanish
influence
the

clamour
for

the

be
carefully
handled

one
hundred
and

difficulties
are
to
be
considered

facts
in

we
looked
forward
to
interesting

in

we
were
not
disappointed

were

reached

was
massed
with
the
people
who
had
landed
from

and
with
crowds
from
the

at
once

the

the

and
the

were
whirled
off
in
autos
with
a
squadron
of
cavalry
clattering
along
as
escort
another
motor
was
waiting
for
us
and
we
soon
joined
the
procession
as
it
moved
to
the
palace
we
were
much
interested
in
the
sights
in
the
streets
there
were
numbers
of
little
covered
carriages
drawn
by
stocky
filipino
ponies
the
streets
in
this
part
of
the
town
are
wide
and
the
houses
have
overhanging
balconies
in
spanish
style
in
honour
of
the
secretary
the
buildings
were
draped
with
flags
near
the
wharf
the
land
had
lately
been
filled
in
and
great
docks
were
in
construction
there
was
a
new
boulevard
near
the
old
luneta
and
an
avenue
named
after
president
taft
besides
a
big
hotel
and
a
hospital
that
had
then
just
been
finished
the
harbour
was
filled
with
vessels
electric
cars
were
running
and
autos
were
to
be
seen
so
at
first
it
all
looked
quite
up
to
date
until
you
met
a
carabao
slowly
swaying
down
the
street
hitched
to
a
cart
with
a
brown
boy
in
red
trousers
shirt
and
a
big
straw
hat
sitting
on
his
back
carry
boy
as
secretary
dickinson
named
the
animal
the
carry
boys
do
not
like
white
people
and
sometimes
charge
them
stamping
and
goring
them
with
their
horns
but
a
small
filipino
boy
seems
to
have
perfect
control
of
them
and
if
they
are
allowed
occasionally
to
wade
in
a
puddle
which
cools
them
off
they
do
not
go
or
crazy
it
was
in
the

of
malacañan

house
as
it
is
sometimes
called
that

in

by

under

entered
a
stone
hall
off
which
were
offices
then
went
up
a
long
flight
of
stairs
to
a
big
hall
looking
into
a
court
this
hall
was
hung
with
oil
paintings
of
spanish
governors
quite
well
done
by
native
artists
and
in
the
center
stood
a
huge
table
of
superb
wood
covered
with
gleaming
and
spears
and
used
by
the
wild
tribes

moros
our
rooms
were
large
and
empty
as
was
the
entire
palace
indeed
so
are
all
the
houses
on
account
of
the
heat
the
polished
floors
too
are
made
of
huge
planks
sometimes
of
such
valuable
tropical
woods
as
rosewood
and
mahogany
and
are
left
bare

took
a
little
time
to
accustom
ourselves
to
the
hard
beds
with
rattan
bottoms
covered
only
by
two
sheets
they
were
carved
and
and
draped
with
mosquito
netting
two
little
brown
lizards
squeaked
at
us
in
a
friendly
manner
and
crept
down
the
walls
out
of
curiosity
no
doubt
little
ants
kept
busily
crawling
across
the
room
in
a
line
and
the
mosquitoes
that
hid
in
my
clothes
in
the
rack
during
the
daytime
buzzed
about
at
night
the
heat
was
great
notwithstanding
the
electric
fan
but
the
sliding
screens
that
formed
the
sides
of
the
room
gave
us
some
relief
these
shutters
are
like
japanese
made
of
small
panes

an
opalescent

soften
the
intensity

tropic
sunlight

bamboo
shades
pulled
halfway
down
when
i
used
to

sat
on

i
could
look

rapidly
through

were
loaded
to

these
are
really
inferior
compared
with
those
we
saw
in

but
some
of
them
are
very
old

is
the

we
visited
the
botanical
gardens
a
shaded
park
with
winding
paths
beneath
acacias
and
mango
trees
we
drove
too
through
the
narrow
streets
of
the
suburb
of
san
miguel
where
we
looked
into
tangled
gardens
of
tropical
plants
behind
which
were
houses
with
broad
verandas
and
sides
covered
by
a
wonderful
screen
of
a
sort
of
mauve
morning
glory
which
blooms

long
the
native
houses
are
built
of
bamboo
with
braided

walls
and

and
are
raised
on

because
of
the
rainy
season
we
went
to
order
some
embroidery
one
day
of
a
tagalog
woman
climbing
a
ladder
into
a
small
house
we
saw
the
whole
family
sitting
on
the
floor
working
over
a
long
frame
in
some
of
these
shacks
they
have
a
small
room
for
visitors
with
chairs
and
a
table
and
cheap
prints
of
the
virgin
on
the
walls
under
the
house
are
kept
usually
a
pig
and
a

one
woman
was
very
successful
she
not
only
had
waist
patterns
to
show
and
to
sell
but
had
a
standing
order
from
marshall
field
in
chicago
we
also
visited
a
still
more
prosperous
embroidery
house
built
of
stucco
with
a
courtyard

people
were

visit
to
the
cigarette
factory
to
which
we
were
taken
by
legarda
showed
us
one
of
the
characteristic
industries
of
the
city
and
gave
us
an
idea
of
the
deftness
and
quickness
of
those
who
are
employed
in
this
work
the
little
women
who
pack
the
cigarettes
can
pick
up
a
number
of
them
and
tell
in
a
twinkle
by
the
feeling
just
how
many
they
hold
and
the
cigar
wrappers
work
with
greatest
rapidity
and
sureness
and
make
a
perfect
product
it
was
all
very
clean
and
fresh
with
hundreds
of
employees
in
the
large
airy
rooms
a
band
played
as
we
went
through
the
building
and
we
had
a
generous
luncheon
and
received
innumerable
presents
from
the
managers
opportunity
was
given
us
for

little
exploring
trips

among
little
native
shacks
through

lanes
beyond

we
saw

and
men
mending
their
nets
to
the

club
the
governor
who
was
most
generous
in
giving
money
of
his
own
to
benefit
the
islands
not
only
built
the
clubhouse
and
laid
out
the
field
at
his
own
expense
but
even
imported
arabian
horses
and
good
western
ponies
this
club
is
a
fine
thing
to
keep
army
officers
in
good
condition
and
give
them
exercise
and
amusement
as
well
as
to
bring
good
horses
into
the
islands
the
clubhouse
of
plaited
grasses
bamboo
and
wood
is
on
the
edge
of
the
beach
from
which
one
can
see
the
beautiful
sunsets
across
the
bay
and
catch
the
faint
line
of
the
mountains
in
the
distance
it
all
seemed
very
and
tropical
and
enchanting
the
residents
of
manila
have
various
other
clubs
among
which
the
army
and
navy
the
english
and
the
university
are
perhaps
the
most
important

officers
club
at
fort
mckinley
seven
miles
from
manila
has
a
superb
situation
commanding
a
fine
view
of
the
mountains
as
we
landed
in
manila
early
sunday
morning
we
were
in
time
for
service
in
the
episcopal
cathedral
which
had
just
been
built
this
is
a
handsome
building
in
the
spanish
style
large
and
airy
with
an
effective
altar
it
was
erected
by
an
american
friend
of
bishop
brent
the
episcopal
bishop
who
has
done
fine
work
in
the
islands
according
to
a
story
that
is
related
of
this
good
man
he
made
a
journey
at
one
time
into
the
interior
of
luzon
where
he
found
the
natives
sadly
in
need
of
instruction
in
ways
of
personal
cleanliness
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
mail
service
again
he
wrote
to
america
for
a
ton
of
soap
which
was
duly
shipped
to
him
and
used
for
the
purification
of
the
aborigines
i
was
glad
to
visit
also
bishop
brent
orphan
school
consisting
principally
of
children
the
native
women
when
deserted
by
their
white
lovers
generally
marry
natives
who
often
these
children
and
sometimes
sell
them
as
slaves
miss
sibley
of
detroit
was
in
charge
of
this
school
which
was
in
a
big
comfortable
house
near
the
native
shacks
on
the
edge
of
the
town
and
had
twelve
pupils
at
that
time
a
convent
of
spanish
nuns
on
a
small
island
in
the
river
interested
me
greatly
it
was
then
under
the
supervision
of
the
government
for
it
was
at
that
time
not
only
a
convent
but
also
a
poorhouse
a
school
for
orphans
an
asylum
for
insane
men
and
women
and
a
reformatory
for
bad
boys
the
embroidery
done
at
the
convent
was
better
than
that
made
by
the
natives
in
their
houses
as
the
thread
used
was
finer
the
nuns
charged
more
than
the
natives
but
they
would
also
cut
and
sew
thus
finishing
the
garments
articles
embroidered
by
native
women
were
never
made
up
by
them
but
had
to
be
taken
to
a
chinese
tailor
the
linen
must
first
be
bought
however
so
i
tried
to
do
a
little
shopping
in
the
city
but
found
it
very
unsatisfactory
the
shops
are
poor
and
as
one
traveler
has
said
you
can
get
nothing
you
want
in
them
but
plenty
of
things
you
do
want
for
which
you
can
pay
a
very
high
price
one
day
i
was
taken
to
a
cockpit
where
a
cockfight
was
to
come
off
this
is
one
of
the
characteristic
amusements
of
the
filipinos
which
they
have
engaged
in
since
the
year
it
is
so
popular
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
put
a
stop
to
it
all
at
once
but
it
has
been
restricted
by
the
government
to
sundays
and
legal
holidays
which
is
something
of
a
victory
they
are
also
passionately
fond
of
horse
racing
in
regard
to
which
other
restrictions
have
been
made
outside
beggars
old
and
blind
were
crawling
over
the
ground
natives
strolled
around
petting
their
birds
which
they
carried
under
their
arms
and
vendors
with
dirty
trays
of
sweetmeats
wandered
about
we
bought
our
tickets
and
passed
into
the
rickety
amphitheater
cocks
were
crowing
and
such
a
howling
as
went
on
the
audience
all
looking
toward
us
as
we
entered
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
angry
with
us
for
stepping
into
the
arena
and
yet
there
was
no
other
way
to
reach
the
seats
our
guides
pointed
to
a
shaky
ladder
that
led
into
a
gallery
but
we
preferred
to
sit
far
back
in
the
chairs
about
the
pit
there
were
natives
chinese
and
mestizos
present
we
soon
discovered
that
they
were
not
angry
with
us
but
we
had
entered
at
a
moment
when
the
betting
was
going
on
and
the
cocks
in
the
ring
were
so
popular
that
there
was
great
excitement
each
cock
was
allowed
to
peck
the
neck
of
the
other
and
get
a
taste
of
blood
while
they
were
still
held
under
their
owners
arms
the
fighting
cocks
did
not
look
quite
like
ours
they
were
armed
for
the
fray
with
sharp
slashers
attached
to
their
spurs
when
the
betting
had
subsided
the
cocks
were
left
to
themselves
in
the
ring
and
they
generally
went
for
each
other
at
once
what
a
hopping
and
scuttling
feathers
flew
the
crowd
cheered
and
the
cocks
went
at
each
other
again
and
again
until
they
were
hurt
or
killed
the
referee
then
decided
upon
the
victor
sometimes
the
cocks
did
not
seem
to
interest
the
crowd
and
then
their
owners
would
take
them
out
of
the
ring
before
fighting
at
times
the
cocks
refused
to
fight
it
was
not
so
exciting
as
i
had
expected
and
when
we
considered
that
the
birds
were
to
be
eaten
anyway
it
did
not
seem
so
cruel
and
terrible
as
i
thought
it
would
speaking
of
cocks
being
eaten
the
principal
foods
of
the
filipinos
are
fowls
and
eggs
as
well
as
rice
fish
and
carabao
meat
but
as
the
are
good
workers
they
are
not
often
eaten
pigs
are
kept
by
the
filipinos
and
are
put
on
a
raised
platform
for
about
six
weeks
before
killing
so
as
to
keep
them
clean
and
fatten
them
with
good
food
salads
crawfish
and
trout
as
well
as
cocoanut
milk
red
wine
and
wild
coffee
are
among
the
things
they
live
on
army
people
in
the
islands
often
have
in
addition
wild
deer
and
wild
boar
which
are
shot
by
the
american
officers
besides
excellent
game
birds
such
as
the
minor
bustard

fowl
wild
chicken
quail
snipe

malacañan
palace
i
was
asked
to
receive
with
the
secretary
and
dickinson
and
general
and
edwards
at
the
governor
general
reception
at
malacañan
where
we
stood
in
line
and
shook
hands
with
some
seventeen
hundred
persons
it
was
a
remarkable
scene
the
palace
which
opens
up
handsomely
and
the
terrace
overhanging
the
river
were
outlined
by
a
myriad
electric
lights
while
launches
came
and
went
with
guests
and
the
philippine
constabulary
band
played
in
the
interior
court
the
papal
delegate
was
there
in
his
canonicals
with
his
accompanying
monsignors
and
barefooted
friars
in
cowls
there
were
foreign
consuls
in
their
uniforms
and
many
filipina
women
with
pretty
manners
and
dainty
ways
some
in
their
native
dress
which
is
so
quaint
and
gaily
coloured
insurrecto
generals
came
too
who
looked
like
young
boys
and
members
of
the
high
courts
very
wise
and
dignified
after
most
of
the
guests
had
arrived
there
was
a
of
honour
in
which
all
took
part
the
rigodon
is
the
dance
of
the
filipinos
and
of
so
much
importance
to
them
that
it
was
considered
essential
that
the
secretary
and
his
party
should
be
able
to
join
in
it
accordingly
we
had
all
practised
it
on
the
ship
before
reaching
manila
it
is
said
that
taft
won
much
of
his
way
into
the
hearts
of
these
island
people
by
his
skill
and
evident
delight
in
this
dance
which
is
something
like
a
graceful
and
dignified
quadrille
with
much
movement
and
turning
to
show
that
traveling
in
an
official
party
is
not
all
play
and
no
work
i
may
just
note
the
program
carried
out
by
the
men
on
the
day
following
this
reception
rising
at
six
and
taking
an
early
breakfast
they
went
on
board
the
commanding
general
yacht
and
cruised
across
manila
bay
to
visit
the
new
defenses
on
the
island
of
corregidor
which
rises
a
sheer
five
hundred
feet
out
of
the
water
for
hours
they
moved
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
heat
inspecting
huge
guns
and
mortars
and
barracks
and
storehouses
all
hidden
away
so
as
not
to
be
seen
from
the
sea
although
great
gashes
in
the
cliffs
showed
where
the
trolley
roads
and
the
inclined
planes
ran
it
is
really
the
key
to
our
possessions
in
the
far
east
thousands
of
men
were
working
like
ants
all
over
the
place
it
was
two
before
the
party
reached
the
where
they
had
a
luncheon
at
the
quarters
of
the
commanding
officer
then
they
came
back
to
the
yacht
and
fairly
tumbled
down
just
wherever
they
happened
to
be
for
a
siesta
they
were
then
taken
to
cavite
ten
miles
away
which
is
one
of
the
two
naval
stations
there
they
landed
again
and
visited
the
picturesque
old
spanish
fortifications

quarters

a
or
ball
was
given
in
honour
of
the
secretary
by
the
philippine
assembly
at
their
official
building
where
all
the
ladies
of
our
party
wore
the
filipina
dress
this
is
ordinarily
made
of
piña
cloth
a
cheap
gauzy
material
manufactured
from
pineapple
fiber
the
waist
called
is
made
with
winglike
sleeves
and
a
stiff
collar
named
the
skirt
may
be
of
any
material
quite
often
a
handsome
brocade
and
among
the
tagalogs
a
black
silk
apron
finishes
the
costume
the
white
suits
and
uniforms
of
the
men
and
the
dresses
made
this
ball
a
gay
and
lively
scene
the
band
played
incessantly
and
after
the
secretary
and
dickinson
had
stopped
receiving
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
there
was
a
rigodon
which
we
all
danced
in
as
stately
a
manner
as
we
could
but
my
most
vivid
recollection
of
the
ball
is
of
the
heat
and
the
pink
lemonade
which
poisoned
a
hundred
people
and
made
me
deadly
ill
all
that
night
the
governor
general
gave
a
big
dinner
for
the
secretary
of
war
at
the
palace
one
evening
we
assisted
also
at
the
opening
of
the
new
theater
which
is
called
the
finest
in
the
far
east
at
which
marshall
darrach
gave
recitations
from
shakespeare
i
must
not
forget
the
gala
performance
at
the
new
theater
too
which
was
arranged
by
the
society
people
of
the
city
all
the
performers
were
amateurs
so
we
rather
dreaded
the
evening
which
promised
to
be
interminable
but
everything
was
so
good
that
the
time
passed
quickly
the
little
ladies
sang
quite
acceptably
and
played
the
violin
and
the
piano
and
a
lot
of
tiny
tots
children
of
the
best
people
gave
an
amusing
vaudeville
that
really
was
exceedingly
funny
and
was
much
applauded
we
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
all
amateur
the
government
dormitory
for
girls
which
we
visited
i
found
most
interesting
there
were
one
hundred
and
fifty
eight
sleeping
in
each
room
these
girls
came
from
different
provinces
all
over
the
islands
as
there
are
so
many
distinct
dialects
some
of
them
could
understand
one
another
only
in
english
and
no
other
language
is
allowed
to
be
spoken
one
of
the
girls
made
a
speech
in
english
welcoming
the
secretary
and
did
it
extremely
well
having
learned
among
other
things
to
cook
they
gave
us
delicious
tea
and
cakes
and
candies
on
a
veranda
among
the
vines
and
japanese
lanterns
some
were
taking
the
nurses
course
which
seemed
to
be
the
most
popular
these
pretty
girls
danced
for
us
in
their
stiff
costumes
swaying
and
waving
their
hands
and
turning
and
twirling
in
their
languid
but
dignified
manner
it
appeared
to
be
a
mixture
of
a
spanish
and
a
native
dance
and
was
altogether
quite
charming
a
morning
with
worcester
at
the
bureau
of
science
was
most
delightful
this
bureau
is
so
much
more
than
a
museum
of
scientific
specimens
that
i
can
not
begin
to
do
justice
to
it
in
a
single
paragraph
it
was
started
at
first
as
a
bureau
of
government
laboratories
in
charge
of
the
chemical
and
biological
work
of
the
government
the
departments
of
zoölogical
and
botanical
research
were
subsequently
added
and
finally
the
bureau
of
ethnology
and
the
bureau
of
mines
were
incorporated
with
it
not
only
were
all
these
departments
coördinated
under
one
head
preventing
overlapping
and
securing
economy
and
efficiency
of
administration
but
this
work
was
correlated
with
that
of
the
philippine
general
hospital
and
the
college
of
medicine
and
surgery
when
this
comprehensive
plan
was
formed
all
the
scientific
work
of
the
government
was
carried
on
in
a
hot
little
shack
and
the
scheme
was
commonly
referred
to
as
worcester
dream
but
at
the
time
of
our
visit
the
dream
had
come
true
the
departments
were
manned
by
thoroughly
trained
men
from
the
states
and
the
bureau
of
science
was
one
of
the
world
greatest
scientific
institutions
the
philippine
bureau
of
science
is
now
dead
when
the
democratic
administration
took
charge
it
was
announced
that
all
theoretical
departments
such
as
ethnology
botany
ornithology
photography
and
entomology
were
to
be
reduced
or
eliminated
it
was
afterward
made
plain
that
all
work
which
was
considered
practical
would
be
continued
but
the
mischief
had
been
done
the
men
who
made
the
institution
had
left
and
under
present
conditions
it
is
impossible
to
secure
others
who
are
equally
competent
in
their
place
our
only
consolation
is
to
be
derived
as
worcester
himself
says
from
contemplating
the
fact
that
pendulums
swing
though
so
recently
established
the
museum
contained
in
a
wonderful
exhibit
of
the
plants
and
animals
of
the
islands
we
took
a
peep
into
the
butterfly
room
where
we
admired
some
rare
and
lovely
ones
with
a
feathery
velvet
sheen
the
colour
of
the
sea
we
saw
also
the
huge
brown
atlas
moth
touched
with
coral
like
a
cashmere
shawl
with
eyes
of
on
his
wings
we
noticed
that
the
females
were
larger
than
the
males
and
even
those
of
the
same
variety
often
differed
greatly
in
colour
in
one
case
a
female
was
big
and
brown
and
violet
in
colour
while
her
mate
was
small
and
blue
and
yellow
in
the
next
room
were
beetles
some
of
which
were
like
the
matrix
of
turquoise
and
others
had
shimmering
changeable
shades
of
green
and
bronze
there
were
beetles
like
small
turtles
and
long
horned
beetles
like
miniature
carabaos
afterward
we
visited
the
birds
sun
birds
with
long
beaks
which
feed
on
the
honey
of
flowers
clever
tailor
birds
small
and
brown
with
green
heads
and
gray
breasts
which
sew
leaves
together
with
vegetable
fiber
to
make
their
nests
birds
of
whose
nests
the
chinese
make
their
famous
soup
and
the
blue
kingfishers
of
whose
brilliant
feathers
these
same
chinese
make
jewelry
birds
too
and
birds
there
were
birds
that
build
their
nest
four
feet
or
more
under
the
ground
and
hornbills
that
wall
up
their
wives
in
holes
in
the
trees
while
they
are
hatching
their
eggs
the
males
bringing
them
food
and
dropping
it
through
a
small
opening
there
too
i
saw
the
fairy
bluebird
near
by
we
visited
an
orchid
garden
and
passed
under
gates
and
bamboo
trellises
dripping
with
every
kind
of
orchid
the
philippines
are
the
paradise
of
these
remarkable
plants
and
many
are
the
adventures
that
collectors
of
them
have
had
in
the
interior
of
these
islands
then
we
passed
into
the
jesuit
chapel
and
museum
we
were
greeted
at
the
door
by
several
priests
who
smiled
and
bowed
and
talked
all
at
once
they
escorted
us
first
to
the
museum
where
there
were
cases
of
shells
shells
trumpet
shells
scalloped
shells
big
enough
for
a
bathtub
all
kinds
of
shells
and
the
paper
nautilus
which
is
not
a
shell
but
an
egg
case
then
there
were
land
shells
polished
red
and
green
venus
flower
baskets
exquisite
glass
sponges
corals
of
all
kinds
fine
branches
of
the
red
and
the
white
and
an
enormous
turtle
that
weighed
fifteen
hundred
pounds
in
the
cases
at
the
side
of
the
room
were
animals
of
the
country
flying
monkeys
with
sucking
pads
on
their
toes
to
help
them
climb
the
trees
big
furry
bats
and
flying
lizards
a
tiny
buffalo
which
was
discovered
only
a
few
years
ago
up
in
the
hills
and
a
small
spotted
deer
were
in
the
collection
a
big
eagle
white
and
brown
was
here
and
the
paroquet
that
carries
leaves
for
her
nest
in
her
red
tail
as
well
as
a
pigeon
with
ruffs
of
green
and
blue
about
her
neck
and
a
bald
crown
which
was
caused
the
natives
say
by
flying
so
high
that
her
head
hit
the
sky
numerous
entertainments
and
receptions
were
crowded
into
that
too
short
visit
to
manila
july
had
been
declared
a
national
holiday
a
musical
program
was
given
in
honour
of
the
secretary
by
five
thousand
manila
school
children
one
afternoon
dickinson
received
some
of
the
filipina
ladies
who
sang
and
played
on
the
piano
quite
well
another
day
the
officers
and
ladies
at
fort
mckinley
entertained
the
party
at
luncheon
at
the
officers
club
before
luncheon
there
was
a
military
review
in
which
the
troops
from
all
over
the
islands
participated
followed
by
some
good
shell
firing
out
in
the
chaparral
as
under
war
conditions
and
a
display
of
wireless
work
a
special
drill
was
given
by
captain
tom
anderson
the
son
of
general
anderson
whose
company
was
one
of
the
best
drilled
in
the
army
and
went
through
the
manual
and
marching
with
only
one
order
given
counting
to
themselves
in
silence
the
whole
seventeen
hundred
counts
all
in
perfect
unison
in
the
secretary
of
war
speech
that
afternoon
he
took
occasion
to
say
general
duvall
you
have
not
said
too
much
in
favour
of
the
army
you
have
not
overdrawn
the
picture
for
a
steadier
moving
column
or
brighter
eyed
men
and
a
more
soldierly
set
of
men
i
have
never
seen
anywhere
the
reception
by
general
and
duvall
was
a
brilliant
affair
chiefly
of
the
army
and
navy
the
handsome
house
with
its
wide
verandas
stood
in
a
garden
overlooking
manila
bay
on
the
luneta
there
was
one
evening
the
largest
gathering
that
had
assembled
on
that
historic
plaza
since
the
days
of
the
empire
for
the
secretary
of
war
was
expected
to
be
there
the
people
hoped
that
he
brought
with
him
a
proclamation
of
immediate
independence
to
be
announced
at
that
time
the
luneta
had
once
been
at
the
edge
of
the
water
but
a
great
space
had
been
filled
in
beyond
it
and
buildings
were
going
up
a
large
hotel
which
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
tourist
travel
in
the
philippines
and
a
huge
army
and
navy
club
so
that
it
was
planned
to
remove
the
luneta
farther
out
some
day
again
to
the
water
edge
on
this
particular
evening
the
oval
park
was
crowded
with
picturesque
people
almost
all
the
men
in
white
the
soldiers
in
their
trig
khaki
and
the
women
in
their
gaily
coloured
dresses
and
panuelas
rows
of
carriages
circled
round
and
round
as
the
two
bands
played
alternately
after
a
time
we
left
our
automobiles
and
walked
in
the
throng
a
magnificent
sunset
was
followed
by
the
gorgeous
tints
of
the
afterglow
and
dusk
came
on
and
evening
fell
while
we
watched
and
were
watched
soon
a
thousand
electric
lights
that
were
carried
in
rows
around
the
plaza
and
over
the
kiosks
of
the
bands
sparkled
out
in
the
darkness
the
beauty
of
the
scene
the
animation
of
the
crowd
driving
or
walking
in
groups
and
the
refreshing
coolness
after
the
heat
of
the
day
made
this
a
lasting
memory
chapter
ii
the
philippines
of
the
past
how
have
the
philippines
come
to
present
such
a
unique
combination
of
spanish
and
malay
civilization
let
us
look
into
their
past
we
find
for
the
early
days
myths
and
legends
preserved
by
oral
tradition
two
quaint
stories
told
by
the
primitive
mountain
people
which
show
how
they
believe
the
islands
first
came
into
being
and
how
the
first
man
and
woman
entered
into
this
world
are
worth
transcribing
for
their
naïve
simplicity
a
long
time
ago
there
was
no
land
there
were
only
the
sea
and
the
sky
a
bird
was
flying
in
the
sky
it
grew
tired
flying
it
wanted
something
to
rest
upon
the
bird
was
very
cunning
it
set
the
sea
and
sky
to
quarreling
the
sea
threw
water
up
at
the
sky
the
sky
turned
very
dark
and
angry
then
the
angry
sky
showered
down
upon
the
sea
all
the
islands
that
is
how
the
islands
came
this
second
tale
is
even
more
a
great
bamboo
grew
on
one
of
the
islands
it
was
very
large
around
larger
than
any
of
the
others
the
bird
lit
on
the
ground
and
began
to
peck
the
bamboo
a
voice
inside
said
harder
peck
harder
the
bird
was
frightened
at
first
but
it
wanted
to
know
what
was
inside
so
it
pecked
and
pecked
still
the
voice
said
harder
peck
harder
at
last
a
great
crack
split
the
bamboo
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
out
stepped
a
man
and
a
woman
the
bird
was
so
frightened
that
it
flew
away
the
man
bowed
very
low
to
the
woman
for
they
had
lived
in
different
joints
of
the
bamboo
and
had
never
seen
each
other
before
they
were
the
first
man
and
woman
in
the
world
these
natives
believe
there
are
good
and
evil
spirits
and
they
invoke
the
agency
of
the
latter
to
explain
the
mystery
of
death
they
say
the
first
death
occurred
when
the
evil
spirit
lightning
became
angry
with
man
and
hurled
a
dangerous
bolt
to
earth
the
first
suggestion
of
real
history
is
found
in
the
traditions
that
tell
of
malays
from
the
south
who
came
and
settled
on
these
islands
it
is
said
a
race
of
small
black
people
were
already
here
the
negritos
who
resembled
the
african
negroes
and
who
retired
into
the
hills
before
the
invaders
next
we
hear
of
a
mohammedan
priest
who
came
to
the
southern
philippines
and
gave
the
people
his
religion
his
followers
have
to
this
day
been
called
moros
it
was
more
than
two
centuries
before
captain
cook
visited
hawaii
that
white
men
discovered
the
philippines
magellan
the
famous
portuguese
navigator
while
sailing
in
the
service
of
spain
landed
on
mindanao
and
cebu
and
took
possession
of
the
group
in
the
name
of
the
spanish
king
before
starting
from
seville
on
this
voyage
around
the
world
magellan
had
already
spent
seven
years
in
india
and
sailed
as
far
as
sumatra
so
he
already
knew
this
part
of
the
world
this
time
he
was
in
search
of
the
spice
islands
and
of
a
passage
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
ocean
he
had
touched
first
at
teneriffe
and
then
crossed
the
atlantic
to
brazil
making
his
way
along
the
coast
of
south
america
there
were
many
hardships
and
difficulties
to
contend
with
and
mutiny
in
the
fleet
resulted
in
several
deaths
but
as
we
all
know
he
persevered
and
on
the
of
october
discovered
the
straits
which
were
named
after
him
the
ladrones
were
reached
after
fourteen
tedious
weeks
and
on
lazarus
day
in
the
philippines
were
sighted
and
named
by
him
for
the
saint
in
the
early
times
they
were
sometimes
referred
to
by
the
spaniards
as
the
eastern
and
later
as
the
western
islands
they
were
finally
named
the
philippines
by
ruy
lopez
de
villalobos
after
his
king
philip
the
second
magellan
was
quite
unlike
captain
cook
whose
visit
to
hawaii
has
been
mentioned
he
was
a
nobleman
and
full
of
the
religious
enthusiasm
that
fired
the
spaniards
of
his
day
he
was
accompanied
by
several
friars
who
at
once
began
missionary
work
among
the
natives
and
only
a
week
after
his
arrival
the
cebuan
chief
and
his
warriors
were
baptized
into
the
christian
faith
unfortunately
magellan
took
sides
with
the
cebuans
in
their
warfare
against
a
neighbouring
tribe
and
in
the
battle
he
was
killed
after
his
death
the
same
chieftain
turned
on
followers
but
some
escaped
to
their
ships
out
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
who
had
set
sail
three
years
before
only
eighteen
after
suffering
incredible
hardships
on
the
long
journey
by
way
of
india
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
returned
safely
to
spain
the
next
explorer
who
touched
at
the
islands
was
the
englishman
sir
francis
drake
of
spanish
armada
fame
who
sailed
in
on
a
voyage
round
the
world
we
also
hear
of
another
briton
william
dampier
a
noted
who
in
tried
to
cross
the
isthmus
of
panama
with
captain
sharp
three
times
he
sailed
round
the
world
and
touched
at
the
northern
as
well
as
the
southern
philippine
islands
magellan
drake
and
dampier
gave
the
western
world
much
knowledge
of
the
far
east
but
did
not
remain
long
enough
in
the
islands
to
have
any
great
or
lasting
influence
over
the
natives
the
work
of
civilizing
them
was
left
to
legaspi
and
the
spanish
friars
who
were
the
first
real
settlers
in
the
philippines
were
occupied
by
an
expedition
under
miguel
lopez
de
legaspi
of
the
city
of
mexico
who
was
charged
to
open
a
new
route
to
java
and
the
southern
islands
on
his
return
voyage
he
was
to
examine
the
ports
of
the
philippines
and
if
expedient
to
found
a
colony
there
in
any
case
he
was
to
establish
trade
with
the
islands
the
viceroy
of
mexico
charged
him
that
the
friars
with
the
expedition
were
to
be
treated
with
the
utmost
consideration
since
you
are
aware
that
the
chief
thing
sought
after
by
his
majesty
is
the
increase
of
our
holy
catholic
faith
and
the
salvation
of
the
souls
of
those
infidels
cebu
was
occupied
and
manila
was
taken
and
made
the
seat
of
government
the
occupation
of
the
islands
was
not
exactly
by
force
of
arms
for
there
was
no
fighting
although
they
found
the
islands
well
populated
and
the
people
more
or
less
armed
the
natives
seemed
to
recognize
and
submit
to
a
better
government
and
religion
than
they
had
ever
known
the
reports
of
the
spaniards
of
the
time
speak
of
the
success
of
small
expeditions
of
perhaps
a
hundred
men
who
took
over
whole
provinces
these
soldiers
were
accompanied
by
spanish
priests
who
settled
among
the
people
preaching
christianity
in
the
native
tongues
the
friars
persuaded
them
to
give
up
their
continual
feuds
and
submit
to
the
central
authority
which
the
friars
represented
legaspi
brought
with
him
from
mexico
four
hundred
spanish
soldiers
later
eight
hundred
more
arrived
and
civilian
spaniards
both
married
and
single
sailed
to
the
islands
as
settlers
in
according
to
the
records
of
spanish
grants
there
were
natives
under
spanish
rule
and
officials
to
enforce
the
laws
and
preserve
order
it
was
reported
that
in
a
majority
of
the
grants
there
was
peace
justice
and
religious
instruction
there
were
augustinian
dominican
and
franciscan
friars
as
well
as
secular
clergy
these
men
were
not
only
priests
but
also
fighters
and
organizers
and
did
fine
work
for
many
years
until
possession
of
power
gradually
made
the
orders
corrupt
and
grasping
upon
their
first
arrival
the
spaniards
found
the
people
established
in
small
villages
or
where
the
chief
lived
surrounded
by
his
slaves
and
followers
it
was
considered
wise
to
continue
this
system
ruling
the
villages
through
the
local
chieftain
whom
the
spaniards
called
de
churches
were
erected
convent
houses
were
built
about
them
and
the
natives
were
urged
to
gather
near
by
it
was
ordered
that
elementary
schools
should
be
established
in
which
the
indians
will
be
taught
not
only
christian
doctrine
and
reading
and
writing
but
also
arts
and
trades
so
that
they
may
become
not
only
good
christians
but
also
useful
citizens
so
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
philippines
were
at
peace
the
natives
were
allowed
to
move
from
one
town
to
another
but
they
were
required
to
obtain
permission
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
wandering
about
without
religious
instruction
the
tendency
of
the
malays
is
to
separate
into
small
groups
and
they
have
never
been
dwellers
in
large
towns
the
spanish
priests
therefore
found
a
constant
effort
necessary
to
keep
them
concentrated
about
the
churches
under
the
bells
illustration
under
the
bells
the
fervour
of
religious
reform
which
started
in
germany
was
followed
by
an
equal
fervour
within
the
roman
catholic
church
the
period
of
julius
ii
and
leo
x
was
over
the
council
of
trent
had
met
ignatius
loyola
had
seen
his
visions
and
sent
forth
his
company
and
spain
was
full
of
priests
eager
to
serve
god
with
the
same
stern
energy
which
the
previous
generation
had
shown
in
the
search
for
lands
and
gold
and
fabulous
gems
no
duty
was
so
grave
as
that
of
conformity
to
the
church
no
stigma
so
galling
as
that
of
heretic
to
convert
the
heathen
was
an
obligation
binding
upon
all
men
all
spanish
colonies
were
missions
the
philippines
were
always
rather
a
mission
than
a
colony
until
the
revolt
of
spain
never
found
it
necessary
to
hold
the
islands
by
armed
force
her
dominion
there
was
based
rather
on
her
conquest
of
the
minds
and
souls
of
men
there
had
been
a
few
uprisings
however
and
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
spanish
governor
and
his
son
were
murdered
by
a
mob
but
notwithstanding
occasional
difficulties
in
the
main
there
was
peace
until
the
civil
service
of
the
philippines
was
assimilated
with
that
of
spain
then
officials
became
dependent
upon
their
supporters
at
home
and
were
changed
with
every
change
of
the
ministry
some
spaniard
writing
at
the
time
said
that
with
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
spanish
office
holders
descended
on
the
islands
like
locusts
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
spanish
army
had
grown
to
of
all
ranks
only
of
whom
were
spaniards
and
there
was
a
constabulary
of
over
officers
and
men
who
were
almost
entirely
natives
the
rule
of
spain
was
secured
by
a
native
army
there
could
have
been
no
widespread
discontent
or
that
army
would
not
have
remained
true
to
its
allegiance
especially
as
its
recruits
were
obtained
by
conscription
the
chronicles
remind
us
however
that
the
spaniards
did
not
have
things
all
their
own
way
in
the
early
days
they
were
at
first
friendly
with
the
chinese
and
mexico
carried
on
a
flourishing
trade
with
china
by
way
of
manila
until
the
pirate
li
ma
hong
raided
the
islands
the
spaniards
were
on
good
terms
with
the
japanese
until
the
latter
massacred
the
jesuit
friars
in
japan
when
the
shogun
iyeyasu
expelled
the
priests
he
sent
away
even
those
who
were
caring
for
the
lepers
and
as
a
final
insult
he
sent
to
manila
three
junks
loaded
with
lepers
with
a
letter
to
the
governor
general
of
the
philippines
in
which
he
said
that
as
the
spanish
friars
were
so
anxious
to
provide
for
the
poor
and
needy
he
sent
him
a
cargo
of
men
who
were
in
truth
sore
afflicted
only
the
ardent
appeals
of
the
friars
saved
these
unfortunates
and
their
contaminated
vessels
from
being
sunk
in
manila
bay
finally
the
governor
yielded
and
these
poor
creatures
were
landed
and
housed
in
the
leper
hospital
of
san
lazaro
which
was
then
established
for
their
reception
and
which
remains
the
spanish
governors
were
also
hampered
by
the
lack
of
effective
support
from
the
older
colony
of
mexico
which
was
so
much
nearer
than
the
home
land
that
they
naturally
turned
to
it
for
aid
one
of
them
wrote
pathetically
to
the
king
of
spain
and
for
the
future
will
your
majesty
ordain
that
mexico
shall
furnish
what
pertains
to
its
part
for
if
i
ask
for
troops
they
send
me
twenty
men
who
die
before
they
arrive
here
and
none
are
born
here
and
if
i
ask
for
ammunition
they
laugh
at
me
and
censure
me
and
say
that
i
ask
impossible
things
they
retain
there
the
freight
money
and
the
duties
and
if
they
should
send
to
this
state
what
is
yours
your
majesty
would
have
to
spend
but
little
from
your
royal
patrimony
the
portuguese
were
a
source
of
anxiety
to
the
colonists
until
portugal
fell
into
the
hands
of
spain
the
dutch
too
who
were
growing
powerful
in
the
far
east
even
took
formosa
which
brought
them
altogether
too
near
but
they
were
driven
out
of
that
island
by
the
great
chinese
pirate
koxinga
from
the
time
of
legaspi
to
the
end
of
spanish
rule
there
were
occasional
attacks
upon
the
chinese
residing
in
the
archipelago
who
were
never
allowed
to
live
in
the
islands
without
exciting
protest
and
dislike
based
partly
upon
religious
partly
upon
commercial
grounds
during
the
last
one
hundred
years
of
spanish
supremacy
the
greatest
danger
to
their
power
was
the
presence
of
the
chinese
efforts
to
exclude
them
were
never
effective
or
long
enduring
and
yet
it
was
felt
that
the
men
who
came
as
labourers
and
traders
were
the
advance
guard
of
an
innumerable
host
in
business
the
malay
has
never
been
the
equal
of
the
shrewd
chinaman
and
although
the
latter
might
be
converted
and
take
a
spanish
name
yet
it
was
always
gravely
suspected
that
a
search
would
find
joss
sticks
smoldering
in
front
of
the
tutelary
deity
of
commerce
hidden
behind
the
image
of
the
virgin
in
his
chapel
so
the
chinaman
like
the
jew
in
medieval
europe
carried
on
his
trade
in
constant
danger
of
robbery
and
murder
this
antipathy
did
not
however
extend
to
filipina
women
many
of
whom
married
the
foreigners
among
the
leaders
in
the
filipino
insurrection
against
the
united
states
aguinaldo
two
of
his
cabinet
nine
of
his
generals
and
many
of
his
more
important
financial
agents
were
of
chinese
descent
in
the
english
swooped
down
upon
manila
but
they
held
the
capital
only
two
years
for
by
the
treaty
of
paris
the
lands
they
had
taken
were
returned
to
spain
it
is
said
the
english
conquest
brief
as
it
was
brought
good
results
to
the
islands
before
going
on
to
the
struggle
against
the
friars
i
wish
to
quote
from
my
father
letters
describing
his
experiences
in
the
philippines
twenty
years
before
american
occupation
at
sea
december
yesterday
i
left
manila
where
i
have
been
since
the
of
last
month
our
first
days
there
were
spent
in
firing
salutes
and
exchanging
visits
and
going
through
all
the
forms
which
are
customary
when
a
government
vessel
comes
into
a
foreign
port
admiral
patterson
sent
me
here
to
settle
a
stabbing
affray
on
board
the
american
barque
and
that
took
up
my
attention
at
first
in
the
evenings
i
went
to
the
opera
and
visited
the
sights
of
the
city
on
account
of
earthquakes
all
the
buildings
are
but
one
story
high
the
customs
fashions
are
spanish
every
one
was
polite
and
i
found
it
very
pleasant
but
as
you
might
expect
after
a
little
while
i
grew
restless
i
heard
that
there
was
some
beautiful
scenery
in
the
interior
and
i
resolved
to
go
on
an
investigating
trip
and
see
it
our
yongs
and
another
gentleman
went
with
me
from
manila
we
went
in
a
boat
up
a
short
river
which
had
its
rise
in
a
large
lake
about
miles
long
that
we
crossed
in
a
steamer
i
think
i
never
saw
such
quantities
of
two
things
as
were
on
that
lake
namely
ducks
and
mosquitoes
from
the
lake
we
continued
our
journey
in
vehicles
like
the
of
havana
and
in
these
we
went
from
village
to
village
on
our
way
to
the
mountains
we
were
very
well
treated
the
spanish
authorities
at
manila
provided
us
with
whatever
we
required
the
villages
were
clusters
of
thatched
huts
around
a
church
and
the
religion
seemed
to
be
a
curious
mixture
of
roman
catholic
christianity
and
pagan
superstition
as
i
concluded
from
the
style
of
the
pictures
with
which
the
churches
were
adorned
these
were
chiefly
representations
of
hell
and
its
torments
devils
with
the
traditional
tails
and
horns
and
armed
with
pitchforks
were
turning
over
sinners
in
lakes
of
burning
brimstone
we
found
the
natives
very
musical
they
sang
and
played
on
a
variety
of
instruments
and
they
were
rather
handsome
the
women
had
without
exception
the
longest
and
most
luxuriant
hair
i
ever
saw
in
all
my
travels
you
know
it
is
a
rare
thing
among
us
for
a
woman
to
have
hair
that
sweeps
the
ground
but
here
the
exception
is
the
other
way
nearly
every
woman
i
saw
had
hair
between
five
and
six
feet
in
length
i
was
told
that
back
among
the
mountains
there
existed
tribes
whom
the
spaniards
have
never
been
able
to
conquer
and
no
one
dares
to
venture
among
them
not
even
the
priests
our
road
was
constantly
ascending
and
as
we
advanced
toward
the
interior
the
scenery
became
beautiful
peaks
of
mountains
rose
all
about
us
plains
and
valleys
stretched
out
covered
with
tropical
vegetation
picturesque
villages
clustering
around
their
churches
were
visible
here
and
there
and
in
the
distance
were
glimpses
of
the
sea
sparkling
and
bright
in
the
sun
i
was
told
of
a
wonderful
ravine
among
the
mountains
that
was
worth
seeing
and
i
decided
to
visit
it
especially
as
it
was
a
favourable
time
the
river
by
which
it
had
to
be
approached
was
then
high
and
its
fifteen
cascades
which
usually
had
to
be
climbed
past
dragging
the
canoe
were
reduced
to
four
i
took
three
natives
with
me
and
we
ascended
successfully
i
have
called
it
a
ravine
but
a
gorge
would
be
a
better
term
for
it
is
worn
directly
through
the
mountain
by
a
large
river
and
the
rock
rises
up
on
each
side
as
sheer
and
straight
as
if
cut
by
machinery
after
i
had
ascended
a
certain
distance
i
stopped
for
a
time
to
examine
all
the
wild
magnificence
about
me
the
rocky
wall
on
each
side
was
so
high
that
when
i
looked
up
i
could
see
the
stars
shining
in
that
bright
noonday
as
if
it
were
night
huge
birds
came
flapping
up
the
gorge
far
above
my
head
and
yet
they
were
far
below
the
top
of
the
mountain
of
rock
i
do
not
know
how
many
feet
it
rose
but
i
never
saw
any
precipice
where
the
impression
of
height
was
so
effectually
given
it
seemed
immense
beneath
us
was
the
deep
broad
stream
looking
very
dark
in
the
twilight
that
such
a
shadow
made
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
awestruck
but
the
opening
of
the
gorge
framed
as
smiling
and
cheerful
a
landscape
as
could
possibly
be
devised
to
contrast
with
the
inner
gloom
it
was
a
wide
varied
and
splendid
view
of
the
country
beyond
sloping
to
the
distant
sea
and
all
of
it
as
aglow
with
light
and
colour
as
sea
and
land
could
be
beneath
a
tropic
sun
descending
the
river
on
our
way
out
i
had
a
characteristic
adventure
which
will
make
me
satisfied
for
a
time
we
had
passed
two
of
the
rapids
in
safety
but
as
we
approached
the
third
the
canoe
struck
on
a
rock
or
something
in
the
current
bow
on
and
swinging
round
half
filled
with
water
the
natives
in
the
end
of
the
canoe
nearest
the
rock
sprang
out
and
clung
to
the
vines
which
hung
over
its
sides
but
the
other
man
and
i
went
over
the
fall
in
the
canoe
and
were
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
the
stream
with
an
unusually
good
prospect
of
getting
a
good
deal
more
of
it
the
fall
once
passed
through
the
current
drove
us
toward
the
shore
if
that
is
what
you
would
call
a
precipice
of
rock
running
straight
down
far
below
the
surface
of
the
water
i
succeeded
in
grasping
the
vines
and
pulling
the
canoe
after
me
by
my
feet
the
water
was
quite
close
by
the
rock
and
the
other
two
men
crawling
down
to
us
hung
on
with
me
and
bailed
out
the
boat
till
it
was
safely
afloat
and
then
we
went
down
the
rest
of
the
way
without
accident
before
the
middle
of
the
last
century
life
in
the
philippines
must
have
been
for
spaniards
and
natives
alike
one
long
period
of
siesta
the
sound
of
the
wars
and
the
passing
of
governments
and
kings
in
europe
must
have
seemed
to
these
loiterers
in
a
summer
garden
like
the
drone
of
distant
bees
after
that
period
conditions
changed
rapidly
in
the
jesuits
returned
to
the
philippines
in
the
reactionary
queen
isabella
ii
fled
from
spain
because
of
the
rise
of
republicanism
in
the
suez
canal
was
opened
all
these
events
had
their
influence
but
the
return
of
the
jesuits
was
of
dominating
importance
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
the
sole
idea
of
the
tagals
was
to
get
rid
of
the
friars
and
for
several
reasons
which
i
will
explain
as
briefly
as
possible
the
roman
catholic
clergy
are
divided
into
regular
and
secular
members
of
the
secular
clergy
are
subordinate
to
the
bishops
and
archbishops
through
whom
the
decrees
of
the
holy
see
are
promulgated
the
regular
clergy
monks
and
friars
are
subordinate
to
provincials
elected
for
comparatively
short
terms
of
office
by
members
of
their
own
order
the
jesuits
form
a
group
by
themselves
but
belong
rather
to
the
regular
than
the
secular
over
three
hundred
years
after
the
conversion
of
the
filipinos
the
spanish
monks
and
friars
considered
it
still
unsafe
to
admit
natives
into
the
hierarchy
of
the
catholic
church
secular
clergy
were
mostly
natives
the
regular
clergy
were
naturally
this
condition
of
affairs
in
time
produced
friction
to
understand
the
case
in
regard
to
the
jesuits
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
nearly
a
century
in
the
king
of
spain
issued
a
decree
expelling
the
jesuits
from
his
possessions
their
property
was
confiscated
their
schools
were
closed
and
they
were
treated
as
enemies
of
the
state
they
had
been
among
the
earliest
missionaries
in
the
philippines
and
were
probably
the
wealthiest
and
most
influential
of
all
the
clergy
there
their
departure
left
no
priests
for
the
richest
parishes
in
the
provinces
of
cavite
and
manila
which
had
been
their
sphere
of
influence
the
question
at
once
arose
as
to
who
would
succeed
them
and
as
it
happened
the
archbishop
of
manila
who
had
to
answer
it
was
a
member
of
the
secular
clergy
a
spanish
priest
to
be
sure
but
of
liberal
tendencies
consequently
he
filled
the
parishes
with
native
priests
who
continued
to
occupy
them
until
the
return
of
the
jesuits
now
the
parish
priest
was
the
most
influential
man
in
the
community
as
native
priests
used
this
influence
to
build
up
the
prestige
of
the
seculars
the
ecclesiastical
feuds
which
arose
became
embittered
by
racial
antagonism
when
a
royal
order
was
received
permitting
the
return
of
the
jesuits
it
became
at
once
necessary
to
find
places
for
them
in
the
ecclesiastical
government
spain
decided
that
the
parishes
of
cavite
and
manila
should
be
henceforth
filled
by
members
of
the
order
of
recollets
who
were
to
transfer
their
missions
in
mindanao
to
the
jesuits
the
archbishop
protested
against
this
increase
in
the
power
of
the
regular
clergy
and
the
governor
general
assembled
his
council
to
act
upon
the
protest
all
the
members
of
the
council
who
were
born
in
spain
voted
against
the
archbishop
all
those
born
in
the
philippines
voted
for
him
the
regulars
gained
another
victory
over
the
seculars
the
native
was
publicly
informed
that
he
was
not
fit
to
administer
the
parishes
of
his
own
people
and
he
saw
himself
definitely
assigned
to
the
position
of
lay
brother
or
of
curate
whatever
threads
of
attachment
there
had
been
between
the
opposing
factions
broke
on
the
day
of
that
decision
and
every
native
priest
from
that
moment
became
a
center
of
disaffection
and
of
the
propaganda
of
hatred
of
the
friars
this
was
perhaps
the
real
beginning
of
the
movement
which
continued
now
secretly
now
openly
until
it
broke
out
in
actual
revolt
in
the
spaniards
put
down
this
uprising
of
the
tagalogs
with
such
cruelty
that
they
feared
a
later
retaliation
and
sought
help
from
the
friars
this
the
friars
gave
them
in
return
for
added
wealth
and
power
which
was
granted
of
course
at
the
expense
of
the
vanquished
natives
worcester
writes
in
one
of
his
earlier
books
during
the
years
while
traveling
in
the
archipelago
i
everywhere
heard
the
mutterings
that
go
before
a
storm
it
was
the
old
story
compulsory
military
service
taxes
too
heavy
to
be
borne
and
imprisonment
or
deportation
with
confiscation
of
property
for
those
who
could
not
pay
them
no
justice
except
for
those
who
could
afford
to
buy
it
cruel
extortion
by
the
friars
in
the
more
secluded
districts
wives
and
daughters
ruined
the
marriage
ceremony
too
costly
a
luxury
for
the
poor
the
dead
refused
burial
without
payment
of
a
substantial
sum
in
advance
no
opportunity
for
education
little
encouragement
for
industry
and
economy
since
to
acquire
wealth
meant
to
become
a
target
for
officials
and
friars
alike
these
and
a
hundred
other
wrongs
had
goaded
the
natives
and
until
they
were
stung
to
desperation
the
dissensions
in
the
philippines
which
ended
in
the
rebellion
of
began
with
disagreements
among
the
spaniards
themselves
a
progressive
party
arose
before
which
the
clerical
or
conservative
party
slowly
but
steadily
lost
ground
and
the
legislation
of
modern
spain
was
by
degrees
introduced
into
the
islands
the
country
was
not
able
to
endure
the
taxation
which
would
have
been
necessary
to
raise
the
revenues
to
carry
out
this
legislation
hence
laws
which
were
passed
against
the
advice
of
the
spanish
clergy
in
the
philippines
were
left
largely
in
their
hands
for
execution
not
because
they
were
loved
or
trusted
but
because
they
were
the
only
spanish
functionaries
who
knew
the
language
and
the
people
and
whose
residence
in
the
islands
was
a
permanent
one
if
the
friars
had
used
their
power
wisely
and
unselfishly
there
would
have
been
no
trouble
but
they
used
it
too
often
simply
to
keep
the
people
down
and
extort
money
for
which
they
gave
little
return
by
degrees
the
mestizos
took
sides
the
chinese
mestizos
soon
grew
restive
under
this
priestly
government
and
aided
the
progressive
spanish
party
in
manila
as
time
passed
they
had
it
borne
in
upon
them
that
revolution
might
pay
the
insurrection
of
was
planned
and
carried
out
under
the
auspices
of
a
society
local
to
the
philippines
called
the
katipunan
the
full
title
of
which
may
be
translated
as
supreme
select
association
of
the
sons
of
the
people
according
to
spanish
writers
on
the
subject
it
was
the
outgrowth
of
a
series
of
associations
of
freemasons
formed
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
securing
reforms
in
the
government
of
the
philippines
but
whose
unexpressed
and
ultimate
object
was
to
obtain
the
independence
of
the
archipelago
as
if
to
accomplish
this
purpose
a
systematic
attack
was
made
on
the
monastic
orders
in
the
philippines
to
undermine
their
prestige
and
to
destroy
their
influence
upon
the
great
mass
of
the
population
the
honorary
president
of
the
katipunan
was
josé
rizal
whose
name
was
used
without
his
permission
to
attract
the
masses
to
the
movement
rizal
was
born
in
not
far
from
manila
he
came
of
intelligent
stock
after
his
early
training
at
the
jesuit
school
in
manila
and
the
dominican
university
rizal
went
to
spain
where
he
took
high
honors
at
the
university
of
madrid
in
medicine
and
philosophy
work
in
france
and
germany
followed
he
was
an
ardent
patriot
and
in
order
to
awaken
his
countrymen
to
the
need
of
reform
although
he
was
a
roman
catholic
he
published
while
in
germany
his
book
called
noli
me
tangere
touch
me
not
which
dealt
with
the
immoral
life
of
the
friars
an
english
translation
has
been
issued
with
the
title
the
social
cancer
the
circulation
of
the
book
in
the
islands
was
forbidden
but
it
was
read
by
most
of
the
educated
filipinos
in
reading
it
one
is
again
and
again
struck
by
the
clear
comprehension
of
the
needs
and
the
difficulties
of
the
filipinos
and
the
calm
unprejudiced
way
in
which
their
problems
are
discussed

the
trick
was
successful
and
he
returned
to
manila
where
he
was
soon
arrested
and
banished
to
the
island
of
mindanao
the
most
powerful
leader
of
the
insurrection
was
andres
bonifacio
a
passionate
and
courageous
man
of
little
education
he
sent
an
agent
to
rizal
to
aid
him
in
escaping
from
his
place
of
exile
and
to
request
him
to
lead
the
katipunan
in
open
revolt
rizal
refused
believing
that
the
filipinos
were
not
yet
ready
for
independence
bonifacio
resolved
to
proceed
without
him
bonifacio
assured
his
audience
that
when
he
gave
the
signal
the
native
troops
would
join
them
it
was
of
great
importance
to
the
success
of
his
plan
that
the
army
as
in
was
engaged
in
operations
against
the
moros
there
were
available
in
manila
only
some
three
hundred
spanish
artillery
detachments
amounting
to
four
hundred
men
including
seamen
and
two
thousand
native
soldiers
the
plot
was
discovered
but
bonifacio
escaped
from
manila
and
sent
out
orders
for
an
uprising
in
that
part
of
luzon
which
had
been
organized
by
the
katipunan
manila
was
attacked
but
the
rebels
were
repulsed
martial
law
was
proclaimed
in
eight
provinces
of
luzon
followed
by
wholesale
executions
many
of
those
arrested
on
suspicion
were
confined
in
fort
santiago
one
batch
being
crowded
into
a
dungeon
for
which
the
only
ventilation
was
a
grated
opening
at
the
top
and
one
night
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
carelessly
spread
his
over
this
so
the
next
morning
some
asphyxiated
corpses
were
hauled
away
just
before
the
outbreak
rizal
received
permission
to
join
the
army
in
cuba
as
surgeon
but
on
the
way
there
was
arrested
and
brought
back
to
manila
his
fate
was
now
sealed
the
trial
by
was
a
farce
on
a
december
day
in
he
was
led
to
execution
rizal
was
undoubtedly
the
noblest
and
most
unselfish
of
the
filipino
leaders
and
his
execution
was
not
only
a
crime
but
a
blunder
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
authorities
from
his
prison
he
issued
an
address
to
the
filipinos
remarkable
for
its
moderation
and
its
condemnation
of
the
savage
rebellion
stating
that
the
education
of
the
people
must
precede
any
truly
beneficial
reforms
and
urging
them
to
go
back
to
their
homes
the
spanish
officials
deemed
this
not
sufficiently
patriotic
to
be
published
and
sentenced
its
author
to
the
death
of
a
traitor
by
shooting
in
the
back
he
is
the
national
hero
of
the
filipinos
illustration
fort
santiago
the
seacoast
towns
were
under
the
leadership
of
emilio
aguinaldo
a
young
radical
who
was
already
a
recognized
leader
among
the
local
disaffected
the
spaniards
had
not
expected
this
outbreak
in
cavite
aguinaldo
had
personally
assured
the
governor
of
the
province
of
his
devotion
to
spain
but
when
fighting
began
isolated
spanish
officers
were
killed
and
their
families
carried
into
captivity
the
difficulties
of
the
spaniards
were
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
defense
of
manila
and
cavite
until
reinforcements
arrived
would
be
largely
in
the
hands
of
native
troops
among
whom
the
katipunan
was
known
to
have
been
at
work
but
the
troops
of
the
old
native
regiments
the
men
who
for
years
had
followed
spanish
officers
were
on
the
whole
faithful
and
it
was
largely
due
to
them
that
manila
and
cavite
were
held
the
leaders
in
the
insurrection
were
of
that
class
who
called
themselves
enlightened
a
class
whose
blood
is
in
almost
every
case
partly
spanish
or
partly
chinese
the
supremacy
of
the
friars
was
passing
and
men
of
this
class
intended
to
be
the
heirs
to
their
domain
the
idea
of
forming
a
republic
and
even
of
adopting
the
titles
appropriate
to
a
republic
to
designate
the
functionaries
of
a
malay
despotism
was
an
afterthought
reinforcements
arrived
from
spain
and
by
june
the
insurrection
was
broken
and
aguinaldo
with
his
remaining
adherents
had
taken
refuge
at
biacnabato
some
sixty
miles
from
manila
he
was
now
without
a
rival
for
bonifacio
had
dared
to
attempt
his
life
had
been
brought
before
a
had
been
condemned
to
death
and
had
disappeared
aguinaldo
who
now
called
himself
not
only
generalissimo
of
the
army
of
liberation
but
president
of
the
revolutionary
government
had
adopted
guerilla
warfare
and
the
spanish
commands
were
forced
to
follow
an
enemy
who
was
never
dangerous
to
large
bodies
but
who
always
was
to
small
ones
an
enemy
who
wearing
no
uniform
upon
the
approach
of
a
large
body
became
peaceful
labourers
in
the
fields
along
the
road
but
were
ready
to
pick
up
their
rifles
or
bolos
and
use
them
against
a
small
party
or
a
straggler
still
whatever
they
had
fought
for
at
first
the
insurgent
leaders
were
now
fighting
for
their
own
safety
the
governor
general
sought
in
various
ways
to
gain
the
support
of
the
country
he
called
for
filipino
volunteers
and
curiously
enough
they
responded
with
enthusiasm
the
rapidity
with
which
they
were
recruited
was
probably
largely
due
to
the
activity
of
the
friars
this
added
to
the
hatred
of
them
felt
by
the
class
of
natives
represented
by
aguinaldo
between
june
and
december
the
time
was
spent
in
an
obscure
bargaining
the
outcome
of
which
was
the
treaty
of
biacnabato
which
primo
de
rivera
the
governor
general
has
stated
was
merely
a
promise
to
pay
a
money
bribe
to
the
insurgents
if
they
would
cease
a
combat
in
which
they
had
lost
hope
of
success
but
which
they
could
still
prolong
to
the
detriment
of
the
resources
and
the
prestige
of
spain
the
result
of
the
bargainings
was
that
spain
agreed
to
pay
eight
hundred
thousand
mexican
dollars
for
the
surrender
of
aguinaldo
and
his
principal
leaders
and
the
arms
and
ammunition
in
their
possession
an
amnesty
was
proclaimed
aguinaldo
and
his
leaders
were
sent
to
hongkong
under
escort
where
they
declared
themselves
loyal
spanish
subjects
primo
de
rivera
returned
to
spain
as
he
received
in
return
for
the
money
only
about
two
hundred
rifles
and
a
little
ammunition
it
is
not
probable
that
he
made
any
of
the
promises
of
changes
in
the
government
of
the
archipelago
which
the
filipinos
have
insistently
stated
since
then
were
the
real
objects
of
the
agreement
whatever
may
have
been
the
true
motives
which
actuated
the
spanish
governor
general
in
adopting
this
method
of
terminating
a
successful
campaign
he
succeeded
in
purchasing
only
an
armistice
and
not
a
peace
on
january
a
te
deum
was
sung
in
the
cathedral
of
manila
to
mark
the
reëstablishment
of
peace
in
the
archipelago
the
insurgent
leaders
had
been
bought
off
and
their
followers
had
surrendered
their
arms
as
spanish
dominion
in
the
philippines
was
now
about
to
close
let
us
stop
a
moment
to
inquire
what
it
had
brought
to
the
islands
it
may
have
been
hard
and
utterly
unprogressive
but
it
turned
the
tribes
of
luzon
and
the
visayas
from
tribal
feuds
and
expeditions
to
agriculture
to
accomplish
these
results
required
untiring
energy
and
a
high
enthusiasm
among
the
missionaries
they
had
lived
among
savages
speaking
their
tongue
until
they
had
almost
forgotten
their
own
spain
had
ceased
to
be
everything
to
them
their
order
was
their
country
spanish
officials
came
and
went
but
the
ministers
of
the
church
remained
and
as
they
grew
to
be
the
interpreters
of
the
wants
of
the
people
in
many
cases
their
protectors
against
spoliation
power
fell
into
their
hands
it
is
rather
interesting
to
learn
that
in
in
the
reign
of
philip
iii
it
was
proposed
to
abandon
the
philippines
on
account
of
their
useless
expense
to
spain
but
a
delegation
of
friars
from
the
islands
implored
him
not
to
abandon
the
twenty
thousand
christians
they
had
converted
and
the
order
was
countermanded
spanish
dominion
left
the
people
christians
whereas
if
the
islands
had
not
been
occupied
by
spain
their
people
would
in
all
probability
be
mohammedan
the
point
of
view
of
the
spanish
friars
may
not
be
ours
but
when
their
efforts
are
judged
by
the
good
rather
than
the
evil
results
it
can
still
be
said
that
spain
gave
christianity
and
a
long
term
of
peace
to
the
philippine
archipelago
the
filipinos
are
the
only
christian
asiatics
but
philippine
history
was
to
take
an
unexpected
turn
the
war
broke
out
and
a
new
factor
appeared
upon
the
scene
in
the
shape
of
commodore
dewey
and
his
fleet
we
all
know
the
story
of
the
battle
of
manila
bay
but
we
may
just
recall
it
briefly
it
was
the
night
of
april
that
the
american
asiatic
squadron
which
had
received
its
orders
at
hongkong
arrived
off
the
philippines
they
took
a
look
first
into
subig
bay
but
seeing
no
enemy
they
made
their
way
into
manila
bay
by
the
boca
grande
entrance
there
were
rumours
of
mines
in
the
channel
and
big
guns
in
the
forts
but
dewey
took
the
chance
and
the
fleet
steamed
in
at
night
the
ships
formed
two
columns
the
fighting
ships
all
in
one
line
and
the
auxiliary
vessels
about
twelve
hundred
yards
behind
they
moved
at
the
rate
of
their
slowest
vessel
black
thunder
clouds
at
times
obscured
even
the
crescent
moon
that
partially
lighted
their
course
but
occasional
lightning
flashes
gave
the
bold
americans
a
glimpse
of
frowning
corregidor
and
the
sentinel
rock
of
el
fraile
the
ships
were
dark
except
for
one
white
light
at
the
stern
of
each
as
a
guide
to
the
vessel
next
in
line
as
the
turned
toward
el
fraile
her
light
was
seen
by
a
spanish
sentry
a
sheet
of
flame
from
the
smokestack
of
the
a
revenue
cutter
attached
to
the
fleet
also
betrayed
its
presence
to
the
enemy
at
the
same
moment
el
fraile
and
a
battery
on
the
south
shore
of
the
bay
at
once
opened
fire
which
was
returned
by
the
ships
to
such
good
purpose
that
the
battery
was
silenced
in
three
minutes
slowly
steadily
dewey
ships
steamed
on
and
at
dawn
discovered
the
gray
spanish
vessels
lying
in
front
of
the
naval
arsenal
at
cavite
over
on
the
distant
shore
to
the
right
admiral
montojo
flagship
the
and
the
and
a
number
of
smaller
vessels
formed
a
curved
line
of
battle
which
was
protected
in
a
measure
by
the
shore
batteries
the
spaniards
had
one
more
ship
than
the
americans
but
the
latter
had
bigger
guns
silently
the
american
squadron
advanced
across
the
bay
with
the
stars
and
stripes
flying
from
every
ship
at
quarter
past
five
on
the
morning
of
may
the
spanish
ships
fired
their
first
shots
when
less
than
six
thousand
yards
from
their
line
dewey
gave
the
famous
order
to
captain
gridley
in
command
of
the
you
may
fire
when
ready
gridley
two
hours
later
the
had
been
burned
the
was
on
fire
and
all
but
one
of
the
other
spanish
vessels
were
abandoned
and
sunk
dewey
gave
his
men
time
for
breakfast
and
a
little
rest
then
shelled
and
silenced
the
batteries
at
cavite
soon
after
noon
the
spaniards
surrendered
having
lost
men
and
ten
war
vessels
seven
americans
were
slightly
wounded
but
none
were
killed
so
ended
this
famous
battle

insurrection
admiral
dewey
took
a
great
liking
to
general
anderson
fighting
tom
cousin
the
first
military
officer
to
command
the
american
forces
in
the
philippines
on
one
occasion
the
admiral
fired
a
salute
well
after
sundown
contrary
to
naval
regulations
to
compliment
him
on
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
major
general
and
scared
the
wits
out
of
some
of
the
good
people
ashore
general
anderson
has
given
me
a
few
notes
about
his
experiences
at
that
time
which
are
of
special
interest
when
in
the
latter
part
of
april
i
received
an
order
relieving
me
from
duty
in
alaska
and
ordering
me
to
the
philippines
i
was
engaged
in
rescuing
a
lot
of
people
who
had
been
buried
by
an
avalanche
in
the
chilcoot
pass
i
took
my
regiment
at
once
to
san
francisco
and
there
received
an
order
placing
me
in
command
of
the
first
military
expedition
to
the
philippines
this
was
the
first
american
army
that
ever
crossed
an
ocean
we
were
given
only
two
days
for
preparation
we
were
not
given
a
wagon
cart
ambulance
or
a
single
army
mule
nor
boats
with
which
to
land
our
men
i
received
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
silver
and
was
ordered
to
render
what
assistance
i
could
i
had
never
heard
of
aguinaldo
at
that
time
and
all
i
knew
of
the
philippines
was
that
they
were
famous
for
hemp
earthquakes
tropical
diseases
and
rebellion
we
stopped
at
honolulu
on
the
way
over
although
the
hawaiian
islands
had
not
been
annexed
the
kanakas
received
us
with
enthusiasm
and
assured
us
that
the
place
was
a
paradise
before
the
coming
of
the
missionaries
and
mosquitoes
from
there
we
went
to
guam
where
we
found
nude
natives
singing
long
and
dan
tucker
songs
they
had
learned
from
american
sailors
when
we
reached
cavite
the
last
day
of
june
admiral
dewey
asked
me
to
go
ashore
and
call
on
aguinaldo
who
he
assured
me
was
a
native
chief
of
great
influence
our
call
was
to
have
been
entirely
informal
but
when
we
approached
the
house
of
the
dictator
we
found
a
barefooted
band
in
full
blare
the
after
the
rule
of
the
country
being
the
leader
the
stairway
leading
to
aguinaldo
apartment
was
lined
on
either
side
by
a
strange
assortment
of
filipino
warriors
the
chief
himself
was
a
small
man
in
a
very
frock
coat
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
collapsible
opera
hat
i
saw
him
many
times
afterward
and
always
thus
provided
he
asked
me
at
once
if
i
could
recognize
his
assumption
this
i
could
not
do
so
when
a
few
days
later
i
invited
him
to
attend
our
first
fourth
of
july
he
declined
he
further
showed
his
displeasure
by
failing
to
be
present
at
the
first
dinner
to
which
we
american
officers
were
invited
there
for
the
first
time
we
met
filipina
ladies
they
were
bare
as
to
their
shoulders
yet
in
some
mysterious
way
their
dresses
remained
well
in
place
in
dancing
there
was
a
continuous
shuffling
on
the
floor
because
their
slippers
only
half
covered
their
light
fantastics
rendering
them
more
agile
than
graceful
in
returning
from
visiting
the
tagalog
chief
we
saw
a
headless
statue
of
columbus
i
asked
a
native
to
explain
how
christopher
had
lost
his
head
the
reply
was
that
they
beheaded
him
because
they
did
not
wish
to
be
discovered
soon
after
i
got
to
cavite
i
was
invited
with
the
officers
of
my
staff
to
attend
a
dinner
given
in
my
honour
at
the
symposium
i
was
asked
to
state
the
principles
upon
which
the
american
government
was
founded
i
answered
consent
of
the
governed
and
majority
rule
buencamino
the
toastmaster
replied
will
baptize
ourselves
to
that
sentiment
upon
which
he
emptied
his
champagne
glass
on
his
head
the
others
likewise
wasted
their
good
wine
illustration
a
group
of
filipina
ladies
when
general
merritt
arrived
he
first
came
ashore
at
a
village
behind
the
line
we
had
established
where
aguinaldo
was
making
his
headquarters
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
at
the
time
but
aguinaldo
who
must
have
known
of
the
presence
of
the
new
governor
general
failed
to
ask
him
to
take
shelter
in
his
headquarters
naturally
general
merritt
was
indignant
and
directed
that
thereafter
any
necessary
business
should
be
conducted
through
me
this
placed
me
in
a
very
disagreeable
position
at
first
i
thought
i
could
conciliate
and
use
the
filipinos
against
the
spaniards
but
general
merritt
brought
an
order
from
president
mckinley
directing
that
we
should
only
recognize
the
filipinos
as
rebellious
subjects
of
spain
aguinaldo
reproached
me
bitterly
for
my
change
of
conduct
toward
him
but
because
of
my
orders
i
could
not
do
otherwise
nor
could
i
explain
the
cause
we
soon
drifted
into
open
hostility
i
found
but
one
man
who
appeared
to
understand
the
situation
and
he
was
the
much
hated
archbishop
nozaleda
after
we
took
manila
he
invited
me
to
come
to
see
him
he
remarked
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
that
when
we
took
the
city
by
storm
he
expected
to
see
our
soldiers
kill
the
men
and
children
and
violate
the
women
but
instead
he
praised
us
for
having
maintained
perfect
order
for
reply
i
quoted
the
latin
subjectis
et
debellare
which
prompted
him
to
say
in
spanish
to
a
jesuit
priest
these
people
seem
to
be
civilized
to
which
the
jesuit
replied
we
have
some
colleges
in
their
country
the
statement
that
we
seemed
to
be
civilized
calls
for
an
explanation
i
found
many
filipinos
feared
american
rule
might
prove
more
severe
on
them
than
the
spanish
control
in
a
school
book
that
i
glanced
at
in
a
spanish
school
was
the
enlightening
statement
that
the
americans
were
a
cruel
people
who
had
exterminated
the
entire
indian
population
of
north
america
the
battle
of
manila
bay
was
fought
and
won
as
we
well
remember
on
may
day
through
the
kind
offices
of
the
british
consul
the
spanish
admiral
came
to
an
understanding
with
dewey
surgeons
were
sent
ashore
to
assist
in
the
care
of
the
wounded
spaniards
and
sailors
to
act
as
police
the
cable
was
cut
and
the
blockade
was
carried
into
effect
at
once
the
foreign
population
was
allowed
to
leave
for
china
german
kept
arriving
in
the
harbour
until
there
were
five
in
all
it
was
known
that
germany
sympathized
with
spain
and
only
the
timely
arrival
of
some
friendly
english
ships
and
the
trenchant
diplomacy
of
our
admiral
prevented
trouble
all
the
rest
of
that
month
and
the
next
and
still
the
next
the
fleet
lay
at
anchor
threatening
the
city
with
its
guns
but
making
no
effort
to
take
it
the
people
lived
in
constant
fear
of
bombardment
from
the
ships
which
they
could
so
plainly
see
from
the
luneta
on
their
evening
promenades
but
they
could
not
escape
for
aguinaldo
forces
lay
encamped
behind
them
in
the
suburbs
in
fact
the
refugees
were
seeking
safety
within
the
walls
of
the
city
instead
of
fleeing
from
it
for
while
they
had
no
love
for
the
spaniards
and
were
fellow
countrymen
of
the
rebel
chieftain
they
preferred
to
take
their
chances
of
bombardment
rather
than
risk
his
method
of
peaceful
occupation
of
course
there
was
no
coöperation
between
the
americans
and
the
filipinos
although
both
wanted
the
same
thing
and
each
played
somewhat
into
the
other
hand
admiral
dewey
refused
to
give
aguinaldo
any
naval
aid
and
the
on
at
least
two
occasions
found
it
profitable
to
betray
our
plans
to
the
common
enemy
the
delay
in
taking
the
city
was
caused
by
dewey
shortage
of
troops
he
could
have
taken
it
at
any
time
but
could
not
have
occupied
it
the
spanish
commander
made
little
attempt
at
defense
a
formal
attack
on
one
of
the
forts
satisfied
the
demands
of
honour
when
the
city
surrendered
on
august
the
americans
were
in
the
difficult
position
of
guarding
thirteen
thousand
spanish
soldiers
of
keeping
at
bay
some
fourteen
thousand
filipinos
and
of
policing
a
city
of
two
hundred
thousand
people
all
with
some
ten
thousand
men
the
way
in
which
it
was
accomplished
is
in
effective
contrast
with
european
methods
when
our
troops
broke
the
line
of
trenches
encircling
manila
they
pressed
quickly
forward
through
the
residence
district
to
the
old
walled
town
which
housed
the
governmental
departments
of
the
city
here
they
halted
in
long
lines
resting
calmly
on
their
arms
until
the
articles
of
capitulation
were
signed
it
took
but
an
hour
or
so
to
arrange
for
the
disposition
of
our
troops
among
the
various
barracks
and
for
the
removal
of
the
disarmed
spanish
garrison
to
the
designated
places
of
confinement
then
command
was
passed
along
by
mounted
officers
for
the
several
regiments
to
proceed
to
their
quarters
for
the
night
in
columns
of
four
they
marched
off
with
the
easy
swing
and
unconcern
of
troops
on
practice
march
a
thin
cordon
of
sentinels
appeared
at
easy
hailing
distance
along
the
principal
streets
and
the
task
was
accomplished
by
noon
next
day
they
had
a
stability
as
great
as
though
they
had
been
there
for
years
not
a
woman
was
molested
not
a
man
insulted
and
the
children
on
the
street
were
romping
with
added
zest
to
show
off
before
their
friends
the
banks
felt
safe
to
open
their
vaults
and
the
merchants
found
a
healthily
rising
market
the
ships
blockaded
and
idling
at
anchor
in
the
harbour
discharged
their
cargoes
the
customs
duties
being
assessed
according
to
the
spanish
tariff
by
bright
young
volunteers
aided
by
interpreters
the
streets
were
cleaned
of
their
accumulated
filth
and
the
courts
of
law
were
opened
all
this
was
done
under
general
anderson
command
and
it
seems
to
me
is
much
to
his
credit
a
daughter
of
general
anderson
who
was
there
at
the
time
with
her
father
writes
days
of
intense
anxiety
followed
the
opening
of
hostilities
the
filipinos
were
pushed
back
more
and
more
but
we
feared
treachery
within
the
city
we
heard
that
they
were
going
to
poison
our
water
supply
that
they
were
going
to
rise
and
bolo
us
all
that
every
servant
had
his
secret
instructions
also
that
manila
was
to
be
burned
there
proved
to
be
something
in
this
for
twice
fires
were
started
and
gained
some
headway
and
we
women
were
banished
to
the
transports
again
aguinaldo
had
demanded
at
least
joint
occupation
of
the
city
and
his
full
share
of
the
loot
as
a
reward
for
services
rendered
we
can
imagine
his
disgust
at
being
told
that
americans
did
not
loot
and
that
they
intended
to
hold
the
city
themselves
if
there
had
been
no
other
reason
for
refusing
him
the
conduct
of
his
troops
in
the
suburbs
would
have
furnished
a
sufficient
one
for
they
were
utterly
beyond
control
assaulting
and
plundering
their
own
brother
filipinos
and
neutral
foreigners
as
well
as
spaniards
and
torturing
their
prisoners
but
this
refusal
justifiable
as
it
certainly
was
marked
the
real
beginning
of
the
insurrection
against
american
rule
though
there
was
no
immediate
outbreak
aguinaldo
was
a
mestizo
school
teacher
when
in
he
became
leader
of
the
insurrection
against
spain
the
money
with
which
spain
hoped
to
purchase
peace
was
to
be
paid
in
three
instalments
the
principal
condition
being
that
the
filipino
leaders
should
leave
the
islands
this
they
did
going
to
hongkong
where
the
first
instalment
was
promptly
deposited
in
a
bank
the
second
instalment
to
aguinaldo
great
disgust
was
paid
over
to
filipinos
left
in
the
islands
and
the
last
one
was
not
paid
at
all
this
was
just
as
well
for
him
because
his
fellow
insurrectionists
were
already
demanding
of
him
an
accounting
for
the
funds
in
hongkong
and
had
him
summoned
to
court
for
the
purpose
this
proceeding
he
wisely
avoided
by
leaving
for
europe
in
disguise
he
got
only
as
far
as
singapore
however
for
there
in
april
of
he
heard
of
the
probability
of
american
interference
in
the
islands
and
interviewed
our
consul
the
for
this
interview
was
an
unscrupulous
interpreter
whose
intrigues
were
destined
to
have
effects
for
us
it
has
been
charged
that
both
our
consul
at
singapore
and
the
one
at
hongkong
committed
this
nation
to
a
policy
favouring
philippine
independence
but
the
whole
question
of
american
pledges
finally
resolves
itself
into
a
choice
between
the
word
of
an
american
admiral
and
a
chinese
mestizo
when
spain
had
failed
to
pay
over
to
aguinaldo
the
balance
of
the
peace
money
he
had
promptly
gone
to
work
to
organize
another
revolution
from
the
safe
harbourage
of
hongkong
his
flight
to
singapore
had
interrupted
this
but
now
with
the
americans
so
conspicuously
there
to
help
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
put
his
plans
in
operation
a
month
after
the
battle
of
manila
bay
aguinaldo
proclaimed
himself
president
in
reality
military
dictator
of
the
filipino
republic
but
this
republic
existed
only
on
paper
dewey
accurately
states
the
condition
of
affairs
when
he
says
our
fleet
had
destroyed
the
only
government
there
was
and
there
was
no
other
government
there
was
a
reign
of
terror
throughout
the
philippines
looting
robbing
murdering
a
form
of
municipal
election
was
held
but
if
a
candidate
not
favoured
by
the
insurgents
was
elected
he
was
at
once
deposed
one
candidate
won
his
election
by
threatening
to
kill
any
one
who
got
the
office
in
his
place
persons
contrary
minded
were
not
allowed
to
vote
these
happenings
hardly
suggest
a
republican
form
of
government
but
they
are
typical
of
conditions
at
that
time
illustration
aguinaldo
palace
at
malolos
naturally
the
president
was
not
recognized
by
the
american
officials
and
they
were
justified
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
before
the
year
was
up
aguinaldo
himself
had
come
to
realize
that
he
could
not
maintain
order
among
his
people
and
tried
to
resign
from
his
office
meanwhile
his
lack
of
recognition
by
the
americans
and
his
exclusion
from
the
spoils
of
war
so
far
as
manila
was
concerned
showed
him
that
his
only
hope
of
achieving
his
ambitions
lay
in
driving
these
interlopers
from
the
islands
but
for
the
time
being
while
awaiting
a
propitious
moment
for
attack
he
occupied
himself
and
his
men
by
conquering
the
spaniards
in
the
outlying
provinces
since
there
was
no
coöperation
among
the
spanish
forces
he
was
quite
successful
having
proclaimed
the
republic
with
himself
at
the
head
he
felt
justified
in
maintaining
with
the
aid
of
his
booty
a
truly
regal
state
in
his
palace
at
malolos
aping
the
forms
and
ceremonies
of
the
spanish
governors
in
manila
as
fast
as
church
property
or
property
belonging
to
spaniards
fell
into
his
hands
it
was
confiscated
and
turned
over
to
the
state
if
aguinaldo
can
be
considered
the
state
his
houses
and
those
of
his
generals
were
furnished
from
spanish
possessions
all
title
deeds
were
systematically
destroyed
or
hidden
and
administrators
were
appointed
for
the
property
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
americans
and
manila
because
our
forces
seemed
reluctant
to
fight
the
filipinos
like
the
mexicans
believed
that
they
must
be
cowards
and
afraid
to
meet
them
a
mexican
paper
has
recently
told
its
readers
what
a
simple
matter
it
would
be
if
war
were
declared
for
their
troops
to
cross
the
border
and
crush
such
slight
opposition
as
may
be
offered
to
the
capture
of
washington
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
filipinos
felt
confident
of
success
especially
after
their
victories
over
the
spaniards
in
the
outlying
regions
by
january
admiral
dewey
general
anderson
and
general
merritt
had
left
the
philippine
islands
and
general
otis
was
in
command
he
announced
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
be
extended
over
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
next
day
aguinaldo
retorted
with
what
was
virtually
a
declaration
of
war
from
then
on
he
and
his
advisers
hastened
their
preparations
for
the
conflict
members
of
the
native
militia
who
were
living
in
manila
under
the
protection
of
the
american
garrison
were
warned
to
stand
ready
to
receive
the
signal
which
should
start
the
sack
and
pillage
of
the
city
and
the
massacre
of
its
inhabitants
by
the
end
of
january
there
were
about
thirty
thousand
filipinos
under
arms
fronting
the
american
lines
outside
the
city
all
keyed
up
for
the
moment
when
they
should
be
let
loose
to
drive
the
americans
into
the
sea
this
time
the
spoils
of
manila
should
not
be
snatched
from
them
the
signal
for
the
advance
was
to
be
a
conflagration
in
manila
ten
thousand
militiamen
were
to
rise
set
fire
to
the
city
free
the
spanish
prisoners
of
war
arm
them
with
arms
stored
in
the
arsenal
and
attack
the
americans
they
were
to
be
promptly
aided
in
this
last
detail
by
the
thirty
thousand
filipinos
waiting
outside
who
surrounding
the
city
would
drive
back
the
fourteen
thousand
american
soldiers
upon
their
burning
citadel
and
upon
the
two
hundred
thousand
filipinos
who
would
by
this
time
have
joined
their
countrymen
if
everything
had
worked
out
as
he
had
planned
aguinaldo
might
very
probably
have
entered
the
city
he
chose
a
night
early
in
february
at
a
time
when
he
knew
the
american
reinforcements
which
had
been
ordered
could
not
yet
have
arrived
firing
began
about
nine
in
the
evening
near
the
san
juan
bridge
and
continued
during
the
night
meanwhile
the
militia
in
the
city
tried
to
assemble
but
the
groups
were
promptly
fired
on
and
dispersed
in
the
morning
the
ships
of
dewey
fleet
opened
fire
from
the
flanks
of
the
american
line
a
little
later
our
troops
sprang
forward
and
swept
their
antagonists
before
their
fierce
attack
in
this
encounter
the
filipinos
lost
about
eight
hundred
and
the
americans
two
hundred
and
fifty
for
a
week
the
insurgents
were
quite
demoralized
and
no
wonder
for
this
was
not
the
way
they
had
expected
the
cowardly
americans
to
act
but
when
they
saw
that
our
men
did
not
follow
up
their
advantage
by
pursuit
their
courage
revived
and
they
began
once
more
to
believe
those
things
which
they
wished
to
believe
our
troops
had
to
stay
where
they
were
because
they
had
not
sufficient
transportation
to
take
them
anywhere
else
because
the
enemy
within
the
city
still
needed
their
attention
and
because
their
reinforcements
had
not
arrived
when
these
came
general
otis
divided
his
forces
general
macarthur
began
a
movement
from
his
right
against
the
insurgents
who
contested
every
village
and
locality
capable
of
defense
and
burned
every
train
before
abandoning
it
to
american
hands
the
insurgent
capital
malolos
was
occupied
in
april
general
lawton
took
santa
cruz
the
american
casualties
during
these
operations
were
about
ten
thousand
officers
and
men
but
the
sick
report
listed
fifteen
per
cent
of
the
expedition
mostly
from
heat
prostration

san
juan
bridge
general
lawton
who
went
out
early
in
and
was
killed
in
december
of
the
same
year
at
san
mateo
is
believed
to
have
been
perhaps
the
most
able
of
our
commanders
uniformly
the
filipinos
lost
but
when
their
courage
waned
their
officers
would
announce
that
they
had
won
a
big
victory
somewhere
else
in
one
day
they
reported
we
had
lost
thousand
men
in
a
region
where
in
the
entire
month
we
had
lost
but
on
another
occasion
they
announced
that
two
thousand
colonels
had
been
killed
they
must
have
thought
our
troops
were
all
from
kentucky
all
summer
and
into
the
fall
this
more
or
less
formal
and
regular
warfare
continued
but
by
that
time
aguinaldo
had
decided
that
while
a
concentrated
field
army
might
appear
more
impressive
to
foreigners
and
be
better
for
advertising
purposes
it
was
not
effective
for
his
purpose
and
some
change
must
be
made
the
discontent
among
the
conservative
men
who
still
had
anything
to
lose
was
increasing
while
the
labourers
in
the
fields
the
fishermen
and
the
great
masses
of
the
people
were
growing
weary
of
the
war
and
the
exactions
of
the
commanders
of
their
troops
the
spell
which
aguinaldo
had
cast
over
luzon
was
almost
broken
the
war
was
nearly
over
it
seemed
in
a
civilized
country
it
would
have
been
over
to
the
americans
it
appeared
that
the
insurrection
had
been
destroyed
and
that
all
they
now
had
to
do
was
to
sweep
up
the
remnants
of
the
insurgent
forces
by
a
system
of
police
administration
not
likely
to
be
either
difficult
or
dangerous
in
november
macarthur
had
his
force
ready
to
strike
anything
within
reach
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
within
reach
to
strike
he
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
organized
resistance
left
that
the
insurgent
army
had
broken
into
fragments
which
would
soon
become
banditti
the
disbandment
of
the
insurgent
field
forces
which
the
american
authorities
took
to
mean
the
coming
of
a
general
submission
to
our
rule
was
followed
by
a
long
period
of
inactivity
this
of
course
strengthened
the
impression
but
the
time
was
being
used
by
the
filipinos
to
prepare
for
a
new
method
of
warfare
and
to
organize
for
resistance
by
means
of
a
general
banding
of
the
people
together
in
support
of
the
guerillas
in
the

general
lawton
to
obtain
this
necessary
coöperation
the
leaders
announced
the
inflexible
principle
that
every
native
residing
within
the
limits
of
the
archipelago
owed
active
individual
allegiance
to
the
insurgent
cause
this
was
enforced
by
severe
penalties
including
burial
alive
which
were
systematically
exacted
there
was
little
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
victims
who
accepted
the
new
policy
with
a
curious
combination
of
loyalty
apathy
ignorance
and
timidity
in
this
way
there
arose
a
strange
system
of
dual
government
in
many
cases
the
town
officials
openly
serving
the
americans
while
they
were
secretly
aiding
the
insurrection
and
with
apparently
equal
solicitude
for
both
each
town
was
the
base
for
the
neighbouring
guerillas
and
when
a
band
was
too
hard
pressed
it
would
dissolve
and
take
refuge
in
its
own
community
this
was
easy
enough
to
accomplish
with
the
aid
of
the
people
for
it
took
very
little
to
transform
a
filipino
soldier
into
a
good
imitation
of
a
peaceful
native
several
months
before
the
formal
declaration
of
guerilla
warfare
in
november
of
the
filipino
commanders
had
adopted
a
policy
of
occupying
a
succession
of
strong
defensive
positions
and
forcing
our
army
to
a
never
ending
repetition
of
tactical
deployments
this
they
did
with
such
skill
that
they
were
for
a
time
successful
the
native
force
would
hover
within
easy
distance
of
the
american
camps
but
would
avoid
close
conflict
and
temporarily
disband
this
would
not
be
regarded
by
them
as
a
calamity
but
simply
as
a
change
from
one
form
of
action
to
another
and
even
a
positive
advantage
by
february
of
general
bates
had
succeeded
in
scattering
the
larger
bodies
in
the
south
of
luzon
and
while
some
of
the
filipino
leaders
and
their
followers
abandoned
the
cause
which
they
saw
was
hopeless
others
returned
to
the
life
of
bandits
which
in
many
cases
had
probably
been
their
profession
before
the
war
when
their
guns
were
gone
they
took
up
the
knife
and
the
torch
they
did
not
cease
to
call
themselves
soldiers
of
the
republic
but
they
were
not
in
reality
by
september
general
macarthur
who
had
succeeded
general
otis
in
command
of
the
american
forces
in
the
islands
realized
that
the
opposition
to
american
control
came
from
the
towns
and
that
the
guerilla
bands
could
not
exist
without
their
support
at
first
he
thought
that
on
account
of
the
efficiency
of
his
troops
the
natives
would
be
actuated
both
by
conviction
and
to
support
him
but
four
months
later
he
saw
that
further
pressure
was
needed
to
secure
this
so
he
ordered
that
all
persons
suspected
of
contraband
traffic
with
insurgent
organizations
should
be
arrested
and
sent
to
manila
in
january
he
ordered
the
deportation
to
guam
of
filipino
leaders
sympathizers
and
agents
who
were
to
remain
there
until
peace
had
been
formally
declared
two
months
later
aguinaldo
was
captured
by
the
funston
of
the
suicide
squad
the
effect
of
this
measure
was
to
alarm
the
leaders
of
course
who
now
realized
that
they
could
be
held
responsible
for
their
acts
orders
were
also
issued
that
all
men
who
surrendered
should
be
disarmed
but
released
at
once
while
those
captured
in
the
field
or
arrested
in
the
towns
should
be
held
in
custody
till
the
end
of
the
war
a
letter
was
found
written
by
a
bandit
leader
in
march
saying
that
he
was
ordered
to
proceed
more
rapidly
with
his
operations
as
bryan
ordered
emilio
aguinaldo
to
keep
the
war
going
vigorously
until
april
however
true
that
may
have
been
it
is
certain
that
the
encouragement
which
the
insurgents
received
from
the
country
they
were
fighting
much
prolonged
hostilities
and
caused
the
loss
of
many
lives
on
both
sides
it
is
hard
to
realize
at
this
distance
the
lengths
to
which
the
went
or
were
willing
to
go
in
those
days
governor
pack
told
me
of
an
experience
he
had
with
one
of
them
a
new
englander
of
good
family
and
american
antecedents
pack
was
on
his
way
out
to
the
islands
at
the
time
and
on
arriving
at
hongkong
received
the
tidings
of
mckinley
assassination
he
was
surprised
to
see
this
man
a
rush
up
to
a
filipino
with
the
news
and
shake
his
hand
congratulating
him
on
what
had
happened
the
governor
then
a
young
civilian
could
not
forget
the
shocking
incident
and
later
when
they
shared
the
same
stateroom
on
the
small
boat
for
manila
he
discovered
papers
which
proved
that
his
companion
intended
to
furnish
aid
and
encouragement
to
any
natives
who
wished
to
fight
against
american
tyranny
this
discovery
gave
pack
his
appointment
as
one
of
the
seven
lieutenant
governors
of
the
hill
tribes
but
the
other
man
was
punished
only
by
being
refused
entrance
to
the
islands
it
was
the
stupid
and
foolish
fashion
in
america
then
as
indeed
it
still
is
to
call
this
particular
form
of
treason
idealism
and
be
lenient
with
it
our
soldiers
found
it
difficult
to
take
seriously
the
bands
of
half
naked
men
who
they
knew
had
been
pillaging
the
villages
of
their
own
race
it
was
true
that
these
bands
were
difficult
to
pursue
and
capture
but
an
army
which
fought
only
from
ambush
whose
detachments
fell
only
upon
stragglers
and
carefully
avoided
the
main
body
of
its
enemy
and
which
showed
no
regard
for
the
sacredness
of
a
flag
of
truce
could
not
inspire
much
respect
plunder
appeared
to
be
the
sole
excuse
for
its
existence
and
the
pompous
titles
assumed
by
its
commanders
were
amusing
for
the
leaders
of
robbers
the
americans
followed
the
retreating
bandits
without
hatred
and
without
fear
but
they
became
weary
of
the
eternal
pursuit
and
felt
a
growing
irritation
the
filipinos
however
felt
very
differently
about
their
soldiers
and
it
is
only
fair
to
give
their
side
too
especially
as
it
may
throw
some
light
on
the
mexican
situation
even
the
richest
and
most
highly
educated
men
found
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
these
poor
bands
which
were
after
all
composed
of
their
own
people
fighting
and
suffering
for
a
cause
which
they
could
at
least
understand
whether
or
not
they
sympathized
with
it
they
did
not
regard
the
pillaging
tortures
and
murders
to
which
the
filipinos
subjected
their
own
people
as
we
did
they
called
the
robbery
collecting
contributions
for
the
support
of
the
war
as
for
the
murders
in
the
orient
to
kill
is
an
immemorial
right
of
the
rulers
of
men
what
if
they
did
fight
disguised
as
peaceful
country
folk
they
were
a
weak
people
fighting
against
a
strong
they
were
naked
and
they
were
hungry
and
they
were
fighting
for
a
cause
their
arms
were
often
of
little
use
and
they
made
powder
out
of
match
heads
and
cartridge
shells
out
of
the
zinc
roofs
of
parish
buildings
and
even
then
they
had
only
ammunition
enough
to
fire
a
few
volleys
and
then
run
but
men
so
armed
had
forced
the
united
states
to
send
out
nearly
seventy
thousand
well
equipped
soldiers
to
subdue
them
to
the
native
filipino
as
perhaps
to
the
mexican
the
ragged
and
half
savage
figures
of
the
guerillas
stood
for
their
vision
of
a
united
race
but
it
was
natural
that
our
troops
could
not
understand
this
and
that
they
should
gradually
become
embittered
against
their
antagonists
the
officers
by
the
necessary
division
of
our
forces
found
themselves
confronted
with
conditions
utterly
alien
to
their
experience
they
had
to
live
in
native
houses
or
churches
in
the
midst
of
four
or
five
thousand
people
whose
language
they
did
not
speak
and
whose
thoughts
were
not
their
thoughts
most
of
them
were
young
men
they
came
from
all
over
the
united
states
and
were
neither
monsters
nor
saints
but
good
examples
of
their
time
and
country
when
these
officers
learned
that
the
dignified
asiatics
who
called
upon
them
daily
who
drank
with
them
who
talked
with
them
and
who
held
offices
under
our
government
were
also
spies
of
the
guerilla
leaders
secretly
aiding
those
who
were
anxious
to
win
the
price
set
on
their
heads
they
were
hardly
pleased
when
they
found
that
every
movement
of
the
guerillas
was
reported
to
them
just
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
while
every
movement
of
their
own
small
forces
was
promptly
made
known
to
the
enemy
and
when
they
were
present
at
the
disinterment
of
the
twisted
bodies
of
the
men
who
had
been
buried
alive
because
they
were
loyal
to
us
they
decided
that
stricter
measures
were
necessary
this
was
a
state
of
war
within
wide
limits
their
will
was
law
upon
their
judgment
hung
not
merely
their
lives
and
those
of
their
men
but
the
honour
of
their
country
and
their
regiment
perhaps
in
some
cases
they
met
cruelty
with
cruelty
but
they
at
least
tried
to
be
honest
and
just
and
the
people
came
to
realize
this
and
also
that
they
were
not
afraid
with
the
result
that
whole
communities
transferred
their
allegiance
from
their
own
guerilla
leaders
to
a
single
young
american
not
because
he
understood
them
or
sympathized
with
them
but
because
he
was
a
man
whom
they
could
trust
and
respect
it
was
july
of
four
years
after
our
taking
of
manila
before
the
islands
could
be
officially
declared
pacified
let
us
hope
that
the
lessons
which
we
learned
then
may
not
be
forgotten
in
our
dealings
with
mexico
chapter
iv
following
the
flag
they
taught
filipinos
the
right
way
to
work
and
they
taught
as
if
teaching
were
fun
they
taught
them
to
spell
and
to
build
themselves
roads
and
the
best
way
to
handle
a
gun
were
their
salaries
so
big
that
the
task
was
worth
while
did
they
save
a
centavo
of
pay
have
the
average
men
an
account
with
the
bank
never
a
cent
not
they
so
we
have
a
job
and
we
have
a
cent
and
nobody
cares
a
damn
but
we
done
our
work
and
we
done
it
well
to
the
glory
of
uncle
sam
and
we
seen
a
lot
and
we
lived
a
lot
in
these
islands
over
the
sea
would
we
change
with
our
brothers
grown
rich
at
home
praise
be
to
god
not
we
the
swan
song
in
the
manila
it
is
strangely
enough
to
the
influence
of
that
arch
william
jennings
bryan
that
we
owe
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
of
paris
which
not
only
ended
the
war
with
spain
but
expressly
provided
for
the
purchase
of
the
philippine
islands
the
democrats
were
opposed
to
the
treaty
and
were
powerful
enough
in
the
senate
to
have
held
it
up
had
not
bryan
used
his
authority
to
secure
the
vote
needed
for
its
ratification
it
is
amusing
to
note
that
a
year
later
after
enabling
us
to
acquire
the
islands
he
used
all
his
power
to
prevent
our
keeping
them
he
was
at
this
time
in
need
of
a
popular
plank
in
his
third
presidential
platform
and
the
sorrows
of
the
filipinos
suited
his
purpose
admirably
soon
after
the
treaty
of
paris
and
long
before
the
end
of
the
insurrection
mckinley
appointed
a
commission
of
experts
to
go
out
to
the
islands
and
report
to
him
on
conditions
there
they
found
a
country
whose
civilization
was
to
put
it
hopefully
at
a
standstill
it
was
too
big
a
problem
to
be
straightened
out
by
a
few
ambitious
filipinos
the
commission
returned
to
america
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
our
occupation
congress
soon
passed
a
special
organic
act
for
the
organization
of
a
civil
government
in
the
islands
to
succeed
the
military
rule
then
in
force
in
president
mckinley
appointed
the
second
commission
headed
by
taft
which
was
instructed
to
assume
control
of
the
islands
gradually
relieving
the
army
wherever
conditions
allowed
of
their
doing
so
this
commission
had
five
members
three
of
them
lawyers
two
of
whom
had
been
on
the
bench
and
two
professors
its
functions
were
at
first
legislative
and
judicial
but
in
when
the
president
of
the
commission
taft
became
governor
general
of
the
islands
the
other
members
were
given
the
portfolios
of
the
different
departments
and
executive
power
in
the
pacified
parts
of
the
islands
dean
worcester
a
member
of
the
earlier
commission
and
already
an
authority
on
the
philippines
became
the
first
minister
of
the
interior
luke
wright
the
vice
governor
had
the
department
of
commerce
and
police
ide
former
chief
justice
of
samoa
had
charge
of
finance
and
justice
while
professor
moses
was
put
at
the
head
of
public
instruction
governor
taft
became
really
the
father
of
the
philippines
for
when
he
left
the
islands
in
to
become
secretary
of
war
he
had
even
higher
authority
over
them
than
he
had
had
as
governor
while
still
later
as
president
of
the
united
states
he
was
able
to
see
that
the
same
high
standard
of
appointments
was
maintained
mckinley
charged
this
commission
that
their
work
was
to
subjugate
but
to
we
made
many
mistakes
for
we
were
new
to
the
business
and
dealing
with
a
strange
people
but
until
very
lately
even
the
selfishness
which
is
supposed
to
be
inherent
in
party
politics
has
been
absent
in
our
dealings
with
this
people
whom
we
considered
our
sacred
charge
no
one
ever
asked
an
american
official
in
the
islands
what
his
politics
were
even
the
governorship
itself
was
out
of
the
reach
of
the
spoilsman
of
the
five
governors
who
were
appointed
by
the
republican
administrations
only
one
besides
the
first
governor
belonged
to
the
dominant
party
and
he
was
in
office
but
a
few
months
since
the
taft
commission
first
organized
several
changes
have
taken
place
filipino
members
have
been
added
and
it
has
acquired
the
character
of
an
upper
house
rather
than
a
legislature
the
work
of
a
lower
house
is
done
by
the
assembly
made
up
of
members
chosen
by
the
people
of
the
christian
tribes
they
have
no
authority
over
the
moro
and
other
tribes
which
are
legislated
for
by
the
commission
directly
the
filipinos
control
their
municipal
and
county
governments
but
their
finances
are
kept
under
supervision
the
problems
which
the
commissioners
had
to
solve
were
many
and
varied
trade
was
at
a
standstill
during
the
last
normal
year
under
spain
the
exports
from
the
islands
had
amounted
to
about
sixteen
million
dollars
by
they
had
more
than
trebled
there
was
also
a
currency
problem
coins
from
everywhere
mexico
china
america
india
were
in
common
circulation
with
almost
daily
fluctuations
in
value
the
islands
now
have
their
own
money
on
a
gold
basis
then
close
on
the
heels
of
the
insurrection
came
a
famine
locusts
swept
over
the
land
and
destroyed
what
little
grain
the
war
had
left
the
natives
in
some
parts
of
the
archipelago
ate
the
locusts
however
and
liked
them
making
the
work
of
the
officials
more
difficult
grain
shipped
from
america
decayed
in
the
storehouses
before
it
could
be
distributed
and
as
if
that
were
not
enough
carabaos
died
by
the
thousand
from
rinderpest
but
the
most
difficult
of
all
was
the
problem
of
the
friar
lands
thousands
of
acres
of
valuable
land
had
been
acquired
during
spanish
rule
by
the
different
orders
of
monks
and
held
by
them
with
great
profit
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
aguinaldo
rebellion
was
the
exactions
of
these
wealthy
churchmen
which
galled
a
patient
people
into
final
revolt
and
during
the
ascendancy
of
the
insurgent
government
resulted
in
the
confiscation
of
church
property
and
the
flight
of
the
friars
these
men
took
refuge
in
manila
and
petitioned
the
new
government
for
a
settlement
of
their
claims
their
legal
rights
were
not
to
be
disputed
but
to
return
them
to
their
property
and
protect
them
there
would
have
brought
on
us
the
increased
enmity
of
a
people
whose
friendship
we
were
trying
to
win
the
friends
of
the
friars
were
no
friends
of
the
people
it
was
decided
to
have
the
philippine
government
buy
these
lands
from
the
church
which
was
accordingly
arranged
even
this
was
not
a
popular
solution
but
seems
to
have
been
the
best
that
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances
of
these
lands
are
still
vacant
road
building
was
one
of
the
most
baffling
of
the
problems
the
people
had

a

to

were

would

is
to

awaken

to
responsible
citizenship
it
is
a
task
still
far
from
accomplishment
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
work
of
the
assembly
after
eight
years
of
fair
trial
does
not
encourage
filipinization
of

it
is

times

bodies
have
equal
power
not
only
to
initiate
legislation
but
to
block
the

other
bills

has
been
able

hold
up

of

legislation

it

body
the

by

spent
the
valuable
time
of
the
entire
first
session
talking
them
over
and
the
commission
refused
to
concur
one
was
to
increase
their
own
salaries
of
course
another
was
to
erect
monuments
to
all
the
ilustrados
who
had
cried
los
most
loudly
others
wanted
to
fly
the
philippine
flag
above

osmeña
the
speaker
of
the
first
assembly
as
may
be
imagined
a
body
of
men
which
can
pass
such
bills
is
quite
capable
of
blocking
the
sane
legislation
which
comes
to
them
for
approval
and
unfortunately
they
have
the
power
to
do
this
the
way
in
which
the
slavery
question
was
handled
illustrates
their
methods
slavery
was
known
to
exist
in
the
islands
and
to
take
two
forms
actual
slavery
where
one
person
was
sold
by
another
and
a
sort
of
or
peonage
where
a
man
sold
his
services
for
debt
the
peon
was
given
his
keep
but
the
interest
on
his
debt
was
added
faster
than
he
could
earn
he
was
really
a
slave
except
that
he
had
sold
himself
rather
than
been
sold
by
another
but
his
debts
might
be
bought
and
sold
so
that
it
amounted
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
interest
was
sometimes
as
high
as
ten
per
cent
a
month
while
fifty
cents
a
month
was
allowed
for
his
services
worcester
in
his
book
tells
of
a
man
who
borrowed
which
he
and
his
wife
and
children
worked
several
years
in
the
effort
to
repay
but
by
that
time
the
amount
had
become
spain
had
nominally
abolished
slavery
long
before
but
it
had
continued
in
force
in
both
the
christian
and
provinces
the
legislators
themselves
held
peons
the
law
of
congress
creating
the
philippine
government
prohibited
slavery
but
there
are
no
penalties
attached
so
it
could
not
be
enforced
the
filipinos
denied
that
slavery
existed
in
the
islands
worcester
made
a
careful
investigation
and
an
exhaustive
report
on
both
slavery
and
peonage
all
but
a
few
copies
of
this
report
were
burned
by
a
filipino
official
it
was
a
subject
which
neither
the
filipino
politician
nor
their
friends
the
wished
to
see
discussed
in
print
the
manila
papers
had
been
absolutely
silent
on
the
subject
and
even
the
legislation
which
was
finally
forced
through
after
having
been
tabled
again
and
again
without
so
much
as
the
briefest
formality
of
discussion
passed
unnoticed
it
was
a
sore
subject
and
the
filipino
method
of
treating
a
sore
subject
is
not
to
heal
it
but
to
refrain
from
discussing
it
there
is
no
question
but
we
have
given
the
filipinos
too
much
power
for
their
own
good
they
now
under
the
democratic
administration
have
five
members
in
the
commission
to
america
four
they
have
much
power
only
colonies
such
as
canada
and
australia
have
more
while
egypt
has
been
given
less
in
a
generation
than
the
filipinos
have
received
in
ten
years
the
present
governor
francis
burton
harrison
has
been
severely
criticized
his
party
was
pledged
to
a
rapid
filipinization
which
has
proved
disastrous
for
it
was
devised
by
men
wholly
ignorant
of
the
situation
the
destruction
of
the
wonderful
civil
service
system
so
carefully
built
up
in
the
early
days
as
an
object
lesson
to
politicians
is
only
one
of
many
changes
which
have
been
brought
about
we
have
certainly
lost
prestige
in
the
islands
under
the
democratic
administration
filipinos
no
longer
remove
their
hats
during
the
playing
of
the
star
spangled
banner
on
the
luneta
so
governor
harrison
finally
tried
to
discontinue
the
playing
of
the
national
anthem
the
american
community
would
not
stand
this
however
so
it
was
resumed
in
many
other
ways
the
filipinos
have
become
cocky
this
of
course
does
not
apply
to
the
tao
who
plods
along
regardless
of
politics
a
friend
wrote
me
recently
i
do
think
i
could
give
you
a
more
accurate
idea
of
what
most
americans
and
british
and
even
intelligent
natives
think
of
this
democratic
administration
than
to
repeat
a
conversation
i
overheard
in
the
fort
mckinley
cars
one
morning
between
two
coloured
american
soldiers
they
began
by
laughing
at
them
what
they
want
speech
and
speaking
of
the
filipinos
as
children

one
more

this
rotten
administration

and
foreign
educators
clergymen
army
and
navy
officers
editors
american
and
british
and
many
filipinos
of
undoubted
patriotism
and
intelligence
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
assure
you
that
the
demoralizing
tendency
of
the
policies
of
the
present
american
administration
in
the
islands
is
deserving
of
the
widest
publicity
the
situation
he
says
is
bidding
fair
to
become
a
national
disgrace
if
we
allow
politics
and
sentiment
to
take
the
place
of
reason
and
justice
he
goes
on
to
say
there
is
no
phenomenon
of
our
national
life
more
passing
strange
than
that
which
induces
many
of
our
good
people
to
accept
the
statements
of
paid
emissaries
of
the
filipino
junto
or
some
of
our
new
and
inexperienced
officials
at
manila
rather
than
those
of
our
fellow
countrymen
of
long
administrative
experience
in
the
islands
the
loss
of
men
like
governor
forbes
worcester
heiser
and
others
is
looked
upon
as
a
distinct
setback
in
the
development
of
better
and
more
stable
institutions
in
the
entire
orient
in
the
interest
of
humanity
as
a
whole
all
of
which
only
bears
out
what
lord
cromer
told
forbes
if
your
personnel
employed
in
the
administration
of
dependencies
at
a
distance
becomes
subject
to
change
with
changing
political
parties
you
are
doomed
to
failure
in
your
effort
to
govern
countries
overseas
there
has
recently
been
a
great
financial
depression
in
the
islands
due
partly
to
hoarding
against
threatened
independence
and
partly
to
the
difficulty
the
new
filipino
officials
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
find
in
collecting
the
usual
amount
a
slump
in
real
estate
followed
quickly
upon
the
news
that
we
might
shortly
leave
the
islands

the
cattle
plague
which
had
worked
such
havoc
and
which
had
finally
been
conquered
after
tremendous
expenditure
of
money
and
energy
broke
out
again
immediately
upon
the
substitution
of
filipinos
for
white
men
in
the
service
some
time
the
good
people
at
home
will
learn
that
giving
a
child
candy
because
it
cries
for
candy
is
not
always
the
best
thing
for
the
child
the
filipinos
are
in
many
ways
children
delightful
ones
with
charming
manners
but
needing
a
firm
and
even
rule
till
they
come
of
age
and
take
over
their
own
affairs
most
filipinos
of
intelligence
realize
this
in
fact
they
have
of
late
been
rushing
in
petitions
signed
by
their
best
and
most
influential
citizens
urging
the
retention
of
the
islands
in
their
present
standing
what
the
filipino
wishes
for
himself
depends
upon
the
man
only
one
in
ten
among
the
civilized
tribes
knows
anything
about
the
discussion
of
independence
the
taos
would
like
independence
if
they
believe
it
to
be
what
their
politicians
have
told
them
freedom
to
do
as
they
please
and
exemption
from
taxes
otherwise
they
are
not
interested
when
the
jones
bill
was
being
discussed
a
moro
elevator
boy
at
the
war
department
in
washington
was
asked
if
the
filipinos
are
given
their
independence
how
will
you
feel
i
am
an
american
now
he
answered
but
if
that
happen
i
go
back
and
with
the
moros
fight
the
filipinos
most
people
fail
to
realize
that
the
islands
are
no
financial
burden
to
this
country
they
are
and
have
always
been
wholly
their
revenues
pay
their
bills
and
their
taxes
incidentally
are
the
lowest
in
the
civilized
world
we
keep
soldiers
there
but
only
the
cost
of
their
transportation
is
extra
our
rule
in
the
philippines
has
been
the
greatest
of
all
paradoxes
a
benevolent
despotism
working
ardently
for
its
own
destruction
this
is
very
unusual
and
rather
fine
we
ought
to
be
proud
of
what
we
have
done
and
very
anxious
to
see
the
work
well
finished
good
men
have
given
their
lives
for
it
and
few
of
those
who
lived
have
come
out
after
years
of
thankless
toil
in
a
tropical
land
with
as
much
as
they
had
when
they
went
into
the
service
we
owe
it
to
them
and
to
our
helpless
wards
as
well
as
to
our
national
honour
to
see
the
thing
through
chapter
v
healing
a
nation
the
sanitary
conditions
which
existed
in
the
islands
twenty
odd
years
ago
would
seem
to
us
appalling
but
perhaps
they
were
no
worse
than
those
of
some
other
tropical
countries
at
that
time
even
the
most
progressive
colonizers
like
the
english
had
given
up
trying
radical
reforms
contenting
themselves
with
making
passably
healthful
conditions
especially
for
the
european
part
of
the
towns
the
combination
of
climate
and
native
inertia
seemed
to
them
one
which
it
was
difficult
and
almost
hopeless
to
combat
so
it
remained
for
us
to
prove
that
the
thing
could
be
done
that
a
tropical
country
could
be
made
sanitary
and
hygienic
for
all
its
inhabitants
whether
they
were
white
or
brown
or
yellow
and
whether
they
wanted
it
made
so
or
not
if
we
had
done
nothing
else
for
our
restless
dependency
that
achievement
would
be
a
sufficient
crown
of
glory
manila
was
then
as
it
still
is
the
most
highly
civilized
spot
in
the
islands
as
i
have
said
much
of
the
walled
city
was
built
of
stone
and
plaster
but
many
of
the
natives
in
the
suburbs
lived
in
houses
made
of
wood
and
raised
on
stilts
no
provision
whatever
was
made
for
drainage
or
for
the
removal
of
garbage
each
house
was
a
law
unto
itself
and
very
often
an
offense
unto
its
neighbours
illustration
a
large
part
of
the
city
drained
directly
or
indirectly
into
the
pasig
river
here
also
the
carabao
which
is
not
a
fastidious
animal
went
for
his
mud
baths
and
the
women
washed
their
clothes
this
river
furnished
drinking
water
for
all
who
lived
near
enough
to
share
the
privilege
it
was
said
to
have
a
flavour
like
the
ganges
which
they
sorely
missed
later
on
when
a
purer
supply
was
substituted
the
medieval
wall
which
allowed
for
many
damp
unhealthy
corners
interfered
with
municipal
ventilation
no
cleansing
winds
can
sweep
through
a
city
whose
every
street
ends
in
a
high
wall
outside
was
a
stagnant
moat
which
made
a
convenient
breeding
place
for
the
industrious
mosquito
the
local
market
used
to
be
a
community
dwelling
for
all
the
vendors
who
lived
there
reveling
in
their
filth
their
children
were
born
there
also
their
dogs
pigs
cats
and
chickens
it
was
so
vile
smelling
that
no
american
dared
go
into
it
never
being
cleaned
it
was
the
center
from
which
disease
was
spread
to
the
city
these
markets
were
the
first
places
to
be
cleaned
by
the
americans
the
first
step
was
always
to
burn
up
the
entire
shed
and
then
build
an
iron
and
concrete
structure
which
could
be
washed
down
every
night
with
a
hose
only
the
night
watchman
was
allowed
to
live
there
this
is
only
typical
of
changes
made
in
every
department
from
market
to
school
from
custom
house
to
palace
to
tell
a
long
story
very
shortly
gaps
have
been
opened
in
the
city
walls
to
let
in
the
air
the
moat
has
been
filled
in
with
soil
dredged
from
the
bay
to
make
a
field
for
sports
nearby
marshes
have
been
reclaimed
and
old
wells
filled
up
while
a
sewerage
system
and
a
method
of
collecting
refuse
have
of
course
been
established
the
new
water
system
has
cut
the
death
rate
from
diseases
in
half
to
stop
an
epidemic
whole
districts
of
huts
which
could
not
be
fumigated
were
burned
and
others
were
sprayed
with
strong
disinfectants
by
fire
engines
slowly
the
people
are
being
taught
the
rules
of
hygiene
the
new
and
medical
school
is
turning
out
very
good
doctors
and
the
school
of
nursing
most
excellent
nurses
who
are
gentle
cheerful
and
dainty
the
modern
hospitals
were
at
first
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
natives
who
went
with
the
greatest
reluctance
for
treatment
but
the
difficulty
is
to
keep
them
out
a
toothache
is
excuse
enough
for
a
week
sojourn
with
free
board
the
native
doctor
often
is
a
skilful
grafter
and
has
to
be
watched
otherwise
he
may
pass
in
all
his
poor
relations
more
to
give
them
food
and
rest
than
for
illness
a
friend
was
much
annoyed
while
sick
in
a
manila
hospital
by
some
filipina
girls
in
pink
and
lilac
hospital
gowns
who
were
romping
through
the
corridors
her
nurse
explained
that
they
were
passed
in
by
the
native
doctor
one
of
these
physicians
had
every
bed
in
his
ward
filled
with
patients
who
were
not
ill
but
just
enjoying
themselves
some
of
these
doctors
abuse
their
authority
in
other
ways
one
of
them
it
was
discovered
used
to
go
to
san
lazaro
the
hospital
for
contagious
diseases
and
take
friends
who
were
detained
there
with
leprosy
to
ride
in
public
vehicles
but
aside
from
occasional
abuses
by
natives
the
work
which
has
been
done
for
the
public
health
in
manila
is
an
example
of
what
has
been
accomplished
elsewhere
in
many
of
the
provincial
towns
the
introduction
of
artesian
wells
has
brought
the
death
rate
tumbling
down
to
half
its
former
size
the
work
was
carried
on
under
disadvantages
at
first
for
it
was
the
butt
of
much
ridicule
and
abuse
the
former
from
abroad
the
latter
from
the
native
press
medical
authorities
in
other
parts
of
the
far
east
laughed
at
our
efforts
to
create
better
conditions
for
the
filipinos
and
told
us
that
orientals
were
incapable
of
sanitary
reforms
before
long
these
same
men
were
seeking
to
learn
by
what
magic
we
had
accomplished
what
they
had
hardly
dared
even
attempt
and
were
sending
delegates
to
manila
to
study
our
methods
when
americans
went
there
they
found
the
filipinos
a
race
of
those
who
had
managed
to
survive
the
various
scourges
which
were
constantly
sweeping
the
islands
were
often
infected
with
hookworm
or
similar
parasites
which
sapped
their
vitality
many
of
them
were
tubercular
and
most
of
them
were
the
laziness
which
made
several
filipino
workmen
equal
to
one
american
was
much
of
it
due
to
actual
physical
weakness
as
a
people
they
are
showing
a
marked
improvement
in
energy
and
activity
it
was
from
changes
of
this
sort
that
the
benevolent
laboured
to
save
them
of
course
a
great
deal
remains
for
us
to
do
half
the
babies
still
die
before
they
are
a
year
old
only
a
beginning
has
been
made
in
stamping
out
tuberculosis
the
people
have
not
yet
been
educated
out
of
that
fatalism
which
makes
them
prefer
acceptance
of
evil
to
fighting
it
but
as
fast
as
they
learn
english
they
come
under
our
educative
influence
more
and
more
richard
strong
whom
we
knew
when
we
were
in
the
islands
and
who
is
now
at
the
harvard
medical
school
lecturing
on
tropical
diseases
has
done
many
notable
things
in
various
parts
of
the
world
we
all
know
about
his
wonderful
work
in
the
northern
part
of
china
when
the
pneumonic
plague
was
raging
there
a
few
years
ago
and
still
later
his
heroism
among
the
soldiers
of
serbia
but
we
do
not
all
know
that
among
other
things
he
has
discovered
a
cure
for
a
dreadful
skin
disease
called
yaws
which
has
been
prevalent
in
the
philippines
a
doctor
in
bontoc
cured
a
case
with
a
single
injection
of
salvarsan
the
case
was
so
delighted
that
he
escaped
from
the
hospital
before
a
second
injection
could
be
given
him
rushed
home
to
his
native
village
and
returned
a
day
or
so
later
with
a
dozen
or
more
of
his
neighbours
who
were
suffering
from
the
same
trouble
we
were
fortunate
in
traveling
through
the
islands
with
heiser
who
had
entire
control
of
the
health
conditions
there
for
many
years
in
fact
until
the
democratic
administration
to
him
is
largely
due
the
practical
disappearance
of
smallpox
from
the
philippines
when
the
americans
took
over
the
country
there
were
sometimes
over
fifty
thousand
deaths
a
year
from
this
one
disease
the
change
is
the
direct
result
of
the
ten
million
vaccinations
which
were
performed
by
american
officials
an
effort
was
made
to
entrust
the
vaccinating
to
filipino
officials
but
epidemics
kept
breaking
out
and
it
was
discovered
that
their
work
was
being
done
chiefly
on
paper
in
a
recent
letter
a
friend
writes
the
other
day
one
of
our
servants
crispin
was
ill
i
tried
to
get
him
to
go
to
the
hospital
but
he
insisted
he
was
not
sick
i
did
not
enjoy
having
him
wait
on
the
table
for
i
thought
he
had
measles
so
i
took
him
to
the
hospital
myself
and
told
him
to
do
what
the
doctor
said
when
i
returned
home
a
telephone
call
summoned
us
to
the
hospital
to
be
vaccinated
at
once
for
crispin
had
the
smallpox
they
sent
him
to
san
lazaro
where
he
had
a
good
time
and
came
home
smiling
while
we
spent
a
miserable
ten
days
waiting
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
to
us
the
native
came
promptly
to
disinfect
but
all
they
did
was
to
put
a
bucket
of
something
in
the
center
of
the
room
i
soon
saw
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
thorough
so
after
ten
minutes
just
as
they
were
going
away
i
called
them
back
and
telephoned
to
the
board
of
health
asking
if
no
american
sanitary
officer
was
coming
they
said
no
that
filipinos
had
been
put
in
all
the
white
men
places
so
i
went
to
work
myself
burning
bedding
clothes
and
hangings
and
opening
every
trunk
and
closet
it
was
a
revelation
to
those
two
little
natives
who
thought
they
had
done
enough
before
apparently
the
natives
had
the
same
aversion
to
the
preventive
method
of
vaccination
that
some
of
our
own
countryfolk
have
for
heiser
writes
of
the
early
work
in
the
field
formerly
the
lives
of
the
vaccinators
were
seriously
threatened
by
persons
who
refused
to
be
vaccinated
however
after
much
persuasion
a
considerable
number
of
the
inhabitants
were
vaccinated
shortly
afterwards
smallpox
was
introduced
and
the
death
rate
among
the
unvaccinated
became
alarming
the
people
themselves
then
noted
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
vaccinated
persons
frequently
came
in
constant
contact
with
the
disease
they
did
not
contract
it
while
the
unvaccinated
died
in
large
numbers
this
led
to
urgent
request
being
made
for
vaccination
and
the
vaccinators
who
previously
found
their
lives
in
constant
danger
were
welcomed
but
perhaps
heiser
greatest
work
has
been
done
in
freeing
the
islands
of
the
disease
of
all
times
and
nations
leprosy
i
was
walking
along
the
street
with
him
one
day
when
he
noticed
the
swollen
ear
lobes
of
a
man
near
by
it
was
one
of
the
first
symptoms
of
leprosy
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
the
man
and
walked
with
him
to
the
hospital
the
disease
is
not
really
so
much
to
be
feared
as
people
think
for
it
is
seldom
inherited
and
is
not
easily
contagious
we
had
planned
to
go
to
culion
the
beautiful
island
where
thousands
of
lepers
have
been
taken
to
live
or
to
die
and
where
they
have
every
care
and
comfort
that
science
and
unselfish
devotion
can
give
them
unfortunately
for
us
the
secretary
of
war
was
obliged
to
cut
the
trip
short
owing
to
official
business
in
manila
so
we
did
not
go
there
we
heard
so
much
about
the
place
that
this
was
a
real
disappointment
the
island
is
a
day
sail
from
manila
it
is
well
forested
and
has
hills
and
fertile
valleys
and
a
fine
harbour
the
more
important
buildings
of
the
town
which
the
authorities
knew
would
be
needed
by
the
thousands
of
lepers
then
at
large
were
built
from
the
foundations
entirely
of
concrete
for
sanitary
reasons
and
economy
besides
hundreds
of
houses
one
finds
there
a
theater
a
town
hall
a
school
dining
halls
hospitals
stores
docks
and
warehouses
water
lighting
and
sewerage
systems
were
also
constructed
and
a
separate
settlement
was
built
for
the
employees
culion
is
really
a
leper
heaven
the
people
have
perfect
freedom
and
live
normal
lives
farming
or
fishing
when
they
are
able
carrying
on
their
own
government
having
their
own
police
force
playing
in
the
band
if
they
are
musical
giving
theatrical
performances
they
have
social
distinctions
too
those
better
born
take
the
place
denied
them
in
the
outer
world
because
of
their
affliction
here
they
are
again
somebody
when
americans
took
possession
of
the
islands
there
were
six
thousand
lepers
at
large
two
things
evidently
had
to
be
done
first
prevent
a
further
spread
of
the
disease
and
second
cure
those
who
already
had
it
if
this
were
possible
segregation
of
all
known
cases
as
fast
as
accommodations
could
be
provided
for
them
was
the
immediate
necessity
the
colony
at
culion
was
opened
in
with
five
hundred
patients
these
went
reluctantly
to
their
new
abode
but
once
settled
there
found
it
so
much
to
their
liking
that
they
wrote
home
enthusiastically
and
after
that
the
authorities
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
others
to
go
indeed
the
plight
of
these
poor
outcasts
had
been
pitiful
enough
they
were
so
neglected
that
in
one
of
the
larger
cities
they
had
been
known
to
go
into
the
markets
and
handle
the
produce
as
a
protest
against
their
treatment
more
than
eight
thousand
have
been
transferred
to
culion
in
all
and
every
known
leper
in
the
philippines
is
there
new
cases
are
still
occasionally
found
but
even
the
worst
provinces
are
now
practically
free
from
the
historic
scourge
it
was
that
remarkable
man
heiser
who
not
only
organized
and
carried
out
this
great
undertaking
but
who
himself
saw
to
the
smallest
details
many
times
he
is
known
to
have
carried
the
loathsome
patients
in
his
own
arms
the
second
problem
that
of
finding
a
cure
was
not
so
easily
solved
but
it
has
been
found
and
our
nation
had
the
credit
of
finding
it
the
first
definite
cure
ever
established
heiser
says
two
methods
were
tried
out
very
carefully
both
with
some
success
the
first
was
the
which
brought
a
marked
improvement
in
most
of
the
cases
where
it
was
used
and
an
apparent
cure
in
one
case
the
other
method
was
the
use
of
chaulmoogra
oil
this
remedy
had
been
known
and
used
in
the
far
east
for
some
time
but
it
could
rarely
be
given
long
enough
to
produce
much
effect
because
it
was
so
unpleasant
to
swallow
our
doctors
however
devised
ways
of
injecting
it
after
mixing
it
with
resorcin
and
camphorated
oil
so
that
there
were
no
ill
effects
already
several
cures
have
resulted
ten
years
ago
there
were
forty
thousand
users
of
opium
in
the
islands
in
five
years
that
number
was
reduced
per
cent
and
most
of
those
still
addicted
to
the
drug
are
chinese
in
the
last
few
years
moreover
cholera
and
bubonic
plague
have
been
practically
wiped
out
but
of
course
a
few
other
tropical
diseases
still
exist
the
philippine
assembly
recently
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
cutting
down
expenses
by
halving
the
health
appropriation
heiser
got
permission
to
speak
before
them
but
instead
of
talking
a
few
minutes
as
they
expected
he
spoke
for
three
days
he
told
them
that
if
they
did
not
give
him
the
money
he
needed
for
the
work
he
would
be
forced
to
economize
by
setting
free
the
criminally
insane
who
he
promised
should
be
given
tags
stating
that
they
had
been
set
free
by
order
of
the
assembly
also
he
said
he
would
have
to
send
back
many
of
the
lepers
to
their
friends
it
proved
to
be
the
way
to
deal
with
the
legislators
who
in
the
end
gave
him
what
he
wanted
since
that
however
he
has
resigned
and
his
loss
will
be
sadly
felt
indeed
there
has
already
been
an
outbreak
of
cholera
since
he
left
regenerative
work
among
the
filipinos
has
by
no
means
been
confined
to
their
bodies
however
for
besides
the
educational
advance
that
has
been
made
in
their
schools
which
i
have
mentioned
elsewhere
their
prisons
have
become
sources
of
light
instead
of
darkness
it
is
true
that
penology
in
the
philippines
has
gone
ahead
with
great
strides
in
bontoc
for
instance
there
is
a
prison
which
the
commissioner
in
charge
of
the
province
proudly
called
his
university
its
inmates
are
men
of
the
mountains
in
the
old
days
they
would
have
been
sent
to
bilibid
prison
in
manila
where
few
of
them
lived
over
two
years
a
longer
term
meant
practically
a
death
sentence
this
provincial
jail
is
situated
in
the
high
and
healthy
capital
of
the
province
and
is
kept
clean
and
sanitary
by
the
prisoners
themselves
the
men
are
well
fed
and
cared
for
and
they
are
taught
trades
and
made
to
work
at
them
too
so
that
they
learn
industry
along
with
technical
skill
bilibid
prison
is
a
huge
institution
it
occupies
several
acres
of
land
in
the
heart
of
the
city
of
manila
its
buildings
radiating
from
a
common
center
so
that
the
guard
in
the
high
tower
at
the
hub
can
overlook
anything
that
occurs
high
walls
surround
the
whole
patrolled
by
watchful
guards
and
mounted
with
gatling
guns
it
is
an
extraordinary
institution
inherited
from
spanish
rule
but
like
everything
else
completely
changed
since
then
the
wives
of
men
committed
there
were
considered
widowed
in
those
days
since
so
few
survived
a
long
term
and
were
free
to
marry
again
there
has
been
some
confusion
of
late
years
because
most
of
the
prisoners
not
only
come
out
alive
but
healthier
than
when
they
went
in
so
prison
widows
who
remarried
found
that
they
had
not
counted
on
american
methods
bilibid
though
in
many
ways
still
rather
experimental
is
a
great
success
there
are
extensive
shops
and
the
prisoners
are
kept
at
work
all
the
time
some
make
silverware
carriages
and
furniture
while
others
do
the
cooking
and
washing
for
the
prison
make
their
clothes
and
run
a
laundry
not
only
for
their
own
use
but
for
outside
custom
many
are
employed
in
road
building
and
on
fortifications
each
man
learns
a
trade
during
his
term
of
imprisonment
and
so
is
better
able
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
than
when
he
entered
i
have
been
told
that
bilibid
graduates
are
in
demand
because
of
their
honesty
and
industry
no
better
recommendation
for
a
prison
could
be
desired
besides
the
shops
there
is
a
school
in
which
they
are
taught
english
the
day
we
visited
the
prison
we
saw
a
teacher
there
who
had
been
a
guest
at
the
governor
table
but
as
he
had
forged
a
check
he
was
paying
the
penalty
most
of
the
attendants
in
the
prison
hospital
were
spaniards
who
were
in
for
life
sentences
and
who
made
very
good
nurses
part
of
this
institution
is
devoted
to
consumptives
of
whom
there
are
so
many
in
the
islands
and
they
receive
treatment
according
to
the
best
and
latest
methods
illustration
penal
colony
on
the
island
of
palawan
we
were
much
interested
in
the
kitchens
and
the
manner
in
which
food
was
issued
to
several
thousands
in
only
six
minutes
it
was
all
wonderfully
systematized
late
in
the
afternoon
we
went
up
into
the
central
tower
to
watch
the
retreat
the
prisoners
band
which
had
played
for
us
as
we
entered
the
prison
gates
now
took
its
place
in
the
courtyard
below
and
began
to
play
out
of
the
workrooms
trooped
hundreds
of
convicts
who
were
searched
for
hidden
implements
and
then
released
to
take
their
position
in
military
formation
the
different
groups
marched
to
their
quarters
and
standing
outside
went
through
a
series
of
exercises
to
the
music
of
the
band
they
seemed
to
enjoy
this
very
much
and
later
still
to
the
music
marched
gaily
off
to
get
their
rations
a
prisoner
with
two
years
of
good
conduct
to
his
credit
is
given
the
privilege
of
going
to
the
penal
colony
on
the
island
of
palawan
this
island
is
one
of
the
more
southern
ones
and
is
the
place
where
the
spanish
sent
their
convicts
in
the
old
days
but
the
present
colony
which
was
established
by
governor
forbes
is
very
different
from
the
former
one
it
was
once
a
malarial
jungle
but
now
is
a
healthy
thoroughly
and
successful
reform
institution
our
visit
to
this
place
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
our
whole
trip
palawan
itself
is
a
curiosity
for
it
has
an
underground
river
which
has
been
explored
for
two
miles
beneath
a
mountain
but
the
penal
settlement
is
unique
leaving
the
steamer
at
puerto
princessa
a
quaint
little
town
with
charming
old
spanish
gardens
we
were
met
by
a
launch
which
took
us
up
the
iwahig
river
to
the
colony
this
launch
which
was
gaily
decked
with
flags
was
manned
by
convicts
the
engineer
himself
being
under
a
sentence
of
nineteen
years
for
murder
after
an
hour
sail
up
the
tropical
river
we
reached
our
destination
at
the
wharf
we
were
greeted
by
lamb
superintendent
of
the
colony
a
dominican
priest
and
a
crowd
of
prisoners
who
were
enjoying
a
holiday
we
were
driven
to
headquarters
near
a
pretty
plaza
with
hedges
and
flowers
surrounded
by
several
barracks
built
of
bamboo
and
nipa
where
the
prisoners
live
as
we
walked
about
the
plaza
we
visited
the
hospital
and
the
chapel
as
well
as
the
main
office
and
the
superintendent
house
the
penal
settlement
is
located
on
a
reservation
of
two
hundred
and
seventy
square
miles
at
the
time
of
our
visit
there
were
in
all
eleven
hundred
convicts
filipinos
for
the
most
part
with
a
few
moros
and
only
three
white
men
to
keep
them
in
order
the
prisoners
had
all
come
from
bilibid
prison
in
its
management
the
colony
is
somewhat
like
the
george
junior
republic
for
boys
in
america
the
prisoners
elect
their
own
judges
and
make
some
of
their
own
laws
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
superintendent
a
majority
verdict
will
convict
but
the
superintendent
has
the
right
to
veto
any
measures
men
who
break
the
laws
are
locked
up
but
can
be
released
on
bail
the
police
force
is
composed
of
convicts
of
course
the
chief
of
police
when
we
were
there
was
a
murderer
who
had
earned
his
pardon
but
preferred
to
remain
in
the
settlement
if
a
prisoner
tries
to
escape
he
is
followed
and
occasionally
one
is
shot
the
attempt
is
seldom
made
for
it
is
difficult
to
get
away
and
the
men
are
moreover
quite
content
to
live
there
once
convicts
did
make
a
break
for
liberty
but
beyond
the
confines
of
the
settlement
they
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
savage
mangyans
by
whom
some
were
killed
of
the
rest
those
who
were
not
captured
alive
returned
of
their
own
free
will
and
were
consigned
again
to
bilibid
which
is
considered
a
great
punishment
for
good
behaviour
convicts
may
earn
the
right
to
have
a
house
of
their
own
with
their
family
one
bull
or
carabao
and
a
little
farm
to
cultivate
there
were
then
a
hundred
and
eighty
of
these
farmers
who
raised
their
crops
on
shares
the
government
receiving
half
they
had
to
report
to
headquarters
by
telephone
every
other
day
and
undergo
a
weekly
inspection
as
well
every
year
they
were
obliged
to
plant
cocoanuts
which
in
a
few
years
were
expected
to
bring
in
large
returns
already
great
quantities
of
yams
were
being
shipped
to
bilibid
and
in
a
short
time
enough
cattle
would
be
delivered
there
to
supply
in
part
at
least
the
meat
demand
of
that
prison
the
colony
suggests
the
possible
solution
of
the
meat
question
for
the
american
army
in
the
philippines
as
they
were
successfully
raising
calves
from
native
cows
by
indian
bulls
although
the
majority
of
the
prisoners
were
engaged
in
farming
they
were
often
given
the
privilege
of
selecting
the
kind
of
work
that
they
preferred
and
were
divided
accordingly
their
hats
and
the
signs
on
the
sleeves
of
their
prison
clothes
showing
what
grade
of
convict
they
belonged
to
and
what
work
they
did
they
were
paid
in
the
money
of
the
colony
which
was
good
nowhere
else
there
were
about
forty
women
on
the
reservation
the
men
might
marry
if
they
earned
the
privilege
or
if
already
married
they
might
have
their
wives
and
children
come
to
live
with
them
there
were
six
marriages
the
year
we
were
there
after
receiving
their
pardons
they
could
remain
on
the
island
if
they
wished
their
work
being
credited
toward
the
purchase
of
their
farms
but
they
had
to
continue
under
the
laws
of
the
colony
at
the
main
office
we
saw
four
prisoners
who
were
about
to
be
pardoned
governor
forbes
very
kindly
asked
me
to
hand
them
their
pardons
and
ask
any
questions
i
wished
one
a
or
brigand
was
small
and
wizened
another
who
looked
much
like
him
when
asked
what
crime
he
had
committed
laughed
and
answered
bigamy
a
third
a
stolid
thickset
fellow
had
the
best
face
of
them
all
but
showed
no
emotion
whatever
when
i
gave
him
his
pardon
he
also
had
been
a
brigand
the
convicts
gave
an
exhibition
fire
drill
for
us
at
the
barracks
the
natives
are
born
climbers
and
scramble
down
the
poles
with
the
agility
of
monkeys
they
also
play
baseball
of
course
they
are
remarkably
musical
and
have
a
good
band
we
had
luncheon
with
and
lamb
in
their
pretty
bamboo
and
nipa
cottage
lamb
was
a
frail
little
woman
but
strong
in
spirit
for
she
did
not
seem
at
all
afraid
to
live
in
this
land
of
evil
men
she
told
us
that
the
three
murderers
whom
she
had
as
servants
were
very
efficient
and
were
devoted
to
her
little
son
when
our
visit
ended
we
were
driven
in
a
wagon
to
the
river
accompanied
by
a
troop
of
prisoners
who
ran
alongside
shouting
at
the
wharf
they
lined
up
while
lamb
and
the
priest
bowed
us
politely
aboard
the
launch
these
intrepid
countrymen
of
ours
who
are
healing
and
uplifting
a
whole
people
seem
to
me
to
be
true
missionaries
the
time
may
come
when
the
work
which
they
are
doing
will
set
a
standard
for
us
to
follow
that
is
if
we
send
the
right
kind
of
men
out
there
as
the
song
says
ah
those
were
the
days
when
the
best
men
won
the
survival
of
those
that
were
fit
when
the
work
to
be
done
counted
everything
and
politics
nary
a
bit
chapter
vi
and
others
the
natives
of
the
philippines
are
malays
as
i
have
said
but
they
are
sometimes
classified
as
christian
pagan
and
mohammedan
malays
the
christian
and
educated
tribes
live
near
the
coast
on
the
lowlands
and
are
called
filipinos
they
have
intermarried
greatly
with
the
spaniards
and
chinese
there
are
tribes
in
the
islands
about
four
hundred
thousand
in
number
in
the
mountain
province
of
luzon
alone
these
hill
people
are
seldom
seen
although
during
the
last
few
years
most
of
the
tribes
have
come
under
government
influence
and
has
been
more
or
less
given
up
these
dwellers
in
the
mountains
include
the
aborigines
who
were
driven
out
of
the
valleys
by
the
malays
and
also
the
malays
of
the
earlier
migration
who
refused
to
embrace
the
mohammedanism
of
the
moros
of
the
southern
islands
or
the
christianity
of
the
spaniards
we
were
fortunate
in
having
the
opportunity
to
see
some
of
the
and
other
hill
people
our
party
was
divided
and
while
several
of
the
men
went
into
the
heart
of
the
country
the
rest
of
us
took
the
train
to
baguio
the
mountain
capital
what
a
night
it
was
the
heat
was
frightful
and
swarms
of
mosquitoes
added
to
the
torture
but
at
sunrise
as
i
sat
on
the
back
platform
while
the
train
steamed
through
rows
of
cocoanut
palms
past
little
huts
and
stations
i
was
reminded
of
this
verse
mighty
luminous
and
calm
is
the
country
of
the
palm
crowned
with
sunset
and
sunrise
under
blue
unbroken
skies
waving
from
green
zone
to
zone
over
wonders
of
its
own
trackless
untraversed
unknown
changeless
through
the
centuries
leaving
the
tropics
behind
we
climbed
up
up
among
the
glorious
mountains
at
last
the
train
stopped
at
a
little
station
and
we
took
the
motors
that
were
waiting
and
went
on
higher
and
higher
into
cloudland
where
the
tall
pines
grew
and
the
mountains
rose
into
the
sky
we
had
indeed
ascended
into
paradise
from
purgatory
as
one
resident
in
manila
expressed
it
the
heavenly
coolness
the
sweet
pine
air
and
the
exquisite
scenery
give
you
new
life
after
the
years
spent
in
the
heat
glare
dust
and
smells
of
the
lowlands
illustration
the
party
at
baguio
we
were
passing
over
the
benguet
road
one
of
the
finest
highways
in
the
world
which
wound
in
and
out
through
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
repeatedly
crossing
the
river
that
roared
beneath
for
twenty
miles
we
zigzagged
up
the
slopes
with
widening
views
of
great
hills
opening
before
us
and
cascades
bursting
out
from
beneath
the
mountains
till
we
came
out
on
the
plateau
of
baguio
five
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
this
road
which
has
been
a
favourite
theme
for
discussion
by
politicians
was
opened
to
traffic
in
it
is
true
that
the
cost
of
the
roadway
was
beyond
what
anybody
had
anticipated
on
account
of
the
many
bridges
that
had
to
be
repaired
each
year
after
the
rainy
season
and
also
after
the
destructive
typhoons
that
sweep
over
the
island
one
in
brought
a
rainfall
of
inches
in
hours
which
hurl
avalanches
of
débris
from
the
mountain
slopes
for
this
reason
a
new
road
from
bauang
to
baguio
has
been
commenced
not
nearly
so
direct
but
requiring
only
a
few
bridges
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
prove
successful
and
more
economical
than
the
other
baguio
in
the
midst
of
glorious
mountain
scenery
where
the
temperature
never
goes
above
eighty
and
the
nights
are
deliciously
cool
really
is
an
ideal
health
resort
for
a
tropical
country
the
philippines
have
worcester
and
forbes
to
thank
for
this
blessing
government
buildings
were
erected
and
the
whole
force
of
the
government
was
moved
up
there
for
the
hot
season
with
the
rich
return
of
the
improved
health
and
greater
efficiency
of
the
employees
a
hospital
for
tuberculosis
was
built
and
a
much
needed
school
for
american
children
the
jesuit
observatory
was
established
and
camp
john
hay
was
laid
out
as
a
permanent
military
post
many
people
bought
land
and
put
up
little
bungalows
a
teachers
camp
was
started
by
the
bureau
of
education
for
american
teachers
from
all
over
the
islands
where
they
had
not
only
rest
and
recreation
but
the
mental
brushing
up
of
good
lectures
after
months
in
lonely
stations
when
the
democratic
administration
began
its
changes
in
the
philippines
government
offices
were
ordered
to
be
kept
in
manila
throughout
the
year
consequently
only
the
higher
officials
were
able
to
go
to
baguio
with
a
result
patent
to
every
one
in
the
lessened
efficiency
of
the
force
but
within
the
last
two
or
three
years
the
filipinos
have
come
to
appreciate
the
place
which
was
a
revelation
to
them
now
rich
and
poor
manage
to
go
there
and
they
have
taken
possession
the
benefits
of
baguio

the
benguet

are
felt
even
in

where
americans
are
beginning
to
get

a
friend
writes
if
the
time
ever
comes
when
we
can
have
real
cow
milk
and
cream
then
our
food
will
be
as
good
as
anywhere

rode

in

through

squash

and
other
delightful

were
given
to
the
native
ponies
which
are
small
but
very
strong
we
went
to
the
government
stock
farm
where
they
are
trying
experiments
in
breeding
horses
they
had
a
native
pony
there
that
had
been
well
fed
and
taken
care
of
for
some
time
in
order
to
show
the
difference
between
it
and
the
forlorn
animals
that
one
might
see
anywhere
in
the
towns
the
native
spanish
pony
has
greatly
degenerated
at
this
farm
they
had
a
beautiful
arabian
stallion
and
a
morgan
stallion
from
vermont
it
is
said
that
the
first
generation
of
american
horses
does
well
in
the
philippines
but
after
that
the
climate
and
the
change
in
food
cause
them
to
deteriorate
besides
they
are
rather
too
big
for
mountain
cavalry
the
arabian
stallion
and
the
native
mare
are
said
to
breed
the
best
kind
of

pretty
things
they
make
these
girls
wear
short
blue
skirts
and
little
jackets
and
have
their
hair
in
two
long
black
braids
that
hang
on
either
side
of
their
faces
a
turkish
towel
worn
as
a
turban
on
which
to
rest
burdens
seemed
to
be
the
fashion
in
head
gear
with
them
loads
are
also
carried
by
the
igorots
on
their
backs
hung
by
straps
over
the
forehead
it
was
an
igorot
child
in
this
school
who
wrote
the
following
article
upon
dickinson
visit
at
baguio
it
was
yesterday
morning
very
early
when
we
started
from
here
to
the
post
office
to
meet
a
lady
named
dickinson
so
early
we
all
went
down
the
brook
to
take
our
bath
after
we
had
taken
our
bath
we
had
breakfast
i
was
late
so
ina
scolded
me
but
i
am
glad
she
did
it
so
that
some
day
i
wo
do
it
again
then
we
were
all
line
up
in
two
by
two
when
we
got
up
to
the
post
office
she
was
not
there
so
we
waited
for
her
an
hour
or
two
after
waiting
for
them
they
arrived
suddenly
there
were
some
ladies
who
accompanied
dickinson
we
were
very
much
pleased
to
see
her
and
she
was
much
pleased
too
the
first
time
that
she
came
in
the
philippine
islands
from
america
and
she
is
soprice
surprised
we
sang
three
songs
and
the
national
anthem
and
waving
our
flags
on
the
road
when
we
finished
singing
they
clapped
their
hands
i
gave
her
a
bouquet
of
pink
flowers
this
we
did
it
for
our
honour
of
dickinson
not
because
she
is
more
kind
or
lovely
lady
but
because
she
is
the
wife
of
dickinson
this
secretary
of
war
is
the
leader
of
those
who
have
authorities
he
is
responsible
of
them
after
that
we
came
right
back
miss
came
for
school
we
cleaned
the
schoolroom
and
the
yard
so
that
they
will
be
so
tidy
when
they
come
to
see
the
school
at
three
we
fixed
the
two
bridges
and
we
trimmed
the
road
little
bit
for
their
automobiles
to
dance
on
but
they
left
them
on
the
road
yonder
because
they
afraid
might
the
bridges
will
do
them
damage
so
they
walked
from
there
to
here
and
when
they
went
back
they
walked
from
here
to
there
again
making
them
a
journey

the

took
me
one
day
to
the
tombs
of
the
igorots
high
on
the
hills
looking
toward
the
sea
are
great
natural
rocks
with
cracks
in
them
one
of
which
looked
like
the
sphinx
here
we
got
off
our
ponies
tied
them
and
entered
on
foot
a
tangled
path
leading
to
a
cavern
in
the
faint
light
that
sifted
through
we
saw
a
coffin
some
baskets
and
some
hats
and
farther
on
concealed
and
yet
overlooking
a
fine
view
were
more
wooden
coffins
some
of
these
had
fallen
apart
so
that
we
could
see
the
remains
of
bones
and
clothes
when
an
igorot
dies
the
body
is
usually
tied
in
a
sitting
position
on
the
top
of
a
pole
in
the
house
and
smoked
for
several
days
over
a
fire
built
underneath
it
meanwhile
the
family
kill
and
cook
all
the
pigs
and
carabaos
and
ponies
if
the
man
owned
any
and
then
gather
around
and
have
what
they
call
a
or
feast
afterward
the
bones
and
skulls
of
the
carabaos
are
hung
about
the
house
to
show
their
neighbours
what
a
rich
man
he
was
some
of
us
went
one
day
to
mirador
the
typhoon
station
on
a
high
hill
overlooking
the
sea
it
is
in
charge
of
a
jesuit
priest
who
predicts
the
approach
of
typhoons
and
puts
up
storm
signals
in
this
way
preventing
great
loss
of
life
we
were
shown
the
instruments
which
give
warning
of
earthquakes
as
well
as
typhoons
and
given
sherry
that
was
fifty
years
old
delicious
cake
and
flowers
from
his
garden
and
we
saw
his
goats
climbing
up
the
steep
crags
he
told
us
with
a
chuckle
that
he
had
traded
his
dog
to
an
igorot
for
a
cow
on
sunday
we
visited
the
dog
market
but
alas
we
saw
no
dogs
as
on
account
of
cholera
in
the
vicinity
it
was
forbidden
to
sell
any
a
few
days
before
we
had
seen
several
men
leading
a
number
of
lean
and
lanky
ones
along
the
road
and
these
were
all
for
sale

be
killed

they
proved
to
be
the

men
who
had
put
on
what

they
possessed
for
this
occasion
they
were
brown
men
with

they
call
the
woven
cloth
hanging
about

waists
some
had
coats
on

nothing

and
remind

of
our
american
indians
they
are
peaceful
farmers
now
but
in
days
gone
by
they
fought
their
neighbours
on
the
north
and
so
lances
and
shields
are
still
to
be
found
among
them
the
first
american
civil
provincial
government
established
in
the
philippines
was
in
benguet
and
governmental
control
has
been
continuously
exercised
there
since
november
they
are
gladly
availing
themselves
of
the
opportunity
now
afforded
for
the
education
of
their
children
but
insist
that
this
education
be
practical
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
had
been
made
in
the
philippines
a
party
of
igorots
were
brought
to
the
louis
exposition
part
of
the
exhibit
was
a
model
schoolroom
visitors
were
amazed
at
the
bright
eager
little
children
and
at
their
keen
interest
in
their
lessons
but
they
were
even
more
amazed
one
day
to
see
these
same
model
pupils
when
a
dog
suddenly
barked
outside
for
the
school
simply
went
to
pieces
the
children
making
for
the
nearest
door
the
last
seen
of
them
they
were
in
full
cry
after
the
unfortunate
dog
although
we
found
the
interesting
there
are
other
tribes
of
far
greater
interest
such
as
the
negritos
the
warlike
ilongots
and
the
tingians
as
well
as
the
people
of
the
bashee
rocks
of
the
north
who
are
hardly
ever
seen
the
negritos
are
diminutive
and
uncivilized
black
people
who
live
in
a
few
mountain
areas
they
are
the
aborigines
of
the
islands
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
are
as
primitive
as
the
australian
blacks
having
no
social
or
political
organization
but
that
of
the
family
they
live
in
hollow
trees
or
under
little
of
grass
and
brush
and
subsist
principally
by
hunting
and
fishing
at
which
they
are
very
expert
their
weapons
are
poisoned
arrows
and
the
blow
gun
the
poison
which
is
made
either
from
the
leaf
of
a
tree
or
from
decomposed
meat
is
placed
in
the
of
hollow
bone
on
striking
it
injects
the
poison
into
the
flesh
as
a
hypodermic
needle
would
do
quickly
resulting
in
death
the
only
agricultural
implement
of
the
negritos
is
a
pointed
stick
hardened
in
the
fire
to
prepare
the
ground
for
cultivation
on
the
space
they
wish
to
clear
they
girdle
the
trees
which
will
soon
die
they
are
then
set
on
fire
and
the
ashes
distributed
over
the
soil
later
holes
are
made
with
the
pointed
sticks
and
and
tobacco
are
planted
these
people
are
very
timid
and
if
their
suspicions
are
aroused
in
the
slightest
manner
they
immediately
disappear
into
the
forest
very
little
success
has
attended
any
effort
to
civilize
them
their
religion
is
nature
worship
with
many
local
divinities
and
good
and
bad
spirits
of
all
sorts
they
ornament
their
bodies
with
scar
patterns
made
by
cutting
the
skin
with
sharp
pieces
of
bamboo
and
then
rubbing
dirt
into
the
wounds
in
this
respect
they
are
like
no
other
tribes
in
the
islands
but
resemble
the
most
primitive
of
the
native
africans
who
also
make
scar
patterns
the
men
often
shave
the
crowns
of
their
heads
in
order
they
say
to
let
the
heat
out
the
negritos
like
the
bagobos
of
the
south
sometimes
point
their
front
teeth
but
not
by
filing
them
as
one
might
suppose
they
are
chopped
off
with
a
bolo
worcester
says
the
negritos
believe
that
each
family
must
take
at
least
one
head
per
year
or
suffer
misfortune
in
the
form
of
sickness
wounds
starvation
or
death
heads
are
buried
in
the
ground
under
the
houses
of
the
men
who
take
them
in
regard
to
the
tingians
of
northern
luzon
i
also
quote
from
worcester
who
has
given
us
the
most
reliable
account
of
them
the
women
of
this
tribe
ornament
their
arms
with
a
series
of
bracelets
and
armlets
which
often
extend
from
wrist
to
shoulder
they
constrict
the
middle
of
the
forearm
during
early
girlhood
and
continue
to
wear
tight
armlets
on
the
constricted
portion
throughout
life
so
that
their
forearms
become
somewhat
this
being
considered
a
mark
of
great
beauty
in
spite
of
the
unsightly
swelling
of
the
wrists
which
results
their
cooking
utensils
are
taken
to
the
river
and
scrubbed
with
sand
after
every
meal
if
a
wife
offers
her
husband
dirty
or
soggy
rice
to
eat
the
offense
is
said
to
afford
ground
for
divorce
when
a
man
dies
whether
his
death
be
natural
or
due
to
violence
the
other
members
of
his
family
repair
by
night
to
some
village
of
their
enemies
cut
pieces
from
their
turbans
and
throw
them
down
on
the
ground
this
is
interpreted
as
an
intimation
that
they
will
return
and
take
heads
sometime
within
six
months
and
they
believe
that
the
dead
man
knows
no
peace
until
this
is
done
the
ilongots
who
live
in
the
province
of
nueva
viscaya
are
especially
wild

are

no
young
man
can
take
to
himself
a
bride
until
he
has
brought
back
a
head
to
prove
his
prowess
the
favourite
time
for
these
gruesome
excursions
of
the
tribe
is
when
the
blossoms
of
the
fire
tree
show
their
red
beacons
on
the
mountain
sides
as
an
especial
mark
of
beauty
and
valour
because
a
good
deal
of
pain
has
to
be
endured
in
the
process

most
of
the
mountain
people
still
retain
their
ancient
myths
and
traditions
even
among
these
ilongots
there
are
tales
of
the
long
ago
when
they
came
across
a
great
water
to
their
present
abode
this
of
course
merely
explains
the
general
migration
of
the
malay
tribes
by
the
way
this
malay
migration
is
still
in
progress
and
is
exemplified
by
the
samal
boatmen
who
come
from
borneo
and
further
south
in
malaysia
to
the
southern
philippines
all
the
wild
people
have
customs
of
their
own
which
distinguish
them
especially
the
manner
in
which
they
cut
their
hair
and
wear
their
loin
cloths
they
have
slightly
different
methods
of
fighting
some
fighting
singly
with
a
kind
of
sword
others
in
pairs
with
spears
and
arrows
while
the
sword
is
used
only
to
decapitate
the
fallen
enemy
others
display
considerable
ability
in
organization
and
operate
large
bands
under
especially
designated
chiefs
all
are
very
fond
of
dancing
and
have
different
dances
to
represent
war
love
and
the
chase
they
have
their
own
explanations
for
everything
and
their
stories
about
the
creation
of
the
various
birds
and
animals
are
quite
interesting
and
not
unlike
those
found
among
some
tribes
of
aborigines
in
north
america
one
of
them
relates
that
one
day
the
creator
was
making
the
different
birds
before
him
lay
bodies
wings
necks
heads
and
feet
he
would
begin
with
the
body
and
build
it
up
with
appropriate
parts
so
that
it
could
apply
itself
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
in
every
case
the
creator
was
particular
not
to
put
on
the
wings
before
the
bird
was
complete
for
fear
that
it
would
take
flight
in
an
imperfect
condition
one
day
while
he
was
engaged
in
making
an
especially
fine
specimen
of
the
feathered
world
the
evil
spirit
approached
and
engaged
the
good
spirit
in
conversation
ordinarily
he
would
have
attacked
the
evil
one
and
quickly
put
him
to
flight
but
as
the
bird
was
nearly
finished
and
already
imbued
with
the
spark
of
life
he
wished
to
complete
him
but
the
creator
anger
that
the
evil
one
should
overlook
his
work
became
so
great
that
without
thinking
he
put
on
the
wings
before
the
legs
had
been
fitted
instantly
the
bird
flew
off
in
haste
the
creator
grabbed
the
first
pair
of
legs
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
threw
them
at
it
they
attached
themselves
exactly
where
they
struck
the
bird
near
the
tail
this
is
the
reason
so
the
story
goes
that
the
loon
legs
are
so
far
back
that
he
can
not
walk
in
an
upright
position
on
land
his
peculiarly
sad
cry
is
a
lament
because
he
must
stay
in
the
water
practically
all
the
time
and
can
not
enjoy
himself
on
land
as
other
good
birds
do

ilongots
returning
from

many
of
the
people
who
live
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
ranges
although
christianized
sufficiently
to
contribute
to
the
roman

still
retain
many
of
their
aboriginal
customs

those
pertaining

hundred
miles
is
an
interesting
archipelago
of
diminutive
islands
known
as
the
bashee

the
batan
and
the
babuyan
islands
the
natives
still
retain
many
of
the
characteristics
which
were
observed
by
dampier
in
his
visit
to
these
islands
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
inhabitants
of
the
batan
group
are
like
those
living
on
the
japanese
island
of
botel
tobago
which
is
only
sixty
miles
north
of
our
most
northern
possession
no
missionaries
or
other
persons
had
been
allowed
by
the
natives
to
land
on
their
shores
until
a
few
japanese
police
arrived
in
they
are
mentioned
in
passing
because
they
are
a
example
of
what
the
people
in
the
northern
islands
of
the
philippine
group
were
before
the
coming
of
the
white
men
and
the
friars
their
dwellings
are
very
peculiar
each
family
has
a
court
surrounded
by
a
low
wall
of
stone
within
this
enclosure
they
have
three
houses
one
with
its
sides
sunk
down
into
the
ground
in
order
to
give
protection
from
high
winds
one
with
ordinary
walls
for
use
during
normal
weather
and
a
third
built
on
poles
about
ten
feet
above
the
ground
for
use
during
the
hot
season
from
these
elevated
houses
a
constant
watch
is
maintained
for
schools
of
fish
the
people
are
expert
fishermen
and
make
excellent
nets
and
they
have
beautiful
boats
with
high
bows
and
sterns
in
dampier
day
the
people
were
friendly
and
hospitable
as
they
are
at
the
present
time
they
valued
iron
more
than
gold
and
gladly
exchanged
it
for
iron
the
ancient
diggings
are
still
to
be
seen
but
the
pay
dirt
is
of
such
a
low
grade
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
work
it
the
precious
metal
is
washed
out
by
the
natives
in
cocoanut
shells
which
take
the
place

gold
pan
many
gold
ornaments
of
attractive
design
are
still
to
be
found
in
these
islands
some
of
those
taken
from
graves
remind
one
strongly
of
chaldean
work
the
graves
of
the
ancient
inhabitants
were
placed
high
upon
the
mountains
some
near
the
smoking
craters
of
the
volcanoes
others
on
the
crests
of
the
hills
it
is
supposed
that
the
graves
near
the
smoking
craters
were
those
of
persons
who
had
a
bad
reputation
in
the
community
while
those
on
the
tops
of
the
ridges
contained
the
bodies
of
the
good
and
that
by
this
method
of
burial
the
ideas
of
heaven
and
hell
were
carried
out
in
a
practical
manner
the
bodies
were
placed
in
or
earthenware
jars
some
of
which
had
a
high
glaze
and
were
profusely
ornamented
the
corpse
was
inserted
into
the
jar
in
a
sitting
position
and
the
orifice
was
sealed
by
placing
an
inverted
olla
over
the
mouth
of
the
first
these
jars
were
then
placed
on
end
and
a
small
pyramid
of
stones
built
around
them
on
the
top
of
which
a
little
tree
was
planted
a
number
of
these
graves
ranged
around
the
edge
of
a
smoking
sulphur
crater
are
an
uncanny
sight
which
the
natives
take
good
care
to
avoid
the
women
of
the
batan
islands
when
walking
or
working
out
of
doors
wear
a
distinctive
headdress
consisting
of
a
long
grass
hood
which
stretches
from
the
forehead
to
below
the
hips
it
protects
the
head
and
back
from
the
sun
wind
and
rain
so
that
it
is
worn
at
all
times
and
in
all
seasons
it
is
one
of
the
most
original
and
useful
of
all
primitive
garments
during
the
dry
season
but
little
rain
falls
in
these
islands
and
as
there
are
few
streams
or
springs
every
means
is
employed
to
catch
the
least
drop
even
the
trees
in
the
yards
have
pieces
of
rattan
twisted
around
their
trunks
and
larger
branches
to
make
the
water
drop
off
into
earthen
jars

from
the
north
men
are
stationed
on
the
thatched
roofs
of
the
high
dwellings
to
seize
the
birds
by
the
feet
as
soon
as
they
alight
great
numbers
are
caught
in
this
manner
every
year
and
form
quite
an
element
of
the
food
supply
many
of
the
islands
are
excellent
places
for
the
production
of
cattle
itbayat
island
unique
because
its
shores
are
higher
than
the
interior
has
many
thousand
head
of
excellent
cattle
the
coast
is
so
precipitous
that
when
they
are
exported
they
have
to
be
lowered
to
the
water
edge
by
means
of
a
block
and
tackle
as
at
tangier
they
then
have
to
swim
out
to
the
waiting
ship
where
they
are
hoisted
by
their
horns
to
the
deck
another
of
the
cattle
islands
is
called
dalupiri
this
beautiful
spot
was
given
in
its
entirety
to
aldecoa
and
company
of
manila
by
the
spanish
government
in
fact
when
the
united
states
first
took
possession
of
the
philippines
this
company
claimed
sovereignty
over
the
island
but
this
of
course
was
not
recognized
by
the
united
states
government
the
cattle
that
are
pastured
here
are
a
cross
between
the
black
spanish
bulls
of
fighting
lineage
and
the
humped
cattle
of
india
great
care
is
taken
that
the
stock
be
well
kept
up
and
for
this
purpose
there
is
a
constant
weeding
out
of
undesirables
the
method
in
which
this
is
done
is
both
interesting
and
very
exciting
the
cattle
roam
at
will
and
are
very
wild
and
hard
to
approach
as
a
result
they
have
to
be
hunted
with
great
care
about
twenty
men
are
employed
in
their
capture
all
of
whom
are
mounted
on
hardy
little
horses
four
of
them
are
lassoers
and
the
rest
huntsmen
the
lassos
are
nooses
attached
to
the
ends
of
bamboo
poles
about
twelve
feet
long
the
rope
from
the
noose
to
the
length
of
about
feet
is
coiled
around
the
bamboo
pole
and
tied
to
it
four
feet
from
the
lower
end
when
the
lasso
is
thrown
over
an
animal
head
the
pole
is
dropped
by
the
rider
the
rope
unwinds
and
drags
the
pole
along
the
ground
until
it
catches
on
a
rock
or
a
bush
and
stops
the
mad
career
of
the
animal
we
started
out
early
one
morning
major
mitchell
writes
me
to
cut
several
young
bulls
out
of
a
herd
of
about
five
hundred
cattle
led
by
the
manager
of
the
island
we
galloped
over
the
rough
surface
of
the
hilltops
and
through
deep
waving
grass
until
one
of
the
huntsmen
signaled
that
the
herd
was
in
sight
a
careful
inspection
was
made
of
the
herd
with
a
telescope
and
the
animals
for
capture
were
selected
and
carefully
pointed
out
to
the
lassoers
who
immediately
took
up
their
posts
in
concealment
beside
a
little
plain
the
huntsmen
then
proceeded
under
cover
to
points
around
the
herd
which
would
enable
them
to
drive
the
cattle
on
to
the
little
plain
where
the
lassoers
could
get
in
their
work
after
a
wait
of
about
a
half
hour
the
horn
of
the
chief
huntsman
pealed
forth
and
was
answered
by
the
yells
of
his
companions
the
herd
unable
to
go
in
another
direction
dashed
for
the
little
plain
followed
by
its
pursuers
crouching
behind
some
low
bushes
the
lassoers
waited
until
the
cattle
now
in
full
stampede
had
come
within
fifty
yards
when
in
a
twinkling
they
dashed
into
the
midst
of
the
galloping
herd
after
a
terrific
race
one
lasso
held
true
on
a
fine
young
bull
while
the
rest
scampered
off
into
the
ravines
and
water
courses
the
dragging
bamboo
pole
soon
brought
him
to
a
stop
and
after
several
charges
at
his
captors
two
more
lassos
were
placed
on
him
and
he
was
securely
fastened
and
dragged
to
a
tree
against
which
his
head
was
tied
a
little
saw
was
produced
from
somewhere
and
his
gallant
horns
were
cut
off
short
an
old
sedate
carabao
who
seemed
to
be
perfectly
at
home
made
his
appearance
the
young
bull
was
tied
to
the
carabao
harness
and
towed
off
toward
the
corral
at
first
he
tried
frantically
to
gore
the
carabao
but
as
his
horns
had
been
removed
no
harm
resulted
the
carabao
did
not
mind
it
in
the
least
but
continued
tranquilly
on
his
way
three
more
bulls
were
captured
on
that
day
each
furnished
exceedingly
fast
and
interesting
sport
i
have
seen
mounted
work
of
a
great
many
kinds
such
as
pig
sticking
stag
hunting
and
hunting
of
many
kinds
of
game
including
our
own
fox
hunting
and
polo
but
never
have
i
seen
any
mounted
work
which
required
more
dash
nerve
good
judgment
and
endurance
than
that
displayed
by
these
herdsmen
of
the
northern
islands
although
these
islands
are
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
balintan
channel
through
which
some
of
the
shipping
passes
from
america
to
the
southern
part
of
china
they
are
seldom
visited
this
is
because
as
i
have
said
before
there
are
no
ports
not
even
good
anchorages
during
the
typhoon
season
they
are
exposed
to
the
full
force
of
these
great
hurricanes
while
the
waters
are
infested
with
hidden
rocks
and
coral
ledges
the
cruiser
ran
aground
on
a
coral
reef
east
of
the
island
of
camaguin
in
and
sank
immediately
during
the
war
the
fleet
of
the
russian
admiral
rojesvenski
passed
on
either
side
of
batan
island
the
japanese
had
observers
on
the
summit
of
mt
iraya
on
this
island
who
are
supposed
to
have
signaled
by
heliograph
to
mt
morrison
in
formosa
of
the
coming
of
the
fleet
the
great
armada
could
be
seen
from
this
mountain
for
more
than
one
hundred
miles
chapter
vii
among
the
when
the
americans
first
came
to
the
philippines
most
of
the
mountain
country
could
be
reached
only
on
foot
over
dangerous
trails
very
large
tracts
were
unexplored
and
the
tribes
who
are
found
nowhere
but
in
this
northern
part
of
luzon
pillaged
the
neighbouring
towns
a
state
of
order
has
now
been
established
except
in
parts
of
kalinga
and
apayao
the
mountain
province
the
home
of
the
includes
the
of
benguet
lepanto
amburayan
bontoc
ifugao
kalinga
and
apayao
the
officers
of
the
provinces
are
a
governor
a
a
supervisor
in
charge
of
the
road
and
trail
work
and
the
construction
of
public
buildings
and
seven
lieutenant
governors
all
these
officers
are
appointed
by
the
governor
general
they
live
on
horseback
undergo
great
hardships
and
also
take
great
risks
the
manners
and
customs
of
these
tribes
differ
somewhat
each
one
for
instance
has
a
different
mode
of
treating
the
captured
head
when
it
is
brought
in
but
all
celebrate
a
successful
hunt
with
a
cañao
or
festival
the
ifugaos
place
the
head
upon
a
stake
and
hold
weird
ceremonial
dances
around
it
followed
by
speech
making
and
the
drinking
of
as
they
call
their
wine
afterward
the
skull
of
the
victim
is
utilized
as
a
household
ornament
venison
and
chicken
are
served
at
such
feasts
and
the
large
bats
which
are
considered
delicacies
if
one
of
the
tribe
has
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
his
head
taken
they
berate
the
spirit
at
the
funeral
asking
him
why
he
had
been
careless
enough
to
get
himself
killed
the
most
picturesque
of
the
tribes
that
my
husband
saw
were
the
kalingas
who
are
different
from
all
other
natives
of
luzon
it
is
said
that
the
spaniards
took
fifteen
hundred
moros
into
this
part
of
the
country
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
so
they
may
have
founded
this
tribe
at
all
events
the
kalingas
are
superbly
developed
tall
and
slight
some
of
the
men
having
handsome
and
almost
classical
features
neither
the
men
nor
the
women
cut
the
hair
which
in
the
case
of
the
men
is
banged
in
front
and
tied
up
with
rags
behind
some
wearing
nets
to
keep
it
out
of
their
eyes
although
the
women
have
abundant
hair
they
use
switches
into
which
they
stick
beautiful
feathers
the
men
also
decorate
themselves
in
the
same
way
on
the
back
of
the
head
they
often
wear
little
caps
woven
of
beautifully
stained
rattan
and
covered
with
agate
beads
and
these
are
used
as
pockets
in
which
small
articles
are
carried
great
holes
are
pierced
in
the
lobes
of
their
ears
into
which
are
thrust
wooden
ear
plugs
with
tufts
of
red
and
yellow
worsted
almost
every
kalinga
woman
wears
a
pair
of
heavy
brass
ear
ornaments
and
sometimes
a
solid
piece
of
cut
like
a
figure
eight
the
kalingas
are
particularly
warlike
their
very
name
meaning
enemy
or
stranger
and
endeavours
to
bring
them
under
government
control
were
begun
only
a
few
years
ago
there
are
still
some
which
the
lieutenant
governor
has
not
yet
visited
as
it
seemed
best
to
wait
and
bring
the
people
to
terms
by
peaceful
means
while
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
at
baguio
the
secretary
of
war
governor
forbes
secretary
worcester
general
edwards
and
my
husband
started
north
into
the
mountains
to
see
some
of
the
strange
tribes
that
were
gathering
from
far
and
wide
to
meet
the
great
or
chief
as
they
called
secretary
dickinson
i
give
the
account
of
the
trip
in
my
husband
own
words
on
saturday
night
july
after
the
assembly
baile
we
motored
to
the
docks
and
went
aboard
the
transport
for
the
trip
northward
we
were
made
very
comfortable
on
this
big
transport
with
deck
cabins
but
we
all
slept
on
the
open
deck
by
preference
and
had
a
pleasant
run
till
in
the
morning
we
were
entering
subig
bay
a
splendid
vast
harbour
between
great
mountains
the
narrow
entrance
guarded
by
isola
grande
here
we
landed
and
visited
the
batteries
and
although
it
was
a
small
island
it
was
a
stewing
hot
walk
about
it
especially
as
the
secretary
sets
a
great
pace
till
a
torrential
shower
came
up
and
drove
us
to
the
commanding
officer
house
where
we
had
a
bite
of
breakfast
and
all
the
breakfasts
at
the
posts
which
we
have
visited
have
been
so
good
general
duvall
had
come
up
from
manila
on
his
yacht
and
on
board
of
her
we
crossed
the
bay
to
olongapo
where
there
is
the
present
naval
station
the
great
hulk
of
the
famous
floating
dock
was
looming
up
there
just
floated
again
after
her
mysterious
sinking
which
even
now
they
do
not
seem
to
be
able
to
explain
the
guard
was
out
with
the
band
and
the
honours
were
paid
and
the
marines
paraded
but
soon
another
severe
tropical
storm
broke
and
drove
some
of
us
back
to
the
ship
while
the
others
went
on
to
another
breakfast
at
the
officers
club
this
storm
suggested
a
typhoon
but
there
had
been
no
warning
from
the
jesuit
observatory
at
manila
and
so
we
rejoined
the
out
by
isola
grande
and
went
to
sea
without
fear
this
is
the
rainy
and
typhoon
season
but
the
warnings
of
severe
storms
are
so
carefully
given
that
they
have
lost
their
terrors
and
this
year
so
far
there
has
been
a
disturbance
much
to
our
comfort
as
it
has
permitted
the
carrying
out
of
all
our
plans
it
is
a
most
unusual
thing
for
such
good
weather
to
continue
the
hot
season
is
over
and
this
is
called
the
intermediate
but
it
is
the
time
of
rains
on
this
coast
the
seasons
differing
slightly
on
the
different
coasts
and
in
the
different
islands
so
all
that
night
we
cruised
up
the
coast
through
showers
of
rain
and
lightning
passing
by
bolinao
light
which
we
had
first
sighted
as
we
approached
the
philippines
before
daylight
we
stopped
off
tagudin
and
through
the
darkness
could
be
seen
the
dim
shadow
of
land
and
mountains
and
a
light
burning
on
the
beach
as
a
beacon
with
dawn
we
saw
a
wonderful
tropical
shore
develop
before
us
of
low
land
fringed
with
palm
surrounded
by
beautiful
mountain
ranges
a
tiny
village
on
the
beach
and
a
crowd
of
people
gathered
together
soon
a
put
out
and
brought
aboard
the
governors
of
the
nearby
provinces
early
and
gallman
brave
ready
men
who
have
taken
these
wild
people
in
hand
and
become
among
them
and
after
a
bite
of
breakfast
we
were
all
taken
ashore
through
the
surf
very
handily
and
the
secretary
was
welcomed
by
a
native
band
and
the
chief
men
of
the
neighbourhood
and
crowds
of
half
naked
natives
the
ilocanos
of
the
northwest
coast
of
luzon
are
a
fine
kindly
race
but
there
had
also
come
down
from
the
interior
a
lot
of
small
brown
men
to
pack
in
our
baggage
bontoc
igorots
and
of
whom
we
were
to
see
more
in
their
own
country
these
little
fellows
at
first
seemed
like
dwarfs
but
soon
after
as
we
saw
them
better
they
proved
small
but
well
formed
and
well
nourished
strong
gentle
little
people
they
ran
forward
and
seized
our
packages
and
disappeared
down
the
trail
in
a
wild
willing
manner
off
they
trotted
while
we
were
packed
into
carromatos
dragged
by
weedy
diminutive
native
horses
which
are
wonderfully
powerful
for
their
size
we
went
after
greeting
the
people
off
down
the
trail
through
the
outskirts
of
tagudin
we
did
go
into
the
town
which
was
somewhat
to
one
side
as
there
had
been
some
cholera
there
with
its
nipa
houses
of
plaited
grass
perched
up
above
the
ground
many
decorated
in
honour
of
the
occasion
we
rattled
along
an
excellent
road
for
we
have
certainly
done
wonders
in
here
past
paddy
fields
where
the
slow
carabao
grazed
with
little
children
perched
on
their
backs
past
troops
of
natives
with
their
loads
standing
alongside
governor
general
forbes
had
made
the
most
wonderful
preparations
for
the
trip
it
was
the
first
time
that
any
american
officials
only
insular
officials
previously
had
gone
in
to
these
wild
people
and
of
course
the
secretary
is
the
highest
in
rank
that
can
visit
the
islands
since
he
is
the
one
through
whom
the
president
governs
the
philippines
and
the
president
can
never
come
the
trip
was
unique
and
all
the
arrangements
were
extraordinary
for
a
new
trail
had
been
planned
into
the
mountains
but
was
not
due
to
be
done
for
eight
months
and
yet
thousands
of
these
wild
men
had
been
called
in
and
helped
to
finish
the
road
so
much
the
more
quickly
for
we
were
the
first
party
to
pass
over
it
and
some
of
the
bridges
had
only
been
finished
the
night
before
we
passed
eagerly
and
willingly
when
they
were
told
that
the
great
apo
was
coming
in
to
visit
them
forbes
had
sent
to
hongkong
for
some
and
had
had
men
trained
to
pull
and
push
them
but
these
had
not
stood
the
test
well
and
we
did
have
the
need
or
the
chance
to
use
them
he
also
had
had
palanquin
chairs
brought
over
from
china
and
men
taught
in
a
way
to
carry
them
and
these
we
did
use
on
some
of
the
steep
descents
but
we
rode
horses
excellent
ones
from
forbes
own
stable
almost
all
the
way
every
three
kilometers
companies
of
igorots
and
ifugaos
were
stationed
to
act
as
and
rush
along
the
baggage
by
relays
and
this
they
did
with
shouts
and
cheers
as
quickly
as
we
traveled
tiffin
and
breakfasts
had
been
prepared
all
along
the
way
every
eventuality
had
been
anticipated
and
it
was
really
too
well
done
for
it
made
our
traveling
seem
so
easy
that
we
had
to
think
hard
to
realize
into
what
places
we
were
going
a
few
days
before
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
work
our
way
over
the
perpendicular
old
trails
with
difficulty
finding
bearers
for
our
packs
and
we
would
have
been
compelled
to
carry
our
own
food
a
severe
trip
and
a
hard
undertaking
we
went
in
absolutely
unarmed
and
without
escort
and
yet
nearly
every
native
that
we
saw
after
we
reached
the
hills
carried
his
spear
and
head
ax
but
there
was
a
suggestion
of
danger
people
were
brought
together
on
this
occasion
from
different
tribes
who
two
years
ago
would
have
killed
each
other
at
sight
and
yet
were
dancing
with
each
other
we
were
accompanied
by
the
governors
of
the
as
we
passed
through
them
and
an
unarmed
orderly
and
sergeant
doyle
who
had
charge
of
governor
forbes
horses
and
generally
by
a
shouting
horde
of
natives
the
secretary
proved
a
wonder
well
mounted
as
he
was
he
led
on
at
a
great
pace
till
it
seemed
a
sort
of
endurance
test
i
was
more
than
pleased
to
find
that
i
stood
it
as
i
did
for
we
traveled
four
days
out
of
the
five
for
forty
miles
a
day
and
rode
most
of
it
i
came
out
finally
in
much
better
form
than
when
i
went
in
and
so
from
the
beach
where
we
landed
the
carromatos
carried
us
across
the
low
coast
plain
over
new
bridges
on
which
the
inscriptions
stated
that
they
had
been
finished
for
the
passage
of
the
secretary
and
his
party
and
under
triumphal
arches
made
of
bamboo
which
welcomed
him
all
the
natives
whom
we
passed
saluted
and
many
wished
to
shake
hands
or
only
touch
the
hand
as
we
passed
till
we
came
into
the
foothills
and
over
them
into
a
little
village
of
nipa
huts
among
the
bamboo
and
tropical
trees
where
we
found
our
horses
waiting
here
we
mounted
and
started
off
at
a
good
pace
over
the
well
built
road
that
trailed
around
cliff
and
crag
as
we
worked
into
the
mountains
a
procession
a
cavalcade
winding
in
and
out
we
traveled
along
the
valley
of
a
river
that
later
became
a
gorge
with
steep
cliffs
and
precipitous
sides
all
the
natives
were
out
to
greet
the
secretary
and
finally
we
came
to
a
tiny
village
where
we
had
a
drink
of
refreshing
cocoanut
water
all
the
people
standing
about
or
hanging
out
of
the
windows
of
the
simple
houses
which
looked
very
clean
and
neat
we
trailed
on
along
the
narrow
road
cut
into
the
rock
in
many
places
really
a
remarkable
road
and
up
the
gorge
with
the
rushing
river
below
us
the
mountains
rose
high
and
opened
up
in
lovely
velvety
greens
and
shaded
away
into
the
blues
of
distance
we
stopped
at
a
little
native
rest
house
above
a
ford
in
the
river
where
we
found
a
luncheon
prepared
for
us
but
it
was
a
hurried
luncheon
and
on
we
went
climbing
a
winding
trail
that
zigzagged
up
the
steep
mountainside
through
tropical
tangle
of
bamboo
and
fern
and
great
overhanging
trees
with
trailing
parasites
the
ghost
tree
the
hard
woods
and
some
with
a
beautiful
mauve
flower
at
the
top
that
even
worcester
could
tell
me
the
name
of
he
said
he
had
been
so
busy
inventing
names
for
the
birds
that
he
had
had
time
yet
to
find
names
for
trees
and
below
the
views
opened
up
wider
and
more
splendid
and
range
on
range
of
mountains
rose
above
each
other
while
the
precipices
grew
deeper
and
more
terrifying
and
suddenly
as
we
came
to
a
turn
in
the
trail
there
appeared
above
us
a
most
picturesque
sight
against
the
skyline
some
ifugao
warriors
lithe
beautifully
formed
men
whose
small
size
was
lost
in
their
symmetry
with
spears
in
their
hands
turbans
of
blue
wrapped
about
their
heads
and
loin
cloths
of
blue
with
touches
of
red
and
yellow
in
their
streaming
ends
that
hung
like
an
apron
before
and
like
a
tail
behind
their
handsome
brown
bodies
like
mahogany
they
had
belts
made
of
round
shells
from
which
hung
their
bolos
these
were
the
head
men
of
a
company
of
ifugaos
who
had
come
this
far
to
greet
the
party
and
they
stood
so
gracefully
on
the
point
above
us
and
around
the
turn
we
found
the
rest
of
the
band
stunning
looking
fellows
standing
at
attention
in
line
behind
their
lances
which
were
stuck
in
a
row
in
the
ground
here
we
had
another
tiffin
while
these
warriors
seized
and
scampered
off
with
our
luggage
from
this
time
on
as
we
traveled
we
found
reliefs
of
these
picturesque
people
waiting
their
turn
at
carrying
and
then
all
would
join
in
the
procession
and
shouting
a
cheer
like
american
collegians
their
war
cry
they
would
rush
on
and
frighten
us
to
death
with
the
risk
of
going
over
the
steep
places
away
off
in
the
distance
reëchoing
through
the
valleys
we
could
hear
the
cheers
and
cries
very
musical
of
others
of
our
party
as
they
traveled
along
soon
we
began
to
be
greeted
by
the
of
natives
who
had
come
out
to
honour
the
secretary
and
by
their
singing
as
we
approached
and
then
they
would
dance
round
in
a
strange
way
as
we
passed
on
the
ifugaos
had
come
to
meet
the
secretary
from
several
days
journey
away
mostly
through
bontoc
igorot
country
all
armed
and
yet
there
had
been
a
sign
of
trouble
and
these
ifugaos
who
two
years
ago
were
wild
have
been
brought
into
wonderful
control
by
their
governor
gallman
there
are
some
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
of
these
picturesque
people
among
whom
is
now
nearly
stamped
out
though
there
are
sporadic
cases
doubtless
these
little
savages
too
appear
most
gentle
and
tractable
most
willing
and
laughing
in
the
rough
tumbling
of
the
trail
and
they
have
proved
very
clever
for
they
were
the
builders
of
the
roads
over
which
we
traveled
we
were
told
that
they
could
drill
rock
better
than
americans
on
a
few
months
practice
and
that
they
have
sat
for
a
few
days
and
watched
japanese
bricklayers
set
brick
and
then
done
it
as
well
as
the
japanese
but
indeed
their
their
paddy
fields
their
terracing
which
they
have
practised
for
hundreds
of
years
is
the
most
wonderful
in
the
world
and
there
is
nothing
even
in
japan
to
compare
with
their
work
of
this
kind
their
great
game
of
has
taught
them
cleverness
and
they
are
full
of
snap
and
go
the
ifugao
is
a
great
talker
and
has
all
the
gestures
of
an
orator
when
he
begins
a
speech
he
first
gives
a
long
call
to
attract
attention
then
climbs
a
stand
fifteen
feet
high
by
means
of
a
ladder
he
generally
begins
his
remarks
by
stating
that
he
is
a
very
rich
man
and
goes
on
to
praise
himself
and
his
tribe
and
at
the
end
of
his
harangue
he
often
himself
leads
off
in
the
applause
by
loudly
clapping
his
hands
he
has
become
a
fine
rifleman
and
is
a
fearless
fighter
in
clout
coat
and
cap
and
a
belt
of
ammunition
with
legs
bare
he
travels
incredible
distances
and
makes
a
good
constabulary
soldier
the
governor
general
is
anxious
to
form
them
into
a
militia
but
they
lose
their
grip
we
were
told
when
they
are
taken
down
from
the
hills
to
the
plain
illustration
constabulary
soldiers
and
so
we
went
on
up
to
over
four
thousand
feet
to
where
the
pass
broke
through
the
mountain
and
there
before
us
was
a
vast
valley
with
a
splendid
plain
beyond
and
in
the
middle
of
it
on
a
prominence
we
could
see
cervantes
where
we
were
to
stop
our
first
night
it
seemed
so
near
and
yet
proved
many
miles
away
as
we
traced
our
way
down
the
steep
coasts
of
the
valley
and
the
view
of
the
plain
below
widened
and
the
ranges
of
mountains
beyond
rose
into
finer
heights
we
twisted
and
trailed
zigzag
down
the
slopes
for
the
change
of
vegetation
due
to
the
mountain
range
which
divided
a
different
climate
on
either
side
of
it
in
passing
over
the
ridge
had
been
remarkable
and
though
we
had
seen
rare
orchids
and
begonias
as
we
mounted
we
descended
from
the
same
height
through
pine
and
pasture
when
finally
we
reached
the
plateau
and
had
crossed
a
river
bed
we
were
met
by
the
people
of
the
village
of
cervantes
many
girls
in
gay
dress
riding
astride
on
their
midget
ponies
and
men
and
boys
on
their
rugged
little
mounts
these
escorted
the
party
under
the
triumphal
arches
into
the
grass
streets
of
the
pretty
village
where
the
simple
public
buildings
were
decorated
and
the
local
band
played
till
we
finally
were
taken
to
the
houses
where
we
were
to
spend
the
night
the
secretary
and
the
governor
and
clark
and
myself
going
to
the
lieutenant
governor
he
was
married
to
a
filipina
wife
and
here
i
must
say
that
we
met
several
of
these
filipina
wives
of
white
men
and
they
had
most
perfect
manners
and
self
possession
and
real
grace
and
this
one
was
a
good
cook
the
house
was
a
best
class
native
house
and
more
comfortable
than
we
had
anticipated
though
there
were
sounds
and
smells
that
rather
disturbed
us
there
was
a
reception
and
baile
at
the
municipal
building
in
the
evening
where
we
had
to
go
and
dance
a
rigodon
each
partnered
off
with
some
dainty
little
filipina
lady
and
then
we
did
hurry
home
to
rest
for
we
had
been
up
since
half
after
four
that
morning
and
were
to
start
next
morning
a
little
after
five
the
next
day
trail
was
very
fine
for
we
started
off
over
a
river
which
we
crossed
on
a
flying
bridge
a
swinging
car
on
a
cable
while
the
horses
were
forded
and
then
we
had
splendid
but
slow
climbing
up
the
gorge
of
one
river
after
another
coasting
the
mountainside
where
we
could
see
the
mark
of
the
trail
many
miles
ahead
above
us
and
part
of
our
procession
trailing
along
in
single
file
or
rushing
along
with
distant
shout
as
the
little
willing
native
cargadores
carried
their
loads
up
and
up
above
us
rose
mount
data
with
its
mysterious
waterfall
that
seems
to
come
right
out
of
its
peak
and
clouds
circled
about
us
and
below
the
valleys
streaked
away
into
the
distance
and
the
ranges
rose
higher
and
higher
and
the
play
of
light
and
shadow
was
beautiful
on
the
greens
and
grays
and
browns
and
blues
of
the
distances
we
began
to
see
rancherias
the
native
villages
perched
up
on
the
hills
the
thatched
roofs
like
haystacks
with
blue
smoke
at
times
coming
through
and
paddy
fields
began
to
climb
the
upper
valleys
in
their
terraces
with
the
pale
green
rice
and
fringes
of
the
banana
palm
of
which
the
hemp
is
made
in
places
the
red
croton
was
planted
on
the
terraces
for
luck
and
in
the
ravines
which
we
crossed
there
were
cascading
falls
and
pools
we
rose
higher
and
higher
over
another
range
and
at
the
of
the
trail
another
group
of
igorots
were
dancing
and
playing
their
as
we
passed
and
rushed
alongside
to
touch
fingers
soon
we
passed
through
a
village
built
in
a
stony
gorge
where
a
river
ran
down
the
houses
consisted
of
conical
thatched
roofs
supported
on
four
wooden
piers
with
ladders
leading
up
into
the
roofs
where
the
people
lived
the
foundations
were
terraced
in
stone
and
the
paths
were
and
it
all
looked
very
neat
and
clean
on
our
way
back
we
stopped
for
tiffin
at
this
same
village
and
had
the
women
come
and
show
us
how
they
weave
for
it
was
a
place
famed
for
its
weaving
this
time
our
tiffin
was
farther
on
at
a
with
a
splendid
view
and
it
had
been
laid
out
so
prettily
with
temporary
flower
beds
and
bamboo
arches
the
belgian
priest
from
a
town
nearby
had
come
to
join
us
at
luncheon
and
although
he
spoke
no
english
i
had
a
pleasant
time
with
him
in
french
for
he
proved
to
be
a
sort
of
relative
of
our
cousins
the
de
buisserets
his
name
was
padre
sepulchre
one
of
a
band
of
belgians
belonging
to
no
order
but
educated
highly
for
missionary
priesthood
who
have
been
sent
out
since
our
occupation
by
the
pope
and
many
of
whom
are
rich
and
gentlemen
born
this
one
had
already
in
two
years
spent
some
twenty
thousand
dollars
gold
of
his
own
money
in
his
town
another
such
missionary
we
met
at
bontoc
and
several
at
other
places
and
all
are
said
to
do
good
work
illustration
rice
terraces
we
started
off
after
tiffin
on
the
long
trail
that
wound
down
the
gorge
of
el
chico
de
cagayan
river
on
our
way
to
bontoc
villages
became
more
numerous
and
were
very
picturesque
on
the
spurs
of
mountain
above
the
river
or
embowered
in
coffee
trees
where
the
mountain
coasts
were
patched
with
pineapple
plantations
and
the
paddy
fields
grew
in
terrace
after
terrace
most
splendid
engineering
by
these
primitive
people
rising
above
each
other
up
into
the
clouds
fitting
into
the
contours
of
the
mountainsides
the
terrace
walls
overgrown
with
green
and
the
pale
green
paddy
within
and
little
cascades
carrying
the
water
down
from
terrace
to
terrace
most
lovely
like
some
great
hanging
gardens
little
brown
people
were
stooping
at
work
in
them
all
naked
but
with
their
clothes
covered
by
leaves
and
balanced
on
their
heads
to
be
kept
dry
for
there
were
showers
and
cloud
effects
that
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
panorama
as
we
passed
the
terraces
add
beauty
and
interest
to
the
eye
by
their
succession
of
levels
and
as
we
traveled
into
the
country
they
became
more
frequent
and
complete
curiously
enough
the
bontoc
igorots
have
forest
laws
and
a
forest
service
of
their
own
the
mountainsides
of
their
rough
country
are
sparsely
timbered
with
pine
which
has
grown
very
scarce
near
some
of
the
larger
settlements
forests
in
the
vicinity
of
such
settlements
are
divided
up
into
small
private
holdings
claimed
by
individuals
whose
right
thereto
is
recognized
by
the
other
members
of
the
tribe
in
many
places
it
is
forbidden
to
cut
trees
until
they
have
reached
a
large
size
although
the
lower
branches
are
constantly
trimmed
off
and
used
for
firewood
forest
fires
are
kept
down
to
facilitate
reforestation
and
young
trees
are
planted
such
foresight
on
the
part
of
a
primitive
people
is
certainly
unusual
so
we
trailed
all
day
till
toward
half
after
five
we
turned
a
point
and
came
to
bontoc
after
a
procession
of
natives
had
come
streaming
out
some
miles
up
the
gorge
to
meet
the
party
bontoc
is
the
capital
of
the
mountain
province
and
was
the
goal
of
our
journey
the
native
town
is
very
dirty
and
is
acknowledged
to
be
one
of
the
worst
of
the
native
villages
in
the
more
savage
places
the
towns
are
said
to
be
cleaner
we
walked
through
it
where
the
terraced
stone
walks
pass
by
stone
pits
where
the
pigs
wallow
and
by
thatched
houses
which
have
no
exit
for
the
smoke
and
so
are
filthy
and
in
dreadful
condition
we
saw
the
communal
shacks
in
which
the
unmarried
and
widowed
members
live
with
their
peculiar
rights
and
the
sties
where
the
old
men
resort
to
talk
and
we
stood
outside
the
wretched
place
where
the
skulls
are
kept
and
some
heads
all
black
and
smoked
were
brought
out
in
a
basket
from
the
secret
recesses
for
us
to
see
illustration
ifugao
couple
some
of
these
bontoc
igorots
are
skilful
smiths
and
they
make
excellent
earthen
pots
and
clay
pipes
they
have
interesting
athletic
sports
of
their
own
and
take
to
those
of
the
americans
they
are
especially
fond
of
beads
which
are
wound
in
their
hair
or
hung
about
the
neck
and
greatly
value
large
white
stones
caring
little
for
agates
so
highly
prized
by
the
kalingas
into
bontoc
for
this
great
occasion
had
been
brought
warriors
and
women
from
the
kalingas
and
ifugaos
with
igorots
from
about
some
from
a
distance
of
several
days
travel
and
for
the
first
time
these
warring
tribes
who
only
two
years
before
were
taking
each
other
heads
came
peacefully
together
and
watched
each
other
with
as
much
interest
as
they
watched
us
the
adventures
of
the
american
lieutenant
governors
read
like
romances
and
here
they
were
before
us
with
their
following
the
kalingas
more
dangerous
and
warlike
than
the
ifugaos
and
the
ifugaos
more
picturesque
and
interesting
than
the
igorots
and
all
together
making
a
scene
there
were
too
several
small
companies
of
native
constabulary
for
these
hill
men
make
splendid
soldiers
and
take
great
pride
in
their
arms
and
uniform
and
have
proved
loyal
to
the
death
all
the
different
tribes
and
the
constabulary
had
turned
out
to
receive
the
secretary
and
it
was
a
vociferous
and
noisy
yelling
crowd
that
streamed
about
in
irregular
procession
we
were
some
of
us
taken
to
a
government
house
that
was
comfortable
and
took
our
meals
at
a
club
which
the
officials
have
built
and
which
is
quite
pathetically
complete
and
that
evening
we
did
little
before
turning
in
the
first
evening
since
we
had
landed
in
the
islands
when
we
were
able
to
turn
in
at
a
reasonable
hour
with
the
prospect
of
sleeping
as
late
as
we
pleased
next
day
next
day
was
a
day
of
festivities
a
cañao
for
from
morning
till
night
there
was
dancing
by
these
fantastic
peoples
whom
so
few
white
men
have
ever
seen
we
were
waked
early
enough
alas
by
the
the
and
there
were
parades
of
the
different
tribes
through
the
town
a
small
grandstand
had
been
erected
in
the
plaza
and
there
we
stood
with
the
secretary
and
the
few
white
teachers
and
the
missionaries
from
about
while
the
procession
was
reviewed
the
constabulary
came
first
dressed
only
in
loin
cloths
of
different
colours
below
the
waist
but
with
the
regulation
khaki
uniform
blouse
and
cap
above
they
are
officered
by
americans
and
a
few
natives
and
are
most
military
notwithstanding
the
strange
appearance
of
their
bare
legs
some
companies
were
very
well
drilled
and
they
gave
exhibitions
of
different
manuals
as
well
as
any
regular
white
soldiers
might
have
done
the
wild
kalingas
came
past
next
most
picturesque
with
their
feather
headdresses
of
red
and
yellow
and
spears
and
head
axes
and
their
brightly
coloured
loin
cloths
and
the
women
in
scant
but
gay
garments
and
not
at
all
ashamed
in
their
nakedness
and
these
gave
their
characteristic
dances
with
outstretched
arms
hopping
and
prancing
about
in
a
circle
all
the
time
looking
down
into
the
center
of
the
circle
about
which
they
dance
where
the
head
of
the
decapitated
is
supposed
to
be
there
were
innumerable
which
they
play
with
variations
so
as
to
make
much
rhythm
and
movement
and
the
women
joined
in
the
dancing
more
moderately
some
with
big
cigars
in
their
mouths
and
looking
extremely
indifferent
then
when
they
danced
in
a
circle
some
would
prance
into
the
center
with
shield
and
ax
and
pretend
attacks
upon
each
other
and
leap
about
and
grow
excited
and
this
sort
of
thing
they
kept
up
all
day
and
part
of
the
night
too
off
and
on
illustration
ifugao
head
dance
the
ifugaos
followed
and
passed
by
and
gave
their
dances
which
are
the
same
with
a
difference
but
each
was
ended
with
a
mighty
shout
after
which
one
of
the
head
men
would
step
forward
and
deliver
a
rattling
speech
and
they
greeted
the
secretary
variously
but
cordially
for
they
like
our
american
rule
indeed
they
have
never
had
any
other
for
the
spaniards
never
attempted
to
come
in
and
control
them
then
the
bontoc
igorots
followed
and
gave
exhibitions
with
noisy
demonstrations
and
two
or
chiefs
who
six
months
before
were
trying
to
kill
each
other
danced
and
pranced
together
while
the
beat
and
others
hopped
and
circled
round
most
of
the
men
were
tattooed
each
tribe
in
its
own
peculiar
manner
certain
marks
indicating
that
their
bearer
had
killed
his
man
and
taken
a
head
some
bore
marks
of
many
heads
one
man
dancing
was
known
to
have
taken
seventeen
many
of
the
women
too
were
tattooed
with
a
pattern
and
so
the
dances
went
on
in
some
the
participants
postured
fighting
and
then
represented
wounded
men
in
others
all
were
head
men
together
some
were
rapid
in
motion
some
slow
but
all
had
real
grace
that
grace
of
the
wild
man
and
all
were
finely
formed
and
and
healthy
looking
when
the
dancing
was
over
the
groups
of
savages
in
their
fantastic
dress
squatting
around
the
plaza
behind
their
spears
stuck
in
the
ground
with
bolo
and
and
and
the
women
standing
about
made
a
wonderful
scene
after
the
dances
and
speeches
the
head
men
came
up
to
the
secretary
and
handed
him
weapons
as
gifts
sometimes
their
own
with
which
they
had
often
fought
dickinson
of
course
received
the
chiefs
and
the
head
men
and
women
afterward
and
presented
them
with
shells
and
blankets
and
plumes
in
return
the
bartering
among
them
was
rather
amusing
as
they
tried
to
exchange
what
they
had
received
and
did
want
illustration
weapons
of
the
wild
tribes
at
the
club
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
they
gave
us
a
remarkable
dinner
all
the
americans
in
the
district
were
present
and
the
few
filipinos
entertained
us
at
a
baile
and
so
our
day
was
finished
we
started
out
at
daylight
next
morning
and
hiked
back
by
the
same
trail
but
the
views
seemed
finer
in
their
repetition
than
even
when
we
first
passed
through
them
we
had
had
most
superb
weather
although
it
was
the
rainy
season
and
had
enjoyed
the
grand
panoramas
to
the
full
but
the
last
afternoon
it
came
on
to
pour
down
in
torrents
which
we
enjoyed
too
as
an
experience
for
we
came
safely
to
tagudin
where
the
people
and
the
band
joined
in
sending
us
off
as
they
had
received
us
and
we
were
safely
taken
out
through
quite
a
heavy
surf
and
put
on
board
the
coast
guard
boat
and
had
a
glass
with
ice
in
it
again
chapter
viii
inspecting
with
the
secretary
of
war
august
thirteenth
is
a
holiday
in
the
philippine
islands
for
it
is
occupation
day
the
anniversary
of
the
fall
of
manila
and
its
occupation
by
the
american
army
the
special
event
is
a
camp
fire
in
the
evening
at
the
theater
when
the
philippine
war
veterans
gather
together
and
have
addresses
and
refreshments
after
a
dinner
with
tom
anderson
at
the
army
and
navy
club
with
its
picturesque
quarters
in
an
old
palace
intramuros
we
attended
this
performance
sitting
in
the
governor
box
and
listening
to
the
happy
of
the
veterans
who
all
wore
the
blue
shirt
and
khaki
of
war
times
it
was
toward
midnight
when
we
finally
left
and
went
out
to
our
vessel
for
we
were
off
for
a
trip
among
the
southern
islands
on
the
cable
steamer
we
sailed
by
the
light
of
a
full
moon
and
for
a
while
had
a
merry
bobbery
of
it
outside
after
passing
corregidor
soon
though
we
turned
a
point
and
had
the
monsoon
following
in
the
morning
we
woke
to
find
ourselves
steaming
past
the
fine
scenery
of
southern
luzon
with
the
volcano
of
taal
in
the
distance
several
times
during
the
spanish
occupation
this
volcano
dealt
death
and
destruction
and
as
late
as
it
claimed
many
victims
our
first
landing
place
was
at
kotta
on
luzon
where
we
started
ashore
in
a
small
launch
it
was
a
beautiful
river
of
palms
but
our
boat
got
stuck
in
the
mud
and
we
were
delayed
we
finally
reached
the
shore
and
were
put
into
automobiles
then
it
was
that
i
began
to
feel
as
if
i
had
joined
a
circus
parade
escorted
by
bands
and
soldiers
our
motors
moved
slowly
along
the
streets
everywhere
people
lined
the
way
while
the
windows
of
the
houses
fairly
dripped
with
heads
we
passed
many
little
villages
that
looked
prosperous
and
processions
of
carts
showing
that
the
people
were
active
and
busy
the
road
ran
over
picturesque
bridges
for
part
of
it
was
an
old
spanish
trail
rejuvenated
at
all
the
villages
they
had
made
preparations
to
receive
the
secretary
bands
were
out
the
children
stood
by
the
roadside
and
waved
and
the
women
stood
in
rows
to
greet
us
the
municipal
buildings
were
decorated
the
piazzas
hung
with
festoons
and
lanterns
they
all
wanted
to
give
us
and
let
off
speeches
but
it
was
impossible
to
live
through
such
hospitalities
so
we
only
halted
at
each
place
a
few
minutes
to
shake
hands
the
stop
for
the
night
was
lucena
the
home
of
quezon
philippine
commissioner
to
the
united
states
congress
he
traveled
with
us
and
we
found
him
very
attractive
the
general
opinion
was
that
quezon
legarda
and
osmeña
were
playing
to
the
gallery
for
political
capital
but
at
the
same
time
they
were
supporting
our
administration
it
is
a
good
deal
like
some
of
our
friends
in
congress
who
make
speeches
along
lines
that
they
know
are
absolutely
untenable
after
climbing
into
a
bandstand
where
we
stood
surrounded
by
people
peering
up
at
us
flowery
speeches
began
demanding
independence
they
were
the
first
of
the
kind
we
had
heard
the
filipinos
are
good
speakers
and
keen
politicians
among
other
remarks
an
orator
said
many
things
occur
to
my
mind
each
of
which
is
important
but
among
them
there
is
one
which
constitutes
a
fundamental
question
for
the
filipinos
and
the
americans
it
is
a
question
that
interests
equally
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
it
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
our
people
and
it
is
a
question
also
of
justice
for
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
fundamental
question
is
evidently
gentlemen
the
question
of
a
political
finality
of
my
country
we
are
very
grateful
for
your
visit
secretary
and
we
hope
that
the
joy
that
we
felt
on
your
arrival
may
not
be
clouded
that
it
may
not
be
tempered
but
rather
that
it
shall
be
heightened
by
seeing
in
you
a
true
interpretation
of
the
desires
of
the
philippine
people
hoping
that
on
your
return
to
the
united
states
after
your
visit
to
the
philippine
islands
you
will
tell
the
truth
as
regards
the
aspirations
of
the
philippine
people
in
answering
the
secretary
talked
about
the
different
subjects
of
interest
such
as
the
agricultural
bank
land
titles
etc
he
continued
it
is
very
gratifying
to
me
coming
from
america
and
representing
the
government
in
the
position
in
which
i
stand
to
hear
such
testimonials
as
you
have
given
in
regard
to
the
men
that
america
has
sent
to
assist
you
in
advancing
your
interests
america
has
been
careful
to
send
men
in
whom
confidence
can
be
reposed
according
to
their
previous
character
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
further
that
america
has
given
you
here
just
as
good
government
as
she
has
given
to
her
people
at
home
in
all
established
governments
fair
and
just
criticism
is
welcome
and
i
shall
not
therefore
bear
any
spirit
that
would
be
resentful
of
any
just
criticism
i
shall
be
very
glad
while
i
am
here
to
meet
those
who
have
the
real
welfare
of
the
islands
at
heart
and
the
development
of
this
country
i
have
many
things
to
do
and
the
time
is
comparatively
short
but
i
shall
endeavour
so
to
conduct
affairs
as
to
be
able
to
give
audience
to
all
people
who
may
desire
to
make
any
representations
to
me
i
shall
be
at
convenient
periods
here
where
i
shall
be
accessible
and
any
communications
which
are
addressed
to
me
personally
will
receive
proper
consideration
now
that
states
in
a
general
way
the
object
of
my
visit
and
the
disposition
that
i
propose
to
make
of
my
time
while
here
general
edwards
who
is
with
me
as
you
know
is
the
chief
of
the
insular
bureau
certainly
he
more
than
any
other
man
in
america
understands
conditions
in
the
philippines
and
his
whole
time
thought
and
mind
are
concentrated
upon
the
problems
connected
with
your
welfare
and
he
is
working
all
the
time
to
advance
your
interests
his
familiarity
with
conditions
from
the
time
of
america
occupation
the
establishment
of
civil
government
the
settling
of
the
various
commercial
questions
that
have
arisen
from
time
to
time
make
him
the
most
effective
champion
for
the
philippine
interests
in
america
and
he
has
not
hesitated
in
congress
whenever
your
interests
are
at
stake
to
stand
up
and
contend
for
your
interests
with
vehemence
that
ought
to
make
him
eligible
to
all
option
as
a
philippine
citizen
you
have
there
a
brilliant
representative
quezon
who
is
capable
of
presenting
your
views
and
aspirations
and
of
enforcing
your
wishes
with
the
most
cogent
arguments
of
which
your
cause
is
susceptible
now
as
to
immediate
independence
we
americans
understand
by
immediate
right
away
do
you
want
us
to
get
up
and
leave
you
now
to
depart
from
your
country
you
would
find
yourselves
surrounded
by
graver
problems
than
have
hitherto
confronted
you
if
we
should
do
so
i
positively
assert
but
i
suggest
that
you
yourselves
pause
and
think
whether
you
might
not
be
reaching
forth
and
grasping
a
fruit
which
like
the
dead
sea
fruit
would
turn
to
ashes
upon
your
lips
it
was
at
lucena
that
my
husband
and
i
went
to
captain
and
house
for
the
night
we
sat
on
the
piazza
by
moonlight
among
beautiful
orchids
listening
to
the
band
playing
in
the
distance
and
gossiping
i
was
interested
in
the
servant
problem
and
had
much
to
tell
me
that
was
new
our
native
servants
would
much
rather
have
a
pleasant
you
than
a
tip
she
said
if
a
tip
is
offered
the
chances
are
that
it
will
be
refused
for
the
boys
feel
that
they
would
do
wrong
to
accept
it
they
are
very
keen
though
about
their
presents
at
christmas
every
native
who
has
done
a
hand
turn
for
me
during
the
year
will
turn
up
christmas
day
to
wish
me
a
and
i
am
expected
to
give
him
a
present
my
whole
day
is
for
my
servants
and
their
children
who
seem
to
multiply
at
that
time
when
i
asked
my
how
many
have
you
he
answered
señora
how
many
under
fourteen
lucio
señora
he
wanted
all
the
presents
that
he
could
get
she
laughed
but
if
they
do
take
tips
do
they
get
good
wages
i
asked
not
according
to
american
ideas
a
filipino
boy
will
work
for
small
pay
and
stay
a
long
time
in
a
cheerful
home
atmosphere
they
are
good
servants
too
she
continued
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
train
them
i
trained
a
green
boy
to
be
a
good
cook
by
taking
an
american
cook
book
and
translating
it
into
spanish
they
have
a
great
reverence
for
books
and
that
boy
thought
he
was
very
scientific
i
had
him
many
years
we
loaned
him
money
to
build
his
hut
near
us
he
was
a
year
paying
it
off
but
he
paid
off
every
cent
now
he
has
four
children
for
christmas
gifts
when
i
went
away
on
a
visit
he
asked
me
to
bring
him
a
gold
watch
from
america
so
many
years
with
us
gave
him
that
privilege
as
we
were
gone
some
time
i
think
he
feared
we
might
not
return
so
he
wrote
us
a
letter

my
interest

letter

pedro
on
returning
from
the
united
states
i
took
pedro
back
went
on
but
i
found
i
needed
extra
house
boys
the
first
who
presented
himself
was
antonio
aged
seventeen
he
was
a
very
serious
boy
whose
only
other
service
had
been
a
year
on
an
merchant
ship
i
took
him
at
once
for
servants
from
boats
are
usually
well
trained
he
turned
out
well
and
in
a
few
months
asked
if
he
could
send
for
his
little
brother
to
be
second
boy
to
help
him
i
said
he
could
so
in
due
time
crispin
smilingly
presented
himself
no
questions
passed
as
to
salary
or
work
he
was
installed
on
any
terms
that
suited
me
a
few
weeks
later
antonio
asked
if
he
could
bring
his
cousin
in
just
to
learn
the
work
so
that
he
could
find
a
place
i
consented
and
in
time
came
sacarius
gentle
and
and
apparently
intent
on
learning
and
always
handy
and
useful
again
a
favour
was
asked
this
time
that
the
father
of
antonio
might
come
as
a
visitor
for
a
three
weeks
stay
he
was
very
old
would
not
eat
in
my
house
only
sleep
in
the
servants
room
so
again
i
consented
father
must
have
already
been
on
his
way
permission
taken
for
granted
for
his
arrival
was
almost
simultaneous
i
found
him
sitting
in
my
kitchen
in
very
new
and
very
clean
white
clothes
the
saintliest
old
tao
with
no
teeth
white
hair
and
a
perpetual
smile
he
rose
and
bowed
low
to
me
but
he
speak
spanish
or
english
so
called
his
son
to
him
to
salute
me
for
him
formally
i
returned
it
and
made
him
welcome
to
my
house
he
bade
them
tell
me
he
had
journeyed
far
to
tell
me
of
his
gratitude
for
my
goodness
to
his
family
and
that
he
had
such
in
me
that
he
had
instructed
his
sons
never
to
leave
me
the
old
fellow
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
and
spent
so
much
of
his
son
money
that
antonio
shipped
him
home
in
a
week
are
they
spoiled
by
living
with
americans
yes
but
it
shows
most
in
their
clothes
antonio
dresses
almost
as
well
as
his
master
laughed
but
he
does
not
attempt
to
work
in
his
best
clothes
wearing
the
regulation
costume
without
objection
even
though
some
of
the
army
officers
muchachos
are
allowed
to
dress
like
fashion
plates
and
clatter
round
the
polished
floors
in
their
russet
shoes
a
muchacho
will
spend
his
whole
month
pay
for
a
single
pair
of
american
russet
shoes
they
love
russet
and
the
shoe
stores
flourish
in
consequence
how
about
their
amusements
i
inquired
whenever
they
can
get
off
they
go
to
baseball
games
and
the
movies
the
little
girls
wear
store
dresses
now
and
great
bunches
of
ribbon
in
their
hair
white
shoes
and
silk
stockings
some
families
who
in
the
early
days
had
hardly
a
rag
on
their
backs
now
own
motors
i
do
believe
you
could
force
independence
on
them
the
señoritas
trip
home
from
normal
school
with
their
american
pumps
and
paint
enough
on
their
faces
to
qualify
for
broadway
the
poor
children
have
to
swelter
in
knitted
socks
knitted
hoods
and
knitted
sweaters
just
because
they
come
from
america
filipino
children
are
wonderful
though
they
never
cry
unless
they
are
ill
they
are
allowed
absurd
liberty
but
they
do
seem
to
get
spoiled
the
filipina
women
love
white
children
intensely
the
fair
skins
seem
to
charm
them
and
they
really
ca
resist
kissing
a
blond
child
we
certainly
enjoyed
our
stay
at
lucena
house
was
so
clean
and
homelike
with
its
pretty
dining
room
and
its
broad
veranda
and
the
big
shower
bath
which
felt
so
refreshing
we
went
to
sleep
that
night
watching
the
palm
leaves
waving
in
the
moonlight
in
the
early
morning
we
all
got
into
automobiles
again
and
ran
over
fine
roads
built
since
the
american
occupation
we
left
the
china
sea
and
crossed
the
island
to
the
pacific
climbing
a
wonderful
tropical
mountain
where
by
the
way
we
nearly
backed
off
a
precipice
because
our
brakes
refused
to
work
and
we
frightened
a
horse
as
we
whizzed
on
to
antimonan
the
churches
here
had
towers
something
like
chinese
pagodas
and
the
big
lamps
inside
were
covered
with
mexican
silver
all
these
island
towns
have
a
presidente
and
a
board
of
governors
called
and
each
province
has
a
governor
manila
hemp
is
one
of
the
principal
products
of
this
prosperous
province
and
it
is
chiefly
used
to
make
rope
the
plant
from
which
this
hemp
is
made
looks
very
much
like
a
banana
plant
the
stalk
is
stripped
and
only
the
tough
fibers
are
used
they
employ
the
cocoanut
a
good
deal
to
make
oil
which
is
obtained
from
the
dried
meat
called
copra
they
had
a
procession
of
their
products
here
at
antimonan
which
was
very
interesting
the
hemp
and
cigar
importations
were
first
carried
on
by
salem
captains
in
the
fifties
the
great
american
shipping
firm
in
those
days
was
russell
sturgis
oliphant
and
company
the
philippines
were
out
of
the
line
of
travel
however
and
few
people
went
there
except
for
trade
in
fact
as
far
as
i
know
only
one
book
was
written
by
an
american
about
the
islands
before
the
american
occupation
on
the
next
morning
when
i
looked
out
of
my
porthole
at
dawn
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
were
gazing
at
an
exquisite
turner
painting
mount
mayon
was
standing
there
majestically
superb
in
its
cloak
of
silver
mist
which
changed
to
fiery
red
it
is
the
most
beautiful
mountain
in
the
world
more
perfect
in
outline
than
fuji
dickinson
was
so
inspired
by
its
beauty
that
she
wrote
a
poem
a
stanza
of
which
i
give
mount
mayon
in
lonely
grandeur
rises
from
a
sea
of
flame
type
of
bold
aggressive
manhood
lifting
high
a
famous
name
the
conflict
of
endeavour
ranging
round
its
earthly
base
where
heartache
and
failure
ever
stand
face
to
face
illustration
landing
at
tobaco
our
landing
at
tobaco
was
made
in
the
most
novel
way
as
the
water
was
shallow
and
the
could
not
get
into
the
dock
three
carabaos
hitched
to
a
wagon
waded
out
till
only
their
noses
could
be
seen
we
stepped
on
to
the
cart
and
sat
in
state
on
chairs
while
we
through
the
water
to
the
shore
there
we
went
to
the
town
hall
and
had
a
banquet
with
many
brown
men
and
a
few
little
brown
women
the
governor
of
the
province
spoke
and
general
bandholtz
responded
in
spanish
for
the
secretary
who
had
gone
ahead
to
close
a
government
coal
mine
that
was
not
proving
successful
after
the
banquet
we
had
an
enchanting
automobile
ride
through
quaint
villages
at
the
foot
of
the
great
mountain
to
albay
where
a
review
of
the
scouts
was
held
by
the
secretary
in
the
setting
sun
when
our
party
dispersed
for
dinner
and
i
were
farmed
out
to
the
superintendent
of
schools
calkins
the
houses
built
for
americans
were
all
of
wood
with
broad
piazzas
much
like
summer
cottages
at
home
with
the
hall
in
which
we
dined
in
the
center
and
the
bedrooms
leading
off
it
so
much
has
been
written
about
the
schools
and
the
wonders
in
education
in
the
philippines
that
i
shall
not
try
to
enlarge
on
this
interesting
theme
other
than
to
add
my
tribute
to
the
government
and
the
teachers
and
also
to
the
people
who
are
wise
enough
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
offered
each
little
juan
and
maria
with
their
desire
to
learn
may
soon
put
to
shame
little
john
and
mary
if
the
latter
are
not
careful
it
has
not
been
a
fad
with
them
as
we
feared
it
would
be
one
of
the
teachers
told
me
they
have
stuck
to
it
many
in
the
family
make
real
sacrifices
to
keep
their
juniors
in
school
my
little
filipina
dressmaker
is
educating
all
her
sister
children
and
sending
her
brother
to
the
law
school
at
first
too
we
feared
there
would
only
be
a
desire
to
learn
english
and
the
higher
branches
but
with
a
very
little
urging
they
are
learning
domestic
science
and
the
trades
showing
that
they
have
a
mind
for
practical
matters
after
all
i
begged
her
to
tell
me
more
about
the
natives
since
she
understood
the
people
so
well
and
what
she
said
is
worth
repeating
even
in
his
grief
the
filipino
is
a
cheerful
creature
she
began
curiously
enough
too
a
death
in
the
family
is
an
occasion
for
general
and
prolonged
festivities
an
orchestra
is
hired
for
as
many
days
as
the
wealth
of
the
family
permits
and
a
banquet
is
spread
continuously
at
which
all
are
welcome
even
former
enemies
of
the
deceased
strangers
from
the
street
can
come
i
often
wondered
if
the
beggars
imposed
on
this
custom
but
there
are
very
few
of
them
and
they
seem
to
respect
it
the
music
drones
on
day
after
day
sometimes
only
one
instrument
will
be
left
the
other
players
going
out
to
smoke
or
eat
or
rest
but
they
reassemble
from
time
to
time
and
keep
it
going
there
is
always
much
dancing
for
the
natives
are
great
dancers
and
were
not
the
last
to
learn
the
and
hesitation
even
in
their
slippers
they
are
very
graceful
of
course
masses
are
said
for
they
firmly
believe
that
these
will
take
their
departed
to
heaven
with
this
belief
they
are
so
happy
knowing
the
dear
one
is
better
off
in
heaven
than
here
that
chopin
funeral
march
is
quickly
turned
into
waltz
time
and
the
waxes
merry
in
spanish
times
each
district
had
its
band
which
always
played
at
the
church
festivals
each
church
had
its
patron
saint
and
there
was
always
a
saint
day
fiesta
going
on
in
some
district
in
the
churchyard
booths
were
spread
as
at
our
country
fairs
everything
from
toys
to
all
kinds
of
chance
games
of
which
they
are
so
fond
was
sold
the
band
played
continuously
and
the
people
came
in
crowds
the
americans
have
catered
to
this
spirit
in
the
yearly
carnival
which
is
given
every
february
this
carnival
is
more
than
a
fiesta
though
for
it
is
also
an
exhibition
of
their
produce
and
handiwork
their
hats
have
always
been
famous
as
has
their
needlework
and
under
american
encouragement
the
exhibit
has
become
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
some
hemp
baskets
woven
in
colours
look
as
if
they
were
made
of
lustrous
silk
i
ca
say
which
i
like
best
the
finest
of
our
alaskan
indian
or
apache
or
filipino
baskets
their
shell
work
is
lovely
too
and
their
buttons
are
coming
into
the
world
market
for
the
first
time
the
filipinos
are
also
learning
at
the
school
of
arts
and
trades
to
carve
their
magnificent
woods
most
skilfully
and
are
making
furniture
which
will
soon
be
coming
to
the
states
in
the
early
days
a
few
chinamen
had
the
monopoly
of
furniture
carving
and
making
they
copied
the
very
ornate
pieces
brought
to
manila
by
the
spaniards
from
spain
and
france
in
the
native
mahogany
called
nara
and
in
a
harder
and
very
beautiful
wood
called
or
in
a
still
harder
one
known
as
a
native
ebony
american
women
soon
began
to
search
the
stores
and
pawn
shops
for
the
originals
and
had
them
polished
and
restored
at
bilibid
prison
the
expense
considering
was
small
a
dining
table
of
solid
mahogany
is
often
nearly
eight
feet
in
diameter
and
two
or
three
inches
thick
another
of
the
teachers
told
me
something
of
her
experiences
in
the
early
days
when
she
went
out
with
her
father
who
was
one
of
the
first
american
army
officers
there
when
we
landed
we
lived
in
an
old
spanish
palace
she
said
which
of
course
we
proceeded
to
clean
that
was
the
first
thing
all
americans
did
on
landing
we
took
eleven
army
loads
from
the
palace
of
every
kind
of
dirt
conceivable
then
we
began
washing
windows
and
mirrors
and
lamps
which
i
am
sure
had
never
been
touched
with
water
before
the
servants
were
so
amazed
that
they
were
of
very
little
use
they
were
mostly
chinese
and
had
never
seen
white
women
work
before
the
sight
of
such
energy
staggered
them
just
when
we
got
things
running
smoothly
father
was
called
home
and
our
cleaned
house
fell
to
his
wife
who
wept
and
said
she
had
never
been
put
in
such
a
dirty
place
it
was
after
this
that
my
real
adventures
began
father
mckimmon
was
opening
public
schools
and
wanted
english
taught
so
he
went
among
the
army
girls
and
just
begged
us
to
give
up
a
few
of
our
good
times
and
do
some
of
this
work
i
did
see
how
i
could
teach
people
when
i
know
their
language
but
he
explained
how
simple
it
would
be
and
we
could
learn
spanish
at
the
same
time
it
was
fun
to
work
with
the
spanish
nuns
they
were
so
interested
in
us
and
their
quaint
methods
with
the
children
amused
me
constantly
arms
were
always
folded
when
they
rose
to
recite
and
it
was
always
de
usted
at
your
service
before
they
could
sit
down
the
nuns
soon
became
pupils
of
ours
too
when
the
spanish
prisoners
liberated
by
our
men
from
the
filipinos
were
brought
to
manila
they
were
quartered
in
our
school
for
a
hospital
i
never
saw
such
starved
wrecks
many
of
them
young
men
had
no
teeth
left
more
americans
were
arriving
on
every
transport
and
a
most
delightful
society
was
forming
of
army
and
navy
people
government
officials
and
naval
officers
of
every
nation
in
addition
to
the
original
spanish
population
and
the
small
colonies
of
many
countries
there
were
parties
of
all
kinds
and
as
we
trained
our
cooks
into
our
own
ways
we
ventured
on
dinner
parties
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
dinner
i
went
to
that
was
cooked
in
spanish
style
there
was
every
kind
of
wine
i
ever
heard
of
but
no
water
i
wanted
some
but
it
was
not
to
be
had
my
host
apologized
for
not
having
provided
any
but
no
one
dared
drink
the
city
supply
we
sat
down
to
table
at
nine
and
rose
at
twelve
and
when
the
men
joined
us
at
one
they
were
all
much
amazed
that
i
made
the
move
to
go
home
i
left
manila
to
visit
my
brother
in
the
provinces
traveling
in
those
days
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
now
after
leaving
the
railroad
there
were
no
motors
to
go
up
the
mountain
instead
of
that
i
rode
an
ancient
american
horse
till
i
was
tired
and
burning
with
the
sun
then
my
brother
put
me
in
a
bull
cart
and
i
sat
on
the
floor
of
that
till
the
sun
was
preferable
to
the
bumping
i
arrived
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
was
put
down
in
an
empty
room
with
my
trunk
and
a
packing
box
being
a
good
army
girl
that
packing
box
had
all
the
elements
of
comfort
but
first
there
was
cleaning
to
be
done
my
brother
was
the
commanding
officer
in
that
town
his
house
being
at
the
corner
of
the
plaza
and
an
outpost
so
he
sent
me
a
police
party
that
is
ten
native
prisoners
and
an
american
sentry
they
were
armed
with
brooms
and
buckets
i
said
this
room
is
very
dirty
the
captain
sent
these
men
here
to
clean
it
for
me
mam
said
the
sentry
i
told
him
want
the
ceiling
cleaned
first
even
the
corners
he
turned
to
his
gentle
prisoners
with
you
shinny
up
that
pole
and
those
corners
he
did
know
much
spanish
but
limpia
means
clean
and
is
the
one
essential
word
i
soon
unpacked
my
box
and
turned
it
into
an
dressing
table
after
out
of
it
had
come
all
that
made
the
room
livable
that
night
i
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
very
tired
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
shout
a
gun
was
thrown
to
the
floor
and
a
man
voice
yelled
for
help
i
simply
froze
i
could
move
hand
or
foot
the
voice
was
in
the
outpost
guard
room
just
under
my
own
of
course
i
was
sure
the
whole
guard
was
overpowered
and
being
boloed
i
waited
for
them
to
come
to
me
as
i
lay
there
then
i
heard
a
voice
call
from
an
upstairs
window
the
matter
down
there
and
the
answer
four
had
a
nightmare
sir
thought
there
was
a
goat
on
his
bunk
just
as
i
was
going
to
sleep
again
i
threw
out
my
hand
in
my
restlessness
and
to
my
horror
clasped
it
round
a
cold
shiny
every
large
house
has
one
in
the
garret
to
keep
down
the
rats
this
time
i
gave
the
scream
and
sprang
out
of
bed
but
no
snake
was
to
be
found
and
i
decided
it
must
have
been
the
bed
post
but
what
a
night
that
was
we
reëmbarked
at
legaspi
and
sailed
on
to
the
island
of
samar
which
is
in
the
typhoon
belt
catbalogan
is
a
town
which
has
been
visited
by
very
severe
typhoons
and
terrible
plagues
but
by
very
few
people
it
is
a
small
place
far
away
and
forgotten
but
the
island
of
samar
is
where
the
massacre
of
the
ninth
infantry
occurred
the
massacre
at
balangiga
by
the
natives
in
there
were
triumphal
arches
of
bamboo
and
flowers
and
speeches
in
the
town
hall
governor
forbes
speaking
in
both
english
and
spanish
afterward
eight
small
boys
and
girls
dressed
in
red
white
and
blue
danced
for
us
enchantingly
the
charcca
and
the
jota
clicking
their
little
heels
and
snapping
their
little
fingers
in
true
spanish
style
delicious
sweetmeats
were
offered
on
the
veranda
real
native
dishes
and
we
drank
cocoanut
milk
and
ate
cocoanut
candy
preserves
nuts
and
cakes
two
girls
who
spoke
english
took
very
good
care
of
us
as
we
left
we
looked
out
over
the
sea
to
the
setting
sun
and
watched
a
lonely
fisherman
standing
on
a
rock
throwing
his
net
next
morning
from
the
we
saw
across
a
stretch
of
calm
water
the
blue
ranges
of
the
mountains
of
bohol
native
bancas
glided
silently
about
and
a
boat
drifted
idly
round
the
point
where
the
picturesque
gray
walls
of
the
oldest
spanish
fort
in
the
philippines
stood
guard
its
sentinel
houses
at
the
corners
were
all
moss
grown
and
pretty
pink
flowers
were
breaking
out
of
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
we
landed
at
cebu
which
is
the
oldest
town
in
the
islands
and
passed
down
a
street
lined
with
ancient
houses
whose
second
stories
arcaded
the
sidewalk
they
were
all
in
good
condition
in
spite
of
their
age
for
they
were
built
of
the
wonderful
hard
woods
that
last
forever
in
fact
cebu
has
the
look
of
a
new
and
prosperous
place
for
there
have
been
fires
which
burnt
up
many
of
the
ramshackle
houses
and
gave
a
chance
to
widen
the
streets
and
replace
the
old
structures
with
permanent
looking
buildings
the
american
government
has
done
wonders
in
deepening
the
harbour
and
building
a
sea
wall
behind
which
concrete
warehouses
are
going
up
there
was
a
scramble
to
a
review
near
the
barracks
then
another
scramble
to
a
reception
at
the
house
of
the
colonel
commanding
a
very
nice
but
hot
occasion
and
then
still
another
scramble
to
the
dedication
of
a
really
excellent
schoolhouse
a
young
priest
took
us
to
see
the
famous
idol
the
small
black
infant
christ
we
went
to
the
convent
of
the
dominicans
near
the
church
and
passed
through
its
pretty
unkempt
court
up
a
staircase
with
treads
and
handrail
richly
carved
in
a
wood
which
was
hard
as
iron
and
black
with
age
it
was
handsome
work
such
as
we
had
been
looking
for
and
seen
before
in
the
sacristy
too
and
the
robing
room
there
were
screens
and
paneling
with
richly
detailed
carvings
passing
down
the
galleries
of
the
convent
where
we
could
see
some
of
the
friars
at
work
we
entered
the
special
chapel
where
this
holy
image
is
kept
several
doors
were
taken
off
a
rather
gaudily
gilded
altar
until
at
last
the
little
figure
was
revealed
its
back
was
toward
the
room
and
it
had
to
be
carefully
turned
a
small
brown
wooden
doll
all
dressed
in
cloth
of
gold
and
bejeweled
like
the
bambino
of
rome
it
is
considered
a
most
sacred
and
wonderful
idol
as
we
had
heard
speeches
by
filipinos
and
head
hunters
i
was
curious
to
know
what
the
chinese
would
have
to
say
and
that
night
there
was
an
opportunity
to
find
out
for
we
were
invited
to
a
dinner
given
by
the
chinese
merchants
i
quote
from
the
speech
made
by
alfonso
zarata
sy
cip
which
was
specially
interesting
the
chinese
have
traded
with
these
islands
since
long
before
confucius
and
mencius
said
sy
cip
and
for
centuries
we
have
been
coming
here
and
assimilating
with
the
filipinos
and
we
are
deeply
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
country
the
chinese
have
been
called
a
nation
of
traders
the
jews
of
the
east
but
we
are
more
than
traders
we
are
labourers
artisans
farmers
manufacturers
and
producers
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
growth
and
development
of
the
commerce
and
material
interests
of
the
islands
is
due
to
the
efforts
of
our
countrymen
the
infusion
of
chinese
blood
has
strengthened
and
improved
the
filipino
people
chinese
labour
is
recognized
all
over
the
world
as
the
best
cheap
labour
in
existence
since
american
occupation
of
these
islands
you
have
excluded
our
labour
from
entering
why
not
for
the
reason
that
it
would
tend
to
lower
the
standard
of
living
among
filipino
labourers
because
the
standard
of
living
among
chinese
labourers
in
the
philippines
is
higher
than
among
the
filipino
labourers
hence
the
introduction
of
chinese
labourers
would
tend
rather
to
improve
conditions
in
this
regard
you
do
not
exclude
him
for
the
reason
that
he
works
for
lower
wages
than
the
labourers
of
the
country
because
on
the
contrary
the
chinese
labourer
in
the
philippines
receives
higher
wages
than
the
native
labourer
hence
the
introduction
of
chinese
labourers
would
tend
rather
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
native
labourers
as
far
as
wages
are
concerned
you
do
not
exclude
him
for
the
reason
that
he
will
not
become
assimilated
with
the
natives
of
the
country
because
centuries
of
experience
have
shown
that
filipinos
and
chinese
do
assimilate
and
readily
amalgamate
and
the
result
as
i
have
already
said
is
an
improvement
of
the
filipino
people
if
you
are
excluding
chinese
labourers
from
the
philippines
because
of
political
reasons
then
i
confess
such
reasons
if
they
exist
have
been
carefully
guarded
as
secrets
from
the
public
lack
of
room
is
not
a
reason
for
excluding
chinese
labourers
nor
is
lack
of
need
for
their
services
in
the
great
island
of
mindanao
alone
it
is
doubtful
if
five
per
cent
of
the
tillable
land
is
under
cultivation
and
in
other
places
it
is
the
same
a
large
part
of
the
rice
consumed
in
these
islands
is
imported
from
other
countries
yet
we
have
here
the
finest
tropical
climate
in
the
world
and
the
most
productive
soil
let
a
sufficient
number
of
chinese
labourers
come
into
the
philippines
and
we
will
guarantee
that
in
ten
years
we
will
be
sending
rice
to
the
gates
of
pekin
and
tokyo
toward
night
we
sailed
on
the
from
cebu
for
the
land
of
the
moros
out
in
the
sulu

felt
very
near

in
the
afterglow
and
the
distant
islands
mauve
only
their
peaks
flaming
like
volcanoes
from

sun
then
the

stars
came
out

lanterns
and
left
a
trail
upon
the
dancing
waters
from
their
holes
below
the
cabin
boys
ah

would
pop
out

they
would

careful
later
when
the
moon
rose
out
of
the
sea
and
the
southern
cross
appeared
on
the
horizon
shadowy
forms
glided
silently
up
the
companionway
but
the
silence
did
not
last

he

disappear

chapter
ix
the
moros
on
reaching
mindanao
the
land
of
the
moros
we
went
ashore
at
camp
overton
where
we
were
met
by
army
officers
and
dougherties
drawn
by
teams
of
six
mules
after
a
at
the
commanding
officer
home
we
were
furnished
with
a
big
escort
of
cavalry
and
started
climbing
up
up
among
the
hills
soldiers
were
hidden
in
the
tall
grass
all
along
the
way
to
make
sure
that
nothing
would
happen
to
the
great
white
sultan
with
the
big
red
flag
as
the
moros
called
the
secretary
army
men
could
not
go
out
alone
even
in
those
days
for
they
were
attacked
by
bands
and
killed
principally
to
get
their
weapons
which
the
moros
were
very
keen
to
possess
the
the
head
men
of
the
moro
tribes
were
allowed
to
have
guns
but
none
of
the
other
natives
a
storm
came
up
however
not
long
ago
on
lake
lanao
at
camp
keithley
and
for
fear
that
his
boat
would
upset
general
wood
had
a
great
deal
of
ammunition
thrown
overboard
which
it
was
discovered
was
subsequently
fished
up
by
the
natives
the
moros
are
mohammedan
malays
they
came
in
their
boats
from
islands
further
south
and
in
were
converted
to
islam
by
an
arab
wise
man
makadum
who
made
his
way
to
sulu
and
mindanao
one
hears
then
of
raja
baginda
who
came
from
sumatra
in
his
daughter
married
abu
bahr
the
law
giver
who
established
the
mohammedan
church
and
after
his
death
became
sultan
and
founded
a
dynasty
in
the
old
days
the
moros
were
all
pirates
and
slave
traders
both
spanish
and
american
authorities
have
tried
to
suppress
slavery
but
it
still
exists
it
is
said
a
woman
will
bring
about
forty
pesos
a
dato
slaves
are
well
treated
and
form
part
of
the
family

slave
moreover
has
a
chance
to
rise
in
the
social
scale
for
piang
whom
we
met
was
once
a
slave
but
became
a
powerful
chief
and
a
friend
of
the
americans
the
ruler
of
all
the
moros
is
the
sultan
of
sulu
whom
we
did
not
see
because
he
was
in
europe
at
the
time
we
were
in
the
islands
it
is
said
that
a
few
years
ago
he
would
sometimes
appear
in
the
market
on
the
back
of
a
slave
with
an
umbrella
held
over
his
head
here
he
would
stay
while
the
people
kissed
his
hands
and
feet
he
may
have
changed
his
customs
since
his
trip
dampier
who
visited
the
northern
islands
of
the
philippines
has
also
left
us
notes
of
his
stay
on
mindanao
which
are
still
true
in
the
main
he
says
the
island
of
mindanao
is
divided
into
small
states
governed
by
hostile
sultans
the
governor
of
mindanao
being
the
most
powerful
the
city
of
mindanao
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
river
about
two
miles
from
the
sea
it
was
about
a
mile
in
length
and
winded
with
the
curve
of
the
river
the
houses
were
built
on
posts
from
fourteen
to
twenty
feet
high
and
in
the
rainy
season
looked
as
if
built
on
a
lake

natives

their
different
ways
in
canoes
the
houses
are
of
one
story
divided
into
several
rooms

by
a
ladder
or
stair
placed
outside
the
roofing
consists
of
palm
or
palmetto
leaves
the
floors
of
the
habitations
are
of
or
bamboo
a
singular
custom
but
which
facilitated
intercourse
with
the
natives
and
vice
versa
was
of
exchanging
names
and
forming
comradeship
with
a
native
whose
house
was
thenceforth
considered
the
home
of
the
stranger
alimund
din
name
stands
out
in
this
meager
moro
history
beyond
all
others
for
he
was
the
first
and
only
christian
ruler
in
this
land
even
before
he
became
a
christian
he
was
a
reformer
and
suppressed
piracy
he
not
only
coined
money
but
had
both
an
army
and
a
navy
and
lived
in
such
splendour
as
probably
has
not
existed
since
those
days
among
the
moros
alimund
din
ruled
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
time
of
philip
v
of
spain
in
return
for
ammunition
to
enable
the
spanish
to
keep
down
piracy
he
allowed
the
jesuit
fathers
to
enter
his
country
in
time
however
they
caused
trouble
among
the
moros
and
civil
war
broke
out
as
bautilan
a
relative
of
alimund
din
preferred
the
mohammedan
religion
to
the
new
ideas
of
the
jesuits
alimund
din
and
his
followers
took
flight
in
boats
and
in
time
reached
manila
where
they
interceded
for
spanish
protection
the
spaniards
showered
him
with
presents
gave
him
a
royal
entrance
into
the
city
and
finally
converted
him
to
christianity
later
he
was
sent
back
escorted
by
spanish
ships
but
bautilan
fleet
attacked
them
as
the
spaniards
suspected
alimund
din
of
becoming
a
christian
not
entirely
for
christianity
sake
they
threw
him
into
prison
the
throne
was
restored
to
him

who
occupied
this

of

a
moro
grave
the
moros
are
not
supposed
to
eat
meat
or
drink
wine
although
they
have
been
known
to
drink
whiskey
and
soda
with
americans
as
well
as
eat
pork
and
beans
on
occasions
there
are
no
mosques
in
this
region
or
holy
who
can
do
no
wrong
but
there
are
moro
priests
or
who
go
from
house
to
house
they
have
little
education
but
some
of
them
have
traveled
it
is
the
custom
for
a
relative
of
the
deceased
to
watch
and
protect
a
moro
grave
for
many
months
such
a
mourner
can
sometimes
be
seen
squatting
near
by
under
a
yellow
umbrella
the
moros
have
as
many
wives
as
they
can
afford
but
not
more
than
they
can
afford
for
it
is
an
insult
to
speak
of
a
man
wife
as
begging
bread
the
moros
are
smaller
than
the
east
indian
mohammedans
but
are
strong
and
slight

have
fine
features
they
appear
especially
cruel
and
determined
because
their
teeth
are
black
from
in
war
time
many
of
the
women
fought
beside
the
men
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
they
who
mutilated
the
americans
found
dead
on
the
field
after
battle
the
people
whom
we
met
on
the
road
with
their
ponies
loaded
with
hemp
seldom
smiled
and
did
not
bow
but
they
looked
us
straight
in
the
eye
and
there
was
no
touch
of
sulkiness
about
them
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
the
men
from
the
women
as
they
dress
much
alike
but
you
see
few
of
the
latter
on
the
road
for
being
mohammedans
most
of
them
are
kept
at
home
they
are
not
veiled
like
other
moslem
women
except
when
first
married
the
costumes
of
the
moros
differ
to
such
a
degree
and
for
no
reason
that
i
could
discover
that
it
is
difficult
to
describe
them
many
wear
tight
trousers
which
are
something
like
those
of
the
spaniards
so
tight
that
they
are
sewn
on
the
men
and
never
come
off
until
worn
out
and
are
often
bright
red
or
yellow
in
colour
on
the
other
hand
some
wear
very
loose
baggy
trousers
or
skirts
of
different
shades
indeed
they
are
the
most
gaily
dressed
people
i
have
ever
seen
and
their
brown
skins
set
off
the
vivid
yellows
and
greens
and
reds
and
magentas
and
purples
of
which
their
trousers
and
jackets
and
turbans
and
handkerchiefs
are
made
the
jackets
have
a
chinese
appearance
the
turbans
might
be
old
aunt
dinah
of
the
south
the
sashes
which
are
woven
in
the
moro
houses
are
of
silk
bright
green
and
dark
red
being
the
predominant
colours
they
are
knotted
on
one
side
generally
a
kriss
or
a
bolo
being
held
in
the
knot
and
are
tied
about
the
waist
so
tightly
that
the
men
look
almost
laced
and
perhaps
that
accounts
for
their
womanish
appearance
when
the
american
army
first
occupied
this
region
they
treated
the
moros
well
and
found
them
friendly
take
for
instance
zamboanga
in
the
south
an
especially
interesting
region
when
the
american
soldiers
entered
the
spanish
guard
left
the
garrison
and
the
spanish
population
and
the
priests
followed
the
americans
found
outside
the
town
gates
a
large
barbed
wire
bird
cage
where
the
moros
had
been
compelled
to
leave
their
arms
before
entering
the
town
at
night
to
avoid
an
uprising
the
government
of
zamboanga
at
this
time
was
reorganized
by
the
american
officers
a
filipino
presidente
was
appointed
a
dato
to
head
the
moros
and
a
captain
chinese
as
he
was
called
to
manage
his
people
who
were
mostly
merchants
and
pearl
fishers
mindanao
was
under
a
government
that
worked
wonders
for
in
a
few
years
many
of
the
moros
were
brought
under
control
and
they
became
loyal
americans
although
they
had
always
been
bitter
enemies
of
the
filipinos
and
the
spaniards
they
say
they
have
found
the
americans
brave
and
have
not
been
lied
to
by
them
and
so
they
seek
our
protection
although
the
moro
and
the
are
so
different
they
are
alike
in
one
respect
if
they
care
for
an
official
and
have
confidence
in
him
they
do
not
want
him
changed
it
is
the
man
they
are
willing
to
obey
rather
than
the
government
of
course
there
are
thousands
of
them
fierce
as
ever
back
in
the
mountains
and
they
are
still
fanatic
and
wild
even
among
those
who
are
under
control
the
greatest
care
has
to
be
exercised
for
they
have
the
hatred
of
the
christian
deep
in
their
hearts
and
they
may
run
amuck
at
any
moment
and
kill
till
they
are
killed
but
this
is
a
part
of
their
faith
they
ask
no
quarter
and
nothing
stops
them
but
death
besides
the
danger
of
their
attack
by
religious
mania
they
have
a
great
desire
for
rifles
as
i
have
said
and
they
are
always
jumping
the
constabulary
attacking
small
parties
suddenly
from
ambush
and
cutting
them
down
with
their
knives
or
killing
sentries
so
that
constant
care
has
to
be
used
and
the
sentinels
walk
at
night
in
twos
almost
back
to
back
so
as
to
have
eyes
on
all
sides
a
few
weeks
before
we
arrived
there
had
been
several
cases
of
jumping
an
american
army
officer
told
me
the
fights
with
the
moros
generally
occurred
on
the
trails
among
the
hills
as
the
foliage
is
so
thick
it
is
easy
for
the
natives
to
conceal
themselves
on
either
side
sometimes
in
ditches
and
give
the
americans
a
surprise
for
this
reason
a
drill
was
found
necessary
for
single
file
fighting
every
other
soldier
was
taught
to
respond
to
the
order
of
one
and
two
when
an
attack
was
made
the
ones
shot
to
the
right
the
twos
to
the
left
this
proved
successful
the
same
officer
said
the
moros
would
often
use
decoys
to
lead
the
troops
astray
seeing
fresh
tracks
they
would
hasten
on
in
pursuit
and
be
led
away
from
their
supplies
while
their
enemy
would
be
left
behind
to
attack
them
in
the
rear
walking
on
the
mountain
trails
was
very
hard
on
the
soldiers
shoes
and
on
one
of
these
expeditions
their
boots
gave
out
so
they
were
obliged
to
make
soles
for
their
shoes
out
of
boxes
and
tie
them
on
with
leather
straps
up
up
we
drove
the
clatter
of
the
cavalry
could
be
heard
in
front
and
behind
and
the
dougherty
how
it
did
rattle
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
party
traveling
through
the
tropical
forests
and
winding
across
the
green
uplands
with
their
pennons
and
the
secretary
red
flag
which
made
a
great
impression
on
the
natives
we
heard
and
the
wagons
rumbling
along
with
a
rearguard
behind
and
the
scouts
in
the
distance
john
the
coloured
man
snapped
his
whip
and
the
mules
trotted
along
and
the
air
became
cooler
and
we
drove
over
a
plain
where
real
mountain
rice
was
planted
occasionally
a
moro
shack
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
at
an
outpost
where
we
stopped
to
change
mules
we
saw
a
beautiful
waterfall
perhaps
the
loveliest
that
i
had
ever
seen
called
santa
maria
cristina
from
a
greater
height
than
niagara
it
plunged
down
into
a
deep
valley
of
giant
trees
it
reminded
me
of
a
superb
waterfall
near
seattle
at
last
we
reached
camp
keithley
on
the
mountain
plain
a
forlorn
lot
of
unpainted
houses
with
tin
roofs
and
piazzas
but
beautifully
situated
like
some
station
in
the
himalayas
there
was
splendid
mountain
scenery
disappearing
into
the
distances
and
views
of
the
ocean
far
away
and
on
the
other
side
the
great
lake
of
lanao
an
inland
sea
more
than
two
thousand
feet
above
the
ocean
with
imposing
ranges
about
this
lake
which
has
always
been
the
center
of
moro
life
is
surrounded
by
native
villages
and
the
military
post
is
important
and
much
liked
by
the
officers
quartered
there
the
secretary
my
husband
and
i
were
billeted
on
major
beacom
the
commanding
officer
dickinson
had
not
felt
quite
equal
to
the
trip
the
major
house
was
very
attractive
and
his
little
german
housekeeper
gave
us
excellent
food
and
made
the
orderlies
fly
about
for
our
comfort
we
went
almost
at
once
to
the
market
place
which
was
intensely
interesting
the
gorgeous
colours
and
gold
buttons
of
the
costumes
were
magnificent
brass
bowls
for
chow
were
for
sale
and
boxes
inlaid
with
silver
and
round
silver
ones
with
instruments
attached
to
clean
the
ears
and
nose
there
are
four
compartments
in
these
boxes
for
lime
tobacco
the
betel
nut
and
a
leaf
in
which
to
wrap
the
mixture
called
buyo
here
we
saw
the
spear
and
shield
dance
the
dancer
had
a
headdress
that
covered
his
forehead
and
ears
making
him
look
quite
ridiculous
absolutely
as
though
he
were
on
the
comic
opera
stage
with
shield
and
spear
he
danced
as
swiftly
and
silently
as
a
cat
creeping
and
springing
until
your
blood
ran
cold
especially
as
you
knew
he
had
killed
many
a
man
in
the
afternoon
after
reviewing
the
troops
and
inspecting
the
quarters
we
crossed
a
corner
of
the
lake
and
landed
at
a
moro
village
it
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
we
waded
through
a
street
followed
by
the
people
in
their
best
clothes
one
in
a
black
velvet
suit
another
in
a
violet
velvet
jacket
i
saw
only
two
women
in
the
streets
they
were
not
veiled
nor
brilliantly
dressed
but
had
red
painted
lips
and
henna
on
their
nails
the
moro
constabulary
here
wore
red
fezzes
and
khaki
and
the
officer
in
command
at
the
time
was
of
german
birth
after
we
had
passed
through
a
bamboo
trail
we
came
into
a
little
open
place
with
three
fine
moro
houses
about
set
up
above
the
ground
on
great
posts
made
of
tree
trunks
unlike
filipino
houses
they
had
façades
all
carved
in
a
rough
and
handsome
sort
of
arabesque
painted
in
bright
reds
and
blues
and
with
pointed
roofs
and
coloured
cloths
fluttering
out
of
the
open
spaces
they
made
fine
effects
the
long
cracks
in
the
walls
served
as
peepholes
where
the
snapping
black
eyes
of
the
many
wives
of
the
datos
were
peering
out
at
us
in
front
in
the
little
green
space
pennons
were
planted
and
there
was
a
huge
sea
serpent
or
dragon
on
wheels
with
a
body
of
gaily
coloured
stuffs
and
a
rearing
movable
head
this
cavorted
about
in
time
to
the
endless
noise
of
the
a
crowd
of
natives
stood
round
in
their
fanciful
raiment
illustration
a
moro
house
into
one
of
these
houses
we
were
invited
we
mounted
the
ladder
to
the
one
large
room
in
the
front
into
which
the
sliding
panel
shutters
admitted
the
air
freely
so
that
it
was
cool
and
shaded
here
sat
the
wives
and
the
slaves
in
a
corner
playing
on
a
long
wooden
instrument
with
brass
pans
which
they
struck
producing
high
and
low
sounds
with
a
little
more
tune
than
the
igorots
the
big
room
was
bare
except
for
a
long
shelf
on
which
was
some
woven
cloth
and
a
fine
collection
of
the
native
brass
work
for
this
is
the
center
of
the
we
moved
on
through
the
little
town
of
nipa
houses
to
visit
old
dato
manilibang
whose
house
was
not
as
fine
as
those
we
had
seen
before
but
where
we
were
admitted
into
two
rooms
from
the
entrance
we
streaked
muddy
feet
across
the
floor
into
his
reception
room
where
a
sort
of
divan
occupied
one
side
on
which
the
secretary
was
asked
to
sit
behind
this
cushioned
seat
were
piled
the
boxes
with
the
chief
possessions
and
here
he
sits
in
state
in
the
daytime
and
sleeps
at
night
the
women
who
were
huddled
together
on
one
side
of
the
room
wore
bracelets
and
rings
and
one
was
rather
pretty
at
dawn
we
were
up
and
off
again
what
a
day
we
had
two
hours
on
a
boat
crossing
a
lovely
lake
surrounded
by
mountains
on
the
shore
of
which
some
of
the
wildest
moros
live
our
boat
was
a
big
launch
a
sort
of
gunboat
which
strangely
enough
the
spaniards
had
brought
up
here
and
sunk
in
the
lake
when
the
war
came
on
we
were
told
and
which
had
been
resurrected
successfully
it
was
a
steep
climb
up
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
but
most
of
us
scrambled
up
on
horses
till
we
topped
the
ridge
and
came
to
camp
vickers
a
station
with
fine
air
and
outlook
but
rather
small
and
pathetic
the
picturesque
moros
had
gathered
here
to
greet
the
secretary
and
their
wail
of
welcome
was
something
strange
and
weird
a
dato
would
come
swinging
by
followed
in
single
file
by
his
carrier
chow
bearer
and
slaves
some
of
the
chiefs
rode
scraggly
ponies
on
high
saddles
with
their
big
toes
in
stirrups
of
cord
almost
up
under
their
chins
and
with
bells
on
the
harness
that
rattled
gaily
and
of
course
the
kept
up
their
endless
music
we
had
two
more
hours
of
horseback
riding
we
hoped
to
see
a
boar
hunt
but
owing
to
some
misunderstanding
it
did
not
come
off
then
after
a
luncheon
at
major
brown
we
started
down
the
trail
again
in
a
dougherty
illustration
bagobo
man
with
pointed
teeth
it
was
a
beautiful
drive
through
this
forest
on
the
island
of
mindanao
we
first
crossed
open
grassy
uplands
then
dipped
down
through
the
great
glades
of
the
most
tropical
forest
i
have
ever
seen
with
towering
hard
woods
and
tree
ferns
with
bamboos
and
clinging
air
plants
and
orchids
and
there
was
mystery
and
wonder
about
the
giant
growths
the
trees
seemed
taller
than
the
elms
of
new
england
or
the
cedars
of
oregon
they
dripped
with
clinging
vines
which
grew
covering
everything
the
grass
too
with
waving
purple
tassels
grew
higher
than
a
man
head
twice
as
high
as
the
pigmy
brown
people
who
have
their
houses
in
these
trees
the
just
referred
to
are
the
manobos
and
the
bagobos
with
pointed
teeth
for
mindanao
is
not
entirely
inhabited
by
moros
there
are
supposed
to
be
no
less
than
tribes
on
this
island
alone
they
build
in
trees
to
escape
the
spear
thrusts
of
their
neighbours
through
the
bamboo
floors
we
were
to
make
their
acquaintance
later
a
drenching
rain
came
on
that
afternoon
through
which
the
escort
jogged
along
while
we
clung
in
our
dougherties
nearly
shaken
to
pieces
and
reached
malabang
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
as
much
fatigued
as
if
we
had
been
on
horseback
all
the
way
the
military
post
here
was
most
attractive
with
the
prettiest
of
nipa
houses
for
the
officers
and
the
parade
lined
with
shading
palms
and
walks
a
charming
station
we
were
quartered
with
lieutenant
barry
and
his
wife
a
delightful
young
couple
in
their
thatched
house
and
dined
with
major
sargent
the
commanding
officer
who
has
written
some
good
books
on
military
topics
the
celebes
sea
was
calm
and
lovely
when
we
left
malabang
we
passed
along
the
coast
of
mindanao
toward
a
long
lowland
that
lay
between
the
high
mountains
of
the
island
this
was
the
plain
of
the
cotobato
a
great
river
which
overflows
its
banks
annually
like
the
nile
and
has
formed
a
fertile
valley
that
could
be
turned
to
good
account
the
mouth
of
the
river
is
shallow
so
that
we
were
transferred
to
a
boat
that
was
waiting
and
began
to
work
our
way
up
against
the
rapid
current
past
low
uninteresting
banks
that
were
proving
rather
monotonous
when
suddenly
we
turned
a
point
and
saw
the
town
of
cotobato
the
moros
and
the
other
tribes
were
in
their
full
splendour
here
soon
down
this
tropical
river
where
crocodiles
dozed
and
monkeys
chattered
and
paroquets
shrieked
there
came
a
flotilla
from
the
arabian
nights
manned
by
galley
slaves
on
the
masts
and
poles
of
one
of
the
barges
floated
banners
and
under
the
canopy
of
green
sat
a
real
princess
some
of
the
boats
were
only
dugouts
with
outriggers
but
they
were
decorated
too
and
all
the
tribes
were
dressed
in
silks
and
velvets
of
the
brightest
colours
there
was
great
excitement
and
much
cheering
as
we
approached
the
landing
stage
and
the
troops
stood
at
attention
while
the
rest
of
the
shore
was
alive
with
the
throng
of
natives
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
the
secretary
inspected
the
troops
and
we
saw
for
the
first
time
the
moro
constabulary
wearing
turbans
and
sashes
but
with
bare
legs
nevertheless
they
looked
very
dashing
indeed
the
moros
were
so
different
in
character
and
appearance
from
any
people
we
had
seen
before
that
they
might
as
well
have
come
down
from
the
stars
the
secretary
was
taken
to
meet
the
datos
as
they
stood
in
line
beneath
the
great
trees
with
the
motley
crowds
of
retainers
behind
them
in
such
a
medley
of
colours
as
i
had
never
imagined
before
the
sunlight
filtered
through
the
trees
upon
the
barbaric
costumes
while
the
gaily
dressed
women
stood
behind
the
men
and
peered
over
them
the
brown
men
looked
dignified
and
very
too
although
the
scene
was
like
the
setting
of
a
comic
opera
where
the
imagination
had
been
allowed
to
run
riot
there
we
saw
dato
piang
and
gimbungen
a
very
fat
dato
what
a
delightful
name
also
ynock
whose
ear
had
been
cut
off
in
a
fight
we
were
told
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
he
said
he
had
clapped
it
onto
his
face
again
and
tied
it
on
and
it
had
grown
there
so
it
hung
attached
somewhere
down
on
his
cheek
and
gave
him
a
very
peculiar
appearance
when
the
moros
conquered
the
filipinos
this
dato
had
the
captured
women
stripped
and
made
to
walk
before
him
and
then
took
them
off
to
the
mountains
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
later
by
the
filipinos
he
was
compelled
to
work
in
chains
in
the
streets
under
a
canopy
the
princess
received
us
a
native
woman
whose
descent
was
traced
for
many
hundreds
of
years
said
to
be
a
pure
moro
although
she
looked
rather
chinese
and
who
was
recognized
as
of
the
highest
social
superiority
but
had
little
political
power
she
herself
was
draped
in
varied
colours
while
her
chamberlain
wore
a
brocade
coat
of
crimson
and
gold
cloth
behind
her
stood
her
maids
bearing
the
gold
boxes
and
chow
trays
and
umbrellas
of
her
rank
our
luncheon
with
the
commanding
officer
major
heiberg
and
his
wife
was
eaten
in
delightful
little
kiosks
of
nipa
and
bamboo
which
had
been
built
in
a
small
palm
grove
the
dancing
girls
of
the
princess
who
had
long
nails
protected
by
silver
covers
gave
us
a
performance
afterward
curiously
enough
their
dance
was
very
japanese
in
character
then
some
manobos
picturesque
in
short
trousers
and
bolero
jackets
with
bags
and
boxes
beautifully
worked
in
bright
beads
danced
a
graceful
monotonous
step
the
women
have
a
swaying
dance
with
waving
arms
and
jingling
of
bracelets
and
hiplets
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
coin
the
word
at
last
after
so
many
adventures
we
found
ourselves
again
on
board
the
an
enchanting
spot
on
this
boat
was
a
projection
over
the
bow
on
which
one
could
sit
curled
up
high
above
the
water
on
this
perch
we
felt
like
the
sea
gulls
that
circled
far
above
us
we
passed
over
a
sea
of
polished
jade
which
at
night
shone
with
phosphorescence
like
gleaming
silver
next
morning
august
we
approached
zamboanga
five
american
ships
all
decorated
came
steaming
out
to
meet
us
and
fell
in
behind
in
order
making
a
lovely
sight
on
the
bright
smooth
seas
as
we
neared
the
town
we
suddenly
saw
a
large
flotilla
of
native
boats
with
beating
and
thousands
of
flags
fluttering
such
a
gay
sight
banners
of
all
shapes
streaming
and
flapping
and
waving
and
such
colours
and
combinations
of
colours
stripes
of
green
and
purple
and
orange
in
designs
of
lemon
and
red
and
magenta
serpentine
flags
and
square
ones
hung
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
brightly
coloured
canopies
under
which
sat
the
sultans
and
green
umbrellas
and
yellow
and
bang
off
went
their
small
lantankas
tiny
cannon
a
most
exciting
reception
we
landed
under
triumphal
arches
and
were
driven
in
state
carriages
through
lines
of
school
children
who
sang
and
threw
us
flowers
from
old
spanish
gardens
the
post
was
really
beautiful
for
it
had
much
left
from
old
spanish
times
and
what
had
been
done
over
had
been
done
with
taste
the
green
parade
had
a
terraced
canal
passing
through
it
and
avenues
of
palm
the
officers
quarters
smothered
in
flowering
plants
and
fronting
out
over
the
glittering
blue
sea
were
large
and
airy
and
finer
than
any
we
had
seen
before
it
is
considered
one
of
the
best
posts
in
the
philippines
and
seemed
cool
and
pleasant
illustration
bagobos
with
musical
instruments
there
was
the
usual
procession
first
the
troops
of
the
garrison
and
the
constabulary
then
thousands
of
visiting
moros
bagobos
and
manobos
of
every
colour
of
skin
and
clothes
many
of
them
whooping
and
leaping
and
then
a
tiresome
following
of
hundreds
of
filipinos
who
had
joined
in
to
make
a
political
demonstration
it
is
said
the
filipinos
did
not
wish
the
moros
to
take
part
in
the
procession
exciting
times
followed
at
the
meeting
after
this
parade
where
both
filipino
and
moro
speakers
were
heard
said
a
filipino
addressing
the
secretary
you
have
just
visited
our
province
and
have
just
learned
its
conditions
at
such
places
in
it
through
which
you
have
passed
you
must
have
seen
quite
a
number
of
moros
but
i
believe
that
a
separation
could
very
well
be
established
to
the
end
that
both
people
the
christian
filipino
and
the
filipino
moro
might
have
the
government
that
corresponds
respectively
to
each
of
them
for
it
is
a
very
regrettable
thing
that
on
account
of
the
presence
of
the
latter
we
christians
should
be
unable
to
enjoy
the
liberties
that
reason
and
right
would
grant
us
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
advise
you
that
the
moros
who
filed
past
the
grandstand
were
brought
from
remote
and
distant
places
with
the
exclusive
purpose
of
giving
greater
éclat
to
your
reception
moreover
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
always
in
dealing
with
the
affairs
of
this
province
that
the
moros
have
no
political
influence
possess
no
property
nor
help
pay
the
expense
of
the
government
then
dato
mandi
spoke
i
am
here
el
raja
mura
mandi
representing
the
moros
as
i
look
about
i
see
far
more
moros
than
the
filipino
contingent
and
if
that
is
so
that
is
the
reason
it
is
called
the
moro
province
tremendous
applause
from
the
moros
when
first
the
americans
came
here
from
the
very
beginning
whatever
they
asked
me
to
do
i
did
i
was
loyal
to
them
ever
now
i
have
heard
a
rumour
that
we
moros
are
in
the
hands
of
the
filipinos
if
the
american
government
does
not
want
the
moro
province
any
more
they
should
give
it
back
to
us
it
is
a
moro
province
it
belongs
to
us
tremendous
applause
by
the
moros
dato
sacaluran
threw
down
the
moro
challenge
i
am
an
old
man
i
do
not
want
any
more
trouble
but
if
it
should
come
to
that
that
we
shall
be
given
over
to
the
filipinos
i
still
would
fight
applause
but
hadji
nangnui
who
spoke
of
himself
as
a
samal
made
the
clearest
statement
of
the
moro
position
the
secretary
of
war
must
look
the
matter
in
the
face
we
are
a
different
race
we
have
a
different
religion
we
are
mohammedans
and
if
we
should
be
given
over
to
the
filipinos
how
much
more
would
they
treat
us
badly
than
they
treated
even
the
spanish
badly
who
were
their
own
mothers
and
their
own
fathers
in
generations
how
did
they
treat
them
think
about
it
think
twice
we
far
prefer
to
be
in
the
hands
of
the
americans
who
are
father
and
mother
to
us
now
than
to
be
turned
over
to
another
people
applause
in
the
evening
we
dined
delightfully
at
the
pershings
after
dinner
the
moros
danced
in
the
garden
the
spear
and
shield
dance
and
the
bagobo
women
gave
the
scarf
dance
the
bagobos
still
offer
human
sacrifices
their
caps
if
tied
in
a
certain
way
show
how
many
men
they
have
killed
their
dress
is
made
of
cloth
which
they
weave
from
carefully
selected
and
dyed
fibers
of
manila
hemp
and
it
is
treated
with
wax
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
very
smooth
and
durable
in
the
glow
of
the
red
light
from
chino
charlie
famous
lanterns
their
picturesque
costumes
gleaming
with
bead
work
added
much
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
scene
they
love
music
and
make
some
large
stringed
instruments
they
also
play
the
flute
from
the
nose
with
one
nostril
stopped
up
like
the
hawaiians
the
dancing
under
the
palms
in
the
garden
by
the
rippling
seas
where
the
moonlight
flooded
down
radiantly
was
quite
like
a
strange
dream
at
this
dinner
i
was
told
the
story
given
by
dean
worcester
by
which
the
moros
explain
why
they
do
not
eat
pork
mahamoud
had
a
grandson
and
a
granddaughter
as
he
was
king
of
the
world
christ
came
to
his
house
to
visit
him
mahamoud
jealous
of
him
told
him
to
prove
his
power
by
what
he
had
in
a
certain
room
where
in
fact
were
his
grandchildren
christ
replied
that
he
had
no
wish
to
prove
his
power
and
would
not
mahamoud
then
vowed
that
if
he
did
not
answer
correctly
he
should
pay
for
it
with
his
life
christ
responded
have
two
animals
in
there
different
from
anything
else
in
the
world
mahamoud
replied
you
are
wrong
and
i
will
now
kill
you
christ
said
first
and
see
for
yourself
mahamoud
opened
the
door
and
out
rushed
two
hogs
into
which
christ
had
changed
his
grandchildren

some
verses
recited
at
general

showed
the
feeling
of
army
officers
about
their
life
in
the
philippines
a
stanza
runs
what
is
it
makes
us
fret
so
hard
in
this
benighted
land
it
is
lack
of
courage
and
it
is
lack
of
it
is
fear
of
moros
or
bagobos
from
the
hills
it
the
many
great
discomforts
and
the
many
many
ills
it
is
interesting
to
read
in
a
recent
number
of
the
manila
that
zamboanga
which
seemed
so
like
a
picture
handed
down
from
spanish
days
has
absorbed
a
good
share
of
american
progressiveness
and
is
said
to
stand
in
a
class
by
itself
among
philippine
towns
waterworks
and
a
plant
are
under
construction
the
water
for
which
is
to
be
brought
along
the
mountainside
a
part
of
the
way
through
tunnels
to
dig
these
experienced
igorot
tunnel
makers
from
benguet
were
imported
who
are
getting
along
amicably
with
the
moros
at
jolo
or
sulu
we
were
again
greeted
by
a
moro
fleet
and
some
diving
girls
and
boys
this
seemed
the
culmination
of
the
picturesque
in
our
trip
the
mountains
of
the
island
are
not
high
but
rather
and
as
we
approached
the
town
we
could
see
behind
it
the
forested
slopes
of
steep
bud
dajo
where
the
great
fight
took
place
in
and
many
moros
were
killed
in
the
crater
top
of
the
volcano
to
which
they
had
retreated
and
from
which
they
challenged
and
threatened
the
american
forces
it
is
an
island
of
fierce
piratical
moros
and
even
the
americans
had
not
tried
to
do
much
there
it
was
dangerous
to
go
outside
the
little
walled
town
at
all
and
all
the
natives
coming
in
were
searched
for
their
weapons
which
were
taken
away
at
the
gates
only
a
few
months
before
a
fanatic
moro
tried
to
attack
the
gate
guard
but
fortunately
was
killed
before
fatally
injuring
any
one
illustration
moro
boats
the
walled
town
is
a
most
artistic
little
spanish
place
built
once
upon
a
time
by
the
exiled
spanish
governor
asturia
who
made
it
a
gem
of
a
town
with
small
balustraded
plazas
and
a
sea
wall
and
a
miniature
wall
with
battlements
and
gates
and
streets
set
out
with
shading
trees
the
pretty
officers
club
and
quarters
overhung
the
wall
the
gates
of
the
town
are
closed
at
night
and
all
the
natives
must
leave
for
their
houses
outside
before
the
retreat
but
there
is
a
native
market
and
a
town
built
out
on
piles
over
the
water
which
we
visited
we
drove
out
to
a
plain
and
backed
by
mountains
that
overlooked
the
sea
where
there
was
a
review
of
the
cavalry
and
a
large
company
of
mounted
moros
who
carried
many
american
flags
among
their
waving
banners
within
the
walls
in
a
grandstand
in
the
little
plaza
where
the
natives
thronged
there
was
a
meeting
between
the
secretary
and
the
chief
datos
and
the
hadji
who
had
been
vizier
of
the
sultan
made
a
wise
speech
full
of
promise
of
loyalty
our
governor
had
won
the
good
will
of
the
people
about
him
and
the
hadji
said
that
when
his
people
were
certain
of
our
good
intentions
they
would
come
in
willingly
and
be
loyal
but
for
so
many
years
they
had
been
misled
by
previous
rulers
we
amused
ourselves
by
going
to
chino
charlie
and
buying
lanterns
and
lunched
at
the
officers
club
afterward
we
went
out
on
the
pier
inhabited
by
the
chinese
and
looked
for
pearls
jolo
pearls
are
famous
but
we
saw
none
of
real
value
we
watched
the
chinamen
drying
copra
and
went
through
their
market
where
water
slugs
were
for
sale
finally
we
sailed
across
the
bay
our
visit
to
the
moros
was
full
of
colour
to
the
end
for
the
sun
was
setting
gorgeously
as
we
put
out
to

chapter
x
journey
end
the
little
coral
island
of
bancoran
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
sulu
sea
quite
outside
the
usual
routes
of
travel
it
is
inhabited
only
by
birds
and
people
seldom
or
never
go
there
but
we
wanted
to
obtain
if
we
could
some
new
species
of
gulls
or
terns
for
the
bureau
of
science
at
manila
and
also
to
enjoy
the
mysterious
sea
gardens
which
are
found
among
the
southern
reefs
just
after
tiffin
the
island
was
sighted
lying
quite
alone
by
itself
in
milky
green
water
the
ship
stopped
and
launches
were
dropped
overboard
and
a
boat
which
had
been
brought
along
for
our
use
the
afternoon
was
ideal
the
sky
blue
and
fleeced
with
snowy
clouds
piled
high
while
the
intense
sun
shining
on
the
water
flashed
back
a
hundred
shades
of
blue
and
green
and
mauve
on
one
side
of
the
island
which
floated
like
an
emerald
among
sapphires
outstanding
rocks
chafed
the
seas
into
foaming
surf
while
on
the
other
a
long
narrow
beach
lay
shimmering
pale
yellow
in
the
sunlight
the
island
itself
was
covered
with
a
thick
jungle
of
trees
which
were
dotted
with
thousands
of
resting
birds
as
we
drew
nearer
they
saw
us
and
were
afraid
rising
and
soaring
and
circling
in
the
clear
pure
air
and
crying
out
at
us
flock
after
flock
of
sea
fowl
flew
wonderingly
over
our
small
craft
their
white
breasts
tinted
green
with
the
light
reflected
from
the
water
it
was
like
a
robinson
crusoe
island
lost
out
there
in
the
lonely
sea
but
there
were
shells
of
huge
turtles
and
bones
of
birds
which
suggested
that
sometime
a
feast
must
have
been
held
there
so
it
was
not
wholly
undiscovered
and
unexplored
among
the
great
roots
of
the
trees
the
birds
had
built
their
nests
from
leaves
the
eggs
in
some
of
them
were
white
and
about
the
size
of
hens
eggs
several
varieties
of
boobies
and
terns
were
found
some
brown
with
eyes
others
a
few
specimens
were
shot
and
one
or
two
were
taken
back
alive
to
the
for
the
museum
previous
to
this
visit
the
ornithologists
had
never
known
to
what
islands
the
boobies
and
frigate
birds
came
to
nest
although
the
scientists
had
long
been
searching
for
the
place
so
the
expedition
was
well
worth
while
but
the
sea
gardens
interested
me
more
than
the
birds
or
even
the
island
if
alice
could
have
had
her
choice
in
entering
wonderland
she
would
surely
have
selected
a
doorway
leading
through
a
boat
instead
of
dropping
down
a
rabbit
hole
beneath
the
water
which
was
crystal
clear
we
could
see
a
strange
country
with
new
flowers
and
peculiar
creatures
where
it
was
sandy
and
shallow
we
saw
below
us
fields
of
green
sea
grass
on
which
the
fairies
must
surely
have
used
it
was
so
neatly
kept
interspersed
among
the
fields
were
beds
of
feathery
vegetation
unnamed
in
the
language
of
our
party
passing
one
expanse
after
another
of
this
submarine
pasturage
we
saw
depressions
in
the
coral
where
tiny
fishes
played
or
unknown
water
creatures
had
established
a
little
world
for
themselves
and
were
living
in
its
narrow
confines
quite
unconscious
of
what
went
on
in
the
surrounding
vastness
drifting
on
into
deeper
water
we
came
to
a
gray
world
of
curls
and
feathers
trembling
with
life
a
forest
of
pale
trees
and
swaying
brown
ones
of
high
hills
and
dark
valleys
made
by
coral
reefs
pretty
rock
gardens
came
into
view
where
there
were
cabbages
with
blue
edges
sea
anemones
and
purple
fans
a
huge
toadstool
a
giant
fungus
and
a
cactus
plant
at
least
that
is
what
they
looked
like
to
us
there
were
rainbow
shells
too
half
hidden
and
great
blue
starfish
clinging
to
the
rocks
in
and
out
among
the
sponges
and
the
brown
coral
branches
which
were
so
much
like
antlers
swam
curious
fishes
such
gorgeous
colours
so
vivid
and
in
such
brilliant
combinations
some
were
big
green
fellows
with
needle
noses
others
were
electric
blue
and
silver
there
were
black
and
yellow
ones
too
and
striped
fishes
that
looked
like
sly
prisoners
dodging
their
keepers
illustration
one
day
catch
of
fish
we
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
marooned
on
this
island
some
of
us
going
bathing
off
the
shallow
sandy
beaches
in
the
clear
water
as
evening
came
on
we
regretfully
left
the
fairy
island
of
bancoran
and
sailed
away
by
the
rising
moon
the
penal
colony
on
palawan
which
i
have
described
in
another
chapter
was
our
next
point
of
interest
we
left
there
behind
schedule
and
met
a
stronger
current
than
we
had
expected
sweeping
down
the
coast
of
panay
so
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
we
were
late
in
approaching
iloilo
this
was
especially
unfortunate
for
very
generous
preparations
had
been
made
there
for
the
secretary
reception
and
an
interesting
series
of
events
arranged
all
of
which
was
upset
by
the
delay
it
was
sunset
when
we
finally
sighted
the
town
as
we
cruised
up
the
steeply
palisaded
coast
with
the
foreground
of
panay
on
the
other
side
backed
by
its
fine
ranges
of
mountains
the
effects
were
most
beautiful
the
old
spanish
fort
on
its
point
looked
mysterious
in
the
afterglow
and
the
skies
were
magnificently
alight
a
fleet
of
much
beflagged
launches
and
steamers
came
out
to
meet
the
secretary
whistling
a
welcome
and
turning
escorted
the
next
to
manila
iloilo
is
the
most
important
port
in
the
islands
and
has
a
better
climate
than
its
rival
the
people
here
are
supposed
to
be
wealthier
and
more
aristocratic
than
elsewhere
the
payne
bill
which
had
been
in
operation
only
a
short
time
had
brought
such
a
return
of
prosperity
to
the
land
and
especially
to
the
planters
of
this
fertile
province
that
they
were
all
very
enthusiastic
about
americans
and
did
all
they
could
to
express
their
gratitude
we
were
invited
for
dinner
at
half
after
seven
but
it
was
an
hour
later
before
we
sat
down
to
the
long
table
in
the
large
and
rather
empty
room
with
its
handsome
venetian
mirrors
at
either
end
and
its
sliding
shutters
wide
open
to
the
night
there
were
no
ladies
present
except
those
of
our
party
we
could
never
tell
how
things
would
be
arranged
sometimes
there
would
be
filipina
ladies
and
sometimes
there
would
not
sometimes
the
ladies
would
all
be
placed
together
at
one
side
of
the
table
and
again
they
would
be
seated
next
to
the
men
while
waiting
for
dinner
to
be
announced
we
sat
about
in
an
airy
room
with
servants
peeping
in
at
us
and
a
phonograph
playing
caruso
records
illustration
view
in
iloilo
iloilo
showing
high
school
grounds
after
dinner
we
had
a
long
drive
out
through
the
town
which
seemed
quite
and
prosperous
they
had
rebuilt
some
of
the
fine
large
houses
most
of
which
had
been
destroyed
by
the
insurrectos
on
the
nearby
island
of
negros
we
were
told
there
were
many
fine
with
great
houses
full
of
carved
work
which
i
was
sorry
not
to
see
passing
through
suburbs
of
nipa
houses
standing
up
on
their
stilts
in
the
moonlight
we
came
to
a
plaza
gaily
illuminated
and
to
our
destination
a
mansion
approached
by
a
triumphal
arch
in
the
best
houses
the
living
rooms
are
on
the
second
floor
just
as
in
the
poorer
ones
they
are
raised
above
the
ground
on
stilts
so
here
we
went
upstairs
to
a
great
room
hung
with
festoons
of
flags
where
the
little
women
in
their
bright
and
varied
dresses
passing
and
repassing
made
a
gay
scene
it
was
here
indeed
that
we
saw
some
of
the
prettiest
and
best
dressed
women
whom
we
met
on
our
trip
most
of
the
following
day
was
spent
cruising
along
the
coast
of
panay
passing
between
its
fine
outlying
islands
which
reminded
us
of
the
inland
sea
of
japan
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
river
on
which
capiz
is
located
the
secretary
crossed
overland
on
the
first
train
to
run
on
the
new
railway
in
order
to
drive
in
the
silver
spikes
that
completed
the
line
no
dinners
had
been
planned
there
for
those
of
us
who
had
come
by
ship
so
we
did
not
start
up
river
until
half
after
eight
capiz
is
only
four
miles
from
the
mouth
but
they
were
the
longest
miles
we
had
ever
experienced
for
by
some
mistake
the
pilot
did
not
arrive
so
we
went
in
a
launch
without
one
we
just
struggled
along
as
well
as
we
could
in
the
dark
till
the
moon
came
up
which
only
mystified
us
the
more
with
its
deceptive
shadows
half
a
dozen
times
we
ran
deep
into
mud
banks
and
the
sailormen
were
forced
to
jump
overboard
and
shove
us
off
they
did
not
appear
to
enjoy
doing
this
and
no
wonder
for
it
was
a
crocodile
river
swarms
of
fireflies
which
gathered
on
favourite
trees
made
a
very
effect
with
their
throbbing
lights
they
were
lovely
too
in
the
dark
shore
shadows
and
made
sparkling
reflections
in
the
black
river
stream
watching
them
we
could
almost
forget
our
troubles
illustration
the
old
augustinian
church
manila
finally
after
much
winding
round
and
backing
off
we
turned
a
bend
and
saw
a
line
of
little
twinkling
lights
strung
along
the
shore
and
on
floating
barges
giving
quite
a
venetian
effect
and
showing
us
the
town
by
their
reflection
landing
we
walked
across
the
grassy
square
to
the
provincial
building
with
its
open
courtyards
where
there
was
to
be
a
ball
we
danced
a
rigodon
as
usual
and
stopped
late
with
the
governor
general
who
liked
to
show
his
interest
in
these
functions
of
which
the
filipinos
think
so
much
there
were
three
bands
which
vied
with
each
other
for
applause
next
morning
we
got
away
early
on
our
last
leg
for
manila
and
the
end
of
our
journey
in
the
land
of
pine
and
palm
that
unfamiliar
country
where
your
head
gets
full
of
strange
thoughts
your
body
of
queer
feelings
and
your
heart
has
great
longings
we
crowded
everything
we
could
into
those
few
last
days
in
manila
for
we
were
loath
to
think
of
leaving
anything
undone
besides
packing
and
shopping
there
were
teas
and
dinners
and
the
army
and
navy
reception
this
was
lovely
for
it
was
held
in
the
courtyard
filled
with
trees
which
were
hung
with
dim
lanterns
the
good
looking
officers
with
their
white
duck
uniforms
and
brass
buttons
added
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
scene
the
men
of
our
party
were
even
busier
than
we
for
they
had
several
banquets
to
which
we
were
not
invited
in
my
husband
journal
i
find
the
chronicle
of
a
typical
day
after
describing
the
events
of
a
busy
morning
he
says
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
reception
to
meet
the
constabulary
at
four
the
opening
of
the
new
hospital
a
most
complete
and
wonderful
one
at
half
after
four
the
laying
of
the
corner
stone
at
five
for
the
new
hotel
which
is
a
very
ambitious
project
and
will
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
as
far
as
touring
in
the
philippines
is
concerned
in
the
evening
a
dinner
and
after
that
a
reception
and
a
dance
manila
seemed
more
picturesque
and
to
have
even
more
atmosphere
as
i
came
to
know
it
better
the
old
walls
and
churches
and
plazas
and
corners
and
quarters
the
pasig
with
its
cascos
and
bancas
plying
about
the
narrow
streets
winding
through
the
suburbs
with
old
walls
and
peeps
of
tangled
gardens
within
and
balustraded
terraces
and
the
bowers
of
the
pink
blossoming
chain
of
love

there
was

it
was
when
the

was
renewed
in
a
revised
form
during
the
administration
of

that
hawaii
ceded
pearl

the

which

the

of

until

stopped
there
on
his

with

first

troops
the
spanish
governor
had
not
even
heard
that
war
was
declared
and
when
the
ships
fired
he
thought
it
was
a
salute
in
his
honour
he
surrendered

the
party
at
present
in
power
in
the
united

appears
to
have
given
very
little
attention
to
the
islands
except
as
a
source
of
income
for
deserving
democrats
if
we
may
judge
from
the
latest
democratic
platform
that
document
contains
the
promise
as
soon
as
practicable
to
give

territorial

beautiful
los
banos
is
an
old
bathing
establishment
not
far
from
kalamba
where
rizal
was
born
it
is
part
of
a
day
trip
from
manila
to
this
hot
mineral
spring
which
was
a
fashionable
resort
in
days
gone
by
now
an
american
military
hospital
has
been
built
there
the
american
coloured
troops
in
the
philippines
certainly
deserve
mention
they
were
among
the
best
fighters
we
sent
out
there
koxinga
was
really
one
of
the
most
noted
characters
of
the
orient
at
that
time
he
was
the
son
of
a
japanese
mother
and
a
chinese
father
and
seldom
has
china
had
a
man
to
compare
with
him
in
courage
enterprise
and
ability
at
the
age
of
he
held
one
of
the
highest
military
commands
in
his
country
with
his
courage
and
natural
ability
it
was
his
purpose
to
carve
out
a
kingdom
for
himself
being
as
shrewd
as
he
was
bold
koxinga
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
dominican
friar
in
amoy
whom
he
converted
into
an
ambassador
and
sent
to
manila
fortunately
for
the
spaniards
koxinga
career
was
cut
short
by
his
early
death
in
while
still
under
forty
years
of
age
and
just
as
he
was
making
preparations
to
invade
the
philippines
aguinaldo
seems
to
be
a
thoroughly
reconstructed
rebel
as
this
incident
told
by
general
anderson
daughter
shows
while
spending
the
day
with
friends
who
have
a
sugar
estate
near
kalamba
our
party
was
augmented
by
aguinaldo
pablo
ocampo
and
another
ilustrado
whose
name
i
forgotten
they
had
come
over
from
cavite
where
aguinaldo
has
his
farm
to
see
this
estate
with
its
modern
sugar
machinery
after
going
over
the
farm
very
thoroughly
with
the
party
i
found
myself
next
the
former
general
at
lunch
conversation
was
difficult
as
he
spoke
no
english
and
not
very
fluent
spanish
i
timidly
asked
him
in
desperation
of
something
to
say
if
he
remembered
my
father
on
learning
that
he
was
the
first
americano
general
to
fight
him
over
fifteen
years
before
he
became
most
interested
and
asked
very
warmly
to
be
remembered
when
i
told
him
my
father
was
also
retired
and
settled
on
his
little
farm
he
was
pleased
and
said
it
was
the
real
life
i
think
he
is
sincerely
a
farmer
and
will
not
be
lured
back
to
the
hazards
of
political
life
he
is
a
modest
quiet
diffident
little
native
of
the
pure
filipino
type
he
assured
me
that
his
children
were
making
good
progress
in
english
and
were
at
school
working
hard
after
taft
had
made
his
journey
to
rome
to
arrange
the
friar
land
question
he
received
a
remarkable
ovation
upon
his
return
to
the
philippines
when
he
was
appointed
secretary
of
war
manila
was
flooded
with
posters
bearing
the
words
in
various
languages
we
want
taft
and
such
a
host
of
petitions
from
influential
citizens
was
sent
to
washington
that
roosevelt
canceled
the
appointment
it
was
not
until
some
time
later
that
it
was
renewed
and
taft
left
the
philippines
to
take
his
seat
in
the
cabinet
at
washington
it
is
difficult
to
realize
the
importance
of
the
mestizo
class
in
the
philippines
there
are
about
thousand
spanish
mestizos
and
half
a
million
chinese
mestizos
any
one
who
is
inclined
to
regret
american
rule
in
the
islands
is
cordially
invited
to
read
chapter
sixteen
in
dean
worcester
book
the
philippines
past
and
present
the
cause
of
the
pneumonic
plague
is
so
little
known
that
it
may
be
interesting
to
mention
it
here
the
disease
it
is
said
is
carried
by
marmots
it
had
not
broken
out
since
the
fourteenth
century
because
manchu
hunters
had
for
generations
been
taught
not
to
kill
marmots
for
this
very
reason
but
in
late
years
with
the
great
demand
for
furs
new
hunters
who
knew
nothing
of
this
killed
the
diseased
marmots
and
so
caused
an
epidemic
the
name
bashee
originally
applied
to
the
batan
islands
was
derived
from
an
intoxicating
drink
of
that
name
made
from
and
berries
it
is
still
used
very
liberally
especially
on
all
festal
occasions
when
dampier
ships
first
touched
these
shores
the
was
highly
regarded
by
these
ancient
mariners
although
we
think
of
japanese
territory
as
far
away
from
ours
here
it
approaches
within
sixty
miles
as
i
have
said
and
within
miles
of
guam
the
japanese
have
lately
occupied
the
former
german
islands
of
the
mariana
group
in
bering
straits
we
are
within
three
miles
of
russian
territory
there
are
two
islands
the
diomedes
in
the
center
of
the
strait
one
of
which
is
owned
by
russia
and
the
other
by
the
united
states
we
usually
consider
both
japan
and
russia
very
far
off
but
their
possessions
are
in
fact
almost
as
near
ours
as
canada
and
mexico
an
interesting
passage
from
worcester
describes
this
kalinga
dance
with
more
detail
into
the
ring
steps
the
hero
of
the
occasion
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
decked
with
his
gaudiest
ornaments
and
bearing
the
shield
lance
and
used
in
the
recent
fights
behind
him
there
creeps
along
the
ground
a
strange
shrinking
figure
clad
in
soiled
garments
with
a
dirty
cotton
blanket
pulled
over
its
head
the
hero
attracts
attention
to
himself
by
emitting
a
squall
which
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
the
yell
of
a
puppy
when
its
tail
is
heavily
trodden
upon
he
then
begins
to
speak
in
a
monotonous
and
highly
artificial
voice
the
tone
and
cadences
of
which
are
strongly
suggestive
of
those
of
a
japanese
actor
with
word
and
gesture
he
describes
his
recent
exploit
using
the
shrinking
figure
beside
him
as
a
dummy
to
represent
his
fallen
foe
when
he
stops
for
breath
the
ganzas
strike
up
again
and
when
their
clangour
ceases
he
resumes
his
narrative
after
concluding
his
pantomimic
discussion
of
his
latest
exploit
he
describes
and
boasts
of
previous
achievements
incidentally
he
indulges
in
high
stepping
and
high
jumping
and
displays
deadly
skill
in
the
manipulation
of
his
weapons
the
crowd
grows
even
more
excited
and
during
the
intervals
while
the
ganzas
are
playing
shrieks
its
approval
and
shrills
its
monotonous
war
cry
finally
when
his
voice
has
grown
hoarse
and
his
muscles
are
tired
the
principal
actor
retires
and
another
takes
his
place
as
darkness
comes
on
a
blazing
fire
is
lighted
within
the
cañao
circle
ultimately
the
young
and
vigorous
warriors
who
participated
in
the
recent
fight
are
succeeded
by
the
old
men
who
have
been
kept
at
home
by
the
burden
of
years
and
infirmities
strong
drink
has
caused
the
dying
fire
in
their
veins
to
flare
up
for
the
moment
each
of
them
has
a
history
of
warlike
deeds
which
he
proceeds
to
recount
the
crowd
already
knows
his
story
by
heart
and
when
the
forgetfulness
of
age
or
that
of
intoxication
causes
him
to
falter
prompts
him
and
shouts
with
laughter
at
the
joke
gradually
the
begins
to
exert
its
stupefying
effect
but
so
long
as
the
music
and
dancing
and
the
shouting
continue
every
one
manages
to
keep
awake
at
last
food
is
passed
and
in
the
interval
during
which
it
is
being
consumed
the
liquor
gets
a
fair
chance
to
work
as
the
east
begins
to
glow
with
the
coming
dawn
men
and
women
fall
asleep
in
their
places
or
hasten
to
their
homes
and
the
cañao
ends
for
the
time
being
at
least
it
is
not
so
well
known
in
this
country
as
in
the
far
east
that
the
fine
code
of
laws
which
we
have
given
the
philippines
was
drafted
by
our
great
statesman
elihu
root
with
the
aid
of
some
suggestions
from
worcester
i
have
taken
a
few
remarks
from
several
speeches
the
ascent
of
mt
mayon
is
dangerous
except
for
experienced
mountain
climbers
the
vista
from
the
summit
is
said
to
surpass
even
the
famous
view
from

a
famous
rival

times
