as
a
token
of
remembrance
and
affectionate
respect
a
second
home
the
rue
du
formerly
one
of
the
darkest
and
most
tortuous
of
the
streets
about
the
hotel
de
ville
zigzagged
round
the
little
gardens
of
the
paris
prefecture
and
ended
at
the
rue
martroi
exactly
at
the
angle
of
an
old
wall
now
pulled
down
here
stood
the
turnstile
to
which
the
street
owed
its
name
it
was
not
removed
till
when
the
municipality
built
a
ballroom
on
the
garden
plot
adjoining
the
hotel
de
ville
for
the
fete
given
in
honor
of
the
duc
d
angouleme
on
his
return
from
spain
the
widest
part
of
the
rue
du
tourniquet
was
the
end
opening
into
the
rue
de
la
tixeranderie
and
even
there
it
was
less
than
six
feet
across
hence
in
rainy
weather
the
gutter
water
was
soon
deep
at
the
foot
of
the
old
houses
sweeping
down
with
it
the
dust
and
refuse
deposited
at
the
by
the
residents
as
the
could
not
pass
through
the
inhabitants
trusted
to
storms
to
wash
their
always
miry
alley
for
how
could
it
be
clean
when
the
summer
sun
shed
its
perpendicular
rays
on
paris
like
a
sheet
of
gold
but
as
piercing
as
the
point
of
a
sword
it
lighted
up
the
blackness
of
this
street
for
a
few
minutes
without
drying
the
permanent
damp
that
rose
from
the
to
the
first
story
of
these
dark
and
silent
tenements
the
residents
who
lighted
their
lamps
at
five
o
clock
in
the
month
of
june
in
winter
never
put
them
out
to
this
day
the
enterprising
wayfarer
who
should
approach
the
marais
along
the
quays
past
the
end
of
the
rue
du
chaume
the
rues
de
l
homme
arme
des
billettes
and
des
all
leading
to
the
rue
du
tourniquet
might
think
he
had
passed
through
cellars
all
the
way
almost
all
the
streets
of
old
paris
of
which
ancient
chronicles
laud
the
magnificence
were
like
this
damp
and
gloomy
labyrinth
where
the
antiquaries
still
find
historical
curiosities
to
admire
for
instance
on
the
house
then
forming
the
corner
where
the
rue
du
tourniquet
joined
the
rue
de
la
tixeranderie
the
clamps
might
still
be
seen
of
two
strong
iron
rings
fixed
to
the
wall
the
relics
of
the
chains
put
up
every
night
by
the
watch
to
secure
public
safety
this
house
remarkable
for
its
antiquity
had
been
constructed
in
a
way
that
bore
witness
to
the
unhealthiness
of
these
old
dwellings
for
to
preserve
the
from
damp
the
arches
of
the
cellars
rose
about
two
feet
above
the
soil
and
the
house
was
entered
up
three
outside
steps
the
door
was
crowned
by
a
closed
arch
of
which
the
keystone
bore
a
female
head
and
some
arabesques
three
windows
their
sills
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
belonged
to
a
small
set
of
rooms
looking
out
on
the
rue
du
tourniquet
whence
they
derived
their
light
these
windows
were
protected
by
strong
iron
bars
very
wide
apart
and
ending
below
in
an
outward
curve
like
the
bars
of
a
baker
s
window
if
any
during
the
day
were
curious
enough
to
peep
into
the
two
rooms
forming
this
little
dwelling
he
could
see
nothing
for
only
under
the
sun
of
july
could
he
discern
in
the
second
room
two
beds
hung
with
green
serge
placed
side
by
side
under
the
paneling
of
an
alcove
but
in
the
afternoon
by
about
three
o
clock
when
the
candles
were
lighted
through
the
pane
of
the
first
room
an
old
woman
might
be
seen
sitting
on
a
stool
by
the
fireplace
where
she
nursed
the
fire
in
a
brazier
to
simmer
a
stew
such
as
porters
wives
are
expert
in
a
few
kitchen
utensils
hung
up
against
the
wall
were
visible
in
the
twilight
at
that
hour
an
old
table
on
trestles
but
bare
of
linen
was
laid
with
and
the
dish
concocted
by
the
old
woman
three
wretched
chairs
were
all
the
furniture
of
this
room
which
was
at
once
the
kitchen
and
the
over
the
were
a
piece
of
a
three
glasses
some
matches
and
a
large
cracked
white
jug
still
the
floor
the
utensils
the
fireplace
all
gave
a
pleasant
sense
of
the
perfect
cleanliness
and
thrift
that
pervaded
the
dull
and
gloomy
home
the
old
woman
s
pale
withered
face
was
quite
in
harmony
with
the
darkness
of
the
street
and
the
mustiness
of
the
place
as
she
sat
there
motionless
in
her
chair
it
might
have
been
thought
that
she
was
as
inseparable
from
the
house
as
a
snail
from
its
brown
shell
her
face
alert
with
a
vague
expression
of
mischief
was
framed
in
a
flat
cap
made
of
net
which
barely
covered
her
white
hair
her
fine
gray
eyes
were
as
quiet
as
the
street
and
the
many
wrinkles
in
her
face
might
be
compared
to
the
cracks
in
the
walls
whether
she
had
been
born
to
poverty
or
had
fallen
from
some
past
splendor
she
now
seemed
to
have
been
long
resigned
to
her
melancholy
existence
from
sunrise
till
dark
excepting
when
she
was
getting
a
meal
ready
or
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
was
out
purchasing
provisions
the
old
woman
sat
in
the
adjoining
room
by
the
further
window
opposite
a
young
girl
at
any
hour
of
the
day
the
could
see
the
needlewoman
seated
in
an
old
red
velvet
chair
bending
over
an
embroidery
frame
and
stitching
indefatigably
her
mother
had
a
green
pillow
on
her
knee
and
busied
herself
with
net
but
her
fingers
could
move
the
bobbin
but
slowly
her
sight
was
feeble
for
on
her
nose
there
rested
a
pair
of
those
antiquated
spectacles
which
keep
their
place
on
the
nostrils
by
the
grip
of
a
spring
by
night
these
two
hardworking
women
set
a
lamp
between
them
and
the
light
concentrated
by
two
bottles
of
water
showed
the
elder
the
fine
network
made
by
the
threads
on
her
pillow
and
the
younger
the
most
delicate
details
of
the
pattern
she
was
embroidering
the
outward
bend
of
the
window
had
allowed
the
girl
to
rest
a
box
of
earth
on
the
in
which
grew
some
sweet
peas
nasturtiums
a
sickly
little
honeysuckle
and
some
convolvulus
that
twined
its
frail
stems
up
the
iron
bars
these
etiolated
plants
produced
a
few
pale
flowers
and
added
a
touch
of
indescribable
sadness
and
sweetness
to
the
picture
offered
by
this
window
in
which
the
two
figures
were
appropriately
framed
the
most
selfish
soul
who
chanced
to
see
this
domestic
scene
would
carry
away
with
him
a
perfect
image
of
the
life
led
in
paris
by
the
working
class
of
women
for
the
embroideress
evidently
lived
by
her
needle
many
as
they
passed
through
the
turnstile
found
themselves
wondering
how
a
girl
could
preserve
her
color
living
in
such
a
cellar
a
student
of
lively
imagination
going
that
way
to
cross
to
the
would
compare
this
obscure
and
vegetative
life
to
that
of
the
ivy
that
clung
to
these
chill
walls
to
that
of
the
peasants
born
to
labor
who
are
born
toil
and
die
unknown
to
the
world
they
have
helped
to
feed
a
after
studying
the
house
with
the
eye
of
a
valuer
would
have
said
what
will
become
of
those
two
women
if
embroidery
should
go
out
of
fashion
among
the
men
who
having
some
appointment
at
the
hotel
de
ville
or
the
palais
de
justice
were
obliged
to
go
through
this
street
at
fixed
hours
either
on
their
way
to
business
or
on
their
return
home
there
may
have
been
some
charitable
soul
some
widower
or
adonis
of
forty
brought
so
often
into
the
secrets
of
these
sad
lives
may
perhaps
have
reckoned
on
the
poverty
of
this
mother
and
daughter
and
have
hoped
to
become
the
master
at
no
great
cost
of
the
innocent
whose
nimble
and
dimpled
fingers
youthful
figure
and
white
skin
a
charm
due
no
doubt
to
living
in
this
sunless
street
had
excited
his
admiration
perhaps
again
some
honest
clerk
with
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
seeing
every
day
the
diligence
the
girl
gave
to
her
needle
and
appreciating
the
purity
of
her
life
was
only
waiting
for
improved
prospects
to
unite
one
humble
life
with
another
one
form
of
toil
to
another
and
to
bring
at
any
rate
a
man
s
arm
and
a
calm
affection
like
the
flowers
in
the
window
to
uphold
this
home
vague
hope
certainly
gave
life
to
the
mother
s
dim
gray
eyes
every
morning
after
the
most
frugal
breakfast
she
took
up
her
pillow
though
chiefly
for
the
look
of
the
thing
for
she
would
lay
her
spectacles
on
a
little
mahogany
worktable
as
old
as
herself
and
look
out
of
the
window
from
about
eight
till
ten
at
the
regular
passers
in
the
street
she
caught
their
glances
remarked
on
their
gait
their
dress
their
countenance
and
almost
seemed
to
be
offering
her
daughter
her
gossiping
eyes
so
evidently
tried
to
attract
some
magnetic
sympathy
by
manoeuvres
worthy
of
the
stage
it
was
evident
that
this
little
review
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
her
and
perhaps
her
single
amusement
the
daughter
rarely
looked
up
modesty
or
a
painful
consciousness
of
poverty
seemed
to
keep
her
eyes
riveted
to
the
and
only
some
exclamation
of
surprise
from
her
mother
moved
her
to
show
her
small
features
then
a
clerk
in
a
new
coat
or
who
unexpectedly
appeared
with
a
woman
on
his
arm
might
catch
sight
of
the
girl
s
slightly
upturned
nose
her
rosy
mouth
and
gray
eyes
always
bright
and
lively
in
spite
of
her
fatiguing
toil
her
late
hours
had
left
a
trace
on
her
face
by
a
pale
circle
marked
under
each
eye
on
the
fresh
rosiness
of
her
cheeks
the
poor
child
looked
as
if
she
were
made
for
love
and
cheerfulness
for
love
which
had
drawn
two
perfect
arches
above
her
eyelids
and
had
given
her
such
a
mass
of
chestnut
hair
that
she
might
have
hidden
under
it
as
under
a
tent
impenetrable
to
the
lover
s
eye
for
cheerfulness
which
gave
quivering
animation
to
her
nostrils
which
carved
two
dimples
in
her
rosy
cheeks
and
made
her
quick
to
forget
her
troubles
cheerfulness
the
blossom
of
hope
which
gave
her
strength
to
look
out
without
shuddering
on
the
barren
path
of
life
the
girl
s
hair
was
always
carefully
dressed
after
the
manner
of
paris
needlewomen
her
toilet
seemed
to
her
quite
complete
when
she
had
brushed
her
hair
smooth
and
tucked
up
the
little
short
curls
that
played
on
each
temple
in
contrast
with
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
the
growth
of
it
on
the
back
of
her
neck
was
so
pretty
and
the
brown
line
so
clearly
traced
gave
such
a
pleasing
idea
of
her
youth
and
charm
that
the
observer
seeing
her
bent
over
her
work
and
unmoved
by
any
sound
was
inclined
to
think
of
her
as
a
coquette
such
inviting
promise
had
excited
the
interest
of
more
than
one
young
man
who
turned
round
in
the
vain
hope
of
seeing
that
modest
countenance
caroline
there
is
a
new
face
that
passes
regularly
by
and
not
one
of
the
old
ones
to
compare
with
these
words
spoken
in
a
low
voice
by
her
mother
one
august
morning
in
had
vanquished
the
young
needlewoman
s
indifference
and
she
looked
out
on
the
street
but
in
vain
the
stranger
was
gone
where
has
he
flown
to
said
she
he
will
come
back
no
doubt
at
four
i
shall
see
him
coming
and
will
touch
your
foot
with
mine
i
am
sure
he
will
come
back
he
has
been
through
the
street
regularly
for
the
last
three
days
but
his
hours
vary
the
first
day
he
came
by
at
six
o
clock
the
day
before
yesterday
it
was
four
yesterday
as
early
as
three
i
remember
seeing
him
occasionally
some
time
ago
he
is
some
clerk
in
the
prefet
s
office
who
has
moved
to
the
why
she
exclaimed
after
glancing
down
the
street
our
gentleman
of
the
brown
coat
has
taken
to
wearing
a
wig
how
much
it
alters
him
the
gentleman
of
the
brown
coat
was
it
would
seem
the
individual
who
commonly
closed
the
daily
procession
for
the
old
woman
put
on
her
spectacles
and
took
up
her
work
with
a
sigh
glancing
at
her
daughter
with
so
strange
a
look
that
lavater
himself
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
interpret
admiration
gratitude
a
sort
of
hope
for
better
days
were
mingled
with
pride
at
having
such
a
pretty
daughter
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
the
old
lady
pushed
her
foot
against
caroline
s
and
the
girl
looked
up
quickly
enough
to
see
the
new
actor
whose
regular
advent
would
thenceforth
lend
variety
to
the
scene
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
wore
black
a
man
of
about
forty
with
a
certain
solemnity
of
demeanor
as
his
piercing
hazel
eye
met
the
old
woman
s
dull
gaze
he
made
her
quake
for
she
felt
as
though
he
had
the
gift
of
reading
hearts
or
much
practice
in
it
and
his
presence
must
surely
be
as
icy
as
the
air
of
this
dank
street
was
the
dull
sallow
complexion
of
that
ominous
face
due
to
excess
of
work
or
the
result
of
delicate
health
the
old
woman
supplied
twenty
different
answers
to
this
question
but
caroline
next
day
discerned
the
lines
of
long
mental
suffering
on
that
brow
that
was
so
prompt
to
frown
the
rather
hollow
cheeks
of
the
unknown
bore
the
stamp
of
the
seal
which
sorrow
sets
on
its
victims
as
if
to
grant
them
the
consolation
of
common
recognition
and
brotherly
union
for
resistance
though
the
girl
s
expression
was
at
first
one
of
lively
but
innocent
curiosity
it
assumed
a
look
of
gentle
sympathy
as
the
stranger
receded
from
view
like
a
last
relation
following
in
a
funeral
train
the
heat
of
the
weather
was
so
great
and
the
gentleman
was
so
that
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
forgotten
to
put
it
on
again
as
he
went
down
the
squalid
street
caroline
could
see
the
stern
look
given
to
his
countenance
by
the
way
the
hair
was
brushed
from
his
forehead
the
strong
impression
devoid
of
charm
made
on
the
girl
by
this
man
s
appearance
was
totally
unlike
any
sensation
produced
by
the
other
passengers
who
used
the
street
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
moved
to
pity
for
some
one
else
than
herself
and
her
mother
she
made
no
reply
to
the
absurd
conjectures
that
supplied
material
for
the
old
woman
s
provoking
volubility
and
drew
her
long
needle
in
silence
through
the
web
of
stretched
net
she
only
regretted
not
having
seen
the
stranger
more
closely
and
looked
forward
to
the
morrow
to
form
a
definite
opinion
of
him
it
was
the
first
time
indeed
that
a
man
passing
down
the
street
had
ever
given
rise
to
much
thought
in
her
mind
she
generally
had
nothing
but
a
smile
in
response
to
her
mother
s
hypotheses
for
the
old
woman
looked
on
every
as
a
possible
protector
for
her
daughter
and
if
such
suggestions
so
crudely
presented
gave
rise
to
no
evil
thoughts
in
caroline
s
mind
her
indifference
must
be
ascribed
to
the
persistent
and
unfortunately
inevitable
toil
in
which
the
energies
of
her
sweet
youth
were
being
spent
and
which
would
infallibly
mar
the
clearness
of
her
eyes
or
steal
from
her
fresh
cheeks
the
bloom
that
still
colored
them
for
two
months
or
more
the
black
gentleman
the
name
they
had
given
him
was
erratic
in
his
movements
he
did
not
always
come
down
the
rue
du
tourniquet
the
old
woman
sometimes
saw
him
in
the
evening
when
he
had
not
passed
in
the
morning
and
he
did
not
come
by
at
such
regular
hours
as
the
clerks
who
served
madame
crochard
instead
of
a
clock
moreover
excepting
on
the
first
occasion
when
his
look
had
given
the
old
mother
a
sense
of
alarm
his
eyes
had
never
once
dwelt
on
the
weird
picture
of
these
two
female
gnomes
with
the
exception
of
two
and
a
dark
ironmonger
s
shop
there
were
in
the
rue
du
tourniquet
only
barred
windows
giving
light
to
the
staircases
of
the
neighboring
houses
thus
the
stranger
s
lack
of
curiosity
was
not
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
presence
of
dangerous
rivals
and
madame
crochard
was
greatly
piqued
to
see
her
black
gentleman
always
lost
in
thought
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
or
straight
before
him
as
though
he
hoped
to
read
the
future
in
the
fog
of
the
rue
du
tourniquet
however
one
morning
about
the
middle
of
september
caroline
crochard
s
roguish
face
stood
out
so
brightly
against
the
dark
background
of
the
room
looking
so
fresh
among
the
belated
flowers
and
faded
leaves
that
twined
round
the
the
daily
scene
was
gay
with
such
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
of
pink
and
white
blending
with
the
light
material
on
which
the
pretty
needlewoman
was
working
and
with
the
red
and
brown
hues
of
the
chairs
that
the
stranger
gazed
very
attentively
at
the
effects
of
this
living
picture
in
point
of
fact
the
old
woman
provoked
by
her
black
gentleman
s
indifference
had
made
such
a
clatter
with
her
bobbins
that
the
gloomy
and
pensive
was
perhaps
prompted
to
look
up
by
the
unusual
noise
the
stranger
merely
exchanged
glances
with
caroline
swift
indeed
but
enough
to
effect
a
certain
contact
between
their
souls
and
both
were
aware
that
they
would
think
of
each
other
when
the
stranger
came
by
again
at
four
in
the
afternoon
caroline
recognized
the
sound
of
his
step
on
the
echoing
pavement
they
looked
steadily
at
each
other
and
with
evident
purpose
his
eyes
had
an
expression
of
kindliness
which
made
him
smile
and
caroline
colored
the
old
mother
noted
them
with
satisfaction
ever
after
that
memorable
afternoon
the
gentleman
in
black
went
by
twice
a
day
with
rare
exceptions
which
both
the
women
observed
they
concluded
from
the
irregularity
of
the
hours
of
his
homecoming
that
he
was
not
released
so
early
nor
so
precisely
punctual
as
a
subordinate
official
all
through
the
first
three
winter
months
twice
a
day
caroline
and
the
stranger
thus
saw
each
other
for
so
long
as
it
took
him
to
traverse
the
piece
of
road
that
lay
along
the
length
of
the
door
and
three
windows
of
the
house
day
after
day
this
brief
interview
had
the
hue
of
friendly
sympathy
which
at
last
had
acquired
a
sort
of
fraternal
kindness
caroline
and
the
stranger
seemed
to
understand
each
other
from
the
first
and
then
by
dint
of
scrutinizing
each
other
s
faces
they
learned
to
know
them
well
ere
long
it
came
to
be
as
it
were
a
visit
that
the
unknown
owed
to
caroline
if
by
any
chance
her
gentleman
in
black
went
by
without
bestowing
on
her
the
of
his
expressive
lips
or
the
cordial
glance
of
his
brown
eyes
something
was
missing
to
her
all
day
she
felt
as
an
old
man
does
to
whom
the
daily
study
of
a
newspaper
is
such
an
indispensable
pleasure
that
on
the
day
after
any
great
holiday
he
wanders
about
quite
lost
and
seeking
as
much
out
of
vagueness
as
for
want
of
patience
the
sheet
by
which
he
cheats
an
hour
of
life
but
these
brief
meetings
had
the
charm
of
intimate
friendliness
quite
as
much
for
the
stranger
as
for
caroline
the
girl
could
no
more
hide
a
vexation
a
grief
or
some
slight
ailment
from
the
keen
eye
of
her
appreciative
friend
than
he
could
conceal
anxiety
from
hers
he
must
have
had
some
trouble
yesterday
was
the
thought
that
constantly
arose
in
the
embroideress
mind
as
she
saw
some
change
in
the
features
of
the
black
oh
he
has
been
working
too
hard
was
a
reflection
due
to
another
shade
of
expression
which
caroline
could
discern
the
stranger
on
his
part
could
guess
when
the
girl
had
spent
sunday
in
finishing
a
dress
and
he
felt
an
interest
in
the
pattern
as
came
near
he
could
see
that
her
pretty
face
was
clouded
by
anxiety
and
he
could
guess
when
caroline
had
sat
up
late
at
work
but
above
all
he
noted
how
the
gloomy
thoughts
that
dimmed
the
cheerful
and
delicate
features
of
her
young
face
gradually
vanished
by
degrees
as
their
acquaintance
ripened
when
winter
had
killed
the
climbers
and
plants
of
her
window
garden
and
the
window
was
kept
closed
it
was
not
without
a
smile
of
gentle
amusement
that
the
stranger
observed
the
concentration
of
the
light
within
just
at
the
level
of
caroline
s
head
the
very
small
fire
and
the
frosty
red
of
the
two
women
s
faces
betrayed
the
poverty
of
their
home
but
if
ever
his
own
countenance
expressed
regretful
compassion
the
girl
proudly
met
it
with
assumed
cheerfulness
meanwhile
the
feelings
that
had
arisen
in
their
hearts
remained
buried
there
no
incident
occurring
to
reveal
to
either
of
them
how
deep
and
strong
they
were
in
the
other
they
had
never
even
heard
the
sound
of
each
other
s
voice
these
mute
friends
were
even
on
their
guard
against
any
nearer
acquaintance
as
though
it
meant
disaster
each
seemed
to
fear
lest
it
should
bring
on
the
other
some
grief
more
serious
than
those
they
felt
tempted
to
share
was
it
shyness
or
friendship
that
checked
them
was
it
a
dread
of
meeting
with
selfishness
or
the
odious
distrust
which
sunders
all
the
residents
within
the
walls
of
a
populous
city
did
the
voice
of
conscience
warn
them
of
approaching
danger
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
the
instinct
which
made
them
as
much
enemies
as
friends
at
once
indifferent
and
attached
drawn
to
each
other
by
impulse
and
severed
by
circumstance
each
perhaps
hoped
to
preserve
a
cherished
illusion
it
might
almost
have
been
thought
that
the
stranger
feared
lest
he
should
hear
some
vulgar
word
from
those
lips
as
fresh
and
pure
as
a
flower
and
that
caroline
felt
herself
unworthy
of
the
mysterious
personage
who
was
evidently
possessed
of
power
and
wealth
as
to
madame
crochard
that
tender
mother
almost
angry
at
her
daughter
s
persistent
lack
of
decisiveness
now
showed
a
sulky
face
to
the
black
gentleman
on
whom
she
had
hitherto
smiled
with
a
sort
of
benevolent
servility
never
before
had
she
complained
so
bitterly
of
being
compelled
at
her
age
to
do
the
cooking
never
had
her
catarrh
and
her
rheumatism
wrung
so
many
groans
from
her
finally
she
could
not
this
winter
promise
so
many
ells
of
net
as
caroline
had
hitherto
been
able
to
count
on
under
these
circumstances
and
towards
the
end
of
december
at
the
time
when
bread
was
dearest
and
that
dearth
of
corn
was
beginning
to
be
felt
which
made
the
year
so
hard
on
the
poor
the
stranger
observed
on
the
features
of
the
girl
whose
name
was
still
unknown
to
him
the
painful
traces
of
a
secret
sorrow
which
his
kindest
smiles
could
not
dispel
before
long
he
saw
in
caroline
s
eyes
the
dimness
attributed
to
long
hours
at
night
one
night
towards
the
end
of
the
month
the
gentleman
in
black
passed
down
the
rue
du
tourniquet
at
the
quite
unwonted
hour
of
one
in
the
morning
the
perfect
silence
allowed
of
his
hearing
before
passing
the
house
the
lachrymose
voice
of
the
old
mother
and
caroline
s
even
sadder
tones
mingling
with
the
swish
of
a
shower
of
sleet
he
crept
along
as
slowly
as
he
could
and
then
at
the
risk
of
being
taken
up
by
the
police
he
stood
still
below
the
window
to
hear
the
mother
and
daughter
while
watching
them
through
the
largest
of
the
holes
in
the
yellow
muslin
curtains
which
were
eaten
away
by
wear
as
a
cabbage
leaf
is
riddled
by
caterpillars
the
inquisitive
stranger
saw
a
sheet
of
paper
on
the
table
that
stood
between
the
two
and
on
which
stood
the
lamp
and
the
globes
filled
with
water
he
at
once
identified
it
as
a
writ
madame
crochard
was
weeping
and
caroline
s
voice
was
thick
and
had
lost
its
sweet
caressing
tone
why
be
so
heartbroken
mother
monsieur
molineux
will
not
sell
us
up
or
turn
us
out
before
i
have
finished
this
dress
only
two
nights
more
and
i
shall
take
it
home
to
madame
and
supposing
she
keeps
you
waiting
as
usual
and
will
the
money
for
the
gown
pay
the
baker
too
the
spectator
of
this
scene
had
long
practice
in
reading
faces
he
fancied
he
could
discern
that
the
mother
s
grief
was
as
false
as
the
daughter
s
was
genuine
he
turned
away
and
presently
came
back
when
he
next
peeped
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
madame
crochard
was
in
bed
the
young
needlewoman
bending
over
her
frame
was
embroidering
with
indefatigable
diligence
on
the
table
with
the
writ
lay
a
triangular
hunch
of
bread
placed
there
no
doubt
to
sustain
her
in
the
night
and
to
remind
her
of
the
reward
of
her
industry
the
stranger
was
tremulous
with
pity
and
sympathy
he
threw
his
purse
in
through
a
cracked
pane
so
that
it
should
fall
at
the
girl
s
feet
and
then
without
waiting
to
enjoy
her
surprise
he
escaped
his
cheeks
tingling
next
morning
the
shy
and
melancholy
stranger
went
past
with
a
look
of
deep
preoccupation
but
he
could
not
escape
caroline
s
gratitude
she
had
opened
her
window
and
affected
to
be
digging
in
the
square
buried
in
snow
a
pretext
of
which
the
clumsy
ingenuity
plainly
told
her
benefactor
that
she
had
been
resolved
not
to
see
him
only
through
the
pane
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
she
bowed
her
head
as
much
as
to
say
to
her
benefactor
i
can
only
repay
you
from
my
but
the
gentleman
in
black
affected
not
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
sincere
gratitude
in
the
evening
as
he
came
by
caroline
was
busy
mending
the
window
with
a
sheet
of
paper
and
she
smiled
at
him
showing
her
row
of
pearly
teeth
like
a
promise
thenceforth
the
stranger
went
another
way
and
was
no
more
seen
in
the
rue
due
tourniquet
it
was
one
day
early
in
the
following
may
that
as
caroline
was
giving
the
roots
of
the
honeysuckle
a
glass
of
water
one
saturday
morning
she
caught
sight
of
a
narrow
strip
of
cloudless
blue
between
the
black
lines
of
houses
and
said
to
her
mother
mamma
we
must
go
for
a
trip
to
montmorency
she
had
scarcely
uttered
the
words
in
a
tone
of
glee
when
the
gentleman
in
black
came
by
sadder
and
more
dejected
than
ever
caroline
s
innocent
and
ingratiating
glance
might
have
been
taken
for
an
invitation
and
in
fact
on
the
following
day
when
madame
crochard
dressed
in
a
pelisse
of
merinos
a
silk
bonnet
and
striped
shawl
of
an
imitation
indian
pattern
came
out
to
choose
seats
in
a
chaise
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
faubourg
and
the
rue
d
enghien
there
she
found
her
unknown
standing
like
a
man
waiting
for
his
wife
a
smile
of
pleasure
lighted
up
the
stranger
s
face
when
his
eye
fell
on
caroline
her
neat
feet
shod
in
prunella
gaiters
and
her
white
dress
tossed
by
a
breeze
that
would
have
been
fatal
to
an
woman
but
which
displayed
her
graceful
form
her
face
shaded
by
a
bonnet
lined
with
pink
silk
seemed
to
beam
with
a
reflection
from
heaven
her
broad
belt
set
off
a
waist
he
could
have
spanned
her
hair
parted
in
two
brown
bands
over
a
forehead
as
white
as
snow
gave
her
an
expression
of
innocence
which
no
other
feature
contradicted
enjoyment
seemed
to
have
made
caroline
as
light
as
the
straw
of
her
hat
but
when
she
saw
the
gentleman
in
black
radiant
hope
suddenly
eclipsed
her
bright
dress
and
her
beauty
the
stranger
who
appeared
to
be
in
doubt
had
not
perhaps
made
up
his
mind
to
be
the
girl
s
escort
for
the
day
till
this
revelation
of
the
delight
she
felt
on
seeing
him
he
at
once
hired
a
vehicle
with
a
fairly
good
horse
to
drive
to
and
he
offered
madame
crochard
and
her
daughter
seats
by
his
side
the
mother
accepted
without
ado
but
presently
when
they
were
already
on
the
way
to
she
was
by
way
of
having
scruples
and
made
a
few
civil
speeches
as
to
the
possible
inconvenience
two
women
might
cause
their
companion
perhaps
monsieur
you
wished
to
drive
alone
to
said
she
with
affected
simplicity
before
long
she
complained
of
the
heat
and
especially
of
her
cough
which
she
said
had
hindered
her
from
closing
her
eyes
all
night
and
by
the
time
the
carriage
had
reached
madame
crochard
seemed
to
be
fast
asleep
her
snores
indeed
seemed
to
the
gentleman
in
black
rather
doubtfully
genuine
and
he
frowned
as
he
looked
at
the
old
woman
with
a
very
suspicious
eye
oh
she
is
fast
asleep
said
caroline
quilelessly
she
never
ceased
coughing
all
night
she
must
be
very
her
companion
made
no
reply
but
he
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
say
poor
child
you
little
know
your
mother
however
in
spite
of
his
distrust
as
the
chaise
made
its
way
down
the
long
avenue
of
poplars
leading
to
eaubonne
the
stranger
thought
that
madame
crochard
was
really
asleep
perhaps
he
did
not
care
to
inquire
how
far
her
slumbers
were
genuine
or
feigned
whether
it
were
that
the
brilliant
sky
the
pure
country
air
and
the
heady
fragrance
of
the
first
green
shoots
of
the
poplars
the
catkins
of
willow
and
the
flowers
of
the
blackthorn
had
inclined
his
heart
to
open
like
all
the
nature
around
him
or
that
any
long
restraint
was
too
oppressive
while
caroline
s
sparkling
eyes
responded
to
his
own
the
gentleman
in
black
entered
on
a
conversation
with
his
young
companion
as
aimless
as
the
swaying
of
the
branches
in
the
wind
as
devious
as
the
flitting
of
the
butterflies
in
the
azure
air
as
illogical
as
the
melodious
murmur
of
the
fields
and
like
it
full
of
mysterious
love
at
that
season
is
not
the
rural
country
as
tremulous
as
a
bride
that
has
donned
her
marriage
robe
does
it
not
invite
the
coldest
soul
to
be
happy
what
heart
could
remain
unthawed
and
what
lips
could
keep
its
secret
on
leaving
the
gloomy
streets
of
the
marais
for
the
first
time
since
the
previous
autumn
and
entering
the
smiling
and
picturesque
valley
of
montmorency
on
seeing
it
in
the
morning
light
its
endless
horizons
receding
from
view
and
then
lifting
a
charmed
gaze
to
eyes
which
expressed
no
less
infinitude
mingled
with
love
the
stranger
discovered
that
caroline
was
sprightly
rather
than
witty
affectionate
but
ill
educated
but
while
her
laugh
was
giddy
her
words
promised
genuine
feeling
when
in
response
to
her
companion
s
shrewd
questioning
the
girl
spoke
with
the
heartfelt
effusiveness
of
which
the
lower
classes
are
lavish
not
guarding
it
with
reticence
like
people
of
the
world
the
black
gentleman
s
face
brightened
and
seemed
to
renew
its
youth
his
countenance
by
degrees
lost
the
sadness
that
lent
sternness
to
his
features
and
little
by
little
they
gained
a
look
of
handsome
youthfulness
which
made
caroline
proud
and
happy
the
pretty
needlewoman
guessed
that
her
new
friend
had
been
long
weaned
from
tenderness
and
love
and
no
longer
believed
in
the
devotion
of
woman
finally
some
unexpected
sally
in
caroline
s
light
prattle
lifted
the
last
veil
that
concealed
the
real
youth
and
genuine
character
of
the
stranger
s
physiognomy
he
seemed
to
bid
farewell
to
the
ideas
that
haunted
him
and
showed
the
natural
liveliness
that
lay
beneath
the
solemnity
of
his
expression
their
conversation
had
insensibly
become
so
intimate
that
by
the
time
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
first
houses
of
the
straggling
village
of
caroline
was
calling
the
gentleman
monsieur
roger
then
for
the
first
time
the
old
mother
awoke
caroline
she
has
heard
everything
said
roger
suspiciously
in
the
girl
s
ear
caroline
s
reply
was
an
exquisite
smile
of
disbelief
which
dissipated
the
dark
cloud
that
his
fear
of
some
plot
on
the
old
woman
s
part
had
brought
to
this
suspicious
mortal
s
brow
madame
crochard
was
amazed
at
nothing
approved
of
everything
followed
her
daughter
and
monsieur
roger
into
the
park
where
the
two
young
people
had
agreed
to
wander
through
the
smiling
meadows
and
fragrant
copses
made
famous
by
the
taste
of
queen
hortense
good
heavens
how
lovely
exclaimed
caroline
when
standing
on
the
green
ridge
where
the
forest
of
montmorency
begins
she
saw
lying
at
her
feet
the
wide
valley
with
its
combes
sheltering
scattered
villages
its
horizon
of
blue
hills
its
church
towers
its
meadows
and
fields
whence
a
murmur
came
up
to
die
on
her
ear
like
the
swell
of
the
ocean
the
three
wanderers
made
their
way
by
the
bank
of
an
artificial
stream
and
came
to
the
swiss
valley
where
stands
a
chalet
that
had
more
than
once
given
shelter
to
hortense
and
napoleon
when
caroline
had
seated
herself
with
pious
reverence
on
the
mossy
wooden
bench
where
kings
and
princesses
and
the
emperor
had
rested
madame
crochard
expressed
a
wish
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
a
bridge
that
hung
across
between
two
rocks
at
some
little
distance
and
bent
her
steps
towards
that
rural
curiosity
leaving
her
daughter
in
monsieur
roger
s
care
though
telling
them
that
she
would
not
go
out
of
sight
what
poor
child
cried
roger
have
you
never
longed
for
wealth
and
the
pleasures
of
luxury
have
you
never
wished
that
you
might
wear
the
beautiful
dresses
you
embroider
it
would
not
be
the
truth
monsieur
roger
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
never
think
how
happy
people
must
be
who
are
rich
oh
yes
i
often
fancy
especially
when
i
am
going
to
sleep
how
glad
i
should
be
to
see
my
poor
mother
no
longer
compelled
to
go
out
whatever
the
weather
to
buy
our
little
provisions
at
her
age
i
should
like
her
to
have
a
servant
who
every
morning
before
she
was
up
would
bring
her
up
her
coffee
nicely
sweetened
with
white
sugar
and
she
loves
reading
novels
poor
dear
soul
well
and
i
would
rather
see
her
wearing
out
her
eyes
over
her
favorite
books
than
over
twisting
her
bobbins
from
morning
till
night
and
again
she
ought
to
have
a
little
good
wine
in
short
i
should
like
to
see
her
comfortable
she
is
so
then
she
has
shown
you
great
kindness
oh
yes
said
the
girl
in
a
tone
of
conviction
then
after
a
short
pause
during
which
the
two
young
people
stood
watching
madame
crochard
who
had
got
to
the
middle
of
the
rustic
bridge
and
was
shaking
her
finger
at
them
caroline
went
on
oh
yes
she
has
been
so
good
to
me
what
care
she
took
of
me
when
i
was
little
she
sold
her
last
silver
forks
to
apprentice
me
to
the
old
maid
who
taught
me
to
and
my
poor
father
what
did
she
not
go
through
to
make
him
end
his
days
in
happiness
the
girl
shivered
at
the
remembrance
and
hid
her
face
in
her
well
come
let
us
forget
past
sorrows
she
added
trying
to
rally
her
high
spirits
she
blushed
as
she
saw
that
roger
too
was
moved
but
she
dared
not
look
at
him
what
was
your
father
he
asked
he
was
an
before
the
revolution
said
she
with
an
air
of
perfect
simplicity
and
my
mother
sang
in
the
chorus
my
father
who
was
leader
of
the
figures
on
the
stage
happened
to
be
present
at
the
siege
of
the
bastille
he
was
recognized
by
some
of
the
assailants
who
asked
him
whether
he
could
not
lead
a
real
attack
since
he
was
used
to
leading
such
enterprises
on
the
boards
my
father
was
brave
he
accepted
the
post
led
the
insurgents
and
was
rewarded
by
the
nomination
to
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
army
of
where
he
distinguished
himself
so
far
as
to
rise
rapidly
to
be
a
colonel
but
at
lutzen
he
was
so
badly
wounded
that
after
a
year
s
sufferings
he
died
in
the
bourbons
returned
my
mother
could
obtain
no
pension
and
we
fell
into
such
abject
misery
that
we
were
compelled
to
work
for
our
living
for
some
time
past
she
has
been
ailing
poor
dear
and
i
have
never
known
her
so
little
resigned
she
complains
a
good
deal
and
indeed
i
can
not
wonder
for
she
has
known
the
pleasures
of
an
easy
life
for
my
part
i
can
not
pine
for
delights
i
have
never
known
i
have
but
one
thing
to
wish
and
that
is
said
roger
eagerly
as
if
roused
from
a
dream
that
women
may
continue
to
wear
embroidered
net
dresses
so
that
i
may
never
lack
the
frankness
of
this
confession
interested
the
young
man
who
looked
with
less
hostile
eyes
on
madame
crochard
as
she
slowly
made
her
way
back
to
them
well
children
have
you
had
a
long
talk
said
she
with
a
air
when
i
think
monsieur
roger
that
the
little
corporal
has
sat
where
you
are
sitting
she
went
on
after
a
pause
poor
man
how
my
husband
worshiped
him
ah
crochard
did
well
to
die
for
he
could
not
have
borne
to
think
of
him
where
have
sent
him
roger
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
and
the
good
woman
went
on
very
gravely
with
a
shake
of
her
head
all
right
mouth
shut
and
tongue
still
but
added
she
unhooking
a
bit
of
her
bodice
and
showing
a
ribbon
and
cross
tied
round
her
neck
by
a
piece
of
black
ribbon
they
shall
never
hinder
me
from
wearing
what
gave
to
my
poor
crochard
and
i
will
have
it
buried
with
on
hearing
this
speech
which
at
that
time
was
regarded
as
seditious
roger
interrupted
the
old
lady
by
rising
suddenly
and
they
returned
to
the
village
through
the
park
walks
the
young
man
left
them
for
a
few
minutes
while
he
went
to
order
a
meal
at
the
best
in
taverny
then
returning
to
fetch
them
he
led
the
way
through
the
alleys
cut
in
the
forest
the
dinner
was
cheerful
roger
was
no
longer
the
melancholy
shade
that
was
wont
to
pass
along
the
rue
du
tourniquet
he
was
not
the
black
gentleman
but
rather
a
confiding
young
man
ready
to
take
life
as
it
came
like
the
two
women
who
on
the
morrow
might
lack
bread
he
seemed
alive
to
all
the
joys
of
youth
his
smile
was
quite
affectionate
and
childlike
when
at
five
o
clock
this
happy
meal
was
ended
with
a
few
glasses
of
champagne
roger
was
the
first
to
propose
that
they
should
join
the
village
ball
under
the
chestnuts
where
he
and
caroline
danced
together
their
hands
met
with
sympathetic
pressure
their
hearts
beat
with
the
same
hopes
and
under
the
blue
sky
and
the
slanting
rosy
beams
of
sunset
their
eyes
sparkled
with
fires
which
to
them
made
the
glory
of
the
heavens
pale
how
strange
is
the
power
of
an
idea
of
a
desire
to
these
two
nothing
seemed
impossible
in
such
magic
moments
when
enjoyment
sheds
its
reflections
on
the
future
the
soul
foresees
nothing
but
happiness
this
sweet
day
had
created
memories
for
these
two
to
which
nothing
could
be
compared
in
all
their
past
existence
would
the
source
prove
to
be
more
beautiful
than
the
river
the
desire
more
enchanting
than
its
gratification
the
thing
hoped
for
more
delightful
than
the
thing
possessed
so
the
day
is
already
at
an
end
on
hearing
this
exclamation
from
her
unknown
friend
when
the
dance
was
over
caroline
looked
at
him
compassionately
as
his
face
assumed
once
more
a
faint
shade
of
sadness
why
should
you
not
be
as
happy
in
paris
as
you
are
here
she
asked
is
happiness
to
be
found
only
at
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
henceforth
never
be
unhappy
roger
was
struck
by
these
words
spoken
with
the
glad
unrestraint
that
always
carries
a
woman
further
than
she
intended
just
as
prudery
often
lends
her
greater
cruelty
than
she
feels
for
the
first
time
since
that
glance
which
had
in
a
way
been
the
beginning
of
their
friendship
caroline
and
roger
had
the
same
idea
though
they
did
not
express
it
they
felt
it
at
the
same
instant
as
a
result
of
a
common
impression
like
that
of
a
comforting
fire
cheering
both
under
the
frost
of
winter
then
as
if
frightened
by
each
other
s
silence
they
made
their
way
to
the
spot
where
the
carriage
was
waiting
but
before
getting
into
it
they
playfully
took
hands
and
ran
together
down
the
dark
avenue
in
front
of
madame
crochard
when
they
could
no
longer
see
the
white
net
cap
which
showed
as
a
speck
through
the
leaves
where
the
old
woman
was
caroline
said
roger
in
a
tremulous
voice
and
with
a
beating
heart
the
girl
was
startled
and
drew
back
a
few
steps
understanding
the
invitation
this
question
conveyed
however
she
held
out
her
hand
which
was
passionately
kissed
but
which
she
hastily
withdrew
for
by
standing
on
tiptoe
she
could
see
her
mother
madame
crochard
affected
blindness
as
if
with
a
reminiscence
of
her
old
parts
she
was
only
required
to
figure
as
a
supernumerary
the
adventures
of
these
two
young
people
were
not
continued
in
the
rue
du
tourniquet
to
see
roger
and
caroline
once
more
we
must
leap
into
the
heart
of
modern
paris
where
in
some
of
the
houses
there
are
apartments
that
seem
made
on
purpose
for
couples
to
spend
their
honeymoon
in
there
the
paper
and
paint
are
as
fresh
as
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
the
decorations
are
in
blossom
like
their
love
everything
is
in
harmony
with
youthful
notions
and
ardent
wishes
down
the
rue
taitbout
in
a
house
whose
stone
walls
were
still
white
where
the
columns
of
the
hall
and
the
doorway
were
as
yet
spotless
and
the
inner
walls
shone
with
the
neat
painting
which
our
recent
intimacy
with
english
ways
had
brought
into
fashion
there
was
on
the
second
floor
a
small
set
of
rooms
fitted
by
the
architect
as
though
he
had
known
what
their
use
would
be
a
simple
airy
with
a
stucco
dado
formed
an
entrance
into
a
and
out
of
the
opened
a
pretty
bedroom
with
a
bathroom
beyond
every
had
over
it
a
fine
mirror
elegantly
framed
the
doors
were
crowded
with
arabesques
in
good
taste
and
the
cornices
were
in
the
best
style
any
amateur
would
have
discerned
there
the
sense
of
distinction
and
decorative
fitness
which
mark
the
work
of
modern
french
architects
for
above
a
month
caroline
had
been
at
home
in
this
apartment
furnished
by
an
upholsterer
who
submitted
to
an
artist
s
guidance
a
short
description
of
the
principal
room
will
suffice
to
give
us
an
idea
of
the
wonders
it
offered
to
caroline
s
delighted
eyes
when
roger
installed
her
there
hangings
of
gray
stuff
trimmed
with
green
silk
adorned
the
walls
of
her
bedroom
the
seats
covered
with
woolen
sateen
were
of
easy
and
comfortable
shapes
and
in
the
latest
fashion
a
chest
of
drawers
of
some
simple
wood
inlaid
with
lines
of
a
darker
hue
contained
the
treasures
of
the
toilet
a
to
match
served
for
inditing
on
scented
paper
the
bed
with
antique
draperies
could
not
fail
to
suggest
thoughts
of
love
by
its
soft
hangings
of
elegant
muslin
the
of
drab
silk
with
green
fringe
were
always
half
drawn
to
subdue
the
light
a
bronze
clock
represented
love
crowning
psyche
and
a
carpet
of
gothic
design
on
a
red
ground
set
off
the
other
accessories
of
this
delightful
retreat
there
was
a
small
in
front
of
a
long
glass
and
here
the
needlewoman
sat
out
of
patience
with
plaisir
the
famous
hairdresser
do
you
think
you
will
have
done
said
she
your
hair
is
so
long
and
so
thick
madame
replied
plaisir
caroline
could
not
help
smiling
the
man
s
flattery
had
no
doubt
revived
in
her
mind
the
memory
of
the
passionate
praises
lavished
by
her
lover
on
the
beauty
of
her
hair
which
he
delighted
in
the
hairdresser
having
done
a
came
and
held
counsel
with
her
as
to
the
dress
in
which
roger
would
like
best
to
see
her
it
was
the
beginning
of
september
and
the
weather
was
cold
she
chose
a
green
trimmed
with
chinchilla
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
caroline
flew
into
the
and
opened
a
window
out
of
which
she
stepped
on
to
the
elegant
balcony
that
adorned
the
front
of
the
house
there
she
stood
with
her
arms
crossed
in
a
charming
attitude
not
to
show
herself
to
the
admiration
of
the
and
see
them
turn
to
gaze
at
her
but
to
be
able
to
look
out
on
the
boulevard
at
the
bottom
of
the
rue
taitbout
this
side
view
really
very
comparable
to
the
peephole
made
by
actors
in
the
of
a
theatre
enabled
her
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
numbers
of
elegant
carriages
and
a
crowd
of
persons
swept
past
with
the
rapidity
of
not
knowing
whether
roger
would
arrive
in
a
carriage
or
on
foot
the
needlewoman
from
the
rue
du
tourniquet
looked
by
turns
at
the
and
at
the
tilburies
light
cabs
introduced
into
paris
by
the
english
expressions
of
refractoriness
and
of
love
passed
by
turns
over
her
youthful
face
when
after
waiting
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
neither
her
keen
eye
nor
her
heart
had
announced
the
arrival
of
him
whom
she
knew
to
be
due
what
disdain
what
indifference
were
shown
in
her
beautiful
features
for
all
the
other
creatures
who
were
bustling
like
ants
below
her
feet
her
gray
eyes
sparkling
with
fun
now
positively
flamed
given
over
to
her
passion
she
avoided
admiration
with
as
much
care
as
the
proudest
devote
to
encouraging
it
when
they
drive
about
paris
certainly
feeling
no
care
as
to
whether
her
fair
countenance
leaning
over
the
balcony
or
her
little
foot
between
the
bars
and
the
picture
of
her
bright
eyes
and
delicious
nose
would
be
effaced
or
no
from
the
minds
of
the
who
admired
them
she
saw
but
one
face
and
had
but
one
idea
when
the
spotted
head
of
a
certain
bay
horse
happened
to
cross
the
narrow
strip
between
the
two
rows
of
houses
caroline
gave
a
little
shiver
and
stood
on
tiptoe
in
hope
of
recognizing
the
white
traces
and
the
color
of
the
tilbury
it
was
he
roger
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
saw
the
balcony
whipped
the
horse
which
came
up
at
a
gallop
and
stopped
at
the
door
that
he
knew
as
well
as
his
master
did
the
door
of
the
apartment
was
opened
at
once
by
the
maid
who
had
heard
her
mistress
exclamation
of
delight
roger
rushed
up
to
the
clasped
caroline
in
his
arms
and
embraced
her
with
the
effusive
feeling
natural
when
two
beings
who
love
each
other
rarely
meet
he
led
her
or
rather
they
went
by
a
common
impulse
their
arms
about
each
other
into
the
quiet
and
fragrant
bedroom
a
settee
stood
ready
for
them
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
expressing
their
happiness
only
by
their
clasped
hands
and
communicating
their
thoughts
in
a
fond
gaze
yes
it
is
he
she
said
at
last
yes
it
is
you
do
you
know
i
have
not
seen
you
for
three
long
days
an
age
but
what
is
the
matter
you
are
my
poor
caroline
there
you
see
poor
caroline
no
no
do
not
laugh
my
darling
we
can
not
go
to
the
feydeau
theatre
together
this
caroline
put
on
a
little
pout
but
it
vanished
immediately
how
absurd
i
am
how
can
i
think
of
going
to
the
play
when
i
see
you
is
not
the
sight
of
you
the
only
spectacle
i
care
for
she
cried
pushing
her
fingers
through
roger
s
hair
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
the
s
we
have
a
knotty
case
in
hand
he
met
me
in
the
great
hall
at
the
palais
and
as
i
am
to
plead
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
but
my
dearest

can
go
to
the
theatre
with
your
mother
and
i
will
join
you
if
the
meeting
breaks
up
to
the
theatre
without
you
cried
she
in
a
tone
of
amazement

any
pleasure
you
do
not
share
o
my
roger
you
do
not
deserve
a
kiss
she
added
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
with
an
artless
and
impassioned
impulse
caroline
i
must
go
home
and
dress
the
marais
is
some
way
off
and
i
still
have
some
business
to
take
care
what
you
are
saying
monsieur
said
she
interrupting
him
my
mother
says
that
when
a
man
begins
to
talk
about
his
business
he
is
ceasing
to
caroline
am
i
not
here
have
i
not
stolen
this
hour
from
my
pitiless
hush
said
she
laying
a
finger
on
his
mouth
don
t
you
see
that
i
am
in
they
had
now
come
back
to
the
and
roger
s
eye
fell
on
an
object
brought
home
that
morning
by
the
cabinetmaker
caroline
s
old
rosewood
by
which
she
and
her
mother
had
earned
their
bread
when
they
lived
in
the
rue
du
had
been
refitted
and
polished
and
a
net
dress
of
elaborate
design
was
already
stretched
upon
it
well
then
my
dear
i
shall
do
some
work
this
evening
as
i
stitch
i
shall
fancy
myself
gone
back
to
those
early
days
when
you
used
to
pass
by
me
without
a
word
but
not
without
a
glance
the
days
when
the
remembrance
of
your
look
kept
me
awake
all
night
oh
my
dear
old
frame
the
best
piece
of
furniture
in
my
room
though
you
did
not
give
it
me
you
can
not
think
said
she
seating
herself
on
roger
s
knees
for
he
overcome
by
irresistible
feelings
had
dropped
into
a
chair
all
i
can
earn
by
my
work
i
mean
to
give
to
the
poor
you
have
made
me
rich
how
i
love
that
pretty
home
at
bellefeuille
less
because
of
what
it
is
than
because
you
gave
it
me
but
tell
me
roger
i
should
like
to
call
myself
caroline
de
bellefeuille
can
i
you
must
know
is
it
legal
or
permissible
as
she
saw
a
little
affirmative
grimace
for
roger
hated
the
name
of
crochard
caroline
jumped
for
glee
and
clapped
her
hands
i
feel
said
she
as
if
i
should
more
especially
belong
to
you
usually
a
woman
gives
up
her
own
name
and
takes
her
husband
s
an
idea
forced
itself
upon
her
and
made
her
blush
she
took
roger
s
hand
and
led
him
to
the
open
listen
said
she
i
can
play
my
sonata
now
like
an
angel
and
her
fingers
were
already
running
over
the
ivory
keys
when
she
felt
herself
seized
round
the
waist
caroline
i
ought
to
be
far
from
hence
you
insist
on
going
well
go
said
she
with
a
pretty
pout
but
she
smiled
as
she
looked
at
the
clock
and
exclaimed
joyfully
at
any
rate
i
have
detained
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
said
he
with
the
gentle
irony
of
love
she
kissed
him
and
saw
her
lover
to
the
door
when
the
sound
of
his
steps
had
died
away
on
the
stairs
she
ran
out
on
to
the
balcony
to
see
him
get
into
the
tilbury
to
see
him
gather
up
the
reins
to
catch
a
parting
look
hear
the
crack
of
his
whip
and
the
sound
of
his
wheels
on
the
stones
watch
the
handsome
horse
the
master
s
hat
the
tiger
s
gold
lace
and
at
last
to
stand
gazing
long
after
the
dark
corner
of
the
street
had
eclipsed
this
vision
five
years
after
mademoiselle
caroline
de
bellefeuille
had
taken
up
her
abode
in
the
pretty
house
in
the
rue
taitbout
we
again
look
in
on
one
of
those
which
tighten
the
bonds
of
affection
between
two
persons
who
truly
love
in
the
middle
of
the
blue
in
front
of
the
window
opening
to
the
balcony
a
little
boy
of
four
was
making
a
tremendous
noise
as
he
whipped
the
whose
two
curved
supports
for
the
legs
did
not
move
fast
enough
to
please
him
his
pretty
face
framed
in
fair
curls
that
fell
over
his
white
collar
smiled
up
like
a
cherub
s
at
his
mother
when
she
said
to
him
from
the
depths
of
an
not
so
much
noise
charles
you
will
wake
your
little
the
inquisitive
boy
suddenly
got
off
his
horse
and
treading
on
tiptoe
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
the
sound
of
his
feet
on
the
carpet
came
up
with
one
finger
between
his
little
teeth
and
standing
in
one
of
those
childish
attitudes
that
are
so
graceful
because
they
are
so
perfectly
natural
raised
the
muslin
veil
that
hid
the
rosy
face
of
a
little
girl
sleeping
on
her
mother
s
knee
is
eugenie
asleep
then
said
he
quite
astonished
why
is
she
asleep
when
we
are
awake
he
added
looking
up
with
large
liquid
black
eyes
that
only
god
can
know
replied
caroline
with
a
smile
the
mother
and
boy
gazed
at
the
infant
only
that
morning
baptized
caroline
now
about
showed
the
ripe
beauty
which
had
expanded
under
the
influence
of
cloudless
happiness
and
constant
enjoyment
in
her
the
woman
was
complete
delighted
to
obey
her
dear
roger
s
every
wish
she
had
acquired
the
accomplishments
she
had
lacked
she
played
the
piano
fairly
well
and
sang
sweetly
ignorant
of
the
customs
of
a
world
that
would
have
treated
her
as
an
outcast
and
which
she
would
not
have
cared
for
even
if
it
had
welcomed
her
for
a
happy
woman
does
not
care
for
the
world
she
had
not
caught
the
elegance
of
manner
or
learned
the
art
of
conversation
abounding
in
words
and
devoid
of
ideas
which
is
current
in
fashionable
on
the
other
hand
she
worked
hard
to
gain
the
knowledge
indispensable
to
a
mother
whose
chief
ambition
is
to
bring
up
her
children
well
never
to
lose
sight
of
her
boy
to
give
him
from
the
cradle
that
training
of
every
minute
which
impresses
on
the
young
a
love
of
all
that
is
good
and
beautiful
to
shelter
him
from
every
evil
influence
and
fulfil
both
the
painful
duties
of
a
nurse
and
the
tender
offices
of
a
mother
these
were
her
chief
pleasures
the
coy
and
gentle
being
had
from
the
first
day
so
fully
resigned
herself
never
to
step
beyond
the
enchanted
sphere
where
she
found
all
her
happiness
that
after
six
years
of
the
tenderest
intimacy
she
still
knew
her
lover
only
by
the
name
of
roger
a
print
of
the
picture
of
the
psyche
lighting
her
lamp
to
gaze
on
love
in
spite
of
his
prohibition
hung
in
her
room
and
constantly
reminded
her
of
the
conditions
of
her
happiness
through
all
these
six
years
her
humble
pleasures
had
never
importuned
roger
by
a
single
indiscreet
ambition
and
his
heart
was
a
of
kindness
never
had
she
longed
for
diamonds
or
fine
clothes
and
had
again
and
again
refused
the
luxury
of
a
carriage
which
he
had
offered
her
to
look
out
from
her
balcony
for
roger
s
cab
to
go
with
him
to
the
play
or
make
excursions
with
him
on
fine
days
in
the
environs
of
paris
to
long
for
him
to
see
him
and
then
to
long
again
these
made
up
the
history
of
her
life
poor
in
incidents
but
rich
in
happiness
as
she
rocked
the
infant
now
a
few
months
old
on
her
knee
singing
the
while
she
allowed
herself
to
recall
the
memories
of
the
past
she
lingered
more
especially
on
the
months
of
september
when
roger
was
accustomed
to
take
her
to
bellefeuille
and
spend
the
delightful
days
which
seem
to
combine
the
charms
of
every
season
nature
is
equally
prodigal
of
flowers
and
fruit
the
evenings
are
mild
the
mornings
bright
and
a
blaze
of
summer
often
returns
after
a
spell
of
autumn
gloom
during
the
early
days
of
their
love
caroline
had
ascribed
the
even
mind
and
gentle
temper
of
which
roger
gave
her
so
many
proofs
to
the
rarity
of
their
always
meetings
and
to
their
mode
of
life
which
did
not
compel
them
to
be
constantly
together
as
a
husband
and
wife
must
be
but
now
she
could
remember
with
rapture
that
tortured
by
foolish
fears
she
had
watched
him
with
trembling
during
their
first
stay
on
this
little
estate
in
the
gatinais
vain
suspiciousness
of
love
each
of
these
months
of
happiness
had
passed
like
a
dream
in
the
midst
of
joys
which
never
rang
false
she
had
always
seen
that
kind
creature
with
a
tender
smile
on
his
lips
a
smile
that
seemed
to
mirror
her
own
as
she
called
up
these
vivid
pictures
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
thought
she
could
not
love
him
enough
and
was
tempted
to
regard
her
ambiguous
position
as
a
sort
of
tax
levied
by
fate
on
her
love
finally
invincible
curiosity
led
her
to
wonder
for
the
thousandth
time
what
events
they
could
be
that
led
so
tender
a
heart
as
roger
s
to
find
his
pleasure
in
clandestine
and
illicit
happiness
she
invented
a
thousand
romances
on
purpose
really
to
avoid
recognizing
the
true
reason
which
she
had
long
suspected
but
tried
not
to
believe
in
she
rose
and
carrying
the
baby
in
her
arms
went
into
the
to
superintend
the
preparations
for
dinner
it
was
the
of
may
the
anniversary
of
the
excursion
to
the
park
of
which
had
been
the
of
her
life
each
year
it
had
been
marked
by
heartfelt
rejoicing
caroline
chose
the
linen
to
be
used
and
arranged
the
dessert
having
attended
with
joy
to
these
details
which
touched
roger
she
placed
the
infant
in
her
pretty
cot
and
went
out
on
to
the
balcony
whence
she
presently
saw
the
carriage
which
her
friend
as
he
grew
to
riper
years
now
used
instead
of
the
smart
tilbury
of
his
youth
after
submitting
to
the
first
fire
of
caroline
s
embraces
and
the
kisses
of
the
little
rogue
who
addressed
him
as
papa
roger
went
to
the
cradle
looked
at
his
little
sleeping
daughter
kissed
her
forehead
and
then
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
document
covered
with
black
writing
caroline
said
he
here
is
the
marriage
portion
of
mademoiselle
eugenie
de
the
mother
gratefully
took
the
paper
a
deed
of
gift
of
securities
in
the
state
funds
buy
why
said
she
have
you
given
eugenie
three
thousand
francs
a
year
and
charles
no
more
than
fifteen
hundred
charles
my
love
will
be
a
man
replied
he
fifteen
hundred
francs
are
enough
for
him
with
so
much
for
certain
a
man
of
courage
is
above
poverty
and
if
by
chance
your
son
should
turn
out
a
nonentity
i
do
not
wish
him
to
be
able
to
play
the
fool
if
he
is
ambitious
this
small
income
will
give
him
a
taste
for
eugenie
is
a
girl
she
must
have
a
little
the
father
then
turned
to
play
with
his
boy
whose
effusive
affection
showed
the
independence
and
freedom
in
which
he
was
brought
up
no
sort
of
shyness
between
the
father
and
child
interfered
with
the
charm
which
rewards
a
parent
for
his
devotion
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
little
family
was
as
sweet
as
it
was
genuine
in
the
evening
a
displayed
its
illusions
and
mysterious
pictures
on
a
white
sheet
to
charles
great
surprise
and
more
than
once
the
innocent
child
s
heavenly
rapture
made
caroline
and
roger
laugh
heartily
later
when
the
little
boy
was
in
bed
the
baby
woke
and
craved
its
limpid
nourishment
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
in
the
chimney
corner
roger
enjoyed
the
scene
of
peace
and
comfort
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
happiness
of
contemplating
the
sweet
picture
of
the
child
clinging
to
caroline
s
white
bosom
as
she
sat
as
fresh
as
a
newly
opened
lily
while
her
hair
fell
in
long
brown
curls
that
almost
hid
her
neck
the
lamplight
enhanced
the
grace
of
the
young
mother
shedding
over
her
her
dress
and
the
infant
the
picturesque
effects
of
strong
light
and
shadow
the
calm
and
silent
woman
s
face
struck
roger
as
a
thousand
times
sweeter
than
ever
and
he
gazed
tenderly
at
the
rosy
pouting
lips
from
which
no
harsh
word
had
ever
been
heard
the
very
same
thought
was
legible
in
caroline
s
eyes
as
she
gave
a
sidelong
look
at
roger
either
to
enjoy
the
effect
she
was
producing
on
him
or
to
see
what
the
end
of
the
evening
was
to
be
he
understanding
the
meaning
of
this
cunning
glance
said
with
assumed
regret
i
must
be
going
i
have
a
serious
case
to
be
finished
and
i
am
expected
at
home
duty
before
all
things
don
t
you
think
so
my
darling
caroline
looked
him
in
the
face
with
an
expression
at
once
sad
and
sweet
with
the
resignation
which
does
not
however
disguise
the
pangs
of
a
sacrifice
then
said
she
go
for
if
you
stay
an
hour
longer
i
can
not
so
lightly
bear
to
set
you
my
dearest
said
he
with
a
smile
i
have
three
days
holiday
and
am
supposed
to
be
twenty
leagues
away
from
a
few
days
after
this
anniversary
of
the
of
may
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
hurried
off
one
morning
to
the
rue
in
the
marais
only
hoping
she
might
not
arrive
too
late
at
a
house
where
she
commonly
went
once
a
week
an
express
messenger
had
just
come
to
inform
her
that
her
mother
madame
crochard
was
sinking
under
a
complication
of
disorders
produced
by
constant
catarrh
and
rheumatism
while
the
hackney
was
flogging
up
his
horses
at
caroline
s
urgent
request
supported
by
the
promise
of
a
handsome
present
the
timid
old
women
who
had
been
madame
crochard
s
friends
during
her
later
years
had
brought
a
priest
into
the
neat
and
comfortable
rooms
occupied
by
the
old
widow
madame
crochard
s
maid
did
not
know
that
the
pretty
lady
at
whose
house
her
mistress
so
often
dined
was
her
daughter
and
she
was
one
of
the
first
to
suggest
the
services
of
a
confessor
in
the
hope
that
this
priest
might
be
at
least
as
useful
to
herself
as
to
the
sick
woman
between
two
games
of
boston
or
out
walking
in
the
jardin
turc
the
old
beldames
with
whom
the
widow
gossiped
all
day
had
succeeded
in
rousing
in
their
friend
s
stony
heart
some
scruples
as
to
her
former
life
some
visions
of
the
future
some
fears
of
hell
and
some
hopes
of
forgiveness
if
she
should
return
in
sincerity
to
a
religious
life
so
on
this
solemn
morning
three
ancient
females
had
settled
themselves
in
the
where
madame
crochard
was
at
home
every
tuesday
each
in
turn
left
her
armchair
to
go
to
the
poor
old
woman
s
bedside
and
sit
with
her
giving
her
the
false
hopes
with
which
people
delude
the
dying
at
the
same
time
when
the
end
was
drawing
near
when
the
physician
called
in
the
day
before
would
no
longer
answer
for
her
life
the
three
dames
took
counsel
together
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
well
to
send
word
to
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
francoise
having
been
duly
informed
it
was
decided
that
a
commissionaire
should
go
to
the
rue
taitbout
to
inform
the
young
relation
whose
influence
was
so
disquieting
to
the
four
women
still
they
hoped
that
the
auvergnat
would
be
too
late
in
bringing
back
the
person
who
so
certainly
held
the
first
place
in
the
widow
crochard
s
affections
the
widow
evidently
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
thousand
crowns
a
year
would
not
have
been
so
fondly
cherished
by
this
feminine
trio
but
that
neither
of
them
nor
francoise
herself
knew
of
her
having
any
heir
the
wealth
enjoyed
by
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
whom
madame
crochard
in
obedience
to
the
traditions
of
the
older
opera
never
allowed
herself
to
speak
of
by
the
affectionate
name
of
daughter
almost
justified
the
four
women
in
their
scheme
of
dividing
among
themselves
the
old
woman
s
presently
the
one
of
these
three
sibyls
who
kept
guard
over
the
sick
woman
came
shaking
her
head
at
the
other
anxious
two
and
said
it
is
time
we
should
be
sending
for
the
abbe
fontanon
in
another
two
hours
she
will
neither
have
the
wit
nor
the
strength
to
write
a
thereupon
the
toothless
old
cook
went
off
and
returned
with
a
man
wearing
a
black
gown
a
low
forehead
showed
a
small
mind
in
this
priest
whose
features
were
mean
his
flabby
fat
cheeks
and
double
chin
betrayed
the
egotist
his
powdered
hair
gave
him
a
pleasant
look
till
he
raised
his
small
brown
eyes
prominent
under
a
flat
forehead
and
not
unworthy
to
glitter
under
the
brows
of
a
tartar
monsieur
l
abbe
said
francoise
i
thank
you
for
all
your
advice
but
believe
me
i
have
taken
the
greatest
care
of
the
dear
but
the
servant
with
her
dragging
step
and
look
was
silent
when
she
saw
that
the
door
of
the
apartment
was
open
and
that
the
most
insinuating
of
the
three
dowagers
was
standing
on
the
landing
to
be
the
first
to
speak
with
the
confessor
when
the
priest
had
politely
faced
the
honeyed
and
bigoted
broadside
of
words
fired
off
from
the
widow
s
three
friends
he
went
into
the
sickroom
to
sit
by
madame
crochard
decency
and
some
sense
of
reserve
compelled
the
three
women
and
old
francoise
to
remain
in
the
and
to
make
such
grimaces
of
grief
as
are
possible
in
perfection
only
to
such
wrinkled
faces
oh
is
it
not
cried
francoise
heaving
a
sigh
this
is
the
fourth
mistress
i
have
buried
the
first
left
me
a
hundred
francs
a
year
the
second
a
sum
of
fifty
crowns
and
the
third
a
thousand
crowns
down
after
thirty
years
service
that
is
all
i
have
to
call
my
the
woman
took
advantage
of
her
freedom
to
come
and
go
to
slip
into
a
cupboard
whence
she
could
hear
the
priest
i
see
with
pleasure
daughter
said
fontanon
that
you
have
pious
sentiments
you
have
a
sacred
relic
round
your
madame
crochard
with
a
feeble
vagueness
which
seemed
to
show
that
she
had
not
all
her
wits
about
her
pulled
out
the
imperial
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
priest
started
back
at
seeing
the
emperor
s
head
he
went
up
to
the
penitent
again
and
she
spoke
to
him
but
in
such
a
low
tone
that
for
some
minutes
francoise
could
hear
nothing
woe
upon
me
cried
the
old
woman
suddenly
do
not
desert
me
what
monsieur
l
abbe
do
you
think
i
shall
be
called
to
account
for
my
daughter
s
soul
the
abbe
spoke
too
low
and
the
partition
was
too
thick
for
francoise
to
hear
the
reply
alas
sobbed
the
woman
the
wretch
has
left
me
nothing
that
i
can
bequeath
when
he
robbed
me
of
my
dear
caroline
he
parted
us
and
only
allowed
me
three
thousand
francs
a
year
of
which
the
capital
belongs
to
my
madame
has
a
daughter
and
nothing
to
live
on
but
an
annuity
shrieked
francoise
bursting
into
the
the
three
old
crones
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
one
of
them
whose
nose
and
chin
nearly
met
with
an
expression
that
betrayed
a
superior
type
of
hypocrisy
and
cunning
winked
her
eyes
and
as
soon
as
francoise
s
back
was
turned
she
gave
her
friends
a
nod
as
much
as
to
say
that
slut
is
too
knowing
by
half
her
name
has
figured
in
three
wills
so
the
three
old
dames
sat
on
however
the
abbe
presently
came
out
and
at
a
word
from
him
the
witches
scuttered
down
the
stairs
at
his
heels
leaving
francoise
alone
with
her
mistress
madame
crochard
whose
sufferings
increased
in
severity
rang
but
in
vain
for
this
woman
who
only
called
out
coming
coming
in
a
minute
the
doors
of
cupboards
and
wardrobes
were
slamming
as
though
francoise
were
hunting
high
and
low
for
a
lost
lottery
ticket
just
as
this
crisis
was
at
a
climax
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
came
to
stand
by
her
mother
s
bed
lavishing
tender
words
on
her
oh
my
dear
mother
how
criminal
i
have
been
you
are
ill
and
i
did
not
know
it
my
heart
did
not
warn
me
however
here
i
am
caroline
what
is
it
they
fetched
a
priest
but
send
for
a
doctor
bless
me
cried
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
francoise
a
doctor
how
is
it
that
these
ladies
never
sent
for
a
doctor
they
sent
for
a
priest
repeated
the
old
woman
with
a
gasp
she
is
so
ill
and
no
soothing
draught
nothing
on
her
table
the
mother
made
a
vague
sign
which
caroline
s
watchful
eye
understood
for
she
was
silent
to
let
her
mother
speak
they
brought
a
priest
to
hear
my
confession
as
they
beware
caroline
cried
the
old
woman
with
an
effort
the
priest
made
me
tell
him
your
benefactor
s
but
who
can
have
told
you
poor
mother
the
old
woman
died
trying
to
look
knowingly
cunning
if
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
had
noted
her
mother
s
face
she
might
have
seen
what
no
one
ever
will
see
death
laughing
to
enter
into
the
interests
that
lay
beneath
this
introduction
to
my
tale
we
must
for
a
moment
forget
the
actors
in
it
and
look
back
at
certain
previous
incidents
of
which
the
last
was
closely
concerned
with
the
death
of
madame
crochard
the
two
parts
will
then
form
a
whole
a
story
which
by
a
law
peculiar
to
life
in
paris
was
made
up
of
two
distinct
sets
of
actions
towards
the
close
of
the
month
of
november
a
young
barrister
aged
about
was
going
down
the
stairs
of
the
hotel
where
the
high
chancellor
of
the
empire
resided
at
about
three
o
clock
one
morning
having
reached
the
courtyard
in
full
evening
dress
under
a
keen
frost
he
could
not
help
giving
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
dismay
qualified
however
by
the
spirit
which
rarely
deserts
a
frenchman
at
seeing
no
hackney
coach
waiting
outside
the
gates
and
hearing
no
noises
such
as
arise
from
the
wooden
shoes
or
harsh
voices
of
the
of
paris
the
occasional
pawing
of
the
horses
of
the
chief
justice
s
carriage
the
young
man
having
left
him
still
playing
with
cambaceres
alone
rang
out
in
the
paved
court
which
was
scarcely
lighted
by
the
carriage
lamps
suddenly
the
young
lawyer
felt
a
friendly
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
turning
round
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
judge
to
whom
he
bowed
as
the
footman
let
down
the
steps
of
his
carriage
the
old
gentleman
who
had
served
the
convention
suspected
the
junior
s
dilemma
all
cats
are
gray
in
the
dark
said
he
the
chief
justice
can
not
compromise
himself
by
putting
a
pleader
in
the
right
way
especially
he
went
on
when
the
pleader
is
the
nephew
of
an
old
colleague
one
of
the
lights
of
the
grand
council
of
state
which
gave
france
the
napoleonic
at
a
gesture
from
the
chief
magistrate
of
france
under
the
empire
the
got
into
the
carriage
where
do
you
live
asked
the
great
man
before
the
footman
who
awaited
his
orders
had
closed
the
door
quai
des
augustins
the
horses
started
and
the
young
man
found
himself
alone
with
the
minister
to
whom
he
had
vainly
tried
to
speak
before
and
after
the
sumptuous
dinner
given
by
cambaceres
in
fact
the
great
man
had
evidently
avoided
him
throughout
the
evening
well
monsieur
granville
you
are
on
the
high
road
so
long
as
i
sit
by
your
excellency
s
side
nay
i
am
not
jesting
said
the
minister
you
were
called
two
years
since
and
your
defence
in
the
case
of
simeuse
and
hauteserre
had
raised
you
high
in
your
i
had
supposed
that
my
interest
in
those
unfortunate
emigres
had
done
me
no
you
are
still
very
young
said
the
great
man
gravely
but
the
high
chancellor
he
went
on
after
a
pause
was
greatly
pleased
with
you
this
evening
get
a
judgeship
in
the
lower
courts
we
want
men
the
nephew
of
a
man
in
whom
cambaceres
and
i
take
great
interest
must
not
remain
in
the
background
for
lack
of
encouragement
your
uncle
helped
us
to
tide
over
a
very
stormy
season
and
services
of
that
kind
are
not
the
minister
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
before
long
he
went
on
i
shall
have
three
vacancies
open
in
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
imperial
court
in
paris
come
to
see
me
and
take
the
place
you
prefer
till
then
work
hard
but
do
not
be
seen
at
my
receptions
in
the
first
place
i
am
overwhelmed
with
work
and
besides
that
your
rivals
may
suspect
your
purpose
and
do
you
harm
with
the
patron
cambaceres
and
i
by
not
speaking
a
word
to
you
this
evening
have
averted
the
accusation
of
as
the
great
man
ceased
speaking
the
carriage
drew
up
on
the
quai
des
augustins
the
young
lawyer
thanked
his
generous
patron
for
the
two
lifts
he
had
conferred
on
him
and
then
knocked
at
his
door
pretty
loudly
for
the
bitter
wind
blew
cold
about
his
calves
at
last
the
old
lodgekeeper
pulled
up
the
latch
and
as
the
young
man
passed
his
window
called
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
monsieur
granville
here
is
a
letter
for
the
young
man
took
the
letter
and
in
spite
of
the
cold
tried
to
identify
the
writing
by
the
gleam
of
a
dull
lamp
fast
dying
out
from
my
father
he
exclaimed
as
he
took
his
bedroom
candle
which
the
porter
at
last
had
lighted
and
he
ran
up
to
his
room
to
read
the
following
epistle
set
off
by
the
next
mail
and
if
you
can
get
here
soon
enough
your
fortune
is
made
mademoiselle
angelique
bontems
has
lost
her
sister
she
is
now
an
only
child
and
as
we
know
she
does
not
hate
you
madame
bontems
can
now
leave
her
about
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
besides
whatever
she
may
give
her
when
she
marries
i
have
prepared
the
way
our
friends
will
wonder
to
see
a
family
of
old
nobility
allying
itself
to
the
bontems
old
bontems
was
a
red
republican
of
the
deepest
dye
owning
large
quantities
of
the
nationalized
land
that
he
bought
for
a
mere
song
but
he
held
nothing
but
convent
lands
and
the
monks
will
not
come
back
and
then
as
you
have
already
so
far
derogated
as
to
become
a
lawyer
i
can
not
see
why
we
should
shrink
from
a
further
concession
to
the
prevalent
ideas
the
girl
will
have
three
hundred
thousand
francs
i
can
give
you
a
hundred
thousand
your
mother
s
property
must
be
worth
fifty
thousand
crowns
more
or
less
so
if
you
choose
to
take
a
judgeship
my
dear
son
you
are
quite
in
a
position
to
become
a
senator
as
much
as
any
other
man
my
the
councillor
of
state
will
not
indeed
lend
you
a
still
as
he
is
not
married
his
property
will
some
day
be
yours
and
if
you
are
not
senator
by
your
own
efforts
you
will
get
it
through
him
then
you
will
be
perched
high
enough
to
look
on
at
events
farewell
yours
so
young
granville
went
to
bed
full
of
schemes
each
fairer
than
the
last
under
the
powerful
protection
of
the
high
chancellor
the
chief
justice
and
his
mother
s
brother
one
of
the
originators
of
the
code
he
was
about
to
make
a
start
in
a
coveted
position
before
the
highest
court
of
the
empire
and
he
already
saw
himself
a
member
of
the
bench
whence
napoleon
selected
the
chief
functionaries
of
the
realm
he
could
also
promise
himself
a
fortune
handsome
enough
to
keep
up
his
rank
for
which
the
slender
income
of
five
thousand
francs
from
an
estate
left
him
by
his
mother
would
be
quite
insufficient
to
crown
his
ambitious
dreams
with
a
vision
of
happiness
he
called
up
the
guileless
face
of
mademoiselle
angelique
bontems
the
companion
of
his
childhood
until
he
came
to
boyhood
his
father
and
mother
had
made
no
objection
to
his
intimacy
with
their
neighbor
s
pretty
little
daughter
but
when
during
his
brief
holiday
visits
to
bayeux
his
parents
who
prided
themselves
on
their
good
birth
saw
what
friends
the
young
people
were
they
forbade
his
ever
thinking
of
her
thus
for
ten
years
past
granville
had
only
had
occasional
glimpses
of
the
girl
whom
he
still
sometimes
thought
of
as
his
little
and
in
those
brief
moments
when
they
met
free
from
the
active
watchfulness
of
their
families
they
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
few
vague
civilities
at
the
church
door
or
in
the
street
their
happiest
days
had
been
those
when
brought
together
by
one
of
those
country
festivities
known
in
normandy
as
they
could
steal
a
glance
at
each
other
from
afar
in
the
course
of
the
last
vacation
granville
had
twice
seen
angelique
and
her
downcast
eyes
and
drooping
attitude
had
led
him
to
suppose
that
she
was
crushed
by
some
unknown
tyranny
he
was
off
by
seven
next
morning
to
the
coach
office
in
the
rue
and
was
so
lucky
as
to
find
a
vacant
seat
in
the
diligence
then
starting
for
caen
it
was
not
without
deep
emotion
that
the
young
lawyer
saw
once
more
the
spires
of
the
cathedral
at
bayeux
as
yet
no
hope
of
his
life
had
been
cheated
and
his
heart
swelled
with
the
generous
feelings
that
expand
in
the
youthful
soul
after
the
too
lengthy
feast
of
welcome
prepared
by
his
father
who
awaited
him
with
some
friends
the
impatient
youth
was
conducted
to
a
house
long
familiar
to
him
standing
in
the
rue
teinture
his
heart
beat
high
when
his
father
still
known
in
the
town
of
bayeux
as
the
comte
de
granville
knocked
loudly
at
a
carriage
gate
off
which
the
green
paint
was
dropping
in
scales
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
a
young
in
a
cotton
cap
dropped
a
short
curtsey
to
the
two
gentlemen
and
said
that
the
ladies
would
soon
be
home
from
vespers
the
count
and
his
son
were
shown
into
a
low
room
used
as
a
but
more
like
a
convent
parlor
polished
panels
of
dark
walnut
made
it
gloomy
enough
and
around
it
some
chairs
covered
with
worsted
work
and
stiff
armchairs
were
symmetrically
arranged
the
stone
had
no
ornament
but
a
discolored
mirror
and
on
each
side
of
it
were
the
twisted
branches
of
a
pair
of
such
as
were
made
at
the
time
of
the
peace
of
utrecht
against
a
panel
opposite
young
granville
saw
an
enormous
crucifix
of
ebony
and
ivory
surrounded
by
a
wreath
of
box
that
had
been
blessed
though
there
were
three
windows
to
the
room
looking
out
on
a
garden
laid
out
in
formal
square
beds
edged
with
box
the
room
was
so
dark
that
it
was
difficult
to
discern
on
the
wall
opposite
the
windows
three
pictures
of
sacred
subjects
painted
by
a
skilled
hand
and
purchased
no
doubt
during
the
revolution
by
old
bontems
who
as
governor
of
the
district
had
never
neglected
his
opportunities
from
the
carefully
polished
floor
to
the
green
checked
holland
curtains
everything
shone
with
conventual
cleanliness
the
young
man
s
heart
felt
an
involuntary
chill
in
this
silent
retreat
where
angelique
dwelt
the
habit
of
frequenting
the
glittering
paris
and
the
constant
whirl
of
society
had
effaced
from
his
memory
the
dull
and
peaceful
surroundings
of
a
country
life
and
the
contrast
was
so
startling
as
to
give
him
a
sort
of
internal
shiver
to
have
just
left
a
party
at
the
house
of
cambaceres
where
life
was
so
large
where
minds
could
expand
where
the
splendor
of
the
imperial
court
was
so
vividly
reflected
and
to
be
dropped
suddenly
into
a
sphere
of
squalidly
narrow
ideas
was
it
not
like
a
leap
from
italy
into
greenland
living
here
is
not
life
said
he
to
himself
as
he
looked
round
the
methodistical
room
the
old
count
seeing
his
son
s
dismay
went
up
to
him
and
taking
his
hand
led
him
to
a
window
where
there
was
still
a
gleam
of
daylight
and
while
the
maid
was
lighting
the
yellow
tapers
in
the
candle
branches
he
tried
to
clear
away
the
clouds
that
the
dreary
place
had
brought
to
his
brow
listen
my
boy
said
he
old
bontems
widow
is
a
frenzied
bigot
when
the
devil
is
old
you
know
i
see
that
the
place
goes
against
the
grain
well
this
is
the
whole
truth
the
old
woman
is
they
have
persuaded
her
that
it
was
high
time
to
make
sure
of
heaven
and
the
better
to
secure
saint
peter
and
his
keys
she
pays
she
goes
to
mass
every
day
attends
every
service
takes
the
communion
every
sunday
god
has
made
and
amuses
herself
by
restoring
chapels
she
had
given
so
many
ornaments
and
albs
and
chasubles
she
has
crowned
the
canopy
with
so
many
feathers
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
corpus
christi
procession
as
great
a
crowd
came
together
as
to
see
a
man
hanged
just
to
stare
at
the
priests
in
their
splendid
dresses
and
all
the
vessels
regilt
this
house
too
is
a
sort
of
holy
land
it
was
i
who
hindered
her
from
giving
those
three
pictures
to
the
church
a
domenichino
a
correggio
and
an
andrea
del
sarto
worth
a
good
deal
of
but
angelique
asked
the
young
man
if
you
do
not
marry
her
angelique
is
done
for
said
the
count
our
holy
apostles
counsel
her
to
live
a
virgin
martyr
i
have
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
stirring
up
her
little
heart
since
she
has
been
the
only
child
by
talking
to
her
of
you
but
as
you
will
easily
understand
as
soon
as
she
is
married
you
will
carry
her
off
to
paris
there
festivities
married
life
the
theatres
and
the
rush
of
parisian
society
will
soon
make
her
forget
confessionals
and
fasting
and
hair
shirts
and
masses
which
are
the
exclusive
nourishment
of
such
but
the
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
derived
from
church
property
will
not
all
that
return
that
is
the
point
exclaimed
the
count
with
a
cunning
glance
in
consideration
of
this
marriage
for
madame
bontems
vanity
is
not
a
little
flattered
by
the
notion
of
grafting
the
bontems
on
to
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
granvilles
the
aforenamed
mother
agrees
to
settle
her
fortune
absolutely
on
the
girl
reserving
only
a
the
priesthood
therefore
are
set
against
the
marriage
but
i
have
had
the
banns
published
everything
is
ready
and
in
a
week
you
will
be
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
mother
and
her
abbes
you
will
have
the
prettiest
girl
in
bayeux
a
good
little
soul
who
will
give
you
no
trouble
because
she
has
sound
principles
she
has
been
mortified
as
they
say
in
their
jargon
by
fasting
and
prayer
and
he
added
in
a
low
voice
by
her
a
modest
tap
at
the
door
silenced
the
count
who
expected
to
see
the
two
ladies
appear
a
little
page
came
in
evidently
in
a
great
hurry
but
abashed
by
the
presence
of
the
two
gentlemen
he
beckoned
to
a
housekeeper
who
followed
him
dressed
in
a
blue
cloth
jacket
with
short
tails
and
striped
trousers
his
hair
cut
short
all
round
the
boy
s
expression
was
that
of
a
chorister
so
strongly
was
it
stamped
with
the
compulsory
propriety
that
marks
every
member
of
a
bigoted
household
mademoiselle
gatienne
said
he
do
you
know
where
the
books
are
for
the
offices
of
the
virgin
the
ladies
of
the
congregation
of
the
sacred
heart
are
going
in
procession
this
evening
round
the
gatienne
went
in
search
of
the
books
will
they
go
on
much
longer
my
little
man
asked
the
count
oh
half
an
hour
at
let
us
go
to
look
on
said
the
father
to
his
son
there
will
be
some
pretty
women
there
and
a
visit
to
the
cathedral
can
do
us
no
the
young
lawyer
followed
him
with
a
doubtful
expression
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
count
the
matter
father
is
that
i
am
sure
i
am
but
you
have
said
no
but
i
have
been
thinking
that
you
have
still
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
left
of
your
original
fortune
you
will
leave
them
to
me
as
long
a
time
hence
as
possible
i
hope
but
if
you
are
ready
to
give
me
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
make
a
foolish
match
you
will
surely
allow
me
to
ask
you
for
only
fifty
thousand
to
save
me
from
such
a
misfortune
and
enjoy
as
a
bachelor
a
fortune
equal
to
what
your
mademoiselle
bontems
would
bring
are
you
crazy
no
father
these
are
the
facts
the
chief
justice
promised
me
yesterday
that
i
should
have
a
seat
on
the
bench
fifty
thousand
francs
added
to
what
i
have
and
to
the
pay
of
my
appointment
will
give
me
an
income
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
and
i
then
shall
most
certainly
have
a
chance
of
marrying
a
fortune
better
than
this
alliance
which
will
be
poor
in
happiness
if
rich
in
it
is
very
clear
said
his
father
that
you
were
not
brought
up
under
the
old
does
a
man
of
our
rank
ever
allow
his
wife
to
be
in
his
way
but
my
dear
father
in
these
days
marriage
is
bless
me
cried
the
count
interrupting
his
son
then
what
my
old
friends
tell
me
is
true
i
suppose
the
revolution
has
left
us
habits
devoid
of
pleasure
and
has
infected
all
the
young
men
with
vulgar
principles
you
like
my
jacobin
will
harangue
me
i
suppose
on
the
nation
public
morals
and
disinterestedness
good
heavens
but
for
the
emperor
s
sisters
where
should
we
be
the
still
hale
old
man
whom
the
peasants
on
the
estate
persisted
in
calling
the
signeur
de
granville
ended
his
speech
as
they
entered
the
cathedral
porch
in
spite
of
the
sanctity
of
the
place
and
even
as
he
dipped
his
fingers
in
the
holy
water
he
hummed
an
air
from
the
opera
of
et
and
then
led
the
way
down
the
side
aisles
stopping
by
each
pillar
to
survey
the
rows
of
heads
all
in
lines
like
ranks
of
soldiers
on
parade
the
special
service
of
the
sacred
heart
was
about
to
begin
the
ladies
affiliated
to
that
congregation
were
in
front
near
the
choir
so
the
count
and
his
son
made
their
way
to
that
part
of
the
nave
and
stood
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
where
there
was
least
light
whence
they
could
command
a
view
of
this
mass
of
faces
looking
like
a
meadow
full
of
flowers
suddenly
close
to
young
granville
a
voice
sweeter
than
it
seemed
possible
to
ascribe
to
a
human
being
broke
into
song
like
the
first
nightingale
when
winter
is
past
though
it
mingled
with
the
voices
of
a
thousand
other
women
and
the
notes
of
the
organ
that
voice
stirred
his
nerves
as
though
they
vibrated
to
the
too
full
and
too
piercing
sounds
of
a
harmonium
the
parisian
turned
round
and
seeing
a
young
figure
though
the
head
being
bent
her
face
was
entirely
concealed
by
a
large
white
bonnet
concluded
that
the
voice
was
hers
he
fancied
that
he
recognized
angelique
in
spite
of
a
brown
merino
pelisse
that
wrapped
her
and
he
nudged
his
father
s
elbow
yes
there
she
is
said
the
count
after
looking
where
his
son
pointed
and
then
by
an
expressive
glance
he
directed
his
attention
to
the
pale
face
of
an
elderly
woman
who
had
already
detected
the
strangers
though
her
false
eyes
deep
set
in
dark
circles
did
not
seem
to
have
strayed
from
the
she
held
angelique
raised
her
face
gazing
at
the
altar
as
if
to
inhale
the
heavy
scent
of
the
incense
that
came
wafted
in
clouds
over
the
two
women
and
then
in
the
doubtful
light
that
the
tapers
shed
down
the
nave
with
that
of
a
central
lamp
and
of
some
lights
round
the
pillars
the
young
man
beheld
a
face
which
shook
his
determination
a
white
bonnet
closely
framed
features
of
perfect
regularity
the
oval
being
completed
by
the
satin
ribbon
tie
that
fastened
it
under
her
dimpled
chin
over
her
forehead
very
sweet
though
low
hair
of
a
pale
gold
color
parted
in
two
bands
and
fell
over
her
cheeks
like
the
shadow
of
leaves
on
a
flower
the
arches
of
her
eyebrows
were
drawn
with
the
accuracy
we
admire
in
the
best
chinese
paintings
her
nose
almost
aquiline
in
profile
was
exceptionally
firmly
cut
and
her
lips
were
like
two
rose
lines
lovingly
traced
with
a
delicate
brush
her
eyes
of
a
light
blue
were
expressive
of
innocence
though
granville
discerned
a
sort
of
rigid
reserve
in
this
girlish
face
he
could
ascribe
it
to
the
devotion
in
which
angelique
was
rapt
the
solemn
words
of
prayer
visible
in
the
cold
came
from
between
rows
of
pearls
like
a
fragrant
mist
as
it
were
the
young
man
involuntarily
bent
over
her
a
little
to
breathe
this
diviner
air
this
movement
attracted
the
girl
s
notice
her
gaze
raised
to
the
altar
was
diverted
to
granville
whom
she
could
see
but
dimly
in
the
gloom
but
she
recognized
him
as
the
companion
of
her
youth
and
a
memory
more
vivid
than
prayer
brought
a
supernatural
glow
to
her
face
she
blushed
the
young
lawyer
was
thrilled
with
joy
at
seeing
the
hopes
of
another
life
overpowered
by
those
of
love
and
the
glory
of
the
sanctuary
eclipsed
by
earthly
reminiscences
but
his
triumph
was
brief
angelique
dropped
her
veil
assumed
a
calm
demeanor
and
went
on
singing
without
letting
her
voice
betray
the
least
emotion
granville
was
a
prey
to
one
single
wish
and
every
thought
of
prudence
vanished
by
the
time
the
service
was
ended
his
impatience
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
leave
the
ladies
to
go
home
alone
but
came
at
once
to
make
his
bow
to
his
little
they
bashfully
greeted
each
other
in
the
cathedral
porch
in
the
presence
of
the
congregation
madame
bontems
was
tremulous
with
pride
as
she
took
the
comte
de
granville
s
arm
though
he
forced
to
offer
it
in
the
presence
of
all
the
world
was
vexed
enough
with
his
son
for
his
impatience
for
about
a
fortnight
between
the
official
announcement
of
the
intended
marriage
of
the
vicomte
de
granville
to
mademoiselle
bontems
and
the
solemn
day
of
the
wedding
he
came
assiduously
to
visit
his
in
the
dismal
to
which
he
became
accustomed
his
long
calls
were
devoted
to
watching
angelique
s
character
for
his
prudence
happily
had
made
itself
heard
again
in
the
day
after
their
first
meeting
he
always
found
her
seated
at
a
little
table
of
some
west
indian
wood
and
engaged
in
marking
the
linen
of
her
trousseau
angelique
never
spoke
first
on
the
subject
of
religion
if
the
young
lawyer
amused
himself
with
fingering
the
handsome
rosary
that
she
kept
in
a
little
green
velvet
bag
if
he
laughed
as
he
looked
at
a
relic
such
as
usually
is
attached
to
this
means
of
grace
angelique
would
gently
take
the
rosary
out
of
his
hands
and
replace
it
in
the
bag
without
a
word
putting
it
away
at
once
when
now
and
then
granville
was
so
bold
as
to
make
mischievous
remarks
as
to
certain
religious
practices
the
pretty
girl
listened
to
him
with
the
obstinate
smile
of
assurance
you
must
either
believe
nothing
or
believe
everything
the
church
teaches
she
would
say
would
you
wish
to
have
a
woman
without
a
religion
as
the
mother
of
your
children
what
man
may
dare
judge
as
between
disbelievers
and
god
and
how
can
i
then
blame
what
the
church
allows
angelique
appeared
to
be
animated
by
such
fervent
charity
the
young
man
saw
her
look
at
him
with
such
perfect
conviction
that
he
sometimes
felt
tempted
to
embrace
her
religious
views
her
firm
belief
that
she
was
in
the
only
right
road
aroused
doubts
in
his
mind
which
she
tried
to
turn
to
account
but
then
granville
committed
the
fatal
blunder
of
mistaking
the
enchantment
of
desire
for
that
of
love
angelique
was
so
happy
in
reconciling
the
voice
of
her
heart
with
that
of
duty
by
giving
way
to
a
liking
that
had
grown
up
with
her
from
childhood
that
the
deluded
man
could
not
discern
which
of
the
two
spoke
the
louder
are
not
all
young
men
ready
to
trust
the
promise
of
a
pretty
face
and
to
infer
beauty
of
soul
from
beauty
of
feature
an
indefinable
impulse
leads
them
to
believe
that
moral
perfection
must
with
physical
perfection
if
angelique
had
not
been
at
liberty
to
give
vent
to
her
sentiments
they
would
soon
have
dried
up
in
her
heart
like
a
plant
watered
with
some
deadly
acid
how
should
a
lover
be
aware
of
bigotry
so
well
hidden
this
was
the
course
of
young
granville
s
feelings
during
that
fortnight
devoured
by
him
like
a
book
of
which
the
end
is
absorbing
angelique
carefully
watched
by
him
seemed
the
gentlest
of
creatures
and
he
even
caught
himself
feeling
grateful
to
madame
bontems
who
by
implanting
so
deeply
the
principles
of
religion
had
in
some
degree
inured
her
to
meet
the
troubles
of
life
on
the
day
named
for
signing
the
inevitable
contract
madame
bontems
made
her
pledge
himself
solemnly
to
respect
her
daughter
s
religious
practices
to
allow
her
entire
liberty
of
conscience
to
permit
her
to
go
to
communion
to
church
to
confession
as
often
as
she
pleased
and
never
to
control
her
choice
of
priestly
advisers
at
this
critical
moment
angelique
looked
at
her
future
husband
with
such
pure
and
innocent
eyes
that
granville
did
not
hesitate
to
give
his
word
a
smile
puckered
the
lips
of
the
abbe
fontanon
a
pale
man
who
directed
the
consciences
of
this
household
mademoiselle
bontems
by
a
slight
nod
seemed
to
promise
that
she
would
never
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
this
freedom
as
to
the
old
count
he
gently
whistled
the
tune
of
an
old
song
s
ils
go
and
see
if
they
are
coming
on
a
few
days
after
the
wedding
festivities
of
which
so
much
is
thought
in
the
provinces
granville
and
his
wife
went
to
paris
whither
the
young
man
was
recalled
by
his
appointment
as
public
prosecutor
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
seine
circuit
when
the
young
couple
set
out
to
find
a
residence
angelique
used
the
influence
that
the
honeymoon
gives
to
every
wife
in
persuading
her
husband
to
take
a
large
apartment
in
the
of
a
house
at
the
corner
of
the
vieille
rue
du
temple
and
the
rue
nueve
her
chief
reason
for
this
choice
was
that
the
house
was
close
to
the
rue
d
orleans
where
there
was
a
church
and
not
far
from
a
small
chapel
in
the
rue
a
good
housewife
provides
for
everything
said
her
husband
laughing
angelique
pointed
out
to
him
that
this
part
of
paris
known
as
the
marais
was
within
easy
reach
of
the
palais
de
justice
and
that
the
lawyers
they
knew
lived
in
the
neighborhood
a
fairly
large
garden
made
the
apartment
particularly
advantageous
to
a
young
couple
the
children
if
heaven
should
send
them
any
could
play
in
the
open
air
the
courtyard
was
spacious
and
there
were
good
stables
the
lawyer
wished
to
live
in
the
chaussee
d
antin
where
everything
is
fresh
and
bright
where
the
fashions
may
be
seen
while
still
new
where
a
crowd
throngs
the
boulevards
and
the
distance
is
less
to
the
theatres
or
places
of
amusement
but
he
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
the
coaxing
ways
of
a
young
wife
who
asked
this
as
his
first
favor
so
to
please
her
he
settled
in
the
marais
granville
s
duties
required
him
to
work
hard
all
the
more
because
they
were
new
to
him
so
he
devoted
himself
in
the
first
place
to
furnishing
his
private
study
and
arranging
his
books
he
was
soon
established
in
a
room
crammed
with
papers
and
left
the
decoration
of
the
house
to
his
wife
he
was
all
the
better
pleased
to
plunge
angelique
into
the
bustle
of
buying
furniture
and
fittings
the
source
of
so
much
pleasure
and
of
so
many
associations
to
most
young
women
because
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
depriving
her
of
his
company
more
often
than
the
usages
of
early
married
life
require
as
soon
as
his
work
was
fairly
under
way
he
gladly
allowed
his
wife
to
tempt
him
out
of
his
study
to
consider
the
effect
of
furniture
or
hangings
which
he
had
before
only
seen
piecemeal
or
unfinished
if
the
old
adage
is
true
that
says
a
woman
may
be
judged
of
from
her
front
door
her
rooms
must
express
her
mind
with
even
greater
fidelity
madame
de
granville
had
perhaps
stamped
the
various
things
she
had
ordered
with
the
seal
of
her
own
character
the
young
lawyer
was
certainly
startled
by
the
cold
arid
solemnity
that
reigned
in
these
rooms
he
found
nothing
to
charm
his
taste
everything
was
discordant
nothing
gratified
the
eye
the
rigid
mannerism
that
prevailed
in
the
at
bayeux
had
invaded
his
home
the
broad
panels
were
hollowed
in
circles
and
decorated
with
those
arabesques
of
which
the
long
monotonous
mouldings
are
in
such
bad
taste
anxious
to
find
excuses
for
his
wife
the
young
husband
began
again
looking
first
at
the
long
and
lofty
through
which
the
apartment
was
entered
the
color
of
the
panels
as
ordered
by
his
wife
was
too
heavy
and
the
very
dark
green
velvet
used
to
cover
the
benches
added
to
the
gloom
of
this
entrance
not
to
be
sure
an
important
room
but
giving
a
first
impression
just
as
we
measure
a
man
s
intelligence
by
his
first
address
an
is
a
kind
of
preface
which
announces
what
is
to
follow
but
promises
nothing
the
young
husband
wondered
whether
his
wife
could
really
have
chosen
the
lamp
of
an
antique
pattern
which
hung
in
the
centre
of
this
bare
hall
the
pavement
of
black
and
white
marble
and
the
paper
in
imitation
of
blocks
of
stone
with
green
moss
on
them
in
places
a
handsome
but
not
new
barometer
hung
on
the
middle
of
one
of
the
walls
as
if
to
accentuate
the
void
at
the
sight
of
it
all
he
looked
round
at
his
wife
he
saw
her
so
much
pleased
by
the
red
braid
binding
to
the
cotton
curtains
so
satisfied
with
the
barometer
and
the
strictly
decent
statue
that
ornamented
a
large
gothic
stove
that
he
had
not
the
barbarous
courage
to
overthrow
such
deep
convictions
instead
of
blaming
his
wife
granville
blamed
himself
accusing
himself
of
having
failed
in
his
duty
of
guiding
the
first
steps
in
paris
of
a
girl
brought
up
at
bayeux
from
this
specimen
what
might
not
be
expected
of
the
other
rooms
what
was
to
be
looked
for
from
a
woman
who
took
fright
at
the
bare
legs
of
a
caryatid
and
who
would
not
look
at
a
chandelier
or
a
if
she
saw
on
it
the
nude
outlines
of
an
egyptian
bust
at
this
date
the
school
of
david
was
at
the
height
of
its
glory
all
the
art
of
france
bore
the
stamp
of
his
correct
design
and
his
love
of
antique
types
which
indeed
gave
his
pictures
the
character
of
colored
sculpture
but
none
of
these
devices
of
imperial
luxury
found
civic
rights
under
madame
de
granville
s
roof
the
spacious
square
remained
as
it
had
been
left
from
the
time
of
louis
in
white
and
tarnished
gold
lavishly
adorned
by
the
architect
with
checkered
and
the
hideous
garlands
due
to
the
uninventive
designers
of
the
time
still
if
harmony
at
least
had
prevailed
if
the
furniture
of
modern
mahogany
had
but
assumed
the
twisted
forms
of
which
boucher
s
corrupt
taste
first
set
the
fashion
angelique
s
room
would
only
have
suggested
the
fantastic
contrast
of
a
young
couple
in
the
nineteenth
century
living
as
though
they
were
in
the
eighteenth
but
a
number
of
details
were
in
ridiculous
discord
the
consoles
the
clocks
the
candelabra
were
decorated
with
the
military
trophies
which
the
wars
of
the
empire
commended
to
the
affections
of
the
parisians
and
the
greek
helmets
the
roman
crossed
daggers
and
the
shields
so
dear
to
military
enthusiasm
that
they
were
introduced
on
furniture
of
the
most
peaceful
uses
had
no
fitness
side
by
side
with
the
delicate
and
profuse
arabesques
that
delighted
madame
de
pompadour
bigotry
tends
to
an
indescribably
tiresome
kind
of
humility
which
does
not
exclude
pride
whether
from
modesty
or
by
choice
madame
de
granville
seemed
to
have
a
horror
of
light
and
cheerful
colors
perhaps
too
she
imagined
that
brown
and
purple
beseemed
the
dignity
of
a
magistrate
how
could
a
girl
accustomed
to
an
austere
life
have
admitted
the
luxurious
divans
that
may
suggest
evil
thoughts
the
elegant
and
tempting
boudoirs
where
naughtiness
may
be
imagined
the
poor
husband
was
in
despair
from
the
tone
in
which
he
approved
only
seconding
the
praises
she
bestowed
on
herself
angelique
understood
that
nothing
really
pleased
him
and
she
expressed
so
much
regret
at
her
want
of
success
that
granville
who
was
very
much
in
love
regarded
her
disappointment
as
a
proof
of
her
affection
instead
of
resentment
for
an
offence
to
her
after
all
could
he
expect
a
girl
just
snatched
from
the
humdrum
of
country
notions
with
no
experience
of
the
niceties
and
grace
of
paris
life
to
know
or
do
any
better
rather
would
he
believe
that
his
wife
s
choice
had
been
overruled
by
the
tradesmen
than
allow
himself
to
own
the
truth
if
he
had
been
less
in
love
he
would
have
understood
that
the
dealers
always
quick
to
discern
their
customers
ideas
had
blessed
heaven
for
sending
them
a
tasteless
little
bigot
who
would
take
their
goods
off
their
hands
so
he
comforted
the
pretty
provincial
happiness
dear
angelique
does
not
depend
on
a
more
or
less
elegant
piece
of
furniture
it
depends
on
the
wife
s
sweetness
gentleness
and
why
it
is
my
duty
to
love
you
said
angelique
mildly
and
i
can
have
no
more
delightful
duty
to
carry
nature
has
implanted
in
the
heart
of
woman
so
great
a
desire
to
please
so
deep
a
craving
for
love
that
even
in
a
youthful
bigot
the
ideas
of
salvation
and
a
future
existence
must
give
way
to
the
happiness
of
early
married
life
and
in
fact
from
the
month
of
april
when
they
were
married
till
the
beginning
of
winter
the
husband
and
wife
lived
in
perfect
union
love
and
hard
work
have
the
grace
of
making
a
man
tolerably
indifferent
to
external
matters
being
obliged
to
spend
half
the
day
in
court
fighting
for
the
gravest
interests
of
men
s
lives
or
fortunes
granville
was
less
alive
than
another
might
have
been
to
certain
facts
in
his
household
if
on
a
friday
he
found
none
but
lenten
fare
and
by
chance
asked
for
a
dish
of
meat
without
getting
it
his
wife
forbidden
by
the
gospel
to
tell
a
lie
could
still
by
such
subterfuges
as
are
permissible
in
the
interests
of
religion
cloak
what
was
premeditated
purpose
under
some
pretext
of
her
own
carelessness
or
the
scarcity
in
the
market
she
would
often
exculpate
herself
at
the
expense
of
the
cook
and
even
go
so
far
as
to
scold
him
at
that
time
young
lawyers
did
not
as
they
do
now
keep
the
fasts
of
the
church
the
four
rogation
seasons
and
the
vigils
of
festivals
so
granville
was
not
at
first
aware
of
the
regular
recurrence
of
these
lenten
meals
which
his
wife
took
care
should
be
made
dainty
by
the
addition
of
teal
and
that
their
amphibious
meat
or
high
seasoning
might
cheat
his
palate
thus
the
young
man
unconsciously
lived
in
strict
orthodoxy
and
worked
out
his
salvation
without
knowing
it
on
he
did
not
know
whether
his
wife
went
to
mass
or
no
on
sundays
with
very
natural
amiability
he
accompanied
her
to
church
to
make
up
to
her
as
it
were
for
sometimes
giving
up
vespers
in
favor
of
his
company
he
could
not
at
first
fully
enter
into
the
strictness
of
his
wife
s
religious
views
the
theatres
being
impossible
in
summer
by
reason
of
the
heat
granville
had
not
even
the
opportunity
of
the
great
success
of
a
piece
to
give
rise
to
the
serious
question
of
and
in
short
at
the
early
stage
of
a
union
to
which
a
man
has
been
led
by
a
young
girl
s
beauty
he
can
hardly
be
exacting
as
to
his
amusements
youth
is
greedy
rather
than
dainty
and
possession
has
a
charm
in
itself
how
should
he
be
keen
to
note
coldness
dignity
and
reserve
in
the
woman
to
whom
he
ascribes
the
excitement
he
himself
feels
and
lends
the
glow
of
the
fire
that
burns
within
him
he
must
have
attained
a
certain
conjugal
calm
before
he
discovers
that
a
bigot
sits
waiting
for
love
with
her
arms
folded
granville
therefore
believed
himself
happy
till
a
fatal
event
brought
its
influence
to
bear
on
his
married
life
in
the
month
of
november
the
canon
of
bayeux
cathedral
who
had
been
the
keeper
of
madame
bontems
conscience
and
her
daughter
s
came
to
paris
spurred
by
the
ambition
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
church
in
the
capital
a
position
which
he
regarded
perhaps
as
the
to
a
bishopric
on
resuming
his
former
control
of
this
wandering
lamb
he
was
horrified
to
find
her
already
so
much
deteriorated
by
the
air
of
paris
and
strove
to
reclaim
her
to
his
chilly
fold
frightened
by
the
exhortations
of
this
priest
a
man
of
about
who
brought
with
him
into
the
circle
of
the
enlightened
and
tolerant
paris
clergy
the
bitter
provincial
catholicism
and
the
inflexible
bigotry
which
fetter
timid
souls
with
endless
exactions
madame
de
granville
did
penance
and
returned
from
her
jansenist
errors
it
would
be
tiresome
to
describe
minutely
all
the
circumstances
which
insensibly
brought
disaster
on
this
household
it
will
be
enough
to
relate
the
simple
facts
without
giving
them
in
strict
order
of
time
the
first
misunderstanding
between
the
young
couple
was
however
a
serious
one
when
granville
took
his
wife
into
society
she
never
declined
solemn
functions
such
as
dinners
concerts
or
parties
given
by
the
judges
superior
to
her
husband
in
the
legal
profession
but
for
a
long
time
she
constantly
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
a
sick
headache
when
they
were
invited
to
a
ball
one
day
granville
out
of
patience
with
these
assumed
indispositions
destroyed
a
note
of
invitation
to
a
ball
at
the
house
of
a
councillor
of
state
and
gave
his
wife
only
a
verbal
invitation
then
on
the
evening
her
health
being
quite
above
suspicion
he
took
her
to
a
magnificent
entertainment
my
dear
said
he
on
their
return
home
seeing
her
wear
an
offensive
air
of
depression
your
position
as
a
wife
the
rank
you
hold
in
society
and
the
fortune
you
enjoy
impose
on
you
certain
duties
of
which
no
divine
law
can
relieve
you
are
you
not
your
husband
s
pride
you
are
required
to
go
to
balls
when
i
go
and
to
appear
in
a
becoming
and
what
is
there
my
dear
so
disastrous
in
my
dress
it
is
your
manner
my
dear
when
a
young
man
comes
up
to
speak
to
you
you
look
so
serious
that
a
spiteful
person
might
believe
you
doubtful
of
your
own
virtue
you
seem
to
fear
lest
a
smile
should
undo
you
you
really
look
as
if
you
were
asking
forgiveness
of
god
for
the
sins
that
may
be
committed
around
you
the
world
my
dearest
is
not
a
but
as
you
mentioned
your
dress
i
may
confess
to
you
that
it
is
no
less
a
duty
to
conform
to
the
customs
and
fashions
of
do
you
wish
that
i
should
display
my
shape
like
those
indecent
women
who
wear
gowns
so
low
that
impudent
eyes
can
stare
at
their
bare
shoulders
and
their
there
is
a
difference
my
dear
said
her
husband
interrupting
her
between
uncovering
your
whole
bust
and
giving
some
grace
to
your
dress
you
wear
three
rows
of
net
frills
that
cover
your
throat
up
to
your
chin
you
look
as
if
you
had
desired
your
dressmaker
to
destroy
the
graceful
line
of
your
shoulders
and
bosom
with
as
much
care
as
a
coquette
would
devote
to
obtaining
from
hers
a
bodice
that
might
emphasize
her
covered
form
your
bust
is
wrapped
in
so
many
folds
that
every
one
was
laughing
at
your
affectation
of
prudery
you
would
be
really
grieved
if
i
were
to
repeat
the
remarks
made
on
your
those
who
admire
such
obscenity
will
not
have
to
bear
the
burthen
if
we
sin
said
the
lady
tartly
and
you
did
not
dance
asked
granville
i
shall
never
dance
she
replied
if
i
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
dance
said
her
husband
sharply
yes
you
ought
to
follow
the
fashions
to
wear
flowers
in
your
hair
and
diamonds
remember
my
dear
that
rich
people
and
we
are
rich
are
obliged
to
keep
up
luxury
in
the
state
is
it
not
far
better
to
encourage
manufacturers
than
to
distribute
money
in
the
form
of
alms
through
the
medium
of
the
clergy
you
talk
as
a
statesman
said
angelique
and
you
as
a
priest
he
retorted
the
discussion
was
bitter
madame
de
granville
s
answers
though
spoken
very
sweetly
and
in
a
voice
as
clear
as
a
church
bell
showed
an
obstinacy
that
betrayed
priestly
influence
when
she
appealed
to
the
rights
secured
to
her
by
granville
s
promise
she
added
that
her
director
specially
forbade
her
going
to
balls
then
her
husband
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
priest
was
overstepping
the
regulations
of
the
church
this
odious
theological
dispute
was
renewed
with
great
violence
and
acerbity
on
both
sides
when
granville
proposed
to
take
his
wife
to
the
play
finally
the
lawyer
whose
sole
aim
was
to
defeat
the
pernicious
influence
exerted
over
his
wife
by
her
old
confessor
placed
the
question
on
such
a
footing
that
madame
de
granville
in
a
spirit
of
defiance
referred
it
by
writing
to
the
court
of
rome
asking
in
so
many
words
whether
a
woman
could
wear
low
gowns
and
go
to
the
play
and
to
balls
without
compromising
her
salvation
the
reply
of
the
venerable
pope
pius
vii
came
at
once
strongly
condemning
the
wife
s
recalcitrancy
and
blaming
the
priest
this
letter
a
chapter
on
conjugal
duties
might
have
been
dictated
by
the
spirit
of
fenelon
whose
grace
and
tenderness
pervaded
every
line
a
wife
is
right
to
go
wherever
her
husband
may
take
her
even
if
she
sins
by
his
command
she
will
not
be
ultimately
held
these
two
sentences
of
the
pope
s
homily
only
made
madame
de
granville
and
her
director
accuse
him
of
irreligion
but
before
this
letter
had
arrived
granville
had
discovered
the
strict
observance
of
fast
days
that
his
wife
forced
upon
him
and
gave
his
servants
orders
to
serve
him
with
meat
every
day
in
the
year
however
much
annoyed
his
wife
might
be
by
these
commands
granville
who
cared
not
a
straw
for
such
indulgence
or
abstinence
persisted
with
manly
determination
is
it
not
an
offence
to
the
weakest
creature
that
can
think
at
all
to
be
compelled
to
do
by
the
will
of
another
anything
that
he
would
otherwise
have
done
simply
of
his
own
accord
of
all
forms
of
tyranny
the
most
odious
is
that
which
constantly
robs
the
soul
of
the
merit
of
its
thoughts
and
deeds
it
has
to
abdicate
without
having
reigned
the
word
we
are
readiest
to
speak
the
feelings
we
most
love
to
express
die
when
we
are
commanded
to
utter
them
ere
long
the
young
man
ceased
to
invite
his
friends
to
give
parties
or
dinners
the
house
might
have
been
shrouded
in
crape
a
house
where
the
mistress
is
a
bigot
has
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
the
servants
who
are
of
course
under
her
immediate
control
are
chosen
among
a
class
who
call
themselves
pious
and
who
have
an
unmistakable
physiognomy
just
as
the
jolliest
fellow
alive
when
he
joins
the
has
the
countenance
of
a
gendarme
so
those
who
give
themselves
over
to
the
habit
of
lowering
their
eyes
and
preserving
a
sanctimonious
mien
clothes
them
in
a
livery
of
hypocrisy
which
rogues
can
affect
to
perfection
and
besides
bigots
constitute
a
sort
of
republic
they
all
know
each
other
the
servants
they
recommend
and
hand
on
from
one
to
another
are
a
race
apart
and
preserved
by
them
as
will
admit
no
animal
into
their
stables
that
has
not
a
pedigree
the
more
the
impious
as
they
are
thought
come
to
understand
a
household
of
bigots
the
more
they
perceive
that
everything
is
stamped
with
an
indescribable
squalor
they
find
there
at
the
same
time
an
appearance
of
avarice
and
mystery
as
in
a
miser
s
home
and
the
dank
scent
of
cold
incense
which
gives
a
chill
to
the
stale
atmosphere
of
a
chapel
this
methodical
meanness
this
narrowness
of
thought
which
is
visible
in
every
detail
can
only
be
expressed
by
one
word
bigotry
in
these
sinister
and
pitiless
houses
bigotry
is
written
on
the
furniture
the
prints
the
pictures
speech
is
bigoted
the
silence
is
bigoted
the
faces
are
those
of
bigots
the
transformation
of
men
and
things
into
bigotry
is
an
inexplicable
mystery
but
the
fact
is
evident
everybody
can
see
that
bigots
do
not
walk
do
not
sit
do
not
speak
as
men
of
the
world
walk
sit
and
speak
under
their
roof
every
one
is
ill
at
ease
no
one
laughs
stiffness
and
formality
infect
everything
from
the
mistress
cap
down
to
her
pincushion
eyes
are
not
honest
the
folks
are
more
like
shadows
and
the
lady
of
the
house
seems
perched
on
a
throne
of
ice
one
morning
poor
granville
discerned
with
grief
and
pain
that
all
the
symptoms
of
bigotry
had
invaded
his
home
there
are
in
the
world
different
spheres
in
which
the
same
effects
are
seen
though
produced
by
dissimilar
causes
dulness
hedges
such
miserable
homes
round
with
walls
of
brass
enclosing
the
horrors
of
the
desert
and
the
infinite
void
the
home
is
not
so
much
a
tomb
as
that
far
worse
thing
a
convent
in
the
center
of
this
icy
sphere
the
lawyer
could
study
his
wife
dispassionately
he
observed
not
without
keen
regret
the
that
stood
confessed
in
the
very
way
that
her
hair
grew
low
on
the
forehead
which
was
slightly
depressed
he
discovered
in
the
perfect
regularity
of
her
features
a
certain
set
rigidity
which
before
long
made
him
hate
the
assumed
sweetness
that
had
bewitched
him
intuition
told
him
that
one
day
of
disaster
those
thin
lips
might
say
my
dear
it
is
for
your
good
madame
de
granville
s
complexion
was
acquiring
a
dull
pallor
and
an
austere
expression
that
were
a
to
all
who
came
near
her
was
this
change
wrought
by
the
ascetic
habits
of
a
pharisaism
which
is
not
piety
any
more
than
avarice
is
economy
it
would
be
hard
to
say
beauty
without
expression
is
perhaps
an
imposture
this
imperturbable
set
smile
that
the
young
wife
always
wore
when
she
looked
at
granville
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
jesuitical
formula
of
happiness
by
which
she
thought
to
satisfy
all
the
requirements
of
married
life
her
charity
was
an
offence
her
soulless
beauty
was
monstrous
to
those
who
knew
her
the
mildness
of
her
speech
was
an
irritation
she
acted
not
on
feeling
but
on
duty
there
are
faults
which
may
yield
in
a
wife
to
the
stern
lessons
of
experience
or
to
a
husband
s
warnings
but
nothing
can
counteract
false
ideas
of
religion
an
eternity
of
happiness
to
be
won
set
in
the
scale
against
worldly
enjoyment
triumphs
over
everything
and
makes
every
pang
endurable
is
it
not
the
apotheosis
of
egotism
of
self
beyond
the
grave
thus
even
the
pope
was
censured
at
the
tribunal
of
the
priest
and
the
young
devotee
to
be
always
in
the
right
is
a
feeling
which
absorbs
every
other
in
these
tyrannous
souls
for
some
time
past
a
secret
struggle
had
been
going
on
between
the
ideas
of
the
husband
and
wife
and
the
young
man
was
soon
weary
of
a
battle
to
which
there
could
be
no
end
what
man
what
temper
can
endure
the
sight
of
a
hypocritically
affectionate
face
and
categorical
resistance
to
his
slightest
wishes
what
is
to
be
done
with
a
wife
who
takes
advantage
of
his
passion
to
protect
her
coldness
who
seems
determined
on
being
blandly
inexorable
prepares
herself
ecstatically
to
play
the
martyr
and
looks
on
her
husband
as
a
scourge
from
god
a
means
of
flagellation
that
may
spare
her
the
fires
of
purgatory
what
picture
can
give
an
idea
of
these
women
who
make
virtue
hateful
by
defying
the
gentle
precepts
of
that
faith
which
saint
john
epitomized
in
the
words
love
one
another
if
there
was
a
bonnet
to
be
found
in
a
milliner
s
shop
that
was
condemned
to
remain
in
the
window
or
to
be
packed
off
to
the
colonies
granville
was
certain
to
see
it
on
his
wife
s
head
if
a
material
of
bad
color
or
hideous
design
were
to
be
found
she
would
select
it
these
hapless
bigots
are
in
their
notions
of
dress
want
of
taste
is
a
defect
inseparable
from
false
pietism
and
so
in
the
that
needs
the
fullest
sympathy
granville
had
no
true
companionship
he
went
out
alone
to
parties
and
the
theatres
nothing
in
his
house
appealed
to
him
a
huge
crucifix
that
hung
between
his
bed
and
angelique
s
seemed
figurative
of
his
destiny
does
it
not
represent
a
murdered
divinity
a
done
to
death
in
all
the
prime
of
life
and
beauty
the
ivory
of
that
cross
was
less
cold
than
angelique
crucifying
her
husband
under
the
plea
of
virtue
this
it
was
that
lay
at
the
root
of
their
woes
the
young
wife
saw
nothing
but
duty
where
she
should
have
given
love
here
one
ash
wednesday
rose
the
pale
and
spectral
form
of
fasting
in
lent
of
total
abstinence
commanded
in
a
severe
tone
and
granville
did
not
deem
it
advisable
to
write
in
his
turn
to
the
pope
and
take
the
opinion
of
the
consistory
on
the
proper
way
of
observing
lent
the
ember
days
and
the
eve
of
great
festivals
his
misfortune
was
too
great
he
could
not
even
complain
for
what
could
he
say
he
had
a
pretty
young
wife
attached
to
her
duties
virtuous
nay
a
model
of
all
the
virtues
she
had
a
child
every
year
nursed
them
herself
and
brought
them
up
in
the
highest
principles
being
charitable
angelique
was
promoted
to
rank
as
an
angel
the
old
women
who
constituted
the
circle
in
which
she
moved
for
at
that
time
it
was
not
yet
the
thing
for
young
women
to
be
religious
as
a
matter
of
fashion
all
admired
madame
de
granville
s
piety
and
regarded
her
not
indeed
as
a
virgin
but
as
a
martyr
they
blamed
not
the
wife
s
scruples
but
the
barbarous
philoprogenitiveness
of
the
husband
granville
by
insensible
degrees
overdone
with
work
bereft
of
conjugal
consolations
and
weary
of
a
world
in
which
he
wandered
alone
by
the
time
he
was
had
sunk
into
the
slough
of
despond
he
hated
life
having
too
lofty
a
notion
of
the
responsibilities
imposed
on
him
by
his
position
to
set
the
example
of
a
dissipated
life
he
tried
to
deaden
feeling
by
hard
study
and
began
a
great
book
on
law
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
enjoy
the
monastic
peace
he
had
hoped
for
when
the
celestial
angelique
saw
him
desert
worldly
society
to
work
at
home
with
such
regularity
she
tried
to
convert
him
it
had
been
a
real
sorrow
to
her
to
know
that
her
husband
s
opinions
were
not
strictly
christian
and
she
sometimes
wept
as
she
reflected
that
if
her
husband
should
die
it
would
be
in
a
state
of
final
impenitence
so
that
she
could
not
hope
to
snatch
him
from
the
eternal
fires
of
hell
thus
granville
was
a
mark
for
the
mean
ideas
the
vacuous
arguments
the
narrow
views
by
which
his
wife
fancying
she
had
achieved
the
first
victory
tried
to
gain
a
second
by
bringing
him
back
within
the
pale
of
the
church
this
was
the
last
straw
what
can
be
more
intolerable
than
the
blind
struggle
in
which
the
obstinacy
of
a
bigot
tries
to
meet
the
acumen
of
a
lawyer
what
more
terrible
to
endure
than
the
acrimonious
to
which
a
passionate
soul
prefers
a
granville
neglected
his
home
everything
there
was
unendurable
his
children
broken
by
their
mother
s
frigid
despotism
dared
not
go
with
him
to
the
play
indeed
granville
could
never
give
them
any
pleasure
without
bringing
down
punishment
from
their
terrible
mother
his
loving
nature
was
weaned
to
indifference
to
a
selfishness
worse
than
death
his
boys
indeed
he
saved
from
this
hell
by
sending
them
to
school
at
an
early
age
and
insisting
on
his
right
to
train
them
he
rarely
interfered
between
his
wife
and
her
daughters
but
he
was
resolved
that
they
should
marry
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
even
if
he
had
wished
to
take
violent
measures
he
could
have
found
no
justification
his
wife
backed
by
a
formidable
army
of
dowagers
would
have
had
him
condemned
by
the
whole
world
thus
granville
had
no
choice
but
to
live
in
complete
isolation
but
crushed
under
the
tyranny
of
misery
he
could
not
himself
bear
to
see
how
altered
he
was
by
grief
and
toil
and
he
dreaded
any
connection
or
intimacy
with
women
of
the
world
having
no
hope
of
finding
any
consolation
the
improving
history
of
this
melancholy
household
gave
rise
to
no
events
worthy
of
record
during
the
fifteen
years
between
and
madame
de
granville
was
exactly
the
same
after
losing
her
husband
s
affection
as
she
had
been
during
the
time
when
she
called
herself
happy
she
paid
for
masses
beseeching
god
and
the
saints
to
enlighten
her
as
to
what
the
faults
were
which
displeased
her
husband
and
to
show
her
the
way
to
restore
the
erring
sheep
but
the
more
fervent
her
prayers
the
less
was
granville
to
be
seen
at
home
for
about
five
years
now
having
achieved
a
high
position
as
a
judge
granville
had
occupied
the
of
the
house
to
avoid
living
with
the
comtesse
de
granville
every
morning
a
little
scene
took
place
which
if
evil
tongues
are
to
be
believed
is
repeated
in
many
households
as
the
result
of
incompatibility
of
temper
of
moral
or
physical
malady
or
of
antagonisms
leading
to
such
disaster
as
is
recorded
in
this
history
at
about
eight
in
the
morning
a
housekeeper
bearing
no
small
resemblance
to
a
nun
rang
at
the
comte
de
granville
s
door
admitted
to
the
room
next
to
the
judge
s
study
she
always
repeated
the
same
message
to
the
footman
and
always
in
the
same
tone
madame
would
be
glad
to
know
whether
monsieur
le
comte
has
had
a
good
night
and
if
she
is
to
have
the
pleasure
of
his
company
at
monsieur
presents
his
compliments
to
madame
la
comtesse
the
valet
would
say
after
speaking
with
his
master
and
begs
her
to
hold
him
excused
important
business
compels
him
to
be
in
court
this
a
minute
later
the
woman
reappeared
and
asked
on
madame
s
behalf
whether
she
would
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
monsieur
le
comte
before
he
went
out
he
is
gone
was
always
the
rely
though
often
his
carriage
was
still
waiting
this
little
dialogue
by
proxy
became
a
daily
ceremonial
granville
s
servant
a
favorite
with
his
master
and
the
cause
of
more
than
one
quarrel
over
his
irreligious
and
dissipated
conduct
would
even
go
into
his
master
s
room
as
a
matter
of
form
when
the
count
was
not
there
and
come
back
with
the
same
formula
in
reply
the
aggrieved
wife
was
always
on
the
watch
for
her
husband
s
return
and
standing
on
the
steps
so
as
to
meet
him
like
an
embodiment
of
remorse
the
petty
aggressiveness
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
monastic
temper
was
the
foundation
of
madame
de
granville
s
she
was
now
and
looked
forty
when
the
count
was
compelled
by
decency
to
speak
to
his
wife
or
to
dine
at
home
she
was
only
too
well
pleased
to
inflict
her
company
upon
him
with
her
remarks
and
the
intolerable
dulness
of
her
circle
and
she
tried
to
put
him
in
the
wrong
before
the
servants
and
her
charitable
friends
when
at
this
time
the
post
of
president
in
a
provincial
court
was
offered
to
the
comte
de
granville
who
was
in
high
favor
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
in
paris
this
refusal
of
which
the
keeper
of
the
seals
alone
knew
the
reasons
gave
rise
to
extraordinary
conjectures
on
the
part
of
the
countess
intimate
friends
and
of
her
director
granville
a
rich
man
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
belonged
to
one
of
the
first
families
of
normandy
his
appointment
to
be
presiding
judge
would
have
been
the
to
a
peer
s
seat
whence
this
strange
lack
of
ambition
why
had
he
given
up
his
great
book
on
law
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
dissipation
which
for
nearly
six
years
had
made
him
a
stranger
to
his
home
his
family
his
study
to
all
he
ought
to
hold
dear
the
countess
confessor
who
based
his
hopes
of
a
bishopric
quite
as
much
on
the
families
he
governed
as
on
the
services
he
rendered
to
an
association
of
which
he
was
an
ardent
propagator
was
much
disappointed
by
granville
s
refusal
and
tried
to
insinuate
calumnious
explanations
if
monsieur
le
comte
had
such
an
objection
to
provincial
life
it
was
perhaps
because
he
dreaded
finding
himself
under
the
necessity
of
leading
a
regular
life
compelled
to
set
an
example
of
moral
conduct
and
to
live
with
the
countess
from
whom
nothing
could
have
alienated
him
but
some
illicit
connection
for
how
could
a
woman
so
pure
as
madame
de
granville
ever
tolerate
the
disorderly
life
into
which
her
husband
had
drifted
the
sanctimonious
woman
accepted
as
facts
these
hints
which
unluckily
were
not
merely
hypothetical
and
madame
de
granville
was
stricken
as
by
a
thunderbolt
angelique
knowing
nothing
of
the
world
of
love
and
its
follies
was
so
far
from
conceiving
of
any
conditions
of
married
life
unlike
those
that
had
alienated
her
husband
as
possible
that
she
believed
him
to
be
incapable
of
the
errors
which
are
crimes
in
the
eyes
of
any
wife
when
the
count
ceased
to
demand
anything
of
her
she
imagined
that
the
tranquillity
he
now
seemed
to
enjoy
was
in
the
course
of
nature
and
as
she
had
really
given
to
him
all
the
love
which
her
heart
was
capable
of
feeling
for
a
man
while
the
priest
s
conjectures
were
the
utter
destruction
of
the
illusions
she
had
hitherto
cherished
she
defended
her
husband
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
eradicate
the
suspicion
that
had
been
so
ingeniously
sown
in
her
soul
these
alarms
wrought
such
havoc
in
her
feeble
brain
that
they
made
her
ill
she
was
worn
by
low
fever
these
incidents
took
place
during
lent
she
would
not
pretermit
her
austerities
and
fell
into
a
decline
that
put
her
life
in
danger
granville
s
indifference
was
added
torture
his
care
and
attention
were
such
as
a
nephew
feels
himself
bound
to
give
to
some
old
uncle
though
the
countess
had
given
up
her
persistent
nagging
and
remonstrances
and
tried
to
receive
her
husband
with
affectionate
words
the
sharpness
of
the
bigot
showed
through
and
one
speech
would
often
undo
the
work
of
a
week
towards
the
end
of
may
the
warm
breath
of
spring
and
more
nourishing
diet
than
her
lenten
fare
restored
madame
de
granville
to
a
little
strength
one
morning
on
coming
home
from
mass
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
in
the
little
garden
where
the
sun
s
kisses
reminded
her
of
the
early
days
of
her
married
life
and
she
looked
back
across
the
years
to
see
wherein
she
might
have
failed
in
her
duty
as
a
wife
and
mother
she
was
broken
in
upon
by
the
abbe
fontanon
in
an
almost
indescribable
state
of
excitement
has
any
misfortune
befallen
you
father
she
asked
with
filial
solicitude
ah
i
only
wish
cried
the
normandy
priest
that
all
the
woes
inflicted
on
you
by
the
hand
of
god
were
dealt
out
to
me
but
my
admirable
friend
there
are
trials
to
which
you
can
but
can
any
worse
punishments
await
me
than
those
with
which
providence
crushes
me
by
making
my
husband
the
instrument
of
his
wrath
you
must
prepare
yourself
daughter
to
yet
worse
mischief
than
we
and
your
pious
friends
had
ever
conceived
then
i
may
thank
god
said
the
countess
for
vouchsafing
to
use
you
as
the
messenger
of
his
will
and
thus
as
ever
setting
the
treasures
of
mercy
by
the
side
of
the
scourges
of
his
wrath
just
as
in
bygone
days
he
showed
a
spring
to
hagar
when
he
had
driven
her
into
the
he
measures
your
sufferings
by
the
strength
of
your
resignation
and
the
weight
of
your
speak
i
am
ready
to
hear
as
she
said
it
she
cast
her
eyes
up
to
heaven
speak
monsieur
for
seven
years
monsieur
granville
has
lived
in
sin
with
a
concubine
by
whom
he
has
two
children
and
on
this
adulterous
connection
he
has
spent
more
than
five
hundred
thousand
francs
which
ought
to
have
been
the
property
of
his
legitimate
i
must
see
it
to
believe
it
cried
the
countess
far
be
it
from
you
exclaimed
the
abbe
you
must
forgive
my
daughter
and
wait
in
patience
and
prayer
till
god
enlightens
your
husband
unless
indeed
you
choose
to
adopt
against
him
the
means
offered
you
by
human
the
long
conversation
that
ensued
between
the
priest
and
his
penitent
resulted
in
an
extraordinary
change
in
the
countess
she
abruptly
dismissed
him
called
her
servants
who
were
alarmed
at
her
flushed
face
and
crazy
energy
she
ordered
her
carriage
countermanded
it
changed
her
mind
twenty
times
in
the
hour
but
at
last
at
about
three
o
clock
as
if
she
had
come
to
some
great
determination
she
went
out
leaving
the
whole
household
in
amazement
at
such
a
sudden
transformation
is
the
count
coming
home
to
dinner
she
asked
of
his
servant
to
whom
she
would
never
speak
no
did
you
go
with
him
to
the
courts
this
morning
yes
and
is
monday
yes
then
do
the
courts
sit
on
mondays
nowadays
devil
take
you
cried
the
man
as
his
mistress
drove
off
after
saying
to
the
coachman
rue
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
was
weeping
roger
sitting
by
her
side
held
one
of
her
hands
between
his
own
he
was
silent
looking
by
turns
at
little
charles
who
not
understanding
his
mother
s
grief
stood
speechless
at
the
sight
of
her
tears
at
the
cot
where
eugenie
lay
sleeping
and
caroline
s
face
on
which
grief
had
the
effect
of
rain
falling
across
the
beams
of
cheerful
sunshine
yes
my
darling
said
roger
after
a
long
silence
that
is
the
great
secret
i
am
married
but
some
day
i
hope
we
may
form
but
one
family
my
wife
has
been
given
over
ever
since
last
march
i
do
not
wish
her
dead
still
if
it
should
please
god
to
take
her
to
himself
i
believe
she
will
be
happier
in
paradise
than
in
a
world
to
whose
griefs
and
pleasures
she
is
equally
how
i
hate
that
woman
how
could
she
bear
to
make
you
unhappy
and
yet
it
is
to
that
unhappiness
that
i
owe
my
happiness
her
tears
suddenly
ceased
caroline
let
us
hope
cried
roger
do
not
be
frightened
by
anything
that
priest
may
have
said
to
you
though
my
wife
s
confessor
is
a
man
to
be
feared
for
his
power
in
the
congregation
if
he
should
try
to
blight
our
happiness
i
would
find
means
what
could
you
do
we
would
go
to
italy
i
would
fly
a
shriek
that
rang
out
from
the
adjoining
room
made
roger
start
and
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
quake
but
she
rushed
into
the
and
there
found
madame
de
granville
in
a
dead
faint
when
the
countess
recovered
her
senses
she
sighed
deeply
on
finding
herself
supported
by
the
count
and
her
rival
whom
she
instinctively
pushed
away
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
rose
to
withdraw
you
are
at
home
madame
said
granville
taking
caroline
by
the
arm
the
judge
took
up
his
wife
in
his
arms
carried
her
to
the
carriage
and
got
into
it
with
her
who
is
it
that
has
brought
you
to
the
point
of
wishing
me
dead
of
resolving
to
fly
asked
the
countess
looking
at
her
husband
with
grief
mingled
with
indignation
was
i
not
young
you
thought
me
pretty
what
fault
have
you
to
find
with
me
have
i
been
false
to
you
have
i
not
been
a
virtuous
and
wife
my
heart
has
cherished
no
image
but
yours
my
ears
have
listened
to
no
other
voice
what
duty
have
i
failed
in
what
have
i
ever
denied
you
happiness
madame
said
the
count
severely
you
know
madame
that
there
are
two
ways
of
serving
god
some
christians
imagine
that
by
going
to
church
at
fixed
hours
to
say
a
by
attending
mass
regularly
and
avoiding
sin
they
may
win
heaven
but
they
madame
will
go
to
hell
they
have
not
loved
god
for
himself
they
have
not
worshiped
him
as
he
chooses
to
be
worshiped
they
have
made
no
sacrifice
though
mild
in
seeming
they
are
hard
on
their
neighbors
they
see
the
law
the
letter
not
the
this
is
how
you
have
treated
me
your
earthly
husband
you
have
sacrificed
my
happiness
to
your
salvation
you
were
always
absorbed
in
prayer
when
i
came
to
you
in
gladness
of
heart
you
wept
when
you
should
have
cheered
my
toil
you
have
never
tried
to
satisfy
any
demands
i
have
made
on
and
if
they
were
wicked
cried
the
countess
hotly
was
i
to
lose
my
soul
to
please
you
it
is
a
sacrifice
which
another
a
more
loving
woman
has
dared
to
make
said
granville
coldly
dear
god
she
cried
bursting
into
tears
thou
hearest
has
he
been
worthy
of
the
prayers
and
penance
i
have
lived
in
wearing
myself
out
to
atone
for
his
sins
and
my
own
of
what
avail
is
virtue
to
win
heaven
my
dear
a
woman
can
not
be
at
the
same
time
the
wife
of
a
man
and
the
spouse
of
christ
that
would
be
bigamy
she
must
choose
between
a
husband
and
a
nunnery
for
the
sake
of
future
advantage
you
have
stripped
your
soul
of
all
the
love
all
the
devotion
which
god
commands
that
you
should
have
for
me
you
have
cherished
no
feeling
but
hatred
have
i
not
loved
you
she
put
in
no
then
what
is
love
the
countess
involuntarily
inquired
love
my
dear
replied
granville
with
a
sort
of
ironical
surprise
you
are
incapable
of
understanding
it
the
cold
sky
of
normandy
is
not
that
of
spain
this
difference
of
climate
is
no
doubt
the
secret
of
our
to
yield
to
our
caprices
to
guess
them
to
find
pleasure
in
pain
to
sacrifice
the
world
s
opinion
your
pride
your
religion
even
and
still
regard
these
offerings
as
mere
grains
of
incense
burnt
in
honor
of
the
idol
that
is
love
the
love
of
cried
the
countess
in
horror
such
flames
can
not
last
and
must
soon
leave
nothing
but
ashes
and
cinders
regret
or
despair
a
wife
ought
in
my
opinion
to
bring
you
true
friendship
equable
warmth
you
speak
of
warmth
as
negroes
speak
of
ice
retorted
the
count
with
a
sardonic
smile
consider
that
the
humblest
daisy
has
more
charms
than
the
proudest
and
most
gorgeous
of
the
red
hawthorns
that
attract
us
in
spring
by
their
strong
scent
and
brilliant
at
the
same
time
he
went
on
i
will
do
you
justice
you
have
kept
so
precisely
in
the
straight
path
of
imaginary
duty
prescribed
by
law
that
only
to
make
you
understand
wherein
you
have
failed
towards
me
i
should
be
obliged
to
enter
into
details
which
would
offend
your
dignity
and
instruct
you
in
matters
which
would
seem
to
you
to
undermine
all
and
you
dare
to
speak
of
morality
when
you
have
but
just
left
the
house
where
you
have
dissipated
your
children
s
fortune
in
debaucheries
cried
the
countess
maddened
by
her
husband
s
reticence
there
madame
i
must
correct
you
said
the
count
coolly
interrupting
his
wife
though
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
is
rich
it
is
at
nobody
s
expense
my
uncle
was
master
of
his
fortune
and
had
several
heirs
in
his
lifetime
and
out
of
pure
friendship
regarding
her
as
his
niece
he
gave
her
the
little
estate
of
bellefeuille
as
for
anything
else
i
owe
it
to
his
liberality
such
conduct
is
only
worthy
of
a
jacobin
said
the
sanctimonious
angelique
madame
you
are
forgetting
that
your
own
father
was
one
of
the
jacobins
whom
you
scorn
so
uncharitably
said
the
count
severely
citizen
bontems
was
signing
at
a
time
when
my
uncle
was
doing
france
good
madame
de
granville
was
silenced
but
after
a
short
pause
the
remembrance
of
what
she
had
just
seen
reawakened
in
her
soul
the
jealousy
which
nothing
can
kill
in
a
woman
s
heart
and
she
murmured
as
if
to
herself
how
can
a
woman
thus
destroy
her
own
soul
and
that
of
others
bless
me
madame
replied
the
count
tired
of
this
dialogue
you
yourself
may
some
day
have
to
answer
that
the
countess
was
scared
you
perhaps
will
be
held
excused
by
the
merciful
judge
who
will
weigh
our
sins
he
went
on
in
consideration
of
the
conviction
with
which
you
have
worked
out
my
misery
i
do
not
hate
you
i
hate
those
who
have
perverted
your
heart
and
your
reason
you
have
prayed
for
me
just
as
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
has
given
me
her
heart
and
crowned
my
life
with
love
you
should
have
been
my
mistress
and
the
prayerful
saint
by
do
me
the
justice
to
confess
that
i
am
no
reprobate
no
debauchee
my
life
was
cleanly
alas
after
seven
years
of
wretchedness
the
craving
for
happiness
led
me
by
an
imperceptible
descent
to
love
another
woman
and
make
a
second
home
and
do
not
imagine
that
i
am
singular
there
are
in
this
city
thousands
of
husbands
all
led
by
various
causes
to
live
this
twofold
great
god
cried
the
countess
how
heavy
is
the
cross
thou
hast
laid
on
me
to
bear
if
the
husband
thou
hast
given
me
here
below
in
thy
wrath
can
only
be
made
happy
through
my
death
take
me
to
thyself
if
you
had
always
breathed
such
admirable
sentiments
and
such
devotion
we
should
be
happy
yet
said
the
count
coldly
indeed
cried
angelique
melting
into
a
flood
of
tears
forgive
me
if
i
have
done
any
wrong
yes
monsieur
i
am
ready
to
obey
you
in
all
things
feeling
sure
that
you
will
desire
nothing
but
what
is
just
and
natural
henceforth
i
will
be
all
you
can
wish
your
wife
to
if
your
purpose
madame
is
to
compel
me
to
say
that
i
no
longer
love
you
i
shall
find
the
cruel
courage
to
tell
you
so
can
i
command
my
heart
can
i
wipe
out
in
an
instant
the
traces
of
fifteen
years
of
suffering
i
have
ceased
to
these
words
contain
a
mystery
as
deep
as
lies
the
words
esteem
respect
friendship
may
be
won
lost
regained
but
as
to
love
i
might
school
myself
for
a
thousand
years
and
it
would
not
blossom
again
especially
for
a
woman
too
old
to
respond
to
i
hope
monsieur
le
comte
i
sincerely
hope
that
such
words
may
not
be
spoken
to
you
some
day
by
the
woman
you
love
and
in
such
a
tone
and
accent
will
you
put
on
a
dress
la
this
evening
and
come
to
the
opera
the
shudder
with
which
the
countess
received
the
suggestion
was
a
mute
reply
early
in
december
a
man
whose
perfectly
white
hair
and
worn
features
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
aged
by
grief
rather
than
by
years
was
walking
at
midnight
along
the
rue
gaillon
having
reached
a
house
of
modest
appearance
and
only
two
stories
high
he
paused
to
look
up
at
one
of
the
attic
windows
that
pierced
the
roof
at
regular
intervals
a
dim
light
scarcely
showed
through
the
humble
panes
some
of
which
had
been
repaired
with
paper
the
man
below
was
watching
the
wavering
glimmer
with
the
vague
curiosity
of
a
paris
idler
when
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
house
as
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
fell
full
on
the
face
of
the
first
comer
it
will
not
seem
surprising
that
in
spite
of
the
darkness
this
young
man
went
towards
the
though
with
the
hesitancy
that
is
usual
when
we
have
any
fear
of
making
a
mistake
in
recognizing
an
acquaintance
what
is
it
you
cried
he
monsieur
le
president
alone
at
this
hour
and
so
far
from
the
rue
allow
me
to
have
the
honor
of
giving
you
my
the
pavement
is
so
greasy
this
morning
that
if
we
do
not
hold
each
other
up
he
added
to
soothe
the
elder
man
s
susceptibilities
we
shall
find
it
hard
to
escape
a
but
my
dear
sir
i
am
no
more
than
unfortunately
for
me
replied
the
comte
de
granville
a
physician
of
your
celebrity
must
know
that
at
that
age
a
man
is
still
hale
and
then
you
are
in
waiting
on
a
lady
i
suppose
replied
horace
bianchon
you
are
not
i
imagine
in
the
habit
of
going
about
paris
on
foot
when
a
man
keeps
such
fine
horses
still
when
i
am
not
visiting
in
the
evening
i
commonly
return
from
the
courts
or
the
club
on
foot
replied
the
count
and
with
large
sums
of
money
about
you
perhaps
cried
the
doctor
it
is
a
positive
invitation
to
the
assassin
s
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
said
granville
with
melancholy
indifference
but
at
least
do
not
stand
about
said
the
doctor
leading
the
count
towards
the
boulevard
a
little
more
and
i
shall
believe
that
you
are
bent
of
robbing
me
of
your
last
illness
and
dying
by
some
other
hand
than
you
caught
me
playing
the
spy
said
the
count
whether
on
foot
or
in
a
carriage
and
at
whatever
hour
of
the
night
i
may
come
by
i
have
for
some
time
past
observed
at
a
window
on
the
third
floor
of
your
house
the
shadow
of
a
person
who
seems
to
work
with
heroic
the
count
paused
as
if
he
felt
some
sudden
pain
and
i
take
as
great
an
interest
in
that
garret
he
went
on
as
a
citizen
of
paris
must
feel
in
the
finishing
of
the
palais
well
said
horace
bianchon
eagerly
i
can
tell
you
tell
me
nothing
replied
granville
cutting
the
doctor
short
i
would
not
give
a
centime
to
know
whether
the
shadow
that
moves
across
that
shabby
blind
is
that
of
a
man
or
a
woman
nor
whether
the
inhabitant
of
that
attic
is
happy
or
miserable
though
i
was
surprised
to
see
no
one
at
work
there
this
evening
and
though
i
stopped
to
look
it
was
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
indulging
in
conjectures
as
numerous
and
as
idiotic
as
those
of
idlers
who
see
a
building
left
half
finished
for
nine
years
my
young
the
count
hesitated
to
use
a
word
then
he
waved
his
hand
exclaiming
no
i
will
not
say
friend
i
hate
everything
that
savors
of
well
for
nine
years
past
i
have
ceased
to
wonder
that
old
men
amuse
themselves
with
growing
flowers
and
planting
trees
the
events
of
life
have
taught
them
disbelief
in
all
human
affection
and
i
grew
old
within
a
few
days
i
will
no
longer
attach
myself
to
any
creature
but
to
unreasoning
animals
or
plants
or
superficial
things
i
think
more
of
taglioni
s
grace
than
of
all
human
feeling
i
abhor
life
and
the
world
in
which
i
live
alone
nothing
nothing
he
went
on
in
a
tone
that
startled
the
younger
man
no
nothing
can
move
or
interest
but
you
have
children
my
children
he
repeated
bitterly
yes
well
is
not
my
eldest
daughter
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
the
other
will
through
her
sister
s
connections
make
some
good
match
as
to
my
sons
have
they
not
succeeded
the
viscount
was
public
prosecutor
at
limoges
and
is
now
president
of
the
court
at
orleans
the
younger
is
public
prosecutor
in
my
children
have
their
own
cares
their
own
anxieties
and
business
to
attend
to
if
of
all
those
hearts
one
had
been
devoted
to
me
if
one
had
tried
by
entire
affection
to
fill
up
the
void
i
have
here
and
he
struck
his
breast
well
that
one
would
have
failed
in
life
have
sacrificed
it
to
me
and
why
should
he
why
to
bring
sunshine
into
my
few
remaining
years
and
would
he
have
succeeded
might
i
not
have
accepted
such
generosity
as
a
debt
but
doctor
and
the
count
smiled
with
deep
irony
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
we
teach
them
arithmetic
and
how
to
count
at
this
moment
perhaps
they
are
waiting
for
my
o
monsieur
le
comte
how
could
such
an
idea
enter
your
head
you
who
are
kind
friendly
and
humane
indeed
if
i
were
not
myself
a
living
proof
of
the
benevolence
you
exercise
so
liberally
and
so
nobly
to
please
myself
replied
the
count
i
pay
for
a
sensation
as
i
would
pay
a
pile
of
gold
to
recover
the
most
childish
illusion
that
would
but
make
my
heart
i
help
my
for
my
own
sake
just
as
i
gamble
and
i
look
for
gratitude
from
none
i
should
see
you
die
without
blinking
and
i
beg
of
you
to
feel
the
same
with
regard
to
me
i
tell
you
young
man
the
events
of
life
have
swept
over
my
heart
like
the
lavas
of
vesuvius
over
herculaneum
the
town
is
there
those
who
have
brought
a
soul
as
warm
and
as
living
as
yours
was
to
such
a
pitch
of
indifference
are
indeed
guilty
say
no
more
said
the
count
with
a
shudder
of
aversion
you
have
a
malady
which
you
ought
to
allow
me
to
treat
said
bianchon
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
what
do
you
know
of
a
cure
for
death
cried
the
count
irritably
i
undertake
monsieur
le
comte
to
revive
the
heart
you
believe
to
be
are
you
a
match
for
talma
then
asked
the
count
satirically
no
monsieur
le
comte
but
nature
is
as
far
above
talma
as
talma
is
superior
to
listen
the
garret
you
are
interested
in
is
inhabited
by
a
woman
of
about
thirty
and
in
her
love
is
carried
to
fanaticism
the
object
of
her
adoration
is
a
young
man
of
pleasing
appearance
but
endowed
by
some
malignant
fairy
with
every
conceivable
vice
this
fellow
is
a
gambler
and
it
is
hard
to
say
which
he
is
most
addicted
to
wine
or
women
he
has
to
my
knowledge
committed
acts
deserving
punishment
by
law
well
and
to
him
this
unhappy
woman
sacrificed
a
life
of
ease
a
man
who
worshiped
her
and
the
father
of
her
but
what
is
wrong
monsieur
le
comte
nothing
go
she
has
allowed
him
to
squander
a
perfect
fortune
she
would
i
believe
give
him
the
world
if
she
had
it
she
works
night
and
day
and
many
a
time
she
has
without
a
murmur
seen
the
wretch
she
adores
rob
her
even
of
the
money
saved
to
buy
the
clothes
the
children
need
and
their
food
for
the
morrow
only
three
days
ago
she
sold
her
hair
the
finest
hair
i
ever
saw
he
came
in
she
could
not
hide
the
gold
piece
quickly
enough
and
he
asked
her
for
it
for
a
smile
for
a
kiss
she
gave
up
the
price
of
a
fortnight
s
life
and
peace
is
it
not
dreadful
and
yet
sublime
but
work
is
wearing
her
cheeks
hollow
her
children
s
crying
has
broken
her
heart
she
is
ill
and
at
this
moment
on
her
wretched
bed
this
evening
they
had
nothing
to
eat
the
children
have
not
strength
to
cry
they
were
silent
when
i
went
horace
bianchon
stood
still
just
then
the
comte
de
granville
in
spite
of
himself
as
it
were
had
put
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
can
guess
my
young
friend
how
it
is
that
she
is
yet
alive
if
you
attend
her
said
the
elder
man
o
poor
soul
cried
the
doctor
who
could
refuse
to
help
her
i
only
wish
i
were
richer
for
i
hope
to
cure
her
of
her
but
how
can
you
expect
me
to
pity
a
form
of
misery
of
which
the
joys
to
me
would
seem
cheaply
purchased
with
my
whole
fortune
exclaimed
the
count
taking
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
empty
of
the
notes
which
bianchon
had
supposed
his
patron
to
be
feeling
for
that
woman
feels
she
is
alive
would
not
louis
xv
have
given
his
kingdom
to
rise
from
the
grave
and
have
three
days
of
youth
and
life
and
is
not
that
the
history
of
thousands
of
dead
men
thousands
of
sick
men
thousands
of
old
men
poor
caroline
cried
bianchon
as
he
heard
the
name
the
count
shuddered
and
grasped
the
doctor
s
arm
with
the
grip
of
an
iron
vise
as
it
seemed
to
bianchon
her
name
is
caroline
crochard
asked
the
president
in
a
voice
that
was
evidently
broken
then
you
know
her
said
the
doctor
astonished
and
the
wretch
s
name
is
ay
you
have
kept
your
word
exclaimed
granville
you
have
roused
my
heart
to
the
most
terrible
pain
it
can
suffer
till
it
is
dust
that
emotion
too
is
a
gift
from
hell
and
i
always
know
how
to
pay
those
by
this
time
the
count
and
the
doctor
had
reached
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
chaussee
d
antin
one
of
those
who
wonder
round
with
a
basket
on
their
back
and
crook
in
hand
and
were
during
the
revolution
facetiously
called
the
committee
of
research
was
standing
by
the
curbstone
where
the
two
men
now
stopped
this
scavenger
had
a
shriveled
face
worthy
of
those
immortalized
by
charlet
in
his
caricatures
of
the
sweepers
of
paris
do
you
ever
pick
up
a
note
now
and
then
and
you
restore
them
it
depends
on
the
reward
you
re
the
man
for
me
cried
the
count
giving
the
man
a
note
take
this
but
remember
i
give
it
to
you
on
condition
of
your
spending
it
at
the
wineshop
of
your
getting
drunk
fighting
beating
your
wife
blacking
your
friends
eyes
that
will
give
work
to
the
watch
the
surgeon
the
druggist
perhaps
to
the
police
the
public
prosecutor
the
judge
and
the
prison
warders
do
not
try
to
do
anything
else
or
the
devil
will
be
revenged
on
you
sooner
or
a
draughtsman
would
need
at
once
the
pencil
of
charlet
and
of
callot
the
brush
of
teniers
and
of
rembrandt
to
give
a
true
notion
of
this
now
i
have
squared
accounts
with
hell
and
had
some
pleasure
for
my
money
said
the
count
in
a
deep
voice
pointing
out
the
indescribable
physiognomy
of
the
gaping
scavenger
to
the
doctor
who
stood
stupefied
as
for
caroline
crochard
she
may
die
of
hunger
and
thirst
hearing
the
heartrending
shrieks
of
her
starving
children
and
convinced
of
the
baseness
of
the
man
she
loves
i
will
not
give
a
sou
to
rescue
her
and
because
you
have
helped
her
i
will
see
you
no
more
the
count
left
bianchon
standing
like
a
statue
and
walked
as
briskly
as
a
young
man
to
the
rue
soon
reaching
the
little
house
where
he
resided
and
where
to
his
surprise
he
found
a
carriage
waiting
at
the
door
monsieur
your
son
the
came
about
an
hour
since
said
the
and
is
waiting
for
you
in
your
granville
signed
to
the
man
to
leave
him
what
motive
can
be
strong
enough
to
require
you
to
infringe
the
order
i
have
given
my
children
never
to
come
to
me
unless
i
send
for
them
asked
the
count
of
his
son
as
he
went
into
the
room
father
replied
the
younger
man
in
a
tremulous
voice
and
with
great
respect
i
venture
to
hope
that
you
will
forgive
me
when
you
have
heard
your
reply
is
proper
said
the
count
sit
down
and
he
pointed
to
a
chair
but
whether
i
walk
up
and
down
or
take
a
seat
speak
without
heeding
father
the
son
went
on
this
afternoon
at
four
o
clock
a
very
young
man
who
was
arrested
in
the
house
of
a
friend
of
mine
whom
he
had
robbed
to
a
considerable
extent
appealed
to
he
says
he
is
your
his
name
asked
the
count
hoarsely
charles
that
will
do
said
the
father
with
an
imperious
wave
of
the
hand
granville
paced
the
room
in
solemn
silence
and
his
son
took
care
not
to
break
it
my
son
he
began
and
the
words
were
pronounced
in
a
voice
so
mild
and
fatherly
that
the
young
lawyer
started
charles
crochard
spoke
the
i
am
glad
you
came
to
me
my
good
eugene
he
added
here
is
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
he
gave
him
a
bundle
of
banknotes
you
can
make
any
use
of
them
you
think
proper
in
this
matter
i
trust
you
implicitly
and
approve
beforehand
whatever
arrangements
you
may
make
either
in
the
present
or
for
the
eugene
my
dear
son
kiss
me
we
part
perhaps
for
the
last
time
i
shall
crave
my
dismissal
from
the
king
and
i
am
going
to
italy
though
a
father
owes
no
account
of
his
life
to
his
children
he
is
bound
to
bequeath
to
them
the
experience
fate
sells
him
so
dearly
is
it
not
a
part
of
their
inheritance
when
you
marry
the
count
went
on
with
a
little
involuntary
shudder
do
not
undertake
it
lightly
that
act
is
the
most
important
of
all
which
society
requires
of
us
remember
to
study
at
your
leisure
the
character
of
the
woman
who
is
to
be
your
partner
but
consult
me
too
i
will
judge
of
her
myself
a
lack
of
union
between
husband
and
wife
from
whatever
cause
leads
to
terrible
misfortune
sooner
or
later
we
are
always
punished
for
contravening
the
social
but
