i
fear
the
seemingly
incredible
story
which
i
am
about
to
relate
will
be
regarded
as
the
result
of
a
distorted
intellect
superinduced
possibly
by
the
glamour
of
unveiling
a
marvelous
mystery
rather
than
a
truthful
record
of
the
unparalleled
experiences
related
by
one
olaf
jansen
whose
eloquent
madness
so
appealed
to
my
imagination
that
all
thought
of
an
analytical
criticism
has
been
effectually
dispelled
marco
polo
will
doubtless
shift
uneasily
in
his
grave
at
the
strange
story
i
am
called
upon
to
chronicle
a
story
as
strange
as
a
munchausen
tale
it
is
also
incongruous
that
i
a
disbeliever
should
be
the
one
to
edit
the
story
of
olaf
jansen
whose
name
is
now
for
the
first
time
given
to
the
world
yet
who
must
hereafter
rank
as
one
of
the
notables
of
earth
i
freely
confess
his
statements
admit
of
no
rational
analysis
but
have
to
do
with
the
profound
mystery
concerning
the
frozen
north
that
for
centuries
has
claimed
the
attention
of
scientists
and
laymen
alike
however
much
they
are
at
variance
with
the
cosmographical
manuscripts
of
the
past
these
plain
statements
may
be
relied
upon
as
a
record
of
the
things
olaf
jansen
claims
to
have
seen
with
his
own
eyes
a
hundred
times
i
have
asked
myself
whether
it
is
possible
that
the
world
geography
is
incomplete
and
that
the
startling
narrative
of
olaf
jansen
is
predicated
upon
demonstrable
facts
the
reader
may
be
able
to
answer
these
queries
to
his
own
satisfaction
however
far
the
chronicler
of
this
narrative
may
be
from
having
reached
a
conviction
yet
sometimes
even
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
i
have
been
led
away
from
an
abstract
truth
by
the
ignes
fatui
of
a
clever
superstition
or
whether
heretofore
accepted
facts
are
after
all
founded
upon
falsity
it
may
be
that
the
true
home
of
apollo
was
not
at
delphi
but
in
that
older
of
which
plato
speaks
where
he
says
real
home
is
among
the
hyperboreans
in
a
land
of
perpetual
life
where
mythology
tells
us
two
doves
flying
from
the
two
opposite
ends
of
the
world
met
in
this
fair
region
the
home
of
apollo
indeed
according
to
hecataeus
leto
the
mother
of
apollo
was
born
on
an
island
in
the
arctic
ocean
far
beyond
the
north
wind
it
is
not
my
intention
to
attempt
a
discussion
of
the
theogony
of
the
deities
nor
the
cosmogony
of
the
world
my
simple
duty
is
to
enlighten
the
world
concerning
a
heretofore
unknown
portion
of
the
universe
as
it
was
seen
and
described
by
the
old
norseman
olaf
jansen
interest
in
northern
research
is
international
eleven
nations
are
engaged
in
or
have
contributed
to
the
perilous
work
of
trying
to
solve
earth
one
remaining
cosmological
mystery
there
is
a
saying
ancient
as
the
hills
that
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
and
in
a
most
startling
manner
has
this
axiom
been
brought
home
to
me
within
the
last
fortnight
it
was
just
two
in
the
morning
when
i
was
aroused
from
a
restful
sleep
by
the
vigorous
ringing
of
my
the
untimely
disturber
proved
to
be
a
messenger
bearing
a
note
scrawled
almost
to
the
point
of
illegibility
from
an
old
norseman
by
the
name
of
olaf
jansen
after
much
deciphering
i
made
out
the
writing
which
simply
said
am
ill
unto
death
come
the
call
was
imperative
and
i
lost
no
time
in
making
ready
to
comply
perhaps
i
may
as
well
explain
here
that
olaf
jansen
a
man
who
quite
recently
celebrated
his
birthday
has
for
the
last
years
been
living
alone
in
an
unpretentious
bungalow
out
glendale
way
a
short
distance
from
the
business
district
of
los
angeles
california
it
was
less
than
two
years
ago
while
out
walking
one
afternoon
that
i
was
attracted
by
olaf
jansen
house
and
its
homelike
surroundings
toward
its
owner
and
occupant
whom
i
afterward
came
to
know
as
a
believer
in
the
ancient
worship
of
odin
and
thor
there
was
a
gentleness
in
his
face
and
a
kindly
expression
in
the
keenly
alert
gray
eyes
of
this
man
who
had
lived
more
than
years
and
ten
and
withal
a
sense
of
loneliness
that
appealed
to
my
sympathy
slightly
stooped
and
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
he
walked
back
and
forth
with
slow
and
measured
tread
that
day
when
first
we
met
i
can
hardly
say
what
particular
motive
impelled
me
to
pause
in
my
walk
and
engage
him
in
conversation
he
seemed
pleased
when
i
complimented
him
on
the
attractiveness
of
his
bungalow
and
on
the
vines
and
flowers
clustering
in
profusion
over
its
windows
roof
and
wide
piazza
i
soon
discovered
that
my
new
acquaintance
was
no
ordinary
person
but
one
profound
and
learned
to
a
remarkable
degree
a
man
who
in
the
later
years
of
his
long
life
had
dug
deeply
into
books
and
become
strong
in
the
power
of
meditative
silence
i
encouraged
him
to
talk
and
soon
gathered
that
he
had
resided
only
six
or
seven
years
in
southern
california
but
had
passed
the
dozen
years
prior
in
one
of
the
middle
eastern
states
before
that
he
had
been
a
fisherman
off
the
coast
of
norway
in
the
region
of
the
lofoden
islands
from
whence
he
had
made
trips
still
farther
north
to
spitzbergen
and
even
to
franz
josef
land
when
i
started
to
take
my
leave
he
seemed
reluctant
to
have
me
go
and
asked
me
to
come
again
although
at
the
time
i
thought
nothing
of
it
i
remember
now
that
he
made
a
peculiar
remark
as
i
extended
my
hand
in
you
will
come
again
he
asked
yes
you
will
come
again
some
day
i
am
sure
you
will
and
i
shall
show
you
my
library
and
tell
you
many
things
of
which
you
have
never
dreamed
things
so
wonderful
that
it
may
be
you
will
not
believe
me
i
laughingly
assured
him
that
i
would
not
only
come
again
but
would
be
ready
to
believe
whatever
he
might
choose
to
tell
me
of
his
travels
and
adventures
in
the
days
that
followed
i
became
well
acquainted
with
olaf
jansen
and
little
by
little
he
told
me
his
story
so
marvelous
that
its
very
daring
challenges
reason
and
belief
the
old
norseman
always
expressed
himself
with
so
much
earnestness
and
sincerity
that
i
became
enthralled
by
his
strange
narrations
then
came
the
messenger
call
that
night
and
within
the
hour
i
was
at
olaf
jansen
bungalow
he
was
very
impatient
at
the
long
wait
although
after
being
summoned
i
had
come
immediately
to
his
bedside
i
must
hasten
he
exclaimed
while
yet
he
held
my
hand
in
greeting
i
have
much
to
tell
you
that
you
know
not
and
i
will
trust
no
one
but
you
i
fully
realize
he
went
on
hurriedly
that
i
shall
not
survive
the
night
the
time
has
come
to
join
my
fathers
in
the
great
sleep
i
adjusted
the
pillows
to
make
him
more
comfortable
and
assured
him
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
serve
him
in
any
way
possible
for
i
was
beginning
to
realize
the
seriousness
of
his
condition
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
stillness
of
the
surroundings
the
uncanny
feeling
of
being
alone
with
the
dying
man
together
with
his
weird
story
all
combined
to
make
my
heart
beat
fast
and
loud
with
a
feeling
for
which
i
have
no
name
indeed
there
were
many
times
that
night
by
the
old
norseman
couch
and
there
have
been
many
times
since
when
a
sensation
rather
than
a
conviction
took
possession
of
my
very
soul
and
i
seemed
not
only
to
believe
in
but
actually
see
the
strange
lands
the
strange
people
and
the
strange
world
of
which
he
told
and
to
hear
the
mighty
orchestral
chorus
of
a
thousand
lusty
voices
for
over
two
hours
he
seemed
endowed
with
almost
superhuman
strength
talking
rapidly
and
to
all
appearances
rationally
finally
he
gave
into
my
hands
certain
data
drawings
and
crude
maps
these
said
he
in
conclusion
i
leave
in
your
hands
if
i
can
have
your
promise
to
give
them
to
the
world
i
shall
die
happy
because
i
desire
that
people
may
know
the
truth
for
then
all
mystery
concerning
the
frozen
northland
will
be
explained
there
is
no
chance
of
your
suffering
the
fate
i
suffered
they
will
not
put
you
in
irons
nor
confine
you
in
a
because
you
are
not
telling
your
own
story
but
mine
and
i
thanks
to
the
gods
odin
and
thor
will
be
in
my
grave
and
so
beyond
the
reach
of
disbelievers
who
would
persecute
without
a
thought
of
the
farreaching
results
the
promise
entailed
or
foreseeing
the
many
sleepless
nights
which
the
obligation
has
since
brought
me
i
gave
my
hand
and
with
it
a
pledge
to
discharge
faithfully
his
dying
wish
as
the
sun
rose
over
the
peaks
of
the
san
jacinto
far
to
the
eastward
the
spirit
of
olaf
jansen
the
navigator
the
explorer
and
worshiper
of
odin
and
thor
the
man
whose
experiences
and
travels
as
related
are
without
a
parallel
in
all
the
world
history
passed
away
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
dead
and
now
after
having
paid
the
last
sad
rites
to
this
strange
man
from
the
lofoden
islands
and
the
still
farther
northward
ho
the
courageous
explorer
of
frozen
regions
who
in
his
declining
years
after
he
had
passed
the
mark
had
sought
an
asylum
of
restful
peace
in
california
i
will
undertake
to
make
public
his
story
but
first
of
all
let
me
indulge
in
one
or
two
reflections
generation
follows
generation
and
the
traditions
from
the
misty
past
are
handed
down
from
sire
to
son
but
for
some
strange
reason
interest
in
the
unknown
does
not
abate
with
the
receding
years
either
in
the
minds
of
the
ignorant
or
the
tutored
with
each
new
generation
a
restless
impulse
stirs
the
hearts
of
men
to
capture
the
veiled
citadel
of
the
arctic
the
circle
of
silence
the
land
of
glaciers
cold
wastes
of
waters
and
winds
that
are
strangely
warm
increasing
interest
is
manifested
in
the
mountainous
icebergs
and
marvelous
speculations
are
indulged
in
concerning
the
earth
center
of
gravity
the
cradle
of
the
tides
where
the
whales
have
their
nurseries
where
the
magnetic
needle
goes
mad
where
the
aurora
borealis
illumines
the
night
and
where
brave
and
courageous
spirits
of
every
generation
dare
to
venture
and
explore
defying
the
dangers
of
the
farthest
north
one
of
the
ablest
works
of
recent
years
is
paradise
found
or
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
at
the
north
pole
by
william
warren
in
his
carefully
prepared
volume
warren
almost
stubbed
his
toe
against
the
real
truth
but
missed
it
seemingly
by
only
a
hair
breadth
if
the
old
norseman
revelation
be
true
orville
livingston
leech
scientist
in
a
recent
article
says
the
possibilities
of
a
land
inside
the
earth
were
first
brought
to
my
attention
when
i
picked
up
a
geode
on
the
shores
of
the
great
lakes
the
geode
is
a
spherical
and
apparently
solid
stone
but
when
broken
is
found
to
be
hollow
and
coated
with
crystals
the
earth
is
only
a
larger
form
of
a
geode
and
the
law
that
created
the
geode
in
its
hollow
form
undoubtedly
fashioned
the
earth
in
the
same
way
in
presenting
the
theme
of
this
almost
incredible
story
as
told
by
olaf
jansen
and
supplemented
by
manuscript
maps
and
crude
drawings
entrusted
to
me
a
fitting
introduction
is
found
in
the
following
quotation
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
also
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
therefore
even
in
things
material
man
must
be
because
he
is
created
in
the
likeness
of
the
father
a
man
builds
a
house
for
himself
and
family
the
porches
or
verandas
are
all
without
and
are
secondary
the
building
is
really
constructed
for
the
conveniences
within
olaf
jansen
makes
the
startling
announcement
through
me
an
humble
instrument
that
in
like
manner
god
created
the
earth
for
the
within
that
is
to
say
for
its
lands
seas
rivers
mountains
forests
and
valleys
and
for
its
other
internal
conveniences
while
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
is
merely
the
veranda
the
porch
where
things
grow
by
comparison
but
sparsely
like
the
lichen
on
the
mountain
side
clinging
determinedly
for
bare
existence
take
an
and
from
each
end
break
out
a
piece
as
large
as
the
end
of
this
pencil
extract
its
contents
and
then
you
will
have
a
perfect
representation
of
olaf
jansen
earth
the
distance
from
the
inside
surface
to
the
outside
surface
according
to
him
is
about
three
hundred
miles
the
center
of
gravity
is
not
in
the
center
of
the
earth
but
in
the
center
of
the
shell
or
crust
therefore
if
the
thickness
of
the
earth
crust
or
shell
is
three
hundred
miles
the
center
of
gravity
is
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
the
surface
in
their
arctic
explorers
tell
us
of
the
dipping
of
the
needle
as
the
vessel
sails
in
regions
of
the
farthest
north
known
in
reality
they
are
at
the
curve
on
the
edge
of
the
shell
where
gravity
is
geometrically
increased
and
while
the
electric
current
seemingly
dashes
off
into
space
toward
the
phantom
idea
of
the
north
pole
yet
this
same
electric
current
drops
again
and
continues
its
course
southward
along
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth
crust
in
the
appendix
to
his
work
captain
sabine
gives
an
account
of
experiments
to
determine
the
acceleration
of
the
pendulum
in
different
latitudes
this
appears
to
have
resulted
from
the
joint
labor
of
peary
and
sabine
he
says
the
accidental
discovery
that
a
pendulum
on
being
removed
from
paris
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
equator
increased
its
time
of
vibration
gave
the
first
step
to
our
present
knowledge
that
the
polar
axis
of
the
globe
is
less
than
the
equatorial
that
the
force
of
gravity
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
increases
progressively
from
the
equator
toward
the
poles
according
to
olaf
jansen
in
the
beginning
this
old
world
of
ours
was
created
solely
for
the
within
world
where
are
located
the
four
great
rivers
the
euphrates
the
pison
the
gihon
and
the
hiddekel
these
same
names
of
rivers
when
applied
to
streams
on
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
are
purely
traditional
from
an
antiquity
beyond
the
memory
of
man
on
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
near
the
of
these
four
rivers
olaf
jansen
the
norseman
claims
to
have
discovered
the
garden
of
eden
the
veritable
navel
of
the
earth
and
to
have
spent
over
two
years
studying
and
reconnoitering
in
this
marvelous
within
land
exuberant
with
stupendous
plant
life
and
abounding
in
giant
animals
a
land
where
the
people
live
to
be
centuries
old
after
the
order
of

of

the

directly
across

less

is
the

a
mammoth
ball
of
dull
red
fire
not
startlingly
brilliant
but
surrounded
by
a
white
mild
luminous

out
uniform
warmth
and
held
in
its
place
in
the

this

is
known
to

as
the
abode
of
the
smoky
god
they
believe
it
to
be
the
throne
of
the
most
high
olaf
jansen
reminded
me
of
how
in
the
old
college
days
we
were
all
familiar
with
the
laboratory
demonstrations
of
centrifugal
motion
which
clearly
proved
that
if
the
earth
were
a
solid
the
rapidity
of
its
revolution
upon
its
axis
would
tear
it
into
a
thousand
fragments
the
old
norseman
also
maintained
that
from
the
farthest
points
of
land
on
the
islands
of
spitzbergen
and
franz
josef
land
flocks
of
geese
may
be
seen
annually
flying
still
farther
northward
just
as
the
sailors
and
explorers
record
in
their
no
scientist
has
yet
been
audacious
enough
to
attempt
to
explain
even
to
his
own
satisfaction
toward
what
lands
these
winged
fowls
are
guided
by
their
subtle
instinct
however
olaf
jansen
has
given
us
a
most
reasonable
explanation
the
presence
of
the
open
sea
in
the
northland
is
also
explained
olaf
jansen
claims
that
the
northern
aperture
intake
or
hole
so
to
speak
is
about
fourteen
hundred
miles
across
in
connection
with
this
let
us
read
what
explorer
nansen
writes
on
page
of
his
book
i
have
never
had
such
a
splendid
sail
on
to
the
north
steadily
north
with
a
good
wind
as
fast
as
steam
and
sail
can
take
us
an
open
sea
mile
after
mile
watch
after
watch
through
these
unknown
regions
always
clearer
and
clearer
of
ice
one
might
almost
say
long
will
it
last
the
eye
always
turns
to
the
northward
as
one
paces
the
bridge
it
is
gazing
into
the
future
but
there
is
always
the
same
dark
sky
ahead
which
means
open
sea
again
the
norwood
review
of
england
in
its
issue
of
may
says
we
do
not
admit
that
there
is
ice
up
to
the
pole
once
inside
the
great
ice
barrier
a
new
world
breaks
upon
the
explorer
the
climate
is
mild
like
that
of
england
and
afterward
balmy
as
the
greek
isles
some
of
the
rivers
within
olaf
jansen
claims
are
larger
than
our
mississippi
and
amazon
rivers
combined
in
point
of
volume
of
water
carried
indeed
their
greatness
is
occasioned
by
their
width
and
depth
rather
than
their
length
and
it
is
at
the
mouths
of
these
mighty
rivers
as
they
flow
northward
and
southward
along
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth
that
mammoth
icebergs
are
found
some
of
them
fifteen
and
twenty
miles
wide
and
from
forty
to
one
hundred
miles
in
length
is
it
not
strange
that
there
has
never
been
an
iceberg
encountered
either
in
the
arctic
or
antarctic
ocean
that
is
not
composed
of
fresh
water
modern
scientists
claim
that
freezing
eliminates
the
salt
but
olaf
jansen
claims
differently
ancient
hindoo
japanese
and
chinese
writings
as
well
as
the
hieroglyphics
of
the
extinct
races
of
the
north
american
continent
all
speak
of
the
custom
of
and
it
is
possible
in
the
startling
light
of
olaf
jansen
revelations
that
the
people
of
the
inner
world
lured
away
by
glimpses
of
the
sun
as
it
shone
upon
the
inner
surface
of
the
earth
either
from
the
northern
or
the
southern
opening
became
dissatisfied
with
the
smoky
god
the
great
pillar
or
mother
cloud
of
electricity
and
weary
of
their
continuously
mild
and
pleasant
atmosphere
followed
the
brighter
light
and
were
finally
led
beyond
the
ice
belt
and
scattered
over
the
outer
surface
of
the
earth
through
asia
europe
north
america
and
later
africa
australia
and
south
america
the
following
quotation
is
significant

from
a
still
undetermined
but
which
a
number
of
considerations
indicate

it
is
a
notable
fact
that
as
we
approach
the
equator
the
stature
of
the
human
race
grows
less
but
the
patagonians
of
south
america
are
probably
the
only
aborigines

in

the

was
created
by

that
man
might

the

a
narrative
suggesting
the
story
of

we
are
familiar
he
sailed
away

was
never

still
more
frequently
on

coast
are
found
boneyards
containing
tusks
of

in
quantities
so
great
as
to

of

account
they
have
come
from
the
great
prolific
animal
life
that
abounds
in
the
fields
and
forests
and
on
the
banks
of
numerous
rivers
of
the
inner
world
the
materials
were
caught
in
the
ocean
currents
or
were
carried
on
and
have
accumulated
like
driftwood
on
the
siberian
coast
this
has
been
going
on
for
ages
and
hence
these
mysterious
on
this
subject
william

in
his
book
already
cited
pages
and
says
the
arctic
rocks
tell
of

more
wonderful
than

the
fossil
ivory
beds
of
siberia
excel
everything
of
the
kind
in
the
world
from
the
days
of
pliny
at
least
they
have
constantly
been
undergoing
exploitation
and
still
they
are
the
chief
headquarters
of

the
remains
of
mammoths
are
so
abundant
that
as
gratacap
says
northern
islands
of

seem
built
up
of
crowded

another
scientific
writer
speaking
of
the
islands
of

northward
of

of

uses
this
language
quantities
of
ivory
are
dug
out
of
the
ground
every
year
indeed
some
of
the
islands
are
believed
to
be
nothing
but
an
accumulation
of
and
the
bodies
of
mammoths
and
other
antediluvian
animals
frozen
together
from
this
we
may
infer
that
during
the
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
russian
conquest
of
siberia
useful
tusks
from
more
than
twenty
thousand
mammoths
have
been
collected
but
now
for
the
story
of
olaf
jansen
i
give
it
in
detail
as
set
down
by
himself
in
manuscript
and
woven
into
the
tale
just
as
he
placed
them
are
certain
quotations
from
recent
works
on
arctic
exploration
showing
how
carefully
the
old
norseman
compared
with
his
own
experiences
those
of
other
voyagers
to
the
frozen
north
thus
wrote
the
disciple
of
odin
and
thor
part
two
olaf
jansen
story
my
name
is
olaf
jansen
i
am
a
norwegian
although
i
was
born
in
the
little
seafaring
russian
town
of
uleaborg
on
the
eastern
coast
of
the
gulf
of
bothnia
the
northern
arm
of
the
baltic
sea
my
parents
were
on
a
fishing
cruise
in
the
gulf
of
bothnia
and
put
into
this
russian
town
of
uleaborg
at
the
time
of
my
birth
being
the
day
of
october
my
father
jens
jansen
was
born
at
rodwig
on
the
scandinavian
coast
near
the
lofoden
islands
but
after
marrying
made
his
home
at
stockholm
because
my
mother
people
resided
in
that
city
when
seven
years
old
i
began
going
with
my
father
on
his
fishing
trips
along
the
scandinavian
coast
early
in
life
i
displayed
an
aptitude
for
books
and
at
the
age
of
nine
years
was
placed
in
a
private
school
in
stockholm
remaining
there
until
i
was
fourteen
after
this
i
made
regular
trips
with
my
father
on
all
his
fishing
voyages
my
father
was
a
man
fully
six
feet
three
in
height
and
weighed
over
fifteen
stone
a
typical
norseman
of
the
most
rugged
sort
and
capable
of
more
endurance
than
any
other
man
i
have
ever
known
he
possessed
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
in
tender
little
ways
yet
his
determination
and
were
beyond
description
his
will
admitted
of
no
defeat
i
was
in
my
nineteenth
year
when
we
started
on
what
proved
to
be
our
last
trip
as
fishermen
and
which
resulted
in
the
strange
story
that
shall
be
given
to
the
world
but
not
until
i
have
finished
my
earthly
pilgrimage
i
dare
not
allow
the
facts
as
i
know
them
to
be
published
while
i
am
living
for
fear
of
further
humiliation
confinement
and
suffering
first
of
all
i
was
put
in
irons
by
the
captain
of
the
whaling
vessel
that
rescued
me
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
told
the
truth
about
the
marvelous
discoveries
made
by
my
father
and
myself
but
this
was
far
from
being
the
end
of
my
tortures
after
four
years
and
eight
months
absence
i
reached
stockholm
only
to
find
my
mother
had
died
the
previous
year
and
the
property
left
by
my
parents
in
the
possession
of
my
mother
people
but
it
was
at
once
made
over
to
me
all
might
have
been
well
had
i
erased
from
my
memory
the
story
of
our
adventure
and
of
my
father
terrible
death
finally
one
day
i
told
the
story
in
detail
to
my
uncle
gustaf
osterlind
a
man
of
considerable
property
and
urged
him
to
fit
out
an
expedition
for
me
to
make
another
voyage
to
the
strange
land
at
first
i
thought
he
favored
my
project
he
seemed
interested
and
invited
me
to
go
before
certain
officials
and
explain
to
them
as
i
had
to
him
the
story
of
our
travels
and
discoveries
imagine
my
disappointment
and
horror
when
upon
the
conclusion
of
my
narrative
certain
papers
were
signed
by
my
uncle
and
without
warning
i
found
myself
arrested
and
hurried
away
to
dismal
and
fearful
confinement
in
a
madhouse
where
i
remained
for
years
long
tedious
frightful
years
of
suffering
i
never
ceased
to
assert
my
sanity
and
to
protest
against
the
injustice
of
my
confinement
finally
on
the
seventeenth
of
october
i
was
released
my
uncle
was
dead
and
the
friends
of
my
youth
were
now
strangers
indeed
a
man
over
fifty
years
old
whose
only
known
record
is
that
of
a
madman
has
no
friends
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
for
a
living
but
instinctively
turned
toward
the
harbor
where
fishing
boats
in
great
numbers
were
anchored
and
within
a
week
i
had
shipped
with
a
fisherman
by
the
name
of
yan
hansen
who
was
starting
on
a
long
fishing
cruise
to
the
lofoden
islands
here
my
earlier
years
of
training
proved
of
the
very
greatest
advantage
especially
in
enabling
me
to
make
myself
useful
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
other
trips
and
by
frugal
economy
i
was
in
a
few
years
able
to
own
a
of
my
own
for
years
thereafter
i
followed
the
sea
as
a
fisherman
five
years
working
for
others
and
the
last
for
myself
during
all
these
years
i
was
a
most
diligent
student
of
books
as
well
as
a
hard
worker
at
my
business
but
i
took
great
care
not
to
mention
to
anyone
the
story
concerning
the
discoveries
made
by
my
father
and
myself
even
at
this
late
day
i
would
be
fearful
of
having
any
one
see
or
know
the
things
i
am
writing
and
the
records
and
maps
i
have
in
my
keeping
when
my
days
on
earth
are
finished
i
shall
leave
maps
and
records
that
will
enlighten
and
i
hope
benefit
mankind
the
memory
of
my
long
confinement
with
maniacs
and
all
the
horrible
anguish
and
sufferings
are
too
vivid
to
warrant
my
taking
further
chances
in
i
sold
out
my
fishing
boats
and
found
i
had
accumulated
a
fortune
quite
sufficient
to
keep
me
the
remainder
of
my
life
i
then
came
to
america
for
a
dozen
years
my
home
was
in
illinois
near
batavia
where
i
gathered
most
of
the
books
in
my
present
library
though
i
brought
many
choice
volumes
from
stockholm
later
i
came
to
los
angeles
arriving
here
march
the
date
i
well
remember
as
it
was
president
mckinley
second
inauguration
day
i
bought
this
humble
home
and
determined
here
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
abode
sheltered
by
my
own
vine
and
and
with
my
books
about
me
to
make
maps
and
drawings
of
the
new
lands
we
had
discovered
and
also
to
write
the
story
in
detail
from
the
time
my
father
and
i
left
stockholm
until
the
tragic
event
that
parted
us
in
the
antarctic
ocean
i
well
remember
that
we
left
stockholm
in
our
on
the
third
day
of
april
and
sailed
to
the
southward
leaving
gothland
island
to
the
left
and
oeland
island
to
the
right
a
few
days
later
we
succeeded
in
doubling
sandhommar
point
and
made
our
way
through
the
sound
which
separates
denmark
from
the
scandinavian
coast
in
due
time
we
put
in
at
the
town
of
christiansand
where
we
rested
two
days
and
then
started
around
the
scandinavian
coast
to
the
westward
bound
for
the
lofoden
islands
my
father
was
in
high
spirit
because
of
the
excellent
and
gratifying
returns
he
had
received
from
our
last
catch
by
marketing
at
stockholm
instead
of
selling
at
one
of
the
seafaring
towns
along
the
scandinavian
coast
he
was
especially
pleased
with
the
sale
of
some
ivory
tusks
that
he
had
found
on
the
west
coast
of
franz
joseph
land
during
one
of
his
northern
cruises
the
previous
year
and
he
expressed
the
hope
that
this
time
we
might
again
be
fortunate
enough
to
load
our
little
with
ivory
instead
of
cod
herring
mackerel
and
salmon
we
put
in
at
hammerfest
latitude
degrees
and
forty
minutes
for
a
few
days
rest
here
we
remained
one
week
laying
in
an
extra
supply
of
provisions
and
several
casks
of
and
then
sailed
toward
spitzbergen
for
the
first
few
days
we
had
an
open
sea
and
a
favoring
wind
and
then
we
encountered
much
ice
and
many
icebergs
a
vessel
larger
than
our
little
could
not
possibly
have
threaded
its
way
among
the
labyrinth
of
icebergs
or
squeezed
through
the
barely
open
channels
these
monster
bergs
presented
an
endless
succession
of
crystal
palaces
of
massive
cathedrals
and
fantastic
mountain
ranges
grim
and
immovable
as
some
towering
cliff
of
solid
rock
standing
silent
as
a
sphinx
resisting
the
restless
waves
of
a
fretful
sea
after
many
narrow
escapes
we
arrived
at
spitzbergen
on
the
of
june
and
anchored
at
wijade
bay
for
a
short
time
where
we
were
quite
successful
in
our
catches
we
then
lifted
anchor
and
sailed
through
the
hinlopen
strait
and
coasted
along
the
it
will
be
remembered
that
andree
started
on
his
fatal
balloon
voyage
from
the
northwest
coast
of
spitzbergen
a
strong
wind
came
up
from
the
southwest
and
my
father
said
that
we
had
better
take
advantage
of
it
and
try
to
reach
franz
josef
land
where
the
year
before
he
had
by
accident
found
the
ivory
tusks
that
had
brought
him
such
a
good
price
at
stockholm
never
before
or
since
have
i
seen
so
many
they
were
so
numerous
that
they
hid
the
rocks
on
the
coast
line
and
darkened
the
sky
for
several
days
we
sailed
along
the
rocky
coast
of
franz
josef
land
finally
a
favoring
wind
came
up
that
enabled
us
to
make
the
west
coast
and
after
sailing
hours
we
came
to
a
beautiful
inlet
one
could
hardly
believe
it
was
the
far
northland
the
place
was
green
with
growing
vegetation
and
while
the
area
did
not
comprise
more
than
one
or
two
acres
yet
the
air
was
warm
and
tranquil
it
seemed
to
be
at
that
point
where
the
gulf
stream
influence
is
most
keenly
felt

beechey
refers
to
what
has
frequently
been
found
and
noticed
the
mildness
of
the
temperature
on
the
western
coast
of
spitzbergen
there
being
little
or
no
sensation
of
cold
though
the
thermometer
might
be
only
a
few
degrees
above
the
the
brilliant
and
lively
effect
of
a
clear
day
when
the
sun
shines
forth
with
a
pure
sky
whose
azure
hue
is
so
intense
as
to
find
no
parallel
even
in
the
boasted
italian
sky
on
the
east
coast
there
were
numerous
icebergs
yet
here
we
were
in
open
water
far
to
the
west
of
us
however
were
icepacks
and
still
farther
to
the
westward
the
ice
appeared
like
ranges
of
low
hills
in
front
of
us
and
directly
to
the
north
lay
an
open
sea
captain
kane
on
page
quoting
from
morton
journal
on
monday
the
of
december
says
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
open
passages
were
fifteen
miles
or
more
wide
with
sometimes
mashed
ice
separating
them
but
it
is
all
small
ice
and
i
think
it
either
drives
out
to
the
open
space
to
the
north
or
rots
and
sinks
as
i
could
see
none
ahead
to
the
north
my
father
was
an
ardent
believer
in
odin
and
thor
and
had
frequently
told
me
they
were
gods
who
came
from
far
beyond
the
north
wind
there
was
a
tradition
my
father
explained
that
still
farther
northward
was
a
land
more
beautiful
than
any
that
mortal
man
had
ever
known
and
that
it
was
inhabited
by
the
chosen
we
find
the
following
in
deutsche
mythologie
page
from
the
pen
of
jakob
grimm
then
the
sons
of
bor
built
in
the
middle
of
the
universe
the
city
called
asgard
where
dwell
the
gods
and
their
kindred
and
from
that
abode
work
out
so
many
wondrous
things
both
on
the
earth
and
in
the
heavens
above
it
there
is
in
that
city
a
place
called
illidskjalf
and
when
odin
is
seated
there
upon
his
lofty
throne
he
sees
over
the
whole
world
and
discerns
all
the
actions
of
men
my
youthful
imagination
was
fired
by
the
ardor
zeal
and
religious
fervor
of
my
good
father
and
i
exclaimed
why
not
sail
to
this
goodly
land
the
sky
is
fair
the
wind
favorable
and
the
sea
open
even
now
i
can
see
the
expression
of
pleasurable
surprise
on
his
countenance
as
he
turned
toward
me
and
asked
my
son
are
you
willing
to
go
with
me
and
explore
to
go
far
beyond
where
man
has
ever
ventured
i
answered
affirmatively
very
well
he
replied
may
the
god
odin
protect
us
and
quickly
adjusting
the
sails
he
glanced
at
our
compass
turned
the
prow
in
due
northerly
direction
through
an
open
channel
and
our
voyage
had
begun
hall
writes
on
page
on
the
of
january
the
two
esquimaux
accompanied
by
two
of
the
seamen
went
to
cape
lupton
they
reported
a
sea
of
open
water
extending
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
sun
was
low
in
the
horizon
as
it
was
still
the
early
summer
indeed
we
had
almost
four
months
of
day
ahead
of
us
before
the
frozen
night
could
come
on
again
our
little
sprang
forward
as
if
eager
as
ourselves
for
adventure
within
hours
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
highest
point
on
the
coast
line
of
franz
josef
land
we
seemed
to
be
in
a
strong
current
running
north
by
northeast
far
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
of
us
were
icebergs
but
our
little
sloop
bore
down
on
the
narrows
and
passed
through
channels
and
out
into
open
seas
channels
so
narrow
in
places
that
had
our
craft
been
other
than
small
we
never
could
have
gotten
through
on
the
third
day
we
came
to
an
island
its
shores
were
washed
by
an
open
sea
my
father
determined
to
land
and
explore
for
a
day
this
new
land
was
destitute
of
timber
but
we
found
a
large
accumulation
of
on
the
northern
shore
some
of
the
trunks
of
the
trees
were
forty
feet
long
and
two
feet
in
diameter
greely
tells
us
in
vol
page
that
privates
connell
and
frederick
found
a
large
coniferous
tree
on
the
beach
just
above
the
extreme
mark
it
was
nearly
thirty
inches
in
circumference
some
thirty
feet
long
and
had
apparently
been
carried
to
that
point
by
a
current
within
a
couple
of
years
a
portion
of
it
was
cut
up
for
and
for
the
first
time
in
that
valley
a
bright
cheery
gave
comfort
to
man
after
one
day
exploration
of
the
coast
line
of
this
island
we
lifted
anchor
and
turned
our
prow
to
the
north
in
an
open
sea
kane
says
on
page
of
his
works
i
can
not
imagine
what
becomes
of
the
ice
a
strong
current
sets
in
constantly
to
the
north
but
from
altitudes
of
more
than
five
hundred
feet
i
saw
only
narrow
strips
of
ice
with
great
spaces
of
open
water
from
ten
to
fifteen
miles
in
breadth
between
them
it
must
therefore
either
go
to
an
open
space
in
the
north
or
dissolve
i
remember
that
neither
my
father
nor
myself
had
tasted
food
for
almost
thirty
hours
perhaps
this
was
because
of
the
tension
of
excitement
about
our
strange
voyage
in
waters
farther
north
my
father
said
than
anyone
had
ever
before
been
active
mentality
had
dulled
the
demands
of
the
physical
needs
instead
of
the
cold
being
intense
as
we
had
anticipated
it
was
really
warmer
and
more
pleasant
than
it
had
been
while
in
hammerfest
on
the
north
coast
of
norway
some
six
weeks
before
captain
peary
second
voyage
relates
another
circumstance
which
may
serve
to
confirm
a
conjecture
which
has
long
been
maintained
by
some
that
an
open
sea
free
of
ice
exists
at
or
near
the
pole
on
the
second
of
november
says
peary
the
wind
freshened
up
to
a
gale
from
north
by
west
lowered
the
thermometer
before
midnight
to
degrees
whereas
a
rise
of
wind
at
melville
island
was
generally
accompanied
by
a
simultaneous
rise
in
the
thermometer
at
low
temperatures
may
not
this
he
asks
be
occasioned
by
the
wind
blowing
over
an
open
sea
in
the
quarter
from
which
the
wind
blows
and
tend
to
confirm
the
opinion
that
at
or
near
the
pole
an
open
sea
exists
we
both
frankly
admitted
that
we
were
very
hungry
and
forthwith
i
prepared
a
substantial
meal
from
our
larder
when
we
had
partaken
heartily
of
the
repast
i
told
my
father
i
believed
i
would
sleep
as
i
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
drowsy
very
well
he
replied
i
will
keep
the
watch
i
have
no
way
to
determine
how
long
i
slept
i
only
know
that
i
was
rudely
awakened
by
a
terrible
commotion
of
the
sloop
to
my
surprise
i
found
my
father
sleeping
soundly
i
cried
out
lustily
to
him
and
starting
up
he
sprang
quickly
to
his
feet
indeed
had
he
not
instantly
clutched
the
rail
he
would
certainly
have
been
thrown
into
the
seething
waves
a
fierce
was
raging
the
wind
was
directly
astern
driving
our
sloop
at
a
terrific
speed
and
was
threatening
every
moment
to
capsize
us
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
sails
had
to
be
lowered
immediately
our
boat
was
writhing
in
convulsions
a
few
icebergs
we
knew
were
on
either
side
of
us
but
fortunately
the
channel
was
open
directly
to
the
north
but
would
it
remain
so
in
front
of
us
girding
the
horizon
from
left
to
right
was
a
vaporish
fog
or
mist
black
as
egyptian
night
at
the
water
edge
and
white
like
a
toward
the
top
which
was
finally
lost
to
view
as
it
blended
with
the
great
white
flakes
of
falling
snow
whether
it
covered
a
treacherous
iceberg
or
some
other
hidden
obstacle
against
which
our
little
sloop
would
dash
and
send
us
to
a
watery
grave
or
was
merely
the
phenomenon
of
an
arctic
fog
there
was
no
way
to
determine
on
page
of
his
works
hall
writes
from
the
top
of
providence
berg
a
dark
fog
was
seen
to
the
north
indicating
water
at
three
of
the
men
kruger
nindemann
and
hobby
went
to
cape
lupton
to
ascertain
if
possible
the
extent
of
the
open
water
on
their
return
they
reported
several
open
spaces
and
much
young
ice
not
more
than
a
day
old
so
thin
that
it
was
easily
broken
by
throwing
pieces
of
ice
upon
it
by
what
miracle
we
escaped
being
dashed
to
utter
destruction
i
do
not
know
i
remember
our
little
craft
creaked
and
groaned
as
if
its
joints
were
breaking
it
rocked
and
staggered
to
and
fro
as
if
clutched
by
some
fierce
undertow
of
whirlpool
or
maelstrom
fortunately
our
compass
had
been
fastened
with
long
screws
to
a
crossbeam
most
of
our
provisions
however
were
tumbled
out
and
swept
away
from
the
deck
of
the
cuddy
and
had
we
not
taken
the
precaution
at
the
very
beginning
to
tie
ourselves
firmly
to
the
masts
of
the
sloop
we
should
have
been
swept
into
the
lashing
sea
above
the
deafening
tumult
of
the
raging
waves
i
heard
my
voice
be
courageous
my
son
he
shouted
odin
is
the
god
of
the
waters
the
companion
of
the
brave
and
he
is
with
us
fear
not
to
me
it
seemed
there
was
no
possibility
of
our
escaping
a
horrible
death
the
little
sloop
was
shipping
water
the
snow
was
falling
so
fast
as
to
be
blinding
and
the
waves
were
tumbling
over
our
counters
in
reckless
fury
there
was
no
telling
what
instant
we
should
be
dashed
against
some
drifting
the
tremendous
swells
would
heave
us
up
to
the
very
peaks
of
mountainous
waves
then
plunge
us
down
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
trough
as
if
our
were
a
fragile
shell
gigantic
waves
like
veritable
walls
fenced
us
in
fore
and
aft
this
terrible
ordeal
with
its
nameless
horrors
of
suspense
and
agony
of
fear
indescribable
continued
for
more
than
three
hours
and
all
the
time
we
were
being
driven
forward
at
fierce
speed
then
suddenly
as
if
growing
weary
of
its
frantic
exertions
the
wind
began
to
lessen
its
fury
and
by
degrees
to
die
down
at
last
we
were
in
a
perfect
calm
the
fog
mist
had
also
disappeared
and
before
us
lay
an
iceless
channel
perhaps
ten
or
fifteen
miles
wide
with
a
few
icebergs
far
away
to
our
right
and
an
intermittent
archipelago
of
smaller
ones
to
the
left
i
watched
my
father
closely
determined
to
remain
silent
until
he
spoke
presently
he
untied
the
rope
from
his
waist
and
without
saying
a
word
began
working
the
pumps
which
fortunately
were
not
damaged
relieving
the
sloop
of
the
water
it
had
shipped
in
the
madness
of
the
storm
he
put
up
the
sloop
sails
as
calmly
as
if
casting
a
and
then
remarked
that
we
were
ready
for
a
favoring
wind
when
it
came
his
courage
and
persistence
were
truly
remarkable
on
investigation
we
found
less
than
of
our
provisions
remaining
while
to
our
utter
dismay
we
discovered
that
our
had
been
swept
overboard
during
the
violent
plungings
of
our
boat
two
of
our
were
in
the
main
hold
but
both
were
empty
we
had
a
fair
supply
of
food
but
no
fresh
water
i
realized
at
once
the
awfulness
of
our
position
presently
i
was
seized
with
a
consuming
thirst
it
is
indeed
bad
remarked
my
father
however
let
us
dry
our
bedraggled
clothing
for
we
are
soaked
to
the
skin
trust
to
the
god
odin
my
son
do
not
give
up
hope
the
sun
was
beating
down
slantingly
as
if
we
were
in
a
southern
latitude
instead
of
in
the
far
northland
it
was
swinging
around
its
orbit
ever
visible
and
rising
higher
and
higher
each
day
frequently
yet
always
peering
through
the
lacework
of
clouds
like
some
fretful
eye
of
fate
guarding
the
mysterious
northland
and
jealously
watching
the
pranks
of
man
far
to
our
right
the
rays
decking
the
prisms
of
icebergs
were
gorgeous
their
reflections
emitted
flashes
of
garnet
of
diamond
of
sapphire
a
pyrotechnic
panorama
of
countless
colors
and
shapes
while
below
could
be
seen
the
sea
and
above
the
purple
sky
part
three
beyond
the
north
wind
i
tried
to
forget
my
thirst
by
busying
myself
with
bringing
up
some
food
and
an
empty
vessel
from
the
hold
reaching
over
the
i
filled
the
vessel
with
water
for
the
purpose
of
laving
my
hands
and
face
to
my
astonishment
when
the
water
came
in
contact
with
my
lips
i
could
taste
no
salt
i
was
startled
by
the
discovery
father
i
fairly
gasped
the
water
the
water
it
is
fresh
what
olaf
exclaimed
my
father
glancing
hastily
around
surely
you
are
mistaken
there
is
no
land
you
are
going
mad
but
taste
it
i
cried
and
thus
we
made
the
discovery
that
the
water
was
indeed
fresh
absolutely
so
without
the
least
briny
taste
or
even
the
suspicion
of
a
salty
flavor
we
forthwith
filled
our
two
remaining
and
my
father
declared
it
was
a
heavenly
dispensation
of
mercy
from
the
gods
odin
and
thor
we
were
almost
beside
ourselves
with
joy
but
hunger
bade
us
end
our
enforced
fast
now
that
we
had
found
fresh
water
in
the
open
sea
what
might
we
not
expect
in
this
strange
latitude
where
ship
had
never
before
sailed
and
the
splash
of
an
oar
had
never
been
heard
in
vol
i
page
nansen
writes
it
is
a
peculiar
phenomenon
this
dead
water
we
had
at
present
a
better
opportunity
of
studying
it
than
we
desired
it
occurs
where
a
surface
layer
of
fresh
water
rests
upon
the
salt
water
of
the
sea
and
this
fresh
water
is
carried
along
with
the
ship
gliding
on
the
heavier
sea
beneath
it
as
if
on
a
fixed
foundation
the
difference
between
the
two
strata
was
in
this
case
so
great
that
while
we
had
drinking
water
on
the
surface
the
water
we
got
from
the
bottom
cock
of
the
was
far
too
salt
to
be
used
for
the
boiler
we
had
scarcely
appeased
our
hunger
when
a
breeze
began
filling
the
idle
sails
and
glancing
at
the
compass
we
found
the
northern
point
pressing
hard
against
the
glass
in
response
to
my
surprise
my
father
said
i
have
heard
of
this
before
it
is
what
they
call
the
dipping
of
the
needle
we
loosened
the
compass
and
turned
it
at
right
angles
with
the
surface
of
the
sea
before
its
point
would
free
itself
from
the
glass
and
point
according
to
unmolested
attraction
it
shifted
uneasily
and
seemed
as
unsteady
as
a
drunken
man
but
finally
pointed
a
course
before
this
we
thought
the
wind
was
carrying
us
north
by
northwest
but
with
the
needle
free
we
discovered
if
it
could
be
relied
upon
that
we
were
sailing
slightly
north
by
northeast
our
course
however
was
ever
tending
northward
in

was
very
sluggish
and
both
this
and
its
deviation
increased
as
they
progressed
to
the
westward
and
continued
to
do
so
in
descending
this
inlet
having
reached
latitude
degrees
they
witnessed
for
the
first
time
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
directive
power
of
the
needle
becoming
so
weak
as
to
be
completely
overcome
by
the
attraction
of
the
ship
so
that
the
needle
might
now
be
said
to
point
to
the
north
pole
of
the
ship
the
sea
was
serenely
smooth
with
hardly
a
choppy
wave
and
the
wind
brisk
and
exhilarating
the
sun
rays
while
striking
us
aslant
furnished
tranquil
warmth
and
thus
time
wore
on
day
after
day
and
we
found
from
the
record
in
our
logbook
we
had
been
sailing
eleven
days
since
the
storm
in
the
open
sea
by
strictest
economy
our
food
was
holding
out
fairly
well
but
beginning
to
run
low
in
the
meantime
one
of
our
casks
of
water
had
been
exhausted
and
my
father
said
we
will
fill
it
again
but
to
our
dismay
we
found
the
water
was
now
as
salt
as
in
the
region
of
the
lofoden
islands
off
the
coast
of
norway
this
necessitated
our
being
extremely
careful
of
the
remaining
cask
i
found
myself
wanting
to
sleep
much
of
the
time
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
the
exciting
experience
of
sailing
in
unknown
waters
or
the
relaxation
from
the
awful
excitement
incident
to
our
adventure
in
a
storm
at
sea
or
due
to
want
of
food
i
could
not
say
i
frequently
lay
down
on
the
bunker
of
our
little
sloop
and
looked
far
up
into
the
blue
dome
of
the
sky
and
notwithstanding
the
sun
was
shining
far
away
in
the
east
i
always
saw
a
single
star
overhead
for
several
days
when
i
looked
for
this
star
it
was
always
there
directly
above
us
it
was
now
according
to
our
reckoning
about
the
first
of
august
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
was
so
bright
that
i
could
no
longer
see
the
one
lone
star
that
attracted
my
attention
a
few
days
earlier
one
day
about
this
time
my
father
startled
me
by
calling
my
attention
to
a
novel
sight
far
in
front
of
us
almost
at
the
horizon
it
is
a
mock
sun
exclaimed
my
father
i
have
read
of
them
it
is
called
a
reflection
or
mirage
it
will
soon
pass
away
but
this
false
sun
as
we
supposed
it
to
be
did
not
pass
away
for
several
hours
and
while
we
were
unconscious
of
its
emitting
any
rays
of
light
still
there
was
no
time
thereafter
when
we
could
not
sweep
the
horizon
in
front
and
locate
the
illumination
of
the
false
sun
during
a
period
of
at
least
twelve
hours
out
of
every
clouds
and
mists
would
at
times
almost
but
never
entirely
hide
its
location
gradually
it
seemed
to
climb
higher
in
the
horizon
of
the
uncertain
purply
sky
as
we
advanced
it
could
hardly
be
said
to
resemble
the
sun
except
in
its
circular
shape
and
when
not
obscured
by
clouds
or
the
ocean
mists
it
had
a
bronzed
appearance
which
would
change
to
a
white
light
like
a
luminous
cloud
as
if
reflecting
some
greater
light
beyond
we
finally
agreed
in
our
discussion
of
this
smoky
sun
that
whatever
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
it
was
not
a
reflection
of
our
sun
but
a
planet
of
some
sort
a
reality
nansen
on
page
says
another
noteworthy
thing
happened
which
was
that
about
we
saw
the
sun
or
to
be
more
correct
an
image
of
the
sun
for
it
was
only
a
mirage
a
peculiar
impression
was
produced
by
the
sight
of
that
glowing
fire
lit
just
above
the
outermost
edge
of
the
ice
according
to
the
enthusiastic
descriptions
given
by
many
arctic
travelers
of
the
first
appearance
of
this
god
of
life
after
the
long
winter
night
the
impression
ought
to
be
one
of
jubilant
excitement
but
it
was
not
so
in
my
case
we
had
not
expected
to
see
it
for
some
days
yet
so
that
my
feeling
was
rather
one
of
pain
of
disappointment
that
we
must
have
drifted
farther
south
than
we
thought
so
it
was
with
pleasure
i
soon
discovered
that
it
could
not
be
the
sun
itself
the
mirage
was
at
first
a
glowing
red
streak
of
fire
on
the
horizon
later
there
were
two
streaks
the
one
above
the
other
with
a
dark
space
between
and
from
the
maintop
i
could
see
four
or
even
five
such
horizontal
lines
directly
over
one
another
all
of
equal
length
as
if
one
could
only
imagine
a
square
sun
with
horizontal
dark
streaks
across
it
one
day
soon
after
this
i
felt
exceedingly
drowsy
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
but
it
seemed
that
i
was
almost
immediately
aroused
by
my
father
vigorous
shaking
of
me
by
the
shoulder
and
saying
olaf
awaken
there
is
land
in
sight
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
oh
joy
unspeakable
there
far
in
the
distance
yet
directly
in
our
path
were
lands
jutting
boldly
into
the
sea
the
stretched
far
away
to
the
right
of
us
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
all
along
the
sandy
beach
were
waves
breaking
into
choppy
foam
receding
then
going
forward
again
ever
chanting
in
monotonous
thunder
tones
the
song
of
the
deep
the
banks
were
covered
with
trees
and
vegetation
i
can
not
express
my
feeling
of
exultation
at
this
discovery
my
father
stood
motionless
with
his
hand
on
the
tiller
looking
straight
ahead
pouring
out
his
heart
in
thankful
prayer
and
thanksgiving
to
the
gods
odin
and
thor
in
the
meantime
a
net
which
we
found
in
the
stowage
had
been
cast
and
we
caught
a
few
fish
that
materially
added
to
our
dwindling
stock
of
provisions
the
compass
which
we
had
fastened
back
in
its
place
in
fear
of
another
storm
was
still
pointing
due
north
and
moving
on
its
pivot
just
as
it
had
at
stockholm
the
dipping
of
the
needle
had
ceased
what
could
this
mean
then
too
our
many
days
of
sailing
had
certainly
carried
us
far
past
the
north
pole
and
yet
the
needle
continued
to
point
north
we
were
sorely
perplexed
for
surely
our
direction
was
now
south
peary

pages
and
says
on

the
nearest
to

the
latitude
of
the
place
of
observation
was
degrees
and

the
magnetic

degrees
west
in

longitude
of
degrees
where
the
last
observations
on
the
shore
had
been
made
to
degrees
east
at
their
present
station
so
that
we
had
says
peary
in
sailing
over
the
space
included
between
these
two
meridians
crossed
immediately
northward
of
the
magnetic
pole
and
had
undoubtedly
passed
over
one
of
those
spots
upon
the
globe
where
the
needle
would
have
been
found
to
vary
degrees
or
in
other
words
where
the
north
pole
would
have
pointed
to
the
south
we
sailed
for
three
days
along
the
shoreline
then
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
fjord
or
river
of
immense
size
it
seemed
more
like
a
great
bay
and
into
this
we
turned
our
the
direction
being
slightly
northeast
of
south
by
the
assistance
of
a
fretful
wind
that
came
to
our
aid
about
twelve
hours
out
of
every
we
continued
to
make
our
way
inland
into
what
afterward
proved
to
be
a
mighty
river
and
which
we
learned
was
called
by
the
inhabitants
hiddekel
we
continued
our
journey
for
ten
days
thereafter
and
found
we
had
fortunately
attained
a
distance
inland
where
ocean
tides
no
longer
affected
the
water
which
had
become
fresh
the
discovery
came
none
too
soon
for
our
remaining
cask
of
water
was
exhausted
we
lost
no
time
in
replenishing
our
casks
and
continued
to
sail
farther
up
the
river
when
the
wind
was
favorable
along
the
banks
great
forests
miles
in
extent
could
be
seen
stretching
away
on
the
the
trees
were
of
enormous
size
we
landed
after
anchoring
near
a
sandy
beach
and
waded
ashore
and
were
rewarded
by
finding
a
quantity
of
nuts
that
were
very
palatable
and
satisfying
to
hunger
and
a
welcome
change
from
the
monotony
of
our
stock
of
provisions
it
was
about
the
first
of
september
over
five
months
we
calculated
since
our
from
stockholm
suddenly
we
were
frightened
almost
out
of
our
wits
by
hearing
in
the
far
distance
the
singing
of
people
very
soon
thereafter
we
discovered
a
huge
ship
gliding
down
the
river
directly
toward
us
those
aboard
were
singing
in
one
mighty
chorus
that
echoing
from
bank
to
bank
sounded
like
a
thousand
voices
filling
the
whole
universe
with
quivering
melody
the
accompaniment
was
played
on
stringed
instruments
not
unlike
our
harps
it
was
a
larger
ship
than
any
we
had
ever
seen
and
was
differently
constructed
asiatic

page
paradise
found
from
translation
by
sayce
in
a
book
called
records
of
the
past
we
were
told
of
a
dwelling
which
the
gods
created
for
the
first
human
beings
a
dwelling
in
which
they
became
great
and
increased
in
numbers
and
the
location
of
which
is
described
in
words
exactly
corresponding
to
those
of
iranian
indian
chinese
eddaic
and
aztecan
literature
namely
in
the
center
of
the
warren
at
this
particular
time
our
sloop
was
becalmed
and
not
far
from
the
shore
the
bank
of
the
river
covered
with
mammoth
trees
rose
up
several
hundred
feet
in
beautiful
fashion
we
seemed
to
be
on
the
edge
of
some
primeval
forest
that
doubtless
stretched
far
inland
the
immense
craft
paused
and
almost
immediately
a
boat
was
lowered
and
six
men
of
gigantic
stature
rowed
to
our
little
they
spoke
to
us
in
a
strange
language
we
knew
from
their
manner
however
that
they
were
not
unfriendly
they
talked
a
great
deal
among
themselves
and
one
of
them
laughed
immoderately
as
though
in
finding
us
a
queer
discovery
had
been
made
one
of
them
spied
our
compass
and
it
seemed
to
interest
them
more
than
any
other
part
of
our
sloop
finally
the
leader
motioned
as
if
to
ask
whether
we
were
willing
to
leave
our
craft
to
go
on
board
their
ship
what
say

my
son
asked
my
father
they
can
not
do
any
more
than
kill

be

said
my
father
smiling
for
they
are
certainly
able
to
capture
us
thereupon
he
made
known
by
signs
that
we
were
ready
to
accompany
them
within
a
few
minutes
we
were
on
board
the
ship
and
half
an
hour
later
our
little
had
been
lifted
bodily
out
of
the
water
by
a
strange
sort
of
hook
and
tackle
and
set
on
board
as
a
curiosity
there
were
several
hundred
people
on
board
this
to
us
mammoth
ship
which
we
discovered
was
called

we
afterward
learned

to
give
a
more
proper
interpretation
pleasure

if
my
father
and
i
were
curiously
observed
by
the
ship
occupants
this
strange
race
of
giants
offered
us
an
equal
amount
of
wonderment
there
was
not
a
single
man
aboard
who
would
not
have
measured
fully
twelve
feet
in
height
they
all
wore
full
beards
not
particularly
long
but
seemingly
they
had
mild
and
beautiful
faces
exceedingly
fair
with
ruddy
complexions
the
hair
and
beard
of
some
were
black
others
sandy
and
still
others
yellow
the

as
we
designated
the
dignitary
in
command
of
the
great
vessel
was
fully
a
head
taller
than
any
of
his
companions
the
women
averaged
from
ten
to
eleven
feet
in
height
their
features
were
especially
regular
and
refined
while
their
complexion
was
of
a
most
delicate
tint

by
a
healthful
glow
according
to
all
procurable
data

spot
at
the

in

lost

surrounded

one
seemed

all
laughed
heartily
i
remember
when
they
had
to
improvise
chairs
for
my
father
and
myself
to
sit
at
table
they
were
richly
attired
in
a
costume
peculiar
to
themselves
and
very
attractive
the
men
were
clothed
in
handsomely
embroidered
tunics
of
silk
and
satin
and
belted
at
the
waist
they
wore
and
stockings
of
a
fine
texture
while
their
feet
were
encased
in
sandals
adorned
with
gold
buckles
we
early
discovered
that
gold
was
one
of
the
most
common
metals
known
and
that
it
was
used
extensively
in
decoration
strange
as
it
may
seem
neither
my
father
nor
myself
felt
the
least
bit
of
solicitude
for
our
safety
we
have
come
into
our
own

father
said
to
me
this
is
the
fulfillment
of
the
tradition
told
me
by
my
father
and
my
father
father
and
still
back
for
many
generations
of
our
race
this
is
assuredly
the
land
beyond
the
north
wind
we
seemed
to
make
such
an
impression
on
the
party
that
we
were
given
specially
into
the
charge
of
one
of
the
men
jules
galdea
and
his
wife
for
the
purpose
of
being
educated
in
their
language
and
we
on
our
part
were
just
as
eager
to
learn
as
they
were
to
instruct
at
the
captain
command
the
vessel
was
swung
cleverly
about
and
began
retracing
its
course
up
the
river
the
machinery
while
noiseless
was
very
powerful
the
banks
and
trees
on
either
side
seemed
to
rush
by
the
ship
speed
at
times
surpassed
that
of
any
railroad
train
on
which
i
have
ever
ridden
even
here
in
america
it
was
wonderful
in
the
meantime
we
had
lost
sight
of
the
sun
rays
but
we
found
a
radiance
within
emanating
from
the
sun
which
had
already
attracted
our
attention
now
giving
out
a
white
light
seemingly
from
a
far
away
in
front
of
us
it
dispensed
a
greater
light
i
should
say
than
two
full
moons
on
the
clearest
night
in
twelve
hours
this
cloud
of
whiteness
would
pass
out
of
sight
as
if
eclipsed
and
the
twelve
hours
following
corresponded
with
our
night
we
early
learned
that
these
strange
people
were
worshipers
of
this
great
cloud
of
night
it
was
the
smoky
god
of
the
inner
world
the
ship
was
equipped
with
a
mode
of
illumination
which
i
now
presume
was
electricity
but
neither
my
father
nor
myself
were
sufficiently
skilled
in
mechanics
to
understand
whence
came
the
power
to
operate
the
ship
or
to
maintain
the
soft
beautiful
lights
that
answered
the
same
purpose
of
our
present
methods
of
lighting
the
streets
of
our
cities
our
houses
and
places
of
business
it
must
be
remembered
the
time
of
which
i
write
was
the
autumn
of
and
we
of
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
knew
nothing
then
so
to
speak
of
electricity
the
electrically
surcharged
condition
of
the
air
was
a
constant
vitalizer
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
than
during
the
two
years
my
father
and
i
sojourned
on
the
inside
of
the
earth
to
resume
my
narrative
of
events
the
ship
on
which
we
were
sailing
came
to
a
stop
two
days
after
we
had
been
taken
on
board
my
father
said
as
nearly
as
he
could
judge
we
were
directly
under
stockholm
or
london
the
city
we
had
reached
was
called
jehu
signifying
a
seaport
town
the
houses
were
large
and
beautifully
constructed
and
quite
uniform
in
appearance
yet
without
sameness
the
principal
occupation
of
the
people
appeared
to
be
agriculture
the
hillsides
were
covered
with
vineyards
while
the
valleys
were
devoted
to
the
growing
of
grain
i
never
saw
such
a
display
of
gold
it
was
everywhere
the
were
inlaid
and
the
tables
were
veneered
with
sheetings
of
gold
domes
of
the
public
buildings
were
of
gold
it
was
used
most
generously
in
the
finishings
of
the
great
temples
of
music
vegetation
grew
in
lavish
exuberance
and
fruit
of
all
kinds
possessed
the
most
delicate
flavor
clusters
of
grapes
four
and
five
feet
in
length
each
grape
as
large
as
an
orange
and
apples
larger
than
a
head
typified
the
wonderful
growth
of
all
things
on
the
inside
of
the
earth
the
great
redwood
trees
of
california
would
be
considered
mere
underbrush
compared
with
the
giant
forest
trees
extending
for
miles
and
miles
in
all
directions
in
many
directions
along
the
foothills
of
the
mountains
vast
herds
of
cattle
were
seen
during
the
last
day
of
our
travel
on
the
river
we
heard
much
of
a
city
called
eden
but
were
kept
at
jehu
for
an
entire
year
by
the
end
of
that
time
we
had
learned
to
speak
fairly
well
the
language
of
this
strange
race
of
people
our
instructors
jules
galdea
and
his
wife
exhibited
a
patience
that
was
truly
commendable
one
day
an
envoy
from
the
ruler
at
eden
came
to
see
us
and
for
two
whole
days
my
father
and
myself
were
put
through
a
series
of
surprising
questions
they
wished
to
know
from
whence
we
came
what
sort
of
people
dwelt
without
what
god
we
worshiped
our
religious
beliefs
the
mode
of
living
in
our
strange
land
and
a
thousand
other
things
the
compass
which
we
had
brought
with
us
attracted
especial
attention
my
father
and
i
commented
between
ourselves
on
the
fact
that
the
compass
still
pointed
north
although
we
now
knew
that
we
had
sailed
over
the
curve
or
edge
of
the
earth
aperture
and
were
far
along
southward
on
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth
crust
which
according
to
my
father
estimate
and
my
own
is
about
three
hundred
miles
in
thickness
from
the
inside
to
the
outside
surface
relatively
speaking
it
is
no
thicker
than
an
so
that
there
is
almost
as
much
surface
on
the
inside
as
on
the
outside
of
the
earth
the
great
luminous
cloud
or
ball
of
fire
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
and
during
the
day
giving
off
a
beautiful
white
light
the
smoky
god
is
seemingly
suspended
in
the
center
of
the
great
vacuum
within
the
earth
and
held
to
its
place
by
the
immutable
law
of
gravitation
or
a
repellant
atmospheric
force
as
the
case
may
be
i
refer
to
the
known
power
that
draws
or
repels
with
equal
force
in
all
directions
the
base
of
this
electrical
cloud
or
central
luminary
the
seat
of
the
gods
is
dark
and
save
for
innumerable
small
openings
seemingly
in
the
bottom
of
the
great
support
or
altar
of
the
deity
upon
which
the
smoky
god
rests
and
the
lights
shining
through
these
many
openings
twinkle
at
night
in
all
their
splendor
and
seem
to
be
stars
as
natural
as
the
stars
we
saw
shining
when
in
our
home
at
stockholm
excepting
that
they
appear
larger
the
smoky
god
therefore
with
each
daily
revolution
of
the
earth
appears
to
come
up
in
the
east
and
go
down
in
the
west
the
same
as
does
our
sun
on
the
external
surface
in
reality
the
people
within
believe
that
the
smoky
god
is
the
throne
of
their
jehovah
and
is
stationary
the
effect
of
night
and
day
is
therefore
produced
by
the
earth
daily
rotation
i
have
since
discovered
that
the
language
of
the
people
of
the
inner
world
is
much
like
the
sanskrit
after
we
had
given
an
account
of
ourselves
to
the
emissaries
from
the
central
seat
of
government
of
the
inner
continent
and
my
father
had
in
his
crude
way
drawn
maps
at
their
request
of
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
showing
the
divisions
of
land
and
water
and
giving
the
name
of
each
of
the
continents
large
islands
and
the
oceans
we
were
taken
overland
to
the
city
of
eden
in
a
conveyance
different
from
anything
we
have
in
europe
or
america
this
vehicle
was
doubtless
some
electrical
contrivance
it
was
noiseless
and
ran
on
a
single
iron
rail
in
perfect
balance
the
trip
was
made
at
a
very
high
rate
of
speed
we
were
carried
up
hills
and
down
dales
across
valleys
and
again
along
the
sides
of
steep
mountains
without
any
apparent
attempt
having
been
made
to
level
the
earth
as
we
do
for
railroad
tracks
the
car
seats
were
huge
yet
comfortable
affairs
and
very
high
above
the
floor
of
the
car
on
the
top
of
each
car
were
high
geared
fly
wheels
lying
on
their
sides
which
were
so
automatically
adjusted
that
as
the
speed
of
the
car
increased
the
high
speed
of
these
fly
wheels
geometrically
increased
jules
galdea
explained
to
us
that
these
revolving
wheels
on
top
of
the
cars
destroyed
atmospheric
pressure
or
what
is
generally
understood
by
the
term
gravitation
and
with
this
force
thus
destroyed
or
rendered
nugatory
the
car
is
as
safe
from
falling
to
one
side
or
the
other
from
the
single
rail
track
as
if
it
were
in
a
vacuum
the
fly
wheels
in
their
rapid
revolutions
destroying
effectually
the
power
of
gravitation
or
the
force
of
atmospheric
pressure
or
whatever
potent
influence
it
may
be
that
causes
all
unsupported
things
to
fall
downward
to
the
earth
surface
or
to
the
nearest
point
of
resistance
the
surprise
of
my
father
and
myself
was
indescribable
when
amid
the
regal
magnificence
of
a
spacious
hall
we
were
finally
brought
before
the
great
high
priest
ruler
over
all
the
land
he
was
richly
robed
and
much
taller
than
those
about
him
and
could
not
have
been
less
than
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
in
height
the
immense
room
in
which
we
were
received
seemed
finished
in
solid
slabs
of
gold
thickly
studded
with
jewels
of
amazing
brilliancy
the
city
of
eden
is
located
in
what
seems
to
be
a
beautiful
valley
yet
in
fact
it
is
on
the
loftiest
mountain
plateau
of
the
inner
continent
several
thousand
feet
higher
than
any
portion
of
the
surrounding
country
it
is
the
most
beautiful
place
i
have
ever
beheld
in
all
my
travels
in
this
elevated
garden
all
manner
of
fruits
vines
shrubs
trees
and
flowers
grow
in
riotous
profusion
in
this
garden
four
rivers
have
their
source
in
a
mighty
artesian
fountain
they
divide
and
flow
in
four
directions
this
place
is
called
by
the
inhabitants
the
navel
of
the
earth
or
the
beginning
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
the
names
of
the
rivers
are
the
euphrates
the
pison
the
gihon
and
the
hiddekel
and
the
lord
god
planted
a
garden
and
out
of
the
ground
made
the
lord
god
to
grow
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
good
for
food
the
book
of
genesis
the
unexpected
awaited
us
in
this
palace
of
beauty
in
the
finding
of
our
little
it
had
been
brought
before
the
high
priest
in
perfect
shape
just
as
it
had
been
taken
from
the
waters
that
day
when
it
was
loaded
on
board
the
ship
by
the
people
who
discovered
us
on
the
river
more
than
a
year
before
we
were
given
an
audience
of
over
two
hours
with
this
great
dignitary
who
seemed
kindly
disposed
and
considerate
he
showed
himself
eagerly
interested
asking
us
numerous
questions
and
invariably
regarding
things
about
which
his
emissaries
had
failed
to
inquire
at
the
conclusion
of
the
interview
he
inquired
our
pleasure
asking
us
whether
we
wished
to
remain
in
his
country
or
if
we
preferred
to
return
to
the
outer
world
providing
it
were
possible
to
make
a
successful
return
trip
across
the
frozen
belt
barriers
that
encircle
both
the
northern
and
southern
openings
of
the
earth
my
father
replied
it
would
please
me
and
my
son
to
visit
your
country
and
see
your
people
your
colleges
and
palaces
of
music
and
art
your
great
fields
your
wonderful
forests
of
timber
and
after
we
have
had
this
pleasurable
privilege
we
should
like
to
try
to
return
to
our
home
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
this
son
is
my
only
child
and
my
good
wife
will
be
weary
awaiting
our
return
i
fear
you
can
never
return
replied
the
chief
high
priest
because
the
way
is
a
most
hazardous
one
however
you
shall
visit
the
different
countries
with
jules
galdea
as
your
escort
and
be
accorded
every
courtesy
and
kindness
whenever
you
are
ready
to
attempt
a
return
voyage
i
assure
you
that
your
boat
which
is
here
on
exhibition
shall
be
put
in
the
waters
of
the
river
hiddekel
at
its
mouth
and
we
will
bid
you
thus
terminated
our
only
interview
with
the
high
priest
or
ruler
of
the
continent
part
four
in
the
under
world
we
learned
that
the
males
do
not
marry
before
they
are
from
to
one
hundred
years
old
and
that
the
age
at
which
women
enter
wedlock
is
only
a
little
less
and
that
both
men
and
women
frequently
live
to
be
from
six
to
eight
hundred
years
old
and
in
some
instances
much
older
josephus
says
god
prolonged
the
life
of
the
patriarchs
that
preceded
the
deluge
both
on
account
of
their
virtues
and
to
give
them
the
opportunity
of
perfecting
the
sciences
of
geometry
and
astronomy
which
they
had
discovered
which
they
could
not
have
done
if
they
had
not
lived
years
because
it
is
only
after
the
lapse
of
years
that
the
great
year
is
accomplished
flammarion
astronomical
myths
paris
p
during
the
following
year
we
visited
many
villages
and
towns
prominent
among
them
being
the
cities
of
nigi
delfi
hectea
and
my
father
was
called
upon
no
less
than
a
times
to
go
over
the
maps
which
had
been
made
from
the
rough
sketches
he
had
originally
given
of
the
divisions
of
land
and
water
on
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
i
remember
hearing
my
father
remark
that
the
giant
race
of
people
in
the
land
of
the
smoky
god
had
almost
as
accurate
an
idea
of
the
geography
of
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
as
had
the
average
college
professor
in
stockholm
in
our
travels
we
came
to
a
forest
of
gigantic
trees
near
the
city
of
delfi
had
the
bible
said
there
were
trees
towering
over
three
hundred
feet
in
height
and
more
than
thirty
feet
in
diameter
growing
in
the
garden
of
eden
the
ingersolls
the
tom
paines
and
voltaires
would
doubtless
have
pronounced
the
statement
a
myth
yet
this
is
the
description
of
the
california
sequoia
gigantea
but
these
california
giants
pale
into
insignificance
when
compared
with
the
forest
goliaths
found
in
the
within
continent
where
abound
mighty
trees
from
eight
hundred
to
one
thousand
feet
in
height
and
from
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
in
diameter
countless
in
numbers
and
forming
forests
extending
hundreds
of
miles
back
from
the
sea
the
people
are
exceedingly
musical
and
learned
to
a
remarkable
degree
in
their
arts
and
sciences
especially
geometry
and
astronomy
their
cities
are
equipped
with
vast
palaces
of
music
where
not
infrequently
as
many
as
thousand
lusty
voices
of
this
giant
race
swell
forth
in
mighty
choruses
of
the
most
sublime
symphonies
the
children
are
not
supposed
to
attend
institutions
of
learning
before
they
are
twenty
years
old
then
their
school
life
begins
and
continues
for
thirty
years
ten
of
which
are
uniformly
devoted
by
both
sexes
to
the
study
of
music
their
principal
vocations
are
architecture
agriculture
horticulture
the
raising
of
vast
herds
of
cattle
and
the
building
of
conveyances
peculiar
to
that
country
for
travel
on
land
and
water
by
some
device
which
i
can
not
explain
they
hold
communion
with
one
another
between
the
most
distant
parts
of
their
country
on
air
currents
all
buildings
are
erected
with
special
regard
to
strength
durability
beauty
and
symmetry
and
with
a
style
of
architecture
vastly
more
attractive
to
the
eye
than
any
i
have
ever
observed
elsewhere
about
of
the
inner
surface
of
the
earth
is
land
and
about
water
there
are
numerous
rivers
of
tremendous
size
some
flowing
in
a
northerly
direction
and
others
southerly
some
of
these
rivers
are
thirty
miles
in
width
and
it
is
out
of
these
vast
waterways
at
the
extreme
northern
and
southern
parts
of
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth
in
regions
where
low
temperatures
are
experienced
that
icebergs
are
formed
they
are
then
pushed
out
to
sea
like
huge
tongues
of
ice
by
the
abnormal
freshets
of
turbulent
waters
that
twice
every
year
sweep
everything
before
them
we
saw
innumerable
specimens
of
no
larger
than
those
encountered
in
the
forests
of
europe
or
america
it
is
well
known
that
during
the
last
few
years
whole
species
of
birds
have
quit
the
earth
a
writer
in
a
recent
article
on
this
subject
says
almost
every
year
sees
the
final
extinction
of
one
or
more
bird
species
out
of
fourteen
varieties
of
birds
found
a
century
since
on
a
single
island
the
west
indian
island
of
thomas
eight
have
now
to
be
numbered
among
the
missing
is
it
not
possible
that
these
disappearing
bird
species
quit
their
habitation
without
and
find
an
asylum
in
the
within
world
whether
inland
among
the
mountains
or
along
the
seashore
we
found
bird
life
prolific
when
they
spread
their
great
wings
some
of
the
birds
appeared
to
measure
thirty
feet
from
tip
to
tip
they
are
of
great
variety
and
many
colors
we
were
permitted
to
climb
up
on
the
edge
of
a
rock
and
examine
a
nest
of
eggs
there
were
five
in
the
nest
each
of
which
was
at
least
two
feet
in
length
and
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
after
we
had
been
in
the
city
of
hectea
about
a
week
professor
galdea
took
us
to
an
inlet
where
we
saw
thousands
of
tortoises
along
the
sandy
shore
i
hesitate
to
state
the
size
of
these
great
creatures
they
were
from
to
thirty
feet
in
length
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
in
width
and
fully
seven
feet
in
height
when
one
of
them
projected
its
head
it
had
the
appearance
of
some
hideous
sea
monster
the
strange
conditions
within
are
favorable
not
only
for
vast
meadows
of
luxuriant
grasses
forests
of
giant
trees
and
all
manner
of
vegetable
life
but
wonderful
animal
life
as
well
one
day
we
saw
a
great
herd
of
elephants
there
must
have
been
five
hundred
of
these
monsters
with
their
restlessly
waving
trunks
they
were
tearing
huge
boughs
from
the
trees
and
trampling
smaller
growth
into
dust
like
so
much
they
would
average
over
feet
in
length
and
from
to
in
height
it
seemed
as
i
gazed
upon
this
wonderful
herd
of
giant
elephants
that
i
was
again
living
in
the
public
library
at
stockholm
where
i
had
spent
much
time
studying
the
wonders
of
the
miocene
age
i
was
filled
with
mute
astonishment
and
my
father
was
speechless
with
awe
he
held
my
arm
with
a
protecting
grip
as
if
fearful
harm
would
overtake
us
we
were
two
atoms
in
this
great
forest
and
fortunately
unobserved
by
this
vast
herd
of
elephants
as
they
drifted
on
and
away
following
a
leader
as
does
a
herd
of
sheep
they
browsed
from
growing
herbage
which
they
encountered
as
they
traveled
and
now
and
again
shook
the
firmament
with
their
deep
bellowing
moreover
there
were
a
great
number
of
elephants
in
the
island
and
there
was
provision
for
animals
of
every
kind
also
whatever
fragrant
things
there
are
in
the
earth
whether
roots
or
herbage
or
woods
or
distilling
drops
of
flowers
or
fruits
grew
and
thrived
in
that
land
the
cratylus
of
plato
there
is
a
hazy
mist
that
goes
up
from
the
land
each
evening
and
it
invariably
rains
once
every
hours
this
great
moisture
and
the
invigorating
electrical
light
and
warmth
account
perhaps
for
the
luxuriant
vegetation
while
the
highly
charged
electrical
air
and
the
evenness
of
climatic
conditions
may
have
much
to
do
with
the
giant
growth
and
longevity
of
all
animal
life
in
places
the
level
valleys
stretched
away
for
many
miles
in
every
direction
the
smoky
god
in
its
clear
white
light
looked
calmly
down
there
was
an
intoxication
in
the
electrically
surcharged
air
that
fanned
the
cheek
as
softly
as
a
vanishing
whisper
nature
chanted
a
lullaby
in
the
faint
murmur
of
winds
whose
breath
was
sweet
with
the
fragrance
of
bud
and
blossom
after
having
spent
considerably
more
than
a
year
in
visiting
several
of
the
many
cities
of
the
within
world
and
a
great
deal
of
intervening
country
and
more
than
two
years
had
passed
from
the
time
we
had
been
picked
up
by
the
great
excursion
ship
on
the
river
we
decided
to
cast
our
fortunes
once
more
upon
the
sea
and
endeavor
to
regain
the
outside
surface
of
the
earth
we
made
known
our
wishes
and
they
were
reluctantly
but
promptly
followed
our
hosts
gave
my
father
at
his
request
various
maps
showing
the
entire
inside
surface
of
the
earth
its
cities
oceans
seas
rivers
gulfs
and
bays
they
also
generously
offered
to
give
us
all
the
bags
of
gold
nuggets
some
of
them
as
large
as
a
goose
egg
that
we
were
willing
to
attempt
to
take
with
us
in
our
little
in
due
time
we
returned
to
jehu
at
which
place
we
spent
one
month
in
fixing
up
and
overhauling
our
little
fishing
sloop
after
all
was
in
readiness
the
same
ship
naz
that
originally
discovered
us
took
us
on
board
and
sailed
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
hiddekel
after
our
giant
brothers
had
launched
our
little
craft
for
us
they
were
most
cordially
regretful
at
parting
and
evinced
much
solicitude
for
our
safety
my
father
swore
by
the
gods
odin
and
thor
that
he
would
surely
return
again
within
a
year
or
two
and
pay
them
another
visit
and
thus
we
bade
them
adieu
we
made
ready
and
hoisted
our
sail
but
there
was
little
breeze
we
were
becalmed
within
an
hour
after
our
giant
friends
had
left
us
and
started
on
their
return
trip
the
winds
were
constantly
blowing
south
that
is
they
were
blowing
from
the
northern
opening
of
the
earth
toward
that
which
we
knew
to
be
south
but
which
according
to
our
compass
pointing
finger
was
directly
north
for
three
days
we
tried
to
sail
and
to
beat
against
the
wind
but
to
no
avail
whereupon
my
father
said
my
son
to
return
by
the
same
route
as
we
came
in
is
impossible
at
this
time
of
year
i
wonder
why
we
did
not
think
of
this
before
we
have
been
here
almost
two
and
a
half
years
therefore
this
is
the
season
when
the
sun
is
beginning
to
shine
in
at
the
southern
opening
of
the
earth
the
long
cold
night
is
on
in
the
spitzbergen
country
what
shall
we
do
i
inquired
there
is
only
one
thing
we
can
do
my
father
replied
and
that
is
to
go
south
accordingly
he
turned
the
craft
about
gave
it
full
reef
and
started
by
the
compass
north
but
in
fact
directly
south
the
wind
was
strong
and
we
seemed
to
have
struck
a
current
that
was
running
with
remarkable
swiftness
in
the
same
direction
in
just
forty
days
we
arrived
at
delfi
a
city
we
had
visited
in
company
with
our
guides
jules
galdea
and
his
wife
near
the
mouth
of
the
gihon
river
here
we
stopped
for
two
days
and
were
most
hospitably
entertained
by
the
same
people
who
had
welcomed
us
on
our
former
visit
we
laid
in
some
additional
provisions
and
again
set
sail
following
the
needle
due
north
on
our
outward
trip
we
came
through
a
narrow
channel
which
appeared
to
be
a
separating
body
of
water
between
two
considerable
bodies
of
land
there
was
a
beautiful
beach
to
our
right
and
we
decided
to
reconnoiter
casting
anchor
we
waded
ashore
to
rest
up
for
a
day
before
continuing
the
outward
hazardous
undertaking
we
built
a
fire
and
threw
on
some
sticks
of
dry
driftwood
while
my
father
was
walking
along
the
shore
i
prepared
a
tempting
repast
from
supplies
we
had
provided
there
was
a
mild
luminous
light
which
my
father
said
resulted
from
the
sun
shining
in
from
the
south
aperture
of
the
earth
that
night
we
slept
soundly
and
awakened
the
next
morning
as
refreshed
as
if
we
had
been
in
our
own
beds
at
stockholm
after
breakfast
we
started
out
on
an
inland
tour
of
discovery
but
had
not
gone
far
when
we
sighted
some
birds
which
we
recognized
at
once
as
belonging
to
the
penguin
family
they
are
flightless
birds
but
excellent
swimmers
and
tremendous
in
size
with
white
breast
short
wings
black
head
and
long
peaked
bills
they
stand
fully
nine
feet
high
they
looked
at
us
with
little
surprise
and
presently
waddled
rather
than
walked
toward
the
water
and
swam
away
in
a
northerly
direction
the
nights
are
never
so
dark
at
the
poles
as
in
other
regions
for
the
moon
and
stars
seem
to
possess
twice
as
much
light
and
effulgence
in
addition
there
is
a
continuous
light
the
varied
shades
and
play
of
which
are
amongst
the
strangest
phenomena
of
nature
astronomy
the
events
that
occurred
during
the
following
hundred
or
more
days
beggar
description
we
were
on
an
open
and
iceless
sea
the
month
we
reckoned
to
be
november
or
december
and
we
knew
the
south
pole
was
turned
toward
the
sun
therefore
when
passing
out
and
away
from
the
internal
electrical
light
of
the
smoky
god
and
its
genial
warmth
we
would
be
met
by
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
sun
shining
in
through
the
south
opening
of
the
earth
we
were
not
mistaken
the
fact
that
gives
the
phenomenon
of
the
polar
aurora
its
greatest
importance
is
that
the
earth
becomes
that
besides
the
light
which
as
a
planet
is
received
from
the
central
body
it
shows
a
capability
of
sustaining
a
luminous
process
proper
to
humboldt
there
were
times
when
our
little
craft
driven
by
wind
that
was
continuous
and
persistent
shot
through
the
waters
like
an
arrow
indeed
had
we
encountered
a
hidden
rock
or
obstacle
our
little
vessel
would
have
been
crushed
into
at
last
we
were
conscious
that
the
atmosphere
was
growing
decidedly
colder
and
a
few
days
later
icebergs
were
sighted
far
to
the
left
my
father
argued
and
correctly
that
the
winds
which
filled
our
sails
came
from
the
warm
climate
within
the
time
of
the
year
was
certainly
most
auspicious
for
us
to
make
our
dash
for
the
outside
world
and
attempt
to
scud
our
fishing
sloop
through
open
channels
of
the
frozen
zone
which
surrounds
the
polar
regions
we
were
soon
amid
the
and
how
our
little
craft
got
through
the
narrow
channels
and
escaped
being
crushed
i
know
not
the
compass
behaved
in
the
same
drunken
and
unreliable
fashion
in
passing
over
the
southern
curve
or
edge
of
the
earth
shell
as
it
had
done
on
our
inbound
trip
at
the
northern
entrance
it
gyrated
dipped
and
seemed
like
a
thing
possessed
captain
sabine
on
page
in
voyages
in
the
arctic
regions
says
the
geographical
determination
of
the
direction
and
intensity
of
the
magnetic
forces
at
different
points
of
the
earth
surface
has
been
regarded
as
an
object
worthy
of
especial
research
to
examine
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
the
declination
inclination
and
intensity
of
the
magnetic
force
and
their
periodical
and
secular
variations
and
mutual
relations
and
dependencies
could
be
duly
investigated
only
in
fixed
magnetical
observatories
one
day
as
i
was
lazily
looking
over
the
sloop
side
into
the
clear
waters
my
father
shouted
breakers
ahead
looking
up
i
saw
through
a
lifting
mist
a
white
object
that
towered
several
hundred
feet
high
completely
shutting
off
our
advance
we
lowered
sail
immediately
and
none
too
soon
in
a
moment
we
found
ourselves
wedged
between
two
monstrous
icebergs
each
was
crowding
and
grinding
against
its
fellow
mountain
of
ice
they
were
like
two
gods
of
war
contending
for
supremacy
we
were
greatly
alarmed
indeed
we
were
between
the
lines
of
a
battle
royal
the
sonorous
thunder
of
the
grinding
ice
was
like
the
continued
volleys
of
artillery
blocks
of
ice
larger
than
a
house
were
frequently
lifted
up
a
hundred
feet
by
the
mighty
force
of
lateral
pressure
they
would
shudder
and
rock
to
and
fro
for
a
few
seconds
then
come
crashing
down
with
a
deafening
roar
and
disappear
in
the
foaming
waters
thus
for
more
than
two
hours
the
contest
of
the
icy
giants
continued
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
had
come
the
ice
pressure
was
terrific
and
while
we
were
not
caught
in
the
dangerous
part
of
the
jam
and
were
safe
for
the
time
being
yet
the
heaving
and
rending
of
tons
of
ice
as
it
fell
splashing
here
and
there
into
the
watery
depths
filled
us
with
shaking
fear
finally
to
our
great
joy
the
grinding
of
the
ice
ceased
and
within
a
few
hours
the
great
mass
slowly
divided
and
as
if
an
act
of
providence
had
been
performed
right
before
us
lay
an
open
channel
should
we
venture
with
our
little
craft
into
this
opening
if
the
pressure
came
on
again
our
little
sloop
as
well
as
ourselves
would
be
crushed
into
nothingness
we
decided
to
take
the
chance
and
accordingly
hoisted
our
sail
to
a
favoring
breeze
and
soon
started
out
like
a
running
the
gauntlet
of
this
unknown
narrow
channel
of
open
water
part
five
among
the
ice
packs
for
the
next
days
our
time
was
employed
in
dodging
icebergs
and
hunting
channels
indeed
had
we
not
been
favored
with
a
strong
south
wind
and
a
small
boat
i
doubt
if
this
story
could
have
ever
been
given
to
the
world
at
last
there
came
a
morning
when
my
father
said
my
son
i
think
we
are
to
see
home
we
are
almost
through
the
ice
see
the
open
water
lies
before
us
however
there
were
a
few
icebergs
that
had
floated
far
northward
into
the
open
water
still
ahead
of
us
on
either
side
stretching
away
for
many
miles
directly
in
front
of
us
and
by
the
compass
which
had
now
righted
itself
due
north
there
was
an
open
sea
what
a
wonderful
story
we
have
to
tell
to
the
people
of
stockholm
continued
my
father
while
a
look
of
pardonable
elation
lighted
up
his
honest
face
and
think
of
the
gold
nuggets
stowed
away
in
the
hold
i
spoke
kind
words
of
praise
to
my
father
not
alone
for
his
fortitude
and
endurance
but
also
for
his
courageous
daring
as
a
discoverer
and
for
having
made
the
voyage
that
now
promised
a
successful
end
i
was
grateful
too
that
he
had
gathered
the
wealth
of
gold
we
were
carrying
home
while
congratulating
ourselves
on
the
goodly
supply
of
provisions
and
water
we
still
had
on
hand
and
on
the
dangers
we
had
escaped
we
were
startled
by
hearing
a
most
terrific
explosion
caused
by
the
tearing
apart
of
a
huge
mountain
of
ice
it
was
a
deafening
roar
like
the
firing
of
a
thousand
cannon
we
were
sailing
at
the
time
with
great
speed
and
happened
to
be
near
a
monstrous
iceberg
which
to
all
appearances
was
as
immovable
as
a
rockbound
island
it
seemed
however
that
the
iceberg
had
split
and
was
breaking
apart
whereupon
the
balance
of
the
monster
along
which
we
were
sailing
was
destroyed
and
it
began
dipping
from
us
my
father
quickly
anticipated
the
danger
before
i
realized
its
awful
possibilities
the
iceberg
extended
down
into
the
water
many
hundreds
of
feet
and
as
it
tipped
over
the
portion
coming
up
out
of
the
water
caught
our
like
a
lever
on
a
fulcrum
and
threw
it
into
the
air
as
if
it
had
been
a
our
boat
fell
back
on
the
iceberg
that
by
this
time
had
changed
the
side
next
to
us
for
the
top
my
father
was
still
in
the
boat
having
become
entangled
in
the
rigging
while
i
was
thrown
some
twenty
feet
away
i
quickly
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
shouted
to
my
father
who
answered
all
is
well
just
then
a
realization
dawned
upon
me
horror
upon
horror
the
blood
froze
in
my
veins
the
iceberg
was
still
in
motion
and
its
great
weight
and
force
in
toppling
over
would
cause
it
to
submerge
temporarily
i
fully
realized
what
a
sucking
maelstrom
it
would
produce
amid
the
worlds
of
water
on
every
side
they
would
rush
into
the
depression
in
all
their
fury
like
wolves
eager
for
human
prey
in
this
supreme
moment
of
mental
anguish
i
remember
glancing
at
our
boat
which
was
lying
on
its
side
and
wondering
if
it
could
possibly
right
itself
and
if
my
father
could
escape
was
this
the
end
of
our
struggles
and
adventures
was
this
death
all
these
questions
flashed
through
my
mind
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
a
moment
later
i
was
engaged
in
a
life
and
death
struggle
the
ponderous
monolith
of
ice
sank
below
the
surface
and
the
frigid
waters
gurgled
around
me
in
frenzied
anger
i
was
in
a
saucer
with
the
waters
pouring
in
on
every
side
a
moment
more
and
i
lost
consciousness
when
i
partially
recovered
my
senses
and
roused
from
the
swoon
of
a
man
i
found
myself
wet
stiff
and
almost
frozen
lying
on
the
iceberg
but
there
was
no
sign
of
my
father
or
of
our
little
fishing
sloop
the
monster
berg
had
recovered
itself
and
with
its
new
balance
lifted
its
head
perhaps
fifty
feet
above
the
waves
the
top
of
this
island
of
ice
was
a
plateau
perhaps
half
an
acre
in
extent
i
loved
my
father
well
and
was
at
the
awfulness
of
his
death
i
railed
at
fate
that
i
too
had
not
been
permitted
to
sleep
with
him
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
finally
i
climbed
to
my
feet
and
looked
about
me
the
sky
above
the
shoreless
green
ocean
beneath
and
only
an
occasional
iceberg
discernible
my
heart
sank
in
hopeless
despair
i
cautiously
picked
my
way
across
the
berg
toward
the
other
side
hoping
that
our
fishing
craft
had
righted
itself
dared
i
think
it
possible
that
my
father
still
lived
it
was
but
a
ray
of
hope
that
flamed
up
in
my
heart
but
the
anticipation
warmed
my
blood
in
my
veins
and
started
it
rushing
like
some
rare
stimulant
through
every
fiber
of
my
body
i
crept
close
to
the
precipitous
side
of
the
iceberg
and
peered
far
down
hoping
still
hoping
then
i
made
a
circle
of
the
berg
scanning
every
foot
of
the
way
and
thus
i
kept
going
around
and
around
one
part
of
my
brain
was
certainly
becoming
maniacal
while
the
other
part
i
believe
and
do
to
this
day
was
perfectly
rational
i
was
conscious
of
having
made
the
circuit
a
dozen
times
and
while
one
part
of
my
intelligence
knew
in
all
reason
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
hope
yet
some
strange
fascinating
aberration
bewitched
and
compelled
me
still
to
beguile
myself
with
expectation
the
other
part
of
my
brain
seemed
to
tell
me
that
while
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
father
being
alive
yet
if
i
quit
making
the
circuitous
pilgrimage
if
i
paused
for
a
single
moment
it
would
be
acknowledgment
of
defeat
and
should
i
do
this
i
felt
that
i
should
go
mad
thus
hour
after
hour
i
walked
around
and
around
afraid
to
stop
and
rest
yet
physically
powerless
to
continue
much
longer
oh
horror
of
horrors
to
be
cast
away
in
this
wide
expanse
of
waters
without
food
or
drink
and
only
a
treacherous
iceberg
for
an
abiding
place
my
heart
sank
within
me
and
all
semblance
of
hope
was
fading
into
black
despair
then
the
hand
of
the
deliverer
was
extended
and
the
stillness
of
a
solitude
rapidly
becoming
unbearable
was
suddenly
broken
by
the
firing
of
a
i
looked
up
in
startled
amazement
when
i
saw
less
than
a
away
a
bearing
down
toward
me
with
her
sail
full
set
evidently
my
continued
activity
on
the
iceberg
had
attracted
their
attention
on
drawing
near
they
put
out
a
boat
and
descending
cautiously
to
the
water
edge
i
was
rescued
and
a
little
later
lifted
on
board
the
i
found
it
was
a
scotch
whaler
the
arlington
she
had
cleared
from
dundee
in
september
and
started
immediately
for
the
antarctic
in
search
of
whales
the
captain
angus
macpherson
seemed
kindly
disposed
but
in
matters
of
discipline
as
i
soon
learned
possessed
of
an
iron
will
when
i
attempted
to
tell
him
that
i
had
come
from
the
inside
of
the
earth
the
captain
and
mate
looked
at
each
other
shook
their
heads
and
insisted
on
my
being
put
in
a
bunk
under
strict
surveillance
of
the
ship
physician
i
was
very
weak
for
want
of
food
and
had
not
slept
for
many
hours
however
after
a
few
days
rest
i
got
up
one
morning
and
dressed
myself
without
asking
permission
of
the
physician
or
anyone
else
and
told
them
that
i
was
as
sane
as
anyone
the
captain
sent
for
me
and
again
questioned
me
concerning
where
i
had
come
from
and
how
i
came
to
be
alone
on
an
iceberg
in
the
far
off
antarctic
ocean
i
replied
that
i
had
just
come
from
the
inside
of
the
earth
and
proceeded
to
tell
him
how
my
father
and
myself
had
gone
in
by
way
of
spitzbergen
and
come
out
by
way
of
the
south
pole
country
whereupon
i
was
put
in
irons
i
afterward
heard
the
captain
tell
the
mate
that
i
was
as
crazy
as
a
march
hare
and
that
i
must
remain
in
confinement
until
i
was
rational
enough
to
give
a
truthful
account
of
myself
finally
after
much
pleading
and
many
promises
i
was
released
from
irons
i
then
and
there
decided
to
invent
some
story
that
would
satisfy
the
captain
and
never
again
refer
to
my
trip
to
the
land
of
the
smoky
god
at
least
until
i
was
safe
among
friends
within
a
fortnight
i
was
permitted
to
go
about
and
take
my
place
as
one
of
the
seamen
a
little
later
the
captain
asked
me
for
an
explanation
i
told
him
that
my
experience
had
been
so
horrible
that
i
was
fearful
of
my
memory
and
begged
him
to
permit
me
to
leave
the
question
unanswered
until
some
time
in
the
future
i
think
you
are
recovering
considerably
he
said
but
you
are
not
sane
yet
by
a
good
deal
permit
me
to
do
such
work
as
you
may
assign
i
replied
and
if
it
does
not
compensate
you
sufficiently
i
will
pay
you
immediately
after
i
reach
stockholm
to
the
last
penny
thus
the
matter
rested
on
finally
reaching
stockholm
as
i
have
already
related
i
found
that
my
good
mother
had
gone
to
her
reward
more
than
a
year
before
i
have
also
told
how
later
the
treachery
of
a
relative
landed
me
in
a
madhouse
where
i
remained
for
years
seemingly
unending
years
and
still
later
after
my
release
how
i
returned
to
the
life
of
a
fisherman
following
it
sedulously
for
years
then
how
i
came
to
america
and
finally
to
los
angeles
california
but
all
this
can
be
of
little
interest
to
the
reader
indeed
it
seems
to
me
the
climax
of
my
wonderful
travels
and
strange
adventures
was
reached
when
the
scotch
took
me
from
an
iceberg
on
the
antarctic
ocean
part
six
conclusion
in
concluding
this
history
of
my
adventures
i
wish
to
state
that
i
firmly
believe
science
is
yet
in
its
infancy
concerning
the
cosmology
of
the
earth
there
is
so
much
that
is
unaccounted
for
by
the
accepted
knowledge
of
and
will
ever
remain
so
until
the
land
of
the
smoky
god
is
known
and
recognized
by
our
geographers
it
is
the
land
from
whence
came
the
great
logs
of
cedar
that
have
been
found
by
explorers
in
open
waters
far
over
the
northern
edge
of
the
earth
crust
and
also
the
bodies
of
mammoths
whose
bones
are
found
in
vast
beds
on
the
siberian
coast
northern
explorers
have
done
much

bernacchi
andree
amsden
amundson
and
others
have
all
been
striving
to
storm
the
frozen
citadel
of
mystery
i
firmly
believe
that
andree
and
his
two
brave
companions
strindberg
and
fraenckell
who
sailed
away
in
the
balloon
oreon
from
the
northwest
coast
of
spitzbergen
on
that
sunday
afternoon
of
july
are
now
in
the
within
world
and
doubtless
are
being
entertained
as
my
father
and
myself
were
entertained
by
the
giant
race
inhabiting
the
inner
atlantic
continent
having
in
my
humble
way
devoted
years
to
these
problems
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
accepted
definitions
of
gravity
as
well
as
the
cause
of
the
magnetic
needle
attraction
and
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
the
magnetic
needle
is
influenced
solely
by
electric
currents
which
completely
envelop
the
earth
like
a
garment
and
that
these
electric
currents
in
an
endless
circuit
pass
out
of
the
southern
end
of
the
earth
cylindrical
opening
diffusing
and
spreading
themselves
over
all
the
outside
surface
and
rushing
madly
on
in
their
course
toward
the
north
pole
and
while
these
currents
seemingly
dash
off
into
space
at
the
earth
curve
or
edge
yet
they
drop
again
to
the
inside
surface
and
continue
their
way
southward
along
the
inside
of
the
earth
crust
toward
the
opening
of
the
south
pole
lemstrom
concluded
that
an
electric
discharge
which
could
only
be
seen
by
means
of
the
spectroscope
was
taking
place
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
all
around
him
and
that
from
a
distance
it
would
appear
as
a
faint
display
of
aurora
the
phenomena
of
pale
and
flaming
light
which
is
some
times
seen
on
the
top
of
the
spitzbergen
mountains
the
arctic
manual
page
as
to
gravity
no
one
knows
what
it
is
because
it
has
not
been
determined
whether
it
is
atmospheric
pressure
that
causes
the
apple
to
fall
or
whether
miles
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
supposedly
way
through
the
earth
crust
there
exists
some
powerful
loadstone
attraction
that
draws
it
therefore
whether
the
apple
when
it
leaves
the
limb
of
the
tree
is
drawn
or
impelled
downward
to
the
nearest
point
of
resistance
is
unknown
to
the
students
of
physics
sir
james
ross
claimed
to
have
discovered
the
magnetic
pole
at
about
degrees
latitude
this
is
wrong
the
magnetic
pole
is
exactly
the
distance
through
the
earth
crust
thus
if
the
earth
crust
is
three
hundred
miles
in
thickness
which
is
the
distance
i
estimate
it
to
be
then
the
magnetic
pole
is
undoubtedly
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
matters
not
where
the
test
is
made
and
at
this
particular
point
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
the
surface
gravity
ceases
becomes
neutralized
and
when
we
pass
beyond
that
point
on
toward
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth
a
reverse
attraction
geometrically
increases
in
power
until
the
other
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
distance
is
traversed
which
would
bring
us
out
on
the
inside
of
the
earth
thus
if
a
hole
were
bored
down
through
the
earth
crust
at
london
paris
new
york
chicago
or
los
angeles
a
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
it
would
connect
the
two
surfaces
while
the
inertia
and
momentum
of
a
weight
dropped
in
from
the
outside
surface
would
carry
it
far
past
the
magnetic
center
yet
before
reaching
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth
it
would
gradually
diminish
in
speed
after
passing
the
halfway
point
finally
pause
and
immediately
fall
back
toward
the
outside
surface
and
continue
thus
to
oscillate
like
the
swinging
of
a
pendulum
with
the
power
removed
until
it
would
finally
rest
at
the
magnetic
center
or
at
that
particular
point
exactly
the
distance
between
the
outside
surface
and
the
inside
surface
of
the
earth

gyration
of
the
earth
in
its
daily
act
of
whirling
around
in
its
spiral
rotation
at
a
rate
greater
than
one
thousand
miles
every
hour
or
about
seventeen
miles
per
second
makes
of
it
a
vast

a
huge
machine

feeble

magnificent

far
away
in
almost
every

it
