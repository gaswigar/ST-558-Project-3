introduction
in
placing
before
my
readers
in
the
following
pages
the
results
of
my
years
experience
of
ferreting
i
may
say
that
i
have
always
done
my
best
to
accomplish
every
task
that
i
have
undertaken
and
i
have
in
consequence
received
excellent
testimonials
from
many
corporations
railway
companies
and
merchants
i
have
not
only
made
it
my
study
to
discover
the
different
and
the
best
methods
of
catching
rats
but
i
have
also
taken
great
interest
in
watching
their
ways
and
habits
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
sure
way
of
completely
exterminating
the
rodents
especially
in
large
towns
if
i
have
in
this
work
referred
more
particularly
to
in
manchester
that
is
only
because
my
experience
although
extending
over
a
much
wider
area
has
been
chiefly
in
that
city
but
the
methods
i
describe
are
equally
applicable
to
all
large
towns
yours

part
i
how
to
clear
rats
from
warehouses
offices
storerooms
etc
in
the
first
place
my
advice
is
never
poison
rats
in
any
enclosed
buildings
whatever
why
simply
because
the
rats
that
you
poison
are
drain
rats
or
what
you
call
black
rats
and
you
can
depend
upon
it
that
the
rats
that
you
poison
will
not
get
back
into
the
drains
but
die
under
the
floor
between
the
laths
and
plaster
and
the
consequence
is
that
in
a
few
days
the
stench
that
will
arise
will
be
most
obnoxious
and
there
is
nothing
more
injurious
than
the
smell
of
a
decomposed
rat
having
had
a
long
experience
in
manchester
i
am
quite
sure
of
this
as
an
instance
i
remember
a
private
house
where
i
was
engaged
catching
rats
under
a
floor
with
ferrets
i
went
as
far
as
possible
on
my
belly
under
the
floor
with
two
candles
in
my
hands
and
i
saw
the
ferret
kill
a
large
bitch
rat
about
six
yards
from
me
against
a
wall
where
neither
the
dog
nor
myself
could
get
at
it
i
finished
the
job
and
made
out
my
bill
for
my
services
but
in
about
two
or
three
weeks
after
they
again
sent
for
me
declaring
they
could
not
stay
in
the
on
account
of
the
smell
that
arose
from
beneath
the
flooring
boards
they
had
in
consequence
to
send
for
a
joiner
and
as
i
knew
the
exact
spot
where
the
rat
was
killed
i
ordered
him
to
take
up
the
floor
boards
just
where
the
dead
rat
lay
and
the
stench
that
arose
from
the
decomposed
rodent
was
bad
in
the
extreme
i
disinfected
the
place
and
i
was
never
sent
for
again
this
was
under
a
cold
floor
and
it
is
much
worse
where
there
is
any
heat
now
to
deal
with
the
different
methods
of
catching
rats
the
best
way
in
my
opinion
is
trapping
them
with
steel
spring
traps
whenever
you
are
trapping
never
on
any
consideration
put
bait
on
the
traps
always
put
traps
in
their
runs
but
you
will
find
rats
are
so
cunning
that
in
time
after
a
few
have
been
caught
they
will
jump
over
the
traps
and
then
you
must
try
another
way
a
good
one
is
the
following
viz
get
a
bag
of
fine
clean
sawdust
and
mix
with
it
about
its
weight
of
oatmeal
obtain
the
sawdust
fresh
from
under
the
saw
without
bits
of
stick
in
as
these
would
be
liable
to
get
into
the
teeth
of
the
trap
and
stop
them
from
closing
where
you
see
the
runs
put
a
handful
in
say
about
different
places
every
night
just
dropping
the
sawdust
and
meal
out
of
your
hands
in
little
heaps
that
means
different
heaps
do
this
for
four
nights
and
you
will
see
each
morning
that
the
sawdust
is
all
spread
about
now
for
four
more
nights
you
must
bury
a
set
trap
under
every
heap
of
sawdust
thus
you
will
have
traps
on
each
of
which
there
is
a
square
centre
plate
you
must
level
the
sawdust
over
the
plate
with
a
bit
of
stick
and
set
each
trap
as
fine
as
you
can
on
the
catch
spring
so
that
the
weight
of
a
mouse
would
set
it
off
they
will
play
in
the
sawdust
as
usual
and
you
will
have
rats
in
almost
every
trap
you
will
find
that
this
plan
will
capture
a
great
many
of
the
rodents
i
have
trapped
as
many
as
in
one
night
in
this
way
in
time
however
the
rats
will
cease
to
go
near
sawdust
then
you
must
procure
a
bag
of
fine
soot
from
any
chimney
sweep
and
you
will
find
that
they
will
go
at
the
soot
just
as
keen
as
they
did
in
the
first
instance
at
the
sawdust
when
they
get
tired
of
soot
which
they
will
in
time
you
must
procure
some
soft
tissue
paper
and
cut
it
fine
and
use
that
in
the
same
way
as
the
sawdust
and
the
soot
you
can
also
use
light
chaff
or
hay
seeds
with
the
like
result
i
must
not
omit
to
tell
my
readers
to
always
trap
rats
in
the
night
and
to
go
very
quietly
about
it
for
if
you
make
much
noise
they
will
give
over
feeding
you
must
not
go
about
with
too
big
a
light
whilst
trapping
you
should
stay
at
the
building
from
dark
until
midnight
and
every
time
a
rat
is
caught
in
the
trap
you
should
go
with
a
bull
eye
lamp
take
it
out
of
the
trap
or
kill
it
and
then
set
the
trap
again
as
you
have
the
chance
of
another
rat
in
the
same
trap
from
experience
i
can
say
that
you
need
not
stay
in
any
place
after
at
night
as
i
think
that
the
first
feed
is
the
best
and
that
the
first
three
hours
are
worth
all
the
other
part
of
the
night
you
can
go
home
at
and
be
sure
to
be
in
the
place
by
or
for
many
a
rat
caught
in
the
trap
by
the
front
leg
will
if
it
gets
time
eat
off
its
leg
and
get
away
again
and
they
are
very
cunning
to
catch
afterwards
never
have
your
traps
set
in
the
daytime
handle
them
as
little
as
possible
always
catch
as
many
rats
as
you
can
in
your
buildings
in
january
and
february
as
they
begin
to
breed
in
march
and
every
bitch
rat
means
on
the
average
eight
more
also
get
as
much
ferreting
done
as
possible
before
breeding
time
for
a
young
rat
can
get
into
the
ends
of
the
joisting
under
a
floor
where
a
ferret
can
not
get
near
it
and
the
consequence
is
that
a
ferret
is
unable
to
cope
with
its
task
the
best
thing
i
can
advise
for
clearing
young
rats
is
a
good
cat
one
that
must
not
be
handled
nor
made
a
pet
of
but
allowed
to
live
in
almost
a
wild
state
a
good
cat
can
do
as
much
in
my
opinion
in
one
night
when
rats
are
breeding
as
two
ferrets
can
do
in
a
day
especially
in
a
building
where
there
are
cavity
walls
as
it
is
impossible
for
a
ferret
to
follow
a
rat
in
such
walls
this
is
all
the
information
i
am
able
to
give
on
the
trapping
of
rats
a
method
i
have
proved
by
years
experience
to
excel
all
others
still
another
way
of
clearing
the
pests
is
as
follows
the
majority
of
rats
are
black
or
what
we
call
drain
rats
if
they
are
in
a
building
they
will
in
most
cases
come
from
a
sometimes
you
will
see
from
the
drain
pipes
in
the
say
a
pipe
fitted
into
a
pipe
and
the
joint
covered
round
with
clay
through
which
the
rats
eat
and
scratch
and
get
into
the
building
in
great
numbers
in
the
night
but
most
of
them
return
into
the
drains
during
the
day
now
if
it
is
the
breeding
season
about
eight
months
out
of
the
twelve
they
will
do
much
damage
to
silk
cotton
leather
lace
and
in
fact
all
other
light
goods
and
one
would
be
surprised
to
see
the
quantity
of
cloth
paper
they
will
procure
for
their
nests
whilst
breeding
the
way
to
get
clear
of
these
is
to
go
in
the
day
with
two
or
three
ferrets
and
leave
the
drain
pipe
open
ferret
them
all
back
into
the
drain
do
put
a
net
over
the
drain
for
fear
you
might
miss
one
or
two
if
they
got
back
into
the
building
they
would
be
hard
to
catch
as
they
would
not
face
the
net
again
then
after
ferreting
make
the
drain
good
and
if
there
be
an
odd
rat
or
two
left
in
the
building
you
will
get
them
in
a
few
nights
by
baiting
the
trap
there
is
another
way
of
catching
the
brown
rat
which
breeds
under
the
floor
in
large
buildings
where
there
are
no
drains
they
are
very
awkward
to
catch
always
have
a
trap
or
two
set
but
do
not
set
them
where
they
feed
place
them
in
their
runs
but
there
are
other
methods
for
other
places
for
instance
take
a
restaurant
where
they
feed
in
the
cooking
kitchen
we
will
suppose
they
have
eaten
four
holes
through
either
floor
or
skirting
boards
the
best
way
to
catch
these
however
many
holes
they
have
leading
into
the
kitchen
is
to
block
up
with
tin
or
similar
material
all
the
holes
with
the
exception
of
one
and
let
them
use
that
one
for
two
nights
then
put
a
plateful
of
good
food
such
as
oatmeal
and
oil
of
aniseed
as
far
from
the
hole
as
you
can
in
the
same
kitchen
then
run
a
small
train
of
meal
and
aniseed
from
the
hole
to
the
plate
next
drive
two
nails
in
the
wall
with
a
long
piece
of
string
tied
to
the
nail
heads
put
on
these
nails
a
brick
or
piece
of
board
right
above
the
hole
inches
up
the
wall
be
sure
the
nails
are
quite
loose
in
the
wall
over
the
hole
and
leave
in
that
position
for
two
nights
so
that
the
rats
will
get
used
to
it
on
the
night
that
you
are
going
to
catch
them
before
leaving
the
place
carry
the
string
from
the
nail
heads
to
the
door
or
window
let
the
door
or
window
be
closed
within
an
inch
with
the
end
of
the
string
outside
after
the
place
has
been
quiet
for
thirty
minutes
return
to
the
door
or
window
very
quietly
and
you
will
hear
the
rats
feeding
pull
the
string
the
loose
nails
come
out
of
the
wall
and
the
brick
or
board
drops
over
the
hole
you
can
then
go
in
close
the
door
turn
up
the
gas
and
catch
or
kill
them
at
your
leisure
as
they
can
not
get
back
again
by
this
method
i
may
mention
that
i
have
caught
a
great
number
of
rats
and
it
is
quite
possible
to
clear
a
place
in
this
manner
that
is
if
they
do
not
come
out
of
the
drains
i
have
caught
upwards
of
in
six
nights
in
this
way
the
best
time
to
catch
rats
in
any
building
is
always
at
night
and
always
about
after
the
place
has
been
closed
as
rats
are
generally
more
adventurous
to
come
for
their
first
feed
always
go
about
as
quietly
as
possible
in
some
of
the
very
old
manchester
buildings
that
were
built
in
the
days
before
drain
plans
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
corporation
one
finds
under
the
cellar
floors
brick
and
flag
drains
better
known
as
spit
drains
that
were
left
in
when
the
place
was
built
once
the
rats
get
in
these
disused
drains
all
the
professional
in
england
could
not
clear
them
without
pulling
the
building
down
the
rats
have
by
some
means
got
out
of
the
main
sewer
probably
by
the
bursting
of
a
sewer
into
one
of
these
disused
dry
brick
drains
it
is
then
impossible
to
get
underground
to
see
where
they
have
got
into
the
dry
drain
and
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
in
a
case
of
this
sort
is
to
engage
a
professional
occasionally
and
keep
two
or
three
good
cats
to
keep
the
rats
down
these
places
as
a
rule
are
more
plagued
with
them
when
it
is
very
wet
weather
and
there
are
floods
running
this
is
the
best
time
to
catch
them
as
they
are
all
under
the
floor
of
the
building
and
are
very
easy
to
catch
in
the
night
with
the
traps
as
a
rule
the
black
or
drain
rats
feed
only
in
the
night
very
rarely
in
the
day
as
they
are
of
a
dirty
nature
and
prefer
being
in
the
drains
in
my
opinion
the
black
rat
is
more
vicious
than
the
brown
there
is
another
rat
i
call
the
red
rat
which
is
akin
to
the
brown
rat
you
will
always
catch
these
at
a
tannery
or
about
kennels
where
hounds
are
kept
and
they
generally
feed
on
horseflesh
or
offal
red
rats
are
the
gameist
rats
i
know
for
whatever
kind
of
rats
are
put
into
the
store
cage
these
red
rats
kill
them
the
first
night
they
are
left
quiet
i
may
describe
another
mode
of
catching
rats
in
any
warehouse
storeroom
or
cellar
where
there
is
a
deal
of
rubbish
such
as
packing
cases
wrappers
waste
paper
throw
a
lot
of
food
say
oatmeal
or
soaked
bread
carelessly
amongst
the
cases
or
rubbish
and
let
the
rats
have
a
full
week
feeding
at
their
leisure
and
then
if
you
know
the
holes
round
the
floor
wherefrom
they
come
go
in
some
night
as
quick
as
possible
turn
up
the
lights
run
to
the
three
or
four
holes
and
block
them
up
with
pieces
of
rag
etc
now
as
all
the
rats
will
not
run
out
of
the
packing
cases
or
waste
paper
but
will
hide
amongst
the
same
this
is
the
time
to
take
a
good
terrier
dog
or
two
with
you
and
to
have
a
bit
of
sport
let
one
dog
hunt
among
the
cases
and
hold
the
other
for
the
rats
will
soon
make
for
the
holes
but
the
rags
preventing
their
escape
you
will
catch
and
kill
a
great
many
by
this
means
it
should
be
stated
here
that
as
rats
are
very
cunning
it
takes
a
lot
of
study
dodging
and
experience
to
be
able
to
rid
them
entirely
when
you
are
feeding
rats
anywhere
never
feed
them
with
other
than
soft
stuff
which
you
can
squeeze
through
your
fingers
for
if
you
feed
them
with
anything
lumpy
they
will
carry
pieces
into
their
holes
and
eat
at
their
leisure
ferreting
ferreting
is
a
very
good
plan
for
destroying
rats
in
cottage
houses
stables
hotels
as
it
can
be
done
in
the
day
but
in
buildings
say
five
or
six
storeys
high
you
can
not
ferret
very
well
as
you
can
not
tell
where
to
set
your
nets
the
only
way
to
ferret
a
large
building
is
to
ferret
one
floor
at
once
and
always
start
at
the
top
storey
first
the
majority
of
floors
are
laths
and
plaster
this
is
what
the
rat
likes
especially
the
brown
rat
and
there
are
more
nests
found
in
these
places
than
anywhere
else
to
ferret
thoroughly
in
such
places
you
will
require
to
have
a
board
up
at
each
end
of
the
floor
the
two
end
boards
that
run
crossways
with
the
joist
then
you
must
have
a
man
to
put
the
ferret
in
at
one
end
and
ferret
one
joist
at
a
time
have
a
net
set
at
the
other
end
the
best
way
at
the
catching
end
is
to
have
a
long
sheet
net
about
a
yard
wide
and
the
full
length
of
the
boards
that
are
up
for
sometimes
under
the
boards
the
rats
can
get
out
of
one
joist
into
another
and
if
you
use
the
long
net
you
can
catch
them
whichever
joist
they
bolt
at
now
we
will
suppose
you
are
ferreting
a
building
which
might
occupy
three
or
four
days
if
you
have
ferreted
two
stories
the
first
day
during
the
night
the
rats
that
have
not
been
ferreted
on
the
lower
stories
may
get
back
again
to
the
top
storey
how
to
prevent
this
happening
i
will
give
you
a
plan
of
my
own
which
i
do
think
any
but
myself
has
ever
employed
the
course
of
action
a
rather
expensive
one
i
admit
is
the
following
while
you
have
the
boards
up
you
must
go
to
the
druggist
and
get
two
shillings
worth
of
cayenne
pepper
and
put
it
into
a
pepper
duster
scatter
the
cayenne
along
the
boards
and
joist
where
you
have
had
the
long
sheet
net
and
also
along
the
other
end
of
the
joist
where
you
put
the
ferrets
in
and
you
will
find
that
under
no
consideration
will
rats
face
the
cayenne
pepper
cayenne
is
alright
for
any
dry
place
and
will
last
a
long
time
but
it
will
not
do
in
any
water
closets
or
any
damp
places
as
dampness
takes
all
the
nature
out
of
the
cayenne
after
ferreting
in
any
kind
of
building
always
go
carefully
round
the
outside
and
see
that
there
are
no
broken
air
grids
or
broken
cellar
windows
as
these
are
likely
ways
that
the
rats
get
into
the
building
at
first
when
ferreting
always
be
careful
how
you
set
your
nets
and
be
extremely
quick
on
the
rats
when
they
bolt
for
sometimes
if
they
get
back
they
will
face
the
ferret
before
they
will
bolt
again
then
the
ferrets
kill
them
under
the
floors
and
this
as
in
the
case
of
poisoning
them
is
liable
to
cause
an
abominable
smell
more
especially
where
heat
is
near
in
the
whole
of
my
experience
of
which
is
a
lengthy
one
i
never
gave
a
guarantee
to
clear
a
place
completely
in
manchester
or
any
other
town
where
so
many
large
buildings
are
so
close
together
and
let
me
show
the
reason
for
this
take
cannon
street
manchester
as
an
illustration
here
are
six
or
eight
different
firms
in
one
block
of
buildings
now
suppose
four
of
these
firms
are
suffering
from
the
damage
the
rats
are
doing
well
one
or
two
of
these
firms
may
go
to
the
expense
of
having
the
rats
cleared
away
but
between
the
two
buildings
there
may
be
a
hardware
business
or
ironmonger
shop
where
rats
can
not
do
any
harm
to
their
goods
the
owners
of
these
shops
will
not
go
to
the
expense
of
having
rats
caught
nor
will
they
let
us
go
into
their
shops
at
midnight
therefore
the
result
is
the
in
his
trapping
and
ferreting
is
limited
to
these
two
places
and
all
he
can
do
is
to
catch
some
and
drive
the
rest
into
the
hardware
shop
when
under
the
floors
in
such
places
one
finds
there
has
been
so
many
alterations
made
at
different
times
that
one
joist
may
be
a
foot
or
six
inches
below
the
other
and
when
the
rats
are
completely
driven
out
of
these
places
it
would
require
joiners
and
bricksetters
to
work
for
weeks
under
the
floors
to
stop
the
rats
returning
and
most
firms
will
not
go
to
this
expense
i
only
give
my
readers
this
as
an
illustration
of
what
has
often
happened
with
me
and
to
show
why
i
never
guarantee
to
clear
rats
completely
in
large
towns
if
they
are
in
a
private
house
stable
greenhouse
or
any
block
of
houses
of
say
five
or
six
i
might
then
after
looking
through
give
a
guarantee
to
clear
them
completely
these
are
the
fullest
details
i
can
give
you
and
if
you
will
put
any
of
the
ways
i
have
mentioned
into
practice
you
will
find
that
they
are
all
successful
especially
the
covering
of
traps
i
can
give
you
just
one
more
instance
in
manchester
where
i
was
engaged
the
workpeople
had
been
tormenting
the
rats
with
traps
not
knowing
how
to
set
them
they
sent
for
me
and
on
my
looking
round
the
place
i
knew
there
was
a
lot
of
rats
i
submitted
my
price
to
do
the
job
and
when
i
went
down
one
night
with
traps
dog
and
two
ferrets
i
thought
i
should
catch
or
rats
but
i
found
that
they
had
plagued
them
so
much
with
their
attempted
trapping
that
i
only
caught
three
in
the
whole
night
this
place
belonged
to
a
limited
company
and
when
i
went
before
the
committee
the
next
morning
they
were
not
satisfied
i
told
them
that
their
own
workpeople
had
tormented
the
rats
so
much
with
traps
that
the
rats
would
not
go
near
one
i
then
told
the
committee
that
i
would
still
stick
to
my
terms
but
i
would
leave
the
job
over
for
a
fortnight
now
during
that
fortnight
i
went
down
a
good
many
times
and
laid
the
sawdust
as
i
have
already
described
and
thus
got
the
rats
used
to
it
the
first
night
that
i
went
catching
i
took
with
me
traps
i
had
them
all
set
by
and
by
i
had
trapped
rats
the
next
night
rats
and
before
i
completed
the
job
with
the
trapping
and
the
other
ways
that
i
have
mentioned
i
caught
rats
this
i
give
merely
as
an
illustration
to
show
the
necessity
of
engaging
an
experienced
man
to
catch
rats
that
is
if
you
want
them
caught
and
to
confirm
the
statements
above
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
supply
privately
the
name
and
place
of
the
firm
and
also
to
give
a
personal
interview
if
necessary
and
now
a
word
or
two
respecting
the
different
ways
in
which
are
treated
many
people
think
that
a
is
favoured
if
they
give
him
permission
to
catch
rats
on
their
farms
or
round
the
banks
of
their
corn
or
wheat
fields
well
on
some
occasions
i
grant
this
may
be
a
favour
for
i
have
seen
when
i
have
had
an
order
in
hand
for
about
dozen
rats
and
have
had
only
a
day
or
two
in
which
to
get
them
such
are
the
only
times
and
circumstances
when
a
gives
his
services
gratis
and
simply
because
he
wants
the
live
rats
most
farmers
will
send
you
word
when
they
are
threshing
their
corn
and
then
the
value
of
the
rats
are
worth
the
day
work
to
the
this
is
all
right
as
far
as
it
goes
but
when
one
comes
to
consider
the
yearly
expenses
of
the
it
will
be
found
that
they
are
very
heavy
now
first
of
all
it
will
cost
at
the
least
pounds
annually
for
the
wear
and
tear
of
traps
alone
then
there
is
the
wear
and
tear
of
nets
two
dog
licences
always
three
or
four
ferrets
to
keep
and
ferrets
are
often
lost
down
drains
or
killed
by
rats
also
sundry
other
expenses
such
as
store
cages
etc
then
again
the
always
has
to
pay
a
man
to
help
him
i
do
call
a
trade
only
i
maintain
that
it
is
a
profession
and
one
that
requires
much
learning
and
courage
i
have
found
this
out
when
i
have
been
under
a
warehouse
floor
where
a
lot
of
rats
were
in
the
traps
and
i
could
not
get
one
man
out
of
to
come
under
the
floor
and
hold
the
candle
for
me
not
to
mention
helping
me
to
take
the
live
rats
out
of
the
traps
i
just
relate
this
because
at
some
places
where
we
go
and
where
we
catch
perhaps
rats
the
first
thing
they
say
when
the
bill
is
presented
is
why
you
have
got
worth
of
live
rats
they
do
think
of
the
damage
rats
can
do
to
fancy
goods
nor
do
they
consider
the
evil
smells
that
men
have
to
tolerate
under
the
floors
or
from
the
bad
drains
i
could
relate
many
interesting
anecdotes
of
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
about
rats
but
i
fear
its
perusal
might
take
up
too
much
of
my
time
there
is
however
one
thing
i
will
mention
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
of
rats
running
about
in
swarms
in
the
night
do
not
believe
it
in
my
whole
experience
i
have
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
a
swarm
of
these
when
i
have
had
an
empty
cage
on
my
back
and
an
order
for
dozen
live
rats
at
per
dozen
when
trapping
at
farms
on
a
moonlight
night
i
have
seen
a
train
of
rats
almost
in
single
file
going
from
a
barn
to
a
pit
or
brook
to
drink
and
then
i
have
simply
run
a
long
net
all
along
the
barn
very
quickly
sent
my
dog
round
the
pit
and
caught
all
the
rats
in
the
net
when
they
ran
back
to
get
in
the
barn
for
in
these
places
you
must
be
as
cunning
as
the
rats
to
catch
them
the
quickest
way
for
a
farmer
to
get
rid
of
rats
is
to
run
a
long
trail
of
good
oatmeal
outside
his
barn
doors
and
shoot
them
on
a
moonlight
night
i
have
seen
killed
at
a
shot
in
this
way
they
will
stay
eating
the
oatmeal
because
they
can
not
carry
it
away
at
farms
or
you
might
poison
rats
round
a
pit
or
along
brook
sides
where
they
go
to
drink
although
i
do
believe
in
poisoning
as
one
never
knows
where
it
ends
the
rats
being
likely
to
carry
the
poisoned
food
about
and
then
dogs
hens
pigs
pigeons
may
pick
it
up
there
may
be
a
few
more
ways
of
catching
rats
than
i
have
enumerated
but
i
think
i
have
given
the
best
ways
in
detail
some
people
think
that
to
use
the
mongoose
is
very
good
but
i
think
that
the
mongoose
is
no
better
than
a
good
fox
terrier
dog
or
a
good
cat
the
only
advantage
in
the
mongoose
being
that
all
the
rats
it
kills
it
will
bring
back
dead
to
its
habitation
and
that
stops
the
dead
rats
from
smelling
under
the
floors
i
think
that
the
mongoose
is
not
half
so
sly
or
sharp
as
a
good
cat
and
a
mongoose
moreover
has
to
be
taught
how
to
kill
a
rat
just
the
same
as
a
dog
i
am
fortunate
in
having
actually
seen
a
mongoose
and
a
rat
put
alive
in
a
tub
together
and
the
mongoose
would
not
even
look
at
the
rat
and
i
maintain
that
the
mongoose
can
not
compare
with
the
ferret
anytime
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
small
ferret
can
get
anywhere
that
a
rat
can
whilst
the
mongoose
must
wait
until
the
rat
comes
out
to
feed
for
instance
if
a
board
of
a
floor
be
left
up
for
a
mongoose
to
get
under
the
floor
it
can
only
get
into
one
of
the
joists
but
a
ferret
can
follow
a
rat
wherever
it
goes
then
again
the
rats
can
smell
a
mongoose
even
more
strongly
than
they
can
smell
a
cat
so
these
facts
prevent
my
recommending
a
mongoose
on
any
account
i
have
also
heard
of
people
experimenting
with
different
sorts
of
drugs
and
chemicals
for
enticing
rats
out
of
their
holes
i
hope
none
of
my
readers
will
be
attracted
with
this
device
i
hold
that
there
is
nothing
that
will
tempt
a
rat
from
its
hole
like
hunger
the
nearest
approach
that
i
have
found
to
entice
the
rodent
out
of
its
hole
is
oil
of
aniseed
or
oil
of
rhodium
but
the
latter
is
expensive
i
can
rely
best
on
oil
of
aniseed
because
i
have
often
successfully
tried
it
in
experiment
upon
the
plate
of
a
set
trap
i
have
placed
only
three
or
four
drops
of
oil
of
aniseed
upon
the
plate
of
a
set
trap
without
bait
and
often
the
trap
has
closed
and
trapped
the
rat
by
the
nose
so
that
it
will
be
seen
that
the
rat
must
have
been
licking
the
plate
or
it
could
not
be
caught
in
that
manner
i
have
also
frequently
noticed
when
i
have
set
say
traps
covered
with
meal
and
sawdust
mixed
that
if
i
have
put
only
two
drops
of
oil
of
aniseed
on
half
the
traps
i
should
find
next
morning
on
looking
at
the
traps
that
most
rats
are
in
those
in
which
i
had
placed
the
aniseed
i
think
that
oil
of
rhodium
and
oil
of
aniseed
are
very
good
to
drop
on
the
traps
after
setting
or
to
mix
with
the
stuff
with
which
the
traps
are
covered
there
is
also
another
way
of
bolting
rats
sometimes
when
the
ferret
is
put
under
a
boarded
floor
all
the
rats
will
run
together
and
pack
themselves
in
a
heap
at
the
end
of
a
joist
when
the
rats
pack
themselves
on
each
other
thus
the
ferret
on
reaching
them
will
tackle
only
one
at
a
time
you
can
always
tell
when
this
happens
by
the
ferret
working
a
long
time
and
bolting
no
rats
now
immediately
you
notice
this
put
your
mouth
near
the
hole
where
you
have
put
the
ferrets
in
and
make
a
squealing
noise
with
your
mouth
to
imitate
a
squealing
rat
this
causes
the
heap
of
rats
at
the
end
of
the
joist
to
disperse
through
fear
and
when
they
get
running
about
they
will
bolt
into
the
net
many
times
i
have
not
had
a
bolt
for
and
when
i
have
squealed
at
the
hole
i
have
had
four
or
five
rats
in
the
nets
at
once
these
are
some
of
the
methods
of
clearing
rats
from
various
places
and
from
experience
i
think
they
excel
all
others
part
ii
how
to
keep
and
work
ferrets
the
first
necessity
in
is
that
they
shall
be
kept
in
hutches
or
cotes
as
they
are
commonly
called
care
must
always
be
taken
to
have
their
places
well
swilled
with
carbolic
water
and
then
allowed
to
thoroughly
dry
before
whitewashing
the
inside
which
is
also
essential
to
keep
them
healthy
this
should
be
done
at
least
four
times
a
year
always
have
your
hutches
leaning
from
the
wall
so
that
wet
or
refuse
will
not
lodge
for
when
the
bottom
of
a
hutch
is
always
wet
it
is
liable
to
give
the
ferrets
a
disease
called
foot
rot
which
is
very
frequent
where
ferrets
are
neglected
always
keep
the
feeding
part
of
the
hutch
well
covered
with
sawdust
in
feeding
ferrets
for
the
purpose
of
never
do
so
before
going
out
with
them
i
think
it
is
quite
sufficient
to
feed
them
every
hours
if
you
feed
them
oftener
they
are
liable
to
get
too
fat
and
also
lazy
and
unwilling
to
work
as
they
should
the
best
food
you
can
give
them
is
bread
and
milk
and
occasionally
a
little
raw
liver
mix
the
bread
and
milk
with
a
little
hot
water
stir
well
with
a
spoon
or
squeeze
through
your
fingers
so
that
the
ferrets
will
have
to
eat
it
where
you
feed
them
if
not
they
will
carry
the
large
pieces
of
bread
that
are
wet
into
the
corners
of
the
sleeping
place
which
would
soon
cause
that
part
of
the
hutch
to
smell
very
sour
and
become
injurious
to
the
health
of
the
ferret
especially
where
four
or
five
are
kept
together
as
they
are
of
a
very
perspiring
nature
always
give
them
plenty
of
room
to
run
about
when
you
can
if
you
do
they
are
likely
to
take
cramp
ferrets
are
usually
subject
to
distemper
the
first
symptom
is
the
ferret
neglect
of
its
food
when
you
see
this
you
will
observe
a
little
matter
at
the
corner
of
the
eyes
and
the
ferret
will
have
a
slight
running
at
the
nostrils
immediately
you
see
these
symptoms
separate
that
ferret
from
the
others
as
this
is
i
think
the
worst
disease
one
has
to
contend
with
in
the
whole
of
my
experience
i
have
found
distemper
if
caught
in
time
can
be
cured
but
if
it
gets
too
far
i
know
of
no
cure
for
it
i
have
known
a
gamekeeper
to
have
dogs
with
the
distemper
and
he
has
not
touched
his
ferrets
or
handled
them
at
all
during
the
time
his
dogs
were
bad
yet
a
week
afterwards
his
ferrets
caught
the
disease
he
tried
all
the
remedies
he
knew
of
but
in
days
hitherto
good
strong
healthy
ferrets
died
all
he
had
this
will
show
at
once
that
the
disease
is
very
contagious
the
moment
you
see
signs
of
distemper
coming
on
feed
the
ferret
as
little
as
possible
give
it
as
little
to
eat
as
will
just
keep
life
in
it
for
in
feeding
the
ferret
you
also
feed
the
disease
when
you
have
kept
the
food
from
it
is
the
time
to
start
curing
if
possible
now
from
experience
the
first
thing
i
recommend
is
to
sweat
the
disease
out
of
it
and
i
find
the
best
way
to
do
this
is
as
follows
get
an
old
bucket
with
a
few
holes
bored
in
the
bottom
and
almost
fill
it
with
good
new
straw
put
a
little
hay
on
the
top
of
the
droppings
and
then
put
the
ferret
on
the
hay
place
or
hang
the
bucket
over
a
boiler
or
on
the
mantelpiece
and
let
the
kettle
steam
under
the
bucket
say
for
minutes
and
you
will
find
the
steam
and
the
ammonia
from
the
droppings
will
together
sweat
the
disease
out
of
the
ferret
then
you
can
start
feeding
it
again
feed
it
with
something
substantial
such
as
the
jelly
from
stewed
cowheels
give
them
the
jelly
only
not
the
meat
and
you
will
have
a
good
result
also
give
them
a
teaspoonful
of
cream
this
is
the
one
and
only
cure
for
distemper
another
disease
in
ferrets
especially
young
ones
is
what
i
call
red
mange
this
starts
always
under
the
belly
and
you
will
find
that
the
skin
becomes
very
red
and
speckled
this
is
easily
remedied
by
the
simple
process
of
washing
in
lukewarm
water
and
rubbing
with
sweet
oil
and
black
sulphur
the
same
mixture
will
answer
for
foot
rot
if
rubbed
well
into
the
paws
the
general
cause
of
this
latter
disease
is
neglect
of
the
ferrets
and
the
hutches
not
being
cleaned
out
regularly
i
think
the
best
bedding
for
ferrets
is
good
oat
straw
fresh
every
fortnight
throw
the
straw
in
carelessly
and
the
ferrets
will
make
their
own
beds
when
breeding
ferrets
never
go
near
them
more
than
you
can
help
as
they
are
of
a
wild
nature
and
liable
to
destroy
their
young
when
you
know
a
jill
or
bitch
ferret
has
young
give
her
a
little
extra
good
food
but
do
interfere
with
the
young
ones
on
any
account
and
if
you
want
to
give
her
a
little
extra
bedding
put
the
straw
in
the
same
place
as
the
food
and
she
will
take
it
into
the
sleeping
place
herself
it
is
advisable
not
to
touch
the
young
ones
for
five
weeks
or
better
still
leave
them
until
they
come
out
to
feed
themselves
and
when
running
about
if
there
be
a
good
number
say
nine
or
ten
in
the
lot
it
is
a
good
plan
to
remove
them
into
a
larger
place
for
sleeping
as
young
ferrets
are
very
liable
to
catch
the
red
mange
which
arises
from
too
many
being
together
and
sweating
very
much
when
working
ferrets
for
always
work
them
unmuzzled
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
as
rats
are
very
bad
to
bolt
sometimes
never
grab
at
the
ferret
as
it
leaves
the
hole
nor
tempt
it
out
of
the
hole
with
a
dead
rat
the
best
way
is
to
let
the
ferret
come
out
of
its
own
choice
and
then
pick
it
up
very
quietly
for
if
you
grab
at
it
it
is
likely
to
become
what
we
call
a
stopper
and
never
on
any
account
force
a
ferret
to
go
into
a
hole
when
working
ferrets
for
always
muzzle
them
the
style
of
muzzle
is
i
think
the
best
that
is
made
with
string
i
do
approve
of
wire
muzzles
as
they
are
liable
to
catch
against
tree
roots
and
bits
of
sharp
stones
and
from
experience
i
find
the
ferret
works
much
better
with
the
string
muzzle
there
is
one
way
of
working
ferrets
when
which
if
followed
i
think
would
lead
to
a
better
day
shooting
you
will
often
see
the
ferrets
stick
up
with
the
rabbits
now
in
most
cases
the
gamekeeper
or
his
man
working
the
ferrets
will
often
cut
open
a
dead
rabbit
and
put
the
paunch
to
the
burrow
i
quite
agree
as
to
the
desirability
of
this
to
get
the
ferrets
out
but
i
say
that
the
man
using
the
ferrets
ought
never
to
touch
the
paunch
as
the
ferrets
will
not
work
half
so
well
after
he
has
the
smell
of
the
paunch
on
his
hands
another
bad
plan
is
that
of
throwing
a
dead
rabbit
into
the
burrow
so
that
the
ferret
will
follow
it
out
the
best
plan
is
to
let
the
ferret
get
clear
of
the
hole
and
then
pick
it
up
quietly
if
you
will
break
your
ferrets
in
in
this
manner
you
will
never
have
any
trouble
with
them
afterwards
when
ferrets
are
conveyed
about
for
the
purpose
of
rabbiting
boxes
are
much
better
to
use
than
bags
as
the
ferrets
then
get
a
better
chance
of
resting
if
bags
be
used
you
disturb
the
ferrets
rest
and
position
each
time
you
remove
one
take
care
to
observe
this
and
it
will
result
in
a
good
day
sport
always
take
your
ferrets
home
as
quickly
as
possible
after
a
day
work
ferrets
kept
only
for
should
always
be
fed
as
soon
as
the
day
work
is
over
but
they
must
not
have
more
food
till
the
same
time
the
following
day
if
fed
in
this
way
regularly
you
will
find
that
they
will
work
very
well
it
is
also
advisable
to
let
them
drink
at
a
stream
when
they
have
worked
about
three
hours
when
ferrets
have
been
fast
in
a
rabbit
burrow
their
paws
may
be
full
of
down
with
scratching
at
the
rabbits
always
remove
this
before
placing
them
to
another
burrow
each
time
you
handle
the
ferret
see
that
the
muzzle
is
alright
and
in
muzzling
with
string
great
care
should
be
taken
to
remove
the
long
hair
on
the
snout
from
under
the
string
otherwise
the
ferret
may
experience
a
tickling
sensation
and
not
work
so
well
as
it
should
see
also
that
the
string
is
tied
tightly
around
the
neck
if
not
it
can
easily
pull
off
the
muzzle
with
its
paws
whenever
a
ferret
is
severely
bitten
by
a
rat
the
best
course
to
take
immediately
you
get
it
home
is
to
bathe
the
wound
in
clean
water
see
that
all
the
dirt
is
removed
and
then
apply
a
few
drops
of
sweet
oil
to
the
wound
repeat
this
every
four
hours
until
the
wound
is
healed
but
until
then
do
not
work
the
ferret
lest
more
dirt
gets
into
the
wound
my
experience
proves
this
to
be
the
best
way
to
cure
a
ferret
when
it
has
received
a
severe
it
is
also
a
good
plan
occasionally
say
once
a
fortnight
to
skin
a
nice
young
rat
and
give
it
to
the
ferret
suitable
dogs
and
now
a
word
or
two
as
to
what
is
a
good
dog
for
waterside
hunting
or
working
with
the
ferrets
i
recommend
a
dog
but
i
find
that
it
is
always
better
to
have
the
pointer
breed
in
it
whatever
other
breed
you
get
because
the
pointer
always
has
the
nose
or
scent
pointer
and
airedale
would
be
very
good
or
pointer
and
irish
terrier
i
have
often
noticed
that
dogs
are
not
much
good
for
hunting
in
buildings
or
rivers
i
have
frequently
seen
a
dog
stand
at
one
side
of
the
river
and
if
the
wind
has
been
in
his
favour
he
has
winded
his
nose
across
the
river
and
i
have
sent
him
over
and
he
has
turned
a
rat
out
bolted
it
into
the
water
and
killed
it
the
best
precaution
to
take
in
breaking
a
dog
to
and
waterside
hunting
especially
if
it
be
a
puppy
is
to
never
allow
anybody
but
yourself
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
it
being
the
worst
thing
possible
to
let
a
working
dog
have
too
many
masters
break
it
in
to
the
ferrets
first
and
then
it
is
a
good
plan
to
go
up
the
river
banks
with
either
a
dead
rat
or
rabbit
skin
letting
the
dog
play
with
it
for
a
while
and
then
burying
it
about
inches
in
the
river
bank
or
you
may
pull
up
a
clod
and
put
it
under
only
you
must
not
let
the
dog
see
where
you
place
it
then
take
the
dog
with
you
near
to
where
the
rat
or
skin
is
buried
and
you
will
soon
see
that
the
dog
knows
its
work
do
this
a
few
times
and
you
will
see
that
once
the
dog
finds
the
dead
rat
or
the
skin
it
will
never
forget
the
younger
the
dog
the
better
the
right
age
to
break
a
puppy
this
way
being
about
four
or
five
months
break
it
in
for
taking
to
the
water
at
the
same
time
if
you
want
a
good
working
dog
always
keep
it
on
the
chain
when
at
home
and
feed
it
at
the
same
time
as
the
ferrets
but
do
not
it
also
give
it
one
dose
of
castor
oil
or
syrup
of
buckthorn
every
days
i
recommend
this
because
you
never
know
the
nasty
poisonous
stuff
that
the
dog
gets
on
its
stomach
from
the
dirty
brook
and
river
sides
let
me
add
that
all
i
have
written
about
ferrets
and
dogs
are
not
given
merely
from
hearsay
but
are
the
facts
derived
from
study
and
experience
during
years
of
dog
and
part
iii
the
habits
of
rats
rats
breed
very
quickly
this
i
have
often
proved
by
visiting
a
given
haunt
for
many
years
together
i
remember
an
instance
in
point
one
june
when
out
with
dog
and
ferrets
the
dog
made
a
set
under
the
root
of
a
tree
i
put
the
ferret
in
and
it
bolted
eight
young
rats
nearly
half
grown
still
suckling
the
bitch
rat
when
the
old
rat
bolted
my
dog
killed
it
and
whilst
the
dog
was
shaking
it
i
found
she
was
very
heavy
in
young
again
this
therefore
will
prove
how
quickly
rats
breed
another
result
of
my
observation
may
be
of
interest
to
my
readers
after
removing
a
lot
of
old
rubbish
when
ratting
i
came
upon
a
nest
of
born
rats
and
in
curiosity
i
cut
the
tails
off
the
lot
and
then
put
the
young
rodents
back
leaving
the
nest
undisturbed
when
i
returned
next
day
i
found
the
old
rat
had
carried
all
her
young
away
and
later
i
found
the
same
tailless
lot
in
another
part
of
the
building
and
after
disturbing
them
again
i
found
the
following
day
that
the
bitch
rat
had
killed
every
one
by
eating
off
their
heads
this
destruction
of
the
offspring
i
have
witnessed
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
old
bitch
rat
has
always
killed
them
in
the
same
way
by
eating
off
their
heads
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
you
of
the
young
rat
dread
of
the
ferrets
i
have
often
seen
when
the
ferrets
have
been
put
in
the
hole
the
young
rats
not
many
days
old
and
their
eyes
yet
unopened
creep
out
of
the
hole
this
is
a
proof
that
the
smell
of
the
ferrets
has
a
tendency
to
bolt
rats
either
young
or
old
old
rats
are
very
bold
whilst
suckling
their
young
i
have
seen
them
very
venturesome
to
get
to
water
and
more
eager
for
water
than
for
food
i
have
often
traced
their
runs
a
long
way
for
water
and
noticed
that
when
crossing
a
field
to
get
to
a
pit
or
river
they
never
walk
but
are
always
on
the
run
and
in
the
summer
when
they
reach
the
pit
they
not
only
drink
but
often
swim
about
i
have
frequently
watched
them
swimming
on
a
moonlight
night
but
they
generally
go
back
to
the
buildings
in
the
early
morning
especially
in
the
winter
months
another
habit
i
have
often
noticed
take
a
farm
or
any
place
where
there
are
many
rats
and
it
will
be
always
found
that
when
a
rat
gets
very
old
it
becomes
very
greyish
in
colour
and
rather
scabbed
and
its
hair
comes
off
mostly
on
the
back
the
healthy
rats
will
then
drive
the
old
rat
away
and
these
scabby
old
rats
may
be
caught
by
themselves
in
other
parts
of
the
buildings
and
further
i
often
notice
that
if
the
ferrets
are
bitten
with
these
old
rats
they
take
bad
ways
i
never
put
such
rats
with
the
others
nor
allow
my
dog
to
kill
them
i
would
advise
any
gentleman
having
a
dog
he
values
never
to
let
it
touch
one
of
these
old
scabby
rats
as
it
may
prove
injurious
to
the
health
of
the
dog
it
is
surprising
how
far
rats
will
travel
in
the
night
i
have
traced
their
tracks
from
a
stackyard
over
two
or
three
fields
to
a
farm
to
get
to
their
food
and
you
will
always
find
that
they
have
one
time
for
feeding
which
is
as
soon
as
it
is
dusk
the
young
rats
being
the
most
venturesome
for
their
food
always
coming
out
first
rats
especially
stackyard
ones
are
of
a
very
clean
nature
you
will
find
that
after
they
have
had
their
first
feed
they
diligently
wash
themselves
these
rats
feed
on
nothing
but
good
stuff
such
as
wheat
corn
and
meal
and
from
experience
i
find
that
if
a
man
is
bitten
on
the
hand
by
one
of
these
brown
or
stack
rats
it
never
takes
bad
ways
but
if
bitten
by
a
dirty
drain
rat
then
whether
he
cauterises
or
bathes
the
wound
is
no
matter
it
is
sure
to
take
bad
ways
i
think
the
reason
of
this
is
because
the
drain
rat
when
it
can
not
get
anything
else
to
eat
exists
on
the
worms
and
slugs
and
this
i
think
causes
the
teeth
to
become
more
venomous
when
bitten
in
this
way
blood
poisoning
is
very
likely
to
ensue
indeed
you
must
understand
that
the
teeth
of
a
grown
rat
are
quite
long
and
the
jaw
is
very
strong
so
that
if
you
are
bitten
on
the
finger
it
is
almost
sure
to
penetrate
to
the
bone
i
have
known
a
good
many
cases
of
blood
poisoning
through
bites
the
damage
rats
can
do
to
property
commodities
is
almost
incredible
i
have
had
so
many
examples
of
this
that
i
scarcely
know
which
to
submit
as
illustration
i
think
the
worst
case
i
have
seen
was
where
they
gnawed
a
hole
half
way
through
a
inch
lead
pipe
and
often
i
have
known
them
to
bite
through
a
lead
pipe
the
worst
damage
is
done
when
they
get
under
the
flag
floors
of
cottage
houses
out
of
the
drains
they
scratch
the
soil
from
beneath
the
flags
which
then
sink
and
the
consequent
stench
from
the
drains
is
abominable
jeopardising
the
health
of
the
tenants
i
have
seen
a
great
many
of
these
cases
in
the
poorer
parts
of
manchester
the
damage
the
rats
will
do
in
the
silk
and
similar
trades
to
the
goods
of
merchants
or
in
the
grocery
business
is
enormous
and
not
so
much
by
reason
of
what
they
actually
eat
as
by
what
they
carry
away
which
is
often
ten
times
as
much
as
they
eat
i
have
often
proved
this
when
ferreting
at
a
wholesale
grocery
warehouse
when
we
have
taken
up
the
boards
between
the
laths
and
plaster
we
have
found
the
ceiling
almost
full
of
lump
sugar
nuts
candles
which
have
been
there
for
years
hoarded
by
the
rats
now
this
all
means
heavy
loss
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
any
business
man
so
suffering
ought
to
engage
the
services
of
a
professional
once
a
year
in
order
to
keep
the
rats
down
and
catch
as
many
as
possible
before
they
begin
breeding
another
rat
habit
may
be
noticed
where
the
rodents
are
accustomed
to
have
their
holes
and
runs
among
flags
and
stones
if
they
find
any
soft
wood
such
as
pine
or
white
deal
they
will
nibble
at
it
until
it
is
eaten
through
i
have
often
known
them
to
eat
right
through
the
legs
of
tables
in
the
middle
of
cooking
kitchens
this
i
think
they
do
simply
to
keep
their
teeth
clean
and
in
order
i
have
known
rats
to
do
the
same
rats
can
exist
a
long
time
on
herbage
if
they
can
get
nothing
more
palatable
it
is
a
very
common
thing
to
find
rats
in
the
rabbit
burrows
when
ferreting
in
fact
i
have
seen
not
once
but
many
times
rats
rabbits
and
weasels
all
bolt
from
the
same
burrow
i
have
also
unearthed
a
rat
and
a
rabbit
together
out
of
one
single
burrow
now
as
to
keeping
rats
in
store
cages
at
home
look
well
after
them
and
i
think
it
is
possible
to
keep
them
alive
for
quite
a
year
but
if
you
keep
say
in
one
store
cage
and
neglect
their
feeding
you
will
find
that
when
hungry
in
the
night
they
will
kill
the
weakest
of
their
number
and
eat
it
sometimes
even
eating
two
or
three
in
one
night
leaving
the
skin
as
clean
as
if
a
man
had
skinned
them
it
is
always
the
best
plan
to
put
the
rats
in
different
cages
according
to
their
sizes
the
young
ones
together
the
old
ones
together
and
the
ones
together
as
they
keep
themselves
much
cleaner
when
thus
divided
and
do
not
fight
so
much
as
they
would
otherwise
they
must
also
be
kept
in
a
warm
place
if
not
they
soon
have
cramp
also
keep
them
in
a
dark
place
and
see
that
they
have
plenty
of
water
sprinkle
them
now
and
then
with
it
so
that
they
will
wash
themselves
it
is
astonishing
what
a
hungry
rat
will
do
i
have
seen
them
in
the
summer
at
dusk
run
at
an
old
hen
with
her
chickens
under
her
and
almost
as
quick
as
i
tell
it
the
rat
has
snatched
a
live
chicken
and
run
with
it
under
a
pigsty
floor
i
have
known
them
to
take
young
ducks
from
the
water
side
i
remember
once
ferreting
round
a
pit
near
a
barn
and
when
i
put
my
ferret
in
the
hole
it
pulled
out
two
dead
chickens
and
three
dead
ducks
and
behind
them
not
more
than
a
yard
deep
in
the
pit
bank
was
an
old
rat
i
have
also
known
them
to
get
into
the
coops
where
a
gamekeeper
was
rearing
his
pheasants
and
to
kill
nine
young
ones
in
a
single
night
all
from
under
the
same
hen
rats
are
also
fond
of
eggs
i
have
read
of
many
ways
in
which
rats
take
eggs
but
in
my
experience
of
ratting
i
never
saw
rats
take
eggs
save
in
one
way
and
that
is
dragging
or
rolling
them
along
the
floor
with
their
front
paws
until
they
get
them
to
the
mouth
of
the
hole
i
remember
one
place
where
i
was
ferreting
there
was
an
old
cellar
the
door
of
which
at
the
top
of
the
steps
had
to
my
knowledge
been
nailed
up
two
or
three
years
out
of
the
hen
house
the
rats
had
eaten
a
hole
at
each
side
of
the
cellar
door
at
the
bottom
one
day
we
burst
open
the
door
went
into
the
cellar
where
it
was
impossible
for
a
hen
to
get
whilst
the
door
was
closed
and
beneath
the
bottom
step
we
caught
two
rats
on
lifting
the
flag
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
we
found
whole
eggs
some
good
and
some
bad
all
of
which
i
am
quite
satisfied
the
rats
had
carried
down
those
nine
stone
steps
how
they
had
done
so
i
can
not
explain
but
content
myself
with
stating
only
the
plain
facts
of
my
own
personal
observation
rats
are
also
very
cunning
in
the
water
say
a
pit
or
a
river
now
a
rat
can
exist
in
water
for
at
most
about
seven
minutes
and
you
will
find
when
a
dog
is
swimming
after
a
rat
that
the
rat
is
watching
the
dog
all
the
time
for
as
soon
as
the
dog
gets
within
a
yard
of
the
rat
the
latter
will
dive
under
water
and
come
to
the
surface
again
about
yards
away
when
the
dog
has
tired
the
rat
out
with
swimming
you
will
very
often
see
the
rat
dive
again
and
come
up
very
quietly
and
just
put
its
nose
out
of
the
water
or
rest
its
head
on
a
floating
leaf
it
is
so
cunning
that
it
will
remain
still
there
and
if
the
leaf
or
reed
gives
way
it
will
come
up
at
the
water
side
and
just
thrust
out
its
nose
to
breathe
by
this
means
the
dog
loses
full
scent
of
the
rat
i
have
also
noticed
how
useful
are
the
rat
front
paws
and
tail
i
have
seen
a
rat
on
the
top
of
a
swill
tub
at
a
pigsty
when
the
swill
has
been
about
ten
inches
from
the
top
of
the
tub
the
rat
was
too
cunning
to
jump
down
on
the
wet
swill
and
drown
but
i
saw
it
reach
as
far
down
the
inside
of
the
tub
as
possible
with
its
front
paws
and
scrape
the
grease
from
around
the
sides
i
have
also
seen
the
same
rat
when
unable
to
scrape
any
further
down
the
tub
sides
turn
round
clutch
the
top
of
the
tub
with
its
front
paws
dip
its
tail
into
the
swill
and
then
gain
the
top
of
the
tub
and
commence
licking
its
tail
i
have
also
tried
an
experiment
with
the
same
tub
which
consisted
of
covering
the
top
of
the
wet
swill
with
bran
which
floated
on
the
surface
and
placing
a
bit
of
lumpy
swill
in
the
middle
of
the
bran
in
the
hope
that
the
rat
would
jump
on
the
bran
in
the
expectation
of
getting
at
the
swill
in
the
middle
however
it
did
not
do
so
no
doubt
instinctively
guided
against
the
danger
i
have
also
watched
rats
run
round
a
set
wire
or
cage
trap
for
a
full
hour
i
have
seen
them
go
half
way
in
and
out
again
look
at
the
bait
and
never
touch
it
but
go
away
and
never
return
to
the
same
trap
that
night
these
examples
show
the
cunning
instinct
of
rats
there
is
however
one
power
that
the
rat
is
not
favoured
with
and
i
am
afraid
if
they
were
they
would
be
a
greater
pest
it
is
the
ability
of
high
jumping
a
rat
can
not
i
think
jump
higher
than
three
feet
six
inches
and
will
have
to
be
very
hungry
before
doing
that
to
obtain
food
many
people
may
not
know
how
fierce
rats
are
when
fighting
let
me
instance
i
have
often
taken
one
in
each
hand
two
good
rats
from
my
cage
before
a
hundred
spectators
and
set
the
rats
at
each
other
on
the
top
of
a
table
to
see
them
fight
would
be
surprising
they
will
fight
like
two
bulldogs
when
they
have
got
a
grip
of
each
other
with
their
teeth
i
have
taken
away
my
hands
and
they
have
stuck
and
shook
one
another
for
at
least
although
you
must
understand
that
the
moment
they
are
loose
of
one
another
they
are
off
if
you
do
catch
them
again
there
are
several
other
cunning
ways
of
rats
which
i
can
scarcely
explain
one
must
be
amongst
them
regularly
to
know
their
wonderful
ways
and
habits
yet
another
little
incident
in
conclusion
may
be
of
interest
i
once
called
at
a
farm
where
they
had
been
threshing
a
wheat
stack
a
had
been
there
but
without
a
dog
and
when
i
arrived
two
hours
afterwards
my
dog
made
a
set
and
commenced
scratching
amongst
the
old
chaff
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
stack
and
to
the
astonishment
of
myself
and
the
farmer
i
pulled
out
of
the
hole
where
the
dog
was
scratching
live
rats
the
other
who
had
been
at
the
threshing
all
day
had
caught
only
rats
this
will
serve
to
show
that
a
must
not
be
without
a
good
dog
and
now
respecting
the
ways
and
habits
of
rats
i
think
i
have
given
my
readers
interesting
and
varied
illustrations
of
what
i
have
seen
and
experienced
during
my
time
part
iv
life
of
the
this
work
will
not
be
complete
if
i
do
not
deal
with
the
life
the
profession
is
a
peculiar
and
exciting
one
but
all
right
if
pursued
in
the
right
way
although
the
calling
takes
one
into
dirty
and
obnoxious
places
there
is
no
reason
why
the
should
not
always
appear
respectable
the
has
many
temptations
to
dishonest
conducts
for
instance
when
on
a
farm
or
private
estate
where
there
are
numerous
rabbits
and
game
it
looks
rather
hard
lines
for
the
to
come
off
a
farm
with
his
cage
full
of
rats
and
see
rabbits
running
about
whilst
he
has
all
the
requisites
in
his
possession
for
catching
them
and
yet
he
must
not
touch
one
but
go
home
and
merely
reflect
on
what
a
good
sunday
dinner
he
is
leaving
behind
this
i
have
experienced
many
a
time
but
i
have
always
found
even
from
the
business
that
the
old
advice
still
remains
true
honesty
is
the
best
policy
leaving
the
rabbits
to
themselves
has
always
turned
out
to
be
the
best
for
to
take
a
rabbit
worth
a
shilling
and
get
caught
in
the
act
means
that
you
can
never
go
on
the
same
estate
again
and
from
that
same
estate
you
might
have
got
rats
in
a
year
worth
four
shillings
a
dozen
i
must
also
put
in
a
good
word
here
for
the
gamekeepers
my
opinion
is
that
if
you
go
on
a
keeper
ground
and
do
what
is
right
you
will
be
able
to
go
again
for
in
the
whole
of
my
experience
never
having
carried
any
nets
but
rat
nets
when
on
private
estates
i
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
i
should
always
be
welcome
on
going
again
to
such
estates
of
course
there
are
inconveniences
that
the
has
to
put
up
with
whatever
engagements
he
takes
in
a
town
the
only
time
he
can
catch
rats
with
a
good
result
is
in
the
night
on
one
occasion
when
going
round
with
my
lamp
to
examine
the
traps
i
was
taken
for
a
burglar
by
the
policeman
on
the
beat
and
he
doubted
me
so
much
that
he
would
not
release
me
until
i
had
shown
him
my
cage
with
rats
in
and
my
traps
set
all
over
the
place
then
he
took
almost
as
much
interest
in
the
catching
of
rats
as
myself
and
also
brought
in
the
other
policemen
who
were
outside
waiting
for
me
to
attempt
an
escape
ever
after
that
when
i
had
a
night
engagement
in
any
town
i
always
went
to
the
police
station
to
tell
the
man
on
that
beat
where
i
was
it
behoves
the
to
be
always
attentive
to
his
customers
those
i
mean
who
want
live
rats
wherewith
to
try
their
dogs
amongst
mine
i
have
the
honour
to
include
clients
of
highest
rank
and
position
barristers
magistrates
solicitors
and
a
host
of
sporting
gentry
if
the
efforts
commend
themselves
to
such
gentlemen
and
he
always
maintains
a
respectable
appearance
he
will
obtain
some
very
nice
outings
in
the
country
a
party
of
gentlemen
have
sent
for
me
in
the
summer
having
arranged
with
me
to
bring
four
or
five
ferrets
and
ratting
appliances
and
we
have
gone
miles
up
the
country
they
would
bring
their
terrier
dogs
and
we
would
hunt
all
along
the
brooks
and
rivers
and
round
the
corn
and
wheat
fields
putting
the
rats
we
caught
into
the
cage
and
after
lunch
taking
the
rats
to
a
meadow
and
coursing
them
with
their
dogs
which
i
think
it
real
good
sport
we
would
put
up
at
the
best
hotels
and
repeat
the
procedure
next
day
very
often
taking
a
drag
or
coach
and
driving
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
farther
up
the
country
i
can
assure
my
readers
that
the
is
well
remunerated
for
the
trouble
he
undertakes
in
these
cases
and
moreover
this
is
the
class
of
people
he
requires
to
fraternise
with
there
is
always
a
plentiful
supply
of
refreshments
on
these
outings
and
i
would
therefore
advise
the
not
to
indulge
too
freely
the
foregoing
is
of
course
a
brief
sketch
of
the
pleasantest
part
of
a
life
and
to
complete
the
picture
i
may
as
well
describe
some
of
the
other
features
and
the
way
he
has
to
rough
it
sometimes
well
are
generally
called
upon
to
supply
rats
for
the
rat
coursings
usually
held
at
beerhouses
on
saturday
afternoons
which
one
often
sees
advertised
now
if
he
binds
himself
to
supply
a
coursing
at
a
certain
date
the
bills
announcing
the
event
are
printed
and
posted
all
of
which
means
expense
then
you
are
bound
to
secure
the
live
rats
whatever
be
the
weather
in
doing
this
i
always
followed
the
threshing
machine
to
the
bays
and
stacks
anyone
that
catches
rats
regularly
can
tell
by
looking
at
the
bays
or
stacks
whether
there
are
many
rats
in
or
not
i
remember
many
times
when
the
men
have
started
threshing
a
bay
of
wheat
in
which
were
a
great
many
rats
and
by
dark
they
have
threshed
only
half
of
the
bay
at
such
times
the
must
not
leave
the
remaining
half
no
not
for
throughout
the
whole
night
for
if
he
does
the
rats
will
run
out
to
stop
the
rats
from
leaving
the
catcher
has
to
lie
on
the
top
of
the
bay
or
go
about
every
thirty
minutes
and
beat
the
bottom
with
sticks
until
daylight
in
order
to
keep
the
rats
in
then
after
the
machine
and
the
bottom
of
the
bay
is
reached
the
will
be
well
paid
for
his
trouble
for
he
may
get
say
good
rats
for
the
coursing
at
six
shillings
per
dozen
the
reason
i
call
them
good
coursing
rats
is
because
they
have
not
been
handled
and
that
enables
them
to
run
well
now
when
you
go
to
these
coursings
which
are
mostly
in
the
colliery
districts
you
will
find
about
dogs
entered
it
is
the
business
to
measure
and
handicap
the
dogs
and
a
very
unpleasant
job
it
is
he
has
also
to
be
the
referee
at
these
coursings
and
if
it
is
a
near
thing
with
two
dogs
running
at
one
rat
and
you
decide
to
award
the
victory
to
a
given
one
then
the
owner
of
the
other
dog
will
probably
accuse
you
of
and
favouritism
then
is
the
time
the
has
to
be
prepared
to
pull
off
his
coat
and
start
fighting
before
perhaps
spectators
this
has
often
occurred
with
me
this
i
can
assure
my
readers
is
what
i
call
roughing
it
of
course
what
i
have
just
related
occurred
a
few
years
ago
but
when
the
muzzling
order
came
into
force
the
authorities
practically
stopped
rat
coursing
for
they
would
not
let
a
dog
run
at
a
rat
unless
the
dog
was
muzzled
this
was
about
the
worst
thing
that
the
authorities
could
do
for
manchester
and
district
for
at
that
time
i
was
supplying
for
coursings
about
rats
per
week
and
at
the
same
time
sending
rats
a
week
into
yorkshire
and
all
the
rats
i
supplied
were
caught
within
miles
of
manchester
this
in
my
opinion
speaks
very
bad
of
the
muzzling
order
which
i
think
is
nothing
but
a
farce
for
at
the
very
time
i
was
going
ratting
dogs
were
muzzled
in
some
parts
of
the
country
but
not
in
others
my
opinion
of
dog
muzzling
is
muzzle
all
or
muzzle
none
you
will
see
by
what
i
have
said
respecting
these
coursings
that
the
has
plenty
of
work
to
supply
so
many
live
rats
and
he
has
also
to
mix
with
company
high
and
low
he
also
sometimes
experiences
difficulties
in
travelling
on
the
railway
i
have
often
entered
an
empty
carriage
sent
my
dog
under
the
seat
and
put
the
rat
cage
there
also
the
carriage
would
fill
with
passengers
and
upon
reaching
my
destination
i
would
take
from
under
the
seat
my
cage
full
of
live
rats
to
the
amusement
of
some
and
the
disgust
of
others
i
have
also
entered
a
railway
carriage
with
my
cage
of
rats
when
there
were
passengers
in
one
or
two
of
whom
would
generally
object
to
live
rats
being
in
the
same
compartment
and
on
enquiring
of
the
railway
officials
i
have
found
that
any
one
travelling
with
live
rats
is
expected
to
put
them
in
the
guard
van
i
have
also
had
a
few
good
customers
in
my
business
one
or
two
in
particular
gentlemen
have
often
sent
me
instructing
me
to
take
six
or
twelve
rats
to
their
residences
i
would
run
them
out
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
with
their
dogs
and
generally
i
have
received
good
remuneration
for
my
trouble
these
are
the
customers
who
should
be
looked
well
after
for
they
are
the
sportsmen
who
do
not
consider
expense
though
of
course
there
are
others
who
are
just
the
opposite
further
is
a
business
in
which
one
is
not
called
upon
to
allow
credit
it
is
all
a
trade
and
as
there
is
not
much
competition
the
can
command
a
good
price
for
his
work
he
has
always
one
resource
open
to
him
when
he
has
finished
a
job
according
to
contract
catching
say
or
rats
should
there
be
a
dispute
about
the
price
and
the
people
decline
to
pay
the
bill
then
he
has
the
expedient
of
letting
the
rats
at
liberty
again
in
the
place
where
he
had
caught
them
most
people
will
pay
the
price
you
send
in
rather
than
have
the
rats
turned
loose
again
although
i
am
showing
how
the
can
always
have
the
advantage
of
stubborn
payers
i
may
as
well
assure
my
readers
that
in
all
my
experience
such
an
occurrence
as
the
above
has
never
happened
with
me
simply
because
i
always
make
my
arrangements
beforehand
which
course
i
always
find
the
best
and
most
satisfactory
all
round
another
matter
i
may
mention
if
any
one
could
find
out
a
sure
way
of
catching
rats
so
that
he
could
give
a
guarantee
to
clear
large
buildings
my
opinion
is
that
he
would
make
a
fortune
in
a
very
short
time
for
i
know
firms
in
manchester
alone
that
would
pay
almost
any
amount
to
be
rid
of
the
rats
not
only
because
of
what
they
consume
but
more
for
the
damage
they
do
to
their
goods
i
have
referred
to
the
obtaining
good
pay
the
reason
he
commands
such
a
big
price
for
his
work
at
the
present
time
is
because
there
is
not
much
sale
for
live
rats
the
trade
is
not
what
it
was
some
years
ago
when
were
allowed
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
worst
things
they
ever
did
for
this
country
when
the
authorities
stopped
the
rat
pits
for
when
rat
killing
was
allowed
in
pits
it
was
a
common
thing
for
a
to
receive
an
order
for
rats
all
to
be
killed
at
one
time
then
the
would
get
the
rats
and
wherever
he
got
them
from
he
was
ridding
that
district
of
a
nuisance
but
when
the
authorities
stopped
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
left
the
rats
to
breed
in
thousands
rats
being
vermin
i
do
see
why
they
should
not
be
killed
or
at
a
time
in
the
pit
but
the
humane
society
maintain
that
it
is
cruelty
to
dogs
to
put
them
in
a
pit
with
a
lot
of
rats
i
do
see
where
the
cruelty
comes
in
but
from
what
i
have
seen
of
during
my
time
i
approve
of
them
and
i
think
if
they
were
in
existence
again
there
would
be
a
clearing
of
many
thousands
of
rats
some
or
years
since
i
supplied
rats
in
one
week
all
to
be
killed
in
many
of
my
readers
may
not
understand
what
a
is
and
so
i
will
just
give
an
outline
as
well
as
i
can
the
is
of
circular
construction
say
ten
feet
diameter
and
about
four
feet
six
inches
deep
the
sides
being
perfectly
smooth
to
prevent
the
rats
climbing
up
and
making
their
escape
a
certain
number
of
rats
are
placed
in
the
pit
according
to
the
arrangements
made
with
the
owner
of
the
dog
then
the
dog
is
put
in
the
pit
with
the
rats
to
kill
them
which
a
good
dog
does
very
quickly
the
reason
the
pit
is
built
circular
is
so
that
the
rats
will
keep
running
round
for
if
it
were
square
they
would
all
run
in
a
corner
one
on
the
other
and
then
the
dog
would
have
no
difficulty
in
killing
them
it
is
better
to
have
the
pit
fairly
deep
if
not
the
rats
might
escape
i
think
the
best
dog
within
my
recollection
that
i
have
seen
was
a
bull
and
fox
terrier
which
killed
good
rats
in
three
minutes
and
seconds
i
have
read
and
heard
of
dogs
doing
better
feats
but
i
am
only
writing
of
what
i
have
myself
seen
i
may
say
that
the
records
for
killing
in
are
held
by
a
dog
called
jacko
which
killed
rats
in
minutes
and
seconds
and
rats
in
less
than
one
hour
and
minutes
the
has
also
some
very
dirty
jobs
to
do
sometimes
often
he
has
to
go
under
all
sorts
of
cellar
floors
both
wet
and
dry
but
the
majority
of
places
are
very
wet
and
dirty
for
the
rats
nearly
always
come
out
of
some
filthy
drain
and
very
often
near
a
the
abominable
smell
arising
from
these
places
being
sufficient
to
cause
a
fever
i
remember
being
once
employed
at
a
hospital
and
i
was
paid
at
the
rate
of
per
visit
for
trapping
rats
well
i
found
that
per
visit
did
not
pay
me
i
had
about
traps
set
all
over
the
place
so
i
went
before
the
committee
and
requested
per
night
the
committee
said
they
thought
per
visit
was
enough
and
one
or
two
of
them
said
they
thought
per
night
was
above
a
pay
now
as
i
was
not
depending
on
that
particular
job
at
the
time
i
turned
round
and
told
them
what
i
thought
i
told
them
i
considered
was
a
skilled
occupation
and
i
also
offered
any
of
them
a
note
if
they
would
only
follow
me
under
the
floors
at
midnight
not
to
speak
of
taking
the
live
rats
out
of
the
traps
in
the
dark
but
i
can
assure
you
that
none
of
these
gentlemen
would
venture
to
undertake
the
task
now
if
any
of
these
gentlemen
had
to
do
this
a
few
times
they
would
not
refuse
to
pay
the
the
sum
he
asks
per
night
i
remember
more
than
once
in
big
places
such
as
bonding
warehouses
when
i
have
been
under
the
floors
my
candle
or
lamp
has
gone
out
through
being
knocked
over
with
grabbing
at
rats
and
i
have
not
had
a
match
in
my
pocket
and
have
had
to
grope
about
in
the
dark
trying
to
find
the
where
i
have
got
under
the
floors
more
often
than
not
putting
my
hand
in
a
set
trap
it
would
be
of
no
use
shouting
for
a
light
simply
because
i
have
been
alone
it
is
always
better
for
a
to
have
assistance
for
night
work
but
i
have
done
it
myself
very
often
now
the
expenses
of
travelling
come
very
heavy
sometimes
for
wherever
the
goes
he
always
has
to
pay
railway
fare
for
himself
and
his
dog
another
thing
i
must
tell
you
often
when
i
have
gone
to
inspect
a
small
building
i
have
found
that
there
were
a
great
many
rats
in
but
i
have
also
known
after
inspecting
the
place
that
they
have
all
come
from
the
one
place
out
of
the
drain
well
if
i
have
contracted
to
do
this
job
for
a
lump
sum
i
could
easily
clear
this
place
and
not
catch
an
odd
rat
simply
by
ferreting
them
all
back
into
the
sewer
in
the
daytime
and
then
making
it
good
but
in
most
of
these
cases
they
do
not
like
to
pay
your
bill
because
you
have
caught
no
rats
still
you
have
driven
them
all
down
the
drains
and
after
making
the
drain
good
they
can
not
get
back
again
into
the
building
now
in
a
case
like
this
i
always
trap
them
two
or
three
nights
and
catch
a
few
just
to
give
satisfaction
to
those
engaging
me
sometimes
gentlemen
will
write
inviting
me
to
meet
them
at
a
certain
farm
and
bring
my
ferrets
and
a
good
supply
of
nets
alleging
that
there
are
hundreds
of
rats
in
the
stacks
i
just
relate
this
to
indicate
how
anyone
not
regularly
amongst
rats
can
easily
be
deceived
as
to
their
numbers
for
a
couple
of
rats
on
the
thatch
of
a
stack
especially
when
they
have
young
ones
will
probably
have
twelve
holes
eaten
in
the
thatch
and
underneath
the
stack
and
anyone
not
understanding
their
habits
would
think
there
were
a
lot
of
rats
in
it
and
it
is
much
the
same
with
workpeople
if
they
chance
to
see
two
or
three
rats
at
once
they
will
say
there
are
scores
of
them
you
would
also
be
surprised
to
see
the
awful
dread
that
tenants
have
of
the
catcher
in
private
houses
when
ferreting
these
places
they
think
that
if
a
has
once
put
his
ferrets
under
the
floor
they
will
never
see
another
rat
in
the
place
but
depend
upon
it
they
are
very
bad
to
catch
in
these
places
i
have
often
had
much
trouble
respecting
houses
warehouses
to
know
whose
duty
it
would
be
to
pay
the
for
his
work
the
landlord
or
the
tenant
but
i
think
that
the
landlord
should
pay
i
have
had
many
engagements
to
catch
rats
in
houses
before
they
were
tenanted
the
time
the
rats
get
into
these
places
is
whilst
the
workmen
are
putting
the
drains
in
the
back
yards
leaving
the
drains
open
at
nights
thence
the
rats
come
out
and
get
under
the
floors
sometimes
having
to
stop
there
too
simply
because
the
next
day
the
joiners
board
up
the
floors
and
thus
block
the
rats
in
underneath
and
then
the
rats
can
always
get
into
the
kitchens
up
the
back
of
the
fireplace
most
property
owners
would
do
well
to
take
note
of
this
fact
i
must
tell
my
readers
especially
those
having
large
shops
that
it
is
a
good
plan
if
possible
to
turn
off
the
gas
and
water
every
night
and
for
i
have
seen
a
good
many
cases
where
the
rats
in
the
have
eaten
through
a
and
the
place
has
been
flooded
by
morning
it
is
just
the
same
with
a
and
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
quite
possible
for
fires
to
be
caused
by
rats
in
the
time
rats
are
very
fond
of
nibbling
and
scratching
at
soft
wood
and
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
at
a
grocer
shop
for
a
rat
to
bite
or
scratch
through
the
package
of
a
gross
of
matches
and
ignite
them
and
the
same
cause
may
prove
disastrous
with
any
other
inflammable
goods
respecting
the
conveyance
of
live
rats
the
should
always
be
particular
to
have
good
strong
cages
and
bags
because
if
he
had
a
number
of
rats
in
an
unserviceable
bag
which
happened
to
break
open
at
a
railway
station
or
in
the
street
i
think
he
could
be
summoned
for
the
damage
the
escaped
rats
might
do
still
i
have
not
in
my
time
had
or
heard
of
a
case
of
this
sort
speaking
of
bags
a
good
many
people
seem
to
think
that
if
a
man
puts
his
hand
into
a
bagful
of
rats
they
will
bite
him
but
i
can
assure
you
that
a
child
could
do
the
same
thing
and
not
be
bitten
should
there
be
only
two
or
three
in
the
bag
then
they
will
bite
but
not
in
the
event
of
there
being
a
good
number
the
same
rule
applies
to
rats
stored
in
a
cage
where
there
is
open
daylight
if
there
be
or
rats
together
it
is
then
the
habit
of
the
rats
for
all
to
cling
together
and
they
will
let
you
handle
them
anyway
if
only
you
will
have
sufficient
courage
it
is
very
good
sport
for
gentlemen
who
want
a
good
day
outing
to
go
to
farms
when
threshing
is
on
and
also
to
go
hunting
and
ferreting
round
the
corn
and
wheat
fields
and
i
think
many
sporting
gentlemen
who
have
not
seen
such
sport
would
indulge
in
it
freely
after
they
had
once
witnessed
it
i
think
it
is
much
better
and
healthier
sport
than
shooting
especially
in
the
summer
when
the
farmers
are
cutting
their
corn
and
wheat
when
catching
rats
as
a
regular
pursuit
one
is
surprised
at
the
queer
places
in
which
he
finds
them
i
recollect
ferreting
seven
rats
from
under
the
floor
of
a
built
dog
kennel
not
above
four
yards
square
where
a
large
mastiff
and
a
terrier
dog
slept
every
night
only
a
board
dividing
them
from
the
rats
and
the
rats
having
eaten
holes
through
the
boards
in
the
kennel
i
have
also
found
at
an
an
old
bitch
rat
and
nine
young
ones
in
an
old
tin
trunk
without
a
lid
i
have
also
caught
rats
and
taken
young
ones
out
of
the
nest
from
under
railway
sleepers
where
trains
have
been
running
and
shunting
operations
carried
on
every
day
and
i
have
even
taken
old
and
young
ones
in
their
nest
from
a
pile
of
cheshire
cheese
at
a
wholesale
cheese
and
bacon
factor
and
mentioning
cheese
in
this
connection
reminds
me
that
once
i
discovered
that
rats
had
scratched
and
eaten
a
hole
direct
through
the
bottom
lot
of
cheese
in
a
pile
which
had
only
been
there
three
weeks
a
word
or
two
about
what
a
rat
will
do
with
a
ferret
i
have
often
seen
a
rat
run
a
ferret
out
of
the
hole
and
then
wait
with
its
head
out
of
the
hole
until
the
ferret
has
come
to
it
again
i
remember
once
ferreting
at
a
hencote
and
put
the
ferret
behind
the
hen
nest
whereupon
the
rat
attacked
the
ferret
which
then
jumped
back
and
died
in
five
minutes
the
rats
having
given
only
one
bite
behind
the
ferret
ear
of
course
this
is
a
very
rare
occurrence
true
i
have
had
many
ferrets
killed
by
rats
in
my
time
but
it
has
always
occurred
through
the
poisonous
bite
first
swelling
and
then
taking
bad
ways
the
ferret
dying
in
probably
a
week
or
so
you
must
understand
that
if
you
put
a
rat
and
a
ferret
together
in
a
tub
the
ferret
would
kill
the
rat
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
nature
of
the
rat
being
to
get
away
from
the
ferret
if
possible
but
if
it
can
not
it
will
fight
and
i
think
a
rat
for
its
size
is
of
a
very
vicious
nature
for
i
have
often
seen
when
trying
a
puppy
at
killing
a
rat
in
a
pit
that
a
game
rat
will
run
the
puppy
all
round
the
pit
the
best
way
to
try
a
pup
to
kill
a
rat
is
to
draw
the
teeth
of
the
first
rat
it
secures
for
sometimes
if
a
pup
gets
a
severe
bite
from
a
rat
it
will
never
look
at
another
it
is
a
very
bad
plan
to
let
a
pup
play
with
a
rat
too
much
for
this
causes
the
pup
never
to
put
a
hard
mouth
on
the
rat
when
this
latter
occurs
it
is
the
best
plan
not
to
allow
the
same
pup
to
see
another
rat
until
it
is
a
month
or
two
older
if
you
will
take
care
and
trouble
with
a
pup
you
can
bring
it
up
to
your
own
liking
and
to
do
anything
you
want
i
have
worked
seven
years
with
a
retriever
bitch
and
when
ferreting
a
brook
she
would
stand
in
the
water
and
catch
the
rats
that
escaped
from
the
nets
into
the
brook
and
bring
them
to
me
alive
in
her
mouth
i
have
sold
hundreds
of
rats
she
has
caught
in
this
manner
and
to
show
you
how
the
dogs
can
be
brought
up
with
the
ferrets
i
need
only
mention
that
this
bitch
would
lie
down
and
let
two
ferrets
kill
a
rat
on
the
curly
coat
of
her
back
farmers
know
too
well
of
the
many
restless
nights
the
cows
and
horses
experience
through
rats
i
have
seen
when
trapping
all
night
at
a
farm
the
rats
running
over
the
cows
and
horses
whilst
sleeping
and
when
horses
have
been
working
in
the
field
all
day
they
want
better
rest
in
the
night
i
have
known
when
farmers
would
not
let
the
ferret
their
buildings
gratis
simply
because
they
have
a
few
hens
sitting
they
do
consider
that
when
the
hens
have
hatched
the
eggs
the
rats
will
take
the
chickens
whenever
a
farmer
has
refused
to
let
me
ferret
at
his
farm
i
have
passed
that
farm
ever
afterwards
to
show
you
the
different
dispositions
of
farmers
i
have
met
i
may
mention
that
when
once
ferreting
at
a
farm
we
caught
nine
rats
and
lost
the
ferret
and
two
days
afterwards
the
ferret
was
found
on
the
farm
and
i
sent
for
it
but
the
farmer
demanded
two
shillings
of
me
for
the
ferret
keep
this
same
man
i
may
add
farmed
about
two
hundred
acres
of
course
there
are
other
farmers
just
the
opposite
who
will
not
only
pay
you
for
your
trouble
but
take
great
interest
in
helping
you
to
catch
the
rats
i
relate
these
facts
and
incidents
to
show
you
the
contrast
in
the
disposition
of
different
people
one
meets
in
this
business
i
do
think
the
life
is
one
of
the
worst
if
he
looks
well
after
his
business
for
he
has
a
few
advantages
over
other
occupations
in
the
first
place
he
is
his
own
master
and
need
only
doff
his
coat
when
he
chooses
there
being
for
him
no
such
summons
to
work
as
a
factory
bell
and
if
he
fancies
a
day
outing
in
the
country
he
can
always
take
his
dog
and
ferrets
with
him
and
make
a
day
pleasure
into
a
remunerative
business
by
reason
of
the
income
from
the
rats
and
i
find
from
experience
that
the
best
friends
he
has
are
his
dog
and
ferrets
if
he
will
look
well
after
them
and
treat
them
kindly
for
i
think
that
a
in
the
country
without
a
good
dog
might
walk
over
scores
of
rats
and
never
know
they
were
there
so
you
will
see
that
his
dog
is
chiefly
what
he
has
to
trust
to
and
now
in
conclusion
let
me
express
the
hope
that
this
book
will
prove
instructive
entertaining
and
profitable
to
my
readers
inasmuch
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
it
so
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
within
the
somewhat
limited
scope
and
sphere
of
a
calling
of
course
i
might
have
made
the
narrative
portion
of
the
book
more
startling
and
exciting
had
i
drawn
upon
my
imagination
but
i
have
thought
it
best
to
adhere
to
cold
fact
and
actual
experience
