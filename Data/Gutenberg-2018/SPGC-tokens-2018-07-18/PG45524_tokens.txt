the

a
tale
intended
to
be
after
the
fact
being
the
experience
of
four
men
from
the
sunk
steamer
i
none
of
them
knew
the
colour
of
the
sky
their
eyes
glanced
level
and
were
fastened
upon
the
waves
that
swept
toward
them
these
waves
were
of
the
hue
of
slate
save
for
the
tops
which
were
of
foaming
white
and
all
of
the
men
knew
the
colours
of
the
sea
the
horizon
narrowed
and
widened
and
dipped
and
rose
and
at
all
times
its
edge
was
jagged
with
waves
that
seemed
thrust
up
in
points
like
rocks
many
a
man
ought
to
have
a
larger
than
the
boat
which
here
rode
upon
the
sea
these
waves
were
most
wrongfully
and
barbarously
abrupt
and
tall
and
each
was
a
problem
in
small
boat
navigation
the
cook
squatted
in
the
bottom
and
looked
with
both
eyes
at
the
six
inches
of
gunwale
which
separated
him
from
the
ocean
his
sleeves
were
rolled
over
his
fat
forearms
and
the
two
flaps
of
his
unbuttoned
vest
dangled
as
he
bent
to
bail
out
the
boat
often
he
said
gawd
that
was
a
narrow
clip
as
he
remarked
it
he
invariably
gazed
eastward
over
the
broken
sea
the
oiler
steering
with
one
of
the
two
oars
in
the
boat
sometimes
raised
himself
suddenly
to
keep
clear
of
water
that
swirled
in
over
the
stern
it
was
a
thin
little
oar
and
it
seemed
often
ready
to
snap
the
correspondent
pulling
at
the
other
oar
watched
the
waves
and
wondered
why
he
was
there
the
injured
captain
lying
in
the
bow
was
at
this
time
buried
in
that
profound
dejection
and
indifference
which
comes
temporarily
at
least
to
even
the
bravest
and
most
enduring
when
willy
nilly
the
firm
fails
the
army
loses
the
ship
goes
down
the
mind
of
the
master
of
a
vessel
is
rooted
deep
in
the
timbers
of
her
though
he
commanded
for
a
day
or
a
decade
and
this
captain
had
on
him
the
stern
impression
of
a
scene
in
the
greys
of
dawn
of
seven
turned
faces
and
later
a
stump
of
a
with
a
white
ball
on
it
that
slashed
to
and
fro
at
the
waves
went
low
and
lower
and
down
thereafter
there
was
something
strange
in
his
voice
although
steady
it
was
deep
with
mourning
and
of
a
quality
beyond
oration
or
tears
keep
a
little
more
south
billie
said
he
little
more
south
sir
said
the
oiler
in
the
stern
a
seat
in
this
boat
was
not
unlike
a
seat
upon
a
bucking
broncho
and
by
the
same
token
a
broncho
is
not
much
smaller
the
craft
pranced
and
reared
and
plunged
like
an
animal
as
each
wave
came
and
she
rose
for
it
she
seemed
like
a
horse
making
at
a
fence
outrageously
high
the
manner
of
her
scramble
over
these
walls
of
water
is
a
mystic
thing
and
moreover
at
the
top
of
them
were
ordinarily
these
problems
in
white
water
the
foam
racing
down
from
the
summit
of
each
wave
requiring
a
new
leap
and
a
leap
from
the
air
then
after
scornfully
bumping
a
crest
she
would
slide
and
race
and
splash
down
a
long
incline
and
arrive
bobbing
and
nodding
in
front
of
the
next
menace
a
singular
disadvantage
of
the
sea
lies
in
the
fact
that
after
successfully
surmounting
one
wave
you
discover
that
there
is
another
behind
it
just
as
important
and
just
as
nervously
anxious
to
do
something
effective
in
the
way
of
swamping
boats
in
a
dingey
one
can
get
an
idea
of
the
resources
of
the
sea
in
the
line
of
waves
that
is
not
probable
to
the
average
experience
which
is
never
at
sea
in
a
dingey
as
each
slaty
wall
of
water
approached
it
shut
all
else
from
the
view
of
the
men
in
the
boat
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
this
particular
wave
was
the
final
outburst
of
the
ocean
the
last
effort
of
the
grim
water
there
was
a
terrible
grace
in
the
move
of
the
waves
and
they
came
in
silence
save
for
the
snarling
of
the
crests
in
the
wan
light
the
faces
of
the
men
must
have
been
grey
their
eyes
must
have
glinted
in
strange
ways
as
they
gazed
steadily
astern
viewed
from
a
balcony
the
whole
thing
would
doubtlessly
have
been
weirdly
picturesque
but
the
men
in
the
boat
had
no
time
to
see
it
and
if
they
had
had
leisure
there
were
other
things
to
occupy
their
minds
the
sun
swung
steadily
up
the
sky
and
they
knew
it
was
broad
day
because
the
colour
of
the
sea
changed
from
slate
to
streaked
with
amber
lights
and
the
foam
was
like
tumbling
snow
the
process
of
the
breaking
day
was
unknown
to
them
they
were
aware
only
of
this
effect
upon
the
colour
of
the
waves
that
rolled
toward
them
in
disjointed
sentences
the
cook
and
the
correspondent
argued
as
to
the
difference
between
a
station
and
a
house
of
refuge
the
cook
had
said
there
a
house
of
refuge
just
north
of
the
mosquito
inlet
light
and
as
soon
as
they
see
us
they
come
off
in
their
boat
and
pick
us
up
as
soon
as
who
see
us
said
the
correspondent
the
crew
said
the
cook
houses
of
refuge
do
have
crews
said
the
correspondent
as
i
understand
them
they
are
only
places
where
clothes
and
grub
are
stored
for
the
benefit
of
shipwrecked
people
they
do
carry
crews
oh
yes
they
do
said
the
cook
no
they
do
said
the
correspondent
well
we
not
there
yet
anyhow
said
the
oiler
in
the
stern
well
said
the
cook
perhaps
it
not
a
house
of
refuge
that
i
thinking
of
as
being
near
mosquito
inlet
light
perhaps
it
a
station
we
not
there
yet
said
the
oiler
in
the
stern
ii
as
the
boat
bounced
from
the
top
of
each
wave
the
wind
tore
through
the
hair
of
the
hatless
men
and
as
the
craft
plopped
her
stern
down
again
the
spray
slashed
past
them
the
crest
of
each
of
these
waves
was
a
hill
from
the
top
of
which
the
men
surveyed
for
a
moment
a
broad
tumultuous
expanse
shining
and
it
was
probably
splendid
it
was
probably
glorious
this
play
of
the
free
sea
wild
with
lights
of
emerald
and
white
and
amber
bully
good
thing
it
an
wind
said
the
cook
if
not
where
would
we
be
would
have
a
show
that
right
said
the
correspondent
the
busy
oiler
nodded
his
assent
then
the
captain
in
the
bow
chuckled
in
a
way
that
expressed
humour
contempt
tragedy
all
in
one
do
you
think
we
got
much
of
a
show
now
boys
said
he
whereupon
the
three
were
silent
save
for
a
trifle
of
hemming
and
hawing
to
express
any
particular
optimism
at
this
time
they
felt
to
be
childish
and
stupid
but
they
all
doubtless
possessed
this
sense
of
the
situation
in
their
mind
a
young
man
thinks
doggedly
at
such
times
on
the
other
hand
the
ethics
of
their
condition
was
decidedly
against
any
open
suggestion
of
hopelessness
so
they
were
silent
oh
well
said
the
captain
soothing
his
children
we
get
ashore
all
right
but
there
was
that
in
his
tone
which
made
them
think
so
the
oiler
quoth
yes
if
this
wind
holds
the
cook
was
bailing
yes
if
we
do
catch
hell
in
the
surf
canton
flannel
gulls
flew
near
and
far
sometimes
they
sat
down
on
the
sea
near
patches
of
brown
that
rolled
over
the
waves
with
a
movement
like
carpets
on
a
line
in
a
gale
the
birds
sat
comfortably
in
groups
and
they
were
envied
by
some
in
the
dingey
for
the
wrath
of
the
sea
was
no
more
to
them
than
it
was
to
a
covey
of
prairie
chickens
a
thousand
miles
inland
often
they
came
very
close
and
stared
at
the
men
with
black
eyes
at
these
times
they
were
uncanny
and
sinister
in
their
unblinking
scrutiny
and
the
men
hooted
angrily
at
them
telling
them
to
be
gone
one
came
and
evidently
decided
to
alight
on
the
top
of
the
captain
head
the
bird
flew
parallel
to
the
boat
and
did
not
circle
but
made
short
sidelong
jumps
in
the
air
in
his
black
eyes
were
wistfully
fixed
upon
the
captain
head
ugly
brute
said
the
oiler
to
the
bird
you
look
as
if
you
were
made
with
a
the
cook
and
the
correspondent
swore
darkly
at
the
creature
the
captain
naturally
wished
to
knock
it
away
with
the
end
of
the
heavy
painter
but
he
did
not
dare
do
it
because
anything
resembling
an
emphatic
gesture
would
have
capsized
this
freighted
boat
and
so
with
his
open
hand
the
captain
gently
and
carefully
waved
the
gull
away
after
it
had
been
discouraged
from
the
pursuit
the
captain
breathed
easier
on
account
of
his
hair
and
others
breathed
easier
because
the
bird
struck
their
minds
at
this
time
as
being
somehow
grewsome
and
ominous
in
the
meantime
the
oiler
and
the
correspondent
rowed
and
also
they
rowed
they
sat
together
in
the
same
seat
and
each
rowed
an
oar
then
the
oiler
took
both
oars
then
the
correspondent
took
both
oars
then
the
oiler
then
the
correspondent
they
rowed
and
they
rowed
the
very
ticklish
part
of
the
business
was
when
the
time
came
for
the
reclining
one
in
the
stern
to
take
his
turn
at
the
oars
by
the
very
last
star
of
truth
it
is
easier
to
steal
eggs
from
under
a
hen
than
it
was
to
change
seats
in
the
dingey
first
the
man
in
the
stern
slid
his
hand
along
the
thwart
and
moved
with
care
as
if
he
were
of
s√®vres
then
the
man
in
the
rowing
seat
slid
his
hand
along
the
other
thwart
it
was
all
done
with
the
most
extraordinary
care
as
the
two
sidled
past
each
other
the
whole
party
kept
watchful
eyes
on
the
coming
wave
and
the
captain
cried
look
out
now
steady
there
the
brown
mats
of
that
appeared
from
time
to
time
were
like
islands
bits
of
earth
they
were
travelling
apparently
neither
one
way
nor
the
other
they
were
to
all
intents
stationary
they
informed
the
men
in
the
boat
that
it
was
making
progress
slowly
toward
the
land
the
captain
rearing
cautiously
in
the
bow
after
the
dingey
soared
on
a
great
swell
said
that
he
had
seen
the
lighthouse
at
mosquito
inlet
presently
the
cook
remarked
that
he
had
seen
it
the
correspondent
was
at
the
oars
then
and
for
some
reason
he
too
wished
to
look
at
the
lighthouse
but
his
back
was
toward
the
far
shore
and
the
waves
were
important
and
for
some
time
he
could
not
seize
an
opportunity
to
turn
his
head
but
at
last
there
came
a
wave
more
gentle
than
the
others
and
when
at
the
crest
of
it
he
swiftly
scoured
the
western
horizon
see
it
said
the
captain
no
said
the
correspondent
slowly
i
did
see
anything
look
again
said
the
captain
he
pointed
it
exactly
in
that
direction
at
the
top
of
another
wave
the
correspondent
did
as
he
was
bid
and
this
time
his
eyes
chanced
on
a
small
still
thing
on
the
edge
of
the
swaying
horizon
it
was
precisely
like
the
point
of
a
pin
it
took
an
anxious
eye
to
find
a
lighthouse
so
tiny
think
we
make
it
captain
if
this
wind
holds
and
the
boat
do
swamp
we
ca
do
much
else
said
the
captain
the
little
boat
lifted
by
each
towering
sea
and
splashed
viciously
by
the
crests
made
progress
that
in
the
absence
of
was
not
apparent
to
those
in
her
she
seemed
just
a
wee
thing
wallowing
miraculously
at
the
mercy
of
five
oceans
occasionally
a
great
spread
of
water
like
white
flames
swarmed
into
her
bail
her
cook
said
the
captain
serenely
all
right
captain
said
the
cheerful
cook
iii
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
subtle
brotherhood
of
men
that
was
here
established
on
the
seas
no
one
said
that
it
was
so
no
one
mentioned
it
but
it
dwelt
in
the
boat
and
each
man
felt
it
warm
him
they
were
a
captain
an
oiler
a
cook
and
a
correspondent
and
they
were
friends
friends
in
a
more
curiously
degree
than
may
be
common
the
hurt
captain
lying
against
the
in
the
bow
spoke
always
in
a
low
voice
and
calmly
but
he
could
never
command
a
more
ready
and
swiftly
obedient
crew
than
the
motley
three
of
the
dingey
it
was
more
than
a
mere
recognition
of
what
was
best
for
the
common
safety
there
was
surely
in
it
a
quality
that
was
personal
and
heartfelt
and
after
this
devotion
to
the
commander
of
the
boat
there
was
this
comradeship
that
the
correspondent
for
instance
who
had
been
taught
to
be
cynical
of
men
knew
even
at
the
time
was
the
best
experience
of
his
life
but
no
one
said
that
it
was
so
no
one
mentioned
it
i
wish
we
had
a
sail
remarked
the
captain
we
might
try
my
overcoat
on
the
end
of
an
oar
and
give
you
two
boys
a
chance
to
rest
so
the
cook
and
the
correspondent
held
the
mast
and
spread
wide
the
overcoat
the
oiler
steered
and
the
little
boat
made
good
way
with
her
new
rig
sometimes
the
oiler
had
to
scull
sharply
to
keep
a
sea
from
breaking
into
the
boat
but
otherwise
sailing
was
a
success
meanwhile
the
lighthouse
had
been
growing
slowly
larger
it
had
now
almost
assumed
colour
and
appeared
like
a
little
grey
shadow
on
the
sky
the
man
at
the
oars
could
not
be
prevented
from
turning
his
head
rather
often
to
try
for
a
glimpse
of
this
little
grey
shadow
at
last
from
the
top
of
each
wave
the
men
in
the
tossing
boat
could
see
land
even
as
the
lighthouse
was
an
upright
shadow
on
the
sky
this
land
seemed
but
a
long
black
shadow
on
the
sea
it
certainly
was
thinner
than
paper
we
must
be
about
opposite
new
smyrna
said
the
cook
who
had
coasted
this
shore
often
in
schooners
captain
by
the
way
i
believe
they
abandoned
that
station
there
about
a
year
ago
did
they
said
the
captain
the
wind
slowly
died
away
the
cook
and
the
correspondent
were
not
now
obliged
to
slave
in
order
to
hold
high
the
oar
but
the
waves
continued
their
old
impetuous
swooping
at
the
dingey
and
the
little
craft
no
longer
under
way
struggled
woundily
over
them
the
oiler
or
the
correspondent
took
the
oars
again
shipwrecks
are
of
nothing
if
men
could
only
train
for
them
and
have
them
occur
when
the
men
had
reached
pink
condition
there
would
be
less
drowning
at
sea
of
the
four
in
the
dingey
none
had
slept
any
time
worth
mentioning
for
two
days
and
two
nights
previous
to
embarking
in
the
dingey
and
in
the
excitement
of
clambering
about
the
deck
of
a
foundering
ship
they
had
also
forgotten
to
eat
heartily
for
these
reasons
and
for
others
neither
the
oiler
nor
the
correspondent
was
fond
of
rowing
at
this
time
the
correspondent
wondered
ingenuously
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
sane
could
there
be
people
who
thought
it
amusing
to
row
a
boat
it
was
not
an
amusement
it
was
a
diabolical
punishment
and
even
a
genius
of
mental
aberrations
could
never
conclude
that
it
was
anything
but
a
horror
to
the
muscles
and
a
crime
against
the
back
he
mentioned
to
the
boat
in
general
how
the
amusement
of
rowing
struck
him
and
the
oiler
smiled
in
full
sympathy
previously
to
the
foundering
by
the
way
the
oiler
had
worked
in
the
of
the
ship
take
her
easy
now
boys
said
the
captain
do
spend
yourselves
if
we
have
to
run
a
surf
you
need
all
your
strength
because
sure
have
to
swim
for
it
take
your
time
slowly
the
land
arose
from
the
sea
from
a
black
line
it
became
a
line
of
black
and
a
line
of
white
trees
and
sand
finally
the
captain
said
that
he
could
make
out
a
house
on
the
shore
that
the
house
of
refuge
sure
said
the
cook
they
see
us
before
long
and
come
out
after
us
the
distant
lighthouse
reared
high
the
keeper
ought
to
be
able
to
make
us
out
now
if
he
looking
through
a
glass
said
the
captain
he
notify
the
people
none
of
those
other
boats
could
have
got
ashore
to
give
word
of
the
wreck
said
the
oiler
in
a
low
voice
else
the
would
be
out
hunting
us
slowly
and
beautifully
the
land
loomed
out
of
the
sea
the
wind
came
again
it
had
veered
from
the
to
the
finally
a
new
sound
struck
the
ears
of
the
men
in
the
boat
it
was
the
low
thunder
of
the
surf
on
the
shore
we
never
be
able
to
make
the
lighthouse
now
said
the
captain
swing
her
head
a
little
more
north
billie
said
he
little
more
north
sir
said
the
oiler
whereupon
the
little
boat
turned
her
nose
once
more
down
the
wind
and
all
but
the
oarsman
watched
the
shore
grow
under
the
influence
of
this
expansion
doubt
and
direful
apprehension
was
leaving
the
minds
of
the
men
the
management
of
the
boat
was
still
most
absorbing
but
it
could
not
prevent
a
quiet
cheerfulness
in
an
hour
perhaps
they
would
be
ashore
their
backbones
had
become
thoroughly
used
to
balancing
in
the
boat
and
they
now
rode
this
wild
colt
of
a
dingey
like
circus
men
the
correspondent
thought
that
he
had
been
drenched
to
the
skin
but
happening
to
feel
in
the
top
pocket
of
his
coat
he
found
therein
eight
cigars
four
of
them
were
soaked
with
four
were
perfectly
scatheless
after
a
search
somebody
produced
three
dry
matches
and
thereupon
the
four
waifs
rode
impudently
in
their
little
boat
and
with
an
assurance
of
an
impending
rescue
shining
in
their
eyes
puffed
at
the
big
cigars
and
judged
well
and
ill
of
all
men
everybody
took
a
drink
of
water
iv
cook
remarked
the
captain
there
do
seem
to
be
any
signs
of
life
about
your
house
of
refuge
no
replied
the
cook
funny
they
do
see
us
a
broad
stretch
of
lowly
coast
lay
before
the
eyes
of
the
men
it
was
of
dunes
topped
with
dark
vegetation
the
roar
of
the
surf
was
plain
and
sometimes
they
could
see
the
white
lip
of
a
wave
as
it
spun
up
the
beach
a
tiny
house
was
blocked
out
black
upon
the
sky
southward
the
slim
lighthouse
lifted
its
little
grey
length
tide
wind
and
waves
were
swinging
the
dingey
northward
funny
they
do
see
us
said
the
men
the
surf
roar
was
here
dulled
but
its
tone
was
nevertheless
thunderous
and
mighty
as
the
boat
swam
over
the
great
rollers
the
men
sat
listening
to
this
roar
we
swamp
sure
said
everybody
it
is
fair
to
say
here
that
there
was
not
a
station
within
twenty
miles
in
either
direction
but
the
men
did
not
know
this
fact
and
in
consequence
they
made
dark
and
opprobrious
remarks
concerning
the
eyesight
of
the
nation
four
scowling
men
sat
in
the
dingey
and
surpassed
records
in
the
invention
of
epithets
funny
they
do
see
us
the
of
a
former
time
had
completely
faded
to
their
sharpened
minds
it
was
easy
to
conjure
pictures
of
all
kinds
of
incompetency
and
blindness
and
indeed
cowardice
there
was
the
shore
of
the
populous
land
and
it
was
bitter
and
bitter
to
them
that
from
it
came
no
sign
well
said
the
captain
ultimately
i
suppose
we
have
to
make
a
try
for
ourselves
if
we
stay
out
here
too
long
we
none
of
us
have
strength
left
to
swim
after
the
boat
swamps
and
so
the
oiler
who
was
at
the
oars
turned
the
boat
straight
for
the
shore
there
was
a
sudden
tightening
of
muscles
there
was
some
thinking
if
we
do
all
get
ashore
said
the
captain
if
we
do
all
get
ashore
i
suppose
you
fellows
know
where
to
send
news
of
my
finish
they
then
briefly
exchanged
some
addresses
and
admonitions
as
for
the
reflections
of
the
men
there
was
a
great
deal
of
rage
in
them
perchance
they
might
be
formulated
thus
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
why
in
the
name
of
the
seven
mad
gods
who
rule
the
sea
was
i
allowed
to
come
thus
far
and
contemplate
sand
and
trees
was
i
brought
here
merely
to
have
my
nose
dragged
away
as
i
was
about
to
nibble
the
sacred
cheese
of
life
it
is
preposterous
if
this
old
fate
can
not
do
better
than
this
she
should
be
deprived
of
the
management
of
fortunes
she
is
an
old
hen
who
knows
not
her
intention
if
she
has
decided
to
drown
me
why
did
she
not
do
it
in
the
beginning
and
save
me
all
this
trouble
the
whole
affair
is
absurd
but
no
she
can
not
mean
to
drown
me
she
dare
not
drown
me
she
can
not
drown
me
not
after
all
this
work
afterward
the
man
might
have
had
an
impulse
to
shake
his
fist
at
the
clouds
just
you
drown
me
now
and
then
hear
what
i
call
you
the
billows
that
came
at
this
time
were
more
formidable
they
seemed
always
just
about
to
break
and
roll
over
the
little
boat
in
a
turmoil
of
foam
there
was
a
preparatory
and
long
growl
in
the
speech
of
them
no
mind
unused
to
the
sea
would
have
concluded
that
the
dingey
could
ascend
these
sheer
heights
in
time
the
shore
was
still
afar
the
oiler
was
a
wily
surfman
boys
he
said
swiftly
she
wo
live
three
minutes
more
and
we
too
far
out
to
swim
shall
i
take
her
to
sea
again
captain
yes
go
ahead
said
the
captain
this
oiler
by
a
series
of
quick
miracles
and
fast
and
steady
oarsmanship
turned
the
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
surf
and
took
her
safely
to
sea
again
there
was
a
considerable
silence
as
the
boat
bumped
over
the
furrowed
sea
to
deeper
water
then
somebody
in
gloom
spoke
well
anyhow
they
must
have
seen
us
from
the
shore
by
now
the
gulls
went
in
slanting
flight
up
the
wind
toward
the
grey
desolate
east
a
squall
marked
by
dingy
clouds
and
clouds
like
smoke
from
a
burning
building
appeared
from
the
what
do
you
think
of
those
people
ai
they
peaches
funny
they
have
seen
us
maybe
they
think
we
out
here
for
sport
maybe
they
think
fishin
maybe
they
think
we
damned
fools
it
was
a
long
afternoon
a
changed
tide
tried
to
force
them
southward
but
wind
and
wave
said
northward
far
ahead
where
sea
and
sky
formed
their
mighty
angle
there
were
little
dots
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
city
on
the
shore
st
augustine
the
captain
shook
his
head
too
near
mosquito
inlet
and
the
oiler
rowed
and
then
the
correspondent
rowed
then
the
oiler
rowed
it
was
a
weary
business
the
human
back
can
become
the
seat
of
more
aches
and
pains
than
are
registered
in
books
for
the
composite
anatomy
of
a
regiment
it
is
a
limited
area
but
it
can
become
the
theatre
of
innumerable
muscular
conflicts
tangles
wrenches
knots
and
other
comforts
did
you
ever
like
to
row
billie
asked
the
correspondent
no
said
the
oiler
hang
it
when
one
exchanged
the
for
a
place
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
suffered
a
bodily
depression
that
caused
him
to
be
careless
of
everything
save
an
obligation
to
wiggle
one
finger
there
was
cold
swashing
to
and
fro
in
the
boat
and
he
lay
in
it
his
head
pillowed
on
a
thwart
was
within
an
inch
of
the
swirl
of
a
wave
crest
and
sometimes
a
particularly
obstreperous
sea
came
and
drenched
him
once
more
but
these
matters
did
not
annoy
him
it
is
almost
certain
that
if
the
boat
had
capsized
he
would
have
tumbled
comfortably
out
upon
the
ocean
as
if
he
felt
sure
that
it
was
a
great
soft
mattress
look
there
a
man
on
the
shore
where
there
see
see
yes
sure
he
walking
along
now
he
stopped
look
he
facing
us
he
waving
at
us
so
he
is
by
thunder
ah
now
we
all
right
now
we
all
right
there
be
a
boat
out
here
for
us
in
he
going
on
he
running
he
going
up
to
that
house
there
the
remote
beach
seemed
lower
than
the
sea
and
it
required
a
searching
glance
to
discern
the
little
black
figure
the
captain
saw
a
floating
stick
and
they
rowed
to
it
a
was
by
some
weird
chance
in
the
boat
and
tying
this
on
the
stick
the
captain
waved
it
the
oarsman
did
not
dare
turn
his
head
so
he
was
obliged
to
ask
questions
what
he
doing
now
he
standing
still
again
he
looking
i
think
there
he
goes
again
towards
the
house
now
he
stopped
again
is
he
waving
at
us
no
not
now
he
was
though
look
there
comes
another
man
he
running
look
at
him
go
would
you
why
he
on
a
bicycle
now
he
met
the
other
man
they
both
waving
at
us
look
there
comes
something
up
the
beach
what
the
devil
is
that
thing
why
it
looks
like
a
boat
why
certainly
it
a
boat
no
it
on
wheels
yes
so
it
is
well
that
must
be
the
they
drag
them
along
shore
on
a
wagon
that
the
sure
no
by
it
it
an
omnibus
i
tell
you
it
a
it
is
not
it
an
omnibus
i
can
see
it
plain
see
one
of
these
big
hotel
omnibuses
by
thunder
you
right
it
an
omnibus
sure
as
fate
what
do
you
suppose
they
are
doing
with
an
omnibus
maybe
they
are
going
around
collecting
the
hey
that
it
likely
look
there
a
fellow
waving
a
little
black
flag
he
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
omnibus
there
come
those
other
two
fellows
now
they
all
talking
together
look
at
the
fellow
with
the
flag
maybe
he
ai
waving
it
that
ai
a
flag
is
it
that
his
coat
why
certainly
that
his
coat
so
it
is
it
his
coat
he
taken
it
off
and
is
waving
it
around
his
head
but
would
you
look
at
him
swing
it
oh
say
there
is
any
station
there
that
just
a
winter
resort
hotel
omnibus
that
has
brought
over
some
of
the
boarders
to
see
us
drown
what
that
idiot
with
the
coat
mean
what
he
signaling
anyhow
it
looks
as
if
he
were
trying
to
tell
us
to
go
north
there
must
be
a
station
up
there
no
he
thinks
we
fishing
just
giving
us
a
merry
hand
see
ah
there
willie
well
i
wish
i
could
make
something
out
of
those
signals
what
do
you
suppose
he
means
he
do
mean
anything
he
just
playing
well
if
he
just
signal
us
to
try
the
surf
again
or
to
go
to
sea
and
wait
or
go
north
or
go
south
or
go
to
hell
there
would
be
some
reason
in
it
but
look
at
him
he
just
stands
there
and
keeps
his
coat
revolving
like
a
wheel
the
ass
there
come
more
people
now
there
quite
a
mob
look
is
that
a
boat
where
oh
i
see
where
you
mean
no
that
no
boat
that
fellow
is
still
waving
his
coat
he
must
think
we
like
to
see
him
do
that
why
do
he
quit
it
it
do
mean
anything
i
do
know
i
think
he
is
trying
to
make
us
go
north
it
must
be
that
there
a
station
there
somewhere
say
he
ai
tired
yet
look
at
wave
wonder
how
long
he
can
keep
that
up
he
been
revolving
his
coat
ever
since
he
caught
sight
of
us
he
an
idiot
why
are
they
getting
men
to
bring
a
boat
out
a
fishing
boat
one
of
those
big
yawls
could
come
out
here
all
right
why
do
he
do
something
oh
it
all
right
now
they
have
a
boat
out
here
for
us
in
less
than
no
time
now
that
they
seen
us
a
faint
yellow
tone
came
into
the
sky
over
the
low
land
the
shadows
on
the
sea
slowly
deepened
the
wind
bore
coldness
with
it
and
the
men
began
to
shiver
holy
smoke
said
one
allowing
his
voice
to
express
his
impious
mood
if
we
keep
on
monkeying
out
here
if
we
got
to
flounder
out
here
all
night
oh
we
never
have
to
stay
here
all
night
do
you
worry
seen
us
now
and
it
wo
be
long
before
they
come
chasing
out
after
us
the
shore
grew
dusky
the
man
waving
a
coat
blended
gradually
into
this
gloom
and
it
swallowed
in
the
same
manner
the
omnibus
and
the
group
of
people
the
spray
when
it
dashed
uproariously
over
the
side
made
the
voyagers
shrink
and
swear
like
men
who
were
being
branded
i
like
to
catch
the
chump
who
waved
the
coat
i
feel
like
soaking
him
one
just
for
luck
why
what
did
he
do
oh
nothing
but
then
he
seemed
so
damned
cheerful
in
the
meantime
the
oiler
rowed
and
then
the
correspondent
rowed
and
then
the
oiler
rowed
and
bowed
forward
they
mechanically
turn
by
turn
plied
the
leaden
oars
the
form
of
the
lighthouse
had
vanished
from
the
southern
horizon
but
finally
a
pale
star
appeared
just
lifting
from
the
sea
the
streaked
saffron
in
the
west
passed
before
the
darkness
and
the
sea
to
the
east
was
black
the
land
had
vanished
and
was
expressed
only
by
the
low
and
drear
thunder
of
the
surf
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
why
in
the
name
of
the
seven
mad
gods
who
rule
the
sea
was
i
allowed
to
come
thus
far
and
contemplate
sand
and
trees
was
i
brought
here
merely
to
have
my
nose
dragged
away
as
i
was
about
to
nibble
the
sacred
cheese
of
life
the
patient
captain
drooped
over
the
was
sometimes
obliged
to
speak
to
the
oarsman
keep
her
head
up
keep
her
head
up
her
head
up
sir
the
voices
were
weary
and
low
this
was
surely
a
quiet
evening
all
save
the
oarsman
lay
heavily
and
listlessly
in
the
boat
bottom
as
for
him
his
eyes
were
just
capable
of
noting
the
tall
black
waves
that
swept
forward
in
a
most
sinister
silence
save
for
an
occasional
subdued
growl
of
a
crest
the
cook
head
was
on
a
thwart
and
he
looked
without
interest
at
the
water
under
his
nose
he
was
deep
in
other
scenes
finally
he
spoke
billie
he
murmured
dreamfully
what
kind
of
pie
do
you
like
best
v
pie
said
the
oiler
and
the
correspondent
agitatedly
do
talk
about
those
things
blast
you
well
said
the
cook
i
was
just
thinking
about
ham
sandwiches
and
a
night
on
the
sea
in
an
open
boat
is
a
long
night
as
darkness
settled
finally
the
shine
of
the
light
lifting
from
the
sea
in
the
south
changed
to
full
gold
on
the
northern
horizon
a
new
light
appeared
a
small
bluish
gleam
on
the
edge
of
the
waters
these
two
lights
were
the
furniture
of
the
world
otherwise
there
was
nothing
but
waves
two
men
huddled
in
the
stern
and
distances
were
so
magnificent
in
the
dingey
that
the
rower
was
enabled
to
keep
his
feet
partly
warmed
by
thrusting
them
under
his
companions
their
legs
indeed
extended
far
under
the
until
they
touched
the
feet
of
the
captain
forward
sometimes
despite
the
efforts
of
the
tired
oarsman
a
wave
came
piling
into
the
boat
an
icy
wave
of
the
night
and
the
chilling
water
soaked
them
anew
they
would
twist
their
bodies
for
a
moment
and
groan
and
sleep
the
dead
sleep
once
more
while
the
water
in
the
boat
gurgled
about
them
as
the
craft
rocked
the
plan
of
the
oiler
and
the
correspondent
was
for
one
to
row
until
he
lost
the
ability
and
then
arouse
the
other
from
his
couch
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
oiler
plied
the
oars
until
his
head
drooped
forward
and
the
overpowering
sleep
blinded
him
and
he
rowed
yet
afterward
then
he
touched
a
man
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
called
his
name
will
you
spell
me
for
a
little
while
he
said
meekly
sure
billie
said
the
correspondent
awakening
and
dragging
himself
to
a
sitting
position
they
exchanged
places
carefully
and
the
oiler
cuddling
down
in
the
at
the
cook
side
seemed
to
go
to
sleep
instantly
the
particular
violence
of
the
sea
had
ceased
the
waves
came
without
snarling
the
obligation
of
the
man
at
the
oars
was
to
keep
the
boat
headed
so
that
the
tilt
of
the
rollers
would
not
capsize
her
and
to
preserve
her
from
filling
when
the
crests
rushed
past
the
black
waves
were
silent
and
hard
to
be
seen
in
the
darkness
often
one
was
almost
upon
the
boat
before
the
oarsman
was
aware
in
a
low
voice
the
correspondent
addressed
the
captain
he
was
not
sure
that
the
captain
was
awake
although
this
iron
man
seemed
to
be
always
awake
captain
shall
i
keep
her
making
for
that
light
north
sir
the
same
steady
voice
answered
him
yes
keep
it
about
two
points
off
the
port
bow
the
cook
had
tied
a
around
himself
in
order
to
get
even
the
warmth
which
this
clumsy
cork
contrivance
could
donate
and
he
seemed
almost
when
a
rower
whose
teeth
invariably
chattered
wildly
as
soon
as
he
ceased
his
labour
dropped
down
to
sleep
the
correspondent
as
he
rowed
looked
down
at
the
two
men
sleeping
the
cook
arm
was
around
the
oiler
shoulders
and
with
their
fragmentary
clothing
and
haggard
faces
they
were
the
babes
of
the
sea
a
grotesque
rendering
of
the
old
babes
in
the
wood
later
he
must
have
grown
stupid
at
his
work
for
suddenly
there
was
a
growling
of
water
and
a
crest
came
with
a
roar
and
a
swash
into
the
boat
and
it
was
a
wonder
that
it
did
not
set
the
cook
afloat
in
his
the
cook
continued
to
sleep
but
the
oiler
sat
up
blinking
his
eyes
and
shaking
with
the
new
cold
oh
i
awful
sorry
billie
said
the
correspondent
contritely
that
all
right
old
boy
said
the
oiler
and
lay
down
again
and
was
asleep
presently
it
seemed
that
even
the
captain
dozed
and
the
correspondent
thought
that
he
was
the
one
man
afloat
on
all
the
oceans
the
wind
had
a
voice
as
it
came
over
the
waves
and
it
was
sadder
than
the
end
there
was
a
long
loud
swishing
astern
of
the
boat
and
a
gleaming
trail
of
phosphorescence
like
blue
flame
was
furrowed
on
the
black
waters
it
might
have
been
made
by
a
monstrous
knife
then
there
came
a
stillness
while
the
correspondent
breathed
with
the
open
mouth
and
looked
at
the
sea
suddenly
there
was
another
swish
and
another
long
flash
of
bluish
light
and
this
time
it
was
alongside
the
boat
and
might
almost
have
been
reached
with
an
oar
the
correspondent
saw
an
enormous
fin
speed
like
a
shadow
through
the
water
hurling
the
crystalline
spray
and
leaving
the
long
glowing
trail
the
correspondent
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
captain
his
face
was
hidden
and
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
he
looked
at
the
babes
of
the
sea
they
certainly
were
asleep
so
being
bereft
of
sympathy
he
leaned
a
little
way
to
one
side
and
swore
softly
into
the
sea
but
the
thing
did
not
then
leave
the
vicinity
of
the
boat
ahead
or
astern
on
one
side
or
the
other
at
intervals
long
or
short
fled
the
long
sparkling
streak
and
there
was
to
be
heard
the
whiroo
of
the
dark
fin
the
speed
and
power
of
the
thing
was
greatly
to
be
admired
it
cut
the
water
like
a
gigantic
and
keen
projectile
the
presence
of
this
biding
thing
did
not
affect
the
man
with
the
same
horror
that
it
would
if
he
had
been
a
picnicker
he
simply
looked
at
the
sea
dully
and
swore
in
an
undertone
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
alone
he
wished
one
of
his
companions
to
awaken
by
chance
and
keep
him
company
with
it
but
the
captain
hung
motionless
over
the
and
the
oiler
and
the
cook
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
were
plunged
in
slumber
vi
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
if
i
am
going
to
be
drowned
why
in
the
name
of
the
seven
mad
gods
who
rule
the
sea
was
i
allowed
to
come
thus
far
and
contemplate
sand
and
trees
during
this
dismal
night
it
may
be
remarked
that
a
man
would
conclude
that
it
was
really
the
intention
of
the
seven
mad
gods
to
drown
him
despite
the
abominable
injustice
of
it
for
it
was
certainly
an
abominable
injustice
to
drown
a
man
who
had
worked
so
hard
so
hard
the
man
felt
it
would
be
a
crime
most
unnatural
other
people
had
drowned
at
sea
since
galleys
swarmed
with
painted
sails
but
still
when
it
occurs
to
a
man
that
nature
does
not
regard
him
as
important
and
that
she
feels
she
would
not
maim
the
universe
by
disposing
of
him
he
at
first
wishes
to
throw
bricks
at
the
temple
and
he
hates
deeply
the
fact
that
there
are
no
bricks
and
no
temples
any
visible
expression
of
nature
would
surely
be
pelleted
with
his
jeers
then
if
there
be
no
tangible
thing
to
hoot
he
feels
perhaps
the
desire
to
confront
a
personification
and
indulge
in
pleas
bowed
to
one
knee
and
with
hands
supplicant
saying
yes
but
i
love
myself
a
high
cold
star
on
a
winter
night
is
the
word
he
feels
that
she
says
to
him
thereafter
he
knows
the
pathos
of
his
situation
the
men
in
the
dingey
had
not
discussed
these
matters
but
each
had
no
doubt
reflected
upon
them
in
silence
and
according
to
his
mind
there
was
seldom
any
expression
upon
their
faces
save
the
general
one
of
complete
weariness
speech
was
devoted
to
the
business
of
the
boat
to
chime
the
notes
of
his
emotion
a
verse
mysteriously
entered
the
correspondent
head
he
had
even
forgotten
that
he
had
forgotten
this
verse
but
it
suddenly
was
in
his
mind
a
soldier
of
the
legion
lay
dying
in
algiers
there
was
lack
of
woman
nursing
there
was
dearth
of
woman
tears
but
a
comrade
stood
beside
him
and
he
took
that
comrade
hand
and
he
said
shall
never
see
my
own
my
native
land
in
his
childhood
the
correspondent
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
a
soldier
of
the
legion
lay
dying
in
algiers
but
he
had
never
regarded
the
fact
as
important
myriads
of
his
had
informed
him
of
the
soldier
plight
but
the
dinning
had
naturally
ended
by
making
him
perfectly
indifferent
he
had
never
considered
it
his
affair
that
a
soldier
of
the
legion
lay
dying
in
algiers
nor
had
it
appeared
to
him
as
a
matter
for
sorrow
it
was
less
to
him
than
the
breaking
of
a
pencil
point
now
however
it
quaintly
came
to
him
as
a
human
living
thing
it
was
no
longer
merely
a
picture
of
a
few
throes
in
the
breast
of
a
poet
meanwhile
drinking
tea
and
warming
his
feet
at
the
grate
it
was
an
actuality
stern
mournful
and
fine
the
correspondent
plainly
saw
the
soldier
he
lay
on
the
sand
with
his
feet
out
straight
and
still
while
his
pale
left
hand
was
upon
his
chest
in
an
attempt
to
thwart
the
going
of
his
life
the
blood
came
between
his
fingers
in
the
far
algerian
distance
a
city
of
low
square
forms
was
set
against
a
sky
that
was
faint
with
the
last
sunset
hues
the
correspondent
plying
the
oars
and
dreaming
of
the
slow
and
slower
movements
of
the
lips
of
the
soldier
was
moved
by
a
profound
and
perfectly
impersonal
comprehension
he
was
sorry
for
the
soldier
of
the
legion
who
lay
dying
in
algiers
the
thing
which
had
followed
the
boat
and
waited
had
evidently
grown
bored
at
the
delay
there
was
no
longer
to
be
heard
the
slash
of
the
and
there
was
no
longer
the
flame
of
the
long
trail
the
light
in
the
north
still
glimmered
but
it
was
apparently
no
nearer
to
the
boat
sometimes
the
boom
of
the
surf
rang
in
the
ears
and
he
turned
the
craft
seaward
then
and
rowed
harder
southward
some
one
had
evidently
built
a
on
the
beach
it
was
too
low
and
too
far
to
be
seen
but
it
made
a
shimmering
roseate
reflection
upon
the
bluff
back
of
it
and
this
could
be
discerned
from
the
boat
the
wind
came
stronger
and
sometimes
a
wave
suddenly
raged
out
like
a
and
there
was
to
be
seen
the
sheen
and
sparkle
of
a
broken
crest
the
captain
in
the
bow
moved
on
his
and
sat
erect
pretty
long
night
he
observed
to
the
correspondent
he
looked
at
the
shore
those
people
take
their
time
did
you
see
that
shark
playing
around
yes
i
saw
him
he
was
a
big
fellow
all
right
wish
i
had
known
you
were
awake
later
the
correspondent
spoke
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
billie
there
was
a
slow
and
gradual
disentanglement
billie
will
you
spell
me
sure
said
the
oiler
as
soon
as
the
correspondent
touched
the
cold
comfortable
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
had
huddled
close
to
the
cook
he
was
deep
in
sleep
despite
the
fact
that
his
teeth
played
all
the
popular
airs
this
sleep
was
so
good
to
him
that
it
was
but
a
moment
before
he
heard
a
voice
call
his
name
in
a
tone
that
demonstrated
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
will
you
spell
me
sure
billie
the
light
in
the
north
had
mysteriously
vanished
but
the
correspondent
took
his
course
from
the
captain
later
in
the
night
they
took
the
boat
farther
out
to
sea
and
the
captain
directed
the
cook
to
take
one
oar
at
the
stern
and
keep
the
boat
facing
the
seas
he
was
to
call
out
if
he
should
hear
the
thunder
of
the
surf
this
plan
enabled
the
oiler
and
the
correspondent
to
get
respite
together
we
give
those
boys
a
chance
to
get
into
shape
again
said
the
captain
they
curled
down
and
after
a
few
preliminary
chatterings
and
trembles
slept
once
more
the
dead
sleep
neither
knew
they
had
bequeathed
to
the
cook
the
company
of
another
shark
or
perhaps
the
same
shark
as
the
boat
caroused
on
the
waves
spray
occasionally
bumped
over
the
side
and
gave
them
a
fresh
soaking
but
this
had
no
power
to
break
their
repose
the
ominous
slash
of
the
wind
and
the
water
affected
them
as
it
would
have
affected
mummies
boys
said
the
cook
with
the
notes
of
every
reluctance
in
his
voice
she
drifted
in
pretty
close
i
guess
one
of
you
had
better
take
her
to
sea
again
the
correspondent
aroused
heard
the
crash
of
the
toppled
crests
as
he
was
rowing
the
captain
gave
him
some
and
this
steadied
the
chills
out
of
him
if
i
ever
get
ashore
and
anybody
shows
me
even
a
photograph
of
an
oar
at
last
there
was
a
short
conversation
billie
billie
will
you
spell
me
sure
said
the
oiler
vii
when
the
correspondent
again
opened
his
eyes
the
sea
and
the
sky
were
each
of
the
grey
hue
of
the
dawning
later
carmine
and
gold
was
painted
upon
the
waters
the
morning
appeared
finally
in
its
splendour
with
a
sky
of
pure
blue
and
the
sunlight
flamed
on
the
tips
of
the
waves
on
the
distant
dunes
were
set
many
little
black
cottages
and
a
tall
white
windmill
reared
above
them
no
man
nor
dog
nor
bicycle
appeared
on
the
beach
the
cottages
might
have
formed
a
deserted
village
the
voyagers
scanned
the
shore
a
conference
was
held
in
the
boat
well
said
the
captain
if
no
help
is
coming
we
might
better
try
a
run
through
the
surf
right
away
if
we
stay
out
here
much
longer
we
will
be
too
weak
to
do
anything
for
ourselves
at
all
the
others
silently
acquiesced
in
this
reasoning
the
boat
was
headed
for
the
beach
the
correspondent
wondered
if
none
ever
ascended
the
tall
and
if
then
they
never
looked
seaward
this
tower
was
a
giant
standing
with
its
back
to
the
plight
of
the
ants
it
represented
in
a
degree
to
the
correspondent
the
serenity
of
nature
amid
the
struggles
of
the
individual
nature
in
the
wind
and
nature
in
the
vision
of
men
she
did
not
seem
cruel
to
him
then
nor
beneficent
nor
treacherous
nor
wise
but
she
was
indifferent
flatly
indifferent
it
is
perhaps
plausible
that
a
man
in
this
situation
impressed
with
the
unconcern
of
the
universe
should
see
the
innumerable
flaws
of
his
life
and
have
them
taste
wickedly
in
his
mind
and
wish
for
another
chance
a
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
seems
absurdly
clear
to
him
then
in
this
new
ignorance
of
the
and
he
understands
that
if
he
were
given
another
opportunity
he
would
mend
his
conduct
and
his
words
and
be
better
and
brighter
during
an
introduction
or
at
a
tea
now
boys
said
the
captain
she
is
going
to
swamp
sure
all
we
can
do
is
to
work
her
in
as
far
as
possible
and
then
when
she
swamps
pile
out
and
scramble
for
the
beach
keep
cool
now
and
do
jump
until
she
swamps
sure
the
oiler
took
the
oars
over
his
shoulders
he
scanned
the
surf
captain
he
said
i
think
i
better
bring
her
about
and
keep
her
to
the
seas
and
back
her
in
all
right
billie
said
the
captain
back
her
in
the
oiler
swung
the
boat
then
and
seated
in
the
stern
the
cook
and
the
correspondent
were
obliged
to
look
over
their
shoulders
to
contemplate
the
lonely
and
indifferent
shore
the
monstrous
rollers
heaved
the
boat
high
until
the
men
were
again
enabled
to
see
the
white
sheets
of
water
scudding
up
the
slanted
beach
we
wo
get
in
very
close
said
the
captain
each
time
a
man
could
wrest
his
attention
from
the
rollers
he
turned
his
glance
toward
the
shore
and
in
the
expression
of
the
eyes
during
this
contemplation
there
was
a
singular
quality
the
correspondent
observing
the
others
knew
that
they
were
not
afraid
but
the
full
meaning
of
their
glances
was
shrouded
as
for
himself
he
was
too
tired
to
grapple
fundamentally
with
the
fact
he
tried
to
coerce
his
mind
into
thinking
of
it
but
the
mind
was
dominated
at
this
time
by
the
muscles
and
the
muscles
said
they
did
not
care
it
merely
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
should
drown
it
would
be
a
shame
there
were
no
hurried
words
no
pallor
no
plain
agitation
the
men
simply
looked
at
the
shore
now
remember
to
get
well
clear
of
the
boat
when
you
jump
said
the
captain
seaward
the
crest
of
a
roller
suddenly
fell
with
a
thunderous
crash
and
the
long
white
comber
came
roaring
down
upon
the
boat
steady
now
said
the
captain
the
men
were
silent
they
turned
their
eyes
from
the
shore
to
the
comber
and
waited
the
boat
slid
up
the
incline
leaped
at
the
furious
top
bounced
over
it
and
swung
down
the
long
back
of
the
wave
some
water
had
been
shipped
and
the
cook
bailed
it
out
but
the
next
crest
crashed
also
the
tumbling
boiling
flood
of
white
water
caught
the
boat
and
whirled
it
almost
perpendicular
water
swarmed
in
from
all
sides
the
correspondent
had
his
hands
on
the
gunwale
at
this
time
and
when
the
water
entered
at
that
place
he
swiftly
withdrew
his
fingers
as
if
he
objected
to
wetting
them
the
little
boat
drunken
with
this
weight
of
water
reeled
and
snuggled
deeper
into
the
sea
bail
her
out
cook
bail
her
out
said
the
captain
all
right
captain
said
the
cook
now
boys
the
next
one
will
do
for
us
sure
said
the
oiler
mind
to
jump
clear
of
the
boat
the
third
wave
moved
forward
huge
furious
implacable
it
fairly
swallowed
the
dingey
and
almost
simultaneously
the
men
tumbled
into
the
sea
a
piece
of
had
lain
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
as
the
correspondent
went
overboard
he
held
this
to
his
chest
with
his
left
hand
the
january
water
was
icy
and
he
reflected
immediately
that
it
was
colder
than
he
had
expected
to
find
it
off
the
coast
of
florida
this
appeared
to
his
dazed
mind
as
a
fact
important
enough
to
be
noted
at
the
time
the
coldness
of
the
water
was
sad
it
was
tragic
this
fact
was
somehow
so
mixed
and
confused
with
his
opinion
of
his
own
situation
that
it
seemed
almost
a
proper
reason
for
tears
the
water
was
cold
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
was
conscious
of
little
but
the
noisy
water
afterward
he
saw
his
companions
in
the
sea
the
oiler
was
ahead
in
the
race
he
was
swimming
strongly
and
rapidly
off
to
the
correspondent
left
the
cook
great
white
and
corked
back
bulged
out
of
the
water
and
in
the
rear
the
captain
was
hanging
with
his
one
good
hand
to
the
keel
of
the
overturned
dingey
there
is
a
certain
immovable
quality
to
a
shore
and
the
correspondent
wondered
at
it
amid
the
confusion
of
the
sea
it
seemed
also
very
attractive
but
the
correspondent
knew
that
it
was
a
long
journey
and
he
paddled
leisurely
the
piece
of
lay
under
him
and
sometimes
he
whirled
down
the
incline
of
a
wave
as
if
he
were
on
a
but
finally
he
arrived
at
a
place
in
the
sea
where
travel
was
beset
with
difficulty
he
did
not
pause
swimming
to
inquire
what
manner
of
current
had
caught
him
but
there
his
progress
ceased
the
shore
was
set
before
him
like
a
bit
of
scenery
on
a
stage
and
he
looked
at
it
and
understood
with
his
eyes
each
detail
of
it
as
the
cook
passed
much
farther
to
the
left
the
captain
was
calling
to
him
turn
over
on
your
back
cook
turn
over
on
your
back
and
use
the
oar
all
right
sir
the
cook
turned
on
his
back
and
paddling
with
an
oar
went
ahead
as
if
he
were
a
canoe
presently
the
boat
also
passed
to
the
left
of
the
correspondent
with
the
captain
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
keel
he
would
have
appeared
like
a
man
raising
himself
to
look
over
a
board
fence
if
it
were
not
for
the
extraordinary
gymnastics
of
the
boat
the
correspondent
marvelled
that
the
captain
could
still
hold
to
it
they
passed
on
nearer
to
shore
the
oiler
the
cook
the
captain
and
following
them
went
the
bouncing
gaily
over
the
seas
the
correspondent
remained
in
the
grip
of
this
strange
new
enemy
a
current
the
shore
with
its
white
slope
of
sand
and
its
green
bluff
topped
with
little
silent
cottages
was
spread
like
a
picture
before
him
it
was
very
near
to
him
then
but
he
was
impressed
as
one
who
in
a
gallery
looks
at
a
scene
from
brittany
or
holland
he
thought
i
am
going
to
drown
can
it
be
possible
can
it
be
possible
can
it
be
possible
perhaps
an
individual
must
consider
his
own
death
to
be
the
final
phenomenon
of
nature
but
later
a
wave
perhaps
whirled
him
out
of
this
small
deadly
current
for
he
found
suddenly
that
he
could
again
make
progress
toward
the
shore
later
still
he
was
aware
that
the
captain
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
keel
of
the
dingey
had
his
face
turned
away
from
the
shore
and
toward
him
and
was
calling
his
name
come
to
the
boat
come
to
the
boat
in
his
struggle
to
reach
the
captain
and
the
boat
he
reflected
that
when
one
gets
properly
wearied
drowning
must
really
be
a
comfortable
arrangement
a
cessation
of
hostilities
accompanied
by
a
large
degree
of
relief
and
he
was
glad
of
it
for
the
main
thing
in
his
mind
for
some
moments
had
been
horror
of
the
temporary
agony
he
did
not
wish
to
be
hurt
presently
he
saw
a
man
running
along
the
shore
he
was
undressing
with
most
remarkable
speed
coat
trousers
shirt
everything
flew
magically
off
him
come
to
the
boat
called
the
captain
all
right
captain
as
the
correspondent
paddled
he
saw
the
captain
let
himself
down
to
bottom
and
leave
the
boat
then
the
correspondent
performed
his
one
little
marvel
of
the
voyage
a
large
wave
caught
him
and
flung
him
with
ease
and
supreme
speed
completely
over
the
boat
and
far
beyond
it
it
struck
him
even
then
as
an
event
in
gymnastics
and
a
true
miracle
of
the
sea
an
overturned
boat
in
the
surf
is
not
a
plaything
to
a
swimming
man
the
correspondent
arrived
in
water
that
reached
only
to
his
waist
but
his
condition
did
not
enable
him
to
stand
for
more
than
a
moment
each
wave
knocked
him
into
a
heap
and
the
pulled
at
him
then
he
saw
the
man
who
had
been
running
and
undressing
and
undressing
and
running
come
bounding
into
the
water
he
dragged
ashore
the
cook
and
then
waded
towards
the
captain
but
the
captain
waved
him
away
and
sent
him
to
the
correspondent
he
was
naked
naked
as
a
tree
in
winter
but
a
halo
was
about
his
head
and
he
shone
like
a
saint
he
gave
a
strong
pull
and
a
long
drag
and
a
bully
heave
at
the
hand
the
correspondent
schooled
in
the
minor
formul√¶
said
thanks
old
man
but
suddenly
the
man
cried
what
that
he
pointed
a
swift
finger
the
correspondent
said
go
in
the
shallows
face
downward
lay
the
oiler
his
forehead
touched
sand
that
was
periodically
between
each
wave
clear
of
the
sea
the
correspondent
did
not
know
all
that
transpired
afterward
when
he
achieved
safe
ground
he
fell
striking
the
sand
with
each
particular
part
of
his
body
it
was
as
if
he
had
dropped
from
a
roof
but
the
thud
was
grateful
to
him
it
seems
that
instantly
the
beach
was
populated
with
men
with
blankets
clothes
and
flasks
and
women
with
and
all
the
remedies
sacred
to
their
minds
the
welcome
of
the
land
to
the
men
from
the
sea
was
warm
and
generous
but
a
still
and
dripping
shape
was
carried
slowly
up
the
beach
and
the
land
welcome
for
it
could
only
be
the
different
and
sinister
hospitality
of
the
grave
when
it
came
night
the
white
waves
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
moonlight
and
the
wind
brought
the
sound
of
the
great
sea
voice
to
the
men
on
shore
and
they
felt
that
they
could
then
be
interpreters
a
man
and
some
others
i
dark
mesquit
spread
from
horizon
to
horizon
there
was
no
house
or
horseman
from
which
a
mind
could
evolve
a
city
or
a
crowd
the
world
was
declared
to
be
a
desert
and
unpeopled
sometimes
however
on
days
when
no
arose
a
blue
shape
dim
of
the
substance
of
a
spectre
veil
appeared
in
the
and
a
pondering
might
remember
that
there
were
mountains
in
the
silence
of
these
plains
the
sudden
and
childish
banging
of
a
tin
pan
could
have
made
an
man
leap
into
the
air
the
sky
was
ever
flawless
the
manoeuvring
of
clouds
was
an
unknown
pageant
but
at
times
a
could
see
miles
away
the
long
white
streamers
of
dust
rising
from
the
feet
of
another
flock
and
the
interest
became
intense
bill
was
arduously
cooking
his
dinner
bending
over
the
fire
and
toiling
like
a
blacksmith
a
movement
a
flash
of
strange
colour
perhaps
off
in
the
bushes
caused
him
suddenly
to
turn
his
head
presently
he
arose
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
stood
motionless
and
gazing
he
perceived
at
last
a
mexican
winding
through
the
brush
toward
his
camp
hello
shouted
bill
the
mexican
made
no
answer
but
came
steadily
forward
until
he
was
within
some
twenty
yards
there
he
paused
and
folding
his
arms
drew
himself
up
in
the
manner
affected
by
the
villain
in
the
play
his
serape
muffled
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
his
great
sombrero
shaded
his
brow
being
unexpected
and
also
silent
he
had
something
of
the
quality
of
an
apparition
moreover
it
was
clearly
his
intention
to
be
mysterious
and
devilish
the
american
pipe
sticking
carelessly
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
was
twisted
until
the
wrong
side
was
uppermost
and
he
held
his
poised
in
the
air
he
surveyed
with
evident
surprise
this
apparition
in
the
mesquit
hello
jos√©
he
said
what
the
matter
the
mexican
spoke
with
the
solemnity
of
funeral
tollings
beel

geet

we
want

geet

in
bewilderment
and
his
jaw
fell
i
must
git
out
i
must
git
off
the
range
what
you
givin
us
the
mexican
unfolded
his
serape
with
his
small
yellow
hand
upon
his
face
was
then
to
be
seen
a
smile
that
was
gently
almost
caressingly
murderous
beel
he
said
geet
out
bill
arm
dropped
until
the
was
at
his
knee
finally
he
turned
again
toward
the
fire
go
on

little
yaller
rat
he
said
over
his
shoulder

the

in

vibrant
tone
thrusting
his
head
forward
and
moving
one
foot
you

keel
you
who

said
bill
i
and
the
others
the
mexican
tapped
his
breast
gracefully
bill
reflected
for
a
time
and
then
he
said
you
ai
got
no
manner
of
license
to
warn
me
this
range
and
i
wo

a
rod
understand

and
help

the
rear
till
the
shootin

done
because
goin
to
make
a
particular
of
shootin
you
through
the
chest
he
grinned
affably
and
made
a
gesture
of
dismissal
as
for
the
mexican
he
waved
his
hands
in
a
consummate
expression
of
indifference
oh
all
right
he
said
then
in
a
tone
of
deep
menace
and
glee
he
added
we
will
keel
you
eef
you
no
geet
they
have
decide
they
have
have
they
said
bill
well
you
tell
them
to
go
to
the
devil
ii
bill
had
been
a
in
wyoming
a
great
man
an
aristocrat
one
who
possessed
unlimited
credit
in
the
saloons
down
the
gulch
he
had
the
social
weight
that
could
interrupt
a
lynching
or
advise
a
bad
man
of
the
particular
merits
of
a
remote
geographical
point
however
the
fates
exploded
the
toy
balloon
with
which
they
had
amused
bill
and
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
was
a
professional
gambler
with
dealing
him
unspeakable
irritation
in
the
shape
of
three
big
cards
whenever
another
fellow
stood
pat
it
is
well
here
to
inform
the
world
that
bill
considered
his
calamities
of
life
all
dwarfs
in
comparison
with
the
excitement
of
one
particular
evening
when
three
kings
came
to
him
with
criminal
regularity
against
a
man
who
always
filled
a
straight
later
he
became
a
more
weirdly
abandoned
than
if
he
had
never
been
an
aristocrat
by
this
time
all
that
remained
of
his
former
splendour
was
his
pride
or
his
vanity
which
was
one
thing
which
need
not
have
remained
he
killed
the
foreman
of
the
ranch
over
an
inconsequent
matter
as
to
which
of
them
was
a
liar
and
the
midnight
train
carried
him
eastward
he
became
a
brakeman
on
the
union
pacific
and
really
gained
high
honours
in
the
hobo
war
that
for
many
years
has
devastated
the
beautiful
railroads
of
our
country
a
creature
of
himself
he
practised
all
the
ordinary
cruelties
upon
these
other
creatures
of
he
was
of
so
fierce
a
mien
that
tramps
usually
surrendered
at
once
whatever
coin
or
tobacco
they
had
in
their
possession
and
if
afterward
he
kicked
them
from
the
train
it
was
only
because
this
was
a
recognized
treachery
of
the
war
upon
the
hoboes
in
a
famous
battle
fought
in
nebraska
in
he
would
have
achieved
a
lasting
distinction
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
deserter
from
the
united
states
army
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
heroic
and
sweeping
charge
which
really
broke
the
power
of
the
hoboes
in
that
country
for
three
months
he
had
already
worsted
four
tramps
with
his
own
when
a
stone
thrown
by
the
baseman
of
f
troop
nine
laid
him
flat
on
the
prairie
and
later
enforced
a
stay
in
the
hospital
in
omaha
after
his
recovery
he
engaged
with
other
railroads
and
shuffled
cars
in
countless
yards
an
order
to
strike
came
upon
him
in
michigan
and
afterward
the
vengeance
of
the
railroad
pursued
him
until
he
assumed
a
name
this
mask
is
like
the
darkness
in
which
the
burglar
chooses
to
move
it
destroys
many
of
the
healthy
fears
it
is
a
small
thing
but
it
eats
that
which
we
call
our
conscience
the
conductor
of
no
stood
in
the
caboose
within
two
feet
of
bill
nose
and
called
him
a
liar
bill
requested
him
to
use
a
milder
term
he
had
not
bored
the
foreman
of
tin
can
ranch
with
any
such
request
but
had
killed
him
with
expedition
the
conductor
seemed
to
insist
and
so
bill
let
the
matter
drop
he
became
the
bouncer
of
a
saloon
on
the
bowery
in
new
york
here
most
of
his
fights
were
as
successful
as
had
been
his
brushes
with
the
hoboes
in
the
west
he
gained
the
complete
admiration
of
the
four
clean
who
stood
behind
the
great
and
glittering
bar
he
was
an
honoured
man
he
nearly
killed
bad
hennessy
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
more
reputation
than
ability
and
his
fame
moved
up
the
bowery
and
down
the
bowery
but
let
a
man
adopt
fighting
as
his
business
and
the
thought
grows
constantly
within
him
that
it
is
his
business
to
fight
these
phrases
became
mixed
in
bill
mind
precisely
as
they
are
here
mixed
and
let
a
man
get
this
idea
in
his
mind
and
defeat
begins
to
move
toward
him
over
the
unknown
ways
of
circumstances
one
summer
night
three
sailors
from
the
sat
in
the
saloon
drinking
and
attending
to
other
people
affairs
in
an
amiable
fashion
bill
was
a
proud
man
since
he
had
thrashed
so
many
citizens
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
the
loud
talk
of
the
sailors
was
very
offensive
so
he
swaggered
upon
their
attention
and
warned
them
that
the
saloon
was
the
flowery
abode
of
peace
and
gentle
silence
they
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
and
without
a
moment
pause
consigned
him
to
a
worse
place
than
any
stoker
of
them
knew
whereupon
he
flung
one
of
them
through
the
side
door
before
the
others
could
prevent
it
on
the
sidewalk
there
was
a
short
struggle
with
many
hoarse
epithets
in
the
air
and
then
bill
slid
into
the
saloon
again
a
frown
of
false
rage
was
upon
his
brow
and
he
strutted
like
a
savage
king
he
took
a
long
yellow
from
behind
the
and
started
importantly
toward
the
main
doors
to
see
that
the
incensed
seamen
did
not
again
enter
the
ways
of
sailormen
are
without
speech
and
together
in
the
street
the
three
sailors
exchanged
no
word
but
they
moved
at
once
landsmen
would
have
required
two
years
of
discussion
to
gain
such
unanimity
in
silence
and
immediately
they
seized
a
long
piece
of
scantling
that
lay
handily
with
one
forward
to
guide
the
and
with
two
behind
him
to
furnish
the
power
they
made
a
beautiful
curve
and
came
down
like
the
assyrians
on
the
front
door
of
that
saloon
mystic
and
still
mystic
are
the
laws
of
fate
bill
with
his
kingly
frown
and
his
long
appeared
at
precisely
that
moment
in
the
doorway
he
stood
like
a
statue
of
victory
his
pride
was
at
its
zenith
and
in
the
same
second
this
atrocious
piece
of
scantling
punched
him
in
the
bulwarks
of
his
stomach
and
he
vanished
like
a
mist
opinions
differed
as
to
where
the
end
of
the
scantling
landed
him
but
it
was
ultimately
clear
that
it
landed
him
in
texas
where
he
became
a
the
sailors
charged
three
times
upon
the
front
of
the
saloon
and
when
they
had
finished
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
the
victim
of
a
rural
fire
company
success
in
saving
it
from
the
flames
as
the
proprietor
of
the
place
surveyed
the
ruins
he
remarked
that
bill
was
a
very
zealous
guardian
of
property
as
the
ambulance
surgeon
surveyed
bill
he
remarked
that
the
wound
was
really
an
excavation
iii
as
his
mexican
friend
tripped
blithely
away
bill
turned
with
a
thoughtful
face
to
his
and
his
fire
after
dinner
he
drew
his
revolver
from
its
scarred
old
holster
and
examined
every
part
of
it
it
was
the
revolver
that
had
dealt
death
to
the
foreman
and
it
had
also
been
in
free
fights
in
which
it
had
dealt
death
to
several
or
none
bill
loved
it
because
its
allegiance
was
more
than
that
of
man
horse
or
dog
it
questioned
neither
social
nor
moral
position
it
obeyed
alike
the
saint
and
the
assassin
it
was
the
claw
of
the
eagle
the
tooth
of
the
lion
the
poison
of
the
snake
and
when
he
swept
it
from
its
holster
this
minion
smote
where
he
listed
even
to
the
battering
of
a
far
penny
wherefore
it
was
his
dearest
possession
and
was
not
to
be
exchanged
in
texas
for
a
handful
of
rubies
nor
even
the
shame
and
homage
of
the
conductor
of
no
during
the
afternoon
he
moved
through
his
monotony
of
work
and
leisure
with
the
same
air
of
deep
meditation
the
smoke
of
his
fire
was
curling
across
the
shadowy
sea
of
mesquit
when
the
instinct
of
the
plainsman
warned
him
that
the
stillness
the
desolation
was
again
invaded
he
saw
a
motionless
horseman
in
black
outline
against
the
pallid
sky
the
silhouette
displayed
serape
and
sombrero
and
even
the
mexican
spurs
as
large
as
pies
when
this
black
figure
began
to
move
toward
the
camp
bill
hand
dropped
to
his
revolver
the
horseman
approached
until
bill
was
enabled
to
see
pronounced
american
features
and
a
skin
too
red
to
grow
on
a
mexican
face
bill
released
his
grip
on
his
revolver
hello
called
the
horseman
hello
answered
bill
the
horseman
cantered
forward
good
evening
he
said
as
he
again
drew
rein
good
evenin
answered
bill
without
committing
himself
by
too
much
courtesy
for
a
moment
the
two
men
scanned
each
other
in
a
way
that
is
not
on
the
plains
where
one
is
in
danger
of
meeting
or
tourists
bill
saw
a
type
which
did
not
belong
in
the
mesquit
the
young
fellow
had
invested
in
some
mexican
trappings
of
an
expensive
kind
eyes
searched
the
outfit
for
some
sign
of
craft
but
there
was
none
even
with
his
local
regalia
it
was
clear
that
the
young
man
was
of
a
far
black
northern
city
he
had
discarded
the
enormous
stirrups
of
his
mexican
saddle
he
used
the
small
english
stirrup
and
his
feet
were
thrust
forward
until
the
steel
tightly
gripped
his
ankles
as
bill
eyes
travelled
over
the
stranger
they
lighted
suddenly
upon
the
stirrups
and
the
thrust
feet
and
immediately
he
smiled
in
a
friendly
way
no
dark
purpose
could
dwell
in
the
innocent
heart
of
a
man
who
rode
thus
on
the
plains
as
for
the
stranger
he
saw
a
tattered
individual
with
a
tangle
of
hair
and
beard
and
with
a
complexion
turned
from
the
sun
and
whisky
he
saw
a
pair
of
eyes
that
at
first
looked
at
him
as
the
wolf
looks
at
the
wolf
and
then
became
childlike
almost
timid
in
their
glance
here
was
evidently
a
man
who
had
often
stormed
the
iron
walls
of
the
city
of
success
and
who
now
sometimes
valued
himself
as
the
rabbit
values
his
prowess
the
stranger
smiled
genially
and
sprang
from
his
horse
well
sir
i
suppose
you
will
let
me
camp
here
with
you
eh
said
bill
i
suppose
you
will
let
me
camp
here
with
you
bill
for
a
time
seemed
too
astonished
for
words
well
he
answered
scowling
in
inhospitable
annoyance
well
i
do
believe
this
here
is
a
good
place
to
camp
mister
the
stranger
turned
quickly
from
his
what
he
said
in
surprise
you
do
want
me
here
you
do
want
me
to
camp
here
bill
feet
scuffled
awkwardly
and
he
looked
steadily
at
a
cactus
plant
well
you
see
mister
he
said
i
like
your
company
well
enough
but
you
see
some
of
these
here
greasers
are
goin
to
chase
me
off
the
range
and
while
i
might
like
a
man
company
all
right
i
could
let
him
in
for
no
such
game
when
he
ai
got
to
do
with
the
trouble
going
to
chase
you
off
the
range
cried
the
stranger
well
they
said
they
were
goin
to
do
it
said
bill
and
great
heavens
will
they
kill
you
do
you
think
do
know
ca
tell
till
afterwards
you
see
they
take
some
feller
that
alone
like
me
and
then
they
rush
his
camp
when
he
ai
quite
ready
for
and
ginerally
plug
with
a
load
before
he
has
a
chance
to
git
at
they
lay
around
and
wait
for
their
chance
and
it
comes
soon
enough
of
course
a
feller
alone
like
me
has
got
to
let
up
watching
some
time
maybe
they
ketch
asleep
maybe
the
feller
gits
tired
waiting
and
goes
out
in
broad
day
and
kills
two
or
three
just
to
make
the
whole
crowd
pile
on
him
and
settle
the
thing
i
heard
of
a
case
like
that
once
it
awful
hard
on
a
mind
to
git
a
gang
after
him
and
so
they
going
to
rush
your
camp
cried
the
stranger
how
do
you
know
who
told
you
feller
come
and
told
me
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
fight
do
see
nothin
else
to
do
answered
bill
gloomily
still
staring
at
the
cactus
plant
there
was
a
silence
finally
the
stranger
burst
out
in
an
amazed
cry
well
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
how
many
of
them
are
there
eight
answered
bill
and
now
you
ai
got
no
manner
of
business
foolin
around
here
just
now
and
you
might
better
lope
off
before
dark
i
do
ask
no
help
in
this
here
row
i
know
your
happening
along
here
just
now
do
give
me
no
call
on
you
and
you
better
hit
the
trail
well
why
in
the
name
of
wonder
do
you
go
get
the
sheriff
cried
the
stranger
oh
h
said
bill
iv
long
smoldering
clouds
spread
in
the
western
sky
and
to
the
east
silver
mists
lay
on
the
purple
gloom
of
the
wilderness
finally
when
the
great
moon
climbed
the
heavens
and
cast
its
ghastly
radiance
upon
the
bushes
it
made
a
new
and
more
brilliant
crimson
of
the
campfire
where
the
flames
capered
merrily
through
its
mesquit
branches
filling
the
silence
with
the
fire
chorus
an
ancient
melody
which
surely
bears
a
message
of
the
inconsequence
of
individual
tragedy
a
message
that
is
in
the
boom
of
the
sea
the
sliver
of
the
wind
through
the
the
silken
clash
of
hemlock
boughs
no
figures
moved
in
the
rosy
space
of
the
camp
and
the
search
of
the
moonbeams
failed
to
disclose
a
living
thing
in
the
bushes
there
was
no
clock
to
chant
the
weariness
of
the
long
silence
that
brooded
upon
the
plain
the
dew
gave
the
darkness
under
the
mesquit
a
velvet
quality
that
made
air
seem
nearer
to
water
and
no
eye
could
have
seen
through
it
the
black
things
that
moved
like
monster
lizards
toward
the
camp
the
branches
the
leaves
that
are
fain
to
cry
out
when
death
approaches
in
the
wilds
were
frustrated
by
these
uncanny
bodies
gliding
with
the
finesse
of
the
escaping
serpent
they
crept
forward
to
the
last
point
where
assuredly
no
frantic
attempt
of
the
fire
could
discover
them
and
there
they
paused
to
locate
the
prey
a
romance
relates
the
tale
of
the
black
cell
hidden
deep
in
the
earth
where
upon
entering
one
sees
only
the
little
eyes
of
snakes
fixing
him
in
menaces
if
a
man
could
have
approached
a
certain
spot
in
the
bushes
he
would
not
have
found
it
romantically
necessary
to
have
his
hair
rise
there
would
have
been
a
sufficient
expression
of
horror
in
the
feeling
of
the
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
in
his
rubber
two
of
these
bodies
finally
moved
toward
each
other
until
for
each
there
grew
out
of
the
darkness
a
face
placidly
smiling
with
tender
dreams
of
assassination
the
fool
is
asleep
by
the
fire
god
be
praised
the
lips
of
the
other
widened
in
a
grin
of
affectionate
appreciation
of
the
fool
and
his
plight
there
was
some
signaling
in
the
gloom
and
then
began
a
series
of
subtle
rustlings
interjected
often
with
pauses
during
which
no
sound
arose
but
the
sound
of
faint
breathing
a
bush
stood
like
a
rock
in
the
stream
of
firelight
sending
its
long
shadow
backward
with
painful
caution
the
little
company
travelled
along
this
shadow
and
finally
arrived
at
the
rear
of
the
bush
through
its
branches
they
surveyed
for
a
moment
of
comfortable
satisfaction
a
form
in
a
grey
blanket
extended
on
the
ground
near
the
fire
the
smile
of
joyful
anticipation
fled
quickly
to
give
place
to
a
quiet
air
of
business
two
men
lifted
with
much
of
the
barrels
gone
and
sighting
these
weapons
through
the
branches
pulled
trigger
together
the
noise
of
the
explosions
roared
over
the
lonely
mesquit
as
if
these
guns
wished
to
inform
the
entire
world
and
as
the
grey
smoke
fled
the
dodging
company
back
of
the
bush
saw
the
blanketed
form
twitching
whereupon
they
burst
out
in
chorus
in
a
laugh
and
arose
as
merry
as
a
lot
of
banqueters
they
gleefully
gestured
congratulations
and
strode
bravely
into
the
light
of
the
fire
then
suddenly
a
new
laugh
rang
from
some
unknown
spot
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
fearsome
laugh
of
ridicule
hatred
ferocity
it
might
have
been
demoniac
it
smote
them
motionless
in
their
gleeful
prowl
as
the
stern
voice
from
the
sky
smites
the
legendary
malefactor
they
might
have
been
a
weird
group
in
wax
the
light
of
the
dying
fire
on
their
yellow
faces
and
shining
athwart
their
eyes
turned
toward
the
darkness
whence
might
come
the
unknown
and
the
terrible
the
thing
in
the
grey
blanket
no
longer
twitched
but
if
the
knives
in
their
hands
had
been
thrust
toward
it
each
knife
was
now
drawn
back
and
its
owner
elbow
was
thrown
upward
as
if
he
expected
death
from
the
clouds
this
laugh
had
so
chained
their
reason
that
for
a
moment
they
had
no
wit
to
flee
they
were
prisoners
to
their
terror
then
suddenly
the
belated
decision
arrived
and
with
bubbling
cries
they
turned
to
run
but
at
that
instant
there
was
a
long
flash
of
red
in
the
darkness
and
with
the
report
one
of
the
men
shouted
a
bitter
shout
spun
once
and
tumbled
headlong
the
thick
bushes
failed
to
impede
the
route
of
the
others
the
silence
returned
to
the
wilderness
the
tired
flames
faintly
illumined
the
blanketed
thing
and
the
flung
corpse
of
the
marauder
and
sang
the
fire
chorus
the
ancient
melody
which
bears
the
message
of
the
inconsequence
of
human
tragedy
v
now
you
are
worse
off
than
ever
said
the
young
man
and
awed
no
i
ai
said
bill
rebelliously
i
one
ahead
after
reflection
the
stranger
remarked
well
there
seven
more
they
were
cautiously
and
slowly
approaching
the
camp
the
sun
was
flaring
its
first
warming
rays
over
the
grey
wilderness
upreared
twigs
prominent
branches
shone
with
golden
light
while
the
shadows
under
the
mesquit
were
heavily
blue
suddenly
the
stranger
uttered
a
frightened
cry
he
had
arrived
at
a
point
whence
he
had
through
openings
in
the
thicket
a
clear
view
of
a
dead
face
gosh
said
bill
who
at
the
next
instant
had
seen
the
thing
i
thought
at
first
it
was
that
there
jos√©
that
would
have
been
queer
after
what
i
told
yesterday
they
continued
their
way
the
stranger
wincing
in
his
walk
and
bill
exhibiting
considerable
curiosity
the
yellow
beams
of
the
new
sun
were
touching
the
grim
hues
of
the
dead
mexican
face
and
creating
there
an
inhuman
effect
which
made
his
countenance
more
like
a
mask
of
dulled
brass
one
hand
grown
curiously
thinner
had
been
flung
out
regardlessly
to
a
cactus
bush
bill
walked
forward
and
stood
looking
respectfully
at
the
body
i
know
that
feller
his
name
is
miguel
he
the
stranger
nerves
might
have
been
in
that
condition
when
there
is
no
backbone
to
the
body
only
a
long
groove
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
much
agitated
do
speak
that
way
what
way
said
bill
i
only
said
his
name
was
miguel
after
a
pause
the
stranger
said
oh
i
know
but
he
waved
his
hand
lower
your
voice
or
something
i
do
know
this
part
of
the
business
rattles
me
you
see
oh
all
right
replied
bill
bowing
to
the
other
mysterious
mood
but
in
a
moment
he
burst
out
violently
and
loud
in
the
most
extraordinary
profanity
the
oaths
winging
from
him
as
the
sparks
go
from
the
funnel
he
had
been
examining
the
contents
of
the
bundled
grey
blanket
and
he
had
brought
forth
among
other
things
his
it
was
now
only
a
rim
with
a
handle
the
mexican
volley
had
centered
upon
it
a
mexican
of
the
abbreviated
description
is
ordinarily
loaded
with
lead
pipe
old
horseshoes
sections
of
chain
window
weights
railroad
sleepers
and
spikes
and
any
other
junk
which
may
be
at
hand
when
one
of
these
loads
encounters
a
man
vitally
it
is
likely
to
make
an
impression
upon
him
and
a
may
be
supposed
to
subside
before
such
an
assault
of
curiosities
bill
held
high
his
desecrated
turning
it
this
way
and
that
way
he
swore
until
he
happened
to
note
the
absence
of
the
stranger
a
moment
later
he
saw
him
leading
his
horse
from
the
bushes
in
silence
and
sullenly
the
young
man
went
about
saddling
the
animal
bill
said
well
goin
to
pull
out
the
stranger
hands
fumbled
uncertainly
at
the
once
he
exclaimed
irritably
blaming
the
buckle
for
the
trembling
of
his
fingers
once
he
turned
to
look
at
the
dead
face
with
the
light
of
the
morning
sun
upon
it
at
last
he
cried
oh
i
know
the
whole
thing
was
all
square
enough
could
be
squarer
but
somehow
or
other
that
man
there
takes
the
heart
out
of
me
he
turned
his
troubled
face
for
another
look
he
seems
to
be
all
the
time
calling
me
a
he
makes
me
feel
like
a
murderer
but
said
bill
puzzling
you
did
shoot
him
mister
i
shot
him
i
know
but
i
feel
that
way
somehow
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
bill
considered
for
a
time
then
he
said
diffidently
mister
you
a
eddycated
man
ai
you
what
you
what
they
call
a
a
eddycated
man
ai
you
the
young
man
perplexed
evidently
had
a
question
upon
his
lips
when
there
was
a
roar
of
guns
bright
flashes
and
in
the
air
such
hooting
and
whistling
as
would
come
from
a
swift
flock
of
the
stranger
horse
gave
a
mighty
convulsive
spring
snorting
wildly
in
its
sudden
anguish
fell
upon
its
knees
scrambled
afoot
again
and
was
away
in
the
uncanny
death
run
known
to
men
who
have
seen
the
finish
of
brave
horses
this
comes
from
discussin
things
cried
bill
angrily
he
had
thrown
himself
flat
on
the
ground
facing
the
thicket
whence
had
come
the
firing
he
could
see
the
smoke
winding
over
the
he
lifted
his
revolver
and
the
weapon
came
slowly
up
from
the
ground
and
poised
like
the
glittering
crest
of
a
snake
somewhere
on
his
face
there
was
a
kind
of
smile
cynical
wicked
deadly
of
a
ferocity
which
at
the
same
time
had
brought
a
deep
flush
to
his
face
and
had
caused
two
upright
lines
to
glow
in
his
eyes
hello
jos√©
he
called
amiable
for
satire
sake
got
your
old
blunderbusses
loaded
up
again
yet
the
stillness
had
returned
to
the
plain
the
sun
brilliant
rays
swept
over
the
sea
of
mesquit
painting
the
far
mists
of
the
west
with
faint
rosy
light
and
high
in
the
air
some
great
bird
fled
toward
the
south
you
come
out
here
called
bill
again
addressing
the
landscape
and
i
give
you
some
shootin
lessons
that
ai
the
way
to
shoot
receiving
no
reply
he
began
to
invent
epithets
and
yell
them
at
the
thicket
he
was
something
of
a
master
of
insult
and
moreover
he
dived
into
his
memory
to
bring
forth
imprecations
tarnished
with
age
unused
since
fluent
bowery
days
the
occupation
amused
him
and
sometimes
he
laughed
so
that
it
was
uncomfortable
for
his
chest
to
be
against
the
ground
finally
the
stranger
prostrate
near
him
said
wearily
oh
gone
do
you
believe
it
replied
bill
sobering
swiftly
they
there
yet
every
man
of
how
do
you
know
because
i
do
they
wo
shake
us
so
soon
do
put
your
head
up
or
they
get
you
sure
bill
eyes
meanwhile
had
not
wavered
from
their
scrutiny
of
the
thicket
in
front
they
there
all
right
do
you
forget
it
now
you
listen
so
he
called
out
jos√©
ojo
jos√©
speak
up
i
want
have
talk
speak
up
you
yaller
cuss
you
whereupon
a
mocking
voice
from
off
in
the
bushes
said
se√±or
there
said
bill
to
his
ally
did
i
tell
you
the
whole
batch
again
he
lifted
his
voice
jos√©
look
ai
you
gittin
kinder
tired
you
better
go
home
you
fellers
and
git
some
rest
the
answer
was
a
sudden
furious
chatter
of
spanish
eloquent
with
hatred
calling
down
upon
bill
all
the
calamities
which
life
holds
it
was
as
if
some
one
had
suddenly
enraged
a
cageful
of
wild
cats
the
spirits
of
all
the
revenges
which
they
had
imagined
were
loosened
at
this
time
and
filled
the
air
they
in
a
holler
said
bill
chuckling
or
there
be
shootin
presently
he
began
to
grow
angry
his
hidden
enemies
called
him
nine
kinds
of
coward
a
man
who
could
fight
only
in
the
dark
a
baby
who
would
run
from
the
shadows
of
such
noble
mexican
gentlemen
a
dog
that
sneaked
they
described
the
affair
of
the
previous
night
and
informed
him
of
the
base
advantage
he
had
taken
of
their
friend
in
fact
they
in
all
sincerity
endowed
him
with
every
quality
which
he
no
less
earnestly
believed
them
to
possess
one
could
have
seen
the
phrases
bite
him
as
he
lay
there
on
the
ground
fingering
his
revolver
vi
it
is
sometimes
taught
that
men
do
the
furious
and
desperate
thing
from
an
emotion
that
is
as
even
and
placid
as
the
thoughts
of
a
village
clergyman
on
sunday
afternoon
usually
however
it
is
to
be
believed
that
a
panther
is
at
the
time
born
in
the
heart
and
that
the
subject
does
not
resemble
a
man
picking
mulberries
b
g
said
bill
speaking
as
from
a
throat
filled
with
dust
i
go
after
in
a
minute
do
you
budge
an
inch
cried
the
stranger
sternly
do
you
budge
well
said
bill
glaring
at
the
bushes
well
put
your
head
down
suddenly
screamed
the
stranger
in
white
alarm
as
the
guns
roared
bill
uttered
a
loud
grunt
and
for
a
moment
leaned
panting
on
his
elbow
while
his
arm
shook
like
a
twig
then
he
upreared
like
a
great
and
bloody
spirit
of
vengeance
his
face
lighted
with
the
blaze
of
his
last
passion
the
mexicans
came
swiftly
and
in
silence
the
lightning
action
of
the
next
few
moments
was
of
the
fabric
of
dreams
to
the
stranger
the
muscular
struggle
may
not
be
real
to
the
drowning
man
his
mind
may
be
fixed
on
the
far
straight
shadows
back
of
the
stars
and
the
terror
of
them
and
so
the
fight
and
his
part
in
it
had
to
the
stranger
only
the
quality
of
a
picture
half
drawn
the
rush
of
feet
the
spatter
of
shots
the
cries
the
swollen
faces
seen
like
masks
on
the
smoke
resembled
a
happening
of
the
night
and
yet
afterward
certain
lines
forms
lived
out
so
strongly
from
the
incoherence
that
they
were
always
in
his
memory
he
killed
a
man
and
the
thought
went
swiftly
by
him
like
the
feather
on
the
gale
that
it
was
easy
to
kill
a
man
moreover
he
suddenly
felt
for
bill
this
grimy
some
deep
form
of
idolatry
bill
was
dying
and
the
dignity
of
last
defeat
the
superiority
of
him
who
stands
in
his
grave
was
in
the
pose
of
the
lost
the
stranger
sat
on
the
ground
idly
mopping
the
sweat
and
from
his
brow
he
wore
the
gentle
idiot
smile
of
an
aged
beggar
as
he
watched
three
mexicans
limping
and
staggering
in
the
distance
he
noted
at
this
time
that
one
who
still
possessed
a
serape
had
from
it
none
of
the
grandeur
of
the
cloaked
spaniard
but
that
against
the
sky
the
silhouette
resembled
a
cornucopia
of
childhood
christmas
they
turned
to
look
at
him
and
he
lifted
his
weary
arm
to
menace
them
with
his
revolver
they
stood
for
a
moment
banded
together
and
hooted
curses
at
him
finally
he
arose
and
walking
some
paces
stooped
to
loosen
grey
hands
from
a
throat
swaying
as
if
slightly
drunk
he
stood
looking
down
into
the
still
face
struck
suddenly
with
a
thought
he
went
about
with
dulled
eyes
on
the
ground
until
he
plucked
his
gaudy
blanket
from
where
it
lay
dirty
from
trampling
feet
he
dusted
it
carefully
and
then
returned
and
laid
it
over
bill
form
there
he
again
stood
motionless
his
mouth
just
agape
and
the
same
stupid
glance
in
his
eyes
when
all
at
once
he
made
a
gesture
of
fright
and
looked
wildly
about
him
he
had
almost
reached
the
thicket
when
he
stopped
smitten
with
alarm
a
body
contorted
with
one
arm
stiff
in
the
air
lay
in
his
path
slowly
and
warily
he
moved
around
it
and
in
a
moment
the
bushes
nodding
and
whispering
their
turned
toward
the
scene
behind
him
swung
and
swung
again
into
stillness
and
the
peace
of
the
wilderness
the
bride
comes
to
yellow
sky
i
the
great
pullman
was
whirling
onward
with
such
dignity
of
motion
that
a
glance
from
the
window
seemed
simply
to
prove
that
the
plains
of
texas
were
pouring
eastward
vast
flats
of
green
grass
spaces
of
mesquit
and
cactus
little
groups
of
frame
houses
woods
of
light
and
tender
trees
all
were
sweeping
into
the
east
sweeping
over
the
horizon
a
precipice
a
pair
had
boarded
this
train
at
san
antonio
the
face
was
reddened
from
many
days
in
the
wind
and
sun
and
a
direct
result
of
his
new
black
clothes
was
that
his
hands
were
constantly
performing
in
a
most
conscious
fashion
from
time
to
time
he
looked
down
respectfully
at
his
attire
he
sat
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
like
a
man
waiting
in
a
barber
shop
the
glances
he
devoted
to
other
passengers
were
furtive
and
shy
the
bride
was
not
pretty
nor
was
she
very
young
she
wore
a
dress
of
blue
cashmere
with
small
reservations
of
velvet
here
and
there
and
with
steel
buttons
abounding
she
continually
twisted
her
head
to
regard
her
very
stiff
straight
and
high
they
embarrassed
her
it
was
quite
apparent
that
she
had
cooked
and
that
she
expected
to
cook
dutifully
the
blushes
caused
by
the
careless
scrutiny
of
some
passengers
as
she
had
entered
the
car
were
strange
to
see
upon
this
plain
countenance
which
was
drawn
in
placid
almost
emotionless
lines
they
were
evidently
very
happy
ever
been
in
a
before
he
asked
smiling
with
delight
no
she
answered
i
never
was
it
fine
ai
it
great
and
then
after
a
while
we
go
forward
to
the
diner
and
get
a
big
finest
meal
in
the
world
charge
a
dollar
oh
do
they
cried
the
bride
charge
a
dollar
why
that
too
much
for
us
ai
it
jack
not
this
trip
anyhow
he
answered
bravely
we
going
to
go
the
whole
thing
later
he
explained
to
her
about
the
train
you
see
it
a
thousand
miles
from
one
end
of
texas
to
the
other
and
this
train
runs
right
across
it
and
never
stops
but
four
times
he
had
the
pride
of
an
owner
he
pointed
out
to
her
the
dazzling
fittings
of
the
coach
and
in
truth
her
eyes
opened
wider
as
she
contemplated
the
figured
velvet
the
shining
brass
silver
and
glass
the
wood
that
gleamed
as
darkly
brilliant
as
the
surface
of
a
pool
of
oil
at
one
end
a
bronze
figure
sturdily
held
a
support
for
a
separated
chamber
and
at
convenient
places
on
the
ceiling
were
frescoes
in
olive
and
silver
to
the
minds
of
the
pair
their
surroundings
reflected
the
glory
of
their
marriage
that
morning
in
san
antonio
this
was
the
environment
of
their
new
estate
and
the
man
face
in
particular
beamed
with
an
elation
that
made
him
appear
ridiculous
to
the
negro
porter
this
individual
at
times
surveyed
them
from
afar
with
an
amused
and
superior
grin
on
other
occasions
he
bullied
them
with
skill
in
ways
that
did
not
make
it
exactly
plain
to
them
that
they
were
being
bullied
he
subtly
used
all
the
manners
of
the
most
unconquerable
kind
of
snobbery
he
oppressed
them
but
of
this
oppression
they
had
small
knowledge
and
they
speedily
forgot
that
unfrequently
a
number
of
travellers
covered
them
with
stares
of
derisive
enjoyment
historically
there
was
supposed
to
be
something
infinitely
humorous
in
their
situation
we
are
due
in
yellow
sky
at
he
said
looking
tenderly
into
her
eyes
oh
are
we
she
said
as
if
she
had
not
been
aware
of
it
to
evince
surprise
at
her
husband
statement
was
part
of
her
wifely
amiability
she
took
from
a
pocket
a
little
silver
watch
and
as
she
held
it
before
her
and
stared
at
it
with
a
frown
of
attention
the
new
husband
face
shone
i
bought
it
in
san
anton
from
a
friend
of
mine
he
told
her
gleefully
it
seventeen
minutes
past
twelve
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
a
kind
of
shy
and
clumsy
coquetry
a
passenger
noting
this
play
grew
excessively
sardonic
and
winked
at
himself
in
one
of
the
numerous
mirrors
at
last
they
went
to
the
two
rows
of
negro
waiters
in
dazzling
white
suits
surveyed
their
entrance
with
the
interest
and
also
the
equanimity
of
men
who
had
been
forewarned
the
pair
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
waiter
who
happened
to
feel
pleasure
in
steering
them
through
their
meal
he
viewed
them
with
the
manner
of
a
fatherly
pilot
his
countenance
radiant
with
benevolence
the
patronage
entwined
with
the
ordinary
deference
was
not
palpable
to
them
and
yet
as
they
returned
to
their
coach
they
showed
in
their
faces
a
sense
of
escape
to
the
left
miles
down
a
long
purple
slope
was
a
little
ribbon
of
mist
where
moved
the
keening
rio
grande
the
train
was
approaching
it
at
an
angle
and
the
apex
was
yellow
sky
presently
it
was
apparent
that
as
the
distance
from
yellow
sky
grew
shorter
the
husband
became
commensurately
restless
his
hands
were
more
insistent
in
their
prominence
occasionally
he
was
even
rather
and
far
away
when
the
bride
leaned
forward
and
addressed
him
as
a
matter
of
truth
jack
potter
was
beginning
to
find
the
shadow
of
a
deed
weigh
upon
him
like
a
leaden
slab
he
the
of
yellow
sky
a
man
known
liked
and
feared
in
his
corner
a
prominent
person
had
gone
to
san
antonio
to
meet
a
girl
he
believed
he
loved
and
there
after
the
usual
prayers
had
actually
induced
her
to
marry
him
without
consulting
yellow
sky
for
any
part
of
the
transaction
he
was
now
bringing
his
bride
before
an
innocent
and
unsuspecting
community
of
course
people
in
yellow
sky
married
as
it
pleased
them
in
accordance
with
a
general
custom
but
such
was
potter
thought
of
his
duty
to
his
friends
or
of
their
idea
of
his
duty
or
of
an
unspoken
form
which
does
not
control
men
in
these
matters
that
he
felt
he
was
heinous
he
had
committed
an
extraordinary
crime
face
to
face
with
this
girl
in
san
antonio
and
spurred
by
his
sharp
impulse
he
had
gone
headlong
over
all
the
social
hedges
at
san
antonio
he
was
like
a
man
hidden
in
the
dark
a
knife
to
sever
any
friendly
duty
any
form
was
easy
to
his
hand
in
that
remote
city
but
the
hour
of
yellow
sky
the
hour
of
daylight
was
approaching
he
knew
full
well
that
his
marriage
was
an
important
thing
to
his
town
it
could
only
be
exceeded
by
the
burning
of
the
new
hotel
his
friends
would
not
forgive
him
frequently
he
had
reflected
upon
the
advisability
of
telling
them
by
telegraph
but
a
new
cowardice
had
been
upon
him
he
feared
to
do
it
and
now
the
train
was
hurrying
him
toward
a
scene
of
amazement
glee
reproach
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
at
the
line
of
haze
swinging
slowly
in
toward
the
train
yellow
sky
had
a
kind
of
brass
band
which
played
painfully
to
the
delight
of
the
populace
he
laughed
without
heart
as
he
thought
of
it
if
the
citizens
could
dream
of
his
prospective
arrival
with
his
bride
they
would
parade
the
band
at
the
station
and
escort
them
amid
cheers
and
laughing
congratulations
to
his
adobe
home
he
resolved
that
he
would
use
all
the
devices
of
speed
and
plainscraft
in
making
the
journey
from
the
station
to
his
house
once
within
that
safe
citadel
he
could
issue
some
sort
of
a
vocal
bulletin
and
then
not
go
among
the
citizens
until
they
had
time
to
wear
off
a
little
of
their
enthusiasm
the
bride
looked
anxiously
at
him
what
worrying
you
jack
he
laughed
again
i
not
worrying
girl
i
only
thinking
of
yellow
sky
she
flushed
in
comprehension
a
sense
of
mutual
guilt
invaded
their
minds
and
developed
a
finer
tenderness
they
looked
at
each
other
with
eyes
softly
aglow
but
potter
often
laughed
the
same
nervous
laugh
the
flush
upon
the
face
seemed
quite
permanent
the
traitor
to
the
feelings
of
yellow
sky
narrowly
watched
the
speeding
landscape
we
nearly
there
he
said
presently
the
porter
came
and
announced
the
proximity
of
potter
home
he
held
a
brush
in
his
hand
and
with
all
his
airy
superiority
gone
he
brushed
potter
new
clothes
as
the
latter
slowly
turned
this
way
and
that
way
potter
fumbled
out
a
coin
and
gave
it
to
the
porter
as
he
had
seen
others
do
it
was
a
heavy
and
business
as
that
of
a
man
shoeing
his
first
horse
the
porter
took
their
bag
and
as
the
train
began
to
slow
they
moved
forward
to
the
hooded
platform
of
the
car
presently
the
two
engines
and
their
long
string
of
coaches
rushed
into
the
station
of
yellow
sky
they
have
to
take
water
here
said
potter
from
a
constricted
throat
and
in
mournful
cadence
as
one
announcing
death
before
the
train
stopped
his
eye
had
swept
the
length
of
the
platform
and
he
was
glad
and
astonished
to
see
there
was
no
one
upon
it
but
the
who
with
a
slightly
hurried
and
anxious
air
was
walking
toward
the
when
the
train
had
halted
the
porter
alighted
first
and
placed
in
position
a
little
temporary
step
come
on
girl
said
potter
hoarsely
as
he
helped
her
down
they
each
laughed
on
a
false
note
he
took
the
bag
from
the
negro
and
bade
his
wife
cling
to
his
arm
as
they
slunk
rapidly
away
his
glance
perceived
that
they
were
unloading
the
two
trunks
and
also
that
the
far
ahead
near
the
had
turned
and
was
running
toward
him
making
gestures
he
laughed
and
groaned
as
he
laughed
when
he
noted
the
first
effect
of
his
marital
bliss
upon
yellow
sky
he
gripped
his
wife
arm
firmly
to
his
side
and
they
fled
behind
them
the
porter
stood
chuckling
fatuously
ii
the
california
express
on
the
southron
railway
was
due
at
yellow
sky
in
minutes
there
were
six
men
at
the
bar
of
the
weary
gentleman
saloon
one
was
a
drummer
who
talked
a
great
deal
and
rapidly
three
were
texans
who
did
not
care
to
talk
at
that
time
and
two
were
mexican
who
did
not
talk
as
a
general
practice
in
the
weary
gentleman
saloon
the
dog
lay
on
the
that
crossed
in
front
of
the
door
his
head
was
on
his
paws
and
he
glanced
drowsily
here
and
there
with
the
constant
vigilance
of
a
dog
that
is
kicked
on
occasion
across
the
sandy
street
were
some
vivid
green
grass
plots
so
wonderful
in
appearance
amid
the
sands
that
burned
near
them
in
a
blazing
sun
that
they
caused
a
doubt
in
the
mind
they
exactly
resembled
the
used
to
represent
lawns
on
the
stage
at
the
cooler
end
of
the
a
man
without
a
coat
sat
in
a
tilted
chair
and
smoked
his
pipe
the
bank
of
the
rio
grande
circled
near
the
town
and
there
could
be
seen
beyond
it
a
great
plain
of
mesquit
save
for
the
busy
drummer
and
his
companions
in
the
saloon
yellow
sky
was
dozing
the
leaned
gracefully
upon
the
bar
and
recited
many
tales
with
the
confidence
of
a
bard
who
has
come
upon
a
new
field
and
at
the
moment
that
the
old
man
fell
with
the
bureau
in
his
arms
the
old
woman
was
coming
up
with
two
scuttles
of
coal
and
of
course
the
drummer
tale
was
interrupted
by
a
young
man
who
suddenly
appeared
in
the
open
door
he
cried
scratchy
wilson
drunk
and
has
turned
loose
with
both
hands
the
two
mexicans
at
once
set
down
their
glasses
and
faded
out
of
the
rear
entrance
of
the
saloon
the
drummer
innocent
and
jocular
answered
all
right
old
man
he
has
come
and
have
a
drink
anyhow
but
the
information
had
made
such
an
obvious
cleft
in
every
skull
in
the
room
that
the
drummer
was
obliged
to
see
its
importance
all
had
become
instantly
morose
say
said
he
mystified
what
is
this
his
three
companions
made
the
introductory
gesture
of
eloquent
speech
but
the
young
man
at
the
door
forestalled
them
it
means
my
friend
he
answered
as
he
came
into
the
saloon
that
for
the
next
two
hours
this
town
wo
be
a
health
resort
the
went
to
the
door
and
locked
and
barred
it
reaching
out
of
the
window
he
pulled
in
heavy
wooden
shutters
and
barred
them
immediately
a
solemn
gloom
was
upon
the
place
the
drummer
was
looking
from
one
to
another
but
say
he
cried
what
is
this
anyhow
you
do
mean
there
is
going
to
be
a
do
know
whether
there
be
a
fight
or
not
answered
one
man
grimly
but
there
be
some
shootin
some
good
shootin
the
young
man
who
had
warned
them
waved
his
hand
oh
there
be
a
fight
fast
enough
if
any
one
wants
it
anybody
can
get
a
fight
out
there
in
the
street
there
a
fight
just
waiting
the
drummer
seemed
to
be
swayed
between
the
interest
of
a
foreigner
and
a
perception
of
personal
danger
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
he
asked
scratchy
wilson
they
answered
in
chorus
and
will
he
kill
anybody
what
are
you
going
to
do
does
this
happen
often
does
he
rampage
round
like
this
once
a
week
or
so
can
he
break
in
that
door
no
he
ca
break
down
that
door
replied
the
tried
it
three
times
but
when
he
comes
you
better
lay
down
on
the
floor
stranger
he
dead
sure
to
shoot
at
it
and
a
bullet
may
come
through
thereafter
the
drummer
kept
a
strict
eye
on
the
door
the
time
had
not
yet
been
called
for
him
to
hug
the
floor
but
as
a
minor
precaution
he
sidled
near
to
the
wall
will
he
kill
anybody
he
said
again
the
men
laughed
low
and
scornfully
at
the
question
he
out
to
shoot
and
he
out
for
trouble
do
see
any
good
in
experimentin
with
him
but
what
do
you
do
in
a
case
like
this
what
do
you
do
a
man
responded
why
he
and
jack
potter
but
in
chorus
the
other
men
interrupted
jack
potter
in
san
anton
well
who
is
he
what
he
got
to
do
with
it
oh
he
the
he
goes
out
and
fights
scratchy
when
he
gets
on
one
of
these
tears
whow
said
the
drummer
mopping
his
brow
nice
job
he
got
the
voices
had
toned
away
to
mere
whisperings
the
drummer
wished
to
ask
further
questions
which
were
born
of
an
increasing
anxiety
and
bewilderment
but
when
he
attempted
them
the
men
merely
looked
at
him
in
irritation
and
motioned
him
to
remain
silent
a
tense
waiting
hush
was
upon
them
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
room
their
eyes
shone
as
they
listened
for
sounds
from
the
street
one
man
made
three
gestures
at
the
and
the
latter
moving
like
a
ghost
handed
him
a
glass
and
a
bottle
the
man
poured
a
full
glass
of
whisky
and
set
down
the
bottle
noiselessly
he
gulped
the
whisky
in
a
swallow
and
turned
again
toward
the
door
in
immovable
silence
the
drummer
saw
that
the
without
a
sound
had
taken
a
winchester
from
beneath
the
bar
later
he
saw
this
individual
beckoning
to
him
so
he
across
the
room
you
better
come
with
me
back
of
the
bar
no
thanks
said
the
drummer
perspiring
i
rather
be
where
i
can
make
a
break
for
the
whereupon
the
man
of
bottles
made
a
kindly
but
peremptory
gesture
the
drummer
obeyed
it
and
finding
himself
seated
on
a
box
with
his
head
below
the
level
of
the
bar
balm
was
laid
upon
his
soul
at
sight
of
various
zinc
and
copper
fittings
that
bore
a
resemblance
to
plate
armour
the
took
a
seat
comfortably
upon
an
adjacent
box
you
see
he
whispered
this
here
scratchy
wilson
is
a
wonder
with
a
gun
a
perfect
wonder
and
when
he
goes
on
the
we
hunt
our
holes
naturally
he
about
the
last
one
of
the
old
gang
that
used
to
hang
out
along
the
river
here
he
a
terror
when
he
drunk
when
he
sober
he
all
right
kind
of
simple
would
hurt
a
fly
nicest
fellow
in
town
but
when
he
drunk
whoo
there
were
periods
of
stillness
i
wish
jack
potter
was
back
from
san
anton
said
the
he
shot
wilson
up
once
in
the
leg
and
he
would
sail
in
and
pull
out
the
kinks
in
this
thing
presently
they
heard
from
a
distance
the
sound
of
a
shot
followed
by
three
wild
yells
it
instantly
removed
a
bond
from
the
men
in
the
darkened
saloon
there
was
a
shuffling
of
feet
they
looked
at
each
other
here
he
comes
they
said
iii
a
man
in
a
flannel
shirt
which
had
been
purchased
for
purposes
of
decoration
and
made
principally
by
some
jewish
women
on
the
east
side
of
new
york
rounded
a
corner
and
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
main
street
of
yellow
sky
in
either
hand
the
man
held
a
long
heavy
revolver
often
he
yelled
and
these
cries
rang
through
a
semblance
of
a
deserted
village
shrilly
flying
over
the
roofs
in
a
volume
that
seemed
to
have
no
relation
to
the
ordinary
vocal
strength
of
a
man
it
was
as
if
the
surrounding
stillness
formed
the
arch
of
a
tomb
over
him
these
cries
of
ferocious
challenge
rang
against
walls
of
silence
and
his
boots
had
red
tops
with
gilded
imprints
of
the
kind
beloved
in
winter
by
little
sledging
boys
on
the
hillsides
of
new
england
the
man
face
flamed
in
a
rage
begot
of
whisky
his
eyes
rolling
and
yet
keen
for
ambush
hunted
the
still
and
windows
he
walked
with
the
creeping
movement
of
the
midnight
cat
as
it
occurred
to
him
he
roared
menacing
information
the
long
revolvers
in
his
hands
were
as
easy
as
straws
they
were
moved
with
an
electric
swiftness
the
little
fingers
of
each
hand
played
sometimes
in
a
musician
way
plain
from
the
low
collar
of
the
shirt
the
cords
of
his
neck
straightened
and
sank
as
passion
moved
him
the
only
sounds
were
his
terrible
invitations
the
calm
adobes
preserved
their
demeanour
at
the
passing
of
this
small
thing
in
the
middle
of
the
street
there
was
no
offer
of
fight
no
offer
of
fight
the
man
called
to
the
sky
there
were
no
attractions
he
bellowed
and
fumed
and
swayed
his
revolver
here
and
everywhere
the
dog
of
the
of
the
weary
gentleman
saloon
had
not
appreciated
the
advance
of
events
he
yet
lay
dozing
in
front
of
his
master
door
at
sight
of
the
dog
the
man
paused
and
raised
his
revolver
humorously
at
sight
of
the
man
the
dog
sprang
up
and
walked
diagonally
away
with
a
sullen
head
and
growling
the
man
yelled
and
the
dog
broke
into
a
gallop
as
it
was
about
to
enter
an
alley
there
was
a
loud
noise
a
whistling
and
something
spat
the
ground
directly
before
it
the
dog
screamed
and
wheeling
in
terror
galloped
headlong
in
a
new
direction
again
there
was
a
noise
a
whistling
and
sand
was
kicked
viciously
before
it
the
dog
turned
and
flurried
like
an
animal
in
a
pen
the
man
stood
laughing
his
weapons
at
his
hips
ultimately
the
man
was
attracted
by
the
closed
door
of
the
weary
gentleman
saloon
he
went
to
it
and
hammering
with
a
revolver
demanded
drink
the
door
remaining
imperturbable
he
picked
a
bit
of
paper
from
the
walk
and
nailed
it
to
the
framework
with
a
knife
he
then
turned
his
back
contemptuously
upon
this
popular
resort
and
walking
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
spinning
there
on
his
heel
quickly
and
lithely
fired
at
the
bit
of
paper
he
missed
it
by
a
he
swore
at
himself
and
went
away
later
he
comfortably
fusiladed
the
windows
of
his
most
intimate
friend
the
man
was
playing
with
this
town
it
was
a
toy
for
him
but
still
there
was
no
offer
of
fight
the
name
of
jack
potter
his
ancient
antagonist
entered
his
mind
and
he
concluded
that
it
would
be
a
glad
thing
if
he
should
go
to
potter
house
and
by
bombardment
induce
him
to
come
out
and
fight
he
moved
in
the
direction
of
his
desire
chanting
apache
scalp
music
when
he
arrived
at
it
potter
house
presented
the
same
still
calm
front
as
had
the
other
adobes
taking
up
a
strategic
position
the
man
howled
a
challenge
but
this
house
regarded
him
as
might
a
great
stone
god
it
gave
no
sign
after
a
decent
wait
the
man
howled
further
challenges
mingling
with
them
wonderful
epithets
presently
there
came
the
spectacle
of
a
man
churning
himself
into
deepest
rage
over
the
immobility
of
a
house
he
fumed
at
it
as
the
winter
wind
attacks
a
prairie
cabin
in
the
north
to
the
distance
there
should
have
gone
the
sound
of
a
tumult
like
the
fighting
of
two
hundred
mexicans
as
necessity
bade
him
he
paused
for
breath
or
to
reload
his
revolvers
iv
potter
and
his
bride
walked
sheepishly
and
with
speed
sometimes
they
laughed
together
shamefacedly
and
low
next
corner
dear
he
said
finally
they
put
forth
the
efforts
of
a
pair
walking
bowed
against
a
strong
wind
potter
was
about
to
raise
a
finger
to
point
the
first
appearance
of
the
new
home
when
as
they
circled
the
corner
they
came
face
to
face
with
a
man
in
a
shirt
who
was
feverishly
pushing
cartridges
into
a
large
revolver
upon
the
instant
the
man
dropped
this
revolver
to
the
ground
and
like
lightning
whipped
another
from
its
holster
the
second
weapon
was
aimed
at
the
bridegroom
chest
there
was
a
silence
potter
mouth
seemed
to
be
merely
a
grave
for
his
tongue
he
exhibited
an
instinct
to
at
once
loosen
his
arm
from
the
woman
grip
and
he
dropped
the
bag
to
the
sand
as
for
the
bride
her
face
had
gone
as
yellow
as
old
cloth
she
was
a
slave
to
hideous
rites
gazing
at
the
apparitional
snake
the
two
men
faced
each
other
at
a
distance
of
three
paces
he
of
the
revolver
smiled
with
a
new
and
quiet
ferocity
tried
to
sneak
up
on
me
he
said
tried
to
sneak
up
on
me
his
eyes
grew
more
baleful
as
potter
made
a
slight
movement
the
man
thrust
his
revolver
venomously
forward
no
do
you
do
it
jack
potter
do
you
move
a
finger
towards
a
gun
just
yet
do
you
move
an
eyelash

time

for
me
to
settle
with
you
and
i
going
to

potter
looked
at
his
enemy
i
ai
got
a
gun
on
me
scratchy
he
said
honest
i
ai
he
was
stiffening
and
steadying
but
yet
somewhere
at
the
back
of
his
mind
a
vision
of
the
pullman
floated
the
figured
velvet
the
shining
brass
silver
and
glass
the
wood
that
gleamed
as
darkly
brilliant
as
the
surface
of
a
pool
of
oil
all
the
glory
of
their
marriage
the
environment
of
the
new
estate

his
enemy
face
went
livid
he
stepped
forward
and
lashed
his
weapon
to
and
fro
before
potter
chest
do

me

no
gun

a
man
in
texas

no
gun

me
for
no
kid
his
eyes
blazed
with
light
and
his
throat
worked
like
a
pump
i
ai
takin
you
for
no
kid
answered
potter
his
heels
had
not
moved
an
inch
backward

a
fool

i
ai
if

to

now
you
never

a
chance
like
this
again
so
much
enforced
reasoning
had
told
on
wilson
rage
he
was
calmer
if
you
ai
got
a
gun
why
ai
you
got
a
gun
he
sneered
been
to
sunday
school
i
ai
got
a
gun
because
i
just
come
from
san
anton
with
my
wife
i
married
said
potter
and
if
i
thought
there
was
going
to
be
any
galoots
like
you
prowling
around
when
i
brought
my
wife
home
had
a
gun
and
do
you
forget
it
married
said
scratchy
not
at
all
comprehending
yes
married
i
married
said
potter
distinctly
married
said
scratchy
seeming
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
drooping
drowning
woman
at
the
other
man
side
no
he
said
he
was
like
a
creature
allowed
a
glimpse
of
another
world
he
moved
a
pace
backward
and
his
arm
with
the
revolver
dropped
to
his
side
is
this
is
this
the
lady
he
asked
yes
this
is
the
lady
answered
potter
there
was
another
period
of
silence
well
said
wilson
at
last
slowly
i
it
all
off
now
it
all
off
if
you
say
so
scratchy
you
know
i
did
make
the
trouble
potter
lifted
his
valise
well
i
it
off
jack
said
wilson
he
was
looking
at
the
ground
married
he
was
not
a
student
of
chivalry
it
was
merely
that
in
the
presence
of
this
foreign
condition
he
was
a
simple
child
of
the
earlier
plains
he
picked
up
his
starboard
revolver
and
placing
both
weapons
in
their
holsters
he
went
away
his
feet
made
tracks
in
the
heavy
sand
the
wise
men
they
were
youths
of
subtle
mind
they
were
very
wicked
according
to
report
and
yet
they
managed
to
have
it
reflect
great
credit
upon
them
they
often
had
the
and
the
great
talkers
of
the
american
colony
engaged
in
reciting
their
misdeeds
and
facts
relating
to
their
sins
were
usually
told
with
a
flourish
of
awe
and
fine
admiration
one
was
from
san
francisco
and
one
was
from
new
york
but
they
resembled
each
other
in
appearance
this
is
an
idiosyncrasy
of
geography
they
were
never
apart
in
the
city
of
mexico
at
any
rate
excepting
perhaps
when
one
had
retired
to
his
hotel
for
a
respite
and
then
the
other
was
usually
camped
down
at
the
office
sending
up
servants
with
clamorous
messages
oh
get
up
and
come
on
down
they
were
two
lads
they
were
called
the
kids
and
far
from
their
mothers
occasionally
some
wise
man
pitied
them
but
he
usually
was
alone
in
his
wisdom
the
other
folk
frankly
were
transfixed
at
the
splendour
of
the
audacity
and
endurance
of
these
kids
when
do
those
boys
ever
sleep
murmured
a
man
as
he
viewed
them
entering
a
caf√©
about
eight
one
morning
their
smooth
infantile
faces
looked
bright
and
fresh
enough
at
any
rate
jim
told
me
he
saw
them
still
at
it
about
this
morning
sleep
ejaculated
a
companion
in
a
glowing
voice
they
never
sleep
they
go
to
bed
once
in
every
two
weeks
his
boast
of
it
seemed
almost
a
personal
pride
they
end
with
a
crash
though
if
they
keep
it
up
at
this
pace
said
a
gloomy
voice
from
behind
a
newspaper
the
caf√©
colorado
has
a
front
of
white
and
gold
in
which
is
set
larger
windows
than
are
commonly
to
be
found
in
mexico
two
little
wings
of
willow
incessantly
serve
as
doors
under
them
small
stray
dogs
go
furtively
into
the
caf√©
and
are
shied
into
the
street
again
by
the
waiters
on
the
there
is
always
a
decorative
effect
of
loungers
ranging
from
the
and
superior
tourist
to
the
old
veteran
of
the
silver
mines
bronzed
by
violent
suns
they
contemplate
with
various
shades
of
interest
the
show
of
the
street
the
red
purple
dusty
white
glaring
forth
against
the
walls
in
the
furious
sunshine
one
afternoon
the
kids
strolled
into
the
caf√©
colorado
a
of
the
men
who
sat
smoking
and
reading
with
a
sort
of
parisian
effect
at
the
little
tables
which
lined
two
sides
of
the
room
looked
up
and
bowed
smiling
and
although
this
coming
of
the
kids
was
anything
but
an
unusual
event
at
least
a
dozen
men
wheeled
in
their
chairs
to
stare
after
them
three
waiters
polished
tables
and
moved
chairs
noisily
and
appeared
to
be
eager
distinctly
these
kids
were
of
importance
behind
the
distant
bar
the
tall
form
of
old
pop
himself
awaited
them
smiling
with
broad
geniality
well
my
boys
how
are
you
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
profound
solicitude
he
allowed
five
or
six
of
his
customers
to
languish
in
the
care
of
mexican
bartenders
while
he
himself
gave
his
eloquent
attention
to
the
kids
lending
all
the
dignity
of
a
great
event
to
their
arrival
how
are
the
boys
eh
you
a
smooth
old
guy
said
one
eying
him
are
you
giving
us
this
welcome
so
we
wo
notice
it
when
you
push
your
worst
whisky
at
us
pop
turned
in
appeal
from
one
kid
to
the
other
kid
there
now
hear
that
will
you
he
assumed
an
oratorical
pose
why
my
boys
you
always
get
the
best
that
this
house
has
got
yes
we
do
the
kids
laughed
well
bring
it
out
anyhow
and
if
it
the
same
you
sold
us
last
night
we
grab
your
cash
register
and
run
pop
whirled
a
bottle
along
the
bar
and
then
gazed
at
it
with
a
rapt
expression
fine
as
silk
he
murmured
now
just
taste
that
and
if
it
is
the
best
whisky
you
ever
put
in
your
face
why
i
a
liar
that
all
the
kids
surveyed
him
with
scorn
and
poured
their
allowances
then
they
stood
for
a
time
insulting
pop
about
his
whisky
usually
it
tastes
exactly
like
new
parlour
furniture
said
the
san
francisco
kid
well
here
goes
and
you
want
to
look
out
for
your
cash
register
your
health
gentlemen
said
pop
with
a
grand
air
and
as
he
wiped
his
bristling
grey
moustaches
he
wagged
his
head
with
reference
to
the
cash
register
question
i
could
catch
you
before
you
got
very
far
why
are
you
a
runner
said
one
derisively
you
just
bank
on
me
my
boy
said
pop
with
deep
emphasis
i
a
flier
the
kids
sat
down
their
glasses
suddenly
and
looked
at
him
you
must
be
they
said
pop
was
tall
and
graceful
and
magnificent
in
manner
but
he
did
not
display
those
qualities
of
form
which
mean
speed
in
the
animal
his
hair
was
grey
his
face
was
round
and
fat
from
much
living
the
buttons
of
his
glittering
white
waistcoat
formed
a
fine
curve
so
that
if
the
concave
surface
of
a
piece
of
had
been
laid
against
pop
it
would
have
touched
every
button
you
must
be
observed
the
kids
again
well
you
can
laugh
all
you
like
but
no
jolly
now
boys
i
tell
you
i
a
winner
why
i
bet
you
i
can
skin
anything
in
this
town
on
a
square
go
when
i
kept
my
place
in
eagle
pass
there
was
anybody
who
could
touch
me
one
of
these
sure
things
came
down
from
san
anton
oh
he
was
a
runner
he
was
one
of
these
people
with
wings
well
i
skinned
what
certainly
i
did
never
touched
me
the
kids
had
been
regarding
him
in
grave
silence
but
at
this
moment
they
grinned
and
said
quite
in
chorus
oh
you
old
liar
pop
voice
took
on
a
whining
tone
of
earnestness
boys
i
telling
it
to
you
straight
i
a
flier
one
of
the
kids
had
had
a
dreamy
cloud
in
his
eye
and
he
cried
out
suddenly
say
what
a
joke
to
play
this
on
freddie
the
other
jumped
ecstatically
oh
would
it
though
say
he
do
a
thing
but
howl
he
go
crazy
they
looked
at
pop
as
if
they
longed
to
be
certain
that
he
was
after
all
a
runner
now
pop
on
the
level
said
one
of
them
wistfully
can
you
run
boys
swore
pop
i
a
peach
on
the
dead
level
i
a
peach
by
golly
i
believe
the
old
indian
can
run
said
one
to
the
other
as
if
they
were
alone
in
confidence
that
what
i
can
cried
pop
the
kids
said
well
so
long
old
man
they
went
to
a
table
and
sat
down
they
ordered
a
salad
they
were
always
ordering
salads
this
was
because
one
kid
had
a
wild
passion
for
salads
and
the
other
care
so
at
any
hour
of
the
day
they
might
be
seen
ordering
a
salad
when
this
one
came
they
went
into
a
sort
of
executive
session
it
was
a
very
long
consultation
men
noted
it
occasionally
the
kids
laughed
in
supreme
enjoyment
of
something
unknown
the
low
rumble
of
wheels
came
from
the
street
often
could
be
heard
the
cries
of
distant
vendors
the
sunlight
streamed
through
the
green
curtains
and
made
little
flitterings
on
the
marble
floor
high
up
among
the
severe
decorations
of
the
ceiling
reminiscent
of
the
days
when
the
great
building
was
a
palace
a
small
white
butterfly
was
wending
through
the
cool
air
spaces
the
long
billiard
hall
led
back
to
a
vague
gloom
the
balls
were
always
clicking
and
one
could
see
countless
crooked
elbows
beggars
slunk
through
the
wicker
doors
and
were
ejected
by
the
nearest
waiter
at
last
the
kids
called
pop
to
them
sit
down
pop
have
a
drink
they
scanned
him
carefully
say
now
pop
on
your
solemn
oath
can
you
run
boys
said
pop
piously
and
raising
his
hand
i
can
run
like
a
rabbit
on
your
oath
on
my
oath
can
you
beat
freddie
pop
appeared
to
look
at
the
matter
from
all
sides
well
boys
i
tell
you
no
man
is
ever
of
anything
in
this
world
and
i
do
want
to
say
that
i
can
best
any
man
but
i
seen
freddie
run
and
i
ready
to
swear
i
can
beat
him
in
a
hundred
yards
i
just
about

neat
you
understand
just
about
neat
freddie
is
a
good
average
runner
but
i
you
understand
i
just
a
little
bit
better
the
kids
had
been
listening
with
the
utmost
attention
pop
spoke
the
latter
part
slowly
and
meanfully
they
thought
he
intended
them
to
see
his
great
confidence
one
said
pop
if
you
throw
us
in
this
thing
we
come
here
and
drink
for
two
weeks
without
paying
we
back
you
and
work
a
josh
on
freddie
but
o
if
you
throw
us
to
this
menace
pop
cried
boys
i
make
the
run
of
my
life
on
my
oath
the
salad
having
vanished
the
kids
arose
all
right
now
they
warned
him
if
you
play
us
for
duffers
we
get
square
do
you
forget
it
boys
i
give
you
a
race
for
your
money
book
on
that
i
may
lose

better
man
but

skin
him
and
i
give

a
run
for
your
money

then
but
look
here
they
told
him
you
keep
your
face
closed
nobody
gets
in
on
this
but
us
understand
not
a
soul
pop
declared
they
left
him
gesturing
a
last
warning
from
the
wicker
doors
in
the
street
they
saw
benson
his
cane
gripped
in
the
middle
strolling
through
the
jabbering
natives
on
the
shady
side
they
semaphored
to
him
eagerly
he
came
across
cautiously
like
a
man
who
ventures
into
dangerous
company
we
going
to
get
up
a
race
pop
and
fred
pop
swears
he
can
skin
this
is
a
tip
keep
it
dark
say
wo
freddie
be
hot
benson
looked
as
if
he
had
been
compelled
to
endure
these
exhibitions
of
insanity
for
a
century
oh

fellows

old

pair
of
asses
pop
ca

any
faster
than
a
brick
the
kids
scowled
at
him
and
defiantly
said
ca
he
they
left
him
and
went
to
the
casa
verde
freddie
beautiful
in
his
white
jacket
was
holding
one
of
his
innumerable
conversations
across
the
bar
he
smiled
when
he
saw
them
where
you
boys
been
he
demanded
in
a
paternal
tone
almost
all
the
proprietors
of
american
caf√©s
in
the
city
used
to
adopt
a
paternal
tone
when
they
spoke
to
the
kids
oh
been
they
replied
have
a
drink
said
the
proprietor
of
the
casa
verde
forgetting
his
other
social
obligations
during
the
course
of
this
ceremony
one
of
the
kids
remarked
freddie
pop
says
he
can
beat
you
running
does
he
observed
freddie
without
excitement
he
was
used
to
various
snares
of
the
kids
that
what
he
says
he
can
leave
you
at
the
wire
and
not
see
you
again
well
he
lies
replied
freddie
placidly
and
i
bet
you
a
bottle
of
wine
that
he
can
do
it
too
rats
said
freddie
oh
that
all
right
pursued
a
kid
you
can
throw
bluffs
all
you
like
but
he
can
lose
you
in
a
hundred
yards
dash
you
bet
freddie
drank
his
whisky
and
then
settled
his
elbows
on
the
bar
say
now
what
do
you
boys
keep
coming
in
here
with
some
all
the
time
for
you
ca
josh
me
do
you
think
you
can
scare
me
about
pop
why
i
know
i
can
beat
him
he
ca
run
with
me
certainly
not
why
you
fellows
are
just
jollying
me
are
we
though
said
the
kids
you
dare
bet
the
bottle
of
wine
oh
of
course
i
can
bet
you
a
bottle
of
wine
said
freddie
disdainfully
nobody
cares
about
a
bottle
of
wine
but
well
make
it
five
then
advised
one
of
the
kids
freddie
hunched
his
shoulders
why
certainly
i
will
make
it
ten
if
you
like
but
we
do
they
said
ten
is
it
all
right
that
goes
a
look
of
weariness
came
over
freddie
face
but
you
boys
are
foolish
i
tell
you
pop
is
an
old
man
how
can
you
expect
him
to
run
of
course
i
no
great
runner
but
then
i
young
and
healthy
and
and
a
pretty
smooth
runner
too
pop
is
old
and
fat
and
then
he
does
do
a
thing
but
tank
all
day
it
a
cinch
the
kids
looked
at
him
and
laughed
rapturously
they
waved
their
fingers
at
him
ah
there
they
cried
they
meant
that
they
had
made
a
victim
of
him
but
freddie
continued
to
expostulate
i
tell
you
he
could
win
an
old
man
like
him
you
crazy
of
course
i
know
you
do
care
about
ten
bottles
of
wine
but
then
to
make
such
bets
as
that
twisted
are
we
though
cried
the
kids
in
mockery
they
had
precipitated
freddie
into
a
long
and
thoughtful
treatise
on
every
possible
chance
of
the
thing
as
he
saw
it
they
disputed
with
him
from
time
to
time
and
jeered
at
him
he
laboured
on
through
his
argument
their
childish
faces
were
bright
with
glee
in
the
midst
of
it
wilburson
entered
wilburson
worked
not
too
much
though
he
had
hold
of
the
mexican
end
of
a
great
importing
house
of
new
york
and
as
he
was
a
junior
partner
he
worked
but
not
too
much
though
what
the
howl
he
said
the
kids
giggled
we
got
freddie
rattled
why
said
freddie
turning
to
him
these
two
indians
are
trying
to
tell
me
that
pop
can
beat
me
running
like
the
devil
said
wilburson
incredulously
well
ca
he
demanded
a
kid
why
certainly
not
said
wilburson
dismissing
every
possibility
of
it
with
a
gesture
that
old
bat
certainly
not
i
bet
fifty
dollars
that
freddie
take
you
said
a
kid
what
said
wilburson
that
freddie
wo
beat
pop
the
kid
that
had
spoken
now
nodded
his
head
that
freddie
wo
beat
pop
repeated
wilburson
yes
it
a
go
why
certainly
retorted
wilburson
fifty
all
right
bet
you
five
bottles
on
the
side
ventured
the
other
kid
why
certainly
exploded
wilburson
wrathfully
you
fellows
must
take
me
for
something
easy
i
take
all
those
kinds
of
bets
i
can
get
cer
tain
ly
they
settled
the
details
the
course
was
to
be
paced
off
on
the
asphalt
of
one
of
the
adjacent
and
then
at
about
eleven
in
the
evening
the
match
would
be
run
usually
in
mexico
the
streets
of
a
city
grow
lonely
and
dark
but
a
little
after
nine
there
are
occasional
lurking
figures
perhaps
but
no
crowds
lights
and
noise
the
course
would
doubtless
be
undisturbed
as
for
the
policeman
in
the
vicinity
they
well
they
were
conditionally
amiable
the
kids
went
to
see
pop
they
told
him
of
the
arrangement
and
then
in
deep
tones
they
said
oh
pop
if
you
throw
us
pop
appeared
to
be
a
trifle
shaken
by
the
weight
of
responsibility
thrust
upon
him
but
he
spoke
out
bravely
boys
i
pinch
that
race
now
you
watch
me
i
pinch
it
the
kids
went
then
on
some
business
of
their
own
for
they
were
not
seen
again
till
evening
when
they
returned
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
caf√©
colorado
the
usual
stream
of
carriages
was
whirling
along
the
calle
the
wheels
hummed
on
the
asphalt
and
the
coachmen
towered
in
their
great
sombreros
on
the
sidewalk
a
gazing
crowd
sauntered
the
better
class
and
proud
in
their
derby
hats
and
coats
the
lower
classes
muffling
their
dark
faces
in
their
blankets
slipping
along
in
leather
sandals
an
electric
light
sputtered
and
fumed
over
the
throng
the
afternoon
shower
had
left
the
pave
wet
and
glittering
the
air
was
still
laden
with
the
odour
of
rain
on
flowers
grass
leaves
in
the
caf√©
colorado
a
cosmopolitan
crowd
ate
drank
played
billiards
gossiped
or
read
in
the
glaring
yellow
light
when
the
kids
entered
a
large
circle
of
men
that
had
been
gesticulating
near
the
bar
greeted
them
with
a
roar
here
they
are
now
oh
you
pair
of
peaches
say
got
any
more
money
to
bet
with
colonel
hammigan
grinning
pushed
his
way
to
them
say
boys
we
all
have
a
drink
on
you
now
because
you
wo
have
any
money
after
eleven
you
be
going
down
the
back
stairs
in
your
stocking
feet
although
the
kids
remained
unnaturally
serene
and
quiet
argument
in
the
caf√©
colorado
became
tumultuous
here
and
there
a
man
who
did
not
intend
to
bet
ventured
meekly
that
perchance
pop
might
win
and
the
others
swarmed
upon
him
in
a
whirlwind
of
angry
denial
and
ridicule
pop
enthroned
behind
the
bar
looked
over
at
this
storm
with
a
shadow
of
anxiety
upon
his
face
this
widespread
flouting
affected
him
but
the
kids
looked
blissfully
satisfied
with
the
tumult
they
had
stirred
blanco
honest
man
ever
worrying
for
his
friends
came
to
them
say
you
fellows
you
are
betting
too
much
this
thing
looks
kind
of
shaky
do
it
the
faces
of
the
kids
grew
sober
and
after
consideration
one
said
no
i
guess
we
got
a
good
thing
blanco
pop
is
going
to
surprise
them
i
think
well
do
all
right
old
boy
we
watch
out
from
time
to
time
the
kids
had
much
business
with
certain
orange
red
blue
purple
and
green
bills
they
were
making
little
memoranda
on
the
back
of
visiting
cards
pop
watched
them
closely
the
shadow
still
upon
his
face
once
he
called
to
them
and
when
they
came
he
leaned
over
the
bar
and
said
intensely
say
boys
remember
now
i
might
lose
this
race
nobody
can
ever
say
for
sure
and
if
i
do
why
oh
that
all
right
pop
said
the
kids
reassuringly
do
mind
it
do
your
derndest
and
let
it
go
at
that
when
they
had
left
him
however
they
went
to
a
corner
to
consult
say
this
is
getting
interesting
are
you
in
deep
asked
one
anxiously
of
his
friend
yes
pretty
deep
said
the
other
stolidly
are
you
deep
as
the
devil
replied
the
other
in
the
same
tone
they
looked
at
each
other
stonily
and
went
back
to
the
crowd
benson
had
just
entered
the
caf√©
he
approached
them
with
a
gloating
smile
of
victory
well
where
all
that
money
you
were
going
to
bet
right
here
said
the
kids
thrusting
into
their
waistcoat
pockets
at
eleven
a
curious
thing
was
learned
when
pop
and
freddie
the
kids
and
all
came
to
the
little
side
street
it
was
thick
with
people
it
seemed
that
the
news
of
this
race
had
spread
like
the
wind
among
the
americans
and
they
had
come
to
witness
the
event
in
the
darkness
the
crowd
moved
mumbling
in
argument
the
principals
the
kids
and
those
with
them
surveyed
this
scene
with
some
dismay
say
here
a
go
even
then
a
policeman
might
be
seen
approaching
the
light
from
his
little
lantern
flickering
on
his
white
cap
gloves
brass
buttons
and
on
the
butt
of
the
revolver
which
hung
at
his
belt
he
addressed
freddie
in
swift
mexican
freddie
listened
nodding
from
time
to
time
finally
freddie
turned
to
the
others
to
translate
he
says
he
get
into
trouble
if
he
allows
this
race
when
all
this
crowd
is
here
there
was
a
murmur
of
discontent
the
policeman
looked
at
them
with
an
expression
of
anxiety
on
his
broad
brown
face
oh
come
on
we
go
hold
it
on
some
other
fellow
beat
said
one
of
the
kids
the
group
moved
slowly
away
debating
suddenly
the
other
kid
cried
i
know
the
paseo
by
jiminy
said
freddie
just
the
thing
we
get
a
cab
and
go
out
to
the
paseo
keep
it
quiet
we
do
want
all
this
mob
later
they
tumbled
into
a
cab
pop
freddie
the
kids
old
colonel
hammigan
and
benson
they
whispered
to
the
men
who
had
wagered
the
paseo
the
cab
whirled
away
up
the
black
street
there
were
occasional
grunts
and
groans
cries
of
oh
get
off
me
feet
and
of
quit
killing
me
six
people
do
not
have
fun
in
one
cab
the
principals
spoke
to
each
other
with
the
respect
and
friendliness
which
comes
to
good
men
at
such
times
once
a
kid
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
looked
backward
he
pulled
it
in
again
and
cried
great
scott
look
at
that
would
you
the
others
struggled
to
do
as
they
were
bid
and
afterwards
shouted
holy
smoke
well
i
be
blowed
thunder
and
turf
galloping
after
them
came
innumerable
cabs
their
lights
twinkling
streaming
in
a
great
procession
through
the
night
the
street
is
full
of
them
ejaculated
the
old
colonel
the
paseo
de
la
reforma
is
the
famous
drive
of
the
city
of
mexico
leading
to
the
castle
of
chapultepec
which
last
ought
to
be
well
known
in
the
united
states
it
is
a
fine
broad
avenue
of
macadam
with
a
much
greater
quality
of
dignity
than
anything
of
the
kind
we
possess
in
our
own
land
it
seems
of
the
old
world
where
to
the
beauty
of
the
thing
itself
is
added
the
solemnity
of
tradition
and
history
the
knowledge
that
feet
in
buskins
trod
the
same
stones
that
cavalcades
of
steel
thundered
there
before
the
coming
of
carriages
when
the
americans
tumbled
out
of
their
cabs
the
giant
bronzes
of
aztec
and
spaniard
loomed
dimly
above
them
like
towers
the
four
roads
of
poplar
trees
rustled
weirdly
off
there
in
the
darkness
pop
took
out
his
watch
and
struck
a
match
well
hurry
up
this
thing
it
almost
midnight
the
other
cabs
came
swarming
the
drivers
lashing
their
horses
for
these
americans
who
did
all
manner
of
strange
things
nevertheless
always
paid
well
for
it
there
was
a
mighty
hubbub
then
in
the
darkness
five
or
six
men
began
to
pace
the
distance
and
quarrel
others
knotted
their
handkerchiefs
together
to
make
a
tape
men
were
swearing
over
bets
fussing
and
fuming
about
the
odds
benson
came
to
the
kids
swaggering
you
a
pair
of
asses
the
cabs
waited
in
a
solid
block
down
the
avenue
above
the
crowd
the
tall
statues
hid
their
visages
in
the
night
at
last
a
voice
floated
through
the
darkness
are
you
ready
there
everybody
yelled
excitedly
the
men
at
the
tape
pulled
it
out
straight
hold
it
higher
jim
you
fool
and
silence
fell
then
upon
the
throng
men
bended
down
trying
to
pierce
the
deep
gloom
with
their
eyes
from
out
at
the
starting
point
came
muffled
voices
the
crowd
swayed
and
jostled
the
racers
did
not
come
the
crowd
began
to
fret
its
nerves
burning
oh
hurry
up
shrilled
some
one
the
voice
called
again
ready
there
everybody
replied
yes
all
ready
hurry
up
there
was
a
more
muffled
discussion
at
the
starting
point
in
the
crowd
a
man
began
to
make
a
proposition
i
bet
twenty
but
the
crowd
interrupted
with
a
howl
here
they
come
the
body
of
men
swung
as
if
the
ground
had
moved
the
men
at
the
tape
shouldered
madly
at
their
fellows
bawling
keep
back
keep
back
from
the
distance
came
the
noise
of
feet
pattering
furiously
vague
forms
flashed
into
view
for
an
instant
a
hoarse
roar
broke
from
the
crowd
men
bended
and
swayed
and
fought
the
kids
back
near
the
tape
exchanged
another
stolid
look
a
white
form
shone
forth
it
grew
like
a
spectre
always
could
be
heard
the
wild
patter
a
scream
broke
from
the
crowd
by
gawd
it
pop
pop
pop
ahead
the
old
man
spun
towards
the
tape
like
a
madman
his
chin
thrown
back
his
grey
hair
flying
his
legs
moved
like
oiled
machinery
and
as
he
shot
forward
a
howl
as
from
forty
cages
of
wild
animals
went
toward
the
imperturbable
chieftains
in
bronze
the
crowd
flung
themselves
forward
oh
you
old
indian
you
savage
did
anybody
ever
see
such
running
ai
he
a
peach
well
where
the
kids
kids
look
at
him
would
you
did
you
ever
think
these
cries
flew
in
the
air
blended
in
a
vast
shout
of
astonishment
and
laughter
for
an
instant
the
whole
tragedy
was
in
view
freddie
desperate
his
teeth
shining
his
face
contorted
whirling
along
in
deadly
effort
was
twenty
feet
behind
the
tall
form
of
old
pop
who
dressed
only
in
his
only
in
his
underclothes
gained
with
each
stride
one
grand
insane
moment
and
then
pop
had
hurled
himself
against
the
tape
victor
freddie
fallen
into
the
arms
of
some
men
struggled
with
his
breath
and
at
last
managed
to
stammer
say
ca
ca
that
old
old
man
run
pop
puffing
and
heaving
could
only
gasp
where
my
shoes
who
got
my
shoes
later
freddie
scrambled
panting
through
the
crowd
and
held
out
his
hand
good
man
pop
and
then
he
looked
up
and
down
the
tall
stout
form
hell
who
would
think
you
could
run
like
that
the
kids
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
laughing
tempestuously
how
did
you
know
he
could
run
why
did
you
give
me
a
line
on
him
say
great
snakes
you
fellows
had
a
nerve
to
bet
on
pop
why
i
was
he
could
win
oh
you
fellows
must
have
seen
him
run
before
who
would
ever
think
it
benson
came
by
filling
the
midnight
air
with
curses
they
turned
to
jibe
him
what
the
matter
benson
somebody
pinched
my
handkerchief
i
tied
it
up
in
that
string
damn
it
the
kids
laughed
blithely
why
hello
benson
they
said
there
was
a
great
rush
for
cabs
shouting
laughing
wondering
the
crowd
hustled
into
their
conveyances
and
the
drivers
flogged
their
horses
toward
the
city
again
wo
freddie
be
crazy
say
he
be
guyed
about
this
for
years
but
who
would
ever
think
that
old
tank
could
run
so
one
cab
had
to
wait
while
pop
and
freddie
resumed
various
parts
of
their
clothing
as
they
drove
home
freddie
said
well
pop
you
beat
me
pop
said
that
all
right
old
man
the
kids
grinning
said
how
much
did
you
lose
benson
benson
said
defiantly
oh
not
so
much
how
much
did
you
win
oh
not
so
much
old
colonel
hammigan
squeezed
down
in
a
corner
had
apparently
been
reviewing
the
event
in
his
mind
for
he
suddenly
remarked
well
damned
they
were
late
in
reaching
the
caf√©
colorado
but
when
they
did
the
bottles
were
on
the
bar
as
thick
as
pickets
on
a
fence
the
five
white
mice
freddie
was
mixing
a
his
hand
with
the
long
spoon
was
whirling
swiftly
and
the
ice
in
the
glass
hummed
and
rattled
like
a
cheap
watch
over
by
the
window
a
gambler
a
millionaire
a
railway
conductor
and
the
agent
of
a
vast
american
syndicate
were
playing
freddie
surveyed
them
with
the
ironical
glance
of
a
man
who
is
mixing
a
from
time
to
time
a
swarthy
mexican
waiter
came
with
his
tray
from
the
rooms
at
the
rear
and
called
his
orders
across
the
bar
the
sounds
of
the
indolent
stir
of
the
city
awakening
from
its
siesta
floated
over
the
screens
which
barred
the
sun
and
the
inquisitive
eye
from
the
kitchen
could
be
heard
the
roar
of
the
old
french
driving
herding
and
abusing
his
mexican
helpers
a
string
of
men
came
suddenly
in
from
the
street
they
stormed
up
to
the
bar
there
were
impatient
shouts
come
now
freddie
do
stand
there
like
a
portrait
of
yourself
wiggle
drinks
of
many
kinds
and
colours
amber
green
mahogany
strong
and
mild
began
to
swarm
upon
the
bar
with
all
the
attendants
of
lemon
sugar
mint
and
ice
freddie
with
mexican
support
worked
like
a
sailor
in
the
provision
of
them
sometimes
talking
with
that
scorn
for
drink
and
admiration
for
those
who
drink
which
is
the
attribute
of
a
good
at
last
a
man
was
afflicted
with
a
stroke
of
a
herculean
discussion
was
waging
and
he
was
deeply
engaged
in
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
lazily
flirted
the
dice
occasionally
he
made
great
combinations
look
at
that
would
you
he
cried
proudly
the
others
paid
little
heed
then
violently
the
craving
took
them
it
went
along
the
line
like
an
epidemic
and
involved
them
all
in
a
moment
they
had
arranged
a
carnival
of
with
money
penalties
and
liquid
prizes
they
clamorously
made
it
a
point
of
honour
with
freddie
that
he
should
play
and
take
his
chance
of
sometimes
providing
this
large
group
with
free
refreshment
with
bended
heads
like
football
players
they
surged
over
the
tinkling
dice
jostling
cheering
and
bitterly
arguing
one
of
the
quiet
company
playing
at
the
corner
table
said
profanely
that
the
row
reminded
him
of
a
bowling
contest
at
a
picnic
after
the
regular
shower
many
carriages
rolled
over
the
smooth
calle
and
sent
a
musical
thunder
through
the
casa
verde
the
became
aglow
with
light
and
the
walks
were
crowded
with
youths
callow
and
ogling
dressed
vainly
according
to
superstitious
fashions
the
policemen
had
muffled
themselves
in
their
cloaks
and
placed
their
lanterns
as
obstacles
for
the
carriages
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
city
of
mexico
gave
forth
the
deep
tones
of
its
evening
resurrection
but
still
the
group
at
the
bar
of
the
casa
verde
were
shaking
dice
they
had
passed
beyond
shaking
for
drinks
for
the
crowd
for
mexican
dollars
for
dinners
for
the
wine
at
dinner
they
had
even
gone
to
the
trouble
of
separating
the
cigars
and
cigarettes
from
the
bill
and
causing
a
distinct
man
to
be
responsible
for
them
finally
they
were
aghast
nothing
remained
in
sight
of
their
minds
which
even
remotely
suggested
further
gambling
there
was
a
pause
for
deep
consideration
well
well
a
man
called
out
in
the
exuberance
of
creation
i
know
let
shake
for
a
box
at
the
circus
a
box
at
the
circus
the
group
was
profoundly
edified
that
it
that
it
come
on
now
box
at
the
circus
a
dominating
voice
cried
three
dashes
high
man
out
an
american
tall
and
with
a
face
of
copper
red
from
the
rays
that
flash
among
the
sierra
madres
and
burn
on
the
cactus
deserts
took
the
little
leathern
cup
and
spun
the
dice
out
upon
the
polished
wood
a
fascinated
assemblage
hung
upon
the
three
kings
turned
their
pink
faces
upward
the
tall
man
flourished
the
cup
burlesquing
and
flung
the
two
other
dice
from
them
he
ultimately
extracted
one
more
pink
king
there
he
said
now
let
see
four
kings
he
began
to
swagger
in
a
sort
of
provisional
way
the
next
man
took
the
cup
and
blew
softly
in
the
top
of
it
poising
it
in
his
hand
he
then
surveyed
the
company
with
a
stony
eye
and
paused
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
applying
the
magic
of
deliberation
and
ostentatious
indifference
but
they
could
not
wait
in
tranquillity
during
the
performance
of
all
these
rites
they
began
to
call
out
impatiently
come
now
hurry
up
at
last
the
man
with
a
gesture
that
was
singularly
impressive
threw
the
dice
the
others
set
up
a
howl
of
joy
not
a
pair
there
was
another
solemn
pause
the
men
moved
restlessly
come
now
go
ahead
in
the
end
the
man
induced
and
abused
achieved
something
that
was
nothing
in
the
presence
of
four
kings
the
tall
man
climbed
on
the
and
leaned
hazardously
forward
four
kings
my
four
kings
are
good
to
go
out
he
bellowed
into
the
middle
of
the
mob
and
although
in
a
moment
he
did
pass
into
the
radiant
region
of
exemption
he
continued
to
bawl
advice
and
scorn
the
mirrors
and
oiled
woods
of
the
casa
verde
were
now
dancing
with
blue
flashes
from
a
great
buzzing
electric
lamp
a
host
of
quiet
members
of
the
colony
had
come
in
for
their
an
amiable
person
was
exhibiting
to
some
tourists
this
popular
american
saloon
it
was
a
very
sober
and
respectable
time
of
day
freddie
reproved
courageously
the
brawlers
and
in
return
he
received
the
choicest
advice
in
a
tumult
of
seven
combined
vocabularies
he
laughed
he
had
been
compelled
to
retire
from
the
game
but
he
was
keeping
an
interested
if
furtive
eye
upon
it
down
at
the
end
of
the
line
there
was
a
youth
at
whom
everybody
railed
for
his
flaming
at
each
disaster
freddie
swore
from
behind
the
bar
in
a
sort
of
affectionate
contempt
why
this
kid
has
had
no
luck
for
two
days
did
you
ever
see
such
throwin
the
contest
narrowed
eventually
to
the
new
york
kid
and
an
individual
who
swung
about
placidly
on
legs
that
moved
in
nefarious
circles
he
had
a
grin
that
resembled
a
bit
of
carving
he
was
obliged
to
lean
down
and
blink
rapidly
to
ascertain
the
facts
of
his
venture
but
fate
presented
him
with
five
queens
his
smile
did
not
change
but
he
puffed
gently
like
a
man
who
has
been
running
the
others
having
emerged
unscathed
from
this
part
of
the
conflict
waxed
hilarious
with
the
kid
they
smote
him
on
either
shoulders
we
got
you
stuck
for
it
kid
you
ca
beat
that
game
five
queens
up
to
this
time
the
kid
had
displayed
only
the
temper
of
the
gambler
but
the
cheerful
hoots
of
the
players
supplemented
now
by
a
ring
of
guying
caused
him
to
feel
profoundly
that
it
would
be
fine
to
beat
the
five
queens
he
addressed
a
gambler
slogan
to
the
interior
of
the
cup
oh
five
white
mice
of
chance
shirts
of
wool
and
corduroy
pants
gold
and
wine
women
and
sin
all
for
you
if
you
let
me
come
in
into
the
house
of
chance
flashing
the
dice
sardonically
out
upon
the
bar
he
displayed
three
aces
from
two
dice
in
the
next
throw
he
achieved
one
more
ace
for
his
last
throw
he
rattled
the
single
dice
for
a
long
time
he
already
had
four
aces
if
he
accomplished
another
one
the
five
queens
were
vanquished
and
the
box
at
the
circus
came
from
the
drunken
pocket
all
the
kid
movements
were
slow
and
elaborate
for
the
last
throw
he
planted
the
cup
on
the
bar
with
the
one
dice
hidden
under
it
then
he
turned
and
faced
the
crowd
with
the
air
of
a
conjuror
or
a
cheat
oh
maybe
it
an
ace
he
said
in
boastful
calm
maybe
it
an
ace
instantly
he
was
presiding
over
a
little
drama
in
which
every
man
was
absorbed
the
kid
leaned
with
his
back
against
the
and
with
his
elbows
upon
it
maybe
it
an
ace
he
repeated
a
jeering
voice
in
the
background
said
yes
maybe
it
is
kid
the
kid
eyes
searched
for
a
moment
among
the
men
i
bet
fifty
dollars
it
is
an
ace
he
said
another
voice
asked
american
money
yes
answered
the
kid
oh
there
was
a
genial
laugh
at
this
discomfiture
however
no
one
came
forward
at
the
kid
challenge
and
presently
he
turned
to
the
cup
now
i
show
you
with
the
manner
of
a
mayor
unveiling
a
statue
he
lifted
the
cup
there
was
revealed
naught
but
a
in
the
roar
which
arose
could
be
heard
each
man
ridiculing
the
cowardice
of
his
neighbour
and
above
all
the
din
rang
the
voice
of
freddie
every
one
why
there
is
one
liver
to
every
five
men
in
the
outfit
that
was
the
greatest
cold
bluff
i
ever
saw
worked
he
would
know
how
to
cheat
with
dice
if
he
wanted
to
do
know
the
first
thing
about
it
i
could
hardly
keep
from
laughin
when
i
seen
him
drillin
you
around
why
i
tell
you
i
had
that
fifty
dollars
right
in
my
pocket
if
i
wanted
to
be
a
chump
you
an
easy
lot
nevertheless
the
group
who
had
won
in
the
game
did
not
relinquish
their
triumph
they
burst
like
a
storm
about
the
head
of
the
kid
swinging
at
him
with
their
fists
white
mice
they
quoted
choking
white
mice
oh
they
are
not
so
bad
said
the
kid
afterward
it
often
occurred
that
a
man
would
jeer
a
finger
at
the
kid
and
derisively
say
white
mice
on
the
route
from
the
dinner
to
the
circus
others
of
the
party
often
asked
the
kid
if
he
had
really
intended
to
make
his
appeal
to
mice
they
suggested
other
animals
rabbits
dogs
hedgehogs
snakes
opossums
to
this
banter
the
kid
replied
with
a
serious
expression
of
his
belief
in
the
fidelity
and
wisdom
of
the
five
white
mice
he
presented
a
most
eloquent
case
decorated
with
fine
language
and
insults
in
which
he
proved
that
if
one
was
going
to
believe
in
anything
at
all
one
might
as
well
choose
the
five
white
mice
his
companions
however
at
once
and
unanimously
pointed
out
to
him
that
his
recent
exploit
did
not
place
him
in
the
light
of
a
convincing
advocate
the
kid
discerned
two
figures
in
the
street
they
were
making
imperious
signs
at
him
he
waited
for
them
to
approach
for
he
recognized
one
as
the
other
kid
the
frisco
kid
there
were
two
kids
with
the
frisco
kid
was
benson
they
arrived
almost
breathless
where
you
been
cried
the
frisco
kid
it
was
an
arrangement
that
upon
a
meeting
the
one
that
could
first
ask
this
question
was
entitled
to
use
a
tone
of
limitless
injury
what
you
been
doing
where
you
going
come
on
with
us
benson
and
i
have
got
a
little
scheme
the
new
york
kid
pulled
his
arm
from
the
grapple
of
the
other
i
ca
i
got
to
take
these
sutlers
to
the
circus
they
stuck
me
for
it
shaking
dice
at
freddie
i
ca
i
tell
you
the
two
did
not
at
first
attend
to
his
remarks
come
on
we
got
a
little
scheme
i
ca
they
stuck
me
i
got
to
take
to
the
circus
at
this
time
it
did
not
suit
the
men
with
the
scheme
to
recognize
these
objections
as
important
oh
take
some
other
time
well
ca
you
take
some
other
time
let
go
damn
the
circus
get
cold
feet
what
did
you
get
stuck
for
get
cold
feet
but
despite
their
fighting
the
new
york
kid
broke
away
from
them
i
ca
i
tell
you
they
stuck
me
as
he
left
them
they
yelled
with
rage
well
meet
us
now
do
you
hear
in
the
casa
verde
as
soon
as
the
circus
quits
hear
they
threw
maledictions
after
him
in
the
city
of
mexico
a
man
goes
to
the
circus
without
descending
in
any
way
to
infant
amusements
because
the
circo
teatro
orrin
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
and
too
easily
surpasses
anything
of
the
kind
in
the
united
states
where
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
a
number
of
rings
if
possible
and
a
great
professional
agreement
to
lie
to
the
public
moreover
the
american
clown
who
in
the
mexican
arena
prances
and
gabbles
is
the
clown
to
whom
writers
refer
as
the
delight
of
their
childhood
and
lament
that
he
is
dead
at
this
circus
the
kid
was
not
debased
by
the
sight
of
mournful
prisoner
elephants
and
caged
animals
forlorn
and
sickly
he
sat
in
his
box
until
late
and
laughed
and
swore
when
past
laughing
at
the
comic
clown
when
he
returned
to
the
casa
verde
there
was
no
display
of
the
frisco
kid
and
benson
freddie
was
leaning
on
the
bar
listening
to
four
men
terribly
discuss
a
question
that
was
not
plain
there
was
a
in
the
corner
of
course
sounds
of
revelry
pealed
from
the
rear
rooms
when
the
kid
asked
freddie
if
he
had
seen
his
friend
and
benson
freddie
looked
bored
oh
yes
they
were
in
here
just
a
minute
ago
but
i
do
know
where
they
went
they
got
their
skates
on
they
been
came
in
here
rolling
across
the
floor
like
two
little
gilt
gods
they
wobbled
around
for
a
time
and
then
frisco
wanted
me
to
send
six
bottles
of
wine
around
to
benson
rooms
but
i
did
have
anybody
to
send
this
time
of
night
and
so
they
got
mad
and
went
out
where
did
they
get
their
loads
in
the
first
deep
gloom
of
the
street
the
kid
paused
a
moment
debating
but
presently
he
heard
quavering
voices
oh
kid
kid
peering
he
recognized
two
vague
figures
against
the
opposite
wall
he
crossed
the
street
and
they
said
say
where
did
you
get
it
he
demanded
sternly
you
indians
better
go
home
what
did
you
want
to
get
scragged
for
his
face
was
luminous
with
virtue
as
they
swung
to
and
fro
they
made
angry
denials
we
ain
load
we
ain

the
sober
youth
turned
then
to
his
friend
had
you
better
go
home
kid
come
on
it
late
you
better
break
away
the
frisco
kid
wagged
his
head
decisively

wallowing
around
in
a
minute
do

benson
arousing
from
deep
thought
all

but

but
he
all

he
looked
at
his
companion
with
compassion

the
sober
kid
spoke
abruptly
to
his
friend
from
san
francisco
kid
pull
yourself
together
now
do
fool
we
got
to
brace
this
ass
of
a
benson
all
the
way
home
get
hold
of
his
other
arm
the
frisco
kid
immediately
obeyed
his
comrade
without
a
word
or
a
glower
he
seized
benson
and
came
to
attention
like
a
soldier
later
indeed
he
meekly
ventured
ca
we
take
cab
but
when
the
new
york
kid
snapped
out
that
there
were
no
convenient
cabs
he
subsided
to
an
impassive
silence
he
seemed
to
be
reflecting
upon
his
state
without
astonishment
dismay
or
any
particular
emotion
he
submitted
himself
woodenly
to
the
direction
of
his
friend
benson
had
protested
when
they
had
grasped
his
arms
washa
doing
he
said
in
a
new
and
guttural
voice
washa
doing
i
ain

comonangetadrink
i
oh
come
along
you
idiot
said
the
new
york
kid
the
frisco
kid
merely
presented
the
mien
of
a
stoic
to
the
appeal
of
benson
and
in
silence
dragged
away
at
one
of
his
arms
benson
feet
came
from
that
particular
spot
on
the
pavement
with
the
reluctance
of
roots
and
also
with
the
ultimate
suddenness
of
roots
the
three
of
them
lurched
out
into
the
street
in
the
abandon
of
tumbling
chimneys
benson
was
meanwhile
noisily
challenging
the
others
to
produce
any
reasons
for
his
being
taken
home
his
toes
clashed
into
the
kerb
when
they
reached
the
other
side
of
the
calle
and
for
a
moment
the
kids
hauled
him
along
with
the
points
of
his
shoes
scraping
musically
on
the
pavement
he
balked
formidably
as
they
were
about
to
pass
the
casa
verde
no
no
leshavanothdrink
anothdrink
onemore
but
the
frisco
kid
obeyed
the
voice
of
his
partner
in
a
manner
that
was
blind
but
absolute
and
they
scummed
benson
on
past
the
door
locked
together
the
three
swung
into
a
dark
street
the
sober
kid
flank
was
continually
careering
ahead
of
the
other
wing
he
harshly
admonished
the
frisco
child
and
the
latter
promptly
improved
in
the
same
manner
of
unthinking
complete
obedience
benson
began
to
recite
the
tale
of
a
love
affair
a
tale
that
did
even
have
a
middle
occasionally
the
new
york
kid
swore
they
toppled
on
their
way
like
three
comedians
playing
at
it
on
the
stage
at
midnight
a
little
mexican
street
burrowing
among
the
walls
of
the
city
is
as
dark
as
a
whale
throat
at
deep
sea
upon
this
occasion
heavy
clouds
hung
over
the
capital
and
the
sky
was
a
pall
the
projecting
balconies
could
make
no
shadows
shay
said
benson
breaking
away
from
his
escort
suddenly
what

said
the
new

kid
come

all
night
benson
refused
to
be
corralled
but
spread
his
legs
and
twirled
like
a
dervish
meanwhile
under
the
evident
impression
that
he
was
conducting
himself
most
handsomely
it
was
not
long
before
he
gained
the
opinion
that
he
was
laughing
at
the
others

what

as
benson
describing
the
canine
phenomena
swung
wildly
across
the
sidewalk
it
chanced
that
three
other
pedestrians
were
passing
in
shadowy
rank
benson
shoulder
jostled
one
of
them
a
mexican
wheeled
upon
the
instant
his
hand
flashed
to
his
hip
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
during
which
benson
voice
was
not
heard
raised
in
apology
then
an
indescribable
comment
one
burning
word
came
from
between
the
mexican
teeth
benson
rolling
about
in
a
manner
stared
vacantly
at
the
mexican
who
thrust
his
lean
face
forward
while
his
fingers
played
nervously
at
his
hip
the
new
york
kid
could
not
follow
spanish
well
but
he
understood
when
the
mexican
breathed
softly
does
the
se√±or
want
to
fight
benson
simply
gazed
in
gentle
surprise
the
woman
next
to
him
at
dinner
had
said
something
inventive
his
tailor
had
presented
his
bill
something
had
occurred
which
was
mildly
out
of
the
ordinary
and
his
surcharged
brain
refused
to
cope
with
it
he
displayed
only
the
agitation
of
a
smoker
temporarily
without
a
light
the
new
york
kid
had
almost
instantly
grasped
benson
arm
and
was
about
to
jerk
him
away
when
the
other
kid
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
an
automaton
suddenly
projected
himself
forward
thrust
the
rubber
benson
aside
and
said
yes
there
was
no
sound
nor
light
in
the
world
the
wall
at
the
left
happened
to
be
of
the
common
construction
no
door
no
window
no
opening
at
all
humanity
was
enclosed
and
asleep
into
the
mouth
of
the
sober
kid
came
a
wretched
bitter
taste
as
if
it
had
filled
with
blood
he
was
transfixed
as
if
he
was
already
seeing
the
lightning
ripples
on
the
but
the
mexican
hand
did
not
move
at
that
time
his
face
went
still
further
forward
and
he
whispered
so
the
sober
kid
saw
this
face
as
if
he
and
it
were
alone
in
space
a
yellow
mask
smiling
in
eager
cruelty
in
satisfaction
and
above
all
it
was
lit
with
sinister
decision
as
for
the
features
they
were
reminiscent
of
an
unplaced
a
forgotten
type
which
really
resembled
with
precision
those
of
a
man
who
had
shaved
him
three
times
in
boston
in
but
the
expression
burned
his
mind
as
burns
the
palm
and
fascinated
stupefied
he
actually
watched
the
progress
of
the
man
thought
toward
the
point
where
a
knife
would
be
wrenched
from
its
sheath
the
emotion
a
sort
of
mechanical
fury
a
breeze
made
by
electric
fans
a
rage
made
by
vanity
smote
the
dark
countenance
in
wave
after
wave
then
the
new
york
kid
took
a
sudden
step
forward
his
hand
was
at
his
hip
he
was
gripping
there
a
revolver
of
robust
size
he
recalled
that
upon
its
black
handle
was
stamped
a
hunting
scene
in
which
a
sportsman
in
fine
leggings
and
a
peaked
cap
was
taking
aim
at
a
stag
less
than
of
an
inch
away
his
pace
forward
caused
instant
movement
of
the
mexicans
one
immediately
took
two
steps
to
face
him
squarely
there
was
a
general
adjustment
pair
and
pair
this
opponent
of
the
new
york
kid
was
a
tall
man
and
quite
stout
his
sombrero
was
drawn
low
over
his
eyes
his
serape
was
flung
on
his
left
shoulder
his
back
was
bended
in
the
supposed
manner
of
a
spanish
grandee
this
concave
gentleman
cut
a
fine
and
terrible
figure
the
lad
moved
by
the
spirits
of
his
modest
and
perpendicular
ancestors
had
time
to
feel
his
blood
roar
at
sight
of
the
pose
he
was
aware
that
the
third
mexican
was
over
on
the
left
fronting
benson
and
he
was
aware
that
benson
was
leaning
against
the
wall
sleepily
and
peacefully
eying
the
convention
so
it
happened
that
these
six
men
stood
side
fronting
side
five
of
them
with
their
right
hands
at
their
hips
and
with
their
bodies
lifted
nervously
while
the
central
pair
exchanged
a
crescendo
of
provocations
the
meaning
of
their
words
rose
and
rose
they
were
travelling
in
a
straight
line
toward
collision
the
new
york
kid
contemplated
his
spanish
grandee
he
drew
his
revolver
upward
until
the
hammer
was
surely
free
of
the
holster
he
waited
immovable
and
watchful
while
the
garrulous
frisco
kid
expended
two
and
a
half
lexicons
on
the
middle
mexican
the
eastern
lad
suddenly
decided
that
he
was
going
to
be
killed
his
mind
leaped
forward
and
studied
the
aftermath
the
story
would
be
a
marvel
of
brevity
when
first
it
reached
the
far
new
york
home
written
in
a
careful
hand
on
a
bit
of
cheap
paper
topped
and
footed
and
backed
by
the
printed
fortifications
of
the
cable
company
but
they
are
often
as
stones
flung
into
mirrors
these
bits
of
paper
upon
which
are
laconically
written
all
the
most
terrible
chronicles
of
the
times
he
witnessed
the
uprising
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
the
invincible
calm
of
his
old
father
who
would
probably
shut
himself
in
his
library
and
smoke
alone
then
his
father
would
come
and
they
would
bring
him
here
and
say
this
is
the
place
then
very
likely
each
would
remove
his
hat
they
would
stand
quietly
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
for
a
decent
minute
he
pitied
his
old
financing
father
unyielding
and
millioned
a
man
who
commonly
spoke
words
a
year
to
his
beloved
son
the
kid
understood
it
at
this
time
if
his
fate
was
not
impregnable
he
might
have
turned
out
to
be
a
man
and
have
been
liked
by
his
father
the
other
kid
would
mourn
his
death
he
would
be
preternaturally
correct
for
some
weeks
and
recite
the
tale
without
swearing
but
it
would
not
bore
him
for
the
sake
of
his
dead
comrade
he
would
be
glad
to
be
preternaturally
correct
and
to
recite
the
tale
without
swearing
these
views
were
perfectly
stereopticon
flashing
in
and
away
from
his
thought
with
an
inconceivable
rapidity
until
after
all
they
were
simply
one
quick
dismal
impression
and
now
here
is
the
unreal
real
into
this
kid
nostrils
at
the
expectant
moment
of
slaughter
had
come
the
scent
of
hay
a
fragrance
from
a
field
of
prostrate
grass
a
fragrance
which
contained
the
sunshine
the
bees
the
peace
of
meadows
and
the
wonder
of
a
distant
crooning
stream
it
had
no
right
to
be
supreme
but
it
was
supreme
and
he
breathed
it
as
he
waited
for
pain
and
a
sight
of
the
unknown
but
in
the
same
instant
it
may
be
his
thought
flew
to
the
frisco
kid
and
it
came
upon
him
like
a
flicker
of
lightning
that
the
frisco
kid
was
not
going
to
be
there
to
perform
for
instance
the
extraordinary
office
of
respectable
mourner
the
other
kid
head
was
muddled
his
hand
was
unsteady
his
agility
was
gone
this
other
kid
was
facing
the
determined
and
most
ferocious
gentleman
of
the
enemy
the
new
york
kid
became
convinced
that
his
friend
was
lost
there
was
going
to
be
a
screaming
murder
he
was
so
certain
of
it
that
he
wanted
to
shield
his
eyes
from
sight
of
the
leaping
arm
and
the
knife
it
was
sickening
utterly
sickening
the
new
york
kid
might
have
been
taking
his
first
a
combination
of
honourable
manhood
and
inability
prevented
him
from
running
away
he
suddenly
knew
that
it
was
possible
to
draw
his
own
revolver
and
by
a
swift
manoeuvre
face
down
all
three
mexicans
if
he
was
quick
enough
he
would
probably
be
victor
if
any
hitch
occurred
in
the
draw
he
would
undoubtedly
be
dead
with
his
friends
it
was
a
new
game
he
had
never
been
obliged
to
face
a
situation
of
this
kind
in
the
beacon
club
in
new
york
in
this
test
the
lungs
of
the
kid
still
continued
to
perform
their
duty
oh
five
white
mice
of
chance
shirts
of
wool
and
corduroy
pants
gold
and
wine
women
and
sin
all
for
you
if
you
let
me
come
in
into
the
house
of
chance
he
thought
of
the
weight
and
size
of
his
revolver
and
dismay
pierced
him
he
feared
that
in
his
hands
it
would
be
as
unwieldy
as
a
for
this
quick
work
he
imagined
too
that
some
singular
providence
might
cause
him
to
lose
his
grip
as
he
raised
his
weapon
or
it
might
get
fatally
entangled
in
the
tails
of
his
coat
some
of
the
eels
of
despair
lay
wet
and
cold
against
his
back
but
at
the
supreme
moment
the
revolver
came
forth
as
if
it
were
greased
and
it
arose
like
a
feather
this
somnolent
machine
after
months
of
repose
was
finally
looking
at
the
breasts
of
men
perhaps
in
this
one
series
of
movements
the
kid
had
unconsciously
used
nervous
force
sufficient
to
raise
a
bale
of
hay
before
he
comprehended
it
he
was
standing
behind
his
revolver
glaring
over
the
barrel
at
the
mexicans
menacing
first
one
and
then
another
his
finger
was
tremoring
on
the
trigger
the
revolver
gleamed
in
the
darkness
with
a
fine
silver
light
the
fulsome
grandee
sprang
backward
with
a
low
cry
the
man
who
had
been
facing
the
frisco
kid
took
a
quick
step
away
the
beautiful
array
of
mexicans
was
suddenly
disorganized
the
cry
and
the
backward
steps
revealed
something
of
great
importance
to
the
new
york
kid
he
had
never
dreamed
that
he
did
not
have
a
complete
monopoly
of
all
possible
trepidations
the
cry
of
the
grandee
was
that
of
a
man
who
suddenly
sees
a
poisonous
snake
thus
the
kid
was
able
to
understand
swiftly
that
they
were
all
human
beings
they
were
unanimous
in
not
wishing
for
too
bloody
combat
there
was
a
sudden
expression
of
the
equality
he
had
vaguely
believed
that
they
were
not
going
to
evince
much
consideration
for
his
dramatic
development
as
an
active
factor
they
even
might
be
exasperated
into
an
onslaught
by
it
instead
they
had
respected
his
movement
with
a
respect
as
great
even
as
an
ejaculation
of
fear
and
backward
steps
upon
the
instant
he
pounced
forward
and
began
to
swear
unreeling
great
english
oaths
as
thick
as
ropes
and
lashing
the
faces
of
the
mexicans
with
them
he
was
bursting
with
rage
because
these
men
had
not
previously
confided
to
him
that
they
were
vulnerable
the
whole
thing
had
been
an
absurd
imposition
he
had
been
seduced
into
respectful
alarm
by
the
concave
attitude
of
the
grandee
and
after
all
there
had
been
an
equality
of
emotion
an
equality
he
was
furious
he
wanted
to
take
the
serape
of
the
grandee
and
swaddle
him
in
it
the
mexicans
slunk
back
their
eyes
burning
wistfully
the
kid
took
aim
first
at
one
and
then
at
another
after
they
had
achieved
a
certain
distance
they
paused
and
drew
up
in
a
rank
they
then
resumed
some
of
their
old
splendour
of
manner
a
voice
hailed
him
in
a
tone
of
cynical
bravado
as
if
it
had
come
from
between
lips
of
smiling
mockery
well
se√±or
it
is
finished
the
kid
scowled
into
the
darkness
his
revolver
drooping
at
his
side
after
a
moment
he
answered
i
am
willing
he
found
it
strange
that
he
should
be
able
to
speak
after
this
silence
of
years
se√±or
when
he
turned
to
look
at
the
frisco
kid
he
found
him
in
his
original
position
his
hand
upon
his
hip
he
was
blinking
in
perplexity
at
the
point
from
whence
the
mexicans
had
vanished
well
said
the
sober
kid
crossly
are
you
ready
to
go
home
now
the
frisco
kid
said
where
they
gone
his
voice
was
undisturbed
but
inquisitive
benson
suddenly
propelled
himself
from
his
dreamful
position
against
the
wall
frishco
kid
all
right
he
drunk
fool
and
he
all
right
but
you
new
york
kid
you
shober
he
passed
into
a
state
of
profound
investigation
kid
shober
did
go
with
us
go
with
us
went
to
damn
circus
went
to
damn
circus
lose
shakin
dice
lose
shakin
dice
what
make
lose
shakin
dice
kid
the
new
york
kid
eyed
the
senile
youth
i
do
know
the
five
white
mice
maybe
benson
puzzled
so
over
this
reply
that
he
had
to
be
held
erect
by
his
friends
finally
the
frisco
kid
said
let
go
home
nothing
had
happened
flanagan
and
his
short
filibustering
adventure
i
i
have
got
twenty
men
at
me
back
who
will
fight
to
the
death
said
the
warrior
to
the
old
filibuster
and
they
can
be
blowed
for
all
me
replied
the
old
filibuster
common
as
sparrows
cheap
as
cigarettes
show
me
twenty
men
with
steel
clamps
on
their
mouths
with
holes
in
their
heads
where
memory
ought
to
be
and
i
want
but
twenty
brave
men
merely
i
rather
have
twenty
brave
onions
thereupon
the
warrior
removed
sadly
feeling
that
no
salaams
were
paid
to
valour
in
these
days
of
mechanical
excellence
valour
in
truth
is
no
bad
thing
to
have
when
filibustering
but
many
medals
are
to
be
won
by
the
man
who
knows
not
the
meaning
of
before
or
afterwards
twenty
brave
men
with
tongues
hung
lightly
may
make
trouble
rise
from
the
ground
like
smoke
from
grass
because
of
their
subsequent
fiery
pride
whereas
twenty
villains
who
accept
unrighteous
and
kicks
as
they
do
the
rain
from
heaven
may
halo
the
ultimate
history
of
an
expedition
with
gold
and
plentifully
bedeck
their
names
winning
forty
years
of
gratitude
from
patriots
simply
by
remaining
silent
as
for
the
cause
it
may
be
only
that
they
have
no
friends
or
other
credulous
furniture
if
it
were
not
for
the
curse
of
the
swinging
tongue
it
is
surely
to
be
said
that
the
filibustering
industry
flourishing
now
in
the
united
states
would
be
pie
under
correct
conditions
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
dealing
with
some
little
detectives
whose
skill
at
search
is
rated
by
those
who
pay
them
at
a
value
of
twelve
or
twenty
dollars
each
week
it
is
nearly
axiomatic
that
normally
a
twelve
dollar
per
week
detective
can
not
defeat
a
one
hundred
thousand
dollar
filibustering
excursion
against
the
criminal
the
detective
represents
the
commonwealth
but
in
this
other
case
he
represents
his
desire
to
show
cause
why
his
salary
should
be
paid
he
represents
himself
merely
and
he
counts
no
more
than
a
grocer
clerk
but
the
pride
of
the
successful
filibuster
often
smites
him
and
his
cause
like
an
axe
and
men
who
have
not
confided
in
their
mothers
go
prone
with
him
it
can
make
the
dome
of
the
capitol
tremble
and
incite
the
senators
to
benches
it
can
increase
the
salaries
of
detectives
who
could
not
detect
the
location
of
a
pain
in
the
chest
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
this
pride
filibustering
was
once
such
a
simple
game
it
was
managed
blandly
by
gentle
captains
and
smooth
and
undisturbed
gentlemen
who
at
other
times
dealt
in
law
soap
medicine
and
bananas
it
was
a
great
pity
that
the
little
cote
of
doves
in
washington
were
obliged
to
rustle
officially
and
naval
men
were
kept
from
their
berths
at
night
and
sundry
custom
house
people
got
wiggings
all
because
the
returned
adventurer
in
his
pride
a
yellow
and
red
banner
would
have
been
long
since
smothered
in
a
shame
of
defeat
if
a
contract
to
filibuster
had
been
let
to
some
admirable
organization
like
one
of
our
trusts
and
yet
the
game
is
not
obsolete
it
is
still
played
by
the
wise
and
the
silent
men
whose
names
are
not
and
blathered
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
there
is
in
mind
now
a
man
who
knew
one
side
of
a
fence
from
the
other
side
when
he
looked
sharply
they
were
hunting
for
captains
then
to
command
the
first
vessels
of
what
has
since
become
a
famous
little
fleet
one
was
recommended
to
this
man
and
he
said
send
him
down
to
my
office
and
i
look
him
over
he
was
an
attorney
and
he
liked
to
lean
back
in
his
chair
twirl
a
and
let
the
other
fellow
talk
the
man
came
and
stood
and
appeared
confounded
the
attorney
asked
the
terrible
first
question
of
the
filibuster
to
the
applicant
he
said
why
do
you
want
to
go
the
captain
reflected
changed
his
attitude
three
times
and
decided
ultimately
that
he
did
know
he
seemed
greatly
ashamed
the
attorney
looking
at
him
saw
that
he
had
eyes
that
resembled
a
lambkin
eyes
glory
said
the
attorney
at
last
said
the
captain
pay
not
that
so
much
think
they
give
you
a
land
grant
when
they
win
out
no
never
thought
no
glory
no
immense
pay
no
land
grant
what
are
you
going
for
then
well
i
do
know
said
the
captain
with
his
glance
on
the
floor
and
shifting
his
position
again
i
do
know
i
guess
it
just
for
fun
mostly
the
attorney
asked
him
out
to
have
a
drink
when
he
stood
on
the
bridge
of
his
steamer
the
attorney
saw
him
again
his
shore
meekness
and
uncertainty
were
gone
he
was
and
strong
aroused
like
a
mastiff
at
night
he
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
yelled
some
sudden
language
at
the
deck
this
steamer
had
about
her
a
quality
of
unholy
medi√¶val
disrepair
which
is
usually
accounted
the
principal
prerogative
of
the
united
states
revenue
marine
there
is
many
a
seaworthy
if
she
were
a
good
ship
she
swashed
through
the
seas
as
genially
as
an
old
wooden
clock
burying
her
head
under
waves
that
came
only
like
children
at
play
and
on
board
it
cost
a
ducking
to
go
from
anywhere
to
anywhere
the
captain
had
commanded
vessels
that
thought
were
liners
but
when
a
man
gets
the
ant
of
stirring
in
his
heart
he
will
wallow
out
to
sea
in
a
pail
the
thing
surpasses
a
man
love
for
his
sweetheart
the
great
had
long
been
flanagan
sweetheart
but
he
was
far
happier
off
hatteras
watching
this
wretched
little
portmanteau
boom
down
the
slant
of
a
wave
the
crew
scraped
acquaintance
one
with
another
gradually
each
man
came
ultimately
to
ask
his
neighbour
what
particular
turn
of
or
inherited
deviltry
caused
him
to
try
this
voyage
when
one
frank
bold
man
saw
another
frank
bold
man
aboard
he
smiled
and
they
became
friends
there
was
not
a
mind
on
board
the
ship
that
was
not
fastened
to
the
dangers
of
the
coast
of
cuba
and
taking
wonder
at
this
prospect
and
delight
in
it
still
in
jovial
moments
they
termed
each
other
accursed
idiots
at
first
there
was
some
trouble
in
the
where
there
were
many
steel
animals
for
the
most
part
painted
red
and
in
other
places
very
shiny
bewildering
complex
incomprehensible
to
any
one
who
care
usually
thumping
thumping
thumping
with
the
monotony
of
a
snore
it
seems
that
this
engine
was
as
whimsical
as
a
the
chief
engineer
was
a
fine
old
fellow
with
a
grey
moustache
but
the
engine
told
him
that
it
did
intend
to
budge
until
it
felt
better
he
came
to
the
bridge
and
said
the
blamed
old
thing
has
laid
down
on
us
sir
who
was
on
duty
roared
the
captain
the
second
sir
why
did
he
call
you
do
know
sir
later
the
stokers
had
occasion
to
thank
the
stars
that
they
were
not
second
engineers
the
was
soundly
thrashed
by
the
waves
for
loitering
while
the
captain
and
the
engineers
fought
the
obstinate
machinery
during
this
wait
on
the
sea
the
first
gloom
came
to
the
faces
of
the
company
the
ocean
is
wide
and
a
ship
is
a
small
place
for
the
feet
and
an
ill
ship
is
worriment
even
when
she
was
again
under
way
the
gloom
was
still
upon
the
crew
from
time
to
time
men
went
to
the
doors
and
looking
down
wanted
to
ask
questions
of
the
chief
engineer
who
slowly
prowled
to
and
fro
and
watched
with
careful
eye
his
mysteries
no
man
wished
to
have
a
companion
know
that
he
was
anxious
and
so
questions
were
caught
at
the
lips
perhaps
none
commented
save
the
first
mate
who
remarked
to
the
captain
wonder
what
the
bally
old
thing
will
do
sir
when
we
chased
by
a
spanish
cruiser
the
captain
merely
grinned
later
he
looked
over
the
side
and
said
to
himself
with
scorn
sixteen
knots
sixteen
knots
sixteen
hinges
on
the
inner
gates
of
hades
sixteen
knots
seven
is
her
gait
and
nine
if
you
crack
her
up
to
it
there
may
never
be
a
captain
whose
crew
ca
sniff
his
misgivings
they
scent
it
as
a
herd
scents
the
menace
far
through
the
trees
and
over
the
ridges
a
captain
that
does
not
know
that
he
is
on
a
foundering
ship
sometimes
can
take
his
men
to
tea
and
buttered
toast
twelve
minutes
before
the
disaster
but
let
him
fret
for
a
moment
in
the
loneliness
of
his
cabin
and
in
no
time
it
affects
the
liver
of
a
distant
and
sensitive
seaman
even
as
flanagan
reflected
on
the
viewing
her
as
a
filibuster
word
arrived
that
a
winter
of
discontent
had
come
to
the
the
captain
knew
that
it
requires
sky
to
give
a
man
courage
he
sent
for
a
stoker
and
talked
to
him
on
the
bridge
the
man
standing
under
the
sky
instantly
and
shamefacedly
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
business
nevertheless
a
jaw
had
presently
to
be
broken
by
a
fist
because
the
could
only
steam
nine
knots
and
because
the
has
no
sky
no
wind
no
bright
horizon
when
the
was
somewhere
off
savannah
a
blow
came
from
the
and
the
steamer
headed
rolled
like
a
boiling
potato
the
first
mate
was
a
fine
officer
and
so
a
wave
crashed
him
into
the
and
broke
his
arm
the
cook
was
a
good
cook
and
so
the
heave
of
the
ship
flung
him
heels
over
head
with
a
pot
of
boiling
water
and
caused
him
to
lose
interest
in
everything
save
his
legs
by
the
piper
said
flanagan
to
himself
this
filibustering
is
no
trick
with
cards
later
there
was
more
trouble
in
the
all
the
stokers
participated
save
the
one
with
a
broken
jaw
who
had
become
discouraged
the
captain
had
an
excellent
chest
development
when
he
went
aft
roaring
it
was
plain
that
a
man
could
beat
carpets
with
a
voice
like
that
one
ii
one
night
the
was
off
the
southern
coast
of
florida
and
running
at
towards
the
shore
the
captain
was
on
the
bridge
four
flashes
at
intervals
of
one
minute
he
said
to
himself
gazing
steadfastly
towards
the
beach
suddenly
a
yellow
eye
opened
in
the
black
face
of
the
night
and
looked
at
the
and
closed
again
the
captain
studied
his
watch
and
the
shore
three
times
more
the
eye
opened
and
looked
at
the
and
closed
again
the
captain
called
to
the
vague
figures
on
the
deck
below
him
answer
it
the
flash
of
a
light
from
the
bow
of
the
steamer
displayed
for
a
moment
in
golden
colour
the
crests
of
the
inriding
waves
the
lay
to
and
waited
the
long
swells
rolled
her
gracefully
and
her
two
stub
masts
reaching
into
the
darkness
swung
with
the
solemnity
of
batons
timing
a
dirge
when
the
ship
had
left
boston
she
had
been
as
encrusted
with
ice
as
a
dakota
beard
but
now
the
gentle
wind
of
florida
softly
swayed
the
lock
on
the
forehead
of
the
coatless
flanagan
and
he
lit
a
new
cigar
without
troubling
to
make
a
shield
of
his
hands
finally
a
dark
boat
came
plashing
over
the
waves
as
it
came
very
near
the
captain
leaned
forward
and
perceived
that
the
men
in
her
rowed
like
seamstresses
and
at
the
same
time
a
voice
hailed
him
in
bad
english
it
a
dead
sure
connection
said
he
to
himself
at
sea
to
load
two
hundred
thousand
rounds
of
rifle
ammunition
seven
hundred
and
fifty
rifles
two
field
guns
with
a
hundred
shells
forty
bundles
of
machetes
and
a
hundred
pounds
of
dynamite
from
yawls
and
by
men
who
are
not
born
stevedores
and
in
a
heavy
ground
swell
and
with
the
searchlight
of
a
united
states
cruiser
sometimes
flashing
like
lightning
in
the
sky
to
the
southward
is
no
business
for
a
class
when
at
last
the
was
steaming
for
the
open
over
the
grey
sea
at
dawn
there
was
not
a
man
of
the
forty
come
aboard
from
the
florida
shore
nor
of
the
fifteen
sailed
from
boston
who
was
not
glad
standing
with
his
hair
matted
to
his
forehead
with
sweat
smiling
at
the
broad
wake
of
the
and
the
dim
streak
on
the
horizon
which
was
florida
but
there
is
a
point
of
the
compass
in
these
waters
men
call
the
when
the
strong
winds
come
from
that
direction
they
kick
up
a
turmoil
that
is
not
good
for
a
stuffed
with
coals
and
in
the
gale
which
came
this
ship
was
no
more
than
a
drunken
soldier
the
cuban
leader
standing
on
the
bridge
with
the
captain
was
presently
informed
that
of
his
men
out
of
a
possible
were
and
in
truth
they
were
there
are
degrees
in
this
complaint
but
that
matter
was
waived
between
them
they
were
all
sick
to
the
limits
they
strewed
the
deck
in
every
posture
of
human
anguish
and
when
the
ducked
and
water
came
sluicing
down
from
the
bows
they
let
it
sluice
they
were
satisfied
if
they
could
keep
their
heads
clear
of
the
wash
and
if
they
could
not
keep
their
heads
clear
of
the
wash
they
did
care
presently
the
swung
her
course
to
the
and
the
waves
pounded
her
broadside
the
patriots
were
all
ordered
below
decks
and
there
they
howled
and
measured
their
misery
one
against
another
all
day
the
plopped
and
floundered
over
a
blazing
bright
meadow
of
an
ocean
whereon
the
white
foam
was
like
flowers
the
captain
on
the
bridge
mused
and
studied
the
bare
horizon
hell
said
he
to
himself
and
the
word
was
more
in
amazement
than
in
indignation
or
sorrow
passengers
the
mate
with
a
broken
arm
a
stoker
with
a
broken
jaw
the
cook
with
a
pair
of
scalded
legs
and
an
engine
likely
to
be
taken
with
all
these
diseases
if
not
more
if
i
get
back
to
a
home
port
with
a
spoke
of
the
wheel
gripped
in
my
hands
it
be
fair
luck
there
is
a
kind
of
bred
in
florida
which
the
natives
declare
is
potent
in
the
proportion
of
seven
fights
to
a
drink
some
of
the
cuban
volunteers
had
had
the
forethought
to
bring
a
small
quantity
of
this
whisky
aboard
with
them
and
being
now
in
the
and
feeling
that
they
would
not
care
to
drink
liquor
for
two
or
three
years
to
come
they
gracefully
tendered
their
portions
to
the
stokers
the
stokers
accepted
these
gifts
without
avidity
but
with
a
certain
earnestness
of
manner
as
they
were
stokers
and
toiling
the
whirl
of
emotion
was
delayed
but
it
arrived
ultimately
and
with
emphasis
one
stoker
called
another
stoker
a
weird
name
and
the
latter
righteously
inflamed
at
it
smote
his
mate
with
an
iron
shovel
and
the
man
fell
headlong
over
a
heap
of
coal
which
crashed
gently
while
piece
after
piece
rattled
down
upon
the
deck
a
third
stoker
was
providently
enraged
at
the
scene
and
assailed
the
second
stoker
they
fought
for
some
moments
while
the
cubans
sprawled
on
the
deck
watched
with
languid
rolling
glances
the
ferocity
of
this
scuffle
one
was
so
indifferent
to
the
strategic
importance
of
the
space
he
occupied
that
he
was
kicked
on
the
shins
when
the
second
engineer
came
to
separating
the
combatants
he
was
sincere
in
his
efforts
and
he
came
near
to
disabling
them
for
life
the
captain
said
i
go
down
there
and
but
the
leader
of
the
cubans
restrained
him
no
no
he
cried
you
must
not
we
must
treat
them
like
children
very
gently
all
the
time
you
see
or
else
when
we
get
back
to
a
united
states
port
they
will
what
you
call
spring
yes
spring
the
whole
business
we
must
jolly
them
you
see
you
mean
said
the
captain
thoughtfully
they
are
likely
to
get
mad
and
give
the
expedition
dead
away
when
we
reach
port
again
unless
we
blarney
them
now
yes
yes
cried
the
cuban
leader
unless
we
are
so
very
gentle
with
them
they
will
make
many
troubles
afterwards
for
us
in
the
newspapers
and
then
in
court
well
but
i
wo
have
my
crew
began
the
captain
but
you
must
interrupted
the
cuban
you
must
it
is
the
only
thing
you
are
like
the
captain
of
a
pirate
ship
you
see
only
you
throw
them
overboard
like
him
you
see
hum
said
the
captain
this
here
filibustering
business
has
got
a
lot
to
it
when
you
come
to
look
it
over
he
called
the
fighting
stokers
to
the
bridge
and
the
three
came
meek
and
considerably
battered
he
was
lecturing
them
soundly
but
sensibly
when
he
suddenly
tripped
a
sentence
and
cried
here
where
that
other
fellow
how
does
it
come
he
was
in
the
fight
the
row
of
stokers
cried
at
once
eagerly
he
hurt
sir
he
got
a
broken
jaw
sir
so
he
has
so
he
has
murmured
the
captain
much
embarrassed
and
because
of
all
these
affairs
the
steamed
toward
cuba
with
its
crew
in
a
sling
if
one
may
be
allowed
to
speak
in
that
way
iii
at
night
the
approached
the
coast
like
a
thief
her
lights
were
muffled
so
that
from
the
deck
the
sea
shone
with
its
own
radiance
like
the
faint
shimmer
of
some
kinds
of
silk
the
men
on
deck
spoke
in
whispers
and
even
down
in
the
the
hidden
stokers
working
before
the
furnace
doors
used
no
words
and
walked
on
the
stars
were
out
in
the
sky
and
their
light
with
the
soft
shine
of
the
sea
caused
the
coast
to
appear
black
as
the
side
of
a
coffin
the
surf
boomed
in
low
thunder
on
the
distant
beach
the
engines
ceased
their
thumping
for
a
time
she
glided
quietly
forward
until
a
bell
chimed
faintly
in
the
then
she
paused
with
a
flourish
of
phosphorescent
waters
give
the
signal
said
the
captain
three
times
a
flash
of
light
went
from
the
bow
there
was
a
moment
of
waiting
then
an
eye
like
the
one
on
the
coast
of
florida
opened
and
closed
opened
and
closed
opened
and
closed
the
cubans
grouped
in
a
great
shadow
on
deck
burst
into
a
low
chatter
of
delight
a
hiss
from
their
leader
silenced
them
well
said
the
captain
all
right
said
the
leader
at
the
giving
of
the
word
it
was
not
apparent
that
any
one
on
board
of
the
had
ever
been
the
boats
were
lowered
swiftly
too
swiftly
boxes
of
cartridges
were
dragged
from
the
hold
and
passed
over
the
side
with
a
rapidity
that
made
men
in
the
boats
exclaim
against
it
they
were
being
bombarded
when
a
boat
headed
for
shore
its
rowers
pulled
like
madmen
the
captain
paced
slowly
to
and
fro
on
the
bridge
in
the
the
engineers
stood
at
their
station
and
in
the
the
firemen
fidgeted
silently
around
the
furnace
doors
on
the
bridge
flanagan
reflected
oh
i
do
know
he
observed
this
filibustering
business
is
so
bad
pretty
soon
it
be
off
to
sea
again
with
nothing
to
do
but
some
big
lying
when
i
get
into
port
in
one
of
the
boats
returning
from
shore
came
twelve
cuban
officers
the
greater
number
of
them
convalescing
from
wounds
while
two
or
three
of
them
had
been
ordered
to
america
on
commissions
from
the
insurgents
the
captain
welcomed
them
and
assured
them
of
a
speedy
and
safe
voyage
presently
he
went
again
to
the
bridge
and
scanned
the
horizon
the
sea
was
lonely
like
the
spaces
amid
the
suns
the
captain
grinned
and
softly
smote
his
chest
it
dead
easy
he
said
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
cargo
and
the
men
were
breathing
like
spent
horses
although
their
elation
grew
with
each
moment
when
suddenly
a
voice
spoke
from
the
sky
it
was
not
a
loud
voice
but
the
quality
of
it
brought
every
man
on
deck
to
full
stop
and
motionless
as
if
they
had
all
been
changed
to
wax
captain
said
the
man
at
the
masthead
there
a
light
to
the
sir
think
it
a
steamer
sir
there
was
a
still
moment
until
the
captain
called
well
keep
your
eye
on
it
now
speaking
to
the
deck
he
said
go
ahead
with
your
unloading
the
second
engineer
went
to
the
galley
to
borrow
a
tin
cup
hear
the
news
second
asked
the
cook
steamer
coming
up
from
the
gee
said
the
second
engineer
in
the
he
said
to
the
chief
steamer
coming
up
from
the
sir
the
chief
engineer
began
to
test
various
little
machines
with
which
his
domain
was
decorated
finally
he
addressed
the
boys
i
want
you
to
look
sharp
now
there
a
steamer
coming
up
to
the
all
right
sir
said
the
from
time
to
time
the
captain
hailed
the
masthead
how
is
she
now
seems
to
be
coming
down
on
us
pretty
fast
sir
the
cuban
leader
came
anxiously
to
the
captain
do
you
think
we
can
save
all
the
cargo
it
is
rather
delicate
business
no
go
ahead
said
flanagan
fire
away
i
wait
there
continued
the
hurried
shuffling
of
feet
on
deck
and
the
low
cries
of
the
men
unloading
the
cargo
in
the
the
chief
and
his
assistant
were
staring
at
the
gong
in
the
the
firemen
breathed
through
their
teeth
a
shovel
slipped
from
where
it
leaned
against
the
side
and
banged
on
the
floor
the
stokers
started
and
looked
around
quickly
climbing
to
the
rail
and
holding
on
to
a
stay
the
captain
gazed
westward
a
light
had
raised
out
of
the
deep
after
watching
this
light
for
a
time
he
called
to
the
cuban
leader
well
as
soon
as
ready
now
we
might
as
well
be
skipping
out
finally
the
cuban
leader
told
him
well
this
is
the
last
load
as
soon
as
the
boats
come
back
you
can
be
off
sha
wait
for
all
the
boats
said
the
captain
that
fellow
is
too
close
as
the
second
boat
came
aboard
the
turned
and
like
a
black
shadow
stole
seaward
to
cross
the
bows
of
the
oncoming
steamer
waited
about
ten
minutes
too
long
said
the
captain
to
himself
suddenly
the
light
in
the
west
vanished
hum
said
flanagan
up
to
some
meanness
every
one
outside
of
the
was
set
on
watch
the
going
at
full
speed
into
the
slashed
a
wonderful
trail
of
blue
silver
on
the
dark
bosom
of
the
sea
a
man
on
deck
cried
out
hurriedly
there
she
is
sir
many
eyes
searched
the
western
gloom
and
one
after
another
the
glances
of
the
men
found
a
tiny
shadow
on
the
deep
with
a
line
of
white
beneath
it
he
could
be
heading
better
if
he
had
a
line
to
us
said
flanagan
there
was
a
thin
flash
of
red
in
the
darkness
it
was
long
and
keen
like
a
crimson
rapier
a
short
sharp
report
sounded
and
then
a
shot
whined
swiftly
in
the
air
and
blipped
into
the
sea
the
captain
had
been
about
to
take
a
bite
of
plug
tobacco
at
the
beginning
of
this
incident
and
his
arm
was
raised
he
remained
like
a
frozen
figure
while
the
shot
whined
and
then
as
it
blipped
into
the
sea
his
hand
went
to
his
mouth
and
he
bit
the
plug
he
looked
at
the
shadow
with
its
line
of
white
the
senior
cuban
officer
came
hurriedly
to
the
bridge
it
is
no
good
to
surrender
he
cried
they
would
only
shoot
or
hang
all
of
us
there
was
another
thin
red
flash
and
a
report
a
loud
whirring
noise
passed
over
the
ship
i
not
going
to
surrender
said
the
captain
hanging
with
both
hands
to
the
rail
he
appeared
like
a
man
whose
traditions
of
peace
are
clinched
in
his
heart
he
was
as
astonished
as
if
his
hat
had
turned
into
a
dog
presently
he
wheeled
quickly
and
said
what
kind
of
a
gun
is
that
it
is
a
cried
the
cuban
officer
the
boat
is
one
of
those
little
gunboats
made
from
a
yacht
you
see
well
if
it
only
a
yawl
he
sink
us
in
five
more
minutes
said
flanagan
for
a
moment
he
looked
helplessly
off
at
the
horizon
his
hung
low
but
a
moment
later
something
touched
him
like
a
stiletto
point
of
inspiration
he
leaped
to
the
pilothouse
and
roared
at
the
man
at
the
wheel
the
sheered
suddenly
to
starboard
made
a
clumsy
turn
and
flanagan
was
bellowing
through
the
tube
to
the
before
everybody
discovered
that
the
old
basket
was
heading
straight
for
the
spanish
the
ship
lunged
forward
like
a
on
the
gallop
this
strange
manoeuvre
by
the
first
dealt
consternation
on
board
of
the
men
instinctively
crouched
on
the
instant
and
then
swore
their
supreme
oath
which
was
unheard
by
their
own
ears
later
the
manoeuvre
of
the
dealt
consternation
on
board
of
the
gunboat
she
had
been
going
victoriously
forward
from
the
fury
of
her
pursuit
then
this
tall
threatening
shape
had
suddenly
loomed
over
her
like
a
giant
apparition
the
people
on
board
the
heard
panic
shouts
hoarse
orders
the
little
gunboat
was
paralyzed
with
astonishment
suddenly
flanagan
yelled
with
rage
and
sprang
for
the
wheel
the
helmsman
had
turned
his
eyes
away
as
the
captain
whirled
the
wheel
far
to
starboard
he
heard
a
crunch
as
the
lifted
on
a
wave
smashed
her
shoulder
against
the
gunboat
and
he
saw
shooting
past
a
little
launch
sort
of
a
thing
with
men
on
her
that
ran
this
way
and
that
way
the
cuban
officers
joined
by
the
cook
and
a
seaman
emptied
their
revolvers
into
the
surprised
terror
of
the
seas
there
was
naturally
no
pursuit
under
comfortable
speed
the
stood
to
the
northwards
the
captain
went
to
his
berth
chuckling
there
by
god
he
said
there
now
iv
when
flanagan
came
again
on
deck
the
first
mate
his
arm
in
a
sling
walked
the
bridge
flanagan
was
smiling
a
wide
smile
the
bridge
of
the
was
dipping
afar
and
then
afar
with
each
lunge
of
the
little
steamer
the
water
seethed
and
boomed
alongside
and
the
spray
dashed
high
and
swiftly
well
said
flanagan
inflating
himself
we
had
a
great
deal
of
a
time
and
we
come
through
it
all
right
and
thank
heaven
it
is
all
over
the
sky
in
the
was
of
a
dull
in
tone
shaded
here
and
there
by
black
masses
that
billowed
out
in
some
fashion
from
the
flat
heavens
look
there
said
the
mate
hum
said
the
captain
looks
like
a
blow
do
it
later
the
surface
of
the
water
rippled
and
flickered
in
the
preliminary
wind
the
sea
had
become
the
colour
of
lead
the
swashing
sound
of
the
waves
on
the
sides
of
the
was
now
provided
with
some
manner
of
ominous
significance
the
men
shouts
were
hoarse
a
squall
struck
the
on
her
starboard
quarter
and
she
leaned
under
the
force
of
it
as
if
she
were
never
to
return
to
the
even
keel
i
be
glad
when
we
get
in
said
the
mate
i
going
to
quit
then
i
got
enough
hell
said
the
beaming
flanagan
the
steamer
crawled
on
into
the
the
white
water
sweeping
out
from
her
deadened
the
of
the
tired
old
engines
once
when
the
boat
careened
she
laid
her
shoulder
flat
on
the
sea
and
rested
in
that
manner
the
mate
looking
down
the
bridge
which
slanted
more
than
a
whistled
softly
to
himself
slowly
heavily
the
arose
to
meet
another
sea
at
night
waves
thundered
mightily
on
the
bows
of
the
steamer
and
water
lit
with
the
beautiful
phosphorescent
glamour
went
boiling
and
howling
along
deck
by
good
fortune
the
chief
engineer
crawled
safely
but
utterly
drenched
to
the
galley
for
coffee
well
how
goes
it
chief
said
the
cook
standing
with
his
fat
arms
folded
in
order
to
prove
that
he
could
balance
himself
under
any
conditions
the
engineer
shook
his
head
dejectedly
this
old
will
never
see
port
again
why
she
fall
to
pieces
finally
at
night
the
captain
said
launch
the
boats
the
cubans
hovered
about
him
is
the
ship
going
to
sink
the
captain
addressed
them
politely
gentlemen
we
are
in
trouble
but
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
you
just
do
what
i
tell
you
and
no
harm
will
come
to
anybody
the
mate
directed
the
lowering
of
the
first
boat
and
the
men
performed
this
task
with
all
decency
like
people
at
the
side
of
a
grave
a
young
oiler
came
to
the
captain
the
chief
sends
word
sir
that
the
water
is
almost
up
to
the
fires
keep
at
it
as
long
as
you
can
keep
at
it
as
long
as
we
can
sir
flanagan
took
the
senior
cuban
officer
to
the
rail
and
as
the
steamer
sheered
high
on
a
great
sea
showed
him
a
yellow
dot
on
the
horizon
it
was
smaller
than
a
needle
when
its
point
is
towards
you
there
said
the
captain
the
spray
was
lashing
his
face
that
jupiter
light
on
the
florida
coast
put
your
men
in
the
boat
we
just
launched
and
the
mate
will
take
you
to
that
light
afterwards
flanagan
turned
to
the
chief
engineer
we
can
never
beach
said
the
old
man
the
stokers
have
got
to
quit
in
a
minute
tears
were
in
his
eyes
the
was
a
wounded
thing
she
lay
on
the
water
with
gasping
engines
and
each
wave
resembled
her
now
the
way
of
a
good
ship
on
the
sea
is
finer
than
but
this
is
when
she
is
alive
if
a
time
comes
that
the
ship
dies
then
her
way
is
the
way
of
a
floating
old
glove
and
she
has
that
much
vim
spirit
buoyancy
at
this
time
many
men
on
the
suddenly
came
to
know
that
they
were
clinging
to
a
corpse
the
captain
went
to
the
and
what
he
saw
as
he
swung
down
the
companion
suddenly
turned
him
hesitant
and
dumb
water
was
swirling
to
and
fro
with
the
roll
of
the
ship
fuming
greasily
around
machinery
that
still
attempted
to
perform
its
duty
steam
arose
from
the
water
and
through
its
clouds
shone
the
red
glare
of
the
dying
fires
as
for
the
stokers
death
might
have
been
with
silence
in
this
room
one
lay
in
his
berth
his
hands
under
his
head
staring
moodily
at
the
wall
one
sat
near
the
foot
of
the
companion
his
face
hidden
in
his
arms
one
leaned
against
the
side
and
gazed
at
the
snarling
water
as
it
rose
and
its
mad
eddies
among
the
machinery
in
the
unholy
red
light
and
grey
mist
of
this
stifling
dim
inferno
they
were
strange
figures
with
their
silence
and
their
immobility
the
wretched
groaned
deeply
as
she
lifted
and
groaned
deeply
as
she
sank
into
the
trough
while
hurried
waves
then
thundered
over
her
with
the
noise
of
landslides
the
terrified
machinery
was
making
gestures
but
flanagan
took
control
of
himself
suddenly
then
he
stirred
the
the
stillness
had
been
so
unearthly
that
he
was
not
altogether
inapprehensive
of
strange
and
grim
deeds
when
he
charged
into
them
but
precisely
as
they
had
submitted
to
the
sea
so
they
submitted
to
flanagan
for
a
moment
they
rolled
their
eyes
like
hurt
cows
but
they
obeyed
the
voice
the
situation
simply
required
a
voice
when
the
captain
returned
to
the
deck
the
hue
of
this
was
in
his
mind
and
then
he
understood
doom
and
its
weight
and
complexion
when
finally
the
sank
she
shifted
and
settled
as
calmly
as
an
animal
curls
down
in
the
bush
grass
away
over
the
waves
two
bobbing
boats
paused
to
witness
this
quiet
death
it
was
a
slow
manoeuvre
altogether
without
the
pageantry
of
uproar
but
it
flashed
pallor
into
the
faces
of
all
men
who
saw
it
and
they
groaned
when
they
said
there
she
goes
suddenly
the
captain
whirled
and
knocked
his
hand
on
the
gunwale
he
sobbed
for
a
time
and
then
he
sobbed
and
swore
also
there
was
a
dance
at
the
imperial
inn
during
the
evening
some
irresponsible
young
men
came
from
the
beach
bringing
the
statement
that
several
boatloads
of
people
had
been
perceived
off
shore
it
was
a
charming
dance
and
none
cared
to
take
time
to
believe
this
tale
the
fountain
in
the
splashed
softly
and
couple
after
couple
paraded
through
the
aisles
of
palms
where
lamps
with
red
shades
threw
a
rose
light
upon
the
gleaming
leaves
the
band
played
its
waltzes
slumberously
and
its
music
came
faintly
to
the
people
among
the
palms
sometimes
a
woman
said
oh
it
is
not
really
true
is
it
that
there
was
a
wreck
out
at
sea
a
man
usually
said
no
of
course
not
at
last
however
a
youth
came
violently
from
the
beach
he
was
triumphant
in
manner
they
out
there
he
cried
a
whole
he
received
eager
attention
and
he
told
all
that
he
supposed
his
news
destroyed
the
dance
after
a
time
the
band
was
playing
beautifully
to
space
the
guests
had
hurried
to
the
beach
one
little
girl
cried
oh
mamma
may
i
go
too
being
refused
permission
she
pouted
as
they
came
from
the
shelter
of
the
great
hotel
the
wind
was
blowing
swiftly
from
the
sea
and
at
intervals
a
breaker
shone
livid
the
women
shuddered
and
their
bending
companions
seized
the
opportunity
to
draw
the
cloaks
closer
oh
dear
said
a
girl
supposin
they
were
out
there
drowning
while
we
were
dancing
oh
nonsense
said
her
younger
brother
that
do
happen
well
it
might
you
know
roger
how
can
you
tell
a
man
who
was
not
her
brother
gazed
at
her
then
with
profound
admiration
later
she
complained
of
the
damp
sand
and
drawing
back
her
skirts
looked
ruefully
at
her
little
feet
a
mother
son
was
venturing
too
near
to
the
water
in
his
interest
and
excitement
occasionally
she
cautioned
and
reproached
him
from
the
background
save
for
the
white
glare
of
the
breakers
the
sea
was
a
great
void
from
the
throng
of
charming
women
floated
the
perfume
of
many
flowers
later
there
floated
to
them
a
body
with
a
calm
face
of
an
irish
type
the
expedition
of
the
will
never
be
historic
horses
richardson
pulled
up
his
horse
and
looked
back
over
the
trail
where
the
crimson
serape
of
his
servant
flamed
amid
the
dusk
of
the
mesquit
the
hills
in
the
west
were
carved
into
peaks
and
were
painted
the
most
profound
blue
above
them
the
sky
was
of
that
marvellous
tone
of
green
like
still
water
which
people
denounce
in
pictures
jos√©
was
muffled
deep
in
his
blanket
and
his
great
toppling
sombrero
was
drawn
low
over
his
brow
he
shadowed
his
master
along
the
dimming
trail
in
the
fashion
of
an
assassin
a
cold
wind
of
the
impending
night
swept
over
the
wilderness
of
mesquit
man
said
richardson
in
lame
mexican
as
the
servant
drew
near
i
want
eat
i
want
sleep
understand
no
quickly
understand
si
se√±or
said
jos√©
nodding
he
stretched
one
arm
out
of
his
blanket
and
pointed
a
yellow
finger
into
the
gloom
over
there
small
village
si
se√±or
they
rode
forward
again
once
the
american
horse
shied
and
breathed
quiveringly
at
something
which
he
saw
or
imagined
in
the
darkness
and
the
rider
drew
a
steady
patient
rein
and
leaned
over
to
speak
tenderly
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
frightened
woman
the
sky
had
faded
to
white
over
the
mountains
and
the
plain
was
a
vast
pointless
ocean
of
black
suddenly
some
low
houses
appeared
squatting
amid
the
bushes
the
horsemen
rode
into
a
hollow
until
the
houses
rose
against
the
sombre
sundown
sky
and
then
up
a
small
hillock
causing
these
habitations
to
sink
like
boats
in
the
sea
of
shadow
a
beam
of
red
firelight
fell
across
the
trail
richardson
sat
sleepily
on
his
horse
while
his
servant
quarrelled
with
somebody
a
mere
voice
in
the
gloom
over
the
price
of
bed
and
board
the
houses
about
him
were
for
the
most
part
like
tombs
in
their
whiteness
and
silence
but
there
were
scudding
black
figures
that
seemed
interested
in
his
arrival
jos√©
came
at
last
to
the
horses
heads
and
the
american
slid
stiffly
from
his
seat
he
muttered
a
greeting
as
with
his
spurred
feet
he
clicked
into
the
adobe
house
that
confronted
him
the
brown
stolid
face
of
a
woman
shone
in
the
light
of
the
fire
he
seated
himself
on
the
earthen
floor
and
blinked
drowsily
at
the
blaze
he
was
aware
that
the
woman
was
clinking
earthenware
and
hieing
here
and
everywhere
in
the
manoeuvres
of
the
housewife
from
a
dark
corner
there
came
the
sound
of
two
or
three
snores
twining
together
the
woman
handed
him
a
bowl
of
tortillas
she
was
a
submissive
creature
timid
and
she
gazed
at
his
enormous
silver
spurs
his
large
and
impressive
revolver
with
the
interest
and
admiration
of
the
cat
of
the
adage
when
he
ate
she
seemed
transfixed
off
there
in
the
gloom
her
white
teeth
shining
jos√©
entered
staggering
under
two
mexican
saddles
large
enough
for
richardson
decided
to
smoke
a
cigarette
and
then
changed
his
mind
it
would
be
much
finer
to
go
to
sleep
his
blanket
hung
over
his
left
shoulder
furled
into
a
long
pipe
of
cloth
according
to
the
mexican
fashion
by
doffing
his
sombrero
unfastening
his
spurs
and
his
revolver
belt
he
made
himself
ready
for
the
slow
blissful
twist
into
the
blanket
like
a
cautious
man
he
lay
close
to
the
wall
and
all
his
property
was
very
near
his
hand
the
mesquit
brush
burned
long
jos√©
threw
two
gigantic
wings
of
shadow
as
he
flapped
his
blanket
about
him
first
across
his
chest
under
his
arms
and
then
around
his
neck
and
across
his
chest
again
this
time
over
his
arms
with
the
end
tossed
on
his
right
shoulder
a
mexican
thus
snugly
enveloped
can
nevertheless
free
his
fighting
arm
in
a
beautifully
brisk
way
merely
shrugging
his
shoulder
as
he
grabs
for
the
weapon
at
his
belt
they
always
wear
their
serapes
in
this
manner
the
firelight
smothered
the
rays
which
streaming
from
a
moon
as
large
as
a
were
struggling
at
the
open
door
richardson
heard
from
the
plain
the
fine
rhythmical
trample
of
the
hoofs
of
hurried
horses
he
went
to
sleep
wondering
who
rode
so
fast
and
so
late
and
in
the
deep
silence
the
pale
rays
of
the
moon
must
have
prevailed
against
the
red
spears
of
the
fire
until
the
room
was
slowly
flooded
to
its
middle
with
a
rectangle
of
silver
light
richardson
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
guitar
it
was
badly
played
in
this
land
of
mexico
from
which
the
romance
of
the
instrument
ascends
to
us
like
a
perfume
the
guitar
was
groaning
and
whining
like
a
badgered
soul
a
noise
of
scuffling
feet
accompanied
the
music
sometimes
laughter
arose
and
often
the
voices
of
men
saying
bitter
things
to
each
other
but
always
the
guitar
cried
on
the
treble
sounding
as
if
some
one
were
beating
iron
and
the
bass
humming
like
bees
damn
it
they
having
a
dance
he
muttered
fretfully
he
heard
two
men
quarrelling
in
short
sharp
words
like
pistol
shots
they
were
calling
each
other
worse
names
than
common
people
know
in
other
countries
he
wondered
why
the
noise
was
so
loud
raising
his
head
from
his
saddle
pillow
he
saw
with
the
help
of
the
valiant
moonbeams
a
blanket
hanging
flat
against
the
wall
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
being
of
opinion
that
it
concealed
a
door
and
remembering
that
mexican
drink
made
men
very
drunk
he
pulled
his
revolver
closer
to
him
and
prepared
for
sudden
disaster
richardson
was
dreaming
of
his
far
and
beloved
north
well
i
would
kill
him
then
no
you
must
not
yes
i
will
kill
him
listen
i
will
ask
this
american
beast
for
his
beautiful
pistol
and
spurs
and
money
and
saddle
and
if
he
will
not
give
them
you
will
see
but
these
americans
they
are
a
strange
people
look
out
se√±or
then
twenty
voices
took
part
in
the
discussion
they
rose
in
quavering
shrillness
as
from
men
badly
drunk
richardson
felt
the
skin
draw
tight
around
his
mouth
and
his
turned
to
bread
he
slowly
came
to
a
sitting
posture
glaring
at
the
motionless
blanket
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
this
stiff
and
mechanical
movement
accomplished
entirely
by
the
muscles
of
the
waist
must
have
looked
like
the
rising
of
a
corpse
in
the
wan
moonlight
which
gave
everything
a
hue
of
the
grave
my
friend
take
my
advice
and
never
be
executed
by
a
hangman
who
does
talk
the
english
language
it
or
anything
that
resembles
it
is
the
most
difficult
of
deaths
the
tumultuous
emotions
of
richardson
terror
destroyed
that
slow
and
careful
process
of
thought
by
means
of
which
he
understood
mexican
then
he
used
his
instinctive
comprehension
of
the
first
and
universal
language
which
is
tone
still
it
is
disheartening
not
to
be
able
to
understand
the
detail
of
threats
against
the
blood
of
your
body
suddenly
the
clamour
of
voices
ceased
there
was
a
silence
a
silence
of
decision
the
blanket
was
flung
aside
and
the
red
light
of
a
torch
flared
into
the
room
it
was
held
high
by
a
fat
mexican
whose
little
moustache
was
as
black
as
his
eyes
and
whose
eyes
were
black
as
jet
he
was
insane
with
the
wild
rage
of
a
man
whose
liquor
is
dully
burning
at
his
brain
five
or
six
of
his
fellows
crowded
after
him
the
guitar
which
had
been
thrummed
doggedly
during
the
time
of
the
high
words
now
suddenly
stopped
they
contemplated
each
other
richardson
sat
very
straight
and
still
his
right
hand
lost
in
his
blanket
the
mexicans
jostled
in
the
light
of
the
torch
their
eyes
blinking
and
glittering
the
fat
one
posed
in
the
manner
of
a
grandee
presently
his
hand
dropped
to
his
belt
and
from
his
lips
there
spun
an
epithet
a
hideous
word
which
often
foreshadows
a
word
peculiarly
of
mexico
where
people
have
to
dig
deep
to
find
an
insult
that
has
not
lost
its
savour
the
american
did
not
move
he
was
staring
at
the
fat
mexican
with
a
strange
fixedness
of
gaze
not
fearful
not
dauntless
not
anything
that
could
be
interpreted
he
simply
stared
the
fat
mexican
must
have
been
disconcerted
for
he
continued
to
pose
as
a
grandee
with
more
and
more
sublimity
until
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
have
fallen
over
backward
his
companions
were
swaying
very
drunkenly
they
still
blinked
their
little
beady
eyes
at
richardson
ah
well
sirs
here
was
a
mystery
at
the
approach
of
their
menacing
company
why
did
not
this
american
cry
out
and
turn
pale
or
run
or
pray
them
mercy
the
animal
merely
sat
still
and
stared
and
waited
for
them
to
begin
well
evidently
he
was
a
great
fighter
or
perhaps
he
was
an
idiot
indeed
this
was
an
embarrassing
situation
for
who
was
going
forward
to
discover
whether
he
was
a
great
fighter
or
an
idiot
to
richardson
whose
nerves
were
tingling
and
twitching
like
live
wires
and
whose
heart
jolted
inside
him
this
pause
was
a
long
horror
and
for
these
men
who
could
so
frighten
him
there
began
to
swell
in
him
a
fierce
hatred
a
hatred
that
made
him
long
to
be
capable
of
fighting
all
of
them
a
hatred
that
made
him
capable
of
fighting
all
of
them
a
revolver
can
make
a
hole
large
enough
for
little
boys
to
shoot
marbles
through
and
there
was
a
certain
fat
mexican
with
a
moustache
like
a
snake
who
came
extremely
near
to
have
eaten
his
last
tomale
merely
because
he
frightened
a
man
too
much
jos√©
had
slept
the
first
part
of
the
night
in
his
fashion
his
body
hunched
into
a
heap
his
legs
crooked
his
head
touching
his
knees
shadows
had
obscured
him
from
the
sight
of
the
invaders
at
this
point
he
arose
and
began
to
prowl
quakingly
over
toward
richardson
as
if
he
meant
to
hide
behind
him
of
a
sudden
the
fat
mexican
gave
a
howl
of
glee
jos√©
had
come
within
the
torch
circle
of
light
with
roars
of
ferocity
the
whole
group
of
mexicans
pounced
on
the
american
servant
he
shrank
shuddering
away
from
them
beseeching
by
every
device
of
word
and
gesture
they
pushed
him
this
way
and
that
they
beat
him
with
their
fists
they
stung
him
with
their
curses
as
he
grovelled
on
his
knees
the
fat
mexican
took
him
by
the
throat
and
said
i
am
going
to
kill
you
and
continually
they
turned
their
eyes
to
see
if
they
were
to
succeed
in
causing
the
initial
demonstration
by
the
american
but
he
looked
on
impassively
under
the
blanket
his
fingers
were
clenched
as
iron
upon
the
handle
of
his
revolver
here
suddenly
two
brilliant
clashing
chords
from
the
guitar
were
heard
and
a
woman
voice
full
of
laughter
and
confidence
cried
from
without
hello
hello
where
are
you
the
lurching
company
of
mexicans
instantly
paused
and
looked
at
the
ground
one
said
as
he
stood
with
his
legs
wide
apart
in
order
to
balance
himself
it
is
the
girls
they
have
come
he
screamed
in
answer
to
the
question
of
the
woman
here
and
without
waiting
he
started
on
a
pilgrimage
toward
the
door
one
could
now
hear
a
number
of
female
voices
giggling
and
chattering
two
other
mexicans
said
yes
it
is
the
girls
yes
they
also
started
quietly
away
even
the
fat
mexican
ferocity
seemed
to
be
affected
he
looked
uncertainly
at
the
still
immovable
american
two
of
his
friends
grasped
him
gaily
come
the
girls
are
here
come
he
cast
another
glower
at
richardson
but
this
he
began
laughing
his
comrades
hustled
him
toward
the
door
on
its
threshold
and
holding
back
the
blanket
with
one
hand
he
turned
his
yellow
face
with
a
last
challenging
glare
toward
the
american
jos√©
bewailing
his
state
in
little
sobs
of
utter
despair
and
woe
crept
to
richardson
and
huddled
near
his
knee
then
the
cries
of
the
mexicans
meeting
the
girls
were
heard
and
the
guitar
burst
out
in
joyous
humming
the
moon
clouded
and
but
a
faint
square
of
light
fell
through
the
open
main
door
of
the
house
the
coals
of
the
fire
were
silent
save
for
occasional
sputters
richardson
did
not
change
his
position
he
remained
staring
at
the
blanket
which
hid
the
strategic
door
in
the
far
end
at
his
knees
jos√©
was
arguing
in
a
low
aggrieved
tone
with
the
saints
without
the
mexicans
laughed
and
danced
and
it
would
appear
from
the
sound
drank
more
in
the
stillness
and
the
night
richardson
sat
wondering
if
some
mexican
were
sliding
towards
him
in
the
darkness
and
if
the
first
thing
he
knew
of
it
would
be
the
deadly
sting
of
a
knife
sssh
he
whispered
to
jos√©
he
drew
his
revolver
from
under
the
blanket
and
held
it
on
his
leg
the
blanket
over
the
door
fascinated
him
it
was
a
vague
form
black
and
unmoving
through
the
opening
it
shielded
were
to
come
probably
threats
death
sometimes
he
thought
he
saw
it
move
as
grim
white
sheets
the
black
and
silver
of
coffins
all
the
panoply
of
death
affect
us
because
of
that
which
they
hide
so
this
blanket
dangling
before
a
hole
in
an
adobe
wall
was
to
richardson
a
horrible
emblem
and
a
horrible
thing
in
itself
in
his
present
mood
he
could
not
have
been
brought
to
touch
it
with
his
finger
the
celebrating
mexicans
occasionally
howled
in
song
the
guitarist
played
with
speed
and
enthusiasm
richardson
longed
to
run
but
in
this
vibrating
and
threatening
gloom
his
terror
convinced
him
that
a
move
on
his
part
would
be
a
signal
for
the
pounce
of
death
jos√©
crouching
abjectly
mumbled
now
and
again
slowly
and
ponderous
as
stars
the
minutes
went
suddenly
richardson
thrilled
and
started
his
breath
for
a
moment
left
him
in
sleep
his
nerveless
fingers
had
allowed
his
revolver
to
fall
and
clang
upon
the
hard
floor
he
grabbed
it
up
hastily
and
his
glance
swept
apprehensively
over
the
room
a
chill
blue
light
of
dawn
was
in
the
place
every
outline
was
slowly
growing
detail
was
following
detail
the
dread
blanket
did
not
move
the
riotous
company
had
gone
or
fallen
silent
he
felt
the
effect
of
this
cold
dawn
in
his
blood
the
candour
of
breaking
day
brought
his
nerve
he
touched
jos√©
come
he
said
his
servant
lifted
his
lined
yellow
face
and
comprehended
richardson
buckled
on
his
spurs
and
strode
up
jos√©
obediently
lifted
the
two
great
saddles
richardson
held
two
bridles
and
a
blanket
on
his
left
arm
in
his
right
hand
he
had
his
revolver
they
sneaked
toward
the
door
the
man
who
said
that
spurs
jingled
was
insane
spurs
have
a
mellow
clash
clash
clash
walking
in
spurs
notably
mexican
spurs
you
remind
yourself
vaguely
of
a
telegraphic
linesman
richardson
was
inexpressibly
shocked
when
he
came
to
walk
he
sounded
to
himself
like
a
pair
of
cymbals
he
would
have
known
of
this
if
he
had
reflected
but
then
he
was
escaping
not
reflecting
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
and
from
under
the
two
saddles
jos√©
tried
to
make
one
of
hopeless
horror
richardson
stooped
and
with
shaking
fingers
unfastened
the
spurs
taking
them
in
his
left
hand
he
picked
up
his
revolver
and
they
slunk
on
toward
the
door
on
the
threshold
he
looked
back
in
a
corner
he
saw
watching
him
with
large
eyes
the
indian
man
and
woman
who
had
been
his
hosts
throughout
the
night
they
had
made
no
sign
and
now
they
neither
spoke
nor
moved
yet
richardson
thought
he
detected
meek
satisfaction
at
his
departure
the
street
was
still
and
deserted
in
the
eastern
sky
there
was
a
patch
jos√©
had
picketed
the
horses
at
the
side
of
the
house
as
the
two
men
came
round
the
corner
richardson
beast
set
up
a
whinny
of
welcome
the
little
horse
had
heard
them
coming
he
stood
facing
them
his
ears
cocked
forward
his
eyes
bright
with
welcome
richardson
made
a
frantic
gesture
but
the
horse
in
his
happiness
at
the
appearance
of
his
friends
whinnied
with
enthusiasm
the
american
felt
that
he
could
have
strangled
his
steed
upon
the
threshold
of
safety
he
was
being
betrayed
by
his
horse
his
friend
he
felt
the
same
hate
that
he
would
have
felt
for
a
dragon
and
yet
as
he
glanced
wildly
about
him
he
could
see
nothing
stirring
in
the
street
nothing
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
jos√©
had
his
own
and
both
bridles
buckled
in
a
moment
he
curled
the
with
a
few
sweeps
of
his
arm
the
fingers
however
were
shaking
so
that
he
could
hardly
buckle
the
girth
his
hands
were
in
invisible
mittens
he
was
wondering
calculating
hoping
about
his
horse
he
knew
the
little
willingness
and
courage
under
all
circumstances
up
to
this
time
but
then
here
it
was
different
who
could
tell
if
some
wretched
instance
of
equine
perversity
was
not
about
to
develop
maybe
the
little
fellow
would
not
feel
like
smoking
over
the
plain
at
express
speed
this
morning
and
so
he
would
rebel
and
kick
and
be
wicked
maybe
he
would
be
without
feeling
of
interest
and
run
listlessly
all
riders
who
have
had
to
hurry
in
the
saddle
know
what
it
is
to
be
on
a
horse
who
does
not
understand
the
dramatic
situation
riding
a
lame
sheep
is
bliss
to
it
richardson
fumbling
furiously
at
the
girth
thought
of
these
things
presently
he
had
it
fastened
he
swung
into
the
saddle
and
as
he
did
so
his
horse
made
a
mad
jump
forward
the
spurs
of
jos√©
scratched
and
tore
the
flanks
of
his
great
black
beast
and
side
by
side
the
two
horses
raced
down
the
village
street
the
american
heard
his
horse
breathe
a
quivering
sigh
of
excitement
those
four
feet
skimmed
they
were
as
light
as
fairy
puff
balls
the
houses
glided
past
in
a
moment
and
the
great
clear
silent
plain
appeared
like
a
pale
blue
sea
of
mist
and
wet
bushes
above
the
mountains
the
colours
of
the
sunlight
were
like
the
first
tones
the
opening
chords
of
the
mighty
hymn
of
the
morning
the
american
looked
down
at
his
horse
he
felt
in
his
heart
the
first
thrill
of
confidence
the
little
animal
unurged
and
quite
tranquil
moving
his
ears
this
way
and
that
way
with
an
air
of
interest
in
the
scenery
was
nevertheless
bounding
into
the
eye
of
the
breaking
day
with
the
speed
of
a
frightened
antelope
richardson
looking
down
saw
the
long
fine
reach
of
forelimb
as
steady
as
steel
machinery
as
the
ground
reeled
past
the
long
dried
grasses
hissed
and
cactus
plants
were
dull
blurs
a
wind
whirled
the
horse
mane
over
his
bridle
hand
jos√©
profile
was
lined
against
the
pale
sky
it
was
as
that
of
a
man
who
swims
alone
in
an
ocean
his
eyes
glinted
like
metal
fastened
on
some
unknown
point
ahead
of
him
some
fabulous
place
of
safety
occasionally
his
mouth
puckered
in
a
little
unheard
cry
and
his
legs
bended
back
worked
spasmodically
as
his
spurred
heels
sliced
his
charger
sides
richardson
consulted
the
gloom
in
the
west
for
signs
of
a
yelling
cavalcade
he
knew
that
whereas
his
friends
the
enemy
had
not
attacked
him
when
he
had
sat
still
and
with
apparent
calmness
confronted
them
they
would
take
furiously
after
him
now
that
he
had
run
from
them
now
that
he
had
confessed
himself
the
weaker
their
valour
would
grow
like
weeds
in
the
spring
and
upon
discovering
his
escape
they
would
ride
forth
dauntless
warriors
sometimes
he
was
sure
he
saw
them
sometimes
he
was
sure
he
heard
them
continually
looking
backward
over
his
shoulder
he
studied
the
purple
expanses
where
the
night
was
marching
away
jos√©
rolled
and
shuddered
in
his
saddle
persistently
disturbing
the
stride
of
the
black
horse
fretting
and
worrying
him
until
the
white
foam
flew
and
the
great
shoulders
shone
like
satin
from
the
sweat
at
last
richardson
drew
his
horse
carefully
down
to
a
walk
jos√©
wished
to
rush
insanely
on
but
the
american
spoke
to
him
sternly
as
the
two
paced
forward
side
by
side
richardson
little
horse
thrust
over
his
soft
nose
and
inquired
into
the
black
condition
riding
with
jos√©
was
like
riding
with
a
corpse
his
face
resembled
a
cast
in
lead
sometimes
he
swung
forward
and
almost
pitched
from
his
seat
richardson
was
too
frightened
himself
to
do
anything
but
hate
this
man
for
his
fear
finally
he
issued
a
mandate
which
nearly
caused
jos√©
eyes
to
slide
out
of
his
head
and
fall
to
the
ground
like
two
coins
ride
behind
me
about
fifty
paces
se√±or
stuttered
the
servant
go
cried
the
american
furiously
he
glared
at
the
other
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
revolver
jos√©
looked
at
his
master
wildly
he
made
a
piteous
gesture
then
slowly
he
fell
back
watching
the
hard
face
of
the
american
for
a
sign
of
mercy
but
richardson
had
resolved
in
his
rage
that
at
any
rate
he
was
going
to
use
the
eyes
and
ears
of
extreme
fear
to
detect
the
approach
of
danger
so
he
established
his
servant
as
a
sort
of
outpost
as
they
proceeded
he
was
obliged
to
watch
sharply
to
see
that
the
servant
did
not
slink
forward
and
join
him
when
jos√©
made
beseeching
circles
in
the
air
with
his
arm
he
replied
by
menacingly
gripping
his
revolver
jos√©
had
a
revolver
too
nevertheless
it
was
very
clear
in
his
mind
that
the
revolver
was
distinctly
an
american
weapon
he
had
been
educated
in
the
rio
grande
country
richardson
lost
the
trail
once
he
was
recalled
to
it
by
the
loud
sobs
of
his
servant
then
at
last
jos√©
came
clattering
forward
gesticulating
and
wailing
the
little
horse
sprang
to
the
shoulder
of
the
black
they
were
off
richardson
again
looking
backward
could
see
a
slanting
flare
of
dust
on
the
whitening
plain
he
thought
that
he
could
detect
small
moving
figures
in
it
jos√©
moans
and
cries
amounted
to
a
university
course
in
theology
they
broke
continually
from
his
quivering
lips
his
spurs
were
as
motors
they
forced
the
black
horse
over
the
plain
in
great
headlong
leaps
but
under
richardson
there
was
a
little
insignificant
beast
who
was
running
apparently
with
almost
as
much
effort
as
it
takes
a
bronze
statue
to
stand
still
the
ground
seemed
merely
something
to
be
touched
from
time
to
time
with
hoofs
that
were
as
light
as
blown
leaves
occasionally
richardson
lay
back
and
pulled
stoutly
at
the
bridle
to
keep
from
abandoning
his
servant
jos√©
harried
at
his
horse
mouth
flopped
about
in
the
saddle
and
made
his
two
heels
beat
like
flails
the
black
ran
like
a
horse
in
despair
crimson
serapes
in
the
distance
resemble
drops
of
blood
on
the
great
cloth
of
plain
richardson
began
to
dream
of
all
possible
chances
although
quite
a
humane
man
he
did
not
once
think
of
his
servant
jos√©
being
a
mexican
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
killed
in
mexico
but
for
himself
a
new
yorker
he
remembered
all
the
tales
of
such
races
for
life
and
he
thought
them
badly
written
the
great
black
horse
was
growing
indifferent
the
jabs
of
jos√©
spurs
no
longer
caused
him
to
bound
forward
in
wild
leaps
of
pain
jos√©
had
at
last
succeeded
in
teaching
him
that
spurring
was
to
be
expected
speed
or
no
speed
and
now
he
took
the
pain
of
it
dully
and
stolidly
as
an
animal
who
finds
that
doing
his
best
gains
him
no
respite
jos√©
was
turned
into
a
raving
maniac
he
bellowed
and
screamed
working
his
arms
and
his
heels
like
one
in
a
fit
he
resembled
a
man
on
a
sinking
ship
who
appeals
to
the
ship
richardson
too
cried
madly
to
the
black
horse
the
spirit
of
the
horse
responded
to
these
calls
and
quivering
and
breathing
heavily
he
made
a
great
effort
a
sort
of
a
final
rush
not
for
himself
apparently
but
because
he
understood
that
his
life
sacrifice
perhaps
had
been
invoked
by
these
two
men
who
cried
to
him
in
the
universal
tongue
richardson
had
no
sense
of
appreciation
at
this
time
he
was
too
frightened
but
often
now
he
remembers
a
certain
black
horse
from
the
rear
could
be
heard
a
yelling
and
once
a
shot
was
fired
in
the
air
evidently
richardson
moaned
as
he
looked
back
he
kept
his
hand
on
his
revolver
he
tried
to
imagine
the
brief
tumult
of
his
capture
the
flurry
of
dust
from
the
hoofs
of
horses
pulled
suddenly
to
their
haunches
the
shrill
biting
curses
of
the
men
the
ring
of
the
shots
his
own
last
contortion
he
wondered
too
if
he
could
not
somehow
manage
to
pelt
that
fat
mexican
just
to
cure
his
abominable
egotism
it
was
jos√©
the
who
at
last
discovered
safety
suddenly
he
gave
a
howl
of
delight
and
astonished
his
horse
into
a
new
burst
of
speed
they
were
on
a
little
ridge
at
the
time
and
the
american
at
the
top
of
it
saw
his
servant
gallop
down
the
slope
and
into
the
arms
so
to
speak
of
a
small
column
of
horsemen
in
grey
and
silver
clothes
in
the
dim
light
of
the
early
morning
they
were
as
vague
as
shadows
but
richardson
knew
them
at
once
for
a
detachment
of
rurales
that
crack
cavalry
corps
of
the
mexican
army
which
polices
the
plain
so
zealously
being
of
themselves
the
law
and
the
arm
of
it
a
fierce
and
body
that
knows
little
of
prevention
but
much
of
vengeance
they
drew
up
suddenly
and
the
rows
of
great
sombreros
bobbed
in
surprise
richardson
saw
jos√©
throw
himself
from
his
horse
and
begin
to
jabber
at
the
leader
when
he
arrived
he
found
that
his
servant
had
already
outlined
the
entire
situation
and
was
then
engaged
in
describing
him
richardson
as
an
american
se√±or
of
vast
wealth
who
was
the
friend
of
almost
every
governmental
potentate
within
two
hundred
miles
this
seemed
profoundly
to
impress
the
officer
he
bowed
gravely
to
richardson
and
smiled
significantly
at
his
men
who
unslung
their
carbines
the
little
ridge
hid
the
pursuers
from
view
but
the
rapid
thud
of
their
horses
feet
could
be
heard
occasionally
they
yelled
and
called
to
each
other
then
at
last
they
swept
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
a
wild
mob
of
almost
fifty
drunken
horsemen
when
they
discerned
the
rurales
they
were
sailing
down
the
slope
at
top
speed
if
toboggans
down
a
hill
should
suddenly
make
up
their
minds
to
turn
round
and
go
back
there
would
be
an
effect
something
like
that
produced
by
the
drunken
horsemen
richardson
saw
the
rurales
serenely
swing
their
carbines
forward
and
person
that
he
was
felt
his
heart
leap
into
his
throat
at
the
prospective
volley
but
the
officer
rode
forward
alone
it
appeared
that
the
man
who
owned
the
best
horse
in
this
astonished
company
was
the
fat
mexican
with
the
snaky
moustache
and
in
consequence
this
gentleman
was
quite
a
distance
in
the
van
he
tried
to
pull
up
wheel
his
horse
and
scuttle
back
over
the
hill
as
some
of
his
companions
had
done
but
the
officer
called
to
him
in
a
voice
harsh
with
howled
the
officer
this
se√±or
is
my
friend
the
friend
of
my
friends
do
you
dare
pursue
him
these
dashes
represent
terrible
names
all
different
used
by
the
officer
the
fat
mexican
simply
grovelled
on
his
horse
neck
his
face
was
green
it
could
be
seen
that
he
expected
death
the
officer
stormed
with
magnificent
intensity
finally
he
sprang
from
his
saddle
and
running
to
the
fat
mexican
side
yelled
go
and
kicked
the
horse
in
the
belly
with
all
his
might
the
animal
gave
a
mighty
leap
into
the
air
and
the
fat
mexican
with
one
wretched
glance
at
the
contemplative
rurales
aimed
his
steed
for
the
top
of
the
ridge
richardson
gulped
again
in
expectation
of
a
volley
for
it
is
said
this
is
a
favourite
method
for
disposing
of
objectionable
people
the
fat
green
mexican
also
thought
that
he
was
to
be
killed
on
the
run
from
the
miserable
look
he
cast
at
the
troops
nevertheless
he
was
allowed
to
vanish
in
a
cloud
of
yellow
dust
at
the
jos√©
was
exultant
defiant
and
oh
bristling
with
courage
the
black
horse
was
drooping
sadly
his
nose
to
the
ground
richardson
little
animal
with
his
ears
bent
forward
was
staring
at
the
horses
of
the
rurales
as
if
in
an
intense
study
richardson
longed
for
speech
but
he
could
only
bend
forward
and
pat
the
shining
silken
shoulders
the
little
horse
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
gravely
death
and
the
child
i
the
peasants
who
were
streaming
down
the
mountain
trail
had
in
their
sharp
terror
evidently
lost
their
ability
to
count
the
cattle
and
the
huge
round
bundles
seemed
to
suffice
to
the
minds
of
the
crowd
if
there
were
now
two
in
each
case
where
there
had
been
three
this
brown
stream
poured
on
with
a
constant
wastage
of
goods
and
beasts
a
goat
fell
behind
to
scout
the
dried
grass
and
its
owner
howling
flogging
his
donkeys
passed
far
ahead
a
colt
suddenly
frightened
made
a
stumbling
charge
up
the
the
expenditure
was
always
profligate
and
always
unnamed
unnoted
it
was
as
if
fear
was
a
river
and
this
horde
had
simply
been
caught
in
the
torrent
man
tumbling
over
beast
beast
over
man
as
helpless
in
it
as
the
logs
that
fall
and
shoulder
grindingly
through
the
gorges
of
a
lumber
country
it
was
a
freshet
that
might
sear
the
face
of
the
tall
quiet
mountain
it
might
draw
a
livid
line
across
the
land
this
downpour
of
fear
with
a
thousand
homes
adrift
in
the
current
men
women
babes
animals
from
it
there
arose
a
constant
babble
of
tongues
shrill
broken
and
sometimes
choking
as
from
men
drowning
many
made
gestures
painting
their
agonies
on
the
air
with
fingers
that
twirled
swiftly
the
blue
bay
with
its
pointed
ships
and
the
white
town
lay
below
them
distant
flat
serene
there
was
upon
this
vista
a
peace
that
a
bird
knows
when
high
in
the
air
it
surveys
the
world
a
great
calm
thing
rolling
noiselessly
toward
the
end
of
the
mystery
here
on
the
height
one
felt
the
existence
of
the
universe
scornfully
defining
the
pain
in
ten
thousand
minds
the
sky
was
an
arch
of
stolid
sapphire
even
to
the
mountains
raising
their
mighty
shapes
from
the
valley
this
headlong
rush
of
the
fugitives
was
too
minute
the
sea
the
sky
and
the
hills
combined
in
their
grandeur
to
term
this
misery
inconsequent
then
too
it
sometimes
happened
that
a
face
seen
as
it
passed
on
the
flood
reflected
curiously
the
spirit
of
them
all
and
still
more
one
saw
then
a
woman
of
the
opinion
of
the
vaults
above
the
clouds
when
a
child
cried
it
cried
always
because
of
some
adjacent
misfortune
some
discomfort
of
a
or
rudeness
of
an
encircling
arm
in
the
dismal
melody
of
this
flight
there
were
often
sounding
chords
of
apathy
into
these
preoccupied
countenances
one
felt
that
needles
could
be
thrust
without
purchasing
a
scream
the
trail
wound
here
and
there
as
the
sheep
had
willed
in
the
making
of
it
although
this
throng
seemed
to
prove
that
the
whole
of
humanity
was
fleeing
in
one
direction
with
every
tie
severed
that
binds
us
to
the
soil
a
young
man
was
walking
rapidly
up
the
mountain
hastening
to
a
side
of
the
path
from
time
to
time
to
avoid
some
particularly
wide
rush
of
people
and
cattle
he
looked
at
everything
in
agitation
and
pity
frequently
he
called
admonitions
to
maniacal
fugitives
and
at
other
moments
he
exchanged
strange
stares
with
the
imperturbable
ones
they
seemed
to
him
to
wear
merely
the
expressions
of
so
many
boulders
rolling
down
the
hill
he
exhibited
wonder
and
awe
with
his
pitying
glances
turning
once
toward
the
rear
he
saw
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
of
infantry
marching
the
same
way
he
waited
then
subconsciously
elate
at
a
prospect
of
being
able
to
make
into
words
the
emotion
which
heretofore
had
only
been
expressed
in
the
flash
of
eyes
and
sensitive
movements
of
his
flexible
mouth
he
spoke
to
the
officer
in
rapid
french
waving
his
arms
wildly
and
often
pointing
with
a
dramatic
finger
ah
this
is
too
cruel
too
cruel
too
cruel
is
it
not
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
as
bad
as
this
i
did
not
think
god
mercy
i
did
not
think
at
all
and
yet
i
am
a
greek
or
at
least
my
father
was
a
greek
i
did
not
come
here
to
fight
i
am
really
a
correspondent
you
see
i
was
to
write
for
an
italian
paper
i
have
been
educated
in
italy
i
have
spent
nearly
all
my
life
in
italy
at
the
schools
and
universities
i
knew
nothing
of
war
i
was
a
student
a
student
i
came
here
merely
because
my
father
was
a
greek
and
for
his
sake
i
thought
of
greece
i
loved
greece
but
i
did
not
dream
he
paused
breathing
heavily
his
eyes
glistened
from
that
soft
overflow
which
comes
on
occasion
to
the
glance
of
a
young
woman
eager
passionate
profoundly
moved
his
first
words
while
facing
the
procession
of
fugitives
had
been
an
active
definition
of
his
own
dimension
his
personal
relation
to
men
geography
life
throughout
he
had
preserved
the
fiery
dignity
of
a
tragedian
the
officer
manner
at
once
deferred
to
this
outburst
yes
he
said
polite
but
mournful
these
poor
people
these
poor
people
i
do
not
know
what
is
to
become
of
these
poor
people
the
young
man
declaimed
again
i
had
no
dream
i
had
no
dream
that
it
would
be
like
this
this
is
too
cruel
too
cruel
now
i
want
to
be
a
soldier
now
i
want
to
fight
now
i
want
to
do
battle
for
the
land
of
my
father
he
made
a
sweeping
gesture
into
the
the
officer
was
also
a
young
man
but
he
was
very
bronzed
and
steady
above
his
high
military
collar
of
crimson
cloth
with
one
silver
star
upon
it
appeared
a
profile
stern
quiet
and
confident
respecting
fate
fearing
only
opinion
his
clothes
were
covered
with
dust
the
only
bright
spot
was
the
flame
of
the
crimson
collar
at
the
violent
cries
of
his
companion
he
smiled
as
if
to
himself
meanwhile
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
in
a
glance
ahead
from
a
land
toward
which
their
faces
were
bent
came
a
continuous
boom
of
artillery
fire
it
was
sounding
in
regular
measures
like
the
beating
of
a
colossal
clock
a
clock
that
was
counting
the
seconds
in
the
lives
of
the
stars
and
men
had
time
to
die
between
the
ticks
solemn
oracular
inexorable
the
great
seconds
tolled
over
the
hills
as
if
god
fronted
this
dial
rimmed
by
the
horizon
the
soldier
and
the
correspondent
found
themselves
silent
the
latter
in
particular
was
sunk
in
a
great
mournfulness
as
if
he
had
resolved
to
swing
to
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
where
dwell
secrets
of
his
kind
and
had
learned
beforehand
that
all
to
be
met
there
was
cruelty
and
hopelessness
a
strap
of
his
bright
new
leather
leggings
came
unfastened
and
he
bowed
over
it
slowly
impressively
as
one
bending
over
the
grave
of
a
child
then
suddenly
the
reverberations
mingled
until
one
could
not
separate
an
explosion
from
another
and
into
the
hubbub
came
the
drawling
sound
of
a
leisurely
musketry
fire
instantly
for
some
reason
of
cadence
the
noise
was
irritating
silly
infantile
this
uproar
was
childish
it
forced
the
nerves
to
object
to
protest
against
this
racket
which
was
as
idle
as
the
din
of
a
lad
with
a
drum
the
lieutenant
lifted
his
finger
and
pointed
he
spoke
in
vexed
tones
as
if
he
held
the
other
man
personally
responsible
for
the
noise
well
there
he
said
if
you
wish
for
war
you
now
have
an
opportunity
magnificent
the
correspondent
raised
himself
upon
his
toes
he
tapped
his
chest
with
gloomy
pride
yes
there
is
war
there
is
the
war
i
wish
to
enter
i
fling
myself
in
i
am
a
greek
a
greek
you
understand
i
wish
to
fight
for
my
country
you
know
the
way
lead
me
i
offer
myself
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
he
brought
a
case
from
his
pocket
and
extracting
a
card
handed
it
to
the
officer
with
a
bow
my
name
is
peza
he
said
simply
a
strange
smile
passed
over
the
soldier
face
there
was
pity
and
pride
the
vanity
of
experience
and
contempt
in
it
very
well
he
said
returning
the
bow
if
my
company
is
in
the
middle
of
the
fight
i
shall
be
glad
for
the
honour
of
your
companionship
if
my
company
is
not
in
the
middle
of
the
fight
i
will
make
other
arrangements
for
you
peza
bowed
once
more
very
stiffly
and
correctly
spoke
his
thanks
on
the
edge
of
what
he
took
to
be
a
great
venture
toward
death
he
discovered
that
he
was
annoyed
at
something
in
the
lieutenant
tone
things
immediately
assumed
new
and
extraordinary
proportions
the
battle
the
great
carnival
of
woe
was
sunk
at
once
to
an
equation
with
a
vexation
by
a
stranger
he
wanted
to
ask
the
lieutenant
what
was
his
meaning
he
bowed
again
majestically
the
lieutenant
bowed
they
flung
a
shadow
of
manners
of
capering
tinsel
ceremony
across
a
land
that
groaned
and
it
satisfied
something
within
themselves
completely
in
the
meantime
the
river
of
fleeing
villagers
had
changed
to
simply
a
last
dropping
of
belated
creatures
who
fled
past
stammering
and
flinging
their
hands
high
the
two
men
had
come
to
the
top
of
the
great
hill
before
them
was
a
green
plain
as
level
as
an
inland
sea
it
swept
northward
and
merged
finally
into
a
length
of
silvery
mist
upon
the
near
part
of
this
plain
and
upon
two
grey
treeless
mountains
at
the
side
of
it
were
little
black
lines
from
which
floated
slanting
sheets
of
smoke
it
was
not
a
battle
to
the
nerves
one
could
survey
it
with
equanimity
as
if
it
were
a
but
upon
peza
mind
it
struck
a
loud
clanging
blow
it
was
war
edified
aghast
triumphant
he
paused
suddenly
his
lips
apart
he
remembered
the
pageants
of
carnage
that
had
marched
through
the
dreams
of
his
childhood
love
he
knew
that
he
had
confronted
alone
isolated
wondering
an
individual
an
atom
taking
the
hand
of
a
titanic
principle
but
like
the
faintest
breeze
on
his
forehead
he
felt
here
the
vibration
from
the
hearts
of
forty
thousand
men
the
lieutenant
nostrils
were
moving
i
must
go
at
once
he
said
i
must
go
at
once
i
will
go
with
you
wherever
you
go
shouted
peza
loudly
a
primitive
track
wound
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
in
their
rush
they
bounded
from
here
to
there
choosing
risks
which
in
the
ordinary
caution
of
man
would
surely
have
seemed
of
remarkable
danger
the
ardour
of
the
correspondent
surpassed
the
full
energy
of
the
soldier
several
times
he
turned
and
shouted
come
on
come
on
at
the
foot
of
the
path
they
came
to
a
wide
road
which
extended
toward
the
battle
in
a
yellow
and
straight
line
some
men
were
trudging
wearily
to
the
rear
they
were
without
rifles
their
clumsy
uniforms
were
dirty
and
all
awry
they
turned
eyes
dully
aglow
with
fever
upon
the
pair
striding
toward
the
battle
others
were
bandaged
with
the
triangular
kerchief
upon
which
one
could
still
see
through
bloodstains
the
little
explanatory
pictures
illustrating
the
ways
to
bind
various
wounds
fig
fig
fig
mingled
with
the
pacing
soldiers
were
peasants
indifferent
capable
of
smiling
gibbering
about
the
battle
which
was
to
them
an
ulterior
drama
a
man
was
leading
a
string
of
three
donkeys
to
the
rear
and
at
intervals
he
was
accosted
by
wounded
or
fevered
soldiers
from
whom
he
defended
his
animals
with
cries
and
mad
gesticulation
after
much
chattering
they
usually
subsided
gloomily
and
allowed
him
to
go
with
his
sleek
little
beasts
unburdened
finally
he
encountered
a
soldier
who
walked
slowly
with
the
assistance
of
a
staff
his
head
was
bound
with
a
wide
bandage
grimey
from
blood
and
mud
he
made
application
to
the
peasant
and
immediately
they
were
involved
in
a
hideous
levantine
discussion
the
peasant
whined
and
clamoured
sometimes
spitting
like
a
kitten
the
wounded
soldier
jawed
on
thunderously
his
great
hands
stretched
in
graspings
over
the
peasant
head
once
he
raised
his
staff
and
made
threat
with
it
then
suddenly
the
row
was
at
an
end
the
other
sick
men
saw
their
comrade
mount
the
leading
donkey
and
at
once
begin
to
drum
with
his
heels
none
attempted
to
gain
the
backs
of
the
remaining
animals
they
gazed
after
them
dully
finally
they
saw
the
caravan
outlined
for
a
moment
against
the
sky
the
soldier
was
still
waving
his
arms
passionately
having
it
out
with
the
peasant
peza
was
alive
with
despair
for
these
men
who
looked
at
him
with
such
doleful
quiet
eyes
ah
my
god
he
cried
to
the
lieutenant
these
poor
souls
these
poor
souls
the
officer
faced
about
angrily
if
you
are
coming
with
me
there
is
no
time
for
this
peza
obeyed
instantly
and
with
a
sudden
meekness
in
the
moment
some
portion
of
egotism
left
him
and
he
modestly
wondered
if
the
universe
took
cognizance
of
him
to
an
important
degree
this
theatre
for
slaughter
built
by
the
inscrutable
needs
of
the
earth
was
an
enormous
affair
and
he
reflected
that
the
accidental
destruction
of
an
individual
peza
by
name
would
perhaps
be
nothing
at
all
with
the
lieutenant
he
was
soon
walking
along
behind
a
series
of
little
trenches
in
which
were
soldiers
tranquilly
interested
gossiping
with
the
hum
of
a
although
these
men
were
not
at
this
time
under
fire
he
concluded
that
they
were
fabulously
brave
else
they
would
not
be
so
comfortable
so
at
home
in
their
sticky
brown
trenches
they
were
certain
to
be
heavily
attacked
before
the
day
was
old
the
universities
had
not
taught
him
to
understand
this
attitude
at
the
passing
of
the
young
man
in
very
nice
tweed
with
his
new
leggings
his
new
white
helmet
his
new
case
his
new
revolver
holster
the
soiled
soldiers
turned
with
the
same
curiosity
which
a
being
in
strange
garb
meets
at
the
corners
of
streets
he
might
as
well
have
been
promenading
a
populous
avenue
the
soldiers
volubly
discussed
his
identity
to
peza
there
was
something
awful
in
the
absolute
familiarity
of
each
tone
expression
gesture
these
men
menaced
with
battle
displayed
the
curiosity
of
the
caf√©
then
on
the
verge
of
his
great
encounter
toward
death
he
found
himself
extremely
embarrassed
composing
his
face
with
difficulty
wondering
what
to
do
with
his
hands
like
a
gawk
at
a
lev√©e
he
felt
ridiculous
and
also
he
felt
awed
aghast
at
these
men
who
could
turn
their
faces
from
the
ominous
front
and
debate
his
clothes
his
business
there
was
an
element
which
was
new
born
into
his
theory
of
war
he
was
not
averse
to
the
brisk
pace
at
which
the
lieutenant
moved
along
the
line
the
roar
of
fighting
was
always
in
peza
ears
it
came
from
some
short
hills
ahead
and
to
the
left
the
road
curved
suddenly
and
entered
a
wood
the
trees
stretched
their
luxuriant
and
graceful
branches
over
grassy
slopes
a
breeze
made
all
this
verdure
gently
rustle
and
speak
in
long
silken
sighs
absorbed
in
listening
to
the
hurricane
racket
from
the
front
he
still
remembered
that
these
trees
were
growing
the
were
extending
according
to
their
process
he
inhaled
a
deep
breath
of
moisture
and
fragrance
from
the
grove
a
wet
odour
which
expressed
all
the
opulent
fecundity
of
unmoved
nature
marching
on
with
her
million
plans
for
multiple
life
multiple
death
further
on
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
turkish
shells
were
landing
there
was
a
long
hurtling
sound
in
the
air
and
then
one
had
sight
of
a
shell
to
peza
it
was
of
the
conical
missiles
which
friendly
officers
had
displayed
to
him
on
board
warships
curiously
enough
too
this
first
shell
smacked
of
the
foundry
of
men
with
smudged
faces
of
the
blare
of
furnace
fires
it
brought
machinery
immediately
into
his
mind
he
thought
that
if
he
was
killed
there
at
that
time
it
would
be
as
romantic
to
the
old
standards
as
death
by
a
bit
of
falling
iron
in
a
factory
ii
a
child
was
playing
on
a
mountain
and
disregarding
a
battle
that
was
waging
on
the
plain
behind
him
was
the
little
cobbled
hut
of
his
fled
parents
it
was
now
occupied
by
a
cow
that
stared
out
from
the
darkness
thoughtful
and
the
child
ran
to
and
fro
fumbling
with
sticks
and
making
great
machinations
with
pebbles
by
a
striking
exercise
of
artistic
license
the
sticks
were
ponies
cows
and
dogs
and
the
pebbles
were
sheep
he
was
managing
large
agricultural
and
herding
affairs
he
was
too
intent
on
them
to
pay
much
heed
to
the
fight
four
miles
away
which
at
that
distance
resembled
in
sound
the
beating
of
surf
upon
rocks
however
there
were
occasions
when
some
louder
outbreak
of
that
thunder
stirred
him
from
his
serious
occupation
and
he
turned
then
a
questioning
eye
upon
the
battle
a
small
stick
poised
in
his
hand
interrupted
in
the
act
of
sending
his
dog
after
his
sheep
his
tranquillity
in
regard
to
the
death
on
the
plain
was
as
invincible
as
that
of
the
mountain
on
which
he
stood
it
was
evident
that
fear
had
swept
the
parents
away
from
their
home
in
a
manner
that
could
make
them
forget
this
child
the
nevertheless
the
hut
was
clean
bare
the
cow
had
committed
no
impropriety
in
billeting
herself
at
the
domicile
of
her
masters
this
and
odorous
interior
contained
nothing
as
large
as
a
terror
had
operated
on
these
runaway
people
in
its
sinister
fashion
elevating
details
to
enormous
heights
causing
a
man
to
remember
a
button
while
he
forgot
a
coat
overpowering
every
one
with
recollections
of
a
broken
deluging
them
with
fears
for
the
safety
of
an
old
pipe
and
causing
them
to
forget
their
meanwhile
the
child
played
soberly
with
his
trinkets
he
was
solitary
engrossed
in
his
own
pursuits
it
was
seldom
that
he
lifted
his
head
to
inquire
of
the
world
why
it
made
so
much
noise
the
stick
in
his
hand
was
much
larger
to
him
than
was
an
army
corps
of
the
distance
it
was
too
childish
for
the
mind
of
the
child
he
was
dealing
with
sticks
the
battle
lines
writhed
at
times
in
the
agony
of
a
on
the
sands
these
tentacles
flung
and
waved
in
a
supreme
excitement
of
pain
and
the
struggles
of
the
great
outlined
body
brought
it
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
child
once
he
looked
at
the
plain
and
saw
some
men
running
wildly
across
a
field
he
had
seen
people
chasing
obdurate
beasts
in
such
fashion
and
it
struck
him
immediately
that
it
was
a
manly
thing
which
he
would
incorporate
in
his
game
consequently
he
raced
furiously
at
his
stone
sheep
flourishing
a
cudgel
crying
the
shepherd
calls
he
paused
frequently
to
get
a
cue
of
manner
from
the
soldiers
fighting
on
the
plain
he
reproduced
to
a
degree
any
movements
which
he
accounted
rational
to
his
theory
of
the
business
of
men
the
traditional
and
exalted
living
of
his
father
iii
it
was
as
if
peza
was
a
corpse
walking
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
finding
there
fields
of
grain
groves
weeds
the
faces
of
men
voices
war
a
strange
employment
of
the
race
presented
to
him
a
scene
crowded
with
familiar
objects
which
wore
the
livery
of
their
commonness
placidly
undauntedly
he
was
smitten
with
keen
astonishment
a
spread
of
green
grass
lit
with
the
flames
of
poppies
was
too
old
for
the
company
of
this
new
ogre
if
he
had
been
devoting
the
full
lens
of
his
mind
to
this
phase
he
would
have
known
he
was
amazed
that
the
trees
the
flowers
the
grass
all
tender
and
peaceful
nature
had
not
taken
to
heels
at
once
upon
the
outbreak
of
battle
he
venerated
the
immovable
poppies
the
road
seemed
to
lead
into
the
apex
of
an
angle
formed
by
the
two
defensive
lines
of
the
greeks
there
was
a
straggle
of
wounded
men
and
of
gunless
and
jaded
men
these
latter
did
not
seem
to
be
frightened
they
remained
very
cool
walking
with
unhurried
steps
and
busy
in
gossip
peza
tried
to
define
them
perhaps
during
the
fight
they
had
reached
the
limit
of
their
mental
storage
their
capacity
for
excitement
for
tragedy
and
had
then
simply
come
away
peza
remembered
his
visit
to
a
certain
place
of
pictures
where
he
had
found
himself
amid
heavenly
skies
and
diabolic
midnights
the
sunshine
beating
red
upon
desert
sands
nude
bodies
flung
to
the
shore
in
the
green
ghastly
and
starving
men
clawing
at
a
wall
in
darkness
a
girl
at
her
bath
with
screened
rays
falling
upon
her
pearly
shoulders
a
dance
a
funeral
a
review
an
execution
all
the
strength
of
art
and
he
had
whirled
and
whirled
amid
this
universe
with
cries
of
woe
and
joy
sin
and
beauty
piercing
his
ears
until
he
had
been
obliged
to
simply
come
away
he
remembered
that
as
he
had
emerged
he
had
lit
a
cigarette
with
unction
and
advanced
promptly
to
a
caf√©
a
great
hollow
quiet
seemed
to
be
upon
the
earth
this
was
a
different
case
but
in
his
thoughts
he
conceded
the
same
causes
to
many
of
these
gunless
wanderers
they
too
may
have
dreamed
at
lightning
speed
until
the
capacity
for
it
was
overwhelmed
as
he
watched
them
he
again
saw
himself
walking
toward
the
caf√©
puffing
upon
his
cigarette
as
if
to
reinforce
his
theory
a
soldier
stopped
him
with
an
eager
but
polite
inquiry
for
a
match
he
watched
the
man
light
his
little
roll
of
tobacco
and
paper
and
begin
to
smoke
ravenously
peza
no
longer
was
torn
with
sorrow
at
the
sight
of
wounded
men
evidently
he
found
that
pity
had
a
numerical
limit
and
when
this
was
passed
the
emotion
became
another
thing
now
as
he
viewed
them
he
merely
felt
himself
very
lucky
and
beseeched
the
continuance
of
his
superior
fortune
at
the
passing
of
these
slouched
and
stained
figures
he
now
heard
a
reiteration
of
warning
a
part
of
himself
was
appealing
through
the
medium
of
these
grim
shapes
it
was
plucking
at
his
sleeve
and
pointing
telling
him
to
beware
and
so
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
cared
for
the
implacable
misery
of
these
soldiers
only
as
he
would
have
cared
for
the
harms
of
broken
dolls
his
whole
vision
was
focussed
upon
his
own
chance
the
lieutenant
suddenly
halted
look
he
said
i
find
that
my
duty
is
in
another
direction
i
must
go
another
way
but
if
you
wish
to
fight
you
have
only
to
go
forward
and
any
officer
of
the
fighting
line
will
give
you
opportunity
he
raised
his
cap
ceremoniously
peza
raised
his
new
white
helmet
the
stranger
to
battles
uttered
thanks
to
his
chaperon
the
one
who
had
presented
him
they
bowed
punctiliously
staring
at
each
other
with
civil
eyes
the
lieutenant
moved
quietly
away
through
a
field
in
an
instant
it
flashed
upon
peza
mind
that
this
desertion
was
perfidious
he
had
been
subjected
to
a
criminal
discourtesy
the
officer
had
fetched
him
into
the
middle
of
the
thing
and
then
left
him
to
wander
helplessly
toward
death
at
one
time
he
was
upon
the
point
of
shouting
at
the
officer
in
the
vale
there
was
an
effect
as
if
one
was
then
beneath
the
battle
it
was
going
on
above
somewhere
alone
unguided
peza
felt
like
a
man
groping
in
a
cellar
he
reflected
too
that
one
should
always
see
the
beginning
of
a
fight
it
was
too
difficult
to
thus
approach
it
when
the
affair
was
in
full
swing
the
trees
hid
all
movements
of
troops
from
him
and
he
thought
he
might
be
walking
out
to
the
very
spot
which
chance
had
provided
for
the
reception
of
a
fool
he
asked
eager
questions
of
passing
soldiers
some
paid
no
heed
to
him
others
shook
their
heads
mournfully
they
knew
nothing
save
that
war
was
hard
work
if
they
talked
at
all
it
was
in
testimony
of
having
fought
well
savagely
they
did
not
know
if
the
army
was
going
to
advance
hold
its
ground
or
retreat
they
were
weary
a
long
pointed
shell
flashed
through
the
air
and
struck
near
the
base
of
a
tree
with
a
fierce
upheaval
compounded
of
earth
and
flames
looking
back
peza
could
see
the
shattered
tree
quivering
from
head
to
foot
its
whole
being
underwent
a
convulsive
tremor
which
was
an
exhibition
of
pain
and
furthermore
deep
amazement
as
he
advanced
through
the
vale
the
shells
continued
to
hiss
and
hurtle
in
long
low
flights
and
the
bullets
purred
in
the
air
the
missiles
were
flying
into
the
breast
of
an
astounded
nature
the
landscape
bewildered
agonized
was
suffering
a
rain
of
infamous
shots
and
peza
imagined
a
million
eyes
gazing
at
him
with
the
gaze
of
startled
antelopes
there
was
a
resolute
crashing
of
musketry
from
the
tall
hill
on
the
left
and
from
directly
in
front
there
was
a
mingled
din
of
artillery
and
musketry
firing
peza
felt
that
his
pride
was
playing
a
great
trick
in
forcing
him
forward
in
this
manner
under
conditions
of
strangeness
isolation
and
ignorance
but
he
recalled
the
manner
of
the
lieutenant
the
smile
on
the
among
the
flying
peasants
peza
blushed
and
pulled
the
peak
of
his
helmet
down
on
his
forehead
he
strode
onward
firmly
nevertheless
he
hated
the
lieutenant
and
he
resolved
that
on
some
future
occasion
he
would
take
much
trouble
to
arrange
a
stinging
social
revenge
upon
that
grinning
jackanapes
it
did
not
occur
to
him
until
later
that
he
was
now
going
to
battle
mainly
because
at
a
previous
time
a
certain
man
had
smiled
iv
the
road
curved
round
the
base
of
a
little
hill
and
on
this
hill
a
battery
of
mountain
guns
was
leisurely
shelling
something
unseen
in
the
lee
of
the
height
the
mules
contented
under
their
heavy
saddles
were
quietly
browsing
the
long
grass
peza
ascended
the
hill
by
a
slanting
path
he
felt
his
heart
beat
swiftly
once
at
the
top
of
the
hill
he
would
be
obliged
to
look
this
phenomenon
in
the
face
he
hurried
with
a
mysterious
idea
of
preventing
by
this
strategy
the
battle
from
making
his
appearance
a
signal
for
some
tremendous
renewal
this
vague
thought
seemed
logical
at
the
time
certainly
this
living
thing
had
knowledge
of
his
coming
he
endowed
it
with
the
intelligence
of
a
barbaric
deity
and
so
he
hurried
he
wished
to
surprise
war
this
terrible
emperor
when
it
was
growling
on
its
throne
the
ferocious
and
horrible
sovereign
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
make
the
arrival
a
pretext
for
some
fit
of
smoky
rage
and
blood
in
this
peza
had
distinctly
the
sense
of
stealing
upon
the
battle
unawares
the
soldiers
watching
the
mules
did
not
seem
to
be
impressed
by
anything
august
two
of
them
sat
side
by
side
and
talked
comfortably
another
lay
flat
upon
his
back
staring
dreamily
at
the
sky
another
cursed
a
mule
for
certain
refractions
despite
their
uniforms
their
bandoliers
and
rifles
they
were
dwelling
in
the
peace
of
hostlers
however
the
long
shells
were
whooping
from
time
to
time
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
swirling
in
almost
straight
lines
toward
the
vale
of
trees
flowers
and
grass
peza
hearing
and
seeing
the
shells
and
seeing
the
pensive
guardians
of
the
mules
felt
reassured
they
were
accepting
the
condition
of
war
as
easily
as
an
old
sailor
accepts
the
chair
behind
the
counter
of
a
or
it
was
merely
that
the
had
gone
to
sea
and
he
had
adjusted
himself
to
the
circumstances
immediately
and
with
only
the
usual
first
misadventures
in
conduct
peza
was
proud
and
ashamed
that
he
was
not
of
them
these
stupid
peasants
who
throughout
the
world
hold
potentates
on
their
thrones
make
statesmen
illustrious
provide
generals
with
lasting
victories
all
with
ignorance
indifference
or
hatred
moving
the
world
with
the
strength
of
their
arms
and
getting
their
heads
knocked
together
in
the
name
of
god
the
king
or
the
stock
exchange
immortal
dreaming
hopeless
asses
who
surrender
their
reason
to
the
care
of
a
shining
puppet
and
persuade
some
toy
to
carry
their
lives
in
his
purse
peza
mentally
abased
himself
before
them
and
wished
to
stir
them
with
furious
kicks
as
his
eyes
ranged
above
the
rim
of
the
plateau
he
saw
a
group
of
artillery
officers
talking
busily
they
turned
at
once
and
regarded
his
ascent
a
moment
later
a
row
of
infantry
soldiers
in
a
trench
beyond
the
little
guns
all
faced
him
peza
bowed
to
the
officers
he
understood
at
the
time
that
he
had
made
a
good
and
cool
bow
and
he
wondered
at
it
for
his
breath
was
coming
in
gasps
he
was
stifling
from
sheer
excitement
he
felt
like
a
tipsy
man
trying
to
conceal
his
muscular
uncertainty
from
the
people
in
the
street
but
the
officers
did
not
display
any
knowledge
they
bowed
behind
them
peza
saw
the
plain
glittering
green
with
three
lines
of
black
marked
upon
it
heavily
the
front
of
the
first
of
these
lines
was
frothy
with
smoke
to
the
left
of
this
hill
was
a
craggy
mountain
from
which
came
a
continual
dull
rattle
of
musketry
its
summit
was
ringed
with
the
white
smoke
the
black
lines
on
the
plain
slowly
moved
the
shells
that
came
from
there
passed
overhead
with
the
sound
of
great
birds
frantically
flapping
their
wings
peza
thought
of
the
first
sight
of
the
sea
during
a
storm
he
seemed
to
feel
against
his
face
the
wind
that
races
over
the
tops
of
cold
and
tumultuous
billows
he
heard
a
voice
afar
off
sir
what
would
you
he
turned
and
saw
the
dapper
captain
of
the
battery
standing
beside
him
only
a
moment
had
elapsed
pardon
me
sir
said
peza
bowing
again
the
officer
was
evidently
reserving
his
bows
he
scanned
the
attentively
are
you
a
correspondent
he
asked
peza
produced
a
card
yes
i
came
as
a
correspondent
he
replied
but
now
sir
i
have
other
thoughts
i
wish
to
help
you
see
i
wish
to
help
what
do
you
mean
said
the
captain
are
you
a
greek
do
you
wish
to
fight
yes
i
am
a
greek
i
wish
to
fight
peza
voice
surprised
him
by
coming
from
his
lips
in
even
and
deliberate
tones
he
thought
with
gratification
that
he
was
behaving
rather
well
another
shell
travelling
from
some
unknown
point
on
the
plain
whirled
close
and
furiously
in
the
air
pursuing
an
apparently
horizontal
course
as
if
it
were
never
going
to
touch
the
earth
the
dark
shape
swished
across
the
sky
ah
cried
the
captain
now
smiling
i
am
not
sure
that
we
will
be
able
to
accommodate
you
with
a
fierce
affair
here
just
at
this
time
but
he
walked
gaily
to
and
fro
behind
the
guns
with
peza
pointing
out
to
him
the
lines
of
the
greeks
and
describing
his
opinion
of
the
general
plan
of
defence
he
wore
the
air
of
an
amiable
host
other
officers
questioned
peza
in
regard
to
the
politics
of
the
war
the
king
the
ministry
germany
england
russia
all
these
huge
words
were
continually
upon
their
tongues
and
the
people
in
athens
were
they
amid
this
vivacious
babble
peza
seated
upon
an
ammunition
box
kept
his
glance
high
watching
the
appearance
of
shell
after
shell
these
officers
were
like
men
who
had
been
lost
for
days
in
the
forest
they
were
thirsty
for
any
scrap
of
news
nevertheless
one
of
them
would
occasionally
dispute
their
informant
courteously
what
would
servia
have
to
say
to
that
no
no
france
and
russia
could
never
allow
it
peza
was
elated
the
shells
killed
no
one
war
was
not
so
bad
he
was
simply
having
coffee
in
the
of
some
embassy
where
reverberate
the
names
of
nations
a
rumour
had
passed
along
the
motley
line
of
privates
in
the
trench
the
new
arrival
with
the
clean
white
helmet
was
a
famous
english
cavalry
officer
come
to
assist
the
army
with
his
counsel
they
stared
at
the
figure
of
him
surrounded
by
officers
peza
gaining
sense
of
the
glances
and
whispers
felt
that
his
coming
was
an
event
later
he
resolved
that
he
could
with
temerity
do
something
finer
he
contemplated
the
mountain
where
the
greek
infantry
was
engaged
and
announced
leisurely
to
the
captain
of
the
battery
that
he
thought
presently
of
going
in
that
direction
and
getting
into
the
fight
he
the
sentiments
of
a
patriot
the
captain
seemed
surprised
oh
there
will
be
fighting
here
at
this
knoll
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
orientally
that
will
be
sufficient
you
had
better
stay
with
us
besides
i
have
been
ordered
to
resume
fire
the
officers
all
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
departing
it
was
really
not
worth
the
trouble
the
battery
would
begin
again
directly
then
it
would
be
amusing
for
him
peza
felt
that
he
was
wandering
with
his
protestations
of
high
patriotism
through
a
desert
of
sensible
men
these
officers
gave
no
heed
to
his
exalted
declarations
they
seemed
too
jaded
they
were
fighting
the
men
who
were
fighting
them
palaver
of
the
particular
kind
had
subsided
before
their
intense
in
war
as
a
craft
moreover
many
men
had
talked
in
that
manner
and
only
talked
peza
believed
at
first
that
they
were
treating
him
delicately
they
were
considerate
of
his
inexperience
war
had
turned
out
to
be
such
a
gentle
business
that
peza
concluded
he
could
scorn
this
idea
he
bade
them
a
heroic
farewell
despite
their
objections
however
when
he
reflected
upon
their
ways
afterward
he
saw
dimly
that
they
were
actuated
principally
by
some
universal
childish
desire
for
a
spectator
of
their
fine
things
they
were
going
into
action
and
they
wished
to
be
seen
at
war
precise
and
fearless
v
climbing
slowly
to
the
high
infantry
position
peza
was
amazed
to
meet
a
soldier
whose
jaw
had
been
half
shot
away
and
who
was
being
helped
down
the
sheep
track
by
two
tearful
comrades
the
man
breast
was
drenched
with
blood
and
from
a
cloth
which
he
held
to
the
wound
drops
were
splashing
wildly
upon
the
stones
of
the
path
he
gazed
at
peza
for
a
moment
it
was
a
mystic
gaze
which
peza
withstood
with
difficulty
he
was
exchanging
looks
with
a
spectre
all
aspect
of
the
man
was
somehow
gone
from
this
victim
as
peza
went
on
one
of
the
unwounded
soldiers
loudly
shouted
to
him
to
return
and
assist
in
this
tragic
march
but
even
peza
fingers
revolted
he
was
afraid
of
the
spectre
he
would
not
have
dared
to
touch
it
he
was
surely
craven
in
the
movement
of
refusal
he
made
to
them
he
scrambled
hastily
on
up
the
path
he
was
running
away
at
the
top
of
the
hill
he
came
immediately
upon
a
part
of
the
line
that
was
in
action
another
battery
of
mountain
guns
was
here
firing
at
the
streaks
of
black
on
the
plain
there
were
trenches
filled
with
men
lining
parts
of
the
crest
and
near
the
base
were
other
trenches
all
crashing
away
mightily
the
plain
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
and
from
where
silver
mist
ended
this
emerald
ocean
of
grass
a
great
ridge
of
mountains
poised
against
a
fleckless
blue
sky
two
knolls
green
and
yellow
with
grain
sat
on
the
prairie
confronting
the
dark
hills
of
the
greek
position
between
them
were
the
lines
of
the
enemy
a
row
of
trees
a
village
a
stretch
of
road
showed
faintly
on
this
great
canvas
this
tremendous
picture
but
men
the
turkish
battalions
were
emphasized
startlingly
upon
it
the
ranks
of
troops
between
the
knolls
and
the
greek
position
were
as
black
as
ink
the
first
line
of
course
was
muffled
in
smoke
but
at
the
rear
of
it
battalions
crawled
up
and
to
and
fro
plainer
than
beetles
on
a
plate
peza
had
never
understood
that
masses
of
men
were
so
declarative
so
unmistakable
as
if
nature
makes
every
arrangement
to
give
information
of
the
coming
and
the
presence
of
destruction
the
end
oblivion
the
firing
was
full
complete
a
roar
of
cataracts
and
this
pealing
of
connected
volleys
was
adjusted
to
the
grandeur
of
the
range
of
snowy
mountains
peza
breathless
pale
felt
that
he
had
been
set
upon
a
pillar
and
was
surveying
mankind
the
world
in
the
meantime
dust
had
got
in
his
eye
he
took
his
handkerchief
and
mechanically
administered
to
it
an
officer
with
a
double
stripe
of
purple
on
his
trousers
paced
in
the
rear
of
the
battery
of
howitzers
he
waved
a
little
cane
sometimes
he
paused
in
his
promenade
to
study
the
field
through
his
glasses
a
fine
scene
sir
he
cried
airily
upon
the
approach
of
peza
it
was
like
a
blow
in
the
chest
to
the
volunteer
it
revealed
to
him
a
point
of
view
yes
sir
it
is
a
fine
scene
he
answered
they
spoke
in
french
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
entertain
monsieur
with
a
little
practice
continued
the
officer
i
am
firing
upon
that
mass
of
troops
you
see
there
a
little
to
the
right
they
are
probably
forming
for
another
attack
peza
smiled
here
again
appeared
manners
manners
erect
by
the
side
of
death
the
gun
of
the
battery
thundered
there
was
a
belch
of
fire
and
smoke
the
shell
flung
swiftly
and
afar
was
known
only
to
the
ear
in
which
rang
a
broadening
hooting
wake
of
sound
the
howitzer
had
thrown
itself
backward
convulsively
and
lay
with
its
wheels
moving
in
the
air
as
a
squad
of
men
rushed
toward
it
and
later
it
seemed
as
if
each
little
gun
had
made
the
supreme
effort
of
its
being
in
each
particular
shot
they
roared
with
voices
far
too
loud
and
the
thunderous
effort
caused
a
gun
to
bound
as
in
a
dying
convulsion
and
then
occasionally
one
was
hurled
with
wheels
in
air
these
shuddering
howitzers
presented
an
appearance
of
so
many
cowards
always
longing
to
bolt
to
the
rear
but
being
implacably
held
to
their
business
by
this
throng
of
soldiers
who
ran
in
squads
to
drag
them
up
again
to
their
obligation
the
guns
were
herded
and
cajoled
and
bullied
interminably
one
by
one
in
relentless
program
they
were
dragged
forward
to
contribute
a
profound
vibration
of
steel
and
wood
a
flash
and
a
roar
to
the
important
happiness
of
man
the
adjacent
infantry
celebrated
a
good
shot
with
smiles
and
an
outburst
of
gleeful
talk
look
sir
cried
an
officer
to
peza
thin
smoke
was
drifting
lazily
before
peza
and
dodging
impatiently
he
brought
his
eyes
to
bear
upon
that
part
of
the
plain
indicated
by
the
officer
finger
the
infantry
was
advancing
to
attack
from
the
black
lines
had
come
forth
an
inky
mass
which
was
shaped
much
like
a
human
tongue
it
advanced
slowly
casually
without
apparent
spirit
but
with
an
insolent
confidence
that
was
like
a
proclamation
of
the
inevitable
the
impetuous
part
was
all
played
by
the
defensive
side
officers
called
men
plucked
each
other
by
the
sleeve
there
were
shouts
motions
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
inky
mass
which
was
flowing
toward
the
base
of
the
hills
heavily
languorously
as
oily
and
thick
as
one
of
the
streams
that
ooze
through
a
swamp
peza
was
chattering
a
question
at
every
one
in
the
way
pushed
aside
or
in
the
way
again
he
continued
to
repeat
it
can
they
take
the
position
can
they
take
the
position
can
they
take
the
position
he
was
apparently
addressing
an
assemblage
of
deaf
men
every
eye
was
busy
watching
every
hand
the
soldiers
did
not
even
seem
to
see
the
interesting
stranger
in
the
white
helmet
who
was
crying
out
so
feverishly
finally
however
the
hurried
captain
of
the
battery
espied
him
and
heeded
his
question
no
sir
no
sir
it
is
impossible
he
shouted
angrily
his
manner
seemed
to
denote
that
if
he
had
sufficient
time
he
would
have
completely
insulted
peza
the
latter
swallowed
the
crumb
of
news
without
regard
to
the
coating
of
scorn
and
waving
his
hand
in
adieu
he
began
to
run
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
toward
the
part
of
the
greek
line
against
which
the
attack
was
directed
vi
peza
as
he
ran
along
the
crest
of
the
mountain
believed
that
his
action
was
receiving
the
wrathful
attention
of
the
hosts
of
the
foe
to
him
then
it
was
incredible
foolhardiness
thus
to
call
to
himself
the
stares
of
thousands
of
hateful
eyes
he
was
like
a
lad
induced
by
playmates
to
commit
some
indiscretion
in
a
cathedral
he
was
abashed
perhaps
he
even
blushed
as
he
ran
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
whole
solemn
ceremony
of
war
had
paused
during
this
commission
so
he
scrambled
wildly
over
the
rocks
in
his
haste
to
end
the
embarrassing
ordeal
when
he
came
among
the
crowning
filled
with
eager
soldiers
he
wanted
to
yell
with
joy
none
noticed
him
save
a
young
officer
of
infantry
who
said
sir
what
do
you
want
it
was
obvious
that
people
had
devoted
some
attention
to
their
own
affairs
peza
asserted
in
greek
that
he
wished
above
everything
to
battle
for
the
fatherland
the
officer
nodded
with
a
smile
he
pointed
to
some
dead
men
covered
with
blankets
from
which
were
thrust
upturned
dusty
shoes
yes
i
know
i
know
cried
peza
he
thought
the
officer
was
poetically
alluding
to
the
danger
no
said
the
officer
at
once
i
mean
cartridges
a
bandolier
take
a
bandolier
from
one
of
them
peza
went
cautiously
toward
a
body
he
moved
a
hand
toward
the
corner
of
a
blanket
there
he
hesitated
stuck
as
if
his
arm
had
turned
to
plaster
hearing
a
rustle
behind
him
he
spun
quickly
three
soldiers
of
the
close
rank
in
the
trench
were
regarding
him
the
officer
came
again
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
have
you
any
tobacco
peza
looked
at
him
in
bewilderment
his
hand
was
still
extended
toward
the
blanket
which
covered
the
dead
soldier
yes
he
said
i
have
some
tobacco
he
gave
the
officer
his
pouch
as
if
in
compensation
the
other
directed
a
soldier
to
strip
the
bandolier
from
the
corpse
peza
having
crossed
the
long
cartridge
belt
on
his
breast
felt
that
the
dead
man
had
flung
his
two
arms
around
him
a
soldier
with
a
polite
nod
and
smile
gave
peza
a
rifle
a
relic
of
another
dead
man
thus
he
felt
besides
the
clutch
of
a
corpse
about
his
neck
that
the
rifle
was
as
inhumanly
horrible
as
a
snake
that
lives
in
a
tomb
he
heard
at
his
ear
something
that
was
in
effect
like
the
voices
of
those
two
dead
men
their
low
voices
speaking
to
him
of
bloody
death
mutilation
the
bandolier
gripped
him
tighter
he
wished
to
raise
his
hands
to
his
throat
like
a
man
who
is
choking
the
rifle
was
clammy
upon
his
palms
he
felt
the
movement
of
the
sluggish
currents
of
a
serpent
life
it
was
crawling
and
frightful
all
about
him
were
these
peasants
with
their
interested
countenances
gibbering
of
the
fight
from
time
to
time
a
soldier
cried
out
in
lamentations
descriptive
of
his
thirst
one
bearded
man
sat
munching
a
great
bit
of
hard
bread
fat
greasy
squat
he
was
like
an
idol
made
of
tallow
peza
felt
dimly
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
this
man
and
a
young
student
who
could
write
sonnets
and
play
the
piano
quite
well
this
old
blockhead
was
coolly
gnawing
at
the
bread
while
he
peza
was
being
throttled
by
a
dead
man
arms
he
looked
behind
him
and
saw
that
a
head
by
some
chance
had
been
uncovered
from
its
blanket
two
eyes
were
staring
into
his
face
the
head
was
turned
a
little
sideways
as
if
to
get
better
opportunity
for
the
scrutiny
peza
could
feel
himself
blanch
he
was
being
drawn
and
drawn
by
these
dead
men
slowly
firmly
down
as
to
some
mystic
chamber
under
the
earth
where
they
could
walk
dreadful
figures
swollen
and
he
was
bidden
they
had
commanded
him
he
was
going
going
going
when
the
man
in
the
new
white
helmet
bolted
for
the
rear
many
of
the
soldiers
in
the
trench
thought
that
he
had
been
struck
but
those
who
had
been
nearest
to
him
knew
better
otherwise
they
would
have
heard
the
silken
sliding
tender
noise
of
the
bullet
and
the
thud
of
its
impact
they
bawled
after
him
curses
and
also
outbursts
of
and
vanity
despite
the
prominence
of
the
cowardly
part
they
were
enabled
to
see
in
this
exhibition
a
fine
comment
upon
their
own
fortitude
the
other
soldiers
thought
that
peza
had
been
wounded
somewhere
in
the
neck
because
as
he
ran
he
was
tearing
madly
at
the
bandolier
the
dead
man
arms
the
soldier
with
the
bread
paused
in
his
eating
and
cynically
remarked
upon
the
speed
of
the
runaway
an
officer
voice
was
suddenly
heard
calling
out
the
calculation
of
the
distance
to
the
enemy
the
readjustment
of
the
sights
there
was
a
stirring
rattle
along
the
line
the
men
turned
their
eyes
to
the
front
other
trenches
beneath
them
to
the
right
were
already
heavily
in
action
the
smoke
was
lifting
toward
the
blue
sky
the
soldier
with
the
bread
placed
it
carefully
on
a
bit
of
paper
beside
him
as
he
turned
to
kneel
in
the
trench
vii
in
the
late
afternoon
the
child
ceased
his
play
on
the
mountain
with
his
flocks
and
his
dogs
part
of
the
battle
had
whirled
very
near
to
the
base
of
his
hill
and
the
noise
was
great
sometimes
he
could
see
fantastic
smoky
shapes
which
resembled
the
curious
figures
in
foam
which
one
sees
on
the
slant
of
a
rough
sea
the
plain
indeed
was
etched
in
white
circles
and
whirligigs
like
the
slope
of
a
colossal
wave
the
child
took
seat
on
a
stone
and
contemplated
the
fight
he
was
beginning
to
be
astonished
he
had
never
before
seen
cattle
herded
with
such
uproar
lines
of
flame
flashed
out
here
and
there
it
was
mystery
finally
without
any
preliminary
indication
he
began
to
weep
if
the
men
struggling
on
the
plain
had
had
time
and
greater
vision
they
could
have
seen
this
strange
tiny
figure
seated
on
a
boulder
surveying
them
while
the
tears
streamed
it
was
as
simple
as
some
powerful
symbol
as
the
magic
clear
light
of
day
amid
the
mountains
dimmed
the
distances
and
the
plain
shone
as
a
pallid
blue
cloth
marked
by
the
red
threads
of
the
firing
the
child
arose
and
moved
off
to
the
unwelcoming
door
of
his
home
he
called
softly
for
his
mother
and
complained
of
his
hunger
in
the
familiar
formula
the
cow
grinding
her
jaws
thoughtfully
stared
at
him
with
her
large
eyes
the
peaceful
gloom
of
evening
was
slowly
draping
the
hills
the
child
heard
a
rattle
of
loose
stones
on
the
hillside
and
facing
the
sound
saw
a
moment
later
a
man
drag
himself
up
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
fall
panting
forgetting
his
mother
and
his
hunger
filled
with
calm
interest
the
child
walked
forward
and
stood
over
the
heaving
form
his
eyes
too
were
now
large
and
inscrutably
wise
and
sad
like
those
of
the
animal
in
the
house
after
a
silence
he
spoke
inquiringly
are
you
a
man
peza
rolled
over
quickly
and
gazed
up
into
the
fearless
cherubic
countenance
he
did
not
attempt
to
reply
he
breathed
as
if
life
was
about
to
leave
his
body
he
was
covered
with
dust
his
face
had
been
cut
in
some
way
and
his
cheek
was
ribboned
with
blood
all
the
spick
of
his
former
appearance
had
vanished
in
a
general
dishevelment
in
which
he
resembled
a
creature
that
had
been
flung
to
and
fro
up
and
down
by
cliffs
and
prairies
during
an
earthquake
he
rolled
his
eye
glassily
at
the
child
they
remained
thus
until
the
child
repeated
his
words
are
you
a
man
peza
gasped
in
the
manner
of
a
fish
palsied
windless
and
abject
he
confronted
the
primitive
courage
the
sovereign
child
the
brother
of
the
mountains
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
he
knew
that
the
definition
of
his
misery
could
be
written
on
a
part
ii
midnight
sketches
an
experiment
in
misery
from
the
press
new
york
it
was
late
at
night
and
a
fine
rain
was
swirling
softly
down
causing
the
pavements
to
glisten
with
hue
of
steel
and
blue
and
yellow
in
the
rays
of
the
innumerable
lights
a
youth
was
trudging
slowly
without
enthusiasm
with
his
hands
buried
deep
in
his
trouser
pockets
towards
the
places
where
beds
can
be
hired
for
coppers
he
was
clothed
in
an
aged
and
tattered
suit
and
his
derby
was
a
marvel
of
crown
and
torn
rim
he
was
going
forth
to
eat
as
the
wanderer
may
eat
and
sleep
as
the
homeless
sleep
by
the
time
he
had
reached
city
hall
park
he
was
so
completely
plastered
with
yells
of
bum
and
hobo
and
with
various
unholy
epithets
that
small
boys
had
applied
to
him
at
intervals
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
profound
dejection
the
sifting
rain
saturated
the
old
velvet
collar
of
his
overcoat
and
as
the
wet
cloth
pressed
against
his
neck
he
felt
that
there
no
longer
could
be
pleasure
in
life
he
looked
about
him
searching
for
an
outcast
of
highest
degree
that
they
too
might
share
miseries
but
the
lights
threw
a
quivering
glare
over
rows
and
circles
of
deserted
benches
that
glistened
damply
showing
patches
of
wet
sod
behind
them
it
seemed
that
their
usual
freights
had
fled
on
this
night
to
better
things
there
were
only
squads
of
brooklyn
people
who
swarmed
towards
the
bridge
the
young
man
loitered
about
for
a
time
and
then
went
shuffling
off
down
park
row
in
the
sudden
descent
in
style
of
the
dress
of
the
crowd
he
felt
relief
and
as
if
he
were
at
last
in
his
own
country
he
began
to
see
tatters
that
matched
his
tatters
in
chatham
square
there
were
aimless
men
strewn
in
front
of
saloons
and
standing
sadly
patiently
reminding
one
vaguely
of
the
attitudes
of
chickens
in
a
storm
he
aligned
himself
with
these
men
and
turned
slowly
to
occupy
himself
with
the
flowing
life
of
the
great
street
through
the
mists
of
the
cold
and
storming
night
the
cable
cars
went
in
silent
procession
great
affairs
shining
with
red
and
brass
moving
with
formidable
power
calm
and
irresistible
dangerful
and
gloomy
breaking
silence
only
by
the
loud
fierce
cry
of
the
gong
two
rivers
of
people
swarmed
along
the
side
walks
spattered
with
black
mud
which
made
each
shoe
leave
a
impression
overhead
elevated
trains
with
a
shrill
grinding
of
the
wheels
stopped
at
the
station
which
upon
its
pillars
seemed
to
resemble
some
monstrous
kind
of
crab
squatting
over
the
street
the
quick
fat
puffings
of
the
engines
could
be
heard
down
an
alley
there
were
sombre
curtains
of
purple
and
black
on
which
street
lamps
dully
glittered
like
embroidered
flowers
a
saloon
stood
with
a
voracious
air
on
a
corner
a
sign
leaning
against
the
front
of
the
announced
free
hot
soup
the
swing
doors
snapping
to
and
fro
like
ravenous
lips
made
gratified
smacks
as
the
saloon
gorged
itself
with
plump
men
eating
with
astounding
and
endless
appetite
smiling
in
some
indescribable
manner
as
the
men
came
from
all
directions
like
sacrifices
to
a
heathenish
superstition
caught
by
the
delectable
sign
the
young
man
allowed
himself
to
be
swallowed
a
placed
a
schooner
of
dark
and
portentous
beer
on
the
bar
its
monumental
form
until
the
froth
was
above
the
crown
of
the
young
man
brown
derby
soup
over
there
gents
said
the
affably
a
little
yellow
man
in
rags
and
the
youth
grasped
their
schooners
and
went
with
speed
toward
a
lunch
counter
where
a
man
with
oily
but
imposing
whiskers
ladled
genially
from
a
kettle
until
he
had
furnished
his
two
mendicants
with
a
soup
that
was
steaming
hot
and
in
which
there
were
little
floating
suggestions
of
chicken
the
young
man
sipping
his
broth
felt
the
cordiality
expressed
by
the
warmth
of
the
mixture
and
he
beamed
at
the
man
with
oily
but
imposing
whiskers
who
was
presiding
like
a
priest
behind
an
altar
have
some
more
gents
he
inquired
of
the
two
sorry
figures
before
him
the
little
yellow
man
accepted
with
a
swift
gesture
but
the
youth
shook
his
head
and
went
out
following
a
man
whose
wondrous
seediness
promised
that
he
would
have
a
knowledge
of
cheap
on
the
he
accosted
the
seedy
man
say
do
you
know
a
cheap
place
to
sleep
the
other
hesitated
for
a
time
gazing
sideways
finally
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
street
i
sleep
up
there
he
said
when
got
the
price
how
much
ten
cents
the
young
man
shook
his
head
dolefully
that
too
rich
for
me
at
that
moment
there
approached
the
two
a
reeling
man
in
strange
garments
his
head
was
a
fuddle
of
bushy
hair
and
whiskers
from
which
his
eyes
peered
with
a
guilty
slant
in
a
close
scrutiny
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
the
cruel
lines
of
a
mouth
which
looked
as
if
its
lips
had
just
closed
with
satisfaction
over
some
tender
and
piteous
morsel
he
appeared
like
an
assassin
steeped
in
crimes
performed
awkwardly
but
at
this
time
his
voice
was
tuned
to
the
coaxing
key
of
an
affectionate
puppy
he
looked
at
the
men
with
wheedling
eyes
and
began
to
sing
a
little
melody
for
charity
say
gents
ca
yeh

a
poor
feller

couple
of
cents

luck
an
i
the
seedy
man
staring
with
imperturbable
countenance
at
a
train
which
clattered
overhead
interrupted
in
an
expressionless
voice
ah
go
h
but
the
youth
spoke
to
the
prayerful
assassin
in
tones
of
astonishment
and
inquiry
say
you
must
be
crazy
why
do
yeh
strike
somebody
that
looks
as
if
they
had
money
the
assassin
tottering
about
on
his
uncertain
legs
and
at
intervals
brushing
imaginary
obstacles
from
before
his
nose
entered
into
a
long
explanation
of
the
psychology
of
the
situation
it
was
so
profound
that
it
was
unintelligible
when
he
had
exhausted
the
subject
the
young
man
said
to
him
let
see
th
five
cents
the
assassin
wore
an
expression
of
drunken
woe
at
this
sentence
filled
with
suspicion
of
him
with
a
deeply
pained
air
he
began
to
fumble
in
his
clothing
his
red
hands
trembling
presently
he
announced
in
a
voice
of
bitter
grief
as
if
he
had
been
betrayed
there
four
four
said
the
young
man
thoughtfully
well
i
a
stranger
here
an
if
ye
steer
me
to
your
cheap
joint
i
find
the
other
three
the
assassin
countenance
became
instantly
radiant
with
joy
his
whiskers
quivered
with
the
wealth
of
his
alleged
emotions
he
seized
the
young
man
hand
in
a
transport
of
delight
and
friendliness
b
gawd
he
cried
if
ye
do
that
b
gawd
i
say

was
a
damned
good
fellow
i
would
an
i
remember

all

with
drunken
dignity
b
gawd
i

i
would
an
i
allus

the
young
man
drew
back
looking
at
the
assassin
coldly
oh
all
right
he
said
you
show
me
th
joint
that
all
you
got
do
the
assassin
gesticulating
gratitude
led
the
young
man
along
a
dark
street
finally
he
stopped
before
a
little
dusty
door
he
raised
his
hand
impressively
he
said
and
there
was
a
thrill
of
deep
and
ancient
wisdom
upon
his
face
i
brought
yeh
here
that
my
part
ai
it
if
th
place
do

yeh
yeh
need
git
mad
at
me

there
wo
be
no
bad
feelin
will
there
no
said
the
young
man
the
assassin
waved
his
arm
tragically
and
led
the
march
up
the
steep
stairway
on
the
way
the
young
man
furnished
the
assassin
with
three
pennies
at
the
top
a
man
with
benevolent
spectacles
looked
at
them
through
a
hole
in
a
board
he
collected
their
money
wrote
some
names
on
a
register
and
speedily
was
leading
the
two
men
along
a
corridor
shortly
after
the
beginning
of
this
journey
the
young
man
felt
his
liver
turn
white
for
from
the
dark
and
secret
places
of
the
building
there
suddenly
came
to
his
nostrils
strange
and
unspeakable
odours
that
assailed
him
like
malignant
diseases
with
wings
they
seemed
to
be
from
human
bodies
closely
packed
in
dens
the
exhalations
from
a
hundred
pairs
of
reeking
lips
the
fumes
from
a
thousand
bygone
debauches
the
expression
of
a
thousand
present
miseries
a
man
naked
save
for
a
little
undershirt
was
parading
sleepily
along
the
corridor
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
giving
vent
to
a
prodigious
yawn
demanded
to
be
told
the
time
one
the
man
yawned
again
he
opened
a
door
and
for
a
moment
his
form
was
outlined
against
a
black
opaque
interior
to
this
door
came
the
three
men
and
as
it
was
again
opened
the
unholy
odours
rushed
out
like
fiends
so
that
the
young
man
was
obliged
to
struggle
as
against
an
overpowering
wind
it
was
some
time
before
the
youth
eyes
were
good
in
the
intense
gloom
within
but
the
man
with
benevolent
spectacles
led
him
skilfully
pausing
but
a
moment
to
deposit
the
limp
assassin
upon
a
cot
he
took
the
youth
to
a
cot
that
lay
tranquilly
by
the
window
and
showing
him
a
tall
locker
for
clothes
that
stood
near
the
head
with
the
ominous
air
of
a
tombstone
left
him
the
youth
sat
on
his
cot
and
peered
about
him
there
was
a
in
a
distant
part
of
the
room
that
burned
a
small
flickering
flame
it
caused
vast
masses
of
tumbled
shadows
in
all
parts
of
the
place
save
where
immediately
about
it
there
was
a
little
grey
haze
as
the
young
man
eyes
became
used
to
the
darkness
he
could
see
upon
the
cots
that
thickly
littered
the
floor
the
forms
of
men
sprawled
out
lying
in
silence
or
heaving
and
snoring
with
tremendous
effort
like
stabbed
fish
the
youth
locked
his
derby
and
his
shoes
in
the
mummy
case
near
him
and
then
lay
down
with
an
old
and
familiar
coat
around
his
shoulders
a
blanket
he
handed
gingerly
drawing
it
over
part
of
the
coat
the
cot
was
covered
with
leather
and
as
cold
as
melting
snow
the
youth
was
obliged
to
shiver
for
some
time
on
this
affair
which
was
like
a
slab
presently
however
his
chill
gave
him
peace
and
during
this
period
of
leisure
from
it
he
turned
his
head
to
stare
at
his
friend
the
assassin
whom
he
could
dimly
discern
where
he
lay
sprawled
on
a
cot
in
the
abandon
of
a
man
filled
with
drink
he
was
snoring
with
incredible
vigour
his
wet
hair
and
beard
dimly
glistened
and
his
inflamed
nose
shone
with
subdued
lustre
like
a
red
light
in
a
fog
within
reach
of
the
youth
hand
was
one
who
lay
with
yellow
breast
and
shoulders
bare
to
the
cold
drafts
one
arm
hung
over
the
side
of
the
cot
and
the
fingers
lay
full
length
upon
the
wet
cement
floor
of
the
room
beneath
the
inky
brows
could
be
seen
the
eyes
of
the
man
exposed
by
the
partly
opened
lids
to
the
youth
it
seemed
that
he
and
this
being
were
exchanging
a
prolonged
stare
and
that
the
other
threatened
with
his
eyes
he
drew
back
watching
his
neighbour
from
the
shadows
of
his
blanket
edge
the
man
did
not
move
once
through
the
night
but
lay
in
this
stillness
as
of
death
like
a
body
stretched
out
expectant
of
the
surgeon
knife
and
all
through
the
room
could
be
seen
the
tawny
hues
of
naked
flesh
limbs
thrust
into
the
darkness
projecting
beyond
the
cots
upreared
knees
arms
hanging
long
and
thin
over
the
cot
edges
for
the
most
part
they
were
statuesque
carven
dead
with
the
curious
lockers
standing
all
about
like
tombstones
there
was
a
strange
effect
of
a
graveyard
where
bodies
were
merely
flung
yet
occasionally
could
be
seen
limbs
wildly
tossing
in
fantastic
nightmare
gestures
accompanied
by
guttural
cries
grunts
oaths
and
there
was
one
fellow
off
in
a
gloomy
corner
who
in
his
dreams
was
oppressed
by
some
frightful
calamity
for
of
a
sudden
he
began
to
utter
long
wails
that
went
almost
like
yells
from
a
hound
echoing
wailfully
and
weird
through
this
chill
place
of
tombstones
where
men
lay
like
the
dead
the
sound
in
its
high
piercing
beginnings
that
dwindled
to
final
melancholy
moans
expressed
a
red
and
grim
tragedy
of
the
unfathomable
possibilities
of
the
man
dreams
but
to
the
youth
these
were
not
merely
the
shrieks
of
a
man
they
were
an
utterance
of
the
meaning
of
the
room
and
its
occupants
it
was
to
him
the
protest
of
the
wretch
who
feels
the
touch
of
the
imperturbable
granite
wheels
and
who
then
cries
with
an
impersonal
eloquence
with
a
strength
not
from
him
giving
voice
to
the
wail
of
a
whole
section
a
class
a
people
this
weaving
into
the
young
man
brain
and
mingling
with
his
views
of
the
vast
and
sombre
shadows
that
like
mighty
black
fingers
curled
around
the
naked
bodies
made
the
young
man
so
that
he
did
not
sleep
but
lay
carving
the
biographies
for
these
men
from
his
meagre
experience
at
times
the
fellow
in
the
corner
howled
in
a
writhing
agony
of
his
imaginations
finally
a
long
of
grey
light
shot
through
the
dusty
panes
of
the
window
without
the
young
man
could
see
roofs
drearily
white
in
the
dawning
the
point
of
light
yellowed
and
grew
brighter
until
the
golden
rays
of
the
morning
sun
came
in
bravely
and
strong
they
touched
with
radiant
colour
the
form
of
a
small
fat
man
who
snored
in
stuttering
fashion
his
round
and
shiny
bald
head
glowed
suddenly
with
the
valour
of
a
decoration
he
sat
up
blinked
at
the
sun
swore
fretfully
and
pulled
his
blanket
over
the
ornamental
splendours
of
his
head
the
youth
contentedly
watched
this
rout
of
the
shadows
before
the
bright
spears
of
the
sun
and
presently
he
slumbered
when
he
awoke
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
assassin
raised
in
valiant
curses
putting
up
his
head
he
perceived
his
comrade
seated
on
the
side
of
the
cot
engaged
in
scratching
his
neck
with
long
that
rasped
like
files
hully
jee
dis
is
a
new
breed
they
got
on
their
feet
he
continued
in
a
violent
tirade
the
young
man
hastily
unlocked
his
closet
and
took
out
his
shoes
and
hat
as
he
sat
on
the
side
of
the
cot
lacing
his
shoes
he
glanced
about
and
saw
that
daylight
had
made
the
room
comparatively
and
uninteresting
the
men
whose
faces
seemed
stolid
serene
or
absent
were
engaged
in
dressing
while
a
great
crackle
of
bantering
conversation
arose
a
few
were
parading
in
unconcerned
nakedness
here
and
there
were
men
of
brawn
whose
skins
shone
clear
and
ruddy
they
took
splendid
poses
standing
massively
like
chiefs
when
they
had
dressed
in
their
ungainly
garments
there
was
an
extraordinary
change
they
then
showed
bumps
and
deficiencies
of
all
kinds
there
were
others
who
exhibited
many
deformities
shoulders
were
slanting
humped
pulled
this
way
and
pulled
that
way
and
notable
among
these
latter
men
was
the
little
fat
man
who
had
refused
to
allow
his
head
to
be
glorified
his
pudgy
form
builded
like
a
pear
bustled
to
and
fro
while
he
swore
in
fashion
it
appeared
that
some
article
of
his
apparel
had
vanished
the
young
man
attired
speedily
and
went
to
his
friend
the
assassin
at
first
the
latter
looked
dazed
at
the
sight
of
the
youth
this
face
seemed
to
be
appealing
to
him
through
the
cloud
wastes
of
his
memory
he
scratched
his
neck
and
reflected
at
last
he
grinned
a
broad
smile
gradually
spreading
until
his
countenance
was
a
round
illumination
hello
willie
he
cried
cheerily
hello
said
the
young
man
are
yeh
ready
t
fly
sure
the
assassin
tied
his
shoe
carefully
with
some
twine
and
came
ambling
when
he
reached
the
street
the
young
man
experienced
no
sudden
relief
from
unholy
atmospheres
he
had
forgotten
all
about
them
and
had
been
breathing
naturally
and
with
no
sensation
of
discomfort
or
distress
he
was
thinking
of
these
things
as
he
walked
along
the
street
when
he
was
suddenly
startled
by
feeling
the
assassin
hand
trembling
with
excitement
clutching
his
arm
and
when
the
assassin
spoke
his
voice
went
into
quavers
from
a
supreme
agitation
i
be
hully
bloomin
blowed
if
there
was
a
feller
with
a
nightshirt
on
up
there
in
that
joint
the
youth
was
bewildered
for
a
moment
but
presently
he
turned
to
smile
indulgently
at
the
assassin
humour
oh
you
a
d
d
liar
he
merely
said
whereupon
the
assassin
began
to
gesture
extravagantly
and
take
oath
by
strange
gods
he
frantically
placed
himself
at
the
mercy
of
remarkable
fates
if
his
tale
were
not
true
yes
he
did
i
cross
thousan
times
he
protested
and
at
the
moment
his
eyes
were
large
with
amazement
his
mouth
wrinkled
in
unnatural
glee
yessir
a
nightshirt
a
hully
white
nightshirt
you
lie
no
sir
i
hope
ter
die
i
kin
git

a
hully
bloomin
white
nightshirt
his
face
was
filled
with
the
infinite
wonder
of
it
a
hully
white
nightshirt
he
continually
repeated
the
young
man
saw
the
dark
entrance
to
a
basement
restaurant
there
was
a
sign
which
read
no
mystery
about
our
hash
and
there
were
other
and
legends
which
told
him
that
the
place
was
within
his
means
he
stopped
before
it
and
spoke
to
the
assassin
i
guess
i
git
somethin
t
eat
at
this
the
assassin
for
some
reason
appeared
to
be
quite
embarrassed
he
gazed
at
the
seductive
front
of
the
eating
place
for
a
moment
then
he
started
slowly
up
the
street
well
willie
he
said
bravely
for
an
instant
the
youth
studied
the
departing
figure
then
he
called
out
hol
on
a
minnet
as
they
came
together
he
spoke
in
a
certain
fierce
way
as
if
he
feared
that
the
other
would
think
him
to
be
charitable
if
yeh
wanta

some
breakfas
i
lend
yeh
three
cents

said
the
assassin
earnestly

an
if
yeh

that
for
me
b
gawd
i
say
yeh
was
th
whitest
lad
i
ever
see
they
spent
a
few
moments
in
dexterous
exchanges
of
phrases
in
which
they
each
protested
that
the
other
was
as
the
assassin
had
originally
said
a
and
they
concluded
with
mutual
assurances
that
they
were
the
souls
of
intelligence
and
virtue
then
they
went
into
the
restaurant
there
was
a
long
counter
dimly
lighted
from
hidden
sources
two
or
three
men
in
soiled
white
aprons
rushed
here
and
there
the
youth
bought
a
bowl
of
coffee
for
two
cents
and
a
roll
for
one
cent
the
assassin
purchased
the
same
the
bowls
were
webbed
with
brown
seams
and
the
tin
spoons
wore
an
air
of
having
emerged
from
the
first
pyramid
upon
them
were
black
encrustations
of
age
and
they
were
bent
and
scarred
from
the
attacks
of
teeth
but
over
their
repast
the
wanderers
waxed
warm
and
mellow
the
assassin
grew
affable
as
the
hot
mixture
went
soothingly
down
his
parched
throat
and
the
young
man
felt
courage
flow
in
his
veins
memories
began
to
throng
in
on
the
assassin
and
he
brought
forth
long
tales
intricate
incoherent
delivered
with
a
chattering
swiftness
as
from
an
old

as
they
were
passing
from
the
dim
eating
place
they
encountered
an
old
man
who
was
trying
to
steal
forth
with
a
tiny
package
of
food
but
a
tall
man
with
an
indomitable
moustache
stood
dragon
fashion
barring
the
way
of
escape
they
heard
the
old
man
raise
a
plaintive
protest
ah
you
always
want
to

what

take

and
you
never
see
that

usually
bring

package

from
my
place
of

as
the
wanderers
trudged
slowly
along
park

the
assassin
began
to
expand
and
grow
blithe
b
gawd

livin
like

he
said
smacking
appreciative
lips
look
out
or
we
have

pay

it
said
the
youth
with
gloomy
warning
but
the
assassin
refused
to
turn
his
gaze
toward
the
future
he
went
with
a
limping
step
into
which
he
injected
a
suggestion
of
lamblike
gambols
his
mouth
was
wreathed
in
a
red
grin
in
the
city
hall
park
the
two
wanderers
sat
down
in
the
little
circle
of
benches
sanctified
by
traditions
of
their
class
they
huddled
in
their
old
garments
slumbrously
conscious
of
the
march
of
the
hours
which
for
them
had
no
meaning
the
people
of
the
street
hurrying
hither
and
thither
made
a
blend
of
black
figures
changing
yet
they
walked
in
their
good
clothes
as
upon
important
missions
giving
no
gaze
to
the
two
wanderers
seated
upon
the
benches
they
expressed
to
the
young
man
his
infinite
distance
from
all
that
he
valued
social
position
comfort
the
pleasures
of
living
were
unconquerable
kingdoms
he
felt
a
sudden
awe
and
in
the
background
a
multitude
of
buildings
of
pitiless
hues
and
sternly
high
were
to
him
emblematic
of
a
nation
forcing
its
regal
head
into
the
clouds
throwing
no
downward
glances
in
the
sublimity
of
its
aspirations
ignoring
the
wretches
who
may
flounder
at
its
feet
the
roar
of
the
city
in
his
ear
was
to
him
the
confusion
of
strange
tongues
babbling
heedlessly
it
was
the
clink
of
coin
the
voice
of
the
city
hopes
which
were
to
him
no
hopes
he
confessed
himself
an
outcast
and
his
eyes
from
under
the
lowered
rim
of
his
hat
began
to
glance
guiltily
wearing
the
criminal
expression
that
comes
with
certain
convictions
the
men
in
the
storm
the
blizzard
began
to
swirl
great
clouds
of
snow
along
the
streets
sweeping
it
down
from
the
roofs
and
up
from
the
pavements
until
the
faces
of
pedestrians
tingled
and
burned
as
from
a
thousand
those
on
the
walks
huddled
their
necks
closely
in
the
collars
of
their
coats
and
went
along
stooping
like
a
race
of
aged
people
the
drivers
of
vehicles
hurried
their
horses
furiously
on
their
way
they
were
made
more
cruel
by
the
exposure
of
their
position
aloft
on
high
seats
the
street
cars
bound
up
town
went
slowly
the
horses
slipping
and
straining
in
the
spongy
brown
mass
that
lay
between
the
rails
the
drivers
muffled
to
the
eyes
stood
erect
facing
the
wind
models
of
grim
philosophy
overhead
trains
rumbled
and
roared
and
the
dark
structure
of
the
elevated
railroad
stretching
over
the
avenue
dripped
little
streams
and
drops
of
water
upon
the
mud
and
snow
beneath
all
the
clatter
of
the
street
was
softened
by
the
masses
that
lay
upon
the
cobbles
until
even
to
one
who
looked
from
a
window
it
became
important
music
a
melody
of
life
made
necessary
to
the
ear
by
the
dreariness
of
the
pitiless
beat
and
sweep
of
the
storm
occasionally
one
could
see
black
figures
of
men
busily
shovelling
the
white
drifts
from
the
walks
the
sounds
from
their
labour
created
new
recollections
of
rural
experiences
which
every
man
manages
to
have
in
a
measure
later
the
immense
windows
of
the
shops
became
aglow
with
light
throwing
great
beams
of
orange
and
yellow
upon
the
pavement
they
were
infinitely
cheerful
yet
in
a
way
they
accentuated
the
force
and
discomfort
of
the
storm
and
gave
a
meaning
to
the
pace
of
the
people
and
the
vehicles
scores
of
pedestrians
and
drivers
wretched
with
cold
faces
necks
and
feet
speeding
for
scores
of
unknown
doors
and
entrances
scattering
to
an
infinite
variety
of
shelters
to
places
which
the
imagination
made
warm
with
the
familiar
colours
of
home
there
was
an
absolute
expression
of
hot
dinners
in
the
pace
of
the
people
if
one
dared
to
speculate
upon
the
destination
of
those
who
came
trooping
he
lost
himself
in
a
maze
of
social
calculation
he
might
fling
a
handful
of
sand
and
attempt
to
follow
the
flight
of
each
particular
grain
but
as
to
the
suggestion
of
hot
dinners
he
was
in
firm
lines
of
thought
for
it
was
upon
every
hurrying
face
it
is
a
matter
of
tradition
it
is
from
the
tales
of
childhood
it
comes
forth
with
every
storm
however
in
a
certain
part
of
a
dark
street
there
was
a
collection
of
men
to
whom
these
things
were
as
if
they
were
not
in
this
street
was
located
a
charitable
house
where
for
five
cents
the
homeless
of
the
city
could
get
a
bed
at
night
and
in
the
morning
coffee
and
bread
during
the
afternoon
of
the
storm
the
whirling
snows
acted
as
drivers
as
men
with
whips
and
at
three
the
walk
before
the
closed
doors
of
the
house
was
covered
with
wanderers
of
the
street
waiting
for
some
distance
on
either
side
of
the
place
they
could
be
seen
lurking
in
the
doorways
and
behind
projecting
parts
of
buildings
gathering
in
close
bunches
in
an
effort
to
get
warm
a
covered
wagon
drawn
up
near
the
curb
sheltered
a
dozen
of
them
under
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
elevated
railway
station
there
were
six
or
eight
their
hands
stuffed
deep
in
their
pockets
their
shoulders
stooped
jiggling
their
feet
others
always
could
be
seen
coming
a
strange
procession
some
slouching
along
with
the
characteristic
hopeless
gait
of
professional
strays
some
coming
with
hesitating
steps
wearing
the
air
of
men
to
whom
this
sort
of
thing
was
new
it
was
an
afternoon
of
incredible
length
the
snow
blowing
in
twisting
clouds
sought
out
the
men
in
their
meagre
and
skilfully
beat
in
among
them
drenching
their
persons
with
showers
of
fine
stinging
flakes
they
crowded
together
muttering
and
fumbling
in
their
pockets
to
get
their
red
inflamed
wrists
covered
by
the
cloth
usually
halted
at
one
end
of
the
groups
and
addressed
a
question
perhaps
much
as
a
matter
of
form
is
it
open
yet
those
who
had
been
waiting
inclined
to
take
the
questioner
seriously
and
became
contemptuous
no
do
yeh
think
we
be
standin
here
the
gathering
swelled
in
numbers
steadily
and
persistently
one
could
always
see
them
coming
trudging
slowly
through
the
storm
finally
the
little
snow
plains
in
the
street
began
to
assume
a
leaden
hue
from
the
shadows
of
evening
the
buildings
upreared
gloomily
save
where
various
windows
became
brilliant
figures
of
light
that
made
shimmers
and
splashes
of
yellow
on
the
snow
a
street
lamp
on
the
curb
struggled
to
illuminate
but
it
was
reduced
to
impotent
blindness
by
the
swift
gusts
of
sleet
crusting
its
panes
in
this
the
men
began
to
come
from
their
shelter
places
and
mass
in
front
of
the
doors
of
charity
they
were
of
all
types
but
the
nationalities
were
mostly
american
german
and
irish
many
were
strong
healthy
fellows
with
that
stamp
of
countenance
which
is
not
frequently
seen
upon
seekers
after
charity
there
were
men
of
undoubted
patience
industry
and
temperance
who
in
time
of
do
not
habitually
turn
to
rail
at
the
state
of
society
snarling
at
the
arrogance
of
the
rich
and
bemoaning
the
cowardice
of
the
poor
but
who
at
these
times
are
apt
to
wear
a
sudden
and
singular
meekness
as
if
they
saw
the
world
progress
marching
from
them
and
were
trying
to
perceive
where
they
had
failed
what
they
had
lacked
to
be
thus
vanquished
in
the
race
then
there
were
others
of
the
shifting
bowery
element
who
were
used
to
paying
ten
cents
for
a
place
to
sleep
but
who
now
came
here
because
it
was
cheaper
but
they
were
all
mixed
in
one
mass
so
thoroughly
that
one
could
not
have
discerned
the
different
elements
but
for
the
fact
that
the
labouring
men
for
the
most
part
remained
silent
and
impassive
in
the
blizzard
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
windows
of
the
house
statues
of
patience
the
sidewalk
soon
became
completely
blocked
by
the
bodies
of
the
men
they
pressed
close
to
one
another
like
sheep
in
a
winter
gale
keeping
one
another
warm
by
the
heat
of
their
bodies
the
snow
came
down
upon
this
compressed
group
of
men
until
directly
from
above
it
might
have
appeared
like
a
heap
of
merchandise
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
crowd
swayed
gently
with
a
unanimous
rhythmical
motion
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
the
snow
lay
upon
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
these
men
in
little
ridges
an
inch
thick
perhaps
in
places
the
flakes
steadily
adding
drop
and
drop
precisely
as
they
fall
upon
the
unresisting
grass
of
the
fields
the
feet
of
the
men
were
all
wet
and
cold
and
the
wish
to
warm
them
accounted
for
the
slow
gentle
rhythmical
motion
occasionally
some
man
whose
ear
or
nose
tingled
acutely
from
the
cold
winds
would
wriggle
down
until
his
head
was
protected
by
the
shoulders
of
his
companions
there
was
a
continuous
murmuring
discussion
as
to
the
probability
of
the
doors
being
speedily
opened
they
persistently
lifted
their
eyes
towards
the
windows
one
could
hear
little
combats
of
opinion
there
a
light
in
th
winder
naw
it
a
reflection
f
across
th
way
well
did
i
see
light
it
you
did
i
did
well
then
that
settles
it
as
the
time
approached
when
they
expected
to
be
allowed
to
enter
the
men
crowded
to
the
doors
in
an
unspeakable
crush
jamming
and
wedging
in
a
way
that
it
seemed
would
crack
bones
they
surged
heavily
against
the
building
in
a
powerful
wave
of
pushing
shoulders
once
a
rumour
flitted
among
all
the
tossing
heads
they
ca
open
th
door
th
fellers
er
smack
up
agin
then
a
dull
roar
of
rage
came
from
the
men
on
the
outskirts
but
all
the
time
they
strained
and
pushed
until
it
appeared
to
be
impossible
for
those
that
they
cried
out
against
to
do
anything
but
be
crushed
into
pulp
ah

men
in
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
occasionally
yelled
when
a
of
one
of
trampling
feet
crushed
on
their
freezing
extremities
git

yeh
clumsy
tarrier
say

a
man
near
the
doors
suddenly
shouted
le
me
out
le
me
out
and
another
a
man
of
infinite
valour
once
twisted
his
head
so
as
to
half
face
those
who
were
pushing
behind
him
quit
yer
shovin
yeh
and
he
delivered
a
volley
of
the
most
powerful
and
singular
invective
straight
into
the
faces
of
the
men
behind
him
it
was
as
if
he
was
hammering
the
noses
of
them
with
curses
of
triple
brass
his
face
red
with
rage
could
be
seen
upon
it
an
expression
of
sublime
disregard
of
consequences
but
nobody
cared
to
reply
to
his
imprecations
it
was
too
cold
many
of
them
snickered
and
all
continued
to
push
in
occasional
pauses
of
the
crowd
movement
the
men
had
opportunities
to
make
jokes
usually
grim
things
and
no
doubt
very
uncouth
nevertheless
they
were
notable
one
does
not
expect
to
find
the
quality
of
humour
in
a
heap
of
old
clothes
under
a
the
winds
seemed
to
grow
fiercer
as
time
wore
on
some
of
the
gusts
of
snow
that
came
down
on
the
close
collection
of
heads
cut
like
knives
and
needles
and
the
men
huddled
and
swore
not
like
dark
assassins
but
in
a
sort
of
american
fashion
grimly
and
desperately
it
is
true
but
yet
with
a
wondrous
indefinable
and
mystic
as
if
there
was
some
kind
of
humour
in
this
catastrophe
in
this
situation
in
a
night
of
winds
once
the
window
of
the
huge
shop
across
the
street
furnished
material
for
a
few
moments
of
forgetfulness
in
the
space
appeared
the
figure
of
a
man
he
was
rather
stout
and
very
well
clothed
his
beard
was
fashioned
charmingly
after
that
of
the
prince
of
wales
he
stood
in
an
attitude
of
magnificent
reflection
he
slowly
stroked
his
moustache
with
a
certain
grandeur
of
manner
and
looked
down
at
the
mob
from
below
there
was
denoted
a
supreme
complacence
in
him
it
seemed
that
the
sight
operated
inversely
and
enabled
him
to
more
clearly
regard
his
own
delightful
environment
one
of
the
mob
chanced
to
turn
his
head
and
perceived
the
figure
in
the
window
hello
lookit
whiskers
he
said
genially
many
of
the
men
turned
then
and
a
shout
went
up
they
called
to
him
in
all
strange
keys
they
addressed
him
in
every
manner
from
familiar
and
cordial
greetings
to
advice
concerning
changes
in
his
personal
appearance
the
man
presently
fled
and
the
mob
chuckled
ferociously
like
ogres
who
had
just
devoured
something
they
turned
then
to
serious
business
often
they
addressed
the
stolid
front
of
the
house
oh
let
us
in
fer
gawd
sake
let
us
in
or
we
all
drop
dead
say
what
th
use
o
keepin
us
poor
indians
out
in
th
cold
and
always
some
one
was
saying
keep
off
my
feet
the
crushing
of
the
crowd
grew
terrific
toward
the
last
the
men
in
keen
pain
from
the
blasts
began
almost
to
fight
with
the
pitiless
whirl
of
snow
upon
them
the
battle
for
shelter
was
going
to
the
strong
it
became
known
that
the
basement
door
at
the
foot
of
a
little
steep
flight
of
stairs
was
the
one
to
be
opened
and
they
jostled
and
heaved
in
this
direction
like
labouring
fiends
one
could
hear
them
panting
and
groaning
in
their
fierce
exertion
usually
some
one
in
the
front
ranks
was
protesting
to
those
in
the
rear
oh
say
now
fellers
let
up
will
yeh
do
yeh
wanta
kill
somebody
a
policeman
arrived
and
went
into
the
midst
of
them
scolding
and
occasionally
threatening
but
using
no
force
but
that
of
his
hands
and
shoulders
against
these
men
who
were
only
struggling
to
get
in
out
of
the
storm
his
decisive
tones
rang
out
sharply
stop
that
pushin
back
there
come
boys
do
push
stop
that
here
you
quit
yer
shovin
cheese
that
when
the
door
below
was
opened
a
thick
stream
of
men
forced
a
way
down
the
stairs
which
were
of
an
extraordinary
narrowness
and
seemed
only
wide
enough
for
one
at
a
time
yet
they
somehow
went
down
almost
three
abreast
it
was
a
difficult
and
painful
operation
the
crowd
was
like
a
turbulent
water
forcing
itself
through
one
tiny
outlet
the
men
in
the
rear
excited
by
the
success
of
the
others
made
frantic
exertions
for
it
seemed
that
this
large
band
would
more
than
fill
the
quarters
and
that
many
would
be
left
upon
the
pavements
it
would
be
disastrous
to
be
of
the
last
and
accordingly
men
with
the
snow
biting
their
faces
writhed
and
twisted
with
their
might
one
expected
that
from
the
tremendous
pressure
the
narrow
passage
to
the
basement
door
would
be
so
choked
and
clogged
with
human
limbs
and
bodies
that
movement
would
be
impossible
once
indeed
the
crowd
was
forced
to
stop
and
a
cry
went
along
that
a
man
had
been
injured
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
presently
the
slow
movement
began
again
and
the
policeman
fought
at
the
top
of
the
flight
to
ease
the
pressure
of
those
that
were
going
down
a
reddish
light
from
a
window
fell
upon
the
faces
of
the
men
when
they
in
turn
arrived
at
the
last
three
steps
and
were
about
to
enter
one
could
then
note
a
change
of
expression
that
had
come
over
their
features
as
they
stood
thus
upon
the
threshold
of
their
hopes
they
looked
suddenly
contented
and
complacent
the
fire
had
passed
from
their
eyes
and
the
snarl
had
vanished
from
their
lips
the
very
force
of
the
crowd
in
the
rear
which
had
previously
vexed
them
was
regarded
from
another
point
of
view
for
it
now
made
it
inevitable
that
they
should
go
through
the
little
doors
into
the
place
that
was
cheery
and
warm
with
light
the
tossing
crowd
on
the
sidewalk
grew
smaller
and
smaller
the
snow
beat
with
merciless
persistence
upon
the
bowed
heads
of
those
who
waited
the
wind
drove
it
up
from
the
pavements
in
frantic
forms
of
winding
white
and
it
seethed
in
circles
about
the
huddled
forms
passing
in
one
by
one
three
by
three
out
of
the
storm
the
duel
that
was
not
fought
patsy
tulligan
was
not
as
wise
as
seven
owls
but
his
courage
could
throw
a
shadow
as
long
as
the
steeple
of
a
cathedral
there
were
men
on
cherry
street
who
had
whipped
him
five
times
but
they
all
knew
that
patsy
would
be
as
ready
for
the
sixth
time
as
if
nothing
had
happened
once
he
and
two
friends
had
been
away
up
on
eighth
avenue
far
out
of
their
country
and
upon
their
return
journey
that
evening
they
stopped
frequently
in
saloons
until
they
were
as
independent
of
their
surroundings
as
eagles
and
cared
much
less
about
thirty
days
on
blackwell
on
lower
sixth
avenue
they
paused
in
a
saloon
where
there
was
a
good
deal
of
and
polished
wood
to
be
seen
from
the
outside
and
within
the
mellow
light
shone
on
much
furbished
brass
and
more
polished
wood
it
was
a
better
saloon
than
they
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
but
they
did
not
mind
it
they
sat
down
at
one
of
the
little
tables
that
were
in
a
row
parallel
to
the
bar
and
ordered
beer
they
blinked
stolidly
at
the
decorations
the
and
the
other
customers
when
anything
transpired
they
discussed
it
with
dazzling
frankness
and
what
they
said
of
it
was
as
free
as
air
to
the
other
people
in
the
place
at
midnight
there
were
few
people
in
the
saloon
patsy
and
his
friends
still
sat
drinking
two
men
were
at
another
table
smoking
cigars
slowly
and
swinging
back
in
their
chairs
they
occupied
themselves
with
themselves
in
the
usual
manner
never
betraying
by
a
wink
of
an
eyelid
that
they
knew
that
other
folk
existed
at
another
table
directly
behind
patsy
and
his
companions
was
a
slim
little
cuban
with
miraculously
small
feet
and
hands
and
with
a
youthful
touch
of
down
upon
his
lip
as
he
lifted
his
cigarette
from
time
to
time
his
little
finger
was
bended
in
dainty
fashion
and
there
was
a
green
flash
when
a
huge
emerald
ring
caught
the
light
the
came
often
with
his
little
brass
tray
occasionally
patsy
and
his
two
friends
quarrelled
once
this
little
cuban
happened
to
make
some
slight
noise
and
patsy
turned
his
head
to
observe
him
then
patsy
made
a
careless
and
rather
loud
comment
to
his
two
friends
he
used
a
word
which
is
no
more
than
passing
the
time
of
day
down
in
cherry
street
but
to
the
cuban
it
was
a
there
was
a
harsh
scraping
sound
as
a
chair
was
pushed
swiftly
back
the
little
cuban
was
upon
his
feet
his
eyes
were
shining
with
a
rage
that
flashed
there
like
sparks
as
he
glared
at
patsy
his
olive
face
had
turned
a
shade
of
grey
from
his
anger
withal
his
chest
was
thrust
out
in
portentous
dignity
and
his
hand
still
grasping
his
was
cool
and
steady
the
little
finger
still
bended
the
great
emerald
gleaming
upon
it
the
others
motionless
stared
at
him
sir
he
began
ceremoniously
he
spoke
gravely
and
in
a
slow
way
his
tone
coming
in
a
marvel
of
cadences
from
between
those
lips
which
quivered
with
wrath
you
have
insult
me
you
are
a
dog
a
hound
a
cur
i
spit
upon
you
i
must
have
some
of
your
blood
patsy
looked
at
him
over
his
shoulder
what
th
matter
wi
che
he
demanded
he
did
not
quite
understand
the
words
of
this
little
man
who
glared
at
him
steadily
but
he
knew
that
it
was
something
about
fighting
he
snarled
with
the
readiness
of
his
class
and
heaved
his
shoulders
contemptuously
ah
what
yeh
take
a
walk
you
got
nothin
t
do
with
me
have
yeh
well
den
go
sit
on
yerself
and
his
companions
leaned
back
valorously
in
their
chairs
and
scrutinized
this
slim
young
fellow
who
was
addressing
patsy
what
de
little
dago
chewin
about
he
wants
t
scrap
what
the
cuban
listened
with
apparent
composure
it
was
only
when
they
laughed
that
his
body
cringed
as
if
he
was
receiving
lashes
presently
he
put
down
his
glass
and
walked
over
to
their
table
he
proceeded
always
with
the
most
impressive
deliberation
sir
he
began
again
you
have
insult
me
i
must
have
i
must
have
your
body
upon
the
point
of
my
sword
in
my
country
you
would
already
be
dead
i
must
have
patsy
had
looked
at
the
cuban
with
a
trifle
of
bewilderment
but
at
last
his
face
began
to
grow
dark
with
belligerency
his
mouth
curve
in
that
wide
sneer
with
which
he
would
confront
an
angel
of
darkness
he
arose
suddenly
in
his
seat
and
came
towards
the
little
cuban
he
was
going
to
be
impressive
too
say
young
feller
if
yeh
go
shootin
off
fer
face
at
me
i
wipe

joint
wid

me
up
fer
a
cinch
i
fool
yeh
dat
what
do
take
me
fer
no
dead
easy
mug
and
as
he
glowered
at
the
little
cuban
he
ended
his
oration
with
one
eloquent
word
nit
the
nervously
polished
his
bar
with
a
towel
and
kept
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
men
occasionally
he
became
transfixed
with
interest
leaning
forward
with
one
hand
upon
the
edge
of
the
bar
and
the
other
holding
the
towel
grabbed
in
a
lump
as
if
he
had
been
turned
into
bronze
when
in
the
very
act
of
polishing
the
cuban
did
not
move
when
patsy
came
toward
him
and
delivered
his
oration
at
its
conclusion
he
turned
his
livid
face
toward
where
above
him
patsy
was
swaggering
and
heaving
his
shoulders
in
a
consummate
display
of
bravery
and
readiness
the
cuban
in
his
clear
tense
tones
spoke
one
word
it
was
the
bitter
insult
it
seemed
to
fairly
spin
from
his
lips
and
crackle
in
the
air
like
breaking
glass
every
man
save
the
little
cuban
made
an
electric
movement
patsy
roared
a
black
oath
and
thrust
himself
forward
until
he
towered
almost
directly
above
the
other
man
his
fists
were
doubled
into
knots
of
bone
and
hard
flesh
the
cuban
had
raised
a
steady
finger
if
you
touch
me
wis
your
hand
i
will
keel
you
the
two
men
had
come
swiftly
uttering
protesting
cries
they
suddenly
intervened
in
this
second
of
time
in
which
patsy
had
sprung
forward
and
the
cuban
had
uttered
his
threat
the
four
men
were
now
a
tossing
arguing
violent
group
one
man
lecturing
the
cuban
and
the
other
holding
off
patsy
who
was
now
wild
with
rage
loudly
repeating
the
cuban
threat
and
manoeuvring
and
struggling
to
get
at
him
for
revenge
sake
the
feverishly
scouring
away
with
his
towel
and
at
times
pacing
to
and
fro
with
nervous
and
excited
tread
shouted
out
say
for
heaven
sake
do
fight
in
here
if
yeh
wanta
fight
go
out
in
the
street
and
fight
all
yeh
please
but
do
fight
in
here
patsy
knew
only
one
thing
and
this
he
kept
repeating
well
he
wants
t
scrap
i
did
begin
dis
he
wants
t
scrap
the
man
confronting
him
continually
replied
oh
well
now
look
here
he
only
a
lad
he
do
know
what
doing
he
crazy
mad
you
would
slug
a
kid
like
that
patsy
and
his
aroused
companions
who
cursed
and
growled
were
persistent
with
their
argument
well
he
wants
t
scrap
the
whole
affair
was
as
plain
as
daylight
when
one
saw
this
great
fact
the
interference
and
intolerable
discussion
brought
the
three
of
them
forward
battleful
and
fierce
what
eatin
you
anyhow
they
demanded
dis
ai
your
business
is
it
what
business
you
got
shootin
off
your
face
the
other
peacemaker
was
trying
to
restrain
the
little
cuban
who
had
grown
shrill
and
violent
if
he
touch
me
wis
his
hand
i
will
keel
him
we
must
fight
like
gentlemen
or
else
i
keel
him
when
he
touch
me
wis
his
hand
the
man
who
was
fending
off
patsy
comprehended
these
sentences
that
were
screamed
behind
his
back
and
he
explained
to
patsy
but
he
wants
to
fight
you
with
swords
with
swords
you
know
the
cuban
dodging
around
the
peacemakers
yelled
in
patsy
face
ah
if
i
could
get
you
before
me
wis
my
sword
ah
ah
patsy
made
a
furious
blow
with
a
swift
fist
but
the
peacemakers
bucked
against
his
body
suddenly
like
football
players
patsy
was
greatly
puzzled
he
continued
doggedly
to
try
to
get
near
enough
to
the
cuban
to
punch
him
to
these
attempts
the
cuban
replied
savagely
if
you
touch
me
wis
your
hand
i
will
cut
your
heart
in
two
piece
at
last
patsy
said
well
if
he
so
dead
stuck
on
fightin
wid
swords
i
fight
soitenly
i
fight
all
this
palaver
had
evidently
tired
him
and
he
now
puffed
out
his
lips
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
willing
to
submit
to
any
conditions
if
he
can
only
bring
on
the
row
soon
enough
he
swaggered
i
fight
wid
swords
let
bring
on
his
swords
an
i
fight
he
ready
t
quit
the
two
men
grinned
why

and
resolute
i
giv
a
go
at
it
anyhow
an
i
stay
wid
long
as
i
kin
as
for
the
cuban
his
lithe
little
body
was
quivering
in
an
ecstasy
of
the
muscles
his
face
radiant
with
a
savage
joy
he
fastened
his
glance
upon
patsy
his
eyes
gleaming
with
a
gloating
murderous
light
a
most
unspeakable
rage
was
in
his
expression
ah
ah
he
will
fight
me
ah
he
bended
unconsciously
in
the
posture
of
a
fencer
he
had
all
the
quick
springy
movements
of
a
skilful
swordsman
ah
the
the
i
will
stick
him
like
a
pig
the
two
peacemakers
still
grinning
broadly
were
having
a
great
time
with
patsy
why

infernal
idiot
this
man
would
slice
you
all
up
you
better
jump
off
the
bridge
if

want
to

you
would
stand
a
ghost
of
a

was
as
unshaken
as
granite
well
if
he
wants
t
fight

a

valiantly

with
sweeping
intensely
emphatic
gestures

out
eloquently
his
jaw
thrust
forward
his
eyes
glaring

shone
like
carbuncles
with
a
swift
changing
glitter
always
fastened
upon
patsy

the
two
peacemakers
were
perspiring
and
in
despair

of

blurted

there
began
then
some
rapid
action
the
patience
of
men
is
not
an
eternal
thing
it
began
to
look
as
if
it
would
at
last
be
a
fight
with
six
corners
to
it
the
faces
of
the
men
were
shining
red
with
anger
they
jostled
each
other
defiantly
and
almost
every
one
blazed
out
at
three
or
four
of
the
others
the
had
given
up
protesting
he
swore
for
a
time
and
banged
his
glasses
then
he
jumped
the
bar
and
ran
out
of
the
saloon
cursing
sullenly
when
he
came
back
with
a
policeman
patsy
and
the
cuban
were
preparing
to
depart
together
patsy
was
delivering
his
last
oration
i

the
policeman
said
sharply

he
had
a
distinctly
business
air
the
little
cuban
stepped
forward
calmly
it
is
none
of
your
business
the
policeman
flushed
to
his
ears
what
one
man
touched
the
other
on
the
sleeve
here
the
time
to
skip
he
whispered
they
halted
a
block
away
from
the
saloon
and
watched
the
policeman
pull
the
cuban
through
the
door
there
was
a
minute
of
scuffle
on
the
sidewalk
and
into
this
deserted
street
at
midnight
fifty
people
appeared
at
once
as
if
from
the
sky
to
watch
it
at
last
the
three
cherry
hill
men
came
from
the
saloon
and
swaggered
with
all
their
old
valour
toward
the
peacemakers
ah
said
patsy
to
them
he
was
so
hot
talkin
about
this
duel
business
but
i
would
a
great
scrap
an
do
yeh
forgit
it
for
patsy
was
not
as
wise
as
seven
owls
but
his
courage
could
throw
a
shadow
as
long
as
the
steeple
of
a
cathedral
an
ominous
baby
a
baby
was
wandering
in
a
strange
country
he
was
a
tattered
child
with
a
frowsled
wealth
of
yellow
hair
his
dress
of
a
checked
stuff
was
soiled
and
showed
the
marks
of
many
conflicts
like
the
of
a
warrior
his
knees
shone
above
wrinkled
stockings
which
he
pulled
up
occasionally
with
an
impatient
movement
when
they
entangled
his
feet
from
a
gaping
shoe
there
appeared
an
array
of
tiny
toes
he
was
toddling
along
an
avenue
between
rows
of
stolid
brown
houses
he
went
slowly
with
a
look
of
absorbed
interest
on
his
small
flushed
face
his
blue
eyes
stared
curiously
carriages
went
with
a
musical
rumble
over
the
smooth
asphalt
a
man
with
a
chrysanthemum
was
going
up
steps
two
nursery
maids
chatted
as
they
walked
slowly
while
their
charges
hobnobbed
amiably
between
perambulators
a
truck
wagon
roared
thunderously
in
the
distance
the
child
from
the
poor
district
made
his
way
along
the
brown
street
filled
with
dull
grey
shadows
high
up
near
the
roofs
glancing
changed
cornices
to
blazing
gold
and
silvered
the
fronts
of
windows
the
wandering
baby
stopped
and
stared
at
the
two
children
laughing
and
playing
in
their
carriages
among
the
heaps
of
rugs
and
cushions
he
braced
his
legs
apart
in
an
attitude
of
earnest
attention
his
lower
jaw
fell
and
disclosed
his
small
even
teeth
as
they
moved
on
he
followed
the
carriages
with
awe
in
his
face
as
if
contemplating
a
pageant
once
one
of
the
babies
with
twittering
laughter
shook
a
gorgeous
rattle
at
him
he
smiled
jovially
in
return
finally
a
nursery
maid
ceased
conversation
and
turning
made
a
gesture
of
annoyance
go
little
boy
she
said
to
him
go
you
all
dirty
he
gazed
at
her
with
infant
tranquillity
for
a
moment
and
then
went
slowly
off
dragging
behind
him
a
bit
of
rope
he
had
acquired
in
another
street
he
continued
to
investigate
the
new
scenes
the
people
and
houses
struck
him
with
interest
as
would
flowers
and
trees
passengers
had
to
avoid
the
small
absorbed
figure
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
they
glanced
at
the
intent
baby
face
covered
with
scratches
and
dust
as
with
scars
and
with
powder
smoke
after
a
time
the
wanderer
discovered
upon
the
pavement
a
pretty
child
in
fine
clothes
playing
with
a
toy
it
was
a
tiny
painted
brilliantly
in
crimson
and
gold
the
wheels
rattled
as
its
small
owner
dragged
it
uproariously
about
by
means
of
a
string
the
babe
with
his
bit
of
rope
trailing
behind
him
paused
and
regarded
the
child
and
the
toy
for
a
long
while
he
remained
motionless
save
for
his
eyes
which
followed
all
movements
of
the
glittering
thing
the
owner
paid
no
attention
to
the
spectator
but
continued
his
joyous
imitations
of
phases
of
the
career
of
a
his
gleeful
baby
laugh
rang
against
the
calm
fronts
of
the
houses
after
a
little
the
wandering
baby
began
quietly
to
sidle
nearer
his
bit
of
rope
now
forgotten
dropped
at
his
feet
he
removed
his
eyes
from
the
toy
and
glanced
expectantly
at
the
other
child
say
he
breathed
softly
the
owner
of
the
toy
was
running
down
the
walk
at
top
speed
his
tongue
was
clanging
like
a
bell
and
his
legs
were
galloping
he
did
not
look
around
at
the
coaxing
call
from
the
small
tattered
figure
on
the
curb
the
wandering
baby
approached
still
nearer
and
presently
spoke
again
say
he
murmured
le
me
play
wif
it
the
other
child
interrupted
some
shrill
tootings
he
bended
his
head
and
spoke
disdainfully
over
his
shoulder
no
he
said
the
wanderer
retreated
to
the
curb
he
failed
to
notice
the
bit
of
rope
once
treasured
his
eyes
followed
as
before
the
winding
course
of
the
engine
and
his
tender
mouth
twitched
say
he
ventured
at
last
is
dat
yours
yes
said
the
other
tilting
his
round
chin
he
drew
his
property
suddenly
behind
him
as
if
it
were
menaced
yes
he
repeated
mine
well
le
me
play
wif
it
said
the
wandering
baby
with
a
trembling
note
of
desire
in
his
voice
no
cried
the
pretty
child
with
determined
lips
it
mine
my
buyed
it
well
ta
i
play
wif
it
his
voice
was
a
sob
he
stretched
forth
little
covetous
hands
no
the
pretty
child
continued
to
repeat
no
it
mine
well
i
want
to
play
wif
it
wailed
the
other
a
sudden
fierce
frown
mantled
his
baby
face
he
clenched
his
fat
hands
and
advanced
with
a
formidable
gesture
he
looked
some
wee
battler
in
a
war
it
mine
it
mine
cried
the
pretty
child
his
voice
in
the
treble
of
outraged
rights
i
want
it
roared
the
wanderer
it
mine
it
mine
i
want
it
it
mine
the
pretty
child
retreated
to
the
fence
and
there
paused
at
bay
he
protected
his
property
with
outstretched
arms
the
small
vandal
made
a
charge
there
was
a
short
scuffle
at
the
fence
each
grasped
the
string
to
the
toy
and
tugged
their
faces
were
wrinkled
with
baby
rage
the
verge
of
tears
finally
the
child
in
tatters
gave
a
supreme
tug
and
wrenched
the
string
from
the
other
hands
he
set
off
rapidly
down
the
street
bearing
the
toy
in
his
arms
he
was
weeping
with
the
air
of
a
wronged
one
who
has
at
last
succeeded
in
achieving
his
rights
the
other
baby
was
squalling
lustily
he
seemed
quite
helpless
he
rung
his
chubby
hands
and
railed
after
the
small
barbarian
had
got
some
distance
away
he
paused
and
regarded
his
booty
his
little
form
curved
with
pride
a
soft
gleeful
smile
loomed
through
the
storm
of
tears
with
great
care
he
prepared
the
toy
for
travelling
he
stopped
a
moment
on
a
corner
and
gazed
at
the
pretty
child
whose
small
figure
was
quivering
with
sobs
as
the
latter
began
to
show
signs
of
beginning
pursuit
the
little
vandal
turned
and
vanished
down
a
dark
side
street
as
into
a
cavern
a
great
mistake
an
italian
kept
a
on
a
corner
where
he
had
good
aim
at
the
people
who
came
down
from
the
elevated
station
and
at
those
who
went
along
two
thronged
streets
he
sat
most
of
the
day
in
a
backless
chair
that
was
placed
strategically
there
was
a
babe
living
hard
by
up
five
flights
of
stairs
who
regarded
this
italian
as
a
tremendous
being
the
babe
had
investigated
this
it
had
thrilled
him
as
few
things
he
had
met
with
in
his
travels
had
thrilled
him
the
sweets
of
the
world
had
laid
there
in
dazzling
rows
tumbled
in
luxurious
heaps
when
he
gazed
at
this
italian
seated
amid
such
splendid
treasures
his
lower
lip
hung
low
and
his
eyes
raised
to
the
vendor
face
were
filled
with
deep
respect
worship
as
if
he
saw
omnipotence
the
babe
came
often
to
this
corner
he
hovered
about
the
stand
and
watched
each
detail
of
the
business
he
was
fascinated
by
the
tranquillity
of
the
vendor
the
majesty
of
power
and
possession
at
times
he
was
so
engrossed
in
his
contemplation
that
people
hurrying
had
to
use
care
to
avoid
bumping
him
down
he
had
never
ventured
very
near
to
the
stand
it
was
his
habit
to
hang
warily
about
the
curb
even
there
he
resembled
a
babe
who
looks
unbidden
at
a
feast
of
gods
one
day
however
as
the
baby
was
thus
staring
the
vendor
arose
and
going
along
the
front
of
the
stand
began
to
polish
oranges
with
a
red
pocket
handkerchief
the
breathless
spectator
moved
across
the
side
walk
until
his
small
face
almost
touched
the
vendor
sleeve
his
fingers
were
gripped
in
a
fold
of
his
dress
at
last
the
italian
finished
with
the
oranges
and
returned
to
his
chair
he
drew
a
newspaper
printed
in
his
language
from
behind
a
bunch
of
bananas
he
settled
himself
in
a
comfortable
position
and
began
to
glare
savagely
at
the
print
the
babe
was
left
face
to
face
with
the
massed
joys
of
the
world
for
a
time
he
was
a
simple
worshipper
at
this
golden
shrine
then
tumultuous
desires
began
to
shake
him
his
dreams
were
of
conquest
his
lips
moved
presently
into
his
head
there
came
a
little
plan
he
sidled
nearer
throwing
swift
and
cunning
glances
at
the
italian
he
strove
to
maintain
his
conventional
manner
but
the
whole
plot
was
written
upon
his
countenance
at
last
he
had
come
near
enough
to
touch
the
fruit
from
the
tattered
skirt
came
slowly
his
small
dirty
hand
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
the
vendor
his
features
were
set
save
for
the
under
lip
which
had
a
faint
fluttering
movement
the
hand
went
forward
elevated
trains
thundered
to
the
station
and
the
stairway
poured
people
upon
the
sidewalks
there
was
a
deep
sea
roar
from
feet
and
wheels
going
ceaselessly
none
seemed
to
perceive
the
babe
engaged
in
a
great
venture
the
italian
turned
his
paper
sudden
panic
smote
the
babe
his
hand
dropped
and
he
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
dismay
he
remained
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
vendor
there
was
evidently
a
great
debate
in
his
mind
his
infant
intellect
had
defined
this
italian
the
latter
was
undoubtedly
a
man
who
would
eat
babes
that
provoked
him
and
the
alarm
in
the
babe
when
this
monarch
had
turned
his
newspaper
brought
vividly
before
him
the
consequences
if
he
were
detected
but
at
this
moment
the
vendor
gave
a
blissful
grunt
and
tilting
his
chair
against
a
wall
closed
his
eyes
his
paper
dropped
unheeded
the
babe
ceased
his
scrutiny
and
again
raised
his
hand
it
was
moved
with
supreme
caution
toward
the
fruit
the
fingers
were
bent
in
the
manner
of
great
greed
once
he
stopped
and
chattered
convulsively
because
the
vendor
moved
in
his
sleep
the
babe
with
his
eyes
still
upon
the
italian
again
put
forth
his
hand
and
the
rapacious
fingers
closed
over
a
round
bulb
and
it
was
written
that
the
italian
should
at
this
moment
open
his
eyes
he
glared
at
the
babe
a
fierce
question
thereupon
the
babe
thrust
the
round
bulb
behind
him
and
with
a
face
expressive
of
the
deepest
guilt
began
a
wild
but
elaborate
series
of
gestures
declaring
his
innocence
the
italian
howled
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
with
three
steps
overtook
the
babe
he
whirled
him
fiercely
and
took
from
the
little
fingers
a
lemon
an
eloquence
of
grief
the
windows
were
high
and
saintly
of
the
shape
that
is
found
in
churches
from
time
to
time
a
policeman
at
the
door
spoke
sharply
to
some
incoming
person
take
your
hat
off
he
displayed
in
his
voice
the
horror
of
a
priest
when
the
sanctity
of
a
chapel
is
defied
or
forgotten
the
was
crowded
with
people
who
sloped
back
comfortably
in
their
chairs
regarding
with
undeviating
glances
the
procession
and
its
attendant
and
guardian
policemen
that
moved
slowly
inside
the
railing
all
persons
connected
with
a
case
went
close
to
the
magistrate
desk
before
a
word
was
spoken
in
the
matter
and
then
their
voices
were
toned
to
the
ordinary
talking
strength
the
crowd
in
the
could
not
hear
a
sentence
they
could
merely
see
shifting
figures
men
that
gestured
quietly
women
that
sometimes
raised
an
eager
eloquent
arm
they
could
not
always
see
the
judge
although
they
were
able
to
estimate
his
location
by
the
tall
stands
surmounted
by
white
globes
that
were
at
either
hand
of
him
and
so
those
who
had
come
for
curiosity
sweet
sake
wore
an
air
of
being
in
wait
for
a
cry
of
anguish
some
loud
painful
protestation
that
would
bring
the
proper
thrill
to
their
jaded
nerves
wires
that
refused
to
vibrate
for
ordinary
affairs
inside
the
railing
the
court
officers
shuffled
the
various
groups
with
speed
and
skill
and
behind
the
desk
the
magistrate
patiently
toiled
his
way
through
mazes
of
wonderful
testimony
in
a
corner
of
this
space
devoted
to
those
who
had
business
before
the
judge
an
officer
in
plain
clothes
stood
with
a
girl
that
wept
constantly
none
seemed
to
notice
the
girl
and
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
be
noticed
if
the
curious
in
the
body
of
the
were
not
interested
in
the
devastation
which
tears
bring
upon
some
complexions
her
tears
seemed
to
burn
like
acid
and
they
left
fierce
pink
marks
on
her
face
occasionally
the
girl
looked
across
the
room
where
two
young
women
and
a
man
stood
waiting
with
the
serenity
of
people
who
are
not
concerned
as
to
the
interior
fittings
of
a
jail
the
business
of
the
court
progressed
and
presently
the
girl
the
officer
and
the
contingent
stood
before
the
judge
thereupon
two
lawyers
engaged
in
some
preliminary
which
were
endured
generally
in
silence
the
girl
it
appeared
was
accused
of
stealing
fifty
dollars
worth
of
silk
clothing
from
the
room
of
one
of
the
women
she
had
been
a
servant
in
the
house
in
a
clear
way
and
with
none
of
the
ferocity
that
an
accuser
often
exhibits
in
a
calmly
and
moderately
the
two
young
women
gave
their
testimony
behind
them
stood
their
escort
always
mute
his
part
evidently
was
to
furnish
the
dignity
and
he
furnished
it
heavily
almost
massively
when
they
had
finished
the
girl
told
her
part
she
had
full
almost
afric
lips
and
they
had
turned
quite
white
the
lawyer
for
the
others
asked
some
questions
which
he
did
be
it
said
in
passing
with
the
air
of
a
man
throwing
at
a
stone
house
it
was
a
short
case
and
soon
finished
at
the
end
of
it
the
judge
said
that
considering
the
evidence
he
would
have
to
commit
the
girl
for
trial
instantly
the
court
officer
began
to
clear
the
way
for
the
next
case
the
women
and
their
escort
turned
one
way
and
the
girl
turned
another
toward
a
door
with
an
austere
arch
leading
into
a
passage
then
it
was
that
a
great
cry
rang
through
the
the
cry
of
this
girl
who
believed
that
she
was
lost
the
loungers
many
of
them
underwent
a
spasmodic
movement
as
if
they
had
been
knived
the
court
officers
rallied
quickly
the
girl
fell
back
opportunely
for
the
arms
of
one
of
them
and
her
wild
heels
clicked
twice
on
the
floor
i
am
innocent
oh
i
am
innocent
people
pity
those
who
need
none
and
the
guilty
sob
alone
but
innocent
or
guilty
this
girl
scream
described
such
a
profound
depth
of
woe
it
was
so
graphic
of
grief
that
it
slit
with
a
dagger
sweep
the
curtain
of
and
disclosed
the
spectre
that
sat
in
the
young
girl
heart
so
plainly
in
so
universal
a
tone
of
the
mind
that
a
man
heard
expressed
some
midnight
terror
of
his
own
thought
the
cries
died
away
down
the
passage
a
leaned
one
arm
composedly
on
the
railing
and
down
below
him
stood
an
aged
almost
toothless
wanderer
tottering
and
grinning
plase
yer
honer
said
the
old
man
as
the
time
arrived
for
him
to
speak
if
ye
lave
me
go
this
time
i
niver
been
dhrunk
befoor
sir
a
court
officer
lifted
his
hand
to
hide
a
smile
the
auction
some
said
that
ferguson
gave
up
sailoring
because
he
was
tired
of
the
sea
some
said
that
it
was
because
he
loved
a
woman
in
truth
it
was
because
he
was
tired
of
the
sea
and
because
he
loved
a
woman
he
saw
the
woman
once
and
immediately
she
became
for
him
the
symbol
of
all
things
unconnected
with
the
sea
he
did
not
trouble
to
look
again
at
the
grey
old
goddess
the
muttering
slave
of
the
moon
her
splendours
her
treacheries
her
smiles
her
rages
her
vanities
were
no
longer
on
his
mind
he
took
heels
after
a
little
human
being
and
the
woman
made
his
thought
spin
at
all
times
like
a
top
whereas
the
ocean
had
only
made
him
think
when
he
was
on
watch
he
developed
a
grin
for
the
power
of
the
sea
and
in
derision
he
wanted
to
sell
the
red
and
green
parrot
which
had
sailed
four
voyages
with
him
the
woman
however
had
a
sentiment
concerning
the
plumage
and
she
commanded
ferguson
to
keep
it
in
order
as
it
happened
that
she
might
forget
to
put
food
in
its
cage
the
parrot
did
not
attend
the
wedding
it
stayed
at
home
and
blasphemed
at
a
stock
of
furniture
bought
on
the
installment
plan
and
arrayed
for
the
reception
of
the
bride
and
groom
as
a
sailor
ferguson
had
suffered
the
acute
hankering
for
port
and
being
now
always
in
port
he
tried
to
force
life
to
become
an
endless
picnic
he
was
not
an
example
of
diligent
and
peaceful
citizenship
ablution
became
difficult
in
the
little
apartment
because
ferguson
kept
the
filled
with
ice
and
bottles
of
beer
and
so
finally
the
dealer
in
furniture
agreed
to
auction
the
household
goods
on
commission
owing
to
an
exceedingly
liberal
definition
of
a
term
the
parrot
and
cage
were
included
on
the
level
cried
the
parrot
on
the
level
on
the
level
on
the
level
on
the
way
to
the
sale
ferguson
wife
spoke
hopefully
you
tell
jim
she
said
perhaps
some
of
will
get
to
biddin
and
we
might
get
almost
as
much
as
we
paid
for
the
things
the
auction
room
was
in
a
cellar
it
was
crowded
with
people
and
with
house
furniture
so
that
as
the
auctioneer
assistant
moved
from
one
piece
to
another
he
caused
a
great
shuffling
there
was
an
astounding
number
of
old
women
in
curious
bonnets
the
rickety
stairway
was
thronged
with
men
who
wished
to
smoke
and
be
free
from
the
old
women
two
lamps
made
all
the
faces
appear
yellow
as
parchment
incidentally
they
could
impart
a
lustre
of
value
to
very
poor
furniture
the
auctioneer
was
a
fat
individual
who
seemed
also
to
be
a
great
bully
the
assistant
was
the
most
imperturbable
of
beings
moving
with
the
dignity
of
an
image
on
rollers
as
the
fergusons
forced
their
way
down
the
the
assistant
roared

the
parrot
muffled
somewhere
among
furniture
and
carpets
on
the
level
on
the
level
every
one
tittered
ferguson
had
turned
pale
and
gripped
her
husband
arm
jim
did
you
hear
the
bureau
four
dollars
ferguson
glowered
at
her
with
the
swift
brutality
of
a
man
afraid
of
a
scene
shut
up
ca
you
ferguson
took
a
seat
upon
the
steps
and
hidden
there
by
the
thick
ranks
of
men
she
began
to
softly
sob
through
her
tears
appeared
the
yellowish
mist
of
the
lamplight
streaming
about
the
monstrous
shadows
of
the
spectators
from
time
to
time
these
latter
whispered
eagerly
see
that
went
cheap
in
fact
when
anything
was
bought
at
a
particularly
low
price
a
murmur
of
admiration
arose
for
the
successful
bidder
the
bedstead
was
sold
for
two
dollars
the
mattresses
and
springs
for
one
dollar
and
sixty
cents
this
figure
seemed
to
go
through
the
woman
heart
there
was
derision
in
the
sound
of
it
she
bowed
her
head
in
her
hands
oh
god
a
oh
god
a
the
parrot
was
evidently
under
heaps
of
carpet
but
the
dauntless
bird
still
raised
the
cry
on
the
level
some
of
the
men
near
ferguson
moved
timidly
away
upon
hearing
her
low
sobs
they
perfectly
understood
that
a
woman
in
tears
is
formidable
the
shrill
voice
went
like
a
hammer
beat
and
beat
upon
the
heart
an
odour
of
varnish
of
the
dust
of
old
carpets
assailed
her
and
seemed
to
possess
a
sinister
meaning
the
golden
haze
from
the
two
lamps
was
an
atmosphere
of
shame
sorrow
greed
but
it
was
when
the
parrot
called
that
a
terror
of
the
place
and
of
the
eyes
of
the
people
arose
in
her
so
strongly
that
she
could
not
have
lifted
her
head
any
more
than
if
her
neck
had
been
of
iron
at
last
came
the
parrot
turn
the
assistant
fumbled
until
he
found
the
ring
of
the
cage
and
the
bird
was
drawn
into
view
it
adjusted
its
feathers
calmly
and
cast
a
rolling
wicked
eye
over
the
crowd
oh
the
good
ship
sarah
sailed
the
seas
and
the
wind
it
blew
all
day
this
was
the
part
of
a
ballad
which
ferguson
had
tried
to
teach
it
with
a
singular
audacity
and
scorn
the
parrot
bawled
these
lines
at
the
auctioneer
as
if
it
considered
them
to
bear
some
particular
insult
the
throng
in
the
cellar
burst
into
laughter
the
auctioneer
attempted
to
start
the
bidding
and
the
parrot
interrupted
with
a
repetition
of
the
lines
it
swaggered
to
and
fro
on
its
perch
and
gazed
at
the
faces
of
the
crowd
with
so
much
rowdy
understanding
and
derision
that
even
the
auctioneer
could
not
confront
it
the
auction
was
brought
to
a
halt
a
wild
hilarity
developed
and
every
one
gave
jeering
advice
ferguson
looked
down
at
his
wife
and
groaned
she
had
cowered
against
the
wall
hiding
her
face
he
touched
her
shoulder
and
she
arose
they
sneaked
softly
up
the
stairs
with
heads
bowed
out
in
the
street
ferguson
gripped
his
fists
and
said
oh
but
would
i
like
to
strangle
it
his
wife
cried
in
a
voice
of
wild
grief
it
it
m
made
us
a
in
in
front
of
all
that
crowd
for
the
auctioning
of
their
household
goods
the
sale
of
their
home
this
financial
calamity
lost
its
power
in
the
presence
of
the
social
shame
contained
in
a
crowd
laughter
the
pace
of
youth
i
stimson
stood
in
a
corner
and
glowered
he
was
a
fierce
man
and
had
indomitable
whiskers
albeit
he
was
very
small
that
young
tarrier
he
whispered
to
himself
he
wants
to
quit
eyes
at
lizzie
this
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
first
thing
you
know
he
get
fired
his
brow
creased
in
a
frown
he
strode
over
to
the
huge
open
doors
and
looked
at
a
sign
stimson
mammoth
it
read
and
the
glory
of
it
was
great
stimson
stood
and
contemplated
the
sign
it
was
an
enormous
affair
the
letters
were
as
large
as
men
the
glow
of
it
the
grandeur
of
it
was
very
apparent
to
stimson
at
the
end
of
his
contemplation
he
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
determinedly
no
no
he
muttered
this
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
first
thing
you
know
he
get
fired
a
soft
booming
sound
of
surf
mingled
with
the
cries
of
bathers
came
from
the
beach
there
was
a
vista
of
sand
and
sky
and
sea
that
drew
to
a
mystic
point
far
away
in
the
northward
in
the
mighty
angle
a
girl
in
a
red
dress
was
crawling
slowly
like
some
kind
of
a
spider
on
the
fabric
of
nature
a
few
flags
hung
lazily
above
where
the
were
marshalled
in
compact
squares
upon
the
edge
of
the
sea
stood
a
ship
with
its
shadowy
sails
painted
dimly
upon
the
sky
and
high
overhead
in
the
still
air
a
great
hawk
swung
and
drifted
slowly
within
the
there
was
a
whirling
circle
of
ornamental
lions
giraffes
camels
ponies
goats
glittering
with
varnish
and
metal
that
caught
swift
reflections
from
windows
high
above
them
with
stiff
wooden
legs
they
swept
on
in
a
race
while
a
great
orchestrion
clamoured
in
wild
speed
the
summer
sunlight
sprinkled
its
gold
upon
the
garnet
canopies
carried
by
the
tireless
racers
and
upon
all
the
devices
of
decoration
that
made
stimson
machine
magnificent
and
famous
a
host
of
laughing
children
bestrode
the
animals
bending
forward
like
charging
cavalrymen
and
shaking
reins
and
whooping
in
glee
at
intervals
they
leaned
out
perilously
to
clutch
at
iron
rings
that
were
tendered
to
them
by
a
long
wooden
arm
at
the
intense
moment
before
the
swift
grab
for
the
rings
one
could
see
their
little
nervous
bodies
quiver
with
eagerness
the
laughter
rang
shrill
and
excited
down
in
the
long
rows
of
benches
crowds
of
people
sat
watching
the
game
while
occasionally
a
father
might
arise
and
go
near
to
shout
encouragement
cautionary
commands
or
applause
at
his
flying
offspring
frequently
mothers
called
out
be
careful
georgie
the
orchestrion
bellowed
and
thundered
on
its
platform
filling
the
ears
with
its
long
monotonous
song
over
in
a
corner
a
man
in
a
white
apron
and
behind
a
counter
roared
above
the
tumult
pop
corn
pop
corn
a
young
man
stood
upon
a
small
raised
platform
erected
in
a
manner
of
a
pulpit
and
just
without
the
line
of
the
circling
figures
it
was
his
duty
to
manipulate
the
wooden
arm
and
affix
the
rings
when
all
were
gone
into
the
hands
of
the
triumphant
children
he
held
forth
a
basket
into
which
they
returned
all
save
the
coveted
brass
one
which
meant
another
ride
free
and
made
the
holder
very
illustrious
the
young
man
stood
all
day
upon
his
narrow
platform
affixing
rings
or
holding
forth
the
basket
he
was
a
sort
of
general
squire
in
these
lists
of
childhood
he
was
very
busy
and
yet
stimson
the
astute
had
noticed
that
the
young
man
frequently
found
time
to
twist
about
on
his
platform
and
smile
at
a
girl
who
shyly
sold
tickets
behind
a
silvered
netting
this
indeed
was
the
great
reason
of
stimson
glowering
the
young
man
upon
the
raised
platform
had
no
manner
of
licence
to
smile
at
the
girl
behind
the
silvered
netting
it
was
a
most
gigantic
insolence
stimson
was
amazed
at
it
by
jiminy
he
said
to
himself
again
that
fellow
is
smiling
at
my
daughter
even
in
this
tone
of
great
wrath
it
could
be
discerned
that
stimson
was
filled
with
wonder
that
any
youth
should
dare
smile
at
the
daughter
in
the
presence
of
the
august
father
often
the
girl
peered
between
the
shining
wires
and
upon
being
detected
by
the
young
man
she
usually
turned
her
head
away
quickly
to
prove
to
him
that
she
was
not
interested
at
other
times
however
her
eyes
seemed
filled
with
a
tender
fear
lest
he
should
fall
from
that
exceedingly
dangerous
platform
as
for
the
young
man
it
was
plain
that
these
glances
filled
him
with
valour
and
he
stood
carelessly
upon
his
perch
as
if
he
deemed
it
of
no
consequence
that
he
might
fall
from
it
in
all
the
complexities
of
his
daily
life
and
duties
he
found
opportunity
to
gaze
ardently
at
the
vision
behind
the
netting
this
silent
courtship
was
conducted
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
who
thronged
about
the
bright
machine
the
swift
eloquent
glances
of
the
young
man
went
noiselessly
and
unseen
with
their
message
there
had
finally
become
established
between
the
two
in
this
manner
a
subtle
understanding
and
companionship
they
communicated
accurately
all
that
they
felt
the
boy
told
his
love
his
reverence
his
hope
in
the
changes
of
the
future
the
girl
told
him
that
she
loved
him
that
she
did
not
love
him
that
she
did
not
know
if
she
loved
him
that
she
loved
him
sometimes
a
little
sign
saying
cashier
in
gold
letters
and
hanging
upon
the
silvered
netting
got
directly
in
range
and
interfered
with
the
tender
message
the
love
affair
had
not
continued
without
anger
unhappiness
despair
the
girl
had
once
smiled
brightly
upon
a
youth
who
came
to
buy
some
tickets
for
his
little
sister
and
the
young
man
upon
the
platform
observing
this
smile
had
been
filled
with
gloomy
rage
he
stood
like
a
dark
statue
of
vengeance
upon
his
pedestal
and
thrust
out
the
basket
to
the
children
with
a
gesture
that
was
full
of
scorn
for
their
hollow
happiness
for
their
insecure
and
temporary
joy
for
five
hours
he
did
not
once
look
at
the
girl
when
she
was
looking
at
him
he
was
going
to
crush
her
with
his
indifference
he
was
going
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
never
been
serious
however
when
he
narrowly
observed
her
in
secret
he
discovered
that
she
seemed
more
blythe
than
was
usual
with
her
when
he
found
that
his
apparent
indifference
had
not
crushed
her
he
suffered
greatly
she
did
not
love
him
he
concluded
if
she
had
loved
him
she
would
have
been
crushed
for
two
days
he
lived
a
miserable
existence
upon
his
high
perch
he
consoled
himself
by
thinking
of
how
unhappy
he
was
and
by
swift
furtive
glances
at
the
loved
face
at
any
rate
he
was
in
her
presence
and
he
could
get
a
good
view
from
his
perch
when
there
was
no
interference
by
the
little
sign
cashier
but
suddenly
swiftly
these
clouds
vanished
and
under
the
imperial
blue
sky
of
the
restored
confidence
they
dwelt
in
peace
a
peace
that
was
satisfaction
a
peace
that
like
a
babe
put
its
trust
in
the
treachery
of
the
future
this
confidence
endured
until
the
next
day
when
she
for
an
unknown
cause
suddenly
refused
to
look
at
him
mechanically
he
continued
his
task
his
brain
dazed
a
tortured
victim
of
doubt
fear
suspicion
with
his
eyes
he
supplicated
her
to
telegraph
an
explanation
she
replied
with
a
stony
glance
that
froze
his
blood
there
was
a
great
difference
in
their
respective
reasons
for
becoming
angry
his
were
always
foolish
but
apparent
plain
as
the
moon
hers
were
subtle
feminine
as
incomprehensible
as
the
stars
as
mysterious
as
the
shadows
at
night
they
fell
and
soared
and
soared
and
fell
in
this
manner
until
they
knew
that
to
live
without
each
other
would
be
a
wandering
in
deserts
they
had
grown
so
intent
upon
the
uncertainties
the
variations
the
guessings
of
their
affair
that
the
world
had
become
but
a
huge
immaterial
background
in
time
of
peace
their
smiles
were
soft
and
prayerful
caresses
confided
to
the
air
in
time
of
war
their
youthful
hearts
capable
of
profound
agony
were
wrung
by
the
intricate
emotions
of
doubt
they
were
the
victims
of
the
dread
angel
of
affectionate
speculation
that
forces
the
brain
endlessly
on
roads
that
lead
nowhere
at
night
the
problem
of
whether
she
loved
him
confronted
the
young
man
like
a
spectre
looming
as
high
as
a
hill
and
telling
him
not
to
delude
himself
upon
the
following
day
this
battle
of
the
night
displayed
itself
in
the
renewed
fervour
of
his
glances
and
in
their
increased
number
whenever
he
thought
he
could
detect
that
she
too
was
suffering
he
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
but
there
came
a
time
when
the
young
man
looked
back
upon
these
contortions
with
contempt
he
believed
then
that
he
had
imagined
his
pain
this
came
about
when
the
redoubtable
stimson
marched
forward
to
participate
this
has
got
to
stop
stimson
had
said
to
himself
as
he
stood
and
watched
them
they
had
grown
careless
of
the
light
world
that
clattered
about
them
they
were
become
so
engrossed
in
their
personal
drama
that
the
language
of
their
eyes
was
almost
as
obvious
as
gestures
and
stimson
through
his
keenness
his
wonderful
infallible
penetration
suddenly
came
into
possession
of
these
obvious
facts
well
of
all
the
nerves
he
said
regarding
with
a
new
interest
the
young
man
upon
the
perch
he
was
a
resolute
man
he
never
hesitated
to
grapple
with
a
crisis
he
decided
to
overturn
everything
at
once
for
although
small
he
was
very
fierce
and
impetuous
he
resolved
to
crush
this
dreaming
he
strode
over
to
the
silvered
netting
say
you
want
to
quit
your
everlasting
grinning
at
that
idiot
he
said
grimly
the
girl
cast
down
her
eyes
and
made
a
little
heap
of
quarters
into
a
stack
she
was
unable
to
withstand
the
terrible
scrutiny
of
her
small
and
fierce
father
stimson
turned
from
his
daughter
and
went
to
a
spot
beneath
the
platform
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
young
man
and
said
i
been
speakin
to
lizzie
you
better
attend
strictly
to
your
own
business
or
there
be
a
new
man
here
next
week
it
was
as
if
he
had
blazed
away
with
a
the
young
man
reeled
upon
his
perch
at
last
he
in
a
measure
regained
his
composure
and
managed
to
stammer
a
all
right
sir
he
knew
that
denials
would
be
futile
with
the
terrible
stimson
he
agitatedly
began
to
rattle
the
rings
in
the
basket
and
pretend
that
he
was
obliged
to
count
them
or
inspect
them
in
some
way
he
too
was
unable
to
face
the
great
stimson
for
a
moment
stimson
stood
in
fine
satisfaction
and
gloated
over
the
effect
of
his
threat
i
fixed
them
he
said
complacently
and
went
out
to
smoke
a
cigar
and
revel
in
himself
through
his
mind
went
the
proud
reflection
that
people
who
came
in
contact
with
his
granite
will
usually
ended
in
quick
and
abject
submission
ii
one
evening
a
week
after
stimson
had
indulged
in
the
proud
reflection
that
people
who
came
in
contact
with
his
granite
will
usually
ended
in
quick
and
abject
submission
a
young
feminine
friend
of
the
girl
behind
the
silvered
netting
came
to
her
there
and
asked
her
to
walk
on
the
beach
after
stimson
mammoth
was
closed
for
the
night
the
girl
assented
with
a
nod
the
young
man
upon
the
perch
holding
the
rings
saw
this
nod
and
judged
its
meaning
into
his
mind
came
an
idea
of
defeating
the
watchfulness
of
the
redoubtable
stimson
when
the
was
closed
and
the
two
girls
started
for
the
beach
he
wandered
off
aimlessly
in
another
direction
but
he
kept
them
in
view
and
as
soon
as
he
was
assured
that
he
had
escaped
the
vigilance
of
stimson
he
followed
them
the
electric
lights
on
the
beach
made
a
broad
band
of
tremoring
light
extending
parallel
to
the
sea
and
upon
the
wide
walk
there
slowly
paraded
a
great
crowd
intermingling
intertwining
sometimes
colliding
in
the
darkness
stretched
the
vast
purple
expanse
of
the
ocean
and
the
deep
indigo
sky
above
was
peopled
with
yellow
stars
occasionally
out
upon
the
water
a
whirling
mass
of
froth
suddenly
flashed
into
view
like
a
great
ghostly
robe
appearing
and
then
vanished
leaving
the
sea
in
its
darkness
from
whence
came
those
bass
tones
of
the
water
unknown
emotion
a
wind
cool
reminiscent
of
the
wave
wastes
made
the
women
hold
their
wraps
about
their
throats
and
caused
the
men
to
grip
the
rims
of
their
straw
hats
it
carried
the
noise
of
the
band
in
the
pavilion
in
gusts
sometimes
people
unable
to
hear
the
music
glanced
up
at
the
pavilion
and
were
reassured
upon
beholding
the
distant
leader
still
gesticulating
and
bobbing
and
the
other
members
of
the
band
with
their
lips
glued
to
their
instruments
high
in
the
sky
soared
an
unassuming
moon
faintly
silver
for
a
time
the
young
man
was
afraid
to
approach
the
two
girls
he
followed
them
at
a
distance
and
called
himself
a
coward
at
last
however
he
saw
them
stop
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
crowd
and
stand
silently
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
sea
when
he
came
to
where
they
stood
he
was
trembling
in
his
agitation
they
had
not
seen
him
lizzie
he
began
i
the
girl
wheeled
instantly
and
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
oh
frank
how
you
frightened
me
she
said
inevitably
well
you
know
i
i
he
stuttered
but
the
other
girl
was
one
of
those
beings
who
are
born
to
attend
at
tragedies
she
had
for
love
a
reverence
an
admiration
that
was
greater
the
more
that
she
contemplated
the
fact
that
she
knew
nothing
of
it
this
couple
with
their
emotions
awed
her
and
made
her
humbly
wish
that
she
might
be
destined
to
be
of
some
service
to
them
she
was
very
homely
when
the
young
man
faltered
before
them
she
in
her
sympathy
actually
the
crisis
and
felt
that
he
might
fall
dying
at
their
feet
shyly
but
with
courage
she
marched
to
the
rescue
wo
you
come
and
walk
on
the
beach
with
us
she
said
the
young
woman
gave
her
a
glance
of
deep
gratitude
which
was
not
without
the
patronage
which
a
man
in
his
condition
naturally
feels
for
one
who
pities
it
the
three
walked
on
finally
the
being
who
was
born
to
attend
at
this
tragedy
said
that
she
wished
to
sit
down
and
gaze
at
the
sea
alone
they
politely
urged
her
to
walk
on
with
them
but
she
was
obstinate
she
wished
to
gaze
at
the
sea
alone
the
young
man
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
be
her
friend
until
he
died
and
so
the
two
young
lovers
went
on
without
her
they
turned
once
to
look
at
her
jennie
awful
nice
said
the
girl
you
bet
she
is
replied
the
young
man
ardently
they
were
silent
for
a
little
time
at
last
the
girl
said
you
were
angry
at
me
yesterday
no
i
was
yes
you
were
too
you
would
look
at
me
once
all
day
no
i
was
angry
i
was
only
putting
on
though
she
had
of
course
known
it
this
confession
seemed
to
make
her
very
indignant
she
flashed
a
resentful
glance
at
him
oh
were
you
indeed
she
said
with
a
great
air
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
so
haughty
with
him
that
he
loved
her
to
madness
and
directly
this
poem
which
stuck
at
his
lips
came
forth
lamely
in
fragments
when
they
walked
back
toward
the
other
girl
and
saw
the
patience
of
her
attitude
their
hearts
swelled
in
a
patronizing
and
secondary
tenderness
for
her
they
were
very
happy
if
they
had
been
miserable
they
would
have
charged
this
fairy
scene
of
the
night
with
a
criminal
heartlessness
but
as
they
were
joyous
they
vaguely
wondered
how
the
purple
sea
the
yellow
stars
the
changing
crowds
under
the
electric
lights
could
be
so
phlegmatic
and
stolid
they
walked
home
by
the
way
and
out
upon
the
water
those
gay
paper
lanterns
flashing
fleeting
and
careering
sang
to
them
sang
a
chorus
of
red
and
violet
and
green
and
gold
a
song
of
mystic
bands
of
the
future
one
day
when
business
paused
during
a
dull
sultry
afternoon
stimson
went
up
town
upon
his
return
he
found
that
the
popcorn
man
from
his
stand
over
in
a
corner
was
keeping
an
eye
upon
the
cashier
cage
and
that
nobody
at
all
was
attending
to
the
wooden
arm
and
the
iron
rings
he
strode
forward
like
a
sergeant
of
grenadiers
where
in
thunder
is
lizzie
he
demanded
a
cloud
of
rage
in
his
eyes
the
popcorn
man
although
associated
long
with
stimson
had
never
got
over
being
dazed
they
they
gone
round
to
th
th
house
he
said
with
difficulty
as
if
he
had
just
been
stunned
whose
house
snapped
stimson
your
your
house
i
said
the
popcorn
man
stimson
marched
round
to
his
home
kingly
denunciations
surged
already
formulated
to
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
he
bided
the
moment
when
his
anger
could
fall
upon
the
heads
of
that
pair
of
children
he
found
his
wife
convulsive
and
in
tears
where
lizzie
and
then
she
burst
forth
oh
john
run
away
i
know
they
have
they
drove
by
here
not
three
minutes
ago
they
must
have
done
it
on
purpose
to
bid
me
for
lizzie
waved
her
hand
and
then
before
i
could
get
out
to
ask
where
they
were
going
or
what
frank
whipped
up
the
horse
stimson
gave
vent
to
a
dreadful
roar
get
my
revolver
get
a
hack
get
my
revolver
do
you
hear
what
the
devil
his
voice
became
incoherent
he
had
always
ordered
his
wife
about
as
if
she
were
a
battalion
of
infantry
and
despite
her
misery
the
training
of
years
forced
her
to
spring
mechanically
to
obey
but
suddenly
she
turned
to
him
with
a
shrill
appeal
oh
john
not
the
revolver
confound
it
let
go
of
me
he
roared
again
and
shook
her
from
him
he
ran
hatless
upon
the
street
there
were
a
multitude
of
hacks
at
the
summer
resort
but
it
was
ages
to
him
before
he
could
find
one
then
he
charged
it
like
a
bull
uptown
he
yelled
as
he
tumbled
into
the
rear
seat
the
hackman
thought
of
severed
arteries
his
galloping
horse
distanced
a
large
number
of
citizens
who
had
been
running
to
find
what
caused
such
contortions
by
the
little
hatless
man
it
chanced
as
the
bouncing
hack
went
along
near
the
lake
stimson
gazed
across
the
calm
grey
expanse
and
recognized
a
colour
in
a
bonnet
and
a
pose
of
a
head
a
buggy
was
travelling
along
a
highway
that
led
to
sorington
stimson
bellowed
there
there
there
they
are
in
that
buggy
the
hackman
became
inspired
with
the
full
knowledge
of
the
situation
he
struck
a
delirious
blow
with
the
whip
his
mouth
expanded
in
a
grin
of
excitement
and
joy
it
came
to
pass
that
this
old
vehicle
with
its
drowsy
horse
and
its
and
tranquil
driver
seemed
suddenly
to
awaken
to
become
animated
and
fleet
the
horse
ceased
to
ruminate
on
his
state
his
air
of
reflection
vanished
he
became
intent
upon
his
aged
legs
and
spread
them
in
quaint
and
ridiculous
devices
for
speed
the
driver
his
eyes
shining
sat
critically
in
his
seat
he
watched
each
motion
of
this
rattling
machine
down
before
him
he
resembled
an
engineer
he
used
the
whip
with
judgment
and
deliberation
as
the
engineer
would
have
used
coal
or
oil
the
horse
clacked
swiftly
upon
the
macadam
the
wheels
hummed
the
body
of
the
vehicle
wheezed
and
groaned
stimson
in
the
rear
seat
was
erect
in
that
impassive
attitude
that
comes
sometimes
to
the
furious
man
when
he
is
obliged
to
leave
the
battle
to
others
frequently
however
the
tempest
in
his
breast
came
to
his
face
and
he
howled
go
it
go
it
you
gaining
pound
thump
the
life
out
of
hit
hard
you
fool
his
hand
grasped
the
rod
that
supported
the
carriage
top
and
it
was
clenched
so
that
the
nails
were
faintly
blue
ahead
that
other
carriage
had
been
flying
with
speed
as
from
realization
of
the
menace
in
the
rear
it
bowled
away
rapidly
drawn
by
the
eager
spirit
of
a
young
and
modern
horse
stimson
could
see
the
bobbing
bobbing
that
little
pane
like
an
eye
was
a
derision
to
him
once
he
leaned
forward
and
bawled
angry
sentences
he
began
to
feel
impotent
his
whole
expedition
was
a
tottering
of
an
old
man
upon
a
trail
of
birds
a
sense
of
age
made
him
choke
again
with
wrath
that
other
vehicle
that
was
youth
with
youth
pace
it
was
with
the
hope
of
dreams
he
began
to
comprehend
those
two
children
ahead
of
him
and
he
knew
a
sudden
and
strange
awe
because
he
understood
the
power
of
their
young
blood
the
power
to
fly
strongly
into
the
future
and
feel
and
hope
again
even
at
that
time
when
his
bones
must
be
laid
in
the
earth
the
dust
rose
easily
from
the
hot
road
and
stifled
the
nostrils
of
stimson
the
highway
vanished
far
away
in
a
point
with
a
suggestion
of
intolerable
length
the
other
vehicle
was
becoming
so
small
that
stimson
could
no
longer
see
the
derisive
eye
at
last
the
hackman
drew
rein
to
his
horse
and
turned
to
look
at
stimson
no
use
i
guess
he
said
stimson
made
a
gesture
of
acquiescence
rage
despair
as
the
hackman
turned
his
dripping
horse
about
stimson
sank
back
with
the
astonishment
and
grief
of
a
man
who
has
been
defied
by
the
universe
he
had
been
in
a
great
perspiration
and
now
his
bald
head
felt
cool
and
uncomfortable
he
put
up
his
hand
with
a
sudden
recollection
that
he
had
forgotten
his
hat
at
last
he
made
a
gesture
it
meant
that
at
any
rate
he
was
not
responsible
a
detail
the
tiny
old
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
curious
little
black
bonnet
had
at
first
seemed
alarmed
at
the
sound
made
by
her
feet
upon
the
stone
pavements
but
later
she
forgot
about
it
for
she
suddenly
came
into
the
tempest
of
the
sixth
avenue
shopping
district
where
from
the
streams
of
people
and
vehicles
went
up
a
roar
like
that
from
headlong
mountain
torrents
she
seemed
then
like
a
chip
that
catches
recoils
turns
and
wheels
a
reluctant
thing
in
the
clutch
of
the
impetuous
river
she
hesitated
faltered
debated
with
herself
frequently
she
seemed
about
to
address
people
then
of
a
sudden
she
would
evidently
lose
her
courage
meanwhile
the
torrent
jostled
her
swung
her
this
and
that
way
at
last
however
she
saw
two
young
women
gazing
in
at
a
they
were
girls
they
wore
gowns
with
enormous
sleeves
that
made
them
look
like
ships
with
all
sails
set
they
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
time
they
leisurely
scanned
the
goods
in
the
window
other
people
had
made
the
tiny
old
woman
much
afraid
because
obviously
they
were
speeding
to
keep
such
tremendously
important
engagements
she
went
close
to
the
girls
and
peered
in
at
the
same
window
she
watched
them
furtively
for
a
time
then
finally
she
said
excuse
me
the
girls
looked
down
at
this
old
face
with
its
two
large
eyes
turned
towards
them
excuse
me
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
get
any
work
for
an
instant
the
two
girls
stared
then
they
seemed
about
to
exchange
a
smile
but
at
the
last
moment
they
checked
it
the
tiny
old
eyes
were
upon
them
she
was
quaintly
serious
silently
expectant
she
made
one
marvel
that
in
that
face
the
wrinkles
showed
no
trace
of
experience
knowledge
they
were
simply
little
soft
innocent
creases
as
for
her
glance
it
had
the
trustfulness
of
ignorance
and
the
candour
of
babyhood
i
want
to
get
something
to
do
because
i
need
the
money
she
continued
since
in
their
astonishment
they
had
not
replied
to
her
first
question
of
course
i
not
strong
and
i
could
do
very
much
but
i
can
sew
well
and
in
a
house
where
there
was
a
good
many
men
folks
i
could
do
all
the
mending
do
you
know
any
place
where
they
would
like
me
to
come
the
young
women
did
then
exchange
a
smile
but
it
was
a
subtle
tender
smile
the
edge
of
personal
grief
well
no
madame
hesitatingly
said
one
of
them
at
last
i
think
i
know
any
one
a
shade
passed
over
the
tiny
old
lady
face
a
shadow
of
the
wing
of
disappointment
do
you
she
said
with
a
little
struggle
to
be
brave
in
her
voice
then
the
girl
hastily
continued
but
if
you
will
give
me
your
address
i
may
find
some
one
and
if
i
do
i
will
surely
let
you
know
of
it
the
tiny
old
lady
dictated
her
address
bending
over
to
watch
the
girl
write
on
a
visiting
card
with
a
little
silver
pencil
then
she
said
i
thank
you
very
much
she
bowed
to
them
smiling
and
went
on
down
the
avenue
as
for
the
two
girls
they
walked
to
the
curb
and
watched
this
aged
figure
small
and
frail
in
its
black
gown
and
curious
black
bonnet
at
last
the
crowd
the
innumerable
wagons
intermingling
and
changing
with
uproar
and
riot

writing
he
may
be
the
author
who
will
introduce
the
united
states
to
the
ordinary
english
world
we
have
never
come
across
a
book
that
brought
certain
sections
of
american
society
so
perfectly
before
the
reader
as
does
third
the
picture
is
an
extremely
pleasant
one
and
its
truth
appeals
to
the
english
reader
so
that
the
effect
of
the
book
is
to
draw
him
nearer
to
his
american
cousins
third
incidentally
contains
the
best
dog
that
we
have
come
across
in
modern
fiction
crane
dialogue
is
excellent
and
it
is
dialogue
of
a
type
for
which
neither
red
badge
of
nor
his
other
books
had
prepared
us
by
this
latest
product
of
his
genius
our
impression
of
crane
is
confirmed
that
for
psychological
insight
for
dramatic
intensity
and
for
potency
of
phrase
he
is
already
in
the
front
rank
of
writers
of
fiction
and
that
he
possesses
a
certain
separate
quality
which
places
him
apart
it
is
a
short
story
and
a
slender
but
taking
it
in
conjunction
with
what
he
has
previously
given
us
there
remains
in
our
judgment
no
room
for
doubt
an
idyll
and
a
very
pretty
one
in
red
badge
of
and
there
is
an
intenser
force
but
in
this
slighter
effort
we
feel
the
same
directness
the
same
true
reading
of
the
workings
of
the
mind
the
same
contempt
for
conventions
and
sentiment
there
is
a
strong
human
interest
in
it
and
a
boyish
vigour
which
is
refreshing
it
is
very
light
very
amusing
and
very
american
the
literary
touch
is
singularly
deft
and
felicitous
the
strokes
playful
but
unerring
the
treatment
has
the
distinction
which
only
a
vivid
imagination
a
fine
dramatic
faculty
and
an
intuitive
perception
of
the
deeper
things
of
human
nature
can
give
to
a
book
it
is
invigorating
to
follow
the
breezy
mountain
life
up
in
the
pine
woods
the
book
abounds
in
those
felicitous
descriptions
and
bright
dialogues
of
which
crane
is
master
one
more
delightful
dog
is
added
to
the
heroes
of
fiction
we
would
not
for
the
world
have
it
other
than
it
is
in
its
short
tantalisingly
abrupt
chapters
the
tale
gives
the
history
of
a
wooing
a
history
clear
simple
and
often
sparkling
as
a
rill
of
