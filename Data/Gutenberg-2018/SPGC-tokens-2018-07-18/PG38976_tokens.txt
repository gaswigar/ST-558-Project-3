once
there
lived
a
king
whose
wife
was
dead
but
who
had
a
most
beautiful
daughter
so
beautiful
that
every
one
thought
she
must
be
good
as
well
instead
of
which
the
princess
was
really
very
wicked
and
practised
witchcraft
and
black
magic
which
she
had
learned
from
an
old
witch
who
lived
in
a
hut
on
the
side
of
a
lonely
mountain
this
old
witch
was
wicked
and
hideous
and
no
one
but
the
king
daughter
knew
that
she
lived
there
but
at
night
when
every
one
else
was
asleep
the
princess
whose
name
was
fiorimonde
used
to
visit
her
by
stealth
to
learn
sorcery
it
was
only
the
witch
arts
which
had
made
fiorimonde
so
beautiful
that
there
was
no
one
like
her
in
the
world
and
in
return
the
princess
helped
her
with
all
her
tricks
and
never
told
any
one
she
was
there
the
time
came
when
the
king
began
to
think
he
should
like
his
daughter
to
marry
so
he
summoned
his
council
and
said
we
have
no
son
to
reign
after
our
death
so
we
had
best
seek
for
a
suitable
prince
to
marry
to
our
royal
daughter
and
then
when
we
are
too
old
he
shall
be
king
in
our
stead
and
all
the
council
said
he
was
very
wise
and
it
would
be
well
for
the
princess
to
marry
so
heralds
were
sent
to
all
the
neighbouring
kings
and
princes
to
say
that
the
king
would
choose
a
husband
for
the
princess
who
should
be
king
after
him
but
when
fiorimonde
heard
this
she
wept
with
rage
for
she
knew
quite
well
that
if
she
had
a
husband
he
would
find
out
how
she
went
to
visit
the
old
witch
and
would
stop
her
practising
magic
and
then
she
would
lose
her
beauty
when
night
came
and
every
one
in
the
palace
was
fast
asleep
the
princess
went
to
her
bedroom
window
and
softly
opened
it
then
she
took
from
her
pocket
a
handful
of
peas
and
held
them
out
of
the
window
and
chirruped
low
and
there
flew
down
from
the
roof
a
small
brown
bird
and
sat
upon
her
wrist
and
began
to
eat
the
peas
no
sooner
had
it
swallowed
them
than
it
began
to
grow
and
grow
and
grow
till
it
was
so
big
that
the
princess
could
not
hold
it
but
let
it
stand
on
the
and
still
it
grew
and
grew
and
grew
till
it
was
as
large
as
an
ostrich
then
the
princess
climbed
out
of
the
window
and
seated
herself
on
the
bird
back
and
at
once
it
flew
straight
away
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
till
it
came
to
the
mountain
where
the
old
witch
dwelt
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
door
of
her
hut
the
princess
jumped
off
and
muttered
some
words
through
the
keyhole
when
a
croaking
voice
from
within
called
why
do
you
come
have
i
not
told
you
i
wished
to
be
left
alone
for
thirteen
nights
why
do
you
disturb
me
but
i
beg
of
you
to
let
me
in
said
the
princess
for
i
am
in
trouble
and
want
your
help
come
in
then
said
the
voice
and
the
door
flew
open
and
the
princess
trod
into
the
hut
in
the
middle
of
which
wrapped
in
a
gray
cloak
which
almost
hid
her
sat
the
witch
princess
fiorimonde
sat
down
near
her
and
told
her
her
story
how
the
king
wished
her
to
marry
and
had
sent
word
to
the
neighbouring
princes
that
they
might
make
offers
for
her
this
is
truly
bad
hearing
croaked
the
witch
but
we
shall
beat
them
yet
and
you
must
deal
with
each
prince
as
he
comes
would
you
like
them
to
become
dogs
to
come
at
your
call
or
birds
to
fly
in
the
air
and
sing
of
your
beauty
or
will
you
make
them
all
into
beads
the
beads
of
such
a
necklace
as
never
woman
wore
before
so
that
they
may
rest
upon
your
neck
and
you
may
take
them
with
you
always
the
necklace
the
necklace
cried
the
princess
clapping
her
hands
with
joy
that
will
be
best
of
all
to
sling
them
upon
a
string
and
wear
them
around
my
throat
little
will
the
courtiers
know
whence
come
my
new
jewels
but
this
is
a
dangerous
play
quoth
the
witch
for
unless
you
are
very
careful
you
yourself
may
become
a
bead
and
hang
upon
the
string
with
the
others
and
there
you
will
remain
till
some
one
cuts
the
string
and
draws
you
off
nay
never
fear
said
the
princess
i
will
be
careful
only
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
will
have
great
princes
and
kings
to
adorn
me
and
all
their
greatness
shall
not
help
them
then
the
witch
dipped
her
hand
into
a
black
bag
which
stood
on
the
ground
beside
her
and
drew
out
a
long
gold
thread
the
ends
were
joined
together
but
no
one
could
see
the
joins
and
however
much
you
pulled
it
would
not
break
it
would
easily
go
over
head
and
the
witch
slipped
it
on
her
neck
saying
now
mind
while
this
hangs
here
you
are
safe
enough
but
if
once
you
join
your
fingers
around
the
string
you
too
will
meet
the
fate
of
your
lovers
and
hang
upon
it
yourself
as
for
the
kings
and
princes
who
would
marry
you
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
make
them
close
their
fingers
around
the
chain
and
at
once
they
will
be
strung
upon
it
as
bright
hard
beads
and
there
they
shall
remain
till
it
is
cut
and
they
drop
off
this
is
really
delightful
cried
the
princess
and
i
am
already
quite
impatient
for
the
first
to
come
that
i
may
try
and
now
said
the
witch
since
you
are
here
and
there
is
yet
time
we
will
have
a
dance
and
i
will
summon
the
guests
so
saying
she
took
from
a
corner
a
drum
and
a
pair
of
and
going
to
the
door
began
to
beat
upon
it
it
made
a
terrible
rattling
in
a
moment
came
flying
through
the
air
all
sorts
of
forms
there
were
little
dark
elves
with
long
tails
and
goblins
who
chattered
and
laughed
and
other
witches
who
rode
on
there
was
one
wicked
fairy
in
the
form
of
a
large
cat
with
bright
green
eyes
and
another
came
sliding
in
like
a
long
shining
viper
then
when
all
had
arrived
the
witch
stopped
drumming
and
going
to
the
middle
of
the
hut
stamped
on
the
floor
and
a
opened
in
the
ground
the
old
witch
stepped
through
it
and
led
the
way
down
a
narrow
dark
passage
to
a
large
underground
chamber
and
all
her
strange
guests
followed
and
here
they
all
danced
and
made
merry
in
a
terrible
way
but
at
first
sound
of
all
the
guests
disappeared
with
a
whiff
and
the
princess
hastened
up
the
dark
passage
again
and
out
of
the
hut
to
where
her
big
bird
still
waited
for
her
and
mounting
its
back
she
flew
home
in
a
trice
then
when
she
had
stepped
in
at
her
bedroom
window
she
poured
into
a
cup
from
a
small
black
bottle
a
few
drops
of
magic
water
and
gave
it
to
the
bird
to
drink
and
as
it
sipped
it
grew
smaller
and
smaller
till
at
last
it
had
quite
regained
its
natural
size
and
hopped
on
to
the
roof
as
before
and
the
princess
shut
her
window
and
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
and
no
one
knew
of
her
strange
journey
or
where
she
had
been
next
day
fiorimonde
declared
to
her
father
the
king
that
she
was
quite
willing
to
wed
any
prince
he
should
fix
upon
as
a
husband
for
her
at
which
he
was
much
pleased
and
soon
after
informed
her
that
a
young
king
was
coming
from
over
the
sea
to
be
her
husband
he
was
king
of
a
large
rich
country
and
would
take
back
his
bride
with
him
to
his
home
he
was
called
king
pierrot
great
preparations
were
made
for
his
arrival
and
the
princess
was
decked
in
her
finest
array
to
greet
him
and
when
he
came
all
the
courtiers
said
this
is
truly
a
proper
husband
for
our
beautiful
princess
for
he
was
strong
and
handsome
with
black
hair
and
eyes
like
sloes
king
pierrot
was
delighted
with
fiorimonde
beauty
and
was
happy
as
the
day
is
long
and
all
things
went
merrily
till
the
evening
before
the
marriage
a
great
feast
was
held
at
which
the
princess
looked
lovelier
than
ever
dressed
in
a
red
gown
the
colour
of
the
inside
of
a
rose
but
she
wore
no
jewels
nor
ornaments
of
any
kind
save
one
shining
gold
string
round
her
throat
when
the
feast
was
done
the
princess
stepped
from
her
golden
chair
at
her
father
side
and
walked
softly
into
the
garden
and
stood
under
an
looking
at
the
shining
moon
in
a
few
moments
king
pierrot
followed
her
and
stood
beside
her
looking
at
her
and
wondering
at
her
beauty
then
my
sweet
princess
you
will
be
my
queen
and
share
all
i
possess
what
gift
would
you
wish
me
to
give
you
on
our
wedding
day
i
would
have
a
necklace
wrought
of
the
finest
gold
and
jewels
to
be
found
and
just
the
length
of
this
gold
cord
which
i
wear
around
my
throat
answered
princess
fiorimonde
why
do
you
wear
that
cord
asked
king
pierrot
it
has
no
jewel
nor
ornament
about
it
nay
but
there
is
no
cord
like
mine
in
all
the
world
cried
fiorimonde
and
her
eyes
sparkled
wickedly
as
she
spoke
it
is
as
light
as
a
feather
but
stronger
than
an
iron
chain
take
it
in
both
hands
and
try
to
break
it
that
you
may
see
how
strong
it
is
and
king
pierrot
took
the
cord
in
both
hands
to
pull
it
hard
but
no
sooner
were
his
fingers
closed
around
it
than
he
vanished
like
a
puff
of
smoke
and
on
the
cord
appeared
a
bright
beautiful
bead
so
bright
and
beautiful
as
was
never
bead
before
clear
as
crystal
but
shining
with
all
colours
green
blue
and
gold
princess
fiorimonde
gazed
down
at
it
and
laughed
aloud
aha
my
proud
lover
are
you
there
she
cried
with
glee
my
necklace
bids
fair
to
beat
all
others
in
the
world
and
she
caressed
the
bead
with
the
tips
of
her
soft
white
fingers
but
was
careful
that
they
did
not
close
round
the
string
then
she
returned
into
the
banqueting
hall
and
spoke
to
the
king
pray
sire
said
she
send
some
one
at
once
to
find
king
pierrot
for
as
he
was
talking
to
me
a
minute
ago
he
suddenly
left
me
and
i
am
afraid
lest
i
may
have
given
him
offence
or
perhaps
he
is
the
king
desired
that
the
servants
should
seek
for
king
pierrot
all
over
the
grounds
and
seek
him
they
did
but
nowhere
was
he
to
be
found
and
the
old
king
looked
offended
doubtless
he
will
be
ready
in
time
for
the
wedding
quoth
he
but
we
are
not
best
pleased
that
he
should
treat
us
in
this
way
princess
fiorimonde
had
a
little
maid
called
yolande
she
was
a
girl
with
merry
brown
eyes
but
she
was
not
beautiful
like
fiorimonde
and
she
did
not
love
her
mistress
for
she
was
afraid
of
her
and
suspected
her
of
her
wicked
ways
when
she
undressed
her
that
night
she
noticed
the
gold
cord
and
the
one
bright
bead
upon
it
and
as
she
combed
the
princess
hair
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
into
the
and
saw
how
she
laughed
and
how
fondly
she
looked
at
the
cord
and
caressed
the
bead
again
and
again
with
her
fingers
that
is
a
wonderful
bead
on
your
highness
cord
said
yolande
looking
at
its
reflection
in
the
mirror
surely
it
must
be
a
bridal
gift
from
king
pierrot
and
so
it
is
little
yolande
cried
fiorimonde
laughing
merrily
and
the
best
gift
he
could
give
me
but
i
think
one
bead
alone
looks
ugly
and
ungainly
soon
i
hope
i
shall
have
another
and
another
and
another
all
as
beautiful
as
the
first
then
yolande
shook
her
head
and
said
to
herself
this
bodes
no
good
next
morning
all
was
prepared
for
the
marriage
and
the
princess
was
dressed
in
white
satin
and
pearls
with
a
long
white
lace
veil
over
her
and
a
bridal
wreath
on
her
head
and
she
stood
waiting
among
her
grandly
dressed
ladies
who
all
said
that
such
a
beautiful
bride
had
never
been
seen
in
the
world
before
but
just
as
they
were
preparing
to
go
down
to
the
fine
company
in
the
hall
a
messenger
came
in
great
haste
summoning
the
princess
at
once
to
her
father
the
king
as
he
was
much
perplexed
my
daughter
cried
he
as
fiorimonde
in
all
her
bridal
array
entered
the
room
where
he
sat
alone
what
can
we
do
king
pierrot
is
nowhere
to
be
found
i
fear
lest
he
may
have
been
seized
by
robbers
and
basely
murdered
for
his
rich
clothes
or
carried
away
to
some
mountain
and
left
there
to
starve
my
soldiers
are
gone
far
and
wide
to
seek
him
and
we
shall
hear
of
him
ere
day
is
done
but
where
there
is
no
bridegroom
there
can
be
no
bridal
then
let
it
be
put
off
my
father
cried
the
princess
and
we
shall
know
if
it
is
for
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
we
must
dress
and
she
pretended
to
weep
but
even
then
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
so
the
wedding
guests
went
away
and
the
princess
laid
aside
her
bridal
dress
and
all
waited
anxiously
for
news
of
king
pierrot
and
no
news
came
so
at
last
every
one
gave
him
up
for
dead
and
mourned
for
him
and
wondered
how
he
had
met
his
fate
princess
fiorimonde
put
on
a
black
gown
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
live
in
seclusion
for
one
month
in
which
to
grieve
for
king
pierrot
but
when
she
was
again
alone
in
her
bedroom
she
sat
before
her
and
laughed
till
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
and
yolande
watched
her
and
trembled
when
she
heard
her
laughter
she
noticed
too
that
beneath
her
black
gown
the
princess
still
wore
her
gold
cord
and
did
not
move
it
night
or
day
the
month
had
barely
passed
away
when
the
king
came
to
his
daughter
and
announced
that
another
suitor
had
presented
himself
whom
he
should
much
like
to
be
her
husband
the
princess
agreed
quite
obediently
to
all
her
father
said
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
this
new
prince
was
called
prince
hildebrandt
he
came
from
a
country
far
north
of
which
one
day
he
would
be
king
he
was
tall
and
fair
and
strong
with
flaxen
hair
and
bright
blue
eyes
when
princess
fiorimonde
saw
his
portrait
she
was
much
pleased
and
said
by
all
means
let
him
come
and
the
sooner
the
better
so
she
put
off
her
black
clothes
and
again
great
preparations
were
made
for
a
wedding
and
king
pierrot
was
quite
forgotten
prince
hildebrandt
came
and
with
him
many
fine
gentlemen
and
they
brought
beautiful
gifts
for
the
bride
the
evening
of
his
arrival
all
went
well
and
again
there
was
a
grand
feast
and
fiorimonde
looked
so
beautiful
that
prince
hildebrandt
was
delighted
and
this
time
she
did
not
leave
her
father
side
but
sat
by
him
all
the
evening
early
next
morning
at
sunrise
when
every
one
was
still
sleeping
the
princess
rose
and
dressed
herself
in
a
plain
white
gown
and
brushed
all
her
hair
over
her
shoulders
and
crept
quietly
downstairs
into
the
palace
gardens
then
she
walked
on
till
she
came
beneath
the
window
of
prince
hildebrandt
room
and
here
she
paused
and
began
to
sing
a
little
song
as
sweet
and
joyous
as
a
lark
when
prince
hildebrandt
heard
it
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
to
see
who
sang
and
when
he
saw
fiorimonde
standing
in
the
red
which
made
her
hair
look
gold
and
her
face
rosy
he
made
haste
to
dress
himself
and
go
down
to
meet
her
how
my
princess
cried
he
as
he
stepped
into
the
garden
beside
her
this
is
indeed
great
happiness
to
meet
you
here
so
early
tell
me
why
do
you
come
out
at
sunrise
to
sing
by
yourself
i
come
that
i
may
see
the
colours
of
the
sky
red
blue
and
gold
answered
the
princess
look
there
are
no
such
colours
to
be
seen
anywhere
unless
indeed
it
be
in
this
bead
which
i
wear
here
on
my
golden
cord
what
is
that
bead
and
where
did
it
come
from
asked
hildebrandt
it
came
from
over
the
sea
where
it
shall
never
return
again
answered
the
princess
and
again
her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
eagerness
and
she
could
scarcely
conceal
her
mirth
lift
the
cord
off
my
neck
and
look
at
it
near
and
tell
me
if
you
ever
saw
one
like
it
hildebrandt
put
out
his
hands
and
took
hold
of
the
cord
but
no
sooner
were
his
fingers
closed
around
it
than
he
vanished
and
a
new
bright
bead
was
slung
next
to
the
first
one
on
fiorimonde
chain
and
this
one
was
even
more
beautiful
than
the
other
the
princess
gave
a
long
low
laugh
quite
terrible
to
hear
oh
my
sweet
necklace
cried
she
how
beautiful
you
are
growing
i
think
i
love
you
more
than
anything
in
the
world
besides
then
she
went
softly
back
to
bed
without
any
one
hearing
her
and
fell
sound
asleep
and
slept
till
yolande
came
to
tell
her
it
was
time
for
her
to
get
up
and
dress
for
the
wedding
the
princess
was
dressed
in
gorgeous
clothes
and
only
yolande
noticed
that
beneath
her
satin
gown
she
wore
the
golden
cord
but
now
there
were
two
beads
upon
it
instead
of
one
scarcely
was
she
ready
when
the
king
burst
into
her
room
in
a
towering
rage
my
daughter
cried
he
there
is
a
plot
against
us
lay
aside
your
bridal
attire
and
think
no
more
of
prince
hildebrandt
for
he
too
has
disappeared
and
is
nowhere
to
be
found
at
this
the
princess
wept
and
entreated
that
hildebrandt
should
be
sought
for
far
and
near
but
she
laughed
to
herself
and
said
search
where
you
will
yet
you
shall
not
find
him
and
so
again
a
great
search
was
made
and
when
no
trace
of
the
prince
was
found
all
the
palace
was
in
an
uproar
the
princess
again
put
off
her
bride
dress
and
clad
herself
in
black
and
sat
alone
and
pretended
to
weep
but
yolande
who
watched
her
shook
her
head
and
said
more
will
come
and
go
before
the
wicked
princess
has
done
her
worst
a
month
passed
in
which
fiorimonde
pretended
to
mourn
for
hildebrandt
then
she
went
to
the
king
and
said
sire
i
pray
that
you
will
not
let
people
say
that
when
any
bridegroom
comes
to
marry
me
as
soon
as
he
has
seen
me
he
flies
rather
than
be
my
husband
i
beg
that
suitors
may
be
summoned
from
far
and
near
that
i
may
not
be
left
alone
unwed
the
king
agreed
and
envoys
were
sent
all
the
world
over
to
bid
any
who
would
come
and
be
the
husband
of
princess
fiorimonde
and
come
they
did
kings
and
princes
from
south
and
north
east
and
west
king
adrian
prince
sigbert
prince
algar
and
many
more
but
though
all
went
well
till
the
wedding
morning
when
it
was
time
to
go
to
church
no
bridegroom
was
to
be
found
the
old
king
was
sadly
frightened
and
would
fain
have
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
a
husband
for
the
princess
but
now
she
implored
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
not
to
let
her
be
disgraced
in
this
way
and
so
suitor
after
suitor
continued
to
come
and
now
it
was
known
far
and
wide
that
whoever
came
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
princess
fiorimonde
vanished
and
was
seen
no
more
of
men
the
courtiers
were
afraid
and
whispered
under
their
breath
it
is
not
all
right
it
can
not
be
but
only
yolande
noticed
how
the
beads
came
upon
the
golden
thread
till
it
was
covered
yet
there
always
was
room
for
one
bead
more
so
the
years
passed
and
every
year
princess
fiorimonde
grew
lovelier
and
lovelier
so
that
no
one
who
saw
her
could
guess
how
wicked
she
was
in
a
far
off
country
lived
a
young
prince
whose
name
was
florestan
he
had
a
dear
friend
named
gervaise
whom
he
loved
better
than
any
one
in
the
world
gervaise
was
tall
and
broad
and
stout
of
limb
and
he
loved
prince
florestan
so
well
that
he
would
gladly
have
died
to
serve
him
it
chanced
that
prince
florestan
saw
a
portrait
of
princess
fiorimonde
and
at
once
swore
he
would
go
to
her
father
court
and
beg
that
he
might
have
her
for
his
wife
and
gervaise
in
vain
tried
to
dissuade
him
there
is
an
evil
fate
about
the
princess
fiorimonde
quoth
he
many
have
gone
to
marry
her
but
where
are
they
now
i
do
know
or
care
answered
florestan
but
this
is
sure
that
i
will
wed
her
and
return
here
and
bring
my
bride
with
me
so
he
set
out
for
fiorimonde
home
and
gervaise
went
with
him
with
a
heavy
heart
when
they
reached
the
court
the
old
king
received
them
and
welcomed
them
warmly
and
he
said
to
his
courtiers
here
is
a
fine
young
prince
to
whom
we
would
gladly
see
our
daughter
let
us
hope
that
this
time
all
will
be
well
but
now
fiorimonde
had
grown
so
bold
that
she
scarcely
tried
to
conceal
her
mirth
i
will
gladly
marry
him
if
he
comes
to
the
church
she
said
but
if
he
is
not
there
what
can
i
do
and
she
laughed
long
and
merrily
till
those
who
heard
her
shuddered
when
the
princess
ladies
came
to
tell
her
that
prince
florestan
was
arrived
she
was
in
the
garden
lying
on
the
marble
edge
of
a
fountain
feeding
the
gold
fish
who
swam
in
the
water
bid
him
come
to
me
she
said
for
i
will
not
go
any
more
in
state
to
meet
any
suitors
neither
will
i
put
on
grand
attire
for
them
let
him
come
and
find
me
as
i
am
since
all
find
it
so
easy
to
come
and
go
so
her
ladies
told
the
prince
that
fiorimonde
waited
for
him
near
the
fountain
she
did
not
rise
when
he
came
to
where
she
lay
but
his
heart
bounded
with
joy
for
he
had
never
in
his
life
beheld
such
a
beautiful
woman
she
wore
a
thin
soft
white
dress
which
clung
to
her
lithe
figure
her
beautiful
arms
and
hands
were
bare
and
she
dabbled
with
them
in
the
water
and
played
with
the
fish
her
great
blue
eyes
were
sparkling
with
mirth
and
were
so
beautiful
that
no
one
noticed
the
wicked
look
hid
in
them
and
on
her
neck
lay
the
marvellous
necklace
which
was
itself
a
wonder
to
behold
you
have
my
best
greetings
prince
florestan
she
said
and
you
too
would
be
my
suitor
have
you
thought
well
of
what
you
would
do
since
so
many
princes
who
have
seen
me
have
fled
for
ever
rather
than
marry
me
and
as
she
spoke
she
raised
her
white
hand
from
the
water
and
held
it
out
to
the
prince
who
stooped
and
kissed
it
and
scarcely
knew
how
to
answer
her
for
bewilderment
at
her
great
loveliness
gervaise
followed
his
master
at
a
short
distance
but
he
was
ill
at
ease
and
trembled
for
fear
of
what
should
come
come
bid
your
friend
leave
us
said
fiorimonde
looking
at
gervaise
and
sit
beside
me
and
tell
me
of
your
home
and
why
you
wish
to
marry
me
and
all
pleasant
things
florestan
begged
that
gervaise
would
leave
them
for
a
little
and
he
walked
slowly
away
in
a
very
mournful
mood
he
went
on
down
the
walks
not
heeding
where
he
was
going
till
he
met
yolande
who
stood
beneath
a
tree
laden
with
rosy
apples
picking
the
fruit
and
throwing
it
into
a
basket
at
her
feet
he
would
have
passed
her
in
silence
but
she
stopped
him
and
said
have
you
come
with
the
new
prince
do
you
love
your
master
ay
better
than
any
one
else
on
the
earth
answered
gervaise
why
do
you
ask
and
where
is
he
now
said
yolande
not
heeding
gervaise
question
he
sits
by
the
fountain
with
the
beautiful
princess
said
gervaise
then
i
hope
you
have
said
to
him
well
for
be
assured
you
shall
never
see
him
again
said
yolande
nodding
her
head
why
not
and
who
are
you
to
talk
like
this
asked
gervaise
my
name
is
yolande
answered
she
and
i
am
princess
fiorimonde
maid
do
you
not
know
that
prince
florestan
is
the
eleventh
lover
who
has
come
to
marry
her
and
one
by
one
they
have
disappeared
and
only
i
know
where
they
are
gone
and
where
are
they
gone
cried
gervaise
and
why
do
you
not
tell
the
world
and
prevent
good
men
being
lost
like
this
because
i
fear
my
mistress
said
yolande
speaking
low
and
drawing
near
to
him
she
is
a
sorceress
and
she
wears
the
brave
kings
and
princes
who
come
to
woo
her
strung
upon
a
cord
round
her
neck
each
one
forms
the
bead
of
a
necklace
which
she
wears
both
day
and
night
i
have
watched
that
necklace
growing
first
it
was
only
an
empty
gold
thread
then
came
king
pierrot
and
when
he
disappeared
the
first
bead
appeared
upon
it
then
came
hildebrandt
and
two
beads
were
on
the
string
instead
of
one
then
followed
adrian
sigbert
and
algar
and
cenred
and
pharamond
and
baldwyn
and
leofric
and
raoul
and
all
are
gone
and
ten
beads
hang
upon
the
string
and
there
will
be
eleven
and
the
eleventh
will
be
your
prince
florestan
if
this
be
so
cried
gervaise
i
will
never
rest
till
i
have
plunged
my
sword
into
fiorimonde
heart
but
yolande
shook
her
head
she
is
a
sorceress
she
said
and
it
might
be
hard
to
kill
her
besides
that
might
not
break
the
spell
and
bring
back
the
princes
to
life
i
wish
i
could
show
you
the
necklace
and
you
might
count
the
beads
and
see
if
i
do
not
speak
truth
but
it
is
always
about
her
neck
both
night
and
day
so
it
is
impossible
take
me
to
her
room
when
she
is
asleep
and
let
me
see
it
there
said
gervaise
very
well
we
will
try
said
yolande
but
you
must
be
very
still
and
make
no
noise
for
if
she
wakes
remember
it
will
be
worse
for
us
both
when
night
came
and
all
in
the
palace
were
fast
asleep
gervaise
and
yolande
met
in
the
great
hall
and
yolande
told
him
that
the
princess
slumbered
soundly
so
now
let
us
go
said
she
and
i
will
show
you
the
necklace
on
which
fiorimonde
wears
her
lovers
strung
like
beads
though
how
she
transforms
them
i
know
not
stay
one
instant
yolande
said
gervaise
holding
her
back
as
she
would
have
tripped
upstairs
perhaps
try
how
i
may
i
shall
be
beaten
and
either
die
or
become
a
bead
like
those
who
have
come
before
me
but
if
i
succeed
and
rid
the
land
of
your
wicked
princess
what
will
you
promise
me
for
a
reward
what
would
you
have
asked
yolande
i
would
have
you
say
you
will
be
my
wife
and
come
back
with
me
to
my
own
land
said
gervaise
that
i
will
promise
gladly
said
yolande
kissing
him
but
we
must
not
speak
or
think
of
this
till
we
have
cut
the
cord
from
fiorimonde
neck
and
all
her
lovers
are
set
free
so
they
went
softly
up
to
the
princess
room
yolande
holding
a
small
lantern
which
gave
only
a
dim
light
there
in
her
grand
bed
lay
princess
fiorimonde
they
could
just
see
her
by
the
lantern
light
and
she
looked
so
beautiful
that
gervaise
began
to
think
yolande
spoke
falsely
when
she
said
she
was
so
wicked
her
face
was
calm
and
sweet
as
a
baby
her
hair
fell
in
ruddy
waves
on
the
pillow
her
rosy
lips
smiled
and
little
dimples
showed
in
her
cheeks
her
white
soft
hands
were
folded
amidst
the
scented
lace
and
linen
of
which
the
bed
was
made
gervaise
almost
forgot
to
look
at
the
glittering
beads
hung
round
her
throat
in
wondering
at
her
loveliness
but
yolande
pulled
him
by
the
arm
do
not
look
at
her
she
whispered
softly
since
her
beauty
has
cost
dear
already
look
rather
at
what
remains
of
those
who
thought
her
as
fair
as
you
do
now
see
here
and
she
pointed
with
her
finger
to
each
bead
in
turn
this
was
pierrot
and
this
hildebrandt
and
these
are
adrian
and
sigbert
and
algar
and
cenred
and
that
is
pharamond
and
that
raoul
and
last
of
all
here
is
your
own
master
prince
florestan
seek
him
now
where
you
will
and
you
will
not
find
him
and
you
shall
never
see
him
again
till
the
cord
is
cut
and
the
charm
broken
of
what
is
the
cord
made
whispered
gervaise
it
is
of
the
finest
gold
she
answered
nay
do
not
you
touch
her
lest
she
wake
i
will
show
it
to
you
and
yolande
put
down
the
lantern
and
softly
put
out
her
hands
to
slip
the
beads
aside
but
as
she
did
so
her
fingers
closed
around
the
golden
string
and
directly
she
was
gone
another
bead
was
added
to
the
necklace
and
gervaise
was
alone
with
the
sleeping
princess
he
gazed
about
him
in
sore
amazement
and
fear
he
dared
not
call
lest
fiorimonde
should
wake
yolande
he
whispered
as
loud
as
he
dared
yolande
where
are
you
but
no
yolande
answered
then
he
bent
down
over
the
princess
and
gazed
at
the
necklace
another
bead
was
strung
upon
it
next
to
the
one
to
which
yolande
had
pointed
as
prince
florestan
again
he
counted
them
eleven
before
now
there
are
twelve
oh
hateful
princess
i
know
now
where
go
the
brave
kings
and
princes
who
came
to
woo
you
and
where
too
is
my
yolande
and
as
he
looked
at
the

filled
his
eyes

was

and
clearer
than
the
others

of
a
warm
red
hue
like
the
red
dress
yolande
had
worn
the
princess
turned
and
laughed
in
her
sleep
and
at
the
sound
of
her
laughter
gervaise
was
filled
with
horror
and
loathing
he
crept
shuddering
from
the
room
and
all
night
long
sat
up
alone
plotting
how
he
might
defeat
fiorimonde
and
set
florestan
and
yolande

next
morning
when
fiorimonde
dressed
she
looked
at
her
necklace
and
counted
its
beads

she
was
much

she
looked
at
her
necklace

counted
its

she

who
can

and
grasped
my
chain
unknown
to
me
she
said
to
herself
and
she
sat
and
pondered
for
a
long
time
at
last
she
broke
into
weird
laughter
at
any
rate
whoever
it
was
is
fitly
punished
quoth
she
my
brave
necklace
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
and
if
any
one
tries
to
steal
you
they
will
get
their
reward
and
add
to
my
glory
in
truth
i
may
sleep
in
peace
and
fear
nothing
the
day
passed
away
and
no
one
missed
yolande
towards
sunset
the
rain
began
to
pour
in
torrents
and
there
was
such
a
terrible
thunderstorm
that
every
one
was
frightened
the
thunder
roared
the
lightning
gleamed
flash
after
flash
every
moment
it
grew
fiercer
and
fiercer
the
sky
was
so
dark
that
save
for
the
lightning
light
nothing
could
be
seen
but
princess
fiorimonde
loved
the
thunder
and
lightning
she
sat
in
a
room
high
up
in
one
of
the
towers
clad
in
a
black
velvet
dress
and
she
watched
the
lightning
from
the
window
and
laughed
at
each
peal
of
thunder
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
a
stranger
wrapped
in
a
cloak
rode
to
the
palace
door
and
the
ladies
ran
to
tell
the
princess
that
a
new
prince
had
come
to
be
her
suitor
and
he
will
not
tell
his
name
said
they
but
says
he
hears
that
all
are
bidden
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
princess
fiorimonde
and
he
too
would
try
his
good
fortune
let
him
come
at
once
cried
the
princess
be
he
prince
or
knave
what
care
i
if
princes
all
fly
from
me
it
may
be
better
to
marry
a
peasant
so
they
led
the
up
to
the
room
where
fiorimonde
sat
he
was
wrapped
in
a
thick
cloak
but
he
flung
it
aside
as
he
came
in
and
showed
how
rich
was
his
silken
clothing
underneath
and
so
well
was
he
disguised
that
fiorimonde
never
saw
that
it
was
gervaise
but
looked
at
him
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
him
before
you
are
most
welcome
stranger
prince
who
has
come
through
such
lightning
and
thunder
to
find
me
said
she
is
it
true
then
that
you
wish
to
be
my
suitor
what
have
you
heard
of
me
it
is
quite
true
princess
said
gervaise
and
i
have
heard
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
and
is
that
true
also
asked
the
princess
look
at
me
now
and
see
gervaise
looked
at
her
and
in
his
heart
he
said
it
is
quite
true
oh
wicked
princess
there
never
was
woman
as
beautiful
as
you
and
never
before
did
i
hate
a
woman
as
i
hate
you
now
but
aloud
he
said
no
princess
that
is
not
true
you
are
very
beautiful
but
i
have
seen
a
woman
who
is
fairer
than
you
for
all
that
your
skin
looks
ivory
against
your
velvet
dress
and
your
hair
is
like
gold
a
woman
who
is
fairer
than
i
cried
fiorimonde
and
her
breast
began
to
heave
and
her
eyes
to
sparkle
with
rage
for
never
before
had
she
heard
such
a
thing
said
who
are
you
who
dares
come
and
tell
me
of
women
more
beautiful
than
i
am
i
am
a
suitor
who
asks
to
be
your
husband
princess
answered
gervaise
but
still
i
say
i
have
seen
a
woman
who
was
fairer
than
you
who
is
she
where
is
she
cried
fiorimonde
who
could
scarcely
contain
her
anger
bring
her
here
at
once
that
i
may
see
if
you
speak
the
truth
what
will
you
give
me
to
bring
her
to
you
said
gervaise
give
me
that
necklace
you
wear
on
your
neck
and
then
i
will
summon
her
in
an
instant
but
fiorimonde
shook
her
head
you
have
asked
said
she
for
the
only
thing
from
which
i
can
not
part
and
then
she
bade
her
maids
bring
her
her
and
she
drew
out
diamonds
and
rubies
and
pearls
and
offered
them
all
or
any
to
gervaise
the
lightning
shone
on
them
and
made
them
shine
and
flash
but
he
shook
his
head
no
none
of
these
will
do
quoth
he
you
can
see
her
for
the
necklace
but
for
nothing
else
take
it
off
for
yourself
then
cried
fiorimonde
who
now
was
so
angry
that
she
only
wished
to
be
rid
of
gervaise
in
any
way
no
indeed
said
gervaise
i
am
no
and
should
not
know
how
to
clasp
and
unclasp
it
and
in
spite
of
all
fiorimonde
could
say
or
do
he
would
not
touch
either
her
or
the
magic
chain
at
night
the
storm
grew
even
fiercer
but
it
did
not
trouble
the
princess
she
waited
till
all
were
asleep
and
then
she
opened
her
bedroom
window
and
chirruped
softly
to
the
little
brown
bird
who
flew
down
from
the
roof
at
her
call
then
she
gave
him
a
handful
of
seeds
as
before
and
he
grew
and
grew
and
grew
till
he
was
as
large
as
an
ostrich
and
she
sat
upon
his
back
and
flew
out
through
the
air
laughing
at
the
lightning
and
thunder
which
flashed
and
roared
around
her
away
they
flew
till
they
came
to
the
old
witch
cave
and
here
they
found
the
witch
sitting
at
her
open
door
catching
the
lightning
to
make
charms
with
welcome
my
dear
croaked
she
as
fiorimonde
stepped
from
the
bird
here
is
a
night
we
both
love
well
and
how
goes
the
necklace
right
merrily
i
see
twelve
beads
already
but
what
is
that
twelfth
and
she
looked
at
it
closely
nay
that
is
one
thing
i
want
you
to
tell
me
said
fiorimonde
drying
the
rain
from
her
golden
hair
last
night
when
i
slept
there
were
eleven
and
this
morning
there
are
twelve
and
i
know
not
from
whence
comes
the
twelfth
it
is
no
suitor
said
the
witch
but
from
some
young
maid
that
that
bead
is
made
but
why
should
you
mind
it
looks
well
with
the
others
some
young
maid
said
the
princess
then
it
must
be
cicely
or
marybel
or
yolande
who
would
have
robbed
me
of
my
necklace
as
i
slept
but
what
care
i
the
silly
wench
is
punished
now
and
so
may
all
others
be
who
would
do
the
same
and
when
will
you
get
the
thirteenth
bead
and
where
will
he
come
from
asked
the
witch
he
waits
at
the
palace
now
said
fiorimonde
chuckling
and
this
is
why
i
have
to
speak
to
you
and
then
she
told
the
witch
of
the
stranger
who
had
come
in
the
storm
and
of
how
he
would
not
touch
her
necklace
nor
take
the
cord
in
his
hand
and
how
he
said
also
that
he
knew
a
woman
fairer
than
she
beware
princess
beware
cried
the
witch
in
a
warning
voice
as
she
listened
why
should
you
heed
tales
of
other
women
fairer
than
you
have
i
not
made
you
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
and
can
any
others
do
more
than
i
give
no
ear
to
what
this
stranger
says
or
you
shall
rue
it
but
still
the
princess
murmured
and
said
she
did
not
love
to
hear
any
one
speak
of
others
as
beautiful
as
she
be
warned
in
time
cried
the
witch
or
you
will
have
cause
to
repent
it
are
you
so
silly
or
so
vain
as
to
be
troubled
because
a
prince
says
idly
what
you
know
is
not
true
i
tell
you
do
not
listen
to
him
but
let
him
be
slung
to
your
chain
as
soon
as
may
be
and
then
he
will
speak
no
more
and
then
they
talked
together
of
how
fiorimonde
could
make
gervaise
grasp
the
fatal
string
next
morning
when
the
sun
rose
gervaise
started
off
into
the
woods
and
there
he
plucked
acorns
and
haws
and
hips
and
strung
them
on
to
a
string
to
form
a
rude
necklace
this
he
hid
in
his
bosom
and
then
went
back
to
the
palace
without
telling
any
one
when
the
princess
rose
she
dressed
herself
as
beautifully
as
she
could
and
braided
her
golden
locks
with
great
care
for
this
morning
she
meant
her
new
suitor
to
meet
his
fate
after
breakfast
she
stepped
into
the
garden
where
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
all
looked
fresh
after
the
storm
here
from
the
grass
she
picked
up
a
golden
ball
and
began
to
play
with
it
go
to
our
new
guest
cried
she
to
her
ladies
and
ask
him
to
come
here
and
play
at
ball
with
me
so
they
went
and
soon
they
returned
bringing
gervaise
with
them
good
morrow
prince
cried
she
pray
come
and
try
your
skill
at
this
game
with
me
and
you
she
said
to
her
ladies
do
not
wait
to
watch
our
play
but
each
go
your
way
and
do
what
pleases
you
best
so
they
all
went
away
and
left
her
alone
with
gervaise
well
prince
cried
she
as
they
began
to
play
what
do
you
think
of
me
by
morning
light
yesterday
when
you
came
it
was
so
dark
with
thunder
and
clouds
that
you
could
scarcely
see
my
face
but
now
that
there
is
bright
sunshine
pray
look
well
at
me
and
see
if
you
do
not
think
me
as
beautiful
as
any
woman
on
earth
and
she
smiled
at
gervaise
and
looked
so
lovely
as
she
spoke
that
he
scarce
knew
how
to
answer
her
but
he
remembered
yolande
and
said
doubtless
you
are
very
beautiful
then
why
should
you
mind
my
telling
you
that
i
have
seen
a
woman
lovelier
than
you
at
this
the
princess
again
began
to
be
angry
but
she
thought
of
the
witch
words
and
said
then
if
you
think
there
is
a
woman
fairer
than
i
look
at
my
beads
and
now
that
you
see
their
colours
in
the
sun
say
if
you
ever
saw
such
jewels
before
it
is
true
i
have
never
seen
beads
like
yours
but
i
have
a
necklace
here
which
pleases
me
better
and
from
his
pocket
he
drew
the
haws
and
acorns
which
he
had
strung
together
what
is
that
necklace
and
where
did
you
get
it
show
it
to
me
cried
fiorimonde
but
gervaise
held
it
out
of
her
reach
and
said
i
like
my
necklace
better
than
yours
princess
and
believe
me
there
is
no
necklace
like
mine
in
all
the
world
why
is
it
a
fairy
necklace
what
does
it
do
pray
give
it
to
me
cried
fiorimonde
trembling
with
anger
and
curiosity
for
she
thought
perhaps
it
has
power
to
make
the
wearer
beautiful
perhaps
it
was
worn
by
the
woman
whom
he
thought
more
beautiful
than
i
and
that
is
why
she
looked
so
fair
come
i
will
make
a
fair
exchange
said
gervaise
give
me
your
necklace
and
you
shall
have
mine
and
when
it
is
round
your
throat
i
will
truthfully
say
that
you
are
the
fairest
woman
in
the
world
but
first
i
must
have
your
necklace
illustration
then
he
picked
up
the
necklace
on
the
point
of
his
sword
and
carried
it
slung
thereon
into
the
council
p
take
it
then
cried
the
princess
who
in
her
rage
and
eagerness
forgot
all
else
and
she
seized
the
string
of
beads
to
lift
it
from
her
neck
but
no
sooner
had
she
taken
it
in
her
hands
than
they
fell
with
a
rattle
to
the
earth
and
fiorimonde
herself
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
gervaise
bent
down
over
the
necklace
as
it
lay
upon
the
grass
and
with
a
smile
counted
thirteen
beads
and
he
knew
that
the
thirteenth
was
the
wicked
princess
who
had
herself
met
the
evil
fate
she
had
prepared
for
so
many
others
oh
clever
princess
cried
he
laughing
aloud
you
are
not
so
very
clever
i
think
to
be
so
easily
outwitted
then
he
picked
up
the
necklace
on
the
point
of
the
sword
and
carried
it
slung
thereon
into
the
council
chamber
where
sat
the
king
surrounded
by
statesmen
and
courtiers
busy
with
state
affairs
pray
king
said
gervaise
send
some
one
to
seek
for
princess
fiorimonde
a
moment
ago
she
played
with
me
at
ball
in
the
garden
and
now
she
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
king
desired
that
servants
should
seek
her
royal
highness
but
they
came
back
saying
she
was
not
to
be
found
then
let
me
see
if
i
can
not
bring
her
to
you
but
first
let
those
who
have
been
longer
lost
than
she
come
and
tell
their
own
tale
and
so
saying
gervaise
let
the
necklace
slip
from
his
sword
on
to
the
floor
and
taking
from
his
breast
a
sharp
dagger
proceeded
to
cut
the
golden
thread
on
which
the
beads
were
strung
and
as
he
clave
it
in
two
there
came
a
mighty
noise
like
a
clap
of
thunder
now
cried
he
look
and
see
king
pierrot
who
was
lost
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
from
the
cord
a
bead
and
king
pierrot
in
his
royal
clothes
with
his
sword
at
his
side
stood
before
them
treachery
he
cried
but
ere
he
could
say
more
gervaise
had
drawn
off
another
bead
and
king
hildebrandt
appeared
and
after
him
came
adrian
and
sigbert
and
algar
and
cenred
and
pharamond
and
raoul
and
last
of
the
princes
gervaise
own
dear
master
florestan
and
they
all
denounced
princess
fiorimonde
and
her
wickedness
and
now
cried
gervaise
here
is
she
who
has
helped
to
save
you
all
and
he
drew
off
the
twelfth
bead
and
there
stood
yolande
in
her
red
dress
and
when
he
saw
her
gervaise
flung
away
his
dagger
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
they
wept
for
joy
the
king
and
all
the
courtiers
sat
pale
and
trembling
unable
to
speak
for
fear
and
shame
at
length
the
king
said
with
a
deep
groan
we
owe
you
deep
amends
o
noble
kings
and
princes
what
punishment
do
you
wish
us
to
prepare
for
our
most
guilty
daughter
but
here
gervaise
stopped
him
and
said
give
her
no
other
punishment
than
what
she
has
chosen
for
herself
see
here
she
is
the
thirteenth
bead
upon
the
string
let
no
one
dare
to
draw
it
off
but
let
this
string
be
hung
up
where
all
people
can
see
it
and
see
the
one
bead
and
know
the
wicked
princess
is
punished
for
her
sorcery
so
it
will
be
a
warning
to
others
who
would
do
like
her
so
they
lifted
the
golden
thread
with
great
care
and
hung
it
up
outside
the
and
there
the
one
bead
glittered
and
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
and
all
who
saw
it
knew
that
it
was
the
wicked
princess
fiorimonde
who
had
justly
met
her
fate
then
all
the
kings
and
princes
thanked
gervaise
and
yolande
and
loaded
them
with
presents
and
each
went
to
his
own
land
and
gervaise
married
yolande
and
they
went
back
with
prince
florestan
to
their
home
and
all
lived
happily
to
the
end
of
their
lives
illustration
the
wanderings
of
arasmon
illustration
long
ago
there
lived
a
wandering
musician
and
his
wife
whose
names
were
arasmon
and
chrysea
arasmon
played
upon
a
lute
to
which
chrysea
sang
and
their
music
was
so
beautiful
that
people
followed
them
in
crowds
and
gave
them
as
much
money
as
they
wanted
when
arasmon
played
all
who
heard
him
were
silent
from
wonder
and
admiration
but
when
chrysea
sang
they
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
for
her
voice
was
more
beautiful
than
anything
they
had
ever
heard
before
both
were
young
and
lovely
and
were
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
for
they
loved
each
other
dearly
and
liked
wandering
about
seeing
new
countries
and
people
and
making
sweet
music
they
went
to
all
sorts
of
places
sometimes
to
big
cities
sometimes
to
little
villages
sometimes
to
lonely
cottages
by
the
and
sometimes
they
strolled
along
the
green
lanes
and
fields
singing
and
playing
so
exquisitely
that
the
very
birds
flew
down
from
the
trees
to
listen
to
them
one
day
they
crossed
a
dark
line
of
hills
and
came
out
on
a
wild
moorland
country
where
they
had
never
been
before
on
the
side
of
the
hill
they
saw
a
little
village
and
at
once
turned
towards
it
but
as
they
drew
near
chrysea
said
what
gloomy
place
is
this
see
how
dark
and
miserable
it
looks
illustration
one
by
one
the
villagers
came
out
of
their
cottages
and
gathered
round
them
to
p
let
us
try
to
cheer
it
with
some
music
said
arasmon
and
began
to
play
upon
his
lute
while
chrysea
sang
one
by
one
the
villagers
came
out
of
their
cottages
and
gathered
round
them
to
listen
but
chrysea
thought
she
had
never
before
seen
such
people
they
were
thin
and
bent
their
faces
were
pale
and
haggard
also
their
clothes
looked
old
and
threadbare
and
in
some
places
were
worn
into
holes
but
they
crowded
about
arasmon
and
chrysea
and
begged
them
to
go
on
playing
and
singing
and
as
they
listened
the
women
shed
tears
and
the
men
hid
their
faces
and
were
silent
when
they
stopped
the
people
began
to
feel
in
their
pockets
as
if
to
find
some
coins
but
arasmon
cried
nay
good
friends
keep
your
money
for
yourselves
you
have
not
too
much
of
it
to
judge
by
your
looks
but
let
us
stay
with
you
for
and
give
us
food
and
lodging
and
we
shall
think
ourselves
well
paid
and
will
play
and
sing
to
you
as
much
as
you
like
stay
with
us
as
long
as
you
can
stay
with
us
always
begged
the
people
and
each
one
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
receive
the
strangers
and
give
them
the
best
they
had
so
arasmon
and
chrysea
played
and
sang
to
them
till
they
were
tired
and
at
last
when
the
heavy
rain
began
to
fall
they
turned
towards
the
village
but
as
they
passed
through
its
narrow
streets
they
thought
the
place
itself
looked
even
sadder
than
its
inmates
the
houses
were
and
seemed
to
be
almost
tumbling
down
the
streets
were
uneven
and
badly
kept
in
the
gardens
they
saw
no
flowers
but
dank
dark
weeds
they
went
into
a
cottage
which
the
people
pointed
out
to
them
and
arasmon
lay
down
by
the
fire
calling
to
chrysea
to
rest
also
as
they
had
walked
far
and
she
must
be
weary
he
soon
fell
asleep
but
chrysea
sat
at
the
door
watching
the
dark
clouds
as
they
drifted
over
the
darker
houses
outside
the
cottage
hung
a
blackbird
in
a
cage
with
drooping
wings
and
scanty
plumage
it
was
the
only
animal
they
had
yet
seen
in
the
village
for
of
cats
or
dogs
or
there
seemed
to
be
none
when
she
saw
it
chrysea
turned
to
the
woman
of
the
house
who
stood
beside
her
and
said
why
do
you
let
it
go
it
would
be
much
happier
flying
about
in
the
sunshine
the
sun
never
shines
here
said
the
woman
sadly
it
could
not
pierce
through
the
dark
clouds
which
hang
over
the
village
besides
we
do
not
think
of
happiness
it
is
as
much
as
we
can
do
to
live
but
tell
me
said
chrysea
what
is
it
that
makes
you
so
sad
and
your
village
such
a
dreary
place
i
have
been
to
many
towns
in
my
life
but
to
none
which
looked
like
this
do
you
know
said
the
woman
that
this
place
is
cried
chrysea
what
do
you
mean
the
woman
turned
and
pointed
towards
the
moor
over
yonder
she
said
dwells
a
terrible
old
wizard
by
whom
we
are
bewitched
and
he
has
a
number
of
little
dark
elves
who
are
his
servants
and
these
are
they
who
make
our
village
what
you
see
it
you
do
know
how
sad
it
is
to
live
here
the
elves
steal
our
eggs
and
milk
and
poultry
so
that
there
is
never
enough
for
us
to
eat
and
we
are
they
pull
down
our
houses
and
undo
our
work
as
fast
as
we
do
it
they
steal
our
corn
when
it
is
standing
in
sheaves
so
that
we
find
nothing
but
empty
husks
and
as
she
ceased
speaking
the
woman
sighed
heavily
but
if
they
do
all
this
harm
said
chrysea
why
do
not
some
of
you
go
to
the
moor
and
drive
them
away
it
is
part
of
the
spell
said
the
woman
that
we
can
neither
hear
nor
see
them
i
have
heard
my
grandfather
say
that
in
the
old
time
this
place
was
no
different
to
others
but
one
day
this
terrible
old
magician
came
and
offered
the
villagers
a
great
deal
of
money
if
they
would
let
him
dwell
upon
the
moor
for
before
that
it
was
covered
with
golden
gorse
and
heather
and
the
country
folk
held
all
their
merrymakings
there
but
they
were
tempted
with
the
gold
and
sold
it
and
from
that
day
the
elves
have
tormented
us
and
as
we
can
not
see
them
we
can
not
get
rid
of
them
but
must
just
bear
them
as
best
we
may
that
is
a
sad
way
to
speak
said
chrysea
can
not
you
find
out
what
the
spell
really
is
and
break
it
it
is
a
song
said
the
woman
and
every
night
they
sing
it
afresh
it
is
said
that
if
any
one
could
go
to
the
moor
between
midnight
and
dawn
and
could
hear
them
singing
it
and
then
sing
through
the
tune
just
as
they
themselves
do
the
charm
would
be
broken
and
we
should
be
free
but
it
must
be
some
one
who
has
never
taken
their
money
so
we
can
not
do
it
for
we
can
neither
see
nor
hear
them
but
i
have
not
taken
their
money
said
chrysea
and
there
is
no
tune
i
can
not
sing
when
i
have
heard
it
once
so
i
will
go
to
the
moor
for
you
and
break
the
spell
nay
do
not
think
of
such
a
thing
cried
the
woman
for
the
elves
are
most
spiteful
and
you
do
know
what
harm
they
might
do
to
you
even
if
you
set
us
free
chrysea
said
no
more
but
all
the
evening
she
thought
of
what
the
woman
had
told
her
and
still
stood
looking
out
into
the
dismal
street
when
she
went
to
bed
she
did
not
sleep
but
lay
still
till
the
clock
struck
one
then
she
rose
softly
and
wrapping
herself
in
a
cloak
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
rain
as
she
passed
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
blackbird
crouching
in
the
bottom
of
its
cage
she
opened
the
cage
door
to
let
it
fly
but
still
it
did
not
move
so
she
lifted
it
out
in
her
hand
poor
bird
said
she
gently
i
wish
i
could
give
this
village
its
liberty
as
easily
as
i
can
give
you
yours
and
carrying
it
with
her
she
walked
on
towards
the
moor
it
was
a
large
waste
piece
of
land
and
looked
as
though
it
had
been
burnt
for
the
ground
was
charred
and
black
and
there
was
no
grass
or
green
plant
growing
on
it
but
there
were
some
blackened
stumps
of
trees
and
to
these
chrysea
went
and
hid
herself
behind
one
to
wait
and
see
what
would
come
she
watched
for
a
long
time
without
seeing
any
one
but
at
last
there
rose
from
the
ground
not
far
from
her
a
lurid
gleam
which
spread
and
spread
until
it
became
a
large
circle
of
light
in
the
midst
of
which
she
saw
small
dark
figures
moving
like
ugly
little
men
the
light
was
now
so
bright
that
she
could
distinguish
each
one
quite
plainly
and
never
before
had
she
seen
anything
so
ugly
for
they
were
black
as
ink
and
their
faces
were
twisted
and
looked
cruel
and
wicked
they
joined
hands
and
forming
a
ring
danced
slowly
round
and
as
they
did
so
the
ground
opened
and
there
rose
up
in
their
centre
a
tiny
village
exactly
like
the
village
only
that
the
houses
were
but
a
few
inches
high
round
this
the
elves
danced
and
then
they
began
to
sing
chrysea
listened
eagerly
to
their
singing
and
no
sooner
had
they
done
than
she
opened
her
lips
and
sang
the
same
tune
through
from
beginning
to
end
just
as
she
had
heard
it
her
voice
rang
out
loud
and
clear
and
at
the
sound
the
little
village
crumbled
and
fell
away
as
though
it
had
been
made
of
dust
the
elves
stood
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
wild
cry
they
all
rushed
towards
chrysea
and
at
their
head
she
saw
one
about
three
times
the
size
of
the
others
who
appeared
to
be
their
chief
come
quickly
let
us
punish
the
woman
who
has
dared
to
thwart
us
he
cried
what
shall
we
change
her
to
a
frog
to
croak
on
the
ground
cried
one
no
an
owl
to
hoot
in
the
night
cried
another
oh
for
pity
sake
implored
chrysea
do
change
me
to
one
of
these
loathsome
creatures
so
that
if
arasmon
finds
me
he
will
spurn
me
hear
her
cried
the
chief
and
let
her
have
her
will
let
us
change
her
to
no
bird
or
beast
but
to
a
bright
golden
harp
and
thus
shall
she
remain
until
upon
her
strings
some
one
shall
play
our
tune
which
she
has
dared
to
sing
agreed
cried
the
others
and
all
began
to
dance
round
chrysea
and
to
sing
as
they
had
sung
around
the
village
she
shrieked
and
tried
to
run
but
they
stopped
her
on
every
side
she
cried
arasmon
arasmon
but
no
one
came
and
when
the
elves
song
was
done
and
they
disappeared
all
that
was
left
was
a
little
gold
harp
hanging
upon
the
boughs
of
the
tree
and
only
the
blackbird
who
sat
above
knew
what
had
come
of
poor
chrysea
when
morning
dawned
and
the
villagers
awoke
all
felt
that
some
great
change
had
taken
place
the
heavy
cloud
which
hung
above
the
village
had
cleared
away
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
the
sky
was
blue
streams
which
had
been
dry
for
years
were
running
clear
and
fresh
and
the
people
all
felt
strong
and
able
to
work
again
the
trees
were
beginning
to
bud
and
in
their
branches
sang
birds
whose
voices
had
not
been
heard
there
for
many
a
long
year
the
villagers
looked
from
one
to
another
and
said
surely
the
spell
is
broken
surely
the
elves
must
have
fled
and
they
wept
for
joy
arasmon
woke
with
the
first
beam
of
the
sun
and
finding
chrysea
was
not
there
he
rose
and
went
to
seek
her
in
the
village
calling
chrysea
chrysea
the
sun
is
up
and
we
must
journey
on
our
way
but
no
chrysea
answered
so
he
walked
down
all
the
streets
calling
chrysea
come
chrysea
but
no
chrysea
came
then
he
said
she
has
gone
into
the
fields
to
look
for
wild
flowers
and
will
soon
be
back
so
he
waited
for
her
patiently
but
the
sun
rose
high
the
villagers
went
to
their
work
and
she
did
not
return
at
this
arasmon
was
frightened
and
asked
every
one
he
met
if
they
had
seen
her
but
each
one
shook
his
head
and
said
no
they
had
seen
nothing
of
her
then
he
called
some
of
the
men
together
and
told
them
that
his
wife
had
wandered
away
and
he
feared
lest
she
might
lose
herself
and
go
still
farther
and
he
asked
them
to
help
him
to
look
for
her
so
some
went
one
way
and
some
another
to
search
and
arasmon
himself
walked
for
miles
the
whole
country
round
calling
chrysea
chrysea
but
no
answer
came
the
sun
was
beginning
to
set
and
twilight
to
cover
the
land
when
arasmon
came
on
to
the
moor
where
chrysea
had
met
her
fate
that
too
was
changed
flowers
and
grass
were
already
beginning
to
grow
there
and
the
children
of
the
village
who
till
now
had
never
dared
to
venture
near
it
were
playing
about
it
arasmon
could
hear
their
voices
as
he
came
near
the
tree
against
which
chrysea
had
leaned
and
on
which
now
hung
the
golden
harp
in
the
branches
above
sat
the
blackbird
singing
and
arasmon
stopped
and
listened
to
its
song
and
thought
he
had
never
heard
a
bird
sing
so
sweetly
before
for
it
sang
the
magic
song
by
which
chrysea
had
broken
the
elves
spell
the
first
tune
it
had
heard
since
it
regained
its
liberty
dear
blackbird
said
arasmon
looking
up
to
it
i
wish
your
singing
could
tell
me
where
to
find
my
wife
chrysea
and
as
he
looked
up
he
saw
a
golden
harp
hanging
upon
the
branches
and
he
took
it
down
and
ran
his
fingers
over
the
strings
never
before
did
harp
give
forth
such
music
it
was
like
a
woman
voice
and
was
most
beautiful
but
so
sad
that
when
arasmon
heard
it
he
felt
inclined
to
cry
it
seemed
to
be
calling
for
help
but
he
could
not
understand
what
it
said
though
each
time
he
touched
the
strings
it
cried
arasmon
arasmon
i
am
here
it
is
i
chrysea
but
though
arasmon
listened
and
wondered
at
its
tones
yet
he
did
not
know
what
it
said
he
examined
it
carefully
it
was
a
beautiful
little
harp
made
of
pure
gold
and
at
the
top
was
a
pair
of
golden
hands
and
arms
clasped
together
i
will
keep
it
said
arasmon
for
i
never
yet
heard
a
harp
with
such
a
tone
and
when
chrysea
comes
she
shall
sing
to
it
but
chrysea
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
at
last
the
villagers
declared
she
must
be
lost
or
herself
have
gone
away
on
purpose
and
that
it
was
vain
to
seek
her
farther
at
this
arasmon
was
angry
and
saying
that
he
would
seek
chrysea
as
long
as
he
had
life
he
left
the
village
to
wander
over
the
whole
world
till
he
should
find
her
he
went
on
foot
and
took
with
him
the
golden
harp
he
walked
for
many
many
miles
far
away
from
the
village
and
the
moor
and
when
he
came
to
any
farmhouses
or
met
any
country
people
on
the
road
he
began
to
play
and
every
one
thronged
round
him
and
stared
in
breathless
surprise
at
his
beautiful
music
when
he
had
done
he
would
ask
them
have
you
seen
my
wife
chrysea
she
is
dressed
in
white
and
gold
and
sings
more
sweetly
than
any
of
the
birds
of
heaven
but
all
shook
their
heads
and
said
no
she
had
not
been
there
and
whenever
he
came
to
a
strange
village
where
he
had
not
been
before
he
called
chrysea
chrysea
are
you
here
but
no
chrysea
answered
only
the
harp
in
his
hands
cried
whenever
he
touched
its
strings
it
is
i
arasmon
it
is
i
chrysea
but
though
he
thought
its
notes
like
chrysea
voice
he
never
understood
them
he
wandered
for
days
and
months
and
years
through
countries
and
villages
which
he
had
never
known
before
when
night
came
and
he
found
himself
in
the
fields
alone
he
would
lie
down
upon
his
cloak
and
sleep
with
his
head
resting
upon
the
harp
and
if
by
chance
one
of
its
golden
threads
was
touched
it
would
cry
arasmon
awake
i
am
here
then
he
would
dream
that
chrysea
was
calling
him
and
would
wake
and
start
up
to
look
for
her
thinking
she
must
be
close
at
hand
one
day
towards
night
when
he
had
walked
far
and
was
very
tired
he
came
to
a
little
village
on
a
lonely
rocky
coast
by
the
sea
and
he
found
that
a
thick
mist
had
come
up
and
hung
over
the
village
so
that
he
could
barely
see
the
path
before
him
as
he
walked
but
he
found
his
way
down
on
to
the
beach
and
there
stood
a
number
of
fisherwomen
trying
to
look
through
the
mist
towards
the
sea
and
speaking
anxiously
what
is
wrong
and
for
whom
are
you
watching
good
folk
he
asked
them
we
are
watching
for
our
husbands
answered
one
they
went
out
in
their
boats
fishing
in
the
early
morning
when
it
was
quite
light
and
then
arose
this
dreadful
fog
and
they
should
have
come
back
long
ago
and
we
fear
lest
they
may
lose
their
way
in
the
darkness
and
strike
on
a
rock
and
be
drowned
i
too
have
lost
my
wife
chrysea
cried
arasmon
has
she
passed
by
here
she
had
long
golden
hair
and
her
gown
was
white
and
gold
and
she
sang
with
a
voice
like
an
angel
the
women
all
said
no
they
had
not
seen
her
but
still
they
strained
their
eyes
towards
the
sea
and
arasmon
also
began
to
watch
for
the
return
of
the
boats
they
waited
and
waited
but
they
did
not
come
and
every
moment
the
darkness
grew
thicker
and
thicker
so
that
the
women
could
not
see
each
other
faces
though
they
stood
quite
near
together
then
arasmon
took
his
harp
and
began
to
play
and
its
music
floated
over
the
water
for
miles
through
the
darkness
but
the
women
were
weeping
so
for
their
husbands
that
they
did
not
heed
it
it
is
useless
to
watch
said
one
they
can
not
steer
their
boats
in
such
a
darkness
we
shall
never
see
them
again
i
will
wait
all
night
till
morning
said
another
and
all
day
next
day
and
next
night
till
i
see
some
sign
of
the
boats
and
know
if
they
be
living
or
dead
but
as
she
stopped
speaking
there
rose
a
cry
of
here
they
are
and
two
or
three
were
pushed
on
to
the
sand
close
by
where
they
stood
and
the
women
threw
their
arms
round
their
necks
and
all
shouted
for
joy
the
fishermen
asked
who
it
was
who
had
played
the
harp
for
they
said
it
was
that
which
saved
us
we
were
far
from
land
and
it
was
so
dark
that
we
could
not
tell
whether
to
go
to
left
or
to
right
and
had
no
sign
to
guide
us
to
shore
when
of
a
sudden
we
heard
the
most
beautiful
music
and
we
followed
the
sound
and
came
in
quite
safely
was
this
good
harper
who
played
while
we
watched
said
the
women
and
one
and
all
turned
to
arasmon
and
told
him
with
tears
of
their
gratitude
and
asked
him
what
they
could
do
for
him
or
what
they
could
give
him
in
token
of
their
thankfulness
but
arasmon
shook
his
head
and
said
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
unless
you
can
tell
me
where
to
seek
my
wife
chrysea
it
is
to
find
her
i
am
wandering
and
when
the
women
shook
their
heads
and
said
again
they
knew
nothing
of
her
the
as
he
touched
them
cried
again
arasmon
arasmon
listen
to
me
it
is
i
chrysea
but
again
no
one
understood
it
and
though
all
pitied
him
no
one
could
help
him
next
morning
when
the
mist
had
cleared
away
and
the
sun
was
shining
a
little
ship
set
sail
for
foreign
countries
and
arasmon
begged
the
captain
to
take
him
in
it
that
he
might
seek
chrysea
still
farther
they
sailed
and
sailed
till
at
last
they
came
to
the
country
for
which
they
were
bound
but
they
found
the
whole
land
in
confusion
and
war
and
fighting
everywhere
and
all
the
people
were
leaving
their
homes
and
hiding
themselves
in
the
towns
for
fear
of
a
terrible
enemy
who
was
invading
them
but
no
one
hurt
arasmon
as
he
wandered
on
with
his
harp
in
his
hand
only
no
one
would
stop
to
answer
him
when
he
asked
if
chrysea
had
been
there
for
every
one
was
too
frightened
and
hurried
to
heed
him
at
last
he
came
to
the
chief
city
where
the
king
dwelt
and
here
he
found
all
the
men
building
walls
and
fortresses
and
preparing
to
defend
the
town
because
they
knew
their
enemy
was
coming
to
besiege
it
but
all
the
soldiers
were
gloomy
and
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
conquer
they
said
for
there
are
three
of
them
to
every
one
of
us
and
they
will
take
our
city
and
make
our
king
prisoner
that
night
as
the
watchmen
looked
over
the
walls
they
saw
in
the
distance
an
immense
army
marching
towards
them
and
their
swords
and
helmets
glittered
in
the
moonlight
then
they
gave
the
signal
and
the
captains
gathered
together
their
men
to
prepare
them
for
fighting
but
so
sure
were
they
of
being
beaten
that
it
was
with
difficulty
their
officers
could
bring
them
to
the
walls
it
would
be
better
said
the
soldiers
to
lay
down
our
arms
at
once
and
let
the
enemy
enter
for
then
we
should
not
lose
our
lives
as
well
as
our
city
and
our
wealth
when
arasmon
heard
this
he
sat
upon
the
walls
of
the
town
and
began
to
play
upon
his
harp
and
this
time
its
music
was
so
loud
and
clear
that
it
could
be
heard
far
and
wide
and
its
sound
was
so
exultant
and
joyous
that
when
the
soldiers
heard
it
they
raised
their
heads
and
their
fears
vanished
and
they
started
forward
shouting
and
calling
that
they
would
conquer
or
be
killed
then
the
enemy
attacked
the
city
but
the
soldiers
within
met
them
with
so
much
force
that
they
were
driven
back
and
had
to
fly
and
the
victorious
army
followed
them
and
drove
them
quite
out
of
their
country
and
arasmon
went
with
them
playing
on
his
harp
to
cheer
them
as
they
went
when
they
knew
the
victory
was
theirs
all
the
captains
wondered
what
had
caused
their
sudden
success
and
one
of
the
lieutenants
said
it
was
that
strange
harper
who
went
with
us
playing
on
his
harp
when
our
men
heard
it
they
became
as
brave
as
lions
so
the
captains
sent
for
arasmon
but
when
he
came
they
were
astonished
to
see
how
worn
and
thin
he
looked
and
could
scarcely
believe
it
was
he
who
had
made
such
wonderful
music
for
his
face
had
grown
thin
and
pale
and
there
were
gray
locks
in
his
hair
they
asked
him
what
he
would
like
to
have
saying
they
would
give
him
whatever
he
would
choose
for
the
great
service
he
had
done
them
arasmon
only
shook
his
head
and
said
there
is
nothing
i
want
that
you
can
give
me
i
am
seeking
the
whole
world
round
to
find
my
wife
chrysea
it
is
many
many
years
since
i
lost
her
we
two
were
as
happy
as
birds
on
the
bough
we
wandered
over
the
world
singing
and
playing
in
the
sunshine
but
now
she
is
gone
and
i
care
for
nothing
else
and
the
captains
looked
pityingly
at
him
for
they
all
thought
him
mad
and
could
not
understand
what
the
harp
said
when
he
played
on
it
again
and
it
cried
listen
arasmon
i
too
am
here
i
chrysea
so
arasmon
left
that
city
and
started
again
and
wandered
for
days
and
months
and
years
he
came
by
many
strange
places
and
met
with
many
strange
people
but
he
found
no
trace
of
chrysea
and
each
day
he
looked
older
and
sadder
and
thinner
at
length
he
came
to
a
country
where
the
king
loved
nothing
on
earth
so
much
as
music
so
fond
of
it
was
he
that
he
had
musicians
and
singers
by
the
score
always
living
in
his
palace
and
there
was
no
way
of
pleasing
him
so
well
as
by
sending
a
new
musician
or
singer
so
when
arasmon
came
into
the
country
and
the
people
heard
how
marvellously
he
played
they
said
at
once
let
us
take
him
to
the
king
the
poor
man
is
mad
hear
how
he
goes
on
asking
for
his
wife
but
mad
or
not
his
playing
will
delight
the
king
let
us
take
him
at
once
to
the
palace
so
though
arasmon
would
have
resisted
them
they
dragged
him
away
to
the
court
and
sent
a
messenger
to
the
king
to
say
they
had
found
a
poor
mad
wandering
harper
who
played
music
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
heard
before
the
king
and
queen
and
all
the
court
sat
feasting
when
the
messenger
came
in
saying
that
the
people
were
bringing
a
new
harper
to
play
before
his
majesty
a
new
harper
quoth
he
that
is
good
hearing
let
him
be
brought
here
to
play
to
us
at
once
so
arasmon
was
led
into
the
hall
and
up
to
the
golden
thrones
on
which
sat
the
king
and
queen
a
wonderful
hall
it
was
made
of
gold
and
silver
and
crystal
and
ivory
and
the
courtiers
dressed
in
blue
and
green
and
gold
and
diamonds
were
a
sight
to
see
behind
the
throne
were
twelve
young
maids
dressed
in
pure
white
who
sang
most
sweetly
and
behind
them
were
the
musicians
who
accompanied
them
on
every
kind
of
instrument
arasmon
had
never
in
his
life
seen
such
a
splendid
sight
come
here
cried
the
king
to
him
and
let
us
hear
you
play
and
the
singers
ceased
singing
and
the
musicians
smiled
scornfully
for
they
could
not
believe
arasmon
music
could
equal
theirs
for
he
looked
to
be
in
a
most
sorry
plight
he
had
walked
far
and
the
dust
of
the
roads
was
on
him
his
clothes
were
worn
threadbare
and
stained
and
soiled
while
his
face
was
so
thin
and
anxious
and
sad
that
it
was
pitiful
to
see
but
his
harp
of
pure
shining
gold
was
undulled
and
untarnished
he
began
to
play
and
then
all
smiles
ceased
and
the
women
began
to
weep
and
the
men
sat
and
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
when
he
had
done
the
king
started
up
and
throwing
his
arms
about
his
neck
cried
stay
with
me
you
shall
be
my
chief
musician
never
before
have
i
heard
playing
like
yours
and
whatever
you
want
i
will
give
you
but
when
he
heard
this
arasmon
knelt
on
one
knee
and
said
my
gracious
lord
i
can
not
stay
i
have
lost
my
wife
chrysea
i
must
search
all
over
the
world
till
i
find
her
ah
how
beautiful
she
was
and
how
sweetly
she
sang
her
singing
was
far
sweeter
than
even
the
music
of
my
harp
indeed
cried
the
king
then
i
too
would
fain
hear
her
but
stay
with
me
and
i
will
send
messengers
all
over
the
world
to
seek
her
far
and
near
and
they
will
find
her
much
sooner
than
you
illustration
he
began
to
play
and
then
all
smiles
p
so
arasmon
stayed
at
the
court
but
he
said
that
if
chrysea
did
not
come
soon
he
must
go
farther
to
seek
her
himself
the
king
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
clad
in
the
costliest
clothes
and
have
all
he
could
want
given
to
him
and
after
this
he
would
hear
no
music
but
arasmon
playing
so
all
the
other
musicians
were
jealous
and
wished
he
had
never
come
to
the
palace
but
the
strangest
thing
was
that
no
one
but
arasmon
could
play
upon
his
golden
harp
all
the
king
harpers
tried
and
the
king
himself
tried
also
but
when
they
touched
the
strings
there
came
from
them
a
strange
melancholy
wailing
and
no
one
but
arasmon
could
bring
out
its
beautiful
notes
but
the
courtiers
and
musicians
grew
more
and
more
angry
with
arasmon
till
at
last
they
hated
him
bitterly
and
only
wanted
to
do
him
some
harm
for
they
said
who
is
he
that
our
king
should
love
and
honour
him
before
us
after
all
it
is
not
his
playing
which
is
so
beautiful
it
is
chiefly
the
harp
on
which
he
plays
and
if
that
were
taken
from
him
he
would
be
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
and
then
they
began
to
consult
together
as
to
how
they
should
steal
his
harp
one
hot
summer
evening
arasmon
went
into
the
palace
gardens
and
sat
down
to
rest
beneath
a
large
when
a
little
way
off
he
saw
two
courtiers
talking
together
and
heard
that
they
spoke
of
him
though
they
did
not
see
him
or
know
he
was
there
the
poor
man
is
mad
said
one
of
that
there
is
little
doubt
but
mad
or
not
as
long
as
he
plays
on
his
harp
the
king
will
not
listen
to
any
one
else
the
only
way
is
to
take
the
harp
from
him
said
the
other
but
it
is
hard
to
know
how
to
get
it
away
for
he
will
never
let
it
go
out
of
his
hands
we
must
take
it
from
him
when
he
is
sleeping
said
the
first
certainly
said
the
other
and
then
arasmon
heard
them
settle
how
and
when
they
would
go
to
his
room
at
night
to
steal
his
harp
he
sat
still
till
they
were
gone
and
then
he
rose
and
grasping
it
tenderly
turned
from
the
palace
and
walked
away
through
the
garden
gates
i
have
lost
chrysea
he
said
and
now
they
would
take
from
me
even
my
harp
the
only
thing
i
have
to
love
in
all
this
world
but
i
will
go
away
far
off
where
they
will
never
find
me
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
he
ran
with
all
his
might
and
never
rested
till
he
was
far
away
on
a
lonely
hill
with
no
one
near
to
see
him
the
stars
were
beginning
to
shine
though
it
was
not
yet
dark
arasmon
sat
on
a
stone
and
looked
at
the
country
far
and
near
he
could
hear
the
sheep
bells
tinkling
around
him
and
far
far
off
in
the
distance
he
could
see
the
city
and
the
palace
he
had
left
then
he
began
to
play
on
his
harp
and
as
he
played
the
sheep
stopped
browsing
and
drew
near
him
to
listen
the
stars
grew
brighter
and
the
evening
darker
and
he
saw
a
woman
carrying
a
child
coming
up
the
hill
she
looked
pale
and
tired
but
her
face
was
very
happy
as
she
sat
down
not
far
from
arasmon
and
listened
to
his
playing
whilst
she
looked
eagerly
across
the
hill
as
if
she
watched
for
some
one
who
was
coming
presently
she
turned
and
said
how
beautifully
you
play
i
never
heard
music
like
it
before
but
what
makes
you
look
so
sad
are
you
unhappy
yes
said
arasmon
i
am
very
miserable
i
lost
my
wife
chrysea
many
years
ago
and
now
i
do
know
where
she
can
be
it
is
a
year
since
i
have
seen
my
husband
said
the
woman
he
went
to
the
war
a
year
ago
but
now
there
is
peace
and
he
is
coming
back
and
he
will
come
over
this
hill
it
was
just
here
we
parted
and
now
i
am
come
to
meet
him
how
happy
you
must
be
said
arasmon
i
shall
never
see
chrysea
again
and
as
he
spoke
he
struck
a
chord
on
the
harp
which
cried
o
arasmon
my
husband
why
do
you
not
know
me
it
is
i
chrysea
do
not
say
that
continued
the
woman
you
will
find
her
some
day
why
do
you
sit
here
was
it
here
you
parted
from
her
then
arasmon
told
her
how
they
had
gone
to
a
strange
desolate
village
and
rested
there
for
the
night
and
in
the
morning
chrysea
was
gone
and
that
he
had
wandered
all
over
the
world
looking
for
her
ever
since
i
think
you
are
foolish
said
the
woman
perhaps
your
wife
has
been
waiting
for
you
at
that
village
all
this
time
i
would
go
back
to
the
place
where
i
parted
from
her
if
i
were
you
and
wait
there
till
she
returns
how
could
i
meet
my
husband
if
i
did
not
come
to
the
spot
where
we
last
were
together
we
might
both
wander
on
for
ever
and
never
find
each
other
and
now
see
here
he
is
coming
and
she
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
ran
to
meet
a
soldier
who
was
walking
up
the
hill
arasmon
watched
them
as
they
met
and
kissed
and
saw
the
father
lift
the
child
in
his
arms
then
the
three
walked
over
the
hill
together
and
when
they
were
gone
he
sat
down
and
wept
bitterly
what
was
it
she
said
he
said
that
i
ought
to
go
back
to
the
spot
where
we
parted
she
will
not
be
there
but
i
will
go
and
die
at
the
place
where
i
last
saw
her
so
again
he
grasped
his
harp
and
started
he
travelled
many
days
and
weeks
by
land
and
sea
till
late
one
day
he
came
in
sight
of
the
hill
on
which
stood
the
little
village
but
at
first
he
could
not
believe
that
he
had
come
to
the
right
place
so
changed
did
all
appear
he
stopped
and
looked
around
him
in
astonishment
he
stood
in
a
shady
lane
the
arching
trees
met
over
his
head
the
banks
were
full
of
spring
flowers
and
either
side
of
the
hedge
were
fields
full
of
young
green
corn
can
this
be
the
wretched
bare
road
down
which
we
walked
together
i
would
indeed
it
were
and
that
she
were
with
me
now
said
he
when
he
looked
across
to
the
village
the
change
seemed
greater
still
there
were
many
more
cottages
and
they
were
trim
and
well
kept
standing
in
neat
gardens
full
of
flowers
he
heard
the
cheerful
voices
of
the
peasants
and
the
laughter
of
the
village
children
the
whole
place
seemed
to
be
full
of
life
and
happiness
he
stopped
again
upon
the
mound
where
he
and
chrysea
had
first
played
and
sung
it
is
many
many
a
long
year
since
i
was
here
he
said
time
has
changed
all
things
strangely
but
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
is
the
more
altered
this
village
or
i
for
then
it
was
sunk
in
poverty
and
wretchedness
and
now
it
has
gained
happiness
and
wealth
and
i
who
was
so
happy
and
glad
now
am
and
worn
i
have
lost
my
only
wealth
my
wife
chrysea
it
was
just
here
she
stood
and
sang
and
now
i
shall
never
see
her
again
or
hear
her
singing
there
came
past
him
a
young
girl
driving
some
cows
and
he
turned
and
spoke
to
her
tell
me
i
beg
he
said
is
not
your
village
much
changed
of
late
years
i
was
here
long
ago
but
i
can
not
now
think
it
the
same
place
for
this
is
as
bright
and
flourishing
a
town
as
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
remember
it
only
as
a
dreary
village
where
the
grass
never
grew
oh
said
the
girl
then
you
were
here
in
our
bad
time
but
we
do
not
now
like
to
speak
of
that
for
fear
our
troubles
should
return
folks
say
we
were
is
so
long
ago
that
i
can
scarcely
remember
it
for
i
was
quite
a
little
child
then
but
a
wandering
musician
and
his
wife
set
us
free
at
least
everything
began
to
mend
after
they
came
and
now
we
think
they
must
have
been
angels
from
heaven
for
next
day
they
went
and
we
have
never
seen
them
since
it
was
i
and
my
wife
chrysea
cried
arasmon
have
you
seen
her
has
she
been
here
i
have
sought
all
over
the
world
ever
since
but
i
can
not
find
her
and
now
i
fear
lest
she
be
dead
the
girl
stared
at
him
in
surprise
you
you
poor
old
man
of
what
are
you
talking
you
must
surely
be
mad
to
say
such
things
these
musicians
were
the
most
beautiful
people
upon
the
earth
and
they
were
young
and
dressed
in
shining
white
and
gold
and
you
are
old
and
gray
and
ragged
and
surely
you
are
very
ill
too
for
you
seem
to
be
so
weak
that
you
can
scarcely
walk
come
home
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
food
and
rest
till
you
are
better
arasmon
shook
his
head
i
am
seeking
chrysea
he
said
and
i
will
rest
no
more
till
i
have
found
her
and
the
girl
seeing
that
he
was
determined
left
him
alone
and
went
on
her
way
driving
her
cows
before
her
when
she
had
gone
arasmon
sat
by
the
wayside
and
wept
as
though
his
heart
would
break
it
is
too
true
he
said
i
am
so
old
and
worn
that
when
i
find
her
she
will
not
know
me
and
as
he
again
fell
his
hand
struck
the
and
they
cried
i
have
watched
you
through
all
these
years
my
arasmon
take
comfort
i
am
very
near
and
his
tears
ceased
and
he
was
soothed
by
the
voice
of
the
harp
though
he
knew
not
why
then
he
rose
i
will
go
to
the
moor
he
said
and
look
for
the
tree
on
which
i
found
my
harp
and
that
will
be
my
last
for
surely
my
strength
will
carry
me
no
farther
so
he
tottered
slowly
on
calling
as
he
went
in
a
weak
voice
chrysea
my
chrysea
are
you
here
i
have
sought
you
over
the
world
since
you
left
me
and
now
that
i
am
old
and
like
to
die
i
am
come
to
seek
you
where
we
parted
when
he
came
upon
the
moor
he
wondered
again
at
the
change
of
all
the
country
round
he
thought
of
the
charred
blackened
waste
on
which
he
had
stood
before
and
now
he
looked
with
amazement
at
the
golden
gorse
the
purple
heather
so
thick
that
he
could
scarcely
pick
his
way
amongst
it
it
is
a
beautiful
place
now
he
said
but
i
liked
it
better
years
ago
deserted
and
desolate
though
it
was
for
my
chrysea
was
here
there
were
so
many
trees
upon
the
common
that
he
could
not
tell
which
was
the
one
on
which
his
harp
had
hung
but
unable
to
go
any
farther
he
staggered
and
sank
down
beneath
a
large
in
whose
branches
a
blackbird
was
singing
most
sweetly
the
sun
was
setting
just
as
of
yore
when
he
had
found
his
harp
and
most
of
the
birds
songs
were
over
but
this
one
bird
still
sang
sweet
and
clear
and
arasmon
tired
and
weak
though
he
was
raised
his
head
and
listened
i
never
heard
bird
sing
like
that
he
said
what
is
the
tune
it
sings
i
will
play
it
on
my
harp
before
i
die
and
with
what
strength
remained
to
him
he
reached
forth
his
trembling
hand
and
grasping
his
harp
struck
upon
it
the
notes
of
the
bird
song
then
he
fell
back
exhausted
and
his
eyes
closed
at
once
the
harp
slid
from
his
hand
and
chrysea
stood
beside
him
chrysea
dressed
as
of
old
in
shining
white
and
gold
with
bright
hair
and
eyes
arasmon
she
cried
see
it
is
i
chrysea
but
arasmon
did
not
move
then
she
raised
her
voice
and
sang
more
sweetly
than
the
bird
overhead
and
arasmon
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
chrysea
cried
he
i
have
found
my
wife
chrysea
and
he
laid
his
head
on
her
bosom
and
died
and
when
chrysea
saw
it
her
heart
broke
and
she
lay
beside
him
and
died
without
a
word
in
the
morning
when
some
of
the
villagers
crossed
the
common
they
saw
arasmon
and
chrysea
lying
beneath
the
in
each
other
arms
and
drew
near
them
thinking
they
were
asleep
but
when
they
saw
their
faces
they
knew
they
were
dead
then
an
old
man
stooped
and
looked
at
chrysea
and
said
surely
it
is
the
woman
who
came
to
us
and
sang
long
ago
when
we
were
in
our
troubles
and
though
he
is
sadly
changed
and
worn
it
is
like
her
husband
who
played
for
her
singing
then
came
the
girl
who
had
driven
the
cows
and
told
them
how
she
had
met
arasmon
and
all
he
had
said
to
her
he
searched
everywhere
for
his
wife
he
said
said
she
i
am
glad
he
has
found
her
where
could
she
be
would
that
we
had
known
it
was
he
said
they
all
how
we
would
have
greeted
him
but
see
he
looks
quite
content
and
as
if
he
wished
nothing
more
since
he
has
found
his
wife
chrysea

the
heart
of
princess
joan
illustration
long
ago
in
the
days
of
fairies
there
lived
a
king
and
queen
who
were
rich
and
happy
but
the
queen
was
a
proud
haughty
woman
and
disliked
every
one
more
powerful
than
herself
and
most
of
all
she
hated
the
fairy
folk
and
could
not
bear
them
to
come
to
the
castle
where
she
and
the
king
dwelt
time
passed
and
the
queen
had
a
little
baby
a
daughter
whom
they
called
joan
and
the
bells
were
rung
and
there
were
great
rejoicings
all
over
the
country
and
the
king
and
queen
were
happy
as
the
day
is
long
one
day
as
the
queen
sat
by
the
cradle
of
the
little
princess
watching
it
she
said
my
pretty
babe
when
you
are
grown
to
be
a
woman
you
will
be
rich
and
beautiful
and
you
shall
marry
some
young
prince
who
will
love
you
dearly
and
then
in
your
turn
be
queen
and
have
a
fine
palace
and
jewels
and
lands
to
your
heart
content
scarcely
had
she
done
speaking
when
she
heard
a
little
noise
beside
her
and
looking
up
saw
a
woman
dressed
in
yellow
from
head
to
foot
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
cradle
she
wore
a
yellow
cap
which
covered
her
head
completely
so
that
no
hair
was
seen
and
her
eyes
which
looked
cunning
and
fierce
were
yellow
as
her
dress
and
how
do
you
know
queen
that
your
child
will
be
so
happy
whose
help
will
you
seek
to
get
her
all
these
fine
things
said
the
strange
woman
i
will
ask
no
one
help
said
the
queen
haughtily
for
i
am
queen
of
the
land
and
can
have
what
i
please
the
yellow
woman
laughed
and
said
do
be
too
sure
proud
queen
but
the
next
night
that
the
moon
is
bright
guard
well
the
princess
when
the
clock
strikes
twelve
lest
aught
of
her
be
stolen
from
her
no
thief
shall
come
near
her
cried
the
queen
but
ere
she
had
done
speaking
the
woman
had
vanished
and
the
queen
knew
it
was
a
fairy
the
sky
that
night
was
dark
and
overcast
and
no
moon
to
be
seen
and
the
next
night
was
the
same
but
the
third
night
the
moon
shone
bright
and
clear
and
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
queen
awoke
and
looked
at
the
baby
who
was
sleeping
peacefully
in
its
cradle
but
the
strokes
of
the
clock
she
heard
a
faint
whistling
outside
the
window
which
grew
louder
and
fuller
each
moment
was
as
if
some
one
whistled
to
decoy
away
a
bird
and
on
hearing
it
the
baby
awoke
and
began
to
cry
bitterly
the
queen
could
not
quiet
her
try
how
she
might
at
last
the
little
one
gave
one
scream
louder
than
all
the
others
and
then
lay
quite
still
and
at
that
moment
the
queen
saw
something
flutter
across
the
room
like
a
tiny
bird
with
pink
soft
feathers
it
flew
straight
out
of
the
window
and
the
whistling
ceased
and
all
again
was
quiet
as
before
the
queen
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
looked
at
it
anxiously
by
the
light
of
the
moon
but
it
looked
well
and
slept
calmly
so
its
mother
placed
it
in
its
cradle
and
tried
to
forget
the
yellow
fairy
and
the
whistling
the
nurse
of
the
princess
joan
was
a
very
wise
old
woman
who
knew
a
great
deal
of
fairies
and
their
ways
and
as
the
child
grew
up
she
watched
her
with
an
anxious
face
she
is
under
a
charm
she
said
though
what
it
is
i
do
know
but
before
she
is
a
woman
they
will
see
how
different
she
is
from
others
the
nurse
words
proved
to
be
true
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
little
girl
like
the
princess
nothing
troubled
her
she
never
shed
one
tear
if
she
were
angry
she
would
stamp
her
feet
and
her
eyes
would
flash
but
she
never
wept
and
she
loved
nobody
when
her
little
dog
died
she
laughed
outright
when
the
king
her
father
went
to
the
war
it
did
not
grieve
her
and
when
he
returned
she
was
no
happier
than
she
had
been
when
he
was
away
she
never
kissed
her
mother
or
her
ladies
and
when
they
said
they
loved
her
she
stared
at
them
and
asked
what
they
meant
at
this
the
ladies
were
angry
with
her
and
chid
her
for
being
but
the
old
nurse
always
stopped
them
saying
is
not
her
you
should
blame
she
is
enchanted
but
is
not
her
fault
princess
joan
grew
up
and
was
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
land
it
was
many
long
years
since
any
one
so
fair
had
been
seen
but
for
all
that
her
mother
mourned
over
her
sorely
and
her
eyes
were
red
with
crying
for
her
beautiful
daughter
who
had
never
yet
wept
one
tear
herself
the
neighbouring
country
was
governed
by
a
king
and
queen
who
had
only
one
son
named
michael
whom
everybody
loved
dearly
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
and
as
good
as
he
was
handsome
he
was
as
gracious
to
the
poorest
beggar
as
to
the
greatest
lord
and
all
the
poor
folk
came
to
him
to
tell
him
their
troubles
if
they
thought
they
were
badly
treated
and
because
he
was
brave
and
handsome
also
the
court
people
loved
him
as
well
as
the
peasants
in
this
country
there
stood
on
a
high
hill
a
round
tower
and
at
the
top
of
it
lived
an
old
wizard
no
man
knew
his
age
for
he
had
dwelt
there
for
hundreds
of
years
and
no
one
knew
how
the
tower
had
been
built
for
it
was
made
of
one
huge
stone
and
there
were
no
joins
in
it
at
all
the
king
and
queen
were
afraid
of
the
old
magician
and
never
went
near
him
indeed
no
one
in
all
the
country
had
ever
ventured
to
climb
the
tower
and
see
the
old
man
at
his
work
except
prince
michael
who
knew
the
old
sorcerer
well
and
did
not
fear
him
at
all
but
went
up
and
down
the
tower
as
he
chose
one
bright
moonlight
night
it
chanced
that
the
prince
found
himself
alone
on
the
and
seeing
a
bright
light
shining
from
the
top
of
the
tower
he
resolved
to
enter
and
pay
the
old
man
a
visit
so
he
went
to
a
little
door
and
pushing
it
open
stepped
into
a
narrow
dark
winding
staircase
that
went
straight
up
the
centre
to
the
room
at
the
top
in
which
the
wizard
dwelt
the
staircase
was
pitch
dark
for
there
were
no
windows
moreover
it
was
so
narrow
that
only
one
person
could
walk
in
it
at
a
time
but
prince
michael
knew
the
way
quite
well
and
climbed
and
climbed
till
he
saw
a
chink
of
light
and
at
last
trod
through
a
little
doorway
into
the
room
in
which
the
sorcerer
sat
this
room
was
as
light
as
day
for
it
was
lit
by
a
lamp
which
the
old
man
himself
had
made
and
in
which
no
oil
or
wick
was
burning
but
every
day
it
was
filled
with
sunbeams
and
held
them
at
night
after
the
sun
had
set
so
the
whole
room
was
brilliant
and
in
the
middle
sat
the
wizard
who
was
a
wonderful
old
man
to
look
on
for
he
was
all
white
his
beard
was
white
as
snow
and
from
afar
you
could
not
tell
which
was
beard
and
which
gown
but
when
you
came
near
you
saw
that
the
beard
flowed
nearly
to
his
feet
and
his
skin
was
as
white
as
either
beard
or
gown
and
his
eyes
were
quite
colourless
but
as
bright
as
two
candles
when
michael
entered
he
sat
looking
at
an
enormous
book
full
of
coloured
pictures
of
little
men
and
women
about
three
inches
high
each
they
were
not
like
other
pictures
for
they
walked
and
moved
over
the
page
as
though
they
were
alive
it
is
i
father
what
book
are
you
looking
at
said
michael
stepping
up
to
the
old
man
side
in
this
book
said
the
wizard
i
keep
the
portraits
of
all
the
men
and
women
in
the
world
and
they
are
living
portraits
too
for
they
move
and
look
just
like
the
originals
that
must
be
very
amusing
cried
michael
pray
show
me
the
portraits
of
all
the
kings
and
queens
and
princesses
this
will
be
delightful
and
he
knelt
down
by
the
old
man
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
sorcerer
muttered
to
himself
and
turned
over
the
pages
and
then
stopped
at
one
on
which
michael
saw
little
figures
of
kings
and
queens
of
all
sorts
some
of
which
he
knew
and
some
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
illustration
is
their
daughter
princess
joan
said
the
wizard
with
a
sigh
but
do
not
look
at
her
my
son
for
she
will
bring
nothing
but
trouble
to
all
who
know
p
there
he
cried
is
old
king
réné
who
came
to
our
court
last
year
and
that
is
queen
constance
and
that
is
their
nephew
prince
guilbert
who
will
be
king
when
they
are
dead
and
here
are
our
neighbours
the
king
and
queen
of
the
next
country
and
oh
my
father
who
is
this
lovely
princess
next
to
them
is
their
daughter
princess
joan
said
the
wizard
with
a
sigh
but
do
not
look
at
her
my
son
for
she
will
bring
nothing
but
trouble
to
all
who
know
her
i
do
care
if
she
bring
trouble
or
happiness
cried
the
prince
but
for
certain
she
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
and
he
seized
the
book
and
looked
long
at
the
tiny
figure
of
the
princess
truly
it
was
very
beautiful
it
was
dressed
in
white
with
a
golden
girdle
round
the
waist
and
a
wreath
of
golden
daisies
on
its
head
and
as
michael
looked
it
turned
upon
the
pages
and
smiled
at
him
till
he
smiled
back
again
and
could
not
move
his
eyes
from
it
when
the
wizard
saw
this
he
took
the
book
from
the
young
man
hands
and
hid
it
away
saying
think
no
more
of
princess
joan
however
beautiful
she
be
or
one
day
you
will
rue
it
dearly
prince
michael
made
no
answer
but
he
thought
all
the
more
of
the
little
picture
of
the
princess
after
he
had
left
the
tower
and
returned
to
the
palace
he
could
not
forget
her
but
dreamt
of
her
all
night
and
thought
of
her
all
day
next
morning
he
went
to
the
king
and
said
my
father
i
am
come
to
beg
that
you
will
send
to
the
king
of
the
next
country
and
ask
if
i
may
have
his
daughter
princess
joan
for
my
wife
for
i
have
seen
her
portrait
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
whom
i
love
so
well
when
the
king
heard
this
he
was
delighted
our
good
neighbours
he
said
are
rich
and
powerful
and
it
will
be
a
capital
thing
for
our
son
to
marry
their
daughter
so
he
at
once
sent
off
an
ambassador
to
beg
for
the
hand
of
princess
joan
for
prince
michael
joan
father
and
mother
were
delighted
with
the
offer
and
at
once
resolved
to
accept
it
but
the
queen
heart
sank
within
her
for
she
thought
our
poor
joan
is
not
like
any
other
maid
who
ever
lived
before
and
perhaps
when
prince
michael
sees
her
and
finds
this
out
he
will
refuse
to
wed
her
after
all
but
she
said
nothing
of
her
fears
and
the
ambassador
returned
to
the
court
loaded
with
presents
and
bearing
a
message
of
acceptance
till
his
return
prince
michael
knew
no
peace
or
rest
but
wandered
about
among
the
hills
by
himself
thinking
of
joan
and
still
in
his
heart
he
wondered
what
the
magician
had
meant
when
he
said
that
if
he
thought
much
of
princess
joan
one
day
he
would
rue
it
at
last
he
said
to
himself
i
will
disguise
myself
as
a
poor
man
and
go
and
see
my
princess
for
myself
before
the
ambassador
returns
then
shall
i
know
what
the
wizard
means
so
he
dressed
himself
as
a
peasant
and
started
alone
without
telling
any
one
whither
he
went
and
he
travelled
day
and
night
till
he
came
to
the
country
where
joan
dwelt
and
to
her
father
palace
then
he
walked
near
the
palace
gardens
and
no
one
noticed
him
and
he
saw
a
group
of
lovely
ladies
who
sat
together
on
the
grass
his
heart
beat
high
as
he
looked
at
them
for
in
their
midst
most
beautiful
of
all
sat
the
princess
joan
her
yellow
hair
fell
to
her
waist
her
face
was
like
a
blush
rose
and
her
eyes
were
blue
as
but
when
she
lifted
them
he
saw
that
they
were
clear
and
hard
as
glass
and
her
voice
when
she
spoke
was
like
a
bright
cold
bell
there
ran
up
to
her
a
little
crying
bitterly
and
said
i
beg
of
you
princess
to
let
me
return
to
my
own
home
for
a
time
for
my
father
the
huntsman
has
broken
his
leg
and
is
very
why
should
you
cry
for
that
said
the
princess
is
your
father
and
not
you
that
is
hurt
but
you
may
go
for
when
you
cry
and
your
eyes
look
red
you
are
ugly
and
i
do
like
to
see
you
so
be
sure
that
when
you
return
you
are
pretty
and
bright
as
ever
when
her
ladies
heard
her
they
looked
angry
but
no
one
spoke
and
the
little
maid
went
crying
away
up
there
came
a
groom
from
the
palace
and
said
your
royal
highness
the
horse
that
you
rode
yesterday
is
dead
and
we
think
it
is
because
you
would
ride
so
far
when
it
was
already
tired
as
we
told
you
dead
is
it
cried
the
princess
then
see
quickly
and
get
me
another
that
i
may
ride
again
and
be
sure
this
time
that
it
is
a
good
strong
horse
or
it
may
give
way
beneath
me
and
so
my
ride
be
shortened
the
groom
went
away
muttering
and
the
princess
ladies
looked
even
graver
than
before
but
the
princess
own
face
was
bright
as
a
summer
sky
and
she
talked
on
without
heeding
their
sad
looks
prince
michael
turned
away
with
a
heavy
heart
the
magician
spoke
truly
he
said
to
himself
and
there
will
be
nothing
but
sorrow
for
all
those
who
love
my
poor
princess
joan
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
her
and
return
at
once
to
his
own
home
and
still
he
remained
near
the
palace
and
for
some
days
watched
her
unnoticed
when
she
walked
and
rode
and
listened
to
all
she
said
and
each
day
he
grieved
more
and
more
for
she
never
said
one
kind
loving
word
to
any
one
yet
each
day
when
he
saw
how
beautiful
she
was
he
loved
her
more
and
more
when
he
again
returned
to
his
own
home
he
found
great
rejoicings
everywhere
for
the
ambassador
had
returned
with
a
message
from
father
promising
she
should
marry
the
prince
and
everywhere
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
entry
of
the
princess
to
her
new
home
and
now
my
son
said
the
king
all
is
arranged
for
you
to
journey
in
state
to
her
father
court
and
bring
back
your
bride
so
now
i
hope
that
you
are
happy
and
wish
for
nothing
more
on
hearing
this
prince
michael
face
was
sad
and
grave
and
his
father
and
mother
wondered
what
ailed
him
but
he
said
to
himself
i
will
never
marry
my
joan
till
she
loves
me
as
i
do
her
and
how
can
she
ever
do
that
when
she
loves
no
one
not
even
her
own
father
and
mother
at
the
court
of
joan
father
grand
preparations
had
been
made
and
all
was
in
excitement
when
prince
michael
arrived
with
servants
and
horses
and
presents
for
the
bride
the
king
and
queen
sat
in
state
to
receive
him
and
beside
them
was
joan
and
she
looked
so
beautiful
in
a
dress
as
blue
as
her
eyes
that
every
one
said
how
glad
he
will
be
when
he
sees
how
lovely
she
is
there
was
a
blowing
of
trumpets
and
ringing
of
bells
when
prince
michael
followed
by
his
attendants
entered
and
the
king
and
queen
and
all
the
courtiers
rose
he
passed
up
the
hall
to
the
thrones
on
which
they
sat
and
kneeling
on
one
knee
kissed
their
hands
and
last
he
kissed
the
hand
of
the
princess
but
he
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
ground
or
look
in
her
face
and
his
own
was
so
sad
that
the
people
whispered
to
each
other
and
said
what
is
the
matter
and
why
does
he
look
so
unhappy
surely
he
ought
to
be
content
when
he
sees
how
beautiful
she
is
at
night
when
the
merrymakings
were
over
the
prince
sent
a
message
to
the
queen
begging
she
would
speak
with
him
alone
and
when
she
heard
this
her
heart
sank
and
she
thought
he
must
know
that
there
is
something
amiss
with
joan
and
perhaps
he
comes
to
say
he
will
not
marry
her
after
all
so
she
sent
every
one
away
except
the
old
nurse
and
bid
the
prince
to
come
when
he
came
in
and
saw
her
sad
looks
he
said
you
have
guessed
then
queen
why
i
come
to
speak
to
you
tell
me
truly
what
ails
princess
joan
and
why
is
she
unlike
any
one
i
ever
saw
the
queen
cried
bitterly
and
said
i
know
not
would
i
did
but
the
old
nurse
said
i
know
and
will
tell
you
prince
princess
joan
is
under
a
spell
a
bad
fairy
enchanted
her
when
she
was
a
tiny
baby
and
till
this
charm
is
broken
she
will
never
be
like
other
people
and
what
is
the
charm
asked
the
prince
nay
that
i
do
know
said
the
nurse
then
she
told
michael
of
the
yellow
woman
and
the
whistling
the
queen
had
heard
at
night
and
as
he
listened
the
prince
sighed
and
said
there
is
no
charm
which
can
not
be
broken
if
one
does
but
know
how
but
this
is
hard
to
do
for
we
do
not
know
what
the
spell
is
or
who
is
the
fairy
who
cast
it
but
bid
the
people
cease
their
preparations
queen
and
stop
the
wedding
rejoicings
for
there
will
be
no
wedding
no
not
till
i
have
found
the
fairy
who
has
wronged
my
joan
and
made
her
set
her
free
i
shall
start
at
break
of
day
and
journey
to
the
farthest
ends
of
the
world
to
search
for
what
can
break
the
charm
but
i
pray
queen
that
joan
may
wait
for
me
for
seven
years
and
if
when
they
are
past
i
have
not
returned
and
you
have
heard
nothing
of
me
you
must
think
that
i
am
dead
and
gone
and
marry
her
to
whom
you
will
for
if
i
be
alive
i
will
return
before
then
and
till
seven
years
are
past
remember
that
joan
is
still
mine
on
hearing
this
the
queen
wept
still
more
and
begged
the
prince
either
to
remain
and
marry
joan
or
to
leave
her
and
return
to
his
home
and
forget
her
but
if
he
wandered
away
to
lands
of
goblins
and
fairies
no
one
would
know
what
had
become
of
him
and
he
would
never
find
the
fairy
who
had
charmed
joan
or
learn
how
to
break
the
spell
but
prince
michael
only
shook
his
head
and
said
i
have
sworn
that
i
will
not
marry
joan
till
she
loves
me
as
i
do
her
neither
can
i
return
to
my
home
and
forget
her
so
bid
her
be
ready
at
dawn
to
bid
me
farewell
and
tell
none
that
i
am
going
till
i
have
gone
also
i
beg
you
to
send
a
messenger
to
my
father
and
mother
to
tell
them
why
i
do
not
return
for
i
will
not
see
them
first
lest
they
too
should
try
to
dissuade
me
the
queen
said
no
more
but
she
cried
very
bitterly
but
the
old
nurse
smiled
and
nodded
to
michael
and
said
you
do
well
you
are
a
noble
prince
and
would
well
deserve
our
love
next
morning
at
break
of
day
the
queen
awoke
the
princess
and
bade
her
rise
for
prince
michael
waited
to
bid
her
the
prince
stood
at
the
door
of
the
palace
and
when
princess
joan
came
out
looking
lovelier
than
ever
in
the
dim
morning
light
the
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
he
thought
most
likely
i
shall
never
see
her
again
and
then
she
will
never
know
how
much
i
have
loved
her
joan
he
said
do
not
quite
forget
me
for
seven
years
for
perhaps
i
may
yet
come
back
and
marry
you
and
why
do
you
go
said
joan
i
had
thought
there
would
be
a
grand
wedding
and
i
should
have
all
the
gifts
that
are
being
prepared
for
me
and
now
i
shall
have
nothing
but
if
go
you
must
michael
sighed
as
he
mounted
his
horse
and
bade
her
farewell
when
he
looked
back
at
the
palace
the
queen
and
joan
still
stood
at
the
door
and
the
queen
sobbed
but
princess
joan
looked
quite
happy
and
contented
and
smiled
brightly
prince
michael
rode
and
rode
till
he
came
to
his
own
home
and
then
he
turned
at
once
to
the
tower
in
which
dwelt
the
magician
he
climbed
the
tower
and
found
the
old
man
sitting
alone
as
before
but
he
had
no
book
before
him
and
he
looked
very
grave
i
know
why
you
are
come
he
said
as
soon
as
michael
entered
the
room
so
you
have
seen
princess
joan
and
do
you
still
wish
to
marry
her
i
will
marry
her
or
no
one
said
michael
but
not
till
i
have
found
out
who
has
bewitched
her
and
have
broken
the
charm
you
will
have
to
search
far
for
that
said
the
wizard
and
it
may
be
years
ere
you
could
set
her
free
forget
her
my
son
and
return
to
your
own
home
and
do
not
waste
your
life
in
a
fruitless
quest
i
will
seek
to
break
the
charm
even
if
it
take
my
whole
life
said
michael
but
tell
me
what
it
is
and
how
shall
i
find
out
how
to
break
it
a
fairy
has
stolen
her
heart
said
the
wizard
and
that
is
why
she
loves
no
one
and
can
feel
no
sorrow
she
has
no
heart
with
which
to
love
or
pity
and
till
it
is
found
and
restored
to
her
she
will
be
hard
and
cold
as
stone
the
fairy
swore
she
would
be
revenged
on
her
mother
for
her
pride
and
so
she
is
then
i
will
go
and
seek
her
heart
and
bring
it
back
to
her
said
michael
but
where
shall
i
look
for
it
tell
me
at
least
where
has
the
fairy
hidden
it
she
has
taken
it
to
a
castle
in
which
are
kept
all
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
that
fairies
steal
or
that
they
themselves
throw
away
and
this
castle
is
very
far
from
here
moreover
it
is
guarded
by
an
old
gnome
who
is
spiteful
and
cruel
and
who
pays
no
heed
to
those
who
beg
him
to
let
them
enter
give
up
the
princess
and
return
to
your
home
for
if
you
go
you
will
only
die
or
be
enchanted
like
poor
princess
joan
nevertheless
i
shall
go
said
michael
so
tell
me
what
path
to
take
and
i
will
start
at
once
on
hearing
this
the
sorcerer
took
from
his
bosom
a
small
round
piece
of
glass
and
gave
it
to
the
young
man
take
this
he
said
it
is
all
that
i
can
give
you
to
help
you
and
through
it
you
must
look
at
the
stars
and
you
will
see
that
they
are
all
of
different
colours
blue
green
red
and
yellow
look
for
the
one
which
is
the
deepest
brightest
red
and
follow
it
it
will
lead
you
many
miles
both
by
land
and
sea
but
follow
steadily
and
let
nothing
turn
you
from
your
course
and
you
will
surely
come
to
the
castle
wherein
is
imprisoned
the
heart
of
your
princess
the
prince
thanked
the
magician
and
took
the
glass
then
bidding
him
he
left
the
strangely
lighted
chamber
and
went
down
the
dark
staircase
and
stood
again
on
the
hill
outside
with
the
dark
sky
overhead
filled
with
shining
stars
michael
raised
the
glass
and
looked
at
them
through
it
and
then
he
almost
shouted
with
surprise
for
they
looked
wonderful
they
were
like
jewels
of
all
colours
green
blue
yellow
pink
and
in
the
south
was
one
of
a
deep
glowing
red
like
a
rose
and
michael
knew
that
that
was
the
star
he
must
follow
then
he
looked
back
towards
his
father
palace
farewell
he
said
some
day
i
will
return
and
bring
with
me
my
princess
joan
so
he
set
off
and
journeyed
and
journeyed
till
he
had
reached
towns
and
villages
which
he
had
never
seen
before
all
that
night
he
travelled
while
the
stars
shone
and
he
could
see
the
rosy
star
to
follow
but
when
the
stars
grew
pale
and
the
sun
rose
and
people
began
to
wake
up
and
turn
to
their
work
he
lay
down
under
a
tree
and
slept
soundly
when
he
woke
the
day
was
almost
done
and
the
sun
was
sinking
so
he
went
to
a
little
town
near
and
bought
food
and
rested
till
again
the
stars
shone
in
the
sky
then
he
rose
and
went
on
all
night
still
following
the
crimson
star
so
passed
many
days
and
nights
and
he
journeyed
through
strange
lands
and
his
heart
sank
when
he
thought
so
may
i
wander
all
round
the
world
and
come
no
nearer
to
the
star
or
to
the
castle
where
they
keep
the
heart
of
my
poor
joan
at
last
he
came
to
the
and
in
front
of
him
lay
a
great
cold
sea
and
beyond
it
he
saw
no
sign
of
land
but
the
star
shone
right
over
it
and
he
knew
that
he
must
cross
if
he
still
would
follow
it
it
was
in
the
evening
the
sun
had
set
but
some
fishermen
still
remained
on
the
beach
resting
beside
their
boats
michael
went
up
to
them
and
taking
some
money
from
his
pocket
asked
for
how
much
they
would
sell
him
one
of
their
boats
at
this
the
men
looked
surprised
and
one
of
them
said
why
do
you
wish
to
buy
a
boat
we
use
them
to
fish
near
the
shore
but
no
boat
or
ship
has
ever
crossed
this
sea
for
no
one
knows
what
land
is
beyond
then
i
will
be
the
first
to
find
out
said
michael
tell
me
how
much
you
want
and
give
me
your
largest
boat
on
this
the
men
muttered
together
and
one
said
he
is
mad
yes
said
another
but
his
money
is
good
for
all
that
let
the
madman
have
his
way
it
will
hurt
him
not
us
so
they
gave
michael
their
best
boat
and
he
paid
them
well
and
he
set
sail
and
steered
where
the
red
star
shone
he
sailed
all
night
till
he
had
left
every
trace
of
land
behind
him
and
saw
no
shore
in
front
only
the
cold
gray
sea
on
every
side
by
day
he
kept
the
boat
still
afraid
lest
he
should
get
out
of
the
track
of
the
star
but
when
the
second
night
came
he
was
so
weary
that
in
spite
of
himself
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
found
the
sun
had
risen
and
his
boat
was
drifting
close
to
land
it
was
a
flat
lonely
shore
without
trees
or
grass
growing
in
sight
and
facing
him
was
an
immense
castle
it
was
built
of
black
marble
and
a
more
gloomy
place
could
not
be
for
the
windows
were
small
and
high
up
and
were
all
barred
across
with
heavy
iron
bars
and
the
castle
had
no
spires
or
towers
but
was
one
square
black
block
and
looked
more
like
a
prison
than
a
castle
around
it
was
a
high
wall
and
outside
this
a
moat
without
a
bridge
michael
steered
his
boat
to
shore
and
stepped
from
it
and
looked
about
for
some
way
by
which
he
could
cross
the
moat
and
try
for
entrance
to
the
castle
then
he
saw
a
little
hut
near
and
beside
it
lay
an
old
man
apparently
fast
asleep
he
was
small
and
dark
and
his
face
was
gray
and
wrinkled
as
a
monkey
and
he
had
no
hair
on
his
head
close
beside
him
coiled
up
was
a
large
snake
also
asleep
michael
stood
watching
them
both
afraid
to
wake
them
when
without
a
word
the
gray
man
raised
his
head
and
opening
a
pair
of
dull
gray
eyes
fixed
them
on
him
still
he
did
not
speak
and
at
last
the
prince
growing
impatient
went
up
to
him
and
said
friend
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
how
i
am
to
enter
the
castle
or
if
you
have
the
key
to
give
it
to
me
on
this
the
old
man
answered
i
have
the
key
and
no
one
can
enter
without
my
leave
what
will
you
give
me
for
it
why
said
michael
i
have
nothing
but
money
and
he
took
some
coins
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
at
this
the
old
man
laughed
your
money
is
nothing
to
me
he
said
but
look
yonder
over
there
i
am
building
a
wall
of
heavy
stones
and
i
am
old
and
my
strength
fails
me
stay
and
work
for
me
at
that
wall
and
in
return
i
will
give
you
the
key
of
the
castle
but
how
long
must
i
work
said
michael
for
unless
i
can
enter
the
castle
before
seven
years
are
over
it
will
be
no
use
to
me
look
at
that
serpent
said
the
old
man
it
is
sitting
on
its
eggs
when
they
are
hatched
you
shall
have
the
key
and
open
the
castle
door
till
then
you
must
be
my
slave
gladly
said
michael
who
was
delighted
for
no
snake
could
take
seven
years
hatching
its
eggs
then
the
old
man
rose
and
beckoning
to
him
to
follow
went
into
the
little
cottage
from
a
nail
upon
the
wall
he
took
a
pair
of
manacles
fastened
together
by
a
heavy
iron
chain
these
he
slipped
over
michael
wrists
and
stooping
down
over
them
muttered
a
few
words
and
at
once
the
manacles
fastened
together
as
if
they
had
been
locked
and
michael
could
not
move
them
or
draw
out
his
hands
then
the
old
man
took
down
another
heavy
chain
and
passed
it
over
the
first
and
fastened
it
with
more
iron
rings
to
his
ankles
so
that
he
could
only
move
his
arms
and
hands
a
little
way
and
could
not
raise
them
high
and
could
only
walk
with
slow
careful
steps
this
done
he
pointed
to
where
on
the
wall
high
up
hung
a
gleaming
golden
sword
the
handle
of
which
was
set
with
precious
stones
that
said
he
is
the
key
of
the
castle
and
you
need
only
push
the
doors
with
its
point
and
they
will
all
fly
open
but
while
your
hands
are
chained
you
can
not
reach
it
to
lift
it
down
but
when
the
serpent
eggs
are
hatched
your
iron
rings
will
fall
off
and
you
yourself
may
take
the
sword
down
from
its
place
and
push
your
way
into
the
castle
now
get
you
to
your
work
and
work
hard
or
you
may
rue
it
then
he
showed
michael
how
he
was
to
move
the
heavy
stones
and
where
to
build
with
them
and
he
himself
sat
down
by
the
serpent
and
watched
him
while
the
prince
went
to
work
with
a
light
heart
for
he
thought
it
is
hard
work
while
it
lasts
but
not
be
for
long
and
is
not
much
to
do
to
win
my
joan
so
he
worked
hard
till
the
sun
had
set
and
then
the
old
man
rose
saying
enough
and
called
him
into
the
hut
and
gave
him
food
and
drink
but
he
ate
nothing
himself
and
then
he
showed
him
where
he
could
sleep
in
one
corner
and
michael
lay
down
and
slept
soundly
and
dreamed
of
joan
at
break
of
day
he
was
waked
by
the
old
man
who
again
gave
him
plenty
to
eat
and
again
ate
nothing
but
what
he
gave
to
him
he
took
from
an
urn
in
the
corner
and
when
he
had
done
he
put
into
the
urn
the
fragments
that
were
left
all
day
michael
worked
hard
and
in
the
evening
as
he
passed
by
the
snake
he
looked
at
it
as
it
lay
coiled
over
its
eggs
and
said
how
soon
will
your
work
be
done
and
mine
also
good
snake
make
haste
i
pray
that
i
may
find
my
way
into
the
castle
and
return
to
my
princess
so
the
days
passed
each
morning
the
old
man
awoke
michael
and
gave
him
food
and
set
him
to
work
and
all
day
he
laboured
hard
then
when
night
approached
he
called
enough
and
beckoning
him
into
the
hut
gave
him
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
but
never
ate
himself
and
beside
that
one
word
never
spoke
but
crouched
all
day
beside
the
snake
with
closed
eyes
as
if
asleep
meantime
the
doors
of
the
castle
never
opened
and
no
one
was
seen
going
in
or
coming
out
but
sometimes
towards
night
strange
noises
might
be
heard
from
within
its
walls
sometimes
there
were
wails
and
moans
which
it
filled
michael
with
horror
to
hear
and
sometimes
there
was
sweet
singing
so
sweet
that
it
drew
tears
to
his
eyes
but
the
days
passed
and
the
serpent
never
moved
from
its
eggs
and
michael
heart
began
to
be
oppressed
with
fear
lest
the
old
man
was
deceiving
him
and
they
should
never
be
hatched
at
all
as
each
day
passed
he
put
aside
a
stone
on
a
bare
rock
and
one
day
when
he
counted
over
the
stones
to
see
how
many
days
were
gone
he
found
that
more
than
a
year
had
passed
since
his
boat
had
brought
him
to
the
shore
his
hands
had
grown
hard
and
brown
and
cracked
with
working
at
the
heavy
stones
and
his
face
and
neck
were
blistered
and
sunburnt
with
the
fierce
sun
that
beat
upon
them
as
he
worked
his
clothes
were
cut
and
torn
and
soiled
and
yet
he
seemed
to
be
no
nearer
entering
the
castle
then
he
rose
and
went
into
the
cottage
and
looked
longingly
at
the
sword
which
hung
high
up
on
the
walls
and
raised
his
arms
to
try
and
reach
it
but
the
chains
held
him
down
and
as
he
turned
from
it
in
despair
he
saw
the
old
man
standing
in
the
doorway
watching
him
with
his
cold
dull
eyes
what
would
you
do
here
he
asked
have
i
not
bid
you
serve
me
till
the
serpent
eggs
are
hatched
and
then
the
sword
shall
be
yours
and
when
will
the
serpent
eggs
be
hatched
cried
michael
in
despair
that
said
the
old
man
i
can
not
tell
but
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
keep
you
your
part
and
i
will
keep
mine
then
he
turned
again
to
where
the
serpent
lay
and
lying
down
beside
it
closed
his
eyes
and
michael
returned
to
his
work
mournfully
time
passed
but
there
came
no
change
michael
despaired
in
his
heart
but
he
could
not
have
escaped
even
if
he
would
because
of
the
chains
which
hung
from
his
arms
i
will
work
here
he
said
till
the
seven
years
are
out
then
i
will
climb
on
the
wall
which
i
have
built
and
throw
myself
into
the
sea
and
end
my
troubles
sometimes
at
night
he
would
take
from
his
bosom
the
piece
of
magic
glass
which
the
wizard
had
given
him
and
would
gaze
through
it
at
the
star
which
still
looked
a
bright
crimson
colour
why
have
you
led
me
here
cruel
star
he
asked
sadly
if
you
can
not
help
me
more
are
you
shining
over
my
home
and
my
princess
and
does
she
remember
me
the
seven
long
years
will
soon
be
passed
and
they
will
wed
her
to
another
king
and
it
will
be
all
of
no
avail
that
i
have
given
up
everything
to
find
her
heart
since
i
have
only
broken
my
own
so
the
time
passed
michael
worked
hard
by
day
but
by
night
he
lay
and
wept
one
day
when
the
seven
years
had
nearly
worn
themselves
away
he
bent
over
a
pool
of
water
and
in
it
saw
his
own
form
and
he
saw
that
his
hair
was
thin
and
streaked
with
gray
and
his
face
furrowed
and
seamed
and
his
eyes
dim
with
crying
also
his
shoulders
were
bowed
with
hard
work
and
his
clothes
once
so
gorgeous
now
hung
mere
rags
upon
his
bent
form
now
all
is
in
vain
said
he
for
if
even
i
returned
to
my
own
home
no
one
will
know
me
so
changed
am
i
will
go
and
kill
the
snake
that
has
caused
my
misery
and
then
i
will
slay
the
old
man
who
has
deceived
me
so
he
went
up
to
the
snake
who
lay
motionless
coiled
over
its
eggs
as
usual
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
grasp
its
throat
but
as
he
did
so
his
tears
fell
and
dropped
upon
its
head
and
it
writhed
fearfully
and
then
glided
away
so
fast
that
he
could
not
see
where
it
went
and
left
the
heap
of
gray
eggs
bare
beneath
his
hand
the
old
man
lay
beside
them
as
still
as
usual
and
did
not
move
or
open
his
eyes
even
when
the
snake
glided
hissing
past
him
if
the
snake
has
escaped
me
cried
michael
then
at
least
i
can
destroy
the
eggs
and
lifting
his
heel
he
struck
them
with
all
his
might
but
his
foot
left
no
mark
upon
them
nor
even
moved
them
from
their
place
they
might
have
been
made
of
iron
and
each
one
nailed
to
the
ground
so
hard
and
firm
they
stood
michael
burst
out
weeping
afresh
how
foolish
i
am
he
said
yes
and
wicked
too
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
poor
snake
that
its
eggs
are
not
hatched
perhaps
it
is
enchanted
like
me
and
waits
as
patiently
for
them
and
he
bent
his
head
till
his
tears
fell
upon
the
eggs
no
sooner
did
they
touch
them
than
the
shells
broke
and
the
pieces
fell
asunder
and
from
each
egg
came
a
small
moving
thing
though
what
it
was
michael
did
not
see
for
he
leaped
to
his
feet
with
a
shout
of
joy
which
filled
the
air
and
echoed
again
from
the
castle
at
this
the
old
man
opened
his
eyes
and
raising
himself
gazed
as
if
thunderstruck
with
astonishment
at
the
eggs
tis
a
miracle
he
cried
chuckling
with
joy
but
out
of
the
eggs
there
came
no
one
fully
formed
animal
but
from
one
egg
came
a
foot
from
another
a
leg
from
another
a
tail
and
from
one
a
head
and
each
looked
as
though
it
belonged
to
some
different
beast
yet
all
these
drew
themselves
together
and
joined
so
well
that
the
join
was
not
to
be
seen
and
they
made
a
hideous
monster
of
many
colours
then
the
manacles
on
michael
wrists
burst
asunder
and
the
chains
fell
to
the
ground
now
he
cried
i
will
go
and
take
for
myself
the
sword
from
the
wall
and
win
my
way
into
the
castle
and
nothing
shall
hinder
me
more
and
he
turned
and
rushed
into
the
hut
there
upon
the
wall
hung
the
shining
sword
and
michael
reached
out
his
hand
and
seized
it
firmly
and
drew
it
down
from
its
place
i
will
swear
a
vow
he
cried
upon
this
sword
that
when
i
enter
the
castle
i
will
say
not
one
word
for
good
or
for
ill
to
any
one
save
to
ask
for
what
i
come
to
seek
lest
i
should
again
be
kept
for
years
moreover
i
will
not
taste
food
or
drink
till
i
have
found
the
heart
of
my
joan
to
take
back
to
her
then
with
the
sword
in
his
hand
he
passed
the
old
man
who
still
sat
chuckling
over
the
monster
too
busy
to
heed
him
and
he
went
straight
on
to
the
bridgeless
moat
it
was
not
wide
and
he
swam
it
easily
and
scrambled
up
the
bank
by
the
stone
wall
he
pushed
with
the
point
of
the
sword
at
the
gate
and
it
at
once
flew
open
and
he
stood
in
the
outer
court
then
he
saw
a
heavy
door
in
the
wall
of
the
castle
and
went
up
to
it
nothing
fearing
and
on
touching
it
with
the
sword
point
it
too
flew
open
at
once
and
he
entered
he
stepped
into
a
passage
filled
with
flowers
and
hung
with
silken
hangings
he
trod
upon
a
velvet
carpet
and
the
air
was
laden
with
sweet
scents
and
from
afar
he
heard
sweet
voices
singing
he
strode
on
through
another
door
and
yet
another
and
at
each
step
he
took
all
things
became
lovelier
till
at
last
he
passed
into
a
splendid
chamber
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
in
the
ceiling
were
precious
stones
set
in
patterns
of
flowers
and
crowns
on
the
walls
were
soft
velvet
hangings
and
embroideries
the
furniture
was
of
carven
gold
and
silver
and
ivory
and
everywhere
grew
flowers
of
wonderful
beauty
which
sprang
from
the
floor
and
crept
along
the
walls
and
filled
the
air
with
sweet
scents
and
hanging
on
the
walls
were
cages
which
held
what
michael
thought
were
birds
which
sang
most
sweetly
on
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
banquet
all
laid
ready
and
as
michael
looked
at
it
and
wondered
where
he
should
go
farther
a
curtain
was
drawn
aside
and
there
stepped
forth
a
stately
dame
dressed
in
black
velvet
who
came
smiling
towards
him
and
held
out
her
hand
saying
i
am
indeed
glad
to
see
you
i
am
mistress
of
this
castle
and
you
are
very
welcome
but
i
beg
that
before
you
tell
me
from
where
you
come
and
what
you
seek
you
will
sit
down
and
share
this
feast
with
me
michael
was
beginning
to
answer
when
he
felt
the
sword
in
his
hand
and
remembered
his
oath
and
looking
full
in
the
face
of
the
said
i
seek
the
heart
of
princess
joan
and
you
shall
find
it
answered
the
grand
lady
but
first
you
must
rest
and
eat
for
you
must
be
both
tired
and
hungry
and
so
saying
she
sat
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
signed
to
michael
to
sit
at
the
other
and
took
the
golden
covers
from
the
dishes
and
prepared
to
begin
the
feast
michael
knew
not
what
to
do
but
he
sat
at
the
table
in
silence
and
all
at
once
bethought
him
of
the
magic
glass
in
his
bosom
and
drawing
it
forth
when
she
was
not
looking
gazed
through
it
at
her
and
then
he
beheld
no
lady
but
a
wizened
old
woman
robed
in
yellow
with
an
evil
yellow
face
and
evil
yellow
eyes
he
hid
the
glass
again
and
sat
still
as
stone
though
the
yellow
woman
pressed
on
him
the
different
dishes
again
and
again
he
saw
that
her
face
grew
white
with
rage
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
disappeared
and
the
lights
went
out
and
he
was
left
alone
in
the
darkness
he
rose
and
searched
for
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
but
could
not
find
it
nor
any
way
out
of
the
room
so
there
he
was
a
prisoner
alone
with
the
never
mind
quoth
he
to
himself
cheerily
i
have
at
last
reached
the
inside
of
the
castle
and
surely
shall
find
the
heart
of
my
joan
and
if
i
keep
my
vow
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
here
or
say
aught
but
ask
for
that
which
i
seek
nothing
can
harm
me
so
he
sat
down
contentedly
to
wait
for
what
might
come
there
he
sat
the
whole
night
and
no
one
came
near
him
but
the
birds
sang
so
beautifully
that
he
almost
forgot
how
the
time
passed
when
morning
dawned
and
light
again
shone
through
the
windows
he
searched
everywhere
for
some
way
out
of
the
room
but
the
door
had
quite
disappeared
moreover
the
feast
had
gone
from
the
table
the
day
passed
and
still
he
was
all
alone
and
as
evening
again
drew
in
he
sat
and
lamented
quite
wearied
out
and
faint
for
want
of
food
but
when
the
darkness
came
the
lamps
about
the
room
were
suddenly
lit
as
if
by
magic
and
all
was
brilliant
and
a
curtain
was
drawn
aside
and
there
came
in
a
little
child
with
bright
eyes
and
hair
who
held
in
one
hand
a
goblet
and
in
the
other
a
plate
these
she
placed
before
michael
saying
my
mistress
sends
you
these
and
begs
that
you
will
eat
and
drink
for
you
must
be
both
hungry
and
thirsty
but
michael
pushed
away
the
goblet
and
the
plate
and
said
i
seek
the
heart
of
princess
joan
i
beg
you
to
give
it
to
me
to
this
the
seeming
child
answered
nothing
but
still
pressed
on
him
the
food
and
wine
then
michael
took
from
his
bosom
the
magic
glass
and
looked
through
it
and
saw
no
lovely
child
but
the
same
yellow
hag
with
shrivelled
face
and
evil
eyes
with
a
cry
of
rage
she
disappeared
and
though
michael
searched
everywhere
he
could
not
find
the
way
by
which
she
went
now
indeed
he
began
to
feel
that
unless
he
ate
he
could
not
live
much
longer
and
wept
from
very
weakness
still
i
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
he
said
till
i
have
found
what
i
came
to
seek
and
the
fairy
can
not
refuse
me
much
longer
night
passed
and
day
came
and
he
lay
upon
a
couch
quite
still
too
weak
to
move
yet
he
feared
to
sleep
lest
some
spell
should
be
thrown
upon
him
so
he
lay
all
day
and
as
evening
again
drew
near
he
began
to
feel
despair
for
he
knew
that
in
another
day
he
would
be
dead
of
hunger
oh
why
have
i
toiled
for
seven
years
he
cried
aloud
and
at
last
won
my
way
into
the
castle
if
now
i
am
to
be
starved
to
death
and
joan
will
never
know
how
i
have
laboured
for
her
sake
and
why
should
you
be
starved
to
death
my
prince
said
a
voice
and
at
once
the
lights
lit
themselves
and
into
the
room
stepped
the
figure
of
the
princess
joan
just
as
he
had
seen
her
last
dressed
in
white
and
gold
and
in
one
hand
bearing
a
golden
goblet
filled
with
clear
wine
michael
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
held
out
his
arms
to
clasp
her
in
them
but
as
he
did
so
the
sword
sprang
as
it
hung
at
his
side
and
he
remembered
his
vow
and
drew
back
and
gazed
at
her
without
speaking
she
knelt
down
beside
him
and
raised
the
goblet
to
his
lips
saying
softly
my
poor
love
how
long
you
have
worked
for
me
pray
drink
now
that
you
may
be
refreshed
ere
we
two
start
for
our
home
then
as
he
looked
at
her
face
and
saw
how
beautiful
she
was
his
heart
wavered
and
he
thought
can
it
be
my
joan
and
that
i
have
truly
won
her
and
almost
had
he
let
her
place
the
wine
at
his
lips
while
with
one
hand
she
stroked
his
hair
and
murmured
to
him
the
while
in
a
soft
voice
when
the
cup
struck
against
the
magic
glass
in
his
bosom
and
he
drew
it
forth
and
looked
at
her
and
he
trembled
with
horror
and
disgust
for
there
he
saw
no
lovely
princess
joan
but
the
same
yellow
hag
who
held
in
one
skinny
hand
a
goblet
formed
from
a
skull
from
which
she
would
have
him
drink
michael
sprang
to
his
feet
and
dashed
it
from
him
and
the
ruby
wine
poured
on
the
floor
and
there
followed
an
awful
noise
like
a
peal
of
thunder
and
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
and
wild
cries
were
heard
he
grasped
the
sword
and
sat
still
trembling
all
over
but
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
the
whole
aspect
of
the
room
was
changed
the
silken
hangings
and
gold
and
pearls
and
flowers
were
all
gone
and
he
was
sitting
in
a
grim
gray
chamber
like
a
vault
and
in
front
of
him
stood
the
yellow
hag
whose
eyes
shone
spitefully
and
her
lips
laughed
wickedly
but
in
one
hand
she
held
what
it
made
michael
rejoice
to
see
it
was
a
soft
pink
feathery
thing
with
wings
but
shaped
like
a
heart
and
it
trembled
and
quivered
in
her
hand
take
it
she
cried
for
well
have
you
won
it
take
it
and
tell
the
queen
how
many
years
of
toil
and
labour
her
proud
words
and
boasting
have
cost
then
when
you
see
her
from
whom
it
was
stolen
let
it
fly
but
first
say
over
it
these
words
heart
of
joan
lost
and
won
fly
back
home
thy
journey
done
take
back
joy
take
back
pain
heart
of
joan
fly
home
again
and
it
will
fly
to
her
side
and
you
will
see
it
no
more
and
now
begone
michael
seized
the
heart
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
exultation
and
then
turned
and
fled
from
the
room
through
an
open
iron
door
and
passed
through
the
passages
no
longer
softly
carpeted
and
hung
with
silk
but
dreary
and
bare
made
of
cold
stone
down
which
his
echoed
and
clashed
he
hurried
from
the
castle
as
quickly
as
might
be
and
once
outside
did
not
stop
to
look
for
the
old
man
or
the
monster
but
swam
the
moat
and
went
straight
to
where
his
boat
lay
moored
as
he
had
left
it
nearly
seven
years
before
and
never
paused
till
he
had
rowed
so
far
that
the
gray
castle
and
the
shore
had
almost
passed
from
view
at
last
he
came
again
to
the
shore
where
he
had
bought
his
boat
of
the
fishermen
and
here
he
went
on
land
and
started
to
walk
till
he
had
reached
joan
country
and
her
castle
he
had
no
money
and
his
clothes
were
rags
his
hair
was
thin
and
gray
and
his
shoulders
bent
he
looked
like
a
poor
beggar
and
he
had
to
beg
food
as
he
went
or
he
would
have
been
starved
still
he
was
ready
to
cry
for
joy
because
he
took
with
him
the
little
soft
heart
he
had
gone
so
far
to
find
he
trudged
on
both
day
and
night
making
great
haste
for
he
knew
that
the
seven
years
were
almost
gone
and
he
was
afraid
lest
already
he
might
be
too
late
and
find
that
joan
had
married
some
one
else
at
last
after
many
weary
miles
he
reached
her
country
and
drew
near
to
the
palace
where
she
lived
and
here
he
found
that
the
people
were
all
decorating
their
houses
and
making
preparations
as
if
for
some
great
festival
he
stopped
and
begged
for
food
from
a
woman
who
stood
by
a
cottage
door
and
when
she
had
given
him
some
bread
as
he
ate
it
he
asked
her
to
tell
him
what
went
on
in
the
country
and
why
there
was
such
rejoicing
it
is
for
the
marriage
of
the
king
daughter
joan
said
the
woman
she
is
to
be
married
to
old
king
lambert
and
the
wedding
will
be
very
grand
but
none
of
the
country
folk
like
it
for
he
is
old
and
ugly
and
they
say
he
does
not
love
her
at
all
but
only
marries
her
that
he
may
be
king
of
this
country
as
well
as
his
own
the
queen
is
in
sore
distress
about
it
and
for
seven
years
refused
her
consent
but
they
will
be
over
and
so
they
will
be
wed
and
the
guests
are
already
beginning
to
arrive
at
the
palace
and
each
one
brings
some
splendid
gift
i
will
be
a
guest
at
that
wedding
cried
michael
and
i
bring
the
best
gift
of
all
for
the
bride
and
he
hurried
on
again
not
heeding
the
woman
scorn
and
laughter
when
he
came
to
the
palace
he
found
that
it
was
hung
with
flags
and
arches
of
flowers
were
erected
in
front
of
it
and
grand
lords
and
ladies
and
servants
stood
at
the
door
to
receive
the
guests
who
came
michael
went
as
near
as
he
dared
afraid
lest
he
should
be
driven
away
by
the
servants
and
then
he
saw
a
little
and
he
went
to
him
and
said
please
tell
me
where
is
the
princess
joan
and
what
she
is
doing
she
is
sitting
with
the
king
and
queen
and
king
lambert
in
the
to
receive
the
guests
and
accept
the
presents
they
bring
said
the
page
i
am
a
guest
and
i
bring
a
present
for
her
cried
michael
tell
me
how
i
shall
get
into
the
palace
that
i
may
give
it
to
her
on
hearing
this
the
page
burst
out
laughing
and
told
the
other
servants
what
he
said
and
they
were
very
angry
and
seized
michael
and
some
would
have
ducked
him
in
the
pond
and
some
would
have
taken
him
before
the
king
but
they
said
not
now
wait
till
the
wedding
is
over
and
then
we
will
see
how
he
will
punish
the
for
his
impertinence
so
they
took
him
off
to
a
stone
tower
outside
the
garden
gates
and
thrust
him
into
it
and
locked
the
door
and
there
was
only
one
little
window
high
up
and
barred
across
with
bars
and
from
it
he
could
see
the
palace
and
the
gardens
then
at
last
he
gave
way
to
despair
of
what
avail
were
all
my
years
of
toil
and
for
what
am
i
gray
and
old
before
my
time
he
cried
if
after
all
when
i
have
earned
that
for
which
i
worked
so
long
i
may
not
give
it
to
joan
but
must
remain
a
prisoner
and
see
her
pass
by
to
marry
some
one
else
and
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
cried
aloud
at
night
as
he
lay
and
mourned
he
heard
sounds
of
merrymaking
and
music
and
laughter
from
the
castle
sometimes
he
called
out
joan
joan
i
am
here
i
who
have
worked
for
you
for
years
and
brought
home
your
stolen
heart
and
now
will
you
wed
king
lambert
in
spite
of
all
sometimes
he
beat
against
the
bars
of
the
prison
window
but
all
in
vain
and
at
last
when
all
sound
had
ceased
from
the
castle
he
lay
silent
upon
the
ground
caring
no
more
for
life
when
the
sun
rose
and
there
was
again
a
stir
without
he
got
up
and
looked
from
the
window
and
saw
the
old
nurse
who
walked
by
herself
in
the
garden
and
she
looked
very
sad
then
michael
called
out
do
you
not
know
me
you
at
least
who
bid
me
go
and
praised
me
then
should
remember
me
now
on
hearing
this
the
old
nurse
drew
near
the
prison
window
and
looked
at
him
and
said
who
are
you
and
why
are
you
here
my
eyes
are
old
and
my
ears
are
deaf
but
i
think
i
have
seen
you
and
heard
your
voice
before
seven
years
ago
said
michael
i
too
was
a
bridegroom
who
came
to
wed
your
princess
and
for
seven
long
years
have
i
worked
that
i
might
bring
home
to
her
the
heart
she
had
not
go
and
ask
your
queen
why
she
has
broken
her
pledge
to
wait
for
seven
years
till
prince
michael
should
return
prince
michael
is
it
really
prince
michael
cried
the
old
nurse
joyfully
and
you
come
in
time
for
our
princess
is
not
married
yet
and
she
must
pass
by
here
on
her
way
to
church
so
you
shall
call
to
her
as
she
passes
by
and
speak
for
yourself
then
keep
near
and
tell
me
when
she
comes
said
michael
lest
she
go
by
without
seeing
me
presently
the
whole
castle
was
astir
and
trumpets
were
sounding
and
clarions
ringing
then
when
the
sun
was
high
michael
heard
the
tramping
of
horses
and
the
sound
of
music
and
the
old
nurse
said
to
him
here
she
is
and
he
looked
between
the
bars
of
the
prison
window
and
saw
a
grand
procession
and
his
heart
gave
a
bound
for
in
their
midst
in
a
golden
gown
and
seated
on
a
white
palfrey
was
princess
joan
and
she
looked
just
as
lovely
as
when
he
went
away
seven
years
before
on
one
side
of
her
rode
her
father
and
mother
and
the
queen
face
was
most
mournful
and
her
eyes
were
red
with
crying
on
the
other
rode
an
ugly
old
man
whom
michael
guessed
to
be
king
lambert
and
he
smiled
and
bowed
to
the
people
but
they
muttered
and
grumbled
when
they
looked
at
him
and
saw
how
ugly
and
wicked
he
looked
when
michael
saw
them
coming
he
took
from
his
bosom
the
little
pink
heart
and
stroked
it
fondly
as
he
whispered
over
it
heart
of
joan
lost
and
won
fly
back
home
thy
journey
done
take
back
joy
take
back
pain
heart
of
joan
fly
home
again
and
at
once
it
spread
its
wings
and
fluttered
through
the
bars
of
the
prison
and
over
the
heads
of
the
people
who
shouted
look
at
the
pink
bird
for
a
moment
it
rested
at
the
side
of
the
princess
joan
and
then
disappeared
she
gave
a
scream
and
cried
my
mother
my
father
what
has
happened
oh
see
it
is
michael
who
has
returned
and
ere
they
could
stop
her
she
had
turned
her
palfrey
head
towards
the
prison
window
and
pushed
her
white
arms
through
the
bars
to
clasp
the
prince
illustration
and
ere
they
could
stop
her
she
had
turned
her
head
towards
the
prison
window
and
pushed
her
white
arms
through
the
bars
to
clasp
the
p
michael
my
love
she
cried
how
gray
and
worn
you
are
now
how
hard
you
must
have
laboured
for
me
through
these
long
years
now
how
shall
i
pay
you
save
by
loving
you
all
my
life
and
she
tried
to
beat
down
the
bars
of
the
prison
window
when
the
people
heard
her
they
cried
it
is
prince
michael
who
went
seven
years
ago
and
who
we
all
thought
was
dead
and
he
is
returned
in
time
to
marry
our
princess
now
will
we
indeed
have
a
wedding
and
she
shall
marry
the
prince
who
has
toiled
so
long
for
her
and
king
and
queen
and
people
laughed
for
joy
was
in
vain
for
king
lambert
to
rage
and
cry
that
the
princess
was
betrothed
to
him
nay
said
the
queen
she
has
been
pledged
to
prince
michael
for
seven
years
we
are
grieved
for
your
sake
king
lambert
but
we
can
not
break
our
royal
word
then
the
people
burst
into
the
prison
and
brought
out
michael
all
torn
and
gray
as
he
was
and
princess
joan
kissed
him
before
them
all
and
begged
that
he
would
marry
her
at
once
that
every
one
might
see
how
well
she
loved
him
and
how
grateful
she
was
so
they
brought
a
fine
white
horse
with
a
grand
gold
saddle
and
jewelled
bridle
and
placed
michael
upon
it
and
he
rode
to
church
beside
the
princess
and
married
her
and
the
people
threw
flowers
before
them
and
bells
rang
and
trumpets
sounded
and
all
were
glad
and
when
it
was
done
michael
was
dressed
in
purple
and
gold
and
messengers
were
sent
to
his
father
and
mother
and
the
old
wizard
that
they
might
come
and
see
how
he
had
come
home
victorious
and
rejoicings
filled
the
whole
country
for
now
we
are
sure
of
a
good
king
the
people
said
see
he
has
already
shown
what
he
can
do
surely
no
one
else
could
ever
have
found
the
heart
of
princess
joan

friend
said
he
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
carrying
my
load
for
me
for
a
p
the
pedlar
pack
illustration
a
pedlar
was
toiling
along
a
dusty
road
carrying
his
pack
on
his
back
when
he
saw
a
donkey
grazing
by
the
wayside
friend
said
he
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
carrying
my
load
for
me
for
a
little
if
i
do
so
what
will
you
give
me
said
the
donkey
i
will
give
you
two
pieces
of
gold
said
the
pedlar
but
he
did
not
speak
the
truth
for
he
knew
he
had
no
gold
to
give
agreed
said
the
donkey
so
they
journeyed
on
together
in
a
very
friendly
manner
the
donkey
carrying
the
pedlar
pack
and
the
pedlar
walking
by
his
side
after
a
time
they
met
a
raven
who
was
looking
for
worms
in
the
roadside
and
the
donkey
called
out
to
him
black
friend
if
you
are
going
our
way
you
would
do
well
to
sit
upon
my
back
and
drive
away
the
flies
which
worry
me
sadly
and
what
will
you
pay
me
to
do
this
asked
the
raven
money
is
no
object
to
me
said
the
donkey
so
i
will
give
you
three
pieces
of
gold
and
he
too
knew
he
was
making
a
false
promise
for
he
had
no
gold
at
all
to
give
agreed
said
the
raven
so
they
went
on
in
high
good
humour
the
donkey
carrying
the
pedlar
wares
and
the
raven
sitting
on
the
donkey
back
driving
away
the
flies
after
a
time
they
met
a
and
the
raven
called
out
to
it
little
cousin
do
you
want
to
earn
a
little
money
if
so
bring
me
some
worms
from
the
bank
as
we
go
along
for
i
had
no
breakfast
and
am
very
hungry
what
will
you
give
me
for
it
asked
the
let
us
say
four
pieces
of
gold
said
the
raven
grandly
for
i
have
saved
more
during
my
long
life
than
i
know
how
to
spend
but
he
knew
this
was
not
true
for
he
had
not
saved
any
gold
at
all
very
well
said
the
and
so
on
they
went
the
donkey
carrying
the
pedlar
pack
and
the
raven
keeping
the
flies
away
from
the
donkey
and
the
bringing
worms
to
the
raven
presently
they
saw
in
the
distance
a
town
and
the
pedlar
took
out
from
his
pack
some
shawls
and
stuffs
and
hung
them
over
the
back
that
the
might
see
and
buy
if
they
were
so
disposed
on
the
top
of
the
other
goods
lay
a
small
scarlet
blanket
and
when
he
saw
it
the
said
to
the
pedlar
what
will
you
take
for
that
little
blanket
it
seems
to
be
a
good
one
name
your
price
and
you
shall
have
it
whatever
it
is
for
i
am
badly
in
want
of
a
blanket
just
now
but
as
the
had
not
a
penny
in
the
world
he
knew
he
could
not
pay
for
it
the
price
of
the
blanket
is
five
pieces
of
gold
said
the
pedlar
that
seems
to
me
to
be
very
dear
said
the
i
do
mind
giving
you
four
pieces
of
gold
for
it
but
five
is
too
much
agreed
said
the
pedlar
and
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
thought
now
i
shall
be
able
to
pay
the
donkey
otherwise
i
might
have
had
some
trouble
in
getting
rid
of
him
the
flew
to
the
raven
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
please
to
pay
me
the
four
pieces
of
gold
you
owe
me
for
we
are
coming
to
a
town
and
i
must
be
turning
back
four
pieces
of
gold
is
really
too
much
for
bringing
a
few
worms
said
the
raven
it
is
absurd
to
expect
such
payment
but
i
will
give
you
three
and
you
shall
have
them
almost
immediately
and
he
bent
down
over
the
ear
and
whispered
my
friend
it
is
time
you
paid
me
the
three
pieces
of
gold
which
you
promised
for
the
pedlar
will
stop
at
this
town
and
you
will
not
have
to
go
farther
with
him
on
thinking
it
over
said
the
donkey
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
three
pieces
of
gold
are
really
a
great
deal
too
much
to
give
for
having
a
few
flies
driven
away
you
must
have
known
that
i
was
only
joking
when
i
said
it
but
i
will
let
you
have
two
though
i
consider
that
it
is
much
more
than
the
job
was
worth
and
the
donkey
turned
again
to
the
pedlar
saying
now
good
sir
your
two
pieces
of
gold
if
you
please
in
a
moment
said
the
pedlar
and
turning
to
the
said
i
really
must
have
the
money
for
the
blanket
at
once
so
you
shall
answered
the
and
cried
angrily
to
the
raven
i
want
my
money
now
and
can
not
wait
in
an
instant
answered
the
raven
and
again
whispered
to
the
donkey
why
ca
you
pay
me
honestly
i
should
be
ashamed
of
trying
to
slip
out
of
my
debts
in
such
a
way
i
wo
keep
you
waiting
a
second
said
the
donkey
and
he
turned
once
more
to
the
pedlar
and
cried
come
give
me
my
money
for
shame
a
man
like
you
trying
to
cheat
a
poor
beast
like
me
then
the
pedlar
said
to
the
pay
me
for
my
blanket
or
wring
your
neck
and
the
cried
to
the
raven
give
me
my
money
or
i
peck
out
your
eyes
and
the
raven
croaked
to
the
donkey
if
you
do
pay
me
i
bite
off
your
tail
and
the
donkey
again
cried
to
the
pedlar
you
dishonest
wretch
pay
me
my
money
or
i
kick
you
soundly
and
they
made
such
an
uproar
outside
the
walls
of
the
town
that
the
beadle
came
out
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
each
turned
to
him
and
began
to
complain
of
the
other
loudly
you
are
a
set
of
rogues
and
vagabonds
said
the
beadle
and
you
shall
all
come
before
the
mayor
and
he
settle
your
quarrels
pretty
quickly
and
treat
you
as
you
deserve
at
this
they
all
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
away
each
one
saying
he
did
not
care
about
being
paid
at
all
but
the
beadle
would
not
listen
to
them
and
led
them
straight
away
to
the
where
the
mayor
sat
judging
the
people
now
whom
have
we
here
cried
he
a
pedlar
a
donkey
a
raven
and
a
a
set
of
worthless
vagabonds
i
be
bound
let
us
hear
what
they
have
to
say
for
themselves
on
this
the
pedlar
began
to
complain
of
the
and
the
of
the
raven
and
the
raven
of
the
donkey
and
the
donkey
of
the
pedlar
the
mayor
did
not
heed
them
much
but
he
eyed
the
pedlar
pack
and
at
length
interrupted
them
and
said
i
am
convinced
that
you
are
a
set
of
fellows
and
one
is
quite
as
bad
as
the
other
so
i
order
that
the
pedlar
be
locked
up
in
the
prison
that
the
donkey
be
soundly
well
thrashed
and
that
the
raven
and
the
both
have
their
pulled
out
and
then
be
turned
out
of
the
town
as
for
the
blanket
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
only
good
thing
in
the
whole
matter
and
as
i
can
not
allow
you
to
keep
the
cause
of
such
a
disturbance
i
will
take
it
for
myself
beadle
lead
the
prisoners
away
so
the
beadle
did
as
he
was
told
and
the
pedlar
was
locked
up
for
many
days
in
the
prison
it
is
very
sad
to
think
to
what
straits
an
honest
man
may
be
brought
he
sighed
to
himself
as
he
sat
lamenting
his
hard
fate
in
future
this
will
be
a
warning
to
me
to
keep
clear
of
if
the
had
paid
me
as
he
ought
i
should
not
be
here
now
meantime
the
donkey
was
being
soundly
well
thrashed
and
after
each
blow
he
cried
alas
alas
see
what
comes
to
an
innocent
quadruped
for
having
to
do
with
human
beings
had
the
pedlar
given
me
the
money
he
owed
i
should
not
now
be
beaten
thus
in
future
i
will
never
make
a
bargain
with
men
the
raven
and
the
hopped
out
of
the
town
by
different
roads
and
both
were
very
sad
for
they
had
lost
all
their
tail
feathers
which
the
beadle
had
pulled
out
alas
croaked
the
raven
my
fate
is
indeed
a
hard
one
but
it
serves
me
right
for
trusting
a
donkey
who
goes
on
his
feet
and
can
not
fly
it
is
truly
a
warning
to
me
never
again
to
trust
anything
without
a
beak
the
was
quite
crestfallen
and
could
scarcely
keep
from
tears
it
all
comes
of
my
being
so
taken
in
by
that
raven
he
sighed
but
i
should
have
known
that
these
large
birds
are
never
honest
in
future
i
will
be
wise
and
never
make
a
bargain
with
anything
bigger
or
stronger
than
myself
illustration
the
bread
of
discontent
illustration
once
there
was
a
baker
who
had
a
very
bad
violent
temper
and
whenever
a
batch
of
bread
was
spoiled
he
flew
into
such
a
rage
that
his
wife
and
daughters
dared
not
go
near
him
one
day
it
happened
that
all
his
bread
was
burnt
and
on
this
he
stamped
and
raved
with
anger
he
threw
the
loaves
all
about
the
floor
when
one
burnt
blacker
than
the
rest
broke
in
half
and
out
of
it
crept
a
tiny
thin
black
man
no
thicker
than
an
eel
with
long
arms
and
legs
what
are
you
making
all
this
fuss
about
master
baker
said
he
if
you
will
give
me
a
home
in
your
oven
i
will
see
to
the
baking
of
your
bread
and
will
answer
for
it
that
you
shall
never
have
so
much
as
a
loaf
spoiled
illustration
if
you
will
give
me
a
home
in
your
oven
i
will
see
to
the
baking
of
your
bread
and
will
answer
for
it
that
you
shall
never
have
so
much
as
a
loaf
p
and
pray
what
sort
of
bread
would
it
be
if
you
were
in
the
oven
and
helped
to
bake
it
said
the
baker
i
think
my
customers
might
not
like
to
eat
it
on
the
contrary
said
the
imp
they
would
like
it
exceedingly
it
is
true
that
it
would
make
them
rather
unhappy
but
that
will
not
hurt
you
as
you
need
not
eat
it
yourself
why
should
it
make
them
unhappy
said
the
baker
if
it
is
good
bread
it
wo
do
any
one
harm
and
if
it
is
bad
they
wo
buy
it
it
will
taste
very
good
replied
the
imp
but
it
will
make
all
who
eat
it
discontented
and
they
will
think
themselves
very
unfortunate
whether
they
are
so
or
no
but
this
will
not
do
you
any
harm
and
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
sell
as
much
as
you
wish
agreed
said
the
baker
so
the
little
imp
crept
into
the
oven
and
curled
himself
into
the
darkness
behind
and
the
baker
saw
no
more
of
him
but
next
day
he
made
a
great
batch
of
bread
and
though
he
took
no
heed
of
the
time
when
he
put
it
in
and
drew
it
out
just
as
he
wanted
it
it
was
done
quite
right
neither
too
dark
nor
too
light
and
the
baker
was
in
high
good
humour
the
first
person
who
tasted
the
bread
was
the
chief
justice
he
came
down
to
breakfast
in
high
spirits
for
he
had
just
heard
that
an
old
aunt
was
dead
and
had
left
him
a
great
deal
of
money
so
he
kissed
his
wife
and
chucked
his
daughters
under
the
chin
and
told
them
that
he
had
good
news
for
them
his
old
aunt
had
left
him
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
her
will
on
this
his
wife
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
and
his
daughters
ran
to
him
and
kissed
him
and
begged
him
to
let
them
have
some
of
it
so
they
all
sat
down
to
breakfast
in
great
glee
but
no
sooner
had
the
justice
tasted
the
bread
than
his
face
fell
this
is
excellent
bread
he
said
taking
a
large
slice
i
wish
everything
else
were
as
good
and
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
why
cried
his
wife
who
had
not
yet
begun
to
eat
this
morning
i
am
sure
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
complain
of
nay
said
the
mayor
it
is
very
nice
to
have
twenty
thousand
pounds
but
think
how
much
nicer
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
thirty
how
much
more
one
could
have
done
with
that
or
even
if
it
had
been
thousand
pounds
or
even
thousand
pounds
is
a
very
nice
sum
of
money
but
twenty
thousand
pounds
is
no
good
at
all
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
not
be
better
not
to
have
had
any
nonsense
cried
his
wife
who
was
now
eating
her
breakfast
also
you
are
very
wicked
to
be
so
discontented
but
one
thing
i
do
say
it
would
have
been
much
nicer
if
we
had
had
it
when
we
were
young
and
better
able
to
enjoy
it
money
is
very
little
use
to
people
at
our
time
of
life
it
would
have
been
really
nice
if
we
had
had
it
fifteen
years
ago
as
it
is
i
say
i
care
much
for
it
and
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
we
did
not
get
it
before
nay
cried
the
daughters
in
that
case
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
for
us
to
have
it
instead
of
you
we
are
young
and
able
to
enjoy
ourselves
and
we
could
have
given
you
a
little
of
it
if
you
liked
but
we
could
have
been
very
happy
with
the
rest
as
it
is
it
is
no
pleasure
to
us
so
they
fell
to
quarrelling
about
the
money
and
by
the
time
breakfast
was
done
they
all
had
tears
in
their
eyes
and
felt
discontented
and
unhappy
the
next
person
to
eat
the
bread
was
the
village
doctor
all
night
long
he
had
been
sitting
up
with
a
man
who
had
broken
his
leg
and
he
had
feared
lest
he
should
die
but
as
morning
came
he
saw
he
would
live
so
he
returned
home
to
his
wife
in
very
good
spirits
although
he
was
sadly
tired
the
wife
had
already
had
her
breakfast
but
she
had
made
all
ready
for
her
husband
with
a
loaf
of
the
baker
new
bread
see
dear
husband
she
said
here
is
your
breakfast
and
some
nice
bread
quite
new
because
i
know
you
like
it
how
glad
we
ought
to
be
that
this
poor
man
is
likely
to
live
yes
indeed
said
the
doctor
being
up
all
night
is
tiring
work
but
i
do
grudge
it
when
i
know
that
it
does
some
good
and
then
he
began
to
eat
i
am
not
sure
after
all
that
i
have
done
such
a
good
thing
in
curing
this
man
it
is
true
that
his
broken
leg
hurt
him
very
much
but
perhaps
when
he
is
well
again
he
may
break
his
back
and
that
would
be
much
worse
perhaps
i
had
better
have
left
him
to
die
i
daresay
when
he
is
quite
well
all
kinds
of
misfortunes
will
befall
him
i
had
much
better
have
let
him
alone
why
cried
his
wife
in
surprise
what
are
you
saying
husband
are
you
not
a
doctor
and
is
it
not
your
business
to
cure
people
and
when
you
succeed
ought
you
not
to
be
glad
i
wish
i
were
not
a
doctor
said
the
husband
sighing
it
would
be
much
better
if
there
were
no
doctors
at
all
and
he
sat
and
lamented
and
nothing
his
wife
could
say
could
cheer
him
in
a
pretty
little
cottage
near
the
doctor
house
lived
a
young
couple
who
were
newly
married
and
were
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
their
cottage
was
covered
with
roses
and
filled
with
pretty
things
and
they
had
everything
their
hearts
could
desire
this
morning
they
both
came
down
smiling
and
happy
and
the
young
wife
kissed
her
husband
and
sang
for
joy
so
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
chattering
like
two
birds
in
a
nest
but
no
sooner
had
the
husband
tasted
the
bread
than
his
face
fell
and
he
was
silent
for
a
time
then
he
said
it
is
a
very
terrible
thing
to
think
how
happy
we
are
for
it
can
not
last
something
melancholy
is
sure
to
happen
to
us
and
till
it
comes
we
shall
live
in
dread
of
it
for
we
know
happiness
never
lasts
and
this
is
a
thought
that
makes
me
very
sad
the
wife
had
now
also
taken
some
bread
what
is
this
you
are
saying
she
said
how
can
you
think
such
dreadful
things
i
do
not
like
you
when
you
talk
like
that
and
i
think
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to
be
married
to
a
man
who
wants
to
be
unhappy
the
best
thing
we
can
hope
for
said
the
husband
sighing
is
for
some
great
misfortune
to
befall
us
then
we
should
be
all
right
for
we
should
know
then
that
we
knew
the
worst
that
could
come
as
it
is
we
shall
live
in
suspense
all
our
days
now
cried
his
wife
i
am
indeed
unfortunate
what
could
be
worse
than
to
have
a
husband
who
does
not
like
being
happy
i
wish
i
had
married
some
one
else
or
indeed
had
no
husband
at
all
so
both
began
to
grumble
and
at
last
to
quarrel
and
finally
both
were
crying
with
anger
not
far
out
of
the
village
was
a
large
pleasant
farmhouse
standing
amongst
fields
and
the
farmer
was
a
hale
bright
man
with
a
good
wife
and
pretty
children
he
was
very
busy
just
now
getting
in
the
corn
for
it
was
autumn
and
he
stood
among
his
men
directing
them
as
they
worked
in
the
fields
he
had
not
had
time
to
have
a
proper
breakfast
before
going
to
work
but
his
wife
sent
some
out
to
him
with
some
of
the
baker
new
bread
and
he
sat
down
under
a
tree
to
eat
it
as
he
did
so
he
looked
up
at
the
farmhouse
and
thought
with
pride
that
it
was
the
largest
farm
in
all
the
country
round
and
that
it
had
belonged
to
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
his
before
him
is
a
fine
old
house
for
sure
thought
he
as
he
took
a
large
piece
of
bread
is
so
well
built
and
strong
but
no
sooner
had
he
swallowed
a
mouthful
than
his
thoughts
changed
what
should
i
do
if
it
were
to
fall
down
and
crush
me
some
day
he
said
to
himself
after
all
is
only
built
of
brick
and
might
tumble
any
day
how
much
stronger
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
built
of
stone
then
it
would
not
have
been
nearly
so
likely
to
give
way
really
when
my
built
it
he
should
have
thought
of
this
how
selfish
all
men
are
and
he
became
quite
unhappy
lest
his
house
should
fall
and
lamented
while
he
ate
in
the
kitchen
the
farmer
wife
was
very
busy
cooking
and
cleaning
and
scarcely
stopped
to
eat
till
near
then
she
took
up
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
and
leant
against
the
window
as
she
ate
it
that
she
might
watch
for
her
eldest
girl
and
boy
janey
and
jimmy
who
would
now
be
returning
from
school
our
baker
really
bakes
very
decent
bread
said
she
is
almost
as
good
as
my
own
and
she
went
on
eating
till
she
saw
her
two
children
coming
through
the
fields
together
here
they
come
said
she
how
bonny
they
look
really
i
ought
to
be
very
proud
of
them
i
do
know
which
is
the
prettier
janey
or
jimmy
but
is
a
pity
for
sure
that
janey
is
the
eldest
it
would
be
much
better
if
jimmy
were
older
than
she
is
a
bad
thing
for
the
sister
to
be
older
than
the
brother
now
if
he
were
her
age
and
she
were
his
that
would
be
really
nice
for
then
he
could
take
care
of
her
and
see
after
her
but
as
it
is
she
will
try
to
direct
him
and
boys
never
like
to
obey
their
sisters
i
really
almost
think
i
had
better
not
have
had
any
children
at
all
and
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
when
her
girl
and
boy
ran
in
to
her
her
face
was
very
sad
and
she
seemed
to
be
scarcely
glad
to
see
them
so
things
went
on
all
over
the
village
each
one
as
he
tasted
the
bread
grew
discontented
and
angry
till
at
last
all
the
people
went
about
grumbling
and
complaining
or
else
shedding
tears
outright
only
the
baker
himself
was
cheerful
and
merry
and
sang
as
he
kneaded
his
dough
and
sold
it
to
his
customers
with
a
light
heart
for
his
trade
had
never
been
so
good
every
atom
of
bread
he
made
was
sold
at
once
so
he
cared
not
one
whit
for
the
trouble
of
the
other
people
and
laughed
to
himself
when
he
heard
them
complaining
and
thought
of
the
words
of
the
dark
little
elf
one
day
as
he
stood
kneading
at
the
door
and
whistling
to
himself
the
doctor
walked
past
and
looked
angrily
at
him
what
on
earth
are
you
making
that
whistling
for
he
asked
i
declare
one
would
think
that
you
were
as
happy
as
a
man
could
be
and
so
i
am
said
the
baker
and
so
i
should
think
were
you
too
for
you
have
nothing
to
trouble
you
nothing
to
trouble
me
forsooth
cried
the
doctor
in
a
rage
how
dare
you
insult
me
in
this
way
i
tell
you
what
it
is
my
fine
fellow
i
think
you
are
very
impertinent
and
if
i
have
any
more
of
your
impudence
i
will
take
my
stick
and
thrash
you
soundly
it
really
is
not
to
be
borne
that
one
man
should
be
allowed
to
tell
another
that
he
has
nothing
to
complain
of
nay
can
have
as
much
to
complain
of
as
you
like
so
long
as
i
have
not
cried
the
baker
and
he
laughed
loudly
this
only
made
the
doctor
angrier
still
and
he
was
just
going
to
seize
the
baker
when
up
came
the
farmer
was
there
ever
such
a
village
as
this
he
cried
it
is
not
fit
for
any
one
to
live
in
there
is
always
such
fighting
and
quarrelling
going
on
what
is
the
matter
here
matter
enough
cried
the
doctor
here
is
a
fellow
dares
to
tell
me
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
nor
he
either
this
is
monstrous
said
the
farmer
he
deserves
to
be
hung
how
dares
he
say
such
a
thing
on
such
a
wretched
day
as
this
with
such
a
blue
sky
and
such
a
bright
sun
why
master
farmer
cried
the
baker
yesterday
you
grumbled
because
it
was
raining
and
now
you
grumble
because
it
is
fine
and
i
tell
you
that
it
is
enough
to
make
one
grumble
said
the
farmer
it
should
have
been
fair
yesterday
and
should
have
rained
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
such
talk
master
baker
and
i
think
it
would
serve
you
justly
right
if
we
took
you
before
the
justice
and
let
us
see
what
he
thinks
of
your
conduct
nay
cried
the
baker
beginning
to
be
frightened
what
have
i
done
that
i
am
to
be
taken
before
the
justice
what
have
you
done
indeed
said
the
doctor
we
will
see
if
the
justice
can
not
find
that
out
pretty
quickly
so
they
seized
the
baker
and
dragged
him
away
in
spite
of
himself
and
as
they
pulled
him
through
the
village
the
people
thronged
about
them
and
followed
till
there
was
quite
a
large
crowd
the
justice
sat
at
his
door
smoking
a
pipe
with
tears
in
his
eyes
now
what
is
all
this
uproar
for
cried
he
am
i
never
to
be
left
in
peace
how
hard
is
the
life
of
a
justice
but
he
got
up
and
came
out
on
the
steps
to
meet
them
see
here
cried
the
doctor
here
is
a
man
who
says
he
has
nothing
to
complain
of
and
we
have
brought
him
to
you
to
know
if
he
is
to
be
punished
or
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
talking
like
this
certainly
not
cried
the
justice
or
we
shall
soon
have
the
whole
village
in
an
uproar
let
him
be
taken
to
the
and
i
will
order
that
he
be
publicly
flogged
by
the
soldiers
at
this
the
poor
baker
burst
out
crying
and
entreated
to
be
let
off
saying
that
now
indeed
he
had
plenty
to
complain
of
but
at
this
the
justice
was
angrier
still
then
said
he
you
certainly
deserve
to
be
flogged
for
having
told
an
untruth
before
when
you
said
you
had
not
take
him
away
and
do
as
i
bid
so
they
dragged
the
baker
off
to
the
and
made
a
ring
round
him
so
that
he
could
not
escape
and
then
there
came
down
two
or
three
soldiers
with
ropes
in
their
hands
and
they
seized
him
and
began
to
beat
him
before
all
the
crowd
but
by
this
time
all
the
people
were
so
enraged
against
him
that
a
number
of
them
cried
let
us
go
to
his
house
and
pull
it
down
so
off
they
ran
to
the
baker
house
and
broke
the
windows
and
knocked
about
the
furniture
and
then
some
of
them
fell
on
the
oven
and
wrenched
off
the
door
and
others
seized
the
pokers
and
tongs
and
smashed
in
its
sides
and
in
the
hurry
and
scuffle
the
little
dark
man
crept
out
of
the
oven
and
scuttled
away
unseen
by
any
one
but
no
sooner
had
he
gone
than
a
great
change
came
across
the
people
the
soldiers
on
the
green
stopped
beating
the
baker
and
looked
at
each
other
aghast
and
the
justice
called
out
stop
what
is
all
this
uproar
about
and
what
has
this
man
done
that
you
are
beating
him
without
my
orders
and
the
people
in
the
crowd
whispered
to
each
other
it
is
true
what
has
he
done
and
they
slunk
away
looking
ashamed
the
justice
also
at
first
looked
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
but
he
drew
himself
up
and
looking
very
important
said
there
my
man
you
are
forgiven
for
this
once
and
now
go
your
way
and
see
that
you
behave
better
in
future
and
then
he
walked
away
with
much
dignity
so
the
baker
was
left
alone
in
the
and
he
cried
for
rage
and
pain
this
all
comes
of
the
oven
imp
cried
he
as
he
limped
home
directly
i
get
home
i
will
drive
him
out
of
my
oven
and
away
from
my
house
better
to
have
a
hundred
batches
of
bread
spoiled
than
to
be
flogged
for
saying
one
is
happy
but
when
he
reached
his
house
the
little
dark
man
was
nowhere
to
be
found
there
was
nought
but
the
broken
oven
with
its
sides
battered
in
the
baker
mended
the
oven
and
from
that
time
forth
his
bread
was
just
like
other
people
but
for
all
that
he
had
learnt
to
be
quite
contented
for
now
he
knew
that
there
were
worse
things
than
having
his
loaves
burnt
black
and
he
was
only
too
well
pleased
to
take
his
chance
with
other
people
without
the
help
of
fairy
folk
as
for
the
little
black
imp
he
was
never
heard
of
more
and
the
people
in
the
village
soon
recovered
their
good
humour
and
were
just
as
happy
and
contented
as
they
had
been
before
they
tasted
the
bread
of
discontent

ye
three
clever
kings
illustration
old
king
roland
lay
upon
his
and
as
he
had
no
son
to
reign
after
him
he
sent
for
his
three
nephews
aldovrand
aldebert
and
alderete
and
addressed
them
as
follows
my
dear
nephews
i
feel
that
my
days
are
now
drawing
to
an
end
and
one
of
you
will
have
to
be
king
when
i
am
dead
but
there
is
no
pleasure
in
being
king
my
people
have
been
difficult
to
govern
and
never
content
with
what
i
did
for
them
so
that
my
life
has
been
a
hard
one
and
though
i
have
watched
you
all
closely
still
i
know
not
which
is
most
fit
to
wear
the
crown
so
my
wish
is
that
you
should
each
try
it
in
turn
you
aldovrand
as
you
are
the
oldest
shall
be
king
first
and
if
you
reign
happily
all
well
and
good
but
if
you
fail
let
aldebert
take
your
place
and
if
he
fail
let
him
give
it
up
to
alderete
and
then
you
will
know
which
is
the
best
fitted
to
govern
on
this
the
three
young
men
all
thanked
their
uncle
and
each
one
declared
that
he
would
do
his
best
and
soon
after
old
king
roland
died
and
was
buried
with
great
state
and
ceremony
so
now
aldovrand
was
to
be
king
and
he
was
crowned
and
there
were
great
rejoicings
everywhere
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
king
cried
he
in
much
glee
now
i
can
amuse
myself
and
do
just
as
i
please
and
there
will
be
no
one
to
stop
me
and
i
will
lie
in
bed
as
late
as
i
like
in
the
morning
for
who
dares
blame
one
if
one
is
king
next
morning
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
came
to
the
palace
to
see
the
new
king
and
settle
affairs
of
state
but
they
were
told
that
his
majesty
was
in
bed
and
had
given
orders
that
no
one
should
disturb
him
this
is
a
bad
beginning
sighed
the
prime
minister
very
bad
echoed
the
chancellor
when
they
came
back
to
the
palace
later
in
the
day
the
king
was
playing
at
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
some
of
his
gentlemen
and
was
very
angry
at
being
interrupted
in
his
game
a
pretty
thing
he
cried
that
i
the
king
am
to
be
sent
for
hither
and
thither
as
if
i
were
a
lacquey
they
must
go
away
and
come
another
time
and
on
hearing
this
the
prime
minister
and
chancellor
looked
graver
still
but
next
morning
there
came
the
and
the
lord
high
admiral
as
well
as
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
all
wanting
to
have
an
audience
with
the
king
and
as
he
was
not
out
of
bed
and
they
could
not
wait
any
longer
they
all
stood
outside
his
bedroom
door
and
knocked
to
gain
admittance
and
at
last
he
came
out
in
a
towering
rage
and
throwing
them
his
crown
cried
here
let
one
of
my
cousins
be
king
for
i
will
not
bear
this
longer
it
is
much
more
trouble
than
it
is
worth
so
aldebert
or
alderete
may
try
it
and
see
how
they
like
it
but
as
for
me
i
have
had
enough
of
it
and
he
ran
downstairs
and
out
of
the
palace
door
leaving
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
and
the
general
and
admiral
staring
at
each
other
in
dismay
aldovrand
walked
out
of
the
town
unnoticed
and
turned
towards
the
country
whistling
cheerily
to
himself
when
he
had
gone
some
way
in
the
fields
he
came
to
a
farmhouse
and
in
a
meadow
near
the
farmer
stood
talking
to
his
men
aldovrand
went
straight
up
to
him
and
touching
his
hat
asked
if
he
could
give
him
any
work
work
cried
the
farmer
little
thinking
he
was
talking
to
his
late
king
why
what
sort
of
work
can
you
do
well
said
aldovrand
i
am
not
very
fond
of
running
about
but
if
you
want
any
one
to
mind
your
sheep
or
keep
the
birds
from
your
corn
i
could
do
that
nicely
i
tell
you
what
you
can
do
if
you
like
said
the
farmer
i
am
wanting
a
to
take
care
of
my
geese
see
there
they
are
on
the
common
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
to
see
that
they
do
stray
away
and
to
drive
them
in
at
night
that
will
suit
me
exactly
cried
aldovrand
i
will
begin
at
once
and
he
went
straight
on
to
the
common
and
when
he
had
collected
the
geese
together
lay
down
to
watch
them
in
high
good
humour
this
is
capital
he
cried
and
much
better
than
being
king
at
the
palace
here
there
is
no
prime
minister
or
chancellor
to
come
worrying
and
he
lay
watching
the
geese
all
day
very
contentedly
when
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
knew
that
aldovrand
was
really
gone
they
went
in
a
great
hurry
to
aldebert
to
tell
him
that
it
was
his
turn
to
be
king
but
when
he
heard
how
his
cousin
had
run
away
he
looked
frightened
i
will
do
my
best
quoth
he
but
i
really
know
very
little
about
the
matter
however
you
must
tell
me
and
i
will
do
whatever
you
direct
at
hearing
this
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
were
delighted
now
we
have
got
the
right
sort
of
king
they
said
and
both
wagged
their
heads
with
joy
so
king
aldebert
was
crowned
and
there
were
great
rejoicings
all
over
the
country
early
next
morning
he
was
up
all
ready
to
receive
his
ministers
and
first
came
the
prime
minister
your
majesty
said
he
i
come
to
you
on
an
affair
of
much
importance
a
great
part
of
our
city
is
falling
down
and
it
is
very
necessary
that
we
should
rebuild
it
at
once
if
you
will
command
it
therefore
i
will
see
that
it
is
done
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
right
said
the
king
pray
let
them
begin
building
at
once
and
the
prime
minister
went
away
delighted
scarcely
had
he
gone
when
in
came
the
your
majesty
said
he
i
wish
to
lay
before
you
the
state
of
our
army
our
soldiers
have
had
a
great
deal
of
fighting
to
do
lately
and
are
beginning
to
be
discontented
but
the
late
king
your
uncle
would
never
attend
to
their
wants
pray
do
what
you
like
said
king
aldebert
to
satisfy
them
said
the
i
think
that
we
should
double
their
pay
this
would
keep
them
in
a
good
humour
and
all
will
go
well
by
all
means
that
will
certainly
be
the
best
way
said
aldebert
let
it
be
given
to
them
at
once
and
on
hearing
this
the
went
away
right
merrily
when
he
had
gone
there
came
in
the
chancellor
with
a
long
face
your
majesty
he
said
i
have
this
morning
been
to
the
treasury
and
i
find
that
there
is
scarcely
any
money
left
the
late
king
your
uncle
spent
so
much
in
spite
of
all
i
could
say
that
now
it
is
almost
all
gone
your
majesty
must
now
save
all
you
can
for
the
next
year
or
two
and
you
ought
also
to
lower
the
soldiers
pay
and
stop
all
public
works
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
quite
right
cried
the
king
you
know
best
let
it
be
done
as
you
wish
but
next
morning
in
came
the
prime
minister
with
a
frowning
face
how
is
this
your
majesty
cried
he
just
as
we
are
beginning
our
buildings
the
chancellor
comes
and
tells
us
that
we
are
not
to
have
any
money
to
build
with
he
had
not
done
speaking
when
the
burst
into
the
room
unable
to
conceal
his
rage
yesterday
your
majesty
told
me
that
all
the
soldiers
should
have
double
pay
and
this
morning
i
hear
that
instead
of
that
their
wages
are
to
be
lowered
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
chancellor
who
came
running
in
looking
much
excited
your
majesty
he
cried
did
you
not
yesterday
say
we
were
now
to
begin
saving
and
that
i
was
not
to
allow
any
more
money
to
be
spent
and
that
the
army
must
do
with
less
pay
and
then
all
three
began
to
quarrel
among
themselves
when
he
saw
how
angry
they
were
king
aldebert
took
off
his
crown
and
said
i
am
sure
you
are
each
of
you
quite
right
but
i
think
i
am
scarcely
fit
to
be
a
king
indeed
i
think
you
had
better
find
my
cousin
alderete
and
let
him
be
crowned
and
i
will
seek
my
fortune
elsewhere
and
he
had
slipped
out
of
the
room
and
run
downstairs
and
out
of
the
palace
before
they
could
stop
him
he
went
briskly
down
the
highroad
into
the
country
the
same
way
that
aldovrand
had
gone
after
he
had
gone
some
way
he
met
a
travelling
tinker
who
sat
by
the
roadside
mending
tin
cans
with
his
little
fire
at
his
side
aldebert
stood
watching
him
and
at
last
said
how
cleverly
you
mend
those
holes
you
must
lead
a
pleasant
life
going
from
house
to
house
in
the
green
lanes
mending
wares
do
you
think
i
could
learn
how
to
do
it
if
you
would
teach
me
the
tinker
who
was
an
old
man
looked
at
him
and
said
well
i
do
mind
giving
you
a
trial
if
you
like
to
come
with
me
for
i
want
a
strong
young
man
sometimes
to
help
me
wheel
my
little
cart
and
i
teach
you
my
trade
and
we
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
so
aldebert
was
delighted
and
went
with
the
tinker
when
they
knew
he
was
really
gone
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
this
will
never
do
cried
they
we
must
go
at
once
to
prince
alderete
and
let
us
hope
he
may
do
better
than
his
cousins
when
prince
alderete
heard
that
it
was
his
turn
to
reign
he
jumped
for
joy
now
cried
he
at
last
i
will
show
what
a
king
should
really
be
like
my
cousins
were
neither
of
them
any
good
but
they
shall
now
see
how
different
i
will
be
so
he
was
crowned
and
again
there
were
great
rejoicings
all
over
the
country
next
day
he
sat
in
state
to
receive
the
chancellor
and
prime
minister
and
hear
what
they
had
to
say
my
friends
said
he
to
them
a
good
king
ought
to
be
like
a
father
to
his
people
and
this
is
what
i
mean
to
be
i
mean
to
arrange
everything
for
them
myself
and
if
they
will
only
obey
me
and
do
as
i
direct
they
are
sure
to
be
both
prosperous
and
happy
on
hearing
this
both
prime
minister
and
chancellor
looked
anxious
and
the
chancellor
said
i
fear
your
majesty
your
people
will
not
like
to
be
too
much
meddled
with
at
this
the
king
was
very
angry
and
bid
them
see
about
their
own
business
and
not
presume
to
teach
him
his
when
they
had
gone
he
went
to
take
a
drive
in
his
city
that
he
might
see
it
and
know
it
well
but
directly
he
returned
to
the
palace
he
sent
for
the
prime
minister
and
when
he
had
arrived
said
i
already
see
much
to
be
altered
in
my
kingdom
i
do
not
like
the
houses
in
which
many
of
the
people
dwell
nor
indeed
the
dresses
they
wear
but
what
strikes
me
most
of
all
is
that
wherever
i
go
i
smell
a
strong
smell
of
pea
soup
now
nothing
is
so
unwholesome
as
pea
soup
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
right
in
me
to
allow
the
people
to
go
on
eating
it
i
command
therefore
that
no
one
shall
again
make
or
eat
pea
soup
within
my
realm
on
pain
of
death
again
the
prime
minister
looked
very
grave
and
began
to
say
your
majesty
your
subjects
will
surely
not
like
to
be
hindered
from
eating
and
drinking
what
pleases
them
but
the
king
cried
out
in
a
rage
go
at
once
and
do
as
i
bid
you
so
the
prime
minister
had
to
obey
early
next
morning
when
the
king
arose
he
heard
a
great
hubbub
under
his
window
and
when
he
went
to
see
what
it
was
he
saw
a
vast
mob
of
people
all
shouting
the
king
the
king
where
is
this
king
who
would
dictate
to
us
what
we
shall
eat
and
drink
when
he
saw
them
he
was
terribly
frightened
and
at
once
sent
off
for
the
prime
minister
and
chancellor
to
come
to
his
aid
pray
go
and
tell
them
to
eat
what
they
like
he
cried
when
they
arrived
but
do
you
know
i
find
it
will
not
at
all
suit
me
to
be
king
you
had
best
try
aldovrand
or
aldebert
again
and
so
saying
he
took
off
his
crown
and
laid
it
down
and
slipped
away
out
of
the
palace
before
either
prime
minister
or
chancellor
could
stop
him
he
went
out
of
the
back
door
and
ran
and
ran
and
ran
till
he
had
left
the
town
far
behind
and
came
to
the
country
fields
and
lanes
the
same
way
that
his
two
cousins
had
gone
and
as
he
went
he
met
a
sweep
trudging
along
carrying
his
long
brooms
over
his
shoulder
my
friend
cried
alderete
stopping
him
of
all
things
in
the
world
i
should
like
to
be
a
sweep
and
learn
how
to
sweep
chimneys
may
i
go
with
you
and
will
you
teach
me
your
trade
the
sweep
looked
surprised
but
said
yes
alderete
could
go
with
him
if
he
chose
and
as
he
was
now
going
on
to
the
farmhouses
on
the
road
to
sweep
the
chimneys
he
could
begin
at
once
so
alderete
went
with
the
sweep
carrying
some
of
his
brooms
for
him
after
a
time
the
people
outside
the
palace
grew
quiet
when
they
heard
that
the
king
would
not
interfere
with
them
further
and
when
all
was
again
still
the
prime
minister
and
chancellor
went
to
seek
the
king
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
palace
this
will
never
do
cried
they
we
must
have
a
king
somehow
so
we
had
best
have
back
one
of
the
others
so
they
started
to
look
for
aldovrand
or
aldebert
they
sought
them
all
over
the
city
and
at
last
they
came
into
the
same
country
road
down
which
the
three
cousins
had
gone
and
there
they
saw
aldovrand
lying
in
a
meadow
watching
his
flock
of
geese
good
day
my
friends
cried
he
when
he
saw
them
and
how
are
things
going
on
at
the
palace
i
hope
my
cousins
like
reigning
better
than
i
did
now
here
i
lie
peacefully
all
day
long
and
watch
my
geese
and
it
is
much
nicer
than
being
king
then
the
prime
minister
and
chancellor
told
him
all
that
had
happened
and
begged
that
he
would
come
back
with
them
to
the
palace
again
but
at
this
aldovrand
laughed
outright
illustration
now
here
i
lie
peacefully
all
day
long
and
watch
my
geese
and
it
is
much
nicer
than
being
p
no
indeed
cried
he
i
would
not
be
king
again
for
any
man
living
you
had
best
go
and
seek
my
cousin
aldebert
and
ask
him
i
saw
him
go
down
the
road
with
a
tinker
helping
him
to
mend
his
tins
so
go
and
ask
him
and
leave
me
to
mind
my
geese
in
peace
so
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
had
to
seek
still
farther
they
trudged
on
and
on
till
at
last
they
met
aldebert
who
sat
by
the
side
of
the
road
mending
a
tin
kettle
and
whistling
cheerily
heyday
whom
have
we
here
cried
he
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
and
i
am
right
glad
to
see
you
both
see
how
clever
i
have
grown
i
am
learning
to
be
a
tinker
and
i
mended
that
hole
all
myself
then
the
prime
minister
and
chancellor
begged
him
to
leave
his
pots
and
come
back
to
the
palace
and
be
king
but
he
fell
to
work
again
harder
than
ever
and
said
no
indeed
go
and
ask
my
cousins
who
are
both
much
cleverer
than
i
really
do
do
for
it
at
all
but
i
make
a
very
good
tinker
and
i
like
that
much
better
then
what
can
we
do
cried
the
prime
minister
for
we
do
know
where
alderete
has
gone
i
saw
him
go
by
here
with
a
sweep
a
little
time
ago
said
aldebert
and
he
went
into
that
farmhouse
yonder
so
you
had
best
seek
him
there
so
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
went
on
to
the
farmhouse
at
the
door
stood
the
farmer
wife
but
when
they
asked
her
if
she
had
seen
the
king
go
by
she
stared
with
surprise
nay
said
she
no
one
has
been
here
but
our
sweep
and
his
apprentice
he
is
in
there
sweeping
the
chimney
now
on
hearing
this
the
prime
minister
and
chancellor
at
once
ran
into
the
farmhouse
and
saw
the
old
sweep
standing
by
the
kitchen
and
where
is
the
other
sweep
cried
they
he
is
gone
up
the
chimney
and
is
just
going
to
begin
sweeping
said
the
old
man
so
if
you
want
to
speak
to
him
you
must
shout
so
they
shouted
and
called
king
alderete
king
alderete
as
loud
as
ever
they
could
but
he
did
not
hear
then
the
chancellor
knelt
in
front
of
the
grate
and
put
his
head
up
the
chimney
and
called
king
alderete
king
alderete
it
is
the
prime
minister
and
i
the
chancellor
come
to
fetch
your
majesty
back
to
the
palace
when
alderete
heard
him
up
the
chimney
he
trembled
in
every
limb
but
he
replied
i
not
going
to
come
down
i
do
want
to
be
king
i
am
going
to
be
a
sweep
and
i
like
that
much
better
i
sha
come
down
till
you
are
gone
away
and
now
you
had
best
go
quickly
for
i
am
going
to
begin
sweeping
and
all
the
soot
will
fall
on
your
head
and
then
they
heard
the
rattle
of
the
broom
in
the
chimney
and
a
whole
shower
of
soot
fell
on
the
chancellor
head
the
prime
minister
and
the
chancellor
turned
back
to
the
city
very
disconsolately
we
must
go
and
look
for
a
king
elsewhere
they
said
it
is
no
use
troubling
about
aldovrand
aldebert
and
alderete
so
they
left
the
one
to
his
geese
and
one
to
his
tins
and
the
other
to
sweep
chimneys
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
three
clever
kings
illustration
the
wise
princess
illustration
once
upon
a
time
lived
a
king
whose
wife
was
dead
and
who
had
one
little
daughter
who
was
named
fernanda
she
was
very
good
and
pretty
but
when
she
was
a
child
she
vexed
all
her
ladies
by
asking
them
questions
about
everything
she
saw
your
highness
should
not
wish
to
know
too
much
they
told
her
whereat
princess
fernanda
threw
up
her
little
head
and
said
i
want
to
know
everything
as
she
grew
up
she
had
masters
and
mistresses
to
teach
her
and
learnt
every
language
and
every
science
but
still
she
said
it
is
not
enough
i
want
to
know
more
in
a
deep
cave
underground
there
lived
an
old
wizard
who
was
so
wise
that
his
face
was
black
with
wrinkles
and
his
long
white
beard
flowed
to
his
feet
he
knew
all
sorts
of
magic
and
every
day
and
night
sat
poring
over
his
books
till
now
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
for
him
to
learn
one
night
after
every
one
was
asleep
princess
fernanda
rose
and
slipped
softly
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
palace
unheard
by
any
one
and
stole
away
to
the
wizard
cave
the
old
man
was
sitting
on
his
low
stool
reading
out
of
an
immense
book
by
a
dim
green
light
but
he
raised
his
eyes
as
the
princess
entered
at
the
low
doorway
and
looked
at
her
she
wore
a
blue
and
silver
robe
but
her
bright
hair
was
unbound
and
fell
in
ripples
to
her
waist
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
with
me
he
asked
shortly
i
am
the
princess
fernanda
she
said
and
i
wish
to
be
your
pupil
teach
me
all
you
know
why
do
you
wish
for
that
said
the
wizard
you
will
not
be
better
or
happier
for
it
i
am
not
happy
now
said
the
princess
sighing
wearily
teach
me
and
you
shall
find
me
an
apt
pupil
and
i
will
pay
you
with
gold
i
will
not
have
your
gold
said
the
wizard
but
come
to
me
every
night
at
this
hour
and
in
three
years
you
shall
know
all
i
do
so
every
night
the
princess
went
down
to
the
wizard
cave
while
all
the
court
were
sleeping
and
the
people
wondered
at
her
more
and
more
and
said
how
much
she
knows
how
wise
she
is
when
the
three
years
had
gone
by
the
wizard
said
to
her
go
i
can
teach
you
no
more
now
you
are
as
wise
as
i
then
the
princess
thanked
him
and
went
back
to
her
father
palace
she
was
very
wise
she
knew
the
languages
of
all
animals
the
fishes
came
from
the
deep
at
her
call
and
the
birds
from
the
trees
she
could
tell
when
the
winds
would
rise
and
when
the
sea
would
be
still
she
could
have
turned
her
enemies
to
stone
or
given
untold
wealth
to
her
friends
but
for
all
that
when
she
smiled
her
lips
were
very
sad
and
her
eyes
were
always
full
of
care
she
said
she
was
weary
and
her
father
thought
she
was
sick
and
would
have
sent
for
the
physicians
but
she
stopped
him
how
should
physicians
help
me
my
father
she
said
seeing
that
i
know
more
than
they
one
night
a
year
after
she
had
taken
her
last
lesson
from
the
wizard
she
arose
and
returned
to
his
cave
and
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
her
standing
before
him
as
formerly
what
do
you
want
he
said
i
have
taught
you
all
i
know
you
have
taught
me
much
she
said
falling
on
her
knees
beside
him
yet
i
am
ignorant
of
one
thing
teach
me
that
also
to
be
nay
said
the
wizard
with
a
very
mournful
smile
i
can
not
teach
you
that
for
i
do
not
know
it
myself
go
and
ask
it
of
them
who
know
and
are
wiser
than
i
illustration
then
the
princess
left
the
cave
and
wandered
down
to
the
p
then
the
princess
left
the
cave
and
wandered
down
to
the
all
that
night
she
spent
sitting
on
a
rock
that
jutted
out
into
the
sea
watching
the
wild
sky
and
the
moon
coming
and
going
behind
the
clouds
the
sea
dashed
up
around
her
and
the
wind
blew
but
she
did
not
fear
them
and
when
the
sun
rose
the
waters
were
still
and
the
wind
fell
a
skylark
rose
from
the
fields
and
flew
straight
up
to
heaven
singing
as
though
his
heart
would
burst
with
pure
joy
surely
that
bird
is
happy
said
the
princess
to
herself
and
she
called
it
in
its
own
tongue
why
do
you
sing
she
asked
i
sing
because
i
am
so
happy
answered
the
lark
and
why
are
you
so
happy
asked
the
princess
so
happy
said
the
lark
god
is
so
good
the
sky
is
so
blue
and
the
fields
are
so
green
is
that
not
enough
to
make
me
happy
teach
me
then
that
i
may
be
happy
too
said
princess
fernanda
i
can
not
said
the
lark
i
do
know
how
to
teach
and
then
he
rose
singing
into
the
blue
overhead
and
princess
fernanda
sighed
and
turned
back
towards
the
palace
outside
her
door
she
met
her
little
who
barked
and
jumped
for
joy
on
seeing
her
little
dog
she
said
poor
little
dog
are
you
so
glad
to
see
me
why
are
you
so
happy
why
am
i
so
happy
said
the
little
dog
surprised
i
have
plenty
to
eat
and
a
soft
cushion
to
rest
upon
and
you
to
caress
me
is
not
it
enough
to
make
me
happy
it
is
not
enough
for
me
said
the
princess
sighing
but
the
little
dog
only
wagged
his
tail
and
licked
her
hand
inside
her
room
was
the
princess
favourite
little
maid
doris
folding
up
her
dresses
doris
she
said
you
look
very
merry
why
are
you
so
happy
please
your
royal
highness
i
am
going
to
the
fair
answered
doris
and
luke
is
to
meet
me
there
only
she
added
pouting
a
little
i
wish
i
had
a
pretty
new
hat
to
wear
with
my
new
dress
then
you
are
not
perfectly
happy
so
you
can
not
teach
me
said
princess
fernanda
and
then
she
sighed
again
in
the
evening
at
sunset
she
arose
and
went
out
into
the
village
and
at
the
door
of
the
first
cottage
to
which
she
came
sat
a
woman
nursing
a
baby
and
hushing
it
to
sleep
the
baby
was
fat
and
rosy
and
the
mother
looked
down
at
it
proudly
the
princess
stopped
and
spoke
to
her
you
have
a
fine
little
child
there
she
said
surely
you
must
be
very
happy
the
woman
smiled
yes
she
said
so
i
am
only
just
now
my
goodman
is
out
fishing
and
as
he
rather
late
it
makes
me
anxious
then
you
could
not
teach
me
said
the
princess
sighing
to
herself
as
she
moved
away
she
wandered
on
till
she
came
to
a
church
which
she
entered
all
was
still
within
for
the
church
was
empty
but
before
the
altar
on
a
splendid
bier
lay
the
body
of
a
young
man
who
had
been
killed
in
the
war
he
was
dressed
in
his
gay
uniform
and
his
breast
was
covered
with
medals
and
his
sword
lay
beside
him
he
was
shot
through
the
heart
but
his
face
was
peaceful
and
his
lips
were
smiling
the
princess
walked
to
his
side
and
looked
at
the
quiet
face
then
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
cold
forehead
and
envied
the
soldier
if
he
could
speak
she
said
he
surely
could
teach
me
no
living
mouth
could
ever
smile
like
that
then
she
looked
up
and
saw
a
white
angel
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
bier
and
she
knew
it
was
death
you
have
taught
him
she
said
holding
out
her
arms
will
you
not
teach
me
to
smile
like
that
nay
said
death
pointing
to
the
medals
on
the
dead
man
breast
i
taught
him
whilst
he
was
doing
his
duty
i
can
not
teach
you
and
so
saying
he
vanished
from
her
sight
she
went
out
from
the
church
down
to
the
there
was
a
high
sea
and
a
great
wind
a
little
child
had
been
playing
on
a
row
of
rocks
and
had
slipped
off
them
into
the
water
and
was
struggling
among
the
waves
and
would
soon
be
drowned
for
he
was
beyond
his
depth
in
the
water
when
the
princess
saw
him
she
plunged
into
the
water
and
swam
to
where
the
child
was
and
taking
him
in
her
arms
placed
him
safely
on
the
rocks
again
but
the
waves
were
so
strong
that
she
could
scarcely
keep
above
them
as
she
tried
to
seize
the
rocks
she
saw
death
coming
over
the
water
towards
her
and
she
turned
to
meet
him
gladly
now
said
he
clasping
her
in
his
arms
i
will
teach
you
all
you
want
to
know
and
he
drew
her
under
the
water
and
she
died
the
kings
servants
found
her
lying
on
the
shore
with
her
face
white
and
her
lips
cold
but
smiling
as
they
had
never
smiled
before
and
her
face
was
very
calm
they
carried
her
home
and
she
was
laid
out
in
great
state
covered
with
gold
and
silver
she
was
so
wise
sobbed
her
little
maid
as
she
placed
flowers
in
the
cold
hand
she
knew
everything
not
everything
said
the
skylark
from
the
window
for
she
asked
me
ignorant
though
i
am
to
teach
her
how
to
be
happy
that
was
the
one
thing
i
could
not
teach
her
said
the
old
wizard
looking
at
the
dead
princess
face
yet
i
think
now
she
must
be
wiser
than
i
and
have
learned
that
too
for
see
how
she
smiles
