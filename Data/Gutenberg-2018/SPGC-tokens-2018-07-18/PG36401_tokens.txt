kendall
placed
in
her
hands
a
great
red
rose
for
a
time
margaret
regarded
him
with
troubled
eyes
a
mob
of
small
boys
had
found
an
object
upon
which
to
vent
their
wildest
mischief
margaret
crossed
the
room
and
touched
the
man
shoulder
the
turn
of
the
tide
chapter
i
margaret
had
been
home
two
hours
two
hours
of
breathless
questions
answers
tears
and
laughter
two
hours
of
delighted
wandering
about
the
house
and
grounds
in
the
nursery
she
had
seen
the
little
woolly
dog
that
lay
on
the
floor
just
as
she
had
left
it
five
years
before
and
out
on
the
veranda
steps
she
had
seen
the
great
stone
lions
that
had
never
quite
faded
from
her
memory
and
always
at
her
side
had
walked
the
lady
of
her
dreams
only
now
the
lady
was
very
real
with
eyes
that
smiled
on
one
so
lovingly
and
lips
and
hands
that
kissed
and
caressed
one
so
tenderly
and
this
is
home
my
home
margaret
asked
in
unbelieving
wonder
yes
dear
answered
kendall
and
you
are
my
mother
and
i
am
margaret
kendall
your
little
girl
yes
and
the
little
dog
on
the
floor
that
was
mine
and
and
it
been
there
ever
since
yes
ever
since
you
left
it
there
long
ago
i
i
could
not
bear
to
have
any
one
move
it
or
touch
it
and
i
was
lost
then
right
then
no
dear
we
traveled
about
for
almost
a
year
you
were
five
when
i
lost
you
kendall
voice
shook
unconsciously
she
drew
margaret
into
a
closer
embrace
even
now
she
was
scarcely
sure
that
it
was
margaret
this
little
maid
who
had
stepped
so
suddenly
out
of
the
great
silence
that
had
closed
about
her
four
long
years
before
margaret
laughed
softly
and
nestled
in
the
encircling
arms
i
like
it
this
she
confided
shyly
you
see
i
i
hai
had
it
before
even
the
did
do
this
the
margaret
hesitated
her
grave
eyes
were
on
her
mother
face
i
suppose
she
was
you
she
said
then
slowly
i
saw
her
nights
mostly
but
she
never
stayed
and
when
i
tried
to
catch
her
she
she
was
just
air
and
was
there
at
all
and
i
did
want
her
so
bad
of
course
you
did
sweetheart
choked
kendall
tremulously
and
did
she
ever
stay
when
was
it
you
saw
her
first
margaret
frowned
i
do
seem
to
know
she
answered
she
was
thinking
of
what
spencer
had
told
her
and
of
what
she
herself
remembered
of
those
four
years
of
her
life
you
see
first
i
was
lost
and
bobby
mcginnis
found
me
anyhow
spencer
says
he
did
but
i
do
seem
to
remember
things
was
all
mixed
up
there
did
seem
to
be
anybody
that
wanted
me
but
there
would
anybody
let
me
go
and
they
made
me
sew
all
the
time
on
things
that
was
big
and
homely
and
then
another
man
took
me
and
made
me
paste
up
bags
say
did
you
ever
paste
bags
no
dear
kendall
shivered
well
you
do
want
to
volunteered
margaret
and
to
her
thin
little
face
came
the
look
that
her
mother
had
already
seen
on
it
once
or
twice
that
afternoon
the
look
of
a
child
who
knows
what
it
means
to
fight
for
life
itself
in
the
slums
of
a
great
city
they
ai
a
mite
nice
bags
ai
and
the
paste
sticks
horrid
and
smells
margaret
dearest
how
could
you
bear
it
shuddered
kendall
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
margaret
saw
the
tears
and
understood
this
tender
mother
of
hers
was
grieved
she
must
be
comforted
to
the
best
of
her
ability
therefore
margaret
promptly
proceeded
to
administer
that
comfort
pooh
nothin
she
asserted
stoutly
besides
i
runned
away
and
then
i
had
a
tiptop
place
a
whole
corner
of
mis
whalen
kitchen
and
jest
me
and
patty
and
the
twins
to
stay
in
it
we
divvied
up
everythin
and
some
days
we
had
heaps
to
eat
truly
we
did
heaps
and
i
went
to
two
times
and
of
course
there
i
had
everythin
even
beds
with
sheets
you
know
and
margaret
margaret
do
dear
interrupted
her
mother
i
ca
bear
even
to
think
of
it
margaret
eyes
grew
puzzled
but
that
was
all
of
it
she
protested
earnestly
why
i
did
paste
bags
nor
sew
buttons
and
nobody
did
strike
me
for
not
doin
neither
and
mis
whalen
was
good
and
showed
me
how
to
make
flowers
for
pay
too
and
yes
dear
i
know
interposed
kendall
again
but
suppose
we
do
think
any
more
of
all
that
sweetheart
you
are
home
now
darling
right
here
with
mother
come
we
will
go
out
into
the
garden
to
kendall
it
seemed
at
the
moment
that
only
god
blessed
was
wide
enough
and
beautiful
enough
to
clear
from
her
eyes
the
pictures
margaret
words
had
painted
out
in
the
garden
margaret
drew
a
long
breath
oh
she
cooed
softly
caressing
with
her
cheek
a
great
red
rose
i
knew
flowers
smelled
good
but
i
did
find
it
out
for
sure
till
i
went
to
that
first
time
you
see
the
kind
we
made
was
cloth
and
stiff
and
they
did
smell
good
a
mite
oh
you
picked
it
she
broke
off
as
kendall
placed
in
her
hands
the
great
red
rose
yes
pick
all
you
like
dear
smiled
kendall
reaching
for
another
flower
but
they
die
stammered
margaret
and
then
the
others
wo
see
them
the
what
others
dear
why
the
other
folks
that
live
here
you
know
and
walk
out
here
too
kendall
laughed
merrily
but
there
are
any
others
dear
the
flowers
are
all
ours
no
one
else
lives
here
margaret
stopped
short
in
the
garden
path
and
faced
her
mother
what
not
any
one
in
all
that
big
house
why
no
dear
of
course
not
there
is
no
one
except
old
and
barrett
who
keep
the
house
and
grounds
in
order
we
have
it
all
to
ourselves
margaret
was
silent
she
turned
and
walked
slowly
along
the
path
at
her
mother
side
on
her
face
was
a
puzzled
questioning
to
her
eyes
was
gradually
coming
a
frightened
doubt
alone
just
they
two
with
the
little
old
man
and
the
little
old
woman
in
the
kitchen
who
did
not
take
up
any
room
at
all
why
back
in
the
alley
there
were
patty
the
twins
and
all
the
whalens
and
they
had
only
one
room
it
was
like
that
too
everywhere
all
through
the
alley
so
many
many
people
so
little
room
for
them
yet
here
here
was
this
great
house
all
windows
and
doors
and
soft
carpets
and
pretty
pictures
and
only
two
three
four
people
to
enjoy
it
all
why
had
not
her
mother
asked
even
to
herself
margaret
could
not
say
the
words
she
shut
her
lips
tight
and
threw
a
hurried
look
into
the
face
of
the
woman
at
her
side
this
dear
this
beautiful
new
mother
as
if
there
could
be
any
question
of
her
goodness
and
kindness
very
likely
anyway
there
were
not
any
poor
margaret
eyes
cleared
suddenly
she
turned
a
radiant
face
on
her
mother
oh
i
know
she
cried
in
triumph
there
ai
any
poor
folks
here
and
so
you
could
do
it
kendall
looked
puzzled
folks
do
it
she
questioned
yes
poor
folks
like
patty
and
the
whalens
and
so
you
could
ask
to
live
with
you
kendall
sat
down
abruptly
near
her
was
a
garden
settee
she
felt
particularly
glad
of
its
support
just
then
and
of
course
you
did
know
about
the
whalens
and
patty
went
on
margaret
eagerly
and
so
you
could
ask
them
neither
but
you
do
now
and
they
just
love
to
come
i
know
love
to
to
come
stammered
kendall
gazing
blankly
into
the
glowing
young
face
before
her
of
course
they
would
nodded
margaret
dancing
up
and
down
and
clapping
her
hands
would
you
if
you
did
have
nothin
but
a
room
right
down
under
the
sidewalk
and
there
was
such
a
heap
of
folks
in
it
why
here
there
everythin
for
and
oh
i
so
glad
they
good
to
me
so
good
first
mis
whalen
took
in
patty
and
the
twins
when
the
rent
man
dumped
out
on
the
sidewalk
and
she
gave
a
whole
corner
of
her
kitchen
and
then
when
i
runned
away
from
the
patty
and
the
twins
took
me
in
and
now
i
can
pay
back
for
it
all
i
can
pay
back
i
so
glad
kendall
fell
back
limply
against
the
garden
seat
twice
she
opened
her
lips
and
closed
them
again
her
face
flushed
then
paled
and
her
hands
grew
cold
in
her
lap
this
dancing
little
maid
with
the
sunlit
hair
and
the
astounding
proposition
to
adopt
into
their
home
two
whole
families
from
the
slums
of
new
york
was
margaret
her
own
little
margaret
lost
so
long
ago
and
now
so
miraculously
restored
to
her
as
if
she
could
refuse
any
request
however
wild
from
margaret
but
this
but
sweetheart
perhaps
they
they
would
want
to
go
away
forever
and
leave
their
home
she
remonstrated
at
last
feebly
the
child
frowned
her
finger
to
her
lips
well
anyhow
we
can
ask
them
she
declared
after
a
minute
her
face
clearing
suppose
we
we
make
it
a
visit
first
suggested
kendall
feverishly
by
and
by
after
i
had
you
all
to
myself
for
a
little
while
you
shall
ask
them
to
to
visit
you
o
bully
agreed
margaret
in
swift
delight
that
will
be
nicest
it
then
they
can
see
how
they
like
it
but
there
they
like
it
all
right
they
could
help
it
and
how
how
many
are
there
questioned
kendall
moistening
her
dry
lips
and
feeling
profoundly
thankful
for
even
this
respite
from
the
proposed
wholesale
adoption
why
let
see
margaret
held
up
her
fingers
and
checked
off
her
prospective
guests
there
patty
she
the
oldest
and
arabella
and
clarabella
they
the
twins
an
they
my
age
you
know
that
the
murphys
and
then
there
all
the
whalens
tom
peter
mary
jamie
and
oh
i
dunno
six
or
eight
maybe
with
mis
whalen
and
her
husband
but
after
all
it
do
make
so
very
much
just
how
many
there
are
does
it
she
added
with
a
happy
little
skip
and
jump
there
heaps
of
room
here
for
any
of
and
i
never
can
remember
just
how
many
there
are
without
forgettin
some
of
you
you
do
mind
if
i
do
name
all
now
and
she
gazed
earnestly
into
her
mother
face
no
dear
no
assured
kendall
hurriedly
you
you
have
named
quite
enough
and
now
we
go
down
to
the
brook
we
have
seen
half
of
five
oaks
yet
and
once
more
she
tried
to
make
the
joyous
present
drive
from
her
daughter
thoughts
the
grievous
past
chapter
ii
it
was
not
long
before
all
houghtonsville
knew
the
story
and
there
was
not
a
man
woman
or
child
in
the
town
that
did
not
take
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
little
maid
at
five
oaks
who
had
passed
through
so
amazing
an
experience
to
be
lost
at
five
years
of
age
in
a
great
city
to
be
snatched
from
wealth
happiness
and
a
loving
mother
arms
only
to
be
thrust
instantly
into
poverty
misery
and
loneliness
and
then
to
be
after
four
long
years
suddenly
returned
no
wonder
houghtonsville
held
its
breath
and
questioned
if
it
all
indeed
were
true
bit
by
bit
the
little
girl
history
was
related
in
every
house
in
town
and
many
a
woman
and
some
men
wept
over
the
tale
of
how
the
little
fingers
had
sewed
on
buttons
in
the
attic
sweat
shop
and
pasted
bags
in
the
cellar
the
story
of
the
coöperative
housekeeping
establishment
in
one
corner
of
the
basement
kitchen
where
she
together
with
patty
and
the
twins
divvied
up
the
day
haul
that
too
came
in
for
its
share
of
exclamatory
adjectives
as
did
the
account
of
how
she
was
finally
discovered
through
her
finding
her
own
name
over
the
little
at
the
little
bed
that
kendall
had
endowed
in
the
name
of
her
lost
daughter
in
the
children
vacation
home
for
the
poor
little
waifs
from
the
city
an
ter
think
of
her
findin
her
own
baby
jest
by
givin
some
other
woman
baby
a
bit
of
joy
cried
merton
of
the
old
red
farmhouse
when
the
story
was
told
to
her
but
there
ai
that
what
always
doin
for
folks
somethin
ter
make
happy
did
she
bring
my
own
child
sadie
an
the
boy
bobby
back
from
the
city
and
sadie
gettin
well
an
strong
on
the
farm
here
and
it
a
comfort
ter
me
too
when
i
remember
was
bobby
who
first
found
the
little
margaret
cryin
in
the
streets
there
in
new
york
an
took
her
home
ter
my
sadie
much
sadie
could
do
for
the
poor
little
lamb
but
she
did
what
she
could
till
old
sullivan
got
his
claws
on
her
and
kept
her
shut
up
out
o
sight
but
there
what
past
is
past
and
there
ai
no
use
frettin
over
it
she
home
now
in
her
own
mother
arms
and
thinkin
it
the
whole
town
that
rejoicin
and
the
whole
town
did
rejoice
and
many
and
various
were
the
ways
the
townspeople
took
to
show
it
the
houghtonsville
brass
band
marched
in
full
uniform
to
five
oaks
one
evening
and
gave
a
serenade
with
red
fire
and
rockets
much
to
kendall
embarrassment
and
delight
the
ladies
aid
society
gave
a
tea
with
kendall
and
margaret
as
a
kind
of
pivot
around
which
the
entire
affair
revolved
this
time
to
the
embarrassment
of
both
kendall
and
her
daughter
the
minister
of
the
methodist
church
appointed
a
day
of
prayer
and
thanksgiving
in
commemoration
of
the
homecoming
of
the
wanderer
and
the
town
poet
published
in
the
a
poem
on
the
lost
and
found
nor
was
this
all
to
kendall
it
seemed
that
almost
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
place
came
to
her
door
with
inquiries
and
congratulations
together
with
all
sorts
of
offerings
from
flowers
and
frosted
cakes
to
tidies
and
worked
bedspreads
she
was
not
ungrateful
certainly
but
she
was
overwhelmed
not
only
the
cakes
and
the
tidies
however
gave
kendall
food
for
thought
during
those
first
few
days
after
margaret
return
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
it
was
of
necessity
a
period
of
adjustment
and
to
kendall
consternation
there
was
every
indication
of
friction
if
not
disaster
for
four
years
now
her
young
daughter
had
been
away
from
her
tender
care
and
influence
and
for
only
one
of
those
four
years
the
last
had
she
come
under
the
influence
of
any
sort
of
refinement
or
culture
and
then
under
only
such
as
a
city
missionary
and
an
overworked
schoolteacher
could
afford
supplemented
by
the
two
trips
to
to
be
sure
behind
it
all
had
been
margaret
careful
training
for
the
first
five
years
of
her
life
and
it
was
because
of
this
training
that
she
had
so
quickly
yielded
to
what
good
influences
she
had
known
in
the
last
year
the
alley
however
was
not
five
oaks
and
the
standards
of
one
did
not
measure
to
those
of
the
other
it
was
not
easy
for
mag
of
the
alley
to
become
at
once
margaret
kendall
the
dainty
little
daughter
of
a
fastidious
mother
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
who
had
gone
to
new
york
and
brought
margaret
home
and
who
knew
her
as
she
was
kendall
went
for
advice
what
shall
i
do
she
asked
anxiously
a
hundred
times
a
day
the
dear
child
speech
movements
and
actions
are
not
what
i
like
them
to
be
and
yet
if
i
correct
each
one
be
a
continual
all
day
why
doctor
the
child
will
hate
me
as
if
any
one
could
do
that
smiled
the
doctor
and
at
the
look
in
his
eyes
kendall
dropped
her
own
the
happiness
that
had
come
to
her
with
this
man
love
was
very
new
she
had
scarcely
yet
looked
it
squarely
in
the
face
the
child
is
so
good
and
loving
she
went
on
a
little
hurriedly
that
it
makes
it
all
the
harder
but
i
must
do
something
only
this
morning
she
told
the
minister
that
she
thought
houghtonsville
was
a
place
and
that
the
people
were
her
table
manners
poor
child
i
ran
away
from
the
table
and
cried
like
a
baby
the
first
time
i
saw
her
eat
and
yet
perhaps
the
very
next
thing
she
does
will
be
so
dainty
and
sweet
that
i
could
declare
the
other
was
all
a
dream
doctor
what
shall
i
do
i
know
i
know
nodded
the
man
i
have
seen
it
myself
but
dear
she
learn
she
learn
wonderfully
fast
you
see
it
in
her
the
gentleness
and
the
refinement
she
have
to
be
corrected
some
of
course
it
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
be
but
she
come
out
straight
her
heart
is
all
right
kendall
laughed
softly
her
heart
doctor
she
exclaimed
just
there
lies
the
greatest
problem
of
all
the
one
creed
of
her
life
is
to
up
and
how
going
to
teach
her
ordinary
ideas
of
living
without
shattering
all
her
faith
in
me
i
do
know
why
harry
kendall
voice
was
tragic
she
gazes
at
me
with
round
eyes
of
horror
because
i
have
two
coats
and
two
hats
and
two
loaves
of
bread
and
have
yet
up
with
some
one
who
has
none
so
far
her
horror
is
tempered
by
the
fact
that
she
is
sure
i
did
know
before
that
there
were
any
people
who
did
not
have
all
these
things
now
that
she
has
told
me
of
them
she
confidently
looks
to
me
to
do
my
obvious
duty
at
once
the
doctor
laughed
as
if
you
were
always
doing
things
for
people
he
said
fondly
then
he
grew
suddenly
grave
the
dear
child
i
afraid
that
along
with
her
education
and
civilization
her
altruism
get
a
few
hard
knocks
but
she
get
over
that
too
you
see
at
heart
she
so
gentle
and
why
what
he
broke
off
with
an
unspoken
question
his
eyes
widely
opened
at
the
change
that
had
come
to
her
face
oh
nothing
returned
kendall
almost
despairingly
only
if
you
seen
joe
bagley
yesterday
morning
i
afraid
you
have
changed
your
opinion
of
her
gentleness
she
she
fought
him
kendall
stumbled
over
the
words
and
flushed
a
painful
red
as
she
spoke
them
fought
him
joe
bagley
gasped
the
doctor
why
he
almost
twice
her
size
yes
i
know
but
that
did
seem
to
occur
to
margaret
returned
kendall
she
saw
only
the
kitten
he
was
tormenting
and
well
she
rescued
the
kitten
and
then
administered
what
she
deemed
to
be
fit
punishment
there
and
then
when
i
arrived
on
the
scene
they
were
the
center
of
an
admiring
crowd
of
children
kendall
shivered
visibly
and
margaret
was
just
delivering
herself
of
a
final
blow
that
sent
the
great
bully
off
blubbering
good
for
her
it
was
an
involuntary
tribute
straight
from
the
heart
harry
gasped
kendall
a
delicate
girl
no
no
of
course
not
murmured
the
doctor
hastily
though
his
eyes
still
glowed
it
wo
do
of
course
but
you
must
remember
her
life
her
struggle
for
very
existence
all
those
years
she
to
train
her
fists
to
fight
her
way
i
i
suppose
so
admitted
kendall
faintly
but
she
shivered
again
as
if
with
a
sudden
chill
chapter
iii
scarcely
had
houghtonsville
recovered
from
its
first
shock
of
glad
surprise
at
margaret
safe
return
when
it
was
shaken
again
to
its
very
center
by
the
news
of
kendall
engagement
to
spencer
the
old
kendall
estate
had
been
for
more
than
a
generation
the
show
place
of
the
town
even
during
the
years
immediately
following
the
loss
of
little
margaret
when
the
great
stone
lions
on
each
side
of
the
steps
had
kept
guard
over
closed
doors
and
shuttered
windows
even
then
the
place
was
pointed
out
to
strangers
for
its
beauty
as
well
as
for
the
tragedy
that
had
so
recently
made
it
a
living
tomb
to
its
mistress
sometimes
though
not
often
a
glimpse
might
be
caught
of
a
slender
woman
and
always
there
could
be
seen
the
one
unshuttered
window
on
the
second
floor
every
one
knew
the
story
of
that
window
and
of
the
sunlit
room
beyond
where
lay
the
little
woolly
dog
just
as
the
baby
hands
had
dropped
it
there
years
before
and
every
one
knew
that
the
woman
widow
of
frank
kendall
and
mother
of
the
lost
little
girl
was
grieving
her
heart
out
in
the
great
lonely
house
not
until
the
last
two
years
of
margaret
absence
had
there
come
a
change
and
then
it
was
so
gradual
that
the
townspeople
scarcely
noticed
it
little
by
little
however
the
air
of
gloom
left
the
house
one
by
one
the
blinds
were
thrown
open
to
the
sunlight
and
more
and
more
frequently
kendall
was
seen
walking
in
the
garden
or
even
upon
the
street
not
until
the
news
of
the
engagement
had
come
however
did
houghtonsville
people
realize
the
doctor
part
in
all
this
then
they
understood
it
was
he
who
had
administered
to
her
diseased
body
and
still
more
diseased
mind
he
who
had
roused
her
from
her
apathy
of
despair
and
he
who
had
taught
her
that
the
world
was
full
of
other
griefs
even
as
bitter
as
her
own
not
hours
after
the
news
of
the
engagement
became
public
property
old
nathan
town
gossip
and
to
a
generation
of
physicians
spencer
included
observed
triumphantly
and
i
ai
a
mite
surprised
neither
it
a
good
thing
too
jest
suited
ter
each
other
ai
they
been
traipsin
all
over

tergether
an
ridin
whar

but
i
had
eyes
an
i
ai
a
fool
she
done
good
though
heaps
of
it
an
no
wonder
the
doctor
fell
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
an
thar
was
the
little
gal
too
did
he
go
twice
ter
new
york
fur

an
it
through
him
that
they
finally
got

that
told
kendall
that

little
city

get
a
breath
o
fresh

an
was
him
that

allers
him
thar
no
way
out
of
it
i
say
they
jest
had
ter
get
engaged
it
was
not
long
before
the
most
of
houghtonsville
in
sentiment
if
not
in
words
came
to
old
nathan
opinion
this
prospective
marriage
was
an
ideal
arrangement
after
all
and
not
in
the
least
surprising
there
remained
now
only
the
pleasant
task
of
making
the
wedding
a
joyful
affair
befitting
the
traditions
of
the
town
and
of
the
honored
name
of
kendall
in
all
houghtonsville
perhaps
there
was
only
one
heart
that
did
not
beat
in
sympathy
and
that
one
strangely
enough
belonged
to
kendall
own
daughter
margaret
you
mean
you
are
goin
to
marry
him
and
that
he
be
your
husband
for
for
keeps
margaret
demanded
with
some
agitation
when
her
mother
told
her
of
the
engagement
kendall
smiled
the
red
mounted
to
her
cheek
yes
dear
she
said
and
he
live
here
with
us
margaret
voice
was
growing
in
horror
why
yes
dear
murmured
kendall
then
quizzically
why
sweetheart
what
the
matter
do
you
like
spencer
it
was
only
last
week
that
you
were
begging
me
to
ask
some
one
here
to
live
with
us
margaret
frowned
anxiously
but
mother
dear
that
was
poor
folks
she
explained
her
eyes
troubled
spencer
ai
that
kind
you
know
you
you
said
he
be
a
husband
yes
and
and
husbands
mother
broke
off
the
little
girl
her
voice
sharp
with
anguished
love
and
terror
he
come
here
to
beat
you
and
bang
you
he
just
beat
me
gasped
kendall
margaret
what
in
the
world
are
you
thinking
of
to
say
such
a
thing
as
that
margaret
was
almost
crying
now
the
old
hunted
look
had
come
back
to
her
eyes
and
her
face
looked
suddenly
pinched
and
old
she
came
close
to
her
mother
side
and
caught
the
soft
folds
of
her
mother
dress
in
cold
shaking
fingers
but
they
do
do
it
all
of
she
warned
frenziedly
tim
sullivan
an
whalen
an
patty
father
they
was
all
husbands
every
one
of
and
there
was
one
of
but
what
beat
their
wives
and
banged
you
do
know
you
hai
seen
maybe
but
they
do
do
it
mother
they
do
do
it
for
a
moment
kendall
stared
speechlessly
into
the
face
before
her
then
she
caught
the
little
girl
in
her
arms
you
poor
little
dear
she
choked
you
poor
forlorn
little
bunch
of
misguided
pessimism
come
let
me
tell
you
how
really
good
and
kind
and
gentle
the
doctor
is
beat
me
indeed
oh
margaret
margaret
chapter
iv
in
spite
of
kendall
earnest
efforts
margaret
was
not
easily
convinced
that
marriage
might
be
desirable
and
that
all
husbands
were
not
patterned
after
tim
sullivan
and
mike
whalen
nor
was
this
coming
marriage
the
only
thing
that
troubled
margaret
life
at
the
alley
was
still
too
vividly
before
her
eyes
to
allow
her
to
understand
any
scheme
of
living
that
did
not
recognize
the
supremacy
of
the
sharpest
tongue
and
the
heaviest
fist
and
this
period
of
adjustment
to
the
new
order
of
things
was
not
without
its
trials
for
herself
as
well
as
for
her
mother
the
beauty
love
and
watchful
care
that
surrounded
her
filled
her
with
ecstatic
rapture
but
the
niceties
of
speech
and
manner
daily
demanded
of
her
terrified
and
dismayed
her
why
bully
and
should
be
frowned
upon
when
after
all
they
but
expressed
her
pleasure
in
something
provided
for
her
happiness
she
could
not
understand
and
why
the
handling
of
the
absurdly
large
number
of
knives
forks
and
spoons
about
her
plate
at
dinner
should
be
a
matter
of
so
great
moment
she
could
not
see
as
for
the
big
white
square
of
folded
cloth
that
her
mother
thought
so
necessary
at
every
meal
its
dainty
purity
filled
margaret
with
dismay
lest
she
soil
or
wrinkle
it
and
for
her
part
she
would
have
much
preferred
to
let
it
quite
alone
there
were
the
callers
too
beautiful
ladies
in
trailing
gowns
who
insisted
upon
seeing
her
though
why
margaret
could
not
understand
for
they
invariably
cried
and
said
poor
little
lamb
when
they
did
see
her
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
convince
them
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
and
there
were
the
children
they
too
were
disconcerting
they
came
sometimes
alone
and
sometimes
with
their
parents
but
always
they
stared
and
seemed
afraid
of
her
there
were
others
to
be
sure
who
were
not
afraid
of
her
but
they
never
called
they
slipped
in
through
the
back
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
they
were
really
very
nice
they
were
nat
and
tom
and
roxy
trotter
and
they
lived
in
a
little
house
down
by
the
river
they
never
wore
shoes
nor
stockings
and
their
clothes
were
not
at
all
like
those
of
the
other
children
margaret
suspected
that
the
trotters
were
poor
and
she
took
pains
that
her
mother
should
see
nat
and
tom
and
roxy
her
mother
however
did
not
appear
to
know
them
which
did
not
seem
so
very
strange
to
margaret
after
all
for
of
course
her
mother
had
not
known
there
were
any
poor
people
so
near
otherwise
she
would
have
shared
her
home
with
them
long
ago
at
first
it
was
margaret
plan
to
rectify
this
little
mistake
immediately
but
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
thoroughly
was
she
convinced
that
the
first
chance
belonged
by
right
to
patty
family
and
the
whalens
in
new
york
inasmuch
as
they
had
been
so
good
to
her
she
determined
therefore
to
wait
awhile
before
suggesting
the
removal
of
the
trotter
family
from
their
tiny
inconvenient
house
to
the
more
spacious
and
desirable
five
oaks
delightful
as
were
the
trotters
however
even
they
did
not
quite
come
up
to
bobby
mcginnis
for
real
comradeship
bobby
lived
with
his
mother
and
grandmother
in
the
little
red
farmhouse
farther
up
the
hill
it
was
he
who
had
found
margaret
crying
in
the
streets
on
that
first
dreadful
day
long
ago
when
she
was
lost
in
new
york
for
a
week
she
had
lived
in
his
attic
home
then
she
had
become
frightened
at
his
father
drunken
rage
one
day
and
had
fled
to
the
streets
never
to
return
all
this
margaret
knew
though
she
had
but
a
faint
recollection
of
it
it
made
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
nevertheless
and
caused
them
to
become
fast
friends
at
once
it
was
to
bobby
that
she
went
for
advice
when
the
standards
of
houghtonsville
and
the
alley
clashed
and
it
was
to
bobby
that
she
went
for
sympathy
when
grievous
mismanagement
of
the
knives
and
forks
or
of
the
folded
square
of
cloth
brought
disaster
to
herself
and
tears
to
her
mother
eyes
she
earnestly
desired
to
as
she
expressed
it
to
bobby
come
up
to
the
scratch
and
walk
straight
and
it
was
to
bobby
that
she
looked
for
aid
and
counsel
you
see
you
can
tell
just
what
is
ails
me
she
argued
earnestly
as
the
two
sat
in
their
favorite
perch
in
the
apple
tree
you
do
know
patty
and
the
whalens
but
you
do
know
folks
just
like
and
mother
do
you
see
she
knows
only
the
kind
that
lives
here
and
she
she
do
understand
but
you
know
both
kinds
and
you
can
tell
where
is
that
i
ai
like
here
and
i
want
to
be
like
bobby
i
do
truly
they
just
i
mean
folks
she
corrected
hastily
and
mother
so
good
to
me
she
just
margaret
stopped
suddenly
a
new
thought
seemed
to
have
come
to
her
bobby
she
cried
with
sharp
abruptness
did
you
ever
know
any
husbands
that
was
good
what
do
ye
mean
did
you
ever
know
any
that
was
good
i
mean
that
did
beat
their
wives
and
bang
did
you
bobby
bobby
laughed
he
lifted
his
chin
quizzically
and
gazed
down
from
the
lofty
superiority
of
his
fourteen
years
sure
an
ai
ye
beginnin
sort
o
early
ter
worry
about
husbands
he
teased
but
mebbe
you
already
er
picked
him
out
eh
margaret
did
not
seem
to
hear
she
was
looking
straight
through
a
little
open
space
in
the
boughs
of
the
apple
tree
to
the
blue
sky
far
beyond
bobby
she
began
in
a
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper
if
that
man
should
be
bad
to
my
mother
i
think
i
kill
him
bobby
roused
himself
he
suddenly
remembered
joe
bagley
and
the
kitten
what
man
he
asked
dr
spencer
dr
spencer
gasped
bobby
why
spencer
would
hurt
a
fly
just
bully
margaret
stirred
restlessly
she
turned
a
grave
face
on
her
companion
bobby
she
reproved
gently
i
do
think
i
oughter
hear
them
words
if
i
ai
to
use
myself
bobby
uptilted
his
chin
i
heard
your
ma
say
proper
he
observed
virtuously
i
should
have
mentioned
it
only
well
seein
as
how
you
so
awful
particular
for
the
more
telling
effect
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
again
margaret
did
not
seem
to
hear
again
her
eyes
had
sought
the
patch
of
blue
showing
through
the
green
leaves
spencer
may
be
nice
now
but
he
ai
a
husband
yet
she
said
thoughtfully
there
was
tim
sullivan
and
patty
father
and
mike
whalen
she
enumerated
aloud
and
they
was
all
bobby
was
your
father
a
good
husband
she
demanded
with
a
sudden
turn
that
brought
her
eyes
squarely
round
to
his
the
boy
was
silent
bobby
was
he
slowly
the
boy
eyes
fell
well
of
course
sometimes
dad
would
he
began
but
margaret
interrupted
him
i
knew
it
i
just
knew
it
i
just
knew
there
was
any
she
moaned
but
i
ca
make
mother
see
it
i
just
ca
this
was
but
the
first
of
many
talks
between
margaret
and
bobby
upon
the
same
subject
and
always
margaret
was
seeking
for
a
possible
averting
of
the
catastrophe
to
convince
her
mother
of
the
awfulness
of
the
fate
awaiting
her
and
so
to
persuade
her
to
abandon
the
idea
of
marriage
was
out
of
the
question
margaret
soon
found
it
was
then
perhaps
that
the
idea
of
speaking
to
the
doctor
himself
first
came
to
her
if
i
could
only
get
him
to
promise
things
she
said
to
bobby
if
i
could
only
get
him
to
promise
promise
yes
to
be
good
and
kind
you
know
nodded
margaret
and
not
like
a
husband
bobby
laughed
then
he
frowned
and
was
silent
suddenly
his
face
changed
i
say
you
might
make
him
sign
a
contract
he
hazarded
contract
sure
one
of
them
things
that
makes
folks
toe
the
mark
whether
they
wants
to
or
not
i
draw
it
up
for
you
that
what
they
call
it
he
explained
airily
and
as
margaret
bubbled
over
with
delight
and
thanks
he
added
not
at
all
nothin
glad
ter
do
it
i
sure
for
a
month
now
bobby
had
swept
the
floor
and
dusted
the
books
in
the
law
office
of
burt
burt
to
say
nothing
of
running
errands
and
tending
door
in
days
gone
by
the
law
as
represented
by
the
policeman
on
the
corner
was
something
to
be
avoided
but
as
represented
by
a
frock
coat
a
tall
hat
and
a
vocabulary
bristling
with
big
words
it
was
something
that
was
most
alluring
so
alluring
in
fact
that
bobby
had
determined
to
adopt
it
as
his
own
he
himself
would
be
a
lawyer
tall
hat
frock
coat
big
words
and
all
hence
his
readiness
to
undertake
this
little
matter
of
drawing
up
a
contract
for
margaret
his
first
client
it
was
some
days
nevertheless
before
the
work
was
ready
for
the
doctor
signature
the
young
lawyer
unfortunately
could
not
give
all
of
his
time
to
his
own
affairs
there
were
still
the
trivial
duties
of
his
office
to
perform
he
found
too
that
the
big
words
which
fell
so
glibly
from
the
lips
of
the
great
burt
burt
were
anything
but
easily
managed
when
he
tried
to
put
them
upon
paper
himself
bobby
was
ambitious
and
persistent
however
and
where
knowledge
failed
imagination
stepped
boldly
to
the
front
in
the
end
it
was
with
no
little
pride
that
he
displayed
the
result
of
his
labor
to
his
client
then
with
her
gleeful
words
of
approval
still
ringing
in
his
ears
he
slipped
it
into
its
envelope
sealed
stamped
and
posted
it
thus
it
happened
that
the
next
day
a
very
much
amazed
physician
received
this
in
his
mail
to
whom
it
may
whereas
i
the
undersigned
being
in
my
sane
mind
do
intend
to
commit
matremony
i
the
said
undersigned
do
hereby
solumly
declare
and
agree
to
wit
not
to
beat
my
aforesaid
wife
not
to
bang
her
round
not
to
falsely
wickedly
and
maliciously
treat
her
not
once
moreover
i
the
said
undersigned
do
solumly
swear
all
this
to
margaret
kendall
the
dorter
and
lawfull
protectur
of

and
whereas
if
i
the

concerning

i
do

that

may
bestow
upon

such
punishmunt
as
seems
eminuntly
proper
to

at
such
time
as
she
sees
fit
whereas
and
whereunto
i
have
this
day
set
my
hand
and
seal
here
followed
a
space
for
the
signature
and
a
somewhat
thumbed
irregular
daub
of
red
chapter
v
it
was
a
particularly
warm
july
evening
but
a
faint
breeze
from
the
west
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
crimson
rambler
that
climbed
over
the
front
veranda
at
five
oaks
and
brought
the
first
relief
from
the
scorching
heat
the
great
stone
lions
loomed
out
of
the
shadows
and
caught
the
moonlight
full
on
their
shaggy
heads
to
the
doctor
sitting
alone
on
the
veranda
steps
they
seemed
almost
alive
and
he
smiled
at
the
thought
that
came
to
him
so
you
think
you
too
are
guarding
her
he
chuckled
quietly
pray
and
are
you
also
her
protectur
a
light
step
sounded
on
the
floor
behind
him
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
she
asleep
said
kendall
softly
she
dropped
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
she
touched
the
pillow
dear
child
yes
children
are
apt
amy
dearest
broke
off
the
doctor
sharply
you
are
crying
no
no
it
is
nothing
assured
kendall
as
the
doctor
led
her
to
a
chair
it
is
always
this
way
only
it
was
a
a
little
more
than
usual
this
way
why
amy
kendall
smiled
then
raised
her
hand
to
brush
away
a
tear
you
do
understand
she
murmured
it
the
bedtime
prayer
margaret
then
at
the
doctor
amazed
frown
she
added
the
dear
child
goes
over
her
whole
day
bit
by
bit
and
asks
forgiveness
for
countless
misdemeanors
and
it
nearly
breaks
my
heart
for
it
shows
how
many
times
i
have
said
to
the
poor
little
thing
since
morning
and
as
if
that
were
not
piteous
enough
she
must
needs
ask
the
dear
father
to
tell
her
how
to
handle
her
fork
and
how
to
sit
walk
and
talk
so
to
please
mother
harry
what
i
do
but
you
are
doing
returned
the
doctor
you
are
loving
her
and
you
are
surrounding
her
with
everything
good
and
beautiful
but
i
want
to
do
right
myself
just
right
and
you
are
doing
just
right
dear
but
the
results
they
are
so
irregular
and
uneven
sighed
the
mother
despairingly
one
minute
she
is
the
gentle
loving
little
girl
i
held
in
my
arms
five
years
ago
and
the
next
she
is
well
she
is
margaret
at
all
no
smiled
the
doctor
she
is
margaret
at
all
she
is
mag
of
the
alley
dependent
on
her
wits
and
her
fists
for
life
itself
do
worry
sweetheart
it
will
all
come
right
in
time
it
ca
help
it
but
it
will
take
the
time
she
tries
so
hard
the
little
precious
and
she
does
love
me
a
curious
smile
curved
the
doctor
lips
she
does
he
said
dryly
why
harry
what
kendall
eyes
were
questioning
the
doctor
hesitated
then
very
slowly
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
large
somewhat
document
i
hardly
know
whether
to
share
this
with
you
or
not
he
began
still
it
too
good
to
keep
to
myself
and
it
concerns
you
intimately
moreover
you
may
be
able
to
assist
me
with
some
advice
in
the
matter
or
at
least
with
some
possible
explanation
and
he
held
out
the
paper
kendall
turned
in
her
chair
so
that
the
light
from
the
open
would
fall
upon
the
round
cramped
handwriting
whom
it
may
concern
she
read
aloud
i
the
undersigned
being
in
my
sane
mind
do
intend
to
commit
matremony
why
harry
what
in
the
world
is
this
she
demanded
go
on
read
returned
the
doctor
with
a
nonchalant
wave
of
his
hand
and
kendall
dropped
her
eyes
again
to
the
paper
harry
what
in
the
world
does
this
mean
she
gasped
a
minute
later
as
she
finished
reading
half
laughing
half
crying
and
wholly
amazed
but
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
parried
the
doctor
you
do
mean
that
margaret
wrote
but
she
could
besides
it
her
writing
no
margaret
did
write
it
for
that
part
i
think
i
detect
the
earmarks
of
young
mcginnis
at
all
events
it
came
from
him
bobby
yes
but
who
kendall
stopped
abruptly
a
dawning
comprehension
came
into
her
eyes
you
mean
harry
she
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
remember
now
it
was
only
a
week
or
two
ago
that
she
used
those
same
words
to
me
she
insisted
that
you
would
beat
me
and
and
bang
me
oh
margaret
margaret
my
poor
little
girl
the
doctor
smiled
then
he
shook
his
head
gravely
poor
child
she
has
seen
much
of
conjugal
felicity
has
she
he
murmured
then
softly
it
is
left
for
us
sweetheart
to
teach
her
that
the
color
deepened
in
kendall
cheeks
her
eyes
softened
then
danced
merrily
but
you
have
signed
this
sir
yet
she
challenged
laughingly
as
she
held
out
the
paper
he
caught
both
paper
and
hands
in
a
warm
clasp
but
i
will
he
declared
wait
and
see
not
twenty
hours
later
bobby
mcginnis
halted
at
the
great
gate
of
the
driveway
at
five
oaks
and
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
almost
instantly
margaret
flew
across
the
lawn
to
meet
him
oh
it
jest
a
little
matter
of
business
greeted
bobby
with
careless
ease
i
got
that
document
here
all
signed
i
reckoned
the
doctor
would
lose
no
time
makin
sure
ter
do
his
part
bobby
not
the
contract
so
soon
exulted
margaret
sure
why
not
i
told
him
ter
please
sign
to
once
an
return
an
he
did
i
reckoned
he
meant
business
in
this
little
matter
an
he
reckoned
i
did
too
there
nothin
for
him
ter
do
but
sign
margaret
drew
her
brows
together
in
a
thoughtful
frown
but
he
might
have
refused
she
suggested
bobby
gave
her
a
scornful
glance
refused
an
lost
the
chance
of
marryin
at
all
not
much
he
asserted
with
emphasis
well
anyhow
i
glad
he
did
sighed
margaret
as
she
clutched
the
precious
paper
close
to
her
heart
i
should
hated
to
have
refused
outright
to
let
him
marry
her
when
mother
bobby
mother
actually
seems
to
to
have
him
chapter
vi
margaret
had
been
at
home
four
weeks
when
the
invitation
for
patty
arabella
clarabella
and
three
of
the
whalens
to
visit
her
finally
left
her
mother
hands
there
had
not
been
a
day
of
all
those
four
weeks
that
margaret
had
not
talked
of
the
coming
visit
at
first
to
be
sure
she
had
not
called
it
a
visit
she
had
referred
to
it
as
the
time
when
patty
and
the
whalens
come
here
to
live
gradually
however
her
mother
had
persuaded
her
to
let
them
try
it
and
see
how
they
liked
it
and
to
this
compromise
margaret
finally
gave
a
somewhat
reluctant
consent
kendall
herself
was
distinctly
uneasy
over
the
whole
affair
and
on
one
pretext
and
another
had
put
off
sending
for
the
proposed
guests
until
margaret
importunities
left
her
no
choice
in
the
matter
not
but
that
she
was
grateful
to
the
two
families
that
had
been
so
good
to
margaret
in
her
hour
of
need
but
she
would
have
preferred
to
show
that
gratitude
in
some
way
not
quite
so
intimate
as
taking
them
into
her
house
and
home
for
an
indefinite
period
margaret
however
was
still
intent
on
divvying
up
and
kendall
could
not
look
into
her
daughter
clear
blue
eyes
and
explain
why
patty
arabella
clarabella
and
the
whalens
might
not
be
the
most
desirable
guests
in
the
world
it
had
been
margaret
intention
to
invite
all
of
the
whalen
family
she
had
hesitated
a
little
it
is
true
over
mike
whalen
the
father
you
see
he
drinks
and
when
he
ai
asleep
he
cross
mostly
she
explained
to
her
mother
but
we
ca
leave
just
him
behind
so
have
to
ask
him
besides
if
he
goin
to
live
here
why
he
might
as
well
come
right
now
at
the
first
no
certainly
we
could
leave
whalen
behind
alone
kendall
had
returned
with
dry
lips
so
suppose
we
do
take
any
of
the
whalens
this
time
just
devote
ourselves
to
patty
and
the
twins
to
this
however
margaret
refused
to
give
her
consent
what
not
take
any
of
the
whalens
the
whalens
who
had
been
so
good
as
to
give
them
one
whole
corner
of
their
kitchen
rent
free
certainly
not
she
agreed
however
after
considerable
discussion
to
take
only
tom
mary
and
peter
of
the
whalen
family
leaving
the
rest
of
the
children
and
whalen
to
keep
old
mike
whalen
company
for
after
all
as
she
said
to
her
mother
if
tom
and
mary
and
peter
like
it
here
the
rest
will
they
always
like
what
tom
does
he
makes
kendall
never
thought
of
that
speech
afterward
without
a
shudder
she
even
dreamed
once
of
this
tom
he
stood
over
her
with
clinched
fists
and
flashing
eyes
demanding
that
she
divvy
up
to
the
last
cent
clearly
as
she
understood
that
this
was
only
a
dream
yet
the
vision
haunted
her
and
it
was
not
without
some
apprehension
that
she
went
with
margaret
to
the
station
to
meet
her
guests
on
the
day
appointed
a
letter
from
margaret
had
gone
to
patty
and
one
from
kendall
to
miss
murdock
the
city
missionary
who
had
been
so
good
to
margaret
houghtonsville
was
on
a
main
line
to
new
york
and
but
a
few
hours
ride
from
the
city
kendall
had
given
full
instructions
as
to
trains
and
had
sent
the
money
for
the
six
tickets
she
had
also
asked
miss
murdock
to
place
the
children
in
care
of
the
conductor
saying
that
she
would
meet
them
herself
at
the
houghtonsville
station
promptly
in
return
had
come
miss
murdock
letter
telling
of
the
children
delighted
acceptance
of
the
invitation
and
almost
immediately
had
followed
patty
elaborately
flourished
scrawl
much
obliged
for
de
invite
an
wes
acomin
tanks
clarabella
arabella
an
patty
at
yer
service
kendall
thought
of
this
letter
and
of
tom
as
she
stood
waiting
for
the
long
train
from
new
york
to
come
to
a
standstill
then
she
looked
down
at
the
little
maid
at
her
side
and
shuddered
it
is
one
thing
to
carry
and
to
our
unfortunate
fellow
men
and
quite
another
to
invite
those
same
fellow
men
to
a
seat
at
our
own
table
or
by
our
own
fireside
margaret
and
her
mother
had
not
long
to
wait
tom
whalen
in
spite
of
the
conductor
restraining
hand
was
on
the
platform
before
the
wheels
had
ceased
to
turn
behind
him
tumbled
peter
mary
and
clarabella
while
patty
carefully
guiding
arabella
twisted
feet
brought
up
the
rear
there
was
an
instant
pause
then
tom
spied
margaret
and
with
a
triumphant
come
on
here
she
is
to
those
behind
he
dashed
down
the
platform
my
but
ai
you
slick
he
cried
admiringly
stopping
short
before
margaret
who
had
unconsciously
shrunk
close
to
her
mother
side
hi
thar
patty
he
called
hailing
the
gleeful
children
behind
him
what
would
the
alley
say
if
they
could
see
her
now
there
was
a
moment
pause
eagerly
as
the
children
had
followed
lead
they
stood
abashed
now
before
the
tall
beautiful
woman
and
the
pretty
little
girl
they
had
once
known
as
mag
of
the
alley
almost
instantly
margaret
saw
and
understood
and
with
all
the
strength
of
her
hospitable
little
soul
she
strove
to
put
her
guests
at
their
ease
with
a
glad
little
cry
she
gave
one
after
another
a
hug
then
she
stood
back
with
a
flourish
and
prepared
for
the
introductions
unconsciously
her
words
and
manner
aped
those
of
her
mother
in
sundry
other
introductions
that
had
figured
in
her
own
experience
during
the
last
four
weeks
and
before
kendall
knew
what
was
happening
she
found
herself
being
ceremoniously
presented
to
tom
whalen
late
of
the
alley
new
york
tom
this
is
my
dear
mother
that
i
lost
long

freckles

through

glow
proud
ter

he
stammered
clutching
frantically
at
the
outstretched
hand
margaret
sighed
with
relief
tom
did
know
how
to
behave
after
all
she
had
feared
he
would
not
and
this
is
mary
whalen
and

limp
hands
belonging
to
a
girl
and
a
frightened
boy
and
here
patty
and
the
twins
clarabella
and
arabella
and
now

margaret
beaming
joyously
upon
her
mother
who
was
leaning
with
tender
eyes
over
the
little
lame
arabella
my

poor
little

patty
giving

kendall
hurriedly
she
told
me
that
the
little
girl
was
lame

my
dears
we

go
home
kendall
hesitated
and
looked
about
her
you
you
have
any
bags
or
or
anything
she
asked
them
gee
cried
tom
turning
sharply
toward
the
track
where
had
stood
a
moment
before
the
train
that
brought
them
an
if
gone
so
soon
gone
the
bag
chorused
five
shrill
voices
sure
nodded
tom
then
with
a
resigned
air
he
thrust
both
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
gone
she
is
bag
and
baggage
oh

so
sorry
murmured
kendall
pooh
a
mite
o

assured
patty
quickly
ye
see
dar
nothin
in
it
anyhow
only
a
extry
fur
arabella
hair
then
at
kendall
blank
look
of
amazement
she
explained
we
only
took
it
katy
sovrensky
said
folks
allers
took
when
they
went
so
we
fished
dis
out
o
de
ash
barrel
an
fixed
it
up
wid
strings
an
tacks
we
did
have
nothin
ter
put
in
it
all
our
clo
is
on
us
we
did
need
nothin
else
anyhow
piped
up
arabella
for
all
our
things
is
span
clean
we
went
ter
bed
all
day
yisterday
so
patty
could
wash
yes
yes
of
course
certainly
agreed
kendall
faintly
as
she
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
big
carryall
waiting
for
them
then
we
go
home
right
away
to
tom
peter
mary
patty
arabella
and
clarabella
it
was
all
so
wonderful
that
they
fairly
pinched
themselves
to
make
sure
they
were
awake
the
drive
through
the
streets
with
everywhere
flowers
houses
and
velvety
lawns
it
was
all
quite
unbelievable
it
more
like
than
anythin
i
ever
see
murmured
arabella
seems
as
though
was
heaven
and
kendall
who
heard
the
words
reproached
herself
because
for
four
long
weeks
she
had
stood
jealous
guard
over
this
heaven
and
refused
to
divvy
up
its
enjoyment
the
next
moment
she
shuddered
and
unconsciously
drew
margaret
close
to
her
side
patty
had
said
gee
whiz
mag
ai
you
lucky
i
was
a
lost
an
founded
the
house
with
its
great
stone
lions
was
hailed
with
an
awed
of
delight
as
were
the
wide
lawns
and
brilliant
inside
the
house
the
children
blinked
in
amazement
at
the
windows
and
pictures
and
clarabella
balancing
herself
on
her
toes
looked
fearfully
at
the
woven
pinks
and
roses
at
her
feet
and
demanded
do
walkin
on
hurt
seems
so
she
added
her
eyes
distrustfully
bent
on
margaret
who
had
laughed
and
by
way
of
proving
the
carpet
durability
was
dancing
up
and
down
upon
it
the
matter
of
choosing
beds
in
the
wide
airy
chambers
was
a
momentous
one
in
the
boys
room
to
be
sure
it
was
a
simple
matter
for
there
were
only
two
beds
and
tom
settled
the
question
at
once
by
unceremoniously
throwing
peter
on
to
one
of
them
and
pommeling
him
with
the
pillow
until
he
howled
for
mercy
the
girls
had
two
rooms
opening
out
of
each
other
and
in
each
room
were
two
dainty
white
beds
here
the
matter
of
choosing
was
only
settled
amicably
at
last
by
a
rigid
system
of
counting
out
by
eeny
meany
miny
mo
and
even
this
was
not
accomplished
without
much
shouting
and
laughter
and
not
a
few
angry
words
margaret
was
distressed
for
a
time
she
was
silent
then
she
threw
herself
into
the
discussion
with
all
the
ardor
of
one
who
would
bring
peace
at
any
cost
and
it
was
by
her
suggestion
that
the
eeny
meany
miny
mo
finally
won
the
day
in
her
own
room
that
night
as
she
went
to
bed
she
apologized
to
her
mother
i
sorry
they
was
so
rude
mother
i
had
forgot
they
was
quite
so
noisy
she
confessed
anxiously
but
i
tell
to
be
more
quiet
maybe
they
did
know
that
little
ladies
and
little
gentlemen
do
act
like
that
chapter
vii
five
oaks
awoke
to
a
new
existence
on
the
first
morning
after
the
arrival
of
its
guests
from
new
york
an
existence
of
wild
shouts
gleeful
laughter
scampering
feet
and
confusion
in
the
kitchen
and
the
garden
old
and
barrett
no
longer
held
full
sway
for
some
time
there
had
been
a
cook
a
waitress
a
laundress
and
an
experienced
gardener
as
well
in
the
barn
too
there
was
now
a
stalwart
fellow
who
was
coachman
and
chauffeur
by
turns
according
to
whether
the
old
family
carriage
or
the
new
touring
car
was
wanted
tom
peter
mary
patty
and
the
twins
had
not
been
at
five
oaks
hours
before
they
were
fitted
to
new
clothing
throughout
kendall
had
not
slept
until
she
had
interviewed
the
town
clothier
as
to
ways
and
means
of
immediately
providing
two
boys
and
four
girls
with
shoes
stockings
hats
coats
trousers
dresses
and
undergarments
necessary
patty
had
said
upon
being
presented
with
her
share
of
the
new
garments
but
it
awful
nice
now
we
do
have
ter
go
ter
bed
when
ours
is
washed
an
they
be
awful
nice
just
no
wonder
five
oaks
awoke
to
a
new
existence
the
lawns
knew
now
what
it
was
to
be
pressed
by
a
dozen
little
scampering
feet
at
once
and
the
great
stone
lions
knew
what
it
was
to
have
two
yelling
boys
mount
their
carven
backs
and
try
to
dig
sharp
little
heels
into
their
stone
sides
within
the
house
the
attic
sacred
for
years
to
cobwebs
and
musty
memories
knew
what
it
was
to
yield
its
treasured
bonnets
shawls
and
quilted
skirts
to
a
swarm
of
noisy
children
who
demanded
them
for
charades
tom
peter
mary
patty
arabella
and
clarabella
had
been
at
five
oaks
two
weeks
when
one
day
bobby
mcginnis
found
margaret
crying
all
alone
in
the
old
summerhouse
down
in
the
garden
gorry
what
up
he
questioned
adding
cheerily
daughters
do
cry
it
was
a
quotation
from
margaret
own
childhood
creed
and
one
which
in
the
old
days
seldom
failed
to
dry
her
tears
even
now
it
was
not
without
its
effect
for
her
head
came
up
with
a
jerk
i
i
know
it
she
sobbed
and
i
ai
i
mean
i
not
going
to
there
you
see
she
broke
off
miserably
falling
back
into
her
old
despondent
attitude
should
be
not
always
and
i
never
can
remember
pooh
is
that
all
laughed
bobby
take
a
not
ter
make
me
cry
but
that
ai
all
wailed
margaret
and
she
did
not
notice
that
at
one
of
her
words
bobby
chuckled
and
parted
his
lips
only
to
close
them
again
with
a
snap
there
heaps
more
of
and
and
and
and
on
the
ends
of
things
and
well
almost
everything
i
say
seems
so
well
what
of
it
you
get
over
it
you
all
the
time
ai
ye
not
you
bobby
sighed
margaret
well
not
you
then
snapped
bobby
margaret
shook
her
head
a
look
that
was
almost
terror
came
to
her
eyes
she
leaned
forward
and
clutched
the
boy
arm
bobby
that
just
it
she
whispered
looking
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
no
one
heard
that
just
it
i
not
why
not
because
of
them
tom
and
patty
and
the
rest
bobby
looked
dazed
and
margaret
plunged
headlong
into
her
explanation
it
them
they
do
all
of
do
you
see
they
say
and
and
all
the
time
and
i
see
now
how
bad
is
and
i
want
to
stop
but
i
ca

bobby
i
just
ca
i
try
to
but
it
just
comes
before
i
know
it
i
tried
to
stop
them
sayin
first
went
on
margaret
feverishly
just
as
i
tried
to
make
act
ladylike
with
their
feet
and
their
knives
and
forks
but
it
did
do
a
mite
o
good
first
they
laughed
at
me
then
they
got
mad
you
know
how
was
bobby
you
saw
bobby
whistled
yes
i
know
he
said
soberly
but
when
they
go
away
that
just
it
cut
in
margaret
tragically
i
goin
to
have
them
go
away
i
was
goin
to
keep
always
and
now
i
bobby
i
them
to
go
she
paused
and
let
the
full
enormity
of
her
confession
sink
into
her
hearer
comprehension
then
she
repeated
i
want
them
to
go
well
what
of
it
retorted
bobby
with
airy
unconcern
what
of
it
wept
margaret
why
bobby
do
you
see
i
was
goin
to
divvy
up
and
i
ought
to
divvy
up
too
i
got
trees
and
grass
and
flowers
and
beds
with
sheets
on
and
enough
to

anything
and
now
i
do
want
to
divvy
up
i
want
to
divvy
up
because
i
do
want
them
here
margaret
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
bobby
was
silent
his
hands
were
in
his
pocket
and
his
eyes
were
on
an
ant
struggling
with
a
burden
almost
as
large
as
itself
do
you
see
bobby
it
wicked
that
i
am
awful
wicked
resumed
margaret
after
a
minute
i
want
to
be
nice
and
gentle
like
mother
wants
me
to
be
i
do
want
to
be
mag
of
the
alley
i
i

just
like
them
bobby
i
know
i
shall
and
and
so
i
do
want
to

bobby
stirred
uneasily
changing
his
position
well
you
you
hai
asked
to
yet
have
ye
he
questioned
no
mother
that
i
should
say
anything
about
their
stayin
always
till
their
visit
was
over
and
they
saw
how
they
liked
things
shucks
rejoined
bobby
his
face
clearing
then
what
ye
cryin
you
ai
bound
by
no
contract
you
do
have
ter
divvy
up
but
i
ought
to
divvy
up
pooh
ye
had
scoffed
bobby
hai
folks
got
a
right
ter
have
their
own
things
margaret
frowned
doubtfully
i
do
know
she
began
with
some
hesitation
if
i
got
nice
things
and
more
of
than
patty
has
why
should
she
have
some
of
mine
fair
somehow
somebody
ai
playin
straight
i
i
goin
to
ask
mother
and
she
turned
slowly
away
and
began
to
walk
toward
the
house
not
once
but
many
times
during
the
next
few
days
did
margaret
talk
with
her
mother
on
this
subject
that
so
troubled
her
the
result
of
these
conferences
bobby
learned
not
five
days
later
when
margaret
ran
down
to
meet
him
at
the
great
driveway
gate
back
on
the
veranda
patty
and
the
others
were
playing
housekeeping
and
margaret
spoke
low
so
that
they
might
not
hear
i
goin
to
divvy
up
she
announced
in
triumph
but
not
here
huh
frowned
bobby
i
goin
to
divvy
up
give
some
of
my
things
you
know
explained
margaret
then
when
they
go
back
mother
goin
with
and
find
a
better
place
for
to
live
in
oh
then
they
are
back
eh
margaret
flushed
a
little
and
threw
a
questioning
look
into
face
there
seemed
to
be
a
laugh
in
bobby
voice
though
there
was
none
on
his
lips
yes
she
nodded
hurriedly
you
see
mother
thinks
it
best
she
says
that
they
had
ought
to
be
here
now
with
me
that
it
my
period
and
that
everything
about
me
ought
to
be
just
right
so
as
to
form
me
right
see
yes
i
see
said
bobby
so
crossly
that
margaret
opened
her
eyes
in
wonder
why
bobby
you
do
care
they
goin
away
do
you
do
i
he
growled
humph
i
be
me
next
that
be
sent
flyin
you
why
you
live
here
well
i
say
an
do
i
he
retorted
aggressively
margaret
stepped
back
her
face
changed
why
so
you
do
she
breathed
and
i
never
once
thought
of
it
bobby
said
nothing
he
was
standing
on
one
foot
digging
the
toe
of
the
other
into
the
graveled
driveway
for
a
time
margaret
regarded
him
with
troubled
eyes
then
she
sighed
well
anyhow
you
do
live
here
all
the
time
right
in
the
house
same
patty
and
the
rest
would
if
they
stayed
i
i
do
want
to
give
up
bobby
bobby
flushed
red
under
the
tan
his
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
but
his
chin
went
up
and
his
hands
executed
the
careless
flourish
that
a
boy
of
fourteen
is
apt
to
use
when
he
wishes
to
hide
the
fact
that
his
heart
is
touched
illustration
for
a
time
margaret
regarded
him
with
troubled
eyes
do
trouble
yerself
he
shrugged
airily
it
do
make
a
mite
ter
me
ye
know
there
plenty
i
be
with
and
he
turned
and
hurried
up
the
road
with
long
strides
sending
back
over
his
shoulder
a
particularly
joyous
whistle
a
whistle
that
broke
and
wheezed
into
silence
however
the
minute
that
the
woods
at
the
turn
of
the
road
were
reached
i
do
care
he
blustered
glaring
at
the
chipmunk
that
eyed
him
from
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
bully
gee
ai
hai
there
then
having
demonstrated
his
right
to
whatever
vocabulary
he
chose
to
employ
he
went
home
to
the
little
red
farmhouse
on
the
hill
and
spent
an
hour
hunting
for
a
certain
book
of
his
mother
in
the
attic
when
he
had
found
it
he
spent
another
hour
poring
over
its
contents
the
book
was
old
and
yellow
and
and
bore
on
the
faded
pasteboard
cover
the
words
a
work
on
english
grammar
and
composition
chapter
viii
tom
peter
mary
patty
and
the
twins
stayed
at
five
oaks
until
the
first
of
september
then
plump
brown
and
happy
they
returned
to
new
york
with
them
went
several
articles
of
use
and
beauty
which
had
hitherto
belonged
to
five
oaks
kendall
greatly
relieved
at
margaret
somewhat
surprising
willingness
to
let
the
visitors
go
had
finally
consented
to
margaret
proposition
that
the
children
be
allowed
to
select
something
they
specially
liked
to
take
back
with
them
in
giving
this
consent
kendall
had
made
only
such
reservation
as
would
insure
that
certain
valuable
and
not
easily
duplicated
treasures
of
her
own
should
remain
undisturbed
she
smiled
afterward
at
her
fears
tom
selected
an
old
bugle
from
the
attic
and
peter
a
scabbard
that
had
lost
its
sword
mary
chose
a
string
of
blue
beads
that
margaret
sometimes
wore
and
clarabella
a
pink
sash
that
she
found
in
a
trunk
patty
before
telling
her
choice
asked
timidly
what
would
happen
if
it
was
too
big
ter
be
tooked
in
yer
hands
upon
being
assured
that
it
would
be
sent
if
it
could
not
be
carried
she
unhesitatingly
chose
the
biggest
the
house
afforded
with
the
announcement
that
it
was
a
christmas
present
fur
mis
whalen
for
a
moment
kendall
had
felt
tempted
to
remonstrate
and
to
ask
patty
if
she
realized
just
how
a
green
turkish
chair
would
look
in
whalen
basement
kitchen
but
after
one
glance
at
radiant
face
she
had
changed
her
mind
and
had
merely
said
very
well
dear
it
shall
be
sent
the
day
you
go
arabella
only
of
all
the
six
delayed
her
choice
until
the
final
minute
even
on
that
last
morning
she
was
hesitating
between
a
marble
statuette
and
a
harmonica
in
the
end
she
took
neither
for
she
had
spied
a
huge
cake
that
the
cook
had
just
made
and
it
was
that
cake
which
finally
went
to
the
station
carefully
packed
in
a
pasteboard
box
and
triumphantly
borne
in
arabella
arms
kendall
herself
went
to
new
york
with
the
children
taking
margaret
with
her
in
the
grand
central
station
she
shuddered
a
little
as
she
passed
a
certain
seat
involuntarily
she
reached
for
her
hand
and
was
it
here
that
i
stayed
and
stayed
that
day
long
ago
when
you
got
hurt
and
did
come
asked
margaret
yes
dear
right
here
seems
as
if
i
remembered
murmured
the
little
girl
her
eyes
fixed
on
one
of
the
great
doors
across
the
room
i
stayed
and
stayed
and
you
never
came
at
all
and
by
and
by
i
went
out
there
to
look
for
you
and
i
walked
and
walked
and
walked
and
i
was
so
tired
and
hungry
yes
yes
dear
i
know
faltered
kendall
tightening
her
clasp
on
the
small
fingers
but
we
wo
think
of
all
that
now
dear
it
is
past
and
gone
come
we
going
to
take
patty

cried
margaret
brightening
we
goin
to
divvy
up
yes
dear
oh
breathed
margaret
ecstatically
i
like
to
divvy
up
and
the
mother
smiled
content
for
the
last
trace
of
gloomy
brooding
had
fled
from
her
daughter
face
and
left
it
glowing
with
the
joy
of
a
child
not
two
hours
later
a
certain
alley
in
the
great
city
was
thrown
into
wild
confusion
out
of
every
window
leaned
disheveled
heads
and
in
every
doorway
stood
a
peering
questioning
throng
down
by
the
basement
door
the
crowd
was
almost
impassable
and
every
inch
of
space
in
the
windows
opposite
was
filled
with
gesticulating
men
women
and
children
mag
of
the
alley
had
come
back
and
as
if
that
were
not
excitement
enough
for
once
with
her
had
come
tom
mary
peter
patty
and
the
twins
to
say
nothing
of
the
beautiful
lady
with
the
golden
hair
and
the
white

her

was
calling
excitedly
over
her
shoulder
katy
and
tony
valerio
had
the
advantage
over
the
others
for
they
were
down
on
their
knees
before
the
whalens
window
on
a
level
with
the
sidewalk
the
room
inside
was
almost
in
darkness
to
be
sure
for
the
crowd
outside
had
obscured
what
little
daylight
there
was
left
and
there
was
only
the
sputtering
kerosene
lamp
on
the
table
for
illumination
even
this
however
sufficed
to
show
katy
and
tony
wonders
that
unloosed
their
tongues
and
set
them
to
giving
copious
reports
she
got

i
in
there
was
a
sudden
commotion
about
the
whalens
door
an
undersized
little
body
was
worming
its
way
through
the
crowd
and
thrusting
sharp
little
elbows
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
next
minute
margaret
kendall
standing
near
the
whalens
table
felt
an
imperative
tug
at
her
sleeve
hullo
say
mag
give
us
a
bite
will
ye
katy
why
it
katy
goldburg
cried
margaret
in
joyous
recognition
mother
here
katy
the
first
touch
of
margaret
hand
on
katy
shoulder
swept
like
an
electric
shock
through
the
waiting
throng
around
the
door
it
was
the
signal
for
a
general
onslaught
in
a
moment
the
whalen
kitchen
swarmed
with
boys
girls
and
women
all
shouting
all
talking
at
once
and
all
struggling
to
reach
the
beautiful
little
girl
they
had
known
as
mag
of
the
alley
step
by
step
margaret
fell
back
until
she
was
quite
against
the
wall
her
eyes
grew
wide
and
yet
she
made
a
brave
attempt
to
smile
and
to
respond
politely
to
the
noisy
greetings
across
the
room
kendall
struggled
to
reach
her
daughter
side
but
the
onrushing
tide
of
humanity
flung
her
back
and
left
her
helpless
and
alone
it
was
then
that
whalen
powerful
fist
and
strident
voice
came
to
the
rescue
in
three
minutes
the
room
was
cleared
and
margaret
was
sobbing
in
her
mother
arms
you
see
mother
you
see
how
is
she
cried
hysterically
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
there
such
lots
and
lots
of
them
and
they
all
so
poor
did
you
see
how
ragged
and
bad
their
clothes
were
and
how
they
grabbed
for
the
cake
we
got
to
divvy
up
mother
we
got
to
divvy
up
yes
dear
i
know
and
we
will
soothed
kendall
hurriedly
we
begin
right
away
darling
but
now
we
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
go
to
bed
my
little
girl
is
tired
and
needs
rest
chapter
ix
spencer
met
kendall
and
her
daughter
at
the
houghtonsville
station
on
the
night
they
returned
from
new
york
his
lips
were
smiling
and
his
eyes
were
joyous
as
befitted
a
lover
who
is
to
behold
for
the
first
time
in
nine
long
days
his
dear
one
face
the
eager
words
of
welcome
died
on
his
lips
however
at
sight
of
the
weariness
and
misery
in
the
two
dear
faces
before
him
why
amy
dearest
he
began
anxiously
but
her
upraised
hand
silenced
him
not
now
she
murmured
with
a
quick
glance
at
margaret
then
aloud
to
her
daughter
she
said
see
dear
here
spencer
and
brought
the
ponies
to
carry
us
home
what
a
delightful
drive
we
will
have
oh
has
he
for
an
instant
margaret
face
glowed
with
animation
then
the
light
died
out
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
but
mother
i
i
think
i
rather
walk
she
said
you
know
patty
and
the
rest
ca
ride
the
doctor
frowned
and
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
under
his
breath
kendall
paled
a
little
and
turned
to
her
daughter
yes
i
know
she
said
gently
but
you
are
very
tired
and
mother
thinks
it
best
you
should
ride
after
all
dearie
you
know
it
make
patty
and
the
rest
ride
even
if
you
do
walk
do
you
see
yes
i
i
suppose
so
admitted
margaret
but
she
sighed
as
she
climbed
into
the
carriage
and
all
the
way
home
her
eyes
were
troubled
not
until
after
margaret
had
gone
to
bed
that
night
did
kendall
answer
the
questions
that
had
trembled
all
the
evening
on
the
lips
then
she
told
him
the
story
of
those
nine
days
in
new
york
beginning
with
margaret
visit
to
the
alley
and
her
overwhelming
reception
in
the
whalens
basement
home
i
afraid
the
whole
thing
has
been
a
mistake
she
said
despondently
when
she
had
finished
instead
of
making
margaret
happy
it
has
made
her
miserable
but
i
do
see
protested
the
doctor
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
you
did
just
what
she
wanted
you
er
up
kendall
sighed
why
of
course
to
a
certain
extent
but
even
margaret
child
though
she
is
saw
the
hopelessness
of
the
task
when
once
we
set
about
it
there
were
so
many
so
pitifully
many
her
few
weeks
of
luxurious
living
here
at
home
have
opened
her
eyes
to
the
difference
between
her
life
and
theirs
and
i
thought
the
child
would
cry
herself
sick
over
it
all
but
you
helped
them
some
of
them
again
kendall
sighed
yes
oh
yes
we
helped
them
i
think
if
margaret
could
have
had
her
way
we
should
have
marched
through
the
streets
to
the
tune
of
the
conquering
hero
comes
distributing
new
dresses
and
frosted
cakes
with
unstinted
hands
but
i
finally
convinced
her
that
such
assistance
was
perhaps
not
the
wisest
way
of
going
about
what
we
wanted
to
do
at
last
i
had
to
keep
her
away
from
the
alley
altogether
it
affected
her
so
i
got
her
interested
in
looking
up
a
new
home
for
the
whalens
and
so
filled
her
mind
with
that
oh
then
the
whalens
have
a
new
home
well
i
sure
margaret
must
have
liked
that
kendall
smiled
wearily
did
she
said
and
at
the
emphasis
the
doctor
raised
his
eyebrows
but
surely
the
whalens
did
not
supplied
kendall
did
not
cried
the
doctor
well
was
this
way
laughed
kendall
it
was
my
idea
to
find
a
nice
little
place
outside
the
city
where
perhaps
whalen
could
raise
vegetables
and
whalen
do
some
sort
of
work
that
paid
better
than
perhaps
margaret
insistence
upon
and
influenced
me
at
any
rate
i
found
the
place
and
in
high
feather
told
the
whalens
of
the
good
fortune
in
store
for
them
what
was
my
surprise
to
be
met
with
blank
silence
save
only
one
wild
whoop
of
glee
from
the
children
sure
then
an
it
in
the
country
is
it
whalen
asked
finally
i
said
a
yard
some
flower
beds
and
a
big
garden
for
vegetables
i
was
just
warming
to
my
subject
once
more
when
whalen
demanded
it
fur
from
the
alley
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
they
at
last
kindly
consented
to
view
the
place
but
after
one
glance
they
would
have
none
of
it
but
why
queried
the
doctor
various
reasons
was
lonesome
too
far
from
the
alley
they
care
to
raise
vegetables
any
way
and
whalen
considered
it
quite
too
much
work
to
up
a
place
like
that
according
to
my
private
opinion
however
the
man
had
an
eye
out
for
a
saloon
and
he
did
see
it
consequently
the
result
well
we
came
back
to
town
and
the
basement
kitchen
margaret
was
inconsolable
when
she
heard
the
decision
the
whalen
children
too
were
disappointed
but
whalen
and
his
wife
were
deaf
to
their
entreaties
in
the
end
i
persuaded
them
to
move
to
rooms
that
at
least
had
the
sun
and
air
though
they
were
still
in
the
alley
and
there
i
left
them
with
a
larder
and
wardrobe
and
with
the
rent
paid
six
months
in
advance
i
shall
keep
my
eye
on
them
of
course
for
margaret
sake
and
i
hope
to
do
something
really
worth
while
for
the
children
patty
and
the
twins
are
still
with
them
at
present
but
was
margaret
satisfied
with
that
asked
the
doctor
yes
so
far
as
it
went
but
there
were
still
the
others
harry
that
child
has
the
whole
alley
on
her
heart
i
at
my
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
you
heard
her
this
afternoon
she
did
want
to
ride
home
because
patty
must
walk
in
new
york
she
looks
askance
at
the
frosting
on
her
cake
and
questions
her
right
to
wear
anything
but
rags
harry
what
can
i
do
the
man
was
silent
i
do
know
dear
he
said
slowly
at
last
we
must
think
and
think
hard
hers
is
not
a
common
case
there
is
no
precedent
to
determine
our
course
small
girls
of
five
that
have
been
reared
in
luxury
are
not
often
thrust
into
the
streets
and
sweat
shops
of
a
great
city
and
there
forced
to
spend
four
years
of
their
life
thank
god
that
those
four
years
should
have
had
a
tremendous
influence
is
certain
she
ca
be
the
same
girl
she
would
have
been
had
she
spent
those
years
at
her
mother
knee
one
thing
is
sure
however
seems
to
me
in
her
present
nervous
condition
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
getting
her
mind
off
those
four
years
of
her
life
and
everything
connected
with
it
it
should
be
done
the
doctor
paused
and
at
that
instant
a
step
sounded
on
the
graveled
driveway
a
moment
later
a
boy
face
flashed
into
the
light
that
streamed
through
the
open
door
why
bobby
is
that
you
cried
kendall
yes
it
me
please
did
mag
i
mean
margaret
come
home
please
yes
she
came
bobby
hesitated
he
stood
first
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
at
last
very
slowly
he
dragged
his
right
hand
from
behind
his
back
i
been
makin
it
for
her
he
said
presenting
a
small
but
very
elaborate
basket
composed
of
mebbe
if
she
ai
er
not
awake
you
give
it
to
her
in
the
mornin
er
thank
ye
much
obliged
and
he
turned
and
fled
down
the
walk
for
a
time
there
was
silence
on
the
veranda
kendall
was
turning
the
basket
over
and
over
in
her
hands
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
you
are
right
harry
she
sighed
her
mind
must
be
taken
off
those
four
years
of
her
life
and
off
everything
connected
with
it
everything
and
everybody
yes
echoed
the
doctor
everything
and
everybody
er
let
me
see
his
basket
please
four
days
later
kendall
and
her
daughter
margaret
left
houghtonsville
for
a
month
stay
in
the
white
mountains
from
the
rear
window
of
a
certain
law
office
in
town
a
boy
of
fourteen
disconsolately
watched
the
long
train
that
was
rapidly
bearing
them
out
of
sight
an
i
hai
seen
her
but
once
since
i
give
her
the
basket
he
was
muttering
an
then
i
could
speak
to
her
her
mother
whisked
her
off
so
quick
plague
take
that
basket
i
never
see
it
an
i
worked
so
hard
over
it
she
said
she
liked
made
out
o
she
said
she
did
chapter
x
it
was
the
day
before
christmas
for
eight
weeks
margaret
had
been
at
elmhurst
miss
dole
school
in
the
berkshires
school
miss
school
had
been
something
of
a
surprise
to
margaret
and
margaret
had
been
decidedly
a
surprise
to
the
school
margaret
was
not
used
to
young
misses
who
fared
sumptuously
every
day
and
who
yet
complained
because
a
favorite
ice
cream
or
a
pet
kind
of
cake
was
not
always
forthcoming
and
miss
dole
pupils
were
not
used
to
a
little
girl
who
questioned
their
right
to
be
and
and
who
supplemented
this
questioning
with
distressing
stories
of
other
little
girls
who
had
little
to
wear
and
less
to
eat
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
margaret
had
not
gone
to
elmhurst
without
a
struggle
on
the
part
of
her
mother
to
kendall
it
seemed
cruel
to
be
separated
so
soon
from
the
little
daughter
who
had
but
just
been
restored
to
her
hungry
arms
after
four
long
years
of
almost
hopeless
waiting
on
the
other
hand
there
were
margaret
own
interests
to
be
thought
of
school
certainly
was
a
necessity
unless
there
should
be
a
governess
at
home
and
of
this
last
kendall
did
not
approve
she
particularly
wished
margaret
to
have
the
companionship
of
happy
girls
of
her
own
age
the
houghtonsville
public
school
was
hardly
the
place
in
opinion
for
a
little
maid
with
margaret
somewhat
peculiar
ideas
as
to
matters
and
things
there
was
bobby
too
bobby
the
constant
reminder
in
word
and
deed
of
the
city
streets
and
misery
that
kendall
particularly
wished
forgotten
yes
there
certainly
was
bobby
to
be
thought
of
and
to
be
avoided
it
was
because
of
all
this
therefore
that
margaret
had
been
sent
to
elmhurst
she
had
gone
there
straight
from
the
great
hotel
in
the
mountains
where
she
and
her
mother
had
been
spending
a
few
weeks
so
she
had
not
seen
houghtonsville
since
september
it
was
the
christmas
vacation
now
and
she
was
going
back
back
to
the
house
with
the
stone
lions
and
the
big
play
room
where
had
lain
for
so
long
the
little
woolly
dog
of
her
babyhood
it
was
not
of
the
stone
lions
nor
the
play
room
that
margaret
was
thinking
however
it
was
of
something
much
more
important
and
more
delightful
the
girls
said
at
all
events
it
was
wonderfully
exciting
and
promised
all
sorts
of
charming
possibilities
in
the
way
of
music
pretty
clothes
and
good
things
to
eat
again
according
to
the
girls
it
was
a
wedding
margaret
idea
of
marriage
had
undergone
a
decided
change
in
the
last
few
weeks
the
envious
delight
of
the
girls
over
the
fact
that
she
was
to
be
so
intimately
connected
with
a
wedding
together
with
their
absorbing
interest
in
every
detail
had
been
far
more
convincing
than
all
of
kendall
anxious
teachings
marriage
might
not
be
such
a
calamity
after
all
it
had
come
as
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
margaret
this
envious
delight
of
her
companions
she
had
looked
upon
her
mother
marriage
as
something
to
be
deplored
something
to
be
tolerated
to
be
sure
since
for
some
unaccountable
reason
her
mother
wanted
it
but
still
nevertheless
an
evil
there
was
the
contract
to
be
sure
and
the
doctor
had
signed
it
without
a
murmur
but
margaret
doubted
the
efficacy
of
even
that
at
times
it
would
take
something
more
than
a
contract
certainly
if
the
doctor
should
prove
to
be
anything
like
mike
whalen
for
a
husband
the
doctor
would
not
be
like
mike
whalen
however
so
the
girls
said
they
had
never
seen
any
husbands
that
were
like
him
for
that
matter
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
husbands
that
shook
and
beat
their
wives
and
banged
them
around
all
this
they
declared
unhesitatingly
and
with
no
little
indignation
in
response
to
margaret
somewhat
doubting
questions
there
were
the
too
the
girls
all
had
them
and
each
book
was
full
of
fair
ladies
and
brave
knights
and
of
beautiful
princesses
who
married
the
king
and
who
wanted
to
marry
him
too
and
who
would
have
felt
very
badly
if
they
could
not
have
married
him
in
the
face
of
so
overwhelming
an
array
of
evidence
margaret
almost
lost
her
fears
marriage
might
be
very
desirable
after
all
and
so
it
was
a
very
happy
little
girl
that
left
elmhurst
on
the
day
before
christmas
and
in
care
of
one
of
the
teachers
journeyed
toward
houghtonsville
where
were
waiting
the
play
room
the
great
stone
lions
and
the
wonderful
wedding
to
say
nothing
of
the
dear
loving
mother
herself
it
was
not
quite
the
same
margaret
that
had
left
houghtonsville
a
few
months
before
even
those
short
weeks
had
not
been
without
their
influence
margaret
in
accordance
with
kendall
urgent
request
had
been
the
special
charge
of
every
teacher
at
elmhurst
and
every
teacher
knew
the
story
of
the
little
girl
life
as
well
as
just
what
they
all
had
now
to
battle
against
everything
that
was
good
and
beautiful
was
kept
constantly
before
her
eyes
and
so
far
as
was
possible
everything
that
was
the
reverse
of
all
this
was
kept
from
her
sight
and
from
being
discussed
in
her
presence
she
learned
of
wonderful
countries
across
the
sea
and
of
the
people
who
lived
in
them
she
studied
about
high
mountains
and
great
rivers
and
she
was
shown
pictures
of
kings
and
queens
and
palaces
systematically
and
persistently
she
was
led
along
a
way
that
did
not
know
the
alley
and
that
did
not
recognize
that
there
was
in
the
world
any
human
creature
who
was
poor
or
sick
or
hungry
it
is
little
wonder
then
that
she
came
to
question
less
and
less
the
luxury
all
about
her
that
she
wore
the
pretty
dresses
and
dainty
shoes
and
ate
the
food
provided
with
a
resignation
that
was
strangely
like
content
and
that
she
talked
less
and
less
of
patty
the
twins
and
the
alley
chapter
xi
christmas
was
a
wonderful
day
at
five
oaks
certainly
to
margaret
first
there
was
the
joy
of
skipping
across
the
room
to
where
the
long
black
stockings
hung
from
the
mantel
in
the
gray
dawn
of
the
early
morning
its
bulging
knobbiness
looked
delightfully
mysterious
and
never
were
presents
half
so
entrancing
as
those
drawn
from
its
black
depths
by
margaret
small
eager
fingers
later
in
the
morning
came
the
behind
the
doctor
span
of
bays
and
then
there
was
the
delicious
dinner
followed
by
the
games
and
the
frolics
and
the
quiet
hour
with
mother
still
later
the
house
began
to
fill
with
guests
and
then
came
the
wedding
with
kendall
all
in
soft
gray
and
looking
radiantly
happy
on
the
doctor
arm
it
was
a
simple
ceremony
and
soon
over
and
then
came
the
long
line
of
beaming
friends
and
neighbors
to
wish
the
bride
and
groom
joy
and
margaret
standing
a
little
apart
by
the
door
felt
a
sudden
pull
at
her
sleeve
she
turned
quickly
and
looked
straight
into
bobby
mcginnis
eyes
bobby
why
bobby
she
welcomed
joyously
but
bobby
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
he
cautioned
then
peremptorily
come
and
he
led
the
way
through
the
deserted
to
a
little
room
off
the
sidehall
where
the
gloom
made
his
presence
almost
indiscernible
there
he
sighed
in
relief
i
fetched
ye
did
i
margaret
frowned
but
bobby
she
remonstrated
why
what
are
you
doing
out
here
all
in
the
dark
seein
you
seeing
me
but
i
was
in
there
where
was
all
light
and
pretty
and
you
could
see
me
lots
better
there
yes
but
i
there
retorted
bobby
grimly
then
he
added
my
party
ye
see
an
i
invited
but
i
wanted
ter
see
ye
an
i
did
too
margaret
was
silent
mebbe
ye
want
ter
go
back
now
yerself
observed
bobby
gloomily
after
a
time
so
pretty
here
i
own
margaret
did
want
to
go
back
and
she
almost
said
so
but
something
in
the
boy
voice
silenced
the
words
on
her
lips
oh
i
stay
she
murmured
shifting
about
uneasily
on
her
little
feet
bobby
roused
himself
here
take
a
chair
he
proposed
pushing
toward
her
a
low
stool
i
set
here
on
the
winder
sill
nice
night
ai
it
yes
is
margaret
sat
down
carefully
spreading
her
skirts
there
was
a
long
silence
through
the
door
came
a
shaft
of
light
and
the
sound
of
distant
voices
bobby
was
biting
his
finger
nails
and
margaret
was
wondering
just
how
she
could
get
back
to
the
without
hurting
the
feelings
of
her
unbidden
guest
at
last
the
boy
spoke
mebbe
when
we
grown
up
we
get
married
too
he
blurted
out
saying
the
one
thing
he
had
intended
not
to
say
he
bit
his
tongue
angrily
but
the
next
minute
he
almost
fell
off
the
window
sill
in
his
amazement
the
little
girl
had
sprung
to
her
feet
and
clapped
her
hands
bobby
could
we
she
cried
sure
rejoined
bobby
with
easy
nonchalance
why
not
and
there
be
flowers
and
music
and
lots
of
people
to
see
us
heaps
promised
bobby
sighed
margaret
ecstatically
and
then
we
go
traveling
over
to
london
and
paris
and
egypt
and
see
the
alps
huh
the
voice
of
the
prospective
young
bridegroom
sounded
a
little
uncertain
we
go
traveling
to
see
things
you
know
reiterated
margaret
there
such
a
lot
of
things
i
want
to
see
oh
yes
we
go
travelin
assured
bobby
promptly
wondering
all
the
while
if
he
could
remember
just
where
his
mother
geography
was
he
should
have
need
of
it
after
he
got
home
that
night
london
paris
egypt
and
the
alps
it
might
be
well
to
look
up
the
way
to
get
there
at
all
events
i
think
maybe
now
i
go
back
said
margaret
with
sudden
stiffness
they
might
be
looking
for
me
oh
i
say
maggie
called
bobby
eagerly
when
folks
is
engaged
they
but
only
the
swish
of
white
skirts
answered
him
and
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
disconsolately
to
let
himself
out
the
side
door
before
any
one
came
and
found
him
and
i
going
to
get
married
too
said
margaret
to
her
mother
half
an
hour
later
you
going
to
get
married
yes
to
bobby
you
know
the
bride
sat
down
suddenly
and
threw
a
quick
look
at
her
husband
to
bobby
she
exclaimed
why
when
where
bobby
was
here
no
smiled
margaret
he
said
he
was
invited
but
he
came
we
fixed
it
all
up
a
little
while
ago
we
going
to
london
and
paris
and
egypt
and
see
the
alps
chapter
xii
the
great
at
hilcrest
the
old
spencer
homestead
was
perhaps
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
the
house
itself
crowned
the
highest
hill
that
overlooked
the
town
and
its
windows
and
the
veranda
without
commanded
a
view
of
the
river
for
miles
just
where
the
valley
was
the
greenest
and
the
most
beautiful
on
the
other
side
of
the
veranda
which
ran
around
three
sides
of
the
house
one
might
see
the
town
with
its
myriad
roofs
and
tall
chimneys
but
although
these
same
tall
chimneys
represented
the
wealth
that
made
possible
the
great
spencer
estate
yet
it
was
the
side
of
the
veranda
overlooking
the
green
valley
that
was
the
most
popular
with
the
family
it
was
said
to
be
sure
that
old
jacob
spencer
who
built
the
house
and
who
laid
the
foundations
for
the
spencer
millions
had
preferred
the
side
that
overlooked
the
town
and
that
he
spent
long
hours
gloating
over
the
visible
results
of
his
thrift
and
enterprise
but
old
jacob
was
dead
now
and
his
son
sons
reigned
instead
and
his
son
sons
no
matter
how
much
they
might
value
the
whiz
and
whir
and
smoke
of
the
town
preferred
when
at
rest
to
gaze
upon
green
hills
and
meadows
this
was
indeed
typical
of
the
spencer
code
the
farther
away
they
could
get
from
the
oil
that
made
the
machinery
of
life
run
easily
and
noiselessly
the
better
pleased
they
were
the
looked
particularly
pleasant
this
july
evening
a
gentle
breeze
stirred
the
curtains
at
the
open
windows
and
the
setting
sun
peeped
through
the
vines
outside
and
glistened
on
the
old
family
plate
three
generations
of
spencers
looked
down
from
the
walls
on
the
two
men
and
the
woman
sitting
at
the
great
mahogany
table
the
two
men
and
the
woman
however
were
not
looking
at
the
sunlight
the
vines
or
the
swaying
curtains
they
were
looking
at
each
other
and
their
eyes
were
troubled
and
questioning
you
say
she
is
coming
next
week
asked
the
younger
man
glancing
at
the
letter
in
the
other
hand
yes
tuesday
afternoon
but
frank
this
is
so
sudden
remonstrated
the
young
fellow
laughing
a
little
as
he
uttered
the
trite
phrase
how
does
it
happen
that
heard
so
little
of
this
young
lady
who
is
to
be
so
unceremoniously
dropped
into
our
midst
next
tuesday
frank
spencer
made
an
impatient
gesture
that
showed
how
great
was
his
perturbation
come
come
ned
do
be
foolish
he
protested
you
know
very
well
that
your
brother
stepdaughter
has
been
my
ward
for
a
dozen
years
yes
but
that
is
all
i
know
rejoined
the
young
man
quietly
i
have
never
seen
her
and
scarcely
ever
heard
of
her
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
take
as
a
matter
of
course
this
strange
young
woman
who
is
none
of
our
kith
nor
kin
and
yet
who
is
to
be
one
of
us
from
henceforth
forevermore
the
boy
is
right
interposed
the
low
voice
of
the
woman
across
the
table
ned
does
know
anything
about
her
he
was
a
mere
child
himself
when
it
all
happened
and
he
been
away
from
home
most
of
the
time
since
for
that
matter
we
do
know
much
about
her
ourselves
we
certainly
do
sighed
frank
spencer
then
he
raised
his
head
and
squared
his
shoulders
see
here
good
people
this
will
never
do
in
the
world
he
asserted
with
sudden
authority
i
have
offered
the
hospitality
of
this
house
to
a
homeless
orphan
girl
and
she
has
accepted
it
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
do
now
but
to
try
to
make
her
happy
after
all
we
need
worry
it
may
turn
out
that
she
will
make
us
happy
but
what
is
she
how
does
she
look
catechized
ned
his
brother
shook
his
head
i
do
know
he
replied
simply
you
do
know
but
surely
you
have
seen
her
yes
oh
yes
i
have
seen
her
once
or
twice
but
margaret
kendall
is
not
a
girl
whom
to
see
is
to
know
besides
the
circumstances
were
such
that
well
i
might
as
well
tell
the
story
from
the
beginning
particularly
as
you
know
so
little
of
it
yourself
frank
paused
and
looked
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
after
a
minute
he
laid
it
gently
down
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
not
quite
steady
our
brother
harry
was
a
physician
as
you
know
ned
you
were
twelve
years
old
when
he
married
a
widow
by
the
name
of
kendall
who
lived
in
houghtonsville
where
he
had
been
practising
as
it
chanced
none
of
us
went
to
the
wedding
you
were
taken
suddenly
ill
and
neither
della
nor
myself
would
leave
you
and
father
was
in
bermuda
that
winter
for
his
health
kendall
had
a
daughter
margaret
about
ten
years
old
who
was
at
school
somewhere
in
the
berkshires
it
was
to
that
school
that
i
went
when
the
terrible
news
came
that
harry
and
his
new
wife
had
lost
their
lives
in
that
awful
railroad
accident
that
was
the
first
time
that
i
saw
margaret
the
poor
child
was
of
course
heartbroken
and
inconsolable
but
her
grief
took
a
peculiar
turn
the
mere
sight
of
me
drove
her
almost
into
hysterics
she
would
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
me
or
with
any
of
her
stepfather
people
she
reasoned
that
if
her
mother
had
not
married
there
would
have
been
no
wedding
journey
and
if
there
had
been
no
wedding
journey
there
would
have
been
no
accident
and
that
her
mother
would
then
have
been
alive
and
well
arguments
pleadings
and
entreaties
were
in
vain
she
would
not
listen
to
me
or
even
see
me
she
held
her
hands
before
her
face
and
screamed
if
i
so
much
as
came
into
the
room
she
was
nothing
but
a
child
of
course
and
not
even
a
normal
one
at
that
for
she
had
had
a
very
strange
life
at
five
she
was
lost
in
new
york
city
and
for
four
years
she
lived
on
the
streets
and
in
the
sweat
shops
enduring
almost
unbelievable
poverty
and
hardships
by
jove
exclaimed
ned
under
his
breath
it
was
only
seven
or
eight
months
before
the
wedding
that
she
was
found
went
on
frank
and
of
course
the
influence
of
the
wild
life
she
had
led
was
still
with
her
more
or
less
and
made
her
not
easily
subject
to
control
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
leave
the
poor
little
thing
where
she
was
particularly
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
place
for
her
she
would
not
come
with
me
and
she
had
no
people
of
her
own
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
love
and
sympathy
as
you
know
poor
harry
was
conscious
for
some
hours
after
the
accident
long
enough
to
make
his
will
and
dictate
the
letter
to
me
leaving
margaret
to
my
care
boy
though
i
was
i
was
only
twenty
you
see
but
really
there
was
no
one
else
to
whom
he
could
leave
her
that
was
something
over
thirteen
years
ago
margaret
must
be
about
now
and
you
not
seen
her
since
there
was
keen
reproach
in
ned
voice
frank
smiled
yes
i
seen
her
twice
he
replied
and
of
course
i
written
to
her
many
times
and
have
always
kept
in
touch
with
those
she
was
with
she
stayed
at
the
berkshire
school
five
years
then
with
some
fear
and
trembling
i
own
i
went
to
see
her
i
found
a
little
miss
who
answered
my
questions
with
studied
politeness
and
who
agreed
without
comment
to
the
proposition
that
i
place
her
in
a
school
where
she
might
remain
until
she
was
ready
for
college
should
she
elect
to
go
to
college
but
her
vacations
did
she
never
come
then
questioned
ned
no
at
first
i
did
not
ask
her
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
question
as
she
was
feeling
some
one
of
her
teachers
always
looked
out
for
her
they
all
pitied
her
and
naturally
did
everything
they
could
for
her
as
did
her
mates
at
school
later
when
i
did
dare
to
ask
her
to
come
here
she
always
refused
she
wrote
me
stiff
little
notes
in
which
she
informed
me
that
she
was
to
spend
the
holidays
with
some
blanche
or
dorothy
or
mabel
of
her
acquaintance
she
was
nineteen
when
i
saw
her
again
i
found
now
a
charming
graceful
girl
with
peculiarly
haunting
blue
eyes
and
heavy
coils
of
hair
that
kinked
and
curled
about
her
little
pink
ears
in
a
most
distracting
fashion
even
now
though
she
would
not
come
to
my
home
she
was
going
abroad
with
friends
the
party
included
an
irreproachable
chaperon
so
of
course
i
had
nothing
to
say
while
as
for
money
she
had
all
of
her
mother
not
inconsiderable
fortune
besides
everything
that
had
been
her
stepfather
so
of
course
there
was
no
question
on
that
score
in
the
fall
she
entered
college
and
there
she
has
been
ever
since
spending
her
vacations
as
usual
with
friends
generally
traveling
when
she
came
of
age
she
specially
requested
me
to
make
no
change
in
her
affairs
but
to
regard
herself
as
my
ward
for
the
present
just
as
she
had
been
so
i
still
call
myself
her
guardian
this
june
was
her
graduation
i
had
forgotten
the
fact
until
i
received
the
little
engraved
invitation
a
week
or
two
ago
i
thought
of
running
down
for
it
but
i
could
get
away
very
well
and
well
i
did
go
that
all
but
i
did
write
and
ask
her
to
make
this
house
her
home
and
here
is
her
reply
she
thanks
me
and
will
come
next
tuesday
there
now
you
have
it
you
know
all
that
i
do
and
frank
spencer
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
long
sigh
but
i
do
know
yet
what
she
like
objected
ned
neither
do
i
oh
but
you
seen
her
yes
and
how
do
you
suppose
that
those
two
or
three
meetings
were
very
illuminating
no
i
been
told
this
however
he
added
it
seems
that
immediately
after
her
return
to
her
mother
home
she
had
the
most
absurd
quixotic
notions
about
sharing
all
she
had
with
every
ragamuffin
in
new
york
she
even
carried
her
distress
over
their
condition
to
such
an
extent
that
her
mother
really
feared
for
her
reason
all
her
teachers
therefore
were
instructed
to
keep
from
her
all
further
knowledge
of
poverty
and
trouble
and
particularly
to
instil
into
her
mind
the
fact
that
there
was
really
in
the
world
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
happiness
over
across
the
table
merideth
shivered
a
little
dear
me
she
sighed
i
do
hope
the
child
is
well
over
those
notions
i
should
want
her
to
mix
up
here
with
the
mill
people
i
never
did
quite
like
those
settlement
women
anyway
and
only
think
what
might
happen
with
one
in
one
own
family
i
do
think
i
should
worry
sister
sweet
laughed
frank
i
seen
much
of
the
young
lady
but
i
think
i
have
seen
enough
for
that
i
fancy
the
teachers
succeeded
in
their
mission
as
near
as
i
can
judge
miss
margaret
kendall
does
not
resemble
your
dreaded
in
the
least
however
we
wait
and
see
chapter
xiii
there
was
something
of
the
precision
of
clockwork
in
matters
and
things
at
hilcrest
a
large
corps
of
servants
in
charge
of
an
excellent
housekeeper
left
merideth
free
to
go
and
come
and
entertain
as
she
liked
for
fifteen
years
now
she
had
been
mistress
of
hilcrest
ever
since
her
mother
had
died
in
fact
widowed
herself
at
after
a
year
of
married
life
and
the
only
daughter
in
a
family
of
four
children
she
had
been
like
a
second
mother
to
her
two
younger
brothers
harry
the
eldest
brother
had
early
left
the
home
roof
to
study
medicine
frank
barely
twenty
when
his
brother
harry
lost
his
life
had
even
then
pleased
his
father
by
electing
the
mills
as
his
and
now
five
years
after
that
father
death
ned
was
sharing
his
brother
frank
care
and
responsibility
in
keeping
the
great
wheels
turning
and
the
great
chimneys
smoking
in
the
town
below
della
merideth
was
essentially
a
woman
who
liked
and
who
usually
obtained
the
strawberries
and
cream
of
life
always
accustomed
to
luxury
she
demanded
as
a
matter
of
course
rich
clothing
and
dainty
food
that
there
were
people
in
the
world
whose
clothing
was
coarse
and
whose
food
was
scanty
she
well
knew
and
knowing
this
she
was
careful
that
her
donations
to
the
home
missionary
society
and
the
woman
guild
were
prompt
and
liberal
beyond
this
her
duty
did
not
extend
she
was
sure
as
for
any
personal
interest
in
the
recipients
of
her
alms
she
had
none
whatever
and
would
indeed
have
deemed
it
both
unnecessary
and
unladylike
that
she
should
have
had
such
interest
her
eyes
were
always
on
the
hills
and
meadows
on
the
west
side
of
the
house
and
even
her
way
to
and
from
hilcrest
was
carefully
planned
so
that
she
might
avoid
so
far
as
was
possible
the
narrow
streets
of
the
town
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
frank
spencer
was
a
man
of
business
inside
the
office
of
spencer
spencer
outside
he
was
a
delightful
gentleman
a
little
grave
perhaps
for
his
years
but
none
the
less
a
favorite
particularly
with
anxious
mothers
having
marriageable
but
rather
daughters
on
their
hands
his
eyes
were
brown
his
nose
was
straight
and
long
and
his
mouth
firm
and
his
whole
appearance
was
that
of
a
man
sure
of
himself
and
of
others
to
frank
spencer
the
vast
interests
of
spencer
spencer
as
represented
by
the
huge
mills
that
lined
the
river
bank
were
merely
one
big
machine
and
the
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
that
dragged
their
weary
way
in
and
out
the
great
doors
were
but
so
many
cogs
in
the
wheels
that
the
cogs
had
hearts
that
ached
and
heads
that
throbbed
did
not
occur
to
him
he
was
interested
only
in
the
smooth
and
silent
running
of
the
wheels
themselves
ned
was
the
baby
of
the
house
in
spite
of
his
length
of
limb
and
breadth
of
shoulder
he
was
still
looked
upon
by
his
brother
and
sister
as
little
more
than
a
boy
school
college
and
a
year
of
travel
had
trained
his
brain
toughened
his
muscles
and
browned
his
skin
and
left
him
full
of
enthusiasm
for
his
chosen
work
which
just
now
meant
helping
to
push
spencer
spencer
to
the
top
notch
of
power
and
prosperity
for
five
years
the
two
brothers
and
the
widowed
sister
in
the
great
house
that
crowned
prospect
hill
had
been
by
themselves
save
for
the
servants
and
the
occasional
guests
and
the
spencers
were
a
clannish
family
so
people
said
however
that
might
have
been
there
certainly
was
not
one
of
the
three
that
was
not
conscious
of
a
vague
fear
and
a
regret
whenever
there
came
the
thought
of
this
strange
young
woman
who
was
so
soon
to
enter
their
lives
to
be
a
spencer
was
to
be
hospitable
however
and
the
preparations
for
the
expected
guest
were
prompt
and
generous
by
tuesday
the
entire
house
even
to
its
inmates
was
ready
with
a
cordial
welcome
for
the
orphan
girl
in
his
big
touring
car
frank
spencer
went
to
the
station
to
meet
his
ward
with
him
was
merideth
and
her
eyes
fully
as
anxiously
as
his
swept
the
crowd
of
passengers
alighting
from
the
long
train
almost
simultaneously
they
saw
the
tall
young
woman
in
gray
and
merideth
sighed
with
relief
as
frank
gave
a
quick
exclamation
and
hurried
forward
at
least
she
looks
like
a
lady
merideth
murmured
as
she
followed
her
brother
you
are
margaret
kendall
i
am
sure
frank
was
saying
and
merideth
saw
the
light
leap
to
the
girl
eyes
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
you
are
spencer
my
guardian
frank
am
i
still
to
call
you
frank
merideth
heard
a
clear
voice
say
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
looking
into
what
she
instantly
thought
were
the
most
wonderful
eyes
she
had
ever
seen
and
i
am
merideth
my
dear
della
i
hope
she
said
gently
before
her
brother
could
speak
thank
you
and
it
will
be
della
i
sure
smiled
the
girl
and
again
merideth
marveled
at
the
curious
charm
of
the
eyes
that
met
her
own
chapter
xiv
the
big
touring
car
skirted
the
edge
of
the
town
avoiding
as
usual
the
narrower
streets
and
turning
as
soon
as
possible
into
a
wide
avenue
we
have
to
climb
to
reach
hilcrest
called
frank
over
his
shoulder
as
the
car
began
a
steep
ascent
then
you
must
have
a
view
as
a
reward
rejoined
margaret
we
do
declared
merideth
but
not
here
she
laughed
as
the
car
plunged
into
the
depths
of
a
miniature
forest
it
was
a
silent
drive
in
the
main
the
man
in
front
had
the
car
to
guide
the
two
women
in
the
tonneau
dropped
an
occasional
word
but
for
the
most
part
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
bird
or
flower
or
on
the
shifting
gleams
of
sunlight
through
the
trees
the
very
fact
that
there
was
no
constraint
in
this
silence
argued
well
for
the
place
the
orphan
girl
had
already
found
in
the
hearts
of
her
two
companions
not
until
the
top
of
the
hill
was
reached
and
the
car
swung
around
the
broad
curve
of
the
driveway
did
the
full
beauty
of
the
panorama
before
her
burst
on
margaret
eyes
she
gave
a
low
cry
of
delight
oh
how
beautiful
how
wonderfully
wonderfully
beautiful
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
were
on
the
silver
sheen
of
the
river
trailing
along
the
green
velvet
of
the
valley
far
below
she
had
turned
her
back
on
the
town
with
its
smoking
chimneys
the
sun
was
just
setting
when
a
little
later
she
walked
across
the
lawn
to
where
a
rustic
seat
marked
the
abrupt
descent
of
the
hill
far
below
the
river
turned
sharply
on
the
left
it
flowed
through
a
cañon
of
walls
and
under
a
pall
of
smoke
on
the
right
it
washed
the
shores
of
flowering
meadows
and
mirrored
the
sunset
sky
in
its
depths
so
absorbed
was
margaret
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
that
she
did
not
notice
the
figure
of
a
man
coming
up
the
winding
path
at
her
left
even
ned
spencer
himself
did
not
see
the
girl
until
he
was
almost
upon
her
then
he
stopped
short
his
lips
breaking
into
a
noiseless
well
by
jove
a
twig
snapped
under
his
foot
at
his
next
step
and
the
girl
turned
oh
it
you
she
said
absorbedly
i
could
wait
i
came
right
out
to
see
it
she
finished
her
eyes
once
more
on
the
valley
below
the
brothers
at
first
glance
looked
wonderfully
alike
and
margaret
had
unhesitatingly
taken
ned
to
be
frank
ned
did
not
speak
he
too
like
his
sister
an
hour
before
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
a
pair
of
wondrous
blue
eyes
it
seems
to
me
said
the
girl
slowly
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
ever
trouble
me
if
i
had
that
to
look
at
it
seems
so
to
me
too
agreed
ned
but
he
was
not
looking
at
the
view
the
girl
turned
sharply
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
the
embarrassed
red
flew
to
her
cheeks
oh
you
you
are
not
uncle
frank
at
all
she
stammered
a
sudden
light
of
comprehension
broke
over
ned
face
and
so
this
was
margaret
how
stupid
of
him
not
to
have
known
at
once
he
laughed
lightly
and
made
a
low
bow
i
have
not
that
honor
he
confessed
but
you
you
must
be
miss
kendall
and
you
i
ned
smiled
quizzically
i
oh
i
am
your
ned
he
announced
and
his
voice
and
his
emphasis
told
her
that
he
fully
appreciated
his
privilege
in
being
and
uncle
to
a
niece
of
chapter
xv
by
the
end
of
the
month
the
family
at
hilcrest
wondered
how
they
had
ever
lived
before
they
saw
the
world
and
everything
in
it
through
the
blue
eyes
of
margaret
kendall
the
world
and
everything
in
it
seemed
so
much
more
beautiful
now
never
were
the
long
mornings
in
the
garden
or
on
the
veranda
so
delightful
to
merideth
as
now
with
a
bright
sympathetic
girl
to
laugh
chat
or
keep
silent
as
the
whim
of
the
moment
dictated
and
never
were
the
summer
evenings
so
charming
to
frank
as
now
when
one
might
lie
back
in
one
chair
or
hammock
and
listen
to
a
dreamy
nocturne
or
a
rippling
and
realize
that
the
musician
was
no
bird
of
passage
but
that
she
was
one
own
beloved
ward
and
was
even
now
at
home
as
for
ned
never
were
the
golf
links
in
so
fine
a
shape
nor
the
tennis
court
and
croquet
ground
so
alluring
and
never
had
he
known
before
how
many
really
delightful
trips
there
were
within
a
day
run
for
his
and
yet
della
do
you
think
margaret
is
happy
asked
frank
one
day
as
he
and
his
sister
and
ned
were
watching
the
sunset
from
the
west
veranda
margaret
had
gone
into
the
house
pleading
a
headache
as
an
excuse
for
leaving
them
della
was
silent
it
was
ned
who
answered
indignantly
why
frank
of
course
she
happy
i
not
so
sure
hesitated
frank
then
merideth
spoke
she
happy
yes
but
she
restless
frank
leaned
forward
that
it
exactly
he
declared
with
conviction
she
restless
and
what
the
matter
that
what
i
want
to
know
nonsense
it
just
high
spirits
cut
in
ned
with
an
impatient
gesture
margaret
perfectly
happy
does
she
laugh
and
sing
and
motor
and
play
tennis
all
day
yes
retorted
his
brother
she
does
but
behind
it
all
there
a
curious
something
that
i
ca
get
at
it
is
as
if
she
were
were
trying
to
get
away
from
something
something
within
herself
merideth
nodded
her
head
i
know
she
said
i
seen
it
too
ah
you
have
frank
turned
to
his
sister
with
a
troubled
frown
well
what
is
it
i
do
know
merideth
paused
her
eyes
on
the
distant
i
have
thought
once
or
twice
she
resumed
slowly
that
margaret
might
be
in
love
in
love
cried
two
voices
in
shocked
amazement
had
merideth
been
observant
she
might
have
seen
the
sudden
paling
of
a
face
and
the
quick
clinching
of
a
strong
white
hand
that
rested
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
near
her
but
she
was
not
observant
in
this
case
at
least
and
she
went
on
quietly
yes
but
on
the
whole
i
inclined
to
doubt
that
now
oh
you
are
laughed
ned
a
little
nervously
his
brother
did
not
speak
yes
repeated
merideth
but
i
have
decided
yet
what
it
is
well
i
for
one
do
believe
it
anything
declared
ned
stubbornly
to
me
she
seems
happy
and
i
believe
she
is
frank
shook
his
head
no
he
said
by
her
own
confession
she
has
been
flitting
from
one
place
to
another
all
over
the
world
and
though
perhaps
she
does
not
realize
it
herself
i
believe
her
coming
here
was
merely
another
effort
on
her
part
to
get
away
from
this
something
this
something
that
while
within
herself
perhaps
is
none
the
less
pursuing
her
and
making
her
restless
and
unhappy
but
what
can
it
be
argued
ned
she
not
so
different
from
other
girls
only
nicer
she
likes
good
times
and
pretty
clothes
and
is
always
ready
for
any
fun
that
going
i
sure
it
is
anything
about
those
socialistic
notions
that
della
used
to
worry
about
he
added
laughingly
she
got
well
over
those
if
she
ever
had
them
indeed
i
do
believe
she
looked
toward
the
mills
since
she
been
here
much
less
wanted
to
know
anything
about
the
people
that
work
in
them
no
it
is
that
agreed
frank
perhaps
it
is
anything
broke
in
della
with
sudden
cheeriness
maybe
it
is
a
little
dull
here
for
her
after
all
her
gay
friends
and
interesting
travels
perhaps
she
is
a
little
homesick
but
is
trying
to
make
us
think
everything
is
all
right
and
she
overdoes
it
anyway
we
ask
some
nice
people
up
for
a
week
or
two
i
fancy
we
all
need
livening
up

getting
morbid

chapter
xvi
it
had
been
a
particularly
delightful
day
with
the
hilcrest
they
had
gone
early
in
the
morning
to
silver
lake
for
a
picnic
a
sail
on
the
lake
a
delicious
luncheon
and
a
climb
up
hilltop
had
filled
every
hour
with
enjoyment
until
five
when
they
had
started
for
home
two
of
the
guests
had
brought
their
own
to
hilcrest
and
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
miss
kendall
was
making
the
homeward
trip
and
you
call
this
a
mr
brandon
she
laughed
gaily
as
the
huge
car
darted
forward
i
should
as
soon
think
of
having
an
elephant
for
an
errand
boy
brandon
laughed
but
just
wait
until
you
see
the
elephant
get
over
the
ground
he
retorted
and
after
all
the
car
is
so
big
when
you
compare
it
with
harlow
or
frank
it
only
seats
two
you
know
but
its
engine
is
quite
as
powerful
as
either
of
theirs
i
want
you
to
see
what
it
can
do
he
finished
as
he
began
gradually
to
increase
their
speed
for
some
time
neither
spoke
the
road
ran
straight
ahead
in
a
narrowing
band
of
white
that
lost
itself
in
a
thicket
of
green
far
in
the
distance
yet
almost
immediately
it
seemed
to
margaret
the
green
was
at
their
right
and
their
left
and
the
road
had
unwound
another
white
length
of
ribbon
that
flung
itself
across
the
valley
and
up
the
opposite
hill
to
the
houses
trees
barns
and
bushes
rushed
by
like
specters
and
the
soft
august
air
swept
by
her
cheeks
like
a
november
gale
not
until
the
opposite
hill
was
reached
however
did
brandon
slacken
speed
you
see
he
exulted
we
can
just
annihilate
space
with
this
you
certainly
can
laughed
margaret
a
little
hysterically
and
you
may
count
yourself
lucky
if
you
do
annihilate
anything
else
brandon
brought
the
car
almost
to
a
stop
i
was
a
brute
i
frightened
you
he
cried
with
quick
contrition
the
girl
shook
her
head
a
strange
light
came
to
her
eyes
no
i
liked
it
she
answered
i
liked
it
too
well
do
you
know
i
never
dare
to
run
a
car
by
myself
very
much
i
learned
how
and
had
a
little
runabout
of
my
own
at
college
and
i
run
one
now
sometimes
but
it
came
over
me
one
day
the
power
there
was
under
my
fingers
almost
involuntarily
i
began
to
let
it
out
i
went
faster
and
faster
and
yet
i
did
not
go
half
fast
enough
something
seemed
to
be
pushing
me
on
urging
me
to
even
greater
and
greater
speed
i
wanted
to
get
away
away
then
i
came
to
myself
i
was
miles
from
where
i
should
have
been
and
in
a
locality
i
knew
nothing
about
i
had
no
little
difficulty
in
getting
back
to
where
i
belonged
besides
having
a
fine
or
two
to
pay
i
believe
i
was
frightened
and
ashamed
for
everywhere
i
heard
of
stories
of
terrified
men
women
children
and
animals
and
of
how
i
had
narrowly
escaped
having
death
itself
to
answer
for
as
a
result
of
my
mad
race
through
the
country
and
yet
even
now
i
felt
that
wild
exhilaration
of
motion
i
did
not
want
to
stop
i
wanted
to
go
on
and
on
she
paused
suddenly
and
fell
back
in
her
seat
you
see
she
laughed
with
a
complete
change
of
manner
i
am
not
to
be
trusted
as
a
chauffeur
i
see
nodded
brandon
a
little
soberly
then
with
a
whimsical
smile
perhaps
i
should
want
the
brakes
shifted
to
my
side
of
the
car
if
i
rode
with
you
but
after
all
when
you
come
right
down
to
the
solid
comfort
of
motoring
you
can
take
it
best
by
jogging
along
like
this
at
a
good
sensible
rate
of
speed
that
will
let
you
see
something
of
the
country
you
are
passing
through
look
at
those
clouds
we
shall
have
a
gorgeous
sunset
it
was
almost
an
hour
later
that
brandon
stopped
his
car
where
two
roads
crossed
and
looked
behind
him
by
george
where
are
those
people
he
queried
but
we
started
first
and
we
came
rapidly
for
a
time
reminded
the
girl
i
know
but
we
been
simply
creeping
for
the
last
mile
or
two
returned
the
man
i
slowed
up
purposely
to
fall
in
behind
the
rest
not
so
sure
i
know
the
way
from
here
but
perhaps
you
do
and
he
turned
his
eyes
questioningly
to
hers
not
i
she
laughed
but
i
thought
you
did
so
did
i
he
grumbled
i
been
over
this
road
enough
in
times
past
oh
i
can
get
back
to
hilcrest
all
right
he
added
reassuringly
only
that
i
do
remember
which
is
the
best
way
one
road
takes
us
through
the
town
and
is
not
so
pleasant
i
wanted
to
avoid
that
if
possible
never
mind
let
go
on
proposed
the
girl
it
getting
late
and
we
might
miss
them
even
if
we
waited
they
may
have
taken
another
road
farther
back
if
they
thought
you
knew
the
way
they
would
feel
in
duty
bound
to
keep
track
of
us
and
they
may
have
already
reached
home
i
do
mind
a
bit
which
road
we
take
all
right
acquiesced
brandon
just
as
you
say
i
think
this
is
the
one
anyhow
we
try
it
and
he
turned
his
car
to
the
left
the
sun
had
dipped
behind
the
hills
and
the
quick
chill
of
an
august
evening
was
in
the
air
margaret
shivered
and
reached
for
her
coat
the
road
wound
in
and
out
through
a
scrubby
growth
of
trees
then
turned
sharply
and
skirted
the
base
of
a
steep
hill
beyond
the
next
turn
it
dropped
in
a
gentle
descent
and
ran
between
wide
open
fields
a
house
appeared
then
another
and
another
a
man
and
a
woman
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
road
and
stopped
while
the
automobile
passed
the
houses
grew
more
frequent
and
children
and
small
dogs
scurried
across
the
road
to
a
point
of
safety
by
george
i
believe
we
got
the
wrong
road
now
muttered
brandon
with
a
frown
shall
we
go
back
no
no
demurred
the
girl
what
does
it
matter
it
only
another
way
around
and
perhaps
no
longer
than
the
other
the
road
turned
and
dropped
again
the
hill
was
steeper
now
the
air
grew
heavy
and
fanned
margaret
cheek
with
a
warm
breath
as
if
from
an
oven
unconsciously
she
loosened
the
coat
at
her
throat
why
how
warm
it
is
she
exclaimed
yes
i
fancy
there
no
doubt
now
where
we
are
frowned
brandon
i
thought
as
much
he
finished
as
the
car
swung
around
a
curve
straight
ahead
the
road
ran
between
lines
of
squat
brown
houses
with
men
women
and
children
swarming
on
the
or
hanging
on
the
fences
beyond
rose
tier
upon
tier
of
red
and
brown
roofs
flanked
on
the
left
by
the
towering
chimneys
of
the
mills
still
farther
beyond
and
a
little
to
the
right
just
where
the
sky
was
reddest
rose
the
terraced
slopes
of
prospect
hill
crowned
by
the
towers
and
turrets
of
hilcrest
we
can
at
least
see
where
we
want
to
be
laughed
brandon
fine
old
place
shows
up
great
against
that
sky
does
it
the
girl
at
his
side
did
not
answer
her
eyes
had
widened
a
little
and
her
cheeks
had
lost
their
bright
color
she
was
not
looking
at
the
pile
of
brick
and
stone
on
top
of
prospect
hill
but
at
the
ragged
little
urchins
and
pallid
women
that
fell
back
from
the
roadway
before
the
car
the
boys
yelled
derisively
and
a
baby
cried
margaret
shrank
back
in
her
seat
and
brandon
turning
quickly
saw
the
look
on
her
face
his
own
jaw
set
into
determined
lines
we
be
out
of
this
soon
miss
kendall
he
assured
her
you
mind
them
as
if
it
was
bad
enough
to
come
here
anyway
but
that
i
must
needs
come
now
just
when
the
is
getting
home
the
yes
the
hands
who
work
days
you
know
but
do
they
all
work
days
brandon
laughed
hardly
you
mean
they
work
yes
he
threw
a
quizzical
smile
into
her
startled
eyes
by
the
way
he
observed
you
better
not
ask
frank
in
that
tone
of
voice
if
they
work
nights
that
is
a
special
pet
of
his
he
says
it
one
great
secret
of
the
mills
prosperity
having
two
shifts
not
that
his
are
the
only
mills
that
run
nights
of
course
there
are
plenty
more
margaret
lips
parted
but
before
she
could
speak
there
came
a
hoarse
shout
and
a
quick
cry
of
terror
the
next
instant
the
car
under
brandon
skilful
hands
swerved
sharply
and
just
avoided
a
collision
with
a
boy
on
a
bicycle
narrow
shave
that
muttered
brandon
he
was
even
looking
where
he
was
going
margaret
shuddered
she
turned
her
gaze
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
everywhere
were
wan
faces
and
sunken
eyes
with
a
little
cry
she
clutched
brandon
arm
ca
we
go
faster
faster
she
moaned
i
want
to
get
away
away
for
answer
came
the
sharp
of
the
horn
and
the
car
bounded
forward
with
a
shout
the
crowd
fell
back
and
with
another
brandon
took
the
first
turn
to
the
right
i
think
we
out
of
the
worst
of
it
he
cried
in
margaret
ear
if
we
keep
to
the
right
we
go
through
only
the
edge
of
the
town
even
as
he
spoke
the
way
cleared
more
and
more
before
them
and
the
houses
grew
farther
apart
the
town
was
almost
behind
them
and
their
speed
had
considerably
lessened
when
margaret
gave
a
scream
of
horror
almost
instantly
brandon
brought
the
car
to
a
stop
and
leaped
to
the
ground
close
by
one
of
the
wheels
lay
a
huddled
little
heap
of
soiled
and
ragged
pink
calico
but
before
brandon
could
reach
it
the
heap
stirred
and
lifted
itself
from
beneath
a
tangled
thatch
of
brown
curls
looked
out
two
big
brown
eyes
i
reckon
mebbe
i
felled
down
said
a
cheery
voice
that
yet
sounded
a
little
dazed
i
reckon
i
did
good
heavens
baby
i
reckon
you
did
breathed
the
man
in
glad
relief
and
you
may
thank
your
lucky
stars
was
no
worse
lucky
stars
what
are
lucky
stars
demanded
the
small
girl
interestedly
eh
oh
lucky
stars
why
they
what
are
lucky
stars
miss
kendall
margaret
did
not
answer
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
with
eyes
that
carried
a
fascinated
terror
in
their
blue
depths
she
was
looking
at
the
dirty
little
feet
and
the
ragged
dress
of
the
child
before
her
lucky
stars
murmured
the
little
girl
again
putting
out
a
cautious
finger
and
just
touching
the
fat
rubber
tire
of
the
wheel
that
had
almost
crushed
out
her
life
brandon
shuddered
involuntarily
and
drew
the
child
away
what
your
name
little
girl
he
asked
gently
maggie
how
old
are
you
i
five
goin
on
six
an
i
be
twelve
brandon
smiled
and
where
do
you
live
he
continued
a
thin
little
claw
of
a
finger
pointed
to
an
unpainted
cottage
across
the
street
at
that
moment
a
shrill
voice
called
maggie
maggie
what
ye
doin
come
here
child
and
a
tall
gaunt
woman
appeared
in
the
doorway
maggie
turned
slowly
but
scarcely
had
the
little
bare
feet
taken
one
step
when
the
girl
in
the
automobile
stirred
as
if
waking
from
sleep
here
quick
little
girl
take
this
she
cried
tearing
open
the
little
jeweled
purse
at
her
belt
and
thrusting
all
its
contents
into
the
small
grimy
hands
maggie
stared
in
wonder
then
her
whole
face
lighted
up
lucky
stars
she
cried
gleefully
her
eyes
on
the
shining
coins
lucky
stars
and
she
turned
and
ran
with
all
her
small
might
toward
the
house
quick
come
let
us
go
begged
margaret
before
the
mother
sees
the
money
and
brandon
smiling
indulgently
at
the
generosity
that
was
so
fearful
of
receiving
thanks
lost
no
time
in
putting
a
long
stretch
of
roadway
between
themselves
and
the
tall
gaunt
woman
behind
them

lucky

maggie
was
still
shouting
gleefully
when
she
reached
her
mother
side

bent
keen
eyes
on
her
young
daughter
face
maggie
what
was
they
sayin
to

began
pulling
the
little
girl
into
the
house
suddenly
her
jaw
dropped
she
stooped
and
clutched
the
child
hands
why
maggie
it
money
stacks
of

she
exclaimed
prying
open
the
small
fingers
stars
lucky

cooed
maggie
maggie
liked
new
words
and
phrases
and
she
always
said
them
over
and
over
until
they
were
new
no
longer
durgin
shook
her
daughter
gently
yet
determinedly
her
small
black
eyes
looked
almost
large
so
wide
were
they
with
amazement
maggie
maggie
tell
me
what

they
say

she
demanded
again
why

they
give

was
silent
her
brow
was
drawn
into
a
thoughtful
frown
but
maggie

insisted
the
child
i
jest

lucky

a
sudden
thought
sent
a
quick
flash
of
fear
to
durgin
eyes

did

she
cried
dropping
on
her
knees
and
running
swift
anxious
fingers
over
the
thin
little
arms
and
legs
and
body
they
did
hurt
ye
maggie
shook
her
head
at
that
moment
a
shadow
darkened
the
doorway
and
the
kneeling
woman
glanced
up
hastily
oh

mis
magoon
she
said
to
the
small
woman
in
the
doorway
yes

sighed
the
woman
dragging
herself
across
the
room
to
a
chair
what
time

here
why
i
dunno
mebbe
four
why
the
woman
face
contracted
with
a
sharp
spasm
of
pain
she
within
half
a
mile
of
the
mill
when
i
met
her

she
was

all

she
for
a
moment
durgin

gradually
her
eyes
drifted
back
to
maggie
and
the
little
pile
of
coins
on
the
table
mis
magoon
see
she
cried
eagerly
what
the
lady

o

an
maggie
felled
down
in
the
road

mite
not

but
they
give

all

money
the
woman
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
sniffed
disdainfully
well
what
of
it
they
oughter
give
it
to
her
she
asserted
but
they
ter
blame
an
they
did
hurt

magoon
for

crossly
but
with
undeniable
interest
she
asked
how

retorted
as
she
gathered
up
the
coins
from
the
table
but
thar

so
i
goin
ter
get

fur
nellie
anyhow
so
and
she
turned
her
back
and
pretended
not
to
hear
the
faint
remonstrances
from
the
woman
over
by
the
window
later
when
she
had
bought
the
medicine
and
had
placed
it
in
magoon
hands
the
remonstrances
were
repeated
in
a
higher
key
and
were
accompanied
again
with
an
angry
snarl
against
the
world
in
general
and
automobiles
in
particular
but
why
do
ye
hate
so
demanded
durgin
them
autymobiles

chapter
xviii
margaret
kendall
did
not
sleep
well
the
night
after
the
picnic
at
silver
lake
she
was
restless
and
she
tossed
from
side
to
side
finding
nowhere
a
position
that
brought
ease
of
mind
and
body
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
but
her
active
brain
painted
the
dark
with
a
panorama
of
the
day
happenings
and
whether
her
eyes
were
open
or
closed
she
was
forced
to
see
it
there
were
the
lake
the
mountain
and
the
dainty
luncheon
spread
on
the
grass
and
there
were
the
faces
of
the
merry
friends
who
had
accompanied
her
there
were
the
shifting
scenes
of
the
homeward
ride
too
with
the
towers
of
hilcrest
showing
dark
and
against
a
sky
but
everywhere
from
the
lake
the
mountain
and
even
from
hilcrest
itself
looked
out
strange
wan
faces
with
hollow
cheeks
and
mournful
eyes
and
everywhere
fluttered
the
ragged
skirts
of
a
child
pink
calico
dress
it
was
two
when
margaret
arose
thrust
her
feet
into
a
pair
of
and
her
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
a
long
loose
there
was
no
moon
but
a
starlit
sky
could
be
seen
through
the
open
windows
and
margaret
easily
found
her
way
across
the
room
to
the
door
that
led
to
the
balcony
margaret
room
like
the
below
looked
toward
the
west
and
the
meadows
but
from
the
turn
of
the
balcony
where
it
curved
to
the
left
one
might
see
the
town
and
it
was
toward
this
curve
that
margaret
walked
now
once
there
she
stopped
and
stood
motionless
her
slender
hands
on
the
balcony
rail
the
night
was
wonderfully
clear
the
wide
dome
of
the
sky
twinkled
with
a
myriad
of
stars
and
seemed
to
laugh
at
the
town
below
with
its
puny
little
lights
blinking
up
out
of
the
dark
where
the
streets
crossed
and
recrossed
over
by
the
river
where
the
mills
pointed
big
black
fingers
at
the
sky
however
the
lights
did
not
blink
they
blazed
in
tier
upon
tier
and
line
upon
line
of
windows
and
they
glowed
with
a
glare
that
sent
a
shudder
to
the
watching
girl
on
the
balcony
and
they
working
now
she
almost
sobbed
then
she
turned
with
a
little
cry
and
ran
down
the
balcony
toward
her
room
where
was
waiting
the
cool
soft
bed
with
the
sheets
in
spite
of
the
restless
night
she
had
spent
margaret
arose
early
the
next
morning
the
house
was
very
quiet
when
she
came
and
only
the
subdued
rustle
of
the
parlor
maid
skirts
broke
the
silence
of
the
great
hall
which
was
also
the
at
hilcrest
betty
miss
courtesied
the
girl
miss
kendall
had
almost
reached
the
outer
hall
door
when
she
turned
abruptly
betty
you
you
do
know
a
little
child
named
er
do
you
she
asked
betty
almost
dropped
the
vase
she
was
dusting
a
little
girl
named
she
one
of
the
the
mill
people
children
i
think
betty
drew
herself
erect
no
miss
i
do
she
said
crisply
no
of
course
not
murmured
miss
kendall
unconsciously
acknowledging
the
reproach
in
betty
voice
then
she
turned
and
went
out
the
wide
hall
door
twice
she
walked
from
end
to
end
of
the
long
veranda
but
not
once
did
she
look
toward
the
mills
and
when
she
sat
down
a
little
later
her
chair
was
so
placed
that
it
did
not
command
a
view
of
the
red
and
brown
roofs
of
the
town
miss
kendall
was
restless
that
day
she
rode
and
drove
and
sang
and
played
and
won
at
golf
and
tennis
but
behind
it
all
was
a
feverish
gayety
that
came
sometimes
perilously
near
to
recklessness
frank
spencer
and
his
sister
watched
her
with
troubled
eyes
and
even
ned
gave
an
anxious
frown
once
or
twice
just
before
dinner
brandon
came
upon
her
alone
in
the
music
room
where
she
was
racing
her
fingers
through
the
runs
and
trills
of
an
impromptu
at
an
almost
impossible
speed
if
you
take
me
motoring
with
you
miss
kendall
he
said
whimsically
when
the
music
had
ceased
with
a
crashing
chord
if
you
take
me
i
shall
make
sure
that
the
brakes
on
my
side
of
the
car
the
girl
laughed
then
grew
suddenly
grave
you
would
need
to
she
acceded
but
i
shall
not
take
you
or
any
one
else
motoring
in
the
early
evening
after
dinner
margaret
sought
her
guardian
he
was
at
his
desk
in
his
own
special
den
out
of
the
library
and
the
door
was
open
may
i
come
in
she
asked
spencer
sprang
to
his
feet
by
all
means
he
cried
as
he
placed
a
chair
you
do
often
honor
me
like
this
but
this
is
where
you
do
business
when
at
home
is
it
she
inquired
and
i
i
have
come
to
do
business
the
man
laughed
so
it
business
just
plain
sordid
business
to
which
i
am
indebted
for
this
he
bemoaned
playfully
well
and
what
is
it
income
too
small
for
expenses
he
chuckled
a
little
and
he
could
afford
to
margaret
had
made
no
mistake
in
asking
him
still
to
have
the
handling
of
her
property
the
results
had
been
eminently
satisfactory
both
to
his
pride
and
her
pocketbook
no
no
it
not
that
it
the
mills
the
mills
yes
is
it
quite
quite
necessary
to
work
nights
for
a
moment
the
man
stared
wordlessly
then
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
why
margaret
what
in
the
world
he
stopped
from
sheer
inability
to
proceed
he
had
suddenly
remembered
the
stories
he
had
heard
of
the
early
life
of
this
girl
before
him
and
of
her
childhood
horror
at
the
difference
between
the
lot
of
the
rich
and
the
poor
last
night
we
we
came
through
the
town
explained
margaret
a
little
feverishly
and
brandon
happened
to
mention
that
they
worked
nights
the
man
at
the
desk
roused
himself
yes
i
see
he
said
kindly
you
were
surprised
of
course
but
worry
my
child
or
let
it
fret
you
a
moment
it
nothing
new
they
are
used
to
it
they
have
done
it
for
years
but
at
night
all
night
it
does
seem
right
and
it
must
be
so
hard
they
do
it
why
of
course
other
mills
run
nights
why
should
ours
they
expect
it
margaret
besides
they
are
paid
for
it
come
come
dear
girl
just
look
at
it
sensibly
why
it
the
night
work
that
helps
to
swell
your
dividends
margaret
winced
i
i
think
i
prefer
them
smaller
she
faltered
she
hesitated
then
spoke
again
there
another
thing
too
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
there
was
a
little
girl
maggie
she
lives
in
one
of
those
shabby
unpainted
houses
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
want
to
do
something
for
her
will
you
see
that
this
reaches
her
mother
please
and
she
held
out
a
fat
roll
of
closely
folded
bills
now
do
please
do
she
cried
as
she
saw
the
man
remonstrative
gesture
please
do
say
you
ca
and
that
indiscriminate
giving
encourages
pauperism
i
used
to
hear
that
so
often
at
school
whenever
i
wanted
to
give
something
and
i
i
hated
it
if
you
could
have
seen
that
poor
little
girl
yesterday
you
will
see
that
she
gets
it
wo
you
but
margaret
began
the
man
helplessly
i
do
know
the
child
there
are
so
many
he
stopped
and
margaret
picked
up
the
dropped
thread
but
you
can
find
out
she
urged
you
must
find
out
her
maggie
you
can
inquire
some
one
will
know
but
do
you
see
the
man
face
cleared
suddenly
i
give
it
to
della
he
broke
off
in
quick
relief
she
runs
the
charity
part
and
she
know
just
what
to
do
with
it
meanwhile
let
me
thank
you
no
no
interrupted
margaret
rising
to
go
it
is
you
i
have
to
thank
for
doing
it
for
me
she
finished
as
she
hurried
from
the
room
by
george
muttered
the
man
as
he
looked
at
the
denominations
of
the
bills
in
his
fingers
i
not
so
sure
but
we
may
have
our
hands
full
after
all
certainly
if
she
keeps
on
as
she
begun
chapter
xix
it
was
after
eight
the
morning
for
so
early
in
september
was
raw
and
cold
a
tall
young
fellow
with
alert
gray
eyes
and
a
square
chin
hurried
around
the
corner
of
one
of
the
great
mills
and
almost
knocked
down
a
small
girl
who
was
coming
toward
him
with
head
bent
to
the
wind
he
cried
then
stopped
short
the
child
had
fallen
back
and
was
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
building
in
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
she
was
thin
and
pale
and
looked
as
if
she
might
be
eleven
years
old
well
well
he
exclaimed
as
soon
as
the
child
caught
her
breath
i
reckon
there
room
for
both
of
us
in
the
world
after
all
then
kindly
where
were
you
going
home
sir
he
threw
a
keen
look
into
her
face
are
you
one
of
the
mill
girls
yes
sir
night
shift
she
nodded
but
it
late
it
after
eight
why
did
you
go
home
with
the
rest
the
child
hesitated
her
eyes
swerved
from
his
gaze
she
looked
as
if
she
wanted
to
run
away
come
come
he
urged
kindly
answer
me
i
wo
hurt
you
i
may
help
you
let
us
go
around
here
where
the
wind
does
blow
so
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
sheltered
side
of
the
building
now
tell
us
all
about
it
why
did
you
go
home
with
the
rest
i
did
start
to
sir
but
i
was
so
tired
an
an
i
coughed
so
i
stopped
to
rest
it
was
nice
an
cool
out
here
an
i
was
so
hot
in
there
she
jerked
her
thumb
toward
the
mill
yes
yes
i
know
he
said
hastily
and
his
lips
set
into
stern
lines
as
he
thought
of
the
hundreds
of
other
little
girls
that
found
the
raw
morning
nice
and
cool
after
the
hot
moist
air
of
the
mills
but
do
you
see
he
protested
earnestly
that
that
the
very
time
you
must
stop
and
rest
you
take
cold
and
that
what
makes
you
cough
you
should
be
he
stopped
abruptly
what
your
name
he
asked
nellie
magoon
how
old
are
you
the
thin
little
face
before
him
grew
suddenly
drawn
and
old
and
the
eyes
met
his
with
a
look
that
was
and
wholly
defiant
i
thirteen
sir
how
old
were
you
when
you
began
to
work
here
twelve
sir
the
answer
was
prompt
and
sure
the
child
had
evidently
been
well
trained
where
do
you
live
over
on
the
prospect
hill
road
but
that
a
long
way
from
here
yes
sir
i
does
get
tired
and
you
walked
it
a
good
many
times
too
have
you
said
the
man
quietly
let
see
how
long
is
it
that
you
worked
at
the
mills
two
years
sir
a
single
word
came
sharply
from
between
the
man
teeth
and
nellie
wondered
why
the
kind
young
man
with
the
pleasant
eyes
should
suddenly
look
so
very
cross
and
stern
at
that
moment
too
she
remembered
something
she
had
seen
this
man
many
times
about
the
mills
why
was
he
questioning
her
perhaps
he
was
not
going
to
let
her
work
any
more
and
if
he
did
not
let
her
work
what
would
her
mother
say
and
do
please
sir
i
must
go
quick
she
cried
suddenly
starting
forward
i
all
well
now
an
i
ai
tired
a
mite
i
be
back
jest
remember
i
thirteen
an
i
likes
ter
work
in
the
mills
i
likes
ter
sir
she
shouted
back
at
him
humph
muttered
the
man
as
he
watched
the
frail
little
figure
disappear
down
the
street
i
thought
as
much
then
he
turned
and
strode
into
the
mill
oh
spencer
i
like
to
speak
to
you
please
sir
he
called
hurrying
forward
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
younger
member
of
the
firm
of
spencer
spencer
fifteen
minutes
later
ned
spencer
entered
his
brother
office
and
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
well
he
began
wearily
mcginnis
is
on
the
again
frank
smiled
so
what
up
now
oh
same
old
thing
children
working
under
age
by
his
own
story
the
girl
herself
swears
she
thirteen
but
he
says
she
is
frank
shrugged
his
shoulders
perhaps
he
knows
better
than
the
girl
parents
he
observed
dryly
he
better
look
her
up
on
our
registers
or
he
might
ask
to
see
her
certificate
ned
laughed
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
good
heavens
frank
he
snapped
as
if
was
our
fault
that
they
lie
so
about
the
kids
ages
they
put
a
babe
in
arms
at
the
frames
if
they
could
but
mcginnis
by
the
way
where
did
you
get
that
fellow
and
how
long
have
you
had
him
i
ca
remember
when
he
was
here
he
acts
as
if
he
owned
the
whole
concern
and
had
a
personal
interest
in
every
bobbin
in
it
that
exactly
it
laughed
frank
he
a
personal
interest
and
that
why
i
keep
him
and
put
up
with
some
of
his
meddling
that
not
quite
so
pleasant
he
as
honest
as
the
daylight
and
as
faithful
as
the
sun
where
did
you
get
him
he
must
have
been
here
ages
ages
well
for
twelve
maybe
thirteen
years
to
be
exact
he
was
a
mere
boy
fourteen
or
fifteen
when
he
came
he
said
he
was
from
houghtonsville
and
that
he
had
known
harry
spencer
he
asked
for
work
any
kind
and
brought
good
references
we
used
him
about
the
office
for
awhile
then
gradually
worked
him
into
the
mills
he
was
bright
and
capable
and
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
please
so
we
pushed
him
ahead
rapidly
he
went
to
night
school
at
once
and
has
taken
one
or
two
of
those
correspondence
courses
until
he
acquired
really
a
good
education
he
practically
indispensable
to
me
now
anyhow
i
found
out
that
he
was
when
he
was
laid
up
for
a
month
last
winter
he
stands
between
me
and
the
hands
like
a
strong
tower
and
takes
any
amount
of
responsibility
off
my
shoulders
you
see
for
yourself
when
been
here
longer
the
hands
like
him
and
will
do
anything
for
him
that
why
i
put
up
with
some
of
his
notions
they
getting
pretty
frequent
of
late
however
and
he
becoming
a
little
too
meddlesome
i
may
have
to
call
him
down
a
peg
you
think
so
i
fancy
if
you
had
heard
him
run
on
about
this
half
an
hour
ago
laughed
ned
he
said
he
should
speak
to
you
very
good
then
i
can
speak
to
him
retorted
the
other
grimly
chapter
xx
early
in
the
second
week
of
september
the
houseful
of
guests
at
hilcrest
went
away
leaving
the
family
once
more
alone
it
seems
good
does
it
just
by
ourselves
said
margaret
that
first
morning
at
breakfast
as
she
spoke
three
pairs
of
eyes
flashed
a
message
of
exultant
thankfulness
to
each
other
and
three
heads
nodded
an
i
told
you
so
when
margaret
gaze
was
turned
away
later
merideth
put
the
sentiment
into
words
as
she
followed
her
brothers
to
the
door
you
see
i
was
right
she
declared
margaret
only
needed
livening
up
she
all
right
now
and
will
be
contented
here
with
us
sure
agreed
ned
as
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
veranda
frank
paused
a
moment
has
she
ever
been
to
you
again
della
with
money
or
or
anything
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
no
never
replied
merideth
she
asked
once
if
i
found
the
child
maggie
to
give
the
money
to
and
i
evaded
a
direct
reply
i
told
her
i
had
put
the
money
into
the
hands
of
the
guild
and
that
they
were
in
constant
touch
with
all
cases
of
need
i
got
her
interested
in
talking
of
something
else
and
she
did
not
say
anything
more
about
it
good
it
the
best
way
you
know
her
history
and
how
morbid
she
got
when
she
was
a
child
it
wo
do
to
run
any
chances
of
that
happening
again
and
i
fear
take
much
to
bring
it
back
she
was
not
a
little
excited
when
she
brought
the
money
in
to
me
that
night
we
must
watch
out
sharp
he
finished
as
he
passed
through
the
door
and
hurried
down
the
steps
after
his
brother
back
in
the
margaret
had
wandered
listlessly
to
the
window
it
had
been
some
weeks
since
she
had
seen
a
long
day
before
her
with
no
plans
to
check
off
the
time
into
hours
and
of
expected
happenings
she
told
herself
that
it
was
a
relief
and
that
she
liked
it
but
her
fingers
tapped
idly
upon
the
window
and
her
eyes
gazed
at
a
cloud
sailing
across
a
deep
blue
sky
after
a
time
she
turned
to
the
door
near
by
and
stepped
out
upon
the
veranda
she
could
hear
voices
from
around
the
corner
and
aimlessly
she
wandered
toward
them
but
before
she
had
reached
the
turn
the
voices
had
ceased
and
a
minute
later
she
saw
frank
and
ned
step
into
the
waiting
automobile
and
whir
rapidly
down
the
driveway
merideth
had
disappeared
into
the
house
and
margaret
found
herself
alone
slowly
she
walked
toward
the
railing
and
looked
at
the
town
far
below
the
roofs
showed
red
and
brown
and
gray
in
the
sunlight
and
were
packed
close
together
save
at
the
outer
edges
where
they
thinned
into
a
straggling
fringe
of
small
cottages
and
dilapidated
shanties
margaret
shivered
with
repulsion
how
dreadful
it
must
be
to
live
like
that
no
air
no
sun
no
view
of
the
sky
and
of
the
cool
green
valley
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
those
poor
creatures
down
there
with
their
wasted
forms
and
sunken
eyes
she
shuddered
again
as
she
thought
of
how
they
had
thronged
the
road
on
the
day
of
the
picnic
at
silver
lake
and
then
she
turned
and
walked
with
resolute
steps
to
the
farther
side
of
the
veranda
where
only
the
valley
and
the
hills
met
her
eyes
it
had
been
like
this
with
margaret
every
day
since
that
memorable
ride
home
with
brandon
always
her
steps
her
eyes
and
her
thoughts
had
turned
toward
the
town
and
always
with
uncompromising
determination
they
had
been
turned
about
again
by
sheer
force
of
will
until
they
looked
toward
the
valley
with
its
impersonal
green
and
silver
until
now
there
had
been
gay
companions
and
absorbing
pastimes
to
make
this
turning
easy
and
effectual
now
there
was
only
the
long
unbroken
day
of
idleness
in
prospect
and
the
turning
was
neither
so
easy
nor
so
effectual
the
huddled
roofs
and
dilapidated
shanties
of
the
town
looked
up
at
her
even
from
the
green
of
the
valley
and
the
wasted
forms
and
hollow
eyes
of
the
mill
workers
blurred
the
sheen
of
the
river
i
go
down
there
she
cried
aloud
with
sudden
impulsiveness
go
back
through
the
way
we
came
up
then
perhaps
i
be
cured
and
she
hurried
away
to
order
the
runabout
to
be
brought
to
the
door
for
her
use
to
margaret
it
was
all
very
clear
she
needed
but
a
sane
daylight
ride
through
those
streets
down
there
to
drive
away
forever
the
morbid
fancies
that
had
haunted
her
so
long
she
told
herself
that
it
was
the
hour
the
atmosphere
the
that
had
painted
the
picture
of
horror
for
her
under
the
clear
light
of
the
sun
those
swarming
multitudes
would
be
merely
men
women
and
children
not
haunting
ghosts
of
misery
there
was
the
child
maggie
too
perhaps
she
might
be
found
and
it
would
be
delightful
indeed
to
see
for
herself
the
comforting
results
of
the
spending
of
that
roll
of
money
she
had
put
into
her
guardian
hands
some
time
before
of
all
this
margaret
thought
and
it
was
therefore
with
not
unpleasant
anticipations
that
she
stepped
into
the
runabout
a
little
later
and
waved
a
to
merideth
with
a
cheery
i
off
for
a
little
spin
aunt
della
i
be
back
before
luncheon
margaret
was
very
sure
that
she
knew
the
way
and
some
distance
below
the
house
she
made
the
turn
that
would
lead
to
what
was
known
as
the
town
road
the
air
was
fresh
and
sweet
and
the
sun
flickered
through
the
trees
in
dancing
little
flecks
of
light
that
set
the
girl
pulses
to
throbbing
in
sympathy
and
caused
her
to
send
the
car
bounding
forward
as
if
it
too
had
red
blood
in
its
veins
far
down
the
hill
the
woods
thinned
rapidly
and
a
house
or
two
appeared
margaret
went
more
slowly
now
somewhere
was
the
home
of
little
maggie
and
she
did
not
want
to
miss
it
houses
and
more
houses
appeared
and
the
trees
were
left
behind
there
was
now
only
the
glaring
sunlight
showing
up
in
all
their
barrenness
the
shabby
little
cottages
with
their
dooryards
strewn
with
tin
cans
and
bits
of
paper
and
swarming
with
crying
babies
from
somewhere
came
running
a
barefooted
urchin
then
another
and
another
until
the
road
seemed
lined
with
them
hi
thar
look
at
de
wid
de
gal
in
it
shrieked
a
gleeful
voice
and
instantly
the
cry
was
taken
up
and
echoed
from
across
the
street
with
shrill
catcalls
and
derisive
laughter
margaret
was
frightened
she
tooted
her
horn
furiously
and
tried
to
forge
ahead
but
the
children
reading
aright
the
terror
in
her
eyes
swarmed
about
her
until
she
was
forced
to
bring
the
car
almost
to
a
stop
lest
she
run
over
the
small
squirming
bodies
with
shrieks
of
delight
the
children
instantly
saw
their
advantage
and
lost
no
time
in
making
the
most
of
it
they
leaped
upon
the
low
step
and
clung
to
the
sides
and
front
of
the
car
like
leeches
two
larger
boys
climbed
to
the
back
and
hung
there
with
swinging
feet
their
jeering
lips
close
to
miss
kendall
shrinking
ears
a
third
boy
still
more
venturesome
had
almost
reached
the
vacant
seat
at
miss
kendall
side
when
above
the
din
of
hoots
and
laughter
sounded
an
angry
voice
and
a
sharp
command
chapter
xxi
it
had
been
young
mcginnis
intention
to
look
up
the
home
and
the
parents
of
the
little
nellie
magoon
at
once
and
see
if
something
could
not
be
done
to
keep
for
a
time
at
least
that
frail
bit
of
humanity
out
of
the
mills
some
days
had
elapsed
however
since
he
had
talked
with
the
child
and
not
until
now
had
he
found
the
time
to
carry
out
his
plan
he
was
hurrying
with
frowning
brow
along
the
lower
end
of
prospect
hill
road
when
suddenly
his
ears
were
assailed
by
the
unmistakable
evidence
that
somewhere
a
mob
of
small
boys
had
found
an
object
upon
which
to
vent
their
wildest
mischief
the
next
moment
a
turn
of
the
road
revealed
the
almost
motionless
runabout
with
its
living
freight
of
shrieking
urchins
and
its
one
terrified
girl
with
a
margaret
mcginnis
sprang
forward
illustration
a
mob
of
small
boys
had
found
an
object
upon
which
to
vent
their
wildest
mischief
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
that
even
the
girl
herself
could
not
have
told
how
it
happened
almost
unconsciously
she
slipped
over
into
the
vacant
seat
and
gave
her
place
to
the
fearless
man
who
seemingly
had
risen
from
the
ground
an
apparently
impossible
number
of
long
arms
shot
out
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
the
squirming
urchins
dropped
to
the
ground
sprawling
on
all
fours
and
howling
with
surprise
and
chagrin
then
came
a
warning
cry
and
a
sharp
from
the
horn
the
next
moment
the
car
bounded
forward
on
a
roadway
that
opened
clear
and
straight
before
it
not
until
he
had
left
the
town
quite
behind
him
did
mcginnis
bring
the
car
to
a
halt
in
the
shade
of
a
great
tree
by
the
roadside
then
he
turned
an
anxious
face
to
the
girl
at
his
side
you
not
hurt
i
hope
miss
kendall
he
began
i
did
like
to
stop
before
to
ask
i
hope
you
did
mind
being
thrust
so
unceremoniously
out
of
your
place
and
run
away
with
he
finished
a
faint
twinkle
coming
into
his
gray
eyes
margaret
flushed
before
she
spoke
she
put
both
hands
to
her
head
and
straightened
her
hat
no
i
i
not
hurt
she
said
faintly
but
i
frightened
you
you
were
very
good
to
run
away
with
me
she
added
the
red
deepening
in
her
cheeks
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
the
man
face
darkened
the
little
rascals
he
cried
they
deserve
a
sound
thrashing
every
one
of
them
but
i
done
nothing
i
not
spoken
to
them
she
protested
i
see
why
they
should
have
molested
me
pure
mischief
to
begin
with
probably
returned
the
man
then
they
saw
that
you
were
frightened
and
that
set
them
wild
with
delight
all
is
i
glad
i
was
there
he
concluded
with
grim
finality
margaret
turned
quickly
and
so
am
i
she
said
and
yet
i
do
even
know
whom
to
thank
though
you
evidently
know
me
you
seemed
to
come
from
the
ground
and
you
handled
the
car
as
if
it
were
your
own
with
a
sudden
exclamation
the
man
stepped
to
the
ground
then
he
turned
and
faced
her
hat
in
hand
and
i
acting
now
as
if
it
were
my
own
too
he
said
almost
bitterly
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
kendall
i
have
run
it
many
times
for
spencer
that
explains
my
familiarity
with
it
and
you
are
she
paused
expectantly
the
man
hesitated
it
was
almost
on
his
tongue
end
to
say
one
of
the
then
something
in
the
bright
face
the
pleasant
smile
the
hand
sent
a
strange
light
to
his
eyes
i
am
miss
kendall
i
have
half
a
mind
to
tell
you
who
i
am
she
threw
a
quick
look
into
his
face
and
drew
back
a
little
but
she
said
graciously
of
course
you
will
tell
me
who
you
are
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
slowly
he
asked
do
you
remember
bobby
mcginnis
bobby
bobby
mcginnis
the
blue
eyes
half
closed
and
seemed
to
be
looking
far
into
the
past
suddenly
they
opened
wide
and
flashed
a
glad
recognition
into
his
face
and
are
you
bobby
mcginnis
yes
why
of
course
i
remember
bobby
mcginnis
she
cried
with
outstretched
hand
it
was
you
that
found
me
when
i
was
a
wee
bit
of
a
girl
and
lost
in
new
york
though
i
do
remember
but
we
used
to
play
together
there
in
houghtonsville
and
it
was
you
that
got
me
the
contract
she
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
her
face
away
the
man
saw
her
lips
and
chin
tremble
i
ca
speak
of
it
even
now
she
said
brokenly
after
a
moment
then
gently
tell
me
of
yourself
how
came
you
here
i
came
here
at
once
from
houghtonsville
mcginnis
voice
too
was
not
quite
steady
she
nodded
and
he
went
on
without
explaining
the
at
once
he
had
thought
she
would
understand
i
went
to
work
in
the
mills
and
i
have
been
here
ever
since
that
is
all
he
said
simply
but
how
happened
it
that
you
came
here
a
dull
red
flushed
the
man
cheeks
his
eyes
swerved
from
her
level
gaze
then
came
back
suddenly
with
the
old
boyish
twinkle
in
their
depths
i
came
he
began
slowly
well
to
look
after
your
affairs
affairs
yes
i
was
fifteen
i
deemed
somehow
that
i
was
the
one
remaining
friend
who
had
your
best
interests
at
heart
i
look
after
you
naturally
in
a
girls
school
so
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
looked
after
your
inheritance
dear
old
bobby
murmured
the
girl
and
the
man
who
heard
knew
in
spite
of
a
conscious
throb
of
joy
that
it
was
the
lad
that
margaret
kendall
saw
before
her
not
the
standing
at
her
side
i
suppose
i
thought
he
resumed
after
a
moment
that
if
i
were
not
here
some
one
might
pick
up
the
mills
and
run
off
with
them
and
now
she
was
back
in
the
present
and
her
eyes
were
merry
and
now
well
now
i
come
nearer
realizing
my
limitations
perhaps
he
laughed
at
any
rate
i
learned
long
ago
that
your
interests
were
in
excellent
hands
and
that
my
presence
could
do
very
little
good
even
if
they
had
not
been
in
such
fine
shape
but
i
am
keeping
you
he
broke
off
suddenly
backing
away
from
the
car
are
you
can
you
you
do
not
need
me
any
longer
to
run
the
machine
you
not
go
back
through
the
town
of
course
no
i
shall
not
go
back
through
the
town
shuddered
the
girl
and
i
can
drive
very
well
by
myself
now
i
am
sure
she
declared
and
he
did
not
know
that
for
a
moment
she
had
been
tempted
to
give
quite
the
opposite
answer
i
shall
go
on
to
the
next
turn
and
then
around
home
by
the
other
way
but
i
shall
see
you
soon
again
you
will
come
to
see
me
she
finished
as
she
held
out
her
hand
mcginnis
shook
his
head
miss
kendall
in
the
kindness
of
her
heart
forgets
he
reminded
her
quietly
bobby
mcginnis
is
not
on
hilcrest
calling
list
but
bobby
mcginnis
is
my
friend
retorted
miss
kendall
with
a
bright
smile
and
hilcrest
always
welcomes
my
friends
still
standing
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
tree
mcginnis
watched
the
runabout
until
a
turn
of
the
road
hid
it
from
sight
i
thought
be
easier
after
i
met
her
once
face
to
face
and
spoken
to
her
he
was
murmuring
softly
but
it
going
to
be
harder
i
afraid
harder
than
when
i
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
once
in
a
while
and
knew
that
she
was
here
chapter
xxii
margaret
morning
ride
through
the
town
did
not
have
quite
the
effect
she
had
hoped
it
would
by
daylight
the
place
looked
even
worse
than
by
the
softening
twilight
but
she
was
haunted
now
not
so
much
by
the
wan
faces
of
the
workers
as
by
the
jeering
countenances
of
a
mob
of
mischievous
boys
to
be
sure
the
unexpected
meeting
with
bobby
mcginnis
had
in
a
measure
blurred
the
vision
but
it
was
still
there
and
at
night
she
awoke
sometimes
with
those
horrid
shouts
in
her
ears
of
one
thing
it
had
cured
her
however
she
no
longer
wished
to
see
for
herself
the
shabby
cottages
and
the
people
in
them
she
gave
money
promptly
and
liberally
so
liberally
in
fact
that
merideth
quite
caught
her
breath
at
the
size
of
the
bills
that
the
young
woman
stuffed
into
her
hands
but
my
dear
so
much
she
had
remonstrated
no
no
take
it
do
margaret
had
pleaded
give
it
to
that
society
to
do
as
they
like
with
it
and
when
it
gone
there
be
more
merideth
had
taken
the
money
then
without
more
ado
the
one
thing
she
wished
particularly
to
avoid
in
the
matter
was
controversy
for
controversy
meant
interest
there
had
been
one
other
result
of
that
morning
experience
a
result
which
to
frank
spencer
was
perhaps
quite
as
startling
as
had
been
the
roll
of
bills
to
his
sister
i
met
your
robert
mcginnis
when
i
was
out
this
morning
margaret
had
said
that
night
at
dinner
what
sort
of
man
is
he
before
frank
could
reply
ned
had
answered
for
him
he
a
little
tin
god
on
wheels
margaret
that
can
do
no
wrong
what
he
is
ned
remonstrated
merideth
in
a
horror
that
was
not
all
playful
then
to
margaret
he
is
a
very
faithful
fellow
and
an
efficient
workman
my
dear
who
is
a
great
help
to
frank
but
how
and
where
did
see
him
margaret
laughed
i
tell
you
she
promised
in
response
to
merideth
question
but
i
have
heard
yet
from
the
head
of
the
house
i
can
add
little
to
what
has
been
said
declared
frank
with
a
smile
he
is
all
that
they
pictured
him
he
is
the
the
keystone
anything
you
please
but
why
nothing
only
i
know
him
he
is
an
old
friend
you
know
him
a
the
three
voices
were
one
in
shocked
amazement
yes
long
ago
in
houghtonsville
smiled
margaret
he
knew
me
still
longer
ago
than
that
but
that
part
i
remember
only
as
it
has
been
told
to
me
he
was
the
little
boy
who
found
me
crying
in
the
streets
of
new
york
and
took
me
home
to
his
mother
there
was
a
stunned
silence
around
the
table
it
was
the
first
time
the
spencers
had
ever
heard
margaret
speak
voluntarily
of
her
childhood
and
it
frightened
them
it
seemed
to
bring
into
the
perfumed
air
of
the
the
visible
presence
of
poverty
and
misery
they
feared
too
for
margaret
this
was
the
one
thing
that
must
be
guarded
against
the
possible
return
to
the
morbid
fancies
of
her
youth
and
this
man
why
how
strange
murmured
merideth
breaking
the
pause
but
then
after
all
he
not
annoy
you
i
fancy
of
course
not
cut
in
ned
mcginnis
is
no
fool
and
he
knows
his
place
most
assuredly
declared
frank
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
his
lips
you
not
see
him
again
i
fancy
if
he
annoys
you
let
me
know
oh
but
be
an
annoyance
smiled
margaret
i
him
to
come
and
see
me
you
asked
him
to
come
to
the
spencers
it
was
as
if
she
had
taken
one
of
the
big
black
wheels
from
the
mills
and
suggested
its
desirability
for
the
you
asked
him
to
come
was
there
a
slight
lifting
of
the
delicately
moulded
chin
opposite
the
least
possible
dilation
of
the
sensitive
nostrils
perhaps
yet
margaret
voice
when
she
answered
was
clear
and
sweet
yes
i
told
him
that
hilcrest
would
always
welcome
my
friends
i
was
sure
and
was
i
right
of
course
certainly
three
almost
inaudible
voices
had
murmured
and
that
had
been
the
end
of
it
except
that
the
two
brothers
and
the
sister
had
talked
it
over
in
low
distressed
voices
after
margaret
had
gone
to
bed
two
weeks
had
passed
now
however
since
that
memorable
night
and
the
veranda
of
hilcrest
had
not
yet
echoed
to
the
sound
of
young
feet
the
spencers
breathed
a
little
more
freely
in
consequence
it
might
be
possible
after
all
thought
they
that
had
some
sense
and
the
emphasis
was
eloquent
chapter
xxiii
miss
kendall
was
sitting
alone
before
the
great
fireplace
in
the
hall
at
hilcrest
when
betty
the
parlor
maid
found
her
betty
nose
always
inclined
to
an
upward
tilt
was
even
more
disdainful
than
usual
this
morning
in
fact
betty
whole
self
from
cap
to
dainty
shoes
radiated
strong
disapproval
there
a
young
person
a
very
impertinent
young
person
at
the
side
door
miss
who
insists
upon
seeing
you
she
said
severely
me
seeing
me
who
is
it
betty
i
do
know
miss
she
looks
like
a
mill
girl
even
betty
voice
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
mill
as
if
it
feared
contamination
a
mill
girl
then
it
must
be
merideth
or
spencer
that
she
wants
to
see
she
said
you
miss
she
said
she
wanted
to
see
betty
stopped
looking
a
little
frightened
yes
go
on
betty
that
that
she
wanted
to
see
miss
kendall
blurted
out
the
horrified
betty
of
the
alley
miss
kendall
sprang
to
her
feet
bring
the
girl
here
betty
she
directed
quickly
i
will
see
her
at
once
just
what
and
whom
she
expected
to
see
margaret
could
not
have
told
for
the
first
surprised
instant
it
seemed
that
some
dimly
remembered
patty
or
clarabella
or
arabella
from
the
past
must
be
waiting
out
there
at
the
door
the
next
moment
she
knew
that
this
was
impossible
for
time
even
in
the
alley
could
not
have
stood
still
and
patty
and
the
twins
must
be
now
out
at
the
side
door
the
impertinent
young
person
received
order
to
come
in
with
an
airy
toss
of
her
head
and
a
jeering
there
what
i
tell
ye
but
once
in
the
subdued
luxury
of
soft
rugs
and
silken
hangings
and
face
to
face
with
a
beauteous
vision
in
a
trailing
pale
blue
gown
she
became
at
once
only
a
very
much
frightened
little
girl
about
eleven
years
old
at
a
sign
from
miss
kendall
betty
withdrew
and
left
the
two
alone
what
is
your
name
little
girl
asked
miss
kendall
gently
the
child
swallowed
and
choked
a
little
nellie
magoon
if
you
please
thank
you
she
stammered
where
do
you
live
down
on
the
prospect
hill
road
who
sent
you
to
me
mis
durgin
miss
kendall
frowned
and
paused
a
moment
as
yet
there
had
not
been
a
name
that
she
recognized
nor
could
she
find
in
the
child
face
the
slightest
resemblance
to
any
one
she
had
ever
seen
before
but
i
do
understand
she
protested
who
is
this
durgin
what
did
she
tell
you
to
say
to
me
she
said
her
patty
is
in
trouble
an
wants
ter
see
mag
of
the
alley
murmured
the
child
as
if
reciting
a
lesson
not
patty
murphy
cried
miss
kendall
starting
forward
and
grasping
the
child
arm
nellie
drew
back
half
frightened
yes
no
i
do
know
she
stammered
but
how
came
she
to
send
for
me
who
told
her
i
was
here
the
boss
the
boss
yes
mcginnis
ye
know
he
said
as
how
you
was
here
bobby
cried
miss
kendall
releasing
the
child
arm
and
falling
back
a
step
why
of
course
it
patty
it
must
be
patty
i
go
to
her
at
once
wait
here
while
i
dress
and
she
hurried
across
the
hall
and
up
the
broad
stairway
back
by
the
door
nellie
watched
the
disappearing
blue
draperies
with
wistful
eyes
that
bore
also
a
trace
of
resentment
go
and
dress
indeed
as
if
there
could
be
anything
more
altogether
to
be
desired
than
that
beautiful
trailing
blue
gown
she
was
even
more
dissatisfied
ten
minutes
later
when
miss
kendall
came
back
in
the
trim
brown
suit
and
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
delightful
to
usher
into
durgin
presence
that
sumptuous
robe
of
blue
she
forgot
her
disappointment
however
a
little
later
in
the
excitement
of
rolling
along
at
miss
kendall
side
in
the
hilcrest
carriage
with
the
coachman
in
the
spencer
livery
towering
above
her
on
the
seat
in
front
it
had
been
miss
kendall
first
thought
to
order
the
runabout
but
a
sudden
remembrance
of
her
morning
experience
a
few
weeks
before
caused
her
to
think
that
the
stalwart
john
and
the
horses
might
be
better
so
john
somewhat
to
his
consternation
it
must
be
confessed
had
been
summoned
to
take
his
orders
from
nellie
as
to
roads
and
turns
he
now
sat
stern
and
dignified
in
the
driver
seat
showing
by
the
very
lines
of
his
body
his
entire
disapproval
of
the
whole
affair
nor
were
john
and
betty
the
only
ones
at
hilcrest
who
were
conscious
of
keen
disapproval
that
morning
the
mistress
herself
from
an
upper
window
watched
with
dismayed
eyes
the
departure
of
the
carriage
i
found
patty
the
little
girl
who
was
so
good
to
me
in
new
york
margaret
had
explained
breathlessly
flying
into
the
room
three
minutes
before
she
in
trouble
and
has
sent
for
me
i
taking
john
and
the
horses
so
i
be
all
right
do
worry
and
with
that
she
was
gone
leaving
behind
her
a
woman
too
dazed
to
reply
by
so
much
as
a
word
hilcrest
was
not
out
of
sight
before
margaret
turned
to
the
child
at
her
side
you
said
she
was
in
trouble
my
friend
patty
what
is
it
she
questioned
it
little
maggie
she
sick

maggie
the
little
girl
in
the
pink
calico
dress
who
fell
down
almost
in
front
of
our
auto
nellie
turned
abruptly
her
thin
little
face
alight
gee
was
that
you
did

give
her
the
money

that
queer
then

margaret
and
to
think

about
her
what

the
matter
chapter

down
in
the
shabby
little
cottage
on
the
hill
road
durgin
walked
the
floor
vibrating
between
the
window
and
the
low
bed
in
the
corner
by
the
stove

magoon
mending
a
pair
of
trousers
and
talking
to
those

eyes
on
the
woman
who
was
anxiously
scanning
the
road
from
the
window
yes
i
know
murmured
durgin
resolutely
turning
her
back
on
the
window
and
going
over
to
the
bed
sixty
seconds
later
however
she
was
again
in
her
old
position
at
the
window
craning
her
neck
to
look
far
up
the
road
how
maggie
doin

but
mis
magoon
she
come
broke
off
durgin
and
something
in
her
face
and
voice
made
the
woman
by
the
stove
drop
her
work
and
run
to
the
window
drawn
up
before
the
gate
were
the
famous
span
of
thoroughbreds
prancing
arching
their
handsome
necks
and
apparently
giving
the
mighty
personage
on
the
driver
seat
all
that
he
wanted
to
do
to
hold
them
behind
in
the
luxurious
carriage
sat
a
ragged
little
girl
and
what
to
patty
durgin
was
a
wonderful
vision
in
golden
brown
durgin
was
thoroughly
frightened
she
had
summoned
this
glorious
creature
to
come
to
her
because
indeed
her
little
girl
maggie
was
sick
and
where
in
the
vision
before
her
was
there
a
trace
of
mag
of
the
alley
just
what
she
had
expected
to
see
durgin
did
not
know
but
certainly
not
this
and
she
fairly
shook
in
her
shoes
as
the
visible
evidence
of
her
audacity
in
the
shape
of
the
vision
in
golden
brown
walked
up
the
little
path
from
the
gate
it
was
magoon
who
had
to
go
to
the
door
the
young
woman
on
the
started
eagerly
forward
but
fell
back
with
a
murmured
oh
but
you
ca
be
patty
over
by
the
window
the
tall
woman
stirred
then
as
if
by
sheer
force
of
will
no
no
it
me
that
patty
she
began
hurriedly
an
i
oughter
sent
fur
ye
but
her
words
were
silenced
by
a
pair
of
arms
that
were
flung
around
her
neck
patty
it
is
patty
cried
an
eager
voice
and
durgin
found
herself
looking
into
the
blue
eyes
of
the
mag
of
the
alley
later
when
magoon
had
taken
herself
and
her
amazed
ejaculations
together
with
her
daughter
home
which
was
after
all
merely
the
other
side
of
the
shabby
little
house
patty
and
margaret
sat
down
to
talk
in
the
bed
in
the
corner
little
maggie
still
slept
and
they
lowered
their
voices
that
they
might
not
wake
her
now
tell
me
everything
commanded
margaret
i
want
to
know
everything
that
happened
patty
shook
her
head
thar
ai
much
an
what

interestin
she
said

but

patty
flushed
her
eyes
fell
yes
and
your
husband
he
living

margaret
hesitated
this
was
plainly
an
unpleasant
subject
yet
if
she
were
to
give
any
help
that
help
patty
saw
the
hesitation
and
divined
its
cause
you

she
said
miserably
he

be
left

retorted
margaret
brightly
and
at
the
cheery
tone
patty
raised
her
head
he
did
used
ter
be
left
out
once
when
i
married
him
eight
years
ago
she
declared
we

in
the
mill
both
of
us
an
done
well

patty
turned
her
eyes
away
all
the
animation
fled
from
her
face
and
left
it
gray
and
pinched
no
we
hai
been
here
but
two
years
we
jest
kind
of
drifted
here
from
the
last
place
we
do
never

in
one
place
and
the
twins
where
are
they
a
spasm
of
pain
tightened
patty
lips
i
do
know
she
said

at
first

whalens

a
painful
red
dyeing
her
cheeks
yes
i

said
margaret
gently
you
thought
we
had
forgotten
you
and
no
wonder
but
you
know
now
bobby
told
you
that
her
voice
broke
and
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
patty
nodded
her
eyes
averted
she
could
not
speak
those
years
afterward
were
never
very
clear
to
me
went
on
margaret
unsteadily
it
was
all
so
terrible
so
lonely
i
know
i
begged
to
go
back
to
the
alley
and
i
talked
of
you
and
the
others
constantly
but
they
kept
everything
from
me
they
never
spoke
of
those
years
in
new
york
and
they
surrounded
me
with
all
sorts
of
beautiful
interesting
things
and
did
everything
in
the
world
to
make
me
happy
in
time
they
succeeded
in
a
way
but
i
think
i
never
quite
forgot
there
was
always
something
somewhere
behind
things
yet
after
a
while
it
seemed
like
a
dream
or
like
a
life
that
some
one
else
had
lived
margaret
had
almost
forgotten
patty
presence
her
eyes
were
on
the
gate
out
the
window
and
her
voice
was
so
low
as
to
be
almost
inaudible
it
was
a
cry
from
little
maggie
that
roused
her
and
together
with
patty
she
sprang
toward
the
bed
my
lucky
stars
murmured
the
child
a
little
later
in
dim
recollection
as
she
gazed
into
the
visitor
face
you
precious
baby
and
it
shall
be
stars
you
see
cried
margaret
chapter
xxv
it
was
indeed
lucky
stars
as
little
maggie
soon
found
out
others
found
it
out
too
but
to
some
of
these
it
was
not
lucky
stars
at
the
dinner
table
on
that
first
night
after
the
visit
to
house
margaret
threw
the
family
into
no
little
consternation
by
abruptly
asking
how
do
you
go
to
work
to
get
men
and
things
to
put
houses
into
livable
shape
i
do
suppose
i
did
word
it
in
a
very
businesslike
manner
she
added
laughingly
in
response
to
frank
spencer
amazed
ejaculation
but
what
perhaps
i
do
quite
understand
he
murmured
no
of
course
you
do
replied
margaret
and
no
wonder
explain
you
see
i
found
another
of
my
friends
it
the
little
girl
patty
with
whom
i
lived
three
years
in
new
york
she
down
in
one
of
the
mill
cottages
and
it
leaks
and
is
in
bad
shape
generally
i
want
to
fix
it
up
there
was
a
dazed
silence
then
frank
spencer
recovered
his
wits
and
his
voice
by
all
means
he
rejoined
hastily
it
shall
be
attended
to
at
once
just
give
me
your
directions
and
i
will
send
the
men
around
there
right
away
thank
you
then
i
meet
them
there
and
tell
them
just
what
i
want
done
frank
spencer
moistened
his
lips
which
had
grown
unaccountably
dry
but
my
dear
margaret
he
remonstrated
surely
it
is
necessary
that
you
yourself
should
be
subjected
to
such
annoyance
i
can
attend
to
all
that
is
necessary
oh
but
i
do
mind
a
bit
returned
margaret
brightly
i
to
do
it
it
for
patty
you
know
and
frank
spencer
could
only
fall
back
in
his
chair
with
an
uneasy
glance
at
his
sister
before
the
week
was
out
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
many
things
that
were
for
patty
you
know
there
was
the
skilled
physician
summoned
to
prescribe
for
maggie
and
there
was
the
strong
capable
woman
hired
to
care
for
her
and
to
give
the
mother
a
much
needed
rest
there
were
the
large
baskets
of
fruit
and
vegetables
and
the
boxes
of
beautiful
flowers
in
fact
there
seemed
to
be
almost
nothing
throughout
the
whole
week
that
was
not
for
patty
you
know
even
margaret
time
that
too
was
given
to
patty
the
golf
links
and
the
tennis
court
were
deserted
neither
ned
nor
the
beautiful
october
weather
could
tempt
margaret
to
a
single
game
the
music
room
too
was
silent
and
the
piano
was
closed
down
in
the
little
house
on
the
prospect
hill
road
however
a
radiant
young
woman
was
superintending
the
work
that
was
fast
putting
the
cottage
into
a
shape
that
was
very
much
livable
meanwhile
this
same
radiant
young
woman
was
getting
acquainted
with
her
namesake
lucky
stars
as
the
child
insisted
upon
calling
her
and
maggie
were
firm
friends
good
food
and
proper
care
were
fast
bringing
the
little
girl
back
to
health
and
there
was
nothing
she
so
loved
to
do
as
to
play
with
the
beautiful
young
lady
who
had
never
yet
failed
to
bring
toy
or
game
or
flower
for
her
delight
and
how
old
are
you
now
margaret
would
laughingly
ask
each
day
just
to
hear
the
prompt
response
i
five
goin
on
six
an
i
be
twelve
margaret
always
chuckled
over
this
retort
and
never
tired
of
hearing
it
until
one
day
patty
sharply
interfered
do
please
do
i
ca
bear
it
when
you
do
half
know
what
it
means
when
i
do
know
what
it
means
why
patty
exclaimed
margaret
yes
it
sam
he
learned
it
to
her
well
margaret
eyes
were
still
puzzled
he
likes
it
he
her
ter
be
twelve
ye
know
explained
patty
with
an
effort
then
as
she
saw
her
meaning
was
still
not
clear
she
added
miserably
she
can
work
then
in
the
mills
in
the
mills
at
twelve
years
old
that
the
age
ye
know
when
they
can
git
their
papers
that
is
if
it
summer
vacation
time
an
they
looks
out
that
is
summer
most
generally
when
they
does
gits
after
that
it
do
count
they
jest
works
lots
of
summer
or
winter
school
or
no
school
the
age
do
you
mean
that
they
let
mere
children
twelve
years
old
work
in
those
mills
for
a
moment
patty
stared
silently
then
she
shook
her
head
i
reckon
mebbe
ye
do
know
much
about
it
she
said
wearily
they
do
wait
till
they
twelve
they
jest
says
they
twelve
nellie
magoon
eleven
an
bess
is
ten
an
susie
mcdermot
ai
but
nine
but
they
all

on
the
mill
books
sam
jest
maggie
ter
say
she
twelve
even
now
an
the
minute
she
big
enough
ter
work
she
will
be
twelve
it
makes
me
jest
sick
an
that
why
i
ca
bear
ter
hear
her
say
it
margaret
shuddered
her
face
lost
a
little
of
its
radiant
glow
and
her
hand
trembled
as
she
raised
it
to
her
head
you
are
right
i
did
not
know
she
said
faintly
there
must
be
something
that
can
be
done
there
be
i
will
see
and
she
did
see
that
night
she
once
more
followed
her
guardian
into
the
little
den
off
the
library
it
business
again
she
began
smiling
faintly
and
it
the
mills
may
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
of
course
you
may
cried
the
man
trying
to
make
his
voice
so
cordial
that
there
should
be
visible
in
his
manner
no
trace
of
his
real
dismay
at
her
request
what
is
it
margaret
did
not
answer
at
once
her
head
drooped
forward
a
little
she
had
seated
herself
near
the
desk
and
her
left
hand
and
arm
rested
along
the
edge
of
its
smooth
flat
top
the
man
gaze
drifted
from
her
face
to
the
arm
the
slender
wrist
and
the
tapering
fingers
so
clearly
outlined
in
all
their
fairness
against
the
dark
mahogany
and
so
plainly
all
unfitted
for
strife
or
struggle
with
a
sudden
movement
he
leaned
forward
and
covered
the
slim
fingers
with
his
own
hand
margaret
dear
child
do
he
begged
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
you
like
this
you
are
carrying
the
whole
world
on
those
two
frail
shoulders
of
yours
no
no
it
not
the
whole
world
at
all
protested
the
girl
only
a
wee
small
part
of
it
and
such
a
defenseless
little
part
too
it
the
children
down
at
the
mills
unconsciously
the
man
straightened
himself
his
clasp
on
the
outstretched
hand
loosened
until
margaret
as
if
in
answer
to
the
stern
determination
of
his
face
drew
her
hand
away
and
raised
her
head
until
her
eyes
met
his
unfalteringly
it
is
useless
of
course
to
pretend
not
to
understand
he
began
stiffly
i
suppose
that
that
altogether
too
officious
young
mcginnis
has
been
asking
your
help
for
some
of
his
pet
schemes
on
the
contrary
mcginnis
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
the
mill
workers
corrected
margaret
quietly
but
with
a
curious
little
thrill
that
resolved
itself
into
a
silent
exultation
that
there
was
then
at
least
one
at
the
mills
on
whose
aid
she
might
count
i
have
not
seen
him
indeed
since
that
first
morning
i
met
him
she
finished
coldly
though
margaret
would
not
own
it
to
herself
the
fact
that
she
had
not
seen
the
young
man
robert
mcginnis
had
surprised
and
disappointed
her
not
a
little
margaret
kendall
was
not
used
to
having
her
presence
and
her
gracious
invitations
ignored
oh
then
you
have
seen
him
murmured
her
guardian
and
there
was
a
curious
intonation
of
relief
in
his
voice
who
then
has
been
talking
to
you
no
one
in
the
way
you
mean
patty
inadvertently
mentioned
it
and
i
questioned
her
i
was
shocked
and
distressed
those
little
children
just
think
of
it
twelve
years
old
and
working
in
the
mills
the
man
made
a
troubled
gesture
but
my
dear
margaret
i
did
not
put
them
there
their
parents
did
it
but
you
could
refuse
to
take
them
why
should
i
he
shrugged
they
would
merely
go
into
some
other
mill
but
you
do
know
the
worst
of
it
moaned
the
girl
they
lied
to
you
they
are
even
twelve
some
of
them
they
babies
of
nine
and
ten
she
paused
expectantly
but
he
did
not
speak
he
only
turned
his
head
so
that
she
could
not
see
his
eyes
you
did
not
know
it
of
course
she
went
on
feverishly
but
you
do
now
and
surely
now
you
can
do
something
still
he
was
silent
then
he
turned
sharply
margaret
i
beg
of
you
to
believe
me
when
i
say
that
you
do
not
understand
the
matter
at
all
those
people
are
poor
they
need
the
money
you
would
deprive
some
of
the
families
of
of
their
means
of
support
if
you
took
away
what
the
children
earn
help
them
pity
them
be
as
charitable
as
you
like
that
is
well
and
good
but
margaret
do
for
heaven
sake
let
your
heart
run
away
with
your
head
when
it
comes
to
the
business
part
of
it
business
with
babies
nine
years
old
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
and
walked
twice
the
length
of
the
room
then
he
turned
about
and
faced
the
scornful
eyes
of
the
girl
by
the
desk
margaret
do
look
at
me
as
if
you
thought
i
was
a
fiend
incarnate
i
regret
this
sort
of
thing
as
much
as
you
do
indeed
i
do
but
my
hands
are
tied
i
am
simply
a
part
of
a
great
machine
a
gigantic
system
and
i
must
run
my
mills
as
other
men
do
surely
you
must
see
that
just
think
it
over
and
give
me
the
credit
at
least
for
knowing
a
little
more
of
the
business
than
you
do
when
i
and
my
father
before
me
have
been
here
as
many
years
as
you
have
days
come
please
do
let
us
talk
of
this
thing
any
more
you
are
tired
and
overwrought
and
i
think
you
realize
yourself
what
you
are
asking
very
well
i
will
go
sighed
margaret
rising
wearily
to
her
feet
but
i
ca
forget
it
there
must
be
some
way
out
of
it
there
must
be
some
way
out
of
it
somehow
some
time
chapter
xxvi
there
came
a
day
when
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
to
do
for
patty
maggie
was
well
and
at
play
again
in
the
tiny
yard
the
yard
itself
was
no
longer
strewn
with
tin
cans
and
bits
of
paper
nor
did
the
gate
hang
in
slovenly
decrepitude
the
house
rejoiced
in
new
paper
paint
and
and
the
roof
showed
a
spotted
surface
that
would
defy
the
heaviest
shower
within
before
a
cheery
fire
patty
sewed
industriously
on
garments
which
miss
kendall
no
wise
needed
but
for
which
miss
kendall
would
pay
much
money
patty
did
not
work
in
the
mills
now
margaret
had
refused
to
let
her
go
back
saying
that
she
wanted
lots
of
sewing
done
and
patty
could
do
that
instead
patty
own
wardrobe
as
well
as
that
of
the
child
maggie
was
supplied
for
a
year
ahead
and
the
pantry
and
the
storeroom
of
the
little
house
fairly
groaned
with
good
things
to
eat
even
sam
true
to
margaret
promise
was
not
left
out
as
was
shown
by
his
appearance
sam
stirred
by
the
girl
cheery
encouragement
and
tactful
confidence
held
up
his
head
sometimes
now
with
a
trace
of
his
old
manliness
and
had
even
been
known
to
keep
sober
for
two
whole
days
at
a
time
there
did
indeed
seem
nothing
left
to
do
for
patty
and
margaret
found
herself
with
the
old
idleness
on
her
hands
at
hilcrest
merideth
and
her
brothers
were
doing
everything
in
their
power
to
make
margaret
happy
they
were
frightened
and
dismayed
at
the
girl
infatuation
for
that
mill
woman
as
they
termed
interest
in
patty
and
they
had
ever
before
them
the
haunting
vision
of
the
girl
childhood
morbidness
which
they
so
feared
to
see
return
to
the
spencers
happiness
for
margaret
meant
pleasure
excitement
and
as
ned
expressed
it
something
doing
at
the
first
hint
then
of
leisure
on
the
part
of
margaret
these
three
vied
with
each
other
to
fill
that
leisure
to
the
brim
two
or
three
guests
were
invited
just
enough
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
familiar
faces
though
not
enough
to
spoil
the
intimacy
and
render
outside
interests
easy
it
was
december
and
too
late
for
picnics
but
it
was
yet
early
in
the
month
and
driving
and
motoring
were
still
possible
and
even
enjoyable
the
goal
now
was
not
a
lake
or
a
mountain
to
be
sure
but
might
be
a
not
too
distant
city
with
a
matinée
or
a
luncheon
to
give
zest
to
the
trip
ned
in
particular
was
indefatigable
in
his
efforts
to
please
and
margaret
could
scarcely
move
that
she
did
not
find
him
at
her
elbow
with
some
suggestion
for
her
gratification
ranging
all
the
way
from
a
to
a
footstool
margaret
was
not
quite
at
ease
about
ned
there
was
an
exclusiveness
in
his
devotions
and
a
tenderness
in
his
ministrations
that
made
her
a
little
restless
in
his
presence
particularly
if
she
found
herself
alone
with
him
ned
was
her
good
friend
her
comrade
she
was
very
sure
that
she
did
not
wish
him
to
be
anything
else
and
if
he
should
try
to
be
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
comradeship
at
all
events
if
not
to
the
friendship
by
way
of
defense
against
these
possibilities
she
adopted
a
playful
air
of
whimsicality
and
fell
to
calling
him
the
name
by
which
he
had
introduced
himself
on
that
first
day
when
she
had
seen
him
at
the
head
of
the
hillside
path
uncle
ned
she
did
not
do
this
many
times
however
for
one
day
he
turned
upon
her
a
white
face
working
with
emotion
i
am
not
your
uncle
he
burst
out
and
margaret
scarcely
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
he
threw
so
much
tragedy
into
the
simple
words
no
she
managed
to
return
lightly
oh
but
you
said
you
were
you
know
and
when
a
man
says
but
i
say
otherwise
now
he
cut
in
leaning
toward
her
until
his
breath
stirred
the
hair
at
her
temples
margaret
he
murmured
tremulously
it
not
but
there
something
else
a
name
that
oh
but
i
could
learn
another
interrupted
margaret
with
nervous
precipitation
as
she
rose
hurriedly
to
her
feet
so
soon
as
this
you
know
why
you
just
cast
me
off
as
a
niece
and
it
takes
time
for
me
to
realize
the
full
force
of
that
blow
she
finished
gayly
as
she
hurried
away
in
her
own
room
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
but
all
day
and
for
many
days
afterward
she
was
haunted
by
the
hurt
look
in
ned
eyes
as
she
had
turned
away
it
reminded
her
of
the
expression
she
had
seen
once
in
the
pictured
eyes
of
a
dog
that
had
been
painted
by
a
great
artist
she
remembered
too
the
title
of
the
picture
wounded
in
the
house
of
his
friends
and
it
distressed
her
not
a
little
and
yet
ned
was
her
comrade
and
her
very
good
friend
and
that
was
what
he
must
be
not
only
this
however
caused
margaret
restless
days
and
troubled
nights
there
were
those
children
down
in
the
mills
those
little
children
nine
ten
twelve
years
old
it
was
too
cold
now
to
stay
long
on
the
veranda
but
there
was
many
a
day
and
there
were
some
nights
when
margaret
looked
out
of
the
east
windows
of
hilcrest
and
gazed
with
fascinated
yet
shrinking
eyes
at
the
mills
she
was
growing
morbid
she
owned
that
to
herself
she
knew
nothing
at
all
of
the
mills
and
she
had
never
seen
a
child
at
work
in
them
yet
she
pictured
great
black
wheels
relentlessly
crushing
out
young
lives
and
she
recoiled
from
the
touch
of
her
trailing
silks
they
seemed
alive
with
shrunken
little
forms
and
wasted
fingers
day
after
day
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
the
most
visionary
projects
for
stopping
those
wheels
or
for
removing
those
children
beyond
their
reach
even
though
her
eyes
might
be
on
the
merry
throngs
of
a
gay
city
street
her
thoughts
were
still
back
in
the
mill
town
with
the
children
and
even
though
her
body
might
be
flying
from
home
at
the
rate
of
thirty
or
forty
miles
an
hour
in
frank
big
speeder
her
real
self
was
back
at
hilcrest
with
the
mills
always
in
sight
once
again
she
appealed
to
her
guardian
but
five
minutes
talk
showed
her
the
uselessness
of
anything
she
could
say
it
was
true
she
did
not
anything
about
it
it
was
that
very
fact
perhaps
which
first
sent
her
thoughts
in
a
new
direction
if
as
was
true
she
did
not
know
anything
about
it
how
better
could
she
remedy
the
situation
than
by
finding
out
something
about
it
and
almost
instantly
came
the
memory
of
her
guardian
words
i
suppose
that
that
altogether
too
officious
young
mcginnis
has
been
asking
your
help
for
some
of
his
schemes
bobby
knew
bobby
had
schemes
bobby
was
the
one
to
help
her
by
all
means
she
would
send
for
bobby
that
night
in
a
cramped
little
room
in
one
of
the
mill
a
young
man
received
a
note
that
sent
the
blood
in
a
tide
of
red
to
his
face
and
made
his
hands
shake
until
the
paper
in
his
long
sinewy
fingers
fluttered
like
an
aspen
leaf
in
a
breeze
yet
the
note
was
very
simple
it
read
will
you
come
please
to
see
me
night
i
want
to
ask
some
questions
about
the
children
at
the
mills
and
it
was
signed
margaret
kendall
chapter
xxvii
with
a
relief
which
she
did
not
attempt
to
hide
from
herself
margaret
saw
the
male
members
of
the
family
at
hilcrest
leave
early
the
next
morning
on
a
trip
from
which
they
could
not
return
until
the
next
day
and
with
a
reluctance
which
she
could
not
hide
from
either
herself
or
merideth
she
said
that
afternoon
mcginnis
is
coming
to
see
me
this
evening
aunt
della
i
sent
for
him
you
know
i
am
interested
in
the
children
at
the
mills
and
i
wanted
to
ask
him
some
questions
merideth
was
dumb
with
dismay
for
some
days
margaret
apparent
inactivity
had
lulled
her
into
a
feeling
of
security
and
now
with
her
brothers
away
the
blow
which
they
had
so
dreaded
for
weeks
had
fallen
mcginnis
was
coming
summoning
all
her
strength
merideth
finally
managed
to
murmur
a
faint
remonstrance
that
margaret
should
trouble
herself
over
a
matter
that
could
not
be
helped
then
with
an
earnest
request
that
margaret
should
not
commit
herself
to
any
foolish
promises
she
fled
to
her
own
room
fearful
lest
in
her
perturbation
she
should
say
something
which
she
would
afterward
regret
when
miss
kendall
came
at
eight
that
night
she
found
waiting
for
her
in
the
into
which
mcginnis
had
been
shown
by
her
express
orders
a
young
man
whose
dress
attitude
and
expression
radiated
impersonality
and
business
in
spite
of
his
sumptuous
surroundings
in
directing
that
the
young
man
should
be
shown
into
the
instead
of
into
the
more
informal
library
or
margaret
had
vaguely
intended
to
convey
to
him
the
impression
that
he
was
a
friend
and
as
such
was
entitled
to
all
honor
but
she
had
scarcely
looked
into
the
cold
gray
eyes
or
touched
the
extended
fingers
before
she
knew
that
all
such
efforts
had
been
without
avail
the
young
man
had
not
come
to
pay
a
visit
he
was
an
employee
who
had
obeyed
the
command
of
one
in
authority
mcginnis
stood
just
inside
the
door
hat
in
hand
his
face
was
white
and
his
jaw
his
manner
was
quiet
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
steady
there
was
nothing
about
him
to
tell
the
girl
who
was
vainly
trying
to
thaw
the
stiff
frigidity
of
his
reserve
that
he
had
spent
all
day
and
half
the
night
in
lashing
himself
into
just
this
manner
that
so
displeased
her
you
sent
for
me
he
asked
quietly
yes
smiled
the
girl
and
does
your
conscience
prick
you
sir
because
i
to
send
for
you
when
you
should
have
come
long
ago
of
your
own
accord
to
see
me
she
demanded
playfully
motioning
him
to
a
seat
then
before
he
could
reply
she
went
on
hurriedly
i
wanted
to
see
you
very
much
by
something
that
spencer
said
the
other
evening
i
suspected
that
you
were
interested
in
the
children
who
work
in
the
mills
particularly
interested
and
you
are
yes
much
interested
and
you
know
them
lots
of
them
you
know
their
parents
and
how
they
live
yes
i
know
them
well
too
well
he
added
the
last
softly
almost
involuntarily
the
girl
heard
and
threw
a
quick
look
of
sympathy
into
his
eyes
good
you
are
just
the
one
i
want
then
she
cried
and
you
will
help
me
wo
you
mcginnis
hesitated
an
eager
light
had
leaped
to
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
dared
not
speak
lest
his
voice
break
through
the
lines
of
stern
control
he
had
set
for
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
you
any
help
i
can
he
said
at
last
steadily
but
spencer
of
course
knows
he
paused
leaving
his
sentence
unfinished
but
that
is
exactly
it
interposed
margaret
earnestly
spencer
does
not
know
at
least
he
does
not
know
personally
about
the
mill
people
i
mean
he
told
me
long
ago
that
you
stood
between
him
and
them
and
had
for
a
long
time
it
is
you
who
must
tell
me
very
well
i
will
do
my
best
just
what
do
you
want
to
know
everything
and
i
want
not
only
to
be
told
but
to
see
for
myself
i
want
you
to
take
me
through
the
mills
and
afterward
i
want
to
visit
some
of
the
houses
where
the
children
live
miss
kendall
the
distressed
consternation
in
the
man
voice
was
unmistakable
is
it
so
bad
as
that
questioned
the
girl
you
do
want
me
to
see
all
these
things
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
then
if
conditions
are
bad
help
is
needed
but
before
help
can
be
effectual
or
even
given
at
all
the
conditions
must
be
understood
that
is
what
i
mean
to
do
understand
the
conditions
how
many
children
are
there
employed
in
the
mills
please
mcginnis
hesitated
well
there
are
some
hundreds
he
acknowledged
of
course
many
of
them
are
twelve
and
fourteen
and
fifteen
and
that
is
bad
enough
but
there
are
others
younger
you
see
the
age
limit
of
this
state
is
lower
than
some
many
parents
bring
their
children
here
to
live
so
that
they
can
put
them
into
the
mills
margaret
shuddered
then
it
is
true
as
patty
said
there
are
children
there
nine
and
ten
years
old
yes
even
younger
than
that
i
fear
only
last
week
i
turned
away
a
man
who
brought
a
puny
little
thing
with
a
request
for
work
he
swore
she
was
twelve
i
hate
to
tell
you
how
old
or
rather
how
young
she
really
looked
i
sent
him
home
with
a
few
remarks
which
i
hope
he
will
remember
she
was
only
one
however
out
of
many
i
am
not
always
able
to
do
what
i
would
like
to
do
in
such
cases
i
am
not
the
only
man
at
the
mills
you
must
realize
that
yes
i
realize
it
and
i
understand
why
you
ca
always
do
what
you
wish
but
just
suppose
you
tell
me
now
some
of
the
things
you
would
like
to
do
if
you
could
and
she
smiled
encouragement
straight
into
his
eyes
until
in
spite
of
his
stern
resolve
he
forgot
himself
and
his
surroundings
and
began
to
talk
robert
mcginnis
was
no
orator
but
he
knew
his
subject
and
his
heart
was
in
it
for
long
months
he
had
been
battling
alone
against
the
evils
that
had
little
by
little
filled
his
soul
with
horror
accustomed
heretofore
only
to
rebuffs
and
angry
denunciations
of
his
officious
meddling
he
now
suddenly
found
a
tenderly
sympathetic
ear
eagerly
awaiting
his
story
and
a
pair
of
luminous
blue
eyes
already
glistening
with
unshed
tears
no
wonder
mcginnis
talked
and
talked
well
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
the
maggie
of
long
ago
the
little
girl
who
stood
ready
and
anxious
to
divvy
up
with
all
the
world
then
suddenly
his
eyes
fell
on
the
rich
folds
of
the
girl
dress
and
on
the
velvety
pile
of
the
rug
beneath
her
feet
i
have
said
too
much
he
broke
off
sharply
springing
to
his
feet
i
forgot
myself
on
the
contrary
you
have
not
said
half
enough
declared
the
girl
rising
too
and
i
mean
to
go
over
the
mills
at
once
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
take
me
i
let
you
know
when
and
come
to
see
me
again
please
without
being
sent
for
she
suggested
merrily
adding
with
a
pretty
touch
of
earnestness
we
are
a
committee
of
two
and
to
do
good
work
the
committee
must
meet
mcginnis
never
knew
exactly
how
he
got
home
that
night
the
earth
was
beneath
him
but
he
did
not
seem
to
touch
it
the
sky
was
above
him
he
was
nearer
that
but
in
spite
of
this
nearness
the
stars
seemed
dim
he
was
thinking
of
the
light
in
a
pair
of
glorious
blue
eyes
mcginnis
told
himself
that
it
was
because
of
his
mill
people
this
elation
that
possessed
him
he
was
grateful
that
they
had
found
a
friend
he
did
not
ask
himself
later
whether
it
was
also
because
of
his
mill
people
that
he
sat
up
until
far
into
the
morning
with
his
eyes
dreamily
fixed
on
the
note
in
his
hand
signed
margaret
kendall
chapter
xxviii
frank
spencer
found
the
mental
atmosphere
of
hilcrest
in
confusion
when
he
returned
from
his
two
days
trip
margaret
had
repeated
to
merideth
the
substance
of
what
mcginnis
had
told
her
drawing
a
vivid
picture
of
the
little
children
wearing
out
their
lives
in
plain
sight
of
the
windows
of
hilcrest
merideth
had
been
shocked
and
dismayed
though
she
hardly
knew
which
she
deplored
the
more
that
such
conditions
existed
or
that
margaret
should
know
of
them
at
margaret
avowed
determination
to
go
over
the
mills
and
into
the
operatives
houses
she
lifted
her
hands
in
horrified
protest
and
begged
her
to
report
the
matter
to
the
woman
guild
and
leave
the
whole
thing
in
charge
of
the
committee
but
do
you
see
that
they
ca
reach
the
seat
of
the
trouble
margaret
had
objected
why
even
that
money
which
i
intended
for
little
maggie
went
into
a
general
fund
and
never
reached
its
specified
destination
and
merideth
could
only
sigh
and
murmur
but
my
dear
it
so
unnecessary
and
so
dreadful
for
you
to
mix
yourself
up
personally
with
such
people
when
her
brother
came
home
merideth
went
to
him
frank
was
a
man
surely
frank
could
do
something
but
frank
merely
grew
white
and
stern
and
went
off
into
his
own
den
shutting
himself
up
away
from
everybody
the
next
morning
after
a
fifteen
minute
talk
with
margaret
he
sought
his
sister
his
face
was
drawn
into
deep
lines
and
his
eyes
looked
as
if
he
had
not
slept
say
no
more
to
margaret
he
entreated
it
is
useless
she
is
her
own
mistress
of
course
in
spite
of
her
insistence
that
i
am
still
her
guardian
and
she
must
be
allowed
to
do
as
she
likes
in
this
matter
make
her
home
here
happy
and
do
not
trouble
her
we
must
not
make
her
quite
hate
us
his
voice
broke
over
the
last
two
words
and
he
was
gone
before
merideth
could
make
any
reply
some
hours
later
young
mcginnis
at
the
mills
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
if
you
are
not
too
busy
called
a
voice
that
sent
a
quick
throb
of
joy
to
the
young
man
pulse
the
other
half
of
the
committee
would
like
to
begin
work
may
she
come
down
to
the
mills
this
afternoon
at
three
by
all
means
cried
mcginnis
come
he
tried
to
say
more
but
while
he
was
searching
for
just
the
right
words
the
voice
murmured
thank
you
and
then
came
the
click
of
the
receiver
against
the
hook
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
the
clock
had
not
struck
three
that
afternoon
when
margaret
was
ushered
into
the
inner
office
of
spencer
spencer
only
frank
was
there
for
which
margaret
was
thankful
she
avoided
ned
these
days
when
she
could
there
was
still
that
haunting
reproach
in
his
eyes
whenever
they
met
hers
frank
was
expecting
her
and
only
a
peculiar
tightening
of
his
lips
betrayed
his
disquietude
as
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
pressed
the
button
that
would
summon
mcginnis
to
the
office
miss
kendall
would
like
to
go
over
one
of
the
mills
he
said
quietly
as
the
young
man
entered
in
response
to
his
ring
perhaps
you
will
be
her
escort
margaret
gave
her
guardian
a
grateful
look
as
she
left
the
office
she
thought
she
knew
just
how
much
the
calm
acceptance
of
the
situation
had
cost
him
and
she
appreciated
his
unflinching
determination
to
give
her
actions
the
sanction
of
his
apparent
consent
it
was
for
this
that
she
gave
him
the
grateful
glance
but
he
did
not
see
it
his
head
was
turned
away
and
what
shall
i
show
you
asked
mcginnis
as
the
office
door
closed
behind
them
everything
you
can
returned
margaret
everything
but
particularly
the
children
from
the
first
deafening
of
the
rattling
machines
she
drew
back
in
consternation
they
do
work
there
the
children
she
cried
for
answer
he
pointed
to
a
little
girl
not
far
away
she
was
standing
on
a
stool
that
she
might
reach
her
work
her
face
was
thin
and
drawn
looking
with
deep
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
little
hollows
where
the
roses
should
have
been
in
her
cheeks
her
hair
was
braided
and
wound
tightly
about
her
small
head
though
at
the
temples
and
behind
her
ears
it
kinked
into
rebellious
curls
that
showed
what
it
would
like
to
do
if
it
had
a
chance
her
ragged
little
skirts
were
bound
round
and
round
with
a
stout
cord
so
that
the
hungry
jaws
of
the
machine
might
not
snap
at
any
flying
fold
or
tatter
she
did
not
look
up
as
margaret
paused
beside
her
she
dared
not
her
eyes
were
glued
to
the
whizzing
whirring
clattering
thing
before
her
watching
for
broken
threads
or
loose
ends
the
neglect
of
which
might
bring
down
upon
her
head
a
snarling
reprimand
from
de
boss
of
her
department
margaret
learned
many
things
during
the
next
two
hours
conversation
was
not
easy
in
the
clattering
din
but
some
few
things
her
guide
explained
and
a
word
or
two
spoke
volumes
sometimes
she
saw
what
it
meant
to
be
a
doffer
a
reeler
a
she
saw
what
it
might
mean
if
the
tiny
hand
that
thrust
the
empty
bobbin
over
the
buzzing
should
slip
or
lose
its
skill
she
saw
a
little
maid
of
twelve
who
earned
two
whole
dollars
a
week
and
she
saw
a
smaller
girl
of
ten
who
mcginnis
said
was
with
her
sister
the
only
support
of
an
invalid
mother
at
home
she
saw
more
much
more
until
her
mind
refused
to
grasp
details
and
the
whole
scene
became
one
blurred
vision
of
horror
later
after
a
brief
rest
she
had
insisted
upon
staying
she
saw
the
swarm
out
into
the
chill
december
night
and
the
come
shivering
in
to
take
their
places
and
she
grew
faint
and
sick
when
she
saw
among
them
the
scores
of
puny
little
forms
with
faces
and
dragging
feet
and
they
only
beginning
she
moaned
as
mcginnis
hurried
her
away
and
they
got
to
work
all
night
all
night
chapter
xxix
margaret
did
not
sleep
well
in
her
sheets
that
night
always
she
heard
the
roar
and
the
of
the
mills
and
everywhere
she
saw
the
weary
little
workers
with
their
skirts
and
their
strained
anxious
faces
she
came
down
to
breakfast
with
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
and
she
ate
almost
nothing
to
the
great
though
silent
distress
of
the
family
the
spencers
were
alone
now
there
would
be
no
more
guests
for
a
week
then
would
come
a
merry
for
the
christmas
holidays
new
year
was
the
signal
for
a
general
breaking
up
the
family
seldom
stayed
at
hilcrest
long
after
that
though
the
house
was
not
quite
closed
being
always
in
readiness
for
the
brothers
when
either
one
or
both
came
down
for
a
week
business
it
was
always
more
or
less
of
a
debatable
question
just
where
the
family
should
go
there
was
the
town
house
in
new
york
frequently
opened
for
a
month
or
two
of
gaiety
and
there
were
the
allurements
of
some
southern
resort
or
of
a
trip
abroad
to
be
considered
sometimes
it
was
merely
a
succession
of
visits
that
occupied
the
first
few
weeks
after
new
year
particularly
for
merideth
and
ned
and
sometimes
it
was
only
a
quiet
rest
under
some
sunny
sky
entirely
away
from
society
with
a
capital
the
time
was
drawing
near
now
for
the
annual
change
and
the
family
were
discussing
the
various
possibilities
when
margaret
came
into
the
they
appealed
to
her
at
once
and
asked
her
opinion
and
advice
but
without
avail
there
seemed
to
be
not
one
plan
that
interested
her
to
the
point
of
possessing
either
merits
or
demerits
i
am
going
down
to
patty
she
said
a
little
hurriedly
to
merideth
when
breakfast
was
over
i
got
some
names
and
addresses
of
the
mill
children
yesterday
from
mcginnis
and
i
shall
ask
patty
to
go
with
me
to
see
them
i
want
to
talk
with
the
parents
but
my
dear
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
protested
merideth
they
are
so
rough
those
people
miss
alby
our
visiting
home
missionary
told
me
only
last
week
how
dreadful
they
were
so
rude
and
intemperate
and
and
she
has
been
among
them
she
knows
yes
but
do
you
see
those
are
the
very
people
that
need
help
then
returned
margaret
wearily
they
do
know
what
they
are
doing
to
their
little
children
and
i
must
tell
them
i
tell
them
i
shall
have
patty
with
me
do
worry
and
merideth
could
only
sigh
and
sigh
again
and
hurry
away
to
devise
an
altogether
more
delightful
plan
for
the
winter
months
than
any
that
had
yet
been
proposed
a
plan
so
overwhelmingly
delightful
that
margaret
could
not
help
being
interested
of
one
thing
however
merideth
was
certain
if
there
was
a
place
distant
enough
to
silence
the
roar
of
the
mills
in
margaret
ears
that
place
should
be
chosen
if
it
were
egypt
itself
patty
durgin
hesitated
visibly
when
margaret
told
her
what
she
wanted
to
do
until
margaret
exclaimed
in
surprise
and
with
a
little
reproach
in
her
voice
why
patty
do
you
want
to
help
me
yes
yes
you
do
understand
protested
patty
it
ai
that
i
want
ter
do
it
all
if
you
have
money
for
let
me
give
it
to
margaret
was
silent
her
eyes
were
still
hurt
still
rebellious
i
i
do
want
you
ter
see
them
stammered
patty
then
i
do
want
you
ter
feel
so
so
bad
margaret
face
cleared
oh
but
i
feeling
bad
now
she
asserted
cheerily
and
after
i
see
them
i
feel
better
i
want
to
talk
to
them
do
you
see
they
realize
what
they
are
doing
to
their
children
to
let
them
work
so
and
i
am
going
to
tell
them
patty
sighed
ye
do
understand
she
began
then
stopped
her
eyes
on
the
determined
young
face
opposite
all
right
i
go
she
finished
but
she
shivered
a
little
as
she
spoke
and
they
did
go
not
only
on
that
day
but
on
the
next
and
the
next
margaret
almost
forgot
the
mills
so
filled
was
her
vision
with
drunken
men
untidy
women
wretched
babies
and
cheerless
homes
sometimes
her
presence
and
her
questions
were
resented
and
always
they
were
looked
upon
with
distrust
her
money
if
she
gave
that
was
welcome
usually
but
her
remonstrances
and
her
warnings
fell
upon
deaf
if
not
angry
ears
and
then
margaret
perceived
why
patty
had
said
she
did
not
understand
there
was
no
such
thing
as
making
a
successful
appeal
to
the
parents
she
might
have
spared
herself
the
effort
sometimes
she
did
not
understand
the
words
of
the
men
and
the
slovenly
women
there
were
many
nationalities
among
the
operatives
but
always
she
understood
their
black
looks
and
their
almost
threatening
gestures
occasionally
to
be
sure
she
found
a
sick
woman
or
a
discouraged
man
who
welcomed
her
warmly
and
who
listened
to
her
and
agreed
with
what
she
had
to
say
but
with
them
there
was
always
the
excuse
of
poverty
though
their
sue
and
bess
and
teddy
might
not
earn
but
twenty
thirty
forty
cents
a
day
yet
that
twenty
thirty
and
forty
cents
would
buy
meat
and
bread
and
meant
all
the
difference
between
a
full
and
an
empty
stomach
perhaps
for
every
member
of
the
family
at
times
margaret
did
what
she
could
she
spent
her
time
and
her
money
without
stint
and
went
from
house
to
house
untiringly
she
summoned
young
mcginnis
to
her
aid
and
arranged
for
a
monster
christmas
tree
to
be
placed
in
the
largest
hall
in
town
and
she
herself
ordered
the
books
toys
candies
and
games
for
it
besides
the
candles
and
tinsel
stars
to
make
it
a
vision
of
delight
to
the
weary
little
eyes
all
unaccustomed
to
such
glory
and
yet
to
margaret
it
seemed
that
nothing
that
she
did
counted
in
the
least
against
the
much
there
was
to
be
done
it
was
as
if
a
child
with
a
teaspoon
and
a
bowl
of
sand
were
set
to
filling
up
a
big
chasm
her
spoonful
of
sand
had
not
even
struck
bottom
in
that
pit
of
horror
chapter
xxx
the
at
hilcrest
was
not
an
entire
success
that
christmas
even
the
guests
felt
a
subtle
something
in
the
air
that
was
not
conducive
to
ease
while
merideth
and
her
brothers
were
plainly
fighting
a
losing
contest
against
a
restlessness
that
sent
a
haunting
fear
to
their
eyes
margaret
though
scrupulously
careful
to
show
every
attention
to
the
guests
that
courtesy
demanded
was
strangely
quiet
and
not
at
all
like
the
merry
girl
that
most
of
them
knew
brandon
who
was
again
at
the
house
sought
her
out
one
day
and
said
low
in
her
ear
if
it
were
june
and
not
december
and
if
we
were
out
in
the
auto
instead
of
here
by
the
fire
i
wondering
would
i
need
to
watch
out
for
those
brakes
the
girl
winced
no
no
she
cried
never
i
think
i
should
simply
crawl
for
fear
that
under
the
wheels
somewhere
would
be
a
child
a
dog
a
chicken
or
even
a
helpless
worm
something
that
moved
and
that
i
might
hurt
there
is
already
so
much
suffering
brandon
laughed
uneasily
and
drew
back
a
puzzled
frown
on
his
face
he
had
not
meant
that
she
should
take
his
jest
so
seriously
it
was
on
the
day
after
new
year
when
all
the
guests
had
gone
that
margaret
once
more
said
to
her
guardian
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
and
on
business
frank
spencer
told
himself
that
he
was
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
now
and
that
he
was
resigned
to
the
inevitable
but
his
eyes
were
troubled
and
his
lips
were
as
he
motioned
the
girl
to
precede
him
into
the
den
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
began
plunging
into
her
subject
with
an
abruptness
that
betrayed
her
nervousness
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
that
i
i
can
not
go
with
you
when
you
all
go
away
next
week
you
can
not
go
with
us
no
i
must
stay
here
here
why
margaret
child
that
is
impossible
here
in
this
great
house
with
only
the
servants
no
no
you
do
understand
not
here
at
hilcrest
i
shall
be
down
in
the
town
with
patty
margaret
the
man
was
too
dismayed
to
say
more
i
know
it
seems
strange
to
you
of
course
rejoined
the
girl
hastily
but
you
will
see
you
will
understand
when
i
explain
i
have
thought
of
it
in
all
its
bearings
and
it
is
the
only
way
i
could
not
go
with
you
and
sing
and
laugh
and
dance
and
all
the
while
remember
that
my
people
back
here
were
suffering
your
people
dear
child
they
are
not
your
people
nor
my
people
they
are
their
own
people
they
come
and
go
as
they
like
if
not
in
my
mills
they
work
in
some
other
man
mills
you
are
not
responsible
for
their
welfare
besides
you
have
already
done
more
for
their
comfort
and
happiness
than
any
human
being
could
expect
of
you
i
know
but
you
do
not
understand
it
is
in
a
peculiar
way
that
they
are
my
people
not
because
they
are
here
but
because
they
are
poor
and
unhappy
margaret
hesitated
and
then
went
on
her
eyes
turned
away
from
her
guardian
face
i
do
know
as
i
can
make
you
understand
as
i
do
there
are
people
lots
of
them
who
are
generous
and
kind
to
the
poor
but
they
are
on
one
side
of
the
line
and
the
poor
are
on
the
other
they
merely
pass
things
over
the
line
they
never
go
themselves
and
that
is
all
right
they
could
not
cross
the
line
if
they
wanted
to
perhaps
they
would
not
know
how
all
their
lives
they
have
been
surrounded
with
tender
care
and
luxury
they
do
not
know
what
it
means
to
be
hungry
and
cold
and
homeless
they
do
not
know
what
it
means
to
fight
the
world
alone
with
only
empty
hands
margaret
paused
her
eyes
still
averted
then
suddenly
she
turned
and
faced
the
man
sitting
in
silent
dismay
at
the
desk
do
you
see
she
cried
i
crossed
the
line
i
crossed
it
long
ago
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
do
know
what
it
means
to
be
hungry
and
cold
and
homeless
i
do
know
what
it
means
to
fight
the
world
with
only
two
small
empty
hands
in
doing
for
these
people
i
am
doing
for
my
own
they
are
my
people
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
little
room
to
the
man
at
the
desk
the
bottom
seemed
suddenly
to
have
dropped
out
of
his
world
for
some
time
it
had
been
growing
on
him
the
knowledge
of
how
much
the
presence
of
this
winsome
girl
meant
to
him
it
came
to
him
now
with
the
staggering
force
of
a
blow
in
the
face
and
she
was
going
away
to
frank
spencer
the
days
suddenly
stretched
ahead
in
empty
uselessness
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
worth
while
but
my
dear
margaret
he
said
at
last
unsteadily
we
tried
we
all
tried
to
make
you
forget
those
terrible
days
you
were
so
keenly
sensitive
they
weighed
too
heavily
on
your
heart
you
you
were
morbid
my
dear
i
know
she
said
i
understand
better
now
every
one
tried
to
interest
me
to
amuse
me
to
make
me
forget
i
was
kept
from
everything
unpleasant
and
from
everybody
that
suffered
it
comes
to
me
very
vividly
now
how
careful
every
one
was
that
i
should
know
of
only
happiness
we
wanted
you
to
forget
but
i
never
did
forget
quite
even
when
years
and
years
had
passed
and
i
could
go
everywhere
and
see
all
the
beautiful
things
and
places
i
had
read
about
and
when
i
was
with
my
friends
there
was
always
something
somewhere
behind
things
those
four
years
in
new
york
were
vague
and
elusive
as
time
passed
they
seemed
like
a
dream
or
like
a
life
that
some
one
else
had
lived
but
i
know
now
they
were
not
a
dream
and
they
were
not
a
life
that
some
one
else
lived
they
were
my
life
i
lived
them
myself
do
you
see
now
margaret
eyes
were
luminous
with
feeling
her
lips
trembled
but
her
face
glowed
with
a
strange
exaltation
of
happiness
but
what
do
you
mean
to
do
faltered
the
man
margaret
flushed
and
leaned
forward
eagerly
i
am
going
to
do
all
that
i
can
and
i
hope
it
will
be
a
great
deal
i
am
going
down
there
to
live
to
live
not
to
live
child
yes
oh
i
now
she
went
on
hurriedly
i
have
been
among
them
some
are
wicked
and
some
are
thoughtless
but
all
of
them
need
teaching
i
am
going
to
live
there
among
them
to
show
them
the
better
way
the
man
at
the
desk
left
his
chair
abruptly
he
walked
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
moon
shone
clear
and
bright
in
the
sky
down
in
the
valley
the
countless
gleaming
windows
and
the
tall
black
chimneys
showed
where
the
still
toiled
those
whom
the
man
had
come
almost
to
hate
it
was
because
of
them
that
margaret
was
going
he
turned
slowly
and
walked
back
to
the
girl
margaret
he
began
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
i
had
not
thought
to
speak
of
this
at
least
not
now
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
never
spoke
of
it
but
i
am
almost
forced
to
say
it
now
i
ca
let
you
go
like
this
and
not
know
i
must
make
one
effort
to
keep
you
if
you
knew
that
there
was
some
one
here
who
loved
you
who
loved
you
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
being
and
if
you
knew
that
to
him
your
going
meant
everything
that
was
loneliness
and
grief
would
you
could
you
stay
margaret
started
she
would
not
look
into
the
eyes
that
were
so
earnestly
seeking
hers
it
was
of
ned
of
course
that
he
was
speaking
of
that
she
was
sure
in
some
way
he
had
discovered
ned
feeling
for
her
had
perhaps
even
been
asked
to
plead
his
cause
with
her
did
you
ever
think
began
spencer
again
softly
did
you
ever
think
that
if
you
did
stay
you
might
find
even
here
some
one
to
whom
you
could
show
the
better
way
that
even
here
you
might
do
all
these
things
you
long
to
do
and
with
some
one
close
by
your
side
to
help
you
margaret
thought
of
ned
of
his
impulsiveness
his
his
utter
want
of
sympathy
with
everything
she
had
been
doing
the
last
few
weeks
and
involuntarily
she
shuddered
spencer
saw
the
sensitive
quiver
and
drew
back
touched
to
the
quick
margaret
struggled
to
her
feet
no
no
she
cried
still
refusing
to
meet
his
eyes
i
i
can
not
stay
i
am
sorry
believe
me
to
give
you
pain
but
i
i
can
not
stay
and
she
hurried
from
the
room
the
man
dropped
back
in
his
chair
his
face
white
she
does
not
love
me
and
no
wonder
he
sighed
bitterly
and
he
went
over
word
by
word
what
had
been
said
though
even
then
he
did
not
find
syllable
or
gesture
that
told
him
the
truth
that
she
supposed
him
merely
to
be
playing
john
alden
to
his
brother

chapter
xxxi
the
household
at
hilcrest
did
not
break
up
as
early
as
usual
that
year
a
few
days
were
consumed
in
horrified
remonstrances
and
tearful
pleadings
on
the
part
of
merideth
and
ned
when
margaret
plans
became
known
then
several
more
days
were
needed
for
necessary
arrangements
when
the
stoical
calm
of
despair
had
brought
something
like
peace
to
the
family
it
is
not
so
dreadful
at
all
margaret
had
assured
them
i
have
taken
a
large
house
not
far
from
the
mills
and
i
am
having
it
papered
and
painted
and
put
into
very
comfortable
shape
patty
and
her
family
will
live
with
me
and
we
are
going
to
open
classes
in
simple
little
things
that
will
help
toward
better
living
but
that
is
regular
settlement
work
sighed
merideth
is
it
smiled
margaret
a
little
wearily
well
perhaps
it
is
anyway
i
hope
that
just
the
presence
of
one
clean
beautiful
home
among
them
will
do
some
good
i
mean
to
try
it
at
all
events
but
are
you
going
to
do
nothing
but
that
all
the
time
just
teach
those
dreadful
creatures
and
and
live
there
certainly
not
declared
margaret
with
a
bright
smile
i
planned
a
trip
to
new
york
to
new
york
merideth
sat
up
suddenly
her
face
alight
oh
that
will
be
fine
lovely
why
did
you
tell
us
poor
dear
you
need
a
rest
all
right
i
thinking
and
we
keep
you
just
as
long
as
we
can
too
with
lightning
rapidity
merideth
had
changed
their
plans
in
her
mind
they
would
go
to
new
york
not
egypt
egypt
had
seemed
desirable
but
if
margaret
was
going
to
new
york
that
altered
the
case
oh
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
new
york
laughed
margaret
besides
i
going
with
patty
with
patty
if
it
had
not
been
tragical
it
would
have
been
comical
merideth
shocked
recoil
at
the
girl
words
yes
after
we
get
everything
nicely
to
running
we
shall
have
teachers
to
help
us
you
know
patty
and
i
are
going
to
new
york
to
see
if
we
ca
find
her
sisters
arabella
and
clarabella
what
absurd
names
merideth
spoke
sharply
in
reality
she
had
no
interest
whether
they
were
or
were
not
absurd
but
they
chanced
at
the
moment
to
be
a
convenient
scapegoat
for
her
anger
and
discomfiture
patty
does
think
them
absurd
laughed
margaret
she
would
tell
you
that
she
named
them
herself
out
of
a
of
a
book
she
found
in
the
ash
barrel
long
ago
when
they
were
children
you
should
hear
patty
say
it
really
to
appreciate
it
she
used
to
preface
it
by
some
such
remark
as
ai
like
measles
an
relations
ye
know
ye
do
have
ter
have
if
ye
do
want
you
can
change
ugh
shuddered
merideth
margaret
how
can
you
laugh
why
it
funny
i
think
laughed
margaret
again
as
she
turned
away
even
the
most
urgent
entreaties
on
the
part
of
margaret
failed
to
start
the
spencers
on
their
trip
and
not
until
she
finally
threatened
to
make
the
first
move
herself
and
go
down
to
the
town
did
they
consent
to
go
but
that
absurd
house
of
yours
is
ready
yet
protested
merideth
i
know
but
i
shall
stay
with
patty
until
it
is
returned
margaret
i
would
rather
wait
until
you
go
as
you
seem
so
worried
about
the
as
you
insist
upon
calling
it
but
if
you
wo
why
i
must
that
is
all
i
must
be
there
to
superintend
matters
then
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
moaned
merideth
for
i
simply
will
not
have
you
leave
us
here
and
go
down
there
to
live
and
i
shall
tell
everybody
she
added
firmly
that
it
is
merely
for
this
winter
and
that
we
allowed
you
to
do
it
only
on
that
one
condition
margaret
smiled
but
she
made
no
comment
it
was
enough
to
fight
present
battles
without
trying
to
win
future
ones
on
the
day
the
rest
of
the
family
left
hilcrest
margaret
moved
to
patty
little
house
on
the
hill
road
her
tiny
room
up
under
the
eaves
looked
woefully
small
and
inconvenient
to
eyes
that
were
accustomed
to
luxurious
hilcrest
and
the
supper
which
to
patty
was
sumptuous
in
the
extravagance
she
had
allowed
herself
in
her
visitor
honor
did
not
tempt
her
appetite
in
the
least
she
told
herself
however
that
all
this
was
well
and
good
and
she
ate
the
supper
and
laid
herself
down
upon
the
hard
bed
with
an
exaltation
that
rendered
her
oblivious
to
taste
and
feeling
in
due
time
the
mill
house
as
margaret
called
her
new
home
was
ready
for
occupancy
and
the
family
moved
in
naming
the
place
had
given
margaret
no
little
food
for
thought
i
want
something
simple
and
plain
she
had
said
to
patty
something
that
the
people
will
like
and
feel
an
interest
in
but
i
do
want
any
or
or
or
about
it
it
is
a
home
but
not
the
kind
that
begins
with
a
capital
letter
it
is
just
one
of
the
mill
houses
well
why
do
ye
call
it
the
house
then
an
done
with
it
demanded
patty
patty
you
a
genius
i
will
cried
margaret
and
the
mill
house
it
was
from
that
day
margaret
task
was
not
an
easy
one
both
she
and
her
house
were
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
she
had
some
trouble
in
finding
the
two
or
three
teachers
of
just
the
right
sort
to
help
her
even
when
she
had
found
these
teachers
and
opened
her
classes
in
sewing
cooking
and
the
care
of
children
only
a
few
enrolled
themselves
as
pupils
never
mind
said
margaret
we
shall
grow
you
see
the
mill
people
however
were
not
the
only
ones
that
learned
something
during
the
next
few
months
margaret
herself
learned
much
she
learned
that
while
there
were
men
who
purposely
idled
their
time
away
and
drank
up
their
children
wages
there
were
others
who
tramped
the
streets
in
vain
in
search
of
work
i
hai
got
nothin
ter
do
yit
miss
one
such
said
to
margaret
in
answer
to
her
sympathetic
inquiries
but
thar
ai
a
boss
but
what
said
if
i
got
kids
i
might
send
them
along
they
was
short
o
kids
i
been
tryin
ter
keep
rosy
an
katy
ter
school
i
was
ter
make
somethin
of
their
dad
an
their
mammy
is
but
i
reckon
as
how
i
have
ter
set
ter
work
oh
but
you
must
remonstrated
margaret
that
would
spoil
everything
do
you
see
that
you
must
they
must
go
to
school
get
an
education
the
man
gazed
at
her
with
dull
eyes
they
got
ter
eat
first
he
said
yes
yes
i
know
interposed
margaret
eagerly
i
understand
all
that
and
i
help
about
that
part
i
give
you
money
until
you
get
something
to
do
a
sudden
flash
came
into
the
man
eyes
his
shoulders
straightened
thank
ye
miss
we
be
charity
folks
and
he
turned
away
a
week
later
margaret
learned
that
rosy
and
katy
were
out
of
school
when
she
looked
them
up
she
found
them
at
work
in
the
mills
this
matter
of
the
school
question
was
a
great
puzzle
to
margaret
very
early
in
her
efforts
she
had
sought
out
the
public
and
asked
their
help
and
advice
she
was
appalled
at
the
number
of
children
who
appeared
scarcely
to
understand
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
school
this
state
of
affairs
she
could
not
seem
to
remedy
however
in
spite
of
her
earnest
efforts
the
parents
in
many
cases
were
indifferent
and
the
children
more
so
some
of
the
children
in
the
mills
indeed
were
there
solely
according
to
the
version
because
they
could
not
get
on
in
school
conscious
that
there
must
be
a
school
law
margaret
went
vigorously
to
work
to
find
and
enforce
it
then
and
not
until
then
did
she
realize
the
seriousness
of
even
this
one
phase
of
the
problem
she
had
undertaken
to
solve
there
were
other
phases
too
it
was
not
always
poverty
margaret
found
that
was
responsible
for
setting
the
children
to
work
sometimes
it
was
ambition
there
were
men
who
could
not
even
speak
the
language
of
their
adopted
country
intelligibly
yet
who
had
ever
before
them
the
one
end
and
aim
money
to
this
end
and
aim
were
sacrificed
all
the
life
and
strength
of
whatever
was
theirs
the
minute
such
a
man
boys
and
girls
were
big
enough
and
tall
enough
to
be
sworn
in
he
got
the
papers
and
set
them
to
work
and
never
after
that
as
long
as
they
could
move
one
dragging
little
foot
after
the
other
did
they
cease
to
pour
into
the
hungry
treasury
of
his
hand
the
pitiful
dimes
and
pennies
that
represented
all
they
knew
of
childhood
chapter
xxxii
the
winter
passed
and
the
spring
came
the
mill
house
even
to
the
most
skeptical
observer
showed
signs
of
being
a
success
even
already
a
visible
influence
had
radiated
from
its
shining
windows
and
orderly
yard
and
the
neighboring
houses
with
their
obvious
attempt
at
slickin
up
reminded
one
of
a
small
boy
who
has
been
told
to
wash
his
face
for
company
was
coming
the
classes
boasted
a
larger
attendance
and
the
stomachs
and
the
babies
of
many
a
family
in
the
town
were
feeling
the
beneficial
results
of
the
lessons
to
margaret
however
the
whole
thing
seemed
hopelessly
small
there
was
so
much
to
do
so
little
done
she
was
still
the
little
girl
with
the
teaspoon
and
the
bowl
of
sand
and
the
chasm
yawned
as
wide
as
ever
to
tell
the
truth
margaret
was
tired
discouraged
and
homesick
for
months
her
strength
time
nerves
and
sympathies
had
been
taxed
to
the
utmost
and
now
that
there
had
come
a
breathing
space
when
the
intricate
machinery
of
her
scheme
could
run
for
a
moment
without
her
hand
at
the
throttle
she
was
left
weak
and
nerveless
she
was
in
fact
perilously
near
a
breakdown
added
to
all
this
she
was
lonely
more
than
she
would
own
to
herself
she
missed
her
friends
her
home
life
at
hilcrest
and
the
tender
care
and
sympathetic
interest
that
had
been
lavished
upon
her
for
so
many
years
here
she
was
the
head
the
strong
tower
of
defense
the
one
to
whom
everybody
came
with
troubles
perplexities
and
griefs
there
was
no
human
being
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
comfort
they
all
looked
to
her
even
bobby
mcginnis
when
she
saw
him
at
all
which
was
seldom
treated
her
with
a
frigid
deference
that
was
inexpressibly
annoying
to
her
from
the
spencers
she
heard
irregularly
earlier
in
the
winter
the
letters
had
been
more
frequent
nervously
anxious
epistles
of
some
length
from
merideth
stilted
notes
half
protesting
half
pleading
from
ned
and
short
but
wonderfully
sympathetic
communications
from
frank
later
frank
had
fallen
very
ill
with
a
fever
of
some
sort
and
merideth
and
ned
had
written
only
hurried
little
bulletins
from
the
then
had
come
the
good
news
that
frank
was
out
of
danger
though
still
far
too
weak
to
undertake
the
long
journey
home
their
letters
showed
unmistakably
their
impatience
at
the
delay
and
questioned
her
as
to
her
health
and
welfare
but
could
set
no
date
for
their
return
frank
in
particular
was
disturbed
they
said
he
had
not
planned
to
leave
either
herself
or
the
mills
so
long
it
being
his
intention
when
he
went
away
merely
to
take
a
short
trip
with
his
sister
and
brother
and
then
hurry
back
to
america
alone
as
for
frank
himself
he
had
not
written
her
since
his
illness
margaret
was
thinking
of
all
this
and
was
feeling
specially
forlorn
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
little
at
the
mill
house
one
evening
in
early
april
she
held
a
book
before
her
but
she
was
not
reading
and
she
looked
up
at
once
when
patty
entered
the
room
i
sorry
ter
trouble
ye
began
patty
hesitatingly
but
bobby
mcginnis
is
here
an
wanted
me
ter
ask
ye
margaret
raised
an
imperious
hand
that
all
right
patty
she
said
so
sharply
that
patty
opened
wide
her
eyes
but
suppose
you
just
ask
bobby
mcginnis
to
come
here
to
me
and
ask
his
question
direct
i
will
see
him
now
and
patty
wondering
vaguely
what
had
come
to
her
mistress
as
she
insisted
upon
calling
margaret
fled
precipitately
two
minutes
later
bobby
mcginnis
himself
stood
tall
and
straight
just
inside
the
door
you
sent
for
me
he
asked
margaret
sprang
to
her
feet
all
the
pent
loneliness
of
the
past
weeks
and
months
burst
forth
in
a
stinging
whip
of
retort
yes
i
sent
for
you
she
paused
but
the
man
did
not
speak
and
in
a
moment
she
went
on
hurriedly
feverishly
i
always
send
for
you
if
i
see
you
at
all
and
yet
you
know
how
hard
i
trying
to
help
these
people
and
that
you
are
the
only
one
here
that
can
help
me
she
paused
again
and
again
the
man
was
silent
do
you
know
what
i
trying
to
do
she
asked
yes
the
lips
closed
firmly
over
the
single
word
did
i
ask
you
to
help
me
did
i
appoint
us
a
committee
of
two
to
do
the
work
her
voice
shook
and
her
chin
trembled
like
that
of
a
grieved
child
yes
again
that
strained
almost
harsh
monosyllable
margaret
made
an
impatient
gesture
bobby
mcginnis
why
do
you
help
me
she
demanded
tearfully
why
do
you
stand
aloof
and
send
to
me
why
do
you
come
to
me
frankly
and
freely
and
tell
me
the
best
way
to
deal
with
these
people
there
was
no
answer
the
man
had
half
turned
his
face
so
that
only
his
profile
showed
and
against
the
door
do
you
know
that
i
am
alone
here
that
i
have
no
friends
but
you
and
patty
she
went
on
tremulously
do
you
think
it
kind
of
you
to
let
me
struggle
along
alone
like
this
sometimes
it
seems
almost
as
if
you
were
afraid
i
am
afraid
cut
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
bobby
breathed
margaret
in
surprised
dismay
falling
back
before
the
fire
in
the
eyes
that
suddenly
turned
and
flashed
straight
into
hers
why
bobby
if
the
man
heard
he
did
not
heed
the
bonds
of
his
had
snapped
and
the
torrent
of
words
came
with
a
force
that
told
how
great
had
been
the
pressure
he
had
stepped
forward
as
she
fell
back
and
his
eyes
still
blazed
into
hers
i
afraid
i
afraid
of
myself
he
cried
i
do
dare
to
trust
myself
within
sight
of
your
dear
eyes
or
within
touch
of
your
dear
hands
though
all
the
while
i
hungry
for
both
perhaps
i
do
let
you
send
for
me
instead
of
coming
of
my
own
free
will
but
i
never
without
the
thought
of
you
and
the
hope
of
catching
somewhere
a
glimpse
of
even
your
dress
perhaps
i
do
stand
aloof
but
many
the
night
walked
the
street
outside
watching
the
light
at
your
window
and
the
night
i
not
gone
home
until
dawn
lest
some
harm
come
to
the
woman
i
loved
so
good
god
what
am
i
saying
he
broke
off
hoarsely
dropping
his
face
into
his
hands
and
sinking
into
the
chair
behind
him
over
by
the
table
margaret
stood
silent
motionless
her
eyes
on
the
bowed
figure
of
the
man
before
her
gradually
her
confused
senses
were
coming
into
something
like
order
slowly
her
dazed
thoughts
were
taking
shape
it
was
her
own
fault
she
had
brought
this
thing
upon
herself
she
should
have
seen
have
understood
and
now
she
had
caused
all
this
sorrow
to
this
dear
friend
of
her
childhood
the
little
boy
who
had
befriended
her
when
she
was
alone
and
hungry
and
lost
but
after
all
why
should
he
not
love
her
and
why
should
she
not
love
him
he
was
good
and
true
and
noble
and
for
years
he
had
loved
her
she
remembered
now
their
childish
compact
and
she
bitterly
reproached
herself
for
not
thinking
of
it
before
it
might
have
saved
her
this
still
did
she
want
to
save
herself
this
was
it
not
after
all
the
very
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
where
and
how
could
she
do
more
good
in
the
world
than
right
here
with
this
strong
loving
heart
to
help
her
she
loved
him
too
she
was
sure
she
did
though
she
had
never
realized
it
before
doubtless
that
was
half
the
cause
of
her
present
restlessness
and
unhappiness
she
had
loved
him
all
the
time
and
did
not
know
it
surely
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
who
could
so
wisely
help
her
in
her
dear
work
of
course
she
loved
him
very
softly
margaret
crossed
the
room
and
touched
the
man
shoulder
bobby
i
did
not
understand
i
did
not
know
she
said
gently
you
wo
have
to
stay
away
any
more
wo
have
to
stay
away
the
man
was
on
his
feet
incredulous
wonder
in
his
eyes
no
we
we
will
do
it
together
this
work
but
you
do
mean
you
ca
mean
mcginnis
paused
his
breath
suspended
but
i
do
she
answered
the
quick
red
flying
to
her
cheeks
then
half
laughing
half
crying
she
faltered
and
and
i
should
think
make
ask
margaret
choked
the
man
as
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
caught
the
girl
two
hands
to
his
lips
illustration
margaret
crossed
the
room
and
touched
the
shoulder

ned
spencer
returned
alone
to
hilcrest
about
the
middle
of
april
in
spite
of
their
able
corps
of
managers
the
spencers
did
not
often
leave
the
mills
for
so
long
a
time
without
the
occasional
presence
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
firm
though
ned
frequently
declared
that
the
mills
were
like
a
clock
that
winds
itself
so
admirably
adjusted
was
the
intricate
machinery
of
their
management
it
was
not
without
some
little
embarrassment
and
effort
that
ned
sought
out
the
mill
house
immediately
upon
his
return
and
called
on
margaret
i
left
della
and
frank
to
come
more
slowly
he
said
after
the
greetings
were
over
frank
poor
chap
is
half
strong
yet
but
he
was
impatient
that
some
one
should
be
here
for
that
matter
i
found
things
in
such
fine
shape
that
i
told
them
i
was
going
away
again
we
made
more
money
when
i
was
than
when
i
was
margaret
smiled
but
very
faintly
she
understood
only
too
well
that
behind
all
this
lay
the
reasons
why
her
urgent
requests
and
pleas
regarding
some
of
the
children
had
been
so
ignored
in
the
office
of
spencer
spencer
during
the
last
few
months
she
almost
said
as
much
to
ned
but
she
changed
her
mind
and
questioned
him
about
frank
health
and
their
trip
instead
the
call
was
not
an
unqualified
success
at
least
it
was
not
a
success
so
far
as
margaret
was
concerned
the
young
man
was
plainly
displeased
with
the
chair
in
which
he
sat
and
with
his
hostess
simple
toilet
the
reproachful
look
had
gone
from
his
eyes
it
was
true
but
in
its
place
was
one
of
annoyed
disapproval
that
was
scarcely
less
unpleasant
to
encounter
there
were
long
pauses
in
the
conversation
which
neither
participant
seemed
able
to
fill
once
margaret
tried
to
tell
her
visitor
of
her
work
but
he
was
so
clearly
unsympathetic
that
she
cut
it
short
and
introduced
another
subject
of
mcginnis
she
did
not
speak
time
enough
for
that
when
frank
spencer
should
return
and
the
engagement
would
have
to
be
known
she
did
tell
him
however
of
her
plans
to
go
to
new
york
later
in
search
of
the
twins
i
shall
take
patty
with
me
she
explained
and
we
shall
make
it
a
sort
of
vacation
we
both
need
the
change
and
the
well
it
wo
be
exactly
a
rest
perhaps
no
i
fear
not
ned
returned
grimly
i
do
hope
margaret
that
when
della
gets
home
you
take
a
real
rest
and
change
at
hilcrest
surely
by
that
time
you
be
ready
to
cut
loose
from
all
this
sort
of
thing
margaret
laughed
merrily
though
her
eyes
were
wistful
we
wait
and
see
how
rested
new
york
makes
me
she
said
but
margaret
you
surely
are
going
to
come
to
hilcrest
then
appealed
ned
whether
you
need
rest
or
not
we
see
ned
we
see
was
all
she
would
say
but
this
time
her
voice
had
lost
its
merriment
ned
though
he
did
not
know
it
and
though
margaret
was
loth
to
acknowledge
it
even
to
herself
had
touched
upon
a
tender
point
she
did
long
for
hilcrest
its
rest
its
quiet
and
the
tender
care
that
its
people
had
always
given
her
she
longed
for
even
one
day
in
which
she
would
have
no
problems
to
solve
no
misery
to
try
to
alleviate
one
day
in
which
she
might
be
the
old
margaret
she
reproached
herself
bitterly
for
all
this
however
and
accused
herself
of
being
false
to
her
work
and
her
dear
people
but
in
the
next
breath
she
would
deny
the
accusation
and
say
that
it
was
only
because
she
was
worn
out
and
dead
tired
when
the
people
do
get
home
she
said
to
bobby
mcginnis
one
day
when
the
people
do
get
home
we
take
a
rest
you
and
i
we
go
up
to
hilcrest
and
just
play
for
a
day
or
two
it
will
do
us
good
to
hilcrest
i
cried
the
man
certainly
why
not
returned
margaret
quickly
a
little
disturbed
at
the
surprise
in
her
lover
voice
surely
you
do
think
that
the
man
i
expecting
to
marry
can
stay
away
from
hilcrest
do
you
of
course
not
murmured
mcginnis
but
his
eyes
were
troubled
and
margaret
noticed
that
he
did
not
speak
again
for
some
time
it
was
this
perhaps
that
set
her
own
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
when
after
all
had
she
thought
of
them
before
together
bobby
and
hilcrest
it
had
always
been
bobby
and
the
work
chapter
xxxiv
it
was
on
a
particularly
beautiful
morning
in
june
that
margaret
and
patty
started
for
new
york
so
beautiful
that
margaret
declared
it
to
be
a
good
omen
we
find
them
you
see
she
cried
little
maggie
had
been
left
at
the
mill
house
with
the
teachers
and
for
the
first
time
for
years
patty
found
herself
and
at
liberty
to
enjoy
herself
to
the
full
i
hai
had
sech
a
grand
time
since
i
was
a
little
girl
an
went
ter
she
exulted
as
the
train
bore
them
swiftly
toward
their
destination
even
when
sam
an
me
was
married
we
did
stop
fur
no
we
jest
worked
an
say
did
ye
see
how
grand
sam
was
now
she
broke
off
jubilantly
he
drunk
once
last
week
thar
could
no
one
made
him
do
it
only
you
seems
how
i
never
could
thank
ye
fur
all
you
done
she
added
wistfully
but
you
do
thank
me
patty
every
day
of
your
life
contended
margaret
brightly
you
thank
me
by
just
helping
me
as
you
do
at
the
mill
house
pooh
as
if
that
was
anything
compared
ter
what
you
does
fur
me
scoffed
patty
do
i
git
pay
money
fur
bein
matron
in
new
york
margaret
went
immediately
to
a
quiet
but
conveniently
located
hotel
where
the
rooms
she
had
engaged
were
waiting
for
them
to
patty
even
this
unpretentious
hostelry
was
palatial
as
were
the
service
and
the
dinner
in
the
great
that
evening
i
do
wonder
folks
likes
ter
be
rich
she
observed
after
a
silent
survey
of
the
merry
throng
about
her
i
mebbe
magoon
say
this
was
worse
than
them
autymobiles
she
hates
ter
see
so
an
it
do
look
quite
fair
does
it
i
wonder
now
do
ye
any
one
of
ever
thought
of
divvyin
up
a
dreamy
look
came
into
the
blue
eyes
opposite
perhaps
who
knows
murmured
margaret
still
ever
crossed
the
line
perhaps
so
they
do
huh
margaret
smiled
nothing
patty
i
only
meant
that
they
had
lived
in
kitchen
and
kept
all
their
wealth
in
a
tin
cup
no
they
hai
said
patty
her
eyes
on
the
sparkle
of
a
diamond
on
the
plump
white
finger
of
a
woman
near
by
margaret
and
patty
lost
no
time
the
next
morning
in
beginning
their
search
for
the
twins
there
was
very
little
after
all
that
patty
knew
of
her
sisters
since
she
had
last
seen
them
but
that
little
was
treasured
and
analyzed
and
carefully
weighed
the
twins
were
at
the
whalens
when
last
heard
from
the
whalens
therefore
must
be
the
first
ones
to
be
looked
up
and
to
the
whalens
as
represented
by
the
address
in
clarabella
last
letter
the
searchers
proposed
immediately
to
go
an
ter
think
that
you
was
bein
looked
fur
jest
like
this
once
remarked
patty
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
a
narrow
dingy
street
poor
dear
mother
how
she
must
have
suffered
murmured
margaret
her
eyes
shrinking
from
the
squalor
and
misery
all
about
them
i
think
perhaps
never
until
now
did
i
realize
it
quite
she
added
softly
her
eyes
moist
with
tears
ye
see
the
whalens
ai
whar
they
was
when
you
left
in
that
nice
place
you
got
fur
began
patty
after
a
moment
consulting
the
paper
in
her
hand
they
could
keep
that
but
clarabella
wrote
they
one
or
two
blocks
from
the
alley
the
alley
oh
how
i
should
love
to
see
the
alley
cried
margaret
and
we
will
patty
we
go
there
surely
before
we
return
home
but
first
we
find
the
whalens
and
the
twins
the
whalens
and
the
twins
however
did
not
prove
to
be
so
easily
found
they
certainly
were
not
at
the
address
given
in
clarabella
letter
the
place
was
occupied
by
strangers
people
who
had
never
heard
the
name
of
whalen
it
took
two
days
of
time
and
innumerable
questions
to
find
anybody
in
the
neighborhood
in
fact
who
had
heard
the
name
of
whalen
but
at
last
patience
and
diligence
were
rewarded
and
early
on
the
third
morning
margaret
and
patty
started
out
to
follow
up
a
clew
given
them
by
a
woman
who
had
known
the
whalens
and
who
remembered
them
well
even
this
however
promising
as
it
was
did
not
lead
to
immediate
success
and
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
that
margaret
and
patty
toiled
up
four
flights
of
stairs
and
found
a
little
bent
old
woman
sitting
in
a
green
chair
that
neither
margaret
nor
patty
could
fail
to
recognize
do
i
remember
of
the
alley
quavered
the
old
woman
excitedly
in
response
to
margaret
questions
sure
an
of
course
i
do
she
was
the
tirror
of
the
hull
place
till
she
was
that
turned
about

got
ter

a
blissed
angel
straight
from
hiven
as
if

laughed
margaret

cried
the
old
woman
peering
over
and
through
her
glasses
and
finally
snatching
them
off
altogether
but
i
am
and
this
is
durgin
who
used
to
be
patty
murphy

margaret

are
trying
to
find
them
and
we
thought
perhaps
you
could
tell
us
where
they
are
whalen
shook
her
head
i
knows
but
i
do
know
whar
they
be
now
but
you
did
know
interposed
patty
you
must
known
four
five
years
ago
for
my
little
maggie
was
jest
born
when
the
twins
come
ter
new
york
an
found
ye
they
wrote
how
they
was
livin
with
ye
the
old
woman
nodded
her
head
i
know
she
said
i
know
we
was
livin
over
by
the
alley
but
they
did
stay
my
old
man
he
died
an
we
broke
up
sure
an
i
but
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
airth
iver
since
an
i
grown
old
before
my
time
i
am
but
whalen
just
think
just
remember
urged
margaret
where
did
they
go
surely
you
can
tell
that
again
whalen
shook
her
head
mike

an
tom
an
mary

an
jamie
sure
an
he

his

an
they

him
ter
the
horspital
bad
cess
to
an
was
all
that
upsettin
that
i
did
know
nothin
what
did
happen
i
seen
then
i
did
seen
an
that
all
thar
was
to
it
it
the
truth
i
yez
it
was
with
heavy
hearts
that
margaret
and
patty
left
the
little
attic
room
half
an
hour
later
they
had
no
clew
now
upon
which
to
work
and
the
accomplishment
of
their
purpose
seemed
almost
impossible
in
the
little
attic
room
behind
them
however
they
left
nothing
but
rejoicing
margaret
gifts
had
been
liberal
and
her
promises
for
the
future
even
more
than
that
the
little
bent
old
woman
could
look
straight
ahead
now
to
days
when
there
would
be
no
bare
cupboards
and
empty
coal
scuttles
to
fill
her
soul
with
apprehension
and
her
body
with
discomfort
back
to
the
hotel
went
margaret
and
patty
for
a
rest
hoping
that
daylight
and
the
morning
sun
would
urge
them
to
new
efforts
and
give
them
fresh
courage
in
spite
of
the
unpromising
outlook
nor
were
their
hopes
unfulfilled
the
morning
sun
did
bring
fresh
courage
and
determined
to
make
a
fresh
start
they
turned
their
steps
to
the
alley
the
alley
never
forgot
that
visit
nor
the
days
that
immediately
followed
it
there
were
men
and
women
who
remembered
mag
of
the
alley
and
patty
murphy
but
there
were
more
who
did
not
there
were
none
however
that
did
not
know
who
they
were
before
the
week
was
out
and
that
had
not
heard
the
story
of
margaret
own
childhood
experience
in
that
same
alley
years
before
as
for
the
alley
it
did
not
know
itself
it
had
heard
to
be
sure
of
christmas
it
had
even
experienced
it
in
a
way
with
tickets
for
a
salvation
army
tree
or
dinner
but
all
this
occurred
in
the
winter
when
it
was
cold
and
snowy
and
it
was
spring
now
it
was
not
christmas
of
course
and
yet
the
entire
alley
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
flooded
with
good
things
to
eat
and
with
innumerable
things
to
wear
there
was
not
a
child
that
did
not
boast
a
new
toy
nor
a
sick
room
that
did
not
display
fruit
and
flowers
even
the
cats
and
the
dogs
stopped
their
fighting
and
lay
and
content
in
the
sun
no
wonder
the
alley
rubbed
its
eyes
and
failed
to
recognize
its
own
face
the
alley
received
but
did
not
give
nowhere
was
there
a
trace
of
the
twins
and
after
a
two
weeks
search
and
a
fruitless
following
of
clews
that
were
no
clews
at
all
even
margaret
was
forced
sorrowfully
to
acknowledge
defeat
on
the
evening
before
the
day
they
had
set
to
go
home
patty
timidly
said
i
had
oughter
ask
it
after
all
you
done
but
do
ye
could
we
mebbe
jest
jest
go
ter
fur
a
minute
jest
ter
look
at
it
yes
we
was
so
happy
thar
once
went
on
patty
earnestly
you
an
me
an
the
twins
i
hai
never

it
nor
what
they
learnt

all
the
good
thar

in
me
till

i
thought

it
easier

other
that

of
course

cried
margaret
i
should
love
to
go
there
myself
you
know
i
owe
it
everything
too
it
was
not
for
home
therefore
that
margaret
and
patty
left
new
york
the
next
morning
but
for
the
trip
to
tarrytown
and
across
the
hudson
was
soon
over
as
was
the
short
drive
in
the
fresh
morning
air
almost
before
the
two
travelers
realized
where
they
were
the
beautiful
buildings
and
grounds
of
appeared
before
their
eyes
margaret
had
only
to
tell
that
they
too
had
once
been
happy
little
guests
in
the
years
gone
by
to
make
their
welcome
a
doubly
cordial
one
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
wandering
about
the
place
with
eyes
and
ears
alert
for
familiar
sights
and
sounds
in
the
big
pavilion
where
their
own
hungry
little
stomachs
had
been
filled
were
now
numerous
other
little
stomachs
experiencing
the
same
delight
and
in
the
long
dormitories
where
their
own
tired
little
bodies
had
rested
were
the
same
long
rows
of
little
white
beds
waiting
for
other
weary
little
limbs
and
heads
margaret
eyes
grew
moist
here
as
she
thought
of
that
dear
mother
who
years
before
had
placed
over
just
such
a
little
bed
the
pictured
face
of
her
lost
little
girl
and
of
how
that
same
little
girl
had
seen
it
and
had
thus
found
the
dear
mother
arms
waiting
for
her
it
was
just
as
margaret
and
patty
turned
to
leave
the
grounds
that
they
saw
a
young
woman
not
twenty
feet
away
leading
two
small
children
patty
gave
a
sudden
cry
the
next
moment
she
bounded
forward
and
caught
the
young
woman
by
the
shoulders
clarabella
clarabella
i
jest
know
you
clarabella
murphy
it
was
a
joyous
then
indeed
a
of
tears
laughter
questions
and
ejaculations
at
the
end
of
it
margaret
and
patty
hurried
away
with
a
bit
of
paper
on
which
was
the
address
of
a
certain
city
missionary
all
the
way
back
to
new
york
they
talked
it
over
the
story
of
the
life
during
all
those
years
of
how
after
months
of
hardship
they
had
found
the
good
city
missionary
and
of
how
she
had
helped
them
and
they
had
helped
her
until
now
clarabella
had
gone
to
as
one
of
the
caretakers
for
the
summer
and
arabella
had
remained
behind
at
the
missionary
home
to
help
what
she
could
in
the
missionary
daily
work
and
we
go
now
and
see
arabella
cried
patty
as
they
stepped
from
the
train
at
new
york
an
ai
it
jest
wonderful
wonderful
ter
think
that
we
are
ter
see
arabella
chapter
xxxv
when
margaret
and
patty
went
home
three
days
later
they
were
accompanied
by
a
beautiful
girl
whose
dark
eyes
carried
a
peculiar
appeal
in
their
velvety
depths
some
of
the
passengers
in
the
car
that
day
wondered
at
such
an
expression
on
the
face
of
one
so
young
and
so
lovely
but
when
the
girl
rose
and
moved
down
the
aisle
they
wondered
no
longer
she
was
lame
and
in
every
movement
her
slender
form
seemed
to
shrink
from
curious
eyes
margaret
had
found
her
little
friend
far
from
strong
arabella
had
been
taxing
her
strength
to
the
utmost
assisting
the
missionary
through
the
day
and
attending
night
school
in
the
evening
she
had
worked
and
studied
hard
and
the
strain
was
telling
on
her
already
frail
constitution
all
this
margaret
saw
at
once
and
declared
that
arabella
must
come
home
with
them
to
the
mill
house
but
i
could
the
girl
had
objected
i
could
be
a
burden
to
you
and
patty
oh
but
you
wo
be
margaret
had
returned
promptly
you
going
to
be
a
help
to
patty
and
me
the
mill
house
needs
you
the
work
is
increasing
and
we
have
teachers
enough
oh
then
i
come
the
girl
had
sighed
contentedly
nor
did
she
know
that
before
night
margaret
had
found
and
engaged
still
another
teacher
lest
arabella
when
she
joined
the
mill
house
family
should
find
too
much
to
do
almost
the
first
piece
of
news
that
margaret
heard
upon
her
return
was
that
the
family
were
back
at
hilcrest
and
that
merideth
had
already
driven
down
to
the
mill
house
three
times
in
hopes
to
get
tidings
of
margaret
coming
when
merideth
drove
down
the
fourth
time
margaret
herself
was
there
and
went
back
with
her
to
hilcrest
my
dear
child
how
dreadfully
you
look
merideth
had
exclaimed
you
are
worn
out
and
no
wonder
you
must
come
straight
home
with
me
and
rest
and
because
merideth
had
been
tactful
enough
to
say
rest
and
not
stay
margaret
had
gone
willingly
and
thankfully
she
was
tired
and
she
did
need
a
rest
but
she
was
not
a
little
concerned
to
find
how
really
hungry
she
was
for
the
cool
quiet
of
the
west
veranda
and
how
eagerly
she
listened
to
the
low
sweet
voices
of
her
friends
in
pleasant
chat
it
had
been
so
long
since
she
had
heard
low
sweet
voices
in
pleasant
chat
the
thin
cheeks
and
hollow
eyes
of
frank
spencer
shocked
her
greatly
she
had
not
supposed
a
few
short
months
could
so
change
a
strong
man
into
the
mere
shadow
of
his
former
self
there
was
a
look
too
in
his
eyes
that
stirred
her
curiously
and
true
to
her
usual
sympathetic
response
to
trouble
wherever
she
found
it
she
set
herself
now
to
the
task
of
driving
that
look
away
to
this
end
in
spite
of
her
own
weariness
she
played
and
sang
and
devoted
herself
untiringly
to
the
amusement
of
the
man
who
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
go
down
to
the
mills
it
had
been
planned
that
immediately
upon
frank
spencer
return
mcginnis
should
go
to
him
with
the
story
of
his
love
for
margaret
this
plan
was
abandoned
however
when
margaret
saw
how
weak
and
ill
her
guardian
was
we
must
wait
until
he
is
better
she
said
to
bobby
when
he
called
as
had
been
arranged
on
the
second
evening
after
her
arrival
he
may
not
be
quite
pleased
at
first
you
know
she
went
on
frankly
and
i
want
to
cause
him
sorrow
just
now
then
be
better
if
i
do
come
up
again
just
yet
stammered
bobby
miserably
his
longing
eyes
on
her
face
yes
i
let
you
know
when
he
well
enough
to
see
you
returned
margaret
and
she
smiled
brightly
nor
did
it
occur
to
her
that
for
a
young
woman
who
has
but
recently
become
engaged
she
was
accepting
with
extraordinary
equanimity
the
fact
that
she
should
not
see
her
lover
again
for
some
days
it
did
occur
to
bobby
however
and
his
eyes
were
troubled
they
were
still
troubled
as
he
sat
up
far
into
the
night
thinking
in
the
shabby
little
room
he
called
home
one
by
one
the
days
passed
at
hilcrest
margaret
was
fast
regaining
her
old
buoyant
health
and
was
beginning
to
talk
of
taking
up
her
work
again
much
to
the
distress
of
the
family
frank
spencer
too
was
better
though
in
spite
of
margaret
earnest
efforts
the
curiously
somber
look
was
not
gone
from
his
eyes
it
even
seemed
deeper
and
more
noticeable
than
ever
sometimes
margaret
thought
never
before
had
margaret
known
quite
so
well
the
man
who
had
so
carefully
guarded
her
since
childhood
she
suddenly
began
to
appreciate
what
he
had
done
for
her
all
those
years
she
realized
too
with
almost
the
shock
of
a
surprise
how
young
he
had
been
when
the
charge
was
intrusted
to
him
and
what
it
must
have
meant
to
a
youth
of
twenty
to
have
a
strange
hysterical
little
girl
ten
years
old
thrust
upon
him
so
unceremoniously
she
realized
it
all
the
more
fully
now
that
the
pleasant
intercourse
of
the
last
two
weeks
had
seemed
to
strip
from
him
the
ten
years
difference
in
their
ages
they
were
good
friends
comrades
day
after
day
they
had
read
and
sung
and
walked
together
and
she
knew
that
he
had
exerted
every
effort
to
make
her
happy
more
keenly
than
ever
now
she
regretted
that
she
must
bring
sorrow
to
him
in
acknowledging
her
engagement
to
bobby
she
knew
very
well
that
he
would
not
approve
of
the
marriage
had
he
not
already
pleaded
with
her
to
stay
there
at
hilcrest
as
ned
wife
and
had
he
not
always
disapproved
of
her
having
much
to
say
to
mcginnis
it
was
hard
indeed
in
the
face
of
all
this
to
tell
him
but
it
must
be
done
in
two
days
now
he
was
going
back
to
the
mills
there
was
really
no
excuse
for
any
further
delay
she
must
send
for
bobby
there
was
a
on
the
night
bobby
mcginnis
came
to
hilcrest
the
young
man
arrived
just
before
the
storm
broke
and
was
ushered
at
once
by
margaret
herself
to
the
little
den
where
frank
spencer
sat
alone
merideth
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
headache
and
ned
was
out
of
town
so
margaret
had
the
house
to
herself
for
a
time
she
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
and
the
great
then
she
sat
down
in
a
shadowy
corner
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
library
and
of
the
door
of
the
den
she
shivered
at
every
clap
of
thunder
and
sent
a
furtive
glance
toward
that
door
wondering
if
the
storm
outside
were
typical
of
the
one
which
even
then
might
be
breaking
over
bobby
head
it
was
very
late
when
mcginnis
came
out
of
the
den
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
so
late
that
he
could
stop
for
only
a
few
words
with
the
girl
who
hurried
across
the
room
to
meet
him
his
face
was
and
his
whole
appearance
showed
the
strain
he
had
been
under
for
the
last
two
hours
spencer
was
very
kind
he
said
huskily
in
response
to
the
question
in
margaret
eyes
at
first
of
course
he
but
never
mind
that
part
he
has
been
very
kind
but
i
i
ca
tell
you
now
all
that
he
said
to
me
perhaps
some
other
time
mcginnis
was
plainly
very
much
moved
his
words
came
brokenly
and
with
long
pauses
for
some
time
after
her
lover
had
gone
margaret
waited
for
frank
spencer
to
come
out
and
speak
to
her
but
the
door
of
the
den
remained
fast
shut
and
she
finally
went
without
seeing
him
the
next
few
days
at
hilcrest
were
hard
for
all
concerned
before
margaret
had
come
down
stairs
on
the
morning
following
mcginnis
call
frank
spencer
had
told
his
sister
of
the
engagement
and
after
the
first
shock
of
the
news
was
over
he
had
said
constrainedly
and
with
averted
eyes
there
is
just
one
thing
for
us
to
do
della
or
rather
for
us
not
to
do
we
must
not
drive
margaret
away
from
us
she
has
full
right
to
marry
the
man
she
loves
of
course
and
if
if
we
are
too
censorious
it
will
result
only
in
our
losing
her
altogether
it
is
what
we
want
to
do
but
what
we
must
do
we
must
accept
him
or
lose
her
i
i
afraid
i
forgot
myself
at
first
last
night
went
on
frank
hurriedly
and
said
some
pretty
harsh
things
i
did
realize
i
was
saying
until
i
saw
the
look
on
his
face
mcginnis
is
a
straightforward
manly
young
fellow
we
must
not
forget
that
della
but
think
of
his
moaned
merideth
frank
winced
i
know
he
said
but
we
must
do
our
best
to
remedy
that
i
shall
advance
him
and
increase
his
pay
at
once
of
course
and
eventually
he
will
become
one
of
the
firm
if
margaret
marries
him
merideth
burst
into
tears
how
can
you
take
it
so
calmly
frank
she
sobbed
you
do
seem
to
care
at
all
frank
spencer
lips
parted
then
closed
again
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
after
all
that
she
should
not
know
just
how
much
he
did
care
it
may
not
be
myself
i
thinking
of
he
said
at
last
quietly
i
want
margaret
happy
and
he
turned
away
margaret
was
not
happy
however
as
the
days
passed
in
spite
of
everybody
effort
to
act
as
if
everything
was
as
usual
nobody
succeeded
in
doing
it
and
at
last
margaret
announced
her
determination
to
go
back
to
the
mill
house
she
agreed
however
to
call
it
a
visit
for
merideth
had
cried
tragically
but
margaret
dear
if
we
are
going
to
lose
you
altogether
by
and
by
surely
you
will
give
us
all
your
time
now
that
you
can
chapter
xxxvi
bobby
mcginnis
wondered
sometimes
that
summer
why
he
was
not
happier
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
an
outsider
he
surely
had
enough
to
make
any
man
happy
he
was
young
strong
and
in
a
position
of
trust
and
profit
he
was
moreover
engaged
to
the
girl
he
loved
and
that
girl
was
everything
that
was
good
and
beautiful
and
he
saw
her
almost
every
day
all
this
bobby
knew
and
still
he
wondered
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
margaret
these
days
their
engagement
had
come
to
be
an
accepted
fact
and
the
first
flurry
of
surprise
and
comment
had
passed
the
mill
house
with
patty
in
charge
was
steadily
progressing
margaret
had
taken
up
her
work
again
with
fresh
zest
but
true
to
her
promise
to
merideth
she
spent
many
a
day
and
sometimes
two
or
three
days
at
hilcrest
all
this
however
did
not
interfere
with
bobby
seeing
her
for
he
too
went
to
hilcrest
in
accordance
with
margaret
express
wishes
but
bobby
margaret
had
said
in
response
to
his
troubled
remonstrances
are
you
not
going
to
be
my
husband
of
course
you
are
then
you
must
come
to
meet
my
friends
and
bobby
went
bobby
mcginnis
found
himself
in
a
new
position
then
he
was
robert
mcginnis
the
accepted
suitor
of
miss
margaret
kendall
and
as
such
he
was
introduced
to
margaret
friends
it
was
just
here
perhaps
that
misery
began
for
bobby
he
was
not
more
at
ease
in
his
new
evening
clothes
than
he
would
have
been
in
the
garb
of
sing
sing
nor
did
he
feel
less
conspicuous
among
the
gay
throng
about
margaret
chair
than
he
would
if
he
had
indeed
worn
the
prison
stripes
as
bobby
saw
it
he
in
prison
beyond
the
four
walls
of
which
lay
a
world
he
had
never
seen
a
world
of
beautiful
music
and
fine
pictures
a
world
of
great
books
and
famous
men
a
world
of
travel
ease
and
pleasure
he
could
but
dimly
guess
the
meaning
of
half
of
what
was
said
and
the
conversation
might
as
well
have
been
conducted
in
a
foreign
language
so
far
as
there
being
any
possibility
of
his
participating
in
it
big
tall
and
silent
he
stood
as
if
apart
and
because
he
was
apart
he
watched
he
began
to
understand
then
why
he
was
unhappy
yet
he
was
not
watching
himself
he
was
watching
margaret
she
knew
this
world
this
world
that
was
outside
his
prison
walls
and
she
was
at
home
in
it
there
was
a
light
in
her
eye
that
he
had
never
brought
there
though
he
had
seen
it
sometimes
when
she
had
been
particularly
interested
in
her
work
at
the
mill
house
as
he
watched
her
now
he
caught
the
quick
play
of
color
on
her
cheeks
and
heard
the
ring
of
enthusiasm
in
her
voice
one
subject
after
another
was
introduced
and
for
each
she
had
question
comment
or
jest
not
once
did
she
appeal
to
him
but
why
should
she
he
asked
himself
bitterly
they
those
others
near
her
knew
this
world
he
did
not
know
it
sometimes
the
mills
were
spoken
of
and
she
was
questioned
about
her
work
then
indeed
she
turned
to
him
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
whom
she
turned
she
turned
quite
as
frequently
to
the
man
who
was
seldom
far
away
from
the
sound
of
her
voice
when
she
was
at
hilcrest
frank
spencer
mcginnis
had
a
new
object
for
his
brooding
eyes
then
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
that
it
was
to
this
same
frank
spencer
that
margaret
turned
when
subjects
other
than
the
mills
were
under
discussion
there
seemed
to
be
times
indeed
when
she
apparently
heard
only
his
voice
and
recognized
only
his
presence
so
intimate
was
the
sympathy
between
them
mcginnis
saw
something
else
too
he
saw
the
look
in
frank
spencer
eyes
and
after
that
he
did
not
question
again
the
cause
of
his
own
misery
sometimes
mcginnis
would
forget
all
this
or
would
call
it
the
silly
fears
of
a
jealous
man
who
sees
nothing
but
adoration
in
every
eye
turned
upon
his
love
such
times
were
always
when
margaret
was
back
at
the
mill
house
and
when
it
seemed
as
if
she
too
were
inside
his
prison
walls
with
him
leaving
that
hated
unknown
world
shut
forever
out
then
would
come
hilcrest
and
the
reaction
she
does
not
love
me
he
would
moan
night
after
night
as
he
tossed
in
sleepless
misery
she
does
not
love
me
but
she
does
not
know
it
yet
she
is
everything
that
is
good
and
beautiful
and
kind
but
i
never
never
can
make
her
happy
i
might
have
known

chapter
xxxvii
the
spencers
remained
at
hilcrest
nearly
all
summer
with
only
a
short
trip
or
two
on
the
part
of
merideth
and
ned
the
place
was
particularly
cool
and
delightful
in
summer
and
this
season
it
was
more
so
than
usual
had
always
been
popular
at
hilcrest
and
never
more
so
than
now
so
popular
indeed
were
they
that
margaret
suspected
them
to
be
sometimes
merely
an
excuse
to
gain
her
own
presence
at
hilcrest
there
were
no
guests
however
on
the
monday
night
that
the
mills
caught
fire
even
margaret
was
down
at
the
mill
house
merideth
always
a
light
sleeper
was
roused
by
the
first
shrill
blast
of
the
whistle
from
her
bed
she
could
see
the
lurid
glow
of
the
sky
and
with
a
cry
of
terror
she
ran
to
the
window
the
next
moment
she
threw
a
over
her
shoulders
and
ran
to
frank
spencer
room
across
the
hall
frank
it
the
mills
they
all
afire
she
called
frenziedly
oh
frank
it
awful
from
behind
the
closed
door
came
a
sudden
stir
and
the
sound
of
bare
feet
striking
the
floor
then
frank
voice
i
be
out
at
once
and
della
see
if
ned
awake
and
if
you
can
call
up
peters
please
we
shall
want
a
motor
car
merideth
wrung
her
hands
frank
frank
i
ca
have
you
go
i
ca
have
you
go
she
moaned
hysterically
yet
all
the
while
she
was
hurrying
to
the
telephone
that
would
give
the
alarm
and
order
the
car
that
would
take
him
in
five
minutes
the
house
was
astir
from
end
to
end
lights
flashed
here
and
there
and
terrified
voices
and
hurried
footsteps
echoed
through
the
great
halls
down
in
the
town
the
whistles
were
still
shrieking
their
frenzied
summons
and
up
in
the
sky
the
lurid
glow
of
the
flames
was
deepening
and
spreading
then
came
a
hurried
word
from
mcginnis
over
the
telephone
the
fire
had
caught
in
one
of
the
buildings
that
had
been
closed
for
repairs
which
accounted
for
the
great
headway
it
had
gained
before
it
was
discovered
there
was
a
strong
east
wind
and
the
fire
was
rapidly
spreading
and
had
already
attacked
the
next
building
on
the
west
the
operatives
were
in
a
panic
there
was
danger
of
great
loss
of
life
and
all
help
possible
was
needed
merideth
who
heard
could
only
wring
her
hands
and
moan
again
i
ca
have
them
go
i
ca
have
them
go
yet
five
minutes
later
she
sent
them
off
both
frank
and
ned
with
a
fervid
god
keep
you
ringing
in
their
ears
down
in
the
mill
house
all
was
commotion
margaret
was
everywhere
alert
capable
and
untiring
we
can
do
the
most
good
by
staying
right
here
and
keeping
the
house
open
she
said
we
are
so
near
that
they
may
want
to
bring
some
of
the
children
here
if
there
should
be
any
that
are
hurt
or
overcome
at
all
events
we
have
everything
ready
and
we
have
hot
coffee
for
the
men
almost
immediately
they
came
those
limp
unconscious
little
forms
borne
in
strong
tender
arms
some
of
the
children
had
only
fainted
others
had
been
crushed
and
bruised
in
the
mad
rush
for
safety
before
an
hour
had
passed
the
mill
house
looked
like
a
hospital
and
every
available
helper
was
pressed
into
service
as
a
nurse
toward
morning
a
small
boy
breathless
and
rushed
into
the
main
hall
they
in
there
they
in
there
they
hai
come
out
yet
an
the
roof
has
caved
in
he
panted
they
be
burned
up
they
be
burned
up
margaret
sprang
forward
but
i
thought
they
were
all
out
she
cried
we
heard
that
every
one
was
out
who
in
there
what
do
you
mean
the
boy
gasped
for
breath
the
boss
bobby
mcginnis
an
spencer
frank
spencer
they
went
with
a
sharp
cry
margaret
turned
and
ran
through
the
open
door
to
the
street
nor
did
she
slacken
her
pace
until
she
had
reached
the
surging
crowds
at
the
mills
from
a
score
of
trembling
lips
she
learned
the
story
told
in
sobbing
broken
scraps
of
words
frank
and
ned
spencer
together
with
mcginnis
had
worked
side
by
side
with
the
firemen
in
clearing
the
mills
of
the
frightened
men
women
and
children
it
was
not
until
after
word
came
that
all
were
out
that
frank
spencer
and
mcginnis
were
reported
to
be
still
in
the
burning
building
five
minutes
later
there
came
a
terrific
crash
and
a
roar
of
flames
as
a
portion
of
the
walls
and
the
roof
caved
in
since
then
neither
one
of
the
two
men
had
been
seen
there
was
more
much
more
tales
of
brave
rescues
and
stories
of
children
restored
to
frantically
outstretched
arms
but
margaret
did
not
hear
with
eyes
and
numbed
senses
she
shrank
back
from
the
crowd
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
in
helpless
misery
there
ned
found
her
margaret
you
and
here
no
no
you
must
not
you
can
do
no
good
let
me
take
you
home
do
dear
he
implored
margaret
shook
her
head
ned
he
ca
be
dead
not
dead
she
moaned
ned
face
grew
white
for
an
instant
he
was
almost
angry
with
the
girl
who
had
so
plainly
shown
that
to
her
there
was
but
one
man
that
had
gone
down
into
the
shadow
of
death
then
his
eyes
softened
after
all
it
was
natural
perhaps
that
she
should
think
of
her
lover
and
of
him
only
in
this
first
agonized
moment
margaret
dear
come
home
he
pleaded
ned
he
is
dead
not
dead
moaned
the
girl
again
why
do
you
tell
me
he
is
dead
ned
shuddered
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
blackened
blazing
pile
before
him
as
if
a
man
could
be
there
and
live
margaret
followed
his
gaze
and
understood
but
he
he
may
not
have
gone
in
again
ned
he
may
not
have
gone
in
again
she
cried
feverishly
he
he
is
out
here
somewhere
we
will
find
him
come
come
we
must
find
him
and
she
tugged
at
his
arm
ned
caught
at
the
straw
no
no
not
you
you
could
do
nothing
here
but
i
go
he
said
and
i
promise
to
bring
you
the
very
first
word
that
i
can
come
now
you
go
home
surely
margaret
gazed
about
her
everywhere
were
men
confusion
smoke
and
water
the
fire
was
clearly
under
control
and
the
flames
were
fast
hissing
into
silence
over
in
the
east
the
sun
was
rising
a
new
day
had
begun
a
day
of
she
suddenly
remembered
the
sufferers
back
at
the
mill
house
she
turned
about
sharply
yes
i
go
she
choked
i
go
back
to
the
mill
house

do
something
there
and
i
ca

anything

but
ned
you
will
bring
me
word
soon
wo
you
soon
and
before
ned
could
attempt
to
follow
her
she
had
turned
and
was
lost
in
the
crowd
chapter
xxxviii
tuesday
was
a
day
that
was
not
soon
forgotten
at
the
mills
scarcely
waiting
for
the
smoking
timbers
to
cool
swarms
of
workmen
attacked
the
ruins
and
attempted
to
clear
their
way
to
the
point
where
spencer
and
mcginnis
had
last
been
seen
fortunately
that
portion
of
the
building
had
only
been
touched
by
the
fire
and
it
was
evident
that
the
floors
and
roof
had
been
carried
down
with
the
fall
of
those
nearest
to
it
for
this
reason
there
was
the
more
hope
of
finding
the
bodies
unharmed
by
fire
perhaps
even
of
finding
a
spark
of
life
in
one
or
both
of
them
this
last
hope
however
was
sorrowfully
abandoned
when
hour
after
hour
passed
with
no
sign
of
the
missing
men
all
night
they
worked
by
the
aid
of
numerous
electric
lights
hastily
placed
to
illuminate
the
scene
and
when
wednesday
morning
came
a
new
shift
of
workers
took
up
the
task
that
had
come
to
be
now
merely
a
search
for
the
dead
so
convinced
was
every
one
of
this
that
the
men
gazed
with
blanched
faces
into
each
other
eyes
when
there
came
a
distinct
rapping
on
a
projecting
timber
near
them
in
the
dazed
silence
that
followed
a
faint
cry
came
from
beneath
their
feet
with
a
shout
and
a
ringing
cheer
the
men
fell
to
work
it
was
no
ghost
but
a
living
human
voice
that
had
called
they
labored
more
cautiously
now
lest
their
very
zeal
for
rescue
should
bring
defeat
in
the
shape
of
falling
brick
or
timber
ned
spencer
who
had
not
left
the
mills
all
night
heard
the
cheer
and
hurried
forward
it
was
he
who
when
the
men
paused
again
called
frank
are
you
there
yes
ned
the
voice
was
faint
but
distinctly
audible
and
mcginnis
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
the
listeners
held
their
breath
perhaps
after
all
they
had
been
dreaming
and
there
was
no
voice
then
it
came
again
yes
he
lying
beside
me
but
he
unconscious
or
dead
the
last
word
was
almost
inaudible
so
faint
was
it
but
the
tightening
of
ned
lips
showed
that
he
had
heard
it
none
the
less
in
a
moment
he
stooped
again
keep
up
your
courage
old
fellow
we
have
you
out
of
that
soon
then
he
stepped
aside
and
gave
the
signal
for
the
men
to
fall
to
work
again
rapidly
eagerly
but
oh
so
cautiously
they
worked
at
the
next
pause
the
voice
was
nearer
so
near
that
they
could
drop
through
a
small
hole
a
rubber
tube
four
feet
long
lowering
it
until
spencer
could
put
his
mouth
to
it
through
this
tube
he
was
given
a
stimulant
and
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
they
learned
then
a
little
more
of
what
had
happened
the
two
men
were
on
the
fourth
floor
when
the
crash
came
they
had
been
swept
down
and
had
been
caught
between
the
timbers
in
such
a
way
that
as
they
lay
where
they
had
been
flung
a
roof
three
feet
above
their
heads
supported
the
crushing
weight
above
spencer
could
remember
nothing
after
the
first
crash
until
he
regained
consciousness
long
afterward
and
heard
the
workmen
far
above
him
it
was
then
that
he
had
tapped
his
signal
on
the
projecting
timber
he
had
tapped
three
times
before
he
had
been
heard
at
first
it
was
dark
he
said
and
he
could
not
see
but
he
knew
that
mcginnis
was
near
him
mcginnis
had
spoken
once
then
had
apparently
dropped
into
unconsciousness
at
all
events
he
had
said
nothing
since
still
spencer
did
not
think
he
was
dead
once
more
the
rescuers
fell
to
work
and
it
was
then
that
ned
spencer
hurried
away
to
send
a
message
of
hope
and
comfort
to
merideth
who
had
long
since
left
the
great
house
on
the
hill
and
had
come
down
to
the
mill
house
to
be
with
margaret
to
margaret
ned
wrote
the
one
word
come
and
as
he
expected
he
had
not
long
to
wait
you
have
found
him
cried
the
girl
hurrying
toward
him
ned
he
is
dead
ned
smiled
and
put
out
a
steadying
hand
we
hope
not
and
we
think
not
but
he
is
unconscious
margaret
get
your
hopes
too
high
i
had
to
send
for
you
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
what
we
know
but
where
is
he
have
you
seen
him
ned
shook
his
head
no
but
frank
says
but
you
said
frank
was
unconscious
no
no
they
are
both
unconscious
it
is
only
mcginnis
it
is
frank
who
told
us
the
story
he
why
margaret
but
margaret
was
gone
and
as
ned
watched
her
flying
form
disappear
toward
the
mill
house
he
wondered
if
after
all
the
last
hours
of
horror
had
turned
her
brain
in
no
other
way
could
he
account
for
her
words
and
for
this
most
extraordinary
flight
just
at
the
critical
moment
when
she
might
learn
the
best
and
the
worst
of
what
had
come
to
her
lover
to
ned
it
seemed
that
the
girl
must
be
mad
he
could
not
know
that
in
margaret
little
room
at
the
mill
house
some
minutes
later
a
girl
went
down
on
her
knees
and
sobbed
to
think
that
was
bobby
at
all
that
i
was
thinking
of
bobby
at
all
was
never
bobby
that
had
my
first
thought
was
always
even
to
herself
margaret
would
not
say
the
name
and
only
her
sobs
finished
the
sentence
chapter
xxxix
robert
mcginnis
was
not
dead
when
he
was
tenderly
lifted
from
his
prison
but
he
was
still
unconscious
in
spite
of
their
marvelous
escape
from
death
both
he
and
his
employer
were
suffering
from
breaks
and
bruises
that
would
call
for
the
best
of
care
and
nursing
for
weeks
to
come
and
it
seemed
best
for
all
concerned
that
this
care
and
nursing
should
be
given
at
the
mill
house
a
removal
to
hilcrest
in
their
present
condition
would
not
be
wise
the
physicians
said
and
the
little
town
hospital
was
already
overflowing
with
patients
there
was
really
no
place
but
the
mill
house
and
to
the
mill
house
they
were
carried
at
the
mill
house
everything
possible
was
done
for
their
comfort
two
large
airy
rooms
were
given
up
to
their
use
and
the
entire
household
was
devoted
to
their
service
the
children
that
had
been
brought
there
the
night
of
the
fire
were
gone
and
there
was
no
one
with
whom
the
two
injured
men
must
share
the
care
and
attention
that
were
lavished
upon
them
trained
nurses
were
promptly
sent
for
and
installed
in
their
positions
aside
from
these
whitecapped
women
margaret
and
the
little
lame
arabella
were
the
most
frequently
seen
in
the
sickrooms
we
the
ornamental
part
margaret
would
say
brightly
we
do
the
reading
and
the
singing
and
the
amusing
arabella
was
a
born
nurse
so
both
the
patients
said
there
was
something
peculiarly
soothing
in
the
soft
touch
of
her
hands
and
in
the
low
tones
of
her
voice
she
was
happy
in
it
too
her
eyes
almost
lost
their
wistful
look
sometimes
so
absorbed
would
she
be
in
her
task
as
for
margaret
margaret
was
a
born
nurse
too
and
both
the
patients
said
that
though
one
of
the
patients
it
is
true
complained
sometimes
that
she
did
not
give
him
half
a
chance
to
know
it
margaret
certainly
did
not
divide
her
time
evenly
any
one
could
see
that
no
one
however
not
even
frank
spencer
himself
could
really
question
the
propriety
of
her
devoting
herself
more
exclusively
to
young
mcginnis
the
man
she
had
promised
to
marry
margaret
was
particularly
bright
and
cheerful
these
days
but
to
a
close
observer
there
was
something
a
little
forced
about
it
no
one
seemed
to
notice
it
however
except
mcginnis
he
watched
her
sometimes
with
somber
eyes
but
even
he
said
nothing
until
the
day
before
he
was
to
leave
the
mill
house
then
he
spoke
margaret
he
began
gently
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
i
am
going
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
and
i
want
you
to
be
so
with
me
will
you
why
of
of
course
faltered
margaret
nervously
her
eyes
carefully
avoiding
his
steady
gaze
then
hopefully
but
bobby
really
i
think
you
should
talk
not
not
about
anything
that
that
needs
that
tone
of
voice
let
let
read
something
bobby
shook
his
head
decidedly
no
i
quite
strong
enough
to
talk
in
fact
i
wanted
to
say
this
for
some
time
but
i
waited
until
so
i
could
say
it
margaret
you
you
do
love
me
any
longer
oh
bobby
why
there
was
dismayed
distress
in
voice
when
one
has
for
some
weeks
been
trying
to
lash
one
self
into
a
certain
state
of
mind
and
heart
for
the
express
sake
of
some
other
one
it
is
distressing
to
have
that
other
one
so
abruptly
and
so
positively
show
that
one
labor
has
been
worse
than
useless
you
do
not
margaret
you
know
that
you
do
not
why
bobby
what
what
makes
you
say
such
a
dreadful
thing
cried
the
girl
reaching
blindly
out
for
some
support
that
would
not
fail
as
if
i
did
know
my
own
mind
bobby
was
silent
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
shook
a
little
i
will
tell
you
what
makes
me
say
it
for
some
time
i
suspected
it
that
you
did
not
love
me
but
after
the
fire
i
i
knew
it
you
knew
it
yes
when
a
girl
loves
a
man
and
that
man
has
come
back
almost
from
the
dead
she
goes
to
him
first
if
she
loves
him
when
frank
spencer
and
i
were
brought
into
the
hall
that
wednesday
morning
the
jar
or
something
brought
back
my
senses
for
a
moment
just
long
enough
for
me
to
hear
your
cry
of
and
to
see
you
hurry
to
his
side
margaret
caught
her
breath
sharply
her
face
grew
white
but
bobby
you
you
were
unconscious
i
supposed
she
stammered
faintly
i
did
think
you
could
answer
me
if
if
i
did
go
to
you
but
you
did
not
come
to
see
the
words
were
spoken
gently
tenderly
sorrowfully
margaret
gave
a
low
cry
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
a
look
that
was
almost
relief
came
to
the
man
face
there
he
sighed
now
you
admit
it
we
can
talk
sensibly
and
reasonably
margaret
why
have
you
tried
to
keep
it
up
all
these
weeks
when
it
was
just
killing
you
i
wanted
to
make
you
happy
came
miserably
from
behind
the
hands
and
did
you
think
i
could
be
made
happy
that
way
by
your
wretchedness
there
was
no
answer
i
seen
it
coming
for
a
long
time
he
went
on
gently
and
i
did
not
blame
you
i
could
never
have
made
you
happy
and
i
knew
it
almost
from
the
first
i
was
happy
either
because
i
could
make
you
so
perhaps
now
i
i
shall
be
happier
who
knows
he
asked
with
a
wan
little
smile
margaret
sobbed
it
was
so
like
bobby
to
belittle
his
own
grief
just
to
make
it
easier
for
her
you
see
it
was
for
only
the
work
that
you
cared
for
me
resumed
the
man
after
a
minute
you
loved
that
and
you
thought
you
loved
me
but
it
was
only
the
work
all
the
time
dear
i
understand
that
now
you
see
i
watched
you
and
i
watched
him
him
margaret
hands
were
down
and
she
was
looking
at
bobby
with
startled
eyes
yes
i
used
to
think
he
loved
you
even
then
but
after
the
fire
and
i
heard
your
cry
of
margaret
sprang
to
her
feet
bobby
bobby
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
she
cried
agitatedly
spencer
does
not
love
me
and
he
never
loved
me
why
bobby
he
could
he
even
pleaded
with
me
to
marry
another
man
he
pleaded
with
you
bobby
eyes
were
puzzled
yes
now
bobby
surely
you
understand
that
he
does
love
me
surely
you
must
see
bobby
threw
a
quick
look
into
the
flushed
quivering
face
then
hastily
turned
his
eyes
away
yes
i
see
he
said
almost
savagely
and
he
did
see
more
than
he
wanted
to
but
he
did
not
understand
how
a
man
have
the
love
of
margaret
kendall
and
not
want
it
was
beyond
the
wildest
flights
of
his
fancy
chapter
xl
frank
spencer
had
already
left
the
mill
house
and
gone
to
hilcrest
when
mcginnis
was
well
enough
to
go
back
to
his
place
in
the
mills
the
mills
in
spite
of
the
loss
of
the
two
buildings
which
were
being
rapidly
rebuilt
were
running
full
time
and
needed
him
greatly
particularly
as
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
had
not
entirely
regained
his
old
health
and
strength
for
some
time
after
mcginnis
went
away
margaret
remained
at
the
mill
house
but
she
was
restless
and
unhappy
in
the
position
in
which
she
found
herself
mcginnis
taught
an
evening
class
at
the
mill
house
and
she
knew
that
it
could
not
be
easy
for
him
to
see
her
so
frequently
now
that
the
engagement
was
broken
margaret
blamed
herself
bitterly
not
for
the
broken
engagement
but
for
the
fact
that
there
had
ever
been
any
engagement
at
all
she
told
herself
that
she
ought
to
have
known
that
the
feeling
she
had
for
bobby
was
not
love
and
she
asked
herself
scornfully
what
she
thought
of
a
young
woman
who
could
give
that
love
all
unsought
to
a
man
who
was
so
very
indifferent
as
to
beg
her
favor
for
another
those
long
hours
of
misery
when
the
mills
burned
had
opened
margaret
eyes
and
now
that
her
eyes
were
opened
she
was
frightened
and
ashamed
it
seemed
to
margaret
as
she
thought
of
it
that
there
was
no
way
for
her
to
turn
but
to
leave
both
the
mill
house
and
hilcrest
for
a
time
bobby
would
be
happier
with
her
away
and
the
mill
house
did
not
need
her
clarabella
had
come
from
new
york
and
had
materially
strengthened
the
teaching
force
as
for
hilcrest
she
certainly
would
not
stay
at
hilcrest
anyway
now
later
when
she
had
come
to
her
senses
perhaps
but
not
now
it
did
not
take
much
persuasion
on
the
part
of
margaret
to
convince
merideth
that
a
winter
abroad
would
be
delightful
just
they
two
together
the
news
of
margaret
broken
engagement
had
been
received
at
hilcrest
with
a
joyous
relief
that
was
nevertheless
carefully
subdued
in
the
presence
of
margaret
herself
but
merideth
could
not
conceal
her
joy
that
she
was
to
take
margaret
away
from
the
whole
unfortunate
affair
as
she
expressed
it
to
her
brothers
frank
spencer
however
was
not
so
pleased
at
the
proposed
absence
he
could
see
no
reason
for
margaret
going
and
one
evening
when
they
were
alone
together
in
the
library
he
spoke
of
it
but
margaret
i
do
see
why
you
must
go
he
protested
for
a
moment
the
girl
was
silent
then
she
turned
swiftly
and
faced
him
frank
bobby
mcginnis
was
my
good
friend
from
the
time
when
i
was
a
tiny
little
girl
he
has
been
that
he
is
good
and
true
and
noble
but
i
have
brought
him
nothing
but
sorrow
he
will
be
happier
now
if
i
am
quite
out
of
his
sight
at
present
i
am
going
away
frank
spencer
stirred
uneasily
but
you
will
be
away
from
him
if
you
are
here
he
suggested
oh
but
if
i
here
i
shall
be
there
contested
margaret
with
a
haste
that
refused
to
consider
logic
then
as
she
saw
the
whimsical
smile
come
into
the
man
eyes
she
added
brokenly
besides
i
want
to
get
away
quite
away
from
my
work
spencer
grew
sober
instantly
the
whimsical
look
in
his
eyes
gave
place
to
one
of
tender
sympathy
you
poor
child
of
course
you
do
and
no
wonder
you
are
worn
out
with
the
strain
margaret
she
raised
a
protesting
hand
no
no
you
do
not
understand
i
i
have
made
a
failure
of
it
a
failure
of
it
yes
i
want
to
get
away
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
and
see
if
i
ca
find
out
what
is
the
trouble
with
it
just
as
as
artists
do
you
know
when
they
paint
a
picture
there
was
a
feverishness
in
manner
and
a
tremulousness
in
her
voice
that
came
perilously
near
to
tears
but
my
dear
margaret
argued
the
man
there
nothing
the
matter
with
it
it
no
failure
at
all
you
done
wonders
down
there
at
the
mill
house
margaret
shook
her
head
slowly
it
so
little
so
very
little
compared
to
what
ought
to
be
done
she
sighed
the
mill
house
is
good
and
does
good
i
acknowledge
but
so
puny
after
all
it
like
a
tiny
little
oasis
in
a
huge
desert
of
poverty
and
distress
but
what
what
more
could
you
do
ventured
the
man
margaret
rose
and
moved
restlessly
around
the
room
i
do
know
she
said
at
last
that
what
i
mean
to
find
out
she
stopped
suddenly
facing
him
do
you
see
i
touch
only
the
surface
the
great
cause
behind
things
i
never
reach
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
it
were
like
that
old
picture
where
was
it
in
pilgrim
progress
of
the
fire
on
one
side
is
the
man
trying
to
put
it
out
on
the
other
is
the
evil
one
pouring
on
oil
my
two
hands
are
the
two
men
with
one
i
feed
a
hungry
child
or
nurse
a
sick
woman
with
the
other
i
make
more
children
hungry
and
more
women
sick
margaret
are
you
mad
what
can
you
mean
merely
this
it
is
very
simple
after
all
with
one
hand
i
relieve
the
children
suffering
with
the
other
i
take
dividends
from
the
very
mills
that
make
the
children
suffer
a
long
time
ago
i
wanted
to
up
with
patty
and
bobby
and
the
rest
i
have
even
thought
lately
that
i
would
still
like
to
up
and
well
you
can
see
the
way
i
am
up
now
with
my
people
down
there
at
the
mills
and
her
voice
rang
with
the
man
frowned
he
too
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
nervously
up
and
down
the
room
when
he
came
back
the
girl
had
sat
down
again
her
elbows
were
on
the
table
and
her
linked
fingers
were
shielding
her
eyes
involuntarily
the
man
reached
his
hand
toward
the
bowed
head
but
he
drew
it
back
before
it
had
touched
a
thread
of
the
hair
i
do
see
margaret
he
began
gently
and
you
are
right
it
is
at
the
mills
themselves
that
the
first
start
must
be
made
the
first
beginning
of
the
up
perhaps
if
there
were
some
one
to
show
us
he
paused
then
went
on
unsteadily
i
suppose
it
useless
to
say
again
what
i
said
that
day
months
ago
that
if
you
stayed
here
and
showed
him
the
man
who
loves
you
the
better
way
margaret
started
she
gave
a
nervous
little
laugh
and
picked
up
a
bit
of
paper
from
the
floor
of
course
it
is
useless
she
retorted
in
what
she
hoped
was
a
merry
voice
and
he
does
even
love
me
now
besides
he
does
love
you
frank
spencer
eyes
and
voice
were
amazed
of
course
not
he
never
did
for
that
matter
was
only
the
fancy
of
a
moment
why
frank
ned
never
cared
for
me
that
way
the
tone
and
the
one
word
were
enough
for
one
moment
margaret
gazed
into
the
man
face
with
startled
eyes
then
she
turned
and
covered
her
own
telltale
face
with
her
hands
and
because
it
was
a
telltale
face
spencer
took
a
long
stride
toward
her
margaret
and
did
you
think
it
was
ned
i
was
pleading
for
when
all
the
while
it
was
i
who
was
hungering
for
you
with
a
love
that
sent
me
across
the
seas
to
rid
myself
of
it
did
you
margaret
there
was
no
answer
margaret
look
at
me
let
me
see
your
eyes
there
was
a
note
of
triumphant
joy
in
his
voice
now
still
no
answer
margaret
it
did
not
go
that
love
it
stayed
with
me
day
after
day
and
month
after
month
and
it
only
grew
stronger
and
deeper
until
there
was
nothing
left
me
in
all
this
world
but
you
just
you
and
now
margaret
my
margaret
he
said
softly
and
very
tenderly
you
my
margaret
and
his
arms
closed
about
her
chapter
xli
in
spite
of
protests
and
pleadings
margaret
spent
the
winter
abroad
as
if
i
stay
here
and
flaunt
my
happiness
in
poor
bobby
face
she
said
indignantly
to
her
lover
neither
would
she
consent
to
a
formal
engagement
even
merideth
and
ned
were
not
to
know
it
is
to
be
just
as
it
was
before
she
had
declared
decidedly
only
well
you
may
write
to
me
she
had
conceded
i
refuse
to
stay
here
and
and
be
just
happy
i
been
unkind
and
thoughtless
and
have
brought
sorrow
to
my
dear
good
friend
i
going
away
i
deserve
it
and
bobby
deserves
it
too
and
in
spite
of
frank
spencer
efforts
to
make
her
see
matters
in
a
different
light
she
still
adhered
to
her
purpose
all
through
the
long
winter
frank
contented
himself
with
writing
voluminous
letters
and
telling
her
of
the
plans
he
was
making
to
divvy
up
at
the
mills
as
he
always
called
it
i
shall
make
mistakes
of
course
dear
he
wrote
it
is
a
big
problem
altogether
more
so
than
perhaps
you
realize
of
course
the
mills
must
still
be
a
business
not
a
philanthropy
otherwise
we
should
defeat
our
own
ends
but
i
shall
have
your
clear
head
and
warm
heart
to
aid
me
and
little
by
little
we
shall
win
success
already
i
have
introduced
two
or
three
small
changes
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
larger
ones
later
on
even
ned
is
getting
interested
and
seems
to
approve
of
my
work
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
will
own
thinking
however
that
i
not
the
only
one
in
the
house
sweetheart
to
whom
you
and
your
unselfishness
have
shown
the
way
month
by
month
the
winter
passed
and
spring
came
bringing
merideth
but
no
margaret
she
has
stopped
to
visit
friends
in
new
york
explained
merideth
in
reply
to
her
brother
anxious
questions
she
may
go
on
west
with
them
she
said
she
would
write
you
margaret
did
go
on
west
and
it
was
while
she
was
still
in
the
west
that
she
received
a
letter
from
patty
a
portion
of
which
ran
thus
mebbe
youd
like
to
know
about
bobby
mcginnis
bobby
is
goin
to
get
married
she
seemed
to
comfort
him
lots
after
you
went
shes
that
pretty
and
sympathizing
in
her
ways
you
know
i
think
he
was
kind
of
surprised
hisself
but
the
first
thing
he
knew
he
was
in
love
with
her
i
think
he
felt
kind
of
bad
at
first
on
account
of
you
but
i
told
him
that
was
all
nonsense
and
that
i
knew
youd
want
him
to
do
it
i
think
his
feelins
for
you
was
more
worship
than
love
anyhow
he
did
never
seem
happy
even
when
he
was
engaged
to
you
but
hes
happy
now
and
arabella
thinks
hes
jest
perfect
oh
i
told
you
twas
arabella
did
i
well
tis
and
say
its
her
thats
been
learnin
me
to
spell
ai
it
jest
grand
not
very
many
days
later
frank
spencer
at
hilcrest
received
a
small
card
on
which
had
been
written
patty
durgin
announces
the
engagement
of
her
sister
arabella
murphy
to
robert
mcginnis
beneath
in
very
fine
letters
was
i
coming
home
the
eighteenth
please
tell
della
and
you
may
tell
her
anything
else
that
you
like
margaret
for
a
moment
the
man
stared
at
the
card
with
puzzled
eyes
then
he
suddenly
understood
della
he
cried
joyously
a
minute
later
della
she
coming
the
eighteenth
who
coming
the
eighteenth
frank
hesitated
a
light
that
was
half
serious
half
whimsical
and
wholly
tender
came
into
his
eyes
my
wife
he
said
your
oh
you
know
her
as
margaret
kendall
retorted
frank
with
an
airiness
that
was
intended
to
hide
the
shake
in
his
voice
but
she
will
be
my
wife
before
she
leaves
here
again
frank
cried
merideth
joyfully
you
do
mean
but
frank
was
gone
over
his
shoulder
however
he
had
tossed
a
smile
and
a
reassuring
nod
merideth
sank
back
with
a
sigh
of
content
it
exactly
what
i
always
hoped
would
happen
she
