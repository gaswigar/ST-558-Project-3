preface
probably
in
the
life
of
everyone
there
comes
a
time
when
he
is
inclined
to
go
over
again
the
events
great
and
small
which
have
made
up
the
incidents
of
his
work
and
pleasure
and
i
am
tempted
to
become
a
garrulous
old
man
and
tell
some
stories
of
men
and
things
which
have
happened
in
an
active
life
in
some
measure
i
have
been
associated
with
the
most
interesting
people
our
country
has
produced
especially
in
business
men
who
have
helped
largely
to
build
up
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
who
have
made
known
its
products
all
over
the
world
these
incidents
which
come
to
my
mind
to
speak
of
seemed
vitally
important
to
me
when
they
happened
and
they
still
stand
out
distinctly
in
my
memory
just
how
far
any
one
is
justified
in
keeping
what
he
regards
as
his
own
private
affairs
from
the
public
or
in
defending
himself
from
attacks
is
a
mooted
point
if
one
talks
about
one
experiences
there
is
a
natural
temptation
to
charge
one
with
traveling
the
easy
road
to
egotism
if
one
keeps
silence
the
inference
of
is
sometimes
even
more
difficult
to
meet
as
it
would
then
be
said
that
there
is
no
valid
defence
to
be
offered
it
has
not
been
my
custom
to
press
my
affairs
forward
into
public
gaze
but
i
have
come
to
see
that
if
my
family
and
friends
want
some
record
of
things
which
might
shed
light
on
matters
that
have
been
somewhat
discussed
it
is
right
that
i
should
yield
to
their
advice
and
in
this
informal
way
go
over
again
some
of
the
events
which
have
made
life
interesting
to
me
there
is
still
another
reason
for
speaking
now
if
a
tenth
of
the
things
that
have
been
said
are
true
then
these
dozens
of
able
and
faithful
men
who
have
been
associated
with
me
many
of
whom
have
passed
away
must
have
been
guilty
of
grave
faults
for
myself
i
had
decided
to
say
nothing
hoping
that
after
my
death
the
truth
would
gradually
come
to
the
surface
and
posterity
would
do
strict
justice
but
while
i
live
and
can
testify
to
certain
things
it
seems
fair
that
i
should
refer
to
some
points
which
i
hope
will
help
to
set
forth
several
happenings
in
a
new
light
i
am
convinced
that
they
have
not
been
fully
understood
all
these
things
affect
the
memories
of
men
who
are
dead
and
the
lives
of
men
who
are
living
and
it
is
only
reasonable
that
the
public
should
have
some
facts
to
draw
from
in
making
up
its
final
estimate
when
these
reminiscences
were
begun
there
was
of
course
no
thought
that
they
should
ever
go
so
far
as
to
appear
between
the
covers
of
a
book
they
were
not
prepared
with
the
idea
of
even
an
informal
autobiography
there
was
little
idea
of
order
or
sequence
and
no
thought
whatever
of
completeness
it
would
have
been
a
pleasure
as
well
as
a
satisfaction
to
dwell
with
some
fulness
upon
the
stories
of
daily
and
intimate
companionship
which
existed
for
so
many
years
with
my
close
partners
and
associates
but
i
realize
that
while
these
experiences
have
always
been
to
me
among
the
great
pleasures
of
my
life
a
long
account
of
them
would
not
interest
the
reader
and
thus
it
happens
that
i
have
but
mentioned
the
names
of
only
a
few
of
the
scores
of
partners
who
have
been
so
active
in
building
up
the
business
interests
with
which
i
have
been
associated

i
some

friends
since
these
reminiscences
are
really
what
they
profess
to
be
random
and
informal
i
hope
i
may
be
pardoned
for
setting
down
so
many
small
things
in
looking
back
over
my
life
the
impressions
which
come
most
vividly
to
my
mind
are
mental
pictures
of
my
old
associates
in
speaking
of
these
friends
in
this
chapter
i
would
not
have
it
thought
that
many
others
of
whom
i
have
not
spoken
were
less
important
to
me
and
i
shall
hope
to
refer
to
this
subject
of
my
early
friends
in
a
later
chapter
it
is
not
always
possible
to
remember
just
how
one
first
met
an
old
friend
or
what
one
impressions
were
but
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
meeting
with
john
archbold
who
is
now
a
of
the
standard
oil
company
at
that
time
say
or
forty
years
ago
i
was
travelling
about
the
country
visiting
the
point
where
something
was
happening
talking
with
the
producers
the
refiners
the
agents
and
actually
getting
acquainted
one
day
there
was
a
gathering
of
the
men
somewhere
near
the
oil
regions
and
when
i
came
to
the
hotel
which
was
full
of
oil
men
i
saw
this
name
writ
large
on
the
register
archbold
a
he
was
a
young
and
enthusiastic
fellow
so
full
of
his
subject
that
he
added
his
slogan
a
after
his
signature
on
the
register
that
no
one
might
misunderstand
his
convictions
the
battle
cry
of
a
barrel
was
all
the
more
striking
because
crude
oil
was
selling
then
for
much
less
and
this
campaign
for
a
higher
price
certainly
did
attract
attention
it
was
much
top
good
to
be
true
but
if
archbold
had
to
admit
in
the
end
that
crude
oil
is
not
worth
a
his
enthusiasm
his
energy
and
his
splendid
power
over
men
have
lasted
he
has
always
had
a
sense
of
humour
and
on
one
serious
occasion
when
he
was
on
the
witness
stand
he
was
asked
by
the
opposing
lawyer
archbold
are
you
a
director
of
this
company
i
am
what
is
your
occupation
in
this
company
he
promptly
answered
to
clamour
for
dividends
which
led
the
learned
counsel
to
start
afresh
on
another
line
i
can
never
cease
to
wonder
at
his
capacity
for
hard
work
i
do
not
often
see
him
now
for
he
has
great
affairs
on
his
hands
while
i
live
like
a
farmer
away
from
active
happenings
in
business
playing
golf
planting
trees
and
yet
i
am
so
busy
that
no
day
is
long
enough
speaking
of
archbold
leads
me
to
say
again
that
i
have
received
much
more
credit
than
i
deserve
in
connection
with
the
standard
oil
company
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
help
to
bring
together
the
efficient
men
who
are
the
controlling
forces
of
the
organization
and
to
work
hand
in
hand
with
them
for
many
years
but
it
is
they
who
have
done
the
hard
tasks
the
great
majority
of
my
associations
were
made
so
many
years
ago
that
i
have
reached
the
age
when
hardly
a
month
goes
by
sometimes
i
think
hardly
a
week
that
i
am
not
called
upon
to
send
some
message
of
consolation
to
a
family
with
whom
we
have
been
connected
and
who
have
met
with
some
fresh
bereavement
only
recently
i
counted
up
the
names
of
the
early
associates
who
have
passed
away
before
i
had
finished
i
found
the
list
numbered
some
sixty
or
more
they
were
faithful
and
earnest
friends
we
had
worked
together
through
many
difficulties
and
had
gone
through
many
severe
trials
together
we
had
discussed
and
argued
and
hammered
away
at
questions
until
we
came
to
agree
and
it
has
always
been
a
happiness
to
me
to
feel
that
we
had
been
frank
and
aboveboard
with
each
other
without
this
business
associates
can
not
get
the
best
out
of
their
work
it
is
not
always
the
easiest
of
tasks
to
induce
strong
forceful
men
to
agree
it
has
always
been
our
policy
to
hear
patiently
and
discuss
frankly
until
the
last
shred
of
evidence
is
on
the
table
before
trying
to
reach
a
conclusion
and
to
decide
finally
upon
a
course
of
action
in
working
with
so
many
partners
the
conservative
ones
are
apt
to
be
in
the
majority
and
this
is
no
doubt
a
desirable
thing
when
the
mere
momentum
of
a
large
concern
is
certain
to
carry
it
forward
the
men
who
have
been
very
successful
are
correspondingly
conservative
since
they
have
much
to
lose
in
case
of
disaster
but
fortunately
there
are
also
the
aggressive
and
more
daring
ones
and
they
are
usually
the
youngest
in
the
company
perhaps
few
in
number
but
impetuous
and
convincing
they
want
to
accomplish
things
and
to
move
quickly
and
they
do
mind
any
amount
of
work
or
responsibility
i
remember
in
particular
an
experience
when
the
conservative
influence
met
the
progressive
shall
i
say
or
the
daring
side
at
all
events
this
was
the
side
i
represented
in
this
case
arguments
versus
capital
one
of
my
partners
who
had
successfully
built
up
a
large
and
prosperous
business
was
resisting
with
all
his
force
a
plan
that
some
of
us
favoured
to
make
some
large
improvements
the
cost
of
extending
the
operations
of
this
enterprise
was
estimated
at
quite
a
sum
three
million
dollars
i
think
it
was
we
had
talked
it
over
and
over
again
and
with
several
other
associates
discussed
all
the
pros
and
cons
and
we
had
used
every
argument
we
could
command
to
show
why
the
plan
would
not
only
be
profitable
but
was
indeed
necessary
to
maintain
the
lead
we
had
our
old
partner
was
obdurate
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
yield
and
i
can
see
him
standing
up
in
his
vigorous
protest
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
thrown
back
as
he
shouted
no
it
a
pity
to
get
a
man
into
a
place
in
an
argument
where
he
is
defending
a
position
instead
of
considering
the
evidence
his
calm
judgment
is
apt
to
leave
him
and
his
mind
is
for
the
time
being
closed
and
only
obstinacy
remains
now
these
improvements
had
to
be
made
as
i
said
before
it
was
essential
yet
we
could
not
quarrel
with
our
old
partner
but
a
minority
of
us
had
made
up
our
minds
that
we
must
try
to
get
him
to
yield
and
we
resolved
to
try
another
line
of
argument
and
said
to
him
you
say
that
we
do
not
need
to
spend
this
money
no
he
replied
it
will
probably
prove
to
be
many
years
before
such
a
sum
must
be
spent
there
is
no
present
need
for
these
facilities
you
want
to
create
and
the
works
are
doing
well
as
they
are
let
let
well
enough
alone
now
our
partner
was
a
very
wise
and
experienced
man
older
and
more
familiar
with
the
subject
than
some
of
us
and
all
this
we
admitted
to
him
but
we
had
made
up
our
minds
as
i
have
said
to
carry
out
this
idea
if
we
could
possibly
get
his
approval
and
we
were
willing
to
wait
until
then
as
soon
as
the
argument
had
calmed
down
and
when
the
heat
of
our
discussion
had
passed
the
subject
was
brought
up
again
i
had
thought
of
a
new
way
to
approach
it
i
said
i
take
it
and
supply
this
capital
myself
if
the
expenditure
turns
out
to
be
profitable
the
company
can
repay
me
and
if
it
goes
wrong
i
stand
the
loss
that
was
the
argument
that
touched
him
all
his
reserve
disappeared
and
the
matter
was
settled
when
he
said
if
that
the
way
you
feel
about
it
we
go
it
together
i
guess
i
can
take
the
risk
if
you
can
it
is
always
i
presume
a
question
in
every
business
just
how
fast
it
is
wise
to
go
and
we
went
pretty
rapidly
in
those
days
building
and
expanding
in
all
directions
we
were
being
confronted
with
fresh
emergencies
constantly
a
new
oil
field
would
be
discovered
tanks
for
storage
had
to
be
built
almost
over
night
and
this
was
going
on
when
old
fields
were
being
exhausted
so
we
were
therefore
often
under
the
double
strain
of
losing
the
facilities
in
one
place
where
we
were
fully
equipped
and
having
to
build
up
a
plant
for
storing
and
transporting
in
a
new
field
where
we
were
totally
unprepared
these
are
some
of
the
things
which
make
the
whole
oil
trade
a
perilous
one
but
we
had
with
us
a
group
of
courageous
men
who
recognized
the
great
principle
that
a
business
can
not
be
a
great
success
that
does
not
fully
and
efficiently
accept
and
take
advantage
of
its
opportunities
how
often
we
discussed
those
trying
questions
some
of
us
wanted
to
jump
at
once
into
big
expenditures
and
others
to
keep
to
more
moderate
ones
it
was
usually
a
compromise
but
one
at
a
time
we
took
these
matters
up
and
settled
them
never
going
as
fast
as
the
most
progressive
ones
wished
nor
quite
so
carefully
as
the
conservatives
desired
but
always
made
the
vote
unanimous
in
the
end
the
joy
of
achievement
the
part
played
by
one
of
my
earliest
partners
flagler
was
always
an
inspiration
to
me
he
invariably
wanted
to
go
ahead
and
accomplish
great
projects
of
all
kinds
he
was
always
on
the
active
side
of
every
question
and
to
his
wonderful
energy
is
due
much
of
the
rapid
progress
of
the
company
in
the
early
days
it
was
to
be
expected
of
such
a
man
that
he
should
fulfil
his
destiny
by
working
out
some
great
problems
at
a
time
when
most
men
want
to
retire
to
a
comfortable
life
of
ease
this
would
not
appeal
to
my
old
friend
he
undertook
single
handed
the
task
of
building
up
the
east
coast
of
florida
he
was
not
satisfied
to
plan
a
railroad
from
augustine
to
key
west
a
distance
of
more
than
six
hundred
miles
which
would
have
been
regarded
as
an
undertaking
large
enough
for
almost
any
one
man
but
in
addition
he
has
built
a
chain
of
superb
hotels
to
induce
tourists
to
go
to
this
newly
developed
country
further
than
this
he
has
had
them
conducted
with
great
skill
and
success
this
one
man
by
his
own
energy
and
capital
has
opened
up
a
vast
stretch
of
country
so
that
the
old
inhabitants
and
the
new
settlers
may
have
a
market
for
their
products
he
has
given
work
to
thousands
of
these
people
and
to
crown
all
he
has
undertaken
and
nearly
completed
a
remarkable
engineering
feat
in
carrying
his
road
on
the
florida
keys
into
the
atlantic
ocean
to
key
west
the
point
set
out
for
years
ago
practically
all
this
has
been
done
after
what
most
men
would
have
considered
a
full
business
life
and
a
man
of
any
other
nationality
situated
as
he
was
would
have
retired
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
labour
i
first
knew
flagler
as
a
young
man
who
consigned
produce
to
clark
rockefeller
he
was
a
bright
and
active
young
fellow
full
of
vim
and
push
about
the
time
we
went
into
the
oil
business
flagler
established
himself
as
a
commission
merchant
in
the
same
building
with
clark
who
took
over
and
succeeded
the
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
a
little
later
he
bought
out
clark
and
combined
his
trade
with
his
own
naturally
i
came
to
see
more
of
him
the
business
relations
which
began
with
the
handling
of
produce
he
consigned
to
our
old
firm
grew
into
a
business
friendship
because
people
who
lived
in
a
comparatively
small
place
as
cleveland
was
then
were
thrown
together
much
more
often
than
in
such
a
place
as
new
york
when
the
oil
business
was
developing
and
we
needed
more
help
i
at
once
thought
of
flagler
as
a
possible
partner
and
made
him
an
offer
to
come
with
us
and
give
up
his
commission
business
this
offer
he
accepted
and
so
began
that
friendship
which
has
never
had
a
moment
interruption
it
was
a
friendship
founded
on
business
which
flagler
used
to
say
was
a
good
deal
better
than
a
business
founded
on
friendship
and
my
experience
leads
me
to
agree
with
him
for
years
and
years
this
early
partner
and
i
worked
shoulder
to
shoulder
our
desks
were
in
the
same
room
we
both
lived
on
euclid
avenue
a
few
rods
apart
we
met
and
walked
to
the
office
together
walked
home
to
luncheon
back
again
after
luncheon
and
home
again
at
night
on
these
walks
when
we
were
away
from
the
office
interruptions
we
did
our
thinking
talking
and
planning
together
flagler
drew
practically
all
our
contracts
he
has
always
had
the
faculty
of
being
able
to
clearly
express
the
intent
and
purpose
of
a
contract
so
well
and
accurately
that
there
could
be
no
misunderstanding
and
his
contracts
were
fair
to
both
sides
i
can
remember
his
saying
often
that
when
you
go
into
an
arrangement
you
must
measure
up
the
rights
and
proprieties
of
both
sides
with
the
same
yardstick
and
this
was
the
way
henry
flagler
did
one
contract
flagler
was
called
upon
to
accept
which
to
my
surprise
he
at
once
passed
with
his
and
without
a
question
we
had
concluded
to
purchase
the
land
on
which
one
of
our
refineries
was
built
and
which
was
held
on
a
lease
from
john
irwin
whom
we
both
knew
well
irwin
drew
the
contract
for
the
purchase
of
this
land
on
the
back
of
a
large
manila
envelope
that
he
picked
up
in
the
office
the
description
of
the
property
ran
as
such
contracts
usually
do
until
it
came
to
the
phrase
the
line
runs
south
to
a
mullen
stalk
etc
this
seemed
to
me
a
trifle
indefinite
but
flagler
said
it
all
right
john
i
accept
that
contract
and
when
the
deed
comes
in
you
will
see
that
the
mullen
stalk
will
be
replaced
by
a
proper
stake
and
the
whole
document
will
be
accurate
and
shipshape
of
course
it
turned
out
exactly
as
he
said
it
would
i
am
almost
tempted
to
say
that
some
lawyers
might
sit
at
his
feet
and
learn
things
about
drawing
contracts
good
for
them
to
know
but
perhaps
our
legal
friends
might
think
i
was
partial
so
i
wo
press
the
point
another
thing
about
flagler
for
which
i
think
he
deserves
great
credit
was
that
in
the
early
days
he
insisted
that
when
a
refinery
was
to
be
put
up
it
should
be
different
from
the
flimsy
shacks
which
it
was
then
the
custom
to
build
everyone
was
so
afraid
that
the
oil
would
disappear
and
that
the
money
expended
in
buildings
would
be
a
loss
that
the
meanest
and
cheapest
buildings
were
erected
for
use
as
refineries
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
flagler
objected
to
while
he
had
to
admit
that
it
was
possible
the
oil
supply
might
fail
and
that
the
risks
of
the
trade
were
great
he
always
believed
that
if
we
went
into
the
oil
business
at
all
we
should
do
the
work
as
well
as
we
knew
how
that
we
should
have
the
very
best
facilities
that
everything
should
be
solid
and
substantial
and
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
to
produce
the
finest
results
and
he
followed
his
convictions
of
building
as
though
the
trade
was
going
to
last
and
his
courage
in
acting
up
to
his
beliefs
laid
strong
foundations
for
later
years
there
are
a
number
of
people
still
alive
who
will
recall
the
bright
straightforward
young
flagler
of
those
days
with
satisfaction
at
the
time
when
we
bought
certain
refineries
at
cleveland
he
was
very
active
one
day
he
met
an
old
friend
on
the
street
a
german
baker
to
whom
he
had
sold
flour
in
years
gone
by
his
friend
told
him
that
he
had
gone
out
of
the
bakery
business
and
had
built
a
little
refinery
this
surprised
flagler
and
he
did
like
the
idea
of
his
friend
investing
his
little
fortune
in
a
small
plant
which
he
felt
sure
would
not
succeed
but
at
first
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
about
it
he
had
it
on
his
mind
for
some
days
it
evidently
troubled
him
finally
he
came
to
me
and
said
that
little
baker
man
knows
more
about
baking
than
oil
refining
but
i
feel
better
if
we
invited
him
to
join
us
i
got
him
on
my
conscience
i
of
course
agreed
he
talked
to
his
friend
who
said
he
would
gladly
sell
if
we
would
send
an
appraiser
to
value
his
plant
which
we
did
and
then
there
arose
an
unexpected
difficulty
the
price
at
which
the
plant
was
to
be
purchased
was
satisfactory
but
the
insisted
that
flagler
should
advise
him
whether
he
should
take
his
pay
in
cash
or
standard
oil
certificates
at
par
he
told
flagler
that
if
he
took
it
in
cash
it
would
pay
all
his
debts
and
he
would
be
glad
to
have
his
mind
free
of
many
anxieties
but
if
flagler
said
the
certificates
were
going
to
pay
good
dividends
he
wanted
to
get
into
and
keep
up
with
a
good
thing
it
was
rather
a
hard
proposition
to
put
up
to
flagler
and
at
first
he
declined
to
advise
or
express
any
opinion
but
the
german
stuck
to
him
and
would
let
him
shirk
a
responsibility
which
in
no
way
belonged
to
him
finally
flagler
suggested
that
he
take
half
the
amount
in
cash
and
pay
per
cent
on
account
of
his
debts
and
put
the
other
half
in
certificates
and
see
what
happened
this
he
did
and
as
time
went
on
he
bought
more
certificates
and
flagler
never
had
to
apologize
for
the
advice
he
gave
him
i
am
confident
that
my
old
partner
gave
this
affair
as
much
time
and
thought
as
he
did
to
any
of
his
own
large
problems
and
the
incident
may
be
taken
as
a
measure
of
the
man
the
value
of
friendships
but
these
old
men
tales
can
hardly
be
interesting
to
the
present
generation
though
perhaps
they
will
not
be
useless
if
even
tiresome
stories
make
young
people
realize
how
above
all
other
possessions
is
the
value
of
a
friend
in
every
department
of
life
without
any
exception
whatsoever
how
many
different
kinds
of
friends
there
are
they
should
all
be
held
close
at
any
cost
for
although
some
are
better
than
others
perhaps
a
friend
of
whatever
kind
is
important
and
this
one
learns
as
one
grows
older
there
is
the
kind
that
when
you
need
help
has
a
good
reason
just
at
the
moment
of
course
why
it
is
impossible
to
extend
it
i
ca
indorse
your
note
he
says
because
i
have
an
agreement
with
my
partners
not
to
i
like
to
oblige
you
but
i
can
explain
why
at
the
moment
etc
i
do
not
mean
to
criticize
this
sort
of
friendship
for
sometimes
it
is
a
matter
of
temperament
and
sometimes
the
real
necessities
are
such
that
the
friend
can
not
do
as
he
would
like
to
do
as
i
look
back
over
my
friends
i
can
remember
only
a
few
of
this
kind
and
a
good
many
of
the
more
capable
sort
one
especial
friend
i
had
his
name
was
harkness
and
from
the
first
of
our
acquaintance
he
seemed
to
have
every
confidence
in
me
one
day
our
oil
warehouses
and
refinery
burned
to
the
ground
in
a
few
hours
they
were
absolutely
annihilated
though
they
were
insured
for
many
hundred
thousands
of
dollars
of
course
we
were
apprehensive
about
collecting
such
a
large
amount
of
insurance
and
feared
it
might
take
some
time
to
arrange
that
plant
had
to
be
rebuilt
right
away
and
it
was
necessary
to
lay
the
financial
plans
harkness
was
interested
with
us
in
the
business
and
i
said
to
him
i
may
want
to
call
upon
you
for
the
use
of
some
money
i
do
know
that
we
shall
need
it
but
i
thought
i
speak
to
you
in
advance
about
it
he
took
in
the
situation
without
much
explaining
on
my
part
he
simply
heard
what
i
had
to
say
and
he
was
a
man
of
very
few
words
all
right
i
give
you
all
i
got
this
was
all
he
said
but
i
went
home
that
night
relieved
of
anxiety
as
it
turned
out
we
received
the
check
of
the
liverpool
london
globe
insurance
company
for
the
full
amount
before
the
builders
required
the
payments
and
while
we
did
need
his
money
i
never
shall
forget
the
way
in
which
he
offered
it
and
this
sort
of
experience
was
not
i
am
grateful
to
say
rare
with
me
i
was
always
a
great
borrower
in
my
early
days
the
business
was
active
and
growing
fast
and
the
banks
seemed
very
willing
to
loan
me
the
money
about
this
time
when
our
great
fire
had
brought
up
some
new
conditions
i
was
studying
the
situation
to
see
what
our
cash
requirements
would
be
we
were
accustomed
to
prepare
for
financial
emergencies
long
before
we
needed
the
funds
another
incident
occurred
at
this
time
which
showed
again
the
kind
of
real
friends
we
had
in
those
days
but
i
did
not
hear
the
full
story
of
it
until
long
years
after
the
event
there
was
one
bank
where
we
had
done
a
great
deal
of
business
and
a
friend
of
mine
stillman
witt
who
was
a
rich
man
was
one
of
the
directors
at
a
meeting
the
question
came
up
as
to
what
the
bank
would
do
in
case
we
wanted
more
money
in
order
that
no
one
might
doubt
his
own
position
on
the
subject
witt
called
for
his
and
said
here
gentlemen
these
young
men
are
all
and
if
they
want
to
borrow
more
money
i
want
to
see
this
bank
advance
it
without
hesitation
and
if
you
want
more
security
here
it
is
take
what
you
want
we
were
then
shipping
a
large
quantity
of
oil
by
lake
and
canal
to
save
in
transportation
and
it
took
additional
capital
to
carry
these
shipments
and
we
required
to
borrow
a
large
amount
of
money
we
had
already
made
extensive
loans
from
another
bank
whose
president
informed
me
that
his
board
of
directors
had
been
making
inquiries
respecting
our
large
line
of
discounts
and
had
stated
that
they
would
probably
want
to
talk
with
me
on
the
subject
i
answered
that
i
would
be
very
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
board
as
we
would
require
a
great
deal
more
money
from
the
bank
suffice
it
to
say
we
got
all
we
wanted
but
i
was
not
asked
to
call
for
any
further
explanations
but
i
fear
i
am
telling
too
much
about
banks
and
money
and
business
i
know
of
nothing
more
despicable
and
pathetic
than
a
man
who
devotes
all
the
waking
hours
of
the
day
to
making
money
for
money
sake
if
i
were
forty
years
younger
i
should
like
to
go
into
business
again
for
the
association
with
interesting
and
men
was
always
a
great
pleasure
but
i
have
no
dearth
of
interests
to
fill
my
days
and
so
long
as
i
live
i
expect
to
go
on
and
develop
the
plans
which
have
been
my
inspiration
for
a
lifetime
during
all
the
long
period
of
work
which
lasted
from
the
time
i
was
sixteen
years
old
until
i
retired
from
active
business
when
i
was
i
must
admit
that
i
managed
to
get
a
good
many
vacations
of
one
kind
or
another
because
of
the
willingness
of
my
most
efficient
associates
to
assume
the
burdens
of
the
business
which
they
were
so
eminently
qualified
to
conduct
of
detail
work
i
feel
i
have
done
my
full
share
as
i
began
my
business
life
as
a
bookkeeper
i
learned
to
have
great
respect
for
figures
and
facts
no
matter
how
small
they
were
when
there
was
a
matter
of
accounting
to
be
done
in
connection
with
any
plan
with
which
i
was
associated
in
the
earlier
years
i
usually
found
that
i
was
selected
to
undertake
it
i
had
a
passion
for
detail
which
afterward
i
was
forced
to
strive
to
modify
at
pocantico
hills
new
york
where
i
have
spent
portions
of
my
time
for
many
years
in
an
old
house
where
the
fine
views
invite
the
soul
and
where
we
can
live
simply
and
quietly
i
have
spent
many
delightful
hours
studying
the
beautiful
views
the
trees
and
fine
landscape
effects
of
that
very
interesting
section
of
the
hudson
river
and
this
happened
in
the
days
when
i
seemed
to
need
every
minute
for
the
absorbing
demands
of
business
so
i
fear
after
i
got
well
started
i
was
not
what
might
be
called
a
diligent
business
man
this
phrase
diligent
in
business
reminds
me
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
in
cleveland
who
was
devoted
to
his
work
i
talked
to
him
and
no
doubt
bored
him
unspeakably
on
my
special
hobby
which
has
always
been
what
some
people
call
landscape
gardening
but
which
with
me
is
the
art
of
laying
out
roads
and
paths
and
work
of
that
kind
this
friend
of
years
ago
plainly
disapproved
of
a
man
in
business
wasting
his
time
on
what
he
looked
upon
as
mere
foolishness
one
superb
spring
day
i
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
spend
the
afternoon
with
me
a
most
unusual
and
reckless
suggestion
for
a
business
man
to
make
in
those
days
and
see
some
beautiful
paths
through
the
woods
on
my
place
which
i
had
been
planning
and
had
about
completed
i
went
so
far
as
to
tell
him
that
i
would
give
him
a
real
treat
i
can
not
do
it
john
he
said
i
have
an
important
matter
of
business
on
hand
this
afternoon
that
may
all
be
i
urged
but
it
will
give
you
no
such
pleasure
as
you
get
when
you
see
those
paths
the
big
tree
on
each
side
and
go
on
john
with
your
talk
about
trees
and
paths
i
tell
you
got
an
ore
ship
coming
in
and
our
mills
are
waiting
for
her
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
satisfaction
i
not
miss
seeing
her
come
in
for
all
the
wood
paths
in
christendom
he
was
then
getting
to
a
ton
for
bessemer
steel
rails
and
if
his
mill
stopped
a
minute
waiting
for
ore
he
felt
that
he
was
missing
his
life
chance
perhaps
it
was
this
same
man
who
often
gazed
out
into
the
lake
with
every
nerve
stretched
to
try
to
see
an
ore
ship
approaching
one
day
one
of
his
friends
asked
him
if
he
could
see
the
boat
he
reluctantly
admitted
but
she
most
in
sight
this
ore
trade
was
of
great
and
absorbing
interest
at
cleveland
my
old
employer
was
paid
a
ton
for
carrying
ore
from
the
marquette
regions
fifty
years
ago
and
to
think
of
the
wickedness
of
this
maker
of
woodland
paths
who
in
later
years
was
moving
the
ore
in
great
ships
for
eighty
cents
a
ton
and
making
a
fortune
at
it
all
this
reminds
me
of
my
experiences
in
the
ore
business
but
i
shall
come
to
that
later
i
want
to
say
something
about
landscape
gardening
to
which
i
have
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
for
more
than
thirty
years
the
pleasures
of
road
planning
like
my
old
friend
others
may
be
surprised
at
my
claim
to
be
an
amateur
landscape
architect
in
a
small
way
and
my
family
have
been
known
to
employ
a
great
landscape
man
to
make
quite
sure
that
i
did
not
ruin
the
place
the
problem
was
just
where
to
put
the
new
home
at
pocantico
hills
which
has
recently
been
built
i
thought
i
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
every
foot
of
the
land
all
the
old
big
trees
were
personal
friends
of
mine
and
with
the
views
of
any
given
point
i
was
perfectly
familiar
i
had
studied
them
hundreds
of
times
and
after
this
great
landscape
architect
had
laid
out
his
plans
and
had
driven
his
lines
of
stakes
i
asked
if
i
might
see
what
i
could
do
with
the
job
in
a
few
days
i
had
worked
out
a
plan
so
devised
that
the
roads
caught
just
the
best
views
at
just
the
angles
where
in
driving
up
the
hill
you
came
upon
impressive
outlooks
and
at
the
ending
was
the
final
burst
of
river
hill
cloud
and
great
sweep
of
country
to
crown
the
whole
and
here
i
fixed
my
stakes
to
show
where
i
suggested
that
the
roads
should
run
and
finally
the
exact
place
where
the
house
should
be
look
it
all
over
i
said
and
decide
which
plan
is
best
it
was
a
proud
moment
when
this
real
authority
accepted
my
suggestions
as
bringing
out
the
most
favoured
spots
for
views
and
agreed
upon
the
site
of
the
house
how
many
miles
of
roads
i
have
laid
out
in
my
time
i
can
hardly
compute
but
i
have
often
kept
at
it
until
i
was
exhausted
while
surveying
roads
i
have
run
the
lines
until
darkness
made
it
impossible
to
see
the
little
stakes
and
flags
it
is
all
very
vain
of
me
to
tell
of
these
landscape
enterprises
but
perhaps
they
will
offset
the
business
talks
which
occupy
so
much
of
my
story
my
methods
of
attending
to
business
matters
differed
from
those
of
most
merchants
of
my
time
and
allowed
me
more
freedom
even
after
the
chief
affairs
of
the
standard
oil
company
were
moved
to
new
york
i
spent
most
of
my
summers
at
our
home
in
cleveland
and
i
do
still
i
would
come
to
new
york
when
my
presence
seemed
necessary
but
for
the
most
part
i
kept
in
touch
with
the
business
through
our
own
telegraph
wires
and
was
left
free
to
attend
to
many
things
which
interested
me
among
others
the
making
of
paths
the
planting
of
trees
and
the
setting
out
of
little
forests
of
seedlings
of
all
the
profitable
things
which
develop
quickly
under
the
hand
i
have
thought
my
young
nurseries
show
the
greatest
yield
we
keep
a
set
of
account
books
for
each
place
and
i
was
amazed
not
long
ago
at
the
increase
in
value
that
a
few
years
make
in
growing
things
when
we
came
to
remove
some
young
trees
from
westchester
county
to
lakewood
new
jersey
we
plant
our
young
trees
especially
evergreens
by
the
thousand
i
think
we
have
put
in
as
many
as
ten
thousand
at
once
and
let
them
develop
to
be
used
later
in
some
of
our
planting
schemes
if
we
transfer
young
trees
from
pocantico
to
our
home
in
lakewood
we
charge
one
place
and
credit
the
other
for
these
trees
at
the
market
rate
we
are
our
own
best
customers
and
we
make
a
small
fortune
out
of
ourselves
by
selling
to
our
new
jersey
place
at
or
each
trees
which
originally
cost
us
only
five
or
ten
cents
at
pocantico
in
nursery
stock
as
in
other
things
the
advantage
of
doing
things
on
a
large
scale
reveals
itself
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
of
saving
and
moving
large
trees
trees
say
from
ten
to
twenty
inches
in
diameter
or
even
more
in
some
cases
has
been
for
years
a
source
of
great
interest
we
build
our
movers
ourselves
and
work
with
our
own
men
and
it
is
truly
surprising
what
liberties
you
can
take
with
trees
if
you
once
learn
how
to
handle
these
monsters
we
have
moved
trees
ninety
feet
high
and
many
seventy
or
eighty
feet
and
they
naturally
are
by
no
means
young
at
one
time
or
another
we
have
tried
almost
all
kinds
of
trees
including
some
which
the
authorities
said
could
not
be
moved
with
success
perhaps
the
most
daring
experiments
were
with
we
took
up
large
trees
transported
them
considerable
distances
some
of
them
after
they
were
actually
in
flower
all
at
a
cost
of
twenty
dollars
per
tree
and
lost
very
few
we
were
so
successful
that
we
became
rather
reckless
trying
experiments
out
of
season
but
when
we
worked
on
plans
we
had
already
tried
our
results
were
remarkably
satisfactory
taking
our
experiences
in
many
hundreds
of
trees
of
various
kinds
in
and
out
of
season
and
including
the
time
when
we
were
learning
the
art
our
total
loss
has
been
something
less
than
per
probably
more
nearly
or
per
cent
a
whole
campaign
in
a
single
season
has
been
accomplished
with
a
loss
of
about
per
cent
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
in
the
case
of
the
larger
trees
the
growth
has
been
retarded
perhaps
two
years
but
this
is
a
small
matter
for
people
no
longer
young
wish
to
get
the
effects
they
desire
at
once
and
the
modern
does
it
we
have
grouped
and
arranged
clumps
of
big
spruces
to
fit
the
purposes
we
were
aiming
for
and
sometimes
have
completely
covered
a
hillside
with
them
oaks
we
have
not
been
successful
with
except
when
comparatively
young
and
we
do
try
to
move
oaks
and
hickories
when
they
have
come
near
to
maturity
but
we
have
made
some
successful
experiments
with
bass
wood
and
one
of
these
we
have
moved
three
times
without
injury
birches
have
generally
baffled
us
but
evergreens
except
cedars
have
been
almost
invariably
successfully
handled
this
planning
for
good
views
must
have
been
an
early
passion
with
me
i
remember
when
i
was
hardly
more
than
a
boy
i
wanted
to
cut
away
a
big
tree
which
i
thought
interfered
with
the
view
from
the
windows
of
the
of
our
home
i
was
for
cutting
it
down
but
some
other
members
of
the
family
objected
though
my
dear
mother
i
think
sympathized
with
me
as
she
said
one
day
you
know
my
son
we
have
breakfast
at
eight
and
i
think
if
the
tree
were
felled
some
time
before
we
sat
down
to
table
there
would
probably
be
no
great
complaint
when
the
family
saw
the
view
which
the
fallen
tree
revealed
so
it
turned
out
chapter
ii
the
difficult
art
of
getting
to
my
father
i
owe
a
great
debt
in
that
he
himself
trained
me
to
practical
ways
he
was
engaged
in
different
enterprises
he
used
to
tell
me
about
these
things
explaining
their
significance
and
he
taught
me
the
principles
and
methods
of
business
from
early
boyhood
i
kept
a
little
book
which
i
remember
i
called
ledger
a
and
this
little
volume
is
still
preserved
containing
my
receipts
and
expenditures
as
well
as
an
account
of
the
small
sums
that
i
was
taught
to
give
away
regularly
naturally
people
of
modest
means
lead
a
closer
family
life
than
those
who
have
plenty
of
servants
to
do
everything
for
them
i
count
it
a
blessing
that
i
was
of
the
former
class
when
i
was
seven
or
eight
years
old
i
engaged
in
my
first
business
enterprise
with
the
assistance
of
my
mother
i
owned
some
turkeys
and
she
presented
me
with
the
curds
from
the
milk
to
feed
them
i
took
care
of
the
birds
myself
and
sold
them
all
in
fashion
my
receipts
were
all
profit
as
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
expense
account
and
my
records
were
kept
as
carefully
as
i
knew
how
we
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
little
business
affair
and
i
can
still
close
my
eyes
and
distinctly
see
the
gentle
and
dignified
birds
walking
quietly
along
the
brook
and
through
the
woods
cautiously
stealing
the
way
to
their
nests
to
this
day
i
enjoy
the
sight
of
a
flock
of
turkeys
and
never
miss
an
opportunity
of
studying
them
my
mother
was
a
good
deal
of
a
disciplinarian
and
upheld
the
standard
of
the
family
with
a
birch
switch
when
it
showed
a
tendency
to
deteriorate
once
when
i
was
being
punished
for
some
unfortunate
doings
which
had
taken
place
in
the
village
school
i
felt
called
upon
to
explain
after
the
whipping
had
begun
that
i
was
innocent
of
the
charge
never
mind
said
my
mother
we
have
started
in
on
this
whipping
and
it
will
do
for
the
next
time
this
attitude
was
maintained
to
its
final
conclusion
in
many
ways
one
night
i
remember
we
boys
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
go
skating
in
the
moonlight
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
had
been
expressly
forbidden
to
skate
at
night
almost
before
we
got
fairly
started
we
heard
a
cry
for
help
and
found
a
neighbour
who
had
broken
through
the
ice
was
in
danger
of
drowning
by
pushing
a
pole
to
him
we
succeeded
in
fishing
him
out
and
restored
him
safe
and
sound
to
his
grateful
family
as
we
were
not
generally
expected
to
save
a
man
life
every
time
we
skated
my
brother
william
and
i
felt
that
there
were
mitigating
circumstances
connected
with
this
particular
disobedience
which
might
be
taken
into
account
in
the
final
judgment
but
this
idea
proved
to
be
erroneous
starting
at
work
although
the
plan
had
been
to
send
me
to
college
it
seemed
best
at
sixteen
that
i
should
leave
the
high
school
in
which
i
had
nearly
completed
the
course
and
go
into
a
commercial
college
in
cleveland
for
a
few
months
they
taught
bookkeeping
and
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
commercial
transactions
this
training
though
it
lasted
only
a
few
months
was
very
valuable
to
me
but
how
to
get
a
job
that
was
the
question
i
tramped
the
streets
for
days
and
weeks
asking
merchants
and
storekeepers
if
they
did
want
a
boy
but
the
offer
of
my
services
met
with
little
appreciation
no
one
wanted
a
boy
and
very
few
showed
any
overwhelming
anxiety
to
talk
with
me
on
the
subject
at
last
one
man
on
the
cleveland
docks
told
me
that
i
might
come
back
after
the
noonday
meal
i
was
elated
it
now
seemed
that
i
might
get
a
start
i
was
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
lest
i
should
lose
this
one
opportunity
that
i
had
unearthed
when
finally
at
what
seemed
to
me
the
time
i
presented
myself
to
my
employer
we
will
give
you
a
chance
he
said
but
not
a
word
passed
between
us
about
pay
this
was
september
i
joyfully
went
to
work
the
name
of
the
firm
was
hewitt
tuttle
in
beginning
the
work
i
had
some
advantages
my
father
training
as
i
have
said
was
practical
the
course
at
the
commercial
college
had
taught
me
the
rudiments
of
business
and
i
thus
had
a
groundwork
to
build
upon
i
was
fortunate
also
in
working
under
the
supervision
of
the
bookkeeper
who
was
a
fine
disciplinarian
and
well
disposed
toward
me
when
january
arrived
tuttle
presented
me
with
for
my
three
months
work
which
was
no
doubt
all
that
i
was
worth
and
it
was
entirely
satisfactory
for
the
next
year
with
a
month
i
kept
my
position
learning
the
details
and
clerical
work
connected
with
such
a
business
it
was
a
wholesale
produce
commission
and
forwarding
concern
my
department
being
particularly
the
office
duties
just
above
me
was
the
bookkeeper
for
the
house
and
he
received
a
year
salary
in
lieu
of
his
share
of
the
profits
of
the
firm
of
which
he
was
a
member
at
the
end
of
the
first
fiscal
year
when
he
left
i
assumed
his
clerical
and
bookkeeping
work
for
which
i
received
the
salary
of
as
i
look
back
upon
this
term
of
business
apprenticeship
i
can
see
that
its
influence
was
vitally
important
in
its
relations
to
what
came
after
to
begin
with
my
work
was
done
in
the
office
of
the
firm
itself
i
was
almost
always
present
when
they
talked
of
their
affairs
laid
out
their
plans
and
decided
upon
a
course
of
action
i
thus
had
an
advantage
over
other
boys
of
my
age
who
were
quicker
and
who
could
figure
and
write
better
than
i
the
firm
conducted
a
business
with
so
many
ramifications
that
this
education
was
quite
extensive
they
owned
warehouses
and
buildings
which
were
rented
for
offices
and
a
variety
of
uses
and
i
had
to
collect
the
rents
they
shipped
by
rail
canal
and
lake
there
were
many
different
kinds
of
negotiations
and
transactions
going
on
and
with
all
these
i
was
in
close
touch
thus
it
happened
that
my
duties
were
vastly
more
interesting
than
those
of
an
in
a
large
house
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
work
gradually
the
auditing
of
accounts
was
left
in
my
hands
all
the
bills
were
first
passed
upon
by
me
and
i
took
this
duty
very
seriously
one
day
i
remember
i
was
in
a
neighbour
office
when
the
local
plumber
presented
himself
with
a
bill
about
a
yard
long
this
neighbour
was
one
of
those
very
busy
men
he
was
connected
with
what
seemed
to
me
an
unlimited
number
of
enterprises
he
merely
glanced
at
this
tiresome
bill
turned
to
the
bookkeeper
and
said
please
pay
this
bill
as
i
was
studying
the
same
plumber
bills
in
great
detail
checking
every
item
if
only
for
a
few
cents
and
finding
it
to
be
greatly
to
the
firm
interest
to
do
so
this
casual
way
of
conducting
affairs
did
not
appeal
to
me
i
had
trained
myself
to
the
point
of
view
doubtless
held
by
many
young
men
in
business
that
my
check
on
a
bill
was
the
executive
act
which
released
my
employer
money
from
the
till
and
was
attended
with
more
responsibility
than
the
spending
of
my
own
funds
i
made
up
my
mind
that
such
business
methods
could
not
succeed
passing
bills
collecting
rents
adjusting
claims
and
work
of
this
kind
brought
me
in
association
with
a
great
variety
of
people
i
had
to
learn
how
to
get
on
with
all
these
different
classes
and
still
keep
the
relations
between
them
and
the
house
pleasant
one
particular
kind
of
negotiation
came
to
me
which
took
all
the
skill
i
could
master
to
bring
to
a
successful
end
we
would
receive
for
example
a
shipment
of
marble
from
vermont
to
cleveland
this
involved
handling
by
railroad
canal
and
lake
boats
the
cost
of
losses
or
damage
had
to
be
somehow
fixed
between
these
three
different
carriers
and
it
taxed
all
the
ingenuity
of
a
boy
of
seventeen
to
work
out
this
problem
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
including
my
employers
but
i
thought
the
task
no
hardship
and
so
far
as
i
can
remember
i
never
had
any
disagreement
of
moment
with
any
of
these
transportation
interests
this
experience
in
conducting
all
sorts
of
transactions
at
such
an
impressionable
age
with
the
helping
hand
of
my
superiors
to
fall
back
upon
in
an
emergency
was
highly
interesting
to
me
it
was
my
first
step
in
learning
the
principle
of
negotiation
of
which
i
hope
to
speak
later
the
training
that
comes
from
working
for
some
one
else
to
whom
we
feel
a
responsibility
i
am
sure
was
of
great
value
to
me
i
should
estimate
that
the
salaries
of
that
time
were
far
less
than
half
of
what
is
paid
for
equivalent
positions
the
next
year
i
was
offered
a
salary
of
but
thought
i
was
worth
we
had
not
settled
the
matter
by
april
and
as
a
favourable
opportunity
had
presented
itself
for
carrying
on
the
same
business
on
my
own
account
i
resigned
my
position
in
those
days
in
cleveland
everyone
knew
almost
everyone
else
in
town
among
the
merchants
was
a
young
englishman
named
clark
perhaps
ten
years
older
than
i
who
wanted
to
establish
a
business
and
was
in
search
of
a
partner
he
had
to
contribute
to
the
firm
and
wanted
a
partner
who
could
furnish
an
equal
amount
this
seemed
a
good
opportunity
for
me
i
had
saved
up
or
but
where
to
get
the
rest
was
a
problem
i
talked
the
matter
over
with
my
father
who
told
me
that
he
had
always
intended
to
give
to
each
of
his
children
when
they
reached
he
said
that
if
i
wished
to
receive
my
share
at
once
instead
of
waiting
he
would
advance
it
to
me
and
i
could
pay
interest
upon
the
sum
until
i
was
but
john
he
added
the
rate
is
ten
at
that
time
per
cent
a
year
interest
was
a
very
common
rate
for
such
loans
at
the
banks
the
rate
might
not
have
been
quite
so
high
but
of
course
the
financial
institutions
could
not
supply
all
the
demands
so
there
was
much
private
borrowing
at
high
figures
as
i
needed
this
money
for
the
partnership
i
gladly
accepted
my
offer
and
so
began
business
as
the
junior
partner
of
the
new
firm
which
was
called
clark
rockefeller
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
my
own
employer
mentally
i
swelled
with
pride
a
partner
in
a
firm
with
capital
clark
attended
to
the
buying
and
selling
and
i
took
charge
of
the
finance
and
the
books
we
at
once
began
to
do
a
large
business
dealing
in
carload
lots
and
cargoes
of
produce
naturally
we
soon
needed
more
money
to
take
care
of
the
increasing
trade
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
attempt
to
borrow
from
a
bank
but
would
the
bank
lend
to
us
the
first
loan
i
went
to
a
bank
president
whom
i
knew
and
who
knew
me
i
remember
perfectly
how
anxious
i
was
to
get
that
loan
and
to
establish
myself
favourably
with
the
banker
this
gentleman
was
handy
a
sweet
and
gentle
old
man
well
known
as
a
beautiful
character
for
fifty
years
he
was
interested
in
young
men
he
knew
me
as
a
boy
in
the
cleveland
schools
i
gave
him
all
the
particulars
of
our
business
telling
him
frankly
about
our
affairs
what
we
wanted
to
use
the
money
for
etc
i
waited
for
the
verdict
with
almost
trembling
eagerness
how
much
do
you
want
he
said
two
thousand
dollars
all
right
rockefeller
you
can
have
it
he
replied
just
give
me
your
own
warehouse
receipts
they
good
enough
for
me
as
i
left
that
bank
my
elation
can
hardly
be
imagined
i
held
up
my
head
think
of
it
a
bank
had
trusted
me
for
i
felt
that
i
was
now
a
man
of
importance
in
the
community
for
long
years
after
the
head
of
this
bank
was
a
friend
indeed
he
loaned
me
money
when
i
needed
it
and
i
needed
it
almost
all
the
time
and
all
the
money
he
had
it
was
a
source
of
gratification
that
later
i
was
able
to
go
to
him
and
recommend
that
he
should
make
a
certain
investment
in
standard
oil
stock
he
agreed
that
he
would
like
to
do
so
but
he
said
that
the
sum
involved
was
not
at
the
moment
available
and
so
at
my
suggestion
i
turned
banker
for
him
and
in
the
end
he
took
out
his
principal
with
a
very
handsome
profit
it
is
a
pleasure
to
testify
even
at
this
late
date
to
his
great
kindness
and
faith
in
me
sticking
to
business
principles
mr
handy
trusted
me
because
he
believed
we
would
conduct
our
young
business
on
conservative
and
proper
lines
and
i
well
remember
about
this
time
an
example
of
how
hard
it
is
sometimes
to
live
up
to
what
one
knows
is
the
right
business
principle
not
long
after
our
concern
was
started
our
best
customer
that
is
the
man
who
made
the
largest
consignments
asked
that
we
should
allow
him
to
draw
in
advance
on
current
shipments
before
the
produce
or
a
bill
of
lading
were
actually
in
hand
we
of
course
wished
to
oblige
this
important
man
but
i
as
the
financial
member
of
the
firm
objected
though
i
feared
we
should
lose
his
business
the
situation
seemed
very
serious
my
partner
was
impatient
with
me
for
refusing
to
yield
and
in
this
dilemma
i
decided
to
go
personally
to
see
if
i
could
not
induce
our
customer
to
relent
i
had
been
unusually
fortunate
when
i
came
face
to
face
with
men
in
winning
their
friendship
and
my
partner
displeasure
put
me
on
my
mettle
i
felt
that
when
i
got
into
touch
with
this
gentleman
i
could
convince
him
that
what
he
proposed
would
result
in
a
bad
precedent
my
reasoning
in
my
own
mind
was
logical
and
convincing
i
went
to
see
him
and
put
forth
all
the
arguments
that
i
had
so
carefully
thought
out
but
he
stormed
about
and
in
the
end
i
had
the
further
humiliation
of
confessing
to
my
partner
that
i
had
failed
i
had
been
able
to
accomplish
absolutely
nothing
naturally
he
was
very
much
disturbed
at
the
possibility
of
losing
our
most
valued
connection
but
i
insisted
and
we
stuck
to
our
principles
and
refused
to
give
the
shipper
the
accommodation
he
had
asked
what
was
our
surprise
and
gratification
to
find
that
he
continued
his
relations
with
us
as
though
nothing
had
happened
and
did
not
again
refer
to
the
matter
i
learned
afterward
that
an
old
country
banker
named
john
gardener
of
norwalk
who
had
much
to
do
with
our
consignor
was
watching
this
little
matter
intently
and
i
have
ever
since
believed
that
he
originated
the
suggestion
to
tempt
us
to
do
what
we
stated
we
did
not
do
as
a
test
and
his
story
about
our
firm
stand
for
what
we
regarded
as
sound
business
principles
did
us
great
good
about
this
time
i
began
to
go
out
and
solicit
business
a
branch
of
work
i
had
never
before
attempted
i
undertook
to
visit
every
person
in
our
part
of
the
country
who
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
kind
of
business
that
we
were
engaged
in
and
went
pretty
well
over
the
states
of
ohio
and
indiana
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
do
this
best
by
simply
introducing
our
firm
and
not
pressing
for
immediate
consignments
i
told
them
that
i
represented
clark
rockefeller
commission
merchants
and
that
i
had
no
wish
to
interfere
with
any
connection
that
they
had
at
present
but
if
the
opportunity
offered
we
should
be
glad
to
serve
them
etc
to
our
great
surprise
business
came
in
upon
us
so
fast
that
we
hardly
knew
how
to
take
care
of
it
and
in
the
first
year
our
sales
amounted
to
half
a
million
dollars
then
and
indeed
for
many
years
after
it
seemed
as
though
there
was
no
end
to
the
money
needed
to
carry
on
and
develop
the
business
as
our
successes
began
to
come
i
seldom
put
my
head
upon
the
pillow
at
night
without
speaking
a
few
words
to
myself
in
this
wise
now
a
little
success
soon
you
will
fall
down
soon
you
will
be
overthrown
because
you
have
got
a
start
you
think
you
are
quite
a
merchant
look
out
or
you
will
lose
your
head
go
steady
these
intimate
conversations
with
myself
i
am
sure
had
a
great
influence
on
my
life
i
was
afraid
i
could
not
stand
my
prosperity
and
tried
to
teach
myself
not
to
get
puffed
up
with
any
foolish
notions
my
loans
from
my
father
were
many
our
relations
on
finances
were
a
source
of
some
anxiety
to
me
and
were
not
quite
so
humorous
as
they
seem
now
as
i
look
back
at
them
occasionally
he
would
come
to
me
and
say
that
if
i
needed
money
in
the
business
he
would
be
able
to
loan
some
and
as
i
always
needed
capital
i
was
glad
indeed
to
get
it
even
at
per
cent
interest
just
at
the
moment
when
i
required
the
money
most
he
was
apt
to
say
my
son
i
find
i
have
got
to
have
that
money
of
course
you
shall
have
it
at
once
i
would
answer
but
i
knew
that
he
was
testing
me
and
that
when
i
paid
him
he
would
hold
the
money
without
its
earning
anything
for
a
little
time
and
then
offer
it
back
later
i
confess
that
this
little
discipline
should
have
done
me
good
and
perhaps
did
but
while
i
concealed
it
from
him
the
truth
is
i
was
not
particularly
pleased
with
his
application
of
tests
to
discover
if
my
financial
ability
was
equal
to
such
shocks
interest
at
per
cent
these
experiences
with
my
father
remind
me
that
in
the
early
days
there
was
often
much
discussion
as
to
what
should
be
paid
for
the
use
of
money
many
people
protested
that
the
rate
of
per
cent
was
outrageous
and
none
but
a
wicked
man
would
exact
such
a
charge
i
was
accustomed
to
argue
that
money
was
worth
what
it
would
bring
no
one
would
pay
per
or
per
or
per
cent
unless
the
borrower
believed
that
at
this
rate
it
was
profitable
to
employ
it
as
i
was
always
the
borrower
at
that
time
i
certainly
did
not
argue
for
paying
more
than
was
necessary
among
the
most
persistent
and
heated
discussions
i
ever
had
were
those
with
the
dear
old
lady
who
kept
the
where
my
brother
william
and
i
lived
when
we
were
away
from
home
at
school
i
used
to
greatly
enjoy
these
talks
for
she
was
an
able
woman
and
a
good
talker
and
as
she
charged
us
only
a
dollar
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
and
fed
us
well
i
certainly
was
her
friend
this
was
about
the
usual
price
for
board
in
the
small
towns
in
those
days
where
the
produce
was
raised
almost
entirely
on
the
place
this
estimable
lady
was
violently
opposed
to
loaners
obtaining
high
rates
of
interest
and
we
had
frequent
and
earnest
arguments
on
the
subject
she
knew
that
i
was
accustomed
to
make
loans
for
my
father
and
she
was
familiar
with
the
rates
secured
but
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
did
not
change
the
rate
and
it
came
down
only
when
the
supply
of
money
grew
more
plentiful
i
have
usually
found
that
important
alterations
in
public
opinion
in
regard
to
business
matters
have
been
of
slow
growth
along
the
line
of
proved
economic
theory
very
rarely
have
improvements
in
these
relationships
come
about
through
hastily
devised
legislation
one
can
hardly
realize
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
capital
for
active
business
enterprises
at
that
time
in
the
country
farther
west
much
higher
rates
were
paid
which
applied
usually
to
personal
loans
on
which
a
business
risk
was
run
but
it
shows
how
different
the
conditions
for
young
business
men
were
then
than
now
a
nimble
borrower
speaking
of
borrowing
at
the
banks
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
most
strenuous
financial
efforts
i
ever
made
we
had
to
raise
the
money
to
accept
an
offer
for
a
large
business
it
required
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
in
cash
securities
would
not
answer
i
received
the
message
at
about
noon
and
had
to
get
off
on
the
train
i
drove
from
bank
to
bank
asking
each
president
or
cashier
whomever
i
could
find
first
to
get
ready
for
me
all
the
funds
he
could
possibly
lay
hands
on
i
told
them
i
would
be
back
to
get
the
money
later
i
rounded
up
all
of
our
banks
in
the
city
and
made
a
second
journey
to
get
the
money
and
kept
going
until
i
secured
the
necessary
amount
with
this
i
was
off
on
the
train
and
closed
the
transaction
in
these
early
days
i
was
a
good
deal
of
a
traveller
visiting
our
plants
making
new
connections
seeing
people
arranging
plans
to
extend
our
business
and
it
often
called
for
very
rapid
work
raising
church
funds
when
i
was
but
seventeen
or
eighteen
i
was
elected
as
a
trustee
in
the
church
it
was
a
mission
branch
and
occasionally
i
had
to
hear
members
who
belonged
to
the
main
body
speak
of
the
mission
as
though
it
were
not
quite
so
good
as
the
big
mother
church
this
strengthened
our
resolve
to
show
them
that
we
could
paddle
our
own
canoe
our
first
church
was
not
a
very
grand
affair
and
there
was
a
mortgage
of
on
it
which
had
been
a
dispiriting
influence
for
years
the
holder
of
the
mortgage
had
long
demanded
that
he
should
be
paid
but
somehow
even
the
interest
was
barely
kept
up
and
the
creditor
finally
threatened
to
sell
us
out
as
it
happened
the
money
had
been
lent
by
a
deacon
in
the
church
but
notwithstanding
this
fact
he
felt
that
he
should
have
his
money
and
perhaps
he
really
needed
it
anyhow
he
proposed
to
take
such
steps
as
were
necessary
to
get
it
the
matter
came
to
a
head
one
sunday
morning
when
the
minister
announced
from
the
pulpit
that
the
would
have
to
be
raised
or
we
should
lose
our
church
building
i
therefore
found
myself
at
the
door
of
the
church
as
the
congregation
came
and
went
as
each
member
came
by
i
buttonholed
him
and
got
him
to
promise
to
give
something
toward
the
extinguishing
of
that
debt
i
pleaded
and
urged
and
almost
threatened
as
each
one
promised
i
put
his
name
and
the
amount
down
in
my
little
book
and
continued
to
solicit
from
every
possible
subscriber
this
campaign
for
raising
the
money
which
started
that
morning
after
church
lasted
for
several
months
it
was
a
great
undertaking
to
raise
such
a
sum
of
money
in
small
amounts
ranging
from
a
few
cents
to
the
more
magnificent
promises
of
gifts
to
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
or
fifty
cents
per
week
the
plan
absorbed
me
i
contributed
what
i
could
and
my
first
ambition
to
earn
more
money
was
aroused
by
this
and
similar
undertakings
in
which
i
was
constantly
engaged
but
at
last
the
was
all
in
hand
and
a
proud
day
it
was
when
the
debt
was
extinguished
i
hope
the
members
of
the
mother
church
were
properly
humiliated
to
see
how
far
we
had
gone
beyond
their
expectations
but
i
do
not
now
recall
that
they
expressed
the
surprise
that
we
flattered
ourselves
they
must
have
felt
the
begging
experiences
i
had
at
that
time
were
full
of
interest
i
went
at
the
task
with
pride
rather
than
the
reverse
and
i
continued
it
until
my
increasing
cares
and
responsibilities
compelled
me
to
resign
the
actual
working
out
of
details
to
others
chapter
iii
the
standard
oil
company
it
would
be
surprising
if
in
an
organization
which
included
a
great
number
of
men
there
should
not
be
an
occasional
employee
here
and
there
who
acted
in
connection
with
the
business
or
perhaps
in
conducting
his
own
affairs
in
a
way
which
might
be
criticized
even
in
a
comparatively
small
organization
it
is
wellnigh
impossible
to
restrain
this
occasional
man
who
is
for
his
own
or
his
company
advancement
to
judge
the
character
of
all
the
members
of
a
great
organization
or
the
organization
itself
by
the
actions
of
a
few
individuals
would
be
manifestly
unfair
it
has
been
said
that
i
forced
the
men
who
became
my
partners
in
the
oil
business
to
join
with
me
i
would
not
have
been
so
if
it
were
true
that
i
followed
such
tactics
i
ask
would
it
have
been
possible
to
make
of
such
men
companions
would
they
accept
and
remain
for
many
years
in
positions
of
the
greatest
trust
and
finally
could
any
one
have
formed
of
such
men
if
they
had
been
so
browbeaten
a
group
which
has
for
all
these
years
worked
in
loyal
harmony
with
fair
dealing
among
themselves
as
well
as
with
others
building
up
efficiency
and
acting
in
entire
unity
this
powerful
organization
has
not
only
lasted
but
its
efficiency
has
increased
for
fourteen
years
i
have
been
out
of
business
and
in
eight
or
ten
years
went
only
once
to
the
company
office
in
the
summer
of
i
visited
again
the
room
at
the
top
of
the
standard
oil
company
building
where
the
officers
of
the
company
and
the
heads
of
departments
have
had
their
luncheon
served
for
many
years
i
was
surprised
to
find
so
many
men
who
had
come
to
the
front
since
my
last
visit
years
ago
afterward
i
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
old
associates
and
many
new
ones
and
it
was
a
source
of
great
gratification
to
me
to
find
that
the
same
spirit
of
coöperation
and
harmony
existed
unchanged
this
practice
of
lunching
together
a
hundred
or
more
at
long
tables
in
most
intimate
and
friendly
association
is
another
indication
of
what
i
contend
slight
as
it
may
seem
to
be
at
first
thought
would
these
people
seek
each
companionship
day
after
day
if
they
had
been
forced
into
this
relation
people
in
such
a
position
do
not
go
on
for
long
in
a
pleasant
and
congenial
intimacy
for
years
the
standard
oil
company
has
developed
step
by
step
and
i
am
convinced
that
it
has
done
well
its
work
of
supplying
to
the
people
the
products
from
petroleum
at
prices
which
have
decreased
as
the
efficiency
of
the
business
has
been
built
up
it
gradually
extended
its
services
first
to
the
large
centres
and
then
to
towns
and
now
to
the
smallest
places
going
to
the
homes
of
its
customers
delivering
the
oil
to
suit
the
convenience
of
the
actual
users
this
same
system
is
being
followed
out
in
various
parts
of
the
world
the
company
has
for
example
three
thousand
tank
wagons
supplying
american
oil
to
towns
and
even
small
hamlets
in
europe
its
own
depots
and
employees
deliver
it
in
a
somewhat
similar
way
in
japan
china
india
and
the
chief
countries
of
the
world
do
you
think
this
trade
has
been
developed
by
anything
but
hard
work
this
plan
of
selling
our
products
direct
to
the
consumer
and
the
exceptionally
rapid
growth
of
the
business
bred
a
certain
antagonism
which
i
suppose
could
not
have
been
avoided
but
this
same
idea
of
dealing
with
the
consumer
directly
has
been
followed
by
others
and
in
many
lines
of
trade
without
creating
so
far
as
i
recall
any
serious
opposition
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
important
point
and
i
have
often
wondered
if
the
criticism
which
centred
upon
us
did
not
come
from
the
fact
that
we
were
among
the
first
if
not
the
first
to
work
out
the
problems
of
direct
selling
to
the
user
on
a
broad
scale
this
was
done
in
a
fair
spirit
and
with
due
consideration
for
everyone
rights
we
did
not
ruthlessly
go
after
the
trade
of
our
competitors
and
attempt
to
ruin
it
by
cutting
prices
or
instituting
a
spy
system
we
had
set
ourselves
the
task
of
building
up
as
rapidly
and
as
broadly
as
possible
the
volume
of
consumption
let
me
try
to
explain
just
what
happened
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
facilities
we
had
in
manufacture
we
sought
the
utmost
market
in
all
lands
we
needed
volume
to
do
this
we
had
to
create
selling
methods
far
in
advance
of
what
then
existed
we
had
to
dispose
of
two
or
three
or
four
gallons
of
oil
where
one
had
been
sold
before
and
we
could
not
rely
upon
the
usual
trade
channels
then
existing
to
accomplish
this
it
was
never
our
purpose
to
interfere
with
a
dealer
who
adequately
cultivated
his
field
of
operations
but
when
we
saw
a
new
opportunity
or
a
new
place
for
extending
the
sale
by
further
and
effective
facilities
we
made
it
our
business
to
provide
them
in
this
way
we
opened
many
new
lines
in
which
others
have
shared
in
this
development
we
had
to
employ
many
comparatively
new
men
the
ideal
way
to
supply
material
for
higher
positions
is
of
course
to
recruit
the
men
from
among
the
youngest
in
the
company
service
but
our
expansion
was
too
rapid
to
permit
this
in
all
cases
that
some
of
these
employees
were
in
going
after
sales
it
would
not
be
surprising
to
learn
but
they
were
acting
in
violation
of
the
expressed
and
known
wishes
of
the
company
but
even
these
instances
i
am
convinced
occurred
so
seldom
by
comparison
with
the
number
of
transactions
we
carried
on
that
they
were
really
the
exceptions
that
proved
the
rule
every
week
in
the
year
for
many
many
years
this
concern
has
brought
into
this
country
more
than
a
million
dollars
gold
all
from
the
products
produced
by
american
labour
i
am
proud
of
the
record
and
believe
most
americans
will
be
when
they
understand
some
things
better
these
achievements
the
development
of
this
great
foreign
trade
the
owning
of
ships
to
carry
the
oil
in
bulk
by
the
most
economical
methods
the
sending
out
of
men
to
fight
for
the
markets
have
cost
huge
sums
of
money
and
the
vast
capital
employed
could
not
be
raised
nor
controlled
except
by
such
an
organization
as
the
standard
is
to
give
a
true
picture
of
the
early
conditions
one
must
realize
that
the
oil
industry
was
considered
a
most
hazardous
undertaking
not
altogether
unlike
the
speculative
mining
undertakings
we
hear
so
much
of
i
well
remember
my
old
and
distinguished
friend
rev
thomas
armitage
for
some
forty
years
pastor
of
a
great
new
york
church
warning
me
that
it
was
worse
than
folly
to
extend
our
plants
and
our
operations
he
was
sure
we
were
running
unwarranted
risks
that
our
oil
supply
would
probably
fail
the
demand
would
decline
and
he
with
many
others
sometimes
i
thought
almost
everybody
prophesied
ruin
none
of
us
ever
dreamed
of
the
magnitude
of
what
proved
to
be
the
later
expansion
we
did
our
day
work
as
we
met
it
looking
forward
to
what
we
could
see
in
the
distance
and
keeping
well
up
to
our
opportunities
but
laying
our
foundations
firmly
as
i
have
said
capital
was
most
difficult
to
secure
and
it
was
not
easy
to
interest
conservative
men
in
this
adventurous
business
men
of
property
were
afraid
of
it
though
in
rare
cases
capitalists
were
induced
to
unite
with
us
to
a
limited
extent
if
they
bought
our
stock
at
all
they
took
a
little
of
it
now
and
then
as
an
experiment
and
we
were
painfully
conscious
that
they
often
declined
to
buy
new
stock
with
many
beautiful
expressions
of
appreciation
the
enterprise
being
so
new
and
novel
on
account
of
the
fearfulness
of
certain
holders
in
reference
to
its
success
we
frequently
had
to
take
stock
to
keep
it
from
going
begging
but
we
had
such
confidence
in
the
fundamental
value
of
the
concern
that
we
were
willing
to
assume
this
risk
there
are
always
a
few
men
in
an
undertaking
of
this
kind
who
would
risk
all
on
their
judgment
of
the
final
result
and
if
the
enterprise
had
failed
these
would
have
been
classed
as
visionary
adventurers
and
perhaps
with
good
reason
the
men
who
are
at
work
constantly
in
the
service
of
the
company
are
kept
busy
year
in
and
year
out
the
past
year
has
been
a
time
of
great
contraction
but
the
standard
has
gone
on
with
its
plans
unchecked
and
the
new
works
and
buildings
have
not
been
delayed
on
account
of
lack
of
capital
or
fear
of
bad
times
it
pays
its
workmen
well
it
cares
for
them
when
sick
and
pensions
them
when
old
it
has
never
had
any
important
strikes
and
if
there
is
any
better
function
of
business
management
than
giving
profitable
work
to
employees
year
after
year
in
good
times
and
bad
i
do
know
what
it
is
another
thing
to
be
remembered
about
this
octopus
is
that
there
has
been
no
water
introduced
into
its
capital
perhaps
we
felt
that
oil
and
water
would
not
have
mixed
nor
in
all
these
years
has
any
one
had
to
wait
for
money
which
the
standard
owed
it
has
suffered
from
great
fires
and
losses
but
it
has
taken
care
of
its
affairs
in
such
a
way
that
it
has
not
found
it
necessary
to
appeal
to
the
general
public
to
place
blocks
of
bonds
or
stock
it
has
used
no
underwriting
syndicates
or
schemes
in
any
form
and
it
has
always
managed
to
finance
new
oil
field
operations
when
called
upon
it
is
a
common
thing
to
hear
people
say
that
this
company
has
crushed
out
its
competitors
only
the
uninformed
could
make
such
an
assertion
it
has
and
always
has
had
and
always
will
have
hundreds
of
active
competitors
it
has
lived
only
because
it
has
managed
its
affairs
well
and
economically
and
with
great
vigour
to
speak
of
competition
for
a
minute
consider
not
only
the
able
people
who
compete
in
refining
oil
but
all
the
competition
in
the
various
trades
which
make
and
sell
a
great
variety
of
different
businesses
and
perhaps
of
even
more
importance
is
the
competition
in
foreign
lands
the
standard
is
always
fighting
to
sell
the
american
product
against
the
oil
produced
from
the
great
fields
of
russia
which
struggles
for
the
trade
of
europe
and
the
burma
oil
which
largely
affects
the
market
in
india
in
all
these
various
countries
we
are
met
with
tariffs
which
are
raised
against
us
local
prejudices
and
strange
customs
in
many
countries
we
had
to
teach
the
people
the
chinese
for
example
to
burn
oil
by
making
lamps
for
them
we
packed
the
oil
to
be
carried
by
camels
or
on
the
backs
of
runners
in
the
most
remote
portions
of
the
world
we
adapted
the
trade
to
the
needs
of
strange
folk
every
time
we
succeeded
in
a
foreign
land
it
meant
dollars
brought
to
this
country
and
every
time
we
failed
it
was
a
loss
to
our
nation
and
its
workmen
one
of
our
greatest
helpers
has
been
the
state
department
in
washington
our
ambassadors
and
ministers
and
consuls
have
aided
to
push
our
way
into
new
markets
to
the
utmost
corners
of
the
world
i
think
i
can
speak
thus
frankly
and
enthusiastically
because
the
working
out
of
many
of
these
great
plans
has
developed
largely
since
i
retired
from
the
business
fourteen
years
ago
the
standard
has
not
now
and
never
did
have
a
royal
road
to
supremacy
nor
is
its
success
due
to
any
one
man
but
to
the
multitude
of
able
men
who
are
working
together
if
the
present
managers
of
the
company
were
to
relax
efforts
allow
the
quality
of
their
product
to
degenerate
or
treat
their
customers
badly
how
long
would
their
business
last
about
as
long
as
any
other
neglected
business
to
read
some
of
the
accounts
of
the
affairs
of
the
company
one
would
think
that
it
had
such
a
hold
on
the
oil
trade
that
the
directors
did
little
but
come
together
and
declare
dividends
it
is
a
pleasure
for
me
to
take
this
opportunity
to
pay
tribute
to
the
work
these
men
are
doing
not
only
for
the
company
they
serve
but
for
the
foreign
trade
of
our
country
for
more
than
half
of
all
the
product
that
the
company
makes
is
sold
outside
of
the
united
states
if
in
place
of
these
directors
the
business
were
taken
over
and
run
by
anyone
but
experts
i
would
sell
my
interest
for
any
price
i
could
get
to
succeed
in
a
business
requires
the
best
and
most
earnest
men
to
manage
it
and
the
best
men
rise
to
the
top
of
its
origin
and
early
plans
i
will
speak
later
the
modern
corporation
beyond
question
there
is
a
suspicion
of
corporations
there
may
be
reason
for
such
suspicion
very
often
for
a
corporation
may
be
moral
or
immoral
just
as
a
man
may
be
moral
or
the
reverse
but
it
is
folly
to
condemn
all
corporations
because
some
are
bad
or
even
to
be
unduly
suspicious
of
all
because
some
are
bad
but
the
corporation
in
form
and
character
has
come
to
stay
that
is
a
thing
that
may
be
depended
upon
even
small
firms
are
becoming
corporations
because
it
is
a
convenient
form
of
partnership
it
is
equally
true
that
combinations
of
capital
are
bound
to
continue
and
to
grow
and
this
need
not
alarm
even
the
most
timid
if
the
corporation
or
the
series
of
corporations
is
properly
conducted
with
due
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
the
day
of
individual
competition
in
large
affairs
is
past
and
gone
you
might
just
as
well
argue
that
we
should
go
back
to
hand
labour
and
throw
away
our
efficient
machines
and
the
sober
good
sense
of
the
people
will
accept
this
fact
when
they
have
studied
and
tried
it
out
just
see
how
the
list
of
stockholders
in
the
great
corporations
is
increasing
by
leaps
and
bounds
this
means
that
all
these
people
are
becoming
partners
in
great
businesses
it
is
a
good
thing
it
will
bring
a
feeling
of
increased
responsibility
to
the
managers
of
the
corporations
and
will
make
the
people
who
have
their
interests
involved
study
the
facts
impartially
before
condemning
or
attacking
them
on
this
subject
of
industrial
combinations
i
have
often
expressed
my
opinions
and
as
i
have
not
changed
my
mind
i
am
not
averse
to
repeating
them
now
especially
as
the
subject
seems
again
to
be
so
much
in
the
public
eye
the
chief
advantages
from
industrial
combinations
are
those
which
can
be
derived
from
a
coöperation
of
persons
and
aggregation
of
capital
much
that
one
man
can
not
do
alone
two
can
do
together
and
once
admit
the
fact
that
coöperation
or
what
is
the
same
thing
combination
is
necessary
on
a
small
scale
the
limit
depends
solely
upon
the
necessities
of
business
two
persons
in
partnership
may
be
a
sufficiently
large
combination
for
a
small
business
but
if
the
business
grows
or
can
be
made
to
grow
more
persons
and
more
capital
must
be
taken
in
the
business
may
grow
so
large
that
a
partnership
ceases
to
be
a
proper
instrumentality
for
its
purposes
and
then
a
corporation
becomes
a
necessity
in
most
countries
as
in
england
this
form
of
industrial
combination
is
sufficient
for
a
business
with
the
parent
country
but
it
is
not
so
in
america
our
federal
form
of
government
making
every
corporation
created
by
a
state
foreign
to
every
other
state
renders
it
necessary
for
persons
doing
business
through
corporate
agency
to
organize
corporations
in
some
or
many
of
the
different
states
in
which
their
business
is
located
instead
of
doing
business
through
the
agency
of
one
corporation
they
must
do
business
through
the
agencies
of
several
corporations
if
the
business
is
extended
to
foreign
countries
and
americans
are
not
satisfied
with
home
markets
alone
it
will
be
found
helpful
and
possibly
necessary
to
organize
corporations
in
such
countries
for
europeans
are
prejudiced
against
foreign
corporations
as
are
the
people
of
many
of
our
states
these
different
corporations
thus
become
coöperating
agencies
in
the
same
business
and
are
held
together
by
common
ownership
of
their
stocks
it
is
too
late
to
argue
about
advantages
of
industrial
combinations
they
are
a
necessity
and
if
americans
are
to
have
the
privilege
of
extending
their
business
in
all
the
states
of
the
union
and
into
foreign
countries
as
well
they
are
a
necessity
on
a
large
scale
and
require
the
agency
of
more
than
one
corporation
the
dangers
are
that
the
power
conferred
by
combination
may
be
abused
that
combinations
may
be
formed
for
speculation
in
stocks
rather
than
for
conducting
business
and
that
for
this
purpose
prices
may
be
temporarily
raised
instead
of
being
lowered
these
abuses
are
possible
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
all
combinations
large
or
small
but
this
fact
is
no
more
of
an
argument
against
combinations
than
the
fact
that
steam
may
explode
is
an
argument
against
steam
steam
is
necessary
and
can
be
made
comparatively
safe
combination
is
necessary
and
its
abuses
can
be
minimized
otherwise
our
legislators
must
acknowledge
their
incapacity
to
deal
with
the
most
important
instrument
of
industry
in
the
hearing
of
the
industrial
commission
in
i
then
said
that
if
i
were
to
suggest
any
legislation
regarding
industrial
combinations
it
would
be
first
federal
legislation
under
which
corporations
may
be
created
and
regulated
if
that
be
possible
second
in
lieu
thereof
state
legislation
as
nearly
uniform
as
possible
encouraging
combinations
of
persons
and
capital
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
industries
but
permitting
state
supervision
not
of
a
character
to
hamper
industries
but
sufficient
to
prevent
frauds
upon
the
public
i
still
feel
as
i
did
in
the
new
opportunities
i
am
far
from
believing
that
this
will
adversely
affect
the
individual
the
great
economic
era
we
are
entering
will
give
splendid
opportunity
to
the
young
man
of
the
future
one
often
hears
the
men
of
this
new
generation
say
that
they
do
not
have
the
chances
that
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
had
how
little
they
know
of
the
disadvantages
from
which
we
suffered
in
my
young
manhood
we
had
everything
to
do
and
nothing
to
do
it
with
we
had
to
hew
our
own
paths
along
new
lines
we
had
little
experience
to
go
on
capital
was
most
difficult
to
get
credits
were
mysterious
things
whereas
now
we
have
a
system
of
commercial
ratings
everything
was
then
haphazard
and
we
suffered
from
a
stupendous
war
and
all
the
disasters
which
followed
compare
this
day
with
that
our
comforts
and
opportunities
are
multiplied
a
thousand
fold
the
resources
of
our
great
land
are
now
actually
opening
up
and
are
scarcely
touched
our
home
markets
are
vast
and
we
have
just
begun
to
think
of
the
foreign
peoples
we
can
serve
the
people
who
are
years
behind
us
in
civilization
in
the
east
a
quarter
of
the
human
race
is
just
awakening
the
men
of
this
generation
are
entering
into
a
heritage
which
makes
their
lives
look
by
comparison
i
am
naturally
an
optimist
and
when
it
comes
to
a
statement
of
what
our
people
will
accomplish
in
the
future
i
am
unable
to
express
myself
with
sufficient
enthusiasm
there
are
many
things
we
must
do
to
attain
the
highest
benefit
from
all
these
great
blessings
and
not
the
least
of
these
is
to
build
up
our
reputation
throughout
the
whole
world
the
great
business
interests
will
i
hope
so
comport
themselves
that
foreign
capital
will
consider
it
a
desirable
thing
to
hold
shares
in
american
companies
it
is
for
americans
to
see
that
foreign
investors
are
well
and
honestly
treated
so
that
they
will
never
regret
purchases
of
our
securities
i
may
speak
thus
frankly
because
i
am
an
investor
in
many
american
enterprises
but
a
controller
of
none
with
one
exception
and
that
a
company
which
has
not
been
much
of
a
dividend
payer
and
i
like
all
the
rest
am
dependent
upon
the
honest
and
capable
administration
of
the
industries
i
firmly
and
sincerely
believe
that
they
will
be
so
managed
the
american
business
man
you
hear
a
good
many
people
of
pessimistic
disposition
say
much
about
greed
in
american
life
one
would
think
to
hear
them
talk
that
we
were
a
race
of
misers
in
this
country
to
lay
too
much
stress
upon
the
reports
of
greed
in
the
newspapers
would
be
folly
since
their
function
is
to
report
the
unusual
and
even
the
abnormal
when
a
man
goes
properly
about
his
daily
affairs
the
public
prints
say
nothing
it
is
only
when
something
extraordinary
happens
to
him
that
he
is
discussed
but
because
he
is
thus
brought
into
prominence
occasionally
you
surely
would
not
say
that
these
occasions
represented
his
normal
life
it
is
by
no
means
for
money
alone
that
these
men
labour
they
are
engaged
in
a
fascinating
occupation
the
zest
of
the
work
is
maintained
by
something
better
than
the
mere
accumulation
of
money
and
as
i
think
i
have
said
elsewhere
the
standards
of
business
are
high
and
are
getting
better
all
the
time
i
confess
i
have
no
sympathy
with
the
idea
so
often
advanced
that
our
basis
of
all
judgments
in
this
country
is
founded
on
money
if
this
were
true
we
should
be
a
nation
of
money
hoarders
instead
of
spenders
nor
do
i
admit
that
we
are
so
a
people
as
to
be
jealous
of
the
success
of
others
it
is
the
other
way
about
we
are
the
most
extraordinarily
ambitious
and
the
success
of
one
man
in
any
walk
of
life
spurs
the
others
on
it
does
not
sour
them
and
it
is
a
libel
even
to
suggest
so
great
a
meanness
of
spirit
in
reading
the
newspapers
where
so
much
is
taken
for
granted
in
considering
things
on
a
money
standard
i
think
we
need
some
of
the
sense
of
humour
possessed
by
an
irish
neighbour
of
mine
who
built
what
we
regarded
as
an
extremely
ugly
house
which
stood
out
in
bright
colours
as
we
looked
from
our
windows
my
taste
in
architecture
differed
so
widely
from
that
affected
by
my
irish
friend
that
we
planted
out
the
view
of
his
house
by
moving
some
large
trees
to
the
end
of
our
property
another
neighbour
who
watched
this
work
going
on
asked
foley
why
rockefeller
moved
all
these
big
trees
and
cut
off
the
view
between
the
houses
foley
with
the
quick
wit
of
his
country
responded
instantly
it
invy
they
ca
stand
looking
at
the
ividence
of
me
prosperity
in
my
early
days
men
acted
just
as
they
do
now
no
doubt
when
there
was
anything
to
be
done
for
general
trade
betterment
almost
every
man
had
some
good
reason
for
believing
that
his
case
was
a
special
one
different
from
all
the
rest
for
every
foolish
thing
he
did
or
wanted
to
do
for
every
plan
he
had
he
always
pleaded
that
it
was
necessary
in
his
case
he
was
the
one
man
who
had
to
sell
at
less
than
cost
to
disrupt
all
the
business
plans
of
others
in
his
trade
because
his
individual
position
was
so
absolutely
different
from
all
the
rest
it
was
often
a
undertaking
to
convince
those
men
that
the
perfect
occasion
which
would
lead
to
the
perfect
opportunity
would
never
come
even
if
they
waited
until
the
crack
o
doom
then
again
we
had
the
type
of
man
who
really
never
knew
all
the
facts
about
his
own
affairs
many
of
the
brightest
kept
their
books
in
such
a
way
that
they
did
not
actually
know
when
they
were
making
money
on
a
certain
operation
and
when
they
were
losing
this
unintelligent
competition
was
a
hard
matter
to
contend
with
good
common
sense
has
always
been
a
mighty
rare
commodity
when
a
affairs
are
not
going
well
he
hates
to
study
the
books
and
face
the
truth
from
the
first
the
men
who
managed
the
standard
oil
company
kept
their
books
intelligently
as
well
as
correctly
we
knew
how
much
we
made
and
where
we
gained
or
lost
at
least
we
tried
not
to
deceive
ourselves
my
ideas
of
business
are
no
doubt
but
the
fundamental
principles
do
not
change
from
generation
to
generation
and
sometimes
i
think
that
our
american
business
men
whose
spirit
and
energy
are
so
splendid
do
not
always
sufficiently
study
the
real
underlying
foundations
of
business
management
i
have
spoken
of
the
necessity
of
being
frank
and
honest
with
oneself
about
one
own
affairs
many
people
assume
that
they
can
get
away
from
the
truth
by
avoiding
thinking
about
it
but
the
natural
law
is
inevitable
and
the
sooner
it
is
recognized
the
better
one
hears
a
great
deal
about
wages
and
why
they
must
be
maintained
at
a
high
level
by
the
railroads
for
example
a
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
no
less
but
no
more
and
in
the
long
run
he
must
contribute
an
equivalent
for
what
he
is
paid
if
he
does
not
do
this
he
is
probably
pauperized
and
you
at
once
throw
out
the
balance
of
things
you
ca
hold
up
conditions
artificially
and
you
ca
change
the
underlying
laws
of
trade
if
you
try
you
must
inevitably
fail
all
this
may
be
trite
and
obvious
but
it
is
remarkable
how
many
men
overlook
what
should
be
the
obvious
these
are
facts
we
ca
get
away
from
a
business
man
must
adapt
himself
to
the
natural
conditions
as
they
exist
from
month
to
month
and
year
to
year
sometimes
i
feel
that
we
americans
think
we
can
find
a
short
road
to
success
and
it
may
appear
that
often
this
feat
is
accomplished
but
real
efficiency
in
work
comes
from
knowing
your
facts
and
building
upon
that
sure
foundation
many
men
of
wealth
do
not
retire
from
business
even
when
they
can
they
are
not
willing
to
be
idle
or
they
have
a
just
pride
in
their
work
and
want
to
perfect
the
plans
in
which
they
have
faith
or
what
is
of
still
more
consequence
they
may
feel
the
call
to
expand
and
build
up
for
the
benefit
of
their
employees
and
associates
and
these
men
are
the
great
builders
up
in
our
country
consider
for
a
moment
how
much
would
have
been
left
undone
if
our
prosperous
american
business
men
had
sat
down
with
folded
hands
when
they
had
acquired
a
competency
i
have
respect
for
all
these
reasons
but
if
a
man
has
succeeded
he
has
brought
upon
himself
corresponding
responsibilities
and
our
institutions
devoted
to
helping
men
to
help
themselves
need
the
brain
of
the
american
business
man
as
well
as
part
of
his
money
some
of
these
men
however
are
so
absorbed
in
their
business
affairs
that
they
hardly
have
time
to
think
of
anything
else
if
they
do
interest
themselves
in
a
work
outside
of
their
own
office
and
undertake
to
raise
money
they
begin
with
an
apology
as
if
they
are
ashamed
of
themselves
i
am
no
beggar
i
have
heard
many
of
them
say
to
which
i
could
only
reply
i
am
sorry
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
have
been
this
sort
of
beggar
all
my
life
and
the
experiences
i
have
had
were
so
interesting
and
important
to
me
that
i
will
venture
to
speak
of
them
in
a
later
chapter
chapter
iv
some
experiences
in
the
oil
business
during
the
years
when
i
was
just
coming
to
man
estate
the
produce
business
of
clark
rockefeller
went
on
prosperously
and
in
the
early
sixties
we
organized
a
firm
to
refine
and
deal
in
oil
it
was
composed
of
james
and
richard
clark
samuel
andrews
and
the
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
who
were
the
company
it
was
my
first
direct
connection
with
the
oil
trade
as
the
new
concern
grew
the
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
was
called
upon
to
supply
a
large
special
capital
samuel
andrews
was
the
manufacturing
man
of
the
concern
and
he
had
learned
the
process
of
cleansing
the
crude
oil
by
the
use
of
sulphuric
acid
in
the
partnership
was
dissolved
it
was
decided
that
the
cash
assets
should
be
collected
and
the
debts
paid
but
this
left
the
plant
and
the
to
be
disposed
of
it
was
suggested
that
they
should
go
to
the
highest
bidder
among
ourselves
this
seemed
a
just
settlement
to
me
and
the
question
came
up
as
to
when
the
sale
should
be
held
and
who
would
conduct
it
my
partners
had
a
lawyer
in
the
room
to
represent
them
though
i
had
not
considered
having
a
legal
representative
i
thought
i
could
take
care
of
so
simple
a
transaction
the
lawyer
acted
as
the
auctioneer
and
it
was
suggested
that
we
should
go
on
with
the
sale
then
and
there
all
agreed
and
so
the
auction
began
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
wanted
to
go
into
the
oil
trade
not
as
a
special
partner
but
actively
on
a
larger
scale
and
with
andrews
wished
to
buy
that
business
i
thought
that
i
saw
great
opportunities
in
refining
oil
and
did
not
realize
at
that
time
that
the
whole
oil
industry
would
soon
be
swamped
by
so
many
men
rushing
into
it
but
i
was
full
of
hope
and
i
had
already
arranged
to
get
financial
accommodation
to
an
amount
that
i
supposed
would
easily
pay
for
the
plant
and
i
was
willing
to
give
up
the
other
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
and
readily
settled
that
later
my
old
partner
clark
taking
over
the
business
the
bidding
began
i
think
at
premium
i
bid
a
thousand
they
bid
two
thousand
and
so
on
little
by
little
the
price
went
up
neither
side
was
willing
to
stop
bidding
and
the
amount
gradually
rose
until
it
reached
which
was
much
more
than
we
supposed
the
concern
to
be
worth
finally
it
advanced
to
and
by
slow
stages
to
and
i
almost
feared
for
my
ability
to
buy
the
business
and
have
the
money
to
pay
for
it
at
last
the
other
side
bid
without
hesitation
i
said
clark
then
said
i
go
no
higher
john
the
business
is
yours
shall
i
give
you
a
check
for
it
now
i
suggested
no
clark
said
i
glad
to
trust
you
for
it
settle
at
your
convenience
the
firm
of
rockefeller
andrews
was
then
established
and
this
was
really
my
start
in
the
oil
trade
it
was
my
most
important
business
for
about
forty
years
until
at
the
age
of
about
i
retired
the
story
of
the
early
history
of
the
oil
trade
is
too
well
known
to
bear
repeating
in
detail
the
cleansing
of
crude
petroleum
was
a
simple
and
easy
process
and
at
first
the
profits
were
very
large
naturally
all
sorts
of
people
went
into
it
the
butcher
the
baker
and
the
began
to
refine
oil
and
it
was
only
a
short
time
before
more
of
the
finished
product
was
put
on
the
market
than
could
possibly
be
consumed
the
price
went
down
and
down
until
the
trade
was
threatened
with
ruin
it
seemed
absolutely
necessary
to
extend
the
market
for
oil
by
exporting
to
foreign
countries
which
required
a
long
and
most
difficult
development
and
also
to
greatly
improve
the
processes
of
refining
so
that
oil
could
be
made
and
sold
cheaply
yet
with
a
profit
and
to
use
as
all
of
the
materials
which
in
the
plants
were
lost
or
thrown
away
these
were
the
problems
which
confronted
us
almost
at
the
outset
and
this
great
depression
led
to
consultations
with
our
neighbors
and
friends
in
the
business
in
the
effort
to
bring
some
order
out
of
what
was
rapidly
becoming
a
state
of
chaos
to
accomplish
all
these
tasks
of
enlarging
the
market
and
improving
the
methods
of
manufacture
in
a
large
way
was
beyond
the
power
or
ability
of
any
concern
as
then
constituted
it
could
only
be
done
we
reasoned
by
increasing
our
capital
and
availing
ourselves
of
the
best
talent
and
experience
it
was
with
this
idea
that
we
proceeded
to
buy
the
largest
and
best
refining
concerns
and
centralize
the
administration
of
them
with
a
view
to
securing
greater
economy
and
efficiency
the
business
grew
faster
than
we
had
anticipated
this
enterprise
conducted
by
men
of
application
and
ability
working
hard
together
soon
built
up
unusual
facilities
in
manufacture
in
transportation
in
finance
and
in
extending
markets
we
had
our
troubles
and
we
suffered
from
some
severe
fires
and
the
supply
of
crude
oil
was
most
uncertain
our
plans
were
constantly
changed
by
changed
conditions
we
developed
great
facilities
in
an
oil
centre
erected
storage
tanks
and
connected
then
the
oil
failed
and
our
work
was
thrown
away
at
best
it
was
a
speculative
trade
and
i
wonder
that
we
managed
to
pull
through
so
often
but
we
were
gradually
learning
how
to
conduct
a
most
difficult
business
foreign
markets
several
years
ago
when
asked
how
our
business
grew
to
such
large
proportions
i
explained
that
our
first
organization
was
a
partnership
and
afterward
a
corporation
in
ohio
that
was
sufficient
for
a
local
refining
business
but
had
we
been
dependent
solely
upon
local
business
we
should
have
failed
long
since
we
were
forced
to
extend
our
markets
into
every
part
of
the
world
this
made
the
cities
a
necessary
place
of
business
and
we
soon
discovered
that
manufacturing
for
export
could
be
more
economically
carried
on
there
hence
refineries
were
established
at
brooklyn
at
bayonne
at
philadelphia
at
baltimore
and
necessary
corporations
were
organized
in
the
different
states
we
soon
discovered
as
the
business
grew
that
the
primary
method
of
transporting
oil
in
barrels
could
not
last
the
package
often
cost
more
than
the
contents
and
the
forests
of
the
country
were
not
sufficient
to
supply
cheaply
the
necessary
material
for
an
extended
time
hence
we
devoted
attention
to
other
methods
of
transportation
adopted
the
system
and
found
capital
for
construction
equal
to
the
necessities
of
the
business
to
operate
required
franchises
from
the
states
in
which
they
were
located
and
consequently
corporations
in
those
states
just
as
railroads
running
through
different
states
are
forced
to
operate
under
separate
state
charters
to
perfect
the
system
of
transportation
required
many
millions
of
capital
the
entire
oil
business
is
dependent
upon
the
without
it
every
well
would
be
less
valuable
and
every
market
at
home
and
abroad
would
be
more
difficult
to
serve
or
retain
because
of
the
additional
cost
to
the
consumer
the
expansion
of
the
whole
industry
would
have
been
retarded
without
this
method
of
transportation
then
the
system
required
other
improvements
such
as
upon
railroads
and
finally
the
capital
had
to
be
furnished
for
them
and
corporations
created
to
own
and
operate
them
everyone
of
the
steps
taken
was
necessary
if
the
business
was
to
be
properly
developed
and
only
through
such
successive
steps
and
by
a
great
aggregation
of
capital
is
america
enabled
to
utilize
the
bounty
which
its
land
pours
forth
and
to
furnish
the
world
with
light
the
start
of
the
standard
oil
company
in
the
year
the
firms
of
william
rockefeller
rockefeller
andrews
rockefeller
and
harkness
and
flagler
united
in
forming
the
firm
of
rockefeller
andrews
flagler
the
cause
leading
to
the
formation
of
this
firm
was
the
desire
to
unite
our
skill
and
capital
in
order
to
carry
on
a
business
of
greater
magnitude
with
economy
and
efficiency
in
place
of
the
smaller
business
that
each
had
heretofore
conducted
separately
as
time
went
on
and
the
possibilities
became
apparent
we
found
further
capital
to
be
necessary
then
we
interested
others
and
organized
the
standard
oil
company
with
a
capital
of
later
we
saw
that
more
money
could
be
utilized
found
persons
who
were
willing
to
invest
with
us
and
increased
our
capital
to
in
and
afterward
in
to
as
the
business
grew
and
markets
were
obtained
at
home
and
abroad
more
persons
and
capital
were
added
to
the
business
and
new
corporate
agencies
were
obtained
or
organized
the
object
being
always
the
same
to
extend
our
operations
by
furnishing
the
best
and
cheapest
products
i
ascribe
the
success
of
the
standard
oil
company
to
its
consistent
policy
of
making
the
volume
of
its
business
large
through
the
merit
and
cheapness
of
its
products
it
has
spared
no
expense
in
utilizing
the
best
and
most
efficient
method
of
manufacture
it
has
sought
for
the
best
superintendents
and
workmen
and
paid
the
best
wages
it
has
not
hesitated
to
sacrifice
old
machinery
and
old
plants
for
new
and
better
ones
it
has
placed
its
manufactories
at
the
points
where
they
could
supply
markets
at
the
least
expense
it
has
not
only
sought
markets
for
its
principal
products
but
for
all
possible
sparing
no
expense
in
introducing
them
to
the
public
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
world
it
has
not
hesitated
to
invest
millions
of
dollars
in
methods
for
cheapening
the
gathering
and
distribution
of
oils
by
special
cars
and
it
has
erected
at
railroad
centres
in
every
part
of
the
country
to
cheapen
the
storage
and
delivery
of
oil
it
has
had
faith
in
american
oil
and
has
brought
together
vast
sums
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
what
it
is
and
for
holding
its
market
against
the
competition
of
russia
and
all
the
countries
which
are
producers
of
oil
and
competitors
against
american
products
the
insurance
plans
here
is
an
example
of
one
of
the
ways
in
which
we
achieved
certain
economies
and
gained
real
advantage
fires
are
always
to
be
reckoned
with
in
oil
refining
and
storage
as
we
learned
by
dear
experience
but
in
having
our
plants
distributed
all
over
the
country
the
unit
of
risk
and
possible
loss
was
minimized
no
one
fire
could
ruin
us
and
we
were
able
thus
to
establish
a
system
of
insuring
ourselves
our
reserve
fund
which
provided
for
this
insurance
could
not
be
wiped
out
all
at
once
as
might
be
the
case
with
a
concern
having
its
plants
together
or
near
each
other
then
we
studied
and
perfected
our
organization
to
prevent
fires
improving
our
appliances
and
plans
year
after
year
until
the
profit
on
this
insurance
feature
became
a
very
considerable
item
in
the
standard
earnings
it
can
easily
be
seen
that
this
saving
in
insurance
and
minimizing
the
loss
by
fire
affected
the
profits
not
only
in
refining
but
touched
many
other
associated
enterprises
the
manufacture
of
the
tanks
and
steamers
the
etc
we
devoted
ourselves
exclusively
to
the
oil
business
and
its
products
the
company
never
went
into
outside
ventures
but
kept
to
the
enormous
task
of
perfecting
its
own
organization
we
educated
our
own
men
we
trained
many
of
them
from
boyhood
we
strove
to
keep
them
loyal
by
providing
them
full
scope
for
their
ability
they
were
given
opportunities
to
buy
stock
and
the
company
itself
helped
them
to
finance
their
purchases
not
only
here
in
america
but
all
over
the
world
our
young
men
were
given
chances
to
advance
themselves
and
the
sons
of
the
old
partners
were
welcomed
to
the
councils
and
responsibilities
of
the
administration
i
may
say
that
the
company
has
been
in
all
its
history
and
i
am
sure
it
is
at
present
a
most
happy
association
of
busy
people
i
have
been
asked
if
my
advice
is
not
often
sought
by
the
present
managers
i
can
say
that
if
it
were
sought
it
would
be
gladly
given
but
the
fact
is
that
since
i
retired
it
has
been
very
little
required
i
am
still
a
large
stockholder
indeed
i
have
increased
my
holdings
in
the
company
stock
since
i
relinquished
any
part
in
its
management
why
the
standard
pays
large
dividends
let
me
explain
what
many
people
perhaps
fully
appreciate
but
some
i
am
sure
do
not
the
standard
pays
four
dividends
a
year
the
first
in
march
which
is
the
result
of
the
busiest
season
of
the
whole
twelvemonth
because
more
oil
is
consumed
in
winter
than
at
other
seasons
and
three
other
dividends
later
at
about
evenly
divided
periods
now
these
dividends
run
up
to
per
cent
on
the
capital
stock
of
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
profit
is
per
cent
on
the
capital
invested
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
represents
the
results
of
the
savings
and
surplus
gained
through
all
the
or
forty
years
of
the
workings
of
the
companies
the
capital
stock
could
be
raised
several
hundred
per
cent
without
a
penny
of
or
water
the
actual
value
is
there
if
this
increase
had
been
made
the
rate
would
represent
a
moderate
power
of
about
to
per
cent
a
normal
growth
study
for
a
moment
the
result
of
what
has
been
a
natural
and
absolutely
normal
increase
in
the
value
of
the
company
possessions
many
of
the
were
constructed
during
a
period
when
costs
were
about
per
cent
of
what
they
are
now
great
fields
of
oil
lands
were
purchased
as
virgin
soil
which
later
yielded
an
immense
output
quantities
of
crude
oil
which
had
been
bought
by
the
company
when
it
was
believed
to
be
of
little
value
but
which
the
company
hoped
eventually
to
utilize
were
greatly
increased
in
value
by
inventions
for
refining
it
and
for
using
the
residues
formerly
considered
almost
worthless
dock
property
was
secured
at
low
prices
and
made
valuable
by
buildings
and
development
large
unimproved
tracts
of
land
near
the
important
business
centres
were
acquired
we
brought
our
industries
to
these
places
made
the
land
useful
and
increased
the
value
not
only
of
our
own
property
but
of
the
land
adjacent
to
it
to
many
times
the
original
worth
wherever
we
have
established
businesses
in
this
and
other
countries
we
have
bought
largely
of
property
i
remember
a
case
where
we
paid
only
or
so
an
acre
for
some
rough
land
to
be
used
for
such
purposes
and
through
the
improvements
we
created
the
value
has
gone
up
or
times
as
much
in
or
years
others
have
had
similar
increases
in
the
value
of
their
properties
but
have
enlarged
their
capitalization
correspondingly
they
have
escaped
the
criticism
which
has
been
directed
against
us
who
with
our
and
conservative
notions
have
continued
without
such
expansion
of
capitalization
there
is
nothing
strange
or
miraculous
in
all
this
it
was
all
done
through
this
natural
law
of
trade
development
it
is
what
the
astors
and
many
other
large
landholders
did
if
a
man
starts
in
business
with
capital
and
gradually
increases
his
property
and
investment
by
retaining
in
his
concern
much
of
his
earnings
instead
of
spending
them
and
thus
accumulates
values
until
his
investment
is
say
it
would
be
folly
to
base
the
percentage
of
his
actual
profits
only
on
the
original
with
which
he
started
here
again
i
think
the
managers
of
the
standard
should
be
praised
and
not
blamed
they
have
set
an
example
for
upbuilding
on
the
most
conservative
lines
and
in
a
business
which
has
always
been
to
say
the
least
hazardous
and
to
a
large
degree
unavoidably
speculative
yet
no
one
who
has
relied
upon
the
ownership
of
this
stock
to
pay
a
yearly
income
has
been
disappointed
and
the
stock
is
held
by
an
increasing
number
of
small
holders
the
country
over
the
management
of
capital
we
never
attempted
as
i
have
already
said
to
sell
the
standard
oil
stock
on
the
market
through
the
stock
exchange
in
the
early
days
the
risks
of
the
business
were
great
and
if
the
stock
had
been
dealt
in
on
the
exchange
its
fluctuations
would
no
doubt
have
been
violent
we
preferred
to
have
the
attention
of
the
owners
and
administrators
of
the
business
directed
wholly
to
the
legitimate
development
of
the
enterprise
rather
than
to
speculation
in
its
shares
the
interests
of
the
company
have
been
carefully
conserved
we
have
been
criticized
for
paying
large
dividends
on
a
capitalization
which
represents
but
a
small
part
of
the
actual
property
owned
by
the
company
if
we
had
increased
the
capitalization
to
bring
it
up
to
the
real
value
and
listed
the
shares
on
the
exchange
we
might
have
been
criticized
then
for
promoting
a
project
to
induce
the
public
to
invest
as
i
have
indicated
the
foundations
of
the
company
were
so
thoroughly
established
and
its
affairs
so
conservatively
managed
that
after
the
earlier
period
of
struggle
to
secure
adequate
capital
and
in
view
of
the
trying
experiences
through
which
we
then
passed
we
decided
to
pursue
the
policy
of
relying
upon
our
own
resources
since
then
we
have
never
been
obliged
to
lean
very
heavily
upon
the
financial
public
but
have
sought
rather
to
hold
ourselves
in
position
not
only
to
protect
our
own
large
and
important
interests
but
to
be
prepared
in
times
of
stress
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
others
the
company
has
suffered
from
the
statements
of
people
who
i
am
convinced
are
not
familiar
with
all
the
facts
as
i
long
ago
ceased
to
have
any
active
part
in
the
management
of
its
affairs
perhaps
i
may
venture
the
opinion
that
men
who
devote
themselves
to
building
up
the
sale
of
american
products
all
over
the
world
in
competition
with
foreign
manufacturers
should
be
appreciated
and
encouraged
there
have
been
so
many
tales
told
about
the
speculations
of
the
standard
oil
company
that
i
may
say
a
word
about
that
subject
this
company
is
interested
only
in
oil
products
and
such
manufacturing
affairs
as
are
legitimately
connected
therewith
it
has
plants
for
the
making
of
barrels
and
tanks
and
building
pumps
for
pumping
oil
it
owns
vessels
for
carrying
oil
pipes
for
transporting
oil
but
it
is
not
concerned
in
speculative
interests
the
oil
business
itself
is
speculative
enough
and
its
successful
administration
requires
a
firm
hand
and
a
cool
head
the
company
pays
dividends
to
its
stockholders
which
it
earns
in
carrying
on
this
oil
trade
this
money
the
stockholders
can
and
do
use
as
they
think
fit
but
the
company
is
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
disposition
that
the
stockholders
make
of
their
dividends
the
standard
oil
company
does
not
own
or
control
a
chain
of
banks
nor
has
it
any
interest
directly
or
indirectly
in
any
bank
its
relations
are
confined
to
the
functions
of
ordinary
banking
such
as
other
depositors
have
it
buys
and
sells
its
own
exchange
and
these
dealings
extending
over
many
years
have
made
its
bills
of
exchange
acceptable
all
over
the
world
character
the
essential
thing
in
speaking
of
the
real
beginning
of
the
standard
oil
company
it
should
be
remembered
that
it
was
not
so
much
the
consolidation
of
the
firms
in
which
we
had
a
personal
interest
but
the
coming
together
of
the
men
who
had
the
combined
brain
power
to
do
the
work
which
was
the
actual
perhaps
it
is
worth
while
to
emphasize
again
the
fact
that
it
is
not
merely
capital
and
plants
and
the
strictly
material
things
which
make
up
a
business
but
the
character
of
the
men
behind
these
things
their
personalities
and
their
abilities
these
are
the
essentials
to
be
reckoned
with
late
in
we
began
the
purchase
of
some
of
the
more
important
of
the
refinery
interests
of
cleveland
the
conditions
were
so
chaotic
and
uncertain
that
most
of
the
refiners
were
very
desirous
to
get
out
of
the
business
we
invariably
offered
those
who
wanted
to
sell
the
option
of
taking
cash
or
stock
in
the
company
we
very
much
preferred
to
have
them
take
the
stock
because
a
dollar
in
those
days
looked
as
large
as
a
but
as
a
matter
of
business
policy
we
found
it
desirable
to
offer
them
the
option
and
in
most
cases
they
were
even
precipitate
in
their
choice
of
the
cash
they
knew
what
a
dollar
would
buy
but
they
were
very
sceptical
in
regard
to
the
possibilities
of
resurrecting
the
oil
business
and
giving
any
permanent
value
to
these
shares
these
purchases
continued
over
a
period
of
years
during
which
many
of
the
more
important
refineries
at
cleveland
were
bought
by
the
standard
oil
company
some
of
the
smaller
concerns
however
continued
in
the
business
for
many
years
although
they
had
the
same
opportunity
as
others
to
sell
there
were
always
at
other
refining
points
which
were
regarded
as
more
favourably
located
than
cleveland
many
refineries
in
successful
operation
the
backus
purchase
all
these
purchases
of
refineries
were
conducted
with
the
utmost
fairness
and
good
faith
on
our
part
yet
in
many
quarters
the
stories
of
certain
of
these
transactions
have
been
told
in
such
form
as
to
give
the
impression
that
the
sales
were
made
most
unwillingly
and
only
because
the
sellers
were
forced
to
make
them
by
the
most
ruthless
exertion
of
superior
power
there
was
one
transaction
the
purchase
of
the
property
of
the
backus
oil
company
which
has
been
variously
exploited
and
i
am
made
to
appear
as
having
personally
robbed
a
defenceless
widow
of
an
extremely
valuable
property
paying
her
therefor
only
a
mere
fraction
of
its
worth
the
story
as
told
is
one
which
makes
the
strongest
appeal
to
the
sympathy
and
if
it
were
true
would
represent
a
shocking
instance
of
cruelty
in
crushing
a
defenceless
woman
it
is
probable
that
its
wide
circulation
and
its
acceptance
as
true
by
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
facts
has
awakened
more
hostility
against
the
standard
oil
company
and
against
me
personally
than
any
charge
which
has
been
made
this
is
my
reason
for
entering
so
much
into
detail
in
this
particular
case
which
i
am
exceedingly
reluctant
to
do
and
for
many
years
have
refrained
from
doing
backus
a
highly
respected
citizen
of
cleveland
and
an
old
and
personal
friend
of
mine
had
for
several
years
prior
to
his
death
in
been
engaged
in
the
lubricating
oil
business
which
was
carried
on
after
his
death
as
a
corporation
known
as
the
backus
oil
company
in
the
latter
part
of
our
company
purchased
certain
portions
of
the
property
of
this
company
the
negotiations
which
led
to
this
purchase
extended
over
several
weeks
being
conducted
on
behalf
of
backus
as
the
principal
stockholder
by
charles
marr
and
on
behalf
of
our
company
by
peter
jennings
i
personally
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
negotiations
except
that
when
the
matter
first
came
up
backus
requested
me
to
call
at
her
house
which
i
did
when
she
spoke
of
selling
the
property
to
our
company
and
requested
me
to
personally
conduct
the
negotiations
with
her
with
reference
to
it
this
i
was
obliged
to
decline
to
do
because
as
i
then
explained
to
her
i
was
not
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
business
in
that
conversation
i
advised
her
not
to
take
any
hasty
action
and
when
she
expressed
fears
about
the
future
of
the
business
stating
for
example
that
she
could
not
get
cars
to
transport
sufficient
oil
i
said
to
her
that
though
we
were
using
our
cars
and
required
them
in
our
business
yet
we
would
loan
her
any
number
she
needed
and
do
anything
else
in
reason
to
assist
her
and
i
did
not
see
why
she
could
not
successfully
prosecute
her
business
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
i
told
her
however
that
if
after
reflection
she
desired
to
pursue
negotiations
for
the
sale
of
her
property
some
of
our
people
familiar
with
the
lubricating
oil
business
would
take
up
the
question
with
her
as
she
still
expressed
a
desire
to
have
our
company
buy
her
property
negotiations
were
taken
up
by
jennings
and
the
only
other
thing
that
i
had
to
do
with
the
matter
was
that
when
our
experts
reported
that
in
their
judgment
the
value
of
the
works
good
will
and
successorship
which
we
had
decided
to
buy
were
worth
a
certain
sum
i
asked
them
to
add
in
order
to
make
doubly
sure
that
she
received
full
value
the
sale
was
consummated
as
we
supposed
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
backus
and
the
purchase
price
which
had
been
agreed
upon
was
paid
to
my
profound
astonishment
a
day
or
two
after
the
transaction
had
been
closed
i
received
from
her
a
very
unkind
letter
complaining
that
she
had
been
unjustly
treated
after
investigating
the
matter
i
wrote
her
the
following
letter
november
dear
madam
i
have
held
your
note
of
the
received
yesterday
until
as
i
wished
to
thoroughly
review
every
point
connected
with
the
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
the
stock
of
the
backus
oil
company
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
whether
i
had
unwittingly
done
anything
whereby
you
could
have
any
right
to
feel
injured
it
is
true
that
in
the
interview
i
had
with
you
i
suggested
that
if
you
desired
to
do
so
you
could
retain
an
interest
in
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
by
keeping
some
number
of
its
shares
and
then
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
you
sold
out
you
wished
to
go
entirely
out
of
the
business
that
being
my
understanding
our
arrangements
were
made
in
case
you
concluded
to
make
the
sale
that
precluded
any
other
interests
being
represented
and
therefore
when
you
did
make
the
inquiry
as
to
your
taking
some
of
the
stock
our
answer
was
given
in
accordance
with
the
facts
noted
above
but
not
at
all
in
the
spirit
in
which
you
refer
to
the
refusal
in
your
note
in
regard
to
the
reference
that
you
make
as
to
my
permitting
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
to
from
you
i
say
that
in
this
as
in
all
else
you
have
written
in
your
letter
of
the
you
do
me
most
grievous
wrong
it
was
but
of
little
moment
to
the
interests
represented
by
me
whether
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
was
purchased
or
not
i
believe
that
it
was
for
your
interest
to
make
the
sale
and
am
entirely
candid
in
this
statement
and
beg
to
call
your
attention
to
the
time
some
two
years
ago
when
you
consulted
flagler
and
myself
as
to
selling
out
your
interests
to
rose
at
which
time
you
were
desirous
of
selling
at
less
and
upon
time
than
you
have
now
received
in
cash
and
which
sale
you
would
have
been
glad
to
have
closed
if
you
could
have
obtained
satisfactory
security
for
the
deferred
payments
as
to
the
price
paid
for
the
property
it
is
certainly
three
times
greater
than
the
cost
at
which
we
could
now
construct
equal
or
better
facilities
but
wishing
to
take
a
liberal
view
of
it
i
urged
the
proposal
of
paying
which
was
thought
much
too
high
by
some
of
our
parties
i
believe
that
if
you
would
reconsider
what
you
have
written
in
your
letter
to
which
this
is
a
reply
you
must
admit
having
done
me
great
injustice
and
i
am
satisfied
to
await
upon
your
innate
sense
of
right
for
such
admission
however
in
view
of
what
seems
to
be
your
present
feeling
i
now
offer
to
restore
to
you
the
purchase
made
by
us
you
simply
returning
the
amount
of
money
which
we
have
invested
and
leaving
us
as
though
no
purchase
has
been
made
should
you
not
desire
to
accept
this
proposal
i
offer
to
you
or
shares
of
the
stock
at
the
same
price
that
we
paid
for
the
same
with
this
addition
that
if
we
keep
the
property
we
are
under
engagement
to
pay
into
the
treasury
of
the
backus
oil
company
any
amount
which
added
to
the
amount
already
paid
would
make
a
total
of
and
thereby
make
the
shares
each
that
you
may
not
be
compelled
to
hastily
come
to
a
conclusion
i
will
leave
open
for
three
days
these
propositions
for
your
acceptance
or
declination
and
in
the
meantime
believe
me
yours
very
truly
john
rockefeller
neither
of
these
offers
was
accepted
in
order
that
this
may
not
rest
on
my
unsupported
assertion
i
submit
the
following
documents
the
first
is
a
letter
from
backus
a
brother
of
deceased
husband
who
had
been
associated
with
the
business
and
had
remained
with
the
company
after
his
death
the
letter
was
written
without
any
solicitation
whatever
on
my
part
but
i
have
since
received
permission
from
backus
to
print
it
it
is
followed
by
extracts
from
affidavits
made
by
the
gentleman
who
conducted
the
negotiations
on
behalf
of
backus
i
have
no
wish
to
reprint
the
complimentary
allusion
to
myself
in
backus
letter
but
have
feared
to
omit
a
word
of
it
lest
some
misunderstanding
ensue
bowling
green
ohio
september
john
rockefeller
cleveland
ohio
i
do
not
know
whether
you
will
ever
receive
this
letter
or
not
whether
your
secretary
will
throw
it
into
the
or
not
but
i
will
do
my
part
and
get
it
off
my
mind
and
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
you
do
not
receive
or
read
it
ever
since
the
day
that
my
deceased
brother
wife
backus
wrote
you
the
unjust
and
unreasonable
letter
in
reference
to
the
sale
of
the
property
of
the
old
backus
oil
company
in
which
i
had
a
small
interest
i
have
wanted
to
write
you
and
record
my
disapproval
of
that
letter
i
lived
with
my
brother
family
was
at
the
house
the
day
you
called
to
talk
the
matter
of
the
then
proposed
purchase
of
the
property
with
backus
by
her
request
as
she
told
jennings
that
she
wanted
to
deal
through
you
i
was
in
favour
of
the
sale
from
the
first
i
was
with
backus
all
through
the
trouble
with
rose
and
with
maloney
did
what
i
could
to
encourage
her
and
to
prevent
rose
from
getting
the
best
of
her
backus
in
my
opinion
is
an
exceptionally
good
financier
but
she
does
not
know
and
no
one
can
convince
her
that
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
her
financially
was
the
sale
of
her
interest
in
the
backus
oil
company
to
your
people
she
does
not
know
that
five
more
years
of
the
then
increasing
desperate
competition
would
have
bankrupted
the
company
and
that
with
the
big
debt
that
she
was
carrying
on
the
lot
on
euclid
avenue
near
sheriff
street
she
would
have
been
swamped
and
that
the
only
thing
that
ever
saved
her
and
the
oil
business
generally
was
the
plan
of
john
rockefeller
she
thinks
that
you
literally
robbed
her
of
millions
and
feeds
her
children
on
that
diet
three
times
a
day
more
or
less
principally
more
until
it
has
become
a
mania
with
her
and
no
argument
that
any
one
else
can
suggest
will
have
any
effect
upon
her
she
is
wise
and
good
in
many
ways
but
on
that
one
subject
she
is
i
think
of
course
if
we
could
have
been
assured
of
continued
dividends
i
would
have
been
opposed
to
selling
the
business
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
i
know
of
the
ten
thousand
dollars
that
was
added
to
the
purchase
price
of
the
property
at
your
request
and
i
know
that
you
paid
three
times
the
value
of
the
property
and
i
know
that
all
that
ever
saved
our
company
from
ruin
was
the
sale
of
its
property
to
you
and
i
simply
want
to
ease
my
mind
by
doing
justice
to
you
by
saying
so
after
the
sale
to
your
company
i
was
simple
enough
to
go
to
buffalo
and
try
it
again
but
soon
met
with
defeat
and
retired
with
my
flag
in
the
dust
i
then
went
to
duluth
and
was
on
the
top
wave
till
the
bubble
broke
and
i
broke
with
it
i
have
had
my
ups
and
downs
but
i
have
tried
to
take
my
medicine
and
look
pleasant
instead
of
sitting
down
under
a
juniper
tree
and
blaming
my
losses
to
john
rockefeller
i
suppose
i
would
have
put
off
writing
this
letter
for
another
year
or
more
as
i
have
done
so
long
had
it
not
been
for
a
little
chat
that
i
had
with
hanafin
superintendent
of
the
buckeye
pipe
line
company
a
day
or
two
since
when
i
was
relating
the
sale
of
the
old
business
and
in
that
way
revived
the
intention
that
had
lain
dormant
since
the
last
good
resolution
in
regard
to
writing
it
was
made
but
it
done
now
and
off
my
mind
with
much
respect
and
admiration
to
john
rockefeller
i
remain
yours
truly
backus
it
appears
from
the
affidavits
that
the
negotiations
were
conducted
on
behalf
of
backus
and
her
company
by
charles
marr
who
had
been
in
the
employ
of
the
backus
company
for
some
time
and
by
maloney
who
was
the
superintendent
of
the
company
from
the
time
of
its
organization
and
was
also
a
stockholder
and
on
behalf
of
the
standard
oil
company
by
peter
jennings
there
has
been
an
impression
that
the
standard
oil
company
purchased
for
property
which
was
reasonably
worth
much
more
and
that
this
sacrifice
was
occasioned
by
threats
and
compulsion
jennings
requested
marr
to
submit
a
written
proposition
giving
the
price
put
by
the
backus
company
upon
the
several
items
of
property
and
assets
which
it
desired
to
sell
this
statement
was
furnished
and
was
annexed
to
jennings
affidavit
the
standard
oil
company
finally
decided
not
to
purchase
all
of
the
assets
of
the
company
but
only
the
oil
on
hand
for
which
it
paid
the
full
market
price
amounting
to
about
and
the
item
works
and
successorship
which
were
offered
by
marr
at
and
for
which
the
standard
offered
which
was
promptly
accepted
marr
made
affidavit
as
follows
charles
marr
being
duly
sworn
says
that
in
behalf
of
the
backus
oil
company
he
conducted
the
negotiations
which
led
to
the
sale
of
its
works
and
stock
of
oils
and
during
same
when
said
company
had
offered
to
sell
its
entire
stock
for
a
gross
sum
to
wit
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
which
was
to
include
cash
on
hand
accrued
dividends
accounts
said
jennings
requested
said
company
to
submit
an
itemized
proposition
fixing
values
upon
different
articles
proposed
to
be
sold
and
that
he
after
full
consideration
with
backus
and
with
her
knowledge
and
consent
submitted
the
written
proposition
attached
to
said
jennings
affidavit
that
the
same
is
in
his
handwriting
and
was
copied
at
the
office
of
the
american
lubricating
oil
company
from
the
original
by
himself
at
the
request
of
said
jennings
and
said
original
was
submitted
by
affiant
to
backus
that
she
was
fully
cognizant
of
all
the
details
of
said
negotiations
and
the
items
and
values
attached
thereto
in
said
proposition
consulted
with
at
every
step
thereof
none
of
which
were
taken
without
her
advice
as
she
was
by
far
the
largest
stockholder
in
said
backus
oil
company
owning
about
of
said
company
stock
and
she
fully
approved
of
said
proposition
and
accepted
the
offer
of
said
jennings
to
pay
sixty
thousand
dollars
for
the
item
works
and
successorship
without
any
opposition
so
far
as
affiant
knows
and
affiant
says
that
the
amount
realized
from
the
assets
of
the
backus
oil
company
including
purchase
price
has
been
about
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
and
a
part
of
its
assets
have
not
yet
been
converted
into
money
as
affiant
is
informed
marr
who
was
it
will
be
remembered
the
widow
representative
refers
to
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
purchase
and
says
but
affiant
says
that
nothing
that
was
said
by
jennings
or
anybody
else
during
their
progress
could
be
construed
into
a
threat
nor
did
anything
that
was
said
or
done
by
said
jennings
hasten
or
push
forward
said
trade
he
also
says
affiant
says
that
the
negotiations
extended
over
a
period
of
from
two
to
three
weeks
and
during
their
pendency
that
backus
frequently
urged
affiant
to
bring
the
same
to
a
conclusion
as
she
was
anxious
to
dispose
of
said
business
and
relieve
herself
from
further
care
and
responsibility
therewith
and
when
the
said
offer
of
purchase
by
said
jennings
upon
the
terms
aforesaid
was
conveyed
to
her
by
affiant
she
expressed
herself
as
entirely
satisfied
therewith
maloney
made
an
affidavit
that
he
was
superintendent
of
the
backus
oil
company
from
the
time
of
its
organization
and
also
a
stockholder
in
the
company
and
had
been
associated
in
business
with
backus
for
many
years
previous
to
his
death
that
he
took
part
in
the
negotiations
for
the
sale
representing
backus
in
the
matter
after
speaking
of
the
negotiations
he
says
finally
after
consultation
the
proposition
was
made
by
her
to
dispose
of
the
works
and
successorship
for
a
few
days
after
the
proposal
was
made
to
her
to
pay
the
sum
of
for
works
and
and
to
take
the
oil
on
hand
at
its
market
price
which
proposition
she
accepted
and
the
sale
was
concluded
during
these
negotiations
backus
was
anxious
to
sell
and
was
entirely
satisfied
with
the
sale
after
it
was
concluded
i
know
of
the
fact
that
about
a
year
and
a
half
previous
she
had
offered
to
sell
out
the
stock
of
the
backus
oil
company
at
from
to
per
cent
less
than
she
received
in
the
sale
referred
to
and
the
value
of
the
works
and
property
sold
had
not
increased
in
the
meantime
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
works
of
the
backus
oil
company
and
their
value
i
could
at
the
time
of
the
sale
have
built
the
works
new
for
there
were
no
threats
nor
intimidations
nor
anything
of
the
kind
used
to
force
the
sale
the
negotiations
were
pleasant
and
fair
and
the
price
paid
in
excess
of
the
value
and
satisfactory
to
backus
and
all
concerned
for
her
so
far
as
i
can
see
after
more
than
years
have
elapsed
there
was
nothing
but
the
most
kindly
and
considerate
treatment
of
backus
on
the
part
of
the
standard
oil
company
i
regret
that
backus
did
not
take
at
least
part
of
her
pay
in
standard
certificates
as
we
suggested
she
should
do
the
question
of
rebates
of
all
the
subjects
which
seem
to
have
attracted
the
attention
of
the
public
to
the
affairs
of
the
standard
oil
company
the
matter
of
rebates
from
railroads
has
perhaps
been
uppermost
the
standard
oil
company
of
ohio
of
which
i
was
president
did
receive
rebates
from
the
railroads
prior
to
but
received
no
advantages
for
which
it
did
not
give
full
compensation
the
reason
for
rebates
was
that
such
was
the
railroads
method
of
business
a
public
rate
was
made
and
collected
by
the
railroad
companies
but
so
far
as
my
knowledge
extends
was
seldom
retained
in
full
a
portion
of
it
was
repaid
to
the
shippers
as
a
rebate
by
this
method
the
real
rate
of
freight
which
any
shipper
paid
was
not
known
by
his
competitors
nor
by
other
railroad
companies
the
amount
being
a
matter
of
bargain
with
the
carrying
company
each
shipper
made
the
best
bargain
that
he
could
but
whether
he
was
doing
better
than
his
competitor
was
only
a
matter
of
conjecture
much
depended
upon
whether
the
shipper
had
the
advantage
of
competition
of
carriers
the
standard
oil
company
of
ohio
being
situated
at
cleveland
had
the
advantage
of
different
carrying
lines
as
well
as
of
water
transportation
in
the
summer
taking
advantage
of
those
facilities
it
made
the
best
bargains
possible
for
its
freights
other
companies
sought
to
do
the
same
the
standard
gave
advantages
to
the
railroads
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
cost
of
transportation
of
freight
it
offered
freights
in
large
quantity
and
it
furnished
loading
facilities
and
discharging
facilities
at
great
cost
it
provided
regular
traffic
so
that
a
railroad
could
conduct
its
transportation
to
the
best
advantage
and
use
its
equipment
to
the
full
extent
of
its
hauling
capacity
without
waiting
for
the
convenience
it
exempted
railroads
from
liability
for
fire
and
carried
its
own
insurance
it
provided
at
its
own
expense
terminal
facilities
which
permitted
economies
in
handling
for
these
services
it
obtained
contracts
for
special
allowances
on
freights
but
notwithstanding
these
special
allowances
this
traffic
from
the
standard
oil
company
was
far
more
profitable
to
the
railroad
companies
than
the
smaller
and
irregular
traffic
which
might
have
paid
a
higher
rate
to
understand
the
situation
which
affected
the
giving
and
taking
of
rebates
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
railroads
were
all
eager
to
enlarge
their
freight
traffic
they
were
competing
with
the
facilities
and
rates
offered
by
the
boats
on
lake
and
canal
and
by
the
all
these
means
of
transporting
oil
cut
into
the
business
of
the
railroads
and
they
were
desperately
anxious
to
successfully
meet
this
competition
as
i
have
stated
we
provided
means
for
loading
and
unloading
cars
expeditiously
agreed
to
furnish
a
regular
fixed
number
of
to
transport
each
day
and
arranged
with
them
for
all
the
other
things
that
i
have
mentioned
the
final
result
being
to
reduce
the
cost
of
transportation
for
both
the
railroads
and
ourselves
all
this
was
following
in
the
natural
laws
of
trade
railroads
the
building
of
the
introduced
another
formidable
competitor
to
the
railroads
but
as
oil
could
be
transported
by
pumping
through
pipes
at
a
much
less
cost
than
by
hauling
in
in
a
railroad
train
the
development
of
the
was
inevitable
the
question
was
simply
whether
the
oil
traffic
was
sufficient
in
volume
to
make
the
investment
profitable
when
had
been
built
to
oil
fields
where
the
wells
had
ceased
to
yield
as
often
happened
they
were
about
the
most
useless
property
imaginable
an
interesting
feature
developed
through
the
relations
which
grew
up
between
the
railroads
and
the
in
many
cases
it
was
necessary
to
combine
the
facilities
of
both
because
the
pipes
reached
only
part
of
the
way
and
from
the
place
where
they
ended
the
railroad
carried
the
oil
to
its
final
destination
in
some
instances
a
railroad
had
formerly
carried
the
oil
the
entire
distance
upon
an
agreed
rate
but
now
that
this
oil
was
partly
pumped
by
and
partly
carried
by
rail
the
freight
payment
was
divided
between
the
two
but
as
a
through
rate
had
been
provided
the
owners
of
the
agreed
to
remit
a
part
of
its
charges
to
the
railroad
so
we
had
cases
where
the
standard
paid
a
rebate
to
the
railroad
instead
of
the
reverse
but
i
do
not
remember
having
heard
any
complaint
of
this
coming
from
the
students
of
these
complicated
subjects
the
profits
of
the
standard
oil
company
did
not
come
from
advantages
given
by
railroads
the
railroads
rather
were
the
ones
who
profited
by
the
traffic
of
the
standard
oil
company
and
whatever
advantage
it
received
in
its
constant
efforts
to
reduce
rates
of
freight
was
only
one
of
the
many
elements
of
lessening
cost
to
the
consumer
which
enabled
us
to
increase
our
volume
of
business
the
world
over
because
we
could
reduce
the
selling
price
how
general
was
the
complicated
bargaining
for
rates
can
hardly
be
imagined
everyone
got
the
best
rate
that
he
could
after
the
passage
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
it
was
learned
that
many
small
companies
which
shipped
limited
quantities
had
received
lower
rates
than
we
had
been
able
to
secure
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
had
made
large
investments
to
provide
for
terminal
facilities
regular
shipments
and
other
economies
i
well
remember
a
bright
man
from
boston
who
had
much
to
say
about
rebates
and
drawbacks
he
was
an
old
and
experienced
merchant
and
looked
after
his
affairs
with
a
cautious
and
watchful
eye
he
feared
that
some
of
his
competitors
were
doing
better
than
he
in
bargaining
for
rates
and
he
delivered
himself
of
this
conviction
i
am
opposed
on
principle
to
the
whole
system
of
rebates
and
drawbacks
unless
i
am
in
it
chapter
v
other
business
experiences
and
business
principles
going
into
the
fields
was
one
of
those
experiences
in
which
one
finds
oneself
rather
against
the
will
for
it
was
not
a
deliberate
plan
of
mine
to
extend
my
cares
and
responsibilities
my
connection
with
iron
ores
came
about
through
some
unfortunate
investments
in
the
northwest
country
these
interests
had
included
a
good
many
different
industries
mines
steel
mills
paper
mills
a
nail
factory
railroads
lumber
fields
smelting
properties
and
other
investments
about
which
i
have
now
forgotten
i
was
a
minority
stockholder
in
all
these
enterprises
and
had
no
part
in
their
management
not
all
of
them
were
profitable
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
a
period
of
years
just
preceding
the
panic
of
values
were
more
or
less
inflated
and
many
people
who
thought
they
were
wealthy
found
that
the
actual
facts
were
quite
different
from
what
they
had
imagined
when
the
hard
experiences
of
that
panic
forced
upon
them
the
unpalatable
truth
most
of
these
properties
i
had
not
even
seen
having
relied
upon
the
investigation
of
others
respecting
their
worth
indeed
it
has
never
been
my
custom
to
rely
alone
upon
my
own
knowledge
of
the
value
of
such
plants
i
have
found
other
people
who
knew
much
better
than
i
how
to
investigate
such
enterprises
even
at
this
time
i
had
been
planning
to
relieve
myself
of
business
cares
and
the
panic
only
caused
me
to
postpone
taking
the
long
holiday
to
which
i
had
been
looking
forward
i
was
fortunate
in
making
the
acquaintance
of
frederick
gates
who
was
then
engaged
in
some
work
in
connection
with
the
american
baptist
education
society
which
required
him
to
travel
extensively
over
the
country
north
south
east
and
west
it
occurred
to
me
that
gates
who
had
a
great
store
of
common
sense
though
no
especial
technical
information
about
factories
and
mills
might
aid
me
in
securing
some
information
as
to
how
these
concerns
were
actually
prospering
once
as
he
was
going
south
i
suggested
that
he
look
over
an
iron
mill
in
which
i
had
some
interest
which
happened
to
be
on
his
route
his
report
was
a
model
of
what
such
a
report
should
be
it
stated
the
facts
and
in
this
case
they
were
almost
all
unfavourable
a
little
later
he
happened
to
be
going
west
and
i
gave
him
the
name
and
address
of
property
in
that
region
in
which
i
held
a
minority
interest
i
felt
quite
sure
that
this
particular
property
was
doing
well
and
it
was
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
me
to
learn
through
his
clear
and
definite
account
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
this
enterprise
too
which
had
been
represented
as
rolling
in
money
would
get
into
trouble
if
things
kept
on
as
they
were
going
nursing
the
commercially
ill
i
then
arranged
with
gates
to
accept
a
position
whereby
he
could
help
me
unravel
these
tangled
affairs
and
become
like
myself
a
man
of
business
but
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
he
should
not
abandon
his
larger
and
more
important
plans
for
working
out
some
philanthropic
aspirations
that
he
had
right
here
i
may
stop
to
give
credit
to
gates
for
possessing
a
combination
of
rare
business
ability
very
highly
developed
and
very
honourably
exercised
overshadowed
by
a
passion
to
accomplish
some
great
and
benefits
to
mankind
the
influence
of
which
will
last
he
is
the
chairman
of
the
general
education
board
and
active
in
many
other
boards
and
for
years
he
has
helped
in
the
various
plans
that
we
have
been
interested
in
where
money
was
given
in
the
hope
that
it
would
do
something
more
than
temporary
service
gates
has
for
many
years
been
closely
associated
with
my
personal
affairs
he
has
been
through
strenuous
times
with
me
and
has
taken
cares
of
many
kinds
off
my
shoulders
leaving
me
more
time
to
play
golf
plan
roads
move
trees
and
follow
other
congenial
occupations
his
efforts
in
the
investigations
in
connection
with
our
educational
contributions
our
medical
research
and
other
kindred
works
have
been
very
successful
during
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
my
son
has
shared
with
gates
the
responsibility
of
this
work
and
more
recently
starr
murphy
has
also
joined
with
us
to
help
gates
who
has
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
and
has
well
earned
some
leisure
which
we
have
wanted
him
to
enjoy
but
to
return
to
the
story
of
our
troubled
investments
gates
went
into
the
study
of
each
of
these
business
concerns
and
did
the
best
he
could
with
them
it
has
been
our
policy
never
to
allow
a
company
in
which
we
had
an
interest
to
be
thrown
into
the
bankruptcy
court
if
we
could
prevent
it
for
receiverships
are
very
costly
in
many
ways
and
often
involve
heavy
sacrifices
of
genuine
values
our
plan
has
been
to
stay
with
the
institution
nurse
it
lend
it
money
when
necessary
improve
facilities
cheapen
production
and
avail
ourselves
of
the
opportunities
which
time
and
patience
are
likely
to
bring
to
make
it
and
successful
so
we
went
carefully
through
the
affairs
of
these
crippled
enterprises
in
the
hard
times
of
and
carrying
many
of
them
for
years
after
sometimes
buying
the
interests
of
others
and
sometimes
selling
our
own
interest
but
all
or
nearly
all
escaped
the
expenses
and
humiliation
of
bankruptcy
receivership
and
foreclosure
before
these
matters
were
entirely
closed
up
we
had
a
vast
amount
of
experience
in
the
doctoring
of
the
commercially
my
only
excuse
for
dwelling
upon
the
subject
at
this
late
day
is
to
point
out
the
fact
to
some
business
men
who
get
discouraged
that
much
can
be
done
by
careful
and
patient
attention
even
when
the
business
is
apparently
in
very
deep
water
it
requires
two
things
some
added
capital
put
in
by
one
self
or
secured
from
others
and
a
strict
adherence
to
the
sound
natural
laws
of
business
the
ore
mines
among
these
investments
were
some
shares
in
a
number
of
ore
mines
and
an
interest
in
the
stocks
and
bonds
of
a
railroad
being
built
to
carry
the
ore
from
the
mines
to
lake
ports
we
had
great
faith
in
these
mines
but
to
work
them
the
railroad
was
necessary
it
had
been
begun
but
in
the
panic
of
it
and
all
other
developments
were
nearly
ruined
although
we
were
minority
holders
of
the
stock
it
seemed
to
be
up
to
us
to
keep
the
enterprise
alive
through
the
harrowing
panic
days
i
had
to
loan
my
personal
securities
to
raise
money
and
finally
we
were
compelled
to
supply
a
great
deal
of
actual
cash
and
to
get
it
we
were
obliged
to
go
into
the
then
greatly
upset
money
market
and
buy
currency
at
a
high
premium
to
ship
west
by
express
to
pay
the
labourers
on
the
railroad
and
to
keep
them
alive
when
the
fright
of
the
panic
period
subsided
and
matters
became
a
little
more
settled
we
began
to
realize
our
situation
we
had
invested
many
millions
and
no
one
wanted
to
go
in
with
us
to
buy
stock
on
the
contrary
everybody
else
seemed
to
want
to
sell
the
stock
was
offered
to
us
in
alarming
quantities
substantially
all
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
companies
came
without
any
solicitation
on
our
part
quite
the
contrary
and
we
paid
for
it
in
cash
we
now
found
ourselves
in
control
of
a
great
amount
of
ore
lands
from
some
of
which
the
ore
could
be
removed
by
a
steam
shovel
for
a
few
cents
a
ton
but
we
still
faced
a
most
imperfect
and
inadequate
method
of
transporting
the
ore
to
market
when
we
realized
that
events
were
shaping
themselves
so
that
to
protect
our
investments
we
should
be
obliged
to
go
into
the
business
of
selling
in
a
large
way
we
felt
that
we
must
not
stop
short
of
doing
the
work
as
effectively
as
possible
and
having
already
put
in
so
much
money
we
bought
all
the
ore
land
that
we
thought
was
good
that
was
offered
to
us
the
railroad
and
the
ships
were
only
a
means
to
an
end
the
ore
lands
were
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
and
we
believed
that
we
could
never
have
too
many
good
mines
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
that
the
great
iron
and
steel
manufacturers
did
not
place
what
seemed
to
be
an
adequate
value
on
these
mines
the
lands
which
contained
a
good
many
of
our
best
ore
mines
could
have
been
purchased
very
cheaply
before
we
became
interested
having
launched
ourselves
into
the
venture
we
decided
to
supply
ore
to
every
one
who
needed
it
by
mining
and
transporting
with
the
newest
and
most
effective
facilities
and
our
profits
we
invested
in
more
ore
lands
gates
became
the
president
of
the
various
companies
which
owned
the
mines
and
the
railroad
to
the
lake
to
transport
the
ores
and
he
started
to
learn
and
develop
the
business
of
ore
mining
and
transportation
he
not
only
proved
to
be
an
apt
scholar
but
he
really
mastered
the
various
complexities
of
the
business
he
did
all
the
work
and
only
consulted
me
when
he
wished
to
yet
i
remember
several
interesting
experiences
connected
with
the
working
out
of
these
problems
building
the
ships
after
this
railroad
problem
was
solved
it
was
apparent
that
we
needed
our
own
ships
to
transport
the
ore
down
the
lakes
we
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
building
ships
for
ore
transportation
and
so
following
out
our
custom
we
went
to
the
man
who
in
our
judgment
had
the
widest
knowledge
of
the
subject
he
was
already
well
known
to
us
but
was
in
the
ore
transportation
business
on
a
large
scale
on
his
own
account
and
of
course
the
moment
we
began
to
ship
ore
we
realized
that
we
would
become
competitors
gates
got
into
communication
with
this
expert
and
came
with
him
one
evening
to
my
house
in
new
york
just
before
dinner
he
said
he
could
stay
only
a
few
minutes
but
i
told
him
that
i
thought
we
could
finish
up
our
affairs
in
ten
minutes
and
we
did
this
is
the
only
time
i
remember
seeing
personally
any
one
on
the
business
of
the
ore
company
all
the
conferences
as
i
said
before
were
carried
on
by
gates
who
seemed
to
enjoy
work
and
he
has
had
abundant
privileges
in
that
direction
we
explained
to
this
gentleman
that
we
were
proposing
to
transport
our
ore
from
these
lake
superior
lands
ourselves
and
that
we
should
like
to
have
him
assume
charge
of
the
construction
of
several
ships
to
be
of
the
largest
and
most
approved
type
for
our
chance
of
success
lay
in
having
boats
which
could
be
operated
with
the
greatest
efficiency
at
that
time
the
largest
ships
carried
about
five
thousand
tons
but
in
when
we
sold
out
we
had
ships
that
carried
seven
thousand
or
eight
thousand
tons
and
now
there
are
some
that
transport
as
much
as
ten
thousand
tons
and
more
this
expert
naturally
replied
that
as
he
was
in
the
trade
himself
he
had
no
desire
to
encourage
us
to
go
into
it
we
explained
to
him
that
as
we
had
made
this
large
investment
it
seemed
to
us
to
be
necessary
for
the
protection
of
our
interests
to
control
our
own
lake
carriers
so
we
had
decided
to
mine
ship
and
market
the
ore
that
we
came
to
him
because
he
could
plan
and
superintend
the
construction
of
the
best
ships
for
us
and
that
we
wanted
to
deal
with
him
for
that
reason
that
notwithstanding
that
he
represented
one
of
the
largest
firms
among
our
competitors
we
knew
that
he
was
honest
and
straightforward
and
that
we
were
most
anxious
to
deal
with
him
employing
a
competitor
he
still
demurred
but
we
tried
to
convince
him
that
we
were
not
to
be
deterred
from
going
into
the
trade
and
that
we
were
willing
to
pay
him
a
satisfactory
commission
for
looking
after
the
building
of
the
ships
somebody
we
explained
was
going
to
do
the
work
for
us
and
he
might
as
well
have
the
profit
as
the
next
man
this
argument
finally
seemed
to
impress
him
and
we
then
and
there
closed
an
agreement
the
details
of
which
were
worked
out
afterward
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
this
gentleman
was
samuel
mather
of
cleveland
he
spent
only
a
few
minutes
in
the
house
during
which
time
we
gave
him
the
order
for
about
worth
of
ships
and
this
was
the
only
time
i
saw
him
but
mather
is
a
man
of
high
business
honour
we
trusted
him
implicitly
although
he
was
a
competitor
and
we
never
had
occasion
to
regret
it
at
that
time
there
were
some
nine
or
ten
shipbuilding
companies
located
at
various
points
on
the
great
lakes
all
were
independent
of
each
other
and
there
was
sharp
competition
between
them
times
were
pretty
hard
with
them
their
business
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
panic
of
they
were
not
able
to
keep
their
works
in
full
operation
it
was
in
the
fall
of
the
year
and
many
of
their
employees
were
facing
a
hard
winter
we
took
this
into
account
in
considering
how
many
ships
we
should
build
and
we
made
up
our
minds
that
we
would
build
all
the
ships
that
could
be
built
and
give
employment
to
the
idle
men
on
the
great
lakes
accordingly
we
instructed
mather
to
write
to
each
firm
of
shipbuilders
and
ascertain
how
many
ships
they
could
build
and
put
in
readiness
for
operation
at
the
opening
of
navigation
the
next
spring
he
found
that
some
companies
could
build
one
some
could
build
two
and
that
the
total
number
would
be
twelve
accordingly
we
asked
him
to
have
constructed
twelve
ships
all
of
steel
all
of
the
largest
capacity
then
understood
to
be
practicable
on
the
great
lakes
some
of
them
were
to
be
steamships
and
some
consorts
for
towing
but
all
were
to
be
built
on
substantially
the
same
general
pattern
which
was
to
represent
the
best
ideals
then
prevalent
for
ships
in
giving
such
an
order
he
was
exposed
of
course
to
the
risk
of
paying
very
high
prices
this
would
have
been
certain
if
mather
had
announced
in
advance
that
he
was
prepared
to
build
twelve
ships
and
asked
bids
on
them
just
how
he
managed
it
i
was
not
told
until
long
after
and
though
it
is
now
an
old
story
of
the
lakes
i
repeat
it
as
it
may
be
new
to
many
mather
kept
the
secret
of
the
number
of
ships
he
wished
to
construct
absolutely
to
himself
he
sent
his
plans
and
specifications
each
substantially
a
duplicate
of
the
others
to
each
of
the
firms
and
asked
each
firm
to
bid
on
one
or
two
ships
as
the
case
might
be
all
naturally
supposed
that
at
most
only
two
ships
were
to
be
built
and
each
was
extremely
eager
to
get
the
work
or
at
least
one
of
the
two
vessels
on
the
day
before
the
contracts
were
to
be
let
all
the
bidders
were
in
cleveland
on
the
invitation
of
mather
one
by
one
they
were
taken
into
his
private
office
for
special
conference
covering
all
the
details
preparatory
to
the
final
bid
at
the
appointed
hour
the
bids
were
in
deep
was
the
interest
on
the
part
of
all
the
gentlemen
as
to
who
would
be
the
lucky
one
to
draw
the
prize
mather
manner
had
convinced
each
that
somehow
he
himself
must
be
the
favoured
bidder
yet
when
he
came
to
meet
his
competitors
in
the
hotel
lobby
the
beams
of
satisfaction
which
plainly
emanated
from
their
faces
also
compelled
many
heart
searchings
at
last
the
crucial
hour
came
and
at
about
the
same
moment
each
gentleman
received
a
little
note
from
mather
conveying
to
him
the
tidings
that
to
him
had
been
awarded
a
contract
sufficient
to
supply
his
works
to
their
utmost
capacity
they
all
rushed
with
a
common
impulse
to
the
hotel
lobby
where
they
had
been
accustomed
to
meet
each
bent
on
displaying
his
note
and
commiserating
his
unsuccessful
rivals
only
to
discover
that
each
had
a
contract
for
all
he
could
do
and
that
each
had
been
actually
bidding
against
nobody
but
himself
great
was
the
hilarity
which
covered
their
chagrin
when
they
met
and
compared
notes
and
looked
into
each
others
faces
however
all
were
happy
and
satisfied
but
it
may
be
said
in
passing
that
these
amiable
gentlemen
all
united
subsequently
in
one
company
which
has
had
a
highly
satisfactory
career
and
that
we
paid
a
more
uniform
price
for
our
subsequent
purchases
of
ships
after
the
combination
had
been
made
a
landsman
for
ship
manager
with
these
ships
ordered
we
were
fairly
at
the
beginning
of
the
ore
enterprise
but
we
realized
that
we
had
to
make
some
arrangement
to
operate
the
ships
and
we
again
turned
to
our
competitor
mather
in
the
hope
that
he
would
add
this
to
his
cares
unfortunately
because
of
his
obligations
to
others
he
felt
that
this
was
impractical
i
asked
gates
one
day
soon
after
this
how
are
we
to
get
some
one
to
run
these
big
ships
we
have
ordered
do
you
know
of
any
experienced
firm
no
said
gates
i
do
not
know
of
any
firm
to
suggest
at
the
moment
but
why
not
run
them
ourselves
you
do
know
anything
about
ships
do
you
no
he
admitted
but
i
have
in
mind
a
man
who
i
believe
could
do
it
although
when
i
tell
you
about
him
i
fear
you
will
think
that
his
qualifications
are
not
the
best
however
he
has
the
essentials
he
lives
up
the
state
and
never
was
on
a
ship
in
his
life
he
probably
would
know
the
bow
from
the
stern
or
a
from
an
umbrella
but
he
has
good
sense
he
is
honest
enterprising
keen
and
thrifty
he
has
the
art
of
quickly
mastering
a
subject
even
though
it
be
new
to
him
and
difficult
we
still
have
some
months
before
the
ships
will
be
completed
and
if
we
put
him
to
work
now
he
will
be
ready
to
run
the
ships
as
soon
as
they
are
ready
to
be
run
all
right
i
said
let
give
him
the
job
and
we
did
that
man
was
bowers
he
came
from
broome
county
new
york
bowers
went
from
point
to
point
on
the
lakes
where
the
boats
were
building
and
studied
them
minutely
he
was
quickly
able
to
make
valuable
suggestions
about
their
construction
which
were
approved
and
adopted
by
the
designers
when
the
vessels
were
finished
he
took
charge
of
them
from
the
moment
they
floated
and
he
managed
these
and
the
dozens
which
followed
with
a
skill
and
ability
that
commanded
the
admiration
of
all
the
sailors
on
the
lakes
he
even
invented
an
anchor
which
he
used
with
our
fleet
and
later
it
was
adopted
by
other
vessels
and
i
have
heard
that
it
is
used
in
the
united
states
navy
he
remained
in
his
position
until
we
sold
out
we
have
given
bowers
all
sorts
of
hard
tasks
since
we
retired
from
the
lake
traffic
and
have
found
him
always
successful
lately
the
health
of
a
member
of
his
family
has
made
it
desirable
for
him
to
live
in
colorado
and
he
is
now
the
vigorous
and
efficient
of
the
colorado
fuel
and
iron
company
the
great
ships
and
the
railroad
put
us
in
possession
of
the
most
favourable
facilities
from
the
first
the
organization
was
successful
we
built
up
a
huge
trade
mining
and
carrying
ore
to
cleveland
and
other
lake
ports
we
kept
on
building
and
developing
until
finally
the
fleet
grew
until
it
included
large
steel
vessels
this
enterprise
in
common
with
many
other
important
business
undertakings
in
which
i
was
interested
required
very
little
of
my
personal
attention
owing
to
my
good
fortune
in
having
active
competent
and
thoroughly
reliable
representatives
who
assumed
so
largely
the
responsibilities
of
administration
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
state
that
the
confidence
which
i
have
freely
given
to
business
men
with
whom
i
have
been
associated
has
been
so
fully
justified
selling
to
the
steel
company
the
work
went
on
uninterruptedly
and
prosperously
until
the
formation
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
a
representative
of
this
corporation
came
to
see
us
about
selling
the
land
the
ore
and
the
fleet
of
ships
the
business
was
going
on
smoothly
and
we
had
no
pressing
need
to
sell
but
as
the
organizer
of
the
new
company
felt
that
our
mines
and
railroads
and
ships
were
a
necessary
part
of
the
scheme
we
told
him
we
would
be
pleased
to
facilitate
the
completion
of
the
great
undertaking
they
had
i
think
already
closed
with
carnegie
for
his
various
properties
after
some
negotiation
they
made
an
offer
which
we
accepted
whereby
the
whole
plant
mines
ships
railway
should
become
a
part
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
the
price
paid
was
we
felt
very
moderate
considering
the
present
and
prospective
value
of
the
property
this
transaction
bids
fair
to
show
a
great
profit
to
the
steel
company
for
many
years
and
as
our
payment
was
largely
in
the
securities
of
the
company
we
had
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
prosperity
and
so
after
a
period
of
about
seven
years
i
went
out
of
all
association
with
the
mining
the
transporting
and
the
selling
of
iron
ore
follow
the
laws
of
trade
going
over
again
in
my
mind
the
events
connected
with
this
ore
experience
that
grew
out
of
investments
that
seemed
at
the
time
to
say
the
least
rather
unpromising
i
am
impressed
anew
with
the
importance
of
a
principle
i
have
often
referred
to
if
i
can
make
this
point
clear
to
the
young
man
who
has
had
the
patience
to
follow
these
reminiscences
so
far
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
and
i
hope
it
may
be
a
benefit
to
him
the
underlying
essential
element
of
success
in
business
affairs
is
to
follow
the
established
laws
of
dealing
keep
to
broad
and
sure
lines
and
study
them
to
be
certain
that
they
are
correct
ones
watch
the
natural
operations
of
trade
and
keep
within
them
even
think
of
temporary
or
sharp
advantages
do
waste
your
effort
on
a
thing
which
ends
in
a
petty
triumph
unless
you
are
satisfied
with
a
life
of
petty
success
be
sure
that
before
you
go
into
an
enterprise
you
see
your
way
clear
to
stay
through
to
a
successful
end
look
ahead
it
is
surprising
how
many
bright
business
men
go
into
important
undertakings
with
little
or
no
study
of
the
controlling
conditions
they
risk
their
all
upon
study
diligently
your
capital
requirements
and
fortify
yourself
fully
to
cover
possible
because
you
can
absolutely
count
on
meeting
be
sure
that
you
are
not
deceiving
yourself
at
any
time
about
actual
conditions
the
man
who
starts
out
simply
with
the
idea
of
getting
rich
wo
succeed
you
must
have
a
larger
ambition
there
is
no
mystery
in
business
success
the
great
industrial
leaders
have
told
again
and
again
the
plain
and
obvious
fact
that
there
can
be
no
permanent
success
without
fair
dealing
that
leads
to
confidence
in
the
man
himself
and
that
is
the
real
capital
we
all
prize
and
work
for
if
you
do
each
day
task
successfully
and
stay
faithfully
within
these
natural
operations
of
commercial
laws
which
i
talk
so
much
about
and
keep
your
head
clear
you
will
come
out
all
right
and
will
then
perhaps
forgive
me
for
moralizing
in
this
way
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
caution
a
young
man
who
reads
so
sober
a
book
as
this
not
to
lose
his
head
over
a
little
success
or
to
grow
impatient
or
discouraged
by
a
little
failure
panic
experiences
i
had
desired
to
retire
from
business
in
the
early
nineties
having
begun
work
so
young
i
felt
that
at
fifty
it
was
due
me
to
have
freedom
from
absorption
in
active
business
affairs
and
to
devote
myself
to
a
variety
of
interests
other
than
money
making
which
had
claimed
a
portion
of
my
time
since
the
beginning
of
my
business
career
but
were
years
of
ominous
outlook
in
the
storm
broke
and
i
had
many
investments
to
care
for
as
i
have
already
related
this
year
and
the
next
was
a
trying
period
of
grave
anxiety
to
everyone
no
one
could
retire
from
work
at
such
a
time
in
the
standard
we
continued
to
make
progress
even
through
all
these
panic
years
as
we
had
large
reserves
of
cash
on
account
of
our
very
conservative
methods
of
financing
in
or
i
was
able
to
carry
out
my
plans
to
be
relieved
from
any
association
with
the
actual
management
of
the
company
affairs
from
that
time
as
i
have
said
i
have
had
little
or
no
part
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
since
i
can
remember
all
the
great
panics
but
i
believe
the
panic
of
was
the
most
trying
no
one
escaped
from
it
great
or
small
important
institutions
had
to
be
supported
and
carried
through
the
time
of
distrust
and
unreasoning
fear
to
morgan
real
and
effective
help
i
should
join
with
other
business
men
and
give
great
praise
his
commanding
personality
served
a
most
valuable
end
he
acted
quickly
and
resolutely
when
quickness
and
decision
were
the
things
most
needed
to
regain
confidence
and
he
was
efficiently
seconded
by
many
able
and
leading
financiers
of
the
country
who
coöperated
courageously
and
effectively
to
restore
confidence
and
prosperity
the
question
has
been
asked
if
i
think
we
shall
revive
quickly
from
the
panic
of
october
i
hesitate
to
speak
on
the
subject
since
i
am
not
a
prophet
nor
the
son
of
a
prophet
but
as
to
the
ultimate
outcome
there
is
of
course
no
doubt
this
temporary
will
lead
to
safer
institutions
and
more
conservative
management
upon
the
part
of
everyone
and
this
is
a
quality
we
need
it
will
not
long
depress
our
wonderful
spirit
of
initiative
the
country
resources
have
not
been
cut
down
nor
injured
by
financial
distrust
a
gradual
recovery
will
only
tend
to
make
the
future
all
the
more
secure
and
patience
is
a
virtue
in
business
affairs
as
in
other
things
here
again
i
would
venture
to
utter
a
word
of
caution
to
business
men
let
them
study
their
own
affairs
frankly
and
face
the
truth
if
their
methods
are
extravagant
let
them
realize
the
facts
and
act
accordingly
one
can
not
successfully
go
against
natural
tendencies
and
it
is
folly
to
fail
to
recognize
them
it
is
not
easy
for
so
impressionable
and
imaginative
a
people
as
we
americans
are
to
come
down
to
plain
hard
facts
yet
we
are
doing
it
without
loss
of
or
prestige
throughout
the
world
chapter
vi
the
difficult
art
of
giving
it
is
no
doubt
easy
to
write
platitudes
and
generalities
about
the
joys
of
giving
and
the
duty
that
one
owes
to
one
fellow
men
and
to
put
together
again
all
the
familiar
phrases
that
have
served
for
generations
whenever
the
subject
has
been
taken
up
i
can
hardly
hope
to
succeed
in
starting
any
new
interest
in
this
great
subject
when
gifted
writers
have
so
often
failed
yet
i
confess
i
find
much
more
interest
in
it
at
this
time
than
in
rambling
on
as
i
have
been
doing
about
the
affairs
of
business
and
trade
it
is
most
difficult
however
to
dwell
upon
a
very
practical
and
side
of
benefactions
generally
without
seeming
to
ignore
or
at
least
to
fail
to
appreciate
fully
the
spirit
of
giving
which
has
its
source
in
the
heart
and
which
of
course
makes
it
all
worth
while
in
this
country
we
have
come
to
the
period
when
we
can
well
afford
to
ask
the
ablest
men
to
devote
more
of
their
time
thought
and
money
to
the
public
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
attempt
to
define
exactly
what
this
betterment
work
should
consist
of
every
man
will
do
that
for
himself
and
his
own
conclusion
will
be
final
for
himself
it
is
well
i
think
that
no
narrow
or
preconceived
plan
should
be
set
down
as
the
best
i
am
sure
it
is
a
mistake
to
assume
that
the
possession
of
money
in
great
abundance
necessarily
brings
happiness
the
very
rich
are
just
like
all
the
rest
of
us
and
if
they
get
pleasure
from
the
possession
of
money
it
comes
from
their
ability
to
do
things
which
give
satisfaction
to
someone
besides
themselves
limitations
of
the
rich
the
mere
expenditure
of
money
for
things
so
i
am
told
by
those
who
profess
to
know
soon
palls
upon
one
the
novelty
of
being
able
to
purchase
anything
one
wants
soon
passes
because
what
people
most
seek
can
not
be
bought
with
money
these
rich
men
we
read
about
in
the
newspapers
can
not
get
personal
returns
beyond
a
limit
for
their
expenditure
they
can
not
gratify
the
pleasures
of
the
palate
beyond
very
moderate
bounds
since
they
can
not
purchase
a
good
digestion
they
can
not
lavish
very
much
money
on
fine
raiment
for
themselves
or
their
families
without
suffering
from
public
ridicule
and
in
their
homes
they
can
not
go
much
beyond
the
comforts
of
the
less
wealthy
without
involving
them
in
more
pain
than
pleasure
as
i
study
wealthy
men
i
can
see
but
one
way
in
which
they
can
secure
a
real
equivalent
for
money
spent
and
that
is
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
giving
where
the
money
may
produce
an
effect
which
will
be
a
lasting
gratification
a
man
of
business
may
often
most
properly
consider
that
he
does
his
share
in
building
up
a
property
which
gives
steady
work
for
few
or
many
people
and
his
contribution
consists
in
giving
to
his
employees
good
working
conditions
new
opportunities
and
a
strong
stimulus
to
good
work
just
so
long
as
he
has
the
welfare
of
his
employees
in
his
mind
and
follows
his
convictions
no
one
can
help
honouring
such
a
man
it
would
be
the
narrowest
sort
of
view
to
take
and
i
think
the
meanest
to
consider
that
good
works
consist
chiefly
in
the
outright
giving
of
money
the
best
philanthropy
the
best
philanthropy
the
help
that
does
the
most
good
and
the
least
harm
the
help
that
nourishes
civilization
at
its
very
root
that
most
widely
disseminates
health
righteousness
and
happiness
is
not
what
is
usually
called
charity
it
is
in
my
judgment
the
investment
of
effort
or
time
or
money
carefully
considered
with
relation
to
the
power
of
employing
people
at
a
remunerative
wage
to
expand
and
develop
the
resources
at
hand
and
to
give
opportunity
for
progress
and
healthful
labour
where
it
did
not
exist
before
no
mere
is
comparable
to
this
in
its
lasting
and
beneficial
results
if
as
i
am
accustomed
to
think
this
statement
is
a
correct
one
how
vast
indeed
is
the
philanthropic
field
it
may
be
urged
that
the
daily
vocation
of
life
is
one
thing
and
the
work
of
philanthropy
quite
another
i
have
no
sympathy
with
this
notion
the
man
who
plans
to
do
all
his
giving
on
sunday
is
a
poor
prop
for
the
institutions
of
the
country
the
excuse
for
referring
so
often
to
the
busy
man
of
affairs
is
that
his
help
is
most
needed
i
know
of
men
who
have
followed
out
this
large
plan
of
developing
work
not
as
a
temporary
matter
but
as
a
permanent
principle
these
men
have
taken
up
doubtful
enterprises
and
carried
them
through
to
success
often
at
great
risk
and
in
the
face
of
great
scepticism
not
as
a
matter
only
of
personal
profit
but
in
the
larger
spirit
of
general
uplift
disinterested
service
the
road
to
success
if
i
were
to
give
advice
to
a
young
man
starting
out
in
life
i
should
say
to
him
if
you
aim
for
a
large
success
do
not
begin
your
business
career
whether
you
sell
your
labour
or
are
an
independent
producer
with
the
idea
of
getting
from
the
world
by
hook
or
crook
all
you
can
in
the
choice
of
your
profession
or
your
business
employment
let
your
first
thought
be
where
can
i
fit
in
so
that
i
may
be
most
effective
in
the
work
of
the
world
where
can
i
lend
a
hand
in
a
way
most
effectively
to
advance
the
general
interests
enter
life
in
such
a
spirit
choose
your
vocation
in
that
way
and
you
have
taken
the
first
step
on
the
highest
road
to
a
large
success
investigation
will
show
that
the
great
fortunes
which
have
been
made
in
this
country
and
the
same
is
probably
true
of
other
lands
have
come
to
men
who
have
performed
great
and
economic
services
men
who
with
great
faith
in
the
future
of
their
country
have
done
most
for
the
development
of
its
resources
the
man
will
be
most
successful
who
confers
the
greatest
service
on
the
world
commercial
enterprises
that
are
needed
by
the
public
will
pay
commercial
enterprises
that
are
not
needed
fail
and
ought
to
fail
on
the
other
hand
the
one
thing
which
such
a
business
philosopher
would
be
most
careful
to
avoid
in
his
investments
of
time
and
effort
or
money
is
the
unnecessary
duplication
of
existing
industries
he
would
regard
all
money
spent
in
increasing
needless
competition
as
wasted
and
worse
the
man
who
puts
up
a
second
factory
when
the
factory
in
existence
will
supply
the
public
demand
adequately
and
cheaply
is
wasting
the
national
wealth
and
destroying
the
national
prosperity
taking
the
bread
from
the
labourer
and
unnecessarily
introducing
heartache
and
misery
into
the
world
probably
the
greatest
single
obstacle
to
the
progress
and
happiness
of
the
american
people
lies
in
the
willingness
of
so
many
men
to
invest
their
time
and
money
in
multiplying
competitive
industries
instead
of
opening
up
new
fields
and
putting
their
money
into
lines
of
industry
and
development
that
are
needed
it
requires
a
better
type
of
mind
to
seek
out
and
to
support
or
to
create
the
new
than
to
follow
the
worn
paths
of
accepted
success
but
here
is
the
great
chance
in
our
still
rapidly
developing
country
the
penalty
of
a
selfish
attempt
to
make
the
world
confer
a
living
without
contributing
to
the
progress
or
happiness
of
mankind
is
generally
a
failure
to
the
individual
the
pity
is
that
when
he
goes
down
he
inflicts
heartache
and
misery
also
on
others
who
are
in
no
way
responsible
the
generosity
of
service
probably
the
most
generous
people
in
the
world
are
the
very
poor
who
assume
each
other
burdens
in
the
crises
which
come
so
often
to
the
hard
pressed
the
mother
in
the
tenement
falls
ill
and
the
neighbour
in
the
next
room
assumes
her
burdens
the
father
loses
his
work
and
neighbours
supply
food
to
his
children
from
their
own
scanty
store
how
often
one
hears
of
cases
where
the
orphans
are
taken
over
and
brought
up
by
the
poor
friend
whose
benefaction
means
great
additional
hardship
this
sort
of
genuine
service
makes
the
most
princely
gift
from
superabundance
look
insignificant
indeed
the
jews
have
had
for
centuries
a
precept
that
of
a
man
possessions
must
be
devoted
to
good
works
but
even
this
measure
of
giving
is
but
a
rough
yardstick
to
go
by
to
give
a
tenth
of
one
income
is
wellnigh
an
impossibility
to
some
while
to
others
it
means
a
miserable
pittance
if
the
spirit
is
there
the
matter
of
proportion
is
soon
lost
sight
of
it
is
only
the
spirit
of
giving
that
counts
and
the
very
poor
give
without
any
but
i
fear
that
i
am
dealing
with
generalities
again
the
education
of
children
in
my
early
days
may
have
been
straightlaced
yet
i
have
always
been
thankful
that
the
custom
was
quite
general
to
teach
young
people
to
give
systematically
of
money
that
they
themselves
had
earned
it
is
a
good
thing
to
lead
children
to
realize
early
the
importance
of
their
obligations
to
others
but
i
confess
it
is
increasingly
difficult
for
what
were
luxuries
then
have
become
commonplaces
now
it
should
be
a
greater
pleasure
and
satisfaction
to
give
money
for
a
good
cause
than
to
earn
it
and
i
have
always
indulged
the
hope
that
during
my
life
i
should
be
able
to
help
establish
efficiency
in
giving
so
that
wealth
may
be
of
greater
use
to
the
present
and
future
generations
perhaps
just
here
lies
the
difference
between
the
gifts
of
money
and
of
service
the
poor
meet
promptly
the
misfortunes
which
confront
the
home
circle
and
household
of
the
neighbour
the
giver
of
money
if
his
contribution
is
to
be
valuable
must
add
service
in
the
way
of
study
and
he
must
help
to
attack
and
improve
underlying
conditions
not
being
so
pressed
by
the
racking
necessities
it
is
he
that
should
be
better
able
to
attack
the
subject
from
a
more
scientific
standpoint
but
the
final
analysis
is
the
same
his
money
is
a
feeble
offering
without
the
study
behind
it
which
will
make
its
expenditure
effective
great
hospitals
conducted
by
noble
and
unselfish
men
and
women
are
doing
wonderful
work
but
no
less
important
are
the
achievements
in
research
that
reveal
hitherto
unknown
facts
about
diseases
and
provide
the
remedies
by
which
many
of
them
can
be
relieved
or
even
stamped
out
to
help
the
sick
and
distressed
appeals
to
the
always
but
to
help
the
investigator
who
is
striving
successfully
to
attack
the
causes
which
bring
about
sickness
and
distress
does
not
so
strongly
attract
the
giver
of
money
the
first
appeals
to
the
sentiments
overpoweringly
but
the
second
has
the
head
to
deal
with
yet
i
am
sure
we
are
making
wonderful
advances
in
this
field
of
scientific
giving
all
over
the
world
the
need
of
dealing
with
the
questions
of
philanthropy
with
something
beyond
the
impulses
of
emotion
is
evident
and
everywhere
help
is
being
given
to
those
heroic
men
and
women
who
are
devoting
themselves
to
the
practical
and
essentially
scientific
tasks
it
is
a
good
and
inspiring
thing
to
recall
occasionally
the
heroism
for
example
of
the
men
who
risked
and
sacrificed
their
lives
to
discover
the
facts
about
yellow
fever
a
sacrifice
for
which
untold
generations
will
bless
them
and
this
same
spirit
has
animated
the
professions
of
medicine
and
surgery
scientific
research
how
far
may
this
spirit
of
sacrifice
properly
extend
a
great
number
of
scientific
men
every
year
give
up
everything
to
arrive
at
some
helpful
contribution
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
good
people
who
lightly
and
freely
criticize
their
actions
scarcely
realize
just
what
such
criticism
means
it
is
one
thing
to
stand
on
the
comfortable
ground
of
placid
inaction
and
put
forth
words
of
cynical
wisdom
and
another
to
plunge
into
the
work
itself
and
through
strenuous
experience
earn
the
right
to
express
strong
conclusions
for
my
own
part
i
have
stood
so
much
as
a
placid
onlooker
that
i
have
not
had
the
hardihood
even
to
suggest
how
people
so
much
more
experienced
and
wise
in
those
things
than
i
should
work
out
the
details
even
of
those
plans
with
which
i
have
had
the
honour
to
be
associated
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
criticism
no
doubt
sincere
of
experiments
on
living
dumb
animals
and
the
person
who
stands
for
the
defenceless
animal
has
such
an
overwhelming
appeal
to
the
emotions
that
it
is
perhaps
useless
to
allude
to
the
other
side
of
the
controversy
simon
flexner
of
the
institute
for
medical
research
has
had
to
face
exaggerated
and
even
sensational
reports
which
have
no
basis
of
truth
whatever
but
consider
for
a
moment
what
has
been
accomplished
recently
under
the
direction
of
flexner
in
discovering
a
remedy
for
epidemic
meningitis
it
is
true
that
in
discovering
this
cure
the
lives
of
perhaps
fifteen
animals
were
sacrificed
as
i
learn
most
of
them
monkeys
but
for
each
one
of
these
animals
which
lost
its
life
already
scores
of
human
lives
have
been
saved
men
like
flexner
and
his
associates
do
not
permit
unnecessary
pain
to
defenceless
animals
i
have
been
deeply
interested
in
the
story
of
a
desperate
experiment
to
save
a
child
life
told
in
a
letter
written
by
one
of
my
associates
soon
after
the
event
described
and
it
seems
worthy
of
repeating
alexis
carrel
has
been
associated
with
flexner
and
his
work
and
his
wonderful
skill
has
been
the
result
of
his
experiments
and
experiences
a
wonderful
surgical
operation
alexis
carrel
one
of
the
institute
staff
has
been
making
some
interesting
studies
in
experimental
surgery
and
has
successfully
transplanted
organs
from
one
animal
to
another
and
blood
vessels
from
one
species
to
another
he
had
the
opportunity
recently
of
applying
the
skill
thus
acquired
to
the
saving
of
a
human
life
under
circumstances
which
attracted
great
interest
among
the
medical
fraternity
of
this
city
one
of
the
best
known
of
the
younger
surgeons
in
new
york
had
a
child
born
early
last
march
which
developed
a
disease
in
which
the
blood
for
some
reason
exudes
from
the
blood
vessels
into
the
tissues
of
the
body
and
ordinarily
the
child
dies
of
this
internal
hemorrhage
when
this
child
was
five
days
old
it
was
evident
that
it
was
dying
the
father
and
his
brother
who
is
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
the
profession
and
one
or
two
other
doctors
were
in
consultation
with
reference
to
it
but
considered
the
case
entirely
hopeless
it
so
happened
that
the
father
had
been
impressed
with
the
work
which
carrel
had
been
doing
at
the
institute
and
had
spent
several
days
with
him
studying
his
methods
he
became
convinced
that
the
only
possibility
of
saving
the
child
life
was
by
the
direct
transfusion
of
blood
while
this
has
been
done
between
adults
the
blood
vessels
of
a
young
infant
are
so
delicate
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
operation
could
be
successfully
carried
on
it
is
necessary
not
only
that
the
blood
vessels
of
the
two
persons
should
be
united
together
but
it
must
be
done
in
such
a
way
that
the
interior
lining
of
the
vessels
which
is
a
smooth
shiny
tissue
should
be
continuous
if
the
blood
comes
in
contact
with
the
muscular
coat
of
the
blood
vessels
it
will
clot
and
stop
the
circulation
fortunately
carrel
had
been
experimenting
on
the
blood
vessels
of
some
very
young
animals
and
the
father
was
convinced
that
if
any
man
in
the
country
could
perform
the
operation
successfully
it
would
be
he
it
was
then
the
middle
of
the
night
but
carrel
was
called
on
and
when
the
situation
was
explained
to
him
and
it
was
made
clear
that
the
child
would
die
anyhow
he
readily
consented
to
attempt
the
operation
although
expressing
very
slight
hope
of
its
successful
outcome
the
father
offered
himself
as
the
person
whose
blood
should
be
furnished
to
the
child
it
was
impossible
to
give
anæsthetics
to
either
of
them
in
a
child
of
that
age
there
is
only
one
vein
large
enough
to
be
used
and
that
is
in
the
back
of
the
leg
and
deep
seated
a
prominent
surgeon
who
was
present
exposed
this
vein
he
said
afterward
that
there
was
no
sign
of
life
in
the
child
and
expressed
the
belief
that
the
child
had
been
to
all
intents
and
purposes
dead
for
ten
minutes
in
view
of
its
condition
he
raised
the
question
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
proceed
further
with
the
attempt
the
father
however
insisted
upon
going
on
and
the
surgeon
then
exposed
the
radial
artery
in
the
surgeon
wrist
and
was
obliged
to
dissect
it
back
about
six
inches
in
order
to
pull
it
out
far
enough
to
make
the
connection
with
the
child
vein
this
part
of
the
work
the
surgeon
who
did
it
afterward
described
as
the
part
of
the
job
he
said
that
the
child
vein
was
about
the
size
of
a
match
and
the
consistency
of
wet
cigarette
paper
and
it
seemed
utterly
impossible
for
anyone
to
successfully
unite
these
two
vessels
carrel
however
accomplished
this
feat
and
then
occurred
what
the
doctors
who
were
present
described
as
one
of
the
most
dramatic
incidents
in
the
history
of
surgery
the
blood
from
the
father
artery
was
released
and
began
to
flow
into
the
child
body
amounting
to
about
a
pint
the
first
sign
of
life
was
a
little
pink
tinge
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
ears
then
the
lips
which
had
become
perfectly
blue
began
to
change
to
red
and
then
suddenly
as
though
the
child
had
been
taken
from
a
hot
mustard
bath
a
pink
glow
broke
out
all
over
its
body
and
it
began
to
cry
lustily
after
about
eight
minutes
the
two
were
separated
the
child
at
that
time
was
crying
for
food
it
was
fed
and
from
that
moment
began
to
eat
and
sleep
regularly
and
made
a
complete
recovery
the
father
appeared
before
a
legislative
committee
at
albany
in
opposition
to
certain
bills
which
were
pending
at
the
last
session
to
restrict
animal
experimentation
and
told
this
incident
and
said
at
the
close
that
when
he
saw
carrel
experiments
he
had
no
idea
that
they
would
so
soon
be
available
for
saving
human
life
much
less
did
he
imagine
that
the
life
to
be
saved
would
be
that
of
his
own
child
the
fundamental
thing
in
all
help
if
the
people
can
be
educated
to
help
themselves
we
strike
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
evils
of
the
world
this
is
the
fundamental
thing
and
it
is
worth
saying
even
if
it
has
been
said
so
often
that
its
truth
is
lost
sight
of
in
its
constant
repetition
the
only
thing
which
is
of
lasting
benefit
to
a
man
is
that
which
he
does
for
himself
money
which
comes
to
him
without
effort
on
his
part
is
seldom
a
benefit
and
often
a
curse
that
is
the
principal
objection
to
speculation
it
is
not
because
more
lose
than
gain
though
that
is
true
but
it
is
because
those
who
gain
are
apt
to
receive
more
injury
from
their
success
than
they
would
have
received
from
failure
and
so
with
regard
to
money
or
other
things
which
are
given
by
one
person
to
another
it
is
only
in
the
exceptional
case
that
the
receiver
is
really
benefited
but
if
we
can
help
people
to
help
themselves
then
there
is
a
permanent
blessing
conferred
men
who
are
studying
the
problem
of
disease
tell
us
that
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
evident
that
the
forces
which
conquer
sickness
are
within
the
body
itself
and
that
it
is
only
when
these
are
reduced
below
the
normal
that
disease
can
get
a
foothold
the
way
to
ward
off
disease
therefore
is
to
tone
up
the
body
generally
and
when
disease
has
secured
a
foothold
the
way
to
combat
it
is
to
help
these
natural
resisting
agencies
which
are
in
the
body
already
in
the
same
way
the
failures
which
a
man
makes
in
his
life
are
due
almost
always
to
some
defect
in
his
personality
some
weakness
of
body
or
mind
or
character
will
or
temperament
the
only
way
to
overcome
these
failings
is
to
build
up
his
personality
from
within
so
that
he
by
virtue
of
what
is
within
him
may
overcome
the
weakness
which
was
the
cause
of
the
failure
it
is
only
those
efforts
the
man
himself
puts
forth
that
can
really
help
him
we
all
desire
to
see
the
widest
possible
distribution
of
the
blessings
of
life
many
crude
plans
have
been
suggested
some
of
which
utterly
ignore
the
essential
facts
of
human
nature
and
if
carried
out
would
perhaps
drag
our
whole
civilization
down
into
hopeless
misery
it
is
my
belief
that
the
principal
cause
for
the
economic
differences
between
people
is
their
difference
in
personality
and
that
it
is
only
as
we
can
assist
in
the
wider
distribution
of
those
qualities
which
go
to
make
up
a
strong
personality
that
we
can
assist
in
the
wider
distribution
of
wealth
under
normal
conditions
the
man
who
is
strong
in
body
in
mind
in
character
and
in
will
need
never
suffer
want
but
these
qualities
can
never
be
developed
in
a
man
unless
by
his
own
efforts
and
the
most
that
any
other
can
do
for
him
is
as
i
have
said
to
help
him
to
help
himself
we
must
always
remember
that
there
is
not
enough
money
for
the
work
of
human
uplift
and
that
there
never
can
be
how
vitally
important
it
is
therefore
that
the
expenditure
should
go
as
far
as
possible
and
be
used
with
the
greatest
intelligence
i
have
been
frank
to
say
that
i
believe
in
the
spirit
of
combination
and
coöperation
when
properly
and
fairly
conducted
in
the
world
of
commercial
affairs
on
the
principle
that
it
helps
to
reduce
waste
and
waste
is
a
dissipation
of
power
i
sincerely
hope
and
thoroughly
believe
that
this
same
principle
will
eventually
prevail
in
the
art
of
giving
as
it
does
in
business
it
is
not
merely
the
tendency
of
the
times
developed
by
more
exacting
conditions
in
industry
but
it
should
make
its
most
effective
appeal
to
the
hearts
of
the
people
who
are
striving
to
do
the
most
good
to
the
largest
number
some
underlying
principles
at
the
risk
of
making
this
chapter
very
dull
and
i
am
told
that
this
is
a
fault
which
inexperienced
authors
should
avoid
at
all
hazards
i
may
perhaps
be
pardoned
if
i
set
down
here
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
which
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
all
my
own
plans
i
have
undertaken
no
work
of
any
importance
for
many
years
which
in
a
general
way
has
not
followed
out
these
broad
lines
and
i
believe
no
really
constructive
effort
can
be
made
in
philanthropic
work
without
such
a
and
consecutive
purpose
my
own
conversion
to
the
feeling
that
an
organized
plan
was
an
absolute
necessity
came
about
in
this
way
about
the
year
i
was
still
following
the
haphazard
fashion
of
giving
here
and
there
as
appeals
presented
themselves
i
investigated
as
i
could
and
worked
myself
almost
to
a
nervous
in
groping
my
way
without
sufficient
guide
or
chart
through
this
field
of
philanthropic
endeavour
there
was
then
forced
upon
me
the
necessity
to
organize
and
plan
this
department
of
our
daily
tasks
on
as
distinct
lines
of
progress
as
we
did
our
business
affairs
and
i
will
try
to
describe
the
underlying
principles
we
arrived
at
and
have
since
followed
out
and
hope
still
greatly
to
extend
it
may
be
beyond
the
pale
of
good
taste
to
speak
at
all
of
such
a
personal
subject
i
am
not
unmindful
of
this
but
i
can
make
these
observations
with
at
least
a
little
better
grace
because
so
much
of
the
hard
work
and
hard
thinking
are
done
by
my
family
and
associates
who
devote
their
lives
to
it
every
man
has
a
philosophy
of
life
whether
he
knows
it
or
not
hidden
away
in
his
mind
are
certain
governing
principles
whether
he
formulates
them
in
words
or
not
which
govern
his
life
surely
his
ideal
ought
to
be
to
contribute
all
that
he
can
however
little
it
may
be
whether
of
money
or
service
to
human
progress
certainly
one
ideal
should
be
to
use
one
means
both
in
investments
and
in
benefactions
for
the
advancement
of
civilization
but
the
question
as
to
what
civilization
is
and
what
are
the
great
laws
which
govern
its
advance
have
been
seriously
studied
our
investments
not
less
than
gifts
have
been
directed
to
such
ends
as
we
have
thought
would
tend
to
produce
these
results
if
you
were
to
go
into
our
office
and
ask
our
committee
on
benevolence
or
our
committee
on
investment
in
what
they
consider
civilization
to
consist
they
would
say
that
they
have
found
in
their
study
that
the
most
convenient
analysis
of
the
elements
which
go
to
make
up
civilization
runs
about
as
follows
progress
in
the
means
of
subsistence
that
is
to
say
progress
in
abundance
and
variety
of
clothing
shelter
sanitation
public
health
commerce
manufacture
the
growth
of
the
public
wealth
etc
progress
in
government
and
law
that
is
to
say
in
the
enactment
of
laws
securing
justice
and
equity
to
every
man
consistent
with
the
largest
individual
liberty
and
the
due
and
orderly
enforcement
of
the
same
upon
all
progress
in
literature
and
language
progress
in
science
and
philosophy
progress
in
art
and
refinement
progress
in
morality
and
religion
if
you
were
to
ask
them
as
indeed
they
are
very
often
asked
which
of
these
they
regard
as
fundamental
they
would
reply
that
they
would
not
attempt
to
answer
that
the
question
is
purely
an
academic
one
that
all
these
go
hand
in
hand
but
that
historically
the
first
of
them
namely
progress
in
means
of
subsistence
had
generally
preceded
progress
in
government
in
literature
in
knowledge
in
refinement
and
in
religion
though
not
itself
of
the
highest
importance
it
is
the
foundation
upon
which
the
whole
superstructure
of
civilization
is
built
and
without
which
it
could
not
exist
accordingly
we
have
sought
so
far
as
we
could
to
make
investments
in
such
a
way
as
will
tend
to
multiply
to
cheapen
and
to
diffuse
as
universally
as
possible
the
comforts
of
life
we
claim
no
credit
for
preferring
these
lines
of
investment
we
make
no
sacrifices
these
are
the
lines
of
largest
and
surest
return
in
this
particular
namely
in
cheapness
ease
of
acquirement
and
universality
of
means
of
subsistence
our
country
easily
surpasses
that
of
any
other
in
the
world
though
we
are
behind
other
countries
perhaps
in
most
of
the
others
it
may
be
asked
how
is
it
consistent
with
the
universal
diffusion
of
these
blessings
that
vast
sums
of
money
should
be
in
single
hands
the
reply
is
as
i
see
it
that
while
men
of
wealth
control
great
sums
of
money
they
do
not
and
can
not
use
them
for
themselves
they
have
indeed
the
legal
title
to
large
properties
and
they
do
control
the
investment
of
them
but
that
is
as
far
as
their
own
relation
to
them
extends
or
can
extend
the
money
is
universally
diffused
in
the
sense
that
it
is
kept
invested
and
it
passes
into
the
week
by
week
up
to
the
present
time
no
scheme
has
yet
presented
itself
which
seems
to
afford
a
better
method
of
handling
capital
than
that
of
individual
ownership
we
might
put
our
money
into
the
treasury
of
the
nation
and
of
the
various
states
but
we
do
not
find
any
promise
in
the
national
or
state
legislatures
viewed
from
the
experiences
of
the
past
that
the
funds
would
be
expended
for
the
general
weal
more
effectively
than
under
the
present
methods
nor
do
we
find
in
any
of
the
schemes
of
socialism
a
promise
that
wealth
would
be
more
wisely
administered
for
the
general
good
it
is
the
duty
of
men
of
means
to
maintain
the
title
to
their
property
and
to
administer
their
funds
until
some
man
or
body
of
men
shall
rise
up
capable
of
administering
for
the
general
good
the
capital
of
the
country
better
than
they
can
the
next
four
elements
of
progress
mentioned
in
the
enumeration
above
namely
progress
in
government
and
law
in
language
and
literature
in
science
and
philosophy
in
art
and
refinement
we
for
ourselves
have
thought
to
be
best
promoted
by
means
of
the
higher
education
and
accordingly
we
have
had
the
great
satisfaction
of
putting
such
sums
as
we
could
into
various
forms
of
education
in
our
own
and
in
foreign
lands
and
education
not
merely
along
the
lines
of
disseminating
more
generally
the
known
but
quite
as
much
and
perhaps
even
more
in
promoting
original
investigation
an
individual
institution
of
learning
can
have
only
a
narrow
sphere
it
can
reach
only
a
limited
number
of
people
but
every
new
fact
discovered
every
widening
of
the
boundaries
of
human
knowledge
by
research
becomes
universally
known
to
all
institutions
of
learning
and
becomes
a
benefaction
at
once
to
the
whole
race
quite
as
interesting
as
any
phase
of
the
work
have
been
the
new
lines
entered
upon
by
our
committee
we
have
not
been
satisfied
with
giving
to
causes
which
have
appealed
to
us
we
have
felt
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
or
the
other
cause
makes
its
appeal
is
no
reason
why
we
should
give
to
it
any
more
than
to
a
thousand
other
causes
perhaps
more
worthy
which
do
not
happen
to
have
come
under
our
eye
the
mere
fact
of
a
personal
appeal
creates
no
claim
which
did
not
exist
before
and
no
preference
over
other
causes
more
worthy
which
may
not
have
made
their
appeal
so
this
little
committee
of
ours
has
not
been
content
to
let
the
benevolences
drift
into
the
channels
of
mere
convenience
to
give
to
the
institutions
which
have
sought
aid
and
to
neglect
others
this
department
has
studied
the
field
of
human
progress
and
sought
to
contribute
to
each
of
those
elements
which
we
believe
tend
most
to
promote
it
where
it
has
not
found
organizations
ready
to
its
hand
for
such
purpose
the
members
of
the
committee
have
sought
to
create
them
we
are
still
working
on
new
and
i
hope
expanding
lines
which
make
large
demands
on
one
intelligence
and
study
the
betterment
work
which
has
always
been
to
me
a
source
of
great
interest
had
a
great
influence
on
my
life
and
i
refer
to
it
here
because
i
wish
to
urge
in
this
connection
the
great
importance
of
a
father
keeping
in
close
touch
with
his
children
taking
into
his
confidence
the
girls
as
well
as
the
boys
who
in
this
way
learn
by
seeing
and
doing
and
have
their
part
in
the
family
responsibilities
as
my
father
taught
me
so
i
have
tried
to
teach
my
children
for
years
it
was
our
custom
to
read
at
the
table
the
letters
we
received
affecting
the
various
benevolences
with
which
we
had
to
do
studying
the
requests
made
for
worthy
purposes
and
following
the
history
and
reports
of
institutions
and
philanthropic
cases
in
which
we
were
interested
chapter
vii
the
benevolent
trust
the
value
of
the
coöperative
principle
in
giving
going
a
step
farther
in
the
plan
of
making
benefactions
increasingly
effective
which
i
took
up
in
the
last
chapter
under
the
title
of
the
difficult
art
of
giving
i
am
tempted
to
take
the
opportunity
to
dwell
a
little
upon
the
subject
of
combination
in
charitable
work
which
has
been
something
of
a
hobby
with
me
for
many
years
if
a
combination
to
do
business
is
effective
in
saving
waste
and
in
getting
better
results
why
is
not
combination
far
more
important
in
philanthropic
work
the
general
idea
of
coöperation
in
giving
for
education
i
have
felt
scored
a
real
step
in
advance
when
andrew
carnegie
consented
to
become
a
member
of
the
general
education
board
for
in
accepting
a
position
in
this
directorate
he
has
it
seems
to
me
stamped
with
his
approval
this
vital
principle
of
coöperation
in
aiding
the
educational
institutions
of
our
country
i
rejoice
as
everybody
must
in
carnegie
enthusiasm
for
using
his
wealth
for
the
benefit
of
his
less
fortunate
fellows
and
i
think
his
devotion
to
his
adopted
land
welfare
has
set
a
striking
example
for
all
time
the
general
education
board
of
which
carnegie
has
now
become
a
member
is
interesting
as
an
example
of
an
organization
formed
for
the
purpose
of
working
out
in
an
orderly
and
rather
scientific
way
the
problem
of
helping
to
stimulate
and
improve
education
in
all
parts
of
our
country
what
this
organization
may
eventually
accomplish
of
course
no
one
can
tell
but
surely
under
its
present
board
of
directors
it
will
go
very
far
here
again
i
feel
that
i
may
speak
frankly
and
express
my
personal
faith
in
its
success
since
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
board
and
have
never
attended
a
meeting
and
the
work
is
all
done
by
others
there
are
some
other
and
larger
plans
thought
out
on
careful
and
broad
lines
which
i
have
been
studying
for
many
years
and
we
can
see
that
they
are
growing
into
definite
shape
it
is
good
to
know
that
there
are
always
unselfish
men
of
the
best
calibre
to
help
in
every
large
philanthropic
enterprise
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
and
stimulating
pieces
of
good
fortune
that
has
come
to
me
is
the
evidence
that
so
many
busy
people
are
willing
to
turn
aside
from
their
work
in
pressing
fields
of
labour
and
to
give
their
best
thoughts
and
energies
without
compensation
to
the
work
of
human
uplift
doctors
clergymen
lawyers
as
well
as
many
men
of
affairs
are
devoting
their
best
and
most
unselfish
efforts
to
some
of
the
plans
that
we
are
all
trying
to
work
out
take
as
one
example
of
many
similar
cases
robert
ogden
who
for
years
while
devoting
himself
to
an
exacting
business
still
found
time
supported
by
wonderful
enthusiasm
to
give
force
by
his
own
personality
to
work
done
in
difficult
parts
of
the
educational
world
particularly
to
improving
the
common
school
system
of
the
south
his
efforts
have
been
wisely
directed
along
fundamental
lines
which
must
produce
results
through
the
years
to
come
fortunately
my
children
have
been
as
earnest
as
i
and
much
more
diligent
in
carefully
and
intelligently
carrying
out
the
work
already
begun
and
agree
with
me
that
at
least
the
same
energy
and
thought
should
be
expended
in
the
proper
and
effective
use
of
money
when
acquired
as
was
exerted
in
the
earning
of
it
the
general
education
board
has
made
or
is
making
a
careful
study
of
the
location
aims
work
resources
administration
and
educational
value
present
and
prospective
of
the
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
the
united
states
the
board
makes
its
contributions
averaging
something
like
two
million
dollars
a
year
on
the
most
careful
comparative
study
of
needs
and
opportunities
throughout
the
country
its
records
are
open
to
all
many
benefactors
of
education
are
availing
themselves
of
these
disinterested
inquiries
and
it
is
hoped
that
more
will
do
so
a
large
number
of
individuals
are
contributing
to
the
support
of
educational
institutions
in
our
country
to
help
an
inefficient
unnecessary
school
is
a
waste
i
am
told
by
those
who
have
given
most
careful
study
to
this
problem
that
it
is
highly
probable
that
enough
money
has
been
squandered
on
unwise
educational
projects
to
have
built
up
a
national
system
of
higher
education
adequate
to
our
needs
if
the
money
had
been
properly
directed
to
that
end
many
of
the
good
people
who
bestow
their
beneficence
on
education
may
well
give
more
thought
to
investigating
the
character
of
the
enterprises
that
they
are
importuned
to
help
and
this
study
ought
to
take
into
account
the
kind
of
people
who
are
responsible
for
their
management
their
location
and
the
facilities
supplied
by
other
institutions
round
about
a
thorough
examination
such
as
this
is
generally
quite
impossible
for
an
individual
and
he
either
declines
to
give
from
lack
of
accurate
knowledge
or
he
may
give
without
due
consideration
if
however
this
work
of
inquiry
is
done
and
well
done
by
the
general
education
board
through
officers
of
intelligence
skill
and
sympathy
trained
to
the
work
important
and
needed
service
is
rendered
the
walls
of
sectarian
exclusiveness
are
fast
disappearing
as
they
should
and
the
best
people
are
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
they
attack
the
great
problems
of
general
uplift
roman
catholic
charities
just
here
it
occurs
to
me
to
testify
to
the
fact
that
the
roman
catholic
church
as
i
have
observed
in
my
experience
has
advanced
a
long
way
in
this
direction
i
have
been
surprised
to
learn
how
far
a
given
sum
of
money
has
gone
in
the
hands
of
priests
and
nuns
and
how
really
effective
is
their
use
of
it
i
fully
appreciate
the
splendid
service
done
by
other
workers
in
the
field
but
i
have
seen
the
organization
of
the
roman
church
secure
better
results
with
a
given
sum
of
money
than
other
church
organizations
are
accustomed
to
secure
from
the
same
expenditure
i
speak
of
this
merely
to
point
the
value
of
the
principle
of
organization
in
which
i
believe
so
heartily
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
upon
the
centuries
of
experience
which
the
church
of
rome
has
gone
through
to
perfect
a
great
power
of
organization
studying
these
problems
has
been
a
source
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
my
assistants
quite
distinct
from
any
board
have
an
organization
of
sufficient
size
to
investigate
the
many
requests
that
come
to
us
this
is
done
from
the
office
of
our
committee
in
new
york
for
an
individual
to
attempt
to
keep
any
close
watch
of
single
cases
would
be
impossible
i
am
called
upon
to
explain
this
fact
many
times
to
read
the
hundreds
of
letters
daily
received
at
our
office
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
any
one
man
and
surely
if
the
many
good
people
who
write
would
only
reflect
a
little
they
must
realize
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
personally
to
consider
their
applications
the
plan
that
we
have
worked
out
and
i
hope
improved
upon
year
after
year
has
been
the
result
of
experience
and
i
refer
to
it
now
only
as
one
contribution
to
a
general
subject
which
is
of
such
great
moment
to
earnest
people
and
this
must
be
my
excuse
for
speaking
so
frankly
the
appeals
that
come
the
reading
assorting
and
investigating
of
the
hundreds
of
letters
of
appeal
which
are
received
daily
at
my
office
are
attended
to
by
a
department
organized
for
this
purpose
the
task
is
not
so
difficult
as
at
first
it
might
seem
the
letters
are
to
be
sure
of
great
variety
from
all
sorts
of
people
in
every
condition
of
life
and
indeed
from
all
parts
of
the
world
of
these
letters
are
however
requests
for
money
for
personal
use
with
no
other
title
to
consideration
than
that
the
writer
would
be
gratified
to
have
it
there
remain
numbers
of
requests
which
all
must
recognize
as
worthy
of
notice
these
may
be
divided
roughly
as
follows
the
claims
of
local
charities
the
town
or
city
in
which
one
lives
has
a
definite
appeal
to
all
its
citizens
and
all
good
neighbours
will
wish
to
coöperate
with
friends
and
fellow
townsmen
but
these
local
charities
hospitals
kindergartens
and
the
like
ought
not
to
make
appeal
outside
the
local
communities
which
they
serve
the
burden
should
be
carried
by
the
people
who
are
on
the
spot
and
who
are
or
should
be
most
familiar
with
local
needs
then
come
the
national
and
international
claims
these
properly
appeal
especially
to
men
of
large
means
throughout
the
country
whose
wealth
admits
of
their
doing
something
more
than
assist
in
caring
for
the
local
charities
there
are
many
great
national
and
international
philanthropic
and
christian
organizations
that
cover
the
whole
field
of
charity
and
while
people
of
reputed
wealth
all
receive
appeals
from
individual
workers
throughout
the
world
for
personal
assistance
the
prudent
and
thoughtful
giver
will
more
and
more
choose
these
great
and
responsible
organizations
as
the
medium
for
his
gifts
and
the
distribution
of
his
funds
to
distant
fields
this
has
been
my
custom
and
the
experience
of
every
day
serves
only
to
confirm
its
wisdom
the
great
value
of
dealing
with
an
organization
which
knows
all
the
facts
and
can
best
decide
just
where
the
help
can
be
applied
to
the
best
advantage
has
impressed
itself
upon
me
through
the
results
of
long
years
of
experience
for
example
one
is
asked
to
give
in
a
certain
field
of
missionary
work
a
sum
for
a
definite
purpose
let
us
say
a
hospital
to
comply
with
this
request
will
take
say
it
seems
wise
and
natural
to
give
this
amount
the
missionary
who
wants
this
money
is
working
under
the
direction
of
a
strong
and
capable
religious
denomination
suppose
the
request
is
referred
to
the
manager
of
the
board
of
this
denomination
and
it
transpires
that
there
are
many
good
reasons
why
a
new
hospital
is
not
badly
needed
at
this
point
and
by
a
little
good
management
the
need
of
this
missionary
can
be
met
by
another
hospital
in
its
neighbourhood
whereas
another
missionary
in
another
place
has
no
such
possibility
for
any
hospital
facilities
whatever
there
is
no
question
that
the
money
should
be
spent
in
the
place
last
named
these
conditions
the
managers
of
all
the
mission
stations
know
although
perhaps
the
one
who
is
giving
the
money
never
heard
of
them
and
in
my
judgment
he
is
wise
in
not
acting
until
he
has
consulted
these
men
of
larger
information
it
is
interesting
to
follow
the
mental
processes
that
some
excellent
souls
go
through
to
cloud
their
consciences
when
they
consider
what
their
duty
actually
is
for
instance
one
man
says
i
do
not
believe
in
giving
money
to
street
beggars
i
agree
with
him
i
do
not
believe
in
the
practice
either
but
that
is
not
a
reason
why
one
should
be
exempt
from
doing
something
to
help
the
situation
represented
by
the
street
beggar
because
one
does
not
yield
to
the
importunities
of
such
people
is
exactly
the
reason
one
should
join
and
uphold
the
charity
organization
societies
of
one
own
locality
which
deal
justly
and
humanely
with
this
class
separating
the
worthy
from
the
unworthy
another
says
i
do
give
to
such
and
such
a
board
because
i
have
read
that
of
the
money
given
only
half
or
less
actually
gets
to
the
person
needing
help
this
is
often
not
a
true
statement
of
fact
as
proved
again
and
again
and
even
if
it
were
true
in
part
it
does
not
relieve
the
possible
giver
from
the
duty
of
helping
to
make
the
organization
more
efficient
by
no
possible
chance
is
it
a
valid
excuse
for
closing
up
one
pocketbook
and
dismissing
the
whole
subject
from
one
mind
institutions
as
they
relate
to
each
other
surely
it
is
wise
to
be
careful
not
to
duplicate
effort
and
not
to
inaugurate
new
charities
in
fields
already
covered
but
rather
to
strengthen
and
perfect
those
already
at
work
there
is
a
great
deal
of
rivalry
and
a
vast
amount
of
duplication
and
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
in
giving
is
to
ascertain
when
the
field
is
fully
covered
many
people
simply
consider
whether
the
institution
to
which
they
are
giving
is
thoughtfully
and
well
managed
without
stopping
to
discover
whether
the
field
is
not
already
occupied
by
others
and
for
this
reason
one
ought
not
to
investigate
a
single
institution
by
itself
but
always
in
its
relation
to
all
similar
institutions
in
the
territory
here
is
a
case
in
point
a
number
of
enthusiastic
people
had
a
plan
for
founding
an
orphan
asylum
which
was
to
be
conducted
by
one
of
our
strongest
religious
denominations
the
raising
of
the
necessary
funds
was
begun
and
among
the
people
who
were
asked
to
subscribe
was
a
man
who
always
made
it
a
practice
to
study
the
situation
carefully
before
committing
himself
to
a
contribution
he
asked
one
of
the
promoters
of
the
new
institution
how
many
beds
the
present
asylums
serving
this
community
provided
how
efficient
they
were
where
located
and
what
particular
class
of
institution
was
lacking
in
the
community
to
none
of
these
questions
were
answers
forthcoming
so
he
had
this
information
gathered
on
his
own
account
with
the
purpose
of
helping
to
make
the
new
plan
effective
his
studies
revealed
the
fact
that
the
city
where
the
new
asylum
was
to
be
built
was
so
well
provided
with
such
institutions
that
there
were
already
vastly
more
beds
for
children
than
there
were
applicants
to
fill
them
and
that
the
field
was
well
and
fully
covered
these
facts
being
presented
to
the
organizers
of
the
enterprise
it
was
shown
that
no
real
need
for
such
an
institution
existed
i
wish
i
might
add
that
the
scheme
was
abandoned
it
was
not
such
charities
seldom
are
when
once
the
sympathies
of
the
worthy
people
however
misinformed
are
heartily
enlisted
it
may
be
urged
that
doing
the
work
in
this
systematic
and
apparently
way
leaves
out
of
consideration
to
a
large
extent
the
merits
of
individual
cases
my
contention
is
that
the
organization
of
work
in
combination
should
not
and
does
not
stifle
the
work
of
individuals
but
strengthens
and
stimulates
it
the
orderly
combination
of
philanthropic
effort
is
growing
daily
and
at
the
same
time
the
spirit
of
broad
philanthropy
never
was
so
general
as
it
is
now
the
claim
of
higher
education
the
giver
who
works
out
these
problems
for
himself
will
no
doubt
find
many
critics
so
many
people
see
the
pressing
needs
of
life
that
possibly
they
fail
to
realize
those
which
are
if
less
obvious
of
an
even
larger
significance
for
instance
the
great
claims
of
higher
education
ignorance
is
the
source
of
a
large
part
of
the
poverty
and
a
vast
amount
of
the
crime
in
the
world
hence
the
need
of
education
if
we
assist
the
highest
forms
of
education
in
whatever
field
we
secure
the
widest
influence
in
enlarging
the
boundaries
of
human
knowledge
for
all
the
new
facts
discovered
or
set
in
motion
become
the
universal
heritage
i
think
we
can
not
overestimate
the
importance
of
this
matter
the
mere
fact
that
most
of
the
great
achievements
in
science
medicine
art
and
literature
are
the
flower
of
the
higher
education
is
sufficient
some
great
writer
will
one
day
show
how
these
things
have
ministered
to
the
wants
of
all
the
people
educated
and
uneducated
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
and
made
life
more
what
we
all
wish
it
to
be
the
best
philanthropy
is
constantly
in
search
of
the
finalities
a
search
for
cause
an
attempt
to
cure
evils
at
their
source
my
interest
in
the
university
of
chicago
has
been
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
while
it
has
comprehensively
considered
the
other
features
of
a
collegiate
course
it
has
given
so
much
attention
to
research
william
harper
the
mention
of
this
promising
young
institution
always
brings
to
my
mind
the
figure
of
william
harper
whose
enthusiasm
for
its
work
was
so
great
that
no
vision
of
its
future
seemed
too
large
my
first
meeting
with
harper
was
at
vassar
college
where
one
of
my
daughters
was
a
student
he
used
to
come
as
the
guest
of
james
taylor
the
president
to
lecture
on
sundays
and
as
i
frequently
spent
there
i
saw
and
talked
much
with
the
young
professor
then
of
yale
and
caught
in
some
degree
the
contagion
of
his
enthusiasm
when
the
university
had
been
founded
and
he
had
taken
the
presidency
our
great
ambition
was
to
secure
the
best
instructors
and
to
organize
the
new
institution
unhampered
by
traditions
according
to
the
most
modern
ideals
he
raised
millions
of
dollars
among
the
people
of
chicago
and
the
middle
west
and
won
the
personal
interest
of
their
leading
citizens
here
lay
his
great
strength
for
he
secured
not
only
their
money
but
their
loyal
support
and
strong
personal
interest
the
best
kind
of
help
and
coöperation
he
built
even
better
than
he
knew
his
lofty
ideals
embodied
in
the
university
awakened
a
deeper
interest
in
higher
education
throughout
the
central
west
and
stirred
individuals
denominations
and
legislatures
to
effective
action
the
world
will
probably
never
realize
how
largely
the
present
splendid
university
system
of
the
central
western
states
is
due
indirectly
to
the
genius
of
this
man
with
all
his
extraordinary
power
of
work
and
his
executive
and
organizing
ability
harper
was
a
man
of
exquisite
personal
charm
we
count
it
among
the
rich
and
delightful
experiences
of
our
that
and
harper
could
occasionally
spend
days
together
with
us
for
a
brief
respite
from
the
exacting
cares
and
responsibilities
of
the
university
work
as
a
friend
and
companion
in
daily
intercourse
no
one
could
be
more
delightful
than
he
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
contribute
at
various
times
to
the
university
of
chicago
of
which
harper
was
president
and
the
newspapers
not
unnaturally
supposed
at
such
times
that
he
used
the
occasions
of
our
personal
association
to
secure
these
contributions
the
cartoonists
used
to
find
this
a
fruitful
theme
they
would
picture
harper
as
a
hypnotist
waving
his
magic
spell
or
would
represent
him
forcing
his
way
into
my
inner
office
where
i
was
pictured
as
busy
cutting
coupons
and
from
which
delightful
employment
i
incontinently
fled
out
of
the
window
at
sight
of
him
or
they
would
represent
me
as
fleeing
across
rivers
on
cakes
of
floating
ice
with
harper
in
hot
pursuit
or
perhaps
he
would
be
following
close
on
my
trail
like
the
wolf
in
the
russian
story
in
inaccessible
country
retreats
while
i
escaped
only
by
means
of
the
slight
delays
i
occasioned
him
by
now
and
then
dropping
a
bill
which
he
would
be
obliged
to
stop
and
pick
up
these
cartoons
were
intended
to
be
very
amusing
and
some
of
them
certainly
did
have
a
flavour
of
humour
but
they
were
never
humorous
to
harper
they
were
in
fact
a
source
of
deep
humiliation
to
him
and
i
am
sure
he
would
were
he
living
be
glad
to
have
me
say
as
i
now
do
that
during
the
entire
period
of
his
presidency
of
the
university
of
chicago
he
never
once
either
wrote
me
a
letter
or
asked
me
personally
for
a
dollar
of
money
for
the
university
of
chicago
in
the
most
intimate
daily
intercourse
with
him
in
my
home
the
finances
of
the
university
of
chicago
were
never
canvassed
or
discussed
the
method
of
procedure
in
this
case
has
been
substantially
the
same
as
with
all
other
contributions
the
presentation
of
the
needs
of
the
university
has
been
made
in
writing
by
the
officers
of
the
university
whose
special
duty
it
is
to
prepare
its
budgets
and
superintend
its
finances
a
committee
of
the
trustees
with
the
president
have
annually
conferred
at
a
fixed
time
with
our
department
of
benevolence
as
to
its
needs
their
conclusions
have
generally
been
entirely
unanimous
and
i
have
found
no
occasion
hitherto
seriously
to
depart
from
their
recommendations
there
have
been
no
personal
interviews
and
no
personal
solicitations
it
has
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
make
these
contributions
but
that
pleasure
has
arisen
out
of
the
fact
that
the
university
is
located
in
a
great
centre
of
empire
that
it
has
rooted
itself
in
the
affections
and
interest
of
the
people
among
whom
it
is
located
that
it
is
doing
a
great
and
needed
work
in
fine
that
it
has
been
able
to
attract
and
to
justify
the
contributions
of
its
patrons
east
and
west
it
is
not
personal
interviews
and
impassioned
appeals
but
sound
and
justifying
worth
that
should
attract
and
secure
the
funds
of
philanthropy
the
people
in
great
numbers
who
are
constantly
importuning
me
for
personal
interviews
in
behalf
of
favourite
causes
err
in
supposing
that
the
interview
were
it
possible
is
the
best
way
or
even
a
good
way
of
securing
what
they
want
our
practice
has
been
uniformly
to
request
applicants
to
state
their
cases
tersely
but
nevertheless
as
fully
as
they
think
necessary
in
writing
their
application
is
carefully
considered
by
very
competent
people
chosen
for
this
purpose
if
thereupon
personal
interviews
are
found
desirable
by
our
assistants
they
are
invited
from
our
office
written
presentations
form
the
necessary
basis
of
investigation
of
consultation
and
comparison
of
views
between
the
different
members
of
our
staff
and
of
the
final
presentation
to
me
it
is
impossible
to
conduct
this
department
of
our
work
in
any
other
way
the
rule
requiring
written
presentation
as
against
the
interview
is
enforced
and
adhered
to
not
as
the
applicant
sometimes
supposes
as
a
cold
rebuff
to
him
but
in
order
to
secure
for
his
cause
if
it
be
a
good
one
the
careful
consideration
which
is
its
due
a
consideration
that
can
not
be
given
in
a
mere
verbal
interview
the
reason
for
conditional
gifts
it
is
easy
to
do
harm
in
giving
money
to
give
to
institutions
which
should
be
supported
by
others
is
not
the
best
philanthropy
such
giving
only
serves
to
dry
up
the
natural
springs
of
charity
it
is
highly
important
that
every
charitable
institution
shall
have
at
all
times
the
largest
possible
number
of
current
contributors
this
means
that
the
institution
shall
constantly
be
making
its
appeals
but
if
these
constant
appeals
are
to
be
successful
the
institution
is
forced
to
do
excellent
work
and
meet
real
and
manifest
needs
moreover
the
interest
of
many
people
affords
the
best
assurance
of
wise
economy
and
unselfish
management
as
well
as
of
continued
support
we
frequently
make
our
gifts
conditional
on
the
giving
of
others
not
because
we
wish
to
force
people
to
do
their
duty
but
because
we
wish
in
this
way
to
root
the
institution
in
the
affections
of
as
many
people
as
possible
who
as
contributors
become
personally
concerned
and
thereafter
may
be
counted
on
to
give
to
the
institution
their
watchful
interest
and
coöperation
conditional
gifts
are
often
criticized
and
sometimes
it
may
be
by
people
who
have
not
thought
the
matter
out
fully
criticism
which
is
deliberate
sober
and
fair
is
always
valuable
and
it
should
be
welcomed
by
all
who
desire
progress
i
have
had
at
least
my
full
share
of
adverse
criticism
but
i
can
truly
say
that
it
has
not
embittered
me
nor
left
me
with
any
harsh
feeling
against
a
living
soul
nor
do
i
wish
to
be
critical
of
those
whose
conscientious
judgment
frankly
expressed
differs
from
my
own
no
matter
how
noisy
the
pessimists
may
be
we
know
that
the
world
is
getting
better
steadily
and
rapidly
and
that
is
a
good
thing
to
remember
in
our
moments
of
depression
or
humiliation
the
benevolent
trusts
to
return
to
the
subject
of
the
benevolent
trusts
which
is
a
name
for
corporations
to
manage
the
business
side
of
benefactions
the
idea
needs
and
to
be
successful
must
have
the
help
of
men
who
have
been
trained
along
practical
lines
the
best
men
of
business
should
be
attracted
by
its
possibilities
for
good
when
it
is
eventually
worked
out
as
it
will
be
in
some
form
and
probably
in
a
better
one
than
we
can
now
forecast
how
worthy
it
will
be
of
the
efforts
of
our
ablest
men
we
shall
have
the
best
charities
supported
generously
and
adequately
managed
with
scientific
efficiency
by
the
ablest
men
who
will
gladly
he
held
strictly
accountable
to
the
donors
of
the
money
not
only
for
the
correct
financing
of
the
funds
but
for
the
intelligent
and
effective
use
of
every
penny
the
whole
machinery
of
benevolence
is
conducted
upon
more
or
less
haphazard
principles
good
men
and
women
are
wearing
out
their
lives
to
raise
money
to
sustain
institutions
which
are
conducted
by
more
less
or
unskilled
methods
this
is
a
tremendous
waste
of
our
best
material
we
can
not
afford
to
have
great
souls
who
are
capable
of
doing
the
most
effective
work
slaving
to
raise
the
money
that
should
be
a
business
man
task
and
he
should
be
supreme
in
managing
the
machinery
of
the
expenses
the
teachers
the
workers
and
the
inspired
leaders
of
the
people
should
be
relieved
of
these
pressing
and
belittling
money
cares
they
have
more
than
enough
to
do
in
tilling
their
tremendous
and
never
fully
occupied
field
and
they
should
be
free
from
any
care
which
might
in
any
wise
divert
them
from
that
work
when
these
benevolent
trusts
come
into
active
being
such
organizations
on
broad
lines
will
be
sure
to
attract
the
brains
of
the
best
men
we
have
in
our
commercial
affairs
as
great
business
opportunities
attract
them
now
our
successful
business
men
as
a
class
and
the
exceptions
only
prove
the
truth
of
the
assertion
have
a
high
standard
of
honour
i
have
sometimes
been
tempted
to
say
that
our
clergymen
could
gain
by
knowing
the
essentials
of
business
life
better
the
closer
association
with
men
of
affairs
would
i
think
benefit
both
classes
people
who
have
had
much
to
do
with
ministers
and
those
who
hold
confidential
positions
in
our
churches
have
at
times
had
surprising
experiences
in
meeting
what
is
sometimes
practised
in
the
way
of
ecclesiastical
business
because
these
good
men
have
had
so
little
of
business
training
in
the
world
the
whole
system
of
proper
relations
whether
it
be
in
commerce
or
in
the
church
or
in
the
sciences
rests
on
honour
able
business
men
seek
to
confine
their
dealings
to
people
who
tell
the
truth
and
keep
their
promises
and
the
representatives
of
the
church
who
are
often
prone
to
attack
business
men
as
a
type
of
what
is
selfish
and
mean
have
some
great
lessons
to
learn
and
they
will
gladly
learn
them
as
these
two
types
of
workers
grow
closer
together
the
benevolent
trusts
when
they
come
will
raise
these
standards
they
will
look
the
facts
in
the
face
they
will
applaud
and
sustain
the
effective
workers
and
institutions
and
they
will
uplift
the
intelligent
standard
of
good
work
in
helping
all
the
people
chiefly
to
help
themselves
there
are
already
signs
that
these
combinations
are
coming
and
coming
quickly
and
in
the
directorates
of
these
trusts
you
will
eventually
find
the
flower
of
our
american
manhood
the
men
who
not
only
know
how
to
make
money
but
who
accept
the
great
responsibility
of
administering
it
wisely
a
few
years
ago
on
the
occasion
of
the
decennial
anniversary
of
the
university
of
chicago
i
was
attending
a
university
dinner
and
having
been
asked
to
speak
i
had
jotted
down
a
few
notes
when
the
time
arrived
to
stand
up
and
face
these
guests
men
of
worth
and
position
my
notes
meant
nothing
to
me
as
i
thought
of
the
latent
power
of
good
that
rested
with
these
rich
and
influential
people
i
was
greatly
affected
i
threw
down
my
notes
and
started
to
plead
for
my
benevolent
trust
plan
you
men
i
said
are
always
looking
forward
to
do
something
for
good
causes
i
know
how
very
busy
you
are
you
work
in
a
treadmill
from
which
you
see
no
escape
i
can
easily
understand
that
you
feel
that
it
is
beyond
your
present
power
carefully
to
study
the
needs
of
humanity
and
that
you
wait
to
give
until
you
have
considered
many
things
and
decided
upon
some
course
of
action
now
why
not
do
with
what
you
can
give
to
others
as
you
do
with
what
you
want
to
keep
for
yourself
and
your
children
put
it
into
a
trust
you
would
not
place
a
fortune
for
your
children
in
the
hands
of
an
inexperienced
person
no
matter
how
good
he
might
be
let
us
be
as
careful
with
the
money
we
would
spend
for
the
benefit
of
others
as
if
we
were
laying
it
aside
for
our
own
family
future
use
directors
carry
on
these
affairs
in
your
behalf
let
us
erect
a
foundation
a
trust
and
engage
directors
who
will
make
it
a
life
work
to
manage
with
our
personal
coöperation
this
business
of
benevolence
properly
and
effectively
and
i
beg
of
you
attend
to
it
do
wait
i
confess
i
felt
most
strongly
on
the
subject
and
i
feel
so
now
