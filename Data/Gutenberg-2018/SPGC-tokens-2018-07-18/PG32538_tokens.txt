the
tower
as
the
steamer
from
stralsund
is
approaching
the
gulf
of
finland
the
passenger
attention
is
attracted
by
an
object
which
projects
high
out
of
the
sea
he
will
hear
the
seamen
call
it
the
tower
of
dago
an
old
and
wealthy
englishman
he
may
be
told
on
one
occasion
felt
impelled
by
curiosity
to
ask
the
captain
what
it
would
cost
him
to
examine
the
ruin
close
at
hand
the
answer
was
clothed
in
language
less
polite
than
forcible
merely
the
shrivelled
skin
and
bones
you
carry
about
with
you
sir
for
hitherto
the
tower
of
dago
has
been
spared
an
appearance
in
our
art
galleries
only
by
the
circumstance
that
it
can
not
well
be
got
before
the
painter
easel
it
is
built
upon
the
outermost
point
of
a
rocky
promontory
of
the
great
island
of
dago
the
projecting
headland
lies
obliquely
across
the
northern
current
and
the
sea
makes
a
ceaseless
seething
whirlpool
round
the
obstruction
the
all
around
is
strewn
with
most
perilous
reefs
among
their
intricate
labyrinths
even
the
skiffs
of
the
most
adroit
boatmen
are
in
danger
of
being
dashed
in
pieces
and
yet
for
a
sight
of
the
tower
of
dago
one
might
well
risk
life
especially
at
a
time
when
the
raging
storm
is
clothing
it
with
all
its
picturesque
grandeur
the
extreme
ledge
of
the
promontory
is
a
great
block
of
rock
it
rises
precipitously
out
of
the
dark
green
waves
which
incessantly
storm
it
with
their
some
monster
will
often
lash
itself
aloft
to
the
very
summit
frightening
the
seagulls
and
eagles
that
love
to
range
themselves
along
the
verge
of
the
rock
from
this
ledge
rises
a
tower
some
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
the
lower
part
is
built
in
cyclopean
fashion
of
massive
uncut
blocks
of
rock
the
upper
portion
is
of
red
stones
these
reach
to
the
very
summit
of
the
tower
the
battlements
of
which
are
surmounted
by
the
luxuriant
green
of
juniper
shrubs
and
when
the
setting
sun
bursting
through
a
cloud
casts
his
rays
upon
the
dead
giant
rising
there
in
his
solitude
while
round
about
the
low
ashen
clouds
seem
almost
to
touch
his
head
when
the
sea
roars
beneath
and
breaks
in
foam
against
his
feet
when
the
reflected
sunlight
streams
back
like
the
rays
of
a
lighthouse
from
some
window
the
panes
of
which
are
haply
still
unshattered
then
the
glowing
colossus
seems
a
very
polyphemus
who
with
his
one
eye
dares
to
defy
the
gods
and
wage
eternal
feud
with
men
that
is
the
tower
of
dago
but
in
perfect
calm
the
scene
is
changed
veiled
in
translucent
mists
the
tower
rises
aloft
in
grand
repose
beneath
the
hot
unclouded
summer
sky
towards
the
summit
it
shows
a
great
gap
like
a
mighty
mouth
petrified
in
the
act
of
making
an
imprecation
a
mouth
gaping
wide
as
if
to
salute
the
sea
or
hail
yonder
craft
that
glides
along
the
horizon
at
too
the
great
rock
hidden
companions
the
sunken
reefs
begin
to
show
themselves
all
around
among
them
half
sunk
in
the
sand
are
seen
the
shattered
remains
of
masts
rusty
anchors
and
guns
all
overgrown
with
seaweed
and
here
and
there
the
eye
perceives
a
human
skull
still
encased
in
a
helmet
a
skeleton
still
protected
by
a
shirt
of
mail
and
innumerable
remnants
of
stranded
ships
with
their
inscriptions
and
marks
still
readable
at
one
spot
is
seen
the
bottom
of
a
vessel
whose
copper
plates
now
hidden
now
disclosed
by
the
restless
motion
of
the
waves
are
green
with
verdigris
and
everywhere
the
great
and
monster
crabs
lords
of
the
abyss
crawl
and
gloat
unceasingly
among
the
wreckage
then
the
spectator
shuddering
at
this
terrible
arrangement
of
still
life
is
forced
to
ask
himself
who
could
have
been
so
mad
as
to
build
a
tower
like
this
on
such
an
accursed
spot
and
who
the
madmen
that
could
steer
their
vessels
hither
on
these
cruel
rocks
and
could
there
be
any
link
of
destiny
connecting
that
forbidding
edifice
with
the
wreckage
that
lay
around

back
to
the
sea
in
the
time
of
catherine
ii
a
baron
of
the
von
ungern
family
in
the
province
of
brandenburg
migrated
to
the
court
of
petersburg
he
had
some
slavonic
blood
in
his
veins
and
shortly
after
settling
in
the
russian
capital
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
muscovite
nobleman
his
wife
dowry
brought
him
several
extensive
estates
in
volhynia
in
spite
of
their
german
name
his
two
sons
were
perfect
russians
the
elder
feodor
was
a
naval
officer
he
was
a
thorough
seaman
and
the
terror
of
every
swedish
seaport
and
merchantman
zeno
the
younger
brother
was
also
a
seaman
but
his
tactical
abilities
were
exercised
only
at
court
and
particularly
among
the
ladies
the
fame
of
the
elder
brother
naturally
lent
brilliancy
to
zeno
name
also
feodor
however
willingly
left
to
him
all
the
pleasures
of
court
life
and
all
its
dazzling
distinctions
such
things
were
not
for
him
the
sea
and
its
perilous
combats
were
for
feodor
his
chiefest
joy
yet
when
storm
and
fight
alike
were
lulled
to
rest
he
loved
his
quiet
home
a
little
castle
buried
in
an
old
forest
where
his
dear
and
beautiful
wife
dwelt
with
her
little
son
the
boy
whose
name
was
alexander
was
now
four
years
old
and
the
father
was
not
less
proud
of
his
domestic
fortune
than
of
his
naval
laurels
feodor
had
just
accomplished
one
of
his
most
heroic
exploits
against
the
swedes
one
stormy
night
he
had
suddenly
surprised
the
convoy
fleet
at
karlskrona
and
burnt
a
large
portion
of
it
he
had
captured
several
richly
laden
which
tried
hard
to
get
out
of
range
plundered
them
of
their
most
valuable
contents
and
then
sent
them
to
the
bottom
he
had
also
carried
off
the
magnificent
bell
which
had
been
taken
by
the
swedes
from
hamburg
city
and
was
then
on
its
way
to
adorn
the
cathedral
of
kalmar
then
he
returned
unmolested
with
booty
and
fame
to
kronstadt
upon
arriving
there
he
considered
it
his
first
duty
to
deliver
an
account
of
his
actions
to
the
admiral
of
the
fleet
at
that
time
the
shore
at
kronstadt
was
covered
with
a
great
number
of
small
huts
inhabited
by
the
workmen
in
the
port
as
captain
feodor
leaped
ashore
from
his
boat
a
girl
who
had
been
watching
the
spot
for
some
time
came
out
of
one
of
the
huts
and
approached
him
the
girl
was
young
and
pretty
and
was
dressed
in
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
volhynian
women
she
hurried
up
to
the
officer
and
seized
his
hand
to
kiss
it
he
recognised
her
immediately
as
his
little
son
nurse
what
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
mashinka
why
what
brings
you
here
the
girl
raised
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
glanced
timorously
round
about
only
when
she
had
assured
herself
that
there
was
no
one
listening
did
she
begin
to
speak
oh
my
master
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
tone
have
a
care
muffle
yourself
in
your
cloak
if
you
are
recognised
here
you
will
certainly
be
taken
taken
cried
the
captain
what
foolishness
is
this
mashinka
why
should
any
one
wish
to
take
me
think
you
why
echoed
the
girl
to
make
you
dig
for
lead
in
the
urals
most
likely
you
are
an
outlaw
are
you
raving
woman
asked
feodor
what
crime
have
i
committed
that
you
will
soon
learn
replied
mashinka
last
winter
did
you
not
shelter
krazinski
in
your
house
krazinski
why
he
was
a
dear
friend
of
mine
a
of
the
old
days
that
may
be
but
now
they
say
he
is
a
conspirator
but
what
is
that
to
me
i
knew
nothing
of
that
then
he
came
to
the
castle
for
the
hunting
and
after
having
had
as
much
of
that
as
he
wanted
he
went
off
again
but
i
see
i
had
better
go
off
to
the
court
at
once
and
tell
them
all
about
the
matter
nay
master
go
not
there
whispered
the
girl
imploringly
there
you
have
a
most
powerful
enemy
whom
your
death
alone
will
pacify
an
enemy
who
is
he
asked
feodor
in
surprise
your
brother
replied
mashinka
what
zeno
he
whom
i
loved
so
much
that
i
made
over
to
him
my
inheritance
and
even
the
title
of
count
as
well
reserving
only
a
minor
portion
for
myself
ay
and
now
he
means
to
have
that
portion
also
said
mashinka
he
has
seized
your
castle
in
the
forest
and
even
that
seaman
whistle
at
your
breast
he
has
already
been
promised
that
well
well
fool
that
i
am
muttered
feodor
was
he
not
all
his
life
a
miserable
cur
after
all
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
but
what
can
he
know
of
krazinski
this
much
that
krazinski
in
leaving
forgot
to
take
with
him
a
certain
leather
and
that
it
contained
many
dangerous
papers
but
i
myself
delivered
that
case
to
my
wife
in
order
that
she
might
take
charge
of
it
until
krazinski
should
demand
it
she
was
to
give
it
up
to
no
one
else
and
yet
she
has
given
it
up
to
your
brother
and
because
of
that
you
have
been
outlawed
my
wife
exclaimed
captain
feodor
turning
pale
she
only
was
your
wife
now
she
is
your
brother
whoever
is
banished
for
life
to
the
ural
mines
is
at
the
same
time
separated
for
ever
from
his
wife
and
she
can
at
once
marry
again
that
is
how
it
happened
you
were
too
long
gone
and
love
in
absence
they
say
is
difficult
but
she
had
her
son
cried
the
captain
in
a
tone
of
agony
was
not
he
enough
to
love
and
such
a
son
too
tell
me
what
have
they
done
with
my
son
you
know
well
the
custom
surely
when
the
father
is
banished
the
child
is
outlawed
also
son
must
follow
father
and
in
order
that
he
may
never
return
he
is
branded
with
a
iron
on
the
shoulder
the
captain
seemed
about
to
reply
but
the
words
died
away
upon
his
lips
suddenly
he
seized
the
girl
shoulders
in
his
powerful
grasp
and
began
to
stare
intently
into
her
eyes
for
it
is
a
common
belief
in
volhynia
that
there
are
many
unhappy
mortals
possessed
by
the
evil
one
in
such
a
way
that
he
takes
up
his
abode
in
their
eyeballs
then
by
means
of
all
manner
of
phantoms
and
illusions
he
causes
them
to
see
the
things
that
are
not
about
such
sights
the
victims
talk
as
if
they
were
perfectly
real
but
it
is
believed
that
if
a
truly
brave
and
upright
man
who
fears
not
the
evil
one
seizes
the
possessed
person
firmly
by
the
shoulders
gazes
unflinchingly
into
the
bewitched
eyes
until
he
perceives
the
demon
lurking
within
and
then
quickly
and
unexpectedly
spits
into
them
then
the
evil
spirit
is
confounded
and
flies
in
confusion
from
the
possessed
one
eyes
thus
did
captain
feodor
ah
yes
it
may
be
it
may
indeed
be
so
said
the
girl
resignedly
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
hem
of
her
apron
often
have
i
asked
myself
whether
all
i
have
seen
and
heard
is
not
merely
falsehood
and
deceit
it
may
be
all
the
devil
work
oh
would
to
god
it
were
so
i
would
bless
you
every
day
of
my
life
for
driving
the
curse
out
of
me
but
master
i
beseech
you
cross
the
threshold
of
that
hut
and
look
within
if
you
see
nothing
then
the
evil
one
has
indeed
been
at
his
juggling
tricks
with
me
making
me
see
and
speak
the
things
that
are
not
feodor
stepped
into
the
hut
to
which
mashinka
had
pointed
the
first
thing
that
met
his
gaze
was
his
little
son
lying
on
a
heap
of
dirty
straw
the
little
shirt
had
slipped
down
over
one
shoulder
and
upon
this
the
mark
of
the
was
clearly
seen
feodor
knelt
down
buried
his
face
in
the
straw
beside
the
boy
and
clasped
him
in
his
arms
but
he
uttered
no
cry
and
shed
no
tear
why
my
good
master
said
the
girl
surely
you
too
have
become
possessed
and
see
things
that
do
not
exist
meantime
the
child
did
not
cry
he
trembled
violently
for
fear
and
pain
and
fever
were
working
together
the
father
wrapped
him
in
his
cloak
and
laid
him
tenderly
across
his
knees
now
listen
said
mashinka
to
all
that
the
evil
one
must
have
put
into
my
eyes
and
ears
if
indeed
it
is
all
nothing
but
his
black
magic
your
own
steward
had
orders
to
bring
all
your
treasure
in
a
great
iron
chest
along
with
the
child
to
tsarskoye
selo
your
brother
and
your
wife
were
already
in
petersburg
together
the
treasure
was
to
be
divided
among
i
know
not
how
many
of
the
high
court
officials
your
wife
of
course
fell
to
the
informer
portion
and
the
child
was
sent
off
later
in
order
to
be
transported
to
the
urals
along
with
you
as
the
boy
begged
most
piteously
for
me
i
was
allowed
to
travel
along
with
him
he
cried
during
the
whole
journey
with
the
pain
caused
by
the
at
last
the
steward
could
no
longer
bear
his
constant
moaning
in
the
carriage
and
ordered
me
to
get
down
and
gather
some
in
the
field
so
that
i
might
make
an
infusion
of
them
and
put
the
child
to
sleep
so
i
gathered
a
great
many
and
made
them
into
a
good
strong
tea
at
our
next
but
i
did
not
give
it
to
the
boy
to
drink
i
mixed
it
among
the
brandy
which
the
steward
the
driver
and
the
cossacks
were
drinking
and
it
was
not
long
before
their
heads
were
nodding
under
it
i
then
took
the
keys
of
the
iron
chest
from
the
steward
pocket
flung
him
out
of
the
tro√Øka
and
the
driver
after
him
seized
the
reins
and
drove
off
with
the
boy
but
when
the
cossacks
had
become
a
little
sober
they
came
galloping
after
us
when
i
saw
that
we
must
soon
be
overtaken
i
opened
the
took
out
great
handfuls
of
gold
and
silver
and
flung
them
on
the
road
of
course
they
could
not
let
stuff
of
that
kind
lie
and
by
the
time
they
had
scraped
it
all
together
we
were
far
away
over
hill
and
dale
on
reaching
the
forest
of
pleskov
the
middle
horse
became
lame
and
i
saw
that
i
could
not
hope
to
save
both
the
money
and
the
child
i
should
have
had
to
sacrifice
either
one
or
other
so
i
told
the
boy
to
clasp
me
tightly
round
the
neck
and
away
we
fled
together
across
the
steppe
i
had
previously
turned
the
horses
loose
with
the
tro√Øka
no
doubt
the
cossacks
overtook
the
carriage
with
all
the
treasure
but
i
brought
the
child
here
through
the
forests
and
across
the
moors
for
i
knew
that
you
would
land
here
when
you
returned
from
the
sea
but
you
are
not
angry
with
me
master
for
bringing
only
the
boy
with
me
instead
of
all
the
gold
as
yet
not
a
tear
had
risen
to
the
rugged
seaman
eyes
he
sat
staring
with
frenzied
look
at
the
cruel
brand
upon
his
son
shoulder
but
suddenly
as
mashinka
finished
speaking
a
flood
of
hot
tears
burst
from
the
father
eyes
he
wiped
them
away
the
white
handkerchief
was
stained
with
crimson
spots
he
held
it
up
before
the
girl
eyes

in
hollow
tones
once
in
your
life
you
saw
a

weep
tears

sternly
after
a
pause
take

in

whither
are

asked
the
girl
back
again
to
the
sea
when
captain
von
ungern
with
his
child
and
mashinka
regained
the
deck
of
his
vessel
the
he
found
the
plenipotentiary
of
the
admiralty
already
on
board
that
official
was
charged
with
the
ukase
depriving
feodor
of
his
rank
and
appointing
his
brother
zeno
to
the
post
of
in
his
place
the
crew
were
looking
on
in
gloomy
silence
ready
for
any
turn
which
events
might
take
throw
both
ukase
and
messenger
into
the
sea
shouted
feodor
the
order
was
exactly
to
the
mind
of
the
crew
and
right
promptly
did
they
execute
it
and
now
he
called
out
which
of
you
will
come
with
me
wherever
i
may
go
we
will
all
go
with
you
against
hell
itself
shouted
the
men
nay
my
men
against
the
powers
of
hell
we
will
never
fight
but
only
against
those
of
heaven
and
earth
henceforth
we
will
league
ourselves
with
all
the
fiends
of
darkness
and
the
storm
the
weather
was
tempestuous
and
the
sea
was
running
high
not
until
the
following
day
did
the
admiralty
decide
to
pursue
the
vessel
which
had
vanished
so
suddenly
in
full
sail
it
was
then
too
late
to
overtake
her
it
was
shortly
afterwards
that
the
sad
news
reached
petersburg
that
the
fugitive
vessel
had
run
upon
the
rocks
of
dago
her
mainmast
and
bowsprit
were
all
that
was
ever
picked
up
so
it
was
plain
to
all
men
that
the
with
her
fifty
men
and
seven
guns
had
gone
to
the
bottom
so
after
all
men
said
things
had
perhaps
happened
as
they
ought
at
all
events
the
name
of
captain
feodor
von

was
utterly
forgotten

the
observatory
it
was
in
the
following
spring
that
the
lofty
tower
arose
on
the
promontory
of
the
isthmus
of
dago
the
building
was
quite
unnoticed
except
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
the
ordinary
track
of
vessels
was
then
far
distant
from
the
spot
at
that
time
the
island
of
dago
still
belonged
to
finland
although
under
swedish
rule
it
formed
a
small
republic
standing
by
itself
in
whose
internal
affairs
no
one
interfered
the
governor
of
the
island
had
of
course
made
inquiries
regarding
the
inhabitants
of
the
tower
and
had
learnt
that
they
were
foreign
seamen
whose
vessel
had
been
wrecked
in
the
neighbourhood
their
commander
was
reported
to
be
a
most
cultured
gentleman
capable
of
conversing
fluently
in
latin
as
well
as
in
dutch
he
had
purchased
the
whole
of
the
waste
promontory
from
the
authorities
of
the
island
with
hard
cash
and
had
then
had
the
stupendous
edifice
built
by
his
own
men
and
in
accordance
with
his
own
plans
when
it
was
completed
the
whole
company
lived
together
in
the
tower
how
many
of
them
there
might
be
was
never
exactly
known
for
they
never
showed
themselves
outside
their
fortress
walls
but
what
it
was
often
asked
could
be
the
occupation
of
the
men
within
that
however
was
a
mystery
to
the
islanders
but
the
mystery
of
mysteries
was
what
did
the
inmates
eat
for
to
build
such
a
tower
some
fifty
men
at
least
must
have
been
necessary
even
had
they
succeeded
in
bringing
all
their
provisions
to
land
from
their
stranded
vessel
these
must
have
been
consumed
in
a
very
short
time
they
had
already
been
living
there
a
whole
year
and
had
never
once
come
forth
from
their
rocky
retreat
to
buy
provisions
in
the
neighbouring
village
they
could
certainly
not
have
lived
on
and
mussels
alone
and
yet
their
rocks
produced
nothing
else
it
was
evident
nevertheless
that
they
possessed
abundance
of
money
for
in
summer
the
old
women
of
dago
but
never
the
young
girls
would
carry
great
baskets
of
fruit
and
flowers
to
the
locked
door
which
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
courtyard
of
the
tower
some
one
would
then
appear
in
response
to
their
knocking
open
a
small
window
in
the
door
receive
the
baskets
of
flowers
and
hand
out
real
money
in
exchange
for
them
no
that
was
no
spurious
coin
at
one
time
it
was
a
russian
imperial
at
another
an
english
sovereign
while
sometimes
it
was
german
thalers
and
spanish
dollars
intermixed
with
a
few
venetian
zecchini
that
were
given
in
payment
but
who
within
it
was
often
wondered
could
require
flowers
and
if
they
had
money
to
give
in
exchange
for
flowers
then
why
not
for
food
also
at
length
the
spiritual
overseer
of
the
island
the
very
reverend
jeremiah
waim≈ìner
resolved
to
ascertain
by
personal
inquiry
what
manner
of
men
really
dwelt
in
that
mysterious
edifice
with
this
object
he
one
day
made
bold
to
call
upon
its
proprietor
he
was
at
once
admitted
strange
to
say
although
he
came
quite
alone
his
eyes
were
not
even
bound
as
he
had
fully
convinced
himself
they
would
be
before
he
was
conducted
to
the
master
presence
he
was
allowed
to
look
all
around
and
see
everything
on
returning
home
there
would
be
absolutely
nothing
to
prevent
him
telling
everybody
that
the
tower
with
all
its
inner
staircases
was
built
of
massive
stone
and
that
it
was
divided
internally
into
very
many
stories
on
reaching
the
twelfth
story
the
reverend
gentleman
was
received
by
the
master
of
the
tower
this
portion
of
the
building
had
the
appearance
of
an
observatory
and
was
surmounted
by
a
lofty
dome
the
room
was
and
had
three
large
windows
looking
towards
the
sea
the
three
opposite
walls
being
covered
with
wainscot
everything
in
the
room
indicated
that
it
served
as
the
study
of
a
man
of
science
there
were
astronomical
instruments
musty
books
and
numerous
chemical
tubes
and
retorts
in
addition
there
were
all
kinds
of
superstitious
designs
alchemistic
abracadabras
and
symbols
in
which
no
man
of
sense
any
longer
believes
the
master
himself
was
a
personage
whose
features
never
betrayed
the
slightest
emotion
either
while
speaking
or
listening
he
requested
his
visitor
to
be
seated
beside
him
on
a
semicircular
bench
which
enclosed
a
sort
of
chemical
furnace
the
clergyman
introduced
himself
and
after
hinting
that
he
had
heard
of
the
master
great
love
for
science
observed
that
he
had
long
ardently
wished
to
make
his
acquaintance
as
science
was
his
own
darling
pursuit
they
might
be
able
he
suggested
to
exchange
ideas
to
their
mutual
advantage
the
master
hereupon
welcomed
him
warmly
as
a
guest
presently
he
pressed
a
secret
spring
and
a
bright
fire
suddenly
blazed
up
in
the
furnace
before
them
in
a
moment
the
master
had
drawn
forth
from
the
oven
a
supply
of
bread
meat
and
dried
figs
just
as
if
they
had
all
been
freshly
baked
and
prepared
within
he
then
turned
a
tap
in
another
part
of
the
same
apparatus
and
at
once
a
stream
of
fresh
foaming
beer
flowed
into
a
large
tankard
beneath
this
he
placed
with
the
other
good
things
on
the
table
before
his
guest
the
reverend
herr
waim≈ìner
convinced
himself
by
tasting
that
everything
was
really
what
it
appeared
to
be
but
tell
me
my
good
sir
he
exclaimed
in
astonishment
whence
do
you
procure
all
these
provisions
that
is
perfectly
simple
replied
the
master
gravely
everything
on
earth
as
you
know
is
produced
by
the
transformation
of
matter
the
alchemists
of
old
used
to
puzzle
their
brains
to
discover
how
to
make
stones
into
gold
but
i
have
solved
a
much
deeper
problem
than
that
how
to
make
the
rocks
into
bread
meat
and
fruit
and
the
waters
of
the
sea
into
sparkling
wine
and
foaming
beer
you
are
pleased
to
make
sport
of
me
i
see
said
the
clergyman
with
a
somewhat
sickly
smile
quite
the
contrary
my
friend
said
the
master
the
proof
is
before
you
beneath
and
around
me
as
you
see
there
is
nothing
but
rocks
and
water
as
you
know
i
have
not
stirred
from
this
spot
for
years
and
could
not
do
so
if
i
wished
for
i
have
no
vessel
yet
i
live
here
with
some
fifty
companions
without
asking
a
single
thing
from
any
one
on
your
island
besides
what
is
there
in
my
theory
that
is
incredible
are
not
the
constituents
of
bread
flesh
and
fruit
already
present
in
the
rocks
the
air
and
the
ocean
you
are
a
scientific
man
and
of
course
know
well
that
it
is
as
i
say
in
truth
the
only
secret
in
the
business
is
how
to
hasten
nature
tardy
process
of
the
transformation
of
matter
that
is
my
discovery
just
look
here
for
a
moment
in
this
vessel
you
see
a
black
sticky
fluid
you
may
tell
it
by
its
smell
it
is
tar
and
here
before
us
is
a
heated
furnace
now
every
chemist
knows
that
by
means
of
fire
and
he
can
produce
ice
i
now
place
the
vessel
in
the
flue
of
the
furnace
so
we
will
take
our
watches
in
our
hands
and
count
the
time
in
seconds
the
transformation
will
be
complete
let
us
open
the
aperture
look
at
the
dish
now
and
taste
it
too
it
is
a
pineapple
ice
illustration
it
is
a
pineapple
ice
a
shiver
ran
through
the
reverend
gentleman
whole
body
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
mysterious
delicacy
taste
it
never
he
cried
in
horror
such
things
are
not
to
be
done
without
the
help
of
the
foul
fiend
himself
without
that
indeed
it
were
impossible
said
the
master
calmly
everything
of
that
nature
is
done
only
with
the
aid
of
the
powers
of
darkness
but
my
friend
have
you
any
special
objection
to
them
have
i
any
objection
to
the
powers
of
darkness
exclaimed
the
horrified
ecclesiastic
ah
you
have
i
see
well
well
that
a
somewhat
antiquated
notion
a
relic
of
those
times
when
the
theory
prevailed
that
the
earth
was
governed
by
god
but
nowadays
we
have
changed
all
that
it
is
an
absolute
necessity
for
all
species
of
life
on
this
of
an
earthcrust
to
have
the
forces
of
hell
immediately
beneath
them
the
breath
of
heaven
chills
and
stiffens
everything
it
is
the
agents
of
satan
that
produce
everything
trees
fruit
beast
and
man
but
my
dear
sir
expostulated
the
clergyman
these
are
strange
geognostic
theories
notwithstanding
your
assertions
man
at
least
is
in
no
wise
the
work
of
satan
and
why
not
demanded
the
master
man
is
so
fashioned
that
he
must
freeze
to
death
unless
he
murder
some
other
brute
that
happens
to
have
a
fur
skin
to
appease
his
hunger
also
he
must
slay
some
other
animal
and
his
thirst
does
he
not
even
thirst
for
the
blood
of
his
fellow
man
of
his
own
brother
could
such
a
monster
think
you
be
fashioned
in
any
other
region
than
the
place
of
perdition
itself
but
you
forget
the
human
virtues
interrupted
the
ecclesiastic
there
are
many
men
you
will
admit
who
rule
their
whole
lives
by
the
law
of
heaven
of
all
things
that
surely
is
the
most
opposed
to
nature
those
laws
of
which
you
speak
have
been
made
merely
to
torment
the
human
race
the
virtues
are
simply
so
many
revolts
against
nature
that
alone
is
good
which
satisfies
the
body
and
the
soul
my
dear
sir
what
of
the
immortal
soul
said
the
minister
solemnly
the
soul
echoed
the
master
contemptuously
the
most
execrable
imposture
with
which
the
world
has
ever
been
befooled
for
the
torment
a
tyrant
was
invented
to
chastise
it
by
means
of
fasting
and
renunciation
thus
to
reduce
it
to
desperation
the
soul
sir
is
simply
a
tyrant
that
forces
its
monstrous
feelings
on
the
body
and
we
are
to
suffer
thus
merely
because
that
tyrannous
fiction
comes
from
above
from
heaven
and
the
body
from
beneath
from
hell
but
how
if
it
were
to
occur
to
the
body
that
it
is
really
the
master
and
the
other
the
slave
and
the
soul
were
to
be
trodden
under
foot
sir
your
dogma
seems
to
me
perfectly
frightful
said
herr
waim≈ìner
aghast
i
prosper
well
enough
under
it
however
my
whole
confession
of
faith
indeed
is
contained
in
these
words
which
is
agreeable
to
me
is
right
that
which
is
hurtful
to
another
is
not
wrong
sir
do
your
companions
all
practise
this
religion
also
i
preach
them
no
other
and
they
appear
quite
content
with
it
have
you
a
family
also
asked
the
clergyman
anxiously
i
sincerely
trust
not
oh
yes
answered
the
master
lightly
there
dwell
with
me
both
a
female
anthropopithecus
and
an
undeveloped
specimen
of
the
and
what
religion
pray
do
you
teach
your
son
the
same
that
i
have
just
enunciated
the
reverend
gentleman
raised
his
hands
in
righteous
horror
then
after
fervently
murmuring
the
first
lines
of
luther
hymn
a
safe
stronghold
our
god
is
still
he
rose
to
go
farewell
sir
said
he
never
again
can
i
come
here
when
i
reach
home
i
shall
at
once
make
a
representation
to
our
authorities
to
compel
you
to
build
up
your
exit
on
the
island
side
so
that
you
and
yours
may
never
come
forth
to
trouble
and
contaminate
our
people
fear
not
friend
said
the
master
calmly
and
emphatically
we
never
shall
go
out
to
trouble
you
but
it
will
not
be
long
ere
you
come
here
to
us
listen
in
this
very
year
a
famine
will
visit
your
island
i
have
learnt
as
much
already
from
those
demons
of
mine
ay
and
your
people
will
come
crawling
on
their
knees
to
me
who
possess
the
power
to
turn
the
rocks
into
bread
and
they
will
sing
satanas
in
chorus
the
clergyman
pulled
his
gown
over
his
ears
in
order
to
shut
out
such
blasphemy
and
rushed
precipitately
down
stairs
and
out
at
the
lower
door
never
again
had
he
the
least
inclination
to
pay
a
further
pastoral
visit
to
the
satanic
apostle

chapter
iv
the
sorcerer
the
master
of

tower

spoke
the
truth
it
was
really
the
powers
of
darkness
that
helped
him
to
make
the
rocks
and
water
into
bread
and
wine
he
also
stated
a
simple
fact
when
he
declared
that
the
agent
in
the
transformation
was
the
furnace
in
the
observatory
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
it
was
in
the
following
manner
that
this
work
of
sorcery
was
accomplished
on
a
day
when
the
position
of
the
barometer
and
the
cries

announced
the
approach
of
a
storm
the
apostle
of

assembled
his
companions
in
a
subterranean
chamber
of
his
tower
this
vault
was
called
the
chapel
it
contained
a
pulpit
from
which
the
master
himself
was
in
the
habit
of
exhorting
his
flock
it
was
indeed
a
strange
chapel
and
what
frightful
exhortations
were
these
exhortations
to
the
perpetration
of
all
manner
of
misdeeds
and
cruelty
the
ten

perpetual
enmity
towards

especially
towards

its

aloft
as
a

faithlessness

treachery

highest
duty
and
the
malediction
of
the
world
the
most
perfect
bliss
such
was
the
gospel
of
dago
while
the
master
uttered
these
doctrines
his
little
son
sat
on
the
pulpit
steps
at
his
feet
so
that
he
might
early
imbibe
the
frightful
precepts
in
all
childish
simplicity
and
continue
their
propagation
when
his
father
should
have
gone
to
his
own
place
the
song
of
praise
was
never
raised
in

hold
high
festival
upon
this
announcement
being
made
the
inmates
hastened
to
bring
their
small
boats
out
of
their
concealment
in
the
vault
these
vessels
were
constructed
to
hold
three
men
each
and
were
made
of
light
wood
covered
with
stout
leather
they
were
then
placed
in
readiness
in
a
narrow
creek
leading
from
the
vault
out
into
the
open
sea
as
the
storm
at
length
began
to
break
the
men
were
certain
to
be
sitting
ready
in
their
boats
awaiting
the
expected
sacrifice
and
as
certainly
it
came
as
night
began
to
fall
the
master
ascended
alone
to
the
observatory
he
at
once
lighted
the
furnace
and
heightened
its
brilliancy
by
means
of
lime
and
oxygen
he
then
removed
the
wainscot
from
the
three
walls
opposite
the
large
windows
facing
the
sea
behind
the
wainscot
were
immense
concave
mirrors
of
burnished
steel
these
now
reflected
back
the
dazzling
light
from
the
furnace
in
three
directions
away
to
the
distant
horizon
before
the
exercises
of
the
night
it
was
customary
to
ring
the
chapel
bell
this
was
an
enormous
bell
which
had
once
been
taken
as
booty
it
was
suspended
in
a
secret
chamber
beneath
the
observatory
and
on
being
rung
its
rumbling
notes
sounded
through
a
semicircular
window
of
the
tower
far
out
into
the
night
the
tower
had
no
opening
on
the
land
side
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
could
neither
see
the
light
of
the
furnace
nor
hear
the
tolling
of
the
bell
every
ship
which
appeared
on
the
horizon
in
a
stormy
night
must
inevitably
fall
a
prey
to
this
diabolical
stratagem
in
the
channel
connecting
the
baltic
with
the
gulf
of
finland
there
were
two
lighthouses
one
on
the
swedish
coast
at
gustavsvarn
and
another
on
the
finnish
coast
near
revel
even
on
a
stormy
night
seamen
might
easily
have
steered
their
course
by
these
two
lights
but
the
devil
apostle
in
the
tower
of
dago
confused
them
with
his
light
and
the
sound
of
his
bell
the
mariners
imagined
that
one
of
the
two
lighthouses
known
to
them
lay
before
them
they
felt
sure
that
the
light
beckoned
them
on
to
safety
so
with
heartfelt
thanks
to
god
for
his
mercy
they
steered
directly
towards
it
and
about
an
hour
later
were
dashed
against
the
rocks
of
dago
then
as
signals
for
help
and
cries
of
terror
rose
above
the
roar
of
wind
and
sea
the
small
boats
swarmed
forth
from
their
concealment
and
boarded
the
stranded
vessel
the
crews
killed
all
who
were
still
alive
on
board
and
plundered
everything
of
value
to
be
found
money
bales
of
goods
and
provisions
they
then
carried
everything
ashore
and
stored
it
in
the
lower
vaults
of
the
tower
such
an
expedition
would
often
have
to
be
repeated
twice
or
thrice
in
a
single
night
for
the
deceptive
light
enticed
vessels
from
three
different
quarters
and
all
went
into
the
trap
the
master
was
careful
to
extinguish
the
light
about
two
hours
before
daybreak
in
order
that
no
vessel
should
make
towards
his
stronghold
in
broad
daylight
of
his
victims
not
one
man
was
ever
left
alive
they
had
indeed
leagued
themselves
with
all
the
fiends
of
darkness
and
the
storm
in
defiance
of
both
heaven
and
earth
this
then
was
the
sorcery
by
which
they
drew
bread
meat
wine
and
fruit
from
the
rocks
and
the
sea
it
was
the
stranded
vessels
that
filled
the
chambers
and
vaults
of
the
tower
of
dago
with
everything
dear
to
the
heart
of
man
and
covered
the
rocky
shore
beneath
the
tower
with
that
which
was
now
dearest
of
all
to
its
hearts
the
fleshless
bones
of
their
brother
men

chapter
v
the
famine
it
came
to
pass
as
the
master
of
the
tower
of
dago
had
foretold
a
year
of
famine
visited
the
island
there
in
his
loneliness
he
had
taken
continual
counsel
of
that
great
vital
principle
which
he
chose
to
associate
with
the
prince
of
evil
but
to
which
the
learned
give
the
name
of
g√¶a
earth
and
the
has
in
truth
diabolical
humours
between
earth
and
her
minions
and
the
favourites
of
heaven
there
is
eternal
strife
it
pleases
earth
to
let
the
ill
weeds
grow
the
poppy
and
the
are
her
darlings
and
yet
that
child
of
heaven
finer
nature
forces
her
to
bring
forth
white
wheat
for
him
the
favours
the
savage
and
grosser
instincts
while
man
does
her
violence
by
pressing
upon
her
his
nobler
fruits
and
virtues
man
doubtless
has
a
right
to
ask
why
has
the
creator
brought
forth
these
myriads
of
caterpillars
and
cockchafers
that
devastate
my
but
surely
the
caterpillar
and
the
cockchafer
have
an
equal
right
to
demand
to
what
purpose
has
earth
given
birth
to
that
misshapen
creature
that
delights
to
sweep
me
down
from
my
tree
and
trample
me
under
foot
but
after
all
the

not
the

rather
the
caterpillar
the
hermit
in
the
tower
of
dago
included
in
his
studies
that
centre
of
the
other
infernos
the
sun
he
had
observed
that
the
spots
and
eruptions
on
the
sun
disc
exercise
an
influence
upon
the
weather
of
our
planet
he
had
moreover
imbibed
the
wisdom
of
the
wind
and
waves
he
had
carefully
noted
the
migrations
of
whales
and
kingfishers
as
well
as
the
displays
of
the
aurora
borealis
and
the
shooting
stars
all
these
had
told
him
that
the
hot
days
of
may
which
so
quicken
the
growth
of
the
crops
would
be
succeeded
by
a
frost
that
would
blight
utterly
the
whole
field
produce
of
the
island
of
dago
in
a
single
night
and
so
it
happened
not
on
that
island
alone
but
throughout
the
whole
of
northern
russia
the
hopes
of
the
agriculturists
were
shattered
by
that
terrible
frost
the
capricious
weather
brought
in
its
train
that
pestilence
which
attacks
only
the
poor
starvation
in
such
circumstances
larger
and
more
powerful
states
may
easily
procure
money
and
tide
over
the
evil
day
by
purchasing
grain
in
lands
more
blessed
than
theirs
and
distributing
it
among
their
people
but
a
small
and
republic
like
the
island
of
dago
could
not
so
easily
get
gold
and
silver
to
give
in
exchange
for
bread
the
poor
people
had
to
fall
back
upon
such
nutriment
as
fish
and
cheese
this
year
they
said
we
must
eat
no
bread
that
was
the
solution
the
old
women
of
the
island
now
came
much
more
frequently
to
the
tower
to
sell
their
flowers
but
instead
of
gold
they
now
begged
for
a
little
corn
listen
to
me
said
the
master
of
the
tower
to
them
one
day
you
want
bread
well
i
know
a
secret
which
enables
me
to
transform
earth
at
once
into
corn
and
barley
bring
me
earth
then
but
rich
and
fertile
it
must
be
and
i
will
give
you
corn
in
exchange
for
it
however
large
the
sack
may
be
in
which
you
bring
the
clods
just
so
large
will
be
the
sack
of
corn
i
will
give
you
in
return
at
first
it
was
only
the
women
that
made
the
trial
they
brought
the
magician
good
dark
loam
in
small
sacks
for
this
they
received
a
like
quantity
of
wheat
the
grain
was
such
as
they
had
never
before
seen
at
once
the
strong
young
men
were
seized
with
the
desire
to
participate
in
such
profitable
barter
and
soon
they
too
were
carrying
to
the
tower
as
heavy
sacks
of
mother
earth
as
their
brawny
arms
and
broad
shoulders
could
support
the
very
reverend
pastor
waim≈ìner
did
indeed
pronounce
his
anathema
against
all
who
dared
to
make
such
pilgrimages
to
the
satanic
shrine
in
order
to
barter
their
own
blessed
earth
for
a
stranger
accursed
corn
he
warned
them
that
grain
grown
in
such
a
mysterious
and
suspicious
soil
could
not
but
give
them
the
itch
and
elflock
and
that
one
day
their
souls
must
inevitably
sink
for
ever
in
the
pool
of
fire
his
threats
and
warnings
however
were
of
no
avail
the
skins
did
not
turn
black
with
eating
the
mysterious
corn
neither
did
their
hair
become
entangled
their
souls
welfare
they
therefore
reasoned
might
well
be
equally
secure
the
grain
was
in
fact
the
best
ever
reaped
in
brandenburg
the
russian
government
had
had
it
shipped
for
their
northern
ports
that
year
so
many
vessels
had
gone
on
the
rocks
beneath
the
tower
of
dago
that
its
inmates
had
soon
no
more
room
to
store
the
booty
thus
it
was
that
they
came
to
exchange
it
with
the
islanders
for
earth
earth
but
for
what
purpose
could
the
destroying
spirit
require
earth
to
create
illustration
there
was
a
little
hollow
on
the
south
side
of
the
tower
which
was
sheltered
from
the
wind
on
every
side
this
hollow
the
master
filled
with
the
earth
and
planted
the
little
plot
all
over
with
flowers
in
this
way
he
soon
had
a
perfect
laid
out
there
was
then
one
human
being
in
the
tower
who
took
pleasure
in
flowers
but
did
the
terrible
doctrines
professed
by
the
master
permit
him
to
act
thus
kindly
towards
any
living
creature
alas
nothing
in
creation
is
flawless
not
even
the
satanic
confession
of
faith
even
satan
is
sometimes
tricked
by
his
disciples
and
unbelief
itself
has
its
hypocrisy
to
his
own
thinking
this
man
had
succeeded
in
banishing
every
human
feeling
from
his
heart
but
this
one
still
remained
he
had
he
thought
been
able
to
renounce
every
virtue
in
favour
of
its
opposite
vice
but
this
one
he
could
not
renounce
he
could
not
fight
down
the
kindliness
that
filled
his
heart
for
the
poor
girl
mashinka
who
had
saved
his
child
who
had
accompanied
him
into
exile
and
who
had
become
a
loving
mother
to
his
boy
and
a
devoted
companion
to
him
so
he
felt
grateful
to
her
but
that
was
surely
a
heresy
against
the
religion
he
professed
and
preached
a
positive
breach
of
the
dogma
for
gratitude
is
itself
a
virtue
and
closely
related
to
love
gratitude
being
merely
a
tyranny
of
the
soul
over
the
body
how
could
the
body
which
had
now
become
master
admit
it
and
if
the
body
be
indeed
the
ruling
lord
the
right
of
thought
also
belongs
to
it
its
philosophy
must
then
determine
the
course
of
both
action
and
feeling
was
it
not
plain
that
this
one
contradiction
in
the
master
principles
might
nay
must
overturn
the
whole
edifice
of
babel
nevertheless
the
master
found
it
impossible
to
shut
his
heart
against
this
one
feeling
with
the
most
painstaking
art
he
had
laid
out
this
garden
bought
at
a
higher
price
even
than
the
gardens
of
semiramis
and
that
too
for
a
poor
peasant
girl
who
alone
in
that
babel
of
hate
had
retained
in
her
heart
the
priceless
feeling
of
love
when
the
garden
was
finished
and
planted
with
all
the
flowers
the
island
could
afford
the
master
led
mashinka
to
the
door
which
had
hitherto
been
closed
to
her
opened
it
and
said
simply
the
garden
is
yours
illustration
the
garden
is
yours
and
as
the
girl
weeping
with
joy
threw
herself
at
his
feet
pressed
his
hand
to
her
lips
and
covered
it
with
her
tears
did
not
the
captive
spirit
throb
rebelliously
within
its
weak
bodily
prison
and
ask
is
not
a
single
tear
like
these
a
single
cry
of
joy
sweeter
far
than
a
sea
of
blood
and
a
chorus
of
from
the
throats
of
thousands
of
vanquished
enemies
at
the
thought
he
pushed
the
girl
away
from
him
and
rushed
up
to
his
laboratory

continue

day

fiendish
festivals
the

little
son
came
into
room
he
had
just
come
up
from

underground
chapel
the
face
looked
sorely
troubled

mashinka
asked
what
ailed
him

me
so
sad
what
it
is

not
tell

this
at

i

mashinka
took
the
boy
cold
hand
in
hers
and
tried
to
soothe
away
the
pain
that
filled
his
heart
she
taught
him
how
he
ought
to
love
both
his
heavenly
and
his
earthly
father
even
though
both
should
chastise
their
child
so
severely
that
love
was
moved
to
give
place
to

evil
seeds

the
meeting
this
terrible
life
had
now
gone
on
for
twelve
long
years
most
of
the
actors
in
the
drama
had
become
grey
several
had
died
and
the
total
number
in
the
tower
had
now
fallen
to
forty
even
the
of
dago
had
hair
and
seemed
some
twenty
years
older
than
he
really
was
during
that
time
some
six
hundred
vessels
had
been
shattered
on
the
rocks
of
dago
some
eighteen
thousand
men
had
perished
and
a
fortune
of
a
hundred
millions
of
thalers
had
been
destroyed
but
still
the
demon
of
revenge
and
destruction
was
unsatisfied
twelve
years
of
blood
had
not
sufficed
to
quench
the
fire
of
hate
that
consumed
his
heart
all
those
whose
bodies
lay
scattered
among
the
rocks
beneath
him
were
men
quite
unknown
to
him
he
never
even
learnt
their
names
nor
was
he
present
when
they
were
struck
down
but
one
thing
he
still
yearned
for
of
one
thing
he
was
ever
dreaming
his
sole
remaining
wish
was
to
hold
in
his
destroying
power
those
who
had
made
him
so
miserable
to
meet
them
for
a
moment
face
to
face
then
to
drink
in
the
curses
of
their
despair
as
they
were
thrust
down
into
their
graves
that
indeed
would
be
the
very
crown
of
his
during
summer
the
work
was
discontinued
in
northern
regions
lighthouses
are
of
little
service
in
the
short
and
light
summer
nights
during
these
months
of
inactivity
the
master
as
became
a
dutiful
father
instructed
his
son
in
all
those
arts
whereby
the
mighty
powers
of
nature
are
made
serviceable
to
man
he
exercised
him
also
in
the
use
of
arms
not
in
true
knightly
fashion
but
with
all
the
tricks
approved
of
bandits
and
corsairs
he
took
the
boy
with
him
in
his
boat
among
the
reefs
along
the
shore
so
that
he
should
learn
early
to
be
reckless
and
defiant
of
all
danger
many
a
time
he
would
throw
the
lad
from
the
boat
right
out
into
the
eddy
at
first
he
was
unable
to
get
out
without
help
and
then
the
father
would
leap
in
after
him
and
bring
him
back
by
the
hair
of
the
head
in
a
little
time
however
the
lad
was
expert
enough
to
dispense
with
all
help
and
would
swim
in
and
out
of
the
most
dangerous
positions
alone
about
the
end
of
autumn
in
the
twelfth
year
an
imperial
russian
gunboat
was
wrecked
upon
the
rocks
of
dago
among
the
papers
found
in
the
cabin
by
the
plunderers
was
an
admiralty
order
addressed
to
all
the
commanders
of
war
vessels
this
document
stated
that
during
the
past
twelve
years
a
vast
number
of
maritime
disasters
had
occurred
in
the
baltic
and
particularly
so
at
least
it
was
believed
in
the
passage
between
faro
and
gustavsvarn
as
not
a
single
soul
was
known
to
have
survived
the
general
voice
of
terror
and
exasperation
had
at
length
decided
the
ruling
powers
to
move
in
the
matter
the
order
went
on
to
express
the
opinion
that
these
seas
must
be
the
haunt
of
some
piratical
vessel
which
captured
ships
in
stormy
nights
and
sent
them
to
the
bottom
after
slaughtering
their
crews
for
strangely
enough
no
one
had
ever
found
a
single
fragment
of
any
of
the
missing
vessels
seamen
it
was
stated
were
in
the
habit
when
a
disaster
was
imminent
of
committing
a
short
account
of
the
catastrophe
to
the
waves
in
a
sealed
bottle
which
in
all
likelihood
would
one
day
be
picked
up
by
fishermen
but

some
six
hundred
missing
vessels
no
such
memorial
had
ever
made
its
appearance
human
hands
it
was
therefore
concluded
must
be
at
work
and
search
for
them
must
be
diligently
made
the
document
therefore
required
the
commander
of
every
and
gunboat
to
take
every
possible
step
to
track
out
the
mysterious
destroyer
how
the
apostle
of
dago
laughed
sardonically
as
he
read
the
order
so
they
are
coming
at
last
he
cried
those
for
whom
i
have
waited
so
long
right
well
shall
they
be
received
at
that
season
of
the
year
dense
fogs
begin
to
be
prevalent
in
the
baltic
these
are
of
the
utmost
danger
to
seamen
for
the
rays
from
the
lighthouses
can
not
penetrate
the
atmosphere
and
the
attention
of
vessels
can
only
be
attracted
by
the
sound
of
bells
on
one
such
hazy
and
sultry
night
the
master
of
the
tower
of
dago
rang
the
bell
for
evening
service
that
night
surely
they
should
hold
high
festival
vessels
of
war
were
certainly
scouring
the
seas
all
around
one
such
vessel
was
still
wanting
on
the
rocks
of
dago
smaller
ships
such
as
gunboats
brigs
and
corvettes
were
lying
there
in
plenty
forming
excellent
places
of
retreat
for
the
hydra
and
nautilus
to
them
the
company
of
a
full
could
not
but
be
welcome
presently
in
response
to
the
sounds
which
had
so
often
proved
a
mariner
an
answering
signal
was
borne
in
from
the
open
sea
it
was
the
familiar
tones
of
a
great
which
can
be
heard
many
miles
off
in
foggy
weather
they
were
coming
then
at
last
only
a
little
while
ago
no
doubt
they
had
thought
that
they
had
lost
their
way
but
now
thank
god
they
were
sailing
towards
a
safe
harbour
by
daybreak
they
should
be
beyond
all
danger
not
god
in
heaven
can
save
them
now
muttered
the
master
as
with
such
thoughts
he
gazed
intently
into
the
gloom
but
nevertheless
it
appeared
that
he
could
save
them
just
as
the
approaching
sound
of
the
indicated
that
the
vessel
could
now
be
scarcely
a
mile
distant
from
the
tower
the
fog
suddenly
lifted
and
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
disclosed
the
outline
of
a
ship
of
the
line
she
immediately
dropped
her
anchor
for
now
that
the
fog
had
cleared
the
seamen
perceived
the
danger
of
their
position
and
arrested
their
vessel
course
and
that
not
a
moment
too
soon
she
about
a
gunshot
from
the
tower
and
presently
hoisted
the
russian
colours
in
response
the
master
of
the
tower
at
once
saluted
her
by
running
up
the
corresponding
flag
the
vessel
was
now
lowered
the
commodore
a
midshipman
and
four
and
twenty
marines
and
seamen
took
their
places
all
were
fully
armed
they
steered
for
the
entrance
facing
the
sea
although
well
concealed
they
had
soon
discovered
it
with
the
aid
of
their
powerful
glasses
they
succeeded
in
making
their
way
safely
through
all
the
rocks
and
breakers
which
threatened
their
approach
the
strangers
were
received
at
the
lower
door
by
an
old
porter
who
was
to
all
appearance
nearly
stone
deaf
the
commodore
had
to
shout
with
all
his
might
into
the
fellow
ears
before
he
could
be
made
to
hear
anything
then
he
gave
an
answer
of
which
not
a
word
could
be
understood
for
the
old
man
spoke
the
purest
by
means
of
signs
however
he
at
length
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
the
only
servant
in
the
establishment
and
that
if
the
gentlemen
would
like
to
speak
to
any
one
they
might
go
upstairs
and
see
mynheer
illustration
the
commodore
ordered
his
men
to
land
and
the
entire
company
then
followed
the
old
porter
at
each
door
which
they
passed
on
their
way
the
officer
took
the
precaution
of
stationing
two
armed
men
when
he
reached
the
observatory
floor
only
the
coxswain
and
the
midshipman
the
latter
quite
a
lad
remained
with
him
but
these
were
evidently
more
than
sufficient
for
the
master
of
the
tower
was
quite
alone
in
his
study
and
had
beside
him
no
other
weapons
than
those
of
science
the
commodore
saluted
him
in
good
french
you
are
the
master
of
this
tower
i
believe
at
present
indeed
i
am
and
for
what
purpose
did
you
have
it
built
pray
the
master
glanced
sharply
at
his
questioner
may
i
first
inquire
said
he
what
entitles
you
to
ask
such
a
question
you
shall
hear
replied
the
officer
you
see
of
course
by
my
uniform
that
i
am
commodore
on
a
ship
of
the
line
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
the
tsar
of
all
the
russias
the
lying
out
there
is
my
vessel
the
of
late
years
an
enormous
number
of
ships
have
been
lost
in
the
baltic
and
that
in
the
most
mysterious
circumstances
i
have
therefore
received
orders
to
stop
and
search
every
suspicious
vessel
on
the
high
seas
as
well
as
to
make
any
investigations
upon
the
coast
which
i
may
consider
advisable
my
name
is
count
zeno
von
ungern
surely
the
master
features
must
long
ago
have
assumed
the
repose
of
death
itself
not
to
have
been
convulsed
with
every
evil
passion
at
the
very
mention
of
that
name
the
worst
passion
of
all
being
joy
it
was
his
brother
who
stood
before
him
the
two
sons
had
never
seen
each
other
since
their
earliest
childhood
zeno
had
visited
his
elder
brother
house
only
in
feodor
absence
at
sea
while
feodor
had
never
once
appeared
in
the
brilliant
salons
of
the
court
the
elder
brother
moreover
now
looked
much
older
than
he
really
was
it
was
impossible
therefore
for
zeno
to
recognise
him
feodor
acknowledged
his
visitor
mission
with
a
polite
bow
i
am
delighted
he
said
to
have
this
pleasure
my
name
is
baron
helmford
ah
a
swede
my
ancestors
may
have
been
so
i
am
from
friesland
and
for
what
purpose
do
you
live
here
i
live
here
answered
the
master
calmly
mainly
for
scientific
pursuits
there
is
indeed
he
added
hesitatingly
another
reason
as
well
but
one
which
after
all
i
have
really
little
reason
to
conceal
from
you
why
then
do
you
not
inform
me
of
it
at
once
because
a
child
might
also
hear
it
the
master
here
glanced
significantly
at
the
young
midshipman
who
was
also
in
the
room
oh
that
is
my
son
paul
said
the
commodore
with
fatherly
pride
he
is
anything
but
a
child
he
is
a
midshipman
on
his
majesty
ship
the
and
has
already
been
through
many
a
deadly
fray
i
do
not
doubt
it
and
yet
he
can
hardly
be
more
than
ah
thirteen
years
old
that
is
in
fact
exactly
his
age
i
also
have
a
son
said
the
master
he
is
sixteen
years
of
age
and
he
too
has
seen
and
heard
many
fearful
things
but
one
thing
you
know
he
must
not
hear
tales
in
which
a
woman
ah
you
are
right
said
the
commodore
hastily
if
it
is
a
question
of
that
sort
i
need
ask
no
more
now
commodore
if
you
wish
it
i
will
myself
show
you
all
the
rooms
and
passages
in
the
building
be
good
enough
to
accompany
me
feodor
led
the
way
down
the
stone
steps
connecting
one
floor
with
another
the
smallness
of
the
rooms
into
which
each
story
was
divided
easily
made
the
stranger
imagine
that
he
was
seeing
the
whole
of
the
space
between
the
walls
whereas
he
really
saw
only
about
of
it
a
vertical
partition
running
from
the
vaults
beneath
up
to
the
upper
story
shut
off
a
portion
of
the
space
it
was
here
that
all
the
plundered
treasure
ammunition
and
guns
were
carefully
concealed
through
this
section
a
secret
passage
led
down
to
the
rooms
in
which
the
provisions
were
stored
and
to
the
subterranean
chapel
in
which
the
armed
men
were
hidden
waiting
for
the
signal
to
force
their
way
by
means
of
a
into
the
upper
portions
of
the
tower
the
living
rooms
through
which
the
commodore
was
conducted
had
quite
the
appearance
of
such
as
might
be
used
by
some
contemplative
and
learned
recluse
they
contained
naturalists
collections
and
corals
antiquities
and
filled
with
folios
presently
the
officer
glanced
out
of
a
window
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
saw
away
beneath
him
the
flower
garden
with
the
asters
and
chrysanthemums
blooming
in
the
autumn
sun
ah
he
exclaimed
that
garden
tells
plainly
enough
that
this
tower
has
also
a
mistress
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
can
not
conduct
you
thither
count
von
ungern
said
the
master
we
should
have
to
pass
through
the
lady
boudoir
the
lady
is
your
wife
is
she
not
inquired
the
commodore
it
is
ill
answering
that
question
yes
and
yet
no
ah
a
secret
i
perceive
yes
count
but
to
show
you
that
the
secret
is
in
no
way
a
suspicious
one
i
will
make
a
suggestion
where
a
man
may
not
enter
a
guest
who
is
still
a
child
may
fitly
enough
be
seen
so
saying
he
opened
a
door
and
called
alexander
in
response
a
tall
sunburnt
lad
stepped
from
the
adjacent
room
his
face
betrayed
much
perplexity
upon
perceiving
the
strangers
feodor
gently
pushed
him
towards
the
younger
youth
see
he
said
this
is
count
paul
von
ungern
a
midshipman
take
him
with
you
to
see
your
mother
and
be
sure
that
you
make
good
friends
with
each
other
alexander
gazed
in
wonder
with
his
great
dark
eyes
first
at
his
father
and
then
at
the
strange
lad
he
then
silently
held
out
his
hand
to
paul
drew
him
towards
him
and
embraced
him
finally
he
linked
his
arm
in
paul
and
led
him
away
to
see
his
mother
the
frank
wonder
expressed
by
the
boy
flushed
face
quite
disarmed
the
commodore
suspicions
he
began
to
believe
that
after
all
those
walls
might
merely
conceal
the
secret
of
some
tragedy
of
passion
one
might
well
have
grounds
he
imagined
for
shutting
oneself
off
from
the
world
along
with
a
woman
whose
face
no
one
might
look
upon
except
a
child
no
older
than
the
tower
itself
and
yet
had
he
but
known
it
the
woman
might
have
been
safely
seen
by
any
one
on
earth
except
zeno
von
ungern
alone
had
he
seen
her
he
must
at
once
have
recognised
the
nurse
of
his
brother
child
the
girl
he
had
so
often
seen
when
visiting
feodor
castle
the
features
of
women
too
do
not
alter
like
those
of
men
had
zeno
seen
her
therefore
he
must
at
once
have
guessed
who
the
master
of
the
tower
really
was
the
party
had
just
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
the
little
table
was
laid
and
luncheon
was
ready
a
small
cask
of
fresh
beer
stood
tapped
on
the
floor
everything
seemed
most
inviting
we
might
perhaps
remain
here
suggested
the
master
your
coxswain
can
examine
the
other
rooms
and
the
stores
there
is
nothing
very
remarkable
about
them
my
old
porter
will
open
all
the
lockfast
places
for
him
he
can
then
report
the
result
of
his
inspection
on
his
return
he
laughed
lightly
as
he
concluded
and
the
commodore
laughed
also
their
laughter
seemed
to
be
echoed
by
the
voices
of
the
two
boys
which
sounded
from
the
garden
below
as
count
zeno
again
looked
down
through
the
window
he
saw
that
the
lads
were
playing
together
they
were
having
a
trial
of
strength
the
clear
voice
of
a
woman
which
seemed
to
sound
through
an
open
door
admonished
them
to
be
careful
not
to
injure
each
other
but
she
apparently
did
not
dream
of
admonishing
them
for
trampling
down
all
her
flowers
in
their
struggles
as
he
looked
on
at
the
havoc
caused
by
the
lads
count
zeno
could
not
but
feel
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
tower
appeared
to
be
quite
the
most
hospitable
and
complaisant
people
he
had
ever
met
illustration
chapter
viii
reconciliation
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
since
the
joys
of
his
earliest
childhood
feodor
son
alexander
experienced
a
real
pleasure
it
was
now
when
pointing
to
mashinka
he
was
able
to
say
to
his
guest
see
here
is
my
mother
for
to
him
she
was
really
so
since
his
earliest
years
this
woman
had
indeed
filled
a
mother
place
to
him
his
real
mother
had
now
other
cares
this
woman
alone
loved
him
from
her
alone
he
had
learnt
that
there
should
be
any
other
feeling
than
anger
and
hate
on
earth
still
greater
however
was
his
pleasure
as
he
presented
his
guest
look
mother
he
cried
this
is
paul
paul
von
ungern
father
told
me
to
bring
him
to
see
you
he
said
we
were
to
be
good
friends
tears
were
glistening
in
his
eyes
for
well
he
knew
who
this
paul
von
ungern
really
was
there
was
in
fact
one
secret
which
mashinka
had
never
disclosed
to
feodor
during
all
these
years
this
same
paul
she
well
knew
had
already
entered
the
world
when
the
great
catastrophe
overcame
her
master
it
was
indeed
mainly
this
boy
birth
which
had
caused
the
catastrophe
two
people
whom
a
sinful
passion
had
made
to
fall
had
their
reasons
for
preventing
feodor
from
learning
their
guilt
the
woman
having
committed
the
first
fault
was
compelled
to
conceal
it
with
fresh
sins
the
husband
therefore
had
never
learnt
this
secret
in
an
hour
of
confidence
however
when
the
boy
had
fled
to
her
in
horror
from
the
frightful
teachings
of
his
father
mashinka
had
told
young
alexander
the
truth
under
her
breath
she
told
him
that
he
had
mighty
enemies
in
that
world
which
had
vanished
from
him
in
childhood
that
they
were
his
uncle
and
his
uncle
son
a
it
was
because
of
them
she
told
him
that
he
was
compelled
to
waste
away
his
life
in
that
dreary
rocky
fortress
but
she
also
taught
him
that
it
was
the
duty
of
good
men
who
wish
to
please
god
to
forgive
their
enemies
and
taught
him
too
a
simple
prayer
which
a
good
man
might
pray
for
his
enemies
a
prayer
that
god
might
turn
their
hearts
that
they
might
cease
from
persecuting
him
and
that
they
should
become
reconciled
with
him
free
him
from
that
life
of
captivity
and
once
more
hold
out
to
him
the
hand
of
friendship
she
had
taught
him
even
to
pray
for
the
welfare
of
that
brother
who
from
his
very
birth
had
unwittingly
been
the
boy
persecutor
so
now
that
he
was
able
to
say
to
mashinka
look
here
is
paul
von
ungern
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
these
words
said
simultaneously
my
prayer
has
at
length
been
answered
my
enemy
is
reconciled
and
has
come
to
free
me
and
god
is
indeed
good
and
so
is
my
father
now
i
can
love
both
god
and
my
father
yes
and
my
enemy
also
mashinka
understood
the
boy
thoughts
well
she
threw
her
arms
round
both
their
necks
and
kissed
them
yes
yes
she
said
smiling
you
must
indeed
be
good
friends
she
then
brought
forth
from
her
cupboard
a
host
of
dainties
and
spread
quite
a
little
feast
for
them
while
partaking
of
this
paul
began
to
tell
alexander
of
the
great
world
of
adventure
so
well
known
to
him
and
of
his
frequent
encounters
with
the
pirates
of
the
northern
seas
here
it
occurred
to
alexander
that
the
swordsmanship
of
pirates
is
distinguished
by
its
peculiar
cuts
and
thrusts
with
the
exercise
of
which
he
was
but
too
familiar
he
therefore
brought
out
his
weapons
and
gave
paul
some
lessons
in
these
useful
devices
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
put
them
into
practice
if
he
should
again
find
himself
in
any
piratical
fray
how
happy
he
felt
in
having
for
once
the
companionship
of
a
lad
like
himself
a
true
playmate
how
his
heart
throbbed
with
joy
when
he
looked
at
this
brother
of
his
how
glad
he
was
too
to
find
that
paul
was
such
a
fine
strong
fellow
as
they
fought
he
took
good
care
not
to
hit
his
opponent
with
his
blunted
weapon
so
hard
as
to
hurt
him
and
if
paul
in

chanced
to
give
him
a
good
sturdy
blow
he
would
laughingly
cry
no
no
it
did
hurt
at
all
and
then
he
would
praise
him
for
his
dexterity

stood
at
her
window
and
silently
looked
on
as
they
knocked
each
other
about
in
the
garden
and
as
she
looked
up
she
wiped
away
the
tears
that
rose
to
her
eyes
they
were
indeed
tears

joy

ix
the
minster
bell
the
master
of
the
tower
and
count
zeno
were
still
conversing
together
the
marines
had
now
searched
every
corner
of
the
building
and
their
leader
returned
with
the
report
that
nothing
of
a
suspicious
nature
was
to
be
found
feodor
hereupon
took
a
in
his
hand
permit
me
said
he
to
give
my
castellan
orders
for
the
refreshment
of
your
brave
men
the
fellow
hears
badly
so
saying
he
spoke
through
the
trumpet
into
the
porter
ear
no
one
else
was
able
to
make
out
what
he
said
the
castellan
however
appeared
to
understand
the
command
he
made
a
sign
to
the
sailors
and
marines
who
stood
at
the
door
and
begged
them
to
seize
hold
of
the
on
the
floor
and
carry
it
out
of
this
surely
they
might
quite
safely
drink
the
liquor
they
reflected
could
not
well
be
poisoned
for
both
the
master
and
their
own
commander
had
drunk
from
the
cask
when
the
men
had
disappeared
feodor
rose
and
took
from
a
small
cupboard
in
the
wall
a
bottle
of
sherry
and
two
wine
glasses
which
he
filled
the
two
men
were
once
more
alone
i
am
in
no
great
hurry
to
leave
this
place
observed
count
zeno
after
a
pause
i
should
like
to
take
advantage
of
your
hospitality
for
the
night
if
you
can
make
that
convenient
i
will
explain
to
you
my
motive
for
such
a
request
before
doing
so
said
feodor
rising
allow
me
to
inform
the
lady
of
the
house
that
her
guests
are
to
stay
over
night
it
will
give
me
the
utmost
pleasure
to
make
provision
for
yourself
and
your
company
she
of
course
will
attend
to
the
comfort
of
her
guests
you
are
most
kind
observed
zeno
as
the
master
made
his
way
into
the
adjacent
room
which
was
mashinka
feodor
left
the
door
ajar
so
that
zeno
might
hear
what
was
said
there
is
only
one
bed
in
alexander
room
but
they
can
sleep
together
well
enough
for
one
night
i
suppose
of
course
they
could
alexander
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
have
paul
actually
beside
him
before
falling
asleep
no
longer
would
he
need
to
repeat
the
old
nightly
petition
that
which
he
had
so
long
asked
was
at
length
within
his
very
embrace
feodor
now
returned
to
zeno
now
sir
said
he
i
can
hear
all
you
may
have
to
say
but
first
let
us
drink
to
each
other
they
touched
glasses
bowed
to
each
other
and
drank
in
the
first
place
began
zeno
after
a
short
silence
i
may
as
well
inform
you
that
all
last
night
i
and
my
entire
crew
thought
we
heard
something
very
like
the
tolling
of
a
bell
away
in
the
distance
before
us
indeed
observed
the
master
with
the
most
perfect
calm
yes
zeno
went
on
the
tolling
quite
confused
us
my
officers
who
i
fear
are
by
no
means
too
expert
with
the
compass
and
chart
declared
that
the
sounds
must
have
proceeded
from
the
lighthouse
of
gustavsvarn
whose
lights
of
course
could
not
then
be
seen
in
the
dense
fog
on
the
other
hand
my
coxswain
who
it
is
true
is
a
clumsy
fellow
enough
swears
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
sound
of
a
bell
in
gustavsvarn
to
be
heard
in
this
quarter
for
gustavsvarn
lies
due
while
the
sound
we
heard
came
more
from
the
east
in
his
opinion
the
is
simply
nothing
but
the
pranks
of
evil
spirits
just
about
here
he
declares
there
is
a
sunken
town
on
the
deep
and
on
foggy
nights
seamen
always
hear
its
minster
bell
tolling
under
the
sea
the
sound
is
too
often
their
destruction
for
the
spectres
bell
invariably
leads
them
wherever
the
most
frightful
reefs
and
cliffs
are
to
be
found
there
is
quite
a
legend
on
the
subject
i
believe
do
you
know
the
story
at
all
oh
yes
said
feodor
quietly
i
know
it
well
pray
have
the
goodness
to
tell
it
me
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
feodor
composed
and
embellished
a
legend
of
a
sunken
town
from
which
on
dark
and
foggy
nights
was
heard
the
tolling
of
a
minster
bell
a
russian
he
reflected
even
although
a
commodore
is
by
nature
superstitious
possibly
he
imagined
he
would
be
satisfied
with
such
an
explanation
but
do
you
yourself
believe
in
this
legend
asked
zeno
with
a
searching
look
when
he
had
finished
feodor
met
his
questioner
gaze
without
a
tremor
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
pooh
he
ejaculated
why
should
i
believe
such
stuff
and
yet
pursued
zeno
there
must
be
some
truth
in
the
story
the
tolling
of
the
bell
had
actually
drawn
us
into
such
a
dangerous
position
that
had
the
fog
not
lifted
just
before
daybreak
i
and
my
vessel
should
by
this
time
have
been
at
the
bottom
together
we
dropped
anchor
not
a
moment
too
soon
but
whence
do
the
sounds
come
one
might
conclude
that
they
proceeded
from
some
church
spire
on
the
island
of
dago
itself
but
then
of
course
no
church
bells
are
ever
rung
at
night
except
at
the
service
on
christmas
eve
now
baron
helmford
can
you
explain
this
mystery
to
me
in
any
way
tolerably
well
i
fancy
said
feodor
without
having
recourse
to
any
ghost
stories
i
think
these
sounds
are
capable
of
being
explained
quite
satisfactorily
and
that
on
purely
scientific
grounds
the
sounds
i
take
it
do
in
fact
come
from
gustavsvarn
lighthouse
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
course
depresses
the
sound
which
is
then
carried
along
the
smooth
surface
of
the
water
twice
as
far
as
it
would
be
in
fine
weather
sound
has
admittedly
much
greater
travelling
power
in
such
an
atmosphere
than
in
clear
weather
yes
i
know
that
said
zeno
but
the
altered
direction
that
also
has
quite
a
simple
explanation
the
fog
itself
proceeds
from
the
this
of
course
prevents
the
tolling
of
the
bell
from
coming
in
a
perfectly
straight
line
from
gustavsvarn
moreover
the
vibrations
being
echoed
back
by
the
cliffs
of
dago
seem
even
louder
and
in
this
way
too
it
may
appear
as
if
they
actually
proceeded
from
the
island
itself
that
is
true
but
if
as
you
say
the
cliffs
of
dago
merely
echo
back
the
sound
of
the
bell
at
gustavsvarn
then
one
must
also
hear
the
tolling
perfectly
well
from
here
that
is
so
said
feodor
i
have
often
heard
it
here
very
well
then
said
zeno
i
should
like
to
convince
myself
of
the
matter
and
will
therefore
accept
your
hospitality
for
the
night
that
said
the
master
with
a
bow
i
need
hardly
repeat
you
are
most
welcome
to
do
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
count
zeno
acted
as
if
he
were
most
deeply
interested
in
all
the
sciences
he
requested
his
host
to
instruct
him
in
the
various
uses
of
all
the
instruments
which
lay
around
he
even
pretended
never
to
have
seen
a
galvanic
battery
or
a
theodolite
there
was
however
one
object
in
the
room
the
purpose
of
which
he
was
really
unable
to
divine
but
to
inquire
about
which
might
have
seemed
the
height
of
simplicity
it
was
a
long
thick
silken
cord
which
hung
down
from
the
ceiling
what
could
it
be
a
but
what
purpose
he
asked
himself
would
that
serve
the
only
servant
in
the
building
was
so
it
would
be
of
little
use
ringing
for
him
feodor
had
moved
his
chair
in
front
of
this
hanging
cord
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
any
one
to
approach
it
the
two
men
sat
and
discussed
various
scientific
experiments
and
from
time
to
time
the
wine
while
they
were
engaged
in
these
occupations
night
began
to
fall
they
could
hear
the
two
boys
talking
in
the
next
room
the
lads
wished
mashinka
and
then
went
off
to
their
bedroom
shortly
afterwards
the
men
heard
a
deep
sigh
followed
by
the
opening
words
of
a
prayer
the
woman
was
evidently
commending
her
soul
to
heaven
during
the
night
all
three
therefore
would
soon
be
asleep
now
we
may
go
up
to
the
observatory
said
feodor
rising
from
his
chair
there
we
can
listen
better
to
the
sound
of
the
bell
he
stepped
over
to
the
fireplace
in
order
to
light
a
small
hand
lamp
with
which
to
show
the
way
as
soon
as
feodor
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
turned
his
back
on
zeno
the
latter
stepped
swiftly
and
noiselessly
towards
the
silken
cord
and
pulled
it
violently
immediately
the
deep
tones
of
the
hidden
bell
sounded
from
above
ha
he
cried
in
triumphant
wrath
so
the
bell
is
here
wretch
hissed
feodor
beneath
his
breath
you
yourself
have
given
the
signal
zeno
drew
his
sword
and
sprang
to
the
door
opening
on
the
staircase
feodor
was
quite
unarmed
the
commodore
threw
the
door
open
and
shrilly
blew
his
seaman
whistle
immediately
as
if
in
response
to
the
shrill
sound
the
hurried
footsteps
of
men
were
heard
ascending
the
dark
staircase
seize
that
man
and
put
him
in
irons
ordered
zeno
pointing
with
his
naked
sword
to
feodor
but
the
men
seized
zeno
himself
tore
the
sword
from
his
grasp
and
bound
his
hands
behind
him
they
were
not
his
own
seamen
as
he
had
expected
but
the
master
hidden
companions
in
a
few
moments
he
was
bound
fast
in
the
armchair
in
which
he
had
been
comfortably
seated
a
few
minutes
before
and
ere
he
could
utter
a
word
he
was
securely
gagged
well
said
feodor
placing
himself
calmly
before
his
prisoner
so
you
have
discovered
where
the
are
and
for
whom
they
ring
doubtless
you
would
like
also
to
know
who
it
was
that
rang
i
am
count
feodor
von
ungern
the
brother
whom
you
betrayed
whom
you
falsely
accused
whom
you
had
condemned
to
lifelong
exile
whom
you
made
a
wretched
fugitive
whose
wife
you
carried
off
and
whose
child
you
branded
with
shame
since
those
days
i
have
had
no
other
thought
but
that
of
vengeance
i
built
this
tower
here
merely
that
i
might
see
your
accursed
nation
vessels
dashed
in
pieces
beneath
it
six
hundred
of
them
have
i
destroyed
already
and
your
proud
will
be
the
first
of
the
seventh
hundred
the
very
moment
you
pulled
that
cord
my
trusty
men
burst
forth
from
their
concealment
overcame
your
company
and
without
a
doubt
slew
every
one
and
now
they
will
put
on
your
men
uniforms
and
row
off
in
your
own
boat
to
your
ship
then
there
will
be
a
bath
of
blood
when
every
life
has
been
destroyed
they
will
set
fire
to
the
ship
and
let
her
burn
to
cinders
ay
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
magnificent
spectacle
from
the
tower
windows
there
you
may
enjoy
it
until
at
last
with
a
final
crash
the
hull
bursts
into
the
air
at
this
sound
our
two
boys
will
rush
out
of
bed
half
dressed
to
my
son
i
will
say
that
brand
on
your
shoulder
which
has
banished
you
for
ever
from
the
world
which
prevents
you
from
ever
calling
any
honourable
woman
your
wife
or
disclosing
your
true
name
that
mark
of
infamy
which
buries
you
alive
and
damns
you
for
ever
before
you
have
even
sinned
it
was
that
man
who
stamped
it
upon
you
he
it
was
who
robbed
you
of
your
heritage
who
robbed
you
of
your
mother
heart
of
everything
on
earth
he
has
turned
your
father
into
a
devil
and
of
earth
he
has
made
a
hell
for
you
that
man
has
a
son
there
he
stands
that
stripling
is
to
blame
for
all
your
misery
he
had
no
right
even
to
come
into
the
world
by
his
very
birth
he
utterly
destroyed
both
you
and
me
he
is
a
thief
who
has
stolen
away
your
good
name
well
you
have
there
two
swords
fall
upon
each
other
i
will
say
all
this
and
then
you
will
enjoy
the
sight
of
my
son
killing
yours
it
may
be
of
course
that
they
will
kill
each
other
but
what
matters
that
we
will
both
look
on
quite
calm
and
silent
when
they
have
done
with
each
other
i
will
loosen
your
cords
it
will
then
be
our
turn
for
do
not
think
that
i
intend
to
murder
you
like
an
assassin
no
i
will
place
your
own
sword
in
your
hand
and
then
then
may
the
devil
and
hell
judge
us
men
take
him
away
the
bound
man
writhed
in
an
agony
and
his
eyes
gazed
beseechingly
at
his
brother
but
feodor
face
remained
cold
as
marble
illustration
chapter
x
weakness
thus
then
was
the
diabolical
work
to
be
completed
for
satan
is
not
wont
to
betray
those
who
are
true
to
him
but
had
feodor
really
been
true
to
him
had
he
not
he
asked
himself
secretly
sinned
against
his
master
and
his
religion
in
suffering
beside
him
a
human
creature
who
whispered
a
prayer
to
heaven
before
laying
her
head
upon
her
pillow
and
was
that
head
really
on
the
pillow
now
was
mashinka
really
asleep
might
not
she
have
heard
all
that
had
just
been
spoken
all
those
frightful
things
which
she
could
not
hitherto
have
imagined
might
not
she
betray
him
with
these
thoughts
rushing
confusedly
through
his
brain
feodor
took
the
lamp
in
his
hand
and
entered
the
next
room
the
woman
lay
before
him
with
closed
eyes
he
threw
the
on
her
face
her
hands
were
clasped
across
her
breast
which
gently
rose
and
fell
something
whispered
to
him
that
the
woman
must
die
she
might
have
heard
everything
and
might
only
be
feigning
sleep
he
set
down
the
lamp
placing
one
hand
over
her
heart
he
held
in
the
other
a
keen
dagger
so
that
its
point
just
touched
her
breast
had
but
a
single
quickened
beat
betrayed
that
she
was
aware
of
the
danger
so
near
her
the
weapon
would
have
pierced
her
heart
but
mashinka
lay
perfectly
still
presently
a
smile
flitted
across
her
face
and
her
lips
began
to
mutter
words
as
sleepers
often
do
in
dreams
do
not
tickle
me
so
with
the
blade
of
grass
shasha
she
murmured
coyly
the
apostle
of
dago
had
not
the
heart
to
drive
the
blade
of
steel
into
her
bosom
but
something
within
him
admonished
him
thou
art
not
wholly
mine
said
the
voice
a
single
good
feeling
yet
lingers
within
thee
by
it
thou
art
corrupted
thou
art
lost
yet
he
could
not
kill
her
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
she
must
certainly
have
been
asleep
and
could
therefore
have
heard
nothing
it
would
be
sufficient
he
reflected
to
take
the
precaution
of
securing
the
key
of
the
door
which
opened
on
the
outside
steps
leading
down
to
the
garden
mashinka
and
the
two
lads
would
thus
be
all
securely
locked
in
he
left
the
room
and
went
up
to
the
observatory
mashinka
was
not
asleep
she
had
heard
every
word
with
almost
superhuman
strength
she
had
fought
down
the
terror
that
rose
within
her
and
was
able
to
appear
asleep
even
while
the
dagger
was
pointed
at
her
heart
by
the
hand
of
the
man
whom
she
now
knew
in
all
his
infamy
she
sprang
from
the
bed
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
feodor
footsteps
had
died
away
rushed
to
the
little
room
where
the
two
sleeping
boys
lay
clasping
each
other
hands
and
called
them
wake
children
wake
she
cried
in
despair
prepare
yourselves
for
death
it
is
close
at
hand
she
then
hastily
told
them
all
she
had
heard
and
you
are
to
be
made
to
fight
each
other
to
death
before
your
fathers
eyes
she
exclaimed
as
she
concluded
alexander
and
paul
tremblingly
embraced
each
other
it
was
not
the
thought
of
death
that
made
them
tremble
but
the
thought
that
their
fathers
should
hate
each
other
so
oh
if
you
could
but
fly
from
here
cried
mashinka
but
how
exclaimed
alexander
ah
the
door
to
the
garden
impossible
it
is
locked
here
cried
mashinka
suddenly
through
this
window
you
can
reach
the
garden
then
over
the
outer
wall
and
on
to
the
rocks
on
the
shore
there
you
will
find
a
boat
in
it
you
may
reach
the
ship
but
you
you
must
come
with
us
too
they
cried
together
but
mashinka
had
already
begun
to
cut
up
the
and
tie
the
pieces
together
into
a
stout
rope
the
clothes
were
not
long
enough
swiftly
she
passed
into
the
and
cut
off
the
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
with
this
the
rope
was
soon
completed
the
night
was
dark
and
favoured
the
flight
of
the
fugitives

were
now
alone
in

zeno
had
been
carried
thither
and
bound

the

window
feodor
sat
at
his
big
telescope
watching
the
anchored
vessel
at
intervals
as
he
sat
he
informed
his
prisoner
of
what
he
saw
passing

board
the

summoning

they

and
now
brother
said
feodor
the
entertainment
i
promised
you
is
about
to
begin
my
fellows
are
already
sitting
in
your
and
their
own
skiffs
the
sound
of
the
bell
is
the
signal
that
all
is
ready
with
these
words
he
left
zeno
alone
in
the
observatory
and
hurried
downstairs
to
give
the
signal
with
a
violent
effort
zeno
succeeded
in
getting
one
foot
so
far
out
of
his
bonds
that
he
could
reach
the
ground
with
his
heel
with
this
foot
he
gradually
pushed
himself
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
low
open
window
then
with
a
desperate
effort
he
tilted
the
chair
forward
and
precipitated
himself
and
it
together
into
the
depths
beneath
for
him
there
was
neither
entertainment
nor
spectacle
any
more
on
this
earth
meantime
feodor
strode
down
to
the
where
he
usually
rang
the
bell
in
the
concealed
room
by
means
of
the
silken
cord
he
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
pale
with
fear
when
he
discovered
that
the
cord
had
been
cut
illustration
the
cord
had
been
cut
he
burst
into
the
next
room
there
mashinka
bed
was
empty
he
hurried
into
his
son
bedroom
the
boys
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
open
window
and
the
rope
dangling
outside
in
the
wind
told
him
plainly
enough
of
their
flight
it
was
too
late
now
in
vain
his
cry
of
wrath
sounded
through
the
fortress
in
vain
he
pierced
with
his
sword
the
empty
bed
from
which
his
victim
had
escaped
in
vain
he
now
beat
his
breast
for
having
harboured
a
human
feeling
within
it
that
weakness
he
now
saw
had
indeed
been
his
ruin
in
his
boundless
wrath
he
rushed
up
to
the
observatory
to
wreak
all
his
baffled
vengeance
on
his
one
remaining
victim
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
at
least
could
not
escape
but
zeno
too
had
vanished
he
was
no
longer
where
he
had
left
him
feodor
stretched
his
body
far
out
of
the
open
window
and
shrieked
his
brother
name
there
was
no
response
but
the
dull
dashing
of
the
waves
against
the
rocks
below
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
and
looked
towards
the
an
icy
chill
ran
through
his
heart
the
windows
of
the
vessel
were
all
lighted
up
and
the
crew
were
lining
the
bulwarks
betrayed
utterly
betrayed
he
cried
in
despair
as
he
cursed
and
abjured
the
devil
and
all
his
works
nay
there
no
devil
there
is
nothing
nothing

nemesis
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
feodor
learned
all
that
had
taken
place
in
the
outer
world
a
company
of
armed
men
were
now
advancing
against
his
fortifications
from
the
direction
of
the
island
while
the
had
turned
her
broadside
with
its
triple
row
of
guns
against
the
tower
after
landing
a
party
to
storm
the
building
from
the
land
side
the
had
stood
off
for
the
attack
in
conformity
with
custom
the
besiegers
before
beginning
the
assault
summoned
the
fortress
to
surrender
in
order
that
the
shedding
of
blood
might
be
avoided
the
very
reverend
herr
waim≈ìner
accompanied
by
a
herald
came
as
a
messenger
of
peace
to
the
great
door
of
the
tower
and
with
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
called
upon
its
commander
to
take
part
in
peaceful
negotiations
feodor
sent
him
the
hunchback
who
acted
as
his
castellan
the
fellow
is
said
he
let
them
negotiate
with
him
but
the
hunchback
was
not
at
least
when
he
cared
to
hear
he
merely
chose
to
deceive
the
deceivers
right
well
did
he
understand
the
reverend
gentleman
summons
according
to
it
every
man
would
be
granted
free
departure
immunity
from
all
punishment
and
as
much
of
the
tower
treasure
as
his
shoulders
could
bear
if
only
the
master
were
delivered
alive
into
the
hands
of
justice
the
castellan
first
returned
and
imparted
the
news
to
those
of
his
companions
who
were
keeping
watch
at
the
door
these
passed
it
on
to
the
others
at
this
juncture
the
master
appeared
in
their
midst
as
of
yore
they
gathered
round
him
and
listened
attentively
to
his
words
men
cried
feodor
we
have
now
to
stand
the
test
of
fire
and
show
the
world
what
forty
fellows
like
us
can
do
in
a
stronghold
like
this
we
have
magnificent
guns
and
enough
ammunition
and
provisions
to
last
till
doomsday
we
will
sweep
away
all
who
attempt
to
creep
along
that
rocky
ridge
and
will
send
that
ship
to
the
bottom
should
she
dare
to
come
within
range
of
our
guns
he
paused
as
if
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
those
around
him
but
there
was
not
the
spirited
response
which
he
had
expected
even
if
we
be
overcome
he
went
on
desperately
is
it
not
enough
if
we
send
the
tower
and
our
enemies
into
the
air
together
our
hands
gripping
their
throats
to
the
last
thus
either
they
will
bear
us
aloft
with
them
to
heaven
or
we
will
drag
them
down
with
us
to
hell
up
then
and
ready
with
fire
and
sword
time
was
when
such
an
address
would
have
been
greeted
with
a
storm
of
applause
now
it
was
received
with
silence
and
strangely
sullen
faces
presently
the
hunchback
stepped
forth
from
the
band
master
he
said
i
have
heard
all
your
fine
words
for
you
see
i
am
not
always
deaf
and
must
say
now
that
it
is
a
very
beautiful
religion
this
that
you
have
taught
us
which
is
agreeable
to
me
is
right
that
which
is
hurtful
to
another
is
not
wrong
fidelity
too
is
a
virtue
then
it
is
not
for
us
the
devil
children
all
you
say
is
good
very
good
indeed
however
we
have
been
promised
freedom
and
a
sackful
of
your
treasure
if
we
only
deliver
you
up
alive
that
is
quite
agreeable
to
us
so
it
is
right
you
will
certainly
be
quartered
that
is
indeed
hurtful
to
you
so
it
is
not
wrong
if
we
do
not
remain
true
to
you
we
shall
still
please
the
devil
perfectly
for
fidelity
as
you
have
ever
preached
is
a
virtue
therefore
we
will
rather
give
you
up
than
accompany
you
in
the
a√´rial
flight
you
speak
of
they
all
laughed
loudly
in
chorus
and
feodor
laughed
strangely
along
with
them
what
is
agreeable
to
me
is
right
what
is
hurtful
to
another
is
not
wrong
the
men
shouted
derisively
in
his
very
face
this
then
was
to
be
the
triumph
of
his
religion
they
had
evidently
learned
their
lesson
only
too
well
from
him
but
you
will
get
nothing
by
your
treachery
exclaimed
the
master
suddenly
and
ere
they
could
lay
hands
on
him
he
had
drawn
a
pistol
from
his
belt
there
was
a
click
and
a
flash
and
feodor
von
ungern
fell
dead
in
their
midst
alexander
and
paul
returned
to
russia
and
like
brothers
shared
the
property
of
their
estranged
parents
between
them
but
the
tower
of
dago
still
rises
high
above
the
rocky
promontory
of
the
island
and
serves
as
the
safe
untroubled
haunt
of
the
wild
for
miles
around
